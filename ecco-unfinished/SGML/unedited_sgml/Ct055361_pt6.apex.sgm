<HEAD>In NORTH-HOLLAND the towns &s;ending deputies to the &s;tates are,</HEAD>
<P>ALkmaar, &s;ituated about twenty-three miles from Am&s;terdam, to the north. It is one of the mo&s;t beautiful and be&s;t built towns in this part of the country, and is &s;urrounded with plea&s;ant gardens, walks, and meadows, in the la&s;t of which are kept great numbers of cows. Hence a large trade is carried on in chee&s;e and butter, by which the inhabitants, who are mo&s;tly papi&s;ts, are en|riched. The road and canal from hence to Beem|&s;ter, and the canal to Hoorn, are exceeding plea|&s;ant; as are al&s;o the walks upon the ramparts. In 1637, there was an auction of tulips here, of which &s;ome were &s;old for three or four thou&s;and, and &s;ome even for five thou&s;and, guilders each. This flower-phrenzy at la&s;t ro&s;e to &s;uch a height, that the &s;tates were obliged to put a &s;top to it by &s;e|vere penalties.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="30">
Hoorn, &s;ituated on a bay of the Zuyder-&s;ee, &s;e|venteen miles from Am&s;terdam, to the north. On the land &s;ide are rich pa&s;tures, fine gardens, plea|&s;ant walks, and canals. Great numbers of cattle are brought hither from Denmark, and fattened in the adjacent meadows. A train of villages runs from the extremity of one of the walks, to the gates of Enkhui&s;en. The town has a good harbour, an India-hou&s;e, a great annual fair in May, a fine dock, in which men of war and mer|chant-&s;hips are built, and a con&s;iderable traffic in butter and chee&s;e. It has al&s;o a &s;hare in the whaie fi&s;hery; with a college of admiralty, which meets here and at Enkhui&s;en alternately, every three months; and is the &s;eat of the mint of North-Hol|land, alternately with Einkhui&s;en and Medenblik.</P>
<P>Enkhui&s;en, which &s;tands al&s;o on the Zuyder-&s;ee, eleven miles from Hoorn, and has a good har|bour, &s;everal churches belonging to different &s;ects, an Ea&s;t and We&s;t-India hou&s;e, a provincial maga|zine, a foundery for cannon, a great trade in &s;hip|building and &s;alt, and a &s;hare in the herring-fi&s;hery. It is al&s;o well fortified, and the &s;eat of an admiralty|college, and the mint-office for North-Holland, alternately with Hoorn.</P>
<P>Edam, &s;ituated at a &s;mall di&s;tance from the Zuyder-&s;ee, with which it has a communication, and a trade in timber, train-oil, &s;alt, and &s;hip|building. Near it was formerly a great lake, called the Purmer, which is now drained, and converted into rich land. A mermaid, or &s;ea|nymph, is &s;aid to have been found here in 1430, which learned to dre&s;s, eat, and make the &s;ign of the cro&s;s, but not to &s;peak, tho' &s;he lived &s;everal years.</P>
<P>Monnikendam, on a &s;mall bay of the Zuyder-&s;ee, about eight miles from Am&s;terdam to the north ea&s;t. The inhabitants live chiefly by fi&s;hing, &s;oap-boiling, and &s;ilk-weaving, the harbour hav|ing
<PB N="5" REF="40">
been quite choaked up with &s;and. It takes its name from the lake of Monnika, which has a communication with the Zuyder-&s;ee, by means of a canal. In the town-hou&s;e is &s;aid to be kept the collar of the order of the Golden Fleece, taken from count Bo&s;&s;u, admiral of the Spani&s;h fleet, that was defeated by the Dutch in 1573, near Hoorn.</P>
<P>Medenblick, commonly called Memelick, ly|ing al&s;o on the Zuyder-&s;ee, about &s;even miles from Enkhui&s;en. It is &s;mall but well fortified, and has a noble harbour that will contain three hundred &s;ail. The dykes here are exceeding &s;trong and high, yet &s;uch is the fury of the waves, that &s;ome|times they threaten to break through or overflow them. The trade of this town con&s;i&s;ts chiefly in tim|ber brought from Norway and the Baltic, be&s;ides, in the neighbourhood are bred and fed va&s;t numbers of cattle. This town was antiently the capital of North Holland, and the &s;eat of the Fri&s;ian kings.</P>
<P>Purmeren, the la&s;t town of North Holland that &s;ends deputies to the &s;tates, taking its name from the Purmer abovementioned, at one end of which it &s;tands, thirteen miles from Am&s;terdam to the north. The neighbouring country was formerly full of lakes and mar&s;hes, which are now drained and converted into gardens, orchards, rich pa&s;tures, highways, dykes, and canals.</P>
<P>The other places in North Holland worth men|tioning are,</P>
<P>Sardam, or Zardam, a large and wealthy town at the mouth of the Zaan, which falls into the Y, about five miles from Am&s;terdam, to the north-we&s;t. Above three hundred ve&s;&s;els are &s;aid to be built here in a year; and a man of war could be built every week if there was occa&s;ion, and all ma|terials provided. The mills of all kinds about the town exceed two thou&s;and in number. Many rich
<PB N="6" REF="50">
merchants re&s;ide here, and a great trade is carried on in grain, timber, blubber, and many other commodities.</P>
<P>Egmont, the name of two villages, at one of which are the ruins of the old palace of the counts of Egmont.</P>
<P>Beverwyk, a hand&s;ome town on Wykermeer, who&s;e inhabitants are mo&s;tly gardeners, and &s;upply Am&s;terdam with all kinds of vegetables.</P>
<P>Petten, a village on the North-&s;ea, famous for oy&s;ters.</P>
<P>Helder, a village at the extremity of North Holland. Mo&s;t of the inhabitants are pilots, employed in carrying out or bringing in &s;hips through the Mar&s;diep, by which the Zuyder-&s;ee communicates with the North Sea. We&s;t of it is a fine road called the Land&s;diep, which in time of war is the rendezvous of the Dutch fleets.</P>
<P>Brock, a large and hand&s;ome village. Nothing, it is &s;aid, can exceed it in point of cleanline&s;s and neatne&s;s.</P>
<P>Schagen, a large open town fourteen miles to the we&s;t of Medenblick. The adjacent country is reckoned the riche&s;t &s;oil in Europe. Not far from hence is Obdam, a village, which gives title to a branch of the noble family of Wa&s;&s;enaar.</P>
<P>The greater part of the continent of North Hol|land con&s;i&s;ts of drained lakes and mar&s;hes, in con&s;e|quence of which it is full of canals, dykes, ditches, and &s;luices. Of the i&s;lands that lie about it the mo&s;t noted is the Texel, which is parted from the continent by a channel called the Mar&s;diep. It is very fruit|ful, breeds great numbers of &s;heep, and contains &s;ix villages: on the ea&s;tern coa&s;t of it is a good road, called Mo&s;co road. In 1672, the duke of York intended to have landed here, but was prevented by an ebb that continued twelve hours, and was &s;ucceeded by a &s;torm.</P>

<HEAD>ZEALAND.</HEAD>
<P>This province, called in Dutch Zeeland, or See|land, from its &s;ituation, has Holland to the north, Flanders to the &s;outh, Brabant to the ea&s;t, and the German ocean to the we&s;t. It con&s;i&s;ts entirely of i&s;lands formed by the &s;everal branches and outlets of the Scheld, and guarded again&s;t the &s;ea by dykes of great height and thickne&s;s. The &s;oil is very fruitful, yielding wheat, good fruits, rich pa&s;ture, great quantities of madder, but little or no fuel of any kind, with which, however, it is well &s;upplied, either from the other provinces, or from England and Scotland. There is plenty of fi&s;h, e&s;pecially of the &s;hell-kind, and of all other kinds of provi&s;ions; the flocks of &s;heep are large and numerous, and their wool very fine; the pro|vince, in general, is very wealthy and populous, and carries on a great traffic; though the air agrees not with &s;trangers, yet the natives, who are born and bred in it, enjoy a pretty good &s;tate of health. The &s;everal i&s;lands had antiently lords of their own, afterwards they became &s;ubject to the counts of Holland, and, with that province, fell to the hou&s;e of Burgundy, then to the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria, and at la&s;t joined with the other provinces in the union of Utrecht. The a&s;&s;embly of the &s;tates, con&s;i&s;ting of &s;even members, is held at Middle|burg; and the prince of Orange, as marquis of Flu&s;hing and Terveere, is pre&s;ident of it. To the a&s;&s;embly of the &s;tates-general, Zealand &s;ends four deputies, who hold their office for life. The prin|cipal tribunals and boards are, two high courts of ju&s;tice, a college of admiralty, and a chamber of accounts. The clergy are divided into four cla&s;&s;es, making altogether &s;ixty-three mini&s;ters. A &s;ynod meets only when convened by the &s;tates, and that
<PB N="8" REF="70">
only on extraordinary occa&s;ions. The principal places in it are,</P>
<P>Middleburg, the capital, &s;ituated in the i&s;land of Walcheren, which is of a round figure, about eleven miles from &s;outh to north, and near as ma|ny from ea&s;t to we&s;t. The city is large and well fortified, and contains &s;everal churches, belonging to different &s;ects, a Jewi&s;h &s;ynagogue, and mint. It is al&s;o the place where the &s;tates a&s;&s;emble, and where the high courts and colleges are held. It &s;eems to have borrowed its name from its &s;ituation in the middle of the i&s;land, five miles from Flu&s;h|ing, forty-two from Rotterdam, and thirty-four from O&s;tend. Ships of four hundred tons can come up to it by a broad deep canal, a mile and an half in length, and it is not only large, but hand&s;ome, populous, rich, and flouri&s;hing, being inhabited by many wealthy merchants, who carry on a great trade to the Ea&s;t and We&s;t-Indies, France, Spain, and Portugal, be&s;ides having a large &s;hare in the herring and whale fi&s;heries. Middleburg was erected into a bi&s;hop's &s;ee, by Pope Paul IV. but being not long after taken by the prince of Orange, after a &s;iege of two years, the bi&s;hopric was &s;uppre&s;&s;ed. There are &s;everal fine &s;quares and public buildings here. Among the latter, in particular, is St. Nicholas's abbey, where the &s;tates a&s;&s;emble, and the high colleges are held; and the town-hou&s;e, who&s;e clock and dial has &s;aid to have co&s;t an hundred and fifty thou|&s;and guilders. Here is al&s;o a gymna&s;ium illu&s;tre. The i&s;land in which the city &s;tands, though not the large&s;t, is the mo&s;t fruitful and populous of all the Zealand i&s;lands.</P>
<P>Vli&s;&s;ingen or Flu&s;hing, &s;ituated in the &s;ame i&s;land, at the mouth of the Hondt or We&s;ter&s;cheld, about five miles from Middleburg, is well fortified, has a fine harbour, and a good trade, and though not
<PB N="9" REF="80">
&s;o large, or &s;o well built, as Middleburg, yet con|tains &s;everal fine &s;tructures. It &s;hook off the Spa|ni&s;h yoke in 1572, and voluntarily &s;ubmitted to the &s;tates. In 1585 it was mortgaged to queen Elizabeth, together with the Briel and Rammekins, but re&s;tored by James I. Sir Philip Sidney was governor of it while in the hands of the Engli&s;h. Loaded ve&s;&s;els come up to the very doors of the merchants. The famous admiral de Ruyter, who ro&s;e from a common &s;eaman and pilot to be admiral of the United-Provinces, was born here, in 1607. The prince of Orange, as marquis of Flu&s;hing and Veer, or Ter-Veer, is fir&s;t nobleman of the pro|vince, and pre&s;ident in the a&s;&s;embly of the &s;tates.</P>
<P>Veer or Ter-Veer, antiently Campveer, which &s;tands in the &s;ame i&s;land, on the north &s;ide of it, at the mouth of the Ea&s;t Schelde, about four miles from Middleburg, and eight from Flu&s;hing. Veer, in Dutch, &s;ignifies a pa&s;&s;age or ferry, over an arm of the &s;ea or a river; and as there was once a ferry here over the Schelde, to the village of Compen, on the i&s;land of North Beve|land, the town thereby got the name of Veer, Camp-Veer, and Ter-Veer. It is well fortified, and enjoys a good trade, e&s;pecially to Scotland, the natives of which enjoy particular privileges here. The ar&s;enal is the be&s;t furni&s;hed in the pro|vince, and the harbour a very good one. The Calvini&s;ts alone are allowed the public exerci&s;e of their religion in this town; whence the Veres, an|tiently earls of Oxford, are &s;aid to have derived both their origin and name. The two following towns are al&s;o &s;ituated in the i&s;land of Wal|charen, but &s;end no deputies to the &s;tates.</P>
<P>Arnemuyden, commonly called Armuijen, taking its name from Muyde, a mouth, and Arne, the name of a &s;mall river or canal, at no great di&s;tance, at the mouth of which the town originally &s;tood. It
<PB N="10" REF="90">
was once a large thriving town, but the harbour having been choaked up with &s;and, it fell to decay, and now &s;ub&s;i&s;ts chiefly by making and refining &s;alt.</P>
<P>We&s;t-Kappel, an open place on the we&s;t &s;ide of the Schelde.</P>
<P>Rammekens, or Zeeburg, a &s;mall fort &s;tanding at the mouth of Middleburg harbour, which, as we have already ob&s;erved, was mortgaged to queen Elizabeth.</P>
<P>Haak, a fort to the north-we&s;t of Ter-Veer, which commands the Veer-Gat, through which the &s;hipping mu&s;t pa&s;s into the Ea&s;t-Schelde.</P>
<P>In the i&s;land of South Beveland, otherwi&s;e called the Land-van-ter-Goes, and which is both the large&s;t and plea&s;ante&s;t of all the i&s;lands of Zeeland, the principal places are,</P>
<P>Goes or Ter-Goes, in the mo&s;t northern part of the i&s;land, not far from the Ea&s;t-Schelde, with which it has a communication by a channel de|fended by two forts. Though not large, it is neat|ly built, and pretty well fortified, and carries on a great trade; be&s;ides, it is the only town on the i&s;land that &s;ends deputies to the &s;tates. Along the dyke of the haven or canal are &s;ome &s;alt-pans.</P>
<P>Bor&s;elen or Mon&s;ter, a village belonging to the Bor&s;elen family. A town of the &s;ame name &s;tood formerly in the neighbourhood, which was de&s;troy|ed by an inundation in 1532.</P>
<P>In the &s;mall i&s;land of North Beveland, the only place worth mentioning is Kortgene, a country|town, belonging to the family of Na&s;&s;au-Odyk.</P>
<P>In the i&s;land of Schowen, which is about &s;even|teen miles long, and &s;even or eight broad, and abounds with gentlemen's &s;eats, rich farms, and in|clo&s;ures, the principal places are,</P>
<P>Zirk&s;ee, or Zurich-&s;ee, on the &s;outh &s;ide of the i&s;land, about thirteen miles from Middleburg. It
<PB N="11" REF="100">
&s;ends deputies to the &s;tates, and is in a flouri&s;hing condition, having a good harbour, and near an hundred &s;ail of &s;hips. The commodities it deals in are chiefly &s;alt, fi&s;h, e&s;pecially oy&s;ters, madder, and mead.</P>
<P>Brouwer&s;haven, a &s;mall town, with a convenient harbour, the inhabitants of which are either &s;ea|men or fi&s;hermen. The celebrated James Cats, grand-pen&s;ionary of Holland and We&s;t-Frie&s;land, and one of the mo&s;t eminent Dutch poets, was born here, and died in 1660.</P>
<P>In the i&s;land of Duiveland, which took its name from the great numbers of duives, or pigeons, with which it formerly abounded: though pretty large, there are no towns, but &s;everal villages, which however merit not a de&s;cription.</P>
<P>In the i&s;land of Tholen, which is near eight miles long, and four broad, the only place worth men|tioning is that which gives name to it, viz. Tholen, or Ter-Tholen, which &s;tands on the river Een|dracht, is pretty well fortified, and &s;ends deputies to the &s;tates. It had its name from a toll-hou&s;e erected here by the counts of Zealand. The neighbouring di&s;trict is very fruitful, being what they call polders, i. e. drained lands, inclo&s;ed with banks. The prince of Orange has a large e&s;tate in this i&s;land.</P>
<P>There is another &s;mall i&s;land in the province, called St. Philip's I&s;land, but it contains no town, and only one village, which gives name to the i&s;land. Though the i&s;land of Over-Flaque is in the province of Holland, yet Sommel&s;dyk, or Zomerdyk, a country-town in it, belongs to Zea|land.</P>
</DIV3>

<PB N="12" REF="110">
<HEAD>UTRECHT.</HEAD>
<P>This province is wholly &s;urrounded by Holland and Gelderland, excepting a &s;mall part of it that borders on the Zuyder-&s;ee. Its greate&s;t length is about thirty-two miles, and breadth about twenty-two. It enjoys a good air, and in mo&s;t places the &s;oil is fruitful, but in &s;ome, &s;andy, or what is called turf-ground, and in others over-run with wood. It is watered by the Leck, Rhine, Vecht, and other &s;maller rivers, be&s;ides &s;everal canals, of which that extending from the village of Vree&s;|wyk to Utrecht is one of the chief. The &s;tates here, as in the other provinces, are compo&s;ed of the nobility, and the towns; the latter of which are Utrecht, Amersfoort, Wyk, Rhenen, and Mont|foort; but Utrecht bears the chief &s;way. The bi|&s;hops of that city were antiently temporal lords of the province, as well as of Overy&s;&s;el, till Henry of Bavaria &s;old the &s;overeignty thereof to Charles V. In 1559 the &s;ee of Utrecht was rai&s;ed to an archbi|&s;hopric by Philip II. of Spain. In 1579 it acceded to the alliance of the other provinces, and became a free &s;tate. The provincial &s;tates are compo&s;ed of twelve members, and three deputies are &s;ent by them to the a&s;&s;embly of the &s;tates-general. The e&s;tabli&s;hed clergy are divided into three cla&s;&s;es, making &s;eventy-nine mini&s;ters, of whom a &s;ynod is held once a-year at Utrecht. The principal places in the province are,</P>
<P>Utrecht, in Latin Ultrajectum, Trajectum vetus or inferius, or Trajectum ad Rhenum, &s;o called from its antient ferry or pa&s;&s;age here over the Rhine, the word being compounded of trecht, which in Dutch &s;ignifies a ferry, and oud or olt, i. e. old. It is a fair, large, and populous city, the capital of the province, and the &s;eat of the &s;tates, &s;ituated nineteen miles from Am&s;terdam, twenty-five from Rotter|dam,
<PB N="13" REF="120">
and twenty-&s;even from Leyden. There were &s;everal large and rich mona&s;teries, and other reli|gious hou&s;es, here before the Reformation. The churches are magnificent, e&s;pecially that of St. Martin, formerly the cathedral, and u&s;ually called the dome. Over that of St. Salvador or the old min&s;ter, where the Engli&s;h have a place of wor|&s;hip, is a mu&s;aeum of all &s;orts of antiques and rarities. The only defence of the city is a wall on the old canal. Here is a &s;tately town-hou&s;e, with a commandery of the Tentonic order, and a cele|brated univer&s;ity, which was founded in 1636, &s;ince which it hath flouri&s;hed greatly, tho' it has not all the privileges of mo&s;t other univer&s;ities, being wholly &s;ubject to the magi&s;trates of the city. The mall, without the town, having five rows of lofty limes on each &s;ide, is very plea&s;ant; and the phy&s;ic-garden, belonging to the univer&s;ity, is extremely curious. There are five churches here that have chapters; but the members of the&s;e purcha&s;e their places, of which &s;ome co&s;t &s;ix or &s;even thou&s;and guilders. The &s;treams which run through &s;everal of the &s;treets, contribute much to the beauty and clean|line&s;s of the town; and the canal that is cut from the Leck, and pa&s;&s;es through it to Am&s;terdam, will carry &s;hips of any burthen. Pope Adrian VI. was a native of this city. His epitaph is worth in&s;erting: Adrianus Sextus hic &s;itus e&s;t, qui nihil &s;ibi in vita infelicius duxit, quam quod imperaret, i. e. Adrian VI. lies here, who reckoned it his greate&s;t misfor|tune that he &s;hould ever have been called to govern|ment. Here, in 1579, the memorable union was formed between the &s;even provinces; and, in 1713, the celebrated peace concluded, between France on the one part, and the allies on the other. The pa|pi&s;ts have a nominal archbi&s;hop of this city; and there is a &s;ilk manufactory carried on in it, which employs a number of hands.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="130">
Amersfoort, which &s;tands on the river Eem, in a plea&s;ant fertile country, &s;eventeen miles from Utrecht, and &s;ix from the Zuyder-&s;ee, taking its name from a fort on the river. Large quantities of German goods and commodities are conveyed from hence, down the Eem, to Am&s;terdam. Its beer and tobacco trade are much declined, but its manufactures of dimity and bombazine thrive apace. It is of no great &s;trength, being command|ed by a hill called Amersforderberg, upon the edge of which is the plea&s;ant palace of Soed&s;tyk, belong|ing to the hou&s;e of Orange. The government here is much like that of Utrecht, and they enjoy much the &s;ame privileges.</P>
<P>Rhenen, which takes its name from the Rhine, near which it is &s;ituated upon the declivity of a hill, about nineteen miles from Utrecht. Here the un|fortunate Frederic V. elector Palatine, and king of Bohemia, re&s;ided, when he retired with his family into the United Provinces. It is but a &s;mall mean place, though it had once counts of its own. From the neighbouring hill of Heymenberg is a mo&s;t beautiful and exten&s;ive pro&s;pect.</P>
<P>Wyk-te-Duur&s;tede, &s;ituate on the Rhine, twelve miles from Utrecht, where the famous Batavodu|rum is &s;uppo&s;ed to have &s;tood. For want of trade, this place decays apace.</P>
<P>Montfoort, the la&s;t of the towns that &s;end depu|ties to the a&s;&s;emblies of the &s;tates took its name from a fort erected here, in 1175, by Godfrey, bi&s;hop of Rhenen, and is a &s;mall place on the Dutch Y&s;&s;el, &s;ix miles from Utrecht.</P>
<P>Amerongen, a hand&s;ome country town, be|longing to the noble family of Rheede.</P>
<P>Leer&s;um, a free lord&s;hip, belonging, together with Zuile&s;tein, to the earl of Rochfort, in Eng|land.</P>

<HEAD>FRIESELAND.</HEAD>
<P>This province is called in Dutch Vrie&s;land, and in Latin Fri&s;ia, from the Fri&s;ians, its antient in|habitants, who&s;e &s;ettlements extended along the German ocean, from the We&s;er to the Scheld, and were di&s;tingui&s;hed by the names of Ea&s;t and We&s;t Frie&s;land. Of the former, the province we are now de&s;cribing forms a part, being bounded we&s;tward by the Flie; ea&s;tward by the provinces of Groningen and Overy&s;&s;el, and the country of Drenthe; northward by the German ocean; and &s;outhward by the Zuyder-&s;ee and Overy&s;&s;el. Its greate&s;t extent from north to &s;outh is twenty-&s;even miles, and from ea&s;t to we&s;t thirty-two. The air and &s;oil here are much like tho&s;e of Holland. In the lower parts the pa&s;tures are very rich, and feed great numbers of large oxen, &s;heep, cows, and hor&s;es. In the higher are &s;ome good corn-lands, with turf-grounds, heaths, and woods. There are al&s;o many lakes in this province. To guard it again&s;t the inundations of the &s;ea, &s;trong high dykes have been erected all along the coa&s;t, there being few or no &s;and-hills. Like Holland, it is inter&s;ected with a great number of canals for draining off the water, and facilitating commerce. The inhabitants are &s;till great lovers of liberty, and retain many of the cu&s;toms of their ance&s;tors. The language of &s;ome parts of the country, it is &s;aid, comes nearer to the old Engli&s;h than any other in Europe. There are great numbers of Men|nonites or anabapti&s;ts here; Menno Simon, from whom they took their name, having been a native of the province. The linen made here is the fine&s;t in Europe: the woollen &s;tuffs al&s;o are much e&s;teem|ed. Frie&s;eland had formerly princes of its own, who had for &s;ome time the title of dukes, then of

In 1515, Charles V. re|duced it under his dominion; but it &s;hook off the yoke under his &s;on Philip, and acceded to the Utrecht alliance. The whole a&s;&s;embly of the &s;tates here con&s;i&s;ts of eighty-two per&s;ons, each town and grieteny or di&s;trict &s;ending two, and the number of towns being eleven, and of the grie|tenies thirty. To the a&s;&s;embly of the &s;tates ge|neral the province &s;ends five deputies; and here, as in the other provinces, is a provincial court of ju&s;tice, a chamber of accounts, and a committee of the &s;tates. The Calvini&s;t mini&s;ters amount to two hundred and &s;even, who form &s;ix cla&s;&s;es, and hold a &s;ynod, annually and alternately, at the prin|cipal towns, of which the chief are,</P>
<P>Leuwarden, the capital of the province, and the &s;eat of its chief colleges. It is a large, hand|&s;ome, populous city, about &s;ixty miles from Am|&s;terdam to the north-ea&s;t, and &s;even from the Ger|man ocean to the &s;outh. Here is a mint, many pa|laces of the nobility, &s;everal churches belonging to different &s;ects, a Jewi&s;h &s;ynagogue, and a &s;tately town-hou&s;e. By its navigable canals, the town carries on a good trade with Hamburg, Bremen, Embden, and Holland. In its neighbourhood is Marienburg, a &s;eat belonging to the hou&s;e of Na&s;|&s;au-Orange, who, being hereditary-&s;tadtholders of the province, re&s;ided here till the year 1747, when they were made &s;tadtholders of all the United-Provinces. The fortifications, at pre&s;ent, are much neglected.</P>
<P>Bol&s;werd, an antient town, five miles from Franeker to the &s;outh, and four from the Zuy|der&s;ee to the ea&s;t. It was once a Han&s;e town. The greate&s;t part of the Frie&s;eland baize is wove here.</P>

Franeker, a town about ten miles from Leu|warden, and four from the Zuyder-&s;ee is neither large nor fortified, but has an univer&s;ity, which was opened in the year 1585, and a phy&s;ic-garden. The &s;alaries of the profe&s;&s;ors are paid out of the re|venues of the old mona&s;teries; and the &s;tudents, neither in this nor the other univer&s;ities of the pro|vinces, pay any tax for their wine and beer.

of Gelderland; to the ea&s;t by the county of Ben|theim, and the bi&s;hopric of Mun&s;ter; and to the we&s;t by the Zuyder-&s;ee. It has the name of Over-Y&s;&s;el from its &s;ituation in re&s;pect of Holland, Utrecht, and part of Gelderland. Its greate&s;t extent from north to &s;outh, including the territory of Drenthe, is about fifty-&s;even miles, and from ea&s;t to we&s;t about forty-three. With re&s;pect to the &s;oil, it is in general far inferior to the other pro|vinces, being full of &s;ands, heaths, and mar&s;hes; yet, in &s;ome places, they have good corn land and pa&s;ture. The &s;tates con&s;i&s;t of the nobilty, and the towns of Deventer, Kampen, and Zwol, in which their annual a&s;&s;emblies are alternately held. The province was long &s;ubject to the bi&s;hops of Utrecht, till bi&s;hop Henry of Bavaria transferred it to Charles V. and, in 1580, it acceded to the union of Utrecht. Here are high tribunals and colleges, an&s;wering to tho&s;e of the other provinces; and five deputies are commonly &s;ent from hence to the a&s;&s;embly of the &s;tates-general. The clergy of the e&s;tabli&s;hed re|ligion, who are divided into four cla&s;&s;es, making in all eighty-four mini&s;ters, hold their annual &s;y|nods alternately in the chief towns. The mo&s;t re|markable places in the province are,</P>
<P>Deventer, in the quarter of Salland, on the Y&s;&s;el, over which it has a bridge of boats, eight miles from Zutphen, forty-four from Utrecht, and a|bout eighteen from the Zuyder-&s;ee. It is a neat, populous, well built, and well fortified city, con|taining &s;everal churches belonging to different &s;ects, a gymna&s;ium illu&s;tre, a mint, and an iron foundery; and five annual fairs are held here. They brew al&s;o a plea&s;ant &s;ort of beer, and have a good trade. A|long the river-&s;ide is a fine key, adorned with rows of trees. Deventer was formerly an imperial and Han&s;e town, and al&s;o, for a &s;hort time, a bi&s;hop's &s;ee.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="190">
Kampen, a &s;mall town, &s;tanding al&s;o on the Y&s;&s;el, a little above where it falls into the Zuy|der-&s;ee. Its chief &s;trength lies in its &s;ituation, which being in a low ground, the country about it may be ea&s;ily laid under water. The wooden bridge here is a curious &s;tructure, &s;tanding upon va&s;t piles, or pieces of timber, drove into the bot|tom of the river. Kampen has the privilege of a mint, as well as Deventer, and was once al&s;o a free imperial city. Its trade is greatly declined, &s;ince its harbour became incapable of admitting large ve&s;&s;els.</P>
<P>Zwol or Zwolle, the hand&s;ome&s;t and mo&s;t wealthy town in the Province, &s;ituated on the river Aa or Blackwater, by which it has a com|munication with the Zuyder-&s;ee, and a good trade. It &s;tands &s;ixteen miles from Deventer to the north, and is &s;trongly fortified, containing &s;everal churches and ho&s;pitals, an ar&s;enal, a college, and a granary. Thomas &agrave; Kempis was prior of a mona&s;tery near this town. The provincial &s;tates meet here, at De|venter, and Kampen, by turns. There is a large di&s;trict under the juri&s;diction of the town.</P>

<P>This province is bounded on the north by the German ocean; on the &s;outh by the county of Drenthe; on the ea&s;t by the bi&s;hopric of Mun&s;ter, and the principality of Ea&s;t-Frie&s;eland; and on the we&s;t by the province of Frie&s;eland, from which it is parted by the river Lawers. Its greate&s;t length from &s;outh-ea&s;t to north-we&s;t is about forty-&s;even miles, but its breadth very unequal, the greate&s;t being about thirty-three miles. The air and &s;oil are much the &s;ame as tho&s;e of Frie&s;eland; for here al&s;o are rich pa&s;tures, large herds of great and &s;mall cattle, plenty of &s;ea and river fi&s;h, and of turf, with &s;ome fore&s;ts, and corn-land. There are &s;eve|ral rivers in the province, of which the principal is the Hun&s;e; and a great number of canals and dykes. The &s;tates con&s;i&s;t of the deputies of the town of Groningen, and the Ommeland, or cir|cumjacent country, and hold their a&s;&s;emblies al|ways in the town of Groningen. The province had antiently governors, under the title of bur|graves; but their power being limited, the people enjoyed great privileges. Afterwards, it became &s;ubject to the bi&s;hop of Utrecht; but &s;hook off his yoke, at la&s;t, and recovered its liberty. In 1536, however, it &s;ubmitted to Charles V. and, in 1579, acceded to the union of Utrecht. The colleges are much the &s;ame here as in the other provinces, viz. the provincial &s;tates, council of &s;tate-provincial tribunal, and chamber of accompts. Six deputies are &s;ent from hence to the &s;tates-gene|ral. Or the e&s;tabli&s;hed clergy, there are an hun|dred and &s;ixty mini&s;ters, which form &s;even cla&s;&s;es, who&s;e annual &s;ynod is held, by turns, at Groningen

<P>Groningen, the capital, twenty-&s;even miles from Leuwarden, fifty-eight from Deventer, twenty-four from Embden, eighty from Am&s;terdam, and twelve from the neare&s;t &s;hore of the German ocean, at the conflux of &s;everal rivulets, which form the Hun&s;e and Fivel. Ships of con&s;iderable burthen can come up to the city, in con&s;equence of which it enjoys a pretty good trade. It was former|ly very &s;trong, but its fortifications are now much neglected. The univer&s;ity here was founded in 1615, and is well endowed out of the revenues of the antient mona&s;teries. The town, which was formerly one of the Han&s;e, and has &s;till great privi|leges, is large and populous, being the &s;eat of the high-colleges, and containing three &s;pacious market-places, and twenty-&s;even &s;treets, in which are many fine hou&s;es, be&s;ides churches, and other public &s;tructures. By the river Fivel, and the Eems, it has a communication with We&s;tphalia. In 1672, it made &s;uch a gallant re&s;i&s;tance again&s;t the bi&s;hop of Mun&s;ter, that he is &s;aid to have lo&s;t ten thou&s;and men before it. Rodolphus Agricola and Ve&s;elius, two of the mo&s;t learned men of the age in which they lived, were born here.

The &s;outh parts are full of mar&s;hes; of the others, &s;ome are over-run with wood, and &s;ome yield good pa&s;ture, wheat, and rye. What &s;eems a little odd, we are told that the wheat harve&s;t here always begins on a par|ticular day, and ends on another. The &s;tates con|&s;i&s;t of the nobles and freeholders: of the former who &s;it and vote, there are eighteen, and of free|holders thirty-&s;ix. The a&s;&s;embly of the &s;tates is held annually at A&s;&s;en, and the pre&s;ident is always nominated by the &s;tadtholder; but no deputies are &s;ent from hence to the &s;tates-general, though the country contributes one per cent. to all the public expences of the provinces, and is under their pro|tection. Be&s;ides the &s;tates, here is a &s;overeign court of ju&s;tice, which decides without appeal, and a college, which puts in execution the re&s;olu|tions of the diet. Of the e&s;tabli&s;hed clergy there are three cla&s;&s;es, who have a &s;ynod yearly at A&s;&s;en. The only places of any note in this country are,</P>

<HEAD>The GENERALITE LANDS.</HEAD>
<P>By the Generalit&egrave; Lands are meant tho&s;e parts of the divided Netherlands that belong to the &s;tates-general, or the united provinces in general. Though the&s;e territories are not members of the &s;tate, yet they retain all the privileges they en|joyed, when they fell under the dominion of the republic. The hereditary &s;tadtholder is governor-general of them all. There al&s;o are &s;ome gover|nors of fortre&s;&s;es; but the power of the&s;e is limited to the &s;oldiery. The high tribunals for the admi|ni&s;tration of ju&s;tice in the Generalit&egrave; Lands &s;it at the Hague, Middleburg, and Venlo. The e&s;ta|bli&s;hed religion is Calvini&s;m, as in the provinces, but all &s;ects are tolerated. The&s;e lands con&s;i&s;t of a part of the duchies of Brabant and Limburg, of the upper quarter of Gelderland, and of Flanders. The principal places belonging to the &s;tates in the duchy of Brabant are,</P>
<P>Bois le Duc, in Latin Silva Ducis, &s;ituated at the conflux of the Aa and Dommel, which, when united, are called the Die&s;t, twenty miles from Breda, forty from Antwerp, and twenty-&s;ix from Utrecht. The town is &s;trong both by nature and art; be&s;ides the adjacent country may be laid un|der water. The majority of the inhabitants are Roman catholics. Their trade and &s;hipping are con&s;iderable, and there are manufactures of linen and woollen cloth, cutlery wares, and needles. The town, which contains &s;everal churches and ma&s;s-hou&s;es, a gymna&s;ium illu&s;tre, and citadel, took its name from its having been at fir&s;t built in a wood, cleared and cut down for that purpo&s;e, by order of Godfrey III. duke of Brabant. It was
<PB N="25" REF="240">
once a bi&s;hopric; and the cathedral, which is now in the hands of the prote&s;tants, is one of the mo&s;t magnificent in the Netherlands. Before the Re|formation there were &s;ixteen mona&s;teries of both &s;exes here. In the di&s;trict to which the town gives name, are the towns of O&s;terwyk, Tilborg, Box|tel, Einhoven, Gir&s;chot, Helmond, Os, Grave, and Rave&s;tein. The Grave is &s;trongly fortified, and belongs to the prince of Orange, who is al&s;o proprietor of the barony of Kuik, and other e&s;tates in the di&s;trict. Rave&s;tein, with the lord&s;hip to which it gives name, are held as fiefs of the &s;tates-general, by the elector-palatine; and Hel|mond is the property of the hou&s;e of Aremberg. In the &s;ame di&s;trict is al&s;o a lord&s;hip belonging to the Teutonic order, and two rich convents, which, by the indulgence of the &s;tates, are &s;uffered to re|main and enjoy their ancient revenues.</P>
<P>Breda, &s;ituate at the conflux of the Merk and the Aa, which, after their junction, are naviga|ble from hence to the German ocean, fourteen miles from Dort to the &s;outh, twenty from Bois le Duc to the we&s;t, and twenty-five from Antwerp to the north-ea&s;t. It is pretty well built and forti|fied, and a part of the adjacent country may be laid under water. Here are &s;everal &s;quares, one of which is delightfully planted with trees, a moated ca&s;tle, and &s;everal churches; but the trade and manufactures of the town are greatly declined. The &s;tates have been po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of it ever &s;ince the year 1637. Here king Charles II. re&s;ided a &s;hort time before he &s;et out, when invited by his &s;ub|jects to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his kingdoms, and from hence was dated his famous declaration. Here al&s;o, in 1669, the famous treaty of peace was concluded between the &s;aid king Charles, Lewis XIV. of France, and the &s;tates-general, under the media|tion of the king of Sweden. The neighbourhood
<PB N="26" REF="250">
of the town is very plea&s;ant; among other agreea|ble objects, are &s;everal woods, of which one is cut out into beautiful walks and vi&s;tas. The town gives name to a barony, and both belong to the prince of Orange, under the &s;overeignty of the &s;tates. In the barony are eighteen country towns and villages, of which the principal are William|&s;tadt and Steenbergen, both well fortified, and garri&s;oned by the &s;tates-general, as well as Breda.</P>
<P>Bergen-op-Zoom, a very &s;trong fortre&s;s, which, by the rivulet or canal of Zoom, has a communi|cation with the ea&s;tern Scheld, &s;tanding nineteen miles from Antwerp, &s;eventeen from Breda, and twenty-&s;ix from Middleburg in Zealand. All the pa&s;&s;es to it are guarded by forts, lines, redoubts, and batteries; be&s;ides the adjacent country may be laid under water, and &s;upplies of men, provi&s;ions, and ammunition thrown into it from Zealand, by means of the Scheld, which the be&s;iegers cannot prevent, till they are ma&s;ters of all the forts upon that river. It belongs, together with the marqui|&s;ate to which it gives name, to the elector-pala|tine, under the &s;overeignty of the &s;tates-general, who always keep a good garri&s;on in the town. In 1747 the French made them&s;elves ma&s;ters of it by &s;urprize, as was &s;aid, but by treachery, as was &s;u&s;pected, after a &s;iege of ten weeks. In 1749, however, it was re&s;tored, though in a very ruinous condition. It contains about eleven hundred hou&s;es, and has a good harbour, defended on both &s;ides by &s;trong forts. On the Scheld, in this mar|qui&s;ate, are al&s;o the &s;trong forts of Lillo, Krui&s;&s;|chanz, and Frederic-Henry.</P>

<HEAD>In that part of FLANDERS belonging to the STATES are the following places worth mentioning, viz.</HEAD>
<P>Sluys, &s;urnamed in Flanders, and in French called L'Eclu&s;e, &s;ituated on an arm of the German ocean; but of late the harbour hath been &s;o choaked up with &s;and, that it admits only &s;mall ve&s;&s;els. Its forti|fications, natural and artificial, are very &s;trong, and nothing but a &s;uperior force at &s;ea can prevent its receiving &s;upplies from thence; the air, how|ever, is &s;o bad, that the garri&s;on mu&s;t be changed every year. All the other Dutch governors in
<PB N="29" REF="280">
Flanders are &s;ubordinate to the governor of Sluys. Charles VI. king of France, in 1386, fitted out in this harbour a very formidable fleet again&s;t the Eng|li&s;h, con&s;i&s;ting of nine hundred &s;hips of war, furni&s;hed with an infinite number of machines, and a wooden town, which could ea&s;ily be taken to pieces, and put together again, for &s;heltering the &s;oldiers on their de&s;cent: but this prodigious armament was di&s;per&s;ed by a violent &s;torm.</P>
<P>Aardenborg, and Oe&s;tberg, two &s;mall towns on canals, that communicate with that arm of the &s;ea on which Sluys &s;tands, and which is called the Zwin.</P>
<P>Y&s;endyk, a &s;mall but well fortified town on the Blik-water, which is a bay formed by the We&s;t Scheld.</P>
<P>Biervliet, a &s;mall town on the We&s;t-Scheld. William Beukel&s;zoon, who fir&s;t taught the Dutch how to gut and cure herrings, was a native of this town.</P>
<P>Hul&s;t, a &s;trong fortified town, &s;ituated in a fruitful plain, which may be laid under water. The commodity it chiefly deals in is corn, having a ca|nal, or harbour, which communicates with the We&s;t-Scheld. The forts and lines by which it is &s;urrounded, render the approaches to it very diffi|cult; but the air is none of the be&s;t, and mo&s;t of the inhabitants are papi&s;ts. It gives name to a bailiage, which is of con&s;iderable extent.</P>
<P>Axel, a &s;mall, but &s;trong town, in an i&s;land &s;ormed by the We&s;t-Scheld.</P>
<P>Sas van Ghent, a &s;mall, but &s;trong town, on a bay of the We&s;t-Scheld. Its name &s;ignifies the &s;luice of Ghent; for the inhabitants having dug a canal from hence to that city, erected a &s;luice here for keeping up the waters. About a mile from the town is a fort called St. Antony's, which was built for the defence of the &s;luice.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="290">
Philippine, a &s;mall but well fortified town, on the we&s;tern arm of the Scheld, called Brackman|water. It had its name from Philip II. king of Spain, who cau&s;ed it to be built.</P>
<P>Fort St. Donnas, not far from Sluys.</P>
<P>In this part of Flanders is the i&s;land of Kad&s;and, or Cat&s;and, which, as well as many other places who&s;e names begin with Cat, is &s;uppo&s;ed to have been &s;o called from the Catti, who formerly inha|bited part of the Netherlands. It lies over-again&s;t Sluys, and is very fertile. To defend it again&s;t the &s;ea, to which it is much expo&s;ed in &s;tormy weather, &s;trong dykes have been erected, and are kept in repair at a va&s;t expence.</P>
<P>We &s;hall give an account of the barrier towns, viz. Namur, Tournay, Manen, Furnes, Warndon, Den|dermonde, Ruremonde, and Fort Knoque, in our de&s;cription of the Au&s;trian Netherlands, only ob|&s;erving here, that they are all garri&s;oned by the &s;tates, except Dendermonde and Ruremonde; of the for|mer of which one half of the garri&s;on con&s;i&s;ts of Dutchmen, and the other of Imperiali&s;ts; but that Ruremonde is entirely Au&s;trian. Of the Dutch garri&s;ons, the &s;tates nominate the governors, and other officers, but they mu&s;t take an oath to maintain the towns for the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria.

<P>THE Au&s;trian Netherlands con&s;i&s;t of the greate&s;t part of the duchies of Brabant, Lim|burg, and Luxemburg, with a part of that of Gueldres, and of the counties of Flanders, Hen|negau, and Namur. The Netherlands formerly made a part of the circle of Burgundy, the whole of which once belonged to the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria, and on the death of Charles V. devolved to the Burgundian Spani&s;h line of that hou&s;e, but was all afterwards lo&s;t, except the abovementioned coun|tries, which, on the death of Charles II. king of Spain, fell to the German line of the Au&s;trian fa|mily. The&s;e Au&s;trian Netherlands are &s;till con|&s;idered as a circle of the empire, of which the arch|ducal hou&s;e, as being &s;overeign of the whole, is the &s;ole director, and &s;ummoning prince. This circle contributes its &s;hare to the impo&s;ts of the empire, and &s;ends an envoy to the diet, but is not &s;ubject to the judicatories of the empire. It is wholly catho|lic, and under a governor-general appointed by the court of Vienna, who, at pre&s;ent, is his &s;erene high|ne&s;s prince Charles of Lorrain, brother to the late, and uncle to the pre&s;ent emperor.</P>
<P>We now proceed to a more particular di&s;cription of the &s;everal countries mentioned above.</P>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>BRABANT.</HEAD>
<P>Brabant is bounded to the ea&s;t by the bi&s;hopric of Liege; to the we&s;t by Flanders and Seeland, or Zealand; to the &s;outh by Hennegau and Na|mur; and to the north and ea&s;t by that part of Brabant which belongs to the United-Provinces. The air of this country is good, and the &s;oil fruit|ful,
<PB N="32" REF="310">
e&s;pecially in flex. It is watered by &s;everal rivers, the chief of which is the Demer, or Rupel. There are two fine canals in it, one of which joins the Senne and the Rupel, and co&s;t eight hundred thou&s;and florins; the other runs from Louvain to the Rupel. Between Louvain and Bru&s;&s;els is a fine &s;tone cau&s;eway, and another reaching from Lou|vain to Thienen and Leige. The &s;outhern part, called Walloon-Brabant, is mountainous, but not unfruitful. In Au&s;trian-Brabant are reckoned nineteen walled towns, be&s;ides a great many bo|roughs and villages. The &s;tates of the province con&s;i&s;t of the clergy, nobility, and repre&s;entatives of the chief towns. The&s;e &s;tates meet four times a year at Bru&s;&s;els. In them, and the viceroy, the legi&s;lative power, and that of levying money, is ve&s;ted, but the whole a&s;&s;embly mu&s;t be unanimous in pa&s;&s;ing an act. They appoint a kind of com|mittee, of two clergymen and two noblemen, to meet daily during their rece&s;s. There are four he|reditary officers of &s;tate for this province, viz. the &s;ene&s;chal, the chamberlain, the mar&s;hal, and the gui|don: be&s;ides which, there al&s;o is a great hunt&s;man, a great falconer, a great fore&s;ter, a chief ju&s;tice in eyre, and a ma&s;ter of the wolf-hunters. The high council of Brabant, which is divided into two cham|bers, or courts, and judges, in the la&s;t re&s;ort all the cau&s;es of the provinces, is held at Mechlin. The Roman catholic is the only religion of this country; and the number and opulence of the ec|cle&s;ia&s;tics is very great. At Mechlin is the &s;ee of an archbi&s;hop, to whom are &s;ubject the prelates of Antwerp, Ghent, Boi&s;leduc, Bruges, Ipres, and Ruremond. In the archbi&s;hopric are fourreen col|legiate churches, and two hundred and three cloi&s;|ters. This, with many other countries, came to the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria by the marriage of Maria, daughter of Charles the Bold, duke of Burgundy,
<PB N="33" REF="320">
with Maximilian, archduke of Au&s;tria. For the education of youth, and advancement of learning, here are &s;everal &s;chools and gymna&s;ia, be&s;ides the univer&s;ity of Louvain. The principal manufac|tures both of this and the other provinces of the Netherlands, con&s;i&s;t of fine lawns, cambrics, lace, and tape&s;try, with which they carry on a very ad|vantageous traffic. The arms of this duchy are a lion, or, in a fleld, &s;able. As to the character of Brabanders, and other Flemings, tho&s;e of the Au|&s;trian and Dutch Netherlands very much re&s;emble, both in their manners and per&s;ons, the Germans and Dutch; as tho&s;e of the French endeavour to imi|tate that nation. The language called the Walloon, which is generally &s;poken here, and in the other provinces, by the common people, is a dialect of the German, with a mixture of French and Spani&s;h; but the French language is under&s;tood and &s;poken by per&s;ons of rank all over the Netherlands, and al&s;o by many of the common &s;ort, e&s;pecially in French Flanders. Tho&s;e on the frontiers of Hol|land &s;peak Dutch.</P>

<DIV3>
<HEAD>Au&s;trian Brabant is divided into &s;everal quarters. In that of LOUVAIN the principal places are,</HEAD>
<P>Louvain, in Latin, Louvanium and Lovania, &s;ituated on the Dyle, thirteen miles from Bru&s;&s;els towards the ea&s;t. It claims the title of capital of Brabant, which, however, Bru&s;&s;els now enjoys, be|ing the &s;eat of the governor-general, and of all the courts of ju&s;tice. Louvain is very antient, having had its ri&s;e from a ca&s;tle built by the emperor Arnulphus, to &s;ecure the country again&s;t the in|roads of the Normans. That ca&s;tle was afterwards long the re&s;idence of the dukes of Brabant, and in it the emperor Charles V. and his &s;i&s;ters, were educated. Many a&s;&s;emblies of the &s;tates al&s;o have
<PB N="34" REF="330">
been kept in it. The churches and cloi&s;ters are very numerous and fine, both within and without the town, which is very large, but not populous; for there are many meadows, vineyards, gardens, and orchards, within the walls. The &s;tadthou&s;e and the church of St. Peter, are very beautiful. In the beginning of the fourteenth century the manufacture of woollen cloths was &s;o great here, that there were above four thou&s;and woollen-dra|pers, and above one hundred and fifty thou&s;and weavers in the city: when they went home from their work, a great beil was rung to give notice to the mothers to keep their children within doors, le&s;t they &s;hould be trampled under feet by that crowd of workmen; but in 1380 the journeymen weavers, and other trade&s;men, revolted, took up arms, threw &s;eventeen of their magi&s;trates out of the windows of the town-hou&s;e, and laid wa&s;te all Brabant: at la&s;t, however, they were &s;ub|dued, &s;ome of their ringleaders executed, and mo&s;t of the others bani&s;hed. Of the&s;e, many re|tired to England, and were kindly received. The trade of Louvain hath ever &s;ince been upon the decline, and at pre&s;ent is incon&s;iderable, con&s;i&s;ting chiefly in the excellent beer which is brewed there, of which a great quantity is &s;ent to the neighbour|ing cities, e&s;pecially to Bru&s;&s;els. With a view to re&s;tore this city to its former lu&s;tre, an univer&s;ity was founded in it in 1426, by John IV. duke of Brabant, which enjoys great privileges, granted to it both by the popes and dukes. There are above forty colleges; and in the hall, where the public exerci&s;es are performed, are three &s;pacious rooms, where lectures are read every morning in divinity, law, and phy&s;ic, to which the &s;cholars, in every college, may re&s;ort. The Hol|landers have a college here for their Roman catho|lics: the Engli&s;h, one of Augu&s;tine monks: and
<PB N="35" REF="340">
the Iri&s;h one of Dominicans, and another of Re|collects. Nothing, however, is more certain, than that true philo&s;ophy and divinity are little known or valued here; which will always be the ca&s;e, wherever colleges are in the hands of monks and eccle&s;ia&s;tics, tho&s;e e&s;pecially of the church of Rome. In order to make the &s;ciences flouri&s;h, and to encourage the learned, pope Sixtus IV. granted to the univer&s;ity in 1483, the privilege of pre&s;enting to all the livings in the Netherlands; by virtue of which privilege, the profe&s;&s;ors and &s;tu|dents of Louvain are &s;till intitled to all the pre|bends and rectories of this country. The church belonging to the Je&s;uits convent, would pa&s;s for a beauty even in Rome, and the pulpit of oak is the fine&s;t piece of that kind in the world. A|mong the nunneries, the convent for the Engli&s;h is the fine&s;t in the Low-Countries, and very richly endowed. This city boa&s;ts that it was never taken by force of arms: in 1710, indeed, the French entered it, but it was by &s;urprize; and they were &s;o roughly handled by the inhabitants, that they were obliged to retire in di&s;order. To reward their bravery, Charles, then &s;tiled king of Spain, and afterwards emperor, &s;ent them a golden key, which is &s;till kept in the town-hou&s;e. However, in 1746, the French not only made them&s;elves ma&s;ters of the town, but kept it till 1749.</P>
<P>Park, an abbey of Praemon&s;traten&s;es, and one of the fine&s;t in the Netherlands.</P>
<P>Tienen, in Latin, Thenae, or Thenae in Mon|tibus, in French, Tillemont, and al&s;o Tirlemont, &s;even miles from Louvain towards the ea&s;t, on the river Ghete. This was once one of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable cities in Brabant, but is now in a de|clining &s;tate. There are two collegiate churches in it: the canons of one of them may marry; but if they become widowers, they are not allowed to
<PB N="36" REF="350">
wed again, unle&s;s they re&s;ign their prebends. No man has yet been able to know what their year|ly income amounts to; it &s;eems they take an oath never to reveal it. They mu&s;t be all natives of Tirlemont, and the prebends are all in their own gift. Here are al&s;o &s;ix mona&s;teries, and eight nunneries.</P>
<P>Heverle, a &s;mall town near Louvain, with a fine ca&s;tle, belonging to the duke of Aremberg and Ar&s;chot, who is lord of this manor, and here|ditary chamberlain of Brabant.</P>
<P>Limale, or Li&s;male, a fine borough in Walloon Brabant.</P>
<P>Gemblours, a &s;mall town, &s;ix miles from Na|mur, belonging to the Benedictine abbey here. It is famous for the celebrated monk Sigebertus, author of the Chronicon Gimblacen&s;e, well known to the learned; and for a victory obtained by don John of Au&s;tria over the army of the &s;tates-gene|ral, commanded by Anthony de Coignies. In the abbey king William took up his head-quarters, during a great part of his wars with France: this abbey is an exempt, and the abbot is &s;tiled count of Gemblours, and reckoned the fir&s;t of that rank of Brabant.</P>
<P>Ramillies, a village, near eleven miles from Namur, where, in the year 1706, the duke of Marlborough gained a great victory over the French.</P>
<P>Leeuwe, a &s;mall but &s;trong town on the river Ghete, &s;even miles from Tirlemont, &s;ituated in a mar&s;hy ground, that renders it almo&s;t inacce&s;&s;ible; but the air is &s;o bad, that the &s;overeigns of the country u&s;ed formerly to bani&s;h hither tho&s;e they had a mind to puni&s;h, and &s;uch as are not u&s;ed to it cannot live long in it, without falling &s;ick.</P>
<P>Landen, a little decayed town, &s;even miles from Tirlemont, but famous for the bloody battle fought
<PB N="37" REF="360">
near it, in 1693, between the French, command|ed by the dukes of Luxemberg, Villeroy, and Berwick, and the confederates, under the command of king William and the elector of Bavaria, in which the French got the day.</P>
<P>Die&s;t, a &s;mall town on the Demer, thirteen miles from Louvain, formerly noted for its woollen ma|nufactures, which are now much declined. It has a great fair for hor&s;es every A&s;h Wedne&s;day. In the year 1490 it devolved to the hou&s;e of Na&s;&s;au, and belongs at pre&s;ent to the hereditary &s;tadtholder of the United-Provinces.</P>
<P>Sichen, an antient little town on the Demer, near Die&s;t, which, with its territory, belongs al&s;o to the &s;tadtholder of the United-Provinces.</P>
<P>Scherpen-heuvel, in French Montaigu, in Latin Monacutus, or A&s;pricollis, &s;o called from its &s;itu|ation on the top of an hill, is a &s;mall, but regu|larly built town, in the form of a heptagon, not far from Die&s;t.</P>
<P>Ar&s;chot, a &s;mall but well fortified town on the Demer, &s;even miles from Louvain, and the capi|tal of a duchy, belonging to the duke of Arem|berg, who, from thence, is al&s;o &s;tiled duke of Ar&s;chot.</P>

<HEAD>In the Quarter or Territory of BRUSSELS, the prin|cipal places are,</HEAD>
<P>Bru&s;&s;els, which gives name to the territory, and is the capital not only of Brabant but of the Ne|therlands, tho' only the &s;econd in rank. It &s;tands on the little river Senne, on the brow of a hill, thirteen miles from Louvain to the we&s;t. No city in Europe makes a finer figure at a di&s;tance, except Naples and Genoa; but, like them, it falls &s;hort of one's expectation when it is entered, being all up hill and down. The city is about &s;even miles in
<PB N="38" REF="370">
circumference, and con&s;equently too large to hold out a long &s;iege, has &s;even gates, with large &s;uburbs, and is encompa&s;&s;ed with a double brick|wall and ditches. It is very populous and well built, and has &s;even &s;quares, all very fine, particu|larly the great &s;quare or market-place, which is, perhaps, the fine&s;t in Europe. Around it are the halls of the different trades, the fronts of which are adorned with &s;culpture and gilding, and Latin in&s;criptions; one quarter being entirely taken up by the town-hou&s;e, a noble pile of building, in which are the apartments where the &s;tates of Bra|bant meet, finely adorned with tape&s;try in gilt frames, and original paintings. On the top of the &s;teeple, which is three hundred and &s;ixty-four feet high, is the &s;tatue of St. Michael killing the dra|gon, of gilt copper, &s;eventeen foot high, which &s;erves for a weather-cock. The public buildings in general, particularly the palaces and courts of the &s;everal princes, counts, and other per&s;ons of di&s;tinction, together with the churches and cloi&s;ters, are large and magnificent. Behind the imperial palace, that &s;tood in the highe&s;t part of the city, but was burnt down not many years ago, is a park, well &s;tocked with deer, and planted with trees like that of St. James's at London, for the inhabitants to walk in. At the farther end of it is a fine plea|&s;ure-hou&s;e, built by the emperor Charles V. after his abdication. Of the other palaces, tho&s;e of the prince de la Tour and Taxis, and of the Engli&s;h earl of Aile&s;bury are very fine; and of the gardens, tho&s;e of the duke of Bournonville, are the mo&s;t delightful. In all the palaces are collections of ori|ginal paintings by the mo&s;t eminent ma&s;ters, both Italian and Flemi&s;h. The ar&s;enal is well worth &s;eeing on account of the curious antique arms. The opera-hou&s;e, which is certainly the noble&s;t and large&s;t in Europe, is built after the Italian
<PB N="39" REF="380">
manner, with rows of lodges or clo&s;ets, in mo&s;t of which are chimneys. The lodge belonging to the prince de Ligne is hung with looking gla&s;&s;es, in which, while he &s;its by the fire and drinks a bottle, or eats a &s;upper, he may &s;ee the whole repre&s;enta|tion, without being &s;een by the actors or company. Four fine pictures of the markets of Bru&s;&s;els by Rubens and Synder, which co&s;t the dukes of St. Pierre forty thou&s;and florins, and for which the French king, Lewis XIV. offered great &s;ums, are now in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the earl of Orford. This city is extremely well provided with water, having twenty public fountains, adorned with &s;tatues at the corners of the mo&s;t public &s;treets. The lower part of the city is called the Rivage, and is cut in|to canals, which communicate with the great canal, extending from Bru&s;&s;els to the Scheld, fifteen miles. By this canal, which was fini&s;hed in 1361, and co&s;t the city eight hundred thou&s;and florins, a per&s;on may &s;ail from Bru&s;&s;els to the North Sea; and large covered boats called treck-&s;chuyts actually go twice a day to Antwerp and back again. Each boat is drawn by one hor&s;e only, which goes a gentle pace at the rate of three miles an hour, and the fare is about two-pence farthing for every hour. Along the canals, both within and without the city, are fine walks planted with trees, as in Holland, and al&s;o on the walls. Of the churches the mo&s;t remarkable is that of St. Gudula, which is an old Gothic building on the out&s;ide, but finely adorned within. In the choir are &s;everal fine monuments of illu&s;trious princes, and all around it are a great many pretty chapels, in one of which they wor&s;hip three ho&s;ties, which, they &s;ay, were &s;tabbed in the year 1369, by a Jew, and bled. The&s;e are expo&s;ed every fe&s;tival, in a chalice, richly &s;et with diamonds, and on the Sunday after the 13th of July, there is a yearly proce&s;&s;ion in memory of this &s;tabbing,
<PB N="40" REF="390">
when the ho&s;ties are carried round the city, embel|li&s;hed with all manner of precious &s;tones, and at|tended by all the clergy, &s;ecular and regular, the magi&s;trates, the courts of ju&s;tice, and even by the governor of the province. The chapel where they are kept, is all of marble, and the altar of &s;olid &s;ilver. Among the cloi&s;ters of all orders here, there are two Engli&s;h; the one of Dominican la|dies, founded by cardinal Howard in the reign of Charles II. of which a lady of the hou&s;e of Norfolk is always abbe&s;s; the other is of Benedictine nuns. The beguinage here is like a little town, &s;urrounded with a wall and ditch, and divided into pretty lit|tle &s;treets, where every beguine has her apartment. The number of them generally amounts to &s;even or eight hundred, and &s;ometimes more; they are governed by four matrons, whom they chu&s;e out of their own body, and have a confe&s;&s;or appointed by the bi&s;hop of Antwerp, and a very fine church. Here, and in all other great towns of the Nether|lands, is a public office for lending money, at a mo|derate intere&s;t, upon pledges: it is called the Mount of Piety, and was e&s;tabli&s;hed by the arch|duke Albert, and I&s;abella his wife, in 1617: there are private pa&s;&s;ages for going in, without being &s;een from the public &s;treets. This city is noted for &s;even grand &s;treets, &s;even pari&s;h churches, &s;even patrician families, out of which the magi&s;tracy is elected, &s;even large &s;quares, &s;even midwives, li|cenced and &s;worn by the &s;enate, and &s;even gates, each leading to different places of recreation and exerci&s;e; viz. one to a place proper for fowling, an|other to one for fi&s;hing, a third to one for hunting, a fourth to plea&s;ant fields, a fifth to pa&s;ture-grounds, a &s;ixth to &s;prings and vineyards, and a &s;eventh to gardens. Bru&s;&s;els is &s;aid to have entertained, at one time, &s;even crowned heads, be&s;ides the dukes of Savoy and Lorrain, with nine thou&s;and hor&s;e be|longing
<PB N="41" REF="400">
to their retinues. The inns, or eating|hou&s;es here, are equal to any in the world: a &s;tranger may dine any time betwixt twelve, and three, on &s;even or eight di&s;hes of meat, for le&s;s than a &s;hilling Engli&s;h. The wines al&s;o are very good and cheap; and for &s;ix-pence Engli&s;h, by the hour, you may have a coach to carry you wherever you plea&s;e. At the gate of Bru&s;&s;els be|gins the famous wood of Sogne, of great extent, out of which the inhabitants are allowed to cut a great quantity of wood for fuel every year, and as fa&s;t as the trees are cut down, fre&s;h ones are planted in their room, by which means the fore&s;t will continue for ever for the benefit of the poor. This city is the &s;eat of the council of &s;tate, the privy-council, the council of finances, the war-council, and the chamber of accompts of the chancery and foedal court of Brabant, the court of the grand fore&s;ter, and a particular chamber of accompts for the pro|vince of Brabant. The trade of this city con&s;i&s;ts in camblets, laces, and tape&s;tries manufactured here, and &s;ent all over Europe.

This city, &s;tiled by the natives Anwerpen, by the French Anvers, by the Spaniards Amberes, and in Latin Antverpia, and Andoverpum, lies in a low mar&s;hy ground on the Scheld, twenty-five miles from

Bru&s;&s;els to the north. It is the third city in rank in Brabant, large and well-built, containing twenty-two &s;quares, and above two hundred &s;treets, all &s;traight and broad, e&s;pecially that called the Mere, in which &s;ix coaches can go a-brea&s;t. Mo&s;t of the hou&s;es are of free &s;tone, and have an air of antiquity, being high, with courts before and gar|dens behind. At the head of the Mere is a cruci|fix of bra&s;s thirty-three feet high. The cathedral dedicated to our Lady, the &s;tadt-hou&s;e, and the exchange, are magnificent &s;tructures: the latter is the fir&s;t building of that kind in Europe, and on its model the exchanges of London and Am|&s;terdam are built: its pillars are all of blue mar|ble, and carved, but all in a different manner. The exchange co&s;t the city three hundred thou&s;and crowns. Antwerp, towards the end of the fifteenth century, was one of the mo&s;t celebrated towns that ever exi&s;ted. The Scheld, on which it &s;tands, being twenty feet deep at low-water, and ri&s;ing twenty feet more at flood, &s;hips of the greate&s;t burden came up to the keys, as in the river Thames at London; but when the United-Pro|vinces formed them&s;elves into a free &s;tate, after having &s;haken off the yoke of Spain, they got the entire command of the navigation of the Scheld, which ruined the trade of Antwerp, and tran&s;|ferred it to Am&s;terdam: this made the inhabi|tants turn their heads to painting, jewelling, and banking, which they have continued to this day, with great &s;ucce&s;s and reputation; for at Antwerp bills of exchange may be negociated for any &s;um to any part of Europe; and in the war before the la&s;t, two brothers of the name of de Koning, paid the one the army of France, and the other that of the confederates. Be&s;ides, here is a fine manufac|ture of tape&s;try and lace; and, for the promoting of trade, an in&s;urance-company has been erected.

This city is the &s;ee of a bi&s;hop, who, as abbot of St. Bernard, is the &s;econd prelate in Brabant. The bi&s;hopric is of great extent, and the cathedral a mo&s;t noble pile, with one of the fine&s;t &s;teeples in the world. The emperor Charles V. when he made his entry into Antwerp, &s;aid it ought to be put in a ca&s;e, and &s;hewed only once a-year for a rarity. The hou&s;e of the han&s;e-towns, built when the city was in its flouri&s;hing condition, is a &s;tately build|ing, with magazines above for dry goods, and cellars below for wet, and, in the middle, &s;to|ry were three hundred lodging rooms for mer|chants; but now it is turned to a hor&s;e bar|rack. There is a market here called the Fri|day's market, becau&s;e it is held every Friday, where all &s;orts of hou&s;hold-goods, pictures, and jewels, are &s;old by auction. No city in the Ne|therlands has &s;o many and &s;o fine churches as this. Many of them, particularly the cathedral and Je&s;uit's church, are adorned with paintings, by Sir Peter Paul Rubens, who was a native of this city; and by Quintin Ma&s;&s;eys, who is &s;aid to have been a black&s;mith, but that having fallen in love with a painter's daughter, and been told by her fa|ther, when he a&s;ked her of him in marriage, that he would have none but a painter for his &s;on-in-law, he went to Italy to &s;tudy painting, and, in a few years, returned &s;o eminent in his new profe&s;&s;ion, that he found no difficulty in obtaining the father's con&s;ent. He is interred at the entry of the cathe|dral, where his effigy is put up, with an in&s;cription &s;ignifying, that conjugal love made an Apelles of a black&s;mith. The above-mentioned Je&s;uits church is extremely magnificent, and the chapel of the Virgin, joining to it, &s;till more &s;o. Among the cloi&s;ters the mo&s;t remarkable are, the noble and rich abbey of St. Michael, on the banks of the Scheld, the apartments of which are truly royal,

As to the fortifications of the city, it is environed with a fine wall, planted with rows of trees on each &s;ide, with walks between, broad enough for two coaches to go a-brea&s;t, being al&s;o defended by a very &s;trong, large, regular citadel, in form of a pentagon, erected by the duke of Al|va, in 1568, which commands the town, and the neighbouring country. The magi&s;tracy of this city is cho&s;en only out of the &s;even patrician fami|lies, and con&s;i&s;ts of two burgoma&s;ters, and eighteen echevins, be&s;ides inferior magi&s;trates. Among the privileges granted to it by its princes, there is one by which every per&s;on born in it is a citizen, tho' both his father and mother were foreigners. When the duke of Alen&ccedil;on, brother to the French king Henry III. whom the &s;tates-general had appointed governor of the Netherlands, made an attempt, in 1582, to &s;urprize this city, the citizens defended them&s;elves &s;o bravely, that they drove the French out of the town, killed fifteen hundred of them, of which three hundred were noblemen, and took two thou&s;and, with the lo&s;s of only eighty men: the duke, having by this &s;tep lo&s;t the confidence of the &s;tates, retired to France, where he &s;oon died of grief. The &s;iege which this city held out, in 1585, again&s;t the duke of Parma, governor of the Ne|therlands, is one of the mo&s;t renowned in hi&s;tory. The &s;iege la&s;ted a twelvemonth; and he never could have &s;ucceeded, had it not been for the &s;tu|pendous bridge he laid over the Scheld to carry on his attack.

It had formerly counts and dukes of its own, who were princes of great fame and power, and &s;everal of them were advanced to the dignity of emperors and kings. In the year 1444, Elizabeth, prince&s;s of this country, ceded all her right in it to Philip the Good, duke of Burgundy, for the capital &s;um of &s;ixteen thou&s;and florins, and an annual pen&s;ion of eight thou&s;and: afterwards it came to the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria, in the &s;ame manner as the other pro|vinces of the Netherlands.

<P>Geldre, a &s;mall, but very &s;trong town, which gives name to the whole province. It &s;tands in an i&s;land formed by the river Niers, and is &s;o well for|tified, that it is reckoned one of the &s;tronge&s;t cities of the Netherlands. The king of Pru&s;&s;ia had this town and territory, in lieu of the principality of Orange, to which he had a right, as heir to king William III. It is the re&s;idence of a governor, and college of ju&s;tice.</P>

<P>Wachtendonk, a &s;mall town, but well fortified both by nature and art, and the capital of a terri|tory. It &s;tands on the Niers. It is &s;aid that bombs were fir&s;t u&s;ed at the &s;iege of this town, in 1588.</P>

<HEAD>The Au&s;trian Part of the County of FLANDERS.</HEAD>
<P>This county is bounded to the ea&s;t by Brabant, and the Hennegau; to the north-we&s;t by the Northern-Sea; to the &s;outh-we&s;t by Artois; to the north by that branch, or arm of the Scheld, called the Hont, which parts it from Zealand; and to the &s;outh by the Hennegau and Artois. With regard to its extent, the greate&s;t length of the whole province is about &s;eventy-five miles, and the breadth fifty-five. The air is &s;aid to be clearer and finer the farther you remove from the &s;ea. The winters are often pretty long and &s;evere, and the &s;ummers wet, yet &s;ometimes very &s;ultry. The &s;oil in general is fertile, and, in &s;ome parts, to a very high degree. It yields excellent pa&s;turage, which in con&s;equence of great num|bers
<PB N="56" REF="550">
of black cattle, hor&s;es, and &s;heep, are bred in it, and large quantities of butter and chee&s;e made. It produces al&s;o all &s;orts of garden-&s;tuff, fruit, corn, and flax, e&s;pecially the la&s;t, exceeding fine, and in great plenty. In &s;ome places they have not corn &s;ufficient for the inhabitants, but in others there is a &s;uperfluity. The ewes here bring forth three lambs at a birth, and &s;ometimes four, five, and even &s;ix or &s;even. At a di&s;tance from the &s;ea there is a great deal of wood, proper either for timber or fuel. Towards the coa&s;t they find, at the depth of four or five feet, a kind of turf for burning. The province is well &s;upplied with &s;ea and river fi&s;h, fowl, and veni&s;on, but has no &s;late or free-&s;tone. It is &s;o exceeding populous, that it looks like one continued city. A great deal of ex|cellent beer is brewed in it. The principal rivers are the Scheld, the Lys, the Scarpe, and the Dender. There are al&s;o &s;everal canals, of which that between Bruges and Ghent is the chief. The &s;tates here con&s;i&s;t of the clergy, nobility, and commoners. The clergy are the bi&s;hops and abbots; the nobility, certain families po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of hereditary offices, or baronies, to which that pri|vilege is annexed; and the commoners, the burgoma&s;ters, pen&s;ionaries, and deputies of the cities and di&s;tricts. In the Au&s;trian and French parts of this province, the only religion profe&s;&s;ed or tolerated is the Roman catholic. With re&s;pect to the per&s;ons and character of the inhabitants, they are, generally &s;peaking, lu&s;ty, fat, and clum&s;y; very indu&s;trious, both in cultivating their lands, and in their trades and manufactures; lovers of liberty, and enemies to &s;lavery, and not defective in good &s;en&s;e and judgment, though they have not &s;o lively an imagination as &s;ome other nations. Their women are fair, hand&s;ome enough, and hone&s;t by their natural con&s;titution, as well as from a principle of virtue. As they cannot pretend to
<PB N="57" REF="560">
wit and repartee, they do not make them&s;elves ridi|culous by the nau&s;eous affectation of them. Both &s;exes are great lovers of public diver&s;ions, and every city, town, and village, have their kermi&s;&s;es, or fairs, in which all &s;orts of &s;hews are exhibited. In this country &s;ome important arts were invented and improved. Weaving in general was greatly improved, and that of figures of all &s;orts in linen invented: al&s;o that of curing herrings, of dying cloths and &s;tuffs, and of oil-colours. The manu|factures of this country are not in the flouri&s;hing &s;tate they were formerly; yet &s;ilk, cotton, and woollen &s;tuffs, brocades, camlets, tape&s;try, lace, and linen, are &s;till manufactured here in great quantities. This province had counts of its own from the ninth century to the year 1369, when it went, by marriage, to the dukes of Burgundy; and afterwards from them, by marriage al&s;o, to the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria. France, in 1667, &s;eized the &s;outhern part, and the &s;tates-general obtained the northern, partly by the treaty of Mun&s;ter, and partly by the barrier treaty of 1715. The arms of Flanders are a lion, &s;able, in a field, or. The chief court of judicature is the provincial council at Ghent, from which an appeal lies to the &s;upreme council at Mechlin. There is al&s;o at Ghent a tri|bunal, which decides in all matters relating to fiefs. In our more particular account of this country, we &s;hall confine our&s;elves at pre&s;ent to what be|longs to the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria, having already de&s;cribed that which belongs to the United-Pro|vinces, and re&s;erving the French part till we come to France.</P>

<HEAD>In the Au&s;trian part of the Province the mo&s;t con|&s;iderable places are,</HEAD>
<P>Ghent, the capital of Flanders, and one of the large&s;t cities in Europe, being &s;even miles in com|pa&s;s

within the walls, but the half of that &s;pace is not built upon. It &s;tands thirty miles from Tour|nay, twenty-eight from Bru&s;&s;els, twenty-&s;ix from Antwerp, and thirty-three from O&s;tend, and is di|vided by rivers and canals into twenty-&s;ix i&s;lands, which are again united by about a hundred bridges, great and &s;mall. The city is well fortified both by art and nature, as it has a &s;trong ca&s;tle, walls, and ditches, and can, by &s;hutting up the &s;luices, lay the country a mile round under water. It was &s;o powerful and populous formerly, that it declared war, more than once, again&s;t its &s;overeign, and rai&s;ed mighty armies. The emperor Charles V. was born here in 1500. From the tower of Bel|fort, in the middle of the town, there is a delight|ful pro&s;pect all over it. It is the &s;ee of a bi&s;hop, &s;uffragan to the archbi&s;hop of Mechlin. Its fir&s;t bi&s;hop was the celebrated Jan&s;enius, from whom the Jan&s;eni&s;ts take their name. Here are a great number of mona&s;teries, churches, ho&s;pitals, and market-places. Of the la&s;t, that called the Friday's market is the large&s;t, and is adorned with a &s;tatue of Charles V. in his imperial robes. The &s;tadt|hou&s;e and cathedral are grand &s;tructures; under the latter is a noble crypta, or &s;ubterraneous church. Here are fifty companies of trade&s;men, and very curious manufactures of cloths, &s;tuffs, and &s;ilks. The chief magi&s;trate is the high-bailiff, under whom are burgoma&s;ters, echevins, and coun|&s;ellors. Here are &s;everal canals, of which that which leads to Bruges, and from thence to O&s;tend, is a very noble one.</P>
<P>Alo&s;t, or as the Flemings &s;pell it, Ael&s;t, on the Dender, between Bru&s;&s;els and Ghent, the capital of that called Imperial Flanders. Here are &s;e|veral convents of friers and nuns, and a college of Je&s;uits. In the convent of the Gulielmite monks is the tomb of Thierry Martin, who fir&s;t brought

the art of printing hither from Germany, with an epitaph, written by his friend Era&s;mus. The ter|ritory of this city is of a pretty large extent, and is called a county, having antiently had counts of its own. It is very fruitful in pa&s;ture, corn, flax, and hops.</P>

<P>Oudenarde, or Audenaerde, a &s;mall town parted into two, and wholly &s;urrounded by the Schelde. It lies fifteen miles from Ghent towards the &s;outh, and twenty-eight from Bru&s;&s;els to the we&s;t. It is noted for the beautiful tape&s;tries wove in it, in which it has a good trade. There are &s;everal con|vents in it, and it is partly under the juri&s;diction of the magi&s;trates, and partly under that of the baron of Pamele, who has a very antient ca&s;tle in the town. Here Margaret, natural daughter of the emperor Charles V. duche&s;s of Parma, and go|verne&s;s of the Netherlands, was born in 1521: but what will render it for ever famous, is the great victory obtained by the duke of Marlborough and prince Eugene over the French, commanded by the duke of Burgundy, grand-father to the pre&s;ent king of France, and by the duke of Vendome, on the 11th of June, 1708. In this battle king George II. of Great-Britain di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf. Of the French above four thou&s;and were left dead upon the &s;pot, and above eight thou&s;and taken pri&s;oners. The ca&s;tle ward of this town is of con|&s;iderable extent, containing &s;everal manors, and upwards of twenty villages, of which Vechte is
<PB N="60" REF="590">
one, who&s;e lord is hereditary mar&s;hal of Flanders. In the neighbourhood of the town are two noble abbeys.</P>
<P>Courtray, a &s;mall but agreeable city, &s;ituated on the Lys, which divides it into two. It is twenty-two miles from Bruges to the &s;outh, and twenty from Ghent to the &s;outh-we&s;t, to which la&s;t city a fine paved road leads from it. In the year 1744 the French made them&s;elves ma&s;ters of it, and &s;tripped it of its fortifications. Here are &s;e|veral religious hou&s;es, and &s;ome ho&s;pitals; but the city is chiefly noted for its manufactures of woollen cloths and table-linen, e&s;pecially that &s;ort we call diaper, and fine dama&s;k table-cloths and napkins. All kinds of figures and hi&s;tory are wo|ven here in a very ingenious manner, in linen. The ca&s;tleward of Courtray is very large, and extends on both &s;ides of the Lys, in a very fruitful country. It is divided into five quarters, four of which are denominated from the chief places in them, viz. Haerlebeecke, Thielt, Deyn&s;e, and Menin. The other is &s;tiled the verge, or quarter, of the thirteen pari&s;hes. Thielt has a good manufactory of linen, and Menin was one of the barrier-towns, which, in 1715, were ceded to the &s;tates-general, to have garri&s;ons put into them; but, in 1744, the French made them&s;elves ma&s;ters of it, and razed the for|tifications.</P>
<P>St. Nicholas, the capital of the county of Waes, abounds in corn and flax, and has its particular lows and cu&s;toms, and a court of ju&s;tice, having been formerly an independent county. This place is noted for its fairs, and trade in corn and flax. In the &s;ame county is al&s;o Rupelmonde, &s;o called from its &s;ituation at the conflux of the Rupel with the Schelde, where the celebrated geographer Ger|hard-Mercator was born.</P>
<P><PB N="61" REF="600">
Dendermonde, &s;o called from its being &s;ituated at the conflux of the Dender with the Schelde, Monde, in Flemi&s;h &s;ignifying a mouth. It &s;tands fourteen miles from Ghent to the ea&s;t, and &s;ixteen from Antwerp towards the &s;outh. It is very &s;trong both by art and nature; for the neighbouring country, which is very plea&s;ant and fruitful, may be ea&s;ily laid under water. It has al&s;o a &s;trong ci|tadel near the mouth of the Dender. The town is hand&s;ome and well built, and drives a pretty good trade. Among other privileges which its merchants enjoy, one is, that their creditors can|not force them to make any payment on Sundays, Mondays, or Tue&s;days. This city, with its ter|ritory, which contains &s;ixteen fine villages, is now governed by an high bailiff. Formerly it had lords of its own, who were independent of the earls of Flanders, and held immediately of the emperor.</P>
<P>Bornheim, the capital of a county, between Dendermonde and Rupelmonde. Here is a con|vent of Engli&s;h Dominican friers, founded in 1670 by the reverend father Thomas Howard, duke of Norfolk, who was of that &s;ame order, and was af|terwards created a cardinal.</P>
<P>Bruges, twenty-four miles from Ghent, eleven from O&s;tend, and forty-&s;ix from Antwerp. A chapel, which antiently &s;tood here near a bridge, in Flemi&s;h, Brugge, gave occa&s;ion to the build|ing of the city, and its name. Here are &s;everal fine canals. By one of them one can go to O&s;tend, Newport, Furnes, and Dunkirk, in a &s;ummer's day, and ve&s;&s;els of four hundred tons can come up into the ba&s;on of Bruges. There is another that leads to Ghent, another to Damme, and a third to Sluys. The water of the&s;e canals is &s;tagnant, without the lea&s;t motion, yet, by means of &s;luices within the city, may be renewed in half an hour: however, it is not u&s;ed for drinking or culinary purpo&s;es; but that
<PB N="62" REF="610">
which is brought by pipes from the Lys and Schelde, for which every hou&s;e pays a tax, as in London. This was antiently a mo&s;t flouri&s;hing city, in con&s;equence of its trade.</P>
<P>Here are &s;till &s;hewn &s;eventeen palaces, antiently the re&s;idences of the con&s;uls of different nations, each of which had di&s;tinct hou&s;es, magnificently built, with warehou&s;es for the merchandizes they exported or imported. One may judge of the power and wealth of the citizens in tho&s;e days, by their daring to keep their &s;overeign, the archduke Maximilian, pri&s;oner, to affront his &s;ervants, and abu&s;e his officers; but though the city has been long upon the decline, there are &s;till many rich merchants in it, who meet every day at noon in the great market-place. It is the &s;ee of a bi&s;hop, &s;uf|fragan to the archbi&s;hop of Mechlin, and heredi|tary-chancellor of Flanders. The dioce&s;e con|tains &s;ix cities, viz. Bruges, O&s;tend, Sluys, Damme, Middleburg in Flanders, and Oudenberch, be&s;ides one hundred and thirty-three boroughs or villages. The cathedral here is an antient building, erected in 865. Of the other churches, that dedicated to our Lady is very beautiful. Its &s;teeple is &s;o high that it is &s;een at &s;ea off O&s;tend. There are two tombs in it of gilt copper, the one of Mary, the heire&s;s of Burgundy, the other of her father Charles the Hardy, duke of Burgundy. Among other curio&s;ities in the trea&s;ure of this church, are the rich ve&s;tments of Thomas of Becket, arch|bi&s;hop of Canterbury, &s;et with diamonds and other precious &s;tones, and bought, at the Reforma|tion, by Mary, &s;i&s;ter to the emperor Charles V. and pre&s;ented to this church. Here are four abbies, and a va&s;t number of convents and nunneries. The church belonging to the Je&s;uits is of noble architecture. In that of the Dominicans is a very curious pulpit, the wood that &s;upports the top, be|ing
<PB N="63" REF="620">
cut out as ropes, and u&s;ed as &s;uch. There is al&s;o a very extraordinary picture of the marriage of our Saviour with St. Cath&agrave;rine of Sienna; the Virgin Mary joins their hands, St. Dominic mar|ries them, and old king David plays upon the harp at their wedding. The Carthu&s;ian mona&s;tery is very large, being about a mile in circumference. In the Carmelites church is a beautiful monument of Henry Jermyn, lord Dover, and peer of Eng|land: but the mona&s;tery called the Dunes, of the order of St. Bernard, is the noble&s;t in the city. The gardens and cloi&s;ters are very large and hand|&s;ome: the apartment of the abbot is magnificent, and tho&s;e of the monks neat; they keep a &s;umptuous table of every thing in &s;ea&s;on; have country-&s;eats where they go a hunting, or to refre&s;h them&s;elves; and they keep their own coaches. Among the nunneries, there are two Engli&s;h; one of Augu&s;|tines, who are all ladies of quality, and entertain &s;trangers at the grate with &s;weetmeats and wine. The other, called the Pelicans, is of a &s;tricter or|der and coar&s;er dre&s;s. Several courts are held here for the admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice; as that of the magi&s;trates for the city; that for the liberty of Bruges; that of the provo&s;t&s;hip and chapter, and the feodal court. In the chapel of St. Ba&s;il is pre&s;erved the blood, which Jo&s;eph of Arimathea wiped off with a &s;punge from the dead body of our Saviour. Fine woollen and cotton &s;tuffs, &s;ilks, tape&s;tries, linen, and lace, are made here. Many of the &s;treets and &s;quares are very fine; of the latter, the Fridays market-place, and the burg, are the mo&s;t remarkable. In this city, in January 1430, Philip the Good, duke of Burgundy, in&s;tituted the order of the Golden Fleece. The patrons or pro|tectors of the order, are the Virgin Mary and St. Andrew, and the habit, a robe of crim&s;on velvet, with a Golden Fleece hanging at a collar of gold.</P>

Ypres, on the little river Iperlee, the capital of a large di&s;trict, called the ca&s;tellany or ca&s;tle-ward of Ypres, which is a very fruitful country. It is a hand&s;ome town, and the &s;ee of a bi&s;hop, &s;uffragan of the archbi&s;hop of Mechlin. The convents and churches here are very numerous; and there are &s;ome ho&s;pitals, and manufactures of &s;ilk and wool. It is one of the barrier-towns that were ceded to the &s;tates-general in 1715.

It is well for|tified, and is &s;eated in a mar&s;hy ground, among di|vers canals, into &s;ome of which the large&s;t &s;hips may enter with the tide. The city is &s;urrounded with &s;everal forts, and the harbour is &s;uch that it can never be blocked up. Ships of great burthen may pa&s;s from hence to Bruges. This city held out again&s;t the Spaniards from July the 5th, 1601, to September the 22d, 1604. They are &s;aid to have lo&s;t eighty thou&s;and men before it; and the num|ber of tho&s;e who were killed or died in the city, was computed at fifty thou&s;and. It &s;urrendered, at la&s;t, on good terms; not for want of men or provi&s;ions, but purely for want of ground, which the enemy gained, foot by foot, till there was not enough left to hold men to defend it. Three hun|dred thou&s;and cannon ball, of thirty pound weight, are &s;aid to have been fired again&s;t it. The be|&s;ieged often repaired the breaches with heaps of dead bodies. The late emperor Charles VI. erect|ed an Ea&s;t-India company here; but the maritime powers, after many negociations, got it aboli&s;hed

The &s;trength of the town con&s;i&s;ts chiefly in its &s;luices, by which all the coun|try round can be laid under water in a moment. Here are &s;everal convents; one, in particular, of Engli&s;h Carthu&s;ian friars. In the neighbourhood a famous battle was fought, in 1600, betwixt the Spaniards, and the army of the &s;tates-general. It had the name of Newport from the harbour, built here in 1168. The inhabitants &s;upport them&s;elves chiefly by the fi&s;hing trade, and by making nets and cordage for &s;hipping. This town is al&s;o in the liberty of Bruges.</P>

<P>This county is bounded to the &s;outh by Cham|pagne and Picardy; to the north by Flanders; to the ea&s;t by the duchy of Brabant, the county of Namur, and the bi&s;hopric of Liege; and to the we&s;t by Artois and Flanders. Its extent from north to &s;outh is about forty-five miles, and about forty-eight from ea&s;t to we&s;t. The air of this county is plea&s;ant and temperate, and the &s;oil fruit|ful: it abounds in rich pa&s;tures, corn-fields, woods and fore&s;ts, coal, iron, lead, beautiful marble, &s;late, and other u&s;eful &s;tones: it is well watered by ri|vers and lakes, and breeds abundance of black cattle, and &s;heep, who&s;e wool is very fine. Its principal rivers are the Schelde, the Selle, and the Dender. This province is reckoned to contain twenty-four walled towns, nine hundred and fifty villages, one duchy, and &s;everal principalities, earldoms, peerdoms, and baronies. The abbeys in it are twenty-&s;even. For &s;piritual matters, the greater part of it is &s;ubject to the archbi&s;hop of Cambray, and the re&s;t to the bi&s;hops of Liege and Arras. The &s;tates of the province con&s;i&s;t of the clergy, nobility, and commoners. The clergy are the abbots, deputies of the chapters, and rural deans; but the chapters of St. Waudru and St. Germain, in Mons, &s;end no deputies, as they con|tribute nothing to the public taxes. The nobility con&s;i&s;t of the earls and barons, and all tho&s;e who, by their birth, have a right to a &s;eat in the a&s;|&s;embly of the &s;tates.

but there is a &s;tanding committee at Mons, which meets weekly. This county had long counts of its own, till the year 1436; when Philip the Good, duke of Burgundy, arrived to the po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion of it, upon the death of Jaquiline, the heire&s;s, without i&s;&s;ue. The French acquired that part of it which they po&s;&s;e&s;s, partly by the peace of the Py|renees, and partly by tho&s;e of Nimeguen and Re&s;|wyck. The arms of this county are quartered, and contain four lions, in a field, or.

Here is a famous chapter of canone&s;&s;es, founded by St. Waudru, &s;i&s;ter to the celebrated St. Aldegonide: they are in number thirteen, and mu&s;t prove their nobility by &s;ixteen de&s;cents: the &s;overeign has the nomination of them: they mu&s;t appear at morn|ing &s;ervice in their canonical habits; but the re&s;t of the day may wear the riche&s;t apparel, dance and &s;ing, or divert them&s;elves otherwi&s;e, as they plea&s;e; they may al&s;o, if they plea&s;e, leave the ab|bey, and marry: their church is very fine, all its chapels and altars being of marble and ja&s;per, and its &s;tatues of exqui&s;ite workman&s;hip. There is a manufacture here of woollen &s;tuffs, and &s;ome trade in other commodities: here are al&s;o two colleges, where polite literature is taught; be&s;ides an abbey,

and &s;everal other convents and nunneries. At the village of Malplaquet, &s;even or eight miles to the &s;outh of this city, the French, commanded by the mar&s;hals Villars and Boufflers, were, in 1709, at|tacked by the duke of Marlborough, as they lay behind triple intrenchments, and entirely defeated, though with great lo&s;s on the &s;ide of the allies. Upon this Mons, which the duke had been be|&s;ieging, &s;urrendered.</P>
<P>Soignies, a &s;mall town on the river Sonnegue. Near it is a wood, called the wood of Soignies. The &s;ecular chapter here, con&s;i&s;ting of a provo&s;t, dean, trea&s;urer, and thirty canons, are &s;piritual and temporal lords of the town, and appoint the bailiff of it.</P>
<P>St. Ghi&s;lain, a town on the river Haine, about five miles from Mons. It is pretty &s;trong by its &s;ituation on the banks of the river, and by the mar&s;hes that &s;urround it. The abbot of the famous Benedictine abbey here, is &s;tiled primate of Hainault, and is &s;pi|ritual and temporal lord of the town. In this ab|bey are always kept a bear and an eagle; becau&s;e, they &s;ay, God made u&s;e of tho&s;e animals to &s;hew St. Ghi&s;lain where he would have him build his mona|&s;tery.</P>
<P>Roeux, a &s;mall but pretty town, eight miles from Mons. It is well fortified, &s;tands in a fruitful &s;oil, has &s;everal villages within its juri&s;diction, and gives the title of earl to the hou&s;e of Croi.</P>
<P>Ath or Aeth, on the river Dender, fourteen miles from Mons, is a hand&s;ome, &s;trong, little town, and has a flouri&s;hing manufacture of linen, and a large di&s;trict belonging to it, called the Ca&s;tleward.</P>

<P>Enghein, a &s;mall town, fourteen miles from Mons. This town, with its bailiwic, containing eighteen villages, was formerly the fir&s;t barony of the county of Hainault, and was long the property of the hou&s;e of Bourbon, who &s;old it at la&s;t to the duke de Aremberg; but the elde&s;t &s;on of the prince of Cond&egrave; is &s;till &s;tiled duke of Enghein. The ti|tle of peer of Hainault was, in 1670, annexed to this town, in favour of the duke of Aremberg, who has a &s;tately &s;eat, with a fine park, noble gar|dens, and water-works, in the neighbourhood.</P>
<P>Hall or Halle, a &s;mall town on the Senne, twenty miles from Mons, and &s;even from Bru&s;&s;els. It is well fortified, and garri&s;oned for the &s;ecurity of Bru&s;&s;els. Here is a celebrated image of the Vir|gin, en&s;hrined in gold, with a crown of the &s;ame metal on its head, holding in one hand the image of our Saviour, and, in the other, a gilded ro&s;e. It is &s;aid to perform many miracles: the learned Lip&s;ius was &s;illy enough to write a book on them: abundance of pre&s;ents and pilgrimages are made to it by per&s;ons of all ranks.</P>
<P>Braine le Comte, a &s;mall town, twelve miles from Mons, and &s;ixteen from Bru&s;&s;els. It is thought to have derived its name from Brennus, a famous ge|neral of the Senonen&s;es, in Cae&s;ar's time, who is &s;aid to have built an old tower or fortre&s;s, that &s;tood here formerly, but is now in ruins.

<P>Steenkirke, a village between Enghien and Halle, famous for the battle fought there, in 1692, be|tween the army of the allies, commanded by king William, and the French, under the duke of Lux|emburg.

<HEAD>The County of NAMUR.</HEAD>
<P>This county is &s;urrounded on all &s;ides by the bi&s;hopric of Liege and the duchy of Brabant, ex|cept to the we&s;t, where it borders on the county of Hainault. Its length is reckoned about thirty miles, and its breadth about twenty-eight. The hills here are cloathed with woods full of wild fowl and veni&s;on, and lined with mines of iron and lead, and quarries of marble and &s;tone. Be|&s;ides wood they have a bituminous fat earth here,
<PB N="71" REF="700">
proper for fuel, and the lower grounds bear gra&s;s and all &s;orts of corn. The county is well watered by the Maes, the Sambre, and the Mehaigne. This, like mo&s;t of the other provinces, had counts of its own, from the year 1000 to 1421, when it was &s;old to Philip the Good, duke of Burgundy. It has now al&s;o, like the others, &s;tates, con&s;i&s;t|ing of the clergy, nobility, and the deputies of the cities, and a particular governor and council: the &s;tates, who meet only when &s;ummoned by the &s;o|vereign, have a committee, who hold their a&s;&s;em|blies at Namur: from the council of the province there lies an appeal to the grand council at Mech|lin: the arms of it are a lion &s;able, in a field or, with a dexter fe&s;&s;e, drawn over the whole &s;hield: a &s;mall part of it was ceded to the French by the treaty of Nimeguen. The principal places in it are the following.</P>
<P>Namur, which gives name to the county, and is its capital. It &s;tands at the conflux of the Maes and Sambre, over each of which it has a bridge, and is thirty miles from Bru&s;&s;els, and twenty-&s;ix from Louvain. It is e&s;teemed the &s;tronge&s;t town in Europe, having above a dozen of forts round it, be&s;ides a &s;trong ca&s;tle: one of the forts was built by the famous Coehorn, and called Fort-William, in honour of the king: however, it has been more than once taken and retaken. It is the &s;ee of a bi&s;hop, &s;uffragan to the archbi&s;hop of Mechlin: the dioce&s;e contains eight cities, upwards of three hundred villages, and a great number of abbies, collegiate churches, and religious hou&s;es of both &s;exes. The Je&s;uits church here is a noble building, all of red and black marble. Be&s;ides the magi&s;|tracy of the town and the provincial council, here is a tribunal called the &s;overeign bailiage, which judges in all feudal matters; but there lies an ap|peal

<HEAD>NAME, EXTENT, and BOUNDARIES.</HEAD>
<P>THIS kingdom was antiently called Gallia, which name it received from its inhabitants the Celtae, called by the Romans Galli. Its mo|dern name of France it had from the Franks, a German nation, who came from Franconia, in the fifth century, and fixed them&s;elves in that part of Gaul, which lies north of the river Loire. It ex|tends in length from the Pyrenean mountains in the &s;outh, to Dunkirk in the north, eight degrees and a half, that is five hundred and ten miles; and, in breadth, from the mo&s;t we&s;terly point in Brittany, to Stra&s;burg in Al&s;ace, four hundred and ninety-five miles; being bounded to the &s;outh by the Mediterranean and Spain, from which it is &s;e|parated by the Pyrenean mountains; to the north by St. George's Channel and the Netherlands;
<PB N="74" REF="740">
to the ea&s;t by Germany, Switzerland, and Italy; and to the we&s;t by the We&s;tern Ocean, or Bay of Bi&s;cay.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>AIR, SOIL, MOUNTAINS, RIVERS, and PRODUCE.</HEAD>
<P>The air is temperate, neither &s;o cold as in the northern kingdoms, nor &s;o hot as in Spain and Italy. As to the &s;oil, it is in general fruitful, though not without many barren tracts and mountains: of the la&s;t the chief are the Alps, which divide it from Italy; the Pyrenees, which divide it from Spain; and the Cevennes, in the province of Languedoc, with mount Dor in that of Auvergne. The prin|cipal rivers are, the Rhone, which ri&s;es in Switzer|land, and falls into the Mediterranean, after being joined by the Soane at Lyons, and other &s;maller rivers: this river is highe&s;t in &s;ummer, which is &s;uppo&s;ed to be owing to the melting of the &s;now on the Alps. The Seine, antiently Sequana, which ri&s;es in Burgundy, and falls into the Eng|li&s;h channel, betwixt Havre de Grace and Hon|fleur. The Loire, which ri&s;es in the Cevennes, and falls into the Bay of Bi&s;cay below Nantz: it communicates with the Seine by two canals. The Garonne, which has its &s;ource in the Pyrenees, and falls into the Bay of Bi&s;cay below Bourdeaux. This river is joined to the Mediterranean by the canal of Languedoc. France is not &s;ufficiently improved, yielding, even in plentiful years, little more corn than is nece&s;&s;ary for the &s;ub&s;i&s;tence of the inhabitants; &s;o that a bad harve&s;t is al|ways attended with great &s;carcity, e&s;pecially in time of war. A variety of fine wines are pro|duced here; but tho&s;e of Champagne, Burgundy, Bourdeaux, Pontack, Hermitage, and Frontiniac, are particularly admired. Some provinces al&s;o a|bound in olives, others in apples, capers, prunes,
<PB N="75" REF="750">
flax, and hemp, &s;ilk, wool, black cattle, mules, game, wild-fowl, medicinal and &s;alt &s;prings. The Pyrenees, Al&s;ace, Burgundy, and Lorrain, &s;up|ply the French with &s;hip-timber, but fuel begins to be &s;carce in the other provinces. A great deal of &s;alt, both bay and white, is made on the &s;ea-coa&s;ts. The maritime provinces are well &s;up|plied with fi&s;h from the &s;ea, as the others are from the rivers. Metals and minerals of &s;everal kinds are found in particular parts of the kingdom, as gold, &s;ilver, copper, iron, &s;teel, and lead, pit-coal, &s;alt-petre, and marble. In Languedoc al&s;o is a mine of torquoi&s;es; warm-baths, mineral waters, and remarkable &s;prings, are to be met with in &s;everal places.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>CHARACTER of the PEOPLE, and LANGUAGE.</HEAD>
<P>With regard to the per&s;ons and character of the French, they are not &s;o large and &s;trong as their neighbours, but nimble and active: they general|ly wear their own hair in a queue or bag: their complexions are none of the be&s;t, which, no doubt, gave ri&s;e to the cu&s;tom of painting their faces, &s;o common among the ladies. They are a gay &s;prightly people, but vain, ra&s;h, fickle, and un|&s;teady: yet they are &s;eldom dejected by misfortunes, but u&s;ually pre&s;erve their tempers in the lowe&s;t circum&s;tances. In politene&s;s, courte&s;y, and good breeding, they think no nation can pretend to vie with them; their manners, notwith&s;tanding, in many re&s;pects, are extremely offen&s;ive and &s;hock|ing to per&s;ons of true ta&s;te, &s;ound judgment, and uncorrupted morals. The mo&s;t abject flattery and di&s;&s;imulation co&s;t them nothing, they even value them&s;elves upon them, as con&s;tituting, in their opinion, the very e&s;&s;ence of politene&s;s. There is, therefore, very little &s;incerity in all their fine
<PB N="76" REF="760">
&s;peeches and profe&s;&s;ions; and whoever &s;hould lay any &s;tre&s;s upon them, would find them&s;elves greatly di&s;appointed. Though no men &s;ubmit to adver|&s;ity with a better grace, yet they are intolerably in&s;olent, vain, arbitrary, and imperious, in pro&s;|perity, and extremely litigious. The women en|joy great freedoms, and the men are &s;o far from being tormented with jealou&s;y, that they are proud of &s;eeing their wives admired and courted. Mo|de&s;ty, in&s;tead of being regarded as a virtue among the ladies, is accounted ru&s;ticity and &s;tupidity. On the other hand, it mu&s;t be allowed, that the French are very active, brave, and ingenious, have a good addre&s;s, and a genteel air. France hath produced many great men of all &s;orts, and the arts and &s;ciences have been much improved by it; the belles lettres, in particular, painting, &s;culpture, en|graving, naval and military architecture, and gun|nery, have been much indebted to it, and the dif|ferent academies e&s;tabli&s;hed in it; but philo&s;ophy and the mathematics cannot be &s;aid to have received equal benefit. The French language is formed out of that of the Gauls, Romans, and Franks, and is under&s;tood pretty generally all over Eu|rope, being very elegant, &s;ignificant, and agree|able.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>RELIGION.</HEAD>
<P>With regard to the religion of France, &s;ince the revocation of the edict of Nantz, the public exer|ci&s;e of the Roman catholic alone hath been permit|ted: yet there are &s;till great numbers of prote&s;tants in France, e&s;pecially in the &s;outhern provinces. They never would admit the inqui&s;ition in this country; and, in many re&s;pects, the king, clergy, and laity, are more free and independent of the court of Rome, than in other Roman catholic
<PB N="77" REF="770">
countries. Within the kingdom too the power of the clergy is much more limited, and more &s;ub|ject to the civil magi&s;trate, than in other countries of that per&s;ua&s;ion. The only limitation upon the king, in eccle&s;ia&s;tical matters, is the Concordat, made in 1515 betwixt Francis I. and pope Leo X. notwith&s;tanding, he nominates all archbi&s;hops, bi&s;hops, abbots, and priors, and can tax the clergy without a papal licence or mandate: accordingly, not many years &s;ince, he demanded the twentieth penny of the clergy, and, to a&s;certain that, re|quired them to deliver in an inventory of their e&s;tates and incomes; to avoid which, they volun|tarily made an offer of the annual &s;um of twelve millions of livres, over and above the u&s;ual free gift, which they pay every five years. During the vacancy of a bi&s;hopric, the king has the management of it till it is filled up, together with the nomina|tion of all the eccle&s;ia&s;tical officers, and the di&s;po|&s;al of all vacant benefices, pari&s;h churches excepted. The creed of the Gallican church is far from being &s;o favourable to the pope as that of other Roman catholic countries, as it confines his power entirely to things relative to &s;alvation, concerning which it &s;eems, at pre&s;ent, to allow him an ab&s;olute power, a&s;&s;erting his infallibility, and not admitting of an appeal from him to a general council: but the op|po&s;ers of the famous con&s;titution Unigenitus are very numerous, and vigorou&s;ly &s;upported by the parliaments. The Jan&s;eni&s;ts al&s;o, who are ac|counted a &s;ort of heretics by the more rigid papi&s;ts, are very numerous in France. In the whole king|dom there are eighteen archbi&s;hops, one hundred and thirteen bi&s;hops, &s;even hundred and &s;eventy abbies for men, three hundred and &s;eventeen ab|bies and priories for women, be&s;ides a great num|ber of le&s;&s;er convents, and two hundred and fifty commanderies of the order of Malta. The eccle|&s;ia&s;tics
<PB N="78" REF="780">
of all &s;orts are computed at near two hun|dred thou&s;and, and their revenues at about &s;ix mil|lions &s;terling.</P>

<DIV3>
<HEAD>MANUFACTURES, TRADE, and COINS.</HEAD>
<P>With regard to manufactures, France has made great improvements. The mo&s;t beautiful works in tape&s;try, filigree, and &s;culpture, are executed at the Gobelins, in Paris: no le&s;s than two hundred per&s;ons are employed there in the article of tape|&s;try alone; and the flouri&s;hing &s;tate of the arts and manufactures in France is, in a great mea&s;ure, owing to this e&s;tabli&s;hment. The &s;ilk manafacture was carried to great perfection under Lewis XIV. and at this day, the city of Lyons is di&s;tingui&s;hed above all others, for its wonderful &s;kill and inge|nuity in this re&s;pect. In the woollen manufactures al&s;o, the French have made &s;uch progre&s;s, that tho&s;e of Abbeville are &s;aid not to be greatly inferior to the Engli&s;h or Dutch, either in finene&s;s or good|ne&s;s. Be&s;ides the&s;e manufactures, tho&s;e of linen and &s;ail-cloth, &s;oap, thread, lace, &s;tuffs of all kinds, paper, gla&s;s wares, porcelain, cambricks, lawns, arms, artillery, and all &s;orts of hard-wares, toys, leather, brocades, and gold and &s;ilver lace, are very con&s;iderable: their arti&s;ans, however, in mo&s;t of the&s;e articles, are &s;urpa&s;&s;ed by the Engli&s;h. Both their manufactures and trade &s;uffered greatly by the per&s;ecution and exile of the prote&s;tants, in the reign of Lewis XIV. Their foreign trade, however, to Italy and Turky, from the &s;outh of France, to the We&s;t and Ea&s;t-Indies, the Baltic, and the North, from the ports on the ocean and the Engli&s;h Channel, is &s;till very con&s;iderable. Their We&s;t-India coronies, in particular, are very advantageous to them, employing a great number of &s;hips, and taking off large quantitities of their
<PB N="79" REF="790">
commodities and manufactures. Their fi&s;heries indeed, on the banks of Newfoundland, and their trade to the Ea&s;t-Indies, Africa, and North-Ame|rica, received a great blow in the late war, and by the ce&s;&s;ions they were obliged to make to obtain peace; for their Ea&s;t-India company was in a manner ruined, and they were forced to yield up Senegal, Canada, Cape Breton, St. John's, and their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions in Acadia or Nova-Scotia; and al&s;o to &s;ubmit to very mortifying re&s;trictions in re|gard to their catching, curing, and drying of fi&s;h, as being allowed only to catch within certain limits, and to cure and dry them only in the &s;mall i&s;lands of St. Peter and Miquelon. To &s;ee the&s;e articles of the peace exactly complied with, &s;ome &s;hips of war, under the command of a commodore, have been con&s;tantly kept by the Engli&s;h at Newfound|land, &s;ince the conclu&s;ion of the war, during the fi&s;hing-&s;ea&s;on. Thus, by endeavouring to cru&s;h the Engli&s;h, they have &s;o curtailed their power and commerce, that they will, probably, never more be in a condition to di&s;pute the empire of the ocean with them. Here is a board of trade, con&s;i&s;ting of &s;ome privy-coun&s;ellors, and twelve merchants deputed from the principal towns of France: but one great di&s;advantage to the commerce of this kingdom is, that it is not &s;o honourable as in England, and &s;ome other countries; &s;o that the French nobility think it below them, which is the rea&s;on that the church, the law, and the army, are &s;o full of them. A great many of the cities of France have the pri|vilege of coinage, and each of them a particular mark to di&s;tingui&s;h their re&s;pective pieces. The &s;everal mints are under the in&s;pection of the cours des monnoies, or mint-courts, of Paris, Lyons, and Pau. Accounts are kept in France in livres, &s;ous, and deniers. Twelve deniers is equal to a &s;ol or &s;ou, or an halfpenny Engli&s;h; and twenty &s;ous
<PB N="80" REF="800">
make a livre. The denier is a &s;mall copper piece; but both &s;ols and livres are only imaginary coins. There is another &s;mall copper coin, called a liard, equal to three deniers. An ecu is worth two &s;hil|lings and &s;ixpence, a Louis-blanc five &s;hillings, a pi&s;tole eight &s;hillings and four-pence, and a Louis-d'or one pound &s;terling.</P>

<HEAD>REVOLUTIONS and MEMORABLE EVENTS.</HEAD>
<P>France, antiently called Tran&s;alpine Gaul, or Gaul beyond the Alps, in re&s;pect of Italy, to di&s;tin|gui&s;h it from Ci&s;alpine Gaul, or Gaul on the Italian &s;ide of the Alps, was probably peopled from Italy, which adjoins to it on the ea&s;t. About forty-eight years before Chri&s;t, it was conquered by the Ro|mans under Julius Cae&s;ar. Augu&s;tus divided it into four provinces; and it continued in the po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion of the Romans until the year 400, or therea|bouts, when the northern nations broke in upon the empire. In the fifth century, the Burgundians and Goths took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it; and the&s;e were followed by the Franks, who came from Germany as well as the Burgundians, and from whom the country derived its pre&s;ent name. Thus the peo|ple of France are a mixture of the po&s;terity of the antient Gauls, Romans, Franks, Goths, and Bur|gundians, but chiefly of the Gauls; for though the Romans, and afterwards the Franks, &s;ubdued the Gauls, yet they did not expel them, &s;o that they &s;till con&s;tituted the body of the people. The fir&s;t Chri&s;tian monarch of the Franks was Clovis, who began his reign anno 468. Pepin, the &s;on of Charles Martel, who, from being maire of the pa|lace, had rai&s;ed him&s;elf to &s;overeign power, divided the provinces among his principal nobility, which gave ri&s;e to tho&s;e numerous principalities that were formerly in France, and to the &s;everal parliaments;
<PB N="81" REF="810">
for every province retained the &s;ame form of go|vernment that had before extended over the whole kingdom; no laws being made, or taxes rai&s;ed, with|out the concurrence of the grand council, con&s;i&s;t|ing of the clergy and the nobility. Charlemagne, the &s;on of Pepin, conquered Italy, Germany, and part of Spain, and was crowned emperor of the Romans by pope Leo, anno 800; to whom he confirmed the grant of the exarchate, that had been made by his father to the &s;ee of Rome. About the year 900, Normandy and Bretagne were yield|ed up to the Normans, upon condition of their quitting the other provinces. Anno 987, Hugh Capet u&s;urped the throne, and began a new line of monarchs, called the Capetine line. Anno 1066, William, duke of Normandy, and one of the crown va&s;&s;als, and petty princes of France, invaded Eng|land; and having defeated and killed Harold in battle, mounted the throne. Anno 1282, the French were ma&s;&s;acred, and expelled from Sicily; which ma&s;&s;acre having been executed on Ea&s;ter eye, when the bells rung for prayers, is generally called the Sicilian Ve&s;pers. In the year 1285, the king|dom of Navarre was added to the crown of France, by the marriage of Philip IV. with Jane, queen of Navarre: the clergy and nobility refu&s;ing to grant this king &s;upplies for the wars, he &s;ummoned the deputies or repre&s;entatives of the commons to par|liament, and con&s;tituted them a third e&s;tate, on their granting his demands: in this reign al&s;o, the order of the knight's templars was aboli&s;hed in France. Anno 1344, Hubert, count dauphin of Vienne, transferred his dominions to the crown of France, upon condition that the king's elde&s;t &s;on &s;hould be &s;tiled dauphin, as he is at this day. Edward III. of England, claiming the crown of France, in oppo&s;i|tion to Philip VI. of Valois, invaded France, and obtained a complete victory at Cre&s;&s;y, in Picardy,
<PB N="82" REF="820">
anno 1346: this claim occa&s;ioned long and bloody wars betwixt the French and Engli&s;h; and tho' the latter made great conque&s;ts in France, they lo&s;t them all again, Charles VII. recovering both Normandy and Guienne. In the reign of Lewis XI. &s;everal more provinces were reunited to the crown; and Charles VIII. annexed the duchy of Bretagne, by marrying the heire&s;s of that duchy, anno 1491. Anno 1525, Francis I. was taken pri|&s;oner, at the battle of Pavia, by the Imperiali&s;ts: it was this king who concluded the famous con|cordat with pope Leo X. On the eighteenth of Augu&s;t, in the year 1572, was perpetrated that cruel and perfidious ma&s;&s;acre of the prote&s;tants at Paris, which leaves an indelible &s;tain on the people of France. In 1589, Henry III. being &s;u&s;pected of favouring the prote&s;tants, was a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated by one Clement, a monk. In 1610, Henry IV. who pa&s;&s;ed the edict of Nantz, was a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated by one Ravilliac, a friar, in the &s;treets of Paris. Under Lewis XIII. the prote&s;tants were di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of all the towns that had been given them for their &s;ecu|rity, and the liberties of the &s;ubject almo&s;t entirely de&s;troyed, by the queen-mother, Mary of Medicis, and cardinal Richlieu; and, in the minority of Lewis XIV. cardinal Mazarine gave the fini&s;hing &s;troke to them, and rendered the government alto|gether ab&s;olute. Lewis XIV. con&s;iderably en|larged his dominions, placed his grand&s;on on the throne of Spain, extended the trade, navigation, and manufactures of his kingdom, encouraged learned and ingenious men, and thereby im|proved the arts and &s;ciences; yet, by the long and ruinous wars he was engaged in, he left an immen&s;e load of debt upon the nation, and almo&s;t entirely drained it of its people.</P>

<HEAD>The KING'S TITLES, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>The King's title is Lewis XV. by the grace of God, king of France and Navarre. The title of &s;ire is given him by his &s;ubjects, and others, when they &s;peak or write to him. In writing or &s;peak|ing of him, the French call him the king, or his maje&s;ty; but foreigners, the king of France, the mo&s;t Chri&s;tian king, or his mo&s;t Chri&s;tian maje&s;ty. The pope, in his bulls, &s;tiles him the elde&s;t &s;on of the church; becau&s;e Clovis was the fir&s;t prince after the fall of the Roman empire who embraced Chri&s;ti|anity. If the dauphin dies before the king his fa|ther, his elde&s;t &s;on of the dauphin, while his father is alive, is &s;tiled duke of Burgundy; the &s;econd duke of Aquitain, which is the antient name of Guienne; the third duke of Berry; and the fourth duke of Provence. The king's &s;econd &s;on is &s;tiled duke of Orleans, and the third duke of Anjou. The children of the royal family, in ge|neral, are called les enfans de France; and the prince&s;&s;es, me&s;dames de France; the dauphin is al&s;o &s;tiled mon&s;eigneur, and the duke of Orleans mon&s;ieur.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>CONSTITUTION.</HEAD>
<P>In regard to the con&s;titution of this kingdom, the crown is hereditary, and the king ab&s;olute: the &s;alique law limits the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to the male-i&s;&s;ue by the queens, excluding the females, and al&s;o natural &s;ons, though legitimated. The mino|rity of the king continues only till he enters his fourteenth year, unle&s;s his predece&s;&s;or has ordered it otherwi&s;e: if no regent hath been appointed by the decea&s;ed monarch, the queen-mother, if there
<PB N="84" REF="840">
is one, or the fir&s;t prince of the blood, is inve&s;ted with that office. The king is crowned at Rheims, in the cathedral, by the archbi&s;hop of that city, or the bi&s;hop of Soi&s;&s;ons, on which occa&s;ion the holy oil, &s;aid to have been brought from heaven by a dove at the coronation of Clovis, is made u&s;e of. The kingdom is indivi&s;ible. It appears from the foregoing &s;hort hi&s;tory, that the French were a free people until the reign of Lewis XIII. and every province almo&s;t had its parliament, without who&s;e concurrence no affairs of con&s;equence were tran&s;acted. The parliament of Paris, in particular, had formerly very great authority, but it is now wholly &s;ubject to the crown, though it &s;till en|joys &s;ome prerogatives above the other parlia|ments of the kingdom. When any new tax is propo&s;ed, the &s;tates of &s;ome provinces a&s;&s;em|ble; but their power extends no farther than to &s;ettle the method of rai&s;ing and levying it, and to make an a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ment for that purpo&s;e. The only legi&s;lative power in France, at pre&s;ent, is in the king, who&s;e edicts, with a <HI>&s;oit car tel e&s;t notre bon plai&s;ir,</HI> Let this edict be executed, for &s;uch is our good plea&s;ure; being regi&s;tered in the &s;everal par|liaments of the kingdom, which are all compo&s;ed of per&s;ons at the devotion of the court, have the full force of law. The parliaments have &s;carce any other bu&s;ine&s;s now than to admini&s;ter ju&s;tice: however, they &s;till venture &s;ometimes to make very bold remon&s;trances. For the admini&s;tration of the government under the king, there are, at pre&s;ent, &s;everal councils, viz. the &s;upreme council of &s;tate, the council des depeches, the council of finances, the council of trade, the privy-council, that called le grand con&s;eil, and the high court of chancery. For the admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice al&s;o, there are a great number of inferior courts, from which appeals lie to the bailiages and &s;enechau&s;ees, from them to the pre&s;idial courts, and from the&s;e la&s;t to
<PB N="85" REF="850">
the parliaments, which at pre&s;ent are twelve, viz. tho&s;e of Paris, Thoulou&s;e, Rouen, Grenoble, Bourdeaux, Dijon, Aix, Rennes, Pau, Metz, Be|&s;an&ccedil;on, and Douay: in Al&s;ace and Rou&s;illon are courts of much the &s;ame nature. The king's edicts mu&s;t be regi&s;tered in all the&s;e before they are of force; but hardly any of them, except &s;ome|times that of Paris, ever venture to make any diffi|culty about it. The princes of the blood, with the dukes and counts, peers of France, and the archbi&s;hop of Paris, &s;it and vote in the parliament of Paris; and by it the princes of the blood, the principal officers of &s;tate, dukes, peers, and eccle|&s;ia&s;tics, are tried. All the places in the&s;e par|liaments, tho&s;e of the judges not excepted, are pur|cha&s;ed. In &s;ome provinces the admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice is regulated by the Roman law, in others by their particular cu&s;toms, &s;o far as they are con&s;i&s;t|ent with the king's edicts and declarations. The king's ordinances for the maintaining and explaining the liberties of the Gallican church, form the chief part of the eccle&s;ia&s;tical law in France. Tho' the number of the inhabitants be computed at twenty millions, yet &s;ome parts of the kingdom are but very indifferently peopled. The nobility con&s;i&s;ts of four cla&s;&s;es: the princes of the blood; the high nobility; the ordinary nobility; and the nobility lately made. He who &s;tands next the crown, after the king's children, is the fir&s;t prince of the blood. Among the higher nobility, the dukes and counts, peers of France, have the precedence; they a&s;&s;i&s;t at the unction of the king, attend when he holds a lit de ju&s;tice, and enjoy a &s;eat in the parliament of Paris. Among the higher nobility are reckoned al&s;o the knights of the Holy Gho&s;t, and the go|vernors of provinces and lieutenant generals, with the other dukes, counts, and marqui&s;es. The ordinary nobility are generally &s;tiled ecuyers, and are divided into the noble&s;&s;e de race, and the no|ble&s;&s;e
<PB N="86" REF="860">
de nai&s;ance. The new nobility are tho&s;e to whom the king has granted letters of nobility, or conferred &s;ome po&s;t upon, by which they are enno|bled. There are &s;ome privileges that are common to all the nobles, as an exemption from the poll|tax, the quartering of &s;oldiers, and the duties of franc-fief, with &s;ome others. The orders of knight|hood in France, are tho&s;e of St. Michael, the Ho|ly Gho&s;t, and St. Lewis: the fir&s;t was in&s;tituted in the year 1469, and con&s;i&s;ts of one hundred knights: the &s;econd was in&s;tituted in 1578, and con&s;i&s;ts al&s;o of one hundred knights, be&s;ides the &s;overeign, and is conferred only on the princes of the blood, peers, and other great men of the fir&s;t quality: the order of St. Lewis was in&s;tituted by Lewis XIV. for the encouragement of the officers of the army.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>REVENUES and FORCES.</HEAD>
<P>The revenue is either ordinary or extraordinary. The ordinary ari&s;es from the deme&s;nes; the duty on wine; the gabelle or &s;alt-duty; the taille, from which the nobility, clergy, and certain officers, are exempted, except in a few di&s;tricts; the capi|tation or poll-tax; the cu&s;toms of all kinds; the duty on &s;tampt-paper, and &s;everal others; together with the gift of the clergy, already mentioned. As to the extraordinary revenue, it depends upon the king's plea&s;ure: among the methods &s;ometimes taken in regard to it, are the rai&s;ing the value of the coin, compounding &s;tate-bills or debentures, and other arbitrary mea&s;ures. The ordinary re|venue at pre&s;ent, is computed at about ten millions &s;terling. For the collection of the impo&s;ts and taxes, the kingdom is divided into generalities and intendancies, and the&s;e again into other le&s;&s;er divi|&s;ions, generally called elections: &s;ome branches of
<PB N="87" REF="870">
the revenue, as the cu&s;toms, wine-licence, &s;alt and &s;tamp-duty, po&s;ts, &amp;c. are farmed to the company of farmers-general, who have their under-farmers and receivers. At the head of the officers of the finances is the comptroller-general; and for the management of the revenue, and the determination of all di&s;putes relating to it, there are &s;everal tribu|nals and offices in different parts of the kingdom, of which that of Paris is the principal. Notwith|&s;tanding the enormous taxes and impo&s;itions, and va&s;t revenues produced by them, the trea&s;ury is not only frequently empty, but hath been more than once involved in prodigious debts, and the people, by endle&s;s exactions, reduced to the la&s;t degree of wretchedne&s;s, chiefly from the ambitious views and intrigues of the court; and this is &s;aid to be pretty much the ca&s;e at pre&s;ent, the late war having not only greatly di&s;ordered their finances, but &s;topped up &s;ome of its principal re&s;ources. With re&s;pect to the forces of France, in time of peace they are &s;eldom under two hundred thou&s;and; and in time of war are often double that number. The art of war is no where better under&s;tood than in France, that part of it e&s;pecially which relates to gunnery and fortification; for be&s;ides other advantages for learning it, here is a royal academy for training up five hundred young gentlemen in the &s;everal branches of the art, and a great number of for|tre&s;&s;es. For the maintenance of officers and &s;oldiers, di&s;abled, or worn out in the &s;ervice, there are above &s;eventy military ho&s;pitals, be&s;ides the hotel des in|valides at Paris. The navy of France is al&s;o very con&s;iderable. In the reign of Lewis XIV. they had no le&s;s than one hundred &s;hips of the line of battle; and though their marine was almo&s;t en|tirely de&s;troyed in the late war, in which they were foiled in every engagement, yet they have been extremely active &s;ince the peace, in re&s;toring it.
<PB N="88" REF="880">
But con&s;idering how low it was brought, it mu&s;t require a great expence, and many years, to bring it to its former condition; and, indeed, as their trade, in con&s;equence of the lo&s;&s;es they &s;uffered in the late war, is much le&s;s exten&s;ive than formerly, it cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed that this will be in their power, till they fir&s;t find means to recover their lo&s;&s;es, which, it is to be hoped, Great Britain will attentively guard again&s;t, as her pro&s;perity and tranquility &s;o much depend upon it. The &s;eamen in the maritime provinces are regi&s;tered, and di|vided into cla&s;&s;es: each cla&s;s &s;erves three or four years alternately; and tho&s;e who are not in actual &s;ervice, may enter on board merchant &s;hips. The &s;tations for the men of war, are Toulon on the Mediterranean, and Bre&s;t, Port-Louis, Rochefort, and Havre de Grace, on the channel; there are al&s;o fifteen gallies, which lie at Mar&s;eilles. A hundred independent companies are maintained to &s;erve on board the &s;hips of war as marines, and all the &s;ea-ports are well fortified.</P>

<HEAD>The GOVERNMENT of PARIS.</HEAD>
<P>In this government, which, be&s;ides the capital, comprehends a part of the neighbouring country, the principal places are,</P>
<P>Paris, the capital of the kingdom, in Latin Pari&s;ii, Lute, or Lutetia Pari&s;iorum, &s;ituate on the river Seine, in the I&s;le of France, being one of the large&s;t and fine&s;t cities in Europe. It de|rived its modern name from the antient Pari&s;ii, and is &s;uppo&s;ed, by &s;ome, to have had the Latin name of Lutetia, from Lutum, mud, the place where

<PB N="89" REF="900">
it now &s;tands, having been antiently very mar&s;hy and muddy. Ever &s;ince the reign of Hugh Capet, that is for near eight hundred years, this city hath been the u&s;ual re&s;idence of the kings of France: it is of a circular form, and, including the &s;uburbs, about five French leagues, or fifteen Engli&s;h miles in circumference. The number of its inhabitants is computed at about five hundred thou&s;and, that of its &s;treets nine hundred and twelve, and that of its hou&s;es upwards of twenty thou&s;and, exclu&s;ive of the public &s;tructures of all &s;orts. Its greate&s;t defect, according to &s;ome, is the want of good drinking-water; but others tell us, that very fine water is brought by an aqueduct from the village of Arcueil, not far from Paris, but own the water of the Seine, and the city, is not good. The &s;treets are of a proper breadth, well built, paved, and lighted. There is a great number of tribunals and offices here, mo&s;t of which are kept in the Palais, &s;ituated on an i&s;land, to which it gives name. The number of churches, convents, ho&s;pitals, market-places, fountains, gates, and bridges, in this city, is very great, be&s;ides the univer&s;ity, &s;e|veral academies, public libraries, royal palaces, and ca&s;tles, and above one hundred hotels, &s;ome of them very &s;tately. But to be more particular, that part called la Cit&eacute;, lies in the centre, and con|&s;i&s;ts of three i&s;lands formed by the Seine, viz. L'I&s;le de Palais, L'I&s;le de Notre Dame, and L'I&s;le Louviers. It is the principal of the three parts into which the city is divided, and contains the fol|lowing remarkable &s;tructures, 1. Several bridges, of which &s;ome are of wood and others of &s;tone, and have mo&s;t of them a row of hou&s;es on each &s;ide; the chief of the&s;e are the Pont-neuf and Pont-royal; the fir&s;t con&s;i&s;ts of twelve arches, which, properly &s;peaking, make two bridges, the one leading from the &s;uburbs of St. Germain to the city, and the
<PB N="90" REF="910">
other from thence to that part called la Ville: there is a carriage-way in the middle, thirty feet broad, and foot-walks on each &s;ide, rai&s;ed two feet high; and, in the centre, &s;tands a bra&s;s &s;tatue of king Henry IV. on hor&s;eback. On this bridge is al&s;o the building called La Samaritaine, from a group of figures upon it, repre&s;enting our Saviour and the Samaritan woman, &s;tanding near Jacob's well. Here is a pump to rai&s;e the water, which, thro' &s;everal pipes, &s;upplies the quarter of the Louvre, and &s;ome other parts of the town. The Pont|royal, which leads to the Thuilleries, was built by order of Lewis XIV. in the room of a wooden bridge, that was carried away by the current in 1684. 2. The cathedral of Notre Dame, or our Lady, being dedicated to the Holy Virgin, which is a large &s;tately Gothic &s;tructure, &s;aid to have been founded by king Childeric, and built in the form of a cro&s;s. Here, be&s;ides other great per&s;onages, are interred the cardinals de Retz and Noailles. From the two &s;quare towers belonging to it, is a noble pro&s;pect of the city and neighbouring coun|try. Here is a va&s;t quantity of gold and &s;ilver plate, rich tape&s;try, and fine paintings; and the number of the canons is no le&s;s than fifty. Near it &s;tands the palace of the archbi&s;hop, in which is the advocates library: the revenue of the archbi&s;hop amounts to about one hundred and eighty thou&s;and livers, and his taxation to the court of Rome, is four thou&s;and two hundred and eighty three guilders. 3. The priory and pari&s;h church of St. Bartholomew, the la&s;t of which is the mo&s;t beautiful in all this part of the city, and &s;tands near the Palais. 4. The Palais, which gives name to an i&s;land, and in which the parliament, with a great many other courts, are held. It was antiently the re&s;idence of the kings, but was given to the officers of ju&s;tice by Philip the Fair, who al&s;o &s;ettled the parliament here in
<PB N="19" REF="920">
1302. The parliament, con&s;i&s;ting of &s;everal cham|bers, each of which has its department, is opened the day after Martinmas, with a &s;olemn ma&s;s, ce|lebrated by a bi&s;hop, and continues &s;itting till the eighth of September, when a vacation-chamber is appointed, during the interval, for criminal cau&s;es, and others which require di&s;patch. The juri&s;dic|tion of this court is of great extent. There is a beautiful chapel belonging to the Palais, in which is al&s;o the pri&s;on, or jail, for the juri&s;diction of the parliament, called in French, La Concier|gerie. 5. The Hotel Dieu, the mo&s;t antient and large&s;t ho&s;pital in Paris, in which eight thou&s;and &s;ick and infirm poor are taken care of, and attended by the nuns of the order of St. Augu&s;tine. 6. The ho&s;pital of St. Catharine, where poor women and maidens are entertained three days, and attend|ed by the abovementioned nuns. 7. The Grande Chatelet, where &s;ome of the inferior courts of ju|&s;tice hold their &s;e&s;&s;ions. 8. Fort l'Eveque, in which is the mint, and a pri&s;on. It &s;tands in or near the &s;treet la Ferroniere, in which Henry IV. was &s;tabbed by Ravilliac. 9. St. Germain l'Auxerrois, which is called the royal pari&s;h church, becau&s;e the palaces of the Louvre and Thuilleries &s;tand in its pari&s;h. 10. The Louvre, an antient royal palace, of which a part was rebuilt by Lewis XIV. Had it been completed on the &s;ame plan, it would have been a mo&s;t magnificent &s;tructure. <Q>On one of its gates is the following in|&s;cription, <HI>Dum totum impleat orbim,</HI> the meaning of which is, &startq;May it la&s;t till the owner of it hath extended his &s;way over the whole world,&endq; which implies what the French kings have con&s;tantly aimed at.</Q> Another in&s;cription &s;hews, at the &s;ame time, the vanity of the nation, and their abject flattery of their grande monarque.

<L>God him alone exceeds, as heaven does it.</L></Q>
<P>This palace is joined to the Thuilleries by a gallery, in which are one hundred and eighty models of fortre&s;&s;es, &s;ome &s;ituated in France, and &s;ome in other countries, executed with the utmo&s;t accu|racy. Here is a valuable collection of paintings, the king's printing-hou&s;e, the mint where the king's medals are &s;truck, together with a prodigi|ous quantity of rich tape&s;try hangings, and a col|lection of antient arms, among which are tho&s;e worn by Francis I. at the famous battle of Pavia. Here al&s;o the French academy, the academy of in&s;criptions and belles lettres, the royal academy of &s;ciences, the academy of painting and &s;culp|ture, and the royal academy of architecture, have their meetings. The fir&s;t of the&s;e was founded for the improvement of the French language; and as for the others, their names explain the de&s;ign of their in&s;titution. 11. Le Palais Royal, which was built by cardinal Richlieu, in the year 1636, and belongs to the duke of Orleans. It is &s;aid to con|tain pictures to the value of four millions of livres, which were purcha&s;ed by the regent of that title, and of which a part belonged to Chri&s;tina, queen of Sweden. 12. The palace des Tuilleries, &s;o called from a tile or brick kiln which &s;tood there for|merly. This palace, as we ob&s;erved above, com|municates with the Louvre by a gallery. Behind it are exceeding plea&s;ant gardens, adorned with fine walks, planted with ever-greens, and other trees, and with beautiful parterres, where are to be &s;een, all the year round, every flower according to its &s;ea&s;on. There are al&s;o three fine fountains in the garden, and a canal. Behind the Tuilleries, on the bank of the river, are plea&s;ant walks, compo&s;ed of four rows of lofty elms, to which va&s;t crouds of
<PB N="93" REF="940">
people re&s;ort in the fine weather, as well as to the gardens. In the palace is a &s;pacious and magni|ficent theatre, and hard by it are the Ely&s;ian fields, where a &s;urpri&s;ing number of coaches are to be &s;een in fair weather: not far off al&s;o is the church of St. Roche, where the celebrated poet Corneille is interred. 13. La place de Louis le Grand, a very beautiful &s;quare, in the centre of which is an eque|&s;trian &s;tatue of that king, which is ju&s;tly accounted a ma&s;ter-piece. 14. The place, or &s;quare des Victoires, which is round, and contains a &s;tatue of Lewis XIV. of gilt bra&s;s, erected to him by the duke de la Fuillade, with this in&s;cription, <HI>Viro immortali.</HI> 15. The royal library in the Rue Vivien, which contains ninety-four thou&s;and printed books, thirty thou&s;and manu&s;cripts, and a prodigious collection of copper-plates and medals. Near by in the church-yard of St. Jo&s;eph, lies the famous comic poet Moliere. 16. The pari&s;h church of St. Eu&s;tace, which &s;tands in the quarter of the &s;ame name, and contains the tomb of the great mini&s;ter Colbert. 17. The gate of St. Dennis, which was erected as a triumphal arch in honour of Lewis XIV. 18. The gate of St. Martin, erected al&s;o in form of a triumphal arch, in honour of the &s;ame king. Not far from hence, in the church-yard of St. Nicholas des Champs, Peter Ga&s;&s;endi, and other learned men, are buried. 19. La Greve, an open place, where all public rejoicings are celebrated, and malefactors executed. 20. The hotel de Ville, which is a large building of Gothic architecture, though adorned with columns of the Corinthian order. 21. The ar&s;e|nal in the quarter of St. Paul, con&s;i&s;ting of many &s;pacious buildings, among which are a foundery, and a hou&s;e for making &s;alt-petre. Here is a mu&s;que|toon of two barrels, which, it is &s;aid, will pierce a thick board at the di&s;tance of &s;ix miles, and, for di&s;cerning an object at that di&s;tance, has a tele&s;|cope
<PB N="94" REF="950">
fixed to the barrel. 22. The Ba&s;tile, a kind of fortre&s;s like the Tower of London, which is u&s;ed as a pri&s;on for &s;tate criminals, and for &s;uch as are taken up by letters de cachet, i. e. by warrants &s;igned by the king, and &s;ealed. 23. Le Temple, a commandery, of the knights of Malta, which gives name to a quarter, wherein, being a privi|leged place, artificers, that are not freemen, may carry on their bu&s;ine&s;s without mole&s;tation. The temple is the re&s;idence of the grand-prior of the French nation. 24. That formerly called La Mai&s;on profe&s;&s;e des Je&s;uites, in the quarter of St. Anthony, in the church of which the hearts of Lewis XIII. and XIV. are pre&s;erved, each in a ca&s;ket of gold, &s;upport|ed by two angels of ma&s;&s;y &s;ilver, and as big as the life, hovering with expanded wings. In the &s;ame quar|ter is a fine looking gla&s;s manufacture, where above five hundred per&s;ons are employed in poli&s;hing plates, ca&s;t at St. Gobin; with a convent of Fran|ci&s;cans, the monks of which are called Pique-puces, or Prick-fleas.</P>

<HEAD>In that part of the city called the UNIVERSITY, the principal places are,</HEAD>
<P>1. The univer&s;ity which gives name to it, and which was fir&s;t founded, as it is &s;aid, by Charles the Great: all the arts and &s;ciences are taught here, particularly law, phy&s;ic, and divinity. There are above forty colleges, of which the chief are tho&s;e of the Sorbonne, of Navarre, of the faculty of phy&s;ic, and of the four nations; but lectures are read only in eleven of them. The head of the univer&s;ity is the rector, who is cho&s;en every three months, but &s;ometimes is continued &s;everal years. All the profe&s;&s;ors have &s;ettled &s;alaries; the whole annual income of the univer&s;ity amounting, it is &s;aid, to about fifty thou&s;and livres. 2. The Gobelins,

a hou&s;e or palace, where a great number of inge|nious arti&s;ts, in various manufactures and handi|crafts, are employed by the government. The mo&s;t curious tape&s;try of all &s;orts is made here. 3. The General Ho&s;pital, a mo&s;t noble foundation for the poor of the female &s;ex, hear &s;even thou|&s;and objects being taken care of and provided for. The &s;ick are carefully tended, and tho&s;e that are in health are obliged to work; different wards being allotted for foundlings, for girls who &s;ew and knit, pro&s;titutes, idiots, and poor women: of the la&s;t, &s;ome are kept gratis, and others pay a &s;mall matter. In the ca&s;tle of Bic&ecirc;tre, belonging to this ho&s;pital, and con&s;i&s;ting of many large build|ings, are near four thou&s;and per&s;ons of the other &s;ex, among which are per&s;ons di&s;ordered in their &s;en&s;es, and &s;uch as are afflicted with the venereal di&s;ea&s;e. To this ho&s;pital are al&s;o &s;ent children who abu&s;e their parents, and lead di&s;&s;olute lives. The fund for the maintenance of it, and the ho&s;|pital de la Pictie, where poor children are brought up, together with the Hotel Dieu, amounts to above two millions of livres per annum. 4. The King's Phy&s;ic Garden, in which are an infinite va|riety of plants and trees; a certain &s;um being al|lotted by the king for keeping the garden in order, and improving it, and for lectures on botany, ana|tomy, chymi&s;try, and the materia medica. A cu|rious collection of natural curio&s;ities is kept here. 5.

The abbey of St. Germain des Prez, which con|tains a very valuable library, the manu&s;cripts alone making eight thou&s;and volumes: here al&s;o is a cabinet of antiquities. 18. The Hotel royal des In|valides, erected by Lewis XIV. in which lame and &s;uperannuated officers and &s;oldiers are maintained. The buildings take up no le&s;s than &s;eventeen acres. The number of common &s;oldiers here amount to about three thou&s;and, and of officers to about five hundred. The chapel is very magnificent. Hard by is a military academy, in which five hundred young gentlemen are in&s;tructed in the art of war.

<HEAD>The GOVERNMENT of the ISLE of FRANCE.</HEAD>
<P>In this government is included not only the I&s;le of France, but a part al&s;o of Perche, Picardy, Brie, Gatinois, Beauce, and all Le Vexin Francois. It is fruitful in grain, fruits, and wine, and con|tains the following remarkable places,</P>
<P>St. Denis, commonly called St. Denis en France, in Latin, Sti Diony&s;ii Fanum, which lies about two leagues from Paris to the north. Here is an abbey of great antiquity, which has been lately rebuilt, dedicated to St. Denis, the patron, or tutelar &s;aint of France. It has an elegant garden, and contains a rich trea&s;ure, in which are al&s;o kept the crown-jewels. In its church are the &s;epulchres of the French kings, the princes and prince&s;&s;es of the blood, and other great per&s;onages, particularly that of mar&s;hal Turenne. The convent, which is of the Benedictine order, and, with its precincts, immediately &s;ubject to the pope, has an income of about &s;ixty thou&s;and livres, together with the lord|&s;hip of the town. The title of abbot was &s;uppre&s;&s;ed in 1692, and his revenue granted to the convent of St. Cyr, founded by Lewis XIV. for the edu|cation of ladies. This town is al&s;o noted for its fairs.</P>
<P>Vincennes, a palace hard by Paris, &s;tanding in a fine park, or wood, called Le Bois de Vincennes,
<PB N="98" REF="990">
which belongs to the king, together with the pa|lace. The park takes up one thou&s;and four hun|dred and &s;ixty-four acres of ground. The avenue leading to the ca&s;tle, which is u&s;ed as a &s;tate-pri|&s;on, is planted with four rows of &s;tately elms; and not far from it is a menagerie and a manufac|ture of porcelain.</P>
<P>Montmorency, a little old town, three leagues from Paris to the north-we&s;t. The antient dukes of Montmorenci took their name and title of duke from this town, in the church of which their tombs are to be &s;een. It now belongs to the hou&s;e of Cond&eacute;, and contains a convent of monks of the Holy Trinity, for the redemption of captives.</P>
<P>Charenton, a con&s;iderable town, &s;ituated on the Marne, over which it has a &s;tone bridge, about two &s;hort leagues from Paris. Here, before the revocation of the edict of Nantz, the Huguenots had their principal church, and their mo&s;t emi|nent preachers and divines.</P>
<P>Brie Comte Robert, a little town on the river Yerre.</P>
<P>Corbeil, a town at the conflux of the E&s;&s;one and Seine, in which is an ho&s;pital, with &s;everal con|vents and churches. Its chief trade is in &s;kins, and it has two bridges, one over the Seine, and the other over the E&s;&s;one, or Juine.</P>
<P>Cre&s;py, the capital of the duchy of Valois, &s;itu|ated eleven miles from Paris to the north-ea&s;t, and belonging, together with the duchy, to the duke of Orleans. Here are two churches, and a con|vent, and a con&s;iderable trade in grain and wood.</P>
<P>Senlis, a town near the little river Nonette, &s;even leagues from Paris to the north, which is the &s;ee of a bi&s;hop, &s;uffragan to the archbi&s;hop of Rheims, who&s;e revenue is above twenty thou&s;and livres. The air here is reckoned very healthful,
<PB N="99" REF="1000">
for which rea&s;on &s;everal of the children of France have been nur&s;ed in its ca&s;tle. There is al&s;o a gra|nary in the town; the inhabitants of which are chiefly employed in wa&s;hing and preparing the wool for the manufactures of Beauvais.</P>
<P>Chantilly, a pretty little town, belonging to the hou&s;e of Conde, which has a &s;eat in it.</P>
<P>Compeigne, an antient town, &s;ituated on the Oi&s;e, near the fore&s;t, which takes its name from it, thirteen leagues from Paris to the north-we&s;t. The Maid of Orleans was taken pri&s;oner by the Engli&s;h at this place, in 1430. There is a royal palace here, which was repaired by Lewis XIV. and the gardens laid out, as they are at pre&s;ent, with a Be|nedictine abbey, dedicated to St. Cornelius, and &s;ome trade in corn, wood, and wool. The town, with its fore&s;t, the latter of which contains twenty-nine thou&s;and acres, belong to the king, and have never been alienated &s;ince the time of Clovis.</P>
<P>Villers Corteretz, a little town, five leagues from Compeigne to the &s;outh-ea&s;t, at the &s;ide of the fore&s;t of Retz, whence it derives its name. Here is a fine palace belonging to the duke of Or|leans, and an abbey.</P>
<P>Soi&s;&s;ons, in Latin, Noviodunum, and Augu&s;ta Sue&s;&s;ionum, the capital of this government, &s;itu|ated &s;even leagues from Paris to the north-ea&s;t, and about eight from Rheims to the we&s;t, in a plea&s;ant valley, on the banks of the river Ai&s;ne, over which there is a &s;tone bridge. The town is pretty large and well built, being the &s;eat of a governor-general, and of an office of the finances, a &s;alt-office, &s;everal courts of ju&s;tice, and al&s;o of a bi&s;hop, who is &s;uffragan to the archbi&s;hop of Rheims, and has the right to anoint the French kings during the vacancy of the archiepi&s;copal &s;ee, or in the archbi&s;hop's ab&s;ence, with a revenue of eighteen thou&s;and livres per annum, out of which
<PB N="100" REF="1010">
he pays a tax to Rome of two thou&s;and four hun|dred florins. Antiently, this town was the &s;eat of Devitiacus, one of the kings of the Gauls; af|terwards, for &s;ome time, of the Roman praetors, in Gallia Belgica; and then of the fir&s;t French kings, being then the capital of a kingdom, to which it al&s;o gave name, as it does now to a territory called Le Soi&s;&s;onnois. It drives a great trade in corn, contains &s;everal abbies and other religious hou&s;es, with an old ca&s;tle, and has an academy of men of wit and genius, who&s;e object is the &s;ame as that of the French academy at Paris. The late prince Eugene's mother had the title of counte&s;s of Soi&s;|&s;ons.</P>
<P>Noyon, in Latin Noviodunum, Noviomagum, Noviomum, and Noviomagus Vuromanduorum, a large, antient, well built town, on the declivity of a hill by the river Vor&s;e, which, at a little di&s;tance from hence falls into the Oi&s;e, &s;ixteen leagues from Paristo the north. It is the &s;ee of a bi&s;hop, &s;uffragan to the archbi&s;hop of Rheims, and a count and peer of France, who&s;e revenue amounts to about twen|ty-five thou&s;and livres per annum. The cele|brated John Calvin was a native of this town, which is the &s;eat of a governor, and &s;everal courts of ju&s;tice, containing al&s;o &s;everal churches and con|vents, with two abbies, an epi&s;copal palace, a ca|thedral, &s;ome hand&s;ome fountains, two public gar|dens, and two ho&s;pitals. It gives name to a ter|ritory, called Le Noyonnois, has &s;everal manufac|tures, and carries on a trade in wheat and oats, which it &s;ends to Paris.</P>
<P>Laon, in Latin Laudunum, Laudunum Cla|vatum, Laodunum, or Lodunum, a hand&s;ome town, &s;ituated in a good air, twenty-two leagues from Paris to the north-ea&s;t. It is the &s;eat of a governor and &s;everal courts of ju&s;tice, and the &s;ee of a bi&s;hop, who is &s;uffragan to the archbi&s;hop
<PB N="101" REF="1020">
of Rheims, and a duke and peer, having a reve|nue of thirty thou&s;and livres per annum, out of which he pays the court of Rome four thou&s;and florins. The town gives name to a di&s;trict, and contains an old ca&s;tle, with &s;everal convents and churches, be&s;ides the cathedral, and a college, which is maintained at the expence of the city.</P>
<P>Promontr&egrave;, a village four leagues from Noyon to the ea&s;t, noted for an abbey, the chief of the or|der of Praemon&s;traten&s;es, with a revenue of forty-five thou&s;and livres per annum.</P>
<P>Beauvais, in Latin Bellovacum and Cae&s;aro Ma|gus, the capital of the province, called from the town Beauvai&s;is, &s;ituated fourteen leagues from Paris to the north-we&s;t, and twelve from Rouen to the ea&s;t. It is the &s;ee of a bi&s;hop, who is both &s;pi|ritual and temporal lord of the city, &s;uffragan to the archbi&s;hop of Rheims, and a duke and peer of France, with a revenue of fifty-five thou&s;and livres per annum, out of which he pays the pope four thou&s;and &s;ix hundred florins. Here is a great number of churches and convents, &s;everal courts of ju&s;tice, with manufactures of tape&s;try, linen, &s;erge, and woollen cloths.</P>
<P>Clermont en Bauvai&s;is, a con&s;iderable town, &s;ituated on the river Breche, five leagues from Beauvais.</P>
<P>Gerberoi, a &s;mall town four or five leagues from Beauvais, near which, in a valley &s;till called the Valley of Arundel, the Engli&s;h, under the com|mand of the earl of Arundel, were totally de|feated, in the year 1435; and the earl him&s;elf re|ceived a wound, of which he died &s;oon after.</P>
<P>Pontoi&s;e or Pont-Oi&s;e, the capital of the terri|tory called Vexin Francois, &s;tanding five leagues from Paris to the north-we&s;t, on the Oi&s;e, over which it has a bridge, as its name implies. Hither the parliament of Paris was bani&s;hed, in 1720 and 1753,
<PB N="102" REF="1030">
by the pre&s;ent king of France. This town is the &s;eat of &s;everal courts, and contains two convents, one of Capuchins, and another of Benedictines.</P>
<P>Mante, a town &s;ituated nine leagues from Paris, on the Seine, over which it has a fine &s;tone bridge, of thirty-nine arches. Here are &s;everal courts, convents, and churches. Over-again&s;t the town is a plea&s;ant i&s;land in the Seine, called Champion.</P>
<P>Meulan, a little town, &s;even leagues below Pa|ris, on the Seine, over which it has two bridges. It gives name to a di&s;trict, and contains &s;everal churches, a fort, and two convents.</P>
<P>Dreux, a very antient town, &s;ituated on the little river Blai&s;e, about thirteen or fourteen leagues from Paris to the we&s;t, which is thought either to have given name to the Druids, or to have borrowed its name from them. Here is a woollen manufac|ture, that furni&s;hes cloathing to the army; and, in time of peace, corn and wine are &s;ent from hence to Rouen, and from that city to Holland and England. A great battle was fought near this town, in 1562, between the Roman catholics and the Huguenots, in which the latter were defeated. This town gives the title of count, and contains a ca&s;tle, &s;everal churches, and two convents.</P>
<P>St. Cloud, a borough &s;ituated on the Seine, two leagues below Paris, and belonging to the archbi|&s;hop of that city, to whom it gives the title of duke and peer. The duke of Orleans has a pa|lace here, with very fine gardens.</P>
<P>Ver&s;ailles, a town &s;ituated four leagues from Paris to the &s;outh-we&s;t. Here Lewis XIV. built a mo&s;t magnificent palace, and adorned it with no|ble gardens: it &s;tands on a ri&s;ing ground, in the middle of a valley &s;urrounded with hills, having, on the &s;ide towards Paris, a fine avenue leading to it through the town, which it divides into the Old and New. To give a particular account of this
<PB N="103" REF="1040">
palace would be incon&s;i&s;tent with our plan: &s;uffice it to &s;ay, that it con&s;i&s;ts of &s;everal courts, embelli&s;hed (both within and without) in the mo&s;t &s;umptuous manner. The grove here is exceeding beautiful, and the water-works very grand. The menagerie con&s;i&s;ts of &s;even courts, and contains a va&s;t number of rare animals. In the palace all the parts in the in&s;ide, that are not hung with tape&s;tries, are lined with marble; and the nearer you come to the king's apartments, the more co&s;tly is the marble, and the finer the &s;culp|ture and painting. It would require volumes to de&s;cribe the various paintings and antique &s;tatues, with which all the apartments abound. The chapel is an exqui&s;ite piece of architecture, &s;culp|ture, and painting. Of all the apartments, the king's bedchamber is the mo&s;t magnificent; the bed, which is of crim&s;on velvet, embroidered with gold, &s;tanding in a kind of alcove, where are two figures of Fame repre&s;ented &s;itting. The canal in the gar|den, by which the river Eure is conveyed to it, is a very noble one: the orangery or greenhou&s;e is ac|counted a fine piece of architecture, and indeed a ma&s;ter-piece of its kind; the parterre before it al&s;o is very beautiful, being adorned with a great number of orange and lemon-trees, myrtles, lau|rels, &amp;c. the Labyrinth or Maze is a fine grove, &s;o called, becau&s;e its &s;everal walks are &s;o interwoven with each other, that it would be a difficult matter for a per&s;on to find his way out of it without a guide: in &s;hort, the garden, for &s;tatues, canals, groves, grottos, fountains, and every thing that can render it delightful, is &s;uperior to any thing of the kind in Europe. The royal cabinet contains the choice&s;t medals, coins, paintings, &amp;c. that Italy could af|ford. The &s;tables, for proportion, conveniency, beauty, and architecture, far exceed many royal pa|laces. In the &s;ame park &s;tands the fine palace of
<PB N="104" REF="1050">
Trianon, the out&s;ide of which con&s;i&s;ts wholly of va|riegated marble, of exqui&s;ite workman&s;hip. The gardens are large, and abound in &s;tatues and water-works.</P>
<P>Marly, a village, where is a fine royal palace, in a wood near the Seine, and in the neighbourhood of Ver&s;ailles, with beautiful gardens. The engine here for rai&s;ing water from the Seine, to &s;upply the re&s;ervoirs and water-works, is equally grand and ingenious, and, with the other water-works, co&s;t immen&s;e &s;ums; the water being conveyed over &s;everal hills to the great re&s;ervoir here, and from thence to Ver&s;ailles. The yearly expence of keeping the machine in repair is &s;aid to be an hun|dred and fifty thou&s;and livres.</P>
<P>St. Germain en Laye, a town in the fore&s;t of Laye, on the banks of the Seine, four leagues from Paris to the we&s;t. It is chiefly remarkable for two ca&s;tles, or royal palaces, the gardens of which were formerly very noble, but are now much neglected: tho&s;e of one of them extend to the very banks of the river. Lewis XIV. was born in the new; and the late king James kept his little court in the old, after the Revolution, and died in it September 6th, 1701. The fore&s;t and park, contiguous to the ca&s;tles, are very beautiful.</P>
<P>St. Cyr, a convent of nuns of the order of St. Augu&s;tine, founded, in 1686, by Madame Mainte|non, mi&s;tre&s;s of Lewis XIV. It is a very &s;pacious and &s;plendid &s;tructure, and contains fifty ladies of quality, and two hundred and fifty pupils or young ladies; for in&s;tructing of whom, in every branch of education becoming their rank and &s;ex, there are thirty-&s;ix lay-&s;i&s;ters. The revenue of this foundation is about an hundred and eighty thou&s;and livres. The young ladies continue until they are twenty, when they may either take the veil, or marry, or return to their relations: if they marry, they have
<PB N="105" REF="1060">
a portion of four hundred pi&s;toles; and if they chu&s;e to be nuns, they are admitted into the royal abbies gratis. The vacancies among the fifty la|dies are filled up from among the pupils.</P>
<P>Poi&s;&s;y, a little town, &s;ituated on the Seine, over which it has a large and beautiful bridge of &s;tone. Here, on Thur&s;days, is a famous market for cat|tle. A conference was held, in 1561, betwixt the papi&s;ts and prote&s;tants in this city, but without ef|fect; the famous Beza arguing for the prote&s;tants. Here al&s;o St. Lewis, king of France, was born. The town contains &s;everal churches and convents, with a &s;alt-office.</P>
<P>Meudon, a large open town, two leagues below Paris. Here is a fine royal palace, which was the favourite re&s;idence of the only &s;on of Lewis XIV. and &s;tands in the mid&s;t of a fore&s;t. It is adorned with rich furniture, marble &s;tatues, and fine pic|tures of Roman emperors and antient philo&s;ophers. From the terraces there is a fine view of the coun|try round Paris, together with the cour&s;e of the Seine.</P>
<P>Dourdan, a town &s;ituated on the river Orge, two or three leagues from E&s;tampes, to the we&s;t, and famous for its manufacture of &s;ilk and woollen &s;tockings.</P>
<P>Mont-Lehery, a little town, &s;ix leagues from Paris.</P>
<P>Melun, an antient town, &s;ituated on the river Seine, about eight leagues above Paris to the &s;outh-ea&s;t, part of which &s;tands upon an i&s;land in the Seine, and is joined to the re&s;t by two bridges. It carries on a trade with Paris in corn, wine, flour, and chee&s;e, and contains &s;everal churches and con|vents, with a &s;alt-magazine.</P>
<P>Fountainbleau, a town in the middle of a fore&s;t, one league from the Seine, and eleven from Paris
<PB N="106" REF="1070">
to the &s;outh. It is of note chiefly for a royal ca&s;tle or palace, which is very &s;pacious, but lies in a bot|tom. The fore&s;t is very large, and abounds with game, &s;prings, and hills, covered with naked crag|gy rocks, &s;o that it is very romantic. Here the king often takes the diver&s;ion of hunting. That called the &s;tag-gallery, running along the orangery at Fountainbleau, is decorated with paintings of all the royal palaces and &s;eats, between which are &s;tags heads, and under each head an in&s;cription, &s;hewing in what wood, and by what king, the &s;tag was kill|ed. The gardens are all very beautiful, being adorned with &s;tatues and fountains.</P>
<P>Nemours, a little town, &s;ituated between the fo|re&s;ts of Fountainbleau and Montargis, on the ri|ver Loing, about twelve leagues from Paris to the &s;outh, and belonging to the duke of Orleans. It contains &s;everal convents and churches. Its trade con&s;i&s;ts in corn, wine, flour, and chee&s;e, which they &s;ell in the adjacent villages, or &s;end to Paris by the Seine.</P>
<P>Courtnay, a &s;mall town on the Brook-Clairy, &s;ix|teen leagues from Paris to the &s;outh, which gave name to the illu&s;trious hou&s;e of Courtnay, a branch of which came into England with William the Conqueror, and founded the family of that name, which &s;till &s;ub&s;i&s;ts here.</P>

<HEAD>The GOVERNMENT of PICARDY and ARTOIS.</HEAD>
<P>This government produces wine and grain, with fruits of all kinds, and plenty of hay, e&s;pecially along the Oi&s;e, but wood is &s;carce; for which rea&s;on the people burn turf, except in the Boulon|nois,
<PB N="107" REF="1080">
where they have pit-coal. Picardy, the name of which is thought to be derived from Pi|card, &s;ignifying a pa&s;&s;ionate wrangler, is bounded on the ea&s;t by Champagne; on the &s;outh by the I&s;le of France; on the north by the Pais de Calais, Artois, and Hainault; and on the we&s;t by Nor|mandy and the channel. Its rivers are the Somme, which ri&s;es in the Vermandois, and falls into the channel; the Oi&s;e, in Latin I&s;ara, which ri&s;es in Picardy, and at Conflans, falls into the Seine; and the Canche, which ri&s;es in Artois, and falls into the &s;ea at Staples. The other &s;maller rivers are, the Lauthie, the La Lis, the Aa, the Scarpe, and the Deule. This province, in con&s;equence of its flouri&s;hing manufactures, its &s;ituation upon the &s;ea, and its fi&s;heries, is the &s;eat of a very exten&s;ive trade. Like mo&s;t of the other provinces, it had formerly its petty princes, dependent, however, on the crown of France. For the admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice here are many inferior courts &s;ubordinate to the parliament of Paris. That part of the province which is annexed to the government of the I&s;le of France, con&s;i&s;ting of the Beauvai&s;ois, Noyonnois, Laonnois, and Soi&s;&s;onnois, hath been already de|&s;cribed. In that part which lies within this govern|ment the principal places are,</P>
<P>Gui&s;e, the capital of the di&s;trict of Thierache, &s;tanding on the Oi&s;e, towards the borders of Hai|nault, twenty-&s;ix leagues from Paris to the north-we&s;t. It has a &s;trong ca&s;tle, and gives name to a duchy and peerage, belonging to the hou&s;e of Bourbon-Cond&eacute;. The duchy is very large, and the town, being &s;ituated on the frontiers of the Low-Countries, is regarded as one of the bulwarks of the kingdom, and con&s;equently &s;trongly for|tified.</P>
<P>La Fere, a little town near the conflux of the Saar and Oi&s;e, &s;ix leagues from Gui&s;e to the &s;outh.
<PB N="108" REF="1090">
By the &s;luices, on the Oi&s;e, the adjacent country may be laid under water for &s;everal miles. Here are two churches and two convents, a ca&s;tle, a &s;alt-office, an ar&s;enal, a powder-mill, with a foun|dery, and barracks; and, in the neighbourhood, are &s;everal gla&s;s-hou&s;es, particularly at St. Gobin, where very large plates of looking-gla&s;s are ca&s;t, and afterwards poli&s;hed at the Gobelins.</P>
<P>St. Quentin, a con&s;iderable town on the Somme, twenty-five miles from Paris to the north. The collegiate church is dedicated to St. Quentin, from whom the town takes its name, and is one of the fine&s;t in France. In 1557 a battle was fought here betwixt the French and Spaniards, called the battle of St. Quentin, in which the French were defeated. The chief trade of this place is in lawn, for the ma|nufacture of which the town and its neighbour|hood are noted. It is the capital of the di&s;trict of Vermandois, which was &s;o called from the Vero|mandui, from whom the town was al&s;o formerly denominated Augu&s;ta Veromanduorum.</P>
<P>Peronne, a little but very &s;trong town, on the river Somme, twenty-five leagues from Paris to the north. Though often be&s;ieged it was never taken, for which rea&s;on the French call it La Pu|celle, the Maiden. The town is very antient, con|tains &s;everal churches and convents, and is the ca|pital of the di&s;trict called Santerre. Great quan|tities of linen are made in the neighbouring coun|try.</P>
<P>Mondidier, a &s;trong town, four leagues from Pe|ronne to the &s;outh.</P>

Here are al&s;o three bridges over as many channels of the Somme, a great many churches, be&s;ides the cathedral, &s;everal convents, ho&s;pitals, and manufactures, with an academy of the arts and &s;ciences. Voiture, Rohault, and many other eminent men, were natives of this town. The ramparts make a fine walk, being planted with a double row of trees.</P>
<P>Conti, a &s;mall town about five leagues from Amiens, which gives the title of prince to a branch of the hou&s;e of Bourbon.</P>
<P>Corbie, a little town, four leagues above Amiens to the north-ea&s;t, noted for its abbey, the abbot of which is &s;piritual and temporal lord of the town. A colony from this abbey, founded that of Corvey in We&s;tphalia.</P>
<P>Abbeville, the capital of the di&s;trict of Ponthien, &s;ituated about five leagues from the Briti&s;h chan|nel, thirteen from Boulogne, and &s;even from Amiens, on the Somme, in which the tide ri&s;es here to the height of about &s;ix feet. There are a great many churches and convents in this town, with &s;everal courts and offices, a flouri&s;hing trade, and a variety of manufactures. The woollen cloths made here are &s;aid not to be greatly inferior to the Engli&s;h and Dutch. Abbeville took its name from the abbey of St. Requier, having been formerly only a manor belonging to that abbey.</P>
<P>Cre&s;&s;y, a &s;mall place on the river Authie, three or four leagues from Abbeville, of note only for the battle betwixt the Engli&s;h and French, anno 1346, in which the latter were-totally defeated.</P>
<P><PB N="110" REF="1110">
Montreuil, a &s;trong town near the river Canche, about three leagues from the Briti&s;h channel, and eight from Abbeville to the north. It contains about five thou&s;and inhabitants, and has a little trade.</P>
<P>St. Valery, a &s;ea-port town at the mouth of the Somme, four leagues below Abbeville, which had its name from an abbey founded in 613, by St. Valery. Though it be very dangerous entering the Somme without a good pilot, yet the trade of this town is very con&s;iderable, both in exportation and importation. A court of admi|ralty is held here.</P>
<P>Azincourt, a village near the river Bre&s;&s;e, where Henry V. king of England, obtained a complete victory over the French, on the 25th of October, 1415. The Engli&s;h lo&s;t only &s;ixteen hundred men; but great numbers of the French were either &s;lain or taken pri&s;oners, and among them &s;everal per&s;ons of di&s;tinction.</P>
<P>Boulogne, in Latin Bonania, or Bononia, a city at the mouth of the little river Liane, &s;even leagues from Calais, thirteen from Abbeville, and eight from the neare&s;t coa&s;t of England. It is the capi|tal of the Boulonois, a di&s;trict which enjoys parti|cular privileges, being exempted from &s;everal taxes, and having a governor independent of the governor-general of Picardy. The harbour, which is de|fended by a fort, cannot be entered but at high|water, and not even then without danger and diffi|culty. The road too is dangerous, unle&s;s in calm weather, and when the wind is betwixt the north and &s;outh-ea&s;t points. The town is divided into the upper and lower: the latter, though larger, and hand&s;omer is not &s;o well fortified, nor inhabited by &s;o many per&s;ons of quality as the former. The bi&s;hop of Boulogne is &s;uffragan to the archbi&s;hop of Rheims, and has a revenue of twelve thou&s;and

livres, out of which he pays a tax to the court of Rome of fifteen hundred florins: here is a court of admiralty, and other courts, a &s;trong citadel, and &s;everal convents. The city and its territory was formerly a part of the earldom of Flanders, after|wards it had earls of its own, who were va&s;&s;als, fir&s;t to the counts of Flanders, and then to the counts of Artois. Near it is a mineral &s;pring, called La Fontaine de Fer, that is the Iron-&s;pring.</P>
<P>E&s;taples, a &s;mall town near the mouth of the Canche, five leagues from Boulogne to the &s;outh. Some think it was the Portus Iccius of Cae&s;ar.</P>
<P>Ambleteu&s;e, a &s;mall town on the channel, two leagues from Boulogne to the north, which is well fortified, and has a good harbour. Here king James II. landed, when he fled to France, after his abdication.</P>
<P>Guines, a &s;mall town two leagues from the &s;ea, which gives name to a county in the Pais Reconquis, or Recovered Country.</P>
<P>Andres, a fortified town, three leagues from Calais to the &s;outh. Near this town Francis I. and Henry VIII. of England, had an interview; their retinue was &s;o richly dre&s;&s;ed, that the place, where they met, hath ever &s;ince been called Le Champ de drap d'Or, the Field of the Cloth of Gold.</P>
<P>Calais, a town &s;ituated on the narrowe&s;t part of the channel, oppo&s;ite to Dover, from which it is di&s;tant about &s;even leagues. It is the capital of the Pais Reconquis, or Recovered Country, pretty large, and well fortified, but the harbour is of very difficult and dangerous acce&s;s. Here is a fine ar&s;enal, and a citadel, which commands the town, the harbour, and all the adjacent country, &s;everal convents, and a fort, whence all the country about the town may be laid under water in twenty-four hours. By the canal of Calais, the inhabitants

have an ea&s;y communication with St. Omer, Grave|line, Dunkirk, Bergues, and Ypres. In time of peace, a packet-boat pa&s;&s;es regularly twice a week, betwixt this place and England.</P>
<P>Artois, the other part of this government, is one of the fine&s;t and mo&s;t fertile provinces of the whole kingdom; formerly it was one of the &s;even|teen provinces of the Netherlands, but now be|longs entirely to France. The names of Artois, and Arras, its capital, are derived from the Atre|bates, a people of Gallia Belgica, mentioned by Julius Cae&s;ar. Its greate&s;t length from, north to &s;outh, is about twenty-four leagues, and its breadth about twelve, being bounded to the &s;outh and we&s;t by Picardy, to the ea&s;t by Hainault, and to the north by Flanders. A con&s;iderable trade is carried on in the province in grain, flax, hops, wool, and linen cloth. The &s;tates, who meet re|gularly once a year, con&s;i&s;t of the clergy, nobility, and commoners, and &s;it generally a fortnight at Arras; their chief bu&s;ine&s;s is to deliberate on the ways and means to rai&s;e the money which the king demands of them, and which u&s;ually amounts to about four hundred thou&s;and livres, exclu&s;ive of forage-money. The mo&s;t con&s;iderable places in Artois are,</P>
<P>Arras, the Origiacum of Ptolomy, &s;ituated on the Scarpe, ten leagues from Amiens to the north, &s;ixteen from Dunkirk to the &s;outh, and &s;ix from Cambray to the north-we&s;t.

The inhabitants have a good trade in &s;ail-cloth, and the tape&s;try-hangings, which take their name from the town. Here is held the provincial court of Artois, to which an appeal lies from all the inferior courts, and from that to the parliament of Paris.</P>

<HEAD>The GOVERNMENT of CHAMPAGNE and BRIE.</HEAD>
<P>The province of Champagne is bounded on the north by Hainault and the bi&s;hopric of Liege; on the &s;outh by Burgundy; on the ea&s;t by Luxem|burg and Lorrain; and on the we&s;t by the I&s;le of France and Picardy, being in length about one hundred and &s;ixty five miles, and in breadth from one hundred and twenty to forty-five. Its princi|pal rivers are the Seine, the Marne, the Aube, and the Ai&s;ne. The Maes al&s;o has its &s;ource in this province, but &s;oon runs out of it into the duchy of Bar, whence it returns again; and after pa&s;&s;ing by Sedan and Charleville, and traver&s;ing the Au&s;trian and United Netherlands, falls into the &s;ea near the Briel. The air of this province is very whole&s;ome, and though it does not produce much wheat, yet is noted for its wine, rye, large plains, and rich pa&s;tures: in &s;ome places al&s;o there are mines of iron and other metals, mineral waters, and fore&s;ts, abounding with game. Cham|pagne derives its name from its exten&s;ive plains, and its trade con&s;i&s;ts chiefly in corn, wine, and iron: it was conquered, with the re&s;t of Gaul, by Julius Cae&s;ar; and after the declen&s;ion of the Roman empire, had its earls or counts, who were ab&s;olute &s;overeigns of it, and governed it till the year 1274, when it was annexed by marriage to the crown of France: the whole of it is under the ju|ri&s;diction of the parliament of Paris, except the territory of Sedan, which belongs to that of Metz.

<HEAD>The GOVERNMENT of BURGUNDY.</HEAD>
<P>This government, be&s;ides the duchy of Bur|gundy, contains La Bre&s;&s;e, La Bugy, and the di&s;trict of Gex; having Champagne on the north, Lyonnois on the &s;outh, Franche-Comt&eacute; on the ea&s;t, and Nivernois and Bourbonnois on the we&s;t. Its length from north to &s;outh is about forty-five leagues, and its breadth from ea&s;t to we&s;t about thirty. It is very fertile in corn, wine, fruit, and tobacco; being watered by the Seine, the Dehune, which falls into the Soane, the Brebince, or Bour|bince, the Armancon, the Ouche, and the Tille. There are &s;ome noted mineral &s;prings in it, with &s;ubterraneous lakes, and plenty of ochre. For a long time it had dukes of its own, &s;ubordinate to the crown of France; but Lewis XI. at la&s;t, upon the failure of heirs male, &s;eized upon it, and an|nexed it to his crown. The whole government lies within the juri&s;diction of the parliament of Bur|gundy, except a &s;mall part, that is &s;ubject to that of Paris. The &s;tates meet regularly every three years, to rai&s;e the &s;ums required of them by the court: but the country of Charolois and Macon|nois have their particular &s;tates; and the princi|pality of Dombes is independent of this govern|ment, though it lies within its circuit. The prin|cipal places in the &s;everal parts thereof are,</P>

<HEAD>The GOVERNMENT of DAUPHINE.</HEAD>
<P>Dauphin&eacute; is bounded on the &s;outh by Provence; on the north by Bre&s;&s;e and the Rhone; on the ea&s;t by the Alps and Savoy; and on the we&s;t by the Rhone, which &s;eparates it from the Lyonnois and Languedoc. It had long princes of its own, who were &s;tiled dauphins du Viennois. At la&s;t Dauphin Humbert, having no children, made it over to Philip VI. of France, on condition that the inhabitants &s;hould &s;till retain their privileges, that the province &s;hould be for ever incorporated with the crown of France, and that the king's elde&s;t &s;on &s;hould enjoy it, with the arms and title of dauphin. In the year 1349 this agreement was fully execu|ted. Near two-thirds of the province are very bar|ren and mountainous; but the mountains contain a variety of minerals, and in &s;ome places are co|vered with larch-trees, which are very valuable, as they not only yield a very durable wood, but al&s;o manna benzoin, and agaric, the la&s;t of which is u&s;ed in phy&s;ic and dying &s;carlet. The more level and more fruitful part of the province is called Lower Dauphin&eacute;. On the mountains are al&s;o found &s;everal &s;orts of wild animals, as bears, mar|mots, chamois goats, and another &s;pecies of goats, called by the French bouquettons, or chevrels, together with white hares, partridges, eagles,
<PB N="126" REF="1270">
hawks, &amp;c. The principal rivers are the Rhone, the Durance, the I&s;ere, and the Drome. There are &s;everal mineral &s;prings and natural curio&s;ities in Dauphin&eacute;, of which we &s;hall take &s;ome farther notice in our particular de&s;cription of the province. Dauphin&eacute; is rather a particular &s;tate than a pro|vince, incorporated with the re&s;t of the kingdom. It has its governor and parliament, and is divided into Upper and Lower, in which the mo&s;t noted places are,</P>
<P>Grenoble, the capital, &s;ituated at the conflux of the I&s;ere and Drac. It was antiently called Gratiano|polis, from the emperor Gratian, which at la&s;t was corrupted into Grenoble. Here the parliament of the province &s;its, and here the governor and lieu|tenant general re&s;ide. The town is plea&s;ant, po|pulous, and well-fortified, and the &s;ee of a bi&s;hop, who is &s;uffragan to the archbi&s;hop of Vienne, and has a revenue of twenty-eight thou&s;and livres per annum, out of which he pays a taxation to Rome of one thou&s;and florins. Here are manufactures of coar&s;e woollen &s;tuffs, &s;kins, gloves, with an ar&s;enal, a citadel, a general ho&s;pital, and a fine epi&s;|copal palace, and another, in which the courts of ju&s;tice are held. Three leagues from the city, a|mong the Alps, lies a famous mona&s;tery of Carthu|&s;ians, called by the French, La grande Chartreu&s;e, becau&s;e it is the fir&s;t of that order, founded by St. Bruno. The &s;ituation and pro&s;pect are very ro|mantic, the mona&s;tery &s;tanding high, amid&s;t mountains, woods, and rocks. Near it is the vil|lage Carthreu&s;e, from which the order derived its name. Strangers that vi&s;it the convent are enter|tained gratis. Here the general of the order is cho&s;en, and re&s;ides during life. About three leagues from Grenoble is a piece of ground that emits &s;moak, and &s;ometimes &s;mall flames; and at the di&s;tance of one league are the caves of Sa&s;&s;en|age,
<PB N="127" REF="1280">
and a grotto, in which is a water-fall. Here al&s;o among the gravel in the &s;prings are found a &s;ort of precious &s;tones, &s;ome white, &s;ome of a dark grey colour, very &s;mooth, and of a fine lu&s;tre. Tho&s;e of the &s;ize and &s;hape of a lin-&s;eed are not only the be&s;t, but being dropt into the eye, they expel all impurities, without injuring it in the lea&s;t. About five leagues from Grenoble is the mineral &s;pring of La Mothe, the waters of which are pretty hot, and highly e&s;teemed as a certain re|medy for all di&s;orders of the &s;tomach, fluxes, and even lamene&s;s.</P>

<P>This principality, which is about four French leagues in length, and two in breadth, had for|merly counts and princes of its own; but, in the year 1531, it came to the hou&s;e of Na&s;&s;au, in which it continued till the death of William-Henry, prince of Orange, &s;tadtholder of Holland, and king of Great Britain. In the year 1713, Frederic-William, king of Pru&s;&s;ia, and one of king Wil|liam's heirs, ceded it to France; and, in 1722, Lewis XV. gave it to the prince of Conti.

<HEAD>The GOVERNMENT of PROVENCE.</HEAD>
<P>This county derives its name from the Latin Provincia, and is bounded to the &s;outh by the Me|diterranean; to the north by Dauphin&eacute;; to the we&s;t by the Rhone, which &s;eparates it from Lan|guedoc; and to the ea&s;t by the Alps and the Var, which divides it from the dominions of the king of
<PB N="131" REF="1320">
Sardinia. It is divided into the Upper and Lower, its length being about forty-two French leagues, and its breadth about thirty. The air and &s;oil dif|fer widely in the two divi&s;ions; for in the former the air is temperate, but, in the latter, &s;o hot that it would be intolerable, e&s;pecially upon the &s;ea|coa&s;t, were it not qualified by certain winds. The former yields good corn, apples, and pears, and abounds in cattle, but has little wine. On the con|trary, the latter has plenty of wine, with orange, le|mon, pomegranate, fig, palm, cypre&s;s, olive, ma&s;tic, medlar, and &s;ea cherry trees; but does not produce half the quantity of corn nece&s;&s;ary for the inhabi|tants: this province yields al&s;o a kind of box, the fruit of which proceeds from the middle of the leaf, and continues all the year round. Of their wines, the mu&s;cadel is the be&s;t. In the road and harbour of Toulon is caught a fi&s;h, inclo&s;ed in a &s;tone, which mu&s;t be broke before the fi&s;h can be come at, and called a date, from its re&s;emblance to that fruit. The ta&s;te of it is very agreeable; but, in ge|neral, the fi&s;h of the Mediterranean are inferior to tho&s;e of the Ocean. There is al&s;o a &s;mall bird in this province, called becca-&s;igo, that feeds only upon grapes and figs, and is delicate eating. Iron, black agate, and even gold, copper, and lead, are &s;aid to be found here. There are no con&s;iderable rivers in the province: the chief are, the Du|rance, the Sourge, the Largens, (&s;o called from the tran&s;parency of its waters) the Lare, the Ver|don, and the Var; the la&s;t of which divides France from Italy. The woods here are numerous, and afford a great deal of timber for &s;hipping, and other u&s;es. Provence has its parliament and &s;tates; but in&s;tead of the latter, general a&s;&s;emblies are now &s;ummoned every year, by the king's order, to make a repartition of the &s;ub&s;idies demanded of the pro|vince. Almo&s;t the whole trade from France to

Italy, and the Levant, and the greater part of that to Spain, is carried on from this province. The balance of trade to Italy is &s;aid to be two hundred thou&s;and livres in favour of that country; but of that to Spair, the balance is greatly in favour of France. The exportations and importations, to and from the Levant, are very great; that trade, it is &s;aid, employing above a hundred ve&s;&s;els, of one &s;ort or another. Provence had long counts of its own; but, in the year 1481, it fell to Lewis XI. &s;ince which time it hath continued annexed to the crown of France. The places of mo&s;t note in it are,</P>

<P>Avignon, with its di&s;trict, antiently belonged to the counts of Tholou&s;e and Provence; afterwards, they fell to the dukes of Burgundy; then they were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the kings of Sicily, who were al&s;o counts of Provence, until the year 1348, that Johanna queen of Sicily, and counte&s;s of Provence, di&s;po&s;ed of the town and its di&s;trict to pope Cle|ment VI. for eighty thou&s;and florins. The di&s;trict is very fruitful, and abounds in corn, wine, and &s;affron. As for the county of Venai&s;&s;in, it was held either by the counts of Tholou&s;e, its own counts, or the emperors, until the year 1273; &s;ince which it hath been po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the popes, and governed, under them, by officers called rec|tores. It is al&s;o very fruitful. The only place worth mentioning in the di&s;trict of Avignon, is that which gives name to it, viz.</P>

<P>Languedoc is bounded to the &s;outh by the Me|diterranean, and the counties of Rou&s;&s;illon and Foix; to the north by Guienne, Lyonnois, and Au|vergne; to the ea&s;t by the Rhone, which parts it from Dauphin&eacute;, Provence, and Avignon. It is of a very irregular figure, but its greate&s;t length is about &s;eventy French leagues, and its breadth from ten to thirty-two. After the Romans, the Vi&s;i-Goths
<PB N="141" REF="1420">
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed them&s;elves of this province, and held it, until they were expelled by the Saracens; who were, in their turn, obliged to quit it by the Franks, under Charles Martel, and his &s;on Pepin: after that it was governed, as mo&s;t of the other pro|vinces, by dukes, vi&s;counts, and other lords, &s;ub|ordinate to the crown of France; until, at la&s;t, it was united to that crown, anno 1316. The pro|vinces lying &s;outh of the Loire, formerly u&s;ing the &s;yllable oc, in&s;tead of oui, gave occa&s;ion to tho&s;e provinces being di&s;tingui&s;hed by the name of the country of the Langued'oc; and tho&s;e to the north of the Loire, by that of the country of Langue|d'oui: but, at la&s;t, the di&s;tinction being confined to this province, it got from thence the name of Languedoc. Though &s;ome parts of the pro|vince are mountainous, particularly the Cevennes, yet, in general, it is very fruitful in grain, wine, fruits, oil, &s;affron, and woad. There is al&s;o plenty of honey, wax, &s;ilk, &s;alt, good pa&s;ture for oxen and cows, with &s;ome rich mines of metals and minerals, quarries of marble and alaba&s;ter, &s;prings of mineral waters, and both &s;ea and river fi&s;h. The Cevennes yield millet, che&s;nuts, and &s;ome other fruits. The air is remarkably plea&s;ant and healthful, e&s;pecially in the higher parts of the country. The principal rivers are the Rhone, the Garonne, the Aude, the Tarne, the Allier, and the Loire. The royal ca|nal of Languedoc, which was begun and completed betwixt the years 1660 and 1686, in order to open a communication betwixt the Ocean and the Me|diterranean, without going about by the &s;treights of Gibraltar, begins at Cette, on the Mediterranean, and, a quarter of a mile below Tholou&s;e, joins the Garonne, which falls into the bay of Bi&s;cay. It is upwards of an hundred miles in length, &s;ix feet deep every where, and the breadth generally above twenty fathom. In &s;ome places it is carried
<PB N="142" REF="1430">
under mountains, and in others over vallies; having all along &s;luices, dams, re&s;ervoirs, water-cour&s;es, and draw-bridges. It is &s;aid to have co&s;t thirteen millions of livres; part of which was furni&s;hed by the king, and part by the &s;tates of Languedoc. The whole management and produce of it were granted, by the king, to Riquet, who contrived and executed it, and his male-heirs. Ships pa&s;&s;ing on it pay twenty &s;ous for every hundred-weight. The counts of Caraman, de&s;cended from Riquet, are obliged to keep it in repair, and to have pa&s;&s;age|boats, to go and come at &s;tated times, with or without pa&s;&s;engers. Several remarkable winds are ob&s;erved in this province. That called the cers, from the Latin circius or cercius, blows generally from the we&s;t along the &s;outhern coa&s;t, and is very refre&s;hing in &s;ummer: another called autan, and in Latin altanus, blows generally from the oppo&s;ite quarter, and is hot and unwhole&s;ome: a third, called bi&s;e or the black, and by Strabo melambo|reas, or the black north-wind, blows frequently in the valley, through which the Rhone runs, very &s;trong and cold. When the wind in this valley blows from the &s;outh, unattended with rain, it is no le&s;s unwhole&s;ome than the autun. From the coa&s;ts of Leucate to the Rhone, in the heat of &s;um|mer, a &s;ea breeze &s;ets in, from ten in the forenoon to five in the afternoon, which cools the air, that would be otherwi&s;e almo&s;t in&s;upportable. In a valley at the foot of the Pyrenees, there is a &s;harp we&s;t or north-we&s;t wind, called the le vent de pas, which blows only in the night, and generally, in the &s;ummer, through the openings of the mountains: hence the people of the valley are obliged to win|now their corn in the night. A very remarkable cu&s;tom prevails in this province, namely, that of treading out their corn by hor&s;es or mules, accord|ing to the Ea&s;tern cu&s;tom, frequently alluded to in

The &s;tates of the province con&s;i&s;t of three orders, the clergy, nobility, and the com|mons, who meet every year in October; and no tax can be impo&s;ed without the king's letters-pa|tent, and the previous deliberation of the &s;tates thereupon. Be&s;ides the general a&s;&s;emblies of the &s;tates of Languedoc, there are particular a&s;&s;emblies of the &s;tates of Vivarez, Velay, and Gevaudan. The coa&s;ts of Languedoc are &s;aid to be not only dangerous, but de&s;titute of &s;afe and good harbours. The exports con&s;i&s;t chiefly of wine, oil, dried che&s;|nuts, rai&s;ins, woollen cloth, &s;tuffs, &s;ilk, and corn in a good year. For the government of the pro|vince and the admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice, be&s;ides the &s;tates, here is a parliament, a chamber of accounts and taxes, a governor-general, and three lieutenant-generals, &s;ubordinate to whom are nine other go|vernors of particular places.

Its name is derived from its antient capital Ru&s;cino, which was a Roman colony. The heat here in &s;ummer is very inten&s;e, and the inhabitants, in con&s;equence thereof, very meagre and &s;warthy: the &s;oil is very fruitful in corn, wine, oil, and hay; but produces little wood, which they are obliged to import on the backs of mules, having no navigable rivers: they plow the ground al&s;o with mules, and &s;ow a great deal of millet. Orange-trees abound here, and &s;heep, who&s;e fle&s;h is excellent, as is al&s;o that of their pi|geons, quails, and partridges; but the milk of their cows is not good, and therefore they keep but few, either of them or oxen.

<P>This government is bounded to the ea&s;t by Bigorre, to the we&s;t by Labourd, to the &s;outh by the Pyrenean mountains, and to the north by Ga&s;|cogne. Navarre, included in this government, and called Lower Navarre, is but a &s;mall part of the antient kingdom of Navarre, which having been &s;eized by Ferdinand king of Arragon and Ca|&s;tile, this part alone was re&s;tored to Catherine the true heire&s;s, from whom it de&s;cended at la&s;t to the hou&s;e of Bourbon, and was annexed in 1620 to the crown of France. It is about eight leagues in length, and five in breadth. The principality of Bearn came to the crown of France at the &s;ame time, and in the &s;ame manner, as Navarre. Both of the&s;e countries have their &s;tates, and both lie within the juri&s;diction of the parliament of Pau. Navarre is a barren mountainous country, and the only places in it worth mentioning are, St. Jean Pi&eacute; de port and St. Palais. The former is the ca|pital of the country, and &s;tands on the river Nive, a league from the borders of Spain, and eight from Bayonne. It is pretty well fortified, and has a

<P>The principality of Bearn lies at the foot of the Pyrenean mountains, being about &s;ixteen leagues in length, and twelve in breadth. In general it is but a barren country, yet the plains yield con&s;ide|rable quantities of flax, and a kind of Indian corn, called Mailloc. The&s;e mountains are rich in mines of iron, copper, and lead; &s;ome of them al&s;o are covered with vines, and others with pine trees, and they give ri&s;e to &s;everal mineral &s;prings, and two con&s;iderable rivers, the one called the Gave of Oleron, and the other the Gave of Bearn. Some wine is exported from this country, and the Spaniards buy up great numbers of hor&s;es and cat|tle, together with mo&s;t of their linen, of which there is a con&s;iderable manufactory. The places of mo&s;t note in the principality are,</P>
<P>Pau, in Latin Palum, a &s;mall but well-built town on the Gave of Bearn, above twenty leagues from Bayonne to the ea&s;t, and about ten from the frontier of Spain.

<HEAD>The GOVERNMENT of GUYENNE and GASCONY.</HEAD>
<P>This government, which is the large&s;t of any in France, being about one hundred and ninety-five miles in its greate&s;t length from ea&s;t to we&s;t, and one hundred and &s;ixty-eight in breadth from north to &s;outh, is bounded on the &s;outh by the Pyrenean mountains, which &s;eparate it from Spain; on the north by Saintonge, Angoumois, and Limou&s;in; on the ea&s;t by Auvergne and Languedoc; and on the we&s;t by the ocean. The name of Guyenne is a corruption of that of Aquitain; but under the lat|ter name a much greater extent of country was antiently comprehended than is now under the former. It is &s;aid to have had the name of Aqui|tain from the mineral waters in it. Henry II. of England &s;ucceeded to the duchy of Aquitain in right of his wife Eleanor, and his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors con|tinued almo&s;t in the uninterrupted po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it till the time of Henry VI. in who&s;e reign the Eng|li&s;h lo&s;t not only this, but mo&s;t of the other terri|tories they held in France. Both Guyenne and Ga&s;cony are fruitful in corn, wine, fruits, hemp,
<PB N="158" REF="1590">
tobacco, brandy, prunes, and many other com|modities. They have al&s;o medicinal &s;prings, with copper, coal, and other mines, and quarries of marble of all colours. Their chief rivers are the Garonne, in which the tide flows up thirty leagues, and the Adour, both which di&s;charge them&s;elves into the ocean. They are partly under the juri&s;|diction of the parliament of Tholou&s;e, and partly under that of Bourdeaux, and contain two gene|ralities, and thirteen bailiwics. Guyenne, properly &s;o called, is bounded on the north by Saintonge; on the ea&s;t by Perigord and Agenois; on the &s;outh by Bazadois and Ga&s;cony; and on the we&s;t by the ocean; and contains the following places of note, viz.</P>
<P>Bourdeaux, the capital of the whole govern|ment. The neighbouring di&s;trict, called Bourde|lois, is very fruitful, particularly in vines, che&s;nuts, and fig-trees. The city &s;tands on the banks of the Garonne, about twenty leagues from its mouth, and is one of the mo&s;t antient and faire&s;t in France. It carries on a great trade with mo&s;t parts of Europe, the tide ri&s;ing &s;o high in the river, that &s;hips of great burden can come up to the key.

<HEAD>The GOVERNMENT of BRITANNY.</HEAD>
<P>The province of Britanny is a penin&s;ula, &s;ur|rounded on all &s;ides by the &s;ea, except towards the ea&s;t, where it borders on Normandy, Maine, An|jou, and Poitou. It is a very large province, ex|tending about &s;ixty leagues where longe&s;t, and about forty-five, where broade&s;t. It had its pre|&s;ent name from the Britons, who fled hither from the Saxons in the fifth century, and, after wander|ing about for &s;ome time, at la&s;t &s;ettled here. Be|fore that, it had the name of Armorica, i. e. ad Mare Sita, from its lying along the &s;ea-coa&s;t. After the declen&s;ion of the Roman empire, it had kings, or counts and dukes of its own, until Ann of Bre|tagne, the only daughter of Francis II. the la&s;t duke, married Charles VIII. and afterwards Lewis XII. and thereby annexed it to the dominions of France. The only navigable rivers are the Loire, and the Vilaine. In Upper-Britanny are pretty high mountains. No great quantity of grain or wine is produced in the province, but good pa&s;turage, flax, and hemp, with &s;ome lead, pit|coal, wood, and &s;alt. On the &s;ea coa&s;t are many good harbours, plenty of excellent fi&s;h, fi&s;hermen, and &s;eamen. The hor&s;es bred here are much valued, and the butter is excellent. Towards the &s;ea-coa&s;ts, the air is not &s;o pure and whole&s;ome as in the in|terior parts. The province has its own parlia|ment, governor, and &s;tates; the la&s;t of which, con|&s;i&s;ting of the clergy, nobility, burghers, and pea|&s;ants, meet every two years, to rai&s;e the free gift de|manded of them by the king. In Lower-Britanny they &s;peak a different language from that of the re&s;t of France: it has a great affinity with that of Wales, the inhabitants of both countries being de|&s;cended
<PB N="174" REF="1750">

<P>Rennes, the capital, &s;ituated at the conflux of the I&s;le and the Vilaine, above fourteen leagues from the &s;ea, from which, however, large boats come up to it; and eighteen from Nantz to the north.

This town carries on a great trade, though &s;hips of burthen cannot come up to it, and is the &s;ee of a bi&s;hop, &s;uffragan to the archbi&s;hop of Tours, who&s;e revenue amounts to thirty thou&s;and livres per annum, and his taxation to Rome to two thou|&s;and florins. It is famous al&s;o for the edict i&s;&s;ued here, in 1594, by Henry IV. in favour of the pro|te&s;tants; and for an excellent &s;ort of brandy, ex|ported hence into foreign countries. There is a kind of partner&s;hip or league betwixt the merchants of this city, and tho&s;e of Bilboa in Spain.</P>

<HEAD>The GOVERNMENT of NORMANDY.</HEAD>
<P>Normandy is bounded on the &s;outh by Maine, Perche, and Beauce; on the north by the Briti&s;h channel; on the ea&s;t by the i&s;le of France and Pi|cardy; and on the we&s;t by Brittany. Its extent from ea&s;t to we&s;t is about &s;ixty leagues, and from north to &s;outh about thirty. It is very fruitful in corn, flax, hemp, pa&s;turage, and fruits of &s;everal &s;orts, particularly pears and apples, of which a great deal of cyder and perry is made. Here is al&s;o plenty of wood, coals, cattle, madder, and woad, together with fi&s;h, mineral waters, iron, copper, and other metals. Its principal rivers are the Seine, the Eure, the Andelle, the Rille, the Dive, the Lezon, the Carentone, the Aure, the Ante, the Orne, and the Drome. It takes its name from the Normans, who made a conque&s;t of it in the beginning of the tenth century; William

<HEAD>The GOVERNMENT of MAINE and PERCHE.</HEAD>
<P>This government comprehends the province of Maine, together with the country of Laval, and the greate&s;t part of that of Perche. The fir&s;t of the&s;e derives its name from the Cenomani, and is bounded to the ea&s;t by Perche; on the we&s;t by Anjou and Brittany; on the &s;outh by Touraine and Vendomois; and on the north by Normandy. Its
<PB N="185" REF="1860">
greate&s;t length from ea&s;t to we&s;t is about thirty leagues, and its breadth from &s;outh to north twenty. This country, as a part of Normandy, followed the fate of that duchy. It was formerly an earl|dom, but has been united to the crown, ever &s;ince the year 1584; and by Lewis XIV. was erected into a duchy-peerdom, in favour of one of his na|tural &s;ons, whom he legitimated and &s;tiled duke of Maine. It is pretty fruitful in corn, wine, wood, and pa&s;ture; and has al&s;o &s;ome iron-works and mineral waters, with quarries of marble, free-&s;tone, and &s;late. Its principal rivers are the Maienne, the Huine, the Sarte, and the Loire. It is &s;ubject to the parliament of Paris, and the places of mo&s;t note in it are,</P>
<P>Mans, in Latin Cenomonum, the capital of the whole province, &s;ituated on the river Sarte, ten leagues from Alencon, to the north. It is a very antient city, and the &s;ee of a bi&s;hop, who is &s;uffra|gan to Tours, and has a revenue of thirty-five thou&s;and livres, out of which his tax to Rome is two thou&s;and two hundred and &s;ixteen florins.

<P>Laval, in Latin Vallis Guidonis, a town on the river Maienne, twelve leagues from Mans to the we&s;t. It is the capital of a county-peerdom, be|longing to the hou&s;e of Tremouille.</P>
<P>The country of Perche is bounded on the ea&s;t by Timerais and Chartrain; on the we&s;t and north by Normandy; and on the &s;outh by the river Maienne, being about fifteen leagues in length, and twelve in breadth. The u&s;ual drink of the inhabitants is cyder, the province yielding great quantities of ap|ples, but little wine. Cows and &s;heep graze on the mountains, and the plains abound in corn of all &s;orts, flax and hay: there are al&s;o &s;ome iron|mines, and mineral waters in the country. That part of it which belongs to this government, and is by much the greater part, is &s;ubject to the par|liament of Paris, and contains the following places worth mentioning:</P>
<P>Mortagne, in Latin Moritania, the capital of the country, &s;tanding in that called Great Perche, thirteen leagues from Chartres to the we&s;t. Here are &s;everal convents, churches, and courts of judi|cature, with a &s;alt-office, and a manufacture of coar&s;e linen.</P>

<HEAD>The GOVERNMENT of ORLEANOIS.</HEAD>
<P>This government includes the &s;everal di&s;tricts of Orleanois-Proper, Beauce-Proper or Chartrain, Du|nois, Vendomois, Blai&s;ois, the greate&s;t part of Ga|tinois, and Perche-Gouet. The principal rivers in it are the Loire, the Loiret, the Cher, the Laconie, the Aigle, the Hyere, the Yonne, and the Evre. There are al&s;o &s;ome remarkable canals, particularly tho&s;e of Briare and Orleans. The river Loire, and the canals drawn from thence, greatly facili|tate and promote the inland trade of the kingdom, and particularly of this government, which lies en|tirely within the juri&s;diction of the parliament of Paris, and, be&s;ides the chief governor, has &s;everal &s;ubordinate ones.</P>
<P>Orleanois, in Latin Aurelianen&s;is Ager, is bounded on the &s;outh by Sologne, on the north by Upper-Beauce, on the ea&s;t by Gatinois, and on the we&s;t by Dunois and Vendomois. The Loire di|vides it into Upper and Lower; the former ly|ing to the north, and the latter to the &s;outh of that river. It yields plenty of grain, wine, wood, and fruit, and abounds in cattle, game, and fi&s;h. The principal places in it are,</P>
<P>Orleans, from which it derives its name, and is the capital not only of it, but of the whole govern|ment. It was antiently called Genabum or Cena|bum, and afterwards Aurelia, Aureliae, and Au|relianum, and &s;tands twenty leagues from Paris to the &s;outh, on the northern bank of the Loire,
<PB N="188" REF="1890">
over which there is here a fine &s;tone bridge of &s;ixteen arches, leading into a &s;uburb on the &s;outh &s;ide of the river. In Julius Cae&s;ar's time it was the capital of the Carnutes: Aurelian, the emperor, enlarged it, and gave it his name. It is one of the large&s;t cities in the kingdom, but meanly built, and mo&s;t of the inhabitants are poor, tho' there are here &s;everal in|ferior courts of ju&s;tice, with an univer&s;ity, at pre|&s;ent in no great repute; a public library; a &s;tately Gothic cathedral, and a great number of other churches, &s;ome of which are collegiate; a public walk, planted with &s;everal rows of trees; &s;ome &s;u|gar bakers; a manufacture of &s;tockings and &s;heep-&s;kins; a &s;eminary, in which divinity is taught; and a great trade in brandy, wine, &s;pices, and &s;everal manufactures, which, with many other commodities, are conveyed from hence to Paris, and other places, by means of the Loire, and the canal, which takes its name from the city. Some of the trading peo|ple are very rich. The canal begins about two miles above the city, is near eighteen leagues in length, and terminates on the Loing, which falls into the Seine. To the north of the city is a fore&s;t, the large&s;t in the whole kingdom, belonging to the duke of Orleans, to whom the timber felled in it brings in, one year with another, about an hundred thou&s;and livres. Ever &s;ince the year 1344, this city has been a dukedom and peerage, and u&s;ually an appennage of &s;ome prince of the blood. Lewis XIV. gave it to his brother Philip, who begun and fini&s;hed the canal, in who&s;e family it &s;till conti|nues. The duties paid by ve&s;&s;els going up and down the canal, amounts, in &s;ome years, to an hundred and fifty thou&s;and livres. The bi&s;hop of this city is &s;uffragan to the archbi&s;hop of Paris, and has a revenue of twenty-four thou&s;and livres, out of which his tax to Rome is two thou&s;and flo|rins. It is &s;aid, a new bi&s;hop, on the fir&s;t day of

The duke of Orleans is al&s;o duke of Chartres. The grove of the Druids, men|tioned by Cae&s;ar, was on a hill near this town, the chief trade of which is in corn. They &s;hew a well in the cathedral, into which a great many Chri&s;tians are &s;aid to have been thrown by Querinus, the Ro|man procon&s;ul. Below the &s;ame cathedral is ano|ther church, under-ground.

In the ca&s;tle are &s;hewn the cham|bers where the duke of Gui&s;e, and his brother, the cardinal, were murdered, in 1588. The counts of Blois were antiently the mo&s;t powerful lords in France. Four leagues from the town, to the north-ea&s;t, is the royal palace of Chambord, on the little river Ca&s;&s;on, in the middle of a &s;pacious park, well &s;tocked with deer. Its palace is reckoned the fine&s;t piece of Gothic architecture in France, and was built by Francis I. Here Stani&s;laus, the de|throned king of Poland, re&s;ided &s;ome years, and here mar&s;hal Saxe, on whom the king had con|ferred the palace, died, in 1750, as did his heir, the count de Frie&s;e, in 1755.

<HEAD>The GOVERNMENT of AUVERGNE.</HEAD>
<P>The province of Auvergne, which takes its name from the antient inhabitants the Arverni, termi|nates to the &s;outh on Rouergue and the Cevennes; to the north on Bourbonnois; to the we&s;t on Limo|&s;in, Quercy, and La Manche; and to the ea&s;t on Forez. It is divided into Upper and Lower, and extends in length about forty leagues, and in breadth thirty. Lower Auvergne is a very fruit|ful country; and the Upper, though cold and mountainous, yet yields good pa&s;ture, and, in con|&s;equence thereof, breeds a prodigious number of cattle, and makes great quantities of chee&s;e. The

It is &s;aid that the gu&s;ts of wind are &s;o vio|lent and variable among the mountains, that wind|mills cannot be u&s;ed. The principal rivers of the province are the Allier, the Dardogne, and the Alagnon; and its chief manufactures are &s;ilks, &s;tuffs, cloths, laces, iron - works, and paper, in which, and corn, wine, cattle, chee&s;e, and coals, it car|ries on a great trade. It is entirely within the ju|ri&s;diction of the parliament of Paris, and a part of it &s;till enjoys the title of an earldom, and belongs to the hou&s;e of Bouillon.</P>

The counts of Auvergne antiently &s;tiled them&s;elves al&s;o counts of Clermont, that being the capital of their territories, and &s;ometimes the place of their re&s;i|dence. In the neighbourhood of the town are &s;e|veral petrifying &s;prings, one of which, in the &s;u|burb of St. Allire, has formed a &s;olid rock, and a kind of bridge, under which the rivulet of Tiri|taine pa&s;&s;es; yet it is the only drinking water in the &s;uburb, and no ill effects are felt from the u&s;e of it.</P>

<P>Thiers, or Thiern, a con&s;iderable town, &s;ix leagues from Clermont to the ea&s;t. It has the greate&s;t variety of manufactures, and the mo&s;t trade of any town in Auvergne.</P>
<P>Brioude, in Latin, Brivas, a very antient town on the Allier. Here is a very extraordinary bridge, &s;uppo&s;ed to be a work of the Romans, being very long and lofty, but of only one arch, which re&s;ts on two high mountains. The town took its name from its bridge, Briva in the language of the Gauls &s;ignifying a bridge.

<P>Limo&s;in, or Limou&s;in, is bounded on the ea&s;t by Auvergne, on the we&s;t by Perigord and An|goumois, on the &s;outh by Quercy, and on the north by La Marche and Poitou. Its extent from &s;outh to north is about twenty-five leagues, and near as much from ea&s;t to we&s;t. Both it, and its capital Limoges, had their names from the antient Limovices, one of the mo&s;t valiant nations of Gaul. It is divided into Upper and Lower, the former of which is cold and mountainous, pro|ducing little wine, and that too very indifferent; but the latter more warm and fruitful, and pro|ducing very good wine. The country, in gene|ral, abounds with che&s;nuts, which make a great part of the food of the common people: rye, bar|ley, and buck-wheat al&s;o thrive very well in it. With regard to metals, here are mines of lead, tin, copper, iron, and &s;teel; but excepting tho&s;e of iron, the working of them does not turn to ac|count. The native &s;teel found here far excels the artificial. This country is noted al&s;o for its oxen, cows, and hor&s;es, of which great numbers are bought up by the neighbouring provinces. The chief rivers of Limo&s;in are the Vienne, the Vezere, and the Dordogne.

Here al&s;o are &s;everal inferior courts of ju&s;tice, a &s;eminary, an academy of belles lettres, an univer&s;ity, and &s;ome remains of Roman antiquities. The fir&s;t walls of the city were built by John, king of England, and duke of Anjou. The inhabitants are employed chiefly in bleaching wax and linen, refining &s;ugar, and making camblets, &s;erges, and fine woollen &s;tuffs, &s;triped with &s;ilk and gold. It is &s;aid of Angers, that it &s;tands low, has high &s;teeples, rich whores, and poor &s;cholars.</P>
<P>Chateau-Gontier, a pretty large town on the river Maienne, five or &s;ix leagues from Angers. Here is a ca&s;tle, &s;everal churches and convents, with manufactures of linen cloth and &s;erges, and mineral &s;prings.</P>
<P>Pont de S&eacute;, in Latin, Pons Saii, &s;o called from a long bridge over the Loire, on which it &s;tands, about a league and a quarter from Angers to the ea&s;t, having a ca&s;tle, and, in the neighbourhood, quarries of black and white marble, and free&s;tone.

The governor of the town, and of its ca&s;tle and di&s;trict, called Saumu|rois, is independent of the governor of the pro|vince. The town was much more opulent while it was in the hands of the Huguenots.</P>
<P>Doe, or Dou&eacute;, a pretty little town three leagues from Saumur to the we&s;t. The fairs kept here for the &s;ale of cattle are the mo&s;t noted in the whole province. There is al&s;o one of the fine&s;t fountains in France at this place, built in the form of an hor&s;e|&s;hoe.</P>
<P>Bri&s;&s;ac, a little town on the Aubance, two or three leagues from Angers. Here is a fine ca&s;tle, a park, and a pond near a league long. The town was erected into a duchy and peerdom in 1611.</P>

<HEAD>The GOVERNMENT of FRENCH FLANDERS.</HEAD>
<P>THIS government contains the greate&s;t part of the French Netherlands, and is bounded to the north by the Seine and the German ocean, to the &s;outh by Artois, to the ea&s;t by the Au&s;trian Netherlands, and to the we&s;t by the German ocean. The French Netherlands con&s;i&s;t of a part of the duchy of Luxemburg, of the province of Hai|nault, of the earldom of Flanders, the bi&s;hopric of Liege, the Cambre&s;is, and the county of Namur; and this government, the greate&s;t part of which belongs to the parliament of Douay, comprehends French Flanders, the Cambre&s;is, French Hainault, and the French part of the earldom of Namur.</P>
<P>French Flanders abounds in grain, vegetables, flax, and cattle, but is in want of wood, and the principal places in it are,</P>
<P>Li&s;le or Lille, in Latin In&s;ula or I&s;la, the capital not only of French Flanders, but of all the French Netherlands, &s;ituated on the river Deule, twenty-three miles from Arras to the north, twelve from Tournay to the we&s;t, and &s;ixteen from Ypres to the &s;outh. The French fir&s;t got po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it, in the reign of Philip the Fair; afterwards, it belonged to the dukes of Burgundy; then to the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria, in who&s;e po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion it continued till 1667; when Lewis XIV. made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of it, and &s;everal other places in Flanders.

There is always a &s;trong garri&s;on in Li&s;le, which, be&s;ides its &s;hare of the other duties and taxes, pays yearly a con&s;iderable &s;um towards keep|ing the fortifications in repair.</P>
<P>Douay, a pretty large and well fortified town, with a citadel, &s;ituated on the river Scarpe, and the borders of Artois, &s;ixteen miles from Li&s;le to the &s;outh, among mar&s;hes. By means of &s;luices, the whole country round may be laid under water. Here are &s;everal churches; a famous &s;eminary for Engli&s;h Roman catholics; an univer&s;ity, founded in 1559; and a parliament, which has mo&s;t of the French Netherlands under its juri&s;diction.</P>
<P>Gravelines, a &s;mall but &s;trong town, on the river Aa, about nine miles from Dunkirk, and one from the &s;ea. It is well fortified, and has a &s;ort of har|bour at the mouth of the river.</P>

<P>The Cambre&s;is is about ten leagues long, and from five to &s;ix where broade&s;t, has &s;tates of its own, and is very fruitful and populous. The prin|cipal places are,</P>
<P>Cambray or Camerick, the capital, &s;eated on the Scheld, thirteen miles from Douay to the &s;outh. It was taken by Lewis XIV. in 1677, and next year was yielded to him by the treaty of Nime|guen, together with the whole Cambre&s;is.

Part of it is in the dioce&s;e of Cambray, and part in that of Arras. The manufactures here are woollen &s;tuffs, camblets, barracans, and a &s;ort of fine lawns called bati&s;te, in French. A court is appointed every year by the magi&s;trates, for deter|mining all matters relative to the manufactures. There are al&s;o certain officers here, and in other towns in the French Netherlands, called appai&s;ers, or peace-makers; becau&s;e their province is to make up all differences and quarrels among pri|vate per&s;ons, which are not con&s;iderable enough to

Lewis XIV. cau&s;ed it to be &s;trongly fortified, and a harbour to be con|&s;tructed capable of receiving men of war, which was al&s;o fortified. In pur&s;uance of an article of the treaty of Utrecht, all the&s;e fortifications, together with the moles and Fort Lewis, were demoli&s;hed, and the harbour filled up. However, both the fortifications and the harbour were afterwards repaired: but, by
<PB N="218" REF="2190">
the la&s;t treaty of peace concluded between France and England, and their re&s;pective allies, it was ex|pre&s;sly &s;tipulated, that all the fortifications &s;hould be again demoli&s;hed, and the harbour filled up; but whether this article hath yet been executed, in its full extent, is what we will not venture to af|firm. The town hath declined greatly in con&s;e|quence of the&s;e &s;tipulations.</P>
<P>The only other place worth mentioning in this government is Mardyke, a village about three miles to the we&s;t of Dunkirk, celebrated on ac|count of the noble canal erected there, with its &s;luice and ba&s;ons, by order of Lewis XIV. after the peace of Utrecht; but, by virtue of an article of the treaty concluded at the Hague, in 1717, this canal hath been rendered, in a great mea&s;ure, u&s;ele&s;s.</P>

The city is divided into the Old and New, both of which are large and hand&s;ome; but the latter ex|ceeds the former, at lea&s;t, in re&s;pect of beauty. The number of the inhabitants is above twenty thou&s;and. The Jews are confined to a particular quarter, along the bank of the Mo&s;elle, in which they may not only hire, but purcha&s;e hou&s;es. To di&s;tingui&s;h them from others, they are obliged to wear yellow caps.</P>

<P>The duchy of Lorrain, or Lothier, is a part of the antient kingdom of Lorrain, or Lothier; and took its name from Lotharius II. to whom it was allotted by his father Lotharius, in the partition of his dominions among his &s;ons. The duchy is bounded to the &s;outh by Franche-Comt&eacute;, to the north by the Netherlands, to the ea&s;t by the Lower Palatinate, and to the we&s;t by Champagne; being above an hundred miles in length, and near as much in breadth. Though there are many woods and mountains in the country, yet the &s;oil is gene|rally fruitful, yielding plenty of grain, wine, hemp, and pa&s;ture: nor is it de&s;titute of mines of iron, copper, tin, and &s;ilver; nor of &s;alt &s;prings, pre|cious &s;tones, and game; and its lakes and rivers abound with fi&s;h. Of the rivers, the mo&s;t con&s;ide|rable are, the Maes, the Mo&s;elle, the Meurte, the Saar, the Soane, and the Vezou&s;e. The Romi&s;h is the religion of the country, and its language the French, except in &s;ome di&s;tricts, in which the Ger|man is &s;poken. In the year 1734 the French king, when he declared war again&s;t the emperor Charles

The duchy of Lorrain, properly &s;o called, is divided into three di&s;tricts or bailiwics, in which the principal places are,</P>
<P>Nancy, the capital of the whole duchy, &s;itu|ated on the river Meurte, twenty miles from Metz, to the &s;outh. It is divided into the Old and New Town, of which the latter is the large&s;t and mo&s;t beautiful; but the ducal palace is in the former, which is al&s;o fortified. Here are a great many convents, &s;everal churches, of which &s;ome are collegiate, an academy of &s;ciences, a commandery of the knights of Malta, and a rich ho&s;pital, in which a va&s;t number of poor are maintained. In the church of St. George is the monument of Charles the Bold, duke of Burgun|dy, who was killed while he was be&s;ieging this city in the year 1476.</P>
<P>St. Nicholas, in Latin Fanum Sti Nicolai, a market-town on the river Meurte, &s;ix miles above Nancy to the &s;outh.

<HEAD>The GOVERNMENT of ALSACE.</HEAD>
<P>Al&s;ace is bounded to the north by the Palatinate, to the &s;outh by Switzerland and the El&s;gau, to the ea&s;t by the Ortenau and Bri&s;gau, and to the we&s;t by Lorrain and Burgundy, extending, from north to &s;outh, upwards of &s;ixty miles. Its inhabitants were antiently called El&s;a&s;&s;en, i. e. the Saxons liv|ing about the Ell, now called the Ill, and the coun|try it&s;elf El&s;as, which, at length, was corrupted in|to Al&s;ace. The &s;oil, in general, is good, yielding grain, flax, fruits, wine, wood, tobacco, and pa&s;ture. Some parts yield al&s;o &s;affron and hemp; &s;ome only Turki&s;h corn, rye, oats, or barley; and &s;ome are woody and uncultivated. The Wa&s;gau mountains, in Latin Montes Voge&s;i, which &s;eparate this country from Lorrain, are very lofty, and con|tain the &s;ources of many rivers. A great variety of trees, &s;hrubs, and plants, grow wild upon them; and there are &s;everal large fore&s;ts, abounding in deer, and game of all kinds: they yield al&s;o mines of &s;ilver, copper, lead, &s;teel, and iron; not to men|tion antimony, cobalt, &s;ulphur, coal, mineral wa|ters, and baths hot and cold. The principal rivers that fall from the Wa&s;gau mountains, and water Up|per or Lower Al&s;ace, are the Leber, the Cher, the Andlau, the Ergers, the Breu&s;ch, the Sorr, the Mot|ter, the Seltzbach, the Lauter, the Queich, the Ber, and the Ill. The Rhine, in who&s;e &s;ands are found par|ticles of gold, and which is generally highe&s;t in &s;ummer, from the melting of the &s;now on the Alps, divides it from Germany. There are al&s;o &s;everal lakes in it. The language of the inhabi|tants
<PB N="226" REF="2270">
is the German, and the religion either Lu|therani&s;m or popery: their number is computed at about half a million. At the peace of Mun&s;ter, the emperor yielded up to France the town of Bri|&s;ac, the landgravate of Upper and Lower Al&s;ace, the Sundgau, and the di&s;trict of the ten imperial cities in Al&s;ace, with the &s;overeignty thereof; and, at the peace of Ry&s;wick, in 1697, the emperor and empire ceded to France the perpetual &s;overeignty of Stra&s;burg, and its dependencies, on the left &s;ide of the Rhine. The principal places in Lower Al|&s;ace are,</P>
<P>Stra&s;burg, in Latin Argentoratum, the capital of the whole country, and formerly a free imperial city, &s;ituated on the rivers Ill and Breu&s;ch, about a quarter of a league from the Rhine. It took the Latin name of Argentoratum from the antient city of that name which &s;tood near it; and that of Stra&s;|burg from its &s;tanding near a highway, called by the Latin writers of the middle age &s;trata. It is a large and antient city, but has no fine buildings. The number of the inhabitants is computed at about forty thou&s;and. The ramparts, being plant|ed with trees, form a plea&s;ant walk of near two hours. The bridge over the Rhine is near an Engli&s;h mile long; where a toll is levied upon all pa&s;&s;engers, whether on foot or hor&s;eback, and upon all carriages. Though the city may be laid under water, it is well fortified, and has a regular citadel. The garri&s;on commonly amounts to between eight and nine thou&s;and men: from the pay of the offi|cers a monthly deduction is made for the &s;upport of the theatre. The cathedral is the principal &s;tructure in Stra&s;burg that merits ob&s;ervation, on the corners of which were once the figures of monkeys, a&s;&s;es, hogs, &amp;c. in monki&s;h habits; but the&s;e images have been defaced. The ornaments pre&s;ent|ed to this church by Lewis XIV. are &s;aid to have
<PB N="227" REF="2280">
co&s;t &s;ix hundred thou&s;and dollars: its &s;teeple is ju&s;t|ly reckoned one of the highe&s;t in Europe, there be|ing about &s;ix hundred and fifty-four &s;teps from the pavement to the top: the great bell in it weighs above ten tons; and another, called the &s;ilver bell, as being mo&s;tly of that metal, two tons, &s;ix hun|dred-weight, which is rung only twice a-year: in this church is likewi&s;e a large clock, which ex|hibits the various motions of the planets. The other public buildings of any note are the epi&s;co|pal palace, the ar&s;enal, the playhou&s;e, the royal and the city ho&s;pitals: in the latter may be &s;een &s;ome grain of a great age, and wine of the growth of 1472, 1519, and 1525. Though the ta&s;te of the&s;e wines is not much better than that of &s;our lees, yet a few drops can only be obtained for a guilder. The phy&s;ic garden and the anatomical theatre, in this city, are well worth &s;eeing. There are al&s;o &s;everal convents here; together with a Lu|theran univer&s;ity and gymna&s;ium; a royal &s;ociety, founded in 1752, chiefly for the natural hi&s;tory of Al&s;ace; and a great many churches, mo&s;t of which are now in the hands of the papi&s;ts; yet the great|er part of the burghers are Lutherans, and of the members of the city council, one half are Lutherans, and the re&s;t Roman catholics. By the capitulation in 1681, the citizens were to pay no taxes to the king, and to be maintained in the enjoyment of all their antient privileges: many encroachments, notwith|&s;tanding, have been made upon them. At the head of the magi&s;tracy is a royal praetor, who&s;e office it is to take care of the king's rights, and that nothing be done contrary to his maje&s;ty's plea|&s;ure. The &s;oldiers of the garri&s;on are lodged in ca&s;erns, built at the expence of the burghers. The bi&s;hopric is not worth, at pre&s;ent, above two hundred and fifty thou&s;and livres. The canons of the cathedral mu&s;t all be counts of the empire, or

<P>Zabern or Al&s;ace-Zabern, in Latin Tabernae Al&s;atiae, a little town on the river Sor, belonging to the bi&s;hop of Stra&s;burg, who is temporal lord or &s;uperior of a great part of Al&s;ace, and, by virtue of two di&s;tricts belonging to him, and lying on the other &s;ide the Rhine, is a prince of the empire, with a &s;eat and vote in the diet.</P>

Mo&s;t of the inhabitants are Lutherans, who enjoy the pub|lic exerci&s;e of their religion.</P>
<P><PB N="229" REF="2300">
New-Bri&s;ac, a &s;mall town, built by Lewis XIV. after the peace of Ry&s;wick, about half a league from the Rhine, oppo&s;ite to Old-Bri&s;ac. It is &s;trongly fortified, and &s;o regular, that from the great mar|ket-place the four gates of the town may be &s;een.</P>
<P>The other places worth mentioning in Upper-Al|&s;ace are En&s;i&s;heim, a pretty town, about twelve miles from Bri&s;ac, on the Ill; Kay&s;er&s;berg; and Mun&s;ter, in the Gregorienthal.</P>
<P>The government of Al&s;ace comprehends al&s;o the Sundgau, i. e. the Southern Di&s;trict, &s;o called in oppo&s;ition to the Nordgau, or Northern Di&s;trict. This territory is bounded to the &s;outh by the bi|&s;hopric of Ba&s;il, the earidom of Mumpelgarde, and Franche-Comt&eacute;; to the north by Upper-Al&s;ace; to the ea&s;t by the Rhine, and the canton of Ba&s;il; and to the we&s;t by Lorrain. It is about twelve leagues in length, and near as much in breadth. Mo&s;t of the inhabitants &s;peak German, and are pa|pi&s;ts. This country, though mountainous, pro|duces a great deal of corn and wine, and is watered by the river Ill or Ell. At the peace of Mun&s;ter, in 1648, it was ceded by the emperor and empire to France; and the family of Mazarin now hold it, under the king. The only places in it worth men|tioning are,</P>

<HEAD>The GOVERNMENT of FRANCHE COMTE.</HEAD>
<P>Franche Comt&eacute;, or the county of Burgundy, is bounded to the &s;outh and we&s;t by the government of Champagne and Burgundy; to the north by Lorrain; and to the ea&s;t by the earldom of Mum|pelgard, and Switzerland; being in length from north to &s;outh about thirty leagues, and in breadth about twenty. It is partly flat, and partly hilly. The flat country is fruitful in grain, wine, hemp, and pa&s;ture; and the hilly abounds in cattle, pro|ducing al&s;o &s;ome wine and corn, copper, lead, iron, and &s;ilver ore, mineral waters, quarries of &s;tone, marble, alaba&s;ter, and &s;alt-&s;prings. The chief ri|vers are the Saone, the Ougnon, the Doux, the Louve, and the Dain. Lewis XIV. &s;eized this county in 1668; but was obliged to re&s;tore it next year: he &s;eized it again, however, in 1674, and had it confirmed to him by the treaties of Nime|guen and Ry&s;wick. Be&s;ides a governor-general and his lieutenant, it has &s;everal inferior governors, and a parliament. In regard to &s;pirituals, the greater part of it lies in the dioce&s;e of Be&s;an&ccedil;on, and the re&s;t in tho&s;e of Langres, Lau&s;anne, and Toul. The principal places in it are,</P>
<P>Be&s;an&ccedil;on, in Latin Ve&s;ontio or Be&s;ontium, the capital, &s;eated on the river Doux, which divides it
<PB N="231" REF="2320">
into the Upper and Lower town. Here are a great many convents, both of men and maidens, &s;everal ho&s;pitals, palaces, fountains, and inferior courts of ju&s;tice, with a parliament, an archbi&s;hopric, and an univer&s;ity. The archbi&s;hop takes the title of a prince of the empire, has three &s;uffragans, viz. the bi&s;hop of Lau&s;anne, Ba&s;il, and Belley, and a revenue of thirty-&s;ix thou&s;and livres, out of which his taxa|tion at the court of Rome is one thou&s;and and twenty-three florins. The univer&s;ity, which was removed from Dole to this city, in the year 1691, has profe&s;&s;ors of divinity, law, phy&s;ic, and the languages. The city is well fortified, and al&s;o defended by two citadels.</P>
<P>Dole, a town on the river Doux, about eight leagues &s;outh-we&s;t from Be&s;an&ccedil;on. There are &s;e|veral fine &s;treets here; but it was more con&s;iderable before the taking of Be&s;an&ccedil;on, when it was the ca|pital of the country, and the &s;eat of the parliament and univer&s;ity. Here is &s;till a chamber of ac|counts, a chapter, and a great many convents.</P>
<P>Salins, in Latin Salinae, a pretty large town, which takes its name from its &s;alt &s;prings, and &s;tands &s;ix leagues &s;outh from Be&s;an&ccedil;on, and as ma|ny ea&s;t from Dole. The &s;alt-&s;prings here are in va&s;t caves under-ground; whence the water is rai&s;ed by cranes, pumps, and other engines, conveyed in|to re&s;ervoirs, and from thence into iron kettle&sacute;, where it is boiled into &s;alt. The waters are &s;up|po&s;ed to acquire their &s;altne&s;s by running through mines of &s;alt, and not to come from the &s;ea. A great deal of this &s;alt is &s;ent into Switzerland in ca&s;ks; and the re&s;t, by means of wooden moulds, is made into cakes and loaves of three or four pounds weight, and laid up in the warehou&s;es, un|til they are &s;old. Va&s;t quantities of wood and coals are required for making the &s;alt, and the

kettles. In the neighbourhood are &s;everal forts, and quarries of ja&s;per, beautiful alaba&s;ter, and black marble; and in the town it&s;elf, &s;undry churches and chapters, and a great many convents. The only other places in the province worth men|tioning are Gray and Ve&s;oul. The former &s;tands on the Soane, about nine leagues from Be&s;an&ccedil;on, and has more trade than any other place in the province, a great deal of iron and wheat being &s;ent from hence to Lyons.

<P>With re&s;pect to the air, in the &s;outhern provinces it would be exce&s;&s;ive hot, if it were not refre&s;hed by the &s;ea-breezes; but, in the northern, the air
<PB N="234" REF="2350">
is much cooler, and the weather more &s;ubject to rains. The &s;pring is extremely delightful here, and the air, in general, more temperate than in Spain. Li&s;bon hath been much re&s;orted to of late by va|letudinarians, and con&s;umptive per&s;ons, from Great Britain, on account of its air. The &s;oil is very fruitful in wine, oil, lemons, oranges, pomegra|nates, figs, rai&s;ins, almonds, che&s;nuts, and other fine fruits; but there is a want of corn, owing, it is &s;aid, in a great mea&s;ure to the neglect of agriculture. There is plenty of excellent honey here, and al&s;o of &s;ea and river-fi&s;h, and &s;ea-&s;alt. The hor&s;es in Por|tugal are bri&s;k lively animals, as they are in Spain, but of a &s;light make: but mules, being &s;urer-footed, are more u&s;ed for carriage and draught. By rea&s;on of the &s;carcity of pa&s;ture, there are not many herds of cattle or flocks of &s;heep, and what they have are &s;mall and lean, though the fle&s;h is tolerably good: their be&s;t meat is &s;aid to be that of hogs and kids. The country in many parts is moun|tainous; but the mountains contain all kinds of ores, particularly of &s;ilver, copper, tin, and iron, with a variety of gems, beautifully variegated mar|ble, mill-&s;tones, and many curious fo&s;&s;ils of the lapidious kind. Not far from Li&s;bon is a mine of &s;alt-petre; but none of the metal mines here are worked, the inhabitants being &s;upplied with their contents from their foreign &s;ettlements. The principal rivers are the Minho, in Latin Minius; the Limia, antiently the famed Lethe; the Cavado; the Douro; the Guadiana, antiently Anas; and the Tajo, or Tagus, which is the large&s;t river in the kingdom, carrying &s;ome gold in its &s;ands, and falling into the &s;ea a little below Li&s;bon.

<HEAD>RELIGION, LEARNING, and LANGUAGE.</HEAD>
<P>The only religion tolerated in Portugal is that of the church of Rome, yet there are many con|cealed Jews, and tho&s;e too even among the nobi|lity, bi&s;hops, prebends, monks, and nuns; and the very inqui&s;itors them&s;elves. If a Jew pre|tends to be a Chri&s;tian and a Roman catholic, while he is really a Jew, by going to ma&s;s, confe&s;&s;ion, &amp;c. or if after being converted, or pretending to be converted and pardoned, he relap&s;es into Judai&s;m, and is di&s;covered, the inqui&s;ition lays hold of him. In the fir&s;t ca&s;e, if they renounce Judai&s;m, they are only condemned to &s;ome corpo|ral puni&s;hment or public &s;hame, and then ordered to be in&s;tructed in the Chri&s;tian religion. In the &s;econd they are condemned to the flames without mercy. Be&s;ides Jews and heretics, who broach or maintain any doctrines contrary to the religion of the country, the inqui&s;ition puni&s;hes all &s;odo|mites, pretenders to &s;orcery and the black art, apo&s;tates, bla&s;phemers, perjured per&s;ons, impo&s;tors, and hypocrites. The burning of tho&s;e condemned by the inqui&s;ition, is called an <HI>auto da fe,</HI> or act of faith. There are &s;everal tribunals of the inqui&s;i|tion, one of which is at Goa, in the Ea&s;t-Indies; but there are none in Bra&s;il. The number of con|vents in Portugal is &s;aid to be nine hundred. The order of the Je&s;uits hath been &s;uppre&s;&s;ed in this country, as well as in the kingdoms of France, Spain, and Naples, and the duchy of Parma. Here is a patriarch, &s;everal archbi&s;hops and bi&s;hops: the patriarch is always a cardinal, and of the royal family. The archbi&s;hops rank with marqui&s;&s;es, and the bi&s;hops with counts. The Portugue&s;e have archbi&s;hops and bi&s;hops in the other quarters of the world, as well as in Europe. The &s;ums rai&s;ed
<PB N="236" REF="2370">
by the popes here, by virtue of their prerogatives, are thought to exceed the revenues of the crown, and the nuncios never fail of acquiring va&s;t for|tunes in a &s;hort time. Though there are two uni|ver&s;ities, and &s;everal academies, yet while the pa|pal power, and that of the eccle&s;ia&s;tics continues at &s;uch a height, true learning is like to make but a &s;mall progre&s;s. The language of the Portugue&s;e does not differ much from that of Spain: Latin is the ground-work of both, but the former is more remote from it, and har&s;her to the ear than the latter. The Portugue&s;e tongue is &s;poken on all the coa&s;ts of Africa and A&s;ia as far as China, but mixed with the languages of the &s;everal nations in tho&s;e di&s;tant regions.</P>

<HEAD>MANUFACTURES and TRADE.</HEAD>
<P>With regard to manufactures, there are very few in Portugal, and tho&s;e chiefly coar&s;e &s;ilks, woollen cloths, and &s;ome linen; but their foreign trade is very con&s;iderable, e&s;pecially with England, which takes a great deal of their wine, &s;alt, foreign commodities, and fruits, in return for its woollen manufactures, with which the Portugue&s;e furni&s;h their colonies and &s;ubjects in A&s;ia, Africa, and A|merica. Their plantations in Brazil are very valu|able, yielding gold, diamonds, indigo, copper, tobacco, &s;ugar, ginger, cotton, hides, gums, drugs, dying woods, &amp;c. From their plantations in A|frica, they bring gold and ivory, and &s;laves to manure their &s;ugar and tobacco plantations in Brazil. They have &s;till &s;everal &s;ettlements in the Ea&s;t-Indies, but far le&s;s con&s;iderable than formerly, together with the Azores or We&s;tern I&s;les, Ma|deira, and the Cape de Verde i&s;lands; but a great part of the riches and merchandize brought from the&s;e di&s;tant countries becomes the property
<PB N="237" REF="2380">
of foreigners, for the goods they furni&s;h the Portu|gue&s;e with to carry thither. The king's fifth of the gold brought from Brazil amounts, commu|nibus annis, to about three hundred thou&s;and pounds &s;terling; &s;o that the whole annual produce of gold in Brazil may be e&s;timated at near two millions &s;terling. Li&s;bon is the greate&s;t port in Europe next to London and Am&s;terdam. It was the Dutch who deprived the Portugue&s;e of mo&s;t of their &s;ettlements in A&s;ia and Africa. Whether from &s;ome mi&s;taken notion in politics, or &s;ome national prejudice, or whatever other cau&s;e, is uncertain, but the pre&s;ent prime mini&s;ter has taken every occa&s;ion, during his admini&s;tration, of di&s;couraging, re&s;training, and di&s;tre&s;&s;ing the Briti&s;h factories and commerce in this kingdom. This conduct &s;eems the more unaccountable, as the very exi&s;tence of the nation, as an independent &s;tate, has &s;o long, and &s;o often, depended upon the power|ful protection of Great Britain; which has al&s;o, upon every occa&s;ion, always acted the part of a faithful ally and generous friend. If the advan|tages ari&s;ing from the commerce between the two nations were not mutual, this conduct might ad|mit of &s;ome plea in its ju&s;tification; but the con|trary is evidently &s;hewn, by the great preference which has been &s;o long given by England to the Portugue&s;e wines, for which they could find no other market, and the con&s;equent immen&s;e con|&s;umption of them in the&s;e kingdoms. Many, and not without rea&s;on, have been &s;urprized at the &s;u|pinene&s;s of the Briti&s;h mini&s;try, in putting up &s;o long with the frequent oppo&s;itions, in&s;ults, and in|dignities, which have been &s;o repeatedly offered to the Briti&s;h merchants in this country, and no le&s;s at the temerity of the Portugue&s;e mini&s;ter, in venturing to rou&s;e the indignation of a nation, which

The &s;ilver coins are a vintain, equal to twenty rees; a real, equal to forty; an half|te&s;ton, equal to fifty; and a whole, equal to an hundred. The gold coins are the moedas, or moi|dores, as they are called in England; and the Johns, or three-pound-twelves, and their &s;ubdivi&s;ions. An hundred rees are only equal to eight-pence Engli&s;h.

Both here and in Spain, there were antiently cortes, &s;tates, or par|liaments; but they have long &s;ince entirely lo&s;t their &s;hare in the legi&s;lature. For the admini&s;tra|tion of the civil government, there is a council of &s;tate, and &s;everal &s;ecretaries; for military affairs, a council of war; for the finances, a trea&s;ury-court; and, for the di&s;tribution of ju&s;tice, &s;everal high tri|bunals, with others &s;ubordinate to them, in the &s;everal di&s;tricts into which the kingdom is divided. The cities have their particular magi&s;tracy. The proceedings of the courts are regulated by the Ro|man law, the royal edicts, the canon law, and the pope's mandates. Like the Spaniards, they tran&s;|act
<PB N="239" REF="2400">
mo&s;t of their bu&s;ine&s;s in the mornings and evenings, and &s;leep at noon. The nobility are very numerous, and many of them are de&s;cended from natural &s;ons of the royal family. They are di|vided into the high and low. The high con&s;i&s;ts of the dukes, marqui&s;&s;es, counts, vi&s;counts, and ba|rons, who are al&s;o grandees, but of different cla&s;&s;es, being &s;uffered to be covered in the king's pre&s;ence, and having the title of dons, with a pen&s;ion from the royal trea&s;ury, to enable them the better to &s;upport their dignity: the king &s;tiles them illu&s;|trious in his letters, and treats them as princes. A duke's &s;ons are al&s;o grandees, and his daughters rank as marchione&s;&s;es. The inferior nobility or gentry are termed Hidalgos, i. e. gentlemen: they cannot a&s;&s;ume the title of don, without the king's licence.</P>

<HEAD>REVENUES and FORCES.</HEAD>
<P>The revenues of the crown, &s;ince the di&s;covery of the Brazil mines are very con&s;iderable; but the real amount can only be gue&s;&s;ed at. Some have &s;aid that it amounts, clear of all &s;alaries and pen|&s;ions, to upwards of three millions &s;terling: others make it a great deal le&s;s. Thus much is certain, that the cu&s;toms and other taxes run exce&s;&s;ively high. Be&s;ides the royal deme&s;nes, the hereditary e&s;tates of the hou&s;e of Braganza, the monopoly of Brazil &s;nuff, the coinage, the money ari&s;ing from the &s;ale of indulgences granted by the pope, the fifth of the gold brought from Brazil, the farm of the Brazil diamonds, the ma&s;ter&s;hips of the orders of knighthood, and other &s;ources, yield very large &s;ums. The forces', notwith&s;tanding, of this na|tion, both by &s;ea and land, are very incon&s;iderable; their land-forces being the wor&s;t militia in Eu|rope, and their navy of little importance. They

would be an ea&s;y conque&s;t to the Spaniards, if they were not under the protection of England.</P>

<P>There are &s;everal orders of knighthood here, viz. 1. The order of Chri&s;t, the badge of which is a red cro&s;s within a white one, and the number of the commanderies four hundred and fifty-four. 2. The order of St. James, the badge of which is a red &s;word, in the &s;hape of a cro&s;s. A great number of towns and commanderies belong to this order. 3. The order of Aviz, who&s;e badge is a green cro&s;s, in form of a lilly, and the number of its commanderies forty-nine. Though the&s;e three orders are religious, yet the knights are at liberty to marry. 4. The order of St. John, which has al&s;o &s;everal commanderies.</P>

<HEAD>REVOLUTIONS.</HEAD>
<P>In the year 1110, Alphon&s;o VI. king of Ca&s;tile, be&s;towed Portugal upon his &s;on-in law, Henry of Burgundy, for his great &s;ervices again&s;t the Moors: his &s;on, Alphon&s;o-Henry, a&s;&s;umed the title of king; and his de&s;cendants &s;at on the throne of Portugal until 1580, when they failed: the next year the kingdom was united to Spain; but, in 1640, it &s;hook off the Spani&s;h yoke, and advanced John duke of Braganza to the throne, who&s;e po&s;terity are &s;till in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it. The pre&s;ent king hav|ing no male i&s;&s;ue, a di&s;pen&s;ation was obtained, &s;ome years ago, from the pope, by virtue of which the king's brother married the prince&s;s of Brazil, by whom he has i&s;&s;ue.</P>

<HEAD>PERSONS, CHARACTER, and DRESS.</HEAD>
<P>The Portugue&s;e are repre&s;ented as inferior to the Spaniards, both in per&s;on and genius; as extremely haughty, treacherous, and crafty in their dealings; much given to avarice and u&s;ury; and vindictive, malicious, and cruel. The meaner &s;ort are &s;aid to be extremely addicted to thieving: notwith&s;tand|ing, it mu&s;t be owned, that they have &s;hewn them|&s;elves, on many occa&s;ions, a brave and warlike peo|ple. They are ju&s;tly famed for their &s;kill in naviga|tion; and for the many di&s;coveries they have made, both in the Ea&s;t and We&s;t Indies. No|thing al&s;o is more certain, than that all countries have men good and bad, great and mean, with and without genius. The women here, and in other countries of the &s;ame degree of heat, are not &s;o pro|lific as in the colder climates; but they are &s;aid to be very beautiful, whil&s;t young, though their com|plexion is &s;omewhat upon the olive. Their eyes are very black and &s;parkling, and retain their bril|liancy after all their other charms are gone. It is the fa&s;hion here, at pre&s;ent, as in mo&s;t other countries, for the ladies to &s;poil and disfigure their &s;kins and complexions, with paints and wa&s;hes: but, tho' live|ly and witty, they are &s;aid to have a nice &s;en&s;e of fe|male
<PB N="242" REF="2430">
honour. Both men and women make great u&s;e of &s;pectacles; often not &s;o much to aid their &s;ight, as to denote their wi&s;dom and gravity. Their dre&s;s, like that of the Spaniards, never u&s;ed to vary till of late, e&s;pecially among the men; but, of late years, both men and women have given much into the French modes. The women, when they go abroad on foot, are wont to u&s;e long veils, which cover their heads, but leave their faces bare.</P>

<HEAD>ENTRE DOURO E MINHO.</HEAD>
<P>This province is &s;o called from its &s;ituation be|twixt the&s;e two famed rivers, and from thence al&s;o, in Latin, has the name of Interamnen&s;is. The Minho &s;eparates it from Galicia on the north; the Douro from Beira on the &s;outh; on the we&s;t it is bounded by the Ocean; and on the ea&s;t by a ridge of mountains, which part it from the province of Tras os Montes, or Over the Hills: its extent from north to &s;outh being about &s;eventy miles, and from ea&s;t to we&s;t fifty. It is the mo&s;t populous pro|vince of the kingdom, and one of the mo&s;t fruit|ful, though mountainous, yielding plenty of pa&s;ture, wine, and fruit, but not a &s;ufficiency of corn for its inhabitants. The principal places in it are,</P>
<P>Braga, a very antient city, between the rivers Ca|vaco and De&s;te, about an hundred and eighty miles north of Li&s;bon. It was antiently the capital of the Bracarii, who came hither from Celtic-Gaul, called al&s;o Gallia Bracata, from whom Galicia, and, as &s;ome think, Portugal al&s;o, had their names, as well as this city. The Romans planted a colo|ny here, and named the town Augu&s;ta-Bracaria. It is the &s;ee of an archbi&s;hop, who is primate of Por|tugal,
<PB N="243" REF="2440">
and &s;piritual and temporal lord of the city and neighbouring country. Here is a &s;tately an|tient cathedral and archiepi&s;copal palace, a great many convents, &s;everal pari&s;h churches, about twelve thou&s;and inhabitants, a noble ho&s;pital, a large college, and a hou&s;e of mercy, which is a cha|ritable foundation for the relief of per&s;ons of good families fallen to decay, and for marrying of young maidens, and putting boys to employments. The archbi&s;hop's revenue is &s;aid to be forty thou&s;and cru&s;adoes, or &s;ix thou&s;and pounds &s;terling. There are &s;ome remains of antiquity in it, particularly of an amphitheatre and aqueduct.</P>
<P>Porto or Oporto, on the river Douro, which, a little below, falls into the &s;ea. Here is a com|modious harbour, much frequented by the Engli&s;h; but the bar at the entrance into it is &s;omewhat dan|gerous. Next to Li&s;bon, it is the city of greate&s;t opulence, beauty, and trade, in the kingdom. At the mouth of the river is a ca&s;tle to guard it, called St. John's. Oppo&s;ite the town, on the other &s;ide the river, is Gaya, a &s;mall place, which was antient|ly called Cale; and Oporto, when fir&s;t built, was called Portucale, or the harbour of Cale: hence al&s;o, as &s;ome think, the kingdom derived its name. Here are above twenty thou&s;and inhabitants, &s;eve|ral ho&s;pitals and pari&s;h-churches, be&s;ides the ca|thedral, a great many convents, a mint, &s;everal courts of ju&s;tice, and the &s;ee of a bi&s;hop, who &s;tiles him&s;elf Epi&s;copus Portucalen&s;is, and has a revenue of fifteen thou&s;and cru&s;adoes, or two thou&s;and pounds. The city is fortified only with an old wall and towers. It had formerly its particular lords; but now belongs to the crown, and &s;tands an hundred and twenty miles north of Li&s;bon.</P>
<P>Guimaranes, a &s;mall but antient town, belonging to the crown, ten miles ea&s;t of Braga, and about an hundred and fifty north of Li&s;bon. It is en|compa&s;&s;ed with a good wall, contains about five

The people are more indu&s;trious, have more trade, and a greater variety of manufactures, and con&s;equently live better, than in the other provinces, which this &s;urpa&s;&s;es al&s;o in re&s;pect of its &s;oil, commodious &s;ea|ports, and the inland navigation of the Tagus: add to the&s;e, the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the metropolis and the court, which alone are &s;ufficient to turn the &s;cale in its favour, and to render it more flouri&s;hing than the more di&s;tant provinces. It contains three cities, an hundred and eleven &s;mall towns, three hundred and fifteen pari&s;hes, and about two hun|dred thou&s;and &s;ouls. The principal places are,</P>
<P>Li&s;bon, the capital both of the province and kingdom, &s;tanding near the mouth of the river Ta|gus, on the north &s;ide. It was antiently called Oli|&s;ipo, Oli&s;ippo, and Uly&s;&s;ipo, which are &s;uppo&s;ed to be derived from the Phenician Ulis-ubbo or Oli&s;ippo, &s;ignifying, in that tongue, a plea&s;ant bay, &s;uch as that on which this city &s;tands. It fir&s;t became con&s;iderable in the reign of king Emanuel: from that time, it hath been the capital of the kingdom, the re&s;idence of its monarchs, the &s;eat of the chief tribunals and offices, of the metropolitan, a noble univer&s;ity, and the receptacle of the riche&s;t merchandize of the Ea&s;t and We&s;t Indies. Its air is excellent; being refre&s;hed by the delightful &s;ea breezes, and tho&s;e of the Tagus. The city ex|tends for about two miles along the Tagus; but its breadth is incon&s;iderable. Like Old Rome, it &s;tands on &s;even hills; but the &s;treets, in general, are narrow and dirty, and &s;ome of them are very &s;teep; neither are they lighted at night. The churches, in general, are very fine; but the magni|ficence

Here is one of the fine&s;t harbours in the world, and there were a great number not only of fine churches and convents here, but al&s;o of other public buildings, and particularly of royal palaces, and others be|longing to the grandees; but the greate&s;t part of them, and the city, were de&s;troyed by a mo&s;t dreadful earthquake, on November 1, 1755, from which it will require a long time to recover. The inhabitants, before the earthquake, did not, at mo&s;t, exceed an hundred and fifty thou&s;and. The government of it is lodged in a council, con&s;i&s;ting of a pre&s;ident, &s;ix coun&s;ellors, and other inferior officers. The harbour has water enough for the large&s;t &s;hips, and room enough for ten thou&s;and &s;ail, without being crowded. For its &s;ecurity, there is a fort at the mouth of the river, on each &s;ide; and a bar that runs acro&s;s it, and is very dan|gerous to pa&s;s without pilots. Higher up, at a place where the river is con&s;iderably contracted, there is a fort called Torre de Belem, or the Tower of Be|lem, under who&s;e guns all &s;hips mu&s;t pa&s;s in their way to the city, and on the other &s;ide are &s;everal more forts. Before the earthquake, mo&s;t of the private hou&s;es were old and un&s;ightly, with lattice windows; and the number of convents and colleges amounted to fifty, namely, thirty-two for monks, and eighteen for nuns. The king's principal palace &s;tands on the river, and is large and commodious. Of the ho&s;pitals, that called the Great is obliged to receive all per&s;ons, of what degree, nation, or reli|gion &s;oever, without exception. At the village of Belem, near Li&s;bon, is a noble ho&s;pital for decayed gentlemen who have &s;erved the king, and have not wherewithal to maintain them&s;elves. That called the Hou&s;e of Mercy is al&s;o a noble charity. In the center of the city, upon one of the highe&s;t hills, is the ca&s;tle, which commands the whole, being

large and antient, and having always a garri&s;on of four regiments of foot. The cathedral is a va&s;t edifice of the Gothic kind, but heavy and clum&s;y: it contains, however, great riches, and is finely adorned within. The &s;quare called Ro&s;io is large, and &s;urrounded with magnificent buildings. The whole city is under the eccle&s;ia&s;tical juri&s;diction of the patriarch, who was appointed in the year 1717. Here is al&s;o an archbi&s;hop, who has, or at lea&s;t had before the erection of the patriarchate, a revenue of forty thou&s;and cru&s;adoes, or &s;ix thou&s;and pounds. The univer&s;ity, which was removed for &s;ome time to Coimbra, but afterwards re&s;tored to its antient &s;eat, makes a con&s;iderable figure, though much in|ferior to that of Coimbra. At Belem, a hand&s;ome village in the neighbourhood, is a royal palace, and a magnificent mona&s;tery of the order of St. Je|rom. The country between Li&s;bon and Abran|tes is a delicious plain, thick-&s;et with olive, and other fruit trees.</P>

<HEAD>The KINGDOM of ALGARVE.</HEAD>
<P>This little kingdom is bounded to the &s;outh and we&s;t by the ocean; to the ea&s;t by the Guadiana, which parts it from Andalu&s;ia; and to the north by the mountains, called Serra de Algarve, or Caldeirao, and Serra de Monachique, which divide it from Alentejo; its greate&s;t length being about one hundred miles, but its breadth only about twenty-eight. Its name is of Moori&s;h extraction, but geographers are not agreed about its meaning. Under it was comprehended formerly a much larger extent of country than at pre&s;ent. The pre&s;ent Algarve was given by Alfon&s;o X. king of Ca&s;tile, to Alfon&s;o III. king of Portugal, as a dowry or portion, when he married Beatrix, his natural daughter. Though very mountainous, it is very fertile in corn, wine, and oil, and all &s;orts of fruits, and contains four cities, twelve le&s;&s;er towns, &s;ixty villages, &s;ixty-&s;even pari&s;hes, and about &s;ixty thou&s;and inhabitants. The principal places are,</P>
<P>Lagos, a town with a harbour on a large bay, about one hundred and ten miles &s;outh from Li&s;|bon, and twenty-five ea&s;t from Cape St. Vincent.

<P>Terceira was &s;o called becau&s;e it was the third that was di&s;covered.

<DIV3>
<HEAD>NAME, EXTENT, and BOUNDARIES.</HEAD>
<P>SPAIN was antiently called Iberia and Hi&s;|peria; and it is &s;uppo&s;ed to have had the fir&s;t of the&s;e names from the river Iberus, and the other from its we&s;tern &s;ituation. He&s;pania, from which all its modern names are derived, is &s;up|po&s;ed to have been formed from the Phenician word &s;epan or &s;epana, &s;ignifying a rabbit, with which animal this country hath always abounded. It is the mo&s;t we&s;tern part of the continent of Eu|rope, lying between the 36th and 44th degrees of north latitude, and between the 3d of ea&s;t and 10th of we&s;t longitude; and is bounded on the ea&s;t and &s;outh by the Mediterranean, the Streights of Gibraltar, and part of the Atlantic Ocean; on the we&s;t by the &s;ame ocean, and Portugal; and on the north by the Bay of Bi&s;cay, and the ridge of
<PB N="262" REF="2640">
mountains called the Pyrenees, which part it from France. Its greate&s;t length, from ea&s;t to we&s;t, is about &s;even hundred miles; and its greate&s;t breadth, from north to &s;outh, about four hundred and eighty. By the Romans, Spain, including Portugal, was di|vided into Hi&s;pania Cuterior or Tarraconen&s;is, and Hi&s;pania Ulterior; of which the latter was &s;ubdivided into Betica and Lu&s;itania: in each of the&s;e were planted a great many Roman colonies. After the Romans, it was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the Goths, and other barbarous nations, and then by the Moors; from whom it was gradually recovered by the Chri&s;tians, who erected &s;everal petty kingdoms in it, as the infidels had done before them: thence proceeded the pre&s;ent divi&s;ion of Spain into four|teen kingdoms and provinces.</P>

<HEAD>AIR, SOIL, and PRODUCE.</HEAD>
<P>With re&s;pect to the air, during the months of June, July, and Augu&s;t, it is exce&s;&s;ive hot in the day-time; but the re&s;t of the year it is plea&s;ant and temperate. Even during the above months, it is very cool in the &s;hade; and &s;o cold in the night, that it makes a traveller &s;hiver; and in the day-time the violent heat continues only for about four or five hours. In the north, on the mountains and near the &s;ea-coa&s;t, the air is much le&s;s &s;ultry in &s;ummer than in the &s;outh, e&s;pecially in the lower parts of the country, and at a di&s;tance from the &s;ea. It &s;eldom rains here, except a|bout the equinoxes, and the fro&s;ts are very gen|tle towards the &s;outh; but on the mountains in the north, and north-ea&s;t, the air is very &s;harp in winter. Both in the &s;outh and north, the air is generally clear and &s;erene; and, as in the northern countries di&s;tempers, for the mo&s;t part, proceed from colds; &s;o, in Spain, they are commonly the
<PB N="263" REF="2650">
effects of heat. As to what regards the &s;oil, tho' there are &s;ome &s;andy barren de&s;arts in the &s;outh, and many barren mountains in the north, yet in the greater part of the country, particularly in the vallies and plains, the &s;oil is good, producing a great variety of rich wines, oil, and fruits, &s;uch as oranges, lemons, prunes, citrons, almonds, rai&s;ins, dates, figs, che&s;nuts, pomegranates, capers, pears, and peaches; but not a &s;ufficiency of grain, which is chiefly owing to the neglect of tillage. Wheat and barley are the mo&s;t common grain; the for|mer of which is &s;aid by &s;ome to be the be&s;t in Eu|rope. There is not much flax, hemp, oats, or hay in Spain; but plenty of honey, &s;alt, fine wool, &s;ilk, and cotton; and, in &s;ome places, of rice and &s;ugar-canes. Here al&s;o are abundance of mules, and, in &s;ome provinces, of hor&s;es, together with deer, wild-fowl, and other game, Chamois and other goats, but few horned cattle. Wolves are almo&s;t the only wild bea&s;ts in the country. The herb kali, which is u&s;ed in making &s;alt, &s;oap, and gla&s;s, grows in great plenty on the &s;ea-&s;hore. The wild bulls, u&s;ed in their bull-fights, are bred in An|delu&s;ia. The &s;eas about Spain are well &s;tored with fi&s;h, among which is the anchovy, in the Mediter|ranean. We may gue&s;s at the number of &s;heep here by that of the &s;hepherds, which is &s;aid to be about forty thou&s;and. There is a curious account of the &s;heep-walks in Spain in the Annual Regi|&s;ter for the year 1766. The &s;heep that bear the fine wool move regularly every &s;ummer, from &s;outh to north, along the mountains, which yield a great variety of &s;weet-herbs and plants, and re|turn again towards winter. During this progre&s;s, large quantities of &s;alt are di&s;tributed among them, and all po&s;&s;ible care is taken both of their health and fleeces.</P>

<HEAD>MOUNTAINS and RIVERS.</HEAD>
<P>The chief mountains are the Pyrenees, which &s;tretch from the Mediterranean to the Atlantic Ocean, but not in a direct line, for near two hun|dred miles: their breadth is, in &s;ome places, not le&s;s than eighty. That called the Pic de Midi is of a prodigious height. Over the&s;e mountains there are only about five pa&s;&s;ages out of Spain into France, and the&s;e al&s;o narrow: even the vallies between the mountains are covered with thick and lofty woods. The other chains in Spain are the Sierra d'Occa, Sierra Molino, Sierra Morena, and Sierra Novada, or the Snowy Moun|tains. Near Gibraltar, oppo&s;ite to Mount Abyla in Africa, &s;tands the celebrated Mount Calpe: the&s;e were antiently called Hercules's Pillars. The mountains yield great quantities of timber for &s;hip|ping, which are conveyed by the Ebro, and other rivers, to the Mediterranean. According to the antient and modern writers, they abound al&s;o with gold, &s;ilver, iron, lead, tin, cinnabar, quick&s;ilver, alum, vitriol, copperas, lapis calaminaris, &amp;c. be|&s;ides gems, and mineral waters both hot and cold. The gold and &s;ilver mines are not worked at pre|&s;ent, but tho&s;e of iron are. The neglect of the for|mer is owing partly to the indolence of the Spa|niards, and partly to the gold and &s;ilver imported from America. Be&s;ides the rivers Minho, Douro, Tagus, Monda, Lima, and Guadiana, mentioned in Portugal, but which have their &s;ources in Spain, the mo&s;t con&s;iderable are the Ebro, Olim Iberus, Guadalavier or Turio, Guadalquiver, Olim Pe|rea Boetis and Tarte&s;&s;us, Segura, and Zucar. The Guadiana is &s;uppo&s;ed to have had the name of Anas, or the Duck, formerly, from the fal&s;e notion of its lo&s;ing it&s;elf under-ground.</P>

<HEAD>RELIGION and LEARNING.</HEAD>
<P>As to religion, the Spaniards are jealous Ro|mani&s;ts. No where is there more pomp, farce, and parade, in what regards religion; and no where le&s;s true Chri&s;tianity. Their zeal, and their &s;uper&s;tition, exceed that of any other Roman catholic country; unle&s;s, perhaps, we &s;hould except Portugal. No where does the inqui&s;ition reign with greater terror; there being no &s;ubject who is not liable to be pro|&s;ecuted by the holy office, as it is called. In that court it is hardly po&s;&s;ible for a pri&s;oner to make a tolerable defence, not being &s;uffered to know ei|ther his accu&s;ers or the witne&s;&s;es again&s;t him; but he is required to confe&s;s him&s;elf guilty, or &s;ubmit to the torture, until &s;uch a confe&s;&s;ion is extorted from him as the fathers require. God and Chri&s;t are much le&s;s re&s;pected here than the virgin Mary, and other &s;aints; but this is not to be wondered at: in every country religion will become a ridicu|lous mummery, where rea&s;oning and the &s;criptures are di&s;allowed, and the laity are &s;laves to the cler|gy, the latter always thriving in proportion to the ignorance and blindne&s;s of the former. Not to work on Saturday, or to eat pork, is enough to make a man be taken up as a Jew or Mahometan, and, in con&s;equence of that, &s;tripped of his all, and per|haps burnt into the bargain. The inqui&s;itor-general is a per&s;on of great power, dignity, and importance: he is named by the king, and confirmed by the pope, and is at the head of the &s;upreme court of the inqui&s;ition at Madrid, &s;ubordinate to which are &s;e|veral other courts of inqui&s;ition, with, it is &s;aid, above twenty thou&s;and inferior officers, di&s;per&s;ed as &s;pies and informers, all over Spain and the Indies. There is no doubt but there were many converts to Chri&s;tianity here in St. Paul's time, who, in his
<PB N="266" REF="2680">
epi&s;tle to the Romans, mentions his intention to vi&s;it Spain; and &s;ome of the fathers affirm, that he was actually there. There are eight archbi&s;hops in Spain, &s;even in America, and one in A&s;ia, at Ma|nilla; each of which has his &s;uffragan bi&s;hops. The archbi&s;hop of Toledo is primate, chancellor of Ca&s;tile, and, by virtue of his office, privy coun|&s;ellor. He is &s;aid to have a revenue of an hundred thou&s;and pounds &s;terling per annum, or more. The king nominates all archbi&s;hops and bi&s;hops; and, &s;ince 1753, all &s;mall benefices are al&s;o in his gift. He has al&s;o lately obtained a power to tax eccle|&s;ia&s;tical po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, according to his plea&s;ure, and the exigency of affairs. Though the re&s;t of the nation is poor, the clergy are immen&s;ely rich, and their revenues, of all kinds, amazingly great. Mo&s;t of the towns and e&s;tates belong to them, and are exempt from all public burdens; yet their avarice is in&s;atiable, e&s;pecially that of the Mendicant friars, though they profe&s;s poverty. Their commerce, which is free from all duties and impo&s;ts, is al&s;o a rich fund to them: but it is to be ob&s;erved, that the order of Je&s;uits, which was the chief dealer in this way, has been lately &s;uppre&s;&s;ed in this country, and all their e&s;tates &s;eized; which was executed with the greate&s;t addre&s;s, &s;ecrecy, and &s;ucce&s;s, both in Europe and the other domi|nions belonging to the crown. It was thought that the influence they had acquired over this de|luded people was &s;o great, that no king would have ventured to attempt any thing again&s;t them. Tho' the Spaniards are naturally men of wit, and an ele|vated genius, yet little progre&s;s in the &s;ciences is to be expected from them, while the clergy u&s;e their ut|mo&s;t efforts to keep them in ignorance, branding all literary re&s;earches with the name of here&s;y, and in|veighing again&s;t the &s;eats of the mu&s;es, as the &s;chools of hell, where the devil teaches &s;orcery. There are
<PB N="267" REF="2690">
twenty-two univer&s;ities, and &s;everal academies, in Spain; but &s;o con&s;tituted, and under &s;uch re&s;tric|tions, that they can never attain to any mea&s;ure of true learning. The inqui&s;ition is extremely vigilant in &s;uppre&s;&s;ing whatever might tend to open the eyes of the public. There are few printing-hou&s;es in Spain, and mo&s;t of the books in that language are publi&s;hed in other countries.</P>

<DIV3>
<HEAD>TRADE and MANUFACTURES.</HEAD>
<P>In regard to trade and manufactures, the Spa|niards are far from making &s;uch a figure as might be expected. Mo&s;t of the laborious work in their husbandry, manufactures, and handicrafts, is per|formed by the French, e&s;pecially in the two Ca&s;tiles, and the midland provinces, the natives being either too lazy, or too proud, to &s;toop to &s;uch employments. By the&s;e means, the French u&s;ually return with large fortunes to their own country. The chief manufactures of Spain are tho&s;e of &s;ilk, wool, iron, copper, and other hardwares; but the&s;e fall far &s;hort of the flouri&s;hing condition they might be brought to: hence, a great part of the trea&s;ures of America go to the foreign merchants, who &s;upply them with goods for that part of the world. How|ever it is certain, that Spain, &s;ince it hath had princes of the hou&s;e of Bourbon upon the throne, hath improved its revenues, increa&s;ed its forces by &s;ea and land, and applied it&s;elf more than it did before to manufactures and husbandry; having &s;haken off, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, that idle indolent di&s;|po&s;ition which rendered it &s;o contemptible in the eyes of other nations: but it will be a long time before they will be able to &s;upply the wants of their own country, and tho&s;e of America, in any great degree. Spain is extremely well &s;ituated for trade; but mo&s;t of its produce is exported by fo|reigners,
<PB N="268" REF="2700">
except what is carried to the Indies; and even with regard to that trade, they are little better than factors to the Engli&s;h, French, Dutch, and Italians. Smuggling, which was formerly carried to a great height, is now, in a great mea&s;ure, &s;uppre&s;&s;ed. Since the year 1750, the exportation of &s;ilver hath been allowed, on the payment of three per cent. From 1735 almo&s;t to 1756, the flotas and galleons were di&s;continued, and the trade to America carried on in regi&s;ter-&s;hips, which any merchant might &s;end, on permi&s;&s;ion obtained from the council of the Indies; but then the flotas and galleons were re&s;tored. The A&s;&s;ogue &s;hips are two ve&s;&s;els which carry quick&s;ilver, on the king's account, to Vera Cruz. There is a company which has an exclu&s;ive grant for trading to the Ca|raccas, and another for trading to Porto Rico, the Bay of Honduras, the province of Guatimala, and Hi&s;paniola; but the Spani&s;h part of the la&s;t, it is &s;aid, hath been lately ceded to the French; and, by the la&s;t peace concluded with France and Spain, the Engli&s;h are not to be mole&s;ted in cutting logwood in the bay of Honduras. One &s;hip, and &s;ometimes two, &s;ails annually from Ma|nilla, in the i&s;land of Luconia, one of the Phi|lippines, for Acapulco, in Mexico: her cargo, which belongs to the convents, con&s;i&s;ts of the principal commodities of that part of the world; but the return from Acapulco is, for the mo&s;t part, made in money, and amounts to a va&s;t &s;um, as ap|peared from the trea&s;ure found on board the Aca|pulco &s;hip taken by Lord An&s;on. The city of Manilla was taken in the late war by the Engli&s;h, under General Draper and Admiral Pococke, and ran&s;omed by the Spaniards; but the ran&s;om hath never yet been paid, or only in part. In return for the manufactures &s;ent to America, the Spaniards receive gold, &s;ilver, cochineal, indigo, the cocoa or
<PB N="269" REF="2710">
chocolate nut, logwood, and other dying woods, &s;ugar, tobacco, &s;nuff, and other productions of that part of the world; &s;upplying mo&s;t part of Europe and A&s;ia with the &s;ilver they bring from thence in their galleons. In the time of the Moors and Goths, this kingdom was exceeding populous. It is &s;aid then to have contained between twenty and thirty millions; whereas now, it does not con|tain above &s;even or eight: and this, among other cau&s;es, is owing to the pride and lazine&s;s of the inhabitants, want of manufactures, and good regu|lations, neglect of the mines and agriculture, the expul&s;ion of the Moors, the peopling of America, heavy taxes, the great number of convents, exce&s;|&s;ive venery, and the con&s;equent infecundity of both &s;exes. Their debauchery and &s;terility are partly occa&s;ioned by their way of living; for they make great u&s;e of &s;pices, and drink a great deal of cho|colate, and &s;trong wine mixed with brandy. The cau&s;es a&s;&s;igned for the want of people in Spain will account, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, for its poverty; not|with&s;tanding it is computed, that it receives, one year with another, &s;etting a&s;ide other &s;ums, above twenty-&s;ix millions of pieces of eight, in regi&s;tered gold and &s;ilver. As mo&s;t of the manufactures that are &s;ent to America are furni&s;hed by England, France, Italy, and Holland; &s;o a great part of the trea|&s;ure brought home by the galleons is paid to the merchants of tho&s;e nations.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>COINS.</HEAD>
<P>Accounts in Spain are kept in reals, and mara|vidies de plata or &s;ilver, which are imaginary coins, thirty-four maravidies making a real, equal in value to about five-pence halfpenny. The gold coins are pi&s;toles, or doubloons, value about &s;eventeen &s;hil|lings; double and quadruple, half and quarter
<PB N="270" REF="2720">
pi&s;toles. The &s;ilver coins are reals de plata, or &s;ilver, worth &s;omewhat above &s;ix-pence of our money; pi|a&s;tres, or pieces of eight, worth about four &s;hillings and &s;ix-pence; half and quarter pieces of eight, but the&s;e are rare. They have al&s;o &s;mall bra&s;s money called quartos and octavos, like our half|pence and farthings. The Spani&s;h e&s;cudos, or crowns, and ducats, are imaginary coins, and both of the value of about &s;ix &s;hillings of our money. There are al&s;o imaginary pia&s;ters and pi&s;toles.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>CONSTITUTION.</HEAD>
<P>With regard to the con&s;titution of Spain, it is at pre&s;ent an ab&s;olute hereditary monarchy, where the females inherit in default of the males. The king, in his title, enumerates mo&s;t of the provinces, and particular parts of the dominions he has been, or is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of. In &s;peaking of him, he is commonly called his catholic maje&s;ty, or the catholic king. The hereditary prince is commonly &s;tiled prince of A&s;turias, and the other royal children infants. The kings of Spain are never crowned; they &s;eem to have a power to di&s;po&s;e of the crown to what branch of the royal family they plea&s;e, of which we have an in&s;tance, when Charles II. gave his do|minions to the duke of Anjou. For the admini|&s;tration of the government, and of ju&s;tice, here are &s;everal councils and tribunals; as the junta, or cabinet-council, the privy-council, the council of war, the council of Ca&s;tile, the council of the in|qui&s;ition, the council of the Indies, the &s;even courts of royal audiences, &amp;c. Since the beginning of the &s;eventeenth century, and the reign of Philip III. the cortes, or parliaments of this kingdom, have been di&s;continued. The higher nobility here con|&s;i&s;ts of counts, marqui&s;&s;es, and dukes. The gran|dees, who have precedence of all others, next the
<PB N="271" REF="2730">
king and princes of the blood, are named out of the&s;e. Like tho&s;e of Portugal, they have the pri|vilege of being covered in the king's pre&s;ence, who &s;tiles them in his letters, illu&s;trious; and in &s;peak|ing to them, or of them, their eminences: but there are others, be&s;ide the grandees, who are co|vered in the king's pre&s;ence, as cardinals, nun|cios, archbi&s;hops, the grand-prior of Ca&s;tile, and the grand-prior of Malta, the generals of the orders of St. Dominic and St. Francis, amba&s;&s;adors of crowned heads, the knights of the golden-fleece, and of the three military orders of St. James, Ca|latrava, and Alcantara, when the king a&s;&s;i&s;ts at their re&s;pective chapters, in quality of grand|ma&s;ter. No grandee can be apprehended for any crime, but by the expre&s;s order of the king, and they have many other privileges be&s;ides the&s;e. The in|ferior nobility &s;tile them&s;elves cavalleros and hi|dalgos.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>ORDERS of KINGHTHOOD.</HEAD>
<P>Of the orders in Spain, that of the golden-fleece is the principal, which was in&s;tituted in 1430 by Philip the Good, duke of Burgundy, and is com|mon now to the kings of Spain and the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria. The order of St. Jago de Compo&s;tella was in&s;tituted in the year 1175, by Ferdinand II. king of Leon. The order of Calatrava was found|ed by Sancho III. of Ca&s;tile. The order of Alcan|tara owes its in&s;titution to Ferdinand II. king of Leon. The three la&s;t orders have large comman|deries, or e&s;tates annexed to them. The ma&s;ters of them were once &s;o powerful, that they di&s;puted the king's authority over them: whereupon the king procured tho&s;e ma&s;ter&s;hips to be conferred on him&s;elf by the pope, that they might no longer
<PB N="272" REF="2740">
a&s;&s;ume an independency of the &s;tate. The knights of the&s;e three orders are e&s;teemed noblemen.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>REVENUES and FORCES.</HEAD>
<P>In the la&s;t century the revenues of Spain amount|ed to thirty-two or thirty-three millions of livres; but at the death of Charles II. they were &s;o reduced, that they did not exceed &s;even or eight millions. At pre&s;ent, the revenues of the crown ari&s;ing in Spain are computed at five millions &s;terling per annum, be&s;ides what ari&s;es from America. The &s;ilver mines there are inexhau&s;tible, and of the produce of the&s;e a fifth belongs to the king. The taxes in Spain are numerous and heavy. The land forces, in time of peace, are computed at about eighty thou&s;and; and in time of war, mu&s;t be much more numerous. Their navy at pre&s;ent, con&s;i&s;ts of a|bout forty men of war, frigates, and chebecs. Many of their men of war are now built at the Ha|vannah, and of cedar. When the Engli&s;h took the Havannah in the la&s;t war, they found &s;everal &s;uch there.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>LANGUAGE, and CHARACTER.</HEAD>
<P>With re&s;pect to the language of this country, it approaches, e&s;pecially that &s;poken in Ca&s;tile, which is by far the pure&s;t, the neare&s;t to the Latin of any language in Europe, mixed with Arabic words and terminations, introduced by the Moors. In &s;ome provinces the vulgar tongue is a dialect of the old French, or rather Ga&s;con, which is little under&s;tood in the others. In Bi&s;cay the language is &s;aid to be a dialect of the Gothic or Celtic, and to have &s;ome analogy with the Welch and Iri&s;h. As to what regards the character of the Spaniards, they do not want either an inclination or capacity
<PB N="273" REF="2750">
for the &s;ciences, but have hardly any opportunity of acquiring any true learning or knowledge, at lea&s;t in their &s;chools and univer&s;ities. They are admired for their &s;ecrecy, con&s;tancy, gravity, pa|tience in adver&s;ity, and loyalty. They are al&s;o &s;aid to be true to their words, great enemies to lying, temperate in eating and drinking, and &s;o nice and jealous in point of honour, that they will &s;tick at nothing to wipe off any &s;tain that is ca&s;t upon it. Among their vices and defects are reckoned their pride, and contempt of foreigners, their indolence, lazine&s;s, lu&s;t, bigotry, and credulity in believing the feigned miracles and legends of their monks. They are al&s;o &s;aid to be extremely pa&s;&s;ionate, jealous, and vindictive; and are noted, above any other European nation, for their contempt of, and aver|&s;ion to, agriculture, arts, and manufactures.</P>
<P>As for the dominions and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of Spain in A&s;ia, Africa, and America, we &s;hall give an ac|count of them, when we come to treat of the&s;e quarters of the globe. The kingdom of Spain it|&s;elf con&s;i&s;ts of fourteen provinces and &s;ome i&s;lands, which we &s;hall de&s;cribe in order, beginning from the north.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>The KINGDOM of GALICIA.</HEAD>
<P>This province, which was formerly a kingdom, is bounded on the we&s;t by the ocean; on the ea&s;t by A&s;turia and Leon; on the north by the bay of Bi&s;cay; and on the &s;outh by Portugal. It is &s;up|po&s;ed to have had its name from its antient inha|bitants the Gauls. Its figure is almo&s;t &s;quare, ex|tending about one hundred and twenty miles every way; but it is but thinly inhabited, except on the &s;ea-coa&s;t, where there is a great number of ports, and &s;everal promontories, e&s;pecially that noted one
<PB N="274" REF="2760">
called Cape Fini&s;terre. The province is well &s;tored with cattle, hogs, mules, and hor&s;es; yielding al&s;o wine, wood for firing, and timber for &s;hips and hou&s;es, &s;ome flax, lemons, wheat, millet, large turneps, all kinds of herbs, and fine marble; but its mines of gold and &s;ilver are either exhau&s;ted, or neglected. It is a mountainous country, and one of the colde&s;t and poore&s;t in Spain; but well watered by many rivers, and &s;maller &s;treams. Of the former the principal are, the Minho, the Ulla, the Tambra, and the Mandeo, which, with the neighbouring &s;ea, abound with fi&s;h, particularly &s;ardines and &s;almon. The principal places in this province are,</P>
<P>Compo&s;tella, or St. Jago de Compo&s;tella, the capital, and an archbi&s;hop's &s;ee. It is &s;ituated be|twixt the rivers Tambra and Ulla, having a &s;trong ca&s;tle and walls, and containing &s;everal fair &s;treets, &s;quares, mona&s;teries, ho&s;pitals, colleges, and churches. The archbi&s;hop is ab&s;olute both in &s;pi|rituals and temporals, and has a revenue of &s;ixty thou&s;and ducats per annum. The cathedral is a mo&s;t magnificent &s;tructure, and contains the pre|tended body of the apo&s;tle James the younger, the tutelary &s;aint and patron of all Spain. There is a prodigious concour&s;e of pilgrims always at this place, to pay their devotions to the &s;hrine of the &s;aint, on who&s;e account the cathedral hath been enriched with a con&s;tant flow of rich offerings and gifts, and di&s;tingui&s;hed by many privileges, as well as the town. All the dignitaries, and &s;even of the canons, have the title of cardinals, and are allowed to &s;ay pontifical ma&s;s in St. James's chapel; and the &s;ee is independent of any but that of Rome. Here al&s;o is an univer&s;ity, erected in 1532, a court of inqui&s;ition, a &s;overeign court, two annual fairs, and a market every week. The chief of the ho&s;|pitals is that for the reception of pilgrims. From
<PB N="275" REF="2770">
this city the order of St. Jago takes its name. The effigy of that apo&s;tle, in the cathedral, is &s;upported by four kings of Spain, and &s;ix angels, mounted on as many columns.</P>
<P>Lugo, antiently called Lucus Augu&s;ti, whence its pre&s;ent name was formed, a &s;mall city, about &s;eventy miles ea&s;t of Compo&s;tella. It is the &s;ee of a bi&s;hop, who is &s;uffragan to St. Jago, and has a revenue of eighteen thou&s;and ducats. Here are many warm baths, &s;ome of which are only luke|warm, and others boiling hot. This town is in|clo&s;ed with a &s;trong wall, &s;o broad, that two coaches may go abrea&s;t upon it; and its neighbourhood produces turneps of fifty pounds weight, and very well ta&s;ted.</P>
<P>Corunna, antiently Brigantium, a &s;ea-port town on the Bay of Bi&s;cay, called by our &s;eamen the Groyne. It is a place of con&s;iderable trade, having a &s;pacious harbour, with walls and forts, &s;everal convents, chapels, churches, and ho&s;pitals. In its neighbourhood is a quarry of ja&s;per. It &s;tands thirty miles north of Compo&s;tella, and is the &s;eat of the governor, and royal audience of Galicia.</P>
<P>Tui, a walled city on the river Minho, about forty miles &s;outh of Compo&s;tella, and not far from Vulen&ccedil;a in Portugal. It is the &s;ee of a bi&s;hop, who has a revenue of ten thou&s;and ducats, and enjoys a good air, being delightfully &s;ituated a|mid&s;t gardens and vineyards.</P>
<P>Oren&s;e, another epi&s;copal city, &s;tanding al&s;o on the Minho, over which it has a &s;trong bridge, forty miles &s;outh-ea&s;t from Compo&s;tella. The Romans, according to &s;ome, called it Aquae Calidae Calden&s;es, and Urentes; but according to others, Aquae Celeniae, and Alinae, from the hot &s;prings in and about it. From Urentes its pre&s;ent name is &s;uppo&s;ed to have been formed. The bi&s;hop is &s;uffragan to St. Jago, and has a revenue of ten
<PB N="276" REF="2780">
thou&s;and ducats per annum. The &s;prings of this place, &s;ome of which are boiling hot, are &s;alutary in &s;everal di&s;tempers. The neighbouring country a|bounds in wine and fine fruit.</P>
<P>Mondonnedo, a &s;mall city, &s;eventy miles north of Compo&s;tella, and about &s;ixteen from the &s;ea|coa&s;t. It is the &s;ee of a bi&s;hop, who is lord of the city, &s;uffragan to St. Jago, and has an income of &s;even thou&s;and ducats.</P>
<P>Betanzos, a city on the river Mandeo, with a good harbour, to the northward of Corunna. It is walled, and &s;uppo&s;ed by &s;ome to be the Brigan|tium of Ptolemy, and the Flavium Brigantium of Dio Ca&s;&s;ius.</P>
<P>Vigo, a town on a &s;mall bay, where the Eng|li&s;h and Dutch, in 1702, took, or burnt, the Spani&s;h plate-fleet.</P>
<P>Ferrol, a hand&s;ome town, with a fine harbour, two leagues from Corunna.</P>
<P>Monrorte de Lemos, a town belonging, toge|ther with the county, of which it is the capital, to the cond&eacute;, or count of Lemos, who has a &s;tately &s;eat here. On a high mountain, in its neighbour|hood, is a &s;pring, that ebbs and flows with the &s;ea, and is &s;ometimes hot, and &s;ometimes cold.</P>
<P>Fini&s;terre, a &s;mall town near the cape of that name.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>The PRINCIPALITY of the ASTURIAS.</HEAD>
<P>This principality is bounded by Bi&s;cay on the ea&s;t; by Galicia on the we&s;t; by Old Ca&s;tile and Leon on the &s;outh; and by the &s;ea on the north. It is about one hundred and ten miles in length, and fifty-four in breadth; being divided into A&s;tu|ria d' Cviedo, and A&s;turia de Santillana, which together are called the A&s;turias. On the &s;outh it is &s;eparated from Old Ca&s;tile and Leon by high
<PB N="277" REF="2790">
mountains covered with woods. The province is but thinly inhabited, yet yields plenty of fruit, and excellent wine; nor is it de&s;titute of grain. The inhabitants value them&s;elves much on their being the genuine de&s;cendants of the Goths; and, on this account, are al&s;o much honoured by the re&s;t of the nation, tho&s;e of them e&s;pecially who inha|bit the mountain of Au&s;ena, where Pelayo, the Gothic prince, defeated the Moors. The&s;e, tho' poor pea&s;ants, and fain to go into the other pro|vinces to find work, yet call them&s;elves illu&s;trious Goths, and Mountaineers, and think it ignomi|nious to intermarry even with great and rich fa|milies of another race. This pride hath been fed and flattered not only by the particular privileges be&s;towed upon them, but by the re&s;pect paid them by the re&s;t of the nation, and by the courting, and even purcha&s;ing of their alliance. The A&s;tu|rias are al&s;o di&s;tingui&s;hed by giving title to the he|reditary prince of Spain. The places of mo&s;t note in them are,</P>
<P>Oviedo, antiently called Brigetum, the capital, &s;ituated about twenty miles from the Bay of Bi&s;cay, between the Little Ove and Duva, from the former of which it is &s;uppo&s;ed to take its name. It is the &s;ee of a bi&s;hop, who is immediately &s;ubject to the pope, and has an income of twelve thou&s;and ducats. Here is al&s;o an univer&s;ity, founded in 1580, &s;eve|ral convents, chapels, churches, and ho&s;pitals: and here Pelayo, and the fir&s;t Chri&s;tian kings, after the conque&s;t of Spain by the Moors, re&s;ided. The neighbouring country is very mountainous, but abounds in grain, cattle, and che&s;nut trees. The town has &s;trong walls, and is the &s;eat of the royal audience for the province.</P>
<P>Gyon, a &s;mall town near the &s;ea, with a good wall, ca&s;tle, and port. It was called by the Ro|mans Arae Sextiae, or Se&s;tinae, and was once the

<P>Santillana, in Latin, Fanum Stae Julianae, a &s;mall town on the Bay of Bi&s;cay, belonging to the duke del' Infantado, to whom it gives the title of marquis. It is &s;uppo&s;ed to be the Caulana, or Caucana, of the Greek and Roman authors. It was once called Llanjulian, which, as well as its Latin name, &s;ignifies the church of St. Julian; Llan, in the old Ba&s;que, or Bi&s;cayan, &s;ignifying a church, as it does in the Briti&s;h or Welch.</P>
<P>St. Andero, formerly Portus Sti Emederi, a &s;mall town, with a large, &s;ecure, and well forti|fied harbour, which, however, has a dangerous rock at the entrance. A great many fi&s;hermen live in the &s;uburbs.</P>
<P>The earldom of Liebana, in this province, be|longing to the dukes del' Infantado, is one of the mo&s;t craggy and mountainous parts of Spain, &s;o that the Moors could never get footing in it; yet produces plenty of corn, wine, fruit, cattle, and game.</P>

<P>This province is bounded to the north by the Bay of Bi&s;cay; to the &s;outh by Old Ca&s;tile; to the we&s;t by the A&s;turias; and to the ea&s;t by the French and Spani&s;h Navarre: its extent from we&s;t to ea&s;t being about one hundred and &s;ixteen miles, and from north to &s;outh about eighty, where broade&s;t. The &s;oil here is very unequal: in &s;ome places they have &s;uch plenty of apples, that cyder is the com|mon drink of the inhabitants; in others, particu|larly on the &s;ea-coa&s;t, they have oranges and le|mons in great plenty, and &s;ell them very cheap;

but though the country in general is mountainous and barren, be&s;ides the abovementioned products, &s;ome flax, corn, and wine are produced in the val|lies, and &s;tore of excellent timber on the moun|tains; which yield al&s;o lead, and the be&s;t iron in the world, which is exported to a large amount, either unwrought, or wrought into all &s;orts of iron work, e&s;pecially &s;words and fire arms. The inha|bitants are reckoned the be&s;t &s;ailors and &s;oldiers in Spain, and enjoy many privileges. They are of Cel|tic or Gothic extract, and have pre&s;erved more of their antient genius, laws, government, manners, and, we may add, of their language, than perhaps any other people in Europe, unle&s;s we &s;hould ex|cept the Welch, Scotch Highlanders, or wild Iri&s;h, who are of the &s;ame origin, and who&s;e language comes the neare&s;t of any other to the Bi&s;cayan. This province contains Bi&s;cay Proper, Guipu&s;coa, and Alaba, or Alava. In the fir&s;t of the&s;e the principal places are,</P>
<P>Ordunna, which, though &s;mall, is the only place in the province that is dignified with the name of city. It &s;tands about eighteen miles from the &s;ea, and is &s;urrounded with high mountains.</P>
<P>Bilbao, vulgarly called Bilboa, the capital of the province, though no city, plea&s;antly &s;ituated on the river Ybai&ccedil;abal, &s;ix miles from the &s;ea, where it has a good port, and a great trade in iron, wrought and unwrought, wool, &s;affron, and che&s;nuts. It is large and populous, &s;tanding where was formerly the Portus Amanus, and taking its name from a ford near the town, as having been at fir&s;t called Bello Vado, which was at la&s;t cor|rupted into Bilbao or Bilboa. They &s;uffer none to &s;ettle here, nor indeed in the re&s;t of the province, and &s;ome other parts of Spain, but &s;uch as can prove that they are de&s;cended from the antient Gothic Chri&s;tians, and that their blood is untained with that of Jews or Moors.</P>

<HEAD>In GUIPUSCOA the principal places are,</HEAD>
<P>San Seba&s;tian, a pretty large town, and noted port, on the Bay of Bi&s;cay, at the mouth of the little river Gurumea, by the antients called Me|na&s;cum. The town is hand&s;ome, well-fortified, and has a good harbour and citadel, carrying on al&s;o a con&s;iderable trade in iron, &s;teel, and wool, and enjoying a plea&s;ant pro&s;pect of the &s;ea on one &s;ide, and the Pyrenean mountains on the other. Here is a company which trades to the Caraccas.</P>
<P>Fuentarabia, in Latin, Fon&s;rabidus, a little neat town on the utmo&s;t borders of Spain, next to France, from which it is &s;eparated only by the river Bida&s;&s;oa, or Vida&s;&s;o, at the mouth whereof it &s;tands. It has a pretty good harbour, and is fortified both by nature and art. Its name is a contraction of Fuentarrabaya, which, &s;ome &s;ay, &s;ignifies the &s;trand of the &s;pring or river. The i&s;land of Phea&s;ants in the river Bida&s;&s;ao, mentioned in our account of France, and famous on account of the peace of the Pyrenees, concluded there in 1659, and the treaty of marriage between Lewis XIV. and Maria The|re&s;ia, infanta of Spain, lies about nine miles from this town.</P>
<P>Tolo&s;a, called by the French Tolo&s;ette, to di&s;tingui&s;h it from Tholou&s;e, the capital of Lan|guedoc, a hand&s;ome town, twelve miles &s;outh of St. Seba&s;tian, at the conflux of the Araxas and Oria.</P>

<P>Alaba produces rye, barley, &s;everal kinds of fruits and wine, with rich iron and &s;teel mines; but the only place worth mentioning in it is Vitoria, the capital, which is &s;urrounded with a wall, and carries on a great trade in iron, &s;teel, wool, wine, and &s;word-blades. The mona&s;teries in it are mag|nificent, particularly that of St. Francis.</P>

<HEAD>The KINGDOM of NAVARRE.</HEAD>
<P>This is only a part of the antient kingdom of Navarre, (which was erected &s;oon after the inva&s;ion of the Moors) and is otherwi&s;e called Upper-Na|varre, to di&s;tingui&s;h it from Lower-Navarre, be|longing to the French. Its name is &s;uppo&s;ed to be a contraction of nava errea, &s;ignifying, in the lan|guage of the Va&s;cones its antient inhabitants, a land of vallies. It borders to the &s;outh on Arragon; to the north by the Pyrenees, by which and Arragon it is bounded al&s;o to the ea&s;t; and to the we&s;t it has Old-Ca&s;tile and Bi&s;cay: extending from &s;outh to north about eighty miles, and from ea&s;t to we&s;t about &s;eventy-five. As this country lies among the Pyrenees, it abounds in &s;heep and cattle, game of all kinds, as boars, &s;tags, and roe-bucks, and in wild-fowl, hor&s;es, and honey, yielding al&s;o &s;ome grain, wine, oil, and a variety of minerals, medici|nal waters, and hot-baths.

No part of the revenues of this province goes into the king's trea&s;ury; but mu&s;t all be em|ployed, pur&s;uant to a compact, in the public &s;ervice. The principal places in it are,</P>
<P>Pampelona, the capital, &s;ituated at the foot of the Pyrenees, and walled. It is &s;aid to have been built by Pompey the Great, and from hence called Pompeiopolis. It is the &s;ee of a bi&s;hop, who is &s;ubject to the archbi&s;hop of Burgos, and has a re|venue of twenty-eight thou&s;and ducats. Here is an univer&s;ity founded in 1608, two ca&s;tles, &s;everal churches, and a great many convents. Two high roads lead from this city, over the Pyrenees, to France; one to Bayonne, through the valley of Batan, and the other, which is the be&s;t, to St. Jean pie de Port, by the way of Taraffa.</P>

It is in general a barren country, producing little, except where it is watered by the rivers, or by art; and there it yields corn, wine, oil, flax, and, in &s;ome places, &s;affron. It was erected into a kingdom in the beginning of the eleventh century. The places of mo&s;t note in it are,</P>

<HEAD>The KINGDOM of LEON.</HEAD>
<P>This kingdom took its name from its metropolis. It is bounded on the north by the A&s;turias, on the &s;outh by E&s;tremadura, on the we&s;t by Galicia and Portugal, and on the ea&s;t by Old-Ca&s;tile; its length from north to &s;outh being about an hundred

It is diver&s;ified with high hills, &s;pacious vallies, and champain plains, and produces excellent wheat, and other grain, good pa&s;ture, wine, oil, honey, and fruits. Here are al&s;o abundance of cattle, game, and fowl, mines of turquoi&s;es, quarries of marble, alaba&s;ter, and ja&s;per, with &s;ome garnets and amethy&s;ts. There are many &s;mall rivers in the province, be&s;ides the Douro, which divides it almo&s;t into two equal parts. The dukes of Nagera are hereditary-gover|nors of it; and the chief cities and towns, and other remarkable places, contained in it are,</P>
<P>Leon, the capital of the province, &s;ituate an hun|dred and &s;ixty-five miles north-we&s;t from Madrid, at the foot of the A&s;turian mountains. From a Roman legion &s;ettled here, in the time of Trajan, it had the name of Legio, whence its pre&s;ent name was formed. It &s;tands in a plea&s;ant country, and is well built, though after the antient manner, and contains a great many convents and chapels, with &s;everal ho&s;pitals, and one of the fine&s;t cathedrals in Spain, of which the king is always a canon, as well as the marquis of A&s;torga. The bi&s;hop, who is immediately &s;ubject to the pope, has a revenue of twelve thou&s;and ducats. Thirty-&s;even kings of Spain, and one emperor, be&s;ides &s;everal &s;aints, are &s;aid to be interred in the cathedral.

<HEAD>The PROVINCE of ESTREMADURA.</HEAD>
<P>This province is bounded by that of the &s;ame name in Portugal, to the we&s;t; by New-Ca&s;tile to the ea&s;t; by Leon to the north; and by Andalu&s;ia to the &s;outh: extending from ea&s;t to we&s;t, at mo&s;t, about an hundred and ten miles, and from &s;outh to north upwards of an hundred and thirty. The &s;oil yields abundance of grain, wine, and fruits, and rich pa&s;turage; but good water is wanting in many places. The &s;ummers are exce&s;&s;ively hot here. The rivers Taio and Guadiana, running through it from ea&s;t to we&s;t, divide it into three parts. There are &s;ome of the fine&s;t and riche&s;t plains here not only in Spain, but perhaps in the world; being covered with the greate&s;t variety of fruit|trees which Europe affords, inter&s;per&s;ed with olive|groves, vineyards, gardens, orchards, meadows, and fields, and producing not only wheat and other grain, but flax, honey, &s;affron, and &s;ilk: the pa&s;tures are &s;o luxuriant and large, that great numbers of cattle are driven from the other pro|vinces to graze in it. Though this province is now united to New-Ca&s;tile, we thought it would be proper to treat of it &s;eparately. The places of mo&s;t note in it are,</P>
<P>Merida, antiently Augu&s;ta-Emerita, &s;o called from Augu&s;tus, the founder, who built and erect|ed it into a colony for his old &s;oldiers, called Emeriti; though Dio Ca&s;&s;ius tells us, that it was built by the &s;oldiers them&s;elves, and called, in honour of the emperor, Augu&s;ta-Emerita. It af|terwards made a great figure, and was the ca|pital of the whole province of Lu&s;itania. It &s;tands on the Anas, now Guadiana, over which it has a

<P>Badajoz, now the large&s;t city in the province, and well fortified, &s;tanding on the &s;outh &s;ide of the Guadiana, on the frontiers of Portugal, about one hundred and fifty miles &s;outh-we&s;t from Madrid, and forty we&s;t from Merida. In the Roman times it was called Pax Augu&s;ta, and Colonia Pacon&s;is, the former of which was corrupted by the Moors to Bax-Augos, and afterwards to Badajoz. Here is a fine old Roman bridge of &s;tone, &s;ome hand|&s;ome &s;treets, churches, and mona&s;teries, and two modern ca&s;tles, with the &s;ee of a bi&s;hop, who is &s;uffragan to the archbi&s;hop of Compo&s;tella, and has a revenue of &s;ixteen thou&s;and ducats.</P>
<P>Plazencia, a beautiful well-built city and bi|&s;hop's &s;ee, on the banks of the little river Xerte, over which it hath three bridges, about &s;eventy miles &s;outh-we&s;t from Madrid, and one hundred and twenty &s;outh from Merida. It takes its name from the delightfulne&s;s of its &s;ituation, in the mid&s;t of that mo&s;t delicious &s;pot called La Vera de Plazencia, or the orchard of Plazencia, which is diver&s;ified with beautiful &s;eats, villages, gardens, and groves of the fine&s;t citron, lemon, orange, and fig-trees. Here &s;everal of the antients placed the Ely&s;ian Fields, knowing of no place more agreeable; and here the emperor Charles V. having re&s;igned all his dominions, retired into the famous mona&s;tery of St. Ju&s;tus, where, after living two years a reclu&s;e, he ended his days. The bi&s;hop is &s;ubject to the archbi&s;hop of San Jago de Compo|&s;tella, and has a revenue of fifty thou&s;and ducats

<P>Alcantara, a &s;trong town &s;ituated on the Tagus, over which it hath a magnificent bridge, built in the days of the emperor Trajan, and belonging to the knights, who take their name from it. When the Moors took it, they gave it the name of Al|cantara, i. e. the &s;tone bridge. Either this town or one near it, was, in the times of the Romans, called Norba Cae&s;area, or Colonia Norben&s;is.

<HEAD>The KINGDOM of OLD-CASTILE.</HEAD>
<P>This province, in the time of the Romans, was a part of the Tarraconen&s;is. Afterwards it was an earldom, and, anno 1034, was rai&s;ed to a kingdom. The epithet of Old was given it, becau&s;e it was recovered from the Moors &s;ooner than the New. It is bounded to the &s;outh by New-Ca&s;tile, to the north by A&s;turia and Bi&s;cay to the we&s;t by Leon, and to the ea&s;t by Navarre and Arragon; its greate&s;t extent from &s;outh to north being about an hundred miles, and from ea&s;t to we&s;t, about one hundred and twenty. Though a mountain|ous country, the plains and vallies yield excellent wine, grain, and fruits, and both mountains and vallies yield al&s;o wood, and good pa&s;ture for &s;heep and cattle. The wool of the &s;heep is &s;aid to be the fine&s;t in Spain. The air on the mountains is bleak, but in the vallies generally very hot. Some of the mountains have their tops covered with &s;now all the &s;ummer, which is carried to the towns, and &s;old to cool their wine, as is the cu&s;tom all over Spain. The large&s;t rivers here are the Douro and Ebro, into which &s;everal le&s;&s;er ones fall, and the places of mo&s;t note are,</P>
<P>Burgos, the capital of the province, &s;ituated on an eminence by the little river Arlancon, over which it has a good bridge, about one hundred and twenty miles from Madrid to the north. It
<PB N="298" REF="3000">
is a large but not a fine city, though it has &s;ome hand&s;ome &s;quares, public buildings, and palaces. It is &s;aid to have nine months of winter, and three of hell, on account of their exce&s;&s;ive heat. Among other convents, here is one for ladies of quality, called Las Huelgas, the revenue of which is &s;aid to be eighty thou&s;and ducats per annum. The abbe&s;s, who is generally a lady of one of the fir&s;t families in Spain, has &s;eventeen other convents, fourteen towns, and fifty villages &s;ubject to her. She has al&s;o the di&s;po&s;al of twelve commanderies, and takes place of all ladies, except tho&s;e of the royal family. The cathedral here is one of the noble&s;t and riche&s;t in Spain. The archbi&s;hop has a revenue of forty thou&s;and ducats per annum; and the king is always the fir&s;t of the canons. There are a great many elegant fountains to &s;up|ply the city with water, the inhabitants of which are &s;aid to be more indu&s;trious, and to carry on a greater number of trades and manufactures than is common in other great cities of Spain. The walls are antient, but &s;trong. Among the ho&s;pitals is one for Pilgrims. On the north &s;ide on an almo&s;t inacce&s;&s;ible rock, &s;tands the citadel. This city, which was built in the ninth or tenth century, on the ruins of Auca, claims the precedence of all others in the cortes or parliament of Ca&s;tile.</P>
<P>Valladolid, a large, populous, walled city, plea&s;antly &s;ituated on the banks of the river Pi|&s;uerga, over which it has a &s;tately bridge, about an hundred miles from Madrid, to the north-we&s;t, and &s;ixty-&s;ix from Burgos, to the &s;outh. The etymon of its name is uncertain. Here is a great number of convents, ho&s;pitals, chapels, fountains, &s;quares, colleges, and churches, with an uni|ver&s;ity, the next in dignity to that of Salamanca, and the &s;ee of a bi&s;hop, who is &s;uffragan to the archbi&s;hop of Toledo, and has a revenue of twelve

Here is al&s;o a fine royal palace, a geographical academy, founded not many years ago, a court of inqui&s;ition, and a high court of ju&s;tice, &s;everal manufactures, and a con&s;iderable trade. The little river E&s;cue&s;a runs through the city, and has a large &s;tone-bridge over it.</P>
<P>Segovia, a very antient, and &s;till a large, opulent, populous, and hand&s;ome city, on the river Atyada, about thirty miles &s;outh of Madrid, and &s;ixty from Valladolid. The wealth of the city ari&s;es not only from the great number of noble families who make it their chief re&s;idence, but much more from its large commerce and manufactures, e&s;pe|cially tho&s;e of cloth and paper. A great deal of wool is al&s;o exported from hence. Here is the principal mint of Spain, in which it is &s;aid they can coin thirty thou&s;and ducats a day; a royal palace, (in which the duke de Ripperda was confined, till he made his e&s;cape) with an univer&s;ity, and a bi&s;hop|ric, the revenue of which is twenty-four thou&s;and ducats per annum. The Roman aqueduct here is a mo&s;t amazing fabric: it was built by the em|peror Trajan, and con&s;i&s;ts of two rows of &s;eventy-&s;ix lofty arches, carried from one mountain to another, and conveys water all over the city: notwith&s;tanding it has &s;tood &s;o many centuries, it &s;till retains its &s;trength and beauty; &s;o great was the art and &s;kill of the Romans in building beyond what the following ages could boa&s;t of.

<HEAD>The KINGDOM of NEW-CASTILE.</HEAD>
<P>This kingdom or province was in the days of the Romans a part of Hi&s;pania Tarraconen&s;is, and contained the territories of the antient Car|pitani, Oretani, Vaccei, and other le&s;&s;er tribes, and is now the fir&s;t and mo&s;t opulent province of Spain, as containing the capital, and being the &s;eat of the monarchy. It is parted by ridges of moun|tains on the north from Old - Ca&s;tile; on the we&s;t from E&s;tremadura; on the ea&s;t from Va|lentia and Arragon; and on the &s;outh from Anda|lu&s;ia. On the &s;outh and ea&s;t it is bounded al&s;o, in part, by Murcia. Its greate&s;t length, from &s;outh to north, is two hundred miles, and from ea&s;t to we&s;t, about one hundred and ninety. The air here, though very hot in &s;ummer, is healthy, and the &s;oil generally fertile, producing abund|ance of wheat and other grain, wine, pa&s;ture, fruit, and herbs. The province is al&s;o well &s;tored with cattle, wild and tame fowl, and its rivers, of which the principal are the Tagus, Guadalquiver, Xucar, Xarama, Guadarama, and Guadiana, furni&s;h it with fi&s;h. The dialect &s;poken here is e&s;teemed the pure&s;t and mo&s;t elegant of any in Spain. Both the Ca&s;tiles are &s;uppo&s;ed to have derived their names from the antient Ca&s;tellani, and the&s;e from the great number of ca&s;tles which were formerly in the country. The principal places in new Ca&s;tile are,</P>
<P><PB N="302" REF="3040">
Madrid, the capital of the whole monarchy of Spain, and the re&s;idence of the court, though it never had the title of a city. It &s;tands in the center of a large plain, &s;urrounded with moun|tains, and in the very heart of Spain, on the banks of the little river Manzanares, which is always very low and &s;hallow, except when it is &s;welled by the melting of the &s;now on the mountains. The &s;treets here are wide, &s;traight, and hand&s;ome, and adorned with &s;everal fine fountains; the hou&s;es fair and lofty; but built of brick, with lattice-windows, excepting tho&s;e of the rich, who have gla&s;s in their windows, only during the &s;um|mer heats they u&s;e gauze, or &s;ome &s;uch thin &s;tuff in&s;tead of it, to let in the fre&s;h air. There are two &s;tately bridges here over the Manzanares, &s;e|veral beautiful &s;quares, a great many magnificent churches, convents, palaces, and ho&s;pitals: a|mong the la&s;t is one for all nations and di&s;tempers, with a large revenue. Around the pla&ccedil;a-mayor, or grand &s;quare, are piazzas, with hou&s;es all uni|form, and a continued line of balconies, for view|ing the bull-fights and other public &s;hews exhi|bited in it. The royal palace, which &s;tands on the we&s;t &s;ide of the town, on an eminence, is &s;pa|cious and magnificent, con&s;i&s;ting of three courts, and commanding a fine pro&s;pect. At the ea&s;t|end of the town is the prado or pardo, which is a delightful plain, planted with regular rows of poplar trees, and watered with a great many foun|tains, where the nobility and gentry take the air on hor&s;eback, or in their coaches, and the common people on foot, or divert them&s;elves with a variety of &s;ports and exerci&s;es. The compa&s;s of the whole town is computed at about nine miles, and the number of its inhabitants at about one hundred and fifty thou&s;and. It is well &s;upplied with pro|vi&s;ions of all kinds, at rea&s;onable rates, and the

court, with the re&s;ort and re&s;idence of the quality, and the high colleges and offices that are kept here, occa&s;ion a bri&s;k trade and circulation of money. There are three royal academies here, one for the improvement of the Spani&s;h language, another for hi&s;tory, and another for medicine. Nothing, in &s;hort, is wanting to make this place extremely com|modious and agreeable, but cleanline&s;s which, it &s;eems, is not &s;uch a favourite with the inha|bitants as it de&s;erves. The environs are very plea&s;ant, and contain &s;everal royal &s;eats among which are El Buen retiro, Ca&s;a del Campo, Florida, Le Pardo, Sar&s;ue&s;a, and St. Ildefon&s;o; but the mo&s;t magnificent, not only in this country, but perhaps in the whole world, is the E&s;curial, which takes its name from a &s;mall village, near which it &s;tands, about twenty-two miles north-we&s;t from Madrid. It was built by Philip II. either in ho|nour of St. Laurence, on who&s;e fe&s;tival his forces obtained the victory of St. Quintin, anno 1575, or in con&s;equence of a vow he made to that &s;aint, if he &s;hould gain the victory. It is a va&s;t &s;pacious &s;tructure, all of curious white &s;peckled &s;tone, with ornaments of various &s;orts of marble, ja&s;per, &amp;c. It was twenty-two years in building, and has the appearance of a town, having, it is &s;aid, about eleven thou&s;and windows, and containing, be&s;ides the royal apartments and offices, a mo&s;t &s;plendid church, in which are forty chapels, and as many altars, rich beyond imagination, a convent of Jero|mites, a college, &s;everal ho&s;pitals or infirmaries, and a noble library, containing a large and choice collection of books in all languages and fa|culties. Here al&s;o is the burial-place of the kings and queens of Spain, called the Pantheon, which, amid&s;t all its riches and &s;plendor, is an affecting monument of the vanity and tran&s;itorine&s;s of hu|man grandeur. In fine, it is &s;aid, that it would take up above four whole days to go through all

the rooms and apartments of this palace, which for variety of marble, ja&s;per, and other curious &s;tone, for paintings, &s;culpture, tape&s;try, plate, both of gold and &s;ilver, and gems, exceeds all imagina|tion. Another royal palace greatly admired, par|ticularly for its delicious gardens and &s;urpri&s;ing water-works, is Aranjuez, which is &s;ituated on the Tagus, about thirty miles &s;outh of Madrid.</P>
<P>Toledo, an antient, large, and well fortified city on the Tagus, about thirty-&s;ix miles to the &s;outh of Madrid.

In later times it was the metropolis of Spain, and the re&s;idence of &s;everal Gothic, Moori&s;h, and Chri&s;tian kings. The air here is &s;aid to be exceeding healthy and &s;erene, and pro|vi&s;ions extremely cheap and plentiful. Here are many &s;tately edifices, &s;quares, convents, churches, and ho&s;pitals, with three noble bridges over the river, an univer&s;ity founded in 1475, a court of inqui&s;ition, a royal palace, manufactures of &s;word|blades, &s;ilks, and woollen &s;tuffs, and the &s;ee of an archbi&s;hop, who is primate of all Spain, and has a revenue, one year with another, of three hundred thou&s;and ducats. The cathedral al&s;o has a revenue of about one hundred thou&s;and ducats, and is a &s;tately &s;tructure, all of a beautiful white &s;tone, enriched with &s;culpture. The roof of it is &s;upported by eighty-eight &s;tately columns, and it has eight large and beautiful gates of bra&s;s, with above thirty chapels, &s;ome of them large enough to pa&s;s for hand&s;ome churches. The church-trea|&s;ury is of ine&s;timable value; eight bu&s;hels of bread are every day di&s;tributed here, and there are, in the whole, above &s;ix hundred per&s;ons belonging to the church.

In &s;ome places they have five crops in a year of wheat and other grain, with &s;ugar-canes, maiz, or Indian corn, grapes, olives, and mulberry trees for &s;ilk worms. The chief rivers in this province, are the Guadalaviar, Segura, Xucar, Cabriel, Oliara, Morviedro, and Millares, all which fall into the Me|diterranean. The province of Valentia was re|covered from the Moors, anno 1238. It is &s;aid the king cannot rai&s;e any taxes in it without the con&s;ent of the three e&s;tates. The chief towns are,</P>
<P>Valentia, the capital, lying on the Guadalaviar, over which it has five &s;tately bridges, about two miles from the &s;ea, and one hundred and eighty &s;outh-ea&s;t from Madrid. It is a large, beau|tiful, populous city, having a port about a mile and a half from it, and carrying on a con&s;i|derable trade. Here al&s;o is an univer&s;ity, a tribu|nal of inqui&s;ition, a &s;overeign court of judicature, and the &s;ee of an archbi&s;hop, who has a revenue of forty thou&s;and ducats, a woollen manufacture of cloth, which is &s;aid to be the fine&s;t in all Spain: va&s;t quantities of almonds al&s;o are exported from hence.

Its pre&s;ent name is thought to be a corruption of Auriolla, i. e. The Pot of Gold, as it was called by the Romans, on account of the gold mines that were formerly about it.

<HEAD>The PROVINCE of ANDALUSIA.</HEAD>
<P>This province comprehends the three antient Moori&s;h kingdoms of Seville, Cordova, and Jaen, and the greate&s;t part of the Roman province called antiently Baetica. Andalu&s;ia is a corruption of Vandalenhaus, i. e. the hou&s;e or abode of the Van|dais. This name it had from the Vandals, by whom the greate&s;t part of Spain was over-run. The province we are now to treat of, is &s;ometimes called Lower-Andalu&s;ia, to di&s;tingui&s;h it from the
<PB N="309" REF="3120">
kingdom of Granada, &s;tiled al&s;o Upper-Andalu&s;ia. The former is bounded on the north by E&s;trema|dura and New Ca&s;tile; on the &s;outh by the Medi|terranean &s;ea, and the Streights of Gibraltar; on the we&s;t by Portugal; and on the ea&s;t by Granada and Murcia. Its whole length from ea&s;t to we&s;t is about two hundred and forty miles; but its great|e&s;t breadth is not one hundred and thirty. The principal rivers are, the Guadalquiver, Olim Baetis, Tarte&s;&s;us, Guadiana, Guadiamar, Guada|late, Xenil, Odier, and Tinto, or Azeche. The water of the la&s;t of the&s;e, it is &s;aid, cannot be &s;afely drank, nor has it any fi&s;h, or other living crea|ture in it. No province in Spain exceeds this in number of inhabitants, commodious harbours, fertility of &s;oil, wealth, and commerce. It abounds in grain, wine, oil, oranges, citrons, rai&s;ins, al|monds, figs, pomegranates, &s;alt, &s;ugar, &s;carlet|berries for dying, &s;ilk, honey, quick&s;ilver, cinna|bar, and formerly it had rich mines of gold, &s;ilver, and ba&s;e metals, which have been wholly neglected &s;ince the di&s;covery of America. It is al&s;o noted for breeding the fine&s;t and fleete&s;t hor&s;es in all Spain. The chief di&s;advantage attending it is the exce&s;&s;ive heat in &s;ummer, &s;o that the inhabitants generally follow their employments by night, and &s;leep by day.</P>

<HEAD>In that part of it called the kingdom of SEVILLE, the places of mo&s;t note are,</HEAD>
<P>Seville, the capital, in Latin, Hi&s;palis, &s;tand|ing on the Guadalquiver, two hundred miles &s;outh|we&s;t from Madrid, and fifty-&s;even from the mouth of the river. It was antiently the capital of Baeti|ca; and from Julius Cae&s;ar, who beautified and enlarged it, it was called Julia Romula: afterwards it was the re&s;idence of &s;everal Gothic and Moori&s;h
<PB N="301" REF="3130">
kings. There is a bridge of boats here over the Guadalquiver, which is navigable for large ve&s;&s;els forty miles from its mouth. The compa&s;s of the city walls is eight miles, and the number of its in|habitants is computed at three hundred thou&s;and. It contains a great number of convents, churches, &s;quares, ho&s;pitals, with a mint, which can coin &s;even hundred marks, each containing eight ounces of gold or &s;ilver, in a day; an exchange, which is &s;aid to have co&s;t a million of dollars; a royal palace, now going to decay; a cu&s;tom hou&s;e, to which &s;o many officers belong, that their &s;alaries are &s;aid to amount to fifty-four thou&s;and ducats per annum; an univer&s;ity, founded in the year 1504; and a cathedral, the large&s;t and fine&s;t in all Spain, and, as &s;ome will have it, in the whole world, next to that of St. Peter's at Rome: five hundred ma&s;&s;es are &s;aid every day in it. On the top of the high tower is the &s;tatue of a woman, which turns with the wind like a weather-cock. The archbi&s;hop has an income of one hundred thou&s;and ducats. Here are a great number of &s;ecular and eccle&s;ia&s;tical courts, particularly a court of inqui&s;ition. This city carries on a great trade, and has many manu|factures, particularly of &s;ilk and &s;ilver &s;tuffs, earthen|ware, &s;oap, and &s;alt; but they have declined greatly for twenty or thirty years pa&s;t. All along the river are a great many commodious keys, near which is al&s;o a &s;tately tower, called the Golden Tower, which entirely commands the river, city, and &s;uburbs. The royal court, for the regulation of every thing relating to the We&s;t India trade and company, was removed from hence to Cadiz in the year 1717, which was an irreparable lo&s;s to the city. Near it is a fine wood of olives, full of de|lightful &s;hady walks. It is &s;aid, there are no le&s;s than four thou&s;and officers belonging to the inqui|&s;ition at this place. The adjacent country is very
<PB N="311" REF="3140">
fruitful and plea&s;ant, and particularly noted for fine oranges. The greate&s;t inconvenience to which the city is expo&s;ed, is the overflowing of the river, which &s;ometimes makes dreadful havock. There is a Moori&s;h aqueduct in the neighbourhood worth &s;eeing.</P>
<P>Cadiz, one of the antient and mo&s;t celebrated cities in Spain, well known under the different names of Erythrea, Aphrodi&s;ia, Tarte&s;&s;us, Con|tinu&s;a, Gadir, Gades, and Gadeira, to the Phoe|nicians, Babylonians, Egyptians, Phocians and other Greeks, Carthaginians, and Romans. It is &s;uppo&s;ed to have been built by the Tyrians, as well as the famous temple of Hercules, which an|tiently &s;tood here. It &s;tands on an i&s;land, which is &s;eparated from the continent by a narrow canal or arm of the &s;ea, over which there is a bridge, well fortified, on the Atlantic ocean, being about three hundred miles to the &s;outh-we&s;t of Madrid, eighty from Seville to the &s;outh-we&s;t, and fifty-eight from Gibraltar. The i&s;land is about &s;ixteen or &s;eventeen miles long, and about &s;ix in breadth, producing little grain, but &s;ome good wine and pa&s;ture. The city is fortified after the modern manner, and its &s;pacious harbour and bay are de|fended by &s;everal forts. The number of the in|habitants is computed at forty thou&s;and. It is the &s;ee of a bi&s;hop, who is &s;uffragan to the archbi&s;hop of Seville, and has a revenue of twelve thou&s;and ducats per annum. Many of the hou&s;es are &s;tately, and a few of the &s;treets broad, &s;treight, and well paved. Provi&s;ions and hou&s;e-rent are pretty dear. A great deal of &s;alt is made, and fi&s;h caught about the i&s;land. Among the fi&s;h are tunnies, which are &s;ometimes ten feet in length. This city is the centre of the American commerce, all the goods from Holland, England, Italy, France, and Spain, being &s;hipped off from hence in Spani&s;h bottoms,
<PB N="312" REF="3150">
and under the names of Spani&s;h factors. Were the duties on foreign merchandize &s;ent hither duly paid, the gains of the owners would be far &s;hort of what they now are. There is a prodigious re&s;ort of &s;trangers hither, about the time that the flota u&s;u|ally arrives from America. What are called the pillars of Hercules here, are only two ordinary round towers, which were probably at fir&s;t only windmills. The approach to the i&s;land is dangerous in mo&s;t places, on account of rocks and &s;ands. Near it is another &s;mall i&s;land, now called St. Pe|dro, but antiently Herculeum, from the famous temple of Hercules that &s;tood in it.</P>
<P>Gibraltar, a famed and well known port, at the mouth of the Streights, which take their name from it, about three hundred and twenty miles &s;outh-we&s;t from Madrid; eighty &s;outh from Se|ville; and fifty-eight &s;outh-ea&s;t from Cadiz. It is &s;o well fortified that it is looked upon as impreg|nable, and, &s;ince the treaty of Utrecht, has been in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Engli&s;h, who keep a &s;trong garri&s;on in it, with all the artillery and &s;tores ne|ce&s;&s;ary for its defence. The inhabitants, who are a mixture of Europeans, Jews, Turks, and Moors, carry on a very con&s;iderable trade, and even traffic clande&s;tinely with Spain. The harbour is well fortified. To the we&s;t of it is a bay, on the other &s;ide of which is the famed mount Calpe, directly oppo&s;ite to Ceuta and the hill formerly called Abyla in Africa: the&s;e two hills are ju&s;tly &s;up|po&s;ed to be the true pillars of Hercules. The name of Gibraltar is thought to be a corruption of the Arabic Gebel or Gibel Tarif, i. e. the mount of Tarif, the name of a Moori&s;h general who landed here with auxiliaries from Africa. On the penin&s;ula formed by the above mentioned bay on the we&s;t, and the Mediterranean on the ea&s;t, clo&s;e to Gibralter, and on the &s;ide next Spain, is a

Near this town was fought, in the year 714, the famous battle between the Goths and Moors, which occa&s;ioned the lo&s;s of Spain to the former.

<HEAD>The KINGDOM of GRANADA.</HEAD>
<P>This kingdom, which, as we ob&s;erved before, is &s;ometimes called Upper Andalu&s;ia, is bounded to the &s;outh and ea&s;t by the Mediterranean; to the we&s;t and north by Lower Andalu&s;ia; and to the north-ea&s;t by Murcia. Its extent from we&s;t to ea&s;t is two hundred and ten miles; but its greate&s;t breadth exceeds not eighty. The air here is temperate and healthy, and though there are many mountains in the province, and &s;ome of them very high, yet they are almo&s;t every where co|vered with vines, and fruit-trees, together with laurel, myrtle, &s;weet-ba&s;il, thyme, lavender, marjoram, and other aromatic herbs, which give an exqui&s;ite ta&s;te to the fle&s;h of their &s;heep and cattle. A great deal of &s;ilk and &s;ugar, flax and hemp, honey and wax, is al&s;o produced here, be&s;ides dates and acorns, &s;uperior to the fine&s;t nuts, good &s;tone for building, &s;everal &s;orts of gems, &s;umach, u&s;ed in dre&s;&s;ing goat-&s;kins, and galls, of which a dye is made for leather. The valleys, with which the mountains are inter&s;per&s;ed, are extremely
<PB N="317" REF="3240">
beautiful and fertile. The inhabitants of &s;ome of the highe&s;t mountains are &s;aid to be de&s;cendants of the Moors; and, though they are become Ro|man catholics, retain, in a great mea&s;ure, their an|tient cu&s;toms, manners, and language. The prin|cipal rivers in the province are the Xenil and Gua|dalantin, be&s;ides which there are many le&s;&s;er &s;treams. Abundance of &s;alt is made in this province, which, though neither &s;o populous nor &s;o well cultivated as when &s;ubject to the Moors, yet is as much &s;o as any in Spain. It was the la&s;t of the kingdoms po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed by the Moors, and was not reduced and an|nexed to the crown of Ca&s;tile until 1492. The principal places in it are,</P>
<P>Granada, which gives name to it, and is its ca|pital, &s;tanding at the conflux of the Xenil and Dar|ro, in a whole&s;ome air and fruitful country, an hun|dred and eighty miles &s;outh of Madrid. It is large and magnificent, containing a great number of very hand&s;ome public and private buildings. Its walls, which are adorned with many towers at equal di&s;tances, are &s;aid to be ten miles in compa&s;s. Here are two ca&s;tles; the one built by the Moors, and the other by Charles V. and Philip II. They both command a very fine pro&s;pect; and the fir&s;t is &s;o large, that it looks like a city by it|&s;elf, and, it is &s;aid, has room enough to accommo|date forty thou&s;and people, exclu&s;ive of the royal palace, and the convent of St. Francis.

The city is encompa&s;&s;ed with a double wall, and defended by two ca&s;tles. So great is the exportation of wines, rai&s;ins, almonds, figs, le|mons, oranges, and other fruits, from hence, be|&s;ides wool and oil, that the duties on them are &s;aid to yield to the king eight hundred thou&s;and ducats per annum. The harbour runs up into the town five hundred and thirty common paces, with a good breadth, and four &s;tairs to take water at, and twenty four pillars of ja&s;per &s;tone to fa&s;ten the &s;hips to. The city is &s;uppo&s;ed to have been founded by the Phoenicians. The bi&s;hop is &s;ubject to the arch|bi&s;hop of Seville, and has a revenue of twenty thou|&s;and ducats per annum.</P>

<HEAD>The KINGDOM of MURCIA.</HEAD>
<P>This kingdom takes its name from the capi|tal, and was antiently a part of the Tarraconen|&s;is, inhabited chiefly by the Conte&s;tani and the Ba&s;titani, and containing the Campus Spartarius, &s;ituated on the Sinus Illiritanus, now the gulph of Carthage. It was not entirely recovered from the Moors till the year 1266. It borders to the north on New-Ca&s;tile, by which and Andalu&s;ia it is al&s;o bounded to the we&s;t; to the north-ea&s;t it has Va|lentia; to the &s;outh the Mediterranean &s;ea; and to the &s;outh-we&s;t Granada. Its greate&s;t length from north to &s;outh is about an hundred miles, and its breadth about ninety. Though moun|tainous, it produces &s;ome corn, and great quanti|ties of fine fruits, particularly oranges and lemons,
<PB N="320" REF="3270">
together with honey, &s;ilk, &s;ugar, rice, peas, oil, and pa&s;ture. The air, though &s;omewhat of the hot|te&s;t, is pure and healthy. The principal river is the Sigura, antiently called Terebus, Straberum, and Sorabis; and the places of mo&s;t note are,</P>
<P>Murcia, from which the province takes its name, &s;ituated in a &s;pacious and delightful plain, on the river Segura, about two hundred miles &s;outh-ea&s;t from Madrid, and about twenty north from Car|thagena. This city is large and populous, having a great many convents, churches, &s;quares, and gates, with a good wall, a court of inqui&s;ition, a &s;tately palace, and a ca&s;tle. The adjacent country abounds in mulberry trees, olives, &s;ugar-canes, and fine fruits. The city hath often &s;uffered by the inundations of the Segura.</P>
<P>Carthagena, a noted &s;ea-port on the Mediterra|nean, at the mouth of the river Guadalantin, not far from Cape Palos, an hundred and eighty miles &s;outh-&s;outh-ea&s;t from Madrid, and forty-two &s;outh|we&s;t from Murcia. It is &s;aid to have been built by A&s;drubal, the Carthaginian general, 225 years before Chri&s;t, and called Carthago-Nova or New-Carthage. The air here is temperate in &s;ummer; and &s;o mild in winter, that the ro&s;es blow as fair and fre&s;h at Chri&s;tmas, as in England at June. Under the Romans and Carthaginians, this was one of the mo&s;t flouri&s;hing cities in all Spain; for, from hence they &s;hipped off tho&s;e va&s;t quantities of gold and &s;ilver, which they dug in the Pyrenees, and other mountains. Both city and harbour are well fortified. The bay on which it &s;tands a|bounds in fi&s;h, e&s;pecially mackarel; and the neigh|bouring country affords diamonds, rubies, ame|thy&s;ts, garnets, agates, and mines of alum. The city is pretty large, and its harbour one of the be&s;t in Spain. The bi&s;hop is &s;uffragan to the archbi|&s;hop

<HEAD>Of the ISLANDS on the COAST of SPAIN.</HEAD>
<P>The principal of the&s;e are Majorca, Minorca, Ivica, Fermentora, and Cabrora, in the Mediterra|nean. The two fir&s;t were antiently called Baleares and Balearides, i. e. the I&s;lands of the Slingers, the inhabitants being then expert &s;lingers, as the Mi|norcans are at pre&s;ent. The Greeks called them al&s;o gymna&s;ia, on account of the inhabitants going naked. The&s;e, with the other le&s;&s;er i&s;les about them, compo&s;ed once a kingdom, called the king|dom of Majorca, which was by degrees recovered from the Moors, and annexed to the kingdom of Ar|ragon. They all now belong to the crown of Spain, except Minorca, which is held by the Engli&s;h.</P>
<P>Malorca, or, as we pronounce it, Majorca, is the large&s;t, being about &s;ixty miles in length, and forty in breadth, and the neare&s;t to the Spani&s;h coa&s;t, being only about an hundred miles from Barcelona. It abounds in corn. wine, oil, honey, &s;affron, large and &s;mall cattle, fi&s;h, rabbits, deer, hor&s;es, and wild fowl, e&s;pecially partridges; but there are no wild bea&s;ts in it. There are four capes in the i&s;land, viz. Pedra on the ea&s;t &s;ide, Gro&s;|&s;er on the we&s;t, Salinas on the &s;outh, and Fer|mentor on the north. There are watch-towers all round it; and towards the north and we&s;t it is
<PB N="322" REF="3290">
mountainous, but has &s;everal good harbours, with plenty of water. The air is whole&s;ome, but very hot and dry in &s;ummer. A con&s;iderable body of hor&s;e and foot is kept here for the defence of the i&s;land. The language of the better &s;ort is Spani&s;h; but that of the common people is a med|ley of Spani&s;h, Latin, Greek, and Arabic. The principal place in it is that from which it takes its name, viz.</P>
<P>Majorca, antiently Palma, which &s;tands on the &s;outh-we&s;t &s;ide of the i&s;land, on a bay betwixt two capes, and is a large and well fortified town, the re&s;idence of the viceroy, the &s;eat of a court of inqui&s;ition and other courts, and al&s;o of a bi&s;hop, who is &s;uffragan to the archbi&s;hop of Valentia, and has a revenue of twenty thou&s;and ducats per annum. Here likewi&s;e is an univer&s;ity, a &s;tately cathedral, a great many churches, &s;eve|ral ho&s;pitals, hand&s;ome &s;treets, and &s;quares. Of the la&s;t there is one called Born, where the bull|fights and other &s;hews are exhibited. The in|habitants are computed at ten thou&s;and. The other places worth mentioning are,</P>
<P>Calobra, Porto Pedro, and Paguira, fine har|bours; Cividad Alcudia, a con&s;iderable town; and Pollen&ccedil;a, having a good harbour, and noted for an excellent wine called montona.</P>
<P>Minorca lies thirty-three miles ea&s;t-north-ea&s;t of Majorca. Its greate&s;t length from ea&s;t to we&s;t is thirty-eight miles, and its breadth fifteen. The air is moi&s;t, but never exce&s;&s;ive cold or hot. Here are lead-mines, plenty of fi&s;h, &s;alt, fine marble, rabbits, &s;heep, honey, wax, capers, oil, cotton, wine, &s;ome of which is excellent, fine acorns, opuntia, palm-trees, which however bear no fruit, myrtles, with a va&s;t variety of petrified

&s;hells, and a great deal of cattle. The water is &s;aid to be none of the be&s;t. The inhabitants, like the Spaniards, are too proud and lazy to cultivate the ground in a proper manner, and con&s;equently have but little corn. They are com|puted at about twenty-&s;even thou&s;and, have a natural turn to poetry, love mu&s;ic and dancing, and, like their ance&s;tors, are expert &s;lingers. In 1756, the French got po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of this i&s;land; the Engli&s;h garri&s;on in Fort St. Philip's not having been duly &s;upplied, reinforced, and &s;upported, through the cowardice or treachery of admiral Byng, who was &s;ent to its relief. The only places in the i&s;land worth mentioning are,</P>
<P>Citadella, the capital, lying on the we&s;t coa&s;t, where the governor re&s;ides. It is a &s;mall place, but well fortified, and chiefly inhabited by the Engli&s;h.</P>
<P>Port Mahon, one of the fine&s;t harbours in Eu|rope, (both for its capaciou&s;ne&s;s, and &s;ecurity from wind and enemies) being four miles long, and above half a mile in breadth. The town is &s;mall, but has a bri&s;k trade. Near it is St. Philip's ca&s;tle, a &s;quare fort of four ba&s;tions, which has always a good garri&s;on. This fort, with the town and har|bour, lie at the &s;outh-ea&s;t end of the i&s;land.</P>
<P>The French were obliged to re&s;tore the i&s;land to the Engli&s;h at the conclu&s;ion of the war.</P>
<P>The i&s;lands of Ivica and Fermentora were called Pythyu&s;ae by the Greeks, from the va&s;t quantities of pines they produced. The former &s;eparately was called Ebu&s;us, and the other Ophiu&s;a and Col|lubraria. They lie about thirty-&s;ix miles we&s;t of Cape St. Martin, on the coa&s;t of Spain. The for|mer is about forty miles long, and twenty-two broad, and very mountainous, but not unfruit|ful,

where it is cultivated. Its principal commo|dities are dried figs and &s;alt. It is &s;aid, no veno|mous creature will live in it. The principal place is Ivica, antiently Ebu&s;us, whence the i&s;land takes its name, a &s;mall town, but the re&s;idence of the governor, who is &s;ubordinate to the viceroy of Majorca; and it has a fort and harbour, being &s;ituated on the &s;outh coa&s;t of the i&s;land. Fermen|tora, the other Pythyu&s;a, lies about &s;ix miles &s;outh of Ivica. It is &s;mall, and at pre&s;ent uninhabited. Cabrera, the la&s;t of the&s;e i&s;lands we mentioned, had its name from the multitude of goats found in it.

<HEAD>NAME, EXTENT, and BOUNDARIES.</HEAD>
<P>THE antient names of this country were He&s;|peria, Saturnia, Au&s;onia, Oenotria, Cani|cula, and Latium; but the&s;e were at fir&s;t appro|priated to particular di&s;tricts. The pre&s;ent name is by &s;ome derived from Italus, an antient king of Scicily, who came with a colony, and &s;ettled in this country. Others derive it from the Greek word Italos, &s;ignifying an ox, becau&s;e it formerly bred tho&s;e animals in great numbers, and of an ex|traordinary &s;ize; but the mo&s;t probable derivation is from Etolia, a country of Greece, which lies oppo&s;ite to this, Etolia and Italia differing little in the &s;ound. The Germans call it Wal&s;chland, which, though it &s;ignifies literally theland or country of &s;trangers, or foreigners, is now re&s;trained to Italy. The &s;outh part of Italy, or the kingdom of Naples, was
<PB N="326" REF="3330">
antiently called Magna Grecia. Italy lies between the 7th and 10th degrees of ea&s;t longitude, and be|tween the 37th and 46th degrees of north latitude. On the north, north-we&s;t, and north-ea&s;t, it is bounded by France, Switzerland, the country of the Gri&s;ons, and Germany; on the ea&s;t by the Adriatic, or Gulph of Venice; and on the &s;outh and we&s;t by the Mediterranean; its figure being not unlike that of a boot. Its length from Ao&s;ta, at the foot of the Alps in Savoy, to the utmo&s;t verge of Calabria, is computed at about &s;ix hundred miles; but its breadth is very unequal, being in &s;ome places near four hundred miles, but &s;o nar|row in others, as not to exceed twenty-five or thirty miles.</P>

<HEAD>REVOLUTIONS and MEMORABLE EVENTS.</HEAD>
<P>With re&s;pect to its original inhabitants, the mo&s;t probable conjecture is, that the po&s;terity of Gomer, the &s;on of Japhet, and grand&s;on of Noah, came &s;oon after the di&s;per&s;ion into Europe, and peopled the greater part of it, e&s;pecially the &s;outhern coun|tries, namely, Greece, Gaul, Italy, and Spain. The nations, which in antient authors are &s;aid to have made the fir&s;t &s;ettlements in Italy, were the Umbri, the Au&s;ones, the Opici, the O&s;ci, the Siculi, the Tu&s;ci, the Ligures, and the Veneti; afterwards the Celtes of Gaul, and the Greeks, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed them|&s;elves of a great part of the country. In tho&s;e early ages, when the Romans fir&s;t began to ex|tend their territories, Italy, like mo&s;t other coun|tries, was parcelled out into a great number of &s;mall &s;tates, who were all gradually &s;ubdued by the Romans. Upon the declen&s;ion of the Roman empire, the Huns, Goths, Vandals, Heruli, and other northern nations, pa&s;&s;ed the Alps, and &s;eized on the greate&s;t part of it. After them came the Lom|bards,
<PB N="327" REF="3340">
or Longbeards, and erected a kingdom in the northern part of it, which was overturned by Charlemagne, who founded a new empire in the we&s;t. Of the hi&s;tory of Italy &s;ince that period little need be &s;aid, &s;ince it is generally well known. The empe|rors, re&s;iding in Germany, divided Italy into &s;everal governments, the governors whereof at length a&s;|&s;umed &s;overeign power, the popes inciting, aiding, and &s;upporting them, in order to weaken the em|perors, and thereby to increa&s;e their own power, and render them&s;elves independent. Thus a great many &s;mall principalities and &s;tates were erected, which, however, &s;till profe&s;&s;ed to acknowlege the emperor their head; and many of them procured grants from the emperors, to confirm their re&s;pective titles, which they generally purcha&s;ed with &s;ums of money. The popes too, for a con&s;iderable time, acknowleged that they held their territories of the emperor; but at la&s;t, impatient of all appearance of &s;ubjection and dependence, by exciting in&s;urrections, embroiling the emperors affairs in Germany and Italy, and other indirect unwarrantable me|thods, they not only rendered them&s;elves indepen|dent, but a&s;&s;umed an authority to judge of their actions, as well as tho&s;e of other princes; and, in con&s;equence of that, to ab&s;olve their &s;ubjects from their allegiance, and transfer their dominions to others.</P>

<P>The principal mountains in Italy are the Alps and Apennines. The former extend from the river Var, near Nice, to the Adriatic. Some branches of them are called the Maritime, others the Cot|tian, others the Greek, others the Rhetian, others the Peninian, and others the Noric and Carnician Alps. The Apennines run the whole length of

Italy from the north-we&s;t to the &s;outh-ea&s;t. The rivers of mo&s;t note are the Po, in Latin, Padus, which ri&s;es in Piedmont, and falls into the Adri|atic; the Adige, in Latin, Athe&s;is, which ri&s;es in Tyrol, and falls into the Adriatic; the Arno, which ri&s;es in the Apennines, and falls into the Tu&s;can &s;ea near Pi&s;a; the Tyber, which has its &s;ource in the Apennines, pa&s;&s;es by Rome, and falls into the Tu&s;can &s;ea at O&s;tia. The &s;maller rivers are the Adda, the Te&s;ino, the Oglio, the Mincio, the Tanaro, the Trebia, the Carigliano, antiently Liris, the Voltorno, the Brenta, and &s;everal others &s;till le&s;s.

<HEAD>AIR, SOIL, and PRODUCE.</HEAD>
<P>The air of Italy is very different, according to the different &s;ituations of the &s;everal countries con|tained in it. In tho&s;e on the north of the Apen|nines it is more temperate, but in tho&s;e on the &s;outh generally very warm. The air of the Campania of Rome, and of the Ferrare&s;e, is &s;aid to be un|healthful, which is owing to the lands not being duly cultivated, nor the mar&s;hes drained. That of the other parts is generally pure, dry, and healthy. In &s;ummer the heat is very great in the kingdom of Naples, and would be almo&s;t intole|rable, if it was not &s;omewhat alleviated by the &s;ea|breezes. The &s;oil of Italy in general is very fer|tile, being watered by a great number of rivers. It produces a great variety of wines, and the be&s;t oil in Europe, excellent &s;ilk in abundance, corn of all &s;orts, but not in &s;uch plenty as in &s;ome other countries, oranges, lemons, citrons, pomegranates, almonds, rai&s;ins, &s;ugar, mulberry-trees without number, figs, peaches, nectarines, apricots, pears,

apples, filberts, che&s;nuts, &amp;c. Mo&s;t of the&s;e fruits were at fir&s;t imported by the Romans from A&s;ia Minor, Greece, Africa, and Syria, and were not the natural products of the &s;oil. The tender plants are covered in winter on the north-&s;ide of the Apennines, but on the &s;outh-&s;ide they have no need of it. This country al&s;o yields good pa&s;ture, and abounds with cattle, &s;heep, goats, buffaloes, wild boars, mules, and hor&s;es. The fore&s;ts are well &s;tored with game, and the mountains yield not only mines of iron, lead, alum, &s;ulphur, mar|ble of all &s;orts, alaba&s;ter, ja&s;per, porphyry, &amp;c. but al&s;o gold and &s;ilver, with a great variety of a|romatic herbs, trees, &s;hrubs, and ever-greens, as thyme, lavender, laurel, and bays, wild olive-trees, tamarinds, juniper, oaks, and pines. Italy, tho' a country &s;o rich and beautiful, that it is &s;tiled the garden of Europe, is, however, not without many and great inconveniences, which we &s;hall take no|tice of in the more particular de&s;cription of it.</P>

<HEAD>LANGUAGE and RELIGION.</HEAD>
<P>With re&s;pect to the Italian language, it is the old Latin, blended and corrupted with the jargons of the northern nations that over-ran this country, af|ter the declen&s;ion of the Roman empire; but hath been &s;o poli&s;hed, refined, and improved &s;ince, that it is now e&s;teemed very elegant, &s;oft, &s;mooth, and harmonious, and con&s;equently very fit for mu&s;ic and poetry. In proportion, however, to the &s;moothne&s;s it hath acquired, it hath lo&s;t its &s;trength, force, and energy. It is &s;aid to be &s;poken in the greate&s;t purity in Tu&s;cany. The predominant re|ligion is the Roman catholic: no prote&s;tant &s;ect is tolerated, excepting at Leghorn; but Greeks and Jews are found in &s;everal places. At Leghorn, Jews, Greeks, and Mahometans, have an entire liberty,
<PB N="330" REF="3370">
and the Engli&s;h factory have a chapel. There is no country in Europe, of the &s;ame extent, where there is &s;uch a number of archbi&s;hoprics, bi&s;hoprics, univer&s;ities, and abbies, as in this. The power of the pope, however, and of the prie&s;ts, is daily lo&s;ing ground, even in this country, the &s;eat of that &s;piritual empire, upon which the Roman catholic &s;tates are making continual encroachments, rapidly re&s;uming tho&s;e rights and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, of which prie&s;t-craft, and the blind zeal and &s;uper&s;tition of former ages, had deprived them.</P>

<HEAD>TRADE and MANUFACTURES.</HEAD>
<P>A very exten&s;ive trade is carried on in many places in Italy, particularly at Leghorn, Genoa, Bologna, Venice, and Naples; the country having a great variety of commodities and manufactures for exportation, e&s;pecially wine, oil, perfumes, fruits, and &s;ilks. Travellers al&s;o bring large &s;ums of money into Italy, be&s;ides what they lay out in pictures, curio&s;ities, relics, antiquities, &amp;c.</P>

<HEAD>PERSONS, CHARACTER, DRESS, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>With re&s;pect to the per&s;ons of the Italians, they are generally well proportioned, though their com|plexions are none of the be&s;t. As to dre&s;s, they gene|rally follow the fa&s;hions of the countries on which they border, or to which they are &s;ubject, namely, tho&s;e of France, Spain, and Germany. With re&s;pect to their genius and ta&s;te in architecture, paint|ing, carving, and mu&s;ic, they are thought to excel greatly, and to leave the other nations of Europe far behind them; but their mu&s;ic &s;eems too &s;oft and effeminate to de&s;erve all the prai&s;e be&s;towed on it; and their hou&s;es are far inferior to tho&s;e of Eng|land, in re&s;pect of convenience. No country
<PB N="331" REF="3380">
hath produced better politicians, hi&s;torians, poets, painters, and &s;culptors, we mean &s;ince the revival of the arts and &s;ciences, exclu&s;ive of tho&s;e of an|tient times. The Italians are very affable, courte|ous, ingenious, &s;ober, and ready witted; but ex|tremely jealous, vindictive, la&s;civious, ceremoni|ous, and &s;uper&s;titious. In re&s;pect to jealou&s;y, in|deed, we are told, that a very extraordinary change hath lately taken place; and that the Italians are now no le&s;s indulgent and complai&s;ant to their wives, than the mo&s;t polite hu&s;bands in France it&s;elf. In their tempers, the Italians &s;eem to be a good medium between the French and Spa|niards, neither &s;o gay and volatile as the one, nor &s;o grave and &s;olemn as the other. Boiled &s;nails, &s;erved up with oil and pepper, or fried in oil, and the hinder parts of frogs, are reckoned dainty di&s;hes. Kites, jackdaws, hawks, and magpies, are al&s;o eaten, not only by the common people, but the better &s;ort. Wine is drank here both in &s;ummer and winter cool|ed by ice or &s;now. The women affect yellow hair, as the Roman ladies and courte&s;ans formerly did. They al&s;o u&s;e paint and wa&s;hes, both for their hands and faces. The day here is reckoned from &s;un-&s;et to &s;un-&s;et, as the Athenians did of old.</P>
<P>Having &s;aid thus much of Italy in general, we &s;hall now proceed to give an account of the &s;everal &s;tates into which it is divided, beginning with tho&s;e of the king of Sardinia on the north, after we have premi&s;ed a few remarks in regard to his power, forces, revenues, &amp;c.</P>
<P>The kings of Sardinia are &s;aid to be de&s;cended from Figuardo, who was king of Saxony about the middle of the &s;eventh century. Until the year 1713, they were only dukes of Savoy; but then Victor Amadeus II. a&s;&s;umed the title of king of
<PB N="332" REF="3390">
Sicily, which he had obtained at the peace made that year. In the year 1718, however, he was obliged to accept of Sardinia in lieu of Sicily; upon which he took the title of king of Sardinia.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t of this family, who took the title of duke of Savoy, was Amadeus VIII. in the year 1397. The king of Sardina is now ranked among the greate&s;t princes of Italy: he is ab&s;olute in tempo|rals, and has as much power, as any catholic prince what&s;oever, in &s;pirituals; for all eccle&s;ia&s;ti|cal preferments are at his di&s;po&s;al, and the inqui|&s;ition at Turin can lay no one under arre&s;t, with|out fir&s;t acquainting the council. All civil cau&s;es al&s;o, even &s;uch wherein eccle&s;ia&s;tics are plaintiffs or defendants, are tried before the temporal judges. Mr. Key&s;ler &s;ays, it would be difficult to find a place where arbitrary power is carried to a greater height than at Turin. The king, as a member of the Germanic body, has a &s;eat in their diets, among the princes of the circle of the Upper Rhine, and contributes his quota to the general taxes of the empire; but he is not &s;ubject to its laws and con&s;titutions; only he receives the in|ve&s;titure of &s;uch territories as he enjoys in the Montferrat and Milane&s;e from the emperor. The principal colleges or boards at Turin, are the privy|council, the council of Sardinia, and the council of &s;tate.</P>
<P>As to the royal revenue, nothing certain can be affirmed, only it is &s;aid to exceed that of his Britannic maje&s;ty, as elector of Brun&s;wick Lune|burg. Some, indeed, have computed it at five hundred thou&s;and pound &s;terling per annum; but, without doubt, it greatly exceeds that &s;um now. That of Sardinia, however, in particular, is hardly equal, it is &s;aid, to the charges of the government. The chief branches of the revenue are the crown|lands, the duties on &s;ilk, rice, hemp, and cards.</P>
<P><PB N="333" REF="3400">
The taxes, in general, are &s;aid to be &s;crewed up to the highe&s;t pitch, and levied with the mo&s;t inflexible &s;everity; and as the king's power is greater and more unlimited in civil affairs, than that of any mo|narch in Europe, and as great in eccle&s;ia&s;tical, as that of any other of the Roman catholic powers, he may augment or dimini&s;h them ju&s;t as he plea&s;es.</P>
<P>With regard to the king's forces, they amount commonly, in time of peace, to about fifteen thou|&s;and men, be&s;ides the militia, hor&s;e-guards, and the train of artillery. There are &s;everal regiments of foreigners, e&s;pecially Germans, in his &s;ervice; and many of his towns are &s;trongly fortified and gari&s;oned.</P>
<P>The principal order of knighthood in this prince's dominions, is that of the Annunciada, which was in&s;tituted by Amadeus VI. in 1562. The knights wear a gold collar, on each link of which are engraved the&s;e letters, F. E. R. T. which &s;ome read, Fortitudo ejus Rhodum tenuit; al|ledging, that they allude to Amadeus V's. re|lieving the i&s;land of Rhodes, then be&s;ieged by the Turks; but they were part of the arms of Savoy long before that event. The number of knights are fourteen, be&s;ides the duke, who is &s;overeign of the order. They have all the title of excel|lency. The only other order is that of St. Mau|rice. Every knight of the Annunciada mu&s;t pre|viou&s;ly be of this order, and ranks according to the date of his admi&s;&s;ion into it.</P>
<P>The king of Sardinia's dominions on the conti|nent, con&s;i&s;t of the duchy of Savoy, the principality of Piedmont, the duchy of Montferrat, and a part of the duchy of Milan, of which in order.</P>

<HEAD>The DUCHY of SAVOY.</HEAD>
<P>The name of Savoy is derived from the Latin Sabaadia, altered afterwards to Saboia, and Sa|bojia.</P>
<P>This country was antiently inhabited by the Celtes, who&s;e de&s;cendants therein were &s;ubdivided into the Allobroges, Nantuates, Veragri, Seduni, Sala&s;&s;i, Centrones, Garocelli, and &s;ome others of inferior note. Of all the&s;e the Allobroges were the mo&s;t con&s;iderable. The reduction of the&s;e tribes, in which Julius Cae&s;ar had made a great progre&s;s, was compleated under Augu&s;tus. Af|terwards this country &s;hared the fate of the re&s;t of the we&s;tern empire, and was over-run by the northern Barbarians. The Burgundians held it a con&s;iderable time: but when, or how it fir&s;t became a di&s;tinct earldom under the pre&s;ent family, is what hi&s;torians are not agreed about; thus much however is certain, that Amadaeus I. who lived in the twelfth century, was count of it. In 1416, Ama|daeus VIII. was created, by the emperor Sigi&s;mund, duke of Savoy, and Victor Amadaeus II. as we ob&s;erved above, fir&s;t took the tittle of king of Sicily, and afterwards of Sardinia. The pre&s;ent king is Charles Emanuel III. who is far advanced in years: the heir-apparent to the crown has the title of duke of Savoy, and prince of Piedmont. Savoy is bounded to the &s;outh by France and Piedmont; to the north by the lake of Geneva, which &s;eparates it from Switzerland; to the we&s;t by France; and to the ea&s;t by Piedmont, the Milane&s;e, and Switzerland: its greate&s;t length being about eighty-eight miles, and breadth a|bout &s;eventy-&s;ix.</P>
<P>As it lies among the Alps, it is full of lofty mountains, which in general are very barren:
<PB N="335" REF="3420">
many of the highe&s;t of them are perpetually co|vered with ice and &s;now. The &s;ummit of tho&s;e, called Montagnes-Maudites, the cur&s;ed moun|tains, are &s;aid to be more than two Engli&s;h miles in perpendicular height above the level of the lake of Geneva, and that level it&s;elf is much higher than the Mediterranean. In &s;ome few of the vallies there is corn-land and pa&s;ture, and a good breed of cattle and mules, and along the lake of Geneva, and in two or three other places, a tolerable wine is produced. Mount Senis or Cenis, between Sa|voy and Piedmont, over which the high-way from Geneva to Turin lies, is as high, if not higher, than the Mantagnes-Maudites; but of all the moun|tains of the Alps, the highe&s;t is mount Roche|melon, in Piedmont, between Fertiere and No|vale&s;e. The roads over the&s;e mountains are very tedious, di&s;agreeable, and dangerous, e&s;pecially as huge ma&s;&s;es of &s;now, called by the Italians ava|lanches, and fragments of rocks, frequently roll down into them from the impending precipices. The way of travelling is either in &s;ledges, chairs, or on the backs of mules: in &s;ome places the path on the brink of the precepices is &s;o narrow, that there is but ju&s;t room for a &s;ingle per&s;on to pa&s;s. It be|gins to &s;now on the&s;e mountains commonly about the beginning of October. In &s;ummer, in the months of July, Augu&s;t, and September, many of them yield very fine gra&s;s, with a great variety of flowers and herbs; and others box-wood, walnuts, che&s;nuts, and pines. The height and different combinations of the&s;e mountains, their towering &s;ummits ri&s;ing above one another, and covered with &s;now, the many cataracts, or falls of water, the noi&s;e and rapidity of the river Arc, the froth and green tincture of its water, the echoes, the numerous &s;treams tumbling from cliff to cliff, form altogether a very romantic &s;cene. The&s;e
<PB N="336" REF="3430">
mountainous tracts, notwith&s;tanding their height, are not altogether free from thunder in &s;ummer, and are al&s;o much expo&s;ed to thick clouds, which &s;ometimes &s;ettle unexpectedly on them, and con|tinue &s;everal days. There are &s;ome wolves among the thickets, and they abound with hares, rupi|capras, or chamois, and marmottes: the la&s;t of the&s;e, called in Latin muresalpini, burrow under ground, and &s;leep eight or nine months in the year, five, &s;ix, and &s;ometimes more, in one burrow. In the lower parts of Savoy, there are al&s;o bears, wild-boars, deer, and rabbits; and among the de&s;olate moun|tains are found great quantities of rock-cry&s;tal. In the glacieres or ice-vallies, between the high mountains, the air is extremely cold, even in the months of July and Augu&s;t. The &s;urface of the&s;e ice-valleys looks like a &s;ea or lake, which after having been agitated by fierce and contiary winds, has been frozen all at once, inter&s;per&s;ed with hide|ous cracks and cha&s;ms. The noi&s;e of the&s;e cracks, when fir&s;t made by the heat of the noon-day &s;un, and reverberated by the &s;urrounding rocks and mountains, is a&s;toni&s;hing. The height of the impending mountains is &s;uch, that the &s;un's rays &s;eldom reach the ice-vallies, except a few hours in the middle of &s;ummer. The avalanches, or &s;now|balls, which the lea&s;t concu&s;&s;ion of the air will occa&s;ion, tumble down the mountains with amaz|ing rapidity, continually increa&s;ing, and carrying all before them. People have been taken out alive, after being buried &s;everal days under them.</P>
<P>The chief rivers are the Rhone, which, on the &s;ide of Geneva, &s;eparates Savoy from France; the Arve, which has &s;ome particles of gold in its &s;ands; the I&s;ere, the Seran, the Siers, and the Arc. There are al&s;o a great many lakes in this country, which yield plenty of fi&s;h, but none of them are very large, together with medicinal and reciprocating &s;prings, and hot baths.</P>
<P><PB N="337" REF="3440">
The language of the common people is a cor|rupt French; but the better &s;ort, and tho&s;e that live in the great cities, &s;peak as good French as they do in Paris it&s;elf.</P>
<P>In their temper, however, and di&s;po&s;ition, the Savoyards re&s;emble the Germans more than the French, retaining &s;till much of the old German hone&s;ty, and &s;implicity of manners, which, no doubt, is partly owing to the poverty and barren|ne&s;s of the country. To this al&s;o, joined to their longevity, and the fruitfulne&s;s of their women, which are the effects of their cheerful di&s;po&s;ition, healthy air, activity, temperance, and &s;obriety, it is owing, that great numbers of them are obliged to go abroad in que&s;t of a livelihood, which they earn, tho&s;e at lea&s;t, who have no trades, by &s;hew|ing marmottes, cleaning &s;hoes, &s;weeping chim|nies, and the like. It is &s;aid, that there are ge|nerally about eighteen thou&s;and of them, young and old, about Paris. In &s;ummer they lie in the &s;treets, and in winter forty, fifty, or &s;ixty of them lodge together in a room: they are &s;o ho|ne&s;t, that they may be tru&s;ted to any amount. The children are often carried abroad in ba&s;|kets, before they are able to walk. In many vil|lages in Savoy there is hardly a man to be &s;een throughout the year, excepting a month or two. Tho&s;e that have families generally &s;et out and re|turn about the &s;ame &s;ea&s;on, when their wives com|monly lie-in, and they never fail to bring home &s;ome part of their &s;mall earnings. Some of them are &s;uch con&s;ummate ma&s;ters of oeconomy, that they &s;et up &s;hops, and make fortunes, and others return home with a competency for the re&s;t of their days. An old man is often di&s;patched with letters, little pre&s;ents, and &s;ome money, from the younger &s;ort, to their parents and relations, and brings back with him fre&s;h colonies, letters, me&s;|&s;ages,
<PB N="338" REF="3450">
and news. The cultivation of their grounds, and the reaping and gathering in of the harve&s;t and vintage, are generally left to the women and chil|dren; but all this is to be under&s;tood of the moun|tainous parts of Savoy. Great numbers of the mountaineers of both &s;exes are &s;aid to be lame and deformed, and they are much &s;ubject to a kind of wens, which grow about their throats, and very much disfigure them, e&s;pecially the women; but that is the only inconvenience they feel from them.</P>
<P>The nobility of Savoy, and the other dominions of the kng of Sardinia labour under great hard|&s;harps and re&s;trictions, unheard of in other coun|tries, which we have not room here to particu|larize. A minute account of them will be found in Mr. Key&s;ler's Travels. In &s;hort, the king has left neither liberty power, nor much property, to any but him&s;elf, and the clergy, who&s;e overgrown wealth he has al&s;o greatly curtailed.</P>
<P>No other religion is profe&s;&s;ed or tolerated in Savoy, but that of the church of Rome. The decrees, however, of the council of Trent are not admitted; nor are the churches a&s;ylums for malefactors.</P>
<P>This duchy is divided into tho&s;e of Chablais, Genevois, and Savoy proper, the counties of Ta|rantai&s;e and Maurienne, and the barony of Faucigny, and contains the following places of note.</P>

As to the epithet of Gratianae, it had that from the emperor Gratian, who rebuilt and beautified it. The hot baths here are free to all, paying only the attendant or rub|ber a trifle: the water of them is clear, and of a greeni&s;h colour: no fi&s;h or any animal will live in them.

<HEAD>The PRINCIPALITY of PIEDMONT.</HEAD>
<P>Piedmont is a part of the antient Lombardy, and owes its pre&s;ent name to its &s;ituation at the foot of
<PB N="341" REF="3480">
the Alps. By the Romans it was called Gallia Ci&s;al|pina, to di&s;tingui&s;h it from Gallia Tran&s;alpina. It is bounded to the &s;outh by the Mediterranean, and the territory of Genoa; to the north by the duchy of Ao&s;|ta, and a part of the Milane&s;e; to the ea&s;t by the duchies of Montferrat and Milan; and to the we&s;t by France; extending from &s;outh to north about an hundred and fifty miles, and from ea&s;t to we&s;t, where broade&s;t, about ninety-four. The river Po divides it into two parts; of which that next Rome was antiently called Gallia Ci&s;padana, and the other Tran&s;padana. It is a very fruitful country, e&s;pe|cially the lower parts of it, yielding plenty of corn and wine, and a great variety of fruits, particu|larly filberts and che&s;nuts. Here are al&s;o great numbers of mulberry trees, with hemp, flax, &s;af|fron, truffles, good &s;tore of cattle, and &s;ome me|tals. The fine&s;t &s;pot in the king's dominions is that between Turin and Coni, which, it is &s;aid, can hardly be equalled any where, and no where exceeded. Many of the country people of Pied|mont earn betwixt &s;ixty and &s;eventy dollars a-year, by digging only for truffles. The breeding and fattening of cattle turn to great account here; the profits annually ari&s;ing therefrom being &s;aid to amount to near three millions of livres per annum. The Piedmonte&s;e &s;ilk is reckoned the fine&s;t and &s;tronge&s;t in Italy; the cultivation of it mu&s;t there|fore be a very profitable article to the inhabitants. The fine &s;ells for about a louis d'or per pound, and the coar&s;er, not wound off the cocoons, for about twenty or twenty five &s;ols. Of the moun|tains in Piedmont, the highe&s;t are Rochemelon, mentioned before, and Vi&s;o. It takes a whole day to go to the top of the former, whence, in clear weather, there is a mo&s;t exten&s;ive pro&s;pect. Every year, on the fifth of Augu&s;t, a va&s;t crowd of peo|ple a&s;&s;emble on the top of it, where there is a &s;ta|tue

The report of a mu&s;ket fired on it is no louder than that produced by the breaking of a &s;tick. Hannibal is &s;uppo&s;ed to have marched over the other mountain, in his way to Italy. The other rivers in Piedmont, be&s;ides the Po, mentioned a|bove, are the Se&s;ia, Tenaro, and Doria Baltea, which fall into the Po; and the Var, which falls into the Mediterranean. The language of the country is a mixture of French and Italian: but many of the better &s;ort &s;peak both the&s;e languages equally well. With re&s;pect to the character of the Piedmonte&s;e, they are &s;aid to be very lively, &s;hrewd, and artful, and very capable of di&s;tin|gui&s;hing them&s;elves in the &s;ciences, if their genius had full &s;cope given it; but no heretical books, as they are called, that is, &s;uch as might open their eyes to &s;ee the pious frauds of the prie&s;ts, are allowed to be brought into the coun|try: however, neither Je&s;uits, nor any other regu|lars, are &s;uffered to keep &s;chools publicly. Some villages bordering on Dauphin&eacute; are inhabited by the Walden&s;es, who&s;e tenets, in many points, differ|ing from tho&s;e of the church of Rome: have of|ten expo&s;ed them to the fury and per&s;ecution of the bigotted papi&s;ts.

an enchanting pro&s;pect, takes about an hour and an half. That it is very &s;trong is evident from the long &s;iege which it &s;u&s;tained in the beginning of this cen|tury; and, no doubt, the fortifications are greatly improved &s;ince. Within the city are forty-eight churches and convents, and &s;ome very fine &s;treets, particularly the R&uuml;e Neuve, and the R&uuml;e de Po. The celebrated architect Bernini was of opinion, that there was not a &s;treet in Italy comparable to the fir&s;t of the&s;e; though others think the R&uuml;e de Po is nothing inferior to it. There are al&s;o &s;ome fine &s;quares, and a great many beautiful palaces, be&s;ides that of the king, together with a magnifi|cent opera-hou&s;e, an ar&s;enal, a royal printing-hou&s;e, and the univer&s;ity, which is a quadrangle, and one of the fine&s;t buildings in the city. The king's pa|lace, for the beauty of its apartments, the richne&s;s of the furniture, the elegant paintings, cabinets of curio&s;ities, and library, is &s;carce to be paralleled. The chapel of the Holy Sudary, built of blacki&s;h marble, is particularly admired: they tell us, that this holy &s;udary is the very linen cloth in which the body of our Saviour was wrapped up in the &s;e|pulchre. The city con&s;i&s;ts of the Old and New. In the old, the &s;treets are crooked and narrow, but have &s;ome hand&s;ome hou&s;es in them, and, both in the Old and New, are exceeding clean and neat. From a canal cut from the river Doria, water is conveyed, by an aqueduct, into the city, and after|wards di&s;tributed, at plea&s;ure, through every &s;treet. Here is a fine citadel, and a great many charitable foundations. The univer&s;ity-library, be&s;ides printed books, has a very valuable collection of manu|&s;cripts, in &s;everal languages, among which are Pyrrhus Ligorius's De&s;igns of Greek and Roman Antiquities, in thirty volumes, highly e&s;teemed. The Je&s;uits college and church are very beauti|ful. What chiefly detracts from the beauty of
<PB N="344" REF="3510">
the hou&s;es here, is the great number of pa|per windows. The other defects and inconve|niencies of this city are its thick moi&s;t air in autumn and winter, the foul muddy water in its wells and re&s;ervoirs, and the inns, where the ac|commodations are &s;aid to be very bad, and the impo|&s;itions intolerable. Another thing extremely di&s;a|greeable, and even dangerous, when a per&s;on dies of any contagious di&s;temper, is the carrying the corp&s;e through the &s;treets, and burying it without any coffin. In the neighbourhood of Tu|rin are many beautiful villas, convents, and other buildings. Of the villas, tho&s;e belonging to the royal family are Valentine, now neglected; La Vigne de la Reine; La Venerie, having a very fine chapel and gardens, with a little town near it; Montcalier; Rivoli; and Stupinice. About five leagues from Turin &s;tands the magnificent church and foundation of Superga, on a high mountain, whence, in 1706, the king and prince Eugene reconnoitred the French trenches and camp, and where the former made a vow of this foundation, in ca&s;e he &s;hould defeat the enemy. The revenue of the foundation is eighteen thou&s;and Piedmonte&s;e livres in &s;pecie, by which a prior, with twelve young eccle&s;ia&s;tics of good families, are maintain|ed, and the latter qualified for the highe&s;t prefer|ments in the church. Turin is forty-&s;even miles north-we&s;t from Genoa, eighty &s;outh-we&s;t from Milan, an hundred and &s;even &s;outh-ea&s;t from Ge|neva, and three hundred north-we&s;t from Rome.</P>

Here are to be &s;een the remains of a tri|umphal arch, erected, in honour of Augu&s;tus Cae|&s;ar, by king Cottius, from whom the Alpes Cottiae took their name. Though this place is defended only by a wall, it has always a &s;trong garri&s;on. At about half a quarter of a league from it &s;tands Fort Brunette, which perhaps cannot be paralleled in the whole world, having been hewn out of a rock, with all its out-works. The pa&s;&s;ages in the rock are &s;o large, that waggons and heavy cannon, drawn by &s;everal hor&s;es, may go from one place to another.

<P>In Piedmont, contiguous to Dauphin&eacute; in France, are &s;everal vallies, which in general are very fruit|ful, yielding corn, wine, good pa&s;ture, che&s;nuts, mulberries, and other fruits, with a great variety of plants and herbs, and large woods and thickets, which abound with hares that are white all the year, foxes, large phea&s;ants, brown and white partridges, wolves, and bears. On the higher parts of the mountains, that &s;urround the&s;e vallies, are found the
<PB N="348" REF="3550">
marmottes, which are larger than rabbits, of a brown colour, mixed with red, and their fle&s;h ta&s;tes like pork. They pa&s;s all the cold months in a profound &s;leep. The bouquetin, which is an ani|mal very like a chamois, keeps con&s;tantly on the &s;nowy tops of the highe&s;t mountains. To recover a per&s;on benumbed with cold, or deprived of the u&s;e of a limb, they give a few drops of this ani|mal's blood, in a gla&s;s of warm wine or broth, which throws him into a profu&s;e &s;weat. Among the tame animals is the tumar, engendered between a bull and a mare, or a bull and a &s;he-a&s;s. The for|mer are called buff, and the latter biff. The head and tail in both re&s;emble tho&s;e of an ox; but the former, in&s;tead of horns, has only &s;mall knobs: in all other re&s;pects, they are &s;haped either like an hor&s;e or an a&s;s. They are le&s;s than a mule, but exceeding &s;trong and &s;wift, ea&s;ily kept, and con&s;e|quently fit for travellers. There are many rare plants found among the&s;e mountains; &s;ome of which are reckoned great re&s;toratives, as the lunaria. There is a &s;ort of thi&s;tle, &s;omewhat re&s;embling an artichoke, which is eaten, and reckoned good a|gain&s;t infection. The number of people in the&s;e vallies amount to about &s;even thou&s;and, of which &s;ix thou&s;and are Walden&s;es or Valden&s;es, or Vau|dois, as they are called in French, who are famous in hi&s;tory for their oppo&s;ition to popery, long before the Reformation; and for the many per&s;ecutions they have undergone. For &s;ome time pa&s;t, they have not been much mole&s;ted, though a Roman catholic church hath been built in every pari&s;h; and at Turin there is an ho&s;pital, called Mai&s;on des Vaudois, where all the Walden&s;es, e&s;pecially chil|dren, who voluntarily embrace the Roman catholic religion, are furni&s;hed with every thing nece&s;&s;ary. The girls, when arrived at a proper age, have por|tions given them; and the boys are put to &s;ome me|chanic
<PB N="349" REF="3560">
trade, in order to enable them to acquire a comfortable &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. If the papi&s;ts made u&s;e of no other methods than the&s;e, or &s;uch as the&s;e, to gain pro&s;elytes, they could not be blamed. The chief of the&s;e vallies are tho&s;e of Lucerne, Perou&s;e, St. Martin, Pragela, and Angrogne. In Lucerne there are few or no Walden&s;es. In Pe|rou&s;e is the &s;mall town or fortre&s;s from which it takes its name, and the town of Pignerol. St. Martin takes its name from a place at pre&s;ent quite demoli&s;hed. In the valley of Pragela is Fene&s;|trelle, a fortification on the river Clu&s;on. The valley of Barcelonetta was ceded to France, in lieu of Fort Dauphin, taken by the Spaniards, in 1744. Some of the vallies on the we&s;t &s;ide of the Alps are included in the provinces of Dauphin&eacute; and Provence.</P>

<HEAD>The DUCHY of MONTFERRAT.</HEAD>
<P>This duchy is bounded to the &s;outh by the re|public of Genoa; to the we&s;t and north by Pied|mont; and to the ea&s;t by Milan. It is reckoned about &s;ixty-two miles in length, and forty-eight in breadth. Both its hills and plains are extremely fertile, abounding with corn, wine, and fruits of all forts. It formerly belonged to the dukes of Mo|dena; but a part of it was transferred to the duke of Savoy, in 1631, and the re&s;t, in 1703. On one &s;ide it is watered by the Tanaro, and on the other by the Po. The places of mo&s;t note in it are,</P>
<P>Ca&s;al, the capital, on the river Po, forty-two miles ea&s;t of Turin, and almo&s;t as many we&s;t of Milan. This town was once &s;o well fortified, as

<P>Trino, a &s;trong well-built town, fortified after the modern manner, and &s;ituated eight miles north|we&s;t of Ca&s;al.</P>
<P>Acqui, a fortified town, twelve miles north of Genoa. It was called by the Romans Aquae Sta|tellae, which name was given it on account of &s;ome hot mineral waters in its neighbourhood, much re|&s;orted to for many di&s;tempers. Acqui is evidently a corruption of Aquae.</P>
<P>Alba, &s;urnamed Pompeia, and celebrated by Ptolomy and other antients, as one of the chief cities of old Liguria. It is now a &s;trong fortified town on the river Tanaro, twenty-two miles &s;outh|ea&s;t from Turin.</P>
<P>Nizza della Paglia, a &s;mall town, about nine miles from Acqui, which is well fortified, and the &s;ee of a bi&s;hop. The other towns worth men|tioning in the duchy, are Verua, Cre&s;centino, and St. Salvatore.</P>

<HEAD>The DUCHY of MILAN.</HEAD>
<P>The duchy of Milan is one of the fine&s;t pro|vinces in Italy. It is bounded on the &s;outh by the Apennine mountains, and the territory of Ge|noa; on the north by Switzerland; on the ea&s;t by the Venetian territories, and the duchies of Mantua, Parma, and Placentia; and on the we&s;t by Savoy, Piedmont, and Montferrat; extending from north to &s;outh about an hundred miles, and, from ea&s;t to we&s;t about one hundred and eight. It is well watered by the Te&s;&s;ino, the Se&s;ia, the Ad|da, the Po, the Oglio, the Lombro, Serio, &amp;c. and al&s;o by &s;everal canals and lakes. Of the latter the Lago-Maggiore is between thirty and
<PB N="351" REF="3580">
forty miles in length, and in &s;ome places &s;ix or &s;even miles broad. In it lie the Baromean i&s;lands, as they are called, viz. I&s;ola Bella and I&s;ola Madre, the beauty of which almo&s;t exceeds ima|gination: art and nature &s;eem to have vied with one another in embelli&s;hing them. In each of them is a palace with delicious gardens, belonging to the Baromean family. The water of the lake is clear and of a greeni&s;h colour, and abounds with fi&s;h. The hills, with which it is &s;urrounded, pre&s;ent a mo&s;t charming land&s;kip, being planted with vines, and che&s;nut-trees, inter&s;per&s;ed with &s;ummer-hou&s;es. There is a canal running from it towards Switzerland, with which the city of Milan has a communication. It was antiently called Lacus Verbanus. The Lago de Como, which was called by the Latin poets, Lacus Larius, but has its modern name from the city, near which it lies, extends it&s;elf about thirty miles northward from Como, but its greate&s;t breadth is not above five miles. From the Lago-Maggiore i&s;&s;ues the Te&s;&s;ino; and from that of Como, the Adda. Of the other lakes, that of Lugano and Guarda are the chief: that of Guarda was antiently called Benacus.</P>
<P>The trade and manufactures of this duchy con|&s;i&s;t principally in &s;ilks, &s;tuffs, &s;tockings, gloves, and handkerchiefs, linen and woollen cloth, hardware, curious works of cry&s;tal, agate, hya|cinths, and other gems; but their exports are u&s;ually far &s;hort of their imports.</P>
<P>As to the revenue of the duchy, it mu&s;t, with|out doubt, be very con&s;iderable. It is &s;aid to have amounted to two millions of dollars, while the duchy was in the hands of the Spaniards.</P>
<P>About the year 1525, the emperor Charles V. expelled the French from this duchy, and gave it, together with Spain, to his &s;on Philip II. It re|mained
<PB N="352" REF="3590">
&s;ubject to that crown till 1706, when the Au&s;trians got po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it; but, in 1734, the Spaniards and French recovered it. By a &s;ub&s;e|quent peace, however, it was re&s;tored to the em|peror, on his ceding Naples and Sicily to Spain, and the Au&s;trians have remained ever &s;ince in po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of it, excepting tho&s;e parts of it, that have been ceded to the king of Sardinia. The bounda|ries between the dominions of the king, and tho&s;e of the empre&s;s queen, pa&s;s along from the fron|tiers of Switzerland, through the Lago-maggiore, to the river Te&s;&s;ino, and along that river to its junc|tion with the Po. In 1753, the duke of Modena was appointed governor-general of Milan and the duchy of Mantua, till the young archduke Leo|pold &s;hould be of a proper age to govern.</P>
<P>With regard to the coin of the duchy, twenty &s;oldi make a lira, which is worth about eight|pence &s;terling: &s;even liras and ten &s;oldi are equal to a filippo: twenty-four liras, and between three and four &s;oldi, make a Spani&s;h pi&s;tole: twenty-four liras an Italian pi&s;tole: thirteen liras, &s;ixteen &s;oldi, a ducat in gold: eight liras, a ducatoon of Milan, Venice, or Florence, or a &s;ilver crown: eight liras, ten &s;oldi, a zechin in gold.</P>
<P>In the year 1767, the Au&s;trian government of Milan publi&s;hed a law, by which all the rights, which the pope or the bi&s;hops had had till then exerci&s;ed over eccle&s;ia&s;tics, either with regard to their effects or per&s;ons, is transferred to a council, e&s;tabli&s;hed for that purpo&s;e at Milan. By the &s;ame edict, all eccle&s;ia&s;tics were obliged to &s;ell the e&s;tates which they had become po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;ince the year 1722; and no &s;ubject, whether eccle&s;ia&s;tic or &s;e|cular, was to go to Rome to &s;ollicit any favour, except letters of indulgence, without the con&s;ent of the &s;aid council.</P>

The gardens within the city take up a great deal of ground. In the citadel is a foundery for cannon, and an ar&s;enal, furni&s;hed with arms for twelve thou&s;and men. The governor of it is quite independent of the governor-general of the Milane&s;e, who re&s;ides in the city, in a large, but old, and ill contrived palace. The yearly income of the governor of Milan is &s;aid to be two hun|dred thou&s;and guilders. The council belonging to the city is compo&s;ed of a pre&s;ident and &s;ixty doc|tors of law, who are all nobles, and independent of the governor-general. Milan hath experienced a great variety of fortune, having been &s;ubject &s;ometimes to the French, &s;ometimes to the Spa|niards, and &s;ometimes to the Germans. A great number of per&s;ons of rank and fortune live in it,

e&s;pecially during the winter. The ladies in France are not allowed more liberty than tho&s;e of this city: even the au&s;terities of the mona&s;tic life are &s;o far mitigated here, that gentlemen have not only the liberty of talking with the nuns, and of rallying and laughing at the grate, but al&s;o of joining with them in concerts of mu&s;ic, and of &s;pending whole afternoons in their company. The place where the beau-monde take the air, either in their coaches, or on foot, is the rampart betwixt the Porta Ori|entale, and the Porta To&s;a, where it is &s;trait and broad, and extremely plea&s;ant, being planted with white mulberry trees, and commanding a pro&s;pect, on one &s;ide, of the open country, and on the other, of the gardens and vineyards between the ramparts and the city. Milan, which is &s;aid to have been built by the Gauls, about two hundred years after the foun|dation of Rome, contains a great number of &s;tate|ly edifices, as churches, convents, palaces, and ho&s;pitals. The cathedral is a va&s;t pile, all of mar|ble; and though &s;omething has been doing for near four hundred years towards the outward or in|ward ornament thereof, it is not yet fini&s;hed. Of the great number of &s;tatues about it, that of St. Bartholomew, ju&s;t &s;tead alive, with his &s;kin hang|ing over his &s;houlders, and of Adam and Eve, over the main portal, are the fine&s;t. The pillars &s;upporting the roof of the church are all of marble, and the windows finely painted. This church con|tains a trea&s;ure of great value, particularly a &s;hrine of rock chry&s;tal, in which the body of St. Charles Boromeo is depo&s;ited. The other churches mo&s;t worthy a &s;tranger's notice, are tho&s;e of St. Alex|ander, St. Jerom, St. Giovanni di Ca&s;arotti della Pa&s;&s;ione, that of the Je&s;uits, and of St. Ambro&s;e, in which lie the bodies of the &s;aint, and of the kings Pepin and Bernard.

In the &s;ame college is al&s;o an academy of painting, with a mu&s;aeum, and a li|brary, containing a va&s;t number of printed books and manu&s;cripts; among the la&s;t of which is a tran&s;lation of Jo&s;ephus's Hi&s;tory of the Jews, done by Ruffinus, about twelve hundred years ago, and written on the bark of a tree; St. Ambro&s;e's works on vellum, finely illuminated; the orations of Gregory Nazianzen, and the works of Virgil, in folio, with Petrarch's notes. In the mu&s;aeum are Leonardi da Vinci's mathematical and mechanical drawings, in twelve large volumes. The &s;eminary for &s;ciences, the college of the nobles, the Helve|tian college, and the mathematical academy, are noble foundations, and &s;tately buildings. Of the ho&s;pitals, the mo&s;t remarkable are the Lazaretto, and that called the great ho&s;pital; the latter of which receives &s;ick per&s;ons, foundlings, and lu|natics, and has &s;ix &s;maller ho&s;pitals depending on it, with a revenue of one hundred thou&s;and rix|dollars. The number of the inhabitants of this city is &s;aid to be about two hundred and fifty thou|&s;and. It has been forty times be&s;ieged, taken twenty times, and four times almo&s;t intirely de|moli&s;hed; yet it hath always recovered it&s;elf. It is &s;aid that gunpowder is &s;old here only by one per|&s;on, and in one place: the court of inqui&s;ition is held in the Dominican convent, near the church of Madonna della Gratia: the hou&s;es of entertain|ment, and the ordinaries here, are repre&s;ented as very indifferent. Mr. Key&s;ler &s;ays, it is not unu|&s;ual for young travellers, when they go to any of the taverns in Milan, to be a&s;ked, whether they chu&s;e a letto fornito, or female-bedfellow, who continues ma&s;ked till &s;he enters the bed-chamber. Deformed dwarfs, and people with wens, &s;ome of them of a prodigious &s;ize, are very common in the &s;treets of Milan. The wens are &s;aid to be heredi|tary.

The common method of burying here, is to throw the corp&s;es into vaults, without coffins, to the amount of two or three hundred, which can|not fail to fill the air in the&s;e places with noxious effluvia. Mr. Key&s;ler tells us, that when he was at Milan, goods of any kind might have been brought into the city without &s;earch or enquiry, provided a &s;mall gratuity was given to the officer. Milan is far &s;hort of Turin, both in beauty and conveniency, many of the &s;treets being crooked and narrow, and paper windows much more frequent than in that city; even in grand palaces, the windows are often compo&s;ed promi&s;cuou&s;ly of gla&s;s and paper. It is not uncommon here for beggars, when they a&s;k alms, to hold out to you a di&s;h, in which is a human &s;kull. Two large canals extend from hence, the one to the Te&s;&s;ino, and the other to the Adda; the Te&s;&s;ino having a communication with the Lago Maggiore, and, by a canal, with the Se&s;ia; and the Adda i&s;&s;uing from the Lago di Como, and having a communication by canals with the Lam|bro and Serio. In a void &s;pace in one of the &s;treets of Milan, where &s;tood the hou&s;e of a barber, who had con&s;pired with the commi&s;&s;ary of health to poi&s;on his fellow-citizens, is erected a pillar, called Colonna Infame, with an in&s;cription, to perpetuate the memory of the execrable de&s;ign. The environs of this city are very plea&s;ant, being adorned with beautiful &s;eats, gardens, orchards, &amp;c. About two Italian miles from it, at the &s;eat of the Simo|netti family, is a building, that would have been a ma&s;ter-piece of its kind, had the architect de|&s;igned it for an artificial echo. It will return or repeat the report of a pi&s;tol above &s;ixty times, and any &s;ingle mu&s;ical in&s;trument, well touched, will have the &s;ame effect as a great number of in&s;tru|ments, and produce a mo&s;t &s;urpri&s;ing and de|lightful concert.

<HEAD>The DUCHY of MANTUA.</HEAD>
<P>This duchy is encompa&s;&s;ed by the duchies of Milan and Modena, the eccle&s;ia&s;tical &s;tate, and the territories of Venice; being in length from ea&s;t to we&s;t about &s;ixty miles, and in breadth from &s;ix or &s;even to about thirty-five. It is well watered by the Po, and &s;everal &s;maller rivers and canals, which contribute greatly to its fertility; &s;o that it pro|duces plenty of corn, flax, fruit, and excellent pa&s;tu|rage for a good breed of cattle and hor&s;es, with &s;ome wine. This country was long po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the family of Gonzaga; fir&s;t as marqui&s;&s;es, and after|wards as dukes. The la&s;t duke, Charles IV. &s;iding with the French, in the war about the &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion to the crown of Spain, and admitting a French garri&s;on into his capital, was put under the ban of the empire, under which he died in 1708, after the Imperiali&s;ts had over-run the whole duchy: ever &s;ince, it hath been in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria, and now makes a part of the government of Milan. The revenue of it, while in the hands of its own dukes, is &s;aid to have a|mounted to five hundred and nine thou&s;and crowns. The principal places in it are,</P>
<P>Mantua, which gives name to it, and is its capi|tal. It is one of the antiente&s;t cities in Italy, having been founded, as &s;ome think, even before Rome it&s;elf, and &s;tands in a mar&s;h or lake, formed by

The walls are &s;aid to be four miles in circuit, and the number of the inhabitants (exclu&s;ive of the Imperial garri&s;on, and four or five thou&s;and Jews, who live in a particular quarter, and have &s;everal &s;ynagogues) about &s;ixteen thou|&s;and. Here are a great many convents and churches, with &s;ome fine &s;quares, &s;treets, and hou&s;es; but the city is much declined from what it was when it had dukes of its own. The riding|&s;chool, it is &s;aid, has not its equal; and the cour&s;e is al&s;o well contrived. The ducal palace is old, and now much neglected; but the church be|longing to it has a va&s;t collection of riches, gold and &s;ilver crucifixes, &s;tatues, and &s;ome good pic|tures. Mantua is an epi&s;copal &s;ee, dependent on the pope. The cathedral, of which Julio Romano was the architect, contains &s;ome fine paintings, particularly a night-piece, by Paul Verone&s;e. There are three &s;uburbs belonging to this city, on the other &s;ide of the lake. The river Mincio di|vides it almo&s;t into two equal parts, and has &s;ix bridges over it. In the church of St. Andrew they pretend to have &s;ome of the blood of Chri&s;t, which is &s;hewn once a-year to the people. The univer|&s;ity here was founded in the year 1625. The &s;ilk manufacture, which once brought large &s;ums into the country, is now incon&s;iderable. A little way from Mantua is Pietola, formerly Andes, the vil|lage where Virgil was born; and near it is a grot|to, to which that great poet is &s;aid to have often retired for &s;tudy.</P>

<HEAD>The DUCHIES of PARMA and PLACENTIA.</HEAD>
<P>The&s;e duchies have always been united. By the treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle, in 1748, they were ceded, by the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria and the king of Sardinia, to the infant Don Philip, &s;econd brother to Don Carlos, the pre&s;ent king of Spain, and to his law|ful heirs male. The pre&s;ent duke is the &s;on of Don Philip, and a minor. To the north and we&s;t the&s;e duchies are bounded by the Milane&s;e; to the &s;outh by the territories of Genoa; and to the ea&s;t by the duchy of Modena. They are very fertile and delightful, producing plenty of corn of all &s;orts, wine, oil, che&s;nuts, truffles, and rich pa&s;|turage, which feed great numbers of cattle. The chee&s;es made here are now inferior to tho&s;e of the Lode&s;an, and other parts; but there are &s;till good &s;ilk, woollen, and linen manufactures, with &s;ome &s;alt-works, mineral &s;prings, copper and iron-mines, chalk, chry&s;tals, and petroleum or rock-oil, of which &s;ome is found without any mixture of water, and
<PB N="364" REF="3710">
&s;ome floating on the &s;urface of it. The&s;e duchies were long po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the family of Farne&s;e, de|&s;cended from a natural &s;on of pope Paul III. as fiefs of the papal &s;ee, to which they paid an yearly acknowledgment of ten thou&s;and crowns; but they are now fiefs of the empire. The revenue of the duke is computed at upwards of five hundred thou&s;and crowns per annum. In 1767, the order of the Je&s;uits was &s;uppre&s;&s;ed here; and an edict was publi&s;hed by the regency, with re&s;pect to eccle&s;i|a&s;tical affairs, which almo&s;t entirely &s;ecludes the Roma &s;ee from all juri&s;diction in the duchy. The places of $$o&s;t note in it are,</P>
<P>Parma, which gives name to one of the duchies, being a large populous city, on the river Parma, from which it takes its name, and by which it is di|vided into two parts, connected together by &s;everal bridges. It is &s;aid to be about four Italian miles in circumference, and to contain between forty and fifty thou&s;and inhabitants, with many fine &s;treets and hou&s;es. The ducal palace con&s;i&s;ts of three courts, two of which are new. The large theatre here, built by Renatus I. in 1618, is famous throughout Europe: it is &s;aid, that it will contain upwards of &s;even thou&s;and &s;pectators, and is &s;o contrived, that a word &s;poken, ever &s;o low, on the &s;tage, is heard di&s;tinctly all over the pit; nor does any confu&s;ed reduplication or echo happen, if the voice is rai&s;ed ever &s;o high. The ducal palace con|tained a very valuable collection of pictures, medals, antiquities, and curio&s;ities, until Don Carlos carried off mo&s;t of them, together with the fine library, to Naples, when he became king thereof, in 1748. Here is an univer&s;ity, founded in 1599; and an academy, in 1601. In the latter, young noblemen and gentlemen are in&s;tructed, at a very ea&s;y rate, in all the arts and &s;ciences, and genteel accompli&s;h|ments, becoming their rank; and in the German,

French, Spani&s;h, and Italian languages: the Je|&s;uits, before their expul&s;ion, had the direction of it. There are a great many fine churches, be&s;ides the cathedral, and a bapti&s;tery, the out&s;ide of which is covered with marble, and where all the children born in the city, and within two miles of it, are bap|tized. Its chief trade is in &s;ilk, and &s;ilk &s;tock|ings. There is a citadel on each &s;ide of the city, but the other fortifications are not remarkable. The bi&s;hop of this &s;ee is under the archbi&s;hop of Bologna, though formerly under that of Ravenna. The hou&s;es here are mo&s;tly painted on the out&s;ide, like tho&s;e of Genoa. In the cour&s;e, the quality and gentry take the air in their coaches, as at Lon|don in Hyde-park. In the Capuchin church, among other noble per&s;ons of his family, lies buried the illu&s;trious hero Alexander Farne&s;e, the third duke of Parma, who leaped, the fir&s;t man, &s;word in hand, into the Turki&s;h gallies, at the battle of Lepanto, when only in the eighteenth year of his age. This city is much celebrated by Livy, Ci|cero, and other Roman authors, for its beauty and opulence, and the integrity and valour of its citi|zens; and, by Martial, for its fine woollen manu|factures. The air here is very &s;erene and healthful, and the &s;ituation delightful. One of the duke's coaches is &s;aid to be of beaten &s;ilver, with the in|&s;ide, &s;eats, and curtains, of the fine&s;t embroidery in gold and &s;ilver. This city &s;tands nineteen miles from the Po, thirty-five miles ea&s;t of Modena, &s;e|venty-three north-we&s;t from Florence, &s;eventy-&s;even &s;outh-ea&s;t from Milan, and two hundred from Rome.</P>

of which two thou&s;and are &s;aid to be monks, nuns, and other eccle&s;ia&s;tics. The citadel is pretty &s;trong, but the other fortifications incon&s;iderable. It is &s;aid to have its name from its delightful &s;itua|tion in the mid&s;t of a &s;pacious fertile plain, where the pa&s;tures are &s;o rich, being watered, at plea&s;ure, by means of &s;mall &s;luices, which convey water from the Po, that fifty cows will yield as much milk as is &s;ufficient to make a chee&s;e of an hundred-weight, every day. Of the&s;e chee&s;es there are three &s;orts, for the colouring of which &s;affron is generally u&s;ed. Here is an univer&s;ity, a ducal palace, and a &s;tately cathedral, with a fine church, called St. Maria in Campagna. The main &s;treet, &s;tiled Stradone, is a very fine one. In the ve&s;try of the church of the Augu&s;tines is a curious repre&s;entation of the cru|cifixion of our Saviour, cut in wood, by an un|known hand; and before the town-hou&s;e are two admirable &s;tatues, in bra&s;s, of duke Alexander, and Renatus IV. of the hou&s;e of Farne&s;e.

<P>This duchy had long dukes of its own, de|&s;cended from the hou&s;e of Mantua. The la&s;t duke, Jo&s;eph Maria, died in 1746, without male i&s;&s;ue; upon which the empre&s;s queen Maria Te|re&s;a, took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the duchy, but in 1748, yield|ed it up to Don Philip, agreeably to the treaty of Aix - la - Chapelle. It is about twelve miles in length, and five in breadth. The places in it worth mentioning are,</P>
<P>Gua&s;talla, which gives name to it, and is its capital, &s;tanding on the river Cro&s;tolo, about three miles from the Po, and eighteen north-ea&s;t from Parma. It is a &s;mall town, but well fortified.</P>

<HEAD>The DUCHY of MODENA.</HEAD>
<P>This duchy is bounded on the &s;outh by Tu&s;cany and the republic of Lucca; on the north, by the duchy of Mantua; and on the ea&s;t, by the Bo|logne&s;e, and the territories of the church; and
<PB N="368" REF="3750">
on the we&s;t, by the duchy of Parma; extending in length, from &s;outh to north about fifty-&s;ix Eng|li&s;h miles, and in breadth between twenty-four and thirty-&s;ix, and yielding plenty of corn, wine, and fruits, with mineral waters. In &s;ome places al&s;o, petroleum is &s;kimmed off the &s;urface of the water of deep wells, made on purpo&s;e; and in others is found a kind of earth or tophus, which when pulverized, is an excellent remedy again&s;t poi&s;on, fevers, dy&s;enteries, and hypochondriac di&s;orders. The country of La Sal&s;a affords &s;e|veral kinds of petrefactions. The principal ri|vers are the Cro&s;tolo, Secchia, and Panaro. The family of E&s;t&eacute;, dukes of Modena, is very an|tient. They had their name from E&s;t&eacute;, a &s;mall city, in the di&s;trict of Padua. In 1753, the pre|&s;ent duke was appointed imperial vicar-general, field-mar&s;hal, and governor of the Milane&s;e during the minority of the archduke Peter Leopold, who was declared governor-general of the Au&s;trian Lombardy. The duke, though a va&s;&s;al of the empire, hath an unlimited power, within his own dominions, in which the principal places are,</P>
<P>Modena, an antient city, in Latin Mutina, which gives name to the duchy, and is its capital. It &s;tands twenty-eight miles ea&s;t of Parma, forty-four almo&s;t &s;outh of Mantua, and twenty we&s;t of Bologna, and is a pretty large and populous, but not a hand&s;ome city. It is much celebrated by Roman authors, for its grandeur and opulence; but was a great &s;ufferer by the &s;iege it underwent during the troubles of the triumvirate. It hath long been the u&s;ual re&s;idence of the dukes, and is al&s;o the &s;ee of a bi&s;hop, who is &s;uffragan to the archbi&s;hop of Bologna. In the cathedral, which is a large unwieldy building, is the Secchia rapita, or bucket, of which Ta&s;&s;o hath given the hi&s;tory in a very diverting manner. Mr. Key&s;ler &s;ays,

This city hath given birth to &s;everal celebrated per&s;ons, particularly Ta&s;&s;o the poet, Corregio the great painter, Sigo|nius the civilian and hi&s;torian, da Vignola the architect, and Montecuculi the imperial general. The tutelary &s;aint of it, is named Geminianus. The ducal palace is a very noble edifice, in which, among the other fine pictures, the birth of Chri&s;t by Corregio, called la Notte Felice, is much celebrated. The only manufacture for which this city is noted, is that of ma&s;ks, of which great numbers are exported. The churches of the Je&s;uits, of the Theatines, and of St. Dominic, are well worth viewing. In the college of St. Carlo Borromeo, between &s;eventy and eighty young noblemen are continually maintained, and in&s;tructed both in the &s;ciences and genteel exerci&s;es. St. Beatrix, who was of the family of E&s;t&eacute;, is &s;aid to knock always at the gate of the palace three days before any of the family dies. Before mo&s;t of the hou&s;es are covered walks, or porticos, as at Bologna. The city is fortified, and on its &s;outh &s;ide &s;tands the citadel.</P>

<HEAD>The REPUBLIC of GENOA.</HEAD>
<P>There are few &s;tates in the world that have pa&s;&s;ed through &s;o many revolutions and forms of government as this. After the declen&s;ion of the Roman empire, the Ligures or Genoe&s;e fell under the dominion of the O&s;trogoths, Ea&s;tern emperors, and Lombards. After the la&s;t of the&s;e were expelled Italy by Charlemagne, they ac|knowledged the German emperors as their &s;ove|reigns for &s;ome time; but at la&s;t erected them|&s;elves into an independent &s;tate. In the year 806, they were become &s;o powerful by their flouri&s;hing
<PB N="372" REF="3790">
trade, that they made them&s;elves ma&s;ters of the i&s;land of Cor&s;ica. In the twelfth century, they made great conque&s;ts in Sardinia, Sicily, the Crim, on the Black Sea, and in the neighbourhood of Genoa; but the war in which they afterwards engaged with Venice, for the &s;uperiority at &s;ea, weakened them greatly. In the la&s;t century inte&s;tine di|vi&s;ions brought them &s;o low, that they were fain to put them&s;elves under the protection of other powers, of whom France treated them in a very tyrannical manner, until they were delivered by Andrew Doria, who e&s;tabli&s;hed their pre&s;ent form of government. They have &s;ince made a &s;hift to maintain their liberty, though they have &s;uffered con&s;iderable lo&s;&s;es, and met with rude &s;hocks and in&s;ults from their powerful neighbours. In 1684, they were bombarded by the French: in 1730, Cor&s;ica revolted, and hath never been entirely re|covered &s;ince; but &s;o great an army hath been lately tran&s;ported thither from France, in con&s;e|quence of a treaty with the Genoe&s;e, by which the French undertook the reduction of the i&s;land, or, as &s;ome &s;ay, purcha&s;ed it, that the poor Cor&s;icans, in all probability, will &s;oon be obliged to bend their necks to the poli&s;hed, but galling yoke of French tyranny.</P>
<P>In the war that was terminated by the treaty of Aix la-Chapelle, they took part with France and Spain, and in con&s;equence of that, were attacked on all hands, by the Imperiali&s;ts, the king of Sar|dinia, and the Engli&s;h fleet. The fir&s;t even made them&s;elves ma&s;ters of Genoa, but were &s;oon after expelled from it with a terrible &s;laughter.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the form of government, it is ari&s;tocratical. The doge or duke, who mu&s;t be at lea&s;t fifty years of age, and di&s;engaged from all trade, is cho&s;en only for two years, either out of the antient, or modern nobility. After the ex|piration of the two years, he cannot be cho&s;en

again for five, but is intitled to a procurator's place, and a pen&s;ion. The legi&s;lative power is lodged in the great council or &s;enate, con&s;i&s;ting of four hundred nobles, of which four parts in five mu&s;t agree to every law that is made. The le&s;&s;er council con&s;i&s;ts of a hundred, and is a &s;ort of com|mittee of the former. The admini&s;tration is ve&s;ted in the doge, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by twelve governatori, and eight procuratori, who continue in office as long as the doge, and are a &s;ort of council to him, three of the former, and two of the latter, living in the ducal palace with him three months, when they give place to as many new ones. The doge has the title of &s;erenity during his office, and a guard of two hundred Germans. There are &s;e|veral other boards and tribunals, as the &s;yn|dics, the commi&s;&s;aries of peace, and the laws, the cen&s;ors, the admini&s;trators of the bank of St. George, the rotas, &amp;c. The making of laws, and rai&s;ing money, belongs to the great council; but war, peace, and alliances, to the le&s;&s;er. The nobility are divided into new and old: of the for|mer are twenty-eight families, of which tho&s;e of Doria, Fie&s;chi, Spinola, Grimaldi, and Imperiali, are the chief; of the latter about five hundred: both are equally capable of employments; a noble|man of fifteen years &s;tanding, is qualified to be cho&s;en doge. All of them trade, at lea&s;t in the whole&s;ale way, except the Dorias and Spinolas, and they all wear black in the city, and have the title of excellency; but the greater part of them, it is &s;aid, have not above five hundred pounds a year.</P>
<P>Their public revenues, we are told, do not a|mount to a million and a half of crowns per an|num. The government has the monopoly of corn and wine, &s;o that the bakers mu&s;t fetch their wheat from the public granaries, and the wine-&s;ellers
<PB N="374" REF="3810">
from the public cellars. As a great part of the e&s;tates of the nobility lie in the kingdom of Naples, and Spain owes them great &s;ums, they are under a &s;ort of nece&s;&s;ity of taking part with that crown, when a war breaks out. The cu&s;toms are another con&s;iderable branch of the revenue, to make up the deficiencies of which, the &s;tate has frequently been obliged to borrow large &s;ums, at a high intere&s;t, which gave ri&s;e to the bank of St. George.</P>
<P>In time of peace the republic keeps on foot u&s;ually a body of five thou&s;and regulars, of which a part are foreigners. There is al&s;o a militia. During the war before la&s;t, they had eighteen thou&s;and men in pay. Their naval force, once &s;o formidable, is now reduced to &s;ix gallies.</P>
<P>The e&s;tabli&s;hed religion of the Genoe&s;e domi|nions is the Roman catholic, and no other is tole|rated. The inqui&s;ition has full power here, as it has in mo&s;t other &s;tates of Italy.</P>
<P>As to the coin of Genoa, twelve denari make one &s;oldi, twenty &s;oldi one lira, which is about eight pence three-fifths &s;terling, five lira are equal to a piece of eight; nine liras eight &s;oldi make a &s;cude d'oro, or half a doppia di Spagna, &s;even liras twelve &s;oldi make a &s;cudo d'argento, four liras a &s;cudo di cambio, five liras eight &s;oldi a philippe di Milano, nineteen liras two &s;oldi current a dop+pia d'E&s;pagna French weight; eighteen liras &s;ix+teen &s;oldi a doppia de Genoa.</P>
<P>The Genoe&s;e territories extend along that part of the Mediterranean &s;ea, commonly called the gulph of Genoa, about one hundred and fifty-two miles, but their breadth is very unequal, being from eight to about twenty miles.

Placentia, Parma, the dukedom of Tu&s;cany, and the republic of Lucca. This tract, though a great part of it is mountainous, and &s;ome of that bar|ren enough, yet produces plenty of excellent fruit, good pa&s;ture, wood, garden-&s;tuff, and mulberry|trees, with &s;ome wine and oil, but little corn. What they want of the la&s;t, they have either from Lombardy, Sicily, or Naples.</P>
<P>The dominions of the republic on the continent, are divided into the Riviera di Levante, i. e. the ea&s;tern coa&s;t, and the Riviera di Ponente, or the we&s;tern coa&s;t. In the former the principal places are,</P>
<P>Genoa, the capital of its dominions, as it was of the antient Liguria. Modern writers call it, in Latin, Janua, but the Romans always &s;tiled it Genua. It is celebrated by antient authors, as a rich and opulent city, and Strabo calls it the em|porium of Liguria. It &s;tands on the coa&s;t of the Mediterranean &s;ea, at the bottom of a little gulph, partly on the flat, and partly on the declivity of a plea&s;ant hill, in con&s;equence of which it appears to great advantage from the &s;ea. It is defended on the land &s;ide by a double wall, which, in cir|cumference, is about ten Italian miles. The New and Balbi-&s;treets con&s;i&s;t entirely of a double &s;trait row of magnificent palaces. The others, though clean and well paved, are crooked and narrow. There are three places from which one may have a full view of the city, viz. about a mile off at &s;ea, from the top of the light-hou&s;e, and the hill, on the &s;ide of which it is built. The beauty of the pro&s;pect is much heightened by the lemon and orange-trees, evergreens, and flowering &s;hrubs, on the tops of hou&s;es, and in the gardens. The &s;uburb of San Pietro d'Arena, is full of noble hou&s;es, built with exqui&s;ite ta&s;te. The palaces of the nobility are almo&s;t all of marble, and many of them are painted on the out&s;ide. That there
<PB N="376" REF="3830">
&s;hould be &s;uch a profu&s;ion of marble here, is not to be wondered at, as the neighbouring hills a|bound with it. The city contains a va&s;t number of palaces, churches, and convents, and &s;everal ho&s;pitals. Of the palaces tho&s;e of the family of Doria, Pellavicini, Lercari, Carriga, Balbi, and Durazzo are the fine&s;t. The palace, where the doge re&s;ides, and where the great and little coun|cil, and the two colleges of the procuratori, and governatori a&s;&s;emble, is a large &s;tone building in the center of the city; but it contains &s;ome fine paintings in fre&s;co, two &s;tatues of Andrew and John Doria in white marble, and an ar&s;enal, in which are &s;aid to be arms for thirty-four thou&s;and men, with a &s;hield, containing one hundred and twenty pi&s;tol barrels, and thirty-three coats of mail, which it is pretended, were worn by as many Genoe&s;e heroines in a croi&s;ade. Of the churches the fine&s;t are tho&s;e of the annunciation, St. Mary Carignan, St. Dominic, and St. Martha. In the cathedral is a di&s;h made of a &s;ingle emerald. All the inhabitants here, except the principal ladies, who are carried in chairs, walk on foot, on ac|count of the narrowne&s;s or &s;teepne&s;s of the &s;treets. The fortifications of the city towards the &s;ea are remarkably &s;trong. There are two fine &s;tone-bridges over the rivers Bonzevera and Bi&s;agno, the fir&s;t whereof wa&s;hes the we&s;t, and the other the ea&s;t &s;ide of the city, within which there is al&s;o a &s;urpri&s;ing &s;tone-bridge, joining two hills. The harbour, though large, is far from being &s;afe; but no care or expence have been &s;pared, to render it as &s;afe and commodious as po&s;&s;ible. The wind to which it is mo&s;t expo&s;ed, is that called Labeccio, or the &s;outh-we&s;t. The place where the republic's gallies lie, is called the Dar&s;ena, where are a great number of Turki&s;h &s;laves. On a rock, on the we&s;t &s;ide of the harbour is the fanal, or light-hou&s;e,
<PB N="377" REF="3840">
a high tower, on the top of which is a lanthorn, containing thirty-&s;ix lamps. The trade of Genoa is chiefly in velvets, dama&s;ks, plu&s;h, and other &s;ilks, brocades, lace, gloves, &s;weetmeats, fruits, oil, Parme&s;an chee&s;e, anchovies, and medicinal drugs from the Levant; but the badne&s;s of the harbour, and the high price of commodities, greatly check its commerce. In 1751 Genoa was declared a free port for ten years, under certain re&s;trictions: in that called Porto Franco, any merchant may have a ware hou&s;e, and import or export goods du|ty-free; but &s;uch as are di&s;po&s;ed of in the city, or on the continent, are taxed pretty high. The no|bility are allowed to trade in the whole&s;ale way, to carry on velvet, &s;ilk, and cloth manufactures, and to have &s;hares in merchant &s;hips; and &s;ome of them, as the Palavacini, are actually the great|e&s;t merchants in Genoa. Another very profitable article of trade carried on by them is banking, and dealing in bills of exchange. A new academy of painting, &s;culpture, civil and military architec|ture, was in&s;tituted here in 1751. One may walk the &s;treets of Genoa in the night with the greate&s;t &s;afety, which is more than can be &s;aid of many cities in Italy. Exce&s;&s;ive &s;plendor and luxury are, in &s;everal re&s;pects, re&s;trained by &s;alutary laws. Every married lady here has her cize&s;beo, who con&s;tanly waits upon her, and performs all the of|fices of a lover, without incroaching, as he pre|tends, upon the privileges of the hu&s;band. Such intimacies, however, are thought to be often car|ried farther. No beggars are permitted to a&s;k alms in Genoa, and the inns are better than tho&s;e at Turin. When a &s;ingle per&s;on is buried, a kind of garland of all &s;orts of artificial flowers is placed on the coffin. The Genoe&s;e in general are e&s;teemed crafty, indu&s;trious, and inured to labour above the other Italians. Here, as in mo&s;t other

At the treaty of Worms, the queen of Hungary re&s;igned all her preten&s;ions to the town and marqui&s;ate of Final, to the king of Sardinia, upon condition, that he repayed the Genoe&s;e their purcha&s;e-money, and made Final a free-port.

<HEAD>The REPUBLIC of VENICE.</HEAD>
<P>This &s;tate, like many others, ro&s;e from very &s;mall beginnings. That groop of &s;mall i&s;lands, where the city of Venice now &s;tands, was originally inha|bited only by fi&s;hermen; but when Italy was in|vaded, fir&s;t by Alaric, king of the Goths, and af|terwards by Attila, king of the Huns, who &s;pread ruin and de&s;olation wherever they came, great numbers of people, who lived near the Adriatic, fled to the&s;e i&s;les, with all their wealth. From that time a city gradually ro&s;e, which at la&s;t, in the cour&s;e of &s;everal centuries, attained to a high de|gree of power, and a much more exten&s;ive domi|nion than it at pre&s;ent po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es, tho' that is far from being incon&s;iderable. Like Genoa it was indebt|ed, in a great mea&s;ure, for its power and wealth to commerce; for before the Portugue&s;e di&s;covered a pa&s;&s;age to India by the Cape of Good Hope, the Venetians purcha&s;ed the merchandize of the Ea&s;t at Alexandria, and other ports in the Levant, and di&s;per&s;ed them all over Europe; in con&s;equence of which they became immen&s;ely rich and power|ful, but have declined ever &s;ince they lo&s;t that trade. Exclu&s;ive of what they are now po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of, they were once ma&s;ters of the i&s;lands of Rhodes, Scio, Samos, Mytilene, Andros, Candia, the Morea, with the cities of Gallipoli, and The&s;&s;alo|nica; and in 1194, in conjunction with the French, they even took the city of Con&s;tantinople, and re|mained

&s;ome time in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a part of that em|pire. They al&s;o di&s;puted the dominion of Scla|vonia, Croatia, Morlachia, and Dalmatia, with the king of Hungary, and contended with the Genoe&s;e for the empire of the &s;ea with various &s;uc|ce&s;s; but of a great part of the&s;e, and their other conque&s;ts, they have &s;ince been &s;tripped, chiefly by the Turks.</P>
<P>As to the government of this &s;tate, it was at fir&s;t ve&s;ted in con&s;uls, afterwards in tribunes. A|bout the beginning of the eighth century, a doge, or duke, was elected, and ve&s;ted with unlimited power; but in 1171, the power of the doge was much abridged, and a council of two hundred and forty per&s;ons, compo&s;ed of commons as well as no|bles, was appointed. Soon after, under duke Marino Moro&s;ini, the pre&s;ent form of electing the doge was introduced. In 1296, the government became ari&s;tocratical, the privilege of &s;itting in the great council being then confined to the nobility, in whom alone the &s;upreme authority at pre&s;ent is ve&s;ted. The number of nobles amounts to about two thou&s;and. All tho&s;e are members of the &s;e|nate, but, according to their antiquity, &s;ome are accounted more honourable than others. One cla&s;s, and that the lowe&s;t, con&s;i&s;ts of the po&s;te|rity of tho&s;e, who, in the nece&s;&s;itous times of the commonwealth, purcha&s;ed their nobility for one hundred thou&s;and ducats. The nobles have the title of excellency, and wear, at lea&s;t when in the city, a black furred gown reaching to their heels, with long caps and periwigs. Some of them are &s;o poor, that they are fain to beg of the rich. The nobility in their dominions on the continent, though &s;ome of them are of very antient families, are ex|cluded from all offices, and treated with great in|&s;olence and contempt by their haughty lords. At the head of the government is the doge, who&s;e
<PB N="383" REF="3900">
office was once hereditary, and power ab&s;olute; but the former is now elective, and the latter very much circum&s;cribed: indeed he is no more than a gaudy &s;lave, loaded with fetters, which one would think could not be much the lighter for being gilt; yet &s;o much is the human heart captivated with external pomp and pageantry, that the office, for the mo&s;t part, is eagerly &s;ought after: but &s;hould one, otherwi&s;e inclined, be cho&s;en, he cannot de|cline it, without expo&s;ing him&s;elf to bani&s;hment, and confi&s;cation of his effects. Though the power of the doge is very &s;mall, his &s;tate and retinue are very &s;plendid: his title is that of &s;erenity, and his office for life: he is &s;aid to be a king with regard to his robes, a &s;enator in the council-hou&s;e, a pri|&s;oner in the city, and a private man out of it. The yearly revenue of his office is about four thou&s;and pounds; and though he may be depo&s;ed, he can|not re&s;ign his dignity. All the nobility have a &s;eat in the great council, unle&s;s they are under twenty-five years of age. In this council the &s;u|preme authority and legi&s;lative power is ve&s;ted. Next to it is the &s;enate, or pregradi, which con|&s;i&s;ts of about two hundred and fifty members, who have the power of making peace or war, and fo|reign alliances, of appointing amba&s;&s;adors, fixing the &s;tandard of the coins, impo&s;ing duties and taxes, and all offices by &s;ea and land are in their gift. The third council con&s;i&s;ts of the doge and his &s;ix coun&s;ellors, in which all letters and in&s;truments re|lating to the &s;tate are read, amba&s;&s;adors admitted to audience, and other important affairs tran&s;acted. The other colleges are the council of ten, which decides all criminal ca&s;es without appeal, and to which even the doge him&s;elf is &s;ubject: the pro|curators of St. Mark, who&s;e office is very lucrative, and who decide with re&s;pect to wills, guardian|&s;hips, and the making a proper provi&s;ion for the

poor; and the &s;tate inqui&s;ition, who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s it is to provide for the public tranquility. In the wall of the ducal palace are heads of lions and leopards, with open mouths, to receive informations of any plot or trea&s;on again&s;t the &s;tate. The eccle&s;ia&s;tical, or holy inqui&s;ition as it is called; but the power of this court, &s;o formidable in other countries, is here under great re&s;trictions. Here is al&s;o a particular college for the regulation of dre&s;s, but their juri&s;|diction does not extend to &s;trangers.</P>
<P>The principal Venetian order of knighthood is that of St. Mark, the badge of which is a large gold medal, dependent on the brea&s;t. The order of Con&s;tantine knights wear a cro&s;s hanging from a gold chain.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to religion, that of the Venetians is the Roman catholic; but they are no bigots. We have already ob&s;erved, that the court of inqui&s;ition here is under very great re&s;trictions, and the pope is con&s;idered as little more than a temporal prince, his &s;upremacy being rejected. The prie&s;ts, monks, and nuns, may take almo&s;t what liberties they plea&s;e, provided they do not meddle with the &s;tate. What relates to Jews, Greeks, witchcraft, and the like, is not cognizable by the inqui&s;ition; but on|ly here&s;y, and the abu&s;e of the &s;acraments. In &s;hort, the church is entirely under the controul of the &s;tate. At the head of the former is the patriarch, but he has very little power; next to him is the primate, and then the archbi&s;hops and bi&s;hops. In our account of Carniola we ob&s;erved, that by an agreement between the court of Vienna and the Venetians, the patriarchate of Aquileia was to cea&s;e at the death of the then patriarch, and an archbi&s;hopric to be erected in&s;tead of it, at Udina, in the territories of the republic. Jews, Arme|nians, and Greeks, are allowed the public exerci&s;e of their religion, and prote&s;tants are indulged

in private; but they omit &s;inging p&s;alms in their meetings. The Lutherans of the German factory maintain a preacher of their own, who wears a lay|habit. Though the Je&s;uits have not yet been bani&s;hed from the dominions of the republic, yet, by &s;ome late re&s;olutions of the &s;enate, their power and authority have been greatly curtailed.</P>
<P>The Venetians are &s;till the greate&s;t naval power in Italy. They pretend they could fit out, in ca&s;e of nece&s;&s;ity, &s;ixty men of war, one hundred gal|lies, and ten galea&s;&s;es; though one can hardly imagine how they could man half that number. Mr. Key&s;ler &s;ays, that when he was there, which was about forty years ago, they had in all fifty gal|lies, of which twenty-five were at &s;ea, and the re&s;t in the harbour, ready equipped for &s;ervice, be&s;ides twenty-four men of war on the &s;tocks. He &s;ays further, that four galea&s;&s;es, fifty galliots, with four bomb-galliots, and four advice-boats, are always kept ready rigged in the ar&s;enal; that the trunks of ten thou&s;and trees lie continually in water to be u&s;ed occa&s;ionally; that the annually charge of the docks and yards amounted to five hundred thou|&s;and ducats, at about three &s;hillings and four-pence each; and that, in time of war, the number of artificers was between two or three thou&s;and.</P>
<P>The army is &s;aid to con&s;i&s;t of between twenty and thirty thou&s;and men, the greate&s;t part of which are Dalmatians and Switzers. The commander in chief, &s;tiled capitano, is always a foreigner of di&s;tinction. General Graeme, a Scotchman, lately enjoyed that honourable po&s;t.</P>
<P>The ordinary revenues of the &s;tate are computed at about one million two hundred thou&s;and pounds &s;terling; but, in time of war, they can rai&s;e them greatly. A con&s;iderable part of the revenue ari&s;es from the cu&s;toms, and the duty on &s;alt, made at Cor&s;u and Chioza.</P>
<P><PB N="386" REF="3930">
With re&s;pect to the coins of Venice, a lira, value about &s;ixpence two-fifths &s;terling, is equal to ten ca&s;&s;etti, or twenty &s;oldi; &s;ix liras and a half are equal to one ducat current; five liras and one|&s;ixth are equal to one ducat di banco, or four &s;hil|lings and four-pence &s;terling; twenty-nine liras current, or thirty-&s;ix of the ba&s;er &s;ort, are equal to a doppia, or a Venetian, Spani&s;h, Florentine, and French pi&s;tole; eighteen liras and one-fourth are equal to a zequin; &s;ixteen liras to a ducat of gold, or ongaro; four liras to a large &s;ilver crown; eight liras ten foldi to a Ju&s;tiniana and Filippo.</P>
<P>In the Venetian dominions the governor of a province is &s;tiled proveditore-generale, or governa|tore; and of a large town pode&s;ta, or ca&s;tellano. We now proceed to a more particular de&s;cription of the &s;everal territories belonging to the republic in Italy.</P>
<P>Having already treated of tho&s;e in Dalmatia, and the i&s;lands on the coa&s;t thereof, or that of Greece, we begin with the dogado, or duchy of Venice, con&s;i&s;ting of i&s;lands, and a &s;mall part of the continent, in which the principal places are,</P>
<P>Venice, in Latin, Venetia, or Venetiae, the ca|pital and &s;eat of the republic, &s;tanding at lea&s;t four miles from any part of the terra firma, upon a clu&s;ter of i&s;lands. Its appearance at a di&s;tance is very &s;triking, looking like a great town half float|ed by a deluge. Betwixt the city and the terra firma are a great many &s;hallows, on which, at low water, you may almo&s;t every where touch the bot|tom with a pole; but all po&s;&s;ible care is taken to prevent their becoming dry land. On the &s;outh &s;ide of the city are al&s;o &s;hallows, but on the&s;e there is a greater depth of water. The channels be|twixt them are marked out by &s;takes, or poles, which on the approach of an enemy would certainly be taken away. The city is divided by a va&s;t num|ber
<PB N="387" REF="3940">
of canals, on which ply the gondoliers, or watermen, in their black gondolas or boats. The &s;treets are very clean and neat, but narrow and crooked. There are no carriages, not &s;o much as a chair to be &s;een in them. Though the city, by its &s;ituation, and the great number of &s;teeples, tower|ing above the water, &s;trikes one with admiration at a di&s;tance; yet when he is got into it, it does not an&s;wer his expectation; for excepting the &s;quare of St. Mark, and a few other places, there is nothing grand or beautiful in it, at lea&s;t in compari&s;on of many other cities in Italy. Of the canals, that called Il Canale Maggiore, or the Great Canal, is by far the large&s;t and longe&s;t, and con&s;equently the mo&s;t beautiful. Here races are &s;ometimes run for prizes in the gondolas. On its banks are al&s;o &s;everal &s;tately hou&s;es. Over the&s;e canals are a great number of hand&s;ome bridges of one arch, but with|out any fence on either &s;ide: they are all built of white &s;tone, with which the &s;treets are al&s;o paved, except the Rialto over the great canal, which is all of marble, and co&s;t the republic two hundred and fifty thou&s;and ducats, the arch being ninety feet wide. The canals in &s;ummer are &s;aid to emit a bad &s;mell, from the great quantities of filth con|tinually running into them. The fine&s;t gondolas are tho&s;e in which the foreign mini&s;ters make their public entries, being richly decorated with gilding, painting, and &s;culpture. The number of i&s;lands on which the city &s;tands, according to &s;ome, is &s;ixty, according to others &s;eventy-two. The cir|cumference is about &s;ix Italian miles, and it takes up about two hours to make the circuit of it in a gondola. The inhabitants are &s;uppo&s;ed to be a|bout two hundred thou&s;and, including tho&s;e of the i&s;lands Murano, La Guideca, and tho&s;e who live on board the barges. There are near two hundred &s;prings of fre&s;h water in the city, but the water of
<PB N="388" REF="3950">
many of them is &s;o indifferent, that the principal families pre&s;erve rain-water in ci&s;terns, or are &s;up|plied with water from the Brenta. The mo&s;t re|markable places in the city are the ducal palace, the &s;quare, and church of St. Mark, who is the tutelar &s;aint of Venice, the mint, public library, grand ar&s;enal, &s;everal of the palaces of the nobles, churches, convents, and ho&s;pitals. In the&s;e la&s;t is a prodigious collection of the fine&s;t paintings; Venice, in this re&s;pect, &s;urpa&s;&s;ing even Rome it|&s;elf. The diver&s;ions of the Venetians are chiefly ma&s;querading, e&s;pecially during the carnival, and other fe&s;tivals; ridottos, operas, plays, which are generally wretched performances, and concerts of vocal and in&s;trumental mu&s;ic. During their fe&s;ti|vals, debauchery, riot, and licentiou&s;ne&s;s, are carried to the greate&s;t height. The courtezans here, we are told, are ab&s;olutely lo&s;t to all &s;en&s;e of mo|de&s;ty and common decency. The grand &s;cene of all the &s;hews and follies of the fe&s;tivals, is the &s;quare of St. Mark, in which bulls are &s;ometimes baited. The marriage of the &s;ea on A&s;cen&s;ion|day is one of their greate&s;t &s;olemnities. From the Sunday before A&s;cen&s;ion-day to Whit&s;unday is an annual fair. In the doge's palace all the high col|leges hold their a&s;&s;emblies; but we are told by &s;e|veral travellers, which &s;eems very &s;trange, that the &s;tairs are no better than a privy. In this palace is a &s;mall ar&s;enal, furni&s;hed with arms again&s;t any &s;udden in&s;urrection of the people, together with a &s;tate pri&s;on, a great many exqui&s;ite paintings, and &s;everal curio&s;ities, among which are &s;ome clau&s;tra ca&s;titatis. One &s;ide of it is towards St. Mark's &s;quare, and the lower gallery on that &s;ide, with the hall under the new procuratie facing it, are called the Brog$io, where the nobility, and none el&s;e, at lea&s;t while they are pre&s;ent, are allowed to walk. The &s;quare of St. Mark is the greate&s;t
<PB N="389" REF="3960">
ornament of the city, and hath the form of a pa|rallelogram. In this &s;quare, be&s;ides the church and palace of St. Mark, are two towers, on one of which is a curious clock, and the other has &s;tairs &s;o con&s;tructed, that one may ride up on bor&s;eback: the latter is al&s;o &s;o high, that it is &s;aid, that in a clear day, and when the gilding of the &s;pire was fre&s;h, it could plainly be di&s;cerned an hundred miles from Venice. Oppo&s;ite the ducal palace is the public library of the commonwealth, containing a large collection of books and manu&s;cripts, with &s;ome fine paintings, &s;tatues, and curio&s;ities. Hard by St. Mark's &s;quare is the zecca, or mint: from zecca the gold coin called zecchino takes its name. One of the &s;malle&s;t pieces of money at Venice is called gazetta; and the fir&s;t news papers publi&s;hed there, on a &s;ingle leaf, having been &s;old for that, a piece, all kinds of news-papers were from thence &s;tiled ga|zettes. The grand ar&s;enal is two and a half Italian miles in circuit, and contains va&s;t quantities of naval and other warlike &s;tores: &s;ome pretend, that it could furni&s;h arms for ten thou&s;and hor&s;e and an hundred thou&s;and foot: here are the trophies of Scanderberg and others, with the helmet of Attila, &amp;c. The rope-walk is four hundred and forty-four common paces in length, and the ropes and cables are va|lued at two millions of &s;ilver ducats. In the foun|dery none but bra&s;s cannon are ca&s;t, and an hun|dred men are generally at work in the forges. The &s;alt-petre works here de&s;erve a traveller's no|tice: there is a ve&s;&s;el filled with wine and water, four times a day, where the workmen, though a thou&s;and or more, may drink as much, and as often, as they plea&s;e. Clo&s;e to the Rialto is the bank. There are two academies for painting at Venice, where the di&s;ciples draw from the life. The Ger|man factory contains about five hundred rooms; and is the general magazine for all goods that ei|ther

come from Germany, or are to be &s;ent to that country: here al&s;o the factors and merchants of that country, if unmarried, may re&s;ide. Venice is well &s;upplied with provi&s;ions of all &s;orts, e&s;pecially fi&s;h In the churches are a great many fine monu|ments, and exqui&s;ite paintings. The trade of the city, at pre&s;ent, is far &s;hort of what it was formerly. Their chief manufactures are cloth, e&s;pecially &s;car|let, &s;ilks, looking-gla&s;&s;es, gold and &s;ilver &s;tuffs, brocades, velvets, and paper, of which, and wine, oil, fruit, &s;weet-meats, anchovies, and &s;everal &s;orts of drugs u&s;ed in phy&s;ic and painting, the exports are &s;till con&s;iderable. Venice has neither walls, gates, nor citadel, to defend it, its &s;ituation &s;upply|ing the want of all the&s;e. In the trea&s;ury of re|lics is the protocoll, or original manu&s;cript, as they pretend, of St. Mark's go&s;pel; it is rarely &s;hewn, and the writing, by length of time, is &s;o defaced, that the greate&s;t connoi&s;&s;eurs in manu&s;cripts can|not determine, whether it was wrote in Greek or Latin. Be&s;ides what is properly called the city, there is a multitude of little i&s;lands lying round, which are covered with buildings, and make each of them a kind of &s;eparate town, the mo&s;t con&s;ide|rable of which is that called Guideca, or the Jews Quarter, which is large and populous; with St. Ero&s;mo, St. Helena, St. Georgio, Chio&s;a, Il Li|do de Pale&s;trina, Il Lido de Malamocco, and Mu|rano: the&s;e i&s;lands are a &s;ort of fence to the city, breaking the violence of the waves. To di&s;tin|gui&s;h them from others, the Jews here mu&s;t wear a bit of red cloth in their hats. The gardens in this city are few, and incon&s;iderable: In the i&s;land of Murano are made tho&s;e beautiful looking gla&s;&s;es, and other gla&s;s-works, for which Venice is &s;o much noted: here the family of Cornaro hath a palace, with a gallery of paintings, little &s;hort of an Italian mile in length. The &s;alt-works in the i&s;land of
<PB N="391" REF="3980">
Chio&s;a are of great benefit to the Venetians, and yield a very con&s;iderable revenue. There are &s;eve|ral other &s;mall i&s;lands about Venice, be&s;ides tho&s;e I have mentioned, but they are incon&s;iderable. It is &s;aid the law here allows a nobleman to poi&s;on his wife for adultery, and to cau&s;e her gallant to be poignarded. We had almo&s;t forgot to ob&s;erve, that over the great door of St. Mark's church are four bra&s;s hor&s;es, which were formerly gilt, and are &s;aid to have been brought from Con&s;tantinople: they are univer&s;ally allowed to be ma&s;ter-pieces.

<P>This di&s;trict is exceeding fertile, and well culti|vated. Its greate&s;t length, from north to &s;outh, is about thirty-five miles; and its breadth about twenty-eight, at a medium. The places of mo&s;t note in it are,</P>
<P>Padua, which gives name to it, and is its capital. It was antiently called Patavium, and was one of the riche&s;t and mo&s;t flouri&s;hing cities in Italy; but is now much declined, the number of the inhabi|tants hardly amounting to forty thou&s;and. It &s;tands on the Brenta, about thirty-four miles ea&s;t of Venice, and contains a great number of churches, convents, and &s;everal ho&s;pitals; but the &s;treets are narrow, dirty, and ill-paved. The univer&s;ity here was formerly in great repute; but it hath declined greatly, in con&s;equence of the unbounded licen|tiou&s;ne&s;s

of its &s;cholars. The phy&s;ic garden is &s;upe|rior to mo&s;t, and its arrangement is very elegant and judicious. St. Anthony, who was born at Li&s;bon, in the year 1196, is held in the highe&s;t ve|neration here: indeed, the homage paid him is greater than that paid to Chri&s;t, or God him&s;elf. The church of the Franci&s;cans that is dedicated to him, but e&s;pecially the chapel in which his body lies, are &s;plendid beyond imagination: the very beggars a&s;k alms only in the name of St. Anthony. <Q>One of the votive tables in the chapel is thus in&s;cri|bed: <HI>Exaudit St. Antonius, quos non exaudit Deus,</HI> i. e. &startq;St. Anthony hears tho&s;e whom God him&s;elf does not hear.&endq;</Q> Padua is the &s;ee of a bi&s;hop, who&s;e re|venue exceeds an hundred thou&s;and crowns. In the church of St. Ju&s;tina lies interred the celebrated Cornara, who was born in the year 1646, a lady of extraordinary knowledge in divinity, a&s;tronomy, mathematics, and philo&s;ophy. In the convent of the Dominican monks is &s;hewn a cell, where Al|bertus Magnus is &s;aid to have lived. On the right hand of St. Carlo's altar, in the cathedral, lies the celebrated Charles Patin, who&s;e wife and daughters were al&s;o very learned. Before St Ju&s;tin's church is a large area, formerly called the Campus Martius, and now Prato della Valle, where, the fir&s;t Sunday of every month, a market is held for cattle. A|mong the public edifices, the town-hou&s;e is e&s;teem|ed the mo&s;t magnificent. The Paduans are firmly per&s;uaded, that the bones found in a leaden che&s;t in St. Ju&s;tin's church, in 1414, are actually tho&s;e of Ti|tus Livy, a native of this place. In the pode&s;ta's pa|lace is the city library, and in the Old Ca&s;tle, is an ar|&s;enal and granary: on the river, within a &s;mall di&s;tance of one another, are no le&s;s than thirty mills: the fine&s;t private hou&s;e in the whole city is the Palazzo deSeran|zo: in the palace of count France&s;co Capo de Li&s;ta is a woodenhor&s;e, which Mr. Key&s;ler tells us, his guide

a&s;&s;ured him, was the identical wooden hor&s;e of Troy. Of the gardens, the fine&s;t is that of Papa|fava, in which are hedges of box, thirteen or four|teen feet high. The air round Padua is accounted very healthful; but its territory is &s;aid to be &s;ub|ject to violent &s;torms, particularly from the &s;ea. Mr. Key&s;ler tells us, that hou&s;es for the donne li|bere or donne del mondo, are publicly tolerated at Padua; that it is the particular province of cer|tain phy&s;icians to vi&s;it them frequently; and, what is a little odd, that one of them joins to the convent of the Eremitical fathers, and another to a nun|nery of St. Blaze. The Jews have a particular quarter allotted them in this city. They ridicu|lou&s;ly pretend to &s;hew here the tomb of antenor, the Trojan hero. The palace of the capitaneo or governor is a grand &s;tructure, and &s;tands in a fine &s;quare. They make no difficulty here of burying a prote&s;tant in a church or convent, if his name has been entered in the univer&s;ity matricula, before he died. The Benedictine convent has an income of an hundred thou&s;and ducats, and the cathedral of an hundred thou&s;and &s;cudi, per annum.</P>

<HEAD>The VERONESE or TERRITORY of VERONA.</HEAD>
<P>This is a very fertile &s;pot, yielding a profu&s;ion of corn, wine, oil, and fine fruits, with marble, petre|factions, valuable plants, rich pa&s;tures, great num|bers of fine cattle, and a variety of fi&s;h. In this
<PB N="394" REF="4010">
di&s;trict lies the Lago di Garda, which was antient|ly called Benacus, of which &s;ome geographers make the length thirty, and &s;ome forty miles; and the breadth, &s;ome thirty-&s;ix, others much le&s;s. The mo&s;t remarkable places in the Verone&s;e are,</P>
<P>Verona, which gives name to it, and is its capital, being a very large city, fortified in the antient manner, and delightfully &s;ituated on the Adige, in a &s;erene and healthy air, forty-nine miles we&s;t of Venice. Over the river are four bridges, of which that which leads to the ca&s;tle is much admired. The city looks much better at a di&s;tance, than when one is in it; the &s;treets being generally narrow, crooked, and dirty, and the hou&s;es meanly built. Here are three old ca&s;tles, viz. II Ca&s;tello Vecchio, St. Pietro, and St. Felice. The number of the in|habitants is reckoned at about fifty thou&s;and. The be&s;t &s;treet in the city is that called the Cor&s;o, where hor&s;e and foot races are &s;ometimes run. The large&s;t &s;quare is that called Piazza d'Armi, where the an|nual fairs were formerly kept, in April and Au|tumn. The Scaliger family were formerly lords of Verona; and in the church of St. Maria Antica are &s;ome monuments of the family, with their arms. In the town-hou&s;e are the &s;tatues of five ce|lebrated per&s;ons, natives of Verona, viz. the poets Catullus and Aemilius Marcus, the hi&s;torian Cor|nelius Nepos, Pliny the elder, and Vetruvius the architect. This city hath given birth to many other famous per&s;ons, among which are Ve&s;pa&s;ian, Titus, Domitian, Fraco&s;tar, Pomponius Secundus, Peter Martyr, Paul Verone&s;e an eminent painter, and cardinal Henry Norris. Among the private build|ings the fine&s;t is the palace of count Maffei; next to which are tho&s;e of count Bevilaqua, Cano&s;&s;a, Sig|niori Verzi, Pompeii, and Pellegrini. Here are &s;e|veral academies or &s;ocieties, as the Philharmonci, for the improvement of mu&s;ic; and the Philoti, for the improvement of the genteel exerci&s;es of
<PB N="395" REF="4020">
riding, fencing, vaulting, dancing, &amp;c. Here is al&s;o an elegant theatre for operas and comedies. Among the churches at Verona, that of St. George is the hand&s;ome&s;t. The dome or cathedral is an old building, in which is the tomb of pope Lucius, and a monument erected to one of the bi&s;hops, the epitaph on which &s;ays, that there was betwixt him and his Maker, &s;umma nece&s;&s;itudo, &s;umma &s;imili|tudo. Among other antiquities here, is the cele|brated amphitheatre, which, by the commendable care and attention of the inhabitants, has been pre|&s;erved in good condition, and pretty entire, thro' a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of &s;o many centuries, being le&s;s than that of Ve&s;pa&s;ian at Rome, but more perfect. It is not known when, or by whom, it was erected; tho' it mu&s;t have been &s;oon after the Augu&s;tine age. It is computed, that it would have conveniently held upwards of twenty thou&s;and &s;pectators. Near the city is a fine plain, where the mu&s;ters and mili|tary exerci&s;es are performed, and annual fairs kept. Verona is the &s;ee of a bi&s;hop, who&s;e revenue a|mounts to between four and five thou&s;and crowns. There are &s;everal admirable collections of antiqui|ties and curio&s;ities in Verona, which a &s;tranger may ea&s;ily obtain a &s;ight of. The principal com|modities exported from hence are medicinal herbs, gathered on Monte Balbo, oil, olives, of which tho&s;e of this neighbourhood are accounted excellent, &s;ome wine, and linen, woollen, and &s;ilk manufac|tures. There is a very commodious water-carriage for goods, from hence to Venice, down the Adige.</P>
<P>Garda, a ca&s;tle on the lake to which it gives name, about &s;ixteen miles from Verona. The lake is about thirty miles in length, and near ten where broade&s;t, and is &s;urrounded on all &s;ides with olive, fig, lemon, orange, and other fruit trees; but, at &s;ome &s;ea&s;ons, is much agitated by &s;torms.</P>

<HEAD>The VICENTINE.</HEAD>
<P>This territory hath its name from its capital, the antient city of Vicentia, now Vicenza. The &s;oil here is rich and fertile, no di&s;trict in Italy being better watered, and the air &s;erene and healthy. Its length is about forty miles, and its breadth about thirty three. The wines of this di&s;trict are much admired. In the hills are found &s;ilver and iron ore, and fine quarries of &s;tone. Here are al&s;o fine pa&s;ture-grounds and corn-fields, with plenty of fi&s;h, game, cattle, and mulberry trees, and a fine &s;ort of chalk for &s;couring cloaths and plate, and the &s;and from which they make Venice gla&s;s. The places of mo&s;t note in this di&s;trict are,</P>
<P>Vicenza, a pretty large city, at the confluence of the Bachiglioni, and Verone, about twenty-nine miles we&s;t of Venice. It is about four miles in circuit, and its inhabitants are computed at a|bout thirty thou&s;and. Formerly it had &s;trong walls, but the&s;e are now neglected and decayed. Over the principal river are &s;everal bridges, and without the city is a triumphal arch, built from a de&s;ign of Palladio, in imitation of the antient &s;tructures of that kind. There are a great many elegant buildings within it, particularly in the piazza before the council-hou&s;e; for be&s;ides the cathedral and other churches, and the convents, which are numerous, there are &s;everal ho&s;pitals, and &s;ome fine palaces. The wine of Vicenza is highly cele|brated, as it may be drank, during the pains of the gout, without the lea&s;t inconvenience, and the territory belonging to it, on account of its ferti|lity, is called the garden and &s;hambles of Venice. In the neighbourhood is a very fine garden belong|ing to count Valmarano, in which is a covered walk of cedar and orange-trees, and by the &s;ide

of it, a broad canal well &s;tocked with barbels, and other fi&s;h, which, at the &s;ound of a pipe ap|pear on the &s;urface of the water, to be fed. The inhabitants of this city are &s;aid to be more vindic|tive than the other Italians; whence they have got the name Gli A&s;&s;a&s;&s;ini Vicentini, or A&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins of Vicenza. The celebrated architect Andrea Pal|ladio, was born here. The academy of the Olym|pici, who&s;e principal de&s;ign is to improve the elegance of the Italian language, hold their meet|ings in a mo&s;t beautiful theatre, built by the ce|lebrated architect Andrea Palladio. From the church della Madonna di Monte without the city, is a mo&s;t charming pro&s;pect, both of the city and neighbouring country. The council-hou&s;e is a &s;tately fabric, and &s;o is the Monte della Pieta. In the latter is a fine library. Some remains of a Roman amphitheatre, of a noble aqueduct, and &s;ome mag|nificent hot baths are &s;till to be &s;een here. In the neighbourhood of the city, is the &s;plendid &s;eat of count Tri&s;&s;ino, and, as it is &s;aid, a grotto called II Cubalo, cut into the &s;olid rock, which is large and intricate, and even in the warme&s;t day of &s;um|mer, exceeding cold. Some &s;prings here too, we are told, petrify every thing that is thrown into them, and yet have living fi&s;h in them.</P>

They make here al&s;o linen cloth, and deal in many other kinds of merchandize. The ca&s;tle &s;tands on a rock, and commands the whole town, and the ar&s;enal is well furni&s;hed with war|like &s;tores. There is a great number of con|vents and churches here, be&s;ides the cathedral, which is a &s;tately modern &s;tructure. The bi&s;hop, who takes the titles of duke, marquis, and count, is &s;uffragan to the archbi&s;hop of Milan, and has a large income.

is exceeding fertile, and populous. The inhabi|tants, who are &s;aid to amount to upwards of one hundred and twenty thou&s;and, are very in|du&s;trious, and very jealous of the Tu&s;cans, by whom they are almo&s;t &s;urrounded. The forces of the republic amount, in time of peace, to about &s;ix hundred men, including the doge or gon&s;aloniers guard of Switzers, which con&s;i&s;ts of &s;eventy-&s;ix men; but there are above thirty thou&s;and men in the territory of Lucca capable of bearing arms. The government is ve&s;ted in two councils, of which one is called the council of &s;tate, and the other the great council, the executive power being in the former, con&s;i&s;ting of nine members be&s;ides the doge, who continue in office only two months, and during that time, have apartments in the pa|lace of the republic, and are maintained at the public expence. The great council con&s;i&s;ts of two hundred and thirty nobles, and ten burghers, who enjoy their office two years. The title of the doge is, Excellenza, and of the &s;tate, La Sereni&s;&s;ima Re|publica di Lucca. The annual revenue amounts to about four hundred thou&s;and &s;cudi, or eighty thou&s;and pounds &s;terling. Lucca the capital and the only place in the republic's territory worth de|&s;cribing, is about three Italian miles in circumfe|rence, and well fortified. The walls afford very plea&s;ant walks, being planted with rows of trees. The number of the inhabitants is about forty thou&s;and. The hou&s;es are generally well built, and the &s;treets broad and well paved, but irregu|lar. Several manufactures, particularly of &s;ilk are carried on, and the fine&s;t oil of any in Italy is &s;aid to be made here. Here al&s;o is the &s;ee of a bi|&s;hop.

Pope Pius V. conferred the title of grand-duke on Co&s;mo de Medicis, anno 1570, in who&s;e family the duchy continued until the death of Ga&s;ton de Medicis, who died without i&s;&s;ue, anno 1737. The duchy was then transferred to the duke of Lorrain, the late emperor, in lieu of the duchy of Lorrain, which, by the peace of 1736, was given to king Stani&s;laus, during his life, and then was to be an|nexed to France. The pre&s;ent grand-duke is the &s;econd &s;on of the late emperor Francis, and brother to the pre&s;ent. He is married to a daughter of Spain, and re&s;ides at Florence. His annual reve|nues are computed at above five hundred thou&s;and pounds &s;terling, ari&s;ing chiefly from the tenths of all e&s;tates, that are &s;old or alienated, and the ground-rents of the hou&s;es in Leghorn, and the duties on almo&s;t all manner of provi&s;ions.</P>
<P>The great duke is ab&s;olute in his dominions. His &s;tanding forces con&s;i&s;t only of three regi|ments of foot, and two of dragoons, and his ma|rine of a few gallies and galea&s;&s;es; but, in ca&s;e of nece&s;&s;ity, it is &s;aid, he can bring thirty thou&s;and men into the field, and increa&s;e his marine with twenty men of war; but it does not appear, how he could man them.</P>

We &s;hall give an account of the trade of the duchy in our de&s;cription of the towns, e&s;pecially of Leghorn.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the money of the grand duchy, twelve denaris make a &s;oldo; twenty &s;oldi, a &s;cudo; one hundred and fifty &s;oldi or &s;even and a half &s;cudi, or liras, make a &s;cudo d'oro, which is an imaginary coin; two liras, or three giuli are equal to a te&s;ton; &s;ix liras to a piece of eight; &s;e|ven liras, or ten and one half giuli, to a ducat or &s;ilver crown; twenty liras or thirty giuli to an Italian pi&s;tole; twenty liras and about four &s;oldi, or between thirty and thirty-one giuli, to a Spani&s;h pi&s;tole. In paying cu&s;tom, a piece of eight is va|lued only at one hundred and fifteen &s;oldi, or five liras and three quarters.</P>
<P>The only order of knighthood in this &s;tate is that of St. Stephen, in&s;tituted in 1554, by Co&s;|mo I. which con&s;i&s;ts of three cla&s;&s;es, namely the Cavalieri della Gui&s;titia, della Gratia, and de Commenderie. The duke is always grand-ma&s;ter, and the badge of the order, an octangular red cro&s;s, with a golden border, worn on the brea&s;t. The principal places in the duchy are,</P>
<P>Florence, the capital, &s;ituated on the river Arno, about fifty miles &s;outh of Bologna, &s;ixty &s;outh-ea&s;t of Modena, &s;eventy eight from Parma, one hundred and five from Mantua, a hun|dred and twenty-&s;ix &s;outh of Venice, and one hundred and twenty north-we&s;t of Rome. It is &s;aid to have been at fir&s;t called Fluentia, which was afterwards altered to Florentia, on account either of its flouri&s;hing &s;tate, or fertile &s;oil. The Italians now call it Fiorenza. It gives name to a di&s;trict, which is extremely well peopled, fertile, and beautiful. Over the Arno are four &s;tone bridges. The number of churches, convents, ho&s;pitals, and palaces is very great. The &s;treets are mo&s;tly crooked and narrow, but
<PB N="407" REF="4140">
clean, and paved with greyi&s;h &s;tone dug in the neighbouring mountains. To de&s;cribe all the cu|rio&s;ities in this city, e&s;pecially in the old and new ducal palaces, would take up a volume. It is enough to &s;ay, that they contain the riche&s;t col|lection of all manner of rarities, both of art and nature, antient and modern, that is, perhaps, in the whole world. The palaces here are &s;aid to be inferior to tho&s;e of Turin, Genoa, and Rome; and paper windows very common. The number of the inhabitants is computed at &s;eventy thou&s;and. Here is an academy for the improvement of the Tu&s;can language, called della Cru&s;ca, another for agriculture, and another for riding. The principal trade here, be&s;ides wine, oil, fruits, and other produce of the country, con&s;i&s;ts in wrought &s;ilks, gold and &s;ilver-&s;tuffs. The nobility and gentry do not think it below them to trade; they even &s;ell their wine by retail out of doors, but not in their hou&s;es: at the &s;ame time they look upon it as a great di&s;paragement, to educate their chil|dren in the profe&s;&s;ion of phy&s;ic. They write the Italian here very well, but their pronunciation is guttural, and di&s;agreeable. Florence is adorned, we are told, with &s;even fountains, &s;ix columns, two pyramids, and about an hundred and &s;ixty public &s;tatues. Mo&s;t of the Florentines are &s;aid to be &s;hort-&s;ighted, and hence the Fiorentini ciechi, or blind Florentines, has pa&s;&s;ed into a pro|verbial je&s;t. As the Tu&s;can order, and ru&s;tic work owe their orgin to this country, the archi|tects take care to give them a place in all the &s;truc|tures they rear in this duchy. The great piazza or &s;quare is very &s;pacious and magnificent, with a noble fountain in the mid&s;t of it. The ar&s;enal is well worth a traveller's notice, being a &s;tately building, and well furni&s;hed with all &s;orts of weapons of war, kept in very good order. The cathedral is a very magnificent edifice, the whole out&s;ide being of
<PB N="408" REF="4150">
poli&s;hed marble, and enriched with the mo&s;t ex|qui&s;ite architecture and &s;culpture; and from the ball over the cupola, you have a mo&s;t delightful pro&s;pect of all the churches, palaces, mona&s;te|ries, &amp;c. within the walls, and of near two thou|&s;and villas, or country &s;eats, without Hard by the church &s;tands the much celebrated Campanile, or &s;quare &s;teeple, which is one hundred and eighty feet high, all of fine marble, of &s;everal colours, and curiou&s;ly wrought. From the top of this tower you have much the &s;ame pro&s;pect as from the cupola of the church. The bapti&s;try, or font, where all the children of the city are baptized, is al&s;o well worth the attenuon of a traveller. Of the other churches we have not room to &s;ay any thing more, than that they are in general beauti|ful, and contain many fine paintings, and other pieces of art. Be&s;ide the two grand palaces men|tioned above, the duke hath &s;everal noble country &s;eats, enriched and adorned in the &s;ame magnifi|cent manner. The phy&s;ic-garden belonging to the great duke is well &s;tocked with the mo&s;t curious and rare plants; and in the &s;eraglio de Leoni, are kept all kinds of wild bea&s;ts. When the chapel for the interment of the great dukes, in the church of St. Lorenzo, is fini&s;hed, there will not be its equal in the whole world. Near the ducal gallery of curio&s;ities, is the ducal chymical laboratory. The quarter where the Jews live is called II Ghetto, and in the Mercato Nuovo is the exchange. This city is not fortified; but on the &s;ide of the river Arno it has a good citadel, called St. Giovanni. In the road leading from Florence to Sienna, are &s;till vi&s;ible many remains of the antient Via Ca&s;&s;ia.</P>
<P>Arezzo, formerly Aretium, and one of the twelve antient cities of Etruria. It is now the &s;ee of a bi&s;hop, and &s;tands forty miles &s;outh ea&s;t from Florence. Pope Gregory X. lies buried in the ca|thedral.

<P>Pi&s;toia, a large town on the river Stella, but very thinly inhabited, about twenty miles from Florence. Its name in the Itinerary is Ad Pi&s;tores. Formerly it was a di&s;tinct &s;tate. Here the famous, or rather infamous, Cataline was defeated; and in latter times the factions of the Guelphs and Gibel|lines rendered it remarkable. The water-melons here are &s;aid to be very fine. In the neighbouring country the cattle are all perfectly white.</P>
<P>Pi&s;a, a large town on the Arno, fifty-two miles from Florence. It was a famous republic, till &s;ubdued, fir&s;t by the duke of Milan, and then by the Florentines, in the year 1406. Before it lo&s;t its freedom, it is &s;aid to have contained near one hundred and fifty thou&s;and inhabitants, but now has not above &s;ixteen or &s;eventeen thou&s;and. Its territory is very fruitful, abounding in corn, wine, fruit, and fine cattle. The hou&s;es are well built, and the &s;treets even, broad, and well paved; but in many places over run with gra&s;s. The univer|&s;ity is well endowed, and has able profe&s;&s;ors, but is not in a very flouri&s;hing condition. The exchange is a &s;tately &s;tructure, but little frequented. The
<PB N="410" REF="4170">
great duke's gallies are built, and commonly &s;ta|tioned here. This city is al&s;o the principal re&s;i|dence of the order of St. Stephen, and the &s;ee of an archbi&s;hop. The cathedral, a large Gothic pile, contains a great number of excellent paintings, and other curio&s;ities. The echo of the Bapti&s;tery is &s;aid to exceed that near Milan, though the re|petitions are not quite &s;o di&s;tinct. Hard by the ca|thedral is the city burying ground, called II Campo Santo, and in that the famous leaning tower, the inclination of which is &s;o great, that a plumb line let down from the top touches the ground at the di&s;tance of near fifteen &s;eet from the bottom. In the church della Spina, they pretend to have one of the thorns of the crown that was placed on our Saviour's head. The city for its defence has a moat, walls, a ca&s;tle, fort, and citadel; the la&s;t of which is a modern work. The Arno is of a con&s;iderable breadth here, and has three bridges over it, one of them of marble: two leagues be|low the town it falls into the &s;ea. The phy&s;ic gar|den is very &s;pacious, contains a great number of plants, and is decorated with water-works: over the door leading into it are the&s;e words, <HI>Hic Argus &s;ed nos Briareus e&s;to;</HI> i. e. Employ the eyes of Ar|gus, but not the hands of Briareus. The air is &s;aid to be unwhole&s;ome here in &s;ummer, on ac|count of the neighbouring mora&s;&s;es. Many buf|faloes are bread in the neighbouring country, and their fle&s;h commonly eaten. A canal runs from this city to Leghorn; and between it and Lucca are hot baths.</P>
<P>Leghorn, antiently called Liburnus Portus, but by the modern Italians, Livorno, a hand&s;ome town, and a free port, about thirty miles &s;outh-we&s;t from Florence, in the territory of Pi&s;a. The only defect of the harbour is its being too &s;hallow for large &s;hips. Co&s;mo I. had this town, in exchange for Sar|zana,
<PB N="411" REF="4180">
from the Genoe&s;e, and it is the only &s;ea-port in the duchy. It was then but a mean unhealthy place, but is now very hand&s;ome, and well built, with broad, &s;trait, parallel &s;treets. It is al&s;o well fortified, but wants good water, which mu&s;t be brought from Pi&s;a. The port, con&s;i&s;ting of two havens, one for the duke's gallies, and the other for merchant &s;hips, is &s;urrounded with a double mole, above a mile and a half in length, and de|fended, together with the town, by a good cita|del, and twelve forts. Roman catholics, Jews, Greeks, Armenians, Mahometans, and even the Engli&s;h factory, are indulged in the public exer|ci&s;e of their religion; but other prote&s;tants mu&s;t be &s;atisfied with the private. The trade carried on here is very great, and mo&s;t of it pa&s;&s;es through the hands of the Jews. Though only two pia&s;tres, or &s;cudi, are paid for every bale, great or &s;mall, imported or exported, yet the duties on all provi|&s;ions and commodities brought from the continent to the town are very heavy. The number of the in|habitants is &s;aid to be about forty thou&s;and, and one half of the&s;e Jews, who live in a particular quarter, but without any mark of di&s;tinction, and have a fine &s;ynagogue. The walks on the ramparts are very a&gacute;reeable. There is good anchorage in the road, but &s;hips riding there are much expo&s;ed to the weather, and the Barbary cor&s;airs. The num|ber of Engli&s;h families in Leghorn are about thirty-&s;ix; they are much favoured by the government, and carry on a great trade. The power of the in|qui&s;ition is limited to eccle&s;ia&s;tical matters, and Roman catholics. There are a great many Turk|i&s;h &s;laves here, brought in by the duke's gallies, who are often &s;ent out on a cruize again&s;t the cor|&s;airs of Barbary. The light-hou&s;e &s;tands on a rock in the &s;ea, near which is the Lazaretto, where quarantine is performed. Another &s;ource, from
<PB N="412" REF="4190">
which the duke draws a great revenue, is the mo|nopoly of brandy, tobacco, and &s;alt; but that, with the heavy duties, makes provi&s;ions dear. The Turks, who are not &s;laves, live in a particular quarter, near that of the Jews. The common pro&s;titutes al&s;o have a particular place a&s;&s;igned them, out of which they mu&s;t not be &s;een, with|out leave from the commi&s;&s;ary. The number of the rowers in the gallies, whether Turki&s;h &s;laves, criminals, or volunteers, are about two thou&s;and. In the area before the dar&s;ena, or inner harbour, is a fine &s;tatue of duke Ferdinand, with four Turk|i&s;h &s;laves, in bronze, chained to the pede&s;tal. The ducal palace is one of the fine&s;t &s;tructures in the town, and the ordinary re&s;idence of the governor. Leghorn is the &s;ee of a bi&s;hop, and has a noble ca|thedral; but the other churches are not re|markable.</P>
<P>Volterra, formerly Volaterae, now a mean lone|ly place, though antiently one of the principal cities of Etruria. The air is &s;aid to be unwhole&s;ome.</P>
<P>Sienna, an antient and &s;till a pretty large city, thirty-eight miles &s;outh of Florence. It was for|merly the capital of a con&s;iderable republic, but was reduced by the emperor Charles V. who tran&s;|ferred it to his &s;on Philip II. of Spain, and he made over the whole, except the Stato de gli Pre|&s;idii, to Co&s;mo I. duke of Florence, in lieu of the debts he owed him. The territory to which this city gives name, is about &s;ixty-five miles from north to &s;outh, and near as many from ea&s;t to we&s;t, very fertile and plea&s;ant, well cultivated, and peo|pled. The city is very clean, neat, and healthy, but far from populous, &s;eventeen thou&s;and inhabi|tants being the mo&s;t it contains. The&s;e are &s;aid to be very polite, and of a lively di&s;po&s;ition, the wo|men beautiful, and under le&s;s re&s;traint than in other parts of Italy; hence, as it is imagined, it is
<PB N="413" REF="4200">
that the Italian language is &s;poken here in the greate&s;t purity. The walls are adorned with many high towers of brick, and the &s;treets paved with bricks &s;et edge-ways. Here is the &s;ee of an archbi&s;hop, and the cathedral is a very magnifi|cent Gothic pile, being very large, and covered with the fine&s;t marble, curiou&s;ly wrought both with|in and without; but what is particularly admired in this &s;tructure, is the pavement, which con&s;i&s;ts of the mo&s;t co&s;tly marble, curiou&s;ly inlaid with gems, &s;o as to repre&s;ent, in a mo&s;t ma&s;terly manner, the hi&s;tories of the Old Te&s;tament. This work, which is ju&s;tly e&s;teemed too fine to be trod upon, is cover|ed with boards; but the&s;e can be ea&s;ily removed to gratify the curio&s;ity of a &s;tranger. Among the relics here, are the right-arm of John the Bapti&s;t, and the &s;word with which Peter cut off the ear of Malchus. Directly under the cathedral lies St. John's church, the entrance to which is at the foot of the hill. One may look down into the latter through a grate in the pavement of the former. The arms of this city are Romulus and Remus &s;ucking a wolf, for it pretends to have been a co|lony founded by the&s;e two brothers. Near the &s;enate-hou&s;e is a tower, called La Mangiana, noted for its curious chimes, but they only play on &s;o|lemn occa&s;ions. In the &s;quare before the &s;enate-hou&s;e is a marble fountain, finely executed. Charles V. founded an academy here, which, at pre&s;ent, is in a declining condition. Here al&s;o is a ca&s;tle, but it was never a place of much &s;trength; and near it is a riding-&s;chool. Fronting the cathedral is a &s;pacious and well-endowed ho&s;pital, founded by a &s;hoe-maker, who is interred in the church, and, as a reward for his liberality, hath been canoniz|ed. Over the &s;tatue erected to his memory is this appo&s;ite in&s;cription, <HI>Sutor ultra crepidam;</HI> i. e. The &s;hoe-maker went beyond his la&s;t. The Je|&s;uits

church here is very fine, and in that of the Dominicans is the head of St. Catherine of Sienna. The&s;e Dominicans gravely tell us, they have in their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion the wedding ring which our Saviour gave St. Catharine, at the &s;olemnization of their marriage, which, according to them, was performed with the utmo&s;t magnificence, king David a&s;&s;i&s;ting, and playing on his harp. In the hou&s;e where &s;he re&s;ided at Sienna, they &s;hew the window, through which, they pretend, Chri&s;t u&s;ed often to come and vi&s;it her. In the garden belonging to the Franci&s;can convent, is a kind of ever-green oak, called Leccio, &s;aid to have derived its origin from the &s;taff of St. Francis, which was here &s;tuck into the ground.</P>
<P>Chiu&s;i, antiently Clu&s;ium, one of the chief cities of Etruria, and the re&s;idence of Por&s;enna, the famed king thereof.

<P>Orbitello, a fortified town, on a lake, formed by an arm of the &s;ea, thirty-eight miles from Sienna to the &s;outh-we&s;t. It is the capital of the Stato de gli Pre&s;idii, which, as we ob&s;erved already, was re&s;erved, when Philip II. of Spain made over the di&s;trict of Sienna to Co&s;mo I. but, in 1707, the Imperiali&s;ts made a conque&s;t of it; and, in 1735, it was transferred to don Carlos, then king of both Sicilies, who&s;e &s;on is now in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it, as king of the Two Sicilies. Orbitello is &s;aid to have ri&s;en out of the ruins of the antient Co&s;o, now a heap of ruins at a &s;mall di&s;tance from it.</P>
<P>Piombino, a &s;mall town on a rock in the &s;ea, forty-&s;ix miles &s;outh-ea&s;t of Leghorn. It ro&s;e from the ruins of the antient city Populonia, has a

citadel and ca&s;tle, and gives name to a &s;mall prin|cipality, belonging to the dukes of Sora, in the kingdom of Naples. Oppo&s;ite to this principality lies the little i&s;le of Elba, which is &s;eparated from the continent by a channel ten miles in length, and is mountainous; but its mountains afford iron, lead, and &s;ulphur. It con&s;titutes a part of the prin|cipality of Piombino, and has the &s;ame proprietor, except Porto Ferraio, which belongs to the duke of Tu&s;cany, and Porto Longone, where the king of the Two Sicilies has a garri&s;on.</P>

<P>The &s;oil, in general, of the pope's dominions is very fertile, but ill cultivated; and there are many fens and mar&s;hy grounds, which are very prejudi|cial to the air. That the lands are badly culti|vated and inhabited, the air bad, and the inhabi|tants poor, idle, lazy, and gro&s;ly &s;uper&s;titious, is owing to their being governed by prie&s;ts, who may be ju&s;tly &s;aid not only to fleece them, but flea them. But it will, perhaps, be &s;aid, that though they &s;hew little or no concern about their temporal welfare, they take care of their &s;ouls. If teaching them the mo&s;t ridiculous and ab&s;urd &s;uper&s;tition, to pray to &s;aints and angels, and wor&s;hip images, in&s;tead of God and Chri&s;t; to place religion in farce and mummery; in in&s;ignificant rites and forms; in
<PB N="416" REF="4230">
pilgrimages; in a profound veneration for the clergy; in offerings to the church; in founding and endowing convents; in hating and per&s;ecuting prote&s;tants, even more than Jews or Turks; in believing, as articles of faith, the mo&s;t impious and irrational notions: if this is taking care of their &s;ouls, and conducting them to heaven, we own the prie&s;ts who govern this, and other popi&s;h countries, cannot, in the lea&s;t, be charged with want of zeal or diligence. Be that as it will, this country, with re&s;pect to the accommodations of this life, is but in a very indifferent condition; for, notwith&s;tanding the fertility of its &s;oil, its advan|tageous &s;ituation for traffic, the large &s;ums &s;pent in it by travellers, or remitted to it from foreign countries, and its having, for its ruler, the &s;ucce&s;&s;or of St. Peter, the prince of the apo&s;tles, and the vi|car of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, yet it is poor and thin of inha|bitants, ill cultivated, and without trade and manu|factures. This is partly owing to the great number of holidays, of &s;turdy beggars, called pilgrims, and of ho&s;pitals and convents, with the amazing but u&s;e|le&s;s wealth of churches and convents, and the in|qui&s;ition; but the chief cau&s;e is the &s;everity of the government, and the grievous exactions and hard|&s;hips to which the &s;ubjects are expo&s;ed. The le|gates, tho' mo&s;tly clergymen, who&s;e thoughts &s;hould be chiefly employed about laying up trea&s;ures in heaven, and who ought to &s;et an example to the laity of di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s, and a contempt of this world, yet, in fact, &s;cruple no kind of rapaciou&s;ne&s;s: even the holy father him&s;elf, and the cardinals, make the enriching of their nephews and other re|lations, and the aggrandizing their families, the great bu&s;ine&s;s of their lives. The extravagant claims and preten&s;ions of the pope are well known, and, by all the rational part of Chri&s;tendom, now treated with contempt and mockery: the Reforma|tion
<PB N="417" REF="4240">
gave a great blow to his &s;piritual power, but as to his temporal dominions, he &s;till po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es them entire; though it is not likely that that will long be the ca&s;e, con&s;idering how much he hath lo&s;t, and is daily lo&s;ing of his gho&s;tly empire, and the venera|tion in which he was formerly held. The Je&s;uits, who may ju&s;tly be regarded as one of the main pillars of popery, have been already expelled from &s;everal of the mo&s;t bigotted Roman catholic coun|tries; and it is more than probable, the holy father, though it mu&s;t be like the cutting off a right hand to him, will &s;oon be obliged entirely to &s;uppre&s;s them. The papal dominions were originally pro|cured, partly by the voluntary gift of bigotted princes, and partly by other methods. The Cam|pania of Rome is under the pope's immediate go|vernment; but the other provinces are governed by legates and vice-legates; and there is a commander in chief of the pope's forces in every province. The pope is cho&s;en by the cardinals in the conclave, who are &s;eventy in number when com|plete, and con&s;i&s;t of three cla&s;&s;es, namely, car|dinal-bi&s;hops, prie&s;ts, and deacons: they look upon them&s;elves as on a footing with crowned heads, and have the title of eminenti&s;&s;imi. The pope holds a con&s;i&s;tory of cardinals on eccle&s;ia&s;tical affairs; but the cardinals do not meddle with his civil government. The pope's chief mini&s;ter is the cardinal-patron, u&s;ually his nephew, who ama&s;&s;es an immen&s;e e&s;tate, if the reign be of any long du|ration. The cardinal that is cho&s;en pope mu&s;t be an Italian, and at lea&s;t fifty-five years of age. Car|dinal Ganganelli, who was lately advanced to the pon|tificate, is &s;aid to be a native of the di&s;trict of Rimini, a man of parts and learning, and turned of &s;ixty. He hath a&s;&s;umed the title of Clement XIV. and &s;eems di&s;|po&s;ed to li&s;ten to the demands of the hou&s;e of Bour|bon, with re&s;pect to the Je&s;uits. The &s;piritual power of the pope, though far &s;hort of what it was before

the Reformation, is &s;till con&s;iderable. It is com|puted that the monks and regular clergy, who are ab&s;olutely at his devotion, do not amount to le&s;s than two millions of people, di&s;per&s;ed through all the Roman catholic countries, to a&s;&s;ert his &s;upre|macy over princes, and promote the intere&s;t of the church. The revenues of the&s;e monks do not fall &s;hort of twenty millions &s;terling, be&s;ides the ca&s;ual profits ari&s;ing from offerings, and the people's bounty to the church, who are taught that their &s;al|vation depends on this kind of benevolence.</P>
<P>The pope's revenues, as a temporal prince, may amount to about a million &s;terling per annum, ari&s;ing chiefly from the monopoly of corn, the du|ties on wine, and other provi&s;ions. Over and above the&s;e, va&s;t &s;ums are continually flowing into the papal trea&s;ury from all the Roman catholic countries, for di&s;pen&s;ations, indulgences, canoniza|tions, annates, the pallia, and inve&s;titures of archbi|&s;hops, bi&s;hops, &amp;c.</P>
<P>The pope has a con&s;iderable body of regular forces, well cloathed and paid; but his fleet con|&s;i&s;ts only of a few gallies. His life-guards are forty Switzers, &s;eventy-five cuira&s;&s;iers, and as ma|ny light-hor&s;e.</P>
<P>As to the Roman coins, five quatrini make one bajocho; ten bajochi make one guilo, or paolo; ten guili make one &s;cudonionito or curr, which is about four &s;hillings and four pence &s;terling; thirty-two guili, or paoli, make a Spani&s;h pi&s;tole, and thirty-one an Italian pi&s;tole; &s;even quatrini make a gazetta; and &s;even gazetta and one qua|trino make a paolo.</P>

<HEAD>The BOLOGNESE, or TERRITORY of BOLOGNA.</HEAD>
<P>This county was once a republic; but the popes, at la&s;t, found means to annex it to their dominions. It &s;till, however, enjoys many privileges. Its chief governor, who is changed or confirmed every three years, has the title of legate a latere, and is always a cardinal. The &s;oil here is very rich and fertile; but not &s;o well cultivated or peopled as might be ex|pected. The only place of any note in it is</P>
<P>Bologna, which gives name to it, and is its capi|tal. This city was antiently called Fel&s;ina, and is now the &s;econd in the Eccle&s;ia&s;tical State, and one of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable in Italy, the number of its inhabitants being reckoned at upwards of eighty thou&s;and. It hath been the &s;eat of an archbi&s;hop ever &s;ince the year 1518. The &s;mall river Reno runs through it, and the Savona, which is larger, by its walls: the former has a communication with the Po, by a canal, which is very advantageous to the city. The manufactures here are chiefly wrought &s;ilks of all &s;orts, rich velvets, leather bottles, per|fumes, &s;weetmeats, wa&s;hballs, &amp;c. of which, and to|bacco, hemp, flax, hams, olives, and other fruits, they vend large quantities. The only fortification of the city is a &s;trong high brick wall, adorned with a great number of towers, at certain di&s;tances; for when the city &s;ubmitted to the pope, it was &s;tipu|lated, that there &s;hould be no citadel or garri&s;on kept to bridle it; that it &s;hould be allowed to &s;end an envoy to Rome, and to have an a&s;&s;e&s;&s;or in the rota; and, that the effects of the citizens &s;hould, on no pretence what&s;oever, be &s;ubject to confi&s;ca|tion. The nuns here are very ingenious in making artificial flowers, and imitating all kinds of fruits: very beautiful works are al&s;o made of walnut-tree,
<PB N="420" REF="4270">
and rock-cry&s;tal. There is but a &s;mall demand now for the little dogs of this city, &s;o that the breed is become very &s;carce. The theriaca prepared here, at the public elaboratory, and the electuario de Martino are highly e&s;teemed, as antidotes again&s;t the effects of poi&s;on. All kinds of provi&s;ions are in great plenty, and the inns the be&s;t in Italy. The Bologna &s;au&s;ages, and dried tongues, are well known, and much valued every where. The wo|men enjoy as much liberty here as in any city of Italy: tho&s;e of the highe&s;t rank dre&s;s entirely after the French mode. Mr. Key&s;ler &s;ays, that the num|ber of blind people in this city is remarkable; and that of tho&s;e that &s;ee, many wear &s;pectacles in the &s;treets, as an infallible mark of gravity and wi&s;dom; yet the inhabitants are generally reckoned very fa|cetious, and much addicted to &s;atire and raillery: at the &s;ame time, they are very polite to &s;trangers. In the centre of the city, like a ma&s;t in a &s;hip, &s;tands a very high tower, called Degli A&s;inelli, from Gerardo A&s;inelli, who built it, in 1109: the height is three hundred and &s;eventy-one feet. Near it is a leaning-tower, called Gari&s;enda, but not &s;o high as the other. The palace, where the governor re|&s;ides and the courts of ju&s;tice are held, &s;tands in the great market-place, and is two hundred and eight common paces in length. There are a great many convents, fine palaces, and churches, in Bologna, adorned with a great variety of fine paint|ings, &s;culptures, &amp;c. Of the churches, that of St. Petronius is the large&s;t, in which the emperor Charles V. was crowned, in the year 1530: the greate&s;t curio&s;ity in this church is the meridian line, drawn by the celebrated a&s;tronomer Ca&s;&s;ini, con|&s;i&s;ting of bra&s;s, inlaid in white marble, on the pave|ment, about an inch broad, and an hundred and eight feet in length; the rays of the &s;un enter, through a &s;mall aperture in the roof of the church, and &s;hew, every day, when the &s;un is in the me|ridian,

and al&s;o his place in the ecliptic. In the ve&s;try of the Dominican church is a manu&s;cript of the Old Te&s;tament, or at lea&s;t of the Penta|teuch, of great antiquity, written, as &s;ome pretend, by the hand of Ezra; and in a chapel of the &s;ame convent is a piece of painting, which repre|&s;ents an angel going up a ladder, with the great St. Dominic the na&s;ty on his back; Chri&s;t and the Virgin Mary appearing above, holding the ladder. Here is an univer&s;ity, &s;aid to have been founded by the emperor Theodo&s;ius, in the year 433. In 1712, an academy for the improve|ment of natural hi&s;tory, experimental philo&s;ophy, mathematics, chymi&s;try, anatomy, and phy&s;ic, was founded here by the count de Mar&s;igli, with which the Academia Clementina bonarum Artium, founded by pope Clement XI. for the improvement of archi|tecture, &s;culpture, and painting, was afterwards in|corporated: in this college is a very fine collection of curio&s;ities, both of nature and art. In the Al|drovandi mu&s;eum, kept in the Sala Farne&s;e, are an hundred and eighty &s;even folios, and above two hundred bags full of &s;ingle leaves, all written by the hand of that eminent author. In the convent of the nuns of St. Clare, a kind of holy water is di&s;tributed to devout per&s;ons, &s;aid to contain a par|ticular virtue, from having been u&s;ed to wa&s;h the body of St. Catharine de Vigri, which is pre&s;erved in the convent, and looks like a dried mummy: this &s;aint was the foundre&s;s of the convent. Again&s;t the wall of one of the halls of the public academy is the tomb of the famous Taliacotius or Taglicoz|zo, celebrated in the poem of Hudibras for &s;up|plying people with no&s;es taken from porters po&s;te|riors, but, in his epitaph, for his great &s;kill in phy|&s;ic. From Bologna runs a covered walk, to the nunnery of Madonna de St. Lucca, on the Monte della Guardia, three Italian miles from the city:
<PB N="422" REF="4290">
the picture of the Virgin in this nunnery, &s;aid to have been done by St. Luke, is brought every year to Bologna, in a &s;olemn proce&s;&s;ion, for the conve|nience of which the covered walk was erected. Near Bologna, and al&s;o in &s;ome other parts of Italy, is found a &s;tone about the &s;ize of a walnut, u&s;ually called Bononia &s;tone, which, after a particular cal|cination, imbibes, by being expo&s;ed a few minutes to the &s;un, &s;uch a quantity of light that it afterwards &s;hines in the dark near fifteen minutes, like a can|dle; but without any &s;en&s;ible heat: it retains its lu&s;tre even tho' immer&s;ed in water, and pre&s;erves this quality three or four years; but, after that, mu&s;t be calcined anew.

<P>The duchy of Ferrara had formerly dukes of its own; but, in the year 1597, it was annexed to the Eccle&s;ia&s;tical State. The dukes of Modena have often laid claim to it, being de&s;cended of the family of its antient dukes. The only place worth men|tioning in the duchy is that from which it takes its name, viz.</P>
<P>Ferrara, a very large town on the Po, but ex|tremely thin of people, &s;tanding twenty-three miles almo&s;t north-ea&s;t of Bologna, and an hundred and ninety north-we&s;t of Rome. Here is a citadel, and a huge ca&s;tle, in which the legate re&s;ides. The &s;treets are very beautiful, in re&s;pect of length, breadth, and regularity, and contain many hand|&s;ome hou&s;es and palaces. The other fortifications, be&s;ides the ca&s;tle and citadel, are of little impor|tance.

<HEAD>The PROVINCE of ROMAGNA.</HEAD>
<P>This country is very fertile and plea&s;ant, pro|ducing corn, wine, oil, fruits, rich pa&s;tures, woods abounding with game, and hot mineral waters. The mountains yield mines of &s;everal metals, and the &s;ea and rivers plenty of fi&s;h. Con&s;iderable quantities of &s;alt are made on the &s;ea-coa&s;t. After the declen&s;ion of the Roman empire, it was &s;ome time under the dominion of the O&s;trogoths; then of the Ea&s;tern emperors, who governed it by ex|archs; then of the Lombards, till Pepin king of France took it from them, and be&s;towed it on the &s;ee of Rome. The principal places in it are,</P>
<P>Ravenna, an old decayed city, thirty-eight miles ea&s;t of Bologna, and an hundred and &s;ixty north-we&s;t of Rome. Antiently, it was the mo&s;t famous of all the Roman &s;ea-ports, and afterwards the &s;eat of the exarchate. At pre&s;ent, it hardly contains fifteen thou&s;and inhabitants, yet there are no fewer than twenty-four convents in it. Here are &s;ome remains of the palace of Theodoric, king of the O&s;trogoths; and in the wall of the front, is his coffin of porphyry, which formerly &s;tood amid&s;t the &s;tatues of the twelve apo&s;tles, on the cupola of a
<PB N="424" REF="4310">
round chapel without the town, called the Ro|tunda, which is &s;aid to have been built by Amala|&s;unta, Theodoric's daughter, but is now going to ruin. In the time of the Romans, the city was &s;ur|rounded by the &s;ea, having no communication with the land but by a cau&s;e way; whereas, it is now three or four miles from the &s;ea. Some re|mains of the Roman pharos or lighthou&s;e are &s;till to be &s;een. The cupola of the above-mentioned chapel con&s;i&s;ts of one &s;tone, in form of an inverted di&s;h, an hundred and fourteen geometrical feet in circumference, four in thickne&s;s, and weighing near an hundred tons. In the walls of the city, towards the &s;ea, are &s;till to be &s;een the iron rings to which the &s;hips were fa&s;tened formerly, when the &s;ea flowed up &s;o high. In the large market-place are two lofty pillars of granate, on which are the &s;tatues of St. Victor and St. Apollinaris; and al&s;o a bra&s;s &s;tatue of pope Alexander VII. &s;itting, the u&s;ual attitude of the pope in all &s;tatues and public monuments. The cathedral is a &s;tately old fabric, adorned within with four rows of marble pillars, a roof of Mo&s;aic work, and a pavement of porphyry, of various co|lours. The church of St. Vitalis, and others, are al&s;o very beautiful. In the garden of the Benedic|tine convent is a fine chapel, built by Galla Placidia, daughter to Theodo&s;ius the Great, in which the remains of Placidia her&s;elf, and of Honorius, Con|&s;tantius, and Valentinian III. are pre&s;erved in three coffins of white marble. At one corner of the Franci&s;can convent, in the public &s;treet, is the mo|nument, with a bu&s;to of the celebrated Florentine poet Dante Alighieri, who was born in 1265, and died in 1321. His proper name was Durante, which, in his infancy, was contracted into Dante. His poems have rendered the names of Beatrix Portinaria, and Gentucca, immortal; as tho&s;e of Petrarch have that of Laura. About three or four

<P>Faenza, in Latin Faventia, a town on the river Amone, twenty-five miles &s;outh of Ravenna. It is noted for its fine earthen ware; no other part of Italy affording clay equal in goodne&s;s to that here. It is an epi&s;copal &s;ee, under the archbi&s;hop of Ra|venna. Over the river is a &s;tone bridge, and in the market-place a beautiful marble fountain. Here is al&s;o a linen manufacture.</P>
<P>Servia, a &s;mall but hand&s;ome town on the Adri|atic, about twelve miles &s;outh-ea&s;t of Ravenna. Before the year 1703, it &s;tood half an Italian mile farther from the &s;ea; but was then removed hither for the &s;ake of better air. It is the &s;ee of a bi&s;hop, &s;uffragan of Ravenna. Near it, in &s;ummer, a great deal of &s;alt is made of the &s;ea-water, con|veyed, by a canal, into a large hollow or re&s;er|voir.</P>

Behind the Capuchins convent are &s;ome remains of an amphitheatre, and over the Marecchia is a &s;tately bridge of marble, built or repaired by Augu&s;tus and Tiberius. In the middle of the area before the council-hou&s;e is an elegant fountain; and on both &s;ides of the church of St. Francis are &s;everal tombs of the Mala|te&s;tas, who were long lords of Rimini. The &s;plendid library of count Gabalonga is well worth a traveller's notice. Formerly there was an excel|lent harbour here, lined with marble; but it is now &s;o choaked up with &s;and, that it will hardly admit &s;mall boats.</P>
<P>Forli, a town on the river Montone, fifteen miles &s;outh of Ravenna, near which antiently &s;tood Forum Livii, whence the town took its name. It is the &s;ee of a bi&s;hop, and contains a great many churches and convents. Its terri|tory is extremely rich and fertile.</P>

<HEAD>The MARQUISATE of ANCONA.</HEAD>
<P>This marqui&s;ate lies on the Adriatic, and ex|tends from ea&s;t to we&s;t about twenty-four miles, and from &s;outh to north eighteen. The air is gro&s;s and unhealthy, but the &s;oil fertile. Wax and flax are &s;aid to be whitened and prepared here with great &s;kill. Along the coa&s;t are many towers,
<PB N="428" REF="4350">
mounted with cannon, to keep off the Cor&s;airs, and on the &s;hore are found a &s;ort of &s;hell-fi&s;h, called ballani, or ballari, in large &s;pungy &s;tones, of which &s;ome have little apertures on the &s;urface. Twenty or thirty of the&s;e fi&s;h are &s;ome times lodged in one &s;tone; but the ta&s;te of them is generally di&s;agreeable to &s;trangers. Both the fi&s;h it&s;elf and its juice are &s;o luminous in the dark, that one may &s;ee to read by them. Even the water, in which they have been &s;queezed, retains a lu&s;tre for ten or twelve hours. Great quantities of them are &s;ent to Rome. A variety of other &s;hell-fi&s;h are found upon the coa&s;t. From its being governed, in the time of the Longobards, by a margrave, this coun|try got the name of a marqui&s;ate. It fell under the dominion of the pope in the year 1532. The mo&s;t con&s;iderable places in it are,</P>
<P>Ancona, the capital, and the &s;ee of a bi&s;hop, immediately &s;ubject to the pope, &s;ituated on the Adriatic, about one hundred and thirty miles al|mo&s;t north from Rome. It is but a mean place, and is &s;aid to have had its name from the Greek word <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, &s;ignifying the elbow, as being built in an angle or corner. The harbour is large and good, but the traffic incon&s;iderable, as it is in mo&s;t of the papal dominions. Here are great numbers of Jews, who have a large &s;ynagogue, and live in a particular ward, being di&s;tingui&s;hed by a bit of red cloth in their hats. People al&s;o of all other per&s;ua&s;ions are tolerated, but not allowed the public exerci&s;e of their religion. The ex|change is a hand&s;ome building, and, near the har|bour, is a triumphal arch, erected by the Roman &s;enate, to the emperor Trajan, in gratitude for his improvement of the harbour. Though the town is fortified, and has a citadel, it is not capable of making any great defence. The harbour is &s;e|cured by a mole, on the head of which a few guns
<PB N="429" REF="4360">
are generally mounted. It is ob&s;erved, that the &s;tature and complexion of the inhabitants of Ancona, e&s;pecially of the fair &s;ex, and al&s;o of Senigallia, Fano, and Pe&s;aro, are &s;o greatly &s;upe|rior to the re&s;t of the inhabitants of Italy, that they &s;eem to be another people. The large laza|retto here &s;tands partly in the &s;ea, and partly on the &s;hore.</P>
<P>Loretto, a &s;mall city, fifteen miles &s;outh-ea&s;t of Ancona. It is the &s;ee of a bi&s;hop; but what renders it famous throughout Chri&s;tendom, is the &s;anta ca&s;a, or holy hou&s;e, in which, it is pretended, the Virgin Mary dwelt at Nazareth, and which towards the end of the thirteenth century, accord|ing to the legend, was conveyed hither by angels. This hou&s;e, which at different times has under|gone con&s;iderable alterations and repairs, is thirty-one feet three quarters in length, thirteen feet and three inches in breadth, and eighteen feet nine inches in height. There are three doors in it, two for the people, and a third for the clergy. What|ever the popi&s;h writers may pretend, it is built of a kind of bricks of unequal &s;ize. There is a &s;mall tower on it, in which are two &s;mall bells, rung only in violent &s;torms of thunder and lightning, from a per&s;ua&s;ion, that their &s;ound only will di&s;per&s;e any tempe&s;t, and prevent its ill effects. On the we&s;t &s;ide is the window through which the angel came into the hou&s;e. The place where the Virgin was &s;itting, when the angel came in, is &s;eparated from the re&s;t by a &s;ilver ba|lu&s;trade. The image of the Virgin, and the Di|vine Infant on her right arm, are of cedar; but their faces are much tarni&s;hed with the &s;moke of the lamps. Both of them are very richly dre&s;&s;ed, and loaded with gold chains, rings, and the mo&s;t co&s;tly jewels, having on their heads, triple crowns of gold, enriched with diamonds and pearls. To

give a particular detail of all the votive pieces and jewels, in the holy hou&s;e, and trea&s;ury, would fill a volume. Let it &s;uffice here to &s;ay, that they are of immen&s;e value, being the offerings of princes and prince&s;&s;es, and other great per&s;onages. Even the riches contained in the trea&s;ury are valued at nine millions of rix-dollars. Seventeen golden lamps are continually burning before the Virgin, and thirty-&s;even &s;ilver ones in the other parts of the hou&s;e. The pavement is of &s;quare pieces of red and white marble, and the whole hou&s;e is ca&s;ed on the out&s;ide, with the mo&s;t co&s;tly marble, adorned with &s;tatues, &s;culptures, and pillars of the Corinthian order; and over all is a fine &s;pacious church, to pre&s;erve it from the in|juries of wind and weather. Before the Reforma|tion, the number of pilgrims, who vi&s;ited the holy hou&s;e in a year, is &s;aid to have often amounted to two hundred thou&s;and; but now they &s;eldom exceed forty or fifty thou&s;and. They come mo&s;tly in &s;ummer, &s;ome on foot, others on a&s;&s;es or hor&s;es, and &s;ome in carriges. The poor pilgrims are re|ceived into an ho&s;pital, where they are provided with beds, bread, wine, morning and evening, for three days. The church over the &s;anta ca&s;a is of I&s;trian &s;tone, and the iron grates before the &s;e|veral chapels in it, are &s;aid to have been forged out of the fetters of four thou&s;and Chri&s;tians, who, by the naval victory of Lepanto, in 1571, were re|lea&s;ed from Turki&s;h &s;lavery. Above twenty Je|&s;uits attend con&s;tantly, as confe&s;&s;ors, in the church, by one or other of whom every language, &s;poken in Europe, is under&s;tood. A hundred and twenty-three ma&s;&s;es are daily &s;aid in the ca&s;a &s;anta, and the church that enclo&s;es it. The eunuchs belonging to the choir here &s;ay ma&s;s, and, on the&s;e occa&s;ions, carry their te&s;ticles about them in a &s;mall box. Lo|retto derives its name from Laureta, the lady in

who&s;e field the &s;anta ca&s;a was fir&s;t pitched. It was a very unwhole&s;ome place, until pope Cle|ment VII. cau&s;ed the mar&s;hes about it to be drain|ed, the woods cut down, and the hills levelled. Its fortifications are of little importance, unle&s;s a|gain&s;t the &s;udden attacks of pirates, and there is &s;eldom any garri&s;on; but the number of inhabi|tants in the town and its &s;uburbs is computed at about &s;even thou&s;and, and no &s;ooner is a Turki&s;h &s;quadron known to be at &s;ea, than they are rein|forced by a &s;trong garri&s;on from the neighbouring country. The town is &s;upplied with excellent water from the adjacent hills, by means of an aque|duct and fountain. The annual revenue of the ca&s;a &s;anta from lands, and other &s;ettled funds, is &s;aid to be thirty thou&s;and &s;cudi, exclu&s;ive of the pre&s;ents and offerings of devotees. In the di&s;pen|&s;ary, are thirty-eight gallipots, with covers, of Fayence porcelain, highly valued for the paintings on them, which are &s;aid to have been done by Ra|phael. The people of Loretto, be&s;ides what they get by keeping inns, public-hou&s;es, and lodging &s;trangers, make medals, crucifixes, images of the Virgin, painted paper caps, ribbons, and ro&s;aries, which are bought by the pilgrims, as amulets for the head-ach, fits, and other di&s;ea&s;es. The town is about a mile in circumfrence. There is a fine pro&s;pect from it towards the &s;ea; and from Monte Reale in the neighbourhood, the mountains of Croatia, though a hundred and fifty miles off, may be &s;een in a morning, in clear weather. In the cellar of the ca&s;a &s;anta, are generally upwards of a hundred and forty very large ca&s;ks of different &s;orts of wine. Travellers are pe&s;tered with &s;warms of beggars in the town and country about Loretto.</P>

<P>The utmo&s;t extent of this territory, from north to &s;outh, is not above twenty-eight miles, and from ea&s;t to we&s;t about thirty. It contains the lake antiently called Lacus Thra&s;imenus, and now Lago di Perugia, near which Hannibal defeated the Romans, under the command of the con&s;ul Flaminius. The only place in it worth mention|ing, is that from which it takes its name, viz.</P>
<P>Perugia, which was antiently called Peru&s;ia, and &s;uffered the mo&s;t dreadful calamities during the triumvirate of Augu&s;tus and his colleagues. It was al&s;o, after a &s;even years &s;iege, taken and de|&s;troyed by Totila, king of the Goths; but was afterwards rebuilt by Nar&s;es. In the ninth cen|tury the French took it, and gave it to the holy &s;ee, to which it hath belonged ever &s;ince, and is now the &s;ee of a bi&s;hop, and has an univer&s;ity, with two academies, three colleges, &s;everal churches, and a citadel, &s;tanding about &s;ixty-one miles almo&s;t north-we&s;t from Rome.

<P>This duchy extends from north to &s;outh about forty-&s;even miles, and about &s;ixty-five from we&s;t to ea&s;t. The &s;oil of a great part of it is low and fenny, yet, in general, rich and fertile. The places of mo&s;t note are,</P>
<P>Spoleto, antiently one of the mo&s;t celebrated municipal towns in Italy, and even now the capi|tal of the duchy. It &s;tands &s;eventy miles north of Rome, and is noted for an aqueduct, by which water, to &s;upply the city and ca&s;tle, is conveyed from Mount St. Francis over a valley. There is al&s;o a bridge laid over a valley, betwixt the city and ca&s;tle. The number of convents, churches, hermitages, and fraternities here is very con&s;ide|rable. Here al&s;o is the &s;ee of a bi&s;hop, who is im|mediately &s;ubject to the pope. In the neighbouring mountains are found truffles in great plenty.</P>
<P>Foligno, antiently Fulginium, a &s;m&agrave;ll town, fourteen miles north-we&s;t of Spoleto. Here are &s;ome manufactures and trade, and a famed fair which la&s;ts a month. It is the &s;ee of a bi&s;hop, and the neighbouring country is extremely beau|tiful.</P>
<P>Narni, antiently Narnia, a poor town, fourteen miles &s;outh-we&s;t from Spoleto. It is the &s;ee of a bi&s;hop, and is &s;upplied with water by a noble a|queduct, fifteen miles long. But the greate&s;t cu|rio&s;ity here, is the remains of a grand marble bridge, built, as it is &s;aid, by Augu&s;tus, over the river Nera, &s;o as to join two oppo&s;ite mountains.
<PB N="434" REF="4410">
This was the birth-place of the emperor Nerva. The neighbouring country is extremely beautiful, abounding with vines, fig, peach, and olive|trees, fine melons, prodigious large turnips, and other fruits. Of the grapes, there is a particular &s;ort here without &s;tones, called uvae pa&s;&s;ae, or pa&s;&s;arinae.</P>
<P>Terni, antiently &s;tiled Interamna, from its &s;itu|ation betwixt two branches of the river Nera. It is a pretty well built, and well inhabited town, and the &s;ee of a bi&s;hop, &s;ituated about twelve miles &s;outh from Spoleto, and thirty-four north from Rome. The emperors Tacitus and Florianus, and Tacitus the hi&s;torian, were born here. The ruins al&s;o of an antient theatre are &s;till vi&s;ible; and not far from hence is the famous ca&s;cade form|ed by the fall of the river Velino, which ru&s;hes down a precipice a hundred yards high. The mi&s;t about the ca&s;cade looks, at a di&s;tance, like clouds of &s;moke a&s;cending from &s;ome va&s;t furnace, and di&s;tils in a perpetual &s;mall rain on all the places that lie near it. The noi&s;e made by it is altogether a&s;toni&s;hing. About &s;ix or &s;even miles al&s;o from Terni is Mount Eolo, from the cavities of which in &s;ummer i&s;&s;ues a &s;trong cooling wind, which the inhabitants of the little town of Ce&s;i, which &s;tands hard by, convey by pipes into their hou&s;es, in the &s;ame manner as water.</P>
<P>There are &s;everal other little towns in the duchy, particularly A&s;&s;i&s;io, where St. Francis was born; Nocera, antiently Nuceria, a bi&s;hopric, and noted for its hot baths; Spello, antiently Hi&s;pellum, where are &s;ome remains of antiquity; Bevagna, antiently Mevania, near the &s;ource of the famous river Clitumnus, where is the chapel of St. Salva|dore, &s;uppo&s;ed to have been formerly the temple of Clitumnus; Todi, antiently Tuder; Amelia, an|tiently Ameria; Otricolo, near where the old Sa|bine

<HEAD>The DUCHY of CASTRO, and EARLDOM of RONCIGLIONE.</HEAD>
<P>The&s;e territories belonged formerly to the hou&s;e of Farne&s;e; but were at la&s;t annexed to the papal dominions, in lieu of a debt, for which they had been mortgaged, but never redeemed. They are naturally fertile in corn and fruit, but ill peopled, and wor&s;e cultivated. The only places in them worth mentioning are,</P>
<P>Ca&s;tro, which was formerly a hand&s;ome town; but, in the year 1646, was de&s;troyed by pope In|nocent X. becau&s;e the inhabitants had murdered the bi&s;hop he had &s;ent them. In the duchy to which it &s;till gives name, lies a part of the lake of Bol&s;ena, with two i&s;lands, in one of which Ama|la&s;untha, the daughter of Theodoric, king of the O&s;trogoths, was confined, and afterwards mur|dered, by order of her cou&s;in Theodat, whom &s;he had a&s;&s;ociated with her in the government.</P>

<P>So called from a pretended grant of it made by Con&s;tantine the Great to Sylve&s;ter, bi&s;hop of Rome, in 324, for the maintenance of the church of St. Peter, and its bi&s;hops; but this grant, in fact, is &s;aid to have been made by the counte&s;s Matilda, in the year 1077. The principal places in it are,</P>
<P>Viterbo, the capital, thirty-three miles north|we&s;t of Rome. It is pretty large, well built, and contains a great number of churches and convents; but that of the inhabitants is but &s;mall, con&s;ider|ing its extent. It is the &s;ee of a bi&s;hop, who is im|mediately under the pope. Here are two acade|mies of wits, the one called Gly O&s;tinati, and the other Gli Ardenti. The number of the inhabi|tants is &s;aid to be about &s;ixteen thou&s;and, a con&s;i|derable part of whom con&s;i&s;ts of prie&s;ts, and monks of all orders.

<P>Bol&s;ena, a town delightfully &s;ituated on the lake to which it gives name, but otherwi&s;e of little note. Near it, on an eminence, are the ruins of the antient Vol&s;inium.</P>
<P>Monte Fia&s;cone, a mean place on a mountain, about thirty-four miles north of Rome, and noted for its white mu&s;cadel wine. Its name is thought to be derived from the Fali&s;ci, who formerly in|habited the adjacent country.</P>
<P>Civita Ca&s;tellana, a &s;mall town, about twenty miles north-we&s;t from Rome. It is &s;aid to be the antient Falerios, once the capital of the Fali&s;ci, and &s;tands near the conflux of the Triglia and Te|vere. Here is a bridge of extraordinary height, built over a deep narrow valley.</P>
<P>Civita Vecchia, a fortified &s;ea-port, about thirty miles north-we&s;t from Rome. The harbour is

commodious enough, though not quite &s;heltered from all winds. The pope's gallies commonly lie here. Though the air is &s;aid to be unwhole&s;ome, and good water &s;carce, yet were it declared a free port, it is thought it would greatly le&s;&s;en the trade of Leghorn.</P>
<P>Fiumicino, a con&s;iderable place at the mouth of the we&s;t branch of the Tiber. All &s;orts of fi&s;h are brought from hence to Rome, e&s;pecially fine oy|&s;ters. Here is a fortified tower and garri&s;on, with a cu&s;tom-hou&s;e.</P>

<P>This country is what the antient Romans called Latium, or at lea&s;t the greater part of it. The air is &s;aid to be unwhole&s;ome, which is partly owing to the Pomptine mar&s;hes and many lakes in it, and partly to a rich, but uncultivated &s;oil, the inhabi|tants being few, and the&s;e poor, lazy, and indo|lent. The chief places in it are,</P>
<P>Rome, antiently the capital and &s;eat of the Ro|man empire, and now the head of the Roman ca|tholic religion. What a melancholy rever&s;e! Rome that was once the abode and nur&s;ery of heroes, and
<PB N="438" REF="4450">
of all that was great and noble in human nature, is now a ne&s;t of drones; a nur&s;ery of vermin, that prey upon the community; a &s;cene of the gro&s;&s;e&s;t prie&s;t craft; of the mo&s;t ridiculous farces, under the name of religion; of eccle&s;ia&s;tical tyranny, and the mo&s;t wanton abu&s;e of the blind zeal, credulity, fanatici&s;m, and ignorance, of a weak, deluded laity. Rome, after &s;he had lo&s;t her liberty, &s;unk into the utmo&s;t degeneracy, &s;lavery, and corrup|tion, and was trampled under foot by a &s;et of the vile&s;t mon&s;ters and tyrants that ever di&s;graced hu|man nature: but her thraldom was not then greater under her &s;ecular, than it is now under her &s;piri|tual ma&s;ters. Rome is generally believed to have been founded by Romulus, upwards of &s;even hun|dred years before Chri&s;t, after which it was gradu|ally enlarged, till it took up the following twelve, or rather thirteen hills, viz. Monte Capitolino, Pa|latino, Aventino, Celio, E&s;quilino, Viminale, Quirinale, Monte Cavallo, Janiculo, Pincino, Vaticano, Citorio, and Giardino; but its figure and &s;ituation have been often changed, in con&s;e|quence of the many &s;ieges it hath &s;u&s;tained. It is thought the walls of the modern Rome take in nearly the &s;ame extent of ground as the antient; but the difference between the number of buildings on this &s;pot is very great, one half of modern Rome lying wa&s;te, or occupied with gardens, fields, meadows, and vineyards. One may walk quite round the city in three or four hours at mo&s;t, the circumference being reckoned about thirteen Ita|lian miles. With regard to the number of the in|habitants, modern Rome is al&s;o greatly inferior to the antient; for, in 1709, the whole of the&s;e a|mounted only to one hundred thirty-eight thou&s;and five hundred and &s;ixty-eight; among which were forty bi&s;hops, two thou&s;and &s;ix hundred and eighty|&s;ix prie&s;ts, three thou&s;and five hundred and fifty-nine
<PB N="439" REF="4460">
monks, one thou&s;and eight hundred and four|teen nuns, three hundred ninety-three courte&s;ans, about eight or nine thou&s;and Jews, and fourteen Moors. In 1714 the number was increa&s;ed to one hundred and forty-three thou&s;and. In external &s;plendor, and the beauty of its temples and palaces, modern Rome is thought by the mo&s;t judicious travellers to excel the antient. There was nothing in antient Rome to be compared with St. Peter's church in the modern. That Rome was able to recover it&s;elf after &s;o many calamities and deva&s;ta|tions, will not be matter of &s;urprize, if we con&s;ider the prodigious &s;ums that it has &s;o long annually drawn from all countries of the popi&s;h per&s;ua&s;ion. The&s;e &s;ums, though &s;till con&s;iderable, have been continually decrea&s;ing &s;ince the Reformation. The &s;urface of the ground on which Rome was origi|nally founded, is &s;urpri&s;ingly altered. At pre&s;ent it is difficult to di&s;tingui&s;h the &s;even hills on which it was fir&s;t built, the low grounds being almo&s;t filled up with the ruins of the antient &s;treets and hou&s;es, and the great quantities of earth wa&s;hed down from the hills by the violence of rains. Antiently the &s;uburbs extended a va&s;t way on all &s;ides, and made the city appear almo&s;t boundle&s;s; but it is quite otherwi&s;e now, the country about Rome being al|mo&s;t a de&s;ert. To this, and other cau&s;es, it is owing, that the air is none of the mo&s;t whole&s;ome, e&s;pecially during the &s;ummer heats, when few go abroad in the day-time. No city at pre&s;ent in the world &s;urpa&s;&s;es, or indeed equals Rome, for the multiplicity of fine fountains, noble edifices, anti|quities, curio&s;ities, paintings, &s;tatues, and &s;culp|tures. To particularize the&s;e would fill a vo|lume: be&s;ides, they have already been de&s;cribed at large by &s;everal modern authors, particularly Key&s;ler. The city &s;tands on the Tyber, ten miles from the Tu&s;can &s;ea, three hundred and
<PB N="440" REF="4470">
eighty from Vienna, five hundred and &s;ixty from Paris, &s;even hundred and forty from Am&s;terdam, eight hundred and ten from London, and nine hundred from Madrid. The Tyber is &s;ubject to frequent inundations, by which it often does great damage. A &s;mall part of the city is &s;eparated from the other by the river, and is therefore called Tra&s;tevere, or beyond the Tyber. There are &s;eve|ral bridges over the river, a great number of towers on the walls, and twenty gates. The remains of Rome's antient grandeur con&s;i&s;t of &s;tatues, co|lo&s;&s;us's, temples, palaces, theatres, naumachias, triumphal arches, cirques, columns, obeli&s;ks, foun|tains, aqueducts, mau&s;oleums, thermae, or hot|baths, and other &s;tructures. Of modern buildings, the &s;plendid churches and palaces are the mo&s;t re|markable. Mr. Addi&s;on &s;ays, it is almo&s;t impo&s;|&s;ible for a man to form in his imagination &s;uch beautiful and glorious &s;cenes, as are to be met with in &s;everal of the Roman churches and chapels. This gentleman tells us al&s;o, that no part of the anti|quities of Rome plea&s;ed him &s;o much as the antient &s;tatues, of which there is &s;till an incredible variety. Next to the &s;tatues he &s;ays, there is nothing more &s;urpri&s;ing, than the amazing variety of antient pil|lars of &s;o many kinds of marble. Rome is &s;aid to be well paved, but not well lighted, nor kept very clean. Two thirds of the hou&s;es are the property of the churches, convents, and alms-hou&s;es. Pro|te&s;tants are not obliged to kneel at the elevation of the ho&s;t, or at meeting the euchari&s;t in the &s;treets; and they may have fle&s;h meat always at the inns, even during Lent. Here are a great many acade|mies for promoting arts and &s;ciences, be&s;ides the univer&s;ity. The carnival here is only during the eight days before Lent, and there are no &s;uch &s;cenes of riot as at Venice: pro&s;titutes, however, are publicly tolerated. To maintain good order

Near it al&s;o is the Lago di Bagni, or Solfatara, whence the river Solfatara i&s;&s;ues, and in which are &s;ome &s;mall floating i&s;lands, that are driven about by the wind.

<HEAD>The REPUBLIC of St. MARINO.</HEAD>
<P>This &s;mall republic con&s;i&s;ts only of a mountain, and a few hillocks, that lie &s;cattered about the bot|tom of it. The number of the inhabitants is about five thou&s;and. The mountain yields good wine, but they have no other than rain or &s;now water. The founder of the republic was a Dalmatian, and a ma&s;on, who, upwards of thirteen hundred years ago, turned hermit, and retired to this mountain. Here his devotion and au&s;terity, and in con&s;equence of that, his reputation for &s;anctity, were &s;uch, that the prince&s;s of the country made him a pre&s;ent of the mountain, on which many, out of veneration for the &s;aint, &s;oon after, took up their abode. Thus was the foundation laid of the town and re|public, which &s;till bears the name of the &s;aint. The town &s;tands on the top of the mountain, and there is only one way by which it can be come at. In the whole territory are only three ca&s;tles, three
<PB N="445" REF="4520">
convents, and five churches. The large&s;t of the churches is dedicated to the &s;aint, and contains his a&s;hes and his &s;tatue. He is looked upon as the greate&s;t &s;aint, next to the ble&s;&s;ed Virgin; and to &s;peak di&s;re&s;pectfully of him is accounted bla&s;|phemy, and puni&s;hed as &s;uch. The republic is under the protection of the pope. All that are ca|pable of bearing arms are exerci&s;ed, and ready at a minute's call. In the ordinary cour&s;e of govern|ment, the admini&s;tration is in the hands of the council of &s;ixty, which, notwith&s;tanding its name, con&s;i&s;ts only of forty; one half of the members of which are of the noble families, and the other of the plebeian: on extraordinary occa&s;ions, however, the arengo, in which every hou&s;e has its repre&s;entative, is called together. The two principal officers are the capitaneos, who are cho&s;en every half year; and next to them is the commi&s;&s;ary, who judges in civil and criminal matters, and is joined in com|mi&s;&s;ion with the capitaneos: both he and the phy|&s;ician mu&s;t be foreigners, and both have their &s;ala|ries out of the public &s;tock. When any per&s;on, after due &s;ummons, neglects to a&s;&s;i&s;t at the coun|cil, according to their &s;tatute-book, he is to be fined in about a penny Engli&s;h; and when an am|ba&s;&s;ador is to be &s;ent to any foreign &s;tate, he is to be allowed about a &s;hilling a day.</P>

<HEAD>The KINGDOM of NAPLES.</HEAD>
<P>This kingdom, by far the large&s;t &s;tate in Italy, and comprehending in it the antient countries of Samnium, Campania, Apulia, and Magna Graecia, hath its pre&s;ent name from its capital. Formerly, it was &s;ometimes called Sicily on this &s;ide the Pha|ro, viz. of Me&s;&s;ina, whence the pre&s;ent king, who is al&s;o po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of Sicily, is called king of the Two Sicilies. It is bounded on all &s;ides by the Mediter|ranean
<PB N="446" REF="4530">
and the Adriatic, except on the north-ea&s;t, where it terminates on the Eccle&s;ia&s;tical State. Its greate&s;t length, from &s;outh-ea&s;t to north we&s;t, is about two hundred and eighty Engli&s;h miles; and its breadth, from the north-ea&s;t to the &s;outh-we&s;t, from ninety-&s;ix to an hundred and twenty.</P>
<P>The air of this country is extremely hot, e&s;pe|cially in July, Augu&s;t, and September. In winter there is &s;eldom any ice or &s;now, except on the mountains. On account of its fertility, it is ju&s;tly termed an earthly paradi&s;e; for it abounds with all &s;orts of grain; the fine&s;t fruit and garden pro|ductions, of every kind; with rice, flax, oil, and wine, in the greate&s;t plenty and perfection. It af|fords al&s;o &s;affron, manna, alum, vitriol, &s;ulphur, rock-cry&s;tal, marble, and &s;everal &s;orts of minerals, together with fine wool, and &s;ilk. The hor&s;es of this country are famous, and the flocks and herds very numerous. Be&s;ides the&s;e products, of which a con&s;iderable part is exported, there are manufac|tures of &s;nuff, &s;oap, and gla&s;s-ware. Wai&s;tcoats, caps, &s;tockings, and gloves, are al&s;o made of the hair or filaments of a &s;hell-fi&s;h, which are warmer than tho&s;e of wool, and of a beautiful glo&s;&s;y green. In this kingdom likewi&s;e is found that called the Phrygian &s;tone, or pietra fungifera, which, being laid in a damp &s;hady place, will yield mu&s;hrooms, &s;ometimes of a very large &s;ize, e&s;pecially if the &s;tone is &s;prinkled with hot water.</P>
<P>As to the mountains of this country, the princi|pal are tho&s;e of the Apennine, which traver&s;e it from &s;outh to north; and Mount Ve&s;uvius, which, as is well known, is a noted volcano, five Italian miles from Naples. The &s;ide of this mountain next the &s;ea yields wine, particularly the two famed wines, called Vino Greco, and Lachrymae Chri&s;ti. One of the greate&s;t inconveniencies to which this kingdom is ex|po&s;ed is earthquakes, which the eruptions of Mount
<PB N="447" REF="4540">
Ve&s;uvius contribute, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, to prevent. Another inconveniency, which, however, is com|mon to it with other hot countries, is the great number of reptiles and in&s;ects, of which &s;ome are venomous, as &s;corpions, and a kind of &s;piders, call|ed tarantulas, from the city of Tarento, where they are more common, and more dangerous, than in other parts.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to religion, it is on a very bad foot|ing here. The number of convents and mona&s;te|ries is really a&s;toni&s;hing. It is &s;aid, the clergy and convents po&s;&s;e&s;s two thirds of the whole kingdom: nay, &s;ome maintain, that were the kingdom divided into five parts, four would be found in the hands of the church. Notwith&s;tanding this power and in|fluence of the clergy, they have not been able hi|therto to get the inqui&s;ition e&s;tabli&s;hed here. In the year 1731, mea&s;ures were al&s;o taken for le&s;&s;en|ing the number of convents; and, very lately, the order of Je&s;uits hath been &s;uppre&s;&s;ed. The papal bulls cannot be made public without the king's permi&s;&s;ion; nor are prote&s;tants compelled to kneel in the churches, or at the meeting the ho&s;t; and in Lent they can very ea&s;ily procure fle&s;h|meat. In the year 1740, the Jews were allowed to &s;ettle in the kingdom, during the term of fifty years, and &s;everal privileges were granted them du|ring that period; at the expiration of which, the grant was to be &s;uppo&s;ed to be renewed, unle&s;s they were expre&s;ly ordered to quit the country.</P>
<P>The revenue of the kingdom is generally com|puted at three millions of crowns; but, as Mr. Addi&s;on ob&s;erves, there is no country in Europe which pays greater taxes, and where, at the &s;ame time, the public is le&s;s the better for them, mo&s;t of them going to the enriching of the private per&s;ons to whom they are mortgaged.</P>

With re&s;pect to the money of Naples, three qua|trini make one grana; ten grana one carlino; two carlini one taro; five taro, or ten carlini, one du|cato; twenty-five carlini one ongaro; twenty-&s;ix one zechino; and forty-five a Spani&s;h pi&s;tole.</P>
<P>The military force of this kingdom is &s;aid to con|&s;i&s;t of about thirty-thou&s;and men, of which the Swi&s;s regiments are the be&s;t. As to the marine, it con&s;i&s;ts only of a few gallies. The only order here is that of St. Januarius, which was in&s;tituted by Don Carlos, in the year 1738.</P>
<P>The king of Naples, or of the Two Sicilies, is an hereditary monarch. The high colleges are the council of &s;tate, the privy-council, the trea&s;ury, the Sicily-council, the council of war, &amp;c. This king|dom is a papal fief; and the king, in ackowledg|ment of the pope's feudal right, &s;ends him, every year, a white palfry, and a pur&s;e of &s;ix thou&s;and ducats. The title of the king's elde&s;t &s;on is prince of Cala|bria. The number both of the high and low nobility in the kingdom of Naples is very great; but their incomes, in general, are very &s;lender. The higher nobles con&s;i&s;t of princes, dukes, marqui&s;&s;es, and barons. The general a&s;&s;embly of the &s;tates, con|&s;i&s;ting of the nobility and commons, is &s;ummoned, every two years, to meet at the capital, to deliberate on the cu&s;tomary free gift to the crown.</P>
<P>Naples had kings of its own, after the ex|pul&s;ion of the Saracens, until about the year 1504, when it fell under the dominion of Spain; the kings of Spain continued ma&s;ters of it until 1707, when the Spaniards were di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the Imperiali&s;ts; and, in 1713, the kingdom was confirmed to the emperor Charles VI. by the treaty of Utrecht; but, in 1734, the Spaniards again made them&s;elves ma&s;ters both of Naples and Sicily, which, in 1736, were formally ceded to Don Car|los, now king of Spain, and his heirs male and fe|male,

in con&s;equence of which, one of his &s;ons is now king of the Two Sicilies.</P>
<P>The inhabitants of this country bear but an in|different character among other nations; but if they are really as defective in this re&s;pect as they are repre&s;ented, it is undoubtedly, in &s;ome mea&s;ure at lea&s;t, owing to the oppre&s;&s;ion and &s;lavery under which they groan, both from their civil and eccle|&s;ia&s;tic governors. This kingdom is divided into twelve provinces or juri&s;dictions, in which the prin|cipal places are,</P>
<P>Naples, antiently Parthenope, afterwards Nea|polis, the capital of the kingdom, lying in the province called Terra di Lavora, which is the riche&s;t and be&s;t inhabited of the whole kingdom, and comprehends a part of the antient Campania Felix, or the happy. This city is &s;aid to be the fir&s;t for &s;trength and neatne&s;s, and the third, for bigne&s;s, in all Italy. It is mo&s;t advantageou&s;ly &s;ituated, having a delicious country on one &s;ide, and a noble bay of the Mediterranean on the other, with an excellent harbour. The circumference, including the &s;uburbs, is &s;aid not to be le&s;s than eighteen Italian miles, and the number of the in|habitants therein above four hundred thou&s;and. The hou&s;es are of &s;tone, flat-roofed, and generally lofty and uniform; but many of them have bal|conies, with lattice windows. The &s;treets are well paved; but they are not lighted at night, and, in the day-time, are disfigured, in many places, by &s;talls, on which provi&s;ions are expo&s;ed to &s;ale. Here are a great number of fine churches, convents, fountains, and palaces of the nobility, many of whom con&s;tantly re&s;ide here. It is u&s;ual to walk on the tops of the hou&s;es in the evenings, to breathe the &s;weet cool air, after a hot &s;ultry day. The climate here is &s;o mild and warm, even in win|ter, that plenty of green pea&s;e, artichokes, a&s;paragus,
<PB N="450" REF="4570">
and other vegetables may be had &s;o early as the beginning of the new year, and even all the winter. This city &s;warms with monks and nuns of all &s;orts, to &s;uch a degree, that there are no le&s;s than nineteen convents of the Dominicans alone, eighteen of the Franci&s;cans, eight of the Augu&s;tines, and in proportion of the re&s;t. The magnificence of many of the churches exceeds imagination. In a cloy&s;ter of the Carthu&s;ian mona&s;tery is a crucifix, &s;aid to be done by Mi|chael Angelo, of inimitable workman&s;hip. The fortifications of Naples are very &s;trong, both towards the land and the &s;ea, there being no le&s;s than five ca&s;tles: yet the city is far from being &s;ecure from a bombardment; for the &s;ea is &s;o deep, that a large ve&s;&s;el may come up to the very mole, and there is nothing to prevent an enemy's approaches on that &s;ide, but a few gallies, the mole, and two &s;mall ca&s;tles. Pictures, &s;tatues, and antiquities are not &s;o common in Naples, as might be expected in &s;o great and antient a city, many of the mo&s;t valuable pieces having been &s;ent to Spain by the viceroys. There are &s;everal very delightful pro&s;pects about Naples, e&s;pecially from &s;ome of the religious hou&s;es. The bay is one of the fine&s;t in the world, being almo&s;t of a round figure, of about thirty miles in the diameter, and three parts of it &s;heltered with a noble circuit of woods and mountains. The city &s;tands in the bo&s;om of this bay, in as plea&s;ant a &s;ituation, per|haps, as in the world. Mr. Key&s;ler &s;ays, they reckon about eighteen thou&s;and donne libere, or courtezans, in the city. Though the com|mon people are generally &s;o lazy, as to prefer beggary or robbing to labour; yet there are &s;ome flouri&s;hing manufactures here, and a bri&s;k trade. The city is &s;upplied with a va&s;t quantity of water, by means of a very co&s;tly aqueduct, from the foot
<PB N="451" REF="4580">
of mount Ve&s;uvius. Mr. Addi&s;on &s;ays, it is incredible how great a multitude of retainers to the law there are in Naples, who find continual em|ployment from the fiery temper of the inhabitants. There are five piazzas or &s;quares in the city, ap|propriated to the nobility, viz. tho&s;e called Ca|puana, Nido, Montagna, Porto, and Porta Nova. Of all the palaces, that of the king is not only the mo&s;t magnificent, but al&s;o in the be&s;t &s;tile of architecture. The cathedral, though Gothic, is a very grand &s;plendid edifice. It is here that the head and blood of St. Januarius, the tutelary &s;aint of Naples are kept, the latter in two gla&s;s or cry&s;tal vials. The pretended liquefaction of the dried blood, as &s;oon as brought near the head of the &s;aint, is a thing well known; Mr. Addi&s;on &s;ays, it is one of the mo&s;t bungling tricks he ever &s;aw. The harbour is &s;pacious, and kept in good repair. It is fortified with a mole, which runs above a quarter of mile into the &s;ea, and, at the extremity, has a high lantern, to direct &s;hips &s;afely into the harbour. Luxury here is re&s;trained by &s;evere &s;umptuary laws, and the women are more clo&s;ely confined than in any other city of Italy. Here is an univer&s;ity and two acade|mies of wits, the one called Gli Ardenti, and the other Gli Otio&s;i. The nunnery for ladies of quality is &s;aid to be the large&s;t in the whole world, containing no le&s;s than three hundred and fifty nuns, be&s;ides &s;ervants. The mount of Piety, or the office for advancing money to the poor, on pledges, at a low intere&s;t, or without any, has an income of upwards of fifty thou&s;and ducats. The ar&s;enal is &s;aid to contain arms for fifty thou&s;and men. The walls of the city con&s;i&s;t of hard black quarry &s;tones, called piperno. In&s;tead of ice, va&s;t quantities of &s;now are u&s;ed for cooling their li|quors, not &s;o much as water being drank without

it; &s;o that, it is &s;aid, a &s;carcity of it would as &s;oon occa&s;ion a mutiny, as a dearth of corn or provi|&s;ions. Certain per&s;ons, who farm the monopoly of it from the government, &s;upply the city all the year round from a mountain about eighteen miles off, at &s;o much the pound. Naples &s;tands one hundred and ten miles &s;outh-ea&s;t from Rome, one hundred and &s;ixty-four north-ea&s;t from Palermo in Sicily, two hundred and &s;eventeen &s;outh-ea&s;t from Florence, and three hundred from Venice.</P>
<P>In the neighbourhood of this city are &s;everal re|markable particulars, which tho' they have been often de&s;cribed by travellers, mu&s;t not be pa&s;&s;ed over without any notice. Of the&s;e, the chief are mount Ve&s;uvius, a noted volcano, the grotto of Pau|&s;elipo, the lago d'Ag$ono, grotto del Cani, and Solfatara. Ve&s;uvius is five Italian miles from Naples: one &s;ide of it, as we ob&s;erved already, produces &s;everal &s;orts of wine; but the &s;outh and we&s;t &s;ides, as well as the top, are covered with black cinders and a&s;hes. From the foot of the mountain to the fummit, are about three Italian miles. The a&s;cent, by rea&s;on of the &s;teepne&s;s of the mountain, and the loo&s;e a&s;hes, is very toil&s;ome and tedious; but there are &s;ome pea&s;ants that live about the mountain, who, for a &s;mall matter, a&s;&s;i&s;t travellers in clambering up: they wear lea|thern belts, which the &s;trangers take hold of, in order to render their a&s;cent more ea&s;y. From the volcano often i&s;&s;ues a &s;tream of lava, or a com|po&s;ition of me$ted metals, &s;ulphur, minerals, &amp;c. which often does a great deal of damage, running down the &s;ide of the mountain like a river, and carrying all before it. From chymical experi|ments it appears, that the &s;tones, ejected by Ve|&s;uvius, are impregnated with bitumen, &s;ulphur, vitriol, alum, antimony, ar&s;enic, and other mine|rals and fo&s;&s;ils. As one approaches the volcano,
<PB N="453" REF="4600">
if the mountain is actually belching out matter' the a&s;hes grow hotter and hotter; at the &s;ame time a horrid noi&s;e is heard, like the explo&s;ion of a whole battery of cannon, and a rumbling under feet, like the continual boiling of a large caldron. Not a tree or &s;hrub is to be &s;een on the top of the mountain: the hollow, whence the eruptions i&s;&s;ue, is very large, and goes &s;helving down on all &s;ides. When the mountain is quiet this hollow may be &s;afely looked into; but even then it is generally filled with &s;moke. During the eruptions, it is filled with glowing and meited matter, which, as it boils over in any part, runs down the &s;ides of the mountain like a torrent. At the&s;e times al&s;o va&s;t quantities of a&s;hes, cinders, and huge &s;tones are thrown out. Not far from this mountain is the village of Portici, where is a royal palace, with an amazing collection of antiquities, mo&s;tly dug out of the ruins of the antient city of Heraclea, or Herculaneum, which &s;tood near this &s;pot, and was de&s;troyed partly by an earthquake, and partly by an eruption of mount Ve&s;uvius. Several volumes, giving an account of the&s;e antiquities, have been publi&s;hed; and the digging is &s;till continued.</P>
<P>In tho&s;e parts of the &s;ea not far from the roots of Ve&s;uvius, is found &s;ometimes a very fragrant oil, which is &s;old dear, and makes a rich perfume. It is &s;kimmed off the &s;urface of the &s;ea, in calm warm weather, into boats, and afterwards put into pots and jars.</P>
<P>In the road leading from the &s;uburbs of Chiaia to the grotto del Monte di Pau&s;ilipo, is the remains of a tomb or mau&s;oleum, &s;uppo&s;ed to be that of Virgil, but without any foundation: it was original|ly in the form of a pyramid, but now re&s;embles a large oven. It is certain, &s;ays Mr. Addi&s;on, that Virgil was buried at Naples, but almo&s;t as certain, that his tomb &s;tood on the other &s;ide of the town.

At Sorrento, near mount Ve&s;uvius, are &s;hewn &s;ome laurel-trees, which, it is pretended, grew up &s;pontaneou&s;ly out of the ruins of the hou&s;e in which the celebrated poet Torquato Ta&s;&s;o is &s;aid to have been born.</P>
<P>That called the grotto or cave of Pau&s;ilipo, lies betwixt Naples and Puzzuolo, or Puteoli. It is a broad &s;ubterraneous road, hewn through a moun|tain in a &s;traight line. On each &s;ide of the moun|tain, two vent-holes are cut near the middle for the admi&s;&s;ion of air and light, quite through the roof of the grotto, which, at the entrance at each end, is near a hundred feet high, but towards the middle much lower; the breadth is between eighteen and twenty feet, and the length &s;omething above half an Italian mile; it is paved with broad &s;tones, like the &s;treets of Naples: at coming out of the grotto the road turns to the right hand, and brings one to the lake of Agnano, which of is a circular figure, and about an Italian mile in circumference. On this lake &s;tand the &s;udatories of St. Germano, which are &s;tone apartments, where the hot &s;teams, ari&s;ing from the earth, &s;oon produce a profu&s;e &s;weat on tho&s;e that u&s;e them. They are &s;aid to be efficaci|ous in the gout, weakne&s;s of the limbs, venereal infections, and internal impo&s;thumes. In a rock near the banks of the lake is al&s;o the Grotto del Cane, or Dog's-grotto, a dog being the animal commonly pitched upon, to &s;hew &s;trangers the &s;urprizing effect of the vapour in this cavity; and hard by it is a hut where dogs are actually kept for that purpo&s;e. The vapour floats within a foot of the &s;urface of the grotto, in which, if a dog has his no&s;e held, he &s;oon lo&s;es all &s;igns of life; but if brought into the open air, or thrown into the lake, he quickly recovers, if he is not quite &s;uffocated; but the&s;e &s;ulphureous exhalations are no le&s;s fatal to other animals. To enumerate the different baths

to be met with in a country that &s;o much abounds with &s;ulphur, and where there is &s;carce a di&s;ea&s;e that has not one adapted to it, would be but an endle&s;s and u&s;ele&s;s labour. The monte Secco, or Solfatara, as it is commonly called, may be deemed Ve&s;uvius in miniature. Though the&s;e two moun|tains are about eight miles di&s;tant from one ano|ther, yet they &s;eem to have a communication, it having been remarked, that the more violent the eruptions of Ve&s;uvius are, the le&s;s is the &s;moke that proceeds from Solfatara, and &eacute; contra. On the &s;urface of the latter, are &s;everal fi&s;&s;ures, which are hot, and continually emit &s;moke, more or le&s;s. The &s;tones near the holes, or cracks, &s;eem to be in continual motion; and &s;mall &s;tones dropt into them are ejected to the height of twelve feet. The hot vapour, i&s;&s;uing through the&s;e apertures, is &s;aid to be very &s;alutary in pains of the eyes, ears, limbs, and &s;tomach, the head-ach, bilious fevers, and &s;terility. From the earth, &s;tones, and a&s;hes of this mountain, are extracted &s;ulphur, vitriol of a &s;apphire colour, and the be&s;t kind of alum. The &s;ummit of the mountain, which was antiently in the form of a cone, is now &s;unk into a concave oval. It is &s;o hollow underneath, that, in &s;everal places, the effect of &s;tamping on the ground, with the foot, is exactly the &s;ame as that of &s;triking a|gain&s;t a vault.

<P>Puzzuolo or Puteoli, antiently a famous city, but now only a &s;mall town, having &s;uffered much by earthquakes, wars, and irrruptions of the &s;ea. It was formerly the be&s;t port on all this coa&s;t; and the &s;tately ruins about it, with the coins, &s;eals, &amp;c. thrown up by the waves, &s;ufficiently demon&s;trate its former magnificence. It is eight Italian miles from Naples; and derives its name either from putei, pits, or from the putor, i. e. &s;tench, of the &s;ulphu|reous

vapours. It is the &s;ee of a bi&s;hop, and the cathedral, which was formerly a Pagan temple, is built of large blocks of marble. Puteoli glories in being the place where the fir&s;t Chri&s;tian com|munity in Italy was formed; for St. Paul, in his journey to Rome, we are told, found brethren in it. Here is a very commodious harbour, in which are fourteen piers, or pillars, ri&s;ing above the &s;urface of the water, which, in the time of the Romans, were joined by arches, in order to guard the city and harbour again&s;t the violence of the waves. In the neighbourhood of Puzzuolo, along the coa&s;t, are &s;everal warm baths, impregnated with alum, cop|peras, and iron. Hard by al&s;o may be &s;een the ruins of Cicero's villa; and, not far from thence, another old edifice, &s;aid to have been the country|&s;eat of Lentulus. The &s;ea has overwhelmed many palaces here, which may be &s;een at the bottom of the water in a calm day. A little from Puzzuolo lies the Lucrine lake, which is now but a puddle in compari&s;on of what it once was, having been re|duced to its pre&s;ent condition by a &s;udden earth|quake, that happened in the year 1538; and &s;wal|lowed up the town of Tripergola, with all its fine villas, gardens, and hot-baths; threw up that call|ed the Monte Nuovo; filled up part of the lake Averno, which is about a mile from the other; and, in &s;hort, quite changed the face of the neigh|bouring country from what it was formerly. The lake Avernus, formerly famous for its poi&s;onous &s;teams, is now plentifully &s;tocked with fi&s;h and fowl. Mount Gaurus, which &s;tands hard by, but is called at pre&s;ent Monte Barbaro, from one of the fruitfulle&s;t &s;pots in Italy, is now one of the mo&s;t barren. The earth of Puteoli has this peculiar pro|perty, that it hardens in the water, and, after lying in it &s;ome time, looks more like &s;tone than earth.
<PB N="457" REF="4640">
Between the Lucrine lake and that of Averno, are the thermae Neronis, or hot-baths of Nero, &s;o famed in hi&s;tory. Ea&s;tward from the lake Averno is the grotto or cave of the Cumean &s;ybil, the entrance of which is very low, but the re&s;t of a con&s;iderable height, and the length &s;everal hundred paces, after which the pa&s;&s;age is &s;topped by a wall built, as &s;ome &s;ay, on purpo&s;e, becau&s;e it would be dangerous to proceed any farther, on account of the dampne&s;s of the place; for this cave is &s;aid to have reached to Cumae, which is nine miles di&s;tant, where, we are told, the other end is to be &s;een, but quite choaked up with rubbi&s;h. At a little di&s;tance from this cave is the &s;tinking fen or lake, called Acheron or Palus Acheru&s;ia, and by Virgil, from its black wa|ter, Palus Tenebro&s;a. It is now called Lago del|la Colluccia, or del Fu&s;aro, and has a communica|tion with the &s;ea by a canal, whence its water is much le&s;s offen&s;ive than formerly. The next thing remarkable here is the Ely&s;ian Fields, extremely delightful in re&s;pect of their &s;ituation, and the &s;weetne&s;s of the climate; but the whole &s;pot is now covered with bu&s;hes, briars, and ruins of an|tient monuments, it having been a famed burying-place in the times of the Romans. Between Averno and Cumae is al&s;o part of the Via Appia, where two-hills, are joined by means of a &s;tately arch, called Arco-felice, built of bricks. After pa&s;&s;ing the Arco-felice, a narrow way leads to the remains of an antient temple, which at pre&s;ent is called II Tempio del Giganti; contiguous to which, on the left hand, is a large &s;tructure, &s;uppo&s;ed to have been a Pagan &s;epulchre. Of the city of Cu|mae, &s;o famous in antient times, only a few walls are now remaining; but there are a great many antient &s;tructures about it, be&s;ides tho&s;e we have already mentioned. Baiae, the famous winter-re|treat of the old Romans, &s;tood on a bay about two

On the other &s;ide of the lake Acheron is the promontory of Mi&s;eno, which is entirely hol|low beneath; and at the extremity of it are &s;till the remains of a pharos, or light-hou&s;e: part of the Ro|man fleet was formerly &s;tationed here. The an|tient city of Mi&s;eno, &s;ituated upon the promontory, was de&s;troyed by the Saracens, in the ninth centu|ry; &s;o that no remains of it are now to be &s;een. The&s;e are the chief curio&s;ities about Puzzuolo; but to give a full and particular account of all of them, would require much more room than we can &s;pare: we therefore proceed to the other towns.</P>

<P>Gaeta, antiently called Caieta, from Aeneas's nur&s;e, a con&s;iderable town and bi&s;hop's &s;ee, on a hill, almo&s;t environed by the &s;ea. Here is a rock of marble, called Monte della Trinita, in which is a fi&s;&s;ure, &s;everal feet wide, from top to bottom. It mu&s;t have been made by an earthquake, but the time when that happened is not known: in this fi&s;&s;ure is a flight of &s;teps, which leads to a chapel called Del Crocifi&s;&s;o, whence there is a beautiful pro&s;pect of the &s;ea.

<P>HAVING now given a brief account of the &s;everal countries on the continent of Italy, we &s;hall next take a view of its i&s;lands, beginning from the north with that of Cor&s;ica, and proceed|ing &s;outhwards.</P>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>CORSICA.</HEAD>
<P>This i&s;land lies oppo&s;ite the Genoe&s;e continent, between the Gulph of Genoa, and the i&s;land of Sardinia, extending from forty one to forty-three degrees of latitude, and from nine to ten degrees of ea&s;t longitude. Hence its greate&s;t length from Cape-Cor&s;o, which is its utmo&s;t northern point, to Cape-Bonifacio, its utmo&s;t &s;outhern verge, is about one hundred Engli&s;h miles, and its greate&s;t breadth about fifty; but &s;ome make both the length and breadth much le&s;s. It is computed to be one hundred miles di&s;tant from the city of Genoa to the &s;outh, &s;ixty from Leghorn to the &s;outh-we&s;t, and is divided into the country on this &s;ide, and be|yond the mountains; which are again &s;ubdivided into thirty-eight cantons, called by the natives pieves.</P>
<P>The i&s;land being for the mo&s;t part mountainous, woody, dry, and &s;tony, has little arable land. Some of the low grounds and vallies, however, yield corn, wine, figs, almonds, che&s;nuts, olives, and other fruits. Here is al&s;o a good breed of cattle and hor&s;es, and the woods and fore&s;ts abound with deer, and other game, together with honey and wax. There are al&s;o &s;ome &s;alt-works and hot baths on the i&s;land, with cry&s;tals, iron, and alum.

In the &s;urrounding &s;eas are caught abundance of fi&s;h, e&s;pecially tho&s;e called from the neighbouring i&s;land, Sardines, and a kind of &s;turgeon. Coral al&s;o is often found in the&s;e &s;eas, e&s;pecially in the Straits of Bonifacio. Notwith&s;tanding all this, it is but thinly peopled, by rea&s;on of its barren &s;oil, and indifferent air, the oppre&s;&s;ion and tyranny of the Genoe&s;e, while they were ma&s;ters of the i&s;land, and the continual war the inhabitants have been engaged in, in defence of their liberties, &s;ince they &s;hook off the Genoe&s;e yoke. The number of the inhabitants is computed at about one hundred and twenty thou&s;and. The clergy are very nume|rous in this i&s;land, e&s;pecially the regular. It is computed that the Franci&s;cans, Capuchins, and Servites, have no le&s;s than &s;eventy-five convents.</P>
<P>The principal rivers of the i&s;land are the Limone, Talavo, Tavignano, and Gollo. The others are the Ficario, Capitello, and Fuminale d'Ornano. The chief lakes are tho&s;e of Crena, Ino, Diana, Vibino, and Cova&s;ino. Of the mountains, which are very numerous, that called Monte Gradacio is the mo&s;t con&s;iderable.</P>
<P>The &s;trenuous efforts that have been made for a number of years, by the natives of this i&s;land, to recover their liberty from the Genoe&s;e, have, in a con&s;iderable degree, attracted the attention of the other nations of Europe.</P>
<P>The i&s;land, after a continual &s;eries of revolu|lutions, was at length granted by one of the popes to the republic of Pi&s;a, from whom the Genoe&s;e wre&s;ted it about the beginning of the fourteenth century. The conduct of the Genoe&s;e was &s;o cruel and arbitrary, that the Cor&s;icans at la&s;t &s;hook off their yoke; and, in the &s;ixteenth centry, car|ried on a bloody and de&s;perate war &s;everal years, but were at length obliged to &s;ubmit to their old ma&s;ters.</P>

About the year 1729 they again took up arms; and, from that time to the pre&s;ent, peace has never been thoroughly e&s;tabli&s;hed; though there have been &s;ome intervals of tranquility, procured by the help of foreign forces, Germans, Swi&s;s, or French.</P>
<P>In 1767, the French king bought of Genoa the claim of that republic in the i&s;land of Cor&s;ica; and in 1768, &s;ent a con&s;iderable force to reduce it. By the late&s;t accounts from thence, the count de Vaux, the French general, had made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of Corte, the chief town next to Ba&s;tia, and of almo&s;t all the re&s;t of the i&s;land; &s;o that general Paoli, with his brother Clement, and &s;ome other chiefs, had quitted the i&s;land, and retired to Leghorn.</P>
<P>The celebrated general Paoli is the &s;on of Gia|cinto Paoli, a Cor&s;ican chief, whom Giafferi, who was then at the head of the Cor&s;icans, cho&s;e for his colleague in 1734. In 1739 the French troops, under the marquis de Maillebois, having reduced the whole i&s;land, Giafferi and Paoli were obliged to quit the i&s;land, to which they never returned; they retired to Naples, where they got regiments, and &s;pent the remainder of their lives. While Gia|cinto Paoli led a retired life in Naples, his whole time was devoted to the education of his &s;on, who&s;e genius and di&s;po&s;ition were &s;o happy, that no part of it was mi&s;pent. The French troops having been withdrawn from Cor&s;ica, the inhabitants again took up arms; but tired at la&s;t of the continual di&s;|&s;entions among their principal men, and of the con&s;equent evils that attended them; charmed be|&s;ides with the character and manners of young Paoli, they &s;ent a deputation, in the year 1755, to in|vite him to Cor&s;ica, and to offer him the &s;upreme government of the i&s;land. This offer was gladly accepted, and ever &s;ince he has had the direction of their affairs, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by a council, con&s;i&s;ting of two members for every pari&s;h, who were elected annually.</P>

<P>This i&s;land, which lies about one hundred and fifty miles we&s;t of Leghorn, is near one hundred and &s;ixty in length from north to &s;outh, and eighty in breadth from ea&s;t to we&s;t.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the air it is not reckoned very who $$ome, e&s;pecially in the &s;outhern parts of the i&s;land, which are much more low and level, and fuller of mora&s;&s;es than the northern; where are high, rocky, barren mountains, and where con|&s;equently the air is more &s;harp and pure. The &s;oil, where it is properly cultivated, is very fruitful, pro|ducing corn, wine, and oil, in great plenty, to|gether with citrons, oranges, che&s;nuts, pears, plums, &amp;c. The other products of the i&s;land are cattle, large and &s;mall, game of all &s;orts, buffa|loes, wild bears, and dear. Of the la&s;t, &s;ome of the &s;kins are &s;o finely &s;potted, that they might be taken for tho&s;e of tigers.

The only venemous creature &s;aid to be in the i&s;land is the ma&s;&s;rone or ma&s;trione, a kind of &s;pi|der, re&s;embling a little frog, and by the antients called &s;olifuga, becau&s;e it keeps generally within the bowels of the earth: nor is there, as we are told, any ravenous wild bea&s;t in it, be&s;ides the fox.</P>
<P>In the&s;e commodities, and in coral, linen, &s;ilk, wool, hides, and a fine &s;ort of chee&s;e, a con&s;ider|able traffic is carried on, for which there are many fine harbours round the i&s;land, and in which, as well as agriculture, great improvements might be made, if the inhabitants were not &s;o indolent.</P>
<P>After having been &s;ucce&s;&s;ively &s;ubject to the Phenicians, Greeks, Carthagenians, Romans, Sar|racens, Genoe&s;e, and Pi&s;ans, the i&s;land was at la&s;t &s;ubdued by the king of Arragon, on whom the pope had be&s;towed it, anno 1297. From that time it continued annexed to the crown of Spain, until 1708, when it was reduced by the allies, and at the peace of Utrecht given to the emperor. In a few years after the Spaniards recovered it, but &s;oon after lo&s;t it again, namely in 1719, when it was conferred, in lieu of Sicily, on the duke of Savoy, with the title of king, who&s;e &s;on at pre&s;ent enjoys it.</P>
<P>The rivers Sacro, and Tir&s;o, by an oppo&s;ite cour&s;e, cut it nearly into two equal parts or pro|vinces called, the one Il Capo de Cagliari, and the other Il Capo de Sa&s;&s;ari, or Lugedori. There are a great many ports, gulphs, and bays in it, with &s;everal &s;trong towns, a great number of vil|lages, three archbi&s;hoprics, and four bi&s;hoprics. The clergy, both &s;ecular and regular, have great privileges, incomes, and immunities. The only univer&s;ity is that of Cagliari. The revenues of the i&s;land are &s;aid &s;carce to exceed the charges of the government.</P>

With re&s;pect to character, the Sardinians make no great figure, being repre&s;ented as proud, though poor, bruti&s;h, lazy, and ignorant: but &s;uppo&s;ing this character ju&s;t, may it not in a great mea&s;ure be owing to the tyranny, civil and eccle&s;ia&s;tical, under which they have long groaned? The clergy and nobility enjoy &s;uch exorbitant privi|leges, and in con&s;equence thereof are become &s;o arrogant and numerous, that the whole burden of public taxes falls upon the people of the lower rank. All the nobility are not only exempted from taxes, but from being tried for any crime, that of trea&s;on not excepted, by any but a council of &s;even of their peers. Thus, while the noble&s;&s;e riot in wealth and luxury, and are almo&s;t inde|pendent, the lower ranks of the people are in the mo&s;t deplorable &s;tate of &s;lavery and indigence. No mea&s;ures appear to have been taken, either by their former or pre&s;ent ma&s;ters, to remedy the&s;e abu&s;es, to encourage agriculture and commerce, and to make the mo&s;t of the natural advantages of the i&s;land. The degeneracy and depravity of the people, therefore, are not much to be wondered at, nor ought they to be a&s;cribed to a natural per|ver&s;ene&s;s, &s;o much as to oppre&s;&s;ion and thraldom.</P>
<P>The religion here is the Roman catholic, and the language the Spani&s;h; the i&s;land having been long under the dominion of Spain. The towns of any note in the i&s;land are,</P>
<P>Cagliari, which is commonly reckoned the ca|pital, and gives name not only to a province, but likewi&s;e to a gulph and promontory in its neighbour|hood. It &s;tands on the declivity of a hill on the &s;outh &s;ide of the i&s;land, and is divided into High and Low; the former of which is hand&s;ome and well built, but the latter, which &s;tands by the &s;ea-&s;hore, is dirty, unhealthy, and poorly inhabited. The king's vice-roy re&s;ides here, and an archbi|&s;hop,

<P>Ori&s;tagni, antiently U&s;ellis Colonia, &s;ituated on a gulph, on the we&s;t coa&s;t of the i&s;land. The town took its name from its &s;ituation near a lake, formed by the river Sacro. It is the &s;ee of an archbi&s;hop, but being &s;urrounded on the land|&s;ide with mar&s;hy grounds and &s;tagnated waters, it is very unhealthy, and for that rea&s;on but poorly inhabited. On the coa&s;t of the gulph, to which the town gives name, and which, notwith&s;tanding &s;everal rivers fall into it, is very &s;hallow, &s;tands a hand&s;ome light-hou&s;e. This town is about forty-five miles north of Cagliari.</P>
<P>Sa&s;&s;ari, a pretty large town on the river Torres, about ten miles from the north coa&s;t of the i&s;land. It hath &s;ome fortifications, and is the &s;ee of an archbi&s;hop, tran&s;lated hither, anno 1441, from the antient Turritana.</P>
<P>Ca&s;tel Arragone&s;e, Ca&s;trum Arragonen&s;e, a &s;mall but well fortified and inhabited town, with a good ca&s;tle, and a commodious and &s;pacious harbour, at the mouth of the river Coquinas, on the north-ea&s;t coa&s;t of the i&s;le.

About Sardinia lie a great many &s;maller i&s;lands, of which the principal are, St. Pietro, St. Anti|ocho, La Vacca, Il Toro, Ro&s;&s;a, Bovaria, Tavo|lats, A&s;inaria, Serpentera, Tazzo, Carbonera, and Ogi$a&s;tro. A&s;inaria, the mo&s;t con&s;iderable of the&s;e, by the antients &s;tiled the great i&s;land of Hercules, is about twenty-eight miles in compa&s;s, and lies about four miles from Cape Monte Falcone, and fif|teen north of the city of Sa&s;&s;ari.</P>
<P>In the Tu&s;can &s;ea, be&s;ides the Elba or Elva, be|longing to the principality of Piomberio, and al|ready de&s;cribed, are &s;everal &s;mall i&s;lands, belonging to the duchy, namely Melora, Gorgona, Piano&s;a, Le Formiche, Monte Chri&s;to, Giglio, and Gia|nuti.</P>
<P>In the &s;ame &s;ea is the i&s;land of Capraria, de|pending on Cor&s;ica, which is about eight miles in compa&s;s, and, though mountainous, well cultivated and inhabited, having a pretty large town in it, and a ca&s;tle.</P>
<P>On the coa&s;t of the Eccle&s;ia&s;tical State, fifteen miles &s;outh of Cape Cercella, is the &s;mall i&s;le of Ponza, antiently Pontia and Pontiae. It is fertile, and well cultivated.</P>
<P>On the we&s;tern coa&s;t of the kingdom of Naples, and belonging thereto, are the &s;mall i&s;lands of Ca|pri or Caprea, I&s;chia, Procita, and Ni&s;ida.</P>
<P>Capri, or Caprea, is much taken notice of for the noble ruins on it. It is about four miles long, and one broad, and is &s;ituated at the entrance of the Gulph of Naples, about three miles from the con|tinent. This i&s;le was the re&s;idence of the emperor Augu&s;tus, for &s;ome time; and afterwards of Ti|berius, for many years. The principal ruins and re|mains of antiquity are at the extremity of the ea&s;tern promontory. What chiefly recommended this i&s;land to Tiberius was its temperate healthful air, being warm in winter, and cool in &s;ummer; and the na|ture
<PB N="473" REF="4800">
of its coa&s;t, which is &s;o very &s;teep, that a &s;mall number of men may defend it again&s;t a great army. The &s;urface of the i&s;land was then cut into ea&s;y a&s;cents, adorned with the emperor's and other pa|laces, and planted with a variety of groves and gar|dens. The rocks al&s;o underneath, were cut into highways, grottos, galleries, bagnios, and &s;ubterra|neous retirements, which &s;uited the brutal plea&s;ures of that emperor; and were afterwards defaced or de|moli&s;hed by the Romans, in dete&s;tation of the la&s;ci|vious unnatural &s;cenes which had been acted there. It contains about fifteen hundred inhabitants, who are exempt from all taxes; and belongs to the pro|vince of Lovoro, in the kingdom of Naples. There are &s;everal &s;prings of fre&s;h water in it; and in a delightful valley between the mountains, at the two extremities, &s;tands a city of the &s;ame name with the i&s;land, which is the &s;ee of a bi&s;hop, who&s;e revenue ari&s;es chiefly from the prodigious flights of quails that come thither at certain &s;ea&s;ons, particu|larly in March, when va&s;t quantities of them are &s;ent to Naples, and &s;old for four-pence or five-pence per dozen. On this account, the bi&s;hopric is &s;ome|times joco&s;ely &s;tiled, the Bi&s;hopric of Quails.</P>
<P>I&s;chia, a &s;mall but plea&s;ant and fertile i&s;land, lying on the Neapolitan coa&s;t, about two miles from the Cape of Me&s;&s;ina, and twenty-five from Naples. Mo&s;t of it is &s;urrounded with high, craggy, and inacce&s;&s;ible rocks, which &s;helter it from the winds, and defend it from invaders. Some parts of it are rich and delightful, yielding all man|ner of delicious fruits, and excellent wines; but others are as di&s;mal and barren. It was antiently called Inarime; and was &s;o &s;ubject to earthquakes, that the poets tell us, Jupiter laid the vanqui&s;hed Titan Typhon under it, and that the earthquakes are occa&s;ioned by his efforts to throw off the load. There are &s;everal hot baths and medicinal waters in it, with a number of plea&s;ant towns and vil|lages,
<PB N="474" REF="4810">
churches and mona&s;teries. Of the moun|tains, one is called Falconaria, on account of the falcons that breed there; and another Guardia, be|cau&s;e a con&s;tant guard is kept on it, to prevent the landing of Cor&s;airs. The principal town has its name from the i&s;land, or the i&s;land from it, with the title of a bi&s;hopric, and is defended by a &s;trong fort.</P>
<P>The &s;mall i&s;le of Procita, which belongs to the marquis of Va&s;to, produces plenty of fruit and good wine, and is well inhabited.</P>
<P>Ni&s;ida, which lies not far from the main land, is a kind of large garden, laid out in &s;lopes and ter|races. Towards the &s;outh it has a &s;mall harbour; and, on a neighbouring rock, is a lazaretta, where &s;hips bound to Naples are obliged to perform qua|rantine.</P>
<P>On the ea&s;tern coa&s;t of Naples are al&s;o four or five &s;mall i&s;lands belonging to it. The whole groupe is known by the name of Tremiti, or Tre|mita, and lie about thirteen miles north-ea&s;t from the city of $remoli, in the Hither Abruzzo. The mo&s;t con&s;iderable, called St. Maria de Tremiti, is &s;trongly fortified, being &s;urrounded with high walls, flanked with towers, and four &s;tout ba&s;tions. There is a town in it, con&s;i&s;ting of a neat well built &s;treet, a quarter of a mile long, with a port commanded by a high &s;trong tower, a &s;mall ar&s;enal for the rig|ging of &s;hips, and a magnificent mona&s;tery. Dio|medes, after having abandoned Italy, is &s;aid to have retired to this i&s;land, and died in it; whence, the whole groupe was antiently called Diomedeae In|fulae. All &s;hips that pa&s;s by it commonly &s;alute the fort, or rather the church, and the miraculous images in it. The other i&s;les are more properly huge rocks than i&s;lands. There is &s;aid to be an odd kind of birds peculiar to the&s;e i&s;les, and by the antients called Diomedean birds, having teeth, with
<PB N="475" REF="4820">
white feathers all over, and eyes of the colour of fire. They have always two chiefs; of which one leads the van, and the other brings up the rear.</P>

<HEAD>SICILY.</HEAD>
<P>This i&s;land, by far the mo&s;t con&s;iderable in the Mediterranean, was antiently known by &s;everal names; as tho&s;e of Trinacria and Triquetra, from its triangular form; and Sicania and Sicilia, from the Sicani and Siculi, its antient inhabitants: the la&s;t of the&s;e names it retains to this day. It is di|vided from Italy by the narrow &s;trait, now called the Strait of Me&s;&s;ina, and in Italian Il Faro de Me&s;&s;ina, or Il Canale, but antiently Fretum Secu|lum, which, where narrowe&s;t, is not above three miles broad. This &s;trait was much dreaded an|tiently, on account of its rocks, currents, and whirlpool. The tides here flow very irregularly, and generally with great violence, both from the Tu&s;can and Sicilian &s;eas. The rocky promontory antiently called Scylla, and now Capo Sciglio, is on the Calabrian &s;ide of the &s;trait, oppo&s;ite the Capo de Faro, in Sicily, the Promontorium Pelorum of the antients: the di&s;tance between the&s;e is not a|bove three Italian miles. The whirlpool, antiently called Charybdis, and now Calo&s;ara and La Rema, lies not far from Me&s;&s;ina, near the bottom of the cape, and &s;eems now to be little dreaded.</P>
<P>Though this country lies in a warm climate, the air is healthful, being refre&s;hed with &s;ea-breezes on every &s;ide. Antiently its fertility was &s;uch, that it was &s;tiled the granary or &s;tore-hou&s;e of Italy; nor has it yet lo&s;t its glory in this re&s;pect, producing, in great abundance, corn, wine, oil, fruits, &s;ugar, honey, wax, &s;affron, and &s;ilk. Here are al&s;o &s;ome mines of gold, &s;ilver, iron, and other metals, with &s;everal kinds of minerals, as alum, vitriol, &s;altpetre,
<PB N="476" REF="4830">
and mineral &s;alt. The mountains yield al&s;o eme|ralds, ja&s;per, agate, porphyry, lapis lazuli, and a &s;tone called catochite, of a greeni&s;h &s;peckled co|lour, which is &s;aid to grow &s;oft by the warmth of one's hand, &s;ticking to it like glew, and to be an excellent antidote again&s;t the &s;ting of &s;corpions, and &s;ome other poi&s;onous in&s;ects. A good deal of coral is found upon the coa&s;t, and plenty of excel|lent fi&s;h; among which are the pe&s;ce &s;pada, or &s;word-fi&s;h, and tunnies.</P>
<P>Of the&s;e commodities, particularly &s;ilk, raw or manufactured, great quantities are exported from Me&s;&s;ina, where a con&s;ul from almo&s;t every nation in Europe re&s;ides, to manage and protect the trade of his nation; and, of late years, the Sicilians have traded with Turky and the coa&s;t of Barbary, which they never did before Don Carlos, now king of Spain, a&s;cended the throne of the Two Sicilies.</P>
<P>Here are &s;everal rivers and good &s;prings; but few of the rivers are navigable, having but a &s;hort cour&s;e, and de&s;cending precipitately from the mountains. The chief are the Cantera, the Jar|retta, and the Sal&s;o; of which, the two former run from we&s;t to ea&s;t, and the third from north to &s;outh.</P>
<P>Of the mountains in this i&s;land the mo&s;t noted is Mount Aetna, now called Monte Gibello, or Mon|gibello, a vulcano, who&s;e eruptions have often proved fatal to the neighbouring country. It is &s;aid to be &s;eventy miles in circuit, and &s;o high, that a circle of &s;now lies round the mouth of the vulca|no a great part of the year: the circumference of the mouth is &s;aid to be &s;ix miles. Of its erup|tions, that which happened in 1694 was one of the mo&s;t fatal; for the city of Catanea, &s;ituated at the foot of it, together with all the adjacent country, were well nigh de&s;troyed by it. Its &s;ides are all co|vered, either with vines, olive-trees, or &s;hrubs,
<PB N="477" REF="4840">
which harbour many wild-bea&s;ts. At the bottom are corn-fields, and plantations of &s;ugar-canes. Among the other mountains, one of the mo&s;t con|&s;iderable is Mount St. Julian, near Palermo, an|tiently called Eryx, and now vulgarly Trepani. The eruptions of Mount Aetna are generally pre|ceded by an earthquake, which often do more da|mage than the eruptions.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t inhabitants of the i&s;land are &s;aid to have been the Lae&s;trigones and Cyclopes; the&s;e were &s;ucceeded by the Iberi, from Spain, under their king Sicanus, from whom the i&s;land was named Sicania; the&s;e again by the Siculi, from Italy; then came the Phaenicians, from Tyre and Sidon; and then the Greeks, who were &s;oon after obliged to &s;hare it with the Carthaginians: but both the&s;e were &s;ubdued or expelled by the Ro|mans, who reduced it into the form of a province, and to whom, by its great fertility, it became a kind of granary. It followed the fortune of Italy in its &s;everal revolutions, until the Sicilian Ve&s;pers, in 1282, when the natives ma&s;&s;acred the French, who had then the dominion of the i&s;land: the Spaniards then got po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it, and held it till 1707, when they were expelled by the Imperiali&s;ts; but, at the peace of Utrecht, Sicily was ceded to the duke of Savoy, with the title of king. The Spaniards invaded it in 1718, but were forced to abandon it again; and then it was conferred on the emperor Charles VI. who held it till the year 1735, when the Imperiali&s;ts were driven out of this i&s;land and all their Italian dominions, and Don Carlos, now king of Spain, was advanced to the throne of the Two Sicilies, (Naples and Sicily) which were confirmed to him by a &s;ub&s;equent peace, on condi|tion of his relinqui&s;hing Milan, Parma, and all the re&s;t of the emperor's Italian dominions, which the Spaniards and French had taken from him during
<PB N="478" REF="4850">
the war. Don Carlos &s;ucceeding to the crown of Spain upon the death of his half-brother, without i&s;|&s;ue, his third &s;on, Ferdinand, became king of the Two Sicilies, who is no le&s;s ab&s;olute here than in his other dominions, and his revenues are what he plea&s;es to make them. While Sicily was immedi|ately &s;ubject to Spain, it was governed by a vice|roy &s;ent thither, who received from thence a reve|nue of above four millions of crowns; but &s;ince it hath, jointly with Naples, been erected into a king|dom, under the name of the Two Sicilies, the face of affairs, as well as form of government, is &s;aid to be much altered, tho' it is to be feared, not much in favour of the inhabitants. The nobility are &s;o numerous in this i&s;land, that Labat &s;ays, it is paved with noblemen; there being no le&s;s than &s;ixty dukedoms, fifty-&s;ix marqui&s;ates, and upwards of an hundred earldoms, be&s;ides a great number of baronies.</P>
<P>This people, with re&s;pect to their character, are far from appearing in a favourable light; being repre&s;ented as a perver&s;e race, which mu&s;t be kept under with a high hand, according to an old pro|verb, <HI>In&s;ulani plerumq. mali, Seculi autem omnium pe&s;|&s;imi.</HI> They are a mixture of Italians and Spani|ards; but &s;peak chiefly Spani&s;h, and follow the Spani&s;h fa&s;hions, particularly in wearing black.</P>
<P>The e&s;tabli&s;hed religion of the i&s;land is the Ro|man catholic. The Jews are now allowed to &s;ettle here, and make open profe&s;&s;ion of their religion, which was not the ca&s;e while the i&s;land was imme|diately &s;ubject to Spain. The number of churches, convents, and religious foundations here, is very great, and they are well endowed. There is a &s;o|vereign-tribunal, which judges in all eccle&s;ia&s;tical affairs, and admits of no appeal to the pope.</P>
<P>The i&s;land is commonly divided into three parts or provinces, viz. Val di Demino, Val di Noto, and Val di Mazara.</P>
<P><PB N="479" REF="4860">
The fir&s;t of the&s;e begins at the Cape of Pharo, antiently called Promontorium Pelorum, and is of a con&s;iderable extent, being bounded on the &s;outh by the river Jarreta, and on the we&s;t by that of Ter|mini or Torto, called al&s;o Fiume Grande, or the Great River. The principal places in it are,</P>
<P>Me&s;&s;ina, a large well built city, with a &s;pacious harbour, near the &s;trait to which it gives name, and not above &s;ix miles from the coa&s;t of Calabria. It is one of the greate&s;t mart-towns in the Mediter|ranean, contains many noble edifices, is the &s;ee of an archbi&s;hop, and contends with Palermo for being the capital of the i&s;land. The cathedral is a large &s;pacious building, very rich in plate, and finely adorned in the in&s;ide. In the magnificent chapel of the Virgin Mary is pre&s;erved, as a choice relick, a letter, which, the Me&s;&s;inians tell us, was &s;ent them by the Ble&s;&s;ed Virgin, and which is carried in proce&s;&s;ion, once a-year, with great pomp. The other buildings mo&s;t worthy of notice are the arch|bi&s;hop's palace, the general ho&s;pital, called La Log|gio, the Lazaretto, and forts. At the annual fair, kept here in Augu&s;t, great quantities of foreign goods are expo&s;ed to &s;ale. The city lies on a gen|tle declivity along the &s;ea, has large &s;uburbs, and is well furni&s;hed with water by &s;ubterraneous aque|ducts, and all kinds of provi&s;ions, from &s;ea and land. The port, which was declared a free one in 1728, is of an oblong oval form, well fortified, with a citadel, and other works, and &s;o deep, that &s;hips of eighty guns can come clo&s;e up to the key. The city al&s;o is &s;trongly fortified, though not regularly. In its neighbourhood are &s;ome hot mineral waters, e&s;teemed very good again&s;t all rheumatic di&s;ea&s;es. The chief manufacture of this place is that of &s;ilks: &s;ome of the inhabitants are al&s;o employed in fi&s;hing, cultivating vines and mulberry-trees, and breeding &s;ilk-worms. It was almo&s;t depopulated

<P>Catanea, &s;ituated on a gulph of its own name, near the mouth of the river Indicello, but no &s;ea|port. By its vicinity to Mount Aetna, it had &s;uf|fered greatly before the year 1693, when mo&s;t part of it was de&s;troyed by an eruption, attended with an earthquake of three days continuance. Eleven hundred people that had taken refuge in the cathe|dral were buried under the ruins of it. The town, however, notwith&s;tanding the danger to which it is expo&s;ed, is &s;aid to be now pretty well rebuilt. There is a great fair here in the &s;pring, that brings in a va&s;t concour&s;e of people from all parts of Ita|ly, but e&s;pecially from Malta, which hath mo&s;t of its provi&s;ions and other commodities from this place. This town is the &s;ee of a bi&s;hop, under the archbi&s;hop of Mont Real, and &s;tands forty-&s;ix miles from Syracu&s;e to the north, and forty from Me&s;&s;ina to the &s;outh-we&s;t.</P>
<P>Cefalu, antiently Cephalaedis or Cephaledium, a &s;mall but well peopled town, and an epi&s;copal &s;ee, with a good port, thirty-two miles ea&s;t of Paler|mo, and eighty-four we&s;t of Me&s;&s;ina.</P>
<P>Milazzo, antiently Mylae, &s;ituated on the gulph of its name, and reckoned one of the &s;tronge&s;t places in the i&s;land.

<P>Taormina, antiently Taurominium, a &s;mall town, &s;tanding near the &s;ea, on a rocky mountain called formerly Taurus, and much celebrated for its ex|cellent wine and marble.</P>
<P>The province called Val di Noto extends from the Jarretta to the &s;outh-ea&s;t coa&s;t of the i&s;land. The principal places contained in it are,</P>

Syracu&s;e, antiently a very noble city, and the ca|pital of the i&s;land, &s;aid to have been built by Ar|chias, a Corinthian, and to have extended upwards of twenty-two miles, or an hundred and eighty &s;ta|dia, in compa&s;s. It &s;tands forty-&s;ix miles from Ca|tania, &s;eventy-five from Me&s;&s;ina to the &s;outh, and thirty eight north from Capo Pa&s;&s;aro, the Promon|torium Pachynum of the Romans, on that &s;pot an|tiently called In&s;ula, or the I&s;land. Syracu&s;e is pret|ty well fortified, and has a port, capable of receiv|ing the large&s;t ve&s;&s;els, with a &s;trong ca&s;tle, &s;upplied with plenty of water by the fountain of Arethu&s;a, &s;o famed among the antients.</P>
<P>Ca&s;tro Giovanni, antiently Enna or Henna, and a celebrated city. It &s;tands near the heart of the i&s;land, to the north-we&s;t of the lake Pergus, &s;ixty miles &s;outh-ea&s;t from Palermo, and is now a &s;mall, but hand&s;ome city, defended by an old ca&s;tle. Near it is a cavern, which is &s;uppo&s;ed to be bottomle&s;s, whence, as the poets feigned, Pluto came out in his car, and carried off Pro&s;erpine.</P>
<P>Terra Nova, a &s;mall town, by &s;ome thought to be the Gela of the antients. There is a &s;alt-lake belonging to it, called Il Beviero di Terra Nova, about three miles in circumference, which is &s;o full of fi&s;h, that one may kill them with a &s;tick along the &s;hore; but two per&s;ons are ap|pointed to keep watch from a tower, to prevent the fi&s;h from being thus de&s;troyed. The inhabi|tants fi&s;h chiefly in Lent, and furni&s;h both them|&s;elves and all the neighbouring parts. The banks of the lake are covered with &s;alt, yet it has no vi|&s;ible communication with the &s;ea.</P>
<P>Lentino, Lentini, or Leontini, now a con&s;ider|able town, notwith&s;tanding it &s;uffered greatly by the earthquake in 1693, &s;tanding about five miles from the bay of Catana, and twenty north of Sy|racu&s;e, at a &s;mall di&s;tance from a lake, called an|tiently Lacus Herculeus, and now Lago di Lentini.</P>

<P>The province called Val di Mazara, lies on the we&s;tern &s;ide of the i&s;land, and is bounded by the &s;ea, except on the ea&s;t, where it borders on the Val di Demino, and the ea&s;t and &s;outh-ea&s;t, where it terminates on that of Noto. Though mountainous, it is fertile and well watered. The principal towns in it are,</P>
<P>Mazara, which gives name to it, and &s;tands near the mouth of a river of the &s;ame name, to the ea&s;t of Cape Faro. It was formerly a con&s;ider|able city, but is now much fallen from its pri&s;tine grandeur.</P>
<P>Palermo, antiently Panormus, and Panormum, a large, rich, and well-built city, &s;ituated at the very bottom of a gulph, to which it gives name. It is &s;aid to have been built by the Phaenicians, at their fir&s;t coming into Sicily; and it is now an archiepi&s;copal &s;ee, laying claim al&s;o, as we ob&s;erved above, to the title of capital, as well as Me&s;&s;ina, from which it is one hundred and twenty miles di&s;tant, to the we&s;t. The vice-roy's palace is a mag|nificent &s;tructure, adorned with fine &s;culptures, gardens, &amp;c. and &s;erves in&s;tead of a ca&s;tle, &s;tand|ing high, and being flanked with &s;ome lofty towers, and other works. There are many other fine pub|lic edifices, as the cathedral, and the other church|es, &s;everal fountains, the city gate, which leads to the &s;ea-&s;ide, the key, mole, forts, and the convents, town-hou&s;e, lombard-hou&s;e, and univer&s;ity. The key is one of the fine&s;t walks about the city, being wide and of a great length, and planted with trees. The port is &s;afe and commodious every where, except on the &s;outh-we&s;t &s;ide, which is full of rocks, that ri&s;e no higher than the &s;urface of the &s;ea.

<P>Trepani, antiently Drepanum, &s;ituated forty miles &s;outh-we&s;t of Palermo, at the foot of the hill, antiently called Eryx, and now II Monte di Tra|pani, on the top of which was formerly a city called Eryx, a temple of Venus, and Anchi&s;es's tomb. Trapani is &s;aid to be a place of great trade, and is noted for its &s;alt-&s;prings, and works, and its fi&s;heries, e&s;pecially that of coral.</P>
<P>Mar&s;ala, a well fortified town, with a good haven, eighteen miles &s;outh of Trapani, and fifty-&s;ix &s;outh-we&s;t of Palermo. Its &s;ituation is &s;up|po&s;ed to be the &s;ame as that of the antient Lily|baeum, which gave name to the neighbouring cape, called &s;till Capo Lilibeo, though more frequently Capo di Bono, or Mar&s;ala.</P>
<P>Gergenti, a town &s;ituated on the river St. Bla&s;io, about four miles from the &s;ea, and &s;ixty-&s;ix &s;outh from Palermo. It is an epi&s;copal &s;ee, has a con|&s;iderable traffic, e&s;pecially in corn; and though &s;trong by nature, is al&s;o defended by a ca&s;tle. Near it antiently &s;tood the city called, by the Ro|mans, Agrigentum, and, by the Greeks, Agragas, and &s;aid to have been ten miles in compa&s;s. Hi&s;tory informs us, that its tyrant Phalaris u&s;ed to torture people in a brazen-bull, made by one Perillus, who, for his reward, had the fir&s;t experiment made upon him&s;elf.</P>

to have had its name from Liparus, the founder of its capital. By the Latins they were antiently deno|minated Aeoliae and Vulcaniae, and by the Greeks Hephae&s;tiades. The fir&s;t of the&s;e names they are &s;uppo&s;ed to have had from Aeolus, the &s;ucce&s;&s;or of Liparus, whom the poets &s;tyled the God of the winds, on account of the high winds that reign in the&s;e parts, and the &s;econd from the volcanos that are in two of them, viz. Hiera and Stromboli. Lipari, which lies about twenty-&s;ix miles north from the neare&s;t coa&s;t of Sicily, and is about eigh|teen miles in circumference, including the wind|ings of the &s;hore, enjoys a whole&s;ome air, and rich &s;oil, producing corn, wine, and fruit, e&s;pe|cially figs and rai&s;ins, in great plenty, together with &s;ulphur, alum, and bitumen. It hath al&s;o &s;ome excellent hot &s;prings, and on the coa&s;ts are caught a great variety of fine fi&s;h, with which it drives a con&s;iderable commerce. The capital, called al&s;o Lipari, is &s;trong both by nature and art, well inhabited, and an epi&s;copal &s;ee, under that of Me&s;|&s;ina.

<HEAD>The ISLAND of MALTA.</HEAD>
<P>Malta, Olim Melita, lying but a little to the &s;outh of Sicily, we &s;hall cla&s;s among the Italian i&s;lands.

The air is clear and healthful, but exce&s;&s;ive hot, when it is not cooled by the &s;ea|breezes. It is all a white &s;oft rock, covered to the depth of a foot with a good vegetable earth, pro|ducing great quantities of cotton, indigo, oranges, lemons, olives, figs, and other fruits, with plenty of honey, good pa&s;ture, pul&s;e, roots, herbs, and
<PB N="485" REF="4920">
garden &s;tuff, but not a &s;ufficient quantity of corn, wine, or wood, for the con&s;umption of the inhabi|tants, who are computed at about &s;ixty thou&s;and, and &s;peak commonly a corrupt Arabic in the coun|try, but in the towns Italian. Con&s;iderable fi&s;heries are carried on here, particularly of coral, and large quantities of &s;ea-&s;alt made along the coa&s;t.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t antient inhabitants of this i&s;land, of whom we have any account, were the Phaeacians, who were driven out by the Phaenicians, and they, in their turn, by the Greeks. Afterwards it &s;eems to have been under the dominion of the Carthagini|ans, from whom the Romans took it. Upon the declen&s;ion of the Roman empire, it was fir&s;t &s;ub|dued by the Goths, then by the Saracens, from whom it was wre&s;ted by the Normans, in the year 1090, after which it had the &s;ame ma&s;ters as Sicily, till Charles V. gave it to the knights of St. John of Jeru&s;alem.</P>
<P>This order took its ri&s;e in the Holy Land, in the eleventh century. After the alliance entered into between the Greek emperor Con&s;tantine Monachus, and the Saracen caliphs, great numbers of we&s;tern Europeans re&s;orting to the Holy Land, &s;ome Italian merchants, for the accommodation of pilgrims, built an ho&s;pital and oratory at Jeru&s;alem, which they dedicated to St. John the Bapti&s;t, and appointed certain monks to attend on the pilgrims, who, from their office, were &s;tiled ho&s;pitalers, or ho&s;pi|tal brothers, and from the church of St. John, Jo|hannites. At fir&s;t the&s;e merchants and ho&s;pitalers furni&s;hed them&s;elves with all nece&s;&s;aries from Italy; but Godfrey of Bouillon, upon his conque&s;t of the Holy Land, in which they performed &s;ignal &s;ervice, having endowed them with &s;ome lands, and his &s;ucce&s;&s;or Baldwin having put them in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of &s;everal ca&s;tles and towns, they thereupon held a general chapter, and elected Raymond de Podio for ma&s;ter, who fir&s;t in&s;tituted an order out of the

brotherhood, made them take vows of cha&s;tity, poverty, and obedience, gave them the octangular cro&s;s, and the black cloak, and al&s;o divided them into three cla&s;&s;es, namely, knights, capellane, or chaplains, and &s;erventi d' armi, i. e. &s;ervants, or &s;erjeants at arms. All this happened towards the clo&s;e of the eleventh century, and was confirmed by the pope. The&s;e knights maintained their ground in Syria and the Holy Land again&s;t all the efforts of the Turks, for the &s;pace of two hundred years; but being at la&s;t compelled to quit them, they re|tired to Cyprus, and afterwards made them&s;elves ma&s;ters of the i&s;land of Rhodes, which they al&s;o defended, for two hundred years, again&s;t all the power of the infidels; and then &s;urrendering it upon honourable terms, withdrew to Candia, and then to Italy, till Charles V. in 1529, conferred on them the i&s;lands of Malta and Gozo upon the fol|lowing conditions: Fir&s;t, That they wage war continually with the Turks, and all cor&s;airs or powers of that nation or religion. Secondly, That they promi&s;e upon oath that the kingdom of Spain &s;hall &s;uffer no detriment from the ceded countries. Thirdly, That the right of patronage to the bi|&s;hopric of Malta &s;hall continue in the king of Spain, as king of Sicily; but that he &s;hall always chu&s;e the bi&s;hop from among three per&s;ons, pre|&s;ented by the grand ma&s;ter. Fourthly, That an Italian &s;hall be captain of the gallies, and not a foreigner, whom the Spaniards may have rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect. Fifthly, That, whenever the order &s;hall become ma&s;ter of Rhodes, or tran&s;plant it&s;elf el&s;ewhere, the&s;e i&s;lands &s;hall revert to the king of Spain, as king of Sicily. And, &s;ixthly, That in acknowledgment of this tenure, the order, every year, on all &s;aints day, &s;hall &s;end a deputation, with a falcon to the vice-roy of Naples.</P>
<P>The knights con&s;i&s;t of eight tongues or nations, the chief of which are French, Italian, Spaniards,
<PB N="487" REF="4940">
Engli&s;h, and German. They have commanderies or e&s;tates in all or mo&s;t parts of the Roman catho|lic countries, and are &s;aid to amount to about three thou&s;and. They ought all to be of antient noble families; but &s;ometimes nobility is di&s;pen&s;ed with, on account of per&s;onal merit, and &s;uch are called cavalieri di gratia. Not only the grand-ma&s;ter, but the knights in general are capable of being ad|vanced to a cardinal's hat. According to the &s;ta|tutes, no natural children, tho&s;e of great princes excepted, nor per&s;ons under eighteen years of age, can be admitted into the order; but the pope may di&s;pen&s;e with the&s;e qualifications, and the grand|ma&s;ter has an unlimited privilege to grant this fa|vour to &s;ix per&s;ons.</P>
<P>The grand-ma&s;ter is &s;tiled by foreign princes, Alte&s;&s;e eminenti&s;&s;ime, by his &s;ubjects, mo&s;t &s;erene eminence, but, by the knights, only eminence. In matters relating to the order, he is accountable to his council and the chapter, but, in re&s;pect of the i&s;land and its inhabitants, he is entirely ab&s;olute. The principal among the high officers of the order are, the grand-commendeur, the mar&s;hal, the great ho&s;pitaler, the admiral, the gran-con&s;ervatore, the &s;ecretary, the great balley, and the turcopelier. The&s;e, &s;tiled ballivi conventuale, con&s;titute the grand|ma&s;ter's council, and are the heads of the eight tongues. Next follow the priories, of which the great priory of Germany holds the fir&s;t place. The grand-priors re&s;ide in the &s;everal Roman catholic nations, where there are commanderies, over which they pre&s;ide, being accounted the grand-ma&s;ter's vicars. They mu&s;t remit the nece&s;&s;ary contribu|tions for acting again&s;t the Turks. There are grand-ma&s;ter&s;hips of the order among Prote&s;tants, but they &s;end no remittances to Malta. The prin|cipal &s;tatute of the order, that each knight &s;hall a&s;&s;i&s;t at lea&s;t in three expeditions again&s;t the Turks, is not now &s;o &s;trictly ob&s;erved. The knights make
<PB N="488" REF="4950">
vows of celibacy and cha&s;tity; notwith&s;tanding which every man keeps as many concubines as he plea&s;es, who are for the mo&s;t part Grecian beauties, which they take in the i&s;lands of the Archipelago, &s;ubject to Turkey. They have a &s;quadron of men of war, and land forces, and are engaged in a per|petual war again&s;t the Turks, Algerines, and other Mahometan powers. The grand-ma&s;ter, who is the head of the order, and chief commander in the i&s;land, is elected by the grand-priors. When at home he u&s;ually wears a long black gown, made after a particular fa&s;hion, with the large golden key of the holy &s;epulchre hanging by his &s;ide; but on a journey he dre&s;&s;es him&s;elf in a lay-garb, and wears a &s;word.</P>
<P>Valetta, or Cittanuova, the capital of the i&s;land of Malta, had its name from the grand-ma&s;ter Fred. Joh. de Valetta, who built it anno 1566. It is a hand&s;ome town, with an excellent harbour, and &s;trongly fortified. Here is a hand&s;ome palace for the grand-ma&s;ter, &s;everal convents, nunneries, and churches, the principal of which is dedicated to St. John, a college of Je&s;uits, a large ho&s;pital, and a building where Turki&s;h &s;laves are kept. Of the other towns, the mo&s;t con&s;iderable are, Citta Vitto|rio&s;a, or Il Borgo, Senglea, Malta, called al&s;o Me|dina, and Citta Vecchia, where the bi&s;hop re|&s;ides, Bormola, Cittanuova, Cottonera, Forte di S. Thoma&s;&s;o, and Forte Ro&s;&s;o.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides Malta there are two other &s;mall i&s;lands lying near it, that belong to the order, namely, Gozo, antiently Gaulos, and Comino, antiently Hephae&s;tea. Gozo is very fruitful, and has about three thou&s;and inhabitants, with &s;everal good har|bours, and &s;trong forts. Comino, though very &s;mall, has a fort and harbour, and is pretty fertile.</P>
