<HEAD>TO THE
READER.</HEAD>
<P>IN this Collection of the Earl of <HI>Ro&s;co|mon</HI>'s
Poems, Care has been taken to in|&s;ert
all that I could po&s;&s;ibly procure that are
truly Genuine; there have been &s;everal Things
publi&s;hed under his Name which were written
by others, the Authors of which I could &s;et
down, if it were Material.</P>
<P>His E&s;&s;ay on Translated Ver&s;e has been very
much e&s;teem'd; it is from the Ingenious Pen
of Mr. <HI>Eu&s;den</HI> of <HI>Cambridge</HI> that you have the
Latin Ver&s;ion of it, which was never printed
before. That E&s;&s;ay begins with the&s;e two Lines:
<Q><L>Happy that Author, who&s;e correct E&s;&s;ay</L>
<L><HI>Repairs</HI> &s;o well our Old <HI>Horatian</HI> Way.</L></Q>
Where his Lord&s;hip refers to the E&s;&s;ay on
Poetry, written by a Noble Hand; and I
have, at the end of my Lord <HI>Ro&s;comon</HI>'s
Poems, printed that E&s;&s;ay with the Leave and
with the Corrections of the Author.</P>
<P><PB REF="4">
I was promis'd &s;ome Account of the Life
and Writings of the Earl of <HI>Ro&s;comon</HI> by a
Gentleman that was very intimately acquaint|ed
with his Lord&s;hip and his Writings; and but
for that Expectation this Collection had been
publi&s;h'd &s;ome Time &s;ince.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the&s;e Poems, he made, in the Year
1682, a Tran&s;lation of Dr. <HI>Sherlock</HI>'s Di&s;|cour&s;e
of Pa&s;&s;ive Obedience into <HI>French,</HI> at
the De&s;ire of the then Duke of <HI>Ormond,</HI>
which is printed in <HI>8vo.</HI></P>
<P>As for the Poems of the late Mr. <HI>Duke;</HI>
whatever has not been printed before, I have
of his own Hand-Writing, to &s;atisfy any Per|&s;on
that doubts of their being his.</P>
<P>The Beginning of the Poem, call'd the
<HI>Review,</HI> he wrote a little after the publi&s;hing
Mr. <HI>Dryden</HI>'s <HI>Ab&s;alom</HI> and <HI>Achitophel;</HI> he
was per&s;uaded to undertake it by Mr. <HI>She|ridan,</HI>
then Secretary to the Duke of <HI>York;</HI>
but Mr. <HI>Duke</HI> finding Mr. <HI>Sheridan</HI> de&s;ign'd
to make u&s;e of his Pen to vent his
Spleen again&s;t &s;everal Per&s;ons at Court
that were of another Party, than that he was
engaged in, broke off proceeding in it, and
left it as it is now printed.</P>

<HEAD>The ARGUMENT.</HEAD>
<Q><P>Two young Shepherds, <HI>Chromis</HI> and <HI>Mna&s;ylus,</HI> having been
often promis'd a Song by <HI>Silenus,</HI> chance to catch him
a&s;leep in this Eclogue; where they bind him Hand and
Foot, and then claim his Promi&s;e. <HI>Silenus</HI> finding they
wou'd be put off no longer, begins his Song; in which he
de&s;cribes the Formation of the Univer&s;e, and the Origi|nal
of Animals, according to the <HI>Epicurean</HI> Philo&s;ophy;
and then runs through the mo&s;t &s;urpri&s;ing Transformations
which have happen'd in Nature &s;ince her Birth. This
Eclogue was de&s;ign'd as a Complement to <HI>Syro</HI> the <HI>Epi|curean,</HI>
who in&s;tructed <HI>Virgil</HI> and <HI>Varus</HI> in the Princi|ples
of that Philo&s;ophy. <HI>Silenus</HI> acts as Tutor, <HI>Chro|mis</HI>
and <HI>Mna&s;ylus</HI> as the two Pupils.</P>
<P>My Aim being only to have <HI>Virgil</HI> under&s;tood by &s;uch who
do not under&s;tand <HI>Latin,</HI> and cannot (probably) be ac|quainted
with &s;ome Names and Pa&s;&s;ages of this Eclogue,
I have directed them by Figures to the <HI>Po&s;t&s;cript,</HI> where
they will find the be&s;t account that I can give, of all that
is out of the common Road.</P></Q>

<HEAD>REMARQUES on the foregoing
ODE,
To F&V;SC&V;S ARISTI&V;S.</HEAD>
<P><HI>HOrace</HI> writes to the &s;ame <HI>Ari&s;tius Fu&s;cus,</HI> to whom he
addre&s;s'd the Tenth Epi&s;tle of the Fir&s;t Book. He was
a Rhetorician, Grammarian and Poet. There is not any thing
in this Ode by which one may make a Conjecture in what time
it was made; but if this <HI>Lalage</HI> is the &s;ame with her in the
Fifth Ode in the Second Book, of which I make no Doubt,
it mu&s;t have been written much later than the other. No
one has hitherto given any Light to this Pa&s;&s;age, let us &s;ee
what Conjecture can be made of it.</P>
<P><HI>Fu&s;cus Ari&s;tius</HI> was in Love with <HI>Lalage: Horace,</HI> who
was in a &s;trict League of Friend&s;hip with him, and who al&s;o
lov'd <HI>Lalage,</HI> but rather as the Friend of <HI>Ari&s;tius</HI> than as
his Rival, writes him an Account of an Adventure that
happen'd to him, in which <HI>Lalage</HI> had pre&s;erv'd him from
an eminent Danger, upon the account of his having &s;ung her
Prai&s;es. He attributes his Safety to this Mi&s;tre&s;s, whom he
looks upon as a Godde&s;s coming to his Succour, in reward for
tho&s;e Sentiments, as re&s;pectful as pa&s;&s;ionate, which he had
for her. This is the Rea&s;on he begins the Ode with de&s;cri|bing
his being innocent, and free from any vicious Intenti|ons.
This is making a great Compliment to <HI>Lalage,</HI> and at
the &s;ame time confirming the Friend&s;hip of his Rival, by
preventing his being jealous of him.</P>
<P>This Ode is &s;o Polite and Gallant, as never to be &s;uffici|ently
commended.</P>

there &s;o great a number of Lions and Tygers, that the
People were at la&s;t forc'd to abandon their Dwellings, and
the tilling of their Ground.</P>
<P><HI>Lin. 17. Pone me pigris.</HI> He means, There is no Place &s;o
&s;avage, nor &s;o hideous, that the Thoughts of his Mi&s;tre&s;s

who&s;e powerful Protection he has already experienc'd,
could not &s;end him Succour, and draw him out of all tho&s;e
Dangers which &s;hou'd threaten his Life. 'Tis on this Ac|count

be a certain Refuge for him in every Danger. In all the
Books of Chivalry there is nothing more gallant.</P>
<P><HI>Pigris campis.</HI> The&s;e four Ver&s;es admirably de&s;ign the two

<HEAD>REMARQUES
ON THE
Foregoing ODE.</HEAD>
<P>THis Ode is a Le&s;&s;on of Morality. <HI>Horace</HI> is per&s;wa|ding
the <HI>Romans,</HI> that Contempt of Religion, and
Corruption of Manners, were the &s;ole Cau&s;es of all the
Misfortunes which had befallen <HI>Rome.</HI> The time when it
was written was after the Defeat of <HI>Antony,</HI> about the
Year of <HI>Rome, DCCXXIV,</HI> or <HI>DCCXXV.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Lin. 1. Delicta majorum immeritus lues.</HI> The Pa|gans
had di&s;cover'd this Truth, That Po&s;terity might &s;uf|fer
for a Crime of their Ance&s;tors; and that 'till &s;uch
Crime was aton'd for, the Children of the Offenders were
liable to the Puni&s;hment due to their Crime.</P>
<P><HI>Lin. 2. Donec templa refeceris.</HI> He means the Tem|ples
which had been burn'd during the Wars. This points
at <HI>Augu&s;tus</HI> in particular: For that Prince was very dili|gent
in repairing the Temples which had been demoli&s;h'd or
burnt, and rai&s;ing them up again.</P>
<P><HI>Lin. 3. Aede&s;que labentes Deorum.</HI> The difference be|tween
the <HI>Aedes Sacra,</HI> and the Temple, was this; <HI>Aedes
Sacra</HI> was properly a Sacred Edifice dedicated to &s;ome Deity,
but without the Ceremony of the <HI>Augurs;</HI> a <HI>Temple</HI> was a
certain &s;pace of Ground &s;et apart by the <HI>Augurs,</HI> but not
hallowed nor con&s;ecrated to any of the Gods, as the <HI>Ro&s;tra,
Curia Pompeia, Curia Julia, Curia Ho&s;tilia.</HI> Hence it
<PB N="163" REF="182">
is no hard matter to conceive how one might be turn'd into
the other; that is, how a <HI>Temple</HI> might be made an <HI>Aedes

at <HI>Rome,</HI> which were both the one and the other at the
&s;ame time.</P>
<P><HI>Lin. 4. Et foeda nigro &s;imulacra &s;umo.</HI> This is a fine
Pa&s;&s;age. <HI>Horace,</HI> after he had &s;poke of the Temples being
burnt, &s;ets before the Eyes of the <HI>Romans</HI> the Statues of
the Gods, all over black with the &s;moke of the Flames
which had turn'd the Temples to A&s;hes. Here it is proper
to mention what we find Book I. Ode XXXV. which was
written a little after this:
<Q><L>&mdash;Quid intactum nefa&s;ti</L>

Profane Wretches! what have we not defil'd? In what
In&s;tance has the Fear of the Gods re&s;train'd the &s;acrile|gious

the Altars which they have &s;par'd?</P>
<P><HI>Lin. 5. Diis te minorem quod geris imperas.</HI> Chri&s;ti|ans
them&s;elves could not have given better In&s;tructions to
Princes: You are no longer Kings than you own a God above

<HEAD>REMARKS
ON
HORACE'S Art of Poetry.</HEAD>
<P><HI>_IN A&s;ia, Greece, Macedo|nia</HI>
and <HI>Egypt,</HI> there were,
Time $word$ of Mind, &s;e|lect
A&s;&s;emblies of Per|&s;ons
to examine the
Writings of the Poets
and Orators. <HI>Augu&s;tus</HI>
erected &s;uch a Society
at <HI>Rome,</HI> and encourag'd them by Re|wards
and Honours. He a&s;&s;ign'd them
the <HI>Temple</HI> and <HI>Library</HI> of <HI>Apollo</HI> to
meet at. And to this the A&s;&s;emblies
of Learned Men, which we call <HI>Acade|mie.</HI>
$owe their Origin. <HI>Theodorus Marcilus,</HI>
who however does not tell us his Au|thority,
&s;ays the Number of this <HI>Ro|man
Academy</HI> was Twenty, of which
Five or Seven can only be term'd <HI>Judges.</HI>
He goes &s;o far as to give us the Names
of 'em, and whether he is right or not,
he cou'd not have nam'd better Men
than his Society was compos'd of. As
<HI>Virgil, Varius, Tarpa, Mecaenas, Plotius,
Valgius, Octavius, Fu&s;cus,</HI> the two <HI>Vi&s;cus's,
Rollio,</HI> the two <HI>Me&s;&s;ala's,</HI> the two <HI>Bilulus's,
Servius, Fulvius, Tibullus, Pi&s;o</HI> the Father,
and <HI>Horace.</HI> The only Foundation I know
for this A&s;&s;ertion of his, is the End of
the Xth Satyr of the Fir&s;t Book. He is not
&s;atisfy'd to give us a Li&s;t of this <HI>Academy;</HI>
he will have it that it was on Account of
<HI>Horace</HI>'s being a Member of it, that he
was put upon Writing <HI>The Art of Poetry,</HI>
and Collecting all the Rules, and all the
Judgments that were made in the <HI>Society.</HI>
I wi&s;h with all my Heart this was &s;o,
becau&s;e what Mr. <HI>La Bruyere,</HI> &s;ays of
&s;uch A&s;&s;emblies would not then be true,
that they never produc'd any Work which
was Entire and Perfect in its Kind. But
whether <HI>Horace</HI> wrote this Piece as a
Publick Matter, or Private, his De&s;ign
was to give the <HI>Romans</HI> an <HI>Art of Poetry,</HI>
that &s;hould take in all that <HI>Ari&s;totle,
Cri$o, Zeno, Democritus</HI> and <HI>Neoptolemus</HI>
of <HI>Paros</HI> had written on the Subject. Nay
&s;ome will have it, that 'tis almo&s;t no|thing
el&s;e but a Compilation of the mo&s;t
Excellent Rules of the Latter. For <HI>Por|phyrius</HI>
writes, <HI>In quem librum conjecit
praecepta Neop$olemi de Arte Poetica, non
quidem omnia, &s;ed eminenti&s;&s;ima.</HI> Horace
<HI>has in this Book &s;et down</HI> Neoptolemus'<HI>s
Rules for the Art of Poetry, not all indeed,
but the mo&s;t Excellent of them.</HI> As he did
not write it regularly, nor ob&s;erve any
<PB N="248" REF="265">
other Order than Chance threw in his
Way; &s;o there is no Method, and
no Connection of Parts in this Trea+ti&s;e,
which &s;eems not to be fini&s;h'd: He
having not Time to give the la&s;t Hand
to it; or what is more likely, not being
willing to be at the Trouble. Tho&s;e
who believe it would be more perfect
if his Ver&s;es were Tran&s;pos'd are mi&s;ta|ken.
All we can do, in my Opinion,
is to mark the Void Spaces, and to divide
the Heads without changing the Form.
This was Mon&s;ieur <HI>Le Fevre</HI>'s Judgment
The want of Connection is not without
its Graces, e&s;pecially in Rules, which
&s;hould be free, and have nothing in
them either Loo&s;e or Langui&s;hing. The
Order <HI>Hein&s;ius</HI> would put it in, &s;eems
on$y to &s;he$ the Beauty of the Di&s;or|der
in which <HI>Horace</HI> left it.</P>
<P>Next to <HI>Ari&s;totle's Art of Poetry,</HI> I
know of no Piece of Critici&s;m in Anti|quity,
which is more Excellent than this.
All his Deci&s;ions are &s;o many Truth$
drawn from the Nature of the Things
he treats of. <HI>Julius Scaliger</HI> err'd very
much again&s;t good Sen&s;e and Rea&s;on, in
what he &s;aid of this Work. <HI>Will you
know,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>what I think of</HI> Horace'<HI>s</HI>
Art of Poetry? '<HI>Tis an Art taught with|out
Art. De Arte quae res quod Sentiam
Quid? Equidem qu$d de Arte &s;ine Arte
Tradita.</HI> Tho' 'tis only an Epi&s;tle like the
preceding Ones yet <HI>Horace</HI> gives it the Ti|tle
of <HI>The Art of Poetry, De Arte Poetica,</HI>
to di&s;tingui&s;h it from the Others, in
which he treated of this Art only Oc+ca&s;ionally.
The Antiquity of this Title
is not to be doubted of, &s;ince <HI>Quintilian</HI>
quotes it in the IIId Chapter of his
VIIIth Book, <HI>$word$ enim tole e&s;t mon&s;trum

Horace</HI> all at once lays down the mo&s;t
general and nece&s;&s;ary Rule, on which all
the re&s;t are founded, which is the Sim|plicity
and Unity of the Subject, in the
D$$po&s;ition, the Ornaments, and the Stile.
He could not render the Faults commit+ted
again&s;t this <HI>&V;nity</HI> better than by
comparing them to this Extravagance in
a Picture.</P>

too daring for them. They abu&s;e the
Privilege of Poetry, and thus excu&s;e their
mo&s;t Mon&s;trous Fancies, and mo&s;t Ex|travagant
Dreams. That Privilege is of
great Extent, 'tis true; <HI>Ovid</HI> talks of
the <HI>Faecunda Licentia Vatum;</HI> and <HI>Lucian</HI>
a&s;&s;erts, that Painters and Poets are not
accountable for their Fancies; but <HI>Horace</HI>
is &s;hewing us what Bounds they ought
to &s;et to this Licence.</P>
<P>11. <HI>Scimus.] Horace</HI>'s An&s;wer to the
Bad Poets after having &s;aid, <HI>I know</HI> the
Privilege of Poetry, he would go on
<HI>&s;ed non,</HI> but he's interrupted by the &s;ame
Poets, who proceed,</P>
<P><HI>Et hanc veniam petimus damu&s;que vt
ci&s;&s;im.</HI>] My Opinion of this Ver&s;e is di&s;|cover'd
in the preceding Remark. Some
will have it, that <HI>Horace</HI> continues his
$n&s;wer without Interruption, that as a
$oet he &s;ays, <HI>Hanc veniam petimus, I de|mand
this Permi&s;&s;ion;</HI> As a Critick, he
adds, <HI>Damu&s;que vici&s;&s;im, I give it in my
Turn.</HI> This agrees with the Old Com|mentator,
who writes, <HI>petimus quidem ut
Poetae, damus autem ut Critici.</HI> But how cou'd
<HI>Horace</HI> demand Permi&s;&s;ion to u&s;e this
Liberty, when he never look'd upon
him&s;elf as a Poet? There mu&s;t be a
Mi&s;take in this Pa&s;&s;age. After he had &s;aid
<HI>Scim$s</HI> he is interrupted, as is ob|&s;erv'd
before, by the III Poets. <HI>Et hanc
veniam petimus damu&s;que vici&s;&s;im. We
claim the Privilege, as we give it to others.</HI>
He cannot mean him&s;elf, he being no
Poet, as he declares afterwards, <HI>Nil &s;cri|bens
ip&s;e.</HI> Be&s;ides the Dialogue is more a|greeable,
more lively; and more like
<HI>Horace</HI>'s Manner.</P>
<P>12. <HI>Sed non ut placidis cocant immitia.]
Horace</HI>'s An&s;wer, We give you the Pri|vilege
you Demand, but on Condition you
do not abu&s;e it. I, a long Time, thought
the Fir&s;t Thirteen Ver&s;es of this Epi&s;tle
were a Sort of Dedication and Preface,
and that <HI>Horace,</HI> to excu&s;e the Di&s;order
in which he left it, wrote to the <HI>Pi&s;o's;
The Book I addre&s;s to you is like the Pi|cture
I have been &s;peaking of,</HI> In which I
was mi&s;taken. He would then certainly
have written it <HI>Fore Librum hunc &s;imilem.</HI>
Add to this, that not looking upon Him|&s;elf
to be a Poet, nor on his <HI>Art of
Poetry</HI> as a Work of Importance, 'tis
not likely he &s;hould go about to excu&s;e
its Want of Regularity; it being nei|ther
Nece&s;&s;ary not Po&s;&s;ible to observe it
in &s;uch a Treati&s;e as this. The Di&s;cove|ry
of the Dialogue between the Bad
Poets and <HI>Horace</HI> confirms me in the
Opinion that I was mi&s;taken, and my
Rea&s;on has convinc'd &s;everal good Jud|ges
of the &s;ame Mi&s;take.</P>
<P><HI>&V;t placidis cocant immitia.</HI>] Painters and
Poets are only Imitators, and are to paint
only what is or what may be; there be|ing
nothing el&s;e that can be imitated.
But they have both often abus'd their
Art, and for&s;aken probable Idea's for
Mon&s;trous Imaginations. <HI>Vitruvius</HI> com|plains
of this Fauit in Painters, in the
Vth Chapter of his VIIth Book: From
hence proceed <HI>Grote&s;ques,</HI> which are not to
<PB N="250" REF="267">
be compar'd to a Regular Figure. This
Rule of <HI>Horace</HI> is one of the mo&s;t Im|portant
in the <HI>Art of Poetry;</HI> never to
join Incompatible Subjects, nor offend
again&s;t Nature, Veri&s;imility and Truth.</P>
<P>14. <HI>Inceptis gravibus plerumque &amp; mag|n$s
profeffis.</HI>] He comes from the general
Rule to Particulars, and gives an Example
of the Vitious Variety which he con|demns.
He chu&s;es One that's the lea&s;t
&s;hocking, but tis by &s;o much the more
Dangerous <HI>Vice,</HI> by how much it &s;lides
in under an Appearance of Virtue. He
is &s;peaking of De&s;criptions, a Snare
which is almo&s;t inevitable to little
Genius's. <HI>Horace</HI> &s;hews us how apt Poets
are to fall into the <HI>Ridiculous</HI> by this
Means: From Grave and Serious Be|ginnings,
which promi&s;e Sublime and
Marvellous things, they de&s;cend into
a &s;hining De&s;cription of an Wood, an
Altar of <HI>Diana,</HI> a River, the <HI>Rhine,</HI>
the Rainbow; Their De&s;criptions
are &s;tirch'd together like Patch-Work.
Their Patches, indeed, are Purple, but
are Childi&s;h and Extravagant, becau&s;e ill
plac'd. Writers mu&s;t never abandon
them&s;elves to &s;uch Digre&s;&s;ious, let them
be of what Nature &s;oever, when their
De&s;ign calls them el&s;ewhere.</P>
<P>16. <HI>Quem lucus &amp; ara Diana.</HI>] I be|lieve,
with <HI>Theodorus Marcilus,</HI> he &s;peaks
of the Wood and Altar of <HI>Aricia,</HI> pre|tended
to have been Built by <HI>Ore&s;tes,</HI>
who there Con&s;ecrated the Statue of
<HI>Diana Tauricae,</HI> which, when he had kill'd
King <HI>Th$as,</HI> he brought from <HI>Scythia.</HI>
The Poets thought this a fine Subject for
De&s;criptions. It took in <HI>Ore&s;tes, Diana
Taurica,</HI> her Sacrifices in <HI>Scythia,</HI> and at
<HI>Aricia,</HI> with the odd Cu&s;tom in her
Temple. There cou'd be but One Prie&s;t
and he a Fugitive. He mu&s;t with
his own Hand kill the Prie&s;t his Pre|dece&s;&s;or,
if he would get into his Place.
For which Rea&s;on the Prie&s;t who held
it was always Arm'd to defend him&s;elf.
<HI>Ovid</HI> calls this Temple of <HI>Aricia,</HI> a King|dom
acquir'd by the Sword, and with a
Criminal Hand,
<Q>Pertaque per gladi$s regna n$cente man$.</Q></P>
<P>18. <HI>Aut flumen Rhenum.] Horace</HI>
had without doubt been often tir'd with
the De&s;cription of the <HI>Rhine,</HI> in the
Poems written on <HI>Augu&s;tus</HI>'s Victories on
that Side. The Bad Poets never omit
plunging into that River, as <HI>Alpinus,</HI> of
whom he &s;peaks in the Xth Satyr of the
I&s;t Book.</P>
<Q><L>Turgidus Alpinus jugulat dum Memnona,
dumque</L>
<L>Diffingit Rheni luteum caput, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></L></Q>
<P><HI>Aut pluviu$ de&s;cribitur Arcus.</HI>] The
Rainbow is as likely as any thing to
turn a Wretched Poet's Brain. The
Wonderful Mixture of its Colours are
with them &s;o worthy of Admiration,
that they let no Opportunity &s;lip to de|&s;cribe
it; few imitating in this the Di&s;|cretion
of <HI>Homer</HI> and <HI>Virgil. Homer</HI> &s;ays
not above One Word of her, and <HI>Virgil</HI>
but Two Lines,
<Q>Ergo Iris croceis per coelum ro&s;cida pennis
Mille trahens varios adver&s;o &s;ole Colores
Advolat.</Q></P>
<P>A De&s;cription as Rapid as <HI>Iris</HI>'s Flight.</P>
<P>19. <HI>Et forta&s;&s;e cupre&s;&s;um &s;cis &s;imulare.</HI>]
The Young Poets and Painters began the
Practice of their Arts with De&s;criptions
and Imitations of Cypre&s;s.</P>
<P>20 <HI>Si fractis enatat ex&s;pes navibus.</HI>]
What's the Painting of Cypre&s;s to that
of a Wreck? What are De&s;criptions in
Poetry, when Illu&s;trious Actions are the
Subject of the Song? <HI>Horace</HI> alludes to
tho&s;e <HI>ex vot$</HI> Pictures, made by &s;uch as
had e&s;cap'd Shipwreck.</P>
<P>21. <HI>Amphora coepit in&s;titui, currente ro$a
cur &V;rceus exit?</HI>] An Image taken from
a Potter, who commonly began his Trade
by making little Pots called <HI>&V;rceos,</HI> and
ended with a great Pitcher call'd <HI>Am|phora,</HI>
which was his Ma&s;ter-piece. To
begin with an <HI>Amphora</HI> and end with an
<HI>&V;rceus,</HI> is like a Poet who after a Mag|nificent
Beginning, falls and is lo&s;t in
De&s;criptions. <HI>Amphora</HI> an&s;wers to <HI>in|caeptis
gravibus,</HI> and <HI>&V;rceus</HI> to <HI>purpureus
pannus.</HI></P>
<P>23. <HI>Denique &s;it quodvis &s;implex duntaxat
&amp; unum.</HI>] The Rule that re&s;ults from
what he has &s;aid. Simplicity and Unity
are entirely oppo&s;ite to the Fault he has
<PB N="251" REF="268">
been &s;peaking of. De&s;criptions, which
have no immediate Relation to the Sub|ject,
corrupt and de&s;troy them. <HI>Homer,
Virgil,</HI> and <HI>Sophocles</HI>'s De&s;criptions are
all nece&s;&s;ary, and well introduc'd.</P>
<P>25 <HI>Decipimur &s;pecie recti.</HI>] This is
not a new Rule, but the general Rea&s;on
of the Fault he has been explaining:
We are deceiv'd by Appearance in the
Beauties of Art, as well as tho&s;e of Na|ture;
a Poet thinks to adorn his Subject
by De&s;criptions, and he &s;poils it. <HI>Brevis
e&s;&s;e laboro, ob&s;curus fi$,</HI> &amp;c. are Exam|ples
to confirm this Propo&s;ition.</P>
<P><HI>Brevis e&s;&s;e,</HI> &amp;c.] Brevity is certainly
one of the great Beauties of Di&s;cour&s;e;
but &s;o near a Neighbour to Ob&s;curity,
that it is very difficult in following the
one, not to fall into the other. Per|&s;picuity
is the principal Virtue, <HI>Virtus
prima per&s;picuitas.</HI></P>
<P>26. <HI>Sectantem lavia nervi deficiunt.</HI>] As
by endeavouring to make &s;trong Ver&s;es
and Expre&s;&s;ions, an Author renders
them hard and rough, &s;o by endeavou|ring
to poli&s;h, he very often weakens
them.</P>
<P>27. <HI>Profe&s;&s;us grandia turget.</HI>] They
fall into this Error, that &s;tretch what is
<HI>Grand</HI> too far; as <HI>Gorgias,</HI> in calling
<HI>Xerxes</HI> the <HI>Jupiter of the Per&s;ians,</HI> and he
who call'd <HI>Brutus</HI> the <HI>Sun of A&s;ia;</HI> they
become Bomba&s;t, when they &s;tudy to be
<HI>Great.</HI></P>
<P>28. <HI>Serpit Humi tutus nimium timi|du&s;que
procellae.</HI>] Poetry is a Sea, and
tho&s;e who Sail on it, if they are wi&s;e,
will never venture too far from the Shoar,
nor come too near it. <HI>Horace</HI>'s Expre&s;|&s;ion
&s;eems rather to be borrow'd from
<HI>Birds,</HI> who creep on the Ground, when
the Winds and Storms make 'em afraid
of ri&s;ing into the Air.</P>
<P>29. <HI>Qui variare cupit rem prodigialiter
unam.</HI>] This Ver&s;e proves&punc; that whatever he
has already &s;aid is only the Con&s;equence
of the &s;ame Rule. For he returns to
it again, by &s;hewing, That tho&s;e who to
arrive at the <HI>Marvellous,</HI> which he here
terms <HI>Prodigious,</HI> vary a Subject, and
$ack to it pompous De&s;criptions, form
Mon&s;ters. <HI>Omnia Mon&s;tra faciunt,</HI> &s;ays
<HI>Catullus.</HI> 'Tis as if they &s;hould place
Dolphins in the Woods, and Boats in
the Sea. The word <HI>prodigialiter</HI> is taken
here in a good Sen&s;e, as are often out
Words <HI>Prodigious</HI> and <HI>Prodigiou&s;ly.</HI> For
it mu&s;t not be imagin'd that it refers to
<HI>Appingit.</HI></P>
<P>31. <HI>In vitium ducit culpa fuga.</HI>] The
fear of falling into one Vice, is fre|quently
the Occa&s;ion of our falling into
greater than that which we endea|vour'd
to avoid. We would &s;hun a tedi|ous
Uniformity, and we are guilty of a
mon&s;trous Mixture: The rea&s;on is, we
make this Mixture without Art, which
can only teach us to do it, and not of|fend
Uniformity. Our be&s;t Examples
are <HI>Homer, Theocritus,</HI> and <HI>Virgil.</HI></P>
<P>32. <HI>Aemilium circa ludum faber I$us.]
Horace</HI> here means a certain Statuary,
who liv'd at the Bottom of the <HI>Circus,</HI>
near a Place call'd the <HI>Hall of</HI> Aemilius;
becau&s;e a Fencing-Ma&s;ter, nam'd <HI>Aemi|lius
Lentulus,</HI> kept his Gladiators there.
This Statuary gave a great deal of grace
and ea&s;ine&s;s to Hair, and fini&s;h'd the
Nails admirably; but take his Statues
all together they were wretched Pieces,
there being no Connection of the Parts,
nor that Agreement which, like the
Soul, adds Life and Action to the Fi|gure,
and is the All in All in a Sta|tue.
'Tis the &s;ame with Poets, who
know not how to make any Thing but
a De&s;cription, to expre&s;s a Sentiment,
or make a &s;trong Compari&s;on, with all
which they are at the be&s;t but mi&s;era|ble
Poets.</P>
<P>34. <HI>Ponere totum.] Ponere, to put,</HI>
for <HI>to do to make,</HI> as in the <HI>Greek <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">:</HI>
He &s;ays el&s;ewhere, <HI>Solers nunc
hominem ponere nunc deum;</HI> and <HI>totum</HI>
is what we call <HI>All together,</HI> a Term pro|perly
us'd in Paining and Sculpture,
when Pictures or other Pieces, con&s;i&s;ting
of many Figures, are &s;o di&s;pos'd, that
the different Parts agree to form one
&s;ingle and the &s;ame Whole, and repre|&s;ent
one &s;ingle Object. 'Tis al&s;o made
u&s;e of in Pieces where there is but one
Figure, either in Sculpture or Painting,
the different Parts of which ought to
have &s;o natural a Connection with each
other, that they may form but one
&s;ingle and the &s;ame Body. 'Tis not
enough that the Arti&s;t knows how to
make an Head, an Arm, a Foot, he
mu&s;t under&s;tand how to put the whole
<PB N="252" REF="269">
together, &s;o that it may be one &s;ingle
Figure, which has nothing maim'd in
it, but is every where equally well de|&s;ign'd
and fini&s;h'd.</P>
<P>36. <HI>Quam pravo vivere Na&s;o.</HI> If a
Man has an ugly No&s;e, he will be ugly,
tho' all the other Parts of his Face are
beautiful; and a Poet, if all the other
parts of his Poem be fine, will be an ill
Poet, if he offends again&s;t Simplicity
and Unity.</P>
<P>38. <HI>Sumite materiam, ve&s;tris, qui &s;cri|bitis
aequam Viribus.</HI>] Every Poet who
makes choice of a Subject that is not
proportionable to his Strength offends
again&s;t the Art of Poetry; and 'tis im|po&s;&s;ible
he &s;hould &s;ucceed. See the Re|marks
on the 26th Chapter of <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI>'s
Art of Poetry.</P>
<P>39. <HI>Et ver&s;ate diu quid ferre recu|&s;e$t.</HI>]
A Man mu&s;t not pre&s;ently con|clude,
that becau&s;e he has by Chance
made a good Madrigal, Epigram, or
Song, he's therefore fit to write an He|roick
Poem; he is to con&s;ider his
Strength. <HI>Tibullus</HI> would perhaps have
written bad Odes, and <HI>Horace</HI> bad Ele|gies.
The <HI>Hebrews</HI> had a Proverb upon
this, <HI>Pro Camel$ Sarcina, Suit your Bur|then
to your Camel.</HI></P>
<P>40. Cui lecta potenter erit res.] Potenter,
<HI>for</HI> according to his Strength.</P>
<P>42. <HI>Ordinis hac Virtus erit &amp; Venus,
aut ego fallor.] Horace</HI> here explains in
a few Words, the Virtue and Grace of
the Order a Poet ought to ob&s;erve in
the Di&s;po&s;ition of his Subject; and adds
the&s;e Orders, <HI>aut ago fallor,</HI> it being a
new Rule of his, made by him, from
the Practice of the greate&s;t Authors of
Antiquity.</P>
<P>43. <HI>&V;t jam nunc dicat, jam nunc deben|tia
dici pleraque differat.</HI>] This <HI>debentia
dici</HI> &s;erves for two Propo&s;itions, <HI>dicat &amp;
differat.</HI> The Con&s;truction and Sen&s;e of
the Pa&s;&s;age is this; <HI>&V;t jam nunc dicat
debentia dici jam nunc, &amp; pleraque differat
jam nunc debentia dici: Let him &s;ay at fir&s;t
Things that ought to be at fir&s;t &s;aid, and
re&s;erve for another Time the greate&s;t Part
of tho&s;e that &s;hould al&s;o have been &s;aid at
fir&s;t. Horace</HI> di&s;covers here one of the
greate&s;t Secrets of Poetry. In Drama|tick
Poetry, as well as Epick, the great
Ma&s;ters open the Scene as near as they
can to the Cata&s;trophe, always taking
the Action at the Moment it draws to
an End: They artfully bring in after|wards
the Events preceding, which they
&s;hould not have told us at fir&s;t, as in a
Hi&s;tory. <HI>Homer, Sophocles, Euripides,</HI> ne|ver
did otherwi&s;e. By this keeping off
the Cata&s;trophe, by probable and natu|ral
Incidents, when we every Minute ex|pected
it, our Curio&s;ity is the more en|flam'd,
and all the Pa&s;&s;ions are mov'd
in us one after another, which could
not be done in a Methodical Order; to
prove this we need only read <HI>Apolloni|us</HI>'s
<HI>Argonauts; Longinus</HI> owns there is
not a &s;ingle Fault in that Piece, and
yet 'tis mortally tedious, and the chief
Rea&s;on is, 'tis methodical, and pro&s;ecu|ted
without Interruption from the Be|ginning
to the End; the greate&s;t Fault
it could have, for there's nothing &s;o
dull as a Poet;
<Q><L>Who when he &s;ings a Hero's glorious Deeds,</L>
<L>Writes a dry Hi&s;tory, and by Dates proceeds.</L></Q></P>
<P>45. <HI>Hoc amet, hoc &s;pernat.</HI>] Having
&s;poken of the Order, he comes now to
the Choice of the Incidents, which is
not ea&s;y to be made: What is good
for the Epick Poem, is not for Trage|dy;
neither is it &s;ufficient to know which
to take and which to refu&s;e. The Poet
mu&s;t put tho&s;e he takes in their pro|per
Place, where their Effect may be
mo&s;t &s;urpri&s;ing, and mo&s;t convenient for
the Poem, &s;ince the &s;ame Thing plac'd
in a different Manner has a quite diffe|rent
Effect.</P>
<P><HI>Promi&s;&s;i carminis.</HI>] A Poem that
has been a long while expected, and rais'd
the Curio&s;ity of the Publick: For every
Thing which the World have great Ex|pectations
of &s;hould be more perfect than
what they do not expect. <HI>Horace</HI> had,
perhaps, <HI>Virgil</HI>'s <HI>Aeneis</HI> in view; 'twas
&s;everal Years after that Poem was ex|pected,
that it appear'd, <HI>Ne&s;cio quid ma|jus
na&s;citur Iliade.</HI></P>
<P>46. <HI>In Verbis etiam tenuis.</HI>] From
the Di&s;po&s;ition of the Subject, and the
Choice of the Incidents, he comes to
the Que&s;tion, Whether the Poet is al|low'd
<PB N="253" REF="270">
to invent new Words: He main|tains
that he is, and lays down the
Rules for it, <HI>Tenuis, &s;ubtle, agreeable,
fine.</HI></P>
<P>47. <HI>Notum &s;i callida verbum reddide
rit junctura novum.</HI>] New Words are
of two &s;orts, Simple or Compound. We
&s;hall hereafter talk of Simple. Com+pound
are &s;uch as are made of two
Words, as <HI>Velivolum, &s;axifragum.</HI> This
Compo&s;ition <HI>Horace</HI> here terms <HI>Junctu|ram:</HI>
There are two other Con&s;tructions
of this Ver&s;e quite different; &s;ome pre|tend
<HI>Horace</HI> is not &s;peaking of Words,
but of Expre&s;&s;ions, when by the help
of Epithets, Adverbs, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> we deter|mine
certain known Phra&s;es from an
Ordinary U&s;e to an Extraordinary, as
<HI>Horace</HI> has often practis'd with &s;o much
Succe&s;s, that <HI>Petronius</HI> &s;ays of him, <HI>Ho|ratii
Curio&s;a Felicitas,</HI> and <HI>Quintilian,
Verbis felici&s;&s;ime audax.</HI> This Con&s;tructi|on
is more Ingenious than True. <HI>Ho|race</HI>
would never have call'd it <HI>Junctu|ram,</HI>
which denotes nece&s;&s;arily a Binding$
a Connecting, as when out of Two
Things One is made. Further, 'tis nei|ther
po&s;&s;ible nor natural to give Rules
for &s;uch Boldne&s;&s;es as the&s;e, which depend
on every Man's <HI>Go&ucirc;t,</HI> on his Genius, and
his Knowledge of the force and extent
of Words. In &s;hort, this Rule would
be out of its Place here, &s;ince <HI>Horace</HI>
&s;ays in the preceding Ver&s;e <HI>in Verbis
&s;erendis,</HI> which cannot admit of &s;uch an
Explanation: The other Con&s;truction is,
<HI>Si callida junctura reddiderit Verbum No+vum,
Notum:</HI> If you &s;o make u&s;e of a
new Word, that the Place where you
put it may make it be known, and ren|der
the true Signification to be at fir&s;t
&s;ight ea&s;ily Comprehended. Which Con|&s;truction
&s;eems to me to be neither &s;o
good nor &s;o true as the other, nor in|deed
to be maintain'd. The Que&s;tion
is not concerning the placing of Words,
but of making, <HI>de Verbis &s;erendis;</HI> and
what <HI>Horace</HI> adds afterwards of new
&s;imple Words is an undoubted Proof
that he &s;peaks here of Compound.</P>
<P>48. <HI>Si forte nece&s;&s;e e&s;t Indiciis mon|&s;trare
recentibus abdita rerum.</HI>] This re+lates
to Simple Words, which <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI>
terms <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, and <HI>Cicero, Ficta,
Words never heard of before. Horace</HI> de|clares
'tis allowable for a Poet to make
'em, when he is oblig'd to expre&s;s
Things that are unknown, as the <HI>Com|pa&s;s,
Artillery, Powder;</HI> he may then in|vent
Words, but mu&s;t take care that
they expre&s;s either the Nature of the
Thing, or the Effect it produces. For
this Rea&s;on <HI>Homer</HI> is commended, he
being the fir&s;t who &s;aid <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">,

the Hi&s;&s;ing of Red hot Iron thrown
into Water, and the la&s;t the <HI>Barking</HI> of
Wolves and Dogs. The <HI>French</HI> Word
<HI>Lapper</HI> to lick, is of this kind.</P>
<P>49. <HI>Indiciis.</HI>] Words ought to be the

The <HI>Cethegi</HI> are here repre&s;ented as a

cumber&s;ome; wearing only a kind of

Pane of it, which they threw over their
Left Shoulder, hung down their Backs,

another Place of that Di&s;cour&s;e. Mo&s;t
People imagine, that by Heroick Ver&s;e
is meant the <HI>Hexameter,</HI> which is a Mi|&s;take:
All Heroick Ver&s;es are indeed

Heroick Ver&s;es, Six Feet plac'd how you

which is very rare. Without the Ob&s;er|vation
of the&s;e Rules, the Ver&s;e will be
<HI>Hexameter</HI> not Heroick; and the Criticks
reject it, like that of <HI>Virgil,</HI>
<Q>Magnanimi Jovis Ingratum a&s;cendere

whether it relates to that which

a Poet who does not know how to di&s;tin|gui&s;h

the Epick Tone, or would mix the Soft|ne&s;s
of the Elegy with the Roughne&s;s
of the Iambick, would make but a &s;orry
Poem of it. Mr. <HI>Dacier</HI>'s Complaint of

fir&s;t for its Mea&s;ure and Feet; for the
<HI>Tragick</HI> and <HI>Comick</HI> Ver&s;e may be both
<HI>Iambicks,</HI> and both admit of <HI>Spondees;</HI>
yet there is a great deal of difference
between them: The <HI>Tragick</HI> admits of
the <HI>Spondee</HI> only in the fir&s;t, third, and
fifth Foot, which renders its Motion the
more Noble and Pompous: The Comick
admits it in all tho&s;e Feet, becau&s;e its
Motion is thereby the more Natural and
Unaffected. The &s;econd Rea&s;on why a
Ver&s;e may be call'd <HI>Tragick</HI> or <HI>Comick,</HI>
is on account of the Meanne&s;s of its
Expre&s;&s;ions and Figures. Thus it is cer|tain
that Tragick Ver&s;e ought not to be
us'd in Comedy, nor Comick in Trage|dy.
<HI>Horace</HI> &s;peaking of Feet and Mea|&s;ure,
in the 253d Ver&s;e; I believe he
intends here Expre&s;&s;ions and Figures
only: Nothing is more Vicious than
Lofty Expre&s;&s;ions and Noble Figures in
Comedy, for which the Common Phra&s;e
is mo&s;t proper; whereas Tragedy requires
a Sublime and Bold Stile.</P>

Imitations of Humane Actions. The
Stile &s;hould be proportionable to the Sub|ject,

Oh Heaven! O Earth! Oh the Seas of</HI>

<P>95. <HI>Et Tragicus plerumque dolet Sermone

encroaching on the <HI>Comick</HI> Stile, than
<HI>Comedy</HI> does on the <HI>Tragick. Horace</HI>
mu&s;t be taken here as meaning only in
the great Di&s;tre&s;&s;es of Tragedy, where
Grief ought to be expre&s;s'd in a Simple

<HI>Fine,</HI> it &s;hould be <HI>Touching. Horace</HI> here
referrs to the Ignorance of &s;uch as fancy
they have made a <HI>Fine Play,</HI> when they
have been lavi&s;h of the Flowers of Rhe|torick;
all which are Nothing if it does
not move, for that's the principal end
of <HI>Dram$tick</HI> Poetry: 'Tis with this View
<HI>Plato</HI> calls Tragedy <HI>The mo&s;t diverting and
moving Effect of Poetry.</HI> In <HI>Dulcia,</HI> Sweet

would certainly never have call'd a
Play <HI>Commendable,</HI> if it had not been Moving.
'Tis thus in a Picture; the Bu&s;ine&s;s is not to
make it glare with fine Colours without
Conduct, but to render the Action &s;en|&s;ible.
In order to which, no Colour

<P>102. <HI>Si vis me flere dolendum e&s;t primum
ip&s;e tibi.</HI>] <HI>Cicero</HI> has explain'd this Rule
at large in his IId Book <HI>De Oratore.</HI>
Poets and Orators can never move an
Auditory, if the Speakers do not &s;hew
that they are Them&s;elves mov'd with
the Pa&s;&s;ions they wou'd In&s;pire. There
is a Story of an Old <HI>Greek</HI> Player nam'd
<HI>Polus,</HI> who in the <HI>Electra</HI> of <HI>Sephocles,</HI>
us'd to Play the Part of that Prince&s;s.
It happen'd that a Son of his, whom
he dearly Lov'd, Dy'd; and after the
fir&s;t Tra$&s;ports of his Grief were over,
he took his Part again, and Play'd <HI>Ele|ctra;</HI>
in which, in&s;tead of the Urn with
the Fal&s;e A&s;hes of <HI>Electra,</HI> he came in
with the Urn wherein were the True
A&s;hes of his Son; which embracing, he
pronounc'd the&s;e Words, <HI>Oh Doleful
Monument of him who was of all Mankind
mo&s;t Dear to me,</HI> with &s;o Natural a
Grief, &s;uch True and Lively Tears, that
it had a prodigious Effect on the Audi|ence.
This Rule of <HI>Horace</HI>'s is taken
al&s;o from <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI>'s <HI>Art of Poetry;</HI> the
Philo&s;opher adding to the Precept the
Means to perform it. <HI>The Poet,</HI> &s;ays he,
<HI>when he is compo&s;ing, mu&s;t as far as po&s;&s;i|ble
imitate the Ge&s;tures and Actions of
tho&s;e he introduces on the Stage. He who
is truly mov'd, will in the &s;ame manner

The greate&s;t Poets have not al|ways
put &s;uch Words into the Mouth of
Sorrow, as agree with it. Mon&s;ieur <HI>Cor|neille</HI>
him&s;elf often fell into this Error.
When <HI>Chimene</HI> in the <HI>Cid</HI> demands Ju|&s;tice
for the Murder of her Father, and
&s;peaks of the &s;pilling of his Blood, &s;he
&s;ays,
<Q><L>Spilt as it is, the Blood &s;till reeks with
Rage,</L>
<L>To find 'twas lo&s;t in any Cau&s;e but Yours.</L></Q>
Is this to talk like a Per&s;on in Affli|ction?
<HI>Non projicit Ampullas.</HI> Here are
the <HI>Swelling Thoughts</HI> &s;till. What can
be more trivial than to make the Blood
that was &s;pilt, think and find, and to

<HI>Sophocles</HI> mourns the Death of her Father
after quite another Rate.</P>
<P>106. <HI>Iratum plena minarum.] Horace</HI>
feigns el&s;ewhere, that when <HI>Prometheus</HI>
form'd Man, he borrow'd each Quality

Choler into his Heart, took it from the
Lyon. What can give a ju&s;ter Idea of
the Effects of this Pa&s;&s;ion? There mu&s;t

<P><HI>Severum &s;eria dictu.</HI>] A grave Per&s;on

<HI>Euripides</HI> is not &s;o Di&s;creet as <HI>Sophocles.
Seneca</HI> the Tragick Poet never minds this

<P>108. <HI>Format enim Natura prius nos in|tus

the&s;e Four Admirable Ver&s;es, <HI>Horace</HI>
gives the Rea&s;on of the Precepts con|tain'd
in the Two preceding ones. His
Rea&s;on is drawn from our Mother Na+ture,
who gave us a Heart capable of
feeling all the Changes of Fortune, and
a Tongue to expre&s;s it. When our
Words do not an&s;wer the Condition we
are in, the Heart &s;trikes one String in
the In&s;trument of Man, in&s;tead of ano|ther,
and makes a very di&s;agreeable Di&s;|cord.</P>
<P>1$9. <HI>Juvat aut impellit.</HI>] Nature helps
us to put our &s;elves into a Rage. <HI>Horace</HI>
adds <HI>Impellit,</HI> to denote the Impetuo&s;ity
of that Pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>110. <HI>Aut ad humum moerore gravi de|ducit.]
Horace</HI>'s Expre&s;&s;ion agrees very
well with the Pa&s;&s;ion he &s;peaks of. How
natural is his Image of the Humiliation of
an Afflicted Man? How Ridiculous does
it render al Frothy Expre&s;&s;ions in that
Condition?</P>
<P>112. <HI>Si dicentis erunt fortunis ab&s;ona

not much ob&s;erv'd by the Moderns.</P>
<P><HI>Divu&s;ne loquatur an Heros.</HI>] Some have
read it <HI>Davu&s;ne loquatur, an Eros. Eros</HI>
was the Name of an Hone&s;t Foot-man
in <HI>Menander</HI>'s Play, as <HI>Davus</HI> that of a
Knavi&s;h one. But <HI>Horace</HI> is not here di&s;|cour&s;ing
of Comedy: Be&s;ides, the Diffe|rence
between Footman and Footman
is not con&s;iderable enough to be taken
Notice of by him in a Precept. Others
have read it <HI>Divu&s;ne loquatur, an Irus.</HI>
The Sen&s;e of this is too mean, and <HI>I|rus</HI>
is not a Tragick Per&s;on. Others,
<HI>Davu&s;ne loquatur, an Heros.</HI> The Matter
in Di&s;pute, as I have &s;aid already, re|lates
only to Tragedy, and to the Diffe|rence

Di&s;cour&s;ing of Comedy al&s;o, on Account
of the Meanne&s;s of the Per&s;ons, whereas
he is &s;till Di&s;cour&s;ing of Tragedy only,
in which it was not uncommon for the
Antients to introduce Trade&s;men, Shep|herds
and Labourers. You have a Mer|chant
in the <HI>Philoctetes</HI> of <HI>Sophocles;</HI> and
in <HI>Euripides, Clytemne&s;ira</HI> gives <HI>Electra</HI>
in a Marriage to a Labourer. He opens
the Scene with it. See the 78th Ver&s;e
<HI>&amp; &s;eq.</HI> The be&s;t Comment on this
Pa&s;&s;age of <HI>Horace,</HI> is what <HI>Plutarch</HI> writes

Subjects that have no Foun|dation
in <HI>Hi&s;tory,</HI> or the <HI>Fable;</HI> he calls
them Common, becau&s;e every Body has
a Right to them, and is free to Invent
them. 'Tis very difficult to invent a
New Character that &s;hall be Ju&s;t and
Natural; the Moderns have &s;ucceeded
much better in their <HI>Known</HI> Stories than
in their <HI>Invented</HI> Ones. Let a Character
be form'd ever &s;o ju&s;tly, every one will
pretend to a Right to Judge of it, and
Cen&s;ure it, if it is not conformable to
the Idea they them&s;elves have of it;
whereas when a Poet follows a Known
One, there's a Common Rule which he
mu&s;t not deviate from, and which is the
Standard of their Judgment as well as
his Compo&s;ition. <HI>Horace</HI> cannot by

take the Subjects of their Tragedies out
of <HI>Homer</HI>'s Poems, and he here Cauti|ons
them again&s;t the Faults they might
be guilty of. The fir&s;t and mo&s;t con&s;i|derable,
is to amu&s;e them&s;elves, <HI>circa
Orbem vilem &amp; patulum, with a vile Cir|cuit
open to all the World,</HI> that is, with
bringing into a Tragedy all the Parts of
<HI>Homer</HI>'s Poem, imitating his very Con|nection
and Chain: As for In&s;tance, in
opening the Scene with the Quarrel be|tween
<HI>Achilles</HI> and <HI>Agamemnon,</HI> and
clo&s;ing all with <HI>Hector</HI>'s Funeral. <HI>He|in&s;ius</HI>
is mi&s;taken, in thinking <HI>Horace</HI>
means a <HI>vain Circuit of Words, that do
not relate to the Subject.</HI> The <HI>Circuit</HI> he
&s;peaks of, is in the Fable, and nothing
can be more Vicious: For what would
be but of a ju&s;t Extent for an <HI>Heroick</HI>

the narrow Limits of a Tragedy. <HI>Re|member,

<HI>not to make a Tragedy of an Epick Plot;
I call an Epick Plot, a Plot con&s;i&s;ting of

<PB N="163" REF="280">
did not think it nece&s;&s;ary for me to confine

<P>134. <HI>Nec de&s;ilies imitator in arctum unde
pedem proferre.</HI>] This is my Opinion is
one of the mo&s;t difficult Places in <HI>Ho|race:</HI>
The Poet does not here &s;peak of
tho&s;e who confine them&s;elves to a cer|tain
Mea&s;ure of Ver&s;e, in their Imitati|on;
nor of tho&s;e who lo&s;e Sight of
their Original. He has already given
<HI>Tragick</HI> Poets two Ways of rendring Sub|jects
that have been handled, which he
prefers to Invented ones: The Fir&s;t is,
not to bring the whole Matter of an He|roick
Poem into a Tragedy; and the
Second, not to Tran&s;late it Word for
Word: He here gives them a Third,
not to keep too clo&s;e to their Author,
in imitating one Action only, &s;o as to
perplex them&s;elves, or break the Laws
of Tragedy, which Laws are very dif|ferent
from tho&s;e of Heroick Poetry;
&s;uppo&s;e, for Example, I was to write a
Tragedy on <HI>Achilles</HI>'s Choler, and to
follow the two fir&s;t Rules of <HI>Horace;</HI>
that is, not to put all the <HI>Ilias</HI> in my
Play, nor u&s;e his Expre&s;&s;ions: I &s;hall
break the Third Rule, if I &s;ervilely re|pre&s;ent
the &s;ame Circum&s;tances of <HI>A|chilles</HI>'s
Choler, as <HI>Homer</HI> has repre&s;en|ted
it, for by that means I &s;hall entan|gle
my &s;elf in a great many Difficulties;
how &s;hall I repre&s;ent <HI>Achilles</HI> with his
Sword half drawn, and <HI>Minerva</HI> holding
him by the Arm to hinder his killing
<HI>Agamemnon;</HI> an Incident which is Mar|vellous
in an Epick Poem, and yet would
be ridiculous in a Tragedy. They who
read <HI>referre</HI> here in&s;tead of <HI>proferre,</HI> did
not under&s;tand the Pa&s;&s;age.</P>
<P>136. <HI>Nec &s;ic incipies.</HI>] He blames the
pompous Beginnings of &s;ome Tragedies,
when Poets, to give the Audience a great
Idea of their Performances begin Lofti|ly,
which is faulty &s;everal Ways; the
Beginning &s;hould be Simple and Mode&s;t.
This is a Rule in Epick Poetry, and
much more in Tragedy.</P>

was of the Number of tho&s;e Poets who
joyn'd in that Work, mention'd by the

of which is, That <HI>Homer,</HI> in his Poem

the Subject of the <HI>Ilias,</HI> 'tis only the Oc|ca&s;ion
of it. <HI>Homer</HI> makes no <HI>Beginning</HI> nor

hardly a <HI>Middle</HI> that's proper to it; but
he forgets none of the Parts of his

does not &s;o much as relate the Circum|&s;tances
of the Rape of <HI>Hellen,</HI> the Cau&s;e
of the War. <HI>Horace</HI> laught here at the
Author of the <HI>little Ilias,</HI> who began his

the breaking the <HI>&V;nity</HI> of the <HI>Acti|on,</HI>
which, as <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> teaches, mu&s;t be
always pre&s;erv'd: He condemns, in his
Art of Poetry, the Authors of the <HI>He|racliade</HI>
and <HI>The&s;eiade,</HI> for not ob&s;erving
that Unity, and &s;ets <HI>Homer</HI>'s Conduct
as an Example. He has not in his <HI>O|dy&s;&s;es</HI>
heap'd together all the Events
that happen'd to <HI>&V;ly&s;&s;es;</HI> nor in the <HI>Ilias</HI>
does he amu&s;e him&s;elf with writing the
Hi&s;tory of <HI>Achilles:</HI> He Introduces no
Adventure that has not Relation to
his Subject in either of the&s;e Poems.
<HI>Statius,</HI> after <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> and <HI>Horace</HI> had

what leads to it. The End of the <HI>Ilias</HI>
is <HI>Achilles</HI>'s Vengeance. <HI>Statius,</HI> in&s;tead
of going forward to the End of his

and flies back by <HI>Epi&s;odes,</HI> Independent
of his Subject.</P>
<P>149. <HI>Et in medias res, non &s;ecus ac no|tas,
auditorem rapit.</HI>] A Pa&s;&s;age of great
Importance, and very difficult: It has
been Interpreted, as if <HI>Horace</HI> would &s;ay,
that <HI>Homer</HI> pre&s;ently tran&s;ports his Rea|ders
to the Middle of his Subject, to
hold them always in De&s;ire and Hope
to the End of it. This, 'tis true, is
one of the greate&s;t Beauties of an <HI>E|pick</HI>
Poem, and <HI>Homer</HI> has not neglected
it, as <HI>Macrobius</HI> ob&s;erves in the IId
Chapter of the XVth Book of his <HI>Sa|turnalia;</HI>
but <HI>Horace</HI> having treated of
this Precept in the 42d and 43d Ver&s;es,
'tis not likely he &s;hould repeat it here:
Be&s;ides, <HI>Horace</HI> does not talk here of
what <HI>Homer</HI> does in the Beginning, but
what he does in the Sequel, thro' the
whole Cour&s;e of the Poem, as appears
plainly by what goes before, <HI>Semper ad
eventum fe&s;tinat, He always ha&s;ten'd to the
End of the Action.</HI> The true Sen&s;e of
this Pa&s;&s;age is, <HI>Homer</HI> carries his Rea|ders
&s;wiftly over all Things that prece|ded
the Action, he calls them <HI>medias
res,</HI> middle Things, either becau&s;e he
places the Recital of 'em in the Cour&s;e
of the Poem, after the Beginning, or
before the End; or becau&s;e they are
Things which the <HI>Greeks</HI> call properly
<GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, <HI>middling, indifferent. Horace</HI> &s;ays,
the Poet pa&s;&s;es &s;wiftly over tho&s;e Ad|ventures,
as if they were known: And
&s;uch is <HI>Homer</HI>'s con&s;tant Practice; every
thing that precedes the Siege of <HI>Troy,</HI>
and <HI>Achilles</HI>'s Vengeance, is related in the
Cour&s;e of the Poem, as publick Events
known to all the World: This a Tra|gick
Poet ought to ob&s;erve, as well as
an Epick. <HI>Sophocles,</HI> in his <HI>Oedipus,</HI> pa&s;|&s;es
&s;wiftly over every thing that pre|cedes
the Action of his Tragedy.</P>
<P>150. <HI>Et quae de&s;perat tractata nite&s;cere

one might from thence believe he gave
the whole Hi&s;tory. <HI>Horace</HI> &s;hews the
Poet's Addre&s;s, in not mentioning all
the Incidents of the Story, but making
a judicious Choice of them; leaving
tho&s;e that were not &s;u&s;ceptible of Or|naments,
&s;uitable to the Grandeur and

<P>151. <HI>Atque ita mentitur, &s;ic veris fal&s;a
remi&s;cet.</HI>] The Soul of an <HI>Epick</HI> Poem,
is the Fable, which includes a general
Truth, made particular by the Applica|tion
of Names. Thus the Truth con|tain'd
in the <HI>Ilias</HI> is, That Union and
Subordination pre&s;erve States, and that
Di&s;cord and Di&s;obedience de&s;troy them:
The Fiction in which this Truth is
wrapt up is the Quarrel between <HI>Achilles</HI>
and <HI>Agamemnon,</HI> feign'd to be taken
from a known Story as the <HI>Trojan</HI> War,
to make it the more probable. In E|pick
Poetry the Fiction goes always on
with the Truth; but 'tis not only Mo|ral
Truth that <HI>Homer</HI> teaches in his
Fictions, &s;ometimes al&s;o 'tis Phy&s;ical
and Hi&s;torical, which he enfolds in Fine
<HI>Fables,</HI> to render 'em the more Mar|vellous,
and con&s;equently the more A|greeable.
None has &s;ucceeded &s;o well
as him&s;elf in the&s;e <HI>Fables: Horace</HI> be|gins
this Precept with them, and con|tinues
it with the Mixture of the <HI>Fable
and the Truth. Sic veris fal&s;a remi&s;ce$.</HI>
Which is a perfect Explanation of <HI>Homer</HI>'s
Conduct, and all the My&s;tery of
an Epick Poem, according to <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI>'s

his <HI>Fable,</HI> which is not le&s;s a Fable than
any of <HI>Ae&s;op</HI>'s; <HI>mentitur, he feigns.</HI> After
he has laid down this <HI>Plan,</HI> he mu&s;t
make his Fable probable, and per&s;wade
that it has been done, to have it be|liev'd
that 'tis po&s;&s;ible. To this Pur|po&s;e
he attributes it to certain known
Per&s;ons; he names the Places that were
the Scene of it, all which he takes from
a known Story, borrowing &s;ome true
Actions and Circum&s;tances, which he ac|commodates
to his De&s;ign. <HI>Sic veris
fal&s;a remi&s;cet;</HI> tho&s;e Poets who have not,
like <HI>Homer,</HI> drawn the Plan of their
Poems, after they had &s;ought out &s;ome
Hero in Hi&s;tory, and cho&s;en a true
Action done by that Hero, have never
&s;ucceeded: As <HI>Silius, Statius, Lucan,</HI> and
among the <HI>Greeks</HI> the Authors of the
<HI>Heracliade</HI> and <HI>The&s;iade: Horace</HI> pre&s;cribes
this Rule in the XVIIIth Chapter of his
Art of Poetry, and it is the Foundation
of an Epick Poem.</P>
<P>152. <HI>Primo ne medium, medio ne di&s;|crepit

Fable with the Truth, that the three
Parts of his Subject may be Conne|cted
and Equal. The Middle, which is
the Knot, mu&s;t an&s;wer to the Beginning;
and the End, which is the Unravelling of
it, to the Beginning and Middle. If Fiction
is us'd in one Part, and not in all, the
Parts will be &s;o unequal and disjoynted
that they will not Compo&s;e one <HI>Whole:</HI>
Neither will the <HI>Marvellous,</HI> which is
produc'd more by Fiction than Truth,
reign thro' the Work as it ought to do.

the Stage, only horrible Ones, as
that of a Mother killing her Children;
nay it has been endeavour'd to be prov'd,
that Murders may be expos'd with Suc|ce&s;s
from the Practice of <HI>Ae&s;chylus, So|phocles,</HI>
and <HI>Euripides. E&s;chylus</HI> in his
<HI>Ceophores,</HI> kills <HI>Agamemnon, Prometheus</HI>
and <HI>Clytemne&s;tra,</HI> on the Stage. <HI>Soph$cles</HI>
does the &s;ame in his <HI>Electra,</HI> where <HI>O|re&s;tes</HI>
kills his Mother. And <HI>Euripides</HI>
in his <HI>Alce&s;te,</HI> who kills her on the
Stage. But this does not at all excu&s;e
the defiling it with Blood. Neither are
the&s;e Allegations of tho&s;e that defend it
True. <HI>Agamemnon</HI> is not kill'd in &s;ight
of the Audience, for the Chorus, who
hear his Cries in the Palace, re&s;olve to
enter to his A&s;&s;i&s;tance; and <HI>Prometheus</HI>
is carry'd off by a Tempe&s;t, which clo&s;es
the Scene. <HI>Scaliger</HI> is &s;trangely mi&s;taken
in this; e&s;pecially as to <HI>Clytemne&s;tra,</HI>
for &s;he's &s;o far from being kill'd in view
of the Spectators, that <HI>Ore&s;tes bids her
follow him, that he may kill her near the
Body of</HI> Egi&s;theus. In <HI>Sophocles, Ore|&s;tes</HI>'s
Mother is in the Palace when &s;he is
kill'd, as appears plainly by what <HI>Ele|ctra</HI>
&s;ays to her Deliverers, upon their re|entring
the Stage with their Hands
Bloody. True, <HI>Alce&s;te</HI> in <HI>Euripides</HI> does
Die on the Stage. But &s;he pines away;
her Woman cries out, <HI>She Langui&s;hes, &s;he
dies away with her Sickne&s;s.</HI> She was not
Wounded behind the Scenes. She Dy'd,
but was not kill'd on the Stage. In <HI>So|phocles,
Ajax</HI> is &s;aid to be kill'd on the
Stage, which is a Mi&s;take too; for the
Poet has with very great Addre&s;s plac'd
a Wood at the End of it, in which <HI>A|jax</HI>
is Murder'd, the Spectators not
&s;eeing it. <HI>Horace</HI> here puts <HI>Medea</HI> and
<HI>Atreus</HI> for all &s;orts of Tragick Stories.
For Murders cannot be allow'd on the
Stage, let 'em be of what Nature &s;oever.
None but bad Poets, who had not Ge$nius
enough to move by the Narration&punc;
have introduc'd Bloody Spectacles. <HI>Me|dea</HI>

<HI>Horace</HI> does not condemn it, but he$

different Nature of its Parts in particular,
which that of the <HI>Latins</HI> and Ours do not
do. By dividing Tragedy into Five
Acts, the Latin and Modern Poets di|vide
it into five like Parts, which is Vicious.

Objects. The Spectators would lo&s;e the
Idea of the whole, on Account of its
exce&s;&s;ive Bigne&s;s, wherefore the Ju&s;t
Medium lies in the five <HI>Acts.</HI> In which
there's Room for the variety of Inci|dents
nece&s;&s;ary for the Pa&s;&s;ions. Three
Acts are not to be born with in any
thing but Farces, which &s;upply the Places
of the <HI>Satyrs and Exodia</HI> of the Anci|ents.
Five Acts are &s;o e&s;&s;ential and ne|ce&s;&s;ary
to a Perfect Dramatick Poem,
that this Rule is not once broken by the
Greeks and Latins. <HI>Euripides</HI> ob&s;erves it
even in his <HI>Cyclops,</HI> a Satyrick Play, or
rather a Pa&s;toral, wherein he might have
taken more Liberty than in a regular
<HI>Tragedy.</HI> Yet tho' that Piece con&s;i&s;ts of
but 800 Ver&s;es, he has very exactly
mark'd the Divi&s;ion of five <HI>Acts. Mar|cus
Antoninus</HI> has this Rule in View,
when he compares Life to a Theatrical
Piece. He is comforting a Young Man
who was Dying, and an&s;wers him, <HI>I have
not yet fini&s;h'd the Five Acts, I have play'd
but Three. But in Life,</HI> reply'd the Em|peror,
<HI>Three Acts are a Compleat Play.</HI>
If it is objected that Mon&s;ieur <HI>Racine</HI>
wrote a Play of Three Acts; tho' we
mu&s;t not accu&s;e him as ignorant of the
Rules of his Art, we may very well con|clude
he did not intend an entirely Re|gular
Play. He was not willing to leave
his Story, which in its Simplicity could
not ea&s;ily furni&s;h out five Acts, and
thought much more of pre&s;erving the
Holine&s;s and Maje&s;ty of the Original,
than by multiplying Incidents to give
it a ju&s;t Extent.</P>
<P>191. <HI>Nec Deus inter&s;it, ni&s;i dignus vin|dice
nodus.</HI>] The Tragick Poets were
blam'd of Old for that, when they cou'd
not unravel their Plots, they had re|cour&s;e
to a Divinity, who came in a Ma|chine
and did it for them, as is done
in the <HI>Medea</HI> of <HI>Euripides.</HI> This Rule
is taken from <HI>Ari&s;totle,</HI> who does not,
however, quite exclude Machines, but
&s;uch only as are not born of the Subject,
either nece&s;&s;arily or probably; and this
is the True Sentiment of <HI>Horace,</HI> who
&s;ays, Machines &s;hould never be made u&s;e
of, but when the Knot de&s;erves that a
God &s;hould come to untie it. We read
in <HI>Ari&s;totle,</HI> Chap. XVI. <HI>In the Man|ners,
as well as in the Di&s;po&s;ition of the
Subject, the Poet mu&s;t have a Regard to
what's either Nece&s;&s;ary or Probable, &s;o that
the Events may happen either nece&s;&s;arily or
probably. From whence 'tis evident that
the &V;nravelling the Plot ought to be pro|duc'd
by the Plot it &s;elf, without making
u&s;e of the help of a Machine, as in the
Medea.</HI> This relates only to Dramatick
Poetry, for in <HI>Epick</HI> Machines are ab|&s;olutely
nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P><HI>Dignus vindice nodus.</HI>] A happy Ex|pre&s;&s;ion
taken from the <HI>Roman</HI> Law,
which calls a Man <HI>Vindicem,</HI> who &s;ets a
Slave at Liberty. Thus <HI>Horace</HI> looks on
an entangled Piece, as a Slave that &s;tands
in need of a God to come and &s;et him
at Liberty.</P>
<P>192. <HI>Nec quarta loqui per&s;ona laboret.</HI>] The
Ancient Tragick Poets &s;eldom introduc'd
above Two Per&s;ons &s;peaking in a Scene,
Three were rarely to be met with, and
Four hardly ever. So <HI>Diomedes</HI> writes,
<HI>In Graeco Dramate fere tres per&s;onae&s;olae
agunt.</HI> But it may happen there may
be Occa&s;ion for Four to &s;peak. Mon&s;ieur
<HI>D'Aubignac</HI> pretends <HI>Horace</HI> does not en|tirely
condemn the introducing a Fourth
Per&s;on, but that a Fourth Per&s;on &s;hou'd
not force him&s;elf to &s;peak. The Text
will bear &s;uch a Con&s;truction, and our
Poets have added a Fifth to this Fourth
Per&s;on. Nay <HI>Scaliger</HI> in the IIId Book
of his <HI>Art of Poetry,</HI> &s;ays, <HI>They make no
Scruple of bringing a Fourth Per&s;on into
a Scene. As</HI> Ari&s;tophanes'<HI>s Gho&s;t in the
Froggs, the &s;ame in his</HI> Plutus <HI>and in his
Birds.</HI> However what <HI>Scaliger</HI> &s;ays of
<HI>Ari&s;tophanes</HI> does not decide the Di&s;pute.
For <HI>Horace</HI> talks of <HI>Tragedy,</HI> and not of
<HI>Comedy,</HI> in which no Body que&s;tions a
great deal more Liberty may be taken.
'Tis very likely <HI>Horace's</HI> Rule is Simple,
and without Re&s;triction, drawn from the
Common Practice of the <HI>Greeks,</HI> and its
being the mo&s;t convenient, the mo&s;t Na|tural,
and the mo&s;t Safe Way. <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI>
informs us, <HI>E&s;chylus</HI> invented a Principal
Per&s;on, which he joyn'd to him who ap|pear'd
between the Songs of the Chorus,
and that <HI>Sophecles</HI> added a Third. Ne|verthele&s;s
there are Three Actors to be
met with in &s;ome of <HI>E&s;chylus</HI>'s Plays.
<PB N="271" REF="288">
See the Remarks on the IVth Chapter
of that Philo&s;opher's <HI>Art of Poetry.</HI></P>
<P>193. <HI>Actoris partes chorus, officiumque virile
defendat.</HI>] The Chorus were a Company
of Actors, who &s;upply'd the Place of
tho&s;e who ought probably to be pre&s;ent
at the Action repre&s;ented, and were con|cern'd
in it. 'Twas the Foundation of
all the Probability of Dramatick Poetry,
which &s;ince it has lo&s;t its Chorus has
lo&s;t at lea&s;t half of its Veri&s;imility and
greate&s;t Ornament, rendring our Modern
Tragedy no more than the Shadow of
the Ancient. The <HI>Chorus</HI> had two Fun|ctions.
For in the Cour&s;e of the <HI>Acts,</HI>
they were to join in the Action, and act
a Part, the <HI>Coriphaus</HI> &s;peaking alone in
the Name of all the re&s;t, and after each
Act all the <HI>Chorus</HI> was to Note the In|terval
by their Songs. <HI>Horace</HI> pre&s;cribes
here two Rules for the&s;e two Functi|ons
of the <HI>Chorus.</HI> The fir&s;t is contain'd
in this Ver&s;e,
<Q>Actoris Partes Chorus officiumque virile de|fendat.</Q></P>
<P>The Chorus mu&s;t act the Part of an A|ctor,
and perform the Functions of a &s;ingle
Per&s;on. '<HI>Tis a Tran&s;lation or Explana|tion
of a Pa&s;&s;age in</HI> Ari&s;totle's Art of
Poetry, <HI>wherein 'tis &s;aid,</HI> The Chorus mu&s;t
Act the Part of an Actor, be one of the
Per&s;ons of the Place, and make a Part of
the whole. <HI>The Second Function is con|tain'd
in the following Remarks.</HI></P>
<P>194. <HI>Ne quid medios intercinat actus,
quod non propo&s;ito conducat.</HI>] What the
Chorus &s;ung between the <HI>Acts</HI> to mark
the <HI>Intervals:</HI> Which Song <HI>Horace</HI> will
have to agree with the Subject, that is,
be taken from it, and help to the for|warding
it. <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> &s;ays, <HI>Sophocles</HI> and
<HI>Euripides</HI> &s;hould be imitated in this; and
tho&s;e who do otherwi&s;e, <HI>incerta canunt,
&s;ing in&s;erted Songs,</HI> as &s;uitable to one
Tragedy as another. <HI>Sophocles</HI> is the
true Model for the Con&s;titution of Cho|rus's:
<HI>Euripides</HI> was &s;ometimes deficient
in this, tho' <HI>Scaliger</HI> prefers his Con|duct
to <HI>Sophocles</HI>'s; <HI>Ari&s;tophanes</HI> blames
<HI>Euripides</HI> for it, in his <HI>Acharnen&s;es, And
tho&s;e,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>who Compo&s;e his Chorus
&s;tand there like Fools:</HI> Upon which the
<HI>Scholia&s;t</HI> makes this Judicious Remark,
Ari&s;tophanes <HI>in this Ver&s;e laughs at</HI> Eu|ripides
<HI>for introducing Chorus's that do not
&s;ing Things agreeable to the Subject, but
Stories that are Foreign to it,</HI> as in his
<HI>Phoenicians.</HI></P>
<P>196. <HI>Ille bonis faveatque.</HI>] In the&s;e &s;ix
Ver&s;es <HI>Horace</HI> tells us what was the Bu|&s;ine&s;s
of the <HI>Chorus: Scaliger</HI> forgets a
great deal of it. The Chorus always
took the Part of Hone&s;t Men; the Thea|tre
was then the School of Piety and
Ju&s;tice better taught there than in the
Temples. <HI>Et concilietur amicts.</HI> Some
have read <HI>&amp; con&s;ilietur amicis,</HI> to give
Council to its Friends: That was indeed
one of the Duties of the Chorus; but
I que&s;tion whether there are any In&s;tan|ces
of <HI>con&s;iliari,</HI> to expre&s;s giving Coun|&s;el;
'till I meet with one I will rather
chu&s;e to read <HI>&amp; concilietur amicis,</HI> that is
it joyn'd with its Friends, and &s;upported
their Intere&s;ts.</P>
<P>197. <HI>Et regat iratos.</HI>] As in <HI>Oedipus,</HI>
the Chorus endeavours to moderate that
Prince's Choler again&s;t <HI>Tire&s;ias,</HI> and <HI>Ti|re&s;ias</HI>'s
again&s;t him.</P>
<P><HI>Et amet peccare timentes.</HI>] The Cho|rus
was &s;o Religious that it always de|clar'd
for the Innocent again&s;t the
Guilty.</P>
<P>198. <HI>Ille dapes laudet men&s;ae brevis.</HI>]
The Chorus of Tragedy may have fre|quent
Occa&s;ions to commend Sobriety,
one of the principal Moral Virtues.</P>
<P>199. <HI>Ille &s;alubrem, ju&s;titiam, lege&s;que.</HI>]
The Chorus of <HI>Oedipus</HI> furni&s;hes us with
wonderful Examples of what <HI>Horace</HI>
writes on this Subject.</P>
<P><HI>Et apertis otia portis.</HI>] As in that fine
Chorus of <HI>Euripides,</HI> when addre&s;&s;ing to
the Queen of Peace, it &s;ays,
<Q><L>Queen of Riches, happy Peace,</L>
<L>Faire&s;t of the Godde&s;&s;es;</L>
<L>With what Impatience have I waited,</L>
<L>How long expected you in vain?</L>
<L>I fear Old Age will now de&s;troy me</L>
<L>Before I &s;hall behold your Beauty,</L>
<L>Before your Dances I behold</L>
<L>So full of Grace, before I &s;ee</L>
<L>Your Crowns, your Fea&s;ts, and hear your
Songs.</L></Q></P>
<P>200. <HI>Ille tegat commi&s;&s;a.</HI>] The mo&s;t
E&s;&s;ential Qualities of the Chorus, are
<PB N="272" REF="289">
Fidelity and Secrecy, without which all
Veri&s;imility is lo&s;t, and the Poem &s;poilt.
The&s;e Qualities depend on the Poet's
Addre&s;s, who ought &s;o to chu&s;e his Chorus,
that its own Intere&s;t may engage it to
Conceal what it is entru&s;ted with, and
to take care, that in concealing it,
it does nothing again&s;t its Duty. <HI>Eu|ripides</HI>
has committed a Fault of this
Kind&punc; in his <HI>Medea,</HI> who tho' a Stranger
at <HI>Cerimb,</HI> contrives the Death of her
Rival the King of <HI>Corinth's</HI> Daughter,
as al&s;o that of the King, and after|wards
to Kill her own Children, tells
the Chorus, compos'd of <HI>Corinthian</HI> Wo|men,
the King's Subjects, her De&s;ign,
and yet they are &s;o Faithful to this Fo|reigner,
that they do not di&s;cover it to
their Natural Prince. The Chorus, 'tis
time, mu&s;t be <HI>faithful,</HI> but without vio|lating
the Laws of Nature, or the Laws
of God: The Fidelity of the <HI>Corinthian</HI>
Women to <HI>Media</HI> is Criminal; the <HI>Greek</HI>
Scholia&s;ts endeavours to excu&s;e it, by &s;ay|ing,
that the <HI>Corinthian</HI> Women being
Free, declar'd for Ju&s;tice, as Chorus's
ought to do, which Excu&s;e is ridiculous
and impious; and the &s;ame <HI>Euripides,</HI>
who has made this <HI>Chorinthian</HI> Chorus &s;o
faithful, when it &s;hould not have been
&s;o, makes the Chorus of <HI>Creu&s;a's</HI> Wait|ing
Women in <HI>ION,</HI> fail in their Fide|lity
to <HI>Xuthus,</HI> and reveal her Husband's
Secret to their Mi&s;tre&s;s, tho' he had
Commanded them, on Pain of Death,
not to do it. <HI>H$race</HI>'s Rule is, indeed,
not &s;o General, but it may admit of
&s;ome Exception; but I can much le&s;s
forgive <HI>Euripides</HI> for the Treachery com|mitted
in <HI>Ip$igenia</HI> in <HI>Tauris;</HI> the Chorus
is compos'd of <HI>Grecian</HI> Women, and this
Prince&s;s begs them to tell no Body of
her Plot to carry off the Statue of <HI>Di|a$a,</HI>
promi&s;ing to take them with her.
The Women are Faithful to her, and
yet &s;he flies away alone with <HI>Ore&s;tes,</HI> and
abandons them to the Rage of <HI>Thoas,</HI>
who would certainly have &s;everely pun|i&s;h'd
them, had not <HI>Minerva</HI> come to
their Deliverance.</P>
<P>201. <HI>&V;t$$redeat mi&s;eris, abeat fortuna
&s;uper$is.</HI>] A nece&s;&s;ary Con&s;equence of
the Ju&s;tice and Piety of the Chorus;
the Ancients blame <HI>Euripides,</HI> becau&s;e
his Chorus's are not always &s;o much
concern'd as they ought to be, for the
Unhappy. <HI>Sophocles</HI> never err'd once in
this Particular.</P>

The eighteen following Ver&s;es are Ob|&s;cure.
After having &s;poken of the Cho|rus's
in Tragedy, he &s;peaks of the
Changes that had happen'd in the Mu|&s;ick,

Explain it, makes u&s;e of a very ju&s;t Ex|ample,
&s;aying, that as the Chorus's of
the <HI>R$mans</HI> Plays, which were at fir&s;t
plain, with one verry little Flute, and
without any Ornament, chang$d the
Tone when the <HI>Roman</HI> People began
to be more Powerful and Rich, Riches
and Luxury having introduc'd the &s;ame
Change in Ver&s;e and Mu&s;ick, as in Man|ners;

the Chorus of the <HI>Greek Tragedies,</HI> the
Mu&s;ick of which was at fir&s;t as Plain as
the Ver&s;e, but by degrees it became more
Harmonious and Strong, and the Mea|&s;ure

<HI>where they began, which in their Subject
and Raillery are entirely like the &s;atyrick
Pieces of the</HI> Greeks; the only difference
being, in the latter, Satyrs or other Re|diculous
Actors were introduc'd, as <HI>Au|tolycus,
Burris,</HI> &amp;c. and in the <HI>Attellanes,</HI>
ob&s;cene Actors, as <HI>Marcus:</HI> If <HI>Diomedes</HI>

the four Tragedies written on the
Adventures of <HI>Ore&s;tes.</HI> There were al&s;o
<HI>Tetralogies,</HI> where the four Pieces were
written on different Subjects: We read
of a <HI>Tetralogie</HI> of <HI>Euripides,</HI> which con|&s;i&s;ted
of four Plays, on &s;o many different
Fables; as the <HI>Medea,</HI> the <HI>Philoctetes,</HI>

had no <HI>Tetralogies:</HI> They wrote a
Tragedy, and an <HI>Attellane,</HI> on the &s;ame
Hero; the &s;ame Actor appear'd in both;
for which Rea&s;on <HI>Horace</HI> carefully re|commends

<HI>Meane&s;s</HI> of <HI>Comedy:</HI> The <HI>Romans</HI> had
&s;omething like <HI>Tetralog$es,</HI> they had
three Plays acted, one after another,

Tragedy; the &s;econd the <HI>Attellane;</HI> the
third a <HI>Satyr</HI> or Exode, a kind of Fa$ce

the Grave and Serious Part of the

The Old Comedy was of two &s;orts;
that which was properly &s;o call'd, in
which was no Fable, the Poets reprov'd
Vice openly, and &s;par'd neither Citizens
not Magi&s;trates, who&s;e Names, and e|ven
the Likne&s;s of their Faces, they
brought on the Stage. But when <HI>Ly|&s;ander</HI>

and chang'd the Government from
a Democracy into an Ari&s;tocracy, put|ting
it into the Hands of the <HI>Thirty Ty|rants,</HI>
&s;uch a Liberry which was not
compatible with Tyranny, di&s;pleas'd, and
the Poets were forbidden to Name tho&s;e

Names were then us'd, but the
Characters &s;o well painted, that the Per|&s;ons

not mean <HI>Tragedy</HI> by <HI>proetextas,</HI> and <HI>Co|medy</HI>

Togatae</HI> is the Genius which comprehends
the two Kinds of <HI>Roman</HI> Comedies,
<HI>praetextae</HI> is one of the <HI>Species</HI> compre|hended
under the <HI>Genius,</HI> wherefore they
are here <HI>Togatae,</HI> and con&s;eqnently <HI>Co|medies</HI>
and not <HI>Tragedies;</HI> &s;ince Trage|dies
were never call'd <HI>Togatae.</HI> As the
<HI>Comedies</HI> who&s;e Stories were taken from
the <HI>Greek</HI> were call'd <HI>palli$tae:</HI> So the
<HI>Comedies</HI> who&s;e Stories were <HI>Roman</HI> were
call'd <HI>togatae:</HI> A general Name given
tho&s;e <HI>Roman</HI> Plays, becau&s;e the <HI>Toga</HI>
was the Habit of the <HI>Romans,</HI> as the
<HI>Pallium</HI> was that of the <HI>Greeks.</HI> There
were two Kinds of this <HI>Togatae,</HI> and the&s;e
two Kinds &s;ubdivided into two other,
each of which had a Name given it ac|cording
to its Subject and Actors. Tho&s;e
Comedies who&s;e Subjects were Grave, and
their Actors repre&s;ented the chief Per|&s;on
in the State, were called <HI>Praetextae,</HI>
from the Habit <HI>praetextae</HI> wore by the Ma|gi&s;trates,
the Robe edg'd with <HI>Purple;</HI>
tho&s;e that were le&s;s Grave, and repre|&s;ented
Inferior Per&s;ons, were term'd <HI>to|gatae.
Meli&s;&s;us</HI> invented a Third Sort,
<HI>Trabeates,</HI> from their repre&s;enting Sol|diers
and Knights, who&s;e Habit was cal|led
<HI>Trae$e,</HI> The Comedies below the&s;e, re|pre&s;enting
the Actions of the Meaner
People, were term'd <HI>Tabernaria.</HI> There are
none of the&s;e Plays extant, neither the
<HI>Praetextae</HI> not <HI>Togatae.</HI> There were Poets
for each Kind, as <HI>Afranius Titinius</HI> and
<HI>Quintius Alta,</HI> who wrote <HI>Togatas;</HI> and
<HI>Pacuvius</HI> and <HI>Accius,</HI> who wrote the <HI>Prae|textae.</HI>
The former were reckon'd true
Comick Poets, as <HI>Horace</HI> &s;ays in the I&s;t
Epi&s;tle of the IId Book.</P>
<Q>Dicitur Afrani toga conveni&s;&s;e Menandre.</Q>
<P>He afterwards places <HI>Atta</HI> among the
Comick Poets. <HI>Pacuvius</HI> and <HI>Accius</HI> wrote
the Plays call'd <HI>Praetextae,</HI> Comedies of
a more &s;erious Ca&s;t. The two latter
have been &s;til'd Tragick Poets, <HI>Traga|diae
Scriptores Accius atque Pacuvius cla|ri&s;&s;imi;</HI>
and con&s;equently the&s;e <HI>Praetextae</HI>
have been thought to be Tragedies; but
they were not call'd Tragick Poets for
their <HI>Praetextae,</HI> but for <HI>Tragedies</HI> written
by them. <HI>Pacuvius</HI> wrote <HI>Anoby&s;es, An|tiope,</HI>
&amp;c. <HI>Accius, Achilles, Aegifthe|us,
Alcef$e,</HI> &amp;c. which were real Trage|dies.
The <HI>Praetextae</HI> Pieces of <HI>Pacuvius</HI>
were <HI>Paulus, Tunicularia;</HI> and <HI>Accius</HI>'s
<HI>Brutus,</HI> and <HI>Decius.</HI> Their Names &s;hew
they were &s;erious Pieces that came very
near <HI>Tragedy;</HI> tho' they were in Effect
true Comedy: They treated of true
Facts, mixing the Gay and the Serious
together. In a Letter of <HI>Polli$'s</HI> to <HI>Ci|cer$,</HI>

<HI>Balbus,</HI> a very In&s;olent Man, had

Ethicks better than all the re&s;t of

the&s;e are Oraters, Generals, and Magi&s;trates

Poets, Mu&s;icians, and Phy&s;icians.
Horace</HI> confines him&s;elf particularly to
<HI>Ethicks,</HI> which <HI>Socrates</HI> handled better
that any other Philo&s;opher; and no|thing
is more nece&s;&s;ary to a Poet than
Moral Philo&s;ophy in forming his Cha|racters.

Manners we &s;ee on the Stage of

<P><HI>Doctum imitatorem.] Imitator,</HI> for <HI>Poet;</HI>
Poetry being an Imitation only, as <HI>Ari|&s;totle</HI>

<P>318. <HI>Et veras hinc ducere voces.</HI>] Both
<HI>Poetry</HI> and <HI>Painting</HI> are pure Imitations.
A <HI>Painter</HI> who draws a Beautiful Wo|man,
after the mo&s;t Beautiful Life, can|not
pretend to draw a true <HI>Picture</HI> of
Beauty, for his <HI>Piece</HI> is only a Copy of
another <HI>Piece,</HI> an Imitation of an Image,
and not of the Truth, as <HI>Plato</HI> &s;ays, his
Strokes are not <HI>verae lineae,</HI> but <HI>lineae &s;i|mulatae,
adumbratae:</HI> He has not con&s;ulted

if a <HI>Poet</HI> would repre&s;ent a Mi&s;er,
and paints only the Avarice of &s;uch or

the <HI>Shadow</HI> for the <HI>Sub&s;tance,</HI> the <HI>Image</HI>
for the <HI>Truth;</HI> he mu&s;t ca&s;t his Eyes

Rule in the XVth Capter of his Art of
Poetry, rather to form Characters after
Nature than after <HI>Particulars:</HI> In the
latter we may find what <HI>Choler</HI> has done,
in Nature what Choler ought and might
probably do, which embelli&s;hes the Cha|racter,

Mouldy or Worm-Eaten. Pliny</HI> tells us,

<P>396. <HI>Fuit haec &s;apientia quendam publica

properly Philo&s;ophers, who made u&s;e of
Poetry the better to in&s;inuare them&s;elves
in$o Men's Minds, and &s;hew them how
to di&s;tingui&s;h publick and private Good,

<P>401. <HI>Po&s;t hos in&s;ignis Homerus.</HI>] Poetry
in the Second Age took another Cour&s;e,
to elevate Men's Courage, and qualify
them to &s;erve their Country, it &s;ung
the Deeds of Heroes. <HI>Hemer</HI> and <HI>Tyrtaeus</HI>
began the Second Age.</P>
<P>402. <HI>Tyrt$$&s;que.</HI>] He was a School|ma&s;ter,
Little, Ugly, Limping, and One
Ey'd; the <HI>Athenians</HI> gave him by way of
Deri&s;ion to the <HI>Spartans,</HI> wao by Order
of <HI>Pythian Apollo</HI> demanded a General
of them, to lead them again&s;t the <HI>Me&s;|&s;ecians,</HI>
which he did, and was beaten
by the <HI>Me&s;&s;enians</HI> in three &s;everal Battles.
This &s;o reduc'd the <HI>Spartans,</HI> that they
were forc'd to Li&s;t their Slaves, and
promi&s;e them the Wives of the Slain.
The Kings of <HI>Sparta,</HI> di&s;courag'd by &s;o
many Lo&s;&s;es, would have return'd Home,
but <HI>Tyrtaeus</HI> repeating &s;ome Ver&s;es of his
at the Head of the Army, &s;o ammated
the Soldiers that they fell on the E|nemy
and rouled them. Some of the&s;e
Ver&s;es are &s;till extant. Thus was about
680 Years before Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>403. <HI>Dicte per carmina &s;ortes.] Horace</HI>

of Poetry. <HI>Ari&s;tophanes,</HI> with more Rea|&s;on,
puts them in the Fir&s;t: Oracles be|ing
more Ancient than <HI>Homer.</HI> Perhaps
he means, that the Fir&s;t Oracles were
deliver'd in Pro&s;e, and afterwards in
Ver&s;e only, which is true.</P>
<P>404. <HI>Et vitae mon&s;trata via e&s;t.</HI>] This
has Reference to <HI>Phy&s;icks,</HI> and not <HI>E|thicks.</HI>
Poetry in the Second Age began
to explain in Ver&s;e the Secrets of Na|ture
<HI>Vitae</HI> for <HI>Naturae.</HI> Nature that gives
Life to all Things.</P>

<P>408. <HI>Natura fieret laudabile carmen, an
arte quae&s;itum e&s;t.</HI>] He does not forget
the Grand Que&s;tion. Whether Poetry
comes from Nature or Art. <HI>Horace,</HI> to
hinder the <HI>Pi&s;o's</HI> tru&s;ting wholly to their
Genius, determines it, that Nature and
Art &s;hould always go together. Nature,
'tis true, is the Ba&s;is of all, as <HI>Horace</HI>
owns in the Third and Sixth Odes of
the IVth Book. Nature alone is pre|ferable
to Art alone, but joyn'd toge|ther
it makes Perfection. Nature gives
a Facility; Art, Method and Safety. <HI>Art
certior quam Natura,</HI> &s;ays <HI>Cicero;</HI> and <HI>Lon|ginus</HI>
ob&s;erves, that as free as Nature
appears, &s;he does nothing good at a ven|ture.
and is no Enemy to Rule$. Na|ture
without Art is Blind, and Ra&s;h;
Art without Nature, Rude, Barren and
Dry. <HI>Quintilian</HI> has it, <HI>We believe there's
nothing Per$ect, but what is produc'd by
Nature, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by Art.</HI> Art is never
&s;o perfect as when it imitates Nature.
Nature never &s;ucceeds &s;o well, as when
it conceals Art.</P>
<P>410. <HI>Nec rude quid pr$&s;it Ingenium.]
Rude Ingenium.</HI> A Genius, which tho'
happy of its &s;elf, is always Rude when
not poli&s;h'd by Art.</P>
<P>412. <HI>Qui &s;tudet optatam cur&s;u contingere
m$$am.</HI>] He proves by Examples, that
there is nothing where Nature alone
<PB N="291" REF="308">
&s;uffices, and where there's no Occa&s;ion
of Art. The <HI>Prize-Fighters</HI> not only la|bour'd

this Law of Labour? No Man will ever
make a good Poet without it.</P>
<P>413. <HI>Puer.</HI>] They began the&s;e Exer|ci&s;es
very Young.</P>
<P>414. <HI>Qui Pythia cantat tibicen.] Horace</HI>
does not mean <HI>Pythick</HI> Games, they were
then out of U&s;e, but the Players on
the Flute in the Ancient Chorus's of
Comedies. When all the Chorus
&s;ung, one of them play'd to accompany
the Song, who was thence call'd <HI>Choraule.</HI>
And after their Songs were done, there
was another Player on the Flute, who
play'd &s;ingly to what was Sung &s;ingly; and
this la&s;t was termed <HI>Pythaule,</HI> a <HI>Player
for</HI> Pythian <HI>Songs;</HI> which were like Po|ems

City of <HI>Pytho. Diomed$s</HI> &s;ays, <HI>When the
Chorus &s;ung, the Players on the Flute ac|company'd

Chorus Flute, and an&s;wer'd with the Py|thick
Flute, to the Single Songs.</HI> The&s;e
<HI>Pythaules</HI> and <HI>Choraules,</HI> who were of old
part of the Band of Mu&s;icians in the
Dramatick Repre&s;entations, &s;eparated af|terwards
and play'd by them&s;elves. There
were &s;ome of the&s;e Ma&s;ters very famous,
and of the&s;e <HI>Horace</HI> &s;peaks.</P>
<P>415. <HI>Didicit prius, extimuitque Magi|&s;trum.</HI>]
There never was an Eminent
Player on the Flute, who had not &s;erv'd
an Apprentice&s;hip; wherefore &s;ince
Nature is not &s;ufficient for Little Things,
how &s;hould &s;he &s;uffice for Great?</P>
<P>416. <HI>Nunc &s;atis e&s;t dixi&s;&s;e, Ego mira

<P>451. <HI>Hae nugae &s;eria ducent in mala.]

made a Fool of him, by deceiving him
with fal&s;e Prai&s;e; he would prove that it
is the Cau&s;e of all his Misfortunes, be|cau&s;e

Poetry.</P>

quoted by <HI>Ari&s;totle:</HI> He al&s;o wrote on
<HI>Xerxes's</HI> Expedition; but his Daughter or
Si&s;ter burnt that Piece: He flouri&s;h'd a|bout

Word <HI>frigidus</HI> has been variou&s;ly, ex|pounded;

Horace</HI> would de&s;cribe all the Extrava|gance
of a Madman, who to get the

There's no likelyhood <HI>Horace</HI>

Others that fall into Melancholy may
be cur'd; 'tis to be hop'd they will
grow wi&s;er, as it happen'd to <HI>Dama&s;ippus,

<L>OF Things in which Mankind does mo&s;t excel,</L>

<L>And of all Writings, <HI>Sacred Poe&s;ie</HI></L>
<L>Shines mo&s;t Sublime to a di&s;cerning Eye:</L>
<L>No kind of Work requires &s;o <HI>nice</HI> a touch,</L>

<L>But, oh, far be it from Records of Fame,</L>

<L>Dazling our Minds, &s;ets off the &s;lighte&s;t Rhimes;</L>
<L>Bright as a Blaze, but in a Moment done;</L>
<L>True Wit is everla&s;ting, like the Sun;</L>

Which tho' &s;ometimes behind a Cloud retir'd,</L>

<L>For all in vain the&s;e &s;uperficial parts</L>

<HEAD>The ARGUMENT.</HEAD>
<P>The Poet in this Satyr fir&s;t brings in <HI>Cri&s;pinus,</HI>
whom he had a La&s;h at in his fir&s;t Satyr, and
whom he promi&s;es here not to be forgetful of for
the future. He expo&s;es his mon&s;trous Prodiga|lity
and Luxury in giving the Price of an E|&s;tate
for a Barbel: and from thence takes Occa|&s;ion
to introduce the principal Subject, and true
De&s;ign of this Satyr, which is grounded upon a
ridiculous Story of a Turbut pre&s;ented to <HI>Do|mitian,</HI>
of &s;o va&s;t a Bigne&s;s, that all the Em|peror's
Scullery had not a Di&s;h large enough to
hold it: &V;pon which the Senate in all ha&s;te is
&s;ummon'd, to con&s;ult in this Exigency, what is
fitte&s;t to be done. The Poet gives us a Parti|cular
of the Senators Names, their di&s;tinct Cha|racters,
and Speeches, and Advice; and after
much and wi&s;e Con&s;ultation, an Expedient being
found out and agreed upon, he di&s;mi&s;&s;es the Se|nate,
and concludes the Satyr.</P>
