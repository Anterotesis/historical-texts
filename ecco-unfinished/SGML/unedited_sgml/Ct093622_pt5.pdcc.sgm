<P>THE plan of this Collection having been alrea|dy &s;ubmitted to the reader, little remains but to apologize for delay, which, it is hoped, has pro|duced improvement. The fifth and &s;ixth volumes might have appeared in 1780; but it was thought more advi&s;eable to wait till the work was entirely completed.</P>
<P>It cannot but be a plea&s;ing &s;atisfaction to the Editor to find that what he has laid before the publick has attracted the notice of many gentlemen, who&s;e prai&s;e is real fame, and who have &s;hewn their approbation by communications which in no &s;mall degree adorn the pre&s;ent volumes.</P>
<P>That the biographical notes<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The extract in the former Adverti&s;ement, from a Dia|logue of PRIOR, will be illu&s;trated by the following quo|tation from a Writer as amiable as he is learned, and by who&s;e kind hints the pre&s;ent Collection has been con&s;idera|bly benefited: "I have lately been permitted to read a cu|rious manu&s;cript, now in the hands of her Grace the Duche&s;s Dowager of Portland, containing E&s;&s;ays and Dialogues of the Dead, on the following &s;ubjects, by Prior. 1. Heads for a Treati&s;e on Learning. 2. E&s;&s;ay on Opinion. 3. A Dialogue betwixt Charles the Fifth and Clenard the Grammarian. 4. Betwixt Locke and Montague. 5. The Vicar of Bray and Sir Thomas More. 6. Oliver Cromwell and his Porter. If the&s;e pieces were publi&s;hed, Prior would appear to be as good a pro&s;e writer as poet.&mdash;Some valuable memoirs of his life, written by the Hon. Mr. Montagu, his friend, are al&s;o in p$&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Duche&s;s Dowager of Portland."</P>
<BIBL>Dr. WARTON, <HI>E&s;&s;ay on Pope</HI>, vol. II. p. 482.</BIBL>
<P>The anonymous Imitation of Anacreon, which is printed in p. 155. of this volume, I &s;ince perceive, is attributed to Prior, in the late Collection of the Engli&s;h Poets, vol. XXXI. p. 250.</P></NOTE> have been acceptable, is evident from their having occa&s;ioned a new edition of Mr. DODSLEY's Poems on a &s;imilar plan.</P>
<P><PB N="iv" REF="4">Among the poems now exhibited are &s;ome valuable originals, and a number of academical ver&s;es by &s;ome of the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed &s;cholars of this kingdom.&mdash; If to the&s;e the Editor has added a few of his own ju|venile attempts at ver&s;ification, he hopes to &s;tand ex|cu&s;ed for the pre&s;umption. They are not numerous, and will at lea&s;t &s;erve as a foil to the beauties with which they are &s;urrounded.</P>
<P>A variety of avocations having prevented the Editor from attending to the Index, that laborious office has been kindly undertaken by Mr. MACBEAN, who&s;e abilities in that line had been before exerted in Dr. JOHNSON's edition of the Engli&s;h Poets.</P>
<P>A &s;hort Index to the Notes preceded the former publication; another is here annexed.</P>

<HEAD>EPIGRAM, BY BP. ATTERBURY<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Francis Atterbury, born March 6, 1662, was educated at We&s;tmin&s;ter; and in 1680 was elected a &s;tudent of Chri&s;t-Church. In 1693 he applied to the earl of Nottingham, to &s;uc|ceed to his father's rectory of Milton in Bucks; but, being un&s;uc|ce&s;sful, came to London: where he was &s;oon di&s;tingui&s;hed, appointed chaplain to king William, and elected preacher at Bridewell, and lecturer of St. Bride's; which la&s;t office he re&s;igned in December 1698. In 1700 he was made arch|deacon of Totne&s;s, by Sir Jonathan Trelawney bi&s;hop of Exeter; and, entering deeply into the famous controver&s;y concerning the convocation again&s;t Dr. Wake dean of Exeter, was created doctor in divinity in a manner which did him &s;in|gular honour. On the acce&s;&s;ion of queen Anne, he was made one of her chaplains; and in October 1704, dean of Carli&s;le; in 1707, canon re&s;identiary of Exeter; in 1700, preacher at The Rolls. In 1710 he was unanimou&s;ly cho&s;en prolocutor of the lower hou&s;e of convocation; in 1711 made dean of Chri&s;t-Church, Oxford; in the beginning of June 1713, advanced to the bi&s;hoprick of Roche&s;ter and deanry of We&s;tmin&s;ter. He officiated, as dean, at the coronation of king George the Fir&s;t; when he received from his maie&s;ty &s;ome marks of per|&s;onal di&s;like, owing probably to his having warmly e&s;pou&s;ed the cau&s;e of Sacheverell, who&s;e defence he penned (in con|cert with Dr. Smalridge), and from whom he afterwards re|ceived a legacy of five hundred pounds. In 1715 he refu&s;ed to &s;ign the declaration publi&s;hed by the Bi&s;hops again&s;t the rebellion, and was ever afterward in oppo&s;ition to the court. He was apprehended on &s;u&s;picion of trea&s;on, and committed to The Tower, Augu&s;t 22, 1722; but was never brought to trial, which he repeatedly de&s;ired. At length a bill was brought into parliament, and pa&s;&s;ed, by which he was &s;entenced to deprivation and bani&s;hment, and which received the royal a&s;&s;ent May 27, 1723. It is &s;aid the king gave his a&s;&s;ent to the bill with regret. None of his relations, not even his own children, were permitted to vi&s;it him in his bani&s;h+ment, without fir&s;t obtaining leave under the king's &s;ign manual. On the 18th of June he left this kingdom; and died at Paris, Feb. 17, 1731-2. His body was brought to England, and interred on the 12th of May following in We&s;tmin&s;ter Abbey. His bowels were in an urn, thus in|&s;cribed,
<Q><L>"In h&acirc;c urn&acirc; depo&s;iti &s;unt cineres</L>
<L>Franci&s;ci Atterbury, Epi&s;copi Roffenfis."</L></Q>
Mr. Pope's very beautiful epitaph on him is printed in the Engli&s;h Poets, vol. XXXIII. p. 364. and the following inedited in&s;cription has lately been communicated to me:

Dr. Atterbury and Dr. Smalridge married two &s;i&s;ters, the daughters of the Rev. Mr. O&s;borne, a relation to the duke of Leeds, who had a benefice in the neighbour|hood of Oxford, and taught the French language to the young gentlemen at the univer&s;ity. By his lady Dr. At|terbury had i&s;&s;ue one &s;on, O&s;borne Atterbury, and two daughters. The &s;on, who was educated at Chri&s;t Church in Oxford, went to The Ea&s;t Indies, whence he returned in 1732, and &s;ucceeded to the e&s;tate of his uncle, Dr. Lewis Atterbury, at Great Houghton in Northampton&s;hire, then worth about 400l. a year. After &s;ome time, he was ordained by his father's great rival, Bi&s;hop Hoadly; and obtained the living of O$hill in Warwick&s;hire, in June 1746. A letter from the Bi&s;hop to this &s;on will appear in his Epi&s;tolary Corre&s;pondence. One of the Bi&s;hop's daugh|ters died &s;ingle; the other, his favourite, was married to William Morice, E&s;q. the high-bailiff of We&s;tmin&s;ter. I hope &s;peedily to lay before the publick &s;ome farther particulars of this truly elegant Writer, with two volumes of his Epi&s;|tolary Corre&s;pondence.</NOTE>; WRITTEN ON A WHITE FAN BORROWED FROM MISS OSBORNE, AFTERWARDS HIS WIFE.</HEAD>

<HEAD>SONG, TAKEN FROM BP. ATTERBURY'S OWN HAND-WRITING<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">On the &s;ame authority I a&s;cribe the elegant little &s;ong in vol. III. p. 191. to this accompli&s;hed Prelate; and al&s;o the Imitation of Theocritus, which is printed anonymou&s;ly vol. I. p. 99. under the title of "The Honey Stealer." In the Bi&s;hop's copy it is called "The Bee;" and the four fir&s;t lines are here copied, as containing &s;ome &s;light variations:

<BYLINE>IMITATED BY DR. ATTERBURY <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">"Any one who hath a genius for poetry, &s;ays a learned corre&s;pondent, will agree with me in wi&s;hing that Atterbury had never had any other occupation but poetry. His &s;ame as a politician or a divine is not equal to what he de&s;erves for this tran&s;lation, which is, without exception, the be&s;t in any lan|guage that I have met with." This, undoubtedly, is carrying the encomium on Dr. Atterbury's poetical talent very far; and yet we can &s;carcely venture to &s;ay that it is carried too far. There is &s;omething &s;o exceedingly beautiful in the &s;pecimens which are given of his early turn for poetry, that it is greatly to be regretted that he did not more direct his thoughts that way. The tran&s;lation of this Ode is in the highe&s;t degree beautiful. The Ode it&s;elf, in the original, is peculiarly ex|cellent and delightful; and Dr. Atterbury hath mo&s;t happily &s;ucceeded in clothing it in an Engli&s;h dre&s;s. It was judicious in Dr. Francis not to attempt a new ver&s;ion of this Ode, after &s;o admirable a one was furni&s;hed to his hands. And he ju&s;tly ob&s;erves, that by Bi&s;hop Atterbury's &s;ucce&s;s we may be con|vinced that it is not impo&s;&s;ible to render Horace into Engli&s;h without any great lo&s;s of his original beauties."

<HEAD>SOLILOQUY OF CATO <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Foreign nations have done this tragedy as much honour as our own; and indeed it is one of tho&s;e few performances which cannot receive more honour than it de&s;erves. It was tran&s;lated more than once into French, obtained two Italian ver&s;ions, and has been either tran&s;lated or imitated in the German language. But the greate&s;t honour that was ever done to it, was the putting the Soliloquy of Cato, which is perhaps the noble&s;t thing in our language, into a Latin dre&s;s, which might have been read with admiration, even by the criticks in the court of Augu&s;tus.

<HEAD>MENALCAS AND ENOSIA, A PASTORAL DIALOGUE.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY THE DUKE OF WHARTON <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This unprincipled and unthinking genius, only &s;on of the marquis of Wharton by Lucy his &s;econd lady, was born in December 1698, and educated under the immediate in&s;pection of his father, who anxiou&s;ly endeavoured to qua|lify him for the high &s;tation his birth gave him rea&s;on to expect. The fir&s;t &s;ource of his unhappine&s;s was a precipitate marriage with the daughter of major general Holmes, an amiable lady, but &s;o infinitely his inferior in rank and fortune that their union ha&s;tened the marquis's death, which hap|pened April 12, 1715, when the young lord had little more than entered into his 17th year. Early in 1716 he indulged his de&s;ire of travelling, and vi&s;ited &s;everal courts of Germany, particularly that of Hanover. When at Lyons, he pre&s;ented a very fine hor&s;e to the chevalier de St. George, who in|vited him to Avignon, and flattered him with the vi&s;ionary title of Duke of Northumberland. Continuing there but one day, he made a vi&s;it at St. Germains to the dowager of king James the Second. A friend expo&s;tulating with him on this conduct, he an&s;wered, "that he had pawned his principles to Gordon, the Pretender's banker, for a con&s;iderable &s;um; and till he could repay him, he mu&s;t be a Jacobite; but when that was done, he would again return to the Whigs." He came back to England in December 1716; and &s;oon &s;et out for Ireland, where, on account of his extraordinary qualities, he was admitted, though under age, to take his &s;eat in the hou&s;e of peers; where, having di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf as a violent partizan for the mini&s;try, he was taken notice of by king George I. who created him a duke, Jan. 20, 1717. When he came of age, he was introduced into the hou&s;e of lords in England with the greate&s;t blaze of reputation; but &s;oon changed &s;ides again, and heartily oppo&s;ed the court. His &s;peech again&s;t the mini&s;try, Feb. 4, 1720-21, had a fatal effect; earl Stanhope an&s;wering it with &s;o much warmth that he bur&s;t a blood-ve&s;&s;el and died. He was one of the mo&s;t forward in defence of Bp. Atterbury in 1723; and profe&s;&s;edly commenced author, by publi&s;hing his thoughts twice a week in a paper called "The True Briton." His boundle&s;s profu&s;ion had in the mean time &s;o incumbered his e&s;tate that he re&s;olved to go abroad in order to clear it. He vi&s;ited Vienna and Madrid; and, after &s;hewing by his con|duct at both the&s;e courts his di&s;like to the illu&s;trious family on the Briti&s;h throne, entered openly into the &s;ervice of the Pretender. Whil&s;t thus employed abroad, his dutche&s;s, who had been neglected by him, died in England, April 14, 1726, without i&s;&s;ue; and he &s;oon after married Madam Oberne, one of the maids of honour to the queen of Spain. After this marriage, he pa&s;&s;ed &s;ome time at Rome, under the title of Duke of Northumberland, and accepted a blue rib|band from the Pretender, who&s;e confidence he enjoyed as long as his natural volubility would permit. To prevent his falling into actual di&s;grace, he quitted Rome, and offered him&s;elf to the King of Spain as a volunteer at the &s;iege of Gibraltar. His &s;ervices were accepted: but he &s;oon grew weary, and wi&s;hed to return again to the court of the Cheva|lier; who found means to di&s;&s;uade him from this intention. He took up his re&s;idence at Rouen in May, 1728; about which time a bill of indictment was preferred again&s;t him in England for high trea&s;on. The Chevalier &s;upplied him with 2000l. for his &s;upport; which was &s;oon very profu&s;ely &s;quan|dered away. After this period he removed to Orleans, to Nantz, and to Bilboa. In the beginning of 1731, the Duke declined &s;o fa&s;t, being in his quarters at Lerida, that he had not the u&s;e of his limbs &s;o as to move without a&s;&s;i&s;tance. He received &s;ome benefit from mineral waters; but relap&s;ed in May at Terragona, and fell into one of the fainting fits to which he had been for &s;ome time &s;ubject, at a &s;mall village, and was utterly de&s;titute of the nece&s;&s;aries of life, till &s;ome chari|table fathers of a Bernardine convent offered him the a&s;&s;i&s;tance their hou&s;e afforded. The duke accepted the propo&s;al; was removed to their convent; and under their ho&s;pitable roof, after langui&s;hing a week, died without one friend or acquain|tance to clo&s;e his eyes. He was buried in the &s;ame manner in which the fathers inter tho&s;e of their own fraternity. His character, which was admirably drawn by Mr. Pope, in one of his Moral E&s;&s;ays (Epi&s;tle I. ver. 180.) is thus elegantly enlarged on by an ingenious writer who had every opportunity of being well-informed:
<Q>&startq;Like Buck|ingham and Roche&s;ter he comforted all the grave and dull by throwing away the brighte&s;t profu&s;ion of parts on witty fooleries, debaucheries, and &s;crapes, which may mix graces with a great character, but never can compo&s;e one. If Julius Cae&s;ar had only <HI>rioted</HI> with Catiline, he had never been Emperor of the World. Indeed the Duke of Wharton was not made for conque&s;t: he was not equally formed for a Roundhou&s;e and Phar&s;alia. In one of his ballads he has bantered his own want of heroi&s;m; it was in a &s;ong he made on being &s;eized by the guard in St. James's Park, for &s;inging the Jacobite air, <HI>The King &s;hall have [enjoy] his own again</HI>,
<Q><L>"The Duke he drew out half his &s;word,</L>
<L>&mdash;The Guard drew out the re&s;t.</L></Q>
His levities, wit, and want of principles, his eloquence, and adventures, are too well known to be recapitulated. With attachment to no party, though with talents to govern any party, this lively man changed the free air of We&s;tmin&s;ter for the gloom of the E&s;curial, the pro&s;pect of King George's Garter for the Pretender's; and, with indifference to all religion, the frolic Lord, who had writ the ballad on the Archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, died in the hand of a Ca|puchin. It is difficult to give an account of the works of &s;o mercurial a man, who&s;e library was a tavern, and women of plea&s;ure his Mu&s;es. A thou&s;and &s;allies of his imagi|nation have been lo&s;t; he no more wrote for fame than he acted for it.&endq;</Q>
Noble Authors, vol. II. p. 130.&mdash;My intention was to have printed all the duke of Wharton's poe|tical productions in this volume; but having been informed, whil&s;t this &s;heet was actually in the pre&s;s, that a complete collection of them was preparing by an ingenious gentleman who has been long collecting materials expre&s;sly for that purpo&s;e, I readily relinqui&s;h my fir&s;t de&s;ign; and &s;ubmit two only of this nobleman's poems to the publick, as a &s;pe|cimen of his uncommon talents.

<HEAD>THE SALISBURY BALLAD <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This Poem was given me in MS. by my worthy friend Anthony Henley, e&s;&abque; who u&s;ed to call it his favourite, for the humour and &s;implicity of it, and its delicate ra$llery on the Dutch commentators. I think, indeed, his judgement was as right in that, as it was in every thing el&s;e relating to poetry and critici&s;m. This ballad was written by the famous Dr. Walter Pope, author of the Old Man's Wi&s;h, who lived with Dr. Ward, then bi&s;hop of Sa$&s;bury, and had a pen&s;ion from him of 100l. a year. Mr. H$nley told me, there was but one copy of it taken from hi$ MS. and it never was made public till now. PEMBERTON.</NOTE>.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY DR. WALTER POPE <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Of Dr. Pope, &s;ome account has been already given, vol. I. p. 170. This ballad, it is &s;aid in the Athenae, was a &s;a|$e on the bi&s;hop of Sali&s;bury for depriving the Doctor of his mi&s;tre&s;s, which cau&s;ed a difference between them for a time. See Ward's Gre&s;ham Profe&s;&s;ors, p. 115. Lord chan|cellor Cowper's opinion of it is thus given in a letter to Mr. Hughes: "I mu&s;t confe&s;s, I ta&s;te Dr. Pope's ballad, as my acquaintance Mr. Henley did."

<HEAD>NEREIDES: OR, SEA-ECLOGUES.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY MR. JOHN DIAPER <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Of the life of this ingenious poet, but few particulars are known. He was bred at Baliol College, Oxford; and by publi&s;hing the Eclogues here re-printed obtained the pa|tronage of Swift, who thus de&s;cribes the author and his poem: "Here is a young fellow has writ &s;ome &s;ea-eclogues, poems of mermen, re&s;embling pa&s;torals of &s;hepherds; and they are very pretty, and the thought is new. Mermen are he|mermaids Tritons, natives of the &s;ea. &mdash; His name is Diaper. I mu&s;t do &s;omething for him, and get him out of the way. I hate to have any new wits ri&s;e; yet when they do ri&s;e, I would encourage them; but they tread on our heels, and thru&s;t us off the &s;tage." Journal to Stella, March 12, 1711-12. "The author of the Sea-Eclogues &s;ent books to the Society ye&s;terday, and we gave him guineas apiece; and may do fur|ther for him." Ib. March 21. On the 23d of December Mr. Diaper pre&s;ented to Lord Bolingbroke a new philo&s;ophical po|em, "The Dryades, or the Nymph's Prophecy," (re-printed in Poetical Calendar, vol. IX. p. 17.) "which, &s;ays Swift, is a very good one; and I am to give him a &s;um of money from my Lord: and I have contrived to make a Par&s;on of him, for he is half one already, being in Deacon's orders, and &s;erves a &s;mall cure in the country; but has a &s;word at his tail here in town. It is a poor little &s;hort wretch, but will do be&s;t in a gown, and we will make Lord Keeper give him a living." Two months after this, Swift kindly vi&s;ited him "in a na&s;ty gar|ret, very &s;ick; and gave him twenty guineas from Lord Bo|lingbroke." Unfortunately for the poor poet, his friends lo&s;t their power before they had an opportunity of providing for him; and he died a country curate, in 1717, in the 29th year of his age. Be&s;ides the "Nereides" and "Dryades," he pub|li&s;hed an imitation of an Ode of Horace, which is printed in the Supplement to Swift; a&s;&s;i&s;ted Mr. Rowe in the tran&s;la|tion of Quillet's "Callipaedia," of which the fir&s;t half of Book IV. is by Mr. Diaper; and left behind him in MS. a tran&s;lation of the three fir&s;t books of Oppian's Halicutics, which were printed by &s;ub&s;cription, in 8vo. 1722, with the re|mainder of the work executed by Mr. Jones, who was like|wi&s;e of Baliol College.

Of this kind was the Girl kept at Harleim, who was &s;o far rational as to be taught to &s;pin, to under&s;tand tho&s;e about her, and to expre&s;s her devotions at prayers. We have an account in our Engli&s;h Chronicles of a Sea-inhabitant taken entirely human. Nay, if we believe Hi&s;tory, the Sea has, as Du Bar|tas expre&s;&s;es it, the Mitred Bi&s;hop, and the Cowled Fryar. Alexander ab Alexandro, after &s;everal other &s;tories of the like nature, gives us the following relation, which, becau&s;e it carries with it an air of truth, and is &s;omewhat agreeable, I &s;hall tran&s;late at length. "Theodorus Gaza, &s;ays he, a learn|ed Greek, living in the Peloponne&s;us, &s;aw a Nereid, with &s;hoals of other fi&s;h, driven to &s;hore by the violence of a &s;ud|d$n &s;torm: her face was perfectly human, and not di&s;agreea|ble; her body &s;caly, and from the middle downward &s;he &s;eems to have been not unlike our common Sign-po&s;t Mermaids. The people flocked together to &s;ee this &s;trange mon&s;ter; who, when &s;he perceived there was no po&s;&s;ibility of e&s;caping, &s;hew|ed all the marks of &s;orrow and di&s;tre&s;s. But, when the water had quite left her, and &s;he &s;aw her&s;elf expo&s;ed as an object of wonder to the multitude, &s;he fetched the deepe&s;t &s;ighs that grief could expre&s;s, and bur&s;t out at length into a flood of tears. Gaza, who was a man naturally tender and compa&s;&s;io|nate, took pity on this di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Lady, and per&s;uaded the people to &s;uffer her to return to her native element." The &s;ame Author tells us, that Georgius Trapezuntius (another famous modern Greek) affirmed "That he &s;aw, as he was walking on the &s;hore, a hand&s;ome Girl from the wa&s;te up|wards, who, by her often diving, &s;eemed &s;porting her&s;elf in the water; and when &s;he perceived &s;he was di&s;covered, im|mediately di&s;appeared." However it be, the antient Nymphs and Nereids, and the modern Mermaids, are &s;ufficient grounds to free the &s;uppo&s;ition from ab&s;urdity, or extravagance: and &s;ince we have gone &s;o far as to have found inhabitants in the Planets, I hope I &s;hall not be condemned for having di&s;cover|ed the manners and conver&s;ation of a people nearer home: be|&s;ides we know, that the agreeable images, which are drawn from things on Earth, bave been long &s;ince exhau&s;ted; but it will be allowed, that the beauties (as well as the riches) of the Sea are yet in a great mea&s;ure untouched: and tho&s;e who have made attempts that way, have only given us a few Pi&s;|catory Eclogues, like the fir&s;t coa&s;ters, that always keep within &s;ight of &s;hore, and never venture into the ocean. Lu|cian indeed has &s;omething of this nature; but, as his de&s;ign was chiefly to expo&s;e the Heathen Deities, &s;o it mu&s;t be owned that the be&s;t of our modern productions are owing to tho&s;e hints, which were taken from that great Wit.

<BYLINE>BY HER HUSBAND, [MR. BIRCH <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><P>This valuable hi&s;torical and biographical writer was born in the pari&s;h of St. John, Clerkenwell, on the 23d of November, 1705. His parents were both of them Quakers; $nd his father, Jo&s;eph Birch, was a coffee mill-maker by $rade. Mr. Jo&s;eph Birch endeavoured to bring up his &s;on to his own bu&s;ine&s;s; but &s;o ardent was the youth's pa&s;&s;ion for reading, that he &s;olicited his father to be indulged in this i$clination, promi&s;ing, in that ca&s;e, to provide for him&s;elf. The fir&s;t &s;chool he went to was at Hemel-Hem&s;ted in Hert|ford&s;hire. It was kept by John Owen, a rigid Quaker, for whom Mr. Birch afterwards officiated &s;ome little while as an u&s;her. The next &s;chool was kept by one Welby, near Turnmill-&s;treet, Clerkenwell, who never had above eight or ten &s;cholars at a time, whom he profe&s;&s;ed to in&s;truct in the Latin tongue in a year and a half. To him Mr. Birch was, likewi&s;e, an u&s;her; $s he al&s;o afterwards was to Mr. Be&s;&s;e, the famous Quaker, in George's Court in St. John's Lane, who publi&s;hed the po&s;thu|mous works of Claridge. It is farther &s;aid that he went to Ireland with Dean Smedley; but in what year, and how long he re&s;ided with the Dean, cannot now be a&s;certained. Smedley publi&s;hed in 1728 "A Specimen of an univer&s;al View of all the Eminent Writers on the Holy Scriptures; being a Collection of the di&s;&s;ertations, explications, and opi|nions of learned men, in all ages, concerning the difficult pa&s;|&s;ages and ob&s;cure texts of the Bible; and of what&s;oever is to be met with, in profane authors, which may contribute to|wards the better under&s;tanding of them." This exten&s;ive undertaking was intended to have been compri&s;ed in two large folio volumes: had the plan proceeded, it is no very far-fetched conjecture to &s;uppo&s;e that Mr. Birch was to have been an a&s;&s;i&s;tant. He was indefatigable in his application, and &s;tole many hours from &s;leep to increa&s;e his &s;tock of know|ledge. By this unremitting diligence, though he had not the happine&s;s of an univer&s;ity education, he &s;oon became qua|lified to take holy orders in the church of England, to the &s;urprize of his acquaintance. It is not preci&s;ely known when this event took place; but it mu&s;t have been as early as 1728. In the &s;ame year he married the daughter of the Rev. Mr. Cox, to whom he was curate; and in this union he was &s;in|gularly happy: but his felicity was of &s;hort duration, Mrs. Birch dying in le&s;s than twelve months after their marriage. The di&s;order which carried her off was a puerperal fever, and almo&s;t in the very article of her death &s;he wrote to her hu&s;|band the following letter:
<LETTER>
<OPENER><DATE>"July 31, 1729.</DATE></OPENER>

</LETTER></P>
<P>In 1732 he was recommended to the friend&s;hip and favour of the late Lord High Chancellor Hardwicke, then Attorney General; to which noble Peer, and to the pre&s;ent Earl of Hardwicke, he was indebted for all his preferments. The fir&s;t proof he experienced of his patron's regard, was the liv|ing of Ulting, in the county of E&s;&s;ex, in the gift of the crown, to which he was pre&s;ented 1732. In 1734, he was appointed one of the dome&s;tic chaplains to the unfortunate Earl of Kilmarnock, who was beheaded 1746. Mr. Birch was cho&s;en a member of the Royal Society, Feb. 20, 1734-5; and of the Society of Antiquaries, Dec. 11, 1735, of which he afterwards became Director till the year 1746. Before this the Mari&s;chal College of Aberdeen had conferred on him, by diploma, the degree of Ma&s;ter of Arts. In 1743, by the intere&s;t of Lord Hardwicke, he was pre&s;ented by the crown to the &s;inecure rectory of Landewy Welfrey in the country of Pembroke; and in 1743-4 was preferred, in the &s;ame man|ner, to the rectory of Siddington St. Peter's, in the county and dioce&s;e of Glouce&s;ter. We find no traces of his having taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of this living; and, indeed, it is probable that he quitted it immediately, for one more &s;uitable to his incli|nations, and to his literary engagements, which required his almo&s;t con&s;tant re&s;idence in town; for on the 24th of Febru|ary, 1743-4, he was in&s;tituted to the united rectories of St. Michael, Wood-&s;treet, and St. Mary Staining; and in 1745-6 to the united rectories of St. Margaret Pattens, and St. Gabriel, Fenchurch-&s;treet (by Lord Chancellor Hard|wicke, in who&s;e turn the pre&s;entation then was). In Janu|ary, 1752, he was elected one of the Secretaries of the Royal Society, in the room of Dr. Cromwell Mortimer, decea&s;ed. In January, 1753, the Mari&s;chal College of Aberdeen created him Doctor of Divinity; and in that year the &s;ame degree was conferred on him by archbi&s;hop Herring. He was one of the tru&s;tees of The Briti&s;h Mu&s;eum, for which honour he was probably indebted to the pre&s;ent Earl of Hardwicke; as he was for his la&s;t preferment, the rectory of Depden in E&s;&s;ex, to which he was inducted Feb. 26, 1761. In the lat|ter part of his life he was chaplain to the Prince&s;s Amelia. In 1765 he re&s;igned his office of Secretary to the Royal So|ciety. His health declining about this time, he was ordered to ride for the recovery of it; but being a bad hor&s;eman, and going out, Jan. 9, 1766, he was unfortunately thrown from his hor&s;e on the road betwixt London and Hamp&s;tead, and died on the &s;pot, in the 61&s;t year of his age, to the great re|gret of the Doctor's numerous literary friends; and was bu|ried in St Margaret Pattens. A li&s;t of his valuable publica|tions may be &s;een in the new edition of the "Biographia Bri|tannica." N.</P></NOTE>.] WRITTEN ON HER COFFIN.</BYLINE>

<HEAD>A LOYAL EXHORTATION, 1688.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY LORD LANSDOWNE <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">If the te&s;timonies of contemporary writers were to be relied on, this Nobleman would be intitled to the highe&s;t rank, as an accompli&s;hed gentleman, an exalted genius, and an excellent poet. Waller, Dryden, Addi&s;on, Pope, Boling|broke, and Young, have borne evidence in the mo&s;t ample manner to his abilities. He was a younger &s;on of a younger mother, nearly related to the family of the earl of Bath; was born in 1667; became a member of Trinity College, Cambridge, at a very early period of life; took his degree of M. A. there at the age of 13 years; and was with diffi|culty prevented from taking-up arms, both at the time of Monmouth's rebellion, and at the Revolution of King James. Having no public employment, being totally unconnected with the court, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of but a contracted fortune, he devoted his attention during the reign of King William to literary pur&s;uits and amu&s;ements, the fruits of which appear|ed in his plays and poems, chiefly written within that period. At the acce&s;&s;ion of Queen Anne, he was cho&s;en into parlia|ment, and &s;ate in the hou&s;e of commons until he was created a peer. On the change of the mini&s;try, in the year 1710, he was appointed &s;ecretary at war, and afterwards &s;ucce&s;&s;ively comptroller and trea&s;urer of the hou&s;ehold. His connections with the Tory mini&s;ters prevented his being employed in the &s;ucceeding reigns of George I. and II. in the former of which he fell under &s;u&s;picion of plotting again&s;t the Government, and was committed to the Tower, where he was confined 17 months. The latter part of his life was &s;pent in the cultivation of letters in an honourable retirement, univer|&s;ally beloved and re&s;pected by all orders of men. He died January 30, 1735, in the 68th year of his age. Mr. Walpole ob&s;erves, that "he imitated Waller; but, as that poet has been much excelled &s;ince, a faint copy of a &s;aint ma&s;ter mu&s;t &s;trike le&s;s."&mdash; I owe the&s;e ob&s;ervations (and all the notes in this Collection &s;igned R). to the friend&s;hip of the gentleman who collected the pieces which form the Sixth Volume of Dr. Young's Works.

Being &s;o great an heire&s;s, &s;he was thrice mar|ried, and twice a widow before &s;he was &s;ixteen.

She was &s;econdly married, or contracted, to Thomas Thynne e&s;&abque; of Longleate, who was a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated on Sunday Feb. 12, 1681-2, as he was riding through Pall Mall in his coach by &s;ome ru&s;&s;ians hired by Count Coning&s;marck, who had entertained pre&s;umptuous hopes of &s;ucceeding with this young heire&s;s, if he could remove Mr. Thynne out of the way; but in this he was mi&s;taken, for though he him&s;elf e&s;caped the puni&s;h|ment due for this horrible crime, he reaped no advantage from it; as, May 30, 1682, &s;he was thirdly married to Charles Seymour duke of Somer&s;et, being then only in her &s;ixteenth year.

The poor creature was with child. She was my greate&s;t favourite, and I am in exce&s;&s;ive concern for her lo&s;s. I hardly knew a more valuable per&s;on on all accounts.

<HEAD>SONG FOR ST. CECILIA'S DAY<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See vol. IV. p. 28.64.357.&mdash;This &s;ong of Shadwell's, is &s;elected as a &s;pecimen of his poetry, will &s;erve to complete the &s;eries of ver&s;es in honour of St. Cecilia. N.</NOTE>. WRITTEN BY THO. SHADWELL <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Thomas Shadwell e&s;&abque; (of a good family in Stafford|&s;hire) born at his father's &s;eat at Stanton Hall in Nor|folk about 1640, was educated at Caius College, Cambridge; and, after &s;tudying the law for &s;ome time in The Middle Temple, went abroad. On his return, he &s;oon introduced him&s;elf by his dramatic writings to per&s;ons of the fir&s;t con|&s;equence; and obtained on the Revolution the office of Poet Laureat. "The revenue, &s;ays Dr. John&s;on, which Dryden had enjoyed with &s;o much prai&s;e, was transferred to Shadwell, an old enemy, whom he had formerly &s;tigmatized by the name of <HI>Og.</HI> Dryden could not decently complain that he was depo&s;ed; but &s;eemed very angry that Shadwell &s;ucceeded him, and has therefore celebrated the intruder's inauguration in a poem exqui&s;itely &s;atirical, called <HI>Mac Flecno</HI>." It has been well ob&s;erved by another able writer, "that a &s;atiri&s;t never pays the lea&s;t regard to truth, when it interferes with the gratification of his re&s;entment or &s;pleen." Nothing can be fal&s;er than the idea intended to be conveyed in the follow|ing couplet:
<Q><L>"Others to &s;ome faint meaning make pretence,</L>
<L>But Shadwell never deviates into &s;en&s;e."</L></Q>
Mr. Shadwell was far inferior to Dryden; but Shadwell did not write non&s;en&s;e. Many of his comedies have fine &s;trokes of humour, and abound in original characters &s;trongly marked and well &s;u&s;tained. He had an uncommon quic$|ne&s;s of writing. The earl of Roche&s;ter, who has ob&s;erved that
<Q><L>"None &s;eem to touch upon true comedy</L>
<L>But ha&s;ty Shadwell, and &s;low Wicherley,"</L></Q>
had &s;till a better opinion of his conver&s;at$on than of his writ|ings; for he &s;aid, "that if he had burnt all he wrote, and printed all he &s;poke, he would have had more wit and humour than any other poet." He was a great favourite with Otway; who &s;hared with him in the contempt of Dryden. He died Dec. 9, 1692: and a white marble monument, with his bu&s;t, was placed in We&s;tmin&s;ter Abbey by his &s;on Sir John Shad|well, phy&s;ician to king George II. He wrote 17 plays, which need not be here enumerated; and was author of &s;everal &s;mall poems; the chief of which are, 1. the Ode here printed; 2. A congratulatory poem on the Prince of Orange's coming to England; 3. another on Queen Mary; and 4. a tran&s;lation of the tenth &s;atire of Juvenal. N.</NOTE>, ESQ. 1690.</HEAD>

<HEAD>ODE ON ST. CECILIA'S DAY,</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY MR. BRADY <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Son of Major Nicholas Brady (an officer of the king's army in the rebellion of 1641,) and of Martha daughter of Luke Gernon (a judge of &s;ingular meekne&s;s and probity). He was born at Bandon in the county of Cork, Oct. 28, 1659, and educated at St. Finberry's, in that county, under Dr. Tindall, till he was twelve years of age, when he wa$ removed to We&s;tmin&s;ter &s;chool, where he was cho&s;en king's &s;cholar, and thence elected &s;tudent of Chri&s;t Church, Ox|ford. Dr. Bu&s;by had always a particular regard for him; and at both tho&s;e elections he was fir&s;t and captain among all the candidates: after continuing at Oxford about four years, he went to Dublin, where his father re&s;ided; at which uni|ver&s;ity he immediately commenced B. A. and the following year M. A. When of due &s;tanding, the diploma for the degree of D. D. was, upon account of his uncommon merit, pre&s;ented to him from that univer&s;ity while he was in Eng|land, and brought over by Dr. Pratt, then &s;enior travelling-fellow, and afterwards provo&s;t of that college. His fir&s;t pre|ferment in the church was to a prebend, in the cathedral of St. Bury's, in the city of Cork, and to the pari&s;h of Kina|glarchy, in the county of Cork; to which he was collated by Bp. Wettenhall, to whom he was dome&s;tic chaplain. He was a zealous promoter of the Revolution, and an eminent &s;ufferer for it. In 1690, when the troubles broke out in Ireland, by his intere&s;t with General Mac Carty, he thrice prevented the burning of Bandon town, after three &s;everal orders from king James to de&s;troy it. The &s;ame year, hav|ing been deputed by the people of Bandon, he went over to England, to petition the parliament for a redre&s;s of &s;ome grievances they had &s;uffered. During his &s;tay there, and to the time of his death, he was in the highe&s;t e&s;teem among all ranks of per&s;ons in that kingdom, for his eminent at|tachment to the true intere&s;t of his country. June 29, 1690, he married Laetitia daughter of Dr. Synge, archdeacon of Cork, and a near relation of the bi&s;hop of that name. By this lady he had four &s;ons and four daughters. Having quitted his preferments in Ireland, he &s;ettled in London, where he became noted for his abilities in the pulpit, and was elected mini&s;ter of St. Catharine Creechurch, in 1691, and lecturer of St. Michael, Wood-&s;treet. He &s;oon after, in conjunction with Mr. Tate, undertook a new ver&s;ion of the P&s;alms, which have &s;ince (though Brady's &s;hare of it incurred the ridicule of Swift in his "Remarks on Gibbs,") been adopted in a con&s;iderable number of our pari&s;h churches. Whil&s;t he was engaged in this undertaking, he retired to Richmond in Surrey; and, in con&s;equence of the high e&s;|teem entertained for him by the gentlemen of that village, was invited to accept the office of their mini&s;ter. The vi|carage of Stratford upon Avon was pre&s;ented to him by the great earl of Dor&s;et; and the rectory of Clapham in Surrey by Dame Rebekah Atkins, relict of Sir Richard Atkins, bart. This rectory he held, with Richmond, till his death. He was al&s;o chaplain to the duke of Ormond's troop of hor&s;e-guards, as he was to king William and queen Mary, and afterwards to queen Anne. The whole of his prefer|ments, which were in very plea&s;ant and elegible &s;ituations, amounted to &s;ix hundred pounds a-year. His qualifications, it is &s;aid, would have rai&s;ed him to &s;ome of the greate&s;t dig|nities in the church, if the &s;ingular humanity and benevo|lence of his di&s;po&s;ition would have &s;uffered him to have run in with the vehemence of either prevailing party, or had he not &s;ettled in a country where he was regarded as a foreigner. Dr. Brady wrote a Play, called
<Q>&startq;The Rape, or The Innocent Impo&s;tors, a Tragedy, acted at Drury Lane, 1692,&endq;</Q>
and publi&s;hed in 4to, in that year, with his name. He died March 20, 1726, in the 67th year of his age, leaving behind him the character of being a per&s;on of a mo&s;t obliging, &s;weet, affable temper, a polite gentleman, an excellent preacher, and a good poet. His publications are, 1. The ver&s;ion of the P&s;alms; 2. The Aeneids of Virgil, publi&s;hed by &s;ub&s;cription, 2 vols. 8vo. the la&s;t of them in 1726. He al&s;o publi&s;hed, in his life time, two volumes of Sermons, printed at London in 1704 and 1706; to which a third (po&s;thumous) volume was added in 1730. N.</NOTE>, 1692.</BYLINE>

<BYLINE>AS ALTERED BY MR. POPE <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Set to mu&s;ic by Dr. Greene, in 1730, as an exerci&s;e on taking his degree of Doctor of Mu&s;ic in the univer&s;ity of Cambridge. It was performed with great applau&s;e; and, as an additional te&s;timony to his merit, Dr. Greene was honoured with the title of profe&s;&s;or of mu&s;ic at Cambridge. To an&s;wer Greene's purpo&s;e, Mr. Pope conde&s;cended to make con&s;iderable alterations in the poem, and at his reque&s;t to in&s;ert in it one &s;tanza, viz. the third. As he thereby rendered it greatly diffe|rent from the ode originally publi&s;hed, I &s;hall make no apo|logy to my readers for copying it from the valuable work in which it fir&s;t appeared in print, the "Hi&s;tory of Mu&s;ic," by Sir John Hawkins. See vol. V. of that excellent perform|ance, p. 328. And &s;ee al&s;o Mr. Go&s;tling's Catalogue of Mu&s;ic, &s;old by auction by S. Baker in May 1777. N.</NOTE>.</BYLINE>
