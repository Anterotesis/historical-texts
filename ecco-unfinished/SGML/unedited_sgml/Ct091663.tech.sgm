<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="letter">
<HEAD>LETTER I.</HEAD>
<P>I ARRIVED at Paris, by a very ra|pid
journey, the day before the fede|ration;
and when I am di&s;po&s;ed to mur|mur
at the evils of my de&s;tiny, I &s;hall
henceforth put this piece of good fortune
into the oppo&s;ite &s;cale, and reflect how
many di&s;appointments it ought to coun|terbalance.
Had the packet which con|veyed
me from Brighton to Dieppe &s;ailed
a few hours later; had the wind been con|trary;
in &s;hort, had I not reached Paris
at the moment I did reach it, I &s;hould
<PB N="2" REF="4">
have mi&s;&s;ed the mo&s;t &s;ublime &s;pectacle
which, perhaps, was ever repre&s;ented on
the theatre of this earth.</P>
<P>I &s;hall &s;end you once a week the de|tails
which I promi&s;ed when we parted,
though I am well aware how very im|perfectly
I &s;hall be able to de&s;cribe the
images which pre&s;s upon my mind. It
is much ea&s;ier to feel what is &s;ublime than
to paint it; and all I &s;hall be able to
give you will be a faint &s;ketch, to which
your own imagination mu&s;t add colour|ing
and &s;pirit. The night before the fe|deration,
by way of prelude to the &s;olem|nities
of that memorable day, the Te
Deum was performed at the church of
Notre Dame, by a greater number of
mu&s;icians than have ever been a&s;&s;embled
together, excepting at We&s;tmin&s;ter Ab|bey.
The overture which preceded the
Te Deum was &s;imple and maje&s;tic: the
mu&s;ic, highly expre&s;&s;ive, had the power
of electrifying the hearers: and near the
<PB N="3" REF="5">
conclu&s;ion of the piece, the compo&s;er, by
artful di&s;cords, produced a melancholy
emotion, and then, by exciting ideas of
trouble and inquietude, prepared the mind
for a recitative which affected the audi|ence
in a very powerful manner, by re|calling
the images of that con&s;ternation
and horror which prevailed in Paris on
the 13th of July, 1789, the day before
that on which the Ba&s;tille was taken.
The words were, as well as I can recol|lect,
what follows:&mdash;&startq;People, your ene|mies
advance, with ho&s;tile &s;entiments,
with menacing looks! They come to bathe
their hands in your blood! Already they
encompa&s;s the walls of your city! Ri&s;e,
ri&s;e from the inaction in which you are
plunged, &s;eize your arms, and fly to the
combat! God will combat with you!&endq;
The&s;e words were &s;ucceeded by a chorus
of in&s;truments and voices, deep and &s;o|lemn,
which &s;eemed to chill the &s;oul. But
what completed the effect was, when the
<PB N="4" REF="6">
&s;ound of a loud and heavy bell mixed
it&s;elf with this awful concert, in imitation
of the alarm-bell, which, the day before
the taking of the Ba&s;tille, was rung in every
church and convent in Paris, and which,
it is &s;aid, produced a confu&s;ion of &s;ounds
inexpre&s;&s;ibly horrible. At this moment
the audience appeared to breathe with
difficulty; every heart &s;eemed frozen with
terror; till at length the bell cea&s;ed, the
mu&s;ic changed its tone, and another re|citative
announced the entire defeat of
the enemy; and the whole terminated,
after a flouri&s;h of drums and trumpets,
with an hymn of thank&s;giving to the Su|preme
Being.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER II.</HEAD>
<P>I Promi&s;ed to &s;end you a de&s;cription of
the federation: but it is not to be de|&s;cribed!
One mu&s;t have been pre&s;ent, to
form any judgment of a &s;cene, the &s;ubli|mity
of which depended much le&s;s on its
external magnificence than on the effect
it produced on the minds of the &s;pecta|tors.
&startq;The people, &s;ure, the people
were the &s;ight!&endq; I may tell you of pa|vilions,
of triumphal arches, of altars on
which incen&s;e was burnt, of two hundred
thou&s;and men walking in proce&s;&s;ion; but
how am I to give you an adequate idea
of the behaviour of the &s;pectators? How
am I to paint the impetuous feelings of
that immen&s;e, that exulting multitude?
Half a million of people a&s;&s;embled at a
&s;pectacle, which furni&s;hed every image that
<PB N="6" REF="8">
can elevate the mind of man; which con|nected
the enthu&s;ia&s;m of moral &s;entiment
with the &s;olemn pomp of religious cere|monies;
which addre&s;&s;ed it&s;elf at once to
the imagination, the under&s;tanding, and
the heart!</P>
<P>The Champ de Mars was formed into
an immen&s;e amphitheatre, round which
were erected forty rows of &s;eats, rai&s;ed
one above another with earth, on which
wooden forms were placed. Twenty days
labour, animated by the enthu&s;ia&s;m of the
people, accompli&s;hed what &s;eemed to re|quire
the toil of years. Already in the
Champ de Mars the di&s;tinctions of rank
were forgotten; and, in&s;pired by the &s;ame
&s;pirit, the highe&s;t and lowe&s;t orders of
citizens gloried in taking up the &s;pade,
and a&s;&s;i&s;ting the per&s;ons employed in a
work on which the common welfare of
the &s;tate depended. Ladies took the in|&s;truments
of labour in their hands, and
removed a little of the earth, that they
<PB N="7" REF="9">
might be able to boa&s;t that they al&s;o had
a&s;&s;i&s;ted in the preparations at the Champ
de Mars; and a number of old &s;oldiers
were &s;een voluntarily be&s;towing on their
country the la&s;t remains of their &s;trength.
A young Abb&eacute; of my acquaintance told
me, that the people beat a drum at the
door of the convent where he lived, and
obliged the Superior to let all the Monks
come out and work in the Champ de
Mars. The Superior with great reluct|ance
acquie&s;ced, &startq;Quant &agrave; moi,&endq; &s;aid
the young Abb&eacute;, &startq;je ne demandois pas
mieux<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">As for me, I de&s;ired nothing better.</NOTE>.&endq;</P>
<P>At the upper end of the amphitheatre
a pavilion was built for the reception of
the King, the Queen, their attendants,
and the National A&s;&s;embly, covered with
&s;triped tent-cloth of the national colours,
and decorated with &s;treamers of the &s;ame
beloved tints, and fleur de lys. The
<PB N="8" REF="10">
white flag was di&s;played above the &s;pot
where the King was &s;eated. In the mid|dle
of the Champ de Mars L'Autel de la
Patrie was placed, on which incen&s;e was
burnt by prie&s;ts dre&s;&s;ed in long white
robes, with &s;a&s;hes of national ribbon.
Several in&s;criptions were written on the
altar, but the words vi&s;ible at the greate&s;t
di&s;tance were, La Nation, la Loi, et le
Roi<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">The Nation, the Law, and the King.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>At the lower end of the amphitheatre,
oppo&s;ite to the pavilion, three triumphal
arches were erected, adorned with em|blems
and allegorical figures.</P>
<P>The proce&s;&s;ion marched to the Champ
de Mars, through the central &s;treets of
Paris. At La Place de Louis Quinze,
the e&s;corts, who carried the colours, re|ceived
under their banners, ranged in two
lines, the National A&s;&s;embly, who came
from the Tuilleries. When the proce&s;|&s;ion
<PB N="9" REF="11">
pa&s;&s;ed the &s;treet where Henry the
Fourth was a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated, every man pau&s;ed
as if by general con&s;ent: the cries of joy
were &s;u&s;pended, and &s;ucceeded by a &s;o|lemn
&s;ilence. This tribute of regret,
paid from the &s;udden impul&s;e of feeling
at &s;uch a moment, was perhaps the mo&s;t
honourable te&s;timony to the virtues of
that amiable Prince which his memory
has yet received.</P>
<P>In the &s;treets, at the windows, and on
the roofs of the hou&s;es, the people, tran|&s;ported
with joy, &s;houted and wept as
the proce&s;&s;ion pa&s;&s;ed. Old men were
&s;een kneeling in the &s;treets, ble&s;&s;ing God
that they had lived to witne&s;s that happy
moment. The people ran to the doors
of their hou&s;es loaded with refre&s;hments,
which they offered to the troops; and
crouds of women &s;urrounded the &s;oldiers,
and holding up their infants in their arms,
and melting into tears, promi&s;ed to make
their children imbibe, from their earlie&s;t
<PB N="10" REF="12">
age, an inviolable attachment to the prin|ciples
of the new con&s;titution.</P>
<P>The proce&s;&s;ion entered the Champ de
Mars by a long road, which thou&s;ands of
people had a&s;&s;i&s;ted in forming, by filling
up deep hollows, levelling the ri&s;ing
grounds, and erecting a temporary bridge
acro&s;s the Seine, oppo&s;ite to the trium|phal
arches. The order of the proce&s;|&s;ion
was as follows:</P>
<P>A troop of hor&s;e, with trumpets.</P>
<P>A great band of mu&s;ic.</P>
<P>A detachment of grenadiers.</P>
<P>The electors cho&s;en at Paris in 1789.</P>
<P>A band of volunteers.</P>
<P>The a&s;&s;embly of the repre&s;entatives of
the people.</P>
<P>The military committee.</P>
<P>Company of cha&s;&s;eurs.</P>
<P>A band of drums.</P>
<P>The Pre&s;idents of &s;ixty di&s;tricts.</P>

Federation.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="13">
The Admini&s;trators of the municipality.</P>
<P>Bands of mu&s;ic and drums.</P>
<P>Battalion of children, carrying a &s;tand|ard,
on which was written, L'E&s;pe|rance

<P>Detachment with the colours of the

<P>Battalion of veterans.</P>
<P>Deputies from forty-two departments,

<P>Deputies from the regular troops.</P>
<P>Deputies from the navy.</P>
<P>Deputies from forty-one departments,
arranged al&s;o alphabetically.</P>
<P>Band of volunteer cha&s;&s;eurs.</P>
<P>Troop of hor&s;e, with trumpets.</P>
<P>The proce&s;&s;ion, which was formed with
eight per&s;ons abrea&s;t, entered the Champ
de Mars beneath the triumphal arches,
<PB N="12" REF="14">
with a di&s;charge of cannon. The de|puties
placed them&s;elves round the in&s;ide
of the amphitheatre. Between them and
the &s;eats of the &s;pectators, the national
guard of Paris were ranged; and the
&s;eats round the amphitheatre were filled
with four hundred thou&s;and people. The
middle of the amphitheatre was crouded
with an immen&s;e multitude of &s;oldiers.
The National A&s;&s;embly walked towards
the pavilion, where they placed them&s;elves
with the King, the Queen, the royal fa|mily,
and their attendants; and oppo&s;ite
this group, ro&s;e in per&s;pective the hills
of Pa&s;&s;y and Chaillot, covered with peo|ple.
The &s;tandards, of which one was
pre&s;ented to each department of the king|dom,
as a mark of brotherhood, by the
citizens of Paris, were carried to the
altar to be con&s;ecrated by the bi&s;hop.
High ma&s;s was performed, after which
Mon&s;ieur de la Fayette, who had been
appointed by the King Major General of
<PB N="13" REF="15">
the Federation, a&s;cended the altar, gave
the &s;ignal, and him&s;elf took the national
oath. In an in&s;tant every &s;word was
drawn, and every arm lifted up. The
King pronounced the oath, which the
Pre&s;ident of the National A&s;&s;embly re|peated,
and the &s;olemn words were re|echoed
by &s;ix hundred thou&s;and voices;
while the Queen rai&s;ed the Dauphin in her
arms, &s;hewing him to the people and the
army. At the moment the con&s;ecrated
banners were di&s;played, the &s;un, which
had been ob&s;cured by frequent &s;howers in
the cour&s;e of the morning, bur&s;t forth,
while the people lifted their eyes to hea|ven,
and called upon the Deity to look
down and witne&s;s the &s;acred engagement
into which they entered. A re&s;pectful
&s;ilence was &s;ucceeded by the cries, the
&s;houts, the acclamations of the multitude:
they wept, they embraced each other,
and then di&s;per&s;ed.</P>
<P>You will not &s;u&s;pect that I was an in|different
<PB N="14" REF="16">
witne&s;s of &s;uch a &s;cene. Oh no!
this was not a time in which the di&s;tinc|tions
of country were remembered. It
was the triumph of human kind; it was
man a&s;&s;erting the noble&s;t privileges of his
nature; and it required but the common
feelings of humanity to become in that
moment a citizen of the world. For my|&s;elf,
I acknowledge that my heart caught
with enthu&s;ia&s;m the general &s;ympathy; my
eyes were filled with tears; and I &s;hall ne|ver
forget the &s;en&s;ations of that day, &startq;while
memory holds her &s;eat in my bo&s;om.&endq;</P>
<P>The weather proved very unfavourable
during the morning of the federation;
but the minds of people were too much
elevated by ideas of moral good, to at|tend
to the phy&s;ical evils of the day. Se|veral
heavy &s;howers were far from inter|rupting
the general gaiety. The people,
when drenched by the rain, called out
with exultation, rather than regret,<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">We are wet for the nation.</NOTE> &startq;Nous
<PB N="15" REF="17">
&s;ommes mouillez a la nation.&endq; Some
exclaimed,<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">The French revolution is cemented with water, in&s;tead of blood.</NOTE> &startq;La revolution Fran&ccedil;oi&s;e
e&s;t ciment&eacute;e avec de l'eau, au lieu de
&s;ang.&endq; The national guard, during the
hours which preceded the arrival of the
proce&s;&s;ion, amu&s;ed the &s;pectators<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">With dancing in a circle.</NOTE> d'une
dance ronde, and with a thou&s;and whim|&s;ical
and playful evolutions, highly expre&s;|&s;ive
of that gaiety which di&s;tingui&s;hes the
French character. I believe none but
Frenchmen would have diverted them|&s;elves,
and half a million of people, who
were waiting in expectation of a &s;cene
the mo&s;t &s;olemn upon record, by circles
of ten thou&s;and men galloping<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">In the round dance.</NOTE> en dance
ronde. But if you are di&s;po&s;ed to think
of this gaiety with the contempt of &s;upe|rior
gravity, for I will not call it wi&s;dom,
recollect that the&s;e dancers were the very
men who&s;e bravery formed the great epo|cha
of French liberty; the heroes who
<PB N="16" REF="18">
demoli&s;hed the towers of the Ba&s;tille, and
who&s;e fame will de&s;cend to the late&s;t po&s;|terity.</P>
<P>Such was the admirable order with
which this augu&s;t &s;pectacle was conduct|ed,
that no accident interrupted the uni|ver&s;al
fe&s;tivity. All carriages were for|bidden
during that day, and the entrances
to the Champ de Mars were &s;o nume|rous,
that half a million of people were
collected together without a croud.</P>
<P>The people had only one &s;ubject of re|gret:
they murmured that the king had
taken the national oath in the pavilion,
in&s;tead of performing that ceremony at
the foot of the altar; and &s;ome of them,
crouding round Mon&s;. de la Fayette, con|jured
him to per&s;uade the king to go to
the altar, and take the oath a &s;econd
time.<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">My friends, the oath is not an air which can be played twice over.</NOTE> &startq;Mes enfans,&endq; &s;aid Mon&s;. de la
Fayette, &startq;le &s;erment n'e&s;t pas une ariette,
on ne peut pas le jouer deux fois.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="19">
Mon&s;. de la Fayette, after the Federa|tion,
went to the Chateau de la Muette,
where a public dinner was prepared for
the national guard. An immen&s;e croud
gathered round him when he alighted
from his hor&s;e, at a little di&s;tance from the
chateau, and &s;ome Ari&s;tocrates, mixing
them&s;elves with the true wor&s;hippers of
him who is &s;o ju&s;tly the idol of the French
nation, attempted to &s;tifle him with their
embraces. He called out &startq;<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">But, my friends, you &s;tifle me.</NOTE> <HI>Mais, mes
amis, vous m'etouffez!</HI>&endq; and one of his <HI>aide
de camps,</HI> who perceived the danger of his
general, threw him&s;elf from his hor&s;e,
which he intreated Mon&s;. de la Fayette
to mount. He did &s;o, and ha&s;tened to
the chateau.</P>
<P>This incident reminds me of a line in
Racine's fine tragedy of Britannicus, where
Nero &s;ays,
<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">I embrace my rival, but it is to de&s;troy him.</NOTE> &startq;J'embra&s;&s;e mon rival, mais c'e&s;t pour l'etouffer.&endq;</P>

<PB N="18" REF="20">
<HEAD>LETTER III.</HEAD>
<P>THE rejoicings at Paris did not ter|minate
with the ceremony of the Federa|tion.
A &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of entertainments,
which la&s;ted &s;everal days, were prepared
for the deputies from the provinces, who
were all quartered in the hou&s;es of the
bourgeois, where they were received with
the mo&s;t cordial ho&s;pitality.</P>
<P>The night of the 14th of July the whole
city of Paris was illuminated, and the
next day le ci-devant Duc, now Mon&s;.
d'Orleans, gave a public dinner to the na|tional
guard in the hall of the Palais
Royal. We walked in the evening round
the gallery, from which we &s;aw part of
the croud below amu&s;ing them&s;elves by
dancing, while others were &s;inging in
chorus the favourite national &s;ongs.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="21">
On the following Sunday the national
guards were reviewed by Mon&s;. de la
Fayette in the Champ de Mars, which
was again filled with &s;pectators, and the
people appeared more enthu&s;ia&s;tic than
ever in their applau&s;es of their general.
The Champ de Mars re&s;ounded with re|peated
cries of<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Long live Mon&s;. de la Fayette.</NOTE> &startq;Vive Mon&s;. de la Fay|ette.&endq;
On this day carriages were again
forbidden, and the evening di&s;played a
&s;cene of general rejoicing. The whole
city was illuminated, and crouds of com|pany
filled the gardens of the Tuilleries,
from which we &s;aw the beautiful fa&ccedil;ade
of the Louvre lighted in the mo&s;t &s;plen|did
manner. In the Champs Ely&s;&eacute;es,
where a f&ecirc;te was given to the Deputies,
innumerable lamps were hung from one
row of trees to another, and &s;hed the mo&s;t
agreeable brilliance on tho&s;e enchanting
walks; where the exhilarated croud danced
<PB N="20" REF="22">
and &s;ung, and filled the air with the &s;ound
of rejoicing. Several parties of the na|tional
guard came from the Champ Ely|&s;&eacute;es,
dancing along the walks of the Tuil|leries
with a woman between every two
men; and all the prie&s;ts, whom they met
in their way, they obliged to join in the
dance, treating them as women, by placing
them between two &s;oldiers, and &s;ome|times
&s;portively dre&s;&s;ing them in grena|diers
caps. Fire-works of great variety
and beauty were exhibited on the Pont
Neuf, and the &s;tatue of Henry the Fourth
was decorated with the ornament of all
others the mo&s;t dear in the eyes of the
people, a &s;carf of national ribbon. Tran&s;|parencies
of Mon&s;. de la Fayette and
Mon&s;. Bailly were placed, as the highe&s;t
mark of public favour, on each &s;ide of this
revered &s;tatue.</P>
<P>But the &s;pectacle of all others the mo&s;t
intere&s;ting to my feelings, was the re|joicings
at the Ba&s;tille. The ruins of that
<PB N="21" REF="23">
execrable fortre&s;s were &s;uddenly tran&s;|formed,
as if with the wand of necro|mancy,
into a &s;cene of beauty and of plea|&s;ure.
The ground was covered with fre&s;h
clods of gra&s;s, upon which young trees
were placed in rows, and illuminated with
a blaze of light. Here the minds of the
people took a higher tone of exultation
than in the other &s;cenes of fe&s;tivity. Their
mutual congratulations, their reflections
on the horror of the pa&s;t, their &s;en&s;e of
pre&s;ent felicity, their cries of<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Long live the Nation.</NOTE> &startq;Vive la
Nation,&endq; &s;till ring in my ear! I too, though
but a &s;ojourner in their land, rejoiced in
their happine&s;s, joined the univer&s;al voice,
and repeated with all my heart and &s;oul,
&startq;Vive la nation!&endq;</P>

<HEAD>LETTER IV.</HEAD>
<P>BEFORE I &s;uffered my friends at
Paris to conduct me through the u&s;ual
routine of convents, churches, and pala|ces,
I reque&s;ted to vi&s;it the Ba&s;tille; feel|ing
a much &s;tronger de&s;ire to contemplate
the ruins of that building than the mo&s;t
perfect edifices of Paris. When we got
into the carriage, our French &s;ervant called
to the coachman, with an air of triumph,
<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">To the Ba&s;tille,&mdash;but we &s;hall not remain there.</NOTE> &startq;A la Ba&s;tille&mdash;mais nous n'y re&s;te|rons

which &s;o many wretches have entered ne|ver

de&s;cended with difficulty into the
dungeons, which were too low to admit
of our &s;tanding upright, and &s;o dark that
we were obliged at noon-day to vi&s;it them
<PB N="23" REF="25">
with the light of a candle. We &s;aw the
hooks of tho&s;e chains by which the pri|&s;oners
were fa&s;tened round the neck, to

<P>There appears to be a greater number
of the&s;e dungeons than one could have
imagined the hard heart of tyranny it&s;elf

<PB N="24" REF="26">
of ground which was inclo&s;ed within the

<P>After having vi&s;ited the Ba&s;tille, we

<P>Tho&s;e who have contemplated the dun|geons

<P>The Ba&s;tille, which Henry the Fourth
and his veteran troops a&s;&s;ailed in vain, the
citizens of Paris had the glory of taking
in a few hours. The avarice of Mon&s;.
de Launay had tempted him to guard
this fortre&s;s with only half the comple|ment
of men ordered by government;
and a letter which he received the morn|ing
of the 14th of July, commanding him
to &s;u&s;tain the &s;iege till the evening, when
&s;uccour would arrive, joined to his own
treachery towards the a&s;&s;ailants, co&s;t him
his life.</P>
<P>The courage of the be&s;iegers was in|flamed
by the horrors of famine, there
being at this time only twenty-four hours
provi&s;ion of bread in Paris. For &s;ome
days the people had a&s;&s;embled in crouds
round the &s;hops of the bakers, who were
obliged to have a guard of &s;oldiers to
protect them from the fami&s;hed multi|tude;
<PB N="27" REF="29">
while the women, rendered furious
by want, cried, in the re&s;olute tone of de|&s;pair,
<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">We mu&s;t have bread for our children.</NOTE> &startq;Il nous faut du pain pour nos
enfans.&endq; Such was the &s;carcity of bread,
that a French gentleman told me, that,
the day preceding the taking of the Ba&s;|tille,
he was invited to dine with a Nego|tiant,
and, when he went, was informed
that a &s;ervant had been out five hours in
&s;earch of bread, and had at la&s;t been able
to purcha&s;e only one loaf.</P>
<P>It was at this cri&s;is, it was to &s;ave them|&s;elves
the &s;hocking &s;pectacle of their
wives and infants peri&s;hing before their
eyes, that the citizens of Paris flew to
arms, and, impelled by &s;uch cau&s;es, fought
with the daring intrepidity of men who
had all that renders life of any value at
&s;take, and who determined to die or con|quer.
The women too, far from indulg|ing
the fears incident to our feeble &s;ex, in
<PB N="28" REF="30">
defiance of the cannon of the Ba&s;tille, ven|tured
to bring victuals to their &s;ons and
hu&s;bands; and, with a &s;pirit worthy of Ro|man
matrons, encouraged them to go
on. Women mounted guard in the
&s;treets, and, when any per&s;on pa&s;&s;ed, called
out boldly,<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Who goes there?</NOTE> &startq;Qui va la?&endq;</P>
<P>A gentleman, who had the command
of fifty men in this enterprize, told me,
that one of his &s;oldiers being killed by a
cannon-ball, the people, with great marks
of indignation, removed the corp&s;e, and
then, &s;natching up the dead man's hat,
begged money of the by&s;tanders for his
interment, in a manner characteri&s;tic
enough of that gaiety, which never for|&s;akes
the French, even on &s;uch occa&s;ions
as would make any other people on earth

As the heroes of the Ba&s;tille pa&s;&s;ed
along the &s;treets after its &s;urrender, the
citizens &s;tood at the doors of their hou&s;es
loaded with wine, brandy, and other re|fre&s;hments,
which they offered to the&s;e

unanimou&s;ly refu&s;ed to ta&s;te any &s;trong

<P>All tho&s;e who had a&s;&s;i&s;ted in taking the

<P>I have heard &s;everal per&s;ons mention a
young man, of a little in&s;ignificant figure,
who, the day before the Ba&s;tille was taken,
got up on a chair in the Palais Royal, and
harangued the multitude, conjuring them
to make a &s;truggle for their liberty, and
a&s;&s;erting, that now the moment was ar|rived.
They li&s;tened to his eloquence
with the mo&s;t eager attention; and, when
he had in&s;tructed as many as could hear
him at one time, he reque&s;ted them to
depart, and repeated his harangue to a

<HEAD>LETTER V.</HEAD>
<P>I Am ju&s;t returned from a vi&s;it to Ma|dame
Sillery, who&s;e works on education
are &s;o well known and &s;o ju&s;tly e&s;teemed
in England, and who received me with
the mo&s;t engaging politene&s;s. Surely
the French are unrivalled in the arts of
plea&s;ing; in the power of uniting with
the mo&s;t poli&s;hed elegance of manners,
that attentive kindne&s;s which &s;eems to
flow warm from the heart, and which,
while it &s;ooths our vanity, &s;ecures our
affections. Madame Sillery and her pu|pils
are at pre&s;ent at St. Leu, a beau|tiful
&s;pot in the rich valley of Mont|morenci.
Mon&s;. d'Orleans has cer|tainly
conferred a mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential obliga|tion
upon his children, by placing them
under the care of this lady. I never met
<PB N="34" REF="36">
with young people more amiable in their
di&s;po&s;itions, or more charming in their
manners, which are equally remote from
arrogance, and from tho&s;e efforts of con|de&s;cen&s;ion
which I have &s;een &s;ome great
people make, with much difficulty to
them&s;elves, and much offence to others.
The Prince&s;s, who is thirteen years of
age, has a countenance of the &s;weete&s;t
expre&s;&s;ion, and appears to me to be Ade|laide,
the heroine of Madame Sillery's
Letters on Education, per&s;onified. The
three princes, though under Madame Sil|lery's
&s;uperintendence, have al&s;o precep|tors
who live in the hou&s;e, and a&s;&s;i&s;t in
their education. The elde&s;t prince, Mon&s;.
de Chartres, is nearly eighteen years of
age, and his attentive politene&s;s formed a
&s;triking contra&s;t in my mind, to the man|ners
of tho&s;e fa&s;hionable gentlemen in a
certain great metropolis, who con&s;ider
apathy and negligence as the te&s;t of good|breeding.
But if I was plea&s;ed with the
<PB N="35" REF="37">
manners of this young Prince, I was &s;till
more delighted to find him a confirmed
friend to the new con&s;titution of France,
and willing, with the enthu&s;ia&s;m of a young
and ardent mind, to renounce the &s;plen|dour
of his titles for the general good.
When he heard that the &s;acrifice of
fortune al&s;o was required, and that the
immen&s;e property, which he had been
taught to con&s;ider as his inheritance, was
to be divided with his brothers, he em|braced
them with the utmo&s;t affection,
declaring that he &s;hould rejoice in &s;uch a
divi&s;ion. To find a democratic Prince,
was &s;omewhat &s;ingular: I was much le&s;s
&s;urprized that Madame Sillery had adopt|ed
&s;entiments which are &s;o congenial to
an enlarged and comprehen&s;ive mind.
This lady I have called Sillery, becau&s;e it
is the name by which &s;he is known in
England; but, &s;ince the decree of the Na|tional
A&s;&s;embly, aboli&s;hing the nobility,
<PB N="36" REF="38">
&s;he has renounced with her title the name
of Sillery, and has taken that of Brulart.</P>
<P>She talked to me of the di&s;tinctions of
rank, in the &s;pirit of philo&s;ophy, and ri|diculed
the ab&s;urdity of converting the
rewards of per&s;onal merit into the inhe|ritance
of tho&s;e who had perhaps &s;o little
claim to honours, that they were a &s;ort of
oblique reproach on their character and
conduct. There may be arguments
again&s;t hereditary rank &s;ufficiently con|vincing
to &s;uch an under&s;tanding as Ma|dame
Brulart's: but I know &s;ome French
ladies who entertain very different notions
on this &s;ubject; who &s;ee no impropriety
in the e&s;tabli&s;hments of nobility; and
who have carried their love of ari&s;tocra|tical
rights &s;o far as to keep their beds, in
a fit of de&s;pondency, upon being obliged
to relinqui&s;h the agreeable epithets of
Comte&s;&s;e or Marqui&s;e, to which their ears
had been &s;o long accu&s;tomed.</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="39">
But let me do ju&s;tice to the ladies of
France. The number of tho&s;e who have
murmured at the lo&s;s of rank, bears a very
&s;mall proportion to tho&s;e who have acted
with a &s;pirit of di&s;tingui&s;hed patrioti&s;m;
who, with tho&s;e generous affections which
belong to the female heart, have gloried in
&s;acrificing titles, fortune, and even the per|&s;onal
ornaments, &s;o dear to female vanity,
for the common cau&s;e. It was the ladies
who gave the example of le don patrio|tique
<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">The patriotic donation.</NOTE>, by offering their jewels at the
&s;hrine of liberty; and, if the women of
ancient Rome have gained the applau&s;e of
di&s;tant ages for &s;uch actions, the women
of France will al&s;o claim the admiration
of po&s;terity.</P>
<P>The women have certainly had a con|&s;iderable
&s;hare in the French revolution:
for, whatever the imperious lords of the
creation may fancy, the mo&s;t important
<PB N="38" REF="40">
events which take place in this world de|pend
a little on our influence; and we
often act in human affairs like tho&s;e &s;ecret
&s;prings in mechani&s;m, by which, though
invi&s;ible, great movements are regulated.</P>
<P>But let us return to Madame Brulart,
who wears at her brea&s;t a medallion made
of a &s;tone of the Ba&s;tille poli&s;hed. In
the middle of the medallion, <HI>Libert&eacute;</HI> was
written in diamonds; above was marked,
in diamonds, the planet that &s;hone on the
14th of July; and below was &s;een the
moon, of the &s;ize &s;he appeared that me|morable
night. The medallion was &s;et
in a branch of laurel, compo&s;ed of eme|ralds,
and tied at the top with the national
cockade, formed of brilliant &s;tones of the
three national colours.</P>
<P>Our conver&s;ation on the &s;ubject of the
Ba&s;tille, led Madame Brulart to relate an
action of Mon&s;. de Chartres, which re|flects
the highe&s;t honour on his humanity.
Being in Normandy, he vi&s;ited Mont St.
<PB N="39" REF="41">
Michel, a fortre&s;s built on a rock which
&s;tands a league and a half from the coa&s;t
of Normandy. The tide covers this &s;pace
twice every twenty-four hours; but when
it is low-water, a per&s;on can pa&s;s over on
foot. Mont St. Michel was originally a
church, founded by a good bi&s;hop in the
&s;eventh century, in honour of St. Michel,
who, it &s;eems, appeared to him in a vi&s;ion
on this &s;pot. Richard, the fir&s;t Duke of
Normandy of that name, afterwards con|verted
the church into an abbey, and this
abbey gave ri&s;e to the military order des
Chevaliers de St. Michel, in&s;tituted by
Louis the Eleventh. After having &s;een the
precious relics of the abbey, the &s;quare
buckler, and the &s;hort &s;word found in
Ireland near the body of the well-known
dragon, who&s;e de&s;truction is attributed to
the prowe&s;s of St. Michel, Mon&s;. de Char|tres
was conducted, through many laby|rinths,
to the &s;ubterraneous parts of the
edifice; where he was &s;hewn a wooden
<PB N="40" REF="42">
cage, which was made by order of Louis
the Fourteenth, for the puni&s;hment of an
unfortunate wit, who had dared to ridi|cule
his conque&s;ts in Holland, no &s;ooner
gained than lo&s;t. Mon&s;. de Chartres
beheld with horror this in&s;trument of
tyranny, in which pri&s;oners were &s;till
frequently confined; and, expre&s;&s;ing in
very &s;trong terms his indignation, he was
told, that, as a prince of the blood, he
had a right, if he thought proper, to
order the cage to be de&s;troyed. Scarcely
were the words pronounced, when the
young Prince &s;eized a hatchet, gave the
fir&s;t &s;troke him&s;elf to this execrable ma|chine,
waited to &s;ee it levelled with the
ground, and thus may claim the glory or
having, even before the demolition of the
Ba&s;tille, begun the French revolution.</P>
<P>We found at St. Leu a young Engli&s;h
lady, who is the companion of the Prin|ce&s;s,
and who&s;e appearance is calculated
to give the mo&s;t favourable idea of Eng|li&s;h
<PB N="41" REF="43">
beauty. I never &s;aw more regular
features, or an expre&s;&s;ion of countenance
more lovely: and Madame Brulart, by
whom &s;he has been educated, a&s;&s;ured me
that &startq;the mind keeps the promi&s;e we
had from the face.&endq; This young lady
talked of her own country with a glow of
&s;atisfaction very grateful to my feelings.
She &s;eems to,

<P>I Have been at the National A&s;&s;embly,
where, at a time when the deputies from
the provinces engro&s;&s;ed every ticket of

without tickets, by the gentleman who
had the command of the guard, and placed
in the be&s;t &s;eats, before he &s;uffered the
doors to be opened to other people. We
had no per&s;onal acquaintance with this
gentleman, or any claim to his politene&s;s,
except that of being foreigners and wo|men;
but the&s;e are, of all claims, the
mo&s;t powerful to the urbanity of French

<P>My &s;i&s;ter ob&s;erved to me, that our &s;eats,

&s;ame &s;ituation in We&s;tmin&s;ter Hall. But
you mu&s;t recollect, I an&s;wered, that we
have attained this &s;ituation without any

fame of Mr. Fox's eloquence &s;hould lead
a French woman to pre&s;ent her&s;elf at the
door of We&s;tmin&s;ter Hall without a tic|ket,
&s;he might &s;tand there as long as Mr.
Ha&s;tings's trial has la&s;ted, without being
permitted to pa&s;s the barrier.</P>
<P>The hall of the National A&s;&s;embly is
long and narrow; at each end there is a
gallery, where the common people are
admitted by applying very early in the
morning for numbers, which are di&s;tri|buted
at the door; and the per&s;ons
who fir&s;t apply &s;ecure the fir&s;t numbers.
The &s;eats being al&s;o numbered, all con|fu&s;ion
and di&s;order are prevented. The
galleries at the &s;ide of the hall are di|vided
into boxes, which are called tri|bunes.
They belong to the principal
members of the National A&s;&s;embly, and
<PB N="44" REF="46">
to the&s;e places company are admitted
with tickets. Rows of &s;eats are placed
round the hall, rai&s;ed one above another,
where the members of the A&s;&s;embly are
&s;eated; and immediately oppo&s;ite the chair
of the pre&s;ident, in the narrow part of
the hall, is the tribune which the mem|bers
a&s;cend when they are going to &s;peak.
One capital &s;ubject of debate in this A&s;|&s;embly
is, who &s;hall &s;peak fir&s;t; for all
&s;eem more inclined to talk than to li&s;ten;
and &s;ometimes the pre&s;ident in vain rings
a bell, or with the vehemence of French
action &s;tretches out his arms, and endea|vours
to impo&s;e &s;ilence; while the &s;ix
Hui&s;&s;ers, per&s;ons who are appointed to

little &s;ucce&s;s as the pre&s;ident him&s;elf. But
one cea&s;es to wonder that the meetings of
the National A&s;&s;embly are tumultuous,
on reflecting how important are the ob|jects
of its deliberations. Not only the
lives and fortunes of individuals, but the
<PB N="45" REF="47">
exi&s;tence of the country is at &s;take: and
of how little con&s;equence is this impe|tuo&s;ity
in debate, if the decrees which are
pa&s;&s;ed are wi&s;e and beneficial, and the new
con&s;titution ari&s;es, like the beauty and
order of nature, from the confu&s;ion of
mingled elements! I heard &s;everal of
the members &s;peak; but I am &s;o little
qualified to judge of oratory, that, with|out
pre&s;uming to determine whether I
had rea&s;on to be entertained or not, I
&s;hall only tell you that I was &s;o.</P>
<P>And this, repeated I with exultation to
my&s;elf, this is the National A&s;&s;embly of
France! Tho&s;e men now before my eyes
are the men who engro&s;s the attention, the
a&s;toni&s;hment of Europe; for the i&s;&s;ue of
who&s;e decrees &s;urrounding nations wait in
&s;u&s;pence, and who&s;e fame has already ex|tended
through every civilized region of
the globe: the men who&s;e magnanimity
inve&s;ted them with power to de&s;troy the
old con&s;titution, and who&s;e wi&s;dom is
<PB N="46" REF="48">
erecting the new, on a principle of perfec|tion
which has hitherto been thought chi|merical,
and has only &s;erved to adorn the
page of the philo&s;opher; but which they
believe may be reduced to practice, and
have therefore the courage to attempt.
My mind, with a &s;en&s;ation of elevated plea|&s;ure,
pa&s;&s;ing through the interval of ages,
anticipated the increa&s;ing renown of the&s;e
legi&s;lators, and the period when, all the
nations of Europe following the liberal
&s;y&s;tem which France has adopted, the
little crooked policy of the pre&s;ent times
&s;hall give place to the reign of rea&s;on,
virtue, and &s;cience.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t celebrated characters in the
National A&s;&s;embly were pointed out to
us. Mon&s;ieur Barnave de Dauphine,
who is only &s;ix and twenty years of age,
and the younge&s;t member of the A&s;&s;em|bly,
is e&s;teemed its fir&s;t orator, and is the
leader of the democratic party. I believe
Mon&s;. Barnave does not owe all his re|putation
<PB N="47" REF="49">
to his talents, however di&s;tin|gui&s;hed:
his virtues al&s;o claim a con&s;ider|able
&s;hare of that applau&s;e which he re|ceives
from his country. He has &s;hewn
him&s;elf as &s;tedfa&s;t in principle, as he is
eloquent in debate. With firm undevi|ating
integrity he has defended the cau&s;e
of the people. Every motion he has
made in the A&s;&s;embly has pa&s;&s;ed into a
law, becau&s;e its beneficial tendency has
been always evident; and it was he who
effected that memorable decree which
deprived the King of the power of mak|ing
war, without the con&s;ent of the na|tion.
Mon&s;. Barnave is adored by the
people; who have two or three times ta|ken
the hor&s;es from his carriage, and
drawn him in triumph along the &s;treets
of Paris.</P>
<P>We al&s;o &s;aw Mon&s;. Mirabeau l'ain&eacute;,
who&s;e genius is of the fir&s;t cla&s;s, but who
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es a very &s;mall &s;hare of popularity.
I am, however, one of his partizans,
<PB N="48" REF="50">
though not merely from that enthu&s;ia&s;m
which always comes acro&s;s my heart in
favour of great intellectual abilities. Mon&s;.
Mirabeau has another very powerful claim
on my partiality: he is the profe&s;&s;ed friend
(and I mu&s;t and will love him for being
&s;o) of the African race. He has pro|po&s;ed
the abolition of the &s;lave trade to
the National A&s;&s;embly, and, though the
A&s;&s;embly have delayed the con&s;ideration
of this &s;ubject, on account of tho&s;e deli|berations
which immediately affect the
country, yet, perhaps, if our &s;enators con|tinue
to doze over this affair as they have
hitherto done, the French will have the
glory of &s;etting us an example, which it
will then be our humble employment to
follow. But I tru&s;t the period will never
come, when England will &s;ubmit to be
taught by another nation the le&s;&s;on of hu|manity.
I tru&s;t an Engli&s;h Hou&s;e of
Commons will never per&s;i&s;t in thinking,
that what is morally wrong, can be poli|tically
<PB N="49" REF="51">
right; that the virtue and the pro&s;|perity
of a people are things at variance
with each other; and that a country which
abounds with &s;o many &s;ources of wealth,
cannot afford to clo&s;e one polluted chan|nel,
which is &s;tained with the blood of
our fellow-creatures.</P>
<P>But it is a &s;ort of trea&s;on to the honour,
the &s;pirit, the genero&s;ity of Engli&s;hmen,
to &s;uppo&s;e they will per&s;evere in &s;uch
conduct. Admitting, however, a &s;uppo|&s;ition
which it is painful to make; admit|ting
that they &s;hould abide by this &s;y&s;tem
of inhumanity, they will only retard, but
will not finally prevent the abolition of
&s;lavery. The Africans have not long to
&s;uffer, nor their oppre&s;&s;ors to triumph.
Europe is ha&s;tening towards a period too
enlightened for the perpetuation of &s;uch
mon&s;trous abu&s;es. The mi&s;ts of igno|rance
and error are rolling fa&s;t away, and
the benign beams of philo&s;ophy are &s;pread|ing
their lu&s;tre over the nations.&mdash;But
<PB N="50" REF="52">
whither have the&s;e children of captivity
led me? I perceive I have wandered a
great way from the National A&s;&s;embly,
where I was &s;o happily &s;eated, and of
which I will tell you more in my next

<HEAD>LETTER VII.</HEAD>
<P>THE Abb&eacute; Maury is one of the mo&s;t
di&s;tingui&s;hed members of the National
A&s;&s;embly. He po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es a&s;toni&s;hing pow|ers
of eloquence; but he has done his
talents the inju&s;tice to make them &s;ub|&s;ervient
to the narrow con&s;iderations of
&s;elf-intere&s;t. Had he di&s;played that abi|lity
in defence of civil and religious li|berty,
which he has employed in the &s;er|vice
of the exorbitant preten&s;ions of the
church, he would have de&s;erved the high|e&s;t
applau&s;e of his country; in&s;tead of
which, he has called to the aid of his ge|nius
an auxiliary it ought to have &s;corned;
that &s;ubtlety which tries &startq;to make the
wor&s;e appear the better rea&s;on;&endq; and he
is &s;till more dete&s;ted than admired. I am
not &s;urprized that a little mind is &s;ome|times
<PB N="52" REF="54">
tempted by intere&s;t to tread in a
mean and &s;ordid path; but I own it does
a&s;toni&s;h me that genius can be &s;educed
from the fair field of honourable fame
into tho&s;e &s;erpentine ways where it can
meet with no object worthy of its ambi|tion.
&startq;Something too much of this.&endq;
You &s;hall hear a repartee of the Abb&eacute;
Maury, who, after having made a very
unpopular motion in the A&s;&s;embly, was
in&s;ulted as he was going out; the people
crying, as they are too apt to do,<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">To the lantern.</NOTE> &startq;A la

The Abb&eacute; Maury, before the revolution,
was in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of eight hundred farms,
and has lo&s;t &s;ixty thou&s;and livres a year
in con&s;equence of that event. But enough

and the Abb&eacute; jumps up, and occa&s;ions
much &s;urprize and merriment. The joke,
however, is grown a little &s;tale in France:
but I &s;hall bring the Abb&eacute; with me to
England, where I flatter my&s;elf his &s;udden
appearance will afford &s;ome diver&s;ion.</P>
<P>A &s;ingular but very re&s;pectable figure
in the National A&s;&s;embly is a Deputy
from Britany, called Le Pere Gerard.
This venerable old man is a pea&s;ant, and
his appearance reminds one of tho&s;e times
when Generals were called from the
plough to take the command of armies.
The dre&s;s of Le Pere Gerard is made of
a coar&s;e woollen cloth, which is worn by
the pea&s;ants of Britany, and is of &s;uch
&s;trong texture that a coat often de&s;cends
from one generation to another. This
cloth is called Pinchina; and the King, to
whom the old Breton has pre&s;ented &s;everal
<PB N="54" REF="56">
addre&s;&s;es from the A&s;&s;embly, calls him,
<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">In plea&s;antry, Father Pinchina.</NOTE> en badinage, Le Pere Pinchina. When
I &s;aw him, he had on this everla&s;ting coat,
and wore wor&s;ted &s;tockings gartered
above the knees. But, what plea&s;ed me
mo&s;t in his appearance, were the long
white hairs which hung down his &s;houl|ders;
an ornament for which you know I
have a particular predilection.</P>
<P>The re&s;pectable Pere Gerard boa&s;ts
that he is de&s;cended from a race of depu|ties,
his great grandfather having been
cho&s;en as a deputy to Les Etats Gene|raux
in 1614, the la&s;t time the States were
held, before that memorable period when
they effected the revolution.</P>
<P>At the time when the ladies &s;et the ex|ample

took the &s;ilver buckles out of their
&s;hoes, and laid them on the Pre&s;ident's
table, the Pere Gerard ro&s;e, and &s;aid, that
he had no &s;uch offering to give, his buckles
being made of bra&s;s, but that his don pa|triotique
&s;hould be that of rendering his
&s;ervices to his country unpaid. The old
man was heard by the A&s;&s;embly with the
applau&s;e he merited; and the people, on
the day of the Federation, carried him
from the Champ de Mars to his own
hou&s;e in triumph on their &s;houlders.</P>
<P>Me&s;&s;ieurs Charles and Alexander La|meth,
two brothers, and Mon&s;. Rabeau
de St. E&s;tienne, are among the fir&s;t pa|triots
of the National A&s;&s;embly, and have
a very high reputation for talents. The
French, who love what they call an

vaut deux d'Mirabeau.</P>
<P>The meetings of the A&s;&s;embly, though
&s;till tumultuous, are much le&s;s &s;o than
<PB N="56" REF="58">
they were at their fir&s;t commencement.
A gentleman, who was pre&s;ent when the
motion was made for aboli&s;hing mona&s;te|ries,
told me, that the minds of the mem|bers
were, on that occa&s;ion, inflamed to
&s;uch a height, that it appeared to him
very probable, that the debate would end
in a ma&s;&s;acre. He mentioned a circum|&s;tance
very characteri&s;tic of French viva|city.
One of the members was expre&s;&s;ing
him&s;elf in the&s;e words, &startq;What is a Monk?
A man who has renounced his father, his
mother, every tie, every affection that is
dear in nature! and for whom?&endq;&mdash;before
the &s;peaker could fini&s;h his &s;entence, a
member from the other end of the hall
&s;eized the moment while the orator was
drawing his breath, and called out<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">For a foreign power.</NOTE> &startq;Pour
une pui&s;&s;ance etrangere,&endq; to the great
horror of la cot&eacute; noir, for &s;o the clergy are
called.</P>
<P><PB N="57" REF="59">
The Democrates place them&s;elves on
one &s;ide of the hall, and the Ari&s;tocrates
on the other. The &s;pectators in the gal|leries
take &s;uch a part in the debate, as
frequently to expre&s;s their applau&s;e by
clapping their hands with great violence.
An old Marechal of France ro&s;e, the day
I was at the A&s;&s;embly, when they were
debating on the military pen&s;ions, and de|clared,
that in recompen&s;e for the &s;ervices
which he had rendered his country, he
de&s;ired honours and not pay. The A&s;|&s;embly
clapped him, and the galleries
joined in this mark of approbation. A
young Frenchman, who &s;at next me,
whi&s;pered to me,<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">I &s;uppo&s;e that gentleman finds money trou|ble&s;ome.</NOTE> &startq;Mon&s;. trouve appa|ramment
que l'argent l'incommode.&endq;</P>
<P>The members of the National A&s;&s;em|bly
are paid three crowns a day for their
attendance; while in England a candi|date
for a &s;eat in parliament often &s;pends
<PB N="58" REF="60">
many thou&s;and pounds, and, with magni|ficent
genero&s;ity, makes a whole county
drunk for a week, merely to enjoy the
privilege of &s;erving his country without
pay.</P>
<P>The qualification requi&s;ite for a mem|ber
of the National A&s;&s;embly, is that of
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing &s;ufficient property in land or
hou&s;es to pay taxes to the amount of a
marc d'argent, which is the value of four
louis. Every hundred of the citizens, who
pay taxes to government of three days
labour, or three livres, have a right to
vote for an elector; who&s;e qualification is
that of paying taxes to the amount of ten
livres, or ten days labour. The electors
of one department meet together in one
a&s;&s;embly, and chu&s;e from among their
own body the per&s;ons who are to direct
the admini&s;tration of that department.
Tho&s;e electors will al&s;o chu&s;e in the &s;ame
manner the deputies &s;ent by that depart|ment
to the National A&s;&s;embly. There
<PB N="59" REF="61">
will therefore be only one intermediate
degree between the lowe&s;t order of active
citizens, and the members of the National
A&s;&s;embly.</P>
<P>I was interrupted by a vi&s;itor, who re|lated
a little incident, which has intere&s;ted
me &s;o much, that I can write of nothing
el&s;e at pre&s;ent, and you &s;hall therefore
have it warm from my heart. While the
National A&s;&s;embly were deliberating upon
the divi&s;ion of property among brothers,
a young man of high birth and fortune,
who is a member of the A&s;&s;embly, entered
with precipitation, and, mounting the tri|bune,
with great emotion informed the
A&s;&s;embly, that he had ju&s;t received ac|counts
that his father was dying; that he
him&s;elf was his elde&s;t &s;on, and had come
to conjure the A&s;&s;embly to pa&s;s, without
delay, that equitable decree, giving the
younger &s;ons an equal &s;hare of fortune
with the elde&s;t, in order, he &s;aid, that his
father might have the &s;atisfaction, before
<PB N="60" REF="62">
he breathed his la&s;t, of knowing that all
his children were &s;ecure of a provi&s;ion.
If you are not affected by this circum|&s;tance,
you have read it with very differ|ent
feelings from tho&s;e with which I have
written it: but if, on the contrary, you
have fallen in love with this young French|man,
do not imagine your pa&s;&s;ion is &s;in|gular,

my&s;elf.</P>

<P>YOU have not heard, perhaps, that
on the day of the Federation at Paris, the
national oath was taken throughout the
whole kingdom, at the hour of twelve.</P>
<P>A great number of farmers and pea|&s;ants
walked in the proce&s;&s;ion at Rouen,
bearing in their hands the in&s;truments of
their hu&s;bandry, decorated with national
ribbons. The national guard cut down
branches from the trees, and &s;tuck them
in their hats; and a French gentleman of
my acquaintance, who under&s;tands Eng|li&s;h,
and reads Shake&s;peare, told me, that
it &s;eemed like Birnham Wood coming to
Dun&s;inane.</P>
<P>The leaders of the French revolution,
are men well acquainted with the human
heart. They have not tru&s;ted merely to
<PB N="62" REF="64">
the force of rea&s;on, but have &s;tudied to
intere&s;t in their cau&s;e the mo&s;t powerful
pa&s;&s;ions of human nature, by the ap|pointment
of &s;olemnities perfectly calcu|lated
to awaken that general &s;ympathy
which is caught from heart to heart with
irre&s;i&s;tible energy, fills every eye with
tears, and thr$bs in every bo&s;om.</P>
<P>I have heard of a proce&s;&s;ion, which took
place not long ago in one of the di&s;tricts
of Paris, in which five hundred young
ladies walked dre&s;&s;ed in white, and deco|rated
with cockades of the national rib|bon,
leading by &s;ilken cords a number of
pri&s;oners newly relea&s;ed from captivity;
and who, with their faces covered by long
flowing veils, were conducted to a church,
where they returned thanks for their deli|verance.</P>
<P>Thus have the leaders of the revolution
engaged beauty as one of their auxiliaries,
ju&s;tly concluding, that, to the gallantry and
&s;en&s;ibility of Frenchmen, no argument

would be found more efficacious than that
of a pretty face.</P>
<P>I have ju&s;t read a private letter from
a little town about two leagues from Mont|auban,
called Negre-Peli&s;&s;e, where the
inhabitants, on the day of the Federation,
di&s;played a liberality of &s;entiment, which
reflects honour, not only on them&s;elves,
but on the age in which we live. The
national guard of this little town and its
environs, were a&s;&s;embled to take the na|tional
oath. Half of the inhabitants be|ing
Prote&s;tants, and the other half Catho|lics,
the Cur&eacute; and the Prote&s;tant Mini&s;ter
a&s;cended together one altar, which had
been erected by the citizens, and admi|ni&s;tered
the oath to their re&s;pective pa|ri&s;hioners
at the &s;ame moment, after
which, Catholics and Prote&s;tants joined
in &s;inging Te Deum.</P>
<P>Surely religious wor&s;hip was never per|formed

the incen&s;e of prai&s;e was never more likely
to a&s;cend to heaven, than when the Ca|tholics
and Prote&s;tants of Negre-Peli&s;&s;e
offered it together!</P>
<P>This amiable community, when their
devotions were fini&s;hed, walked in pro|ce&s;&s;ion
to a &s;pot where fire-works had
been prepared; and, it being con&s;idered
as a mark of honour to light the fire|works,
the office was re&s;erved for Mon&s;.

participation of the Prote&s;tant Mini&s;ter in
this di&s;tinction; upon which the Mini&s;ter
received a wax taper from the Cur&eacute;, and
with him led the proce&s;&s;ion. The fire|works
repre&s;ented two trees. One, twi&s;t|ed
and di&s;torted, was emblematical of
ari&s;tocracy, and was &s;oon entirely con|&s;umed;
when a tall &s;traight plant, figura|tive
of patrioti&s;m, appeared to ri&s;e from
the a&s;hes of the former, and continued to
burn with undimini&s;hed &s;plendour.</P>

<P>YESTERDAY I received your let|ter,
in which you accu&s;e me of de&s;crib|ing
with too much enthu&s;ia&s;m the public
rejoicings in France, and prophe&s;y that
I &s;hall return to my own country a fierce
republican. In an&s;wer to the&s;e accu&s;a|tions,
I &s;hall only ob&s;erve, that it is very
difficult, with common &s;en&s;ibility, to avoid
&s;ympathizing in general happine&s;s. My
love of the French revolution, is the na|tural
re&s;ult of this &s;ympathy, and there|fore
my political creed is entirely an af|fair
of the heart; for I have not been &s;o
ab&s;urd as to con&s;ult my head upon mat|ters
of which it is &s;o incapable of judging.
If I were at Rome, you would not be &s;ur|prized
to hear that I had vi&s;ited, with the
warme&s;t reverence, every &s;pot where any
<PB N="67" REF="69">
relics of her ancient grandeur could be
traced; that I had flown to the capitol,
that I had ki&s;&s;ed the earth on which the
Roman &s;enate &s;at in council: And can you
then expect me to have &s;een the Federa|tion
at the Champ de Mars, and the Na|tional
A&s;&s;embly of France, with indiffe|rence?
Before you in&s;i&s;t that I ought to
have done &s;o, point out to me, in the
page of Roman hi&s;tory, a &s;pectacle more
&s;olemn, more affecting, than the Champ
de Mars exhibited, or more magnani|mous,
more noble efforts in the cau&s;e of
liberty than have been made by the Na|tional
A&s;&s;embly. Whether the new form
of government, e&s;tabli&s;hing in France, be
more or le&s;s perfect than our own,
<Q><L>&startq;Who &s;hall decide, when doctors di&s;agree,</L>
<L>And &s;ounde&s;t ca&s;ui&s;ts doubt, like you and me?&endq;</L></Q>
I fancy we had better leave the determi|nation
of this que&s;tion in the hands of
po&s;terity. In the mean time, I wi&s;h that
<PB N="68" REF="70">
&s;ome of our political critics would &s;peak
with le&s;s contempt, than they are apt to do,
of the new con&s;titution of France, and
no longer repeat after one another the trite
remark, that the French have gone too
far, becau&s;e they have gone farther than
our&s;elves; as if it were not po&s;&s;ible that
that degree of influence which is perfectly
&s;afe in the hand of the executive part of
our government, might be dangerous, at
this cri&s;is, to the liberty of France. But
be this as it may, it appears evident that
the temple of Freedom which they are
erecting, even if imperfect in &s;ome of its
proportions, mu&s;t be preferable to the
old gloomy Gothic fabric which they have
laid in ruins. And therefore, when I hear
my good countrymen, who guard their
own rights with &s;uch unremitting vigi|lance,
and who would rather part with

honourable traders of our commercial
country act with the mo&s;t liberal &s;pirit in
their ordinary dealings with other nations,
they wi&s;h to make a monopoly of liberty,
and are angry that France &s;hould claim
a &s;hare of that precious property; by

The French, on the contrary, &s;eem to

the &s;tronge&s;t &s;entiments of re&s;pect

of durable materials or not, I leave
to politicians to determine; but it re|quires
no extraordinary &s;agacity to pro|nounce,
that the French will henceforth
be free. The love of liberty has per|vaded
all ranks of the people, who, if its

it&s;elf, not merely on the days of &s;olemn

deliberation&mdash;but is mingled with
the gaiety of &s;ocial enjoyment. When
they conver&s;e, liberty is the theme of di&s;|cour&s;e;
when they dance, the figure of
the cotillon is adapted to a national
tune; and when they &s;ing, it is but to
repeat a vow of fidelity to the con&s;titu|tion,
at which all who are pre&s;ent in|&s;tantly

with &s;words of &s;harpne&s;s.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, liberty appears in
France adorned with the fre&s;hne&s;s of
youth, and is loved with the ardour of
pa&s;&s;ion. In England &s;he is &s;een in her

<HEAD>LETTER X.</HEAD>
<P>WE have been driving at a furious rate,
for &s;everal days pa&s;t, through the city of
Paris, which I think bears the &s;ame re|&s;emblance
to London (if you will allow
me the indulgence of a &s;imile) that the
grand natural objects in a rude and bar|ren
country bear to the tame but regular
beauties of a &s;cene rich with cultivation.
The &s;treets of Paris are narrow, dark, and
dirty; but we are repaid for this by noble
edifices, which powerfully intere&s;t the at|tention.
The &s;treets of London are broad,
airy, light, and elegant; but I need not
tell you that they lead &s;carcely to any
edifices at which foreigners do not look
with contempt. London has, therefore,
mo&s;t of the beautiful, and Paris of the
&s;ublime, according to Mr. Burke's defi|nition
<PB N="74" REF="76">
of the&s;e qualities; for I a&s;&s;ure you
a &s;en&s;ation of terror is not wanting to the
&s;ublimity of Paris, while the coachman
drives through the &s;treets with the impe|tuo&s;ity
of a Frenchman, and one expects
every &s;tep the hor&s;es take will be fatal to
the foot-pa&s;&s;engers, who are heard ex|claiming,
<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">That the &s;treets of Paris are ari&s;tocrates.</NOTE> &startq;Que les rues de Paris &s;ont
ari&s;tocrates.&endq; By the way, <HI>ari&s;tocracie,</HI>
and <HI>&agrave; la nation,</HI> are become cant terms,
which, as <HI>Sterne</HI> &s;aid of <HI>tant pis,</HI> and <HI>tant

the great hinges in French conver&s;ation.
Every thing tire&s;ome or unplea&s;ant, &startq;c'e&s;t
une ari&s;tocracie!&endq; and every thing charm|ing
and agreeable is, &startq;&agrave; la nation.&endq;</P>
<P>I have &s;een all the fine buildings at
Paris, and fancy I &s;hould have admired
the fa&ccedil;ade of the Louvre, the beautiful
new church of St. Genevieve, and &s;ome
other edifices, even if I had not been
<PB N="75" REF="77">
told previou&s;ly, by a connoi&s;&s;eur in the&s;e
matters, the preci&s;e degree of admiration
which it was proper to be&s;tow on every
public building in Paris: but, having re|ceived
&s;uch minute in&s;tructions on this
&s;ubject, I can form but an imperfect no|tion
of my own ta&s;te for architecture.</P>
<P>At the reque&s;t of Madame Brulart,
Mon&s;. de Chartres &s;ent orders for our ad|mi&s;&s;ion
to the Palais Royal, which is not
at pre&s;ent &s;hewn to the public. Of the
collection of pictures I am incapable of
&s;aying any thing, and enough has been
already &s;aid by tho&s;e who under&s;tand its
merits. Fine painting gives me con|&s;iderable
plea&s;ure, but has not the power
of calling forth my &s;en&s;ibility like fine
poetry; and I am willing to believe that
the art I love is the mo&s;t perfect of the
two; and that it would have been impo&s;|&s;ible
for the pencil of Raphael to convey
all tho&s;e ideas to the mind, and excite all
<PB N="76" REF="78">
tho&s;e emotions in the heart, which are
awakened by the pen of Shake&s;peare.</P>
<P>I confe&s;s, the only picture in Paris which
has co&s;t me any tears, is that of La Val|liere,
in the convent of the Carmelites.
She is repre&s;ented in the habit of a Car|melite;
all the former ornaments of her
per&s;on lie &s;cattered at her feet; and her
eyes are ca&s;t up to Heaven with a look of
the deepe&s;t angui&s;h. While I gazed at
her picture, I lamented that &s;en&s;ibility
which led into the mo&s;t fatal errors a mind
that &s;eems to have been formed for virtue,
and which, even in the bo&s;om of plea&s;ure,
bewailed its own weakne&s;s. How can
one forbear regretting, that the capri|cious
incon&s;tant monarch, to whom &s;he
gave her heart, &s;hould have in&s;pired a
pa&s;&s;ion of which he was &s;o unworthy;
a pa&s;&s;ion which appears to have been
wholly unmixed with intere&s;t, vanity, or
ambition? And how can one avoid pity|ing
<PB N="77" REF="79">
the de&s;olate penitent, who, for &s;o many
years, in the di&s;mal gloom of a convent,
deplored her errors, and felt at once the
bitterne&s;s of remor&s;e, and the agony of
di&s;appointed love? while, probably,
<Q><L>&startq;In every hymn &s;he &s;eem'd his voice to hear,</L>
<L>And dropt with every bead, too &s;oft a tear!&endq;</L></Q></P>
<P>If the figure of this beautiful Carmel|ite
had not come acro&s;s my imagination,
I &s;hould have told you &s;ooner, that the
Palais Royal is a &s;quare, of which the
Duc de Orleans's palace forms one &s;ide.
You walk under piazzas round this &s;quare,
which is &s;urrounded with coffee-hou&s;es,
and &s;hops di&s;playing a variety of ribbons,
trinkets, and caricature prints, which are
now as common at Paris as at London.
The walks under the piazzas are crouded
with people: and in the upper part of the
&s;quare, tents are placed, where coffee, le|monade,
ices, &amp;c. are &s;old. Nothing is
heard but the voice of mirth; nothing is
&s;een but chearful faces; and I have no
<PB N="78" REF="80">
doubt that the Palais Royal is, upon the
whole, one of the merrie&s;t &s;cenes under
the &s;un. Indeed, what is mo&s;t &s;triking
to a &s;tranger at Paris, is that general ap|pearance
of gaiety, which it is ea&s;y to per|ceive
is not a&s;&s;umed for the moment, but
is the habit of the mind, and which is,
therefore, &s;o exhilarating to a &s;pectator of
any benevolence. It is this which gives
&s;uch a charm to every public place and
walk in Paris. Ken&s;ington Gardens can
boa&s;t as fine verdure, as maje&s;tic trees,
as noble walks, and perhaps more beau|tiful
women than the gardens of the
Tuilleries; but we &s;hall look in vain for
that &s;prightly animation, that everla&s;ting
chearfulne&s;s, which render the Tuilleries
&s;o enchanting.</P>
<P>We have ju&s;t returned from the Ho|pital
des Invalides, a noble building, a|dorned
with fine paintings which record
the hi&s;tory of &s;ome celebrated &s;aints,
who&s;e exploits were recounted with in|credible
<PB N="79" REF="81">
rapidity by the man who con|ducted
us through the chapels, and who
&s;eemed to think that nothing could be
more ab&s;urd than our curio&s;ity, after ha|ving
heard the&s;e &s;tories from his lips, to
ob&s;erve how they were told by the pain|ters.</P>
<P>As we pa&s;&s;ed through the church, we
&s;aw &s;everal old &s;oldiers kneeling at the
confe&s;&s;ionals, with that &s;olemn devotion
which &s;eemed undi&s;turbed by our intru|&s;ion,
and fixed upon &startq;the things that are
above.&endq;</P>
<P>A few days before the taking of the
Ba&s;tille, a croud of the Pari&s;ians a&s;&s;em|bled
at the Hopital des Invalides, and
demanded arms of the old &s;oldiers; who
an&s;wered, that they were the friends of
their fellow citizens, but dur&s;t not deliver
up their arms without the appearance of
a conte&s;t; and therefore de&s;ired that the
people would a&s;&s;emble before the gates
in greater numbers the next day, when,
<PB N="80" REF="82">
after firing a little powder upon them,
they would throw down their arms. The
people accordingly returned the following
day; and the invalids, after a faint &s;hew
of re&s;i&s;tance, threw down their arms, which
the citizens took up, embraced the old
men, and then departed.</P>
<P>We &s;topped ye&s;terday at La Mai&s;on
de Ville, and went into a large apartment
where the mayor and corporation a&s;&s;em|ble.
The walls are hung round with pic|tures
of Kings and Dukes, which I looked
at with much le&s;s re&s;pect than at the chair
on which Mon&s;. Bailly &s;its. If his pic|tures
&s;hould ever be placed in this apart|ment,
I fancy that, in the e&s;timation of
po&s;terity, it will obtain precedency over
all the Princes in the collection.</P>
<P>As we came out of La Mai&s;on de
Ville, we were &s;hewn, immediately op|po&s;ite,
the far-famed<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">The lamp-iron.</NOTE> lanterne, at which,
for want of a gallows, the fir&s;t victims
<PB N="81" REF="83">
of popular fury were &s;acrificed. I own
that the &s;ight of La Lanterne chilled the
blood within my veins. At that mo|ment,
for the fir&s;t time, I lamented the
revolution; and, forgetting the impru|dence,
or the guilt, of tho&s;e unfortunate
men, could only reflect with horror on
the dreadful expiation they had made. I
painted in my imagination the agonies of
their families and friends, nor could I for
a con&s;iderable time cha&s;e the&s;e gloomy
images from my thoughts.</P>
<P>It is for ever to be regretted, that &s;o
dark a &s;hade of ferocious revenge was
thrown acro&s;s the glories of the revolu|tion.
But, alas! where do the records of
hi&s;tory point out a revolution un&s;tained
by &s;ome actions of barbarity? When do
the pa&s;&s;ions of human nature ri&s;e to that
pitch which produces great events, with|out
wandering into &s;ome irregularities?
If the French revolution &s;hould co&s;t no
farther blood&s;hed, it mu&s;t be allowed,
<PB N="82" REF="84">
notwith&s;tanding a few &s;hocking in&s;tances
of public vengeance, that the liberty of
twenty-four millions of people will have
been purcha&s;ed at a far cheaper rate than
could ever have been expected from the
former experience of the world.</P>

<P>WE are ju&s;t returned from Ver&s;ailles,
where I could not help fancying I &s;aw, in
the back ground of that magnificent
abode of a de&s;pot, the gloomy dungeons
of the Ba&s;tille, which &s;till haunt my ima|gination,
and prevented my being much
dazzled by the &s;plendour of this &s;uperb

<P>We were &s;hewn the pa&s;&s;ages through
which the Queen e&s;caped from her own

night when the <HI>Poi&s;&s;ardes</HI> vi&s;ited Ver|&s;ailles,
and al&s;o the balcony at which &s;he
&s;tood with the Dauphin in her arms, when,
after having remained a few hours con|cealed
in &s;ome &s;ecret rece&s;s of the pa|lace,
it was thought proper to comply
with the de&s;ire of the croud, who re|peatedly
<PB N="84" REF="86">
demanded her pre&s;ence. I could
not help moralizing a little, on being told
that the apartment to which this balcony
belongs, is the very room in which Louis
the Fourteenth died; little &s;u&s;pecting
what a &s;cene would, in the cour&s;e of a
few years, be acted on that &s;pot.</P>
<P>All the bread which could be procured
in the town of Ver&s;ailles, was di&s;tributed
among the <HI>Poi&s;&s;ardes;</HI> who, with &s;avage
ferocity, held up their mor&s;els of bread

where the Queen &s;tood, crying, in
a tone of defiance,<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">We now have bread.</NOTE> &startq;Nous avons du

<P>During the whole of the journey from
Ver&s;ailles to Paris, the Queen held the

engaging child, and I have ju&s;t heard one

of animals, which he feeds with
his own hand. A few days ago, an un|grateful

<P>While we were &s;itting, after dinner, at
the inn at Ver&s;ailles, the door was &s;ud|denly
opened, and a Franci&s;can friar en|tered
the room. He had &s;o &s;trong a re|&s;emblance
to Sterne's monk, that I am
per&s;uaded he mu&s;t be a de&s;cendant of

<P>I am ju&s;t returned from &s;eeing the
Gobelin tape&s;try, which appears the work

two pictures of Henry the Fourth. In
one, he is placed at &s;upper with the mil|ler's
family; and in the other, he is em|bracing
Sully, who is brought forward on
a couch, after having been wounded in
<PB N="93" REF="95">
battle. Nothing has afforded me more
delight, &s;ince I came to France, than the
honours which are paid to my favourite
hero, Henry the Fourth, whom I prefer
to all the Alexanders and Frederics that
ever exi&s;ted. They may be terribly &s;ub|lime,
if you will, and have great claims
to my admiration; but as for my love,
all that portion of it which I be&s;tow on
heroes, is already in Henry's po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Little &s;tatues of Henry the Fourth and
Sully are very common. Sully is repre|&s;ented
kneeling at the feet of this amiable
Prince, who holds out his hand to him;
and on the ba&s;e of the &s;tatue, are written
the words which Sully records in his Me|moirs:

with national ribbon, that of Louis
the Fourteenth, in the Place Victoire, is
&s;tripped of its former o&s;tentatious orna|ments;

enchained at his feet, having been remov|ed
&s;ince the revolution. The figure of
Fame is, however, &s;till left hovering be|hind
the &s;tatue of the King, with a crown
of laurel in her hand, which, it is gene|rally

his head. But I have heard of a French
wit, who enquired whether it was really
her intention to place the laurel on his
Maje&s;ty's head, or whether &s;he had ju&s;t
taken it off.</P>

<P>WE had a mo&s;t agreeable journey from
Paris to Rouen, travelling a hundred miles
along the borders of the Seine, through a
beautiful country, richly wooded, and finely
diver&s;ified by hill and valley. We pa&s;&s;ed
&s;everal magnificent chateaus, and &s;aw many
a &s;pire belonging to Gothic edifices, which,
it would &s;eem, were built of &s;uch la&s;ting
materials, with the moral purpo&s;e of lead|ing
the mind to reflect on the compara|tively
&s;hort duration of human life. Fre|quently
an old venerable cro&s;s, placed at
the &s;ide of the road by the piety of remote
ages, and never pa&s;&s;ed by Roman Catho|lics
without &s;ome mark of re&s;pect, throws
a kind of religious &s;anctity over the land|&s;cape.</P>
<P>We &s;topped to look at the immen&s;e
<PB N="97" REF="99">
machine which conveys water to Ver&s;ailles
and Marly. The water is rai&s;ed, by
means of this machine, &s;ixty feet, and is
carried the di&s;tance of five hundred. I
never heard a &s;ound which filled my mind
with more horror than the noi&s;e occa&s;ion|ed
by the movements of this tremendous
machine; while, at the &s;ame time, the
va&s;t cha&s;ms, where the water foams with
angry violence, make the brain giddy,
and I was glad to leave the&s;e images of
terror.</P>
<P>Part of our journey was performed by
moon-light, which &s;lept mo&s;t &s;weetly upon

<P>We pa&s;&s;ed the chateau of Ro&s;ni, a

which reflects equal honour on the

About three leagues from Rouen &s;tands
a convent, of which Abelard was for &s;ome

On our way to Rouen we &s;lept at Gal|lon,
a town about five leagues di&s;tant.
Our inn was clo&s;e to the ca&s;tle, which for|merly
belonged to the Archbi&s;hop of
Rouen, and which is now the property of
the nation. The ca&s;tle is a venerable
gothic building, with a fine orangery, and
parks which extend &s;everal leagues. The
Archbi&s;hop, who is the Cardinal de la
Rochefoucault, brother to that di&s;tin|gui&s;hed
patriot the ci devant Duc de la
Rochefoucault, has lo&s;t a very con&s;idera|ble
revenue &s;ince the revolution. He
had an immen&s;e train of &s;ervants, whom
it is &s;aid he di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, upon the dimi|nution

gentlene&s;s, giving hor&s;es to one, a carriage
to another, and endeavouring to be&s;tow
on all &s;ome little alleviation of the pain
they felt at quitting &s;o good a ma&s;ter.
It is impo&s;&s;ible not to regret that the
property of the Cardinal de la Rochefou|cault

employed in di&s;pen&s;ing happine&s;s.</P>
<P>After vi&s;iting the ca&s;tle, I returned
&s;omewhat in mournful mood to the
inn, where there was nothing calcula|ted
to convey one chearful idea. The
cieling of our apartment was cro&s;&s;ed with
old bare beams; the tape&s;try, with which
the room was hung, di&s;played, like the
dre&s;s of Otway's old woman, &startq;variety
of wretchedne&s;s;&endq; the canopied beds
were of coar&s;e dirty &s;tuff; two pictures,
in tawdry gilt frames, &s;landered the &s;weet
countenances of the Dauphin and Ma|dame;
and the floor was paved with
brick. In &s;hort, one can &s;carcely imagine
a &s;cene more remote from England, in
accommodation and comfort, than the
country inns of France: yet, in this ha|bitation,

my re&s;t di&s;turbed half the night by the

<PB N="103" REF="105">
in one of the&s;e niches, with the infant in

<P>Rouen is &s;urrounded by fine boule|vards,
that form very beautiful walks.
On the top of the hill of S^t^e Catharine,
which overlooks the town, are the ruins
of a fort called St. Michell, from which
Henry the Fourth be&s;ieged Rouen. I
love to be put in mind of Henry the
Fourth, and am therefore very well plea&s;ed,
that whenever I go to walk, I can fix my
eyes on the hill of S^t^e Catharine.</P>
<P>I always feel a little a&s;hamed of my

Maid of Orleans was executed, and on

which her &s;tatue &s;tands, a monument of
our di&s;grace. The a&s;hes of her per&s;ecu|tor,
John Duke of Bedford, repo&s;e at no

marble, in the cathedral, which was built
by the Engli&s;h. One cannot feel much

in chu&s;ing, of all places under the &s;un, the
cathedral of Rouen for the tomb of him
who&s;e name is tran&s;mitted to us with the

&s;hade over the <HI>good</HI> Duke's vir|tues.</P>
<P>The cathedral is a very magnificent
edifice, and the great bell is ten feet high,
and weighs thirty-&s;ix thou&s;and pounds.
But in France it is not what is <HI>antient,</HI>
but what is <HI>modern,</HI> that mo&s;t powerfully

<P>A people ju&s;t delivered from the yoke

to clo&s;e again tho&s;e gloomy

<PB N="106" REF="108">

them&s;elves to be once more guided by

<P>A very con&s;iderable number, even
among the nobility of France, have had
the virtue to &s;upport the cau&s;e of free|dom;
and, forgetting the little con&s;idera|tions
of vanity, which have &s;ome impor|tance
in the ordinary cour&s;e of human
affairs, but which are lo&s;t and annihilated
when the mind is animated by any great
&s;entiment, they have cho&s;en to become
the benefactors rather than the oppre&s;&s;ors
of their country; the citizens of a free
&s;tate, in&s;tead of the &s;laves of a de&s;potic
monarch. They will no longer bear
arms to gratify the ambition, or the ca|price
of a mini&s;ter; they will no longer
exert that impetuous and gallant &s;pirit, for
which they have ever been di&s;tingui&s;hed,
in any cau&s;e unworthy of its efforts. The
<PB N="107" REF="109">
fire of valour, which they have too often
employed for the purpo&s;es of de&s;truction,
will henceforth be directed to more ge|nerous
ends. They will chu&s;e another path
to renown. In&s;tead of attempting to take
the citadel of glory by &s;torm, they will
prefer the fame of an honourable defence,
and, renouncing the &s;anguinary laurel,
&s;trive, with more exalted enthu&s;ia&s;m, to
obtain the civic wreath. Yes, the French
nation will inviolably guard, will tran&s;mit
to po&s;terity the &s;acred rights of freedom.
Future ages will celebrate, with grateful
commemoration, the fourteenth of July;
and &s;trangers, when they vi&s;it France, will
ha&s;ten with impatience to the Champ de
Mars, filled with that enthu&s;ia&s;m which is
awakened by the view of a place where
any great &s;cene has been acted. I think
I hear them exclaim, &startq;Here the Fede|ration

<P>But the&s;e meditations have led me to
travel through the &s;pace of &s;o many cen|turies,

me not a little, by informing me of the
war between the Turks and the Ru&s;&s;ians,
at a time when all the people of Europe,
except my&s;elf, had been two years in po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion
of this intelligence?</P>
<P>If, however, my love of the French re|volution

of tyranny, and you will rejoice
with me that tyranny is no more.</P>
<P>Before I clo&s;e my letter, I &s;hall mention
a &s;ingular privilege of the church of
Rouen, which is the power of &s;etting free
a murderer every year on the day of A&s;|cen&s;ion.
It &s;eems that in the time of
King Dagobert, who reigned in the &s;ixth
century, a horrible and unrelenting dra|gon
de&s;olated the country, &s;paring neither
man nor bea&s;t. St. Romain, who was
then Bi&s;hop of Rouen, a&s;ked for two cri|minals
to a&s;&s;i&s;t him in an enterprize he
had the courage to meditate again&s;t the
dragon; and with the&s;e aides de camp he
&s;allied forth, killed the mon&s;ter, and deli|vered
the country. In con&s;equence of
this miracle, Dagobert gave the &s;ucce&s;&s;ors
of St. Romain the privilege of &s;etting a
murderer free every year on A&s;cen&s;ion|day.
<PB N="110" REF="112">
The bones of St. Romain are car|ried
by the criminal in a gilt box through
the &s;treets: the figure of a hideous ani|mal
repre&s;enting the dragon, though it is
&s;u&s;pected of &s;landering his countenance,
accompanies the&s;e venerable bones, and
has generally a young living wolf placed
in its maw, except when it is<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Fa&s;t-day.</NOTE> jour mai|gre,
and then the dragon is provided with
a large fi&s;h. The coun&s;ellors of the parlia|ment,
dre&s;&s;ed in their &s;carlet robes, attend
this proce&s;&s;ion to a church, where high
ma&s;s is &s;aid; and, the&s;e ceremonies being
performed, the criminal is &s;et at liberty.
But it is only when there are &s;ome &s;trong
alleviating circum&s;tances in the ca&s;e of the
offender, that he is &s;uffered in this manner
to evade the puni&s;hment of his crimes.</P>
<P>Ye&s;terday, in a little town called Sotte

<P>We have been at &s;everal convents at

a young nun on the other. I could not

for where can a young woman appear &s;o

remove? What is there, in all the o&s;ten|tation

of the world and all its plea&s;ures?
We made an apology to the nun for our
intru&s;ion, and &s;he directed us to another
apartment, where, a few minutes after we
had &s;eated our&s;elves on one &s;ide of the
grate, La Depo&s;itaire entered on the
other, and told us that the Abbe&s;s, whom
we had de&s;ired to &s;ee, was not yet ri&s;en
from dinner, and La Depo&s;itaire hoped
<PB N="115" REF="117">
we would wait a little.<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Becau&s;e, &s;aid &s;he, the Abbe&s;s was obliged to ri&s;e from table very &s;oon ye&s;terday, and found her&s;elf a little indi&s;po&s;ed.</NOTE> &startq;Parceque,&endq;
&s;aid &s;he, &startq;Madame l'Abbe&s;&s;e etoit obli|g&eacute;e
hier de &s;e lever de table de bonne
heure, et elle &s;e trouvoit une peu incom|mod&eacute;e.&endq;
You mu&s;t ob&s;erve that the
Abbe&s;&s;e dined at three o'clock, and it was
now pa&s;t &s;ix. At length this lady, who
was &s;o fond of long dinners, appeared.
She is a woman of fifty, but is &s;till hand|&s;ome;
has a frank agreeable countenance,
fine eyes, and had put on her veil in a
very becoming manner. We wi&s;hed to
be admitted to the interior part of the
convent, and with this view a French
gentleman, who was of our party,<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Told a great many fables to the Abbe&s;s.</NOTE> &startq;&s;e
mit &agrave; conter des hi&s;toires &agrave; Madame

<P>He told her that my &s;i&s;ter and I, though
Engli&s;h women, were catholics, and wi&s;hed
<PB N="116" REF="118">
to be received into the convent, and even,
if it had been po&s;&s;ible, to take the vows.
The Abbe&s;s enquired if he was quite &s;ure
of our being catholics; upon which the
gentleman, a little puzzled what to an|$wer,
in&s;inuated that Mon&s;. du F&mdash;had
probably the merit of our conver&s;ion.
&startq;But I have heard,&endq; &s;aid the Abbe&s;s,
&startq;from Madame&mdash;, that Mon&s;. du
F&mdash;has become a prote&s;tant him&s;elf.&endq;
Mon&s;. du F&mdash;, who is truth it&s;elf,
av$$ed his principles without he&s;itation;
while the Abbe&s;s, turning to La Depo&s;i|taire,
exclaimed,<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">How amiable he is! what noble &s;entiments! Ah, Sir, you are too good for God to leave you in error.</NOTE> &startq;Mais comme Mon&s;.

Augu&s;tin: my&s;elf, and all my communi|ty,
<PB N="117" REF="119">

Depo&s;itaire, who was a tall thin old wo|man,
with a &s;harp malignant countenance,
added, ca&s;ting a look on Mon&s;. du F&mdash;full
of the contempt of &s;uperior know|ledge,
&startq;It is not &s;urprizing that a young
man, after pa&s;&s;ing &s;everal years in Eng|land,
$word$ country of heretics, &s;hould find
his faith &s;omewhat &s;haken; but he only
wants to be enlightened by Mon&s;. le Cur&eacute;
de&mdash;, who will immediately di&s;&s;ipate
all his doubts.&endq;</P>
<P>From the Convent of the Benedictines
we went to that of the Carmelites, where
religion, which was meant to be a &s;ource
of happine&s;s in this world, as well as in
the next, wears an a&s;pect of the mo&s;t
gloomy horror. When we entered the
convent, it &s;eemed the re&s;idence of &s;ilence
and &s;olitude: no voice was heard, no hu|man
creature appeared; and when we
rang the bell, a per&s;on, whom we could
not &s;ee, enquired, through a hole in the
<PB N="118" REF="120">
wall, what we wanted. On being in|formed
that we wi&s;hed to &s;peak to the Su|perieure,
putting her hand through the
hole, &s;he gave us a key, and de&s;ired us
to unlock the door of the parloir. This
we accordingly did; and in a few minutes
the Superieure came to a thick double
grate, with a curtain drawn at the in&s;ide,
to prevent the po&s;&s;ibility of being &s;een.
Our French gentleman again talked of
our de&s;ire to enter the convent, and beg|ged
to know the rules. A hollow voice
an&s;wered, that the Carmelites ro&s;e at four
in the morning in &s;ummer, and five in
the winter:&mdash;&startq;Obedient &s;lumbers, that
can wake and weep!&endq;&mdash;That they &s;lept
in their coffins, upon &s;traw, and every
morning dug a &s;hovel-full of earth for
their graves; that they walked to their
devotional exerci&s;es upon their knees;
that when any of their friends vi&s;ited them,
if they &s;poke, they were not &s;uffered to be
&s;een, or if they were &s;een, they were not
<PB N="119" REF="121">
&s;uffered to &s;peak; that with them it was
<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Always a fa&s;t.</NOTE> toujours maigre, and they only ta&s;ted
food twice a day.</P>
<P>Our Frenchman &s;aid, &startq;<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">The&s;e young ladies, Madam, mu&s;t con&s;ider whether the&s;e regulations will &s;uit them.</NOTE> Il faut Ma|dame
que &s;es demoi&s;elles reflechi&s;&s;ent, &s;i
cela leurs convient.&endq; The poor Carme|lite
agreed that the matter required &s;ome
reflection, and we departed.</P>
<P>As we returned home meditating on the
lot of a Carmelite, we met in the &s;treet
three nuns walking in the habit of their
order. Upon enquiry, we were told that
they had been forced by their parents to
take the veil, and, &s;ince the decree of the
National A&s;&s;embly giving them liberty,
they had obtained permi&s;&s;ion to pay a vi|&s;it
for three months to &s;ome friends who
&s;ympathized in their unhappine&s;s, and
were now on their journey.</P>
<P>The monks and nuns mu&s;t in a &s;hort
<PB N="120" REF="122">
time decide whether they will finally leave
their cloi&s;ters or not; and the religious
hou&s;es which are vacated will be &s;old. In
the department of Rouen a calculation
has been made, that, after paying every
monk &s;even hundred, and every nun five
hundred livres a year, out of the revenues
of the religious hou&s;es, the department
will gain &s;ixty thou&s;and livres a year. The
monks and nuns above &s;ixty years of age,
who chu&s;e to leave their convents, will be
allowed an annual pen&s;ion of nine hun|dred
livres.</P>
<P>A letter was read in the National A&s;|&s;embly,
a few days ago, from a prie&s;t, in|treating
that the clergy might have per|mi&s;&s;ion
to marry; a privilege which it is
thought the A&s;&s;embly will &s;oon autho|rize.

during our &s;tay at Rouen, the tomb of
William the Conqueror, who is buried at

<P>Upon Mon&s;. du F&mdash;'s arrival at the

<HEAD>LETTER XVI.</HEAD>
<P>I Embrace the fir&s;t hours of lei&s;ure, which
I have found &s;ince my arrival at the
chateau, to &s;end you the hi&s;tory of my
friends.</P>
<P>Antoine Augu&s;tin Thom&aacute;s du F&mdash;,
elde&s;t &s;on of the Baron du F&mdash;, Coun|&s;ellor
of the Parliament of Normandy,
was born on the fifteenth of July, 1750.
His early years were embittered by the
&s;everity of his father, who was of a di&s;po|&s;ition
that preferred the exerci&s;e of do|me&s;tic
tyranny to the ble&s;&s;ings of &s;ocial
happine&s;s, and cho&s;e rather to be dreaded
than beloved. The endearing name of
father conveyed no tran&s;port to <HI>his</HI> heart,
which, being wrapt up in &s;tern in&s;en&s;ibi|lity,
was cold even to the common feel|ings
of nature.</P>
<P><PB N="124" REF="126">
The Baron's au&s;terity was not indeed
confined to his &s;on, but extended to all
his dependants. Formed by nature for
the &s;upport of the antient government of
France, he maintained his ari&s;tocratic
rights with unrelenting &s;everity, ruled his
feudal tenures with a rod of iron, and con|&s;idered
the lower order of people as a &s;et
of beings who&s;e exi&s;tence was tolerated
merely for the u&s;e of the nobility. The
poor, he believed, were only born for &s;uf|fering;
and he determined, as far as in
him lay, not to deprive them of their na|tural
inheritance. On the whole, if it
were the great purpo&s;e of human life to
be hated, perhaps no per&s;on ever attained
that end more completely than the Baron
Du F&mdash;.</P>
<P>His &s;on di&s;covered early a ta&s;te for li|terature,
and received an education &s;uit|able
to his rank and fortune. As he ad|vanced
in life, the treatment he experi|enced
from his father became more and
<PB N="125" REF="127">
more intolerable to him, as, far from in|heriting
the &s;ame character, he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed
the mo&s;t amiable di&s;po&s;itions, and the
mo&s;t feeling heart.</P>
<P>His mother, feeble alike in mind and
body, &s;ubmitted with the helple&s;sne&s;s, and
almo&s;t with the thoughtle&s;sne&s;s of a child,
to the imperious will of her hu&s;band.
Their family was increa&s;ed by two more
&s;ons, and two daughters; but the&s;e chil|dren,
being &s;everal years younger than
Mon&s;. Du F&mdash;, were not of an age to
afford him the con&s;olations of friend&s;hip;
and the young man would have found
his &s;ituation intolerable, but for the &s;ym|pathy
of a per&s;on, in who&s;e &s;ociety every
evil was forgotten.</P>
<P>This per&s;on, his attachment to whom
has tinctured the colour of his life, was
the younge&s;t of eight children, of a re|&s;pectable
family of Bourgeois at Rouen.
There is great rea&s;on to believe that her
father was de&s;cended from the younger
<PB N="126" REF="128">
branch of a noble family of the &s;ame
name, and bearing the &s;ame arms. But,
unhappily, &s;ome links were wanting in
this chain of honourable parentage. The
claim to nobility could not be traced to
the entire &s;atisfaction of the Baron; who,
though he would have di&s;pen&s;ed with any
moral qualities in favour of rank, con&s;i|dered
ob&s;cure birth as a radical &s;tain,
which could not be wiped off by all the
virtues under heaven. He looked upon
marriage as merely a convention of inte|re&s;t,
and children as a property, of which
it was rea&s;onable for parents to make the
mo&s;t in their power.</P>
<P>The father of Mad^&s;^e^l^l^e^ Monique C&mdash;was
a farmer, and died three months be|fore
the birth of this child; who, with
&s;even other children, was educated with
the utmo&s;t care by their mother, a wo|man
of &s;en&s;e and virtue, beloved by all
to whom &s;he was known. It &s;eemed as
if this re&s;pectable woman had, after the
<PB N="127" REF="129">
death of her hu&s;band, only &s;upported life
for the &s;ake of her infant family, from
whom &s;he was &s;natched by death, the
moment her maternal cares became no
longer nece&s;&s;ary; her younge&s;t daughter,
Monique, having, at this period, ju&s;t at|tained
her twentieth year. Upon the
death of her mother, Monique went to
live with an aunt, with whom &s;he remain|ed
only a very &s;hort time, being invited
by Madame du F&mdash;, to whom &s;he was
well known, to come and live with her
as an humble companion, to read to her
when &s;he was di&s;po&s;ed to li&s;ten, and to
enliven the &s;ullen grandeur of the cha|teau,
by her animating vivacity.</P>
<P>This young per&s;on had cultivated her
excellent under&s;tanding by reading, and
her heart &s;tood in no need of cultivation.
Mon&s;. Du F&mdash;found in the charms of
her conver&s;ation, and in the &s;ympathy of
her friend&s;hip, the mo&s;t &s;oothing con&s;o|lation
under the rigor of parental tyranny.
<PB N="128" REF="130">
Living &s;everal years beneath the &s;ame
roof, he had con&s;tant opportunities of ob|&s;erving
her di&s;po&s;ition and character;
and the pa&s;&s;ion with which &s;he at length
in&s;pired him, was founded on the la&s;ting
ba&s;is of e&s;teem.</P>
<P>If it was ever pardonable to deviate
from that law, in the code of intere&s;t and
etiquette, which forbids the heart to li&s;|ten
to its be&s;t emotions; which, &s;tifling
every generous &s;entiment of pure di&s;inte|re&s;ted
attachment, &s;acrifices love at the
&s;hrine of avarice or ambition; the vir|tues
of Monique were &s;uch as might ex|cu&s;e
this deviation. Yes, the character,
the conduct of this amiable per&s;on, have
nobly ju&s;tified her lover's choice. How
long might he have vainly &s;ought, in the
highe&s;t cla&s;&s;es of &s;ociety, a mind &s;o ele|vated
above the common ma&s;s!&mdash;a mind
that, endowed with the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite &s;en|&s;ibility,
has had &s;ufficient firmne&s;s to &s;u&s;|tain,
with a calm and equal &s;pirit, every
<PB N="129" REF="131">
tran&s;ition of fortune; the mo&s;t &s;evere
trials of adver&s;ity, and perhaps what is
&s;till more difficult to bear, the trial of
high pro&s;perity.</P>
<P>Mon&s;. Du F&mdash;had been taught, by
his early misfortunes, that dome&s;tic hap|pine&s;s
was the fir&s;t good of life. He had
already found, by experience, the in&s;uffi|ciency
of rank and fortune to confer en|joyment;
and he determined to &s;eek it
in the bo&s;om of conjugal felicity. He
determined to pa&s;s his life with her who&s;e
&s;ociety now &s;eemed e&s;&s;ential not only to
his happine&s;s, but to his very exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>At the &s;olemn hour of midnight, the
young couple went to a church, where
they were met by a prie&s;t whom Mon&s;.
Du F&mdash;had made the confident of his
attachment, and by whom the marriage
ceremony was performed.</P>
<P>Some time after, when the &s;ituation of
his wife obliged Mon&s;. Du F&mdash;to ac|knowledge
their marriage to his mother,
<PB N="130" REF="132">
&s;he a&s;&s;ured her &s;on that &s;he would wil|lingly
con&s;ent to receive his wife as her
daughter, but for the dread of his father's
re&s;entment. Madame Du F&mdash;, with
tears of regret, parted with Monique,
whom &s;he placed under the protection of
her brothers: they conducted her to
Caen, where &s;he was &s;oon after delivered
of a &s;on.</P>
<P>The Baron Du F&mdash;was ab&s;ent
while the&s;e things were pa&s;&s;ing: he had
been &s;u&s;pected of being the author of a
pamphlet written again&s;t the princes of
the blood, and an order was i&s;&s;ued to
&s;eize his papers, and conduct him to the
Ba&s;tille; but he found means to e&s;cape
into Holland, where he remained nearly
two years. Having made his peace with
the mini&s;try, he prepared to come home;
but before he returned, Mon&s;. Du F&mdash;received
intelligence that his father, irri|tated
almo&s;t to madne&s;s by the informa|tion
of his marriage, was making appli|cation
<PB N="131" REF="133">
for a lettre de cachet, in order to
confine his daughter-in-law for the re&s;t of
her life; and had al&s;o obtained power to
have his &s;on &s;eized and impri&s;oned.
Upon this Mon&s;. Du F&mdash;and his wife
fled with precipitation to Geneva, leav|ing
their infant at nur&s;e near Gaen. The
Genevois &s;eemed to think that the un|fortunate
&s;ituation of the&s;e &s;trangers, gave
them a claim to all the offices of friend|&s;hip.
After an interval of many years,
I have never heard Mon&s;. or Madame
Du F&mdash;recall the kindne&s;s they re|ceived
from that amiable people, without
tears of tenderne&s;s and gratitude.</P>
<P>Meanwhile the Baron, having di&s;co|vered
the place of his &s;on's retreat, ob|tained,
in the name of the King, permi&s;|&s;ion
from the cantons of Berne and Fri|burg
to arre&s;t them at Lau&s;anne, where
they had retired for &s;ome months. The
wife of Le Seigneur Baillif &s;ecretly gave
the young people notice of this de&s;ign,
<PB N="132" REF="134">
and on the thirtieth of January, 1775,
they had ju&s;t time to make their e&s;cape,
with only a few livres in their pockets,
and the clothes in which they were dre&s;&s;ed.
Mon&s;. Du F&mdash;, upon his fir&s;t going to
Switzerland, had lent thirty louis to a friend
in di&s;tre&s;s. He now, in this moment of
nece&s;&s;ity, de&s;ired to be repaid, and was
promi&s;ed the money within a month:
mean time, he and his wife wandered from
town to town, without finding any place
where they could remain in &s;ecurity.
They had &s;pent all their &s;mall &s;tock of
money, and were almo&s;t without clothes:
but at the expiration of the appointed
time, the thirty louis were paid, and with
this fund Mon&s;. and Madame Du F&mdash;determined
to take &s;helter in the only
country which could afford them a &s;afe
a&s;ylum from per&s;ecution, and immediately
&s;et off for England, travelling through
Germany, and part of Holland, to avoid
pa&s;&s;ing through France.</P>
<P><PB N="133" REF="135">
They embarked at Rotterdam, and,
after a long and gloomy pa&s;&s;age, arrived
late at night at London. A young man,
who was their fellow pa&s;&s;enger, had the
charity to procure them a lodging in a
garret, and directed them where to pur|cha&s;e
a few ready-made clothes. When
they had remained in this lodging the
time nece&s;&s;ary for becoming pari&s;hioners,
their banns were publi&s;hed in the church of
St. Anne, We&s;tmin&s;ter, where they were
married by the Curate of the pari&s;h.
They then went to the chapel of the
French Amba&s;&s;ador, and were again mar|ried
by his Chaplain; after which Mon&s;.
Du F&mdash;told me,<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">The new-married couple kept a fa&s;t in their little apartment.</NOTE> &startq;Les deux epoux
vinrent faire maigre chair &agrave; leur petite

<P>Mon&s;. Du F&mdash;endeavoured to ob|tain
a &s;ituation at a &s;chool, to teach the
French language; but before &s;uch a &s;itua|tion
<PB N="134" REF="136">
could be found, his wife was deli|vered
of a girl. Not having &s;ufficient
money to hire a nur&s;e, he attended her
him&s;elf. At this period they endured all
the horrors of ab&s;olute want. Unknown
and unpitied, without help or &s;upport, in
a foreign country, and in the depth of a
&s;evere winter, they almo&s;t peri&s;hed with
cold and hunger. The unhappy mother
lay &s;tretched upon the &s;ame bed with her
new-born infant, who in vain implored
her &s;uccour, want of food having dried
up that &s;ource of nouri&s;hment. The wo|man,
at who&s;e hou&s;e they lodged, and
whom they had for &s;ome weeks been un|able
to pay, after many threatenings, at
length told them that they mu&s;t depart the
next morning. Madame Du F&mdash;was
at this time &s;carcely able to walk acro&s;s
her chamber, and the ground was covered
with &s;now. They had already exhau&s;ted
every re&s;ource; they had &s;old their
watches, their clothes, to &s;atisfy the crav|ings
<PB N="135" REF="137">
of hunger; every mode of relief was
fled&mdash;every avenue of hope was clo&s;ed&mdash;and
they determined to go with their in|fant
to the &s;uburbs of the town, and there,
&s;eated on a &s;tone, wait with patience for
the deliverance of death. With what an|gui&s;h
did this unfortunate couple pre|pare
to leave their la&s;t mi&s;erable retreat!
With how many bitter tears did they bathe
that wretched infant, whom they could no
longer &s;ave from peri&s;hing!</P>
<P>Oh, my dear, my ever beloved friends!

<P>Mon&s;. and Madame du F&mdash;were
relieved from this extremity of di&s;tre&s;s at
a moment &s;o critical, and by means &s;o
unexpected, that it &s;eemed the hand of
Heaven vi&s;ibly interpo&s;ing in behalf of
oppre&s;&s;ed virtue. Early in the morning
of that fatal day when they were to leave
their la&s;t &s;ad &s;helter, Mon&s;. du F&mdash;went
out, and, in the utmo&s;t di&s;traction of
mind, wandered through &s;ome of the
&s;treets in the neighbourhood. He was
&s;topped by a gentleman whom he had
known at Geneva, and who told him that
<PB N="137" REF="139">
he was then in &s;earch of his lodging, ha|ving
a letter to deliver to him from a
Genevois clergyman. Mon&s;. du F&mdash;opened
the letter, in which he was in|formed
by his friend, that, fearing he
might be involved in difficulties, he had
tran&s;mitted ten guineas to a banker in
London, and intreated Mon&s;. du F&mdash;would
accept that &s;mall relief, which was
all he could afford, as a te&s;timony of friend|&s;hip.
Mon&s;. du F&mdash;flew to the ban|ker's,
received the money as the gift of
Heaven, and then, ha&s;tening to his wife
and child, bade them live a little longer.</P>
<P>A &s;hort time after, he obtained a &s;itu|ation
as French u&s;her at a &s;chool; and
Madame du F&mdash;, when &s;he had a little
recovered her &s;trength, put out her infant
to nur&s;e, and procured the place of
French teacher at a boarding-&s;chool.
They were now enabled to &s;upport their
child, and to repay the generous a&s;&s;i&s;tance
of their kind friend at Geneva. At this
<PB N="138" REF="140">
period they heard of the death of their
&s;on, whom they had left at Caen.</P>
<P>Mon&s;. and Madame du F&mdash;pa&s;&s;ed
two years in this &s;ituation, when they were
again plunged into the deepe&s;t di&s;tre&s;s.
A French jeweller was commi&s;&s;ioned by
the Baron du F&mdash;, to go to his &s;on, and
propo&s;e to him conditions of reconciliation.
This man told Mon&s;. du F&mdash;that his
father was ju&s;t recovered from a &s;evere
and dangerous illne&s;s, and that his elde&s;t
daughter had lately died. The&s;e things,
he &s;aid, had led him to reflect with &s;ome
pain on the &s;everity he had exerci&s;ed to|wards
his &s;on; that the feelings of a pa|rent
were awakened in his bo&s;om; and
that if Mon&s;. du F&mdash;would throw
him&s;elf at his father's feet, and a&s;k for|givene&s;s,
he would not fail to obtain it,
and would be allowed a pen&s;ion, on which
he might live with his wife in England. In
confirmation of the&s;e a&s;&s;urances, this man
produced &s;everal letters which he had re|ceived
<PB N="139" REF="141">
from the Baron to that effect; who,
as a farther proof of his &s;incerity, had given
this agent &s;even hundred pounds to put
into the hands of Mon&s;. du F&mdash;for the
&s;upport of his wife and child during his
ab&s;ence. The agent told him, that he
had not been able to bring the money to
England, but would immediately give
him three drafts upon a merchant of re|putation
in London, with whom he had
connections in bu&s;ine&s;s; the fir&s;t draft
payable in three months, the &s;econd in
&s;ix, and the third in nine.</P>
<P>Mon&s;. du F&mdash;long deliberated upon
the&s;e propo&s;als. He knew too well the
vindictive &s;pirit of his father, not to feel
&s;ome dread of putting him&s;elf into his
power. But his agent continued to give
him the mo&s;t &s;olemn a&s;&s;urances of &s;afety;
and Mon&s;. du F&mdash;thought it was not
improbable that his &s;i&s;ter's death might
have &s;oftened the mind of his father. He
reflected that his marriage had di&s;ap|pointed
<PB N="140" REF="142">
tho&s;e ambitious hopes of a great
alliance, which his father had fondly in|dulged,
and to whom he owed at lea&s;t
the reparation of ha&s;tening to implore his
forgivene&s;s when he was willing to be&s;tow
it. What al&s;o weighed &s;trongly on his
mind was the con&s;ideration that the &s;um
which his father had offered to depo&s;it for
the u&s;e of his wife, would, in ca&s;e any
&s;ini&s;ter accident &s;hould befal him, afford
a &s;mall provi&s;ion for her and his infant.</P>
<P>The re&s;ult of the&s;e deliberations was,
that Mon&s;. du F&mdash;determined (and
who can much blame his want of pru|dence?)
he determined to confide in a
father!&mdash;to tru&s;t in that in&s;tinctive affec|tion,
which, far from being connected
with any peculiar &s;en&s;ibility of mind, it
requires only to be a parent to feel&mdash;an
affection, which, not confined to the hu|man
heart, &s;oftens the ferociou&s;ne&s;s of the
tyger, and &s;peaks with a voice that is
heard amid&s;t the howlings of the de&s;art.</P>
<P><PB N="141" REF="143">
Mon&s;. du F&mdash;, after the repeated pro|mi&s;es
of his father, almo&s;t con&s;idered that
&s;u&s;picion which &s;till hung upon his mind,
as a crime. But, le&s;t it might be po&s;&s;i|ble
that this agent was commi&s;&s;ioned to
deceive him, he endeavoured to melt him
into compa&s;&s;ion for his &s;ituation. He
went to the village where his child was at
nur&s;e, and, bringing her &s;ix miles in his
arms, pre&s;ented her to this man, telling
him, that the fate of that poor infant re&s;ted
upon his integrity. The man took the
innocent creature in his arms, ki&s;&s;ed her,
and then, returning her to her father, re|newed
all his former a&s;&s;urances. Mon&s;.
du F&mdash;li&s;tened and believed. Alas!
how difficult is it for a good heart to &s;u&s;|pect
human nature of crimes which make
one blu&s;h for the &s;pecies! How hard is
it for a mind glowing with benevolence,
to believe that the bo&s;om of another har|bours
the malignity of a demon!</P>
<P>Mon&s;. du F&mdash;now fixed the time
<PB N="142" REF="144">
for his departure with his father's agent,
who was to accompany him to Normandy.
Madame du F&mdash;&s;aw the preparations
for his journey with angui&s;h which &s;he
could ill conceal. But &s;he felt that the
delicacy of her &s;ituation forbad her inter|ference.
It was &s;he who had made him
an alien from his family, and an exile
from his country. It was for her, that, re|nouncing
rank, fortune, friends, and con|nections,
all that is e&s;teemed mo&s;t valua|ble
in life, he had &s;uffered the la&s;t extre|mity
of want, and now &s;ubmitted to a
&s;tate of drudgery and dependance. Would
he not have a right to reproach her weak|ne&s;s,
if &s;he attempted to oppo&s;e his recon|ciliation
with his father, and exerted that
influence which &s;he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed over his
mind, in order to detain him in a &s;itua|tion
&s;o remote from his former expecta|tions?
She was, therefore, &s;en&s;ible, that
the duty, the gratitude &s;he owed her hu&s;|band,
now required on her part the ab|&s;olute
<PB N="143" REF="145">
&s;acrifice of her own feelings: &s;he
&s;uffered without complaint, and endea|voured
to re&s;ign her&s;elf to the will of
Heaven.</P>
<P>The day before his departure, Mon&s;.
du F&mdash;went to take leave of his little
girl. At this moment a dark and melan|choly
pre&s;age &s;eemed to agitate his mind.
He pre&s;&s;ed the child for a long while
to his bo&s;om, and bathed it with his
tears. The nur&s;e eagerly enquired what
was the matter, and a&s;&s;ured him that the
child was perfectly well. Mon&s;. du F&mdash;had
no power to reply: he continued
cla&s;ping his infant in his arms, and at
length, tearing him&s;elf from her in &s;ilence,
he ru&s;hed out of the hou&s;e.</P>
<P>When the morning of his departure
came, Madame du F&mdash;, addre&s;&s;ing
her&s;elf to his fellow-traveller, &s;aid to him,
with a voice of &s;upplication, &startq;I entru&s;t
you, Sir, with my hu&s;band, with the father
of my poor infant, our &s;ole protector and
<PB N="144" REF="146">
&s;upport!&mdash;have compa&s;&s;ion on the widow
and the orphan!&endq; The man, ca&s;ting
upon her a gloomy look, gave her a cold
an&s;wer, which made her &s;oul &s;hrink within
her. When Mon&s;. du F&mdash;got into
the Brighthelm&s;tone &s;tage, he was unable
to bid her farewell; but when the carriage
drove off, he put his head out of the win|dow,
and continued looking after her,
while &s;he fixed her eyes on him, and
might have repeated with Imogen,
<Q><L>&startq;I would have broke mine eye-&s;trings;</L>
<L>Crack'd them, but to look upon him; till the
diminution</L>
<L>Of &s;pace had pointed him &s;harp as my needle;</L>
<L>Nay, followed him, till he had melted from</L>
<L>The &s;mallne&s;s of a gnat to air; and then&mdash;</L>
<L>Then turn'd mine eye and wept!&endq;</L></Q>
When the carriage was out of &s;ight, &s;he
&s;ummoned all her &s;trength, and walked
with trembling &s;teps to the &s;chool where
&s;he lived as a teacher. With much dif|ficulty
<PB N="145" REF="147">
&s;he reached the door; but her
limbs could &s;upport her no longer, and
&s;he fell down &s;en&s;ele&s;s at the thre&s;hold.
She was carried into the hou&s;e, and re|&s;tored
to life and the &s;en&s;ations of mi|&s;ery.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XVIII.</HEAD>
<P>MONS. du F&mdash;arrived at his fa|ther's
chateau in Normandy, in June
1778, and was received by Mon&s;. le
Baron, and all his family, with the mo&s;t
affectionate cordiality. In much exulta|tion
of mind, he di&s;patched a letter to
Madame du F&mdash;, containing this agree|able
intelligence; but his letter was far
from producing in her mind the effect
he de&s;ired. A deep melancholy had &s;eized
her thoughts, and her foreboding heart
refu&s;ed to &s;ympathize in his joy. Short,
indeed, was its duration. He had not
been many days at the chateau, when he
perceived, with &s;urprize and con&s;ternation,
that his &s;teps were continually watched
by two &s;ervants armed with fu&s;ees.</P>
<P>His father now &s;hewed him an arret,
<PB N="147" REF="149">
which, on the fourth of June, 1776, he had
obtained from the parliament of Rouen a|gain&s;t
his marriage. The Baron then or|dered
his &s;on to accompany him to his hou&s;e
at Rouen, whither they went, attended by
&s;everal &s;ervants. That evening, when the
attendants withdrew after &s;upper, the Ba|ron,
entirely throwing off the ma&s;k of civi|lity
and kindne&s;s, which he had worn in
&s;uch oppo&s;ition to his nature, reproached
his &s;on, in terms of the utmo&s;t bitterne&s;s,
for his pa&s;t conduct, inveighed again&s;t his
marriage, and, after having exhau&s;ted
every expre&s;&s;ion of rage and re&s;entment,
at length &s;uffered him to retire to his own
apartment.</P>
<P>There the unhappy Mon&s;. du F&mdash;,
ab&s;orbed in the mo&s;t gloomy reflections,
lamented in vain that fatal credulity which
had led him to put him&s;elf into the power
of his implacable father. At the hour
of midnight his meditations were inter|rupted
by the &s;ound of feet approaching
<PB N="148" REF="150">
his chamber; and in a few moments the
door was thrown open, and his father, at|tended
by a &s;ervant armed, and two<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Officers of ju&s;tice.</NOTE> Ca|valiers
de Marechau&s;&s;&eacute;e, entered the room.
Re&s;i&s;tance and &s;upplication were alike
unavailing. Mon&s;. du F&mdash;'s papers
were &s;eized; a few louis d'ors, which con|&s;tituted
all the money he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, were
taken from him; and he was conducted
in the dead of night, July the 7th, 1778,
to St. Yon, a convent u&s;ed as a place of
confinement near Rouen, where he was
thrown into a dungeon.</P>
<P>A week after, his father entered the
dungeon. You will perhaps conclude that
his hard heart felt at length the relent|ings
of a parent. You will at lea&s;t &s;up|po&s;e,
that his imagination being haunted,
and his con&s;cience tormented with the
image of a &s;on &s;tretched on the floor of
this &s;ubterraneous cell, he could &s;up|port
the idea no longer, and had ha&s;tened
<PB N="149" REF="151">
to give repo&s;e to his own mind by re|lea&s;ing
his captive. Far different were
the motives of his vi&s;it. He con&s;idered
that &s;uch was his &s;on's attachment to his
wife, that, &s;o long as he believed he had
left her in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of &s;even hundred
pounds, he would find comfort from that
con&s;ideration, even in the depth of his
dungeon. His father, therefore, ha&s;tened
to remove an error from the mind of his
&s;on, which left the mea&s;ure of his woes
unfilled. Nor did he chu&s;e to yield to
another the office of inflicting a pang
&s;harper than captivity; but him&s;elf in|formed
his &s;on, that the merchant, who
was to pay the &s;even hundred pounds to
his wife, was declared a bankrupt.</P>
<P>A &s;hort time after, the Baron du F&mdash;commenced
a &s;uit at law again&s;t that
agent of iniquity whom he had employed
to deceive his &s;on, and who, practi&s;ing a
refinement of treachery of which the
Baron was not aware, had kept the &s;even
<PB N="150" REF="152">
hundred pounds, with which he was in|tru&s;ted,
and given drafts upon a mer|chant
who he knew would fail before the
time of payment. Not being able to
pro&s;ecute this affair without a power of
attorney from his &s;on, the Baron applied
to him for that purpo&s;e. But Mon&s;. du
F&mdash;, being firmly re&s;olved not to de|prive
his wife of the chance of recovering
the money for her&s;elf and her child, could
by no intreaties or menaces be led to com|ply.
In vain his father, who had con|&s;ented
to allow him a few books, ordered
him to be deprived of that re&s;ource, and
that his confinement &s;hould be rendered
&s;till more rigorous; he continued inflex|ible.</P>
<P>Mon&s;. du F&mdash;remained in his pri|&s;on
without meeting with the &s;malle&s;t
mark of &s;ympathy from any one of his
family, though his &s;econd brother, Mon&s;.
de B&mdash;, was now eighteen years of
age; an age at which the &s;ordid con&s;ide|rations
<PB N="151" REF="153">
of intere&s;t, how much &s;oever they
may affect our conduct at a more ad|vanced
period of life, can &s;eldom &s;tifle
tho&s;e warm and generous feelings which
&s;eem to belong to youth. It might have
been expected that this young man would
have abhorred the pro&s;pect of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing
a fortune which was the ju&s;t inheritance of
his brother, and which could only be ob|tained
by detaining that brother in per|petual
captivity. Even admitting that
his inexorable father prohibited his vi&s;it|ing
the pri&s;on of his brother, his heart
&s;hould have told him, that di&s;obedience,
in this in&s;tance, would have been virtue:
Or, was it not &s;ufficient to remain a pa&s;&s;ive
&s;pectator of inju&s;tice, without becoming,
as he afterwards did, the agent of cruelty
inflicted on a brother?</P>
<P>Where are the words that can convey
an adequate idea of the &s;ufferings of
Madame du F&mdash;during this period?
Three weeks after her hu&s;band's depar|ture
<PB N="152" REF="154">
from England, &s;he heard the general
report of the town of Rouen, that the
Baron du F&mdash;had obtained a letter de
cachet again&s;t his &s;on, and thrown him
into pri&s;on. This was all &s;he heard of
her hu&s;band for the &s;pace of two years.
Ignorant of the place of his confinement,
uncertain if he &s;till lived, perhaps her mi|&s;eries
were even more poignant than his.
In the di&s;mal &s;olitude of a pri&s;on, his
pains were alleviated by the &s;oothing re|flection
that he &s;uffered for her he loved;
while that very idea was to her the mo&s;t
bitter aggravation of di&s;tre&s;s. Her days
pa&s;&s;ed in angui&s;h, which can only be con|ceived
where it has been felt, and her
nights were di&s;turbed by the gloomy wan|derings
of fancy. Sometimes &s;he &s;aw
him in her dreams chained to the floor of
his dungeon, his bo&s;om bathed in blood,
and his countenance disfigured by death.
Sometimes &s;he &s;aw him ha&s;tening towards
her, when at the moment that he was
<PB N="153" REF="155">
going to embrace her, they were fiercely
torn a&s;under. Madame du F&mdash;was
naturally of a delicate con&s;titution, and
grief of mind reduced her to &s;uch a de|plorable
&s;tate of weakne&s;s, that it was
with infinite difficulty &s;he performed the
duties of her &s;ituation. For her&s;elf, &s;he
would have welcomed death with thank|fulne&s;s;
but &s;he con&s;idered that her child
now depended entirely on her labours
for &s;upport: and this was a motive &s;uf|ficiently
powerful to prompt her to the
careful pre&s;ervation of her own life, though
it had long become a burden. The child
was three years old when her father left
England; recollected him perfectly; and,
whenever her mother went to vi&s;it her,
u&s;ed to call with eagerne&s;s for her papa.
The enquiry, in the voice of her child, of,
&startq;When &s;hall I &s;ee my dear, dear papa?&endq;
was heard by this unhappy mother with
a degree of agony which it were vain in|deed
to de&s;cribe.</P>

<PB N="154" REF="156">
<HEAD>LETTER XIX.</HEAD>
<P>MONS. du F&mdash;was repeatedly of|fered
his liberty, but upon conditions
which he abhorred. He was required
for ever to renounce his wife; who, while
&s;he remained with her child in a di&s;tant
country, was to receive from his father a
&s;mall pen&s;ion, as an equivalent for the
pangs of di&s;appointed affection, of di&s;|grace
and di&s;honour. With the indigna|tion
of offended virtue he &s;purned at the&s;e
in&s;ulting propo&s;itions, and endeavoured
to prepare his mind for the endurance of
perpetual captivity.</P>
<P>Nor can imagination form an idea of a
&s;cene more dreadful than his pri&s;on, where
he perceived with horror that the great|e&s;t
number of tho&s;e pri&s;oners who had
been many years in confinement, had an
<PB N="155" REF="157">
appearance of frenzy in their looks, which
&s;hewed that rea&s;on had been too weak for
the long &s;truggle with calamity, and had
at la&s;t yielded to de&s;pair. In a cell ad|joining
Mon&s;. du F&mdash;'s, was an old man
who had been confined nearly forty years.
His grey beard hung down to his wai&s;t,
and, during the day, he was chained by his
neck to the wall. He was never allowed
to leave his cell, and never &s;poke; but
Mon&s;. du F&mdash;u&s;ed to hear the rattling
of his chains.</P>
<P>The pri&s;oners, a few excepted, were
generally brought from their cells at
the hour of noon, and dined together.
But this gloomy repa&s;t was &s;erved in
uninterrupted &s;ilence. They were not
&s;uffered to utter one word, and the pe|nalty
of tran&s;gre&s;&s;ing this rule was a rigo|rous
confinement of &s;everal weeks. As
&s;oon as this comfortle&s;s meal was fini&s;hed,
the pri&s;oners were in&s;tantly obliged to
return to their dungeons, in which they
<PB N="156" REF="158">
were locked up till the &s;ame hour the
following day. Mon&s;. du F&mdash;, in his
damp and melancholy cell, pa&s;&s;ed two
winters without fire, and &s;uffered &s;o &s;e|verely
from cold, that he was obliged to
wrap him&s;elf up in the few clothes which
covered his bed. Nor was he allowed
any light, except that which during the
&s;hort day beamed through the &s;mall
grated window in the cieling of his dun|geon.</P>
<P>Is it not difficult to believe that the&s;e
&s;ufferings were inflicted by a father?
A father!&mdash;that name which I
cannot trace without emotion; which
conveys all the ideas of protection, of
&s;ecurity, of tenderne&s;s;&mdash;that dear rela|tion
to which, in general, children owe
their pro&s;perity, their enjoyments, and
even their virtues!&mdash;Alas, the unhappy
Mon&s;. du F&mdash;owed nothing to <HI>his</HI>
father, but that life, which from its earlie&s;t
period his cruelty had embittered, and
<PB N="157" REF="159">
which he now condemned to langui&s;h in
mi&s;eries that death only could heal.</P>
<P>A young gentleman, who was confined
in a cell on one &s;ide of Mon&s;. du F&mdash;'s,
contrived to make a &s;mall hole through
the wall; and the&s;e companions in mi&s;|fortune,
by placing them&s;elves clo&s;e to the
hole, could conver&s;e together in whi&s;pers.
But the Monks were not long in di&s;cover|ing
this, and effectually deprived them of
&s;o great an indulgence, by removing them
to di&s;tant cells. The&s;e unrelenting Monks,
who performed with &s;uch fidelity their
office of tormenting their fellow-crea|tures,
who never relaxed in one article of
per&s;ecution, and adhered with &s;crupulous
rigour to the code of cruelty, were called,
<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">The Brothers of the holy Charity.</NOTE> &startq;Les Freres de la &s;ainte Charit&eacute;.&endq; One
among them de&s;erved the appellation.
This good old Monk u&s;ed to vi&s;it the pri|&s;oners
by &s;tealth, and endeavour to ad|mini&s;ter
<PB N="158" REF="160">
comfort to their affliction. Often
he repeated to Mon&s;. du F&mdash;,<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">My dear brother, be comforted; place your confidence in God, your afflictions will have an end.</NOTE> &startq;Mon

<P>Mon&s;. du F&mdash;remained two years
in pri&s;on without receiving any intelli|gence
of his wife, on who&s;e account he
&s;uffered the mo&s;t di&s;tracting anxiety. He
had rea&s;on to apprehend that her frame,
which had already been enfeebled by her
misfortunes, would &s;ink beneath this ad|ditional
load of mi&s;ery, and that &s;he would
perhaps be rendered unable to procure
that little pittance, which might pre&s;erve
her&s;elf and her child from want. At
length one of his fellow-pri&s;oners, who
was going to regain his liberty, took charge
of a letter to Madame du F&mdash;, and
flattered him with the hope of finding
<PB N="159" REF="161">
&s;ome means of tran&s;mitting to him an
an&s;wer.</P>
<P>The letter paints &s;o naturally the &s;itu|ation
of his mind, that I have tran&s;lated
&s;ome extracts from it.</P>
<P>&startq;My thoughts (he &s;ays) are uncea&s;|ingly
occupied about you, and my
dear little girl. I am for ever recall|ing
the ble&s;&s;ed moments when I had
the happine&s;s of being near you, and
at that recollection my tears refu&s;e to
be controuled. How could I con|&s;ent
to &s;eparate my&s;elf from what was
mo&s;t dear to me in the world? No
motive le&s;s powerful than that of &s;eek|ing
your welfare, and that of my child,
could have determined me&mdash;and alas!
I have not accompli&s;hed this end. I
know too well that you have never
received that &s;um of money which I
thought I had &s;ecured for you, and for
which I ri&s;ked the fir&s;t ble&s;&s;ing of life.
What fills my mind with the greate&s;t
<PB N="160" REF="162">
horror, in the &s;olitude of my pri&s;on, is
the fear that you are &s;uffering difficul|ties
in a foreign country. Here I re|main
ignorant of your fate, and can
only offer to Heaven the mo&s;t ardent
vows for your welfare.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;What joy would a letter from you
give me! but I dare not flatter my&s;elf
with the hope of &s;uch &s;weet con&s;ola|tion.
All I can a&s;&s;ure my&s;elf of is,
that though &s;eparated, perhaps for ever,
our &s;ouls are united by the mo&s;t ten|der
friend&s;hip and attachment. Per|haps
I may not find it po&s;&s;ible to
write to you again for a long while:
but be a&s;&s;ured that no meanaces, no &s;uf|ferings,
no dungeons &s;hall ever &s;hake
my fidelity to you, and that I &s;hall love
you to the la&s;t hour of my exi&s;tence.
I find a con&s;olation in the reflection that
it is for you I &s;uffer. If Providence
ever permits us to meet again, that
moment will efface the remembrance
<PB N="161" REF="163">
of all my calamities. Live, my dear|e&s;t
wife, in that hope. I conjure you
pre&s;erve your life for my &s;ake, and for
the &s;ake of our dear little girl! Em|brace
her tenderly for me, and de&s;ire
her al&s;o to embrace you for her poor
papa. I need not recommend my
child to the care of &s;o tender a mother;
but I conjure you to in&s;pire her mind
with the deepe&s;t &s;en&s;e of religion. If
&s;he is born to inherit the misfortunes
of her father, this will be her be&s;t
&s;ource of con&s;olation.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Whatever offers may be made you
by my father, I exhort you never have
the weakne&s;s to li&s;ten to them, but
pre&s;erve your rights, and tho&s;e of my
dear little girl, which, perhaps, may
one day be of &s;ome value. If you
are &s;till at Mrs. D&mdash;'s boarding-&s;chool,
tell her that I recommend my
wife and child to her compa&s;&s;ion.&mdash;But
what am I &s;aying? I am ignorant
<PB N="162" REF="164">
if you are &s;till with her, ignorant whe|ther
the deare&s;t objects of my affection
&s;till live! But I tru&s;t that Providence
has pre&s;erved you. Adieu! May God
Almighty ble&s;s you, and my child! I

<HEAD>LETTER XX.</HEAD>
<P>YOU, my dear friend, who have felt
the tender attachments of love and friend|&s;hip,
and the painful anxieties which ab|&s;ence
occa&s;ions, even amid&s;t &s;cenes of
variety and plea&s;ure; who under&s;tand the
value at which tidings from tho&s;e we love
is computed in the arithmetic of the
heart; who have heard with almo&s;t un|controulable
emotion the po&s;tman's rap
at the door; have trembling &s;een the
well-known hand which excited &s;en&s;a|tions
that almo&s;t deprived you of power
to break the &s;eal which &s;eemed the ta|li&s;man
of happine&s;s: you can judge of
the feelings of Mon&s;. Du F&mdash;when
he received, by means of the &s;ame friend
who had conveyed his letter, an an&s;wer
from his wife. But the per&s;on who
<PB N="164" REF="166">
brought the letter to his dungeon, dread|ing
the ri&s;k of a di&s;covery, in&s;i&s;ted, that
after having read it, he &s;hould return it
to him immediately. Mon&s;. Du F&mdash;pre&s;&s;ed
the letter to his heart, bathed it
with his tears, and implored the indul|gence
of keeping it at lea&s;t till the next
morning. He was allowed to do &s;o, and
read it till every word was imprinted on
his memory; and, after enjoying the &s;ad
luxury of holding it that night on his bo|&s;om,
was forced the next morning to re|linqui&s;h
his trea&s;ure.</P>
<P>On the 10th of October, 1780, the
Baron Du F&mdash;came to the convent,
and ordered the monks to bring his &s;on
from his dungeon to the parloir, and
leave them together. With the utmo&s;t
reluctance Mon&s;. Du F&mdash;obeyed this
&s;ummons, having long lo&s;t all hope of
&s;oftening the obdurate heart of his father.
When the monks withdrew, the Baron
began upbraiding him in the mo&s;t bitter
<PB N="165" REF="167">
terms, for his ob&s;tinate re&s;i&s;tance to his
will, which, he informed him, had availed
nothing, as he had gained his &s;uit at law,
and recovered the &s;even hundred pounds.
Mon&s;. Du F&mdash;replied, that the pain
he felt from this intelligence would have
been far more acute, had his wife been
deprived, with his concurrence, of the
money which was promi&s;ed for her &s;ub|&s;i&s;tence,
and on the reliance of which pro|mi&s;e
he had been tempted to leave Eng|land.
His father then enquired if he
&s;till per&s;i&s;ted in his adherence to the di&s;|graceful
connection he had formed; to
which his &s;on an&s;wered, that not merely
were his affections intere&s;ted, but that his
honour obliged him to maintain, with in|violable
fidelity, a &s;olemn and &s;acred en|gagement.
The rage of the Baron, at
the&s;e words, became unbounded. He
&s;tamped the ground with his feet; he
aimed a &s;troke at his &s;on, who, taking
advantage of this moment of frenzy, de|termined
<PB N="166" REF="168">
to attempt his e&s;cape; and, ru&s;h|ing
out of the apartment, and avoiding
that &s;ide of the convent which the monks
inhabited, he endeavoured to find his way
to the garden, but mi&s;&s;ed the pa&s;&s;age
which led to it. He then flew up a &s;tair|ca&s;e,
from which he heard the voice of
his father calling for a&s;&s;i&s;tance. Finding
that all the doors which he pa&s;&s;ed were
&s;hut, he continued a&s;cending till he reach|ed
the top of the building, where meet|ing
with no other opening than a hole
made in the &s;loping roof to let in light
to a garret, he climbed up with much
difficulty, and then putting his feet through
the hole, and letting his body out by de|grees,
he &s;upported him&s;elf for a moment
on the roof, and deliberated on what he
was about to do. But his mind was, at
this cri&s;is, wrought up to a pitch of de&s;|peration,
which mocked the &s;ugge&s;tions
of fear. He quitted his hold, and, fling|ing
him&s;elf from a height of nearly fifty
<PB N="167" REF="169">
feet, became in&s;en&s;ible before he reached
the ground, where he lay weltering in his
blood, and to all appearance dead.</P>
<P>He had fallen on the high road lead|ing
from Rouen to Caen. Some people
who were pa&s;&s;ing gathered round him,
and one per&s;on having wa&s;hed the blood
from his face, in&s;tantly recognized his
features, and exclaimed to the a&s;toni&s;hed
croud, that he was the elde&s;t &s;on of the
Baron Du F&mdash;. Upon examining his
body, it was found that he had broken his
arm, his thigh, his ancle-bone, and his
heel, be&s;ides having received many vio|lent
brui&s;es. He &s;till remained in a &s;tate
of in&s;en&s;ibility; and, while the&s;e charita|ble
&s;trangers were u&s;ing their efforts to
re&s;tore him to life, the monks ha&s;tened
from their convent, &s;natched their victim
from tho&s;e good Samaritans who would
have poured oil and wine into his wounds,
and carried him to the infirmary of the
convent, where he remained &s;ome weeks
<PB N="168" REF="170">
before he recovered his &s;en&s;es; after
which he lay &s;tretched upon a bed for
three months, &s;uffering agonies of pain.</P>
<P>His father, who had been the jailor,
and almo&s;t the murderer of his &s;on, heard
of the&s;e &s;ufferings without remor&s;e, nor
did he ever &s;ee him more. But, though
he was &s;ufficiently obdurate to bear un|moved
the calamities he had inflicted on
his child, though he could check the up|braidings
of his own con&s;cience, he could
not &s;ilence the voice of public indigna|tion.
The report that Mon&s;. Du F&mdash;had
been found lying on the road bathed
in blood, and had in that condition been
dragged to the pri&s;on of St. Yon, was
&s;oon &s;pread through the town of Rouen.
Every one &s;ympathized in the fate of this
unfortunate young man, and execrated
the tyranny of his unrelenting father.</P>
<P>The univer&s;al clamour reached the ear
of his brother, Mon&s;. De B&mdash;, who
now, for the fir&s;t time, out of re&s;pect to
<PB N="169" REF="171">
the public opinion, took a mea&s;ure which
his heart had never dictated during the
long captivity of his brother, that of vi|&s;iting
him in pri&s;on. Mon&s;. de. B&mdash;'s
de&s;ign in the&s;e vi&s;its was merely to appea&s;e
the public; for &s;mall indeed was the con|&s;olation
they afforded to his brother. He
did not come to bathe with his tears the
bed where that unhappy young man lay
&s;tretched in pain and angui&s;h; to lament
the &s;everity of his father; to offer him
all the con&s;olation of fraternal tender|ne&s;s;&mdash;he
came to warn him again&s;t in|dulging
a hope of ever regaining his li|berty&mdash;he
came to pierce his &s;oul with
&startq;hard unkindne&s;s' altered eye, which
mocks the tear it forc'd to flow!&endq;</P>
<P>I will not attempt to de&s;cribe the
wretchedne&s;s of Madame du F&mdash;,
when &s;he heard the report of her hu&s;|band's
&s;ituation. Your heart will con|ceive
what &s;he &s;uffered far better than I
can relate it. Three months after his
<PB N="170" REF="172">
fall, Mon&s;. du F&mdash;contrived, through
the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the charitable old monk,
to &s;end her a few lines written with his
left hand. &startq;My fall&endq; (he &s;ays) &startq;has
made my captivity known, and has led
the whole town of Rouen to take an
intere&s;t in my misfortunes. Perhaps I
&s;hall have rea&s;on to ble&s;s the accident,
which may po&s;&s;ibly prove the means of
procuring me my liberty, and uniting
me again to you!&mdash;In the mean time,
I tru&s;t that Providence will watch with
paternal goodne&s;s over the two objects
of my mo&s;t tender affection. Do not,
my deare&s;t wife, &s;uffer the thoughts of
my &s;ituation to prey too much upon
your mind. My arm is almo&s;t well:
my thigh and foot are not quite cured;
but I am getting better.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I could not &s;uppre&s;s my tears on read|ing
that part of your letter, wherein you
tell me that my dear little girl often
a&s;ks for her papa.&mdash;Ki&s;s her for me a
<PB N="171" REF="173">
thou&s;and times, and tell her that her
papa is always thinking of her and her
dear mama. I am well convinced that
you will give her the be&s;t education
your little pittance can afford. But
above all, I be&s;eech you, in&s;pire her
young mind with &s;entiments of piety:
teach her to love her Creator: that is
the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential of all le&s;&s;ons. Adieu,
deare&s;t and mo&s;t beloved of women!&mdash;Is
there a period in re&s;erve when we
&s;hall meet again? Oh how amply will
that moment compen&s;ate for all our
misfortunes!&endq;</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXI.</HEAD>
<P>AT length the Parliament of Rouen
began to intere&s;t it&s;elf in the cau&s;e of
Mon&s;. du F&mdash;. The circum&s;tances
of his confinement were mentioned in that
A&s;&s;embly, and the Pre&s;ident &s;ent his Se|cretary
to Mon&s;. du F&mdash;'s pri&s;on, who
had now quitted his bed, and was able to
walk with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of crutches. By
the advice of the Pre&s;ident, Mon&s;. du
F&mdash;addre&s;&s;ed &s;ome letters to the Par|liament,
repre&s;enting his &s;ituation in the
mo&s;t pathetic terms, and imploring their
interference in his behalf.</P>
<P>It is here nece&s;&s;ary to mention, that
Mon&s;. de Bel B&mdash;, Procureur Gene|ral
de Rouen, being intimately connected
with the Baron du F&mdash;'s family, had
ventured to demon&s;trate his friend&s;hip for
<PB N="173" REF="175">
the Baron, by confining his &s;on nearly
three years on his own authority, and
without any lettre de cachet. And, though
Mon&s;. de Bel B&mdash;well knew, that
every &s;pecies of oppre&s;&s;ion was connived
at, under the &s;helter of lettres de cachet,
he was &s;en&s;ible that it was only beneath
their au&s;pices that the exerci&s;e of tyranny
was permitted; and in this particular in|&s;tance,
not having been cruel<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">According to rules.</NOTE> &s;elon les
regles, he apprehended, that if ever Mon&s;.
du F&mdash;regained his liberty, he might
be made re&s;pon&s;ible for his conduct. He,
therefore, exerted all his influence, and
with too much &s;ucce&s;s, to fru&s;trate the be|nevolent
intention of the Pre&s;ident of the
Parliament, re&s;pecting Mon&s;. du F&mdash;.
His letters were indeed read in that A&s;|&s;embly,
and ordered to be regi&s;tered,
where they &s;till remain a record of the pu|&s;illanimity
of tho&s;e men, who &s;uffered the
<PB N="174" REF="176">
authority of Mon&s;. de Bel B&mdash;to
overcome the voice of humanity; who
acknowledged the atrocity of the Baron
du F&mdash;'s conduct, and yet were deaf
to the &s;upplications of his &s;on, while,
from the depth of his dungeon, he called
upon them for protection and redre&s;s.</P>
<P>May the fate of the captive, in the land
of France, no more hang &s;u&s;pended on
the frail thread of the pity, or the caprice
of individuals! May ju&s;tice erect, on eter|nal
foundations, her protecting &s;anctuary
for the oppre&s;&s;ed; and may humanity
and mercy be the graceful decorations of
her temple!</P>
<P>The Baron du F&mdash;perceived that,
notwith&s;tanding his machinations had pre|vented
the Parliament of Rouen from
taking any effectual mea&s;ures towards li|berating
his &s;on, it would be impo&s;&s;ible
to &s;ilence the murmurs of the public,
while he remained confined at St. Yon.
He determined, therefore, to remove him
<PB N="175" REF="177">
to &s;ome di&s;tant pri&s;on, where his name
and family were unknown; and where,
beyond the juri&s;diction of the Parliament
of Rouen, his groans might ri&s;e unpitied
and unavenged. But the Baron, not
daring, amid&s;t the general clamour, to re|move
his &s;on by force, endeavoured to
draw him artfully into the &s;nare he had
prepared.</P>
<P>Mon&s;. de B&mdash;was &s;ent to his bro|ther's
pri&s;on, where he repre&s;ented to him,
that, though he mu&s;t not indulge the lea&s;t
hope of ever regaining his liberty, yet, if
he would write a letter to Mon&s;. M&mdash;,
keeper of the &s;eals, de&s;iring to be removed
to &s;ome other place, his confinement &s;hould
be made far le&s;s rigorous. Mon&s;. du
F&mdash;was now in a &s;tate of de&s;peration,
that rendered him almo&s;t carele&s;s of his
fate. He perceived that the Parliament
had renounced his cau&s;e. He &s;aw no po&s;|&s;ibility
of e&s;cape from St. Yon; and flat|tered
him&s;elf, that in a place where he was
<PB N="176" REF="178">
le&s;s clo&s;ely confined, it might perhaps be
practicable; and therefore he con&s;ented
to write the letter required, which Mon&s;.
de B&mdash;conveyed in triumph to his
father. There were, however, &s;ome ex|pre&s;&s;ions
in the letter which the Baron
di&s;approved, on which account he returned
it, de&s;iring that tho&s;e expre&s;&s;ions might be
changed. But, during the interval of his
brother's ab&s;ence, Mon&s;. du F&mdash;had
reflected on the ra&s;h imprudence of con|fiding
in the promi&s;es of tho&s;e by whom
he had been &s;o cruelly deceived. No
&s;ooner, therefore, did Mon&s;. de B&mdash;put
the letter again into his hands, than
he tore it into pieces, and peremptorily
refu&s;ed to write another.</P>
<P>Soon after this, Mon&s;. du B&mdash;, the
amba&s;&s;ador of the tyrant, again returned
to his brother with fre&s;h credentials, and
declared to him, that if he would write
to the keeper of the &s;eals, de&s;iring to be
removed from St. Yon, he &s;hould, in one
<PB N="177" REF="179">
fortnight after his removal, be re&s;tored to
liberty. Upon Mon&s;. du F&mdash;'s a&s;|&s;erting
that he could no longer confide in
the promi&s;es made him by his family, his
brother, in a formal written engagement,
to which he &s;igned his name, gave him
the mo&s;t &s;olemn a&s;&s;urance, that this pro|mi&s;e
&s;hould be fulfilled with fidelity.
Mon&s;. du F&mdash;de&s;ired a few days for
deliberation, and, during that interval,
found means of con&s;ulting a magi&s;trate
of Rouen who was his friend, and who
advi&s;ed him to comply with the terms
that were offered, after having cau&s;ed &s;e|veral
copies of the written engagement
to be taken, and certified by &s;uch of the
pri&s;oners at St. Yon as were likely to re|gain
their freedom; a precaution nece&s;|&s;ary,
le&s;t his own copy &s;hould be torn
from his hands.</P>
<P>Thus, having neither tru&s;ted to the af|fection,
the mercy, or the remor&s;e of tho&s;e
within who&s;e bo&s;oms &s;uch &s;entiments were
<PB N="178" REF="180">
extingui&s;hed; having bargained, by a
written agreement, with a father and a
brother, for his relea&s;e from the horrors
of perpetual captivity, Mon&s;. du F&mdash;wrote
the letter required.</P>
<P>Soon after, an order was &s;ent from
Ver&s;ailles for his relea&s;e from the pri&s;on
of St. Yon, and with it a lettre de cachet,
whereby he was exiled to Beauvais, with
a command not to leave that town. Mon&s;.
de B&mdash;, acting as a<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">An officer of ju&s;tice.</NOTE> Cavalier de la
Marechau&s;&s;&eacute;e, conducted his brother to
this place of exile, and there left him.
A &s;hort time after, Mon&s;. du F&mdash;re|ceived
an intimation, from that magi|&s;trate
of Rouen who had intere&s;ted him|&s;elf
in his misfortunes, that his father was
on the point of obtaining another lettre
de cachet, to remove him from Beauvais,
to &s;ome pri&s;on in the &s;outh of France,
where he might never more be heard of.
<PB N="179" REF="181">
This gentleman added, that Mon&s;. du
F&mdash;had not one moment to lo&s;e, and
advi&s;ed him immediately to attempt his
e&s;cape.</P>
<P>Early on the morning after he receiv|ed
this intelligence, Mon&s;. du F&mdash;,
who had the liberty to walk about the
town, fled from Beauvais. The per&s;on
who brought him the letter from the ma|gi&s;trate,
waited for him at a little di&s;tance
from the town, and accompanied him on
his journey. When they reached Li&s;le
in Flanders, not having a pa&s;&s;port, they
were obliged to wait from eleven o'clock
at night till ten the next morning, before
they could obtain permi&s;&s;ion from the
Governor to proceed on their journey.
Mon&s;. du F&mdash;concluded that he was
pur&s;ued, and &s;uffered the mo&s;t dreadful
apprehen&s;ions of being overtaken. His
companion, with &s;ome addre&s;s, at length
obtained a pa&s;&s;port, and attended him as
far as O&s;tend. The wind proving con|trary,
<PB N="180" REF="182">
he was detained two days in a &s;tate
of the mo&s;t di&s;tracting inquietude, and
concealed him&s;elf on board the ve&s;&s;el in
which he had taken his pa&s;&s;age for Eng|land.
At length the wind became fa|vourable;
the ve&s;&s;el &s;ailed, and arrived
late in the night at Margate. Mon&s;. du
F&mdash;, when he reached the Engli&s;h
&s;hore, knelt down, and, in a tran&s;port of
joy, ki&s;&s;ed the earth of that dear country
which had twice proved his a&s;ylum.</P>
<P>He then enquired when the &s;tage-coach
&s;et off for London, and was told that it
went at &s;o early an hour the next morn|ing,
that he could not go till the day af|ter,
as he mu&s;t wait till his portmanteau
was examined by the cu&s;tom-hou&s;e offi|cers,
who were now in bed. The delay
of a few hours in &s;eeing his wife and child,
after &s;uch an ab&s;ence, after &s;uch &s;uffer|ings,
was not to be endured. In a vio|lent
agitation of mind, he &s;natched up his
portmanteau, and was going to fling it
<PB N="181" REF="183">
into the &s;ea, when he was prevented by
the people near him, who &s;aid, that if he
would pay the fees, his portmanteau
&s;hould be &s;ent after him. He eagerly
complied with their demands, and &s;et out
for London. As he drew near, his anx|iety,
his impatience, his emotion increa&s;ed.
His pre&s;ent &s;ituation appeared to him like
one of tho&s;e delicious dreams, which
&s;ometimes vi&s;ited the darkne&s;s of his dun|geon,
and for a while re&s;tored him, in
imagination, to tho&s;e he loved. Scarcely
could he per&s;uade him&s;elf that he was
beyond the reach of oppre&s;&s;ion; that he
was in a land of freedom; that he was
ha&s;tening every moment towards his wife
and child. When he entered London,
his &s;en&s;ations became almo&s;t too &s;trong to
bear. He was in the very &s;ame place
which his wife and child inhabited&mdash;but
were they yet alive? were they in health?
had Heaven indeed re&s;erved for him the
tran&s;port of holding them once more to
<PB N="182" REF="184">
his bo&s;om, of mixing his tears with theirs?
When he knocked at the door of the
hou&s;e where he expected to hear of Ma|dame
du F&mdash;, he had &s;carcely power
to articulate his enquiries after her and his
child. He was told that they were in
health, but that Madame du F&mdash;, be|ing
in a &s;ituation &s;ix miles from London,
he could not &s;ee her till the next morn|ing.
Mon&s;. du F&mdash;had not been in
a bed for &s;everal nights, and was almo&s;t
overcome with agitation and fatigue. He,
however, in&s;tantly &s;et out on foot for the
habitation of his wife, announced him&s;elf
to the mi&s;tre&s;s of the family, and remain|ed
in another apartment, while &s;he, after
making Madame du F&mdash;promi&s;e that
&s;he would li&s;ten to her with calmne&s;s, told
her, that there was a probability of her
hu&s;band's return to England. He heard
the &s;obs, the exclamations, of his wife at
this intelligence&mdash;he could re&s;train no
longer&mdash;he ru&s;hed into the room&mdash;he
<PB N="183" REF="185">
flew into her arms&mdash;he continued pre&s;|&s;ing
her in &s;ilence to his bo&s;om. She
was unable to &s;hed a tear; and it was
not till after he had long endeavoured to
&s;ooth her by his tenderne&s;s, and had talked
to her of her child, that &s;he obtained re|lief
from weeping. She then, with the
mo&s;t violent emotion, again and again re|peated
the &s;ame enquiries, and was a con|&s;iderable
time before &s;he recovered any
degree of compo&s;ure.</P>
<P>All the fortune Mon&s;. du F&mdash;po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed
when he reached London, was one
half guinea; but his wife had, during his
ab&s;ence, &s;aved ten guineas out of her lit|tle
&s;alary. You will ea&s;ily imagine how
valuable this hoard became in her e&s;tima|tion,
when &s;he could apply it to the pre|cious
u&s;e of relieving the nece&s;&s;ities of her
hu&s;band. Mon&s;. Du F&mdash;went to
London the next day, and hired a little
garret: there, with a few books, a ru&s;h|light,
and &s;ome &s;traw in which he wrap|ped
<PB N="184" REF="186">
his legs to &s;upply the want of fire,
he recollected not the &s;plendour to which
he had once been accu&s;tomed, but the
dungeon from which he had e&s;caped. He
&s;aw his wife and child once a week; and,
in tho&s;e &s;olitary moments, when books
failed to &s;ooth his thoughts, he anticipa|ted
the hour in which he &s;hould again
meet the objects mo&s;t dear to his heart,
and pa&s;&s;ed the intervals of time in philo|&s;ophic
re&s;ignation. His clothes being too
&s;habby to admit of his appearing in the
day, he i&s;&s;ued from his little &s;hed when it
was dark, and endeavoured to warm him|&s;elf
by the exerci&s;e of walking.</P>
<P>Unfortunately he caught the &s;mall-pox,
and his di&s;order ro&s;e to &s;uch a height,
that his life was de&s;paired of. In his de|lirium,
he u&s;ed to recapitulate the &s;ad
&s;tory of his misfortunes; and when he &s;aw
any per&s;on near his bed-&s;ide, would call
out, with the utmo&s;t vehemence,<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Make all the French go out.</NOTE> &startq;Qu'on

<HEAD>LETTER XXII.</HEAD>
<P>SIX months after Mon&s;. du F&mdash;'s
return to England, his family found them|&s;elves
compelled to &s;ilence the public cla|mours,
by allowing him a &s;mall annual
pen&s;ion. Upon this, Madame du F&mdash;quitted
her place, and came to live with
her hu&s;band and her child in an ob&s;cure
lodging. Their little income received
&s;ome addition by means of teaching the
French language in a few private families.</P>
<P>A young lady, who came to pay me a
vi&s;it at London in 1785, de&s;ired to take
&s;ome le&s;&s;ons in French, and Madame du
<PB N="186" REF="188">
F&mdash;was recommended to us for that
purpo&s;e. We &s;oon perceived in her con|ver&s;ation
every mark of a cultivated mind,
and of an amiable di&s;po&s;ition. She at
length told us the hi&s;tory of her misfortunes,
with the pathetic eloquence of her own
charming language; and, after having heard
that recital, it required but common hu|manity,
to treat her with the re&s;pect due
to the unhappy, and to feel for her &s;orrows
that &s;ympathy to which they had &s;uch
claim. How much has the &s;en&s;ibility of
Mon&s;. and Madame du F&mdash;over-rated
tho&s;e proofs of e&s;teem and friend&s;hip
which we were enabled to &s;hew them in
their adver&s;ity!&mdash;But I mu&s;t not antici|pate.</P>
<P>On the &s;eventh of October, 1787, the
Baron died, leaving, be&s;ides Mon&s;. du
F&mdash;, two other &s;ons, and a daughter.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t here mention, that at the time
when Mon&s;. du F&mdash;was confined to
his bed in the pri&s;on of St. Yon, from the
<PB N="187" REF="189">
con&s;equences of his fall, his father, in
order to avoid the clamours at Rouen,
went for &s;ome weeks to Paris. He there
made a will, di&s;inheriting his elde&s;t &s;on.
By the old laws of France, however, a
father could not puni&s;h his &s;on more than
once for the &s;ame offence. Nor was there
any thing in &s;o mild a clau&s;e that could
much encourage di&s;obedience; &s;ince this
&s;ingle puni&s;hment, of which the mercy
of the law was careful to avoid repetition,
might be extended to re&s;idence for life in
a dungeon. Such was evidently the in|tention
of the Baron du F&mdash;: and,
though his &s;on, di&s;appointing this intention,
had e&s;caped with only three years of cap|tivity,
and &s;ome broken limbs, the benig|nant
law above-mentioned interpo&s;ed to
prevent farther puni&s;hment, and left the
Baron without any legal right to deprive
Mon&s;. du F&mdash;of his inheritance. His
brothers, being &s;en&s;ible of this, wrote to
inform him of his father's death, and recal
<PB N="188" REF="190">
him to France. He refu&s;ed to go while
the lettre de cachet remained in force
again&s;t him. The Baron having left all
his papers &s;ealed up, which his younger
&s;ons could not open but in the pre&s;ence of
their brother, they obtained the revocation
of the lettre de cachet, and &s;ent it to
Mon&s;. du F&mdash;, who immediately &s;et
off for France.</P>
<P>The Baron's e&s;tate amounted to about
four thou&s;and pounds a year. Willing
to avoid a tedious litigation with his bro|thers,
Mon&s;. du F&mdash;con&s;ented to di|vide
with them this property. But he
&s;oon found rea&s;on to repent of his impru|dent
genero&s;ity; tho&s;e very brothers, on
whom he had be&s;towed an equal &s;hare of
his fortune, refu&s;ing to concur with him
in his application to the parliament of
Rouen for the revocation of the arret
again&s;t his marriage&punc; Mon&s;. du F&mdash;,
&s;urpri&s;ed and &s;hocked at their refu&s;al,
began to entertain &s;ome apprehen&s;ions of
<PB N="189" REF="191">
his per&s;onal &s;afety; and dreading that,
&s;upported by the authority of his mother,
another lettre de cachet might be ob|tained
again&s;t him, he ha&s;tened back to
England. Nor was it till after he had re|ceived
a&s;&s;urances from &s;everal of the ma|gi&s;trates
of Rouen, that they would be
re&s;pon&s;ible for the &s;afety of his per&s;on,
that he again ventured to return to France,
accompanied by Madame and Mademoi|&s;elle
du F&mdash;, in order to obtain the re|vocation
of the arret. On their arrival at
Rouen, finding that the parliament was
exiled, and that the bu&s;ine&s;s could not be
pro&s;ecuted at that time, they again came
back to pa&s;s the winter in England.</P>
<P>At this period his mother died; and in
the following &s;ummer Mon&s;. and Ma|dame
du F&mdash;arrived in France, at the
great epocha of French liberty, on the
15th of July, 1789, the very day after
that on which the Ba&s;tille was taken. It
was then that Mon&s;. du F&mdash;felt him|&s;elf
<PB N="190" REF="192">
in &s;ecurity on his native &s;hore.&mdash;It was
then that his dome&s;tic comforts were no
longer embittered with the dread of being
torn from his family by a &s;eparation more
terrible than death it&s;elf.&mdash;It was then that
he no more feared that his repo&s;e at night
would be broken by the entrance of ruf|fians
prepared to drag him to dungeons,
the darkne&s;s of which was never vi&s;ited
by the ble&s;&s;ed beams of day!</P>
<P>He immediately took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his
chateau, and only waits for the appoint|ment
of the new judges, to &s;olicit the re|vocation
of the arret again&s;t his marriage,
and to &s;ecure the inheritance of his e&s;tate
to Mademoi&s;elle du F&mdash;, his only
daughter, who is now fifteen years of age,
and is that very child who was born in
the bo&s;om of adver&s;ity, and who&s;e infancy
was expo&s;ed to all the mi&s;eries of want.
May &s;he never know the afflictions of her
parents, but may &s;he inherit their virtues!</P>
<P>Under the antient government of France,
<PB N="191" REF="193">
there might have been &s;ome doubt of
Mon&s;. du F&mdash;'s obtaining the revoca|tion
of the arret again&s;t his marriage. Be|neath
the iron hand of de&s;poti&s;m, ju&s;tice and
virtue might have been overthrown. But
happier omens belong to the new con&s;ti|tution
of France. The judges will com|mence
their high office with that dignity
becoming &s;o important a tru&s;t, by can|celling
an act of the mo&s;t flagrant op|pre&s;&s;ion.
They will confirm that &s;olemn,

Madame du F&mdash;have three times
vowed at the altar of God!&mdash;which has
been &s;anctioned by laws human and di|vine&mdash;which
has been ratified in earth

<P>No &s;ooner had Mon&s;. and Madame du

than they &s;eemed eager to convince us,
how little this change of fortune was ca|pable

<PB N="204" REF="206">
formed the mo&s;t con&s;iderable part of the
audience, and I believe no play, in antient
or modern times, was ever acted with
more applau&s;e. My &s;i&s;ter took a part in
the performance, which I declined doing,
till I recollected that one of the principal
characters was a &s;tatue; upon which, I
con&s;ented to perform<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">The fine part of the &s;tatue.</NOTE> le beau role de

with all her u&s;ual attributes, and guarding
the con&s;ecrated banners of the nation,
which were placed on an altar, on which
was in&s;cribed, in tran&s;parent letters,<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">To Liberty, July 14th, 1789.</NOTE> &startq;A

Thus do the French, le&s;t they &s;hould be
<PB N="206" REF="208">
tempted, by plea&s;ure, to forget one mo|ment
the cau&s;e of liberty, bind it to their
remembrance in the hour of fe&s;tivity,
with fillets and &s;carfs of national ribband;
connect it with the &s;ound of the viol and
the harp, and appoint it not merely to re|gulate
the great movements of govern|ment,
but to mold the figure of the
dance. When the cotillon was fini&s;hed,
&s;ome beautiful fire-works were played
off, and we then went to &s;upper.<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">You are well placed, Sir.</NOTE> &startq;Vous

Apropos of poets.&mdash;The French have
conquered many old prejudices, but their
prejudice again&s;t Shake&s;peare &s;till exi&s;ts.
They well know, that though in England
it is our policy, or our plea&s;ure, to have
an oppo&s;ition on every other &s;ubject, we
have not one di&s;&s;enting voice about
Shake&s;peare; and therefore they allow
that he may, perhaps, de&s;erve to be the
idol of the Briti&s;h nation, a &s;ort of hou&s;e|hold
god whom we delight to honour;
but they have gods of their own to whom
they pay homage, and have little idea that
Shake&s;peare was not only the glory of
England, but of human nature. It would
be a hopele&s;s attempt to convince them,
that the genius of their boa&s;ted Corneille
has &s;omething of the proud and affected
greatne&s;s of Lewis the Fourteenth, while
that of Shake&s;peare has more affinity to
the noble dignified &s;implicity of Henry
the Fourth. They repeat, till you are
weary of the remark, that French trage|dies
<PB N="210" REF="212">
are regular dramas, while Shake|&s;peare's
plays are mon&s;ters. This re|minds
me of Boileau's an&s;wer to an au|thor
who had brought him a play to read,
of which Boileau di&s;approved. Sir, ex|claimed
the enraged author, I defy malice
to &s;ay that my piece tran&s;gre&s;&s;es any one
of the rules. &startq;Why, Sir,&endq; replied Boi|leau,
&startq;it tran&s;gre&s;&s;es the fir&s;t rule of all,
that of keeping the reader awake.&endq;</P>
<P>The young gentleman who, as I men|tioned
to you, was confined at St. Yon,
in the cell adjoining Mon&s;. du F&mdash;'s,
and with whom he u&s;ed to conver&s;e in
whi&s;pers through a hole in the wall, is
come to pay a vi&s;it at the chateau. This
young man went very early into the ar|my:
but, at the age of twenty, his father
being at St. Domingo, and his mother
con&s;idering her &s;on as a &s;py upon her
conduct, which was &s;uch as &s;hrunk from
in&s;pection, obtained a lettre de cachet
again&s;t him, and he was confined three
<PB N="211" REF="213">
years at St. Yon. He has told me, that,
after the fir&s;t year, he lo&s;t all hope of
ever regaining his liberty. A morbid
melancholy &s;eized his mind; he lay &s;tretch|ed
on the &s;ame bed for two years; and
&s;ometimes refu&s;ed to ta&s;te food for &s;eve|ral
days together. When his father, at
his return from St. Domingo, came to
liberate him, he was &s;o feeble that he was
unable to walk.</P>
<P>His father again left France, and the
brother of this young man has &s;uffered a
fate even more &s;evere than him&s;elf. At
the age of fifteen, he was guilty of &s;ome
indi&s;cretions, which incurred the re&s;ent|ment
of his unrelenting mother, and ano|ther
lettre de cachet was obtained.&mdash;
&startq;Is there any cau&s;e in nature that makes
the&s;e hard hearts?&endq;&mdash;He was confined
ten years, and only relea&s;ed when all the
pri&s;ons were thrown open, by order of the
National A&s;&s;embly. But for this un|happy
young man their mercy came too
<PB N="212" REF="214">
late&mdash;His rea&s;on was gone forever! and
he was led out of his pri&s;on, at the age
of five and twenty, a maniac. When
the &s;en&s;ibility with which his brother re|lates
the&s;e family misfortunes melts us
into tears, we are told,<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Melancholy is the di&s;ea&s;e of Engli&s;h coal fires.</NOTE> que la tri&s;te&s;&s;e,

<P>You will not be &s;urprized to hear that

relinqui&s;hed his title; and that,
being a ci-devant <HI>captive,</HI> as well as a ci|devant

of per&s;onal &s;ecurity, the &s;weetne&s;s of do|me&s;tic
comfort, in &s;hort, that the com|mon
rights of man are of more value than
he ever found the rights of nobility in the
&s;olitude of his dungeon. He is ready to
acknowledge, that confinement in a &s;ub|terraneous
cell, a fall from a height of
fifty feet, and the fracture of his limbs,
<PB N="213" REF="215">
are things which even the title of Baron

<HEAD>LETTER XXVI.</HEAD>
<OPENER>London.</OPENER>
<P>WE left France early in September,
that we might avoid the equinoctial gales;
but were &s;o unfortunate as to meet, in our
pa&s;&s;age from Dieppe to Brighton, with a
very violent &s;torm. We were two days
and two nights at &s;ea, and beat four and
twenty hours off the coa&s;t of Brighton;
and it would be difficult for you, who
have formed your calculations of time
on dry land, to gue&s;s what is the length
of four and twenty hours in a &s;torm at
&s;ea. At la&s;t, with great difficulty, we
landed on the beach, where we found &s;e|veral
of our friends and acquaintance,
who, &s;uppo&s;ing that we might be among
the pa&s;&s;engers, &s;ympathi&s;ed with our dan|ger,
and were anxious for our pre&s;ervation.</P>
<P>Before the &s;torm became &s;o &s;erious as
<PB N="216" REF="218">
to exclude every idea but that of prepar|ing
to die with compo&s;ure, I could not
help being diverted with the comments
on French cu&s;toms, and French politics,
which pa&s;&s;ed in the cabin. &startq;Ah,&endq; &s;ays
one man to his companion, &startq;one had
need to go to France, to know how to
like old England when one gets back
again.&endq;&mdash;&startq;For my part,&endq; rejoined ano|ther,
&startq;I've never been able to get drunk
once the whole time I was in France&mdash;
not a drop of porter to be had&mdash;and as
for their victuals, they call a bit of meat
of a pound and a half, a fine piece of
roa&s;t beef.&endq;&mdash;&startq;And pray,&endq; added he,
turning to one of the &s;ailors, &startq;What do
you think of their National A&s;&s;embly?&endq;&mdash;
&startq;Why,&endq; &s;ays the &s;ailor, &startq;if I ben't mi&s;|taken,
the National A&s;&s;embly has got
&s;ome points from the wind.&endq;</P>
<P>I own it has &s;urprized me not a little,
&s;ince I came to London, to find that mo&s;t
of my acquaintance are of the &s;ame opi|nion
<PB N="217" REF="219">
with the &s;ailor. Every vi&s;itor brings
me intelligence from France full of di&s;|may
and horror. I hear of nothing but
crimes, a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inations, torture, and death.
I am told that every day witne&s;&s;es a con|&s;piracy;
that every town is the &s;cene of
a ma&s;&s;acre; that every &s;treet is blackened
with a gallows, and every highway deluged
with blood. I hear the&s;e things, and re|peat
to my&s;elf, Is this the picture of
France? Are the&s;e the images of that
univer&s;al joy, which called tears into my
eyes, and made my heart throb with &s;ym|pathy?&mdash;To
me, the land which the&s;e
mighty magicians have &s;uddenly covered
with darkne&s;s, where, waving their evil
wand, they have reared the di&s;mal &s;caffold,
have clotted the knife of the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in with
gore, have called forth the &s;hriek of de&s;|pair,
and the agony of torture; to me,
this land of de&s;olation appeared dre&s;t in
additional beauty beneath the genial &s;mile
of liberty. The woods &s;eemed to ca&s;t a
<PB N="218" REF="220">
more refre&s;hing &s;hade, and the lawns to
wear a brighter verdure, while the carols
of freedom bur&s;t from the cottage of the
pea&s;ant, and the voice of joy re&s;ounded
on the hill, and in the valley.</P>
<P>Mu&s;t I be told that my mind is per|verted,
that I am become dead to all &s;en|&s;ations
of &s;ympathy, becau&s;e I do not weep
with tho&s;e who have lo&s;t a part of their
&s;uperfluities, rather than rejoice that the op|pre&s;&s;ed
are protected, that the wronged are
redre&s;&s;ed, that the captive is &s;et at liber|ty,
and that the poor have bread? Did
the univer&s;al parent of the human race,
implant the feelings of pity in the heart,
that they &s;hould be confined to the artifi|cial
wants of vanity, the ideal deprivations
of greatne&s;s; that they &s;hould be fixed
beneath the dome of the palace, or locked
within the gate of the chateau; without
extending one commi&s;erating &s;igh to the
wretched hamlet, as if its fami&s;hed inha|bitants,
though not ennobled by <HI>man,</HI> did
<PB N="219" REF="221">
not bear, at lea&s;t, the en&s;igns of nobility
&s;tamped on our nature by God?</P>
<P>Mu&s;t I hear the charming &s;ocieties, in
which I found all the elegant graces of
the mo&s;t poli&s;hed manners, all the amiable
urbanity of liberal and cultivated minds,
compared with the mo&s;t rude, ferocious,
and barbarous levellers that ever exi&s;ted?
Really, &s;ome of my Engli&s;h acquaint|ance,
whatever objections they may have
to republican principles, do, in their di&s;|cu&s;&s;ions
of French politics, adopt a mo&s;t
free and republican &s;tyle of cen&s;ure. No|thing
can be more democratical than their
mode of expre&s;&s;ion, or di&s;play a more le|velling
&s;pirit, than their unqualified con|tempt
of <HI>all</HI> the leaders of the revolu|tion.</P>
<P>It is not my intention to &s;hiver lances,
in every &s;ociety I enter, in the cau&s;e of the
National A&s;&s;embly. Yet I cannot help
remarking, that, &s;ince that A&s;&s;embly does
not pre&s;ume to &s;et it&s;elf up as an example
<PB N="220" REF="222">
to this country, we &s;eem to have very lit|tle
right to be furiou&s;ly angry, becau&s;e
they think proper to try another &s;y&s;tem of
government them&s;elves. Why &s;hould
they not be &s;uffered to make an expe|riment
in politics? I have always been
told, that the improvement of every
&s;cience depends upon experiment. But
I now hear that, in&s;tead of their new at|tempt
to form the great machine of &s;o|ciety
upon a &s;imple principle of general
amity, upon the FEDERATION of its mem|bers,
they ought to have repaired the feu|dal
wheels and &s;prings, by which their
ance&s;tors directed its movements. Yet
if mankind had always ob&s;erved this re|trograde
motion, it would &s;urely have led
them to few acqui&s;itions in virtue, or in
knowledge; and we might even have
been wor&s;hipping the idols of pagani&s;m
at this moment. To forbid, under the
pains and penalties of reproach, all at|tempts
of the human mind to advance to
<PB N="221" REF="223">
greater perfection, &s;eems to be pro|&s;cribing
every art and &s;cience. And we
cannot much wonder that the French, ha|ving
received &s;o &s;mall a legacy of public
happine&s;s from their forefathers, and be|ing
&s;en&s;ible of the poverty of their own
patrimony, &s;hould try new methods of
tran&s;mitting a richer inheritance to their
po&s;terity.</P>
<P>Perhaps the improvements which man|kind
may be capable of making in the
art of politics, may have &s;ome re&s;em|blance
to tho&s;e they have made in the art
of navigation. Perhaps our political
plans may hitherto have been &s;omewhat
like tho&s;e ill-con&s;tructed mis&s;hapen ve&s;|&s;els,
which, unfit to combat with the
winds and waves, were only u&s;ed by the
antients to convey the warriors of one
country to de&s;poil and ravage another
neighbouring &s;tate; which only &s;erved to
produce an intercour&s;e of ho&s;tility, a com|munication
of injury, an exchange of ra|pine
<PB N="222" REF="224">
and deva&s;tation.&mdash;But it may po&s;|&s;ibly
be within the compa&s;s of human
ability to form a &s;y&s;tem of politics, which,
like a modern &s;hip of di&s;covery, built
upon principles that defy the oppo&s;ition
of the tempe&s;tuous elements (&startq;and pa&s;|&s;ions
are the elements of life&endq;&mdash;) in&s;tead
of yielding to their fury makes them
&s;ub&s;ervient to its purpo&s;e, and &s;ailing
&s;ublimely over the untracked ocean,
unites tho&s;e together whom nature &s;eem|ed
for ever to have &s;eparated, and throws
a line of connection acro&s;s the divided
world.</P>
<P>One cau&s;e of the general di&s;like in which
the French revolution is held in this coun|try,
is the exaggerated &s;tories which are
carefully circulated by &s;uch of the ari&s;to|crates
as have taken refuge in England.
They are not all, however, per&s;ons of this
de&s;cription. There is now a young gen|tleman
in London, nephew to the Bi&s;hop
de Sens, who has lo&s;t his fortune, his rank,
<PB N="223" REF="225">
all his high expectations, and yet who has
the genero&s;ity to applaud the revolution,
and the magnanimity to reconcile him&s;elf
to per&s;onal calamities, from the con&s;ide|ration
of general good; and who is
&startq;faithful found&endq; to his country, &startq;among
the faithle&s;s.&endq; I hope this amiable young
Frenchman will live to witne&s;s, and to
&s;hare the honours, the pro&s;perity of that
regenerated country; and I al&s;o hope that
the National A&s;&s;embly of France will
an&s;wer the objections of its adver&s;aries in
the manner mo&s;t becoming its own dig|nity,
by forming &s;uch a con&s;titution as
will render the French nation virtuous,
flouri&s;hing, and happy.</P>
