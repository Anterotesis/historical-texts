<HEAD>THE AUTHOR's APOLOGY.</HEAD>
<P>IT is with infinite gratitude I review the number of &s;ub&s;cribers to this work, and their elevated character, as well in the literary world, as the honours with which many of them are di&s;tingui&s;hed; and I acknowledge my&s;elf highly &s;en&s;ible of the attention the public was plea&s;ed to pay to the two fir&s;t volumes.</P>
<P>It is incumbent upon me, to refer to the public eye the circum&s;tances which have delayed the appearance of this volume, and the adver&s;e events which have embara&s;&s;ed its progre&s;s.</P>
<P>In the cour&s;e of tho&s;e &s;uits in which I was unfortunately involved, it was nece&s;&s;ary <HI>George Allan,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> &s;hould be called upon to give te&s;timony both at law, and in equity; a matter in which I laboured with the utmo&s;t reluctance, and pur&s;ued with every degree of delicacy, that his &s;ituation, and the circum&s;tances which my ca&s;e involved, required.</P>
<P>As Mr. Allan &s;tood forth publicly to give his evidence, and al&s;o put in an an&s;wer upon oath to my bill in the Exchequer, tho&s;e facts to which he &s;wore can|not be doubted or controverted; and I humbly conceive they fully contain my ju&s;tification.</P>
<P>Mr. Allan having <Q>collected many valuable materials, which he apprehended &startq;were nece&s;&s;ary to the compilation of a <HI>Hi&s;tory of the County Palatine of Durham,</HI> applied to, and frequently importuned," me "to undertake that work, and he accordingly delivered over many records, together with a variety of manu&s;cripts and printed tran&s;cripts, which had been compiled and collected without any chronological order or regularity, and which then lay in his cu&s;tody uncla&s;&s;ed, and in an undige&s;ted &s;tate."&mdash;"And" I "did accordingly compo&s;e and write, and &endq;was &s;olely the author of the work.</Q>&mdash;</P>
<P>&mdash;At Mr. Hodg&s;on's in&s;tance, all the manu&s;cript of the work was delivered to Mr. Allan, for his revi&s;al, before it went to the pre&s;s, and in his te&s;timony he &s;aid, that he verily believed I did <Q>e&s;teem the delivery to be virtually a delivery to the &startq;&endq;u&s;e of Mr. Hodg&s;on.</Q></P>
<P>&mdash;Being <Q>totally ignorant of the method of mea&s;uring and apportioning of &startq;&endq;the printing of works of this kind and extent,</Q> it was not till after the &s;econd volume was far advanced in the pre&s;s, that Mr. Allan di&s;covered to me that the manu&s;cript which remained unprinted would run out &s;o far as greatly to exceed the limits of a &s;econd volume; from thence it appeared, that an unfore&s;een expence would fall upon Mr. Hodg&s;on, which was not provided again&s;t in his contract. On this account, "in the latter end of the month of October, 1786," we "took a journey to Newca&s;tle upon Tyne, when" I <Q>voluntarily offered to Mr. &startq;Hodg&s;on to bear the expences of printing and paper, for all &s;uch part as &s;hould
<PB N="iv" REF="4">&s;ucceed the account given of Sherburn Ho&s;pital, at which period it was then &endq;propo&s;ed the &s;econd volume &s;hould clo&s;e;</Q> and &s;oon afterwards I &s;igned receipts for the &s;ub&s;cription money for the &s;econd volume, by which I undertook to deliver the third part to the &s;ub&s;cribers gratis. It was then calculated, that &s;uch third part would be compri&s;ed in about two hundred pages.</P>
<P>The work, as originally propo&s;ed to be publi&s;hed, <HI>"was confined within the limits of the rivers Tyne and Tees:"</HI> propo&s;als were made for publi&s;hing an addition, but Mr. Hodg&s;on conceiving that it would prejudice the &s;ale of what he had contracted for, the project was given up.</P>
<P>Mr. Allan, in the mo&s;t generous and unequivocal manner, both in his an&s;wer and oral te&s;timony, acquitted me of the delays which had attended the &s;equel of the work, and declared that he had in his hands the whole manu&s;cript which remained unprinted prior to the month of January, 1790, after it had been revi&s;ed by me, and much thereof expunged, at the reque&s;t of Mr. Hodg&s;on. Mr. Allan admit|ted, <Q>that he was repeatedly importuned by" me, "in the mo&s;t pre&s;&s;ing manner, &startq;to forward the manu&s;cript to Mr. Hodg&s;on, that the printing might be pro|ceeded in without delay; and believes the &s;everal delays which happened in the publication occa&s;ioned" me "repeatedly to complain thereof to Mr. Hodg&s;on, and al&s;o to require the delivery of the manu&s;cript" by Mr. Allan "to him in the &s;tate it then was in his hands. And that in revi&s;ing the manu&s;cript, and correcting the pre&s;s and proof &s;heets, he acted as the friend and a&s;&s;i&s;tant of Mr. &endq;Hodg&s;on in a mo&s;t e&s;pecial manner, and without gratuity, promi&s;e, or pro&s;pect of reward.</Q></P>
<P>The cau&s;e at law in which Mr. Hodg&s;on was plaintiff, grounded on a breach of contract for the non-delivery of the manu&s;cript, being at i&s;&s;ue, and coming down to be tried at the a&s;&s;izes held for the town and county of Newca&s;tle upon Tyne, at the guild-hall there, in the &s;ummer of the year 1793, before the Lord Chief Baron Sir Archibald Macdonald, Knight, and by a mo&s;t re&s;pectable &s;pecial jury of that liberty; on the opening of the cau&s;e by learned coun&s;el, <HI>with all the liberality of the bar,</HI> the court recommended a reference by the parties, <HI>touching all the matters in difference,</HI> under a rule of that court; and it is incumbent on me to acknowledge the high &s;en&s;e of obligation which I entertain, for the readine&s;s with which Jonathan Raine, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> Barri&s;ter at Law, accepted the office of &s;ole arbitrator; and for the patience and per&s;everence he &s;hewed in his attention to a long train of evidence, a tedious arrangement of written pleadings, and a voluminous account. BY THIS REFERENCE I HAD THE HAPPINESS TO EXPERIENCE A FINAL PERIOD PUT TO AN EXPENSIVE LITIGATION.</P>
<P>From an unfortunate mi&s;apprehen&s;ion of the tenor of Mr. Raine's letter to me of the 4th of October, 1793, in the adverti&s;ement I publi&s;hed, informing my &s;ub|&s;cribers, that by the deci&s;ion the property of the work, and the impre&s;&s;ion which remained undi&s;po&s;ed of, were become &s;olely mine, I was led to a&s;&s;ert <HI>that the unreceived &s;ub&s;cription monies were mine;</HI> for which error I have to beg pardon of the public, it being the arbitrator's intention, that all books delivered by Mr. Hodg&s;on previous to the 18th day of October, 1793, &s;hould be paid for to him, and that money to be his property.</P>
<PB N="v" REF="5">
<P>I &s;hould not have troubled my &s;ub&s;cribers and the public with &s;o prolix a &s;tate|ment of facts, but to remove any injurious prejudices, with which their minds might be impre&s;&s;ed by reports; and I flatter my&s;elf they will be convinced, that I was really more than <HI>the reputed author</HI> of the work; and that the delay in the publication did not proceed from me, or had my countenance or a&s;&s;ent.</P>
<P>Every endeavour that I could po&s;&s;ibly exert was u&s;ed to prevent the unfortunate &s;uits in which I was engaged; and thence proceeded the voluntary undertaking I made, for payment of &s;uch expences as &s;hould attend the printing of that part of the work which might overrun the two volumes.</P>
<P>I beg leave in the next place to ob&s;erve, that though <HI>my original propo&s;al</HI> to deliver the third part of the work gratis proceeded &s;olely from a de&s;ire to indem|nify Mr. Hodg&s;on again&s;t an apparent lo&s;s, yet, <HI>in due attention to my &s;ub&s;cribers,</HI> I have re&s;tored the mutilated parts, and replaced what was expunged, &s;o that the hi&s;tories of the pari&s;hes and places between the Tyne and Tees, compri&s;ed in this volume, are printed in their original form. Very few of the &s;ub&s;cribers, who&s;e names appeared in the fir&s;t li&s;t, have withheld their names from the additional li&s;t; and the part which tho&s;e few in number think proper to accept <HI>gratis,</HI> in&s;tead of being delivered in <HI>two hundred</HI> pages, makes up <HI>three hundred</HI> and <HI>fifty-eight</HI> pages, together with many co&s;tly plates.</P>
<P><HI>Since the time</HI> of the deci&s;ion, I have obtained &s;everal valuable pedigrees, given with this volume, and for which I acknowledge my obligations to Sir James Riddell, Bart. Sir I&s;aac Heard, Garter Principal King of Arms, Henry Maire, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> Francis Smyth, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> Mr. Allan, and other corre&s;pondents.</P>
<P>The anecdotes of the di&s;tingui&s;hed prelates, who have departed this life &s;ince the publication of the fir&s;t volume, are drawn from minutes, which, together with the elegant portrait of Dr. Egerton, were obtained lately; and for which I am indebted to gentlemen, who&s;e names, if I was permitted to give them, would add di&s;tinction to the li&s;t of tho&s;e per&s;onages who have done me the honour of their corre&s;pondence.</P>
<P>The account of the <HI>coal</HI> and <HI>lead</HI> trade of this county, which I had prepared as a part of the original manu&s;cript, and had appointed to be in&s;erted under the head of the pari&s;h of Gate&s;head, or of Whickham, Mr. Hodg&s;on withdrew, under an expectation that a friend of his would furni&s;h a complete natural hi&s;tory for this county; that part was not performed; my manu&s;cript on the &s;ubject was un|fortunately mi&s;laid, and was re&s;tored to me imperfect. Thus I was thrown into new labours, and the notes on natural hi&s;tory pre&s;ented in this volume were obtained and compo&s;ed long after the deci&s;ion, and too late to be in&s;erted in any other part of the work.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t I acknowledge with gratitude <HI>the great &s;upport</HI> which this work has received from a large &s;ub&s;cription, and a benevolent public, I mu&s;t &s;till bear the painful reflection, that by the misfortunes which have followed it, and to which I am not con&s;cious in any manner to have contributed, or been acce&s;&s;ary, after <HI>the labours of ten years</HI> in the compilation, I am a &s;ufferer of &s;everal hundred pounds, which the work cannot po&s;&s;ibly reimbur&s;e me.</P>

<HEAD>TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Since the dedication of the fir&s;t volumes of this work (by permi&s;&s;ion) to the Right Rev. Dr. JOHN EGERTON, late Lord Bi&s;hop of Durham, it hath plea&s;ed God to take that excellent and much beloved prelate from this life. As a duty to the public, the following &s;ketch of his character and conduct is offered to them,</HI></P>
<P>BY THE AUTHOR.</P>
<P>JOHN EGERTON,</P>
<P>THE late Bi&s;hop of Durham, was the &s;on of Henry Egerton, Bi&s;hop of Hereford, (fifth &s;on of John, third Earl of Bridgwater, by Lady Jane Powlett, fir&s;t daughter of Charles, Duke of Bolton) who, marrying Lady Elizabeth Ariana Bentinck, daughter of William Earl of Portland, had by her one daughter, and five &s;ons, of whom John was the elde&s;t.</P>
<P>He was born in London on the 30th of November, 1721, O. S. was educated at Eton &s;chool, and admitted a Gentleman Commoner in Oriel College, Oxford, upon the 20th of May, 1740, under the tuition of the Rev. Dr. Bentham, after|wards Regius Profe&s;&s;or of Divinity in that univer&s;ity, where he pro&s;ecuted his &s;tudies exten&s;ively and &s;ucce&s;sfully for &s;ix or &s;even years. He was ordained Deacon privately by Dr. Benjamin Hoadley, Bi&s;hop of Worce&s;ter, in Gro&s;venor Chapel, within the precincts of We&s;tmin&s;ter, on the 21&s;t of Dec. 1745, and the following day he was ordained prie&s;t, at a general ordination holden by the &s;ame bi&s;hop, in the &s;ame place. On the 23d, he was collated by his father to the living of Ro&s;s, in Hereford&s;hire, and on the 28th, was inducted, by Robert Breton, Archdeacon of Hereford. On the 3d of January, 1746, (a &s;hort time before his father's death, which happened on the 1&s;t of April following) he was collated to the Canonry or Prebend of Cublington, in the church of Hereford. Upon the 30th of May, 1746, he took the degree of Bachelor of Civil Law, for which he went out Grand Compounder. On the 21&s;t of November, 1748, he was married to Lady Anne Sophia, daughter of Henry de Grey, Duke of Kent, by Sophia, daughter of William Bentinck, Earl of Portland. He was appointed Chaplain in Ordinary to the King, upon the 19th of March, 1749: and was promoted to the Deanry of Hereford, on the 24th of July, 1750. He was con&s;ecrated Bi&s;hop of Bangor, on the 4th of July, 1756, at Lambeth; and had the temporalties re&s;tored to him upon the 22d, previou&s;ly to which, on the 21&s;t of May, the univer&s;ity of Oxford confer|red upon him the degree of Doctor of Civil Law, by diploma, and he was empow|ered to hold the living of Ro&s;s, and the prebend of Cublington, with that bi&s;hoprick, by commendam, dated the 1&s;t of July. On the 12th of November, 1768, he was tran&s;lated to the &s;ee of Litchfield and Coventry, with which he held the prebend of Weldland, and re&s;identiary&s;hip of St. Paul's, and al&s;o the two
<PB N="iv" REF="7">preferments before mentioned. He was inducted, in&s;talled, and enthroned at Litchfield by proxy, upon the 22d of November, and had the temporalties re&s;tored upon the 26th. On the death of Dr. Richard Trevor, he was elected to the &s;ee of Durham, upon the 8th of July, 1771, and was confirmed on the 20th in St. James's church, We&s;tmin&s;ter. Upon the 2d of Augu&s;t following, he was enthroned and in&s;talled at Durham by proxy. On this occa&s;ion, Dr. Douglas, the Subdean, <Q>&startq;congratulated the chapter and clergy upon their receiving, as &s;ucce&s;&s;or to the late lamented dioce&s;an, a prelate, who&s;e many well-known good qualities of heart and under&s;tanding, and who&s;e line of able and impartial conduct in the dioce&s;es he had left, afforded a &s;ure omen of that &s;teadine&s;s and wi&s;dom of government, which promi&s;ed equally to promote his own honour, and the &endq;pro&s;perity of the whole dioce&s;e.</Q>&mdash;The temporalties of the &s;ee were re&s;tored to his lord&s;hip on the 15th of Augu&s;t, and on the 3d of September he made his public entry into his palatinate.</P>
<P>Though qualified in all re&s;pects to fill this exalted &s;tation, yet, &s;ingular as it may &s;eem, it was never the object of his ambition or de&s;ire. He appeared &s;atisfied with his fir&s;t eccle&s;ia&s;tical preferment, the living of Ro&s;s, upon which he con&s;tantly re&s;ided, di&s;charging all his parochial duties in a manner the mo&s;t exemplary: and &s;o little anxious was he to obtain a &s;eat on the epi&s;copal bench, that he could not be prevailed upon to u&s;e any applications of his own for that purpo&s;e, and, with diffi|culty, permitted tho&s;e of his friends. This la&s;t preferment was un&s;olicited, and unexpected: he had previou&s;ly declined accepting the primacy of Ireland, and never extended his wi&s;hes to the bi&s;hoprick of Durham. Seated here however, he turned his attention to the choice and pur&s;uit of tho&s;e objects, which his judgment and moderation pointed out as mo&s;t likely to conduce to the peace and pro&s;perity of the county, over which he was to pre&s;ide, and to the honour both of his temporal and &s;piritual government. To accompli&s;h this ta&s;k required all the addre&s;s and talent for conciliation, of which he was &s;o completely ma&s;ter. On his taking po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the bi&s;hoprick, he found the county divided by former conte&s;ted elections, which had de&s;troyed the general peace: no endeavours were wanting on his part to promote and &s;ecure a thorough reconciliation of contend|ing intere&s;ts, on terms honourable and advantageous to all; and when the affability, politene&s;s, and conde&s;cen&s;ion, for which he was di&s;tingui&s;hed, meeting in one of his high character and &s;tation, had won the affections of all parties to him&s;elf, he &s;ound le&s;s difficulty in reconciling them to each other, and had &s;oon the high &s;atisfaction to &s;ee men of the fir&s;t di&s;tinction in the county conciliated by his<NOTE PLACE="foot"><HI>"Though qualified in all re&s;pects to fill this exalted &s;tation,"</HI> &amp;c.] This was &s;o generally &s;uppo&s;ed from a review of his preceding conduct, and is &s;o perfectly true, that it will neither be fit to omit mentioning it, nor proper to a&s;cribe our doing &s;o to a de&s;ire of giving his lord&s;hip undue prai&s;e. In all the &s;everal preferments he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, he was beloved, admired, and re&s;pected: but at Ro&s;s, where he lived the longe&s;t, and was the be&s;t known, his pari&s;hioners con&s;idered him not only as their rector, but as their friend, their benefactor, and almo&s;t as their father; and he had &s;o endeared him&s;elf to them, that there was no po&s;&s;ible mark of genuine &s;orrow, public or private, with which they did not, with an admiration almo&s;t enthu&s;ia&s;tic, do ju&s;tice to his virtues, and manife&s;t their own gratitude when he left them.</NOTE>
<PB N="v" REF="8">means, and meeting in good neighbourhood at his princely table. The harmony he had &s;o happily re&s;tored, he was equally &s;tudious to pre&s;erve, which he effectually did, by treating the nobility and gentry of the county at all times with a proper regard, by paying an entire and impartial attention to their native intere&s;ts, by forbearing to improve any opportunities of influencing their parliamentary choice in favour of his own family, or particular friends, and by con&s;ulting, on all occa&s;ions, the honour of the palatinate.</P>
<P>The &s;ame conciliating interpo&s;ition he had u&s;ed in the county, he employed in the city of Durham with the &s;ame &s;ucce&s;s. At the approach of the general election in 1780, he po&s;tponed granting the new charter, which would con&s;iderably enlarge the number of voters, till &s;ome months after the election, that he might maintain the &s;tricte&s;t neutrality between the candidates, and avoid even the im|putation of a partiality; and when he confirmed it, and freely re&s;tored to the city all its ancient rights, privileges, and immunities, in the mo&s;t ample and advanta|geous form, he &s;elected the members of the new corporation, with great care, out of the mo&s;t moderate and re&s;pectable of the citizens, regardle&s;s of every con&s;ide|ration, but its peace and due regulation; objects which he &s;teadily held in view, and in the attainment of which he &s;ucceeded to his utmo&s;t wi&s;h, and far beyond his expectation.</P>
<P>A conduct equally calculated to promote order and good government, he di&s;|played, if po&s;&s;ible, &s;till more con&s;picuou&s;ly, in the &s;piritual than in the temporal deportment of his double office. Towards the chapter, and towards the body of the clergy at large, he exerci&s;ed every good office, making them all look up to him as their common friend and father: and to tho&s;e who had enjoyed the &s;pe|cial favour of his predece&s;&s;or, he was particularly kind and attentive, both from a &s;en&s;e of their merit, and that he might mitigate in &s;ome degree their lo&s;s of &s;o excellent a friend and patron.</P>
<P>In the di&s;charge of all his epi&s;copal functions, he was diligent and con&s;cientious. He was extremely &s;crupulous whom he admitted into holy orders, in re&s;pect of their learning, character, and religious tenets. In his vi&s;itations, he urged and enforced the regularity, the decorum, and the well-being of the church, by a par|ticular enquiry into the conduct of its mini&s;ters, encouraging them to re&s;ide upon their &s;everal benefices, and manife&s;ting, upon all opportunities, a &s;incere and active concern for the intere&s;ts and accommodation of the inferior clergy. His charges were the exact tran&s;cripts of his mind: objections have been made to &s;ome com|po&s;itions of this kind, that they bear the &s;emblance of being as &s;pecious as &s;incere, and are calculated &s;ometimes, perhaps, rather a little more to rai&s;e the reputation of their author, as a fine writer, than to edify the mini&s;try, and advance religion.<NOTE PLACE="foot"><HI>Freely re&s;tored to the city all its ancient rights, privileges, and immunities, in the mo&s;t ample and ad|vantageous "form,"</HI> &amp;c.] His lord&s;hip granted a new charter to the city of Durham upon the 2d of Oct. 1780. See the copy of the charter, and minutes of the proceedings, from page 37 to page 56, of the &s;econd volume of this hi&s;tory.</NOTE>
<PB N="vi" REF="9">Of the charges his lord&s;hip delivered, it may truly be &s;aid, that, upon &s;uch occa|&s;ions, he recommended nothing to his clergy, which he did not practi&s;e in his life, and approve of in his clo&s;et.</P>
<P>Some years before his death, his health not permitting him to go into the more di&s;tant parts of his dioce&s;e, he gave a commi&s;&s;ion to Dr. Law, then Bi&s;hop of Clonfert and Kilmacduagh, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the archdeacon, to vi&s;it and confirm in Northumberland, confining his per&s;onal attendance to the county of Durham.</P>
<P>The preferments in his di&s;po&s;al he gave with a truly pa&s;toral care: with many of them he rewarded the provincial clergy, on account of their learning, and other merits.</P>
<P>In a remarkable in&s;tance, in which he wi&s;hed to prefer a particular friend, he declined indulging his inclination, from a conviction, that the per&s;on he was de&s;irous to promote, was not entirely orthodox in his tenets, making a covenant with him&s;elf, that his affection &s;hould not pre&s;s upon his duty.</P>
<P>The manner and circum&s;tances in which the two valuable pieces of preferment, ***** of Sherborne Ho&s;pital, and ***** the Fir&s;t Stall, were given to their pre&s;ent po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors, evinced, in the one in&s;tance, the di&s;intere&s;ted liberality of the gift, and in the other, the high and &s;acred obligation of a promi&s;e operating upon his mind after the per&s;on to whom it was made had been long dead; at the &s;ame time that, by di&s;appointing the application of an opulent relation, from whom he had expec|tations, his lord&s;hip le&s;&s;ened &s;uch hopes, as otherwi&s;e he might more rea&s;onably have entertained.</P>
<P>The ho&s;pitality which he maintained at Durham and Aukland, well became his birth and &s;tation. Where men &s;hare freely of the luxuries they give, it may be difficult to a&s;&s;ign the motives of the giver, and exactly to a&s;certain how much proceeds from genuine ho&s;pitality, and how much from the love of per&s;onal indulgence. Of his motives, there could be no &s;uch doubt: his temperance re|&s;trained<NOTE PLACE="foot"><HI>"Of Sherborne Ho&s;pital."]</HI> He allowed Dr. Dampier, the late Dean of Durham, to re&s;ign Sherborne Ho&s;pital, when his health was vi&s;ibly declining, in favour of his &s;on, partly to oblige a mutual friend, and partly out of regard to the dean, and the de&s;erved e&s;timation he was held in at Durham.</NOTE> <NOTE PLACE="foot"><HI>"And ***** the Fir&s;t Stall."]</HI> After the Duke of Newea&s;tle's death, the Duche&s;s of Newca&s;tle reque&s;ted his lord&s;hip (at that time Bi&s;hop of Bangor) to prefer Dr. Cooper, if ever it &s;hould be in his power; and he promi&s;ed that he would. Many years after her death, the Fir&s;t Stall became vacant, and he gave it to Dr. Cooper, who did not even expect it would be offered to him. A very near rela|tion of the bi&s;hop's was at that time within a few months of being of age to take prie&s;t's orders, and it might have been kept for him, as an intimate friend of his lord&s;hip's, who was then a dignified clergy|man, and has &s;ince been made a bi&s;hop, offered to hold it, giving a bond of re&s;ignation. His lord&s;hip di&s;approved of bonds of re&s;ignation; but that con&s;ideration did not weigh with him in this particular ca&s;e.
<P>It may here ca&s;ually be ob&s;erved, that no man perhaps ever had a greater aver&s;ion to what in common di&s;cour&s;e is called a job.

His attention, his manners and conver&s;ation gave an additional reli&s;h to the whole, and made the &s;ociety of his hou&s;e complete. In&s;tead of &s;etting apart particular days, as had been cu&s;tomary, his hou&s;e was always open, always filled by his numerous relations and friends, and the nobility, clergy, and principal families of the dioce&s;e.</P>
<P>Such was the wi&s;e oeconomy pre&s;erved by his lord&s;hip, that the expence attend|ing his ho&s;pitality and munificence was no ob&s;truction to his well-directed bene|factions. Be&s;ides many gifts and charities, be&s;towed on indigent clergymen and their families, and other de&s;erving characters in di&s;tre&s;s, with a delicacy that gave them a double value, and which, during his life, where indu&s;triou&s;ly concealed, he continued to his death all the bounties he had annually given in his two former dioce&s;es of Bangor, and of Litchfield and Coventry, as well as all the numerous benefactions of his predece&s;&s;ors at Durham, increa&s;ing tho&s;e to the &s;ons of the clergy, whom he was particularly &s;olicitous to &s;upport, and tho&s;e to the infirmary at Newca&s;tle.</P>
<P>To St. Ann's Chapel, in Aukland, to the &s;chools of Wol&s;ingham, Norton, and many other places, he gave particular benefactions; and, whenever it was practi|cable, he made it a condition of his con&s;ent, upon the inclo&s;ure of wa&s;te lands, that twenty or thirty acres &s;hould be given to the living, where it was &s;mall, over and above the allotment to which it was entitled.</P>
<P>To the county, in general, he was a great benefactor, as well as to the copy|holders in particular. He promoted the inclo&s;ure of Walling Fen in Howden&s;hire, which could never have been accompli&s;hed without his interpo&s;ition, on account of the many oppo&s;ite intere&s;ts concerned in it, by which &s;ix thou&s;and acres were drained and cultivated, and now pre&s;ent the agreeable and u&s;eful pro&s;pect of nu|merous farms and cottages, a new town, and a navigation.</P>
<P>He applied to parliament to exonerate the copyholders of Lanche&s;ter-fell, and Ham&s;teel's-fell, of the lord's right to the timber, a mea&s;ure highly u&s;eful and li|beral; in con&s;equence of which, many trees are planted on a &s;urface of nearly thirty thou&s;and acres, and are become already ornamental to the country, and will in time be u&s;eful to the nation.</P>
<P>He con&s;ented to an act of parliament for infranchi&s;ing certain copyholds, in the manor of Howden&s;hire, for the accommodation and convenience of the tenants, by enabling them to convey their lands, with more ea&s;e and &s;afety, and at the &s;ame time, without prejudice to the lord.</P>
<P>In the great flood of November, 1771, the whole of the bridge over the Tyne, between Newca&s;tle and Gate&s;head, was either &s;wept away, or &s;o much damaged, as to render the taking it down nece&s;&s;ary. Of the expence of re-building it, the &s;ee of Durham was &s;ubject to one third, and the corporation of Newca&s;tle to the<NOTE PLACE="foot"><HI>"Navigation,"</HI> &amp;c.] From Market Weighton to the Humber.</NOTE>
<PB N="viii" REF="11">remainder. Parliament enabled the bi&s;hop to rai&s;e, by life annuities, chargeable upon the &s;ee, a &s;um &s;ufficient for re-building his proportion. The &s;urveyors for the bi&s;hop and corporation di&s;agreeing, the bridge is not rebuilt upon a regular plan, which was &s;o contrary to his lord&s;hip's wi&s;hes, that he offered to advance to the corporation, the amount of his one third, that they might undertake the manage|ment of the whole, and fini&s;h it uniformly; which propo&s;al was not accepted. In the progre&s;s of this bu&s;ine&s;s, he not only con&s;ented, that his expence &s;hould be enlarged, but likewi&s;e that his income &s;hould be dimini&s;hed; for he agreed to the widening of the new bridge, by which the expences of re-building were encrea&s;ed; and then to alleviate the lo&s;&s;es of his tenants, who had hou&s;es on the old bridge, he gave them full lea&s;es for building upon the new, without taking any fine; but as building upon the new bridge would impair the beauty of it, and be an incon|venience to the public, he gave up his own intere&s;ts in the &s;ites of the hou&s;es, on condition, that his tenants &s;hould have an equivalent on another &s;pot, upon agree|ing not to build upon the new bridge; and he then procured it to be enacted by parliament, that no hou&s;es &s;hould, in future, be built upon the new bridge, though the renewal of the lea&s;es of the buildings that otherwi&s;e might have been erected thereon, would have produced him a con&s;iderable income.</P>
<P>The important rights of property, which had been long in di&s;pute between the &s;ee and the re&s;pectable family of Clavering, were brought, by his means, to an amicable conclu&s;ion; and the rights of boundary, which his predece&s;&s;ors had long been litigating, were fully a&s;certained: and when, by authority of parliament, he granted a lea&s;e of the e&s;tates in que&s;tion, for three lives, he gave the fine he re|ceived for the lea&s;e to his le&s;&s;ee of the mines, in con&s;ideration of the expences which were formerly incurred by him in defending the right.</P>
<P>It may truly be con&s;idered as no &s;mall proof of his moderation, that, notwith|&s;tanding, for nearly &s;eventeen years, he held the bi&s;hoprick of Durham, in which the rights of property are &s;o various and exten&s;ive, the per&s;ons with whom he had to tran&s;act bu&s;ine&s;s &s;o numerous, and in their expectations, perhaps, not always rea&s;onable, he had, during the whole cour&s;e of that time, but one law-&s;uit: and though there are in the&s;e times, certainly no improper prejudices in favour of the claims of the church, that law-&s;uit was, by a jury of the county, determined in his favour. It was in&s;tituted to prevent the <HI>onus</HI> of repairing the road between Aukland-park, and the river Wear, from being fixed upon his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, to who&s;e intere&s;ts he was always properly attentive.</P>
<P>He adju&s;ted the quota of the land-tax, of the e&s;tates in London, belonging to the &s;ee, procuring to him&s;elf and his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, an abatement of 13-20ths of what had before been unduly paid; and he greatly increa&s;ed the rents of the epi&s;copal de|me&s;nes at Stockton.</P>
<P>His additions and improvements at the epi&s;copal palaces, offices and grounds, did equal credit to his ta&s;te and liberality. Exclu&s;ive of &s;uch as he made in the ca&s;tle and offices at Durham, by &s;itting up the great breakfa&s;t room, now u&s;ed as a drawing-room; and by enlarging and repairing the &s;tables, and their dependen|cies; at Auckland ca&s;tle, where he chiefly re&s;ided, his improvements were equally
<PB N="ix" REF="12">well judged, and much more various and expen&s;ive. At the north ea&s;t entrance of Aukland deme&s;ne, which, in the approach from Durham, opens the exten&s;ive and magnificent &s;cene of the park and ca&s;tle, he built a porter's lodge and a gateway, and ornamented the&s;e with large plantations: and the new apartments at the &s;outh of the ca&s;tle, which were begun by his predece&s;&s;ors, he completed, and made into a magnificent &s;uit of rooms. The great room he fitted up, and new furni&s;hed the chapel. The &s;teward's hou&s;e, as well as the offices and &s;tables, he enlarged, repaired, and altered into regular buildings; and he lowered the walls of the court and bowling-green, to the great beauty of the &s;cenery from the hou&s;e. With the monies ari&s;ing from the &s;ale of the rents and fines in Howden&s;hire, he bought the Park clo&s;es, the Haver clo&s;es, and other grounds adjoining to the park, with &s;ome hou&s;es and tenements in Aukland; he con&s;iderably extended the park wall, intending to continue it round the whole: the kitchen garden he greatly en|larged, and &s;ecured it by a &s;tone pier from the river Gaunle&s;s: he built another &s;tone pier and wall, to cover part of the park from the ravages of the river Wear; he embanked again&s;t the Gaunle&s;s in its whole cour&s;e through the park, and form|ed in it many beautiful falls. He ornamented the park and deme&s;ne lands with various plantations, draining and improving the whole with much judgment, and e&s;pecially the park farm, which he inclo&s;ed. All the grounds he kept in the very neate&s;t order, employing the olde&s;t and mo&s;t indigent per&s;ons in the neighbour|hood. In Bedbourne wood, he cut &s;everal walks and ridings, and totally rebuilt the lodge-hou&s;e and farm, which pre&s;ents a beautiful object to the ca&s;tle.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding all the&s;e expences, he was liberal and indulgent to his tenants, remitting many fines, and taking no more than one year's rent for a renewal of &s;even years, or one life: attempts, however, were &s;ometimes made to abu&s;e his lenity and indulgence.</P>
<P>He di&s;charged all the duties of his high and arduous &s;tation, with a &s;teadine&s;s that was very remarkable: he not only knew what was right, but acted conform|ably to that knowledge: though he &s;et a proper value upon the opinions of man|kind, no man was le&s;s under the influence of vain popularity; and when, upon reflection, he had thoroughly &s;atisfied his own mind, regardle&s;s of the world and the world's law, he would never &s;uffer the prejudices of others to &s;uper&s;ede, and cancel the higher obligations of what he conceived to be his duty. This firmne&s;s of di&s;po&s;ition, advantageous in &s;o many points of view, fitted him peculiarly for the admini&s;tration of the great and various powers, with which he was entru&s;ted.</P>
<P>It is not always, that men di&s;tingui&s;hed in public, appear to advantage in their private characters. We &s;hall con&s;ider the life of our late prelate in both the&s;e<NOTE PLACE="foot"><HI>"Attempts were &s;ometimes made to abu&s;e his lenity and indulgence."]</HI> A gentleman applied to his lord&s;hip to exchange a life, which he &s;tated to be a very good one, and &s;aid, that the rea&s;on which induced him to make this reque&s;t, was merely that he had a quarrel with the man, and wi&s;hed to have nothing to do, even with his name: whereas the fact was, that the quarrel, if ever it had taken place, was certainly made up; and the man, who&s;e life in the lea&s;e was de&s;ired to be exchanged, was dying, and was attended by a phy&s;ician at the expence of the le&s;&s;ee.</NOTE>
<PB N="x" REF="13">views; and each will throw a lu&s;tre upon the other. In the following &s;ketch, we mean to delineate &s;uch &s;elect traits only, as are not common to all other men, but were more peculiar in him.</P>
<P>His per&s;on was tall and well formed, it had both elegance and &s;trength; his countenance was ingenuous, animated, and engaging. By nature, he was endowed with &s;trong and lively parts, a good temper, and an active di&s;po&s;ition. De&s;cended from noble ance&s;tors, and initiated, from his birth, in the mo&s;t honourable con|nections, his manners and &s;entiments were ca&s;t, from an early age, in the happie&s;t mould, and gave all the advantages of that ea&s;e and propriety of behaviour, which were &s;o very ob&s;ervable, even in the mo&s;t indifferent actions of his life.</P>
<P>In his addre&s;s, there was a peculiar mixture of dignity and affability, by which he had the remarkable art, both of encouraging tho&s;e who were diffident, and checking tho&s;e who were pre&s;umptuous.</P>
<P>The vivacity of his &s;pirits and conver&s;ation, and the peculiar propriety of his manners, made him univer&s;ally admired and care&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>His memory was accurate and exten&s;ive. In de&s;cribing the characters, and in relating the anecdotes and tran&s;actions with which he had been acquainted, he took particular delight; and this, when his health permitted, he did with much &s;pirit; and often with the utmo&s;t plea&s;antry and humour, but &s;crupulou&s;ly taking care, that the de&s;ire of ornamenting any narrative, &s;hould never, in the &s;malle&s;t degree, induce him to depart from the truth of it. With &s;o rare and happy a talent for de&s;cription, with a mind &s;tored with much information, and a memory very retentive, he was one of the mo&s;t in&s;tructive and entertaining of companions: his conver&s;ation was enriched with pertinent and u&s;eful ob&s;ervations, and enlivened by genuine wit, and humorous anecdote.</P>
<P>He had a very peculiar art of extricating him&s;elf, with much immediate addre&s;s, from tho&s;e little embarra&s;&s;ments which perplex and confound many, and which often occur in &s;ociety from the awkwardne&s;s of others, or from a concurrence of &s;ingular and unexpected circum&s;tances. When pre&s;&s;ed by improper que&s;tions, in&s;tead of being offended with them him&s;elf, or giving offence by his replies, he had a talent of returning very ready, and very dexterous an&s;wers.</P>
<P>In every &s;ort of emergency, as well in per&s;onal danger, as in difficulties of an inferior nature, he &s;hewed an uncommon pre&s;ence of mind. He po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a great reach of under&s;tanding, and was &s;ingularly gifted with a quick and ready judgment,<NOTE PLACE="foot"><HI>"When pre&s;&s;ed by improper que&s;tions,"</HI> &amp;c.] The following are two in&s;tances, among the many that might be alluded to:&mdash;To a gentleman who indulged rather an unnece&s;&s;ary curio&s;ity, in inquiring of him what he inherited from his father? what was his wife's fortune? and what was the value of his living of Ro&s;s? He an&s;wered to the fir&s;t que&s;tion, "not &s;o much as he expected;" to the &s;econd, "not as much as was reported;" and to the third, "more than he made of it."
<P>A gentleman requiring of him the renewal of a lea&s;e, upon terms far &s;hort of its real value, and the bi&s;hop refu&s;ing, the gentleman a&s;&s;igned as a rea&s;on, why the propo&s;al ought to be accepted, that his lord|&s;hip was in &s;uch a declining &s;tate of health, as to render his life very precarious, implying that it was very improbable he &s;hould live long: upon this the bi&s;hop very readily remarked, <Q>Since that was the &startq;ca&s;e, the gentleman mu&s;t be convinced, that his own intere&s;t was but a &s;econdary con&s;ideration to him, &endq;and his principal object mu&s;t be, to do no injury to his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors.</Q></P></NOTE>
<PB N="xi" REF="14">deciding rightly upon the in&s;tant when it was nece&s;&s;ary. No man was better qualified, or at the &s;ame time more aver&s;e to deliver his opinion; which, upon many occa&s;ions, he found a difficulty in avoiding, its value being &s;o well known, that it was often &s;olicited by his friends; and, when he was prevailed upon, he did it rather with the humility of one who a&s;ked, than with the authority of one who gave advice.</P>
<P>In forming his friend&s;hips, he was as cautious as he was &s;teady and uniform in adhering to them. He was extremely partial to the friend&s;hips of his youth, and made a particular point of being u&s;eful to tho&s;e, with whom he had been thus early connected.</P>
<P>It is remarkable, that there did not, upon any occa&s;ion, exi&s;t in his mind, the lea&s;t de&s;ire of revenge. Men who are open and entire in their friend&s;hips, are commonly &s;o in their enmities; with him it was otherwi&s;e; for, though not with|out a &s;en&s;e of injuries, he was at all times forgiving. Happy in this di&s;po&s;ition, his re&s;entments of cour&s;e were &s;hort, and his friend&s;hips la&s;ting.</P>
<P>In all the dome&s;tic relations of life, he was exemplary as a hu&s;band, a ma&s;ter, and a parent. In&s;tead of holding over his children, an authority founded upon intere&s;t, during his life, he put them into po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a great part of &s;uch fortunes, as they would have inherited from him upon his death, willing to have their obe|dience proceed, not merely from a &s;en&s;e of duty, but from gratitude, and from pure di&s;intere&s;ted affection.</P>
<P>Of civil, political, and religious liberty, he had formed ju&s;t notions, and was firmly attached to the con&s;titution in church and &s;tate.</P>
<P>He had an exten&s;ive knowledge both of men and things, of which he &s;tudiou&s;ly avoided any di&s;play. It may be &s;aid with the utmo&s;t truth, that in every action of his life, however de&s;erving of prai&s;e, he rather declined, than courted it; and whenever any thing that had a tendency to his commendation was accidentally in|troduced into conver&s;ation, either by his friends or dependants, he appeared &s;o far from thinking it his due, rather to &s;u&s;pect the one of partiality, and the other of flattery. This aver&s;ion to &s;how and parade, ran through the whole of his character, &s;o much that the &s;everal public appearances and proce&s;&s;ions his &s;tation required, which might be con&s;idered as a part, and to many would have been a plea&s;ing part of their duty, were irk&s;ome to him. The &s;ame freedom from o&s;tentation was ob&s;ervable, with regard to his literary endowments, and from that motive, as well as from his abhorrence of controver&s;y, and perhaps, al&s;o from a conviction that there were already too many writers, he was ever di&s;inclined to<NOTE PLACE="foot"><HI>"Deciding rightly upon the in&s;tant,"</HI> &amp;c.] <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">.

<P>In the early part of his life he was fond of tho&s;e manly exerci&s;es which give &s;trength and vigour both to the body and mind, without &s;uffering them to inter|rupt his &s;tudies: a practice which, thus regulated, in&s;tead of being injurious, is &s;erviceable to learning, and which men, eminent for their judgment, have lamented was not more cultivated and improved. His u&s;ual relaxations were &s;uch as yet exerci&s;ed the under&s;tanding: che&s;s was his favourite amu&s;ement, and he played well at that game. The Greek and Latin tongues were familiar to him, but he delighted mo&s;t in the Greek. He &s;poke the French and Italian languages; and wrote and &s;poke his own with purity and preci&s;ion. Of books he had a competent knowledge, and collected a good library. In every thing he had a pure ta&s;te.&mdash;In hi&s;tory, anecdotes, and memoirs, in the <HI>belles-lettres,</HI> in the arts and &s;ciences, and in whatever el&s;e may be &s;uppo&s;ed to fall within the circle of polite education, he was by no means unin&s;tructed.</P>
<P>But the feature which in him was as prominent as it is lovely, was a perfect union of dignity and humility. In &s;ociety, with per&s;ons of his own rank, he maintained his equality; and in his intercour&s;e with the inferior ranks of men, who&s;e vice did not forbid, he &s;tooped with the utmo&s;t conde&s;cen&s;ion to the lowe&s;t. To all who had any bu&s;ine&s;s or concerns with him, he was acce&s;&s;ible and &s;incerely affable, and more e&s;pecially to the inferior clergy.</P>
<P>Benevolent to man, and reverent towards God, he con&s;idered him&s;elf in the comprehen&s;ive view of one bound by the tie of fraternity to all men; and his whole conduct be&s;poke him only ambitious, as far as human frailty will permit, of humbly imitating HIM, who is the pattern of all. By good works, he mani|fe&s;ted the &s;incerity of his faith: "True religion," &s;aid he, in one of his di&s;cour&s;es, <Q>&startq;con&s;i&s;ts in the love of God, and the love of our neighbour; not in an empty profe&s;&s;ion of love to God, but in &s;uch a love as will manife&s;t it&s;elf by faith, obedience, and adoration; and in &s;uch a love of our neighbour, as mu&s;t prove it&s;elf to be undi&s;&s;embled, di&s;intere&s;ted, and productive of all &s;ocial virtues. But let us never be unmindful," continued he, "that the fir&s;t and great duty is the love of God, or piety; for it is this which mu&s;t give life and &s;pirit to the per|formance of every other duty: in fine, it is this which exalts our morality into Chri&s;tianity, and it is Chri&s;tianity alone which can entitle us to a la&s;ting &endq;happine&s;s.</Q></P>
<P>His health had been declining for many years, and though he was neither &s;o old nor &s;o infirm as to look upon death as a relea&s;e, he lived as if he hourly expected it; &s;triving however to pre&s;erve life by every proper means, valuing the gift, and<NOTE PLACE="foot"><HI>"By &s;uch of his friends as were them&s;elves di&s;tingui&s;hed by their erudition."]</HI> Among&s;t many others, we may name Archbi&s;hop Secker, Ben&s;on Bi&s;hop of Glouce&s;ter, Butler Bi&s;hop of Durham, the late Lord Lyttleton, the late Lord Egremont, the late Mr. George Grenville, Mr. William Gerard Flamilton, Mr. An&s;ty, Mr. Richard Owen Cambridge, Mr. Garrick, Mr. Stilling&s;leet, Mr. J.

<HEAD>LIFE OF BISHOP THURLOW.</HEAD>
<P>WE have al&s;o to lament, that during the delays which have attended this publication, THE RIGHT REVEREND THOMAS THURLOW, D. D. who &s;ucceeded Dr. EGERTON in the &s;ee of Durham, departed this life, after hold|ing his promotion from the &s;ee of Lincoln little more than four years.</P>
<P>BISHOP THURLOW was de&s;cended of a Suffolk family, and was the &s;econd brother of the late Lord Chancellor of England. He received his academical education at Oxford, and was one of the fellows of Magdalen College; we are uncertain to what church preferments, he was in&s;tituted before receiving an appointment by the king, in 1771, to the valuable rectory of Stanhope, in this county, which had then become vacant by the promotion of Edward Keene, as noted in its place in this volume.</P>
<P>Few opportunities offered for DR. THURLOW to di&s;play the virtues and benevo|lence of his mind as a parochial mini&s;ter; the ma&s;ter&s;hip of the Temple, given him in 1773, and afterwards the deanry of Roche&s;ter, in 1777, called his attention to more exten&s;ive duties under tho&s;e appointments: yet the excellence of his character was but a &s;hort time exerci&s;ed in tho&s;e departments, before he was con|&s;ecrated Bi&s;hop of Lincoln, which dignity was conferred upon him in 1779; and therewith he held the deanry of St. Paul's.</P>
<P>Dr. Egerton's death, on the 18th day of January, 1787, opened the way for that high preferment, which our late prelate po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed for &s;o very &s;hort a period. He expre&s;&s;ed, on all occa&s;ions, his ta&s;te for tho&s;e rural plea&s;ures which &s;urrounded him in this palatinate, and he projected many improvements to be made in his epi&s;copal palaces. He laid down certain maxims for the encouragement of his lea&s;eholders; and was ready, on every occa&s;ion that offered, to promote the intere&s;t and welfare of his people.</P>
<P>It was remarked of him, that "when he was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of an exten&s;ive patronage in the dioce&s;e of Lincoln, he was anxious to &s;eek out, and un&s;olicited, to relieve indigent merit." His power of indulging tho&s;e generous feelings of the mind, whil&s;t at Lincoln, was re&s;trained to the &s;hort period of eight years;&mdash;a much &s;horter in the opulent &s;ee of Durham. He had not an opportunity to grant many promotions in this bi&s;hoprick, but the few in number which were derived from him were di&s;pen&s;ed with great propriety and judgment. In the di&s;charge of his official duty, he was zealous for the promotion of the true faith and of pure morality; in both &s;ees was &s;aid to be a vigilant in&s;pector of the manners and con|duct of his clergy, and a &s;trenuous maintainer of the di&s;cipline of the church.</P>
<P>The bi&s;hop was allowed by all men to po&s;&s;e&s;s a large &s;hare of tho&s;e mental abilities which have di&s;tingui&s;hed his family; his comprehen&s;ion was quick and
<PB N="xvi" REF="18">exten&s;ive, his judgment &s;ound, and his elocution manly and graceful. Having reaped the advantages of an excellent education, with powerful talents, highly cultivated, his diffidence was remarkable; for, from a &s;ingular delicacy of mind, he was not accu&s;tomed to exert him&s;elf in public, whereby tho&s;e ea&s;y manners, and that elegant and refined conver&s;ation which &s;hone in private life, were not di&s;played in more popular &s;ituations. Tho&s;e who were about his per&s;on uniformly &s;peak of him with reverence: his family and friends have &s;uffered an ine&s;timable lo&s;s in his death: per&s;ons connected with him in his epi&s;copal capacity, or who were honoured with his private intimacies, found him an attentive dioce&s;an, a generous patron, a judicious advi&s;er, an agreeable companion, and a &s;incere friend.</P>
<P>The prelate died at his hou&s;e in Portland Place, London, in the fifty-ninth year of his age, univer&s;ally regretted: his lady &s;upported the &s;orrows of her melancholy &s;eparation but a few months.</P>

<P>GEN. VII. A.

Thus never was the origin of any family better a&s;certained.<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">The &s;irname of the family is to be found &s;pelt various ways, as, <HI>Ridel, Riddell, Rydel, Rudel,</HI> &amp;c. and with the Latin termination, <HI>Ridellus, Rydellus, Rudellus,</HI> or &s;ometimes <HI>Ridelli, Rydelli, Rudelli.</HI> A variety of in&s;tances might be mentioned, taken both from Engli&s;h and French authors; but we &s;hall here &s;tate only the authority of Rymer's Faedera, as being expre&s;s with regard to the point, and well known to Engli&s;h readers. There we find that the Ridels of Blaye, the de&s;cendants of Galfridus, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the &s;ame lands which he held, and retaining not only his &s;irname, but al&s;o his chri&s;tian name of Galfridus, have their names written in this indi&s;criminate manner.

<P>It may be here proper to take notice of a very &s;ingular error into which &s;ome Scotch genealogi&s;ts have lately fallen. The family of Ridel has been by them mi&s;takingly con&s;idered as the &s;ame with another of the &s;irname of De Ridale. Accordingly they have blended together and confounded the hi&s;tory of both.</P>
<P><HI>De Ridale</HI> is evidently a local &s;irname, and has its origin from the di&s;trict of that name in York&s;hire. This might have been very &s;afely pre&s;umed, without farther evidence: but &s;uch is not wanting; for the fact is confirmed by hi&s;tory and records. Per&s;ons of that name were &s;ettled in Ridale, in York&s;hire, as early as the middle of the twefth century. One of them, Walter de Ridale, it appears, went into Scot|land, at the time that David I. &s;overeign of that kingdom, brought the monks of Riveaux, in Ridale, to &s;ettle them at Melros, in Roxborough&s;hire; and there acquired the lands of Lili&s;leaf, in the &s;ame county. The de&s;cendants of this Walter, as well as him&s;elf, retained po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions at the &s;ame time both in Ridale and Roxborough&s;hire; &s;o that the origin of the family is clear beyond di&s;pute. Vide Burton's Mona&s;ticon Eboracen&s;e; Chartulary of Riveaux among Cotton's MSS. and compare Rot. Eboracen&s;e 5. Ric. 1.58, 68. ap. Madox's Hi&s;t. Exchequer, p. 67, re&s;pecting the lands of Brachebe held by Patricius de Ridale, with Sir Robert Douglas's account of the family in his Baronage of Scotland.</P>
<P>When particles before &s;irnames came to be aboli&s;hed about the middle of the fifteenth century, the &s;irname of De Ridale pa&s;&s;ed into that of this family; the &s;ound being completely the &s;ame. This cir|cum&s;tance, and one or two others that might be mentioned, furni&s;hes an apology for the mi&s;takes of the Scotch genealogi&s;ts above alluded to.</P>
<P>Another branch of this family of De Ridale, be&s;ide that of Lili&s;leaf, in Scotland, &s;ettled at Berwick upon Tweed. Philip de Ridale was mayor of that town, and office which was then of great importance, in the reign of King Kdward I. Whether he was the chief of all the family of De Ridale, or whether he was of a younger branch, we know not; but it &s;eems probable that the honourable family, the Riddells, of Swinburn Ca&s;tle, are his de&s;cendants.</P></NOTE></P>

<P>This is the Sir William Ridel, who, on account of his being Con&s;table of Barnard Ca&s;tle, has &s;erved as the occa&s;ion of this &s;hort ab&s;tract of the hi&s;tory of the family of Ridel being introduced in this place. As the tran&s;actions in which Sir William was engaged relate to this county, and as they &s;hew not only, that a branch of this family was &s;ettled in it at this early period, but that they held a di&s;tin|gui&s;hed rank, a few particulars de&s;erve that notice here, which tho&s;e concerning other Ridels, &s;till more eminent, have not found in this narrative, intended, as it is, to give merely an ab&s;tract of the de&s;cents.</P>
<P>Before being Con&s;table of Barnard Ca&s;tle, Sir William was Con&s;table of the Ca&s;tle of Norham, being con&s;tituted &s;uch by Richard Kellow, Bi&s;hop of Durham, as well as bailiff of all his lands, &amp;c. belonging to it; but we are unable to deter|mine the preci&s;e year. In 1312, the very fir&s;t year of his being bi&s;hop, that prelate, as appears by a charter in the College of Arms, granted him &s;everal in|dulgences with re&s;pect to Norham. He freed him from paying &s;uit of court, and all ca&s;tle-rent that &s;hould be due to him during his life. At the &s;ame time he agreed to render him the &s;um of ten pounds yearly, as one of his knights.</P>
<P>When Bi&s;hop Kellow &s;urrendered Norham Ca&s;tle to Edward II. for the term of three years, in order that it might be the means of better defending the marches, that prince entru&s;ted the important charge of it to Sir William Ridel, as the bi&s;hop had done.<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Record.

<P>In the year 1315, Sir William was appointed High Sheriff of Northumberland. To this office was al&s;o annexed the governor&s;hip of Newca&s;tle. After this he was con&s;tituted Con&s;table of Barnard Ca&s;tle. In the year 1321, King Edward II. who &s;eems to have held him in high e&s;teem, addre&s;&s;es him as con&s;table of this ca&s;tle, and at the &s;ame time Andrew de Harcla, and &s;ome others, as &s;heriffs and com|manders in the northern parts, to be ready to co-operate with all the forces they could mu&s;ter again&s;t the in&s;urgents. The great &s;ervices per&s;ormed by them, and their &s;teady attachment, it is well known, enabled Edward completely to cru&s;h

<P>Sir William was employed on &s;everal important occa&s;ions by King Edward. In 1318, he was joined in commi&s;&s;ion with two others, to cau&s;e forty tons of wine to be di&s;tributed to the knights, and other per&s;ons of the county of Northumber|berland, having &s;u&s;tained lo&s;&s;es, by rea&s;on of the incur&s;ion of the Scots. In 1320, his maje&s;ty, by a writ directed to Sir William, delegates to him the power of admitting to peace any of the Scotch, who &s;hould be willing to return to their allegiance, provided they gave proper &s;ecurity for their good conduct in future. David Earl of Athol, and Andrew de Harcla, were each inve&s;ted with the like powers. The following year Sir William, with Gilbert de Boroughdon, John de Penreth, and Roger de Hor&s;ley, were empowered all three, or any two of them, to grant letters patent for a &s;afe-conduct to John de Pilmor, who was expected to come to treat on the part of the Scotch king.</P>
<P>When King Edward III. mounted the throne, he placed no le&s;s confidence in Sir William, who&s;e fidelity to his father had been &s;o con&s;picuous. In the very fir&s;t year of his reign, he commi&s;&s;ioned him, with four others (Henry de Perci, of the noble family of Northumberland, was one) to cau&s;e the terms of the truce with Scotland to be faithfully ob&s;erved, and to &s;ee that the offenders &s;hould be puni&s;hed.<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Rymer's Faedera, t. iii. p. 742, p. 862, p. 865, and t. iv. p. 216.</NOTE> Sir William, however, did not live long to enjoy the favour of his &s;overeign, for he died the following year, A.

To the&s;e endeavours, his great influence, both in England and Scotland, gave &s;ucce&s;s, as it procured him the concurrence and a&s;&s;i&s;tance of &s;ome of the mo&s;t eminent men at that time, and particularly that worthy nobleman, the Earl of Crawford and Lind&s;ay, who, in one manufactory, joined with him in the partner&s;hip. Being a man of the mo&s;t liberal &s;pirit, he was equally re&s;pected, during the time of the commonwealth, and afterwards under the newly e&s;tabli&s;hed monarchical government. For &s;ome time he was Commi&s;&s;ary General to the parliament's forces in Scotland.

<P>IN the time of Cutheard, bi&s;hop of Che&s;ter, Tilred redeemed South-Eden, and gave one half of it to the church of Durham to be a monk in that mona&s;tery, and the other to Norton to become abbot there. Regnald having u&s;urped the crown of Northumberland, his generals, Scala and Onlafbal, &s;eized on the territory be|tween Eden and Billingham, and afflicted the inhabitants with grievous exactions.</P>
<P>Robert de Brus becoming po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of Ca&s;tle Eden, gave it to the prior and convent of Gi&s;burne, on condition that in ten years time a chapel &s;hould be built and endowed<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rudd's MSS.</NOTE>. William de S. Barbara, bi&s;hop of Durham, afterwards demi&s;ed half of the tithe to Gi&s;burne convent; and Ivo, &s;on of Adam de Seton, gave the manor of Ca&s;tle Eden in the time of bi&s;hop Farnham<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Vide Hartlepool for the record of confirmation.</NOTE>, which Peter, &s;on of Peter de Brus confirmed; by virtue of which grants the prior and convent enjoyed this place till their &s;uppre&s;&s;ion, and made this church a donative or curacy, (for the re|gi&s;ters do not &s;hew that ever the bi&s;hop of Durham gave in&s;titution to it) and &s;o it continued till the di&s;&s;olution; after which king Henry VIII. in the thirty-third year of his reign, pre&s;ented to this church as to a vicarage<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Thomas Claxton, in the 5th of bi&s;hop Booth, died &s;ei&s;ed of lands held of the priory of St John of Jeru|&s;alem, and four me&s;&s;uages and two oxgangs of land, held of the priory of Durham.

<P>Mr Burdon has lately rebuilt Ca&s;tle Eden hou&s;e on an elegant and exten&s;ive plan; the &s;ituation is elevated, and commands a good land and &s;ea pro&s;pect.

You enter it through a gateway and portico under the tower, ad|joining to which is a gallery for the proprietor's family. The nave and chancel are remarkably neat and well lighted; the forms, for there are no &s;talls, are cover|ed with &s;carlet cloth. The font is of beautiful marble, the ba&s;on of which is oval; neatne&s;s and not ornament hath been attended to in this pious work; touching which a humble memorial is in&s;cribed on a tablet of marble in the ve&s;try-room. The ground round the church is kept in the exacte&s;t garden neatne&s;s. There are &s;ome deep and woody vales or deans near this man&s;ion, which afford many picture&s;que land&s;capes: In one point of view from the &s;outhward, where the church and man&s;ion-hou&s;e are both taken into the land&s;cape, the &s;cene is &s;ingularly beautiful<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Ca&s;tle Eden curacy.&mdash;Prior of Gi&s;burne pr.

<P>The manor of <HI>Lirtington</HI> or <HI>Lartington</HI> in Richmond&s;hire, in the North Riding of the county of York, belonged, in the time of William the Con|queror, to <HI>Bodin</HI> who held Rumbaldkirk, and other great e&s;tates in tho&s;e parts under <HI>Allan,</HI> Earl of Richmond.

<P>The male line of this family is extinct: The la&s;t named Brian in the epitaph left two &s;ons, Robert and Brian; the younger an officer in the 4th regiment of dragoons. Robert, LL.

He was a man of bright genius, highly ac|compli&s;hed in polite literature, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a mo&s;t &s;ocial vein of affability and good humour, joined with an elegant per&s;on and graceful carriage.</P>

<P><HI>Randal's MSS.</HI></P></NOTE>, from which incident it is vulgarly apprehended the place took its name, as here the Danes were trimmed and &s;horn for the religious ceremony. There is a chapel at Trimdon, formerly appendant to Kelloe. Bi&s;hop William de Sancta Barbara, with the con&s;ent of his chapter, gave this church to Gui&s;burn priory about the year 1146, and bi&s;hop
<PB N="15" REF="67">Richard Poore, with like con&s;ent, gave the manor to that priory in fee and per|petual alms, which was confirmed by the king. In 1311 bi&s;hop Kellaw confirmed both the gifts. After the di&s;&s;olution, the manor and patronage of the chapel were &s;old out, and became the e&s;tate of the Ropers, who had their family man&s;ion hou&s;e there; and Robert Roper, <ABBR>e&s;q</ABBR> who died in 1687, &s;old the manor, with its ap|pendages, to John Woodifield, of Fi&s;hburn, <ABBR>e&s;q</ABBR> ance&s;tor of Woodifield Beckwith, of Donca&s;ter, the pre&s;ent owner.

<HEAD>The Pari&s;h of <HI>HART.</HI></HEAD>
<P>The next adjoining pari&s;h towards the ea&s;t is Hart, within which lie the town and port of Hartlepool. Their hi&s;tory is &s;o connected, that we mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily take them together. We are left uninformed when Hartlepool fir&s;t grew into con&s;equence, and to whom it anciently belonged, except only what is found in the Chronicle of Lindisfarn, and quoted in Lambard's Dictionary, p. 145. <Q>Heort|ne&s;&s;e, &startq;a town in the north partes, which Ecgred, bi&s;hop of the holy I&s;le, builded and gave to the &s;ee for ever, together with another called Wycliffe, and &s;ome|what &endq;before Eardulf fled the I&s;le.</Q> We are told by Bede, and other church authorities, that the holy woman Bega, under the au&s;pices of the pious bi&s;hop Aidan, after &s;etling a &s;hort time at Weremouth, cho&s;e to e&s;tabli&s;h a religious foundation here for her own &s;ex, about the year 640; but whether the &s;ituation &s;he fixed upon was near the &s;ea &s;hore, or further up the country, is left to con|jecture. The two names of this place found in ancient writers are Heortu, or Heorthu, and Herutey, which commentators agree &s;ignify Hartland, or the I&s;le of Harts; and perhaps the pre&s;ent penin&s;ula was in former times compleatly in&s;ulated by the tide at high water, through artificial means, and being covered with a fore&s;t, was the peculiar haunt of deer. Under the title Hartlepoole, Tanner's words are, <Q>At or near this place was the ancient mona&s;tery called Heorthu, &startq;founded upon the fir&s;t conver&s;ion of the Northumbrians to Chri&s;tianity, about A. D. 640, by a religious woman named Hieu, or as &s;ome copies have it, St &endq;Bega, whereof St Hilda was &s;ome time abbe&s;s.</Q> The &s;cite of the hou&s;e is not pointed out by any ancient name remaining to us: The pious foundre&s;s cho&s;e the &s;ea &s;hore in Copeland, and the like at Weremouth, whence a conjecture may rea|&s;onably be grounded, that &s;he followed the &s;ame affection here. St Hilda was her &s;ucce&s;&s;or, and here Eanfleda, the devoted daughter of O&s;wi, was received in con|&s;equence of her father's holy vow. We are al&s;o ignorant of the length of time this hou&s;e flouri&s;hed, or when it fell into decay; the great &s;troke which perhaps<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vide Bedae Hi&s;t.

<P>In the beginning of the la&s;t century, when the privilege of &s;ending repre&s;enta|tives to parliament was di&s;cu&s;&s;ed, Hartlepool was de&s;cribed as being the only port town within the county, (A.

<PB N="25" REF="77">
<P>There are few places in this kingdom give the traveller &s;o perfect an idea of the fortifications of former times as Hartlepool; a long extended wall &s;trengthened by demi-ba&s;tions at intervals, &s;ome rounded, others &s;quare; various gates and &s;allyports, &s;ecured by machicolations and the portcullis; &s;ome of the gates defend|ed by angular, others &s;quare turrets; all the variety appearing, which had grown into u&s;e in that age. As the wall runs along the edge of the creek, behind the
<PB N="26" REF="78">point of land which projects it&s;elf into the &s;ea, and from thence turns to cro&s;s the i&s;thmus to the oppo&s;ite cliff, the figure it forms is not regular, giving fir&s;t a triangle, and then running with a &s;weep or bend north and ea&s;tward. At the <HI>ne&s;s end,</HI> or north ea&s;t point of the wall to the &s;ea, it fini&s;hed with an acute angle, ri&s;ing on the brow of lofty rocks: The foundation has of late years been wa&s;ted by the wa&s;hing of the waves, and that part of the wall is now gone: It was exact|ly &s;imilar to the ne&s;s or point of the Roman wall oppo&s;ite to the ca&s;tle of Car|li&s;le. For a con&s;iderable &s;pace from the &s;ea the wall is much broken, and at the di&s;tance of about twenty paces are the remains of a &s;quare ba&s;tion; from thence about forty paces is a round ba&s;tion, projecting from the wall about two thirds of a circle, in girt nearly thirty feet: In the front of this ba&s;tion, at the di&s;tance of about five yards, is a high ridge of earth, probably ca&s;t up by a&s;&s;ailants: Of this part of the wall we have given a &s;pecimen in the cut. From the round ba&s;|tion, at about forty paces, is a &s;quare ba&s;tion about ten feet in front, and pro|jecting
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE> about &s;even feet from the line of the wall: From thence at about forty|&s;ix paces, is a round ba&s;tion, &s;omewhat larger than that before de&s;cribed, making a projection of about ten feet, not &s;o prominent as the other: In all the part de&s;cribed the wall forms a &s;traight line, and the ground gradually inclines and falls from the edge of the cliffs where the wall begins. At the di&s;tance of about thirty paces the wall forms an obtu&s;e angle, guarded with a turret or ba&s;tion; from whence is a kind of horn-work projecting into the field for a con&s;iderable di&s;tance, of an angular figure, having two terraces one above another, with the remains of the glacis: The ma&s;on work appears through the broken turf. From thence is a very exten&s;ive pro&s;pect of the &s;ea and coa&s;t towards Sunderland, com|manding Hawthorn Hive, or the beacon point, Ea&s;ington, Elwick beacon, and a long tract of country. At about thirteen paces from the angle, there is the ap|pearance of a &s;allyport, but the wall has been repaired and altered in modern times, &s;o that it is not po&s;&s;ible to a&s;certain more concerning it. At the di&s;tance of about &s;ixty paces is a round ba&s;tion; at about &s;ixty paces further the great land gate, being the chief entrance to the town from Durham, opening upon a road
<PB N="27" REF="79">forced over a level mar&s;h, ea&s;ily broken up or flooded in a &s;iege. This gate
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE> &s;eems to have been &s;trengthened with a wet ditch, and probably a draw bridge. The whole wall, towers, and gateways are of excellent ma&s;onry, built of lime|&s;tone which is won in the &s;ea banks, of &s;o &s;oft a nature in the bed or quarry, that it may be &s;quared with an adge, but when expo&s;ed to the air, becomes remark|ably hard and durable; the arch of this gateway is rib'd, and be&s;ides double gates, had its portcullis; the width of the pa&s;&s;age is ten feet, and of the whole gateway tower about thirty feet: The projection is not much above a foot from the face of the wall: It appears to have had a &s;trong tower for its &s;uper&s;tructure, entered at each &s;ide from the parapet of the wall. The approach to the town from this gate was by the &s;ide of the haven, which mu&s;t have made a fine appearance; as the ba&s;on, if we may judge from the pre&s;ent &s;lake or mora&s;s, con&s;i&s;ted of &s;everal acres, where a hundred &s;ail might lie moored. From this gateway the wall which &s;ecured the haven begins, and runs in a direct line, the water at high tide coming up to the gate. It is &s;omewhat more than eight feet thick, faced on each &s;ide with dre&s;&s;ed &s;tones, with a parapet guarded by a brea&s;t wall and embra&s;ure, now greatly decayed. There is a water gate in this wall, formed by a low, pointed arch, about twenty-four feet in &s;pan, and ten feet high, for &s;mall cra&s;t to pa&s;s in and out of the haven without removing the boom chains, afterwards noted: This gateway projects from the face of the wall about eighteen inches, has had flood gates, and al&s;o a watch tower, as we apprehend, from the remains of the &s;uper&s;tructure. From thence at the di&s;tance of about &s;eventeen paces, is a &s;quare ba&s;tion, about eight feet in front; and nearly one hundred paces di&s;tant is another &s;quare ba&s;tion; and from thence about &s;eventy paces, is a lofty round tower, remaining very per|fect, &s;ave the parapet and embra&s;ures: Oppo&s;ite to it, at the di&s;tance of thirty-&s;ix feet, &s;tood another tower, exactly &s;imilar in dimen&s;ions, as the facia and founda|tions plainly &s;hew. This was the grand entrance into the haven, and by the &s;pace
<PB N="28" REF="80">between the towers, one may judge of the &s;ize of tho&s;e ve&s;&s;els which were moored therein<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A thirty gun &s;hip is thirty-two feet wide.</NOTE>. This entrance was guarded by large boom chains &s;tretched from tower to tower, the remains of the loops belonging to &s;uch chains being &s;till vi&s;ible in the walls of the tower. At ten paces di&s;tance are the foundations of a round ba&s;tion, near which is a modern-gate, where it is pre&s;umed formerly was a &s;mall door way for the convenience of per&s;ons landing from boats: At twenty-four paces di&s;tance the wall forms an angle, and turns towards the &s;ea: This angle is defended by a half moon. The entrance into the haven had the peculiar &s;ecurity, that ve&s;&s;els coming from the &s;ea mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily double the cape or point of the i&s;thmus, and then proceed along the whole range and &s;tretch of the &s;outh wall, within reach of the engines and in&s;truments of war, and pa&s;s the half moon which guarded the angle of the wall. At the di&s;tance of &s;ixty paces from the angle, is a &s;quare ba&s;tion, and near it a large breach in the wall; from the &s;quare ba&s;tion, about one hundred and twenty paces, is a large &s;quare projection in the wall, mo&s;t probably modern, about twenty yards long, with a &s;allyport; and from thence one hundred and twenty paces, is a round ba&s;tion; and next &s;tands the gateway, now called the water gate, and which only communicates with the land at low water, and leads to the high &s;treet: The arch of this gateway is pointed, about eight feet in width, and defended on each hand by angular turrets, with the points projecting; a figure not very commonly met with in old fortifications: From this gate the wall advances to and buts upon the rock near its point, where the pier or mole begins: The whole of this &s;outh part appears much more modern than the north and we&s;t &s;ides.</P>

Whereas the burge&s;&s;es and inhabitants of our burrough or town of Hartlepool, in the bi&s;hopric of Durham, have peaceably and quietly, beyond the memory of man, had, held, and enjoyed very many lea&s;es, juri&s;dictions, liberties, franchi&s;es, and divers other cu&s;toms, immunities, and exemptions, as well by pre&s;cription, as al&s;o by virtue of divers charters, grants, and confirmations, made of old by our predece&s;&s;ors, kings of England, unto the &s;aid burge&s;&s;es and inhabitants of the &s;aid burrough, and to their &s;ucce&s;&s;ors. And whereas our &s;aid burge&s;&s;es of our &s;aid burrough of Hartlepoole, have now mo&s;t humbly petitioned us, graciou&s;ly and liberally to exhibit and extend to them our royal bounty and grace, and that we would vouch&s;afe for the better rule, government, and improvement of the &s;aid burrough, to make and create the &s;aid burge&s;&s;es and inhabitants a corporation and body politic.

And al&s;o at the humble &s;uit, reque&s;t, and petition of our well beloved Sir John Lumley, lord Lumley, and of our &s;pecial grace and favour, and from our certain knowledge, and mere motion, have willed, ordered, ordained, con&s;tituted, granted, and declared, and do by the&s;e pre&s;ents, for us, our heirs, and &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, will, ordain, con&s;titute, grant, and declare, that our afore&s;aid burrough of Hartlepoole be, and continue for ever after, a free burrough of it&s;elf.

Witne&s;s our&s;elf at We&s;t|min&s;ter, the third day of February, in the five and thirtieth year of our reign.</P></NOTE>, the cau&s;e doth not &s;eem to be derived from the natural di&s;advantages of the &s;itua|tion, but from the great &s;taples of the country ri&s;ing in di&s;tant parts, and lying
<PB N="29" REF="81">upon the rivers Tyne, Were, and Tee&s;e, coals and lead being &s;hipped there. The haven now receives &s;mall ve&s;&s;els only, and it is di&s;tant from large towns: But
<PB N="30" REF="82">the&s;e circum&s;tances may in part be obviated, &s;o as to re&s;tore a con&s;iderable trade to Hartlepool: It lies &s;o happily for &s;hips to avoid a &s;torm, that was the haven im|proved
<PB N="31" REF="83">proved it would &s;oon be re&s;orted to: Ve&s;&s;els loading at Stockton have to make a dangerous navigation, forty miles up a river full of &s;hifting &s;ands and various pro|montories,
<PB N="32" REF="84">which greatly retard the pa&s;&s;age: Hartlepool lies in a great corn country, and is mo&s;t commodiou&s;ly &s;ituated for &s;hipping corn and lime. In order to improve the haven and town, it is po&s;&s;ible at a &s;mall expence to carry a mole cro&s;s the &s;lake, from the &s;outh-we&s;t angle of the town wall to the main land, which would &s;top the tide from flooding many valuable acres of ground, and occa&s;ion a &s;weep of water to clean&s;e an exten&s;ive ba&s;on, where &s;hips would lie in great &s;afety under the &s;helter of the land, and ply clo&s;e to the walls, which at a &s;mall co&s;t might be converted to a quay for merchandi&s;e. Another great advantage the town would derive from &s;uch a mole is, that the land communication would be effectually &s;ecured, whereas now, at high water, carriages mu&s;t come &s;even miles round. The mayor of this corporation is generally a man of con&s;equence in the county, and it is not to be doubted, but &s;ome &s;uch project might be carried into execution, at once to enrich the place, and benefit the adjacent country.</P>
<P>But quitting this digre&s;&s;ion, we ob&s;erve, that bi&s;hop Neville granted his com|mi&s;&s;ion, dated the 24th of March, in the &s;eventeenth year of his pontificate, for the mayor and burge&s;&s;es to build a pier or mole, <Q><HI>ad faciend. con&s;truend. et erigend. &startq;quandam peram juxta muros eju&s;dem villae ex au&s;trali p'te villae p' &s;alva cu&s;todia o'um &endq;navium &amp; batellor. infra portum i'b'm applicantium,</HI></Q> &amp;c. with a power to collect and receive the contributions of charitable per&s;ons; and bi&s;hop Booth renewed the licence and enlarged the power. The pier or mole runs out from the point of the rocks towards the &s;outh-we&s;t, to form the ba&s;on or bay, where the &s;hips lie: It has been repaired at &s;undry times by generous donations; but &s;eems in effect to occa&s;ion the ba&s;on to wreck up with &s;and more than it naturally would, in con|&s;equence of the channel the tide makes up the &s;lake.

<P>The town of Hartlepool &s;tretches up the we&s;tern &s;ide of the hill, having now only one regular &s;treet; at the head of which, towards the north, on elevated ground, &s;tands the church. Of late years here has been a great re&s;ort, in the bathing &s;ea&s;on, and the town is generally crowded with families of con&s;equence: The earl of Darlington has a commodious hou&s;e here, be&s;ides which there are &s;everal hand&s;ome buildings: The corporation hall, or man&s;ion-hou&s;e, is modern. On the pa&s;ture ground, within the walls, are multitudes of lines and brea&s;t works ca&s;t up, which from the variety of angles formed therein, appear to be modern, and were perhaps made on the approach of an enemy, when a de&s;cent was threaten|ed &s;ome time in the la&s;t century, or by the Scotch, who, in the treaty made with king Charles I. on the 26th of December, 1647, were authori&s;ed to po&s;&s;e&s;s them|&s;elves of Tynemouth and the town of Hartlepool, (among other northern places) to be their retreat and magazines; and when peace was &s;ettled, their forces to be removed, and the ca&s;tles and towns to be delivered up<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Clarendon, Rapin, Smollett, &amp;c. &amp;c.</NOTE>. The coa&s;t to the north of the town, for &s;ome &s;hort &s;pace, is very rocky, and the &s;hore has long extended &s;hoals &s;tretching out in &s;pits of &s;and; but at &s;ome further di&s;tance is le&s;s dangerous, though expo&s;ed to a heavy &s;ea from the north-ea&s;t. The rocks are excavated by the violence of the waves, and are formed into caverns, grote&s;que arches, piazzas, and other excavations, &s;o as to afford plea&s;ant and romantic retreats at low water.</P>
<P>At &s;ome little di&s;tance from the church, and nearer to the &s;ea, are the ruins of the friarage. This religious hou&s;e is noted by Tanner: <Q>Here was a hou&s;e of &startq;Grey Friars, founded before 1275, and after the di&s;&s;olution, viz. thirty-&s;eventh &endq;of Henry VIII. it was granted to John D'oyley and John Scudamore.</Q> Vide Pat. 30 Edw. 3. p. 1. m. 9. There is no valuation on record at the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of this hou&s;e, the Franci&s;cans generally living upon alms, having neither lands or rents. In the year 1275, Walter of Merton, by will left ten marks to the friars here. This was a foundation of Robert de Brus, who came to the&s;e po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions by the heire&s;s of Fulk. <Q>The frierage of Hartlepool was founded by the &s;ame &startq;Robert de Bru&s;e, (&s;c. founder of Gi&s;burn) being grey friers of the order of Sainte Fraunces, as I am thereof informed; and for the value of the &s;ame hou&s;e &endq;yow &s;hall know at my cuming upp<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Bibl.

<P>On the &s;outh &s;ide of the town, and within a few yards of the water gate, there is a chalybeate &s;pring, which is covered by the &s;ea every tide: It ri&s;es very &s;low, di&s;covers a little &s;ulphur, which &s;oon flies off after taking up; it leaves a white

<P>Having now made our progre&s;s along the coa&s;ts of this county, it &s;eems nece&s;|&s;ary to ob&s;erve, that this tract chiefly con&s;i&s;ts of corn lands: The cattle bred here are &s;mall and not of the be&s;t form: The &s;heep are of an inferior kind both in carca&s;e and wool, their improvement having been neglected, and the nece&s;&s;ary cro&s;&s;es of the breed unattended to. Excellent hor&s;es have been bred in this part of the county, but not many of them. There is one &s;ubject to be ob&s;erved upon, that is even a national concern of much importance, and not le&s;s a provincial one; the growth of timber is almo&s;t wholly neglected in this exten&s;ive and valuable tract: Much of the country being under &s;uch a tenure, that the land-holder thinks it inexpedient to grow wood, becau&s;e he cannot cut it without licence, and pay|ing heavy dues to the church; thence the want of ornament and &s;helter is derived, and a mo&s;t valuable production of the e&s;tates is prevented. There are few men who&s;e minds can bear to &s;ee the produce of their lands &s;wept away by rapacious hands, or otherwi&s;e wa&s;tefully &s;uffered to &s;ink into decay, from a prohibition which debars them from reaping it: It would be happy if the legi&s;lature &s;hould interfere in this matter; or without that interference, if the enlarged virtues and prevailing benevolence of the age, could gain acce&s;s to the convocations, chapters, and clo&s;ets of the clergy, to the end they might be moved to correct the &s;ervility of tenure which occa&s;ions &s;o deplorable a deprivation to the public at large, as well as the private proprietor of lands, that they may be induced to grant a general power to their le&s;&s;ees, to grow and cut timber, and even add thereto by premiums to encourage planting: The advantage to be reaped needs no argument: In order to this purpo&s;e, a baneful influence mu&s;t be corrected; for whil&s;t the unfeeling officer eyes with avidity the fees of licence, his unnatural hand will blight the planter's labour, and, trembling with the gra&s;p of avarice, wither up improvement. Should it be alleged, the project for the maritime &s;ituation of the lands is merely vi&s;ionary and impracticable, let the country along the &s;hores be viewed; &s;ee what timber trees lie buried in the &s;ands, the memorials of fallen fore&s;ts: Seaton pa&s;ture, now known only by name, long &s;ince incroached upon and covered by the ocean, grew timber of a large &s;ize: The whole &s;hore at low water exhibits the &s;tems of trees wa&s;hed up by the roots, pre&s;erved to this day by the mo&s;s earth in which they lie: Let attention be paid to the places where trees now grow, that the cau&s;e may be a&s;certained of their being blighted or not pro&s;pering, and to the common ob&s;ervers it will be obvious, that there only wants a &s;trong plantation for their nur&s;ery. A hedge row, or a &s;mall plantation of trees, will not thrive, unable to endure the cold vapour and heavy &s;torms of wind from the &s;ea; it is well known the &s;alt is no cau&s;e of injury, as it does not exhale. The fine planta|tions round Hardwick, and the wood and underwood growing in the deans and various other &s;ituations between Shields and Hartlepool, prove the ob&s;ervation: Some trees endure the cold air better than others; the chief of tho&s;e are the &s;yca|more and narrow-leafed elm; but under their &s;helter oaks, pines, and poplars will
<PB N="35" REF="88">thrive admirably. The number of acres to be planted might be &s;tipulated in each lea&s;e, and the glebe lands of the parochial clergy might al&s;o have a &s;hare in the improvement, by &s;ome wi&s;e regulation.</P>
<P>To return to the &s;ubject: HART is a &s;mall irregular village; the church &s;tands in an elevated &s;ituation; the chancel is twelve paces long and five wide, with a large window to the ea&s;t, and two &s;mall windows north and &s;outh; it is divided from the nave by a large circular arch. The nave has two &s;ide ailes; is in length to the tower fourteen paces, and in width, including the ailes, fifteen paces; the north aile is formed by one &s;hort column, &s;upporting circular arches, and is light|ed by two &s;ide windows, and one to the ea&s;t; the &s;outh aile has three &s;mall octa|gonal pillars, the arches a little pointed, two &s;ide windows, and one to the ea&s;t, under pointed arches: The tower is low. In the &s;outh wall of the chancel is a figure in armour, cut in relief, &s;laying a dragon, a cro&s;s upon the &s;hield. The font is much &s;culptured, bearing the emblematical figures of the evangeli&s;ts, with the figures of Peter and Paul in relief. Robert de Brus, who founded Gi&s;burn, gave the churches of Hart and Stranton, with their chapels, to that priory, and bi&s;hop Kellaw, by his charter bearing date the twelfth of the kal. of November, 1311, confirmed to the church of St Mary, of Gy&s;eburn, and the canons there &s;erving God, the donations and confirmations which his predece&s;&s;ors, bi&s;hops of Durham, had granted them, with the concurrence of their chapters, viz. the church of Hart and its chapel, the church of Stranton and its chapel of Seton, with all their lands which Robert de Brus gave them, and which Hugh Pud&s;ey, bi&s;hop of Durham, with the con&s;ent of his chapter, confirmed to their proper u&s;e; and all the lands and rents which William and Robert de Brus gave them in the towns of Hert and Hertillpolle, viz. of the &s;treet called St Mary's-&s;treet, and of other rents in the &s;ame town<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mon.

<P>The church at Hartlepool, as ob&s;erved before, &s;tands on elevated ground; the architecture of the mo&s;t ancient parts, the tower and center aile, &s;hews, that this was once a beautiful building; the chancel has been taken down, leaving merely a rece&s;s for the altar, and the &s;ide ailes have been rebuilt, near the &s;ame period of time. The length of the nave is about twenty-&s;even paces, and with the ailes fourteen paces wide. The ailes are formed by five pillars on each &s;ide, light and clu&s;tered, &s;upporting pointed arches, beautiful and well proportioned; the chan|cel has been divided from the nave by a lofty pointed arch &s;pringing from a clu&s;ter of pila&s;ters. The church is regularly &s;talled with oak, paved, and kept with great neatne&s;s: There is a gallery on the we&s;t end. This church or chapel is dedicated to St Hilda. There are &s;everal ancient monuments in the church-yard, but without in&s;criptions, and the effigies &s;o mutilated as to render it impo&s;&s;ible to a&s;certain to what per&s;onages they belonged: They are &s;culptured in long ve&s;tments, and probably belonged to eccle&s;ia&s;tics, and not the families of Brus or Clifford, as has been imagined, it being &s;aid they were removed from the chancel: On one is a &s;crip or &s;croll falling from the hand, but the in&s;cription defaced. There is a large table monument of blue marble under the ea&s;t win|dow, with the arms of Brus, but without in&s;cription, which was in the middle of the old chancel.</P>
<P>There was a chapel in the warren, without the walls, dedicated to St Helen, which William de Brus, who died in the reign of king John, gave for the &s;upport of a light at the great altar of Gi&s;burne. Ralph de Whitewell, a ba&s;tard, ordered by will, Hugh del Fermory and Roger de Ebor, his executors, to &s;ell a me&s;&s;uage, with its appurtenances in Hartlepool, to rai&s;e a &s;tipend for the maintenance of a chaplain to pray for him in the chapel of St Helen, &s;o long as the purcha&s;e money would la&s;t. At his death, bi&s;hop Beaumont &s;eized this me&s;&s;uage, and kept it as an e&s;cheat: But bi&s;hop Bury, on the 3d of April, 1336, allowed the will to &s;tand good, having found by an inqui&s;ition taken before Simon de Grime&s;by his &s;teward, that Ralph had demi&s;ed it as his chattel above ten months before he died<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sheriff's Rolls, Auditors Office, Durh.

<P>By the records it appears, that the manor and vill of Seaton were the e&s;tate of the family of Carrowe, &s;o early as the time of Richard I. Peter Carrowe, in the king's charter made to Hugh bi&s;hop of Durham, of the manor of Sadberg, is therein &s;aid to hold his lord&s;hip of Seaton of the crown by the &s;ervice of one knight's fee, which &s;ervice he and his heirs are awarded from thenceforth to ren|der to the See of Durham, as others the bi&s;hops tenants between Tyne and Tee&s;e. Roald the prior, with the convent of Gi&s;burn, in the pre&s;ence of Philip bi&s;hop of Durham, A^o 1200, licen&s;ed Walter the &s;on of Peter Carrowe, to have a perpetual chantry within the chapel of Seaton, therein to &s;olemnize all church rights; in con&s;ideration of which he gave to the convent &s;ixty acres and tofts of land, which Anne his grandmother &s;ome time held, with pa&s;turage for one hundred &s;heep and their lambs. In 1337, John de Carrowe died &s;ei&s;ed of this manor, which he held <HI>in capite</HI> of the bi&s;hop, by homage and fealty, and the &s;ervice of a fourth part of a knight's fee, and doing &s;uit at the wapontake of Sadberg, with a yearly rent of 13 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> 4 <ABBR>d.</ABBR> payable at the bi&s;hop's exchequer in Durham, at the fea&s;t of St John Bapti&s;t, value xx <ABBR>l.</ABBR><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Inq. p. m.

The chancel is about &s;even paces long and &s;ive wide; is ceiled above with wood, and lighted to the ea&s;t by a window of three divi&s;ions under a pointed arch: It is divided from the nave by a low circular arch. The nave hath &s;ide ailes; is in length about thirteen paces, and in width, with the ailes, twelve paces. The ailes are formed by rows of three round columns, bearing pointed arches, with this variety, that the capitals of the north row of columns are octagonal, and tho&s;e of the &s;outh row round.

The Pari&s;h of <HI>SEDGEFIELD.</HI></HEAD>
<P>Towards the we&s;t lies the pari&s;h of SEDGEFIELD. The town of SEDGEFIELD is one of the fine&s;t &s;ituations in the county, &s;tanding proudly upon a &s;well of gra|velly ground, open to every a&s;pect, and remarkable for the health and longevity of its inhabitants. The celebrated Dr A&s;kew called this place the Montpelier of the north, and frequently recommended his convale&s;cent patients to it for the be|nefit of the air. All the country round is in a high &s;tate of cultivation; the lands are fertile, well and beautifully inclo&s;ed, and many of them near the town bearing a rent of above forty &s;hillings an acre. The center of the town forms a large &s;quare, in which is erected a hand&s;ome cro&s;s, and where a market is held every Friday. To the &s;outh and &s;outh-ea&s;t you command a delightful view of Cleve|land, Ro&s;eberry-topping, and a long range of lofty hills, with the borders of the river Tees down to the German Ocean: To the &s;outh-we&s;t, a beautiful country, where Heighington crowns the di&s;tant eminence; the tower of that church is a

On the nearer land|&s;cape are the elegant works of Mr Burdon at Hardwick; and Sands, the hou&s;e of Ralph Ord, <ABBR>e&s;q</ABBR> with the grounds neatly cultivated, and many thriving planta|tions. To the &s;outh-we&s;t, the plantations and eminences above Raby, Cockfield|fell, and the heights of Evenwood, are &s;een; and further northward, but nearer hand, Windle&s;tone-hou&s;e, the lofty tower of We&s;terton and Merrington church, and the town of Ferryhill: To the north, the beautiful villa of Mainsforth, the towns of Bi&s;hop-Middleham and Fi&s;hburn, and on the di&s;tant hills the town of Trimdon; and to the north-ea&s;t, Elwick-beacon.</P>

The arches are pointed, and ornamented with mouldings, the outward one zigzag; they &s;pring from pila&s;ters on the &s;ide walls, and ri&s;e from grote&s;que heads on the capitals of the pillars.

<P>The learned have been much at a lo&s;s to know the meaning of &s;o &s;trange a repre&s;entation. Perhaps this was the tomb of one of the knights of Jeru&s;alem, as Foxton, in this pari&s;h, belonged to that order: In their initiation were u&s;ed many emblematical in&s;ignia and religious types, one of which was expre&s;&s;ive of a certain faith of future life and a re&s;urrection from the dead; part of the oath was, that he &s;hould not fear to die for the cau&s;e of religion: In other religious orders, and e&s;pecially that much ridiculed &s;ociety&mdash;the free-ma&s;ons, the candidate is conceived to be under the dominion of death and the corruptions of nature, from whence he is &s;aved by the powers of revelation and chri&s;tian faith; nothing can be more awful than the ceremony: The &s;imilarity is &s;o very &s;triking, that we are bold to deliver this conjecture; but that the reader may determine for him&s;elf on the &s;ubject, we have tran&s;cribed at large what is &s;aid on a &s;imilar monument in that great work lately publi&s;hed by Mr Gough, intitled, 'Sepulchral Monuments in Great-Britain,' p. ex.</P>
<P>"I &s;hall only mention one monument, which is &s;omewhat peculiar; I mean the repre&s;entation of a &s;ke|leton in a &s;hroud, lying either under or on a table tomb.

<P>To the we&s;t of Sedgefield, about half a mile, lies HARDWICK, the &s;eat of John Burdon, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> one of the mo&s;t beautiful places in the county; where, as Pope &s;ays, <HI>'Gods might wander with delight.'</HI> The plea&s;ure-grounds are laid out with exqui&s;ite ta&s;te, and the ornaments are &s;upremely elegant. The walks and plantations are formed on an ea&s;y inclination, facing to the we&s;t; and a fine ba&s;on of water covers the hollow between the ri&s;ing grounds. Mr Burdon &s;hows a di&s;tingui&s;hed liberality to the public by the free admi&s;&s;ion of all vi&s;iters. On entering the gardener's gate, you pa&s;s the wood by a &s;erpentine walk which leads to the grand terrace, a gravel walk about 24 feet in width, and upwards of 560 paces in length: At this point of view (looking over a circular ba&s;on of water) the bath-hou&s;e terminates the pro&s;pect at one end, and the tower of Sedgefield church at the other: Advancing a little further, you pa&s;s the wood, and come in|&s;tantly to a view of the fine&s;t &s;heet of water in the north of England, con&s;i&s;ting of 36 acres, margined with gra&s;s &s;lopes, plantations of flowering &s;hrubs and ever|greens, thickened with fore&s;t trees behind; all kep$ in the greate&s;t order and ex|actne&s;s. A &s;erpentine canal runs through the grounds into the lake, under a rock bridge. From this &s;tation you have the dome of the temple to the right; and to the left, the mock ruins of a mona&s;tic hou&s;e, well devi&s;ed, built of a bright free-&s;tone, and &s;ituated at the extremity of the lake: An elegant Gothic &s;eat, &s;haded by thick groves, and open to this &s;cene, invites the vi&s;iter to its cool rece&s;s. Below the bath there are &s;ome artificial ca&s;cades, an hermitage, confined and winding walks, and works, in the &s;tile of the la&s;t age, placed here to give the contra&s;t between the poli&s;hed ta&s;te of the pre&s;ent times and the rural orna|ments which delighted our ance&s;tors. From thence you pa&s;s to the temple, a building in the Ionic order, erected on a round eminence at a little di&s;tance from the &s;kirts of the plantations; the colonade is &s;quare, and the dome octagonal; in the out&s;ide niches are placed bu&s;ts of Homer, Virgil, Cicero, Sappho, Theocritus, Pindar, &amp;c; the floor is 18 feet &s;quare within, inlaid with marble in Mo&s;aic work; there are al&s;o eight bu&s;ts of the philo&s;ophers, and above the door, a Pal|las: The &s;tucco work was done by Carti&s;i; and the dome painted by the Bor|ne&s;e, father and &s;on: The cardinal virtues and the arts painted in the &s;quares;
<PB N="66" REF="120">and Pallas, &s;urrounded by Genii, in the center: Medallions of the four &s;ea&s;ons, in &s;tucco work, are in the rece&s;&s;es between the windows. As you walk the colo|nade, you have a view of Heighington, Shackerton, and Bru&s;leton towers, Win|dle&s;ton-hou&s;e, Merrington town and church, Ferryhill, Mensforth, Bi&s;hop-Mid|dleham, and the heights of Garmond&s;way; much of the plea&s;ure-grounds, the Gothic &s;eat, banqueting-hou&s;e, ruin, and Sedgefield church. Returning by the bath-hou&s;e, after pa&s;&s;ing the Gothic &s;eat, you proceed by the margin of the &s;er|pentine river, opened by a &s;pacious and inclining lawn on one &s;ide, and clo&s;ed on the oppo&s;ite by a &s;hrubbery and plantations, which run clo&s;e upon its brink. You now advance to the banqueting-hou&s;e, built in a mo&s;t &s;uperb &s;tile, in the Corinthian order; the entrance is at the back part; the chief apartment is 50 feet in length, 25 feet and a half in width, and of an equal height; the ends have bow windows, but the front windows are plain; the ceiling is elegantly painted; in an oval in the center, the a&s;&s;embly and banquet of the gods, by Hay|man; to the right, in a &s;quare, Thetis's petition to Jupiter; and to the left, the ce&s;tus pre&s;ented to Juno, both by Wale; above the &s;ide doors, two pieces by Hayman, the one of Cupid and P&s;yche, the other a proce&s;&s;ion of Bacchanals; over the fire-place is a full-length of Mr Burdon, a &s;triking likene&s;s; eight brackets are furni&s;hed with bu&s;ts of Palladio, Vitruvius, Inigo Jones, and others; the &s;tucco work is fine, and the mouldings richly gilt; the mantle-piece and grate are equal in ornament and beauty to the re&s;t of the fini&s;hing: There is a &s;mall room at the &s;ide, in which is a painting of Venus on the ceiling, and Diana and Endymion over the fire-place: The de&s;igns of the &s;everal buildings were made by Payne, and executed by the late Mr Bell, of Durham. As you approach the ruin, you come to a very fine point of view, where the &s;erpentine river makes a &s;wift turn, takes a deep channel, covered thick with wood on each &s;ide, and forming a long canal, is cro&s;&s;ed at the extremity by a beautiful bridge, which intercepts the further view of its cour&s;e; and indeed it is &s;o contrived, that there the water &s;hould die away from the fight. The tower of the ruin commands an exten&s;ive pro&s;pect, not only having the &s;cene de&s;cribed at the colonade, to the we&s;t and north, but al&s;o a prodigious tract of country ea&s;tward: This building is orna|mented with &s;culptures brought from the ruins of Gui&s;burn priory; among them is a delicate piece of many figures, which, it is to be lamented, is expo&s;ed to the weather. In the&s;e plea&s;ure-grounds there are 44 acres covered with water; and the whole works contain 150 acres. Mr Burdon has not yet thought proper to build a man&s;ion-hou&s;e. We cannot quit the&s;e delightful &s;cenes without referring the reader to what Mr Walpole &s;ays in his fourth volume of 'Anecdotes;' the works here bearing every expre&s;&s;ion of that ta&s;te and art, which he &s;peaks of with &s;o much &s;pirit and delight.</P>

<P>Mr Cade, in his Letter to the Reverend Dr Kaye, publi&s;hed in the &s;eventh volume of the Archaeologia, page 74, accompanied with a plate, &s;tyled <HI>The Camp at Mainsforth,</HI> &s;ays, <Q>There are &s;everal camps or &s;tations in this county, which &startq;undoubtedly were of Roman original; but being &s;ub&s;equently occupied by different tribes of adventurers, and altered according to their re&s;pective modes of defence, this circum&s;tance has cau&s;ed their primary occupancy to be over|looked by antiquaries. I &s;hall mention particularly tho&s;e of <HI>Mainsforth</HI> and <HI>Maiden Ca&s;tle</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See &s;econd volume, p. 308.</NOTE>; the former containing about &s;ixteen acres, viz. that part now di&s;tingui&s;hed by being called the camp, though the fortifications have been of much greater extent, as appears by the ve&s;tiges repeatedly di&s;covered, &amp;c. I can gain but little information re&s;pecting the camp at <HI>Mainsforth,</HI> which pro|bably may derive its name from <HI>Mainfort,</HI> as being of more importance than any other in the county; I vi&s;ited it about a month &s;ince; the country people called it Mount Narbon, or Narbal; it is &s;ituated about eight miles &s;outh of Old Durham, near a rivulet called the Little Skern, which has been converted into a deep fo&s;&s;e, and thereby rendered a place of great &s;trength. Its pre&s;ent form is circular, of an extraordinary elevation, and I apprehend had been occupied, if not fabricated into its pre&s;ent magnitude, by <HI>Gormondus</HI> the Dane; for about three miles northwards from hence we meet with the hamlet of Garmund&s;way, probably named after him; and near thereto, great quantities of human bones have been di&s;covered, both in making the roads, and in the adjacent fields. It &endq;is now the property of Robert Surtees, <ABBR>e&s;q</ABBR><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Mr Cade adds the following note.</HI>
<P><Q>&startq;I mu&s;t beg leave to ob&s;erve, that it appears to me very probable, that king Athel&s;tan &s;ixed his camp near Bradbury in this county, when he went again&s;t and gained that, deci&s;ive victory over the Danes in the year 937, viz. from Nun Stainton, about half a mile northwards, where we meet with &s;ome tumuli by the &s;ides of the road, and about two miles di&s;tant from the camp at Mainsforth, from which it is &s;eparated by a very exten&s;ive mora&s;s. This &s;ituation agrees very well with the accounts that Holling&s;head, Speed, and others, give us of this battle; and if we &s;ub&s;titute what is now called Bradbury for Brime&s;|bury, I believe we &s;hall not be guilty of any capital error. The rea&s;ons that induced me to embrace this opinion are, fir&s;t, we have an account of a combined army of Scots and Danes be&s;ieging the city of Du|re&s;me about ten years prior to this, the inhabitants being ready to revolt, only dreading the pui&s;&s;ance of king Athel&s;tan. Secondly, there is a large cavity on the &s;ummit of the camp at Mainsforth, which is at this day called the Danes-Hole, where there was lately dug up a pair of moo&s;e-deer horns, of an extra|ordinary &s;ize, probably brought from Ireland by Anlaf, as they &s;eem peculiar to that kingdom. And la&s;tly, that this county appears to have been the great &s;cene of action between the Saxons, Danes, and &endq;Normans in the tenth and eleventh centuries, from the frequent revolts that occurred, &amp;c.</Q></P></NOTE>.</Q> Speaking of the Roman ways, Mr Cade adds, <Q>The Rycknild-&s;treet originating at St David's, or Caermarthen &startq;in Wales, and &s;uppo&s;ed by our hypothe&s;is to be continued from Monk&s;bridge, Derby&s;hire, by Little Che&s;ter, Che&s;terfield, and the <HI>Strata Roma</HI> at Derby, to York, and from thence by Thornton-le-&s;treet to Sockburn, Sadberge, Stainton|le-&s;treet, Bradbury, Mainsforth, Old Durham, Che&s;ter, and Gate&s;head, to &endq;Shields and Tynemouth.</Q></P>
<P>The horn Mr Cade &s;peaks of in the note was found about the year 1740: the draw|ing from whence the cut was made was communicated by Mr Surtees, who &s;ays it was found by &s;ome labourers digging a pond, and not on the mount de&s;cribed by
<PB N="83" REF="137">
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE> Mr Cade. The horn mea&s;ures from the root B to the top A three feet eight inches; the circumference above the root D is ten inches. Large portions have been broken off the branches; particularly at one part, C, where the fracture is &s;ix inches long, and three inches wide. The remains of elephants have been di&s;covered in &s;everal parts of this i&s;land: we may &s;uppo&s;e the animal to which this horn belonged, or perhaps the horn only, was brought hither for &s;how or curio&s;ity. Our view, as well as enquiry, have equally been fruitle&s;s towards a di&s;covery of the Roman way Mr Cade attempts to draw from Sockburn, by Mainsforth, to Gate&s;head; and indeed the <HI>Stainton-le-&s;treet</HI> is not well a&s;certained, as is noted hereafter: neither have we been more fortunate in our attempts to e&s;tabli&s;h the camp which that gentleman is plea&s;ed to fix at Mainsforth; the ground has been particularly attended to, but no certain lines, or di&s;tinct characters, to &s;upport the idea of a camp here, have been made out. The name of <HI>Mount Narbon</HI> is difficult to define, and carries with it no evidence of Dani&s;h extraction. The etymology given to Mainsforth by Mr Cade, depends on the circum&s;tance of this mount having been a fort or camp. There is adjoining to Mainsforth, towards the north-we&s;t, a very large mora&s;s, over which a road is forced, leading to the great northern turnpike road: the north-country word <HI>Forth,</HI> the Saxon fo&wyn;d; the <HI>Mainford,</HI> meaning the <HI>chief pa&s;&s;age</HI> over the mora&s;s, may be applied to the pre&s;ent name of
<PB N="84" REF="138">the place. In the Boldon Buke, and al&s;o in &s;ome of the inqui&s;itions, it is called <HI>Maynesford,</HI> An. 16, Hatfield, <HI>apud Maynesford.</HI> The application of <HI>Brime&s;bury</HI> to Bradbury, in order to bring Athel&s;tan's camp into this place, cannot be depended on; and the old authors referred to, who mention the battle, call the place <HI>Brimesford, Brunabright, Browning field,</HI> and <HI>Brunenburg,</HI> which latter names have no &s;imilarity to that of <HI>Bradbury.</HI></P>
<P>Near to the mora&s;s, on the adjacent hill, is an old hou&s;e called the <HI>Swan-hou&s;e,</HI> where certain dues to the convent, and afterwards the chapter of Durham, called <HI>&s;wan oats</HI> have been anciently received.&mdash;Had the&s;e &s;wan oats been due to the bi&s;hop, the keeping of &s;wans being a royal privilege, we might have determined, that in the mora&s;s there had been a <HI>keep</HI> for &s;wans; but the prelates had no lands at Mainsforth of any great antiquity, the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of the See there having come by e&s;cheats and purcha&s;e, as noted in the Boldon Buke, and we do not hear of any grant to the convent of that privilege. The &s;wan oats paid to the church were part of the <HI>&s;eck rents</HI> for lands there, held under the convent, and now under the chapter; and in this in&s;tance we are again to lament the lo&s;s of the <HI>Mel&s;anby book,</HI> the doom&s;day of the convent, wherein this &s;pecies of rent would have been explained. There are the remains of a large dyke or mound, which formerly had confined the water in the mora&s;s, and cau&s;ed a large <HI>reach</HI> or <HI>canal</HI> there; perhaps water fowl were here kept for the u&s;e of the convent, and the &s;wan oats were applied for their maintenance.</P>
<P>The word <HI>Swain</HI> occurs in the ancient law books under &s;everal appellations, as <HI>Swain-mote,</HI> or Fore&s;t-court, &amp;c. the word s&wyn;ang, <HI>Country Swain,</HI> or <HI>Boklandman,</HI> holding by entry or court roll.</P>

<P>The beautiful &s;eal now u&s;ed by the ho&s;pital, and engraved at Mr Allan's expence, has occa&s;ioned much literary enquiry. The learned Mr Pegge, in his corre&s;pondence with Mr Allan upon the &s;ubject, &s;ays, <Q>I am of your opinion, that Stephen Payn &startq;was never ma&s;ter of Gretham ho&s;pital, but he was elected dean of Exeter, 1415, and continued in that po&s;t A^o. 1419. It appears from your &s;eal that he was the king's almoner, but the great difficulty is to know how either the king or his almoner came to be connected with this ho&s;pital; no token of this appears in your ac|count of the ho&s;pital, nor in the recital of the king's foundations in Thomas Goodwin's hi&s;tory of his reign, p. 340. I can only offer a crude conjecture on this head, (viz.) that the ho&s;pital had fallen into the king's hands by &s;ome means or other, between the year 1413, when the king begun his reign, and 1419, when Payn died. As to the &s;eal it&s;elf, the human figure no doubt repre&s;ents Dean Payn, as it is evident from the habit, and the ton&s;ure or coif. The arms at top are tho&s;e which are u&s;ually given to Edward the Confe&s;&s;or; tho&s;e on the left &s;ide are the arms of France and England, where you will ob&s;erve the fleurs-de-lis are &s;tinted to three, a mode of bearing which began in this reign; the coat on the right &s;ide I pre&s;ume to be Payn's paternal arms. It is clearly the &s;eal of the king's almoner, and of Stephen Payn as &s;uch; but then, what relation has a boat or &s;hip to that office? Here is another difficulty, and I profe&s;s I know not how to &s;olve it; <HI>bouche of court</HI> implies a maintenance and &s;ub&s;i&s;tence from thence, and <HI>bouge</HI> at the &s;ame time &s;ignifies a boat or &s;hip: Can this be the meaning of the device? All I can &s;ay is, that our ance&s;tors abounded with the like conceits, &s;o I &s;hall let it pa&s;s for a conceit, and a very fooli&s;h one. The &s;eal, however, tho' &s;o difficult to develope in &s;ome particulars, as &s;tated above, is neverthele&s;s very perfect, and &endq;even elegant.</Q></P>
<P>After repeating this noted antiquary's thoughts on the &s;ubject, it may appear arrogant to &s;ubjoin others; but the reader will perhaps pardon the following ob&s;ervations. In the year 1414, the commons, willing to comply with the king's demand of a &s;ub&s;idy, pre&s;ented an addre&s;s, praying he would po&s;&s;e&s;s him&s;elf of the riches of the church, and &s;eize the clergy's revenues. It was no novel thing; the preceding reign witne&s;&s;ed &s;uch another propo&s;al, and the argu|ment which &s;upported both was, that the great annual revenue of the church would be more beneficially employed to the public &s;ervice, the amount being three hundred and twenty-two thou&s;and marks, &s;ufficient to maintain fifteen earls, fifteen hundred knights, &s;ix thou&s;and two hundred e&s;quires, and a hundred ho&s;pitals; and the king's trea&s;ury reap yearly a &s;urplus of twenty thou&s;and pounds.
<PB N="104" REF="158">The alarm this &s;pread among the eccle&s;ia&s;ties occa&s;ioned them to a&s;&s;emble, and the archbi&s;hop of Canterbury propo&s;ed, that to &s;ave the general wreck of the church they &s;hould approach the king with the countenance of compliance; and as a te&s;timony of their zeal and attachment to his per&s;on and government, make a voluntary re&s;ignation of certain religious foundations where there was no cure of fouls, and therewith the alien priories. The king, willing rather to accept than extort, accepted the propo&s;al, and parliament confirmed the act. Whether Gretham fell into the king's hands on this occa&s;ion it is impo&s;&s;ible to determine; it is a probable conjecture that it did; and as the &s;eal fixes to a certainty that Payn was there, it is a con&s;equence that the ho&s;pital was in the hands of the king; as to the emblematical device of the &s;hip or boat, it might repre&s;ent the &s;tate here and on our old coins, and by the royal en&s;ign at the &s;tern the conjecture &s;eems plau&s;ible.</P>

<HEAD>PARKHURST'S HOSPITAL.</HEAD>
<P>In the year 1761, Dormer Parkhur&s;t, <ABBR>e&s;q</ABBR> then ma&s;ter, began to erect another ho&s;pital at Gretham for &s;ix poor women, widows or &s;pin&s;ters, for whom he built &s;ix neat &s;eparate dwelling-hou&s;es, with a garden-plot to each, and compleated the &s;ame in the &s;ucceeding year at his own expence; he al&s;o endowed it with lands to the annual value of thirty pounds, to be paid to &s;uch poor per&s;ons, and to &s;upply them with coals. The women now receive two cart loads of coals and a new gown every year, and two &s;hillings a week each. An ab&s;tract of the foundation deed is &s;et forth in the notes<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Copy Deed.

<P>The church of Billingham, it is &s;aid, was fir&s;t built by Eanred; but there is no appearance of that di&s;tant antiquity in any part of the pre&s;ent &s;tructure. The chancel is five paces wide, and thirteen long: The ea&s;t window con&s;i&s;ts of four lights, under a pointed arch; and there are four &s;mall windows to the fouth, and two to the north. The whole chancel is neatly wain&s;coted with oak; and en|clo&s;ed, from the nave, by a &s;creen, with &s;talls ornamented with pierced work, under a pointed arch. The nave has two &s;ide ailes, formed by rows of four co|lumns: Tho&s;e to the &s;outh are &s;quare, with a round pila&s;ter projecting from each angle; and &s;upport pointed arches, moulded with the zig-zag figure: The pillars to the north are heavy, and in no order of building, being of a lozenge figure, with blunted points. The arches are pointed, and without ornament: The lights are irregular: The length of the nave is twenty-two paces; and the width, in|cluding the &s;ide ailes, thirteen paces: There is a lofty tower. The patched work in this building induces us to believe, the &s;acred edifice had not only &s;uffer|ed many and great alterations at various periods; but al&s;o, that the whole of the old church had been taken down or de&s;troyed, not the lea&s;t memorial of &s;uch an|tiquity remaining<NOTE N="&para;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Billingham Vicarage,</HI> dedicated to St Cuthbert.

<HEAD>NORTON CHURCH</HEAD>
</FIGURE></P>
<P>Norton church, in its pre&s;ent &s;tate, appears to be much inferior to what it has been. The tower &s;tands in the center, &s;upported on four circular arches, form|ing a &s;quare of about twelve feet. The chancel is &s;ix paces in length, and five in width. The ea&s;t window con&s;i&s;ts of three lights; and there are two windows to the &s;outh, under flat or low elliptic arches. The length of the cro&s;s, from north to &s;outh, is &s;eventeen paces; the north limb of which is called Blaki&s;ton porch, being the burial-place of the owners of Blaki&s;ton; where there is a recumbent fi|gure in armour, cut in &s;tone, with a rich canopy of tabernacle work over the head; the hands elevated; the legs cro&s;&s;ed, re&s;ting on a lion; the right leg up|wards; the &s;word &s;heathed; a &s;hield with arms; by which we conceive it be|longed to Thomas Blaki&s;ton, who died in the year 1484. The nave hath &s;ide ailes, formed by two round columns, not ill proportioned, with light mouldings for capitals: They &s;upport pointed arches. The nave is twenty-one paces in length, from the opening of the chancel; and in width, with the &s;ide ailes, thir|teen paces. All the windows are flat-topped.&mdash;From this de&s;cription, the reader will ob&s;erve, that little of the old edifice remains, except the tower. The point|ed arches, and flat-topped windows, were introduced in times much po&s;terior to the heavy circular arch.&mdash;Mr John&s;on, the late vicar, pre&s;ented the above plate.</P>

<P>NORTON.&mdash;Coronatores wardae de Stockton &s;unt collectores reddit. ep'or de Norton.</P></NOTE>, it appears there were thirty villains in Norton, each
<PB N="113" REF="167">holding two oxgangs of land under the like rents and &s;ervices as tho&s;e of Boldon, except cornage rent, which they did not pay for want of pa&s;turage. This excep|tion
<PB N="114" REF="168">confirms a curious particular, as it di&s;tingui&s;hes, that the horn, &s;ounding an alarm on the approach of an enemy, was not of a military nature, to call the va&s;&s;als and tenants to arms, but to warn the hu&s;bandmen to drive their flocks and herds from the pa&s;tures into the &s;trong-holds, where they had ca&s;tle guard<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See v. i. p. 147.</NOTE> There were twenty farmers, who held forty oxgangs of land, rendering, for every two oxgangs, half a mark: They each plowed and harrowed half an acre in the lord's deme&s;ne, provided two men two days in mowing and reaping, and the like at hay-making; al&s;o, four carts one day, or one cart four days, for leading hay and corn; and dre&s;&s;ed four portions of land in autumn, with all their hou&s;ehold, ex|cept the hou&s;ewife. Alan de Normanton held one carucate of land; and pro|vided thirty-two men to work one day, and four carts one day, or two two days, to lead corn: And his men were to work, by dre&s;&s;ing four portions of land in autumn. Adam, the &s;on of Gilbert de Herdwick, held thirty-&s;ix acres of land in Herdwick, near Norton, then called &s;ixty acres; and rendered two marks at the bi&s;hop's plea&s;ure. The punder had four acres, and the thraves of Norton; and rendered four&s;core hens, and five hundred eggs. Twelve cottagers held tofts and crofts, and thirteen acres in the town-fields; rendering &s;ix &s;hillings, working fourteen days, and dre&s;&s;ing four portions of land in autumn. North-meadows were in the bi&s;hop's hands. The whole vill provided two milch cows. &mdash;By Hatfield's Survey, it appears, that Roger de Fulthorp then held Alan de Normanton's lands, as al&s;o the lands of John de Norton, called Trumperland, in dringage. In the rents and &s;ervices of the bond tenants, we &s;ee &s;catpennys, &s;cat or exchequer oats, and averpennys; and that they wrought three days in every week, except a week at Ea&s;ter and Penteco&s;t, and thirteen days at Chri&s;tmas: They were to fallow one day in the deme&s;nes of Stockton, and thereby were en|titled to a corrody. Every two villains were privileged to erect a booth at St Cuthbert's fair; and when required, the villains were, in every year, to build a hou&s;e, forty feet long, and fifteen wide. Every &s;ervant to a bond tenant, of the age of &s;ixteen years, paid yearly to the lord, towards the portions or dre&s;&s;ing of land in autumn, twelve-pence. Selfodes, or tho&s;e who &s;ub&s;i&s;ted independent of the lands, as &s;elf-holds, of whatever degree, dwellers in the vill, paid to the lord three-pence yearly. Tho&s;e who held exchequer lands, formerly the lands of bond tenants, among other &s;ervices, maintained the mill-dam and works, carried timber for the erection or repairs of the mill, found mill-&s;tones for Norton and Stockton mills, and maintained the water-mill at Norton: They ground their
<PB N="115" REF="169">corn at a thirteenth mulcture. Whenever the bi&s;hop repaired or rebuilt his ma|nor-hou&s;e at Stockton, they were to carry his timber for that purpo&s;e: They al&s;o carried a dole or pipe of wine from the river Tees to the bi&s;hop's cellars, in his manor-hou&s;e of Stockton.</P>

Blake&s;ton, &s;oon after this tran&s;action, was granted away by the prior and convent, to hold of them in fee, by certain &s;ervices and a re&s;erved rent.

<HEAD>The Pari&s;h of <HI>STOCKTON.</HI></HEAD>
<P>To the &s;outh of Norton lies the pari&s;h of STOCKTON.&mdash;The town of Stockton, &s;ituated on the banks of the river Tees, where it makes an ea&s;y curvature, forms a cre&s;cent. The principal &s;treet, lying almo&s;t due north and &s;outh, is &s;traight and level, near a mile in length, and one hundred and &s;ixty yards in breadth. Many of the hou&s;es are modern and elegant. From the main &s;treet, &s;everal others
<PB N="121" REF="175">&s;tretch down to the quay. The town-hou&s;e, or corporation-hall, &s;tands acro&s;s the center of the main &s;treet, and ob&s;tructs the view: Had it been a terminating ob|ject at either extremity, (as it is a hand&s;ome edifice) it would have greatly im|proved the beauty of the place: Before it, was lately erected a pillar of the Do|ric order, 33 feet high. There are al&s;o &s;hambles in this &s;treet, which might well have been &s;pared: Yet, even with the&s;e defects, Stockton is the hand&s;ome&s;t town in the north of England.</P>
<P>It is a place of antiquity; and although a member of the wapentake of Sad|berge, was part of the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of the bi&s;hops of Durham before the grant of that earldom, and claimed the attention of our prelates. There appertained to it a ca&s;tle, built, as &s;ome &s;uppo&s;e<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Randal, &amp;c. &amp;c. We have &s;een a drawing of the ca&s;tle, but believe it imaginary; perhaps the cor|poration &s;eal bears a re&s;emblance of it.</NOTE>, by one of the kings of England. Bi&s;hop Pud|&s;ey, who was a near relation of king Stephen, was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of Stockton, as we find by the Boldon Buke; and probably it was held by &s;ome of the Normans, with Norton, originally the chief place of the pari&s;h; and that tho&s;e manors were given &s;oon after the conque&s;t to the church of Durham. We find in the Boldon Buke the de&s;criptions of <HI>"Toftum Aulae"</HI> and <HI>"contra Aulam,"</HI> which imply that the chief place of the manor had only the name of <HI>Hall</HI> at that time. Tradi|tion &s;ays, king John was entertained here by bi&s;hop Philip, and then &s;igned the charter of Newca&s;tle. Bi&s;hop Farnham died here in 1257: Bi&s;hop Kellow rebuilt the palace on an improved plan, <HI>"Pulchram illam Cameram de Stockton aedificavit."</HI> Bi&s;hop Bury frequently re&s;ided here, as appears from various in&s;truments i&s;&s;ued from hence: Bi&s;hop Matthew lodged at Stockton in 1597, when part of the edifice was burnt; and here bi&s;hop Morton took re&s;uge when he fled for fear of the Scots. The ca&s;tle and deme&s;nes were &s;old in the great rebellion of 1647 for 6165 <ABBR>l.</ABBR>; &s;oon after that it was di&s;mantled, and the materials di&s;po&s;ed of: The &s;mall remains are now converted into a barn, lying at the &s;outh end of the town; and the ad|jacent grounds &s;till bear the names of the Park, the Ca&s;tle-yard, &amp;c. The manor belongs to the bi&s;hop, and the deme&s;ne lands bring him in about 600 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> a year.</P>
<P>Stockton is a town corporate by pre&s;cription; governed by a mayor, recorder, and &s;ix aldermen; it is al&s;o one of the four ward-towns of the county. This place is divided into two di&s;tinct con&s;tableries; one of which con&s;i&s;ts of the borough of Stockton, governed by the mayor and burge&s;&s;es, who hold their borough-court with a court-leet: Within the limits, the proper officers of the borough collect the rates and duties. The manor hath a copyhold-court, a greve or bailiff, a con|&s;table, and other officers, who collect di&s;tinct rates and duties within their di&s;trict<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">They join in rai&s;ing the poor-rate; and a workhou&s;e was lately built which co&s;t near 400 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> &s;ituated in the town. The order of &s;eparation was made about the year 1677.&mdash;According to the a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ment of 1740, the borough rental was 1200 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> which, at 12 <ABBR>d.</ABBR> per pound, rai&s;ed 60 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> That of the town in hou&s;es, 1200 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> in lands, 2200 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> The hou&s;es rated at 12 <ABBR>d.</ABBR> rai&s;ed 60 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> the lands at 18 <ABBR>d.</ABBR> 165 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> It was complained of that the borough had equal inhabitants and more poor, and if each con&s;tablery maintained its own poor, the town would be greatly relieved.
<P>Stockton tolls and port are lea&s;ed to the corporation by the bi&s;hop of Durham for the term of twenty-one years, under the de&s;cription of&mdash; <Q>All that his port, haven, and creek of Stockton, extending from the bar &startq;or low-water mark of the &s;ea unto the wath &s;tead called Wor&s;ell Wath, betwixt Ai&s;labie and Middleton &endq;St George, and the anchorage and plankage, and all other &s;um and &s;ums of money, duties and benefits, ari&s;ing, &amp;c. at the yearly rent of 20 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> under the benefits of which, the expences of the mayoralty are &s;u&s;tained.</Q></P></NOTE>.
<PB N="122" REF="176">Bi&s;hop Beke granted to the town of Stockton a weekly market on Wedne&s;day, and a fair once a year on the fea&s;t of the Tran&s;lation of Saint Thomas the Martyr, to continue eight whole days; <Q>&s;aving to him&s;elf, and his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors bi&s;hops of &startq;Durham, tolls and other rights and cu&s;toms of the &s;ame, as of other markets and fairs within the liberty of Durham: Dated at Stockton the eleventh day of May, 1310, of his patriarch&s;hip the fifth, and in the twenty-&s;eventh year of &endq;his con&s;ecration.</Q> It is ob&s;ervable we hear nothing of a body corporate or bur|ge&s;&s;es in this record. Bi&s;hop Matthew, by his confirmation charter, dated the fourth of June, 1602, &s;ets forth, that the market and fair &s;o granted to the town of Stockton had for &s;everal years been di&s;continued, &s;o that Stockton was de|crea&s;ing in con&s;equence before the demolition of the ca&s;tle. In this charter the town and borough of Stockton are &s;pecified, and Nicholas Fletham is named as being mayor petitioning for the &s;ame: The like re&s;ervation of tolls and duties is contained therein as in the original charter. The 24th of April, 1666, bi&s;hop Co&s;in confirmed the preceding charters.</P>

<P>An exact &s;urvey of the manor of Stockton, and of the townepps thereunto belonging, viz. Carleton, Norton and Stockton, and Hartburne, made and taken by Edward Col&s;ton and George Daile, gentleman, 1647. But the Court of Survey was begun by Thomas Saunders, Samuel Leigh, e&s;quire, and George Daile, gentleman, by virtue of a commi&s;&s;ion to them and us directed 18th of January, 1746, made from the honourable the tru&s;tees in the &s;aid commi&s;&s;ion named and authori&s;ed, with others, by 2 &s;everal ordinances of the High Court of Parliament, for the di&s;po&s;al of archbi&s;hopps and bi&s;hopps lands, throughout the whole kingdom of England and dominion of Wales. The jury enquire into &s;everall articles, and pre&s;ent with the &s;aid commi&s;&s;ioners as followeth, (viz.)</P>
<P>That the B'pp's Ca&s;tle, &s;ituate at the South end of the Towne of Stockton by the river Tea&s;e, is ruinous, and in great decay; that the River is Navigable, &amp; within 10 miles of the Mayne Sea.&mdash;That the towne of Stockton is an antient Burrough &amp; Markett towne by antient Charters, but the Markett un&s;erv'd of late, it &s;tanding very dirty in winter, formerly a fair for 8 days.</P>
<P>That the Country is a Champion Country, very fruitful, though a &s;tiff Clay.</P>
<P>That the Ca&s;tle hath had a great moate ab^t. it, but the &s;ame is now for want of clean&s;ing &s;illed up in part, &amp; within that moate hath heretofore been orchards &amp; gardens, but all de&s;troyed; there hath likewi&s;e been a Parke, but the &s;ame hath been di&s;parked.</P>
<P>That there belongeth to the &s;aid Ca&s;tle good deme&s;nes worth per ann. as it is now lett, 218 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> 1 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> 1 <ABBR>d.</ABBR> viz. a meadow or parke lying under the Ca&s;tle Wall, containing 26 acres, now lett for 19 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> 0 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> 4 <ABBR>d.</ABBR>&mdash;The Thornes, with the Intack &amp; hor&s;e clo&s;e, containing about thirty acres, &amp; the other ground ab^t. 20 acres, lett for 30 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> 2 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> 8 <ABBR>d.</ABBR>&mdash;The Park heads 45 acres, Little meadow field 40 acres, lett for 41 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> 9 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> 9 <ABBR>d.</ABBR>&mdash;The great Sumer field 130 acres, and Winter field. lett for 82 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> 18 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> 7 <ABBR>d.</ABBR>&mdash;Kel&s;oe Hill 40 acres, and Midnight Hole 40 acres, letten for 41 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> 9 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> 9 <ABBR>d.</ABBR>&mdash;Smithy Hill &amp; orchard, lying under the Ca&s;tle Wall, is now lett for 00 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> 10 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> 0 <ABBR>d.</ABBR>&mdash;All which amounts together to 218 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> 1 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> 1 <ABBR>d.</ABBR>&mdash;And by the te&s;timony of &s;everal upon oath the &s;ame is worth 280 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> 0 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> 0 <ABBR>d.</ABBR>&mdash;That there is no wood growing upon any part of it, or in that part of y^e Country; nor is there any Quarryes, Mynes, Parks, or Sheep Racks within the &s;aid Moate, ex|cept the Park above mentioned belonging to the B'pp.</P>
<P>That the B'pp has the royalties of the River of Tea&s;e, as Whales, Sturgeon, Porpoi&s;es or the like, taken on that &s;ide the River next the County of Durham within his mannor of Stockton, &amp; all wracks of the &s;ea, but know not what they are worth:&mdash;not 5 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> per ann.</P>
<P>That there is one Water Corne Milne called Norton Milne, w^ch we are informed the Ten^ts. of the &s;everall Townepps within the &s;aid mann'^r. (&s;ave only Carleton) are tyed to grind all their Corne at; &amp; that there belongeth to the &s;aid Milne 6 acres of meadow, the hay of which belongeth to the Ten^t of y^e. &s;^d. Milne, but the herbage thereof after the hay taken off belongeth to the Inh'itants of the Townepp of Norton, which &s;^d. Milne is lett by Lea&s;e unto Alice Arm&s;trong for 3 Lives.&mdash;And the Copyholders within the &s;^d. &s;everall Town&s;hipps by the Cu&s;tome of the &s;^d. mann'^r. are to repaire the &s;^d. Milne with Thatch &amp; Wall, &amp; to &s;cour the Race &amp; Dame, when need requireth; &amp; to fetch &s;uch timber from time to time from Clake wood near O&s;motherley or el&s;ewhere, within 12 miles di&s;tance from the &s;aid Milne, as al&s;o the Mil&s;tones for the u&s;e of the &s;^d. Milne from Raley-Green or Walker field, for which their &s;ervice every draught is to have 4 <ABBR>d.</ABBR> per mile, &amp; their Men's Dinners paid by the tenant: other Milnes we knowe of none within the &s;^d. mann. belonging to the B'pp.</P>
<P>That the &s;ev'rall Ten^ts. of the afore&s;^d. Townepps (viz.) Copyholders, are to do &s;uite and &s;ervice to the Lords Courts, &amp; to carry his provi&s;ion or hou&s;ehold &s;tuffe to Durham or B'pp Auckland from Stockton Ca&s;tle, (viz.) at 1 <ABBR>d.</ABBR> per Bu&s;hell for Corne, and 4 <ABBR>d</ABBR> per mile for every Draught, &amp; meat &amp; drinke for men and Cattle:&mdash;Wee dont know of any releif or heriott ever paid unto any B'pp after the death of any tenant.</P>
<P>That there is 60 Oxgangs of Land in Norton, the Owners whereof, at &s;uch times as the B'pp had his deme&s;nes at Stockton in his owne po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, did helpe to winn &amp; mowe the hay, or otherwi&s;e to pay the &s;ume of 40 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> in lieu thereof, y^e. &s;ervice being 60 days worke.&mdash;The Tenants of Hartburne pay yearly for &s;ervice &s;ilver 8 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> Stockton townepp for the like, 8 <ABBR>s.</ABBR></P>
<P>That the ffynes upon Death or Alienacon of Copyholders are certaine as we believe and not arbitrary, for that time out of mind the &s;everall Copyholders upon death or aliena'con have paid a certaine &s;ume to the Lord of this mann'^r. impo&s;ed upon them by the title of a Se&s;&s;e, w^ch hath been always certaine upon every tenant, although &s;ome le&s;s then the annual rent re&s;erved, and others the full rent re&s;erved, &amp; upon others more then the rent, but all the&s;e certaine, as appeareth by the &s;everall Copyes of one &amp; the &s;ame thing for many de&s;cents.</P>
<P>That the works, cu&s;toms, and &s;ervices of the Copyholders are little worth, and that we know of no Cot|tagers within this mann'^r.</P>
<P>That we know not what the p'fitts of the Courts, Way&s;es, Strayes, Felons goods, Wrecks of the &s;ea, Fynes, Amerciaments, or other the like Ca&s;ualtyes are worth per ann. unto the Lord.</P>
<P>That Warrens or Forre&s;ts the B'pp hath none within this mann'^r. But his Priviledges, Royaltyes, Fran|chi&s;es are great, as he had Jura Regalia within the County Palatine of Durham.</P>
<P>That the Lord hath the right of Pre&s;enta'con of the Vicaridge of Norton, and of the Chapelry of Stockton.</P>
<P>That there is belonging to the &s;aid Vicaridge Glebe lands worth 60 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> per ann. and the &s;ame is a mann'^r. and keepeth its Courts two times in the year, and oftener if he plea&s;e; and one Brough is the vicar there: his tithes are valued to be worth 40 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> per ann.&mdash;Hou&s;ing he hath very convenient, &amp; the &s;ame in rea&s;onable good repaire.</P>
<P>That the Liveing at Stockton is a poore pen'con not worth above per ann. 30 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> or 35 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> or thereabouts.</P>

The next year (1663), Mr Thomas Davi&s;on being collated to Norton, and de&s;irous to gratify the inhabitants of Stockton with a preacher, Mr Rudd gave up his &s;chool, and applied him&s;elf to preaching, for which he had an annual &s;alary of 26 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> and the &s;urplus fees, and &s;o he continued till 2d February, 1689, when Mr Davi&s;on was turned out for refu&s;ing to &s;wear allegiance to Wm and Mary. Mr Rudd was made vicar in his place; yet was he &s;o kind to his old worthy ma&s;ter, as that he freely permitted him to continue in the vicarage hou&s;e, and enjoy all the profits as formerly, he finding a curate, and only re&s;erving for him&s;elf the pro|fits &endq;of the chapelry of Stockton<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">In 1712, Mr Rudd was in&s;tituted to Long Newton, after he had mini&s;tred at Stockton 49 years and three months.&mdash;<HI>See Longnewton.</HI></NOTE>.</Q> Stockton chapel being by length of time ruinous, and much too little, and the inhabitants growing every day more nu|merous, the building of a new church became nece&s;&s;ary. A brief was read for the purpo&s;e of obtaining contributions, 21&s;t May, 1710; and on the 5th of June following, the foundation &s;tone was laid of an elegant new church, built of brick, embelli&s;hed with free-&s;tone, with a tower: It is regularly &s;talled with oak, has a good organ, and a ring of &s;ix mu&s;ical bells. This edifice was con&s;ecrated by bi&s;hop Crewe, 21&s;t Augu&s;t, 1712. In the 12th year of queen Anne, 1711, an act of Parliament was obtained to make Stockton, with Ea&s;t Hartburne and Pre&s;ton, a di&s;tinct and &s;eparate pari&s;h from Norton. The act &s;tates, that Stock|ton is an ancient corporation and borough, and by rea&s;on of its &s;ituation upon a navigable river not far from the &s;ea, becoming a place of good trade and com|merce, and very populous, in&s;tead of a ruinous chapel, the inhabitants had built a beautiful new church upon a parcel of the wa&s;te of the manor, near to the place where the ancient chapel &s;tood, &amp;c. It was thereby enacted, that there &s;hould be a vicar to have the care of &s;ouls of the inhabitants of &s;uch pari&s;h of Stockton, and a perpetual &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of vicars there, to have capacity and &s;ucce&s;&s;ion by the name of the vicar of the pari&s;h church of Stockton upon Tees, and be enabled to &s;ue and be &s;ued in that name in all courts and places of this realm, and &s;hould have and enjoy all tithes, offerings, oblations, obventions, mortuaries, and other eccle|&s;ia&s;tical benefits. That the patronage of the vicarage &s;hould belong to the bi&s;hops of Durham, and that they exerci&s;e all eccle&s;ia&s;tical juri&s;diction within that pari&s;h, and that the inhabitants be &s;ubject to the cu&s;toms and u&s;ages for the choice of church-wardens, over&s;eers of the poor, &s;urveyors of the highways, con&s;tables, and
<PB N="130" REF="184">other like pari&s;h-officers, as they had theretofore been. That there &s;hould be twelve ve&s;try-men to be cho&s;en, and have &s;ucce&s;&s;ion as therein directed, for the better rai&s;ing and a&s;certaining future taxes, a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ments, and contributions, for di&s;|charging debts contracted about building the church, buying bells, keeping the &s;ame in repair, and defraying the yearly expences of church-wardens, and paying 100 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> to the inhabitants of Norton in di&s;charge of all contributions towards Norton church, all ce&s;&s;es and taxes to the pari&s;h of Norton, as for expences touching the obtaining the &s;aid act. Then follow the rules for choo&s;ing the fir&s;t ve&s;try-men, to continue in office for the term of three years, with the method of electing &s;ucce&s;&s;ors in ca&s;e of death, and at the end of every three years a new &s;et of ve&s;try-men. And the act directs, that the mini&s;ter, church-wardens, and ve&s;try-men a&s;&s;embled, or the major part of them, &s;hould make by-laws, rules, orders, and directions for the good of the pari&s;h and better government thereof, the &s;ame to be ratified and confirmed by two ju&s;tices of the peace for the county; and &s;hould from time to time rate, tax, and a&s;&s;e&s;s all lands, tenements, hou&s;es, and per&s;onal e&s;tate in the &s;aid pari&s;h, as the major part of them &s;hould think ju&s;t and rea&s;onable, towards di&s;|charging the matters before noted, for building a ve&s;try-room, and making other improvements about the church, and keeping the &s;ame in repair; and for rai&s;ing a yearly &s;um, not exceeding 20 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> to be paid to the vicar for the time being, as an augmentation of his income; to be collected by the church-wardens; and, if need requires, to be levied by di&s;tre&s;s and &s;ale, by warrant from two ju&s;tices, with right of appeal to the quarter &s;e&s;&s;ions by per&s;ons aggrieved, where the &s;ame &s;hould be finally determined, and co&s;ts awarded. The lord bi&s;hop was thereby im|powered to grant to the vicar, without any fine, a parcel of wa&s;te ground near the alms-hou&s;e, of the yearly value of 20 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> or thereabouts, and any other wa&s;te ground in the manor, not exceeding the yearly value of 20 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> And it was thereby al&s;o enac|ted, that the vicar &s;hould hold the parcel of wa&s;te ground adjoining to the church-yard on the ea&s;t &s;ide thereof, the &s;ame being intended for a place for a hou&s;e to be built upon for the vicar<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Bi&s;hop Chandler, by will, le&s;t a &s;um of money to purcha&s;e a hou&s;e for the vicar, to which the tru&s;tees under bi&s;hop Crewe's will gave 50 <ABBR>l</ABBR> in June, 1750.</NOTE>.

<P>In Mr Rudd's time, and by his pious endeavours, an alms-hou&s;e or ho&s;pital was erected, and a fund rai&s;ed for the &s;upport of &mdash; poor people. The principal benefactors thereto were, Mrs Margaret Bailey, from whom the Rai&s;becks are

<P>In 1721, a charity &s;chool for twenty boys was in&s;tituted by voluntary contribu|tions, and in 1759 &s;ixteen girls were added; and the fund is now &s;o much in|crea&s;ed, as at this time to &s;upport a ma&s;ter, a mi&s;tre&s;s, twenty boys, and &s;ixteen girls; who are all cloathed, taught to read, write, and ca&s;t up accounts; and are taken in at the age of &s;even, and continued to the age of fourteen years. In 1729, certain lands called Lu&s;tram and Elwick Mire, in the town&s;hip of Stockton, were purcha&s;ed for the purpo&s;es of this charity for 670 <ABBR>l.</ABBR>; and in 1767, &s;ix copy|hold clo&s;es near the town of Stockton were purcha&s;ed for 16$5 <ABBR>l</ABBR>&mdash;The ma&s;ter's &s;alary was originally 20 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> a year, and 12 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> a year was added when the go|verne&s;s for the girls was fir&s;t appointed, out of which the ma&s;ter was to pay her &s;tipend.</P>

<P>The trade and importance of Stockton rapidly increa&s;ing; in order to render the approach more commodious from Cleveland, in the year 17$$ an act of parlia|ment was obtained for building a toll-bridge acro&s;s the river, a little below the old ferry-boat landing; a compen&s;ation is made to the bi&s;hop and his le&s;&s;ee for the lo&s;s of the $erry. The bridge, which is an elegant &s;tructure, was fini&s;hed in April 1771, and con&s;i&s;ts of five arches; the &s;pan of the center arch is 72 feet, the two next 60 feet; and the two end arches 44 feet each; the width of the bridge between the walls is 18 feet; the whole erection, with the road at the ends, co&s;t 8000 <ABBR>l.</ABBR>; rai&s;ed by &s;ub&s;cription, and made, by virtue of the act, a funded debt, entitled to all the benefits of increa&s;ed profits.</P>

<P>In 1660, the whole town did not contain above 120 families.&mdash;In 1666, there were in the town and borough only 136 families, poor and rich.&mdash;In 1692, there were 350 families be&s;ides the poor, &s;o that in 26 years there was an increa&s;e of 214 families; and 1725, there was 430 be&s;ides the poor, which at lea&s;t were 100 more. And by an accurate calculation, made in the year 1780, the town con|tained 1040 families; and in 1781, there &s;tood in the collector's books 478 hou&s;es, which paid window duty, exclu&s;ive of empty hou&s;es and tho&s;e not charged.

He left four daughters his coheire&s;&s;es, by whom the lord&s;hips of Din&s;dale and Middleton One Row, with the man&s;ion-hou&s;e at Din&s;dale, and a &s;almon fi&s;hery in the river Tees, were &s;old to John Lambton, <ABBR>e&s;q</ABBR> of Lamb|ton Hall, in the year 1770, for 15,000 <ABBR>l.</ABBR></P>
<P>It has been ob&s;erved to us, that <Q>the bi&s;hops of Durham formerly came down &startq;by Upper Din&s;dale, where are the remains of an intrenchment or mote of &s;ome old habitation (in which place Mr Ward found &s;everal antiquities), cro&s;&s;ed the Tees over a wooden bridge there, the foundations of the piers of which are &s;till vi&s;ible, and &s;o to Middleton, where there are intrenchments or &s;ome works of &endq;defence<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">From the notes of Mr Robert Culley, late of Denton, decea&s;ed.
<P>[&rindx; Mr Francis Place, of Din&s;dale, a younger &s;on of Mr Rowland Place of the &s;ame place, was put clerk to an attorney in London, where he continued till 1665; in which year, going accidentally into a &s;hop, the officers came to &s;hut up the hou&s;e, on its having the plague in it. This occa&s;ioned his leaving London, and gave him an opportunity of quitting a profe&s;&s;ion that was contrary to his inclination, and of following the roving life he loved, and the arts for which he had talents. He painted, de&s;igned, and etched. Ver|tue had heard that he had learned the latter of Hollar, and has pre&s;erved a letter that he received from Mr Place in an&s;wer to his enquiries into that fact, and about Hollar him&s;elf, of whom he relates to his own knowledge many particulars which Vertue had in&s;erted in his life of that arti&s;t, but denies his having been in&s;tructed by him. Ra. Thore&s;by, in his Ducatus Leodien&s;is, often mentions Mr Place with great encomi|ums, and &s;pecifies various pre&s;ents that he made to his mu&s;eum. He tells us too, that Mr place di&s;covered an earth for, and a method of making porcelain, which he put in practice at the man&s;ion-hou&s;e of York, of which manufacture he gave Thore&s;by a fine mug. (This pottery co&s;t him much money: He attempted it &s;olely from a turn to experiment, but one Clifton, of Pontefract, took the hint from him, and made a fortune by it.) From the &s;ame account we learn, that Mr Place di&s;covered porphyry at Mount Sorril, in Leice&s;ter&s;hire, of which he had a piece to grind colours on. This author &s;pecifies views of Tinmouth ca&s;tle and light-hou&s;e, the cathedral of York, churches and pro&s;pects of Leeds, drawn and etched; and a mezzotinto of Henry Gyles the gla&s;s painter, executed by Mr Place. He al&s;o$&s;craped three plates of John Moy&s;er, <ABBR>e&s;q</ABBR> of Beverley, his particular friend; of Thomas Comber, dean of Durham; and of bi&s;hop Crewe; the la&s;t is finely executed. Many &s;ketches of ca&s;tles and views which he took in Wales, and of va|rious other places in England, Scotland, and Ireland, &s;everal of them well fini&s;hed, are extant, and have been engraved: A view of Scarborough ca&s;tle was drawn as late as the year 1715. His prints are very &s;carce; he &s;eldom re&s;ided in London, and drew only for his amu&s;ement, &s;eldom compleating what he undertook; and in his rambles painting, drawing, and engraving occa&s;ionally. In the reign of Cha. II. he was offered a pen&s;ion of 500 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> a year to draw the royal navy, but declined accepting it, as he could not endure confinement or dependance. In Thore&s;by's Topography of Leeds are &s;ome churches drawn by Place, al&s;o &s;everal views in Drake's Eboracum. Ames mentions a print by him, which I have, of Rich. Thomp&s;on, from a painting of Zou&s;t; it is boldly done; Another is of Sterne, archbi&s;hop of York. He did &s;ome plates of birds, viz. &s;even from the drawings of Barlow, and the figures for Godartius's book of infects. He &s;craped a &s;ine mezzotinto of his friend and relation Philip Woolrich<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr Place was capital in drawing portraits in crayons; Mr Allan has the original drawing of Mr Woolrich, and al&s;o the mezzotinto print &s;craped from it, together with that of Charles the Fir&s;t, a piece of the Goo&s;eberties, and many other of his crayon drawings.

<P>Still pur&s;uing the cour&s;e of the river Tees, we enter the pari&s;h of SOCKBURN, which comprehends only the manor of that name. Leland's de&s;cription of it<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Itin. v. 1, p. 77.</NOTE> carries a competent idea of the place: <Q>Sokburne where as the elde&s;t hou&s;e is of &startq;the Coniers, with the demains about it, of a mile cumpace of exceding plea&s;aunt &endq;ground, is almo&s;t made an i&s;le, as Te&s;e ryver windeth about it.</Q> The oppo&s;ite lands on the York&s;hire &s;hore ri&s;e &s;wiftly from the river, and form a beau|tiful amphitheatre.

He affected an appearance of infidelity in religious matters (the folly of many mathematicians), and was an example to the vulgar not a little reprehen&s;ible.

The chancel is four paces in width and &s;even in length, lighted to the ea&s;t by a window of three parts under a circular arch, and one window to the &s;outh; it is &s;eparated from the nave by a heavy circular arch. In the &s;outh wall near the altar is an arched rece&s;s, but no effigy or in&s;cription. The nave is fifteen paces in length and &s;ix in width. There is a porch to the &s;outh called Claxton's Porch, containing a large window that gives light to the whole nave. On an altar tomb are two elegant figures in alaba&s;ter of a man and his wife, recumbent, &s;uppo&s;ed to be of the Claxton family; the hands are elevated; the legs are extended, re&s;ting the feet on &s;ome animal, but &s;o mutilated and bedaubed with wa&s;h as not to be di&s;tin|gui&s;ed whether a dog or a lion. As the heire&s;s of the Horden family of Conyers
<PB N="162" REF="220">intermarried with Claxton, and carried with her the large po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, as well of the Conyers as Langtons, ancient lords of Redmar&s;hall, and from the name of the porch where the tomb &s;tands, it is probable the per&s;ons repre&s;ented were Clax|tons. The tower of the church is &s;o much di&s;proportioned to the &s;ize of the edifice, and &s;o di&s;&s;imilar in its con&s;truction, that it carries evidence of its being originally built as a place of defence: Yet in 1462, Adam Morland, then rector, fortified the rectory-hou&s;e; the tower of which, with embra&s;ures, remains to this time.</P>

<HEAD>The Pari&s;h of <HI>BISHOPTON.</HI></HEAD>
<P>Proceeding we&s;tward, the next adjoining pari&s;h is BISHOPTON. In Lambarde's Dictionary, and the Chronicle of Lindisfarne, Bi&s;hopton is thus mentioned, <Q>&startq;Bi$copton a village in the bi&s;hoprike of Durham wheare one Roger Conyers a nobleman of that countrie, in tyme of kinge Stephen re&s;i&s;tid one William Cumyn an ambitious prelate, which &s;ought by forcible and warlike meanes to invade the &s;ea, and to have compelled the monkes of Durham to have elected him after Gaufride (which died about the yeare 1136) their by&s;hop, which bycau&s;e they refu&s;ed to do, he be&s;eiged, &s;acked &amp; &s;poiled not only th' abbey, but the towne of Durham al&s;o, withe &s;uche crueltie &amp; exqui&s;ite tor|mortes of deathe again&s;t &s;uche as re&s;i&s;ted him, as &s;car&s;ely is the like to be found eyther in the Scottes or Danes them&s;elves, which have after a mo&s;t barbarous &s;ort often tymes heryed that quarter, howbeit, in th' end, he bothe lo&s;t his de|&s;yre &amp; was compelled by the nobilitie of the country (armed for that purpo&s;e) to &s;ubmitte him&s;elfe to the lawfully elect, who&s;e name was William al&s;o; what|&s;oever &endq;the cau&s;e was it is named of the by&s;hop.</Q> The reader will revert to the fir&s;t vol. p. 161, for a full account of Cumyn's procedure. The &s;eat of Roger Coniers (a per&s;on of great power in the twelfth century), was at Bi&s;hopton, a fine elevated &s;ituation, and in a plentiful corn country; but what is mo&s;t remarkable is, that though the village &s;tands on high ground inclining to the &s;outh-ea&s;t, and the church is built on an eminence in the center, where the ground, &s;trong by nature, was ea&s;ily fortified; yet the place cho&s;en for the &s;trong-hold where Coniers defended him&s;elf again&s;t the troops of the u&s;urper of the See, is a flat a little di&s;tance ea&s;t of the village, and overlooked by the whole adjacent eminence: This &s;ituation could be cho&s;en for no other apparent natural cau&s;e, than that water could be obtained there to &s;ill the trenches. The plain is very narrow, but the whole ground mar&s;hy. To give the reader &s;ome idea of the mode of fortification in tho&s;e days, the following &s;ketch exhibits a de&s;ign or ground plot of this impregnable fortre&s;s, and we have al&s;o given a view of the elevation. The crown of the mount
<PB N="163" REF="221">
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE> is almo&s;t level; from north to &s;outh ten paces wide, and &s;ixteen paces from ea&s;t to we&s;t; the circumference of the mount at the foot, as proved in the fir&s;t ditch, is two hundred paces: To the north the ground is mar&s;hy, and capable of &s;upply|ing the trenches with water, they being nearly level with each other; to the &s;outh the ground ri&s;es gently: The village of Bi&s;hopton is to the we&s;t. The elevation of
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE> the mount is about &s;ixty perpendicular feet; the pro&s;pect from the &s;ummit is con|fined, &s;ave only to the north-ea&s;t: The crown of the hill hath no marks of build|ings, &s;o that the few people that could be placed thereon, notwith&s;tanding &s;uch brea&s;t-works as they had, would not be &s;ecure. Perhaps this was a dernier re&s;ort; yet troops driven within the brea&s;t-works and circunvallations might be annoyed by the engines of an enemy; and even a &s;trong bow would carry an arrow with force from the plain without the ditches to the &s;ummit.</P>

We find little in the records touch|ing the vill of Elton, &s;ave what is noted relating to the right of pre&s;entation to this rectorial church, whereby it appears, that the manor with the advow&s;on was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by tenants in common, perhaps by having de&s;cended to females &s;o early as 1435. In 1378, the e&s;tate had de&s;cended to Thomas the &s;on of Sir William Gower, knt. who&s;e widow pre&s;ented the la&s;t rector, and Thomas's guardian,
<PB N="166" REF="224">during his minority, pre&s;ented in his right. In 1435, (Percebride the rector, pre&s;ented by the Gower family, being dead) by an inqui&s;ition it is &s;tated, that Will. Bowes, of Dalden, had two &s;ucce&s;&s;ive turns, and the right of pre&s;enting was then in him. In 1571, Sir Geo. Bowes, of Daldon, knt. being dead, Cuthbert Collingwood, of E&s;lington, in the county of Northumberland, and Dorothy his wife, one of Sir George's daughters and coheire&s;&s;es, pre&s;ented a clerk. It appears afterwards, that John Errington, of Wor&s;all, gentleman, had &s;uch right of pre|&s;entation as formerly appertained to the Bowes's; and John Jeffer&s;on, <ABBR>e&s;q</ABBR> in 1662, excerci&s;ed &s;uch right as had appertained to the Gowers: This proportion de&s;cended to Mi&s;s Ann Jeffer&s;on, who intermarried with Mr Tho. Hogg, of Durham, who&s;e &s;on and heir, John Hogg, <ABBR>e&s;q</ABBR> of the Inner Temple, now po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;es it. The e&s;tate of the Erringtons was purcha&s;ed by Sir Robert Shafto, knt. recorder of Newca&s;tle on Tyne, in 1682, and it is now ve&s;ted in Rob. Shafto, of Whitworth, <ABBR>e&s;q</ABBR> his lineal de&s;cendant, who has two turns, and Mr Hogg one turn in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion in the right of pre&s;entation.</P>

In the fir&s;t in&s;tance, we have not the lea&s;t evidence to prove the Baliols ever had any po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions here; in the next place, the grant to St Mary's being connected with that of Gainford, a place &s;o greatly di&s;tant, and in no in&s;tance united thereto, renders the evidence &s;u&s;picious. The po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of the Baliols lay in the north-we&s;t part of the county, where there is a Stainton lying on the High-&s;treet or Roman Road, and might con&s;e|quently be called Stainton in le Strata, as well as Street-le-ham have its name from the &s;ame cau&s;e. We beg the reader will &s;u&s;pend his judgment on this matter until he has compared the evidence pre&s;ented under the &s;ubject of Stainton, in the chapelry of Barnardca&s;tle; where he will ob&s;erve there was an|ciently a dependent chapelry under Gainford, and Gainford, with all its dependent chapels, was given by the Baliols to St Mary's. It is not to be doubted this church belonged to St Mary's, but how it came to that mona&s;tery is difficult to determine.

<P>Advancing to the we&s;tward, we enter that part of the pari&s;h of HAUGHTON which lies in Stockton ward, and comprehends the chapelry of Sadberge, with other town&s;hips.</P>
<P>Much has been &s;aid of SADBERGE in the progre&s;s of this work, to which the reader will revert, in order to prevent repetition. It was anciently a county, and
<PB N="173" REF="231">had its proper &s;heriffs, coroners, and other civil officers; and there the &s;heriff held his tourn. A court of a&s;&s;ize was held there by the ju&s;tices itinerant, commi&s;&s;ioned by the bi&s;hops of Durham. It was in di&s;tant antiquity, and &s;till is, &s;aid to be a local earldom; in the time of bi&s;hop Bury, divided into two wards, the ea&s;t and we&s;t ward: Sadberge had the privileges of a wapentake. In the laws of Edward
<PB N="174" REF="232">the Confe&s;&s;or it is written, <HI>Et quod Angli vocant Hundredum, &s;upradicti comitatus vocant Wapentachium:</HI> Hoveden derives it, <HI>a tactu armorum;</HI> and de&s;cribes the ceremony, <HI>cum quis accipiebat praefecturam wapentachij die &s;tatuto in loco ubi con|&s;ucverant congregari, omnes majores contra eum conveniebant, et de&s;cendente de equo &s;uo, omnes a&s;&s;urgebant ei.

In the pleas of quo war|ranto, in the time of Edward I. it was certified, that the bi&s;hop had his coroner of Sadberge. A court of pleas was al&s;o held at Sadberge, and fines were regu|larly levied there of lands within that liberty<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Haec e&s;t finalis concordia facta in curia domini <HI>Dunelmen&s;is</HI> epi&s;copi apud <HI>Sadberge</HI> die mercurii proxima ante &s;e&s;tum &s;ancti Laurencii Martyris anno regni <HI>Henrici</HI> regis Anglioe et Franciae <HI>&s;exti</HI> po&s;t conque&s;tum vice&s;imo &s;eptimo et pontificatus domini <HI>Roberti</HI> epi&s;copi Dunelmen&s;is anno duodecimo coram <HI>Willielmo Nevill</HI> Dom. de Fauconberge, <HI>Thoma Nevill, Thoma Lumley, Willielmo Eure, Thoma Fulthorpe,</HI> militibus; <HI>Johanne Pockyngton, Roberto Beaumont,</HI> clerico; <HI>Roberto Danby, Chri&s;tophoro Boynton, Johanne Lounde,</HI> cler|ico; <HI>Willielmo Rackett,</HI> et <HI>Ricardo Wenden,</HI> ju&s;ticiariis ip&s;ius epi&s;copi apud <HI>Sadberge.</HI> Et preterea &s;cilicet die lunae proxima po&s;t &s;e&s;tum &s;ancte Luciae Virginis anno regni regis praedictae vice&s;imo octavo et ponti&s;icatus dicti domini epi&s;copi anno duodecimo &s;upradictae coram ei&s;dem ju&s;ticiariis et aliis dicti domini epi&s;copi &s;idelibus tune ibi pre&s;entibus ibidem conce&s;&s;a et recordata inter <HI>Willelmum Blackwell</HI> capellanum <HI>Thomam de Baines</HI> et <HI>Thomam Counden Querentem</HI> et <HI>Thomam Norman</HI> de <HI>Novo Ca&s;tro &s;uper Tynam</HI> et <HI>Margaretam</HI> uxorem ejus <HI>de&s;orcientes</HI> de duobus m$&s;&s;uagiis et &s;exaginta acris terrae cum pertinenciis in <HI>Cotom Amundeville</HI> unde placitum convencionis &s;ummonitum &s;uit inter eos in cadem curia, &s;cilicet, &amp;c.</NOTE>. Mr Mickleton points out one in the fifth year of Edward II. the record was in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Sir William Chaytor, of Croft. In the time of bi&s;hop Langley it was a&s;&s;erted, that Barnard|ca&s;tle, Marwood, Cleatlam, Eggle&s;ton, Langton, Middleton in Tee&s;dale, New|biggin, Stainton, and other places in the we&s;tern extremity of the county of Durham, were members of this wapentake. There was a gaol for pri&s;oners in Sadberge; and &s;undry manors and lands were held by the &s;pecial &s;ervice of maintaining the &s;ame, and &s;upporting the pri&s;oners. The bailiffs common fee was 40 <ABBR>s.</ABBR></P>
<P>In Lambarde's Dictionary, p. 324, this place is noted as follows, <Q>Satbergia &startq;in Chron. Lindisf." After &s;peaking of the &s;ale to bi&s;hop Pud&s;ey, he adds, This Satberge was at that tyme and longe &s;ence called a countye, conteyninge (as I thinke) the greate&s;t portion of that which we now calle the by&s;hopricke of Durham. I heare of &s;ome gentlemen of that quarter, that theare be dyvers fines yet extant, acknowledged before the bi&s;hop in his court of Satberge, and that the mo&s;t part of the countrye re&s;orted to courte thyther, which gyveth me
<PB N="175" REF="233">to thinke, that it &s;hould be called SACBERGE of Sac and byrig (the Saxon wordes), which &s;ignifie the court of cau&s;es or plees, from which &s;ignification Socburgh before is not muche different. It &s;tandethe upon a hil, and is now called Sedbergh, which Bergh (the latter part of the worde) &s;oundeth as much in the Saxon as Hyll now with us in Ingli&s;he, and thereof if any man like better to have it deryved of Sacbeosh, that is the court upon the hyl, or the hyll of plees, I give him as free libertie as I my&s;elfe would be gladd to enjoye in any &s;uch matter of conjecture. Matt. Paris calleth it Segefield, which is a large town within the bi&s;hopricke, and therefore belike, king Richard gave &endq;the by&s;hop that al&s;o.</Q></P>
<P>The village of Sadberge is now an in&s;ignificant place, compared to its ancient con&s;equence; it &s;tands on the crown of a fine eminence, which ri&s;es with an ea&s;y a&s;cent from every &s;ide to &s;uch an elevation, that it commands an exten&s;ive pro&s;pect over the &s;outh-ea&s;t part of the county of Durham, and up Tee&s;dale as far as the high grounds above Barnardca&s;tle, but of no great di&s;tance northward; and is a di&s;tinct object from the environs of Raby, Kirkmerrington, Quarrington, and Hartlepool. The ground on which the pre&s;ent chapel &s;tands is mo&s;t elevated, and appears to have been forced, and is trenched round; from whence it may be pre&s;umed that there &s;tood the ca&s;tle, gaol, and court-hou&s;e in ancient times. The &s;tones of which the chapel is built appear to have been taken from ancient &s;tructures; for &s;uch materials are very &s;carce in that part of the country, the com|mon edifices being chiefly of brick. In bi&s;hop Hatfield's Survey, we find that all the lands were held by military &s;ervice; &s;o noble a po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion was Sadberge anciently! Will. Fawcon held four burgages and thirty acres and a half of land in the fields there by fealty and &s;uit of court, from three weeks to three weeks, and paying a double relief; and he, with others, holding lands within the wapen|take, (to wit) the baron of Gray&s;tock, the priore&s;s of Ne&s;eham, Robert de Ogles, Walter Taylboys, I&s;abell the wife of John Percy de Kildale, John de A&s;|layby, the heirs of Alex. Surteys, and others, had the keeping of the gaol and pri&s;on, and were an&s;werable for the e&s;cape of pri&s;oners. There were forty-one, together with Fawcon, who held eighty-four burgages and lands under the &s;ame tenure. Be&s;ides the ancient burgagers there were new ones &s;pecified in the Survey. The deme&s;ne lands are &s;tated to con&s;i&s;t of twenty-three oxgangs, each containing &s;ixteen acres.</P>
<P>After what has been &s;tated from Hatfield's Survey, we mu&s;t note, that many &s;mall proprietors of lands are found in the inqui&s;itions po&s;t mortem, and other records in the bi&s;hop's offices; to go through which in a cour&s;e of de&s;cents would be at once laborious and unprofitable. Among tho&s;e are named, in bi&s;hop Beaumont's time, Kays and Mortons; in bi&s;hop Bury's time, Mar&s;halls, Chib|burns, and Lucas of Norton; in bi&s;hop Hatfield's time, Le Wrays, Waryns, Sherwynds, Hack&s;mall, Bedales, Huwet&s;ons, Ings, and &s;undry others; the Wrays and Mar&s;halls held their lands for many generations. From all the&s;e records it appears, that the burgages were held in free borough tenure, by &s;ervice at the bo|rough court; and the lands by military &s;ervice, and in &s;occage<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>For note, &s;ee following page</HI><NOTE N="&para;" PLACE="foot">&mdash; Ca&s;&s;on ad Willo de Maundeby.

The indu&s;trious and &s;agacious David Ca&s;ley, in his Catalogue of MSS. in the King's Library, has, be&s;ides the&s;e, &s;hewn us a way to compute the age of a MS. even by the different methods of writing in different times, and the different characters and abbreviations: and he &s;ays, that he has &s;tudied the age of MSS. &s;o much, and has &s;o often compared MSS. without, with tho&s;e that have happened to have dates, that he has little doubt as to that particular; nay, as by looking in people's faces, mo&s;t men are able to gue&s;s right, that this per&s;on is 40, that about 50, and another about 60, without being able to give any rea&s;on for tho&s;e gue&s;&s;es, &s;o he thinks that by frequent in&s;pections, he has attained the faculty of gue&s;&s;ing the age of MSS.; and that even before he &s;earches more narrowly for certain <GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> for their age.

John Capellanus de Cotum conveyed and confirmed to Rickenhall and his wife, all his lands and tenements there; and Thomas, the &s;on of Thomas de Skyrmingham, conveyed to Alane de Cun&s;clive his lands in Cotum and Riccondale. By an inqui&s;ition <HI>po&s;t mortem,</HI> taken on the death of Ralph de Rickenhall, in the 16th year of Bi&s;hop Hatfield, it is &s;tated, that he held of the bi&s;hop in capite, certain me&s;&s;uages and lands at Coatham by homage, fealty, and &s;uit of court, from three weeks to three weeks, rendering to the lord a pound of cumin; al&s;o held of Alicia Surtees and Thomas de Gray&s;tanes other lands, rendering a pound of cumin, and <HI>unum par. &s;erotecarum,</HI> and 6 <ABBR>d.</ABBR> rent; and al&s;o of Robert de Skyrmingham other lands there, of 12 <ABBR>d.</ABBR> rent.

<HEAD>THE PARISH OF DARLINGTON.</HEAD>
<P>TO the we&s;t of Haughton, lies the pari&s;h of Darlington. The town of DARLINGTON, which gives name to one of the four wards of the county, is a large and populous place, &s;tands on the &s;ide of an hill, gently inclining to the ca&s;t, with &s;everal &s;treets, which are called Norgate, Briggate, and Backwellgate, branching out from the great &s;quare, or main body of the town, where the market is held; one that runs parallel with the high part of the &s;quare, called Skinnergate, and another parallel with the &s;outh row, called Hungate.<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">The Bullweand leads from the market-place to Hungate, and is &s;o called from the figure of a bull placed again&s;t the corner hou&s;e, which anciently belonged to the Bulmer family, who&s;e cognizance was a bull pa&s;&s;ant.</NOTE> The high row of the &s;quare is on an elevated &s;ituation, and commands a plea&s;ant pro&s;pect to the ea&s;t. At the foot of the &s;quare &s;tands the church, an elegant Gothic fabric; and near thereto, a &s;tone bridge, of three arches,<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Formerly of nine arches&mdash;lately rebuilt with three arches.</NOTE> over the river Skern, communicating with the great roads to Stockton and Yarm.</P>
<P>This town is &s;urrounded with &s;ome of the be&s;t lands in the county, and con&s;e|quently the market is &s;uperior in the articles of corn, cattle, &s;heep, and wool, to many in the north of England. There is a large manufactory carried on here, in
<PB N="184" REF="242">the lower woollen &s;tuffs, called tammeys, moreens, harateens, chineas, and other articles, in which the long wool is u&s;ed, this being an abundant market for that &s;pecies of wool. Al&s;o a great manufactory, of dama&s;ks, diapers, huckabacks, checks, and &s;heet cloth, with other linens: it is computed, that no le&s;s than 1000 looms are con&s;tantly employed here, which, with the attendant articles of the trade, occa&s;ions daily work for multitudes of dyers, &s;pinners, combers, and children, who wind the thread and yarn. The happine&s;s of this &s;ituation for a manufac|tory is, that the inhabitants are abundantly &s;upplied with all the nece&s;&s;aries of life from the adjacent country, at a cheap rate, and the influx of foreign money brought hither by labour and the &s;taples of the country, pa&s;&s;es not away for the maintenance of the people, into di&s;tant parts; but it is expended with the neighbouring farmers, and they return it back upon the &s;hops, and &s;o, in a con|tinued vortex, the accummulated wealth circulates to enrich the town and its vicinity.</P>
<P>Darlington is a place of antiquity, and a borough by pre&s;cription under the Bi&s;hop of Durham: &s;oon after the epi&s;copal &s;eat was &s;ettled at Durham, we are told, that Styr, &s;on of Ulphus,<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Lel.

To the great and powerful prelate, HUGH PUDSEY, the pre&s;ent &s;tructure owes its origin: the bi&s;hop, as ob|&s;erved, was under the frown of his &s;overeign, for the &s;uppo&s;ed offence of having extorted great &s;ums of money from the &s;ubjects of his palatinate, on pretence of redeeming the king from captivity, which he put into his own coffe$s: guilty of &s;uch a tre&s;pa&s;s on the public, (if the fact was &s;o) he was highly imprudent in pro|ceeding at that period in &s;uch magnificent works, for he was then building this

<P>This church is in the form of a cro&s;s, with the tower and &s;pire ri&s;ing in the centre. The elegant &s;pire being &s;truck by lightning, Tue&s;day the 17th of July, 1750, was &s;o &s;hattered, as to render it nece&s;&s;ary to have the upper part of it taken down; in rebuilding it, the ma&s;on omitted the old ornaments, the rolls at the angles, which deprive it of much beauty. The chancel is eleven paces in length, and &s;even in width; the a&s;cent to the altar is by three &s;teps: three &s;talls in the &s;outh wall for the officiating mini&s;ters, ri&s;e above each other in gradation towards the ea&s;t: in the north wall is a &s;pacious rece&s;s, a place a&s;&s;igned for the monument of &s;ome di&s;tingui&s;hed per&s;onage. The chancel, below the rails, is neatly &s;talled with oak, having nine &s;eats on each &s;ide. It was originally lighted on each &s;ide by two tiers of windows, three above and three below, at equal di&s;tances, orna|mented with round pila&s;ters and arches of various members, &s;ome of the capitals foliated: the ea&s;t end is modern; has four lights, which, being very different from the old windows, injures the beauty of the building. The chancel is &s;eparated from the nave by a low pointed arch, with three ribs, like bridge-work, two paces deep; the roof is &s;upported by a blunt pointed arch, &s;et with diamond|cut &s;tuds. The old rood-loft is converted into a gallery. The nave is in length thirty paces, and fifteen in width, with a tran&s;ept, or cro&s;s aile, twenty-&s;ix paces in length, and five in width, both limbs of which are exactly &s;imilar: the tower ri&s;es in the centre, from four clu&s;tered pillars, &s;upporting uniform arches, and forming a &s;quare of &s;ix paces: the &s;ide ailes have each three pillars, exclu&s;ive of tho&s;e of the tower, &s;upporting blunt-pointed arches, on one &s;ide the fir&s;t column is round, the &s;econd octagonal, the third clu&s;tered; on the other &s;ide, the fir&s;t
<PB N="187" REF="246">octagonal, the &s;econd round, the third clu&s;tered. The centre of the nave has four lights on each &s;ide; the roof is ceiled. The &s;ide ailes open into the tran&s;ept by a pointed arch, ornamented with a variety of filletings; they are uniformly lighted by three windows, each having low round arches within, and a &s;quare moulding without. The ends of the tran&s;ept are uniformly lighted by two upper and two lower windows, ornamented with &s;mall round pila&s;ters, belted in the middle, and various rolls in the archings; in each limb are two upper windows and two lower windows to the ea&s;t and we&s;t. The we&s;t door is highly fini&s;hed with archings and pila&s;ters, cylindrical and octagonal interchangeably. There are &s;ix mu&s;ical bells in the tower. The church is kept in good order, but the inward appearance is greatly hurt by irregular pews and galleries.</P>
<P>There were four chauntries in this church, but by whom or when founded, we have no information.

<P>Bolden Book<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Alias Buke.</NOTE> is the fir&s;t record in which Darlington is particularly noted; and it informs us, there were forty oxgangs of land there, in the hands of villain tenants, for each of which the lord received five &s;hillings: their &s;ervice con&s;i&s;ted of mow|ing
<PB N="188" REF="247">the bi&s;hop's meadows, winning and leading the hay, for which work they received a corody; inclo&s;ing the limits of the court, from whence the term, <HI>"The verge of the court,"</HI> &s;eems to be derived; working at the mill, bringing one load of wood for every oxgang, and carrying the bi&s;hop's baggage on his circuit, and al&s;o carrying yearly three loads of wine, herrings and &s;alt. There were twelve tenants who each held an oxgang of land, and paid rent as the villains, but did not perform the like &s;ervices: yet &s;erved on the bi&s;hop's amba&s;&s;ies. O&s;bertus Bate, and Wybert's &s;ons, held lands under the la&s;t-mentioned duties, &amp;c. The &s;mith held viij acres, for iron-work about the carts of Little Walton, and for &s;mall iron|works within Darlington court. The cottage-men &s;erved to make the ricks of hay, bear in the corn, and repair the mills. The pinder held nine acres of land, and had his thraves like others in that office, and provided five&s;core hens and five hundred eggs for the hou&s;ehold. The mills of Darlington, Haughton, and Ketton, paid thirty marks. The burgagers, dyers, and <HI>fermes,</HI> rendered ten marks.

<P>The bi&s;hop's palace was placed clo&s;e upon the banks of the river Skerne: Bi&s;hop Co&s;ins re&s;tored this hou&s;e, it having then become very ruinous; it has been totally neglected within this la&s;t century, and is now farmed by the town of the bi&s;hop's hou&s;ekeeper, (who holds it by patent for life) as a workhou&s;e for their poor.</P>
<P>Few hi&s;torical facts occur here: King Edward I. 1291, was at Darlington, and i&s;&s;ued from thence his &s;ummons to fifty-&s;even of the chief military tenants of the north.

<P>It is ob&s;erved before, that there was a chauntry in Darlington church, called Mar&s;hall's Chauntry, the endowment of which, we pre&s;ume, was ample; the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions belonging to it remained in the crown, from the time of the di&s;&s;olution, till the reign of Queen Elizabeth, when the inhabitants of Darlington, &s;en&s;ible of the great utility of a liberal education to ri&s;ing generations, applied to Henry Earl of We&s;tmorland, then in great power, and Bi&s;hop Pilkington, to u&s;e their intere&s;t at court, for obtaining the foundation of a grammar &s;chool, which the queen was graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed to grant, by her charter, dated the 15th of June, 1567, endow|ing the &s;ame with lands and tenements at Darlington and Heighington, in this county, and Thornaby, in the county of York, formerly the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of Mar&s;hall's Chauntry.

This hill probably was puffed up by &s;ubterraneous fires, like that in the Lucrine Lake, now called Monte-novo; but what has filled up the cha&s;m &endq;cau&s;ed by its &s;inking, or divided it into different cavities, it is not ea&s;y to &s;ay.</Q> There are other ancient authors who &s;peak of the&s;e pits in the like manner. In Leland's Itin. vol. VI. it is noted, <Q>that Doctor Bella&s;is told him, that a &startq;dukke, markid after the fa&s;cion of dukkes of the bi&s;hoprike of Dure&s;me, was put in into one of the pooles called Hel Ketelles, betwixt Darlington and Te&s;ebank, and after was found at **** bridge, upon Te&s;e thereby, wher Gervalx (Croft, the &s;eat of the Clervaux famely) duellith, and that be it the people had a certain conjecture, that there was <HI>&s;pecus &s;ubter</HI> betwixt the ij &endq;places.</Q> The&s;e authorities, (there being more of like nature) will &s;uffice to &s;hew what ideas people formerly had of this place, and &s;erve to introduce the following remarks:&mdash;We ob&s;erved, that in the records of Bi&s;hop Skirlaw, who entered upon this &s;ee in 1389, we find certain lands called <HI>Hell,</HI> which became afterwards the e&s;tate of the Evers; whether the pools took their name from the land, or the land from them, the reader will form his own conjecture. The fir&s;t &s;eems mo&s;t rea&s;onable, on account of the authorities after quoted; and as the mona&s;tic chronicles were not of &s;o ancient date as the event recorded, the &s;cribe would rehear&s;e nothing but &s;uch
<PB N="191" REF="250">traditional tale as then prevailed. Lord Lyttleton ob&s;erves, that the account is of one pit only, whereas there are four, and a long canal which unites two of them, and a third is joined by a &s;hort cut. The complete Hi&s;tory of Durham &s;ays&mdash; <Q>&startq;Such as have more lately con&s;idered them, think them like &s;ome old wrought coalpits, that are downed, but cannot find that ever any coal or other mineral has &endq;been dug thereabouts.</Q>&mdash;It is not probable they were ancient coal-works, for the diameter of one of the large&s;t is not le&s;s than 114 feet, and the lea&s;t 75 feet. The &s;ame authority proceeds&mdash; <Q>II. That they are full of water, and that not hot, &startq;as Mr. Camden was informed, but cold up to the very brim, and keeping much the &s;ame level with the Tees, which runs near them. But as to the nature of the water, the curious differ, &s;ome &s;aying it is derived by &s;ome &s;ubterraneous pa&s;&s;es from the river, &amp;c. but others a&s;&s;ert, that the waters are of a different &endq;kind from the river water, becau&s;e it curdles milk, and will not bear &s;oap.</Q> It is true, the water is cold; but though the pools are near the level of the river, they are never influenced thereby in great floods, which would otherwi&s;e &s;hew a &s;udden ri&s;ing, falling, agitation, or boiling up, if the water of the river was forced thither, up any level, or by virtue of &s;iphonical operations and exhau&s;ted air in &s;ome &s;ub|terraneous tube: the depth of the large&s;t is only 19 feet and a half, the next 17 feet, the next 14, and the lea&s;t 5 feet and a half. Mo&s;t of our lime-works, marle-pits, and allum-pits are wrought much deeper than &s;ix yards; water &s;tanding in hollows, from whence marle has been gotten, will ta&s;te pungent on the tongue, curdle milk and &s;oap: we know of no allum being wrought here, though it abounds in Cleveland, not many miles di&s;tant, but the u&s;e of marle was very early, and it is probable the&s;e were marle-pits; they re&s;emble the workings in other counties, where marling is &s;till practi&s;ed. Marle was known to the Romans, and by them exported hence to foreign countries; we have &s;tatues mentioned by our antiquaries, dedicated to <HI>Nehallennia,</HI> or the <HI>new moon,</HI> particularly &s;ome in&s;cribed by <HI>Negociator Cretarius Britannicianus,</HI> a dealer in <HI>marle, chalk,</HI> or <HI>fuller's earth,</HI> to the Briti&s;h territories: and the&s;e being called <HI>Nehallennia's Kettles,</HI> or of NIE-HEL, in the old German tongue, from the trader's dedication, might be corrupted to or called Hell's Kettles,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Extract of a Letter from Roger Gale, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> to Sir John Clerk.&mdash;Gale's MSS.</HI>

<P>It was remarked before, that Darlington was &s;ituated in an excellent part of the county for a market; every fortnight there is a &s;hew of cattle, and, at the proper &s;ea&s;on, a &s;hew of &s;heep and wool, the mo&s;t abundant of any in the county. Annexed is a table of the average price of long wool for twenty years, the cu&s;tomary &s;tone weight of wool being eighteen pounds, of &s;ixteen ounces to the pound.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">WOOL, 1761, &s;old at 10 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> 9 <ABBR>d.</ABBR> a &s;tone&mdash;1762, at 9 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> 3 <ABBR>d.</ABBR>&mdash;1763, at 12 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> 6 <ABBR>d.</ABBR>&mdash;1764, at 12 <ABBR>s.</ABBR>&mdash;1765, at 12 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> 9 <ABBR>d.</ABBR>&mdash;1766, at 14 <ABBR>s.</ABBR>&mdash;1767, at 12 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> 3 <ABBR>d.</ABBR>&mdash;1768, at 11 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> 9 <ABBR>d.</ABBR>&mdash;1769, at 11 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> 6 <ABBR>d.</ABBR>&mdash;1770, at 10 <ABBR>s.</ABBR>&mdash; 1771, at 10 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> 6 <ABBR>d.</ABBR>&mdash;1772, at 12 <ABBR>s.</ABBR>&mdash;1773, at 11 <ABBR>s.</ABBR>&mdash;1774, at 12 <ABBR>s.</ABBR>&mdash;1775, at 12 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> 6 <ABBR>d.</ABBR>&mdash;1776, at 12 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> 9 <ABBR>d.</ABBR> &mdash;1777, at 13 <ABBR>s.</ABBR>&mdash;1778, at 10 <ABBR>s.</ABBR>&mdash;1779, at 8 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> 3 <ABBR>d.</ABBR>&mdash;1780, at 8 <ABBR>s.</ABBR>&mdash;1781, at 8 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> 6 <ABBR>d.</ABBR>
<P>The author was indebted for the above account, and much information touching the produce of the country, to that excellent farmer, the late Mr. William Charge, of Clea&s;by, who received the golden medal and other premiums from the agricultural &s;ocieties.</P></NOTE> The horned cattle bred on the banks of the Tees, are remarkably beautiful, being of the &s;hort-horned kind, and are fed at four and five years old, in a general way, from eighty to ninety &s;tone weight; &s;ome are much larger; in 1779, a fat ox, bred by Mr. Thomas Hill, of Blackwell, was killed at Darlington, and &s;old by a butcher there for 109 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> 11 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> 6 <ABBR>d.</ABBR> The bea&s;t weighed one hundred and &s;ixty &s;tone ten pounds, at 14 <ABBR>lb.</ABBR> to the &s;tone, of which eleven &s;tone was tallow; he was ri&s;ing &s;ix years old, and mea&s;ured &s;ix feet in &s;tature; was in length nine feet five inches and a half, and over the &s;houlders two feet ten inches broad; he was in girt before the &s;houlders nine feet &s;even inches and a half, behind the &s;houlders ten feet &s;ix inches, and over the loins nine feet &s;ix inches and three quarters.

<P>The manor of EXENHALL is mentioned in Bolden buke, with its &s;ervices, among which is noted the fourth part of a dringage &s;ervice, to plough four acres, and &s;ow them and harrow them, the bi&s;hop finding &s;eed; making ready four portions of land in autumn, three of them with all the men of his manor, and all his own proper family, except the hou&s;ewife, and the fourth, and with one man from each hou&s;e, except his own man&s;ion: to keep dog and hor&s;e for a quarter of a year for the chace, carry the prelate's wine with four oxen, and make <HI>vaware,</HI> a term which appears to be explained by Bi&s;hop Hatfield's Survey by <HI>outward,</HI> which, it is pre&s;umed, related to the chace, and implied an out-watch at the extremities of the chace, it being u&s;ual to make a kind of circumvallation, if the term may be allowed, or circle of watchmen, to prevent the game from e&s;caping the bounds: it is &s;till practi&s;ed in &s;ome of the northern counties, where the lords have a boon-hunt; of which an in&s;tance is in Martindale, in Cumberland, a chace belonging to the Ha&s;ell family. At the time of taking Bi&s;hop Hatfield's Survey, this manor belonged to the Lord Nevill, previous to which, we find, it had conferred a local name on the family re&s;ident there.</P>

In Bolden buke, we find that the villain tenants held 47 oxgangs of land here, under the &s;ame &s;ervices as the villains of Darlington. Among&s;t others, Adam, the &s;on of Ralph de Stapilton, held four oxgangs; was over&s;eer of tho&s;e who prepared the portion land, and &s;erved on the bi&s;hop's emba&s;&s;ies.

Among the lands which he held, is a plot called the <HI>Ca&s;tle-Hill,</HI> with the herbage of Bathley. The ground called Ca&s;tle-Hill is &s;ituated in front of Mr. Hill's hou&s;e; but there is no other tra|dition of a ca&s;tle, nor any remains of a fortification near Blackwell. By this &s;urvey, it appears there were twenty villain tenants here, who were under the &s;ame &s;ervices as tho&s;e at Darlington, only for five additional oxgangs of land they paid x quar|ters of meal, v quarters of barley, and x quarters of oats. There were &s;ix cottagers, and &s;everal tenants on Exchequer lands, which, it is apprehended, were new improvements, and paid full rents to the Exchequer. Wod&s;ilver is mentioned, among the payments made by tenants of the vill, in general. The two great
<PB N="194" REF="254">families of Eure and Nevill had in later times the chief po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions here, Blackwell lands being named among the forfeited e&s;tates of Charles Earl of We&s;tmorland.</P>
<P>COCKERTON lies about a mile to the north-we&s;t of Darlington, in a low &s;itua|tion, and was one of the places given by Styr to St. Cuthbert, along with Darlington. In Bolden buke it is noted, that the villains held forty-&s;even oxgangs of land under the like &s;ervices as tho&s;e of Darlington. In Bi&s;hop Bury's time, Thomas, the &s;on of Jollanus de Morton, held, by the courte&s;y of England, a me&s;&s;uage and four oxgangs of lands there, by homage, fealty, and a certain rent paid to the bi&s;hop's exchequer; he al&s;o held two burgages in Darlington, doing &s;uit at the tollbooth there, and rendering eight pounds of wax for the lights of the church. In Bi&s;hop Hatfield's Survey, we find the &s;ame family of Mortons here, with Gilfrid Kellawe and John Dawe as free-tenants: it appears thereby, that there were nineteen villain tenants; and others, who were at penny ferme,<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Lib.

<P>Of Archdeacon Newton, nothing occurs worth noting.</P>
<P>In the year 1767, a navigable canal was projected, to lead through this part of the county, from Stockton up to Win&s;ton, with various &s;ide cuts, from Darlington to Croftbridge, from Thornton to Pier&s;bridge, and from Cotham Stob to Yarm; the length of the canal was calculated at thirty-three miles, &s;our furlongs, nine chains, and forty-two links: the whole fall in that di&s;tance 328 feet: the expence of the projected work was e&s;timated by Brindley and Whitworth, including the purcha&s;e of lands, at 63,722 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> E&s;timates were made of the carriage of merchandize and the products of the country, which greatly flattered the &s;cheme; but &s;ome influence gave a damp to a project which would have enriched future generations, and given great importance to tho&s;e parts, the produce of which is now, either greatly &s;hut up from foreign markets, or loaded with a burthen of land carriage, which denies its equality with that of other parts of the country.</P>
<P>The following extracts from the tables, exhibited in &s;upport of the propo&s;ed navigation, will &s;hew the importance of this part of the county. Coals won at the coaleries at Etherly, We&s;t Auckland, Cockfield, Norwood, Butterknowle, Bru&s;&s;eltons, Eldon, and Bi&s;hop Auckland, in one year, 101,700 tons.</P>

<HEAD>THE PARISH OF AYCLIFFE.</HEAD>
<P>TO the north of Darlington, lies the pari&s;h of Aycliffe. There are two villages of the name of Aycliffe, viz Great Aycliffe, and School Aycliffe, the latter of which is in the pari&s;h of Heighington; they were part of the ancient po&s;&s;e&s;&s;i|ons of the &s;ee of Lindisfarn, which Simeon &s;ays, were a&s;&s;igned by Bi&s;hop Aldune to the Earls of Northumberland, towards &s;upporting the wars of tho&s;e times, and were not, for &s;everal ages, re&s;tored to the church. Canute, when he perform|ed
<PB N="197" REF="257">his pilgrimage from Garmund&s;way to St. Cuthbert's &s;hrine, by &s;ome writers it is &s;aid, granted Aycliffes to the church, with divers other po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions.

When it was re&s;tored to the &s;ee, or was granted to the priory, doth not appear, without it pa&s;&s;ed as a member, and under the general de&s;cription of Aycliffe; and that &s;eems probable, by the language of the grant from Richard, prior of Durham, to Thomas de Whitworth, (tran&s;cribed into the regi&s;ter book of the pari&s;h church) of the manor of Wood|ham, by metes and bounds: which of the Richards it was, is difficult to a&s;certain: Richard de Claxton was elected in 1273, and re&s;igned in 1285; and Richard de Hoton was elected in 1289, and died in 1308. In Bi&s;hop Bury's time, Alexander de Whitworth died &s;eized of this manor, leaving Thomas, his &s;on and heir.<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Inq. p. m.

The chancel of the church is five paces in length within the altar rails; from whence, de&s;cending by three &s;teps, it is eight paces to the nave; in width five paces, and is &s;talled with oak. The nave, entered by a circular arch, &s;pringing from pila&s;ters, is 16 paces in
<PB N="203" REF="263">length, and 12 in width, having one aile on the &s;outh &s;ide, formed by two octagonal pillars, &s;upporting pointed arches. The church is crowded with heavy galleries to the we&s;t and north.

<P>In the Bolden Buke, it is noted that 16 villains, held each two oxgangs of land in Hieghington, and rendered ten chalders of malt, the like of meal and of oats, and 64 chalders of aver-malt, of the accu&s;tomed mea&s;ure of Heighington-hall; carried eight carriage loads of woodlades, and rendered 32 hens, 1000 eggs, 36 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> for cornage, one milch cow, and one ca&s;tleman. There were two cottagers, each holding 15 acres, for which they wrought two days in every week throughout the year, and joined with the villains in their &s;cats, or exchequer dues, their reaping and yeulwaiting. Three other cottagers held each four acres, and wrought, from St. Peter's day to Martinmas, two days in the week, and the re&s;t of the year, one day in the week. The villains and cottagers dre&s;&s;ed all the growing corn of the vill, and provided each week in autumn for each oxgang of land, one man to reap, and prepared four portions of land, with their whole family, except the hou&s;ewives, when they were intitled to a corrody. Every villain ploughed and harrowed half an acre for oats; and for every carucate of land, they ploughed and harrowed an acre, and had their corrody: and they made one portion, one day, with all the harrows of the town. The &s;ixteen villains rendered 16 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> for michelmet, and 6 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> for yeulwaiting.<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">The payment for the <HI>michelmet,</HI> was for the charges of the Michaelmas court, or mote of the ma|nor. The yeulwaiting, was the watch, or <HI>waits,</HI> as they are &s;till called in the city of Durham, and other parts of the county, who parade the &s;treets with mu&s;ic. Mo&s;t of the ancient church cu&s;toms were derived from the heathens, and this in particular; for when the &s;un approached to its winter period, or &s;ol&s;tice, they devi&s;ed the fable, that Typhon, or the evil &s;pirit of darkne&s;s, was contending with the God of day, and that his legious were di&s;per&s;ed over the earth, to carry mi&s;chiefs to mankind; therefore, to repel their malignity, or drive them from the habitations of man, mu&s;ic was u&s;ed, and &s;ires lighted: after Chri&s;tianity was received, this old cu&s;tom was retained; to plea&s;e tho&s;e, who&s;e minds &s;uper&s;tition and an|cient practices had prejudiced, and the waits or mu&s;ical watch, and yeul-&s;ires, were continued, only ap|plying them to the birth of our Saviour, the Sun of Righteou&s;ne&s;s, in&s;tead of the former ridiculous fable.</NOTE> Simon Ho&s;tion held &s;ixty acres, and rendered a hawk. Thomas Clerk held four oxgangs of land for half a mark, made three portions, and &s;erved on emba&s;&s;ies. Thomas de Penie held other lands. Heighington mill paid 12 marks. The punder had &s;ix acres and his thraves, and rendered four|&s;core hens, and five hundred eggs. The deme&s;ne lands were in farm. All the villains of Hieghington &s;erved in winning and leading the lord's hay, and inclo&s;ed and fenced in the court and the <HI>virgultum:</HI> they al&s;o carried the lord's corn where he ordered, between Tyne and Tees; and each provided one cord at the great cha&s;e, and the bi&s;hop him&s;elf provided, from Heighington-hall, 15 cords. In Bi&s;hop Hatfield's Survey, the free tenants are named with their &s;ervices. Richard Scroope, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> held lands, called the Brakes, containing 100 acres, without rent. The free tenants, and tho&s;e who held tofts, paid 4 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> cornage in September. The &s;ervices of the bond tenants, are thereby &s;tipulated to be &s;imilar to tho&s;e of Killer|by; the &s;ervices &s;pecified, are much the &s;ame as tho&s;e noted in the Bolden Buke. In the valor of the manor, the manor is de&s;cribed to con&s;i&s;t of one manor-hou&s;e,

<P>By the inqui&s;itions po&s;t mortem, we find &s;undry per&s;ons held parcels of land in Heighington in capite, viz.

Cecilia, the widow of John de Evenwood in the eleventh year, John Hunter in the 18th, Thomas de Hexam in the 31&s;t of the &s;ame prelate. William Delwell, in the 1&s;t year of Bi&s;hop Skirlaw, Roger Gelett, in the 5th, and William Delnorth, in the 10th year of that prelate; the latter held by military &s;ervice, &s;uit of court, 2 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> annual rent, 2 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> cornage, 2 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> common aids which &s;hould run in the bi&s;hoprick of Durham, and &s;ervice on the bi&s;hop's em|ba&s;&s;ies when need required.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Inq. p. m. x&deg; Skirlaw.</NOTE> Several of tho&s;e tenements are to be traced into vari|ous de&s;cents, but being &s;mall, are not of &s;ufficient con&s;equence to claim the reader's attention. The po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the family of Scroopes there, appears to be principally a pa&s;ture, containing 22 acres, called Freemenbrekes. It is to be ob&s;erved, the &s;ervile tenures of Heighington were remarkably burthen&s;ome, and the poor wretches who held the lands, were in a va&s;&s;alage, which at this day appears into|lerable to us who enjoy the ble&s;&s;ings of liberty. How much do we owe to the illu&s;trious per&s;onages, who procured that exalted felicity in the la&s;t century, amid&s;t the corruptions of a licentious reign, and the vices of a di&s;&s;ipated age.</P>
<P>In the 43d year of Queen Elizabeth, Elizabeth Jenni&s;on of Walworth, widow of Thomas Jenni&s;on, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> founded a &s;chool here; to the advancement of which, Edward Kirkley, vicar, afterwards gave 70 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> She endowed the &s;chool with an annual &s;tipend of 10 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> part of a rent charge, of 11 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> i&s;&s;uing out of lands in Bi&s;hop Middleham.

The ordinances for their pre&s;ervation, and that they may be publicly known, were directed to be writ|ten in a book, to be kept by the church-wardens of the pari&s;h.</P>

One cottager held his tenement by the &s;ervice of &s;ix days work in autumn. The deme&s;ne lands of Midridge and Thickley, with the improvements, together with the pa&s;tures of Salke&s;down and Redworth, and the &s;heep-&s;tock, were in the bi&s;hop's hands. By Hatfield's Survey, we have little more information of the ancient tenures of this place, than in the preceding record; in the duties of the bond tenants, we &s;ee &s;pecified the <HI>blad. de &s;cat,</HI> or allotted payments in corn, or exchequer corn, to

<P>By the Bolden Buke, it appears there were fifteen villains in Midridge, each of whom held two oxgangs of land, rendering eight chalders of malt, the like of meal and of oats, and &s;ixty chalders of aver-malt, of the hall mea&s;ure, &s;even loads and a half of woodlades, thirty hens, three marks for cornage, one milch-cow, one ca&s;tleman, 15 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> for michelmet, and five &s;hillings yeulwaiting; and they performed their labour like the villains of Heighington. Ulkillus held a cottage, with one oxgang of land, wrought two days in the week throughout the year, and contri|buted with the villains to the <HI>&s;cat.</HI> Three other cottagers held each four acres, and laboured like tho&s;e of Heighington. Verkman and Anketillus held lands on certain &s;ervices. In Bi&s;hop Hatfield's Survey, there are few alterations in the &s;ervices worthy notice. Thomas de Heighington, Adam del Stanes, and Roger Fulthorpe, are named as free tenants. The manor hou&s;e is mentioned, with a lodge for the bailiff, and twenty-one oxgangs of arable land, containing in the whole 305 acres, 113 acres of mowing land, with &s;everal pa&s;ture grounds, the whole yearly value, 28 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> 9 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> 5 <ABBR>d.</ABBR> A piece of wood-land, called Drythop, was claimed by William de Lilburn, who refu&s;ed to permit the bi&s;hop's tenants to depa&s;ture therein.

<P>HIGH WALWORTH, a beautiful &s;eat, the property of John Harri&s;on, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> &s;ituated about a mile di&s;tant from Heighington, of a &s;outhern a&s;pect, and com|manding an exten&s;ive pro&s;pect on the banks of the Tees; having &s;even hundred and two acres of excellent land annexed to it. This was anciently a &s;eat of the Nevills; and whil&s;t they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed &s;uch an exten&s;ive territory as the honours of Barnard Ca&s;tle and Raby, where they exerci&s;ed a &s;pecial juri&s;diction and franchi&s;e, it can be no matter of &s;urpri&s;e, that we &s;o &s;eldom find their e&s;tates in this part of the country, noted in the records of our prelates. Walworth pa&s;&s;ed to Gilbert Han&s;ard, Knight, and his heirs, by marriage of one of the daughters of Ralph Lord Nevill. It continued in that family for &s;everal generations; and at length became the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Ay&s;coughs, of the county of Lincoln, by marriage of the only daughter and heire&s;s of Sir William Han&s;ard, Knight, and from them it came to the Jenni&s;ons, by purcha&s;e; by the branching out of the family of Jenni&s;ons, the original e&s;tate of Walworth was divided, the one part taking the name of High Walworth; the other of Low Walworth; which latter, it is to be ob&s;erved, is one of the regi&s;tered e&s;tates before noted, then the property of John Jenni&s;on, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> and valued at 262 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> a-year. Of this branch, there are de&s;cendants, Augu&s;tine, a monk; Francis, heretofore in the Engli&s;h army an officer of dragoons, now a Count of the holy Roman empire, and chamberlain to his &s;erene highne&s;s the Elector Palatine and Bavaria, and re&s;ides at Heidelberg; and another brother an eccle&s;ia&s;tic. High Walworth, whil&s;t the e&s;tate of Thomas Jenni&s;on, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> who was auditor general to Queen Elizabeth, and was the fir&s;t of that name who re&s;ided there, received great improvements; he erected the man&s;ion hou&s;e from out of a heap of ruins; the &s;outh front is in the high &s;tile of that aera, flanked with circular turrets: the windows decorated with fine painted gla&s;s, exhibiting the arms of many great per&s;onages, his cotemporaries. Ralph Jenni&s;on, who was ma&s;ter of the &s;tag-hounds to the late king, was the la&s;t of that race, who was proprietor of High Walworth; his widow &s;old the e&s;tate about the year 1759, to Matthew Stephen&s;on, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> &s;on of John Stephen&s;on, wine merchant, and Alderman of Newca&s;tle upon Tyne, for 16000 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> who &s;oon afterwards &s;old it to Mr. Harri&s;on, the pre&s;ent owner.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Bi&s;hop Sinews granted Walworth to Richard Bella&s;is, in the minority of Elizabeth, daughter and heire&s;s of William Han&s;ard, &s;on and heir of Sir William Han&s;ard. <HI>Cur&s;it.

<P>In the 2d of Bi&s;hop Barnes, a pardon was obtained for the alienation of Walworth, by William A&s;kew, and Ann his wife. to Thomas Jenni&s;on, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> 20th Sept. Ao. 2d ep. <HI>Ibid MSS.</HI></P>
<P N="31">31&s;t James I. 1615, a &s;ettlement was made of the manor of Walworth, to the u&s;e of Rob.

<P>The author received the following account of the Jenni&s;ons, from Francis before named, who now &s;ub&s;cribes him&s;elf Jenni&s;on Walworth, dated Heidelberg, in Germany, 20th Nov. 1792. Thomas Jenni&s;on, who lived in the reign of Queen Elizabeth, was al&s;o lord of the manor of Carlbury and Woodham This gentleman inherited drom his ance&s;tor Thomas Jenni&s;on, who lived in the time of King Henry VI Yokeflect, Guen$ke, and Bennetland, in the county of York, Winterton, in Lincoln&s;hire, Burnham We&s;tgate, Burnham Norton, Burnham Ulp, Burnham St. Andrew, Burnham St Edmund, and Depedale, in the county of Norfolk, as appears from the records of the Herald's Office, and the family deeds. Thomas &s;ettled at Walworth, and by his wife, Elizabeth, daughter of Sir Edward Birch, of Sandon, in the county of Bedford, left many children, from whom de&s;cended &s;everal of that name; viz Sir Matthew Jenni&s;on, of Newark upon Trent; Sir Ralph, of El&s;wick, in Northumberland; but none of tho&s;e branches left i&s;&s;ue. Walworth remained in the family undevi&s;ed, till the time of John Jenni&s;on, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> who died 2d March, 1680. He married to his fir&s;t wife, Catharine, daughter of William Ironmonger, of Eccleshall, in Stafford&s;hire, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> by whom he had i&s;&s;ue Robert, Thomas, and Catharine, who all died unmarried. His &s;econd wife was Elizabeth, daughter of Thomas Pier&s;on, of Newca&s;tle upon Tyne, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> and by her he had Jo&s;eph, who died an infant, John, who &s;ucceeded to a part of Walworth, and &s;everal other children. After their father, Robert, the elde&s;t &s;on, claimed the whole of the e&s;tate; by a decree in Chancery, it was divided; Robert had High Walworth, with the man&s;ion hou&s;e, and John had Low Walworth, with the jointer hou&s;e built for his mother. Ralph Jenni&s;on, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> a lineal de&s;cendant, obtained power to &s;ell for payment of debts, by an act of parliament; by virtue of which, the e&s;tate of High Walworth was &s;old as before mentioned.&mdash;Francis before mentioned, the de&s;cendant of John, &s;old Low Walworth, and went to the continent.</P></NOTE></P>

<P>KILLERBY, a detached member of this pari&s;h, lies to the we&s;t, a village in a low &s;ituation. By the Bolden Buke, it appears there were anciently twelve villains, each of whom held two oxgangs of land, and that they rendered eight chalders and a half of malt, the like of meal and of oats, and forty-eight chalders of aver-malt, of the mea&s;ure of Heighington-Hall; they made &s;ix loads of woodlades, rendered twenty-four hens, 36 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> 6 <ABBR>d.</ABBR> for cornage, one milch-cow, one ca&s;tleman, 12 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> for michelmet, and 4 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> for yeulwaiting; and performed equal work with tho&s;e of Heighington. Two cottagers wrought &s;ix days in autumn, and Simon Ho&s;tiarius held a carucate of free land, by the twelfth part of a knight's fee. In Bi&s;hop Hatfield's Survey, it is &s;et forth, that John Killerby held Simon's lands, being &s;ixty-one acres, and there were two other free tenants. The &s;ervices of the bond tenants and cottagers are more di&s;tinctly &s;pecified and &s;et forth, together with the occa&s;ions which intitled them to the corrody; they were obliged to carry for the bi&s;hop, three loads between Tyne and Tees, and as often as his plea&s;ure was, to carry between Tees and Were; and each tenant was to provide one cord at the bi&s;hop's great chace.</P>

<HEAD>THE PARISH OF GAINFORD.</HEAD>
<P>WE entered this pari&s;h at PIERSBRIDGE, a village on the banks of the river Tees, over which is a &s;tone bridge of three arches. The village &s;tands on the margin of a rich vale, and on the &s;ite of a Roman &s;tation; the remains of the north and we&s;t &s;ides of the vallum, and part of the &s;outh line, are very con&s;picu|ous; the hou&s;es are built a little way within the mound, and in the &s;ame direction. The Roman road pa&s;&s;ed a few paces to the ea&s;t of the &s;tation, extending in a line with the pre&s;ent way from Leg&s;cro&s;s, towards Cathrick: an ancient bridge over the river lay in this direction; the timbers, piles, or framings of the foundation were vi&s;ible till the great flood in November, 1771, when they were torn up and wa&s;hed away: the pre&s;ent &s;tone bridge now &s;tands 260 paces higher up the river. Mr. Hor&s;ley,<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Brit. Rom. p. 486.</NOTE> &s;peaking of Pier&s;bridge, &s;ays&mdash; <Q>This place has been a con&s;iderable &startq;Roman &s;tation.

<P>Dr. HUNTER'S NOTES, MSS.</P></NOTE> and the foundations of hou&s;es every where appear, e&s;pecially when the earth is any where opened, or even well watered with rain, and after a &s;hower, the coins are al&s;o di&s;covered, and gathered up in abundance. A large &s;tone coffin was al&s;o found here, and other antiquities. The la&s;t time I viewed the place, I was inclined to think, that a &s;ort of garden, with &s;ome trees in it, which I once imagined might be inclo&s;ed in part with &s;ome of the ramparts of the &s;tation, has rather been the Praetorium only. This &s;tation and town are on the north &s;ide of the Tees, but there is another rivulet on the north &s;ide of the &s;tation, &s;o that it has had the u&s;ual &s;ituation on a lingula between a greater and a &s;maller river, and near their confluence; yet there is high ground both to
<PB N="215" REF="275">the north and &s;outh of the &s;tation. As I went from Durham to Pier&s;bridge, I &s;aw two &s;eeming tumuli, one a mile from the town on the left, the other near the &endq;entrance to the town, on the right.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;The military way from Binche&s;ter to this place is very vi&s;ible, e&s;pecially near Pier&s;bridge, my landlord called it the broad-way, he al&s;o told me of a bridge, &s;ome of the wood of which was yet remaining; there was an elevation very vi&s;ible beyond this bridge, (which was over the rivulet) but I took this to be rather the continuance of the military way, than any part of the ramparts of the &s;tation. The way points directly to the tofts, the field in which the &s;tation has probably been, and from whence the coins have the name of toft-pieces. The hou&s;es which &s;tand here are called the Bury, or Carle-bury, perhaps it has been Ca&s;tle-bury: I therefore take Pier&s;bridge to be Magae in the Notitia. Dr. Gale &s;uppo&s;es this to be the &s;ame with Magna in the Itinerary, which he places at Old Radnor; but &endq;this is va&s;tly too far to the &s;outh, if we ob&s;erve the order in the Notitia.</Q> <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">In the Latin Edition of Camden, 1594, this place is not noted.
<P>Brit. Rom. p. 296. <HI>Dis manibus. Condati Antonius Quintianus&mdash;ex ju&s;&s;u &s;u&s;ceptum &s;olvit libenti animo.</HI></P>
<P>This &s;tone was found near Pier&s;bridge, not far from Wathing-&s;treet; it has been publi&s;hed by Mr. Thore&s;by; as al&s;o in the la&s;t editions of Camden, and is in&s;erted by Dr. Gale in his Antonini Itinerarium. It is a funeral monument erected to one Condatus, in the u&s;ual tenor of &s;uch in&s;criptions; I wonder, therefore, that not only Mr. Thore&s;by, but al&s;o the learned and judicious Dr. Gale, &s;hould take it for the name of a place, which does not u&s;e to be in&s;erted in this kind of in&s;criptions, and that they &s;hould &s;u&s;pect it to be the Condate in the Itinerary, which by all circum&s;tances, appears to be in Che&s;hire. As <HI>Condatus</HI> is the name of the decea&s;ed, &s;o Antonius Quintianus are two names of the per&s;on who erected the altar, and I &s;uppo&s;e MEN to be a third name of the &s;ame per&s;on. The line in the ba&s;e, I have ventured to read <HI>ex ju&s;&s;u &s;u&s;ceptum &s;olvit libenti animo,</HI> becau&s;e it was common for them to pretend, that they took a vow upon them by the command or order of &s;ome deity. Parallel in&s;tances of this kind may be &s;een in many collections. Mr. Ward reads the letters, <HI>Ex. cc. imp. Ex chari&s;&s;ima conjugis impen&s;a,</HI> and &s;o refers <HI>ex ju&s;&s;u &s;u&s;ceptum</HI> on the ba&s;e, to the order of the widow, who not being pre&s;ent, de&s;ired this Quintianus, a friend or relation of her decea&s;ed hu&s;band, to erect this monument at her expence. In Manutius C C. &s;tands for <HI>chari&s;&s;ima conjux,</HI> but if any think them put for <HI>contubernalium</HI> here, the &s;en&s;e will not be incongruous. Kennet has <HI>contubernales imperatoris,</HI> but he produces no authority for it, and I think it is without probability. It was not uncommon for them to erect &s;epulchral monuments and altars, near a river, and a military way, though it might not be very near to a &s;tation; &s;o that it is not nece&s;&s;ary, barely upon this account, to &s;uppo&s;e there has been a &s;tation, either at or near the place where this altar was found, for other evidences put it out of doubt that there was, as is &s;hewn above.</P></NOTE> Dr. Gib&s;on &s;uppo&s;es this place to have been originally called Prie&s;tbridge, either from two neigbouring prie&s;ts, who built a bridge of &s;tone over the river here, in&s;tead of a wooden bridge which they found there; or from &s;ome prie&s;ts who were appointed to officiate in a chapel, the ruins of which are &s;till to be &s;een near the bridge. In Leland's Itinerary, vol. I. p. 74, this place is noted&mdash; <Q>Per&s;ebridge, &startq;&s;umtime of five arches, but a late made new of three arches. There is a prati chapel of our lady, hard by Per&s;ebridge, of the foundation of John Balliol, King &endq;of Scottes.</Q> This chapel, of which there are &s;ome remains, was called St. Mary's, but we know little further concerning it;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Copied by Dr. Hunter from an old MS. wrote &s;ince the di&s;&s;olution, but without a date.</HI>

Twenty-two years ago, a &s;tranger from York, demanded the money upon the inhabitants, when, particularly George Hob&s;on, de&s;iring to know by what authority he a&s;ked it, he refu&s;ed to &s;hew any, but threatened them with an exchequer writ; they, frightened at this, were forced to comply.</P>

<P>The foregoing conjectures, as to the etymology of the name of this place, are left to the reader; to which we may add, that it might derive its name from a bridge erected on Piers, or that it was called Prie&s;t-bridge, at once, from its being the approach to this eccle&s;ia&s;tical territory, and the place e&s;tabli&s;hed by ancient cu&s;tom for the holders of Sockburn manor to deliver a faulchion to the Bi&s;hop of Durham, on his fir&s;t coming into his Palatinate. Mr. Hor&s;ley confounds the names of Carlebury and Pier&s;bridge, as if appertaining to the &s;ame ground; whereas Carlebury lies on the other &s;ide of the brook: Carle is a word of northern acceptation, and probably the tumulus mentioned above gave name to the ground, as being the place of interment of &s;ome carle or chieftan. Be&s;ides the remains noted by Mr. Hor&s;ley, a multitude of coins of the Lower Empire have been found here, of which many are in Mr. Allan's collection, together with a &s;mall and elegant bra&s;s bu&s;to.<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">In the la&s;t volume of the Archaeologia, is engraven a &s;mall bra&s;s figure of Mercury, communicated by Mr. Cade, &s;aid to be found here.</NOTE> In the year 1749, a fragment of a Roman in&s;cription was dug up at Carlebury, tran&s;cribed by Dr. Hunter, but &s;o mutilated as to afford no reading.</P>

<P>The CHAPELRY of DENTON lies to the north-ea&s;t of Pier&s;bridge, and compre|hends the town&s;hips of Denton and Haughton-le-Side. Denton and Haughton are members of the honour of Ca&s;tle Barnard. Denton is &s;ituated in a valley, watered by a &s;mall brook which runs through it.&mdash;Tho&s;e who have &s;ought after di&s;tant etymologies, have conceived this was once a &s;ettlement of the Danes, from whom it derived its name; but perhaps it was &s;o called from the dean or valley in which it &s;tands. This was once a con&s;iderable town, as the remains and ve&s;tigia of hou&s;es denote, but it is now reduced to a &s;mall village. There is a tradition, that Denton, Ulmaby, Carlebury, Walworth, Haughton-le-Side, Shackerton, New|biggin, and other villages in this di&s;trict, were burned on an incur&s;ion of the Scots; and it is probable Malcolm took his route down this track, when he came by Hunderthwaite, and penetrated as far as Cleveland. William the Norman laid wa&s;te the country between York and Durham; but, it is pre&s;umed, he only marked the progre&s;s of his army by tho&s;e deva&s;tations, and did not &s;pread de&s;truction over all the adjacent lands: the ford at Ne&s;ham was then the u&s;ual &s;ummer pa&s;&s;age out of York&s;hire into the palatinate.</P>

<P>The vale in which Pier&s;bridge &s;tands, produces the fine&s;t barley. There are great lime-works at Carlebury, which &s;upply a large tract of country. The pro&s;pects on the road as the traveller advances to Gainford, are narrow, but various and beautiful; the York&s;hire banks of the river ri&s;e more lofty than tho&s;e on the Durham &s;ide, but both con&s;i&s;t of grounds highly cultivated. Oppo&s;ite to Pier&s;-bridge, on the York&s;hire &s;ide, covered with a thick grove, &s;tands Cliff, the &s;eat of the Withams, taking its name from the &s;ituation. On the Durham &s;ide, a little further we&s;t, on a fine declivity, and within an agreeable di&s;tance of the river, is Snow-hall, formerly the e&s;tate of the Rains, now of Doctor Sherwood. To the north of the turnpike road, &s;tands Gray&s;ton-hall, detached of late years from the Snow-hall e&s;tate, and now the property of the Elliots. Advancing a little further, a view opens upon the village of Gainford, &s;eated in a mo&s;t delightful valley, through which the river winds beautifully. There are &s;teep and broken cliffs on the York&s;hire &s;ide, &s;kirted and crowned with &s;cattered groves. The oppo&s;ite lands con&s;i&s;t of fine meadows, hanging with an ea&s;y declivity towards the river. The village, which contains many hand&s;ome hou&s;es, forms a &s;quare, with a green in the centre:<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Here lived in the decline of life, and died, that great arti&s;t, Mr. William Stephens: one of the fir&s;t engravers of the age, for imitating records and ancient in&s;criptions.</NOTE> the vicarage hou&s;e &s;tands on the &s;outh &s;ide, with excellent gardens hanging on the brink of the river. Compari&s;on is frequently made between Gainford and Hurworth, as to the beauty of their &s;ituations; but they are wholly di&s;&s;imilar, the one being on an elevated brow, and the other in a &s;eque&s;tered vale.</P>
<P>Gainford is of great antiquity: the fir&s;t church was built by Egred, otherwi&s;e called Egfrid, Bi&s;hop of Lindisfarn, and given by him to the &s;ee, with the vills of

Gainford became the e&s;tate of the Baliols, by Hugh's marrying Agnes de Valencia, and being part of the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of John Baliol, was included in the forfeitures of that unfortunate prince. Under that event, large po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions devolved on the &s;ee of Durham, but the king having enter|tained a great di&s;plea&s;ure at Bi&s;hop Beck, &s;eized Gainford, and gave it to Guido de Bello Campo, Earl of Warwick, to hold in capite of the crown. It was then a member of the honour of Ca&s;tle Barnard, which pa&s;&s;ed by the &s;ame forfeiture, and was included in the &s;ame grant. King Edward II. did not rever&s;e the grant, or make re&s;titution to the church; and it was not till the time of-Bi&s;hop Lewis Beaumont, in the 1 &s;t year of King Edward III. that the forfeited e&s;tates were yielded to the &s;ee after judgment obtained in parliament.<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Vide vol. i.</NOTE> By the proce&s;s it is &s;tated, that the Earl of Warwick was then dead.

The records do not note, that the Nevills held more in Bolam, than before &s;pecified; neither is it &s;hewn to whom the great pro|perty of de la Pole de&s;cended in after ages. The public records of this part of the county, are very imperfect; there having been frequent di&s;putes, touching the exerci&s;e of juri&s;diction, in the liberty of Ca&s;tle Barnard, as a member of the wa|pentake of Sadberg, and of the &s;heriffdom of that di&s;trict. In the 3d year of Queen Elizabeth, by authority of her letters patent, one Pur&s;eglove, a prie&s;t,
<PB N="225" REF="285">founded a &s;chool and ho&s;pital at Gui&s;burn in York&s;hire, and endowed it with his lands, tenements, rents, and &s;ervices at Bolam. By a late divi&s;ion of the common fields there, this charity has received a great augmentation, and the country much improvement.<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">By let. pat. dated 5th June, in the 3d year of the reign of Queen Elizabeth, Robert Pur&s;eglove was impowered to found this &s;chool and ho&s;pital, and thereby the guardians thereof were authorized to take lands, not exceeding 60 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> a year, to whom &s;hould belong a common &s;eal: in pur&s;uance of which, he made a foundation deed, dated 11th of Augu&s;t following.

<P>MORTON TYNEMOUTH, a &s;mall village, has nothing remarkable; we di&s;cover no cau&s;e for the name of Tynemouth, there being no reference, in any records, to the mona&s;tery of Tynemouth, or any mines in the adjacent grounds, where tin could be wrought. In the time of Bi&s;hop Skirlaw, Agnes, the wife of Patric de Morton, died &s;eized of divers lands there; and in the inqui&s;ition, the place is called Tylmouth, a name as difficult in its etymology as the former. This was one of the villages re&s;igned to the Earls of Northumberland, and never re&s;tored to the &s;ee. Bi&s;hop Dudley granted licence to the convent of Durham to purcha&s;e lands here.</P>
<P>The pari&s;h of Win&s;ton intervenes between Gain&s;ord, and the chapelries of Whorleton and Barnard Ca&s;tle: which pari&s;h, it is thought expedient to attend to in this place, in order to prevent a disjunction of &s;everal important &s;ubjects, which would nece&s;&s;arily happen, by reverting to Win&s;ton, after treating of Barnard Ca&s;tle.</P>

<HEAD>THE PARISH OF WINSTON.</HEAD>
<P>WINSTON is a manor belonging to the Duke of Bridgewater. The village is meanly built, on the ridge of a hill, clo&s;e upon the river Tees. This was for|merly the e&s;tate of the Scroops of Ma&s;ham, and being forfeited by Henry Scroop, for trea&s;on again&s;t King Henry V. came to the &s;ee of Durham. By the inqui&s;ition, it is found that Henry was &s;eized in fee, which would have grounded a forfeiture to the bi&s;hop; but by indenture, dated<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Cur&s;itor's Rolls.&mdash;Rudd's MSS.</NOTE> at Raby, <HI>in fe&s;to &s;c'i Hill. anno regni R' Edw. &s;ilij regis Edw.</HI> 7&deg;. it appeared that he had only an e&s;tate tail, under the grant of Ralph de Nevill to Galfrid le Scroop, being the i&s;&s;ue under that intail; and John being brother and heir, was intitled in remainder; till the 26th King Henry VIII. there was not any forfeiture of an e&s;tate tail, &s;o that the bi&s;hop had not, in fact, any right to the forfeiture, &s;urther, than of the life e&s;tate of the party. This coming to be inquired of, in the time of Bi&s;hop Nevill, he re&s;tored the manor by his charter, dated 15th April, in the 14th year of his epi&s;copacy, to John the bro|ther and heir of Henry, <HI>Hen'd. de dono uro,</HI> with a &s;aving of the profits which had been an&s;wered by the e&s;cheator, in his account to the exchequer: the intail was never pleaded, or any judgment obtained for an <HI>amoveas manus,</HI> or any account demanded of the profits.

<P>The church of Win&s;ton &s;tands on an elevated ground, at the ea&s;t end of the village; the whole edifice is about twelve paces in length, and eight in width, lighted to the ea&s;t by three narrow windows, and to the &s;outh by three windows, and a &s;mall additional one: the chancel is divided from the nave by a circular arch; there is an aile to the &s;outh, formed by a round column and a broad one, &s;upporting circular arches: it is decently &s;talled, and kept clean. The rectory-hou&s;e &s;tands on the brink of the banks, with hanging gardens in terraces; the land&s;cape viewed from the windows is beautiful; the river flows in ea&s;y &s;treams at the foot of the gardens, for a mile in length, cro&s;&s;ed by the bridge de&s;cribed in the notes,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The bridge was built in 1764, for the accommodation of the country in the carriage of coals and lime from the county of Durham into York&s;hire, a large tract being &s;upplied by means of that pa&s;&s;age. The plan of the bridge was projected by the late Sir Thomas Robin&s;on, the arch being the &s;egment of a circle, who&s;e &s;pan is one hundred and eleven feet, and the breadth at the top twenty feet. The eleva|tion is &s;uch as to render the road level with the lands on the York&s;hire &s;hore: it is built of blui&s;h rag|&s;tone, of a hard, heavy, and durable nature.

The chapel &s;tands on the &s;outh of the village, and from the adjacent ground, the pro&s;pects over the York&s;hire &s;hore are excellent. To the &s;outh, you have a view of Wycliffe hou&s;e, a new erected man&s;ion, on an elegant plan, lately the &s;eat of Marmaduke Tun&s;tall, decea&s;ed, now of Francis Sheldon, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> his nephew, the retirement of the mu&s;es, the &s;ciences, and polite literature; in front, you look upon Thorp, the man&s;ion of the late family of Wilkin&s;ons, now become the pro|perty of Sheldon Cradock, of Hartford, in the county of York, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> in right of his lady: nearer to the water, in the depth of the vale, lies the church and rectory-hou&s;e of Wycliffe, and to the we&s;t you command a pro&s;pect of Morton-Hall, the ancient place of the Rookbies, together with Rokeby Park, the elegant &s;eat of John Bacon Sawrey Morritt, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> The grounds around the&s;e &s;everal places are in the highe&s;t &s;tate of cultivation, graced with &s;ine plantations, and other orna|mental works; the river's banks are rocky and &s;teep, fringed with hanging woods, or crowned with noble fore&s;t trees; the river falls in ca&s;cades ha&s;ty and &s;onorous; and the whole &s;cene is more adapted to the de&s;criptive powers of the pencil than of the pen. On the back terrace, adjoining to Wycliffe hou&s;e, are two excellent views for the painter; one to the ea&s;t, wild and augu&s;t, abounding in rocks, hanging woods, and water; the other to the we&s;t in a tamer nature, commanding the vale through which the river flows, having Wycliffe church in front, inclo&s;ed on one hand by wooded banks, and fringed rocks, which overhang the &s;tream; on the other by a rich cultivated &s;cene, inclining gently towards the river: neither of the land&s;capes are too exten&s;ive to have due and dictinct expre&s;&s;ion of objects by the painter.</P>

<P>THE town of CASTLE BARNARD is &s;ituated on the &s;outhern inclination of a hill, de&s;cending &s;wiftly to the river Tees.

The town is a mile in length: the markets occupy a flat, where the buildings are modern and hand&s;ome, and the &s;treet is upwards of forty yards in width; the Hor&s;e-market, the Great-market, and Thorngate, run, nearly in a parallel line. On the &s;ummit of a high rock to the we&s;tward of the town, &s;tand the remains of the ancient ca&s;tle, which gave name to the place. The air of this part of the county is remarkably &s;alubrious, the market is cheap and abundant, coals are plentiful within the di&s;tance of eight miles: the town &s;tands in a fine &s;porting country, and the &s;ituation po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es every advantage, to render a rural and retired life plea&s;ant. The woollen manufactory, for which the place was happily &s;ituated, was &s;ome years ago in a very flouri&s;hing &s;tate, though now declining, from the great ri&s;e of cotton goods; much bu&s;ine&s;s is done by the tanners, and the &s;tocking trade is particularly flouri&s;hing.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Journals, Hou&s;e of Commons, 12th vol.</HI> 465, <HI>31&s;t January, 10th William III.

<P>From what has been &s;et forth, it is to be ob&s;erved, that in the &s;pace of &s;eventy years, this territory was granted out from the crown, the borough was con&s;tituted, and the ca&s;tle erected, and had de&s;cended to the grand&s;on of Gui. Barnard's charter &s;hews he was not the original patron of this place, for though his deed has the language of a primary grant; yet, by reference to his father's act, it has only the operation of a confirmatory one; and we are &s;o unfortunate as not to po&s;&s;e&s;s the original charter, or any minutes of it, further than the above evidence, and what is mentioned in the &s;equel. The in&s;trument before us, is a grant and confir|mation of privileges to the burgagers of Ca&s;tle Barnard, and their heirs; which language of inheritance, is &s;trictly applicable to a burgage tenure, and not ap|plicable, in any manner, to a mere per&s;onal right: they are therein called liberties and free cu&s;toms, and were to be holden of the grantor and his heirs in chief, in fee, and inheritance, &s;imilar to the liberties of Richmond. This reference leaves us in the dark, to what particulars the grant extended. The words <HI>quas dedit eis pater meus et conce&s;&s;it,</HI> though occurring in the habendum, carry no implication, that he granted any thing to Richmond. The words <HI>eis,</HI> grammatically referring to the burgagers of Ca&s;tle Barnard; nor do we know that the Baliols had any intere&s;t in Richmond.

<P>In this in&s;trument we find a &s;econd race of grantees, for he not only makes his charter to his burgagers, but al&s;o to the freeholders of the town, <Q>of a certain
<PB N="237" REF="297">&startq;common pa&s;ture in Marwood, by the boundaries therein &s;et forth, to wit, from a cro&s;s, called Roger Cro&s;s, by the wall up to the Saltury or Deer's Leap, under Stanley, on the we&s;t; and from thence to Egle&s;ton way, adjoining to Beacon|&s;tone gate, on the north; and &s;o by Egle&s;ton way to the we&s;t foot of Ea&s;t-mo&s;s-mire bridge, and &s;o in Blackdean towards the north; <HI>in exchange for lands which he had inclo&s;ed in his park; and others which</HI> the burgagers had relea&s;ed to him and his heirs. To hold the pa&s;ture &s;o granted to the burgagers, and free|holders <HI>and their heirs,</HI> of the grantor, <HI>and his heirs in fee and inheritance,</HI> as they &endq;held their other common pa&s;ture.</Q> But it was therein excepted, that the grantees &s;hould not take any wood, green or dry, within the limits, or dig in the turbary, or in the moor. The word Flatcht u&s;ed in this place, is derived from the word <HI>flache</HI> in the old French; and &s;ignifies, in this record, that no pits or holes &s;hould be dug. In the preceeding grant, all the common land, from Beck|dam and Stanhope, or Stainton way, was granted, being the ea&s;t and north ea&s;t portion of the wa&s;tes: by the la&s;t grant we have the we&s;tern portion of the com|mon lands conveyed, and for that purpo&s;e it was nece&s;&s;ary, only to di&s;tingui&s;h the out&s;ide boundary, and not to repeat the boundaries (Stanhope way and Beckdam) of the lands before granted; which were noted in the former in&s;trument, for the purpo&s;e of di&s;tingui&s;hing, with per&s;picuity, the granted from the ungranted lands; the de&s;cription in the la&s;t grant cea&s;es at that point, and doth not circumvallate (if we may u&s;e the expre&s;&s;ion) the ground compri&s;ed in the former deed; for the other boundaries were notorious, and the ancients hated a multiplicity of words in their in&s;truments. It is to be ob&s;erved in the la&s;t in&s;trument, lands called a common pa&s;ture, are granted in fee and inheritance to two &s;ets of &s;ubjects, capable of inheriting, to wit, tho&s;e holding burgage tenements and freeholders; and no &s;eparate per&s;onal right, is thereby created. By the&s;e two charters, were granted to the proprietors of lands and tenements in Barnard Ca&s;tle, a wide tract of coun|try, the ea&s;tern boundary comprehends near 9000 acres of excellent ground, the we&s;tern boundary, 700 acres of land, capable of high cultivation. John Baliol, then Lord of Ca&s;tle Barnard, about the 14th year of King Henry III. founded an ho&s;pital there, which was dedicated to St. John the Bapti&s;t, which he endowed with lands; but the endowment, and every evidence of the original &s;tate of this foundation are lo&s;t, &s;o that no more can be related of it, than what appears in modern in&s;truments: the nomination of cu&s;tos or ma&s;ter, has for many years pa&s;t, remained in the lord chancellor and the ma&s;ter, in right of his office, receives a &s;mall yearly re&s;erved rent from the lands, which are let out on a lea&s;e for three lives, renewable on payment of a moderate fine, much after the rate of the Lord Bi&s;hop of Durham's renewal fines. Three women are received into the hou&s;e, who have 3 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> 4 <ABBR>d.</ABBR> a month, and 25 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> every other year for gowns.

On the forfeiture of John Baliol, Bi&s;hop Beck claimed his e&s;tates, as of the jura regalia of his palatinate, which is par|ticularly mentioned in the annals of that prelate: the king, &s;tudious of humbling the proud Beck, and willing to abridge the over-grown power of a &s;ubject, in who&s;e province was &s;uch a di&s;tingui&s;hed franchi&s;e, &s;eized the palatinate; the re|&s;titution thereof was not long of being obtained, but it came back to the prelate mutilated and abridged of tho&s;e noble acqui&s;itions it had &s;o lately gained, by the forfeitures of Baliol and Brus.

<P>In the Egle&s;ton manu&s;cript, before noted, it is &s;aid, that Barnard Ca&s;tle, on the death of Richard, <Q>came to Henry VII. and &s;o hath continued in the crown ever &startq;&s;ince, as appeareth by &s;everal records and accounts, made by the con&s;tables of the ca&s;tle and the bailiffe of that libertie, till it came to the Earl of We&s;tmor|land &endq;by marriage, and by him was forfeited 12th Elizabeth:</Q> this account wants much elucidation. In 1471, Richard Nevill, Earl of Warwick, was &s;lain at the
<PB N="244" REF="307">battle of Barnet. His lady Anna, by the death of Henry her brother, without &s;urviving i&s;&s;ue, became po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of his great inheritances, being his only &s;i&s;ter of the full blood: after the death of Earl Richard, his lady's po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, among&s;t which Barnard Ca&s;tle was a part, were, by authority of parliament, taken from her, and &s;ettled on I&s;abel and Ann, her two daughters and heirs, the wives of the Dukes of Clarence and Glouce&s;ter, as if &s;he had been naturally dead; and the &s;ame were with-held from her, till the third year of Henry VII. 1488, when the king, having a mind for Barnard Ca&s;tle, the daughters being then dead, by a new act, annulled the former &s;ettlement, and re&s;tored her to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the ca&s;tle and manor, with power to alienate them; and the &s;ame year, on the 13th of December, by a &s;pecial feofment and &s;ine, &s;he conveyd them wholly to the king, intailing it on the i&s;&s;ue male of his body, with remainder to her&s;elf and her heirs.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dugdale, 307.</NOTE> The preceding manu&s;cript &s;ays, Barnard Ca&s;tle came to the Earl of We&s;tmorland by marriage. How this happened, we are left to conjecture only: if it was derived in that manner, it probably came by intermarriage with the Buckingham family; Ralph, the third &s;on of Humphrey, fir&s;t Duke of Buckingham, married Margaret Counte&s;s of Richmond,<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Vincent, p. 87.</NOTE> mother to King Henry VII. and Ralph Nevill, Earl of We&s;tmorland, married Catharine, daughter of Edward, la&s;t Duke of Buckingham of the Stafford line. Be that as it may, it is certain this ca&s;tle and manor, after pa&s;&s;ing through the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of &s;undry per&s;ons, were the e&s;tate of Charles, Earl of We&s;tmorland, at the time of his attainder, in the 13th year of Queen Elizabeth. The Bi&s;hop claimed the Earl's large e&s;tates, in forfeiture, but the parliament in|terfered, and gave them to the crown, under pretence of making re&s;titution for the expences &s;u&s;tained on that occa&s;ion, and particularly for her protection and care of the bi&s;hoprick. Sir George Bowes, of Streatlam; on the rumour of that defection of the Nevills, &s;eized Barnard Ca&s;tle, and filled it with troops; he de|fended him&s;elf there again&s;t the rebel forces, until the Queen's army approached, previous to the affair of Bramham Moor. This manor and ca&s;tle were granted by King James I. to Robert, Vi&s;count Bran&s;path, and Earl of Somer&s;et, and re|verted to the crown on his attainder. During the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the crown, various in&s;truments were made, and now of record, relative to the forfeited e&s;tates, which it will be nece&s;&s;ary to attend to. Queen Elizabeth cau&s;ed an inqui&s;ition to be taken thereof; which now remains in the king's exchequer; but as it only exhibits a mere rental of the lands, nothing occurs therein worthy a place here. In the eleventh year of the Queen's reign, &s;he demi&s;ed the deme&s;ne lands of Barnard Ca&s;tle, with &s;ome mines, to George Bowes for 21 years, and on the death of George, in the year 1581, &s;he accepted a &s;urrender of the lea&s;e, and for a &s;ine renewed the demi&s;e for 21 years from that date: what appears &s;ingular in this record, and ir|reconcilable is, the Earl of We&s;tmorland was not attainted till after the 11th year of the Queen. The e&s;tates continuing in the crown, during the reign of Queen Elizabeth, and pa&s;&s;ing to King James I. he cau&s;ed an inqui&s;ition to be taken there|of, which, in the 12th year of his reign, 1616, was returned into his exchequer, where it remains of record.

<P>The remains of the ca&s;tle cover about &s;ix acres and three quarters of ground; the parts of chief &s;trength &s;tand on the brink of a &s;teep rock, about eighty perpen|dicular feet above the river, on the north-we&s;t corner of the principal area, commanding a mo&s;t beautiful pro&s;pect up the river. It is not po&s;&s;ible to form any competent idea, by the pre&s;ent ruins, what this fortre&s;s was, in its original &s;tate, or greate&s;t &s;trength: it was inclo&s;ed from the town by a &s;trong and high wall, with one gateway from the pre&s;ent market-place, and another to the north from the Flatts. The area entered by the market-place gate doth not appear to have had any communication with the chief &s;trongholds and bulwarks of the place, but probably contained the chapel after mentioned: it is &s;eparated from the interior buildings by a deep fo&s;&s;e, which &s;urrounds the re&s;t of the fortre&s;s. This area is fenced with a high wall along the edge of the rocks behind Briggate, or Bridgegate &s;treet. In all this length of wall, there appears no cantonment, ba&s;tion, or turret: if ever it had embrazures, they are now totally gone. To the north, the wall has a more ancient and fortified appearance. The gateway to the Flats opens from a large area to the Roman road, which, on the one hand, com|municated with the ford, that gave name to the village on the York&s;hire banks of the river, called Street-ford, now corrupted to Stratford; and on the other hand led towards Street-le-ham and Staindrop. This area, together with that before de&s;cribed, were anciently u&s;ed to receive the cattle of the adjacent country, in times of inva&s;ion and public danger. The gateway la&s;t mentioned is defended by one half-round tower, or demi-ba&s;tion, and the broken walls &s;hew &s;ome appearances of ma&s;kings and out-works: at a turn of the wall, towards the &s;outh, there was a tower, which, by its projection, flanked the wall towards the gate. Over the fo&s;&s;e there was a draw-bridge to the gate. In this area are the remains of &s;ome edifices, one of which is called Brackenbury's Tower, having deep vaults, now lying open; but as the ground is covered with a thick old orchard, it is impo&s;&s;ible to form any di&s;tinct idea of the former &s;tate of edifices therein. The chief &s;trongholds of this fortre&s;s &s;tand on more elevated ground than any within the areas de&s;cribed; &s;urrounded by a dry ditch or covered way,<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Mr. Gro&s;s de&s;cribes it as out in the rock, but it hath not that appearance when examined &s;trictly. &mdash;Several coins of Edward I. and Edward III. have been found within the ca&s;tle walls, in good pre&s;er|vation; a &s;ilver coin was lately found and brought to the author, the impre&s;&s;ion very di&s;tinct, but the characters or device, not yet explained by any one to whom it has been &s;hewn.

<PB N="247" REF="311">gateways through the cro&s;s or inter&s;ecting walls; this ditch is terminated on one hand by a &s;ally-port that commanded the bridge to the we&s;t, and perhaps was anciently of u&s;e to &s;cour the pa&s;e under the wall, now Briggate &s;treet; and the other &s;ally-port to the north: the covered way almo&s;t &s;urrounding the inner fortre&s;s. The area, in which the chief erections were arranged, is almo&s;t circular, and the buildings are of different aeras. Towards the orchard, the walls are of modern and &s;uperior architecture, &s;upported by &s;trong buttre&s;&s;es, and defended by a &s;quare turret towards the ea&s;t: to the &s;outh, the wall appears very ancient and thick, and has been &s;trengthened, by trains or lines of large oak beams, di&s;po&s;ed in tiers in the centre of the wall, at equal di&s;tances, &s;o as to render it firm again&s;t battering engines: on each &s;ide of the &s;ally-port to the bridge, within the gate, was a &s;emi|circular demi-ba&s;tion, loaded with earth to the top, very &s;trong, and of rough ma&s;on work, built chiefly of blue flints; the greate&s;t part of one of the ba&s;tions &s;till &s;tands; the other, who&s;e foundation only appears, has long been gone to decay. Here are &s;ome of the mo&s;t ancient parts of the ca&s;tle, and probably part of the works of the Baliols.

<P>The environs of this place are remarkably beautiful, and the vale of Tees every where abounds with the noble&s;t and mo&s;t romantic land&s;capes: from Gainford to the head of the river, a cour&s;e of near 30 miles, there is the greate&s;t variety of pic|ture&s;que, pa&s;toral, and augu&s;t &s;cenery, that any vale in the north of England affords. From the ca&s;tle cliffs, northward, you view the river, forming a fine canal above a mile in length; on the one hand, bordered by a hanging fore&s;t of oaks, which climbs a regular a&s;cent of a con&s;iderable height; on the other hand fine meadow lands, inclining gently to the river; the view is terminated by bold cliffs crowned with &s;tately trees, and a farmhold of the Duke of Devon&s;hire's, called Toller-hill-hou&s;e. The walk to Toller-hill is much e&s;teemed; it leads through level pa&s;ture grounds, by the brink of the river, who&s;e banks are beautifully cloathed with wood. The view from Toller-hill-hou&s;e, is at once elegant and augu&s;t; you command the fine canal, the vale, hanging woods, and, at an agreeable di&s;tance, the ruins of Barnard Ca&s;tle ri&s;e nobly on the land&s;cape, in the centre, towering from lofty and broken cliffs; and on each flank, &s;kirting the mount with long ex|tended
<PB N="252" REF="316">tended battlements: the chief parts of the ca&s;tle are &s;een in this view, the circular tower, and the mo&s;t &s;tately parts of the edifice, mantled with ivy; mixing a high colouring, for the painter's imitation; the brown rocks, fringed with bru&s;hwood, the brighter yellow towers, the dark and &s;haded battlements, and deep coloured ivy, are contra&s;ted by the azure lake, on who&s;e face they are reflected. Behind the ruins, the tower of the church, and &s;ome of the highe&s;t hou&s;es are &s;een; and the back ground inclines in a beautiful manner towards the chief objects, yielding the &s;oft, yellow, and azure tints to the land&s;cape. The pa&s;ture ground, called the Flatts, afford a fine terrace; a long level is formed on the brow of the hill, which, tradition informs us, was the old parade, or array ground, for the garri&s;on of the ca&s;tle; here the land&s;capes are various, you look upon the ruins and the bridge; you have a view up the winding vale of Deepdale, beautifully fringed with an indented fore&s;t; and taking a large &s;tretch of the country northward, with a pro&s;pect of the elegant new-built man&s;ion at Lartington, the &s;eat of Henry Maire, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> At the extremity of the Flatts, is a walk on the &s;ummit of a deep and wooded dell, for a mile in length: a path is cut through the hanging woods, by the margin of the river, for two miles in length. South-ea&s;tward, lie the deme&s;ne lands, let out in pa&s;turage, con&s;tantly open to the inhabitants for exerci&s;e and plea&s;ure. By the path which lies on the margin of the river, through level meads, you are led to a new bridge, of one arch, over the river Tees, built by John Sawrey Morrit, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> of Rokeby Park: from this bridge, two excellent fine land|&s;capes pre&s;ent them&s;elves. To the north-we&s;t, you look up the river, which falls in innumerable ca&s;cades, foaming over rocks of porphyry; on the right, a hang|ing fore&s;t crowns the cliffs: the extreme objects are the church, and part of the town of Barnard Ca&s;tle; to the left, and in front, the beautiful ruins of Egle&s;ton Abbey, cover the &s;ummit of a bold eminence; a thick and &s;olemn fore&s;t &s;preads a deep &s;hade behind the ruins, and adds greatly to their awful magnificence. To the &s;outh-ea&s;t, you command a long tract of the river's cour&s;e, through a &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion of rocks, who&s;e &s;ummits are fringed with &s;tately trees; to terminate this augu&s;t avenue, at the di&s;tance of a mile, &s;tands the delightful and elegant villa of Rokeby, with the park, one of the &s;weete&s;t retirements on the banks of Tees.</P>
<P>WESTWICK is a &s;mall village, half a mile di&s;tant from Barnard Ca&s;tle, towards the ea&s;t.

<P>(A) <HI>For the i&s;&s;ue of Sir George &s;ee the other &s;ide,</HI></P></NOTE></P>
<P>The village of Stainton, called in &s;ome of the records, <HI>Stainton Law</HI> and <HI>Stainton en les Craggs,</HI> lies to the north, di&s;tant from Ca&s;tle Barnard about two miles, is &s;ituated on a very expo&s;ed &s;ituation, and on the brink of large free-&s;tone quarries, from whence the materials for the principal edifices in the neighbour|hood have, for many years, been obtained: great part of the ca&s;tle of Barnard is built of &s;tone, got from thence. Stainton, though now a mean and incon&s;iderable village, was of &s;ome note in earlier times: it was one of the villages re&s;igned to the Earls of Northumberland, and never re&s;tored to the &s;ee. Streatlam was ano|ther
<PB REF="317">
<PB REF="318">
<PB N="253" REF="319">ther village, under the &s;ame re&s;ignation. The &s;ame per&s;ons po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing Streatlam and Stainton for &s;everal ages, obliges us to carry on an account of the two places together: great part of Stainton is &s;till united with Streatlam; a &s;mall e&s;tate therein belongs to the family of Hutton, of Ma&s;k, in Richmond&s;hire. Streat|lam and Stainton were part of the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of the Baliols, and came to the family of Bowes, in the beginning of the 14th century. Bernard Baliol, Baron of Bywell, and grandfather to the King of Scots, gave Streatlam and Stainton, Broomlaw, Barforth, Cleatlam, O&s;mond Cro&s;t, and Huller Bu&s;h, in dowry with Agnes his neice, on her marriage with Sir John Trayne. This Agnes was the daughter and &s;ole heir of Ralph de le Hay, Lord Percy; and Sir Adam Bowes married Alice, the daughter and &s;ole heir of the before named Sir John Trayne, and Agnes his wife, and by that marriage, the large po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of tho&s;e families centered in Bowes. Among&s;t the records of St. Mary's, it is &s;aid, there was an entry in a book, relative to the foundation of the mona&s;tery, to the following effect: <Q>Alanus Niger Comes Richmondiae unus &s;undatorum hujus mona&s;terij. &startq;I&s;te Alanus Niger. frater Ducis Brittainae intravit Angliam in exercitu Willi'mi Conque&s;toris, cui dictus Willimus contulit pro &s;ervicio &s;uo Dominium et co|mitatum Richmond: Et po&s;tea idem Alanus primus Com.

<P>We cannot give greater antiquity to the ca&s;tle of Streatlam, than the time of Sir John Trayne, and that too, by applying the title of Newca&s;tle (which appears in &s;ome of the records) to this place; and that will bring it nearly to the age of 500 years. Sir William Bowes, in the beginning of the fifteenth century, rebuilt the ca&s;tle after a Norman model, but what was its figure, magnificence, or &s;trength, we cannot even form a conjecture, for the pre&s;ent ca&s;tle was built on the old foundations, in the beginning of this century, on an elegant plan, as to its front; but by retaining many of the old apartments, it is not conveniently laid out. Nothing but a veneration for the ancient &s;eat of the family, could induce Sir William Bowes to erect &s;uch a man&s;ion, in &s;o ineligible a &s;ituation.

<P>FROM Streatlam, pa&s;&s;ing towards Staindrop, you enter into one of the mo&s;t beautiful vales in the county of Durham. On the high grounds above Streat|lam Ca&s;tle, you look down upon the town of Staindrop, &s;eated in the bo&s;om of the valley, having the Ca&s;tle of Raby, with its extended parks and plantations, on the left, and on the other hand, a fine &s;weep of country, highly cultivated, incli|ning

It is well built, and is &s;urrounded with excellent lands. This is a place of antiquity, being of con|&s;iderable importance in the time of Canuce, who, in veneration of Saint Cuthbert, during the epi&s;copacy of Eadmund Bi&s;hop of Durham, gave his man&s;ion hou&s;e of Staindrop, with its appendages, as an offering at the holy &s;hrine: Symeon, and the other authors,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vol. I. with the autho|rities noted. Vide al&s;o Lumbarde's Dict. p. 324, referring to Chron.

Bi&s;hop Flambard looked upon the territory, which the mona&s;tery held by the royal gift, with eyes of jealou&s;y, and &s;eized the dominion of Staindrop|&s;hire into his hands; but in the hour of contrition, on the approaches of death, he made re&s;titution to the church, and yielded up tho&s;e po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions. The convent, &s;oon after the bi&s;hop's death, in the year 1131, whil&s;t Algar was prior, granted Staindrop and Staindrop&s;hire to Dolphin, de&s;cended of Uchtred, to be holden of him in capite, re&s;erving the yearly rent of four pounds.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Te&s;tib.

In the year 1343, Ralph de Nevill obtained licence from prior John Fo&s;&s;our and the convent, to found three chauntries in the church of Staindrop: how the convent became en|titled to exerci&s;e this juri&s;diction, is not ea&s;y to prove; the records remain &s;ilent, &s;ave as to the fact: Bi&s;hop Bury then held the &s;ee, and the rolls of his time &s;hew no confirmatory in&s;trument. It &s;hould &s;eem, that the convent had re&s;erved the church, in their grant to Dolphin.

No. of burials la&s;t year, 40 Inhabitants 1200.</P></NOTE> I hard that afore Rafe of Raby
<PB N="261" REF="327">time, ther was that alonly, that now is the &s;outh i&s;le. In this &s;outh i&s;l&eacute;, as I hard, was buried the grauntfather and grandedam of Rafe Raby, and they made a cantuarie there. In the waule of this i&s;le, appere the tumbes and images of three ladys, wherof one hath a crounet, and a tumbe of a man childe, and a flat tumbe varii marmoris. Ther is a flat tumbe al&s;o, with a playn image of bra&s;&s;e, and a &s;cripture wher is buried Richard &s;un and heire to Edward, Lord of Ber|gevenny. This Edward was the fir&s;t &s;un of Daraby; Johanna Bewfort was his mother. This Edward had an other &s;un caullid George, and was lord after: and he had George al&s;o lord, and he left Henry, now Lord Bergevenney. John, by Rafe's fir&s;t wife, was Lord Neville; Richard, by Johan his &s;econd wife, was Erle of Sare&s;byri; Robert was By&s;hop of Dure&s;me; George was Lord Latimer; Edward was Lord Bergevenny, and as I remember Rafe had Will. that was Lord Falconbridge. Rafe Neville, the fir&s;t Erle of We&s;tmerland of that name, is buried yn a right &s;tately tumbe of alaba&s;ter yn in the quire of Stanthorp college, and Margarete his fir&s;t wife, on the left hond of hym; and on the right hond lyith the image of Johan his &s;econd wife: but &s;he is buried at Lincoln, by her mother Catarine Swinesford, Duche&s;s of Lanca&s;ter. Ther rennith by the north &s;ide of the college, a bek, caullid Langley Bek; it ri&s;ith at five miles of, by we&s;t, in the paroch of Middleton, and cumming thorough Langley, tak|ith the name of it, and a mile or more beneth goith into Te&s;e, lower than Sala|by, &endq;Mr. Brakenbyrie's place.</Q> In the de&s;cription of this church, occa&s;ions will offer to make remarks upon what is quoted from Leland; the chancel is in length 16 paces, and in width &s;ix paces; within the altar rails in the &s;outh wall, are three niches or &s;talls for the officiating prie&s;ts. It is lighted to the ea&s;t, with a large window, under a circular arch; two windows to the north, and three to the &s;outh, under pointed arches; the arms of Nevills, with quarterings, and the arms of England, in &s;tained gla&s;s, in the ca&s;t window. The chancel is &s;talled with oak, twelve &s;talls on each &s;ide; and, &s;ome few years ago, was greatly crowded with two large table monuments, one of alaba&s;ter, the other of wood, highly decorated, having recumbent effigies, of excellent workman&s;hip. The alaba&s;ter tomb &s;tands neare&s;t to the altar. Leland was not informed where Margaret, the fir&s;t wife of Ralph, Earl of We&s;tmorland, was interred; &s;he was the daughter of Hugh, Earl of Stafford, died the 9th of June, 1370, and was buried at Brancepeth: his &s;econd wife, Johan, daughter of the Duke of Lanca&s;ter, died the 13th November, 1440, and was buried at Lincoln. On this tomb lie three effigies in alaba&s;ter; the effigy of the Earl, repre&s;ents him in complete armour, except the helmet, on which the head is re&s;ted, bearing the cre&s;t, a bull's head; the &s;culcap, which is much broken, has on the front, I. H. S. in the old character; the hands are elevated, in gauntlets, on the brea&s;t the cro&s;s; the legs are extended, &s;purs on the heels, and the feet re&s;ting on a lion. The ladies heads are re&s;ted on cu&s;hions, &s;upported by cherubs, and at the feet of each &s;igure, is a de&s;k with two kneeling clerks. Around the tomb are niches, ornamented with tabernacle work; but no in&s;cription. The &s;econd tomb is of wood, and has three recumbent figures, al&s;o cut in wood. A plate of it is given in the Antiquarian Repertory, from a drawing of Mr. Bailey's. This is the monument of Henry, the fifth Earl of We&s;tmorland; he married, to
<PB N="262" REF="328">his fir&s;t wife, Anne, daughter of Thomas Manners, Earl of Rutland, by whom he had i&s;&s;ue, an only &s;on, Charles: Jane, his &s;econd wife, was daughter of Sir Richard Chomley, Knight; his third wife was called Margaret, but her family, we believe, is not noted. He died 9th Feb. 1564, and by his will, dated 18th of Aug. 1563, directed his body to be buried in the pari&s;h church of Staindrop, under the tomb that was la&s;t made, near to the lady Jane his wife. An in&s;cription is rai&s;ed round the edge of the table, in the&s;e words: <Q>This tomb made in the yere of wr Lord &startq;God, 1560, and in the &s;econd yere of Elezabeth bi the grace of God Quene of England, Franc and Ierland, defendor of the faith bi the commandament of the right Honorable Hen. Erle of We&s;tmerland for him&s;elf and his thre wives, that &endq;is to &s;ay, Anne, doughter to therl of Rutland, Jane, Margaret, doughters.</Q> No more remaining. Round the &s;ides of the monument, within a kind of colonade, formed by &s;mall carved pillars, are awkward figures of the children, and above them, in the like character, the names of Elenor, Kathrin, Ralfe, Charls, Edward, Shon, Adeli, with a &s;eventh, who&s;e name is defaced. On the ends, are carved, the arms of the family, with a multitude of quarterings. His effigy is cut with a curled head, and pointed beard, a &s;uit of armour, the hands elevated, without gauntlets; the legs extended, and the feet re&s;ted on a greyhound. The hands of the ladies are elevated, and the dre&s;&s;es remarkably awkward, and without ornament. The chancel is divided from the nave by a pointed arch; an elegant &s;eat is formed where the roodloft was for the reception of Lord Darlington's family. The nave is regular, having two &s;ide ailes, each formed by five pillars; two to the ea&s;t in each row, are round, with capitals garni&s;hed with ro&s;es; the two next are clu&s;tered pillars; the la&s;t, to the we&s;t, is clu&s;tered, but remarkably heavy, compo&s;ed of va|rious irregular parts. The arches are circular, except the la&s;t to the we&s;t, which is pointed, and &s;upports the tower: the arches in the &s;outh row, are ornamented with the zizag figure, tho&s;e on the north row have not that ornament, which gives much colour to what Leland &s;ays, that originally there was only an aile to the &s;outh, which was appropriated for the interment of the ancient family of the hou&s;e of Raby, as appears by the tombs in the wall; where our author &s;ays, they made a cantuary or chauntry. It is before ob&s;erved, that in 1343, Ralph de Nevill ob|tained licence for founding three chauntries in this church, and it is probable the &s;outh aile was originally a porch for this pious purpo&s;e. There are two arches in the &s;outh wall, one of which appears to have been con&s;tructed for a &s;uperior per&s;onage, for the arch is ornamented with tabernacle work, at the &s;ummit of which is a bracket, as if de&s;igned to &s;upport a &s;mall crucifix or image, with a lamp or light; under this arch, is a recumbent e&s;&s;igy, but it is impo&s;&s;ible to di&s;tingui&s;h whether it is de&s;igned for an eccle&s;ia&s;tic or a female; it has a hood over the head, and the garments go down to the feet; the hands are elevated; near it lies another and the garments go down to the feet; the hands are elevated; near it lies another effigy in the &s;ame habit, that doth not &s;eem to have originally belonged to that place; but when the aile was &s;talled, to have been put there merely to pre&s;erve it. To the ea&s;t of this tomb, are three niches or &s;talls in the wall for the officiating clerks, who performed the ceremonies and ma&s;&s;es for the dead. In the &s;ame wall is a &s;imilar circular arch, but without ornament above it: in this place is another re|cumbent effigy, dre&s;&s;ed like the former, with hands elevated, and the effigy of a
<PB N="263" REF="329">child &s;et by it, not &s;eeming to belong to the place. The figure, with a coronet, de&s;cribed by Leland; doth not lie in either of the&s;e rece&s;&s;es, nor is to be found in the church at this time. If there are any in&s;criptions on the&s;e monuments, they are &s;o covered with the &s;talls, as not to be &s;een at this time. Mo&s;t of the bra&s;s work is gone from the tomb-&s;tone, which, Leland &s;ays, covered the remains of Richard, &s;on of Edward, Lord Abergaveny: two of the e&s;cucheons of arms re|main.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vid.

<P>After the di&s;&s;olution, this church remained in the crown, until King Charles I. created it a vicarage, at the petition of Sir Henry Vane, and thereby authori&s;ed Bi&s;hop Morton to in&s;titute a proper clerk, who &s;hould have capacity of taking lands and tenements; and Sir Henry was impowered to grant lands, tenements, rents, &s;ervices, and other pro&s;its, be&s;ides what King James had granted thereto; and he al&s;o thereby granted to Sir Henry and his heirs, the perpetual advow&s;on, pre&s;entation, and right of patronage of the church for ever.</P>
<P>About a mile to the north of Staindrop, is RABY CASTLE, the &s;eat of the Earl of Darlington: a noble pile of &s;tately towers, retaining all the appearance of its antiquity, and giving the mo&s;t perfect idea of a great baron's palace in the &s;eudal ages. It &s;tands on an eminence, is founded on a rock, and is &s;urrounded with a parapet and embrazured wall, together with a deep fo&s;&s;e. It is probable, from the excellent &s;ituation, that on this plot of ground &s;tood Canute's man&s;ion, which he gave to the church with Staindrop, indi&s;criminately mentioned by ancient authors with Staindrop, and covered by that appellation. One of the towers, is of &s;o &s;ingular a figure, that it prompts a conjecture of its being of great antiquity; we have no examples, that we recollect, of Dani&s;h architecture in the north, to afford a compari&s;on; we can only make a &s;uppo&s;ition, that this bulwark was of that aera, and from its de&s;cription, leave the reader to determine the probability of the idea. Leland vi&s;ited this ca&s;tle long before the forfeiture, and whil&s;t the family of Nevills were in great magnificence.<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">The great po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of the Nevills in this county, will be&s;t appear by reference to the inq. po&s;t mort. taken on the death of Ra.

This Mildred had a &s;unne caullid Robert, and Robert had a doughter and heire caullid Emme, by whom the Nevilles had Raby. Ribaldus frater Alani niger Comitis Brittanniae et Richemonte, was lord of Middleham, and by marriage with an heire generall of this line, the Nevilles cam to Middleham. Da Raby, the fir&s;t Erle of We&s;t|merland, had a xx children by his wifes. Mary, one of the Lady Nevilles of Raby, was buried at Coverham, and her hu&s;band to, as I remember. From St. Andres Akeland to Raby Ca&s;tel 5 miles, part by arable, but more by pa&s;tures and mori&s;ch hilly ground, baron of wood. Raby is the large&s;t ca&s;tel of log|gingees in all the north countery, and is of a &s;trong building, but not &s;et other on hill, or very &s;trong ground. As I enterid by a cau&s;ey, into it ther was a litle &s;tagne on the right honde; and in the fir&s;t area, were but two towres on a ech ende as entres, and no other buildid; yn the 2 area, as in entring was a great gate of iren with a tour, and 2 or 3 mo on the right hond. Then were al the chief toures of the 3 court, as in the hart of the ca&s;tel. The haul and al the hou&s;es of offices be large and &s;tately; and in the haul I &s;aw an incredible great beame of an hart. The great chambre was exceeding large, but now it is fals rofid and dividid into 2 or 3 partes. I &s;aw ther a litle chambre wherin was in windowes of colerid gla&s;&s;e al the petigre of the Nevilles: but it is now taken down and gla&s;id with clere gla&s;&s;e. Ther is a tower in the ca&s;tel, having the mark of 2 capitale <HI>b</HI>'s from Bertram Bulmer. Ther is another tower, bering the name of Jane, ba&s;tard &s;i&s;ter to Henry IV. and wife to Rafe Neville the fir&s;t Erl of We&s;tmerland. Ther long 3 parkes to Raby, whereof 2 be pleni&s;hed

<P>We will take a cur&s;ory view of what modern vi&s;itors have &s;aid of this place, previous to a more minute de&s;cription. The ingenious Mr. Gro&s;e, in his Antiquities of England and Wales, has pre&s;ented us with two views of this ca&s;tle, attended with de&s;criptions, and al&s;o a plate of the ground plot. <Q>The &s;ituation, &startq;in a park, beautifully admitting a view of the deer, is rather pa&s;toral than romantic, being on the &s;ide of a va&s;t amphitheatre of country, which affords a pro&s;pect of a rich cultivation, terminated by we&s;t and ea&s;t by di&s;tant hills, and to the &s;outh by an extended plain, exhibiting that freedom now &s;o much pur&s;ued in rural &s;peculations. On the other hand, the nearer parts of the horizon are charmingly verged by plantations rai&s;ed by the pre&s;ent noble owner, who, in every part of a very extended property, gives the highe&s;t proof of his attention and ta&s;te. Although the &s;urrounding country boa&s;ts not much of the marvellous and &s;ublime in nature, yet the deficiency of &s;uch objects &s;eems amply &s;upplied, in another &s;tile, by the growing elegance of every reform, where convenience, profit, and order, are happily blended. The ca&s;tle, with its nearly circular terrace, inclo&s;ed within a military wall, is &s;aid to mea&s;ure two acres, and the deme&s;nes annexed, to exceed thirty miles in length. As it is not the plan of this work, to delineate the face of a country, and &s;till le&s;s to enter into agricul|tural projects, we &s;hall only ob&s;erve, that the family has, for &s;everal years, carried &endq;forward exten&s;ive improvements.</Q></P>

<P>In his &s;econd de&s;cription, he repeats what is before given from Leland's Itinerary; and proceeds with de&s;criptive notes, communicated by Mr. Pennant, many of which are judicious and highly pertinent, and will ornament the following de&s;crip|tion: in the book entitled a New Di&s;play of the Beauties of England, Raby is thus &s;poken of&mdash; <Q>It is a noble ma&s;&s;y building of its kind, uninjured by any &startq;modern &s;trokes, incon&s;i&s;tent with the general ta&s;te of the edifice; but &s;imply magnificent, it &s;trikes by its magnitude, and that idea of &s;trength and command naturally annexed to the view of va&s;t walls, lofty towers, battlements, and the &s;urrounding out-works of an old baron's re&s;idence. The building it&s;elf, be&s;ides the courts, covers an acre of land; the &s;ize may from thence be concluded. The &s;outh front of it is very beautiful, the centre is from a de&s;ign of Inigo Jones; nothing in the Gothic ta&s;te can be more elegant than the &s;tile and proportion of the windows. The rooms are very numerous, and more modern in their pro|portion and di&s;tribution, than one would ea&s;ily conceive to be po&s;&s;ible within the walls of &s;o ancient a building; but, by means of numerous pa&s;&s;ages and clo&s;ets, many of which have been &s;cooped out of the walls, and back-&s;tairs, the apartments are extremely convenient, well connected, and at the &s;ame time perfectly di&s;tinct: &s;everal improvements have been lately made, which add greatly to the &s;paciou&s;ne&s;s and convenience of the apartments in general. The bed chambers and dre&s;&s;ing-rooms are of a good &s;ize and proportion, and &s;ome of the lower apartments large and elegantly fitted up. One of the drawing|rooms is thirty feet by twenty; and the adjoining dining-room is fifty-one by twenty-one; the windows of both of plate gla&s;s, and in the &s;malle&s;t and lighe&s;t of bra&s;s frames. Near the dining-room there is a rendezvous apartment, ninety feet long, thirty-&s;ix broad, and thirty-&s;ix high; a proportion that plea&s;es the eye at the very entrance; an addition of thirty feet in length is now making, terminated by a circular tower, in the &s;ame &s;tile as the re&s;t of the ca&s;tle; by which means the &s;outh front is greatly improved, and the room receives not only an additional &s;pace, but the light of a circular window. The park and orna|mented grounds around the ca&s;tle are di&s;po&s;ed with very great ta&s;te. The lawns, woods, and plantations, are objects remarkably beautiful. Entering the lawn from the plantations near the hou&s;e, the whole &s;weep has a very fine effect. The dog-kennel, a Gothic ornamented building, is &s;een on one &s;ide ri&s;ing out of a fine wood, and beautifying the &s;cene much: upon the hill, to the right, is a Gothic farm-hou&s;e, a &s;imple but plea&s;ing de&s;ign, in a very fine &s;ituation; in front, along the valley, &s;everal clumps of trees are &s;cattered, and between them a farm-hou&s;e belonging his lord&s;hip, on a di&s;tant ri&s;ing hill; a building which greatly ornaments the grounds. This part of the lawn is finely inclo&s;ed on three &s;ides with thriving plantations. This leads into the extended part of the lawn, which is, for its extent, as beautiful a one as can any where be &s;een: the inequality of the ground is remarkably favourable to its beauty; it con&s;i&s;ts of fine &s;weeps of gra&s;s, &s;tretching away to the right and left over hills mo&s;t elegantly &s;pread with plantations on each &s;ide, and pre&s;enting to the eye a fine waving uninterrupted &s;urface through a valley, till it lo&s;es it&s;elf in &s;uch a manner among the woods, as to give room to the imagination to play
<PB N="269" REF="337">and picture an extent &s;uperior to the reality. In front, upon a fine ri&s;ing hill, is &s;ituated the farm-yard, with a mo&s;t elegant Gothic &s;creen in it. From this hill, you look back on a very fine &s;cene. To the left, the whole is bounded by a mo&s;t noble range of planted hanging hills, which extend to the woods in front, &s;urrounding the ca&s;tle in a mo&s;t picture&s;que manner: the hollow &s;coops of lawn are peculiarly beautiful. To the right it has a noble &s;weep through the valley, with a prodigious exten&s;ive pro&s;pect over it to Ro&s;bury-topping, (in Cleveland:) nothing can be more beautiful than this whole view, which is compo&s;ed of the mo&s;t elegant di&s;po&s;ition of the ground imaginable; the hanging hills &s;pread with wood, the hollow &s;coops of gra&s;s, &s;pacious lawns, and di&s;tant pro&s;pect upon the whole, fill the eye and plea&s;e the imagination. Winding up to the right, and moving along the terrace, which is a natural one, but leads through an exten&s;ive plantation, the views it commands are fine. You look down upon the farm, and the hills upon which it &s;tands, which waves through the valley in a mo&s;t plea&s;ing manner: throwing your eye more in front, you catch a lake breaking upon the view in irregular &s;heets of the water, ju&s;t over the tops of the lower woods; the effect mo&s;t truly picture&s;que. Upon the right, the whole valley is commanded, and the village of Staindrop, well &s;ituated among inclo&s;ures and &s;traggling trees. Advancing, the pro&s;pect varies; a fine &s;weep of cultivated hill is &s;een upon the left, and the Gothic farm-hou&s;e, ornamenting all the &s;urrounding grounds; de&s;cending into the vale, you catch the village and church of Staindrop mo&s;t picture&s;quely among the trees. Further down, from among the &s;loping woods, through which the riding leads, the ca&s;tle is &s;een ri&s;ing mo&s;t nobly, from a foreground of wood, in a &s;tile truly magnificent. Cro&s;&s;ing this part of the lawn to the lower terrace, you meet with grounds be|fore un&s;een, which are excellently di&s;po&s;ed; the plantations judiciou&s;ly &s;ketched, and the views plea&s;ing. The whole range of ground is &s;een to very great advantage, by riding along the &s;outhern plantation: you there command the whole, from the ca&s;tle on one &s;ide, to the hills beyond the farm hou&s;e on the other; and the &s;weep of plantations here appears very noble. Upon the whole, plantations di&s;po&s;ed with more ta&s;te are no where to be &s;een; none which are &s;ketched with more judgment, for &s;etting off the natural inequalities of the ground, and managed more artfully for pre&s;enting, on a &s;mall &s;pace of land, a large extent of &s;urface to the eye: nor can any thing of the kind be more beautiful than the lawn, which &s;preads among the woods, &s;o as to appear in different &s;weeps, indenting the groves in &s;ome places, and breaking through them in others. No object in the &s;tile of ornament, can be more agreeable to it&s;elf, or more &s;triking from its &s;ituation, than the farm-hou&s;e, which is &s;een from mo&s;t &endq;parts of the ground, and always to advantage.</Q> This de&s;cription would not have been wholly repeated, but, as the greate&s;t part of it came from the pen of a popular writer, from who&s;e Tour it was extracted, and given a place in the periodical work from whence it is now copied, it may be excu&s;ed with all its repetitions.&mdash; There are &s;everal approaches to the ca&s;tle, one for dome&s;tics, another leading to the Darlington road, a third from Staindrop bridge, and a fourth is projected, to lead from the Durham road, near Kever&s;ton hou&s;e; by the road leading from
<PB N="270" REF="338">Staindrop bridge, the approach is remarkable; the vi&s;itor a&s;cends gradually through the park, towards the &s;outh front of the ca&s;tle, which pre&s;ents it&s;elf in the noble&s;t point of view, &s;urrounded with an embrazured wall, and a fo&s;&s;e cut in the &s;olid rock, and flanked with exten&s;ive plantations; the pro&s;pects on each &s;ide open upon the view, as the traveller advances. The back-ground, though near to the chief objects, ri&s;es boldly, covered with a fore&s;t. The new projected road, already cut through the wood, as it de&s;cends from hills much higher than the ca&s;tle, will &s;urpri&s;e the traveller by opening abruptly upon the ca&s;tle, and the beautiful vale beneath it; commanding at once the park, and all the walks which &s;urround this noble place, the town of Staindrop, and that long reach of land&s;cape which is terminated by Cleveland hills; and on which the &s;pires of Darlington and Con&s;cliff churches, with a multitude of villages, are &s;triking objects.&mdash; There is but one entrance into the outward area of the ca&s;tle, by a gate on the north &s;ide, guarded with two &s;quare towers, and flanked with a parapet, gar|ni&s;hed with turrets. There are two entrances from thence into the inner area, one opended by the late Lord Darlington, the other an ancient one: the ancient entrance is from the we&s;t, by a double gate and covered way, &s;trengthened by two &s;quare towers, which <HI>flange,</HI> as the builder's term is, or expand from the gate, and pre&s;ent an angle in front: an out&s;ide pa&s;&s;age, from one tower to the other, is formed by a hanging gallery over the gate. Here are three &s;hields of arms of the Nevill family, gartered; which matter determines the antiquity of this gate. The covered way is fourteen paces in length, with a groined roof, and has an inner gate, the arches are circular, and both gates have the portcullis. This gateway, at irregular di&s;tances, is flanked with &s;quare towers: there appears to have been &s;ome modern additions to the &s;outh, which clo&s;e the pa&s;s, and cut off all com|munication with the &s;outhern part of the area or platform, that otherwi&s;e would completely &s;urround the ca&s;tle; and in ancient times, when it was aplace of defence, it is rea&s;onable to believe, would be laid open. In Mr. Gro&s;e's work, it is called a "parade, garni&s;hed with battlements." From the &s;quare tower, which flanks the gate to the north, a hanging gallery forms a communication with a large &s;quare bulwark oppo&s;ite the outward gate, now called Clifford's Tower. The names of &s;everal of the towers have given occa&s;ion for a conjecture, that whil&s;t the ca&s;tle was in the hands of per&s;ons, who&s;e names the towers &s;till retain, they added tho&s;e works thereto: but this idea has no foundation in hi&s;torical facts; and it is to be apprehended the names were given in compliment to di&s;tingui&s;hed per&s;ons, to whom they were con&s;igned to be defended or garri&s;oned. From Clifford's Tower, ca&s;tward, is a hanging gallery which communicates with a &s;maller &s;quare tower, &s;trengthened with turrers. From thence, ea&s;tward, is a modern curtain wall, which conceals a rece&s;s, and adjoins to a gateway, lately formed between two &s;mall &s;quare towers, from whence a pa&s;&s;age is made under the ancient chapel. This entrance is the mo&s;t judicious and elegant improvement the ca&s;tle has received in any age: by this entrance carriages pa&s;s into the large Gothic &s;aloon, the roof of which is arched and <Q>&s;upported by &s;ix pillars, the capitals diverging and running &startq;&endq;in ribs along the root.</Q> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Pennant.</NOTE> A flight of &s;teps leads to the pre&s;ence chamber, a
<PB N="271" REF="339">&s;emi-circular room, where the company &s;et down in the &s;aloon are introduced: from thence pa&s;&s;ages lead to the chief apartments; the carriages pa&s;s through the inner area and covered way, &s;o that a long train of carriages may &s;et down their company without the lea&s;t interference. Above this &s;aloon is a hall <Q>of the fir&s;t &startq;&endq;magnitude,</Q> which forms one &s;ide of the &s;quare of the inner area, <Q>is ninety &startq;feet in length, thirty-&s;ix in breadth, and thirty-four in height; the roof is flat, &endq;and made of wood,</Q> the joints ornamented with &s;hields of arms of the family of the Nevills. <Q>Here a&s;&s;embled, in the time of the Nevills, &s;even hundred knights, &startq;&endq;who held of that family.</Q> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Pennant.</NOTE> A gallery of &s;tone cro&s;&s;es the we&s;t end of this room, u&s;ed in ancient times for mu&s;ic, and that mimicry, with which our ance&s;tors were &s;o much plea&s;ed.&mdash;From the gateway, a modern curtain wall runs to a lofty tower, which appears to be of the highe&s;t antiquity of any part of this ca&s;tle; its figure is that of an ancient arrow-head, with the &s;harp edge or point to the &s;outh; it has four tiers of apartments or floors, and the battlements are garni&s;hed with turrets on the three angles to the &s;outh, to which you a&s;cend by eighty-nine &s;teps: the ma&s;onry is excellent, the front is chi&s;&s;elled, the joints are compact, and the interior parts of the walls are run with hot lime: from the top is a mo&s;t exten&s;ive view &s;outh-ea&s;tward, in which are comprehended, and di&s;tinctly &s;een, Con&s;cliff, Darlington, Sadberg, Long-Newton, Stockton, with Cleveland and Hamilton hills, at the greate&s;t di&s;tance. The eminence where Heighington &s;tands, cuts off the view further to the left hand. Near the &s;ummit of this tower, are rai&s;ed in the &s;tone work two letters in the old character, <HI>h,</HI> from whence, and the name this tower now bears, it has been inferred, that it was built by Bertram Bulmer, a con|jecture refuted by the circum&s;tance before mentioned, as to Clifford's Tower: perhaps it was repaired under the directions of Bulmer, and was then named in compliment, on account of the intermarriage of the families; it now &s;tands de|tached from the re&s;t of the ca&s;tle, and it is &s;aid, was &s;eparated by a fire, which con&s;umed the intermediate erections. This is the part of the ca&s;tle, on which we pre&s;umed to rai&s;e a conjecture, that it owed its origin to Canute, if any part of the edifice can be attributed to that age. The &s;ingularity of the figure leads to the &s;uppo&s;ition: neither the towers attributed to the Anglo-Saxons, nor the Norman ca&s;tles, in any in&s;tance that we have ob&s;erved, &s;hew a geometrical figure any thing like this: Bertram Bulmer's heire&s;s married Galfrid de Nevill, and he died in the fifth year of Richard 1. 1194, and their daughter and heire&s;s married Robert, the &s;on of Maldred, Lord of Raby; from whence the idea of this being Bulmer's Tower gathers little &s;upport; the &s;econd Bertram was de&s;cended of a younger branch, and was Lord of Bulmer: it is mo&s;t probable the letters are denominative of the year in which the repairs were made, and that b was then dominical; of which application we have an in&s;tance in an in&s;cription in Con&s;cliff church, before noted. From this tower you advance to the &s;outh front. After the de&s;criptions before quoted, little more need to be added, in order to impre&s;s on the reader's mind an idea of the magnificence of this ancient &s;tucture. Speaking of &s;ome of the apartments, Mr. Gro&s;e, from Mr. Pennant's Notes, &s;ays,&mdash; <Q>In the breakfa&s;t room, the rece&s;&s;es are &startq;in the form of &s;emi-circles, &s;cooped out, I may &s;ay, of the walls, which are nine &s;eet one inch thick; a window is in each of the&s;e. I &s;aw al&s;o a rece&s;s for a bed,
<PB N="272" REF="340">gained out of the wall, and &s;everal other conveniences and communications quarried out of it; and in &s;ome places pillars are left, as in collieries, to &s;up|port the roof. The oven was of dimen&s;ions &s;uited to the ho&s;pitality of tho&s;e times, higher than a tall per&s;on, for the talle&s;t may &s;tand upright in it; and I think its diameter mu&s;t be fifteen feet. At pre&s;ent it is converted into a wine cellar; the &s;ides are divided into ten parts, and each holds a hog&s;head of wine in bottles. The kitchen is a magnificent and lofty &s;quare, has three chimneys, one for the grate, a &s;econd for &s;toves, the third for the great chaldrons. The top is arched, and a &s;mall cupolo lights it in the centre; but on the &s;ides are five windows, with a gallery pa&s;&s;ing all round before them, and four &s;teps from each, pointing down into the kitchen, but ending a great height above the floor: their u&s;e is not known. From the floor, is another &s;tairca&s;e that conducts to the great hall, but the pa&s;&s;age is now &s;topped.&mdash;What hecatombs mu&s;t have been &endq;carried that way.</Q> To this account mu&s;t be added, that the kitchen is a &s;quare of thirty feet; the &s;ide where no chimney is, opens into the larders: oppo&s;ite to the grate, the &s;teps de&s;cend to the floor, and are wide enough for three per&s;ons abrea&s;t: on each of the other &s;ides, to the right and left of the grate, are two windows, with five &s;teps de&s;cending, but not low enough to enable the per&s;ons who &s;hould &s;tand thereon, to receive any thing from tho&s;e in the kitchen: there are narrow pa&s;&s;es channelled in the walls, but not capacious enough, we conceive, to allow a per&s;on to bear a di&s;h of provi&s;ions for the 700 knights and retainers of the Nevills. Did not this place bear &s;o great a re&s;emblance to many of the old mona&s;tic kitchens, one would be apt to conjecture it was u&s;ed formerly as an armory, from whence the in&s;truments of war, bows, arrows, &s;pears, javelins, &amp;c. could be di&s;tributed quickly to all parts of the ca&s;tle. There are &s;everal good paintings in the chief apartments; in the dining-room in Clifford's Tower, is a large mu&s;ic piece, containing the group of figures Rubens placed in the centre of the marriage fea&s;t of Canaan, in which he di&s;po&s;ed his own portrait as a chief mu&s;ician, with his cotemporaries as performers: this painting is in good character, but no author named. In the &s;ame room is an excellent portrait of Lord Mansfield, and there are many others of per&s;onages connected with the pre&s;ent family, in that room, and di&s;tributed in other apartments. It mu&s;t be added to the former de&s;cription of the park and plea&s;ure grounds, that the terrace where it lies open, beyond the pa&s;s through the plantations, is &s;even hundred and &s;ixty paces in length, and commands a noble pro&s;pect. In the front ground, the canal is a beautiful object, lying in the bo&s;om of a park, ornamented with tho&s;e improvements which art can only give, when applied to &s;often and not di&s;tort the face of nature; over the planta|tions, which &s;kirt the park, Staindrop church, with parts of the town, are &s;een; from thence to the ea&s;t, Sellaby-hou&s;e and wood; further advanced, are the villages of Hilton, Ingleton, and Langton; and a di&s;tant &s;weep of cultivated country, which, with a richne&s;s of colouring, prepares the eye to receive the terminating objects, Hamilton hills, in York&s;hire, mixing their azure hue with the &s;ky. In front, over the beautiful foreground, with Staindrop before mentioned, you command a view towards Forcet, with the conic eminence called Dider&s;dale Hill, on Gatherley Moor, the arrangement of clumps and plantations above Sir Thomas Dundas's &s;eat
<PB N="273" REF="341">at A&s;k, with the church and village of Kirby Raven&s;worth: the villages of Gales and Barningham, and a hanging land&s;cape dotted with woodlands, &s;urmounted by the brown mountains of Hope and Arkendale: to the we&s;tward, an inclining tract of cultivated country, with the road leading to Barnard Ca&s;tle; the vale filled with the woods of Streatlam and Lady Clo&s;e. From the terrace, the grounds of the park lie in an ea&s;y &s;lope to the bath hou&s;e, covered with fine plantations.</P>
<P>The late Lord Darlington's farm and farm-yard, were objects de&s;erving the be&s;t attention; the farm included lands of the annual value of 1200 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> wherein every noble erection, for u&s;eful knowledge in hu&s;bandry and beneficial improvement in modern agriculture were practi&s;ed; his lord&s;hip retained one ancient u&s;age, which gave plea&s;ure to every eye; in his farm, you might &s;ee the tillage land ploughed by between twenty and thirty teems of four oxen each; the cu&s;tom of tilling with hor&s;es not prevailing with his better judgment. In the farm-yard were clo&s;e &s;tands for upwards of forty oxen, be&s;ides an open &s;pacious fold, with a ci&s;tern of water con&s;tantly running: there were covered racks and pens for eight hundred &s;heep, with other conveniences, of barn room, &s;heds, &s;tables and offices, &s;uitable to the magnitude of the farm: the common pa&s;ture exceeds three hundred acres: this was a trea&s;ure of enjoyment and health to his lord&s;hip; and an example worthy the emulation of every lover of his country. The pre&s;ent earl is attentively engaged in the defence of his country, as Lord Lieutenant of the county of Durham, and Colonel of the Militia.</P>

<P>Above the gateway of the &s;creen which covers the farm-yard, is a large &s;culpture of a bull, bearing an en&s;ign of the Nevills' arms, and over the &s;houlder a mantle, with the &s;ame arms; this, it is &s;aid, was removed from the towers, above the new entrance into the Gothic &s;aloon.

<HEAD>THE PARISH OF MIDDLETON.</HEAD>
<P>RETURNING towards the river Tees, we enter upon the large common called Barnard Ca&s;tle moor, before mentioned, and pa&s;s along the &s;ide of the vale of Langley dale, in our approach to Egle&s;ton, a chapelry in the pari&s;h of Middleton, for the &s;ake of di&s;tinction called Middleton in Tee&s;edal. Near the head of the moor is Bail-Hill, defended to the &s;outh by a brea&s;t-work and deep trench, terminating in a mora&s;s. This is a well cho&s;en &s;pot for an army of ob&s;er|vation, or detachment of &s;couts, as it commands an exten&s;ive pro&s;pect down Langley dale, and along the whole range of hills above Raby; you view Merrington and We&s;terton, the latter of which places lies two miles ea&s;t of Bi&s;hop Auckland; Bru&s;leton Tower above We&s;t Auckland, Hilton Town, Heighington, and all the vale to the &s;outhward, with Cleveland hills, &s;tretching away to the Tee&s;mouth; and to the &s;outh-we&s;t the York&s;hire hills, with the vale of Tees, and various villages and hamlets, &s;cattered along the river's banks: the &s;tation has only been temporary, perhaps made on &s;ome incur&s;ion of the Scots, as a &s;afeguard from attack by troops lying &s;outhward, or the garri&s;ons of Ca&s;tle Barnard and Raby. Many coins of Edward I. and &s;ome of Alexander of Scotland were found near this place. Pa&s;s Shipley Hou&s;e, called in the old records Marwood Hag, on the left, a farm belonging to the family of Bowes, and by them purcha&s;ed of the Simp&s;ons.

In 1632, Child and Britain conveyed the manor to Tobias Ewbank, of Staindrop; from whom it came by purcha&s;e to the family of Sander&s;ons, and in the beginning of this century was &s;old to Mr. Hutchin&s;on's ance&s;tor. There are lead-mines in this di&s;trict, which have been wrought &s;ince the time of Edward VI. as appears by authentic records:
<PB N="277" REF="345">it is probable the Romans wrought the mines here, for various ancient workings have been di&s;covered, and tools and implements found therein, the u&s;e of which was not known to the mo&s;t experienced miners of this age: they knew, or at lea&s;t practi&s;ed in Britain few mechanical powers; and when they met with foul air or water in the mines, they were obliged to de&s;i&s;t; &s;o that in both lead and coal-mines, their workings could never be deep, or indeed very material. There are &s;everal ancient ba&s;ons, formed of &s;tone-work, &s;cattered over the moor, wherein lead-ore was &s;melted, or run by force of fuel heaped upon it, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the wind, before a mill or bellows was u&s;ed.</P>

A farm of land, called Foggerthwaite, to the north of Egle&s;ton, was part of the ancient po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of the Scroops, in 1638 was conveyed by Lady Scroop to Anthony Maxon, and afterwards came to Sir Nicholas Tempe&s;t: this, with an old man&s;ion and farm called Stotley, near adjoining, which anciently belonged to the family of Cumins, are part of the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of the Bowe&s;es.</P>

<P>Proceeding by the foot of Foggerthwaite inclo&s;ures, the road hangs on the river's banks; and the view into the vale, though narrowed, comparing it with the pro&s;pect from Foxgyll, comprehends a land&s;cape much more elegant, as many objects are opened to the eye, which were from the other &s;tation concealed by the interpo&s;ition of high lands. The foreground here is rocky, rugged, and extremely wild; from whence you look into the valley, which forms a cre&s;cent: to the ea&s;t, the river, in its various windings, exhibits &s;ix di&s;tinct canals, having Egle&s;ton levels on one &s;ide, wooded banks and ri&s;ing inclo&s;ures on the other; the town of Romaldkirk, with the tower of the church, &s;inely emerging from a thick grove, in the centre; Shipley-hou&s;e, and &s;teep hanging inclo&s;ures, to the north; the York|&s;hire

To the north, the windings of the river through a fine plain are beautiful; on the right is a conical eminence, crowned with fir trees, and &s;kirted with bru&s;hwood, round which the river winds; above that object, &s;tands the little village of <HI>London,</HI> &s;urmounted with columnarious and rugged rocks, and pent in by barren and &s;haken mountains: part of the town of Middleton is &s;een over the verdant vale, and all above are mountains crowding behind mountains.</P>

<PB N="280" REF="348">of the chain, and &s;ees him&s;elf &s;u&s;pended over a roaring gulph, on an agitated, re&s;tle&s;s gang-way, to which few &s;trangers dare tru&s;t them&s;elves.</P>
<P>Two miles further up the river, in a retired &s;ituation, on the brink of the &s;tream, is a hou&s;e, the property of the Rev. Mr. Zouch, called <HI>Frier Hou&s;e,</HI> probably built on the &s;ite of an old hermitage, the e&s;tate being part of the ancient po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of the mona&s;tery of Riveaux; a mile from thence is the great fall of the river, called THE FORCE. The &s;pectacle is truly noble, and the &s;cene augu&s;t; when the river is increa&s;ed by heavy rains, it breaks down two channels, that to the north being &s;helvy, throws the water into &s;heets of foam; the other being perpendicular, it falls there in one va&s;t &s;pout, from the precipice, eighty-two perpendicular feet, into a deep ba&s;on, at once ca&s;ting forth a prodigious &s;pray, that receives the colours of the rainbow, and &s;tunning the ear with the hollow noi&s;e: the rocks form a wide amphitheatre, and being almo&s;t perpendicular, &s;hut up the &s;cene with a &s;olemnity and maje&s;ty, not to be expre&s;&s;ed: the &s;lopes are decorated with hanging woods, the fi&s;&s;ures and openings of the cliffs, with creeping &s;hrubs; and ancient yew trees, here and there &s;catter their &s;olemn green over the grey rocks, or &s;u&s;pend their ru&s;ty branches from the precipices. Various openings and grottoes are formed by the fanta&s;tic hand of Nature along the northern &s;hore, over which the hanging trees form a verdant canopy; in tho&s;e rece&s;&s;es, parties of plea&s;ure often dine, and mix their wine with the living fountain, that trills down the rock;&mdash;a delightful &s;cene for beauty, &s;ong, and wine!</P>
<P>Whoever would &s;eek for wild and beautiful land&s;cape, &s;hould trace this river to its &s;ource; it mu&s;t &s;uffice in this work, to point out to the reader one more &s;cene on its channel.

The grandeur of this &s;cene baffles de&s;cription; it is not to be expre&s;&s;ed in any miniature drawing; the augu&s;t beauties mu&s;t be imagined by the reader, accompanied with the idea, that here a large and powerful river is hurried down from &s;teep to &s;teep, for more than two hundred yards, da&s;hed and di&s;tracted by oppo&s;ing rocks, in various directions, and re&s;ounding from the lofty &s;hores, that tremble on their thou&s;and columns. Over the deepe&s;t and mo&s;t awful part of the gulph, but where the rocks approach neare&s;t to each other, a bridge is laid, formed of one piece of timber, without any rail; where only pa&s;&s;engers, who have a brain befitted to aerial flight, may go without horror: the length of the
<PB N="281" REF="349">beam appears to be upwards of forty feet from buttre&s;s to buttre&s;s. It would be tedious to de&s;cribe every beautiful &s;cene that is found on the banks of this river from hence to its &s;ource; rocks, ca&s;cades, and wild &s;hores, follow its cour&s;e, to the foot of the mountain of Cro&s;s-fell, where the fir&s;t apparent &s;pring flows; in who&s;e environs, in the deep gullies, &s;now has lain undi&s;&s;olved for many years; as we proved by many &s;trata of herbs and &s;oil, which appeared in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion as deep as we could penetrate.</P>
<P>The country immediately above Middleton ri&s;es gradually; on the &s;kirts of the hills, for four miles, there are &s;cattered inclo&s;ures, and pretty good lands, of a &s;outhern a&s;pect. Newbiggin is the la&s;t village northward&mdash;beyond the Tees force, the hills ri&s;e very &s;wiftly, and there is not a tree to be &s;een; Nature here is not barren, but neglected; by planting and inclo&s;ing, great improvements might be made in the lands; whenever the noble proprietor &s;hall turn his mind to this di&s;trict, by planting only, immen&s;e advantage would accrue to future ages. The barrene&s;t heights pour forth hidden trea&s;ures, being rich in mines. In 1781, from the various mines in this di&s;trict, there was brought to the mills to be &s;melted, 5617 bings of ore; four bings and a half, upon an average, will produce a fother of lead, weighing 22 cwt.&mdash;Each fother yields ten ounces of &s;ilver; and about three pounds per fother will win and manufacture the ore, and carry the lead to market; it &s;old that year for 17 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> a fother. Egle&s;ton lord&s;hip that year produced about &s;ixty bings of ore.&mdash;The riche&s;t product of &s;ilver is from Claregill-head mine, in Cumberland, the lead of which yields 42 ounces to the fother.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The author had the&s;e notes from Mr. Lancelot Harri&s;on, lately decea&s;ed, who brought the &s;hot-ca&s;ting art in this country to very high perfection.</NOTE></P>
<P>The cattle and &s;heep of this part of the country are &s;mall, the cattle are fed to little more than ten &s;tone per quarter; ewes bred in the dale, when fat, weigh from &s;even to ten pounds per quarter; and wedders from ten to &s;ixteen pounds a quarter: &s;ome in the lower grounds are heavier. This country abounds in &s;heep; no le&s;s than 20,000 are &s;aid to be depa&s;tured on the common lands yearly. Six fleeces of wool generally go to the &s;tone. The vale is well peopled, on account of the great number of men employed in the mines, who, notwith&s;tanding their labour, are &s;trong limbed and &s;tately, approaching to &s;ix feet in height.</P>
<P>On each &s;ide of the river, the moors abound with game, and the &s;treams are every where filled with trout: &s;uch are the compen&s;ations bountiful Nature has yielded for her le&s;s &s;eemly exterior countenance.</P>

<P>THE pa&s;&s;age from Tee&s;dale into Weardale is difficult, even in the height of &s;ummer; the hills are &s;teep, the &s;ettles or &s;lacks are mo&s;&s;y and full of dan|gerous bogs; and the road is pointed out to travellers, by pillars and heaps of &s;tones, placed on eminences. In the wor&s;t, or mo&s;t difficult part of the way, you pa&s;s the workings of lead mines, at a place called Pike-Law, which, it is &s;aid, produced to the fir&s;t Earl of Darlington, not le&s;s than 10,000 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> a-year, for &s;everal &s;ucce&s;&s;ive years: at the &s;econd pillar, or heap of &s;tones, you obtain a &s;ight of Weardale, a narrow vale, pent in by bleak and lofty mountains, but yet chearing to the eye, long wearied in the precarious paths of the a&s;cent. There are a few hou&s;es in the depth of the vale, with a chapel of ea&s;e to Stanhope; the inclo&s;ed lands let for near 40 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> an acre; the farms are &s;mall, divided into lots of about 10 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> a-year, with exten&s;ive common right; the lower commons bear a &s;ine &s;hort herbage; the higher hills are not &s;o heathy and barren as in the head of Tee&s;dale; and the cattle and &s;heep are of a &s;uperior breed.</P>

<PB N="293" REF="359">&s;teps to the nave, 28 feet; is hand&s;omely wain&s;coted and &s;creened with oak, having &s;ix &s;talls on the north and &s;outh, and two &s;talls on each &s;ide of the &s;creen-gates. It is lighted by a large window to the ea&s;t, and two to the &s;outh, under pointed arches. There hath formerly been fine painted gla&s;s in the chancel windows, of which there remain &s;everal fragments of excellent figures, with labels containing their names; the word Zacharias is perfect. There is a large &s;quare porch to the north, now filled with &s;eats. The nave is regular, con&s;i&s;ting of a centre and two &s;ide ailes, formed by rows of three round columns, &s;upporting circular arches, and lighted by three large windows, north and &s;outh; and two &s;mall ones towards the tower. The nave is in length, 50 feet; and, including the &s;ide ailes, in width 40 feet, regularly &s;talled with oak.</P>
<P>The rectory hou&s;e is a hand&s;ome building, erected by Dr. Hartwell, in the year 1697, as appears by an in&s;cription, placed on the ea&s;t end.<NOTE N="&para;" PLACE="foot">W. H. D. D. R S. EXTRVXIT ANNO PACIS EVANGELII 1597. RYSW. ICI. Io.</NOTE> In the garden, a
<PB N="294" REF="360">Roman altar is pre&s;erved, found about 50 years ago, on Bollihope common in this pari&s;h; the in&s;cription runs thus: Silvano invicto &s;acrum C.

Is it po&s;&s;ible a boar was &s;uch excellent game, that an altar &s;hould be rai&s;ed in comme|moration of the conque&s;t; it is more probable, and more ju&s;t to the character of a leader of Roman cavalry, to pre&s;ume, &s;ome enemy of greater con&s;equence was typified by the figure of the boar. In all the Scotch excur&s;ions, we find that figure cut on the monuments, to di&s;tingui&s;h the northern people; and the &s;itua|tion of the altar encourages the idea.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See an account of this in&s;cription, Gent.

<P>We have already &s;een what was the cu&s;tomary tenure of lands, in the year 1595, but mu&s;t have reference to the more antient records, to di&s;cover the &s;ervility of the original tenures. By the Bolden Buke, it appears there were xx villains in Stanhope, who, each held one oxgang of land, rendering 2 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> with 16 days works of one man, between Penteco&s;t and Martinmas; each villain led the Lord's corn four days, with one carriage, and made four portions of &s;eed land; mowed two days, when he received a corrody, and made and led the hay, having a loaf on leading days, as well for corn as hay; carried and re-carried, between Stanhope and Wol&s;ingham; and carried the game killed in the fore&s;t to Durham and Auck|land. Moreover, at the great hunt, they erected for the entertainment of the prelate and his &s;uit, a kitchen, larder, and other offices (Canillum, perhaps a dog kennel) and prepared beds or couches for the hall, chapel and chamber; and brought all the provi&s;ions for the lodge. Various per&s;ons held portions of land on le&s;s &s;ervile tenure, and &s;ome for an annual out-rent. The &s;ons of Gamellus de Rogerley, and others, held lands by the &s;ervice of providing a man forty days, in the fore&s;t at fawning time, and the like at rutting time; and going on me&s;&s;ages: others prepared the &s;eed land in autumn. Aldredus the Smith had 12 acres at 3 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> rent, and others on various duties. Lambertus the Marble Cutter had thirty acres of land for his &s;tipend, whil&s;t he wrought in the bi&s;hop's &s;ervice. William Wilde, as headborough man, held a toft, a croft, and &s;even acres of land &s;on his &s;ervice. All the tenants and villains repaired the mill-dam, and brought the mill|&s;tones. The Punder had &s;ix acres of land, and the cu&s;tomary &s;heafs of corn, and rendered 40 hens and 400 eggs. In Bi&s;hop Hatfield's Survey, we find &s;undry lands &s;pecified by name, with the owners, under the title of free tenants. The Bi&s;hop's Almoner held 100 acres of land in Rookup at 2 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> rent. Newland&s;ide was held by Will. Merley, at 6 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> 9 <ABBR>d.</ABBR> rent, and Huckleyfield at 2 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> rent.&mdash;Roger de Dirlton, Bolyope&s;hele, at 6 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> 8 <ABBR>d.</ABBR> rent.&mdash;Robert Todd, Hor&s;eleyburn-field, at 12 <ABBR>d</ABBR> rent.&mdash;Richard Dowy, Moreland, at 3 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> rent.&mdash;Thomas Mar&s;hall, Harlaugh, at 12 <ABBR>d</ABBR> rent.&mdash;Thomas Rogerley, Newfield, at 6 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> 8 <ABBR>d.</ABBR> rent.&mdash;John de Merley, Jo&s;yanbanks at 2 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> 3 <ABBR>d.</ABBR> rent.&mdash;John Blackhead, Wodcroft, at 13 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> 4 <ABBR>d.</ABBR> rent.&mdash;Will.

<P>Before we take a view of the wider parts of the vale, it is nece&s;&s;ary to ob&s;erve, that the &s;hores of the river and brooks furni&s;h fine meadow grounds; there is &s;ome tillage land near Stanhope town, where, in our tour on the 27th of July, wheat was begun to ripen, and oats were full &s;hot; the crops tolerably flu&s;h: cattle about Stanhope feed to near &s;eventy &s;tone weight, &s;heep &s;eventeen pounds a quarter, and fleeces weigh near &s;even pounds: the &s;heep kept upon the commons are much &s;maller. The inhabitants are numerous, robu&s;t, and healthy, in &s;o much, that in this exten&s;ive pari&s;h, the limits of which exceed twenty miles, it has frequently happened there has not been a funeral for eight weeks: five hundred men, not le&s;s than five feet ten inches in height, and many above &s;ix feet high, may be found in this pari&s;h.</P>

<P>This being a manor of the bi&s;hop, the ancient tenure of lands therein was &s;ervile: by the Bolden Buke, it appears that the villains held three hundred acres, rendering nine marks; that they cut and carried all the bi&s;hop's corn within the manor of Wol&s;ingham, with the help of the lord's bondmen; mowed all the meadows of Bradley, won and led the hay; wrought nine &s;core days at the lord's command, carried &s;ix &s;core loads of wood, and prepared the &s;eed land at Brandwood, with all their hou&s;ehold, except hou&s;ewives; prepared four portions of &s;eed land at Wol&s;ingham, when they received a corrody, and when they mowed and carried the hay and corn, they had each a loaf of bread. William Pre&s;byter, and Jacob
<PB N="300" REF="366">his &s;on, held lands, rendering a rent in money; Walter Crok for his lands went the bi&s;hop's me&s;&s;ages, and &s;uperintended the villains at mowing and reaping. Others held on the &s;ame &s;ervice. Roger de Bradley held lands in Bradley by &s;ervice of the fore&s;t forty days in fawning time, and forty days in rutting time, and by fencing and keeping Bradley meadows. Roger de Roangers held under the fore&s;t &s;ervice: Ralph the <HI>Beekeeper</HI> held &s;ix acres for his &s;ervice in tending the bees&mdash;Adam the Headboroughman had &s;ix acres&mdash;Henry the <HI>Shepherd</HI> had twelve acres, the <HI>gardner</HI> had five acres, three coroners had &s;eventeen acres, and rendered 3100 <HI>&s;cutelli;</HI> what this implies it is difficult to determine.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Tres coronatores xvij acras et reddunt M^c.

<P>BRADLEY lies in a fine valley, about a mile ea&s;tward of Wol&s;ingham: it anciently gave name to a re&s;ident family, but before Bi&s;hop Hatfield held the &s;ee, it became part of the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of the Evers of Witton, and, at the time of the prelate's Survey, the vill of Bradley was held by Ralph Euere, as in that record he is written, who rendered for the &s;ame 22 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> He held therewith Sunning&s;ide, containing 200 acres, at 20 <ABBR>s.</ABBR>&mdash;Kitte&s;park and Walkerland at 6 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> rent.

We have no account when this hou&s;e was di&s;|mantled, and the interior parts de&s;troyed: it is now merely a ruin: one would be apt to fix the date of the more modern part of the edifice to the latter end of Queen Elizabeth's reign, from the mode of architecture, u&s;ed in the new erection; but that it bears &s;imilarity to parts of Witton Ca&s;tle, the principal &s;eat of the Evers; and Bi&s;hop Langley's epi&s;copacy, when a licence to embattle was obtained, carries us to King Henry VI.'s time.</P>

<P>Within about three hundred yards of Hare-hope Burn, a &s;mall rivulet which ri&s;es in the adjoining hills to the north-we&s;t, is a &s;ingular piece of antiquity, called by the neighbouring people THE CASTLES. At the foot of a high ridge of hills is an inclo&s;ure, of an oblong figure, the interior &s;pace, an inclining plain, is in length on the &s;outh &s;ide ninety paces, and on the north eighty-three, and is in width &s;eventy paces; it is defended on every &s;ide by a lofty mound or vallum of loo&s;e pebble &s;tones, with an outward ditch; no entrance appears but on one &s;ide, where the &s;tones are &s;o much fallen in, that it is not ea&s;y to form an idea of its original width: at this opening we paced the ba&s;e of the mound, and &s;ound it to exceed fifteen paces, and the medium height of the ridge was upwards of five yards. On the &s;ide where the gate or entrance is, a little &s;tream of water runs down a deep gill or gully, &s;o that nature had rendered that approach more capable of defence; where perhaps a bridge or platform of trees or hurdles, ea&s;ily removed or de&s;troyed, was u&s;ed; large oaks and birch trees now grow among the pebbles of the mound; and what is mo&s;t remarkable, juniper trees are come to a va&s;t &s;trength and &s;tature upon it; &s;uch as we have not &s;een in any other part of the county: the ditches are grown full of bru&s;hwood: from the gill or gully the mound looks &s;tupendous, as there it has required the greate&s;t quantity of materials to bring the ridge to the common level of the re&s;t of the work. Whence the pebbles were collected (as the adjacent lands do not &s;eem to furni&s;h &s;uch materials) is not ea&s;y to conjecture. The interior &s;pace appears to have been ploughed in modern times.&mdash;The ca&s;tles lie in the e&s;tate of John Leaton, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> and look upon Hoppiland. It is improbable, from the nature of the adjoining lands, that this work was made for a temporary camp, or in modern times, or even &s;ince the country was cleared of wood; as it is &s;o &s;ituated that all the &s;urrounding lands overlook it; and an enemy would have had many advantages in a&s;&s;ailing and annoying the garri&s;on with mi&s;&s;ile weapons from the eminences: we pre&s;ume it was con&s;tructed in very remote antiquity. The Roman writers tell us, that Cae&s;ar &s;ound the inhabitants of this i&s;land dwelling in huts in the mid&s;t of thick woods and fore&s;ts; in &s;trongholds concealed among the mountains: the whole country adjoining <HI>The Ca&s;tles,</HI> was a fore&s;t, and it is but a &s;ew years &s;ince the lands were cultivated: this place &s;eems to an&s;wer in every particular to the de&s;criptions of the old Briti&s;h &s;trongholds; &s;urrounded with a mound of pebbles, without any cement; in a concealed and &s;ecure retreat, covered by hills, and embowered with a thick wood. The place under &s;uch circum&s;tances was impregnable: the more di&s;tant approach, we may conclude, was through a wood, where, perhaps, one man only at a time could pa&s;s, as in the wilds of America; the nearer pa&s;&s;es, it is pre|&s;umed, would be blockaded by timber trees, felled and piled together in an irregular

At the time we viewed this &s;tronghold, no one could climb the mound, without much danger and fatigue. The interior plain is capable of receiving five hundred huts, as we computed; &s;o that the fort, if it may be &s;o termed, would &s;ecure within the vallum, between two and three thou&s;and people, calculating five to a hut, or thereabout.</P>

<P>Leland in his Itinerary, vol. I. p. 80, &s;ays&mdash; <Q>From Binche&s;ter to Braun&s;peth &startq;4 miles, al by mountaine ground, as is about Akeland, and not fertile of corn, but welle wodid." "As I came by a mile and more to Bran&s;peth, I pa&s;&s;id by a ford over Were ryver. The village and ca&s;telle of Bran&s;peth &s;tondith on a &endq;rokky among hills higher than it.</Q> Many conjectures have been made touch|ing the derivation of the name, and &s;ome have given credit to a tradition, that a wild boar haunted the woods of the&s;e parts, and made the lofty hill above Brance|peth his den, from thence called Brawnden; that from his awful track or pa&s;&s;age being here, the name of Brawns-path was derived; to reconcile this tradition, it has been &s;aid, that the cognizance or arms of Richard of Glouce&s;ter was a boar pa&s;&s;ant, and in contempt of his memory, this place had that appellation, from being his habitation: but &s;uch conjectures vani&s;h, when we find in records, above a century prior to the time of Richard, that the place bore the &s;ame name. The
<PB N="312" REF="383">church is dedicated to St. Brandon;<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">St. Brandon was Abbot of Clonfert, in Ireland.&mdash;<HI>Vid.

<P>The village of Brancepeth &s;tands about a mile to the we&s;t of the river Wear: the ca&s;tle is on the &s;outh of the town, which all authors agree was built by one of the Bulmers, a family of great reputation, and &s;eated here for many generations, but from what early period, we have no information. It has been &s;trongly for|tified, and defended by a cantonment of towers: Leland in his Itin. vol. I. p. 62. 71, &amp;c. &s;ays&mdash; <Q>Strongly &s;et and buildid, and hath 2 courtes of high building.&mdash; &startq;There is a little mote that hemmith a great piece of the fir&s;t court.&mdash;In this court be 3 towers of logging, and three &s;maule adornaments.&mdash;The plea&s;ure of the ca&s;telle is in the 2 court, and entering into it by a great toure, I &s;aw in &s;chochin, in the fronte of it a lion rampaunt.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gules, billette, or; and a lion rampant of the &s;econd are the Bulmers arms.&mdash;The cre&s;t a bull pa&s;&s;ant.</NOTE> On the &s;outhe we&s;t part of the ca&s;telle cummith doune a little bek out o'the rokkes and hilles not far of."&mdash; Sum &s;ay that Rafe Nevile, the fir&s;t Erle of We&s;tmerland, buildid much of this &endq;hou&s;e, A. D. 1398.</Q> The Erle that now is hath &s;et a new peace of work to it." Within the works is a &s;pacious area, which you enter from the north by a gate with a portcullis, and defended by two &s;quare towers. The area is of no regular figure, and the works which &s;urround it, though very &s;trong, have no di&s;tingui&s;hing marks, by which a conjecture can be formed as to their age: the parts now inha|bited lie on the &s;outh-we&s;t &s;ide of the area, and appear to have been connected by works of various ages; the original plan in that part &s;eems to have con&s;i&s;ted of four di&s;tinct &s;quare towers, who&s;e angles project as buttre&s;&s;es, with a &s;mall turret at the top of each angle, hanging on corbles, open at the &s;ides, and not in front. From the gate, on the ea&s;t &s;ide, is a long &s;tretch of wall, with a parapet, which communicates with a large &s;quare tower, having projecting angles, turreted like tho&s;e de&s;cribed; from this tower the wall communicates, at no great di&s;tance, with another large tower &s;imilar to the la&s;t, and thence the wall &s;tretches to the inhabited part of the ca&s;tle, broken only by a &s;mall turret, &s;quare in front, but octagonal towards the court: from the gate on the we&s;t is a high wall, the parapet in many parts hangs on corbles; where the wall forms angles, it is garni&s;hed with &s;mall &s;quare turrets, on the area &s;ide &s;upported by an arch; and in the floor of each is a &s;quare aperture to receive materials from per&s;ons below, whereby the guard &s;hould annoy tho&s;e who a&s;&s;ailed the wall. Towards the north and ea&s;t the ca&s;tle has been defended by a moat; to the &s;outh and we&s;t the walls ri&s;e from a rock, nearly forty feet in height, watered by a &s;mall brook. The hills to the we&s;t are lofty. It is probable the whole fortre&s;s con&s;i&s;ted originally of a race or &s;cries of towers, of &s;imilar form; for the we&s;t wall and angular turrets are much more modern than the fortifications on the ea&s;t. If this conjecture is allowed,
<PB N="313" REF="384">then the fortre&s;s would contain a cantonment of eight large towers, exclu&s;ive of tho&s;e defending the gateway. One matter, which &s;eems nece&s;&s;ary to ob&s;erve, points out the great antiquity of this ca&s;tle, that our records furni&s;h us with no licence for fortifying and embattling; which is not the ca&s;e of any other in the county, except Barnard Ca&s;tle: and &s;o early as the 27th year of Bi&s;hop Hatfield, it is &s;tiled in the records the barony of Brancepeth.<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Vide Horden.</NOTE> On failure of i&s;&s;ue male in Bertram Bulmer,<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><Q><P>A &s;ketillus Bulmer had a &s;on cauillid Bertram, and they were Lords of Bran&s;peth, Berthram had a daughter and heire married to the heire of the Nevilles, and &s;o cam Bran&s;peth to the Nevilles.</P>

As to this earl's failing in i&s;&s;ue male, it appears to be an error; to refute which, we beg leave to refer the reader to what
<PB N="317" REF="388">is &s;aid under Staindrop. There is a large porch to the &s;outh of the chancel, opened by an arch, ca&s;ed with wood, and ornamented with &s;hields of arms: a table monument below, without an in&s;cription: the dexter arms of Nevills, the &s;ini&s;ter, argent, three boars heads &s;able: Leland in the Itinerary, &s;ays&mdash; <Q>There lyith in &startq;that chapelle on the &s;outh &s;ide of the quier a Countes of We&s;tmerland, &s;i&s;ter to &endq;Bouth, Archbi&s;hop of York.</Q> She was wife to Ralph, the third Earl of We&s;tmorland.

<P>LEL. ITIN.

The nave is twenty paces in length, with &s;ide ailes, each formed by two octagonal pillars, long light &s;hafts, &s;upporting pointed arches; the ceiling is wood, and one of the rafters on the north &s;ide is ornamented with a carved figure of a bull bearing a &s;hield, with the arms of Nevill on the left &s;houlder.&mdash;The &s;talls are of oak, regular, and ornamented with <HI>fleurs de lis:</HI> it is lighted with two old flat arched windows to the north, and three modern windows to the &s;outh: the upper windows are &s;quare and regular, four on each &s;ide. The cro&s;s is lighted at each end; the windows under pointed arches. At the north end of the cro&s;s, lies a colo&s;&s;ian &s;tone recumbent effigy, finely cut, in a coat of mail, and hood of chain-work, the hands elevated, a &s;hield on the left arm, the legs cro&s;&s;ed, the right leg uppermo&s;t, the feet re&s;ted upon a lion: a muzzled bear lies by his left &s;ide, and the cu&s;hion which &s;upports his head is re&s;ted on a group or clu&s;ter of lions: the bearings of the &s;hield are the arms of Nevill, with a file of five flambeaux, &s;ome modern heralds call the file a label. In ancient authors, and particularly in the book entitled The Accedence of Armorie, it is &s;aid this di&s;tinction was for the
<PB N="318" REF="389">heir of the family, dying in the life time of the grandfather. From this circum|&s;tance, it is probable this was the monument of one of the Roberts de Nevill.</P>
<P>There were two chauntries in this church, one dedicated to St. John, of which we know no more, than that Browne Willis &s;et forth the names of Henry Statch|lock and William Cutory, who had pen&s;ions of 30 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> each in the year 1553.&mdash;Bi&s;hop Dudley granted his licence,<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Rot.

<P>HALYWELL lies to the ea&s;t of Brancepeth, the &s;eat of the family of Reeds, in a fine &s;eque&s;tered &s;ituation, &s;urrounded with excellent lands. The fir&s;t notice we have of this manor, is in the time of Bi&s;hop Hatfield, when John Randolf died &s;eized of <Q>the manor of Halywell, in the vill of Brancepeth, held of Ralph de &startq;Neville, Chiv. by fealty and 4 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> rent: al&s;o the manor of Ea&s;t Brandon, with lands in Pre&s;ton on Skerne, held of the Lord Ralph de Neville by half a knight's &endq;fee.</Q> In John, the male line of that ancient family cea&s;ed, and he left three daughters coheire&s;&s;es, Margaret the wife of William Hee, Johan the wife of William de Elmedon, and Agnes the wife of John Fo&s;&s;our.<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Inq. p. m. an. 17 Hatf. ap.

<P>It doth not appear that STOCKLEY was ever &s;evered from the chief manor of Brancepeth, it being part of the e&s;tate forfeited by the Earl of We&s;tmorland.</P>
<P>WILLINGTON lies &s;outh of Brancepeth, a &s;mall village, which in the time of Cutheard, &s;econd Bi&s;hop of Che&s;ter, was given by Barnard, a prie&s;t, to St. Cuthbert, that he might be admitted one of the fraternity of Durham mona&s;tery. Here Henry Mills, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> has a plea&s;ant &s;eat. The family of Bowes had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions here, but they were &s;oon united with the lare e&s;tates of the Nevills, and pa&s;&s;ed there|with in the attainder. The ve&s;tigia of the Watling-&s;treet or Roman road, which leads from Binche&s;ter to Lanche&s;ter, are di&s;tinctly to be traced about half a mile
<PB N="319" REF="390">to the we&s;tward of Willington. A large column was lately dug up, with an in|&s;cription thereon; but before a drawing could be obtained, it was &s;quared down and defaced, to make the pillar of a &s;hed for cattle.</P>
<P>THE ROMAN ROAD, &amp;c. Pa&s;&s;ed through this village. The fir&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of this manor we find named in the records, were Birdons; Roger de Birdon held the &s;ame in capite of the bi&s;hop, by homage, fealty, and ten &s;hillings rent at the exchequer, and died &s;eized there|of, leaving John, his &s;on and heir, as appears by an inqui&s;ition taken in the 12th year of Bi&s;hop Hatfield.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Inq. p. m. ap.

<P>CROOK and BILLY-ROW lie to the we&s;t of Brancepeth town, and in the book of rates are joined with Stanley. They were ancient members of Brancepeth, and in the inqui&s;itions taken on the death of Ralph, Earl of We&s;tmorland, we find a di&s;tinction, "of the fore&s;t of Crook with Brancepeth."</P>
<P>EAST AND WEST BRANDON al&s;o appear in the inqui&s;itions, po&s;t mortem, of the Earls of We&s;tmorland.

If this was erected for a beacon, it is a mo&s;t con&s;picuous &s;tation; if it covers &s;ome hero who fell in battle, it denotes the re&s;ting place of a per&s;on of high di&s;tincton, from its magnitude. A &s;earch for etymologies often lead into vague conceits; &s;ome have conceived the name of Brandon is a corruption of Bury-Dane; but the dedication before-mentioned, perhaps, removes every other more ingenious explication.</P>
<P>BURNEGILL, or as it is wrote in the ancient records, BURNING-H$LL, certainly took its name from the gill or valley, through which the river Browne runs, over|looked
<PB N="320" REF="391">by the hill, the &s;ite of this place. It lies at the extremity of this pari&s;h to the ea&s;t, at the confluence of Browne with the Wear. The re&s;ident family a&s;&s;um|ed the local name; in Bi&s;hop Skirlaw's time, it appears by an inqui&s;ition, taken on the death of Hugh de Burninghill, that he died &s;eized of "the vill of Burnynghill, "held of Ralph, Earl of We&s;tmorland, as of his manor of Brancepeth." In 1614, &s;pecial livery of this manor was granted to Richard Hedworth, &s;on and heir of John Hedworth, as being held of the king, by rea&s;on of the attainder of the Earl of We&s;tmorland, and of the manor of Brancepeth.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Rudd's MSS. 5th Jan. 1614.</NOTE></P>
<P>LITTLEBURN lies to the north of Burnegill, and was anciently the &s;eat of the Calverleys; was, in modern times, part of the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of the Doubledays, and now belongs to the family of Reeds.</P>
<P>LANGLEY, or as it is called in the records, LANDLEY, lies &s;till more northward, on the banks of Browne; the only record we find of this place, is a grant inrolled in the time of Bi&s;hop Tun&s;tall, from Richard&s;on to Baxter, wherein it is de&s;cribed to lie within the barony of Brancepeth.<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot"><Q>&startq;Hugo Dei gra.

Bi&s;hop Pud&s;ey afterwards, having received a &s;urrender of the premi&s;es from the chamberlain, in order that the&s;e e&s;tates might be granted to Walter de Cadoma, and Robert, the &s;on of Roger, his nephews, grants the &s;ame to them under four marcs rent, di&s;charged of all other than the free &s;ervice of one twen|tieth part of a knight's fee. In this grant, the chamberlain is &s;tiled "Nepotibus "dilecti filij et familiaris no&s;tri Simonis Camerarij pro &s;ervicio, &amp;c." This grant received the confirmation of Bi&s;hop Philip de Poictue, and the two in&s;truments were ratified by King John, under the great &s;eal, dated 26th of March, in the fir&s;t year of his reign. By &s;everal conveyances in the 14th century, it appears, that Corn&s;ey, under the di&s;tinction of Corn&s;ey-row, gave a local name to its po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or,

<P>By the Bolden Buke, it appears that Thomas de Acley, held this manor by the &s;ervice of a quarter part of a knight's fee. The re&s;ident family &s;oon afterwards a&s;&s;umed the local name of Whytworth; for in the &s;econd year of Bi&s;hop Bury,

<P>On a lofty &s;ituation to the &s;outh-ea&s;t is Merrington, a long irregular village, lying on the ridge of a hill. On the north &s;ide of the town, in a very &s;pacious and open yard, &s;tands the church. Merrington was one of the places granted by William de Carilepho to his mona&s;tery of Durham. In Cumin's u&s;urpation of the &s;ee, his nephew &s;eized the tower of this church, filled it with armed men, and &s;et about to fortify it with a vallum and ditch; this is the fir&s;t account we have of the place. The church &s;hews many marks of antiquity. The tower, like that of Jarrow, has &s;tood in the centre of four ailes, forming a cro&s;s. The chancel is four paces in width, and five paces within the rails; in the centre of which &s;pace, the communion table &s;tands, open on all &s;ides; the a&s;cent is by three &s;teps: from the rails, the chancel is nine paces in length, neatly wain&s;coted in pannels, &amp;c. &s;talled with oak on each &s;ide, with an open cut &s;creen: the ea&s;t window of three lights, is under a circular arch; one, of three windows to the &s;outh, is now walled up; the arches are pointed: there are no lights to the north. The nave is entered from the chancel by a narrow circular arch. The whole length of the nave, from the &s;creen of the chancel to the we&s;t end, is 26 paces, of which the tower takes up nine; but the arches being open under the tower, that part is &s;talled and forms part of the pre&s;ent &s;pace allotted for the congregation. The we&s;t &s;ide of the tower ri&s;es on a heavy circular arch, &s;upported on buttre&s;&s;es; the ea&s;t &s;ide al&s;o ri&s;es on a circular arch, but it &s;prings from clu&s;tered pillars, capitalled in the an|cient and mo&s;t rude Saxon form. The body of the church is lighted by one window to the north, under a pointed arch, and another to the &s;outh under a circular arch, with an ea&s;t light: A large porch, called Lawrence's porch, opens to the middle aile by a pointed arch, near 24 feet in &s;pan; we could obtain no information why the name of Lawrence was given to this porch, nor could we di&s;cover any monu|ment, or other matter, to lead to it.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Perhaps the name is modern.

The pro&s;pect from Merrington church, is at once wonderfully exten&s;ive
<PB N="327" REF="398">and beautiful. The hill on which this edifice &s;tands, is a ridge or long mount, pointing ea&s;t and we&s;t, and ri&s;ing with a gradual a&s;cent from the north and &s;outh, &s;o as to command the fine&s;t land&s;capes within the county of Durham, expanded to the eye in a kind of bird-eye view, by rea&s;on of the loftine&s;s of the mount. The ea&s;tern end of the ridge, having its termination near to hills of almo&s;t equal emi|nence, of cour&s;e affords but a &s;hort pro&s;pect; the we&s;tern termination is at the village of We&s;terton, di&s;tant about a mile; the valley, through which runs the river Wear, lies open to the view, graced with the elegant &s;cenes near Bi&s;hop Auckland, extended up to Witton, and along the winding pa&s;&s;age of the river, almo&s;t as far as Wol&s;ingham. To the right you &s;ee Brancepeth ca&s;tle and its en|virons; to the left, the land&s;cape is bounded by the di&s;tant eminence of Cockfield-fell above Raby. To the north, in the bo&s;om of the vale, with maje&s;tic a&s;pect, lies the city of Durham, on her &s;even hills, graced with a variety of woodlands; on every &s;ide of the city, villages, &s;eat-hou&s;es, and hamlets, are &s;cattered, and the &s;cene is terminated by the mounts of Pen&s;haw and Wardenlaw, which make an elegant break on the horizontal line. To the &s;outh-we&s;t, the York&s;hire hills above Barningham, form the horizon, &s;outhward of which is the &s;pacious plain, where|in Northallerton and Thir&s;k lie; and with a gla&s;s, it is &s;aid, Crake ca&s;tle and York min&s;ter are di&s;coverable; Hamilto$ and Cleveland hills extend ea&s;tward, &s;tretching their cultivated &s;kirts into the vale of Tees; the pike of Roy&s;bury, all the chain of mountains to Hun&s;cliff, and the environs of Flamborough-head are &s;een, with the Tees mouth, and a wide expan&s;e of &s;ea; on the nearer ground, you view di&s;tinctly Sedgefield, Hardwick, and the &s;weep of country to Elwick and the beacon: then the pro&s;pect narrows as you turn northward, and to the left of Quarrington hills, you &s;ee Ellermore, Pittington, Sherburn, and many other objects which are beautifully di&s;po&s;ed in the valley.</P>
<P>Merrington being parcel of the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of the priory of Durham, there is little relative to it in the bi&s;hop's records.</P>

<HEAD>THE PARISH OF ST. ANDREWS AUCKLAND.</HEAD>
<P>WE now enter the exten&s;ive pari&s;h of St. Andrews Auckland, being the la&s;t to be treated of within the limits of the rivers Tyne and Tees.</P>
<P>The church of St. Andrews is &s;ituate on the banks of the river Gaunle&s;s, on a fine ri&s;ing ground, in the mid&s;t of a narrow valley; di&s;tant from the town of Bi&s;hop, or North Auckland, about a mile. This edifice is in the form of a cro&s;s, with a tower at the we&s;t end. The chancel is in width &s;even paces, and in length &s;eventeen paces, neatly fini&s;hed with oak, having fourteen &s;eats or &s;talls on each &s;ide; in the &s;outh wall, by the altar, are three niches for officiating prie&s;ts. The chancel is lighted by &s;ix irregular windows to the &s;outh, and three to the north; the ea&s;t window is of five compartments under a pointed arch: by the fragments of coloured gla&s;s, it &s;eems the windows were formerly highly deco|rated; paintings of our Saviour's &s;uffering's &s;till remain in the north windows.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The&s;e have lately been removed, and the windows glazed with plain gla&s;s.</NOTE> It is &s;eparated from the cro&s;s aile by a fine pointed arch, with elegant mouldings, ri&s;ing from brackets.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">MONUMENTAL INSCRIPTIONS.

<Q><L>"Belly&s;ys Bely&s;ys dafe was thy &s;owell,</L>

This is now called Kennet's Porch. The &s;outh limb of the cro&s;s is lighted by three windows, one at the end, and two to the ea&s;t, all con&s;i&s;ting of three compart|ments, and under pointed arches: under the &s;outh window is a nich, with water ba&s;ons. The nave is uniform, having two &s;ide ailes, formed by rows of four pillars, the fir&s;t and third clu&s;tered, the intermediate ones octagonal, &s;upporting pointed arches, light and elegant; the nave is in length thirty-four paces, and near twenty paces in width, regularly &s;talled with oak, and kept in good order. It is lighted by three large windows in the &s;outh aile, and two in the north; &s;ix windows in the upper range to the &s;outh, and five to the north: the tower ri&s;es on a pointed arch, &s;pringing from pila&s;ters. There is a large gallery at the we&s;t end. In the church are two e&s;&s;igies, one in &s;tone of a female, with a &s;quare head dre&s;s, &s;uppo&s;ed to be one of the Bella&s;ys; the monument is cut in that kind of &s;oft lime&s;tone which is got in the &s;ea banks of Hartlepool, and works like chalk immediately after being brought from the bed, but hardens with time equal to marble; the other is &s;aid to be the monument of one of the Pollards; Mr. Pennant de&s;cribes it <Q>a cro&s;s-legged &startq;knight, armed in mail to his fingers ends, with a &s;kirt, formed of &s;tripes, reach|ing &endq;to his knees; a &s;hort &s;word and conic helm.</Q> The author of the &s;epulchral monuments adds,&mdash;"Is not this the common plated &s;urcoat?" The hood is united with the ve&s;t or wai&s;t and &s;leeves of the mail, and the &s;leeves are continued, and form the mitts or cover for the hands. The figure is of wood, the right leg
<PB N="331" REF="402">is uppermo&s;t; the feet re&s;t on a lion; the hands are elevated; and the &s;word is &s;heathed. The &s;outh porch or entrance has an elegant roof of groined arches, and had three windows, now built up.</P>
<P>Tanner is the Notitia, p. 116, &s;ays&mdash; <Q>This church or chapel of St. Andrew &startq;here was made collegiate, and well endowed by Anthony Beck, Bi&s;hop of &endq;Durham.</Q> Leland (Colect, vol. I. 123) calls him <HI>Primus Fundator,</HI> and he is reckoned founder by other authors in general: but there &s;eems to have been &s;ome foundation here before; for in 1239 Robertus de Courteny habuit literas de pre&s;entatione ad decanatum de Aclent ratione vacationis Epi&s;copatus Dunelm. pat. 24 Hen. III. m. 5. The name of Auckland is derived of the Saxon <HI>Ac</HI> or <HI>Ake, Quercus;</HI> and <HI>Ley, Campus,</HI> the field or place of oaks: this place, in old writings, is &s;pelled Akeland, Aucland, Aclent, Acclat, and Acle. Authors have &s;uppo&s;ed that the prebends of this church, and the churches of Darlington, Ea&s;ington, and Norton, were founded by Bi&s;hop William de Karilepho, by order or a&s;&s;ent of Pope Gregory, for the maintenance of tho&s;e &s;ecular canons only, whom he had di&s;placed from the cathedral church of Durham; Leland's expre&s;&s;ions on this occa&s;ion have been con&s;trued to imply, that they had no &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, and that their prebends or portions in tho&s;e churches expired with them: this may rea&s;onably be &s;uppo&s;ed in &s;ome of the churches, from the total &s;ilence of authors about any prebendaries in Ea&s;ington church in after times: thus we find that Pont|eland church, in Northumberland, was prebendal about the time of the Lincoln taxation, 1291, after which we hear no more of its being collegiate: nor indeed do we hear of any prebendaries in Norton till about the year 1227, or at Darlington, till Hugh Pud&s;ey's time, who was con&s;ecrated Bi&s;hop of Durham, 20th December, 1153. But it is certain there were prebendaries here, before Bi&s;hop Beck's ordonance for con&s;tituting a deanry within this church, and probably they had a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion here from the early period before noted. There is an excellent &s;pirit of piety breathed throughout the prelate's act on this occa&s;ion:&mdash; <Q>We tru&s;t that &startq;our pa&s;toral duty is di&s;charged mo&s;t &s;uitably to the will of God, when our care extends not only to the procuring of temporal emoluments to his church, but al&s;o to the promotion of religion in his people; that while divine &s;ervice is per|formed with greater veneration, a more fervent devotion may be excited in the congregation, and that the holy offices, with the mini&s;ters, may be acknowledged with greater reverence and honour. Seeing therefor that the collegiate church of St. Andrew of Auckland, in our dioce&s;e, is not only greatly decrea&s;ed in the number of its prebendaries, but in revenue al&s;o; and as no canon or prebendary of this church doth either re&s;ide him&s;elf, or find a proper per&s;on to officiate in his &s;tead, though duty and hone&s;ty require it, pretending in excu&s;e, that they have no hou&s;es there, or &s;ufficient grounds whereon to build: We, &amp;c. with the con|&s;ent of ma&s;ter Robert de Alberwyke, Vicar, and of all the canons or prebendaries there, do ORDAIN as followeth:&mdash;As within the limits of the pari&s;h of Auckland, certain new lands of our wa&s;tes have been brought into tillage in our time, whereof the tithes are in our di&s;po&s;al, as well by common right, as the cu&s;tom of the &s;aid pari&s;h, of &s;uch tithes of new or wa&s;te lands &s;o brought into tillage beyond Gaundle&s;s, in our fore&s;t, towards the we&s;t, and near Gaundle&s;s, in Wydcope
<PB N="332" REF="403">Moor, we con&s;titute and ordain a prebend to the amount of ten pounds, con|ceiving that the &s;aid tithes will for ever prove &s;ufficient to an&s;wer the &s;ame: and becau&s;e an union of the prerogative of dignity and eminence of per&s;on with riches con&s;titutes the highe&s;t degree of an excellent office, the name of vicar, which hitherto has been the mo&s;t eminent in this church, we decree &s;hall for ever be changed to that of dean of the collegiate church, therein not only regarding the late vicar, now the dean thereof, and his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, but al&s;o the &endq;advancement of that church to higher honours.</Q> A new prebend was annexed to the deanry, and it was thereby ordained, that the dean and his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors &s;hould receive all obventions, lands, rents, rights, and liberties, which the vicars formerly had. And al&s;o that the dean &s;hould con&s;tantly re&s;ide, and provide a prie&s;t to officiate in the prelate's chapel at Auckland.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Nova ordinac'o cantarie be. M.

In 1572, in the court of Bi&s;hop Booth, William Bela&s;ys levied a fine of the manor of Henknoll, and others, his lands in this county, and by deed inrolled in the court of Chancery at Durham, on the 24th of January, in the 2d year of Bi&s;hop Dudley's pontificate, A. D. 1577, the &s;ame were limited to Thomas his &s;on, and the heirs male of his body; remainder to William, another &s;on, and the heirs male of his body; remainder to Robert, another &s;on, and the heirs male of his body; remainder to Galfrid, another &s;on, and the heirs male of his body; remainder to the right heirs of William the father.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rot.

<P>COUNDON, a &s;mall village, lies to the &s;outh of We&s;terton about half a mile. The Bolden Buke notes this place; that in Little Coundon there were twelve cottagers, who each held &s;ix acres of land, and wrought two days in the week from St. Peter's day to Martinmas, and the re&s;t of the year one day in the week; that each made four portions of land, and rendered a hen and one hundred eggs. The deme&s;ne lands of Great Coundon containing &s;ix carucates of land, with the pa&s;ture and &s;heep were then in the bi&s;hop's hands. In Bi&s;hop Hatfield's Survey, it appears that there were four free tenants, who held five me&s;&s;uages and forty acres of land, rendering three-pence per acre. The deme&s;ne was then let out, one Hopper held a me&s;&s;uage and twenty-three acres and one rood of land, paying 23 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> 4 <ABBR>d.</ABBR> and twelve others held an hundred and &s;eventy acres, at one &s;hilling an acre, and there re|mained eighteen acres in the bi&s;hop's hands. William de Coundon, chaplain, he$$ a cottage and &s;ix acres. It al&s;o appears that there were then &s;eventeen cottages, with ninety-nine acres of land, held by nine cottagers, half a cottage excepted, then wa&s;te, and their &s;ervices were &s;imilar to tho&s;e &s;et forth in the Bolden Buke, &s;ave that the hens are numbered at thirty-&s;ix, and the eggs one thou&s;and eight

There is a valor of the Grange, in which all the plots of ground are mentioned, with the number of acres in each, containing in the whole three hundred and eighty acres. The &s;mall portion of freehold land affords us little matter worthy notice in the remaining records; we find the families of Padecocks and Bracks there; and the Hotons were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of Coundon. The Hoppers were the mo&s;t ancient family re&s;ident here; the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed Howledge, now the &s;eat of the Agnews; but, falling into female i&s;&s;ue, the heire&s;s married one Nichol&s;on, who&s;e only daughter and heire&s;s, Elizabeth, intermarrying with Humphrey Doubleday, of Butterby, carried with her the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of the two families, which centred in her: &s;he &s;urvived her hu&s;band, and &s;old Howledge, now the &s;eat of the Agnews; her i&s;&s;ue &s;till retain con&s;iderable po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions at Coundon. The pro&s;pect from Coundon Grange is exten&s;ive and beautiful, com|manding the valley in which the Aucklands are &s;eated, and a long &s;tretch of the vale of Wear.</P>
<P>To the ea&s;t of Howledge lies WINDLESTON, the man&s;ion of Sir John Eden, Baronet, &s;eated on an ea&s;y inclination of the hill, with an ea&s;tern a&s;pect. This family appears to have been re&s;ident at Windle&s;ton from about the beginning of Queen Elizabeth's reign. In early times, this e&s;tate was divided in many families; part came to the Edens by the &s;ettlement after mentioned; and, by the indu&s;try and attention of the family, other parts were gathered together at various periods. Bi&s;hop Bury gave licence to David de Holgrave, and Ellen his wife, to grant fifteen me&s;&s;uages and fifteen oxgangs of land in Windle&s;ton, to a chaplain for performing daily offices for ever in the church of Bothal, in Northumberland, for the &s;ouls of their parents and ance&s;tors.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rot.

<P>Oppo&s;ite to E&s;comb, on the northern banks of the river, &s;tands NEWTON CAP, the beautiful &s;eat of the family of Bacons, on a &s;ine lofty &s;ituation, commanding a pro&s;pect of the town of Bi&s;hop Auckland, with the bi&s;hop's palace and park, Binche&s;ter, the &s;eat of Farrer Wren, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> and the delightful &s;cenes on the borders of the river Wear. The approach from Bi&s;hop Auckland is by a &s;tone bridge of two eliptical arches, remarkable for its excellent architecture. The accounts we have of this place are very ob&s;cure, by rea&s;on of the number of places in this county of the name of Newton. In the Bolden Buke it is &s;tated, there were thirteen villains in Newton, who&s;e &s;ervices were &s;imilar to tho&s;e of North Auckland. In Bi&s;hop Hatfield's Survcy there are but two incon&s;iderable free tenants named.&mdash; The bond tenants held a common forge, furnace, and kiln, and they rendered for one milch cow at Martinmas 6 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> for aver-pennies 8 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> 8 <ABBR>d.</ABBR> for cornage 20 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> 7 <ABBR>d.</ABBR> and for each oxgang of land a hen at the nativity, and ten eggs at Ea&s;ter, in all thirteen hens and &s;ix &s;core and ten eggs. The exchequer lands let at a certain rent, were very con&s;iderable, con&s;i&s;ting of forty tenements, and &s;eventy-two parcels of land.</P>
<P>To the north lies BIRTLEY, an ancient fore&s;t or park of the bi&s;hops, now inclo|&s;ed and cultivated; of which we have &s;poken in the fir&s;t volume of this work. S$ill more northward lie HUNWICK and HELMEDON; touching the latter there is &s;ome confu&s;ion in the records from the &s;imilarity of the name in the old modes of
<PB N="344" REF="426">writing Homeldon and Elmedon. Hunwick was held anciently by the family of Binche&s;ter, and &s;o is noted in the Bolden Buke. Bi&s;hop Hatfield's Survey notes no &s;ervile tenure; the exchequer lands were held under certain rents. We are not more happy in our &s;earches in the inqui&s;itions, for they only point out to us the names of the per&s;ons who held e&s;tates, but without &s;hewing a regular &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of proprietors. Emma, the widow of Emice de Skoweland, in the 36th of Bi&s;hop Hatfield, died &s;eized of a moiety of the manor of Helmydon, held of the bi&s;hop in capite, by homage, fealty, and 29 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> 6 <ABBR>d.</ABBR> rent. Al&s;o a moiety of eight me&s;&s;uages, and twenty-nine acres of land in Hunwick, held of the Lord of Binche&s;ter. She left a daughter Matilda, of the age of fourteen years, her &s;ole heire&s;s. In Bi&s;hop Skirlaw's time,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Inq. p. m. x Skirlaw.</NOTE> John de Byrden the elder was &s;eized by curte&s;y in right of Alice his wife, daughter of Roger de Byrden, of five me&s;&s;uages, three tofts, and one hundred and twenty-four acres of land in Hunwyk, held of Ralph de Nevill, Earl of We&s;tmorland, by fealty, and 4 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> rent. Al&s;o a me&s;&s;uage, &s;eventy acres of land, and ten of wood, and the &s;ite of a water-mill in Helmedon, held of the bi&s;hop in capite by military &s;ervice. In Bi&s;hop Langley's time the Huttons held many lands at Hunwick, and John Hoton, in the 15th year of that prelate died &s;eized of the vill of Hunwick, with its appurtenances, which, with the manor of Binche&s;ter, he held of the bi&s;hop in capite, by the fourth part of a knight's fee; and in Bi&s;hop Barnes's time we find a record of the homage of Anthony Hutton for Hunwick.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Rudd's MSS.</NOTE> The family of Eures al&s;o po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed lands there; and the Nevills had a con&s;iderable property,<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">2 me&s;&s;. 2 bov. ter. in Hunwick. $ Inq. p. m.

<P>On the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the river Wear, to the ea&s;t, is BYERS and BYERS GREEN. Bi&s;hop Hatfield's Survey conveys no other particular information touching the&s;e places, than that Richard de Park held in Byers Geffrey certain lands; this being under the title of Byer's Green, &s;eems to point out the more ancient name: he is named as the &s;ole free tenant of Byers, where he held one manor-hou&s;e and two carucates of land by foreign &s;ervice, and a rent of 35 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> 2 <ABBR>d.</ABBR> Al&s;o a meadow called Knightfield, formerly John Penreths. The cottagers performed no work, and were under certain rents, as were the tenants of exchequer lands. Byers was part of the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of the Nevills, and in 1430, was included in the bi&s;hop's pardon for alienating without licence;<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Madox's Form. p. 331.</NOTE> which alienation was calculated for the purpo&s;e of making a family &s;ettlement.</P>
<P>Of NEWFIELD and HERMITHEUGH we find nothing remarkable; there hath not come to our notice any circum&s;tances which relate to the manor of the latter place.</P>
<P>Returning towards the &s;outh is BINCHESTER, the manor and &s;eat of Farrer Wren, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> It is a place of great antiquity, and by antiquaries of the fir&s;t character, &s;aid to be the Vinovium of Antoninus, and the Binovium of Ptolemy. Hor&s;ley, &s;peak|ing of Binche&s;ter, &s;ays&mdash; <Q>Ptolemy reckons Binche&s;ter among the con&s;iderable &startq;cities, and calls it<GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, though he has &s;et it a great deal out of its place; the &s;tation has been large, and nearly equal to that at Lanche&s;ter. The river Wear makes a remarkable turn, and &s;o happens to run almo&s;t ea&s;t and we&s;t, and to lie
<PB N="345" REF="427">nearly &s;outh from the &s;tation; though Binche&s;ter be in the general on the &s;outh &s;ide of the river. The out buildings, as u&s;ual, have been between the &s;tation and the river, or to the &s;outh-we&s;t of the &s;tation. Dr. Hunter &s;aid he ob&s;erved a military way going off from Watling-&s;treet near this place, which he &s;uppo&s;ed went to Che&s;ter on the Street: he traced it to Brancepeth park, but could find &endq;it no further.</Q> <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Hor&s;ley's Brit.

<P>"Several Roman antiquities have been found here, as coins called Binche&s;ter pennies, urns and a cornelian. Dr. Hunter is of opinion, that there has al&s;o been a con&s;iderable pottery at this place. He has &s;everal pieces of pots found here, with &s;ome imperfect figures on them, and one piece had AMANDVS (probably the name of the potter) in&s;cribed, which is now in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Earl of Oxford. The following Roman altars have been dug up here.</P>
<P><HI>Deahus Matribus Quintus Lucius Quinti filius Claudia (tribu) Quintianus beneficiarius con&s;ulis votune &s;olvit libens merito.</HI></P>
<P>This is built up in the court wall near the gate, on the right hand as you enter. Camden &s;aw and publi&s;hed it, but not very correctly, nor with the implication of the letters. Dr. Gale has given a more correct copy of it, Anton. Itin. p. 11, from whence it has been in&s;erted in the la&s;t edition of Camden. The only difficulty in the reading, lies in the implication at the end of the &s;econd and beginning of the third line: and the&s;e, by the cour&s;e of the in&s;cription &s;hould expre&s;s the tribe, or the name of the father of this Quintianus, and &s;o I have read it; the third line &s;eems to begin with Fil. connected together, the T at the top of the O (or rather Q) is probably intended for the fir&s;t letter in the &s;econd &s;yllable of Quinti. The name <HI>Quintianus</HI> occurs in another in&s;cription in this county (at Piercebridge) and in the Fa&s;ti Con&s;ulares one <HI>Lucius Ragonius Urinatius Quintianus</HI> was con&s;ul in the year 235. This, I fancy by the note in the margin of Camden, has been &s;uppo&s;ed to be the per&s;on, for beneficiarius is omitted in his copy. There is no doubt but CL in the third line &s;tands for Claudia <HI>(tribu)</HI> which we have upon many in&s;crip|tions in Gruter. And there was an in&s;cription before, among&s;t tho&s;e of Cumberland ju&s;t in this form. <HI>Marcus Cen&s;orius Marci filius voltinia (tribu) Cornelianus.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Matribus &s;acrum Gemellus votum &s;olvit libens merito.</HI>&mdash;This was lying loo&s;e in the kitchen when I &s;aw it: nor do I remember that it has been made public before. It is an altar to the &s;ame Deae Matres, $rected by one Gemellus, or Gaius Emellus, as Mr. Ward conjectures from the name Emellus in Grutter.</P>
<P><HI>Votum &s;olvit libens merito.</HI>&mdash;This is built up in the court wall, but the in&s;cription is effaced, and no letters left upon it, but the four at la&s;t, V. S. L. M.</P>
<P>He then gives the repre&s;entation of two altars, one of which was lying loo&s;e in the yard, and the other built up in the court wall. That which lay loo&s;e has a capital that is &s;omewhat &s;ingular, with a praeferi|culum on one &s;ide, and a patera on the other; that in the wall is more &s;imple and plain. I &s;hould &s;carce (he &s;ays) have given a draught of either, but that I am per&s;uaded on one of them has been the in&s;cription we meet with in Camden, the original whereof I can no where el&s;e di&s;cover, and I think it more probable it has been upon the le&s;&s;er altar, built up in the wall of the court, becau&s;e the plane of this is taller, and &s;o more likely to contain the number of lines, and the other has probably been dug up later; the altars that were di&s;covered before Camden's time, and had any in&s;criptions upon them having been de&s;ignedly built up in the wall of the court. However, as neither of the&s;e at pre&s;ent have any ve&s;tiges of letters upon them, I mu&s;t take the copy of the in&s;cription intirely from Camden, who &s;ays that it was imperfect even in his time, but according to his reading it is as follows:
<Q>...................... TRIB. COHOR. I CARTOV $word$ MARTI VICTORI GENIO LOCI ET BONO EVENTVI.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Tribunus Cobortis primae Cartov $word$ Marti victori Genio loci et bono Eventui.</HI></P>
<P>That the Romans made an imaginary god of Bonus Eventus is certain, and I have &s;ome jealou&s;ly, that in&s;tead of Cartoviorum we &s;hould read Carnoviorum, the Cohors Co$$oviorum is in the Notitia, and was at Pons Aelij."</P>
<P>The military way makes a large $uin here, and di&s;appears a little near the town of Bi&s;hop Auckland, but &s;oon &s;hews it&s;elf again very remarkably by its elevation and ruinous pavement, and conducts us directly to Thornborough near Catteractbridge, where the general agreement of antiquaries, the affinity of name, the plain and vi&s;ible parting of the grand way into two very large and con&s;iderable branches, the &s;ure evidences of a Roman &s;tation and town, with the accurately due di&s;tance on both &s;ides of the &s;ame way, do all concur to render us certain.</P></NOTE></P>
<PB N="346" REF="428">
<P>A letter from John Cade, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> to Dr. Kaye, Dean of Lincoln, given in the Archaeologia, notes Binche&s;ter in the following manner&mdash; <Q>The Vinovium of &startq;Antoninus, and Binovium of Ptolemy, &s;ituated on the &s;tratum called the Fo&s;&s;e|way, was a celebrated Roman city of the Brigantes, and was &s;acred, I apprehend, to Bacchus, and derived its name Vinovium from the fe&s;tivals in&s;tituted there in honour of the deity. Altars and antiquities of various kinds have frequently been found there. Camden takes notice of an altar and in&s;cription to the Deae Matres; and of another to the genius of the place; but the mo&s;t &s;ingular is that of a Priapus, at pre&s;ent in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Farrer Wren, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> the proprietor of the &s;tation. There has likewi&s;e been found another portable altar, exactly &s;imilar to that in the fifteenth plate of Gordon's Itinerarium Septentrionale, but without any in&s;cription; and al&s;o a &s;mall bronze image of that diety, which had probably been a &s;ymbol worn by the Bacchae, or female prie&s;te&s;&s;es, as there is a perforation in its lower parts; or perhaps it may be cla&s;&s;ed among the Lares, &s;imilar to tho&s;e di&s;covered at the Devi&s;es, in Wilt&s;hire, in the year 1714. This celebrated &s;tation contains about twenty-nine acres, and is at pre&s;ent an inexhau&s;tible repo&s;itory of antiquities. Mr. Wren has in his collection &s;ome elegant intaglios found there, with a variety of &s;ilver and copper coins, both of the upper and lower empire, to the time of Valentinian and Theodo&s;ius. Perhaps the Roman pottery at Vinovium has been equal, if not &s;uperior, to mo&s;t in Britain; I have &s;een &s;ome curious fragments of bowls and vazes, enriched with vine branches, and others intire, which appear to have been u&s;ed as &s;acrificing ve&s;&s;els; together with a va&s;t variety of &s;pecimens of different compo&s;itions, &s;ome re&s;emble terra cotta, and &endq;others of gla&s;s.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;There has likewi&s;e been lately dug up a large ba&s;s relief of a Faun, with an altar, but the in&s;cription hitherto illegible. Dr. Spence, in his &s;plendid edition of the Polymetis, &s;tiles the Fauns and Satyres rural dieties attendants on Bacchus, and Calmet, in his learned Dictionary of the Bible, in a print of Heathen idols, gives a bu&s;t of the la&s;civious Pan for Priapus, which is further elucidated by that &s;ingular &s;tatue in the Ludovi&s;ian gardens at Rome, where he is teaching Apollo to play on the &s;hepherd's reed. The ancients feign Priapus to be the &s;on of Bacchus and Venus, and as &s;uch he had divine honours paid him at all the fe&s;ti|vals &endq;of the Bacchanalia, where his image was pre&s;ented to public view.</Q> Mr. Cade then proceeds to conjectures on the names of places which begin with <HI>Vind,</HI> that they were con&s;ecrated to Bacchus.</P>
<P>The &s;tation at Binche&s;ter lies on elevated ground, near eighty perpendicular feet above the river Wear, which wa&s;hes its we&s;tern foot, and by the wa&s;hing of the bank, which con&s;i&s;ts of &s;trata of &s;and and loo&s;e &s;oil, the &s;outh-we&s;t corner of the vallum is gone; the north-we&s;t terminates at Mr. Wren's &s;ummer-hou&s;e.&mdash; The ground within the &s;tation is an inclining plain facing the ea&s;t, and on account of old inclo&s;ures and long cultivation, it is very difficult to a&s;certain the dimen&s;ions
<PB N="347" REF="429">and exact figure. In the break of the bank at the &s;outh-we&s;t corner, the founda|tions of the vallum are laid open, con&s;i&s;ting of very large blocks of &s;tone laid tran&s;ver&s;ly; &s;everal pieces of &s;tone aqueducts are on the &s;ides of the hill, where they have &s;hrunk down with the &s;oil. The elevated &s;ituation affords an exten&s;ive pro&s;pect from the &s;tation; to the &s;outh, Auckland ca&s;tle, the park, and ornamental buildings, are in front; Coundon Grange crowns one eminence, We&s;terton another, and the tower of Bru&s;leton a third; whil&s;t the vale of the Wear is opened to the view for a con&s;iderable extent to the north and &s;outh. Few of the Roman &s;tations every degree, and probably in its environs much &s;heep, cattle, and hor&s;es were bred under the au&s;pices of that diety. To what has been &s;aid of the Roman remains di&s;covered here, we beg leave to add, that Mr. Wren has in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion three &s;eals found at Binche&s;ter, cu$ on coar&s;e cornelians. The fir&s;t was di&s;covered many years ago, the &s;econd in 1767, and the third in 1770. Among the fragments of pottery, there is one impre&s;&s;ed with a man on hor&s;eback, with a human figure pro&s;trate, as if &s;lain, the hor&s;e at full &s;peed; another with the fore parts of a grey|hound in full &s;peed, boldly relieved: the ve&s;&s;els were certainly dedicated to other deities than Bacchus. The coins con&s;i&s;t both of the higher and lower empire, among them one or more of Julius Cae&s;ar, but the chief part are of the lower empire. Some of the urns and lacrymatories are elegant pottery: in the hall is a rude head, like that pre&s;erved at Thirlwall, in Northumberland, &s;everal vazes of a &s;ingular form, and one mutilated figure, with an urn in his arms, which perhaps
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE>
was &s;epulchral. Of the figure in relief, called a Faun by Mr. Cade, by others conjectured to be a Diana Venatrix, we have for the reader's better judgment pre&s;ented a cut from a &s;ketch made by Mr. Surtees, of Mainsforth; and beg leave with others to give our opinion relative to it, that it was the ornament of &s;ome public edifice, carved as a compliment to a chieftain, under whom the light armed troops had gained &s;ingular honours; when we turn our thoughts to the <HI>Fundatores</HI> of the Roman army, we find in all parts of his figure, a &s;imilar expre&s;&s;ion; his bag be|fore him, containing the balls or &s;tones for his &s;ling, is &s;upported on his left arm; his right arm is elevated in the very action of ca&s;ting the &s;ling.</P>

<P>He is in the attitude of approach, and every part of the figure &s;upports this idea. The animal is &s;urely a hare, a common emblem of circum&s;pection and watchful|ne&s;s. The figures of &s;lingers on the ancient monuments are very like this.</P>

<P>Mr. Pennant mentions it thus&mdash; <Q>Bi&s;hop Auckland, a good town, with a large &startq;and &s;quare market-place. On one &s;ide is a hand&s;ome gateway, with a &s;quare tower over it. This is a modern edifice, that built by Bi&s;hop Skirlaw<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lel. Itin.</NOTE> having long &s;ince been de&s;troyed. Through this gateway lies Auckland ca&s;tle, long the re&s;idence of the Bi&s;hops of Durham. It has lo&s;t its ca&s;tellated form, and now re&s;embles &s;ome of the magnificent foreign abbeys. It is an irregular pile, built at different times; but no part is left that can boa&s;t of any great antiquity. Over a bow-window are the arms of Bi&s;hop Tun&s;tal, who died in the beginning of the reign of Queen Elizabeth. This was originally a manor-hou&s;e belonging to the &s;ee, and was fir&s;t enca&s;telled<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE> by Bi&s;hop Beck, who al&s;o built a great hall, and adorned it with marble pillars; he founded a fair chapel, a collegiate church, with a dean and prebends, &amp;c. Excepting the church, there are no reliques of the labours of this prelate; the place having been be&s;towed by the parliament on their furious partizan, Sir Arthur hazelrigg, who, taking a fancy to the place, determined to make it his chief re&s;idence.

The bi&s;hop<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE> pulled it down, and, re&s;toring the materials to their ancient u&s;e, built the pre&s;ent elegant chapel.

The &s;hafts of &s;ome of the marble are &s;ixteen feet high; the length of the chapel is eighty-four feet, the breadth forty-eight, the out&s;ide ornamented with pinnacles. On the floor a plain &s;tone, with a mode&s;t epitaph, informs us, that the pious refounder lies beneath, dying the year 1671. The principal apartments are an old hall, 75 feet by 72, the height 35, and a

<PB N="356" REF="438">ground on which this town and ca&s;tle are placed is of an angular form, or rather like the point of a barbed arrow; the &s;treets are extended on the &s;ides of the angle, and terminate in a point at the ca&s;tle, the interior &s;pace being a regular plain, forming a very &s;pacious market-place. The eminence is wa&s;hed on the north &s;ide by the river Wear, and on the &s;outh-ea&s;t by the river Gaunle&s;s: the banks are formed into hanging gardens, and the whole a&s;pect is extremely beautiful. The ground on which the town &s;tands is near one hundred and forty perpendicular feet from the level of the plain below: the buildings are erected on the very brink of the hill on each &s;ide, which is &s;teep, &s;o that the roads leading from the town north|ward are both di&s;agreeable and difficult to be de&s;cended on hor&s;eback. The approach to the ca&s;tle is by an elegant Gothic gateway, erected by the late Bi&s;hop Trevor; the &s;outh front opens upon a fine plot, inclo&s;ed on each hand by an embattled wall, terminating in &s;quare pavilions or turrets:<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Laid open by the pre&s;ent prelate.</NOTE> the building is already
<PB N="357" REF="439">accurately de&s;cribed in that part of Mr. Pennant's work, before repeated: the park affords &s;ome beautiful &s;cenes. The ground near the ca&s;tle is laid out with judg|ment and ta&s;te in &s;lopes and terraces, &s;o applied as to command the greate&s;t variety of pro&s;pects. The nearer land&s;capes are compo&s;ed of wild and irregular woodlands, bold cliffs, and eminences, mighled in a picture&s;que manner, holding forth the &s;imple and undi&s;torted beauties of nature: the more di&s;tant are compo&s;ed of rich cultivated grounds, through which the Wear winds its cour&s;e. As the vi&s;itor enters upon the park, the view is mo&s;t confined; &s;tately trees are &s;cattered over the inclining lawn, at who&s;e foot runs the river Gaunle&s;s, the oppo&s;ite bounds of the &s;tream being formed of high perpendicular cliffs, over who&s;e brink venerable oaks &s;u&s;pend their branches; the hills are broken, and afford many deep gra&s;&s;y dells and &s;hady coppices, the favourite haunts of groupes of deer. Pa&s;&s;ing the north-ea&s;t corner of the bowling-green wall, as we enter upon the north terrace, the country opens upon the view, and the land&s;cape is excellent. The chief object in the nearer vale is the deer-hou&s;e. A road winds through the valley, and, by a &s;tone bridge, pa&s;&s;es the Gaunle&s;s, who&s;e banks are thronged with a grove of venerable oaks and alders. To the right the grounds form a &s;wift de&s;cent; in front, at the di&s;tance of a mile, on a fine lofty &s;ituation, is Binche&s;ter; the ragged and &s;haken &s;ides of the hill give much picture&s;que beauty to the land&s;cape, con|tra&s;ting highly with the vale, compo&s;ed of fine cultivated lands, &s;cattered over with coppices and hamlets, opening upon the view for the length of &s;even miles, through which you &s;ee the meandring &s;treams of Wear in innumerable places, inter&s;ected by projecting promontories and little groves. To the left the country ri&s;es gradually, and appears in high cultivation: There Newton Cap bridge, of two arches, cro&s;&s;es the Wear, above which &s;tands the man&s;ion-hou&s;e of the Bacon family. The mo&s;t di&s;tant lands are of a ruder a&s;pect, being lately inclo&s;ed, forming an horizon a painter would chu&s;e, to give an advantage to the high colouring in the nearer vale.</P>

This i&s;land was, by the Britons, called <HI>Inis Medicante;</HI> al&s;o, <HI>Lindisfarn,</HI> from the &s;mall rivulet of <HI>Lindi,</HI> which here runs into the &s;ea; and the Celtic word, <HI>falren,</HI> or rece&s;s; al&s;o, on account of its being the habitation of &s;ome of the fir&s;t monks in this country, it afterwards obtained its pre&s;ent name of <HI>Holy I&s;land.</HI> It mea&s;ures from ea&s;t to we&s;t about two miles and a quarter; and its breadth, from north to &s;outh, is &s;carcely a mile and a half. At the north-we&s;t part, there runs out a &s;pit of land, of about a mile in length.

The &s;hore of this i&s;land is, in many parts, excellent for bath|ing, and the &s;ituation is at once healthy and romantic: it is, of late years, become a place of great re&s;ort; and much prai&s;ed for the beauties that grace its &s;olemn walks. The north and ea&s;t coa&s;ts of the i&s;land are formed of perpendicular rocks; the other &s;ides &s;ink by gradual declinations towards the &s;ands. The fi&s;hermen, in the winter &s;ea&s;on, are employed in catching lob&s;ters, which are &s;ent in great quantities to the London market. Ten or twelve, three or four men-boats are u&s;ed in the &s;ummer, fi&s;hing for cod, ling, and haddocks, which abound on the coa&s;t.</P>
<P>On the north part of the i&s;land, there is abundance of lime&s;tone; and a &s;mall &s;eam of coal, never much worked, on account of the water, and other difficulties. There is plenty of iron ore in a bed of black &s;hiver or &s;late; among which are the <HI>Entrochi,</HI> or St. Cuthbert's beads, as the &s;uper&s;titious have called them.

A fortre&s;s in this &s;ituation, before the u&s;e of gunpowder, would be almo&s;t impreg|nable, where the &s;uper&s;tructures would be above the reach of any engine, and the rocks too high to be &s;caled. The antiquity of this ca&s;tle is not known, but we pre&s;ume there was &s;ome &s;trong-hold here, nearly coeval with the abbey, formed after the Danes had been guilty of their fir&s;t exce&s;&s;es, and u&s;ed as a place of refuge for the religious, whenever they were di&s;turbed in their holy retreat; though hi&s;torians have not related to us, whether any &s;tand was made there again&s;t the invading Danes, at their &s;econd de&s;cent.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The following extracts are taken from Mr. Gro&s;e's work: <Q>Camden mentions it, &s;o that it is evi|dently &startq;as old as his time.

<P>"Holy I&s;land does not appear ever to have fallen into the hands of the royali&s;ts; for it continued in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the parliamentarians, anno 1648, when it was, as may be &s;een in Ru&s;hworth, relieved with nece&s;&s;aries by Col. Fenwick's hor&s;e and &s;ome dragoons. From that time, nothing memorable &s;eems to have been tran&s;acted here, till the rebellion in the year 1715, when the &s;eizure of this ca&s;tle was plan|ned, and performed by two men only: in which exploit, &s;uch policy and courage were exerted, as would have done them much honour, had they been employed in a better cau&s;e. The following particulars of the &s;tory were communicated by a gentleman, who&s;e father was an eye-witne&s;s to the facts, and well knew both the parties.</P>
<P>"One <HI>Lancelot Errington,</HI> a man of an ancient and re&s;pectable family, in Northumberland, and of a bold and enterpri&s;ing &s;pirit, entered into a con&s;piracy, for &s;eizing this ca&s;tle for the pretender; in which, it is &s;aid, he was promi&s;ed a&s;&s;i&s;tance, not only by Mr. For&s;ter, the rebel general, then in arms, but al&s;o by the ma&s;ters of &s;everal French privateers. At this time the garri&s;on con&s;i&s;ted of a &s;erjeant, a corporal, and ten or twelve men only. In order to put this &s;cheme in execution, being well known in that country, he went to the ca&s;tle, and after &s;ome di&s;cour&s;e with the &s;erjeant, invited him and the re&s;t of the men, who were not immediately on duty, to partake of a treat on board of the &s;hip of which he was ma&s;ter, then lying in the harbour: this being un&s;u&s;pectedly accepted of, he &s;o well plied his gue&s;ts with brandy, that they were &s;oon incapable of any oppo&s;ition. The&s;e men being thus &s;ecured, he made &s;ome pretence of going on &s;hore, and with <HI>Mark Errington,</HI> his nephew, returning again to the ca&s;tle, they knocked down the centinel, &s;urpri&s;ed and turned out an old gunner, the corporal, and two other &s;oldiers, being the remainder of the garri&s;on, and &s;hutting the gates, hoi&s;ted the pretender's colours as a &s;ignal of their &s;ucce&s;s, anxiou&s;ly expecting the promi&s;ed &s;uccours. No rein&s; orcement coming, but on the contrary, a party of the king's troops arriving from Berwick, they were obliged to retreat over the walls of the ca&s;tle among the rocks, hoping to conceal them&s;elves under the &s;ea weeds till it was dark, and then by &s;wimming to the main land, to make their e&s;cape; but the tide ri&s;ing, they were obliged to &s;wim, when the &s;oldiers firing at Lancelot, as he climbing up a rock, wounded him in the thigh; thus di&s;abled, he and his nephew were taken, and conveyed to Berwick goal, where they continued till his wound was cured. During this time, he had digged a burrow quite under the foundations of the pri&s;on, depo&s;iting the earth taken out, in an old oven. Through this burrow, he and his nephew, and divers other pri&s;on|ers e&s;caped; but mo&s;t of the latter were &s;oon after taken. The two Erringtons, however, had the good fortune to make their way to the Tweed&s;ide, where they found the cu&s;tom-hou&s;e boat; they rowed them|&s;elves over, and afterwards turned it adrift. From thence they pur&s;ued their journey to Bambrough ca&s;tle, near which they were concealed nine days in a pea &s;tack; a relation who re&s;ided in the ca&s;tle &s;up|plying them with provi&s;ion. At length travelling in the night by &s;ecret paths, they reached Gate&s;head-hou&s;e, near Newca&s;tle, where they were &s;ecreted, till they procured a pa&s;&s;age from Sunderland to France. A reward of 500 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> was now offered to any one who would apprehend them; notwith&s;tanding which, Lancelot was &s;o daring, as &s;oon after to come into England, and even to vi&s;it &s;ome of his friends in New|gate. After the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of the rebellion, when every thing was quiet, he and his nephew took the benefit of the general pardon, and returned to Newca&s;tle, where he died about the year 1746, as it &s;aid, of grief at the victory of Culloden."</P></NOTE> The pre&s;ent fortifications appear to be the work of the la&s;t century.</P>
<PB N="363" REF="445">
<P>In the military e&s;tabli&s;hment, made by Queen Elizabeth for Berwick, in 1576, this ca&s;tle is noted, and a patent for life was granted to Sir William Read, as keeper of the fortre&s;&s;es of Holy I&s;land and Farn, with a yearly payment of 362 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> 17 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> 6 <ABBR>d.</ABBR></P>
<P>Great remains of the old abbey are &s;tanding; nothing but confu&s;ed ruins &s;hew where the mona&s;tic buildings &s;tood, the walls having been robbed for building parts of the village, and for the erection of the pre&s;ent parochial church. Some authors have alleged, that the mona&s;tery was built by <HI>St. Cuthbert,</HI> of an humble model, without ornament, and inclo&s;ed with a high wall, in order that outward objects might not withdraw the attention of the reclu&s;e from divine contempla|tions.</P>
<P>The ancient church was in the form of a cro&s;s, the body and chancel of which are yet &s;tanding, the other parts greatly ruined, and in &s;ome places level with the ground. The order of building in this &s;tructure is rude and heavy, and mo&s;t of it in the wor&s;t mode of the early Saxon architecture. Mr. Gro&s;e &s;aid, <Q>Probably &startq;it was the work of different periods; great part of it &s;eems very ancient, the arches being circular, and the columns very ma&s;&s;y, and much like tho&s;e at Durham, but richer. On the north and &s;outh walls, there are pointed arches, &endq;which prove that part of it, at lea&s;t, was built &s;ince the reign of Henry II.</Q> It is evident that the &s;quare tower, or &s;teeple, has been erected long after the fir&s;t building of the church, as well as &s;everal other parts. The pillars, on which the arches ri&s;e in the centre of the cro&s;s, are clu&s;tered and plain capitalled, each form|ing a corner of the great tower; tho&s;e arches are of few members. There are &s;ide ailes, the columns of which are heavy, and the arches &s;emicircular; where the arches are pointed, the &s;tones are little injured by time; where the arches are &s;emicircular, the &s;tones are much decayed.</P>
<PB N="364" REF="446">
<P>The windows are narrow, and ornamented with a corner pila&s;ter, and a mould|ing of few members: the walls are very thick, and every part wears a gloomy countenance. The &s;outh wall of the centre tower is &s;tanding, about 50 feet high; and one corner tower at the we&s;t end remains perfect. The ruins retain, at this day, one &s;ingular beauty; the tower has formed a lanthorn, as in mo&s;t cathedrals, but from the angles, arches were &s;prung, cro&s;&s;ing each other diagonally, to form a canopy roof. One of the bows of an arch yet remains, unloaded with any &s;u|per&s;tructure, &s;upported by the &s;outh-ea&s;t and north-we&s;t corner pillars, and orna|mented with the dancette or zigzag moulding, u&s;ed in the old Saxon architecture, extending a &s;ine &s;emicircle over the cha&s;m, and heap of ruins of the fallen ailes. The whole &s;tructure is formed of a red free&s;tone, which yields much to time, and renders the a&s;pect of the building dark and melancholy. Mr. Gro&s;e ob&s;erves the following particulars: <Q>Various fragments of the offices of the mona&s;tery are &s;till &startq;&s;tanding, and foundations of walls are &s;cattered over a clo&s;e of near four acres. The main walls of the church, on the north and &s;outh &s;ides, are &s;till &s;tanding, though much out of the perpendicular; inclining outwards &s;o con&s;iderably, as to make the horizontal di&s;tance between them at the top, exceed, by near two feet, that at the bottom. Another winter or two &s;eems to be the mo&s;t that they can &s;tand. This building con&s;i&s;ts of a body and two &s;ide ailes, into which it is divided by a double row of very &s;olid columns, who&s;e &s;hafts are richly ornamented. Each row has five columns, of four different con&s;tructions, and two pila&s;ters in the walls on the ea&s;t and we&s;t ends. The &s;hafts of the&s;e columns are about twelve feet high, their diameters about five; their capitals and pede&s;tals are plain, they &s;upport circular arches, having over each arch two ranges of windows; the lowe&s;t large and in pairs, &s;eparated only by a &s;hort column; the upper &s;mall and &s;ingle. The length of the building is about 138 feet, the breadth of the &endq;body, 18 feet; and that of the two &s;ide ailes, about nine feet each.</Q> The chancel appears to have been rebuilt in much more modern times, and with very little ornament.</P>
<P>In the year 941, this i&s;land &s;uffered much by the ravages of war.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Inde Ebora&s;en&s;es Lindisfarnem in&s;ulam va&s;tantes multos occiderunt.&mdash;Lel Col. vol.

<P>For the valor, vid Farn I&s;lands.</P>
<P>Holy I&s;land was the retreat of William de Sancta Barbara, during part of the time that Cuming held the &s;ee and ca&s;tle of Durham. William, on the 18th of Oct. A. D. 1144, was in&s;talled Bi&s;hop.</P></NOTE></P>
<P>The <HI>Farn I&s;lands</HI> po&s;&s;e&s;s little matter of con&s;equence, to tempt a traveller to &s;ea, e&s;pecially where there is &s;o con&s;tant a ripling and breaking of the waves, as is to be found between them and the main land.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">"A certain prie&s;t, named <HI>Utta,</HI> a man of great gravity and &s;incerity; and one who, for his qualities and truth was well e&s;teemed, was commi&s;&s;ioned to go into Kent, for Ean&s;lede, King Edwin's daughter, who after her father's death had been &s;ent thither, in order to her e&s;pou&s;al with King O&s;win. He was to travel by land to Kent, but was to return by &s;ea; on which account he addre&s;&s;ed Bi&s;hop Aidan, be|&s;eeching him to put up fervent prayers to God, to pro&s;per their voyage. The bi&s;hop gave them his ble&s;&s;ing, and having recommended them devoutly to the protection of God; he al&s;o delivered to <HI>Utta,</HI> &s;ome jars of hallowed oil, &s;aying, I fore&s;ee, that whil&s;t you are at &s;ea, a &s;udden tempe&s;t will come upon you; remember to ca&s;t into the troubled waters the oil that I give you, and &s;peedily the tempe&s;t &s;hall be a&s;&s;uaged, and the &s;ea be ca$med, and you &s;hall have a pro&s;perous voyage. All the&s;e things were fulfilled according to the prophecy. At the beginning of the tempe&s;t, when the waves chiefly raged, the &s;ailors endeavoured in vain to ca&s;t anchor, but the &s;torm increa&s;ed and the waves multiplied &s;o fa&s;t, that the ve&s;&s;el was almo&s;t filled with water, and nothing but immediate death pre&s;ented it&s;elf. In this di&s;tre&s;s, the prie&s;t had recour&s;e to the bi&s;hop's directions, and took the pot of oil, &s;ome of which he ca&s;t into the &s;ea, and the &s;ea was immediately calmed, and the &s;hip proceeded with a pro&s;perous voyage. Thus the man of God, through the &s;pirit of prophecy, predicted the tempe&s;t, and by the Holy Spirit, though he was him&s;elf ab&s;ent, appea&s;ed the &s;ame."</NOTE> In the month of Augu&s;t,
<PB N="366" REF="448">when we vi&s;ited the i&s;lands, the &s;ea was tumultuous, making a violent in&s;et be|tween them and the oppo&s;ite &s;hore. They are 17 in number, the large&s;t and only one we thought worth attending to, is the Hou&s;e I&s;land, neare&s;t to Bambrough, where St. Cuthbert made his re&s;idence. Mr. Pennant vi&s;ited them all, and his judicious remarks we have collected in the notes.<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">The neare&s;t i&s;le to the &s;hore lies exactly one mile, 68 chains, from the coa&s;t; the mo&s;t di&s;tant, is about &s;even or eight miles. They are rented for 16 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> per ann. their produce is kelp, &s;ome few feathers, and &s;eals, which the tenant watches and &s;hoots, for the &s;ake of the oil and &s;kins. Some of them yield a little gra&s;s, and &s;erve to feed a cow or two, which the people are de&s;perate enough to tran&s;port over in their little boats. We vi&s;ited the&s;e i&s;lands in a coble, a &s;afe, but &s;eemingly hazardous &s;pecies of boat, long, narrow, and flat-bottomed, which is capable of going through a high &s;ea, dancing like a cork on the &s;um|mits of the waves. Touched at the rock called <HI>Meg,</HI> whitened with the dung of corvorants, which almo&s;t covered it; their ne&s;ts were large, made of tang, and exce&s;&s;ively faetid. Rowed near the <HI>Pinnacles,</HI> an i&s;land in the farthe&s;t group; &s;o called from the va&s;t columnar rocks at the &s;outh end, even at their &s;ides, and flat at their tops, and entirely covered with guillemots and &s;hags; the fowlers pa&s;s from one to the other of the&s;e columns, by means of a narrow board, which they place from top to top, forming a narrow bridge over &s;uch a horrid gap, that the very &s;ight of it &s;trikes one with terror. Landed at a &s;mall i&s;land, where we found the female eider-ducks at that time &s;itting; the lower part of their ne&s;ts was made of &s;ea-plants; the upper part was formed of the down which they pull off their own brea&s;ts, in which the eggs were &s;urrounded and warmly bedded; in &s;ome were three, in others five eggs, of a large &s;ize, and pale olive colour, as &s;mooth and glo&s;&s;y as if varni&s;hed over. The ne&s;ts are built over the beach, among the loo&s;e pebbles, not far from the water. The ducks &s;it very clo&s;e, nor will they ri&s;e, till you almo&s;t tread on them. The drakes &s;eparate them&s;elves from the females during the breeding &s;ea&s;on. We robbed a few of their ne&s;ts of the down, after carefully &s;eparating it from the tang, found that the down of one ne&s;t weighed only three quarters of an ounce; but was &s;o ela&s;tic, as to fill the crown of the large&s;t hat. The people of this country call the&s;e, St. Cuthbert's ducks, from the &s;aint of the i&s;lands. Be&s;ides the&s;e kinds, I ob&s;erved the following: Puffins, called here tom-noddies.&mdash;Auks, here &s;kouts.&mdash;Guillemots.&mdash; Black guillemots.&mdash;Little auks.&mdash;Shiel auks.&mdash;Shags.&mdash;Corvorants.&mdash;Black and white gulls.&mdash;Brown and white gulls.&mdash;Herring gulls, which I was told, &s;ometimes fed on eggs of other birds.&mdash;Common gulls, here annets.&mdash;Kittiwakes or tarrock.&mdash;Pewit gulls.&mdash;Great terns.&mdash;Sea-pies.&mdash;Sea-larks, here brockets.&mdash;Jack-daws, which breed in rabbit-holes.&mdash;Rich pigeons.&mdash;Rock-larks. The terns were &s;o numerous, that in &s;ome places it was difficult to tread without cru&s;hing &s;ome of the eggs. At the north end of the Hou&s;e-i&s;land, is a deep cha&s;m, from the top to the bottom of the rock, communicating to the &s;ea, through which, in tempe&s;tuous weather, the water is forced with va&s;t violence and noi&s;e, and forms a fine <HI>jet d'eau,</HI> of &s;ixty feet high; it is called by the inhabitants of the oppo&s;ite coa&s;t, the <HI>churn.</HI>

<P>The horrible de&s;cription given of this i&s;land by ancient authors, before <HI>St. Cuthbert</HI> ble&s;&s;ed it with his pre&s;ence, is already mentioned, vol. I. p. 22. After the death of <HI>St. Cuthbert, Ethelwold,</HI> who took on him the religious habit at Ripon, re&s;orted to the hermitage of Farn, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed it twelve years, ending his life there. <HI>Felgild</HI> &s;ucceeded <HI>Ethelwold;</HI> and in the time of that hermit, <HI>Eadfrid,</HI> Bi&s;hop of Lindisfarn, re&s;tored, from its foundations, the oratory of <HI>St. Cuthbert,</HI> which had gone to ruin. <HI>Bede</HI> relates, that <HI>Felgild</HI> was more than 70 years old when he wrote the life of <HI>St. Cuthbert.</HI> Be&s;ides the per&s;ons mentioned by <HI>Bede,</HI> there were other devotees who cho&s;e Farn for the place of their retreat. <HI>St. Bar|tholomew</HI> was one, as appears from a manu&s;cript hi&s;tory of his life in the Bodleian Library, who obtained leave of Lawrence, Prior of Durham, to go to <HI>Farn,</HI> where he found one <HI>Elwyn</HI> in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the de&s;irable re&s;idence, and who&s;e religion was not &s;ufficiently tempered with charity, to induce him to welcome the &s;tranger. <HI>Bartholomew</HI> wrote in this retreat his Farn meditations, now pre&s;erved in the Dur|ham Library.

<P>This part of the county, &s;ituated on the north of Northumberland, is of a tri|angular form, and contains 72 &s;quare miles; it is chiefly inclo&s;ed, but has a naked appearance, from being almo&s;t de&s;titute of wood, or hedge-row trees: Fenwick wood is the only natural wood in it; a few ri&s;ing plantations are &s;cattered here and there, which in a few years, will in &s;ome mea&s;ure remedy this defect. The farms in general are large, from 400 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> to 800 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> a-year, and well cultivated. The &s;oil is a &s;trong and fertile clay, mixed with loam, except a tract up Tweed&s;ide; and a plot, &s;tretching from the Till to Cornhill, which is rich, friable, dry loam; an excellent turnip &s;oil. Lime and coal abound, but the latter is of an inferior quality. Stone marle is found on the banks of the Tweed, but not u&s;ed on account of the great expence which attends it.</P>
<PB N="391" REF="465">
<P>The pre&s;ent village lies in a low &s;ituation, on the banks of the river Tweed; except the lofty ca&s;tle that crowns the adjoining eminence, there are few remains to prove the antiquity of the place; Hoveden called it Ubbanford; and we have &s;uch proofs on record, of its &s;ignificance in the annals of the border hi&s;tory, that its di&s;tant antiquity is undeniable.</P>
<P>The building of the church at Norham occurs in the beginning of the ninth century: Egrid, to whom that godly work is attributed, was con&s;ecrated Bi&s;hop of Lindisfarn, A.

The middle aile only of the ancient church is now &s;tanding, and by &s;ome modern repairs, is rendered a decent place of wor&s;hip. The chancel, or ea&s;t end of the church, appears to have been totally de&s;troyed; the pre&s;ent vicar, the Rev. Robert Lambe, in levelling the ruins of walls in the church-yard, di&s;covered a &s;culpture, which, we apprehend, was the ornament of an ancient font. There are repre&s;ented on this &s;tone three per&s;on|ages; in the upper compartment St. Peter with his keys; in the lower compart|ment St. Cuthbert, and St. Ceolwolf with his &s;ceptre: on the fillet which divides the&s;e figures is an in&s;cription, beginning I. H.

<P>There were three chauntries in this church, one of which was dedicated to St. Cuthbert, the founder's name not now known. One Thomas de Kellawe occurs chaplain in the year 1362.

Bi&s;hop William Carilepho, who &s;ucceeded Walcher, in con&s;equence of his palatine juri&s;diction, di&s;played a military &s;tandard, &s;imilar to that of a &s;overeign prince, which was called <HI>the banner of St. Cuthbert,</HI> and was carried with the troops with which Edgar marched into Scotland. This expedition might furni&s;h an idea, that a fortre&s;s at Norham would prove a barrier of the utmo&s;t con&s;equence to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of the church, and to the protection of Northumberland. The bi&s;hop's death followed &s;oon after Edgar's expedition; and the &s;ee remained vacant be|tween three and four years, before Ralph de Flambard was con&s;ecrated Bi&s;hop of Durham, 1099. The convul&s;ions of the &s;tate, and the adver&s;ity which Bi&s;hop Ralph experienced, prevented him executing a plan he had conceived on his ob|taining the &s;ee; for he was of a bold and enterpri&s;ing &s;pirit, and had a genius for military affairs: Edgar had granted Berwick previous to this aera, but its chief con&s;equence was in maritime affairs, of which we hear little, when compared to the warfares on land; &s;o that a fortre&s;s, &s;uch as Norham, would appear of the greate&s;t con&s;equence to the frontier. It was not till the year 1121, that the pre|late effected this great work; it is &s;ituated on the brink of a &s;teep rock, who&s;e foot is wa&s;hed by the river Tweed.<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ranulphus quoque Dunelmen&s;is epi&s;copus, Ca&s;tellum incipit apud Norham &s;uper Ripam Twed$e.

<PB N="394" REF="468"><Q>&startq;to be &s;ituated on the top of a high &s;teep rock, and fortified with a trench: the outward wall of great circuit, was guarded by &s;everal turrets, in a canton to|wards the river, in which another wall, much &s;tronger, incircled the keep or &endq;tower, of great height.</Q> This de&s;cription furni&s;hes a perfect idea of the figure of this fortre&s;s, after it had received repairs by Bi&s;hop Tun&s;tal. Towards the river, the ruins now hang upon the very verge of the precipice; part of which, by the wa&s;hing of the &s;tream, has given way, and carried with it the &s;uper&s;tructures on that &s;ide; which, with the decay incident to the length of time, has occa&s;ioned a wide breach in the outward wall, &s;poken of by Camden: the turrets, as he was plea&s;ed to call them, appear to be no other than demi-ba&s;tions, a mode of fortifi|cation generally followed, in which the chief &s;trength of this ca&s;tle was con&s;tructed; a perfect model of which we have de&s;cribed to the reader, under the title of Hartlepool, a place pre&s;umed to be of nearly the &s;ame date.</P>
<P>The wall of Norham ca&s;tle, which &s;tretched from the water on the &s;outh &s;ide, was guarded with a gateway and tower above it, having &s;quare turrets on each hand: the a&s;cent from thence was &s;teep, the way bending towards the ea&s;t; and through the wall, the entrance was by another gateway of &s;uperior dimen&s;ions, fortified by two heavy round flanking towers, the remains of which are &s;till con|&s;iderable. This appears to have been the chief entrance, and fronts to a plain of con&s;iderable extent; it was defended by a draw-bridge over a very wide moat, which began near to this gateway, and was extended round the ca&s;tle on the land|&s;ide, inclo&s;ing a &s;pacious area or ballium, fortified with a very &s;trong wall, garni&s;hed with demi-ba&s;tions at intervals. To defend the keep or main tower, a &s;trong wall inclo&s;es a narrow area or interior ballium, which is entered by a gateway, guarded on each hand by &s;quare towers. The keep is a very heavy &s;quare build|ing, vaulted underneath, like mo&s;t &s;tructures of this &s;ort. Part of the vaults or pri&s;ons remain entire, but all the interior parts of the tower above, are laid open and ruined. The remains of an exploratory turret appear on one corner of the keep; it may be pre&s;umed it was uniform, with &s;imilar turrets on the other cor|ners. The height of the great tower is about &s;eventy feet, containing four &s;tories, or ranges of apartments. The whole building is con&s;tructed of red free&s;tone, of a &s;oft nature, and &s;ubject to decay: there is not the lea&s;t ornament about it; the whole a&s;pect is mi&s;erably gloomy: it wears the countenance of the time of King Stephen, without any of the embelli&s;hments of the age in which Bi&s;hop Tun&s;tal lived.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ob. 1528.</NOTE></P>
<P>The outworks, of late years, have been much demoli&s;hed, particularly near to the we&s;tern gate; the a&s;hler &s;tones of the facing of the wall are all removed; and only the rubble and cement, or run-lime, with which the inner part of the wall was filled, remain; which has a very rugged and ruinous appearance. The&s;e de|predations were made by Mr. Thomas Alder, for the building of a farm-hou&s;e a little way to the &s;outh of the ca&s;tle. Mr. Alder purcha&s;ed the ca&s;tle of Mr. Fenwick of Lemington, and has lately &s;old it to Sir Francis Blake, Bart. who&s;e veneration for the works of antiquity, will protect the&s;e remains from the hand of wanton de&s;truction.</P>
<PB N="395" REF="469">
<P>This was a formidable fortre&s;s, inacce&s;&s;ible from the Tweed; and, before the u&s;e of fire arms, appears to have been impregnable, when fully garri&s;oned, and duly provided with &s;tores for a &s;iege: when the oillets and other parts, formed for the garri&s;on's fighting and defence, were properly armed with engines, and manned with experienced archers; and when the ba&s;tions were kept by men of courage, it &s;eems almo&s;t incredible, that the place could be taken by a&s;&s;ault.</P>
<P>After Bi&s;hop Flambard's death, the ca&s;tle did not remain long una&s;&s;ailed by the Scots, in 1138, whil&s;t Galfrid Rufus was bi&s;hop, King David I. of Scotland, be&s;ieged Norham; the ca&s;tle is de&s;cribed to con&s;i&s;t, at that time, of a very &s;trong tower, &s;urrounded with a wall. The Scotch forces having refu&s;ed to proceed on their incur&s;ion, on account of the &s;olemnities of Lent, retreated from the ea&s;tern parts of the county of Durham, where they had committed dreadful depredations, and undertook the &s;iege of this ca&s;tle in their return homeward; it was at that time thinly garri&s;oned, with nine knights only and their attendants: a gallant defence was made for &s;ome days, but no &s;uccours arriving, the place was &s;urren|dered, and the defenders were permitted to retire. David propo&s;ed to the Bi&s;hop to re&s;ign the ca&s;tle, on condition that he &s;hould renounce his allegiance to Stephen, in favour of the Empre&s;s Maud; on the bi&s;hop refu&s;ing to accept &s;uch terms, the king cau&s;ed the ca&s;tle and town of Norham to be de&s;troyed.<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Lyt.

<P>The ca&s;tle and fortifications were re&s;tored by Hugh Pud&s;ey, Bi&s;hop of Durham, in the year 1154: he then built the great tower, which remains to this day. The prelate purcha&s;ed his peace with the king, for certain defections in favour of the Scotch, whom he &s;uffered to pa&s;s unre&s;i&s;ted through the lands of his palatinate, by &s;urrendering to him this fortre&s;s. Roger de Coniers, who was con&s;table of the ca&s;tle, re&s;igned it to Will. de Nevill, the king's nominee,<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Rym. Tom. II. p. 564.&mdash;Hugo Pu&s;ar Epus Dun.

<P>This prelate granted a charter of privileges to his burge&s;&s;es of Norham, of equal tenure with other burgages north of Tyne, and &s;imilar to tho&s;e of Newca&s;tle; and he al&s;o granted to them certain lands, to be holden as freely as they had done in Bi&s;hop Flambard's time, re&s;erving to the men, or dependants of the Schori&s;|worth monks, their common of pa&s;ture.<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Carta Hugonis Epi conce&s;&s;a Burgen&s;ibus de Norham.&mdash;E.

The &s;ee was vacant from the death of Bi&s;hop Philip, in 1208, to the time of Richard de Mari&s;co's confir|mation, in 1217: during this vacancy, in the year 1209, King John came with a great army to Norham, whil&s;t the King of Scotland was a&s;&s;embling his troops at Roxburgh, and a dreadful war &s;eemed to be threatened from the Engli&s;h &s;ove|reign's extravagant demands, and vehement wrath again&s;t the Scotti&s;h nation; but by the intervention of the nobles of both nations, the two monarchs agreed to adjourn their conference to Newca&s;tle, whither the King of Scotland immediately repaired, attended by his brother David, and a large train of his nobility; but be|ing &s;uddenly taken ill, a truce was agreed upon, till the king's health was re&s;tored. The di&s;pute remaining un&s;ettled, the armies of both nations continued a&s;&s;embled, until the nobles again prevailed to renew the conference at Norham, in the &s;ame year, when a treaty of peace was concluded, in which King John &s;tipulated not to erect any fortre&s;s at Tweedmouth, which the &s;tates of Scotland had &s;trenuou&s;ly oppo&s;ed; and King William, on the other hand, depo&s;ited a large &s;um of money, to indemnify the &s;ufferers for the ravages he had committed on the Engli&s;h borders.</P>
<P>In the year 1211, the two &s;overeigns held another conference at the ca&s;tle of Norham; at which Ermengard, Queen of Scotland, was pre&s;ent, and by her amiable and conciliating conduct, greatly promoted the treaty, on which they had met. Here the terms of the former peace were ratified, and &s;everal new articles were agreed to.</P>
<P>In the year 1213, King John, in the utmo&s;t apprehen&s;ions of an in&s;urrection of his &s;ubjects, and an inva&s;ion from France, in con&s;equence of the papal interdict that had been pronounced, came again to Norham, anxious to &s;ecure the amity of Scotland. William, the Scotch king, was then much indi&s;po&s;ed, and was not able to proceed further than Haddington to meet the King of England. Highly
<PB N="397" REF="471">chagrined at this di&s;appointment, John returned &s;outhward, and it was not long before the &s;entence of depo&s;ition was pronounced again&s;t him, his kingdom given to the king of France, and a croi&s;ade publi&s;hed again&s;t his territories, by the emi&s;&s;aries of the &s;ee of Rome. Driven to &s;ad dilemmas, John was at length obliged to make his peace with the holy &s;ee; the interdict, which had continued &s;ix years, was revoked, and the lands of tho&s;e who had adhered to the papal au|thority again&s;t their &s;overeign, &amp;c. had been pronounced forfeitures to the crown; of which, tho&s;e of Eu&s;tace de Ve&s;ey were part, were re&s;tored.

<P>A convention was appointed to be holden at Norham, on the 10th day of May, 1290, previous to King Edward I. entering upon a hearing of the claims made by the competitors for the crown of Scotland, on the death of Margaret of Norway, the infant heire&s;s.

<P>In Leland's Collectania, we have the following curious particulars of this &s;iege, from the Scala Chronica:</P>
<P>"The Scottes came yn to the marches of England, and de&s;troyed the Ca&s;telles of Werk and Herbotel, and overran much of Northumberland marches.</P>
<P>"At this tyme Thomas Gray and his frendes defendid Norham from the Scottes.</P>
<P>"It were a wonderfull proce&s;&s;e to declare what mi&s;che&s;es cam by hungre and a&s;&s;eges, by the &s;pace of xi yeres in Northumbreland. For the Scottes became &s;o proude, after they had got Berwick, that the nothing e&s;temid the Engli&s;chmen.</P>
<P>"About this tyme, there was a greate fe&s;t made yn Lincoln&s;hir, to which cam many gentilmen and ladies, and emonge them one lady brought a heualme for a man of were; with a very riche cre&s;te of golde, to William Marmion, knight, with a lettre of commaundement of her lady, that he &s;hould go into the daungeru&s;t place in England, and there to let the heualme to be &s;eene, and knowen as famo&s;e. So he went to Norham, whither withyn 4 dayes of cumming cam Philip Moubray, gardian of Berwike, having in his bande 140 men of armes, the very flour of men of the Scotti&s;ch marches.</P>
<P>"Thomas Gray, capitayne of Norham, feying this, brought his gari&s;on afore the barriers of the ca&s;tel, behynd whom cam William richely arrayed, as all glit|tering in golde, and wearing the heualme, his lady's pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>"Then &s;ayd Thomas Gray to Marmion, "Syr Knight, ye be cum hither to fame your heualme, mount up on yor hor&s;e, and ryde lyke a valiant man to you

<P>"Wherapon he toke his cur&s;ore and rode among the threng of ennemyes, the which layed &s;ore &s;tripes on hym, and pullid hym at the la&s;t oute of his &s;adel to the grounde.</P>
<P>"Then Thomas Gray, with all the hole garni&s;on, lette prick yn emong the Scottes, and &s;o wounded them and their hor&s;es, that they were over throwen, and Marmion &s;ore beten was hor&s;id agayn, and with Gray pur&s;ewid the Scottes in chace. There were taken 50 hor&s;es of price, and the women of Norham brought them to the foote men to follow the chace.</P>
<P>"Thomas Gray hym&s;elf killed one Cryne, a Fleming, an admiral, and great robber on the &s;ee, and yn hye favor with Robert Brui&s;e. The re&s;ydew that e&s;capid were chacid to the nunnes of Berwik.</P>
<P>"Adam de Gordon, a baron of Scotland, cam with 160 men, to dryve away the catel pa&s;turing by Norham, but the yong men of the countery ther aboute, en|countered with them, whom Thomas Gray &s;eing to &s;tande in jeopardy went oute with onely 60 men, and killed mo&s;t parte of the Scottes and their hor&s;is.</P>
<P>"This &s;ame Thomas was tui&s;e a&s;&s;igid yn the ca&s;tel of Norham by the Scottes, one tyme by the &s;pace almo&s;t of an yere, the other vij monithes.</P>
<P>"His ennemies made fortere&s;&s;es before the ca&s;tel, one at Up&s;edelington, a nother yn the chirch of Norham. The ca&s;tel was tui&s;e vitailed by the lord Percy and Neville, that became very noble men, and riche and great &s;ocorers of the marches of England.</P>

<P>On a penin&s;ula formed by the confluence of the rivers Till and Tweed, was an ancient chapel, on the &s;ide of which, about five years ago, Sir Francis Blake built a &s;mall chapel; the windows of which &s;ome wanton and &s;acrilegious villians have lately de&s;troyed. About thirty yards to the we&s;t of this place, and fifteen from the Tweed, lie the the remains of a &s;tone boat or coffin, in which, tradition &s;ays, the body of St. Cuthbert was miraculou&s;ly conveyed down the Tweed from Mailro&s;s. By &s;ome hydro&s;tatical experiments whil&s;t it was intire, we are informed it was proved that it might float with the remains of the &s;aint. Mr. Gough, in his Additions to Camden, &s;ays, that it <Q>is a &s;tone boat, of as fine a &s;hape as a boat of &startq;&endq;wood.</Q> We confe&s;s we did not examine the parts &s;o narrowly, being prejudi|ced with the idea, that they were the mere fragments of a &s;tone coffin.

<P>Sir Thomas Savile, in a letter to Camden (Illu&s;trium virorum Epi&s;tolae, &amp;c. 1691.) conjectures that Northallerton was anciently the <HI>Camalodunum</HI> noted by Antoninus, Ptolemy, Pliny, and Tacitus; and adds, that the Bi&s;hop of Durham had a charter, in which <Q>Patria de Camuloduno continens iii leucas &startq;in latitudine atque 25 in longitudine, ab Edwino Northanhumbrorum rege epi&s;copis Dunelmen&s;ibus &endq;conceditur;</Q> and that the &s;ee of Durham, under this charter, held the territory of Northallerton.</P></NOTE></P>

<P><Q>&startq;In the year 769, Beornredus, or Earnredus, a tyrant in Northumberland, burnt down Catterick, the Roman Cataractonium, but five miles di&s;tant from Northallerton, which latter, therefore, might very well be de&s;troyed by him at the &s;ame time; and continued to lie wa&s;te, till after the death of the two Dani&s;h kings, Inguar and Hubba, A. D. 883, when King Alfred cau&s;ed the de&s;olate part of Northumberland, as all the country between the Humber and the Tweed was then called, to be reinhabited. No &s;ooner had this wi&s;e and good king any re&s;pite from his wars, than he began to repair the lo&s;&s;es &s;u&s;tained from the enemy, by rai&s;ing up demoli&s;hed towns and ca&s;tles out of their ruins, and erecting new ones, where nece&s;&s;ary, for the defence of his territories, or convenient for the habitation of his &s;ubjects. Among others, Alvertune, now called Offerton in Derby&s;hire, is believed to have been one; but &s;ince no anci|ent author gives us their names, is is merely conjecture: and then, why will not the &s;ame conjecture hold as good for Northallerton, that &s;till retains more of his name? and though he fir&s;t be&s;towed the kingdom of Northumberland upon Guthrun, the Dane, at his bapti&s;m, as well as that of the Ea&s;t Angles; and after|wards upon one Guthred, a young man redeemed from captivity, to be placed upon a throne, they were only feudatories to him, and when the latter died, he &endq;reunited both tho&s;e kingdoms to his own dominions.</Q></P>

<P>This diminution probably happened when William Rufus &s;eized the liberty, and on the re&s;titution by Henry I. the &s;evered parts were not re&s;tored; a cir|cum&s;tance Mr. Gale had not noticed.</P>
<P><Q>&startq;The town was a third time de&s;troyed by the Scots (led by Sir James Douglas and Thomas Randolf) in the 12th King Edward II. when they made an inroad to the very gates of York, as appears by a mandate of that king, directed the year following to the collectors of the taxes, to exempt it, and &s;everal others, from the payment thereof, in con&s;ideration that they had been ruined by tho&s;e &endq;his enemies and rebels.</Q></P>

<P>On the ea&s;t &s;ide of the &s;treet, and oppo&s;ite to the church, is an old fabric called the Porch-hou&s;e, where tradition &s;ays, King Charles I. lodged, when on his pro|gre&s;s to the north.</P>
<P>Leland noticed the brook which runs cro&s;s the &s;treet, called Sunbeck, and adds, <Q>&startq;a litle by north without Alverton toun, is a bridge of one arch of &s;tone, through the which commith a bigger broke than Sunbeck, toward the we&s;t, and pa&s;&s;ith through the meadows, betwixt the ca&s;telle hilles and the bi&s;hope's palace, and thereabout receiveth Sunnebeck, and within half a mile lower goeth into Wi&s;k. &endq;The name of this bigger broke is Willow Beck.</Q>&mdash;By this and other notes of Leland's, it appears, that in his time the bi&s;hop's palace and ca&s;tle were two di&s;tinct places, divided by Willow Beck.</P>
<P><Q>&startq;The ca&s;tle was built near the town, on the we&s;t &s;ide, by the Bi&s;hop Galfridus Rufus, in the time of Henry I. but much nearer to it than the old Roman ca&s;trum. This bi&s;hop gave it to a nephew of his, that had married a niece of the Earl of Albemarle's, as God win &s;ays; but the continuator of Symeon Dunel|men&s;is tells exactly the &s;ame &s;tory of William Cumin, chancellor of Scotland, who had made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of the bi&s;hopric, upon the death of the bi&s;hop, A.

<P>About the time of the di&s;&s;olution, here were a ma&s;ter, three chaplains, four brethren, two &s;i&s;ters, and nine poor per&s;ons.</P>
<P>On the ea&s;t &s;ide of the town was a hou&s;e of Carmelites, or white friars, founded by Bi&s;hop Hatfield; or, as it is variou&s;ly reported, by King Edward III. jointly with the prelate, about the year 1354; it was dedicated to St. Mary. This hou&s;e was &s;urrendered on the 20th of November, 1539, by Will. Wommefraye, warden, and nine brethren. The &s;ite was in the &s;eventh year of King Edward VI. granted to Richard Vava&s;our of Birkin, and Henry Vava&s;our of London, from whom, after pa&s;&s;ing through various hands, it became the property of Robert Rakes Fulthorpe, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> who &s;old it to William Wales, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR>; it &s;till retains the ancient name of the <HI>Freerage,</HI> and the terrace and &s;ome foundations of the walls are &s;till to be traced.

<P><Q>&startq;There was a grammar and &s;inging &s;chool here in 1327, when the prior of Durham pre&s;ented John Pede&s;ey to be ma&s;ter of it.

The hou&s;e is an ancient borough|hou&s;e, and gives the ma&s;ter a right to vote for members of parliament for the borough. Bi&s;hop Co&s;ins founded &s;ome &s;cholar&s;hips at Peterhou&s;e in Cambridge, of 10 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> p. ann. each, and gave &s;uch &s;cholars as &s;hould be educated in this &s;chool &endq;a right to them, next, and immediately after the &s;cholars of Durham &s;chool.</Q></P>

<P>Since Mr. Gale wrote his account of this place, the church has received &s;everal alterations. In 1779, the chancel being in a dangerous &s;tate, was pulled down, and when rebuilt, was roofed with &s;late; and in 1786, the roof on the we&s;tern part was taken down, and a new one of &s;late placed there; the&s;e alterations have injured the appearance of this building very greatly. The fourth bell in the tower is in&s;cribed, <HI>"In multis annis, re&s;onet campana Johannis;"</HI> it is of a &s;weet tone, and is &s;aid to have belonged to the priory of Mount-grace.</P>
<P>Several of the family of Bowes were interred here in the beginning of the la&s;t century. John Con&s;table of La&s;enby, 1619, and Richard Danby of Romanby, about 1651, were buried in the chancel.

<P>In addition to what we find in Mr. Gale's MSS. we mu&s;t ob&s;erve, that the town of Northallerton, &s;ince the date of Mr. Gale's letter, is much improved in build|ings, there being a great number of very hand&s;ome hou&s;es erected of late years, and it is become the re&s;idence of &s;everal people of con&s;iderable fortune. The lands are in good cultivation, and lying warm, though of a clayi&s;h con&s;titution in general, are yet very forward, and produce abundant crops. Within two or three years la&s;t pa&s;t, a hou&s;e of correction, or penitential hou&s;e, on a new plan, with a very commodious court-hou&s;e, have been built near the &s;outh end of the town, on the ea&s;t &s;ide of the &s;treet. This town is thirty-two miles north of York, and thirty-four miles &s;outh of Durham.</P>
<P>On viewing the Ca&s;tle Banks with much attention, together with a wi&s;h to re|concile, if po&s;&s;ible, a &s;ketch made by the learned Dr. Stukelv, which is copied into Gale's MSS. where the remains are called the Old Roman Camp of Romanby, we found our&s;elves greatly di&s;&s;atisfied: all the vallums are now perfectly gra&s;&s;ed over, and in the whole ground there is not the lea&s;t appearance of ma&s;on-work; &s;o com|pletely have the materials been removed,-for the purpo&s;e of building the hou&s;es in the town, many &s;hewing evidently whence the &s;tones were obtained; bricks being chiefly u&s;ed in the modern edifices, the regi&s;ter office is built of &s;tone. At Romanby there is not any trace that we could di&s;cover of a Roman camp, and &s;ubmit it to the reader's judgment, whether the name of the village is not a corruption of Roman-way, from its &s;uppo&s;ed &s;ituation, or is derived from the name of &s;ome ancient owner of the e&s;tate: if the Romans had a fort in its vicinity, we &s;hould be inclined to conceive with Dr. Stukely, it was &s;ituated where the Ca&s;tle|banks, (as the pre&s;ent remains are now called) do lie; though by &s;uch large and exten&s;ive modern works, the traces of a Roman fort are defaced. The chief or &s;trong hold of the ca&s;tle con&s;i&s;ted of a circular mount, defended by circumvallations and ditches; this mount, it is to be pre&s;umed, &s;upported a tower, and the balliums formed by the circumvallations, according to the fa&s;hion of the times in which this fortre&s;s was erected, mo&s;t probably were &s;trengthened by turrets and ba&s;tions.&mdash; The mount is very &s;teep on the we&s;t &s;ide, bu$ on the ea&s;t the acce&s;s is more gra|dual: it is about twenty feet in perpendicular height, is in circumference three hundred paces, and the &s;ides are &s;o &s;teep as to be a&s;cended with difficulty: the crown is a level plain. Immediately at the foot of the mount is a ditch which runs quite round it. On the we&s;t &s;ide a vallum ri&s;es immediately on the out&s;ide of the ditch, but as it advances to the ea&s;tward, &s;preads it&s;elf to a con&s;iderable di&s;tance; and &s;hews great remains. To the north &s;ide a large mole or bulwark ri&s;es on the vallum, and &s;eems to have been ca&s;t up by a&s;&s;ailants, to maintain an attack on the mount. There are con&s;iderable traces of a wide ditch on the out&s;ide of this vallum. On the we&s;t there are no other out-works, but the ground appears as if it might in former times be flooded, and thence the ca&s;tle rendered una&s;&s;ail|able on that part. From the mole and vallum la&s;t mentioned, there runs out to a con&s;iderable di&s;tance another vallum, &s;hewing great remains, and taking a large
<PB N="441" REF="516">&s;weep, terminating at the brook which runs on the &s;outh, and inclo&s;ing three or four acres of land; the outward vallum has a deep ditch, which, by receiving the waters of the brook, mu&s;t have afforded a very powerful defence. On this la&s;t vallum, to the north, and not far di&s;tant from that before noted, is another bul|wark or mole: we at fir&s;t con&s;idered tho&s;e eminences as the ruins of &s;ome gate|way towers, but on examining the approach, that idea was relinqui&s;hed.</P>
<P>CRAKE.</P>
<P>To the ea&s;t of Ea&s;ing wold about three miles, and twelve from York, lies Crake; the ca&s;tle, church, and village, &s;tand on the &s;ummit of a lofty eminence, ri&s;ing from an exten&s;ive plain, &s;teep and inacce&s;&s;ible on every &s;ide but on the &s;outh, where the approach is gradual. This little &s;hire is almo&s;t circular, the chief part lies to the north of the village. The ca&s;tle &s;tands on the very &s;ummit of the hill, the church to the &s;outh-ea&s;t, and from thence the village, with an open and &s;pacious area, lies on the &s;lope. Leland in his Itinerary gives this account, vol. I. p. 74: <Q>&startq;Then I &s;aw on the right hond, a 4 miles of, the ca&s;telle of Crek, gyven by King E$bright to St. Cuthbert. There remainith at this tyme &s;maul &s;hew of any old ca&s;tel that hath beene there. There is a haul, with other offices, and a great &s;table volrid with &s;tone, of a meatly anncyent building. The great &s;quar tower, that is thereby, as in the toppe of the hill, and &s;upplement of loggings, is very fair, and was erected totally by Neville, Bis&s;hop of Dure&s;me (reg. Hen. VI.) There is a park, the circuit of the lord&s;hip is 7 miles, and the value being a 40^li. &endq; by the yeare.</Q> On the point of the hill are the remains of &s;everal vaults, which now lie open; the principal one to the &s;outh has a pa&s;&s;age to a vault on the ea&s;t, greatly ruined, and one to the north, now perfect: it &s;eems that this &s;tructure had originally con&s;i&s;ted of four vaults, all dark, but communicating with one another: the centre was a kind of column, in which is a &s;tairca&s;e leading from the &s;uper|&s;tructure to the vaults; pa&s;&s;ing up the&s;e flairs, we a&s;cended into a &s;mall apartment or turret, with a &s;tone roof, of groined arching, having a circular opening in the centre: the re&s;t of the &s;uper&s;tructure is all gone, &s;o that it is impo&s;&s;ible to form any judgment what its original figure, or of what extent it was. About four&s;core yards from the&s;e remains, to the we&s;tward, and in &s;ome degree lower, is the &s;quare tower mentioned by Leland, placed on the edge of a precipice; but the hall, which we pre&s;umed by the ruins had &s;tood adjacent to the tower, is gone down; the tower, which forms an oblong &s;quare, fronting to the &s;outh, and built of durable free&s;tone, is now u&s;ed as a farm-hou&s;e; the walls are of a remarkable thickne&s;s, and the lower apartments &s;eem to have been con&s;tructed for pri&s;ons, and not as hou&s;ehold offices, though above ground. The pro&s;pect from this eminence is mo&s;t a&s;toni&s;hingly beautiful; we do not know of any thing like it in the northern parts of this kingdom: to the ea&s;tward it is for a &s;hort di&s;tance' confined by ri&s;ing grounds, but on every other quarter a level plain is extended to the eye above twenty miles; in which lies the city of York, to the &s;outh; with a multitude of towns and villages leathered round the Queen of the Vale, too numerous to be named here, as that would not be &s;o &s;atisfactory as ca&s;ting an eye on the map; the boundaries of the pro&s;pect to the north and north-we&s;t are the en$$ences which
<PB N="442" REF="517">ri&s;e behind Catterick, and adjoin to the openings of Wen&s;leydale and Swaledale, and extend towards Richmond, thence forming a chain which &s;tretches to the ea&s;t, and terminates the va&s;t land&s;cape: the whole plain con&s;i&s;ting of a country highly cultivated.</P>

There is a low &s;quare tower. In the corner, on the north &s;ide of the entrance into the chancel, is an altar tomb, with two recumbent e&s;&s;igies in alaba&s;ter, much mutilated, but &s;till di&s;covering elegant workman&s;hip. The male figure is without a helmet or cap of mail, the hair laid back in the front, and curled at the &s;ides, a beard, and the head re&s;ted on a cu&s;hion; a complete &s;uit of armour to the feet, the hands elevated, but now much broken, the &s;word on the left &s;ide, and a &s;hield on the left arm, bearing three bars, with a lion rampant over all. The female figure has a peaked coif &s;preading at the temples, and a large ruff, a dre&s;s perhaps more ancient than the time of Queen Elizabeth. There is no in&s;cription to denote the per&s;onages here interred. In a nich in the wall is a rude e&s;&s;igy of a female kneeling, much defaced and whitened over; the &s;trait bodice and &s;leeves, and high rolls on the &s;houlders, &s;hew this figure was of higher antiquity than the tomb before de&s;cribed: a bra&s;s tablet has been fixed in the adjoining wall, the nich remaining, but robbed of its ornament.</P>

<PB N="462" REF="538">&startq;and in armour, having the arms of Metham, and at the head of the monument a bird. The woman is al&s;o cro&s;s-legged. Around on the &s;ides of the monument are repre&s;ented twelve &s;everal children, &s;ome having books in &endq;their hands, others &s;crowls, and others birds.</Q> Mr. Gro&s;e, from Mr. Pennant's notes&mdash; <Q>On the floor is a fine tomb of a knight cro&s;s-legged, a &s;hield, a mantle, &startq;his neck and head bare, &s;hort hair. Mourners and religious in niches round the &endq;tomb; and one per&s;on with a falcon. A lady in a loo&s;e gown cro&s;s-legged.</Q> Mr. Gough, in the &s;uperb work, entitled "Funeral Monuments," p. 95, &s;ays, that "in a chapel adjoining to the quire" of this church <Q>is a lady of the family &startq;of Metham cro&s;s-legged." Again, "In a chapel on the &s;outh &s;ide of the ruined quire, a cro&s;s-legged knight, like Ro&s;s in the Temple church, in flowing hair, his head on a double cu&s;hion, his hands in mail banded at the wri&s;t, and a &s;leeve, a large &s;word at his left &s;ide, mail on his legs and feet, and &s;ingle &s;purs; a lion at his feet, on his long pointed &s;hield, quarterly mullet, in the fir&s;t quarter a fleur de lis, Or, Metham. By his &s;ide lies a woman, in a flowing coif, her &endq;right leg &s;eemed cro&s;&s;ed, but the figure is much damaged;</Q> and he then pro|ceeds to de&s;cribe the figures on the &s;ides of the altar part. We beg leave to add, that there is a rich canopy at the head of the knight, the &s;word lies at his left &s;ide &s;heathed, and the left leg is cro&s;&s;ed uppermo&s;t; the cap of mail is down in the neck like a hood, and the hands are elevated. The female figure is much mutilated, and to us did not &s;eem to have originally belonged to this tomb. John&s;on's MS. notes, <Q>Adjoining to the &s;outh wall lies the repre&s;entation of a &startq;man in armour cro&s;s-legged, with a dog lying at his feet, and on his &s;hield the arms of Saltmar&s;h." Mr. Pennant &s;ays, "Another cro&s;s-legged knight, his
<PB N="463" REF="539">head, cheeks, and neck guarded with chain armour, &s;ticking quite clo&s;e, a fillet round his head, his brea&s;t &s;et with ro&s;es." Mr. Gough's de&s;cription: "Under a &s;outh window is a knight on a &s;ingle cu&s;hion, in a round <HI>helmet</HI> of mail, with a plain fillet, a gorget of the &s;ame, al&s;o greaves and &s;hoe bands, &s;purs on both &endq;feet, a lion at the feet, a long &s;word, and on his &s;hield the arms of Saltmar&s;h.</Q> We mu&s;t add, that the hood of mail is put clo&s;e up, and bound with a fillet; he is covered with mail to the extremities, the right leg lies uppermo&s;t, the &s;word is &s;heathed, and hangs in the belt; the hands are elevated. Mr. John&s;on's drawing of the arms on the &s;hield gives it the bordeur, but there is not that addition: he gives nine cro&s;lets, and there are but &s;even on this &s;hield, placed 3, 1, 2, and 1. John&s;on's MS. proceeds, <Q>On another grave&s;tone is the figure of a man in &startq;armour, with four e&s;cocheons, all having the la&s;t-mentioned arms, and this &endq;in&s;cription round the &s;tone&mdash;"Orate pro aia Johannis Saltmar&s;h Armageri qui ob. 16&deg;.

<PB N="464" REF="540">to the arms of Metham there being added a chief; and the &s;ini&s;ter arms repre&s;ented a bend between two &s;plit eagles. Mr. Gough's account is accurate, In <Q>&startq;the &s;outh wall is a flowered arch, with a bouquet, &s;ided by Metham, and a &s;pread-eagle, &endq;debrui&s;ed by a bend.</Q> The effigy &s;poken of by John&s;on is gone; we were informed the boys of the &s;chool had broken it away, for the &s;ake of the alaba&s;ter; but rather pre&s;ume, that, to &s;ave it from being totally &s;poiled, the work|men clearing out the quire had removed it, and placed it on the tomb in the tran|&s;ept, where is a figure &s;et up again&s;t the pillar, repre&s;ented in a canonical habit, apparently not belonging to the tomb where it is placed. The MS. gives another epitaph from this porch, which we found cut in the black letter, on a large blue &s;tone, <Q>Hic jacet Thomas Metham, Miles, fil. Alexandri Metham et Anna que &startq;fuit uxor Tho. Metham, Militis, fil. Ri. Metham. Qui quidem Thomas Metham, Miles, fil. Alexandri Metham obiit in fe&s;to S. Annae, 26 Julij, A.

<PB N="465" REF="541">with an in&s;cription in the black letter all round the edge, which &s;eems to con&s;i&s;t of nothing but a repetition of "Thomas Metham." The burying ground and tombs of the&s;e ancient families are &s;uffered to remain uncovered, and be wantonly &s;poiled.&mdash;Leland in his Itinerary tells us&punc; that <Q>in the quire lyith one John of &startq;&endq;Hoveden, whom they call a Seinct, one as they &s;ay of the fir&s;t prebendaries there.</Q></P>
<P>We could gain no intelligence of the curious monument &s;poken of by Mr. Gough, and the ancient authors referred to by him. <Q>O&s;ara, &s;i&s;ter of King O&s;red, had in &startq;Hoveden church, York&s;hire, a tomb of wood&mdash;<HI>Tumba lignea in &s;edis modum &s;uper aram eminens.</HI> Girald. Camb. Itin. Camb. L. c. 1. p. 824. Funeral Monu|ments, p. 46." He lived about the year 1188. "In borealibus Angliae tran&s;|humbrorum finibus, in eccle&s;ia de Hoveden, rectoris eju&s;dem eccle&s;iae concubina, tumbae &s;anctae Ho&s;annae &s;ororis Regis O&s;raedi lignae in modum &s;edis &s;uper aram eminente, minus caute in&s;idit; quae cum recedere vellet, &s;ixis ligno natibus, evelli non potuit donec occurente populo, &s;ci&s;&s;is ve&s;tibus, et corpore nudato, et crebris di&s;ciplinis, u&s;que at &s;anguinis profluvium, acriter afflictes, cum lacrhimis quoque multis, et &s;upplicationibus, compunctione &s;ecuta, et penitentia injuncta, divinitus laxata rece&s;&s;it." Burton &s;ays, "After this manner were &s;ound the remains of &s;ome earthen pots in the quire of Hoveden church, under the &s;eats, having a hole open into the quire. The diameter of the mouth of one of the pots was five inches and a quarter, the whole diameter twelve inches, the bot|tom &endq;nine inches, depth &s;eventeen inches and a half.</Q> We lament that the de&s;cription of this curious monument clo&s;es there. Mo&s;t probable it belonged to the tomb of O&s;ara. No account could be had of it, when we vi&s;ited this church.</P>
<P>There are no tombs or in&s;criptions in the north porch of the quire. The chapter-hou&s;e adjoins to the &s;outh of the quire, with a little chapel, reve&s;try, or oratory, adjoining: the entrance under the third window, the door-way orna|mented with much carving in &s;tone; a nich on each &s;ide for a &s;tatue, canopied,
<PB N="466" REF="542">and the whole richly adorned with tabernacle work. Over the door of the little chapel, &amp;c. the arms of Skirlaw, Bi&s;hop of Durham. Mr. Pennant's notes, in Mr. Gro&s;e's work, <Q>Chapter-hou&s;e, a beautiful octagon, the tracery of the win|dows &startq;light and fine; the in&s;ide has thirty &s;talls, each under a Gothic arch; both the&s;e and the back of the &s;talls enriched with beautiful &s;culpture; over the door two rows of &s;ix niches each. The roof fallen in, through neglect, &endq;twenty years ago. Between the windows, on the out&s;ide, &s;everal &s;hields of arms.</Q> The chapter-hou&s;e, of eight equal &s;ides, is only eight paces in width; on each &s;ide of the door is a &s;eat, which, with four in each other front, make thirty in the whole; the &s;eats are &s;eparated by clu&s;tered pila&s;ters of various members, very &s;mall and extremely delicate, having foliated capitals of pierced work, and from thence ri&s;es rich tabernacle work, ornamenting a Gothic arch; the &s;eats are cano|pied, in imitation of a groined and ribbed arch, terminating in a knot in the centre; and the whole of the back of the &s;eats, up to the canopies, is carved in ro&s;e work. There are &s;even large windows, of three lights each, under pointed arches, with various tracery, light and elegant; the &s;pringings of the groins and ribs of a vaulted roof &s;till remain. Above the door are niches for &s;tatues, cano|pied and garni&s;hed with tabernacle work, two for &s;uperior per&s;onages in the centre, and two &s;maller on each &s;ide. The&s;e clo&s;e up the &s;pace which &s;hould have received the eighth window, if the chapter hou&s;e had been a detached build|ing: the tabernacle work, and ornaments of the door-way are elegant: the whole is built of a fine and durable free&s;tone; and, whil&s;t we confe&s;s it is the greate&s;t di&s;grace to &s;uffer this building to go to decay, we acknowledge that we have &s;een nothing in this i&s;land of &s;uch elegant work in &s;tone, except at Melro&s;s Abbey, in Scotland, with which this &s;mall building may ju&s;tly vie, and in one particular, it excells any part in the Scotch abbey, by its &s;ymmetry and exact proportion; be|ing the mo&s;t perfect example of Gothic architecture we ever &s;aw.</P>
<P>In the floor is a mutilated in&s;cription, on a chauntry prie&s;t of Thomas the martyr.</P>
<P>Had the pari&s;h officers laid out the money that was expended in con&s;tructing the pre&s;ent ve&s;try room, in repairs of this elegant building, appropriating it to that u&s;e, which we conceive would have been a very proper one, they would have demon&s;trated their ta&s;te to futurity, and pre&s;erved to the curious traveller the fine&s;t monument of antiquity in that part of the kingdom.</P>
<P>The out&s;ide of the quire has been of much more elegant workman&s;hip than the nave or tran&s;ept; the chapter-hou&s;e is &s;upported by a buttra&s;s at each corner, each ornamented with a nich for a &s;tatue, and a &s;hield of arms, the arms much defaced, three only to be made out with any degree of probability: the windows are or|namented with a border of tabernacle work. The ea&s;t end of the quire is remarkably beautiful, the annexed plate-will convey a ju&s;t idea, and &s;ave much de&s;cription: the &s;tation, from whence the drawing was made, gave a view of the tower, in a very picture&s;que &s;ituation. There are two fine &s;tatues yet remaining, one of St. Peter, the other &s;upporting a tabernacle, &s;uppo&s;ed to be St. Cuthbert, or Skirlaw, who did &s;o much at this edifice, and perhaps rebuilt the chancel, the niches and work of the ea&s;t end being greatly &s;imilar to the chapter-hou&s;e, which, there is &s;ufficient evidence, was built by him.</P>
<PB N="467" REF="543">
<P>The tran&s;ept is forty paces in length, and eight paces in width, lighted by a large window at each end, and two &s;ide windows to the we&s;t. The tower ri&s;es from pointed arches, &s;upported on clu&s;tered pillars. There are three door-ways which led into the quire, the fillets of the arches ornamented with ro&s;e work. On each &s;ide of the centre gate-way, which now leads into the ve&s;try, are four &s;tatues on pede&s;tals, the niches canopied and ornamented with tabernacle work; the figures to the north are habited like females, and perhaps were typical; the fir&s;t, with a book in the left hand, and a &s;croll falling to the feet in the right, the bot|tom &s;eized by a dove, an in&s;cription in the Saxon character<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Pennant, by following Leland implicitly, has been led into the &s;ame adoption.

We would add, that Kirkham died in 1260, when the Saxon character was chiefly in u&s;e; and Skirlaw, in 1405, when it was almo&s;t totally di&s;u&s;ed.</P>
<P>By the &s;outh-ea&s;t pillar of the &s;teeple, is a large altar-tomb, without any in&s;crip|tion, &s;culptured with eight &s;hields of arms, to the ea&s;t tho&s;e of Saltmar&s;h, which induces a belief, that it belonged to one of that family. In the floor, near this tomb, in the Saxon character, Hic jacet Emma de Cimiterio; on another, in the &s;ame character, Hic jacet Willielmus Maddi; another, Hic jacet **** de Nandon; another, hic jacet **** Ade, al&s;o the name John Pear&s;on.

<P>The nave, which, after the mode of &s;everal other di&s;&s;olved collegiate churches, is u&s;ed for divine &s;ervice, has two &s;ide ailes, and is forty paces in length, and twenty in width, including both ailes; the archings of the ea&s;t end of the ailes are u&s;ed for entrances; the centre arch is clo&s;ed up, for the place of the altar.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">There is a painting of the Lord's &s;upper fills the bows of the arch.</NOTE> The pillars forming the a$les are regular, five on each &s;ide, &s;upporting pointed arches; the columns are compo&s;ed of a clu&s;ter of four cilinders, each ribbed in front, the capitals octagonal, the arches of various members, and the whole light well pro|portioned and beautiful. The church is neatly &s;talled, and kept in good order; the nave is lighted by three windows to the we&s;t, the centre window of four lights; &s;ix windows to the north, and three to the &s;outh; two being clo&s;ed up by the &s;chool-hou&s;e, which is built again&s;t that front: they are all under pointed arches, and compo&s;ed of three lights each. The centre aile has a range of upper windows on each &s;ide, and an open gallery. There are &s;everal ancient tomb-&s;tones on the floor. Mr. Burton notes the following: <Q>In the nave, by the communion table, &startq;lies a white &s;tone, having a chalice engraven at the head and &s;ide, with this in|&s;cription, &endq;Hic jacet Johannes de Buckden vic. hujus Eccle&s;iae.</Q> Another in&s;cribed with the name of BRAKENDOLM in the Saxon character, and &s;everal other mutilared in&s;criptions. There were &s;everal paintings in the windows, perfect when Mr. Burton vi&s;ited; <Q>in the fir&s;t window of the &s;outh aile we&s;tward, quar|terly, &startq;fir&s;t and la&s;t barry of &s;ix O. and B.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">For &s;able.</NOTE> Con&s;table of Burton, &s;econd and third gules; a lion rampant argent.

The windows and door-ways of the we&s;t end, which Mr. Gro&s;e has delineated, are fini&s;hed with archings of many members, ari&s;ing from beautiful pila&s;ters; the centre and but|tra&s;&s;es terminating in lanthorn pinnacles, fini&s;hed with tabernacle work, which gives it a very uncommon appearance. In niches, there remain two &s;tatues, the one &s;upporting a tabernacle, both in good pre&s;ervation. The tower is a fine &s;truc|ture, compo&s;ed of durable &s;tone, not unlike the tower of Durham cathedral, but without the ornaments; &s;aid to be 128 feet in height:<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">We pre&s;ume this height is given of the tower only, where it ri&s;es from the roof of the church.</NOTE> in order to render it con|&s;picuous at a great di&s;tance, the pari&s;hioners are at the expence of &s;couring the out&s;ide; a work which &s;everal people were employed in, &s;u&s;pended in cradles, when we &s;aw it.

<P>King William the Conqueror gave to the Bi&s;hop of Durham this his royal manor and town of Hemingburgh, and the church thereof, together with all his land at Brakenholme, with all tho&s;e royal cu&s;toms and liberties, which it formerly had, when To&s;tins and Siward held it: to be holden of the king in capite. <HI>Mon. Angl.</HI> vol. I. p. 45. Thus the bi&s;hop being &s;eized of it, granted three carucates of land in the town to the prior and convent of Durham, to be holden de rege in capite.

<P>This church, which was then a great rectory, was al&s;o given to the &s;aid prior and convent, and their &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, who have ever &s;ince been patrons of it. On 19th July, 1356, this pari&s;h church was appropriated to the prior and convent of Durham, (of who&s;e patronage it was) by John, Archbi&s;hop of York, who, in re|compence of the damage the church of York had &s;u&s;tained thereby, re&s;erved out of the fruits thereof, to him and his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors archbi&s;hops, an annual pen&s;ion of 66 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> 8 <ABBR>d.</ABBR> and to the dean and chapter of York, another annual pen&s;ion of 3 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> 6 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> 8 <ABBR>d.</ABBR> to be paid by the &s;aid prior and convent for ever. On the 21&s;t day of July, 1356, the archbi&s;hop ordained a perpetual vicarage in this pari&s;h church, appointing the vicar thereof to be at the pre&s;entation of the prior and convent of Durham, who &s;hould &s;et out for his habitation a competent hou&s;e, with its curtelage and garden, near the &s;aid church, and pay him and his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors 40 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> &s;terling per ann. at Martinmas and Penteco&s;t, by equal portions; in re&s;pect of which he &s;hall bear all burthens, ordinary incumbent on the church, excepting the building or repairs of the quire; and all other extraordinary duties, which the &s;aid prior and convent &s;hould bear. <HI>Mon.

But notwith|&s;tanding all this, as it &s;eems the &s;aid ordination was invalid, and the king's licence granted thereupon was never executed, by rea&s;on that the prior and convent of Durham could not procure the pope's confirmation; and that certain other per|&s;ons, from time to time, had the &s;aid church in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, by virtue of the provi|&s;ions from the apo&s;tolic fee. <HI>Mon.

<P>Of &s;pars there is great variety. Of the opaque, which is rhomboidal, hexan|gular. triangular, or gobular, and of various colours, found in the lead mines, and of the diaphonous, which is rhomboidal, triangular, hexangular, pyramidal, or columnar, al&s;o found in the lead mines.

<P>In &s;everal &s;tones in Mr. Dixon's po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion at Cockfield are the impre&s;&s;ions of ferns and other plants; in one an American fern, in high relief; they are found in the nodules of iron &s;tone by the miners called <HI>Cat&s;heads,</HI> and in other lumps of dark blue &s;tone; they &s;plit with a &s;light &s;troke, at the very place or bed of the plant, after being expo&s;ed to the winter, and &s;hew the vegetable lineaments in great beauty. The impre&s;&s;ion of the American fern is remarkable, from having &s;ome of the leaves compre&s;&s;ed and bent back.</P>
<P>Large trees have been found in the mora&s;&s;es, of different kinds, rendered very hard, and pre&s;erved perfectly &s;ound by the a&s;tringent quality of the mo&s;s water.&mdash;Hazel nuts, acorns, and ma&s;t of firs, are found in the peats, which are cut and &s;old for fuel. On the &s;ea &s;hore, near Seaton, within watermark, known by the ancient name of Seaton pa&s;ture, large trees are found bedded in the clay and mo&s;s earth there. The trees thus found are &s;eldom di&s;covered with roots; which gives an apprehen&s;ion that they were burnt down.</P>
<P>Several kinds of vegetable &s;ub&s;tances are found petrified, or incru&s;ted with calcareous matter in the dropping &s;prings at Sledwi&s;h, near Barnard Ca&s;tle, &s;imi|lar to tho&s;e found at Knare&s;borough, in York&s;hire.</P>
<P>In the free&s;tone quarries at Durham, which were wrought for &s;tones for the new bridge, was found an entire fi&s;h, in figure like the bream, embodied in a large block of &s;tone&mdash;in &s;eparating it, the fins and tail were broken off.</P>

<P>The mines of coal and lead are &s;ubjects worthy of our chief attention, and of
<PB N="494" REF="570">great importance in the county of Durham. The u&s;e of coal was for &s;everal ages paid little attention to, from the di&s;agreeable &s;tench and &s;moak which it produced, where chimneys were not properly adapted, and whil&s;t wood was abundant in the country. It has been the opinion of &s;ome learned writers, that the working of coal was of higher antiquity, than the time of the Romans in Britain; and that it was the object of Briti&s;h commerce &s;oon after their arrival, and this idea &s;eems to be founded chiefly on the circum&s;tance, that in the di&s;covery of hippocau&s;ts and vaults, where remains of &s;acrifice have been found, attributed to the Romans, there were appearances of the refu&s;e of coal &s;ires, and in digging up the foundations of <HI>Caervorran,</HI> on the wall, in 1762, coal cinders were found, which &s;till burnt in the fire: but tho&s;e evidences are not conclu&s;ive, for it is certain, the walled forts of the Romans were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by various &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, and they in later ages might u&s;e coals. True it is, the Saxons and Danes were bu&s;ied in warfare, yet their dome&s;tic occa&s;ions would lead them to &s;o very u&s;eful an article as coal, which they would di&s;cover, in many places, where the veins break out to the day, &s;hewing them|&s;elves in the &s;trata of cliffs and precipices. We are not told where the &s;eams of coal were fir&s;t wrought to any con&s;iderable degree, and perhaps in Durham and Northumberland mining did not advance rapidly till after the fourteenth century; for in the reign of King Edward III. the governor of Berwick was obliged to &s;end for men &s;killed in mining from the fore&s;t of Dean, and the more &s;outhern parts, to a&s;&s;i&s;t him in retaking that town from the Scotch.</P>
<P>Mr. Hor&s;ley, treating of the in&s;criptions found at Benwell, &s;ays, <Q>there is a &startq;colliery not far from that place, a part of which is judged by tho&s;e be&s;t&s;killed &endq;in &s;uch affairs, to have been wrought by the Romans.</Q> We &s;hould be glad to know how a proper di&s;tinction can be made, by which to determine what is Briti&s;h, Roman, or Saxon work, without &s;ome in&s;truments were found in the workings, to denote the people. Cae&s;ar, in what he writes of the Natural Hi&s;tory of Britain, only &s;ays, <Q>The inland countries afford tin, and the maritime iron, &startq;&endq;though no great plenty of it.</Q> We may naturally deduce from thence, that the inhabitants he &s;ound, even on the &s;hores, did not burn coal. In the corre&s;pon|dence between Sir John Clerk and Roger Gale, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> on this &s;ubject, we find &s;eve|ral remarks worth tran&s;mitting to the reader. Sir John, in his letter of the 8th Dec. 1739, from Edenburg, addre&s;&s;ed to Mr. Gale, &s;ays, <Q>Being a coal-ma&s;ter &startq;of near forty years experience, our philo&s;ophical &s;ociety expects a di&s;&s;ertation from me on coals, &amp;c. I found that Sir Robert Atkins's a&s;&s;ertion of coal being to be &s;een round the world, by a line from the mouth of Severn to Newca&s;tle, is mentioned (Hi&s;t. of Glouce&s;ter&s;hire, p. 30) in the fourth iter of your friend Dr. Stukeley's Itin. Curios. p. 60; and that the &s;trata of coal are found and wrought in the bi&s;hoprick of Liege, and pa&s;&s;ed we&s;tward by Great Britain and Ireland. As to the coal in China, the ab&s;tract we have of the mi&s;&s;ionaries letters, vol. I. p. 22, takes notice, that no country in the world abounds more with coal, but I &s;uppo&s;e they mean only the north of China, &s;o that indeed coal does &s;eem to be the product of a northern climate, from perhaps, 46 to the; 6th de|gree of latitude; &s;o far has nature provided again&s;t cold. I have heard of coal &endq;in the north of America, but have never &s;een any printed account of it.</Q> Mr.
<PB N="495" REF="571">Gale's an&s;wer, dated from Scruton, 26th Feb. 1739-40, &s;ays, <Q>This is a &s;ubject &startq;&s;carcely yet touched, though &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to be under&s;tood: I know of no author that has expre&s;sly handled it; Dr. Plott, indeed, in his Hi&s;tory of Stafford&s;hire, and Mr. Robin&s;on, in his Natural Hi&s;tory of We&s;tmorland and Cumberland, have &s;omething of it, but &s;uperficial, with poor rea&s;oning in their philo&s;ophy. The la&s;t account that I have met with of this nature, is given by Mr. Strachy, in the Philo&s;ophical Tran&s;actions, No. 360 and 391. As to the antiquity of working coal about Newca&s;tle, the inte&s;tine wars among the Britons and Saxons and afterwards of the Saxons among them&s;elves, which were almo&s;t continual, be&s;ides the inva&s;ions of the Danes, and the wars with Scotland for three or four reigns after the Norman conque&s;t, during which time this country, as may be &s;aid, was always under fire and &s;word, together with its never being mentioned in hi&s;tory, makes me think it was not followed, till about the time of Henry III. The fir&s;t mention I have &s;een of coal-working there, is in a hi&s;tory of the town of Newca&s;tle, publi&s;hed in the year 1736, p. 158, where it is &s;aid they had a grant from Hen. III. to dig coals in Ca&s;tlefield and the Frith, dated in the 23d year of his reign, A. D. 1239. <HI>Carbomarinus</HI> is al&s;o mentioned by Matthew Paris, A. D. 1245; but the working of coal may have been much earlier in other parts of this kingdom, a flint ax having been found in &s;ome veins of coal, expo&s;ed to &s;ight in a rock, called <HI>Craig-y-Park,</HI> in Monmouth&s;hire; which, as they laid open to-day, might very well be di&s;covered and wrought by the people that u&s;ed &s;uch tools, the ancient Britons, as I &s;uppo&s;e. The counties in Eng|land producing coal, are Cumberland, We&s;tmorland, Northumberland, Durham, York&s;hire, chiefly the We&s;t Riding, Lanca&s;hire, Che&s;hire, Derby&s;hire, Notting|ham&s;hire, Leice&s;ter&s;hire, Stafford&s;hire, Shrop&s;hire, Worce&s;ter&s;hire, Glouce&s;ter|&s;hire, Somer&s;et&s;hire, North and South Wales. As the &s;trata of coal generally lie bedded between two other &s;trata of &s;tone, and ri&s;e and dip in parallel lines with them, they &s;eem to me coeval with the texture of the globe, and to have undergone the &s;ame concu&s;&s;ions that it has &s;uffered; it being hard to conceive, how &s;oft earth, included between two &s;uch &s;olid bodies, &s;hould imbibe a &s;ulphu|reous or bituminous matter, from, or through them: there is, indeed, &s;uch a &s;ulphureous matter found in the coal-works; but to me it appears much more rea&s;onable to think it was &s;hut up at the &s;ame time with other &s;ub&s;tances, than enter into the compo&s;ition of coal. The &s;trata of coal &s;eem to lie within a very &s;mall compa&s;s on the globe. I have met with an ob&s;ervation, that if a line is drawn from the mouth of Severn to Newca&s;tle, and &s;o round the earth, that all coal will be found to lie within a very &s;mall di&s;tance of it, on one &s;ide or other: but the ob&s;ervation is erroneous. The coal &s;ound in Europe, at lea&s;t, the furthe&s;t di&s;tant ea&s;tward, is, I believe about Liege, and we&s;tward in the mountains of Kilkenny in Ireland, both within 250 miles of it: but I think there was no occa&s;ion to &s;tretch the line round the world; for all the coal we know of is contained within the latitudes of our own i&s;land, except what I re|member to have heard affirmed &s;ome years ago in the Hou&s;e of Commons, upon the debate about the bill of commerce with France, &s;hould prove me mi&s;taken, by which the I&s;le of Cape Briton was given up to that crown, and &s;aid to abound with excellent coal; but as I could never &s;ince meet with a confirmation
<PB N="496" REF="572">of the a&s;&s;ertion, I mu&s;t que&s;tion the truth of it. I cannot &s;ay any thing as to coal being the common fuel of China,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sir Hans Sloan &s;ays in his Voyage to Jamaica, that there is a kind of fine coal in Barbadoes, and in his return, that they took a French &s;hip bound to Canada for coals.
<P>The Iri&s;h mines lately di&s;covered, if the relation is true, appear to be very ancient; but we do not confide in the account.</P></NOTE> not having the Mi&s;&s;ionary Letters by me, or read that book. There is a tradition at London, that Blackheath, above Greenwich, is full of coal, but not permitted to be wrought, for the encourage|ment of navigation and the Newca&s;tle trade, which, I dare &s;ay, is fal&s;e; this I am &s;ure of, that there is no law again&s;t it; and though the heath belongs to the crown, and no king gave leave to dig it, yet it is &s;trange, that none of the neighbouring land-owners &s;hould ever be allured by the va&s;t profits it would bring them, to &s;earch for coal, and work it there, when found in their own e&s;tates. I &s;uppo&s;e the act of Henry V. you hint at, is that in his 9th year, for 2d. a-chaldron of coals, to be paid by &s;uch as are not infranchi&s;ed, and for the mea&s;urement of keels. The author of the Newca&s;tle hi&s;tory &s;ays, that in the 1&s;t of Edward iii's &s;tatutes, mention is made, de Carbonibus maritimis, but I can|not find it in any of our &s;tatute books, though I have the fir&s;t that was ever &endq;printed.</Q></P>
<P>The u&s;e of coals prevailed in London in the latter end of the reign of King Edward I. <Q>when brewers, dyers, and other artificers, u&s;ing great fires, began to &startq;u&s;e &s;ea coal, in&s;tead of dry wood and charcoal, in and near the city of London; the prelates, nobles, commons, and other people of the realm, re&s;orting thither to parliaments, and upon other occa&s;ions with the inhabitants of the city, South|wark, Wapping, and Ea&s;t Smithfield, complained thereof twice, one after ano|ther, to the king, as a public nui&s;ance, corrupting the air with &s;tink and &s;moke, to the great prejudice and detriment of their health; whereupon the king fir&s;t prohibited burning of &s;ea coal by his proclamation, which being di&s;obeyed by many of their private lucre; the king, upon their &s;econd complaint, i&s;&s;ued a com|mi&s;&s;ion of oyer and terminer, to enquire of all &s;uch who burned &s;ea coal again&s;t his proclamation within the &s;aid city, or parts adjoining to it, and to puni&s;h them, for the fir&s;t offence, by great fines and ran&s;oms; and for the &s;econd offence, to demoli&s;h their furnaces and kilns wherein they burnt &s;ea coal, and to &s;ee his proclamation &s;trictly ob&s;erved for times to come, (though &s;ince it is the fuel principally u&s;ed by them, and all &s;orts of per&s;ons in and near the city, and el&s;e|where, and is no ways reputed a public nui&s;ance) as this record in 35th Edward &endq;I. informs us.</Q> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Prynn's Animadver&s;ions on Cooke's In&s;titutes.&mdash;In 1379, we find that their u&s;e was not only tole|rated, but their con&s;umption made beneficial to the &s;tate; for in that year, a duty of &s;ixpence per ten, each quarter of a year, wa$ impo&s;ed on &s;hips coming from Newca&s;tle.&mdash;PENNANT, vol.

<P>It is impo&s;&s;ible to obtain any calculation, what quantity of coals are entered at the port of Newca&s;tle, from the works in the county of Durham, they are received by the officers there indi&s;criminately; about &s;ixty-two thou&s;and Newca&s;tle chal|drons of coals are yearly received at Derwent Haugh, to work, lead, and deliver which, upwards of &s;ix hundred men and boys are employed, and about four hun|dred hor&s;es, together with two hundred keelmen, to navigate them down the river to the &s;hipping.

The waggons proceed to the &s;taiths or repo&s;itories at the water &s;ide, where a platform of timber is con&s;tructed to receive them, and the bottom of the vehicle, which is &s;itted as a door, with hinges on one &s;ide, and a ha&s;p on the other, to fa&s;ten it to the &s;ole of the waggon, being opened or let down, the load is in&s;tantly di&s;char|ged, either into keels below, or into the &s;taith, where they lie under cover, and are ready to be ca&s;t into the keels, when the tide or trade does not &s;uit the arrival of the waggons from the remoter collieries.

<P>Of the lead won in this part of the county, we have obtained the following account:&mdash;A bing of ore is 8 cwt. and upon an average 4 &frac14; bings, or 34 cwt. of ore will produce 21 cwt. of lead.&mdash;A fother of lead at Newca&s;tle is 21 cwt. and will produce &s;even, eight, nine, and &s;ometimes ten ounces of &s;ilver; but if it yields under &s;even ounces and a half, or eight ounces, it will not pay the expence of refining, when lead is 16 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> the fother.&mdash;The &s;trata or bearing &s;ills are various, which carry ore, the grey po&s;t bears well, but the be&s;t is the great lime&s;tone, both for quantity and quality; which is about 70 fathoms in thickne&s;s.

On the &s;ides of the vien, and among&s;t the chiver, are often found foules of a tran&s;parent nature, and other matter of a chry&s;taline quality, &s;ome of which, on a chemical proce&s;s, produce ar&s;enic.&mdash; Ore, upon an average, is won for about 20 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> a bing.</P>
<P>The wharfs at Stella and Bladon receive the greate&s;t part of the lead which comes down the Tyne. The proprietors are the London company, called the Quakers' company, the heirs of Sir Thomas Blacket, Bart. and Henry Errington, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> and company.&mdash;The &s;melt mills are chiefly on Derwent river, at Whitfield, Jeffreys, and Acton, belonging to the London company; Dukesfield, Allonheads, and Rookhope, belonging to the heirs of Sir Thomas Blacket; and Feldon, nigh Edmundbyers, belonging to Mr. Erring|ton, &amp;c. Sir Thomas's heirs have a refinery at Bladon.&mdash; The yearly receipt of lead, on an average, at the above wharfs, is &s;ixty thou&s;and pieces, of twelve &s;tone each, or thereabout.&mdash;There are about ninety-three hor&s;e carriages con&s;tantly employed to bring down the lead, each carrying ten pieces at a time.</P>
<P>Dr. Wat&s;on, in his Chemical E&s;&s;ays, vol. III. has given an accurate account of the methods, both ancient and modern, of &s;melting lead ore, and extracting the &s;ilver, as al&s;o the proce&s;s of preparing white and redlead, to which we mu&s;t refer the reader, as an abridgement would not be doing ju&s;tice to the learned author.</P>
<P>In the year 1775, 697,608 chaldrons of coals were imported in the port of London from Newca&s;tle and Sunderland, which was 37,237 chaldrons more than in the year 1773, and 77,237 chaldrons more than in the year 1774. In the year 1776, 600,000 chaldrons were imported at London. The average number of pieces of lead which are &s;ent to Bladon, from the we&s;tern mines in the county of Durham, is about 100,000, and about 30,000 more come to Swall-well, Newca&s;tle, &amp;c. chiefly from this county. The chief articles of produce of this county, exported from Newca&s;tle, are coals, lead, and grind&s;tones, and of the manufactories of iron, tho&s;e we have &s;tated for one year, in a table given in the notes.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><LIST>

<P><Q>&startq;No accounts are kept at the cu&s;tom-hou&s;e, di&s;tingui&s;hing the importation from Newca&s;tle, Sunderland, Blythe, Hartlepool, &amp;c. or from &s;everal parts in Scotland and Wales. It appears, from the preceding account, that in the year 1777, there were imported into the port of London 697,435 chalders, and we learn from another authority (<HI>ann. reg.</HI> 1777, ch. 161) that in the &s;ame year there were imported from Newca&s;tle and Sunderland alone 692,093 &frac34; chalders; by comparing the&s;e numbers, we may ob&s;erve how &s;mall a portion of the coal &endq;con&s;umed in London is brought from any other quarter.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;A chalder of coals, Newca&s;tle mea&s;ure, is allowed by act of parliament (6th and 7th William and Mary, ch. 10) to weigh fifty-three hundred weight; and as eight Newca&s;tle chalders are equal to fifteen London chalders, reckoning thirty-&s;ix Winche&s;ter bu&s;hels to the London chalder, it follows, that a chalder of coals, London mea&s;ure, is equal to little more than twenty-eight hundred weight. By &s;uppo&s;ing twenty-eight hundred weight to be the weight of a London chalder&mdash;then, as the medium quantity of coal annually imported into London is 658,853 chalders, it may be collected, that there are annually &endq;imported 922,394 tons.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;The medium weight of a cubic foot of the &s;everal coals (&s;pecified in a table) being 1336 averdupois ounces, a cubic yard, or twenty-&s;even cubic feet of coal, will weigh 2254 &frac12; averdupois pounds; there are 2240 &s;uch pounds in a ton; hence we may &s;ay in general, that a cubic yard of pit coal weighs a ton; &s;ome &s;orts of coal weigh a few pounds more, and others a few pounds le&s;s than a ton. From what has been before ob&s;erved, concerning the quantity of coal annually imported into London, we may conclude, that 922,394 cubic yards of coal are annually dug out of the earth for the &s;upply of the London market. This quantity of coal, if &s;pread to the thickne&s;s of an inch, would cover an area of &endq;above ten miles &s;quare.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;The great Ho&s;fman had given it as his opinion, that the <HI>peripneumony,</HI> the dry <HI>a&s;thma,</HI> and the <HI>con&s;umption,</HI> were common maladies among&s;t the inhabitants
<PB N="501" REF="577">of Liege and London, and that they were occa&s;ioned by the great u&s;e of pit coal in tho&s;e places. M. Morand, in 1769, was at the trouble to inquire into this matter, and it appears, from the atte&s;tations of the College of Phy&s;icians in Lon|don, of the Faculty of Medicine at Paris, of the Phy&s;icians at Liege, at Lyons, and other places, that the opinion concerning the peculiar in&s;alubrity of pit coal &endq;fires is utterly without foundation.</Q></P>
<P>We mu&s;t not quit the &s;ubject without noticing the <HI>fire-damps</HI> which affect the mines: no &s;ecurity has yet been di&s;covered again&s;t this tremendous phenomenon, in the&s;e parts; in the deep workings at Whitehaven they have practi&s;ed &s;everal inventions; Mr. Pennant, who vi&s;ited the mines, &s;peaks of them in this manner: <Q>&startq;The fire-damps, formerly &s;o dangerous, are almo&s;t overcome; at pre&s;ent they are prevented by boarded partitions, placed a foot di&s;tant from the &s;ides, which cau&s;es a free circulatlon of air throughout: but as &s;till there are &s;ome places not capable of &s;uch conveniences, the colliers who dare not venture with a candle, in &s;pots where fire-damps are &s;uppo&s;ed to lurk, have invented a curious machine to &s;erve the purpo&s;e of lights: it is what they call a &s;teel-mill, con&s;i&s;ting of a &s;mall wheel and a handle; this they turn with va&s;t rapidity again&s;t a flint, and the great quantity of &s;parks emitted not only &s;erves for a candle, but has been found of &s;uch a nature, as not to &s;et fire to the horrid vapour. Formerly the damp or fiery vapour was conveyed through pipes to the open air, and formed a terrible illumination during night, like the irruptions of a volcano; and by its heat water could be boiled: the men who worked in it inhaled inflammable air, and if they breathed again&s;t a candle, puffed out a fiery &s;tream; &s;o that I make no doubt, were the experiment made, that the &s;ame phenomenon would appear as John &endq;Grubb attributed to my illu&s;trious countryman, Pendragon, chief of Britons.</Q> Per&s;ons &s;killed in the coal-works in this county, allege that the &s;teel-mill is no &s;ecurity again&s;t the inflammable gas, as woeful experience has too frequently proved. Tho&s;e who have &s;een the fire-damps circulating in the workings of mines, de&s;cribe it to be like the curling and undulating of &s;moke pa&s;&s;ing along the roof: a particular appearance on the top of the candle, where it gathers, if diligently atten|ded to, is the mo&s;t certain criterion by which the approach of that dreadful vapour is di&s;covered. Several explo&s;ions by this inflammable vapour have happened in this century, but in the year 1708, the mo&s;t con&s;iderable one of the century. On Tue&s;day morning, the 17th of Augu&s;t, about three o'clock, a terrible blow was heard, proceeding from the neighbourhood of Che&s;ter in the Street, as loud and horrible as if a magazine of gun powder had taken fire, yet of a deader and flatter found; the report was heard remarkably loud, at the di&s;tance of &s;ix miles. It was &s;oon known that the noi&s;e proceeded from an explo&s;ion of the coal mines near Lumley; no account of previous circum&s;tances could be obtained, not one per&s;on &s;urviving that was at work at the time. It was conjectured, that upon working the coals, &s;ome cavity was opened where this magazine of de&s;truction lay, which, getting pa&s;&s;age, broke out with dreadful fury at the mouths of the pits. The number of people, which the overmen &s;aid were at work, amounted to ninety &s;ouls at lea&s;t; if any &s;urvived the bla&s;t, they died in the chambers of the mine, for no one dur&s;t venture down to relieve them; and no ve&s;&s;el could be let down, the
<PB N="502" REF="578">mouths of the pits, or &s;hafts were &s;o &s;haken and fallen in: about eight or nine bodies were found on the &s;urface, but all of them blown to pieces, &s;ome wanting the head, and others the limbs: one carca&s;e was blown &s;o directly from the &s;haft, which was fifty fathom deep, that it was found at a prodigious di&s;tance; how high it might be thrown into the air, not to be calculated. The violence of the &s;hock was &s;uch, that &s;everal hou&s;es at a good di&s;tance from the place, were &s;hattered with the force of it, and the gin which wrought with hor&s;es, was &s;hattered to pieces, and &s;cattered abroad at a great di&s;tance.</P>
<P>The fire-engine is now greatly improved, and not only employed to draw water from the mines, but al&s;o to work ventilators, and draw the coals. The depth and various &s;trata of the coal mines, near the Tyne and Wear, are be&s;t de&s;cribed by the annexed plates, the accuracy of which may be depended on. Walker colliery on the north of Tyne, is one hundred fathom in dephth, and the &s;eam five feet five inches and a half in thickne&s;s.&mdash;At Long Benton, the mine called the Ba&s;on, is &s;eventy-two fathoms in depth, and the main &s;eam is about &s;even feet in thickne&s;s; the other mine there, called the Delight, is &s;eventy-four feet three inches in depth, and the main &s;eam is &s;even feet in thickne&s;s,&mdash;New Benton coalliery is &s;eventy fathom in depth, and the coal &s;even feet in thickne&s;s.&mdash;Byker mine is about &s;eventy fathom deep, and the coal five feet ten inches thick: within two feet of the roof, is a band or load of &s;tone, which reduces the coal &s;eam to five feet nine inches.&mdash;In an adjoining mine there is a dyke, lying north-we&s;t and &s;outh-ea&s;t; many &s;mall branches run from it, re&s;embling the root of a tree, in various directions. The&s;e coal-&s;eams generally ri&s;e to the north-we&s;t, and dip to the &s;outh-ea&s;t.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the fulminating vapour, there is another pernicious one in the&s;e works, which is ar&s;enical, gro&s;s and foul, not &s;uffering the candles to burn, and killing the workmen in&s;tantly by its pernicious nature. A per&s;on who was &s;uffocated by this vapour, was recovered by being laid on his belly, with his mouth put to a hole cut in the earth; which, it is &s;aid, is the u&s;ual remedy on &s;uch occa&s;ions.</P>
<P><Q>&startq;In the grounds at Benwell, about a quarter of a mile north from the river Tyne, a coal mine took fire at a workman's candle, negligently placed, and con|tinued burning about thirty years, though at fir&s;t &s;o &s;mall, that a propo&s;al was made to put it out, for &s;o low a reward as 2 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> 6 <ABBR>d.</ABBR> but it was not accepted. It afterwards acquired &s;uch force and &s;trength, that it raged with fury, in vari|ous directions and depths; &s;ometimes taking its cour&s;e ea&s;t and we&s;t, and at la&s;t to the north, into the grounds of <HI>Fenham,</HI> near a mile from its fir&s;t appearance, committing great ravages in its way, only con&s;picuous by its flames and columns of &s;moak in the night. The irruptions at Fenham were in near twenty places. I have not heard that it ca&s;t forth &s;tones of any con&s;iderable magnitude. Flowers of &s;ulphur, mixed with &s;al ammoniac, were found concreted on pieces of allum-&s;tone, &s;late, and the neighbouring furze, of which a phy&s;ician of New|ca&s;tle upon Tyne gave an account to the Royal Society. (Ph. Tr. No. 130) He could di&s;cover neither common &s;alt nor nitre in the &s;oil or &s;prings about it, the coal-water being all vitrioline, and tinged red with galls, and other neigh|bouring fountains being de&s;titute of mineral &s;alts. But he ob&s;erved, that the coal-ways were mended with a &s;ort of &s;late, compo&s;ed of coal, allum-&s;tone, and
<PB N="503" REF="579">marca&s;ite, ca&s;t in heaps and burnt, from which he often collected both brim|&s;tone and &s;al ammoniac. Some of the &s;alt ejected by this bituminous vol|cano was upwards of &s;ix miles broad. It was fir&s;t ob&s;erved and gathered by Dr. Gilpin, and, by experiment, proved to be &s;al ammoniac. In colour, &s;ome of it was grey, &s;ome &s;now white, freed from the black <HI>faetor</HI> of the coal, by the &endq;inten&s;e heat of the fire.</Q> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Wallis.</NOTE></P>
<P>The like circum&s;tances were mentioned to the author, when he vi&s;ited Whick|ham, to have taken place in that neighbourhood.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See notes to p. 450. vol. II.</NOTE></P>
<P>The coal mines were &s;ingularly pre&s;erved from de&s;truction, on two occa&s;ions, which are mentioned in Whitlock's Memoirs. In the 19th year of King Charles I. 1643, they were ordered by the Marquis of Newca&s;tle to be fired, when the king's forces were be&s;ieged in Newca&s;tle by the Scotch; Le&s;ley, the Scotch General, pre&s;erved them by &s;urpri&s;ing the boats and ve&s;&s;els, that were ordered on that ex|pedition. In 1648, the Scotch in their turn, under their General Monroe, had projected the like mi&s;chief, but receiving intelligence, that the Marquis of Argyle, with a large party of their countrymen, was in arms again&s;t them, they fled pre|cipitately over the Tweed, and with difficulty carried off their baggage and plunder.</P>
<P>The coals are of various colours and figure.&mdash;The fir&s;t to be ob&s;erved, the miners call <HI>Splint,</HI> hard, glo&s;&s;y, and got in large ma&s;&s;es, preferable to all others for &s;trength and duration.&mdash;Another with a thick enamel of &s;ilvery marca&s;ite.&mdash;A third which carries the colours of the rainbow, in a beautiful enamel, much ex|ceeding what is found in the lead ore, and more permanent, if pre&s;erved under a cover, dry and clear of du&s;t. Some has a high natural poli&s;h like a mirror; and many &s;pecimens break in rhomboidal and parallelapiped figures. Canal-coal is found in &s;mall quantities.</P>
<P>Of the various phaenomena in nature, we find &s;ome particularly curious in the neighbourhood of Cockfield, communicated by the learned naturali&s;t and mathe|matician, Mr. George Dixon, who&s;e re&s;earches into the bo&s;om of the earth have been great, in his profe&s;&s;ion of a coalworker. The annexed plans are engraved from drawings by Mr. Dixon; the fir&s;t of which exhibits a &s;pecimen of a break in the &s;trata occa&s;ioned by tho&s;e concu&s;&s;ions &s;o &s;cientifically treated of by Mr. John Whitehur&s;t in his <HI>Inquiry into the original State and Formation of the Earth.</HI><NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Publi&s;hed 1778, London.</NOTE> In the &s;pecimen here exhibited, we &s;ee a fragment in the form of a wedge, occa&s;ioned by that part dropping down from the regular &s;hell; or, by the di&s;tended &s;hell be|ing torn from the wedge, and bulged upwards. Such mighty convul&s;ions, perhaps, fir&s;t rai&s;ed the i&s;land of Great Britain from the ocean, or &s;evered it from the Gallic &s;hores.</P>

The other plate exhibits a dyke, which appears on the
<PB N="505" REF="581">&s;urface on Cockfield Fell. Mr. Whitehur&s;t &s;peaking of a &s;pecies of &s;tone, which he calls Toad&s;tone, and by its de&s;cription, p. 162, &s;imilar to the &s;ub&s;tance which forms the dyke, &s;ays, <Q>It is perfectly &s;imilar to Iceland Lava in its appearance and &startq;chemical quality, and that it frequently fills up the fi&s;&s;ures in the &s;tratum under|neath it, more or le&s;s, as they are more or le&s;s wide: all (the enumerated circum|&s;tances) plainly evince, that Toad&s;tone was formed by a very different law from the others, and greatly po&s;terior to them; for the beds of lime&s;tone mu&s;t have been formed before they were broken, and broken before their fi&s;&s;ures could have been filled up; therefore we may, with much rea&s;on, conclude, that toad&s;tone, channel, &amp;c. is actually lava, and flowed from a volcano, who&s;e funnel or &s;haft did not approach the open air, but di&s;gorged its fiery contents between the &s;trata in all directions. Another remarkable phenomenon accompanying the Derby&s;hire lava, is, that the &s;tratum of clay, &amp;c. is apparently burnt, as much as an earthen pot or brick, &amp;c. The &s;tratum of clay is about four feet thick, and thus burnt about one foot deep. The circum&s;tances &s;hew, that the po&s;i|tion of the &s;trata was altered by the convul&s;ion which occa&s;ioned the fracture; from whence we may infer, they had originally an uniform arrangement, con|centric &endq;to the centre of the earth.</Q> By the reader's referring to the work it|&s;elf, many circum&s;tances will be obtained to explain and elucidate the plan before us. Mr. Dixon's account of the phenomenon is &s;hortly this, <Q>That the dyke &startq;which runs through Cockfield colliery, runs ea&s;tward to Buckheads, Bolam, Legs Cro&s;s, and &s;o below Yarm, to Aigton in Cleveland; it has not been traced far to the north-we&s;t, into the lead-mining country, where, perhaps, it might turn out a good mine, as it is a principal vein. It throws the &s;eams of coal and &s;trata of &s;tone up to the &s;outhward, three fathoms; the core or gut of the dyke E D, which is about fifteen or &s;ixteen yards in width, is all hard, blue whin or granite, &s;uch as are u&s;ed for making the turnpike roads. On the ri&s;e &s;ide of the dyke, from A to B, the coal is turned to a black &s;ub&s;tance, commonly called dawk or &s;wad, like &s;oot caked together; from B to C the coal is turned into a pretty hard cinder; from thence &s;outhward the coal begins to put on its common appearance again. On the dip &s;ide of the dyke, from G to F, the coal is turned to dawk or &s;wad; and from F northward the coal begins to appear better by degrees, till it comes to its common cour&s;e again, but a good deal of it &s;hort and tender next the dawky part. Above that part which is cinder, in the roof or &s;tratum next the coal, there is a great deal of &s;ulphur, in angular forms, of a bright yellow colour, and very beautiful.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Chemical E&s;&s;ays by Richard Wat&s;on, D. D. F. R. S. vol. III.
<P>This may not be an improper place to add a word or two concerning the Derby&s;hire <HI>Toad&s;tone,</HI> which con&s;titutes one of the principal &s;trata in the mining country, and which is &s;uppo&s;ed to have been, in its origin, a <HI>&s;lag</HI> thrown out by a volcano. It perfectly re&s;embles &s;ome of the &s;pecimens I have &s;een of one of the &s;orts of lava of Ve&s;uvius, not only in the hardne&s;s of its texture, and blackne&s;s of its colour, but in its weight; a cubic foot of &s;ome forts of Derby&s;hire Toad&s;tone weighing more, and of the other le&s;s than a cubic foot of the Ve&s;uvian lava, which it re&s;embles. Neither the Derby&s;hire Toad&s;tone, nor that &s;ort of Ve&s;uvian lava which re&s;embles it, &s;eem to have experienced in their formation any great degree of heat, they are but in a half vitrified &s;tate; the Toad&s;tone I nave frequently melted in a &s;mith's forge into a black gla&s;s, and the Ve&s;uvian lava gives a gla&s;s of the &s;ame kind. The air has a mani&s;e&s;t action on the Derby&s;hire Toad&s;tone, for it not only wa&s;tes away the &s;par which is found in the blebs of &s;ome &s;orts of Toad&s;tone, but it reduces it into a browni&s;h mould, &s;it for vegetation, the mo&s;t hard and compact &s;orts; the Ve&s;uvian lava is &s;ubject to the &s;ame change from the &s;ame operation of the &s;ame cau&s;e.</P></NOTE> On each &s;ide of the blue &s;tone,
<PB N="506" REF="582">betwixt it and the regular &s;trata, there is a thin gut or core, about &s;ix inches thick, like clay, which turns water on the ri&s;e &s;ide of the dyke, and forces it to &endq;the &s;urface in &s;everal &s;prings in the direction of the dyke.</Q> The plan &s;hews that the &s;trata originally lay in a regular arrangement, but that being fractured by &s;ome &s;ubterranean convul&s;ion, the lava had in&s;inuated it&s;elf into the wound, and filled it: that the dyke is formed of lava cannot be doubted, from the &s;oot and cinder which attend it: on trying a &s;pecimen of the cinder, it is found to burn clear, without &s;moke, keeps a durable heat, and affords very little &s;ulphureous effluvia. The dyke appears at the &s;urface of the colour of iron &s;tone, thrown into irregular angles. It may be pre&s;umed the ri&s;ing &s;ide of the &s;trata was thrown up by the lava forcing it&s;elf into &s;ome horizontal channel which it had formed be|tween the &s;trata; that the &s;trata on the north &s;ide &s;unk when the lava bur&s;t forth; but how the &s;tratum of grey &s;tone was formed, mu&s;t be left to conjecture.</P>
<P>To what has been &s;aid of the lead mines, we mu&s;t add, that the Romans di&s;co|vered mines of lead in Britain, and after Claudian had carried his victorious arms northward, this country paid tribute in minerals and metals, particularly lead, of which &s;everal pieces, or <HI>pigs,</HI> have been found in different parts, with the names of &s;ome of the emperors and leaders upon them.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Stuk. Carau&s;. vol. I. p. 176.&mdash; Itin. Cutio&s;. p. 173.&mdash;Ph. Tran&s;. No. 459.&mdash;Camd. Brit. Edit. Opt. p. 679.</NOTE> Pliny tells us, that the mines were &s;o con&s;iderable, that by an imperial edict, only a certain quantity was to be worked, "the veins" (in the language of miners) "appearing at the very day," whil&s;t the mines of lead in the Spani&s;h province were few and unproductive.<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">In Britannia &s;ummo terrae curio adeo largi, ut lex ultra dicatur, ne plus certo modo fiat.&mdash;Plin. Nat. Hi&s;t. l. xxxiv. ch. 17.</NOTE> Tacitus informs us, that our <HI>Metalla</HI> were the lures of the Roman eagle, and remunerated them for the toils that attended their victories.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Cat. of Fo&s;&s;ils.&mdash; Woodward, p. 2, p. 84.</NOTE></P>
<P>The method or practice of working lead mines is twofold&mdash;one by &s;inking a pit or &s;haft, and the other by flooding or <HI>hu&s;hing,</HI> as it is termed; a large re&s;ervoir of water is formed on the eminences, which being let out and di&s;charged by a &s;luice, the full &s;tream is carried through a cut or opening on the &s;ide of the hill, and with an irre&s;i&s;tible impetuo&s;ity &s;weeps away the &s;oil and other &s;ub&s;tances which cover the vein, and carries with it the fragments of ore, and lays open to the miner the ore in the vein. To convey the water from mines, not only engines are u&s;ed, but <HI>levels, &s;ubterraneous pa&s;&s;ages,</HI> or <HI>drifts,</HI> are carried from the &s;ides of the hills, up to the veins, &s;ome of one hundred fathoms in length, and of dimen&s;ions large enough for &s;mall drays or carriages to pa&s;s in them, to bring away the metal. In &s;ome of the workings, &s;ubterraneous engines are employed.</P>
<P>Silver is extracted from &s;ome lead: it has been ob&s;erved, that one &s;ort of lead which was brought to the port of Newca&s;tle for &s;ale, yielded between thirty and forty ounces of &s;ilver per ton.<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Wallis, and &s;everal others, with &s;pecimens.</NOTE></P>

<P>The iron mines at Tanfield are the only workings of that kind in this county. Iron ore has been &s;melted in various parts anciently, as appears by the heaps of &s;lag left on many of the commons. The iron &s;tone has been gathered, it is pre|&s;umed, within a little di&s;tance of the &s;urface, or in the water runners and rivulets, and, when wood abounded, the ore was &s;melted in the neare&s;t places.</P>
<P>There are no copper works in the county.</P>
<P>Of birds, in&s;ects, and animals, we have no peculiars, but partake with the neighbouring counties; grou&s;e, partridge, and quails, are common; the rarer kinds of game are not found here; and phea&s;ants and cranes are &s;carce, even in the liberties of Raven&s;worth and on the banks of Derwent.

<P>In regard to the medicinal waters in this county, which are at Butterby, we can make little addition to what is &s;aid by Mr. Todd in the Philo&s;ophical Tran&s;|actions, and in&s;erted in the notes to the &s;econd volume of this work, page 326, &s;ave by the following extracts. Dr. Elliot, in his account of the medicinal vir|tues of our mineral waters,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">London, 1781.</NOTE> &s;peaking of the &s;ulphur water, &s;ays &s;hortly, <Q>It is a &startq;&s;trong &s;ulphureous water, and is al&s;o impregnated with &s;ea falt.

<P>The following curious extract from Dr. Wat&s;on's Chemical E&s;&s;ays, may be acceptable in this place, <Q>I have mentioned the <HI>&s;ulphur</HI> well at Harrowgate, &startq;according to its appellation at that place, without taking upon me to decide the long controverted que&s;tion, concerning the exi&s;tence of &s;ulphur in that and other waters of the &s;ame kind. Sulphur has been long e&s;teemed a mineral body, very common to be met with in waters; and all tho&s;e waters which have a &s;trong fetid &s;mell, re&s;embling that of a foul gun, have been e&s;teemed to be more or le&s;s impregnated with &s;ulphur. However, Dr. Ho&s;tman &s;eems to doubt much of its exi&s;tence, in the greater number of &s;uch waters; and Dr. Lucas has affirmed, that it is not to be found in the form of &s;ulphur in any water whatever; not even in that of Aix-la-Chapelle, where a true and perfect &s;ul|phur is found on the upper parts of the conduits, through which the water pa&s;&s;es; for he &s;ays, that &s;trictly &s;peaking, the&s;e waters do not contain &s;ulphur &s;ub&s;tantially di&s;covered in them, but are impregnated with a phlogi&s;ton, and an acid, the principles of &s;ulphur, which being in a volatile &s;tate are &s;ublimed, meet on the &s;urface of the conduits, and there unite in a true and perfect &s;ul|phur, which did not naturally exi&s;t in the water.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Monro on Mineral Waters, vol. I. p. 30, and 196.</NOTE> The author from whom I have made this extract, informs us, that Dr. Rutty maintains the exi&s;tence of &s;ulphur in mineral waters, and that both Dr. Shaw, and Dr. Short, found &s;ul|phur in Harrowgate water. Notwith&s;tanding the te&s;timony of &s;uch eminent phy&s;icians, the more recent opinion of a phy&s;ician, whom Dr. Monro con&s;ulted on the &s;ubject, in 1768, is again&s;t the exi&s;tence of &s;ulphur in &s;uch waters. "I have taken particular notice of every appearance of the Harrowgate waters, and mu&s;t own, I never ob&s;erved any appearance of &s;ulphur floating in them, nor any &s;cum at the top of the well; neither could I meet with any per&s;on in that quarter, who remembered the appearance of real &s;ulphur &s;ublimed, upon taking up the &s;tones at the bottom of the well, as mentioned by Dr. Neal." I beg leave to add my own ob&s;ervation on the &s;ubject, which I made in 1780.&mdash; The water in the well ri&s;es into a circular &s;tone ba&s;on; a whiti&s;h cru&s;t adheres to the &s;tone, where it is contiguous to the &s;urface of the water; I &s;craped off a portion of this cru&s;t, and putting it on a hot iron, I found that it burned with the flame and &s;mell of &s;ulphur.<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">The Butterby water is confined to a narrow ba&s;on; it has the &s;ame appearance; and in the &s;trand where it flows from the well, it leaves a white &s;limey &s;ediment, of a very &s;ulphureous &s;mell.&mdash;W. H.</NOTE> I do not think that this experiment ab&s;olutely warrants us to conclude, that actual &s;ulphur is contained in this and other wa|ters, generally denominated &s;ulphureous; we ju&s;tly infer from it, that &s;omething is &s;ublimed from the water, which either of it&s;elf is &s;ulphur, or which in con|junction &endq;with the air, or &s;ome other principle, con&s;titutes &s;ulphur.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;The pro&s;ecution of this &s;ubject would lead to &s;peculations too ab&s;tru&s;e for my de&s;ign; the following experiment, however, which I have frequently made,
<PB N="520" REF="596">will, I hope, throw no incon&s;iderable light on the cau&s;e of the impregnation of &endq;&s;ulphureous waters in general.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;The acid of vitriol does not act upon the common Derby&s;hire lead ore, ex|cept when it is a&s;&s;i&s;ted by heat, it then di&s;&s;olves it, and a great e&s;cape of air is ob&s;erved; I made this air, as it was di&s;charged from the ore, pa&s;s through a high bended tube into a bottle full of pump water; the water, in a very little time, acquired the fetid &s;mell of Harrowgate water; its ta&s;te was the &s;ame as that of &s;uch &s;ulphureous waters as contain no &s;alt; it was perfectly tran&s;parent, but in the cour&s;e of twenty-four hours it became cloudy, and lo&s;t mo&s;t of its &s;mell; it did not &s;uffer any precipitation, by the addition of the acid of vitriol; &s;ilver was blackened, both by being put into this water, and by being expo&s;ed to the vapour which aro&s;e from it; from all the&s;e circum&s;tances, it may pro|perly &endq;enough, I think, be called the artificial &s;ulphureous water.</Q></P>
<P>The Doctor then proceeds to mention &s;everal other minerals that produce the &s;ame kind of air, and concludes with ob&s;erving, that "the air extracted from iron by the acid of &s;ea &s;alt, impregnates with a &s;mell, &s;omewhat re&s;embling that of Harrowgate water."&mdash;We will clo&s;e this article with ob&s;erving, that when the Butterby &s;ulphureous water was di&s;covered, it was by boring for coals. A coal chiver is found in the &s;tratas adjoining; lead ore al&s;o has been found; &s;o that the vitriol and lead ore are proved to be in the vicinity: a dyke, or ca&s;t of the rocks, appears to cro&s;s the river a little above the &s;alt-&s;pring: this dyke is of the toad|&s;tone, and &s;hews, in its fi&s;&s;ures, that it contains iron; &s;o that &s;alt and iron are al&s;o proved to be near to the Butterby &s;ulphureous water.</P>
<P>Of the &s;alt &s;pring, which i&s;&s;ues from the fi&s;&s;ures of a rock, in the middle of the river Wear, Dr. Elliot only notes, that, "it is drunk as a purging water." Ber|kenhout, in his Synop&s;is, does not take notice of it. Mr. Todd &s;peaks of it, as mentioned in our &s;econd volume, p. 326. This neglect of &s;o great a curio&s;ity, and &s;o valuable a medicinal water is a&s;toni&s;hing. It renders double the quantity of &s;alt, which can be obtained from &s;ea water, and is a &s;trong chalybeate; on drop|ping a &s;mall quantity of tincture of galls into a wine gla&s;s full of water, it becomes almo&s;t as black as ink,. The e&s;tate is now fallen into the hands of mere ru&s;tics, and there is little probability that in their time, this valuable gift of nature will be further attended to, than to be the a&s;toni&s;hment of the vulgar, who repeat over it the miraculous tale of the monks wandering with the body of St. Cuthbert, and wanting &s;alt to their eggs, (an object of their prayers) found it incru&s;ted on tho&s;e rocks, by the &s;ame &s;un-&s;hine that roa&s;ted their me&s;s.</P>
<P>Of the chalybeate water at Hartlepool, mentioned in this volume, p. 33, we mu&s;t add, from Dr. Monro, vol. I. p. 381, that, <Q>It is an exceeding &s;ine clear &startq;water, which has a plea&s;ant chalybeate ta&s;te, and &s;mells a little of &s;ulphur. As it ri&s;es from the fountain, it is lighter than common water, but on &s;tanding,<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Dr. Short, vol. XI. p. 59.</NOTE> Dr. Short &s;ays, it loo&s;es both its &s;ulphur and chalybeate ta&s;te, though it depo&s;its no ochre. Evaporated, Dr. Short got from a gallon, one hundred grains of &s;ediment after the well was inclo&s;ed; of which, he &s;ays, fifty grains were light
<PB N="521" REF="597">calcareous earth. Fifty grains of &s;aline matter containing two parts of a &endq;calcareous glauber &s;alt, and one part of &s;ea &s;alt.</Q> Berkenhout, who quotes Short, vol. II. p. 59, and Monro, vol. I. p. 380, &s;ays, <Q>It contains iron, with a &startq;good deal of Ep&s;om &s;alt and calcareous earth; al&s;o &s;ome &s;ea &s;alt, and po&s;&s;ibly a little &s;ulphur." Dr Elliot &s;ays, "It is diuretic and laxative: and is recom|mended as excellent in &s;corbutic complaints, in bilious and nervous cholics, in pains of the &s;tomach, and indige&s;tion, in the gravel, in female <HI>complaints,</HI> in the &endq;hypochondriacal di&s;ea&s;e, in cachexy, in hectical heats, and in recent ulcers.</Q></P>
<P>Of the chalybeate &s;pring on Elvet moor, near Durham, Dr. Edward Wilon wrote a treati&s;e, under the title of <HI>Spadacrene Dunelmen&s;is,</HI> dated 1675, from which we extract the following curious note, ch. IV. <Q>That it hath a &s;pirit of &s;ulphur &startq;is apparent from the acid ta&s;te thereof, for nothing can make this ta&s;te in mi|nerals but &s;pirit of &s;ulphur, neither need we much doubt of &s;ulphur and its vaporous &s;pirit, where we have &s;o much coal; it having both an ironi&s;h ta&s;te and odour. Being di&s;tilled from a bottle thereof, there remained in the bottom a ru&s;ty iron-like powder, in quantity about ten grains, which, in ta&s;te, had a piercing, &s;harp, vitrioline pungency, &s;omewhat har&s;h. By evaporation, I had much le&s;s &s;ediment remaining, which makes me more than probably con|jecture, that it is impregnated, not &s;o much with the corporeal &s;ub&s;tance, as with the &s;piritual and &s;ubtile particles of the &s;aid vitriol; for the water being actuated with the &s;ulphureous acidity, and pa&s;&s;ing &s;wiftly through &s;ome hungry vein of iron, corrodes lightly its more tenuous and aerial parts, re&s;olving them &s;o, as the water imbibes in a manner only the volatile atoms, with which it be|comes thus &s;aturated; I &s;ay, volatile, becau&s;e, though di&s;tilled in a gla&s;s &s;till, and luted hermetically, yet are the &s;pirits &s;ooner &s;ublimed than the water, and take wing &s;o &s;wiftly, that before any water comes over, they are unbodied and evaporated, no odour or ta&s;te at all remaining in the water; neither will it then become any otherwi&s;e tinged with gall than common &s;pring water, though be|fore di&s;tillation, with the mixture of two or three grains of powder of galls, an ordinary gla&s;sful becomes as purpureou&s;ly red, as our genuine and be&s;t coloured &endq;claret.</Q></P>
<P>Before the divi&s;ion and inclo&s;ure of Elvet-moor, this &s;pring was hand&s;omely built over with hewn &s;tone, and &s;teps laid for an ea&s;y approach to it on each &s;ide; but has lately been &s;o far neglected, that it is now &s;carce to be di&s;covered: this is an age, in which, whatever was venerated by our ance&s;tors, is de&s;pi&s;ed: many modern vices &s;eem to be the i&s;&s;ue of that contempt of ance&s;try.</P>
<P>About two miles above Barnard Ca&s;tle, &s;ulphur water &s;prings from the crevi|ces of a rock in the bed of the river Tees, on the Durham &s;ide. It can only be come at when the river is low, and from its being often overflowed can &s;eldom be had pure. It is impregnated with the &s;ame ingredients as the Harrowgate water. The &s;mell is perceived at &s;ome hundred yards di&s;tance, and as the water runs over the rocks, it depo&s;its a large quantity of white &s;ediment, and is continually emitting bubbles of hepatic air. Taken as a purgative, and u&s;ed as a wa&s;h, it has been known to cure very ob&s;tinate cutaneous eruptions. It is not &s;o much re&s;orted to as formerly, owing to the uncertainty of procuring it free from rain
<PB N="522" REF="598">or river water. This &s;pring is &s;ituated in a mo&s;t beautiful and romantic valley, where the winding of the river, its banks finely clothed with woods, and a beautiful view towards Barnard Ca&s;tle, makes the pro&s;pect delightful. If the &s;pring was &s;ought for further from the bed of the river, it might probably be ob|tained more pure, and would be a valuable acqui&s;ition to the neighbourhood.</P>
<P>The premi&s;es belong to the Earl of Darlington, and it is hoped that his Lord|&s;hip will permit the trial to be made. The country is healthy, and not exceeded in natural beauties by any part of the kingdom. With proper conveniences, this would be a happy place of re&s;ort for the invalid. A chalybeate water on Bar|nard Ca&s;tle moor, is al&s;o of great efficacy.</P>
