<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P><HI>'TWou'd be hard to &s;u&s;pect him of Errors in Fact, who writes the Story of Ye&s;terday: A Hi&s;to|rian of three Weeks mu&s;t certainly be ju&s;t, for had he never &s;o much mind to Lye, 'twou'd be Non&s;en&s;e to expect the World cou'd be impos'd upon, every Bodies Memory would be a living Witne&s;s again&s;t him, and the Effect wou'd be only to expo&s;e him&s;elf.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Authors of Hi&s;tories generally Appollogize for their Quotations, plead that Indu&s;try in the &s;earch after Truth, and excu&s;e them&s;elves by a&s;&s;erting their Faithfulne&s;s of their Collections. The Author of the following Sheets is not afraid to let the World know, that he is &s;o &s;ure every thing related in this Account is Litterally and Po&s;itively true, that he challenges all the Wit and Malice the world abounds with, to confute the mo&s;t trifling Circum&s;tance.</HI></P>
<P><HI>If Aggravations are omitted, and &s;ome very ill natur'd pa&s;&s;ages let go without Ob&s;ervations, tho&s;e Per&s;ons who were guilty of them, may ob&s;erve that we have more good Nature than they have Manners; and they Ought to acknowledge it, &s;ince a great many Rudene&s;&s;es both again&s;t the King Him&s;elf and the</HI>
<PB REF="3">
<HI>Gentlemen concern'd have &s;cap'd their &s;currilous Mouth, which are not here animadverted upon.</HI></P>
<P><HI>And lea&s;t the World &s;hould think this Pre&s;umptive, and that the Accu&s;ation is only a &s;urmi&s;e, we will Query what they think of that kind Remark of Mr.</HI> J. H&mdash;w, <HI>finding the King's Letter to the Hou&s;e, and the</HI> Kenti&s;h <HI>Petition to come both on a Day, and the &s;ub&s;tance to be the &s;ame, That</HI> the King, the Dutch, and the Kenti&s;h Men, were all in a Plot again&s;t the Hou&s;e of Commons.</P>
<P><HI>I could have &s;well'd this Pamphlet to a large Vo|lume, if I &s;hou'd pretend to Collect all the</HI> Bellings|gate Language <HI>of a certain</HI> Hou&s;e full of Men, <HI>again&s;t the King, the Lords, and the Gentlemen of</HI> Kent; <HI>but 'tis a fitter &s;ubject for a Satyr than a Hi|&s;tory, they have abus'd the Nation, and Now are become a Banter to them&s;elves; and I leave them to con&s;ider of it, and reform.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I a&s;&s;ure the World, I am no</HI> Kenti&s;h <HI>Man, nor was my Hand to the Petition: Tho' had I been ac|quainted with it, I would have gone a Hundred Miles to ha' &s;ign'd it, and a Hundred more to have had the Opportunity of &s;erving my Country at the Ex|pence of an &V;nju&s;t Confinement for it.</HI></P>
<P><HI>It may be fairly concluded I am no</HI> Warwick|&s;hire <HI>Man neither, with a Petition in my Pocket, brought a Hundred Miles, and afraid to deliver it.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Nor my Name</HI> Sir Robert Clayton, <HI>by which you may know that I did not promi&s;e the Members, who</HI>
<PB REF="4">
<HI>were then in fear enough, to u&s;e my Intere&s;t to &s;tifle a City Petition.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Nor is my Name</HI> Legion, <HI>I wi&s;h it were, for I &s;hou'd ha' been glad to be capable of &s;peaking &s;o much Truth, and &s;o much to the purpo&s;e, as is contain'd in in that &V;nan&s;werable Paper.</HI></P>
<P><HI>But I am an unconcern'd Spectator, and have been an exact ob&s;erver of every pa&s;&s;age, have been an Eye and Ear Witne&s;s of every mo&s;t Minute Article, and am &s;ure that every thing related is as Exactly True, as the Cau&s;es of it all are Scandalous and Burthen|&s;ome to the Nation.</HI></P>
<P><HI>As to the Gentlemen of the Hou&s;e of Commons, I &s;hall not pretend to enter into their Character, be|cau&s;e I care not to enter into Captivity, nor come into the Clutches of</HI> that wor&s;t of Brutes their Sergeant.</P>
<P><HI>Litterally &s;peaking, no Member of the Hou&s;e of Commons can be a</HI> Jacobite, <HI>becau&s;e they have taken the Oaths to King</HI> William. <HI>But this may be ob&s;er|ved, that the</HI> Jacobites <HI>in</HI> England <HI>are generally the Only People who approve of their Proceedings, and appland their Mea&s;ures; and 'tis ob&s;ervable that at</HI> Paris, <HI>and St.</HI> Germans, <HI>the general Complement of a Health in all</HI> Engli&s;h <HI>Company is</HI> a la Sante Mon&s;ieur Jack-How; <HI>the truth of which there are not a few very good Gentlemen in Town can atte&s;t, from whence I think I may draw this Ob&s;ervation, that either he is a</HI> Jacobite, <HI>or the</HI> Jacobites <HI>are a very good Natur'd people.</HI></P>

<HEAD>THE HISTORY OF THE <HI>Kenti&s;h Petition.</HI></HEAD>
<P>ON the 29th of <HI>April,</HI> 1701. the Quarter-Se&s;&s;ions for the County of <HI>Kent,</HI> began at <HI>Maid&s;tone,</HI> where <HI>William Culpeper</HI> of <HI>Hollingbourn,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> was cho&s;en Chair-Man, tho' he was then ab&s;ent, and with an unu&s;ual Re&s;pect the Bench of Ju&s;tices pro|ceeded to do Bu&s;ine&s;s, and kept the Chair for him, for &s;everal Hours, till he came.</P>
<P>The People of the County of <HI>Kent,</HI> as well as in mo&s;t parts of the Kingdom, had expre&s;s'd great Di&s;&s;atisfaction at the &s;low proceedings of the Parliament; and that the <HI>King</HI> was not a&s;&s;i&s;ted, nor the <HI>Prote&s;tants</HI> abroad con&s;ider|ed; and the Country People began to &s;ay to one another in their Language, <HI>That they had &s;ow'd their Corn, and the</HI> French <HI>were a coming to Reap it:</HI> And from hence it is al|low'd to proceed, that during the &s;itting of the Se&s;&s;ion, &s;everal of the principal Freeholders of the County ap|plyed them&s;elves to the Chair-Main afore&s;aid, and told him, It was their De&s;ire that the Bench would con&s;ider of making &s;ome Application to the Parliament, to ac|quaint them of the Apprehen&s;ions of the People.</P>
<P>The Chair-Man reply'd, It was the proper work of the Grand-Jury, to pre&s;ent the Grievances of the Coun|try,
<PB N="2" REF="7">
and therefore he referr'd them to the &s;aid Grand-Jury who were then &s;itting.</P>
<P>The Grand Jury being applyed to, accepted the Pro|po&s;al, and addre&s;&s;ing to the &s;aid Mr. <HI>Culpeper,</HI> the Chair-man acquainting him that they had approv'd of &s;uch a a Motion made as before, and de&s;ir'd that the Bench would joyn with them; the Chair-man told them he would acquaint the Ju&s;tices of it, which he did, and they immediately approv'd of it al&s;o, and de&s;ired the &s;aid <HI>William Culpeper</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> their Chair-man, to draw a Petition.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Culpeper</HI> withdrew to Compo&s;e it, and having drawn a Petition, it was read, and approved, and imme|diately ordered to be carried to the Grand-Jury, being Twenty One in Number, who all Unanimou&s;ly &s;ign'd it, and brought it into Court, de&s;iring all the Gentlemen on the Bench would do the &s;ame; whereupon the Chair-man and three and twenty of the Ju&s;tices &s;ign'd it, and the Freeholders of the County crouded in &s;o fa&s;t, that the Parchment was filled up in le&s;s than five Hours time; and many Thou&s;ands of Hands might have been had to it, if the Ju&s;tices had not declin'd it, refu&s;ing to add any more Rolls of Parchment, as in&s;i&s;ting more upon the Merits of the Petition, than the Number of Sub&s;cribers.</P>
<P>By all which it appears how fooli&s;h and groundle&s;s their Pretences are, who would &s;ugge&s;t, that the Peti|tion was a private thing, tran&s;acted by a few People; whereas 'tis plain 'twas the Act and Deed of the whole Country.</P>
<P>The Words of the Petition are as follows.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="8">
To the Knights, Citizens, and Bur|ge&s;&s;es in Parliament a&s;&s;embled.</P>
<P><HI>The Humble Petition of the Gentlemen, Ju&s;tices of the Peace, Grand-Jury, and other Freeholders, at the General Quarter-Se&s;&s;ions of the Peace holden at</HI> Maid&s;tone, <HI>the 29th of</HI> April, <HI>in the thirteenth Year of the Reign of our Sovereign Lord King</HI> William III. <HI>over</HI> England, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P><Q>&startq;WE the <HI>Gentlemen, Ju&s;tices</HI> of the Peace, <HI>Grand-Jury,</HI> and other <HI>Freeholders,</HI> at the General Quarter-Se&s;&s;ions at <HI>Maid&s;tone</HI> in <HI>Kent,</HI> deeply Concern'd at the Dangerous E&s;tate of this <HI>Kingdom,</HI> and of all <HI>Europe;</HI> and con&s;idering that the Fate of <HI>&V;s</HI> and Our <HI>Po&s;terity</HI> depends upon the Wi&s;dom of Our <HI>Repre&s;en|tatives</HI> in <HI>Parliament,</HI> think Our Selves bound in Duty Humbly to lay before this Honourable Hou&s;e the Con|&s;equences in this Conjuncture of Your Speedy Re&s;olu|lution, and mo&s;t Sincere Endeavour to An&s;wer the Great&endq; Tru&s;t Repo&s;ed in You by Your Country.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;And in regard that from the Experience of all Ages it is manife&s;t, no Nation can be Great or Happy without Union, We hope that no <HI>Pretence</HI> what&s;oever &s;hall be able to Creat a <HI>Mi&s;under&s;tanding</HI> among Our Selves, or the lea&s;t <HI>Di&s;tru&s;t</HI> of His Maje&s;ty, Who&s;e Great <HI>Actions</HI> for this Nation are writ in the Hearts of His Subjects, and can never, without the blacke&s;t Ingratitude, be&endq; forgot.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;We mo&s;t Humbly Implore this Honourable Hou&s;e to have Regard to the <HI>Voice of the People,</HI> that Our <HI>Re|ligion</HI> and <HI>Safety</HI> may be Effectually Provided for, that Your <HI>Loyal Addre&s;&s;es</HI> may be turned into <HI>Bills of Supply,</HI>
<PB N="4" REF="9">
and that His Mo&s;t <HI>Sacred Maje&s;ty,</HI> (who&s;e <HI>Propitious</HI> and <HI>Vnblemi&s;h'd Reign</HI> Over Us We pray God long to to continue) may be Enabled Powerfully to A&s;&s;i&s;t His&endq; Allies before it be too late.</Q></P>
<P><HI>And Your Petitioners &s;hall every Pray,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>Signed by all the Deputy-Lieutenants there Pre&s;ent, above Twenty Ju|&s;tices of the Peace, all the Grand Jury, and other Freeholders, then there.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the Petition was Sign'd, and there was no more room for any Hands, it was deliver'd by the Grand-Jury to the afore&s;aid <HI>William Culpeper</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> Chair-man of the Se&s;&s;ion, and he was de&s;ir'd to pre&s;ent it in their Names to the Parliament, which at their reque&s;t he pro|mi&s;ed to do, and the re&s;t of the Gentlemen, viz. <HI>Tho|mas Culpeper</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> <HI>Ju&s;tinian Champney</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> <HI>David Pollhill</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> and <HI>William Hamilton</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> offered them&s;elves to go with him.</P>
<P>On <HI>Tue&s;day</HI> the 6th of <HI>May,</HI> they came to Town with the Petition, and the next day they went up to the Hou&s;e, and applyed them&s;elves to Sir <HI>Thomas Hales,</HI> in order to de&s;ire him to pre&s;ent it to the Hou&s;e; he being one of the Repre&s;entatives of the County of <HI>Kent;</HI> Sir <HI>Thomas</HI> read the Petition, and telling them it was too late to pre&s;ent it that day, it being after 12 a Clock; de&s;ir'd they wou'd let him &s;how it Mr. <HI>Pellham</HI> of <HI>Su&s;&s;ex,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Culpeper</HI> told him he was willing enough Mr. <HI>Pellham</HI> &s;hou'd &s;ee the Petition, not doubting he wou'd be a Friend to it, but that he was unwilling to part with it, being entru&s;ted with it by his Country, adding, <HI>That he &s;hould make but an Indifferent Figure in the County, if the Peti|tion &s;hould be got out of his Hands and lo&s;t.</HI> Whereupon
<PB N="5" REF="10">
Sir <HI>Thomas Hales,</HI> pa&s;t his Word, and Honour, that he would not &s;how it to any Per&s;on whatever, but to Mr. <HI>Pellham,</HI> and that he would return it to them immedi|ately. But this Word and Honour &s;o &s;olemnly engag'd, was as ea&s;ily forgotten: For having got the Petition, he carried it into the Hou&s;e, where he &s;tay'd an hour and half, and then returning, he gave it to the Gentle|men; and told them he had &s;hown it to Sir <HI>Edward Seymour</HI> and &s;everal others.</P>
<P>This Perfidious Account to that very part of the Na|tion which he repre&s;ented, de&s;erves &s;ome &s;pecial Notice, and there is no que&s;tion but the People will remember it for him, and &s;how their Re&s;entment on proper occa&s;ions.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Culpeper</HI> in the Name of the re&s;t, gave him an An&s;wer &s;uitable to the account, and &s;ufficient to let him know their Surprize at &s;o Ungentleman-like U&s;age, viz. <HI>That he had broke his Word, and &s;erved his Country very ill.</HI> But this being neither place, nor &s;ea&s;on for further Debates, he appointed to meet them in the Evening, and then after making them wait two Hours, beyond his time, he adjourn'd them till next Morning in the <HI>Court of Reque&s;t,</HI> where he told them ab&s;olutely, <HI>That he wou'd not deliver the Petition.</HI></P>
<P>Here it is very ob&s;ervable, that at the very time Sir <HI>Thomas Hales</HI> came out of the Hou&s;e, and return'd the Petition in the manner abovemention'd, Mr. <HI>Meredith</HI> the other Repre&s;entative for the County, came to them, and told them that their Petition had been expos'd in the Hou&s;e, and that Mr. <HI>How</HI> was then making a Speech again&s;t it.</P>
<P>The Gentlemen finding them&s;elves thus betrayed by Sir <HI>Thomas Hales,</HI> con&s;ulted together, about finding an|other more proper Per&s;on to deliver the Petition, and re&s;olv'd to apply them&s;elves to Mr. <HI>Meredith,</HI> the other
<PB N="6" REF="11">
Member for the County of <HI>Kent,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Meredith</HI> ha|ving agreed to Deliver it, in ca&s;e Sir <HI>Thomas Hales</HI> &s;hould refu&s;e, had appointed to meet them, with &s;everal other Gentlemen Members of the Hou&s;e, in order to con&s;ult about the matter of the Petition, and the manner of delivering it.</P>
<P>In the Morning the Hou&s;e being met, Mr. <HI>Meredith</HI> came out and told them, The Hou&s;e was in &s;uch a Fer|ment, that none of the Gentlemen dur&s;t appear for it, nor come to them, and he doubted would not venture &s;o much as to &s;peak a Word in the Hou&s;e for the Petition.</P>
<P>Not were the&s;e all the Di&s;couragements the Gentlemen met with in their Pre&s;enting the Petition, but &s;everal Members of the Hou&s;e pretending re&s;pect, and others that were really their Friends, and in concern for them, came out of the Hou&s;e to them, and endeavour'd to per|&s;wade them not to expo&s;e them&s;elves to the fury of the Hou&s;e, by delivering the Petition, telling them that Mr. <HI>How</HI> in particular, had &s;aid, <HI>That if there were One Hundred Thou&s;and Hands to the Petition, they &s;hould be all made Ex|amples of.</HI> And Sir <HI>Edward Seymour</HI> added, <HI>That the whole County &s;hould be Double Tax'd, and the E&s;tates of tho&s;e who pre&s;ented it, be Confi&s;cated to the u&s;e of the War.</HI></P>
<P>Altho' the&s;e Menaces, together with the almo&s;t Om|nipotent Power of the Hou&s;e of Commons, had Circum|&s;tances enough in them to &s;hake the Re&s;olution of a whole County, yet they had not the Effects here which was expected, for the Gentlemen far from being terrified at all this, unanimou&s;ly declar'd their Re&s;olution to di&s;|charge the Tru&s;t plac'd in them by their Country, <HI>and to pre&s;ent it to the Hou&s;e;</HI> and Mr. <HI>William Colepeper</HI> in parti|cular <HI>alluding to the Words of</HI> Luther, <HI>to tho&s;e who di&s;waded him from going to the City of</HI> Worms, told them, <HI>That if</HI>

<P>The Petition being thus delivered, the Gentlemen at|tended, for Mr. <HI>Speaker</HI> further to Intimidiate them, had let fall &s;ome Speeches, that <HI>It was the u&s;age of the Hou&s;e when a Petition was brought in, the Per&s;ons who pre&s;ented it, ought to be ready without to ju&s;tifie the matter of their Petition.</HI> And the Gentlemen &s;eeing no rea&s;on to be a&s;ham'd of theirs, in particular, re&s;olv'd to abide the utmo&s;t which their and the Nation's Enemies could do to them.</P>
<P>Having waited about half an Hour, they were call'd in to the Bar of the Hou&s;e, where Mr. Speaker <HI>Treating them in his u&s;ual haughty Tone.</HI> This &s;hort Dialogue pa&s;t between them.</P>

and would continue &s;o for &s;ome time, to give them op|portunity to recollect them&s;elves, and by a timely ac|knowledgment to &s;ave them&s;elves from Ruine.</P>
<P>The Gentlemen being at a lo&s;s to know in what par|ticular they could have given the Hou&s;e &s;uch Offence, and being well a&s;&s;ur'd they were in the protection of the Law, and had not acted any thing but what the known Con&s;titution of the Realm expre&s;ly allow'd, re|main'd &s;till un&s;haken, and boldly replyed, <HI>They had no nothing to &s;ay but what was in their Petition.</HI></P>
<P>But being further pre&s;s'd by Sir <HI>Theophilus Oglethorp,</HI> and &s;everal other Gentlemen; and becau&s;e they wou'd not &s;how any Di&s;re&s;pect to the Hou&s;e, or &s;eem to &s;light their Di&s;plea&s;ure, they con&s;ider'd of an An&s;wer to be given to the propo&s;al of Submi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>And becau&s;e whatever An&s;wer they gave, might be mi&s;repre&s;ented to the Hou&s;e, delivered by Word of Mouth, they re&s;olved to put it into Writing, and ha|ving con&s;ulted a while, they agreed to &s;end in this Civil An&s;wer.</P>
<Q><P><Q><HI>&startq;We are Humbly of Opinion, that it is our Right to Petition this Ho|nourable Hou&s;e according to the Sta|tute of</HI> 13 Car. 2. <HI>As to the matter of Our Petition, We declare that we Intend Nothing Offen&s;ive to this Ho|nourable&endq; Hou&s;e.</HI></Q></P></Q>
<P><PB N="10" REF="15">
This Writing being &s;hown to Sir <HI>Theophilus Oglethorp,</HI> and &s;everal other Members, they began to &s;mile; and imagin'd their Point gain'd, and told the Gentlemen they were glad they began to be &s;en&s;ible of their Danger; and if they would but add one Word more, <HI>viz.</HI> that they were &s;orry for what they had done, they would undertake for the Clemency of the Hou&s;e: This they unanimou&s;ly refus'd, one of the Gentlemen with &s;ome heat, replying, <HI>We will have no Sorry.</HI> Here the Members (or Con&s;pira|tors rather) would have had them put it, That they did it through Inadvertency. This they al&s;o refus'd, decla|ring they did it at the Reque&s;t of their Country, mature|ly, and deliberately, were ju&s;tified in doing it by the Laws of the Land, and they would never recede from it. So they delivered the Paper to Sir <HI>Thomas Hales,</HI> but whe|ther he delivered it to the Hou&s;e or no, he never had the Civility to inform them.</P>
<P>The Debate in the Hou&s;e held five Hours, after whcih Notice was given them by the Me&s;&s;engers, that the Hou&s;e had voted the Petition Scandalous, In&s;olent, and Sediti|ous, <HI>vid.</HI> the Votes, <HI>tending to de&s;troy, &amp;c.</HI> and ordered them to be taken into Cu&s;tody for the &s;ame; upon which the Gentlemen went, and immediately &s;urrendred them&s;elves to the Sergeant, tho' the Warrant was not made out for &s;ome Hours after.</P>
<P>The Sergeant only asked them where he &s;hould come to them at Dinner, which was agreed to be at the <HI>Ca&s;tle-Tavern</HI> in <HI>Fleet-&s;treet,</HI> where they Din'd, on <HI>Thur&s;|day, Friday,</HI> and <HI>Saturday,</HI> and were hitherto very civilly treated by his Officers; and accompanied by great Num|bers of Citizens and Gentlemen of the fir&s;t Quality, and not a few of the Nobility; the Officers were &s;eldom with them, went of Errands for them, and oftentimes were all ab&s;ent together; &s;o that there was no colour of Rea&s;on for the Sergeant to &s;ay, he fear'd a Re&s;cue, for

<P>On <HI>Friday</HI> in the Evening, Mr. Sergeant began to treat with them and repre&s;enting his ab&s;olute Power, letting them know, <HI>That he had an &V;nbounded liberty of u&s;ing them at Di&s;cretion, that he could confine them at plea&s;ure, put them into Dungeons, lay them under Ground, keep them apart, re|move them daily, and keep all People from them, by making them clo&s;e Pri&s;oners.</HI> He thereby gave them to under&s;tand, that he expected a Con&s;ideration &s;uitable to his Civi|lity; upon this the Gentlemen offered him One Hun|dred Guineas, half in Hand, and the other when they &s;hou'd be Di&s;charg'd, tho' it &s;hould be next day: The Sergeant neither accepted nor refus'd the offer, nor ex|pre&s;s'd any di&s;like, as if he thought it too little, but appointed to come to them the next day.</P>
<P><HI>Saturday</HI> in the <HI>Evening</HI> Mr. <HI>Thomas Colepeper,</HI> having notice that his Lady was very much frighted at his Con|finement, de&s;ir'd leave of the Me&s;&s;enger, in who&s;e Cu|&s;tody he was, to let him go down to <HI>Maid&s;tone,</HI> upon his parole to return by <HI>Monday</HI> Night; which the Me&s;&s;enger tacitly granted.</P>
<P>The re&s;t of the Gentlemen being met at the Tavern, expecting the Sergeant according to appointment, and ha|ving waited till Ten a Clock, in&s;tead of coming him&s;elf, he &s;ends Orders to the Me&s;&s;engers to &s;eperate the Gentle|men, and confine them in &s;everal Pri&s;ons, that very Night: which Order the Officers executed as rudely as the Sergeant could de&s;ire, &s;aving that they obtained the Civility from the Officers to be confined two in one place, and two in another, but were hurried away with &s;uch Unmannerly Indecency, that they would not per|mit them to &s;end for their Night-Gowns, and Nece&s;&s;aries.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="17">
In this manner Mr. <HI>William Colepeper,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Ju&s;tinian Champneys</HI> were carried to <HI>Myat</HI>'s Hou&s;e the Me&s;&s;enger in <HI>Fox-Court</HI> in <HI>Holborn,</HI> where they had this hard Choice propo&s;ed to them at their Entrance, whether they would Lodge in the Cellar, or in the Garret; and choo&s;ing the latter, they were thru&s;t into a little Hole, on top of the Hou&s;e, where they had all the Inconveniencies of a na&s;ty Pri&s;on, as <HI>ba&s;e Lodging, foul Sheets, little Covering,</HI> and a <HI>Cold Room;</HI> by which means they both took &s;uch Cold, as they have not yet recovered.</P>
<P>But Mr. Sergeant, <HI>le&s;t they &s;hould not be treated ill enough,</HI> coming the next Morning to Mr. <HI>Myat</HI>'s Hou&s;e, was in a great rage at him, and drawing his Sword, cut him over the Head, for <HI>u&s;ing the Gentlemen &s;o civilly,</HI> as he call'd it: Afterwards coming up into the Garret where Mr. <HI>Colepeper</HI> and Mr. <HI>Ju&s;tinian Champneys</HI> were lodg'd, they ask'd him, What Order he had for u&s;ing them thus? He replyed, He had an Order from tho&s;e who commit|ted them. Being ask'd again, If there was any &s;uch Vote pa&s;t in the Hou&s;e? He &s;aid No, but he had an Order. Mr. <HI>Colepeper</HI> replyed, <HI>If it be not a Vote of the Hou&s;e, pray how is it an Order? Have the Majority of the Hou&s;e, one by one, come to you and given you Direction to u&s;e us thus barba|rou&s;ly?</HI> He replyed, Yes, they had. For which &s;candalous Reflection, if Fal&s;e, his Ma&s;ters the Members of the Hou&s;e of Commons, are exceedingly oblig'd to him. Mr. <HI>Cole|peper</HI> told him, <HI>He believ'd he &s;hou'd live to &s;ee him Hang'd:</HI> And &s;o they parted.</P>
<P>All this while Mr. <HI>Polhill</HI> and Mr. <HI>Hamilton</HI> were put into a Cellar, without the favour of having their choice, and had &s;o vile a Lodging, that they could &s;carce breath; and was likewi&s;e in their turn <HI>Bullyed</HI> by Mr. Sergeant the next day; and when they ask'd him to &s;how them the Copy of their Commitment, he denyed it; Mr. <HI>Polhill</HI> in particular replyed, They askt him nothing but

what by Law he ought to grant: He rudely replyed, <HI>He cared not a Fart for them nor the Law neither.</HI> And &s;o left them; which Refu&s;al of his he may hear of again perhaps in a way of Legal Application.</P>
<P>On <HI>Tue&s;day</HI> he gave the Hou&s;e notice, that the younger Mr. <HI>Colepeper</HI> had made his e&s;cape, <HI>tho' he had a Letter from him that he wou'd be in Town that very Day;</HI> and at the &s;ame time he made a Complaint that the other Gentlemen be|haved them&s;elves &s;o di&s;orderly, that he apprehended a Re&s;cue; tho' the Gentlemen, to avoid any &s;u&s;pition, had voluntarily &s;urrendred their Swords to the Me&s;&s;engers, without being required &s;o to do.</P>
<P>This complaint to the Hou&s;e was the Gentlemen's De|liverance, and the Sergeant's di&s;appointment, tho' not in kindne&s;s to them neither, for ordering them to the <HI>Gatehou&s;e,</HI> as a more Ignominious Confinement, the Serge|ant lo&s;t the Extravagant Fees which he de&s;ign'd to Extort from them; and the Humanity of Captain <HI>Taylor,</HI> the Keeper of the <HI>Gatehou&s;e,</HI> made their re&s;traint ea&s;ie to them: For this Keeper us'd them like Gentlemen, and the Reputation he has obtain'd by his Civility, will be as La&s;ting as the Infamy of the <HI>Sergeant,</HI> the one leaves a a grateful Acknowledgement in the Mouths of all Men, and will always be &s;poken of to his Advantage; and the other <HI>Nautious like the Per&s;on,</HI> is di&s;honourable both to his Memory, and to the Hou&s;e that imploy'd him.</P>
<P>On <HI>Wedne&s;day, Thomas Colepeper</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> the younger Bro|ther, who had been in <HI>Kent,</HI> and who was ju&s;t come up, according to his promi&s;e, rendred him&s;elf to the <HI>Speaker,</HI> and de&s;ired to be &s;ent to his Brethren; Mr. <HI>Sergeant</HI> who thought to make him&s;elf amends upon him, la|boured to have him continued in his Cu&s;tody, and had not that Party in the Hou&s;e thought the <HI>Gatehou&s;e</HI> a greater puni&s;hment, po&s;&s;ibly it had been &s;o. <HI>But therein that Infallible Hou&s;e were deceiv'd,</HI> and he was deliver'd from the Hands of a Villain, by his Enemies them&s;elves,
<PB N="14" REF="19">
who thought they had mortified him the more, to the infinite regret of the Sergeant, and the general &s;atisfacti|on of his fellow Sufferers.</P>
<P>The &s;ame Morning that Mr. <HI>Colepeper</HI> &s;urrendred him|&s;elf, <HI>The Legion Paper,</HI> as 'twas called, was &s;ent to the Hou&s;e, 'twas &s;aid it was delivered the Speaker by a Woman, but I have been inform'd &s;ince, that it was a mi&s;take, and that 'twas delivered by the very Per&s;on who wrote it, guarded with about Sixteen Gentlemen of Quality, who if any notice had been taken of him, were ready to have carried him off by Force; 'twas re|ported, that Mr. <HI>Thomas Colepeper</HI> brought it out of <HI>Kent,</HI> and that all the County were at his Heels to make it good, tho' it was really no &s;uch thing, and that Gentle|man declar'd he knew nothing at all of it.</P>
<P>But be it as it will, that Paper &s;truck &s;uch a Terror into the Party in the Hou&s;e, that from that time there was not a Word ever &s;poken in the Hou&s;e, of proceeding again&s;t the <HI>Kenti&s;h</HI> Petitioners, and the Members of that party began to drop off, and get into the Country, for their Management began to be &s;o di&s;liked over the whole Nation, that their own Fears dictated to them they had run things too far.</P>
<P>The Cla&s;hings with the upper Hou&s;e about the Tryal of the Four Peers they had Impeach'd, and the mi&s;erable &s;hifts they were driven to by the Lords, to avoid Trying them, &s;erv'd but to make them more unea&s;ie, and to ha&s;ten the di&s;patch of the Money-Bills, in order to the Prorogation, which was on the 23d. of <HI>June,</HI> 1701.</P>
<P>By the Prorogation, the <HI>Kenti&s;h</HI> Gentlemen were di&s;|charg'd, but to &s;how their re&s;pect to the Civility of Cap|tain <HI>Taylor</HI> their Keeper, they continued to Lodge with him till they went into the Country.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="20">
The Fir&s;t Honour done them on account of their Sufferings, was their being invited to a Noble Enter|tainment at <HI>Mercers-Hall</HI> in <HI>Cheap&s;ide,</HI> at the Charge of the Citizens of <HI>London,</HI> where above Two Hundred Gentlemen din'd with them, together with &s;everal Noble Lords and Members of Parliament.</P>
<P><HI>Thur&s;day</HI> the 2d of <HI>July,</HI> they &s;et out for <HI>Kent,</HI> the Ci|tizens had offered to accompany them out of Town, but they declin'd it, de&s;iring to go privately.</P>
<P>And tho&s;e who pretend to charge them with affecting Popularity, would do well to remember, that they were fain to &s;end their Coaches empty out of Town, and go by Water to meet them, to avoid the Re&s;pect which the Citizens would have &s;hown them.</P>
<P>But there was no &s;hunning the Appearance of the Country, who &s;how'd their value for the Gentlemen, and the Cau&s;e for which they had &s;uffered in all the po&s;&s;ible terms of Re&s;pect and Affection.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t In&s;tance of this was at <HI>Black-Health,</HI> where Mr. <HI>David Pollhill,</HI> one of the Gentlemen, was to &s;eperate from the re&s;t, his Road lying near <HI>Browley</HI> to his Hou&s;e at <HI>Ottford</HI> in <HI>Kent.</HI> He was met at <HI>Black-Health</HI> by above 500 Hor&s;e, who receiv'd him into the mid&s;t of them, and &s;urrounded his Coach with &s;uch Shouts, and Joy, as &s;ufficiently te&s;tified their Re&s;pect for him, and their Sa|tisfaction at his Return among them: Nor can I omit that having to &s;atisfie my Curio&s;ity, drank among and di&s;cours'd with &s;ome of that Party, while they were waiting for Mr. <HI>Polhill:</HI> I never heard of any Gentleman more univer&s;ally beloved by the Country, or more particularly di&s;tingui&s;h'd for Mode&s;ty and Temper; and I believe I may affirm that 'twou'd be hard to find any Gentleman &s;o near the City of <HI>London,</HI> who could have
<PB N="16" REF="21">
had &s;uch an appearance, of his own Tenants and Neigh|bours, to Congratulate his Deliverance.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Polhill</HI> being come to the Corner of the Park-Wall on <HI>Black-Heath,</HI> &s;topt to take his leave of his Brethren, and giving them a Loud Huzza, wi&s;ht them a good Journey, and proceeded to <HI>Ottford.</HI></P>
<P>All po&s;&s;ible Demon&s;trations of Joy concluded the Day, and it has not been known that the Country ever expre&s;t more Satisfaction &s;ince the Coronation of King <HI>William,</HI> than at the return of this Gentleman.</P>
<P>The re&s;t of the Gentlemen proceeded to <HI>Roche&s;ter,</HI> where they were met by &s;uch a Body of Hor&s;e, that the principal Inns of the Town could not entertain them, &s;ome of whom had come 20 Miles to meet them.</P>
<P>The Mayor of <HI>Roche&s;ter</HI> Paid his Re&s;pect to them, and complain'd that he had no notice given him of their com|ing, otherwi&s;e he would have met them out of Town with a good Body of Hor&s;e.</P>
<P>Here they re&s;ted to refre&s;h them&s;elves and Hor&s;es, and about 6 a Clock &s;et forward for <HI>Maid&s;tone;</HI> the People of <HI>Maid&s;tone,</HI> tho' it was Market-day, could not have patience to wait at the place where they generally go to meet the Judges, but a great many Hor&s;e-men met them on the Downs, and the top of <HI>Boxley-hill</HI> 4 Miles from the Town.</P>
<P>At <HI>Sandlin</HI> about 2 Miles from the Town, the Gentle|men of the Neighbourhood met them with their Coaches, and an Innumerable Multitude of People on Hor&s;e-back, and on Foot, &s;houting and bidding them welcome.</P>
<P>After a &s;hort &s;tay here, to receive the Complements of the Gentlemen, they proceeded (the Gentlemens Coaches falling into the Rear) to the Park, the Seat of the <HI>Lady Taylor,</HI> who is Married to Mr. <HI>Thomas Colepeper,</HI> where they were welcom'd by the <HI>&s;aid Lady Taylor,</HI> the <HI>Old Lady Colepeper</HI> the Mother of the Gentlemen, and &s;everal Ladies of Quality, the People &s;houting all the while, <HI>A Colepeper, a Colepeper,</HI> and the Poor &s;trowing the Ways with Greens and Flowers; and thus they proceeded into
<PB N="17" REF="22">
the Town, with &s;uch Univer&s;al Acclamations of the People, as the like was never &s;een in that Country &s;ince the Re&s;toration of King <HI>Charles</HI> the Second.</P>
<P>The Night concluded with a great Bonfire, and the Healths of all the Gentlemen drank round it, to the great Mortification of the <HI>Jacobites,</HI> of whom there are but very few in tho&s;e parts; and to the general Satisfaction of the Country.</P>
<P>Nor was this the only appearance, for at <HI>Beart&s;ted,</HI> about three Miles further, the Country was a&s;&s;embled, the Bells rung, and &s;everal Hundreds of the People continued together all Night, with Extraordi|nary Joy, expecting that the Elder Mr. <HI>Colepeper,</HI> Mr. <HI>Champneys,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Hamilton,</HI> would have continued their Journey to <HI>Holingbourn,</HI> the antient Seat of the Family of the <HI>Colepepers;</HI> But the Extraordinary Recep|tion they found at <HI>Maid&s;tone,</HI> had detain'd them &s;o long, that 'twas too late to go on; &s;o they lay at <HI>Maid|&s;tone</HI> that Night, and the next day abundance of Gentle|men and Country People, came particularly to pay their Re&s;pects to them, and bid them welcome into the Country.</P>
<P>And at the time of the A&s;&s;izs lately held at <HI>Maid&s;tone,</HI> the Grand-Jury con&s;i&s;ting of very eminent Gentlemen and Freeholders of the County, whereof 12 were Ju&s;tices of the Peace, went in a Body to the Gentlemen, and publick|ly gave them Thanks for their Fidelity to the Country, in Delivering their Petition to the Parliament.</P>
<P>In all the&s;e Expre&s;&s;ions of the Country's Joy at the re|turn of the&s;e hone&s;t Gentlemen, it might be enquired, what they &s;aid of the Parliament? becau&s;e 'tis &s;o natural to Cur&s;e with one Hand, when we Ble&s;s with the other, that it might be rationally expected; 'tis true, the Coun|try being ju&s;tly di&s;oblig'd at the ill u&s;age of the&s;e Gentle|men, did not &s;pare their Reflections, but I choo&s;e to pa&s;s it over, becau&s;e 'tis not Parliaments in general, but <HI>the Con&s;pirators</HI> and <HI>Jacobite Party</HI> in a Parliament, that are at pre&s;ent the Nations burthen, and from whom &s;he groans to be redeem'd.</P>

<HEAD>THE CONCLUSION.</HEAD>
<P>HAD this Nation li&s;tend to the Calls of their own Rea&s;on, and to the Voice of things, all this Confu&s;ion of Councils had been prevented; had the People of <HI>England</HI> cho&s;en Men of Hone&s;ty, and of Peaceable Principles, Men of Candor, di&s;|engaged from Intere&s;t and De&s;ign, that had nothing before them but the Benefit of their Country, the Safety of Religion, and the Intere&s;t of <HI>Europe,</HI> all this had been avoided; they would never have Impri&s;on'd Five Hone&s;t Gentlemen for coming to them with the Sence of their Country in a peaceable Petition: they would never have had the occa&s;ion to repent of their refu&s;ing to hearken to the Voice of the People: But it is too late to look back, the Nation has had the misfortune to choo&s;e them, and our Peace, and Liberty, and the <HI>Prote&s;tant</HI> Intere&s;t in <HI>Europe</HI> is too much in their Hands.</P>
<P>All the Advice I can pretend to give my fellow Slaves, and Country-men, is that they would not be backward to let the Gentlemen know, that the Nation is &s;en&s;ible they are not doing their Duty; and withal, that to Impo&s;e upon the Rights and Liber|ties of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nation, has always been fatal to the Per&s;ons of tho&s;e who have attempted it, and their Examples &s;tand as Bouys and Marks to warn Po&s;terity of the hidden Dangers which others have fallen into.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="24">
It has been fatal to <HI>Favorites,</HI> to <HI>Judges,</HI> to <HI>Lords,</HI> and to <HI>Kings,</HI> and will certainly be &s;o even to <HI>parliaments,</HI> if they De&s;cend to Abu&s;e the <HI>people</HI> they repre&s;ent.</P>
<P>The Impri&s;oning the&s;e Five Gentlemen, had neither Rea&s;on, Law, Pretence, nor Policy in it.</P>
<P>It had no Rea&s;on in it, becau&s;e they had offen|ded again&s;t no Law, either of Rea&s;on, or the Na|ture of the thing.</P>
<P>It had no Law in it, becau&s;e they had no Legal Power to commit any but their own Members.</P>
<P>And I am of the opinion, they are Convinc'd there was no Policy in it, for there is &s;eldom much Policy in doing that publickly, which we know we &s;hall be a&s;ham'd of.</P>
<P>The not proceeding again&s;t them afterward, &s;hewed they were either a&s;ham'd or afraid; had they been in the Right, there could be no Rea&s;on to fear; and if in the Wrong, they had all the Rea&s;on in the world to be a&s;ham'd.</P>
<P>To commit Five Gentlemen to Cu&s;tody, for Petitioning them to do what they really knew they ought to have done, 'twas the mo&s;t prepo&s;terous thing in Nature: <HI>To puni&s;h for Humbly Petitioning!</HI> 'tis Non&s;en&s;e in it &s;elf. God him&s;elf permits the Meane&s;t and mo&s;t De&s;picable of his Creatures to remind him, <HI>as we may &s;ay,</HI> of their Wants, and

But to re&s;ent the Repre&s;entation of their Country, and Impri&s;on Gentlemen who at the Re|que&s;t of the Freeholders of a County came under the expre&s;s protection of an Act of Parliament to deliver a Petition! 'twas the mo&s;t Ridiculous In|con&s;i&s;tent Action that ever Parliament of <HI>England</HI> was guilty of; and with &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, I think the be&s;t Action the &s;ame Hou&s;e can do at their next Meeting, is to Vote that it &s;hould be Raz'd out of their Journals, and never be made a Pre&s;ident for the time to come; upon which condition, and no other, the Nation ought to forgive it them.</P>
<P>The Act of the 13 <HI>Carol.</HI> 2. to a&s;&s;ert the Right of the Subjects Petitioning, is a &s;ufficient Authority for any one to quote, and tho&s;e that pretend to call this an Illegal Act, mu&s;t fir&s;t trample down the Authority of that Act of Parliament.</P>
<P>Let this Act ju&s;tifie me, in &s;aying, that to Im|pri&s;on <HI>Engli&s;h-men</HI> for Petitioning, is Illegal, and a Di&s;honour to <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Parliaments, <HI>Leigion Article</HI> the</P>
<P>But &s;ay the Lame Excu&s;ers of this Excentrick Mo|tion of the Hou&s;e, this was a Factious thing contriv'd by a few private In&s;ignificant People of no value, and the Matter of it is Saucy and Impertinent.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, had it been a Petition of the meane&s;t and mo&s;t incon&s;iderable Per&s;on in <HI>England,</HI> and that &s;ingle by him&s;elf, provided he were a Freeholder of

<HI>England,</HI> he had a Legal Right to &s;peak his mind, for that &s;ame Rea&s;on from whence the Commons in Parliament claim a Freedom of Speech, gives every Commoner a freedom to Speak to the Hou&s;e, &s;ince every Freeholder has an equal concern in their Debates, and equal power in deputeing them to &s;it there. But becau&s;e this Right unlimited, might be tumultuous and unea&s;ie, therefore the Method how he &s;hall do it, is circum&s;crib'd for Decency-&s;ake, that it &s;hall be done by Petition, and that Petition &s;hall be pre&s;ented <HI>&s;o</HI> and <HI>&s;o,</HI> and by &s;uch a Number, and no more: but that it &s;hould not be lawful to Petition, no Tribunal, no Court, no Collective or Repre&s;entative Body of Men in the World ever refu&s;ed it; nay, the <HI>Inqui&s;ition</HI> of <HI>Spain</HI> does not forbid it, the <HI>Divan</HI> of the <HI>Turks</HI> allows it, and I believe if <HI>Sathan</HI> him&s;elf kept his Court in publick, he would not prohibit it.</P>
<P>But be&s;ides this, the Fact is not true: As for it being contriv'd by a few People, let the Impartial Relation here given, An&s;wer that Ridiculous Un|truth, unle&s;s you will account the County of <HI>Kent</HI> a Few for certainly 11 parts of 12 in the whole County, and now of the whole Kingdom approve of it.</P>
<P>Nor has the Reproach upon the Per&s;ons, pre|&s;enting it, more of truth, unle&s;s Gentlemen of Antient and Illu&s;trious Families, who&s;e Ance&s;tors have been known for &s;everal Ages to be Men of Honour and E&s;tates, allyed to &s;everal of the Nobility, and now known and valued by the whole County, both

for their con&s;iderable Fortunes, as well as Per&s;onal Merit, unle&s;s I &s;ay &s;uch Men are to be accounted private and incon&s;iderable, the Charge cannot be true: To &s;uch I &s;hall only &s;ay, that the An|ce&s;ters of the&s;e Gentlemen were Members of An|tient Parliaments, and of &s;uch Parliaments as would have been a&s;ham'd of committing &s;uch an Ab&s;ur|dity as to Impri&s;on the Freeholders of <HI>England</HI> for a peaceable Petition.</P>
<P>As to the Matter of the Petition, and which &s;ome People &s;ay was a Banter, the turning their Loyal Addre&s;&s;es into Bills of Supply. The Gentlemen ought to have had liberty to explain them&s;elves, which if they had done, I am of the opinion that it wou'd have been to this purpo&s;e, that they thought it was proper <HI>the Hou&s;e &s;hould &s;peedily &s;up|ply the KING &s;o with Money, as that he might be Enabled to Defend our</HI> Prote&s;tant <HI>Neighbours from the Encroachments of</HI> France; and not to lo&s;e their time in addre&s;&s;ing the King in matters of le&s;s moment.</P>
<P>I &s;hall conclude with this &s;hort Animadver&s;ion by way of Remark, and let all Men judge of the ju&s;tne&s;s of the Ob&s;ervation.</P>
