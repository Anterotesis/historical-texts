<HEAD>REASONS
Concerning the
Immediate Demoli&s;hing
OF
DUNKIRK, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>THEY who undertake &s;o unpo|pular
an Argument as this of
the Demoli&s;hing of <HI>Dunkirk</HI> is,
mu&s;t be prepared to be very ill
treated by tho&s;e who are on the other
&s;ide; who, be&s;ides what Arguments they
think fit to u&s;e, are always ready to quar|rel
with what they may not approve.</P>
<P>Be it known to &s;uch, That the Writer
of the&s;e Sheets was ever a Prote&s;tant,
<PB N="4" REF="3">
and truly jealous for the Prote&s;tants a|gain&s;t
the Popi&s;h Intere&s;t: He has been
&s;o far from a French Party, that he was
ever again&s;t all Parties: And as for the
Pretender, he has willingly and unfeign|edly
abjur'd him.</P>
<P>Yet he &s;ees many Rea&s;ons why he can|not
agree with the common Opinion of
tho&s;e who&s;e Judgment he may in other
Things acknowledge to be much better
than his own, in that he cannot think
it &s;afe for the Government of <HI>Great Bri|tain</HI>
to go &s;o ha&s;tily as the People &s;eem
to de&s;ire, and ju&s;t at this time, about
the Demoli&s;hing <HI>Dunkirk.</HI></P>
<P>The Demoli&s;hing <HI>Dunkirk</HI> having been
agreed upon in the late Treaty with the
French King, and made a part of the
Peace concluded at <HI>&V;trecht,</HI> it is no lon|ger
a Que&s;tion, whether the French are
obliged to Demoli&s;h it or not, if the
Queen of <HI>Great Britain</HI> in&s;i&s;ts upon it;
None will contend this part (<HI>viz.</HI>) that the
French mu&s;t and ought to perform what is
&s;o agreed; and the Town is put into the
Queens Hand, to a&s;&s;ure Her Maje&s;ty, on
the part of <HI>France,</HI> that it &s;hall be done
when required.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="4">
There are not the &s;ame Rea&s;ons, or
the &s;ame Obligations upon Her Maje&s;ty
to Demoli&s;h <HI>Dunkirk,</HI> as there are upon
the French King to do it if Her Maje&s;ty
requires it; on the contrary, there are
divers very good Rea&s;ons to be given why
Her Maje&s;ty may not think it proper to
&s;uffer the &s;aid Fortifications to be YET
Demoli&s;hed.</P>
<P>The Enquiry therefore into the Vali|dity
of the Treaty, and how far the
French King is oblig'd to Demoli&s;h <HI>Dun|kirk</HI>
if we in&s;i&s;t upon it, is not the Ca&s;e;
but the Que&s;tion before us is, WHE|THER,
as <HI>Dunkirk</HI> is now in Her Ma|je&s;ty's
hand, and was given as a Pledge
or Security to <HI>Great-Britain</HI> for the Per|formance
of tho&s;e things &s;tipulated by
<HI>France</HI> on one hand, and to impower the
Queen to do Her Subjects Right in the
<HI>Netherlands,</HI> on the other hand; I &s;ay,
whether it con&s;i&s;ts with common Pru|dence
to give up this Pledge before that
Safety and Advantage which it was put
into our hands to obtain and &s;ecure, be
obtain'd and &s;ecured.</P>
<P>To enter fairly into this Argument,
we mu&s;t enquire, what were the true Mo|tives
upon which the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Court took
<HI>Dunkirk</HI> into Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion? and why Her
<PB N="6" REF="5">
Maje&s;ty in&s;i&s;ted &s;o &s;teadily upon that Po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion
preliminary &s;o much as to any
Engagement of Treating about a Peace?
And perhaps the &s;etting this matter right,
may go a great way to the &s;atisfying
tho&s;e People who now argue &s;o hotly
on this Point, and to the reconciling them
to the Rea&s;ons which &s;hall be aftetwards
given.</P>
<P>It is true that, in the fir&s;t place, the
Re&s;titution of <HI>Dunkirk</HI> was in&s;i&s;ted upon
as a Te&s;timony to be given by the <HI>French</HI>
King, that he was truly de&s;irous of Peace;
and &s;incerely re&s;olved to give Satisfaction
to Her Maje&s;ty and Her Allies; and,
That Her Maje&s;ty &s;hould be Arbitre&s;s of
what &s;hould or &s;hould not be e&s;teem'd
Satisfaction when a Treaty &s;hould be &s;o
commenc'd.</P>
<P>If in any thing the <HI>French</HI> King had
not comply'd, if he had refu&s;ed to grant
any thing which Her Maje&s;ty judged e&s;|&s;ential
to the Safety and Peace of <HI>Europe,</HI>
either which was in&s;i&s;ted on by the
Queen, or by Her Allies; <HI>Dunkirk</HI> was
deem'd to be a &s;ufficient Satisfaction to
the Queen, and a &s;ufficient Lo&s;s to <HI>France:</HI>
So that leaving <HI>Dunkirk</HI> in Her Maje&s;ty's
hands, he was at liberty to Treat or not
to Treat, Conclude or not Conclude, as
<PB N="7" REF="6">
he thought fit; &s;ince the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of
<HI>Dunkirk</HI> was a thing &s;o con&s;iderable to
us, and in ca&s;e of carrying on the War,
would have been &s;o fatal to <HI>France,</HI> that
it required but a &s;mall Penetration to
know that we had thereby the Key of
<HI>France</HI> on that &s;ide put into our hands,
and could, without any difficulty, have
done what (however talk'd of) had been
found &s;o impracticable to bring to pa&s;s in
22 Years War, (<HI>viz.</HI>) to have carried
the War into the Heart of <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>It &s;hould be next enquired, when the
Article of putting <HI>Dunkirk</HI> into Her Ma|je&s;ty's
hands was in Debate, from who
and from what Foundation came the Ad|dition
of that Clau&s;e, (<HI>viz.</HI>) the Fortifi|cations
to be Demoli&s;hed? Was it from
the <HI>Briti&s;h,</HI> or from the <HI>French,</HI> or on &s;ome
third Intere&s;t, that this part was pro|po&s;ed?</P>
<P>No Man will be &s;o weak as not to al|low,
that if the Town of <HI>Dunkirk,</HI> with
all its Fortifications, Harbours, Peers,
Rice-bank, Citadel, Ba&s;&s;in, <HI>&amp; c.</HI> could
have been obtain'd, and the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion
and Soveraignty of them made over to
the Queen, the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Mini&s;ters would
gladly have accepted it; nor could they
have an&s;wer'd it to God and their Queen
if they had not.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="7">
It was not then the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Mini&s;ters
that demanded the Demoli&s;hing of <HI>Dun|kirk,</HI>
the gaining Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it, was
their Point; which having obtain'd, they
would never, if in their right Mind, have
offer'd the Demoli&s;hing it, if it had not
been in&s;i&s;ted on by the <HI>French.</HI></P>
<P>What Intere&s;t other Nations, our Al|lies,
have in this part, and how far they
would be from being ea&s;y in the Town
of <HI>Dunkirk</HI>'s remaining in <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> hands un|demoli&s;hed,
&s;hall be enquired into after|wards.</P>
<P>But for the pre&s;ent, this brief Ob&s;er|vation
may be drawn from the Premi&s;&s;es,
(<HI>viz.</HI>) As it could not rea&s;onably be our
part to Article for the Demoli&s;hing <HI>Dun|kirk</HI>
when it was put into our hands; &s;o
neither can it be rea&s;onable, that while
we have it in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion we &s;hould be
more in ha&s;te to Demoli&s;h it, than other
Nations.</P>
<P>The Ca&s;e &s;eems very clear, we have
the Town in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion: If it were never
Demoli&s;hed, what can the Hurt be on
our fide? The Damage is to <HI>France,</HI> be|cau&s;e
they are deprived of it; and in ca&s;e
of any future Rupture with us, the Dan|ger
will be to them: But it is a mo&s;t
my&s;terious Sugge&s;tion, that the Fortifica|tions
<PB N="9" REF="8">
of <HI>Dunkirk</HI> &s;hould be dangerous to
us who have them in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>But this My&s;tery may perhaps be un|folded
more ea&s;ily, when the Rea&s;on and
Nature of Things comes to be a little far|ther
enquired into.</P>
<P>It is the Unhappine&s;s of this Nation to
be mi&s;erably divided into Parties; which
Parties, have this one Peculiar which per|haps
di&s;tingui&s;hes them from all that ever
went before them, <HI>viz.</HI> That they agree
in nothing: Many Divi&s;ions have been
in this Nation and other Nations, and
have been carried on to great heights,
even to Blood and War; but &s;till they
determin'd what they differ'd in, and
what they agreed in.</P>
<P>Thus the late Differences between
Church and Di&s;&s;enter, however warmly
they differ'd, even to Per&s;ecution and Suf|fering;
yet they agreed to join again&s;t Po|pery.
The late Differences between <HI>Whig</HI>
and <HI>Tory,</HI> Liberty and Arbitrary Power,
ran very high; but they all join'd again&s;t
Standing Armies, Di&s;pen&s;ing Power, and
the like.</P>
<P>But the People who differ now, &s;eem
to agree in nothing but to Di&s;like and
Oppo&s;e whatever the other Party do, or
e&s;pou&s;e, meerly becau&s;e done and e&s;pou|&s;ed
<PB N="10" REF="9">
by them, without enquiring into the
Rea&s;on and Merit of the Ca&s;e; as if they
were unwilling the oppo&s;ite Party to them
&s;hould have the Reputation of doing what
is right, any more than the Power of do|ing
what is wrong.</P>
<P>But this &s;eems to be a Temper fatal to
the Publick Good, for that it is carried
&s;uch a Length, that the Parties appear
&s;atisfied their Country &s;hould &s;uffer the
want of any Publick Service, rather than
the Party who they oppo&s;e &s;hould be the
In&s;truments in bringing it to pa&s;s.</P>
<P>This Digre&s;&s;ion appears nece&s;&s;ary in this
Place, as it will be hard to give any other
rational Account; for the &s;everal parts of
the Conduct of our People, with relation
to the taking Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, Keeping, and
Demoli&s;hing of <HI>Dunkirk;</HI> and the Sinceri|ty
of the Complainers, mu&s;t &s;uffer great
Reflection if the Particulars are well en|quired
into.</P>
<P>When fir&s;t it was known that <HI>Dunkirk</HI>
was to be depo&s;ited into Her Maje&s;ty's
hands, the Friends of the Managers of
that Affair began to magnify that Acqui|&s;ition,
as a great Point gain'd; <HI>That</HI> it
was a Service to the Kingdom, which
could no other way have been brought to
pa&s;s; <HI>That</HI> it was a &s;ufficient Pledge that
<PB N="11" REF="10">
they &s;hould be &s;incerely dealt with by the
<HI>French</HI> King in the en&s;uing Treaty; and,
<HI>That</HI> it ought to be taken for a Token of
the real Concern the Mini&s;try had for the
Advantage of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> and their Ca|pacity
to &s;hew it.</P>
<P>No &s;ooner was this done, but the other
Party, as if they oppo&s;ed what was done
becau&s;e the other had done it; began im|mediately
to cry it down, to depreciate
the thing it &s;elf, and give a wrong Ac|count
of the Circum&s;tances: They repre|&s;ented
<HI>Dunkirk</HI> as a thing of no great Con|&s;equence;
that as to our having it, it
would co&s;t us more to keep than it was
worth, and would only &s;erve the Mini|&s;try
for a Pretence to keep a Standing
Army on foot, and the like. And as to
the King of <HI>France,</HI> it was no &s;uch migh|ty
Lo&s;s to him; for, as the Town was
to be re&s;tored to him when Demoli&s;hed,
he could ea&s;ily re&s;tore the Works, and
open the Harbour again: But that the
Truth was, he was a-going to let us &s;ee
he did not value it; that he was going to
fortify <HI>Graveling,</HI> and would make it as
Impregnable by Land as <HI>Dunkirk;</HI> and
as to the Harbour, the Engineers had en|gaged
to make it a better, and to have
two foot Water more in the Port than
<PB N="12" REF="11">
in that of <HI>Dunkirk:</HI> So that <HI>Graveling</HI>
would be every thing by Sea that <HI>Dunkirk</HI>
was. The&s;e things were not the Publick
Di&s;cour&s;e of tho&s;e People only, but were
often printed and publi&s;hed in their &s;eve|ral
Pamphlets and News-papers, as may
be proved if there were occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>Now although this needed no other
Confutation than Matter of Fact, <HI>viz.</HI>
the Impracticablene&s;s of the Place (<HI>Grave|ling</HI>)
to make any &s;uch Harbour, and the
reality of this Truth, <HI>viz.</HI> that no &s;uch
thing is attempted, or indeed de&s;ign'd by
the <HI>French;</HI> yet the&s;e Reports have been
indu&s;triou&s;ly &s;pread abroad, and kept up,
tho' contradicted by unconte&s;table Evi|dence;
it being thought needful to le&s;&s;en
the Value of <HI>Dunkirk</HI> in the Eyes of the
People, and con&s;equently to le&s;&s;en the
Merit of tho&s;e who &s;truggled &s;o much to
get it into our hands, and e&s;teem'd it of
&s;o great Advantage to us now it was
obtain'd.</P>
<P>But one would have thought the Te|&s;timony
and Credit of the la&s;t Age &s;hould
have e&s;tabli&s;h'd our Opinion of <HI>Dunkirk</HI>
in the pre&s;ent. When it was Sold by
K. <HI>Charles</HI> II. to the pre&s;ent <HI>French</HI> King,
how was the Politicks of that Reign cen|&s;ured
for it? How is it recorded on &s;eve|ral
<PB N="13" REF="12">
Accounts, as a Mark of Infamy upon
the whole Court, and a Reproach to the
Nation? What has the Memory of the
Lord Chancellor <HI>Hyde</HI> &s;uffer'd for being
the Advi&s;er of it, though he neither was
guilty of it, nor did he forbear mode&s;tly
to oppo&s;e it.</P>
<P>Then <HI>Dunkirk</HI> was called the Key of
Commerce, a Door into <HI>France,</HI> a Muzzle
or a Ring in the No&s;e of the <HI>Flemi&s;h-Lyon;</HI>
its Value counted Ine&s;timable, and the
Nation betray'd in giving it over to the
<HI>French.</HI> It was admirable to &s;ee the Voice
of the Nation &s;o &s;uddenly changed; that
when it was parted with, tho' at a great
Price, it was rai&s;ed up to &s;uch an intole|rable
Rate, and our Lo&s;s e&s;teem'd &s;o Irre|parable;
and yet the Town was of no great
Strength at that time, and the Harbour
of le&s;s Importance than that of <HI>Calais;</HI> as
being capable to receive no Ve&s;&s;els of Bur|then;
and now, on the other hand, when
it is acknowledged to be the mo&s;t Important
Place on this Side the World, the Portable
to receive great Fleets, and to fit out Expe|ditions
to Invade us; the Town it &s;elf Im|pregnable,
and a Terror to all its Neigh|bours;
yet, on a &s;udden, the Price is fal|len
among our States-Men, and it is not
<PB N="14" REF="13">
worth our taking, tho' we were to have
it, as it were, for Nothing.</P>
<P>This is an unan&s;werable Evidence of
the Power of our Divi&s;ions, and how the
Prejudices that are among us Influence
our Judgments to Argue even again&s;t
Light, and again&s;t the Conviction of our
own Rea&s;on.</P>
<P>We can hardly expre&s;s how much we
are beholding in this Matter to the <HI>worthy</HI>
Mr. <HI>Steele,</HI> the publi&s;her of the <HI>Guardian,</HI>
No. 128. I will not be &s;o unju&s;t to him as
to call him the Author; who has effectu|ally
&s;et us right in this Matter, and has
re&s;cued the Town and Harbour of <HI>Dun|kirk</HI>
from the depreciating Arts of our
Party-Men, who, it was to be fear'd,
would have brought it at la&s;t &s;o low, that
we might have been made believe the
King of <HI>France,</HI> if we &s;hould offer to give
it him again, would not accept of it.</P>
<P>But the <HI>Guardian</HI> has taken the Cou|rage
to do Ju&s;tice to the <HI>Dunkirkers,</HI> and of
Con&s;equence to the Mini&s;try, in &s;ecuring
&s;uch a Place in the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Queen;
for he has told us expre&s;ly, that to take
<HI>Dunkirk</HI> from the <HI>French</HI> is removing
<HI>France</HI> two or three hundred Miles fur|ther
from us; that they have not any Port
where they can &s;it out any Fleet till they
<PB N="15" REF="14">
come to <HI>Bre&s;t;</HI> that it is of the la&s;t Con|&s;equence
to <HI>Britain</HI> that it &s;hould no
more be in the <HI>French</HI> Power, that the In|jury
we have received from them is In|e&s;timable.
His words follow.</P>
<P>&startq;That when <HI>Dunkirk</HI> is demoli&s;hed,
the Power of <HI>France,</HI> on that Side,
&s;hould it ever be turned again&s;t us,
will be removed &s;everal hundred Miles
further off of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> than it is
at pre&s;ent. Vide <HI>Guardian,</HI> No. 128.</P>
<P>As this is an undoubted Te&s;timony gi|ven
to the Zeal of the Mini&s;try, in taking
hold of the pre&s;ent Conjuncture, to get
that Important Fortre&s;s into our Hands,
and is the greate&s;t and mo&s;t ju&s;t Panegy|rick
which Mr. <HI>Steele</HI> ever made upon any
great Action in the World, and which,
no doubt, he did in Honour to the Queen,
and the pre&s;ent Government; and that
the &s;aid Mr. <HI>Steele</HI> has gained the ju&s;t Ap|probation
of all her Maje&s;ty's good Sub|jects
for &s;o doing, &s;o it is a fair Confuta|tion
of all tho&s;e weak Things which had
been advanced by a Party among us, in
Prejudice of the late Negociations; but
above all, that it is an unan&s;werable Argu|ment
again&s;t our too &s;oon parting with,
<PB N="16" REF="15">
or too ha&s;tily Demoli&s;hing this Important
Place, which is of &s;uch Con&s;equence to
the Nation; and I cannot doubt, but
Mr. <HI>Steele</HI> did it that Ju&s;tice with this
Intent. For it is impo&s;&s;ible a Man of
his Penetration, and of his exqui&s;ite Po|liticks,
could Argue for our immediate
putting the Place out of our Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion,
becau&s;e it was a Place of very great Con|&s;equence,
and that the Security of <HI>Great-Britain</HI>
depended on it. This will always
be allow'd to be a good Argument with
any true <HI>Britain,</HI> why we &s;hould get it
into our Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and why we &s;hould
keep it now we have it, at lea&s;t till we
are effectually Secured; but it will be very
hard to make this pa&s;s with any rea&s;ona|ble
Man for an Argument, why we &s;hould
pull it to pieces, and give it away again
to <HI>France;</HI> and, God be prai&s;ed, tho&s;e
who are of that mind have not the Town
in their Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, nor the Power to de|&s;troy
our Security, before the Thing to be
Secur'd by it be actually obtain'd.</P>
<P>Having therefore &s;o good a Te&s;timony
to the Value of the Thing, we &s;hall not
need to &s;ay any thing to do Ju&s;tice to
tho&s;e Councils who manag'd <HI>France</HI> &s;o, as
to get a Town of that Con&s;equence put
into our Hands.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="16">
But to return to the Parties among us,
and the De&s;igns which we now &s;ee mana|ged
by them, one again&s;t another. When
they found that depreciating and run|ning
down the Value of <HI>Dunkirk</HI> would
do them no Service, that their own Com|plaints
formerly, when it was fir&s;t parted
with to the <HI>French,</HI> contradicted it, and
that the real Importance of the Place was
&s;o well known to every one, that it be|came
ridiculous to attempt the making Peo|ple
believe otherwi&s;e; they took other
Mea&s;ures.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, They endeavoured to make it
be believed, that we had not really gotten
Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it, that the <HI>French</HI> held the
principal Parts of it, that the Garri&s;on was
re&s;train'd by the Burghers, that the <HI>French</HI>
could Di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;s them of it when they
plea&s;ed; and the like.</P>
<P>This al&s;o their <HI>Flying-Po&s;t</HI> and other
Libels Publi&s;hed for a certain Truth,
tho' the Fact was quite otherwife from
the beginning. The <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Troops being
put into an immediate Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of every
part of the Town, the Cittadel, Rice-Bank,
all the Gates, the two Peers, every Out|work,
and al&s;o of Fort-Louis, at a good
di&s;tance from the Town; &s;o that there
was not the lea&s;t part left in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion
of the <HI>French,</HI> nor were any <HI>French</HI> Troops
<PB N="18" REF="17">
left in the Place, except a few Ma|rines,
who were appointed to guard the
old unrigged Gallies and Men of War
which lay in the Ba&s;in, and which could
not be carryed away, and which being
but meer Hulks, it was nece&s;&s;ary to keep
a &s;mall Guard upon them, to keep the
People of the Town from pulling them
in pieces.</P>
<P>A little Time therefore di&s;covering the
Truth, this Shift would &s;erve no longer,
and &s;o was abandon'd for a quite con|trary
extream; for, on a &s;udden, the very
&s;ame People who had run down <HI>Dunkirk,</HI>
as good for nothing, or <HI>to u&s;e their own
Words,</HI> of no great Con&s;equence, not
worth having, and the like; turn'd their
Tale, and <HI>Dunkirk</HI> was now of the utmo&s;t
Con&s;equence in the World.</P>
<P>It was with &s;ome Impatience, that the
<HI>On-Looking</HI> and Impartial part of Man|kind
waited to know what they would
infer from this new Opinion, for every
one allow'd they were now in the right;
That <HI>Dunkirk</HI> was of the la&s;t Importance,
no Body could que&s;tion; But what could
they draw from thence?</P>
<P>To &s;ay that therefore the Mini&s;try had
acted Wi&s;ely in getting &s;o great and &s;o
terrible a Place out of the Hands of &s;o
<PB N="19" REF="18">
dangerous a Per&s;on as the <HI>French</HI> King,
without Blood or Blows, to have it qui|etly
Surrendered and put into our Hands
as a pledge of Peace; that a Fortre&s;s which
had been &s;o fatal to us, was now &s;ecured,
whatever might happen, from ever doing
<HI>Britain</HI> any more Mi&s;chief; this went
again&s;t their Nature, and the very Thoughts
of it made their Party-Blood run cold
within them.</P>
<P>As this therefore could not be expected
from them, &s;o no Man in the World
could ever have believed, that from the
Acknowledgment of its Importance, could
be drawn an Argument for our throwing
it out of our Hands.</P>
<P>If they had &s;aid they would have it
Demoli&s;hed, becau&s;e the <HI>Dutch</HI> are not
willing we &s;hould keep it; becau&s;e the
<HI>Flemings</HI> are not willing to have us be
&s;o much their Ma&s;ters; becau&s;e the Em|peror
does not care to Tru&s;t us with it;
becau&s;e by it you are able to E&s;tabli&s;h
the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Trade in <HI>Flanders,</HI> whether
the <HI>States-General</HI> approve of it or no.
The&s;e are Rea&s;ons which have &s;ome Force
in them, and which out of the Mouth
of a <HI>Dutchman,</HI> or an <HI>Imperiali&s;t,</HI> would
be very Rational. But for <HI>Engli&s;hmen</HI> to
Argue thus has &s;omething unnatural in
<PB N="20" REF="19">
it, and looks as if tho&s;e People had more
regard to the Intere&s;t of <HI>Holland,</HI> or the
<HI>Emperor,</HI> than to their own Country.</P>
<P>But &s;o it is; and let there be Rea&s;on
in it or no Rea&s;on in it, force of Argu|ment
or no force of Argument, we mu&s;t
give them leave to make it popular, that
<HI>Dunkirk</HI> mu&s;t immediately be Demo|li&s;hed,
and given back to the <HI>French;</HI>
becau&s;e it is of the greate&s;t Importance
to us in the World; which, on the con|trary,
<HI>we &s;ay</HI> is the very Rea&s;on why it
&s;hould not be Demoli&s;hed till all tho&s;e
Things are &s;ecured and obtained for
which it was at fir&s;t put into our Hands.
And whatever the Clamour of the&s;e Men
may be, it is &s;till hoped the Government,
who&s;e Bu&s;ine&s;s it is not to do what the&s;e
People &s;eek, but what it is rea&s;onable
and ju&s;t they &s;hould do for the Publick
Good, will con&s;ider well what other
Things, ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to be done
for the good of the Nation, ought to be
fini&s;hed, before <HI>Dunkirk</HI> be Demoli&s;hed.</P>
<P>And that we may not be amu&s;ed with
Generals, any more on one Side than
another, it may be very u&s;eful to &s;et
down &s;ome particular Rea&s;ons why <HI>Dun|kirk</HI>
ought not yet to be Demoli&s;hed; if
the other People can a&s;&s;ign better Rea|&s;ons
<PB N="21" REF="20">
why it &s;hould be immediately done
the World will ea&s;ily be convinced; and,

<P>Be&s;ides what has been &s;aid of the Rea|&s;ons
why <HI>Dunkirk</HI> was Depo&s;ited by the
<HI>French</HI> in the Hands of Her Maje&s;ty, at
the beginning of the Treaty; it is to be
enquired what other Rea&s;ons there were
why Her Maje&s;ty in&s;i&s;ted on that Surren|der.
I &s;hall put them all together.</P>
<P>I. The Rea&s;ons which re&s;pected <HI>France.</HI></P>

<P>Putting the Sincerity of the <HI>French</HI>
King, in his Propo&s;als for a Treaty,

the Preliminaries before the Treaty was
concluded. A Security for the Perfor|mance
of the Treaty it &s;elf, of which this
was an effectual Preliminary.</P>
<P>The&s;e were the Rea&s;ons on the <HI>French</HI>
King's part, in general, why he &s;hould
Surrender <HI>Dunkirk</HI> to the Allies.</P>
<P>But the&s;e were not the Rea&s;ons why
<HI>Dunkirk</HI> &s;hould be Depo&s;ited in the Hands
of the Queen of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> more than
any other of the Allies: The Rea&s;ons for
that were &s;uch as the&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="21">
1. That the Queen of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI>
who had given her Opinion, and declared
her Re&s;olution for a Treaty of Peace, and
had &s;ignified &s;o much to her Allies, might
be very well a&s;&s;ured that the Satisfaction
which her Maje&s;ty was re&s;olved to en|deavour
to procure for her &s;aid Allies,
and which <HI>France</HI> had propo&s;ed to give;
&s;hould be really and <HI>Bona fide</HI> performed
on the part of <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>2. That the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Commerce which
remained un&s;ettled in the <HI>Low-Countries,</HI>
and which the <HI>Dutch,</HI> by rea&s;on of the
large extent of their Barrier in <HI>Flanders,</HI>
had the power to interrupt, might not
be &s;o much at the Mercy either of the
<HI>Dutch,</HI> or the <HI>Emperor,</HI> as otherwi&s;e it
would be.</P>
<P>From a further Examination of the&s;e
Particulars, it will appear, that there are
very good and &s;ufficient Rea&s;ons why
the Queen of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> ought not to
Demoli&s;h <HI>Dunkirk,</HI> or part with that
Power which is in Her Hands, to do
Her&s;elf and Her Subjects Right, as well
in the Matter of Commerce, as of other
Things, till tho&s;e Things are fully &s;ettled
to Her Satisfaction. Let us enquire into
them more particularly.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="22">
The Rea&s;on why the Demoli&s;hing of
<HI>Dunkirk</HI> was limited to a Time, was on a
Suppo&s;ition that the Peace would have been
General, and that the <HI>Emperor</HI> &s;hould
accept &s;uch Conditions as were judged
rea&s;onable by the other Powers then in
Alliance with him. This his Imperial
Maje&s;ty has not thought fit to do; but
the War is going on: If, on the one hand,
the Arms of <HI>France</HI> are like to be Victo|rious,
the Queen has no tye upon the
<HI>French,</HI> to bring them to grant Terms
of Accommodation to <HI>Germany,</HI> and to
re&s;tore their Conque&s;t, but the keeping
the Town of <HI>Dunkirk</HI> in her Hands;
which the <HI>French</HI> will be very loth to
&s;ubmit to or &s;uffer; for it is a gro&s;s vul|gar
Mi&s;take, to think that not to Demo|li&s;h
<HI>Dunkirk</HI> is a favour to <HI>France;</HI> and we
&s;hall &s;oon find the King of <HI>France</HI> in&s;i&s;t
upon its being Demoli&s;hed, &s;ince it is out
of his Hand, if he &s;hould but imagine
that the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> De&s;ign to keep it.</P>
<P>On the other hand, while the War is
continued between the <HI>Emperor</HI> and <HI>France,</HI>
it may be po&s;&s;ible, tho' not at all proba|ble,
that the <HI>Emperor</HI>'s Arms may be Suc|ce&s;sful:
If &s;uch an unlikely Thing &s;hould
happen, let any one judge whether it
were proper that her Maje&s;ty &s;hould be
<PB N="24" REF="23">
quite &s;hut out of <HI>Flanders,</HI> and have no
other Influence on Affairs than what
&s;hould be at the good liking of either
Party.</P>
<P>For which Rea&s;on, I cannot think any
Man that has the Honour and Intere&s;t of
<HI>Great-Britain</HI> at Heart, can de&s;ire that
this Important Pledge of <HI>Europe</HI>'s Peace
ought to be put out of Her Maje&s;ty's Hand,
till the <HI>Emperor</HI> and the <HI>French</HI> King
have decided their Quarrel, and till the
Peace of <HI>Europe</HI> is compleatly E&s;tabli&s;hed:
And this is one Rea&s;on.</P>
<P>2. The Treaties of Barrier, and other
Engagements between the Queen of <HI>Great-Britain</HI>
and the <HI>States-General,</HI> of which
&s;o much &s;tir has been made and by
which our Trade to <HI>Flanders</HI> is to be &s;et|tled
and regulated, neither are, nor can
be yet, nor perhaps for &s;ome con&s;iderable
time made &s;o Effectual, as that we may
be able to &s;ay we &s;hall have a fair and
equal Regulation of Commerce in <HI>Flan|ders.</HI>
The Refractory and Di&s;obliging
Behaviour of the <HI>Flemings,</HI> even while
our Troops have been in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of
their Country. The Conduct of the
Council of State there, while the Civil
Government has been provi&s;ionally in
the Hands of the Queen, and the <HI>States-General.</HI>
<PB N="25" REF="24">
The&s;e all give us Rea&s;on to &s;ee,
that we have nothing to expect from
them but what we have Power to ob|tain,
by doing our &s;elves Ju&s;tice. How
far the <HI>Dutch</HI> will do us Ju&s;tice in &s;uch
part as &s;hall be in their Hands, I will not
undertake to determine beforehand, but
no true <HI>Britain</HI> will contend that we
ought not to leave the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Commerce
in <HI>Flanders</HI> at the Mercy either of one or
other: And this is a &s;econd Rea&s;on why
I think we ought not to dive&s;t our&s;elves
of &s;o great an Advantage as the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion
of <HI>Dunkirk</HI> is, by which we may be al|ways
in a Condition to do our &s;elves
right, if others refu&s;e it, till we &s;ee our
Commerce &s;etled, and the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Trade
in <HI>Flanders</HI> regulated upon an equal Foot
with the <HI>Dutch,</HI> as it was agreed to be, and
as it is, but ju&s;t and equal that it &s;hould be.</P>
<P>If any one think that this Rea&s;on is
not good, I refer them back to the Par|liament,
who were &s;o &s;en&s;ible of the
Value of our Trade there, and of the un|equal
Terms we &s;hould &s;tand upon, if
we were quite dive&s;ted of a Footing in
<HI>Flanders,</HI> that they Addre&s;&s;ed Her Maje&s;ty
not to part with any Thing She was po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed
of in <HI>Flanders,</HI> till the Trade of
Her Subjects was effectually Secured.
What tho&s;e People mean, and who&s;e In|tere&s;t
<PB N="26" REF="25">
they are acting, contrary to that of
their own Country, who are for having
Her Maje&s;ty give up and Demoli&s;h <HI>Dun|kirk</HI>
before the&s;e Things are &s;ettled, and
before &s;ufficient Security for our Trade
is made and obtain'd will ea&s;ily appear;
nor can they ever An&s;wer the Charge of
referring the Intere&s;t of the <HI>Dutch,</HI> and
the <HI>Emperor,</HI> to that of their own Country.
The Re&s;olution of the Parliament in this
Ca&s;e, is as follows.</P>
<P><HI>Re&s;olved,</HI> &startq;That an humble Addre&s;s be
pre&s;ented to Her Maje&s;ty, That She will
be plea&s;ed to take Care, that the Towns in
<HI>Flanders,</HI> in Her Maje&s;ty's Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, be
not evacuated, till tho&s;e who are to have
the Sovereignty of the <HI>Spani&s;h Netherlands</HI>
agree to &s;uch Articles for regulating of
Trade, as may put the Subjects of <HI>Great-Britain</HI>
upon an equal Foot with tho&s;e of
any other Nation. <HI>Vide Votes, 22 June,</HI> 1713.&endq;</P>
<P>After &s;uch an Authority as this, What
Man can have the Face to &s;ay, the BRI|TISH
NATION EXPECTS <HI>Dunkirk</HI> to
be immediately Demoli&s;hed? the <HI>Hou&s;e of
Commons</HI> is the Repre&s;entative of the
BRITISH NATION, and, it is plain,
they expect the contrary, and have Ad|dre&s;&s;ed
Her Maje&s;ty to the contrary;
and, I doubt not, but if &s;ome Powers
go on as they have begun, and continue
<PB N="27" REF="26">
to &s;how the little Inclination they have
to do Ju&s;tice to Her Maje&s;ty, or Her
Subjects, the <HI>Hou&s;e of Commons</HI> may come,
in time, to Addre&s;s Her Maje&s;ty not to
&s;uffer <HI>Dunkirk</HI> to be Demoli&s;hed at all, till
Right be done; at lea&s;t, they would have
little cau&s;e to Thank tho&s;e who &s;hould go
about to Demoli&s;h it, till all that we
ought to expect be done, and the Liberty
and Conditions of our Trade in <HI>Flanders,</HI>
&s;ufficiently and effectually Secured to us.</P>
<P>3. The Third Ca&s;e is this: The Po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion
of <HI>Dunkirk</HI> being, as was &s;aid, a
Pledge of the Sincerity of the <HI>French</HI> King,
in the Affair of the Treaty, &s;o was it al&s;o
a Pledge of the Conditions agreed on by
His mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ty to Her Maje&s;ty
the Queen of <HI>Great-Britain;</HI> and for this
Rea&s;on, it cannot be EXPECTED, even by
His mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ty him&s;elf, that
Her Maje&s;ty &s;hould &s;uffer <HI>Dunkirk</HI> to be
Demoli&s;hed till the Conditions of the &s;aid
Treaty, on the part of His &s;aid mo&s;t
Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ty, &s;hall be fully Executed
in all the Parts thereof; particularly the
Treaty of Commerce, <HI>which having met with
&s;ome Ob&s;truction here,</HI> has not been brought
into Practice, and cannot be for &s;ome
time, at lea&s;t, not till the Meeting of
the next Parliament. Now, tho' the
<HI>French</HI> King indeed might Complain, and
<PB N="28" REF="27">
&s;ay, that he being ready to execute the
Treaty upon his part, and the delay be|ing
on the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Side only, it was not
rea&s;onable to keep His Town of <HI>Dunkirk</HI>
from Him, or to delay the Demoli&s;hing
of it upon an occa&s;ion which had its
Original wholly in our &s;elves, and might
therefore Demand that it be immediately
Demoli&s;hed, according to the Treaty;
Yet it is unaccountable how this can be
an Argument on our Side, and that the
People of <HI>Britain</HI> &s;hould be impatient to
put out of their own Hand what is their
Security, for the performance of the Terms
of <HI>Peace</HI> and <HI>Trade;</HI> and the unaccounta|blene&s;s
of this confirms what is before
&s;ugge&s;ted, <HI>viz.</HI> That the&s;e Men are car|rying
on the Intere&s;t, of another People,
not of their own Country.</P>
<P><HI>There is no doubt,</HI> but the <HI>Dutch,</HI> the
<HI>Emperor,</HI> the <HI>Flemings,</HI> and all that are in
their Intere&s;t, would be glad to have <HI>Dun|kirk</HI>
out of Her Maje&s;ty's Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion;
if it had been in their Choice, it &s;hould
never have come into Her Hands; nor
can they be much blamed for it, there
are many Things to be &s;aid for it on their
Side.</P>
<P>But what an <HI>Engli&s;hman</HI> can &s;ay for it,
why he &s;hould de&s;ire it, e&s;pecially before
every Thing, for which it is a Security,
<PB N="29" REF="28">
is really Secured, is an unaccountable My|&s;tery,
and can never be unfolded, but
very much to the Di&s;advantage of the
People who are concerned in it: What
can a Subject of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> Plead, why
he &s;hould be in &s;uch great ha&s;t to have
<HI>Dunkirk</HI> Demoli&s;hed? If he has the true
Intere&s;t of his Country at his Heart, he
cannot but de&s;ire <HI>Great-Britain</HI> &s;hould
keep the Hold it has of any Foreign Power,
whereby it may oblige them to do his
Country Ju&s;tice, <HI>till that Ju&s;tice is obtain'd.</HI></P>
<P>There is but one Thing left to tho&s;e
People to Plead, and this, altho' they
will &s;ecretly acknowledge that they have
it in their View, yet they care not to
acknowledge they entertain any Thought
&s;o bad in their Hearts, <HI>viz.</HI> That they
&s;ugge&s;t <HI>France,</HI> and the pre&s;ent Govern|ment,
to be &s;o much in one Intere&s;t, that
this Important Fortre&s;s &s;hall be again put
into the Hands of the King of <HI>France,</HI> or
Subjected to his Intere&s;t upon all Occa|&s;ions,
tho' in prejudice of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> In|tere&s;t;
but this is &s;o unnatural a Thing,
I care not to &s;ay more of it here; it were
to be wi&s;hed there were no Cau&s;e to have
&s;aid &s;o much.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, <HI>the Ca&s;e is this,</HI> as to
<HI>Dunkirk:</HI> It is our Security for the Per|formance
of the Articles of <HI>Peace.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="29">
It is <HI>Europe</HI>'s Security, that <HI>France</HI> &s;hall
give good Terms of <HI>Peace</HI> to the Hou&s;e
of <HI>Au&s;tria,</HI> tho' his Arms &s;hould be Vic|torious</P>
<P>It is the Security of our Commerce in
<HI>Flanders,</HI> which is not yet &s;etled.</P>
<P>And till all the&s;e Things are brought to
a Conclu&s;ion, it would be mo&s;t unrea&s;ona|ble
to EXPECT, that <HI>Dunkirk</HI> &s;hould be
Demoli&s;hed.</P>

telling the Government, that the <HI>Bri|ti&s;h

be <HI>IMMEDIATELY</HI> Demoli&s;hed, was guil|ty
of the following Crimes.</P>
<P>1. <HI>In&s;olence,</HI> and want both of Manners

Mutiny and Di&s;affection, when there has
not been the lea&s;t occa&s;ion of Di&s;content

<P>4. <HI>Ab&s;urdity,</HI> in Arguing for that, which
it is the mo&s;t rea&s;onable Thing in the
World, that every true <HI>Britain</HI> &s;hould Ar|gue

1. <HI>In&s;olence, and want of Manners and

to what is to be found in the general
Conver&s;ation of tho&s;e Men who are &s;o

Argument they u&s;e for the more immedi|ate
Demoli&s;hing <HI>Dunkirk, viz.</HI> Their Di|&s;tru&s;t
of the Queen Her&s;elf: and I do
them no wrong when I &s;ay, that if in

makes them &s;o unea&s;ie about <HI>Dunkirk,</HI> and
if they dare not tru&s;t the Queen with the
keeping it, they will not refrain to An&s;wer
readily and plainly, <HI>No.</HI> That the Con|cern

the&s;e Men them&s;elves; and it cannot be
&s;poken without great Re&s;entment in the
Minds of all her Maje&s;ty's true and faith|ful

the nice&s;t Reprover, as to his Veracity.
That the <HI>Guardian</HI> has not taken this
Care, let the World judge when they read
his &s;aid Paper, <HI>Guardian</HI> No. 128. <HI>Aug.</HI> 7.
<HI>The Briti&s;h Nation expects the IMMEDIATE
Demoli&s;hing of</HI> Dunkirk; when at the &s;ame
time he could not but know, that the
Parliament, the two Hou&s;es of Lords and
Commons, which may be more properly
called the <HI>Briti&s;h Nation</HI> than any Body
of People who&s;e A&s;&s;ent could be obtain'd
to that A&s;&s;ertion, and that the&s;e did not
EXPECT it: If then I prove that the
Parliament did not Expect it, I hope I
may be allow'd to &s;ay, with as much De|cency
as I can, That what the <HI>Guardian</HI>
has &s;aid, is FALSE.</P>
<P>Now that the Parliament did not Ex|pect
it, appears,</P>
<P>1. By the afore&s;aid Addre&s;s to her
Maje&s;ty, to keep Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of what &s;he
held in <HI>Flanders</HI> till the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Trade was
&s;ettled and &s;ecured.</P>
<P>2. By the Parliament granting Mony
to Sub&s;i&s;t the Garri&s;on of <HI>Dunkirk</HI> to next
<HI>Chri&s;tmas.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="33">
It cannot be po&s;&s;ible that the Parlia|ment
EXPECTED <HI>Dunkirk</HI> &s;hould be
immediately Demoli&s;hed, and at the &s;ame
time gave Mony to pay the Garri&s;on
that was to keep it till <HI>Chri&s;tmas</HI> next;
that were to make them EXPECT one
thing, and DIRECT another.</P>
<P>What can be more Convincing than
this? And how was it po&s;&s;ible the Au|thor
of the <HI>Guardian</HI> could be guilty of
&s;o wide a Step from the Honour and
Truth which ought to be the denomina|ting
Quality of a Gentleman?</P>
<P>Can it be pleaded, that the Parliament
is not to be called the <HI>Briti&s;h Nation?</HI>
Let him tell us then, who are the <HI>Briti&s;h
Nation;</HI> and let him tell us, how he a&s;|&s;um'd
&s;o much upon Truth and Honour
as to &s;ay the <HI>Briti&s;h Nation,</HI> when he
knew he &s;poke but the Sence of a Party,
that Party but few, and that few Ig|norant
of the true Rea&s;ons why <HI>Dun|kirk</HI>
was not yet to be Demoli&s;hed; nay
it is rather to be feared, he gave the De|nomination
of the <HI>Briti&s;h Nation</HI> to his
own grave Self, and a little Party of a
Party who&s;e Idol he was fond of appear|ing
to be, and that he is &s;o far from being
able to prove what he a&s;&s;erts, <HI>viz.</HI> that
the <HI>Briti&s;h Nation</HI> expects, <HI>&amp; c.</HI> that he
cannot prove he had any Authority, but
<PB N="35" REF="34">
from his own Notion, to publi&s;h any
thing of that nature in the Names of any
part of the <HI>Briti&s;h Nation.</HI></P>
<P>There has not been &s;o accumulated a
Guilt in any Forgery publi&s;hed in this
Age, by which a Man who was thought
to be a Gentleman, however at this time
he had de&s;cended to the Rank of a De|ceiver,
could ever have Impo&s;ed upon a
Nation as he has done; and as he promi|&s;es
him&s;elf to be a Member of Parliament
in the pre&s;ent Election, it is not doubted
but that Honorable Hou&s;e will do Ju&s;tice
in the Ca&s;e when it comes before them.</P>
<P>3. The next Charge upon the Publi&s;h|er
of that Letter in the <HI>Guardian,</HI> is <HI>Se|dition.</HI>
It is true the Charge is high, and
but one Step &s;hort of <HI>Trea&s;on;</HI> and ought
to be well grounded before it be laid
home to a Per&s;on. I take <HI>Sedition</HI> $o
con&s;i&s;t, <HI>among other things,</HI> of this; <HI>(viz.)
Spreading groundle&s;s and fal&s;e Sugge&s;tions
among the People, knowing tho&s;e Sugge&s;tions
to be fal&s;e,</HI> with De&s;ign <HI>to amu&s;e the &s;aid
People, and &s;tir them up to Di&s;content at the
Government they live under.</HI></P>
<P>That the Sugge&s;tion &s;pread by the
<HI>Guardian</HI> was <HI>fal&s;e</HI> and <HI>groundle&s;s,</HI> I think
is made evident, and cannot be deny'd:
How the <HI>Guardian</HI> will come off from
the la&s;t part, <HI>viz.</HI> that this was &s;pread
<PB N="36" REF="35">
abroad among the People, to &s;tir them
up to Murmur at the Goverment becau&s;e
<HI>Dunkirk</HI> was not immediately Demoli&s;h|ed,
he be&s;t knows. The be&s;t way that
I know to clear him is, to have him tell
us what other End he could have in it,
and then prove he had &s;uch Ends as he
propo&s;es. It is very plain, the Publi&s;h|ing
it was to &s;tir up the People to Cla|mour
and Di&s;content; and what el&s;e is
the Repetition every Day in the <HI>Flying-Post,</HI>
viz. <HI>Dunkirk is not yet begun to be
Demoli&s;hed?</HI> Alas! do the&s;e Scribblers think
to Bully the Queen and the Mini&s;try in|to
the doing it before it is proper to do
it? No, they are not &s;o fooli&s;h; but they
hope to &s;tir up a Clamour among the Peo|ple,
and a general Di&s;content at its not
being done; and this is SEDITION.
Should the Mini&s;try have Weakne&s;s e|nough
to be moved by the&s;e Seditious
Clamours, and fall into the Snare of gi|ving
up the Fortifications of <HI>Dunkirk</HI> to
be Demoli&s;hed, before they had obtained
the Performance of all things for which
<HI>Dunkirk</HI> was a Pledge, the&s;e Men would
be the fir&s;t to fall upon the Mini&s;try for
neglecting the Publick Safety, and for gi|ving
up the Security before the Things
for which it was a Security are obtain'd.
And this brings in the fourth part of the
<PB N="37" REF="36">
Charge on the <HI>Guardian</HI> and his Party,
<HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>4. The ABSURDITY of it. And to
argue coolly on that Head, <HI>What can be
more ab&s;urd,</HI> than the de&s;iring the Mini&s;try
to quit the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the only thing
which is their Security for the making
good the Treaties of Peace and Com|merce,
and their Security again&s;t Mi&s;con|&s;tructions
in the Executing the &s;aid Trea|ties
on the Part of <HI>France?</HI> Would they
not all &s;ay, that this was to have no Treaty
at all, and that it was to put it out of
our Power to oblige the <HI>French</HI> King to
the Performance? And what Treatment
mu&s;t the Mini&s;ters have expected from
the &s;ame Men who now make this Com|plaint,
if they had been &s;o weak to do
thus?</P>
<P>It is &s;aid here, by way of Objection,
That the Time for beginning to Demo|li&s;h
it is &s;tipulated in expre&s;s Terms in
the Treaty; <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>&startq;The mo&s;t Chri&s;tian King &s;hall take
Care, that all the Fortifications of the
City of <HI>Dunkirk</HI> be razed, that the Har|bour
be fill'd up, and that the Sluices
or Moles which &s;erve to clean&s;e the
Harbour be Levelled, and that at the
&s;aid King's own Expence, within the
&s;pace of five Months after the Condi|tions
<PB N="38" REF="37">
of Peace are Concluded and
Signed.&endq;</P>
<P>What can be more again&s;t them than
this Allegation? It is evident this is a Sti|pulation
on the part of <HI>France,</HI> viz. That
he &s;hall not be obliged to begin the Work
&s;ooner; and on the part of the Queen of
<HI>Great-Britain,</HI> That if her Maje&s;ty deman|ded
it, he &s;hould be oblig'd to begin it
&s;o &s;oon: But no way obliging the Queen
of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> that whether all other
Things were done or not, her Maje&s;ty
&s;hould be bound to let it be Demoli&s;hed
&s;o &s;oon.</P>
<P>The very nature of the thing is quite
otherwi&s;e; If a Security be con&s;ign'd over
for the Performance of a Condition, and
any thing happens to delay the Perfor|mance
of that Condition; if the Security
is not to remain, how &s;hall the Perfor|mance
of the Condition be a&s;certain'd to
the Per&s;on to whom it was to be done?</P>
<P>Here are Conditions of the Treaty not
made Effectual, the Treaty of Commerce
is delay'd here; the Emperor is not yet
come into the Peace, by which means the
Government and Trade of the late <HI>Spani&s;h</HI>
now <HI>Imperial Netherlands</HI> is not &s;ettled, or
the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Intere&s;t there &s;ecured: The
Parliament has been &s;o &s;en&s;ible of the
Danger to <HI>Great Britain</HI> from this Po&s;ture
<PB N="39" REF="38">
of Affairs there, that they have de&s;ired
her Maje&s;ty to keep more Footing in
<HI>Flanders,</HI> rather than le&s;s, till that Mat|ter
is &s;ecured: Can it be thought the Par|liament
would have been willing <HI>Dunkirk</HI>
&s;hould have been thrown up, when they
were willing <HI>Newport</HI> and other Towns
&s;hould be po&s;&s;e&s;s'd till the Queen had Sa|tisfaction,
and till our Trade was &s;ecured
on that &s;ide? What Thanks would any
&s;ucceeding Parliament of <HI>Britain</HI> have gi|ven
a Mini&s;try, that when the Hou&s;e of
Commons had de&s;ired her Maje&s;ty to keep
Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of what &s;he held in <HI>Flanders,</HI>
&s;hould give up <HI>Dunkirk,</HI> which was more
than all the re&s;t, and the keeping of which
was the only way to enable Her to keep
all the re&s;t, and more e&s;pecially when the
&s;aid Parliament had made Provi&s;ion of
Mony particularly and expre&s;ly for the
paying the Expence of keeping <HI>Dunkirk</HI>
till <HI>Chri&s;tmas</HI> next, if it &s;hould be needful.</P>
<P><HI>Is not this as much as if the Parliament
had &s;aid to the Queen,</HI> Madam, Since the
Treaty of Commerce has been delay'd, and
mu&s;t of cour&s;e come to be debated by another
Parliament; &s;ince the Emperor has not thought
fit to come into the Peace, by which means the
Government of <HI>Flanders,</HI> &amp;c. is not yet &s;et|tled,
and the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Commerce there is not
regulated; we de&s;ire Your Maje&s;ty to keep the
<PB N="40" REF="39">
Town of <HI>Dunkirk</HI> in your Hands, and not Demoli&s;h
the &s;ame till the Meeting of the next Parliament, and
that it &s;hall be determin'd in Parliament what &s;hall
or may be thought proper to be done with it, whether
Demoli&s;hed or not, as the &s;ituation of Affairs &s;hall
then appear to be; and that Your Maje&s;ty may the
better be Enabled to do this, your Loyal and Faith|ful
Commons have made Provi&s;ion for the Mainte|nance
of the Garri&s;on till that time, or till <HI>Chri&s;t|mas,</HI>
which is &s;uppo&s;ed to be near the time when
another Parliament will a&s;&s;emble.</P>
<P>Let Mr. <HI>Guardian</HI> be the Judge him&s;elf, whe|ther
this be not the true &s;tate of the Ca&s;e, and
whether he has any Wrong done him in expo|&s;ing
what he has publi&s;hed as the greate&s;t Ab|&s;urdity
imaginable.</P>
<P>Thus the Propo&s;al of immediately Demoli&s;h|ing
<HI>Dunkirk,</HI> &s;eems to me to be &s;ufficiently pro|ved,
according to the four Heads above writ|ten,
to be Unmannerly, Fal&s;e, Seditious, and
Ridiculous.</P>
<P>From what has been &s;aid, the Author de&s;ires
to draw &s;ome Inferences, and defend him&s;elf
again&s;t &s;ome other which the Partiality of Man|kind
may be plea&s;ed to draw from it. I begin
with the latter.</P>
<P>1. It does by no means follow from what has
been &s;aid, that <HI>Dunkirk</HI> is not to be Demoli&s;hed
at all.</P>
<P>2. Le&s;s yet does it follow from hence, that
it is to be delivered back to the <HI>French</HI> whole
and undi&s;mantled.</P>
<P>3. And lea&s;t of all does it follow, that it is
to be kept in Concert between <HI>Britain</HI> and
<HI>France</HI> for private De&s;igns too ridiculous as well
as too malicious to be nam'd.</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="40">
The&s;e Things had not been mentioned, but
that the People who began the afore&s;aid Reflecti|ons
have not been backward, however groundle&s;s,
to in&s;i&s;t upon them all, and to make u&s;e of them
upon &s;undry Party-occa&s;ions, as the &s;everal De|&s;igns
now carrying on require.</P>
<P>It can &s;carce be admitted within the Limits of
Charity, to &s;uppo&s;e that any one &s;hould &s;ugge&s;t
Things &s;o unnatural of the pre&s;ent Government;
and we cannot wonder that the wor&s;t and mo&s;t
&s;candalous Things in the World &s;hould be charged
upon them, when we &s;ee Things &s;o criminal, as
well as &s;o contrary to their Intere&s;t, &s;ugge&s;ted.</P>
<P>It would be hard to a&s;&s;ign a Rea&s;on why the
Mini&s;try &s;hould take a Step &s;o dangerous to them|&s;elves,
as well as &s;o di&s;gu&s;ting to the Generality
of the Nation, as that of giving back <HI>Dunkirk</HI>
to the <HI>French</HI> King undemoli&s;h'd: If they are &s;o
much in the <HI>French</HI> Intere&s;t as to be willing to
gratify the <HI>French</HI> King in any thing he de&s;ires,
which is the Crime their Enemies would willing|ly
fa&s;ten upon them, or at lea&s;t would have the
People believe; why then had they not made the
Treaty with him without taking <HI>Dunkirk</HI> at all?
If they had been &s;o willing to have oblig'd the
<HI>French</HI> King, that had been the proper time; then
it might have been pa&s;t over without &s;o much
notice, and they might have accepted of &s;ome
Equivalent le&s;s to the <HI>French</HI> King's Di&s;advan|tage,
and perhaps equally, if not more, &s;ati&s;|factory
to the other Allies than that of <HI>Dunkirk</HI>
Why did they in&s;i&s;t upon &s;uch a Pledge for the
<HI>French</HI> King's Performance of Conditions? A
Pledge, which it is well known, the <HI>French</HI> did
not part with but with the u$mo&s;t Difficulty, and
with the greate&s;t Reluctance imaginable. It had
<PB N="42" REF="41">
been ea&s;y to have gratified the <HI>French</HI> King at
that time, without giving &s;o general a Di&s;ta&s;te,
and at lea&s;t without having it lie as a particular
Charge upon them. If the City of <HI>Li&s;le</HI> had been
left to the <HI>Dutch</HI> in&s;tead of <HI>Dunkirk,</HI> and as an
Equivalent, it can &s;carce be doubted but the
<HI>States-General</HI> would have been made full as ea&s;y
as at having <HI>Dunkirk</HI> put into the Hands of the
<HI>Engli&s;h;</HI> and no que&s;tion the <HI>French</HI> King would
have given &s;ome Millions to have made the
Exchange: So that if the De&s;ign had been to
have given back <HI>Dunkirk</HI> to the <HI>French</HI> undi&s;man|tled,
the Mini&s;try could have gratify'd the <HI>French</HI>
with leaving it in their Hands at fir&s;t, much bet|ter
and much more to their own Safety, than they
can re&s;tore it again after they have gotten it: Nor
is it rational to think that the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Govern|ment,
who &s;o &s;trenuou&s;ly and &s;o immovably in|&s;i&s;ted,
at the time of the Treaty, on the Condi|tion
of having <HI>Dunkirk</HI> delivered up to them as a
Pledge for the Security of the Performance of
the other part of the Treaty, &s;hould now deli|ver
it back to the <HI>French</HI> Undemoli&s;h'd. Can any
one believe that the Memory of its being parted
with to <HI>France</HI> formerly, and the Reproach, <HI>tho'
unju&s;tly too,</HI> which was ca&s;t on the Reputation of
the late Lord Chancellor <HI>Hyde</HI> for being in&s;tru|mental
in the Bargain and Sale of <HI>Dunkirk,</HI> is
not recent enough in the Memory of our Mini|&s;try
to move them to avoid &s;plitting their Cha|racters
on &s;uch a Rock? If the Mini&s;try had no
Regard to the Safety and Honour of their Coun|try
in the Treaty, why did they &s;teddily in&s;i&s;t
upon having <HI>Dunkirk</HI> put into their Hands? And
if they had &s;o much Concern for the Intere&s;t and
Honour of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> as to refu&s;e all Condi|tions
<PB N="43" REF="42">
of a Treaty without that important Point,
why &s;hould they be &s;u&s;pected of &s;o much Weak|ne&s;s,
as well as Unfaithfulne&s;s to their &s;aid Coun|try,
as to give it back again? The Charge does
not &s;eem to be &s;upported by Rea&s;on; be&s;ides, it
is very unju&s;t and unfair to &s;uppo&s;e &s;uch a thing
when the very Sugge&s;tion of it is &s;o unnatural and
improbable.</P>
<P>2. As to the Opinion of its being in the De|&s;ign
of the Mini&s;try not to Demoli&s;h it at all; it
does not &s;eem to have any Foundation in the
Rea&s;on and Nature of the Thing, unle&s;s the
<HI>French</HI> King &s;hould not punctually and honora|bly
perform the Conditions of his Treaty, ac|cording
to the true Intent and Meaning of the
Treaty; and in &s;uch ca&s;e, no true <HI>Britain,</HI> faith|ful
to the Intere&s;t of his Country, can give his
Con&s;ent to the Demoli&s;hing <HI>Dunkirk:</HI> In the
mean time, 'tis a marvellous thing that we &s;hould
have Men among us, who &s;hould de&s;ire to have
the Queen of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> dive&s;t her &s;elf of the
Power &s;he has now in her Hands to enforce the
Treaty, and to oblige the <HI>French</HI> to perform the
Conditions. To have the <HI>French</HI> King willing
that <HI>Dunkirk</HI> &s;hould be fir&s;t Demoli&s;hed, and un|ea&s;y
that he is not permitted to go about it;
this would be rational, and what might be ex|pected:
but, that the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> the <HI>Briti&s;h Nation,</HI>
People who pretend to be concern'd for the Ho|nour
and Intere&s;t of their Country; to have
the&s;e be unea&s;y, and in ha&s;te to have <HI>Dunkirk</HI>
Demoli&s;hed, this is really admirable, and the
Occa&s;ion of it unaccountable.</P>
<P>3 <HI>dly,</HI> As to keeping it in Concert between <HI>Great-Britain</HI>
and <HI>France,</HI> for private De&s;igns: When
tho&s;e private De&s;igns are rationally &s;ugge&s;ted,
<PB N="44" REF="43">
&s;ome Reply may be made; but at pre&s;ent it is &s;o
incongruous and weak a Sugge&s;tion, that it merits
no An&s;wer at all.</P>
<P>A few Ob&s;ervations then may &s;erve to &s;et us
right in this Matter.</P>
<P>1. There is no rea&s;on to doubt, but that
when the Conditions of the Treaty of Peace are
perform'd, our Commerce &s;ecured, the Peace of
this part of <HI>Europe</HI> E&s;tabli&s;hed, and the Dangers
that we may ju&s;tly apprehend from the War, yet
depending between the <HI>Emperor</HI> and the <HI>French</HI> King
at an End, <HI>Dunkirk</HI> will be Demoli&s;hed; I &s;ay, there
is no Cau&s;e to fear it, for two Rea&s;ons, (1.) Be|cau&s;e
there is no doubt but the <HI>French</HI> King will
in&s;i&s;t upon it, and be very ill &s;atisfied if it is
not done. (2.) Becau&s;e Her Maje&s;ty being a
Ju&s;t, a Righteous, and a Chri&s;tian Queen, and ha|ving
Capitulated with the <HI>French</HI> to &s;uffer it to
be done, it cannot without great Indecency be
&s;ugge&s;ted, that tho&s;e Capitulations &s;hall not be
performed. If no ju&s;t Rea&s;ons drawn from the
Non-performance of Articles on the other Side,
&s;hall occur to make it ju&s;t and rea&s;onable not to
do it.</P>
<P>2. If &s;uch rea&s;onable Ob&s;tructions &s;hould hap|pen,
as &s;hould make it nece&s;&s;ary to keep the
Pledge, as a farther Security, of which al&s;o the
Parliament may be Judges, it would be very un|accountable
to &s;ugge&s;t, e&s;pecially by a Subject of
<HI>Britain,</HI> that it &s;hould not be &s;afe in our OWN
<HI>Hands;</HI> and indeed, this makes the Complaint
appear &s;o wonderful among us, <HI>viz.</HI> That it &s;hould
not be &s;afe for Her Maje&s;ty to keep <HI>Dunkirk</HI> in
Her OWN <HI>Hands;</HI> and, it is to be fear'd, tho&s;e
that think &s;o, do not think it &s;afe for the Queen
<PB N="45" REF="44">
to keep the Crown in Her own Hands; they
would do well to &s;peak plain, and tell us.</P>
<P><HI>1&s;t.</HI> Would they have it Demoli&s;hed before the
Conditions, for which it is a Security, are per|form'd?</P>
<P>2 <HI>dly.</HI> Who&s;e Hand would they think it &s;afe to
have it kept by in the mean time, if not in our
own Hands; and why not in our Hands, to
whom the &s;aid Conditions are to be perform'd?</P>
<P>But let us come to the main Point, and &s;uppo&s;e
it were never to be Demoli&s;hed at all, and &s;o
advantagious an Article had been obtain'd, that
<HI>Great-Britain</HI> &s;hould have been Mi&s;tre&s;s of one of
the be&s;t Ports made by Art, and the &s;tronge&s;t
Fortre&s;&s;es in the World; Had this been our Lo&s;s
or our ine&s;timable Advantage? Sure the like Ar|gument
to this was never u&s;ed, in any Ca&s;e of this
Nature, in the Memory of Man, or beyond it;
that the mo&s;t impregnable Fortification of the <HI>Low-Countries,</HI>
the mo&s;t advantagious Port of the whole
We&s;tern part of the World, the Curb of <HI>France,</HI>
the Bridle of the <HI>Flemings,</HI> the Terror of the <HI>Hol|lander,</HI>
and that has been the Plague of <HI>Great-Bri|tain,</HI>
&s;hould be put into our OWN Hands, and
we &s;hould be afraid to keep it.</P>
<P>Were it po&s;&s;ible to bring the <HI>French</HI> King to
con&s;ent that the Queen &s;hould keep Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of
the Town of <HI>Dunkirk,</HI> with all its Fortifications.
What Mini&s;ter of State could An&s;wer it to his
Country, or his Honour, to refu&s;e or neglect &s;e|curing
&s;uch a Thing to the Nation? And what
<HI>Engli&s;hman,</HI> or what Subject, faithful to the Inte|re&s;t
of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> but would rejoyce to &s;ee &s;uch
an addition of Strength made to the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Empire?
But an unhappy Spirit now reigning among us, runs
<PB N="46" REF="45">
up Things to &s;uch a highth of Di&s;&s;ention, that we
are made afraid of our &s;elves; afraid that tho&s;e
who are Intru&s;ted by Heaven with the Crown it
&s;elf, &s;hould be Intru&s;ted by us with the keeping of
<HI>Dunkirk,</HI> nay, with the keeping it till we can be
&s;afe in Surrendering and Demoli&s;hing it: A little
Time will fully expo&s;e the Folly of this Notion,
and let us &s;ee not the Nece&s;&s;ity of keeping it a
while only, but the Infinite Glory and Advantage
it would bring to <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> if once more the
Important Town of <HI>Dunkirk</HI> could be united to
the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Empire.</P>
<P>One of the weak and ab&s;urd Objections again&s;t
it, and which it is wonderful wi&s;e Men are not
a&s;ham'd to mention, is the Charge of keeping
it; as if the Importance of the Place was not
infinitely greater than the Expence of maintaining
it can be; and this is &s;till more fooli&s;h, becau&s;e it
is well known the Cu&s;toms of the Harbour of
<HI>Dunkirk</HI> will always be &s;ufficient to pay the Gar|ri&s;on,
and all the Expence of the Fortifications,
and much more; but if it were not &s;o, the Argu|ment
is of no Force at all.</P>
<P>3 <HI>dly.</HI> That it will be a pretence for keeping up
a &s;tanding Force: This is equally ab&s;urd with the
former, becau&s;e the Garri&s;on of <HI>Dunkirk</HI> being li|mited
to a certain Number of Men, ju&s;t as many
as are &s;ufficient to its nece&s;&s;ary Defence, it will
always be nece&s;&s;ary to keep them there, &s;ince a
full Garri&s;on, &s;uch as in Ca&s;e of a Siege would be
needful, might not be needful to be always there,
the Sea being at our Command, and we always
ready to &s;upply the Place from <HI>England</HI> out of
the &s;tanding Forces which are allowed; or a
certain Number of tho&s;e E&s;tabli&s;hed Forces might
be always added to the u&s;ual Garri&s;on, which
<PB N="47" REF="46">
indeed would always make our E&s;tabli&s;hment le&s;s,
rather than more.</P>
<P>The pre&s;ent Mini&s;try have &s;hew'd &s;o little In|clination
to Govern by a &s;tanding Army, and, on
the contrary, have given &s;uch an undi&s;puted Te&s;|timony
to prove that they are Enemies to a &s;tand|ing
Army, that it is not without the greate&s;t
Inju&s;tice, that &s;uch a Thought of them can be
entertain'd, &s;eeing they have appointed the E&s;ta|bli&s;hment
of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> to be Two thou&s;and
Men le&s;s than was appointed after the Peace of
<HI>Ry&s;wick.</HI></P>
<P>I &s;ee no Argument of any Force remaining,
to urge the &s;peedy Demoli&s;hing of <HI>Dunkirk,</HI> or
the Demoli&s;hing it all, if it could be pre&s;erved in
our own Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; our dear bought Experience
might have admoni&s;hed us in &s;uch a Ca&s;e, &s;ince
we &s;o ha&s;tily di&s;mantled <HI>Tangier,</HI> which was an
infinite Detriment and Di&s;advantage to us, during
the la&s;t War, e&s;pecially till <HI>Gibraltar,</HI> by an un|expected
and unfore&s;een Ca&s;ualty, fell into our
Hands; and it is wonderful, our People who are
&s;o willing to have <HI>Dunkirk</HI> out of our Hands,
&s;hould not have the &s;ame Pa&s;&s;ion to di&s;charge us
of <HI>Gibraltar</HI> and <HI>Port-Mahon,</HI> the Arguments be|ing
much the &s;ame, as to Expence of keeping
and &s;tanding Forces; but we hope, in a &s;hort
while, we &s;hall &s;ee our own Intere&s;t more clearly;
and if ever a War &s;hould be renew'd in this part
of the World, and <HI>Dunkirk</HI> &s;hould be ours, we
&s;hould be pre&s;ently convinced of the Con&s;equence
of it.</P>
<P>In a word, the Ca&s;e is this: If we mu&s;t be
forced to Demoli&s;h <HI>Dunkirk,</HI> we mu&s;t do it be|cau&s;e
we are engaged to do it, after all Conditions
<PB N="48" REF="47">
of Peace and Commerce are performed and &s;e|cured;
but if it could be obtain'd to <HI>Great-Bri|tain,</HI>
to keep it as our own, it would be an inex|pre&s;&s;ible
Honour and Advantage to the whole
Kingdom: The Particulars of what Advantage
it would be, are re&s;erved for a larger De&s;crip|tion.</P>
