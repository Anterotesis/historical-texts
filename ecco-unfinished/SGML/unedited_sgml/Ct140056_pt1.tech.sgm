<OPENER>Lord Charles Rainsford to Colonel Harcourt.</OPENER>
<P>AH! my friend, may you never have
occa&s;ion to practi&s;e the philo&s;ophy you
preach! Believe me, that charming foun|dation
for patience and re&s;ignation would
vani&s;h at the approach of affliction; &startq;and,
like the ba&s;ele&s;s fabric of a vi&s;ion, leave
not a wreck behind.&endq; Tho&s;e common
precepts &s;uit not the greatne&s;s of my lo&s;s.
Re&s;ignation and a bleeding heart are in|compatible;
and he who is wounded
<PB N="2" REF="4">
with a dart like this, mu&s;t feel too much
to argue. No, my friend, at be&s;t your
medicine is but an opiate: it may, for a
time, lull me into in&s;en&s;ibility, blunt all
the finer feelings of the &s;oul, but never,
never &s;hall joy re&s;ume its abode in this
breaking heart, a heart which &s;hall ever
bear my Delia's image. I go, my friend;
this gay metropolis ill &s;uits my grief: I
fly to Bellmont.</P>
<Q><L>&startq;For, alas! where with her I have &s;tray'd,</L>
<L>I can wander with plea&s;ure alone.&endq;</L></Q>
<P>Plea&s;ure!&mdash;Ah, no; plea&s;ure and I,
like childi&s;h friend&s;hips, were too fond to
continue long in&s;eperable. Oh! I'll in|dulge
this luxury of grief!</P>
<Q><L>&startq;And to the Nightingale's complaining notes,</L>
<L>Tune my di&s;tre&s;&s;es and rehear&s;e my woes.&endq;</L></Q>
<P>The po&s;t has ju&s;t brought me your let|ter.
Cold, in&s;en&s;ible man! you never
loved: a heart &s;o callous could never admit
<PB N="3" REF="5">
the animating flame. And yet, from the
rectitude of your &s;entiments, from that
univer&s;al benevolence, one &s;hould be led
to imagine the refining pa&s;&s;ion had not al|ways
been a &s;tranger to your heart; that
heart &s;o feelingly awake to pity, &s;o ready
to relieve the wants of the afflicted. Oh,
come my friend, come to Bellmont, there
we'll enjoy</P>
<Q><L>&startq;The fea&s;t of Rea&s;on, and the flow of Soul.&endq;</L></Q>
<P>We'll talk of Delia,</P>
<Q><L>&startq;For there's mu&s;ic in the name;</L>
<L>That, &s;oftening me to infant tenderne&s;s,</L>
<L>Makes my heart &s;pring like the fir&s;t leaps of life.&endq;</L></Q>

<Q>&startq;In the Pre&s;s and will &s;peedily be publi&s;hed,
as a relief for di&s;tre&s;s'd Macaronies, A COL|LECTION
OF POEMS FOR THE USE OF
THE FAIR SEX, by Lord <HI>Charles Rains|ford.&endq;</HI>&endq;</Q>
<P>ON my word, thy la&s;t letter was &s;o en|tirely
poetical, it de&s;erves to be eternally re|corded
in the annals of gallantry, as a per|fect
model for the love-lorn throng.</P>
<P>Prithee Rainsford, whence did&s;t thou
borrow tho&s;e <HI>moving</HI> quotations? And is it
then in rural retirement you hope to con|quer
this unfortunate pa&s;&s;ion? But you are
right, my Lord: however un&s;ucce&s;sful
the attempt, you will <HI>there</HI> find fewer
witne&s;&s;es of your folly. Yet why &s;uffer
your hours to langui&s;h in the gloom of
anxiety? Why, with every grace of mind
<PB N="5" REF="7">
and per&s;on that can adorn and improve
&s;ociety, will you fly from man's be&s;t joys,
the joys of &s;ocial and convivial live; and,
to brood o'er one di&s;appointment, give up
all other plea&s;ures? Fie, my Lord, are
you not more incon&s;i&s;tent than the child
who, deprived of the cake it cried for,
refu&s;es all other &s;u&s;tenance?</P>
<P>I called la&s;t night on Lady Beverly.
She informs me the two Mi&s;s Montforts
&s;pend the winter in London, and make
her hou&s;e their home; and, as &s;he has
more room than her own family require,
and has ju&s;t purcha&s;ed a new carriage, &s;he
&s;hall be very glad to &s;ee them. &startq;Be&s;ides,&endq;
added &s;he, &startq;I have a great friend&s;hip for
poor Mrs. Montfort, which I intend to
demon&s;trate by receiving her daughters:
and a man of Colonel Harcourts &s;en&s;e
cannot be &s;o ignorant of the manage|ment
of a family, as not to know that
two young ladies are a great trouble and
expence, and require additional attend|ants,
and a more elegant table.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="8">
Sure, Rainsford, this woman is con|&s;tructed
upon a very &s;ingular plan. She
moves by clockwork: and yet who can
deny her an unlimited multiplicity of ideas,
&s;ince they are bounded but by the garret
and the kitchen, or the mo&s;t univer&s;al
knowledge, of the ri&s;e and fall of fa&s;hi|ons,
and of the hi&s;tory of her family?</P>
<P>My intimacy with Harry Montfort re|quires
that I &s;hould pay my re&s;pects to his
$i&s;ters. In the mean time, as &s;oon as I can
di&s;patch &s;ome nece&s;&s;ary bu&s;ine&s;s, I &s;hall fly
to Bellmont, and expect you will &s;acrifice
your rivulets and groves to friend&s;hip.
Return with me, my dear Rainsford; let
me per&s;uade you to revi&s;it the gay metro|polis;
and though we cannot aboli&s;h pain,
we will endeavour, in the modi&s;h circle,
$o blunt &s;en&s;ibility.</P>

<P>WELL, Fanny, notwith&s;tanding my
aunt Martha's unlucky omens, I am, thanks
to my kind &s;tars, &s;afe in Brook Street.
Would you believe it my friend? No ad|venture!
A hundred miles from home,
and no adventure! no knights errant!&mdash;Po&s;itively,
my good aunt, it is true.&mdash;In|deed,
all the <HI>he</HI> creatures I have &s;een, look
rather as if they had been confined in en|chanted
ca&s;tles, for the ladies amu&s;ement,
than like the de&s;cendents of our warlike
&s;ires; and, in&s;tead of &s;torming ca&s;tles for
our relief, they &s;eem, by their more than
female effeminacy, to throw them&s;elves
upon us for protection. Happily for them,
there now exi&s;t no enchanters, or, believe
me, the brave&s;t of our heroes would turn
pale at the &s;ight of a windmill.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="10">
Surely, Lucy, Gay had an in&s;ight into
futurity when he wrote the Fable of the
Monkey that had &s;een the world. The
modi&s;h world appears peopled by &s;uch a
race of animals.</P>
<P>This London is the &s;trange&s;t place!
Such rounds of folly, vi&s;iting and cards,
that <HI>Vive'la Bagatelle</HI> is the reigning motto,
and &s;eems banded about from Hyde-park
to White-chapel. And yet, my friend,
&s;o many &s;olemn faces, you would &s;wear
they were in expectation of a general con|flagration;
and I, the flaming comet, de&s;|tined
to fire the world.&mdash;Don't you think
I improve, Fanny?</P>
<P>A ticket for the ridotto.&mdash;Now for hair-dre&s;&s;ers,
milleners, and a long train of
etceteras. Lady Beverly (the drolle&s;t ori|ginal)
&s;ummons me to the toilet; I fly to
attend the important duties. O, you
would laugh to &s;ee your <HI>once</HI> gay friend</P>
<Q><L>&startq;Pre&s;ide o'er trifles with a &s;olem face.&endq;</L></Q>
<P><PB N="9" REF="11">
Though, upon &s;econd thoughts, why
need I dre&s;s? Surely there can be no oc|ca&s;ion;
&startq;for loveline&s;s,&endq; you know, my
dear, &startq;needs not the outward aid of orna|ment.&endq;
Turning therefore to my &s;i&s;ter,
I &s;aid, &startq;Lucy, child, go and dre&s;s, while
&startq;I obey my friend's commands.&endq;</P>
<P>Believe me, Fanny, that in a&s;king
&startq;What kind of woman is Lady Beverly,&endq;
you could not have put a que&s;tion more
difficult to be an&s;wered.</P>
<P>Lady Beverly delights in a numerous
retinue of &s;ervants, and in the elegance of
her table. She is a <HI>mighty good kind of
woman,</HI> and eats, drinks, and &s;leeps in re|gular
rotation; but for another pa&s;&s;ion, it
is not in Lady Beverly you mu&s;t &s;earch for
it. Mi&s;tre&s;s of a great fortune, which &s;he
knows not how to enjoy, her hours lan|gui&s;h
in in&s;ipidity. She beholds her friends
approach and departure with equal indif|ference.
She goes into public, becau&s;e
<PB N="10" REF="12">
&s;he ob&s;erves others do &s;o; and returns
home, becau&s;e &s;he is fatigued. Reque&s;t
charity, and hold out a dignified prece|dent,
and you may command her pur&s;e;
but to afford &s;uccour to di&s;tre&s;s from the
tender motives of humanity, is what &s;he
never knew, In fine, Lady Beverly, with
all that wealth that may attract flatterers,
or, by a right u&s;e, command e&s;teem, lives
unadmired, unbeloved; and will die, my
Fanny, unregretted; while none but her
&s;ervants can give te&s;timony that &s;uch a
woman ever exi&s;ted.</P>
<P>I fancy you are, ere this, thoroughly
tired of this Lady Beverly, &startq;this fair de|fect

<HEAD>LETTER IV.</HEAD>
<OPENER>From the &s;ame to the &s;ame.</OPENER>
<P>LOVE! Why, in the name of won|der,
Fanny, what romance was thy la&s;t
&s;tudy? Believe me, love is an antique
entombed with our grandmothers; and if
our modern pretty fellows ever mention it,
it is for want of other conver&s;ation; or,
as they talk of Cae&s;ar and Alexander,
merely to &s;hew their reading. However,
my dear friend, let me introduce my fa|vourite
to you.</P>
<P>Now do not imagine I am going to
trace out the the highly-fini&s;hed figure of
an Apollo, or the regular graces of an
Adonis. Harcourt's elegance is as much
&s;uperior to the dull, inanimate &s;trokes that
mark out beauty, as his wit is above that
to which we are accu&s;tomed to give the
name. In &s;hort, we mu&s;t compile a new
<PB N="12" REF="14">
dictionary, ere I can hope to give you the
lea&s;t idea of him. By way of attempting it,
try to figure to your&s;elf the God of wit
de&s;cending among us, and a&s;&s;uming the
form of Edmond Harcourt.&mdash;By this time
I pre&s;ume your &s;agacity has led you to
di&s;cover,</P>
<Q><L>&startq;Tis not a &s;et of features, or complexion,</L>
<L>The tincture of a &s;kin that I admire.&endq;</L></Q>
<P>To &s;ay truth, I have met with people
who tell me Edmond is a perfect <HI>memento
mori;</HI> but to him I can ju&s;tly apply what
Rollin &s;ays of Alcibiades: &startq;There is no
heart &s;o hard, or temper &s;o un|tractable,
as to hold out again&s;t the
charms and graces of his conver&s;ation
and intimacy.&endq; Nor does there exi&s;t
that being, who views his approach with|out
tran&s;port, or his departure without re|gret.</P>
<P>His per&s;on is tall, very thin, and his
face is remarkable for nothing but a pair
<PB N="13" REF="15">
of lively black eyes, which are under ex|cellent
di&s;cipline; as they can &s;upply the
place, even of that graceful flow of words
and elegance of expre&s;&s;ion, which none
be&s;ides command. He affects a &s;aucy neg|ligence
in his per&s;on and manners, for the
general run, that renders his attentions,
when he is di&s;po&s;ed to be&s;tow them, ab&s;o|lutely
irre&s;i&s;tible: and, if I have not yet
&s;ecured your e&s;teem for the witty, the ele|gant,
the engaging Edmond Harcourt,
dare no longer refu&s;e it to the <HI>Man of
Honour.</HI> Yes, my friend, that &startq;Sacred
Tie&endq; has ever bound him: that princi|ple,
however in the ea$s of others it may
&s;eem but a found, in his brea&s;t has proved
it&s;elf a reality, a reality as much &s;uperior
to that <HI>ignis fatuus,</HI> by which many are de|luded,
as is the &s;un to the glow$ worm.
Actuated by this, his gayeties have &s;till
been plea&s;ures; his munificence, di&s;creti|tion;
his courage, humanity. What needs
there more to complete my hero, but that
<Q><L>&startq;His generous friend&s;hip no cold medium knows;&endq;</L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="16">
And that, if in our forgivene&s;s of our
enemies, we could lo&s;e the &s;en&s;e of the
injuries we have received, Edmond Har|court
would be as happy as he is de|&s;erving.</P>
<P>I had a thou&s;and things to tell you, but
have time for no more at pre&s;ent. Adieu.</P>

<OPENER>Sir George A&s;hby to Captain Bevill.</OPENER>
<P>WELL &s;aid, Bevill, and &s;o thou
woud&s;t have thy friend George A&s;hby &s;ink
into a downright Benedick; and for the
&s;ake of po&s;terity too! On my word, a
mighty unan&s;werable argument for dome&s;|ticating
a gay young fellow.</P>
<P>No, no, Frederick, I will level moun|tains,
rai&s;e plantations, and even build
ho&s;pitals for po&s;terity; but with the old
man in the Spectator, I &s;hould be glad to
&s;ee this much talked of po&s;terity, do &s;ome|thing
for me.</P>
<P>Thy la&s;t letter, Frederick, &s;poke the
frigid, cold advi&s;er. And is Captain Bevill
then yet to learn how weak that rea&s;on is
which can but point out danger, not teach us
<PB N="16" REF="18">
to avoid it? Yes, my friend, I obey your
dictates, I rea&s;on much&mdash;but rea&s;on of
Emilia;</P>
<Q><L>&startq;And where <HI>&s;he</HI> is, all rea&s;on dies before her.&endq;</L></Q>
<P>I &s;ee Lady Harriet, I endeavour to re|kindle
my extingui&s;hed pa&s;&s;ion; but each
endeavour recoils upon my&s;elf, and tells
me it is impo&s;&s;ible. True, &s;he is beauti|ful;
but, my friend, when the Earl wi&s;h|ed
you to marry Lady Mary, did not your
eyes bear te&s;timony to her charms? And
did not you not declare, that meer beauty
might attract your &s;en&s;es, but could not
captivate your heart?&mdash;&mdash;No, Bevill, 'tis
the elegant, the in&s;inuating Emilia, who,
with &s;ewer per&s;onal graces, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es all that
&s;weet &s;implicity of thought, all that ten|der
&s;en&s;ibility of &s;oul, which would make
even ugline&s;s attractive; 'tis &s;he who has
won my heart.</P>
<P>That I once loved Lady Harriet, my
friend, how could it be otherwi&s;e? Young,
<PB N="17" REF="19">
unexperienced, undi&s;cerning, my heart
readily yielded to her charms; and, in
tho&s;e tender moments of delu&s;ion, I gave
that fatal paper, that frantic promi&s;e, that
rends my &s;oul.&mdash;What do I &s;ay? Even
<HI>without</HI> a promi&s;e, thy A&s;hby had been <HI>ju&s;t.</HI>
Yes, Frederick, this heart can mourn, it
can bleed in fulfilling its engagements; but
it knows not to betray un&s;u&s;pecting inno|cence.</P>
<P>Thanks to Lady Waters, (who is on a
vi&s;it to my mother) I am more frequently
<HI>t&ecirc;te &aacute; t&ecirc;te</HI> with Emilia.&mdash;You know my
god-mother&mdash;a rough diamond, that needs
but the workman's hand to render it of in|e&s;timable
value.&mdash;Nature, my friend,
may form the jewel, but it is education a|lone
can give the poli&s;h: and how in&s;uffici|ent

pale, dejected. Oh! Love! Thou &s;ource
of &s;orrow, what mi&s;ery do&s;t thou oc|ca&s;ion!
Say, my friend, is there a pang
which derives not its origin from that
&s;pring? He, too, has lo&s;t the partner of
his heart.</P>
<Q>&startq;Snatcht ere her prime, and in her bridal hour.&endq;</Q>
<P>He walked with the Mi&s;s Montforts, two
Northampton&s;hire beauties, who made
their fir&s;t appearance this winter. They
are &s;weet girls. The elde&s;t, tall, &s;pright|ly,
blooming, beautiful as an angel, and
happy too; for &s;he, my dear, glories in in|&s;en&s;ibility.</P>
<P>Lucy, the younge&s;t, elegantly formed;
a complexion fair as her &s;potle&s;s mind;
the mo&s;t delicate features imaginable; a
<PB N="24" REF="26">
countenance &s;trongly expre&s;&s;ive of the ut|mo&s;t
tenderne&s;s; and eyes in which you
read every &s;entiment of her heart.&mdash;Sweet
novice! too unpracti&s;ed to di&s;gui&s;e her
&s;ufferings. She loves Maria; the lovely
girl owns her attachment.</P>
<P>Harry Willmott, two years ago, &s;pent
the &s;ummer at Montfort-Hall. Two
young people, of exqui&s;ite &s;en&s;ibility, and
of unequalled merit, con&s;tantly together,
mu&s;t, as my &s;weet Lucy &s;ays, indulge a
friend&s;hip for each other. Ah, Maria,
how dangerous are the&s;e tender friend&s;hips!
She e&s;teemed him, &s;he loved him as her
brother. Though always fond of the
country, &s;he never thought it &s;o delightful
as then, uncon&s;cious it was her Henry's
pre&s;ence enlivened every &s;cene.</P>
<P>Colonel Willmott de&s;troyed the plea&s;ing
dream. He wrote to his &s;on, that, by
great intere&s;t, he was nominated a writer
from Bengall. The opportunity was not
<PB N="25" REF="27">
to be neglected; and the doating lover
mu&s;t leave the mi&s;tre&s;s of his heart; leave
her ignorant of his &s;entiments.</P>
<P>The &s;ervant who brought the letter
waited with a chai&s;e, and Harry Willmot
mu&s;t embark at Port&s;mouth on the mor|row.
What could he do? His Lucy's eyes
had oft betrayed the &s;ecret of her heart,
a &s;ecret of which &s;he only was uncon&s;cious,
and ignorant of his &s;entiments, that he
&s;hould, doubtle&s;s, find her married on his
return.</P>
<P>The thought was not to be borne; it de|termined
him. He flew to the garden,
and found his lovely Lucy bu&s;ied in &s;electing
the faire&s;t flowers to form a
no&s;egay for her tender friend. In artle&s;s
language he avowed the pure&s;t pa&s;&s;ion for
the amiable Lucy. To know &s;he loved,
to find a lover, and to lo&s;e him, were the
&s;ame. She has not &s;ince heard of him.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="28">
Surely, my dear, he mu&s;t have had op|portunities
for writing! O, the&s;e men are
&s;trangely negligent; and though they will
not allow us their equals in under&s;tanding,
willingly yield us the palm in conduct.</P>
<P>Adieu, Maria, think &s;ometimes of my
Lucy Montfort, think &s;ometimes of Sir
George A&s;hby, and if you &s;hould ever be
tempted to love, think of your friend,</P>

Prithee, Edmond, let me twine the

<P>What you tell me of her &s;i&s;ter may be

<P>The &s;weet Lucy Montfort, you &s;ay,

a heart always open to the unfortu|nate.</P>
<P>Ah, for this fair Helen, I would lay

<P>What &s;ay you, Edmond, to a trip to
Scotland? The delight of per&s;uading a

<P>ABSOLUTELY, George, you are

till, like a vapour, it eludes our

<P>I am, at pre&s;ent, engaged in the pretti|e&s;t

<P>Give me a girl, George, that has &s;ome
life, &s;ome animation: not one of your

$ll her plea&s;ures center in pomp and &s;plen|dor;

Charity, kindne&s;s, benevolence, are

My mother wondered what &s;o

<P>Mi&s;s Montfort ye&s;terday enquired after
you.</P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="49">
&startq;Colonel Harcourt,&endq; &s;aid &s;he, &startq;How is
your friend Lord Charles? Still immured
at Bellmont, and thinks, I dare &s;wear,
when out of the reach of temptation, to
make a merit of his con&s;tancy.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Surely, Mi&s;s Montfort will own his
Lord&s;hip's retreat was highly nece&s;&s;ary:
there is no &s;u&s;taining, unwounded, the
artillery of her eyes.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Poor Colonel! I am afraid the cau&s;e
will be but indifferently defended, when
the opponent de&s;cends, by compliment,
to cheat his adver&s;ary of her under&s;tand|ing.
But there can be no merit, Sir,
in unnece&s;&s;ary violence; nor can he
who &s;huns the combat, ever de&s;erve a
triumph.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;His friend, Mi&s;s Montfort, will be a
warning to him never to tru&s;t his happi|ne&s;s
to a woman. O! my Eliza! either
ble&s;s me with your &s;miles, or teach me
to de&s;pi&s;e them. If my unremitted a&s;&s;i|duities
<PB N="48" REF="50">
can never &s;often this &s;toical in|difference,
for mercy's &s;ake appear not
thus all lovely.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Upon my word, Colonel, a mo&s;t ex|cellent
&s;peech that:&mdash;and extempore
too!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Ungenerous girl, calmly to ridicule
the woes you cau&s;e! But know, madam,
this heart can break, but it will bur&s;t
your chain.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Right, Sir. This heroi&s;m is infinitely
becoming; and you will, doubtle&s;s, main|tain
it.&endq; (looking at her watch.) &startq;I
forgot, I appointed to meet Lord E&s;dale
in the Mall, and it is now two o'clock.
If Colonel Harcourt ever thinks it worth
his while to call in Brook-&s;treet, we &s;hall
be glad to &s;ee our friend.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Oh! my Eliza! You know your
power. The heart, once &s;tamped with
<PB N="49" REF="51">
your form, mu&s;t ever bear the lovely
image.&endq; (&s;natching her hand.) &startq;I can|not
leave you thus; &s;wear you forgive
me.&endq;</P>
<P>Lucy's entrance put an end to our con|ver&s;ation;
and I e&s;corted the ladies to the

<P>Lucy was &s;weetly inqui&s;itive about you.
She talked of you with a look of tender
concern. She pities you. &startq;Ah, Colonel
Harcourt,&endq; &s;aid &s;he, &startq;how dreadful to
be &s;eparated from what we love! But
why &s;tay at Bellmont, where every ob|ject
mu&s;t remind him of his Delia?
Surely this gay metropolis might di&s;i|pate
his melancholy.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;May I flatter my&s;elf my &s;weet friend

<P>&startq;No, Colonel, I wi&s;h not to era&s;e Mr.
Willmott's image from my heart: there

<P>Tell me, my Lord, cannot the amiable
Lucy &s;ucceed your Delia? I am but a bad

<P>Yes, Sir George, the conflict was noble,

my affection for Lucy Montfort is pure as
the angelic form, pure as the &s;potle&s;s mind
that rou&s;ed my &s;en&s;ibility, and a&s;&s;ured me
I had &s;till a heart. I imagine it may be
po&s;&s;ible to pa&s;s through life without a ten|der

not in man to love but once. The heart
once &s;oftened, readily admits future im|pre&s;&s;ions:
&s;en&s;ibility, once rou&s;ed, can
never after lie dormant. Lucy too is en|gaged:

<P>ON my life a mo&s;t enlivening &s;ociety

Egerton is here, who has been dying, in
rhyme, the&s;e twenty years, and is now
gayer than ever. Pity his looks contradict
his poetical a&s;&s;ertions; though, if I may
believe him, the ladies, fearing to lo&s;e &s;o
bright a &s;ubject of their charms, have,
through mere &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s, pre&s;erved the va|luable
life of this heroic Don Quixote.</P>
<P><PB N="57" REF="59">
We have al&s;o here the eloquent Lord
E&s;dale, a &s;econd Demo&s;thenes, who ha|rangues
on beauty with the utmo&s;t proprie|ty
and embelli&s;hes a head-dre&s;s with all
the flowers of rhetoric.</P>
<P>Then the inviting Lady Sarah&mdash;an old
maid, Harcourt&mdash;who gapes for a civil
&s;peech as does a fi&s;h out of water for air,
and is ready to eat up every young fellow,
who comes within five yards of her.</P>
<P>We have here, likewi&s;e, the lovely
Arabella, who thinks and talks of nothing
but her charms. She vows &s;he pities the
poor young men her cruelty drove to
de&s;pair.</P>
<P>&startq;But love, you know, charming Ara|bella,
on pity cannot live.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;True, my lord, it is too thin a diet.
But pray, &s;ince Mr. Patchwell, the law|yer,
told me la&s;t night murder is a

<P>&startq;O, Madam, love is the in&s;eparable

yours was made to wound.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Dear, my Lord, and do you really

<P>&startq;O, my dear Arabella, it is impo&s;&s;ible

more attractive, the amiable endowments

But why turn our arms again&s;t

her lovely image?</P>
<P>The Duke and Dutche&s;s &s;eem de&s;titute of

their having no character. Too idle to
think, too in&s;en&s;ible to feel for them&s;elves,
they drive with the torrent. Happily for
them, their a&s;&s;ociates, though ridiculous,
are innocent, and their Graces boa&s;t of
virtue: virtuous, Harcourt, by the mere
ab&s;ence of vice. Good God! And could&s;t
thou intend thy creatures for this negative
perfection? Reject with me, my friend,
the humiliating, the unworthy idea; let us,
by our conduct, a&s;&s;ert the &s;uperiority of

Con&s;cious &s;he merits happine&s;s, &s;he doubts
not of attaining it. Harcourt, I cannot
pity when &s;u&s;picion is over-reached, or art
outwitted; but that this charming confi|dence,
the natural re&s;ult of innocence and
under&s;tanding, &s;hould be deceived, wounds
me to the &s;oul.</P>
<P>Your Eliza, my friend, cannot be long

from her heart. Sweet girls! The&s;e affec|tionate

<P>&startq;START not!&endq;&mdash;Ah, Augu&s;tus, is
it po&s;&s;ible I &s;hould do otherwi&s;e than &s;tart,
at the complicated &s;cene of villainy your
la&s;t pre&s;ented to my imagination? Dia|bolical
invention! And yet, Augu&s;tus, &s;ee
the depravity of human rea&s;on: I adopt a
villainy my heart dete&s;ts. Already have I
&s;et the implement of cruelty at work.&mdash;
Surely the Devil pre&s;ented Mrs. Burton's
image to you, you drew her &s;o exactly.
The woman would per&s;uade me, too, &s;he
thinks it for my good Emilia &s;hould be re|moved,
that my marriage may be no
longer delayed.&mdash;The gentle Emilia has
this in&s;tant &s;ent to intreat my company in
her dre&s;&s;ing-room. Never before did I
obey her dear commands &s;o reluctantly,</P>
<Q><PB N="72" REF="74">
Sir <HI>George A&s;hby</HI> in Continuation.</Q>
<P>EMILIA met me with a flood of
tears.</P>
<P>&startq;Ah, Sir George,&endq; &s;aid &s;he, &startq;how
can I relate my &s;orrows to you, or how
hope the &s;on, &s;hould conde&s;cend to hear
the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of a wretched dependant
on his mother's bounty, when that mo|ther
di&s;dains to li&s;ten to a recital of her
angui&s;h, or her interce&s;&s;ions for forgive|ne&s;s,
though uncon&s;oious of a crime?&endq;</P>
<P>She &s;unk into a chair, unable to pro|ceed,
till my endeavours to &s;ooth her had,
in &s;ome mea&s;ure, &s;ucceeded.</P>
<P>&startq;I took the liberty, Sir George,&endq; con|tinued
&s;he, &startq;to reque&s;t the favour of
an interview, in hopes from the good|ne&s;s
you have ever &s;hewn me (though
<PB N="73" REF="75">
when Lady A&s;hby proves unkind, where
can I hope for friend&s;hip?) that you
would intercede for my forgivene&s;s, or
at lea&s;t learn the cau&s;e of my misfor|tune.&endq;</P>
<P>I gave her in&s;tant a&s;&s;urances of my con|cern
for her intere&s;t, left her, and went to
my mother's apartment.</P>
<P>Oh, Richmond, how &s;hall I de&s;cribe to
you the &s;ucce&s;s our deep-laid villainy met
with here? The rage of Lady A&s;hby was
as great as you could wi&s;h. She bade me
in&s;tantly tell Emilia to quit her hou&s;e. My
affected entreaties exa&s;perated her more,
and &s;he &s;ent the mo&s;t cruel me&s;&s;age by Mrs.
Burton. On my return to the dejected
Emilia, I endeavoured, (but in vain) to
calm her troubled &s;oul: She repeatedly
called upon her friend, her Henrietta
Winche&s;ter; wi&s;hed her kind protectre&s;s
at hand; talked of flying to her; but,
<PB N="74" REF="76">
ca&s;t off by Lady A&s;hby, who would re|ceive
her?</P>
<P>Every minute I was on the point of
owning my guilt, of throwing my&s;elf at
Lady A&s;hby's feet, and entreating her to
re&s;tore Emilia to her favour.&mdash;Are the&s;e,
thought I, the joys of that love Richmond
talks of, which can know no happine&s;s,
but in the wretchedne&s;s of its object? But
the thought that it was now too late to ob|tain
belief from Lady A&s;hby deterred me.
I told Emilia I would in a po&s;t chai&s;e con|vey
her to a farm about twenty miles di&s;|tant,
and that, in the mean time, nothing
on my part, and that of Mrs. Burton,
&s;hould be omitted to effect Lady A&s;hby's
reconciliation.&mdash;Poor, deluded girl! Ah,
Richmond! where is the &s;o-much boa&s;ted
merit of deceiving; and to whom belongs
the triumph, &s;ince the deceiver feels a
thou&s;and pangs for every one his wiles in|flict?</P>
<P><PB N="75" REF="77">
The chai&s;e I had ordered drove up to the
door. I put the trembling Emilia into it,
and conveyed her to a little retreat, who&s;e
peaceful &s;hades never before received &s;o fair
a vi&s;iter, or&mdash;&s;uch an accompli&s;hed vil|lain.</P>
<P>I have taken lodgings at a farm in the
neighbourhood&mdash;but take notice, Rich|mond,
never will I receive Emilia to my
arms but with her own con&s;ent. Talk no
more, therefore, of your potions, your
poi&s;onous draughts: you have already ad|mini&s;tered
one with which all happine&s;s fled
from the brea&s;t of my Emilia, and con&s;e|quently

<P>I Might perhaps li&s;ten to my poor Har|court;
but, as things are &s;ituated, upon
my word, Sir, it is impo&s;&s;ible. The&s;e

at plea&s;ure, I make &s;hipwreck of my peace.
&mdash;The&s;e men, Fanny, are never repul&s;|ed,
it is impo&s;&s;ible to affront them. Our
&s;miles a&s;&s;ure them they po&s;&s;e&s;s our hearts;
<PB N="77" REF="79">
our very frowns have a peculiar meaning;
and if, di&s;gu&s;ted at their &s;hocking appear|ance,
we venture to &s;hut our eyes, they
&s;wear it is but to deliver our&s;elves from
temptation.</P>
<P>Strange that Lucy has not yet heard from
Harry Willmott! Ah, Fanny, how mi&s;e|rable
the maid, who tru&s;ts in man for hap|pine&s;s!
Con&s;cious of their power to pain us,
they refine on torture, and with amaz|ing
indifference, con&s;ign us to the tor|ments
of &s;u&s;pence, and all the pangs of
ill-requited love.</P>
<P>Lord Charles Rainsford has been &s;ome
days in town, he &s;eems diligently a&s;&s;iduous
in &s;tudying my Lucy's wi&s;hes, and tran&s;|cendently
delighted when he can procure
her plea&s;ure. Would this amiable man
might &s;upply her Willmott's place!</P>
<P>By the way, Fanny, don't you think
his Delia's image readily era&s;ed? Ah, be|lieve
<PB N="78" REF="80">
them not. When they &s;wear eternal
love it is but a bait to tempt us to their
hook, and this their boa&s;ted con&s;tancy but
an <HI>ignis fatuus</HI> to lure us to our ruin.</P>
<P>A knock at the door.</P>
<P>&startq;If it is Colonel Harcourt, let him be
admitted.&endq;</P>
<P>He comes at a good time, Fanny, and
your friend is in a mo&s;t charming di&s;po&s;ition

<P>&startq;Good morrow, Colonel.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Writing Mi&s;s Montfort! I fear I inter|rupt
you. Happy they to whom the&s;e

lover.&mdash;Ah, my Eliza, is it not &s;o?
Or nature, charmed with the lovely ca&s;|ket,

you her mo&s;t perfect production.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="79" REF="81">
&startq;On my word, Colonel, the&s;e clear
days are prodigiou&s;ly advantageous to the

walk be agreeable to you, Sir? We were
ju&s;t going out.&mdash;Betty, let my &s;i&s;ter

<P>&startq;Oh, Mi&s;s Montfort, allow me a few
minutes. Can you re&s;olve to trifle with
a heart that adores you; to triumph in a
lover's &s;ufferings?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Still on the old &s;ubject, Harcourt? I
mu&s;t not hear you. I am wi&s;e enough to
take warning from a friend's experience,
and will &s;hun the fanta&s;tic tyrant. Can
<HI>you,</HI> who boa&s;t your&s;elf my friend, wi&s;h
me to re&s;ign an indifference which con|&s;titutes
my happine&s;s?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Suffer me, my Eliza, to convince you
that the happine&s;s you fancy you po&s;&s;e&s;s,
<PB N="80" REF="82">
can only be found in the enlivening tran&s;|ports
of mutual pa&s;&s;ion.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I fear, Harcourt, it were but a dange|rous
experiment, and I mu&s;t either way
be wor&s;ted.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Why, is it my Eliza's pride to re&s;i&s;t
the tender dictates of her heart?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Colonel Harcourt, when I meet with
a man hone&s;t, &s;en&s;ible, incapable of
fal&s;ehood, my heart &s;hall own its con|queror;
till then &s;uffer me to enjoy the
indifference you cannot condemn.&endq;</P>
<P>Why, Fanny, mu&s;t I be teazed about
a pa&s;&s;ion I re&s;olve never to experience?
The&s;e men, my dear, are the verie&s;t
tyrants in the world. More cruel than even
their own Caligula, they wi&s;h our whole &s;ex
had but one heart, that they might wound

<OPENER>Lady Harriet Somner to Mi&s;s Lennox.</OPENER>
<P>YOU are mi&s;taken, Maria, my A&s;hby
is &s;till the man of honour$ &s;till perfectly in|nocent,
nor can I even blame his incon|&s;tancy.&mdash;To
have been beloved by Sir
George A&s;hby is a glory I would not barter
to reign the unrivalled idol of kneeling mo|narchs,
and the plea&s;ure I experience from
that &s;weet conviction, is infinitely &s;uperior
to the adulation of the unmeaning crowd.</P>
<P>You are di&s;&s;atisfied with my la&s;t letter.
&startq;When I expected,&endq; (&s;ay you) &startq;that La|dy
Harriet would have imparted her &s;or|rows
to her friend, how unkind this a&s;|&s;umed
heroi&s;m!&endq; After a friend&s;hip be|gun
in infancy, and cemented by the en|dearing
tye of mutual confidence, can my
Maria need to be informed that her Harriet
&s;en&s;ibly feels afflictions, but knows not to
<PB N="83" REF="85">
complain?&mdash;That I &s;till love Sir
George A&s;hby, is true. Ah, my dear,
is it po&s;&s;ible to &s;ee him, and be in&s;en|&s;ible
of his charms; to feel his merit,
and cea&s;e to love him? But how vain the
boa&s;t of that affection, which does not in|&s;truct
us to prefer the beloved object to
our &s;elves! Could happine&s;s be pur|cha&s;ed
with one &s;igh from my A&s;hby, I
would reject the tempting bait.</P>
<P>My brother, ye&s;terday, introduced Lord
Frederick Beaumont, a young nobleman
ju&s;t returned from his travels, This agree|able
creature has ju&s;t wit enough to enter|tain,
and good humour enough to plea&s;e.
He dre&s;&s;es, compliments, and trifles to ad|miration,
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es an infinite fund of &s;mall
talk, and is the univer&s;al favourite of the
ladies.&mdash;But when may we expect my
brother's friend, this Marquis? &startq;Ah,
Harriet, Harriet, does not this impati|ence
betray the female?&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="84" REF="86">
Can I, my dear, be unanxious for the
arrival of a brother's earlie&s;t friend? His
e&s;teem declares him worthy, and his per|&s;onal
graces, if not exaggerated by the
partial prai&s;es of friend&s;hip, would charm
the colde&s;t heart. Maria, what if for once,
in my life, I turn match-maker, and give
thee to the Marquis? believe me, I feel
my&s;elf infinitely more con&s;equential from
my newly acquired office.</P>
<P>The amiable Lucy Montfort is unhap|py.
So young to ta&s;te misfortune! Ah,
Maria, what is this boa&s;ted &s;en&s;ibility?
Who could believe that the bittere&s;t &s;or|rows
flow from the &s;weete&s;t &s;pring, and
that tho&s;e tender &s;entiments which, from a
ca&s;ual &s;urvey, one would imagine granted
but to receive and confer felicity, &s;hould
but render us the more &s;u&s;ceptible of mi&s;e|ry?&mdash;The&s;e
Lords of the creation, my
friend, can make their love &s;ubvervient to
their pride, and their pa&s;&s;ions move at the
command of intere&s;t.&mdash;More variable than
the volatile butterfly.</P>

<L>Free and uncen&s;ured thro' the wilds of love.&endq;</L></Q>
<P>My Maria, Sir George A&s;hby, is chang|ed!
How true is it that men are &startq;con&s;tant
only in incon&s;tancy!&endq;</P>
<P>Eliza Montfort is univer&s;ally admired,
and Colonel Harcourt is much with her.
I am mi&s;taken if the&s;e two flints di&s;cover
not, by mutual colli&s;ion, their latent fire.</P>
<P>This agreeable man, was, a few years
ago, unfortunate in an affair of the heart.
His parents died, while he was too young
to feel his lo&s;s, and left their little Edmond
to an uncle's care. An unincumbered e&s;|tate,
near five hundred a year, defrayed
the expences of his education; and, when
he returned from making the tour of Eu|rope,
he found their family encrea&s;ed by
the company of a beautiful girl, the
daughter of an intimate friend. Edmond
<PB N="86" REF="88">
felt the force of her attractions, nor was
his Caroline unintere&s;ted in his pa&s;&s;ion?
They vowed to live but for each other,
and our friend's behaviour was too particular
to e&s;cape ob&s;ervation. His uncle di&s;cover|ed
his attachment, and ordered him, as he
valued his favour, to think no longer of
her; a&s;&s;ured him, he loved him as his &s;on,
and that if he married with his approbati|on,
he intended to make him his heir.
No intere&s;ted motives could move the ge|nerous
Harcourt; but our lovers were
obliged to be more circum&s;pect. Soon af|ter
this, his aunt died; and Edmond, by
his uncle's de&s;ire, went immediately after
the funeral to &s;ettle &s;ome affairs in London.
He went with more alacrity, convinced
that Caroline intended quitting her friend's
hou&s;e, as her &s;tay was now become highly
improper. His bu&s;ine&s;s detained him lon|ger
than he expected, and three months
were nearly elap&s;ed when he received a let|ter
from his uncle, requiring his immedi|ate
attendance at H&mdash;. Po&s;t hor&s;es
<PB N="87" REF="89">
were ordered, and our a&s;toni&s;hed friend
obeyed the hurrying &s;ummons.&mdash;His
wonder was greatly encrea&s;ed, when he
came within his uncle's e&s;tate. He was
not met as u&s;ual, by the chearful tenants;
and, when he pa&s;&s;ed a rural cottage, the
children pointed at the chai&s;e, while the
old people, with anxious care, avoided
his looks.&mdash;He &s;topped the po&s;tillion,
and enquired the rea&s;on of this concern;
but could obtain no an&s;wer.&mdash;When
he approached the hou&s;e, an air of fe&s;tivi|ty
and joy augmented his &s;urprize. He
di&s;covered his adored Caroline, who came
out to meet him. Tran&s;ported at the un|expected
plea&s;ure, he threw him&s;elf out
the chai&s;e, and would willingly have
caught her to his bo&s;om,&mdash;Think,
Maria, what this tender lover mu&s;t have
felt, when his uncle introduced an
aunt, in the per&s;on of his beloved mi&s;|tre&s;s!
&mdash;Surprize, indignation, and con|tempt,
entirely deprived him of the u&s;e
of &s;peech, and he &s;uffered him&s;elf to be
<PB N="88" REF="90">
conducted to the hou&s;e. This &s;tupid calm
&s;oon di&s;&s;ipated, and, with returning rea&s;on,
he beheld Caroline &s;unk even below re|proach.
He wi&s;hed them joy with real
compo&s;ure; and, to convince this faith|le&s;s
woman his heart mu&s;t ever act in con|cert
with his judgment, he determined to
&s;tay that night, and di&s;covered his con|tempt
by more than common vivacity.
He left H&mdash;the next morning: and
has, &s;ince that, fore&s;worn the &s;ex.</P>
<P>Surely, Maria, this man has cau&s;e; his
fair pro&s;pects of fortune bla&s;ted thus, and
by the woman he loved. What a topic
for tho&s;e who glory to detract from female

Gothic man&s;ion, the wonder but of &s;tupid
clowns, that can reign the toa&s;t of this
gay metropolis?</P>
<P>Indeed, Harcourt, thou ha&s;t no chance.
Even a cockade, &s;upported but by a poor
five hundred, will be ineffectual to &s;ubdue
the haughty Eliza. And yet, my dear,
this man is infinitely charming; nature
&s;eems to have amply atoned the cruelty of
fortune.</P>
<P>O, I forgot. Would you believe it? I
think of entering the pale of matrimo|ny;
<PB N="95" REF="97">
and the man&mdash;&s;uch a man, child!&mdash;
How kind this early notice! You &s;ee I de|&s;cend
from my altitude of power to warn
you country mi&s;&s;es. Prepare your batte|ries;
for, if your hearts are not impregna|ble,
this Adonis will be the ea&s;y victor.
Let me attempt to de&s;cribe him. Now
for &s;miling loves, and Cupid's whole ar|tillery.&mdash;Alas!
my friend, it will not
do; and I mu&s;t unwillingly quit the &s;ub|lime.
This redoubtable hero then is, in
plain Engli&s;h, tall, thin, &s;illy, and imper|tinent;
perpetually aiming at wit, and
withall heavier than his own lead mines.</P>
<P>I have ever con&s;idered &s;en&s;e as the native
of every &s;oil, a plant that wants but the
warm &s;un&s;hine of favour to unfold its open|ing
blo&s;&s;oms; but this booby, &s;on of a
fond father, has &s;taggered my opinion.
He po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es an immoderate fortune, and
has engaged Lady Beverly as his advocate.
Is it po&s;&s;ible to hold out again&s;t their joint
eloquence? Her Lady&s;hip declares that,
as it is cu&s;tomary to marry, &s;he thinks I
<PB N="96" REF="98">

to provide the wedding dinner, and
regulate the <HI>etiquette</HI> of the day. How
fortunate this man, Fanny, to have made
a &s;econd of the only woman in the world
who would not have out&s;hone him!&mdash;The&s;e
monied-men, I imagine, lo&s;e a
grain of &s;en&s;e for every additional guinea;
and &s;o, thanks to kind nature, we are near|ly
on a par, our intellects being perfectly
equivalent to their wealth.&mdash;This is a fruit|ful
theme, and numberle&s;s reflections crowd
to my pen, but they are &s;o obvious your
own mind will ea&s;ily &s;ugge&s;t them. One
would conclude from this irremediable
&s;tupidity, that the dro&s;s, unwilling to be
parted from its native ore, inhabits the
&s;oul of its po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or, and &startq;tho&s;e whom
God has joined together, let no man
put a&s;under.&endq;</P>
<P>Ble&s;s me! Matrimony too, and Colonel
Harcourt at the door! Ominous, upon my

the Colonel was not di&s;po&s;ed to invade my

in town could induce her to delay her jour|ney.
I entreat her not to let us prevent her

uncu&s;tomary for the mi&s;tre&s;s of a hou&s;e to

that there is no other road to happine&s;s,
but through the Temple of Virtue.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;My father, in the early part of life,
quitted a world incapable of amu&s;ing an
enlightened mind, or of &s;atisfying a feel|ing
heart. To an under&s;tanding naturally
refined, and improved by reading, the
world had nothing to offer but a con&s;tant
<PB N="110" REF="112">
&s;ucce&s;&s;ion of the &s;ame tire&s;ome ceremonies,
the &s;ame unentertaining plea&s;ures. He &s;aw
tho&s;e talents that were be&s;towed for the no|ble&s;t
ends, employed for the ba&s;e&s;t purpo&s;|es,

heroes, poets, and philo&s;ophers.&endq;</P>
<Q><L>&startq;Now gaily blunts on fops its fatal dart,</L>
<L>Nor claims the triumph of a letter'd heart.&endq;</L></Q>
<P>&startq;Di&s;gu&s;ted at high life, he quitted the
brilliant &s;cene without regret; and &s;ought
variety in &s;olitude. Happily for him,
Mrs. Raymond and her agreeable daugh|ter,
who lived about a mile di&s;tant, pre|vented
his perceiving that the di&s;content|ed
carry within them&s;elves the &s;ource of
their unea&s;ine&s;s.&mdash;Why, Mi&s;s Montfort,
do the under&s;tanding and the heart lie &s;o
di&s;tant, and the dictates of the one &s;o &s;el|dom
regulate the feelings of the other?
&mdash;My father's heart confe&s;&s;ed Mi&s;s Ray|mond's

once, than always to live in fear of it&endq;,
with the mo&s;t heroic valour lo&s;t his life,
in bravely defending his country. Him|&s;elf,
his lovely partner, and their prattling
offspring, had long &s;ub&s;i&s;ted on his pay.
This tender hu&s;band feared his death
would overwhelm the heart which poverty
could never wound. The thought of his
I&s;abella's pangs was the only tie that kept
him from the &s;kies, and her lovely image
quitted his faithful heart, but with the ex|piring
&s;igh.</P>

<P>He tried every method to drive her idea
from his mind; but, finding it as impo&s;&s;i|ble
as it was to refrain from vi&s;iting her, he
re&s;olved to make the tour of Europe. He
was two years in travelling, but not meet|ing
that &s;atisfaction he promi&s;ed him&s;elf,

him his command &s;hould be his daugh|ter's
law, and his will regulate her inclina|tion.
My father appeared perfectly con|tent,
and I had the &s;atisfaction to &s;ee a
glow of plea&s;ure animate that countenance
which had been &s;o long ob&s;cured by me|lancholy.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="118" REF="120">
&startq;Our hou&s;e was now the abode of har|mony,
peace and plea&s;ure. Mr. O&s;nay's
attentions were, if po&s;&s;ible, augmented;
and, eagerly &s;olicitous for what he termed
his happine&s;s, he pre&s;&s;ed my father to name
the day that was to complete it.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;My dear Mi&s;s Montfort, how happy
your I&s;abelia in tho&s;e halcyon days of inno|cence,
when every new occurrence brought
additional felicity, and hope gaily &s;miled
upon futurity!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;The mo&s;t unfortunate accident inter|rupted
this golden dream of bli&s;s. My fa|ther
frequented the gaming table; and
though his fortune had received many
&s;hocks, he &s;till flatte$ed him&s;elf the next
throw would rein&s;tate him in his former af|fluence.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;He had this day dined with a large
company; and his own &s;pirits were exhili|rated
by foreign aid. In the beginning of
<PB N="119" REF="121">
the evening, fortune &s;eemed to &s;mile on
his projects, and the dice were propitious.
Encouraged by this &s;ucce&s;s, he ventured
larger &s;ums, nor found the incon&s;tancy of
the fickle godde&s;s, till it was too late to re|tract.
Still, however, he hoped another
change, nor could believe him&s;elf deceiv|ed,
till he was convinced his wealth was va|ni&s;hed,
his lands mortgaged, and that he
had nothing more to bet.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;He returned home almo&s;t di&s;tracted,
confe&s;&s;ed his di&s;appointment, and wept for
his I&s;abella&mdash;I begged him to be comforted;
a&s;&s;ured him, the misfortune, if he regain|ed
his chearfulne&s;s was trifling, but if aug|mented
by his &s;orrows, mu&s;t for ever de|&s;troy
his daughter's peace; that it would
be Mr. O&s;nay's pride to protect his father,
and our happine&s;s would &s;uffer no interrup|tion.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Ah, my child, &s;aid he, there is the
&s;troke that wounds me. Your exalted
<PB N="120" REF="122">
mind cannot comprehend the meanne&s;s
another may practi&s;e. Mr. O&s;nay's family
will &s;corn to connect them&s;elves with the
daughter of a ruined game&s;ter; and my
I&s;abella may prove the innocent victim of
a father's folly.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;My dear Sir, you know not Mr. O&s;|nay,
or you could not harbour a &s;u&s;picion
of his honour. Noble, generous, di&s;in|tere&s;ted;
to him &s;orrow never mourned un
alleviated, nor want held the &s;upplicating
hand in vain. Can &s;uch a man change
with the &s;miles of fortune, or reject the
worth he loves?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;My father &s;hook his head, but unwil|ling
to de&s;troy the plea&s;ing delu&s;ion, &s;eem|ed
to coincide with my opinion, and we
parted for that night.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Mr. O&s;nay's behaviour, the next day,
confirmed my opinion of his honour; and
as he did not mention my father's misfor|tunes,
we were &s;ilent on that topic.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="121" REF="123">
&startq;He vi&s;ited for &s;ome days as u&s;ual, but
methought his affection &s;eemed le&s;s fer|vent,
his intreaties le&s;s importunate, and
his vi&s;its &s;horter than before. At la&s;t he
totally ab&s;ented him&s;elf for three days.
Imagine my anxiety! Yet &s;till confiding
in his genero&s;ity, I attributed his negli|gence
to &s;ome unfore&s;een accident. Every
knock at the door alarmed me, I expected
this faithle&s;s lover, and was repeatedly di&s;|appointed.&mdash;
Trembling for a lover's
&s;afety, and obliged to hide my concern,
le&s;t it &s;hould affect a father's peace, what a
&s;ituation was mine! I was at la&s;t happily
relea&s;ed from it by the following billet:&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;MY I&s;abella, how &s;evere tho&s;e arbi|trary
commands, which oblige me to
refrain from vi&s;iting the woman I adore;
to &s;igh unpitied, nor once inform her of
my &s;ufferings!&mdash;The Earl has heard
your father's ill &s;ucce&s;s, and expects his
&s;on to &s;acrifice to the trifling con&s;idera|tion
of &s;uperior fortune, the happine&s;s
<PB N="122" REF="124">
of his life: but the lady he has cho&s;en,
&s;hall never di&s;pute my I&s;abella's title to
my heart. I &s;hall be this evening at
Mrs. M&mdash;'s, may I flatter my&s;elf you
will meet me there? Come, my love,
oblige with your pre&s;ence the man who
knows not to be ungrateful. Allow him
once more to breathe the &s;incere&s;t vows
at your feet, and to a&s;&s;ure you that he
is unalterably yours.&endq;</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>&startq;OSNAY.&endq;</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</DIV1>
<DIV1>
<P>&startq;This billet re&s;tored &s;erenity to my
agitated bo&s;om. I had not courage to
&s;hew it to my father, le&s;t he &s;hould prevent
our meeting in the evening. I had recour&s;e
to artifice; and by pretending bu&s;ine&s;s
with Mrs. M&mdash;, for the fir&s;t time in my
life, practi&s;ed di&s;gui&s;e.&endq;</P>
<P>I found Mr. O&s;nay had been there long
before me. He received me with tran&s;|port;
&s;wore that no change of circum|&s;tance
<PB N="123" REF="125">
&s;hould dimini&s;h his affection, nor
even a father's commands oblige him to
de&s;ert his I&s;abella. He propo&s;ed a private
marriage; but finding me aver&s;e to it,
dropped the de&s;ign. In &s;hort, my dear
Mi&s;s Montfort, imagine all the tender
things a heart in love could dictate, and
you may conceive Mr. O&s;nay's profe&s;&s;ions.
He would not &s;uffer me to depart, till
he had obtained my promi&s;e to meet him
there on the day following.</P>
<P>&startq;From my example, let all young
women avoid the fir&s;t fal&s;e &s;tep, nor think,
that prudence once &s;ilenced will ever re|&s;ume
her admonitions.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;New to di&s;gui&s;e, I took &s;uch pains
to deceive my father, he ea&s;ily penetrated
my over-acted precautions, and a&s;ked if I
had &s;een Mr. O&s;nay. I &s;corned an actual
fal&s;ity, acknowledged I had ju&s;t parted
from him, and put his letter in my father's
hands.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="124" REF="126">
&startq;My I&s;abella, &s;aid he, let us not &s;hew
by the meanne&s;s of our conduct that we
merit the misfortunes we &s;u&s;tain. Is it not
better to &s;uffer by a father's ra&s;hne&s;s; than
by your own imprudence? Scorn to be
the wife of a man, who fears to own you
publickly, and who, only &s;olicitous for
him&s;elf, will &s;acrifice your happine&s;s to his
own convenience.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Indeed, Sir, you wrong Mr. O&s;nay.
I am convinced his love for me is more
fervent than ever; but the Earl, unbia&s;&s;ed
by pa&s;&s;ion, has cho&s;en a lady of &s;uperior
fortune, and in&s;i&s;ts upon his &s;on's compli|ance.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;And can my I&s;abella connect her&s;elf
with a family that de&s;pi&s;e her? I am con|vinced
her more unprejudiced thoughts will
di&s;dain the degrading &s;u&s;picion. She will
remember,&endq; that the &startq;Love of a woman
of &s;en&s;e and virtue, does honour to a
monarch,&endq; and &s;corn to accept Mr. O&s;|nay's
<PB N="125" REF="127">
hand, un&s;anctified by parental ap|probation.
But if honour pleads in vain,
I&s;abella be not deaf to the calls of intere&s;t.
Mr. O&s;nay is entirely dependant on his fa|ther,
and marrying contrary to his expre&s;s
commands, he can expect but a bare &s;ub|&s;i&s;tence
from his bounty; and it were far
better, my I&s;abella,</P>
<Q>&startq;Not do the deed, than weep it done.&endq;</Q>
<P>&startq;Happy, Mi&s;s Montfort, had I thought
with my father; but this pa&s;&s;ion &s;eemed
to have deba&s;ed every &s;entiment of my
&s;oul. Mr. O&s;nay a&s;&s;ured me that after we
were married the Earl would be readily in|duced
to forgive; and by a &s;hort time ab|&s;enting
my&s;elf from Mrs. M&mdash;'s I ima|gined
I had &s;ufficiently &s;acrificed to honour.
I re&s;olved to keep my appointments from
my father's knowledge, and &s;ince I inform|ed
Mr. O&s;nay of my &s;ecrecy, his letters
were more frequent, his intreaties for a
private marriage more urgent. Ah, Ma|dam,
<PB N="126" REF="128">
in my &s;erious moments, I abhorred
my di&s;&s;imulation, but ten thou&s;and pleas
tended to &s;ilence the reproaches of con&s;ci|ence;
and, by marrying Mr. O&s;nay, I
hoped to &s;upport my father in his former
affluence.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;This idea, which could have induced
me to ru&s;h on mi&s;ery with tran&s;port, was
of infinite force, when it tended to &s;ancti|fy
the &s;oft inclinations of the heart. I
agreed to go with him to the altar, upon
his promi&s;ing that I &s;hould live with my
father till happier times ju&s;tified his claim.
This agreement &s;eemed to reconcile my af|fection
for Mr. O&s;nay, with my duty to a
parent, and with the mo&s;t a&s;toni&s;hing un|concern,
I prepared for the important day.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I went early in the morning to Mrs.
M&mdash;'s, where I met Mr. O&s;nay, who
had already prepared a clergyman. Un|fortunately
Mrs. M&mdash;was obliged to
attend one of her be&s;t cu&s;tomers, who had
<PB N="127" REF="129">
ju&s;t &s;ent for her. She refu&s;ed to go, but I
in&s;i&s;ted upon her not hazarding the lo&s;s of
the lady's favour for my &s;ake. We had,
therefore, no other witne&s;s than a friend
of Mr. O&s;nay's, who gave him, what he
politely termed, an invaluable trea&s;ure.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;The ceremony was ju&s;t completed,
when we were &s;urprized by a violent noi&s;e
at the door. Mr. O&s;nay begged me not
to be alarmed, &s;ince it could be no other
than &s;ome vi&s;itors to Mrs. M&mdash;. But,
my dear Mi&s;s Montfort, judge of my
emotion, when my father, pale, frantic,
di&s;ordered, ru&s;hed into the room!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I had ju&s;t life enough to hear him de|clare
I was no longer his daughter, to hear
this offended parent &s;olemnly renounce
me, and &s;unk &s;en&s;ele&s;s on the floor.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;When I regained my rea&s;on, I found
my&s;elf on a couch, and Mr. O&s;nay kneel|ing
by my &s;ide. I enquired for my father,
<PB N="128" REF="130">
but was told he left the room &s;oon after I
fainted away. I ordered a chair, and in|&s;$&s;ted
that Mr. O&s;nay &s;hould keep his pro|mi&s;e
inviolate. He complied more readily
than I could have expected, and I &s;et out
for that peaceful haven I &s;o lately quitted,
but found the doors barred again&s;t me.
The &s;ervants told me, with tears in their
eyes, their ma&s;ter ordered them, on pain
of his eternal di&s;plea&s;ure, to refu&s;e me ad|mittance;
but a&s;&s;ured me that, could they
be of &s;ervice to me, they &s;hould con&s;ider
the lo&s;s of their place as trifling. Doubt|ful,
uncertain what to do, I he&s;itated, when
Mr. O&s;nay came up to the chair.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;My I&s;abella, &s;aid he, had you then
rather &s;u&s;tain a father's rage, than tru&s;t the
hu&s;band who adores you? Your return|ing,
contrary to his po&s;itive injunctions,
will but the more exa&s;perate him. Suffer
me, my love, to conduct you to your own
hou&s;e. Time will, doubtle&s;s, &s;often a fa|ther's
heart, and di&s;po&s;e it to receive his
daughter.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="129" REF="131">
&startq;My father's anger appeared to me
unrea&s;onable. I had married a man infi|nitely
my &s;uperior; and, though without
the Earl's approbation, yet I doubted not,
but through his partiality for a much loved
&s;on, he might be induced to approve his
choice.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Mr. O&s;nay conducted me to a gen|teel
ready furni&s;hed lodging, and endea|voured,
with the utmo&s;t tenderne&s;s, to
di&s;&s;ipate my chagrin. Ah, Mi&s;s Mont|fort,
too giddy to reflect, too in&s;en&s;ible to
feel for another, I ea&s;ily forgot a parent's
&s;ufferings: and if, in Mr. O&s;nay's ab&s;ence,
an unea&s;y thought obtruded, I di&s;pelled it
by recollecting the rectitude of my mo|tives,
and willing at all events to enjoy
the &s;weets of &s;elf-e&s;teem, condemned my
father's pride, and the too rigid principles
of honour, to which he calmly &s;acrificed
the peaceful joys of dome&s;tic happine&s;s.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="130" REF="132">
&startq;At my hu&s;band's de&s;ire I cultivated
no acquaintance, nor was I vi&s;ited by any
one. His company, ever new, and ever
agreeable, rendered all other in&s;ipid; nor
had I an idea of any plea&s;ure &s;uperior to
the charms of his conver&s;ation. Indeed,
Mi&s;s Montfort, it is impo&s;&s;ible to paint my
felicity; I &s;hould but &s;hock you with the
ill-drawn likene&s;s. The plea&s;ing dream
&s;till pre&s;ents it&s;elf to my imagination, ar|rayed
in all the &s;potle&s;s purity of perfect
innocence. Ah, Madam, &s;uffer me to
draw a veil over futurity, nor awaken the
&s;orrows of a bleeding heart.&mdash;But your
de&s;ire &s;hall be complied with. Can you,
Madam, &s;till honour with your e&s;teem, the
woman who has forfeited her own, nor
has another claim to the ble&s;&s;ing &s;he re|que&s;ts;
but that &s;he is unfortunate, and
that it is Mi&s;s Montfort's glory to &s;uccour
the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, and by <HI>her</HI> regard fully over|pay
the cruelty of an ill-judging world?&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="131" REF="133">
&startq;Mr. O&s;nay's love &s;eemed unabated;
and had my father's con&s;ent &s;anctified my
happine&s;s, it had anticipated the joys of
heaven&mdash;Ah, Madam, how &s;weet the
flattering deception!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;The Earl and his family came to
town for the winter, and Mr. O&s;nay was
con&s;equently le&s;s with me than formerly:
yet he appeared to mourn our frequent &s;e|paration,
and &s;hared in the anxiety his ab|&s;ence
occa&s;ioned me.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I pa&s;&s;ed &s;ome weeks, &s;till &s;atisfied with
my hu&s;band, yet I thought his vi&s;its to the
earl much longer, and his too &s;edulous at|tention
incon&s;i&s;tent with what he owed his
wife.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;He was obliged to accompany his fa|mily
in an expedition for a few days, but
was ab&s;ent longer than he propo&s;ed. In
time his excur&s;ions became &s;o frequent$,
that I ventured gently to remon&s;trate. He
<PB N="132" REF="134">
was enraged, &s;wore he would not rein his
plea&s;ures to procure the happine&s;s of a
peevi&s;h, ungrateful beauty, nor maintain a
con&s;tancy returned but with reproach.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;In vain I endeavoured to pacify him:
this hu&s;band, &s;o much beloved, &s;o gentle,
&s;o engaging, was deaf to my entreaties:
and, notwith&s;tanding my efforts to detain
him, quitted the hou&s;e, declaring he would
never &s;ee me more.&mdash;I blamed my&s;elf
for irritating a temper unu&s;ed to re&s;traint,
but con&s;idered his anger meerly temporary,
and doubted not but that in a &s;hort time I
&s;hould &s;ee a repentant hu&s;band at my feet.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Some time, however, pa&s;&s;ed, and I
heard nothing of him. I began, indeed,
to be alarmed, and &s;ent my maid to the
Earl's to a&s;k if Mr. O&s;nay was in town. I
waited her return with the mo&s;t anxious
impatience. She brought word, that the
hou&s;e was in the utmo&s;t confu&s;ion; and
when &s;he enquired whether Mr. O&s;nay was
<PB N="133" REF="135">
in town, the &s;ervants laughed at the que&s;|tion.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;What could I think of this account? I
knew my hu&s;band's temper was violent,
but I thought him incapable of re&s;enting
an injury he no longer felt, and was cer|tain
my &s;ubmi&s;&s;ions, even &s;uppo&s;ing I of|fended,
had amply attoned the fault.
That he &s;hould have purpo&s;ely picked a
quarrel, meerly as an excu&s;e to ab&s;ent him|&s;elf
from me, was what my pride would
not &s;uffer me to believe, how then could
he be in London, and yet avoid his I&s;abel|la?
To relea&s;e my&s;elf from the&s;e morti|fying
reflections, I called for the news|paper.
Ah, Mi&s;s Montfort, think what I
&s;uffered when the fir&s;t paragraph I read
confirmed Mr. O&s;nay's infidelity, and in|formed
the public,&endq; &startq;Ye&s;terday was mar|ried,
at St. James's church, the Honour|able
Mr. O&s;nay, &s;econd &s;on to the Earl
of&mdash;, to Lady Mary Fitzgerald.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="134" REF="136">
&startq;I could read no further, the paper
dropped from my trembling hand, and I
&s;unk lifele&s;s in Betty's arms. As &s;oon as I
recovered, I &s;ent her once more to the
Earl's, and in&s;i&s;ted on her not returning
till &s;he had &s;een Mr. O&s;nay.&mdash;May-you,
Madam, never experience, even in idea,
the pangs I then endured. I knew my&s;elf
his wife, and re&s;olved no longer to di&s;gui&s;e
it, but affert my prior claim.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Betty returned. She had not been
long at the Earl's before a carriage &s;topped
at the door, and Mr. O&s;nay handed out
his bride.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;This faithful girl took care to place
her&s;elf where they were inevitably obliged
to pa&s;s. Mr. O&s;nay &s;tarted at the fight of
her, dropped Lady Mary's hand, and,
conducting her to a room, immediately
returned to Betty, and reprimanded her
for daring to intrude and ob&s;erve his con|duct.
She repre&s;ented my &s;ituation, and
<PB N="135" REF="137">
with artle&s;s eloquence painted my love and
&s;ufferings. He appeared affected with the
melancholy recital, and putting &s;ome gold
into her hand,&endq; &startq;Tell my I&s;abella,&endq; &s;aid
he, &startq;&s;he has &s;till a lover;&endq; and hurried
from her.</P>
<P>&startq;The &s;ervants confirmed the truth of
his marriage; and yet, &s;till confiding in
this dear perfidious, I could not credit the
account. My heart bore te&s;timony to his
innocence, while my deluded under&s;tand|ing
realized impo&s;&s;ibilities, and confirmed
the &s;weet illu&s;ion. Ah, Madam, this
cruel de&s;troyer of my happine&s;s, envious
even of the little I po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, by the fol|lowing
billet confirmed his fal&s;ehood, and
reduced me to the painful nece&s;&s;ity of tear-his
faithful image from my heart, and with
it each chearful pro&s;pect of felicity.&endq;</P>
