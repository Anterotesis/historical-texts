<HEAD>AN ENQUIRY, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>ABOUT ten years ago, the late lord Henry earl of Litchfield &s;hewed me a collection of manu&s;cript poems which he had ju&s;t brought from Bri&s;tol. He &s;aid they were &s;uppo&s;ed to have been written by Thomas Rowley, a prie&s;t of the fifteenth century, and that they had lately been di&s;|covered in the pari&s;h-che&s;t of Redcliffe church near that city. He did me the honour to a&s;k my opinion of their authencity. On reading a few of them, I expre&s;&s;ed my &s;u&s;|picions that they were mo&s;t probably &s;puri|ous. His lord&s;hip, who&s;e excellent ta&s;te and penetration I will here acknowledge even in &s;pite of my own hypothe&s;is, replied, that he was &s;urpri&s;ed at my &s;ceptici&s;m.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="3">I had not afterwards any convenient op|portunity of examining at lei&s;ure his lord|&s;hip's manu&s;cript, which I believe contained all the poems &s;ince publi&s;hed under the name of Rowley, elegantly tran&s;cribed. They are &s;till pre&s;erved in the library at Ditchley, ac|companied with a plau&s;ible and ingenious letter in defence of their originality, from my learned friend the late Pre&s;ident of Saint John's college Oxford, who was not the fir&s;t doctor in divinity de&s;tined to be a dupe to this egregious impo&s;ture.</P>
<P>The next year, my Brother, having been on a we&s;tern tour, &s;ent me &s;ome fragments of the&s;e poems, which he had accidentally pro|cured from Mr. George Catcott, a re&s;pectable pewterer of Bri&s;tol. About the &s;ame time, Mr. Barrett, a &s;killful &s;urgeon of that place, and an intelligent topographer, obligingly tran&s;mitted a &s;mall parchment containing the ACCOUNTE OF WILLIAM CANYNGES FEAST, &s;aid to be one of the genuine manu|&s;cripts of the poetry found in Redcliffe church: and from doctor Harrington of Bath, I received a paper of anecdotes con|cerning the manner in which this extraordi|nary trea&s;ure was fir&s;t brought to light. Soon afterwards, Mr. Catcott offered me the whole collection for &s;eventy pounds. But I had
<PB N="3" REF="4">
&s;een and heard enough, and did not li&s;ten to a propo&s;al, which on his own idea was not unrea&s;onable.</P>
<P>It may be a&s;ked, why I did not immedi|ately vi&s;it the fountain-head of this wonder|ful di&s;covery? It may &s;eem matter of &s;ur|pri&s;e, that the venerable Gothic vaulting of the antient muniment-room in Redcliffe church, and the ma&s;&s;y monumental che&s;t which pre&s;erved the&s;e ine&s;timable remains, had no charms to draw me to Bri&s;tol, in the united character of critic and antiquary! That I was inexorable to the many pre&s;&s;ing invitations of Mr. George Catcott! That I took no pains, to examine original manu|&s;cripts of &s;uch antient Engli&s;h poetry as had not yet been &s;een, before they were unluckily mi&s;laid, or irrecoverably lo&s;t! That I had no curio&s;ity to in&s;pect the vellom-rolls, both purple and yellow, the catalogue of Can|nynge's cabinet of medals, and the mona&s;tic antiquities of Bri&s;tol, all authenticated by &s;pecimens of the mo&s;t ob&s;olete &s;pelling, and marked with the mellow ve&s;tiges of evane&s;cent ink, in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the com|municative Mr. Barrett! An anonymous and angry critic, unexpectedly &s;oftens his tone, and allows, that I was once within &s;ixteen
<PB N="4" REF="5">
miles of Bri&s;tol <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">REMARKS UPON THE EIGHTH SECTION OF WARTON'S HISTORY OF ENGLISH POETRY, p. 6.</NOTE>. If not an indirect accu|&s;ation, I congratulate my&s;elf on this very candid conce&s;&s;ion in my favour, from a wri|ter &s;o little inclined to give quarter. <HI>E&s;t quiddam prodire tenus.</HI> But I will own much more, and what perhaps I ought in prudence to &s;uppre&s;s. I have, in various years &s;ince the revival of Rowley, not only advanced within &s;ixteen miles of Bri&s;tol, but at lea&s;t four or five times have actually arrived at that city, and have been even &s;ixteen miles beyond it. Yet I made no enquiries about Rowley or his poems. The truth is, the in|ternal proofs had always appeared to me &s;o convincing again&s;t the probability of the ex|i&s;tence of that pretended antient poet, as to &s;uper&s;ede the expediency of collecting facts, and of attending to any external arguments.</P>
<P>But if it had been ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, I found it almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible, to obtain a com|plete copy of the poems: and therefore, on the &s;canty &s;tock of materials which I have mentioned, con&s;i&s;ting of only one &s;uppo&s;ed original, and of a few imperfect extracts, ha&s;tily taken, and incorrectly written, I ven|tured to open my critici&s;m on the bard of Bri&s;tol, in the &s;econd volume of my Hi&s;tory
<PB N="5" REF="6">
of Engli&s;h Poetry. A &s;crutiny on the &s;pot would perhaps have prevented &s;ome inaccura|cies and mutilations with which I have there exhibited a few of the pa&s;&s;ages. But by ne|glecting to take this important mea&s;ure, I have unfortunately fallen into other mi&s;takes and mi&s;repre&s;entations of no &s;mall con&s;e|quence. Had I patiently reconnoitred the ground in per&s;on, I &s;hould have avoided the di&s;grace of many heavier imputations. For I have been &s;o carele&s;s as to a&s;&s;ert, that the poems were found in an iron che&s;t, which in reality is an wooden one. I have confounded Saint Ewin's church at Bri&s;tol with the cathedral. I have mi&s;named the yellow for the purple roll. I have given Rowley's poetry to Cannynge, and Cannynge's to Rowley. I have &s;uppo&s;ed a youth to be &s;eventeen who was little more than fifteen. I have trans|ferred a worthy benefactor's beque&s;t of an annual dinner, from a deed of gift to a will. With other unpardonable and unwar|rantable hallucinations, of equal weight in determining the merits of this enquiry; and which remind us of the unexpected retort of Curl the book&s;eller, who being &s;tigmati&s;ed by Pope for having been ignominiou&s;ly to&s;&s;ed in a blanket, &s;eriou&s;ly declared he was not to&s;&s;ed in a blanket but in a rug.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="7">In the year 1777, a complete edition of the poems attributed to Thomas Rowley, ex|hibiting entire and correct copies of tho&s;e pieces which I had before only &s;een in de|tached parts, and comprehending others of which I had never before heard, was publi&s;h|ed under the care of an able critic. But this publication, a te&s;t to which now a full appeal might be made, in&s;tead of &s;taggering, only &s;erved to &s;trengthen, my early apprehen&s;ions of a forgery: and by multiplying evidences in &s;upport of my &s;u&s;picions, furni&s;hed me with tho&s;e additional arguments, which I was now forced to throw together in the appendix to my &s;econd volume abovementioned. Not long after, I had the &s;atisfaction to &s;ee the &s;ame &s;ide of the que&s;tion adopted and defend|ed by the editor of the poems, in Ob&s;erva|tions on their language, which appeared to me &s;o deci&s;ive, as to preclude all future at|tempts to prove the&s;e pieces an original pro|duction of the fifteenth century.</P>
<P>But of literary contention there is no end. The Bri&s;tol-che&s;t has become the box of Pandora to the critical world. This contro|ver&s;y has been lately revived, in the mo&s;t for|midable &s;hape, by Mr. Jacob Bryant, and the reverend the Dean of Exeter, who contend that Rowley's poems are genuine. As both
<PB N="7" REF="8">
the&s;e writers have conde&s;cended to controvert &s;ome of my arguments, and as what I have hitherto advanced only forms an incidental part of a larger and a more general work, I have thought it my duty to re&s;ume this &s;ub|ject, to examine it with a greater degree of particularity, to extend and illu&s;trate the principles I before had e&s;tabli&s;hed, and to con&s;ider, if not to confute, the chief objec|tions. To have been &s;ilent or even indifferent on this occa&s;ion, would have betrayed a want of re&s;pect to the character of my two very learned and powerful opponents, or of proof in vindication of my original opinion. I would not incur the cen&s;ure either of petulance or pu&s;illanimity.</P>
<P>But even under the&s;e circum&s;tances, a di&s;pute about an unknown prie&s;t, who could compo&s;e poli&s;hed Engli&s;h ver&s;es in the fif|teenth century, and a blue-coat boy of Bri&s;|tol newly converted into an attorney's clerk, who could imitate the language of Chaucer and Lydgate, may perhaps appear too trifling to admit any further di&s;cu&s;&s;ion. In&s;ignificant as it may &s;eem, the determination of the&s;e que&s;tions affects the great lines of the hi&s;tory of poetry, and even of general literature. If it &s;hould at la&s;t be decided, that the&s;e poems were really written &s;o early as the reign of
<PB N="8" REF="9">
king Edward the fourth, the entire &s;y&s;tem that has hitherto been framed concerning the progre&s;&s;ion of poetical compo&s;ition, and every theory that has been e&s;tabli&s;hed on the gra|dual improvements of ta&s;te, &s;tyle, and lan|guage, will be &s;haken and di&s;arranged.</P>
<P>My readers will ob&s;erve, that in the cour&s;e of this enquiry, I have not only &s;uppo&s;ed the poems to be &s;purious, but to have been forged by Thomas Chatterton, the youth by whom they were fir&s;t di&s;covered and circu|lated. They will al&s;o be plea&s;ed at the &s;ame time to remember, that my adver&s;aries have drawn an unfair conclu&s;ion from the rever&s;e of the&s;e two &s;uppo&s;itions, that is, the anti|quity of the poems, and the incompetence of Chatterton. From the&s;e two points, im|properly blended and involved, Mr. Bryant and doctor Milles are perpetually &s;tarting a dilemma, that becau&s;e the poems could not have been written by Chatterton, therefore they mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be the compo&s;ition of Rowley.</P>
<P>I &s;hall di&s;tribute my arguments under the following heads. I. STYLE, COMPOSITION, AND SENTIMENT. II. METRE. III. AN|CIENT LANGUAGE. IV. HISTORICAL ALLUSIONS. V. BATTLE OF HASTINGS, and ELLA a TRAGEDY. VI. COMPARISON OF
<PB N="9" REF="10">
CHATTERTON'S POEMS WITH THE POEMS ATTRIBUTED TO ROWLEY. VII. MIS|CELLANEOUS OBSERVATIONS. VIII. CHA|RACTER AND CIRCUMSTANCES OF CHAT|TERTON.</P>
<P N="1">I. STYLE, COMPOSITION, AND SENTI|MENT. I find it nece&s;&s;ary to treat the&s;e principles indi&s;tinctly, as they are almo&s;t per|petually intermixed. And I &s;hall con&s;ider STYLE in its mo&s;t exten&s;ive &s;ignification, not only as including general &s;tructure, but ver&s;ification.</P>
<P>The&s;e poems exhibit, both in the connec|tion of words and &s;entences, a facility of combination, a quickne&s;s of tran&s;ition, a ra|pidity of apo&s;trophe, a frequent variation of form and phra&s;e, and a firmne&s;s of contex|ture, which mu&s;t have been the re&s;ult of a long e&s;tabli&s;hment of the arts and habits of writing. The ver&s;ification is equally vigorous and harmonious, and is formed on a general elegance and &s;tability of expre&s;&s;ion. It is remarkable, that whole &s;tanzas &s;parkle with that brilliancy, which did not appear in our poetry till towards the middle of the pre&s;ent century. The lines have all the tricks and trappings, all the &s;ophi&s;tications of poe|tical &s;tyle, belonging to tho&s;e models which
<PB N="10" REF="11">
were popular when Chatterton began to write ver&s;es.</P>
<P>Our old Engli&s;h poets are minute and particular. They do not deal in ab&s;traction and general exhibition, the effects of affecta|tion and a re&s;tle&s;s pur&s;uit of novelty. They dwell on realities. Even in the cour&s;e of narration or de&s;cription, where poets of the fourteenth or fifteenth centuries would have u&s;ed the literal expre&s;&s;ion, and repre&s;ented the &s;ubject by the mention of natural cir|cum&s;tances, the writer of the&s;e pieces adopts ideal terms and artificial modes of telling a fact, and too frequently falls into meta|phor, metaphy&s;ical imagery, and incidental per&s;onification.</P>
<P>Thus in the BATTLE of HASTINGS, where the intoxication of Harold's army on the eve of the engagement is de&s;cribed, the poet &s;ays,

<P>And in another de&s;cription of night, where an old poet in de&s;cribing moonlight, might perhaps have &s;aid that the Fairies now began their revels, our author's imagination goes much farther. He u&s;es the agency of a &s;y&s;tem of ideal creatures, as a vehicle for his general di&s;po&s;ition to ab&s;tracted poetry.</P>

<P>But the appearance of the&s;e images is not only tran&s;ient and incidental, as ari&s;ing out of the cour&s;e or tenour of a narrative or a &s;peech. Our author's propen&s;ity to per&s;onifi|cation is &s;ometimes indulged to a far greater extent. And here it is no le&s;s exceptionable. Not to advert at pre&s;ent to the decorations of expre&s;&s;ion, his HOPE, FREEDOM, and BAT|TAYLE, are delineated on too large a &s;cale for the &s;implicity of a remote period. The terrible groupe of Mi&s;eries and Misfor|tunes which Sackville in the MIRROUR OF MAGISTRATES has &s;tationed at the portal of hell, and the imbodied pa&s;&s;ions, virtues, and vices, of Spen&s;er's FAIRY QUEEN, a poem profe&s;&s;edly allegorical, have not that amplitude of proportion, di&s;tinctne&s;s of figure, &s;election of picture&s;que attributes, di&s;crimination, activity, and life, which con&s;titute the per&s;onal creations of Rowley. But Rowley preceded Sackville and Spen&s;er by a century. I mu&s;t give the portrait of FREEDOM, with her attendants. It makes a chorus in the tragedy of GODDWYN.</P>

<P>Yet on this very &s;u&s;picious ode, unhappily one of the mo&s;t &s;hining pa&s;&s;ages in all the poems, doctor Milles thus expatiates.
<Q>&startq;This Ode, or Chorus, is undoubtedly one of the mo&s;t &s;ublime compo&s;itions of Rowley's pen. &mdash; It &s;carcely contains a redundant word, or fails in a deficient expre&s;&s;ion; nor can its powerful imagery be conveyed in more conci&s;e or emphatical language. Freedom never appeared in a more original dre&s;s, than in her &s;ummons to war, in her wild attire, her undaunted &s;pirit, her enduring fortitude: and the effectual man|ner in which &s;he avenges her&s;elf of her enemy. The idea of Power is conveyed in &endq;the mo&s;t lofty images, &amp;c <NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Milles's ROWLEY, p. 298.</NOTE>.</Q>
This hy|perbole of panegyric perhaps proves too much. The learned pre&s;ident of the &s;ociety of antiquaries could not have produced more preci&s;e or &s;atisfactory proofs, that this cele|brated ode was not written three hundred years ago. It is Chatterton's misfortune to be convicted of forgery, not only by him&s;elf, but by his friends. His preten&s;ions to anti|antiquity
<PB N="17" REF="18">
are alike endangered by the excel|lence of his own poetry, and the prai&s;es of his commentators.</P>
<P>But let it be granted, that this is as perfect a model of allegoric delineation as any which has yet appeared in Engli&s;h poetry. The wonder is di&s;&s;olved, by re|recurring to the &s;uperiority of Rowley's genius. But &s;uperiority of genius, in the in|fancy of compo&s;ition, never yet produced a perfect model. A great genius, at &s;uch a period, in the boldne&s;s of native conception, will &s;trike out &s;ublimities and beauties never before &s;een. But the&s;e will be vague, extra|vagant, and undige&s;ted. The truth is, &s;uch a delineation as this before us, is not the work of genius but of art. It is the tardy product of the accumulated practice, expe|rience, and invention, of previous writers, who have &s;ucce&s;&s;ively been toiling for the u&s;e of po&s;terity, and have &s;upplied materials for future amplification and refinement. Poetry, like other &s;ciences, has its gradual acce&s;&s;ions and advancements. The united labour of pa&s;t ages contributes to its maturity. The di&s;coveries of Newton in natural philo&s;ophy, are the bright &s;uper&s;tructure of a foundation laid by a long &s;eries of celebrated predece&s;&s;ors. Mr. Bryant has ob&s;erved, in vindication of
<PB N="18" REF="19">
the po&s;&s;ibility that &s;uch poetry might have been written in the fifteenth century, that in every age there will be one per&s;on more emi|nent than the re&s;t. But this eminence will be circum&s;cribed or determined by adventi|tious and external circum&s;tances. It will bear down many ob&s;tacles, but it will be impeded by others. Invention is not confined to any age. But it will be differently exerted at different eras. It will not always have the &s;ame appearance. The Dean of Exeter in|forms us, that the objection to the excellence of Rowley's poetry
<Q>&startq;amounts only to this, that the fifteenth century has not pro|duced, and therefore could not produce, &endq;&s;o great a genius as Rowley <NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Milles's ROWLEY, p, 380.</NOTE>.</Q>
Let us allow that it did produce Rowley. But how comes it pa&s;s, that this great genius &s;hould have <HI>preci&s;ely</HI> copied the &s;tyle of the eigh|teenth century? Rowley might have formed a &s;tyle: but it would not have been the &s;ame as that now exi&s;ting. Genius is, in its nature, ab&s;olute, independent, and univer&s;al. But we &s;hould remember, that genius is connected with compo&s;ition. It will acquire a determi|nate character and &s;pecies. It will be in|fluenced
<PB N="19" REF="20">
by the condition of &s;ociety. It will a&s;&s;ume accidental and arbitrary forms. It will be &s;ubject to new and peculiar modifications.</P>
<P>Let us look back on the manner of writing practiced by our old poets. A &s;light compari&s;on will contribute to demon&s;trate Rowley's conformity with the modern.</P>
<P>Of old Engli&s;h poetry, one of the &s;triking characteri&s;tics is a continued tenour of di&s;parity, not &s;o much in the &s;tyle as in the &s;entiment. But the bad predominates. In this &s;ort of reading, we are but rarely reliev|ed from di&s;gu&s;t, or rouzed from indifference. We are &s;uddenly charmed with a beautiful thought in the mid&s;t of a heap of rubbi&s;h. Like Addi&s;on's traveller in the de&s;ert who finds an unexpected fountain, if in the bar|ren extent of a thou&s;and lines we di&s;cover a &s;olitary &s;imilie,
<Q>We ble&s;s our &s;tars, and think it luxury!</Q>
In the unpoli&s;hed ages, the mu&s;e was too awkwardly or too weakly courted to grant many favours to her lovers. In Gower, Chaucer, and Lydgate, elegant de&s;criptions, ornamental images, and melodious couplets, bear no proportion to pages of languor or mediocrity, to prolix pro&s;aic details in rhyme, unintere&s;ting and tedious. But the
<PB N="20" REF="21">
poems before us are uniformly &s;upported. They are throughout poetical and animated. They have, to &s;peak in general terms, no imbecillities either of thought or diction.</P>
<P>But to have been dull would not have &s;uited Chatterton's purpo&s;e, nor indeed was it con&s;i&s;tent with his genius. His aim was to dazzle and &s;urpri&s;e, by producing &s;uch high-wrought pieces of antient poetry as never before exi&s;ted. But to &s;ecure our cre|dulity, he &s;hould have plea&s;ed us le&s;s. He has &s;hewn too much genius, and too little &s;kill. <HI>Fallit te incautum pietas tua.</HI> Over|acting his part, and unable or unwilling to repre&s;s his abilities, he awakened our &s;u&s;|picions, and expo&s;ed his want of ad|dre&s;s in attempting to deceive. He &s;acri|ficed his veracity to an imprudent ambi|tion. In&s;tead of wondering at his con|trivance, we find he had none. A mediocrity of poetical talents would have &s;ucceeded much better in this impo&s;ture. He was too good a poet to conduct and execute &s;uch a forgery. He conceived, that his old poetry would be &s;ufficiently marked by old words and old &s;pelling. But he took no caution about thoughts and imagery, the &s;entiment and the &s;ub&s;tance. He had forgot, or never knew, or was not inclined to believe, that the garb of
<PB N="21" REF="22">
antiquity would but ill become the elegance of Pope, or the &s;pirit of Dryden. So ju&s;t is the ob&s;ervation of doctor Milles, when com|paring the ideas of Rowley and of Chaucer.
<Q>&startq;The nice&s;t ob&s;erver will &s;carcely di&s;cover a feature of re&s;emblance between the two &endq;poets <NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Milles's ROWLEY, p. 168.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>To pur&s;ue this compari&s;on yet farther. Our antient Engli&s;h bards abound in unnatu|ral conceptions, &s;trange imaginations, capri|cious extravagancies, and even the mo&s;t ridi|culous incon&s;i&s;tencies. But Rowley's poems pre&s;ent us with no incongruous combina|tions, no mixture of manners, in&s;titutions, u&s;ages, and characters. They have no violent or gro&s;s improprieties. In our old poets, Ovid and &s;aint Au&s;tin are &s;ometimes cited in the &s;ame line. Our old poets are perpetually confounding Gothic and cla&s;&s;ical cu&s;toms, knight-errantry and antient hi&s;tory, &s;cripture and romance, religion and chivalry. They make no di&s;tinction between &s;acred or pro|fane per&s;onages, between &s;aints and heroes, the warriors of the Iliad and of the Round Table, conjurers and logicians. Helen and the holy virgin are often compared for beauty, for prowe&s;s Sir Tri&s;tram and Jo&s;hua,
<PB N="22" REF="23">
and for wi&s;dom Merlin and Ari&s;totle. When a &s;eries of illu&s;trious lovers is enumerated, Samp&s;on and Dalila, David and Bath&s;heba, and Solomon with all his concubines, are arranged in company with Dido and Eneas, Medea and Ja&s;on, and Hercules and Deianira. In Gower's CONFESSIO AMANTIS, Uly&s;&s;es is &s;uppo&s;ed to have learned rhetoric of Cicero. In Lydgate's metrical LYFE OF OUR LADY, there are two long chapters,
<Q>&startq;Howe Jo&s;eph went to &s;eeke a mydwyfe, and &endq;howe our Lady receyved the mydwyves <NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">CH. xxxvii.xli.</NOTE>.</Q>
The &s;ame poet, a &s;cholar and an eccle&s;ia&s;tic, and till our late di&s;coveries, one of the fir&s;t poetical luminaries of the fifteenth century, makes Priam found a chantry in the capital church of Troy for Hector's &s;oul. Such was then the condition of writers and of readers, that Lydgate, in another poem has &s;eriou&s;ly ver&s;ified the rubrics of the mi&s;&s;al, which he applies to the god Cupid, declaring that he frequently meditated with great delight and edification on the holy legend of tho&s;e con|&s;tant martyrs, who were not afraid to &s;uffer a lingering death for the faith of that omnipo|tent deity. Do we find any of the&s;e weakne&s;&s;es, the&s;e palpable ab&s;urdities, in Rowley?</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="24">I have been &s;hewing that the&s;e poems, in &s;tyle, compo&s;ition, and &s;entiment, are not genuine, from their di&s;&s;imilitude to the antients, and their re&s;emblance of the moderns.

<P><PB N="31" REF="32">Before I clo&s;e this head, I mu&s;t ob&s;erve, that in extenuation of the objection ari&s;ing from the &s;moothne&s;s and elegance of Rowley, it is pretended that his native a&s;perities have &s;ometimes been &s;oftened and moderni&s;ed, and perhaps the defects of his manu&s;cripts inter|polated, by the officious hand of Chatterton. If this be true, where is the value or curio&s;i|ty of this boa&s;ted di&s;covery of antient Engli&s;h poetry? If a modern corrector has been at work, he has apparently been &s;o very bu&s;y, as to leave but little or none of the original.

His file has worn what it poli&s;hed. The &s;tory of old Cutler's only pair of &s;tockings, I am afraid, will be here inverted: they were originally of &s;ilk, but by being often mended with wor&s;ted, at la&s;t became entirely a pair of wor&s;ted &s;tockings. In the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, we will &s;uppo&s;e, we have a pair of good plain &s;tockings, originally wor&s;ted, which by being carefully darned with &s;ilk, are ab&s;olutely converted into a very decent pair of &s;ilk &s;tockings. If a portrait by Hans Holbein was to be retouched, or rather re|painted, by Reynolds, it would undoubtedly be made a much finer picture. But it would not be a picture by Hans Holbein. If, how|ever, the poetry before us &s;hould have been only corrected or interpolated by parts, I be|lieve there will be no difficulty in drawing the line of di&s;tinction between the re&s;pective property of Rowley and Chatterton. For &s;uch corrections and interpolations will ap|pear to con&s;i&s;t not only in words or hemi&s;|tics, but in a &s;uite of &s;tanzas, in pa&s;&s;ages of con&s;iderable length, and &s;uch as have been the favourites of the public, and have been di&s;tingui&s;hed for their poetical beauties. In a word, the few flat and in&s;ipid pa&s;&s;ages that remain in their original &s;tate, and are the indi&s;putable relics of the Redcliffe-che&s;t,

will ea&s;ily be con&s;igned to Rowley. Thus have we been blindly lavi&s;hing our admira|tion, and wa&s;ting voluminous illu&s;trations and laboured commentaries, on an antient bard of the eighteenth and not of the fifteenth century.</P>
<P N="2">II. METRE. It is not my de&s;ign to enter into a minute and technical examination of the mea&s;ures of the&s;e poems. A few general ob&s;ervations will be &s;ufficient.</P>
<P>The &s;tanza of old Engli&s;h poetry is mo&s;t commonly formed of lines of equal feet, and con&s;tantly pre&s;erves an uniform recurrence of the &s;ame &s;y&s;tematic alternation of rhyme. The SONGE TO ELLA is compo&s;ed in that devious and irregular mea&s;ure, which has been called the Pindaric. What &s;hall we think of a Pindaric ode in the reign of Ed|ward the fourth? It is well known, that this novelty was re&s;erved for the capricious ambi|tion of Cowley's mu&s;e. The writers of the fifteenth century were not &s;o fond of &s;oaring. They had neither &s;kill nor &s;trength for &s;uch towering flights. Our learned commentator, however, always abounding in a fertility of re&s;ource, immediately removes this difficulty, by con&s;idering the fire of Rowley's genius, impetuous in its career, impatient of me|chanical
<PB N="34" REF="35">
re&s;traint, and indulging its enthu&s;i|a&s;tic excur&s;ions in the freedom of unconfined numbers, and an unfettered pro&s;ody. He even proceeds &s;o far, in &s;olving this problem, as to in&s;inuate that Rowley might have &s;een Pindar.
<Q>&startq;That he had never &s;een or heard of the works of Pindar, his objectors can|&endq;not take upon them to prove <NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Milles's ROWLEY, p. 381.</NOTE>.</Q>
Pindar was one of the Greek cla&s;&s;ics that emerged late, at the re&s;toration of literature. He might have been known, although this does not appear, to the few Engli&s;h &s;cholars who now travelled into Italy: but certainly not to a provincial prie&s;t, educated in an ob&s;cure convent at Kein&s;ham in Somer&s;et&s;hire, and confined to his pa&s;toral duties within the narrow circle of Bri&s;tol. If the name of Pindar was at this time known in England, I &s;u&s;pect it was &s;carcely known whether he was a Greek poet or a Greek philo&s;opher, whether he wrote Greek odes or Greek ho|milies. Is he mentioned or cited by any of Rowley's cotemporaries? So is Pythagoras and Hermes Tri&s;megi&s;tus by Chaucer. The fir&s;t Latin ver&s;ion of Pindar was by John Lonicer, printed at Ba&s;il in 1528. Melan|cthon's tran&s;lation could not, I think, have
<PB N="35" REF="36">
been &s;o early. But Rowley was above Latin ver&s;ions of Greek, the refuge of a modern &s;choolboy. He was a reader of the Greek cla&s;&s;ics in their original, where he &s;aw their genuine excellencies. He was not only ac|quainted with Pindar, but, as we are peremp|torily a&s;&s;ured by the Dean of Exeter, with Homer, with Theocritus and Mo&s;chus <NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Milles's ROWLEY, p. 204.</NOTE>. If Rowley was acquainted with Pindar, he has borrowed nothing from the Theban bard, but the licentious exuberance of his lyrics.</P>
<P>The &s;tanza of the BATTLE of HASTINGS, of the TOURNAMENT, and of the Tragedies of ELLA and GOODDWYN, con&s;i&s;ts of ten lines. It is con&s;tructed of two quatrains rhyming alternately, and the&s;e are clo&s;ed with an Alexandrine. The long &s;tanza, or OT|TAVA RIMA, of Chaucer, never exceeds eight lines. Lydgate's is commonly confined to &s;even, and is the &s;ame that is called by Ga&s;coigne, a critic and poet of the decline of the &s;ixteenth century, RITHME ROYAL. But neither Chaucer nor Lydgate clo&s;e with the Alexandrine. Spen&s;er, with the addition of the Alexandrine, and &s;ome difference in the alternation of the rhymes, is the fir&s;t that extended this &s;tanza to nine lines. At
<PB N="36" REF="37">
length Prior, who lived more than two cen|turies after Rowley, in his Ode on the Queen, augmented Spen&s;er's &s;tanza with a tenth line, pre&s;erving his Alexandrine. This la&s;t, of which examples have been multiplied, was our poet's model. But not only the&s;e im|provements, if &s;uch they are, of the old OTTAVA RIMA, originally u&s;ed by Boccace, exclude the claim of antiquity from Rowley, but the unvaried and habitual exactne&s;s of the modulation of his final Alexandrine. Out of three or four hundred Alexandrines, hardly ten will be found that have not the pau&s;e after the third foot, &s;o indi&s;pen&s;ably e&s;&s;ential to the legitimate march and ju&s;t effect of an Alexandrine ver&s;e, and which is among the &s;triking melodies of Dryden. As thus, in the BATTLE OF HASTINGS.</P>

exceeded Spen&s;er, and equalled Dryden, in the mu&s;ic of ver&s;ification.</P>
<P>I am per&s;uaded, a greater variety of metre will not be found in any modern and more voluminous mi&s;cellany. From the &s;ublime irregularity of the Pindaric, and the &s;tately &s;olemnity of the RITHME ROYAL, our our author &s;ometimes de&s;cends to &s;port in lighter &s;trains. The de&s;ultory genius of Row|ley di&s;dained the dull identity, not only of a beaten but of a common track.</P>
<P>In the TRAGEDY OF ELLA, we have an ode, of which this is one of the &s;tanzas.</P>

<P><PB N="38" REF="39">The old Chaucerian word <HI>Cheri&s;auncey</HI>, in Chatterton's &s;tanza, never danced &s;o gaily be|fore. But it is not &s;o much to the movement, as to the double rhymes, that I here object.</P>
<P>There are I confe&s;s &s;ome double rhymes in Chaucer's ROMANT OF THE ROSE, but they are accidental, and they were &s;ugge&s;ted by corre&s;pondent French words and couplets in the French original. In our pre&s;ent in&s;tance, the double rhyme is con&s;titutive of a peculiar conformation of &s;tanza, of which it is one of the e&s;&s;ential properties. An ode was to be written with a regular and impo&s;ed return of this duplication. To &s;ay nothing in the mean time, that Chatterton took, perhaps imperceptibly, the two words here employed for double rhymes, from the ballad I have cited. The double rhyme is now adapted to the comic and familiar &s;tyle: and the unexpected con&s;onancy often gives an air of burle&s;que. Not one example occurs in Chaucer's bur|le&s;que poem of SIR THOPAS. Nor was it &s;carcely ever u&s;ed under any circum&s;tances by the elder poets, except in tran&s;lation.</P>
<P>Another metrical objection to be made to the authenticity of the&s;e poems, is the truth of accent, or legitimacy of cadence, which uniformly marks the termination of the lines. Our author never offends the ear by the u&s;e
<PB N="39" REF="40">
of words at the end of his ver&s;es, which would produce an improper &s;tre&s;s on final &s;yllables. This is a common and character|i&s;tical fault of the ver&s;ification of the old poets. But the writer of the&s;e pieces had been evidently trained to another texture and tone of ver&s;e. The &s;udden and abundant importation of Latin and exotic words into our language, by Chaucer and his immediate &s;ucce&s;&s;ors or followers, filled our &s;tyle with polly&s;yllabic terms. The&s;e &s;ometimes of cour&s;e found a place at the end of a line. There was however &s;ome degree of affectation in the ca&s;e, occa&s;ioned by our imitation of the Italian poets: and the poly&s;yllabic clo&s;e continued even below Fairfax. Lydgate, Rowley's cotemporary, is full of this unhar|monious chime. In&s;tances without number might be brought from his SIEGE OF THE|BES, written in couplets; but I quote one of his &s;tanzas, which accidentally meets my eye in opening his LYFE OF OUR LADY.</P>

<P>Yet Mr. Bryant ob&s;erves on this point,
<Q>&startq;Is there any thing extraordinary in a per&s;on of a good ear and ta&s;te, deviating from this manner of compo&s;ition, and following bet|&endq;ter examples?</Q>
But goodne&s;s of ta&s;te and of ear are, both, relative terms. Our learn|ed mythologi&s;t then proceeds, to &s;helter
<PB N="41" REF="42">
Rowley's legitimate terminations under the example of Robert of Glouce&s;ter, a much more antient bard, who clo&s;es his ver&s;es with a due &s;tability of pronunciation, and is free from this unnatural and unplea&s;ing empha&s;is.
<Q>&startq;Robert of Glouce&s;ter was no poet, but a mere ver&s;ifyer: yet he had ta&s;te enough to be &s;ometimes cautious about the poly&s;ylla|bic clo&s;ure. It is to be found oftener in ten lines of Lydgate, Gower, and even of Spen&s;er, than in an hundred of this writer. Hence we may perceive, that this mode of &endq;proceeding in Rowley was not new <NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">OBSERVATIONS upon Rowley's Poems, p. 446, 447.</NOTE>.</Q>
But, with &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to Mr. Bryant's great judgment, I apprehend it was not that Ro|bert of Glouce&s;ter had ta&s;te enough to avoid this defect. It was not from de&s;ign or choice. He wrote his Chronicle at a time, when our language con&s;i&s;ted almo&s;t entirely of mono|&s;yllables, and before its purity, or &s;implicity, was marred by the influx of a foreign phra&s;eology. His words are all Teutonic or radical: and frequently for twenty lines to|gether he does not afford five di&s;&s;yllables. Surely the quick-&s;ighted Rowley, who anti|cipated the beauties of future ages, and of poets yet unborn, would not have gone two
<PB N="42" REF="43">
centuries backward for a model. He would rather have acquie&s;ced in this laxity of the poly&s;yllabic termination, which was un|doubtedly now deemed a fa&s;hionable orna|ment, and an elegant departure from the plain monotonies of the primitive rhymers.</P>
<P N="3">III. ANTIENT LANGUAGE. The antient language of the&s;e poems is affected and un|natural. Antiquated expre&s;&s;ions are engrafted on pre&s;ent modes of &s;peech.
<Q>&startq;Old Ed|&endq;ward's armour beams on Cibber's brea&s;t.</Q>
Sometimes a modern &s;tyle predominates, to the exclu&s;ion of the antient: and the tin&s;el of a poli&s;hed phra&s;eology is but thinly tinged with the ru&s;t of antiquity. The diction and ver&s;ification are at perpetual variance. Our author is &s;mooth and mellifluous as Pope and Ma&s;on, and yet more ob&s;cure and inexpli|cable than Gower or Chaucer. He has given a hardne&s;s and a &s;tiffne&s;s even to ob|&s;olete language. He &s;ays, in &s;peaking of the antient builders at Bri&s;tol,
<Q>And eche dygne builder dequac'd onn mie mynde <NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">ST. C. 38.</NOTE>.</Q>
That is,
<Q>&startq;Each illu&s;trious buider da&s;hed &endq;upon my mind.</Q>
The conclu&s;ion mu&s;t be,
<PB N="43" REF="44">
that he borrowed his language from glo&s;&s;a|ries and etymological Engli&s;h lexicons, and not from life or practice. But he borrowed without &s;election or di&s;cernment. He &s;eems to have been per&s;uaded, that no other ingre|dient was nece&s;&s;ary for his fiction than old words: and carele&s;s or ignorant of the appli|cation, which required the nice&s;t conduct and caution, he pre&s;umed he had accompli&s;hed his de&s;ign, by introducing as many antient terms, and of any antiquity, as he could col|lect. He viewed antient language as all of one age and one di&s;trict. In dictionaries of old Engli&s;h, he &s;aw words detached and &s;e|parated from their context: the&s;e he &s;eized and combined with others, without con&s;ider|ing their relative or other accidental &s;ignifi|cation. Here too, he found the peculiarities of northern and &s;outhern dialects, thrown together for general explanation: the&s;e he carele&s;sly blended, not ob&s;erving their re|&s;pective local appropriations. This confu&s;ion has been increa&s;ed by mi&s;pellings, proceeding either from choice, ignorance, or accident, and by inflections at once ungrammatical and arbitrary. Thus has he fabricated a factitious antient diction, at once ob&s;olete and hetero|geneous, anomalous in every re&s;pect, &s;uch as never could have been in u&s;e at any era of
<PB N="44" REF="45">
antiquity, is not tran&s;mitted by any antient Engli&s;h author, and mo&s;t certainly would have been almo&s;t as little under&s;tood three centuries ago, as at pre&s;ent. Thus has he produced &s;uch a &s;y&s;tem of language, &s;uch a di&s;cordant ti&s;&s;ue of words of di&s;tant provinces and di&s;tant periods, as never before coexi&s;ted. Again, this motley mixture of the modes of antient language being worked into a modern ground, has compounded &s;uch a <HI>pa&s;ticcio</HI> of &s;tyle, as is &s;till more unexampled and extravagant.</P>
<P>Mr. Bryant has this fundamental po&s;ition.
<Q>&startq;One of the fir&s;t po&s;itions which I mu&s;t lay down, is, that the&s;e poems were written in a <HI>provincial</HI> dialect: according to the idiom of the people in who&s;e country the &endq;author re&s;ided, and was probably born <NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">OBSERVATIONS, p. 1.</NOTE>.</Q>
How did it happen, that Rowley, who is afterwards &s;aid by Mr. Bryant to have been of Somer&s;et&s;hire <NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 10.</NOTE>, &s;hould at once &s;hake off his provincial habits of &s;peech, his native peculiarities of pronuntiation, his barbarous dialect, and uncouth phra&s;es, and write &s;o clear &s;o intelligible a poem as SIR CHARLES BAWDIN?</P>
<P>Yet of this poem the Dean ob&s;erves, that
<PB N="45" REF="46">
the modern complexion of the language and metre,
<Q>&startq;may be accounted for from the na|ture of the &s;ubject, the clearne&s;s of the author's imagination, and from the harmo|ny of his ear. Every judicious poet will adapt his language to the &s;tyle of poetry in which he writes; and it may be ob&s;erved, that Rowley has clo&s;ely followed the ad|vice of Horace, in the magnificent words, and <HI>compound epithets</HI>, which appear &s;o frequently in his epic and dramatic pieces. And, on the other hand, with what ea&s;e and &s;moothne&s;s does his language flow in the Songs and Eclogues! How plain and familiar is the &s;tile of this poem! How &s;uitable to that of all the antient Ballads &endq;which relate &s;uch dolefull events <NOTE N="w" PLACE="foot">Milles's ROWLEY, p. 324.</NOTE>!</Q></P>
<P>To &s;ay nothing, that &s;tyle and language are here confounded, and that no other poet of Rowley's age has ever followed Horace's advice concerning compound epithets, I will allow, that every judicious writer will adapt his language to his &s;pecies of poetry. But if Mr. Bryant's &s;uppo&s;ition be true, Rowley, whatever his judgement or even his genius might have been, had no choice of language. He po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed not the means nor the powers
<PB N="46" REF="47">
of this adaptation. Neither nature of &s;ubject, clearne&s;s of imagination, nor harmony of ear, could have operated on a writer under the dominion of the Somer&s;et&s;hire dialect, and living in the fifteenth century. His dramas, epics, odes, and pa&s;torals, mu&s;t have been all equally and uniformly provincial. Had Robert of Glouce&s;ter ever cho&s;e to deviate into any of the&s;e varieties of compo|&s;ition, I pre&s;ume his language would have been ju&s;t as rough as it appears at pre&s;ent in his metrical hi&s;tory. As to the familiarity which doctor Milles a&s;&s;igns to the ballad-&s;tyle, and in which SIR CHARLES BAWDIN is &s;uppo&s;ed to be written, that circum&s;tance mu&s;t have added greatly to the provinciality, and con&s;equently to the unintelligibility, of the poem. I omit other poems, nor do I repeat circum&s;tances already mentioned, which alike tend to demon&s;trate, that the idea of founding the difficulties or the &s;ingu|larities of Rowley's language on the anoma|lies of any provincial dialect, is improbable and indefen&s;ible.</P>
<P>Mr. Bryant &s;uppo&s;es, that Chatterton has &s;hewn a want of knowledge in writing or explaining the old words of the&s;e poems, and therefore concludes, he was not the compo&s;er but only the tran&s;criber. I will examine
<PB N="47" REF="48">
this part of his argument in a few in&s;tances. Nor is it my intention to in&s;titute a formal and &s;cientific di&s;qui&s;ition on Rowley's lan|guage, which I leave to the learning, the preci&s;ion, and dexterity, of Mr. Tyrwhit. I only mean to give a general &s;pecimen of the futile principles on which this very plau&s;ible plea has been conducted, and to &s;hew how ea&s;ily it may be confuted.</P>

This, Mr. Bryant &s;ays, is not a grange. It is moreover objected, that a farmer, by whom the words are &s;poken, could not have a <HI>park</HI>, nor keep a <HI>parker</HI>. Mr. Bryant therefore determines, with &s;ufficient latitude of conjecture, that Chatterton in the manu&s;cript mi&s;took <HI>parker</HI> for <HI>parklich</HI>, or <HI>parklike</HI>. Of <HI>Grange</HI>, a word, by the way, not quite ob&s;olete, and occurring in Shake&s;peare, Chatterton gave a vague unpreci&s;e explanation from his own head, or from imperfect remembrance. As to <HI>parker</HI>, it is ea&s;y by the force of ingenious gue&s;&s;es to make &s;en&s;e out of non&s;en&s;e.

He threw together, and then explained, antient words at random. The whole, to adopt the deci&s;ion of the learned objector, "is a <HI>boyi&s;h</HI> mi&s;take." Chat|terton had no other originals before him but his own genuine compo&s;itions: which having duely &s;ea&s;oned with a quantity of ob&s;olete terms ha&s;tily or un&s;kilfully collected, he afterwards interpreted, as he could, in as carele&s;s a glo&s;&s;ary.</P>

<P>But Chatterton, if not from Skinner, took the word immediately from Speght's glo&s;&s;ary to Chaucer, where it is interpreted thus, "PARAMENTS. Robes of &s;tate." Our &s;up|po&s;ed tran&s;criber of antient originals, often poached in Speght's glo&s;&s;ary, for old words, to &s;tiffen his modern poetry. This was certainly one of the <HI>originals</HI> from which he <HI>tran&s;cribed</HI>. We are informed, that Chatter|ton's glo&s;&s;ary of Speght's Chaucer, interlined with Chatterton's own hand, is in the po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of a gentleman of Cambridge. As none of the interlineations have tran&s;pired, we may &s;u&s;pect on which &s;ide of the que&s;tion they would throw mo&s;t light. Mr. Bryant adds,
<Q>&startq;The word occurs in two different

<HI>Lordynge</HI> is explained by Chatterton, <HI>the toad &s;tanding on its hind legs</HI>. This was one of the horrid impediments of the u&s;urper's progre&s;s. And the exaggeration is very poe|tical. But Mr. Bryant infers, that here is another gro&s;s mi&s;take of the tran&s;criber.
<Q>&startq;Who, &s;ays he, ever &s;aw a toad in this &endq;&s;trange attitude <NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">OBSERVATIONS, p. 283.</NOTE>?</Q>
Perhaps nobody but a poet. This wonderful and unnatural appear|ance is imagined, to heighten the terrours of the &s;cene. The annotator then adds the <HI>true</HI> interpretation, as if from Rowley him&s;elf. "By <HI>lordyng</HI> is &s;ignified, <HI>dull</HI> and <HI>heavy</HI>." And he in&s;inuates that Rowley might write <HI>lourdan</HI>. If Chatterton is here only the tran&s;criber and interpreter of Rowley, he has certainly introduced a beauty not intend|ed in his original. The context &s;hews that our youth is right; and that he here, as in other places, perfectly under&s;tood his own meaning and his own poetry. All the&s;e loath&s;om animals are repre&s;ented as rou&s;ed, and in action, to &s;top the king. The owl flaps her wing: the adders leap forward and dart their &s;tings: and the toad, in a po&s;ture not con&s;i&s;tent with his u&s;ual &s;luggi&s;hne&s;s, appears in every path. In &s;ome picture of the
<PB N="53" REF="54">

<P>A wild devious cour&s;e of a river is called <HI>bi&s;mare</HI>. Chatterton's interpretation is, <HI>bewildered, curious</HI>.
<Q>&startq;The&s;e epithets, &s;ays Mr. Bryant, he couples together, as if they were &s;ynonimous: but they neither &endq;of them convey the true meaning <NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">OBSERVATIONS, p. 65.</NOTE>.</Q> At lea&s;t, they convey Chatterton's meaning. Had Chatterton, continues the critic,
<Q>&startq;been the author of the&s;e compo&s;itions, he would have introduced the word in the &s;ame ac|ceptation in which it is to be found in &endq;Chaucer <NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 67.</NOTE>.</Q>
But Chatterton did not read our old poets for a hard word: he con&s;ulted their glo&s;&s;ari&s;ts, a more commodious &s;ort of writers. In his old friend Speght he &s;aw, "BISMARE. fanta&s;ticall &s;trangene&s;&s;e." Chau|cer's context, which he did not think it nece&s;&s;ary to examine, and in which he could not have ea&s;ily found the word, would have &s;hewn him that Speght and his author did not always agree.</P>

As to impropriety of expre&s;&s;ion, this is pro|po&s;ed to be removed by reading <HI>nipped</HI>. But a better is not always a right reading.

This would have been too familiar an idea. But he looked no fur|ther than Speght, who gives only the general unappropriated &s;en&s;e. This Chatterton ex|tended to a metaphor. When he wanted an old word, he did not always chu&s;e the be&s;t.</P>

Undoubtedly, in the pre&s;ent in&s;tance, the Saracens might be more properly called <HI>acur&s;ed</HI>, than <HI>dimini&s;hed</HI>. But AMENUSED was too &s;tately a participle or epithet to be pa&s;&s;ed over. It fitted a place in his ver&s;e, and he had little farther anxiety about it. He tru&s;ted it to chance. His readers might, or might not, attend to pre|ci&s;e propriety of &s;ignification. On the &s;ame thoughtle&s;s principle, and inattentive to future examination or detection, he manife&s;t|ly forged many old words, which pa&s;s as antient current coin in doctor Milles's Glo&s;|&s;ary to Rowley, entitled, A GLOSSARY OF UNCOMMON WORDS.</P>
<P>But the mo&s;t &s;pecious and boa&s;ted in&s;tance of mi&s;conception and fal&s;e tran&s;cription lies in the following line.
<Q>Could&s;te thou not kenn, mo&s;t &s;kyll'd, After la goure <NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">B. H. ii.143.</NOTE>.</Q>
Here &s;ays Mr. Bryant,

<PB N="56" REF="57">
<HI>After la gour:</HI> and he has ab&s;olutely dis|joined the con&s;tituent parts, and taken it for a proper name, the name of a Norman of &s;ome con&s;equence. He accordingly forgets the real per&s;on &s;poken of, and addre&s;&s;es this After La Gour as a per&s;on of <HI>&s;cience</HI>.
<Q>Could&s;te than not <HI>kenne</HI>, mo&s;t <HI>&s;kyll'd</HI> After la gour?</Q>
He thought it was analagous to Delacour, &endq;Delamere, &amp;c <NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">OBSERVATIONS, p. 155.</NOTE>.</Q> But I do not remember, that <HI>A&s;terlagour</HI> was ever u&s;ed for <HI>A&s;trologer</HI>. The word occurs once, and but once, in Chaucer, where it &s;ignifies the old a&s;tronomical in&s;trument called an <HI>A&s;trolabe</HI>.
<Q><L>His ASTERLAGOUR longing for [to] his art,</L>
<L>His augrim &s;tonis, &amp;c <NOTE N="w" PLACE="foot">MILL. T. edit. Urr. p. 25. v.111.</NOTE>.</L></Q>
The learned Rowley mu&s;t have known better, than to have called an A&s;trologer by the name of one of his in&s;truments. The truth of the matter is this. Chatterton, in Speght's Glo&s;&s;ary, found
<Q>&startq;ASTERLAGOUR. &endq;an A&s;trolabe.</Q>
He wanted a hard word for A&s;trologer, for which he u&s;ed <HI>A&s;terlagour</HI>, I will not &s;ay whether by de&s;ign or inadver|tency. Afterwards, perhaps in writing over the poem, and de&s;erting or forgetting his fir&s;t
<PB N="57" REF="58">
meaning, he wantonly and very incon&s;iderate|ly corrupted the word into <HI>After la gour</HI>. Or accidentally looking back into Speght, and finding he had mi&s;taken Speght's inter|pretation, thought of this bungling artifice to make all right. Thus much is certain, that Rowley, the pretended compo&s;er of the&s;e poems, could not po&s;&s;ibly have u&s;ed <HI>A&s;terla|gour</HI>, the word &s;uppo&s;ed to have been in the original manu&s;cript, in the &s;en&s;e here required. He never could have confounded the arti&s;t with his machine, then well known by this appellation. On the whole, I leave the conclu&s;ion to the unprejudiced reader.</P>
<P>That Chatterton was no tran&s;criber, that he neither mi&s;under&s;tood nor mi&s;interpreted antient originals, that he had recour&s;e to glo&s;&s;aries either to accumulate a &s;tock of old words, or in order to &s;ub&s;titute old in the place of his own new words, that he &s;ome|times ha&s;tily copied, imperfectly remember|ed, frequently mi&s;apprehended, and often &s;uperficially or ca&s;ually in&s;pected tho&s;e glo&s;|&s;aries, that he occa&s;ionally fabricated difficult words, in &s;hort, that he compo&s;ed both poems and explanations, is I hope &s;ufficient|ly clear, from this &s;hort &s;ketch of an argu|ment, which forms &s;o con&s;iderable a part of Mr. Bryant's very learned vindication of
<PB N="58" REF="59">
Rowley. Chatterton con&s;ulted the&s;e helps, not to elucidate the ob&s;olete phra&s;es of an antient writer, but to give his own perform|ances the &s;tamp of antiquity: to darken his own meaning, not to illu&s;trate the ob&s;curities of others. Let us add to his negligence or inexperience, that the glo&s;&s;aries he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed were often erroneous or incomplete. What he could not find, he made: and often mi&s;|took or mi&s;repre&s;ented what he found. He &s;ometimes omits to explain his old words: but it is well known, that his poetry and his interpretation were not always written at the &s;ame time. Many of his marginal com|ments were extemporaneous productions at the reque&s;t of friends. Nor did he always retain the exact &s;ignification in which he had fir&s;t u&s;ed an old word. Thus was he fre|quently compelled to depend upon confu&s;ed recollection, or uncertain conjecture. Thus his explanations are often licentious, or inadequate.</P>
<P>Mr. Bryant frequently repeats an axiom, that every author mu&s;t know his own mean|ing. This may be true. But every forger of old poetry does not always know the meaning of other men: that is, he does not always exactly know, either the meaning, or the proper application, of all the antique
<PB N="59" REF="60">
words which he finds it nece&s;&s;ary to adopt. Chatterton, however, knew his original and primary meaning. But writing under the con&s;traint and the difficulties of a forgery which con&s;i&s;ted in the u&s;e of a remote and unfamiliar language, his natural expre&s;&s;ion was ob&s;tructed. What mo&s;t writers wi&s;h to attain, he was compelled to avoid, per&s;picuity. He was obliged to embarra&s;s a meaning, at fir&s;t clear. And this he practiced with too little care and judgement. He under&s;tood what he wrote, but he could not always explain what he wrote. What he had written, he was afterwards forced to render unintelligible. And in this proce&s;s, not always managed with &s;ufficient addre&s;s, he &s;ometimes puzzled both him&s;elf and his readers.</P>
<P>Mr. Bryant clo&s;es his volume with the following illu&s;tration.
<Q>&startq;Whoever brings a copy of a prior writing, and does not un|der&s;tand that writing, that per&s;on cannot be the author. In &s;hort, if a boy pro|duces a reputable exerci&s;e, and cannot con&s;true it, there is not an u&s;her at a boarding-&s;chool but will tell him he did &endq;not make it <NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">OBSERVATIONS, p. 585.</NOTE>.</Q> But if a ma&s;ter was to
<PB N="60" REF="61">
order a &s;cholar, to bring an exerci&s;e, written in Chaucer's &s;tyle, and the boy, not having a competent knowledge of old Engli&s;h, could not afterwards very readily explain his ta&s;k, the ma&s;ter would not tell him that he did not make it becau&s;e he could not explain it, but would blame him for his un&s;kilful u&s;e of Chaucer's language, and direct him to &s;tudy it with more attention.</P>
<P N="4">IV. HISTORICAL ALLUSIONS. The&s;e poems are &s;uppo&s;ed to contain a fund of re|ferences to curious hi&s;torical facts now for|gotten. Mr. Bryant a&s;&s;erts, that,

<P>It is a&s;ked, how Chatterton could have gained a knowledge of the raven-&s;tandard of

But Chatterton &s;eems to have had his intel|ligence from Thom&s;on's MASQUE OF AL|FRED, a common play-book, where the Raven-&s;tandard of the Danes is thus poetically de&s;cribed.
<Q><L>&mdash; Is not yon pictur'd raven</L>

Let me add, that Chatterton's idea of writing a play on a Dani&s;h &s;tory might have been &s;ugge&s;ted by this very Ma&s;que. He is allowed to have been a reader of Thom&s;on. It is al&s;o to be ob&s;erved, that both dramas are built on the &s;ame point of the Dani&s;h hi&s;tory in England, the Landing of the Danes in Somer&s;et&s;hire. One of Chatterton's per&s;ons is Hurra. Mr. Bryant &s;ays, that the proper name HUBBA might by an <HI>unexperienced tran&s;criber</HI> be ea&s;ily taken for HURRA <NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Ubi &s;upr. p. 175.</NOTE>. It is very true, that Hubba is the right read|ing, as Chatterton well knew from the&s;e lines in his favourite Thom&s;on's Ma&s;que.
<Q><L>The valiant HUBBA bites the bloody field,</L>
<L>With twice &s;ix hundred Danes around him &s;trow'd <NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Sc. iv.</NOTE>.</L></Q>
<PB N="63" REF="64">
Chatterton, I pre&s;ume, might have his rea&s;ons for converting Hubba into HURRA.</P>
<P>In the&s;e poems, Ella is called the warden of Bri&s;tol ca&s;tle, in the Dani&s;h wars. But before the Conque&s;t, Bri&s;tol was a very in|con&s;iderable place. It is never once men|tioned in our hi&s;tories of tho&s;e bloody en|gagements, which were fought all about its neighbourhood between the Saxons and Danes. It did not begin to flouri&s;h or to be fortified, till after the total extinction of the Anglo-Saxon government. The fir&s;t notice of its ca&s;tle is, under the year 1087 <NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Sub. ann. p. 193.20.</NOTE>, in the Saxon Chronicle: which is &s;aid by Robert of Glouce&s;ter, to have been built by Robert Rufus earl of Glouce&s;ter. This mu&s;t have been about the reign of Rufus. That chro|nicler &s;ays, that earl Robert not only found|ed the ca&s;tle, but adorned it with a noble tower,
<Q>&startq;which of all the tours of Englonde &endq;ys yhelde the flour <NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Chron. p. 43. edit. Hearne.</NOTE>.</Q>
In &s;hort, it was one of tho&s;e new fortre&s;&s;es of the eleventh cen|tury, which it was the policy of the Nor|mans, at their acce&s;&s;ion, to erect in various parts of England, for the &s;ecurity of their dubious title. Had this ca&s;tle actually ex|exi&s;ted
<PB N="64" REF="65">
as a &s;trong we&s;tern garri&s;on under the warden&s;hip of our hero Ella, and of &s;ufficient con&s;equence to have made a &s;tout re&s;i&s;tance again&s;t the incur&s;ions of the Danes, it mu&s;t have been mentioned long before by the monki&s;h hi&s;torians. More e&s;pecially as they record minutely, many con&s;iderable conflicts with the Dani&s;h invaders in Somer&s;et&s;hire. Why then is Bri&s;tol, with its ca&s;tle, omit|ted? I fear we &s;hall find no other accounts of Ella's invincible prowe&s;s again&s;t the Danes in the ninth century, at or near Bri&s;tol, than what are recorded in Chatterton's unpubli&s;h|ed Hi&s;tory of Bri&s;tol, by the monk Turgott, a manu&s;cript of equal authenticity with his TRAGEDY OF ELLA. Mr. Bryant con|cludes, that Bri&s;tol was a place of celebrity even before the time of king Athel&s;tan: be|cau&s;e Robert of Glouce&s;ter points out Pucklechurch, the place where king Edward, Athel&s;tan's brother, was &s;lain, by its being in the vicinity of Bri&s;tol. But Robert of Glou|ce&s;ter, who wrote about 1200, in pointing out an ob&s;cure village, refers to the neigh|bouring town of Bri&s;tol, as being then of &s;ufficient and di&s;tingui&s;hed note. It by no means follows, that Bri&s;tol was a place of note, when that event happened <NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Ubi &s;upr. p. 201. Rob. Glouc. p. 277.</NOTE>.</P>

But of equal antiquity, and &s;till continuing to appear, are the formidable nocturnal meteors in mora&s;&s;es, commonly called <HI>Will of the wi&s;p</HI>, and <HI>Jack a lantern</HI>.

<Q>&startq;When we view Canning, accompanied with the&s;e three poets, who&s;e agreeable conver&s;ation he has celebrated in the ACCOUNT OF THE FEAST, can we forbear drawing the pa|rallel between this party, and that of Me|cenas, with his three friends, Virgil, Horace, and Varius, united by the &s;imilar ties of friend&s;hip, genius, and poetry? The compari&s;on, however, will be much to the advantage of Mr. Canning, who not only equalled Mecenas in liberality, and in the patronage of literature, but was &endq;al&s;o a better man, and a better poet <NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Milles's ROWLEY, p. 191.</NOTE>.</Q>
I own, I think the dean has carried the parallel rather too far. But every man has his favourite authors. Yet that this worthy mayor of Bri&s;tol was a better man than
<PB N="67" REF="68">
Mecenas, I will not di&s;pute. I think how|ever, it may be doubted, whether Canynge was a better poet than Mecenas. If &s;ome of Mecenas's poetry had been luckily recovered in the Redcliffe repo&s;itory with Rowley's and Canynge's, this point might have been decided.</P>
<P>We are told, that many of the incidents in the BATTLE OF HASTINGS, &s;uch as the licentiou&s;ne&s;s of the Engli&s;h army, and the exact di&s;cipline of the Norman on the night of the battle, Harold's exploration of the Norman camp, and the reception of his &s;pies of by duke William, Girtha's mi&s;take that the Norman &s;oldiers were prie&s;ts di&s;|gui&s;ed in armour, with other circum&s;tances, are entirely conformable to the de&s;cription of this battle in Malme&s;bury, and the re&s;t of the old Latin chroniclers <NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">See Milles's Rowley, pp. 98.100.111. etc.</NOTE>. To &s;uch authors Chatterton could not have had acce&s;s. But all the&s;e particulars, which are repre&s;ented as my&s;teries, may be &s;een in Hollin&s;head, who tran&s;lated and incorporated the&s;e authors in his voluminous and circum&s;tantial hi&s;tory of England. From thence they have de&s;cended into &s;ome later hi&s;torians. I do not parti|cularly recollect in Hollin&s;head, nor am I
<PB N="68" REF="69">
inclined to &s;earch in that va&s;t ocean of black letter, whether he has mentioned ROW|LAND'S SONGE, with which William in our author begins the battle <NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">B. H. ii.232.</NOTE>. But Chatterton had certainly &s;een the three elegant volumes of antient ballads. In this poem of the BATTLE OF HASTINGS, the fir&s;t writer, &s;uppo&s;ed to be Turgott a cotemporary, is &s;aid by doctor Milles to have
<Q>&startq;pointed out the origin and u&s;e of Stonehenge, &s;o little &endq;known by our antient writers <NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">See Milles's ROWLEY, p. 71. &s;eq.</NOTE>.</Q>
But what origin, and what u&s;es, are here pointed out, that do not appear in modern books? And it is to be ob&s;erved, that the writer has a&s;&s;igned almo&s;t every origin, and every u&s;e, which modern conjectures, or antient hi&s;torians, have given. This is what Turgott probably would not, or rather could not, have done. Our poet, however, &s;eems mo&s;t inclined to believe, at lea&s;t in&s;inuates, that this wonder|ful monument was erected in con&s;equence of Hengi&s;t's ma&s;&s;acre. I am happy to find this a&s;&s;ignation of Stonehenge, which I cur&s;orily hazarded in my fir&s;t volume of the Hi&s;tory of Engli&s;h poetry, a&s;certained by &s;o authentic an hi&s;torian as Turgott! Yet at the &s;ame time, he &s;uppo&s;es, that it might have
<PB N="69" REF="70">
been a Druidical temple. And this &s;uppo&s;ition I afterwards in&s;tanced as a proof of Chatter|ton's forgery, ob&s;erving, that the notion, that
<Q>&startq;the Druids con&s;tructed this &s;tupendous pile for a place of wor&s;hip, was a DIS|COVERY re&s;erved for the SAGACITY of a WISER age, and the laborious DISCUSSION &endq;of MODERN ANTIQUARIES <NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;t. ENGL. POETR. ii.155.</NOTE>.</Q>
Here I am accu&s;ed by doctor Milles of wavering between two opinions <NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Milles's ROWLEY, p. 76.</NOTE>. Who does not perceive, that this paragraph never was in|tended as a &s;erious opinion or affirmation? I confe&s;s I cannot always treat the &s;trange &s;y&s;tems of Stukeley, of which this is a famous one, with the gravity of the pre&s;ident of the antiquarian &s;ociety. Doctor Milles him&s;elf, however, is &s;ometimes di&s;po&s;ed to be plea&s;ant: for upon MY AUTHORITY, that is, this my &s;econd &s;uppo&s;ed determina|tion, he propo&s;es to give up my former theory about Hengi&s;t's ma&s;&s;acre, and to re|mark the great improbability with which I found that theory on the evidence of the &s;ongs of the Saxon min&s;trels. But I certainly did not mean, that the Saxon min&s;trels had ever &s;ung a triumphal epinicion on Hengi&s;t's
<PB N="70" REF="71">
ma&s;&s;acre. It entered of cour&s;e into their min&s;trel&s;y as an hi&s;torical event, where it was undoubtedly dre&s;&s;ed up in their own favourable colours. The&s;e rude &s;ong&s;ters were not &s;o national, and &s;o nice, as we may &s;uppo&s;e. In their metrical chronicles they recited what happened without much &s;elec|tion or &s;uppre&s;&s;ion. Thus it tran&s;pired as a piece of hi&s;tory from the Saxon to the Wel&s;h bards, who by new aggravations would natu|rally turn it to the di&s;advantage of their enemies. Too palpable therefore is the mo|dern delicacy of the writer of the BATTLE OF HASTINGS, who thus &s;queami&s;hly intro|duces this tale of Saxon perfidy:
<Q>I, tho a Saxon, yet the truth will telle <NOTE N="w" PLACE="foot">B. H. i.312.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>But the learned dean's &s;tronge&s;t proof of a knowledge of genuine hi&s;tory in this poem, and by which he judges it to be mo&s;t un|que&s;tionably authenticated, is the agreement of the names of the Norman warriors, with tho&s;e printed in our hi&s;torians from the Chronicle of Normandy and the Battell-Abbey roll.
<Q>&startq;At lea&s;t, he adds, names &s;o nearly re&s;embling them, that allowing for mi&s;takes of tran&s;cribers, and difference of &s;pelling, they may be &s;atisfactorily veri|&endq;fied <NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Milles's ROWLEY, p. 152.</NOTE>.</Q>
<PB N="71" REF="72">
I draw a contrary and the mo&s;t na|tural conclu&s;ion. I am of opinion that on this occa&s;ion Chatterton u&s;ed a book not yet men|tioned, Fuller's CHURCH-HISTORY. How he could get acce&s;s to it, &s;hall be &s;hewn hereafter. In this book, all the rolls and catalogues are drawn together, from Hollin&s;|head, Fox, and Stowe, and comparatively arranged <NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Edit. Lond. 1655. Cent. xi. B. ii. p. 155. &s;eq. At the end follows the Ely tablet, where is the name of Nigel a Norman knight, u&s;ed by Chatterton, on which Mr. Bryant has expended a wa&s;te of learned re&s;earch, OBS. p. 346.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>I cannot but here ob&s;erve, that Chatterton could not have cho&s;en from our hi&s;tory, a more commodious &s;ubject for a poem than the Battle of Ha&s;tings, exclu&s;ive of its &s;u&s;|ceptibility of poetical ornament, and of its coincidence with his predominant predilection for antiquarian imagery. This &s;ubject po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;es the &s;ingular advantage of having the names of its heroes, on one &s;ide at lea&s;t, en|umerated at large in an original cotemporary record.</P>
<P>Meanwhile, how comes it pa&s;s, that &s;o many of the Normans are mentioned in this poem, and &s;o few of the Saxons? It is &s;trange that the original author Turgott, an
<PB N="72" REF="73">
Anglo-Saxon, &s;hould not have commemora|ted more of his countrymen. Why does he dwell &s;o largely, and almo&s;t &s;olely, on the names of his enemies? For this plain rea&s;on. Chatterton had no long roll of Saxon names, to which he might refer. Of the Normans he had a li&s;t of eight hundred, from which he might chu&s;e at plea&s;ure. Not twenty Saxon names, including Harold's three bro|thers, To&s;ti, Girtha, and Leofwyne, known from our hi&s;torians, are here recited. All the&s;e, however, are &s;uppo&s;ed by Mr. Bryant to be the names of Saxons
<Q>&startq;of great rank and eminence in their time, and of large &endq;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions <NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Ut &s;upr. p. 373.</NOTE>.</Q>
He adds, that all the&s;e names are to be found in Doom&s;day-book. Now that curious and ample record, containing the forfeitures of all the property of England at the Conque&s;t, then in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Saxon lords, is ab&s;olutely a Saxon nomenclature. I will not &s;uppo&s;e that Chatterton had &s;een Doom&s;day-book. He took his few Saxon names, by memory, from plays, poems, novels, hi&s;tories, and other books of enter|tainment. Had he taken a hundred more, they would all perhaps have tallied with Doom&s;day-book. It would have been ex|extraordinary
<PB N="73" REF="74">
indeed, not to have di&s;covered parallels to the&s;e few names, in that com|prehen&s;ive repo&s;itory of antient hereditary property.</P>
<P>Mr. Bryant is of opinion, that the BATTLE OF HASTINGS contains a <HI>ma&s;s of occult intelligence</HI>, in many <HI>ob&s;cure references</HI>, and <HI>dark hints</HI>. This is a ma&s;s which I cannot penetrate. The poem, as we have &s;een, is &s;uppo&s;ed to have been originally written by Turgott, a coeval eccle&s;ia&s;tic. But a writer &s;o connected with the times, a pro|fe&s;&s;ed hi&s;torian, and who was here the author of a &s;eparate and di&s;tinct narrative of this &s;ingle event, mu&s;t have treated the &s;ubject with minutene&s;s and particularity. He was drawing from the life, and recording recent facts. This newly di&s;covered manu&s;cript of Turgott, mu&s;t have mentioned anecdotes not now to be found in our hi&s;tories, or have related tho&s;e already recorded, with addi|tional circum&s;tances, with a le&s;s degree of generality, and a variety of new particulars. But unluckily, we &s;ee little more than the well-known, e&s;tabli&s;hed, leading incidents. Some few poetical or imaginary in&s;ertions excepted, this memorable Battle is much the &s;ame in Hollin&s;head as in Turgott. I am &s;peaking of real facts, &s;uch as properly belong
<PB N="74" REF="75">
to this event as a piece of hi&s;tory, and &s;uch as Turgott would have naturally told. As to tho&s;e <HI>occult intelligences</HI>, in&s;tanced by Mr. Bryant, <HI>Tynyan's necromancy</HI>, the <HI>goats of Conyan made tame</HI>, and the &s;ouls of the <HI>fairy-&s;tricken</HI> people that wander to <HI>Offa's dyke</HI>, they are extraneous, and the &s;port of the poet. Tynyan is an old Briti&s;h king in Geoffrey of Monmouth. So little is known of this monarch, that he was &s;afely and ea&s;ily converted into a necromancer. The <HI>Goats of Conyan</HI> might be an allu&s;ion, to amu&s;e and deceive, without any meaning at the bottom. We mu&s;t not always treat fan|cies as my&s;teries. There are now remembered many romantic traditions, &s;uch as that of the &s;ouls of the <HI>fairy-&s;tricken people</HI>. But this might have &s;prung from Chatterton's imagination, for it is by no means out of the &s;tyle and ca&s;t of modern fiction. All the&s;e may be &s;aid to have been added to Turgott by Rowley. It is at lea&s;t as probable, that they came from Chatterton. They certainly did not fall from the pen of an archdeacon, a prior of an epi&s;copal church, and a con&s;cientious annali&s;t. At lea&s;t they would not have been introduced by Turgott into the grave dignity of an hi&s;toric detail.</P>
<P><PB N="75" REF="76">Mr. Bryant ju&s;tly ob&s;erves, that

I grant, a forger of an old hi&s;torical poem, for an obvious rea&s;on, will dwell on the well-known facts. His additions will be tho&s;e of decoration only. As to <HI>dark</HI> and <HI>un&s;atisfactory</HI> allu&s;ions, the&s;e he may &s;afely hazard. They will add to the di&s;gui&s;e, and lead to no detection. He may &s;afely deviate into &s;uch innocent fictions as I have mentioned. In de&s;cribing a real battle fought nine hundred years ago, he will throw in &s;uch incidents of the fortune of a field, as are of general nature, and mu&s;t be|long to every battle. He will feign or borrow, without danger of di&s;covery by violating hi&s;torical truth, deaths, di&s;tor|tions, and wounds, rivers of blood, and hills of &s;lain, clattering of armour, and &s;howers of arrows. He may however be too cautious in attending to truth and probability, and avoid &s;uch gro&s;s mi&s;takes, as an antient author would not have avoided.

<P N="5">V. BATTLE OF HASTINGS, and ELLA A TRAGEDY. The&s;e are two poems, which although partaking in the &s;tronge&s;t degree of the general marks of forgery di&s;cernible in all the re&s;t, yet as &s;ubject to peculiar circum&s;tances, I mu&s;t con&s;ider &s;eparately.</P>
<P>I begin with the BATTLE OF HASTINGS. On this, re&s;ulting from nature of &s;ubject, &s;ome &s;u&s;picious circum&s;tances nece&s;&s;arily oc|curred under the la&s;t Head of HISTORICAL ALLUSIONS. I mean now to examine it in the view of an imitation of POPE'S HOMER.</P>
<P>It is not denied, that this poem is copied from the Iliad. Doctor Milles, for that rea&s;on, has placed it fir&s;t, in the collection: and he is of opinion that
<Q>&startq;it not only &endq;COPIES but EXCEEDS Homer <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Milles's ROWLEY, p. 45.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>I believe it will be difficult to prove, that Rowley, had ever &s;een the Iliad, either in the original Greek, or in a pro&s;e tran&s;lation. It is evident that Rowley's cotemporary Lyd|gate, a &s;cholar, and one who might then be
<PB N="77" REF="78">
called a general reader, was totally unac|quainted with Homer. He has written pro|fe&s;&s;edly on Homer's &s;ubject, the &s;iege of Troy. But his author was Guido de Colon|na, who turned, about the twelfth century, the &s;tory of the Trojan war into a romance, not from Homer, but from Dictys Creten&s;is. And this, in England at lea&s;t, was the fa&s;hionable Iliad of the fifteenth century. Where had Rowley ever &s;een a copy of Homer? In the library of his convent at Kein&s;ham, or of the Carmelites at Bri&s;tol, where he is &s;aid to have &s;tudied? How had he acquired a knowledge of the Greek lan|guage? It was not at that time either taught or cultivated in England. Were Rowley's connections with any of tho&s;e few Engli&s;h &s;cholars who now travelled into that country where the Greek writers were revived? The Redcliffe che&s;t has given us no information of a his learned character. Surely, one who mu&s;t have had &s;o full and familiar an ac|quaintance with Homer, as to transfu&s;e his de&s;criptions with &s;o much ea&s;e and intelli|gence, mu&s;t have left papers or parchments of a cla&s;&s;ical or a literary kind. We are told of his Saxon, but not of his Grecian manu|&s;cripts. Nor do I conceive that Rowley could have &s;een a pro&s;e Latin tran&s;lation of
<PB N="78" REF="79">
the Iliad. Leontius Pilatus, one of the learned Con&s;tantinopolitan exiles, tran&s;lated the Iliad into Latin pro&s;e, with part of the Ody&s;&s;ey, at the de&s;ire of Boccace, about the year 1360, as we learn from Petrarch's Epi&s;tles to Boccace <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">SENIL. Lib. ii. Cap. 5.</NOTE>. But this was never publi&s;hed, and went no further than the public library of Venice <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Hody, GR. ILLUSTR. Lib. i. p. 5. &s;eq.</NOTE>. The fir&s;t pro&s;e Latin Iliad that appeared in public, was by Laurentius Valla, and it was printed at Bre&s;cia in Italy, in the year 1497. This came too late to have been &s;een by Rowley. We are therefore left to conclude, that an Engli&s;h Iliad was u&s;ed on this occa&s;ion. But Rowley never had &s;een the ver&s;ions by Chap|man, Hobbes, or Pope. Can it now be doubted that the BATTLE OF HASTINGS was written by Chatterton?</P>
<P>Indeed, with regard to the purport of our main argument, it matters not, which of the three Engli&s;h tran&s;lations was u&s;ed by Chatterton. But it is more than probable, that this general reader and imitator of our modern poets, could not have been unac|quainted with POPE'S HOMER. Hence the Homeric circum&s;tances of the BATTLE OF
<PB N="79" REF="80">
HASTINGS. Hence the contexture of the ver&s;ification, and animation of the narrative. Hence, to change Rowley for Chatterton, and to u&s;e doctor Milles's forcible expre&s;&s;ions,
<Q>&startq;he makes his numbers harmonious, without weakening the force of his ideas: he is &s;onorous but not bomba&s;t: and can de|&s;cribe the great convul&s;ions of nature, in terms more maje&s;tic and &s;ignificant than Addi&s;on's, <HI>Wreck of matter, and the cru&s;h &endq;of worlds</HI><NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Milles's ROWLEY, p. 114.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>But I lay the greate&s;t &s;tre&s;s on the com|pari&s;ons, that ornamental part of POPE'S HOMER &s;o likely to &s;trike a young mind. The dean of Exeter ob&s;erves,
<Q>&startq;The rapi|dity of Rowley's imagination is a &s;tranger to repo&s;e: the mind of the reader can hardly have dige&s;ted the torrent of &s;imilies on Kenelwalche's beauty, when he finds the valour of Adhelm, celebrated by three &endq;allu&s;ions in the cour&s;e of one &s;tanza <NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 134.</NOTE>.</Q>
Who but a boy, fond of the florid and the de&s;criptive, and unable to check his career of fancy, could have poured forth &s;uch a torrent of indige&s;tible &s;imilies? His imagination, a <HI>&s;tranger to repo&s;e</HI>, de&s;troys even the repo&s;e of his readers.</P>
<P><PB N="80" REF="81">Our author compares a hero &s;lain and &s;tretched on the ground, to an oak ju&s;t felled. He adds, that the oak was felled,
<Q>To live a &s;econd time upon the main <NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">B. H. i.369.</NOTE>.</Q>
In Pope, the oak is only
<Q>&startq;to become a ma&s;t &endq;for &s;ome great admiral <NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">B. xvi.591.</NOTE>.</Q>
In Homer it is converted into &s;hip-timber. Here, &s;ays doc|tor Milles,

But it does not follow, that if Chatterton copied POPE'S HOMER, he there|fore always u&s;ed Pope's words or form of expre&s;&s;ion. It was ea&s;y here, as in many more in&s;tances, to enliven and improve: and Chatterton has plainly done it in a line per|fectly Popian. Nor has Pope here degraded Homer. At lea&s;t he thought there was a &s;ufficient dignity in words borrowed from Milton. But it is not hard to prove, that Chatterton &s;ometimes u&s;es Pope's expre&s;&s;ions. Thus, for Pope's <HI>&s;ilver cui&s;hes</HI><NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">IL. B. xix.398.</NOTE>, we have in the BATTLE OF HASTINGS, his <HI>Cui&s;he of &s;ilver</HI><NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">B.

did not exi&s;t in the fifteenth century. It was imported into our poetry by Spen&s;er.</P>
<P>I have here mentioned the &s;imilies on Kenelwalche's beauty. In the&s;e, as we have &s;een long ago, the ro&s;y lips, the &s;nowy bo|&s;om, the melodious voice, the auburn locks and the taper arms, of the Saxon dame, are mo&s;t luxuriantly illu&s;trated. Mr. Bryant &s;uppo&s;es, what is not held by doctor Milles, that the&s;e compari&s;ons originated from Tur|gott. But he has him&s;elf &s;ugge&s;ted a con&s;i|deration which materially tends to invalidate this hypothe&s;is, which may be extended to Rowley, and which at la&s;t naturally brings home the&s;e high colourings of female beauty to a youth of &s;trong pa&s;&s;ions and warm feel|ings. He very ju&s;tly remarks, that Turgott the prior of &s;aint Cuthbert's convent at Dur|ham,
<Q>&startq;expends more time in &s;peaking of the appearance and beauty of this lady, than is well decent for a di&s;ciple of &s;aint Cuthbert, and one devoted to celibacy and &endq;the cloi&s;ter <NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">OBSERVATIONS, p. 252. Of this very ungallant fraternity, Robert Gray&s;tanes, a monk of Durham, author of an HIS|TORIA DUNELMENSIS, about the year 1336, has the follow|ing anecdote, which I literally tran&s;late.
<Q>&startq;In ea&s;ter week, 1333, king Edward the third came to Durham, and was entertained in the Prior's lodgings. The next evening queen Philippa came in one day from Knare&s;burgh to Durham&punc; and not knowing the cu&s;tom of the mona&s;tery, pa&s;&s;ed through the gate to the Prior's lodgings, and there &s;upped with the king. When they went to re&s;t after &s;upper, it was intimated to his maje&s;ty by one of the monks, that Saint Cuthbert did not love the company of women. The queen immediately aro&s;e at the king's command; and covered only with a petticoat and cloak, ha&s;tily returned by the gate through which &s;he came, and went to the ca&s;tle: praying the Saint, that he would not puni&s;h her for what &s;he had &endq;done through ignorance.</Q>

<P><PB N="82" REF="83">On the whole, as Pope perpetually varies, dilates, and adorns, the &s;implicity of Homer, I perceive many pa&s;&s;ages which Chatterton has imitated from the Engli&s;h ver&s;ion, not to be traced in the Greek original. But no further inve&s;tigation &s;eems nece&s;&s;ary.

<P>I come now to the TRAGEDY OF ELLA. This is a Tragedy written at a time when plays, if any exi&s;ted, were nothing more than a ballad or &s;olitary recital, without plot or dialogue, and incapable of repre&s;entation. The piece before us is a regular drama. A &s;tiffne&s;s of ob&s;olete &s;tyle, a cumber&s;ome &s;tanza, and prolix &s;oliloquies, although the reciprocation of the dialogue is often entirely conformable to the modern practice, are almo&s;t the only ob&s;tacles that render it unfit for the &s;tage. It has the interpo&s;ition of a Chorus of Min&s;trels, which adapt their odes or &s;ongs to the moral of the piece.

<HI>incon&s;iderable advantages</HI> which doctor Milles is plea&s;ed to grant him, that he might per|haps have ju&s;t dipped into Shake&s;peare, Spen&s;er, Milton, and Pope; and &s;een a few plays at the Bri&s;tol theatre <NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Milles's ROWLEY, p. 162.</NOTE>. But let us &s;uppo&s;e, that &s;ome efforts were now making towards the legitimate drama: tho&s;e efforts never could have produced a performance &s;o fini&s;hed as ELLA. Nor would &s;uch high improvements in a popular exhibition &s;o &s;oon have been forgotten. Polite manners were beginning to emerge, and would not have &s;uffered a quick, much le&s;s a total relap&s;e.</P>
<P>It it well known to every &s;earcher into our antient &s;tage, that the mi&s;erable inter|ludes even of the decline of the &s;ixteenth century, are infinitely &s;ubordinate to every other &s;pecies of poetry then &s;ub&s;i&s;ting: that they are utterly de&s;titute of contrivance, cha|racter, &s;entiment, and even of common decorum. The truth is, the Tragedy of ELLA, to which I will add the imperfect Tragedy of GOODWYN, in which is the fine ode on Freedom, is indebted to the Grecian &s;chool, revived in the eighteenth century. Both are the effu&s;ions of a young mind, warm from &s;tudying Mr. Ma&s;on's ELFRIDA and CARACTACUS.</P>
<P><PB N="85" REF="86">It is another un&s;urmountable objection to the antiquity and authenticity of ELLA, that the &s;ubject is hi&s;torical or civil. Repre&s;en|tations of religious &s;ubjects, were only fa&s;hionable in the reign of Edward the fourth. And the&s;e, exclu&s;ive of the &s;ubject, by no means re&s;embled what we call a Play. They made a part of the great drama of &s;uper&s;tition. Rowley, as a prie&s;t, was very unlikely to have begun this heterodox inno|vation, and to have been the fir&s;t to compo&s;e a play not religious. The pious mayor of Bri&s;tol never would have patroni&s;ed &s;o profane a confe&s;&s;or. Churches were our chief theatres before the Reformation: and the <HI>dygne mai&s;tre</HI> Canynge, the builder of a church, would have more naturally em|ployed the dramatic talents of Rowley, to decorate his new edifice with the exhibi|tion of a &s;plendid MYSTERY. If Rowley had penetration and ta&s;te, yet he had caution, he had prudence, and a reverence for his e&s;tabli&s;hment. But Rowley proceeds &s;till farther. He openly defends his new attempt, not in a palliative apology, but in a peremp|tory declaration of his opinion of the ab&s;ur|dity of &s;criptural plays.

This was too bold and too refined a philo|&s;ophy for a prie&s;t of the fifteenth century. The fir&s;t line is ab&s;olute here&s;y, and would have expo&s;ed the writer to the cen&s;ure of the church.

<P>We are told, that this Tragedy abounds with le&s;&s;ons of morality: it could not therefore have been the work of a di&s;&s;olute and unprincipled youth. Chatterton certainly knew better, than to di&s;gu&s;t every decent reader by indulging his di&s;po&s;ition to profli|gacy. But vitious &s;entiments would at once have de&s;troyed his impo&s;ture.

But we will allow that there is great nature in this piece. And here we mu&s;t recur to the vigorous prematurity of Chatterton's under&s;tanding. It was not in books only that this boy &s;hewed his amazing intuition and compre|hen&s;ion. He looked on life with the &s;ame penetrating and pervading eye. His ob&s;er|vation on things was equally quick and exten&s;ive. His humour, his knowledge of the world, his attention to character, and his general perception of the modes of life, ap|pear in his numerous &s;atirical pieces both in pro&s;e and ver&s;e. When, after an education in a charity &s;chool, he was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from the attorney's de&s;k, and came to London a &s;tripling of &s;eventeen, we are &s;urpri&s;ed, to u&s;e the expre&s;&s;ive words of Mr. Walpole,

We wonder at the addre&s;s, the command, the facility, the ver&s;atility of mind, the acommodation of &s;entiment, with which in a &s;hort &s;pace of time he compo&s;ed a variety of pieces, and on &s;ubjects which u&s;ually require long ob&s;ervation and experience.</P>

<P>Before I di&s;mi&s;s this tragedy, I cannot but ob&s;erve, that there is &s;omething too ingenious and artificial, in Rowley's a&s;&s;uming this mode of celebrating an old champion of Bri&s;tol, &s;uppo&s;ing that &s;uch a one ever exi&s;ted: and in dre&s;&s;ing up an antient tale with a plot and fictitious characters. Had he been capable of writing a tragedy, it is improbable that he &s;hould have taken a &s;tory from &s;uch a remote antiquity. It is more probable, that this &s;tory was &s;elected for a tragedy, in a refined age, when poetry looks back on antient man|ners with delight as mo&s;t &s;triking to the ima|gination, and as mo&s;t fit for her operations; and when the arts of writing had been carried to perfection.</P>
<P>Upon the whole of this Head, if there are &s;uch things as principles of analogy, if the rules which critici&s;m has e&s;tabli&s;hed for
<PB N="90" REF="91">
judging of the age of a poem, are beyond the caprice of conjecture, then are the TRA|GEDY OF ELLA, and the BATTLE OF HASTINGS, modern compo&s;itions: if they are antient, then are the elegancies of Gibbon's &s;tyle coeval with the deplorable pro&s;e of Caxton.</P>
<P N="6">VI. COMPARISON OF CHATTERTON'S POEMS WITH THE POEMS ATTRIBUTED TO ROWLEY. It has been urged, and for an obvious rea&s;on, that the poems acknow|ledged by Chatterton to be of his own com|po&s;ition, are of a ca&s;t much inferiour to tho&s;e which he produced as written by Rowley. If this be True, we &s;hould remember, that Chatterton lavi&s;hed all his powers on the counterfeit Rowley, with whom he intended to a&s;toni&s;h or to deceive the world, and that his Mi&s;cellanies were the temporary progeny of indigence, inconvenience, and di&s;traction. That the former pieces, were compo&s;ed, with one uniform object in view, in a &s;tate of lei&s;ure and repo&s;e, through the cour&s;e of nearly one year and a half; and the latter, amid&s;t the want of common nece&s;&s;aries, in di&s;quietude and in di&s;&s;ipation, at the call of book&s;ellers, and often on occa&s;ional topics, within four months. But I do not grant
<PB N="91" REF="92">
this boa&s;ted inequality. If there is any, at lea&s;t the &s;ame hand appears in both. The mi&s;cellanies contain many &s;trokes of uncom|mon &s;pirit and imagination, and &s;uch as would mark any boy of &s;eventeen for a genius. Let me add, that both collections contain, an imagery of the &s;ame &s;ort. Mr. Walpole ob&s;erves, with his u&s;ual elegant originality of &s;tyle and &s;entiment, that Chatterton and the &s;uppo&s;ed Rowley
<Q>&startq;were animated by &s;o congenial a &s;pirit, that the compo&s;itions of the one can hardly, very hardly, be di&s;criminated from the other.&mdash; The &s;ame &s;oul animates all, and the limbs that would remain to Rowley would in|deed, be <HI>disjecti membra poetae</HI>. Rowley would not only have written with a &s;pirit by many centuries po&s;terior to that of his age, but his mantle e&s;caping the hands of all his cotemporaries and &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, mu&s;t have been pre&s;erved nothing the wor&s;e for time, and re&s;erved to inve&s;t Chatterton &endq;from head to foot <NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">LETTER, ut &s;upr. p. 6.</NOTE>.</Q></P>

In the mean time, it is never recollected, at lea&s;t it is never acknowledged, that in Row|ley, although he does not &s;uffer our attention to flag, there are many flimzy lines, many puerile pa&s;&s;ages, examples of want of judge|ment, and &s;trokes of a young compo&s;er.

<P>But we are taught implicitly to believe, that there are no in&s;tances of fal&s;e ta&s;te, and of the bloated &s;ublime, in Rowley. Even in the mid&s;t of pathos, he is frequently de&s;criptive and ornamental. In the Pa&s;torals, his di&s;|tre&s;&s;ed &s;hepherds do not, as the Dean of Exeter apprehends, complain quite in the &s;tile of the Mantuan &s;hepherds, deprived of their lands by Augu&s;tus; but &s;ay, as I have be|fore ob&s;erved to another purpo&s;e, that Eng|land wears a bloody dre&s;s, and &s;tains her face with the gore of her champions, and that Confu&s;ion &s;ails through air in bloody gar|ments. One of them, as we have &s;een, clo&s;es his bitter complaint with this very unpathetic and unpa&s;toral idea, which flowed from Chatterton's attachment to antient manners, that

And on the &s;ame principles, many of the ab&s;urdities in Chat|terton's mi&s;cellanies might be defended. In the mean time, in proving that Rowley has his faults as well as Chatterton, I am not con&s;cious that I have exaggerated matters, by an unfair di&s;play of the wor&s;t pa&s;&s;ages. My opponents have certainly done this, in their attempt to expo&s;e the imperfections of Chat|terton's acknowledged poetry, and of its inferiority to Rowley <NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">I mu&s;t here ob&s;erve, that Mr. Bryant has contra&s;ted the fir&s;t twenty lines of Chatterton's CONSULIAD, with a pa&s;&s;age taken, as he &s;ays, from a poem called the CONSULTATION, written by one of Chatterton's intimate friends, and of the &s;ame age. The contra&s;t is intended to &s;hew, how much Chatterton was outdone by one of his young friends on a &s;imilar &s;ubject. OBSERVATIONS, p. 491. &s;eq. But, as I am informed by Mr. Steevens, the lines quoted by Mr. Bryant from the CONSULTATION, are &s;tolen, with little alteration, by Chatterton's friend, whoever he was, from the beginning of "PATRIOTISM, a Mock-heroic in &s;ix cantos," publi&s;hed in 1765, reprinted the next year, and written by Mr. Thomas Bentley, the critic's &s;on.

<P N="7"><PB N="97" REF="98">VII. MISCELLANEOUS OBSERVATIONS. In the&s;e poems there is no learning. I mean, Gothic Learning: &s;uch as the pedantry of a learned prie&s;t in the fifteenth century would have exhibited. There are no allu&s;ions or references to the cla&s;&s;ics of the dark ages. Our antient writers are perpetually &s;hewing the &s;mall &s;tock of knowledge which they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, by quoting the few authors, and tho&s;e of a particular ca&s;t, then in vogue. A &s;tudious eccle&s;ia&s;tic of this period would have given us a variety of u&s;ele&s;s authorities from Ari&s;totle, from Boethius and from the Fa|thers. Even allowing that the &s;uppo&s;ed Rowley was cultivated in literature beyond his times, we &s;ee no marks of a better learning. Had the writer of the&s;e poems ever known,

I think he would have cited or named, at lea&s;t &s;ome of the Latin poets.</P>
<P>In the&s;e poems we have no Religion. I do not mean that we have no recommenda|tions to virtue, or touches of morality. But they are not tinctured with a due &s;hare of what the French call <HI>onction</HI>. I mean, they have no prolix devotional epi&s;odes, &s;uch as would have naturally flowed from a writer of Rowley's profe&s;&s;ion and character. In&s;tead of addre&s;&s;es to the HOLY VIRGIN, we have long and laboured invocations to Truth, to Hope, to Content, and other divinities of the pagan creed, or rather of the creed of modern poetry. Rowley would have inter&s;per&s;ed his poetry with texts of &s;cripture. Lydgate, in the SIEGE of THEBES, quotes Saint Luke, to prove that avarice, ambition, and envy, are the primary cau&s;es of war. Had Rowley written the BALADE OF CHARITIE, in&s;tead of an ingenious apologue, enlivened with agreeable incidents and plea&s;ing de&s;criptions, he would have given us a tedious yet edifying homily in rhyme, not without frequent con|firmations of his doctrine from the Medita|tions of Saint Bernard, and from Saint Paul to the Corinthians. With all his poetry, he would never have made a ballad on charity &s;o poetical.</P>
<P><PB N="99" REF="100">We mi&s;s the marks of another &s;ort of reading in the&s;e poems, and which a real Rowley would have &s;hewn, I mean of old romances. To our old poets, the mo&s;t cele|brated atchievements and champions of the fabulous chivalry, the Round table with &s;ir Lancelot and &s;ir Tri&s;tram, and Charlemagne with his twelve peers, were the favourite and eternal topics of allu&s;ion. Particularly, to this &s;ort of allu&s;ion, a large field was naturally opened in the &s;ongs of the min&s;|trels, who accompany the li&s;ts in the Inter|lude of the TOURNAMENT. But in&s;tead of celebrating king Arthur, or any other di&s;tingui&s;hed chief of the romantic &s;tory, which the &s;ubject dictated, in one of the two odes, where they are called upon to &s;ing "&s;omme actyonn dyre of auntyante kynges," William the conquerour is de&s;cribed, poeti|cally enough, chacing the &s;tag in a dreary fore&s;t.

But perhaps Rowley, in the cour&s;e of his exten&s;ive Greek reading, borrowed the image, from whence Collins undoubt|edly took it, from Calli&s;tratus's beautiful Greek ode, or &s;colion, on Harmodius and Ari&s;togeiton, pre&s;erved by Athenaeus, DEIPNOS. xv.695. A. edit. Ca&s;aub.</NOTE>. In the fir&s;t of the&s;e, Chatterton was in his walk of antient Engli&s;h hi&s;tory. In

the &s;econd, his knowledge of modern imagery appears.</P>
<P>Had &s;uch a poet as Rowley exi&s;ted in the fifteenth century, he would have been idol|ized by his age, he would have been com|plimented by cotemporary writers, and his works would have been multiplied by nu|merous manu&s;cripts, which would have now been remaining in our libraries. He would have been printed by Caxton, who diligently &s;earched after all the poetry of his times, and would have de&s;cended in repeated edi|tions to po&s;terity. His life would have been written by Bale, who mentions ob&s;cure authors, now de&s;ervedly forgotten: and by the cla&s;&s;ical Leland, he would have been undoubtedly recorded, as the great and rare &s;cholar, who under&s;tood Greek in the reign of Edward the fourth. That this collection of poems &s;hould &s;ub&s;i&s;t in one copy only, and that un&s;een, unknown, nor ever once tran&s;cribed, for &s;o long a period, is incredible.

The ca&s;es are not quite parallel. The&s;e authors, once in vogue, &s;unk into ob|livion on the irre&s;i&s;tible de&s;truction of polite literature. When knowledge returned, they were re&s;tored and re&s;cued from neglect. He adds, that many manu&s;cripts of the <HI>&s;ame nature</HI>, lie concealed and di&s;regarded in our public libraries. None, I believe, of the &s;ame &s;pecies and importance. It is often a&s;ked, continues our &s;agacious critic, why Rowley is not mentioned by Bale or Leland. I tru&s;t, I have a&s;&s;igned the true rea&s;on. Tho&s;e biographers, he &s;ubjoins,

have not mentioned Robert of Glouce&s;ter: and why might they not have omitted Row|ley? But Robert of Glouce&s;ter was an ob&s;cure unpopular chronicler. They could not have been blind to the lu&s;tre of Rowley's name. Another cau&s;e is alleged, that there are &s;trong marks of party in the&s;e poems, and that therefore they were &s;uppre&s;&s;ed. It is indeed too true, that our author is &s;ometimes a Yorki&s;t and &s;ometimes a Lanca&s;trian. But we will &s;uppo&s;e that his Yorki&s;m predo|minated. He was therefore of cour&s;e pro|&s;cribed in the reign of Henry the &s;eventh. Why were not the works of the Lanca&s;trian Lydgate, the great and the perpetual panegyri&s;t of king Henry the &s;ixth, extermi|nated by Edward the fourth, or condemned to an inacce&s;&s;ible che&s;t &s;ecured by &s;ix locks?

<P>But let us attend to a few particulars, which have not yet been di&s;tinctly &s;tated, and properly dige&s;ted. Our charity-boy Chat|terton, in his tenth year began to hire books from a circulating library at Bri&s;tol. It is a &s;trong argument on the part of my hypo|the&s;is, that from his earlie&s;t age, he was &s;tudious to the mo&s;t uncommon degree. Between his eleventh and twelfth years, he wrote a catalogue of the books he had read to the number of &s;eventy. The u&s;her of the &s;chool, Mr. Thomas Philips, was <HI>&s;mit with the love of &s;acred &s;ong:</HI> and &s;ometimes re|laxed the duties of the mechanical penman, by writing poetry in the magazines. To this
<PB N="104" REF="105">
illicit practice he &s;educed &s;ome of his pupils: and by his example or encouragement, many of the &s;enior &s;cholars were ea&s;ily tempted to &s;trew the thorny paths of arithmetic with flowers, and to try their hands at ver&s;es. Chatterton was now almo&s;t twelve: and although not in the higher cla&s;&s;es, &s;eems to have &s;hared in the general emulation. Yet, as it appears, with privacy. His fir&s;t poetical production, when he was now aged only eleven years and five months, is a &s;atire on &s;ome methodi&s;t, &s;uch a one as it was ea&s;y to find at Bri&s;tol, and is entitled, THE APOSTATE WILL. It has a degree of humour, and an ea&s;e of ver&s;ification, which are a&s;toni&s;hing in &s;uch a child. About the &s;ame time, having now received confirmation from the bi&s;hop, a ceremony which &s;truck his imagination, and on which he made very &s;erious and &s;en&s;ible remarks, he wrote eighteen lines on the day of judgement, and paraphra&s;ed the ninth chapter of Job, and &s;ome chapters of I&s;aiah. We are told by his &s;i&s;ter, that
<Q>&startq;he had been <HI>gloomy</HI> from the time he began to learn, but we re|marked he was more <HI>chearful</HI> after he &endq;began to write poetry <NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">See Milles's ROWLEY, p. 9.</NOTE>.</Q></P>

<P>Mr. Bryant affirms, that Chatterton &s;hewed no parts at &s;chool, and acquaints us, that
<Q>&startq;the ma&s;ter of the &s;chool, Mr. Haynes, is &s;till alive, who &s;ays, that he was not a boy of extraordinary parts, nor did he make any di&s;play of abilities, during the time that he was at &s;chool, which was till &endq;he was fourteen and an half <NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">OBSERVATIONS, p. 560.</NOTE>.</Q> I have all due re&s;pect for the capability and veracity of Mr. Haynes, the worthy ma&s;ter of Col&s;ton's charity-&s;chool at Bri&s;tol. But for the &s;ame rea&s;on for which perhaps Mr. Haynes thought him a blockhead, I think him an in|genious boy. The teacher of arithmetic could not di&s;cern the future poet. Mr. Haynes's opinion reminds us of the dancing-ma&s;ter, who, when Lord Oxford was appointed fir&s;t
<PB N="106" REF="107">
Mini&s;ter to queen Anne, declared he wondered what her maje&s;ty could &s;ee in lord Oxford, for that when he had the honour of teaching his lord&s;hip to dance, he was the greate&s;t dunce at a minuet that he ever remembered.</P>
<P>What was &s;uppo&s;ed to be dullne&s;s in Chatterton was genius. The &s;ymptoms of talents were mi&s;con&s;trued by his cotempora|ries. They were di&s;gu&s;ted with his pride, which was a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of preeminence of abilities. Before he was five years old, he was the little tyrant of his playfellows, and the leader of the &s;port. Mr. Capel, now a jeweller of Bri&s;tol, a brother apprentice in the &s;ame hou&s;e with Chatterton, relates, that there was
<Q>&startq;generally a drearine&s;s in his look, and a wildne&s;s attended with a vi&s;ible con|&endq;tempt for others <NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Bryant, ut &s;upr. p. 525.</NOTE>.</Q>
The &s;ilence, the &s;oli|tude, of this vi&s;ionary boy, his eccentric habits, his &s;ingularities of behaviour, were not attributed to the true cau&s;e. His fits of melancholy were mi&s;taken for fullenne&s;s. His &s;i&s;ter &s;ays, that he was
<Q>&startq;&s;ometimes &s;o <HI>gloomed</HI>, that for many days together, he would &s;ay very little, and that by con|&endq;&s;traint.</Q>
An old female relation, who undoubtedly thought him mad, has reported,
<PB N="107" REF="108">
that
<Q>&startq;he talked very little, was very ab&s;ent in company, and u&s;ed very often to walk by the river-&s;ide, talking to him&s;elf, and &endq;flouri&s;hing his arms about <NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Croft's LOVE AND MADNESS, p. 148.</NOTE>.</Q>
He de&s;pi&s;ed di&s;cretion, a virtue allied to many meanne&s;&s;es, and in the place of worldly prudence, atten|tion to propo&s;als of economy, and a regular profe&s;&s;ion, &s;ub&s;tituted his anticipations of immortality. He &s;corned &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, but what his own poetry could alone confer <NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">I am informed from Mr. Cro&s;s, late an apothecary in Brook-&s;treet, Holbourn, where Chatterton lived and died for want of bread, that hardly a morning or evening pa&s;&s;ed but he would &s;tep into his &s;hop to chat. Mr. Cro&s;s &s;ays, that his conver&s;ation, a little infidelity excepted, was mo&s;t captivating: and that by the mo&s;t pre&s;&s;ing and repeated importunities he could never be per&s;uaded to accept of frequent invitations to dine or &s;up.

But, &s;ilent and un|&s;u&s;pected, he was now &s;oliciting the mu&s;e in &s;ecret. This apparent indifference was owing to the coyne&s;s or delicacy of genius, not always willing to di&s;cover it&s;elf; and avoiding the ob&s;ervation of others, not &s;o much from fear as from contempt. At the hours allotted to play, we are told that he con&s;tantly retired to read. This was the YOUNG EDWIN, who forged Rowley's poems.</P>
<P>It was owing to his pride, which has been con&s;trued into veracity, that he &s;o inflexibly per&s;i&s;ted to the la&s;t, that the&s;e poems were written by Rowley. To this &s;ecret of his bo&s;om he had vowed eternal fidelity, and there is a degree of heroi&s;m in his ob&s;tinacy. Although in a &s;tate of indigence, and a candidate for reputation, no per&s;ua&s;ion, no expectation of gain or of prai&s;e, no intere&s;t, could induce him to depart from his original declaration. When he perceived that the poems were treated as forgeries, and that he was traduced as a cheat, the &s;uperiority which he had always maintained was affected, and he became &s;till more determined in a&s;&s;ert|ing what he had once a&s;&s;erted. His vanity
<PB N="109" REF="110">
was piqued in an improper way. He thought it would be more to his di&s;advantage, to own than to &s;uppre&s;s the truth: he rather wi&s;hed to e&s;cape the character of fal&s;ehood, than to claim the merit of excellent poetry. He had formed golden dreams of the &s;ucce&s;s of this impo&s;ture. But finding that his forgeries were &s;u&s;pected, and that his hopes of profit were at an end, he would not avail him&s;elf of that fame which an open confe&s;&s;ion would have put into his power, and which now only remained to &s;upply the place of &s;olid emolu|ment <NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">I take this opportunity of rectifying a mi&s;information which appears in the HISTORY OF ENGLISH POETRY, ii.142. I have &s;aid, that Mr. Walpole's deci&s;ion on Rowley, was delivered to Chatterton after he came to town in 1770. This is not true. Chatterton, not yet removed from Bri&s;tol, and almo&s;t two years before, had received this opinion from Mr. Walpole, in a very kind and affectionate letter. Chatterton returned two peevi&s;h an&s;wers, and their corre&s;pon|dence cea&s;ed. Had Chatterton, when he came to town in 1770, done him&s;elf the honour to call on Mr. Walpole, I am confident that Mr. Walpole, although he &s;aw his forgeries, and was ju&s;tly di&s;gu&s;ted at the incivility of his letters, would have patroni&s;ed his genius in the mo&s;t liberal manner, and probably prevented his mi&s;erable end. Mr. Walpole never &s;aw Chatterton.</NOTE>. Critici&s;m, the companion and the a&s;&s;i&s;tant of truth, has endeavoured to replace

We are informed, that long be|fore he left &s;chool, he was devoted to &s;tudy; and that he borrowed from Mr. Long, Mr. Shiercliff, and particularly from Mr. Green, who had the large&s;t collection of any book|&s;eller in Bri&s;tol, and to whom he was indebt|ed for Speght's Chaucer, &s;uch books as their &s;hops produced <NOTE N="w" PLACE="foot">Milles's ROWLEY, p. 5.</NOTE>. From others he procured, Skinner, Ker&s;ey, and the &s;mall Saxon dictio|nary.

But the expre&s;&s;ion appears in a fragment of Occleve's Lamenta|tion on the Death of Chaucer, in a mi&s;cel|lany called the MUSES LIBRARY, printed in 1738, a book likely to be found in a Circulating Library, and to be borrowed by a reader of old poetry.</P>

<P>In this controver&s;y, deep learning has been mi&s;taken for general reading. Let us recollect, that in the pre&s;ent age, literary topics, even of the mo&s;t ab&s;tru&s;e and recondite na|ture, are communicated and even familiari&s;ed to all ranks and all ages, by Reviews, Magazines, Abridgements, Encyclopedes, and other works of a &s;imilar kind, which form the <HI>&s;chool of the people</HI>. But I will add an anecdote, never yet publi&s;hed, which &s;hews that Chatterton might have &s;een &s;ome books of greater variety and curio&s;ity. During his life-time, the Old Library at Bri&s;tol was of univer&s;al acce&s;s; and I am mo&s;t credibly informed, that he was introduced to it by Mr. Cattcott, a clergyman of Bri&s;tol, who wrote on the Deluge, the brother of Mr. George Catcott.</P>
<P>While he continued in the Attorney's office, he had &s;o little of his ma&s;ter's bu&s;ine&s;s to do, that &s;ometimes he was not detained for two hours in a day from his favourite object. And while he remained in this &s;ituation, he frequently &s;ate up all night, and
<PB N="112" REF="113">
wrote by moon-light <NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">His SISTER'S LETTER, Milles, ubi &s;upr. p. 11.</NOTE>. It has not been ob&s;erved, that his ma&s;ter's office might have &s;upplied blank &s;lips of refu&s;e or neglected parchment. To a penury of parchment it was certainly owing, that he wrote his lines of poetry like pro&s;e; a practice, antient in|deed, but &s;eldom u&s;ed, and totally di&s;con|tinued for at lea&s;t two hundred years before the age of Rowley, when parchment was become a cheap and a common commodity. Nece&s;&s;ity dictated this mode of writing to Chatterton, which might be wrong, but had the probability of being right. But I have &s;omething &s;till more &s;u&s;picious to &s;ay of Chatterton's parchments.</P>
<P>And here I mu&s;t own, I &s;hould have thought, that the dean of Exeter knew how to play a better game at whi&s;t than to &s;hew his cards to his adver&s;ary. He has however been &s;o very indulgent, as to exhibit a long and a well-atte&s;ted narrative, which amounts to this plain fact: that Chatterton practiced experiments to give the ink and the parch|ments, which he produced, the colour and appearance of antiquity. Yet he &s;oftens the matter by &s;aying, that
<Q>&startq;this account only proves that Chatterton was di&s;po&s;ed to
<PB N="113" REF="114">
&endq;exerci&s;e his inventive genius:</Q>
and that the&s;e experiments were by no means likely to an&s;wer the end propo&s;ed, and to produce the intended effect <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">See Milles's ROWLEY, p. 437.</NOTE>. But as this &s;tory is not told with all its circum&s;tances, I &s;hall here give it, from the &s;ame te&s;timony, with &s;ome ma|terial improvements or corrections, in the following unan&s;werable letter, written by Mr. Croft to Mr. Steevens, and lately commu|nicated.</P>

<P>As I cannot &s;pare time from my profe&s;&s;ion to enter any further into this di&s;pute, and as you inform me that Mr. Warton is going to publi&s;h &s;omething, I write this Letter, ac|cording to your de&s;ire, in an&s;wer to your's of ye&s;terday, re&s;pecting what long &s;ince I &s;aid to you of Mr. Ruddall; and it is perfectly at Mr. Warton's &s;ervice. But I mu&s;t de&s;ire he will print it exactly as I &s;end it you. When I have &s;poken for my&s;elf, he may draw his own arguments from my communication.</P>
<P>The left hand column is an extract from Dean Milles's quarto edition of Rowley's, i. e. of Chatterton's Poems, p. 436, 7. The right hand column is my account of the &s;ame bu&s;ine&s;s. In &s;ome material circum&s;tances he certainly errs.

concerning Chat|terton, was on the 23d of July, 1778. At that time I gave &s;omething to the Mother and Si&s;ter for their volun|tary communications to me. After I pub|li&s;hed LOVE AND MADNESS, I laid a larger plan for their benefit, which I hope &s;till to &s;ee carried into execution; and I de&s;|tined &s;omething more to the family of him who&s;e genius I &s;o much re&s;pected, though I well knew his fami|ly deemed me their enemy for endeavour|ing to prove him guil|ty of Forgery. Pre|vented from going to Bath, and con&s;equent|ly from giving what I had &s;et apart for this purpo&s;e, with my own Hands, I gladly &s;eized
<PB N="118" REF="119">
the liberty allowed me by a friend of Mr. Ruddall to beg this favour of him. On the 22nd of March, 1781, I wrote to Mr. Ruddall, to whom I was then a perfect &s;tranger, making u&s;e of his Friend's name, and enclo&s;ing a Draught to him or his order for ten pounds, reque&s;ting he would give the Money to Chatterton's Mother and Si&s;ter. On the 30th of the &s;ame Month, Mr. Ruddall called upon me in Lincoln's Inn; appear|ed, as I imagined, to lean to the &s;ide of this que&s;tion which I have ever thought to be the right; and told me, of his own ac|cord, what certain|ly agrees no more
<PB N="119" REF="120">
with the Dean's ac|count, than what I have already related agrees with the Dean's &s;aying that Mr. Rud|dall told this, <HI>in</HI> 1779, <HI>on the pro&s;pect of pro|curing a gratuity of ten Pounds for Chat|terton's Mother, from a Gentleman who came to Bri&s;tol in order to collect information con|cerning the Son's Hi&s;|tory</HI>.</P>
<P>If my Memory not only fails me now, but failed me the &s;ame day, and has failed me ever &s;ince, Mr. Ruddall will cor|rect me. To him I appeal, and by him I mu&s;t &s;ubmit to be corrected. But, on the 30th of March, 1781, he told me, AS I THINK, that <HI>he a&s;&s;i&s;t|ed Chatterton in di&s;|gui&s;ing</HI>

SEVERAL <HI>pieces of Parchment with the appearances of Age, ju&s;t before</HI><Q>&startq;the Ac|count of pa&s;&s;ing the &endq;Bridge</Q><HI>appeared in Farley's Journal; that, after they had made &s;everal experiments, Chatterton &s;aid</HI>,

<P>As this appeared to me the mo&s;t deci&s;ive evidence, I a&s;ked Mr. Ruddall's leave to make u&s;e of his name about it, which he granted me; and I made a Memorandum of it, the &s;ame day, at the di&s;tance of a few hours. But it is &s;till po&s;&s;ible my Memory might deceive me.

</LETTER>
<P><PB N="123" REF="124">I will not affront the common &s;en&s;e of my readers, by making many remarks on a tale which &s;peaks for it&s;elf. A man is brought to the bar for counterfeiting antient writings. An advocate for the pri&s;oner &s;hifts the ac|cu&s;ation, and contends, that he could not be guilty, becau&s;e it was impo&s;&s;ible that &s;uch methods as he practiced for making the counterfeit could &s;ucceed. The attempt mu&s;t not be confounded with the &s;ucce&s;s. The attempt is readily granted, and that alone is &s;ufficient for conviction. But Chatterton really did &s;ucceed in his decep|tion, and impo&s;ed on many of his friends by this artifice. And it is but a dangerous apology in favour of a forger, to &s;ay, that he was <HI>di&s;po&s;ed to exerci&s;e his inventive genius</HI>. That Chatterton <HI>plaid tricks</HI> according to doctor Milles's account, with a piece of parchment, and wrote on it in an old hand, is an anecdote which had better been &s;up|pre&s;&s;ed in a vindication of his veracity. But by Mr. Croft's Letter, from the atte&s;tation of the &s;ame very credible witne&s;s, it appears that Chatterton <HI>di&s;gui&s;ed</HI> SEVERAL <HI>pieces of parchment with the appearance of age</HI>. For what purpo&s;e?</P>
<P><PB N="124" REF="125">CONCLUSION. I could mention many other circum&s;tantial evidences relating to the proce&s;s and management of this forgery. But I do not wi&s;h to re&s;t my proof on evidences of this nature. It is not from the com|plexion of ink or of parchment, from the information of cotemporaries, the tales of relations, the recollection of apprentices, and the prejudices of friends, nor even from doom&s;day-book, pedigrees in the herald's office, armorial bearings, parliamentary rolls, inqui&s;itions, indentures, epi&s;copal regi&s;ters, epitaphs, tomb-&s;tones, and bra&s;s-plates, that this controver&s;y is to be finally and effectually adju&s;ted. Our arguments &s;hould be drawn from principles of ta&s;te, from analogical experiment, from a familiarity with antient poetry, and from the gradations of compo&s;i|tion. Such a proof, excluding all impo&s;ition, liable to no deception, and proceeding upon ab&s;tracted truth, will be the &s;ure&s;t demon&s;tra|tion. A man furni&s;hed with a ju&s;t portion of critical di&s;cernment, and in the mean time totally unacquainted with the hi&s;tory of the&s;e poems, is &s;ufficiently, perhaps mo&s;t properly, qualified, to judge of their authenticity. To &s;uch a per&s;on, unprepared and unprejudiced as he is by any previous intelligence, and a
<PB N="125" REF="126">
&s;tranger to facts, let the poems be &s;hewn. I can ea&s;ily conceive to which &s;ide of the que&s;tion he will encline. Nor will he after|wards &s;uffer his opinion to be influenced by reports. External arguments, &s;uch at lea&s;t as have hitherto appeared, may be u&s;eful, but they are not nece&s;&s;ary. They will hang out lights &s;ometimes fal&s;e, and frequently feeble. In the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, external arguments have &s;eldom &s;erved to any other purpo&s;e, than to embarra&s;s our rea&s;oning, to mi&s;lead the inqui&s;itive, and to amu&s;e the ignorant.</P>
