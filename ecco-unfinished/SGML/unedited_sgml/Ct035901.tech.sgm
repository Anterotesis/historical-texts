many, who call them&s;elves Philo&s;ophers, that live

cannot think that Marriage is at all incon&s;i&s;tent
<PB N="7" REF="9">
with true Philo&s;ophy.&mdash;A wi&s;e Man will re&s;olve to
live like the re&s;t of the World, with this only Dif|ference,
that he is neither a Slave to Pa&s;&s;ions nor
Events.&mdash;It is not becau&s;e I have a little Philo&s;o|phy,
but becau&s;e I am on the wrong Side of forty
Sir <HI>Charles,</HI> that I de&s;ire to be excu&s;ed <HI>(&s;miling).</HI></P>

Collar your&s;elf&mdash;Ha! ha! ha!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HEARTLY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Quite the contrary, Sir; I have taken her &s;ome
time from the Boarding School, and brought her
home, in order to di&s;po&s;e of her worthily, with
her own Inclination.</P>

that particular Care to you, when &s;he had reached
a certain Age.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>HEARTLY.</SPEAKER>
<P>He did &s;o&mdash;and I am the more de&s;irous to obey
him &s;crupulou&s;ly in this Circum&s;tance, as &s;he will
be a mo&s;t valuable Acqui&s;ition to the Per&s;on who
&s;hall gain her&mdash;for, not to mention her Fortune,
which is the lea&s;t Con&s;ideration, her Sentiments are
worthy her Birth; &s;he is gentle, mode&s;t, and
obliging.&mdash;In a Word, my Friend, I never &s;aw
Youth more amiable or di&s;creet,&mdash;but perhaps I am
a little partial to her.</P>
