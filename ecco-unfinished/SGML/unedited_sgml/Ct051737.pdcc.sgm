<PB N="35" REF="35">the haughty airs of matrimony. I have all the &s;weets of wedlock without any of the bitters. All ro&s;es without thorns.&mdash;A wife! damn it, mine was in&s;upportable. I was forced to part with her. So domineering, &s;uch a vixen, and &s;o co&s;tly, &s;he would have ruined me. Now this girl checks me when I would give her any thing. She refu&s;ed a &s;ervice of plate that I offered her to-day. She &s;aid it was too expen&s;ive. Now I never indeed proffer'd to give my wife &s;uch a thing; but if I had, &s;he would have took it, yes, yes, yes, &s;he wou'd have taken it.</P>

Now this girl is as mild as a lamb, tender as a turtle, and no more haughti|ne&s;s in her than in a milk-maid. I never did a better thing than parting from Lady Nervous. And, I am certain that married men of fa&s;hion will never live happy, until they have &s;en&s;e and &s;pirit enough to make their wives live upon the board wages of a &s;eparate maintenance.</P>
