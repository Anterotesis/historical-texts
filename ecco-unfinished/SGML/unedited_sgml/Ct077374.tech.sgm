<P>IT is not to be wonder'd
that Merit &s;o exalted as
yours draws the Addre&s;|&s;es
as well as the Admiration
of the World: That which is
only &s;ingular is, that I have
attempted publickly to tell,
what all privately acknow|ledge,
Your extraordinary Ac|compli&s;hment
in tho&s;e Vertues
which claim the Admiration
of all &s;uch as are qualify'd
for Judges of what is Ex-Excellent:
<PB REF="3">
So &s;olid an Under|&s;tanding,
&s;o refin'd a Conver|&s;ation,
&s;uch Wit and Fire
in the Divertive Part, &s;o
much Rea&s;on in the Seri|ous,
&s;o many undeniable Acts
of Genero&s;ity, back'd by &s;o con|&s;iderable
a Fortune as yours,
gives us a ju&s;t Expectation
that Time will produce Some|thing
greater than has as yet
appear'd to the World.</P>
<P>A Capacity &s;o exten&s;ive as
Yours, fits you for all things
that you can but think wor|thy
of your Care; &s;ince what|ever
you were plea&s;ed to un|dertake,
you were always cer|tain
to &s;ucceed in, and of be|coming
entire Ma&s;ter of the
Subject you e&s;pous'd.</P>
<P><PB REF="4">
This Capacity of Mind, that
fits you for a Judge of all
Things, brings before you the&s;e
following <HI>Memoirs,</HI> Written by
that Ingenious and de&s;ervedly
Admir'd Lady who was Au|thor
of <HI>The Travels into</HI> Spain,
and of <HI>The Memoirs of the
Court of</HI> Spain. The Reputation
the&s;e <HI>Memoirs</HI> have in &s;everal
Editions gain'd abroad, made
us hope they would not meet
with a wor&s;e Reception here;
&s;ince tho' originally of our own
Growth, yet tran&s;planted by
a foreign Hand, and one &s;o
Excellent, made me not im|probably
conceive Thoughts of
Succe&s;s from the warm Sun|&s;hine
of the Court of <HI>France.</HI>
The Letters at the latter
end, are part of a Parcel that
was taken, as the Title &s;ays,
from an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Lady in her
<PB REF="5">
Pa&s;&s;age to <HI>Holland:</HI> The Of|ficer,
of whom I purchac'd 'em,
told me, that they were &s;how'd
him by a Privateer Captain,
who de&s;ir'd him to let him
know what they were. The
Exchange happening immedi|ately
after, the <HI>French-Man</HI>
not remembring to ask for 'em,
they remain'd with him. I
ju&s;tly thought 'em &s;o ea&s;ie, &s;o
natural and entertaining, that
knowing none to be offended
by them, I quickly re&s;olv'd
them for the Pre&s;s: But the
Tran&s;lation of the <HI>Memoirs</HI>
&s;welling to a larger Bulk than
was imagin'd, gives me no room
to in&s;ert here the mo&s;t beau|tiful
part of them, which is
deferr'd till the next Term,
when they will be printed in
a &s;mall Volume by them&s;elves.
And now, Sir, I hope for the
<PB REF="6">
Merit of the Offering you will
forgive the Offerer; who&s;e
highe&s;t Ambition is to plea&s;e
one on whom Nature and For|tune
have agreed to be&s;tow
their mo&s;t darling Favours.</P>

<HEAD>PART I.</HEAD>
<OPENER>Dear Cou&s;in,</OPENER>
<P>THe Time I &s;pent in <HI>London,</HI> and the
Intimacy I had with the Dutche&s;s of
<HI>Richmond,</HI> and my Lady <HI>H</HI>&mdash;, fur|ni&s;h'd
me with the Opportunity of being ac|qainted
with the mo&s;t agreeable Adventures,
and private Intreagues of the Court of <HI>Eng|land.</HI></P>
<P>The Dutche&s;s of <HI>Richmond</HI> (who was the
Duke of <HI>Buckingham</HI>'s Si&s;ter, and by Mar|riage
nearly related to the King,) was ex|tremely
Beautiful, and of a Mien and Pre&s;ence
very Noble and Maje&s;tic. My Lady <HI>H&mdash;</HI> was
Si&s;ter in Law to the late Dutche&s;s of&mdash;, by
her Marriage with the Lord <HI>H&mdash;,</HI> now Earl
of <HI>R&mdash;</HI> &s;econd Son of the Lord Chancellor
of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>You, who are not unacquainted with the
Dutche&s;s of <HI>Mazarine,</HI> mu&s;t allow her to have
<PB N="2" REF="8">
Charms, that render her the mo&s;t agreeable
of her Sex, which made her Hou&s;e the Ren|dezvous
of all the Men of Wit and Quality,
and the Scene of all the News of the Town,
of Gaming, Entertainments, and all manner
of Diver&s;ions.</P>
<P>Mon&s;icur St. <HI>Evremont</HI> was plea&s;ed to con|tinue
to me that Friend&s;hip he had for my Fa|ther,
and I having often &s;een the Dukes of
<HI>Monmouth</HI> and <HI>Buckingham,</HI> the Earl of St. <HI>Al|bans,</HI>
and the Lord <HI>C&mdash;</HI> at my Hou&s;e in <HI>Paris,</HI>
introduc'd me into their Acquaintance;
Mon&s;ieur <HI>Barrillon</HI> our Amba&s;&s;ador was one
of my Friends, and <HI>Don Ped$o Ronquillo</HI> the
<HI>Span$&s;h</HI> Amba&s;&s;ador, and Count <HI>de Thun</HI>
the Emperor's Envoy paid me their Vi&s;its.
The Acquaintance of &s;o many Per&s;ons of Di|&s;tinction
gave me opportunity of knowing
a thou&s;and diverting Stories, of which I have
compo&s;ed the&s;e <HI>Memoirs,</HI> and, according
to your De&s;ire, put them into as regular
a Method as I could. I have concealed &s;ome
of the Ladies Names I was oblig'd to menti|on,
being unwilling to injure them while I
have nam'd others, hoping what I &s;peak in
their Favour, will counterballance what the
Malice of their Enemies &s;hould &s;ay again&s;t
them.</P>
<P>'Tis impo&s;&s;ible to know the Duke of <HI>Mon|mouth,</HI>
and not to allow him the Character
which his Perfections challenge from all his
Acquaintance: He was very hand&s;ome,
extreamly well made, and had an Air of
Greatne&s;s an&s;werable to his Birth; he was
brave, even to a Fault, and expos'd him&s;elf
<PB N="3" REF="9">
in the Service abroad, with a Courage not to
be excelled: As no Man had better Natural
Qualifications, &s;o care was taken in his Edu|cation
to give him all tho&s;e that were to be
acquir'd by Art: He danc'd extreamly well,
and with an Air that charm'd all that &s;aw him:
His Heart was always divided between Love
and Glory: He had in &s;hort all the Accom|pli&s;hments
of a fine Gentleman: But it mu&s;t
be allow'd that they were allay'd with too
much Ambition, which Pa&s;&s;ion engaged him
in an unhappy Undertaking, that brought
him to an End too untimely and unfortunate.</P>
<P>It is no wonder he was &s;o much addicted
to Love, being the Son of <HI>Charles</HI> the 2d.
This Prince had many Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es, yet none
whom he &s;o tenderly lov'd as Madam <HI>Barlow,</HI>
Mother to the Duke of <HI>Monmouth;</HI> &s;he was &s;o
perfect a Beauty, and &s;o charm'd and tran|&s;ported
the King when he fir&s;t &s;aw her in
<HI>Wales,</HI> that amid&s;t the Misfortunes which
di&s;turbed the fir&s;t Years of his Life and
Reign, he enjoy'd no Satisfaction or Plea|&s;ure
but in loving and being beloved by this
charming Mi&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>The Equipage he allowed her, the Care he
took to plea&s;e her, and the Complai&s;ance he
had for her were &s;o exceedingly great, (this
being his fir&s;t Pa&s;&s;ion, and he being in the
Bloom of his Youth, a time when the Heart
throughly po&s;&s;e&s;t with the Power of Love at|tempts
every thing it is capable of for the Per|&s;on
beloved) made the World believe he had
promi&s;ed her Marriage. This Error &s;o agree|ably
flattered the Vanity of the Duke of <HI>Mon|mouth,</HI>
<PB N="4" REF="10">
that tho' he was &s;atisfy'd there was
nothing of Truth in the matter, yet he act|ed
as if he was fully a&s;&s;ur'd of its Reality;
and there were not a few who &s;ooth'd him
in this mi&s;take: And this &s;urmi&s;e, joyn'd
with the tenderne&s;s the King expre&s;s'd for
him, &s;et a particular di&s;tinction betwixt him
and tho&s;e other young Noblemen the King of
<HI>England</HI> had own'd.</P>
<P>The Per&s;onal Advantages of the Duke,
and the King's Favour, drew after him &s;o
great a <HI>Levee,</HI> that the Pre&s;umptive Heir of
the Crown could not be treated with more
deference or re&s;pect: He po&s;&s;e&s;s'd the be&s;t
Places in the Government; was Rich, Young,
Gallant, and (as I have already &s;aid) the
Hand&s;ome&s;t and be&s;t Shap'd of Men. It will
not after this appear &s;trange, that many La|dies
made it their bu&s;ine&s;s to engage his
Heart; this good fortune he was &s;en&s;ible of,
and knew how to make u&s;e of it, but never
had &s;o delicate a ta&s;te of Love to be &s;trongly
engag'd to any one in particular; he was inca|pable
of confining him&s;elf to one Intreague,
there being hardly a day in which he got not
a new Mi&s;tre&s;s; and there appear'd more
Affectation and Vanity, than Love or Since|rity,
in all his Intriegues.</P>
<P>The King thought it proper to fix him,
and pitch'd upon the Daughter of the Duke
of <HI>Buclei$gh</HI> and Counte&s;s of <HI>Wembs,</HI> for his
Wife. She was the greate&s;t Fortune in the
Kingdom of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and had all that was to
be wi&s;h'd for to make her agreeable; &s;he had
Virtue, Wit, Riches, and Birth, and tho'
<PB N="5" REF="11">
&s;he was not extraordinary Beautiful, and a
little Lame, yet in the main &s;he was very de|&s;irable.
Perhaps had the Duke been oblig'd
to have been at the trouble of this Conque&s;t,
and had he undergone the Fatigues of Love
and won her by his Merit and A&s;&s;iduity,
he had e&s;teem'd him&s;elf happy in obtain|ing
her, but receiving her from the King,
without the expence of a &s;igh or a tear, that
which ought to have been his Felicity, pro|ved
his greate&s;t Inquietude.</P>
<P>He imagin'd his Liberty to be taken from
him, and that he &s;hould be oblig'd to keep
&s;uch mea&s;ures with a Wife the King had im|po&s;ed
upon him, that if ever &s;he &s;hould have
any cau&s;e of complaint again&s;t him, the King
would always be Judge, and would not fail
to decide it in her favour: In &s;hort, he had
little inclination for the Yoke, <HI>Hymen</HI> had laid
on him, and he obey'd only in &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to,
and for fear of di&s;plea&s;ing the King his Fa|ther.
Marriages of this kind are not al|ways
happy. The Duke thought it &s;uffici|ent
to keep a fair Corre&s;pondence with his
Wife, and as &s;he had a great deal of Wit,
and could ea&s;ily di&s;cover her Husband's In|clinations,
&s;o hers became le&s;s vehement,
and &s;he contented her&s;elf, for her part, to
do her Duty, without being at the expence
of a fruitle&s;s tenderne&s;s.</P>
<P>The Duke being weary of this Confine|ment,
re&s;olved to deliver him&s;elf, by giving
his Heart entirely up to Love; and the Per|&s;on
he fixt on for this purpo&s;e, was one of
the Maids of Honour to the Dutche&s;s of <HI>Y&mdash;,</HI>
<PB N="6" REF="12">
who&s;e Youth and Beauty were equally char|ming;
&s;he had a Wit and Humour &s;o &s;pright|ly
and engaging, that the Duke would have
been unwilling &s;he &s;hould have cho&s;e any
other Ma&s;ter but him&s;elf, to have taught her
the Art of Love. The name of her Family
being of no u&s;e, I &s;hall content my &s;elf with
calling her <HI>Emilia.</HI> The Duke lo&s;t no op|portunity
of &s;eeing and entertaining her,
but it was but &s;eldom, by rea&s;on the Gover|ne&s;s
of the Maids of Honour often interrupted
them, becau&s;e &s;he knew him a dangerous
Per&s;on to her Sex.</P>
<P><HI>One day this watchful Guardian being con|fin'd,
by an indi&s;po&s;ition, from attending
the Dutche&s;s of&mdash;, who was to take the
plea&s;ure of the Evening on the</HI> Thames, <HI>the
Duke of</HI> Monmouth <HI>would not let &s;lip this fa|vourable
occa&s;ion of conver&s;ing with</HI> Emilia;
<HI>and when every one in her Highne&s;s's Barge
had &s;eated them&s;elves, he plac'd him&s;elf near</HI>
Emilia, <HI>and, full of confu&s;ion, &s;aid to her,</HI>
I cannot <HI>(Madam)</HI> be content with my De&s;tiny;
you will not love me! and I know you do not hate
the Earl of <HI>A&mdash;n.</HI> My Lord, <HI>(reply'd &s;he,
blu&s;hing)</HI> tho&s;e who pretend to give your Grace
this Information, have little acquaintance with
my Affairs. The Earl of <HI>A&mdash;n</HI> thinks not of
me, I know, he has a Mi&s;tre&s;s who de&s;erves and
takes up all his Heart; and I could a&s;&s;ure you,
were I capable of preferring one of your Sex before
another, my heart would determine in your fa|vour.
What you tell me <HI>(reply'd the Duke)</HI>
would comfort me, could I be contented with a
Compliment; but I expect &s;omething more &s;olid,
<PB N="7" REF="13">
Ha! <HI>cry'd &s;he, briskly,</HI> what more can you
de&s;ire? I de&s;ire <HI>&s;aid he, with a grave Air,</HI>
that you would Love me; can you give too much
in return of a Pa&s;&s;ion &s;o violent as mine? Yes,
<HI>reply'd &s;he,</HI> it is too much; and you are to
blame to ask it; and I were much more if I &s;hould
con&s;ent to your indi&s;creet De&s;ire.</P>
<P>She &s;poke this with &s;uch a Grace, and
with &s;o much Sweetne&s;s, that notwith&s;tand|ing
the Dutche&s;s of <HI>M&mdash;</HI> was in the
&s;ame Barge, engag'd at play with her High|ne&s;s,
he could not forbear &s;eizing the hand
of <HI>Emilia,</HI> and ki&s;&s;ing it with an exqui&s;ite
Tran&s;port. The Dutche&s;s perceiv'd it, and
tho' her love was not &s;o great as to cau&s;e a
Jealou&s;ie, yet &s;he found he had too much
Pa&s;&s;ion for another, and too little Con&s;idera|tion
for her.</P>
<P>Her vexation at this &s;ight made her Eyes
&s;parkle with anger, which added to their
Lu&s;tre; but the Duke was &s;o taken up with
<HI>Emilia,</HI> that he minded not his Wife.</P>
<P>The Earl of <HI>A&mdash;n,</HI> with &s;everal other
Per&s;ons of Quality who attended her High|ne&s;s,
followed in another Barge, and notwith|&s;tanding
the care he took to hide his unea&s;i|ne&s;s,
it was impo&s;&s;ible for him to remove his
Eyes from the Barge where the Duke and
<HI>Emilia</HI> were: He lov'd her entirely, but
conceal'd his Pa&s;&s;ion, becau&s;e of the particu|lar
Engagements he had with my Lady&mdash;.
This Lady was of the fir&s;t Quality, and made
u&s;e of it &s;o much in his favour, that with|out
the &s;hare of Beauty and agreeable Wit
&s;he was Mi&s;tre&s;s of, the Obligations &s;he laid
<PB N="8" REF="14">
on him were &s;ufficient to create Love: But
Alas! when a Lover is retain'd only by
Gratitude, he is &s;oon lo&s;t.</P>
<P>The Earl of <HI>A&mdash;n</HI> thought of nothing but
how to interrupt the Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI> and
<HI>Emilia</HI>'s Conver&s;ation. He had brought with
him a little Dog, well known to all the
Court; he took him in his Arms, and in
care&s;&s;ing him, let him fall into the <HI>Thames,</HI>
and pre&s;ently cry'd out for help to &s;ave his
Dog. All the Ladies were concern'd at it,
e&s;pecially my Lady&mdash;, who was in her
Highne&s;s's Barge, and who could not be in|different
in what &s;o much concern'd the
Earl.</P>
<P>One of the Watermen having &s;av'd the
Dog, my Lady&mdash;looking out on one &s;ide
of her Highne&s;s's Barge. <HI>Come, Come, my Lord,</HI>
(&s;aid &s;he) <HI>and congratulate with us the &s;aving
your faithful</HI> Melampus: <HI>Her Royal Highne&s;s's
gives you liberty.</HI> The Earl, who de&s;ir'd no
more but to get into her Highne&s;s's Barge,
pre&s;ently got in, and having fir&s;t paid his
Duty to her Highne&s;s, went and plac'd him|&s;elf
by my Lady&mdash;, But being &s;oon wea|ry
of his place, by making a fal&s;e Confident
of her, &s;eeks a pretence to remove.</P>
<P>Do you not &s;ee <HI>(&s;aid he)</HI> the Duke of <HI>Mon|mouth?</HI>
I have a great fancy to play him a trick.
And what wou'd you do, <HI>&s;aid &s;he?</HI> I will in|terrupt
the Conver&s;ation he has with <HI>Emilia;</HI>
and you will find it very diverting. You &s;eem
to take but little &s;atisfaction in my Company,
<HI>reply'd &s;he, with a melancholy look,</HI> &s;ince
you wou'd quit me for &s;o trivial matter Ha!
<PB N="9" REF="15">
Do you think it a matter &s;o trivial, <HI>&s;aid he,
all in confu&s;ion?</HI> Have you forgot Madam, a
thou&s;and little malicious Tricks he play'd us at
<HI>Hampton Court,</HI> and can we do too much in
return to puni&s;h them? You are <HI>(reply'd &s;he
coldly)</HI> more revengeful than me, or to &s;peak
plainer, I am not &s;o blind as you imagine; Go,
my Lord, <HI>(continu'd &s;he)</HI> go to <HI>Emilia:</HI> Your
de&s;ign of revenging your &s;elf of the Duke of <HI>Mon|mouth,</HI>
is not for what happen'd at <HI>Hampton-|Court</HI>
between him and us, but what rather hap|pens
now between him and <HI>Emilia;</HI> you look on
him as a Rival, and a very dangerous Rival too.</P>
<P><HI>You are too &s;u&s;picious, Madam,</HI> (cry'd the
Earl, forcing a tender look) <HI>you turn the mo&s;t
innocent things into a Crime, and you render
(Madam) the Chains of Love &s;o unea&s;y, by a
confinement &s;o di&s;agreeable, that it will be impo&s;|&s;ible
to pre&s;erve them long entire: Methinks you
ought to depend more on my Fidelity, than to
quarrel with me for a little Gallantry.</HI> My La|dy
&mdash;, who&s;e heart was full of anger and
jealou&s;ie, ro&s;e briskly without returning any
an&s;wer, but &s;he could not refrain Tears,
which &s;he conceal'd with her Handkerchief,
as if her No&s;e bled, and to di&s;gui&s;e it the
better, with her hand &s;he threw a little wa|ter
on her Face.</P>
<P>The condition &s;he was in, had not &s;o great
an effect on the Earl of <HI>A&mdash;n</HI> as to hinder
his fir&s;t de&s;ign, but going towards <HI>Emilia,</HI>
and bowing, <HI>Am I not a trouble&s;om Intruder,
Madam,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>and will you not wi&s;h me
the &s;ame misfortune of</HI> Melampus? <HI>All the La|dies
had the goodne&s;s to be concern'd at it, but
<PB N="10" REF="16">
you, Madam, you alone were in&s;en&s;ible of my un|ea&s;ine&s;s.
Great cau&s;e of complaint</HI> (&s;aid the
Duke of <HI>Monmouth,</HI> vex'd at this interrup|tion)
<HI>your Dog is faln in the water, and</HI> Emilia
<HI>did not &s;queak! You ought, my Lord, to have
been &s;atisfied at what my Lady&mdash;did.</HI> The
Earl would have return'd it after a man|ner
that might have produc'd a quar|rel,
had he not been with-held by many Con|&s;iderations;
for, reflecting he was in her
Highne&s;s's Barge, and that he had to do
with the Son and Favorite of the King, he
check'd the fir&s;t motions of his Re&s;entment,
and forgot, that, as the Son of the Duke of
<HI>Ormond,</HI> Lord Lieutenant of <HI>Ireland,</HI> his Qua|lity
was of the fir&s;t Rank. <HI>Emilia is much
oblig'd to you,</HI> (reply'd the Earl to the Duke)
<HI>for giving your &s;elf the trouble of an&s;wering for
her, and the &s;atisfaction you di&s;cover at her indiffe|rence
for me. You quarrel with me,</HI> (interrup|ted
<HI>Emilia,</HI> &s;miling) <HI>more out of a Capritio than
Rea&s;on. 'Tis yet &s;ome comfort to me</HI> (reply'd
the Earl) <HI>that you judge my Re&s;entment &s;tronger
than my &V;nder&s;tanding and</HI>&mdash;Here he
was interrupted by my Lady&mdash;, who had
in vain expected his return to her, having had
made a thou&s;and Signs, of which he took no
notice: So that being unable to bear any lon|ger
his conver&s;ation with her Rival, &s;he cal|led
him to &s;hew him a Bracelet of Diamonds

you think it an ea&s;ie matter to deceive me?</P>
<P>That is what I never de&s;ign to do, <HI>(an&s;wer'd</HI>

mu&s;t declare to you, that you do not touch my
heart enough, to make me capable of deceiving
you. <HI>The Duke thought this an&s;wer &s;o rude
that he was confounded, and knew not at
fir&s;t what an&s;wer to return, but his Pa&s;&s;ion
&s;oon overcoming his Anger, he put on a

Emilia <HI>to him</HI> to di&s;trust your merit; in my
opinion, a Per&s;on who de&s;erves &s;o much as your
Grace, &s;hould always triumph over his Rivals,
and never fear them. You endeavour in vain,
fair <HI>Emilia, reply'd he,</HI> to re&s;tore my peace

there was &s;omething &s;o engaging in his Con|ver&s;ation,

<P>The Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI> going thro' the

the light of the Moon, a Woman alone, who
appear'd well made, and who to avoid him
went into another Walk. He was not &s;o

this unknown, with intention to &s;peak to
her as &s;oon as &s;he was farther advanc'd into
the Park; but &s;eeing a Man come up to her,
he then no longer doubted but it was a Ren|dezvous.
He drew nearer &s;oftly, and knew
the Cloaths, which were very rich, to be the
Dutche&s;s. Never was Man &s;o &s;urpriz'd, and
this ab&s;olutely de&s;troy'd the good Opinion
he always had of her; and &s;ince he was &s;a|tisfy'd
he was not ignorant of his Conduct,
he believ'd &s;he contriv'd this Revenge for his
Infidelity; he knew then that it was po&s;&s;ible
to be jealous without love; and had it been
in another place, the effects of his anger had
been more violent.</P>
<P>He li&s;ten'd with attention to their Con|ver&s;ation,

between</HI> Emilia <HI>and him, and with what Pa&s;&s;ion
he ki&s;s'd her hand, and the length of their Con|ver&s;ation,

of his Friend; his mind was at re&s;t on one
&s;ide, but on the other hand he was not with|out

might be occa&s;ioned by his Gallantries;

<P>He thought therefore it was his be&s;t way
to prevent his Maje&s;ty, and without &s;taying

(&s;ays he to the Duke) <HI>goes an unhappy Wo|man,

<P>Sir, <HI>(Reply'd the Duke)</HI> on the contrary,
I am come to inform your Maje&s;ty, that I this

know not; and I own to your Maje&s;ty, I had re|veng'd
my &s;elf upon the &s;pot, had not my ju&s;t $$|&s;entment

<P>While he was &s;aying this, the Duke of
<HI>Gra$ton</HI> came to whi&s;per the King, and let him
know, that the Dutche&s;s of&mdash;be|&s;eech'd
him to grant her a private Audience.
This Duke was yet but a Child, but not|with&s;tanding
perceiv'd by &s;ome words that
the Dutche&s;s let fall, that &s;he came to com|plain
to the King of the Conduct of her Hus|band.
He did not love the Duke of <HI>Mon|mouth,</HI>
tho' he was his Brother, for the Duke
of <HI>Monmouth</HI> de&s;pis'd all the King's Children,
and pretended to a great difference between
him&s;elf and them; this was a &s;ufficient Mo|tive
to exa&s;perate them again&s;t him, and upon
all occa&s;ion willingly to declare for the Party
that oppo&s;ed him. This Rea&s;on engaged the
young Duke of <HI>Grafton</HI> to pre&s;s the King
for this Audience with the Dutche&s;s of&mdash;.
The King ordering the Duke of
<HI>Monmouth</HI> to attend, went into his Clo&s;et,

her, &s;o contrary to his natural Good|ne&s;s

her confu&s;ion made her &s;eem guilty.
She neverthele&s;s was not long in recovering
her&s;elf from her &s;urpri&s;e, and thinking more
on her own Ju&s;tification than her Com|plaints,
prote&s;ting to his Maje&s;ty, that &s;he

about with a perplext and thoughtful Air.</HI>
Is it po&s;&s;ible <HI>(&s;aid the Duke of</HI> Buckingham)
that you &s;hould be &s;o &s;en&s;ibly mov'd at my Mis|fortunes?
Another <HI>(reply'd the Duke of</HI> Mon|mouth)
might perhaps on &s;uch an occa&s;ion impo&s;e
on you, but I cannot think of deceiving my be&s;t
Friend: No, <HI>(continu'd he,</HI> your Affliction does
<PB N="23" REF="29">
not at all concern me; for I am wholly taken up
with my own. Know <HI>(my Lord)</HI> that this
Counte&s;s who is &s;o very jealous of her Honour
and Reputation has &s;aid the &s;ame kind things
to me, &s;he expre&s;&s;ed to you; and I thought
her worthy of my Inclinations, but believed her
capable of Infidelity.</P>
<P><HI>The Duke of</HI> Buckingham <HI>was extremely
&s;urprized;</HI> What! <HI>(cry'd he)</HI> are we then Ri|vals?
Has this Woman Cunning and Fal&s;hood e|nough
to deceive us? It di&s;turbs me,
<HI>reply'd the Duke of</HI> Monmouth, but I am not
at all &s;urprized; for &s;inee &s;he may imagine that
we love others be&s;ide her, it does not appear &s;trange
to me that &s;he deceive us. You are too indulgent,
<HI>&s;aid the Duke of</HI> Buckingham, and undoubtedly
you love her much le&s;s than me, &s;ince you bear
with &s;o much Indifference what I cannot think on
but with Horror. I do my &s;elf Ju&s;tice, <HI>reply'd
the Duke of</HI> Monmouth, and I cannot believe
a Woman who merits the Pa&s;&s;ion a Gallant Man
has for her can patiently &s;uffer him to divide it,
and rob her of half her due. It may happen <HI>(in|terrupted
the Duke of</HI> Buckingham) that du|ring
the time of a long Amour one may &s;ometimes
make u&s;e of a favourable Opportunity when it
happens in ones way: But it is certain that the&s;e
little Treacheries are of no Con&s;equence, and that
one always returns to the Object beloved, a$
to ones only good. It is for this Rea&s;on
that no rea&s;onable Woman ought to be offended at
them. I thought <HI>(&s;aid the Duke of</HI> Monmouth)
that the Laws between them and $s $word$ to be
equal, and that the Priviledge we a&s;&s;u$e to our
&s;elves of engaging from time to time in new In|trigues
<PB N="24" REF="30">
o$ Condition to return at la&s;t to our fir&s;t
Amour, is a Trick we put upon them, which ne|ver
reli&s;hes well with them, and which they mu&s;t
certainly return to the purpo&s;e when they find occa|&s;ion.
You would infer then <HI>(reply'd briskly
the Duke of</HI> Buckingham) that the Counte&s;s of
&mdash;has done well in deceiving us, and that
we ought both to thank her for the Trouble
&s;he has taken about it. No, <HI>&s;aid the Duke of</HI>
Monmouth, I &s;hould not conclude in that manner,
for it di&s;tracts me to find my &s;elf fooled by a Per|&s;on
I e&s;teemed even more than I lov'd, and whom
I have lov'd &s;o long: But yet I cannot but think
&s;he would have been faithful to either of us, had
either of us been con&s;tant to her. Good God!
<HI>(&s;aid the D. of</HI> Buckingham) was I not con&s;tant, or
did I love any one but her? But yet I am &s;uch aweak
Fool, <HI>added he,</HI> that I cannot forbear being unea&s;y
for fear of any Misfortune that may happen to her.
Her Husband's Moderation appear'd to me more
&s;u&s;picious, and troubles me more than if he had
re&s;ented it in the mo&s;t violent manner. Come,
come, <HI>(replied the Duke of</HI> Monmouth) let
us endeavour to a&s;&s;i&s;t her, and not look upon one
another as Rivals. Alas! <HI>(cried the Duke of</HI>
Buckingham) what can we do in a Bu&s;ine&s;s of
this Nature? We &s;hall never &s;ee her more.</P>
<P><HI>They continued walking while they were
thus di&s;cour&s;ing, when the Duke of</HI> Monmouth
<HI>perceived &s;omething &s;hining on the Ground,
he went and took it up, and finding it to be
Tablets adorned with Diamonds, addre&s;&s;ed
him&s;elf to the Duke of</HI> Buckingham, Have you
not, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> a Curio&s;ity to &s;ee what the&s;e Tablets
contain? One mu&s;t be then <HI>(an&s;wered the D. of</HI>
<PB N="25" REF="31">
Buckingham) the mo&s;t carele&s;s and mo&s;t coquet of

and if I find any thing in them worth your
Knowledge, I promi&s;e to communicate it to you. I
de&s;ire nothing of you at pre&s;ent, <HI>reply'd the

the Duke of</HI> Monmouth, to begin in now; but to

D. of</HI> Buckingham <HI>thank'd him for his Com|plai&s;ance,

<P>Notwith&s;tanding the little Concern and
Carele&s;ne&s;s the Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI> ex|pre&s;&s;ed,
yet was he &s;en&s;ibly touch'd with the
Infidelity of the Counte&s;s of&mdash;He thought
him&s;elf the only Per&s;on belov'd, and in this
Opinion was &s;o well &s;atisfied with her, that
he found it no ea&s;y matter to bring him&s;elf to
a Belief of what had happened; he reflected
upon all her Charms, and never thought her
&s;o beautiful, as at this Moment; but the&s;e
Reflections made him only more &s;en&s;ible of
his lo&s;ing her: Yet as he was not apt (by his
natural Temper) to lay any thing to Heart,
he remember'd him&s;elf of the Tablets he had
found, hoping to find in them what might
either amu&s;e or divert him, he there read
the&s;e Word.</P>
<P>Do not upbraid your &s;elf with the &V;nea&s;ine&s;s
you have given me? And is it po&s;&s;ible, that after
having flattered me with a Preference &s;omewhat
particular, that you could take &s;uch Plea&s;ure in
entertaining the Duke of <HI>Monmouth,</HI> and even
<PB N="26" REF="32">
before my Face? Think not to excu&s;e your &s;elf by
telling me I at the &s;ame time was in Conver&s;ation
with my Lady&mdash;. You know the Ca&s;e is dif|ferent,
and that I am obliged to keep &s;ome mea|&s;ures
with her, when you for your part have no
Pretence for engaging my Rival. If you wi&s;h not
my Death, appoint where I may &s;ee and entertain
you in private.</P>
<P>The Duke &s;oon perceived the&s;e Tablets be|longed
to the Earl of <HI>A&mdash;n,</HI> and that the
Billet was directed to <HI>Emilia:</HI> But the fol|lowing
Lines writ under the fir&s;t, ab&s;olute|ly
confirm'd him.</P>
<P>Complain not of me, my Lord, when you have
no Rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect my Heart; if I had any Com|plai&s;ance
for the Duke of <HI>Monmouth,</HI> it was out
of a politick De&s;ign, in which I con&s;ulted mo&s;t
your Advantage: For I was willing to divert the
Su&s;picions of the jealous Lady&mdash;, and give
her &s;ome Rea&s;on to &s;urmi&s;e I preferred another be|fore
you. I cannot meet you till to Morrow Eve|ning,
and then in the Gallery at the end of the
Queen's Apartment I &s;hall expect you. Fail not.</P>
<P><HI>This Infidelity of</HI> Emilia <HI>almo&s;t di&s;tracted
the Duke of</HI> Monmouth; Was it not &s;ufficient,
<HI>&s;aid he,</HI> to know that the Counte&s;s of&mdash;lov'd
the D. of <HI>Buckingham,</HI> but mu&s;t I al&s;o at the &s;ame

him. <HI>He found in his Mind a thou&s;and De|&s;igns

<HI>This Night &s;eem'd to him to be dedicated

&s;he to her,</HI> I am undone; &s;uch an Accident has
happened to me this Evening, &s;o unlucky and &s;o

<HI>Buckingham:</HI> His Moderation and affected Calm|ne&s;s
threaten and foretell the w$r&s;t of Misfortunes.
Good God! <HI>added &s;he,</HI> What &s;hall I do to deli|ver
my &s;elf from them? You ought, Madam,
<HI>&s;aid</HI> E&s;ther, without deferring a moment, go to
your Si&s;ters, and by that means avoid the fir&s;t
motions of your Husband's Pa&s;&s;ion, which are al|always
the mo&s;t dangerous. But what Pretence,
<HI>&s;aid the Counte&s;s,</HI> can I make for going out &s;o
late? Would not that be confe&s;&s;ing a Crime, and
&s;hould I not be confounded and overwhelm'$ with
Shame? When danger is &s;o near, <HI>reply'd</HI> E&s;ther,
give me leave to tell you, one mu&s;t not be &s;o &s;cru|pulous.
Your Si&s;ter, Madam, will advi&s;e you, and
be as tender of your Reputation as of her own. But
what &s;hall I &s;ay to the Duke of <HI>Monmouth, re|ply'd
the Counte&s;s,</HI> when he comes to be ac|quainted
with what has happened? Will he not be
my greate&s;t Enemy? He never has loved you well
enough, Madam, <HI>an&s;wered</HI> E&s;ther, to hate you,
and if you continue longer the&s;e unnece&s;&s;ary Refle|ctions,
my Lord will return, and it will be then
too late to e&s;cape his Anger.</P>
<P>The Counte&s;s went from her Chamber to the
Stair-Ca&s;e, but as &s;he was de&s;cending, and ju&s;t
going into her Chair, her Husband appeared.
<PB N="28" REF="34">
She &s;eemed not at all confus'd, but told him
her Si&s;ter was not well, and had &s;ent to de|&s;ire
her to come to her. It did not appear
whether he believed her or not; he &s;eem'd
unconcerned, and only &s;aid it was too late
for her to range the Streets, and that an able
Phy&s;ician would comfort her Si&s;ter better;
and then with a Chagrene Look which &s;eem'd
to forbode Mi&s;chief, ordered her to re|turn
with him to her Chamber.</P>
<P>So &s;oon as &s;he was in her Chamber, he told
her the King had ordered him the next
Morning to go down into <HI>Pembroke&s;hire</HI> to
compo&s;e &s;ome Di&s;orders there, and that he
intended to take her down with him: It is
impo&s;&s;ible to expre&s;s the Surprize this cau&s;ed
in her; &s;he told him &s;he believed 'twas &s;ome
Ri&s;ing, and that &s;he &s;hould be always in Fears,
to be among di&s;affected Per&s;ons. He told her
he would &s;oon qualify all things. She added
it was yet too &s;oon, and too hot, to go
into the Country: He promi&s;ed to provide
cool Apartments for her. She an&s;wered, &s;he
&s;hould infallibly fall &s;ick; he reply'd, we have
good Phy&s;icians there. She &s;till in&s;i&s;ted how
much 'twould impair her Health: He de&s;ired
her not to trouble her &s;elf. And in fine, all
her Rea&s;ons were u&s;ele&s;s; he let her know,
that without troubling her &s;elf with more
eva&s;ions, it was his Plea&s;ure, and that it was
her Duty willingly to obey, becau&s;e he would
depart at break of Day.</P>
<P>Tho' the Duke of <HI>Buckingham</HI> was igno|rant
of this mi&s;chievous Determination, yet
was he no le&s;s unea&s;y and perplext at his
<PB N="29" REF="35">
Hou&s;e. He found his Wife on his coming
home in his Chamber where &s;he had &s;taid ex|pecting
him; &s;he flew into his Bo&s;om, and
throwing her Arms about his Neck, (which
added to his Chagreen) &s;he prote&s;ted &s;he
could not have &s;lept, had &s;he not &s;een him
before &s;he went to Bed; that &s;he was willing to
excu&s;e her &s;elf for what had happened
in his Maje&s;ty's Clo&s;et, and to own her
&s;elf in the wrong; but if he would
only con&s;ider the Cau&s;e of her Complaints,
it would incline him to love her more. He
agreed to whatever &s;he &s;aid, that &s;he might
the &s;ooner return to her Chamber: He told
her he feared her &s;itting up &s;o late would in|di&s;po&s;e
her, and that he was too much con|cern'd
for what might prejudice her Health
to &s;uffer it, and &s;o almo&s;t whether &s;he would
or no waited upon her to her Chamber. He
fancied him&s;elf quit of her, and was plea&s;ing
him&s;elf with this Imagination, when he per|ceived
her returning after him. One of her
Pages laying up a <HI>Hungary</HI> Water Bottle had
by chance let it fall by the Bed-&s;ide, and the
Smell of it was &s;o &s;trong,&mdash;or rather the
Dutche&s;s made this &s;o good a Pretence, that
&s;he came to de&s;ire the half of her Husband's
Bed, which he could not well refu&s;e her,
whatever Inclination he might have to the
contrary.</P>
<P>On the other hand, my Lady&mdash;, in go|ing
out of her Highne&s;s's Barge, not able
any longer to withold her Grief, &s;eign'd an

Tears &s;he had with &s;o much Trouble confin'd.
Shame and Anger to be &s;o much concern'd

<HI>Shall I not overcome this Pa&s;&s;ion,</HI> &s;aid &s;he,
to the Counte&s;s of <HI>F&mdash;,</HI> who was her in|timate

<P>The Earl of <HI>A&mdash;n,</HI> among all tho&s;e I

<P>The Amorous and Jealous Duke of <HI>Mon|mouth,</HI>

He went early to her Hou&s;e, and when he

Air, which made her appear &s;o ve|ry

My accu&s;ing him with loving <HI>Emilia,</HI> was, in his

&s;he dreaded al&s;o being &s;urpriz'd with him

<P>&startq;I cannot go into the Gallery without

you to let this matter take its natural cour&s;e.
Heav'n defend me, <HI>(cry'd the D. of</HI> Buckingham)
'tis &s;ufficient that &s;he de&s;ires my help, and I will
a&s;&s;i&s;t her. You intend then to turn Knight Er|rant,
<HI>(&s;aid the Duke of</HI> Monmouth?) I am
not &s;o Chymerical as that, <HI>interrupted the D. of</HI>
<PB N="35" REF="41">
Buckingham; but I cannot with patience &s;ee your
indifference for a Woman, who not four and
twenty hours ago you thought lov'd you. And then
I fear'd the contrary, <HI>reply'd the Duke of</HI>
Monmouth; my thoughts which have been &s;o
much deceiv'd in &s;o material Point, have work|ed
out their own cure.</P>
<P>I have been deceiv'd as well as you, and per|haps
more <HI>(reply'd the D. of</HI> Buckingham, <HI>&s;mi|ling)</HI>
but &s;he has &s;till an invincible Power over
me; whether it be genero&s;ity, or love, or both, I
cannot tell; I am re&s;olv'd to deliver her from the
hands of her Husband. You are going to make
a terrible di&s;turbance, <HI>reply'd the D. of</HI> Mon|mouth;
let me con&s;ider what is be&s;t to be done.
<HI>The D. of</HI> Buckingham <HI>return'd no an&s;wer&punc;
And the Duke of</HI> Monmouth <HI>after having
&s;ome time con&s;ider'd on ways and means the
mo&s;t practicable,</HI> No time is to be l$&s;t, <HI>&s;aid
the Duke of</HI> Monmouth; go my Lord, go, and
conjure the King to a&s;&s;i&s;t you; he is too Gallant,
and too Generous to refu&s;e you.</P>
<P>The D. of <HI>Buckingham</HI> approv'd of this expe|dient,
and went up directly to the King's Bed|chamber,
and de&s;ired a moments Audience.
As &s;oon as he was alone with the King, he
related to his Maje&s;ty the whole adventure
of the Rendezvous he had in the Park, the
misfortune of being &s;urpriz'd by the Earl of
&mdash;. He then &s;hew'd the Counte&s;s's Letter.
The King chang'd colour &s;everal times du|ring
this relation, and the Duke perceiving
it, was quite confounded, and began to fear
that he &s;hould find in the King a more dan|gerous
Rival, than in the Duke of <HI>Monmouth.</HI></P>
<P>After the King had for &s;ome time kept &s;i|lence,
<PB N="36" REF="42">
<HI>It &s;urpri&s;es me,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>that the Coun|te&s;s
of&mdash;&s;hould not have addre&s;&s;ed her &s;elf
to me, rather than to you, in de&s;iring protection
from the ill nature of her Husband; but &s;he has
her Rea&s;ons to conceal from me her Conduct and
Affairs.</HI> The D. of <HI>Buckingham</HI> having had
the honour of being brought up with the
King, had &s;o agreeably in&s;inuated him&s;elf
into his Maje&s;ty's Favour and Intriegues, that
he took a greater liberty of Speech in his
Conver&s;ation with the King, than any other
Per&s;on belonging to the Court.</P>
<P>Conceal not your thoughts from me, Sir, <HI>&s;aid
he to him;</HI> for I already penetrate into them, and
this contributes to make me compleatly mi&s;erable:
You love the Counte&s;s, and you are di&s;pleas'd and
jealous at our Rendezvous in the Park; but this is
a matter too important to permit of time to ex|amine
now, whether &s;he had rea&s;on or no of her
&s;ide. Stop her departure, Sir, and think only
of that. Oh! the Ingrate, <HI>(cry'd the King,
fetching a profound Sigh) he was then &s;ilent
for &s;ome time, and &s;eem'd to con&s;ider; af|ter
which,</HI> No, <HI>(continu'd he)</HI> &s;he de&s;erves
neither my Anger nor Protection: I'le have no|thing
more to do with her, nor will I have you
&s;peak any more of her. <HI>The Duke was amaz'd
and thunder-&s;truck; he perceiv'd the King
was entirely po&s;&s;e&s;t with a ju&s;t Indignation,
which would not &s;uffer him to be any ways
aiding or a&s;&s;i&s;ting to his Mi&s;tre&s;s; he there|fore
re&s;pectfully withdrew from his Maje&s;ty's
Clo&s;et.</HI></P>
<P><HI>He found the Duke of</HI> Monmouth, <HI>who
waited for him in the Guard-Chamber; he
pa&s;s'd by him, and took no notice of him,
<PB N="37" REF="43">
and went down Stairs: The Duke was &s;ur|priz'd
at this, but overtaking him, ask'd
him what he had concluded with the King?</HI>
I have made a new Blunder, <HI>(&s;aid he briskly
to him)</HI> and all by your Council; for you are
unlucky to me in my Intreagues: The King loves
the Counte&s;s, and I have acquainted him with
my Pa&s;&s;ion; imagine then how unfortunate I am.
La&s;t night I found you to be my Rival, and this
morning know the King to be &s;o too: And yet the
Infidelity and Treachery of my Mi&s;tre&s;s, is &s;o far
from allaying the violence of my Pa&s;&s;ion, that it
rather increa&s;es, and &s;eems as if I alone was de|&s;tin'd
to commit extravagances for a Woman,
that de&s;erves to be hated and de&s;pi&s;ed by me.</P>
<P><HI>As the Duke of</HI> Monmouth <HI>was prepar'd
to tell him, that we never lov'd more than
when we are in likelihood of being the ob|ject

the D. of</HI> Buckingham, perhaps the bu&s;ine&s;s the
King has &s;ent to me about may be for your advan|tage?
I &s;hall lo&s;e time, <HI>reply'd he,</HI> the Coun|te&s;s
is gone before this, and I mu&s;t follow her.
What! <HI>cry'd the Duke of</HI> Monmouth, would
you take her away by force! I know not what I
&s;hall do <HI>(added the D. of</HI> Buckingham) but fol|low
her I will. You are going upon an unadvis'd
and indi&s;creet Affair; <HI>interrupted the Duke
of</HI> Monmouth; refu&s;e not the &s;taying here for
me, and I will return in a moment. <HI>The D. of</HI>
Buckingham <HI>turning into a low and dark Gal+lery
which had &s;everal Apartments, belonging
to the Officers,</HI> here, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> I will expect you.</P>
<P>The Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI> ha&s;ten'd to the
King; he was inform'd he was in his
<PB N="38" REF="44">
Clo&s;et, he entred &s;oftly, and perceiv'd
his Maje&s;ty leaning on his Elbows, in a
thoughtful po&s;ture, who hearing &s;ome noi&s;e,
turn'd him&s;elf towards the Door and &s;aw the
Duke. <HI>Come hither</HI> James (for &s;o he often
call'd him) <HI>and an&s;wer me what I demand, with|out
he&s;itation; it is concerning the Counte&s;s of</HI>
&mdash;. The Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI> doubted not
but that his Maje&s;ty was appri&s;ed of the Pa&s;|&s;ion
he had for this Lady. <HI>Sir,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>you
demand of me an ingenious Confe&s;&s;ion of my In|clinations
for her: I owe too much re&s;pect to your
Maje&s;ty, not to be &s;incere: It is true therefore
that I have lov'd her, and &s;hould not I believe
have been hated, had I been more a&s;&s;iduous and
con&s;tant in my Addre&s;&s;es.</HI> The King was &s;ur|priz'd
at this unexpected Confe&s;&s;ion, and
looking gravely, <HI>Fini&s;h,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>what the
Duke of</HI> Buckingham <HI>has begun.</HI></P>
<P>The Duke found, but too late, his impru|dence
in an&s;wering the King, before he was
&s;atisfied what he intended to ask him; and
his thoughts were &s;o perplex'd and troubled,
and &s;o much di&s;order'd, that he had not
power to an&s;wer any thing.</P>
<P><HI>The King then breaking &s;ilen$e,</HI> I had
cho&s;e you for a Confident of my $word$, <HI>cry'd
he;</HI> I would have told you, that I had a Pa&s;|&s;ion
I was a&s;ham'd of, &s;ince no Lover ever was
more unfortunate than me; that I lov'd the
Counte&s;s of&mdash;with &s;o di&s;creet a Pa&s;&s;ion, that
having ob&s;erv'd her de&s;ires for having it an in|violable
Secret, I had taken all po&s;&s;ible care to
conceal my love, and was &s;atisfied in di&s;covering
only to her the violence of my Pa&s;&s;ion: I expected
that time would make me happy, in de&s;erving a
<PB N="39" REF="45">
Ble&s;&s;ing which I would have had owing only to my
care, and her acknowledgment. She cunningly
avoided giving me the lea&s;t encouragement, and
tho' my heart could but ill brook this u&s;age, yet
was it no &s;mall &s;atisfaction to me to find &s;o vir|tuous
a Woman. My E&s;teem encreas'd my Pa&s;|&s;ion;
but in truth, I have been the Bubble of
this Intreague; &s;ince you, and <HI>Buckingham</HI> have
triumph'd with &s;ucce&s;s; while I have langui&s;h'd
and &s;igh'd without complaint.</P>
<P><HI>The Duke of</HI> Monmouth <HI>having recover'd
him&s;elf, an&s;wered with a re&s;peful Look, that
the Affair he had with the Counte&s;s, ought
not to trouble his Maje&s;ty, &s;ince he
would never &s;ee her more.</HI> When one begins
to love the Son, <HI>interrupted the King,</HI> it is &s;el|dom
one returns to the Father; I &s;hould be much
in the wrong &s;hould I think it; and I must own
<HI>(continu'd he)</HI> I look on the D. of <HI>Buckingham</HI>
as a Rival much le&s;s to be feared; for we are near
of the &s;ame Age; but for you it is quite otherwi&s;e.
I know not, <HI>reply'd the Duke,</HI> what I might
have expected from the Counte&s;s; but I know
well, Sir, that it is a fortune I have long &s;ince
neglected. That is your fault, and not hers,
<HI>&s;aid the King;</HI> &s;he is not, in my opinion, either
more innocent or more excu&s;able; &s;he has decei|ved
me by a thou&s;and Artifi$es, neverthele&s;s I
pity her misfortune; for her Husband is going
to confine her in the Country. What will &s;he do
there? She will never get there three &s;uch Lovers
as &s;he leaves behind her at <HI>Whitehall.</HI> Go,
<HI>James,</HI> Go, I give you orders to &s;end the Guards
and bring her back, and acquaint her Husband,
that it is my Plea&s;ure he return, and that I have
occa&s;ion for him here.</P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="46">
The Duke immediatly left the King, well
pleas'd with his Commi&s;&s;ion, and went to
find out the D. of <HI>Buckingham</HI> in the Gal|lery,
where he expected him: He walk'd
&s;ome time without &s;eeing him, but at la&s;t
perceiv'd him &s;tooping and li&s;t'ning at a
Door. As &s;oon as he &s;aw the Duke of <HI>Mon|mouth,</HI>
he made a &s;ign to him to come to him
without making any noi&s;e; when he was
near enough, <HI>I know not,</HI> &s;aid he, (whi&s;per|ing)
<HI>whether I dream or am well awake, but I
&s;wear I hear the voice of our Counte&s;s. You are
&s;o full of her,</HI> reply'd the Duke of <HI>Monmouth,
that you believe you always hear her. I will be
judg'd by your &s;elf,</HI> added the Duke of <HI>Buck|ingham,
do but li&s;ten.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The Duke of</HI> Monmouth <HI>heard pre&s;ently a
Womans voice, which &s;aid,</HI> Alas! my Lord,

for I find my circum&s;tances more cruel and em|barra&s;s'd

from Hunting: In the mean time I will find out
&s;ome private and convenient Hou&s;e; after which
you may take &s;uch mea&s;ures as you think proper,
towards a reconciliation with your Husband. But
Madam, <HI>(added he, in a pa&s;&s;ionate Voice)</HI>
dare I ask you, what will become of me? will you
always u&s;e me with &s;o much rigour? and will not
the Service I have now done you, de&s;erve &s;ome|thing
from you?</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="47">
I am not in a condition to an&s;wer you, my Lord,

at a time I have &s;o much occa&s;ion for you; it
is detracting from your Genero&s;ity, and my Nicene&s;s.</P>
<P>Ah! Madam, <HI>&s;aid the Lord, (fetching a
deep &s;igh)</HI> the re&s;pect and love I have always &s;hewn
you, has been evident enough; but you have
&s;lighted my Pa&s;&s;ion; and notwith&s;tanding the
violence you have done your &s;elf in concealing
from me your Inclinations, yet have I penetrated
into them. But if at la&s;t you admit me to no
place in your favour, I &s;hall yet have the &s;ad com|fort
to &s;ay, have fail'd in nothing in re&s;pect to you.</P>
<P>He added &s;ome other words, which the
D. of <HI>Monmouth,</HI> and <HI>Buckingham</HI> could not
well hear, becau&s;e perceiving him to be ju&s;t
coming out, they had retired to the head
of a private Stairca&s;e, which belong'd to
my Lady <HI>F&mdash;l</HI>'s Apartments.</P>
<P>They might ea&s;ily from this place &s;ee who

could not forbear &s;aying to the D. of
<HI>Buckingham,</HI> (&s;miling) <HI>Behold another Rival;
but after what we have heard him &s;ay, I believe
he is not much to be fear'd.</HI></P>
<P><HI>He then gave the D. of</HI> Buckingham <HI>an ac|count
of his Conver&s;ation with the King,
and the order he had receiv'd for the bring|ing
back the Counte&s;s.</HI> Ah! my dear Friend,
<HI>&s;aid the D. of Buckingham,</HI> you may do me a mo&s;t
particular Service: You have the Key of the
Marque&s;s of&mdash;Chamber. It is true, <HI>reply'd
the Duke of</HI> Monmouth; being Captain of the
Guards, I have the Keys of the Chambers of both
<PB N="42" REF="48">
the Lieutenants, in ca&s;e of any Orders in the
Night, that I may the more readily go to them.
For God&s;ake, <HI>continu'd the D. of</HI> Buckingham,
lend it me, and I will take the advantage of this
moment to &s;ee the Counte&s;s. Should the King
know it, <HI>(&s;aid the Duke of</HI> Monmouth) it
would be &s;ufficient to make me lo&s;e his favour.
Who &s;hall acquaint him with it, <HI>interrupted the
D. of</HI> Buckingham? Should I betray you after
having $word$ &s;o much oblig'd to you! No, <HI>&s;aid
the Duke of</HI> Monmouth, it mu&s;t not be you, but
it may be my Lord&mdash;. He cannot divine,
<HI>(added the D. of</HI> Buckingham, <HI>&s;miling)</HI> and
otherwi&s;e cannot imagine that I &s;hould happen to
come in this moment into this Gallery, and that
you &s;hould there tru&s;t me with your Key. Nay,
he mu&s;t do more than divine, <HI>reply'd the Duke
of</HI> Monmouth, to imagine I &s;hould neglect mak|ing
u&s;e of this opportunity for my &s;elf, and to
grant it to you, when I know you to be my Rival.
Were you not well cured of this Pa&s;&s;ion, <HI>inter|rupted
the D. of</HI> Buckingham, I &s;hould rather
die than de&s;ire &s;uch a Sacrifice from you; but
from you your &s;elf; know the condition of your heart.</P>
<P>The Duke gave him the Key conditional|ly,
not to make u&s;e of it till the King was
gone a Hunting.</P>
<P>As &s;oon therefore as the D. of <HI>Buckingham</HI>
had &s;een the King take Hor&s;e, he ran to the
Gallery with the utmo&s;t Concern, a thou|&s;and
different Thoughts imploy'd his Mind;
he went to find out a Woman he tenderly
lov'd, but he was jealous of her, and even
almo&s;t hated her, when he reflected upon
the number of her Admirers, and that per|haps
&s;he had &s;acrific'd him to them. Taken
<PB N="43" REF="49">
up with the&s;e different Reflections, he ad|vanced
in the Gallery, &s;ometimes walking
&s;low, &s;ometimes fa&s;t; his Thoughts jarr'd,
and he was &s;trangely di&s;order'd.</P>
<P>The Dutche&s;s of <HI>B&mdash;</HI> having &s;pent part
of the Morning with the Counte&s;s of <HI>F&mdash;l,</HI>
de&s;cended the little Stairca&s;e coming into
the Gallery, and there perceiv'd her faith|le&s;s
Husband. She did not doubt, &s;ince he
followed not the King a Hunting, but he
had &s;ome Intreague, and &s;he therefore &s;topt
at the Door at the bottom of the Stair-ca&s;e.</P>
<P>She perceiv'd then, that he open'd the
Marque&s;s of&mdash;. Lodging, and went
into them: She following him &s;oftly, and
&s;topping fir&s;t at the Door, con&s;idering whe|ther
&s;he had be&s;t knock, ob&s;erv'd that it was
not quite &s;hut; well-pleas'd with this acci|dent,
&s;he &s;lipt into the Chamber.</P>
<P>The D. of <HI>Buckingham,</HI> taken up entirely
with his Pa&s;&s;ion, had forgot to take the Key
out $word$ the Door; the Windows of this lit|tle
Apartment were &s;hut, the Counte&s;s had
taken this precaution when &s;he enter'd, fea|ring
to be perceiv'd. There was a Clo&s;et on
one &s;ide of the Chamber; the Duke not &s;ee|ing
the Counte&s;s in the Chamber, went into
the Clo&s;et: The Dutche&s;s of <HI>B&mdash;</HI> not
knowing where to hide her&s;elf, laid her&s;elf
on the Bed, the Curtains being drawn: &s;he

given her.</P>
<P><HI>One could &s;ee better in the Clo&s;et than in

to conceal my retreat from you, as from my Hu&s;|band,
and wonder at the indi&s;cretion of my Lord
&mdash;, in di&s;covering it to you.</P>
<P>Were you le&s;s unfortunate, or had I le&s;s
zeal for you, Madam, <HI>reply'd the Duke of</HI>
Buckingham, I &s;hould have greater rea&s;on to
complain than you: I have neglected nothing on
this occa&s;ion that might be of peculiar Service. I
was ju&s;t ready to mount on Hor&s;eback to follow you,
and &s;natch you from your unworthy Husband, and
to expo&s;e my &s;elf to my Wives Jealou&s;ie, and
perhaps to the greatest Troubles, when chance
di&s;cover'd to me that you were in the&s;e Cham|bers.
Yes, faithle&s;s as you are, <HI>continu'd he,</HI>
&s;pight of my Rivals, and the care you take to

<P>I could not think, <HI>reply'd briskly the Coun|te&s;s,</HI>
that you would add new Afflictions to tho&s;e
which already overwhelm me, &s;ince 'tis you alone
have been the cau&s;e of this my deplorable Condi|tion.
Was there a Woman at Court had more
Reputation, or was le&s;s envied, till that unhappy A&s;|&s;ignation
in which I was di&s;cover'd with you?
'Tis for you I &s;uffer, and it is you In&s;ult over me!
Go, my Lord, go, I de&s;ire neither your heart nor
your pity, and your &s;ight is trouble&s;om to me.</P>
<P><HI>The Duke of</HI> Buckingham <HI>was too much

you will pardon me.</P>
<P>The unea&s;ine&s;s of the Counte&s;s of&mdash;

had taken in &s;peaking to her, &s;he believing
her Intreagues had not been di&s;cover'd, and
in&s;tead of appea&s;ing her, &s;he flew into &s;o great

<P>In &s;aying this, &s;he ran to the Chamber-Door,
which finding open, &s;he pre&s;ently

contriving which way to appea&s;e the
fury of his Mi&s;tre&s;s; after which he remo|ved
into the Chamber, where he believed
her to be, and hearing a noi&s;e towards the
Bed, he doubted not but &s;he was there, and
accordingly advanc'd towards her.</P>
<P>It was the Dutche&s;s of <HI>B&mdash;,</HI> who had
kept her&s;elf &s;till there, and who being as
much exa&s;perated as the Counte&s;s, thru&s;t
the Duke rudely from her, when he was
going to throw him&s;elf at her Feet, he &s;eiz'd
her Hands, and ki&s;s'd them &s;everal times
<PB N="46" REF="52">
with the utmo&s;t Tran&s;port; but the more
Pa&s;&s;ion he expre&s;s'd, the more was &s;he di&s;|pleas'd.
<HI>How unhappy am I,</HI> (&s;aid &s;he to her
&s;elf) <HI>that cannot deliver my &s;elf from this Traitor,
and that the tenderne&s;s he &s;hews, which at ano|ther

owe all this to my Rival, and the&s;e are poi&s;oned
Sweets which mortally offend a Heart &s;o delicate

<P>The&s;e Reflections encreas'd her Chagreen;
&s;he &s;natch'd her hands from the Duke, and
pu&s;hing him from her, would not mind him.
This u&s;age from a Per&s;on belov'd, encrea&s;es
rather than quells a Pa&s;&s;ion; and as &s;ubmi&s;|&s;ive
and re&s;pectful as the Duke was, he had
not quitted his de&s;ign of qualifying her an|ger,
had he not perceiv'd, that the Per&s;on
with whom he was had little dry and lean
Arms, which did not at agree with tho&s;e
of the Counte&s;s; it was not po&s;&s;ible to ima|gine
how afew hours grief could produce &s;uch
a &s;urpri&s;ing alteration: he was amaz'd at fir&s;t,
and going to the Window to open it, when
my Lord&mdash;return'd, in order to take
the Counte&s;s to a Hou&s;e of his own.</P>
<P>He was much &s;urpriz'd to find the Door
open, and pu&s;hing it &s;oftly, he thought he
had lo&s;t his Sen&s;es: Perceiving a Man with
a Woman, jealou&s;ie threw a mi&s;t befor his
Eyes, and notwith&s;tanding the difference
there was between the Dutche&s;s of&mdash;and
the Counte&s;s of&mdash;, he believed it was the
la&s;t, who rewarded his Services with this In|fidelity;
he was &s;o &s;truck with amazement,
that he had not the power of moving forwards
<PB N="47" REF="53">
the better to be confirm'd in what he &s;aw.</P>
<P>The Duke, for his part, perceiv'd by the
light that came from the Door my Lord
&mdash;open'd, that it was his Dutche&s;s with
whom he was; but the Dutche&s;s of&mdash;
more concern'd for him than her &s;elf, threw
her Arms about his Neck.</P>
<P>The Duke, not Ma&s;ter enough of his Pa&s;|&s;ion,
thru&s;t her di&s;dainfully from him. What
a Sight was this to my Lord&mdash;, who had
&s;taid at the Door! and who imagining it to
be the Counte&s;s had certainly made &s;ome Di|&s;turbance
had he con&s;ulted only his Fury and
Re&s;entment, but he was not willing this Af|fair
&s;hould make too great a Noi&s;e, or have
more Spectators.</P>
<P>He had time enough to ob&s;erve and know
the D. of <HI>Buckingham:</HI> He $word$ retired with
the greate&s;t Unea&s;ine&s;s imaginable, during
which the Dutche&s;s of&mdash;for her part
made a thou&s;and Reproaches to the Duke.</P>
<P>What! <HI>&s;aid &s;he to him,</HI> can neither my Fi|delity
nor Love obtain the lea&s;t Kindne&s;s from
you? Another po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es your Heart; and that
Heart which belongs to me, and which is the on|ly
Satisfaction of my Life, is continually engaging
it &s;elf in new Amours; and my unhappy Fortune
has brought me here to be witne&s;s of your Tran|&s;ports
for another, and of my own Di&s;grace. Ne|verthele&s;s
I love you with &s;o much Tenderne&s;s and
Complai&s;ance, and without any Con&s;ideration, that
I have the Weakne&s;s to concern my for you even
when you wrong me, and your Grief is more &s;en|&s;ible
to me than my own: Comfort me only with a
Look, or a Word: But what do I &s;ay? <HI>cry'd &s;he,
perceiving his Coldne&s;s)</HI> alas! you deny me all.</P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="54">
The Duke mov'd more by Acknowledge|ment
than Love, drew near unto her, and an|&s;wered
her Reproaches after &s;o &s;weet and in|&s;inuating
a manner that he a little calm'd her
Anger; and perceiving her Mind to be more
at ea&s;e and quiet, he left her, and went to
look after the Counte&s;s of&mdash;.</P>
<P>In going out of the Marquis of&mdash;
Chamber, the fir&s;t Per&s;on he met was the
Confident to the Counte&s;s of&mdash;. Heaven
has &s;ent you to help me, &s;aid he &s;topping
her, Tell me, Dear <HI>E&s;ther,</HI> where your Lady
is? I ask not the Secret, but to &s;erve her;
and to &s;hew the Affection I have for thee,
here is a Ring, which I mu&s;t oblige you to
accept of. This &s;taggered her Fidelity:
I do not doubt, my Lord, (&s;aid &s;he to him)
but you love my Lady well enough to endea|vour
at all Methods to deliver her from the
Troubles &s;he is in, but this is not a Place to
&s;peak to you without Danger. You have
put on your Mask to avoid being known.
Rea&s;on, &s;aid the Duke, follow me at a di&s;tance;</P>
<P>He was too impatient to put off this Con|ver&s;ation,
which would di&s;cover to him
what he wanted to know; and pa&s;&s;ing by the
Apartment of the Earl of <HI>C&mdash;,</HI> Great
Chamberlain to the Queen, and knowlng
that he was not there, he and <HI>E&s;ther</HI> went in.
After having carefully &s;hut the Door, this
Woman began to acquaint him with the Af|fliction
of her Lady, for having been found
by her Husband in an A&s;&s;ignation with you
in the Park: She then told him the Re&s;olu|tion
&s;he had taken of going to her Si&s;ter, and
after what manner her jealous Husband had
<PB N="49" REF="55">
&s;topt her, and his De&s;ign of carrying her
down into the Country; that not knowing
how to avoid this Misfortune &s;he had writ a
Note to him, which had been carry'd to the
King; but for fear of any unfore&s;een Acci|dent,
&s;he had al&s;o &s;ent to my Lord&mdash;to
conjure him to find out &s;ome way to hinder
her Journey into <HI>Pembroke&s;hire;</HI> that &s;he
grieved extreamly at the Uncertainty of
what might happen. Her Husband at break
of Day oblig'd her to depart; &s;he &s;ate di&s;|con&s;olate
in the Coach, looking every mo|ment,
and expecting &s;ome one to help her,
when my Lord&mdash;came in his Coach full
gallop, and in pa&s;&s;ing by us at one &s;hock
overturn'd us, and de&s;cending from his own
Coach came to a&s;&s;i&s;t my Lady, he drew her
out, and whi&s;per'd her to retire, and at the
Entry of the Wood &s;he would find a Coach
and a Gentleman who would conduct her to
<HI>Whitehall.</HI> She went directly into the
Wood: During this time the Earl of
&mdash;was endeavouring to come out of his
overturn'd Coach, and my Lord&mdash;to
hinder him made him a thou&s;and Compli|ments,
in asking Pardon for the Brutality of
his Coachman, and endeavoured all he could
to gain time. My Lord, I, and one of his
Gentlemen, were all one upon another,
without being able to get our Heads out of
the Coach, by rea&s;on of the long and conti|nual
Civilities of my Lord&mdash;, who could
not re&s;olve to leave us. But my Lord, in a
violent Pa&s;&s;ion, cry'd, <HI>Is it not enough that
you have overthrown my Coach, but would you
al&s;o &s;tifle me? If you de&s;ire it,</HI> an&s;wer'd my
Lord&mdash;coldly, <HI>I will turn off my Coachman
<PB N="50" REF="56">
and my Po&s;tilion; for there is nothing I would
not do to pre&s;erve the Honour of your Lord&s;hip's
Friend&s;hip.</HI> In ending the&s;e Words, which
had put my Lord quite out of Patience, he
went into his Coach, and we &s;et up ours.</P>
<P>'Tis impo&s;&s;ible to expre&s;s the Fury of our
jealous Husband, when turning round about
him, every where he mi&s;s'd his Wife; and
having ask'd his Servants, they &s;aid, they
knew nothing of her: He did not que&s;tion
in the lea&s;t but that &s;he had taken this Op|portunity
of giving him the &s;lip; but as he
had thought it mo&s;t proper to per&s;i&s;t in his
fir&s;t Re&s;olution of making no Noi&s;e or Di|&s;turbance,
he put a &s;erene Countenance upon
the matter, and with an audible Voice told
them, that without doubt &s;he was gone back
to <HI>London.</HI> We took the &s;ame way imme|diately,
and I found his Mind di&s;tracted with
a thou&s;and various Agitations. He was no
&s;ooner come home, but he &s;hut him&s;elf up in
his Clo&s;et, whil&s;t I laboured under a thou|&s;and
Inquietudes to know whither &s;he
was gone, till a Gentleman of the Counte&s;s
of <HI>F&mdash;</HI> came to tell me, that I mu&s;t come
to her thither. I went immediately, and
meeting with her in the Counte&s;s's Chamber,
&s;he told me part of what I have been rela|ting
ju&s;t now to you; and di&s;covered much
Unea&s;ine&s;s at the Di&s;charge of the Lord
&mdash;, who had promi&s;ed to return like|wi&s;e.
She bid me go and find him out;
which I did immediately; and becau&s;e I will
hide nothing from you, I mu&s;t tell you, I
found him in a mo&s;t cruel Pa&s;&s;ion. Go,
&s;aid he, go tell thy Mi&s;tre&s;s, &s;he is unwor|thy
of the Addre&s;&s;es of a Man of Honour.
<PB N="51" REF="57">
What has happened this Day will not be ea&s;i|ly
forgotten by me; and beg of her by all
means not to trouble me any more. I was
ju&s;t returning, continued <HI>E&s;ther,</HI> to bring
her this glorious An&s;wer when I met you.
The D. of <HI>Buckingham</HI> &s;ighed at the&s;e Words,
with all the Marks of Sadne&s;s and Affliction
in his Face; and how can it be imagin'd,
&s;aid he, my Lord&mdash;&s;hould not di&s;clo&s;e
more of this matter? His Pretence is, That
happening to open the Door of the Marquis
of&mdash;in the dark, he di&s;covered my Mi|&s;tre&s;s
&s;itting with a Gentleman upon the
Bed&s;ide, he turned back full of De&s;pair,
as imagining it could be no body el&s;e
but you. Alas! &s;aid the Duke, interrupting
her, it was I, but without being &s;o happy as
to be with her: Thou &s;ee&s;t, continued he,
the Frailty of my Heart for this ingrateful
Woman, for, Good God! what other Name
can I be&s;tow upon her: The King, the Duke
of <HI>Monmouth,</HI> and my Lord&mdash;are in
Love with her; &s;he entertains them, and
conceals it from me; for had &s;he no Inclina|tion
of be&s;towing &s;ome Favours upon them,
&s;he would have told me what I have learnt
from others. I have &s;everal times repre&s;ent|ed
to her, &s;aid <HI>E&s;ther,</HI> &s;he ought to impart
the matter to you: But &s;he feared to put you
into a Fit of Jealou&s;y; and I can prote&s;t to
you, that if &s;he has &s;hewn any more favoura|ble
Di&s;po&s;ition for the Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI>
than the re&s;t, you mu&s;t thank your &s;elf for
it, &s;ince &s;he had no other De&s;ign than to rai&s;e
a jealous Emulation in you. After your
falling out at <HI>Tunbridge,</HI> you know you were
<PB N="52" REF="58">
entirely reconciled together, and &s;he re|ceived
your Services with all po&s;&s;ible Ac|knowledgment
and E&s;teem, and the D. of <HI>Mon|mouth</HI>
(who had got another Mi&s;tre&s;s) being be|come
altogether indifferent to her, &s;he thought
&s;he had be&s;t not to mention any thing fur|ther
to you upon that &s;core. As to my Lord
&mdash;&s;he had &s;o much Indifferency for him,
that &s;he look'd upon him as next to nothing;
and the King him&s;elf with all his Greatne&s;s
could never obtain any Favours from her.
How dextrous thou be'&s;t, &s;aid the Duke in|terrupting
her, in endeavouring to alleviate
my Grief, and ju&s;tify thy Mi&s;tre&s;s! Go,
offer her all that is in my Power, tell her
that &s;ince I could love her, when I thought
her incon&s;tant, I can do every thing now I
flatter my &s;elf of not being hated. Come,
return, make ha&s;te to tell me; know what
cour&s;e &s;he intends to take. Whil&s;t the Duke
of <HI>Buckingham</HI> was at Supper in the Earl of
&mdash;Lodgings, he expected with much Im|patience
the return of <HI>E&s;t$er,</HI> but it grow|ing
late, he went him&s;elf to the Counte&s;s of
of <HI>F&mdash;</HI> to be inform'd in Per&s;on of what
he was &s;o de&s;irous to know. He found her
laid upon a Couch with a Handkerchief in
her Hand, and her Cheeks bathed with
Tears, <HI>O! my Lord,</HI> cry'd &s;he, &s;o &s;oon as
&s;he &s;aw him, <HI>you come too late; the poor Conn|te&s;s
of&mdash;is gone.</HI> The Duke &s;tood mute,
having no Power to &s;peak, and the Colour
of his Face chang'd &s;everal times; <HI>I am going,</HI>
continued &s;he, <HI>to relate to you the Con&s;equence
of the mo&s;t unfortunate Accident that ever hap|pened.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="53" REF="59">
Whil&s;t you were with <HI>E&s;ther,</HI> at the
Earl of&mdash;, where &s;he related to you &s;everal
material Pa&s;&s;ages relating to her Mi&s;tre&s;s, her
Husband was at the &s;ame time in the next Room,
overhearing every Word that pa&s;s'd betwixt you,
and con&s;equently is become Ma&s;ter of tho&s;e Secrets
he was ignorant of before. The King being in
his Wife's Intere&s;t, he has not thought &s;it to crave
his Protection, as he intended to do; but hauing
got Intelligence that after her coming out of the
Marque&s;s of&mdash;Lodgings &s;he came into mine,
he came and &s;urprized us together; <HI>E&s;ther</HI> co|ming
in at the &s;ame moment, he forced her to con|fe&s;s
in my Pre&s;ence every thing &s;he had told you
before; and then turning to his Wife, with a
Countenance full of Anger, Madam, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI>
there needs no further Con&s;ideration in the matter,
I am re&s;olved to take you with me, either by fair
or foul means, make the be&s;t or the wor&s;t of it,
as you find it mo&s;t convenient, and as may be
mo&s;t proper to keep up &s;ome remnants of your Re|putation:
Don't act your part &s;o much in publick.
I have &s;hown a great deal of Moderation, to con|ceal
both my Shame and Trouble, but if you &s;orce
me to publi&s;h it, remember you are lo&s;t for ever.
The Counte&s;s bur&s;ting out into Tears, look'd upon
me with a melancholly Air, and &s;o did I upon her,
without being able to advi&s;e her in the matter.
Her jealous Husband told her, that if &s;he did not
go along with him, he would break off with her
for good and all. To be &s;hort, after a great
many Heats and u&s;ele&s;s Prayers, &s;he told me &s;he
would rather &s;ubmit to any thing than to come
to an open Rupture with her Husband; and &s;o
&s;he went after him, with <HI>E&s;ther,</HI> but where he
intended to carry her I was not able to learn.</P>
<P>The Duke of <HI>Buckingham</HI> having kept Si|lence
<PB N="54" REF="60">
all this while, began now to break out
into the mo&s;t pa&s;&s;ionate Expre&s;&s;ions in the
World; <HI>Why, Madam,</HI> cry'd he, <HI>would you
not &s;end for me? Do you think that this unrea&s;on|able
Husband of hers ought to take her away again&s;t
her will? Before I would have &s;uffered &s;uch a thing
I would have lo&s;t my Life. 'Twas my Opinion,</HI>
reply'd the Counte&s;s of <HI>F&mdash;, I ought
to expo&s;e neither of you to &s;uch Hazards; you are
&s;o little Ma&s;ter of the fir&s;t Motions of your Pa&s;&s;ion,
that perhaps you might not have remember'd that
Place you were in; and tho' the King has a &s;ingu|lar
Kindne&s;s for you, yet you know that he will have
a due re&s;pect &s;hewn unto his Hou&s;$. Alas! Ma|dam,</HI>
&s;aid the Duke interrupting her very
ha&s;tily, <HI>is this the Re&s;pect to be &s;hewn to &s;uffer
a poor Woman to be taken away by a mad, furious
Husband? She &s;ought for &s;hel$er in your Arms,
and you had not Courage enough to keep her there,
nor to let me know of her Misfortune. But,</HI> con|tinued
he, <HI>what &s;ignifies trifling away the time
with vain Reproaches, we mu&s;t con&s;ider of means
for her Service.</HI> He was going away, but was
met by my Lord&mdash;upon the Stairs:
This Lord not able any longer to re&s;i&s;t his
Pa&s;&s;ion, in &s;pite of the indifferent Treatment
he had received at the Counte&s;s's Hands, and
at the Jealou&s;y conceived at the private Cor|re&s;pondence
he thought to have found out
betwixt her and the Duke of <HI>Buckingham,</HI> had
taken a Re&s;olution to &s;acrifice his Vexation
to his Love and Genero&s;ity; but was ex|tremely
&s;urprized at the Sight of the Duke;
for &s;eeing him coming out of the Counte&s;s of
<HI>F&mdash;</HI>'s Lodgings, he did not que&s;tion but
that the Counte&s;s of&mdash;had &s;ent for him
thither. He began again to upbraid him&s;elf
<PB N="55" REF="61">
with, and to be a&s;ham'd of his Weakne&s;s, and
&s;o with a firm Re&s;olution of vanqui&s;hing his
Pa&s;&s;ion, went away ha&s;tily.</P>
<P>Stay a moment, <HI>cry'd the Duke acco&s;ting
him,</HI> I know in &s;ome mea&s;ure what it is di&s;turbs
you; I am under an Obligation of ju&s;tifying to
you an unfortunate but guiltle&s;s Per&s;on; <HI>the$ re|lating
to him the Story told ju&s;t now, he con|tinued,</HI>
Perhaps looking upon me as your Rival
you judge me not a very proper In&s;trument to pro|cure
your Satisfaction, by ju&s;tifying the Conduct
of the Counte&s;s; but there is at pre&s;ent an ab&s;olute
Nece&s;&s;ity of uniting our &s;elves at this time, till the
Counte&s;s being put again into a State of an
entire Liberty to follow her own Inclinations, we
will manage our Preten&s;ions, every one at he best
can. Till then, let us act jointly in order to do her
effectual Service. <HI>If my Lord&mdash;had not
been inclined to what the D. of</HI> Buckingham
<HI>propo&s;ed, the la&s;t had &s;o happy a Gift of Na|ture,
of per&s;wading People to his Sentiments,
that few were able to with&s;tand him: My
Lord being fully convinced of the nece&s;&s;ity
of the ca&s;e, joined with his Rival to do all
po&s;&s;ible Service to their Mi&s;tre&s;s, carry'd a|way
by her jealous Husband with an Intention
to carry her to the</HI> $word$.</P>
<P>We will leave them for &s;ome time, and &s;ee
what became of the Duke of $word$. His
Mind had been (whil&s;t they were a hunting)
di&s;tracted with very different Fancies$; he
could not give him&s;elf a &s;ufficient Rea&s;on
why he &s;hould be &s;o &s;en&s;ible of the Infidelity
of the Counte&s;s of&mdash;, and of <HI>Emilia,</HI>
knowing that his Inclinations for them did
not amount to &s;uch a pitch, as to create ei|ther
Envy or Jealou&s;y in him, as it happens
<PB N="56" REF="62">
in violent Pa&s;&s;ions, and that con&s;equently be|ing
at Liberty to a&s;&s;ume new Chains, in ca&s;e
he could meet with any he liked better,
he neverthele&s;s &s;uffered the indifferent Treat|ment
of the&s;e Ladies; he concluded at
la&s;t that Vanity &s;ometimes produces the &s;ame
Effects as Love. Sometimes he would contrive
a way to be even with the Counte&s;s, &s;omtimes
what Reproaches to be&s;tow upon <HI>Emilia:</HI> He
felt a &s;ecret Plea&s;ure to think how his In|treagues
with this young Lady might take
vent at Court, and furni&s;h him with matter of
Revenge; but &s;oon after, repenting of this
Project, he was for keeping their Ap|pointment
private, in hopes that by his
obliging and engaging Words he might
rai&s;e &s;olid and &s;incere Love in her Heart.
The&s;e were his Amu&s;ements during the
Hunting-match. As for the Earl of <HI>A&mdash;n</HI> he
was extremely impatient to &s;ee <HI>Emilia,</HI> and
to have an opportunity of talking with her,
which was no ea&s;ie matter to do, con&s;i|dering
the Governe&s;s of the Maids of Ho|nour
afforded them but little lei&s;ure. As
this Lady was naturally of a jealous Di&s;po|&s;ition,
&s;o &s;he had found means to get intelli|gence
of the intended Interview betwixt the
Earl and <HI>Emilia,</HI> which &s;he re&s;olved to &s;poil
at any rate; be&s;ides con&s;idering, that if &s;he
could catch them together, &s;he would have
a fair pretence of Reprimanding her in the
mo&s;t bitter Terms that well could be: So
the &s;atisfaction &s;he propo&s;ed to her&s;elf, of
convincing this young Woman of her fault,
carrying it above all other Con&s;iderations,
which might have per&s;waded her to act with
more moderation, &s;he was &s;o far from keep|ing
<PB N="57" REF="63">
&s;o watchful an Eye over her, as &s;he u&s;ed
to do, that &s;he allow'd her more liberty
than ordinary. <HI>Emilia</HI> was ready enough
to improve it; &s;he pretended to go into her
Chamber to write, but &s;lipping down a pair
of private Stairs, got into another Room,
without being perceiv'd by any body. It
being a clear Moon-light Night, &s;he &s;hut
the Shutters, and then placed her&s;elf in one
corner of the Room, to avoid being &s;een, in
ca&s;e &s;ome body el&s;e &s;hould happen to come
that way.</P>
<P>The Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI> was too de&s;irous
to &s;ee her to let her tarry, but entred the
Room exactly at the appointed time; whil&s;t
<HI>Emilia,</HI> who feared le&s;s any body but the
Earl of <HI>A&mdash;n</HI> &s;hould come in, kept clo&s;e
in her Corner, hoping he would open the
Shutters and di&s;cover him&s;elf; but the Duke,
who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s was not to be &s;een, kept in
the dark, asking only with a low voice, <HI>are
you there? Pray an&s;wer me: Emilia,</HI> who did
not que&s;tion but that it was the Earl, an&s;wer|ed,
<HI>Yes I am.</HI> 'Tis hard to gue&s;s at the va|rious
motions this adventure rai&s;ed in the
Duke's Heart: He was overjoy'd at &s;o fa|vourable
an opportunity of entertaining this
young Lady, but almo&s;t di&s;tracted to think
that the appointment &s;hould not be of his
own making: He look'd upon it as inglori|ous,
to u&s;urp thus his Rival's place; and
more than once was in a mind to go away,
but at la&s;t drew nearer: She told him, <HI>Do you
&s;ee, my Lord, what I do for you, only to &s;peak
with you? Is not this &s;ufficient to convince you
that you have the preference in my Heart? and
hereafter I hope you will not torment me, on ac|count
<PB N="58" REF="64">
of the Duke of</HI> Monmouth. <HI>Is it po&s;&s;ible,</HI>
&s;aid he, (with a di&s;gui&s;ed Voice) <HI>that you can
Sacrifice him for me? and that you have no In|clinations
for him? I will Sacrifice him to you
with all my Heart,</HI> reply'd &s;he; <HI>but as I love to
deal upon Honour, I won't deny but that he ap|pears
worthy of Love to me. I have ob&s;erved,</HI>
&s;aid he, interrupting her, <HI>that he loves you,
and that he is very fond of telling you &s;o; nay
there appears a certain langui&s;hment in his Eyes,
when he is with you, which is not ob&s;ervable
in him, in the Company of other Ladies. I have
my &s;elf taken notice of that,</HI> added <HI>Emilia; I
believe I am not altogether indifferent to him. He
has made his brags,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>that you have pro|mi&s;ed
him a &s;hare in your Heart; and that if he
will continue to &s;$rve you, you would break off
with me. I am &s;urprized,</HI> replied &s;he, <HI>how he
dare$ to &s;ay &s;uch an untruth! And you are &s;ur|prized
thereat,</HI> (&s;aid the Duke, rea&s;&s;uming his
natural Voice) <HI>you are &s;urpriz'd, ungrateful
Woman? And you are come hither to &s;acrifice my
Pa&s;&s;ion, and your Oaths.</HI></P>
<P>Emilia <HI>di&s;covering him to be the Duke of</HI>
Monmouth, <HI>with &s;uch a commotion as is ea&s;y
to be imagined, &s;tood for &s;ome time like one
&s;truck dumb; and the Duke was going to
leave her, when &s;he &s;tept to him, and &s;aid,</HI>
Oh! my Lord, hear me one minute! I am a going
to tell what you will not di&s;like: 'Tis you alone I
Love, and you alone have all my E&s;teem. That
is plain, Madam, <HI>an&s;wered he,</HI> it appears &s;o;
you could have taken no better method to convince
me. What would you have me do, <HI>&s;aid &s;he, with
tears in her Eyes?</HI> I was no &s;ooner brought to
Court, but the Earl made his mo&s;t pa&s;&s;ionate Ad|dre&s;&s;es
to me, and quitted my Lady&mdash;, who
<PB N="59" REF="65">
lov'd him mo&s;t dearly. Seeing my vanity, and
my &s;elf thus flatter'd, by the preference given me
to &s;o lovely a Lady, my heart, then as yet in the
fir&s;t State of its Innocency, received with plea&s;ure
the &s;ighs of this new Lover, who I thought would
have Married me, after the Death of his Coun|te&s;s,
who had been very Ill for a con&s;iderable time.
Flattered with the&s;e hopes, I was the &s;ooner in|duced
to receive his Letters, and &s;end him &s;ome
of mine. Alas! I am di&s;clo&s;ing to you &s;uch mat|ters
as are much to my di&s;advantage, on purpo&s;e
to make you &s;en&s;ible at lea&s;t of this, that after be|ing
engaged &s;o far with a Per&s;on of &s;o little Mo|deration,
and of &s;o cholerick a Di&s;po&s;ition, I &s;aw
my &s;elf obliged, in &s;pight of my &s;elf, to tread in
the path I had &s;o imprudently cho&s;en. Would you,
my Lord, have me expo&s;ed to his ill Tongue? and
would you think me worthy of your Affection, af|ter
having lo&s;t my Reputation in the World?
<HI>The&s;e words being accompanied with tears,
the D. of</HI> Monmouth <HI>was actually per&s;waded
of her Innocency. He had lov'd her &s;ince her
Engagement with the Earl of</HI> A&mdash;n, <HI>and he
had too good an opinion of his own de&s;erts, as
not to believe him&s;elf to hold the be&s;t place
in her Heart beyond his Rival. His only care
was now how to maintain this favourable Di&s;|po&s;ition
in her. Whil&s;t they are taking
proper mea&s;ures for the continuing of their
Intreague, we mu&s;t &s;ee what pa&s;&s;es in the
Queen's Gallery, betwixt my Lady&mdash;
and the Earl of</HI> A&mdash;n. <HI>He was no &s;ooner re|turn'd
from Hunting with the King, but he
dre&s;s'd him&s;elf as nice as he could, to appear
the more amiable in the Eyes of his Mi&s;tre&s;s.
My Lady&mdash;on the other hand, the better
to counterfeit</HI> Emilia, <HI>who was then in Mour|ning,
<PB N="60" REF="66">
had dre&s;s'd her&s;elf in a Night Dre&s;s,
which almo&s;t cover'd her Face: Thus &s;he
entred the Gallery thro' a By-door, but the
Earl thro' the Queen's Apartment; there
being no other light but what proceeded
from the clearne&s;s of a bright &s;hining Moon.
My Lady&mdash;had po&s;ted her&s;elf in one Cor|ner;
the Earl drawing nearer, took her by
the Hands, and ki&s;s' them;</HI> Charming <HI>Emilia,
&s;aid he,</HI> 'tis at this time you di&s;pel all my Jea|lou&s;ie;
&s;o that now I &s;hould be di&s;tracted with the
very Thoughts of it, were it not an undeniable proof
of my Pa&s;&s;ion and Tenderne&s;s; for which you
ought to &s;tand indebted to me. <HI>Good God! what
&s;trange and cruel Emotions did the&s;e words
cau&s;e in my Lady&mdash;</HI>'s <HI>Heart, to &s;ee the on|ly
Man in the World, for whom &s;he had had
the greate&s;t Tenderne&s;s, to play her &s;uch a
Game? She had not &s;trength enough left to
return an an&s;wer; but the Earl being not
much &s;urpriz'd at her &s;ilence, continued,</HI> You
are afraid, fair <HI>Emilia,</HI> le&s;t this favour you have
done me &s;hould be di&s;covered; you &s;eem to be un|ea&s;ie,
you tremble; take courage, and don't re|fu&s;e
to give me &s;ome a&s;&s;urance of your Friend&s;hip.
Oh! what am I to tell you, <HI>reply'd my Lady&mdash;,
with a voice changed &s;o far by her &s;urprize,
as not to need any di&s;gui&s;e?</HI> what mu&s;t I tell
you, my Lord? I am not &s;o much affected with
the apprehen&s;ion of being found alone with you
here, tho' my All lays at &s;take, as with the dread
I have, that you are &s;till in Love with my Lady
&mdash;. I be in love with her, <HI>&s;aid the Earl!</HI> do
you think I have lo&s;t my Sen&s;es? Is there any com|pari&s;on
betwixt your Charms and hers? betwixt
a growing Pa&s;&s;ion, and one worn out before? be|twixt
a Woman continually out of humour with
<PB N="61" REF="67">
me, and a young Lady I adore? But my Lord,
<HI>&s;aid &s;he, interrupting him,</HI> you owe her a thou|&s;and
Obligations, you have &s;worn to be true to her
for ever, and if you can forget her &s;o &s;oon, what
mu&s;t I hope for from you? The Favours &s;he has
be&s;towed upon me, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> were more the pro|ducts
of her own Capriciou&s;ne&s;s than her choice;
'tis to chance I was obliged for her E&s;teem; and
notwith&s;tanding &s;he does not want wit, &s;he her&s;elf
can't give a good rea&s;on for it.</P>
<P><HI>At the&s;e words my Lady&mdash;, not able
to contain her&s;elf any longer,</HI> O! thou
mo&s;t perfidious of all Men, <HI>cry'd &s;he!</HI> Is
it not enough for you&punc; thus to forego your Duty,
but you mu&s;t al&s;o poi&s;on tho&s;e Favours for which
you &s;tand indebted to me by turning them into Ri|dicule,
and repre&s;enting them as the effects of a
capri$ious Folly? But after all, <HI>added &s;he,</HI> you
&s;peak truth; for I mu&s;t certainly be prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with
a mo&s;t extravagant Folly, when I heard and be|lieved
you. Are the&s;e the Products of your Cro|codil's
Tears, and of your reiterated Vows? Go
perjur'd Man, I leave you to your &s;elf, and the
Remor&s;es of your own Heart; I am &s;ufficiently
revenged, &s;ince I have Re&s;olution enough left to
tear you from my Heart. <HI>She had not put an
an end here to her ju&s;t Reproaches, when my
Lord &s;tanding all this while &s;o full of Confu|&s;ion
as not to be able to an&s;wer one Word;
and as the&s;e har&s;h Expre&s;&s;ions gave &s;ome ea&s;e
to her Mind, &s;he was going to continue her
Di&s;cour&s;e, had not a mo&s;t &s;urprizing Acci|dent
put a Period to their Conver&s;ation.</HI></P>
<P>This was occa&s;ioned by the coming in of
the Governe&s;s and Deputy-Governe&s;s of the
Ladys of Honour to the Dutche&s;s of&mdash;.
The&s;e having po&s;ted them&s;elves at the little
<PB N="62" REF="68">
Door of the Gallery, and &s;eeing her pa&s;s by
that way, took her for <HI>Emilia.</HI> Some time
after entring the Gallery, they fell upon her
like &s;o many Furies, whil&s;t the Earl of <HI>A&mdash;n</HI>
little concern'd at what might become
of her, took this opportunity of getting
away as fa&s;t as he could, but not without be|ing
vex'd to the Heart, to have met with &s;o
vexatious an Encounter, in&s;tead of the Satis|faction
he expected from the meeting with
<HI>Emilia:</HI> Amid&s;t all this he found &s;ome &s;ort
of Con&s;olation at the coming in of the&s;e two
Matrons, who did all they could to get my
Lady&mdash;out of the Corner, where &s;he &s;tood
upon the defen&s;ive, like in an Entrenchment,
and that &s;o courageou&s;ly (for fear of being
di&s;cover'd) that they could &s;carce come near
her; at la&s;t finding her Hands in&s;ufficient to
with&s;tand their furious Attacks, &s;he took hold
of the Earls Cane, which he had forgot to take
along with him when he left her, and laid them
on with it &s;o briskly, that they were forced
to have recour&s;e to their Clogs or Caloches,
(&s;uch as the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ladies then wore) which
after having &s;erved &s;ome time for defen&s;ive
Arms, at la&s;t turned into offen&s;ive ones, and
mo&s;t cruelly maul'd the poor Lady; who be|ginning
now to have much the wor&s;t of it,
began to be heartily weary of the Sport. At
that very Juncture the D. of <HI>Monmouth</HI> brought
thither by his Curio&s;ity to &s;ee the event of this
Night's Appointment, enter'd the Gallery,
attended by a Footman with a lighted Flam|beau
in his Hand. Had the Head of <HI>Medu&s;a</HI>
appear'd to them in&s;tead of the Flambeau, their
Surprize could not have been greater than it
was! The two Governe&s;&s;es &s;tood as immove|ble
<PB N="63" REF="69">
as two Statues at the &s;ight of my Lady&mdash;,
She on the other ha$$, was &s;o full of Affli|ction
at her being di&s;cover'd by the&s;e two
Matrons, as well as at her Conver&s;ation with
the Earl, that &s;he did not know what to do;
the Cane dropt out of her Hands, and at the
&s;ame time the Governe&s;&s;es threw away their
Caloches with great Indignation, muttering
betwixt their Teeth, that tho&s;e who had di|rected
them thither &s;hould repent of having
&s;ent them upon &s;uch an errand, and &s;o they
went their ways.</P>
<P><HI>They were no &s;ooner gone, but my Lady
&mdash;having order'd the Footman to keep at
a di&s;tance, and falling into a Chair, and look|ing
upon the D. of</HI> Monmouth <HI>with Eyes full of
Tears and Anger,</HI> O! my Lord, <HI>&s;aid &s;he &s;igh|ing,</HI>
how much is an agreeable Mi&s;take preferable
before a cruel Certainty? I now am convinced be|yond
all Contradiction, that the Earl loves <HI>Emilia,</HI>
that he is a perfidious Man, and that he deals
with me after &s;uch a manner as can never be par|doned
by me. Why are you di&s;&s;atisfied, Madam,
<HI>reply'd he,</HI> to be convinced in a matter you ought
to wi&s;h not to be ignorant of? Would it not vex
you to the Soul to pre&s;erve your Heart for an un|grateful
Per&s;on? And who has told you, <HI>return'd
&s;he abruptly,</HI> that I am &s;o indifferent as to be able
to bani&s;h at once from my Heart a Man who in|deed
de&s;erves to appear odious to me, $word$ who &s;till
&s;eems worthy to be beloved? My Rea&s;on tells me I
&s;hould hate him, but my Heart pleads for his Pardon;
this rebellious Heart of mine, &s;o little concerned
in the true Intere&s;ts of my Honour, will &s;till &s;peak
in $avour of a Man, who would not as much as af|ford
me one Sigh to appea&s;e my Anger. Had you but
&s;een, <HI>added &s;he,</HI> how quickly he got away, when the&s;e
<PB N="64" REF="70">
two old Croatures came in. You would have been
out of Countenance to &s;ee me in &s;o di&s;mal a Condi|tion.
<HI>At the&s;e Words her Tears flow'd down
all over her Cheeks and Face, which &s;he en|deavoured
to hide with her Fan; and &s;o ari|&s;ing
from her Seat, the Duke gave her his
Hand, and conducted her to her Lodgings.</HI></P>
<P>The Earl of <HI>A&mdash;n</HI> was involved in no
le&s;s Troubles of Mind, than her &s;elf; &s;o to
allay his Grief, he went to the Dutche&s;s's&mdash;
to find out <HI>Emilia,</HI> and to reproach her with
what &s;he had done; being fully per&s;waded
that no body but her&s;elf had contrived the
Meeting betwixt my Lady&mdash;, and him&s;elf
in the Gallery. Thus he went with an in|tention
to make her &s;en&s;ible how grievou&s;ly
he Re&s;ented the matter, but was no &s;ooner
come into the Guard Chamber, when he was
told there was no admittance at the Dutche&s;s's
&mdash;, &s;he being not well; if he was out of
humour in his being di&s;appointed of the &s;ight
of <HI>Emilia,</HI> he flattered him&s;elf, that this ac|cident
had prevented this young Lady from
coming abroad. A Lover never wants in|genuity
to excu&s;e his Beloved; he then be|gan
to imagine &s;he had no hand in this Ad|ventu$$
with my Lady&mdash;, and con&s;equently
his Re&s;entment was much allay'd.</P>
<P>In effect it was not from <HI>Emilia</HI> that the
Governe&s;s had got notice of this matter, but
from <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> one of her Companions,
who having found out that Secret, could not
keep it to her&s;elf, it being certain, that it was
not out of Jealou&s;ie only, &s;he had conceived
again&s;t <HI>Emilia,</HI> &s;he being as hand&s;ome as her
&s;elf, and having a greater &s;hare of Wit, and
what other Charms <HI>Emilia</HI> could boa&s;t of,
<HI>viz.</HI> a certain merry and innocent Air, which
was extremely plea&s;ing.</P>
<P><PB N="81" REF="71">
<HI>Philadelphia,</HI> as &s;he was &s;omewhat older,
&s;o &s;he acted with more Circum&s;pecti|on;
&s;he covered her Pa&s;&s;ion for the
Duke of <HI>Monmouth,</HI> under the Veil of
a langui&s;hing State of Health; and
under this di&s;gui&s;e penetrated into
the Sentiments and Actions of the Duke
of <HI>Monmouth,</HI> in re&s;pect to her Rival;
and finding him &s;ucce&s;sful with her, &s;he
fell into a deep Melancholy; As &s;he
had conceived a mortal Spite again&s;t
him, for loving another be&s;ides her
&s;elf, &s;he would often launch out into
har&s;h Expre&s;&s;ions, whil&s;t at the &s;ame
time her Heart declared in his behalf.
Moreover, the&s;e ways, &s;o directly op|po&s;ite
to the tenderne&s;s u&s;ual among
Lovers, &s;o far alienated the Duke of
<HI>Monmouth</HI>'s Heart, that he would &s;carce
ever come near her: This proving an
additional Grief to a Per&s;on of a haugh|ty
Temper, &s;he was con&s;umed by a
Fire &s;he was not able to quench,
&s;he turned her Spite again&s;t <HI>Emilia,</HI>
with a Re&s;olution to give her a Blow,
without telling her who it was that gave
it. <HI>Philadelphia</HI> had &s;hut her &s;elf up
all that Evening in her Chamber, on
purpo&s;e to reflect upon the Di&s;grace
that would attend <HI>Emilia,</HI> in being &s;ur|prized
with the E. of <HI>A&mdash;n</HI> whil&s;t &s;he
was expecting with much Impatience,
the return of the Governe&s;s, and De|puty-Governe&s;s,
when &s;he heard &s;ome|body
knock, and not very hard at her
<PB N="82" REF="72">
Door, &s;he open'd it. Great was her Sur|prize,
who when &s;he &s;aw the Governe&s;s
looking upon her with an au&s;tere Coun|tenace,
at the &s;ame time, ask'd her,
what Reward &s;he intended to be&s;tow
upon her News-bearers, and that &s;ince
by her Ra&s;hne&s;s &s;he had mi&s;led them in|to
a fooli&s;h Notion, &s;he was likely to
&s;tand the brunt of it. <HI>Philadelphia</HI>
&s;tood amazed, and tells them, that &s;he
had &s;een <HI>Emilia</HI> receiving a Billet from
the E. of <HI>A&mdash;n</HI> and that &s;tanding ju&s;t
behind her, &s;he could read both the
Letter, and her An&s;wer to it. Yes,
you have read very well, &s;aid the Go|verne&s;s,
witne&s;s what has pa&s;s'd ju&s;t
now. Whil&s;t they were di&s;puting the
matter, in comes <HI>Emilia,</HI> having ju&s;t
then left the Duke of <HI>Monmouth,</HI> who
having related to her in what manner
he had impo&s;ed upon the E. of <HI>A&mdash;n</HI> they
had diverted them&s;elves to his Co&s;t,
but &s;he little thought of the Recep|tion
&s;he was to meet with from the en|raged
Governe&s;s. They no &s;ooner &s;aw
her enter the Room, but both took
hold of her Arms, asking her three or
four times very abruptly, where &s;he
had been, and from whence &s;he came?
<HI>Emilia</HI> was much &s;urprized, imagining
&s;he had been over-heard, &s;he blu&s;h'd,
and her Eyes were $ixed on the Ground;
at la&s;t, after having pau&s;ed a while,
to con&s;ider what &s;he &s;hould &s;ay, &s;he
an&s;wered, From the Prince&s;s&mdash;They
<PB N="83" REF="73">
reply'd, &s;he mu&s;t tell them who was
there be&s;ides, and what had pa&s;s'd
there, or el&s;e they would immediately
go to find out the$ Truth. Seeing her
&s;elf touch'd to the quick by the&s;e home
Que&s;tions, &s;he told them briefly, That
Thanks to God, there was no &s;uch thing
as an Inqu&s;ition in <HI>England,</HI> and there|fore
&s;he did not think fit to an&s;wer all
their en&s;naring Que&s;tions, and if they
had a mind to know what pa$s'd at the
Prince&s;s&mdash;their be&s;t way was to go
thither to be inform'd. This haughty
An&s;wer, given by a young Woman
to the before exa&s;perated Governe&s;s,
was follow'd by a &s;evere Reprimand
from them, who told her, they would
give an Account of her Behaviour to
the Dutche&s;s of&mdash;But <HI>Emilia</HI> knowing
her at that time not to be in a Conditi|on
of hearkning to &s;uch like matters,
&s;tood it out couragiou&s;ly, and &s;he was
not in the wrong of it, for had &s;he ap|pear'd
more mild, it might have been
interpreted by her Enemies, to her
Di&s;advantage.</P>
<P><HI>In the mean while, my Lady&mdash;
had the wor&s;t Night of it &s;he ever &s;aw

by a Per&s;on whom &s;he was not
able to hate, and yet was reduc'd to
&s;uch a</HI> Nonplus, <HI>as to be oblig'd either

Ought not I fir&s;t to have con&s;ulted my own
Heart, before I undertook to convince this
ungrateful Man of his Infidelity? I &s;hould
have been &s;en&s;ible of all my Frailty. This
would have been a &s;ure way to prevent me
from making tho&s;e Steps to be &s;atisfy'd of
his Ingratitude. But now I am not in a Con|dition
to act at my own Plea&s;ure; he will
look upon me no otherwi&s;e, than upon an ir|reconcileable
Enemy, or as a Per&s;on again&s;t
which he has too much Odds, to fear her, or
perhaps he will be &s;o indifferent, as not to come
near me, or &s;ee me, unle&s;s it be to in&s;ult over
me. &V;nto what a mo&s;t cruel Extremity
have I been reduc'd, by the Advice of the

Duke of <HI>Monmouth. All her Servants
were gone to Bed, notwith&s;tanding
which &s;he call'd one of her Women,
and having order'd her to bring in
Candles, &s;he writ the&s;e Words:</HI></P>
<P>At la&s;t, my Lord, you receive the &s;ame
Treatment I did before. <HI>Emilia,</HI> your
charming <HI>Emilia,</HI> is unfaithful; &s;he was
with the Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI> at the &s;ame
Moment you look'd for her in the Gallery;
don't you de&s;erve to be treated thus? You, I
&s;ay, who by your Behaviour towards me
make your &s;elf unworthy of meeting with
better Treatment from others. She de&s;pi&s;ed
&s;uch a Conque&s;t as yours, as much as it is
de&s;pi&s;able in it &s;elf; and, if &s;he pretends to
&s;et any value upon it, it is only to enhaunce
the price of the Sacrifice &s;he is going to make
of it to your Rival. Adieu, ungrateful
Man, 'tis but rea&s;on you &s;hould enjoy
no more Quietne&s;s this Night than I
do, but with this difference, that I hope to
pa&s;s, before it is long, my Time with more
Tranquility than you. Send this Letter back
by the Bearer.</P>
<P>The Letter being &s;ealed up, &s;he or|dered
one of her <HI>Valets de Chambre</HI> to
give to the E. of <HI>A&mdash;n</HI> to have him
awakened, and to deliver it to him.
The Earl did not re&s;t &s;o quietly as my
Lady&mdash;imagined, being taken up
with ruminating upon this Adven|ture,
<PB N="86" REF="76">
not without conceiving &s;ome
Jealou&s;y again&s;t <HI>Emilia,</HI> which was
&s;trangely hightned by this Letter. He
could not imagine what could move
her to write at &s;o late an Hour; the
more when he con&s;idered the Subject
of it; he read it over &s;everal times;
he ruminated upon the matter, and
appeared &s;o di&s;tracted with Thoughts,
that the <HI>Valet de Chambre</HI> of my Lady
&mdash;(who had been order'd to ob|&s;erve
nar$owly his Behaviour) &s;aid, he
could believe no otherwi&s;e, than that
he had been the Bearer of &s;ome very
bad News. He ask'd him &s;everal times
whether he intended to &s;end an An&s;wer
by him to his Mi&s;tre&s;s, and at la&s;t the
Earl writ the following Words at the
bottom of my Lady&mdash;Letter.</P>
<P>You are too charitable, Madam, in im|parting
to me the Treacheries acted again&s;t
me. I &s;carce ever imagined you would have
been willing to be my Confident, but &s;ince you
have thought fit to be &s;o, I am ready to tru&s;t
you al&s;o with my Secrets, and a&s;&s;ure you,
that <HI>Emilia</HI> having thought fit to make me
her Bubble, I am re&s;olved to find out a way
to puni&s;h her &s;o &s;everely, as may abundantly
revenge your Quarrel; and perhaps, in the
con&s;equence of my Procedure, you will meet
with &s;ome rea&s;on to pardon me, for what you
&s;o much complain of now.</P>
<P>Having given a &s;trict charge to the
<HI>Valet,</HI> to deliver the Billet into his Mi|&s;tre&s;&s;es
Hands, he abandon'd him&s;elf
<PB N="87" REF="77">
to the mo&s;t melancholly Reflections that
can well be imagined; &s;ometimes he
would fain have call'd in que&s;tion the
truth of this Advice, and of the Per|&s;on
that &s;ent it, &s;ince her Sincerity
might be well &s;u&s;pected in a matter of
this nature: But after all, he could not
but believe it at la&s;t, even in &s;pite of
him&s;elf, and nothing being more natu|ral,
than to believe what we fear; he
would not have que&s;tioned the Truth,
even if there had been le&s;s Probability
in it than really there was. He actually
loved <HI>Emilia,</HI> and had been beloved by
her; but the Sweets he had enjoy'd in
her Conver&s;ation, now &s;erved only to
render her Infidelity the more bitter,
and in&s;upportable. He was very haugh|ty,
di&s;cerning, and of a high Rank,
and being &s;en&s;ible of his great Quali|fications,
they could not but in&s;pire him
with a mo&s;t violent Re&s;entment again&s;t
his Mi&s;tre&s;s. On the other hand, con|&s;idering
that nothing but his Indiffe|rency
to my Lady&mdash;could have
brought upon him this Di&s;grace, he
could not but reproach him&s;elf, for
having abandon'd the fine&s;t Woman at
Court, who treated him with &s;o much
Tenderne&s;s, and had preferred him be|fore
&s;o many Rivals of the greate&s;t
Quality; reflecting, I &s;ay, that after
having thought him&s;elf beloved by two
Ladies at once, and being clo&s;ely put to
it which to chu&s;e, he now could not
<PB N="88" REF="78">
make &s;ure of either, di&s;tracted with
the&s;e Thoughts, he did not &s;hut his
Eyes all the remaining part of the
Night, till towards Morning, being then
quite &s;pent with Thoughts, as it hap|pens,
when People find them&s;elves tor|mented
with &s;uch-like Pa&s;&s;ions. It was
very late, when he heard &s;ome body
exchanging &s;ome Words with one of
his <HI>Vale$s de Chambre,</HI> &s;o he asked, who
was there: The E. of S. <HI>Albans</HI> entring
the Room, told him: I believe all your
Servants have agreed to try my Pati|ence;
I have &s;pent near an Ho$r in
coming to your Chamber-door, and in
per&s;wading them to open it for me, &s;o
I was going away ju&s;t now. The E. of
<HI>A&mdash;n</HI> having begg'd his Pardon for
the $mpertinency of his Servants, ask'd
whether he could do him any Service.
The E. of <HI>S. Albans</HI> &s;eeing him&s;elf a|lone
with him, I bring back to you,
<HI>&s;aid $he,</HI> a Letter, which you will be
&s;urprized to &s;ee in my Hands: Here|upon
he produced the Letter, written
by my Lady&mdash;to him, with his
An&s;wer at the bottom: What can this
mean, <HI>cry'd the Earl of</HI> A&mdash;n, pray ex|plain
to me a Riddle, too intricate for
me to unfold. I will tell you in a few
Words, <HI>reply'd the Earl:</HI> About four
Days ago, the King having received In|formation,
that there was &s;ome Con|&s;piracy
&s;et on foot in <HI>London,</HI> again&s;t
the Government, and being willing to
<PB N="89" REF="79">
find out the bottom of it without
much Noi&s;e, ordered the Guards to
Watch; and to &s;eize, without Di&s;tin|ction,
all they &s;hould meet in the
Night-time. My Lady&mdash;'s <HI>Va|let
de Chambre</HI> was already got a pretty
way from your Hou&s;e, when being
&s;topt, and &s;earched, he begg'd heartily
to have the Letter re&s;tor'd to him, but
being without a Super&s;cription, and
therefore the more &s;u&s;pected, of con|taining
&s;ome Secret of State, the poor
Fellow was committed to Pri&s;on, and
carry'd this Morning before the King.
The Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI> and I happen|ing
ju&s;t then to be there, he ordered
me to open the Letter, and to read out a|loud
the Contents thereof: He was not
in the lea&s;t &s;urprized at your Corre|&s;pondence
with my Lady&mdash;but
was at your Change, and the Duke of
<HI>Monmouth</HI>'s Pa&s;&s;ion for <HI>Emilia,</HI> but could
not forbear laughing at the oddne&s;s of
the Chance, which made this Letter
fall into his Hands. He look'd upon
the Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI> with an Air,
that di&s;covered more of plea&s;antne&s;s
than Anger; Well, <HI>&s;aid he to him,</HI> how
long will you be unfaithful to your
Wife? Do you never intend to fix
your Love? Sir, <HI>replyed the Duke,</HI> the&s;e
are only &s;light Amu&s;ements, we take
to ea&s;e our &s;elves, after being tired
with &s;erious Matters. Truly, &s;aid the
King, you have then abundance of
<PB N="90" REF="80">
&s;erious Bu$ine&s;s in your Head, becau&s;e
your Hand has &s;uch frequent occa&s;ion
for Amu&s;ements. He being nettled
and a&s;ham'd, you might have &s;een the
Marks of his Anger in his Face; and
drawing nearer, was going to take
the Letter out of my Hand; but I
fearing lea&s;t his Spite again&s;t my
Lady&mdash;might induce him to put
it to an ill u&s;e, de&s;ired him to let me
keep it, till I could re&s;tore it to her
&s;elf. She does not de&s;erve the E&s;teem
you have for her, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> &s;o as that the
King might under&s;tand him, and wear it
only for Revenge-&s;ake, you might not
let &s;lip &s;o happy an Opportunity as this.
The King fell a laughing again; and,
<HI>&s;aid he,</HI> I am &s;ure the E. of <HI>S. Albans</HI>
has long ago &s;ealed my Lady&mdash;'s
Pardon, in re&s;pect to the preference
&s;he gave to the E. of <HI>A&mdash;n</HI> before
him; for I know him to be very indulg|ing
to the Ladies, and he never cares to
vex them. Your Maje&s;ty does me Ju|&s;tice,
<HI>reply'd I,</HI> I own I extreamly loved
this Lady, and that if &s;he had been
plea&s;ed, &s;he might have turn'd me
which way &s;he would, but I can't hate
her, and the E. of <HI>A&mdash;n</HI> is too much
my Friend, that I &s;hould not give way
to him upon &s;uch an occo&s;ion as this.
The Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI> did not reli&s;h
my Opinion. Here, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> is a piece
of Genero&s;ity, without Compari&s;on;
for my part, again&s;t whom my Lady&mdash;
<PB N="91" REF="81">
has &s;pit her Venome, after I had made
her a &s;harer in my Secrets, and &s;ince
&s;he has made &s;uch ill u&s;e of it, I am re|&s;olved
to tell her, &s;he is the mo&s;t
indi&s;creet, and the mo&s;t malicious of
all Women living. The King leaving
his Clo&s;et, <HI>added the Earl of S.</HI> Albans, I
made all the ha&s;t I could with the Let|ter,
to let you know what had pa&s;s'd,
for I don't que&s;tion, but that the Duke
of <HI>Monmouth</HI> is gone to harangue this
poor afflicted Lady. Did ever you &s;ee
&s;uch an unfortunate Accident, &s;aid the
E. of <HI>A&mdash;n,</HI> when I reflect upon what
prejudice &s;he has conceived again&s;t me,
I am confident &s;he will accu&s;e me as the
Author of all the Mi&s;chief; and me|thinks
I am already &s;o &s;en&s;ible of the
Violence of <HI>Emilia,</HI> that I need nothing
more to add to my Vexation, My
Lord, <HI>continued he,</HI> 'tis impo&s;&s;ible to
make you &s;en&s;ible of the Obligation I
think I owe you, for what you have
done upon this Account, when it was
in your power to create me new Trou|bles,
but you are convinced by the
Letter it &s;elf, that I am no more your
Rival. 'Tis a good while ago, <HI>replyed
the E. of S.</HI> Albans, &s;ince I have quitted
that Preten&s;ion, I am at pre&s;ent in a
Condition to &s;ee all what pa&s;s'd, with|out
the lea&s;t Di&s;turbance. Would it
plea&s;e Heaven, <HI>cryd the Earl of</HI> A&mdash;n
Would it plea&s;e Heaven I could &s;ay &s;o too
in re&s;pect to <HI>Emilia.</HI> Whil&s;t they were
<PB N="92" REF="82">
di&s;cour&s;ing the matter betwixt them,
my Lady&mdash;'s <HI>Valet de Chambre</HI>
thought it the neare&s;t way to get his
Liberty, to give notice to his Mi&s;tre&s;s
of what had happen'd, whil&s;t &s;he pa&s;s'd
every moment under mo&s;t dreadful Ap|prehen&s;ions,
not knowing what to think
of his long &s;tay, e&s;pecially, after
having &s;ent &s;everal Me&s;&s;engers to the
E. of <HI>A&mdash;n</HI> to enquire after him, but
could learn no more, than that he was
gone from my Lords, immediately af|ter
he had received his An&s;wer. Thus
tormented with a thou&s;and different
Inquietudes, &s;he had not re&s;ted one
minute; at la&s;t &s;he receives a Letter
from her <HI>Valet de Chambre,</HI> containing
an Account of the whole Adventure,
and how the E. of <HI>A&mdash;n</HI>'s Letter was
taken from him. Good God! what an
addition of Mi&s;ery proved this di&s;mal
News to the poor, my Lady&mdash;
to &s;ee her Letter expo&s;ed to others,
and perhaps fallen into the Hands of
her Enemies whereof hand&s;ome Ladies
have not a few. She con&s;idered, that
the Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI> di&s;obliged, <HI>Emi|lia</HI>
expo&s;ed, and the E. of <HI>A&mdash;n</HI> treat|ed
wor&s;e than all the re&s;t. She knew
not what to do, or on what &s;ide the
Storm was like to break out fir&s;t, when
word was brought, that the Duke of
<HI>Monmouth</HI> was come to pay her a Vi&s;it.
He had parted with her the Night be|fore,
with uncommon Demon&s;tration
<PB N="93" REF="83">
of Friend&s;hip, and &s;hewn him&s;elf &s;o
far concerned in her Troubles concei|ved
at her Encounter with the E.
of <HI>A&mdash;n</HI> and the Governe&s;&s;es, that it
was no great matter of wonder, if he
came to know how &s;he had done the
la&s;t Night; but her Heart foreboded
nothing that reli&s;h'd of Peace or Tran|quility.
She was pondering with her
felf what to &s;ay to the Duke in ca&s;e he
had heard any thing of her Letter; and
&s;o neglecting to give Orders for his be|ing
admitted into her Chamber, the
Duke, impatient of Delays, enters ab|ruptly,
and by the Looks he gave her,
&s;ufficiently di&s;covered the Sentiments
of his Heart. He was ju&s;t going to
&s;peak, when &s;he interrupting him, Oh!
my Lord, <HI>&s;aid &s;he,</HI> come fini&s;h the
Work, in quite overwhelming me with
Grief; come reproach me with my
Frailty, come pour out all your inju|rious
Expre&s;&s;ions again&s;t me; I de&s;erve
your Wrath, and have no other Arms
left to defend my &s;elf again&s;t them,
than a &s;incere Confe&s;&s;ion of my Faults.
When you commit &s;uch indi&s;creet
Actions, <HI>&s;aid the Duke to her,</HI> when
you take delight in ruining a young
Lady of Quallity, and that for no other
Crime, in re&s;pect to you, than to be
liked by the E. of <HI>A&mdash;n</HI> what can you
expect from tho&s;e Per&s;ons who profe&s;s
them&s;elves her Friends? I expect no|thing
le&s;s than their utmo&s;t Anger,
<PB N="94" REF="84">
<HI>reply'd my Lady&mdash;</HI> and I am rea|dy
to &s;ubmit to every thing, without
Complaint, without looking for Revenge.
But if after all, the Fault I commited
in di&s;clo&s;ing your Secret, may admit
of &s;ome Excu&s;e, put your &s;elf in my
place, and reflect, what a Woman is,
enraged with Spite and Envy. Re|member,
'tis hard to pre&s;erve your
Rea&s;on, when you lo&s;e all you love,
and that I had no better way of be|ing
revenged of the Earl. If after this,
my Lord, you don't think me &s;uffici|ently
unhappy, add to my Affliction,
by the mo&s;t cruel Torments you can
invent. She appear'd &s;o much afflicted
at the&s;e Words, and &s;o fair in
his Eyes, that the Duke, who before
had had &s;ome Inclinations of her Love
(to which he was &s;carce able to re&s;i&s;t)
could not find in his Heart, to give her
any further occa&s;ion of Trouble. The
Condition you are in at pre&s;ent, Ma|dam,
<HI>&s;aid he,</HI> is a &s;ufficient Revenge to
me, and I &s;hould upbraid my &s;elf,
&s;hould I add new occa&s;ion of Inquie|tude
to your Troubles, but at lea&s;t,
a&s;&s;i&s;t me in repairing the Evil you have
created your &s;elf. If it be not too late,
<HI>reply'd &s;he,</HI> there is nothing I would not
do; but pray thus far &s;atisfy my Cu|rio&s;ity,
as to tell me how you came
acquainted with the News of this Let|ter.
The Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI> &s;eem'd
&s;urpriz'd, and told her, Has not the E.
<PB N="95" REF="85">
of <HI>S. Albans</HI> given you already an Ac|count
of it? Good God! <HI>cry'd &s;he,</HI> who
is it you name? Is it po&s;&s;ible, that he,
among the re&s;t, has been acquainted
with my Frailties? The Duke then told
her all that happened before the King;
and that the E. of <HI>S. Albans</HI> had under|taken
to deliver the Letter to her; at
the&s;e Words &s;he appear'd more &s;urpri|zed
than ever; &s;he very well remem|bred
what indifferent an Entertain|ment
&s;he had given to that Lord, and
&s;he could &s;carce believe, but that he
would revenge his Quarrel. How came
it to pa&s;s, <HI>&s;aid &s;he,</HI> looking very melan|cholly
upon the Duke, you would leave
my Letter in his Hands? Is this the
act of a Friend? How, Madam, <HI>&s;aid
he,</HI> would you have me be your Friend?
I &s;wear to you, I was &s;o far from
taking your part, that I would have
ruin'd you upon the Spot, and that if
the Letter had come into my Hands,
I would have po&s;ted it up. You could
have done nothing better to plea&s;e <HI>Emi|lia,</HI>
&s;aid &s;he, with a great deal of &s;eem|ing
Moderation, but &s;uch as proceeded
more from a pretence of Prudence,
than from her Inclinations. I could
have been contented, <HI>reply'd the Duke,</HI>
to have ruin'd <HI>Emilia,</HI> provided I could
have involved you in her Ruin; and
when I reflect in what manner I was
betray'd by you, it is impo&s;&s;ible for
me to pardon it. Let us not talk of
<PB N="96" REF="86">
that any more, my Lord, <HI>&s;aid &s;he,</HI> giv|ing
him her Hand, which he took and
ki&s;s'd (with an eagerne&s;s far different
from the Sentiments of an irreconci|lable
Enemy) I mu&s;t endeavour to
make you amends, by &s;ome good
Offices. Alas! Madam, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> look|ing
upon her with a mo&s;t tender Eye,
Don't look for an Opportunity of do|ing
that any where el&s;e, but with your
&s;elf, &s;ince it is ea&s;y to be met with
there: I have lov'd you for a con&s;ide|rable
time; you have always appeared
in my Eyes, one of the mo&s;t lovely
Women in the World; and if I did not
make my Addre&s;&s;es to you &s;ooner, it
was becau&s;e I under&s;tood, that the E.
of <HI>A&mdash;n</HI> had got &s;o firm Footing
there already, that I thought it impo&s;|&s;ible
to &s;upplant him; but &s;ince you
have found him unfaithful, leave him
to his corrupted Palate, and let us make
Peace together. My Lady&mdash;
was not of &s;o &s;evere a Temper, as to
be angry with the Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI>
for this Declaration of Love, whereby
&s;he might have an Opportunity of be|ing
revenged of <HI>Emilia;</HI> but judging
rightly, &s;he ought not to take every
thing for Truth, which &s;eem'd to be
&s;poke to her only by chance, &s;he thought
it be&s;t to give a turn of a Je&s;t to what
the Duke had propos'd to her in ear|ne&s;t,
and to break off the Di&s;cour&s;e,
&s;he ask'd, where the E. of <HI>S. Albans</HI>
<PB N="97" REF="87">
could be all this while with her Letter:
He is que&s;tionle&s;s, <HI>reply'd the Duke,</HI> with
the E. of <HI>A&mdash;n</HI> for of late they are
mo&s;t intimate Friends. I know the
rea&s;on of it, <HI>&s;aid &s;he,</HI> and if we have
nothing el&s;e to talk of, I can tell it
you. The Duke, without giving her
any An&s;wer, de&s;ired her only to
go to the Dutche&s;s of&mdash;and to
give notice to <HI>Emilia</HI> of what had hap|pen'd.
A fine Commi&s;&s;ion indeed, <HI>re|ply'd
&s;he,</HI> would you have me go to tell
her what I have done again&s;t her? I
have no other way to let her under|&s;tand
it, <HI>&s;aid the Duke,</HI> interrupting her;
and it is no more than an act of Ju&s;tice,
that after having dealt &s;o ill with her,
you &s;hould do her a &s;mall good turn:
But, <HI>reply'd &s;he,</HI> do you &s;uppo&s;e &s;he will
put the lea&s;t Confidence in me? I will
write a Letter to her, and you may talk
with her alone. And with what an
Eye would you have me look upon
the Governe&s;s, continued my Lady
&mdash;after having felt the Blows of
her Catoches; Don't look upon her
at all, <HI>&s;aid the Duke,</HI> you are &s;o much
above her, that you are not obliged to
all the &s;trict Rules of Civility with her
Civilities, &s;aid my Lady&mdash;in an
angry Tone, and her Colour ri&s;ing in
her Face, I &s;uppo&s;e I &s;hall pay her none;
&s;he may be glad if I &s;ee her without
&s;coffing at her. The Duke bur&s;t out a
laughing, and &s;he asking him how he
<PB N="98" REF="88">
could laugh at things which had try'd
her Patience to the highe&s;t Degree.
To tell you the truth, &s;aid he to her,
I can't think of that Combat wherein I
&s;aw you engaged la&s;t Night with the
two old Matrons, and how nettled you
were, when I &s;aw you, without laugh|ing
heartily. Truly, &s;aid &s;he, with a
&s;orrowful Air, it was a plea&s;ant Sight,
and con&s;idering you propo&s;e to per|&s;wade
me, that you have a peculiar E|&s;teem
for me, you take the right way
for it. The Duke blu&s;h'd at this Check
given him, excu&s;ing the matter with
the Oddne&s;s of the thing, and wi&s;hing
it had happen'd to any body el&s;e but
her &s;elf. He then went into the Clo|&s;et,
and writ the following Letter to
<HI>Emilia.</HI></P>
<P>There are too many Confidents of my
Pa&s;&s;ion for you; what I now write, is brought
to you by the Hands of a Lady, who may be
&s;u&s;pected by you; but &s;he has given me her
Word to &s;erve us, and it is no more than
what &s;he ought to do; after all the ill Offi|ces
&s;he has endeavoured to do us; you will
know by her all that happen'd, which renders
me almo&s;t incon&s;olable; if you encrea&s;e my
Pain, by giving fre&s;h occa&s;ion of Trouble,
you are the mo&s;t cruel Woman in the World.</P>
<P>He pray'd my Lady&mdash;to make
all the ha&s;te &s;he could to go to S. <HI>James</HI>'s,
&s;he &s;aid &s;he would, and &s;o they parted
very good Friends. However, as &s;he was
<PB N="99" REF="89">
going thither, &s;he would needs call at
the E. of <HI>A&mdash;n</HI> in hopes to meet
there with the E. of S. <HI>Albans,</HI> and
finding his Footman at the Door
with his Coach, &s;he &s;ent in word, &s;he
had a mind to &s;peak with him for one
Minute, and that &s;he would &s;tay for
him in the Mall. It being a con&s;idera|ble
time &s;ince they had &s;poke to one
another, he could not imagine what it
was &s;he came about; there being but
little likelihood &s;he &s;hould already have
got Intelligence of what had happen'd
with her Letter, the King and the
Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI> being the only Per|&s;ons
who could give her notice of it;
the King did not concern him&s;elf &s;o far
in the matter, and the Duke hated her
too much to give him&s;elf that trouble.
He &s;ent her word he would not fail to
meet her in the Mall, and turning to|wards
the E. of <HI>A&mdash;n,</HI> is not this,
&s;aid he, a fine Invention to create a
Jealou&s;y in you? She is not &s;o fond of
me, reply'd he with a mode&s;t Air, to
take &s;o much Pains for me, &s;he knows
well enough what &s;he is adoing: Tru|ly,
reply'd the E. of S. <HI>Albans,</HI> I
don't value her, and if &s;he intended
to bugbear you, &s;he mu&s;t have ca&s;t her
Eyes upon one who&s;e De&s;erts might
give you &s;ome Umbrage, but &s;uch an
old Spark as I, is good for nothing. I
engage, &s;aid the E. of <HI>A&mdash;n</HI> that this
moment &s;he thinks of neither of us,
<PB N="100" REF="90">
'tis her Letter that takes up her
Thoughts. Que&s;tionle&s;s, the Duke of
<HI>Monmouth</HI> being quite out of his Wits
about it, has told the whole Story to
&s;ome, who have given her an account
of it again; were it not for the &s;hare
<HI>Emilia</HI> has in this Adventure, I would
agree with you, reply'd the E. of
S. <HI>Albans,</HI> but he will certainly take
care of her Reputation. Oh! &s;aid the
E. of <HI>A&mdash;n,</HI> how little are you
acquainted with his Temper, you will
find, he will follow only his cholerick
Humour, and do all the Mi&s;chief him|&s;elf,
that is to be done. You &s;hall &s;oon
know, &s;aid the E. of S. <HI>Albans,</HI> for I am
ju&s;t going to my Lady&mdash;.</P>
<P>This Lady coming to the Dutche&s;&s;es
fir&s;t, and not &s;eeing her, only enquired
aftr her Health, and then going to the
Apartment of the Ladies of Honour,
the fir&s;t Per&s;on &s;he met with there, was
the Deputy Governe&s;s, who made her
a low Courte&s;y, but my Lady would
not as much as vouch&s;afe her a Look,
going further into the Room, &s;he found
<HI>Emilia</HI> talking with the Governe&s;s, and
&s;he &s;uppo&s;ing my Lady to have a mind
to &s;peak with <HI>Emilia,</HI> left her, and
advanced not without &s;ome di&s;turbance
to meet and receive my Lady&mdash;
who without ca&s;ting one Eye upon her,
took <HI>Emilia</HI> by the Hand, telling her
&s;he wanted to &s;peak with her in pri|vate.
The Governe&s;s was of a haughty
<PB N="101" REF="91">
Temper, and thinking &s;he had taken
too much from my Lady already, in
offering her the fir&s;t Civilities, without
any returns on her &s;ide; and con&s;ide|ring
that it was not to my Lady, but to
<HI>Emilia,</HI> &s;he intended to give the Blows
with her Catoches in the late Noctur|nal
Combat, &s;he judged &s;he ought
not take it &s;o far ami&s;s. Thus being
well plea&s;ed, that by her Po&s;t &s;he might
challenge a pretence of revenging her
&s;elf upon the Spot, &s;he took <HI>Emilia</HI> by
one hand, and then addre&s;&s;ing her &s;elf
to my Lady&mdash;This is not a fit place,
&s;aid &s;he, Madam, to talk in private;
you mu&s;t not di&s;cour&s;e with <HI>Emilia</HI> here,
unle&s;s in my Pre&s;ence. Not to talk
to her, I will talk to her, reply'd my La|dy,
very haughtily; and to make you
the third Per&s;on in our Conver&s;ation,
pray don't think of it. And I &s;ay, re|ply'd
the Governe&s;s, pulling away
<HI>Emilia</HI> with all her force, you &s;hall not
&s;peak one word to her, unle&s;s I am
by, whil&s;t my Lady&mdash;fearing &s;he
&s;hould draw her away, pull'd with all
her Strength by the other Arm. You
under&s;tand your &s;elf &s;o little, &s;aid &s;he
to the Governe&s;s, that I am not much
&s;urpri&s;ed at your Impertinencies, and
were you worth my Anger I&mdash;
The Governe&s;s interrupting her, gave
her as haughty an An&s;wer, whil&s;t both
pull'd poor <HI>Emilia</HI> by the Arms, no
otherwi&s;e than if they intended to pull
<PB N="102" REF="92">
her to pieces. The Noi&s;e they made
having brought <HI>Philadelphia</HI> out of an
adjacent Clo&s;et, where &s;he then was,
&s;he did all &s;he could to appea&s;e the
Quarrel, but being a Per&s;on of no &s;uf|ficient
Authority, &s;he lo&s;t her Labour,
and they made as much noi&s;e as ever.
Ju&s;t then the Counte&s;s of&mdash;who
was going to pay a Vi&s;it to the Dutch|e&s;s
of&mdash;happening to pa&s;s by the
Apartment of the Ladies of Honour,
thought no le&s;s than that they were go|ing
to &s;trangle one another, &s;o in &s;he
went, and to her no &s;mall &s;urpri&s;e,
found my Lady&mdash;and the Gover|ne&s;s,
&s;till at the pulling Sport: Oh,
dear Madam, cry'd <HI>Emilia,</HI> pray make
Peace betwixt the&s;e Ladies, and deliver
me out of their Hands, for I know not
what to do. The Pre&s;ence of the
Counte&s;s of&mdash;&s;omewhat allay'd
their Fury, but it was a good while be|fore
&s;he was able to learn the &s;ubject of
the Quarrel, becau&s;e they were all three
&s;peaking at once; but the Counte&s;s
&s;hewing a great deal of Patience, in
letting them &s;pend their fir&s;t Fury,
(whereof few are Ma&s;ters upon &s;uch
like Occa&s;ions) &s;he gave them a favou|rable
Ear one after another. She bla|med
my Lady&mdash;for not having
repay'd the common Civilities to the
Governe&s;s, (for &s;he knew nothing of
their fir&s;t Engagement in the Gallery,)
this being a &s;ecret Article they did not
<PB N="103" REF="93">
think fit to mention in the Treaty of
Peace. Afterwards &s;he check'd the
the Governe&s;s, for her pretended Cir|cum&s;pection,
in attempting to prevent
a Per&s;on of my Lady&mdash;'s Quali|ties,
from di&s;cour&s;ing a Lady of Ho|nour
of the Dutche&s;s of&mdash;and
decided the matter thus far in fa|vour
of my Lady, that &s;he ought to
talk all alone with <HI>Emilia.</HI></P>
<P>Hereupon they went immediately in|to
the &s;ame Clo&s;et, from whence <HI>Phi|ladelphia</HI>
was come ju&s;t before; but this
being done in a fright, occa&s;ioned by
the noi&s;e &s;he heard in the next Room,
&s;he had left behind her, un&s;eal'd, out
of ha&s;te, a Billet &s;he had begun to
write to the Duke of <HI>Monmouth,</HI> and
<HI>Emilia</HI> being the fir&s;t who ca&s;t her
Eyes upon it, &s;he read the&s;e follow|ing
Words:</P>
<P>Cure your &s;elf of your Pa&s;&s;ion for <HI>Emilia;</HI>
&s;he is indeed lovely, but unfaithful, and you
were not made to be impo&s;ed upon. If you
will throw off her Fetters, and are inclined to
embrace others, a certain young Lady, no
le&s;s de&s;erving than her &s;elf, makes you a
tender of hers, and Love will &s;hew you the
&s;ecret of making them not very heavy. <HI>But&mdash;</HI></P>
<P>Can any thing be more irregular than
the Conduct of <HI>Philadelphia?</HI> cry'd <HI>Emi|lia.</HI>
See, Madam, pray &s;ee, what a fine
Declaration of Love &s;he has made.
My Lady&mdash;having peru&s;ed the
<PB N="104" REF="94">
Billet with no little &s;urprize, &s;aid, Up|on
whom has &s;he fix'd her Choice. I know
not an&s;wered <HI>Emilia,</HI> but it always &s;eem'd
to me, as if the E. of <HI>A&mdash;n</HI> was not in|different
to her: And to me, reply'd
my Lady&mdash;it always appear'd as
if &s;he had a particular Kindne&s;s for the
Duke of <HI>Monmouth. Emilia</HI> folded up
the Letter, and without &s;aying one
Word more, was agoing to put it into
her Pocket; I can't allow of that, &s;aid
my Lady&mdash;&s;natching it from her,
you mu&s;t not keep in your Hands a
Letter, which enables you to hurt <HI>Phi|ladelphia:</HI>
You are her Rival, and de&s;ire
of Revenge may prompt you to do
&s;omething, which you your &s;elf could
perhaps be &s;orry for at another time:
There is no rea&s;on, reply'd <HI>Emilia,</HI> you
&s;hould take this Letter from me, and
keep it your felf; for perhaps you have
as much rea&s;on to hate her as my &s;elf:
however, Madam, I owe you too much
re&s;pect to di&s;pute any thing with you.</P>
<P>Good God, &s;aid my Lady&mdash;in|terrupting
her, what makes us trifle a|way
our time thus, when I am come
hither to talk with you about Mat|ters
of much greater Moment to us,
and to make you my Confident; I have
a Letter for you, wherein you will be
&s;atisfy'd you ought to con&s;ider me as
your Friend. She then put her Hand
into her Pocket, intending to pull it
out, but could not &s;ind it; &s;he &s;earched
<PB N="105" REF="95">
every where but in vain. What will
the Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI> think of me,
cry'd &s;he, with a mournful Counte|nance,
con&s;idering what has happen'd
already, he will think no le&s;s, than that
I have betray'd him; they both join'd
in their Lamentations. At la&s;t, pray
Madam, &s;aid <HI>Emilia,</HI> tell me at lea&s;t,
what it is you were to relate to me.
No, reply'd my Lady&mdash;I can &s;ay
nothing without the Billet the Duke
gave me; I have not Strength to &s;peak
under &s;uch continual Vexations; that
very Moment <HI>Philadelphia</HI> came into the
Clo&s;et with an Air, which &s;ufficiently
&s;hew'd, that by this time &s;he had re|membred
her Letter; but dur&s;t not
demand it, for fear of being ask'd &s;ome
Que&s;tions &s;he did not care to an&s;wer,
by her, that had taken it; &s;he look'd
upon them both one after another, as
if &s;he intended to gue&s;s at their Thoughts
by their Eyes: But they being upon
their Guard, &s;he could not di&s;cover any
thing. However, there being a nece&s;|&s;ity
of not parting without &s;ettling the
matter: Come, &s;aid &s;he, let a good
Under&s;tanding be re-e&s;tabli&s;h'd betwixt
us; you have my Letter, and I have
found yours; I am willing to re&s;tore
yours, provided you will give me back
mine: The match is not equal, reply'd
<HI>Emilia,</HI> abruptly, you are not mentio|ned
in the Billet that is in your Hands,
but in that which we have, are very
<PB N="106" REF="96">
di&s;obliging Expre&s;&s;ions again&s;t me. I
would fain know what rea&s;on you have
for &s;o doing, and whether you have in
this acted the part of a Friend, and of a
Companion. Yes, reply'd <HI>Philadelphia,</HI>
every thing is permitted, when one
Ioves, and would make ones &s;elf to be
beloved again. Don't quarrel with me
upon that point, you have two Lovers:
One is too much, and if I had robb'd
you of him, I am not obliged to make
you Re&s;titution.</P>
<P>My Lady&mdash;who was overjoy'd
at the Sight of the Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI>'s
Letter, and unwilling to &s;ee the&s;e young
Ladies enter into any further Di&s;pute,
re&s;tored the Letter to <HI>Philadelphia.</HI> Ma|dam,
cry'd <HI>Emilia,</HI> mu&s;t not I know
unto whom this Letter was written.
No, you &s;hall never know it, reply'd
<HI>Philadelphia;</HI> but let this be your Com|fort,
that if you are ignorant of the
Name of my Lover, you are fully &s;a|tisfy'd,
at lea&s;t, in that of your Rival,
and &s;o &s;he left the Room. <HI>Emilia</HI> fetch|ing
a deep Sigh, which way &s;oever I
look, &s;aid &s;he, I &s;ee nothing but Rivals;
and even you, Madam, are one
of the mo&s;t dangerous among them.
Oh, don't lay that at my Door, &s;aid
my Lady&mdash;giving her the Duke
of <HI>Monmouth</HI>'s Letter. 'Tis you that I
am beholding to for a thou&s;and Evils;
'tis you that have robb'd me of a Heart,
without which I am not able to live,
<PB N="107" REF="97">
Are you not very cruel, thus to di&s;turb
my Repo&s;e? <HI>Emilia</HI> was too impatient
to peru&s;e the Duke's Letter, to return
an An&s;wer to the Complaints of this
Lady; But having read the Letter, &s;he
begg'd her to give her an Account of
what had happen'd, which my Lady
&mdash;did, but not without much
Di&s;turbance and Reluctancy; what &s;he
had writ to the E. of <HI>A&mdash;n,</HI> did
&s;o nearly affect <HI>Emilia,</HI> and the con&s;e|quence
thereof (the whole being come
to the King's and E. of S. <HI>Alban</HI>'s Ears)
proved &s;o trouble&s;ome that with all
the Wit &s;he had, (tho' &s;he was
Mi&s;tre&s;s of a con&s;iderable &s;hare) &s;he
could not give it a tolerable hand&s;ome
Turn. <HI>Emilia</HI> cry'd mo&s;t bitterly, and
in &s;pite of all the Care&s;&s;es, and asking
of Pardon of my Lady, remain'd incon|&s;olable.
No, &s;aid <HI>Emilia,</HI> I can't com|prehend,
what &s;hould move the Duke
of <HI>Monmouth</HI> to make you the Me&s;&s;enger
to me of the Misfortunes whereof you
your &s;elf have been the Author, when
at the &s;ame time I knew not how to
obviate them. He was forc'd to pre&s;s
me very hard before he could engage
me to undertake this Errand, reply'd
my Lady&mdash;and to confe&s;s to you
the real Truth, I would have been very
glad to have been excu&s;ed; For, having
been the occa&s;ion of Di&s;content to you, I
was not very willing to own it to you.
I am apt to believe, &s;aid <HI>Emilia,</HI> this is
<PB N="108" REF="98">
the only thing that troubles you, for
as for the matter it &s;elf, you are not &s;or|ry
for it. My Lady, touch'd to the
quick with the&s;e Words, and believing
that her pre&s;ent Conde&s;cen&s;ion, toge|ther
with the Di&s;grace &s;he had received
from the Governe&s;s, de&s;erv'd rather
&s;ome Acknowledgment from <HI>Emilia,</HI> &s;he
was &s;o enraged thereat, that &s;he could
not forbear to break out into bitter Re|proaches
and Threats. You are a little in|grateful!
cry'd &s;he, you are unworthy
of the Intelligence I have given you
concerning your ill Conduct; 'tis that
that will prove your Ruin, and 'tis in
vain I &s;ee, to pretend to prevent it:
As for me, who fore&s;ee your De&s;tiny,
I will for the future ha&s;ten it; I will
make your Nocturnal Appointment with
the Duke, publick, and I will repre&s;ent
it in &s;uch natural Colours, that every one
&s;hall &s;ay, the Picture is done to the
Life. And &s;o, Madam, &s;aid <HI>Emilia,</HI>
flu&s;h'd with Spite and Anger, I will &s;et
you out, according to your De&s;erts:
If you go about to bring upon the
Stage my Frailties, I can tell &s;ome of
yours of an older Date, and you may
be &s;ure I will tell the Story from the
beginning to the end. My Lady&mdash;
highly exa&s;perated at the&s;e Threatning
Expre&s;&s;ions, ca&s;t mo&s;t furious Looks
upon <HI>Emilia,</HI> and fully recalling to
mind all the Sufferings &s;he had under|gone,
ever &s;ince the E. of <HI>A&mdash;n</HI>
<PB N="109" REF="99">
had been in love with this young Wo|man,
&s;he laid hold of an Ink-Gla&s;s full
of Ink, which <HI>Philadelphia</HI> had made u&s;e
of ju&s;t before, when &s;he writ to the Duke
of <HI>Monmouth,</HI> and threw it into <HI>Emi|lia</HI>'s
Face, and then left the Room with
a quick Pace, to avoid the con&s;equence
of &s;uch a violent Action, which would
in all probability have ended in a Com|bat
with <HI>Emilia.</HI> This young Lady
left thus almo&s;t in De&s;pair, cry'd more
for Rage than Vexation; &s;he dur&s;t not
appear in the Apartment of the Ladies
of Honour, for fear of being ridiculed.
But &s;oon changing her Thoughts, began
to con&s;ider of matters of greater Con&s;e|quence,
<HI>viz.</HI> how to appea&s;e the E. of
<HI>A&mdash;n,</HI> about her meeting the
Duke of <HI>Monmouth;</HI> And &s;he was &s;o much
taken up with the&s;e Con&s;iderations,
that &s;he forgot to wipe off the Ink from
her Face.</P>
<P>So &s;oon as the E. of S. <HI>Albans</HI> went a|way
from the E. of <HI>A&mdash;n,</HI> he
aro&s;e out of his Bed, to &s;tudy Revenge
again&s;t an unfaithful Mi&s;tre&s;s, and a
happy Rival. He took Coach, and as
yet unre&s;olved what to do, went to
the Park. The fir&s;t Per&s;on he met with,
being the E. of S. <HI>Albans,</HI> he made up
towards him, but being told he &s;tay'd
for my Lady&mdash;he went off imme|diately,
and meeting with &s;ome of his
Acquaintance, they found him in &s;uch
a Confu&s;ion, that they thought it be&s;t
<PB N="110" REF="100">
to leave him to his own Thoughts.
The better to avoid all manner of
Company, he retired to a By-place,
where he could &s;ee the Clo&s;et-Win|dows
from whence he had often had an
Interview with <HI>Emilia.</HI></P>
<P>The Sight thereof recalling to his
Mind, both his Love and his Indigna|tion,
and the la&s;t being then the predo|minant
Pa&s;&s;ion, he re&s;olved to break off
quite with a young Woman, who made
him a Sacrifice to the Duke of <HI>Mon|mouth,</HI>
and what mo&s;t of all vexed him
was, that this Sacrifice had been ex|po&s;ed
to the King. With this Re&s;olu|tion
away he goes to the Dutche&s;s
of&mdash;and entring &s;trait the Apart|ment
of the Ladies of Honour, he
found no body there but their Waiting-Women.
He ask'd where their Mi|&s;tre&s;&s;es
were, and being told <HI>Emilia</HI> was
in the Clo&s;et, he went in abruptly.
But how &s;tood he amazed? What vari|ety
of Thoughts di&s;tracted his Mind,
when he &s;aw her Face black, like a
Black-Moors, and her Eyes overflow'd
with Tears? He look'd upon her like
one Thunder-&s;truck, without uttering
one Word. She now remembring the
Ink on her Face, and con&s;equently the
cau&s;e of his Silence, judged this to be
a happy Moment to redre&s;s her Cre|dit.
She being a young Lady of great
Pre&s;ence of Mind, and of a quick Ap|prehen&s;ion,
who are tho&s;e tattling
<PB N="111" REF="101">
Fools, &s;aid &s;he, that have told you my
Re&s;olution of putting an end to my
Life? Why do you come here, to divert
me from &s;o good a De&s;ign? No, no,
my Lord, I can't out-live the ill Im|pre&s;&s;ions
my Enemies have made upon
you concerning my late Conduct. I
have as you &s;ee, begun to disfigure
this unfortunate Beauty, which is the
cau&s;e of your Jealou&s;y, and am re&s;olved
to fini&s;h what remains as yet undone.
If in any other Country but <HI>England,</HI> a
Woman &s;hould be heard to talk at that
rate, it would be look'd upon only as an
effect of a freaki&s;h Pa&s;&s;ion; but you
mu&s;t ob&s;erve, that there they are more
po&s;itive in &s;uch like Re&s;olutions, and
&s;ometimes out-do even the Hero's of
the ancient Romances.</P>
<P>The E. of <HI>A&mdash;n,</HI> reflecting up|on
what <HI>Emilia</HI> had told him, and touch|ed
to the very Heart, look'd upon her
with Eyes that &s;poke more of Love
than of Hatred. <HI>Emilia, Emilia,</HI> &s;aid
he, &s;ighing, 'tis not your Death that
can ju&s;tify your Heart to me, but it is
your Conduct mu&s;t do it: Had not the
Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI> obtained from you a
Meeting, which ought to have been re|&s;erved
for me alone, I &s;hould be le&s;s
unhappy, and your Virtue le&s;s expo|&s;ed.
I have nothing to upbraid my
&s;elf with, reply'd &s;he, unle&s;s it be to
have loved in your &s;elf, an ungrate|ful
and jealous Lover, who is apt to
<PB N="112" REF="102">
receive the wor&s;t of Impre&s;&s;ions again&s;t
me, let me be never &s;o innocent. 'Tis
true, I was in the Room with the Duke
of <HI>Monmouth,</HI> but it is no le&s;s true al|&s;o,
that I expected to have met you
there. He did get your Letter into
his Hands, he counterfeited your Wri|ting:
But what has he got by taking all
this Pains, nothing but to &s;ee him&s;elf
convinced of my Re&s;olution and Con|&s;tancy
for you? He left me all in De|&s;pair,
and I did imagine, you would
have been the mo&s;t &s;atisfy'd Man in the
World, after I &s;hould have told you the
oddne&s;s of this Adventure. Alas! my
Lord, in&s;tead of the expected Acknow|ledgement,
I lo&s;e you, and with you
my Honour and Reputation. She then
&s;igh'd and cry'd, with &s;uch Violence,
that &s;he was not able to &s;peak any long|er;
but &s;he had &s;aid enough, to con|vince
the E. of <HI>A&mdash;n</HI> of her
Tenderne&s;s and Fidelity. He threw
him&s;elf at her Feet, he took hold of
her Hands, and bedew'd them with his
Tears: He ask'd her pardon, for having
been &s;educed by Appearances, and enqui|red
how her Face became &s;o black. She
told him &s;he had broke the Ink-Bottle
in her own Face. He was ready to run
di&s;tracted, whereas any other but he
would &s;oon have ob&s;erved, there were
not the lea&s;t Marks of Cuts or Wounds
in her Face. But Lovers Eyes are in|fatuated.</P>
<P><PB N="113" REF="103">
The Earl left <HI>Emilia</HI> &s;o full of Love,
that &s;eeing the Earl of S. <HI>Albans</HI> walk|ing
with my Lady&mdash;in the Park,
he would needs go unto them, and ta|king
the Earl on one &s;ide, Take your
Share, my Lord, &s;aid he, in my Satis|faction,
<HI>Emilia</HI> is Con&s;tant, I am &s;atis|fy'd
&s;he loves me for ever; The whole
matter has been clear'd betwixt us, to
the Confu&s;ion of our Enemies; She is
the mo&s;t virtuous and mo&s;t tender
young Lady in the Univer&s;e, I adore
her, I am di&s;tracted for her, and am re|&s;olved
never to believe any thing to
her Di&s;advantage. Having &s;poken the&s;e
Words, he went his way, without as
much as looking upon my Lady&mdash;and
without &s;tanding for the Earls An&s;wer.
However, &s;he had continued &s;o near
them, as to under&s;tand every Word he
&s;poke, becau&s;e he talk'd pretty loud,
and if he had not, &s;he had too near a
Concern in the matter, not to li&s;ten to
their Di&s;cour&s;e with the utmo&s;t Atten|tion.
She was &s;o much afflicted there|at,
that the Earl of S. <HI>Albans</HI> might ea|&s;ily
di&s;cover the Sentiments of her
Heart, by the palene&s;s of her Counte|nance.
You are to be pity'd, Madam,
&s;aid he to her, &s;ighing, becau&s;e you are
in Love with a Man, who loves you no
longer. Alas! &s;aid &s;he, with a melan|cholly
Voice, 'tis this that reduces me
to De&s;pair. I &s;hall be in every Bodies
Mouth; my Frailty, and the mean Fi|gure
<PB N="114" REF="104">
I now make, will be the Subject of
every Bodies Di&s;cour&s;e. Madam, re|ply'd
he, had you been in the Humour
to accept of my Services, you would
never have been expo&s;ed to &s;uch cruel
Inquietudes. My Heart acts the Vo|lunteer,
reply'd &s;he, it con&s;ults nothing
but its own Inclinations, it was beyond
my power to regulate my Conduct, o|therwi&s;e
than I have done; pray pity
me, but don't aggravate my Pain, by
u&s;ele&s;s Reproaches. She was not in a
Condition to &s;ay more, &s;o returning to
her Lodgings, &s;he order'd her Servants
to let no body come to &s;peak with her,
except the Duke of <HI>Monmouth,</HI> unto
whom &s;he was willing to give an Ac|count
of what had pa&s;s'd, and the Earl
of S. <HI>Albans</HI> having re&s;tored the Letter
to her, this proved in &s;ome mea&s;ure an
allay to her Pain.</P>
<P>The Dake of <HI>Monmouth</HI> coming &s;oon
after to pay her a Vi&s;it, &s;he related to
him the different Pa&s;&s;ages that had hap|pen'd;
but when &s;he came to the Ad|venture
of the Ink-Bottle, wherewith
&s;he had made a Mask for <HI>Emilia,</HI> he
&s;eem'd to be much concern'd there|at,
and told her, he could not but
di&s;like &s;uch violent Proceedings with a
young Lady of Quality, and one whom
&s;he had much offended already in her
Letter to the Earl of <HI>A&mdash;n,</HI> and
for whom &s;he knew he had a very ten|der
Concern. But &s;o &s;oon as &s;he told
<PB N="115" REF="105">
him what pa&s;s'd betwixt the Earl of
<HI>A&mdash;n,</HI> and the Earl of S. <HI>Albans,</HI>
he turn'd his Anger another way; and
told her, he now hated her, as much as
he loved her before. He made my
Lady&mdash;repeat to him &s;everal
times, what &s;he had related before,
and was overjoy'd to try if he could
pick out &s;ome &s;eeming Contradictions,
which might rai&s;e in him &s;ome doubt of
the Truth of the Relation. He wi&s;hed
it might be a piece of her own invent|ing,
but &s;aw her remain &s;tedfa&s;t in
vouching the matter: At la&s;t, he re&s;ol|ved
to go to the Earl of S. <HI>Albans,</HI> in
order to be &s;atisfy'd in what he had been
told by the Earl of <HI>A&mdash;n.</HI></P>
<P>Ju&s;t as he was coming out of my
Lady&mdash;'s Lodgings, he e&s;py'd one
of the Earl's Footmen, and asking where
his Ma&s;ter was, he was told at Prince
<HI>R</HI>&mdash;The Duke hereupon order'd
his Coachman to drive thither with all
po&s;&s;ible &s;peed, and he, willing to obey
his Ma&s;ter, drove &s;o ha&s;tily, that he
overturn'd the Coach, but the Duke got
no harm, except &s;ome &s;light Contu&s;ions.
Several Per&s;ons of Quality that hap|pen'd
to pa&s;s by at the &s;ame time,
alighted out of their Coaches, to pay
their Compliments, which being retur|ned
by him, he went &s;traitways to the
Prince, and &s;ent in to de&s;ire the Earl of
S. <HI>Albans</HI> to come down to him; but one
of the Prince's Gentlemen came down
<PB N="116" REF="106">
to tell him from his Ma&s;ter, he was
come down Stairs to &s;peak with him.</P>
<P>The Duke did alight, but not with|out
&s;ome Reluctancy, all his Thoughts
running upon what my Lady&mdash;
had told him, &s;o that he was &s;carce fit
for any other Entertainment at that
Juncture. He was conducted into the
little Apartment of the Prince, whi|ther
he commonly u&s;ed to retire with
his be&s;t Friends; he was then a little
out of Order by a Brui&s;e he had recei|ved
lately; the Earl of S. <HI>Albans</HI> kept
him Company, and there was a Seaman
of <HI>Provence</HI> di&s;cour&s;ing with them. The
Duke of <HI>Monmouth,</HI> after having &s;aluted
the Prince, ask'd him whether he had any
thing to command him: I wi&s;h, &s;aid he,
you would join your Intere&s;t with
mine, in recommending this Seaman to
Captain <HI>David,</HI> to entertain him aboard
his Yatch. The Seaman al&s;o addre&s;&s;ed
him&s;elf to the Duke, but in &s;uch a
Jargon Dialect, that he could &s;carce
under&s;tand what he meant. However,
without enquiring any further into his
Qualifications, and what might induce
the Prince to de&s;ire his Recommenda|tion,
knowing, that his Authority over
Captain <HI>David</HI> was &s;uch, as not to fear
a Denial, he began to write his Letter;
Whil&s;t he was writing, the Seaman clapt
him upon the Shoulder, telling him, he
&s;hould not forget to mention in his Let|ter,
that he was a Native of <HI>Provence;</HI>
<PB N="117" REF="107">
within two Minutes he gave him ano|ther
Clap upon the Shoulder, telling
him, he under&s;tood his Bu&s;ine&s;s very
well. The Duke &s;eem'd &s;omewhat
&s;urpriz'd at his Boldne&s;s: But &s;oon af|ter
he gave him another &s;ound one,
worth all the re&s;t, de&s;iring him to put
&s;omething or other in his Letter. The
Duke began to be angry, and ri&s;ing ha|&s;tily
from his Chair, and looking back|wards,
were it not for the Re&s;pect I owe
to the Prince, &s;aid he to him, I would
teach thee how to be &s;o familiar with
me. He had no &s;ooner &s;poke the&s;e
Words, but the Seaman laugh'd in his
Face, as loud as he could, and the
Prince did the &s;ame. The Duke now
beginning to gue&s;s, there mu&s;t be &s;ome
My&s;tery in the ca&s;e, look'd attentively
upon the Seaman, and &s;oon knew him
to be the Duke of <HI>Buckingham.</HI> They
embraced like two dear Friends, and
notwith&s;tanding the Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI>'s
whole Mind was bent upon his amorous
Intreagues at that time, he was very wil|ling
to know the rea&s;on of this &s;trange
Metamorpho&s;is, which he de&s;ired he
would relate to him.</P>
<P>I will tell it you in a few Words, re|ply'd
the Duke of <HI>Buckingham.</HI> My
Lord and I being agreed to join our In|tere&s;t
and Power in the Delivery of the
Counte&s;s of&mdash;, and that which of
us &s;hould hear the fir&s;t News of her,
&s;hould communicate it to the other;
<PB N="118" REF="108">
I &s;et Watches about the Hou&s;e, to find
out, if po&s;&s;ible, where &s;he was, whil&s;t
I kept at &s;ome di&s;tance, wrapt up in
my Cloak; But there I might have &s;taid
till now, had it not been for my Lord
&mdash;His <HI>Valet de Chambre</HI>'s Wife nur|&s;ed
a Son of the Counte&s;&s;es; it was by
means of that Nur&s;e &s;he had written
formerly to my Lord&mdash;when &s;he
was carry'd into <HI>Pembrook&s;hire,</HI> and he
endeavoured to meet her. As &s;he could
not go into <HI>Holland</HI> without &s;ome nece&s;|&s;aries
(her Husband having re&s;olved
to carry her thither) he &s;ent <HI>E&s;ther</HI> to
fetch what &s;he de&s;ired, but attend|ed
by two Men-Servants, who had
&s;trict Orders given them, not to &s;tir
from her till they had brought her back
to the place, where he lay conceal'd
with his Lady, being at a great di&s;tance
from his own. Accordingly, <HI>E&s;ther</HI>
pack'd up her Mi&s;tre&s;s's Baggage, and
ea&s;ily found means to &s;peak to the
Nur&s;e, under pretence that &s;he &s;hould
a&s;&s;i&s;t her for better Di&s;patches &s;ake.
Whil&s;t they were bu&s;y in &s;o doing,
without being overheard by any body,
&s;he took this Opportunity to tell her;
Go tell my Lord&mdash;, it is no time
to be angry with the Counte&s;s, but that
he mu&s;t leave no Stone unturn'd to pre|vent
her being carry'd into <HI>Holland:</HI> My
Lord being re&s;olved to embark with
her aboard the Yatch, the King intends
to &s;end to the <HI>Hague</HI> to the Duke of
<PB N="119" REF="109">
<HI>Newburg. E&s;ther</HI> came back &s;oon after
to the Counte&s;s, and the Nur&s;e acquit|ted
her &s;elf of her Commi&s;&s;ion with
much Dexterity. My Lord found me
out immediately, and we be&s;tow'd a
great part of the Night in Con&s;ultati|ons,
what was be&s;t to be done. When
we reflected upon the Earl's Quality,
and the Lady's Reputation, which we
were more tender of, than &s;he has been
of late her &s;elf, we could not determine
to proceed to any violent Re&s;olutions.
But I came this Morning to the Prince,
and told him what a <HI>dilemma</HI> I lay un|der;
He knowing me to have a peculiar
Talent at di&s;gui&s;ing my &s;elf, advi&s;ed
I&mdash;'Tis true, &s;aid the Prince, in|terrupting
him, you have &s;uch a pecu|liar
Gift of contriving Ma&s;querades,
that I can't forbear to relate to the Duke
of <HI>Monmouth,</HI> what happen'd betwixt
you (during our civil Trouble) and
<HI>Ireton</HI>'s Wife, becau&s;e it has in it &s;ome|thing
that is extraordinary divert|ing,
but by rea&s;on of my Illne&s;s, I
hope the Earl of S. <HI>Alb$ns,</HI> who knows
the whole Adventure better than my
&s;elf, will ea&s;e me of that trouble;
The Earl began thus:</P>
<P>The whole Kingdom was in a mo&s;t
terrible Combu&s;tion, and the King's
Servants were per&s;ecuted in all Places.
The Duke of <HI>Buckingham</HI> having taken
up Arms, in Conjunction with the Earls
<PB N="120" REF="110">
of <HI>Holland</HI> and <HI>Peterborough,</HI> they put
them&s;elves at the head of Five hun|dred
Hor&s;e, in hopes that by their Zeal
and Courage they might do &s;omething
for the King's Service. They were en|gaged
by Major <HI>Gibbons,</HI> near <HI>King&s;ton,</HI>
where the Brother of the Duke of <HI>Buck|ingham</HI>
lo&s;t his Life in the Flower of his
Age, being a Per&s;on highly accompli&s;h|ed
both in Body and Mind; His Death
cau&s;ed &s;uch a Con&s;ternation among his
Party, that they retreated, tho' in very
good Order, to <HI>King&s;ton.</HI> The next Day
they marched out again to S. <HI>Net,</HI> where
a &s;econd Engagement happening, the
Duke of <HI>Buckingham</HI> did Wonders, and
in the very prime of his Youth gave ear|ly
Proofs of his Valour and Conduct,
not inferiour to the brave&s;t and mo&s;t
experienc'd Captain of his Age. For|tune
had for a con&s;iderable time before,
declared it &s;elf again&s;t us, and it &s;eem'd,
that to fight for a good Cau&s;e, was &s;uf|ficient
to have the wor&s;t of it. The
Duke of <HI>Buckingham</HI> &s;eeing him&s;elf re|duced
to this Extremity, retreated to
<HI>Lincoln,</HI> with Sixty Hor&s;e only. The
Earl of <HI>Peterborough</HI> &s;aved him&s;elf by
Flight in the <HI>Netherlands,</HI> and the
Earl of <HI>Holland,</HI> with a great many
Officers and Per&s;ons of Note, were
taken Pri&s;oners, be&s;ides what remained
&s;lain in the Field. The Enemy now ha|ving
thought fit to treat them with
Lenity, in order to engage them in
<PB N="121" REF="111">
their Intere&s;t, or at lea&s;t, not to bare
Arms for the future, again&s;t what they
&s;tiled the Government. The Earl of
<HI>Holland</HI> being fir&s;t conducted to the
Ca&s;tle of <HI>Warwick,</HI> was afterwards con|fined
to his own Hou&s;e; and they ha|ving
&s;ome peculiar Re&s;pect for the Duke
of <HI>Buckingham,</HI> he had his Pardon offer'd
him, in regard e&s;pecially of his youth,
provided he would &s;urrender in
Fourteen Days, and acknowledge his
Fault. This Offer proving no wi&s;e agree|able
to a Per&s;on, who had an Aver&s;ion
to, and de&s;pi&s;ed tho&s;e who thought they
did him a &s;ignal piece of Service; he
rejected it, per&s;i&s;ting in his Re&s;olution
of doing the King what Service he could.
But con&s;idering, that, if he continued
in Arms, he &s;hould be &s;oon overpow|er'd
by the Enemies, &s;and perhaps fall
alive into their hands, he re&s;olved to
&s;helter him&s;elf in <HI>London,</HI> partly to &s;hew
his Intrepedity and Con&s;tancy, partly
there to gain and encourage as many as
he could to the King's Party.</P>
<P>At the &s;ame time, being re&s;olved not
to &s;hut him&s;elf up in &s;ome private
place or other (as another perhaps would
have done) he cau&s;ed him&s;elf to be
made a <HI>Jack-Pudding's</HI> Coat, a little
Hat, with a Fox's-Tail on it, and ador|ned
with Cock's Fethers: Sometimes
he appear'd in a Vizard Mask, &s;ome|times
he had his Face bedaub'd with
Flower, &s;ometimes with Lamb-black,
<PB N="122" REF="112">
according as the Fancy took him. He
had a Stage erected at <HI>Charing-Cro&s;s,</HI>
where he was attended by Violins and
Puppet-Players. Every Day he brought
forth new Ballads (of his own making)
upon what pa&s;s'd in Town, wherein he
him&s;elf often had a Share. The&s;e he
&s;ung before &s;everal thou&s;ands of Specta|tors,
who came every Day to &s;ee and
hear him. He al&s;o &s;old <HI>Mithridate,</HI> and
his <HI>Galbanum</HI> Plai&s;ter, and thus pa&s;s'd
away his Time in the greate&s;t Security,
in this great City, in the mid&s;t of his
Enemies, whil&s;t we were oblig'd to fly,
and to conceal our &s;elves in &s;ome Hole
or other.</P>
<P>The Dutche&s;s of <HI>Richmond</HI> his Si&s;ter,
was narrowly guarded ot <HI>White-Hall,</HI>
her Husband being then kept a Pri&s;o|ner
at <HI>Wind&s;or.</HI> The Duke of <HI>Bucking|ham</HI>
having got notice when &s;he was to
be carry'd thither, &s;et up his Stage that
Day, at a place where of nece&s;&s;ity &s;he
mu&s;t pa&s;s by (having &s;omething to &s;ay
to her, which concerned their joint In|tere&s;t)
which when &s;he did, he cry'd
out to the Mob, he intended to give
them a Song, made upon her and the
Duke of <HI>Buckingham.</HI> The Mob &s;topt
the Coach and the Dutche&s;s, the Guards
being willing enough to comply, be|cau&s;e
they were glad to &s;ee her affront|ed.
Nay, &s;o outragious were the Mob,
that they forced the Dutche&s;s, who was
then the hand&s;ome&s;t Woman in <HI>England,</HI>
<PB N="123" REF="113">
to &s;it in the Boot of the Coach, and to
hear him &s;ing all his impertinent Songs.
Having left off &s;inging, he told them,
'twas no more than rea&s;on he &s;hould
pre&s;ent the Dutche&s;s &s;ome of the Songs,
whereof &s;he was the main Subject, and
&s;o he comes down from his Stage, load|en
all over with Papers, and ridiculous
little Pictures: Being ju&s;t come to
the Coach, he took off a black piece of
Taffata, which he always wore over one
of his Eyes, and then his Si&s;ter di&s;co|vered
immediately who he was, yet &s;he
had &s;o much Pre&s;ence of Mind, as not
to give the lea&s;t &s;ign of Mi&s;tru&s;t, nay,
&s;he gave him &s;ome opprobious Language,
but was very eager of &s;natching at the
Papers he threw into her Coach, and
among them a Packet of Letters, which
&s;he had no &s;ooner got, but &s;he went for|ward,
the Duke at the head of the
Mob attending, and hollowing her a
good way out of the Town.</P>
<P>But in &s;pite of all this Di&s;gui&s;e, his
Shape appear'd &s;o exqui&s;itely fine, and
he danced on the Stage with &s;o good a
Grace, that <HI>Cromwell</HI>'s Daughter (&s;he who
was married to <HI>Ireton,</HI> one of the mo&s;t in|veterate
Enemies to the King) having
e&s;py'd him out of her Window upon
the Stage, took &s;uch a liking to him,
that &s;he &s;ent him word, &s;he wanted to
&s;peak with him. He was not in&s;en&s;i|ble
what Hazard he run, and how dif|ficult
it would be to avoid being di&s;co|vered;
<PB N="124" REF="114">
he remain'd uncertain for &s;ome
time, whether he ought thus to deliver
him&s;elf into the Hands of his Enemies,
and re&s;olved not to go. But after all,
his Courage, which was always an Ene|my
to Fear, over-ballancing all other
Reflections, he con&s;idered with him|&s;elf,
that, in ca&s;e he could enter in|to
an amorous Intreague with this La|dy,
he might by this means be let into
all the Secrets of her Husband, with|out
who&s;e Advice <HI>Cromwell</HI> &s;carce under|took
any thing of Moment. Upon this
Con&s;ideration, blaming his Prudence,
which he call'd un&s;ea&s;onable, he went
the &s;ame Night to the Lady. He had
changed his <HI>Jack-Pudding</HI>'s Dre&s;s, for
another very rich one, over which he
wore a Cloak; and he had once a mind
to have al&s;o taken of the Plai&s;ter; But
met with a more kind Reception, than
if he had had both his Eyes entire.
She gave him &s;uch undeniable proofs of
her Tenderne&s;s, that he was fully &s;atis|fy'd
he might without Danger tell her
his Name: But found &s;uch an Aver&s;ion
in him&s;elf to her Per&s;on, by rea&s;on of
her Father, that &s;he was alom&s;t in&s;up|portable
to him, and con&s;equently re|ceived
her Care&s;&s;es with &s;o much Cold|ne&s;s,
nay, even with Slight, as reduced her
almo&s;t to De&s;pair. At la&s;t, being urg|ed
for a con&s;iderable time to tell her
the Rea&s;on, he told her boldly, he was
a <HI>Jew,</HI> and by their Law forbidden not
<PB N="125" REF="115">
to love a Chri&s;tian Woman. She &s;tood
amazed, that a Man, who by his Pro|fe&s;&s;ion
was to cheat all the World upon
the Stage, &s;hould be &s;o &s;trait lac'd in
his Con&s;cience. As &s;he of her &s;elf was
not learned enough to confute his A&s;&s;er|tion
by Strength of Argument, &s;he
&s;ent for a famous <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Rabbi, and pro|mi&s;ed
him a good Reward. The Duke
coming that Night to pay her a Vi&s;it,
was not a little &s;urprized, when he &s;aw
this old grave Fellow come into the
Room, and to offer him, that he would
ea&s;ily remove this Scruple. The Duke
being not &s;o well ver&s;ed in the <HI>Talmuth,</HI> as
to enter into a Di&s;pute with the Rabbi,
had no other way left to get clear of
the matter, than to beg two Days
re&s;pite to con&s;ider of it. But now,
fearing in good earne&s;t to be di&s;covered,
he left <HI>London,</HI> and took his way to the
<HI>Downs.</HI> Ju&s;t before his departure, ha|ving
an Inclination to let <HI>Ireton</HI>'s Wife
know unto what Tribe the <HI>Jew</HI> (&s;he had
loved &s;o tenderly) belong'd, he &s;ent her
a Billet, written with that Vivacity of
Wit, which you know is natural to
him; I give you leave to gue&s;s at her
Surprize, and whether &s;he did not re|proach
her &s;elf a thou&s;and times, for
having betray'd the Secrets of her Fa|mily.</P>
<P>The Earl of S. <HI>Albans</HI> was ready to
die with laughing at this Pa&s;&s;age, unto
which the Prince added &s;everal par|ticulars,
<PB N="126" REF="116">
which the Earl had left out.
The Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI> reeurn'd them
Thanks for this mo&s;t diverting Relati|on

I mu&s;t confe&s;s, &s;aid the Duke

every thing to the be&s;t Advantage, and

a Trifle, he has been plea&s;ed to exagge|rate
every thing to my Prai&s;e, and tho'
his favourable Sentiments for me
are highly acceptable to me. I
mu&s;t after all frankly own, I never
heard any thing with more impatience
in my Life; and when I reflect, that
this account has prevented my going a|way,
I am ready to de&s;pair. I am ful|ly
re&s;olved, &s;aid he to the Dke of <HI>Mon|mouth,</HI>
to go in this Equipage you &s;ee
me in, aboard the Yatch that is ready
to &s;ail for <HI>Holland;</HI> I will go aboard her
in the Quality of a common Seaman,
I will make my &s;elf known to the
Counte&s;s, and will concert Mea&s;ures
with her, how to get her out of her
Husband's Hands. He will not in the
lea&s;t mi&s;tru&s;t me, and I may perhaps
meet with a happy Opportunity, be|fore
our arrival at the <HI>Briel;</HI> and were
it only for the plea&s;ure of &s;eeing her
during the Voyage, this will &s;ute much
better with my Inclination, than to
&s;tay behind without her.</P>
<P><PB N="127" REF="117">
I never &s;aw a more amorous Man in
the World than you are, &s;aid the Earl
of S. <HI>Albans,</HI> and I mu&s;t accu&s;e you of
Ingratitude, becau&s;e you have conceal|ed
from the Company, that it was I that
furni&s;hed you with the&s;e fine Seamens
Cloaths, under the Di&s;gui&s;e whereof
you are to perform &s;uch gallant amo|rous
Exploits. 'Tis true, &s;aid the Duke,
were I not &s;o eager to go, I would with
a great deal of Plea&s;ure make up Ac|counts
with you, and acknowledge my
Debts; But as the ca&s;e &s;tands now, I
mu&s;t either go immediately, or die upon
the Spot this Minute. At this the
Prince fell a laughing. Were you of
about Eighteen Years of Age, &s;aid he,
you ought to be excu&s;ed, but at &s;uch
an Age as ours, we &s;hould be Ma&s;ters of
a little more Moderation. You are free
to &s;ay what you plea&s;e, my Lord, an|&s;wered
the Duke, as to what concerns
my &s;elf, I hold this for a &s;ure Maxim,
That it is ea&s;ier to defend ones &s;elf a|gain&s;t
the A&s;&s;aults of Love, than to pre|&s;cribe
certain Bounds, after one loves.
Love being a Child, is an Enemy to
the&s;e Rules of Wi&s;dom, you would
maliciou&s;ly in&s;inuate into me.</P>
<P>The Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI> having in
the mean while withdrawn him&s;elf with
the Earl of S. <HI>Albans,</HI> into a &s;pacious
Dining-Room, called the <HI>Room of Plea|&s;ure,</HI>
by rea&s;on of the fine Paintings
that were to be &s;een there, and that
<PB N="128" REF="118">
the Prince u&s;ed to entertain and fea&s;t
his Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es in it. 'Tis certain, that
all the remainder of this Day, the Duke
of <HI>Monmouth</HI> was afflicted with the mo&s;t
heavy Inquietudes, after having receiv|ed
po&s;itive and mo&s;t &s;incere A&s;&s;urances
from the Earl of S. <HI>Albans,</HI> concerning
what the Earl of <HI>A&mdash;n</HI> had entru&s;t|ed
him with, in reference to <HI>Emilia.</HI>
Now it was that the Duke thought him|&s;elf
all along in an Error, to believe
&s;he loved none but him. Oh! &s;aid he,
the la&s;t is always the mo&s;t happy with
her, and how ea&s;ie is a Man, who &s;ets
up for Con&s;tancy, made a Bubble off.
He exclaim'd again&s;t the whole Sex in
general, and be&s;tow'd a Thou&s;and Cur&s;|es
upon his Mi&s;tre&s;s in particular. Whil&s;t
he was bemoaning his Misfortunes, the
Earl of S. <HI>Albans</HI> was very attentive in
hearing a Canary-Bird &s;ing; The Duke
looking upon him for &s;ome time, with|out
&s;peaking one Word, Yes, &s;aid he,
I could find in my Heart to kill you,
you Canary-Bird, and all the World be|&s;ide;
for is it po&s;&s;ible that &s;o polite a
Man as you are (&s;uppo&s;ing you were
none of my Friend, as I don't &s;uppo&s;e
you are) is it po&s;&s;ible, &s;ay I, you &s;hould
not have &s;o much Complai&s;ance, as to
bare a Share in my Affliction and Re|&s;entment.
I have kept no Tears in re|&s;erve,
reply'd the Earl &s;miling, having
&s;hed them all before on account of my
own Misfortunes; and I have bought
<PB N="129" REF="119">
Love at &s;o dear a rate, that all your
Pains taken together, can't &s;tand in
Competition with the lea&s;t I have &s;uf|fered.
Oh! cry'd the Duke, you are
ungrateful to complain; your Suffe|rings
were recompenced by &s;uch &s;ecret
Enjoyments, as can't be purcha&s;ed at
too high a $ price. I have &s;een the
Draught of the old Court, and know
every thing that pa&s;s'd, in re&s;pect to
you, and have been concern'd in your
behalf; but how well you de&s;erve it,
I judge by the mo&s;t gracious Returns
you are plea&s;ed to make me. The Earl
bur&s;t out a laughing &s;o loud, that being
heard by the Prince, and the Duke of
<HI>Buckingham,</HI> they begg'd them to return
to their Conver&s;ation. But the Duke of
<HI>Monmouth</HI> de&s;ired the Earl to ask his
Excu&s;e with the Prince, and &s;o he was
going down Stairs without &s;aying any
thing, except, that, in the Humour he
was then in, he was good for nothing,
except it were to kill <HI>Emilia.</HI> Now, I
expect, return'd the Earl, you will turn
the De&s;troyer of Human Race. 'Tis
not above a moment ago when you were
for killing even the poor Canary-Bird,
it will prove a hard matter for one to
e&s;cape your Fury. Adieu, &s;aid the
Duke, you talk at Plea&s;ure, have a care
it may not be my turn another day.</P>
<P>He went away in great ha&s;t, but was
&s;carce come to the bottom of the Stairs,
when &s;eeing the King come in, he
<PB N="130" REF="120">
was obliged to conduct him up Stairs,
and the Duke under&s;tanding that the
King was coming, would fain have
been gone. The Prince told him, that
if he would go into his Clo&s;et, he might
from thence go down a pair of back
Stairs, to another Apartment; but
when he came into the Clo&s;et, he could
find no other Door there, than that,
thro' which he came in; the Prince ha|ving
contriv'd this Stratagem on pur|po&s;e
to make him to &s;tay there till he
could &s;hew him to the King in his Sea|man's
Di&s;gui&s;e.</P>
<P>The King came in laughing, follow'd
only by the Duke of <HI>Monmouth.</HI> I am
come, &s;aid he to the Prince, to tell you
a very plea&s;ant Story: You know, that
&s;ince the di&s;covery of the late Con&s;pi|racy,
I &s;ent Orders to the Sea-Ports,
not to &s;uffer any one to go be|yond
Seas, without a Pa&s;s, Sign'd by
my own Hand. One of my Yachts be|ing
ready to &s;et &s;ail for <HI>Holland,</HI> whi|ther
I &s;ent it to the Prince of <HI>Newburg,</HI>
the Earl of&mdash;with his Lady, (who
appear'd extreamly melancholly) would
fain have embark'd aboard her; he de|&s;ired
the Captain to tran&s;port them to
<HI>Holland,</HI> but he &s;hewing &s;ome unwilling|ne&s;s,
offers him a great Summ of Money.
The Captain now beginning to &s;u&s;pect
them, and thinking there was &s;omething
more than ordinary in the matter, not on|ly
refu&s;es them Pa&s;&s;age, but al&s;o cau&s;es
<PB N="131" REF="121">
him and his Wife to be &s;eized, and is
come to give me an Account of the
matter. I give you leave to gue&s;s in what
a Condition the poor jealous Husband is
by this time. The Prince then asking
the King what Re&s;olution he had taken
in that Affair? I have re&s;olved, &s;aid he,
to let them go where they will: His
Counte&s;s is very hand&s;ome in my Eyes,
but &s;he &s;hews not the lea&s;t Acknow|ledgment
of my Favours, nay, &s;he
has not thought it worth her while, to
crave my A&s;&s;i&s;tance, and &s;o I will not
intermeddle in the Bu&s;ine&s;s. The Duke
of <HI>Buckingham</HI> overheard what the King
&s;aid, and being now no more Ma&s;ter of
his Pa&s;&s;ion, out of the Clo&s;et he comes,
and throws him&s;elf at the King's Feet.
The King looking upon him, but with|out
knowing him, &s;aid, Friend, <HI>what
would&s;t thou have?</HI> The Duke, who
had forgot his Di&s;gui&s;e, and who u&s;ed
to be treated by the King in the &s;ame fa|miliar
way, reply'd, What I would
have, Sir? Alas! can't you ea&s;ily think
of it, knowing, as you actually do, my
Pa&s;&s;ion for the Counte&s;s of&mdash;I would
you &s;hould re&s;tore her to me. To thee,
cry'd the King, laughing, to thee,
Friend. Yes Sir, to my &s;elf, reply'd
the Duke, I will give you back all my
Employments and other Favours, pro|vided
you will grant me this Reque&s;t.
Certainly the Man is out of his Sen&s;es,
continued the King, he will give me
<PB N="132" REF="122">
back all his Offices and other Favours,
and where are they? The Prince, the
Duke of <HI>Monmouth,</HI> and the Earl of
S. <HI>Albans,</HI> laugh'd heartily, and the
Duke of <HI>Buckingham</HI> could not forbare
to do the &s;ame, &s;o &s;oon as he began to
think of his Di&s;gui&s;e, and that the King
did not know him. Then the Prince
unfolded the Riddle to the King, who
was extreamly plea&s;ed with it. Here is
a Story, &s;aid he, which would &s;carce be
pardonable in a very young Man; but
to meet with it in your Per&s;on, cer|tainly
it is impo&s;&s;ible. However, I in|tend
to &s;end to the Earl of&mdash;that I
want to &s;peak with him, and I will actu|ally
&s;peak to him concerning his Wife,
that &s;he may meet with better Treat|ment
from him for the future, becau&s;e
there is not one in&s;tance of &s;uch a &s;evere
U&s;age in the whole Court, be&s;ides this.
But, Sir, &s;aid the Duke of <HI>Buckingham,</HI>
are you likely to continue my Rival;
for, I rather wi&s;h the Counte&s;s in <HI>Hol|land,</HI>
than to have to do with you in
that kind. Hitherto, &s;aid the King, I
never &s;aw you much di&s;turbed upon
that Account, and I am not unacquain|ted
in &s;ome mea&s;ure, with what Game
you have play'd me; but let us now
think of bringing back the Lady, and
afterwards &s;ettle our Preten&s;ions. He
ordered the Earl of S. <HI>Albans</HI> to write
immediately to the Earl of&mdash;in his
Name, and the &s;aid Earl appearing ac|cordingly
<PB N="133" REF="123">
the &s;ame Night at <HI>Whitehall,</HI>
the King &s;poke to him in &s;o obliging a
manner, and gave him &s;uch whole&s;ome
Advice, tending to his own Repo&s;e,
and the maintaining of his Wife's Re|putation,
that any body el&s;e but him|&s;elf
would have embraced it.</P>
<P>The Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI> was too much
di&s;turbed with Jealou&s;y and Vexation to
&s;tay long at the Princes; but went
thence to my Lady&mdash;She &s;oon percei|ved
by his Countenance, that he had
been with the Earl of S. <HI>Albans,</HI> and
that by him he had been fully convin|ced
of what he would have been over|joy'd
to remain in doubt of. Well, my
Lord, &s;aid &s;he to him, I &s;uppo&s;e you
will believe me another time; and will
not &s;uppo&s;e I frame Stories on purpo&s;e
to impo&s;e upon <HI>Emilia,</HI> to withdraw you
from your Engagements to her. And I
think you mu&s;t be not very well in
your right Sen&s;es to di&s;pence &s;o patient|ly
with all her $oqueteries. Oh!
good God, Madam, &s;aid he to her,
don't in&s;ult over my Misfortunes,
you &s;ee I have more already than I am
able to bear, and you are endeavouring
to load me with new ones. You mi|&s;take
me, reply'd &s;he, you have no
&s;uch great occa&s;ion to complain, as you
imagine; a certain very amiable Per|&s;on,
loves you to &s;uch a degree; as may
well make an amends for the Lo&s;s of
<HI>Emilia.</HI> The Duke was not exempted
<PB N="134" REF="124">
from that Fault, incident to mo&s;t Peo|ple
of his Age: He would not let &s;lip
the lea&s;t Opportunity of Gallantry; he
always entertain'd the predominant
Pa&s;&s;ion in his Heart, but look'd upon
the re&s;t as Amu&s;ements, not to be
neglected. He fancy'd that my Lady
&mdash;was &s;peaking in her own behalf;
and that having taken a Pique again&s;t
the Earl of <HI>A&mdash;n,</HI> &s;he intended to
make her Addre&s;&s;es to him, and judged it
but rea&s;onable &s;he &s;hould thus make
her &s;elf an amends for the di&s;quiet oc|ca&s;ioned
by her Lover. This Reflection
revived all his Vivacity of Mind; I am
beloved, Madam, &s;aid he to her, and
&s;he that loves me is amiable. This is
very happy for me; but methinks &s;he
was not much in the right to pitch upon
&s;o dangerous a Confident as you are.
'Twas by chance, and not her Inclina|tion,
that made me Mi&s;tre&s;s of this
Secret, &s;aid my Lady&mdash;, and, becau&s;e
I won't let your Imagination rove too
far to gue&s;s at it, I will tell you, it is
<HI>Philadelphia, Emilia</HI>'s Companion, with
whom you always quarrel about her
Langui&s;hments. The Duke &s;tood &s;ur|prized
at this Name, and this News
proved very agreeable to him. <HI>Phila|delphia</HI>
was hand&s;ome and young, her
Deportment was more &s;edate, and not
&s;o un&s;ettled as that of <HI>Emilia,</HI> and ex|treamly
plea&s;ing to the Duke; be&s;ides
that, having always &s;hown an Indiffe|rency
<PB N="135" REF="125">
for all the World, the Duke was
vain enough to flatter him&s;elf, that &s;he
preferr'd him before all the re&s;t. He
took particular care to know all what
my Lady&mdash;knew of the matter, who
communicated to him the whole Ad|venture
of the Billet &s;he left in the
Clo&s;et. 'Tis po&s;&s;ible, that without the
Spite he then had conceived again&s;t <HI>Emi|lia,</HI>
he would not have been &s;en&s;ible, in
&s;o eminent a degree, of the plea&s;ure of
being beloved by <HI>Philadelphia;</HI> But now
he was &s;o far from checking this new
Pa&s;&s;ion, that he favoured and admitted
it into his Heart, the &s;ooner to cure
that which he had had for an ungrateful
Per&s;on.</P>
<P>He thank'd my Lady&mdash;for the good
News &s;he had brought him; and in the
Evening went to the Dutche&s;s of&mdash;,
who was pretty well recovered by this
time. Pa&s;&s;ing thro' the Guard-Cham|ber,
he met <HI>Emilia,</HI> &s;topping a little, as
if &s;he had a mind to &s;peak to him&punc;
But the Duke pulling of his Hat with a
carele&s;s Air, pa&s;s'd by her without as
much as ca&s;ting one Eye at her; After|wards,
e&s;pying <HI>Philadelphia</HI> in the Anti|chamber,
he accoa&s;ted her in mo&s;t o|bliging
and graceful manner, which had
in it &s;omething more than ordinary.
<HI>Emilia</HI> was much &s;urprized at the Duke's
Deportment towards her; She could
not but look upon this hard U&s;age, as
a very &s;lender recompence for what
<PB N="136" REF="126">
lo&s;s &s;he had &s;u&s;tained by my Lady&mdash;
in her Reputation, and the Affront
put upon her, when &s;he threw the <HI>Inck</HI>-Bottle
in her Face. She was certain
&s;he had nothing to reproach her &s;elf
with for what &s;he had told the Earl of
<HI>A&mdash;n,</HI> &s;ince it was done by the con|&s;ent
of the Duke of <HI>Monmouth,</HI> with an
Intention to keep him on in Ignorance.</P>
<P>All the&s;e Reflections made him ap|pear
over burthen'd, with &s;o much
guilt in her Eyes, that &s;he reproach'd
her &s;elf a thou&s;and times for her Frail|ties,
&s;he did not care to return into
the Room, where &s;he could expect to
meet with nothing el&s;e but with fre&s;h
Vexation from the Duke, and fearing
lea&s;t her Di&s;&s;atisfaction might di&s;cover
it &s;elf in her Face, &s;he cho&s;e rather to
go to her Chamber, to afford a free
Cour&s;e to her Tears. In the mean
while, <HI>Philadelphia</HI> was not a little a&s;ha|med
of having di&s;covered her Senti|ments
for the Duke of <HI>Monmouth,</HI> in
the Letter found by my Lady&mdash;and
<HI>Emilia</HI> in the Clo&s;et; &s;ometimes &s;he
flatter'd her &s;elf, that my Lady&mdash;
gue&s;&s;iing it might be for him, had not
mention'd it; tho' in a moment after,
&s;he wi&s;h'd they had di&s;covered it to
him. She appear'd very pen&s;ive and
di&s;turbed, &s;he dur&s;t not look upon him,
and her Fear had rai&s;ed her Colour in
her Face, whil&s;t &s;he kept her Eyes
fixt on the Ground. As &s;he &s;carce re|turn'd
<PB N="137" REF="127">
an An&s;wer to &s;uch indifferent
Que&s;tions, as had nothing in them that
could either puzzle or &s;urprize her, he
began to gue&s;s at the pre&s;ent Condition
of her Heart, and rightly judging that
he ought not to let &s;lip &s;o favourable a
minute without improving it, he told
her how far &s;he had the Pre-eminency
in her Heart, before <HI>Emilia,</HI> when &s;e|veral
Ladies coming in, &s;he entred into
a Di&s;cour&s;e with them to recover her
&s;elf from that Surprize, which the Duke
of <HI>Monmouth</HI>'s Declaration had occa&s;i|oned
in her.</P>
<P>She returned to the Dutche&s;s of&mdash;'<HI>s</HI>
Apartment, the Duke follow'd her, and
looking upon her with a mo&s;t tender
Air, &s;he had &s;o little Power of forbear|ing
to return his Looks, that &s;he her
&s;elf was afraid &s;he had di&s;covered to
the World a Secret, &s;he intended to
conceal to the utmo&s;t; &s;o that rather
than to expo&s;e her &s;elf to this Mi&s;hap,
&s;he thought it be&s;t to retire. The Duke,
who narrowly ob&s;erved her, rightly
gue&s;&s;ing at the matter, re&s;olved to fol|low
her, and to tell her all the tender
and obliging things in the World. Af|ter
having &s;taid a little while longer in
the Dutche&s;s of&mdash;'s Apartment, he
went to that of the Ladies of Honour,
and tho' few Men were &s;uffered to
come there, yet the Duke was not ty'd
to all the ordinary Cu&s;toms. He was
&s;urpriz'd when he came in, not to &s;ee
<PB N="138" REF="128">
<HI>Philadelphia,</HI> but to meet with <HI>Emilia,</HI>
her Eyes red, and her Cheeks overflown
with Tears; &s;he no &s;ooner &s;aw him, but
aro&s;e from her Seat, and without
&s;peaking one word, went into her Clo|&s;et,
the Door whereof &s;he was going to
&s;hut after her. But he accoa&s;ting her
at that minute, Do you imagine, &s;aid
he, <HI>Emilia,</HI> I have not been &s;ufficiently
inform'd of what occa&s;ions of Com|plaint
you have given me? Will you
augment them by the addition of
others, and by &s;hewing me your Di&s;|dain,
which, to &s;peak the truth, be|comes
you but very ill. Your Re|proaches,
&s;aid &s;he, might perhaps &s;ur|prize
me at another time, but don't at
this Juncture, becau&s;e I know you to
be the mo&s;t ungrateful of all Men; and
I &s;hould be too happy, had I given you
any real cau&s;e of Vexation; but my
Dealings with you have been too full
of Sincerity. I did &s;acrifice the Earl of
<HI>A&mdash;n</HI> for you, I have born with Pa|tience
your Indi&s;cretion, in giving my
Lady&mdash;a &s;hare in my Secret; She has
in&s;ulted over me, as if my Birth was
inferiour to hers, and nothing but the
Advantage &s;he had got over me, by
your Imprudence, could have made her
take that Liberty. Sen&s;ible to the high|e&s;t
Degree of this Affront, as indeed I
ought to be, I flatter'd my &s;elf you
would endeavour to afford me &s;ome
Con&s;olation; I intended to tell you my
<PB N="139" REF="129">
Grief, and to make you &s;en&s;ible of my
Afflictions, when you happening to
meet me, you look'd upon me with a
haughty and proud Air, &s;carce to be
expre&s;s'd, and now you come to tri|umph
over my Weakne&s;s and Pains I
&s;uffer for you. Her Reproaches and
Tears, were undeniable Signs to the
Duke, that &s;he was touched to the
Heart; for he &s;till loved her, and <HI>Phi|ladelphia</HI>
had not as yet got &s;o far Po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion
of his Heart, as to have been
able to cha&s;e thence her Rival, in &s;o
little a time. May it plea&s;e Heaven,
&s;aid he, with a mo&s;t tender and agree|able
Look, may it plea&s;e Heaven you
give no matter of Satisfaction to any
body el&s;e but my &s;elf: But the Earl of
<HI>A&mdash;n</HI> thinks him&s;elf too happy for me
to pretend to the &s;ame good Fortune.
You love us by Turns, I was happy la&s;t
Night, and &s;o was he this Morning, and
&mdash;don't go on in &s;o di&s;obliging a
Di&s;cour&s;e, cry'd &s;he, ungrateful as you
are, you will rai&s;e my Pa&s;&s;ion to the
highe&s;t Pitch. Have you forgot alrea|dy,
that what I have &s;aid to the Earl,
was done according to your Advice,
after I frankly offered quite to break off
with him; that you were afraid, this
Rupture might make a Noi&s;e which
might reach the Ears of the Dutche&s;s
of&mdash;, who being ignorant of our
Corre&s;pondence, you conjur'd me to
take this Method for your Quiet, and
<PB N="140" REF="130">
that upon that &s;core you would be more
obliged to me, than upon any other
Account whatever. But let us talk no
more of it, continued &s;he, falling down
into her Chair, let us &s;ay no more of
it. I would have you believe I betray
and hate you, I would have you imagine
every thing that may rai&s;e your Anger
again&s;t me, I prefer your Aver&s;ion be|fore
your Tenderne&s;s, and before the
Misfortune of plea&s;ing you.</P>
<P>The Vioience wherewith &s;he uttered
the&s;e Complaints and Reproaches, her
Eyes burning with Anger, the Colour
of her Face, her Youth and Beauty, all
the&s;e I &s;ay, pleaded in her behalf, &s;o
that the Duke, now quite pierc'd thro'
with Love, threw him&s;elf at her Feet:
What did he not &s;ay to appea&s;e her?
She &s;eem'd not to hearken to his Prote|&s;tations,
which &s;erving only to highten
his Pa&s;&s;ion, he declared he would either
be Friends with <HI>Emilia,</HI> or die before
he left her. At the &s;ame moment <HI>Phi|ladelphia</HI>
returning from the Apartment
of the Prince&s;s&mdash;, entred the Room.
She had all this while plea&s;ed her &s;elf
with the &s;ecret Thoughts of the Duke
of <HI>Monmouth</HI>'s Affection. She thought
her &s;elf already triumphant over a
Heart, the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion whereof was her
only aim, &s;he upbraided her &s;elf for
having left &s;o &s;oon the Dutche&s;s of
&mdash;'s Apartment, whil&s;t the Duke
&s;taid behind. But alas! alas! gue&s;s at
<PB N="141" REF="131">
her Surprize, when &s;he &s;aw the Duke
at the Feet of her Rival. Never was
&s;uch a Conte&s;t &s;een betwixt <HI>Love, Jea|lou&s;ie,</HI>
and <HI>Pride;</HI> &s;he was in an In&s;tant
reduced from the highe&s;t pitch of Satisfa|ction,
to the highe&s;t degree of Pain;
&s;he look'd pale, &s;he &s;tood mute, and
by her Silence and want of Motion,
you would have taken her for nothing
el&s;e but a Statue, had not her Eyes,
which pre&s;erv'd &s;till their natural Fun|ction,
&s;ufficiently di&s;covered &s;ometimes
by their lively, &s;ometimes by their
langui&s;hing Motions, the different
Pa&s;&s;ions and Agitations of her Soul:
But all on a &s;udden, her Heart begin|ning
to fail, &s;he was ready to drop down,
when the Duke, who drew nearer to
her, catch'd her in his Arms.</P>
<P>O with what Plea&s;ure undertook he
this task! He &s;aw this lovely, young
and hand&s;ome Lady, dying for Jealou|&s;y,
whereof he was the Cau&s;e; and now
was &s;o convinced in him&s;elf, that there
was not the lea&s;t room left to doubt,
but that he was beloved to the highe&s;t
degree. His Gratitude and former In|clinations
being now join'd in the&s;e two
Per&s;ons, both pleaded hard to give the
preference to <HI>Philadelphia</HI> before <HI>Emilia,</HI>
or at lea&s;t he wi&s;h'd he could &s;hare his
Heart betwixt them, without affording
matter of Offence to either; but a Mi|&s;tre&s;s,
who knows the Niceties of Love,
will never be contented with &s;uch a
<PB N="142" REF="132">
&s;ort of Partition. Whil&s;t he was bu&s;i|ed
in giving all po&s;&s;ible A&s;&s;i&s;tance to
this fair Lady, <HI>Emilia</HI> ob&s;erved all their
Actions, without vouch&s;afing to come
near her Companion; for, looking upon
her as a mo&s;t dangerous Rival, &s;he had
conceived a mo&s;t &s;trong Aver&s;ion again&s;t
her. Neither dur&s;t the Duke urge her
to lend a helping Hand, for fear of di&s;|obliging,
and affording fre&s;h matter
of Complaint to her, at a Juncture,
when this la&s;t Conte&s;t was &s;till fre&s;h in
Memory: However, at la&s;t, his Com|pa&s;&s;ion
prevailing above his Policy, Is
it po&s;&s;ible, &s;aid he, you &s;hould &s;ee <HI>Phi|ladelphia</HI>
in this Condition, and not think
of &s;ome Remedy or other to recover
her out of this Swoon? What would
you have me to do, reply'd &s;he, my
Lord? You are a better Phy&s;ician than
I. At lea&s;t, &s;aid he, you might throw
a little cold Water in her Face. There
is none here, an&s;wered <HI>Emilia</HI> with a
grave and cold Air: You might go to
fetch &s;ome, added the Duke, this being
no more than an incumbent Duty, to
be performed one to another. I owe
her no Duty, &s;aid &s;he, and you will
find it difficult to per&s;wade me to leave
you together. The Duke, &s;omewhat
vexed at this Expre&s;&s;ion, Well, &s;aid he,
&s;ince you refu&s;e to give aid to <HI>Philadel|phia,</HI>
I &s;hall apply a Remedy, &s;uch as
Phy&s;icians like my &s;elf commonly make
u&s;e of; and &s;o gave her a hearty Ki&s;s!
<PB N="143" REF="133">
How! before my Face, cry'd <HI>Emilia,</HI>
endeavouring to pull <HI>Philadelphia</HI> out of
the Duke's Arms. Yes, cruel Woman,
&s;aid he, before your Face: What a
ble&s;&s;ed time have I on't, to be engaged
with a Per&s;on that has &s;o little Com|plai&s;ance
for me. They would have
gone farther in reproaching one another,
but that <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> being now come to
her&s;elf again, and opening her Eyes, &s;aw
the Duke rubbing her Hands with &s;ome
of the Queen of <HI>Hungary</HI>'s Water. O, my
Lord, &s;aid &s;he, pu&s;hing him from her,
let me alone I be&s;eech you, all what
comes from you, is like Poi&s;on to me,
and &s;o &s;he turn'd another way, to avoid
looking upon him.</P>
<P>The Duke being fen&s;ible the cau&s;e
of her Anger proceeded from no|thing
el&s;e, but his lying at the Feet of
<HI>Emilia,</HI> was &s;urprized to find, &s;he &s;hould
imagine to have already got &s;o firm a
footing in his Heart, as to treat him in
that manner as &s;he did. He &s;aw him&s;elf
betwixt the&s;e two young Ladies, belo|ved
by both, and upon the point of lo|&s;ing
them out of Jealou&s;y. He dur&s;t
not di&s;cover too much of his Inclinati|ons
for <HI>Philadelphia;</HI> and yet being un|willing
to appear indifferent, he was
&s;trangely divided in his Re&s;olution; So
that the hight of his good Fortune at
this Juncture, proved the wor&s;t of h$
Misfortune. Whil&s;t he was con&s;idering
of the mo&s;t proper Methods to appea&s;e
<PB N="144" REF="134">
both his Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es, they ca&s;t mo&s;t fu|rious
Looks at one another, and their
&s;ullen Silence di&s;covered &s;omething
more violent in their Hearts, than all
the injurious Words they could have
made u&s;e of. The Duke looking upon
this Conjuncture, as the mo&s;t terrible
he ever yet &s;aw in his Life, was under
a perplexity what to &s;ay to one, with|out
exa&s;perating the other, he would
fain have kept an even Hand betwixt
them, being unwilling to part with ei|ther,
but they had too much Sen&s;e,
and were too nearly concerned in the
matter, not to gue&s;s at his Thoughts;
Their Vanity and Self-Intere&s;t would
not &s;uffer them to brook &s;uch a Parti|tion.
<HI>Emilia,</HI> who had been beloved
fir&s;t, did not &s;uffer, but with the ut|mo&s;t
Impatience, the Concern the Duke
had &s;hewn for her Rival, &s;he was ju&s;t
upon the point of breaking out into the
mo&s;t bitter Reproaches commonly made
u&s;e of by Lovers upon &s;uch like Occa|&s;ions,
when they under&s;tood the Go|verne&s;s
was a coming towards their A|partment.
Her Severity proved the
mo&s;t powerful Motive of Union betwixt
the&s;e two Rivals, who now began to
concert Mea&s;ures how to divert the im|pending
Storm. We are in&s;allibly un|done,
cry'd they, my Lord, unle&s;s
you take care of our Reputation. What
would you have me do, &s;aid he; You
mu&s;t, reply'd <HI>Emilia,</HI> hide your &s;elf in
<PB N="145" REF="135">
the Clo&s;et, and we will take care to let
you out privately, he con&s;ented, went
in; They lock'd the Door and took out
the Key.</P>
<P>The Governe&s;s came in immediately
after, and finding her &s;elf &s;omewhat
out of order, would needs be undre&s;s'd,
and &s;up in her own Room; and there
being no Pa&s;&s;age out of the Apartment
of the Ladies of Honour, but thro' hers,
<HI>Philadelphia</HI> and <HI>Emilia</HI> were equally
concern'd at this Di&s;appointment, and to
add to their Di&s;&s;atisfaction, &s;he would
needs walk after Supper in their Apart|ment;
They were ready to die of Fear,
le&s;s the Duke &s;hould make the lea&s;t
Noi&s;e. In &s;hort, every Minute appear|ed
to them no le&s;s than an Age, and
the Duke you may &s;uppo&s;e, was not
very fond of his Quarters, being to
&s;up with my Lord <HI>Grey</HI> that Evening,
Madam&mdash;was the only Daughter
to the Earl of&mdash;Gentleman of the
Bed-Chamber to the King, her Mother
being a Lady of extraordinary Qualifi|cations,
and Lady of the Bed-Chamber
to the Queen. This young Lady, where|in
Youth and Beauty flouri&s;h'd in a
mo&s;t eminent degree, was beloved by
all that &s;aw her, and being of a very
gay Di&s;po&s;ition, &s;he &s;eldom u&s;ed to
frighten away her Lovers with her
Looks. She had marry'd a certain
Gentleman, much inferiour to her in
$word$ and but of an indifferent E&s;tate,
<PB N="146" REF="136">
which being done again&s;t her Father's
Con&s;ent, he would not &s;ee her, nor &s;uf|fer
her to come into his Hou&s;e, but at
the &s;ame time gave her a hand&s;ome
Yearly Allowance, &s;uitable to her Edu|cation.
This lovely Lady, coming fre|quently
to Court, the Duke of <HI>Mon|mouth</HI>
fell in Love with her, and &s;he
gave a favourable Ear to his Addre&s;&s;es.
The King's Favour, and his high Sta|tion,
being things &s;uitable to her Vani|ty,
&s;he was very ambitious to enter in|to
an Engagement with him, which &s;he
did &s;o effectually on her &s;ide, that &s;he
loved him more, than was con&s;i&s;tent
with her Repo&s;e. This Intreague has
been broken off and revived &s;everal
times. Perhaps I may give you &s;ome
Particulars thereof hereafter.</P>
<P>But not to interrupt our former Re|lation,
it will be &s;ufficient to tell you,
that &s;he and the Governe&s;s of the La|dies
of Honour of the Dutche&s;s of&mdash;
were mo&s;t intimate Friends, and that
they loved to &s;it up &s;o late in the Night,
that they often &s;lept all the Day-time
till Evening, in the Governe&s;s's Apart|ment;
She told her &s;he &s;hould not won|der
at her being not very well, becau&s;e
they had not &s;at up together for the&s;e
&s;everal Days la&s;t pa&s;t; and that &s;he
was re&s;olved not to &s;tir out of her
Room till &s;ix of the Clock the next
Morning. The Governe&s;s readily ac|cepted
the Challenge, and told her &s;he
<PB N="147" REF="137">
had too much Charity, not to be
aiding in the Recovery of her Health,
tho' with the lo&s;s of her own Repo&s;e;
That indeed &s;he found &s;he wanted
&s;omething, but had not Sagacity enough
to gue&s;s, &s;he wanted to pa&s;s a whole
Night with her in Conver&s;ation, and
that &s;he had a thou&s;and things to tell
her. They began immediately to en|tertain
one another with variety of
Matters, whil&s;t <HI>Emilia</HI> and <HI>Philadelphia</HI>
were almo&s;t reduced to De&s;pair, at this
new Ob&s;tacle. The Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI>
overheard all they &s;aid, he hoped to
get out of the Clo&s;et, &s;o &s;oon as the Go|verne&s;s
was gone to Bed: Being without
a Light, he could neither read nor write,
and the Moon being not up as yet, the
Darkne&s;s of the Night proved an addi|tional
encrea&s;e to his Vexation. They
&s;upp'd, and afterwards Madam&mdash;went
along with the Governe&s;s into her Cham|ber,
leaving <HI>Emilia</HI> and <HI>Philadelphia</HI> by
them&s;elves, every one fitting in their
Chair, with their Eyes fix'd on the
Ground, and without uttering one
Word; <HI>Emilia</HI> &s;tanding upon her Pun|ctilio's,
would not be the fir&s;t that would
go into the Clo&s;et to the Duke, tho'
they were both equally concerned, and
never did two Rivals meet with &s;uch a
Di&s;appointment together. The Duke
finding every thing very quiet, thought
no otherwi&s;e than that they intended to
game him, and let him &s;tay all Night in
<PB N="148" REF="138">
the Clo&s;et, he open'd the Door, and
found them all in Silence, as if they
did not think it worth their while to
&s;peak to him. They had commanded
their Waiting-Woman not to come in,
unle&s;s they were call'd, and they were
in &s;o deep a Study, that had it not been
for the Noi&s;e the Duke made, they
would que&s;tionle&s;s have continued in
the &s;ame Po&s;ture all Night. Is it thus,
&s;aid he, with a low Voice, you play
your Game with me? And do you
think I will &s;tay longer in the Clo&s;et?
If I mu&s;t &s;tay there for your &s;ake, pray
come in and keep me Company; or if
you won't do &s;o, find out a way to let
me go, for this &s;olitary Place does not
agree with my Con&s;titution. He &s;poke
the&s;e Words with &s;o haughty an Air,
that they &s;oon perceived he was very ill
&s;atisfy'd with his Quarters, each of
them would willingly have &s;poken to
him in private, but there needed no
more to have &s;et the whole Hou&s;e in|to
Combu&s;tion; &s;ince &s;he that had been
left alone, would infallibly have given
notice thereof to the Governe&s;s, let
the Con&s;equence be what it would, &s;o
neither of them an&s;wered one word;
This made him tell them with &s;ome
Pa&s;&s;ion, &s;ince they could think of no
Expedient, he would find out one him|&s;elf,
and &s;o moved towards the Door, as
if he was going out, tho' in reality he
de&s;ign'd no &s;uch thing, for it was enough
<PB N="149" REF="139">
for him to know, that Madam&mdash;
was in the Governe&s;s's Room, to &s;tand
upon his Guard, for fear of being &s;een
by her.</P>
<P>The two young Ladies, frightned at
his pretended Re&s;olution, Oh! my Lord,
cry'd they, you intend to ruin us out of
Sport; and &s;o <HI>Emilia</HI> pu&s;h'd him back
into the Clo&s;et, but too late; for the
Door betwixt the Appartment of the
young Ladies and that of the Gover|ne&s;s,
being half open, and the Moon
being ri&s;en by this time, Madam&mdash;
who happen'd to look that way, e&s;py'd
the Shadow of the Duke. She was not
&s;o deeply engaged in Di&s;cour&s;e with the
Governe&s;s, but that &s;he found her &s;elf
almo&s;t di&s;tracted with &s;o &s;urprizing a
Sight; but being at this time Mi&s;tre&s;s
of her Pa&s;&s;ion, &s;he &s;aid nothing, but
looking only once more towards the
Apartment of the young Ladies.
plainly di&s;covered her unfaithful Lover.
A thou&s;and times &s;he was in a mind
to divulge it; a thou&s;and confu&s;ed
Thoughts, and a thou&s;and uncertain
Re&s;olutions pre&s;ented them&s;elves to
her, &s;he rejected &s;ometimes one thing,
and &s;he approved the other, but with|out
any &s;table Re&s;olution; &s;he feared to
offend the Duke of <HI>Monmouth,</HI> in ca&s;e
&s;he &s;hould catch him in his amorous In|treague;
but in a moment after, &s;he
con&s;idered, that thereby he had rendred
him&s;elf unworthy of her Re&s;pect. <HI>Jea|lou&s;y</HI>
<PB N="150" REF="140">
entred into a clo&s;e Combat with
<HI>Prudence,</HI> and <HI>Prudence</HI> &s;trugled hard to
evercome <HI>Jealou&s;y.</HI> Thus &s;he remain'd
for a con&s;iderable time, uncertain, what
to do.</P>
<P>On the other hand, <HI>Emilia</HI> and <HI>Phila|delphia</HI>
&s;eeing they mu&s;t re&s;olve to con|trive
a way to deliver the Duke out of
his Pri&s;on, at la&s;t concluded, there was
no other means to compa&s;s it, than to
let him down in a great Basket or Ham|per,
with Ropes ty'd to it, out of the
Window, whence they might let him
&s;lide down gently to the Ground. They
were provided with Ropes, the Win|dow
being low, and looking into a &s;oli|tary
part of the Park, they were &s;ecure
no Body would come that way &s;o late
in the Night, to be an Eye-Witne&s;s of
the matter. They propo&s;ed it to the
Duke, as the only way they had left to
help him out, and he readily accepted
of it, not &s;o much out of a de&s;ire of his
engagement with my Lord <HI>Gray,</HI> as the
unea&s;ine&s;s he lay under of being &s;o near
a Lady, unto whom he u&s;ed to &s;wear
every Day, an inviolable Love; and
betwixt two Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es, who, if they
had follow'd the fir&s;t Motions of what
Spite and Rage they bore to one ano|ther,
they would have kill'd one ano|ther
before his Face. So, without more
ado, he got into his Hamper, and in
this little Machine began to move
downward, with good hopes of Succe&s;s,
<PB N="151" REF="141">
had it not been for two unfortunate Ac|cidents.
The fir&s;t was Madam&mdash;who
being no longer able to contain her Jea|lou&s;y
within Bounds, went into the
Apartment of the young Ladies, un|der
pretence of having left her Fan,
and not &s;eeing him there, &s;he moved
towards the Clo&s;et, the Door whereof
being left open by a great piece of care|le&s;&s;ne&s;s,
&s;he &s;aw her Lover go down
gently in the Hamper, without being
perceived either by <HI>Emilia</HI> or <HI>Philadel|phia.</HI>
The Duke was no &s;o carele&s;s as
they, for his Eyes being continually
upon the Window, when he &s;aw that
Lady appear there, he could have wi&s;h|ed
him&s;elf under Ground; &s;o all his
hopes was he &s;hould get down as fa&s;t
as they could let him, and avoid &s;eeing
her for &s;ome Days. But at the &s;ame
moment he perceived, that <HI>Emilia</HI> and
<HI>Philadelphia,</HI> in&s;tead of letting him go
down along the Wall, u&s;ed their utmo&s;t
Efforts, to pull him up again; but their
Hands being too weak and &s;oft to ac|compli&s;h
it, they left him hanging in
the Air.</P>
<P>Being very ill plea&s;ed with the dan|gerous
Station in the airy Region, he
rai&s;ed him&s;elf to &s;ee what was the mat|ter;
but his Curio&s;ity afforded him &s;uf|ficient
matter of Surprize, when he
&s;aw the Earl of <HI>A&mdash;n</HI> walking ju&s;t un|der
the Window, and that he had had
lei&s;ure enough to know him. 'Twas
<PB N="152" REF="142">
this that moved <HI>Emilia</HI> and <HI>Philadelphia,</HI>
not to let the Duke go lower, in hopes
he would not &s;tay there long: But
what Lover would pa&s;s by the Apart|ment
of his Mi&s;tre&s;s, who&s;e Fidelity he
has rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect, without at lea&s;t
ca&s;ting a Look that way; and even the
mo&s;t indifferent Per&s;on would have had
Curio&s;ity enough to ob&s;erve a Hamper,
coming out of a Window. The Duke's
&s;urprize to &s;ee the Earl of <HI>A&mdash;n</HI>
there, was not near &s;o great as the Earls
was, to find him in this Machine: Had
this happen'd in any other place, but in
the King's Court, the Earl would infal|libly
have demanded Satisfaction upon
the Spot from his Rival: His ill For|tune
had brought him thither at a very
ill Hour; He was &s;o highly &s;atisfy'd in
his happy Condition, he thought him|&s;elf
&s;o entirely beloved by <HI>Emilia,</HI> that
the better to devote him&s;elf ab&s;olutely
to his endearing Thoughts, he had cho|&s;en
the mo&s;t &s;hady and &s;olitary part of
the Garden, for his pre&s;ent Retirement.
But as he was going out again, he was
&s;urpriz'd to find the Doors all lock'd up,
except one, which commonly being
kept open longer than the re&s;t, he
went out that way, and accidentally
pa&s;s'd by in &s;ight of <HI>Emilia</HI>'s Chamber.
But he pay'd dearly for this Adven|ture;
To &s;ee a Rival come out thence
at that time of the Night, &s;o dange|rous
a Rival, accu&s;tomed to plea&s;e the
<PB N="153" REF="143">
Ladies, and engage their Hearts. 'Tis
no hard matter to gue&s;s, how his Heart
&s;tood affected at &s;uch a Sight. Neither
was the Duke exempted from feeling
the Effects of &s;o odd an Accident, by
rea&s;on of the pre&s;ence of the Earl of
<HI>A&mdash;n,</HI> whom he intended to &s;upplant,
and of Madam&mdash;, who he was
afraid would not keep Silence, but di&s;|cover
an Intreague, which he would
have kept &s;ecret above all things.</P>
<P>But let us &s;ay &s;omething of <HI>Emilia;</HI>
gue&s;s at her Surprize, when &s;he &s;aw
the Earl of <HI>A&mdash;n</HI> below, and Ma|dam
&mdash;behind her; her Imagina|tion
repre&s;ented to her all the Di&s;con|tents
&s;he was likely to &s;uffer upon this
Account; Shame on one, and Re|proaches
on the other &s;ide. The Duke's
Ingratitude, for whom &s;he was like to
&s;uffer &s;o much, and the Satisfaction of
<HI>Philadelphia:</HI> Under all the&s;e Reflections
&s;he remained &s;o little Mi&s;tre&s;s of her
&s;elf, that &s;he let go the Rope where|with
they held the Duke in the Air,
and had not <HI>Philadelphia</HI> cry'd for A&s;&s;i|&s;tance
from their common Rival, he
had fall'n to the Ground, and the Earl of
<HI>A&mdash;n</HI> would have had the Satisfa|ction
to &s;ee him break his Neck ju&s;t be|fore
his Face. But Madam&mdash;
giving all the A&s;&s;i&s;tance &s;he could to her
Lover, he got down very well; and
what is mo&s;t ob&s;ervable in this Scene,
as &s;omething very peculiar, was, that
<PB N="154" REF="144">
all the Actors thereof were turn'd
Mutes; whether it were that they had
taken a firm Re&s;olution to remain &s;i|lent,
for Rea&s;ons ea&s;ily gue&s;s'd at, or
whether Surprize, Spite and Jealou&s;y
had taken away the u&s;e of their
Tonngues, certain it is, no Body &s;poke
a Word. The Earl of <HI>A&mdash;n</HI> kept at
&s;ome di&s;tance, to avoid the Duke, the
Sight whereof could not but put him
into a great Rage, the Duke of <HI>Mon|mouth</HI>
went a contrary way from the

&s;hould &s;ee him come down thus in a
Hamper. Madam&mdash;flew out of
the Clo&s;et like a Woman in De&s;pair,
without vouch&s;afing either to look upon

<P>The Earl of <HI>A&mdash;n</HI> got no &s;ooner
out of the Park, but he went home,
but being di&s;quieted in his Mind to the

&s;o he order'd his Coach to be got rea|dy,
and went to the Earl of St. <HI>Albans,</HI>
not que&s;tioning but that he &s;hould find
him fa&s;t a&s;leep, it being then two a
Clock in the Morning. He was &s;o far
from fleeping, that he was then di&s;pu|ting
with the Duke of <HI>Buckingham;</HI> the
Earl of <HI>A&mdash;n</HI> hearing them talk very
loud, order'd his <HI>Valet de Chambre</HI> that
attended him, not to knock at the
<PB N="155" REF="145">
door, and he placing him&s;elf near it,
knew his Uncle's Voice, and heard him
give the following An&s;wer to the Earl
of St. <HI>Albans,</HI> No, my Lord, no, I will
never pardon her as long as I live, the
Ingratitude wherewith &s;he repays my
Love; you have been an Eye-witne&s;s of
her Deportment, and of the Reception
&s;he gave me; to me, I &s;ay, who had
done her &s;uch a &s;ignal piece of Service,
in reque&s;ting the King to have her
brought back to <HI>London;</HI> to me, I &s;ay,
who run all Hazards, only to &s;peak with
her for one moment; you can't deny
but that &s;he is the mo&s;t dete&s;table of
all Women. Have you not read, &s;aid
the Earl of St. <HI>Albans,</HI> the Story of the
Amours of King <HI>Henry</HI> IV. with the
fair <HI>Galriela d' Etrees;</HI> yes, &s;aid the
Duke, but I don't &s;ee how a thing that
happen'd an Age ago, &s;hould bear a
Compari&s;on to what pa&s;s'd but la&s;t
Night. I will tell you, continu'd the
Earl; This great Monarch having di&s;|gui&s;ed
him&s;elf in a Pea&s;ant's Habit, to
travel with the more &s;ecurity thro a
Country where the Enemy's Army
lay encamped at that time, pre&s;ented
him&s;elf before his Mi&s;tre&s;s, dre&s;s'd in a
cour&s;e Canva&s;s Jacket, with a Sack of
Straw upon his Head, and wooden
Shooes on his Feet; 'twas only to &s;ee
her he took all this Pains, and run &s;uch
Hazards; notwith&s;tanding all this, ne|ver
did an Act of Gallantry meet with
<PB N="157" REF="146">
le&s;s regard; &s;he look'd upon him from
one &s;ide, and would &s;carce vouch&s;afe
to &s;peak to him. This Adventure
makes me imagine that Lady's &s;et as
much value upon a gli&s;tering out-&s;ide
or &s;$ew, as they do upon the true Me|rits
and Pa&s;&s;ion of a Lover. This is a
Parallel to my Ca&s;e, reply'd the Duke;
my Seaman's Habit, under the di&s;gui&s;e
whereof I &s;lipt into her Chamber, did
offend her nice Humour; and what you
tell me puts me in mind, that one day
when &s;he and I were at variance about
a matter of Con&s;equence, wherein I
own my &s;elf in the wrong; yet &s;he
&s;oon forgave me, becau&s;e &s;he had &s;een
me at <HI>White-Hall</HI> with the Collar of the
Knights of the Garter. You having
had this Tryal before, added the Earl,
you were in the wrong to appear before
her in your Seaman's Cap. The Duke
fell a &s;inging the&s;e words, <HI>A new day,
new care.</HI> I did not in the lea&s;t think,
continu'd he, &s;he would have u&s;ed me
thus as &s;he did; but I am re&s;olv'd to
be reveng'd. You can't do any thing
again&s;t her, but what you will repent
of, &s;aid the Earl to him; I have found
by experience, that we often &s;poil out
of &s;pite a good thing, which is impo&s;&s;i|ble
to be mended afterwards. I knew
not what you have found, &s;aid the Duke,

her Letters, and have them printed for
her &s;atisfaction.</P>

thus again&s;t his Mi&s;tre&s;s; and tho' he
was unacquainted with the cau&s;e, yet
he thought it &s;ufficient, that there was

the Earl, I don't know her, I only e&s;|pou&s;e
your Quarrel; and I am ready to

that, if one time or other, you &s;hould prove
incon&s;tant, you would make me feel &s;uch
Pains, as would prove mortal.</P>
<P>This Letter, &s;aid the Earl of <HI>A&mdash;n,</HI>
being the mo&s;t pa&s;&s;ionate of all we have
read as yet, is to be one of the fir&s;t
that is to be po&s;ted. Unle&s;s you give

S. <HI>Albans,</HI> I a&s;&s;ure you I will lock them
up in my Scrutore, and you &s;hall have
not one of them at your Di&s;po&s;al.
And why &s;o much care for an unfaith|ful
Woman, &s;aid the Duke of <HI>Buck|ingham.</HI>
That is more than you know,
reply'd the Earl, &s;he has only given
you a cold Reception, and perhaps &s;he
thought &s;he had rea&s;on for it. But &s;up|po&s;ing
&s;he had given you real Cau&s;e of
Complaint, would you go about to ru|in
the Reputation of a Lady, you loved
before? The Duke &s;ighed, and without
returning any farther. An&s;wer, de&s;ired
him to go on in the reading of the Let|ters:</P>

<P>HOw malicious is this Dutche&s;s with
blew Eyes and black Hairs? How well
did I interpret her Looks? O how I dread
her? If you can't hate her, you certainly
<PB N="169" REF="159">
are going to cea&s;e to love me. I gue&s;s'd at
your Sighs; they were not intended for me;
you offer your Incen&s;e upon an Altar, whereof
the Smoak only comes to me. But don't ac|cu&s;tom
your &s;elf to the&s;e Practices, for you
will not find me &s;o very ea&s;y, but rather mu|tinous
and quick-fighted; nay, I may perhaps
prove the di&s;turber of your Plea&s;ures.</P>
<P>There is a Touch of Jealou&s;y, conti|nued
the Earl of S. <HI>Albans,</HI> which &s;hews
you were beloved by her. Rather tell
me, reply'd the Duke, that &s;he had a
mind to pick a Quarrel with me; for
the Lady &s;he &s;peaks off, is the Dutche&s;s
of&mdash;. All the World knows,
I was never captivated by her Eyes, and
that if I &s;igh in her Company, 'tis be|cau&s;e
I can't kill her: After all this,
you &s;ee, it &s;erves the Counte&s;s for a
Pretence to quarrel with me. Perhaps
&s;he has been acquainted, added the Earl
of <HI>A&mdash;n,</HI> that you did &s;igh once
for her, and it is natural enough to fear,
lea&s;t what has plea&s;ed us once, may
plea&s;e us for ever. O reply'd the Duke,
I have declared &s;o long ago open War
again&s;t this Favourite, that there is not
the lea&s;t fear of the return of my Love
there, unle&s;s I &s;hould be quite out of
my Sen&s;es. But notwith&s;tanding the
Counte&s;s is &s;ufficiently &s;en&s;ible of this
Truth, you can't imagine how &s;he has
plagued me, and what I have been for|ced
to &s;uffer on account of this whim|&s;ical
<PB N="170" REF="160">
Fiction: Nay, &s;he pu&s;h'd the mat|ter
&s;o far, as if &s;he lay under an Obli|gation

of Fact. Here is, continued he, a
Letter I writ to her in relation of this
Chimera. Let us read it, &s;aid the Earl

I thought your Heart the &s;ure&s;t Pledge,
could cea&s;e out of Jealou&s;ie. Am I the occa&s;ion
of that capricious Humour, and won't you give
me leave to ju&s;tifie my &s;elf? 'Tis not, Ma|dam,
that I pretend to oppo&s;e your Intentions:
If you have a mind to find me guilty, I am
willing to condemn my &s;elf. But if you will
act withont Pa&s;&s;ion, do me what Ju&s;tice is
due to me. Were you capable of Compa&s;&s;ion,
you would pity my pre&s;ent Condition; I am

cruel ones?</P>
<P>I am &s;ure, &s;aid the Earl of <HI>A&mdash;n,</HI>
&s;he could not refu&s;e &s;o tender a Re|que&s;t.

I remember her Charms too well,

with what an envious Eye you were
look'd upon on account of your making
your Addre&s;&s;es to her, becau&s;e every

Offence to the Counte&s;s: For, if it be
a Crime for a Man to love above once
in all his Life-time; no body can be
innocent at that rate. But in &s;pite of

a very ill Reception, and that they &s;er|ved
only to augment her Pride; I pre|tended
to make my Addre&s;&s;es to a Wo|man,

Woman, I loved too tenderly for my

a Man has loved &s;o long, and &s;o

to the &s;ame degree. That is no gene|ral
Rule, &s;aid the Duke; there are cer|tain
Per&s;ons in the World, who can't
live without an amorous Pa&s;&s;ion. But,
added the Earl of St. <HI>Albans,</HI> when you
have thus contracted a habit of loving,
it ought rather to be &s;tiled an Amu&s;e|ment.
You may call it a habit in &s;ome,
there being a certain &s;ort of People, who
never are in earne&s;t in the&s;e Matters.
To ju&s;tify their Incon&s;tancy, they will

that the fir&s;t is generally the mo&s;t vio|lent

be &s;omething of Truth in this; but as
to what concerns my &s;elf, I find always

only change the Object, to day a fair

each in their Arms; this is the only

<PB N="182" REF="172">
to death. I am in hopes the Billet which is
the occa&s;ion of our pre&s;ent Di&s;quiet, will
produce no further ill Con&s;equences; but if
it &s;hould, I can't find in my heart to con&s;ent
to any violent Re&s;olutions: And tho' I love
no Body but your &s;elf, and have a great A|ver&s;ion
to him, who di&s;trubs our Repo&s;e, yet
I will find a way to defend him, whenever
you go about to attack him.</P>
<P>Being now convinced, continued the
Duke, &s;he was a Woman of a generous
Temper, I e&s;teem'd her more than ever;
however, the lo&s;s of the Billet was not
attended by any &s;ini&s;ter Con&s;equences,
becau&s;e <HI>E&s;ther</HI> was &s;o fortunate as to
find it again; and I, for my part, did
not launch out into any Extravagan|cy.
To &s;peak the truth, you give it
the be&s;t Name you can, &s;aid the Earl of
<HI>A&mdash;n;</HI> for what can be more extra|vagant,
than to fight a Man, becau&s;e
he has a &s;ufficient rea&s;on to be exa&s;pe|rated
again&s;t his Wife? How! would
you, cry'd the Duke, have me &s;ee her
expos'd to tho&s;e Sufferings, whereof I
my &s;elf was the cau&s;e; would you have
me do &s;o? Is it ju&s;t, &s;aid the Earl, for
a Man to patronize Coquettry and Infi|delity
in a Woman; is it not much more
agreeable to the Dictates of Rea&s;on, to
leave her to her ill Fortune, and to be
puni&s;h'd by her Husband. Oh! cry'd
the Earl of St. <HI>Albans,</HI> you argue at &s;o
odd a rate, that I can't hear you with
<PB N="183" REF="173">
patience, and I could never have ima|gin'd
you could have deviated &s;o far
from all the Rules of good Sen&s;e. For
my part, &s;aid the Duke, I am &s;o far
from being impatient thereat, that his
Fancy is extreamly diverting; for I
can't conceive how he can lay this
down for a good Maxim, That a Man
who tenderly loves a Lady, and has no
occa&s;ion of Complaint again&s;t her, can
in point of Honour abandon her to the
Anger and ill U&s;age of her Husband.
Here is two to one again&s;t me, &s;aid the
Earl of <HI>A&mdash;n;</HI> and therefore con&s;i|dering
the odds you have again&s;t me,
I cannot wonder at your Re&s;olution of
per&s;i&s;ting in maintaining a bad Cau&s;e;
neither will I go about to reduce you
by my Arguments into the right Path,
which I now tread alone, but content
my &s;elf not to follow your Foot&s;teps:
The Earl of St. <HI>Albans,</HI> without return|ing
an Anfwer, took out another Bil|let.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XVIII.</HEAD>
<P>IF the opportunity, that was given to me,
to oblige a Friend, was infinitely accep|table
to me; I mu&s;t tell you the Obligation it
put me upon of asking this fauour for him,
was infinitely di&s;agreable to me; have a re|&s;pect
to my Vanity, if po&s;&s;ible, I know you to
be generous and grateful; I have inclo&s;ed a

&s;weeten your Refu&s;al; but if you will grant
my Reque&s;t, remember, my Lord, it mu&s;t
be done without delay.</P>
<P>The Memorandum related &s;aid the
Duke, to my Lord <HI>Cl</HI>&mdash;, who was
then afraid of being le&s;&s;en'd in the
King's E&s;teem, by rea&s;on of &s;ome Ad|vice
given by him, which met not with
the de&s;ired Succe&s;s. There was at that
time no great Intimacy betwixt us,
&s;ome hot Words having pa&s;s'd in the
Privy-Council, in a matter wherein we
oppo&s;ed one another with a great deal
of Heat. This made me &s;hew &s;ome
&s;ort of Di&s;&s;atisfaction upon that Head;
and as I may &s;ay it without Vanity, that
I was very in&s;trumental in promoting
him to the Dignity of High-Trea&s;urer,
&s;o, he being &s;en&s;ible he &s;hould &s;tand in
need of my A&s;&s;i&s;tance, to maintain him|&s;elf
in that high Station, and con&s;e|quently
was di&s;turbed at my Coldne&s;s
towards him; he ob&s;erved me &s;o nar|rowly,
that at la&s;t he found out the In|treague
betwixt the Counte&s;s and me,
and &s;oon engaged her in his Intere&s;t;
&s;he being a Lady who made a con&s;ide|rable
Figure, and frequently play'd
at Court. This done, he gave her a Me|morandum,
under pretence of &s;ome
Affair of Moment, but in effect to get
an Opportunity of entring into a Cor|re&s;pondence
with me. I gue&s;s'd imme|diately
<PB N="185" REF="175">
at the Truth of the matter;
and I was &s;oon engaged to grant his
Reque&s;t. The Counte&s;s was highly &s;a|tisfy'd
thereat, and we continued our
Conver&s;ation with mutual Satisfaction,
till the King thought fit to &s;end me to
the <HI>Hague,</HI> in the Quality of his Amba&s;|&s;ador
Extraordinary, to enter upon a
Negotiation of Peace, mo&s;t earne&s;tly
de&s;ired by the <HI>Dutch.</HI> We arrived there
the 4th of <HI>July,</HI> 1672. and after a long
Conference with the Deputies of the
States, went to the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI>
who was then in the Army, and thence
to that of the <HI>French</HI> King's, encamped
near <HI>Vtrecht.</HI> But as Affairs of State
were foreign to our purpo&s;e at pre&s;ent,
at lea&s;t any further than they bear a
relation to my &s;elf in particular, 'twill
be enough to tell you, that the Coun|te&s;s,
&s;ome Days before my Departure
from <HI>London,</HI> writ me a mo&s;t tender

<P>I Am very willing to give you my Picture,
becau&s;e you reque&s;t it, as an allay to your
Pains; and that there is nothing I would not
do to ea&s;e them: But don't you believe I &s;hall
envy its Happine&s;s? You will keep it con&s;tant|ly
by you, you will often look upon it, and
you will u&s;e it with a great deal of Tender|ne&s;s,
whil&s;t I am bewailing your Ab&s;ence;
<PB N="186" REF="176">
and am debarred of all other Plea&s;ures, but
of hearing News from you. I mu&s;t own it to
you, my Lord, I can't per&s;wade my &s;elf as yet,
you are &s;o near your Departure. Your flat|tering
Hopes have in&s;inuated them&s;elves into
my Soul, to prevent my being quite oppre&s;s'd
under the burthen of my pre&s;ent Troubles.</P>

<DIV3 N="20" TYPE="letter">
<HEAD>LETTER XX.</HEAD>
<P>WHat is it I would not give, to put a
&s;top to your Voyage. Alas! how hap|py
were Lovers in the fir&s;t Ages, always true
to their tender Loves; free from Ambition;
they lived in their homely Cottages with their
Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es, they nover left them alone, they
never let them go out of their Sight. Inte|re&s;t
of State, had no Influence upon their
Souls, to di&s;turb their innocent Plea&s;ures; A
Treaty or Negotiation, perhaps founded upon
&s;ini&s;ter De&s;igns, never &s;natch'd the Sheepherd
out of his Sheepherde&s;&s;es Arms. O happy
times, what is become of you? Why did not our
capricious De&s;tiny let us be born in tho&s;e Ages?
I &s;hould then not have undergone thi Di&s;&s;tis|faction
to &s;ee you go away, and you would
have been ready to renounce tho&s;e Chimerical
Notions o$ Glory, which in reality don't af|fect
our Heart; and in&s;tead thereof you
would have made place for yours, for the
&s;weet Enjoyments of a tender Friend&s;hip.</P>
<P>Two &s;uch engaging Letters, reply'd
the Duke, affected me mo&s;t &s;en&s;ibly,
and having found means to &s;pare &s;ome

few Hours to &s;ee the Counte&s;s: O! what
&s;urprizing and engaging things did not
&s;he tell me upon this occa&s;ion. She was
all in Tears, no otherwi&s;e than if I was
agoing to travel from the <HI>South</HI> to the
<HI>North</HI> Pole. Truly, at this very time, I
can't but imagine, that this ungrateful
Woman can cry when &s;he plea&s;es; but
at that time, being fooli&s;h enough to
believe her to be in earne&s;t, I writ, du|ring
this exce&s;s of my Pa&s;&s;ion, this
Billet:</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="21" TYPE="letter">
<HEAD>LETTER XXI.</HEAD>
<P>WHat is it, I &s;hould not tell you upon my
Pa&s;&s;ion, and what Gratitude I owe
you. 'Tis all much below what I feel, and
there is nothing that can challenge a Compari&s;on
with what I would do for you. If you are
the mo&s;t lovely Woman in the World, I can
&s;wear to you, that I am the mo&s;t tender of all
Men living. Let me know at what Hour I
may come to a&s;&s;ure you of it; but above all,
ha&s;ten that happy Minute, for I &s;wear, &s;hould
you delay but never &s;o little, I &s;hall die with
Impatience.</P>
<P>How can you &s;peak ill of a Per&s;on,
&s;aid the Earl of S. <HI>Albans,</HI> that once in|&s;pired
into your Heart &s;o violent a Pa&s;|&s;ion?
Don't you know, that the more
Pains a Woman takes to make her &s;elf
beloved by us, the more Acknowledg|ment
we ought to pay her; for tho&s;e
<PB N="188" REF="178">
feeble Engagements, which langui&s;h
and are ready to fail every Day, &s;erve
only to amu&s;e our Hearts, without giv|ing
them the true Reli&s;h of Plea&s;ure:
Our Soul has no &s;hare in the matter,
we &s;ee our Mi&s;tre&s;s without much Joy
or Di&s;turbance. But, if a Man is
once rai&s;ed to the highe&s;t pitch, all his
Reflections become more nice and live|ly,
his Melancholly has a certain mix|ture
of Sweetne&s;s, his Fears are &s;o
much the &s;tronger, as his Happine&s;s is
more accompli&s;h'd, and touches him to
the quick. What you &s;ay, is very true,
&s;aid the Earl of <HI>A&mdash;n,</HI> interrupting
him, you ought to think your &s;elf high|ly
obliged to a Mi&s;tre&s;s, for the Pains
&s;he takes to appear amiable to you, and
to furni&s;h you with tho&s;e Letters,
which are &s;o agreeable and dear to us:
But after an ungrateful Woman has
found the way to impo&s;e her Charms
upon us, what is it &s;he does not de&s;erve,
in ca&s;e &s;he is the fir&s;t that breaks off with
and abandons her Lover. Let us go on
in the peru&s;al of my Letters, &s;aid the

con&s;ider, whether it is not rational to hate
as much the &s;ame Per&s;on one has loved

Yes, &s;aid the Duke, I &s;ent it

<PB N="189" REF="179">
as yet full of tho&s;e Panegyrick Expre&s;|&s;ions,
wherewith &s;he acted the pa&s;&s;io|nate
Lover to the Life, which I repre|&s;ented
to her in the following Letter:</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="22" TYPE="letter">
<HEAD>LETTER XXII.</HEAD>
<P>THe very Thoughts of being &s;eparated
from you, render my Sufferings &s;o ex|ce&s;&s;ive,
that I have rea&s;on to believe, that
Death it &s;elf will not be &s;o dreadful to me, as
your Ab&s;ence. I am &s;o much altered of late,
that my Friends &s;carce know me. Your Mo|de&s;ty
keeps you in <HI>London,</HI> whil&s;t my Duty
calls me to the <HI>Hague:</HI> Why are not you a
Sheepherde&s;s and I a Sheepherd? What Plea|&s;ures
might not we enjoy in that happy Sta|tion?
I &s;hould have the Satisfaction of &s;eeing
no other Woman but your &s;elf? But alas?
how am I a&s;&s;ured, that you would forget
every body for my &s;ake, as I would neglect
every thing for you.</P>
<P>I was now ready to depart, and my
Lord being enclined to go along with
me, I was very glad of his Company,
being ignorant at that time, that I was
to carry a Spy with me. You will be
&s;oon convinced of the Truth of it, when
I &s;hall tell you, that he was in love with
the Counte&s;s; that he had not as yet
declared his Pa&s;&s;ion to her, and that having
got &s;cent of mine, he al&s;o found out that I
was not indifferent to her, he did not think
it for his purpo&s;e, to endeavour to &s;up|plant
<PB N="190" REF="180">
me openly, but that a private
Enemy being much more dangerous
than a declared Enemy, he intended to
give me &s;uch Blows, as &s;hould not be
in my power to avoid. With this In|tention
only he went into <HI>Holland,</HI> ha|ving
agreed beforehand with my Lady
&mdash;to &s;hew his Letters to the Counte&s;s,
whenever &s;he &s;hould have an Opportu|nity
of talking of him to her; and that
thus the thing might appear very natu|ral
and ea&s;ie, unpremeditated, and
without Affectation. After my Arrival
at the <HI>Hague,</HI> &s;he writ me the mo&s;t ten|der
Letters in the World, and commu|nicated
al&s;o to me the Copies of &s;everal

<PB N="192" REF="182">
certain Opportunities of be&s;towing my
mo&s;t diverting Hours and Thoughts

my Lord&mdash;comes &s;o &s;oftly into

the &s;ight thereof proving to him an en|tire
Confirmation of my good Fortune,
and of his Unhappine&s;s, he was mo&s;t
&s;enbly afflicted thereat. He was ju&s;t
agoing to withdraw, when I ca&s;t my
Eyes upon him; his Pre&s;ence gave me
no &s;mall Di&s;turbance, becau&s;e I fear'd
every thing I ought to fear; I could have
been glad to di&s;cover the Truth, but
dur&s;t not go about to &s;earch for it too
far, lea&s;t I &s;hould let him into a Secret,
whereof he was not Ma&s;ter as yet. We
look'd upon one another with &s;o much

gue&s;s immediately at the Condition
of his Heart. But in relation to my
&s;elf, he had a much clearer in&s;ight into
my Sentiments, than I could have into
his; be&s;ides that, he might ea&s;ily read
my Di&s;turbance in my Eyes. We re|main'd
both &s;ilent, when the Earl of

The Sea&s;on being then extreamly hot,
abundance of Lanthorns were ty'd to
the large&s;t Trees, near unto the Walks,
where they danc'd. The hand&s;ome&s;t
among the Ladies belonging to this lit|tle

and I mu&s;t confe&s;s, that there
were &s;everal among them, which would

greate&s;t Cities of <HI>Europe.</HI> Without &s;peak|ing
of the Prince&s;s of <HI>Vaudemont,</HI> who
for her &s;ingular Merits de&s;erves to
to have the preference before all the

dre&s;s'd like a <HI>Diana,</HI> was attended by

her Shoulders, be&s;ides that, &s;he had &s;e|veral

inter&s;pers'd with Emerauds and
Diamonds. At her Girdle &s;he wore a
Bow, and Arrows, in a Quiver; her
Leggs appear'd half naked, and tho' &s;he
was none of the talle&s;t, &s;he was &s;o nice|ly
&s;haped, and danced with &s;o good a

put me into no &s;mall Confu&s;ion, &s;he
touch'd my Heart to the quick to &s;uch

nearer her, but &s;o prepo&s;&s;e&s;s'd with Fear,
that I never felt the like before in all
my Life. Fair Nymph, &s;aid I, do you
find here a Heart worthy of receiving
your Darts? 'Tis enough for me, re|plied
&s;he, &s;miling, to have found yours,

make them exerci&s;e their Power. Such
an An&s;wer as this, as it could not but
be exceedingly plea&s;ing to me, &s;o I dare
&s;ay it without Vanity, that our Conver|&s;ation
was not only very &s;prightly, but
al&s;o full of Wit, tho' we were often

The Ball ended, and with it all my

World; that they loved one another
mo&s;t pa&s;&s;ionately, and that the&s;e little

known to have drawn her into any In|treague.
My &s;tay at <HI>Bru&s;&s;els</HI> was not to
be of &s;o long a Continuance, as to af|ford

her at her own Game, &s;o I judged
it more prudent to &s;hun her Company,

&s;uch &s;mall hopes of Succe&s;s. However,

<HEAD>LETTER XXVI.</HEAD>
<P>I find you &s;o ungrateful and de&s;pi&s;eable, that
your Incon&s;tancy will not co&s;t me as much
as one Sigh. The que&s;tion is not now, con|cerning
your Sentiments and mine; 'tis e|nough,
that they are &s;o oppo&s;ite to one ano|ther,
that they will never agree again. Had
it plea&s;ed Heavens to let me know you al|ways,
as well as I do now, &s;ince you are tur|ned
incon&s;tant, this would have &s;aved me a
world of Trouble. But without in&s;i&s;ting any
further upon this Head, which can't but cau&s;e
me abundance of Pain; or without putting
you in mind of a piece of Infidelity, which
ought to make you blu&s;h; I will content my
&s;elf with demanding from you my Picture
and Letters, this being the only and the last
thing I &s;hall de&s;ire of you; in lieu whereof I
promi&s;e to forget you, even without &s;o much
as remembring your Name.</P>
<P>I hope, &s;aid the Earl of <HI>A&mdash;n,</HI>
you did not obey her; O! reply'd the
Duke, I never knew a Man yet, who
pretended to &s;uch a nice point of Ho|nour,
as to re&s;tore &s;uch like Favours to
a hand&s;ome Woman. However, this
would prove of very good Con&s;equence,
&s;aid the Earl of St. <HI>Albans,</HI> interrupt|ing
him; and, when Ladies give us &s;uch
tender Proofs of the entire Confidence
in us, it is but rea&s;on we &s;hould not put
them to an ill u&s;e; but rather to make
<PB N="197" REF="187">
them Re&s;titution of a matter of the
greate&s;t moment, the Con&s;equences
whereof may turn to their Ruin. They
would do much better, &s;aid the Duke,
not to run the hazard of it, and not to
write any thing, whereof a di&s;obliged
Lover may make any Advantage again&s;t
them. This Advice is ea&s;y to be given,
&s;aid the Earl of St <HI>Albans,</HI> but not ea&s;y
Task, when a Heart is deeply engaged
in an amorous Intreague, to deny it
&s;elf the Satisfaction of writing a thou|&s;and
pretty Fancies, that come into
ones Head. What Motive can be &s;trong
enough to a Woman to &s;tand always
upon her Guard, again&s;t the Per&s;on &s;he
loves; who if he has known how to
find out the Secret of rendring him&s;elf
Ma&s;ter of his Mi&s;tre&s;s's Heart, how is
it po&s;&s;ible he &s;hould mi&s;s of being ad|mitted
under the quality of her Confi|dent.
At this rate, the Ladies run all
the hazard alone, added the Earl of
<HI>A&mdash;n,</HI> and can accu&s;e no body
but them&s;elves and their own Impru|dence.
The Argument was not likely
to have ended here, had not the Duke
interrupted the Earl, and told him:
I mu&s;t own, that upon the Receipt of
the Counte&s;s's Letter, I was like Thun|der-&s;truck,
&s;o that without giving my
&s;elf any further trouble of accompli&s;h|ing
the Negotiation, (according to my
Order) in which I had hitherto proved
very &s;ucce&s;sful, I bid adieu to all man|ner
<PB N="198" REF="188">
of Bu&s;ine&s;s, without the lea&s;t regard,
and &s;o I embark'd for <HI>London,</HI> like a Fool,
without the lea&s;t regard to the good or
ill Con&s;equences that might attend it.</P>
<P>I can't forbear to reflect upon this Con|duct
of yours, &s;aid the Earl of S. <HI>Albans,</HI> was
it wi&s;ely done, to pitch upon a publick Mi|ni&s;ter,
who is in love, and to entru&s;t him
with a Negotiation of &s;uch va&s;t Con&s;e|quence?
O, cry'd the Duke, and where will
you find one that is otherwi&s;e? Do you be|lieve
that all the&s;e Plenipotentiaries and
Amba&s;&s;adors, who appear with &s;o much
Gravity, are wi&s;er than other People?
'Tis true, they act with more Circum|&s;pection,
and that is the only thing they
are oblig'd to in &s;uch like Ca&s;es by their
Character, but for the re&s;t, I am confi|dent,
they are as much for an Intreague
as any body el&s;e. During my Voyage,
continued he, all my Thonghts were
taken up in finding out what rea&s;on of
Complaint the Counte&s;s could have a|gain&s;t
me, and finding it could be no|thing
el&s;e, but my Addre&s;&s;es to the
Counte&s;s of <HI>Grimbergue,</HI> I went for|ward,
with a Re&s;olution to be revenged
of the Per&s;on that had plaid me this
Game, without in the lea&s;t thinking it
was my Lord&mdash;, for I never heard
of this Tran&s;action till &s;ome time after.
Upon my arrival at <HI>London,</HI> in&s;tead of
going &s;traitway to <HI>White-Hall,</HI> I went
immediately to the Connte&s;s's; but to
add to my pre&s;ent Misfortune, I under|&s;tood
<PB N="199" REF="189">
&s;he was gone to <HI>Tunbridge,</HI> to drink
the Waters: Had I follow'd the Inclina|tions
of my Heart, I had gone thither
without delay, but con&s;idering what
extravagancies I had been guilty of up|on
her Account already, I thought it be&s;t
not to venture any further for that time.</P>
<P>When I came to the King to give him
an account of the Progre&s;s of the Ne|gotiation,
I &s;wear to you, I appear'd in
&s;o di&s;tracted a Condition, that his Ma|je&s;ty
concluded I had been drinking hard
in the Yatcht, and that the Vapours of
the Wine had bereaved me of my Me|mory.
He &s;oon di&s;mi&s;&s;ed me, and I
could ea&s;ily gue&s;s at his Thoughts; but
without giving my &s;elf the trouble to
undeceive him, I &s;hut my &s;elf up in my
Clo&s;et, and &s;pent the whole Night in
Writing, &s;ometimes Ver&s;es, and &s;ome|times
in Pro&s;e, but in the main, relating
altogether to bitter Complaints; being
touch'd mo&s;t &s;en&s;ibly with the unrea&s;o|nable
Deportment of the Counte&s;s.
After all, nothing I had written &s;eem|ing
to me convincing enough, I judged I
had better go and &s;ee her in Per&s;on; but
knowing her to be of a very po&s;itive
and re&s;olute Temper, and that, if &s;he
once got it into her Head, &s;he would
neither &s;ee nor hear me; I re&s;olved to
di&s;gui&s;e my &s;elf, and &s;pent the remain|der
of the Night, in contriving which
way be&s;t to effect it. At la&s;t a Thought
came into my Head, which plea&s;ed me
<PB N="200" REF="190">
infinitely. I knew her to be addicted
highly to Super&s;tition, and her Inclina|tions
leading &s;o far to hear her Fortune
told her, that &s;he was always in &s;earch
after every Body, that pretended but to
the lea&s;t Skill or Reputation in A&s;trolo|gy,
I my &s;elf having &s;everal times
brought <HI>G&mdash;y</HI> the A&s;trologer to her.
With this Re&s;olution therefore to per|&s;onate
a South-&s;ayer, I appear'd in the
King's Pre&s;ence, much dejected, laying
one Hand to my Head, and the other
upon my Heart, as if I had been very
ill. He &s;oon perceived it, and ask'd me
with his wonted Goodne&s;s, how I did;
I told him I was mo&s;t mi&s;erably afflicted
with the Head-ach, and a continual
Palpitation of the Heart, and that I
felt &s;ome Symptoms of a Feaver: As
ill Fortune would have it, I look'd &s;o
well in the Face, that this alone was
&s;ufficient to betray my Intentions, and
the King &s;hewing much Compa&s;&s;ion for
me, I could not act my Part &s;o nicely,
but that I blu&s;h'd, and was quite con|founded
at the Untruth I had told him.
One Day having engaged Doctor <HI>F&mdash;r</HI>
to meet me in the King's Apartment,
and the King enquiring after my Health,
he told him, that nothing could be more
proper to prevent my falling into a
dangerous Di&s;temper, than <HI>Tunbridge</HI>
Waters&punc; Go then, &s;aid the King to
me, tho' I have great occa&s;ion for you
at pre&s;ent, I will po&s;tpone my Intere&s;ts
<PB N="201" REF="191">
to your Health; I mu&s;t confe&s;s to you,
I was &s;o &s;en&s;ible of the King's Good|ne&s;s,
that I was &s;everal times upon the
point of declaring the Truth to him,
but dur&s;t not, for fear of &s;poiling all.</P>
<P>I left the King, highly &s;atisfy'd with
his having given me leave to take my
Journey, and pitch'd upon the Earl of
<HI>A&mdash;e,</HI> my Friend, as a Confident,
he being then deputed by the Parlia|ment
of <HI>Scotland,</HI> to make their mo&s;t
humble Remon&s;trances to the King,
concerning Matters of the greate&s;t mo|ment;
He &s;tood in need of my Intere&s;t
at Court, and therefore having &s;ought
all po&s;&s;ible means to enter into a &s;trict
Friend&s;hip with me, I was &s;ure he
would be very glad of taking this op|portunity
to oblige me. I imparted to
him the whole Secret, and he was
over-joy'd to &s;ee me furni&s;h him with
means to put an obligation upon me. It
was agreed he &s;hould go to <HI>Tunbridge</HI>
fir&s;t, and endeavour, to rai&s;e in the
Counte&s;s a curio&s;ity of con&s;ulting me
under the di&s;gui&s;e of an A&s;trologer.
You know the Earl to be a Man of
&s;en&s;e, who under his grave and &s;edate
Deportment, conceals a great deal of a
very plea&s;ing Temper; &s;o that I judg|ed
I could not put the management
of this De&s;ign into better hands than
his. He found the Counte&s;s very me|lancholy
and pen&s;ive; the pre&s;ence of
her Husband, for whom &s;he always
<PB N="202" REF="192">
&s;hew'd a great Regard, having, be&s;ides
this, put her under a great Con&s;traint,
&s;he entertain'd in her Brea&s;t a &s;ecret
Spite again&s;t me, which tormented her
without intermi&s;&s;ion; and as often as
&s;he con&s;ider'd that I had prefer'd the
Counte&s;s of <HI>Grimbergue</HI> before her, &s;he
was &s;o enrag'd at me, that &s;he thought
of nothing but Revenge. 'Twas in this
Condition the Earl found her; he ask'd
her a among other things, whether &s;he
had heard nothing of that famous <HI>Lap|ponida?</HI>
She an&s;wer'd, &s;he knew not
what he meant; and that he &s;hould ex|plain
him&s;elf, whether it were a Man,
a Bea&s;t, or a Plant. The Earl &s;mil'd at
her Ignorance, and told her, that <HI>Lap|ponida</HI>
&s;ignify'd as much as <HI>Laplander,</HI>
highly yers'd in <HI>A&s;trology,</HI> and inclining
to Sorcery; that being inform'd this
noted Negromancer was to be at <HI>Tun|bridge,</HI>
he was come hither from <HI>London</HI>
on purpo&s;e to make him calculate his
Nativity, becau&s;e he could tell as well
pa&s;s'd as pre&s;ent, and future things.</P>
<P>The Counte&s;s was &s;o well pleas'd at
the&s;e words, that &s;he ask'd him a thou|&s;and
Que&s;tions; whether this <HI>Laplander</HI>
could &s;peak <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> whether he was of
an ea&s;y Acce&s;s, what kind of a Crea|ture
he was, and whether he had Di&s;|cretion
enough to keep a Secret? He
told her, the <HI>Laplander</HI> under&s;tood <HI>Eng|li&s;h</HI>
as well as his own Tongue; that
he was of a very odd Temper, avoided
<PB N="203" REF="193">
the Conver&s;ation of Women, &s;poke lit|tle,
and was at lea&s;t 200 years old;
but it is by his great Knowledge he
has protracted his Life, for knowing
the Virtues of all Simples, he has found
out the way of making him&s;elf young
again. He is &s;o old, &s;aid he, that he
foretold Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> all that &s;hould
happen to the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> whereat
you know &s;he could not but be very
nearly concern'd. And why, &s;aid &s;he,
did he not at the &s;ame time in&s;truct
her how to avoid the&s;e misfortunes?
You require too much, reply'd the
Earl, Fate will take its own Cour&s;e;
and why then, continu'd &s;he, are we
de&s;irous to foreknow our Di&s;graces,
&s;ince it is not in our power to prevent
them? Rea&s;on, and a prudent Conduct,
return'd he, may &s;tand in great &s;tead
upon &s;uch like occa&s;ions. The Coun|te&s;s
&s;aid no more, but appearing ex|treamly
di&s;con&s;olate, the Earl took
his leave.</P>
<P>I came two days after to <HI>Tunbridge,</HI>
di&s;gui&s;ed like a true S$rcerer, but
dur&s;t not &s;tir out of my Chamber, for
fear of being hollow'd at by the Boys;
being not in a humour at this time to
divert the Rabble with a publick &s;hew.
The Earl went immediately to pay a
Vi&s;it to the Counte&s;s, but would not
be the fir&s;t that &s;hould &s;peak of my
Arrival; &s;o &s;he &s;taid a good while be|fore
&s;he ask'd him, whether he had
<PB N="204" REF="194">
heard any thing concerning the <HI>Lap|lander;</HI>
he told her, he was arrived in
good Health; and that finding in him
&s;omething more &s;urprizing, than what
he had heard before, had engaged him
to lodge in the &s;ame Hou&s;e where he
was. I prote&s;t to you, as a Friend,
&s;aid &s;he, I am very de&s;irous to &s;ee him.
Oh! Madam, reply'd he, that is impo&s;|&s;ible,
'tis above 140 years &s;ince he
hates Women as much as Death it &s;elf.
You mu&s;t endeavour, return'd &s;he, to
reconcile him to our Sex; I might as
well, reply'd the Earl, go about to
learn his Art, as to per&s;wade him to
what you would have me to do; how|ever,
I am &s;o ambitious of obliging you,
that I would leave nothing unattempt|ed
for your &s;atisfaction; and you &s;hall
know the &s;ucce&s;s to morrow. Every
moment that kept me from the &s;ight
of the Counte&s;s, &s;eem'd to me a year:
The Earl and I had contriv'd the matter
thus; For him to conduct her into my
Apartment, where every thing was to be
clo&s;e &s;hut up, for fear &s;he &s;hould know
me; and the better to alter my Voice,
I was to hold &s;omething in my Mouth.
I &s;pent the Night betwixt hope and
fear; in hopes to &s;peak to her, and in
fear of exa&s;perating her, and of mi&s;|carrying
in my De&s;ign. But there
happened another Accident, <HI>viz.</HI> her
Husband would not &s;uffer her to go
to the Earl of <HI>A&mdash;e,</HI> and told her,
<PB N="205" REF="195">
that if all the <HI>Laplanders,</HI> with <HI>Lappenida</HI>
at their Head, were there, it was be|low
the Quality of a Lord's Wife to
demean her &s;elf thus far. The next
thing we had to do, was how to find
out another Expedient for our Inter|view;
and it was agreed &s;he &s;hould
come at Night to a certain &s;mall Wood,
whither the Earl was to conduct me,
as her Husband was to bring her thi|ther;
there being no great occa&s;ion of
being jealous of a Man of 200 years
old.</P>
<P>Every thing being thus agreed, I ex|pected
the coming of the Night with
the utmo&s;t impatience, and we went
thither in the dusk of the Evening, for
fear of being &s;een. My Garb was a
black long Robe, I had a long white
Beard, a Turbant on my Head; and
in &s;hort, every thing &s;uitable to what I
intended to repre&s;ent in this Ma&s;que|rade.
By chance I e&s;py'd a crooked
Trunk of a Tree, which I cho&s;e for my
&s;eat, the better to per&s;onate a Sorcerer;
and I neglected nothing which might
make every thing appear as natural as
could be. I was &s;carce well &s;eated,
when we heard the Counte&s;s's Coach
&s;top at &s;ome di&s;tance from us; and the
Earl drawing nearer that way, &s;aw her
Husband leading her by the Hand,
without hearing her &s;peak one word.
I did not think, &s;aid he, laughing, that
when one is to con&s;ult an A&s;trologer,
<PB N="206" REF="196">
one mu&s;t be debarr'd from &s;peaking to
one's Friends; the Lady &s;mil'd, but
without &s;peaking one word, and &s;o
came to me. The two Earls &s;taying
at &s;ome di&s;tance from us, &s;he &s;eated
her &s;elf upon the Mo&s;s at the foot of
the &s;ame Tree, near which I had taken
my place, I found &s;uch a di&s;turbance
within my &s;elf, that I had &s;carce power
to ask her, upon what account &s;he
came to con&s;ult me. Don't you know
it, O! Divine Man, &s;aid &s;he, without
I tell it you? And &s;ince you are already
acquainted with my Thoughts, what
need you to expect any Que&s;tions
from me? Well, Madam, reply'd I, I
mu&s;t tell you then, Your Heart is
&s;eiz'd with a mo&s;t agreeable Pa&s;&s;ion;
but you have unju&s;tly taken an Aver|&s;ion
to him who is your Admirer; you
have writ very &s;evere Letters to him;
you fly him, and are come to this place
with no other intention than to avoid
the &s;ight of him; is not this the real
Truth? Yes, &s;aid &s;he, I mu&s;t own it.
But pray give me a de&s;cription of the
Per&s;on of this Gentleman; He is a tall
Man, of a goodly Pre&s;ence, &s;aid I to
her; his Air is noble, and his Conver|&s;ation
extreamly engaging; he has a
great &s;hare in the Favour of his Ma|&s;ter;
and I a&s;&s;ure you, Madam, that if
my Art does not deceive me, you are
&s;ole Mi&s;tre&s;s of his Heart. At the&s;e
words the Lady bur&s;t out a laughing
<PB N="207" REF="197">
aloud; you Blockhead, cry'd &s;he, thou
ha&s;t been bubbled into an Adventure,
and takes a great deal of Pains for no|thing!
Know that I am not the Coun|te&s;s
of&mdash;, but that thou ha&s;t
talk'd to the Dutche&s;s of <HI>Richmond,</HI> and
that this very moment &s;he is a going
to make thee know who thou be'&s;t.
You may ea&s;ily gue&s;s at my &s;urprize;
but this Di&s;appointment did not how|ever
affect me &s;o much, as it would
have done, with any other Per&s;on than
her &s;elf. My dear Si&s;ter, &s;aid I, &s;top|ping
her again&s;t her Will, and rea&s;|&s;uming
my natural Voice, take heed
not to di&s;clo&s;e this Secret, but rather
a&s;&s;i&s;t me in this De&s;ign; I conjure
you, &s;ince by what I have done, you
may be convinced I love her heartily.
The Dutche&s;s of <HI>Richmond</HI> embracing
me with much Tenderne&s;s, you are a
true <HI>Protheus,</HI> &s;aid &s;he, and 'tis well
you di&s;covered your &s;elf, for I &s;hould
certainly have &s;poil'd your Market.</P>
<P>She then told me, that at the earn|e&s;t
Intreaties of her Friends to go to
<HI>Tunbridge,</HI> &s;he had at la&s;t re&s;olv'd all
on a &s;udden to go thither; that &s;he
happen'd ju&s;t to come to the Coun|te&s;s's
Lodgings about an hour before
this Nocturnal Appointment; and that
hearing them talk &s;trange things of a
<HI>Laplander,</HI> it came into her head, that
&s;omething of a De&s;ign lay conceal'd
under the Pretences of his great Age,
<PB N="208" REF="198">
and excellency of his Art. To make
tryal of his Skill, &s;he had offer'd to go
in&s;tead of the Counte&s;s, and had found
my Genius &s;o far removed from its na|tural
Cour&s;e, as to &s;uffer it &s;elf thus to
be catch'd in the Trap. I told her I
was but a Novice in the Conjuring
Art, but de&s;ir'd her to go back to the
Counte&s;s, and to relate Wonders of
me; &s;he fail'd not to do according to
my de&s;ire, and acted her part to a mi|racle;
for the Earl happening to find
the Counte&s;s in her Coach, whil&s;t he
thought &s;he had been with me, did not
doubt but that I &s;hould betray my &s;elf;
and was upon the point of coming back
to tell me what he had &s;een; when &s;he
told him it was the Dutche&s;s of <HI>Rich|mond,</HI>
that was with me, he then flat|ter'd
him&s;elf, I would certainly know
her; and whil&s;t he was expecting her
return with as much impatience as un|ea&s;ine&s;s,
he &s;aw her coming towards
the Coac$$, O! cry'd &s;he, with a loud
Voice, the mo&s;t skilful of Men, and the
happie&s;t of Mortals upon Earth; what
&s;urprizing things has not told me;
his Knowledge is pa&s;s'd expre&s;&s;ing. She
would have run on in my prai&s;e, if the
Counte&s;s, impatient to &s;ee me, had not
left her, and made all the ha&s;t &s;he
could towards the Tree near which I
had &s;eated my &s;elf. I was &s;carce reco|ver'd
out of my Surprize, and fearing
le&s;t they &s;hould play me the &s;ame
<PB N="207" REF="199">
Game over again, I was re&s;olved, to
be fir&s;t well a&s;&s;ured of the Per&s;on I
&s;poke to, before I proceeded to di&s;co|ver
my Art.</P>
<P>Scarce had the Counte&s;s taken
her Place next to mine, but &s;he told
me, Mo&s;t divine <HI>Lapponida,</HI> if by
your Art you are able to pene|trate
into the Secrets of my Heart,
and find out a way of ea&s;ing my
Pain, nothing &s;hall be &s;o great,
but what you may expect from my
Graritude; Knowing this to be the
Counte&s;s's Voice, I took her by the
Hand; and, Madam, &s;aid I, I am not
a Man to be guided by Intere&s;t, you
did not pitch upon the right Method,
when you intended to engage me in
your behalf, by the Promi&s;es of Re|wards
which I never coveted; the
only thing I have to de&s;ire of you is,
to put &s;omewhat of Confidence in
me. Which way, &s;aid &s;he, can I re|fu&s;e
it to you, who can foretel every
thing, and know in &s;pite of my &s;elf,
what I would fain keep conceal'd.
You rea&s;on to a Miracle, reply'd I,
you are endow'd with &s;o exqui&s;ite a
Wit, that I am not &s;urpri&s;ed at the
favourable A&s;pects and Influences of
the Stars upon you. <HI>Venus,</HI> in Con|junction
with <HI>Sol,</HI> gives you both Pru|dence
and Beauty. <HI>Jupiter</HI> in a direct
<PB N="208" REF="200">
Line with <HI>Mars; L</HI>&mdash;Pray &s;peak
to me in an intelligible Language,
&s;aid &s;he, and let me know, what
made a certain Man, for whom I had
a great Kindne&s;s, cea&s;e to love me.
Your &s;urpri&s;e is very wrong, &s;aid I,
he loves you &s;till, and never loved
any body el&s;e; he langui&s;hes for you,
he is ready to die for Vexation, when
he reflects upon what Aver&s;ion you
have conceived again&s;t him. Since
you are &s;o dexterous at knowing his
Sentiments, I wonder you &s;hould not
di&s;cover in me a Di&s;po&s;ition quite con|trary
to what you &s;peak of: But I am
certain, that during a Voyage he made
lately, this ungrateful Man be&s;tow'd
my Picture upon a Woman, who never
will love him the with &s;ame Tender|ne&s;s
as I have done.</P>
<P>I can a&s;&s;ure you, &s;aid the Duke,
that I found in this Conver&s;ation, all
the Plea&s;ures one is capable of feeling
in the hight of a nice and mo&s;t tender
Pa&s;&s;ion; and as I had no rea&s;on to ima|gine,
that the Counte&s;s would have
at this time a de&s;ign of impo&s;ing upon
me, &s;ince pa&s;&s;ing for a <HI>Laplander,</HI> and
a Per&s;on not in the lea&s;t concerned in
her Affairs, it was equal to me whe|ther
&s;he loved or hated her Lover; &s;o
I read it in her Heart, and plainly
perceived, that I was &s;till very dear to
her, beyond what I could have expect|ed
<PB N="209" REF="201">
at this time. I being very de&s;i|rous
to know that charitable Per&s;on,
who had been pleas'd to do me this
good Office, told the Counte&s;s, &s;he
mu&s;t put an entire Confidence in me,
and that I pray'd her to tell me, how
&s;he came to know that her Lover had
proved unfaithful. I was acquainted
with it, &s;aid &s;he, by one of my
Friends, unto whom it was written by a
Per&s;on of Quality; you mu&s;t de&s;cribe
his Per&s;on to me, &s;aid I, if you expect
I &s;hould foretel you the real Con&s;e|quences
thereof. By the De&s;cription
&s;he gave me, and the Su&s;picion I had
conceived before of Madam&mdash;
and my Lord&mdash;, I was ea&s;ily
convinced I had not gue&s;s'd ami&s;s,
My Art tells me, continued I, that
tho&s;e Per&s;ons you &s;peak of ought to
be &s;u&s;pected to you, it being their
De&s;ign to di&s;turb your Repo&s;e. Alas!
&s;aid &s;he, with a mo&s;t charming Voice,
if their De&s;ign was to put me to an
exce&s;s of Pain, they have had their
ends. I can a&s;&s;ure you, my Eyes have
&s;een no Sleep &s;ince that unhappy
Day this Lady brought me this di&s;|agreeable
Tydings. There is a great|er
Share of Vanity than of Tender|ne&s;s
in your Sufferings, &s;aid I, you
are vex'd at this Gentleman's having
preferr'd another before you. I could
wi&s;h it were no otherwi&s;e, reply'd
<PB N="210" REF="202">
&s;he, this would not be quite &s;o mor|tifying
to me, &s;ince perhaps I might
find out &s;ome way or other to com|fort
my &s;elf for &s;uch a Di&s;grace; but
the nearer I examine my Heart, the
more I am &s;en&s;ible of its Frailties.</P>
<P>It was no longer in my Power to
&s;tand out again&s;t the&s;e A&s;&s;urances,
which &s;erved for an undeniable Con|firmation
to me of my Happine&s;s. I
aro&s;e from my crooked piece of Wood,
with much Precipitation, and ca&s;ting
my &s;elf at her Feet, Pray don't di&s;|own
me, Madam, &s;aid I, embracing
her Knees, I am the mo&s;t tender and
faithful Lover in the World; I &s;hould
die for Grief upon this very Spot, had
I been guilty of cea&s;ing to love you
but for a moment, beyond my own
Life. Your Picture, which I have a|bout
me, ought to convince you of
tho&s;e Forgeries they have impo&s;ed
upon you. In the name of your
Friend&s;hip, in the name of the mo&s;t
tender Pa&s;&s;ion that ever was known,
re&s;tore me to your Favours, re&s;tore
to me that, without which I can't
live any longer. I was upon the point
of telling her a thou&s;and more tender
and pa&s;&s;ionate things, during the&s;e
fir&s;t Motions of Joy, Love, and Ac|knowledgment:
But can you gue&s;s,
without &s;etting up for a <HI>Laplander,</HI>
can you gue&s;s, I &s;ay, what An&s;wer
<PB N="211" REF="203">
this capricious Woman made me to
all the&s;e pa&s;&s;ionate Expre&s;&s;ions? How
my Lord, cry'd &s;he, is it you my
Lord, who under this premeditated
Di&s;gui&s;e come to &s;natch this Secret
from me? Do you think thus to
abu&s;e my Inclinations for A&s;trologi|cal
Predictions? And you judge you
have &s;ufficiently cleared your &s;elf,
when you &s;wear, I have been mi&s;|guided
by Fal&s;hoods. Oh, my Lord,
how far you have deceived your &s;elf,
in chu&s;ing &s;uch Methods as are direct|ly
oppo&s;ite to what you owe to me.
You ought to have born your Suffe|rings
without murmuring, and with|out
breaking forth into Complaints;
you ought to have expected from my
Goodne&s;s, to be recall'd out of this
kind of Bani&s;hment, but in lieu
thereof you mu&s;t go and take a Con|fident;
and tho' I look upon the Earl
of <HI>A&mdash;e</HI> as a Man of Honour,
yet I am almo&s;t reduced to De&s;pair,
he &s;hould be acquainted with this Af|fai.
You mu&s;t needs al&s;o di&s;cover
your &s;elf to the Dutche&s;s of <HI>Richmond,</HI>
and in &s;hort, you have expo&s;ed me to
the wor&s;t of Accidents, for &s;hould
my Husband get the lea&s;t notice of
this Adventure, he would without
any regard to my Innocence, and
your M$lice, &s;acrifice me me alone to
his Re&s;enrment. All the&s;e Rea&s;ons
<PB N="212" REF="204">
repre&s;ent you before my Eyes, as
an Object altogether unworthy of my
Tenderne&s;s, which you have thus
abu&s;ed, and been wanting in every
thing you owe to me; nay, you
have had Cruelty enough, to hazard
my Life.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t &s;he was making this &s;o
&s;ine, &s;o well di&s;po&s;ed, and &s;o well
contrived Harangue, I &s;tood confoun|ded
at what I heard her &s;ay now,
and what &s;he &s;poke but a moment
before. Is it po&s;&s;ible, &s;aid I, that
the &s;ame Mouth &s;hould in &s;o &s;hort
a time, utter oppo&s;ite matters? Is
this the &s;ame Woman who &s;ighed
before <HI>Laponida</HI> for having lo&s;t the
Duke of <HI>Buckingham,</HI> and now treats
the Duke of <HI>Buckingham</HI> like a mi|&s;erable
Wretch, whil&s;t he is lying
at her Feet. I mu&s;t own, that at
that very In&s;tant, Spite and Anger
&s;o far prevail'd over my Heart,
that for &s;ometime I could not &s;ay one
Word; &s;he had &s;carce fini&s;h'd part of
her Di&s;cour&s;e, when I added &s;uch a
Conclu&s;ion, as &s;he little expected
from me. For, in lieu of attempt|ing
to allay her Anger by Submi&s;|&s;ion,
I cry'd, O you mo&s;t un&s;table
and mo&s;t extravagant of Woman|kind!
I leave you for the whole Re|mainder
of my Days; you &s;hall,
whil&s;t you live, never hear either
<PB N="213" REF="205">
good or bad Tydings from me; I re|pent
of the Pains I have taken to
come near you, but am ready to
leave you immediately, and will for
ever &s;hun you to the utmo&s;t of my
Power. I had no &s;ooner &s;aid the&s;e
Words, but away I flew from her
like Lightning, and tho', as it &s;eem'd
to me, &s;he follow'd me, and cry'd,
<HI>Laponida, Laponida,</HI> I was in &s;o ill
an Humour, that I did not think
her worthy of an An&s;wer. She was
no &s;ooner gone back to the Place,
where the Dutche&s;s of <HI>Richmond,</HI> her
Husband, and the Earl, &s;taid for her
coming; but the la&s;t came to find
me near the Tree, but it being a
dark Night, could not find me,
and looking about for fear I had
lo&s;t my &s;elf in the Wood, whil&s;t I
expected his coming in my Coach,
much di&s;&s;atisfy'd at his long &s;tay, I
&s;aw him come at la&s;t. He upbraid|ed
me with having given him &s;o
much Trouble, but I being then in
a very &s;curvy Humour, an&s;wered
him &s;o abruptly, tho' I was actual|ly
in the wrong, that he thought fit
not to return any further An&s;wer.</P>
<P>Our di&s;pute being &s;oon ended,
what do you think, &s;aid I, of
this long Conver&s;ation I had with
the Counte&s;s? Every thing that can
be thought happy, &s;aid he; to be
<PB N="214" REF="206">
alone in a Wood with a Lady one
loves, and by whom one is belov'd?
To be con&s;ider'd under &s;uch Circum|&s;tances
of a Reconciliation; <HI>viz.</HI> that
the Husband is jealous, and at the
&s;ame time &s;tands Sentinel? To be
witty and both lovely? Now you
may judge of my Thoughts. O!
&s;aid I, &s;ighing, Appearances often
prove fallacious: You think I have
made my Peace with her, becau&s;e
one would &s;uppo&s;e it to be &s;o; but
I had to do with &s;o capricious a
Woman, and who gave me &s;o ill a
Reception, that I have quite broke
off with her. The Earl could &s;carce
believe me, till I &s;poke &s;o &s;eriou&s;ly,
that he could not but take my
word for it, e&s;pecially, &s;ince there
was not &s;ufficient matter of Diver|&s;ion
in the thing, to put one upon
an Invention of this Nature. I pro|te&s;t
to you, &s;aid he, I am amazed
to the highe&s;t degree: I thought
your Merits might have &s;ecured
you again&s;t &s;uch an Accident: No
more of Merits, my Lord, &s;aid I,
I will do my &s;elf Ju&s;tice, and own
my Faults, &s;ome whereof are perhaps
very con$iderable; but I will not
allow any in Love. Do you know
a &s;ure way how to be revenged of
her, &s;aid the Earl; Yes, reply'd I,
to forget her for ever: 'Twas that
<PB N="215" REF="207">
I intended to have advi&s;ed you to,
added he, but you were too quick
for me? You &s;hall &s;ee, &s;aid I, &s;miling,
that, if my A&s;trologers Habit was
not well &s;uited for the reviving of
an Intreague, it &s;hall &s;erve to break
it off.</P>
<P>I would advi&s;e you, reply'd he, to
vi&s;it the Dutche&s;s of <HI>Richmond,</HI> who
lodging in the &s;ame Hou&s;e with the
Counte&s;s, you may confer with her,
and endeavour a Reconcliation. Hea|vens
prevent me, cry'd I, I will leave
the Place &s;o &s;oon as it is Day; You
may do what you plea&s;e, &s;aid he, but
what will the King think of your &s;ud|den
Return; I will find an Excu&s;e
for it, &s;aid I to him, and let it fall out
as it will, he will look upon it as a
piece of Gallantry. It &s;eems to me
more proper, &s;aid he, to go to one of
your Country Seats, and to &s;tay there
for Fourteen Days, without being
known at Court. Since you are en|clined,
reply'd I, to take your Share
in my ill Humour and Solitarine&s;s,
rather then return to <HI>London,</HI> come
let us go to <HI>Clevedon.</HI> He promis'd
very obligingly to go along with
me thither, to my no &s;mall Sati&s;|faction;
for I &s;tood highly in need
of a good Companion to a&s;&s;i&s;t me in
tearing from my Heart the remaining
<HI>Ideas</HI> of the Counte&s;s, and nothing can
<PB N="216" REF="208">
happen more unfortunate to a Man
oppre&s;s'd with a violent Pa&s;&s;ion, which
affords him &s;ufficient matter of Com|plaint,
thus to want a Friend, unto
whom he may di&s;charge his Heart to
ea&s;e his Pains.</P>
<P>So &s;oon as we returned to <HI>Tun|bridge,</HI>
I threw my &s;elf upon the Bed,
being quite &s;pent with Vexation; I
had not lain there long, when I
heard them cry out, <HI>Fire, Fire;</HI> and
thinking it might perhaps, be at the
Counte&s;s's, becau&s;e her Hou&s;e was
not far di&s;tant from ours, I aro&s;e,
and looking out of the Window,
ask'd &s;everal Per&s;ons that pa&s;s'd by
in great ha&s;te, where the Fire was.
It being already pretty light, they
look'd upon me; but in&s;tead of an|&s;wering
me, bur&s;t out a lauging. I
could not imagine the meaning of
it, nor why they &s;hould not an|&s;wer
me, not remembring that it
was my Antcik Habit, which I had
&s;till upon me, made them laugh at
its Novelty. I was extreamly vex'd
at this U&s;age, when the Earl of
<HI>Argyle,</HI> entring abruptly into the
Room; You are very quiet, &s;aid he,
con&s;idering the Fire is ready to
break in upon you. What, &s;aid I,
Is this Hou&s;e on Fire? 'Tis &s;o much,
&s;aid he, that we mu&s;t either &s;ave
our &s;elves out of the Window, or
<PB N="217" REF="209">
el&s;e run the hazard of being burnt
in going down Stairs. They brought
us a Ladder, and the Earl being the
fir&s;t that got down, run into the
Stable, to give orders for the Hor&s;es
to be brought out, they being ready
to be &s;tifled by the Smoak. I for
my part did not que&s;tion, but that
I might make u&s;e of the &s;ame Lad|der,
to get down into the Court,
but it being divulged by the Fel|lows
belonging to the Stables, that
I was a famous Sorcerer, &s;ome of
the Mob took away the Ladder, in
hopes to &s;ee me &s;hew one of my
Ma&s;ter-pieces, to fly into the Air
like a Bird; and at the &s;ame time
others coming with a Ladder to
my a&s;&s;i&s;tance, they would not &s;uf|fer
it to be fixt to the Window,
alledging that I being a Sorcerer, I
de&s;erved to be burnt alive.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t confe&s;s, I never was put
more to it in all my Life-time;
the Smoak was &s;o thick in my Cham|ber,
that I was almo&s;t &s;uffocated by
it, and not being able to cry for
help, I knew not what to do. It
very luckily came into my mind,
that it was my white Beard, and
my Conjurer's Cloaths, that had
drawn me into this mi&s;chief, &s;o I
threw them off; and having ju&s;t
&s;o much Breath left as to cry out
<PB N="218" REF="210">
of the Window, &s;ave the Duke of
<HI>Buckingham;</HI> they knew me, brought
a Ladder, and I got down with ea&s;e.
The &s;udden change from the Smoak
into the Air, threw me into a
Swoon; which being told to the
Earl of <HI>Argyle,</HI> he came to my a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance,
and &s;upporting me, till I came
to the Bank of a Rivulet, I &s;at
down upon the Gra&s;s, leaning a|gain&s;t
a Tree. I am much concern'd,
&s;aid I, to find my &s;elf &s;till here,
pray give the nece&s;&s;ary Orders for
our immediate departure. Don't
you fear, &s;aid he, le&s;t you &s;hould
not be able to bear riding in the
Coach; I dread more &s;ome &s;ini&s;ter
Accident, of &s;eeing again the Coun|te&s;s,
being re&s;olv'd, after what &s;he
has done, never to forgive her. He
fell a laughing, and that is to &s;ay,
continu'd he, to &s;ee her, and to
forgive her, is one and the &s;ame
thing; that is to &s;ay, reply'd I,
that I am &s;en&s;ible of my Frailty
for her, and that I would rather
chu&s;e to avoid her, than put &s;uch a
con&s;traint upon my Inclinations.</P>
<P>Is it not true, my Lord, con|tinu'd
the Duke of <HI>Buckingham,</HI> that,
how ea&s;ily Chance might bring the
Counte&s;s among the&s;e Trees, at|tended
only by her Confident, to
take the Benefit and Plea&s;ure of
<PB N="219" REF="211">
the fre&s;h Air, and of a murmuring
Brook; and perhaps al&s;o to ea&s;e
her Mind by &s;ighing, and uttering
bitter Reproaches and Complaints
again&s;t me. And &s;uppo&s;ing I lye
here &s;o far conceal'd, as not to be
di&s;covered by her; I &s;hould perhaps
ari&s;e on a &s;udden, throw my &s;elf at
her Feet, embrace her, and &s;ue for
Peace. As I tell you ingenuou&s;ly my
true Sentiments, &s;o there &s;eems no|thing
wanting to accompli&s;h this
Adventure, but her Pre&s;ence; But
Accidents don't depend on our
choice; the Counte&s;s did not ap|pear,
tho' to confe&s;s the Truth with
all &s;incerity, I &s;hould have been
over-joy'd if good Chance, and the
Intelligencies of Love, would have
brought her to this place. I went
&s;trait to <HI>Clevedom,</HI> in Company with
the Earl of <HI>Argyle,</HI> who gave me
all po&s;&s;ible a&s;&s;i&s;tance to allay my
Grief. He &s;hew'd &s;o much complai|&s;ance
for me, as to hear with a great
deal of patience, every thing I told
him; and his an&s;wers were &s;o full of
Goodne&s;s, as to prove a &s;ingular
Comfort to my pre&s;ent Afflictions.
But &s;ince we talk of Complai&s;ance,
&s;aid the Duke, I find, tho' &s;omewhat
late, I have abu&s;ed your Patience, it
being broad day; and I can't imagine
what made me run on thus for &s;o
<PB N="220" REF="212">
long a time. O! good my Lord,
cry'd the Earl of St. <HI>Albans,</HI> don't
check your &s;elf, for having &s;pent a
few hours with us, and don't think
of leaving us, till you have given us
the whole Conclu&s;ion of this Adven|ture.
'Twill be much more proper,
&s;aid the Earl of <HI>A&mdash;n,</HI> to let him
take a little Re&s;t, and for us to do
the &s;ame, that we may be in a con|dition
to hear him, with the more
Attention afterwards. The Earl of
St. <HI>Albans</HI> very well liked this Propo|&s;al;
this Hou&s;e being one of the
fine&s;t in <HI>London,</HI> he ordered a nice
Collation to be brought in for Break|fa&s;t,
which being over, the Duke of
<HI>Buckingham</HI> and his Nephew were
each conducted into a magnificent
Chamber to take their Repo&s;e, which
they took till towards Evening:
They were then entertained with a
very fine Supper; but as Lovers,
when they are at Variance with their
Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es, &s;eldom have any great
&s;tomach to their Victuals, &s;o it hap|pened
with the Duke of <HI>Buckingham,</HI>
and the Earl of <HI>A&mdash;n</HI> at this time.
The Duke &s;eeing his two Friends to

the King of your &s;tay at <HI>Clevedone?</HI> Is it

Word of his An&s;wer to yours. You will be
the greate&s;t Lo&s;er betwixt us, &s;aid he &s;mi|ling,
for perhaps he may write me &s;ome
plea&s;ant things, which you would be glad
to hear, and which may divert you from
that &s;plenetick Humour you &s;eem to court
&s;o much now. It matters not, reply'd I,
I am &s;o very well plea&s;ed with my pre&s;ent
<HI>Men hating</HI> Humour, that I mu&s;t think
my &s;elf mad if I &s;hould change it for any
other: I am re&s;olved to hate all the World,
<PB N="355" REF="216">
except you. <HI>My Lord,</HI> &s;aid he, this Ex|ception
being &s;o advantagious to me, I can't
but be highly &s;en&s;ible of it: but 'tis impo&s;|&s;ible
you &s;hould per&s;i&s;t in a Re&s;oluti|on
which would debar you the Conver|&s;ation
of &s;o many Per&s;ons of Honour
that love you. This Re&s;olution, reply'd I,
will rob me only of the Conver&s;ation of a
few; for as times now go, 'tis enough to
act the Hypocrite, our Inclinations having
little or no Share in our Conver&s;ation; he
who has the mo&s;t regard to Honour and
Affection, being &s;ure to be the Bub|ble.
The Earl being of a contrary Opi|nion,
which he always maintain'd with a
grear deal of Wit, this cau&s;ed &s;everal very
diverting Di&s;cour&s;es betwixt us.</P>
<P>All this while I continued in my &s;plene|tick
Humour, being vex'd at my &s;elf for
having incen&s;ed the Counte&s;s afre&s;h. Alas!
&s;aid I to my &s;elf, I ought to have &s;ubmitted
to what &s;he told me, during the fir&s;t Mo|tions
of her Heart, whereof perhaps &s;he her
&s;elf was not Mi&s;tre&s;s at that time: What
did I go to <HI>Tunbridge</HI> for, but to appea&s;e
her? And thus I have willfully rendered
my whole Journey fruitle&s;s. I re&s;olved to
write to her, but &s;ome of my Letters not
&s;eeming to me tender and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive e|nough,
and &s;ometimes thinking my &s;elf not
&s;o much in the wrong, I liked none of
them, and &s;o laid them up in my Scru|tore.
I concluded, that in order to cure me
of my Love, I mu&s;t find &s;ome other Amu&s;e|ment,
<PB N="356" REF="217">
which might divert my Heart and
Thoughts another way.</P>
<P>There is no other Method, &s;aid I, to the
Earl of <HI>Argyle,</HI> to get rid of the&s;e fatal
Chains, which, as long as I wear, will &s;carce
afford me one day's Tranquillity: She is
&s;ufficiently di&s;po&s;ed to form my Proce&s;s;
I need only tell her, that I love el&s;e|where,
and &s;he will not fail to believe
it; for &s;he is already jealous without Rea|&s;on,
and condemns me without being heard:
No, I am re&s;olved I will love her no longer.</P>
<P>But, continued I, what if I &s;hould have
the &s;ame Fate with another, who may
perhaps play the Tyrant, 'tis much better
not to love at all, but to enjoy the Ea&s;e of
a <HI>happy Indifferency.</HI> Alas, <HI>My Lord,</HI> cry'd
the Earl of <HI>Argyle,</HI> this is a Task which
will prove more difficult to you, than to o|thers:
After having ta&s;ted the Plea&s;ures of
Love, during your Engagements with the
Counte&s;s of S&mdash;you can't live without
Loving. 'Tis true, reply'd I, &s;ighing at the
plea&s;ing Ideas, that dear Name revived in
my Mind, I was the happie&s;t of Lovers, but
it is al&s;o no le&s;s true, that after &s;uch ex|ceeding
Delights, I could not but expect
&s;ome mixture of bitterne&s;s in my next Pa&s;|&s;ion:
And the Counte&s;s of&mdash;has &s;uf|ficiently
puni&s;h'd me for having loved any
body but Madam S&mdash;</P>
<P>You will highly oblige me, &s;aid the E. of
<HI>Argyle,</HI> in relating to me the Particulars of
that Intreague. Alas! &s;aid I, that is a Wound
not to be touch'd without a mo&s;t violent
<PB N="357" REF="218">
Pain: not that I would deny your Reque&s;t,
but only defer the Rehear&s;al thereof, till I
may do it with le&s;s Di&s;turbance. The Earl,
who aim'd at nothing more than to
amu&s;e me, would not in&s;i&s;t further upon a
Matter which he found di&s;agreeable to my
pre&s;ent Di&s;po&s;ition, but in the mo&s;t oblig|ing
manner in the World, &s;ubmitted to all
my capricious Humours.</P>
<P>One Day, walking along the River &s;ide,
&s;aw him at a di&s;tance, &s;itting upon a
Hillock, reading a Letter very attentive|ly.
I approach'd as ea&s;ie as I could, but
coming near him, he folded up the Let|ter,
and without &s;peaking one word, put it
into his Pocket: I was a little nettled at
it, yet for &s;ome time talk'd only of indiffe|rent
Matters, till at la&s;t I ask'd him whether
he had any News from <HI>London?</HI> Yes, re|ply'd
he, The Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI> has gi|ven
me an account of what pa&s;&s;es at Court.
Are they Matters of Con&s;equence, &s;aid I?
Had they been &s;uch, reply'd he, you &s;hould
have known it before this; but they being
only Matters of Gallantry, are not &s;uitable
to your pre&s;ent Condition. His An&s;wer ha|ving
rai&s;ed in me a Curio&s;ity to know what
pa&s;s'd: I told him, 'tis true, I had re&s;olved
to deny my &s;elf all tho&s;e Amu&s;ements that
infect the Heart and Mind, and which di&s;|turb
the Repo&s;e of our Lives; neverthele&s;s
as I find my &s;elf never the better for not
hearing of the&s;e Matters, you will oblige
me in communicating the Contents of
your Letter to me. Done, &s;aid the Earl,
<PB N="358" REF="219">
giving me the Letter, you will meet with
&s;omething that is new there. The Letter I
read ran thus: <HI>You are much in the wrong to
pa&s;s your time at</HI> Clevedom, <HI>whil&s;t we have
here a growing Beauty, admired by all that
&s;ee her. I won't tell you who &s;he is, to rai&s;e
your Curio&s;ity to the highe&s;t pitch: but know
that &s;he is beloved by all the World; that the
E. of</HI> S. Albans <HI>adores her; that the E. of</HI>
O&mdash;<HI>&s;ighs for her; and that &s;he has made
&s;o general a Conque&s;t of Hearts, that there
are none left for our Ladies. If you are ca|pable
of pity, prepare your &s;elves to afford
them &s;ome Comfort: But you will &s;carce be
long in a condition to pity others; for &s;o &s;oon
as you have beheld</HI> Donna Maria de Bal|boza,
<HI>you will have work enough to commi|&s;erate
your own Ca&s;e. Alas! what have I
done? I have nam'd her to you! You mu&s;t
know then, that the Queen has &s;ent for her
out of</HI> Portugal, <HI>to attend her, and be one of
her Ladies of Honour, notwith&s;tanding the
oppo&s;ition of many at Court. Adieu,</HI> My
Lord, <HI>I reckon you and the Duke of</HI> Buck|ingham
<HI>will &s;ay I &s;eldom bring any plea&s;ing
News.</HI></P>
<P>I expected no le&s;s, &s;aid the Earl of
S. <HI>Albans,</HI> interrupting the Duke of <HI>Buck|ingham,</HI>
than to be brought in among the
Lovers of <HI>Donna Maria,</HI> but am in a capacity
at pre&s;ent to hear her mentioned without
Di&s;turbance. If it be &s;o, reply'd the Duke,
I will proceed.</P>
<P>After having read the D. of <HI>Monmouth</HI>'s
Letter, I told the E. of <HI>Argyle: Could you
<PB N="359" REF="220">
be in Love with this Stranger?</HI> He return'd,
<HI>and could not you be in Love with this
Stranger?</HI> I wi&s;h I could, reply'd I, for
this would be a means to cure my Pa&s;&s;ion
for the Counte&s;s. As to my &s;elf, &s;aid
he, having no &s;uch Di&s;temper, I don't care
to venture upon &s;o hazardous a Cu$e: I
am not fond of Trouble, and therefore pre|fer
a happy Indifference before all the Plea|&s;ures
of Love. Hah, <HI>My Lord,</HI> cry'd I,
I don't believe you to have &s;o ill a Reli&s;h.
And I believe, reply'd he &s;miling, you cer|tainly
have: pray call to mind the Suffer|ings
and Vexations, even of the happie&s;t of
Lovers, the capricious Humours of our
Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es, Jealou&s;ies and Slights: don't
you remember that the unfortunate hours
doe much over-ballance the happy ones;
&s;o that if Men, when they begin to love,
were but &s;en&s;ible of the Di&s;appointments,
and other Vexations, which are in&s;eparable
Companions of Love Intreagues, they
would &s;hun it like Death it &s;elf. Does the
E. of <HI>Argyle,</HI> cry'd I, talk at that rate,
and mu&s;t the Duke of <HI>Buckingham</HI> betray
his Frailty in oppo&s;ing his Sentiments.
Notwith&s;tanding the ill Treatment I have
received from the Counte&s;s, and the Re|pul&s;es
from a capricious Woman of an un|equal
Rank to me, I &s;ay it is convenient to
love. Yes, yes, &s;aid I, after having pau&s;ed a
while, I will maintain it to be &s;o. An in|different
Per&s;on is never &s;en&s;ible of true
Plea&s;ure: 'tis Love that makes us out|brave
our Misfortunes, becau&s;e it in&s;pires
<PB N="360" REF="221">
us with noble and great Sentiments; it
creates in us an Emulation, and makes
us &s;urmount all Difficulties.</P>
<P>I am charm'd, &s;aid the E. of <HI>Argyle,</HI> to hear
you &s;peak at that rate, your Reconciliation
with the Coun$e&s;s is certainly at hand; I
don't que&s;tion but to &s;ee you in a few Days
langui&s;hing at her Feet, and her of a more
pliable Temper. No, no, cry'd I, you
will never &s;ee that; but if this Lady <HI>Bal|boza</HI>
is as lovely as the Duke of <HI>Mon|mouth</HI>
makes her in his Letter, I mu&s;t con|fe&s;s,
I could be heartily glad to enter into
an amorous Intreague with her. The <HI>Por|tugueze</HI>
Ladies have naturally a great deal
of Wit and Sprightline&s;s, they are Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es
of a certain Vivacity, which keeps a Lover
from turning indifferent; they never are
without &s;omething that is new: whether
plea&s;ed or angry, there is an infinite di|ver&s;ion
in their Conver&s;ation: To &s;peak
frankly, the more I think of her, the
more I am re&s;olved to Love her.</P>
<P>But, &s;aid the E. of <HI>Argyle,</HI> &s;uppo&s;ing
her to have given a favourable Ear to the
Duke of <HI>Monmouth,</HI> or to the E. of S. <HI>Al|bans,</HI>
will you go about to di&s;lodge them?
And will it not be much better to put on
again your former Chains? My Rivals,
cry'd I, (with a &s;ort of a &s;cornful Air)
have always given to me the Honour
of Precedency; the only thing I fear,
is that perhaps &s;he may not be of a
very amorous Di&s;po&s;ition. A plea&s;ant whim
indeed, &s;aid he, you are afraid that the
<PB N="361" REF="222">
Per&s;on you propo&s;e to Love, has not made
any great impre&s;&s;ion upon her Lovers? If
I were &s;en&s;ible of it by my &s;elf, reply'd I,
I needed not labour under that Unea&s;ine&s;s,
becau&s;e I &s;hould be a Judge of her Merits
and Charms; but as the ca&s;e now &s;tands, I
can only &s;uppo&s;e her lovely, as far as &s;he
is belov'd. Your Rule, an&s;wered the Earl,
is not without Exception; we &s;ome|times
engage in &s;uch odd Intreagues, as
would appear unpardonable, were it not for
that common excu&s;e <HI>Love is Blind.</HI> After all,
&s;aid I, I hope you will agree with me in
this, that a young Lady who is admired
by many, may challenge the Preference be|fore
one that has no Admirers at all? At
this he could not forbear laughing; and,
&s;aid he, you are then in Love, when mu&s;t
we meet at <HI>White-Hall?</HI> To morrow, &s;aid
I, tho' perhaps I may find my &s;elf mi&s;taken
in &s;everal of the&s;e Perfections, I propo&s;e
to my &s;elf; for, notwith&s;tanding, as &s;he
is a <HI>Portugueze,</HI> &s;he ought to have Wit,
&s;he may perhaps have none; be&s;ides this, I
would have her Eyes large and black, and &s;o
full of Lu&s;tre, as &s;carce to be endured by her
Admirers; Teeth as bright as Pearls, her
Bo&s;om and Complexion white, or in carna|tion
Colour, and of Stature tall, and nicely
&s;haped. You are mi&s;taken, &s;aid he, for I
am certain, that among a thou&s;and <HI>Portu|guezes,</HI>
you won't meet with one &s;uch as
you de&s;cribe her, unle&s;s you be&s;peak her
on purpo&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="362" REF="223">
How, reply'd I, have they not generally
large Eyes? Yes, &s;aid he, many of them
have; but as for their Teeth, you mu&s;t not
expect them of an Oriental Pearl Colour;
for their u&s;ing abundance of Chocolat
and Sweet-meats, &s;poils their Teeth in
their Infancy. As for their Complexio$, you
may have it white enough if you love
Painting, but without it, I will warrant it
brown. After all, &s;aid I, I would
rather have it &s;o, than if it were be&s;me$$d
with Plai&s;ter work. They are, &s;aid the
Earl, neither tall nor plump, all <HI>Portu|gueze</HI>
Women being &s;mall and lean. What,
cry'd I, without Exception, &s;urely they
don't ca&s;t them all in one Mould? I only
tell you my Opinion, continued he &s;mil|ing,
and if you will write and be &s;atisfy'd
in the Matter, we &s;hall &s;ee whether you
or I have gue&s;s'd be&s;t. Truly, reply'd I
with a Smile, methinks you are very bold to
make &s;uch a Compari&s;on; don't you remem|ber
that I acted the Sorcerer not long ago?
I am &s;o far from having forgotten it, &s;aid
he, that I often remember it, but never
without being ready to die with laughing;
your di&s;gui&s;e was &s;o plea&s;antly contrived,
that had it not been for that Love Pa&s;&s;ion
that had &s;eized your Heart, you would
have made much better Sport.</P>
<P>I writ a Letter to my <HI>Dutch Picture Dra|wer,</HI>
with orders to endeavour to draw the
Picture of <HI>Donna Maria Balboza,</HI> and to
&s;end it to me. I &s;hew'd this Letter to the
Earl of <HI>Argyle,</HI> who told me with a plea|&s;ant
<PB N="363" REF="224">
Air; it is an ancient Cu&s;tom among
Kings and Princes, to have the Pictures of
the Prince&s;&s;es they intend to e&s;pou&s;e, &s;ent
to them; but yours is a peculiar Fancy to
&s;end for the Picture of a Per&s;on, you only
propo&s;e to love. Divert your &s;elf at my
co&s;t, return'd I, as long as you plea&s;e, I
will take it all, provided you will write
to the Duke of <HI>Monmouth,</HI> and de&s;ire him
to let you know, whether &s;he has Wit, and
is agreeable in Conver&s;ation; whether &s;he
is &s;trait Limb'd, and writes well; for I
confe&s;s, I am ready to engage with her if
his An&s;wer proves &s;uitable to my De&s;ires.</P>
<P>Alas, reply'd he, what Confidence can
you put in his An&s;wer, his Pa&s;&s;ion for her
mu&s;t needs be look'd upon as partial. I a|gree
with you in this point, &s;aid I; but I
would have him &s;end us &s;ome of her Let|ters;
for &s;he that writes well, can't want
Wit. Since there are many that don't want
Wit, reply'd the Earl, and yet write very
ill, why may not a Per&s;on write well, and
yet have no Wit? No, &s;aid I, that is im|po&s;&s;ible;
you may tell me of &s;ome People,
that Talk well, and yet Write ill; and of
&s;ome who Write well, but Talk ill; but
both Sorts don't want Wit, and if I could
&s;ee one of her Letters I would be &s;atisfy'd.</P>
<P>And do you imagine, &s;aid he, that if the
Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI> has any of her Letters,
he will tru&s;t them with us? Why not, re|ply'd
I, as we are his Friends; I am con|$ident
he will be well plea&s;ed to &s;ee us ad|mire
a Lady he thinks &s;o lovely him&s;elf.
<PB N="364" REF="225">
Then write you your &s;elf, &s;aid the Earl,
'tis po&s;&s;ible, that he being always ready to
&s;erve you, this will make him le&s;s &s;crupu|lous
upon this Head.</P>
<P>We return'd not to <HI>Clevedone</HI> till it was
pretty late, which made me urge the Earl
to go to Supper, before he writ the Let|ter&punc;
but he perceiving I would be very
well plea&s;ed if he did otherwi&s;e, went into
my Clo&s;et, and in a few Moments after, gave
me his Letter to the Duke of <HI>Monmouth,</HI>
which I &s;ent with as much Care, as if all
the Felicity of my Life had depended on
it. The next Day in the Evening, the
Me&s;&s;enger I had &s;ent to <HI>London,</HI> returned
from <HI>London</HI> with the Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI>'s
An&s;wer to the Earl of <HI>Argyle,</HI> conceived in
the following Words.</P>
<P>'TIS not without great rea&s;on the Duke
of <HI>Buckingham</HI> is &s;o de&s;irous of &s;ee|ing
&s;ome of the fair <HI>Portugeze</HI>'s Letters;
for &s;he writes as well as &s;he &s;peaks, and &s;he
&s;peaks beyond any body Living. 'Tis a mi&s;|fortune
that &s;he will write only of indiffe|rent
Matters, at lea&s;t I have &s;een no others
as yet, tho' I have done all I could, to en|gage
her to alter her Stile. Her Eyes have
told me more than once, that &s;he would re|pre&s;ent
Love to admiration, but &s;he is &s;o
very cautious to engage her &s;elf that way,
that either &s;he has been told &s;trange Stories
of Love, or el&s;e has met with &s;ome Di&s;ap|pointments,
I have not been able to learn,
as yet. I &s;ent you what &s;he writ ye&s;terday
<PB N="365" REF="226">
at the Counte&s;s of <HI>O&mdash;</HI> where Mrs.
<HI>Bevrewell</HI> happening to &s;hew a Letter from
Mr. <HI>S. Evremont,</HI> every one gave his Opi|nion
upon it; the Letter meeting with great
Commendation from the mo&s;t judicious, but
with &s;ome reproof from the Ignorant Criticks,
this rai&s;ed a Di&s;pute concerning the diffe|rent
ways of Writing, wherein <HI>Donna Maria</HI>
out doing all the re&s;t, her Di&s;cour&s;e was &s;o
plea&s;ing to me, that I engaged her to leave
&s;ome part of it in Writing, which I &s;end
and leave to your judgment.</P>
<P>The Duke of <HI>Buckingham</HI> having look'd
for &s;ome time among his Papers, at la&s;t
found and produced the following Advice,
how to Write well.</P>
<P>[1] I lay this down for a general
Rule, that in all, but e&s;pecially in what
we call the Epi&s;tolar Stile, always a due
Regard ought to be had to good and true
Sen&s;e, and never to deviate from it. Write
as you &s;peak, and endeavour to give things
a certain noble, but ea&s;ie Turn, without Af|fectation
or pompous Words, which makes
a deep Impre&s;&s;ion, and is infinitely plea&s;ing.
As far as is po&s;&s;ible avoid Repetitions;
but if that cannot be done, and they fall
in naturally, you may make u&s;e of them,
without any further Scruple.</P>
<P>[2] Tho' the <HI>Portugueze, Spaniards,</HI>
and <HI>Italians,</HI> are very fond of Metaphors,
(the chief Ornaments of their Letters,)
they are not according to my Palate; it
being my Opinion, that we need not di&s;|place
<PB N="366" REF="227">
the Sun and Stars, no more than to
conde&s;cend to a mean and pedantique Stile.
The fine&s;t and nice&s;t things are be&s;t ex|pre&s;t
in an ea&s;ie and natural way, without
putting our Wit to the Rack.</P>
<P>[3] You mu&s;t have a due Regard to
your own Quality, as well as to that of
the Per&s;on unto whom you write, and to
the Subject you are to entertain him with.
As to the la&s;t, keep as clo&s;e to it, as po&s;|&s;ibly
you can; and in re&s;pect to the fir&s;t,
make an exact Di&s;tinction, as well in re|ference
to his Birth, as to his Merits; but
you mu&s;t always expre&s;s your Honourable
Sentiments, and even your good Will to
every body, and make u&s;e of &s;uch Expre&s;|&s;ions
as may di&s;cover your noble Inclina|tions
to them.</P>
<P>[4] If you write about Bu&s;ine&s;s, ex|pre&s;s
your &s;elf in conci&s;e but plain Terms,
without leaving the lea&s;t room for Am|biguity
or double Interpretation.</P>
<P>[5] You may ea&s;ily avoid long Phra&s;es,
ful&s;om Periods, and &s;uch Parenthe&s;es, as
interrupt the whole &s;en&s;e of a Letter. It
happens often, that you mu&s;t be oblig'd to
read a Letter more than once, before you
can attain to the true Sen&s;e thereof.</P>
<P>[6] All manner of <HI>Galimatias</HI> or
Bomba&s;t mu&s;t never enter into an Epi&s;tle;
this will prove no difficult task for &s;uch as
are not in a Capacity to make high
Flights, which when they attempt, they
are often lo&s;t among the Clouds, and fall
very low afterwards. Every one ought to
<PB N="367" REF="228">
examine his own Capacity, and to be
cautious not to &s;ay more than what he
would have, and in &s;o doing, he will &s;el|dom
fail of &s;aying as much as is requi&s;ite
for his purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>[7] There are certain Expre&s;&s;ions, &s;o
nice and refined, as to leave behind them
an Eagerne&s;s in the Reader, of gue&s;&s;ing
more than is expre&s;s'd in the Letter. A
Per&s;on of Wit ought not to be too lavi&s;hing
in this kind; tho' this is a point, not to
be managed by every body with Di&s;cretion;
for, if a good number of plea&s;ant Fancies
crowd in upon us, we are &s;o fond of them,
as not to pa&s;s by any without in&s;erting
them. But your Friend to whom you
write will be much better plea&s;ed with
you, if you don't &s;pend your fewel all at
once, and will look upon your Letter as
more acceptable, if you leave him room
of exerting his Thoughts and Fancies upon
it him&s;elf. You ought always to have
more Regard to your Friend's &s;atisfaction,
than to your own.</P>
<P>[8] If you are to enter upon Compli|ments,
let them be graceful and &s;hort, and
endeavour to give them an uncommon and
hand&s;ome Turn, beyond what is u&s;ually
ob&s;erved in the ordinary way of Compli|menting.</P>
<P>[9] Con&s;olatory Letters mu&s;t never
be long, but Affectionate, and touching
home upon the Subject; &s;o as to make
your &s;elf a &s;harer in your Friends Mi&s;|fortune,
without Affectation or Pride, and
<PB N="368" REF="229">
without hard and far-fetch'd Expre&s;&s;ions.
You may al&s;o add &s;ome Chri&s;tian-like Re|flexions,
provided they &s;avour neither of
Pedantry nor Bigottry.</P>
<P>[10] If we are to be&s;tow a Favour, it
ought to be done with a prompt and
generous Compliance. A long expect
Obligation lo&s;es much of its true Value,
and in ca&s;es of this nature, never be negli|gent
in writing.</P>
<P>[11] If you are under a nece&s;&s;ity of
refu&s;ing a Favour, you ought to &s;weeten
your Refu&s;al by all the kind Expre&s;&s;ions
you are able, and by giving &s;ome hopes
of obliging your Friend for the future.</P>
<P>[12] In ca&s;e you are to write a chiding
Letter, don't correct your Friend in haugh|ty
and cholerick Terms; but in &s;uch as
are full of Goodne&s;s, and founded upon
Ju&s;tice. He that has committed a Fault, is
&s;ufficiently puni&s;h'd already, without the
addition of bitter and inveighing Words,
which will appear to be rather the effects
of your Pa&s;&s;ion, than of your Rea&s;on.</P>
<P>[13] If you will write to the Per&s;on
you love, only con&s;ult your own Heart,
that knows be&s;t how to &s;peak in your be|half,
and will &s;ometimes &s;ay more than it
ought. Men are not ty'd to very &s;trict
Rules in this ca&s;e; but mo&s;t Ladies would
be happier, if they had forgot how to
write, when they engage in a thing of this
nature.</P>
<P>[14] Whenever we are to write to a
Per&s;on &s;uperior to us, either in Merits or
<PB N="369" REF="230">
Dignities, it ought to be done in Terms
full of Re&s;pect and Submi&s;&s;ion; and if we
mu&s;t take care not to write in an abject
and ba&s;e Stile, &s;o we mu&s;t not neglect
to give every one his due. Civility is an
excellent Qualification, particularly in Per|&s;ons
of Quality: This is often the only
current Coin wherewith they pay every
body.</P>
<P>[15] As it is ea&s;ie to write an obli|ging
Letter when one lends Money, &s;o
it is a difficult Matter to write well if
you borrow it. There is a certain Re|luctancy
in Nature to things of this kind,
to &s;uch a degree, that he who receives the
Letter, reads it with &s;omething of Pre|judice,
which make him find Faults where
actually there are none.</P>
<P>[16] Never trouble your &s;elf to find
a good Conclu&s;ion to your Letter; but if
a good Thought falls into your Head, to
be &s;ure make u&s;e of it; but if not, <HI>I am,
&amp;c.</HI> is enough upon occa&s;ion; it always
&s;tands good.</P>
<P>[17] New Thoughts, full of jollity, and
well turn'd, inter&s;per&s;ed as it were carele&s;ly
and unperceived throughout a Letter, carry
along with them a mo&s;t graceful Charm,
provided there is in them a certain in|termixture
of Plea&s;antne&s;s and Wi&s;dom,
and that every thing appears to flow from
its natural Source. An affected Letter is
not worth reading.</P>
<P>[18] Suppo&s;ing you to be never &s;o
Learned, never affect to &s;hew it in your
<PB N="370" REF="231">
Letters; at lea&s;t, not unle&s;s it be to &s;ome
other Per&s;on of Learning, or where a Point
of Wit is in que&s;tion. Your only bu&s;ine&s;s
is to expre&s;s well your meaning, and that
is not &s;o ea&s;ie to be done.</P>
<P>[19] Be always as conci&s;e as po&s;&s;ibly
you can, but without affecting a laconique
Stile, which expre&s;&s;es &s;carce one half of
your Intentions, for this &s;erves for
nothing el&s;e than to confound Matters in
ob&s;curity; whereas the whole &s;ecret con|&s;i&s;ts
in explaining our&s;elves in a neat and
natural Stile: If you have not the gift of
expre&s;&s;ing your&s;elf in ten Lines, you do
better to make u&s;e of twenty.</P>
<P>[20] Avoid all manner of hard, re|flecting
and ambiguous Terms, Proverbs
and By-words, which &s;erve only to &s;tuff
up a Letter with what is ful&s;om to the
Reader.</P>
<P>[21] As you ought never to be care|le&s;s
in what you write, &s;o you mu&s;t en|deavour
&s;o artificially to conceal the care
you take of writing well, that the whole
may appear ea&s;ie and plain. You mu&s;t
blot out and correct, till you are &s;atisfy'd
with what you have writ; and whil&s;t
you are writing your Thoughts,
Words will fall in, and that in due
cour&s;e; the chief point is to chu&s;e the
be&s;t; happy is he who can do it well at
all times.</P>
<P>It &s;eems, &s;aid the Earl of <HI>A&mdash;n</HI> to the
Duke of <HI>Buckingham,</HI> as if you did not
read this Advice without &s;ome Vexati|on.
<PB N="371" REF="232">
There are a thou&s;and things in it, re|ply'd
he, enough to vex me; of this you
may be &s;oon convinced, if you will re|member,
that it is not Wit alone I look for,
but would fain &s;ee &s;omething of Tender|ne&s;s,
which Character I can't as yet di&s;|cover
in the&s;e Rules pre&s;cribed by her.
'Tis true, they contain &s;omething that is
very Natural, but for the re&s;t, it has a
very &s;lender relation to my Satisfacti|on,
that a young Lady, whom you would
Love, knows how to write a complimen|tal,
begging, or con&s;olatory Letter; this
&s;eems very foregin as yet to my pur|po&s;e.
Alas! <HI>My Lord,</HI> &s;aid I, addre&s;&s;ing
my &s;elf to the Earl of <HI>Argyle,</HI> this young
<HI>Portugueze</HI> mocks me, and too much abu&s;es
our de&s;ires, when &s;he pretends, at her Age,
to amu&s;e us with &s;uch Le&s;&s;ons, upon &s;uch
indifferent Matters. I could wi&s;h &s;he had
employ'd her Pen in the &s;ame &s;oft manner
that a Lady of her Country did, who&s;e
Name, if I mi&s;take not, was <HI>Mariana,</HI> who&s;e
Letters we have &s;een among us. You mu&s;t
own, that nothing can be more pa&s;&s;ionate if
I could once &s;ee a Letter of hers, like tho&s;e
I would adore her, nay I would turn ra|ving
Mad for her &s;ake.</P>
<P>And who has told you, an&s;wered the
Earl, that &s;he never writ thus to her
Lover? Would you have her appear under
this Character at the Counte&s;&s;es of <HI>O</HI>&mdash;
among a &s;ect of Ladies, pretending to the
&s;tricte&s;t Rules of Vertue, and among many
Men, with whom &s;he had &s;carce any ac|quaintance.
<PB N="372" REF="233">
This <HI>Mariana,</HI> who&s;e Let|ters
you prai&s;e &s;o much, had carry'd on
her Pa&s;&s;ion to a great degree of extrava|gancy,
for a <HI>Frenchman,</HI> named, if I re|member
right, the Marque&s;s of <HI>Chamilly,</HI>
and believing that he had left her, Love,
mix't with De&s;pair, made her crack-brain'd.
To have the &s;ame Thoughts &s;he had, and
to write as &s;he does, you mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e
one to be Frenzical, or in Love to a degree
of Madne&s;s. I look upon this as a kind
of Love Euthu&s;ia&s;m; and if I &s;hould &s;ee
a young Lady expre&s;s her &s;elf in &s;uch like
terms, I &s;hould not know what to think
of her.</P>
<P>You would think, &s;aid I &s;miling, &s;he
was exce&s;&s;ively in Love. No doubt on't,
continued he, and that her Love was
rather founded upon her own humour,
than upon choice. I mu&s;t tell you, that,
for my part, I &s;hould rather choo&s;e
a mode&s;t, well temper'd and re&s;erved
Mi&s;tre&s;s, than one who is &s;o forward, and
has &s;o great a &s;hare of vivacity and activi|ty.
Every one according to his Mind, &s;aid
I, I mu&s;t confe&s;s I had framed to my&s;elf
an Idea of the Character of <HI>Donna Maria</HI>
which has not an&s;wered my expecta|tion.
I conjure you to write a Line to our
Friend, and de&s;ire him to &s;end us &s;ome|thing
that may prove more &s;atisfactory to
me. I can't but be mightily pleas'd at
your Fancy, <HI>My Lord,</HI> reply'd the Earl,
to give the Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI> the trouble
of furni&s;hing you with Arms to combat
<PB N="373" REF="234">
and vanqui&s;h him, for if you Love <HI>Donna
Maria,</HI> you mu&s;t be his Rival; and if you
are, he will make but &s;lender progre&s;s
in her Affection. Alas, <HI>My Lord,</HI> cry'd
I, what makes you &s;ay &s;o? The Duke is
hand&s;ome, lovely and young; whereas I
have &s;carce any thing el&s;e to recommend
me to the Ladies, but a good Air and
Mien, and &s;ome Gallantries; but it is a
hard Task to encounter with a young
Duke, who is no Novice in the Art of
plea&s;ing. If I have any hopes of flattering
my &s;elf with Succe&s;s, it is becau&s;e he
loved fir&s;t, and commonly the la&s;t has the
advantage over the re&s;t. The Earl of
<HI>Argyle</HI> could not forbear &s;miling at the
rea&s;on I alledg'd to back my hopes of
Succe&s;s; and Supper being ju&s;t then ready,
we went out of the Clo&s;et into the Dining-Room,
and thence afterwards every one
to his Bed Chamber.</P>
<P>I aro&s;e early the next Morning, and
finding the Earl (as yet) in Bed, I ask'd
my Lord, whither he was &s;till a&s;leep.
What &s;hould hinder me, cry'd he, 'tis e|nough
for you to haunt your Friends be|fore
Day break. I only came, &s;aid I, to
know whether you have writ or no. No,
an&s;wered he, upon better con&s;ideration I
think you had better go to <HI>London,</HI> where
you may &s;ee, in Per&s;on, the Lady for
whom you &s;uffer &s;o much already, per|haps
there you will find better Employ|ment,
than to enquire after her writing
well or ill. I mu&s;t confe&s;s, reply'd I, I
<PB N="374" REF="235">
am &s;omewhat unea&s;ie in the Matter, any
Man but my &s;elf would make much bet|ter
u&s;e of the King's Favour than I do at
this time, nay it is next door to a piece of
Ingratitude, to ab&s;ent my &s;elf from him
meerly to indulge my own Fancies. But
what would you have me &s;ay to you? I
am not the fir&s;t of that Kind, and were I
&s;ure to be the chief and mo&s;t happy Favou|rite
of the greate&s;t Monarch of the Univer&s;e,
I would prefer my Pa&s;&s;ion before my For|tune:
neither would have you imagine
this frailty to be peculiar only to my &s;elf;
no, I had it from my decea&s;ed Father,
he was the mo&s;t gallant Per&s;on in the
World, and perhaps you have heard &s;ome|thing
of his amorous Intreagues. I heard
of one, &s;aid the Earl, of an extraordinary
Nature, and &s;uch a one as &s;ufficiently
&s;hews he would carry on his Love-Pa&s;&s;ion
to the highe&s;t pitch.</P>
<P>I was told, continued he, that he was in
Love with a Per&s;on of &s;o high a Rank,
that he had but few opportunities of &s;ee|ing
her, e&s;pecially &s;ince his not coming
to Court mu&s;t have rendered his Conver|&s;ation
with the Lady very &s;u&s;picious to the
World. Reduced to tho&s;e Streights, he re|&s;olved
to equip a Ve&s;&s;el at his own charge;
under pretence of taking a Voyage, but in
effect to make the Ve&s;&s;el &s;trand in &s;ome
Creek or other, where he and his Atten|dance,
the Ma&s;&s;er and the Pilot (who were
at his Devotion) might &s;ave them&s;elves
without much Danger; with an intention
<PB N="375" REF="236">
to make the World believe they were
lo&s;t: This done, he intended to have en|tered
him&s;elf under the di&s;gui&s;e of a
Dome&s;tick Servant in the Lady's Service;
and to continue thus happy and &s;atisfy'd
all the remainder of his Days.</P>
<P>The Project, reply'd I, was thus con|certed,
but fail'd in the Execution; not
but that in all human probability, he
would by this means have encompa&s;s'd
his Ends of conver&s;ing with the Lady,
had not that Villain, who &s;tabb'd him, put
a fatal Period both to his Pa&s;&s;ion and Life
at once. He was, &s;aid the Earl of St. <HI>Al|bans,</HI>
interrupting the Duke, the hand|&s;ome&s;t
Man that ever was &s;een; he had a
way of making him&s;elf beloved by every
body, nay even by his Enemies. I have
run a&s;tray from my fir&s;t Subject, reply'd
the Duke of <HI>Buckingham,</HI> this being one
of the chiefe&s;t Conveniencies in the Con|ver&s;ation
of Friends, that you talk with|out
con&s;traint, and make what Digre&s;&s;ions
you think fit, without running the ri&s;que
of malicious Critici&s;m.</P>
<P>The Earl of <HI>Argyle</HI> did all he could to
per&s;uade me, that it was my Duty to get
forthwith to Court, but to no purpo&s;e, I
remaining re&s;olute not to leave <HI>Clevedom</HI>
till I was entirely di&s;po&s;ed to Love <HI>Donna
Maria de Balboza;</HI> becau&s;e without it,
<HI>I told him,</HI> I &s;hould at fir&s;t &s;ight be catch'd
again in the Snares of the Counte&s;s, and I
can't even di&s;own, that in vain I &s;trive to
avoid &s;peaking of her, and to forget every
<PB N="376" REF="237">
thing that may recal her to my mind: I
&s;igh in &s;pight of my &s;elf, I dread her en|gaging
with any body el&s;e, and, in &s;hort,
I &s;till feel certain motions of Jealou&s;y,
Anger and Unea&s;ine&s;s, and therefore have
no other way to put her out of my head,
than by another Engagement. Becau&s;e
you are &s;o re&s;olute, &s;aid the Earl, come,
let us write to the Duke; tho' it &s;eems
to me very odd, that a <HI>Billetdouce</HI>
only of the <HI>Portugueze</HI> Lady's writing,
&s;hould make you fall in love. Love,
cry'd I, is a capricious thing, and if you
&s;hould declare open War again&s;t me upon
that &s;core, 'tis impo&s;&s;ible for me to help
it. The Earl, who was now got out
of Bed, writ his Letter, without giving
me any farther an&s;wer. Having perus'd
the Letter, and found it &s;uitable to my
pre&s;ent Sentiments, I thank'd him, and
&s;ent it to the Duke, with another enclo|&s;ed
of my own writing. Unto which he
gave us an an&s;wer, which I am going to
read to you.</P>
<P>You are never to be &s;atisfied, and if the
young <HI>Portugueze</HI> writ day and night, I
que&s;tion whether you would be contented
and let me be at re&s;t. You would do well
to put &s;ome bounds to your De&s;ires, becau&s;e
&s;he is a little inclin'd to Lazine&s;s; and I
can't at this time &s;end you any thing of
hers, except a &s;mall Novel, which perhaps
may prove plea&s;ing to you: At the wor&s;t, my
Lords, it will give you an opportunity of
putting it into good order, and to add to it
<PB N="377" REF="238">
&s;uch Embelli&s;hments as may &s;till be want|ing

<P>THE Prince&s;&s;es of <HI>Bourgoes</HI> and of

Year to partake of the Diver&s;ions of the
<HI>Carnaval</HI> at <HI>Venice.</HI> They being prevented

from <HI>Rome</HI> to <HI>Florence,</HI> thence to <HI>Pi&s;a,</HI>
and &s;o to <HI>Lucea,</HI> to take a view of that
City. In the&s;e little Journeys, as they
were attended only by a &s;mall Retinue,
&s;o they would often ride on Hor&s;eback
di&s;gui&s;ed in Mens Apparel; and the Ladies
that were of their Company did the like
out of Complai&s;ance to the Prince&s;&s;es.
The Prince&s;s of <HI>Bourgoes</HI> had a certain
favourite Lady, her near Relation, nam'd
<HI>Donna Pamfilia,</HI> who being extreamly
well &s;hap'd and featur'd, but withal &s;ome|what
large, had the perfect Air of a
hand&s;om Man; &s;o that this Dre&s;s be|coming
her to admiration, &s;he was one of
the mo&s;t forward for thus di&s;gui&s;ing her|&s;elf:
The Prince&s;s being no le&s;s fond to
&s;ee her in this Garb, commanded &s;trictly
<PB N="378" REF="239">
all her Dome&s;ticks, not to di&s;cover <HI>Pam|filia</HI>
to be a young Lady; &s;o &s;he went by

<P>The Prince&s;&s;es, upon their arrival at
<HI>Lucea,</HI> took up their Quarters at the Sa|nator
<HI>Nerli,</HI> who had a very &s;pacious

Company. The Prince&s;s of <HI>Sonnino,</HI> be|ing
one of the hand&s;ome&s;t Ladies of all
<HI>Italy,</HI> became here the admiration of all
that &s;aw her, the young <HI>Camilla,</HI> Daugh|ter
of the Senator <HI>Nerli,</HI> being the only
who could &s;tand in competition with her.
The Prince&s;&s;es met with a mo&s;t honoura|ble

who was one of the chiefe&s;t and

what makes you &s;o melancholy and re|&s;erv'd,

Confident, and be a&s;&s;ured I will omit no|thing

Lady, this is none of my de&s;ign, but I
dare not name her. And if I &s;hould gue&s;s

condition, &s;aid <HI>Pamfilio,</HI> that I may
not incur your di&s;plea&s;ure, I will own it

<P>Why, Madam, would you ask me whe|ther

I am confident I know none; and am &s;en&s;i|ble,

<P>I am not &s;o far prepo&s;&s;e&s;s'd with my own
Merits, as to imagine that you could love
nothing but me. When I enquir'd after the
Secret of your Heart, I expected no farther
&s;hare in it than that of a Confident. How|ever,
<PB N="381" REF="242">
I will not di&s;own but that I have too
high an e&s;teem for you to look upon your
Declaration with an indifferent eye: If
your de&s;ire of plea&s;ing me is unfeigned, I
promi&s;e you, upon my Word, I will put
it to a good account.</P>
<P><HI>Pamfilia</HI> run &s;trait with this Billet to
the Prince&s;&s;es, who making it the &s;ub|ject
of their Di&s;ver&s;ion and Mirth for a
whole day, <HI>Camilla</HI> writ another in the&s;e
Words.</P>
<P>I can &s;carce expre&s;s to you, <HI>Signior
Pamfilio,</HI> the Pain I have endur'd all this
day; I expected to have &s;een you; my
Eyes did &s;earch for you in every Corner,
but could not meet with you: Can you love
me after &s;o ea&s;ie a way?</P>
<P><HI>Pamfilia</HI> immediately writ this An|&s;wer.</P>
<P>You are not much out of humour, Ma|dam,
for not having &s;een me to day, be|cau&s;e
you &s;hew your goodne&s;s even when
you &s;uppo&s;e me to have given you &s;ufficient
rea&s;on of wi&s;hing me ill. Truly, your Re|proaches
are &s;o obliging, that let my lo&s;e
be never &s;o great in pa&s;&s;ing a day without
you, I can't repent of it; and I will frank|ly
own to you, that I ta&s;t much more plea|&s;ure
in reading by my&s;elf your Billet, than
to &s;ee you &s;urrounded with a crowd of Peo|ple,
who are que&s;tionle&s;s my Rivals, and
perhaps preferr'd by you before me. Alas!
was my Heart at as much ea&s;e as you charge
it with, I &s;hould not feel the&s;e in&s;en&s;ible mo|tions
of Jealou&s;ie. Don't refu&s;e me an
<PB N="382" REF="243">
opportunity of a few Minutes, where I
may declare that I adore you.</P>
<P><HI>Camilla</HI> return'd the following An&s;wer
the next day.</P>
<P>I am not a&s;ham'd to own, that you plea&s;e
me exceedingly, that I take a plea&s;ure in
&s;eeing you, and that I can't reflect upon
the nece&s;&s;ity of your ab&s;ence without Pain;
yet I &s;hould never forgive my&s;elf if I &s;hould
give you an opportunity of &s;eeing me in
private. Did I e&s;teem you le&s;s, you would
appear le&s;s dangerous to me. Re&s;t &s;atisfy'd
with what I tell you, and never look for
an opportunity of &s;eeing me in private.</P>
<P><HI>Pamfilia</HI> &s;oon after &s;eeing <HI>Camilla,</HI> told
her; Truly, Madam, your Favours are
attended with too much trouble and pain,
you flatter me as if I were not indifferent
to you, and treat me wor&s;e than if I
actually was &s;o: For, what can be more
cruel to me, than your commands of not
&s;eeing you in private? This was done,
&s;aid <HI>Camilla</HI> to him, becau&s;e if I &s;hould
give way to tho&s;e favourable Di&s;po&s;itions
I have for you, I might perhaps not re|main
long &s;o far Mi&s;tre&s;s of my&s;elf, as
to &s;hun you when it ought to be done.
And what can oblige you, reply'd <HI>Pam|filia,</HI>
to &s;hun me? The more you are ac|quainted
with me, the le&s;s danger you
will apprehend in my Conver&s;ation. I
am too &s;en&s;ible, reply'd &s;he with a Blu&s;h,
of the Sentiments of my Heart; and be|cau&s;e
you are &s;o urgent to know the rea|&s;on
that moves me to &s;hun you, I mu&s;t
<PB N="383" REF="244">
give you an account of my Misfor|tunes.</P>
<P>Know then, <HI>Pamfilio,</HI> that a certain
<HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Gentleman, of the Family of the
Dukes of <HI>Norfolk,</HI> coming to <HI>Lucea,</HI> I
happen'd to &s;ee him the fir&s;t time at a
Fea&s;t, which the Great Duke of <HI>Florence</HI>
(who comes hither &s;ometimes) gave to
the Ladies. There being at the &s;ame time
a Ball, and this Stranger dancing among
the re&s;t, I conceiv'd in his Per&s;on all the
Charms that can po&s;&s;ibly be &s;uppos'd to
be the effects of a fine Air and Mien,
mix'd with Youth and Beauty. If my
Eyes did betray my Sentiments, his ap|pear'd
no le&s;s favourably di&s;pos'd for me;
and after having left off dancing, and
gain'd the applau&s;e of all the Company,
he plac'd him&s;elf ju&s;t by me. I thought
I ought not to refu&s;e him my approba|tion;
and looking upon him with a mo&s;t
obliging Air, told him, Sir, you have
gain'd the admiration of all the Company;
and, as for my&s;elf, I confe&s;s I never &s;aw
any one dance with a better grace and
more exactne&s;s in all my life. If it be
&s;o, Madam, &s;aid he, that this Company
has thought fit to give me their approba|tion,
nothing affects me more &s;en&s;ibly
than yours in particular. At the &s;ame
time, I dare affirm to you, that I feel
within me &s;uch Sentiments for your Per|&s;on,
as may much better entitle me to
the Favour you have been pleas'd to afford
me. Re&s;t &s;atisfy'd with what you have
<PB N="384" REF="245">
receiv'd, &s;aid I &s;miling, po&s;&s;ibly when
you are better known&mdash;Here an old
rigorous Kin&s;woman, with whom I was
come to the Fea&s;t, interrupted me, whi|&s;pering
in my Ear, it was not decent to
talk with a Stranger, and unle&s;s I broke
off the Conver&s;ation; &s;he would tell my
Father. After this I dur&s;t not &s;peak one
word more to my Lord, but my Eyes told
him &s;ufficiently, that my &s;ilence was the
effect of &s;ome con&s;traint.</P>
<P>The Idea of his Per&s;on had made &s;o
&s;trong an impre&s;&s;ion upon my Heart, that
I did not &s;leep one wink all that night;
but the next day, as I was contriving all
po&s;&s;ible means to talk with him, in comes
he, towards the Evening, with an Ac|quaintance
of my Father's. You may
judge how I was pleas'd with this agreea|ble
Surprize; e&s;pecially when the Friend
that introduc'd him, told me, that he had
brought me a mo&s;t excellent Dancing-|Ma&s;ter,
who, in a &s;mall time, would
teach me how to dance <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Country
Dances; which my Father being willing
I &s;hould learn, and coming into the Room
at the &s;ame time, he told him the &s;ame
Story, whereat my Father was &s;o well
pleas'd, that he would &s;ee him give me
the fir&s;t Le&s;&s;on. He perform'd his Part
&s;o nicely and naturally, that he would
have deceiv'd any body. Whil&s;t we were
dancing, he conjur'd me to tell him whe|ther
I thought this <HI>Metamorpho&s;is</HI> an Ob|ligation,
&s;ince I might be a&s;&s;ur'd that what
<PB N="385" REF="246">
he did, proceeded from a Heart full of ten|der
Inclinations; that if he prov'd &s;o un|fortunate
as to find me in&s;en&s;ible, he de|&s;ir'd
I might declare it frankly, that &s;o he
might endeavour to cure him&s;elf of a
Pa&s;&s;ion, the very beginning whereof had
already made &s;uch a lively impre&s;&s;ion up|on
his Heart, that he had all the rea&s;on
in the world to fear he &s;hould not be able
to ma&s;ter it hereafter. I told him, he
puzled me with &s;uch a blunt. Que&s;tion,
that the Pre&s;ence of my Father hinder'd
my giving him an an&s;wer, but if he
would come again to morrow, he would
much oblige me.</P>
<P>My Father being well plea&s;ed with the
Dexterity of my new Ma&s;ter, he came
again the next day; and being then at li|berty
to talk, What mu&s;t be my De&s;tiny?
&s;aid he: Will you permit me, Madam,
to love you; and have &s;o much Goodne&s;s
as not to hate me? The &s;ame moment
my Father entring the Room, his Pre&s;ence
robb'd me of the opportunity of return|ing
an an&s;wer, at lea&s;t, &s;uch as I would;
&s;o all what I could &s;ay, with a low
Voice, was, <HI>Love, and you may plea&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>My Father not &s;taying long, he was
no &s;ooner gone, but my Lord continu'd,
Oh! Madam, how happy am I, if to
plea&s;e you requires only to love you! A
Per&s;on of &s;uch high Merit as yours, re|ply'd
I blu&s;hing, need nothing el&s;e than
love to plea&s;e. But, continu'd <HI>Camilla,</HI>
I will not rehear&s;e all the Particulars of
<PB N="386" REF="247">
our Conver&s;ation, but only tell you, That
I never pa&s;s'd my Time, all the Days of my
life, with more plea&s;ure and &s;atisfaction,
than during this lovely Stranger's coming
to our Hou&s;e, which was every day. Things
were come to &s;uch a pa&s;s, that we were
contriving only the mo&s;t proper Methods
of making my Father con&s;ent to our Mar|riage;
and the Great Duke of <HI>Tu&s;cany</HI>
having engag'd him&s;elf to u&s;e all his In|tere&s;t
with my Father in my Lord's be|half,
the day for putting this Que&s;tion
was fix'd; when one of my Father's
Friends, more &s;ullen and jealous than
wi&s;e, having got the &s;cent of my Lord's
coming to our Hou&s;e under the di&s;gui&s;e
of a Dancing-Ma&s;ter, thought the Affront
was not to be wiped off, but with the
lo&s;s of his Life. Accordingly he di&s;co|vers
the whole amorous Intreague to my
Father, and all its pretended Con&s;equen|ces,
and that in &s;o heinous a manner, as
put my Father beyond all bounds of Mo|deration.
During this his furious Pa&s;&s;ion,
he dream'd of nothing el&s;e, than my ha|ving
&s;acrific'd my Reputation to my Lo|ver's
Pa&s;&s;ion; and upon that Suppo&s;ition
(which he took ab&s;olutely for granted)
he re&s;olv'd to &s;acrifice him to his Ha|tred.</P>
<P>It happen'd very fortunately, that
whil&s;t my Father was concerting Mea|&s;ures,
with his before-nam'd Friend, to
have him &s;tabb'd without any noi&s;e, they
thought fit to communicate the matter to
<PB N="387" REF="248">
a certain Gentleman, a bold Fellow, who
being in my Father's Service, he put an
entire Confidence in. By good chance
I had &s;ome time before acquainted him
with what had pa&s;s'd betwixt my Lord
and I; and he looking upon the matter
with quite another eye than my Father,
he forewarn'd me of the danger of my
Lover, and that unle&s;s he &s;oon departed
the place, he could not be an&s;werable for
his Life, my Father having vow'd his
De&s;truction. But, reply'd I, if my Fa|ther
is once convinc'd of his Extraction
and his Merits, que&s;tionle&s;s he will not
per&s;i&s;t in his Pa&s;&s;ion. No, Madam, &s;ays
he, don't flatter your&s;elf, I my&s;elf have
try'd him there. I told him who he was,
and how he was back'd by the Intere&s;t of
the Great Duke; which &s;erv'd only to
furni&s;h him with fre&s;h Matter for his
Pa&s;&s;ion. What, &s;aid he, a Per&s;on of Qua|lity
and Merits to go to di&s;honour my
Hou&s;e, and under &s;o &s;candalous a Di&s;|gui&s;e
to get the opportunity of &s;eeing my
Daughter! The Traytor &s;hall die for it,
or I will die my&s;elf.</P>
<P>I was fully convinc'd, added <HI>Camilla,</HI>
by the di&s;cour&s;e of this Gentleman, that
I mu&s;t re&s;olve to per&s;uade my Lord to
ab&s;ent him&s;elf, unle&s;s I would &s;ee his
Life expos'd to a thou&s;and dangers. Pray
con&s;ider what a cruel Task this was to
me, to be employ'd in procuring the ab|&s;ence
of a Per&s;on the deare&s;t to me in the
world. But as after all no other Misfor|tune
<PB N="388" REF="249">
appear'd to me comparable, or what
I would not willingly &s;ubmit to, than that
which made me dread &s;ome fatal Event
in his Per&s;on, and that no time was to
be lo&s;t to adverti&s;e him of the danger; I
conjur'd the &s;ame Gentleman, whom they
intended to make the In&s;trument of his
De&s;truction, to lend me a helping hand
in &s;aving him. My Entreaties prov'd &s;o
effectual, that he (tho' not without a
great deal of difficulty) undertook to de|liver
unto him, from me, the following
Letter.</P>
<P>Tho' I have all the rea&s;on in the world
to believe that in lo&s;ing you I &s;hall lo&s;e all
the Repo&s;e and the only Satisfaction of my
life, yet indi&s;pen&s;able nece&s;&s;ity forces me
to conjure you to depart; my Father is too
far overcome by the fury of his Pa&s;&s;ion for
me to expect, without dread or horror, the
effects thereof. He fancies I not only love
you, but have given you &s;uch proofs of it,
as are little becoming his Honour and
Blood. I mu&s;t tell you, to the &s;hame of my
native Country, Poi&s;ons and Daggers are
&s;et to work here, and nothing is look'd
upon as unbecoming a Man, to revenge
his Honour. How can you &s;uppo&s;e to &s;e|cure
your &s;elf always again&s;t &s;uch clan|de&s;tine
De&s;igns? You will never be able
to e&s;cape the Snares, the&s;e Methods being
directly oppo&s;ite to the generous Actions of
your Country; and &s;uppo&s;ing you could be
&s;o fortunate as to e&s;cape the Danger, con|&s;ider
what Torments I &s;hould continually
<PB N="389" REF="250">
be expos'd to, without any hopes of a De|liverance.
Did my Father's Fury aim at
my life only, you &s;hould find me to expo&s;e
my Per&s;on with &s;uch an undaunted Re&s;o|lution,
as perhaps would &s;urprize you:
But alas! your &s;hare is the greater of the
two, and I confe&s;s, without a blu&s;h, that I
find in my&s;elf all the Frailties of my Sex,
and of a Lover. Depart then, I beg it of
you upon that Friend&s;hip you have vow'd
to me with &s;o much tenderne&s;s; depart for
my Reputation's, and for your own &s;ake.
Oh! what is it I &s;ay? This Command will
co&s;t me very dear. Don't charge me there|fore
with laying it upon you without pain;
you would do me the greate&s;t piece of In|ju&s;tice
to &s;u&s;pect my Heart; but only that
I can't &s;ee you continue in a place where
you have to do with &s;uch dangerous Ene|mies.
Don't increa&s;e the Mi&s;ery of one of
the mo&s;t unhappy Per&s;ons in the Univer&s;e,
by the addition of &s;uch cruel Circum|&s;tances;
but remember I love you at &s;o
uncommon a rate, that I would &s;acrifice
my Life only to deliver you from the ap|pearance
of Dangers that threaten yours.
Remember farther, that our Per&s;ecutor is
my Father, that you can't do any thing a|gain&s;t
him, but I mu&s;t feel the Blow at &s;e|cond
hand; and that after all, your depar|ture,
which perhaps will co&s;t me my Life,
is the only Favour I can ask of you; and
I ask it as an effect of that Obedience
whereby you will pre&s;erve for ever the po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion
of my Heart. O good God! my
<PB N="390" REF="251">
Strength fails me, my Torments overcome
me; depart, compa&s;&s;ionate and love me.</P>
<P>My Tears almo&s;t effaced the Characters
of my Letters; however I gave it to the
Gentleman before mention'd, who deli|ver'd
it to my Lord, and told him what
el&s;e I had charged him with. He con|tinu'd
for a long time in &s;u&s;pence, his
Soul being di&s;tracted by mo&s;t violent and
contrary Pa&s;&s;ions: But at la&s;t re&s;olving
to depart, he writ the&s;e Lines.</P>
<P>I am going to depart, Madam; 'tis
enough that you have comman$$d it for the
pre&s;ervation of my Life; but I can a&s;&s;ure
you, this Command will not &s;erve to pro|tract
it long; my ab&s;ence will &s;erve in&s;tead
of Poi&s;on and Dagger to the unju&s;t Re|venge
of your Father. I &s;hall die, Madam,
but remember, 'tis for obeying your Com|mands.</P>
<P>The reading of this Billet touch'd me
&s;o to the quick, that I wonder I did not
lo&s;e all my Sen&s;es; and my Lord having
ab&s;ented him&s;elf pur&s;uant to my de&s;ire, I
now began to repent of what I had done;
but after all, when I &s;eriou&s;ly reflected
upon the Danger that threatned him, I
was forced to be contented as well as I
could. My Father not que&s;tioning but
that his &s;udden retreat from hence was
the effect of being adverti&s;ed of his
De&s;ign, thought it neverthele&s;s not con|venient
to reprimand me on account
of what had pa&s;s'd, for fear of wor&s;e
con&s;equences, but took a Re&s;olution of
<PB N="391" REF="252">
marrying me out of hand, to be rid of
the trouble of watching the Conduct
of a young Woman; but hitherto no
Match that was thought &s;uitable has of|fered
it &s;elf. I began, by the help of my
Rea&s;on, and my Lord's Ab&s;ence, to forget
him by degrees; notwith&s;tanding which,
I felt certain frail and tender Intervals,
which, as it made me di&s;tru&s;t my &s;trength,
&s;o I avoided all opportunities of hearing
any News from him. Upon your arival
here, tho' I own your Merits are very
great, yet I &s;hould &s;carce have had &s;uch a
favourable di&s;po&s;ition towards you, had
it not been for the re&s;emblance you have
to my Lover: I no &s;ooner &s;aw you, but
I thought I &s;aw him; the &s;ame Features,
nay the &s;ame Voice; &s;o that my poor
Heart, betwixt &s;uch a &s;urprize and flattery,
&s;uffered it&s;elf to be carry'd away to love
you. But let us take heed, not to let
loo&s;e the reigns of our Pa&s;&s;ion; I have rea|&s;on
to remember the la&s;t. I know I am
unfortunate; you &s;ee how I was forced to
break off with what I loved &s;o dearly:
Alas! what ought I not to dread upon
your account? Here &s;he &s;topt, and <HI>Pam|filia,</HI>
mo&s;t &s;en&s;ibly touch'd with the &s;ince|rity
of this fair Per&s;on, judged &s;he ought
no longer to abu&s;e her Credulity; &s;he di&s;|cover'd
her Sex, asking her a thou&s;and Par|dons
for this plea&s;ant Impo&s;ture. <HI>Pamfi|lia</HI>
was not a litrle vex'd at the Mat|ter;
but conceal'd it, returning her
many Thanks for having recall'd her out
<PB N="392" REF="253">
of an Error, which in time might have
co&s;t her very dear; and the Prince&s;&s;es of

<HEAD>The End of the Novel.</HEAD>
<P>I continued in &s;o &s;plenetick a Humour
that the Earl of <HI>Argyle,</HI> being &s;urprized
thereat, told me; What, don't you prai&s;e
this little Novel? Don't you reli&s;h it? Or,
do you want &s;till another peice of <HI>Donna
Maria,</HI> to &s;upport your re&s;olution of
loving her? One mu&s;t be very difficult in|deed,
&s;aid I, not to be &s;atisfy'd with what
I ju&s;t now read: But don't you &s;ee, as
well as I, that the whole is her own
Hi&s;tory, and that &s;he has only repre&s;ented
it under borrow'd Names, and fix'd the
Scene in another Country. I don't &s;ee
that, reply'd the Earl, &s;uch like Adven|tures
happen every day, and are known
and written. No, no, reply'd I, &s;he is
too particular for any other but her&s;elf;
&s;he is the <HI>Camilla.</HI> Good God! what a
Letter is here, continued I, reading the
Billet &s;he &s;ent to my Lord, to command
$im to depart; how nicely &s;til'd&punc; and
how full of love! Without doubt &s;he &s;till
loves him, and her Father, not knowing
what to do with her, thought he could
not pitch upon a better expedient to cure
her Pa&s;&s;ion, than to &s;end her away. This
is the true cau&s;e of her Voyage, 'tis this
<PB N="393" REF="254">
that has brought her to our Court, and
that with a Heart prepo&s;e&s;s'd with a
tender Pa&s;&s;ion; judge what I am going to
do, to go about to encounter a beloved
Rival, and to plea&s;e a Per&s;on gained be|fore
by another.</P>
<P>I am &s;urprized, &s;aid the Earl, you &s;hould
be &s;o unea&s;ie, as if you were to encounter
with Mon&s;ters; methinks you appear &s;o
little like your&s;elf, that both my Eyes
are &s;carce &s;ufficient to convince me it is
you I &s;peak to. I mu&s;t confe&s;s, &s;aid I,
that I begin to be a&s;ham'd of my Frailty;
but what is it I can alledge in my own
behalf? I find my&s;elf &s;eized already with
a mo&s;t violent Pa&s;&s;ion, and what Follies
are not we guilty of, during the&s;e fir&s;t ir|regular
Motions of our Hearts? Come,
let's go to <HI>London,</HI> continued I, <HI>Donna
Maria</HI> will, by her Wit, by the Jealou&s;ies
and Inquietudes &s;he makes me feel already,
&s;oon put me in a condition of overcoming
my Pa&s;&s;ion for the Counte&s;s; come, let
us go and in&s;ult over the Charms of this
faithle&s;s Woman, and pay our homage to
the <HI>Portugueze</HI> Lady.</P>
<P>The Earl being almo&s;t tired with our
&s;tay at <HI>Clevedom,</HI> was glad of this oppor|tunity
of returning to <HI>Whitehall,</HI> without
leaving me behind in the Country. Up|on
the Road he heard me &s;ay nothing but
what related to the lovely <HI>Balboza.</HI> I
read her Novel over and over, which
&s;erv'd only to confirm me in my opinion,
that &s;he loved &s;omebody or other. 'Tis

true, in the mid&s;t of all my Sufferings, I
found &s;ome Comfort, when I con&s;ider'd,
that &s;he had not &s;een her Lover for a long
time; I flatter'd my&s;elf, that &s;he retain'd,
as yet, &s;o much of his Idea in her Mind,
as might make her &s;tand her ground a|gain&s;t
the Addre&s;&s;es of the Duke of <HI>Mon|mouth,</HI>
and that I might find an opportu|nity
of courting her with &s;uch &s;ucce&s;s, as
to get the better both of her ab&s;ent Lover,
and of the young Duke. With this con|fu&s;ion
of Thoughts I came to <HI>London.</HI>
After having paid my Re&s;pects to the
King, who gave me a reception &s;uitable
to his wonted Goodne&s;s, and chid me on
account ofmy long &s;tay in the Country,
the rea&s;on whereof he had been inform'd
of much better than I thought he had;
I went to the great Appartment, where
the Queen ju&s;t then kept the Circle. The
fir&s;t thing that offered it&s;elf to my view
was the Counte&s;s, a thou&s;and times hand|&s;omer
than ever I &s;aw her before, and
the young <HI>Portugueze,</HI> meagre and brown,
but very well featur'd, excellent good
Teeth, and her Eyes &s;ufficient to tame the
fierce&s;t Heart upon Earth.</P>
<P>As &s;he had never &s;een me before, &s;o &s;he
lo$k'd &s;teadfa&s;t upon me, whil&s;t &s;he was
$alking with my Lady <HI>H&mdash;,</HI> which
made me imagine, that &s;he ask'd her my
Name. Highly plea&s;ed with this piece of
curio&s;ity in her, I drew nearer, and told her,
Pray Madam, ask not my Name from any
body but my&s;elf; I am come to Court on
<PB N="395" REF="256">
purpo&s;e to tell it you. She being &s;urprized,
blu&s;h'd at &s;o extraordinary a Complement,
and &s;aid, And who has told you, my Lord,
that my Di&s;cour&s;e was concerning you?
You mu&s;t certainly be very quick, that I
cou'd &s;carce open my Mouth, but you
know what I &s;aid. My Lady <HI>H</HI>&mdash;
then interrupting our Di&s;cour&s;e, and my
aim being to make my&s;elf appear as agree|able
as po&s;&s;ibly I cou'd, I made u&s;e of all
the &s;prightline&s;s of my Wit, and a cer|tain
diverting Air, which proved not di&s;|plea&s;ing
to <HI>Donna Maria.</HI> But during
our Conver&s;ation, the Counte&s;s being very
attentive upon all that pa&s;s'd, and the
Duke of <HI>Monmouth,</HI> who al&s;o claim'd
an Intere&s;t in her, (as he told me but
a few days ago) were both ready to run
di&s;tracted to &s;ee me conver&s;e &s;o frankly
with <HI>Balboza,</HI> as if our Acquaintance had
been of &s;ome Years &s;tanding. Out of re|&s;pect
to the Queen&punc; we could not di&s;|cour&s;e
together &s;o long as I could have
wi&s;h'd, and I had not the lea&s;t opportu|nity
of coming near her again that Even|ing.</P>
<P>I was no &s;ooner return'd to my Lodg|ings,
but the Dutche&s;s of <HI>B&mdash;m,</HI> who
had &s;een me talk to the young <HI>Portugeze,</HI>
ask'd me, whither her Wit had not charm'd
me? I an&s;wered, with an affected Indiffe|rency,
that I cou'd find no Wonders in her;
that &s;he had a great vivacity of Thoughts,
but it was impo&s;&s;ible &s;uch fiery no|tions
&s;hould be accompany'd with a &s;ound
<PB N="396" REF="257">
Judgment, and that I never was fond of a
Head without Brain. She makes a great
noi&s;e, continued &s;he; and as the Queen
&s;hews her a great deal of Favour, &s;o mo&s;t
of the Ladies have entertain'd her at Din|ner.
I, in my turn, have agreed with the
Dutche&s;s of <HI>Richmond,</HI> my Lady <HI>H</HI>&mdash;
and the Counte&s;s of <HI>Fe&s;mouth,</HI> to carry
her abroad to <HI>Sion Hill.</HI> And, reply'd
I briskly, Why, would you invite only
Women? No, &s;aid &s;he, the Duke of
<HI>Monmouth</HI> and the Earl of S. <HI>Albans</HI>
would have given any thing to have been
of the Company; but the Queen, who
is &s;en&s;ible of their Pa&s;&s;ion for <HI>Donna
Maria,</HI> would perhaps have taken it a|mi&s;s;
&s;o that in&s;tead of courting her Fa|vour,
as I intend to do, I &s;hould have got
her Anger. I commended her Prudence, but
at the &s;ame time told her, that the Queen
would not be again&s;t my going along with
them, and that I intended to bring along
with me the Earls of <HI>Argyle,</HI> of <HI>O</HI>&mdash;
and Mr.&mdash;<HI>Porter,</HI> he being a Per&s;on of
&s;o gay and merry a Temper, that I was
certain the Ladies wou'd be very well
pleas'd with his Company.</P>
<P>And can you imagine, reply'd &s;he, that
he can be gay in any place where the
Dutche&s;s of <HI>Richmond</HI> is? and that after
all his preten&s;ions, and the game he has
play'd her, he will not rather affect a &s;e|rious
Air and Countenance? I bur&s;t out a
laughing; truly, &s;aid I, he is not apt to
lay things thus to Heart, he ma$$s a game
<PB N="397" REF="258">
of it all. Oh, cry'd &s;he, make him believe
&s;o if you can; I &s;han't forget what he
told me but two days ago. And what
did he tell you, &s;aid I? All, &s;aid &s;he,
what a Man reduced to De&s;pair is able to
&s;ay. So, you are catch'd in the Trap, con|tinu'd
I. And &s;o wou'd all the World as
well as my&s;elf, &s;aid &s;he, and without
doubt I am not altogether in the wrong,
to complain of your Si&s;ter. Give me
leave to interrupt you, &s;aid the Earl of
<HI>A&mdash;n,</HI> and to ask you, my Lord, what
was the occa&s;ion of the falling out be|twixt
the Dutche&s;s of <HI>Richmond</HI> and Mr.
<HI>Porter.</HI> Are you the only Man at Court,
&s;aid the Earl of S. <HI>A</HI>&mdash;, that is a &s;tranger
to it? However, things &s;ometimes hap|pening
thus, that near Relations know
le&s;s of them than others, I will, whil&s;t
my Lord Duke takes a little breathing|time,
give you an account of this Adven|ture.</P>
<P>The Dutche&s;s of <HI>Richmond</HI> was &s;carce
Eleven Years of Age when &s;he was marry'd
to my Lord <HI>Herbert,</HI> Son to the Earl of
<HI>Pembrook;</HI> but he dying &s;oon after, &s;he
appear'd at Court in her Widows Garb,
whil&s;t &s;he was yet a Child; and tho' her
Features were at that time not framed
to their full perfection, yet &s;he was
look'd upon as a Per&s;on, who in time
wou'd prove the greate&s;t Beauty in
<HI>England.</HI> One day &s;he was got up into a
Tree in the King's little Garden, to ga|ther
&s;om$ Fruit, and nobody being per|mitted
<PB N="398" REF="259">
to come&punc; in there; this, together
with her black Ga$b and long Veil, which
being &s;pread over the Twigs of the Tree,
look'd like Wings, made the King, who
perceiv'd her at a good di&s;tance, ima|gine,
that &s;ome &s;trange Bird had perch'd
in the Tree. Mr.&mdash;<HI>Porter,</HI> a young
Courtier, and much in favour with the
King; being a hand&s;ome Per&s;on, and ex|treamly
Gallant and Diverting in Conver|&s;ation,
was then with him; and the King
knowing him to be an exact Marks Man;
told him, you mu&s;t kill this large Bird
which I &s;ee in one of the Trees of my
little Garden. Mr. <HI>Porter</HI> looking for
&s;ome time towards the place, and finding
the Bird out of reach of his Ball, told
the King he would take his Fu&s;ee,
and in a moment bring him the But|terfly:
But he was ready to bur&s;t with
laughing, when, approaching the Tree, he
found the young Counte&s;s; who &s;mil'd
at him with an innocent Air, pelted him
with the Fruit &s;he had gather'd; whil&s;t he
took more peculiar notice, than ever he
had done before, of her Beauty, the cleer|ne&s;s
of her Skin, and the brightne&s;s of
her Eyes; every thing appear'd infinitely
charming to him; &s;o that when he reflect|ed
upon what de&s;ign he was come thither,
he cou'd not forgive him&s;elf; &s;ometimes
h$ look'd upon her, then upon his Fu&s;ee,
w$thout being able to &s;peak one word for
him&s;elf. <HI>What have you there</HI> Porter,
&s;aid &s;he, <HI>What can't you &s;peak? Are you
<PB N="399" REF="260">
bewitch'd?</HI> Oh, Madam, reply'd he, did
you know what brought me hither, you
wou'd be &s;en&s;ible I have &s;ufficient rea&s;on
to be &s;urprized. The King happening to
e&s;py you in the Tree, and taking you for
a Bird; gue&s;s upon what errant I was &s;ent
hither. <HI>What,</HI> cry'd &s;he, <HI>to kill me? Yes,
to kill you Madam,</HI> &s;aid I; I promi&s;ed to
bring the King &s;ome of your Feathers.
<HI>Hah, hah,</HI> &s;aid &s;he laughing, you mu&s;t be
as good as your word; we will play a
merry Game with him: I will put my|&s;elf
into a large Hamper, and &s;o be car|ry'd
into his Appartment. She &s;ent im|mediately
for a Hamper; and one of her
Gentlemen taking hold on one and
Mr. <HI>Porter</HI> on the other end, he told her
a thou&s;and pretty things, as they went a|long;
unto which &s;he an&s;wer'd, with a
great vivacity of Wit, and &s;o pa&s;s'd her
time plea&s;antly enough in the Hamper?
Mr. <HI>Porter</HI> pre&s;enting it to the King, told
him, he had had the good fortune to take
the Butterfly alive; which was &s;o beauti|ful,
that had he kill'd it, he &s;hou'd never
have out-liv'd it him&s;elf. His Maje&s;ty,
eager to &s;ee it, opens the Hamper, and
the young Counte&s;s cla&s;ping her Arms a|bout
his Neck, furni&s;h'd matter for a
mo&s;t agreeable &s;urprize. 'Tis not to be
admired, that &s;he embraced the King in &s;o
familiar a way, every body knows they
were bred up together, and he look'd up|on
her no otherwi&s;e than his own Si&s;ter.
Ever &s;ince that time, &s;he has been known
<PB N="400" REF="261">
by the Name of <HI>Butterfly,</HI> and in &s;everal
Courts of <HI>Europe,</HI> that name is oftner
given her, than her own Title.</P>
<P><HI>Porter</HI> fell &s;o deeply in Love with this
growing Beauty, that he could &s;carce live
without &s;eeing her, but dur&s;t not give a
free cour&s;e to his Pa&s;&s;ion; becau&s;e &s;he
was afterwards marry'd to the Duke of
<HI>Richmond,</HI> and by her high Rank of being
a Prince&s;s of the Blood Royal, infinitely
above him, (tho' he was one of the mo&s;t
accompli&s;h'd Per&s;ons of the Court) he
lo&s;t all hopes of gaining her Affections.
As he believ'd that another Love Pa&s;&s;ion
might be able to ra&s;e out of his Heart
that which had taken ab&s;olute po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion
there before, he entred into an amorous
Engagement with one Mrs. <HI>L&mdash;g,</HI> a
Player, whom he took along with him
into the Country, in hopes that the
&s;weetne&s;s of her Conver&s;ation might
prove a cure to his Love. The King,
who knew nothing of his Affections for
the Dutche&s;s of <HI>Richmond,</HI> would &s;hew
&s;ometimes his di&s;like at his ab&s;ence from
Court; but he an&s;wer'd only with &s;ilence,
and continu'd his cour&s;e. The Troubles
that aro&s;e about that time in <HI>England,</HI>
put a &s;top to the Pa&s;&s;ion of Mr. <HI>Porter.</HI>
The Dutche&s;s of <HI>Richmond,</HI> now once
more a Widow, went along with the
Queen-Mother into <HI>France,</HI> in the Qua|lity
of her Lady of the Bed Chamber;
where by the example of that great Prin|ce&s;s,
and by her own Experience, &s;he had
<PB N="401" REF="262">
&s;ufficient occa&s;ion to learn, that even Per|&s;ons
of a mo&s;t exalted Fortune, and who
&s;eem to be fix'd upon the mo&s;t firm ba&s;is
that can be laid, are &s;ubject to great
Chances: She, who was Beautiful even to
Perfection, and who had appear'd with
no le&s;s Magnificence than if &s;he were a
Queen, finding her&s;elf reduced to want
&s;ome Nece&s;&s;aries; for I heard her declare
my&s;elf, that one Summer &s;he had often
occa&s;ion for Gloves, not being able to wear
them dirty, and wanting Mony to buy new
ones.</P>
<P>But without in&s;i&s;ting farther upon
moral Reflexions, I mu&s;t tell you, that her
Heart was not &s;o in&s;en&s;ible at <HI>Paris,</HI> as
it had been at <HI>London;</HI> and to divert her
melancholly hours, &s;he gave a favourable
ear to Mr. <HI>Howard,</HI> a Gentleman of merit,
hand&s;om, and full of gallantry, (as you
know your&s;elf) who, as well as many
more, had left <HI>England,</HI> and was fall'n
pa&s;&s;ionately in Love with the Dutche&s;s.
At fir&s;t &s;he received him with indifferen|cy
only; but after &s;ome time they began
to be in earne&s;t. 'Tis true, they carry'd
on Matters with &s;o much circum&s;pection,
that nobody &s;u&s;pected any thing of the
matter, till after the return of the Dut|che&s;s
to <HI>London,</HI> when the thing took
vent; becau&s;e Mr. <HI>Howard,</HI> who had been
in Love with the Counte&s;s of <HI>S</HI>&mdash;
before he left <HI>England,</HI> now renew'd his
vi&s;its to her; which creating a Jealou&s;y
in the Dutche&s;s, broke all the mea&s;ures
<PB N="402" REF="263">
they had taken of keeping this matter pri|vate.
Mr. <HI>Howard,</HI> finding her enraged at
him, told her, it was in her power to &s;e|cure
his Heart for ever, by marrying him,
that he would remain faithful to her till
Death, and that &s;he &s;hould never fail of meet|ing
with all po&s;&s;ible tenderne&s;s and acknow|ledgments
in his Per&s;on. The Dutche&s;s
pau&s;ed a while upon a Propo&s;ition of &s;o
great a Moment; but at la&s;t &s;he con&s;ider'd
with her&s;elf, that the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Dutche&s;&s;e's
lo&s;e neither their Title, nor their Rank,
if they marry a private Per&s;on; and there|fore
judged, that being twice marry'd
by the choice of the Court, &s;he might the
third time di&s;po&s;e of her&s;elf to a gallant
Per&s;on whom &s;he liked; accordingly &s;he
po&s;itively engaged her&s;elf to Mr. <HI>Howard,</HI>
under Condition to keep their Marriage
undi&s;cover'd for &s;ome time. He being
&s;en&s;ible of the Sweets of &s;o advanta|geous
a Match, willingly promi&s;ed, and
in the mean time look'd out for a conve|nient
Hou&s;e where they might con&s;um|mate
the Marriage without noi&s;e or di|&s;turbance.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Porter</HI> had marry'd a Lady of
Quality, and &s;he was very hand&s;ome;
notwith&s;tanding which, they were parted,
and he lived with the Player in the
Country, endeavouring to ra&s;e out of his
Mind the Beauty of the Dutche&s;s of
<HI>Richmond;</HI> her ab&s;ence had afforded him
&s;ome re&s;pite, and his Rea&s;on told him,
it was next to an impo&s;&s;ibility to hope to
<PB N="403" REF="264">
plea&s;e a Lady, who always loved her&s;elf
&s;o well, as to be indifferent to others;
he had that comfort in his Afflictions, to
think, that all the re&s;t who loved her,
had been no more &s;ucce&s;sful than him&s;elf.
Whil&s;t he was di&s;tracting his Head with
the&s;e Thoughts one Night, word was &s;ent
him, that Mr. <HI>Howard</HI> was come to &s;peak
with him about Bu&s;ine&s;s of con&s;equence.
They being mo&s;t intimate Friends, he
&s;tay'd not one moment; but meeting him,
they embraced, as Friends u&s;ed to do,
who had not &s;een one another in two
Years. At la&s;t, Mr. <HI>Howard</HI> told him,
that he being ju&s;t now engaged in an af|fair
of the greate&s;t importance to him, he
thought he could pitch upon nobody el&s;e,
but upon him, to put his whole Fortune
into his hands; That he was upon the
point of marrying the hand&s;ome&s;t Lady
and of the be&s;t Quality in <HI>England;</HI> but
that &s;he being willing to marry in private,
he conjured him to lend him his Hou&s;e.
Mr. <HI>Porter,</HI> who was overjoy'd at the
confidence his Friend put in him, embra|ced
and told him, that all he was ma&s;ter
of was at his Service, without re&s;erve;
and he might di&s;po&s;e of it at his own
plea&s;ure; and to convince him of his &s;in|cerity,
that if he thought the Name of the
Lady ought to remain a my&s;tery to him,
he would not &s;o much as ask it. Mr. <HI>How|ard</HI>
reply'd, were it in an Affair that con|cern'd
me alone, I &s;hould not keep it from
your knowledge, but that his Mi&s;tre&s;s ha|ving
<PB N="404" REF="265">
laid her ab&s;olute Commands upon
him, he could not but obey her. Then
obey her, reply'd Mr. <HI>Porter,</HI> I &s;wear to
you I will keep with Mrs. <HI>L&mdash;g</HI> in
the mo&s;t remote Appartment of the Hou&s;e,
and your Nuptial Plea&s;ures &s;hall not
meet with the lea&s;t interruption here.
Mr. <HI>Howard</HI> hereupon takes his leave,
and returning &s;trait to the Dutche&s;s,
gives her an account of what he `had
done. I am very glad, &s;aid &s;he, you have
pitch'd upon Mr. <HI>Porter,</HI> he always
&s;hew'd a mo&s;t peculiar e&s;teem for me;
and therefore I would not have you make
our Marriage a Secret to him; he being
better qualify'd to know it, than any one
in the whole Court, and you may di&s;cover
the whole Matter to him.</P>
<P>The day appointed for this Journey be|ing
come, the Dutche&s;s and her Lover
departed without any noi&s;e; and coming
to their Friend's Hou&s;e, find him lock'd
up in his Chamber. Mr. <HI>Howard</HI> ask'd
for him, but was told he was not at home,
but that he might di&s;po&s;e of every thing
in the Hou&s;e at his own plea&s;ure.
Whil&s;t they were bu&s;ied in making the ne|ce&s;&s;ary
Preparations for the Nuptial Cere|monies,
a Fire broke out in one of the
Rooms, and burning into the Appartment
where the Dutche&s;s was, &s;he, full of
Fright and Confu&s;ion, runs up a pair of
back Stairs, and finding a door open, en|ters
the Room; which, proving to be
Mr. <HI>Porter</HI>'s Clo&s;et, &s;he found him bu&s;y
<PB N="405" REF="266">
in &s;earching among his Papers: He hap|pening
at the &s;ame time to light upon a
Picture in miniature of the Dutche&s;s of
<HI>Richmond,</HI> painted at length, dre&s;s'd in
Mens Apparel, as you &s;ee her painted at
<HI>Whitehall</HI> in &s;everal places, (becau&s;e &s;he
has a mo&s;t Maje&s;tick Air, and the fine&s;t
Leg in the World) left off rumi&s;hing a|mong
his Papers, in order to admire this
Picture, the &s;ight whereof made the
Wounds of his Heart, occa&s;ioned by the
Beauty of this Dutche&s;s, bleed afre&s;h.
Whil&s;t he was &s;ighing for her, he heard
a noi&s;e, and turning his Head that way,
found her ju&s;t entring the Door.</P>
<P>Never was any Per&s;on &s;urpriz'd with
more delight than he; he ran towards her,
&s;aluted her with a great deal of Re|&s;pect;
and ask'd her, What good Fortune
brought her thither? The preference,
&s;aid &s;he, I have given you before all our
Friends: I come along with Mr. <HI>Howard,</HI>
about the Bu&s;ine&s;s he &s;poke to you of be+fore.
That is as much as to &s;ay, Madam
reply'd Mr. <HI>Porter,</HI> you have had &s;$
good an opinion of my Di&s;cretion, as t$
engage for me to the Lady he is going t$
be married to; and I &s;uppo&s;e you are
come, by your Pre&s;ence, to add to the En|joyments
of the Fea&s;t. How! cry'd th$
Dutche&s;s, laughing aloud; Is it po&s;&s;ible
a Per&s;on of your Wit &s;hould not be|fore
this imagine it was my own Se|cret
I put into your hands? At the&s;e
Words, Mr. <HI>Porter</HI> looking &s;tedfa&s;t upon
<PB N="406" REF="267">
her for &s;ome time, without &s;peaking one
Word, his Strength and Sen&s;es left him,
and he fell in &s;o deep a Swoon, that the
Dutche&s;s thought he would never have
recovered him&s;elf. Being &s;trangely &s;ur|prized
at &s;o unexpected an Accident, &s;he
was going to cry out for help, when
he begg'd, to afford him a few mo|ments
audience. Accordingly, having ta|ken
a Seat near him, he look'd in her
Face for &s;ome time longer, without be|ing
able to find Words he thought &s;ui|table
to expre&s;s the violence of his Pa&s;|&s;ion.
The Dutche&s;s attributed his Silence
to his Weakne&s;s; for, knowing him a
Man of Wit, and who had the ea&s;ie&s;t
way in the world of expre&s;&s;ing his
Thoughts, &s;he judg'd that nothing could
puzle him upon that account. But Re|&s;pect
and Fear are the in&s;eparable Compa|nions
of Love; and the&s;e two are &s;ufficient
to make the bolde&s;t Man in the world
the greate&s;t Coward.</P>
<P><HI>At la&s;t, this Gentleman, overwhelm'd
with Grief and Vexation,</HI> Is it po&s;&s;ible,
Madam, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> you &s;hould pitch up|on
my Hou&s;e to be marry'd in, and that
the deare&s;t of all my Friends &s;hould be the
happy Man you like? And mu&s;t I be a
witne&s;s of your mutual Satisfaction, whil&s;t
I, condemn'd to &s;ilence for ever, mu&s;t con|tinue
to adore you, without the lea&s;t hopes?
Yes, Madam, yes, <HI>added he,</HI> I adore you
ever &s;ince that fatal Day, when the King
&s;ent me with Fire-Arms to fetch you out of

the little Garden at <HI>Whitehall.</HI> Your
Eyes gave me &s;ome irre&s;i&s;tible Wounds;
in&s;tead of wounding you, according to my
orders; I return'd with a Heart pier|ced
in a thou&s;and places. You were
then no more than a Child, a light wild
Butterfly; what rea&s;on was there to en|tertain
you with a Pa&s;&s;ion &s;o violent, as
made my Sufferings almo&s;t in&s;upportable? As
you increa&s;ed in Beauty, &s;o my Love grew
more violent: I paid you a thou&s;and Ho|mages
in private, I &s;ent forth a thou|&s;and
Sighs, but dur&s;t not di&s;cover them,
being quite &s;tartled at your Quality of be|ing
a Prince&s;s of the Blood. What would
become of me, &s;aid I, if the D. of <HI>Rich|mond,</HI>
or the King, being inform'd of my
Pa&s;&s;ion, &s;hould command the Dutche&s;s ne|ver
to look upon me? Or, what &s;hould I
do, if &s;he &s;hould receive me with Indigna|tion,
and puni&s;h my Temerity with Hatred?
I mu&s;t certainly langui&s;h to death under
this cruel De&s;tiny. At la&s;t, judging that
ab&s;ence might prove the only Remedy a|gain&s;t
my Pain, I marry'd, and carry'd my
Wife into the Country: But having no
great inclination for her, I proved contra|dictory
and oppo&s;ite to every thing &s;he liked;
&s;o that after having &s;pent &s;ome time to
render us both mi&s;erable, we parted. By
way of amu&s;ement I engaged with Mrs.
<HI>L&mdash;g,</HI> &s;he being of a &s;weet and pliable
Di&s;po&s;ition, I forbore &s;eeing you, Madam,
I never &s;poke of you; &s;o that if I was not
perfectly cured, yet my Di&s;temper was,
<PB N="408" REF="269">
however, much abated. Your Widow|hood,
your &s;tay in <HI>France,</HI> the Troubles
and Changes in this Kingdom; all the&s;e
things, I &s;ay, did take up my Thoughts.
Alas! what are you going to do here?
You are come to open afre&s;h my Wounds,
and to convince me that your Heart is not
in&s;en&s;ible of a Man of merits; that to gain
your good opinion, one need not court al|ways
the Quality of Duke of <HI>Lenox</HI> and
<HI>Richmond;</HI> and that, had I pur&s;u'd the
true Rules of Love, had I been more bold,
and had I, during &s;o long a time &s;ince,
devoted my&s;elf to you, di&s;cover'd my Sen|timents,
'tis po&s;&s;ible, out of Acknowledg|ment,
out of your Goodne&s;s, or perhaps
al&s;o moved by your Rea&s;on, or out of Ca|priciou&s;ne&s;s,
you might have done that for
me which you do for another. He has, 'tis
true, more Merit, but is not &s;uperior to
me either in E&s;tate or Birth, and does not
come near me in Love. See, Madam, &s;ee
here is the true cau&s;e of my De&s;pair, which
mu&s;t render me unfortunate all the days of
my life.</P>
<P>Know, Mr. <HI>Porter,</HI> &s;aid the Dutche&s;s
with a fierce Air, enough to &s;trike him
dead, that I reproach my&s;elf for ha|ving
&s;uffer'd you to &s;peak &s;o long; but
as the novelty of the thing &s;urpriz'd me,
&s;o it has made me altogether &s;ilent. I
leave you, and forbid you ever to &s;peak
to me again. With the&s;e Words, and
a mo&s;t di&s;dainful Look, &s;he flew out
of the Clo&s;et, leaving him under the mo&s;t
<PB N="409" REF="270">
cruel Torments that ever he felt in his
Life.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Howard</HI> had no &s;ooner perceiv'd
the Fire, but all his Care was to look after
the Dutche&s;s to allay her Fear. He run
into her Chamber, but not meeting with
her there, he call'd her by her Name,
but in vain; &s;o imagining &s;he was gone
down Stairs, he look'd for her in every
Corner, till at la&s;t he e&s;py'd her in the
Court; and coming nearer to her, found
immediately &s;ome Di&s;turbance in her
Countenance, which he attributed to her
Fright. I will leave the Hou&s;e, &s;aid &s;he,
this moment, and return to <HI>London.</HI> How,
Madam, cry'd he, will you go hence
without making me happy? Won't you
accompli&s;h what you were re&s;olv'd to do
for me? I will accompli&s;h it, &s;aid &s;he,
but never in this Hou&s;e, for I look upon
this Fire as ominous. Oh! Madam, re|ply'd
Mr. <HI>Howard,</HI> who knew nothing of
the matter, Fire is an Emblem of Joy and
Mirth; we are not to fight a Battel, nor
to take Towns, the whole is nothing but
a meer Accident. But the Dutche&s;s not
hearkning to his Rea&s;ons, they left the
Hou&s;e immediately to concert new Mea|&s;ure
for their Marriage.</P>
<P>No &s;ooner had the Dutche&s;s left Mr.
<HI>Porter</HI> in his Clo&s;et, but running from
one Extream to another, from his Lan|gui&s;hing
to the mo&s;t furious Pa&s;&s;ion that
can be imagined, he look'd upon Mr.
<HI>Howard</HI> no more as his intimate Friend,
<PB N="410" REF="271">
but as his Rival, who was going to rob
him of what he thought he had right
to challenge for him&s;elf. During the&s;e
fir&s;t furious motions, he thought of no
le&s;s than how to &s;atisfy his Revenge, to
puni&s;h the Dutche&s;s for her &s;cornful
Looks, and to kill both him&s;elf and her
Lover before her face. With this inten|tion
he aro&s;e in order to find him out:
But then con&s;idering that &s;o barbarous and
violent a Proceeding would be exclaim'd
again&s;t by all the World, and that accor|ding
to all the Rules of Decency, he
could not a&s;&s;ault a Man who had put
him&s;elf into his hands; the con&s;ideration
of his Honour was more prevailing than
his Anger, and &s;o for a moment re&s;olv'd
to &s;u&s;pend the execution. But &s;o &s;oon as
he reflected again, that the Marriage was
going to be con&s;ummated, Jealou&s;y re|po&s;&s;e&s;s'd
his Heart, he left his Room
with a full re&s;olution to &s;tab, in a thou&s;and
places, a Per&s;on, in who&s;e defence, upon
any other occa&s;ion, he would have &s;acri|fic'd
his Life. Mo&s;t &s;urprizing effects of
Love! This Pa&s;&s;ion reigns with &s;o uncon|trolable
a Power over our Hearts, that no|thing
is left us to appea&s;e it; and we &s;ee
the greate&s;t Hero's betray their Frailty in
this kind, no le&s;s than the meane&s;t Pea|&s;ant.
He was moving forward with the
greate&s;t precipitation, when meeting with
his Mi&s;tre&s;s, &s;he told him, the Dutche&s;s
and Mr. <HI>Howard</HI> were gone. He &s;eem'd
to be &s;omewhat better &s;atisfy'd at their
<PB N="411" REF="272">
departure. And now beginning to reflect
more &s;eriou&s;ly upon what he had de&s;ign'd
to do, and calling all the remaining
&s;trength of his Rea&s;on to his aid, he took
a re&s;olution not to appear again at Court,
till he were entirely rid of his Love.</P>
<P>He continu'd in this voluntary Exile for
&s;everal Years, till he was forced to come
to <HI>London</HI> on account of his Daughter,
nam'd <HI>Olympia,</HI> who being very young and
hand&s;om, and educated there, had made
a Conque&s;t of the Heart of my Lord&mdash;,
who&s;e Birth, Merits, Wit and E&s;tate was
&s;uch, as made him be look'd upon as one
of the chiefe&s;t Men at Court; for an Affair
of this nature. This is the &s;ame who in
1667; being engag'd in a Quarrel at the
Play-Hou&s;e at <HI>Paris</HI> with &s;ome Officers
of the King's Guards, they fell upon him
&s;everal at a time; &s;o that tho' he fought
like a Lion, they run him through in di|vers
places, and left him for dead upon
the &s;pot. The King being re&s;olv'd to
make them a &s;evere example of his Ju|&s;tice,
my Lord no &s;ooner under&s;tood it,
but neglecting the care of his own Life,
to pre&s;erve his Enemies, caus'd him&s;elf
to be carried to <HI>Ver&s;ailles</HI> to intercede for
them: which he did &s;o effectually and
generou&s;ly, that he obtain'd their Pardon
from the King.</P>
<P><HI>Olympia</HI> lov'd him as tenderly as her own
Life, and &s;he was no le&s;s belov'd by him.
But Mr. <HI>Porter,</HI> vex'd to the Soul at this
Intreague, without much pondering upon
<PB N="412" REF="273">
the matter, re&s;olv'd to break off a Corre|&s;pondency,
wherein his own Honour and
his Daughter's Reputation was &s;o nearly
concern'd. With this Re&s;olution he
comes to <HI>London,</HI> and being one day in
<HI>Hide-Park,</HI> the fir&s;t thing he ca&s;ts his
Eyes upon, happen'd to be <HI>Olympia,</HI> in
her Lover's Coach. His Anger being rais'd
to the highe&s;t pitch at &s;o unexpected an
Accident, he leaps out of his own Coach,
and running with Sword in hand to that
wherein &s;he was, would have kill'd her
without mercy, had not the Coach-Man
drove away at full &s;peed, and &s;o &s;aved
her Life. The Earl of&mdash;being in|form'd
of this Adventure, and dreading
the effects of &s;o violent and furious a Re|&s;entment
might fall upon my Lord&mdash;,
he found out <HI>Olympia,</HI> who being &s;till
under dreadful apprehen&s;ions of her
Father's Anger, the Earl promi&s;ed her a
con&s;iderable annual Pen&s;ion if &s;he would
break off all farther Commerce with his
Son; and repre&s;enting to her the Danger
unto which they mu&s;t expo&s;e them&s;elves
if they continu'd to &s;ee one another, &s;he
re&s;olved to go privately into <HI>France,</HI> where
&s;he was honourably maintain'd by the
Earl, pur&s;uant to his Promi&s;e.</P>
<P>I will not in&s;i&s;t, at pre&s;ent, to give you
an account of what Troubles her ab&s;ence
cau&s;ed to my Lord; he being a Per&s;on
very well qualify'd for a Lover; the lo&s;s
of one Mi&s;tre&s;s was &s;oon repair'd by an|other,
who co&s;t him as dear as this.
<PB N="413" REF="274">
As to Mr. <HI>Porter,</HI> he always lodg'd at
Dr. <HI>F&mdash;r</HI> when he came to <HI>London;</HI>
who had been for a con&s;iderable time the
Dutche&s;s of <HI>Richmond</HI>'s Phy&s;ician. It
happened one night that Mr. <HI>Howard</HI> be|ing
&s;eized with an Apoplexy, which put
his Lady and the whole Hou&s;e into no
&s;mall Confu&s;ion, they &s;ent Servant after
Servant to fetch the Doctor. But the
Dutche&s;s, impatient of all delay, and hur|ried
on with Grief, lays hold of a Flam|beaux,
without making the lea&s;t re|flexion
upon what the World might &s;ay
of her being &s;een in the Streets. She run
&s;trait to the Doctor's Hou&s;e, covered on|ly
with a loo&s;e Night-Gown, in Slippers,
and without Stockings. Her Servants, that
were &s;ent before, having already got the
Doctor's Door to be open'd, and the
Dutche&s;s entring the Hou&s;e without
knocking run, during this Con&s;ternation,
to the fir&s;t Chamber, where &s;he found a
Key. Mr. <HI>Porter</HI> being awaken'd at the
noi&s;e, opens his Curtains; but never was
a Man more &s;urpriz'd than he, to &s;ee the
Dutche&s;s almo&s;t naked, coming into his
Chamber at that time of the Night; and
when he &s;uppos'd &s;he but little thought
of him. It run in his head &s;he was
Dead, and came to communicate &s;ome|thing
to him. If, &s;aid he to him&s;elf,
our Souls have a perfect knowledge of
what pa&s;&s;es after their &s;eparation from
our Bodies, &s;he has di&s;cover'd the very
bottom of my Heart, and traced the in|delible
<PB N="414" REF="275">
Characters &s;he her&s;elf has engra|ven
there, and &s;he has pitch'd upon me,
before all the re&s;t that loved her, as him
who loved her mo&s;t. But be&s;ides, that he
had but a &s;lender faith in Spirit, he cou'd
not conceive how the Dutche&s;s cou'd ap|pear
&s;o hand&s;ome after &s;he was Dead.
He &s;aw the &s;prightline&s;s of her Eyes, the
lu&s;tre of her Complexion, her fair Hair,
&s;ome Locks whereof hung out under her
Night-cloaths, her maje&s;tick Air, and her
own Voice; which at once reach'd his
Ears and his Heart: All the&s;e were &s;uch
lively Circum&s;tances, as had no relation
to a dead Per&s;on. He &s;tood amazed,
without &s;aying one word, when &s;he came
flying into his Arms. Oh! Doctor, &s;aid
&s;he, is it po&s;&s;ible you &s;hould be a&s;leep
when poor Mr. <HI>Howard</HI> is at his la&s;t ga&s;p?
Come, in God's name, go along with me,
let's not lo&s;e one moment. Mr. <HI>Porter,</HI>
gra&s;ping her in his Arms; O cruel and
barbarous Dutche&s;s, &s;aid he, you whom
Fortune has deliver'd into my hands to
revenge my&s;elf of your Di&s;dain, don't
think I will let &s;lip &s;o favourable an op|portunity.
When &s;he found it was Mr. <HI>Por|ter;</HI>
&s;he &s;tood like one in a Trance; how|ever,
&s;oon recovering her&s;elf, with a &s;ingu|lar
pre&s;ence of Mind, told him, What
will you go about to di&s;oblige me, and be
beholden to &s;o violent an Action for what
you may expect from your own Merits?
I am &s;en&s;ibly affected with your Con&s;tan|cy,
and your Re&s;pect will compleat the
<PB N="415" REF="276">
conque&s;t of my Heart. You &s;ee whether
my Duty calls me, my Spou&s;e is a dying,
don't detain me any longer, and believe
that this proof of your Re&s;pect will
make a more &s;en&s;ible impre&s;&s;ion upon me
than if you put a Crown on my Head:
But if you are able to forget what you
owe to me, I &s;hall turn furious, and cry
out with &s;uch violence, as will &s;oon draw
tho&s;e to my a&s;&s;i&s;tance, that will be able
to &s;natch me out of your Hands. Mr. <HI>Por|ter</HI>
was divided betwixt Fear and Hope,
not knowing what re&s;olution be&s;t to take;
he que&s;tioned not, but if he let the Dut|che&s;s
go, he &s;hould &s;carce meet with the
&s;ame opportunity again; but he dreaded
the Noi&s;e, and much more her Anger. So
he told her, that tho' he was &s;ure &s;he
would prove ungrateful, he wou'd prefer
all the&s;e Hard&s;hips before the Favours
he might obtain again&s;t her Will. The
Dutche&s;s taking him in the humour, goes
out of his Room, and meeting the Doctor
as he was coming out of his own Cham|ber,
de&s;ired him to make ha&s;te to her
Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>She was no &s;ooner got out of Mr. <HI>Por|ter</HI>'s
&s;ight, but he began to repent of his
Obedience; What cou'd make me to act
in &s;uch a manner? cry'd he, &s;he is gone,
a barbarous Woman, as &s;he is, and now
laughs in the face of the whole World at
my Submi&s;&s;ion. It now comes to pa&s;s,
what I fore&s;aw before, the Dutche&s;s will
tell it to Madam of <HI>B</HI>&mdash;, and &s;he to
<PB N="416" REF="277">
another. <HI>Porter</HI>'s Pa&s;&s;ion will be the &s;ub|ject
of the Di&s;cour&s;e of the whole Court,
and every one will divert him&s;elf with it,
according to his own Humour. Being al|mo&s;t
reduced to De&s;pair, he under&s;tood
that the Dutche&s;s, with &s;ome other Ladies,
were to go to <HI>Wind&s;or.</HI> Thither he went al|&s;o,
with a re&s;olution of reproaching her
with the inju&s;tice he thought he had recei|ved
at her hands. But how great is the
Power and Charms of fair Eyes! She had
no &s;ooner turn'd hers towards him, with
&s;omething a more plea&s;ant Air than &s;he
commonly u&s;ed to do, but he thought
him&s;elf &s;ufficiently happy; and renoun|cing
his Country Retirement, and appears
as great a Courtier as ever. In the mean
while, the Dutche&s;s jeers him without in|termi&s;&s;ion.
He &s;ays, he is come out of
Spite, but I believe his Hatred is nothing
el&s;e but Love; and that, notwith&s;tanding
all his Prote&s;tations upon that head, he
&s;till loves her.</P>
<P>And I, &s;aid the Duke of <HI>Buckingham,</HI>
believe he does not. But to tell you the
truth, are you not a&s;ham'd to have given
us &s;uch a prolix Hi&s;tory of what you
might have told us in a few Words? You
have &s;pent above half an hour in talking,
and tho' what you &s;aid was very good,
yet I thought you might have been a lit|tle
&s;horter. You might have &s;ilenced me
when you were tired of it, &s;aid the
Earl of S. <HI>Albans,</HI> in a grave tone; and
when I &s;peak before you another time, I
<PB N="417" REF="278">
will be &s;ure to remember the Le&s;&s;on you
have given me to day. You take me
wrong, &s;aid the Duke, interrupting him,
and it &s;eems as if you did not apprehend:
I only intended to je&s;t with you. To pu|ni&s;h
you, I will continue my former Di&s;|cour&s;e,
but I &s;wear to you I don't know
where I left off, or where I am, unle&s;s
you help me a little into the way again.
You were upon the point of going with the
Dutche&s;s of <HI>Buckingham</HI> and <HI>Donna Maria
de Balboza</HI> to <HI>Sion-hill,</HI> &s;aid the Earl
of <HI>A&mdash;n,</HI> &s;o that you may begin with
this Journey. 'Tis true, &s;aid I, I manag'd
the matter &s;o dexterou&s;ly, that my Spou&s;e
was very glad I &s;hould have the honour
of this Fea&s;t, being well plea&s;ed to be rid
of the charge: For tho' I give her a year|ly
Allowance for Cloaths and other nece&s;|&s;ary
Expences, enough to maintain a Prin|ce&s;s
of the Blood, &s;he is always very rea|dy
to put any thing of that nature upon
me. A Man that has &s;uch a yearly Re|venue
as you have, &s;aid the E. of S. <HI>Albans,</HI>
may well afford it, and it would be ridi|culous
for you, who are one of the chief|e&s;t
Men in <HI>England,</HI> to &s;ee your Spou&s;e
appear without a &s;uitable Magnificence at
Court.</P>
<P>It &s;eem'd to me, &s;aid the Duke, that
our going to <HI>Sion-hill</HI> would prove more
plea&s;ant by Water than by Land; &s;o I
took care to have our Barges adorn'd with
rich Furniture, the Watermen that row'd
us being dre&s;s'd in the Habits of <HI>Moors,
<PB N="418" REF="279">
Indians, Turks, Pea&s;ants, Slaves</HI> and <HI>Sa|vages,</HI>
for the better Diver&s;ion of the
Company. On both &s;ides of our B$$ges
we were attended with &s;maller Boats,
painted and gil$ full of Shepherds and
Shepherde&s;&s;es, who &s;ung to us certain
Country Tunes, whil&s;t the Syrens and
Nymphs, placed in &s;ome other Boats,
play'd upon their Flutes and Hautb$ys.
All the Boats were &s;trew'd with Flowers;
and the Weather was &s;o fair, as proved
extreamly delightful. The young <HI>Balboza</HI>
had never been at any Entertainment that
promis'd better in its beginning. Whil&s;t
we were upon the <HI>Thames,</HI> I talk'd to her
as often as I had an opportunity. I ob|&s;erv'd
her to blu&s;h when &s;he return'd me
an An&s;wer, and to ca&s;t down her Eyes as
often as mine were fix'd upon hers; but
when &s;he &s;aw me engag'd another way,
&s;he turn'd her Eyes upon me. At our
landing place we were met by divers Cha|riots,
order'd for that purpo&s;e; each of
which holding no more than two Per&s;ons
at a time, the Ladies were for keeping
together; but this being oppo&s;ed by us,
every Gentleman took a Lady, and I ma|nag'd
the matter &s;o, that <HI>Balboza</HI> fell to
my &s;hare. It being not above two Miles
from the River &s;ide to <HI>Sion hill,</HI> all what
I could do to &s;pin out the Time, was to
order them to drive &s;lowly; and for fear
notice might be taken of it if I did &s;o a|lone,
all the re&s;t did the like, attended by
the Flutes and Violins.</P>
<P><PB N="419" REF="280">
But you will perhaps be &s;urpriz'd when
I tell you, that I was &s;o far $$$pifi$d with
Fear, that I dur&s;t not improve th$&s;e fa|vourable
Moments to make my Addre&s;&s;es
to the fair <HI>Portugueze.</HI> She did not di&s;|clo&s;e
her Thoughts to me upon that head.
For, as in her native Coun$$y they meet
but &s;eldom with &s;uch like Opportunities,
&s;o they &s;carce ever let them &s;lip; and &s;he
was at a &s;t$$d unto what cau&s;e to attri|bute
this Silence, which was often inter|rupted
by my Eyes. You are very pen|&s;ive,
my Lord, &s;aid &s;he, with a kind of
melancholy Air; without doubt your
Thoughts are taken up with Affairs of
great moment the King has thought fit
to intru&s;t you with. Whil&s;t a Man, &s;aid
I, is with you, he can &s;carce think of
State Affairs. I have, Madam, &s;uch
things to manage as concern me much
nearer, but am afraid of di&s;plea&s;ing you.
<HI>Balboza</HI> gave me no an&s;wer; but changing
the Di&s;cour&s;e, began to touch upon the
fairne&s;s of the Weather, and &s;ome other
indifferent Matters. I was &s;urpriz'd to
&s;ee her &s;o indifferent after having her&s;elf
given the fir&s;t occa&s;ion of declaring my
Love. By this time we came to the place
where our Fea&s;t was prepar'd; which I
can a&s;&s;ure you was &s;o well contriv'd, that
there has &s;carce been an Entertainment for
a long time which &s;urpa&s;s'd this, either
in Gallantry or good Attendance.</P>
<P><PB N="420" REF="281">
<HI>Balboza,</HI> who very well perceiv'd it
was made for her &s;ake, being affected
with a &s;ecret Satisfaction, could not for|bear
to di&s;cover it &s;ometimes. I walk'd
for a con&s;iderable time with her in the
Wood; where, being become more bold
by our Solitude, I began to urge her to
permit me to offer all my Vows and Ser|vices
to her. I am ignorant, &s;aid &s;he,
whether it is a receiv'd cu&s;tom here, as it is
in my Country, for the Court Ladies to have
their publick Lovers, whether they are
married or not, who perform a thou&s;and
Gallantries in their behalf, and that in the
face of the whole Court, without the
lea&s;t blemi&s;h to their Reputation; if this
is the Mode here, I am very willing to
accept you for my Gallant, and am over|joy'd
to &s;ee &s;o de&s;erving a Per&s;on, and of
&s;o high a Rank in the World, to devote his
Services to me. I'll tell you, Madam, reply'd
I, we are &s;omething nicer here than the
<HI>Portugueze,</HI> and we making the chief
Plea&s;ure of our Pa&s;&s;ions to con&s;i&s;t in Se|crecy,
'tis &s;ufficient for us to let our Mi|&s;tre&s;&s;es
be acquainted with our Sentiments,
without communicating them to the
whole Court. If you will give me leave
to love you, you &s;hall be my only Confi|dent,
and you &s;hall not have the lea&s;t rea|&s;on
to be di&s;&s;atisfy'd with my Conduct.
She an&s;wer'd me not one Word, but fetch|ing
&s;everal deep Sighs, continu'd &s;ilent for
a long time. At la&s;t, &s;aid I, Oh, Ma|dam,
what means this Silence! what
<PB N="421" REF="282">
the&s;e Sighs! Are you in love at <HI>Lisbon,</HI>
or in <HI>London?</HI> I have read a &s;mall No|vel
you be&s;tow'd upon the Duke of <HI>Mon|mouth,</HI>
I have read certain things there
which would perhaps have &s;carce been
ob&s;erv'd by one le&s;s intere&s;ted than
my&s;elf. I am not ignorant that your
Charms have gain'd you more than one
Adorer in our Court. I mu&s;t intreat you
to &s;peak &s;incerely, to let me know my
De&s;tiny. You are too urging, &s;aid &s;he, I
&s;carce know you very well, and you would
have me di&s;clo&s;e my mo&s;t &s;ecret Thoughts
to you. I am a Man of Honour, reply'd
I, and as I know I can keep any Secret
of yours, &s;o I conjure you not to delay
any longer to lay open your whole Heart
to me. But, &s;aid &s;he, won't you be &s;ur|priz'd
if you &s;hould find your&s;elf there
already better placed than you imagine?
Oh, Madam, &s;aid I, throwing my&s;elf at
her feet, don't flatter me with a Happine&s;s
unle&s;s it be a real one: Let me know,
without delay, what I have to hope or
to fear; deal &s;incerely with a Per&s;on
who will never fail to repay you with
tenderne&s;s and acknowledgment. What
would you know, reply'd &s;he with an
obliging Air? I find I mu&s;t tell you. Tell
me then, &s;aid I, whether there has been
as yet a Man in the World whom you
liked? Yes, reply'd &s;he. And, conti|nu'd
I, is this happy Man in <HI>England?</HI>
No, &s;aid &s;he. Then own, &s;aid I, that it
is the &s;ame Per&s;on whom <HI>Camilla</HI> loved at
<PB N="422" REF="283">
<HI>Lucea.</HI> 'Tis true, reply'd &s;he. And you
are then, &s;aid I, the <HI>Camilla</HI> of the Novel
I &s;aw? I am &s;o, &s;aid &s;he. Oh, Madam,
cry'd I, you make me de&s;pair. And why?
return'd &s;he: Are not you &s;ufficiently de|&s;erving
to ruin the good Fortune of an
ab&s;ent Lover? What is my Rival's
Name? continued I. <HI>Don Alvare,</HI> &s;aid
&s;he. He is born of an illu&s;trious but poor
Family, and it is by rea&s;on of their &s;len|der
Fortune they are not much taken notice
of; and it is that that rai&s;ed my Father's
Anger again&s;t him, and which obliged
him to intercede with the Queen of <HI>Eng|land</HI>
to accept of me among her Ladies of
Honour. I return'd her many Thanks for
her Sincerity, and the hopes &s;he had gi|ven
me&punc; that in time my Services might
meet with a favourable reception; and I
a&s;&s;ure you, I made it my bu&s;ine&s;s in good
earne&s;t to &s;erve her.</P>
<P>The Counte&s;s of&mdash;did not dream
in the lea&s;t, that after having loved her
with &s;o much tenderne&s;s, I &s;hould be in
a condition to engage in another Pa&s;&s;ion.
Her capricious Humour &s;he look'd upon
as a refin'd piece of Courte&s;y, for which,
according to her $pinion, I &s;hould have
thought my&s;elf obliged to her. When
&s;he &s;ound me without the lea&s;t unea&s;ine&s;s,
and that I look'd upon her with indiffe|rency,
&s;he judged the be&s;t way to make
me return, was to choo&s;e &s;uch another
Lover as might appear a dangerous Rival
to me. But being obliged to carry on
<PB N="423" REF="284">
this new Intreague with the D. of <HI>Mon|mouth</HI>
(for it was he &s;he ca&s;t her Eyes
upon) with a great deal of &s;ecrecy, by
rea&s;on of her Husband, I heard nothing
of the matter. In the mean while, being
&s;o far prepo&s;&s;e&s;s'd with my young <HI>Bal|boza</HI>'s
Beauty that I could not at all
times controul my Pa&s;&s;ion, they began to
talk of it at Court, and the Counte&s;s
was the fir&s;t who made her Je&s;ts of it.
The Queen, as you know, being a Prin|ce&s;s
of the &s;tricte&s;t Vertue in the World,
did not fail to take <HI>Balboza</HI> to task, and
to repre&s;ent to her the danger that atten|ded
her &s;eeing me, and &s;uffering my
Court&s;hip. You are young and innocent,
&s;aid &s;he; you are hand&s;om and of good
Extraction; you may promi&s;e your&s;elf,
that if your Father thinks fi$ to &s;ee you
&s;ettl'd in <HI>England,</HI> you &s;hall have my
Protection, and marry &s;ome con&s;iderable
Per&s;on, provided your Conduct is &s;uch
as it ought to be: But if you are &s;o un|fortunate
as to love the D. of <HI>Buckingham,</HI>
unto what M$&s;eries won't you expo&s;e
your&s;elf? He being a married Man, you
mu&s;t needs lo&s;e your Reputation in the
World, I &s;hall de&s;pi&s;e you, $our Father
will h$$e you, and you will meet with
as many Misfortunes then as you may
h$pe for good Fortune now.</P>
<P>How weak are the&s;e Remou&s;trances,
when a Hear$ is prepo&s;&s;e&s;s$d with a grow|ing
Pa&s;&s;ion? The Queen might &s;ay what
&s;he pleas'd, and as often as &s;he talk'd to
<PB N="424" REF="285">
her, <HI>Balboza</HI> told me &s;he found her Ten|derne&s;s
for me increa&s;e mo&s;t &s;en&s;ibly;
I could have often pray'd the Queen
to torment her, becau&s;e it turn'd to my
infinite Satisfaction. The Earl of <HI>Argyle,</HI>
whom I made my Confident, &s;eeing me
thus wholy taken up with <HI>Balboza,</HI> would
&s;ometimes put me in mind, what Vexa|tion
I was likely to cau&s;e to the Queen.
But that came too late, the&s;e Reflexions
finding but little acce&s;s in my Heart and
Mind; &s;o that both her and my Conduct
were equally cen&s;ured by the Court Cri|ticks.</P>
<P>One day, having mi&s;s'd to &s;ee her,
&s;he writ to me, She had &s;omething of
moment to impart to me. I went to
&s;ee her, and &s;he told me with a de|jected
Countenance; I will not make
a Secret in which you are nearly con|cern'd
in my regard: Know, my Lord,
<HI>Don Alvare</HI> is in this Country. Never
was any body more &s;urprized nor more
put to a <HI>nonplus</HI> than I. He a&s;&s;ur'd me,
that having under&s;tood how my Father
had &s;ent me into <HI>England,</HI> he re&s;olv'd to
follow me thither; and, to defray the
Charges of his Voyage, and to appear
like him&s;elf at Court, he had &s;old all the
remainder of his E&s;tate. Judge you, con|tinu'd
&s;he, what a condition I was in?
<HI>Don Alvare</HI> &s;eem'd to me at <HI>London</HI> &s;o
far different from what he appear'd to be
at <HI>Lisbon,</HI> that I could &s;carce afford him
one Look. 'Tis you, &s;aid &s;he, 'tis you
<PB N="425" REF="286">
who is the cau&s;e of it. Oh, Madam, re|ply'd
I, don't repent of it, you don't
cultivate an ungrateful Soil, and I hope
you will never have the lea&s;t occa&s;ion of
relenting at your having given to me the
preference before <HI>Don Alvare.</HI> He be|gins
already, &s;aid &s;he, to be &s;en&s;ible of
the change of my Mind, by my deport|ment
towards him; he &s;eems to be
much concern'd thereat, and I am
much at a &s;tand how to manage Matters
with him: For, if I check him ab&s;olute|ly
in his Addre&s;&s;es, and he finds out
the rea&s;on, he may perhaps, moved
with De&s;pair, give notice thereof to
my Father; and if I engage him to &s;tay
here, judge what a trouble&s;om Guardian
he will prove to us, as if I had not enough
of the&s;e already, I begg'd her not to be
too much di&s;turb'd, and that I wou'd con|&s;ider
what was the be&s;t to be done upon
this occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>Coming to pay my Re&s;pects to the
King, I there &s;aw <HI>Don Alvare,</HI> who had
been pre&s;ented to his Maje&s;ty by the Queen.
Tho' I did not look upon him with a
very good Eye, yet I mu&s;t own he was
a hand&s;om Per&s;on; and you having &s;een
him your&s;elf, &s;aid I, to the Earl of St. <HI>Al|bans,</HI>
I will not enlarge my&s;elf upon his
goodly Mien and Wit, neither wou'd I
pur&s;ue the con&s;equence of this Adventure,
wherewith you are as well acquainted as
my&s;elf, but that the Earl of <HI>A&mdash;n</HI>
being then in <HI>Ireland,</HI> ought not to be
<PB N="426" REF="287">
kept out of the Secret. I acco&s;ted <HI>Don
Alvare,</HI> who told me, he had been travel|ling
for &s;ome Months, and our Court be|ing
one of the fine&s;t in <HI>E$rope,</HI> he cou'd
not forgo to &s;ee it, without reproaching
him&s;elf; and tho' he had been only two
Days here, he was &s;o extreamly taken
with it, that he intended his &s;tay &s;hould
be longer here than in all others to|gether.
You may ea&s;ily imagine the
an&s;wer I made was far different from
my Thoughts; but Strangers being regard|ed
in &s;ome mea&s;ure by me, as &s;acred, I
cou'd not think of giving any Offence
to a Per&s;on who made &s;o good an appea|rance,
and who being without Protection
in <HI>England,</HI> it pity'd me he &s;hould have
the misfortune to light in my way, and
that he &s;hou'd &s;ell his E&s;tate for an un|faithful
Mi&s;tre&s;s, who had taken an An|tipathy
again&s;t him.</P>
<P><HI>Balboza,</HI> who was of a quick Appre|hen&s;ion,
did not fail, the very next time
I &s;poke to her, to ask me, Whether I had
con&s;ider'd of a way to bring her out of this
<HI>Dilemma?</HI> I told her, I had thought of
it, but it wou'd be better to let it go on
for a few Days, that the thing might ap|pear
the more natural. Good God! crys
&s;he, methinks I cou'd wi&s;h you far enough:
Do you &s;o little dread the lo&s;s of my
Heart? You don't hate <HI>Don Alvare,</HI> nay
you have been &s;o imprudent, as to com|mend
him before my face. You are very
carele&s;s to maintain what ought to be &s;a|cred
<PB N="427" REF="288">
to you. Awakened by the&s;e Reproa|ches,
I told her, How will you charge me
with want of tender$e&s;s to your Per&s;on?
Is it po&s;&s;ible you &s;hou'd be &s;o little ac|quainted
with the real Sentiments of my
Heart, as to &s;u&s;pect it in this manner as
you do? 'Tis true, I am &s;atisfy'd you
will prove true to me, this is the effect of
that good opinion I have of you; and
&s;uppo&s;ing it were the con&s;equence al&s;o
of the opinion I have of my De&s;erts, you
wou'd not quarrel upon that &s;core. Wou'd
you have me be jealous of a Per&s;on whom
you &s;acrifice to me? Yes, I wou'd have
you be &s;o, cry'd the, and were you born
in <HI>Portugal,</HI> you wou'd not have &s;tay'd &s;o
long to be reproach'd upon that account
by me. You are too fall of Pre&s;umption,
<HI>My Lord,</HI> you think one can't change you
for another; but know, People are &s;ome|times
much deceiv'd. I was not a little
&s;tartled at the&s;e words. Do you intend to
ruin me, Madam, &s;aid I? Have I de&s;erved
&s;uch cruel Menaces at your hands? Since
<HI>Don Alvare</HI>'s Pre&s;ence is &s;o odious to you,
let me mea&s;ure Swords with him; per|haps
I may be &s;o fortunate as to deliver
you from it. God forbid, cry'd &s;he, your
Life is too dear to me to expo&s;e it thus
upon any account whatever; but let me
alone, I'll contrive a way to make him
depart. She &s;poke not one word more up|on
that Head.</P>
<P>A whole Month pa&s;s'd, during which,
&s;he was &s;o far from &s;hewing the lea&s;t cold|ne&s;s
<PB N="428" REF="289">
to <HI>Don Alvare,</HI> which might give
him the lea&s;t &s;u&s;picion of her &s;ini&s;ter in|tentions,
that on the contrary &s;he gave
him peculiar marks of her Friend&s;hip,
and he appear'd &s;o gay and brisk, that
&s;ometimes I cou'd not forbear to re|proach
<HI>Balboza,</HI> which &s;he only an&s;wered
with laughing, to ju&s;tifie her Proceedings.
There was at that time much talk at
Court of a certain <HI>India</HI> Ship very richly
laden, lately come into the <HI>Thames;</HI> eve|ry
one went to &s;ee it; and <HI>Balboza</HI> having
got an exact information of the time
when &s;he was to return to the <HI>In|dies,</HI>
&s;ends for the Captain when <HI>Don
Alvare</HI> was at her Lodgings. The Cap|tain
coming thither, &s;he di&s;cours'd him
in private, and bidding him to view
<HI>Don Alvara</HI> very well, &s;he told him,
he was a Slave of hers, but grown &s;o in|&s;olent,
that &s;he was not able to endure
him any longer; for he wou'd &s;it down
by her, and be as familiar with her, as if
&s;he had not redeem'd him from his Chains,
or as if it were not in her power to put
them on again at plea&s;ure. If you will
have him, I will di&s;po&s;e of him very
cheap; you may take him along with you,
and di&s;po&s;e of him as you think fit. But
<HI>England</HI> being a free Country, and that,
if you take him by force, he may make a
noi&s;e, I will &s;end him aboard your Ship,
and &s;o you may keep him. The Captain
being very well &s;atisfy'd with <HI>Balboza</HI>'s
Propo&s;ition, agreed with her for the Price,
<PB N="429" REF="290">
and &s;he promi&s;ed to bring him abroad the
next Day.</P>
<P>This done, &s;he told <HI>Don Alvare</HI> &s;he
intended to buy &s;ome <HI>Indian</HI> Goods, and
intended to take nobody along with her a|board
the Ship but him&s;elf and her waiting
Women. He being overjoy'd to go along
with her, they &s;et out from <HI>Whitehall;</HI>
and as they were going along, (as I am in|form'd
by one of her <HI>Portuguze</HI> Women)
&s;he care&s;s'd this poor unhappy Lover to
the highe&s;t degree. Ships of a great bulk
ride always at Anchor at &s;uch a di&s;tance
from the Shoar, that there is no coming
at them, but by the help of a Boat. As
they were ready to go into it, &s;he
cry'd &s;he was afraid of being &s;ick,
and much more of the Water, it being
&s;omewhat blu&s;tery Weather; and there|fore
de&s;ir'd <HI>Don Alvare</HI> to buy her what
&s;he wanted, offering to give him Money
for that u&s;e. But, poor Lover, tho' he
had &s;ufficient rea&s;on to &s;ave his Money,
being in a &s;trange Country, and without
any hopes of farther Supplies out of his
E&s;tate; yet was overjoy'd of having
met with this opportunity of making her
&s;ome very valuable Pre&s;ents. She having
&s;eated her&s;elf on an Eminency, with
her Women, not far from the Shoar,
cou'd from thence &s;ee all that pa&s;s'd in
the Ship. Scarce had <HI>Don Alvare</HI> got
one Foot on Ship-board, but they &s;ent back
the Boat which had carry'd him thither.
The Captain told him, at the &s;ame
<PB N="430" REF="291">
time, that he having bought him of
<HI>Balboza,</HI> he was now his Slave. You may
gue&s;s at his Surprize, and the Rage it
put him into. He prote&s;ted, in vain. <HI>Bal|boza</HI>
had no power over him; his Words
were &s;poken into the Air; &s;o that, reduc'd
to the utmo&s;t De&s;pair, he re&s;olv'd, with
Sword in hand, to &s;ell his Life at the
deare&s;t rate. But being overpower'd, they
clapt this mi&s;erable Wretch in Irons. <HI>Bal|boza</HI>
having $ed her Eyes with &s;o pitiful
a Spectacle, return'd to <HI>London;</HI> and
&s;ent me word &s;he de&s;ir'd to &s;peak with
me.</P>
<P>Having receiv'd the whole Account of
this Matter from her own Mouth, I &s;tood
amaz'd thereat, to &s;uch a degree, as to
want Words to expre&s;s my Sentiments.
How, thought I to my&s;elf, <HI>Balboza,</HI> can'&s;t
thou carry thy Aver&s;ion to &s;uch a pitch,
again&s;t a Per&s;on who was once &s;o dear
to thee, and who has committed no other
fault than to love thee faithfully, and
to follow thee! How! coud'&s;t thou &s;ell
an unhappy Lover, who &s;old all his
E&s;tate he had left in the World, to give
thee fre&s;h Proofs of his Pa&s;&s;ion, and that
without having given thee the lea&s;t occa|&s;ion
of Complaint; and after all this,
treat'&s;t him wor&s;e than if he were thy
mo&s;t cruel Enemy! <HI>Balboza</HI> was not a
little &s;urpriz'd at my Silence, and being
Mi&s;tre&s;s of a &s;ingular Penetration and vi|vacity
of Wit, &s;he &s;oon gue&s;s'd at the rea|&s;on
of my pre&s;ent Di&s;turbance. So that
<PB N="431" REF="292">
without giving me any farther lei&s;ure to
recover my&s;elf, or to return an An&s;wer,
&s;he &s;aid, O$! I &s;ee very well, your Ri|val
is dearer to you than your Mi&s;tre&s;s;
what I have done, ought to be to you a
convincing proof of the preference I give
you before <HI>Don Alvare;</HI> but this does lit|tle
affect you, who have Compa$$ion for
him, but want Acknowlegement for me.
Oh, Madam, cry'd I, Was there no other
way to be rid of him, but to &s;end him
to the <HI>Ind$es?</HI> How cou'd you prepare
&s;uch heavy Chains for a Per&s;on who was
yours already? Cou'd you put &s;uch heavy
Fetters on a Man who had &s;o little de&s;erv'd
it? and cou'd you &s;ee them without Com|pa&s;&s;ion?
Let his Fortune prove as it will,
he was a Man of Sen&s;e, and of good Ex|traction:
The&s;e Qualifications alone, if
you had had no other rea&s;ons, ought they
not to have been prevailing enough with
you, to put a &s;top to your de&s;ign? Why
wou'd not you ask my Advice, at the be|ginning
of an Affair, whereof you now tell
me the Con&s;equences?</P>
<P><HI>Balboza</HI> &s;aw very well that I made
mo&s;t &s;evere Reflexions upon her treacherous
Action. She was vex'd at the Heart to
find &s;o little Complai&s;ance in me, that in|&s;tead
of applauding, I blam$d her with &s;o
much freedom, &s;he was ready to die with
Spite and Anger; and in this humour,
told me a thou&s;and reflecting things; and
wou'd have gon on farther, had not a
&s;udden Swelling in her Throat &s;topt her
<PB N="432" REF="293">
Mouth. I left her as much di&s;&s;atisfy'd as
&s;he cou'd be for her life; and whil&s;t &s;he
was taking care of her Health, I for my
part, &s;ent immediately to fetch <HI>Don Al|vare</HI>
from aboard the <HI>India</HI> Ve&s;&s;el; but,
as ill fortune wou'd have it, they having
&s;et &s;ail before, my Endeavours for his Li|berty
prov'd fruitle&s;s. Whatever Pains I
took to conceal from <HI>Belboza</HI> the regret
I had of giving her &s;o har&s;h a Treatment,
I cou'd not &s;o far di&s;gui&s;e my &s;elf, but,
that &s;he very well perceiv'd the Matter.
On the other hand, the Counte&s;s, who
had a mind to &s;ee me once more wear
her Chains, never met me without pay|ing
to me &s;ome peculiar marks of her Re|&s;pect;
which hitherto I have return'd but
in an indifferent manner; tho', as my Pa&s;|&s;ion
for the fair <HI>Portuguze</HI> began to a|bate,
that which I felt for the Counte&s;s
gather'd new &s;trength. I was &s;trangely
puzl'd with different, violent and con|trary
Pa&s;&s;ions; Oblig'd to avoid a Per|&s;on
who had treated me ill, oblig'd to
court one who, according to her opinion,
had ventur'd every thing for me, in &s;end|ing
<HI>Don Alvare</HI> to the <HI>Indies,</HI> and that at
a juncture when I had not the &s;ame in|difference
for the fir&s;t, nor the &s;ame incli|nations
for the other, which I had hither|to
pre&s;crib'd my&s;elf as certain rules of
my Duty I can't expre&s;s my Sufferings
under this Perplexity, till I was deliver'd
from it by a certain Accident.</P>
<P><PB N="433" REF="294">
I told you before, that <HI>Balboza,</HI> when
&s;he &s;ent <HI>Alvare</HI> aboard the <HI>Indian</HI> Ship,
was attended only by two of her Women.
The&s;e highly compa&s;&s;ionated the fate of
<HI>Alvare;</HI> and tho' their Mi&s;tre&s;s enjoyn'd
them Secrecy, and they promi&s;ed it; yet
they kept it no longer than their good un|der&s;tanding
la&s;ted, which prov'd of no long
continuance. For <HI>Balboza</HI> happening to
fall out with them about &s;ome frivolous
Matter, they told all they knew. The
whole Matter being divulg'd at Court,
and the Queen e&s;pecially having taken
an exact account of it, (<HI>Alvare</HI> being a
<HI>Portugueze</HI>) &s;he was highly incen&s;ed a|gain&s;t
<HI>Balboza;</HI> and as her Conduct had
not been plea&s;ing to her upon &s;everal o|ther
accounts, &s;he wou'd not &s;uffer her to
continue any longer in her Service, and
without any previous notice given her,
(unle&s;s it were a few days before) &s;he
caus'd her to be embark'd aboard a Ve&s;&s;el
bound for <HI>Lisbon,</HI> to reconduct her to her
Father. But &s;he dreading his Anger, and
his Poi&s;on or Dagger, found means to get
out of the Ship, and returning to <HI>London</HI>
under another Name, marry'd &s;ome ob|&s;cure
Per&s;on, and remain'd unknown to
the Court for a con&s;iderable time after.
Such a parting as this wou'd have co&s;t me
very dear, if I had loved <HI>Balboza</HI> as well as
I cou'd have done, without her treacherous
Heart. For you are &s;en&s;ible, my Lord of
S. <HI>Albans,</HI> added I, &s;he was worthy of
being beloved, and that her whole De|portment
<PB N="434" REF="295">
was &s;o engaging, as to prove al|mo&s;t
irrefi&s;tible. But now I parted with
her without Tears, and began to bend all
my Thoughts upon ways and means how
to be reconciled to the Counte&s;s's Fa|vour.</P>
<P>The D. of <HI>Monmouth,</HI> with whom &s;he
was engaged in a &s;ecret Corre&s;pondence,
being tir'd with an Intreague he was oblig'd
to conceal, &s;oon threw off his Fetters after
they became heavy and trouble&s;om to him.
As &s;he, on the other hand, finding his In|con&s;tancy,
was very willing to afford me
all opportunities of ju&s;tifying my&s;elf. I
own'd, without he&s;itating in the Matter,
I had loved <HI>Balboza,</HI> but that it was
&s;he that had forced me &s;o to do; becau&s;e
I cou'd not, I thought, pitch upon a more
proper remedy to cure me of my Pa&s;&s;ion
for her; that if &s;he wou'd con&s;ider, without
prejudice, the ill Treatment I receiv'd at
<HI>Tunbridge</HI> from her, &s;he wou'd &s;oon be
convinc'd, that the&s;e were not the right
methods to keep a faithful Lover. She
reproach'd me in her turn with Haughti|ne&s;s,
and with having left her &s;o abrupt|ly
in the Wood. Whither I was in the
right or not, &s;aid &s;he, you ought to have
&s;hewn more Submi&s;&s;ion, and to have en|deavour'd
by your Complai&s;ance to con|vince
me of your Pa&s;&s;ion, which you had
&s;worn to me by &s;o many Oaths. I ask'd
her Pardon, and clear'd my&s;elf as to
what had been told her concerning my
<PB N="435" REF="296">
Pa&s;&s;ion for the Counte&s;s of <HI>Grimbergue;</HI>
and &s;he made &s;o many mo&s;t obliging Ex|cu&s;es,
as re&s;tor'd in our Hearts an entire
Harmony, to &s;uch a degree, that ever
&s;ince we have not had the lea&s;t mi&s;un|der&s;tanding
or rea&s;on of Complaint again&s;t
one another, till ye&s;terday; when, after
having u&s;ed all my Intere&s;t to pre|vent
her Husband from carrying her into
<HI>Holland,</HI> &s;he entertain'd me as coldly as
if &s;he had never &s;een me before. Whether
it be that &s;he is vex'd with her&s;elf for
having refus'd the King's offers; or whether
her Pa&s;&s;ion for the Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI> is
reviv'd; or whether my Lord <HI>R</HI>&mdash;
has found out the Secret of plea&s;ing her;
this I am certain of, that &s;he has given
me &s;ufficient rea&s;on of Complaint, and
that I &s;hall let &s;lip no opportunity of
revenging my&s;elf.</P>
<P>The Duke having left of &s;peaking, the
Earl of S. <HI>Albans</HI> looking hard at him;
Is it po&s;&s;ible, &s;aid he, you &s;hou'd be vex'd
at &s;uch Trifles? You don't know, as yet,
whether the Counte&s;s is in the wrong;
whither &s;he may not have undeniable
Rea&s;ons for what &s;he did, and you ought
not to condemn her ab&s;olutely, without
being heard. If I was in no wor&s;e Condi|tion,
cry'd the Earl of <HI>A&mdash;n,</HI> I &s;hou'd
think my&s;elf the happie&s;t of Men; but,
after what I have &s;een, there is no room
left to doubt of it. And what is it you
have &s;een, &s;aid the Earl of S. <HI>Albans?</HI>
Oh! continu'd he, perfidious Dealings
<PB N="436" REF="297">
without Example, want of Conduct and
Faith not to be parallel'd. To be &s;hort,
the Duke of <HI>Monmouth,</HI> in a Basket ty'd
to a Rope, let down out of the Window
of <HI>Emilia.</HI> How! has the con&s;tant <HI>Emilia</HI>
done you this good turn, &s;aid the Duke
of <HI>Buckingham</HI> &s;miling? I was &s;o unfor|tunate
as to be an Eye-witne&s;s of it, added
the Earl; now judge whether our ca&s;e
is equal? and whether I don't de&s;erve a
thou&s;and times more Compa&s;&s;ion than
you?</P>
<P>I am &s;orry for your Misfortune, re|ply'd
the Duke; but, dear Nephew, I
think you have your De&s;erts; you were
beloved by my Lady&mdash;, &s;he was a
Lady worth your care; you prov'd un|faithful
to her; you are repaid in your
own Coin. Oh! my Lord Duke, added
the Earl, with &s;omething of a peevi&s;h Coun|tenance,
you preach what you never pra|ctis'd
your&s;elf; I know you have left more
Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es without cau&s;e, than you have
lov'd with good rea&s;on. What will you
tell me, return'd the Duke, <HI>I have left
more without cau&s;e, than I have lov'd up|on
good rea&s;ons?</HI> It &s;eems to me, that if
I had no rea&s;on to love them, I had &s;uffi|cient
cau&s;e to part with them. Your Par|don,
Sir, continu'd the Earl, for you have
often engag'd your Heart to &s;uch Per&s;ons
as had not the lea&s;t preten&s;ion to &s;o glori|ous
a Conque&s;t; notwith&s;tanding which,
you per&s;uaded them of your Pa&s;&s;ion by a
thou&s;and Oaths, till they belived and
<PB N="437" REF="298">
loved you; but no &s;ooner had you made
&s;ure of their Hearts, but you withdrew
yours; then don't deny, but that you
lov'd without rea&s;on, and that you left
them without cau&s;e. Own to me, that
you wou'd not have been guilty of either,
had you been your own Ma&s;ter. What I
have to &s;ay in my own ju&s;tification, in re|gard
to my Lady&mdash;is, I had an un|common
Tenderne&s;s for her, which in&s;en&s;i|bly
wore off in &s;pite of all my Endeavours
to the contrary; it was beyond my power
to continue in the &s;ame degree of Re&s;pect
to her; and &s;he being not ignorant of the
di&s;po&s;ition of my Heart, became chagrin
and angry with me. Scarce had I got
clear of this Engagement, when I was
entangled in another; my Heart wou'd
turn Rebel in &s;pite of all my Rea&s;on.
The fatal <HI>Emilia</HI> reduc'd me by her
Charms to the mo&s;t mi&s;erable condition
that ever you &s;aw. You are &s;o amorous
and &s;o frail, &s;aid the Earl of S. <HI>Albans,</HI>
that I will lay odds, that if &s;he thinks it
worth her trouble, &s;he may &s;ee you wear
her Fetters again, and play the Tyrant
more than ever. No, cry'd the Earl, ta|king
his Hat, and &s;triking it upon the
Table, <HI>no, never whil&s;t I live.</HI></P>
<P>The Stroak happening to light upon a
wooden Ca&s;e, cover'd with a Carpet, (to
repre&s;ent a Tablet) it was broken all
to pieces, to the great regret of the
Earls of S. <HI>Albans</HI> and <HI>A&mdash;n,</HI> e&s;pecially
of the la&s;t, who had given the Stroak.
<PB N="438" REF="299">
But the Duke of <HI>Buckingham</HI> drawing
nearer, and meeting, enclo&s;ed within it,
the Portraiture of the Earl of&mdash;
done in Wax work, what chance has
brought this Piece into your hands, &s;aid
he? A very odd one, reply'd the Earl;
and were you not a declared Enemy to
<HI>Epi&s;odes,</HI> I wou'd relate it to you. And
don't you know, my Lord, &s;aid the Duke
&s;miling, that you &s;ometimes take things
in the wrong? Wou'd it not be very unfair
for you to rob your Friends of the liberty
of breaking a Je&s;t? And can you think my
Palate &s;o far out of ta&s;te, as not to reli&s;h
your Di&s;cour&s;e with Satisfaction? I am
&s;o ea&s;ily inclin'd to believe you, &s;aid the
Earl, that notwith&s;tanding all my Rea|&s;on
tells me I &s;hou'd not, yet I can't for|bear
it. But, without making any far|ther
Reflexions upon the Matter, I am
ready to relate to you all the Particulars
of a certain Intreague which you never
knew but in general, and which I was
better acquainted with than any other Per|&s;on
whatever, by rea&s;on of the mo&s;t &s;trict
Amity that was betwixt the Earl of&mdash;
and me; and &s;ince the Earl of <HI>A&mdash;n</HI>
was too young at that time to be truly
inform'd of this Adventure, I will give
it you in all its Circum&s;tances.</P>
<P>'Tis &s;ufficiently know that the Earl
of&mdash;is one of the hand&s;ome&s;t and
mo&s;t lovely Per&s;ons of our Court; being,
be&s;ides his high Quality, Ma&s;ter of a con|&s;iderarble
E&s;tate, and generous to an ex|ce&s;s;
<PB N="439" REF="300">
we were &s;uch intimate Friends,
and &s;o con&s;tantly together, that they
call'd us by the Names of <HI>Ca&s;tor</HI> and
<HI>Pollux,</HI> A certain noted Author, having
written a Tragedy, call'd <HI>Ibrahim,</HI> the
&s;ame was acted with great applau&s;e; a|mong
the re&s;t of the Actors, &s;he that
acted <HI>Roxelana</HI> did her Part &s;o exceeding|ly,
that the Earl of&mdash;and I were
charm'd at the &s;ight of it. I ob&s;erved
he always heightn'd the Prai&s;es I be&s;tow'd
upon this Actre&s;s, who was from that day
forward known by the Name of <HI>Roxelana.</HI>
And as &s;he was a Per&s;on &s;carce to be
match'd in Beauty and a goodly Mien,
he wonder'd at him&s;elf, how he could
look upon her all this while with indif|ferent
Eyes, and at that moment took a
re&s;olution to love her. The King being
then at the Play, he order'd <HI>Roxelana</HI> to
come to <HI>Whitehall</HI> to act her Part over
again there. The Earl of&mdash;was very
diligent to carry her the&s;e Orders, and at
the &s;ame time offer'd to bring her before
his Maje&s;ty. She accepted of his Coach,
and taking one of her Acquaintance along
with her, we went all four into the
Room where the King was to Sup. As
we were going along in the Coach, the
Earl was &s;o full of his Court&s;hip that he
continu'd talking without intermi&s;&s;ion.
For my part, I could &s;carce forbear laugh|ing
when I reflected upon the oddne&s;s of
this Pa&s;&s;ion; having &s;ufficient lei&s;ure &s;o
to do, becau&s;e <HI>Roxelana</HI>'s Friend was &s;o
<PB N="440" REF="301">
old and ugly, that I thought &s;ilence much
better than what I could expect from her
Conver&s;ation.</P>
<P><HI>Roxelana</HI> being dre&s;s'd with all the
Lu&s;tre of a Queen to gain the Hearts and
Prai&s;es of the Auditory, did &s;o graceful|ly
perform her Part before the King, that
every one was of opinion &s;he needed no
more appear upon the publick Stage.
The Earl of&mdash;having conducted her home,
ask'd leave to vi&s;it her &s;ometimes. She
told him &s;he &s;hould always have a great
Re&s;pect for him, but that a young Wo|man
in her Station could not receive the
Vi&s;its of a Per&s;on of his Quality without
making her&s;elf a Town talk. He told
her, that tho' he look'd upon&punc; it as his
greate&s;t Satisfaction to &s;ee her often, yet
would he do it with &s;o much re&s;erve,
that &s;he &s;hould not have the lea&s;t rea&s;on
of complaint again&s;t him. He came to
&s;ee me the next day, but &s;o much in love
with <HI>Roxelana,</HI> that he could not &s;peak
one Word but of her. I &s;aw he was ab|&s;olutely
&s;et, and I knew her Character &s;o
well by hear&s;ay, that I could ea&s;ily gue&s;s
what Game &s;he would be at. If you will
take my word for it, &s;aid I to him, don't
follow &s;o far as you do your Inclinations
for a young Woman who will be too hard
for you. Oh, reply'd he, what danger
can there be in it? If &s;he loves Pride,
&s;he &s;hall have what &s;he likes: Has &s;he a
mind to leave the Stage, I will make her
very happy, and be complai&s;ant to her
<PB N="441" REF="302">
to the highe&s;t degree. I have heard her
repre&s;ented, reply'd I, as a Per&s;on not fit
for love; her Head runs upon making her
Fortune, and that by Marriage. I know
&s;ome who have &s;ufficiently been manag'd
by her upon that point. The Earl fell a
laughing, and de&s;iring me to go to the
Play-Hou&s;e, I went along with him. Here he
made his Addre&s;&s;es to <HI>Roxelana,</HI> paid her
afterwards a Vi&s;it, and back'd the decla|ration
of his Love by a rich Pre&s;ent. She
refus'd it with an Air and maje&s;tick Look
becoming a Queen; and told him, That
had he known her right, he would not
have gone about to open the way to her
Heart by Pre&s;ents, the&s;e being things that
made no impre&s;&s;ion upon her. The Earl
an&s;wer'd her with a great deal of Re&s;pect
and Politene&s;s; tho' he was not a little
di&s;turb'd to find her to a&s;&s;ume &s;uch an Air
of Grandeur, as would in all likelihood
check the progre&s;s of his Love; for Wo|men
inclin'd to love are of a much ea&s;ier
acce&s;s than tho&s;e of a contrary di&s;po&s;i|tion.</P>
<P>He gave me an account of all that
pa&s;s'd. Will you believe now, &s;aid I,
that my meaning is very good? And if
you will take my Advice, you &s;hould
engage no farther with her. 'Tis too
late, cry'd he, my Pa&s;&s;ion is too great to
think of renouncing tho&s;e ravi&s;hing Plea|&s;ures
I propo&s;e to my&s;elf in enjoying her.
Perhaps I may meet with more Difficul|ties
than I &s;uppos'd I &s;hould when I fir&s;t
<PB N="442" REF="303">
began to love her; but Love and Con|&s;tancy
&s;urmount all. You &s;hould, reply'd
I, add al&s;o your De&s;erts and your good
Qualifications; no doubt but <HI>Roxelana</HI>
will take them into due Con&s;ideration, I
will engage for her. So we parted, and we
met not &s;o often as we u&s;ed to do; not that
our Friend&s;hip was grown cold, but he
was &s;o far infatuated with this young
Woman, that he could &s;carce be a mo|ment
without her; and my Bu&s;ine&s;s lying
another way, I &s;eldom had an opportu|nity
of &s;eeing him. One Evening he
came to &s;ee me with all the marks of a
di&s;tracted Per&s;on in his Countenance;
and &s;o in effect he was. He told me that
<HI>Roxelana</HI> kept him at a greater Di&s;tance
now than &s;he did the fir&s;t day he &s;aw her,
and that at that very moment &s;he had
po&s;itively declar'd to him, he mu&s;t not
&s;et one Foot more in her Hou&s;e, unle&s;s
he re&s;olv'd to marry her. Judge, added
he, unto what a <HI>nonplus</HI> &s;he has reduc'd
me. I love her like my own life, and
can't live without &s;eeing her; but the
Condition &s;he propo&s;es is &s;o hard, that I
will rather die than &s;ubmit to it. I con|$ure
you therefore to advi&s;e me what is
be&s;t to be done. This is a very puzling
$$&s;e, reply'd I; were I le&s;s tender of
your Honour, I would be for your marry|ing
her immediately. You are not in ear|ne&s;t,
&s;aid he. No certainly, continu'd I$
But what do you think of it your&s;elf? I
$old you already, added he; I would ra|ther
<PB N="443" REF="304">
run my&s;elf through with my own
Sword. I did all I could to make him
per&s;i&s;t in this re&s;olution, by putting him
in mind, what a fine thing it would be
to &s;ee <HI>Roxelana</HI> the &s;econd Counte&s;s of
<HI>England.</HI> Don't &s;peak any more of it,
&s;aid he, &s;he &s;hall never be that whil&s;t &s;he
lives.</P>
<P>I did not &s;ee him for a Week after,
till I happen'd to meet him in St. <HI>James</HI>'s
<HI>Park</HI> with two Per&s;ons that made but a
very ill Appearance. So &s;oon as he &s;aw
me, he left them, and came to me. Well,
my Lord, &s;aid I &s;miling, how do Mat|ters
go with your Intreague? I hope
they will do pretty well, an&s;wer'd he;
and to make you an ab&s;olute Confident of
my pre&s;ent Condition, I can't but di&s;clo&s;e
my whole De&s;ign to you. I have done,
continu'd he, for the&s;e three Months la&s;t
pa&s;t, all what is po&s;&s;ible to be done to
gain the Heart of <HI>Roxelana:</HI> All my Suf|ferings,
Care, Liberality, all is in vain;
her Humour being as haughty as that of
the <HI>Sultana</HI> her&s;elf, who&s;e Name &s;he
bears, will not permit her to grant me
the lea&s;t Favour. I intend not to take
the &s;ame mea&s;ures in this ca&s;e as I would
do with a Per&s;on of Quality; I intend to
&s;eize her this Evening as &s;he comes out
of the Play-Hou&s;e, and carry her into the
Country; when I have once got her at
my Seat, I know well enough how to
deal with her. The&s;e Men you &s;aw with
me are to put it in execution. I was &s;o
<PB N="444" REF="305">
&s;urpriz'd, that for &s;ome time I was not
able to &s;peak. Why are you &s;ilent, &s;aid
he? Don't you approve of it? I am too
much your Friend, an&s;wer'd I, to approve
of &s;o unju&s;t and violent an Action. One
ought not to expect more from a Mi&s;tre&s;s
than what &s;he is free to give&punc; Is it po&s;&s;i|ble
you &s;hould find a reli&s;h in &s;uch Fa|vours
as are &s;natch'd by con&s;traint? Be|lieve
me, a nice and tender Pa&s;&s;ion, as it
is attended by a thou&s;and Charms which
affect our Hearts and Sen&s;es; &s;o a bruti&s;h
and forced Love mu&s;t needs cau&s;e &s;uch
Remor&s;es in a Per&s;on of Honour, as will
not &s;uffer him to reli&s;h the Plea&s;ure he
hopes to enjoy. Is it po&s;&s;ible, reply'd the
Earl, interrupting me, you can think me
capable of repenting in this kind; this
&s;eems to have in it more of the Frailty of
a Woman, than of the Courage becoming
a Man. My bu&s;ine&s;s is to enjoy, and &s;o
&s;oon as I have done, I &s;hall never think
any more of this Actre&s;s. You are in the
wrong, &s;aid I, if you imagine to enjoy in
&s;pite of her you love: Force may make
you Ma&s;ter of her Body, but you will
never be the more happy if you can't be
&s;o over her Heart. Take my word for't,
my Lord, you had better have patience
for &s;ome time longer, you had better Sigh
and &s;hed Tears at her Feet, rather than
exa&s;perate her by an Action &s;o contrary
to what ought to be expected from a
Lover.</P>
<P><PB N="445" REF="306">
All the&s;e Rea&s;ons made at la&s;t &s;uch an
impre&s;&s;ion upon the Earl, that he a&s;&s;ur'd
me he would quit all Thoughts of pur&s;u|ing
this De&s;ign, that he would renew his
Vi&s;its and Addre&s;&s;es, praying me to vi&s;it
her al&s;o &s;ometimes, in order to do him
all the good Offices I could. I was wil|ling
to do it, it being my opinion, that
&s;ince he had &s;hewn &s;o much deference for
my Advice, I could do no le&s;s than &s;hew
him this piece of Complai&s;ance. I often
vi&s;ited her, and the better I knew her,
the more I was convinced of her Merits
and Wit, and that &s;he look'd not for a
Lover, tho' never &s;o de&s;erving, but for a
Husband. As this could not but augment
my E&s;teem for her, &s;o I pitied the Earl
of&mdash;</P>
<P>Eight Months pa&s;s'd, during which we
could not perceive the lea&s;t compliance in
<HI>Roxelana</HI>'s Temper, tho' &s;he appear'd ve|ry
merry, and nothing could be more a|greeable
than her Conver&s;ation. But when|ever
the Earl would give him&s;elf &s;ome
familiar Airs, &s;he told him, &s;he would &s;ee
him no more as long as &s;he liv'd, becau&s;e
&s;he was re&s;olv'd to keep her&s;elf always
within the &s;ame Bounds of Prudence and
Vertue, as &s;he had done hitherto, unle&s;s
he would re&s;olve to marry her. At la&s;t
he promis'd he would with a thou&s;and
Oaths, but begg'd her not to di&s;cover it
to me, becau&s;e I was ab&s;olutely again&s;t
the Match, and would thwart it as much
as ever I could. She engag'd not to &s;peak
<PB N="446" REF="307">
of it; but her Joy being &s;o exce&s;&s;ive that
&s;he was not able to contain it; &s;he cou'd
not forbear to tell me the rea&s;on, begging
of me, for God's &s;ake, not to &s;poil her
Fortune. Truly, &s;aid I, fair <HI>Roxelana,</HI>
the Earl of&mdash;is not very wi&s;e
to mi&s;tru&s;t me upon this occa&s;ion, I
being neither his Father nor his Guardian,
but only his Friend, have no power to
con&s;train him in &s;uch Matters as he judges
mo&s;t convenient for his purpo&s;e; and con|&s;equently
I may ea&s;ily hold my Tongue,
and remain an idle Spectator of what he
intends to do, without being blam'd for
it. Every thing being &s;ettl'd for the Con|&s;ummation
of the Match betwixt them,
without the privity of any body, except
&s;uch as mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity know it, he
propos'd &s;he &s;hould go along with him
into the Country. But, as if &s;he had had
&s;ome fore&s;ight of what afterwards hap|pen'd,
&s;he told him, &s;he would be mar|ry'd
in <HI>London.</HI> After &s;ome Conte&s;ts, he
con&s;ented to it, and marry'd her at his
own Hou&s;e. The Ceremony being over,
&s;he thought her&s;elf now at the highe&s;t
pitch of her Wi&s;hes. And never did any
Per&s;on &s;hew more Satisfaction at her good
Fortune than &s;he did.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Night was &s;carce pa&s;s'd,
when <HI>Roxelana</HI> being &s;till a&s;leep, the Earl
pu&s;h'd her very roughly; Awake, &s;aid he,
awake, <HI>Roxelana,</HI> 'tis time to be gone.
She turning her Eyes upon him, Why,
my Lord, &s;aid &s;he, do you call me <HI>Roxe|lana?</HI>
<PB N="447" REF="308">
Why mu&s;t I not have the Honour
of being Counte&s;s of&mdash;? No, reply'd
he, you are not &s;o, you are not marry'd
to me; and to unfold the whole My&s;tery,
know, That it was my Steward di&s;guis'd
who perform'd the Marriage Ceremony
betwixt us ye&s;terday. Oh! Traytor, cry'd
&s;he, taking hold of his Throat, and en|deavouring
in this fir&s;t Fury to &s;trangle
him, thou &s;halt die by my hands. The
Earl &s;eeing her thus furious, &s;ound means
to di&s;engage him&s;elf, and &s;o left the
Chamber. She got out of the Bed, and
laying hold of his Sword, which lay up|on
the Table, pur&s;u'd him to the very
Dining Room Door, which he &s;hut and
lock'd again&s;t her. Now <HI>Roxelana</HI> find|ing
her&s;elf bereav'd of the main Object
of her Fury, turn'd the Effects thereof
again&s;t her&s;elf. She tore her Hair and
Face, and made mo&s;t dreadful Outcries
and mo&s;t pitiful Lamentations, enough to
touch her Husband's Heart. But finding
him not to appear, &s;he re&s;olv'd to kill
her&s;elf; and turning the point of the na|ked
Sword again&s;t her Bo&s;om, thru&s;t is
into her Body with &s;uch a force as mu&s;t
needs have put an end to her Life, had
not her trembling Hand fail'd in &s;ome
mea&s;ure in the intended fatal Execution;
for the Sword pa&s;&s;ing along the Ribs,
gave her a Wound which prov'd rather
large than dangerous. She dropt, &s;wim|ming
in her own Blood: And the Earl,
who had &s;een all what pa&s;s'd from a
<PB N="448" REF="309">
place where he cou'd not ea&s;ily be &s;een;
now mov'd with Compa&s;&s;ion, &s;ent to me
to give her all po&s;&s;ible A&s;&s;i&s;tance. To|wards
Evening &s;he was carry'd to her own
Home, and I happen'd to come in at the
&s;ame moment, being impatient to hear
how Matters went, gue&s;s at my &s;urprize,
when I &s;aw her &s;upported half dead by
&s;everal Per&s;ons who put her to Bed. I
drew nearer, and &s;he no &s;ooner &s;aw me,
but, Oh! My Lord, cry'd &s;he, pray un|der&s;tand
from my own Mouth my Mi&s;|fortunes,
and the Perfidiou&s;ne&s;s of a Mon|&s;ter,
unworthy to &s;ee the Light of the
Sun. She then related to me, with Tears
and Sighs, all what had pa&s;s'd; which
cou'd not but move me to Compa&s;&s;ion.
Whil&s;t &s;he was talking to me with the
utmo&s;t vehemency, ca&s;ting her Eyes upon
a Pourtraiture of Wax-work of the Earl
of&mdash;, which he had pre&s;ented to
her not long before, &s;he was &s;o enrag'd at
the &s;ight thereof, that in &s;pite of her
Weakne&s;s, &s;he leapt out of Bed, with an
intention to da&s;h it to pieces. I had much
ado to prevent her; and for fear of &s;ome
new commotion of her Spirits, which might
have prov'd very dangerous, I order'd
my Servants to take the Ca&s;e with the
Pourtraiture, and carry it to my Hou&s;e.
This is the &s;ame you &s;ee, continu'd he,
looking upon the Duke of <HI>Buckingham</HI>
and the Earl of <HI>A&mdash;n.</HI> But, to end
this Story in a few words, <HI>Roxelana</HI> at|tempted
to make her Marriage &s;tand good
<PB N="449" REF="310">
in Law, but the power of the Earl carry'd
it above the poor Actre&s;s. However, he
was forced to allow her a Maintenance,
and to provide for a Son &s;he brought into
the World. Ever &s;ince this odd Adven|ture
we have not been &s;o intimate Friends
as we u&s;ed to be. He has own'd to me,
he thought fit to conceal from me that
ill Action he intended to put upon the
poor young Woman, judging I would be
again&s;t it, and that it might prove the
occa&s;ion of a Difference betwixt us.</P>
<P>I know almo&s;t every thing you have
related to be true, &s;aid the Duke of <HI>Buc|kingham,</HI>
and I can't but confe&s;s the Con|duct
of the Earl of&mdash;in this Affair
was very di&s;honourable, and I was always
one of tho&s;e that blam'd him mo&s;t for it.
As for me, &s;aid the Earl of <HI>A</HI>&mdash;<HI>n,</HI> I
commend him for it; why &s;hould he not
by one di&s;honourable act prevent another,
which he mu&s;t have expected from <HI>Roxe|lana?</HI>
And if we under&s;tood our&s;elves
rightly, we &s;hould deal thus with all
Womenkind. The Earl of S. <HI>Albans</HI> &s;mi|led,
and told him, that his Spite again&s;t
<HI>Emilia</HI> and the Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI> made
him launch out thus again&s;t the whole
fair Sex, and that it was but rea&s;onable
he &s;hould put &s;ome Bounds to his Re|&s;entment.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t they were yet bu&s;ie in talking,
in comes a <HI>Valet de Chambre</HI> of the Duke
of <HI>Buckingham</HI>'s and brings him a Billet,
which was deliver'd to him by <HI>E&s;ther,</HI>
<PB N="450" REF="311">
from the Counte&s;s of&mdash;At the re|ceit
thereof, the Duke changed his Coun|tenance:
He had a great mind to read it,
but his Haughtine&s;s would not let him;
for, after what he had told the&s;e two
Lords concerning his Mi&s;tre&s;s, he fear'd
they would ob&s;erve him, and divert them|&s;elves
at his co&s;t. The Earl of S. <HI>Albans</HI>
&s;hrewdly gue&s;&s;ing at the Matter: Believe
me for once, &s;aid he, don't &s;ide with your
Anger again&s;t the true Sentiments of your
Heart; mine foretells me, there's a Ju|&s;tification
in the ca&s;e. Would not you
be overjoy'd in ca&s;e the Counte&s;s &s;hould
offer &s;uch Mea&s;ures towards a Reconcile|ment
as you could wi&s;h for? I don't very
well know, as the ca&s;e ju&s;t now &s;tands, what
I could wi&s;h, &s;aid the Duke, with an Air that
di&s;cover'd more of Love than of Trouble;
but be it as it will, I have a mind to &s;ee
once more, what way this <HI>Ungrateful</HI>
will find to ju&s;tify the Reception &s;he
gave me. He found only the&s;e few Lines
written in the Billet.</P>
<P>Your Eyes &s;ufficiently di&s;cover'd your
Anger; why would not you at the &s;ame
time find out my Di&s;content? You know
part of what makes me complain of you,
but I have a mind to convince you of it,
by telling you what rea&s;on you have to
commend me. Don't fail to expect me at
your Hou&s;e this Evening, tho' it were a$
the peril of my Life.</P>
<P><PB N="451" REF="312">
Hah! &s;aid the Duke, I begin to breath
&s;omething ea&s;ier. I mu&s;t own it, to my
Shame, whatever Indifferency and Spite I
might pretend to, I loved &s;till at the bot|tom
of my Heart; and I was almo&s;t re|duced
to De&s;pair, to &s;ee my&s;elf obliged
to hate what was &s;o dear to me. How
happy are you, &s;aid the Earl of <HI>A</HI>&mdash;<HI>n?</HI>
You are in a condition to be beguil'd by
what you love. You are not &s;o well
u&s;ed, &s;aid the Earl of S. <HI>Albans.</HI> No,
added the Earl, I mu&s;t not have &s;een with
my own Eyes the Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI> let
down out of <HI>Emilia</HI>'s Window; is it po&s;|&s;ible
for a Man to dige&s;t &s;uch an unwor|thy
Contrivance? and did I not de&s;erve
to be u&s;ed at a very &s;curvy rate, if I &s;hould
di&s;pen&s;e with it? Good God! reply'd
my Lord of St. <HI>Albans,</HI> you argue but
very indifferently for your Repo&s;e; if
our Weakne&s;s is very great, we mu&s;t
controul our Rea&s;on, we mu&s;t &s;eek not to
know what we know, and conceal what
we &s;ee; we mu&s;t, &s;ay I, per&s;uade our|&s;elves
we are contented. Yes, cry'd the
Earl of <HI>A</HI>&mdash;<HI>n,</HI> &s;omewhat impatient,
yes, my Lord, that is to &s;ay, one mu&s;t
be a ridiculous Fool, a Sot, a Bubble;
&s;uffer one&s;elf to be kill'd, and to ki&s;s
the Hand that directs the Dagger to your
Heart. Your Maxims and mine, con|tinu'd
he, are very different; in&s;tead of
this complai&s;ant Air, which you would
infu&s;e into me, I &s;hall make u&s;e of ano|ther,
directly oppo&s;ite to yours: And
<PB N="452" REF="313">
&s;ince I know not how to make my&s;elf to
be belov'd, I will at lea&s;t make my&s;elf to
be fear'd.</P>
<P>Having utter'd the&s;e Words, he was
going to leave the Room; but the Duke
laugh'd &s;o loud, and cry'd out, <HI>Adieu,</HI>
good Sir, the Terror of the fair Sex, and
Bugbear of Husbands, that the Earl of
<HI>A</HI>&mdash;<HI>n,</HI> in &s;pite of all his Anger,
could not forbear laughing in his turn.
We parted very near at the &s;ame Mo|ment:
The Duke went to his Hou&s;e to
attend his Appointment; the Earl of
<HI>A</HI>&mdash;<HI>n,</HI> full of Melancholy, to his Re|tirement;
and the Earl of S. <HI>Albans</HI> to
Court.</P>
<P>The Duke of <HI>Monmouth,</HI> after having
quitted his Basket, came to my Lord <HI>Grey.</HI>
It being then after Supper, my Lord up|braided
him for making him &s;tay &s;o
long. If you knew, &s;aid the Duke,
what it was that detain'd me, you would
pity me in&s;tead of complaining. He
took him a&s;ide, and told him what
had happen'd. My Lord <HI>Grey</HI> not be|ing
able to forbear laughing at &s;everal
Pa&s;&s;ages he related to him, the Duke was
almo&s;t angry. Did ever a Man, &s;aid he,
laugh at the Misfortunes of his Friend?
To be pe&s;tred with three Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es at
once; and be&s;ides this, the fear I lay
under that the thing might come to the
King's ear; was not all this Vexation
enough? Were you not an uncon&s;tant
Wretch, an&s;wer'd my Lord <HI>Grey,</HI> you
<PB N="453" REF="314">
need not fear &s;uch like Adventures; but
you are always fluttering about like a
Butterfly. You do well, reply'd the Duke,
to upbraid me; were I not &s;o much out
of humour, I would not be long indebted
to you; but at this time I am not for
Diver&s;ions and Je&s;ts. The Duke con|tinu'd
his Di&s;cour&s;e, and every foot the
thought of the Basket returning into my
Lord <HI>Grey</HI>'s head, he laugh'd out aloud.
'Tis now no time to laugh, &s;aid the Duke,
but our bu&s;ine&s;s is to contrive means how
to appea&s;e Madam&mdash;, <HI>Emilia</HI> and <HI>Phi|ladelphia.</HI>
You have without doubt a hard
piece of Work to do, and more difficult
than you imagine, reply'd my Lord, but
nothing &s;hall be too hard a task for me
to &s;erve you. I will go and &s;ee <HI>Emilia;</HI>
I will al&s;o &s;peak to her Companion;
but as to Madam&mdash;, I leave you
to manage her. If you will undertake,
&s;aid the Duke, to &s;et Matters to rights
with the other two fair Ladies, I will go
to the third immediately. What, with|out
eating, &s;aid my Lord, pray &s;tay a lit|tle.
I can't, &s;aid the Duke, I will make
my Peace whil&s;t her Husband is ab&s;ent,
and then go to Supper. Coming to Ma|dam
&mdash;, he was told, &s;he was not
very well, and gone to Bed: He then
kneeling at her Bed &s;ide, and &s;queezing
her Hand betwixt his for a con&s;iderable
time, not knowing what to &s;ay; at la&s;t
ask'd her, how &s;he did? and whether no|thing
could be done to ea&s;e her? You
<PB N="454" REF="315">
can do all, my Lord, &s;aid &s;he, with a
langui&s;hing tone, which render'd her infi|nitely
lovely; you can do every thing for
my ea&s;e, if you plea&s;e. But what rea&s;on
have I to hope for any thing from a faith|le&s;s
Man, who loves me not? Madam,
reply'd he, I confe&s;s to you, that I have
already upbraided my&s;elf for having gi|ven
you &s;ome apparent occa&s;ion of Com|plaint;
but &s;ometimes things happen &s;o
unfore&s;een, that 'tis impo&s;&s;ible to avoid
them. Such a one was this Night's Ad|venture,
which is, que&s;tionle&s;s, what now
troubles you; and I &s;wear to you, never
was a Man more innocent.</P>
<P>I happen'd by chance to come into the
Room of the Ladies of her ..... when
<HI>Philadelphia</HI> was very ill, and <HI>Emilia</HI> did
a&s;&s;i&s;t her; tho' I have only a bare Indiffe|rency
for <HI>Emilia,</HI> I thought it unhand&s;om
to leave her. Scarce was &s;he recovered
out of her Swoon, when the Governe&s;s
coming, and the young Ladies dreading
her Anger, &s;hut me up in the Clo&s;et;
you coming in at the &s;ame time, and this
proving a new Matter of trouble, they
thought to deliver them&s;elves from it by
letting me down out of the Window. I
want a little more Faith, &s;aid Madam
&mdash;, and &s;omething of your Dexterity,
to be &s;atisfy'd of the truth of the Account
you give me. But, my Lord, is it not
too too true, that you are in love with
one of the&s;e Ladies? I retain &s;till fre&s;h
in memory, with what a tender and pa&s;&s;io|nate
<PB N="455" REF="316">
Air you u&s;ed to entertain <HI>Emilia:</HI>
'Tis in vain to tell me &s;he is indifferent
to you; I need only take a little pains to
be convinced of your Sentiments. You
will do much better, reply'd the Duke,
not to be in&s;tructed by any body but my
&s;elf; for if you &s;et a watch over me,
the&s;e jealous Proceedings will excite my
Heart to Rebellion. Believe me, 'tis on|ly
yours; and is not this &s;ufficient for
your Satisfaction? Madam&mdash;by
her Sighs and Silence gave him to under|&s;tand,
&s;he knew what &s;he had to do.
The Duke was vex'd thereat, it being his
cu&s;tom to be beforehand with his Mi|&s;tre&s;s
in Courte&s;ies, expecting they &s;hould
take his word for what he told them,
whether out of inclination or de&s;ign, and
to re&s;t &s;atisfied, without diving farther
into the matter. Madam&mdash;had not
Strength enough to an&s;wer him, being
much indi&s;po&s;ed, as I told you before,
and much vex'd at his Pre&s;ence. He per|ceiving
the matter, departed the Room;
and going home, pa&s;s'd the remainder of
the Night in contriving the be&s;t means he
could to redre&s;s his amorous Affairs,
which were then but in a very bad con|dition.</P>
<P>After having made his Appearance at
Court, the next day he retir'd into his
Clo&s;et, in expectation of my Lord <HI>Grey</HI>'s
coming, he having promis'd to bring him
his Mi&s;tre&s;s's An&s;wer. He came &s;oon af|ter,
and finding the Duke alone; Gue&s;s,
<PB N="456" REF="317">
&s;aid he, what I am going to tell you.
Truly, reply'd he, I am not able to gue&s;s.
<HI>Emilia</HI> is of too uneaven a Temper to tell
you what to make of her; and <HI>Philadel|phia</HI>
is &s;uch a piece of Formality, that I
know not what Character to give her. I
&s;poke to both, but to each in private,
&s;aid my Lord <HI>Grey,</HI> chance having offer'd
me an opportunity of &s;o doing. Neither
of them would declare them&s;elves frank|ly
upon the Matter; but was charged by
<HI>Emilia,</HI> that &s;he mu&s;t &s;peak to you her|&s;elf.
<HI>Philadelphia</HI> al&s;o told me, &s;he &s;hould
be well plea&s;ed to &s;ee you, but that being
watch'd and overlook'd in all Corners,
&s;he conjures you, if you have any re&s;pect
for her, to be upon your guard, and ra|ther
not to look at her in a Week's time,
than to rai&s;e a jealou&s;y in <HI>Emilia.</HI></P>
<P>The Duke a&s;&s;ur'd my Lord, he would
punctually ob&s;erve the Commands of his
two Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es. And, added he, do you
really believe them to be angry with me?
I could not, I tell you, dive into their
real Sentiments; but it &s;eem'd to me as
if <HI>Emilia</HI> was unea&s;ie and melancholy.
The rea&s;on is, becau&s;e I am not &s;o indif|ferent
to her as to her Companion, re|ply'd
the Duke, with an angry Counte|nance.
To &s;ee you &s;igh, &s;ays my Lord,
&s;eems as if you were troubled at it. The
Duke an&s;wer'd not one Word, till after
having pau&s;ed a while, he look'd upon
my Lord <HI>Grey;</HI> I confe&s;s to you, &s;aid he,
I never took any real delight in the po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion
<PB N="457" REF="318">
of a Heart whereof I thought my|&s;elf
ab&s;olutely &s;ure. And what is it,
&s;aid my Lord, that affects you mo&s;t, you
have a very good Reli&s;h? My greate&s;t
Delight is, continu'd the Duke, in pay|ing
my Services to a new Mi&s;tre&s;s, to
watch her Scorns, my Hopes, Fears, Un|ea&s;ine&s;s,
and, in &s;hort, every thing we
meet with at the beginning of an amo|rous
Pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>This is the &s;tate of the ca&s;e betwixt
<HI>Philadelphia</HI> and me. I am apt to believe
her Inclinations are for me; that &s;he
&s;trives again&s;t them; that there is a
great Conte&s;t betwixt Vertue, Rea&s;on,
and the Inclinations of her Heart, which
pleads for me; and that in &s;pite of her|&s;elf,
&s;he will love me at la&s;t. This 'tis
that I am ambitious of, this flatters my
Vanity.</P>
<P>Oh! my Lord, cry'd my Lord <HI>Grey,</HI>
I find you are as yet unacquainted with
the e&s;&s;ential part of Love; your Mind
runs only upon Trifles and Amu&s;ements.
If your Heart were truly inclin'd to
Tenderne&s;s, you would put all your Hap|pine&s;s
in being belov'd by the Object you
love. The very Thoughts whether you
were in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of your Mi&s;tre&s;s's
Heart or not, would drive you to De|&s;pair,
and whatever might thwart it,
would cau&s;e you a thou&s;and Inquie|tudes.
Now judge, by your own Senti|ments,
and by tho&s;e I have de&s;crib'd,
what prodigious difference there is be|twixt
<PB N="458" REF="319">
Fiction and Reality. I &s;wear to
you, &s;aid the Duke interupting him, at
that rate I know nothing but Fiction to
this moment; if it be true, that if a Man
will love well, he mu&s;t love in earne&s;t.
I &s;ee, &s;aid my Lord, you Hour is not come
yet; but time will come, when you will
tell me enough of it, and perhaps more
than you wi&s;h for. He went away, af|ter
having &s;poken this Prophecy, which
was &s;ufficiently verify'd in the Event;
but of this it is not convenient to &s;peak
in this place.</P>
<P>The Duke was preparing to go to pay
his Re&s;pects to the Dutche&s;s of <HI>York,</HI>
when word was brought him, that the
Prince of <HI>Newburg</HI> being arriv'd lately,
the King requir'd him to conduct that
Prince to the Ball, which was to be at
the Queens that Night. He cou'd do no
le&s;s than obey. He had &s;een that Prince
before in his Travels, when he continu'd
for &s;ome time in the Dominions of the
Duke his Father. He was receiv'd by
him with all the Honour and Re&s;pect he
might expect from a young Prince of an il|lu&s;trious
Birth, and the Rank he him&s;elf
bore in the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Court. The Prince of
<HI>Newburg</HI> did not fail to come in good
time to wait on the King, that he might
&s;tay for &s;ome time with him, before the
Ball began. He was a very hand&s;om Per|&s;on,
of a beautiful Countenance, and a
very agreeable Deportment; he danc'd
with a very good Grace; and as he was
<PB N="459" REF="320">
Ma&s;ter of &s;everal Languages, it was ea&s;ie
for him to enter into Conver&s;ation with
&s;uch as he lik'd be&s;t.</P>
<P>Among all the re&s;t that made their Ap|pearance
at the Ball, my Lady&mdash;
pleas'd him mo&s;t. She being then in a
melancholy Temper, occa&s;ion'd by the
Infidelity of the Earl of <HI>A</HI>&mdash;<HI>n,</HI> made
her Eyes appear with a certain langui&s;hing
Sweetne&s;s, which was very de&s;irable; the
whitene&s;s of her Complexion was not
faded, her Lips as red as Coral, and a
certain carele&s;s Air, natural to Women
when they have no Conque&s;t in view, were
more becoming in her, than the borrow'd
and artificial Charms of all the re&s;t. She
was in &s;o eminent a Station at Court,
that her Name alone was &s;ufficient to
make her to be taken notice of by a foreign
Prince. He drew near to her with a Com|pliment:
Which &s;he returning with a
great deal of Civility, he made it his
bu&s;ine&s;s to entertain her in Di&s;cour&s;e all
that Night, which &s;he was well enough
plea&s;ed with; for let a hand&s;om Woman
be never &s;o indifferent, &s;he loves to be taken
notice of before others; and looking upon
this as a proof of her De&s;erts, Self-love
will not give her leave to neglect &s;uch an
opportunity. She had, be&s;ides this, another
in&s;ight in the Matter, <HI>viz.</HI> the Earl of
<HI>A</HI>&mdash;<HI>n</HI> being at the Ball, &s;he was am|bitious
to kindle &s;ome &s;parks of Jealou&s;ie
in him. She perceiv'd him much out of
Humour, and con&s;equently gue&s;s'd he

was troubl'd in his Mind. He did not &s;peak
to <HI>Emilia,</HI> and this young Lady had never
made a wor&s;e &s;hew than &s;he did at that
time, her Eyes not appearing with their
u&s;ual Sprightline&s;s, or Fire, unle&s;s when &s;he
ca&s;t them towards my Lady; and remem|bring
the Ink-bottle, &s;he di&s;cover'd a cer|tain
de&s;ire of Revenge, which &s;he cou'd
&s;carce keep within the bounds of Mode|ration;
but as often as &s;he look'd towards
the Earl of <HI>A</HI>&mdash;<HI>n,</HI> &s;he had not courage
enough to let them continue that way;
and a redne&s;s, which over-&s;pread her whole
Face, was an undeniable witne&s;s of the
&s;ecret Reproaches &s;he felt at the Adven|ture
of the Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI> in the
Hamper. The Duke wou'd fain have ta|ken
the opportunity of the Ball, to &s;eat
him&s;elf by, and to &s;peak to her, had not
<HI>Philadelphia,</HI> who was not far off, &s;poil'd
his Intentions of talking with one, with|out
being over-heard by the other. Cou'd
he have &s;poke to <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> he wou'd
have been tolerably well &s;atisfy'd, but he
labour'd under the &s;ame Difficulty with
her, in re&s;pect of the nearne&s;s of <HI>Emilia;</HI>
be&s;ides that, the Earl of <HI>A</HI>&mdash;<HI>n</HI> and
Madam&mdash;(who came to the Ball
chiefly for that purpo&s;e) kept a watchful
Eye over him. The Duke finding him&s;elf
under this <HI>Dilemma,</HI> was yet more &s;ur|priz'd
at the coming of <HI>Nelly.</HI> 'Tis known
to every body, that &s;he was an Actre&s;s,
and that the King delighted in her more for
her diverting and agreeable Humour, than
<PB N="461" REF="324">
for her Per&s;on, tho' &s;he made a pretty
good figure; but &s;he was &s;o very &s;pright|ly
and gay in Conver&s;ation, as to make
all the Company to partake of her merry
Di&s;po&s;ition. She enter'd masked, and
di&s;gui&s;ed in Shepherde&s;&s;es Habit, attend|ed
by &s;everal other Ladies and Gentlemen
of Quality, all in the &s;ame Dre&s;s. Af|ter
having danced &s;ome Country-Dances,
which &s;he perform'd very well, (tho' her
way of dancing was as odd and &s;ingular
as all the re&s;t of her Actions) &s;he exclaim'd
again&s;t the heat of the Room, and that it
were more convenient to take a little fre&s;h
Air. 'Tis true, the Sea&s;on being not very
proper for &s;o numerous a Company to be
enclos'd in a Room, they were not a little
incommoded with the Heat.</P>
<P>The Queen, who took no great diver|&s;ion
at the Ball, being retired into her own
Appartment, the Ladies of Honour of the
Dutche&s;s of&mdash;, who were there pre&s;ent
with their Governe&s;s, aro&s;e in order to be
gone. But the King order'd them to fol|low
him with the re&s;t of the Ladies into
the <HI>Park.</HI> The King and Prince of <HI>New|burg,</HI>
attended by the whole Court, and
follow'd by the Mu&s;ick, went into the
<HI>Bowling-Green,</HI> where &s;ome &s;eated them|&s;elves
upon Benches, &s;ome upon green
Turfs. They danc'd in divers places at
once; and it being a clear bright Night,
there was no occa&s;ion for Lights; the Flutes
and Hautboys an&s;wering by means of the
Eccho to the Violins. This Entertain|ment,
<PB N="462" REF="325">
tho unfore&s;een, and unconcerted,
prov'd infinitely agreeable and diverting.</P>
<P>Every thing being tran&s;acted there in a
kind of plea&s;ing Di&s;order, there was a &s;uf|ficient
opportunity of talking to one an|other,
without being ob&s;erv'd. My Lady
&mdash;&s;eeing the Earl of <HI>A</HI>&mdash;<HI>n</HI> pa&s;s
behind certain Palli&s;ado-Rails, again&s;t
which &s;he was leaning at that time, went
out of one of the <HI>Bowling-Green</HI> Doors,
in order to meet him. The Earl, not a
little &s;urpriz'd thereat, was at a &s;tand
whether to turn back; he having, during
the Ball, look'd much more favourably
upon her, than he had done for a long
time before. He acco&s;ted her, Oh! Mad|am,
&s;aid he, how happy wou'd this mo|ment
&s;eem to me, were you the &s;ame you
us'd to be in my regard. <HI>Ungrateful,</HI>
&s;aid &s;he, how cou'd you think it po&s;&s;ible?
Can you imagine I cou'd forget the Game
you have plaid me? With what indiffe|rence
you receiv'd my Compliments, with
what Di&s;dain you &s;poke of me to my Face
in the Queens Gallery; what an&s;wer you
return'd to a Letter, which ought to have
touch'd you to the Heart; and what
Pains you took to convince me of your In|fidelity?
And you have done it &s;o effectu|ally,
that I &s;hall never forgive it. Will
you never pardon me, Madam, cry'd the
Earl, drawing nearer to her, and taking
her by the Hand? Is it po&s;&s;ible you &s;hou'd
take a Re&s;olution &s;o oppo&s;ite to what you
<PB N="463" REF="326">
have promis'd me before? Can you ima|gine,
that during the&s;e frail Intervals I
&s;pent with <HI>Emilia,</HI> I cou'd attempt to
promi&s;e I never wou'd love you? You
are likely enough to attempt or to do any
thing, per&s;idious Man! reply'd my Lady;
you wou'd have thru&s;t a Dagger into my
Heart to purcha&s;e one favourable Look
from her. 'Tis no difficult matter for me
to &s;ee, that you are at odds together, but
I &s;uppo&s;e 'tis her, and not your Fault;
&s;he has found the way of making you a
&s;ubmi&s;&s;ive and patient Creature. You
connive at her light Actions, you love her
not a jot the wor&s;e, and you &s;ee your Ri|val
preferr'd before you, with &s;o &s;weet
and calm a Temper, as can't be &s;ufficient|ly
commended. Oh! Madam, cry'd the
Earl, 'tis too hard to in&s;ult over me, I was
ju&s;t upon the point of putting your Fetters
on again, I felt within my Brea&s;t certain
Sparks of Fire, which being not well
couch'd, were ready to kindle afre&s;h; but
you add Ironies to your Reproaches.
There is nothing I wou'd not do to be
reveng'd, reply'd &s;he, an enrag'd Heart
knows no bounds of Moderation.</P>
<P>She had continu'd her Di&s;cour&s;e, if
they had not been &s;ilenc'd by a noi&s;e they
heard not far from thence. At the &s;ame
time &s;he e&s;py'd the Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI>
with <HI>Emilia;</HI> as the&s;e two had an equal
de&s;ire to Di&s;cour&s;e one another, they
got into an Arbour, in order to clear the
point, concerning what Matters of Com|plaint
<PB N="464" REF="327">
one might have again&s;t the other&punc;
Do you &s;ee here two Per&s;ons, &s;aid &s;he,
to the Earl of <HI>A</HI>&mdash;<HI>n,</HI> who, I am apt
to believe, have no occa&s;ion for &s;uch a
witne&s;s as you of their Conver&s;ation; not|with&s;tanding
which, your Intere&s;t lying
&s;o far at &s;take as it does, I will not rob
you of the plea&s;ure of hearing them.
This is a &s;atisfaction I &s;hou'd be glad to
&s;acrifice to you, reply'd he, were it not
that your Eyes betray the Aver&s;ion you
have again&s;t me. My Re&s;pects forbids
me not to detain you any longer with an
unhappy Man, who is in&s;upportable to
you. Say rather, return'd &s;he, at parting,
that what mo&s;t torments you, is your
Curio&s;ity.</P>
<P>My Lady went away, and &s;he was not
in the wrong to imagine, that the Earl
was very glad to hear the Conver&s;ation
betwixt the Duke and his Mi&s;tre&s;s. He
crept very &s;oftly to the place where they
were, he li&s;ten'd attentively, and &s;eeing
the Duke with one Knee upon the Ground
at <HI>Emilia</HI>'s Feet, he heard her continue
her Di&s;cour&s;e, which &s;he had began be|fore.
Before my Face, &s;aid &s;he, barbar|ous
Man! under my very Eyes you have
made me &s;ee in yours all the marks of
a violent Pa&s;&s;ion, as if you had never lov'd
any thing but her. This haughty Rival
pretended to fall into a Swoon, for no o|ther
rea&s;on, than to en&s;nare you the
deeper, and you acted without controul,
and with a very &s;lender regard to my Pre|&s;ence.
<PB N="465" REF="328">
Ju&s;t Heav'ns! Was I to be an eye-witne&s;s
of what I wou'd have remain'd
doubtful of all the Days of my Life? Your
Surmizes, Madam, reply'd the Duke,
wou'd perplex me, had I by my Conduct
given any real occa&s;ion for it. But I pro|te&s;t
to you, <HI>Emilia,</HI> you have no real rea|&s;on
of Complaint; I have &s;hewn &s;ome
Compa&s;&s;ion for a dying young Woman;
wou'd you have me to have a&s;&s;i&s;ted in
choaking her; and to plea&s;e your Humour,
left her without, or beyond all hopes of
Relief? You ought to have done it, cry'd
<HI>Emilia,</HI> you ought to have con&s;ider'd the
Trouble it would cau&s;e in me; you ought
to have &s;uppre&s;s'd my Jealou&s;ie by a pro|cedure
quite contrary to what you did;
and you may be per&s;uaded, had you re|mov'd
all cau&s;e of Complaint again&s;t you,
<HI>Philadelphia</HI> &s;hould not have wanted any
thing that was either convenient or nece&s;&s;a|ry.
But here was the Touch&s;tone; you dur&s;t
not tru&s;t any body el&s;e, becau&s;e you were
willing to do every thing your&s;elf, this
was indeed the be&s;t way to revive her
Colour in her Lips. Do you remember
what proofs of a mo&s;t tender Affection
you ventur'd to give her? They were &s;o
indifferent to me, &s;aid he, that I have al|ready
forgot them. Oh! perfidious Man,
&s;aid &s;he, I know you only too well, and not|with&s;tanding
all what I have &s;een, I will
rather blind my own Eyes, my Rea&s;on,
my Re&s;entment, and flatter my&s;elf that I
am &s;till very dear to you. You are &s;o,
<PB N="466" REF="329">
my lovely <HI>Emilia,</HI> above every thing in
the World, reply'd the Duke, and you
&s;hall be convinc'd thereof by my Con|duct.</P>
<P>The Conver&s;ation now ri&s;ing to &s;o high a
pitch of Tenderne&s;s, put the Earl of <HI>A</HI>&mdash;<HI>n</HI>
into &s;uch a ferment, that he had certainly
broke out into &s;ome outrageous Action,
had it not been for the King's Pre&s;ence,
who ju&s;t then happen'd to pa&s;s by that
way with <HI>Nelly,</HI> being follow'd by the
Pr. of <HI>Newburg,</HI> who leading my Lady&mdash;,
it &s;eem'd as if he &s;poke to her with more
than ordinary Affiduity, and as if &s;he
hearken'd to him with more Attention
than is u&s;ual betwixt Per&s;ons of a few
Hours Acquaintance.</P>
<P>To &s;peak the Truth, never was any
Man in a more melancholy and di&s;turbed
Condition than the Earl of <HI>A</HI>&mdash;<HI>n</HI> at
that time. He heard on one &s;ide the Con|ver&s;ation
betwixt <HI>Emilia</HI> and the Duke of
<HI>Monmouth;</HI> he &s;aw on the other hand my
Lady with a foreign Prince, and him&s;elf
alone, overwhelm'd with Jealou&s;ie and
Vexation. He could not endure to &s;tay
any longer in a place where it &s;eem'd as
if all that were there were in&s;pir'd with
nothing el&s;e but Love and Mirth. He left
the <HI>Bowling Green,</HI> but pa&s;&s;ing through a
very thick Wood, heard a Per&s;on fetch
&s;uch deep and violent Sighs, that it &s;eem'd
as if &s;he, that fetch'd them, was breathing
her la&s;t. The Earl being touch'd with
Compa&s;&s;ion, and reflecting upon his own
<PB N="467" REF="330">
Condition, thought he &s;hould be well-pleas'd
to meet with one under the &s;ame
Circum&s;tances, that they might bemoan
their Misfortunes together, and prove a
Comfort to one another. So approaching
to the place as &s;oftly and near as he could,
he heard her expre&s;s her&s;elf thus: O un|fortunate
Woman! that my Heart &s;hould
be engaged to &s;o fickle and uncon&s;tant a
Man! What can I hope for in this fatal
Inclination? He loves <HI>Emilia,</HI> and I &s;hall
die for Grief. Here &s;he &s;topt, but &s;oon
rea&s;&s;uming her former Di&s;cour&s;e; Is it
po&s;&s;ible, &s;aid &s;he, I &s;hould flatter my&s;elf,
and that the Tenderne&s;s I have for him
&s;hould make more lively Impre&s;&s;ions upon
my Mind, than all tho&s;e Expre&s;&s;ions I
heard him utter to my Rival. Oh! too
fatal a Curio&s;ity for the Repo&s;e of my
Life! I &s;hall pay very dear for it! I was
under an uncertainty which afforded me
&s;ome room for flattering my&s;elf; but now
am beyond all doubt, and almo&s;t di&s;tracted
for being undeceiv'd.</P>
<P>The Earl of <HI>A</HI>&mdash;<HI>n</HI> very well knew
the Voice of <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> but would not
come too near, for fear &s;he might have
&s;omebody or other with her. But hearing
nobody &s;peak but her, without receiving
any An&s;wer, he &s;oon imagin'd it was
the violence of her Grief that made her
break out into the&s;e Complaints. And &s;o
it prov'd, for coming nearer, he &s;aw her
alone, lying upon a green Turf under a
Tree. She hearing a noi&s;e, turn'd her
<PB N="468" REF="331">
Head, and &s;eeing him &s;o near her, was
forely afraid he might have over-heard
her; &s;he began to reflect upon her own Im|prudence,
to have thus reveal'd the Secret
of her Pa&s;&s;ion; and the Earl might ea&s;ily
gue&s;s at the pre&s;ent Condition of her Heart.</P>
<P>Don't fear, <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> &s;aid he, all
the Tenderne&s;s you have for a Per&s;on
whom I have &s;o much rea&s;on to hate,
&s;hall never oblige me to betray your Frail|ty:
I can hold my Tongue, and even
compa&s;&s;ionate your Misfortune. It would
be con&s;iderably encreas'd, &s;aid &s;he, if you
&s;hould go about to revenge your&s;elf
upon the Duke of <HI>Monmouth,</HI> &s;ince it
mu&s;t furni&s;h new matter of Trouble to
me; and if you did, which I hope you
will not, he would be little di&s;turbed there|at
upon my account; he loves nobody but
<HI>Emilia,</HI> and if he has told me &s;ome oblig|ing
things, it was only to deceive me.
And why, &s;aid the Earl, &s;hould you be &s;o
fond of him, if you know him to be &s;uch
a fickle Per&s;on? O! my Heart, that frail
Heart of mine, &s;aid &s;he, &s;urrender'd
without con&s;ulting my Rea&s;on; I found I
lov'd before I was aware of the Effects
his Pre&s;ence and Conver&s;ation had pro|duc'd
in me. But, my Lord, continu'd
&s;he, the better to moderate my Grief, let
me have this Comfort, to believe that
you will forget all the Extravagances
you heard me &s;peak.</P>
<P>Re&s;t &s;atisfy'd upon my account, fair
<HI>Philadelphia,</HI> reply'd he, I promi&s;e to keep
<PB N="469" REF="332">
your Secret, and I am a Man of Honour:
But I do declare to you, that, if you are &s;o
frail, as not to de&s;i&s;t from loving him, I&mdash;
He had &s;carce &s;poke the&s;e Words, but he
&s;aw him not above ten Paces di&s;tant. Hah!
What are you a doing here, &s;aid the Duke
of <HI>Monmouth,</HI> with a fierce Countenance,
laying his Hand to his Sword? The Earl
of <HI>A</HI>&mdash;<HI>n,</HI> without &s;peaking one word,
fac'd about in a fighting Po&s;ture, and in
&s;pite of the re&s;pect due to the King's Pal|lace,
the Quarrel would not have ended
without a fatal Event, had not <HI>Philadel|phia,</HI>
with an unparellel'd Courage, thrown
her&s;elf betwixt them; whil&s;t &s;he was con|juring
them to reflect upon what they
were going to do. The Duke of <HI>Buck|ingham,</HI>
who was not far of, hearing a
confus'd Noi&s;e of &s;everal Voices he knew
very well, drew nearer, and &s;aw what
pa&s;s'd. He intreated them in Conjuncti|on
with <HI>Philadelphia</HI> to de&s;i&s;t, and being
an intimate Friend of the Duke, and the
Earl's Uncle, urg'd the Matter &s;o home
betwixt them, that they engag'd, upon
their Parole of Honour, not to Fight till
he had taken full Cognizance of the
Matter.</P>
<P><HI>Philadelphia</HI> was going to retire: But
the Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI> intreated her mo&s;t
earne&s;tly to hear him for one moment.
Tho' &s;he had all the rea&s;on in the world
to refu&s;e him this Favour, yet finding her|&s;elf
not Mi&s;tre&s;s of her own Curio&s;ity,
&s;he &s;taid behind. Am not I, &s;aid he, the
<PB N="470" REF="333">
mo&s;t unfortunate of all Lovers? I love
you, <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> but am not able to con|vince
you of it. You believe <HI>Emilia</HI> alone
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es my Heart, and you are angry upon
that account, but without rea&s;on. You
ought to con&s;ider, that if I am obliging
to her, 'tis becau&s;e I would not have her
intermeddle with me, and for fear, le&s;t
her jealous Temper &s;hould create you &s;ome
Trouble. You act your Part too well
to the Life, reply'd &s;he, for one not to
believe that there is a great deal of
Truth in this Fiction. I am apt to per|&s;uade
my&s;elf, that you have &s;ome Incli|nations
towards me, becau&s;e you make
nothing (after the rate you love) of loving
&s;everal at a time. But, my Lord, you
will find it a hard Task to make me forget
tho&s;e di&s;obliging Words you &s;poke up|on
my account to <HI>Emilia.</HI> I did not come
there to dive into your Sentiments; nay,
I freely confe&s;s, that as far as it depends
on me, I would never be undeceived; that
would be more to my Satisfaction. For,
when I heard you &s;peak thus, I was &s;o
far touch'd, that I had died upon the &s;pot,
had I not been re&s;erv'd for more durable
Mi&s;eries. O <HI>Philadelphia!</HI> cry'd the
Duke, how unju&s;tly do you deal with
me? I find, notwith&s;tanding the&s;e flatter|ing
Intervals, you are going to hate me;
and of all my Misfortunes, this touches
me in the mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible Part. May it
plea&s;e Heavens! &s;aid &s;he &s;miling, may it
plea&s;e Heavens! my Lord, you prove &s;in|cere
<PB N="471" REF="334">
for once in all your Life; but this is
a thing I dare not &s;o much as expect; and
as the prejudice I have conceived is &s;trong
again&s;t you, you mu&s;t not propo&s;e to your|&s;elf
to remove it in a &s;hort time. Adieu,
&s;aid &s;he, I mu&s;t be gone, our Governe&s;s
believes me to be very ill at this time. I
got from her under that Pretext, and told
her I would go to Bed immediately; but
happening to pa&s;s through this Wood,
Darkne&s;s, Solitude, and Troubles invited me
&s;o far, as to &s;tay here and vent my Grief,
which I had no power to re&s;i&s;t. I owe this
to my good Fortune, &s;ays the Duke, en|deavouring
to &s;top her, 'tis &s;he that has
given me this opportunity of a&s;&s;uring you
I am yours only, and if you heard me
&s;peak any Words contrary to this Truth,
it was by way of Di&s;&s;imulation. I was
never in an Intreague, reply'd <HI>Philadelphia;</HI>
but I am of opinion, that if one loves &s;in|cerely,
one can't betray one&s;elf to &s;uch a
degree as you did, and I di&s;pi&s;e &s;uch Poli|ticks
as make one di&s;own one's own Senti|ments.
You are in the right, Madam,
&s;aid he ha&s;tily, you &s;hall not upbraid me
long with that, I will gain&s;ay all the
Lyes I have told her; I will declare the
Tenderne&s;s I have for you, if it rai&s;es a
Di&s;cour&s;e, if <HI>Emilia</HI> grows Extravagant,
you ...... No, my Lord, no, don't do
&s;o, cry'd <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> I am &s;atisfy'd, I
will be per&s;uaded, take care of my Repu|tation,
nothing is dearer to me in the

<P>It was broad Day before the Duke of
<HI>Monmouth</HI> came back to the Prince of
<HI>Newburg,</HI> whom he conducted Home,
and &s;o they parted. The Earl of <HI>A</HI>&mdash;<HI>n,</HI>
more grieved than ever, was &s;en&s;ible that
if he &s;hould go home alone, he &s;hould be
overwhelm'd with a thou&s;and vexatious
Reflexions. He wanted one unto whom
he might make his Complaints; and as
the Duke of <HI>Buck$ngham</HI> had been pre&s;ent
at the late Quarrel betwixt the Duke of
<HI>Monmouth</HI> and him&s;elf, he thought it
better to go to his Lodgings than any
other place. He did not &s;tay long before
the Duke came; for being a Per&s;on who
delighted much more in private Plea&s;ures
than publick Fea&s;ts, he con&s;ented him&s;elf
with &s;taying a little while, whil&s;t the
King entertain'd the <HI>German</HI> Prince, and
then went home.</P>
<P>I am overjoy'd, &s;aid he, to the Earl of
<HI>A</HI>&mdash;<HI>n,</HI> to &s;ee you here; methinks
we have both occa&s;ion to meet; for, ac|cording
to all appearance, you have &s;uffi|cent
rea&s;on of Complaint, and I am inclin'd
to relate to you the mo&s;t diverting Ad|venture
that ever you heard of, which
happened to me. Our Condition is very
<PB N="473" REF="336">
different, &s;aid the Earl; you have cau&s;e
to rejoice, but I to bemoan my&s;elf. Which
of us two &s;hall &s;peak fir&s;t? You &s;hall,
poor my Lord, &s;aid the Duke, with an
obliging Air; becau&s;e my Relation may
&s;erve in &s;ome mea&s;ure to efface the grie|vous
Idea's of yours.</P>
<P>Never, &s;aid the Earl, was poor Lover
wor&s;e u&s;ed than my&s;elf: Vex'd to the
Heart I went to the Ball, with no other
intention than to expo&s;tulate with <HI>Emilia:</HI>
But &s;he &s;hun'd me &s;o dexterou&s;ly, that I
could not come near enough to &s;peak to
her; and all the &s;atisfaction I had, was
to keep an eye upon her, and to prevent
the Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI> from entring into
Conver&s;ation with her. But whil&s;t I
was thus bu&s;ied in interrupting them, I
ca&s;t my Eyes upon my Lady&mdash;, and
&s;he appear'd to me alone much hand|&s;omer
than all the other Ladies together,
tho' her Dre&s;s was rather neat than mag|nificent,
but attended with a certain neg|ligent
Air, which, in my opinion, became
her extreamly well. I was under no &s;mall
Perplexity I could not leave my Seat
without giving opportunity to the Duke
of <HI>Monmouth</HI> of talking to her; and I
could not look upon my Lady with &s;o
wi&s;hful an Eye and Countenance, without
an extream de&s;ire to come nearer to her,
and to tell her, that upon the fir&s;t favou|rable
Look, my Fire would be rekindled
in my Heart. To be &s;hort, I labour'd
under a &s;trange confu&s;ion of Thoughts at
<PB N="474" REF="337">
divers times, upon what rea&s;on I had to
prai&s;e her, and to blame <HI>Emilia;</HI> and
what methods I &s;hould make u&s;e of, to
ask pardon of one, and be&s;tow the mo&s;t
bitter Reproaches upon the other. Some|times
I flatter'd my &s;elf with Hopes,
&s;ometimes I run almo&s;t into De&s;pair,
when I con&s;ider'd I had lo&s;t both my Mi|&s;tre&s;&s;es,
and I cur&s;ed my&s;elf for my In|gratitude
to one of them. Thus &s;wal|low'd
up in an aby&s;s of different Thoughts.
Yet was my aim only upon her, till my
Jealou&s;y conceiv'd again&s;t <HI>Emilia,</HI> which
had been kept in &s;u&s;pen&s;e by my Pa&s;&s;ion
for my Lady&mdash;, got new Strength,
and cau&s;ed me fre&s;h Inquietudes. Yes,
my Lord, I found my&s;elf all on fire with
Rage and Anger, when, after &s;ome time,
I turn'd my Head to &s;ee where <HI>Emilia</HI> was,
but I might look long enough, for &s;he
and the Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI> were vani&s;h'd.
I found al&s;o new matter of di&s;traction in
my Lady and the Prince of <HI>Newburg,</HI>
who, both in the Room where the Ball
was, and in the Bowling-Green, was con|tinually
at her heels; no &s;ooner had he
left off dancing with another Lady, but
he would &s;eat him&s;elf again next to her,
&s;ometimes he would lie at her Feet, pre|$e$ding
he did it for the conveniency of
the coolne&s;s of the Gra&s;s; &s;ometimes he
would &s;tand and cool her with a Fan; he
pre&s;ented her with Oranges, and he affected
to eat what &s;he had ta&s;ted before. The&s;e
little Trifles, which an indifferent Per&s;on
<PB N="475" REF="338">
would not as much as have minded, ap|pear'd
like mon&s;trous things (as you know
very well) in the eyes of a Lover; and
what mo&s;t of all vex'd me, was, that &s;o
often as I look'd upon her, &s;he affected to
oblige the Prince with &s;ome gracious Air,
more in&s;upportable to me, than if &s;he had
&s;tuck a Dagger into my Heart.</P>
<P>Oh! my Lord, &s;aid the Duke of <HI>Buc|kingham</HI>
&s;miling, you are &s;oon vex'd.
Don't interrupt me, I conjure you, &s;aid
the Earl, for I am willing to come to the
period of the Relation of my Frailties.
I tell you, being almo&s;t reduc'd to De|&s;pair
by her Coquetteries, I perceiv'd, as
I told you before, that <HI>Emilia</HI> had given
me the &s;lip. Here again I was reduc'd to
no &s;mall Perplexity. I had a mind to
follow <HI>Emilia,</HI> and at the &s;ame time in|clin'd
to ob&s;erve the Tran&s;actions betwixt
my Lady and the foreign Prince. My
Heart thus divided betwixt the&s;e two dif|ferent
Intere&s;ts, remain'd undetermin'd
what to chu&s;e: At la&s;t it carry'd it for
<HI>Emilia.</HI> But whil&s;t I was &s;till in &s;earch
after her, I e&s;py'd my Lady&mdash;alone
coming the &s;ame way; and without Pre|&s;umption
I am apt to believe &s;he came
thither to look for me. This Reflexion
cau&s;ed in me a certain &s;ecret Satisfaction,
which I dur&s;t not di&s;cover till I might be
&s;atisfied in her Sentiments concerning me.
I di&s;cover'd mine to her, but found her
aver&s;e and very &s;atyrical; and after ha|ving
made me to &s;uffer a thou&s;and Re|proaches,
<PB N="476" REF="339">
&s;he left me abruptly. I was
almo&s;t beyond my&s;elf at &s;o unlucky an
Adventure; but in&s;tead of following her,
I was very attentive in overhearing the
incon&s;tant <HI>Emilia.</HI> Oh! what did &s;he
not &s;ay to the Duke of <HI>Monmouth?</HI>
Their Conver&s;ation was partly Reproaches,
partly tender Expre&s;&s;ions intermix'd with
Tears; and in the conclu&s;ion, they gave
one another fre&s;h a&s;&s;urances of a violent
Pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>You acted there but a very melancholy
Part, my dear Nephew, cry'd the Duke
of <HI>Buckingham.</HI> I was going to act a
Tragedy, reply'd the Earl, and to &s;eek
for the Satisfaction deny'd me by Love:
In my Revenge, I was ju&s;t going, &s;aid I,
to enter the Arbor where they had hid
them&s;elves, when the King, with <HI>Nell,</HI>
attended by many of the Court, happen|ing
to pa&s;s that way, I found it no &s;ea|&s;onable
time to commit Extravagances:
So leaving the place that had prov'd &s;o
fatal to my Repo&s;e, I re&s;olv'd to find out
another more &s;uitable to my pre&s;ent con|dition,
and then it was I heard <HI>Philadel|phia</HI>
in the Wood.</P>
<P>Drawn thither by her Lamentations
and bitter Complaints, I came as near as
I well could; I heard all &s;he &s;aid for
&s;ome time, and I declare to you, whether
it were out of Compa&s;&s;ion, or out of Re|venge,
or out of Inclination, it being na|tural
to love what &s;eems aimable to us,
I was &s;en&s;ibly touch'd with her Grief,
<PB N="477" REF="340">
and could willingly have &s;upplanted the
the Duke of <HI>Monmouth.</HI> I told her of
his Incon&s;tancy, and the unfortunate Con|&s;equences
&s;he mu&s;t expect from &s;uch an
Engagement which would prove fatal to
her Repo&s;e: I repre&s;ented to her his fic|kle
Temper; and began in&s;en&s;ibly to
in&s;inuate my &s;elf into that Di&s;cour&s;e,
when chance brought him &s;o near us, as
to overhear part of what we &s;aid; we
were going to decide our Quarrel when
you came and prevented us.</P>
<P>I prai&s;e Heavens for it, my Lord, &s;aid
the Duke of <HI>Buckingham,</HI> I &s;hould have
run di&s;tracted for your &s;ake, and the Con|&s;equences
that would have attended it.
The King, exa&s;perated by an Action
which &s;hew'd &s;o much want of Re&s;pect
to his Per&s;on, would perhaps have made
you pay dear for this Extravagancy. One
mu&s;t not at all times follow one's &s;plene|tick
Inclinations, and this is not the fir&s;t
time you have had the unfortunate Tem|ptation
of drawing your Sword again&s;t
the Duke of <HI>Monmouth.</HI> You may tell
me, it was a Misfortune to draw my
Sword in the Royal Palace; but for the
re&s;t, I think it an honour for the Duke
to mea&s;ure his Sword with me. Let us
not differ upon the point, &s;aid the Duke
of <HI>Buckingham;</HI> you know that I, being
more advanced in Years than you, and the
Uncle of your Wife, have a fair pre|tence
to talk to you, both as to my Friend,
and as my Relation&punc; You honour me
<PB N="478" REF="341">
very much in &s;o doing, reply'd the Earl,
and in looking upon me under that Qualifi|cation;
but I am per&s;uaded al&s;o, that
you take me to be the mo&s;t unfortunate
of Mankind. Without di&s;pute, &s;aid the
Duke; and I never &s;aw any Intreagues
go on &s;o un&s;ucce&s;sful as yours: You
would be happy if you could lay them
a&s;ide. Nothing but time, reply'd he,
can clear my Head of the&s;e Chimera's,
wherewith it is po&s;&s;e&s;s'd all over. I in|tend
to go into <HI>Ireland</HI> to my Father, I
will forget my Lady, I will dete&s;t <HI>Emi|lia,</HI>
and I will not remember <HI>Philadel|phia.</HI></P>
<P>The Duke fell a laughing: A Lover
who&s;e Heart is &s;o much divided as yours,
need not &s;ave him&s;elf by flight; if you
love in two or three places, 'tis no more
than playing; and Coquertry has a grea|ter
&s;hare in it than real Pa&s;&s;ion. What do
you &s;ay, cry'd the Earl of <HI>A</HI>&mdash;<HI>n?</HI>
What do you mean? I am &s;en&s;ible I
was born for Love, and where ever my
Heart fixes, it engages too far for its own
Repo&s;e. But, continu'd he, after having
abu&s;ed your Patience, in giving you an
account of my Di&s;a&s;ters, pray tell me
what it is that makes you look with &s;o
chearful a Countenance?</P>
<P>You remember, &s;aid the Duke, the Bil|let
of the Counte&s;s, which was brought
me at my Lord of S. <HI>Albans</HI>'s Hou&s;e. I
left you both not without a great deal of
regret; I &s;hut my&s;elf up in my Clo&s;et,
<PB N="479" REF="342">
and I order'd the &s;ame <HI>Valet de Chambre</HI>
that brought the Counte&s;s's Billet, to let
no body come to me, except her&s;elf, or
any Me&s;&s;enger from her. It began to be
late, I was told the King wanted to &s;peak
with me; but being re&s;olv'd not to &s;tir
abroad, word was &s;ent I was not at home.
You are &s;en&s;ible with what impatience
one expects what one loves; without the
lea&s;t exaggeration, every Hour &s;eem'd to
me a Day. At la&s;t comes a Man into my
Clo&s;et, dre&s;s'd like a Me&s;&s;enger, with an
<HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Cap on his Head pull'd over his
Face, booted and &s;pur'd, and a Whip in
his Hand, who pre&s;ented to me a Letter
from the Counte&s;s, which I am going to
read to you.</P>
<P>Every thing &s;eems to prove contrary to
the de&s;ire I have of &s;eeing you: I flatter'd
my&s;elf that <HI>E&s;ther</HI> might have Dexterity
enough to convey me out of my Hou&s;e
without being &s;een; but all her Contrivance
can't come up to that of my jealous Hu&s;|band:
He watches me more carefully than
if I were a Pri&s;oner of State, guilty of
&s;ome capital Crime, for whom he was to
be re&s;pon&s;ible. I declare to you I am al|mo&s;t
de&s;perate, I fear every thing, and
hope for little&punc; my only Comfort under
the&s;e Misfortunes, is, that I believe you
are &s;en&s;ible of them, and that you will
neglect nothing that may put an end to
them.</P>
<P><PB N="480" REF="343">
The reading of this Billet cau&s;ed me
abundance of Vexation; I found my&s;elf
fru&s;trated of a Plea&s;ure wherewith I had
flatter'd my&s;elf; and I fear'd that in en|deavouring
to do a piece of Service to the
Counte&s;s again&s;t her Husband, it would
make &s;uch a Noi&s;e at Court, as might
compleat $word$ Ruin&punc; I was ruminating
upon the&s;e Matters, and the Me&s;&s;enger &s;taid
all this while: At la&s;t I ask'd him, whe|ther
he would undertake to deliver my
An&s;wer to the &s;ame Per&s;on that had gi|ven
him the Letter? He &s;aid, No; and
that he was going into <HI>Wales</HI> to carry
&s;ome Di&s;patches from the King. Well,
Friend, &s;aid I, go where you will, and &s;o
gave him &s;ome Guineas for his Reward.
He went to the Door, but as he was pul|ling
off his Cap to take his leave, I per|ceiv'd
a Head of Hair, which being of
the fine&s;t Colour in the world, &s;pread all
over the Shoulders down to the Knees.
The pretended Me&s;&s;enger throwing them
a&s;ide, di&s;cover'd a little Hand whiter
than Snow, and a mo&s;t charming Face.
Why &s;hould I amu&s;e you any longer? Don't
you gue&s;s, my Lord, it was the Coun|te&s;s.
I mu&s;t confe&s;s the plea&s;ure of the
Surprize was no &s;mall addition to that of
&s;eeing her. I made her &s;en&s;ible of my
Satisfaction by &s;uch lively Expre&s;&s;ions,
but &s;o di&s;orderly withal, that my Di&s;tur|bance
&s;ufficiently di&s;cover'd to her the
pre&s;ent &s;tate of my Heart. Her Pre&s;ence
had wip'd out all the remembrance of
<PB N="481" REF="344">
my Re&s;entment, I thought no more of
tho&s;e Reproaches I intended to have made
to her; &s;he her&s;elf was the fir&s;t that en|tred
upon the point of my la&s;t ill Recep|tion:
She told me, her mi&s;tru&s;tful and
jealous Husband had &s;hut him&s;elf up in a
Clo&s;et adjoining to the Room, where he
could hear and &s;ee, without being &s;een,
all &s;he &s;aid or did. Would you, con|tinu'd
&s;he, have me expo&s;e you to the
Fury of a Madman, who might have ta|ken
the opportunity of being too hard for
you and me, under pretence of finding
you in di&s;gui&s;e in his Hou&s;e? Nobody is
&s;o brave, but he mu&s;t give way to great
odds.</P>
<P>I a&s;&s;ure you, the&s;e are the Rea&s;ons that
oblig'd me to put Bounds to my Inclina|tions:
I dur&s;t not turn my Eyes towards
you, I trembled when I &s;poke to you, I
was afraid le&s;t he &s;hould di&s;cover you,
and I cho&s;e rather to appear cold, un|grateful
and &s;cornful, than to &s;ee you
and my Husband a quarrelling. 'Tis not
for the care you have taken of me I re|turn
you Thanks, &s;aid I, my dear lovely
Counte&s;s, for I dare venture to &s;ay, your
Husband will con&s;ider of it twice before
he attacks me once; but &s;tand highly
indebted to you in re&s;pect of your&s;elf;
and you may re&s;t a&s;&s;ured, I am a thou|&s;and
times more &s;en&s;ible of it, than what
relates immediately to my&s;elf.</P>
<P>She told me afterwards, that in order
to get out of the Doors, &s;he was obliged
<PB N="482" REF="345">
to di&s;gui&s;e her&s;elf under the Dre&s;s I &s;aw
her; and what was mo&s;t diverting, was,
that &s;he had got a Pacquet of Letters
brought and directed to him, to deliver
to him in ca&s;e he &s;hould meet her; and
that nothing could have happen'd more
luckily, becau&s;e he came home the &s;ame
Moment with my Lord <HI>Grey</HI> when &s;he
went out; that without the lea&s;t concern
&s;he met him and gave him the Pacquet,
and &s;o went her ways. You get off very
fortunately, &s;aid I; but, good God! what
mea&s;ures have you taken to get home a|gain
without trouble? I don't que&s;tion
it, reply'd &s;he; <HI>E&s;ther</HI> is to pretend I am
not well, and a&s;leep, to prevent the Earl
from coming into my Chamber. Alas!
Madam, added I, is that all? I am afraid
you'll pay dearly for the plea&s;ure of this
Vi&s;it. Would you have me to leave you
longer in a Mi&s;take, which mu&s;t needs
have exa&s;perated you again&s;t me? I would
rather have any thing, &s;aid I, interrupt|ing
her, nay even Death it&s;elf, than &s;ee
you expos'd to the lea&s;t Danger. My
Lord, cry'd &s;he, don't di&s;turb the Sweets
of our Pa&s;&s;ion with needle&s;s Fore&s;ights,
let it happen as Heaven thinks fit; but
let us not de&s;pair of our good Fortune.
Her Re&s;olution &s;eem'd to me as convin|cing
a Proof of her Tenderne&s;s, as my
Fearfulne&s;s ought to be to her of my Pa&s;|&s;ion.
However, I obey'd her Orders, and
did not touch upon any thing that might
di&s;turb her good Di&s;po&s;ition. I a&s;&s;ure
<PB N="483" REF="346">
you, my Lord, &s;uch a Reconciliation has
&s;omething of extraordinary Sweetne&s;s in
it for a &s;en&s;ible Heart; and that the&s;e
Hours, which &s;eem'd &s;o long to me whil&s;t
I was expecting her coming, appear'd ve|ry
&s;hort in her Company; her Pre&s;ence
heal'd up all the Wounds of Jealou&s;y, I
remembred no more what Pa&s;&s;ion the King,
the D. of <HI>Monmouth,</HI> and my Lord&mdash;
had once for her. She told me a thou&s;and
times, I was the only Man &s;he thought
worthy her E&s;teem; and I find too much
&s;atisfaction in believing her, to trouble
my head with any thing that might per|&s;uade
me to the contrary. At la&s;t, the
parting Hour being come, we took our
leaves at Day break; and to allay my
Fear, I pray'd her to put a Ribbon out of
the Window as a token that &s;he got &s;afe
home. I pa&s;s'd by &s;oon after that way,
and &s;eeing the Ribbon, was better &s;ati&s;|fied
than the greate&s;t Man in the world,
and thence went to the <HI>Park</HI> to &s;ee part
of the Fea&s;t.</P>
<P>This is the pre&s;ent &s;tate of my Affairs.
You may conclude from thence, that
things are never reduced to &s;o de&s;perate a
condition betwixt a Lover and his Mi&s;tre&s;s,
but that they may take a happy turn a|gain.
I have &s;worn bitterly at my Lord
S. <HI>Albans,</HI> that I would never &s;ee her a|gain
as long as I lived; you are a witne&s;s
to what a degree of Spite and Anger I
had rai&s;ed my Thoughts, and how often
I have reproach'd my&s;elf. Good God&punc;
<PB N="484" REF="347">
is it po&s;&s;ible one &s;hould commit a gro&s;&s;er
Error than this? I have &s;hewn you her
Letters, I have told you things which
ought to have been buried in everla&s;ting
Silence; I am only too happy to have
done the&s;e things before two Men who
can keep a Secret. What mu&s;t have be|come
of me by this time, had I put my
Confidence in Men of a &s;u&s;pected Faith?
In &s;uch a ca&s;e, the Reputation of the Coun|te&s;s
mu&s;t &s;uffer for my extravagant Sur|mi&s;es.
Learn to be wi&s;er, by my Exam|ple,
continu'd he, with a very &s;erious
Countenance, and take this for a con&s;tant
Rule, that a gallant Man ought at no
time, nor upon any account whatever, $o
revile a Lady, whether &s;he has given him
occa&s;ion of Satisfaction or Complaint.
You talk at your own plea&s;ure, my Lord
Duke, cry'd the Earl of <HI>A</HI>&mdash;<HI>n:</HI> But
your Condition and mine being &s;o diffe|rent,
I am not &s;urprized our Opinions
&s;hould be &s;o too. You have all the rea|&s;on
to be &s;atisfied, and I to complain. If
you have a mind to revive your Intreague
with my Lady, added the Duke, and will
leave the management of that Matter to
me, I am much mi&s;taken if I don't bring
her back. I can &s;carce believe it, reply'd
the Earl; &s;he has only too much rea&s;on
of Complaint again&s;t me; and when I
call to mind what har&s;h Treatment &s;he
had from me, (believing that I &s;poke to
<HI>Emilia</HI>) I don't wonder to &s;ee her treat me
like a Stranger. Add to this, what the
<PB N="485" REF="348">
Prince of <HI>Newburg</HI> does to gain her good
will, and the obliging way wherewith &s;he
receives his Addre&s;&s;es. If this Prince was
to &s;tay long in <HI>London,</HI> continu'd the Duke,
I would not &s;wear for her, but that &s;he
might be for a change; and that, were it
only for the plea&s;ure of a compleat Re|venge,
&s;he might &s;et you a&s;ide, and put
the Prince in your place; but at the wor&s;t
this would prove only an Intreague of a
few Weeks, which mu&s;t end in trouble,
the natural con&s;equence of ab&s;ence. She
has loved you, and I'm &s;ure &s;he does not
hate you. Once more, will you have me
try for a Compo&s;ition betwixt you? The
Earl pau&s;ed a while, but at la&s;t de&s;ired
him to act in it with the &s;ame application
as if it were for him&s;elf.</P>
<P>The King having taken a re&s;olution to
go to <HI>Hampton Court,</HI> and to take the
Prince of <HI>Newburg</HI> along with him, in
order to divert him there with a Ball, the
next day every thing was got in readine&s;s
to carry the Court thither by Water. The
Barges were cover'd with <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Carpets,
the ground-work of Gold, and hung with
brocaded Tape&s;tries of Ro&s;e colour and
Silk. Towards the Evening, the Court
having taken their re&s;pective Places in
the Barges, you &s;aw them go forward by
the help of Oars upon that &s;pacious Ri|ver
the <HI>Thames,</HI> which is perhaps the
hand&s;ome&s;t in the World. You heard the
Air re&s;ound with a mo&s;t agreeable Sym|phony
of Trumpets, Kettel-Drums, Flutes,
<PB N="486" REF="349">
Violins, Voices, Theorbes and Clave-Cymbals.
The&s;e different In&s;truments
produc'd different Chorus's, which play'd
every one in their turn; and the Con|&s;ort
was &s;o well contriv'd, that no|thing
could be more plea&s;ing or enticing
in the World. The foreign Prince ad|mir'd
the Beauty of <HI>London,</HI> where all
the great Hou&s;es, &s;tanding on the River-&s;ide,
are adorn'd with Balcones, and at that
time were fill'd with hand&s;om Ladies, who
came to &s;ee the King in this Pomp, and
to hear the warlike Sound of the Kettel-Drums,
or the &s;weet Harmony of the
Violins. <HI>London</HI> affords the fine&s;t Pro|&s;pect
that can be imagin'd from the River
<HI>Thames,</HI> and I que&s;tion whether any other
comes near it among all the other Cities
of <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>The Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI> having taken
notice that the Prince of <HI>Newburg</HI> ad|dre&s;s'd
him&s;elf more frequently to my
Lady&mdash;than to any of the other La|dies
at Court, manag'd the matter &s;o
as to place him next to her. And as &s;he
was of opinion, that if any thing could recal
the Earl of <HI>A</HI>&mdash;<HI>n,</HI> it would be a point
of Jealou&s;ie, which often brings back the
fugitive Lover, and revives the Heart, &s;o &s;he
affected to have no other regard but for
the Prince, and to hear him with atten|tion,
as if &s;he was plea&s;ed and &s;en&s;ible of
what he &s;aid to her. He, on his part,
omitted nothing to make her accept of
the Gallantries he told her, and he was
<PB N="487" REF="350">
de&s;erving enough to flatter him&s;elf he
&s;hould not meet with a Repul&s;e; Won't
you think me too bold, Madam, &s;aid he,
if I take this opportunity to give you to
under&s;tand the progre&s;s you have made in
my Heart? I know I ought to endeavour
to gain your Inclinations by my A&s;&s;iduity
and Services, and to convince you of mine
before I &s;peak of them to you; but that
little Time I have to &s;tay in this Court
being too &s;hort to hope for &s;ucce&s;s that
way, I mu&s;t, Madam, conjure you to
&s;horten my Pain, and to accept of the Of|fer
I make you of a Heart which has not
as yet receiv'd &s;uch lively Impre&s;&s;ions as
yours. It would be highly glorious for
me, &s;aid &s;he, if I could flatter my&s;elf in|to
a belief that you tell me the truth;
who can a&s;&s;ure me of that Point? Man|kind
make not the lea&s;t &s;cruple of impo|&s;ing
upon Ladies; and we know, by long
Experience, how dangerous you are; they
make it their bu&s;ine&s;s to en&s;nare them,
whil&s;t they keep out of the Trap. Oh!
Madam, what is it you &s;ay? &s;aid the
Prince, interrupting her. Is it po&s;&s;ible
you &s;hould imagine that one would covet
to be beloved only, and that by &s;o aima|ble
a Per&s;on as you are? You &s;ee 'tis I that
makes the beginning, and I &s;hould not fail
to make the conclu&s;ion, were I Ma&s;ter
of my De&s;tiny, &s;o as to &s;tay with you as
long as I would. Alas! why were you
not born in my Country? or, why mu&s;t I
leave yours? Don't di&s;turb your&s;elf upon
<PB N="488" REF="351">
that &s;core, &s;aid &s;he, I don't de&s;erve your
care, and you would perhaps be unhap|py
if you &s;hould engage too far upon
my account. For God's &s;ake, cry'd he,
pray tell me the rea&s;on. The rea&s;on is,
becau&s;e among my Friends I am always of
a &s;weet, even Temper, and in a good Hu|mour;
but to tho&s;e who pretend to more,
I am fooli&s;h, capricious and tyrannical;
I con&s;ider them no otherwi&s;e than my
Slaves; I have not the lea&s;t complai&s;ance
for them; I defy them and my&s;elf; and
if I find the lea&s;t favourable Inclination
for them, I bani&s;h them for ever. I am
contented with all this, &s;aid the Prince;
only give me leave to &s;erve you, and to
endeavour all means to plea&s;e you; per|haps
&s;ome more benign Star than that
which is predominant over tho&s;e unfortu|nate
Wretches you treat thus cruelly, may
alter the ca&s;e in my behalf. This is a
&s;tretch of Vanity, &s;aid my Lady, not un|becoming
a Sovereign Prince. Well then,
Sir, &s;erve me, I accept of you for my
Knight. And I you for my Lady, reply'd
he, with a merry Countenance; and turn|ing
his Head, repeated with an indiffe|rent
loud Voice that Ver&s;e out of the
<HI>French</HI> Tragedy of <HI>Cid:</HI></P>

<P>The Duke of <HI>Buckingham,</HI> and the Earl
of <HI>A</HI>&mdash;<HI>n,</HI> who &s;at next to one another,
were at too great a di&s;tance from the
<PB N="489" REF="352">
Prince and my Lady to hear their Conver|&s;ation,
but could not mi&s;s of hearing the&s;e
l$&s;t Words, both of them under&s;tanding
<HI>French</HI> very well. The Earl told the Duke,
we need not doubt but that this young
Prince intends to bid defiance to all my
Ladies Lovers; had I no other Reflexion
to make than what relates to my Courage&punc;
I &s;hould &s;oon appear in the Li&s;t of them,
and make him know, that he is not the
<HI>Cid</HI> of <HI>England.</HI> What a fine pretence
you have found out of picking a Quarrel,
reply'd the Duke; would you have a Lover,
in the beginning of his Pa&s;&s;ion, talk like
Men who have their Rea&s;on and true Sen|&s;es
about them? Be not unea&s;ie, I will take
care of your Intere&s;t, and you &s;hall have
no rea&s;on to be di&s;&s;atisfy'd. Whil&s;t they
were talking together, <HI>Nelly,</HI> who was in
the &s;ame Barge, had found out Matter of
Diverti&s;ement for the Ladies and Gentle|men;
and among the re&s;t, one which oc|ca&s;ioned
a great deal of Mirth. She de|&s;ir'd
the King to &s;top a little upon the
Water, the better to enjoy the benefit of
the fair Sea&s;on and the melodious Har|mony
of Mu&s;ick. She then cau&s;ed to be
brought forth &s;ome Angling Rods, with
&s;ilk Lines, the Hooks of Gold. The
King went to Angling with &s;everal others,
but could catch nothing, whereat the
Ladies laught very heartily, and the King
told them he would Angle no longer; and
&s;o pulling up his Line, found half a dozen
of fry'd <HI>Smelts</HI> ty'd to the Hook with a
<PB N="490" REF="353">
&s;ilk Thread. He fell a laughing aloud,
and &s;o did every body el&s;e. <HI>Nelly</HI> told
him, that &s;o great a King &s;hould have
&s;omething peculiar above the re&s;t; that
poor Fi&s;hermen catch Fi&s;h alive, but
his were ready dre&s;s'd. The Prince of
<HI>Newburg</HI> told them, that &s;ix being not
enough, he would try whether he could
take two or three more to the King's
Fi&s;h. He threw his Line, and feeling it
weighty, O Sire! &s;aid he, we &s;hall live mer|rily;
and &s;o pulling it up, found a Pur&s;e ty'd
to the Hook which, being open'd, there
was in it a golden Ca&s;e &s;et with Stones, and
the Picture of my Lady&mdash;. This
occa&s;ion'd a general Mirth, and the King,
who was ignorant that <HI>Nelly</HI> had order'd
&s;ome Divers to tie the Fi&s;h and Picture
to the Hooks, was above all extreamly de|lighted
with it. <HI>Cleopatra,</HI> &s;aid he, to
<HI>Nelly,</HI> caus'd a <HI>Sardine</HI> to be ty'd to <HI>Mark
Anthony</HI>'s Hook, but you exceed her in
your Contrivance, for you be&s;tow Pictures,
which are much more acceptable. The&s;e
are Pre&s;ents, &s;aid my Lady, (&s;omewhat
concern'd) which co&s;t her nothing. She
&s;ent this Morning to my Hou&s;e, to tell
me, that &s;he being inclin'd to have her
Picture drawn, &s;he de&s;ir'd I would &s;end
her mine, becau&s;e &s;he would take a view
of the Drapery. You &s;ee, Sir, to what
u&s;e &s;he has put it. Nothing could hap|pen
more agreeable to me, &s;aid the Prince;
I know not, &s;aid he, adre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to
<HI>Nelly,</HI> how to pay you my Re&s;pects &s;uf|ficiently.
<PB N="491" REF="354">
I &s;hould be very glad to merit
your Acknowledgments, an&s;wer'd &s;he; but
you thank me for a good Office I had no
hand in. I believe the&s;e were the <HI>Najades</HI>
of the <HI>Thames,</HI> who perform'd this act of
Gallantry on purpo&s;e to oblige you, and
if my Lady has an inclination to &s;ee her
Picture this Night, I have it at home,
and will &s;end for it.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t every one was enjoying the
Sweets of an agreeable Conver&s;ation, the
Earl of <HI>A</HI>&mdash;<HI>n</HI> was the only Per&s;on who
appear'd extreamly Melancholy. He could
not, without much di&s;&s;atisfaction, &s;ee the
Prince of <HI>Newburg</HI> to take this opportuni|ty
of telling a thou&s;and pretty Things to
my Lady; and his Fancy, which was very
ingenious in tormenting him, &s;ugge&s;ted
that &s;he had combin'd with <HI>Nelly</HI> to con|vey,
by this means, her Picture to the
Prince; and tho' he heard her tell him
very &s;eriou&s;ly, that &s;he de&s;ir'd he &s;hould
re&s;tore it to her immediately, he look'd
upon it only as a faint; his Jealou&s;ie ha|ving
rekindled a more violent Fire in his
Heart, than all her Tenderne&s;s and Cara&s;|&s;es
could do before. The Duke of <HI>Buc|kingham,</HI>
who read his Troubles in his Eyes,
would not leave him alone to his &s;ad
Reflexions, but check'd and told him,
with a low Voice; do you &s;ee how care|ful
I am of you, poor di&s;turb'd confound|ed
Lover; you don't as much as look at
<HI>Emilia,</HI> &s;he has talk'd above a quarter of
an Hour to the Duke of <HI>Monmouth,</HI> with|out
<PB N="492" REF="355">
your taking the lea&s;t notice of it.
O my Lord, &s;aid the Earl, 'tis not worth
one's while, &s;he is an incon&s;iderable, un|con&s;tant
Woman, more fit to act her Part
in a Play, than to engage a Man of Ho|nour;
I a&s;&s;ure you I am quite clear of her,
and am vex'd at the Frailties I have been
guilty of upon her account.</P>
<P>The Barges went forward with an ea&s;ie
Pace towards <HI>Hampton-Court;</HI> when on a
&s;udden they were &s;urprized with the &s;ight
of two others, exceeding all the re&s;t in
Magnificence; be&s;ides that, their manner
of appearance had in it &s;omething peculiar
to rai&s;e one's Curio&s;ity. The fir&s;t of the
two was full of hand&s;om well &s;hap'd Men
dre&s;s'd like the Antick Knights, as we &s;ee
them &s;till painted now a-days; in the
mid&s;t of them you &s;aw one in the &s;ame
Habit, but in Armour, <HI>Capapie</HI> his 'Squire
&s;tanding by him, and holding his Helmet,
adorn'd with white Feathers. Upon a
rich Pacillion of Green and Gold, you &s;aw
the Picture of a Lady, plac'd upon a Pe|de&s;tal,
&s;upported by <HI>Love,</HI> mo&s;t curiou&s;ly
Engraven. In the other Barge appear'd
nothing but Ladies attired like Nymphs,
with their Quivers hanging upon their
Backs, and their Arrows in their Hands.
A Lady, repre&s;enting <HI>Diana,</HI> had the pre|eminency
above all the re&s;t, as well by
rea&s;on of the richne&s;s of her Cloaths and
Jewels, as by her Age; it being certain,
that never was &s;o aged a <HI>Diana</HI> &s;een be|fore;
however, &s;he had certain ruins of
<PB N="493" REF="356">
Beauty, which were more valuable than
all her Attire. The King, and tho&s;e that
attended him, &s;oon di&s;cover'd him who
was in Armour in the fir&s;t Barge to be
the Duke of&mdash;, and the Lady,
who repre&s;ented the cha&s;t <HI>Diana,</HI> to be
his Wife. But the Prince of <HI>Newburg,</HI>
who knew nothing of them, took them
for a Band of Players, that were going to
act at &s;ome place or other near <HI>London,</HI>
till the Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI> undeceived
him. Do you &s;ee, &s;aid he, the&s;e Per&s;ons,
they have &s;omething very peculiar in them,
perhaps beyond any in the World. Him
whom you &s;ee there in the mid&s;t of the
other Gentlemen, is the Duke of&mdash;,
one of the greate&s;t Lords in <HI>England,</HI> be|ing
Ma&s;ter of an E&s;tate of Twenty five
thou&s;and Pounds a Year; and as there
are many other Lords of great E&s;tates,
who love to be independent, they take
the lea&s;t occa&s;ion of Complaint to retire
from Court into the Country, where they
lead an ea&s;ie Life. This Duke has a mo&s;t
magnificent Seat in the <HI>North,</HI> &s;eated in
the mid&s;t of Woods and Rivers, and of a
very difficult acce&s;s. This Solitude has
engaged both my Lord and my Lady to
reading to &s;uch an exce&s;s, that they &s;pend
Day and Night in it; and being but lit|tle
acquainted with the true choice of
Books, they are fall'n upon the reading
of <HI>Romances,</HI> and the Adventures of
Knight's Errant; the&s;e being things which
only &s;uit their Pallates, and that to ad|miration.
<PB N="494" REF="357">
Not only this, but they have
taken a fancy to imitate them, and to act
in their Country &s;ome of tho&s;e marvelous
things, which the <HI>Amadis's</HI> and <HI>Knights$
Errant</HI> perform'd in all parts of the World.
Is it po&s;&s;ible it &s;hould be as you tell me?
cry'd the Prince of <HI>Newburg.</HI> If you que|&s;tion
it, continu'd he, you may be &s;atisfy'd
in it by the whole Court, and by the
Duke of&mdash;him&s;elf, who marry'd
his Daughter. There needs no farther
confirmation than your Word, my Lord,
&s;aid the young Prince; and be&s;ides this, I
need only con&s;ult my own Eyes, it being
not very natural to appear in &s;uch a Dre&s;s
without &s;ome extraordinary rea&s;on. My
Lady&mdash;, &s;aid the Duke, will &s;ome|times
di&s;gui&s;e her&s;elf like an <HI>Amazon;</HI> &s;he
rides on Hor&s;eback, attended by nine
young Ladies of good Families, but with|out
Fortunes: The&s;e &s;he takes under her
Care, with a great deal of plea&s;ure, and
&s;ees them &s;ettl'd in the World, provided
they will comply to &s;hare with her in
the&s;e <HI>Romantick</HI> Fancies. The Duke acts
the Knight-Errant, he meets his Lady a|broad
a Hunting, or perhaps taking her
re&s;t in a Wood near &s;ome murmuring
Brook; he falls in love with her, and
makes his tru&s;ty 'Squire his Confident.
She, on her part, being an Heire&s;s of the
<HI>Invi&s;ible I&s;le,</HI> or of &s;ome <HI>Enchanted Pa|lace,</HI>
or repre&s;enting <HI>Armide</HI> or <HI>Medea,</HI> is
charm'd with the goodly Mien of the love|ly
Stranger; and notwith&s;tanding &s;he is
<PB N="495" REF="358">
engag'd already to a neighbouring Prince
of great Renown, being of the Stature
of a Giant, &s;he declares to her Nur&s;e, &s;he
will marry nobody el&s;e but the <HI>Knight of
the Wood.</HI> The&s;e Preliminaries of Love
are follow'd by all manner of Gallantries,
or to &s;peak properly, by all the Extrava|gances
that can be imagin'd, &s;uch as Fea&s;ts,
Combats, and a thou&s;and other Imperti|nences;
and the whole concludes with
the Nuptials of this noble Pair.</P>
<P>This Ceremony is no &s;ooner over, but
they torment their Brains to &s;et up an|other
fictitious Story; they are provided
with Actors for that purpo&s;e, richly attir|ed,
and all other Nece&s;&s;aries, for they
are exce&s;&s;ive Rich, &s;pending but little,
but what they be&s;tow upon &s;uch like Fop|peries.
I can't be $ir'd with hearing your
Relation, my Lord, &s;aid the Duke of
<HI>Newburg,</HI> and a &s;mall matter would incline
me to go to vi&s;it them at their Seat, to
become a Spectator of one of the pure&s;t
diverting Comedies that a Man can well
&s;ee. Before they had quite fini&s;h'd their
Di&s;cour&s;e, they &s;aw a Boat coming from
the Duke's Barge, in which was his 'Squire
and two Watermen. The King having
&s;topt his own Barge, they drew near to
it, and the 'Squire began thus: Sire, the
Duke of&mdash;, my Ma&s;ter, offers his
mo&s;t humble and profound Services to
your Royal Maje&s;ty, and &s;alutes the
whole illu&s;trious Company that attends
you; he de&s;ires to know, whether there
<PB N="496" REF="359">
is among&s;t them all, a Knight, who will
maintain that his Lady is a more exqui|&s;ite
Beauty than &s;he who&s;e Picture you
&s;ee there upon that glorious Pavillion?
And under your Maje&s;ty's good leave, I
will conduct him &s;afely to my Lord Duke,
that they may make trial in the open Field,
which of them two is mo&s;t capable of
maintaining the Beauty of her he loves.
In &s;pite of all the Gravity the King had
affected, during this Harangue, he could
not forbear laughing two or three times;
but &s;oon rea&s;&s;uming his &s;erious Air, go
tell your Ma&s;ter, &s;aid he, 'tis impo&s;&s;ible
to di&s;cover the Lineaments of the Picture
he &s;o much boa&s;ts of, at &s;uch a di&s;tance,
that he mu&s;t &s;end it to us, that we may
be able to judge whether he is in the
right or not, and that then he &s;hall have
his An&s;wer. The 'Squire hereupon, pulls
out of his Pocket a Picture, telling the
King, this was the Copy of the fair Ori|ginal
which his Ma&s;ter adored. There
was &s;carce any body there but what knew
it to be the Picture of the old Dutche&s;s,
painted in a Shepherde&s;s's Habit, with a
Garland of Flowers about her Temples,
&s;uch as we commonly &s;ee <HI>A&s;trea</HI> pre&s;ented
by the Painters. The King could not for|bear
laughing aloud at the &s;ight thereof,
and the 'Squire would have done the &s;ame,
but that he dur&s;t not. This Lady is too
beautiful, &s;aid the King, for any one to
pretend to di&s;pute the precedency with
her; I am &s;ure every one here will &s;ub|mit.
<PB N="497" REF="360">
Not at &s;o ea&s;ie a rate, &s;aid the
Prince of <HI>Newburg;</HI> I have a mind,
Sire, to maintain the Beauty of this Lady,
whereof I here &s;hew you the Picture, and
who&s;e Knight I declare my&s;elf to be; he
produced that of my Lady&mdash;, and
comparing it with the other; Your Maje|&s;ty
&s;hall judge, continued he, which of
the&s;e has the mo&s;t Perfections. That of
the Shepherde&s;s, cry'd the King; Prince,
upon this occa&s;ion, Ju&s;tice mu&s;t prevail a|bove
Favour; and as you have a bad Cau&s;e,
my Judgment is, you mu&s;t own you are
in the wrong at pre&s;ent, and that nothing
but a blind Prejudice can be alledg'd in
your behalf. The 'Squire departed to
give an account to his Ma&s;ter of his good
Succe&s;s. Never was any Man better
pleas'd, he ran and told it the Dutche&s;s,
who conceived &s;o much Joy thereat, that
&s;he was not her own Mi&s;tre&s;s, nor could
contain her&s;elf within the bounds of a
<HI>Decorum;</HI> but as her Barge pa&s;s'd by that
of the King's, &s;he &s;tood as upright as a
Dart, being &s;o fully per&s;uaded of her ha|ving
got the better of all the Ladies that
were there pre&s;ent, that &s;he afforded
&s;ufficient matter of Mirth to the Court,
for that time.</P>
<P>You mu&s;t under&s;tand, &s;aid the Duke of
<HI>Buckingham</HI> to the Prince of <HI>Newburg,</HI> that
no Woman in the World takes more pains
to pre&s;erve her Beauty, than this Lady
you have &s;een ju&s;t now; an Empirick, no
le&s;s extravagant than her&s;elf, had per&s;uad|ed
<PB N="498" REF="361">
her to have a Man well fatten'd, and
afterwards to de&s;til him, the Water
whereof, he told her, would revive her
Youth more effectually than the <HI>Fountain
of Youth.</HI> She not que&s;tioning but that
the Secret mu&s;t be good, becau&s;e it was
rare, found means to get a young Fellow,
of a beautiful Complexion, whom &s;he
&s;hut up in a Room, and caus'd him to be
fed with the be&s;t Dainties that could be
had. His whole time being employ'd in
eating and &s;leeping, he fatten'd apace,
and &s;o often as the Dutche&s;s came to look
upon him, &s;he would be &s;ure to tell him,
<HI>Friend, cram thy&s;elf well.</HI> At la&s;t the
Fellow being curious to know what made
her &s;o careful of his Belly; he ask'd the
rea&s;on of him who us'd to bring him his
Provi&s;ions? What, &s;aid he, do'&s;t thou not
know, that, &s;o &s;oon as thou bee&s;t well
fatten'd, thou mu&s;t be cut to pieces, and
be put into an Alembic for De&s;tillation,
to make the Dutche&s;s young again? At
the&s;e Words, the poor Pri&s;oner, being
ready to die with Fear, grew leaner and
leaner every Day with the Thoughts of
his approaching De&s;tiny; &s;o that at la&s;t
re&s;embling more a Skeleton than a Man,
and the Dutche&s;s &s;eeing him in this mi&s;e|rable
Condition, &s;et him at Liberty. She
was laying out for another to be fatten'd
for the &s;ame purpo&s;e: When the King
having got notice of her De&s;igns, &s;ent her
word, that he would advi&s;e her rather to
run the ri&s;que of being Old, than of his
<PB N="499" REF="362">
Indignation; and that if &s;he committed
&s;uch a barbarous Act, &s;he might well be
a&s;&s;ur'd, he would never pardon it. I mu&s;t
tell you, &s;aid the Prince of <HI>Newburg,</HI> a
Man ought to be an eye witne&s;s of the&s;e
things, before one can give credit to them;
however, your Di&s;cour&s;e is very divert|ing.
There are Stories enough of her,
which will hold us till we come to
<HI>Hampton-Court,</HI> &s;aid <HI>Nelly;</HI> as for in&s;tance,
She had caus'd &s;ix Bulls to be train'd up
to draw her Coach, which was of &s;uch a
bulk, that there were but few Streets
broad enough to afford it a pa&s;&s;age. How|ever,
&s;he would make her Appearance in
<HI>Hide-Park</HI> with her new Equipage; but
no &s;ooner began the Bulls to move for|ward,
when the Mob beginning to hallow,
&s;o frightned the Bulls, that they ran away
with the Coach, da&s;h'd it all to pieces,
and the Lady had enough to do to &s;ave
her Life. So &s;he was cur'd of her fancy
of training up Bulls.</P>
<P>This is a plea&s;ant Adventure, &s;aid the
Dutche&s;s of <HI>Richmond,</HI> but you mu&s;t all con|fe&s;s,
it does not come up to what &s;he did
at <HI>Whitehall.</HI> You mu&s;t know, that the
Dutche&s;s &s;eldom came to Court; and as
the Queen u&s;ed to make her her Diver&s;i|on,
&s;he order'd me to bring her to the
Circle. I knew &s;he was lately come out
of the Country, I went to Compliment
her in her Maje&s;ties Name, and after|wards
ask'd her, whether &s;he would not
pay her Re&s;pects to her? I would do her
<PB N="500" REF="363">
that Honour with all my heart, &s;aid &s;he,
provided &s;he would honour me with &s;ome
peculiar Mark of Di&s;tinction. I don't
que&s;tion, &s;aid I, but that the Queen will
do it with a great deal of plea&s;ure. Then,
reply'd &s;he, pray de&s;ire her, that my nine
Nymphs may hold up my Gown whil&s;t
I am at the Circle. The Dutche&s;&s;es in
<HI>France</HI> enjoy the Privilege of the Stool,
but this is not allow'd of in <HI>England,</HI> or
at lea&s;t our Train can't be held up without
particular leave. I promi&s;ed her I would
&s;peak to the Queen about it, and that
my&s;elf was &s;o far concern'd in it, as not
to neglect he Matter. Truly, &s;aid &s;he,
it is the common Cau&s;e you are going to
plead, and it will be very glorious for
you in time to come, to read in our Hi&s;to|ries,
that it was the Dutche&s;s of <HI>Rich|mond,</HI>
Daughter to the brave Duke of
<HI>Buckingham,</HI> who obtain'd that Privilege
from the Queen. I gave the Queen an
account of what had pa&s;s'd in our inter|view,
who laught very heartily, but
would not allow of that Privilege. I gave
the Dutche&s;s an account of my ill Succe&s;s,
who was much vex'd at it. But, &s;aid &s;he,
let me alone, I will &s;hew you I don't
want Wit. Within two Days after &s;he
came to the Circle, in a Gown of black
Velvet, the Ground-work Gold, and al|mo&s;t
covered with Jewels. The Train of
the Gown was of &s;uch a length that its
extremity reach'd into the Guard Chamber,
where it was held up by her nine Ladies;
<PB N="501" REF="364">
it appear'd like a blazing Star, which
reach'd through all the Appartments, and
I give you leave to gue&s;s, whether this
very Fancy was not the Subject of Diver|&s;ion
to all the World, and whether any
of us might have an inclination to imi|tate
it.</P>
<P>The Barges were now come to the
landing place: Whil&s;t my Lady <HI>Richmond</HI>
was yet a talking, and whil&s;t &s;he and
<HI>Nelly</HI> were entertaining the Prince of
<HI>Newburg,</HI> the Duke of <HI>Buckingham</HI> ad|dre&s;s'd
him&s;elf to my Lady&mdash;; You
act mo&s;t egregiou&s;ly the Coquet, &s;aid he,
if you can but hold this Humour, you
will be &s;ure to catch &s;omebody or other in
the Net. No Woman in the World,
&s;aid &s;he, loves Coquettry le&s;s than I, but
I am a little revengeful, and my bu&s;ine&s;s
is to be even with an ungrateful Per&s;on.
Oh! Madam, you have done your bu&s;i|ne&s;s
too much, reply'd the Duke; the
poor Earl of <HI>A</HI>&mdash;<HI>n</HI> feels the effects of
your ju&s;t Indignation, which touches him
to the very Heart. He has not &s;o much
Goodne&s;s in him, added my Lady, as to
be capable of repenting; but I am apt to
believe, he is fall'n out with <HI>Emilia,</HI>
and has a mind to rai&s;e in her &s;ome little
Jealou&s;ie, in order to be friends with her
again. Madam, continu'd the Duke, you
are not a Woman to be made u&s;e of for a
Cloak, and I can't have patience to hear
you treat your&s;elf &s;o indifferently, meer|ly
to gratifie your own de&s;ire of abu&s;ing
<PB N="502" REF="365">
the Earl. Your Charity, my Lord, &s;aid
&s;he &s;miling, is very exten&s;ive; and not|with&s;tanding
all this, you will find it a
hard Task to convince me; I have certain
cau&s;es of Prejudice again&s;t this ungrateful
Man, which will prove undeniable. I am
not come here, &s;aid he, to ju&s;tifie him,
I will own him to be as guilty as you
would have him, and as he actually has
been; call to mind his Incon&s;tancy, and
how he made a Sacrifice of &s;o well-fix'd
a Pa&s;&s;ion to the love he had for your Rival;
don't forget the In&s;tability of his Conduct
towards you, but after having remember'd
all that has rais'd your Anger again&s;t him,
remember it is the Earl of <HI>A</HI>&mdash;<HI>n,</HI> who
was once &s;o dear to you, and is &s;o &s;till;
he returns to you full of Tenderne&s;s and
Submi&s;&s;ion, reduc'd to De&s;pair for having
di&s;oblig'd you; and that, to make you
forget his Faults committed again&s;t you,
there is nothing but what you may not
expect from his Complai&s;ance. Believe
me, Madam, before you bid him quite
farewel, con&s;ult your own Heart. You
are very urgent, &s;aid &s;he, if you would
have me advi&s;e with my own Heart, you
mu&s;t allow me time to put the Que&s;tion.
No, Madam, an&s;wer'd the Duke, my
Honour lies at &s;take, I engaged to the Earl,
to bring him his Pardon &s;eal'd by your&s;elf,
a longer delay may throw &s;ome Ob&s;tacles
in the way. You have promi&s;ed what
was not in your power, reply'd &s;he, and
I &s;hould be very unwilling to be a Gua|rantee
<PB N="503" REF="366">
for tho&s;e Treaties you make: Is
it po&s;&s;ible for a Mini&s;ter of State to en|gage
&s;o far without con&s;idering the Mat|ter?
Let us talk with the Earl, &s;aid the
Duke interrupting her; ca&s;t an eye upon
him; &s;ee whether he has not the whole
Air of a Per&s;on touch'd to the Heart.
That is true, continu'd &s;he, but 'tis per|haps
<HI>Emilia</HI> that is the occa&s;ion of it.
No certainly, Madam, &s;aid he, drawing
nearer, <HI>Emilia</HI> has no farther Preten&s;ions
to my Heart, 'tis in your Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion alone,
and it owns nobody for its Soveraign
but you. Pray, &s;aid &s;he to him, how
long is it &s;ince you have learn'd the Se|cret
of what one &s;ays at &s;o great a di&s;tance
from you, and that with &s;o low a Voice,
that we &s;carce could hear one another?
Let us not talk of that, Madam, &s;aid he,
but how I came to di&s;plea&s;e you; let us
di&s;cour&s;e of my Repentance, and the A&s;|&s;iduities
I intend to pay you, to blot out
the ill Impre&s;&s;ions I have made in your
Heart. I &s;hall return you no an&s;wer, &s;aid
&s;he, till you have &s;atisfy'd my Curio&s;ity,
in telling me, by what Miracle you over|heard
me. The Duke of <HI>Buckingham,</HI> &s;aid
he, can tell you better than I; 'tis he that
put me in the way of it.</P>
<P>Becau&s;e you are &s;o re&s;olute, reply'd the
Duke, you mu&s;t know, that a certain
Per&s;on came to me &s;ome time ago with
an Offer to make in my Laboratory what
they call among the Arti&s;ts, <HI>The Great
Work,</HI> or commonly the <HI>Philo&s;ophers Stone.</HI>
<PB N="504" REF="367">
'Tis a thing I have been always very fond
of; but the be&s;t <HI>Philo&s;ophers Stone</HI> that I
could wi&s;h for, would be to cure me of
the de&s;ire of finding it. I mu&s;t interrupt
you, my Lord, &s;aid my Lady, to ask
you, whether the de&s;ire of making Gold
is not an effect of Avarice? As to what
concerns my&s;elf, I don't think it, con|tinu'd
he, for I want rather to know the
Secret for Curio&s;ity's &s;ake, than for its
U&s;efulne&s;s; and if I was to make any
u&s;e of it, it &s;hould be only to enrich
others, and to keep my&s;elf from Po|verty.</P>
<P>The Per&s;on who pretended to have this
Secret, &s;hew'd a great deal of Modera|ton
and Prudence in his Actions, had a
va&s;t Memory, &s;poke little, but very well,
was very well vers'd in all the terms of
Art, and appear'd very &s;incere. The
matter requir'd a long Preparation, he
liv'd in my Hou&s;e, amus'd me with a
thou&s;and Inventions, which would not
have pa&s;s'd for current with a Man le&s;s
prepo&s;&s;e&s;s'd than I was with the notion
of obtaining the Secret. At la&s;t, being
quite tir'd out with tho&s;e continual De|lays
wherewith he had fed my Impati|ence
hitherto; I told him po&s;itively, that
I would not be je&s;ted with any longer,
and that he mu&s;t either make Gold, or
el&s;e I would throw him out of the Win|dow.</P>
<P>This Alternative &s;eeming &s;omewhat
too hard for him, and not knowing what
<PB N="505" REF="368">
to do at this &s;lippery Conjuncture, he at
la&s;t judged that a &s;incere confe&s;&s;ion of his
Ignorance might have a better influence
upon me than all the fictitious Pretences
he could alledge; he threw him&s;elf at
my Feet, and, after a little Preamble,
begg'd my Pardon; telling me, with a
great deal of Sincerity, he had but a
very indifferent Knowledge in the Pre|paration
of the <HI>Philo&s;opher Stone,</HI> but
that, if I plea&s;ed, he would make me a
&s;mall Horn to be put into the Ear, and &s;o
&s;mall that it might be hid under the Hair;
and that keeping at a certain di&s;tance,
provided the Wind came from the &s;ame
Corner where I &s;tood, I might hear what
others &s;aid, let them &s;peak never &s;o low.
This Propo&s;ition appea&s;ed in &s;ome mea|&s;ure
my Anger, I order'd him to go about
it immediately; and I found him no Lyer
in that point, as I had in the other.</P>
<P>The Earl of <HI>A</HI>&mdash;<HI>n</HI> urging me to
&s;peak to you in his behalf, I promi&s;ed
him I would, and at the &s;ame time giv|ing
him the Horn, he by the help thereof
overheard our Di&s;cour&s;e. This is no bet|ter
than betraying one's Friend, cry'd my
Lady; &s;hould I not be very much pleas'd
if I had told you &s;omething which I
would not have confided to any body
el&s;e? I &s;hould have kept the Secret as
well as him&s;elf, Madam, &s;aid the Earl,
and I think my&s;elf very happy to have
&s;ome &s;hare in it; I am &s;ure I will never
make any ill u&s;e of it. My Lady&mdash;
<PB N="506" REF="369">
was well pleas'd with their Di&s;cour&s;e,
but he had been too much wanting in his
Re&s;pect, to pardon him &s;o &s;oon; &s;he
would make him &s;uffer for his Fault; &s;o
looking upon him with an affected In|differency,
Certainly, &s;aid &s;he, you mu&s;t
have but a very indifferent opinion of me,
if you imagine I can forget &s;o &s;oon your
Faults; don't you know, the more one
loves, the more one hates? He would
not acknowledge any thing again&s;t him|&s;elf,
but endeavour'd to convince her &s;he
was too rigorous, when they &s;aw the
King going a&s;hoar, and every body ma|king
what ha&s;te he could to follow him;
The Prince of <HI>Newburg,</HI> among the re&s;t,
was very forward to come up with my
Lady&mdash;, to give her his Hand, be|fore
the Dutche&s;s of <HI>Richmond</HI> and
<HI>Nelly.</HI></P>
<P>'Twas pretty late before they entred
the Palace; but the darkne&s;s of the
Night was &s;upplied by a mo&s;t noble Illu|mination,
by the King's orders. After a
noble Supper, every one went into the
Garden; and the Company was mo&s;t
agreeably &s;urpriz'd to &s;ee in the middle
of a Square, which faced &s;everal Walks,
a Theatre erected, where the Players act|ed
a very diverting Piece. The King was
&s;eated next to <HI>Nelly,</HI> the Prince of <HI>New|burg</HI>
next to my Lady&mdash;, and the
Earl of <HI>A</HI>&mdash;<HI>n</HI> behind her. The Duke
of <HI>Monmonth</HI> perceiving Madam&mdash;
and <HI>Emilia</HI> to look with a jealous Eye
<PB N="507" REF="370">
upon one another, kept at &s;ome di&s;tance,
to remove all occa&s;ion of di&s;pute betwixt
them. The Duke of <HI>Buckingham,</HI> &s;eeing
him&s;elf without his dear Counte&s;s, en|tred
into a &s;eparate Conver&s;ation with
my Lord of S. <HI>Albans.</HI> I am overjoy'd,
&s;aid the Earl to the Duke, to have this
opportunity of &s;atisfying my Curio&s;ity:
Pray tell me, did you &s;ee the Counte&s;s?
Yes, my Lord, &s;aid he, I have &s;een her,
and am charm'd with her: How far is a
Man mi&s;taken, to imagine one may be
cured of an exce&s;&s;ive Love Pa&s;&s;ion at plea|&s;ure.
I prote&s;t to you, my Fetters are
&s;tronger than ever; and my di&s;tracted
Mind, which was a continual torment to
me before, is now in the mo&s;t agreeable
&s;tate of Tranquillity that can be imagin'd.
I congratulate your Happine&s;s, reply'd he,
and could wi&s;h the Earl of <HI>A</HI>&mdash;<HI>n</HI> was
under the &s;ame happy Circum&s;tances: I
find he is exceeding Melancholy; do you
know the rea&s;on? He is jealous, &s;aid
the Duke; are you acquainted with that
Devil, call'd <HI>Jealou&s;y?</HI> Whoever is po&s;|&s;e&s;s'd
with this <HI>Daemon,</HI> mu&s;t bid fare|wel
to Rea&s;on, had he the be&s;t Head|piece
in the world. He is to be pitied,
continu'd the Earl; and after what has
happen'd, he ought to think no more of
<HI>Emilia.</HI> Do you believe 'tis for <HI>Emilia?</HI>
&s;aid the Duke; and for whom el&s;e? askt
the Earl. 'Tis for my Lady&mdash;, an|&s;wer'd
the Duke, I am heartily glad of
it, reply'd the Earl of S. <HI>Albans.</HI> Truly,
<PB N="508" REF="371">
I could not but pity her; but pray only
look upon her now, and &s;ee whether &s;he
does not appear with a triumphant Air?
Nothing makes a Lady look brisker, than
when &s;he has recover'd her Lover. And
tho' you &s;ee the young Prince of <HI>Newburg</HI>
entertain her at this time, I'm &s;ure &s;he
wi&s;hes him in <HI>Germany.</HI> I que&s;tion that,
return'd the Earl; the Addre&s;&s;es of a Per|&s;on
of his Rank in the World, are &s;el|dom
receiv'd with &s;o much Indifferency.
Pray ob&s;erve the motion of her Eyes
when &s;he looks at him: This does not
&s;eem as if &s;he was not well pleas'd. Oh!
my Lord, &s;aid the Duke, you make me
mad when you put me in mind how the
Spirit of Coquettry reigns both in the
Head and Heart of Women. This Rule
admits of an Exception, reply'd the Earl.
I am of opinion you need not fear any
thing upon that &s;core from your Coun|te&s;s;
and as for my Lady, I am apt to
believe &s;he knows what &s;he is doing. His
Judgment prov'd not ami&s;s, her Inclina|tions
being for the Earl of <HI>A</HI>&mdash;<HI>n;</HI>
but being re&s;olv'd to cha&s;ti&s;e him, &s;he
had pitch'd upon the young Prince as the
fitte&s;t In&s;trument to attain her end. They
did not &s;peak &s;o low but that the Earl
of <HI>A</HI>&mdash;<HI>n,</HI> who made u&s;e of the
Duke's Horn, overheard part of what they
&s;aid.</P>
<P>Tho' I was &s;ure, &s;aid the young Prince
to the fair my Lady, to be jeer'd &s;oundly
by you, I can't forbear telling you, that I
<PB N="509" REF="372">
am angry with my&s;elf for not accepting
the Duke's Challenge; Being engag'd
by Fortune, which put your Picture into
my hands, and by the honour you have
done me, in accepting me for your Knight,
to maintain your Beauty. Neither of
the&s;e two, reply'd my Lady, has put any
Obligation upon you. Tho&s;e Times are
pa&s;t when &s;uch kind of chimerical No|tions
u&s;ed to vanqui&s;h Rea&s;on, and make
People cut one another's Throats for a
Lady. And, &s;aid he, Madam, don't we
love now as they u&s;ed to do in former
Times? And &s;ince our Sentiments are
the &s;ame, why &s;hould not the Effects be
an&s;werable to them? For my part, I
&s;hould have been overjoy'd to have had
this opportunity of making the Duke
of&mdash;&s;peak with more re&s;pect of
your Beauty, than of any he ever &s;aw be|fore.
And for my part, &s;aid &s;he, I &s;hould
have been very much concern'd to &s;ee
my&s;elf made the Subject of &s;o odd an
Adventure; and if you were ever in ear|ne&s;t
to oblige me, this would not have been
the right way to do it. The E. of <HI>A</HI>&mdash;<HI>n</HI>
had a great inclination to make the third
Per&s;on in their Conver&s;ation, either to
interrupt their Di&s;cour&s;e, or to repartee
upon the Prince for pretending to fight a
Man who was noted throughout the
Kingdom for &s;uch-like odd Adventures of
his own contrivance; but that his Re&s;pect
for my Lady, and his fear of di&s;obliging
<PB N="510" REF="373">
her, made him refrain from this piece of
Curio&s;ity.</P>
<P><HI>Emilia</HI> never had a wor&s;e time of it
than during this Play, whither &s;he was
come in company of one of her Relations,
The Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI> did not &s;it near
her, and Madam&mdash;kept her Eyes
&s;o &s;teadfa&s;t upon her, that he had not &s;o
much opportunity as to afford her one
obliging Look&punc; He him&s;elf was as little
plea&s;ed with it as his two Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es;
and the be&s;t comfort he had for the pre|&s;ent,
was to enter into a Di&s;cour&s;e with
my Lord <HI>Grey</HI> upon that Subject. I am
re&s;olv'd, &s;aid he, to fix my&s;elf; nothing
can be more trouble&s;om than to be pe|&s;tred
with two at a time, each of which
claims an equal Prerogative of calling
you to an account for what you do; and
if you prefer one, yon mu&s;t di&s;oblige the
other: 'Tis quite otherwi&s;e if you love
one at a time. That's true, &s;aid my
Lord; but &s;uppo&s;ing this only Mi&s;tre&s;s
&s;hould not be very well, and con&s;equently
can't &s;tir abroad to meet you, or her jea|lous
Husband will keep her at home,
then you are left de&s;titute; whereas, if
you have three or four, you are &s;ure ne|ver
to mi&s;s or want; and if you happen
to meet them together, the Plea&s;ure is
the greater. You preach a Doctrine, &s;aid
the Duke &s;miling, you do not practi&s;e
your&s;elf: I know more of your Intreagues
than you think for, and perhaps more
than you are willing I &s;hould. What
<PB N="511" REF="374">
can you know, &s;aid my Lord, of a Man
that &s;carce &s;tirs from his Family, who as
yet acts the Lover with his Wife, and
who&s;e Plea&s;ure is centred in a Father and
Mother in Law? No que&s;tion, return'd
the Duke, with &s;omething of a malicious
Similer, but my Lord <HI>Barkley</HI> is the
Man that plea&s;es you be&s;t, and Madam
<HI>Barkley</HI> has found means to be with
you; but there is another you for|got
to mention, &s;he is the Mirrour of
Beauty and Sweetne&s;s; what do you
&s;ay to her? I &s;ay, reply'd my Lord
<HI>Grey,</HI> not without &s;ome confu&s;ion,
&s;he is a Child, and I take &s;o little
notice of her, that were &s;he not my
Relation, I &s;hould &s;carce know there
was &s;uch a one living. We will &s;ay no
more then, &s;aid the Duke, but I'll tell
you as a Secret, that I don't intend to
continue much longer at Court, being re|&s;olv'd
not to lead &s;uch an idle Life for the
future as I now do: I find my Heart tells
me, I was made for greater things than
to trifle away all my time with Women;
and if the King will be&s;tow upon me
the Command of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Troops in
<HI>France,</HI> I &s;hall be very ambitious to &s;ig|nalize
my&s;elf in that Po&s;t.</P>
<P>The Play being done, the King and the
Court retir'd every one to his Lodgings.
The next day the Ladies went abroad
with the King a hunting, &s;o gallantly
dre&s;s'd, that the Prince of <HI>Newburg</HI> de|clar'd
&s;everal times, the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ladies
<PB N="512" REF="375">
&s;urpa&s;s'd all the Women in the World.
Whil&s;t the King and the Court were a
hunting, my Lady&mdash;&s;taid at home,
pretending to have the Head-Ach, but
in effect to try what the Earl of <HI>A</HI>&mdash;<HI>n</HI>
would do upon this occa&s;ion. He attend|ed
the King till hunting was begun, then
&s;lipping a&s;ide unperceiv'd by any, he clap'd
Spurs to his Hor&s;e, and &s;o return'd to
<HI>Hampton Court.</HI> As this took up &s;ome
con&s;iderable time, my Lady&mdash;appear'd
much our of humour, and very unea&s;ie,
walking up and down the Room, up|braiding
her&s;elf with having &s;uch favour|able
Sentiments for the Earl, who had
given her &s;uch convincing Proofs of the
little Re&s;pect he bore her: But, when &s;he
&s;aw him &s;uddenly enter the Room, her
Satisfaction was &s;o great, that in vain &s;he
endeavour'd to conceal it, but found her|&s;elf
in&s;en&s;ibly betray'd, both by her Eyes
and Heart, and in &s;pite of her&s;elf, and
all her Re&s;olution, pardon'd her &s;ubmi&s;|&s;ive
Lover; And to convince him how
far &s;he preferr'd him before the Prince of
<HI>Newburg,</HI> &s;he promi&s;ed him to go back to
<HI>Whitehall</HI> the next Day. 'Tis ea&s;ie to
imagine with what Satisfaction the Earl
embraced the&s;e tender and obliging Of|fers,
and that he gave all po&s;&s;ible a&s;&s;u|rances
of his Gratitude and Acknowledg|ment.
The King was no &s;ooner return'd
from hunting, but he ask'd after my Lady,
and being told &s;he had the Head-Ach, he
went to vi&s;it her, taking the young Prince
<PB N="513" REF="376">
(who appear'd much concern'd thereat)
along with him. After a general Conver|&s;ation
of a few Minutes, the King went
away, telling him he left him in good
Company, and de&s;iring my Lady&mdash;
and &s;ome other Ladies, there pre&s;ent, to
entertain him.</P>
<P>Can you imagine, Madam, &s;aid he,
drawing nearer unto her with a low Voice,
can you imagine, I &s;hould have taken
the lea&s;t Diver&s;ion in this Hunting? To
know you to be &s;o ill, and not to be near
you, and now to be confined to &s;o little
time to &s;tay here; all the&s;e Reflexions
cau&s;e the mo&s;t cruel Torments to me that
can be imagin'd. You &s;peak &s;o &s;eriou&s;ly, &s;aid
&s;he, that to return you a &s;uitable An&s;wer,
I am oblig'd to tell you, that &s;o long as
our Conver&s;ation runs upon Amu&s;ements,
&s;uch as might be plea&s;ing to you, I did
accept of your engaging Expre&s;&s;ions, look|ing
upon them no otherwi&s;e than Pa&s;|times;
but &s;ince I am forced to &s;peak to
you upon other Terms, I declare to you,
I am not fond of having that Reputation
in the World, to &s;ay you had a more
peculiar E&s;teem for me, than for all the
re&s;t of the Ladies of our Court. The
Prince was highly &s;urpriz'd at &s;uch an
An&s;wer; but being of a haughty Temper,
and &s;till Ma&s;ter of his Heart, he told her,
in a very obliging manner: The Sentence
you pronounce again&s;t me, Madam, &s;eems
to me premediated for a con&s;iderable time
before. I confe&s;s, I want Merits to $word$
<PB N="514" REF="377">
my&s;elf to be able to plea&s;e a Lady of
&s;o exqui&s;ite a Palate, and you look upon
me to be a poor Traveller, fit to be turn'd
off with the fir&s;t opportunity. 'Tis done,
Madam, this Moment &s;hall be the la&s;t of
my Life, to tell you I love you. He had
&s;carce &s;poke the&s;e Words, but ri&s;ing from
his Seat, took his leave of the Ladies with
a mo&s;t profound Reverence. They look'd
at one another, much &s;urprized, and my
Lady mo&s;t of all, tho' &s;he, being the Per|&s;on
that knew the Cau&s;e, &s;hould have
&s;hewn the lea&s;t. But notwith&s;tanding her
firm Re&s;olution of be&s;towing her Heart
entirely upon the Earl of <HI>A</HI>&mdash;<HI>n,</HI> and
that it was to oblige him &s;he had made
this An&s;wer to the young Prince, &s;he was
not very well plea&s;ed to &s;ee him take her
&s;o punctually at her Word.</P>
<P>The King intended to &s;tay for &s;ome Days
longer at <HI>Hampton Court,</HI> but upon the
News of the Queen's being not very well,
he went to <HI>London</HI> the next Morning; for
it mu&s;t be own'd, they always liv'd in a
very good Harmony, and if &s;he was not &s;o
happy as to be Mi&s;tre&s;s of his Heart, yet
he always had &s;o much Re&s;pect and Defe|rence
to her, as in a great mea&s;ure &s;up|ply'd
the defects of an entire Union; and
upon this occa&s;ion, the Queen was &s;o &s;en|&s;ible
of the King's Goodne&s;s, that this prov'd
the chief cau&s;e of her &s;udden Recovery.</P>
<P>The Prince of <HI>Newburg,</HI> who had flat|ter'd
him&s;elf with vain Hopes, now &s;ee|ing
him&s;elf di&s;appointed by my Lady,
<PB N="515" REF="378">
re&s;olv'd to leave the Kingdom. But
&s;peaking to the King about it, he urged
him to &s;tay till his Birth-day was pa&s;t.
Upon this occa&s;ion, all the Ladies and
Gentlemen appearing at Court in the ut|mo&s;t
Splendor, the Prince took extream
delight in &s;eeing them. The Duke of
<HI>Monmouth</HI> did more than once endeavour
to di&s;cour&s;e <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> but could find
no opportunity, becau&s;e he was &s;o nar|rowly
watch'd by Madam&mdash;. She
finding the Duke out of humour, ask'd
him, what made him &s;o unea&s;ie? Oh!
&s;aid &s;he, how can you an&s;wer to be thus
di&s;&s;atisfy'd while you are with me? I
can't be otherwi&s;e, reply'd he, when I re|flect
upon your jealous and mi&s;tru&s;tful
Temper, that you watch me with your
Eyes, and would make me accountable to
you for a Look, a Sigh, nay, for the lea&s;t
thing that can be. Oh! my Lord, &s;aid
&s;he, I think you are too happy, to have
no other Matter of Complaint again&s;t
me; what thus affects you, ought to be
remembred to my advantage by you, if
your Heart was capable of knowing the
true value of mine; but I find one mu&s;t
love you according to your capacity;
you rather play the Coquet, than the
part of an engaging Lover. I am
free to tell you, this does not well agree
with my Con&s;titution; and therefore you
will much oblige me, if you will be
plea&s;ed to tell me your real Mind
at once. Well, Madam, reply'd the
<PB N="516" REF="379">
Duke, briskly, becau&s;e you command me,
I declare, that if you any longer pretend
to traver&s;e all my De&s;igns, and to prove
vexatious to tho&s;e I e&s;teem, you and I
mu&s;t break off for ever. You &s;hall have
my con&s;ent, cry'd &s;he, interrupting him,
you &s;hall have it with more plea&s;ure on
my &s;ide, than ever I heard you Vows and
Prote&s;tations. Be&s;tow them where you
think fit, I readily re&s;ign all the Power
and Right you gave me over your Heart;
and I will retake Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of my own.
Love <HI>Emilia,</HI> love <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> but take
heed not to love me any more. With
the&s;e Words &s;he aro&s;e, in order to take
another Seat. The Duke being &s;urprized
thereat, would have held her by her
Gown; but, full of Anger as &s;he was,
going away, did not perceive that the
Duke took out of her Pocket a Ca&s;e,
which by its outward appearance &s;eem'd
to contain a Picture. He had then no
opportunity of leaving the Queen's Ap|partment
in order to look upon it; tho'
he was impatient, to the highe&s;t degree,
to &s;ee it, being at that juncture taken with
a jealous fit, that &s;eem'd but little &s;uit|able
to a Man of &s;o incon&s;tant a Temper
as he was. But the&s;e &s;udden Motions
of Jealou&s;ie are not &s;o very extraordinary,
they proceeding &s;ometimes rather from
Self love, than from any Pa&s;&s;ion for an|other
Per&s;on. The Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI>
made trial of this Truth, and this was
<PB N="517" REF="380">
not the fir&s;t time he had occa&s;ion to
do &s;o.</P>
<P>The King's Birth day being celebrated
with all po&s;&s;ible Grandeur and Magni|ficence,
the Prince of <HI>Newburg</HI> appear'd
as well &s;atisfy'd as he could. My Lady
being the only Per&s;on who knew the true
Condition of his Heart, and the rea&s;on of
his di&s;covering a certain intermixture of
Sadne&s;s, whereof &s;he was the cau&s;e. The
Earl of <HI>A</HI>&mdash;<HI>n</HI> triumph'd both over his
Rival and the incon&s;tant <HI>Emilia,</HI> and
ta&s;ted all the Sweets and Plea&s;ures of a
happy Reconciliation; and after his unhap|pine&s;s,
wanted nothing now to compleat
his good Fortune but the Ab&s;ence of the
Prince of <HI>Newburg;</HI> neither was it long
before he &s;aw his wi&s;hes accompli&s;h'd
that way as well as in other re&s;pects.
The Prince, having taken leave of the
King, departed, without bidding farewel
to my Lady. However, he went fir&s;t
to <HI>Oxford,</HI> to take a view of that fa|mous
Univer&s;ity. He was receiv'd there
with extraordinary marks of Honour, and
with the &s;ame Ceremonies the Prince of
<HI>Tu&s;cany</HI> had there before; he was creat|ed
Doctor of Law, and pre&s;ented with a
Book full of curious Pieces in Miniature,
containing the Hi&s;tory of that Univer&s;ity.
As he was looking upon the&s;e Pictures,
he e&s;py'd one among the re&s;t which he
thought had a great re&s;emblance to my
Lady&mdash;, &s;o that upon comparing
them, he could gue&s;s no otherwi&s;e than
<PB N="518" REF="381">
that it was a Copy of her. This made
him break out into Sighs, and to com|plain
of his Misfortune, of &s;eeing the
Idea of a Per&s;on which he intended to
bani&s;h for ever from his Mind, reviv'd there
afre&s;h: He &s;hut the Book, put up the
Picture, and leaving <HI>England,</HI> &s;ought
for the remedy of his Love in another
place.</P>
<P>Give me leave, dear Cou&s;in, to &s;top
here; if I find the&s;e <HI>Memoirs</HI> to prove
acceptable to you, I will oblige you with
the Conclu&s;ion of tho&s;e Adventures
whereof, as yet, you have learn'd only
the Beginning. In tho&s;e you will be en|tertain'd
with more &s;erious Matters; tho'
what you have read hitherto, is intermix'd
with &s;ome Tragical Scenes; but I am

<HEAD>LETTER I.</HEAD>
<P>I Am going to fatigue my&s;elf with a
long Letter to you, Madam, in
hopes of entertaining you for an
Hour. I wi&s;h I may not be di&s;appointed,
and in giving my&s;elf Pain, afford your
Lady&s;hip no Plea&s;ure. The truth or pro|bability
I leave to your Cen&s;ure: I have
nothing to offer again&s;t either, but a Wo|man's
Malice, which, when aninated by
Revenge, is generally powerful enough
to make her blacken the mo&s;t Innocent.</P>
<P>The little Intere&s;t I have in the World
mu&s;t always be at the devotion of the
fair Sex; and it has been my good For|tune
&s;ometimes to render 'em Services.
A young Lady, who has it in her power
of commanding me as &s;he plea&s;es, not
long &s;ince recommended to me an Affair
of an elderly Gentlewoman's, who had
been a Favourite (in a late Reign) of the
then She-Favourite, but has &s;ince been aban|don'd
by her, (whether grown out of u&s;e or
for &s;ome other rea&s;on) Di&s;gu&s;t and Neg|lect
has &s;ucceeded her Care and Kindne&s;s;
nor could all her former &s;ecret Services
oblige her to remember her as &s;he ought,
tho' in an Occa&s;ion where it was to do
<PB N="522" REF="384">
her&s;elf no Hurt: She ungratefully refus'd
to u&s;e her Intere&s;t to the Lord Keeper in
a Cau&s;e &s;he had depending, (where I had
the opportunity of &s;erving h$r) as &s;he
might ea&s;ily have done, without any Pre|judice
to her&s;elf. This &s;o tran&s;ported the
old Lady, (with Anger and Re&s;entment)
that I think there is nothing &s;he would
not attempt for her Revenge. She told
me in her Rage a thou&s;and dangerous Se|crets
again&s;t my Lady&mdash;; pre|tended
Gratitude to me, &s;et her upon
paying my Score at her co&s;t. One part of
her Entertainment I here pre&s;ent your La|dy&s;hip.
But before you imagine her the
Speaker, allow me to &s;ay &s;omething by
way of Introduction.</P>
<P>You mu&s;t remember, Madam, that
&s;ome Years &s;ince, one Mr. <HI>W</HI>&mdash;<HI>l</HI>&mdash;<HI>n,</HI> (who
was known about the Town by the Name
of Beau <HI>W</HI>&mdash;<HI>l</HI>&mdash;<HI>n</HI>) from very mean Cir|cum&s;tances
and an ob&s;cure Condition, &s;et
up an Equipage, and made a Figure be|yond
many of the Nobility. After bla|zing
&s;ome few Years, (I can't exactly tell
how long) he was kill'd by one Mr. L.
going to fight a Duel with him; the re|port
ran, that L. murder'd him before he
could draw his Sword: Nor could it ever
be di&s;cover'd, either before or &s;ince his
death, who it was that had &s;upported
him in all that Grandeur. Mo&s;t certain
it is, that being a younger Brother, his
Friends had procur'd him a Colours, and
$word$ that Po&s;t he was &s;ent to &s;erve in <HI>Flan|ders;</HI>
<PB N="523" REF="385">
where he had not long continu'd,
but he was broke, as &s;ome report, for
Cowardice. But be it as it would, he
might well &s;ay with <HI>Themi&s;tocles, That
he had been lo&s;t if he had not been lo&s;t:</HI>
For &s;uch were his Nece&s;&s;ities, that a then
Colonel (but &s;ince, by the death of his
Father, a Baronet) lent (but as he thought
gave) him forty Shillings to &s;erve him in
his Pa&s;&s;age back for <HI>England.</HI> Here,
within a &s;mall time, he appear'd the
brighte&s;t Star in the Hemi&s;phere: His
Coaches, Saddle, Hunting, Race Hor&s;es;
Equipage, Dre&s;s and Table, were the ad|miration
of the World, and continu'd &s;uch,
when they &s;aw him continue them, and that
they could not a&s;&s;ign any &s;upport to all
this Glory. He never play'd, or but incon&s;i|&s;iderably;
Entertain'd with Profu&s;ene&s;s
all who vi&s;ited him: Him&s;elf drank libe|rally;
but in all Hours, as well &s;ober as
otherwi&s;e, he kept a &s;trict guard upon his
Words; tho' &s;everal were either employ'd
by the Curio&s;ity of others, or their own,
to take him at his loo&s;er Moments, and
per&s;uade him to reveal his Secret. But
he &s;o inviolably pre&s;erv'd it, that even
their Gue&s;&s;es were but at random, and
without probability or foundation. He
was not known to be an admirer of La|dies;
for amid&s;t all his Diver&s;ions, we
(that way) hear no news of his Plea&s;ures;
tho' he might, doubtle&s;s, have had the
good Fortune to have plea&s;ed, his Per&s;on be|ing
no ways de&s;picable. What adds to our
<PB N="524" REF="386">
Surprize, is, That he appropriated none
of his Hours; he was at all times to be
found, and ever with &s;ome of his People;
&s;eemingly open in Conver&s;ation, free
from Spleen or Chagrin; in a word, he
had that &s;ettl'd Air, as if he were a&s;&s;ur'd
his good Fortune would for ever continue.
One of his Friends advis'd him to Pur|cha&s;e
whil&s;t he had Money. Mr. <HI>W</HI>&mdash;
thank'd him, and &s;aid, He did not forget
the future in the pre&s;ent, he was oblig'd
to him for his Coun&s;el, but whil&s;t he
liv'd it would be ever thus, for he was
always certain to be Ma&s;ter of &s;uch a
&s;um of Money. This more and more
confounded the World: For, if they
would &s;ay he deriv'd his good Fortune
from the Ladies, there was &s;carce any
rich enough to &s;upport him, neither did
he be&s;tow any of his Time unaccounted
for; and 'tis not to be believ'd that the
fair Sex, being &s;uch rigid Creditors in
Love, would not, at lea&s;t, expect U&s;e-fruit
for their Money, e&s;pecially for &s;uch
con&s;iderable Sums. Tho&s;e who pretend
to gue&s;s better, have recour&s;e to Chimi|&s;try,
(I mean &s;uch as have faith in the
<HI>Hermetick Phylo&s;ophy</HI>) and &s;aid he had
found <HI>The Grand Secret,</HI> and was Ma&s;ter
of that unvaluable <HI>Tran&s;muting Stone,</HI>
at lea&s;t of a Powder that had power to
make Gold of Silver. But whence &s;hould
he have this Di&s;covery? Who could be
found &s;o obliging to be&s;tow &s;uch a For|tune
upon an ob&s;cure Per&s;on, unac|quainted
<PB N="525" REF="387">
to the whole Set of Pretenders
in <HI>Tri&s;megi&s;tus</HI>'s Art? What <HI>Raymudus
Lullius</HI> would impart this darling Secret
to an U&s;ele&s;s, Illiterate, Unknown? Or
&s;ay it were be&s;tow'd upon him, when
did he find time for the Operation? Or
if he had, during his being private,
wrought &s;ufficient for his Life, why did
he not Purcha&s;e with it? Or what be|came
of that precious Metal? an incon|derable
Sum being all that could be found
after his death. This may al&s;o be urged
to tho&s;e who bla&s;ted his Reputation
with the report, that he mu&s;t once have
robb'd a <HI>Holland</HI> Mail of a con&s;idera|ble
quantity of rough Diamonds; tho'
another Per&s;on &s;uffer'd for it, and deny'd
the Fact to the la&s;t. Others would have
it, that the <HI>Jews</HI> kept him, (I don't find
they can tell for what) it being very un|likely
that a &s;ett of Men &s;hould agree to
maintain the Riots of an u&s;ele&s;s Per&s;on;
neither did he frequent their Conver&s;a|tion
in publick. And, as we have before
ob&s;erv'd, the grand Objection continues
&s;till in force, in that Mr. <HI>W</HI>&mdash;was
never wanting, nor had he any particular
known Confident; or if he had, they
have been rigorou&s;ly ju&s;t, not only to him,
but to his Memory. Thus is this great
Secret like to continue &s;uch; for neither
Time nor Chance, which are reported for
the certain Di&s;coverers of all Things,
have yet reveal'd it to us, unle&s;s by the
following Relation you will allow the
<PB N="526" REF="388">
Riddle to be at length expounded, which
you mu&s;t do me the favour to imagine
you hear a malicious Per&s;on making to
me. I do not promi&s;e to give it you ei|ther
in or all her Words, yet in her Cir|cum&s;tances
and in the gro&s;s 'tis thus.</P>
<P><HI>Forcing the Tears, (to make her Trea|chery
tolerated</HI>) Ungrateful Lady! <HI>cry'd
&s;he, her Handkerchief at her Eyes:</HI> But
'tis the Temper of the Great, they hate
whom they have tru&s;ted, and tho&s;e by whom
they have been much $$liged; nay &s;ooner
would they forgive and &s;erve a mortal
Enemy, being in nothing more perfect than
Ingratitude. Once I was belov'd, tru&s;ted
and favour'd, or I had not been a manager
of guilty Secrets. All the time of the late
King's Life I was indeed con&s;ider'd, but
'tis pa&s;t, and I am forgotten; but tran&s;|ported
with my Re&s;entments, I delay to
&s;hew you, that if I had been ba&s;e, 'twas
more than once in my power to ruin her,
this ungrateful Lady! this Per&s;on accom|pli&s;h'd
in Ingratitude!</P>
<P>After her Attendance was over in the
King's Clo&s;et, &s;he took me one Evening
to walk with her in the Gardens at&mdash;
The Sea&s;on was hot, and the Air refre&s;h|ing.
In one of the mo&s;t retired Walks,
we found there lying upon the Ground,
a Per&s;on whom we after knew to be one
Mr. <HI>W</HI>&mdash;, a Cadet of a Gentleman's
Family, but in his Circum&s;tances unfor|tunate;
his Po&s;ture was melancholy, his
Looks dejected, and &s;o buried in Thought,
<PB N="527" REF="389">
that he rais'd not his Eyes to us, tho'
my Lady (who is now) made a full
&s;top, and &s;taid &s;ome Moments to con&s;ider
him. She &s;aw &s;omething either in his Air
or Face, or both, that irre&s;i&s;tably charm'd
her: Tho' perhaps he ought not to be
reckon'd among&s;t tho&s;e Beauties that
&s;trike all tho&s;e who look on 'em with
love and wonder, yet he might very well
be &s;aid to be a pretty Man: However,
with Mr. <HI>Dryden,</HI> we may &s;ay;
<Q><L>The Cau&s;e of Love can never be a&s;&s;ign'd;</L>
<L>'Tis in no Face, but in the Lover's Mind.</L></Q>
Whether her amorous Star had then the
A&s;cendant, that &s;he could not re&s;i&s;t her
Fate, or willing her&s;elf to give in to the
Plea&s;ures of Love in an Amour of Secre|cy,
or any other cau&s;e, but we pa&s;s'd and
repa&s;s'd him &s;everal times (tying clo&s;e our
Hoods, and pulling 'em as much as could be
to hide our Faces) without rai&s;ing his Per&s;on
or Curio&s;ity; therefore leaving me at the
Garden Gate, with In&s;tructions, &s;he took
Coach for <HI>London,</HI> and bid me try to di&s;|cover
who he was. I went and &s;eated
my&s;elf &s;o near, that he could no longer
avoid turning his Looks towards me;
whereupon he aro&s;e, and &s;aluting me with
a Bow civil enough, walk'd away. I
got up and follow'd him, Keeping &s;o clo&s;e
that he could not but fancy I had a de|&s;ire
to &s;peak with him: But that &s;eem'd
none of his Concern. He was going as
<PB N="528" REF="390">
fa&s;t as he could to that Door which opens
into <HI>Hide Park,</HI> when I call'd, <HI>Stay, Sir,
have you no Curio&s;ity to hear what can be
&s;aid to you? None at all, Madam,</HI> he
an&s;wer'd, <HI>unle&s;s the Godde&s;s of Fortune
&s;hould call upon me to offer &s;ome of tho&s;e
Favours I very much &s;tand in need of.
Perhaps I am &s;he,</HI> reply'd I, <HI>for 'tis known
that blind Deity be&s;tows her Ble&s;&s;ings at
random, and therefore not always to the
mo&s;t de&s;erving. You &s;aw the Lady who not
long &s;ince parted with me; no Godde&s;s
could have &s;ent you &s;o invaluable a Pre&s;ent
as is her Heart. The News perhaps</HI> (an|&s;wer'd
my carele&s;s Gentleman) <HI>would not
be unplea&s;ing to tho&s;e who have any incli|nation
to Toys, but I &s;tand in need of more
&s;ub&s;tantial Favours; my broken Fortunes
are not fit for Ladies; this Night I mean
to pa&s;s in the neighbouring Park, to de|termin
with my&s;elf what to do: Death is
my Refuge, the manner of it is only the
debate: Tho' when the thing is once re|&s;olv'd
on, a Moment or two more of Pain
being the only difference, ought not to keep
us long in &s;u&s;pence; therefore, Madam,
you cannot but find me the mo&s;t improper
Per&s;on alive for yours or any other fair
Lady's Occa&s;ions.</HI> To conclude, upon my
pre&s;&s;ing and encouraging him, he told me,
he had been broke in <HI>Flanders,</HI> and was
undone, not only in his Fortunes, but
Reputation, which had been bla&s;ted by
Malice and Mi&s;take; and that being de|ny'd
Revenge upon his too powerful
<PB N="529" REF="391">
Enemies, he was determin'd to turn it
upon him&s;elf. I &s;aid all I could to di&s;|&s;uade
him from De&s;pair; told him his
better Angel had lately, in the Form of
my Friend, appear'd to him; that if he
would live but till to Morrow Night, I
would engage to ea&s;e him of part of his
Misfortunes. My Spark was no other|wi&s;e
out of conceit with Life, but be|cau&s;e
he had not the means of living in
it with Plea&s;ures, or rather Conveniency,
&s;o moderate was he before the affluence
of Fortune. I thought it improper to
leave him, le&s;t by means of any of the
Gardners he might di&s;cover us: So that
I told him, if he would but walk to the
Gravel-Walk in the <HI>Park,</HI> I would come
round and take him up in a Hackney-Coach,
and carry him to <HI>London.</HI> That
there might be no return for him that
way, I took care to &s;hut the Garden Door
after him. When I had got a Coach, I
went to look for my Soldier: I found
him at his Po&s;t upon Duty. I took him
up, and bad him have courage, for For|tune
had done more for him than he cou'd
have had the pre&s;umption to de&s;ire. He
put on a more plea&s;ing Air, and entertain|ing
me (till we came to <HI>London</HI>) with
Rallery upon our Adventure, pre&s;s'd me
clo&s;e to di&s;cover to him who we were.
I told him, 'twas <HI>Fairy</HI> Land, which when
ever reveal'd, would fly before him; but
charg'd him to attend the next Night at
Twelve (if it did not Rain, as there was
<PB N="530" REF="392">
then little probability of any) at the Rail
that goes into St. <HI>James</HI>'s <HI>Park,</HI> at the end
of the Walk by Madam <HI>Mazarines</HI> Lodgings.
He fail'd not his A&s;&s;ignation, nor we to
meet me. The cu&s;tom of the place per|mitting
Masks, the Moon &s;hone bright,
and the Centuries were civil. My Lady
was &s;o charm'd with her Lover, that till
two of the Clock &s;he did not think of re|tiring.
She had no interruption in her
Amour, but di&s;cours'd him &s;o much to
her Satisfaction, that at parting &s;he put
into his hands a Bill for Five hundred
Pounds upon Sir <HI>F</HI>&mdash;<HI>C</HI>&mdash;; then
ordring him to &s;tay with me for a quar|ter
of an Hour, &s;he &s;truck, un&s;een by him,
into Madam <HI>Mazarine</HI>'s, where her Chair
and People waited. The greatne&s;s of the
Pre&s;ent amaz'd him, he could &s;carce be|lieve
his own Eyes, nor that Moon which
lent him Light to read his good Fortune.
But I mu&s;t do him the ju&s;tice to &s;ay, that
he bore it hand&s;omly. <HI>You are, indeed,
Madam,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>the Godde&s;s you &s;poke
of, and 'tis but ju&s;t that at your Shrine I
offer part of what, by your means, I have
receiv'd.</HI> I told him, that the Lady who
had $o$$ow'd that upon him, took care to
$et Per&s;ons that &s;erv'd her &s;tand in no
need of dividing her Favours. We took
Coach at St. <HI>James</HI>'s Gate, and I &s;et him
home at his own Lodgings near <HI>Hippo|$i$o's,</HI>
for fear he &s;hould return and ask
what Ladies were at Madam <HI>Mazarine</HI>'s;
tho' ours was got home before me, but
<PB N="531" REF="393">
&s;o tran&s;ported, and &s;o in love, that I was
&s;urpriz'd who found no &s;uch Inclinations
in my&s;elf of admiration for the Per&s;on
that had charm'd her. How often did
&s;he embrace and ki&s;s me? I believe in
Imagination that 'twas Mr. <HI>W</HI>&mdash;. She
begg'd my Conduct and Secrecy in the
management of an Affair upon which her
Plea&s;ure and her Intere&s;t (two con&s;idera|ble
Points) depended. She &s;aid, &s;he was
re&s;olv'd to &s;hew what a Fortune it was
to be her Favourite; that &s;he intended to
abundantly exceed the Hopes I had given
him, and would be the very Godde&s;s of
Bounty to him. He had Principles and
Vertue, with a Soul de&s;erving the noble&s;t
Favours; that could he be but &s;ecret,
(which &s;he would not doubt) her Pride
&s;hould be, to rai&s;e his Fortunes equal to
his Merit. When I waited on her in the
Morning, her Thoughts were rather more
inflamed. She aro&s;e to her &s;trong Box,
and gave me a Bag of a thou&s;and Guineas,
with an Order upon the &s;ame Banker for
Five hundred more. So that laden with
Riches and In&s;tructions, I took a Chair to
the Piazza. Di&s;charging it there, I walk'd
to a Coach, which carry'd me to Mr.
<HI>W</HI>&mdash;'s Lodgings, who was not yet &s;tir|ring.
After a little waiting, I was intro|duc'd
to his Bed &s;ide. 'Twas then that I
could not chu&s;e but make &s;ome Reflexions
upon the Vi&s;icitudes of human Affairs.
The Chamber was two Fair of Stairs,
dark and dirty, the Furniture old and
<PB N="532" REF="394">
poor: <HI>Ri&s;e, Sir,</HI> &s;aid I to him, <HI>and meet
your good Genius; I am &s;ent as the God of
Riches was to</HI> Timon; <HI>ther's Fifteen hun|dred
Guineas thrown upon the Bed for your
Morning's welcom: 'Tis your Lady's Plea|&s;ure
that you &s;hould immediately put your|&s;elf
in a Condition fitting the Favourite of,
Love and hers. Take the hand&s;ome&s;t
Lodgings (till a Hou&s;e can be furni&s;h'd)
that the Town affords; form your Equipage
according to the nice&s;t, riche&s;t Fancy; be
every thing that's Great and Noble. To
tho&s;e that have Money all things may be
perform'd with expedition. She is impa|tient
till your Fortune &s;hines equal to the
opinion that is had of your Merit. Re&s;t
a&s;&s;ured that hers are no tran&s;itory Favours;
they are not for a day, but for ever. All
you have to perform, on your part, is to
re&s;erve your&s;elf entirely for her, and ne|ver,
by an indi&s;creet Curio&s;ity, endeavour
to di&s;cover her; perhaps Time and Expe|rience
may bring her to tru&s;t the mighty
Secret with you; till then, if you enquire,
and &s;ucceed in that Enquiry, you mu&s;t not
only lo&s;e her, but your life al&s;o. Beware,
le&s;t like the</HI> P&s;yche <HI>in</HI> Apuleius, <HI>you &s;eek
not to behold the dangerous Cupid. The&s;e
Lines are recommended for your Motto,
from Sir</HI> William Davenant:
<Q><L>Ask not Bodies (doom'd to die)</L>
<L>to what Abode they go,</L>

<L>It is not &s;afe to know.</L></Q>
<PB N="533" REF="395">
Amu&s;e the World, and let 'em in vain in|quire
whence you derive this Fortune. It
is not to be told; for in telling, the Prin|ciples
are de&s;troy'd, and you remove far
from you, Her, the Foundation upon which
you &s;tand. 'Twill al&s;o be her Ruin, and
the height of Ba&s;ene&s;s in you, to level that
by which you were rais'd. This and more
you Indi&s;cretion (if you are guilty of any)
will bring to pa&s;s. But becau&s;e we with
difficulty believe Ill of tho&s;e we re&s;olve to
favour, &s;he has not half my apprehen&s;ions
of your Indi&s;cretion, and therefore orders
you to come this Night at Twelve of the
Clock to the Two&mdash;Po&s;ts in the <HI>Pall-Mall.</HI>
Ask no Que&s;tions, nor will you need, for I
&s;hall take care to be there to introduce you.
But becau&s;e In&s;tructions may be then im|proper,
take 'em now: You will find my
Lady in Bed, there &s;hall be but one Light
in the Chamber, but do not (by it) endea|vour
to &s;ee her Face; be &s;atisfied that &s;he's
young, and by &s;ome thought the hand&s;ome&s;t.
Make u&s;e of your good Fortune. I &s;uppo&s;e
Sleep will not be your bu&s;ine&s;s. When the
Clock &s;trikes two, ri&s;e and be gon, a Chair
&s;hall wait to carry you home. Thus may
you be ble&s;s'd both with Riches and Beauty.
And for the continuation of both, that en|tirely
depends on your&s;elf; whil&s;t you plea&s;e
you &s;hall be the only Favourite. The&s;e
Experiments are too dangerous and ex|pen&s;ive
for repetition, neither will &s;he be
able, without difficulty, to &s;teal tho&s;e happy
Hours allotted you. I &s;uppo&s;e when you
<PB N="534" REF="396">
are together, you will take mea&s;ures for
future Favours. Farewel, and remember
to be, if po&s;&s;ible, (what is difficult in this
turn of Fortune) Di&s;creet.</P>
<P>Thus, for a long time, did our happy
Lovers ta&s;te uninterruptedly the Sweets of
Love. Mr. <HI>W</HI>&mdash;took a Hou&s;e and
furni&s;h'd it &s;plendidly, appearing to all
Eyes the wonder of his Time: My La|dy$s
Opportunities were few, which the
be$$er help'd to conceal the My&s;tery; her
Hours always late, &s;o that Mr. <HI>W</HI>&mdash;having
the Keys brought every Night into his
own Chamber, without acquainting any
of his Servants, he would ri&s;e and dre&s;s
him&s;elf, and go in or out unknown to any
of 'em, a Chair, by my directions, al|ways
waiting to carry him. Thus (when
the World would wonder that he never
ab&s;ented him&s;elf from publick Views) has
this great Secret pa&s;s'd. His Expences
were &s;o va&s;t, that, as the Town&punc; &s;aid,
none but a Queen could &s;upport, with|out
ruining her&s;elf; which confounded all
Penetration, and well de&s;erves to be &s;et
down as a principal Article in the account
of &s;ecret Service, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>One Night returning with me from the
Rendezvous, my Lady&mdash;told me,
&s;he was undone, for that Fool <HI>W</HI>&mdash;
would be knowing. She had in vain
warn'd him again&s;t him&s;elf and that de|&s;troying
Devil, <HI>Curio&s;ity;</HI> he &s;eem'd re|&s;olv'd,
and had gone &s;o far as to tell her,
that if it co&s;t whatever was deare&s;t to
<PB N="535" REF="397">
him, he could not be ea&s;ie till &s;he had
given him that la&s;t proof of her Love.
Ah, my Dear, crys &s;he, what Things
the&s;e Men are? Whil&s;t we yet have any
Re&s;erve, we &s;till are importun'd; 'tis a
&s;upply to Conver&s;ation, which without a
Theam langui&s;hes: Love, however Om|nipotent
he be counted, abates much of
his Divinity when he comes to full En|joyment.
I mu&s;t either &s;ee this Creature
no more, or re&s;olve to di&s;clo&s;e my&s;elf. I
cannot wi&s;ely do the latter; for <HI>W</HI>&mdash;
&s;eems to be too weak a Ve&s;&s;el to tru&s;t my
Secret to; the Fumes of his good For|tune
has turn'd his Brain. Is he not &s;a|tisfied
that I love him more than I ought,
without I love him as much as I can?
Ah, this might have &s;ucceeded when Love
was young, and De&s;ire &s;tronger; whil&s;t
my Pa&s;&s;ion had yet the glo&s;s of Novelty;
but I &s;ee him now with the Eyes of Cu|&s;tom;
I have taken lei&s;ure to view him
with Con&s;ideration; he is undone by it;
for his Defects balances his Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions
and he, at lea&s;t, wants as many Vertues
as he enjoys. Nothing can be more di&s;|agreeable
than Importunity: I am tir'd
by it; my &s;ofter Moments are fatigu'd
with it. What opinion can a Per&s;on have
of our Under&s;tanding, when we yield that
to impertinent Solicitations, which we
have refus'd to Rea&s;on? Were I but &s;e|cure
that he would never come to the
knowledge of who I am, I could be well
contented to let the Affair end here; and
<PB N="536" REF="398">
would take care (for the Dignity of my
former Pa&s;&s;ion) to &s;ee him &s;o well pro|vided
for, that he might end his Days
with Splendor. More ju&s;t in this than
Fortune, (that fickle Godde&s;s) who makes
her Sport out of the Ruins of her Favou|rites,
and rejoices as much at the Cala|mity
of tho&s;e &s;he abandons, as ever &s;he
did at the Pro&s;perity of whom &s;he rai&s;es.
That I have not hitherto thought fit to
be&s;tow &s;upernumerary Sums of Money
for him to purcha&s;e any great E&s;tate with,
was becau&s;e he &s;hould have a more im|mediate
Dependance upon my Bounty:
Neither did I refrain his natural Inclina|tions
to Expence, becau&s;e that manner of
living more refin'd his Conver&s;ation, and
brought him &s;o much nearer to my Ta&s;te.
But now that the matter is otherwi&s;e,
you &s;hall meet him the next time in my
place, and give him what Advice I think
nece&s;&s;ary for both our &s;akes.</P>
<P><HI>I went accordingly, he took me for his
Lady, tho' in&s;tead of being in Bed, I &s;at
within the Curtains upon the Bed &s;ide;
after &s;ome little &s;ilence,</HI> Madam, (<HI>&s;aid he</HI>)
Are you come with more favourable Inclina|tions
to your Slave? or are you re&s;olv'd to
per&s;evere in your cruel denial? Better by
much to refu&s;e all, than grant by halves.
How can I whi&s;per to my Heart that I'm be|lov'd,
when treated with &s;uch Re&s;erve? Is
not the &s;ight of the Per&s;on enjoy'd, half the
Plea&s;ure? When I have you in my Arms,
know I what Ideas to fill my Mind with?
'Tis true your Wi$ and Conver&s;ation have
<PB N="537" REF="399">
a thou&s;and Charms, but where the lovely
Face is wanting, Enjoyment mu&s;t be Im|perfect.
Where is that noble Confidence
which ought to &s;natch hence the&s;e forbid|ing
Re&s;erves to the Per&s;on loving and be|ing
beloved? My Happine&s;s is &s;o imper|fect,
than I know not how, properly, it can
be call'd &s;uch; if I am to be undone by the
Sin of Knowledge, 'twas the lo&s;s of <HI>Para|di&s;e,</HI>
and mu&s;t be mine. Whether pu&s;h'd on
by my evil Genius, or &s;ome more irre&s;i&s;table
unaccountable Power, I am re&s;olv'd this
Night &s;hall end my Pain; (if you do not
think fit your&s;elf to oblige me with the di&s;co|very)
thus (cla&s;ping your lovely Body in my
Arms) will I expect the Morning, Day will
confe&s;s the Charmer; but if your Face hap|pen

his Favour. See, Madam, if I had
any occa&s;ion to be obliged to her, or you,
for the knowledge of&mdash;'Tis &s;ome time
&s;ince I had the good Luck to di&s;cover her;
but I'm per&s;uaded, had I ever been where
&s;he was, In&s;tinct mu&s;t have done it. Our
Coaches once met in <HI>Hide Park,</HI> &s;he was
then &s;peaking as we pa&s;s'd, and the Tone
and Mode of her Voice are too particular
to be conce$l'd&punc; be&s;ides, her Hand$ng loved
<PB N="539" REF="401">
re&s;ted upon the Window, and &s;he had upon
her Finger that large Diamond Ring, which,
for its particular Beauty, &s;he was pleas'd
to accept and wear as my Pre&s;ent; my
Heart confe&s;s'd the Charmer, and flew
after her Chariot Wheels. Let her but re|collect
how long &s;ince that happen'd, and
from thence a&s;&s;ure her&s;elf of my Di&s;creti|on,
and that &s;he has no occa&s;ion to di&s;tru&s;t
her mo&s;t faithful Slave. As for you,
Madam, I remember well, my Life was to
be the price of this important Secret; if
you plea&s;e, 'tis yours to take, tho' Chance
made the forfeit, I can't well fear &s;uch
fair Enemies: I therefore, with my Knees
to the Ground, beg of you to intercede for
(and with) me to my Godde&s;s, that &s;he may
permit me to &s;erve her out of Love, as be|fore
out of Gratitude. My Ardours have
been much redoubled, &s;ince touch'd with
that noble Pa&s;&s;ion my Tran&s;ports have
had a more exalted Motive; for to a Heart
like mine, Intere&s;t can never act like Love.
You have Power to do all things with her;
make her ea&s;y under this Di&s;covery. What
I pretend to from hence, is, but a greater
freedom in the Enjoyment of her my Soul
is fond of, that all con&s;traint may vani&s;h,
I may &s;ee her Face, her Air and Shape, her
Motions, and every other Grace, &s;ome|times
Eat with her; (no remote Plea&s;ure
in Love) and in &s;hort, make it appear that
I can value and adore her as I ought. Can
I be properly &s;aid to have a Pa&s;&s;ion for her
whil&s;t &s;he was unknown? 'Tis only then
<PB N="540" REF="402">
&s;ince &s;he was $word$ to we, that mine
$word$ be call'd &s;uch, from thence it begins
its Aet$, and &s;hall continue to the end of
$word$ Life. If (as all agree) the noble&s;t
Plea&s;ure be in Plea&s;ing, my Prince&s;s mu&s;t
have wanted that Plea&s;ure, &s;ince I could
not, with good Sen&s;e, pretend to love wh$$ I
did not know; &s;he might, for what I could
tell, be old, or very ugly. 'Tis true, I
was graceful to my Benefactre&s;s no more&mdash;
But there are other Tran&s;ports due to Love,
not to be imitated, and impo&s;&s;ible to be con|ceal'd.
Will &s;he not have rea&s;on to be better
&s;atisfy'd with me, when my Heart, fill'd
with her fair Image, has involuentary Fond|ne&s;s?
when all my Tran&s;ports are excited
by her Beauty, and that I con&s;ider nothing
in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of her, but her own Charms?
<HI>Here he left &s;peaking, and me in an ir|recoverable
Amazement. I ro&s;e and ask'd
his leave to retire, for what had newly
happen'd was &s;o unfor&s;een, that I had
no Commi&s;&s;ion to treat upon it, but the
next Night, if he pleas'd, (to be in the
&s;ame place) I might wait upon him with
&s;uch Commands as might decide his De|&s;tiny.</HI></P>
<P>Nor you, nor any living Soul can gue&s;s
the Lady's Grief and Rage; &s;he wept,

<HI>Banditty,</HI> my whole E&s;tate for Revenge.
What do I &s;ay, for Revenge? for Secu|rity:
I can never be &s;afe whil&s;t &s;uch a
dangerous Secret is lodg'd in &s;o loo&s;e a
Brea&s;t. What &s;hall I do? Di&s;&s;imulation
does but increa&s;e my Torment; but till I
find an opportunity to &s;ecurely puni&s;h, it
mu&s;t be &s;o&mdash;Go to him, and tell him,
he may thank him&s;elf for &s;eeing me no
more. I had &s;et it down for a Rule,
never after this di&s;covery to conver&s;e
with him, whenever he &s;hould prefer
Vanity to me; but if he betrays me, he
&s;hall die, like <HI>Alexander.</HI> I mean with my
own Hands to ta&s;te the Sweets of Mur|der
and Revenge. Were I to meet with
him in the King's Clo&s;et, on &s;uch an
Extand, it &s;hould be thus. But if his
Di&s;covery be made to others, I have
Money, and Rage has Indu&s;try, to find
out needy Villains to di&s;patch the Tray|tor.
But if he prove a Man of Honour,
and conceal me, he &s;hall &s;till live and
flouri&s;h, tho' I no more conver&s;e with
<PB N="542" REF="404">
him; if in publick Places he &s;hould meet
me, (tho' if he be wi&s;e he will avoid
'em) bid him beware, le&s;t he ca&s;t a glance
of acquainted Love; I forbid a Smile, a
Bow, the lea&s;t &s;hadow of what has been;
nay, if the Secret be blown abroad, or but
whi&s;per'd, he dies for it, &s;ince it can only
come from him (thee I am well a&s;&s;ured
on). Is not the whole Nation upon En|quiry
whence he derives his Fortune?
Should they but think he knew me,
'twere all unravel'd; for who but the
Queen and me could &s;upport a Favourite
at &s;uch a &s;hining height? 'Twill, ay
'twill be too ea&s;ily believ'd. But if he be
Di&s;creet, and engage him&s;elf in no A|mour,
(not that I value the conque&s;t of
&s;uch a ta$dry vain glorious Heart, or can
be jealous of what I think fit no longer
to po&s;&s;e&s;s) but the Creature on whom he
be&s;tows it may exact my Secret) my
Bounty &s;hall know no other Period but
his Life; care &s;hall be taken to &s;upply
him &s;ucce&s;&s;ively with Bills of <HI>Exchange,</HI>
If he be wi&s;e, he'll go out of <HI>England,</HI> or
retire into the Country; not that I
exact either from him, but as to the re&s;t,
his choice won't &s;ure be difficult to make
between Poverty and Wealth, Death and
Life.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>W</HI>&mdash;was forc'd (when he &s;aw
he cou'd get no better) to agree to the&s;e
Conditions. My Lady, tho' &s;he con&s;tant|ly
&s;upply'd him, as before, yet wou'd
never again by any means be brought to
<PB N="543" REF="405">
&s;ee him. What I have hitherto related is
matter of fact, and from the Original;
what follows, is circum&s;tantial only, but
enough to blacken her with the &s;u&s;picion
of the mon&s;trous cruele&s;t of Actions.
Poor Mr. <HI>W</HI>&mdash;, thou &s;urely de&s;erv'&s;t
better U&s;age; 'twas her plea&s;ure to rai&s;e
him, he could not &s;eek it, 'twas the work
of her own Hands, he kept her Secret re|ligiou&s;ly,
denying him&s;elf any conver&s;e
with Ladies, le&s;t he &s;hould give her oc|ca&s;ion
of complaint again&s;t him. His
Vanity indeed &s;till kept him Company;
for whereas a wi&s;e Man might ea&s;ily
have gue&s;s'd, that a Fool only cou'd be
content to maintain (for always) &s;uch an
unprofitable Expence, he &s;hou'd therefore
have retrench'd his, and have con&s;ider'd
of &s;ome &s;olid E&s;tabli&s;hment in the World;
but he &s;till had &s;ome weak ray of Hope,
that his Per&s;everance and Obedience wou'd
allay her Pa&s;&s;ion of Anger, and re&s;tore
him to her Favour again. But alas! 'twas
but ill grounded, for there had pa&s;s'd too
much Time, and he might well conclude
&s;he lov'd him not, when &s;he cou'd be
contented to live &s;o long without what
&s;he lov'd. In &s;hort, my&s;elf thought him
de&s;pi&s;ed and forgotten, his Name being
but rarely mention'd, and that only when
her Bounty was concern'd.</P>
<P>I imagin'd one Night that &s;he had
pick'd up a new Favourite, but where I
cou'd not tell; my Orders were to go to
the &s;hort Piazza, and take up a Gentle|man
<PB N="544" REF="406">
I &s;hould find walking there, (and who
wou'd come to the Coach) his Gloves
hanging out of his Coat Pocket. This
Spark I was to introduce by the <HI>Park</HI>
Door up the back Stairs into the Dre&s;&s;ing
Room. She pre&s;s'd my Hand, begging
me to retire, and to take care &s;he was
not overheard by any of her own People.
Her faithful Centinel obey'd; and after a
Conference of two Hours, I heard her go
into the Bed-Chamber with him, open
her &s;trong Box, and in a voice louder than
before, (for &s;he &s;eem'd for that moment
to have forgot I was her Neighbour) &s;aid
to him, <HI>Take this, and your Work done
depend upon another Thou&s;and, and my
Favour for ever.</HI> Then I was call'd, and
order'd to reconduct him to the place I
took him up at. I wou'd have enter'd
into &s;ome Di&s;cour&s;e with him in the
Coach, but he was upon the Re&s;erve, and
methought &s;omething abrupt in his De|parture.
This was a Secret which I was
not to be let into. The Wretch was young,
well dre&s;s'd, and hand&s;om enough, and it
&s;eem'd to me, that he was going to &s;uc|ceed
Mr. <HI>W</HI>&mdash;in the good Fortune of
my Lady&mdash;'<HI>s</HI> Favour; but I began to
change my Mind when I &s;aw him no more,
nor ever heard her mention him. My
gue&s;s was, that he had not pleas'd her,
and was only a Mu&s;hroom Favourite of a
Night.</P>
<P>Not long after, the News &s;urpriz'd
and reach'd me of poor Mr. <HI>W</HI>&mdash;'s be|ing
<PB N="545" REF="407">
kill'd upon the Place appointed by
him to fight a Duel with Mr.&mdash;. A
Name I had never known; the Quarrel
an incon&s;iderable Pretence about Mr. <HI>W.</HI>'s
Si&s;ter. I, all innocent of Revenge, ran
to acquaint my Lady&mdash;with it. Nor
did I well know what temper her Soul
might be in, and whether 'twere be&s;t con|dole
or congratulate her. She receiv'd
$he News with an Air &s;o unmov'd, that
I could not make any judgment of her
Thoughts. After &s;ome &s;ilence, &s;he cry'd
out, <HI>Poor vain glorious</HI> W&mdash;! <HI>And
is it true that thou art dead? I have kept
my Word with thee; my Bounty has no
other period but thy Life.</HI> Thus indiffe|rently
did &s;he take the death of one whom
&s;he with &s;uch an eagerne&s;s of Pa&s;&s;ion had
loved, &s;uch a magnificence of Favour.
Now did the Town redouble its Curio&s;i|ty,
imagining to have it gratify'd by
Mr. <HI>W</HI>&mdash;'s Papers; and that the long
hid Secret would be di&s;cover'd. But they
were as &s;ilent as his Grave, and as I &s;hould
ever have been, had I not been u&s;ed after
&s;o cruel and unpre&s;idented a manner.</P>
<P>When the Gentleman's Tryal came on
who had kill'd Mr. <HI>W</HI>&mdash;, my Curio|&s;ity
carried me to hear it, becau&s;e I had
been &s;o well acquainted with the deceas'd,
I did not mention my de&s;ign to my La|dy
&mdash;, or &s;he would, doubtle&s;s, have
prevented me. My Surprize was inex|pre&s;&s;ible,
when I &s;aw that the Gentleman
brought to the Bar was the &s;ame who I told
<PB N="546" REF="408">
you I had once introduc'd <HI>Incongnito</HI> to my
Lady&mdash;I almo&s;t imagin'd my&s;elf a
remote Acce&s;&s;ary; and &s;hudring with
dread and guilt, my Knees knock'd to|gether,
my No&s;e gu&s;h'd out violently
with Blood, or I had &s;ounded upon the
place. His Indirement beginning to be
read, I found my&s;elf unable to hear it;
therefore way was made for me, with
much difficulty, and I recover'd (half
dead) the Coach that waited for me.
Whil&s;t they were carrying me home, I
reflected on what a Per&s;on I had to deal
with, and &s;aw that if I had any value for
my Life, I mu&s;t not let her know the di&s;co|very
I had made; for &s;uch a dangerous
Secret to one &s;teep'd in Blood, would not
have been long &s;uffer'd to &s;leep in my
Brea&s;t. Therefore I mention'd nothing of
my Su&s;picion; nor knows &s;he to this day
that I was at the Tryal, or knew Mr.&mdash;was
the &s;ame Per&s;on that had had a pri|vate
Audience of her Lady&s;hip. Nothing
could have been manag'd with more ad|dre&s;s;
for I'm &s;till ignorant how &s;he came
acquainted with him, and of the means &s;he
found of procuring a Per&s;on &s;o fit for her
bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>'Tis needle&s;s to repeat to you how the
Tryal pa&s;s'd: Mr. <HI>L</HI>&mdash;was condemn'd,
and all Endeavours u&s;ed to get his Par|don.
But the King was always inexora|ble
upon the account of Murder. My
Lady never &s;eem'd to appear in it, and
therefore pitch'd upon a method that as
<PB N="547" REF="409">
well &s;erv'd her ends. Doubtle&s;s, her Re|mor&s;e
would not have been great &s;hould
the Criminal have &s;uffer'd, could there
have been any &s;ecurity of his per&s;i&s;ting to
the la&s;t in &s;ecrecy and &s;ilence: But the
Gallows is a general and dangerous Con|fe&s;&s;ional;
and had he come to that, what
might he not have di&s;cover'd? How ex|claim'd
again&s;t the Ingratitude and Trea|chery
of tho&s;e who &s;et him to work? It
is to be imagin'd he had not engag'd him|&s;elf
without an a&s;&s;urance either of Pardon,
or an Equivalent to it. All the World
knows how miraculou&s;ly he e&s;cap'd out
of Pri&s;on. I &s;ay, miraculou&s;ly! For no|thing
but the force of Gold could have
prevail'd over his inflexible Irons. His
arrival in the <HI>Low-Countries</HI> and continu'd
Expences, his appearance like a Man of
Quality and E&s;tate, tho' 'twas known that
he had not the value of a Groat to his
own, and lived, before that fatal Duel,
upon the Favours his good Fortune pro|cur'd
him from the Ladies. I find &s;he can
either keep her Word with him, or he has
been wi&s;e enough to &s;ecure a Sum &s;uffi|cient
to arm him again&s;t Ingratitude.
With me 'tis not &s;o well; Affairs have
chang'd faces; the King is dead, &s;he no
longer fears him; and concerning not her
&s;elf for the di&s;cretional part, leaves me
at liberty to &s;ay what I plea&s;e, after the
thou&s;and Prote&s;tations &s;he has a thou&s;and
times made me, &s;he would never el&s;e dare
to abandon me as &s;he has done.</P>
<P><PB N="548" REF="410">
Thus, Madam, in as &s;uccinct a manner
as the Story would permit, have I told your
Lady&s;hip what the good old Gentlewoman
was three Hours in relating. I &s;ub&s;cribe
implicitly to your Opinion as to the truth
of it, and de&s;ire in the next that you will
favour me with the knowledge of it.
'Tis certain Mr. <HI>W</HI>&mdash;'s Supply was
wonderful; and if this was not the real;
'tis at lea&s;t a probable way.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER II.</HEAD>
<P>AT length, my dear Si&s;ter, (all tran|&s;ported
with a fond Bridegroom's
Joy) I may with a&s;&s;urance tell you, that
I'm upon the point of being entirely ble&s;t;
my charming Mi&s;tre&s;s has this Night
con&s;ented, her Father has con&s;ented, to
my unutterable Happine&s;s; to Morrow
makes me Ma&s;ter of my De&s;ites; the
Thought hurries me beyond my&s;elf: I
could &s;ee my very Enemies with Joy;
therefore to expect any thing but Rap|ture,
to expect plain Sen&s;e from me at
this time, is thinking below the Dignity
of my Pa&s;&s;ion: Nor wants it any height|ning,
by looking back upon the dreadful
<PB N="549" REF="411">
Precipice I've pa&s;t, the Difficulties I have
&s;truggl'd with, the almo&s;t Impo&s;&s;ibilities
that I have vanqui&s;h'd, the Rack of Mind,
the Ob&s;tacles of a rich and powerful Ri|val,
and con&s;equently the Re&s;erve of Pa|rents.
Love alone was for me; my
charming Mi&s;tre&s;s was all kind and con|&s;tand;
&s;he help'd me to &s;upport my ar|dent
Longings; for what can be more
exqui&s;ite than delay'd Enjoyment? when
two Hearts, mutually burning, mutually
langui&s;hing for what Love and Nature
boldly dictates, finds &s;o many Bars to
cro&s;s their Happine&s;s?</P>
<P>Do not you (my dear Si&s;ter) join with
the &s;ordid World, in blaming me for pre|ferring
Merit to Riches; I look'd beyond
it for my Happine&s;s. The Hinge of In|rere&s;t,
upon which at pre&s;ent the whole
Nation turns in their Marriages, makes
&s;o many of 'em unfortunate. 'Tis true,
I could have had a Wife with an ample
Fortune; but perhaps to me &s;canty in
Charms, in that Harmony of Minds from
which only Happine&s;s ari&s;es. She whom
I &s;hall pre&s;ent you for a Si&s;ter, has a $en|derne&s;s
for me beyond all other value.
To plea&s;e her, you mu&s;t begin by me;
&s;hould I frown, or be out of temper, her
whole Frame would be in di&s;order: Then
&s;he has a Voice and Words that can cure
De&s;pair, can charm di&s;plea&s;ing Melan|choly.
Oh! 'tis impo&s;&s;ible to hear her
Speak, and know a Pain. How true,
how noble is her Soul! How eminent her
<PB N="550" REF="412">
Wit! Her Sen&s;e, how &s;olid! How &s;oft,
how &s;weet her Love! I figure my&s;elf
returning home fatigu'd with Bu&s;ine&s;s,
where I meet, with open Arms, this dear,
this faithful Wife, who knows how to
charm my Cates, how to time her Kind|ne&s;s,
and even to wait for mine, and
without Impatience to &s;tay till tho&s;e Sal|lies
of ill temper be blown over which
Di&s;appointment have perhaps occa&s;ion'd.
No Hours can e'er be tedious in her Com|pany.
This I &s;peak not like a Lover,
the whole World, that know her, will
eccho this eternal Truth. When you've
&s;earch'd the round of Conver&s;ation abroad,
to be ju&s;tly plea&s;ed you mu&s;t return to
her; for in this point all agree is united
whatever can be plea&s;ing or in&s;tructive.
None ever yet went from her pall'd or
undelighted: I &s;peak of tho&s;e who have
Sen&s;e to make a true Judgment of Things,
and dwell longer on her Mind, into which
I have conducted you, that you may know
and value it. 'Tis upon that my &s;olid
Happine&s;s is fix'd, that unalterable Beau|ty,
which is known to flouri&s;h in its high|e&s;t
perfection, at an Age when but the
memory remains, or &s;carce that, of out|ward
Charms. I prepare you then, my
dear Si&s;ter, to be ravi&s;h'd with the Beau|ty
of hers, and believe &s;o well of your
Brother's Under&s;tanding, that he knows
how to choo&s;e for Happine&s;s. Cards,
publick Conver&s;ation, Mu&s;ick, the Play-Hou&s;e,
Vi&s;its, and the bu&s;ine&s;s of Vi&s;its&punc;
<PB N="551" REF="413">
Detraction and Ill-nature, are none of her
Diver&s;ions; I &s;hall be &s;ure to find her al|ways
emply'd, always at home, careful
of her Family, entertaining me when pre|&s;ent
either with reading, or her own more
plea&s;ing Conver&s;ation, or wi&s;hing for me
when ab&s;ent. Her Temper is like her
Nature, perfectly good, free from vain
Expences, my Intere&s;t her only pur&s;uit,
and all her De&s;ires regulated by that;
nay &s;he &s;o perfectly loves me, that I may
an&s;wer for her Soul, &s;he would choo&s;e
common Conveniencies with me, rather
than Place, Di&s;tinction, Title and Ob&s;er|vance
with another. Is there on Earth a
Type of our hereafter Happine&s;s or Mi|&s;ery?
'tis &s;urely in the married State.
What mu&s;t he expect, that choo&s;es only
for Intere&s;t, a Woman haughty of the Ad|vantages
&s;he brought you, &s;eeking to be
plea&s;ed rather than plea&s;e? And where
you take no other Con&s;ideration along
with you, 'tis impo&s;&s;ible to make one's
Duty one's delight. Mu&s;t I &s;ubmit my
Hours to the unea&s;ie jangling of an imper|tinent,
proud, &s;en&s;ele&s;s Woman, full of
Noi&s;e and Vanity? Mu&s;t I cla&s;p her to
my Bo&s;om, and pay the Rights of Love
with or without Inclination, or run the
hazard of blowing up her weak &s;u&s;picious
Mind with jealou&s;ie that her Duties are
be&s;tow'd upon another? Mu&s;t I, when I
want one Companion, take a Legion?
For &s;o many will be her Go&s;&s;ips; Tea
Tables and Chat, Detraction and Folly,
<PB N="552" REF="414">
which if but with a piece of Face I &s;hould
&s;eem to di&s;like, 'twere running the Gant|let
thro' all the round of Tongues where
&s;he vi&s;its, and of whom &s;he is vi&s;ited; to
&s;et the whole Herd upon me, and at me.
With &s;uch a Wife a &s;en&s;ible Man will be
&s;ure not to di&s;pute; his be&s;t way will be
to &s;uffer in &s;ilence; and as a proof of his
Wi&s;dom, admit her Impertinence to go|vern.
Then, if you &s;trike at Forms, or
pretend to re$rench any of tho&s;e vain Ex|pences,
of which &s;he finds &s;ufficient Pre&s;i|dents
among&s;t her &s;he Friends, as to Dre&s;s,
Entertainment, &s;tately Child-birth, and
her whole Artillery of Follies, 'twill
make her hate and wi&s;h you dead; for
the fir&s;t thing &s;uch a Woman thinks of
after &s;he's married, is how to become a
Widow. Oh, 'twere endle&s;s to reckon
you up all the Inconveniencies ari&s;ing
from Marriage made only upon the &s;core
of Intere&s;t. And wha$ are their Advan|tages?
what Enjoyments have you of 'em?
Do you eat, or drink, or &s;leep more for
being Richer? Are you not as happy with
plain clean Cloaths, as if you were every
night dre&s;s'd for the Drawing-Room? Ay,
but &s;ome fancy a plea&s;ure in hoarding
Money. To a Man &s;o weak, Rea&s;on will
be lo&s;t, and therefore I &s;hall not pretend
to argue with him. And as to our care of
Po&s;terity, I have &s;een hundreds more con|&s;iderable,
with ju&s;t enough to teach 'em
how to live, than others who&s;e Fathers
have left 'em great E&s;tates. Human Na|ture

loves Action; and, generally &s;peak|ing,
tho&s;e who have not Bu&s;ine&s;s to em|ploy
them&s;elves with, throw away their
Time in Folly. To tho&s;e who&s;e Natures
are idle and extravagant, Abundance does
but heighten their Misfortune, and make
'em the more eminently Vicious. But
how have I wander'd whence I fir&s;t &s;et
out? But 'tis, my dear Si&s;ter, with de&s;ign
to make you approve my Choice; tho'

Conver&s;ation have charm'd even you (all
lovely as you are) to an envy of my Hap|pine&s;s,
next to enjoying her my&s;elf. I'm
impatient to pre&s;ent her to your Arms. I
plea&s;e my&s;elf with thinking what a har|mony
of Mind will ari&s;e between you;
for in giving you her Character, &s;he has
but &s;at for yours; and were you not my
Si&s;ter, next my Mi&s;tre&s;s, I could of all
Womankind be only charm'd with you:
Shew me in Nature two &s;o fit for E&s;teem,

My endeavours, in &s;peaking to your Rea|&s;on,

<PB N="555" REF="417">
Life, can he be other than my Enemy,
who envies, denies or defers me from
the immediate enjoyment of that pro|mis'd
Happine&s;s? Who wou'd not boldly
plunge through a &s;hort unea&s;ie Pa&s;&s;age,
when on the other &s;ide he is &s;ure to find
the end of all his Wants, his Anxieties,
his Pains, his tormenting De&s;ires; and,
which is more than all, his end of Sinning?
Wou'd he, think you, on any terms, tho'
but for a Day, return from tho&s;e Joys,
tho' he was &s;ure to feel as much Plea&s;ure
as he did Pain in his departure? It is not
the lea&s;t of Sir&mdash;'s good Fortune, that
he dy'd unknowing the in&s;eparable di&s;|gu&s;ts
or di&s;quiets of Old Age, who&s;e very
Imaginations are frozen under the Snow
of &s;ixty Winters. Tho' perhaps this may
&s;eem to you a cau&s;e (however mi&s;taken)
for your greater Grief, when, looking
through the wrong end of the Gla&s;s, you
fancy him (by untimely Death) deprived
of many Enjoyments. And were I not on
&s;o &s;erious a &s;ubject, I wou'd &s;ay you
were in the right; &s;o far at lea&s;t, as his
Happine&s;s concern'd the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of &s;o
great a Good as your Lady&s;hip. But
(that excepted) there can be no other com|pari&s;on
than between finite and infinite;
hence it is that upon no terms can you
be &s;uppos'd to mourn for him. 'Tis your|&s;elf
then that you lament; and how un|worthy
is that Lamentation, to a Soul &s;o
rea&s;onable, &s;o capable of Philo&s;ophy,
nay Religion? The latter you entirely of|fend
<PB N="556" REF="418">
by repining, nay exclaiming again&s;t
the Almighty plea&s;ure of our great Crea|tour,
who in his Mercy has been pleas'd
to call one of his Creatures earlier than
Man's appointed Time, from temporary
Pains and Sin, to the incapacity of Sin,
and the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of eternal Plea&s;ures;
again&s;t Philo&s;ophy and Rea&s;on, when you
vainly torment your&s;elf for what is in it|&s;elf
irrecoverable, placing Good and Evil
in things outward, viciating the ta&s;te of
tho&s;e things you do or may po&s;&s;e&s;s, by
an unju&s;t Sorrow for that which you have
no longer a title or hopes of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing.</P>
<P>Thus, Madam, I wou'd pretend to re|move
your Grief, by &s;hewing you, that you
have no true occa&s;ion of it: For if, as I
have told you, it be Self love, and that
that is a Weakne&s;s unworthy of you, I
mu&s;t farther &s;hew, that that very Self-love
ought to ri&s;e in Arms again&s;t the
continuation of your Sorrow, &s;ince it not
only de&s;troys your Quiet, but Youth and
Beauty fly before it, and po&s;&s;ibly may
never return. For, how have the faire&s;t
Faces lo&s;t (by Grief and langui&s;hing Me|lancholy)
the Lillies and the Carnation
that made 'em lovely? A pallid hue &s;uc|ceeds
that Bloom irre&s;i&s;table, ince&s;tant
&s;calding Tears can furrow the &s;moothe&s;t
Cheeks, continual Sighs blow the preg|nant
Cherry from the envitinge&s;t Lips;
and when we wou'd &s;peak of Rea&s;on, Elo|quence,
Wit, or any other branch of
plea&s;ing Conver&s;ation; 'tis &s;o profe&s;s'd an
<PB N="557" REF="419">
Enemy to all in general, that none of 'em
ever pretends to appear where that Tyrant
Grief has once taken up its Re&s;idence.</P>
<P>Weigh well then, Madam, how ill a
Bargain you have made; how many Ex|cellences
you batter for a thing no one in
his Sen&s;es wou'd entertain; more than
enough is already paid to Cu&s;tom, and
the unju&s;t Opinion of the World. Re|a&s;&s;ume
your Courage, con&s;ult your Rea|&s;on,
throw hence your Sorrow, take to
your&s;elf that noble Fortitude which &s;o
well becomes a Genius exalted as your
Lady&s;hip's. Were it to the advantage of
the deceas'd (or that by it we cou'd recal
him to Life and you) my&s;elf wou'd club
a Tear with you, be a con&s;tant Mourner
at his Tomb, till our mingled Sorrows
had their de&s;ir'd Effect. But imagining

again&s;t their great <HI>Diana,</HI> and offended 'em
&s;o far, that they wou'd by no means con|&s;ent
to a Marriage within the Degrees
forbidden. This caus'd him to &s;hoot
him&s;elf, unable to live without the En|joyment
of his Mi&s;tre&s;s. The dreadful
Deed done, he yet liv'd a Fortnight. The
good natur'd P&mdash;l&mdash;tes relented, and al|low'd

a Di&s;pen&s;ation, tho' too late for
our dying Lover to profit by it. So that

Now, if it was once a Sin, it was

Sixty odd, my Lord&mdash;, being upon
a religious &s;train, and de&s;iring Canoniza|tion
hereafter (if Sufferings can make a
Saint). 'Tis &s;aid, that &s;he re&s;olv'd to
marry the two wor&s;t Husbands in <HI>England,</HI>
that &s;he might have her Mortifications
and Puni&s;hment in this Life.</P>
<P>What has been the young Lady's in|ducement
to this Marriage (unle&s;s Mor|tification)
is hard to &s;ay. My Lord has
long been look'd upon (however formerly
&s;ucce&s;sful) as a Piece out of u&s;e among&s;t
the Ladies. Surely &s;he wanted to be one
Step higher in the Temple of Honour. If
Death does not quickly &s;eparate them,
they fear that Accidents may; for I hear

&s;ide for Jealou&s;ie, Ill humour, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and a
&s;eparate Maintenance agreed on, in ca&s;e

<P>This Marriage reviving Pa&s;&s;ages of my
Lord's former Life, an airy youngi&s;h Wo|man
(who had had the plea&s;ure to out|live
her Reputation) told me, in Confi|dence,
That upon the death of his la&s;t
Lady it came into her head to try what
Charm there was in this old Peer, that
<PB N="566" REF="428">
&s;till, where he pleas'd, made him &s;ucce&s;s|ful.
She had a pretty-Strain in writing
of fooli&s;h Love Letters, and began a Cor|re&s;pondence
with him. He was &s;o vain
to believe a young Lady was fallen in love
with him; and an&s;wer'd her again with
as much Vanity and Fire, as if he had
reckon'd no more than Two and twenty.
They came to an A&s;&s;ignation. Our Heroin
is pretty, genteel and gay, but was &s;o ill
&s;atisfied with her Lover, that &s;he cry'd
out, he was all over Three&s;core: And
when his Marriage Articles were in treaty,
&s;he &s;ent a Letter to the Lady, to advi&s;e
her to in&s;i&s;t upon the Privilege of a Gal|lant,

I thank you for your Advice. 'Tis

time enough when I come to be a &s;tale

lo&s;ing my Reputation by the&s;e Freedoms;
but, Sir, you are mi&s;taken; for the only

have half a &s;core upon my hands at this

a &s;ight 'tis, to &s;ee this Beau cring and

my $$$owance is but &s;mall; I have new

forced to turn and twine 'em, that I may
not be known by them; fine Cloaths have
wonderful Charms with the Men; and
one had as good be ugly as ill dre&s;s'd.
But, Sir, if you plea&s;e, I will give you a

Doctor of Phy&s;ick that makes honourable
Addre&s;&s;es to me; but I think not that an

finer than a <HI>Covent-Garden</HI> Beau, and
more demure than my Chamber-Maid;
he courts me, not by <HI>Billet-douces,</HI> but by
Bills of Exchange, and Stock-Jobbing;
but I have no mind to venture my&s;elf on
his dangerous Bottom. So much for my
matrimonial Pretenders. I have another
&s;ort, who are for nothing but Love, and
abominate the <HI>Pagun</HI> Confinement of Wed|lock,
as a Device of Intere&s;t in the Prie&s;t,

to in&s;inuate the entire Mortality, under

him&s;elf. I have &s;een a &s;mall Treati&s;e,

&s;ince what can cea&s;e to be, tho' but for a
moment, may cea&s;e for ever. Our Second
Appearance (allowing the Doctor's No|tion)
may be more properly call'd a New
Creation, than a Re&s;urrection: Notwith|&s;tanding,
the Body being &s;till &s;ub&s;i&s;ting
under &s;everal Tran&s;mutations, as into
Worms, or a clod of Clay, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> the Soul be|ing
an immaterial Spirit, incapable of any
&s;uch Change, mu&s;t fly off and di&s;&s;olve into
Air, and certainly cea&s;e to be, &s;ince you
allot it no Repo&s;itory; and that however
the Body may ari&s;e the &s;ame, there mu&s;t
be a new Creation of the Soul, or Spirit,
to animare that Body; unle&s;s you'll allow
it can be likewi&s;e tran&s;muted and &s;ub&s;i&s;t,

<HEAD>LETTER XXIV.</HEAD>
<P>I U&s;ed to be pretty lucky in di&s;covering
Secrets, and I have now, Madam,
found one worthy your Lady&s;hip's Curio|&s;ity.
A young Woman, with whom I di|verted
my&s;elf, did me the favour to go
with me into the Country for a Week,
during the heat of the Sea&s;on: There
ought to be a ce&s;&s;ation of Plea&s;ure, as well
as Bu&s;ine&s;s, to make us the more eagerly to
return to our Bent. One Morning I left
my fair Lady in Bed; and ri&s;ing at Five
of the Clock, took a Book in my Pocket,
and re&s;olv'd to divert my&s;elf with walk|ing
farther than I could have done with
<PB N="585" REF="447">
my &s;oft Companion. The Place we were
at, was&mdash;, twelve Miles from <HI>Lon|don.</HI>
I cro&s;s'd over the Lanes and Fields,
pleas'd with the irregularity of my Walk,
for my de&s;ign was only Exerci&s;e and the
Air. I found my&s;elf, by Seven of the
Clock, wander'd far from the place
whence I &s;et out, and &s;ome di&s;tance from
any Road, but near a neat little Brick-Hou&s;e
built at the extremity of a Field.
I made up to it, with a de&s;ign to re&s;t
my&s;elf upon a Bench that was placed at
the Garden Gate, which had a Trilo
that gave the Pro&s;pect of the Country.
'Twas open, and I found the &s;atisfaction
of viewing a very pretty Place, wonder|fully
neat, and adorned with Pots and
Greens &s;ufficient to give me an opinion of
the Genius of the Per&s;on who was the
Owner. I &s;hut the Gate, becau&s;e I was
not willing to be &s;een by any from the
Hou&s;e, who would perhaps have reckon'd
me an Intruder, tho' I exceeded not the
liberty of the Bench: Where re&s;ting my|&s;elf,
I was going to continue my Diver|&s;ion
of Reading; but I had not been there
twenty Minutes, when I &s;ay, from the
other end of the Field, a Lady advancing
towards the Hou&s;e. She had on a white
Silver Stuff Night-Gown, hanging loo&s;e,
or lap'd about her, lin'd with a full Ro&s;e-colour
Sattin; a Wa&s;tcoat that, at the
Bo&s;om, &s;hew'd a quantity of fine <HI>Flanders</HI>
Lace, with a Shift and Cuffs of the &s;ame;
her Night Linen clean and fine as po&s;&s;ible,
<PB N="586" REF="448">
ty'd with Cherry and Silver Ribbons, and
over that a fine <HI>Dutch</HI> Straw-Hat, lin'd
with Green, mounted with a Carnation
Feather, and cock'd behind. Upon her
Arm &s;he had a little Basket, which held
a Book, her Netting, and &s;ome few O|range,
Lemon, Ja&s;&s;emin and Myrtle Sprigs,
which &s;he had (as I &s;uppo&s;e) gather'd
before &s;he went into the Field. Her Hat
being pull'd over her Eyes to skreen the
Sun, &s;he &s;aw me not: which I took the
advantage of; and before &s;he gain'd the
Bench, I &s;lip'd to the turning of the Gar|den
Wall, which was not ten Peces from
the place where I had &s;at, &s;he took the
Seat I had quitted, and, it being &s;hady,
pull'd off that di&s;obliging Hat which had
hinder'd me from &s;eeing the lovely Face.
After &s;h$ had re&s;ted a little while, &s;he
took the Greens out of the Basket, and
made a No&s;egay, which &s;he fix'd in her
Bo&s;om; and then &s;earching to the bottom
of her Basket, pull'd out a Paper which
I quickly perceiv'd (by looking over her
Shoulder) to be a Song &s;et to Notes,
which promis'd me &s;ome Mu&s;ick from my
lovely Charmer: And indeed I was not
deceiv'd, for in an inchanting Strain &s;he
&s;ung <HI>Ro&s;ie Bowers.</HI> I was &s;o bewitch'd
with her Air and Voice, that I dur&s;t hard|ly
breath for fear of interrupting her;
tho' I dy'd with impatience to have a full
view of her Face, which as yet I had not
&s;een; but I trembled le&s;t my appearance
might cau&s;e the lovely Vi&s;ion to vani&s;h.
<PB N="587" REF="449">
The Song was of a length &s;ufficient to
give me time to make many Reflexions,
however chain'd my Sen&s;es were to the
Mu&s;ick of her Voice. I &s;aw with won|der
a Lady of her Air and Dre&s;s in &s;o re|mote
a place; for I could not imagine
(the Garden excepted) that the Hou&s;e
promis'd any thing but bare Conveniences,
and not &s;uitable to the Dre&s;s of her who
&s;eem'd to be the &s;hining Mi&s;tre&s;s of it.
The Song ended, &s;he took out her Net|ting-work;
at which Diver&s;ion &s;he con|tinu'd
but a &s;mall time, when throwing it
back into her Basket, as who &s;hould &s;ay,
you are not for my purpo&s;e at this time,
I heard her &s;igh more than once, and in
no little romantick Tone, repeat the&s;e
Ver&s;es from <HI>Oroonoko</HI> (for I remembred to
have read 'em there):
<Q><L>This place, this &s;pot of Earth is more to me</L>
<L>Than the extended Plains of my great Father's King|dom.</L>
<L>Here we &s;hall reign in Joys, to Power unknown;</L>
<L>Your Love my Empire, and your Heart my Throne.</L></Q>
Then, as if in&s;pir'd by what &s;he had &s;aid,
(or the Thought that had occa&s;ion'd tho&s;e
Words) &s;he ro&s;e up all of a &s;udden, and
turn'd &s;o &s;hort upon me, that I had not
time to ab&s;cond far enough behind my
Wall, &s;he gave a great S$reek at the Sur|prize
of &s;eeing an unknown Per&s;on there,
and &s;hew'd &s;o much danger of Swooning,
that it gave even my Mode&s;ty a ju&s;t Ex|cu&s;e
to run and catch that lovely Body in
<PB N="588" REF="450">
my Arms to prevent its falling upon the
Gra&s;s. I may boldly confe&s;s to your La|dy&s;hip,
that in that moment I felt more
Delight than I imagin'd was in the power
of the whole Sex to give me. I could
not forbear pre&s;&s;ing her &s;lily to my Bo&s;om,
her Body yielding to my touches, being
only guarded with a loo&s;e Gown and a
Holland Wa&s;tcoat, (ju&s;t as if ri&s;en from
Bed) with one only Petticoat on, that
all the lovely Limbs and Shape were to
be di&s;cern'd, and the re&s;t imagin'd. But
long I could not enjoy the envied plea|&s;ure,
for readuring her&s;elf, &s;he gain'd the
Bench, and then in an obliging fa&s;hiona|ble
manner, ask'd my pardon for her Sur|prize.
But being &s;o little u&s;ed to Com|pany,
e&s;pecially Per&s;ons of my Appea|rance,
and at that early Hour, it might
(if any thing could) be an excu&s;e for the
Di&s;order &s;he had been in. Then continu|ing
her Di&s;cour&s;e, &s;he ask'd me, with a
charming Addre&s;s, if I pleas'd to &s;it and
repo&s;e my&s;elf, and tell her if I had any
Commands there, or bu&s;ine&s;s with Mr.
<HI>King,</HI> which &s;he imagin'd, becau&s;e that
was no place for chance Pa&s;&s;engers, like
me, her little Cottage being directly out
of any Road; and tho' it was her Hu&s;|band's
misfortune to be then at <HI>London,</HI>
&s;he would faithfully di&s;charge any Com|mi&s;&s;ion
to him. Whil&s;t &s;he was thus de|livering
her&s;elf, my whole Soul and Fa|culties
were charm'd by her; but Wonder
giving place to Memory, methought this
<PB N="589" REF="451">
lovely Unknown was no longer &s;o to me:
<HI>Good Heav'n!</HI> (cry'd I out) <HI>is it po&s;&s;ible
the charming Mrs.</HI> S&mdash;, <HI>who has been
dead to all the World for almo&s;t the&s;e three
Years, forgetful of her Youth, her Family,
her Charms and Fortune, can bury her&s;elf
in a place &s;o unworthy of her!</HI>&mdash;More
I could not &s;ay, but was forced to run to
the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the afflicted Beauty. She
did now in reality what before &s;he was
only like to do, and fell back on the Arm
of the Bench in a confirm'd Swoon. I
curs'd my indi&s;creet Di&s;covery, rav'd,
beg'd, intreated her to return to Life,
wept upon her lovely Face, pre&s;s'd mine
clo&s;e to her, did all, but in vain, that
was nece&s;&s;ary to recal her Sen&s;es. At
length, finding it to be no work of
mine, I had recour&s;e to the Garden-Gate,
and knock'd &s;o loud, that that a|lone
might have recall'd her. At length
a Gardner came to me, who&s;e a&s;&s;i&s;tance
I de&s;ir'd, to help me convey his Mi&s;tre&s;s
in, who was there in a fainting Fit; we
brought her between us into the Hou&s;e,
and carrying her into a Room upon the
ground-floor, we laid her upon a Day-bed.
Pre&s;ently a Gentlewoman and two under
Servants came to her a&s;&s;i&s;tance, one with
a Bottle of Harts-horn, and another with
fair Water; we threw &s;ome on her Face,
which, with the help of Spirits, recover'd
her; but her Memory did not &s;o immedi|a$ely
return. At length ca&s;ting her lovely
black Eyes upon me, they immediately
<PB N="590" REF="452">
fill'd with Tears, and in &s;o va&s;t a quanti|ty,
that they &s;eem'd like Fire in Water,
contending which &s;hou'd have the ma&s;tery;
&s;ilently upbraiding me for what I had di&s;|cover'd.
I mu&s;t confe&s;s, I was &s;o through|ly
enraged again&s;t my&s;elf, that had not
her People been about us, I believe I
&s;hou'd have fall'n upon my Sword before
her, to have aton'd that way for my Indi&s;|cretion.
That Scene of &s;ilence cou'd not
but give cau&s;e of Reflexion to all that
were pre&s;ent. Grief and Surprize were
painted to the life upon her Face; Re|mor&s;e
and De&s;pair upon mine; Wonder
and Re&s;pect upon the Servants, who &s;ee|ing
their Lady pretty well recover'd of
her Illne&s;s, left the Room to us, that
knew not how to improve the Opportuni|ty,
or where to begin the Di&s;cour&s;e;
Shame and Confu&s;ion had &s;eiz'd us both.
At length I thought it my duty to endea|vour
the rea&s;&s;uring of her Mind; &s;o that
putting one Knee to the Ground by her
Bed&s;ide, <HI>Can you forgive me, Madam, an
innocent and unintended Crime? Fortune
has had a mind to oblige me, by giving me
an opportunity to &s;hew the charming
Mrs.</HI> S&mdash;<HI>how true a re&s;pect and ad|miration
I have for her; and how well
I can keep her Secret. What has happen'd
this morning &s;hall pa&s;s untold, or like a
Dream that in endeavouring to remember
we but the more forget. I am neither of a
Birth or Character for doing ba&s;e or little
things, my Name, Madam, is&mdash;&mdash;, which I
<PB N="591" REF="453">
hope will in &s;ome &s;ort reconcile you to that
irrevocable Misfortune that has &s;o lately
happen'd. I give you my Word and Honour
never to di&s;clo&s;e it &s;o long as you &s;hall
think fit to have any confidence in my Se|crecy;
a farther di&s;tru&s;t will be as di&s;ob|liging
as the opportunity of being acquain|ted
with a Lady of your Beauty and Merit
was charming.&mdash;I had thought</HI> (&s;aid
that langui&s;hing fair One) <HI>my&s;elf &s;o little
known in the World, that I might without
danger have almo&s;t ventur'd any where.&mdash;You
forget, Madam,</HI> interrupted I
her ha&s;tily, <HI>that Per&s;ons of your Form
make not only &s;wift but deep Impre&s;&s;ions.
You could not &s;hine at the</HI> Bath <HI>a whole
Sea&s;on, and yet hope to be unknown:
Then your vani&s;hing from the Eyes of all
your Noble Relations and Acquaintance,
was a Theam as wonderful as melancholy.&mdash;What
do they &s;ay of me in the
World?</HI> interrupted &s;he: <HI>I am contented
to hear it.&mdash;Their Opinions were
different, Madam,</HI> I an&s;wer'd. <HI>For, what
could they imagine of a Lady of your Beau|ty
and Fortune, leaving the latter un|touch'd,
and a Noble Brother who was pa&s;|&s;ionately
fond of a Si&s;ter &s;o de&s;erving? Lea|ving,
I &s;ay, my Lord without knowledge
or con&s;olation for your departure? It was
found that you were come to</HI> London <HI>to
his Steward's Hou&s;e; but vani&s;hing from
thence; they could trace you no farther.
That faithful Servant has di&s;charged his
duty to you at be ought; for my Lord
<PB N="592" REF="454">
could never bring him to confe&s;s that he
had any knowledge of the place where you
were, or what cour&s;e you had taken. There
were not wanting tho&s;e who gave him the
glory of &s;uch a Conque&s;t, and his being a
married Man, might oblige you to conceal|ment:
But others, better acquainted with
your Soul, &s;aid, you could never make a
choice &s;o unworthy of your&s;elf; in which
they were confirm'd by time, when no de|mands
of Money were made, either by Let|ter
or $therwi&s;e, from or in your Name.
Others concluded you &s;uddenly dead in &s;ome
place where you were unknown, or that you
had been murder'd. But all this was non|&s;en&s;e;
for without &s;ome powerful motive,
what could have obliged you to be unknown,
tho' but for a day, and that motive might be
doubtle&s;s &s;till in force; therefore the mo&s;t
intelligible part of the World did not fail
to gue&s;s &s;ome happy young married Man of
Fortune had $word$ the glory of ple$$ng you
at the $span$ that with him (u$$$evy|ing
all other Delights) you were with drawn
to ta&s;te uninterruptedly the Sweets of mu|tual
Love.</HI>&mdash;Here &s;he turn'd her
Face upon the Pillow from me, and fetch|ing
a great Sign, we continued &s;ilent for
near a quarter of an Hour. I very well
&s;aw I was a Gue&s;t that was no way wel|com,
and was (as in Wi&s;dom I ought)
going &s;everal times to take my leave, and
retire: But chain'd by inevitable Incima|tion,
methought it was doing my&s;elf a
violence I could by no means con&s;ent to.
<PB N="593" REF="455">
If ever any Per&s;on could be truly &s;aid to
be &s;uddenly wounded, it was me. I lov'd
to a height of unea&s;ine&s;s, envy and jea|lou&s;ie,
and was re&s;olv'd to find and know
this happy Mr. <HI>King,</HI> (as &s;he call'd him)
and di&s;pute his Title to her. How often
could I have thrown my&s;elf down on the
Bed by her, and &s;moother'd her with a
thou&s;and Ki&s;&s;es and Embraces! But Re|&s;pect
and Awe, the &s;ure attendants of
Love, had &s;eiz'd upon my Soul, and me|thought
it was more ea&s;ie for me to die,
than to di&s;plea&s;e her. Therefore that at
length prevailing, I ro&s;e up to take my
leave, and conjur'd her to believe, that
her Secret was &s;afe with me; nay &s;o fare,
that&punc; if I once di&s;tru&s;ted my power of
keeping it, I would &s;acrifice my&s;elf before
her face to &s;ecure her Fears. She could
not chu&s;e but receive this a&s;&s;urance (which
I was not obliged to make) with a gracious
Air; and after &s;he had return'd me Thanks
for it, ask'd me, from what place I came
that morning? I told her, from&mdash;How,
<HI>cry'd &s;he,</HI> that is eight Miles wide
of this Hou&s;e: how could you wander
thus? How do you propo&s;e to return?
The Sun is of a great height; 'twill be
impo&s;&s;ible for you to walk without kil|ling
your&s;elf with heat. I &s;ee <HI>pur&s;a'd
&s;he with a charming Smile,</HI> that you are
intail'd upon me for &s;ome Hours; I can't
without being inho&s;pitable, thru&s;t you
out of my Hou&s;e till the Evening, then I
have a Chai&s;e at your &s;ervice, which &s;ome|times
<PB N="594" REF="456">
&s;erves me to take the Air. In the
mean time, I believe you will find &s;ome
Refre&s;hment nece&s;&s;ary after your early ri|&s;ing
and your great walk. Then reaching
me her delicious Hand to help her from
off the Bed, &s;he call'd her Woman, and
order'd her to bring in Chocolate, and
the Fruit &s;he had bid the Gardner gather
in the cool of the morning. Gue&s;s you,
Madam, how I was ravi&s;h'd with her
Propo&s;al: I needed not a &s;econd entreaty.
During our Breakfa&s;t, &s;he de&s;ir'd me to
entertain her with the News of the Town;
not only with what I call'd new, but what
had pa&s;s'd for this la&s;t three Years; for to
her that had been buried (in that little So|litude)
all things were &s;o. I did not fail
to flouri&s;h as far as my weak Capacity
permitted, upon what I thought would
divert her. Good Manners carried her
above any farther &s;how of di&s;tru&s;t or di&s;|content
of the morning's Adventure. She
&s;eem'd pleas'd at my Di&s;cour&s;e, and ask'd
me if I would give her leave to go into her
Dre&s;&s;ing-Room, to put her&s;elf in a Po|&s;ture
le&s;s capable of frighting me? And
how would I di&s;po&s;e of my&s;elf in the
mean time? She carried me into the
next Room, and &s;hew'd me a noble Li|brary
in gla&s;s Ca&s;es; if I thought fit to
divert my&s;elf there, or endeavour to reco|ver
my Fatigue of Walking, by a little
Sleep upon the Bed &s;he had quitted? I
cho&s;e the latter, that I might throw my
Body upon the place her lovely Body had
<PB N="595" REF="457">
pre&s;s'd. She took her leave, and left me
to my Reflexions, which were numerous
and di&s;order'd. I began violently to love,
without hopes of a return: I ki&s;s'd a
thou&s;and times the Pillows on which her
Head had re&s;ted; and where I imagin'd
it wet with her Tears, I could almo&s;t have
mingled my own with 'em. I was pa&s;&s;io|nate,
I was de&s;pairing, I was ravingly Amo|rous!
In &s;hort, all that the fein'd Hero's of
Romances are &s;aid to feel, I in reality was
&s;en&s;ible on. Who was Mr. <HI>King,</HI> that hap|py
Mr. <HI>King?</HI> I wanted much to know.
The Furniture of that little Box was like
a Cabinet, &s;o fine, &s;o clean, &s;o well &s;ui$$d
&s;o fi$ted for Love and Solitude. In &s;hort,
not able to obtain the intermi&s;&s;ion of
a moment's Sleep, I ro&s;e and pa&s;s'd
into the beautiful Garden. I was weary
of my&s;elf, and long'd to &s;ee ch$rming
Mrs. <HI>King</HI> again. I found a Gardner at
work, and ask'd him w$$n he expected
his Ma&s;ter home? The Fellow an&s;wer'd
me, he had been gone but that morning,
and he believ'd would not return till the
next. Re&s;pect to my beauteous Angel
hinder'd me from enquiring farther. I
return'd to the Hou&s;e, &s;urveying all the
Windows, in hopes &s;he would &s;ee that I
was not a&s;leep: 'Tis true I had a Book
in my Hand, but with Thoughts wandring
as mine were, that was of little u&s;e. I
walk'd back to the Bench where fir&s;t my
Pain began. There I found the pretty
Hat, and was &s;uch a Fool to ki&s;s it over
<PB N="596" REF="458">
and over, and talk to it of my Pain. In
a word, I re&s;olv'd if I could hand&s;omly,
to $$eal it as a Relick of my Saint; there|fore
brought it back and hid it in the
Room under the Bed where I had lain.
Two Flours (that is two Ages) had pa&s;s'd
&s;ince her ab&s;ence. How often did I cur&s;e
the Invention of D$$&s;&s;ing, nor did imagin
that &s;he could put on any more Charming
than what I had &s;een her in. Re&s;tle&s;s
every where, I return'd again to my Gar|den,
my Eyes never off the Windows
whence I believ'd my Satisfaction mu&s;t
come. The Sha$es were all up, but the
Curtains down; at length I &s;aw a lovely
Hand (which by the Diamond on the Fin|ger
I knew to be hers) rai&s;e one of 'em,
and &s;he her&s;elf appear'd dazling beyond
imagination. I immediately cry'd out War,
and told her, &s;he had maliciou&s;ly been arm|ing
her byes and Form, to revenge upon me
my pre&s;umption for treading that forbid|den
Ground. She &s;mil'd at what &s;he only
believ'd a piece of Gallantry, and ask'd
me obligingly, if I would come up, and
&s;he would &s;end her Woman to &s;hew me
the way. I flew after my Conductre&s;s;
but became immovable at the &s;ight of that
noble Air with which charming Mrs. <HI>King</HI>
appear'd; &s;o graceful, her Height &s;o ju&s;t,
&s;o commanding, her lovely Neck in all
its due proportion, her Shape &s;o perfect,
her Hair &s;o fine; in &s;hort, who &s;ays that
a <HI>Di&s;$abile</HI> can charm, when it conceals &s;o
many more Beauty than the Dre&s;s reveals?
<PB N="597" REF="459">
Doubtle&s;s &s;he &s;aw the Impre&s;&s;ion &s;he had
made upon my Mind; and to help me
out of my apparent Confu&s;ion, de&s;ir'd to
know if &s;he &s;hould entertain me at Piquet
till Dinner. I was, you may be &s;ure, all
Obedience; but I watch'd her Eyes a thou|&s;and
times more than the Cards. She
laugh'd at my Play, and told me I minded
not the Game, and that &s;he &s;hould gain
no honour by conquering. But what
&s;hould I &s;ay? Alas! I was no longer my|&s;elf,
all I did favour'd of Di&s;traction;
and I am a thou&s;and times wild at think|ing
how mean an opinion I mu&s;t have gi|ven
her of my Wit, in giving her &s;o ma|ny
proofs of my Love. Dinner &s;taid for
us below, I had the plea&s;ure of leading
her into a pretty Hall, floor'd with Mar|ble,
the &s;ides hung with large <HI>Indian</HI> Pi|ctures,
and &s;o high as the Chairs lin'd
with <HI>Dutch</HI> Tiles, a Fountain in a corner
of the Room joining the Buffet, wa&s;h'd
and cool'd our Gla&s;&s;es; nothing could be
better order'd than her Table. The fir&s;t
Service was in Plate, the &s;econd gilt, and
the la&s;t China. Her Woman and two
Grils of about 12 Years old (one of 'em
a Black, habited after the manner of the
Dancers at the Play Hou&s;e) were all the
Attendants we had; other Servants, as I
gue&s;s'd, waited without, to bring and re|ceive
the Di&s;hes, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> But, what was
all that Fea&s;t to me? My Eyes and
Sen&s;es were only fix'd upon charming
Mrs. <HI>King.</HI> She obligingly carv'd to me,
<PB N="598" REF="460">
when &s;he &s;aw I wou'd not help my&s;elf;
all &s;he cou'd get me to eat was a piece of
a Melon cool'd with Ice, and &s;ome Sallad,
which &s;he told me was of her own rai&s;ing.
Nor is your Lady&s;hip to wonder at my
naming Ice; there were Re&s;ervatories,
and, in &s;hort, all the convenience of a
Palace in this little Hou&s;e. Our Wine
was delicate, her Conver&s;ation charming,
and had I had but liberty of improving
my Happine&s;s without con&s;traint; and
&s;he kind, yielding, and pleas'd, the
whole Creation cou'd not have furni&s;h'd
out &s;uch another Scene of Delight.</P>
<P>This little Country Entertainment put
me in mind of <HI>Era&s;mus</HI>'s Spiritual Fea&s;t;
for Variety, I'll recite part of it to your
Lady&s;hip by way of Dialogue. She ask'd
me (when we ro&s;e from Table) how we
&s;hould pa&s;s the remainder of the Day?
for Cards &s;he did not &s;ee me fond of;
Do you love fi&s;hing, Sir? We have a large
Brook runs at the bottom of a Meadow,
where we catch excellent Trout; the Bank
is &s;hady after twelve a Clock; and I be|lieve
I can't offer you a Diver&s;ion that
&s;eems better to &s;uit your Temper; you
may be as thoughtful and contemplative as
you plea&s;e, I &s;hall be &s;ure not to interrupt
you, becau&s;e that Employment never
fails to have tho&s;e Effects upon me. The
Girls &s;hall bring down our Fi&s;hing-Tackle,
and wait at a di&s;tance fitted for Service, but
not Interruption. Bring hither the Um|brella's,
tho' we have no farther u&s;e of
<PB N="599" REF="461">
'em than cro&s;&s;ing the Meadow, and &s;hall find
it &s;hady and cool upon the Banks. One of
you run before with Cu&s;hions, and all
things nece&s;&s;ary for our Diver&s;ion. Have I
not told you true, Sir? Cou'd you imagine
any thing Plea&s;anter for the Sea&s;on? There's
your Rod, ca&s;t in your Line, and let us wager
who &s;hall catch the fir&s;t or mo&s;t Fi&s;h.</P>
<P><HI>He.</HI> All you &s;hew me, and all I have &s;een
and heard to Day, Madam, are &s;o won|derful,
that I am doubting whether I am
awake; or if awake, whether not In|chanted,
and in &s;ome of tho&s;e delightful
Ca&s;tles of Old, where every thing exceeds
Imagination. Whil&s;t we with our Lines and
Baits are &s;eeking to delude the poor harmle&s;s
Fi&s;h, methinks it were not improper to
begin a Di&s;cour&s;e of that Pa&s;&s;ion you can
&s;o well in&s;pire. I can make you no grea|ter
a Compliment, than putting you upon
a Subject which I am &s;ure you are the in|tire
Mi&s;tre&s;s of. Is it po&s;&s;ible, Madam,
to find Sweets in Love, capable of re|compen&s;ing
the lo&s;s of all other Delights?
And do not you think Friends, Relations,
Cards, Plays, Balls; and, in &s;hort, every
Diver&s;ion, proper for your Youth and For|tune,
much under&s;old by this Choice that
you have made? I do not reflect upon
happy Mr. <HI>King</HI>'s Charms; I know him
not; but pardon me if I do not think any
mortal Merit can de&s;erve &s;o great a Sacri|fice,
after the generous and ho&s;pitable
Entertainment you have made me, and in
good Manners I ought to wave any Di&s;|cour&s;e
<PB N="600" REF="462">
upon this Subject. But, Madam,
I have a nearer concern for you than
what relates to Cu&s;tom and Ceremony.
I wou'd argue you out of this wrong way
you are in, re&s;tore you to your Family
and Fortune; &s;uch a Beauty as yours was
de&s;ign'd to adorn a Court, not gild a Cot|tage.
I judge what you are able to do upon
others, by what I feel you have done up|on
me. Therefore it is that I wou'd have
you &s;hine where Fortune and your Birth
&s;eems to call you, and to leave this inglo|rious
Solitude, where the be&s;t that can be
&s;aid of your Plea&s;ures, are, that they be
not Pains, tho&s;e excepted which you ta&s;te
when your happy Lover is with you.</P>
<P><HI>She.</HI> The Privilege you have taken in
choo&s;ing &s;uch a Subject as this (however
ungrateful it be to me) &s;hall at this time
be forgiven, becau&s;e I believe you attempt
the Argument out of Friend&s;hip; for I
know you &s;o true a judge of what is fit,
that upon any other account you would
not have been guilty of it; but whence
is it that you mi&s;take &s;o far, to think I
do not enjoy more Happine&s;s than if I
were in a Court? Tho&s;e Diver&s;ions you
have nam'd, are but Noi&s;e and Hurry, and
may indeed plea&s;e the Sen&s;es, but never
the Mind, in <HI>that</HI> lies all our Enjoyment,
'tis there that we place all our mo&s;t af|fecting
Delights, our mo&s;t ravi&s;hing Sweets;
'tis that only that can indear our Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;i|ons
to us; for &s;hou'd the Mind be fix'd
upon another Object, a Monarch with his
<PB N="601" REF="463">
Crown wou$d $span$ imoe$tinent Ambiti|on,
and a Glory no more plea&s;ing, than
Vanity can be truly call'd Merit, or ex|tream
old Age a Ble&s;&s;ing.</P>
<P><HI>He.</HI> And yet, Madam, was I not this
happy Morning a witne&s;s how many ways
you &s;ought to delude tho&s;e Hours that
apparently hung upon your Hands? So$i|tude
is doubtle&s;s &s;ometimes good to tho&s;e
who have Souls capable of ta&s;ting it; 'tis
the exce&s;s of it is only blameable. We na|turally
de&s;ire Conver&s;ation, and variety in
Conver&s;ation; for being always confin'd
to one, is but a degree beyond conver&s;ing
with our&s;elves. Mi&s;take me not, I do
not argue again&s;t that enchant$ng Plea&s;ure
only to be ta&s;ted between happy Lovers,
but wou'd learn from your Experience,
if continuance and length of time does not
take off the Delight, the tran&s;porting
Ardours which are heightned by Difficul|ties,
as much as it &s;eems to me they
&s;hou'd be pa&s;&s;'d by too con&s;tant u&s;e, or too
ea&s;ie an acce&s;&s;ion of 'em.</P>
<P><HI>She.</HI> I &s;hou'd belye the Truth, Sir, or
per&s;onare the Vertue of the <HI>Stoicks,</HI> did I
pretend never to have found &s;ome Hours
of Solitude burthen&s;om; but how am I
&s;ure I &s;hou'd not have receiv'd as much
or more di&s;gu&s;t from Conver&s;ation and
the Bu&s;ine&s;s of the World? Are any thing
more feign'd than your Friend&s;hips; more
fal&s;e than your Lovers; more impertinent
than Go&s;&s;ips; more cen&s;orious than Re|lations;
more dull than many that are
<PB N="602" REF="464">
call'd Wits; or &s;o in&s;ipid and ta&s;tele&s;s as
Conver&s;ation, when Love, Scandal, and
Bu&s;ine&s;s are away? Then, as for what you
call Diver&s;ions from Balls, Cards, and
P$ays; the latter can as well, with a
little help of the Imagination, entertain
me in my Clo&s;et or Garden, as if I were
at either of the Hou&s;es. Balls are much
di&s;u&s;ed, and were ever made upon &s;ome
particular De&s;ign, and not always with
too much Innocency. Cards are &s;o dan|gerous
a Diver&s;ion, that I &s;hould never
have done, did I recount half the ruin and
di&s;order they have occa&s;ion'd; ev'n in my
Solitude, I have heard what but the other
Day happen'd upon this account. A
young Lady of a good Family in the
Country, and married to a Gentleman
who will have a hand&s;om E&s;tate when
his Father's Dead, came up to <HI>London,</HI>
and fell into &s;o ill Hands, and &s;o great a
lover of Play, that &s;he quickly lo&s;t all
her ready Money, and made away her
Dre&s;&s;ing Plate, Jewels, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> for a &s;upply;
that gone too, her la&s;t Stake was a pair
of Diamond Bar Rings of my Lady&mdash;
her Mothers, which &s;he gave her to have
new &s;et; &s;he under pawn'd 'em for a great
deal le&s;s than they were worth; fifty
Pound was the Sum &s;he got upon 'em,
with which &s;he hoped to retrieve the re&s;t,
and turn the run of her ill Fortune; but
&s;he quickly lo&s;t that too, if &s;he had
had a Million in the ill Hands &s;he was in,
'twou'd have all flown the &s;ame way.
<PB N="603" REF="465">
What &s;hou'd &s;he do? Her Husband was
in the Country, her Mother &s;evere and
covetous, with two Daughters upon
her Hands; their Father dying without a
Will, they had hopes of no other For|tune
but what my Lady cou'd &s;ave 'em
out of her Joynture; therefore in all pro|bability,
&s;he would be extreamly angry at
this Extravangancy in her married Daugh|ter.
A mortal Melancholy &s;ucceeded:
She complain'd to one that had been her
Mother's Woman, a fatal Coun&s;ellor; who
bid her be of good Comfort, 'twou'd be a
&s;trange thing for a young Lady, Hand&s;om
and Innocent, to want Money in a World
like this. Then taking Pen and Paper, &s;he
be thought her of offering her to my
Lord of <HI>S</HI>&mdash;at the Price of the
Ear-Rings. The young Lady had &s;een
him at a Race in her own Country, and
con&s;ented at the expence of her Vertue, to
be made a Sacrifice by that dete&s;table
Creature. But his Grace (who loves
Money too well) refus'd the offer, unle&s;s
he could fir&s;t &s;ee the young Lady; nor
wou'd promi&s;e then to like her, becau&s;e
he was already engag'd; tho' 'tis thought
the Fifty Pieces were his Mi&s;tre&s;s. See
then if any thing can be more pernici|ous
than Gaming. I cou'd name you
&s;everal In&s;tances diverting enough to tho&s;e
who have no Friend&s;hip or Relation to
the Unfortunate. I think the King of
<HI>France</HI> had done well, if in forbidding
Ba&s;&s;et, he had al&s;o forbid all Ladies un|der
<PB N="604" REF="466">
Thirty, to play for above &s;uch a Sum
of Money; and that other Governments
wou'd do the &s;ame thing.</P>
<P><HI>He.</HI> You almo&s;t argue me, Madam,
out of my ill opinion of Solitude; not
but if Conver&s;ation be an Evil, I dare
boldly maintain, 'tis an Evil we cannot be
without, and where the Good (notwith|&s;tanding
all your Lady&s;hip has &s;aid) &s;ur|mounts
the Bad; but this is but half of
my Reque&s;t, you have not an&s;wer'd me
to that Part; Whether too ea&s;ie, and un|intermitting
an Enjoyment, does not pall
the Ardour and le&s;&s;en the Delight?</P>
<P><HI>She.</HI> You are very curious, methinks,
and will let me catch no Fi&s;h; if we don't
&s;ucceed, I can't tell what you will do for
Supper, you have, as yet, eat nothing,
and 'twill be barbarous to &s;end you hence
half &s;tarved; at this rate you wou'd have
but little rea&s;on to boa&s;t of your Ad|venture.
Ah! &s;ee I have caught the
fir&s;t, 'tis a lovely Trout: Oh poor Crea|ture,
how it &s;truggles and pants now 'tis
out of its Element. Here, <HI>Mynae,</HI> take
care of this poor Wretch; where's the
Net to put it in? Oh don't hurt it. So,
tie it clo&s;e that it may not get out, bait
my Hook again, and go to your Compa|tion.</P>
<P><HI>He.</HI> How happy are you, Madam,
that can be thus amu&s;ed, that is, &s;o
cheaply pleas'd? Ah, 'tis impo&s;&s;ible that
any great Pa&s;&s;ion can po&s;&s;e&s;s a Soul &s;o
&s;erenely calm. I, who pretended all my
<PB N="605" REF="467">
life to that happy Indifference, and who
but ye&s;terd$y cou'd have been as ea&s;ily
diverted, feel it otherwi&s;e now. I wetch
your lovely Eye in&s;tead of the Fi&s;hing.
Line, and $m caught my&s;elf, in&s;tead of
catching others.</P>
<P><HI>She.</HI> This Gallantry makes you Men
&s;o impertinent. Pray tell me, do you
think we expect the&s;e &s;ort of Court&s;hips?
It mu&s;t certainly be &s;o, el&s;e upon all Oc|ca&s;ions,
and to all Per&s;ons, you wou'd
never tous promi&s;cuou&s;ly u&s;e 'em.</P>
<P><HI>He.</HI> I cou'd ea&s;ily convince you, Ma|dam,
that you are treated by me in a par|ticular
manner to what other Ladies are;
but it wou'd be too great a pre&s;umption
for a Stranger, till by my Services I may
have merited the liberty of &s;peaking. I
wou'd begin by re&s;$oring you to the
World, to your Family and Fame, which
I mu&s;t &s;incerely tell you, &s;uffers all things
by your unaccountable Ab&s;ence. I &s;hall
appear rather a Divine than a Gallant in
wha$ $span$ going to &s;ay; your Friend I
$word$ am and wou'd &s;h$w what others
perhaps may but &s;peak. An&s;wer me,
Madam, to what I not long &s;ince ask'd
you; it is $span$ that the Ardour of
your fir&s;t blames feels no decay. Upon
that I ground my Propo&s;ition, if you
plea&s;e to be &s;incere, I &s;hall be proud
to think my&s;elf not Impertinent; other|wi&s;e
upon this Subject I mu&s;t be for ever
dumb before you.</P>
<P><PB N="606" REF="468">
<HI>She.</HI> You put me &s;trangely to it; for
If I a&s;&s;ert my Con&s;tancy, you will be apt
to call it Di&s;&s;imulation; if I admit an
Abatement, or what you call a Decay,
my Principles will be taxed: But certain
it is, were it to do again, I &s;hould pre|fer
my Fame and Family before all things.
But how can I return? What account &s;hall
I give of my Ab&s;ence? Who will believe
that I have been Innocent whil&s;t ab&s;ent?
Relieve me from this Difficulty, and I
will admit you to be the Friend you pro|fe&s;s.</P>
<P><HI>He.</HI> The matter, Madam, is not &s;o
hard as you imagin; if you'll depend up|on
my method, I'll engage to find you
one that &s;hall &s;ucceed. Pretend a change
of Religion, retire your&s;elf into &s;ome Ca|tholick
Country, Pen&s;ion your&s;elf in a Mona|&s;try,
write to your. Friends from thence,
that you have &s;een your Error, and are
willing to return to your Mothe Church;
Money can do all things, and that you
need never want, without touching your
own Fortune. We may ea&s;ily make be be|liev'd
that you have been out of <HI>England</HI>
the&s;e three Years, and that your Jewels
have more than an&s;wer'd your religious
Expences; but not finding that Sa$$sfacti|on
in your change which you pr$pos'd,
you de&s;ign a return, contrary to your re|&s;olve
when you went out of <HI>England;</HI>
that the Grief you knew your Conver&s;ion
would cau&s;e to my Lord&mdash;an$ the
re&s;t of your Relations, was the only rea|&s;on
<PB N="607" REF="469">
that made you conceal not only that
but the place of your Abode.</P>
<P><HI>She.</HI> Is it lawful, think you, for our
private ends to trifle with Religion, and
make the greate&s;t good a cover for our
ill?</P>
<P><HI>He.</HI> Not if Religion &s;uffer'd by our
Pretences; but, Madam, when all things are
&s;acred to us that &s;hould be &s;o, we ought
not to &s;cruple at &s;mall things: The good
People of the Mona&s;try, as we may order
it, will certify that you have been there
&s;uch a time, if they are but well paid for
it: Tho' I do not think there will be any
occa&s;ion for the Que&s;tion, your Affair hav|ing
pa&s;s'd already with that &s;ecrecy. Be|&s;ides,
'twill be the intere&s;t of your Fa|mily
not them&s;elves to look too near, but
to aid tho&s;e de&s;igns that &s;hall endeavour
to re&s;tore you clear to the opinion of the
World.</P>
<P><HI>She.</HI> But my charming Solitude, my
dearer, quiet, delightful Moments, how
can I part with ye for ever?</P>
<P><HI>He.</HI> Con&s;ider, Madam, you do but
leave that which will inevitably for&s;ake
you: The time repeated that you have
been here, (or long before) and all the&s;e
Plea&s;ures, will fly before you, even now
(or I deceive my judgment) they appear
but as the Gho&s;ts of what they have been,
when De&s;ire was new, your Joy$ in their
fir&s;t bloom, and Fame, and Honour, abun|dantly
le&s;s e&s;teem'd.</P>
<P><PB N="608" REF="470">
<HI>She.</HI> Hold, do not wound me in that
tender Part; there, I confe&s;s, I he too
open to your A&s;&s;ault: I would retrieve
my Glory at the price of my Life; but
Love is &s;till beyond 'em both.</P>
<P><HI>He.</HI> God forbid, Madam, that &s;o ele|vated
a Soul &s;hould be capable of &s;o crimi|nal
a Weakne&s;s, e&s;pecially after three
Years po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. Con&s;ider, by your lon|ger
&s;tay you will lo&s;e the opportunity of
returning to your Fame and Family:
Whil&s;t Youth and Beauty are of our &s;ides,
all things will be the more ea&s;ily believ'd.
Let me conjure you to enter into your&s;elf,
and examin but your own Brea&s;t: Cannot
tho&s;e heroick Thoughts, the natural Com|panions
to noble Birth, overcome a Frailty
which cu&s;tom and opinion has render'd
the Scandal and Weakne&s;s of your Sex,
and the Contempt of ours? Figure to
your&s;elf there may come a time (all char|ming
as you are) when this happy Lover,
this unknown Mr. <HI>King,</HI> may himself be
weary of tho&s;e Joys which he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es
with too great a calm: Fore&s;ta$ him,
Madam, fore&s;tall the natural Incon&s;tancy
of our Sex, and &s;hew that you dare bold|ly
&s;trike for Glory, tho' by it all your
Delights are levell'd with common Plea|&s;ures.</P>
<P><HI>She.</HI> I will con&s;ider deeply on what
you offer, and in the mean time return
you a thou&s;and Thanks for what you
have &s;aid: You mu&s;t have friendly Care
of me, or you would not have taken this
<PB N="609" REF="471">
pains in my Conver&s;ion, but for the pre|&s;ent
let us wave this Argument, and on|ly
think how we &s;hall pa&s;s the re&s;t of the
Day in Plea&s;ures le&s;s &s;evere than this
Conver&s;ation? I thought, Madam, to
have gain'd a mighty point in &s;taggering
her Inclination to Solitude, and that
cou'd I but once draw her into the World;
I &s;hou'd have many opportunities (as be|ing
nece&s;&s;ary to her Service) to in&s;inuate
my Pa&s;&s;ion, which every moment receiv'd
addition by her lovely Per&s;on; her grace|ful
Motions, her all commanding Glances,
and ten thou&s;and inimitable un&s;cribable
Graces. The re&s;t of the Evening we &s;pent
in Gallantry; I told her all that I cou'd
to divert and give her an opinion of my
Conver&s;ation: Methought &s;he &s;eem'd to
ta&s;te it with &s;ome Plea&s;ure, and that how|ever
&s;he profe&s;s'd her&s;elf a lover of Soli|tude,
&s;he was no real Enemy to Company.</P>
<P>She wou'd keep me to Supper; the
Moon &s;hone, and the Chai&s;e, &s;he &s;aid,
wou'd quickly carry me eight Mile. I was
tran&s;ported at her Civility, and almo&s;t
began to think, that Solitude being a
Friend to Love, tho&s;e few opportunities
&s;he had of conver&s;ing, gave her a higher
Reli&s;h; and that it wou'd be no hard mat|ter,
by a Repetition or my Vi&s;its, to gain
her Favour. I ask'd her not the permi&s;|&s;ion,
becau&s;e tho&s;e are things which by a
Lover ought to be taken; and he is worthy
to be deny'd who attempts to beg what
he &s;hould boldly &s;eize. When the Mo|moment
<PB N="610" REF="472">
of Separation came, it was as if my
Soul and Body parted; I ki&s;s'd her Hand
with a profound Sigh, telling her I car|ry'd
along with me her charming Image,
which wou'd continually play before my
&s;ight, and &s;uffer me to have no other plea|&s;ure
but Reflexion, till I repeated my
Happine&s;s by &s;eeing her again.</P>
<P>All the time I was in the Chai&s;e, I may
very well &s;ay I knew not who I was, nor
where I was going; but buried in a pro|found
Contemplation, my whole Thoughts
ran upon charming Mrs. <HI>King,</HI> and we
were come to the end of the Town before
I con&s;ider'd of it. There was no Foot-Man
with me, &s;o that the Chai&s;e &s;top|ping,
the Coachman alighted, and com|ing
up with much Civility, told me, he
hop'd I would not take it ill, for his
Commi&s;&s;ion ended here, having no orders
to go into the Town. This rous'd me
from my Pen&s;ivene&s;s; I in a moment found
the fair Lady had been too cunning for
me, that &s;he had only kept me till, Night
on purpo&s;e that I &s;hould not know the
Road I was carried, nor any of tho&s;e Vil|lages
we went through; and I may &s;afe|ly
prote&s;t, that all pa&s;s'd as if it had been
a Dream to me. However, I did not fail
to obey her &s;eeming Orders, and in quit|ting
the Chai&s;e, return'd my Thanks and
Duty to the Lady; I gue&s;s'd 'twas vain to
ask Que&s;tions of the Coachman. How|ever,
I cou'd nor choo&s;e but cur&s;e my own
Folly. Had any one ask'd me of my Ad|ventures,
<PB N="611" REF="473">
all the account I cou'd give,
was, that I had been in a pretty Hou&s;e,
one Mr. <HI>King</HI>'s, &s;eated far from any com|mon
Road; but where or how the place
was call'd, or any near it, I cou'd not tell,
nor was it the lea&s;t part of the Addre&s;s
of the lovely Charmer, by which I found
my Vanity mortify'd, and my&s;elf deceiv'd.
I imagin'd &s;he ta&s;ted no Plea&s;ure in my
Conver&s;ation, &s;ince by this la&s;t Action &s;he
apparently &s;hew'd, that &s;he did not de&s;ire
the continuance of it. Home I walk'd to
my fair Maid, whom I had left behind.
She imagin'd me lo&s;t (as indeed I was
to my&s;elf) or that &s;ome Misfortune had
befallen me. Her Que&s;tions and Kindne&s;s
were both in&s;ipid and impertinent. I
went to bed upon the pretence of weari|ne&s;s,
to avoid her; where my la&s;t Adven|ture
came fre&s;h into my Mind, and du|ring
a &s;hort interval of Sleep, I po&s;&s;e&s;t the
lovely Charmer in my Thoughts, all melt|ing,
full of Rapture and Delight. The
Tran&s;port awak'd me, and &s;oon made me
&s;en&s;ible, not only of my Mi&s;take, but of
the cruel Separation we had &s;o lately &s;uf|f$r'd.</P>
<P>The next Day I went to <HI>London,</HI> to en|deavour,
if po&s;&s;ible, to divert in Company
this new unea&s;ine&s;s of Heart. But in vain,
I cou'd not hinder the bent of my Mind
from returning to the Object that had
charm'd it, nor my Per&s;on from being
hurried by my Inclinations back to&mdash;I
left my fair Companion in <HI>London,</HI> &s;o
<PB N="612" REF="474">
that uninterruptedly I cou'd ta&s;te the
height of Melancholy and Contemplati|on.
Early the next Morning, I ro&s;e, and
dre&s;&s;ing with a more than ordinary Care,
I put my&s;elf upon repeating my former
Adventure. I attemptd to find the way
to Mr. <HI>King</HI>'s Hou&s;e, cro&s;s'd over Lanes
and Fields, but in vain. I believ'd, in&s;tead
of eight, I went thirty Miles, here and
there, wandering without a Guide, de&s;|cribing
the Hou&s;e, and asking of all I
met with for it, by his Name but $word$ Tidings
cou'd I get. So th$n $span$ weary,
I was forc'd to take into $word$ to refre&s;h
my&s;elf. There I ear what the place cou'd
afford, and laid me down on a Bed to
&s;leep; but that was $word$ indeavour, to
re&s;t me the$; whil&s;t the heat of the Day
la&s;ted. That over, I began again my
fruitle&s;s &s;earch; and by that time it was
dark, found my&s;elf at a Village eighteen
Miles from <HI>London,</HI> and fourteen from
the place I had &s;et out from. You may
gue&s;s, Madam, that next Morning I was
forced to &s;earch for &s;ome better Conveni|ency
for Travelling, than I had had the
Day before. I procur'd a Coach for
<HI>London;</HI> where I was no &s;ooner arrived,
than I order'd my Hor&s;es with two Ser|vants
to be brought. I mounted and re|turn'd
back to&mdash;. From whence I
again &s;et out upon my Search, ob&s;tinate to
find what &s;eem'd &s;o difficult. We took
different Roads; and not to tire your
Patience, &s;ought almo&s;t over the whole
Country before my Curio&s;ity was gratify'd.
<PB N="613" REF="475">
At length 'twas my own good Fortune to
recover the Hou&s;e. I knock'd, but there
was nobody to open, the Shutters were
clo&s;e, and not the le&s;t &s;ign of any living
Creature; I compa&s;s'd the Hou&s;e, and
coming to the Garden-Gate, found the
Windows of the Trillow clo&s;e; I knock'd,
but with no better Succe&s;s. I try'd all
the Lanes near the Hou&s;e; one led me to
a &s;mall Village about a quarter of a Mile
diffance, where my Curio&s;ity was referr'd
to a little Ale. Hou&s;e on the right hand, near
where Mr. <HI>King</HI> had liv'd. I was not
long in finding it; I alighted and went to
examine my Landlady; but alas! from
her I gain'd but the confirmation of that
Misfortune, which I before too ju&s;tly
fear'd. She told me they were gone a|way,
(the Day of their removal I found
to be the next but one of my Adventure)
but where &s;he cou'd not t$ll; the whole
Furniture of the Hou&s;e being carried
thence, it was not likely that they pro|pos'd
to return. I ask'd her, if &s;he had e|ver
&s;een Mr. <HI>King?</HI> She told me, often,
and drew a Per&s;on I cou'd no way gue&s;s at.
Then her Husband was call'd to help out
his Wife's ill Painting; their De&s;criptions
were not the &s;ame in any one Feature; next
the Son and Daughter came under Exami|nation;
but not any of 'em agreed &s;o much
as in the colour of Mr. <HI>King</HI>'s Perriwig;
unle&s;s it were in that one Article, that
neither he nor his Lady, in all the time
they had liv'd there, were ever known to
go to Church; that they were very proud
<PB N="614" REF="476">
Folk, for they wou'd not be acquainted
with any of their Neighbours, and carry'd
their Heads very high, for all he was but
a Mr. Tho' belike a Servant in a Livery
calling to Drink one day at their Hou&s;e,
and &s;eeing Mr. <HI>King</HI> pa&s;s by in a Chai&s;e,
&s;aid, he was a Lord! my Lord, my Lord,
of the Lord knows what; for they had
forgot. How cou'd I have cur&s;t their hap|py
Stupidity; what wou'd I not have given
to have had 'em recal that one little act
of Memory, that bare Word, that con&s;e|quence
of my Lord&mdash;the Lord
knows what, my Lord, the Lord knows
who; for thus in their proper Dialect did
they think fit to &s;eize me. I learn't from
'em that Mr. <HI>King</HI> had purchas'd that lit|tle
Hou&s;e, and now they were departed,
'twas lock'd up without any intention of its
being Let. There's a rare Garden (cries the
Female Brute) and choice Fruit; I wou'd
<HI>Roger</HI> wou'd let our <HI>John</HI> try to get over
the Garden-Wall and gather Ma&s;ter &s;ome.
I clos'd in with the good Woman, and got
leave for our <HI>John,</HI> tho' my bu&s;ine&s;s was
to have him open the back Gate; I want|ed
methought to wander in tho&s;e Walks
alone, where I had been once ble&s;t with
my cruel fugitive. I cou'd have out rav'd
<HI>Oroondates,</HI> out-talkd all the Heroes of
antiquity, in complaining on my more
abdurate <HI>Statira.</HI> To be &s;hort, our <HI>John</HI>
&s;ucceeded beyond imagination, for whether
thro' chance or forgetfulne&s;s, the Key
was left on the in&s;ide the Door. When I
<PB N="615" REF="477">
&s;aw it open to me, I thought my&s;elf as happy as if
I were entering Paradi&s;e. But ala&s;s! that Joy
was but of &s;mall duration; I found there no foot|&s;teps
of my lovely Charmer, nor a likelihood of
her return; for all the fine Pots and Greens
were gone, the Garden in great di&s;order and an
apparent negle&s;t of every thing. I a&s;cended
the Terra&s;s, leaving <HI>John</HI> to the Fruit, and
went to &s;it me down on a Seat rais'd with
Turf, and cover'd with Camomile, at the ex|tremity
of the Walk, in that very place where
once I had re&s;ted with my Charmer. I
threw my&s;elf like a fond amorous Fool, at my
length upon the Seat; I ki&s;s'd, I talk'd to
tho&s;e happy in&s;en&s;ible Vegetable, as if they
cou'd have given me an account of my Lo&s;s;
at length growing a little cooler, I gave my
Thoughts and Eyes leave to con&s;ider upon a
piece of Camomile, of about a Foot &s;quare,
cub and cemented again. I took a Pen-knife
from my <HI>Etney,</HI> and parting the Earth, follow'd
the impre&s;&s;ion that had been made before; and
quickly found it but a cover to a Hole that had
been digg'd there. I continu'd to remove the
Earth, till I di&s;cover'd and with little labour, took
up a &s;mall <HI>Indian</HI> Trunk; by the lightne&s;s I gue&s;s'd
there cou'd be nothing of value in it; I weigh'd
long within my&s;elf whether I &s;hou'd open it? I
cou'd not ea&s;ily (being &s;o &s;elf-intere&s;ted) deter|mine
whether it was a ba&s;e Action or not. At
length, all tran&s;ported with Curio&s;ity, I found a
means, by the help of &s;ome of my Tools, to force
the Lock; there was nothing in it but Papers;
but what, think you were tho&s;e Papers? Why in|deed
happy Mr. <HI>King</HI>'s Love Letters, and her
An&s;wers; their was neither Name or Addre&s;s to
any of them; they $$em'd as if they had all came
inclos'd, &s;o that my Curio&s;ity was as much at a
lo&s;s as before. However, I re&s;olv'd upon that
piece of Revenge, to bear 'em away with me; I
<PB N="616" REF="478">
&s;oon empty'd the Trunk, and return'd that to its Re|po&s;itory,
cover'd it with Earth as before, and fix'd
upon it the Camomile piece of Earth as I fir&s;t found
it. Away I carry'd my Trea&s;ure <HI>Trovue.</HI> Di&s;charg|ing
our <HI>John</HI> and his Mother, I took two or three
Peaches and Nectrins, mounted my Hor&s;e, and got
me into the Road for <HI>London;</HI> but my Curio&s;ity gave
me no intermi&s;&s;ion till I had &s;truck into a &s;hady place,
where alighting, I took out my fatal Cargo, and fell
to reading tho&s;e mortifying, tran&s;por$ing Papers.
How did I envy the happy Fortune of that b$e&s;t un|known
Mr. <HI>King.</HI> Oh what tender unimaginable &s;oft|ne&s;&s;es
were there in her Letters! the very Soul of
Love, as if the God had took up his re&s;idence in her
Heart, and from thence in&s;pir'd tho&s;e inimitable
Lines. I &s;hall not in the lea&s;t &s;peak maliciou&s;ly,
when I tell you, that my Rivals were much inferiour;
methought there was a poorne&s;s of Stile, a meanne&s;s
of Expre&s;&s;ion, a &s;tudied Pa&s;&s;ion in his; whil&s;t hers
were full of luxuriant Nature, rich in Love and Beau|ty.
I read &s;o long, till I almo&s;t lo&s;t the &s;mall remain|der
of my Sen&s;es, which had never been very perfect,
&s;ince I had fir&s;t &s;een Mrs. <HI>King.</HI> What &s;hall I &s;ay?
Thus have I remain'd, and am $ikely to do till I re|trive
that adorable Wanderer. There is nothing, no
means une&s;&s;ay'd by me to recover her, I have Emi&s;&s;o|ries
in every part of <HI>London</HI> and near it, to bring me
the De&s;cription of all that are reputed Strangers; I
cou'd lavi&s;h with Joy my whole E&s;tate upon the
Search, had I but a certainty at la&s;t of &s;ucceeding.&mdash;Oh
forgive me for thus long burthening you with my
Misfortunes: I write for ea&s;e and con&s;olation; there's
not another Friend upon Earth who &s;hou'd &s;hare this
Secret with me; not that I conceive my&s;elf bound
by any Promi&s;e of mine to Mrs. <HI>King,</HI> &s;ince &s;he &s;o in|gratefully
refus'd to confide in me; but Love and
Re&s;pect makes me wi&s;h her Fault may for ever be a
Secret to the World. Wrong not the Confidance (I
conjure you) that I have in your Vertue and Silence;
keep it inviolable, pre&s;erve it as you wou'd the Heart
of your happie&s;t Lover: So may you never know the
angui&s;h of a Di&s;appointment; never feel the Pangs
with which charming Mrs. <HI>King</HI>'s unalterable Adorer
a&s;&s;erts him&s;elf, <HI>Madam, your mo&s;t obedient,</HI></P>
