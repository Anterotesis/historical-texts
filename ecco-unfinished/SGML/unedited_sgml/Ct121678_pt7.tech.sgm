<P>IN the article Buffalo, we remarked, that the
modern Latins had improperly applied to it
the name <HI>bubalus.</HI> This appellation antiently
belonged to the animal we are now treating of,
<PB N="2" REF="8">
who&s;e nature is very different from that of
the buffalo. In &s;ome external qualities it re|&s;embles
the &s;tag, the gazelles, and the ox. It
re&s;embles the &s;tag in &s;ize and figure<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">See the figure and de&s;cription of the Barbary cow in the <HI>Mem. pour &s;ervir &agrave; l'hi&s;t. des animaux, part. 2. p. 24. tab.</HI> 39.</NOTE>, and par|ticularly
in the form of its limbs: But its
horns are permanent, and nearly con&s;tructed
like tho&s;e of the large&s;t gazelles, to which it is
allied by this character as well as its natural di&s;|po&s;itions.
Its head, however, is much longer
than that of the gazelles, or even that of the
&s;tag. In fine, it re&s;embles the ox in the length
<PB N="3" REF="9">
of the muzzle, and in the di&s;po&s;ition of the
bones of the head, which, as in the ox, jut
not out behind farther than the frontal bone.
The&s;e relations in external &s;tructure, joined to
its antient name being forgotten, are the rea|&s;ons
why, in modern times, it has obtained the
compound denominations of <HI>bu&s;elaphus, bull|&s;tag,</HI>
bucula-cervina, <HI>cow-hind, Barbary cow,</HI>
&amp;c. Even the name <HI>bubalus</HI> comes from bu|bulus,
and has been applied to it on account of
the &s;imilarity of this animal to the ox.</P>
<P>The head of the bubalus is narrow; the eyes
are placed very high; and the front is &s;hort and
narrow. The horns are large, black, permanent,
and furni&s;hed with large rings. They &s;pring
near each other, but recede con&s;iderably at their
extremities. They bend backward, and are twi&s;t|ed
&s;pirally<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot"><HI>See</HI> Mem. pour &s;ervir &agrave; l'hi&s;t. des animaux, part. 2. p. 24. tab. 39.</NOTE>. His &s;houlders are &s;o high, that
they form a kind of bunch on the withers.
The tail is nearly a foot long, and garni&s;hed
with a tuft of hairs at the point. The ears are
&s;imilar to tho&s;e of the <HI>antilope.</HI> Kolbe<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">The African elk.&mdash;Its head is beautiful, and re&s;embles that of the &s;tag, but it is &s;maller in proportion to the &s;ize of the body. Its horns are about a foot in length. Near the head they are rugged, but &s;traight, uniform, and pointed at the extremities. Its neck is free and beautiful. The up|per lip is a little larger than the under. Its limbs are long, thin, and delicate; and its tail is about a foot in length. The hair which covers its body is &s;oft, &s;mooth, and of an a&s;h-co|lour.&mdash;The African elk weighs about four hundred pounds; <HI>De&s;cript. du Cap de Bonne-e&s;perance, par Kolbe, tom. 3. chap.</HI> 4.</NOTE> has
<PB N="4" REF="10">
given to this animal the appellation of <HI>elk,</HI> though
it has no other re&s;emblance to the elk than in
its hair being more &s;lender at the root than in
the middle, or at the point, which is peculiar to
tho&s;e two animals; for, in almo&s;t every qua|druped,
the hair is always gro&s;&s;er at the root
than in the middle, or at the point. The hair
of the bubalus is nearly of the &s;ame colour with
that of the elk, though it is much &s;horter, &s;ofter,
and le&s;s bu&s;hy<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">The habit of body, the legs, and the neck of this animal, give it a &s;tronger re&s;emblance to a &s;tag than to a cow, of which la&s;t he has only the horns, and even the&s;e differ con|&s;iderably from tho&s;e of the cow. They &s;pring very near each other; becau&s;e the head is here extremely narrow; but, in the cow, the front is very large. They are about a foot long, black, bended backward, twi&s;ted &s;pirally, and &s;o u&s;ed before and above, that the elevations of the &s;crew were almo&s;t en|tirely effaced. The tail exceeded not thirteen inches in length, including the tuft of hair at the point, which was three inches long. The ears re&s;embled tho&s;e of the gazelles, the in&s;ide being garni&s;hed, in &s;ome places, with white hair; the re&s;t was naked, and exhibited a &s;kin perfectly black and &s;mooth. The eyes were high and &s;o near the horns, that the head &s;eemed to have no front. There were only two very thin, &s;hort teats, which render this animal very different from our cows. The &s;houlders were &s;o high, that they formed a kind of bunch on the withers.&mdash;This animal &s;eems rather to be the bubalus of the antients than the &s;mall African ox de&s;cribed by Belon; for Solinus compares the bubalus to the &s;tag; Oppian gives him horns turned backward; and Pliny &s;ays, that he par|takes of the calf and &s;tag; <HI>Mem. pour &s;ervir &agrave; l'hi&s;t. des a|nimaux, part. 2. p.</HI> 25.</NOTE>. The&s;e are the only re&s;emblances
between the elk and bubalus; for they differ in
every other particular. The horns of the elk
are larger and heavier than tho&s;e of the &s;tag, and
are likewi&s;e renewed annually. The horns of
the bubalus, on the contrary, never fall off, but
continue to grow during life, and re&s;emble, in
figure and texture, tho&s;e of the gazelles. He
re&s;embles the gazelles &s;till more in the figure of
his body, the lightne&s;s of his head, the length
of his neck, the po&s;ition of his eyes, ears, and
horns, and in the form and length of his tail.
The gentlemen of the Academy of Sciences, to
whom this animal was pre&s;ented under the name
of the <HI>Barbary cow,</HI> and who adopted that deno|mination,
have not failed to recogni&s;e it to be the
<HI>bubalus</HI> of the antients. Though we have re|jected
this compound appellation, we he&s;itate not
to copy here their exact de&s;cription, by which it
<PB N="5" REF="11">
appears that this animal is not a gazelle, a
goat, a cow, an elk, or a &s;tag<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">The bubalus is &s;eparated from the &s;tag-kind by two e&s;|&s;ential characters: 1. The horns never &s;hed; 2. The bubalus has a gall-bladder, which is wanting in the &s;tag, the fallow-deer, the roebuck, &amp;c. &startq;The gall-bladder,&endq; &s;ay the gentlemen of the academy, &startq;was placed on the right &s;ide; its internal half was attached to the liver, and the membrane which formed the external half was thin, delicate, and folded, being entirely void of gall;&endq; <HI>Mem. pour &s;ervir &agrave; l'hi&s;t. des ani|maux, part. 2. p.</HI> 29.</NOTE>, but that it is a

<P>In the Royal Cabinet there is, 1. A &s;keleton
of the bubalus, which had been de&s;cribed and
di&s;&s;ected by the gentlemen of the Academy;
2. A head, which is much larger than that of
the &s;keleton, and the horns are al&s;o thicker
<PB N="7" REF="13">
and longer; 3. A portion of another head, with
horns as large as the former, but who&s;e figure
and direction are different. Hence in the bu|bali,
as well as in the gazelles, antilopes, &amp;c.
there are varieties in the &s;ize of the body and
the figure of the horns. But the&s;e differences
&s;eem to be too incon&s;iderable to con&s;titute di|&s;tinct

<P>The bubalus is very common in Barbary, and
in all the northern parts of Africa. He has
nearly the &s;ame di&s;po&s;itions with the antilopes;

<P>THE Marquis de Marigny, who never lo&s;es
an opportunity of encouraging arts and
&s;ciences, &s;howed me in his cabinet the head of
an animal, which, at fir&s;t &s;ight, I took to be
that of a large bubalus. It re&s;embles the head
<PB N="9" REF="15">
of our large&s;t &s;tags. But, in&s;tead of &s;olid
horns, like tho&s;e of the &s;tag, it had two large,
hollow horns, with a ridge like tho&s;e of the he-goat,
and a double flexion, like tho&s;e of the an|tilopes.
In &s;earching the royal cabinet, I found
two horns which belonged to this animal. The
fir&s;t had been brought from the King's wardrobe,
without any title or name. The &s;econd I had
from M. Baurhis, commi&s;&s;ary of the navy, un|der
the name of the <HI>Condoma</HI> of the Cape of
Good Hope; which name we have adopted,
becau&s;e the animal has not hitherto been de&s;cri|bed
or denominated.</P>
<P>From the length, thickne&s;s, and e&s;pecially the
double flexion of the horns, the condoma makes
a near approach to the <HI>Strep&s;iceros</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Strep&s;icerotis cornua tam graphice de&s;crip&s;it Plinius, at|que lyris tam appo&s;ite comparavit, ut longiore verborum ambitu opus non &s;it.

<PB N="10" REF="16">
The figure, and even all the dimen&s;ions of the
horns, are almo&s;t perfectly the &s;ame. From this
corre&s;pondence in the &s;ize and figure of the head
and horns, we may pre&s;ume that the condoma
and <HI>&s;trep&s;iceros</HI> of Caius are the &s;ame animal, e|&s;pecially
when the following reflections are at|tended
to: 1. Caius, it is obvious, was decei|ved,
when he made this animal the <HI>&s;trep&s;iceros</HI> of
the antients; for the <HI>&s;trep&s;iceros</HI> of the antients
is unque&s;tionably the <HI>antilope,</HI> who&s;e head is ve|ry
different from that of the &s;tag. Now Caius
tells us, that the head of his &s;trep&s;iceros re&s;em|bled
that of the &s;tag; and, therefore, it could
not be the &s;trep&s;iceros of the antients. 2. Caius's
animal, like the condoma, had thick horns, a|bove
three feet long, covered with rugo&s;ities, in|&s;tead
of rings or tubercles; but the horns of the
&s;trep&s;iceros of the antients, or <HI>antilope,</HI> are much
thinner and &s;horter, having both rings and tu|bercles.
3. Though the horns of the condoma in
the cabinet of the Marquis de Marigny, as well
as tho&s;e which were brought from the King's
wardrobe, had been poli&s;hed by friction, it is
ea&s;y to perceive that they never had rings. This
fact is farther demon&s;trated by the horn &s;ent to
me by M. Baurhis, which had never been touch|ed,
and yet it had only rugo&s;ities like the he|goat,
and no rings like the <HI>antilope.</HI> Now, Caius
him&s;elf tells us, that the horns of his &s;trep&s;iceros
had rugo&s;ities only. Hence this &s;trep&s;iceros is
<PB N="11" REF="17">
not that of the antients, but the animal we are
here treating of, which po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es all the charac|ters
which Caius attributes to his.</P>
<P>In examining the writings of travellers, we
have found nothing that approaches &s;o near to
the genuine idea of this animal, which is &s;o
remarkable for its &s;ize, and particularly the
largene&s;s of its horns, as the quadruped men|tioned
by Kolbe under the denomination of
the <HI>wild-goat</HI> of the Cape of Good Hope.
&startq;This goat,&endq; &s;ays he, &startq;which has received no
name from the Hottentots, and which I
have called the <HI>wild-goat,</HI> is remarkable
in many re&s;pects. It is of the &s;ize of a
large &s;tag; its head is very beautiful, and a|dorned
with two &s;mooth horns, which are
bended and pointed. They are three feet in
length, and their extremities are two feet a|&s;under.&endq;
The&s;e characters &s;eem to corre&s;pond
exactly with the animal under con&s;ideration: But,
having &s;een the head only, we cannot be equal|ly
certain that the re&s;t of Kolbe's de&s;cription<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">From the front, and along the whole back as far as the tail, there is a white &s;tripe; another, of the $ame colour &s;urrounds the lower part of the neck; other two of the &s;ame kind &s;urround the body, the one behind the fore-legs, and the other before the hind-legs. The hair on the re&s;t of the body is gray, with &s;ome reddi&s;h &s;pots, except that on the belly, which is white. The beard is gray and very long.

<P>THIS animal, though not taken notice of
by any naturali&s;t or traveller, is very com|mon
in Senegal, from which M. Adan&s;on brought
a &s;kin of it, and pre&s;ented it to the royal cabinet.
It re&s;embles the gazelles, and particularly the
nanguer, in the &s;ize and figure of the body, in
the lightne&s;s of the limbs, in the form of the
head and muzzle, in the eyes and ears, and in
the length of the tail and the want of a beard.
But all the gazelles, and e&s;pecially the nanguers,
have their bellies of a fine white colour; while
the brea&s;t and belly of the guib are of a deep
che&s;nut. It differs likewi&s;e from the gazelles by
its horns, which are &s;mooth, without tran&s;ver&s;e
rings, and have two longitudinal ribs, the one
above and the other below, forming a &s;piral

<P>THIS animal is known to the naturali&s;ts
by the appellation of the <HI>Grimm goat</HI> only,
which, as we are ignorant of the name given it
in its native country, we &s;hall adopt. There is

which has been copied in the Academy Collec|tion<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Collect. Academ. tom. 3 pl. 26.</NOTE>.
Dr Herman Grimm was the fir&s;t who

<PB N="15" REF="22">
by all the nomenclators. Though his de|&s;cription

It was of an ob&s;cure a&s;h-colour. On the top of its head there was a tuft of erect hairs; and, between each eye and no&s;trils, a cavity filled with a yellowi&s;h humour, which was oily and vi&s;cid, and, when expo&s;ed to the air, became black and hard: This &s;ub&s;tance, the odour of which partici|pates both of ca&s;tor and mu&s;k, renews &s;ucce&s;&s;ively after the cavities are emptied. I was a&s;&s;ured that the cavities had no communication with the eyes, and that the thick humour they contained was different from that collected in the large angle of the eyes of &s;tags and &s;everal other animals; <HI>Ephem. des curieux de la Nature, decad. 2. ann. 4. 1686. Ob&s;. 57. Collection Academique, Dijon, tom. 3. p. 696. tab.</HI> 26.</NOTE>, he points out two cha|racters
&s;o remarkable, that we ea&s;ily recogni&s;ed a
head of a Senegal animal, &s;ent us by M. Adan|&s;on,
to belong to the grimm. The fir&s;t is an e|normous
cavity below each eye, which pene|trates
&s;o deep as to leave only a thin plate of
bone between each cavity and the partition of
the no&s;e: The &s;econd is a bu&s;hy tuft of hair re|flected
backward on the top of the head. The&s;e
characters &s;ufficiently di&s;tingui&s;h the grimm from
all the other goats or gazelles. It has, however,
a re&s;emblance to both, not only in the form of
the body, but even in the horns, which are an|nulated
toward the ba&s;e, furrowed longitudinally,
like tho&s;e of the gazelles, and, at the &s;ame time,
directed horizontally backward, and very &s;hort,
like tho&s;e of the &s;mall African goat, formerly
mentioned. Be&s;ides, this animal being much
<PB N="16" REF="23">
&s;maller than the goats, gazelles, &amp;c. and having
very &s;hort horns, &s;eems to con&s;titute the &s;hade
between the goats and the <HI>chevrotains,</HI> or &s;mall
antilopes.</P>
<P>In the &s;pecies of the grimm, the males alone
appear to have horns; for the individual de&s;cri|bed
and engraved by Dr Grimm had no horns;
and the head given us by M. Adan&s;on had two
&s;hort horns nearly concealed among the hair,
though &s;till apparent enough to be &s;een by the
drawer: Be&s;ides, in the hi&s;tory of the <HI>chevrotains,</HI>
or &s;mall antilopes, we will find, that, in the
royal or Guinea antilope, the male alone has
horns; which makes it probable that the &s;ame is
the ca&s;e with the grimm &s;pecies, which is more
allied to the &s;mall antilopes than to any other
animal.</P>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>SUPPLEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>Me&s;&s;. Vo&s;ma&euml;r and Pallas have given de&s;crip|tions
of this beautiful animal, and a good figure
of it, which we have here copied. It is worthy
of remark, that the horns of the grimm, pre|&s;erved
in the Royal Cabinet, bend a little for|ward
at their points; while tho&s;e de&s;cribed by
Vo&s;ma&euml;r and Pallas bend a little backward. The
ears of the former are round at the extremities;
<PB N="17" REF="24">
but tho&s;e of the latter terminate in a point. Is
this a natural variety, or an error in the draw|ing?
Vo&s;ma&euml;r and Pallas's grimm has the point
of the no&s;e black, a black band extending from
the no&s;e along the chanfrin, and ending at the
tuft of hair placed on the top of the front. The
head in the Royal Cabinet has not this band.
The&s;e &s;light differences, however, are not &s;uffi|cient
to con&s;titute di&s;tinct &s;pecies.</P>
<P>M. Vo&s;ma&euml;r calls this animal the <HI>&s;mall beau|tiful
buck</HI> of Guinea, probably on account of
its elegance. But I &s;hall retain the name of
<HI>grimm;</HI> becau&s;e, under that appellation, it is
known to all the naturali&s;ts.</P>
<P>&startq;This animal,&endq; M. Vo&s;ma&euml;r remarks, &startq;was a
male, and one of the mo&s;t beautiful and delicate
creatures I ever &s;aw. It was &s;ent from Guinea
to Holland along with thirteen others of the
&s;ame &s;pecies, and of both &s;exes. Twelve of
them died during the voyage, and in this num|ber
were all the females; &s;o that there remain|ed
alive only two males, which were put
into the menagerie of the Prince of Orange,
where one of them died in the winter 1764.
According to our information, the females have
no horns. The&s;e animals are extremely timid.
Any noi&s;e, and particularly thunder, terrifies
them. When &s;urpri&s;ed, they expre&s;s their
fear by blowing &s;uddenly and with great force
through their no&s;e.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="25">
&startq;The one which is &s;till alive (in 1766) was
at fir&s;t wild; but has now become pretty tame.
It li&s;tens when called by its name <HI>Tetje,</HI> and,
when gently approached, with a piece of bread
in the hand, it allows its head and neck to be
&s;troaked. It is &s;o cleanly, that it &s;uffers not
the &s;malle&s;t particle of dirt to remain on any
part of its body; for this purpo&s;e, it often
&s;cratches it&s;elf with one of its hind feet. This
is the rea&s;on why it has received the appella|tion
of <HI>Tetje,</HI> from <HI>Tettig,</HI> which &s;ignifies
<HI>neat</HI> or <HI>clean.</HI> However, if a per&s;on continues
for &s;ome time to rub its body, a white powder
adheres to his fingers, like that which proceeds
from hor&s;es when they are curried.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;This animal is extremely agile; and, when
repo&s;ing, it frequently keeps one of its fore-feet
in an elevated and bended po&s;ition, which gives
it a very agreeable appearance. It is fed with
bread, rye, and carrots: It likewi&s;e &s;pontane|ou&s;ly
eats potatoes. It is a ruminating animal,
and di&s;charges its excrements in &s;mall balls,
the &s;ize of which is con&s;iderable in propor|tion
to the magnitude of the creature.&endq;</P>
<P>Dr Herman Grimm tells us, that the fat, vi&s;|cid,
yellow humour, which is &s;ecreted in the
cavities above the eyes of this animal, has an
odour that participates of mu&s;k and ca&s;toreum.
M. Vo&s;ma&euml;r remarks, that, in his live &s;ubject,
this vi&s;cid matter had no odour of any kind;
and that the figure given by Grimm is extreme|ly
<PB N="19" REF="26">
erroneous; for it repre&s;ents a tuft of hair on the
fore-head, which has no exi&s;tence; and his
&s;ubject, which was a female, had no horns;
&startq;But ours,&endq; continues M. Vo&s;ma&euml;r, &startq;is a male,
and has large horns in proportion to its &s;ize:
And, in&s;tead of this high, erect tuft of hair,
it had only a &s;mall quantity, which ro&s;e a
little to a point between the horns. It is a|bout
the &s;ize of a kid of two months old;&endq;
(though it was probably three or four years of
age; becau&s;e it was &s;ent from Guinea before
the winter 1764, and M. Vo&s;ma&euml;r publi&s;hed
his de&s;cription of it in the year 1767.) &startq;Its
limbs are fine, and well &s;uited to its body. Its
head is beautiful, and pretty much re&s;embles
that of a roebuck. The eye is lively and full
of fire. The no&s;e is black and naked, but al|ways
moi&s;t. The no&s;trils are &s;haped like a
long cre&s;cent. The edges of the muzzle are
black. The upper lip, though not divided,
has the appearance of being &s;eparated into two
lobes. There is no hair on the chin; but, a
little higher, there are, on each &s;ide, a kind of
&s;mall whi&s;kers; and, under the throat, a &s;ort
of wart garni&s;hed with hair,&endq; (which brings
this animal &s;till nearer to the goat-kind, mo&s;t of
whom have &s;imilar warts or excre&s;cences on
their throats).</P>
<P>&startq;The tongue is rather round than oblong or
pointed.... The horns are black, finely fur|rowed
from top to bottom, and about three
<PB N="20" REF="27">
inches in length: They are perfectly &s;traight,
and terminate in a very &s;harp point. At the
ba&s;e, they are nearly three quarters of an inch
thick; and they are ornamented with three
rings, which ri&s;e a little backward.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;The hairs on the front are &s;traighter than the
others; and, at the origin of the horns, they are
coar&s;e, gray, and cri&s;ped. Between the horns,
the hair is more erect, and forms a kind of
pointed black tuft, from which a &s;tripe of the
&s;ame colour de&s;cends and lo&s;es it&s;elf in the
no&s;e.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;The ears are large, and have, on the out&s;ide,
three cavities or depre&s;&s;ions, directed from the
top to the bottom. Internally, and at the &s;um|mit,
the ears are garni&s;hed with white, &s;hort
hair: The re&s;t of the ears are naked and black.
The eyes are pretty large, and of a deep brown
colour. The hair on the eye-lids is black,
clo&s;e, and long, e&s;pecially on the upper eye-lid.
Above the eyes there are &s;ome long hairs; but
they are thinly di&s;per&s;ed.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;On both &s;ides, between the eyes and no&s;e,
we &s;ee tho&s;e remarkable cavities by which this
animal is ea&s;ily di&s;tingui&s;hed. The&s;e parts are
naked and black. In the middle, a cavity or
depre&s;&s;ion appears, which is &s;omewhat callous,
and always moi&s;t. A &s;mall quantity of a vi&s;|cid,
gummy humour, di&s;tills from it, which
&s;oon hardens, and becomes black. The ani|mal

black on the &s;takes of his lodge, as if it had
been wiped off. With regard to the odour,
mentioned by Dr Grimm and his followers,
I could never di&s;cover it.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;The under part of the neck, which is mo|derately
long, is covered with pretty coar&s;e
hair, of a yellowi&s;h gray colour, like that of the
head. But the throat and upper part of the
neck is white.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;The hair on the body is black and &s;tiff,
though it be &s;oft to the touch. That on the
anterior parts is of a fine bright gray colour;
farther back it is a bright brown; toward the
belly it is gray; and, lower down, it is per|fectly
white.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;The legs are extremely &s;lender, and blacki&s;h
near the hoofs. The anterior parts of the fore|feet,
as far as the knees, are adorned with a
black band. They have no heels; but, in

feet are cloven, and provided with beautiful,

<P>THE name <HI>Chevrotain (Tragulus)</HI> has been
applied to tho&s;e &s;mall animals of the
warm regions of Africa and A&s;ia, which are
mentioned by almo&s;t every traveller under the
denomination of the <HI>&s;mall &s;tag,</HI> or the <HI>&s;mall hind.</HI>
They, indeed, re&s;emble the &s;tag in the figure of
the muzzle, in lightne&s;s of body, in the form of
the limbs, and in the &s;hortne&s;s of the tail. But
they differ from him prodigiou&s;ly in &s;ize, the
large&s;t not exceeding the magnitude of a hare.
Be&s;ides, &s;ome of them want horns entirely; and,
in tho&s;e which have horns, they are hollow, an|nulated,
and pretty &s;imilar to tho&s;e of the ga|zelles.
Their &s;mall cloven foot has al&s;o a great|er
re&s;emblance to the foot of the gazelle than to
that of the &s;tag; and their want of pits, or de|pre&s;&s;ions
under the eyes, removes them equally
from the gazelles and the &s;tags. In this article
they approach the goats: But, in fact, they are
neither &s;tags, gazelles, nor goats, but con&s;titute

who&s;e hair is much longer, and of a deeper
yellow colour, &s;eems to be only a variety of the
<PB N="25" REF="33">
fir&s;t kind. The fourth, which Seba mentions
as a native of Surinam, appears to be a &s;econd
variety of this &s;pecies, which is found in Africa,
but not in the &s;outhern regions of A&s;ia; and I
am inclined to think, that Seba has been ill in|formed,
when he tells us, that this animal came
from Surinam. All voyagers mention the&s;e
&s;mall &s;tags or chevrotains, as being found in Se|negal,
Guiney, and the Ea&s;t-Indies; but no tra|veller
affirms that he has &s;een them in Ameri|ca.
If Seba's &s;potted chevrotain really came
from Surinam, we mu&s;t pre&s;ume that it had been
tran&s;ported from Guiney, or &s;ome other &s;outh|ern
region of the Old World. But there &s;eems
to be a &s;econd &s;pecies of chevrotain, different
from all tho&s;e we have mentioned, which are
only &s;imple varieties of the fir&s;t. This &s;econd
&s;pecies has horns, which are only an inch in
length, and as much in circumference. The&s;e
&s;mall horns are hollow, black, a little bended,
very &s;harp at the points, and &s;urrounded at the
ba&s;e with three or four tran&s;ver&s;e rings. In
the King's cabinet, we have the feet of this ani|mal,
and one of its horns; and the&s;e parts de|mon&s;trate,
that it is either a chevrotain, or a
very minute gazelle. Kolbe, when mentioning
this &s;pecies, &s;ays, that its horns were &s;imilar to
tho&s;e of the &s;tag, and that they have branches
in proportion to their age<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">In Congo, Viga, Guiney, and other places near the Cape of Good Hope, we find a &s;pecies of goat which I call the <HI>Congo goat.</HI> It is not larger than a hare; but its beauty and &s;ymmetry are truly admirable. Its horns re&s;emble tho&s;e of the &s;tag, and have al&s;o branches in proportion to their age. Its legs are very hand&s;ome, and &s;o &s;mall, that the inferior part of them is often u&s;ed as a tobacco &s;topper. They are mounted with gold or &s;ilver; <HI>De&s;cript. du Cap de Bonne-e&s;pe|rance, par Kolbe, tom. 3. p.</HI> 39.</NOTE>. This is an evident
<PB N="26" REF="34">
blunder, as appears from a bare in&s;pection of
the horns them&s;elves.</P>
<P>The figure of the&s;e animals is elegant, and
their members are finely proportioned to their
&s;ize. They make prodigious bounds; but it is
probable that they cannot run long; for the In|dians
overtake them in the cour&s;e<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">The inhabitants of a &s;mall i&s;land near Java bring hinds of the &s;ize of a hare, which the Indians take in the cour&s;e; <HI>Voyage de la Gentil, tom. 3. p. 73. et p.</HI> 93. There is &s;till an|other kind of little quadrupeds. They are extremely hand|&s;ome; their horns are black, and their legs, though propor|tioned to the &s;ize of their bodies, are &s;o &s;lender, that &s;ome of them exceed not, in thickne&s;s, the &s;talk of a tobacco-pipe.

We mu&s;t, therefore, conclude, that there
are only two known &s;pecies of chevrotains, the
memina, or Indian kind, without horns, and the
guevei or chevrotain of Guiney, with horns;
that the five &s;pecies of Seba are only varieties of
the memina; and that the &s;malle&s;t kind, called
<HI>Guevei-kaior</HI> in Senegal, is only a variety of the
guevei.</P>
<P>None of the&s;e &s;mall animals can &s;ub&s;i&s;t, ex|cept
in very warm climates. They are &s;o ex|tremely
delicate, that it is with the utmo&s;t dif|ficulty
they can be tran&s;ported alive into Europe,
where they &s;oon peri&s;h. They are gentle, fa|miliar,
and mo&s;t beautifully &s;haped. Beyond all
compari&s;on, they are the &s;malle&s;t cloven-footed
animals. From this la&s;t character, they &s;hould
produce but few young at a litter. From their
<PB N="29" REF="37">
minutene&s;s, on the contrary, they ought to bring
$orth a great number. On this &s;ubject, we mu&s;t
wait for information from tho&s;e who have an
opportunity of ob&s;erving their oeconomy. We
imagine that they bring forth but one or two at
a time, like the gazelles, roe-deer, &amp;c. But
perhaps they produce more frequently; for
they are very numerous in India, Java, Ceylon,
Senegal, Congo, and in all the very warm coun|tries;
and none of them are found in America,
or in any of the temperate regions of the Old
Continent.</P>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>SUPPLEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>We have here added the figure of a chevrotain,
which differs from that in the original work;
where it was remarked, that the &s;kin of the
chevrotain is variegated with white &s;pots, and
that Seba maintained that it was found in Suri|nam.
It exi&s;ts not, however, in America, but
in the Ea&s;t Indies, where it is called <HI>Memina.</HI>
Under this denomination, we received the &s;kin
of a chevrotain from Ceylon, which had a per|fect
re&s;emblance to the de&s;cription we had
given of it. By comparing this with our ori|ginal
figure, we will perceive that none of the&s;e
animals have horns, and that they are both va|rieties

of America; that there were no goats or ga|zelles
in the New World before it was di&s;co|vered,
but that all tho&s;e which are now there,
were tran&s;ported thither from the Old Conti|nent;
that the true mazame of Mexico is the
&s;ame animal with the Bra&s;ilian cuguacu-apara;

and that, by a corruption, this animal was call|ed
<HI>cariacou</HI> in Cayenne, from which it was
tran&s;mitted to us alive, under the denomination
of <HI>cariacou.</HI> We &s;hall now endeavour to inve|&s;tigate
the &s;pecies of the two animals to which
Seba has fal&s;ely applied the names <HI>mazame</HI> and
<HI>temama&ccedil;ame;</HI> for, to de&s;troy an error, it is not
enough to reject it; but its cau&s;e and effects mu&s;t
al&s;o be exhibited.</P>
<P>The gazelles and chevrotains inhabit only the
warme&s;t countries of the Old World. They
cannot &s;ub&s;i&s;t in temperate, and far le&s;s in cold
climates. Hence they could never frequent the
northern regions, nor pa&s;s, by means of the&s;e
regions, from the one Continent to the other.
No travellers, accordingly, or hi&s;torians of the
New World ever pretend to have &s;een gazelles
or chevrotains in that quarter of the globe. The
&s;tag and roebuck, on the contrary, are natives
of cold and temperate climates. They might,
therefore, pa&s;s, by means of the northern lands,
and, accordingly, they are found in both Con|tinents.
In the hi&s;tory of the &s;tag, it was
<PB N="35" REF="43">
&s;hown<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">See vol. IV. article <HI>Stag.</HI></NOTE>, that the Canadian &s;tag is the &s;ame with
the European; and that he is only &s;maller, and
has &s;ome trifling variations in the figure of his
horns and the colour of his hair. We may add
to what was then related, that there are as many
varieties among the American as among the
European &s;tags; and yet they are all of the &s;ame
&s;pecies. Of one of the&s;e varieties, namely, the
Cor&s;ican &s;tag, we have given a figure<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See vol. IV. plate LII.</NOTE>. It is

than the former; but, in other re&s;pects,
they perfectly re&s;emble each other, and both

have palmated horns. The mazame of Mexico,
the cuguacu-apara of Bra&s;il, and the cariacou, or
wood-hind, of Cayenne, have an entire re&s;em|blance
to our red roebucks. To be convinced
that all the&s;e nams denote the &s;ame animal, we
have only to compare the de&s;criptions given un|der
them. But the temama&ccedil;ame, which, in our
opinion, is the cuguacu-&eacute;t&eacute; of Bra&s;il, the &s;mall
cariacou or Savannah hind of Cayenne, may
be only a variety different from tho&s;e of Europe.
The temama&ccedil;ame is &s;maller, and has al&s;o a whi|ter
belly, than the mazame, in the &s;ame manner
as our brown roebuck is &s;maller, and has a whi|ter
belly than the red kind. It appears likewi&s;e
to differ from the mazame in its horns, which
are &s;imple, and without antlers, in the figure
given by Recchi. But, if it be con&s;idered, that,
in our roebucks and &s;tags, the horns have no
antlers during the fir&s;t and &s;ometimes the &s;econd
year of their age, we will be led to believe that
Recchi's temama&ccedil;ame was too young to have
antlers. Hence the&s;e two animals &s;eem to be
only varieties of the roebuck &s;pecies, which will
be &s;till farther apparent from comparing the fi|gures
and de&s;criptions of the different authors
we have quoted, with the figure here given of
a cariacou which was &s;ent us from Cayenne, and
which we nouri&s;hed in Burgundy for &s;everal
years.</P>
<P>It now remains to inve&s;tigate the two animals
exhibited by Seba under the fal&s;e appellations
<PB N="38" REF="46">
of <HI>mazame</HI> and <HI>temama&ccedil;ame.</HI> The bare in&s;pec|tion
of the figures, independent of his de&s;crip|tion,
which we have in&s;erted above in the notes,
&s;how that the&s;e animals belong to the goats or
gazelles, and by no means to the &s;tages or roebucks.
The want of a beard, and the figure of the horns,
prove that they are not goats, but gazelles; and,
by comparing Seba's figures with the gazelles I
have de&s;cribed, I di&s;covered, that his pretended
<HI>temama&ccedil;ame of New Spain</HI> is the <HI>Kob,</HI> or <HI>&s;mall
brown cow of Senegal.</HI> The figure, colour, and
&s;ize of the horns are the &s;ame. The colour of
the hair, which differs from other gazelles, by
being yellow, in&s;tead of white, on the belly and
flanks, is al&s;o the &s;ame. With regard to his
pretended <HI>mazame,</HI> though it has a general re|&s;emblance
to the gazelles, it differs remarkably
from all tho&s;e we have formerly enumerated.
But we have found, in the cabinet of M. Adan|&s;on,
which contains the rare&s;t productions of
Senegal, a &s;tuffed animal, which we called <HI>Nagor,</HI>

<P>THE cla&s;s of ruminating quadrupeds is the
mo&s;t numerous, and the mo&s;t diver&s;ified.
It comprehends, as we have &s;een, a great num|ber
of &s;pecies, and perhaps a &s;till greater num|ber
of di&s;tinct races, or permanent varieties.
Notwith&s;tanding all our re&s;earches, and the la|borious
details into which we have been obliged
to enter, we freely acknowledge that the &s;ub|ject
is by no means exhau&s;ted, and that there
&s;till remain animals of con&s;iderable note which
we know only by imperfect fragments, and are un|able
to a&s;certain the creatures to which they be|long.
For example, in the very large collection
of horns pre&s;erved in the royal cabinet, as well
<PB N="41" REF="52">
as in private mu&s;eums, each of which, after
much labour and inve&s;tigation, we have refer|red
to the animal to whom it belongs, except
one, which, having neither ticket nor any o|ther
artificial mark of information, is ab&s;olutely
unknown. This horn is very large, almo&s;t
&s;traight, and compo&s;ed of a thick, black &s;ub|&s;tance.
It is not &s;olid, like that of the &s;tag; but
it is a hollow horn, filled with a bone or core,
like the horns of oxen. A thick rib, rai&s;ed a|bout
an inch, runs from the ba&s;e to above the
middle of the horn. Though the horn be
&s;traight, this prominent rib makes a &s;piral turn
and a half in the inferior part, and is entirely ef|faced
in the &s;uperior part, which terminates in
a point. Upon the whole, this horn &s;eems to
have a greater relation to tho&s;e of the buffalo
than to any other. But we are ignorant of the
name of the animal; and it was not till lately,
that, in &s;earching different cabinets, we found,
in that of M. Duplex, a fragment of a head
with two &s;imilar horns, to which the following
ticket was fixed: <HI>&startq;Horns of an animal &s;omewhat
like a hor&s;e, of a grayi&s;h colour, with a mane
on the fore part of the head like a hor&s;e. It is
called here (at Pondicherry) Coe&s;does, which
&s;hould be pronounced</HI> Coudous.&endq; This little
di&s;covery gave us great joy. We could not,
however, find the name <HI>coe&s;does</HI> or coudous, in
the writings of any voyager. We learned from
the ticket alone, that this animal is very large,
<PB N="42" REF="53">
and that he is a native of the warme&s;t countries
of A&s;ia. The buffalo belongs to the &s;ame cli|mate,
and has al&s;o a mane on the top of his head.
His horns, it is true, are crooked and flat, while
tho&s;e under con&s;ideration are round and &s;traight,
which, as well as the colour, &s;ufficiently di&s;tin|gui&s;hes
the&s;e two animals; for the &s;kin and the
hair of the buffalo are black, and, according to
the ticket, the hair of the coudous is grayi&s;h.
The&s;e relations &s;ugge&s;ted others: The travellers
into A&s;ia mention large buffaloes of Bengal,
reddi&s;h buffaloes, and grayi&s;h buffaloes of the
Mogul empire<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">In the hunting of the nil-gauts or gray oxen, which, in my opinion, are a &s;pecies of elk, there is nothing particular, &amp;c.; <HI>Voyage de Bernier, tom. 2. p.</HI> 245.</NOTE>, called <HI>nil-gauts.</HI> The coudous
is perhaps one or other of the&s;e animals. From
the travellers into Africa, where the buffaloes
are as common as in A&s;ia, we have more point|ed
information with regard to a &s;pecies of buf|falo
called <HI>paca&s;&s;e</HI> in Congo, which &s;eems to be
the coudous: &startq;Upon the route from Louanda
to the kingdom of Congo, we perceived<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Relation de Congo par les P. P. Michel-Ange de Gal|line &amp; Denys de Charly de Plai&s;ance, Capucins, p. 77.</NOTE> two
paca&s;&s;es, which are animals re&s;embling buffa|loes,
and roar like lions. The male and fe|male
go always in company. They are white,
with red and black &s;pots. Their ears are
half an ell long, and their <HI>horns are entirely
&s;traight.</HI> When they &s;ee any per&s;on, they
neither fly nor do any harm, but &s;tare at the
<PB N="43" REF="54">
pa&s;&s;engers.&endq; We formerly remarked, that the
animal called <HI>empaca&s;&s;a,</HI> or <HI>paca&s;&s;a,</HI> in Congo<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">The country of Congo produces another animal which the natives call <HI>empaca&s;&s;a.</HI> Some people think it is the buf|falo, and others that it has only a great re&s;emblance to that animal. The editor of Lopes's Account tells us, that it is not &s;o large as a buffalo, but that it re&s;embles him in the head and neck.&mdash;Dapper a&s;&s;ures us, that the buffalo is called <HI>empaca&s;&s;a</HI> in the kingdom of Congo, and that its hair is red, and its horns black; <HI>Hi&s;t. gen. des voyages, tom. 5. p.</HI> 81.</NOTE>,
appeared to be the buffalo. It is in fact a
&s;pecies of buffalo, differing from him in the
figure of the horns and colour of the hair. In
a word, the paca&s;&s;a is the coudous, which per|haps
con&s;titutes a different &s;pecies from that
of the buffalo, and perhaps is only a variety
of it.</P>

We may be a&s;&s;ured, however, that its &s;pecies is
di&s;tinct, and different from all the other qua|drupeds.
It is of the &s;ize of a &s;mall roebuck;
but has no horns. By this character, it re&s;em|bles
the <HI>memina</HI> or Indian mu&s;k. It has two
large tu&s;ks in the upper jaw, by which it ap|proaches
to the Guiney mu&s;k. But, what di|&s;tingui&s;hes
the mu&s;k from all other animals, is a
kind of bag near its navel, about two or three
inches in diameter, in which the liquor, or ra|ther
fat humour called <HI>mu&s;k,</HI> is &s;eparated, and
which differs both in odour and con&s;i&s;tence from
that of the civet. Neither the Greeks nor Ro|mans
mention this animal. It was fir&s;t taken
notice of by the Arabians<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Abu&s;&s;eid Serafi remarks, that the mu&s;k animal re&s;embles the roebuck in the &s;kin and colour, in the &s;lenderne&s;s of the legs, in the hoofs, in the <HI>erect and &s;omewhat bended horns;</HI> and that it is armed with two white tu&s;ks on the &s;ide of each cheek. This author is &s;ingle in a&s;&s;erting that the mu&s;k animal has horns; he has perhaps conjectured from ana|logy, that, as it re&s;embled the roebuck in other re&s;pects, it ought likewi&s;e to have horns.

Having never been able to procure the animal
<PB N="49" REF="60">
it&s;elf, we are reduced to the nece&s;&s;ity of collec|ting
and dige&s;ting what has been &s;aid of it by
others. From Grew's de&s;cription, which is the
only authentic work we are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of, it appears
that this animal has long coar&s;e hair, a &s;harp
muzzle, and tu&s;ks like tho&s;e of a hog; and that,
by the&s;e characters, it approaches the wild boar,
or rather the <HI>babirou&s;&s;a,</HI> called the <HI>wild Indian
boar</HI> by the naturali&s;ts, which, along with &s;e|veral
characters of the hog, is, like the mu&s;k a|nimal,
&s;maller, and has taller and more nimble
limbs, re&s;embling tho&s;e of the &s;tag or roebuck.
On the other hand, the American hog, which
we have called <HI>pecari,</HI> has on his back a cavity
or pur&s;e which contains an odoriferous humour;
and the mu&s;k animal has a &s;imilar pur&s;e, not
on his back, but under his belly. In general,
none of tho&s;e animals which produce odorous
liquors, as the badger, the beaver, the pecari,
the mu&s;k rats, and the civet, belong to the genus
of deer or goats. Hence we would be led to
think, that the mu&s;k animal makes a nearer ap|proach
to the hog-kind<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Animal mo&s;chi&s;erum neque e cervino neque e caprino genere e&s;&s;e videtur; cornua enim non habet, et an ruminet incertum e&s;t; dentibus tamen inci&s;oribus in &s;uperiore mandi|bula caret ruminantium in modum, et dentes ibidem exertos habet, (<HI>Tu&s;ks</HI> Anglice, <HI>defen&s;es</HI> Gallice,) velut porcus; <HI>Raii Syn. quad. p.</HI> 127.</NOTE>, of which he has the

particularly with the chevrotain, which chews
the cud, though it has no horns. All the&s;e exter|nal
characters, however, furni&s;h us with con|jectures
only. But an examination of the in|ternal
parts can alone decide concerning the na|ture
of this animal, which to this day is very
little known. I have made it follow the goats
and antilopes, not becau&s;e it &s;eems to have any

too much offend the prejudices of mo&s;t natu|rali&s;ts.</P>
<P>Marco Paolo, Barbo&s;a, and P. Philippe the Ma|rini,
are all more or le&s;s deceived in the notices
they have given concerning this animal.<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Paolo de&s;cribes it in this manner. Its hair is coar&s;e, like that of the &s;tag: It has the feet and tail of a gazelle, and no horns <HI>any more than that animal.</HI> It has <HI>four</HI> teeth in the upper jaw, about three inches long, which are as de|licate and white as ivory; two of them ri&s;e upward, and two turn downward; and the creature is exceedingly beautiful. During <HI>the full moon,</HI> it is affected with an impo&s;thume on the belly near the navel; and at this time the hunters &s;eize the animal, and open this impo&s;thume. Barbo&s;a &s;ays, that it is very like the gazelle; but he agrees not with other au|thors, when he tells us that its hair is white. The follow|ing are his words: &startq;The <HI>mu&s;k</HI> is found in &s;mall white animals which re&s;emble gazelles, and have tu&s;ks like elephants, though much &s;maller. A kind of impo&s;thume forms under the belly and brea&s;t of the&s;e animals, and, when the matter is ripe, the tumour grows &s;o itchy, that they rub it again&s;t the trees: The matter which falls down in &s;mall grains is the mo&s;t per|fect <HI>mu&s;k.&endq;</HI> Thevenot's de&s;cription &s;eems to corre&s;pond &s;till better with the others. &startq;In the&s;e countries,&endq; &s;ays he, &startq;there is an animal with a muzzle &s;imilar to that of the fox, but who&s;e body exceeds not the &s;ize of a hare. His hair re&s;embles that of the &s;tag, and he has the teeth of a dog: He pro|duces excellent mu&s;k in a bladder under the belly, which is full of corrupted blood; and this blood compo&s;es, or rather is the mu&s;k it&s;elf. The natives cut away this bladder, and cover the cut part of it with leather, to prevent the di&s;&s;ipa|tion of the odour. But, after this operation, the animal &s;oon dies.&endq; The de&s;cription given by Pigafetta, who &s;ays that the mu&s;k is of the &s;ize of a cat, corre&s;ponds not with that of other authors; neither does that of P. Philippe, who makes the head of the mu&s;k re&s;emble the head of a wolf: And P. Kircher, in the figure he has given of this animal, re|pre&s;ents it with the &s;$out of a hog, which is perhaps an er|ror of the engraver, who has likewi&s;e given it claws in&s;tead of cloven hoofs. Simeon Sethi recedes &s;till farther from truth, when he makes the mu&s;k as large as an unicorn, and even a &s;pecies of it. &startq;The <HI>mu&s;k</HI> of lea&s;t value,&endq; &s;ays he, &startq;is brought from China and the Ea&s;t Indies, and is of a blacki&s;h colour. The <HI>mu&s;k</HI> is formed below the navel of a large ani|mal with one horn, and which has a re&s;emblance to the roe|buck. In the rutting &s;ea&s;on, a ma&s;s of clotted blood collects round his navel, and produces a &s;welling, the pain of which prevents him from eating or drinking: He then rolls him|&s;elf on the earth, breaks the tumour, and di&s;charges the blood, which, after coagulating, acquires a fine odour.&endq; All the&s;e authors agree in the manner in which the <HI>mu&s;k</HI> is formed in a bladder or tumour near the navel, when the ani|mal ruts; <HI>Anciennes relations des Indes &amp; de la Chine, p.</HI> 216.</NOTE>. The
<PB N="51" REF="62">
only fact in which they agree is, that the <HI>mu&s;k</HI>
is formed in a pouch or tumour near the navel;
and it appears from their te&s;timonies, as well
as tho&s;e of other travellers, that the male alone
produces the <HI>mu&s;k;</HI> that the female has the &s;ame
pouch near the navel, but that the humour &s;e|creted
in it has not the &s;ame odour; that this tu|mour
of the male is not filled with <HI>mu&s;k,</HI> except in
the rutting &s;ea&s;on; and that, at other times,
<PB N="52" REF="63">
the quantity of this humour is &s;maller, and its
odour weaker.</P>
<P>With regard to the <HI>mu&s;k</HI> it&s;elf, its e&s;&s;ence is
perhaps as little known as the nature of the
animal from which it is procured. All travel|lers
agree, that this drug is perpetually adultera|ted
with blood, or other drugs, by the venders.
The Chine&s;e not only augment its &s;ize by mix|ture,
but they endeavour to increa&s;e its weight
by incorporating finely powdered lead with it.
The <HI>mu&s;k</HI> which is pure&s;t, and in mo&s;t reque&s;t
among the Chine&s;e them&s;elves, is that which
drops &s;pontaneou&s;ly from the animal upon &s;tones
or trunks of trees, again&s;t which it rubs, when
the matter is too abundant, or begins to irritate
the pouch where it is formed: That found
in the pouch it&s;elf is &s;eldom &s;o good; becau&s;e it
is not fully ripe, or rather becau&s;e it is during
the rutting &s;ea&s;on only it acquires its greate&s;t
&s;trength and odour; and, at this period, the ani|mal
endeavours to get rid of a matter which is
too highly exalted, and occa&s;ions itching and
&s;ome degree of pain. Both Chardin<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">It is well known, that <HI>mu&s;k</HI> is the excrementitious matter of an animal which re&s;embles the wild goat, except that its body and limbs are more delicate. It is found in High Tar|tary, in the north of China, and in Tibet, which is a king|dom between India and China. I never &s;aw the&s;e animals a|live, but I have &s;een their &s;kins in many places. There are fi|gures of them in the Dutch amba&s;&s;ador's lodgings at China, and in the <HI>China illu&s;trata</HI> of Kircher. It is commonly &s;aid, that the <HI>mu&s;k</HI> is the &s;weat of the animal, which runs down and is collected in a thin bladder near the navel. But the na|tives of the Ea&s;t tell us with more preci&s;ion, that it is formed in an ab&s;ce&s;s within the body, and near the navel of this goat, the humour of which produces an itching and prickling pain, e&s;pecially when the animal is in &s;ea&s;on; that, by rubbing a|gain&s;t trees or rocks, the ab&s;ce&s;s bur&s;ts, and the matter is dif|fu&s;ed between the mu&s;cles and the &s;kin, where it collects and forms a kind of bli&s;ter or bladder; and that the internal heat exalts this corrupted blood, and gives it the &s;trong odour of <HI>mu&s;k.</HI> This bladder is called <HI>the navel of the mu&s;k,</HI> or <HI>the odori|ferous navel.</HI> The Ea&s;tern people prefer the Tibet <HI>mu&s;k</HI> to that of China, whether it is really a &s;tronger odour, or only ap|pears &s;o, becau&s;e it arrives to them fre&s;her, Tibet being near|er to them than the province of Xin&s;i, which produces more <HI>mu&s;k</HI> than any other di&s;trict of China. The great <HI>mu&s;k</HI> trade is carried on at Boutan, a celebrated town in the kingdom of Tibet. The Patans go there to purcha&s;e it; and they di&s;|tribute it over all India, from whence it is tran&s;ported through the whole earth. The Patans border on Per&s;ia and High Tar|tary, and are &s;ubject or rather tributary to the Great Mogul. The Indians make great u&s;e of this aromatic drug. They employ it in their perfumes, confections, and every compo&s;i|tion they have been accu&s;tomed to prepare for the purpo&s;es of provoking love, or of re&s;toring lo&s;t vigour. The women u&s;e it to di&s;&s;ipate the vapours which a&s;cend from the ute|rus to the brain; by fixing a bladder of it on their navel; and, when the vapours are violent and perpetual, they take the <HI>mu&s;k</HI> out of the bladder, tie it in a &s;mall linen bag, and apply it to a place which mode&s;ty permits not to be named.&mdash;It is commonly alledged, that, when the mu&s;k|bag is cut open, &s;o &s;trong an odour bur&s;ts out, that the hun|ter is obliged to have his mouth and no&s;e covered with &s;eve|ral folds of linen; and that, notwith&s;tanding this precaution, the force of the odour is often &s;o great as to produce a mor|tal haemorrhagy. I made a particular inquiry into this fact, and, having heard &s;imiliar accounts from &s;ome Armenians who had been at Boutan, I am inclined to think it is true; becau&s;e this drug, in&s;tead of acquiring, lo&s;es its odour in proce&s;s of time. Now this odour is &s;o &s;trong in India, that I was unable to bear it. When I dealt in <HI>mu&s;k,</HI> I &s;tood always in the open air, with a handkerchief on my face, and at a di&s;tance from tho&s;e who handled the bladders, and brought them to my broker. I then perceived that <HI>mu&s;k,</HI> when fre&s;h, is ex|tremely heady, and quite in&s;upportable. I &s;hall only add, that there is no drug &s;o ea&s;ily or &s;o frequently adulterated. Some bags are only pieces of the animal's &s;kin, filled with its blood, and a &s;mall quantity of <HI>mu&s;k</HI> to give it an odour, in&s;tead of that bladder formed by the wi&s;dom of Nature near the na|vel to receive this wonderful and odoriferous humour. With regard to the genuine bladders, when the hunters find that they are not full, they &s;queeze the animal's belly, and fill them with blood; for they believe that the blood of the mu&s;k, and even its fle&s;h, has a fine &s;cent. The merchants afterwards mix the <HI>mu&s;k</HI> with lead, ox's blood, and other &s;ub&s;tances pro|per for augmenting its weight. The Ea&s;tern people employ &s;everal modes of detecting this fal&s;ification, without opening the bag: They learn from experience to di&s;tingui&s;h the pro|per weight of an unadulte$ated bag. They likewi&s;e know by the ta&s;te. Hence the Indians never purcha&s;e <HI>mu&s;k</HI> without ta|&s;ting &s;mall grains of it, which they &s;queeze out of the bags. In fine, they take a thread &s;teeped in garlick juice, and draw it through the bag with a needle: If the odour of the gar|lick be extingui&s;hed, the <HI>mu&s;k</HI> is good, and if the thread pre|&s;erves the &s;cent of the garlick, the <HI>mu&s;k</HI> is adulterated; <HI>Voyage de Chardin, tom. 2. p.</HI> 16.</NOTE> and Ta|vernier

<P>After killing the animal, the pea&s;ants cut off the bag, which is of the &s;ize of an egg, and is &s;ituated nearer the or|gans of generation than the navel. They next take out the <HI>mu&s;k,</HI> which then has the appearance of clotted blood. When they want to adulterate it, they put a ma&s;h of the animal's liver and blood in the place of the mu&s;k they had extracted. In two or three years, this mixture produces certain &s;mall a|nimals which eat the good <HI>mu&s;k;</HI> &s;o that, when opened, a great defalcation is di&s;covered. Others, after extracting a portion of the mu&s;k, put in &s;mall pieces of lead, to augment the weight. The merchants who tran&s;port <HI>mu&s;k</HI> to foreign countries love this trick better than the other, becau&s;e none of the&s;e &s;mall animals are produced by it. But the deceit is &s;till wor&s;e to di&s;cover, when, of the &s;kin taken from the belly of a young animal they make little bags, which they &s;ew &s;o dexterou&s;ly with threads of the &s;ame &s;kin, that they re&s;emble genuine bags. The&s;e they fill with what they take out of the genuine bags, and &s;ome fraudulent mixture, which it is ex|tremely difficult for the merchants to detect. When the bags are fewed immediately upon their being cut, without allow|ing any part of the odour to di&s;&s;ipate in the air, after they have ab&s;tracted as much of the <HI>mu&s;k</HI> as they think proper, if a per&s;on applies one of the&s;e bags to his no&s;e, blood will be drawn by the mere force of the odour, which mu&s;t nece&s;|&s;arily be weakened or diluted, in order to render it agreeable, without injuring the brain. The odour of the animal I brought to Paris was &s;o &s;trong, that it was impo&s;&s;ible to keep it in my chamber. It made every head in the hou&s;e giddy; and I was obliged to put it in a barn, where my &s;ervants at la&s;t cut away the bag: The &s;kin, notwith&s;tanding, always retained a portion of the odour. The&s;e animals are not found in a lower latitude than the fifty &s;ixth degree. But in the &s;ixtieth they are very numerous, the country being full of woods. In the months of February and March, it is true, after &s;uffering much hunger in their favourite clime, on ac|count of the &s;now, which is &s;ometimes ten or twelve feet deep, they come &s;outhward as far as the forty-fourth or forty-fifth degree, in order to procure grain, or fre&s;h rice. During this period, the pea&s;ants lie in wait for the&s;e animals with &s;nares, and kill them with arrows and bludgeons.

<P>THOUGH we have only the head of this
animal in the Royal Cabinet, it is too re|markable
to be pa&s;&s;ed over in &s;ilence. All na|turali&s;ts
have regarded it as a &s;pecies of hog;
and yet it has neither the head, the &s;tature, the
bri&s;tles, nor the tail of a hog. Its legs are long|er,
and its muzzle &s;horter. It is covered with
&s;hort hair, as &s;oft as wool, and its tail terminates
<PB N="59" REF="70">
in a tuft. Its body, likewi&s;e, is neither &s;o heavy
nor &s;o thick as that of the hog. Its hair is gray,
mixed with red and a little black. Its ears are
&s;hort and pointed. But the mo&s;t remarkable
character, which di&s;tingui&s;hes the babirou&s;&s;a
fom all other animals, con&s;i&s;ts in four large
tu&s;ks or canine teeth, the two &s;horte&s;t of which
proceed, like tho&s;e of the wild boar, from the
under jaw, and the two longe&s;t, by piercing the
cheeks, or rather the lips, from the upper jaw,
and extend in a curve above the eyes. The&s;e
tu&s;ks are a beautiful ivory, which is cleaner and
finer, but not &s;o hard as that of the elephant.</P>
<P>The direction of the two &s;uperior tu&s;ks, which
fir&s;t ri&s;e high and then bend in the form of a
circle, induced &s;ome able natural philo&s;ophers,
&s;uch as Grew<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">On his upper jaw, he has two horns&mdash;<HI>Bartholine</HI> calls them teeth, yet are they not teeth, but <HI>horns;</HI> becau&s;e they are not, as all teeth, even the tu&s;ks of an <HI>elephant,</HI> fixed in the jaw, with their roots upward, but downward: And &s;o their <HI>alveoli</HI> are not open downward within the mouth, but upward upon the top of the &s;nout, &amp;c.; <HI>Grew's Mu&s;. Reg. &s;oc. p.</HI> 28.</NOTE>, to think, that the&s;e tu&s;ks ought
not to be regarded as teeth, but as horns. They
founded their opinion upon this circum&s;tance,
<PB N="60" REF="71">
that, in all animals, the &s;ockets of the teeth in
the upper jaw open downward; that, in the
babirou&s;&s;a, all the &s;ockets likewi&s;e open down|ward,
except tho&s;e of the two great tu&s;ks, which
open upward; and hence they conclude, that,
from this e&s;&s;ential character of the upper teeth,
the&s;e tu&s;ks, who&s;e &s;ockets open upward, cannot
be regarded as teeth, but as horns. The&s;e phi|lo&s;ophers,
however, were deceived. Po&s;ition
or direction are circum&s;tances by no means e&s;|&s;ential
to the exi&s;tence of an object. The&s;e
tu&s;ks, though &s;ituated in a manner oppo&s;ite to
that of other teeth, are &s;till teeth; the &s;ingulari|ty
of their direction cannot alter their nature,
or convert a true canine tooth into an ivory
horn.</P>
<P>The&s;e enormous quadruple tu&s;ks give this a|nimal
a formidable appearance; yet he is le&s;s
dangerous, perhaps, than our wild boar. They
go in herds, and have a &s;trong odour, which be|trays
them to the dogs, who often hunt them
with &s;ucce&s;s. They growl in a frightful man|ner
<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Mu&s;. Worm. p. 340. Pi&s;on. Apend. in Bont. p. 61.</NOTE>, and fight and defend them&s;elves with
their under tu&s;ks, the upper ones being rather
incommodious than &s;erviceable to them. Though
brutal and ferocious, they are ea&s;ily tamed; and
their fle&s;h, which is very good, corrupts in a
&s;hort time. As their hair is fine and their &s;kin
thin, they make little re&s;i&s;tance again&s;t the teeth
<PB N="61" REF="72">
of the dogs, who hunt them in preference to the
boar, and accompli&s;h their purpo&s;e with ea&s;e.
In order to re&s;t their head, or to &s;leep in a &s;tand|ing
po&s;ture, they hook their upper tu&s;ks to the
branches of trees<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">De&s;cript. des Indes Orient. par Franc. Valentin, tom. 3. p. 268.</NOTE>. This practice is common
to them and the elephant, which, to repo&s;e
without lying down, &s;upports its head by put|ing
the ends of its tu&s;ks into holes that it digs
for this purpo&s;e in the wall of its apartment<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See above, art. <HI>Elephant.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P>The babirou&s;&s;a differs likewi&s;e from the wild
boar in natural appetites. He feeds upon herbs
and the leaves of trees, and never enters the gardens
to devour pot-herbs: But the boar, even in
the &s;ame country, lives upon wild fruits and roots,
and often lays wa&s;te the gardens. Be&s;ides, the&s;e
animals, which go equally in herds, never inter|mix;
the wild boars keep to one &s;ide, and the
babirou&s;&s;as to the other. The latter walk light|ly,
have a very fine &s;cent, and often ri&s;e erect
again&s;t the trees, in order to &s;mell at a di&s;tance
the approach of dogs or hunters. When hard
pur&s;ued, they run into the &s;ea, where, by &s;wim|ming
with as much facility as ducks, and even
diving, they often e&s;cape the hunters; for they
&s;wim a long time, and &s;ometimes to great di|&s;tances

<P>THIS animal was never &s;een in Europe,
till the Duke de Bouillon had a young
one tran&s;mitted to him from America. As this
Prince is exceedingly curious with regard to
foreign animals, he has &s;ometimes done me the
honour to inviting me to examine them, and has
even been kind enough to pre&s;ent me with &s;e|veral
<PB N="65" REF="77">
&s;pecies. The animal under con&s;ideration
was killed by the coldne&s;s of the climate before it
had acquired its full growth. It is not a hog,
as is been alledged by naturali&s;ts and travel|lers;
for it has only &s;ome &s;light relations to
the hog, and differs from him in &s;ome remark|able
characters. The cabiai never exceeds the
&s;ize of a hog of eighteen months old. Its head
is &s;horter, and its mouth le&s;s. Its feet are al&s;o
very different from tho&s;e of the hog; for its toes
are connected by membranes. It has larger
eyes and &s;horter ears. In di&s;po&s;itions and man|ners,
it differs not le&s;s from the hog, than in the
&s;tructure of its parts. It lives much in the water,
where it &s;wims like an otter, catches fi&s;hes with
its mouth and feet, and eats them on the banks.
It likewi&s;e eats grain, fruits, and &s;ugar canes.
As its feet are long and broad, it often &s;its on
the hind ones. In&s;tead of the grunting of a hog,
its cry rather re&s;embles the braying of an a&s;s. It
&s;eldom walks but in the night, and then gene|rally
in company, without removing far from
the margin of the water. As it runs badly, on
account of the length of its feet, and the &s;hort|ne&s;s
of its legs, its &s;afety con&s;i&s;ts not in flight.
To e&s;cape the hunters, it plunges into the water,
&s;wims to a great di&s;tance, and remains &s;o long
concealed that they lo&s;e all hopes of getting an|other
view of it. The fle&s;h of it is fat and
tender; but, like that of the other, it has ra|ther
the ta&s;te of bad fi&s;h than of good fle&s;h. It
<PB N="66" REF="78">
has been remarked, however, that its head is
pretty good, which corre&s;ponds with what is
&s;aid of the beaver, that the fle&s;h of its anterior
parts is well ta&s;ted, while that of the po&s;terior
parts has the ta&s;te of fi&s;h. The cabiai is of a
gentle and peaceable di&s;po&s;ition; it neither quar|rels,
nor does mi&s;chief to other animals. It is
ea&s;ily tamed, obeys the voice, and follows &s;pon|taneou&s;ly
tho&s;e with whom it is acquainted, and
who treat it kindly. At Paris, it was fed with bar|ley,
&s;alads, and fruits, and continued in good
condition during the warm &s;ea&s;on. From the great
number of paps, it appears, that the female is
very prolific. We are ignorant of the times of
ge&s;tation and growth, and con&s;equently of the
duration of its life. Our coloni&s;ts at Cayenne
might inform us with regard to the&s;e articles;
for this animal is pretty common in Guiana,
as well as in Bra&s;il, the country of the Ama|zons,
and other low lands of South America.</P>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>SUPPLEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>We have little to add to the hi&s;tory and de|&s;cription
of this American animal. M. de la
Borde writes us, that it is very common in
Guiana, and &s;till more &s;o in the neighbourhood
<PB N="67" REF="79">
of the Amazon river, where the fi&s;hes are ve|ry
numerous. He ramarks, that the&s;e animals
go always in pairs, a male and a female; and
that the large&s;t of them weigh about a hundred
pounds. They fly from the abodes of men,
never leave the banks of rivers, and, when
they perceive any per&s;on, they take to the wa|ter,
without diving like the otters, but &s;wimming
like the hogs. Sometimes, however, they go
to the bottom, and continue there a con&s;iderable
time. They are often taken when young, and
brought up in the hou&s;es, where they ea&s;ily ac|cu&s;tom
them&s;elves to eat bread, millet, and pot-herbs,
though, in a &s;tate of nature, they live
chiefly on fi&s;h. The females bring forth only
one young at a time. They are by no means
dangerous; for they never attack either men or
dogs. Their fle&s;h in white, tender, and well
ta&s;ted. This la&s;t fact &s;eems to contradict what
is &s;aid by other travellers, that the fle&s;h of the
cabiai has rather the ta&s;te of bad fi&s;h, than of
good meat. However, the fle&s;h of the cabiai,
when it lives on fi&s;h, may have this bad ta&s;te,
and, when fed with bread or grain, it may be
very good.</P>
<P>As we had this animal alive in Paris, and
kept it a long time, I am per&s;uaded that it
might be propagated in our climate. I men|tioned
above, p. 65. that it was killed by the
cold. But I have &s;ince been informed, that it
<PB N="68" REF="80">
endured the winter's cold very well; but, as
it was &s;hut up in a garret, it threw it&s;elf down
from the window, and fell into a ve&s;&s;el full of
water, where it was drowned; which would not
have happened, if it had not been hurt in the
fall upon the edge of the ve&s;&s;el.

<P>THE name given to this animal in mo&s;t
European languages leads to the notion
that it is a hog covered with bri&s;tles, though it
has no re&s;emblance to the hog but in the grunt|ing
<PB N="70" REF="83">
noi&s;e it makes. It differs from the hog as
much as any other quadruped, both in figure
and internal &s;tructure. In&s;tead of a long head,
furni&s;hed with long ears, armed with tu&s;ks, and
terminated by a &s;nout; in&s;tead of cloven feet,
covered with hoofs, like the hog; the porcu|pine
has a &s;hort head, like the beaver, two large
cutting teeth in each jaw, no tu&s;ks or canine
teeth, the upper lip divided like that of the hare,
round flat ears, and feet armed with claws. In|&s;tead
of a large &s;tomach with an appendix &s;haped
like a cowl, which, in the hog, &s;eems to form
the &s;hade between the ruminating and other
quadrupeds, the porcupine has only a &s;imple
&s;tomach and a large caecum. The parts of ge|neration
are not apparent, as in the boar; and
the te&s;ticles are hid in the groins. From the&s;e
characters, joined to the &s;hort tail, the long
whi&s;kers, and the divided lip, we may conclude
that the porcupine makes a nearer approach to
the hare, or the beaver, than the hog. The
hedgehog, which, like the porcupine, is armed
with prickles, has a greater re&s;emblance to the
hog; for its muzzle is long, and terminates in
a kind of &s;nout. But, all the&s;e re&s;emblances

Travellers and naturali&s;ts have attributed to
the porcupine the faculty of darting its quills to
a di&s;tance, and with &s;uch force as to inflict deep
wounds: They have likewi&s;e &s;aid, that the quills,
when &s;eparated from the body of the animal,
po&s;&s;e&s;s the extraordinary power of penetrating,
by their own proper exertion, deeper into the
fle&s;h, as &s;oon as their points have entered. This
la&s;t fact is purely imaginary, and the fir&s;t is e|qually
fal&s;e as the &s;econd. The error &s;eems to
have originated from this circum&s;tance, that the
porcupine, when irritated, erects and moves his
quills; and, as &s;ome of them are attached to
the &s;kin only by a delicate pedicle, they ea&s;ily
fall off. We have examined living porcupines,
and, though violently agitated, we never &s;aw
them di&s;charge their quills like darts. It is not
a little &s;urpri&s;ing, therefore, that the grave&s;t
authors, both antient<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Ari&s;t. hi&s;t. anim. lib. 9. cap. 39. Plin. hi&s;t. nat. lib. 8. cap. 53.

The&s;e are likewi&s;e the quills which the porcupines dart a|gain&s;t the hunters, by &s;haking their &s;kin as dogs do when they come out of the water. Claudian, in the &s;ame manner, re|marks, that the porcupine is him&s;elf the bow, the quiver, and the arrow, which he employs again&s;t the hunters; <HI>Mem. pour &s;ervir &agrave; l'hi&s;t. des animaux, tom. 3. p. 114.

P.

He adds, what we be|lieve to be true, that, in the &s;tomach of the porcupine, dif|ferent kinds of bezoar are formed. Some of the&s;e are only a ma&s;s of roots enveloped with a cru&s;t; others, which are &s;mal|ler, &s;eem to be compo&s;ed of pieces of &s;traw and &s;and; and the &s;malle&s;t kind, which exceed not the &s;ize of a nut, appear to be real petrifactions. We have no doubt as to the truth of the&s;e facts; for we found a bezoar of the fir&s;t kind, or an aegagropilus, in the &s;tomach of a porcupine which was &s;ent to us from Italy.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="73" REF="86">
The porcupine, though originally a native of
the warme&s;t climates of Africa and India, can
exi&s;t and multiply in colder countries, &s;uch as
Per&s;ia, Spain, and Italy. Agricola remarks,
that the porcupine was not tran&s;ported into Eu|rope
long before his time. It is found in Spain,
and more commonly in Italy, particularly in
the Appennine mountains in the environs of
Rome. It was from this la&s;t place that M. Mau|duit,
who, &s;timulated by his love of natural hi|&s;tory,
&s;ent us the porcupine which M. Dauben|ton
has de&s;cribed. We have given the figure
of this Italian porcupine, as well as that of In|dia.
The &s;light differences between them de|pend
on the climate, or perhaps they are only
individual varieties.</P>
<P><PB N="74" REF="87">
Ari&s;totle, Pliny, and all the naturali&s;ts, tell us,
that the porcupine, like the bear, conceals it&s;elf
during the winter, and brings forth in thirty
days. The&s;e facts we have not been able to a|&s;certain;
and it is &s;ingular, that, in Italy, where
the animal is common, and where, at all periods,
there have been learned philo&s;ophers and acute
ob&s;ervers, no man has ever written its hi&s;tory.
On this &s;ubject, as well as on many others, Al|drovandus
has only copied Ge&s;ner; and the Gen|tlemen
of the Academy, who have de&s;cribed and
di&s;&s;ected eight porcupines, &s;ay little or nothing
concerning their oeconomy and manners. We
only learn from the te&s;timony of travellers, and
of tho&s;e who keep the porcupine in menageries,
that, in a dome&s;tic &s;tate, it is neither wild nor
ferocious, but only anxious for liberty; and
that, by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of fore teeth, which are
&s;trong and &s;harp, like tho&s;e of the beaver, it cuts
wood, and pierces the door of its cage<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">There are porcupines in Guiney. They grow to the height of two or two and a half feet, and their teeth are &s;o &s;harp and &s;trong that no wood can re&s;i&s;t them. I put one in|to a barrel, imagining that it was &s;ufficiently &s;ecured: But, in one night, it gnawed through the wood, and made its e|&s;cape; <HI>Voyage de Bo&s;man, p.</HI> 253.</NOTE>. We
likewi&s;e know, that it is ea&s;ily fed upon crumbs
of bread, chee&s;e, and fruits; that, in a &s;tate of
liberty, it lives upon roots and wild &s;eeds; that,
when it gets admi&s;&s;ion to a garden, it makes
great havock, and devours all kinds of pot-herbs
with avidity; that, like mo&s;t other animals, it
<PB N="75" REF="88">
becomes fat about the end of &s;ummer; and that
its fle&s;h, though &s;omewhat in&s;ipid, is not bad to
eat.</P>
<P>By examining the form, &s;ub&s;tance, and orga|nization
of the prickles, we ea&s;ily perceive that
they are tubes, and only want vanes to be real
feathers. From this circum&s;tance, the porcupine
con&s;titutes the &s;hade between quadrupeds and
birds. The quills, particularly tho&s;e near the
tail, make a noi&s;e by &s;triking each other when
the animal walks. He can elevate or depre&s;s
his quills, as the peacock rai&s;es or lowers the
feathers of his tail. Hence the mu&s;cular part
of the &s;kin is capable of acting with force, and
its &s;tructure is nearly the &s;ame as that of &s;ome
birds. We have marked the&s;e relations, though
not very apparent. It is always fixing one
point in Nature, who often e&s;capes our re&s;earch|es,
and &s;eems, in her productions, to &s;port with
tho&s;e who wi&s;h to cultivate her acquaintance.</P>

animals has been &s;olely compo&s;ed by men who
are prejudiced with methodical arrangements,
and who mi&s;take their trifling &s;y&s;tems for the
genuine regi&s;ters of Nature. No animals be|longing
to the warm climates of the Old Conti|nent
exi&s;t in America; neither are any of the
South American animals to be found under the
Torrid Zone of Africa and A&s;ia. The porcu|pine,
as formerly remarked, is an original inha|bitant
of the warm countries of the Old World;
and, having never been found in the New, his
name has been transferred to &s;uch animals as re|&s;embled
him, and particularly that now under
con&s;ideration. On the other hand, the coendu
of America has been tran&s;ported to the Ea&s;t In|dies;
and Pi&s;o, who probably knew not the Por|cupine,
made Bontius<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Jac. Bontii, Hi&s;t. Indiae Orient. p. 54.</NOTE>, who treats only of ani|mals
belonging to the &s;outh of A&s;ia, engrave the
American coendou under the name of the true
porcupine; &s;o that, at fir&s;t &s;ight, $word$ would be
tempted to think that this animal exi&s;ted equally
in America and in A&s;ia. With a little attention,
however, it is ea&s;y to perceive, that Pi&s;o, who,
in this article, as well as in mo&s;t parts of his
work, is but the plagiary of Marcgrave, has not
<PB N="78" REF="93">
only copied Marcgrave's figure of the coendou
into his hi&s;tory of Bra&s;il, but likewi&s;e engraved
it again for Bontius's work, which he dige&s;ted
and publi&s;hed. Hence, though we have the fi|gure
of the coendou in Bontius, we mu&s;t not
conclude that it exi&s;ts in Java, or in any other
part of the Ea&s;t Indies, nor take this figure for
that of the Porcupine, between which and the
coendou there is no &s;imilarity, except that both
have quills or &s;pines.</P>
<P>It is to Ximenes, and afterwards to Hernan|dez,
that we owe our fir&s;t knowledge of this ani|mal,
which they have pointed out under the
Mexican name of <HI>Hoitztlacuatzin:</HI> The <HI>tlacu|atzin</HI>
is the opo&s;&s;um; and <HI>hoitztlacuatzin</HI> &s;hould
be tran&s;lated the <HI>bri&s;tly</HI> or <HI>&s;pinous opo&s;&s;um.</HI> This
denomination has been ill applied; for the&s;e ani|mals
have very little re&s;emblance. Marcgrave
has not adopted this Mexican name, but calls
the animal by its Bra&s;ilian name, <HI>cuandu.</HI> Marc|grave,
however, ought to have perceived, that
his Bra&s;ilian cuandu was the &s;ame animal with
the hoitztlacuatzin of Mexico, e&s;pecially as his
figure and de&s;cription corre&s;pond very well with
tho&s;e of Hernandez, and as La&euml;t, the editor and

Pi&s;o, is apparent; for, though he gives the&s;e
coendous in two &s;eparate articles, and &s;eems to
regard them as di&s;tinct &s;pecies, he repre&s;ents
both by the &s;ame figure: Hence we are entitled
to pronounce them to be the &s;ame animal. There
are al&s;o &s;ome naturali&s;ts who not only make
two &s;pecies of the great and &s;mall coendou, but
have &s;eparated them from the hoitztlacuatzin,
and given the whole three as different animals;
I acknowledge, indeed, that, though the coen|dou
and hoitztlacuatzin are probably the &s;ame
animal, their identity is not &s;o certain as that of
the great and &s;mall coendou.</P>
<P><PB N="80" REF="95">
However this matter &s;tands, the coendou is
not the porcupine. The former is much &s;maller.
His head and muzzle are proportionally &s;horter.
He has no plume or cre&s;t on his head, and his
upper-lip is not divided. He has a long tail;
but that of the porcupine is very &s;hort. He is
rather a carnivorous than a frugivorous animal;

<P>By conferring the name of porcupine upon
the coendou, the &s;ame powers have al&s;o been a|&s;cribed
to him, particularly that of &s;hooting his

who ought to have been le&s;s &s;uper&s;titious,
becau&s;e he was a phy&s;ician, &s;hould gravely tell
us, that the quills of the coendou pierce the fle&s;h
by their own proper force, and penetrate into
the bowels of an animal. Though the&s;e facts
be evidently ab&s;urd, Ray is the fir&s;t author who
denied them. But how many ab&s;urdities have

<P>In Guiana there are two &s;pecies of Coendous.
The large&s;t weighs from twelve to fifteen pounds.

bring forth their young, to the number of
two, in the holes of trees. They feed on the
leaves of the&s;e trees, and are not very common.
<PB N="82" REF="97">
Their fle&s;h is extremely good; and the negroes
prefer it to that of the paca. According to M.
de la Borde, the two &s;pecies never mix. They
are never found in pairs, except in the &s;ea&s;on of
love. At other times, they are &s;olitary; and
the females never quit the tree in which they
have brought forth. The&s;e animals are apt to
bite; but their bite is not &s;ore or dangerous.</P>

exi&s;tence, remote from man, from
whom it has obtained no denomination, which
is the fir&s;t badge of his empire. Hud&s;on ha|ving
di&s;covered the land which it inhabits, we
&s;hall give it a name which recalls that of its fir&s;t

ma&s;ter, and indicates, at the &s;ame time, its poig|nant
and bri&s;tly nature. Be&s;ides, it was nece&s;|&s;ary
to be&s;tow a name upon it, to prevent its
being confounded with the porcupine, or the
coendou, which it re&s;embles in &s;ome characters,
but differs &s;o widely from them in all others,
that it ought to be regarded as a particular &s;pe|cies.
It likewi&s;e belongs to a northern climate,

<P>Edwards, Ellis, and Cate&s;by, have all men|tioned
this animal. The figures given by the

&s;hall only &s;ay, that the re&s;emblances appear to
be very great, and the differences but &s;light; and
that, as the&s;e animals are little known, the dif|ferences
may be only individual varieties, or

<P>The Canada porcupine might be called the
<HI>bri&s;tly beaver.</HI> It is a native of the &s;ame coun|try,
is of the &s;ame &s;ize, and has nearly the
&s;ame figure. Like the beaver, it has two long,
&s;harp, and &s;trong cutting teeth in each jaw. In|dependent
of its quills, which are &s;hort, and al|mo&s;t
concealed among the hair, it has, like the
beaver, a double fur, the fir&s;t con&s;i&s;ting of long
&s;oft hairs, and the &s;econd of a down &s;till more
&s;oft. When the animal is young, the quills are
proportionally larger, and more apparent, and
the hairs are &s;horter and thinner than in the a|dults.</P>
<P>This animal avoids all kinds of moi&s;ture. He
retires and depo&s;its his excrements under the
roots of hollow trees<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">See Edwards, hi&s;t. of Birds, p. 52.</NOTE>. He &s;leeps much, and
feeds chiefly on the bark of the juniper bu&s;hes.
In winter, the &s;now &s;erves him for drink; and,
in &s;ummer, he drinks water, which he laps like
a dog. The &s;avages eat his fle&s;h, and clothe
them&s;elves with his fur, after depriving it of the
quills and bri&s;tles.</P>

<PB N="87" REF="104">
independent of in&s;pection or compari&s;on; for
they never roll them&s;elves up into a ball, like
the hedgehog; and be&s;ides, the tanrecs are found

<P>There &s;eems to be two &s;pecies, or perhaps two
races of tanrecs: The fir&s;t, which is nearly as
large as our hedgehog, has a muzzle propor|tionally
longer than the &s;econd; its ears are al|&s;o
more apparent, and it has fewer bri&s;tles
than the other, to which we have given the
name of <HI>Tendrac,</HI> to di&s;tingui&s;h it from the fir&s;t.
This tendrac is not larger than a great rat. Its
muzzle and ears are &s;horter than tho&s;e of the
tanrec, which la&s;t is covered with &s;maller bri&s;tles,
but equally numerous with tho&s;e of the hedge|hog.

&s;pines but on the head, the neck, and the withers,
the re&s;t of the body being covered with coar&s;e

They dig holes in the ground, into which they
retire, and lie in a torpid &s;tate during &s;everal

grows again after they awake. They are gene|rally
very fat; and, though their fle&s;h be in&s;ipid

<HEAD>SECOND VIEW OF NATURE.</HEAD>
<P>INDIVIDUALS, whatever their kind or num|ber
may be, are of no value in the univer&s;e.
Species are the only exi&s;tences in Nature; for they
are equally antient and permanent with her&s;elf.
To form a di&s;tinct idea of this &s;ubject, we &s;hall
not con&s;ider &s;pecies as a collection or &s;ucce&s;&s;ion
of &s;imilar individuals, but as a whole, indepen|dent
of number and of time, always active and
always the &s;ame; a whole, which has been rec|koned
one in the works of creation, and, there|fore,
con&s;titutes only a unit in Nature. Of all
tho&s;e units, the human &s;pecies holds the fir&s;t
rank: The others, from the elephant to the mite,
from the cedar to the hy&s;&s;op, are in the &s;econd
and third orders. Though different in form, in
&s;ub&s;tance, and even in life, each retains its pro|per
place, &s;ub&s;i&s;ts by it&s;elf, defends it&s;elf again&s;t
the others, and the whole together repre&s;ent
animated Nature, who &s;upports, and will con|tinue
to &s;upport her&s;elf in the &s;ame manner as
we now behold her. A day, a year, an age, or
any given portion of time, con&s;titutes no part of
her duration. Time it&s;elf relates only to indi|viduals,
to beings who&s;e exi&s;tence is fugitive.
But the exi&s;tence of &s;pecies is con&s;tant; their
permanence produces duration, and their diffe|rences
<PB N="90" REF="109">
give ri&s;e to number. Let us con&s;ider
&s;pecies in this light; let us give to each an equal
right to the indulgence and &s;upport of Nature.
To her they are all equally dear; for, on each
of them, &s;he has be&s;towed the means of &s;ub&s;i&s;t|ing,
and of la&s;ting as long as her&s;elf.</P>
<P>Let us now &s;uppo&s;e the &s;pecies to change pla|ces
with the individual. We have already &s;een
what Nature is in relation to man; let us next
con&s;ider in what light &s;he would appear to a be|ing
who repre&s;ented the whole human &s;pecies.
In the &s;pring, the verdure of the fields revives,
the buds and flowers expand, the bees recover
from their torpid &s;tate, the &s;wallow returns to
our land, the nightingale chants the &s;ong of love,
the ram fri&s;ks, the bull lows with de&s;ire, and all
animated creatures are eager to join and to
multiply their &s;pecies; we have then no idea
but that of reproduction and the increa&s;e of life.
On the other hand, when the dark &s;ea&s;on of
cold and fro&s;t approaches, animated beings
become indifferent, and even avoid each other;
the inhabitants of the air de&s;ert our climates,
tho&s;e of the water lo&s;e their freedom under
vaults of ice; mo&s;t animals grow torpid, and
dig retreats for them&s;elves in the ground; the
earth hardens, the plants wither, and the trees,
deprived of their foliage, bend under loads of
&s;now and hoar-fro&s;t; every object excites the
idea of languor and annihilation. But the&s;e i|deas
of renovation and de&s;truction, or rather
<PB N="91" REF="110">
the&s;e images of death and life, however great
and general they appear, are only individual and
particular. Man, as an individual, thinks in this
manner: But the being whom we have &s;ub&s;titu|ted
for the &s;pecies, thinks and judges in a man|ner
more &s;ublime and general. In this alternate
de&s;truction and renovation, in all the&s;e &s;ucce&s;|&s;ive
vici&s;&s;itudes, he perceives only permanence
and duration. The &s;ea&s;on of one year is to
him the &s;ame as that of the preceding, the &s;ame
as that of millions of ages. The thou&s;andth a|nimal,
in the order of generation, is the &s;ame to
him as the fir&s;t. In fine, if man lived for ever,
if all the beings which &s;urround him exi&s;ted in
the &s;ame manner as they do at pre&s;ent, the idea
of time would vani&s;h, and the individual would
become the &s;pecies.</P>
<P>Why &s;hould we not con&s;ider Nature, for a
few moments, under this new a&s;pect? In truth,
man comes into this world enveloped in dark|ne&s;s.
The mind being equally naked with the
body, he is born without knowledge and with|out
defence. He brings nothing with him
but pa&s;&s;ive qualities. He is obliged to receive
the impre&s;&s;ions of objects on his organs; the
light &s;hines long on his eyes before he can re|cogni&s;e
it. At fir&s;t, he receives every thing from
Nature, and makes her no returns. But, as &s;oon
as his &s;en&s;es have acquired &s;trength an activity,
as &s;oon as he can compare his &s;en&s;ations, he re|flects
upon the univer&s;e; he forms ideas, and
<PB N="92" REF="111">
retains, extends, and combines them. Man, e|&s;pecially
when he has been in&s;tructed, is not a
&s;imple individual: He repre&s;ents, in a great mea|&s;ure,
the whole human &s;pecies. He begins with
receiving from his parents the knowledge which
had been tran&s;mitted to them from their fathers;
thus, by means of the divine arts of writing and
printing, the pre&s;ent age is, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, i|dentified
with tho&s;e that are pa&s;t. This accu|mulation,
in one man, of the experience of ma|ny
centuries, extends the limits of his being to
infinity. He is no more a &s;imple individual,
born, like other animals, with the capacity of
attending to pre&s;ent &s;en&s;ations alone: He is
nearly the being we &s;uppo&s;ed to repre&s;ent the
whole &s;pecies. He reads what is pa&s;t, &s;ees the
pre&s;ent, and judges of the future; and, in the
torrent of time, which carries off and ab&s;orbs all
the individuals of the univer&s;e, he perceives that
the &s;pecies are permanent, and Nature invariable.
The relations of objects being always the &s;ame,
to him the order of time appears to be nothing.
In his eyes, the laws of renovation only coun|terbalance
tho&s;e of permanence: A continual
&s;ucce&s;&s;ion of &s;imilar beings is, in effect, equiva|lent
only to the perpetual exi&s;tence of one of
the&s;e beings.</P>
<P>What purpo&s;es, then, are &s;erved by this va&s;t
train of generations, this immen&s;e profu&s;ion of
germs, many thou&s;ands of which are abortive
for one that &s;ucceeds? Does not this perpetual
<PB N="93" REF="112">
propagation of beings, which are ince&s;&s;antly de|&s;troyed
and renewed, uniformly exhibit the &s;ame
&s;cene, and occupy neither more nor le&s;s of Na|ture?
From whence proceed tho&s;e alterations of
life and death, tho&s;e laws of growth and decay,
all tho&s;e individual vici&s;&s;itudes, and all tho&s;e re|iterated
repre&s;entations of one and the &s;ame
thing? They are derived from the very e&s;&s;ence
of Nature, and depend on the fir&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hment
of the univer&s;al machine; the whole of which
is fixed and &s;table; but each of its parts being
capable of motion, the general movements of
the cele&s;tial bodies have produced the particular
motions of this terre&s;trial globe. The penetra|ting
forces by which the&s;e immen&s;e bodies are a|nimated,
by which they act reciprocally upon
each other at a di&s;tance, animate at the &s;ame
time every particle of matter; and this mutual
propen&s;ity of all the parts toward each other, is
the fir&s;t bond of beings, the principle of con&s;i|&s;tence
and permanency in Nature, and the &s;up|port
of harmony in the univer&s;e. The great
combinations give ri&s;e to the &s;maller relations:
The motion of the earth on its own axis having
divided the portions of duration into day and
night, all its animated inhabitants have their
times of light and of darkne&s;s, of waking and
&s;leeping. The action of the &s;en&s;es, and the mo|tions
of the members, which con&s;titute a great
part of the animal oeconomy, are related to this
fir&s;t combination. Would there be &s;en&s;es alive
<PB N="94" REF="113">
to light in a world there perpetual darkne&s;s
reigned?</P>
<P>The inclination of the axis of the earth pro|ducing,
in its annual motion round the &s;un, con|&s;iderable
changes of heat and cold, which we
call <HI>&s;ea&s;ons,</HI> all vegetables have al&s;o, either totally or
partially, their &s;ea&s;ons of life and of death. The
fall of the leaves and fruits, the withering of
herbs, and the de&s;truction of in&s;ects, depend en|tirely
on this &s;econd combination. In climates
where it does not take place, the life of vegetables
is never &s;u&s;pended, and every in&s;ect completes
its peculiar period of exi&s;tence. Under the line,
where the four &s;ea&s;ons make but one, the earth
is always covered with flowers, the trees are in
perpetual verdure, and Nature enjoys a conti|nual
&s;pring.</P>
<P>The particular con&s;titution of animals and of
plants is relative to the general temperature of
the earth, and this temperature depends on the
&s;ituation or di&s;tance of the earth from the &s;un.
If removed to a greater di&s;tance, our animals and
plants could neither live nor vegetate. The wa|ter,
the &s;ap, the blood, all the liquors, would
lo&s;e their fluidity: At a &s;maller di&s;tance, they
would vani&s;h and di&s;&s;ipate in vapour. Ice and
fire are the elements of death; temperate heat
is the fir&s;t germ of life.</P>
<P>The living particles diffu&s;ed through organized
bodies are related, both by their activity and
number, to the particles of light, which &s;trike
<PB N="95" REF="114">
and penetrate all matter with their heat. Where|ever
the rays of the &s;un can heat the earth, its
&s;urface is covered with verdure, and peopled
with animals. Even ice it&s;elf, as &s;oon as it di&s;|&s;olves
into water, &s;eems to be fecundated. This
element is more fertile than that of the earth:
From heat it receives motion and life. The &s;ea
produces, every &s;ea&s;on, more animals than the
earth &s;u&s;tains: But it produces fewer vegetables.
Hence all the animals which inhabit the ocean,
by not having, like tho&s;e on the land, a perma|nent
&s;tock of vegetable &s;ub&s;tances to &s;upport
them, are under the nece&s;&s;ity of feeding up|on
each other; and to this combination their
immen&s;e multiplication is to be referred.</P>
<P>Every &s;pecies having been originally created,
the fir&s;t individuals &s;erved as a model to their
de&s;cendants. The body of each animal or ve|getable
is a mould, to which are a&s;&s;imilated in|differently
the organic particles of all animals or
vegetables which have been de&s;troyed by death
or con&s;umed by time. The brute particles,
which formed part of their compo&s;ition, return
to the common ma&s;s of inanimated matter. But
the organic particles, who&s;e duration is perma|nent,
are re&s;umed by organized bodies: They
are fir&s;t extracted from the earth by vegetables,
then ab&s;orbed by animals which feed upon ve|getables,
and thus &s;erve for the expan&s;ion, &s;up|port,
and growth of both. By circulating per|petually
from body to body, they animate all
<PB N="96" REF="115">
organized beings. The &s;tock of the&s;e living &s;ub|&s;tances
is always the &s;ame. They vary only in
form, or in difference of appearance. In fertile
ages, during the times of the greate&s;t popula|tion,
the whole &s;urface of the earth &s;eems to be
covered with men, dome&s;tic animals, and u&s;eful
plants. But, during the period of famine and
depopulation, the ferocious animals, noxious in|&s;ects,
para&s;itical plants, and u&s;ele&s;s herbs, re&s;ume,
in their turn, dominion over the earth. The&s;e
changes, &s;o &s;en&s;ible to man, are perfectly indif|ferent
to Nature: The &s;ilk-worm, &s;o precious to us,
is to her only the caterpillar of the mulberry tree.
Though this caterpillar, which mini&s;ters to our
luxury, &s;hould di&s;appear, though the plants
which nouri&s;h our dome&s;tic animals &s;hould be
devoured by other caterpillars, though others
&s;hould threaten with de&s;truction the &s;ub&s;tance
of our corns before the harve&s;t, in fine, though
man and the larger animals &s;hould be &s;tarved by
the inferior tribes, Nature would not be le&s;s full,
nor le&s;s alive. She protects not one at the ex|pence
of another; &s;he equally &s;upports the whole.
But, with regard to individuals, &s;he knows not
number, and views them only as &s;ucce&s;&s;ive ima|ges
of the &s;ame impre&s;&s;ion, as fugitive &s;hadows,
of which the &s;pecies is the &s;ub&s;tance.</P>
<P>There exi&s;ts, therefore, in the earth, air, and
waters, a determined quantity of organic matter
which nothing can de&s;troy, and, at the &s;ame
time, a determined number of moulds capable
<PB N="97" REF="116">
of a&s;&s;imilating it; and the&s;e moulds are perpe|tually
annihilated and renewed. This number
of moulds, or individuals, though variable in
every &s;pecies, is, upon the whole, always the
&s;ame, always proportioned to the quantity of
living matter. If this matter were redundant,
if it were not at all times equally occupied, and
entirely ab&s;orbed by the moulds which already
exi&s;t, it would form others, and produce new
&s;pecies. Being alive, it never remains without
action; and its union with brute matter is &s;uffi|cient
to con&s;titute organized bodies. It is to
this great combination, or rather to this inva|riable
proportion, that Nature owes her form
and con&s;i&s;tence.</P>
<P>As the laws of Nature regarding the number,
&s;upport, and equilibrium, of the &s;pecies, are
fixed and permanent, &s;he would uniformly ex|hibit
the &s;ame appearances, and, in all climates
and times, would be ab&s;olutely and relatively
the &s;ame, if her complexion did not vary almo&s;t
infinitely in individual forms. The impre&s;&s;ion
of each &s;pecies is a figure, the principal features
of which are engraven in characters which can
never be effaced. But all the acce&s;&s;ory &s;hades
and touches are greatly diver&s;ified; no indivi|dual
has a perfect re&s;emblance to another; no
&s;pecies exi&s;ts without a number of varieties. In
the human &s;pecies, which bears the &s;tronge&s;t
marks of divinity, the impre&s;&s;ion varies from
white to black, from &s;mall to great, &amp;c. The
<PB N="98" REF="117">
Laplander, the Patagonian, the Hottentot, the
European, the American, and the Negro, though
&s;prung from the &s;ame parents, have by no means
the &s;imilarity of brothers.</P>
<P>All &s;pecies, therefore, are &s;ubject to individual
differences: But the con&s;tant varieties, which are
perpetuated through &s;ucce&s;&s;ive generations, belong
not equally to every &s;pecies. The more digni|fied
the &s;pecies, its figure is the more fixed, and
admits of fewer varieties. The multiplication
of animals being inver&s;ely proportional to their
magnitude, and the po&s;&s;ibility of differences be|ing
in the direct proportion to the numbers
they produce, there mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be more
varieties among the &s;mall than the large ani|mals,
and, for the &s;ame rea&s;on, a greater num|ber
of &s;pecies which make a near approach to
each other. In large animals, the unity of the
&s;pecies is more fixed, and the di&s;tance which &s;e|parates
them is al&s;o more extended. How many
varieties and neighbouring &s;pecies accompany,
follow, or precede the &s;quirrel, the rat, and o|ther
&s;mall quadrupeds, while the maje&s;tic, ele|phant
walks alone, and without a peer, at the
head of the whole?</P>
<P>The brute matter, of which the ma&s;s of the
earth is compo&s;ed, is a virgin or untouched &s;ub|&s;tance,
that has undergone no alterations. But
the whole has been more than once put in mo|tion,
and di&s;trubed by the hand of Nature. The
globe of the earth has been penetrated by fire,
<PB N="99" REF="118">
and afterwards covered and di&s;ordered by water.
The &s;and which fills the interior parts of the
earth is a vitrified matters. The thick beds of
clay which cover its &s;urface, are only the &s;ame
&s;and decompo&s;ed by the operation of the waters.
Granite, free &s;tone, flint, and all the metals, are
nothing but this &s;ame vitrified matter, the par|ticles
of which are united, conden&s;ed, or &s;epa|rated,
according to the laws of their affinity.
All the&s;e &s;ub&s;tances are perfectly inanimate:
They exi&s;t, and will continue to exi&s;t, indepen|dent
of animals and vegetables. But there are
many other &s;ub&s;tances, which, though they
appear to be equally inanimate, derive their
origin from organized bodies: Marble, lime|&s;tone,
chalk, and marle, are compo&s;ed of the
&s;poils of &s;hells, and of tho&s;e &s;mall animals
which, by transforming the water of the &s;ea in|to
&s;tone, produce coral, and all the madrepores,
the varieties of which are numberle&s;s, and the
quantity almo&s;t immen&s;e. Pit coal, turf, and
other &s;ub&s;tances, al&s;o found in the &s;uperiour &s;tra|ta
of the earth, are nothing but the re&s;idue of
vegetables more or le&s;s corrupted and con&s;umed.
In fine, there are other &s;ub&s;tances, though fewer
in number, &s;uch as pumice &s;tones, &s;ulphur, the
&s;coriae of iron, a&s;be&s;tos, and lava, which have been
thrown out by volcanoes, and produced by a &s;econd
action of fire upon the original matters. To the&s;e
three great combinations may be referred all the
<PB N="100" REF="119">
relations of brute matter, and all the &s;ub&s;tances
of the mineral kingdom.</P>
<P>The laws of affinity, by which the con&s;tituent
particles of the&s;e different &s;ub&s;tances &s;eparate
from each other, in order to unite among them|&s;elves,
and form homogeneous ma&s;&s;es, are the
&s;ame with that general law by which the cele&s;|tial
bodies act upon one another. Their exer|tions
are mutual, and proportioned to their ma&s;|&s;es
and di&s;tances. Globules of water, of &s;and,
or of metal, act upon each other in the &s;ame
manner as the earth acts upon the moon: And,
if the&s;e laws of affinity have hitherto been re|garded
as different from tho&s;e of gravity, it mu&s;t
be a&s;cribed to the confined views we have taken
of the &s;ubject. Figure, which, in the cele&s;tial
bodies, has almo&s;t no effect upon their mutual
action, becau&s;e the di&s;tance is too great, has great
influence when the di&s;tance is very &s;mall. If
the earth and moon, in&s;tead of a &s;pherical figure,
were both &s;hort cylinders, and equal throughout
in their diameters, their reciprocal action would
not be &s;en&s;ibly altered by this difference of fi|gure,
becau&s;e the di&s;tance of all the parts of the
moon from tho&s;e of the earth would be very
little changed. But, if the&s;e &s;ame globes were
cylinders of great extent, and placed near each
other, the law of their reciprocal action would
appear to be very different; becau&s;e the relative
di&s;tances of their parts would be greatly varied.
Hence, whenever figure becomes a principle in
<PB N="101" REF="120">
di&s;tance, the law &s;eems to vary, though, in fact,
it remains always the &s;ame.</P>
<P>From this principle, the human intellect may
advance one &s;tep farther, and penetrate deeper
into the operations of Nature. We are ignorant
of the figure of the con&s;tituent particles of bo|dies.
Water, air, earth, metals, and all homo|geneous
&s;ub&s;tances, are unque&s;tionably compo&s;ed
of elementary particles, which are &s;imilar among
them&s;elves, but who&s;e figure is unknown. Po|&s;terity,
by the aid of calculation, may di&s;clo&s;e
this new field of knowledge, and a&s;certain, with
con&s;iderable preci&s;ion, the figure of the elements
of bodies. They will take the principle we have
e&s;tabli&s;hed as the ba&s;is of their rea&s;oning: <HI>All
matter is attracted in the inver&s;e ratio of the
&s;quare of the di&s;tance; and this law &s;eems to ad|mit
of no variation in particular attractions, but
what ari&s;es from the figure of the con&s;tituent par|ticles
of each &s;ub&s;tance; becau&s;e this figure enters,
as an element or principle into the di&s;tance.</HI> Hence,
when they di&s;cover, be reiterated experiments,
the law of attraction in any particular &s;ub&s;tance,
they may find, by calculation, the figure of its
con&s;tituent particles. To make this matter
more clear, let us &s;uppo&s;e, that, by placing mer|cury
on a perfectly poli&s;hed &s;urface, we find,
by experiment, that this fluid metal is always
attracted in the inver&s;e ratio of the cube of the
di&s;tance, we mu&s;t inve&s;tigate, by the rules of
fal&s;e po&s;ition, what figure gives this expre&s;&s;ion;
<PB N="102" REF="121">
and this figure will be that of the con&s;tituent
particles of mercury. If, from the&s;e experi|ments,
it appeared that the attraction of mercu|ry
was in the inver&s;e ratio of the &s;quare of the
di&s;tance, it would be demon&s;trated that its con|&s;tituent
particles are &s;pherical; becau&s;e a &s;phere
is the only figure which ob&s;erves this law, and,
at whatever di&s;tance globes are placed, the law
of their attraction is always the &s;ame.</P>
<P>Newton conjectured, that chemical affinities,
which are nothing but the particular attractions
we have mentioned, were produced by laws &s;i|milar
to tho&s;e of gravitation. But he &s;eems not
to have perceived, that all the&s;e particular laws
were only &s;imple modifications of the general
law, and that they appeared to be different, on|ly
becau&s;e, at very &s;mall di&s;tances, the figure of
atoms which attract each other has a greater
influence upon the expre&s;&s;ion of this law, than
the ma&s;s of matter.</P>
<P>Upon this theory, however, the intimate
knowledge of the compo&s;ition of brute matter
&s;olely depends. The ba&s;is of all matter is the
&s;ame; and the form of it would likewi&s;e be the
&s;ame, if the figure of its con&s;tituent particles
were perfectly &s;imilar. One homogeneous &s;ub|&s;tance
cannot differ from another, but in pro|portion
to the difference of the figures of their
primitive particles. A body, of which all the
particles are &s;pherical, ought to be one half &s;pe|cifically
lighter than another who&s;e particles
<PB N="103" REF="122">
are cubical; becau&s;e the fir&s;t, by touching each
other only in points, leave intervals equal to the
&s;paces they occupy, while the cubical particles
unite without leaving the &s;malle&s;t void, and,
con&s;equently, form a matter one half heavier
than the fir&s;t. Though figures may be infinitely
varied, they &s;eem not to be &s;o numerous in Na|ture
as might be imagined; for &s;he has fixed
the limits of gravity and levity. Gold and air
are the two extremes of den&s;ity. All the figures
admitted by Nature, therefore, are comprehend|ed
between the&s;e two terms; and all tho&s;e
which would have produced heavier or lighter
&s;ub&s;tances have been rejected.</P>
<P>When I &s;peak of figures employed by Nature,
I mean not that they are nece&s;&s;arily, or even
exactly, &s;imilar to tho&s;e geometrical figures
which exi&s;t in our imagination. We make laws
by &s;uppo&s;ition, and we render them &s;imple by
ab&s;traction. There are, perhaps, neither exact
cubes, nor perfect &s;pheres in the univer&s;e. But,
as nothing exi&s;ts without form, and as, accor|ding
to the diver&s;ity of &s;ub&s;tances, the figures of
the elements are different, &s;ome of them mu&s;t
nece&s;&s;arily approach to the &s;phere, the cube, and
all the other regular figures which we have con|ceived.
The preci&s;e, the ab&s;olute, the ab&s;tract,
which &s;o often pre&s;ent them&s;elves to our minds,
can have no real exi&s;tence, becau&s;e all objects
are related, differ only by almo&s;t imperceptible
&s;hades, and are allied by approximation. In
<PB N="104" REF="123">
the &s;ame manner, when I mention one &s;ub&s;tance
as being entirely full, becau&s;e it is compo&s;ed of
cubical particles, and another as being only half
full, becau&s;e its con&s;tituent particles are &s;pherical,
I &s;peak only comparatively, and mean not that
&s;uch &s;ub&s;tances really exi&s;t; for we know from
experience, that, in tran&s;parent bodies, &s;uch as
gla&s;s, which is both den&s;e and heavy, the quan|tity
of matter is very &s;mall in proportion to the
extent of the intervals; and it might be de|mon&s;trated,
that gold, which is the den&s;e&s;t &s;pe|cies
of matter, contains more vacuities than
&s;ub&s;tance.</P>
<P>The con&s;ideration of the powers of Nature is the
object of rational mechanics; that of &s;en&s;ible mecha|nics
is only a combination of particular powers,
and is reduced to the art of con&s;tructing machines.
Nece&s;&s;ity and convenience have at all times in|&s;ured
the culture of this art. The antients excel|led
in it as well as the moderns. But rational
mechanics is a &s;cience invented in our days. All
philo&s;ophers, from Ari&s;totle to De&s;cartes, have
rea&s;oned like the vulgar upon the nature of mo|tion.
They have uniformly mi&s;taken the ef|fect
for the cau&s;e. They knew no force but
that of impul&s;ion, to which they attributed the
effects of other forces, and referred to it all the
phaenomena of the univer&s;e. If the notion
had been plau&s;ible, or even po&s;&s;ible, this impul|&s;ion,
which they regarded as the &s;ole cau&s;e, mu&s;t
at lea&s;t have been a general effect, which equal|ly
<PB N="105" REF="124">
belonged to all matter, and which continual|ly
exerted it&s;elf in all places, and at all times.
The oppo&s;ite was daily demon&s;trated to them.
Did they not perceive, that, in bodies at re&s;t,
this force had no exi&s;tence; that, in projected
bodies, it &s;ub&s;i&s;ted but a &s;ort time, and was
&s;oon de&s;troyed by re&s;i&s;tence; that, to renew it,
a fre&s;h impul&s;e was nece&s;&s;ary; and that, con&s;e|quently,
&s;o far from being a general cau&s;e, it
was only a particular effect, produced by more
general effects?</P>
<P>Now, a general effect is what ought to be
called a cau&s;e; for the real cau&s;e of this effect
can never be known to us; becau&s;e all our
knowledge is derived from compari&s;on; and an
effect being &s;uppo&s;ed general, and belonging e|qually
to all matter, we can compare it to no|thing,
and, of cour&s;e, can know it only by the
fact. Hence attraction, or gravity, being a ge|neral
effect common to all matter, and demon|&s;trated
by the fact, it ought to be regarded as a
cau&s;e, and to it &s;hould be referred all other
particular cau&s;es, and even that of impul&s;ion,
&s;ince it is le&s;s general and le&s;s con&s;tant. The
difficulty is to perceive how impul&s;ion can be
an effect of attraction. If we reflect on the
communication of motion by impul&s;e, we will
be per&s;uaded that it can only be tran&s;mitted from
one body to another by ela&s;ticity, and that all
the hypothe&s;es concerning the communication
of motion in hard bodies, are mere fancies,
<PB N="106" REF="125">
which have no exi&s;tence in Nature. A body
perfectly hard or perfectly ela&s;tic, is a creature
of imagination. Neither the one nor the other
really exi&s;t; becau&s;e nothing exi&s;ts ab&s;olutely
or in extreme, and the idea of perfection is
only the ab&s;olute or extreme of a thing.</P>
<P>If there was no ela&s;ticity in matter, there
could be no impul&s;ive force. When we throw
a &s;tone, the motion which it acquires is commu|nicated
to it by the ela&s;ticity of the arm. When
a body in motion meets another at re&s;t, how can
we conceive that the one &s;hould communicate
motion to the other in any other manner than by
compre&s;&s;ing the &s;pring of the ela&s;tic particles it
contains, which, by recovering it&s;elf immedi|ately
after compre&s;&s;ion, gives to the whole ma&s;s
the &s;ame force that it received. We cannot com|prehend
how a perfectly hard body &s;hould admit
this force, or receive motion. Be&s;ides, the in|quiry
is u&s;ele&s;s, as no &s;uch body exi&s;ts. All bo|dies,
on the contrary, are endowed with ela&s;ti|city.
Experiments on electricity prove that
its force is ela&s;tic, and belongs to matter in ge|neral.
Though, therefore, no other ela&s;ticity
exi&s;ted in the interior parts of bodies but that
of this electrical matter, it would be &s;ufficient
for the communication of motion; and, con&s;e|quently,
to this great &s;pring, as a general effect,
the particular cau&s;e of impul&s;ion mu&s;t be a|&s;cribed.</P>
<P><PB N="107" REF="126">
Now, if we reflect upon the mechani&s;m of
ela&s;ticity, we &s;hall find, that its force depends
on that of attraction. To obtain a clearer per|ception
of this &s;ubject, let us &s;uppo&s;e the mo&s;t
&s;imple &s;pring, a &s;olid angle of iron; or of any o|ther
hard &s;ub&s;tance: What will be the re&s;ult of
compre&s;&s;ing it? We oblige the parts adjacent to
the top of the angle to bend, or to &s;eparate a
little from each other; and, the moment the pre&s;|&s;ure
is removed, they approach each other as
formerly. Their adhe&s;ion, from which the co|he&s;ion
of bodies re&s;ults, is well known to be an
effect of their mutual attraction. When the &s;pring
is pre&s;&s;ed, this adhe&s;ion is not de&s;troyed; be|cau&s;e,
though the particles are &s;eparated, they are
not &s;o far removed from each other as to put them
beyond their &s;phere of mutual attraction. Of
cour&s;e, as &s;oon as the pre&s;&s;ure cea&s;es, this force
is again exerted, the &s;eparated parts approach,
and their &s;pring is re&s;tored. If, on the other
hand, by a pre&s;&s;ure too violent, they are removed
beyond the &s;phere of their attraction, the &s;pring
breaks; becau&s;e the compre&s;&s;ing force has been
greater than that of cohe&s;ion, or than that of the
mutual attraction, which keeps the particles to|gether.
Hence ela&s;ticity can exert it&s;elf only in
proportion to the cohe&s;ion of the particles of
matter, that is, in proportion as they are united
by the force of their mutual attraction; and,
con&s;equently, ela&s;ticity in general, which alone
can produce impul&s;ion, and the impul&s;ion it&s;elf,
<PB N="108" REF="127">
are owing to the force of attraction, and de|pend
on it as particular effects on a general
effect.</P>
<P>However clear the&s;e ideas appear to me, I ex|pect
not to &s;ee them adopted. The people ne|ver
rea&s;on but from their &s;en&s;ations; and natural
philo&s;ophers judge from their prejudices. All
the&s;e mu&s;t, therefore, be &s;et a&s;ide, and very
few will remain to form a proper judgment.
But this is the fate of Truth; &s;he is content
with a few admirers, and is always lo&s;t in a
crowd: Though at all times augu&s;t and ma|je&s;tic,
&s;he is often ob&s;cured by fanta&s;tic notions,
or totally effaced by brilliant chimeras. This,
however, is the manner in which I view and
under&s;tand Nature; and perhaps &s;he is &s;till more
&s;imple: A &s;ingle force is the cau&s;e of the phae|nomena
exhibited by brute matter; and this
force, when combined with that of heat, pro|duces
tho&s;e living particles on which all the ef|fects
of organized bodies depend.</P>

and has always been confined to the de&s;erts
of Aethiopia, and to &s;ome provinces in the &s;outh
of Africa and India. As the&s;e countries were
unknown to the Greeks, Ari&s;totle has made no
mention of this animal. Pliny &s;peaks of it, and
Oppian de&s;cribes it in a manner which is by no
means ambiguous<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Oppian. de Venat. lib. 3.</NOTE>. The Camelopardalis, this
<PB N="111" REF="130">
la&s;t author remarks, has &s;ome re&s;emblance to
the camel. Its &s;kin is &s;potted like that of the
panther, and its neck is as long as that of the
camel. Its head and ears are &s;mall, its feet large,
and its legs long, but unequal, tho&s;e before be|ing
much taller than tho&s;e behind, which are
very &s;hort, and &s;eem to bring the rump of the

eyes brilliant, the tail &s;hort, and garni&s;hed with
black hairs at the point. By adding to this de|&s;cription

camelopard. The Aethopian amba&s;&s;adors, &s;ays
Heliodorus, brought an animal of the &s;ize of a
camel, who&s;e &s;kin was marked with lively &s;pots
and brilliant colours, and who&s;e po&s;terior parts
were much lower than the anterior. The neck,
though attached to a pretty large body, was thin.
The head, in figure, re&s;embled that of the ca|mel,
and, in &s;ize, it was not twice as large as
that of the o&s;tritch. The eyes appear to be
tinged with different colours. The gait of this
animal was different from that of all other qua|drupeds,
who in walking lift their feet diago|nally,
that is, the right fore foot with the left
hind foot. But the camelopard ambles natural|ly,
lifting the two right or the two left feet to|gether.

lower than the anterior; &s;o that, at the rump, it
is not higher than an ox, and at the &s;houlders
it is higher than a camel. From this di&s;|proportion

de&s;cription of the camelopard. &startq;I &s;aw,&endq; &s;ays he,
&startq;at the ca&s;tle of Cairo, an animal commonly
called <HI>Zurnapa.</HI> It was formerly denominated
<HI>Camelopardalis,</HI> a name compounded of <HI>leopard</HI>
and <HI>camel;</HI> for it is variegated with the &s;pots of
a leopard, and has a long neck, like the camel.
It is a mo&s;t beautiful creature, as gentle in its
di&s;po&s;itions as a &s;heep, and more amiable than
any other wild bea&s;t. Its head is nearly &s;imi|lar
to that of the &s;tag, except in &s;ize. Its horns
are blunt, &s;ix inches long, and covered with
hair; tho&s;e of the male are longer than tho&s;e
of the female. Both male and female have
large ears, like tho&s;e of a cow, and a black
<PB N="113" REF="132">
tongue re&s;embling that of an ox. It has no
teeth in the upper jaw. The neck is long,
&s;traight, and &s;lender. The horns are round
and delicate, the legs long and &s;lender, and
tho&s;e behind are &s;o low, that the animal &s;eems
to &s;tand on end. Its feet re&s;emble tho&s;e of an
ox. Its tail, which hangs as low as the hock,
is round, having hairs three times as gro&s;s as
tho&s;e of a hor&s;e. The hair on the body is
white and red. Its manner of running is &s;i|milar
to that of the camel. When it runs, the
two fore feet move together. It lies on its
belly, and has hard protuberances on its brea&s;t
and thighs, like the camel. When &s;tanding, it
cannot brow&s;e the gra&s;s, without &s;preading its
fore feet very wide, and even then the opera|tion
is performed with great difficulty; for
which rea&s;on it could not live in the fields, if
it were not &s;upplied with the leaves and &s;prigs
of trees<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Ob&s;erv. de Belon, p. 118.</NOTE>.&endq;</P>

three giraffes at Cairo. They had two horns
of &s;ix inches in length, and, on the middle of
the front, a protuberance about two inches
high, which re&s;embled a third horn. This a|nimal,
when he rai&s;es his head, is &s;ixteen feet
high; the neck alone is &s;even feet; and the
length, from the extremity of the tail to the end
of the no&s;e, is twenty-two feet. The fore and
<PB N="114" REF="133">
hind legs are nearly of an equal height. But
the fore thighs are &s;o di&s;proportionally long,
that the back of the animal inclines like the
roof of a hou&s;e. The whole body is marked
with large yellow &s;pots, nearly of a &s;quare fi|gure
..... It has cloven feet like the ox. The
upper lip protrudes beyond the under. The
tail is &s;lender, with hairs at the point. It ru|minates
and eats herbage, like the ox. Its mane
extends from the top of the head along the
back. When it walks, its legs and flanks on
both &s;ides &s;eem to be alternately lame; and,
when it brow&s;es herbage or drinks, it is obli|ged
to &s;pread its fore legs prodigiou&s;ly wide.&endq;</P>
<P>Ge&s;ner quotes Belon for affirming that the
horns of the giraffe fall off like tho&s;e of the fal|low
deer<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Giraffis et damis cornua cadunt; <HI>Belon, Ge&s;ner. hi&s;t. quad. p.</HI> 148.</NOTE>. I could never di&s;cover this fact in
Belon. He only &s;ays, in the above pa&s;&s;age, that
the horns of the giraffe are covered with hair.
He makes no other mention of this animal, ex|cept
when treating of the axis, where he remarks,
&startq;that the ground colour of the giraffe is white,
and that the large &s;pots &s;cattered over the body
are reddi&s;h, but not &s;o red as tho&s;e of the ax|is
<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ob&s;erv. de Belon, p. 120.</NOTE>.&endq; This fact, however, which I can no
where di&s;cover, would be of great importance in
determining the nature of the giraffe; for, if its
horns &s;hed annually, it belongs to the deer kind;
and, on the other hand, if its horns are perma|nent,
<PB N="115" REF="134">
it mu&s;t be referred to the ox or goat kind.
Until we obtain a di&s;tinct knowledge of this fact,
we cannot affirm, as our nomenclators have done,
that the giraffe belongs to the genus of &s;tags;
and it is a&s;toni&s;hing that Ha&s;&s;elqui&s;t, who has
lately given a very long, and very inanimated

<P>In the year 1764, a drawing of the giraffe,
accompanied with &s;ome remarks, was &s;ent to the
academy of &s;ciences, from which we learn, that
this animal, which was thought to be peculiar
to Aethiopia<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">The giraffe is no where found but in Aethiopia. I &s;aw two tame ones in the royal palace. I remarked, that, when they wanted to drink, they were obliged to &s;pread the fore|legs very wide, otherwi&s;e, though their necks were long, they could not reach the water. What I relate, I &s;aw with my eyes; <HI>Relation de Thevenot, p.</HI> 10.</NOTE>, is likewi&s;e found in the neigh|bourhood
of the Cape of Good Hope. The fi|gure
is &s;o incorrect, that no u&s;e can be made of
it; but, as the remarks contain a kind of de|&s;cription,
they merit in&s;ertion: &startq;In an expedi|tion,
made in the year 1702, two hundred
leagues to the north of the Cape of Good Hope,
we found the camelopardalis, who&s;e figure we
have &s;ubjoined. The body re&s;embles that of
an ox, and the head and neck tho&s;e of a hor&s;e.
All tho&s;e we met with were white with brown
&s;pots. It has two horns, and cloven feet. The
two we killed, and who&s;e &s;kins have been
tran&s;mitted to Europe, were of the following
dimen&s;ions: The length of the head, one foot
eight inches; the height, from the extremity
of the fore foot to the withers, ten feet, and
from the withers to the top of the head, &s;even
feet, in all &s;eventeen feet high. The length,
<PB N="118" REF="137">
from the withers to the reins is five feet &s;ix in|ches,
and from the reins to the tail, one foot
&s;ix inches: Thus, the whole length of the body
is &s;even feet. The height, from the hind
feet to the reins, is eight feet &s;ix inches. From
the di&s;proportion in the height and length, it
appears that this animal can be of little u&s;e.
He feeds upon the leaves of trees; and, when
he wants to drink, or to take any thing from
the &s;urface of the earth, he is obliged to bend
down on his knees.&endq;</P>
<P>In examining what travellers have &s;aid con|cerning
the giraffe, I find they all agree, that this
animal, when in its natural &s;ituation, can reach
with its head from &s;ixteen to &s;eventeen feet
high<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Pro&s;per Alpinus is the only author who gives a different idea of the magnitude of this animal, by comparing it to a &s;mall hor&s;e: &startq;Anno 1581, Alexandriae vidimus cameloparda|lem, quem Arabes zurnap et no&s;tri giraffam appellant; haec equum parvum eleganti&s;&s;imumque repre&s;entare videtur;&endq; <HI>p.</HI> 236.

<P><PB N="120" REF="139">
From what we have related, it is evident, that
the giraffe is a peculiar &s;pecies, and very differ|ent
from all others. He &s;eems, however, to
make a nearer approach to the camel than to
the &s;tag or the ox. It is true the giraffe has two
horns, and the camel has none: But the other
re&s;emblances are &s;o numerous, that I am not &s;ur|pri&s;ed
to &s;ee the appellation of <HI>Indian camel</HI> be|&s;towed
on him by &s;ome travellers. Be&s;ides, we
know not the &s;ub&s;tance of which the horns of
the giraffe are compo&s;ed; and, con&s;equently, we
know not whether by this part he approaches
nearer to the &s;tag or the ox: They may, per|haps,
be a &s;ub&s;tance very different from either.
They may be compo&s;ed of a congeries of hairs,
like the horns of the rhinoceros; or they may
be a &s;ub&s;tance of a peculiar texture. Nomen|clators
&s;eem to have been fir&s;t led into the blun|der
of ranking the giraffe with the &s;tags, by the
pretended pa&s;&s;age of Belon, quoted by Ge&s;ner,
which, if real, would be deci&s;ive of the point:
They appear likewi&s;e to have mi&s;under&s;tood what
has been mentioned by authors concerning the
hair of the&s;e horns. They imagined that the&s;e
writers had &s;aid, that the horns of the giraffe
were clothed with hair, like the new &s;prung
horns of the &s;tag; and hence concluded that
they were of the &s;ame nature. We &s;ee, on the
contrary, from the notes above quoted, that the
horns of the giraffe are only &s;urrounded with
hair, and have a tuft of large coar&s;e hairs at the
<PB N="121" REF="140">
point, and not clothed with a down or velvet,
like tho&s;e of the &s;tag. From this circum&s;tance,
it is not improbable, that the horns of the giraffe
are compo&s;ed of a congeries of hairs nearly in
the &s;ame manner as tho&s;e of the rhinoceros:
Their blunt or truncated points &s;eem to favour
this idea. Be&s;ides, if we con&s;ider that, in all a|nimals
which carry <HI>wood</HI> in&s;tead of horns, as
the elk, the rain-deer, the &s;tag, the roebuck, &amp;c.
this <HI>wood</HI> is always divided into branches or
antlers, and that, on the contrary, the horns of
the giraffe are &s;imple, and con&s;i&s;t but of one
&s;tem, we will be convinced that they are not of
the &s;ame nature, unle&s;s analogy, in this in&s;tance,
be entirely violated. The tubercle on the front,
which appears to be a third horn, &s;trengthens
this opinion. The two horns, which are not
pointed, but blunt at the extremities, are per|haps
only tubercles of a greater length than the
former. The females, according to the te&s;ti|mony
of all travellers, have horns as well as the
males, only they are &s;omewhat &s;maller. If the
giraffe really belonged to the deer-kind, analogy
would again &s;uffer violation; for, among all the
animals of this kind, none of the females, ex|cept
the female rain-deer, have horns, and we
have given the rea&s;on of this phaenomenon. On
the other hand, as the giraffe, on account of the
exce&s;&s;ive height of its limbs, cannot feed upon
herbage, but with great difficulty; as its chief
and almo&s;t only food con&s;i&s;ts of the leaves and
<PB N="122" REF="141">
buds of trees, it may be pre&s;umed, that the &s;ub|&s;tance
of the horns, which are the mo&s;t con&s;pi|cuous
re&s;idue of the organic particles derived
from the food, is analogous to wood, like that
of the &s;tag. Time will confirm one or other of
the&s;e conjectures. A &s;ingle word more added
to Ha&s;&s;elqui&s;t's minute de&s;cription would have
determined the genus of this animal. But &s;chool-boys,
who have only their ma&s;ter's gamut in their
heads, or rather in their pockets, mu&s;t perpetu|ally
blunder, and make the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential omi&s;|&s;ions;
becau&s;e they renounce that &s;pirit of re|&s;earch
which ought to guide every ob&s;erver, and
&s;ee only through the fal&s;e medium of arbitrary
arrangements, which prevents them from reflec|ting
on the nature and relations of the objects
they meet with, and obliges them to de&s;cribe up|on
a bad model. As every object differs mate|rially
from another, the whole &s;hould be treated
in a different manner. A &s;ingle character hap|pily
di&s;covered, is more deci&s;ive, and conveys
more knowledge of the &s;ubject than a thou&s;and
minute and trifling features; for, in proportion
to their number, they nece&s;&s;arily become equi|vocal
and common, and, of cour&s;e &s;uperfluous,
if not hurtful to the real knowledge of Nature,
who &s;ports with the rules we pre&s;cribe to her,
&s;oars above all methodical di&s;tributions, and can
only be perceived by the penetrating eye of ge|nius.</P>

<P>We here give the figure of the giraffe from a
drawing tran&s;mitted to us from the Cape of
Good Hope, which we have rectified in &s;ome
points from the information of Mr Bruce. With
regard to the horns of this animal, we are &s;till
uncertain whether they are permanent like tho&s;e
of the ox, antilope, goat, rhinoceros, &amp;c. or
whether they are annually renewed like tho&s;e
of the deer-kind. They &s;eem to grow during
the fir&s;t years of the animal's life; but they ne|ver
ri&s;e to a great height; for the longe&s;t which
have been &s;een exceeded not twelve or thirteen
inches; and they are generally not above &s;ix or
eight inches. We are indebted to M. Allamand,
a celebrated Profe&s;&s;or at Leyden, for the exact
knowledge we have obtained concerning the&s;e
horns. The following is an extract of a letter
he wrote on this &s;ubject to M. Daubenton, dated
October 31. 1766.</P>
<P>&startq;I have the honour to inform you, that I
am in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a &s;tuffed giraffe. Both
you and M. de Buffon have expre&s;&s;ed a de&s;ire
to know the nature of its horns. I have cut
off one of them, which I &s;end you, that
you may have a more exact idea of it. You
will remark, that this giraffe was very young.
The Governour of the Cape, from whom I re|ceived
<PB N="124" REF="143">
it, writes me, that it was killed when
lying near its mother. Its height is about &s;ix
feet, and its horns, of cour&s;e, are &s;hort, not
exceeding two inches and a half. They are
every where covered with &s;kin and hairs; and
tho&s;e at the point are much longer than the
others, and form a pencil, the height of which
exceeds that of the horn. The ba&s;e of the horn
is more than an inch broad, and con&s;equent|ly
forms an obtu&s;e cone. To di&s;cover whether
it was hollow or &s;olid, I &s;awed it through lon|gitudinally,
along with a portion of the &s;kull
to which it adhered. I found it to be &s;olid,
and a little &s;pongy, becau&s;e it had not yet ac|quired
all its con&s;i&s;tence. Such is its texture,
that it appears not to be compo&s;ed, like that
of the rhinoceros, of hairs united together;
and it re&s;embles the horns of the &s;tag more
than tho&s;e of any other animal. I would even
&s;ay, that there is no difference between the&s;e
two &s;ub&s;tances, if I were certain, that a horn,
lately &s;ent to me under that name, was really
the horn of a giraffe. It is &s;traight, half a
foot long, and pretty much pointed. There
&s;till remain &s;ome ve&s;tiges of the &s;kin with
which it had been covered; and it differs from
a &s;tag's horn only in figure. If the&s;e ob|&s;ervations
are not &s;ufficient, I &s;hall with plea|&s;ure
&s;end you the two horns, that you may
examine them along with M. de Buffon. With
regard to this animal, I &s;hould farther remark,
<PB N="125" REF="144">
that the alledged difference between its fore
and hind legs &s;eems to be greatly exaggera|ted;
for it is hardly perceptible in my young
giraffe.&endq;</P>
<P>Be&s;ide the&s;e horns which are found on the
head of the female giraffe, as well as on that of
the male, there is, at almo&s;t an equal di&s;tance
between the no&s;trils and eyes, a remarkable ex|cre&s;cence,
which &s;eems to be a bone covered
with a &s;oft &s;kin, and garni&s;hed with &s;mooth
hair. This o&s;&s;eous excre&s;cence is more than
three inches long, and is much inclined toward
the front, or makes a very acute angle with the

robe is a bright &s;hining yellow, and the &s;pots
are, in general, rhomboidal.</P>
<P>It is extremely probable, from the in&s;pection
of the&s;e horns, which are &s;olid, and re&s;emble in
&s;ub&s;tance the horns of the &s;tag, that the giraffe
may be ranked in the &s;ame genus: Of this there
could not remain a doubt, if we were certain
that he &s;hed his horns annually. But it is now
unque&s;tionable that he ought to be &s;eparated
from the ox-kind, and other animals who&s;e
horns are hollow. Meanwhile, we &s;hall con&s;i|der
this large and beautiful animal as con&s;tituting
a particular and &s;olitary genus, which corre&s;ponds
very well with the other facts in Nature, who,
in voluminous &s;pecies, never doubles her pro|ductions.
The elephant, the rhinoceros, the
hippopotamus, and perhaps the giraffe, are ani|mals
<PB N="126" REF="145">
forming particular genera, or &s;olitary &s;pe|cies,
who have no collaterals. This is a privi|lege
which &s;eems to be conferred &s;olely on ani|mals
which greatly &s;urpa&s;s all others in magni|tude.</P>
<P>In a letter I received from Holland, the &s;ub|&s;cription
of which was illegible, I had the fol|lowing
de&s;cription of a giraffe.</P>
<P>&startq;Africa produces no animal more beautiful
or more curious than the giraffe. From the
point of the no&s;e to the tail, he is twenty-five
feet long. He has received the name of <HI>Ca|melopard,</HI>
becau&s;e he &s;omewhat re&s;embles the
camel in the figure of his head, the length of
his neck, &amp;c. and becau&s;e his robe is variega|ted
with irregular &s;pots, like that of the leo|pard.
He is found at twenty-four leagues
from the Cape of Good Hope, and is &s;till
more frequent at greater di&s;tances. The teeth
of this animal are &s;imilar to tho&s;e of the &s;tag.
His horns are a foot long: They are &s;traight
as a man's arm, garni&s;hed with hair, and &s;eem
to be truncated at their extremities. The neck
con&s;titutes at lea&s;t one half of the length of
the animal, which, in figure, pretty much re|&s;embles
that of a hor&s;e. The tail would al&s;o
be pretty &s;imilar, if it were equally furni&s;hed
with hair as that of the hor&s;e. The legs are
like tho&s;e of the &s;tag; the feet are garni&s;hed
with very black, obtu&s;e, and widely &s;eparated
hoofs. When the animal leaps, he fir&s;t rai&s;es
<PB N="127" REF="146">
the two fore feet, and then tho&s;e behind, as a
hor&s;e would do who had his two fore feet
tied together. He runs &s;lowly, and with a
bad grace: He may be ea&s;ily overtaken in the
chace. He carries his head always high, and
feeds only on the leaves of trees, being unable
to pa&s;ture on the ground, on account of his
great height. When he drinks, he is obliged
to re&s;t on his knees. The females are gene|rally
of a bright yellow colour, and the males
of a browni&s;h yellow. Some of them are
nearly white, with brown or black &s;pots.&endq;</P>

<HEAD>Supplement from Schneider's Edition.</HEAD>
<P>&startq;M. de Buffon, with much propriety, blames
our modern nomenclators, becau&s;e, when treat|ing
of the giraffe, they are &s;ilent with regard
to the nature of his horns, which alone can
form a criterion to a&s;certain the &s;pecies to
which he belongs; and becau&s;e they give dry
and minute de&s;criptions, without adding a
figure. We &s;hall endeavour to &s;upply both
the&s;e defects.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;M. Allamand, profe&s;&s;or of natural hi&s;tory
in the univer&s;ity of Leyden, is in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of
the &s;tuffed &s;kin of a young giraffe. He o|bligingly
communicated to us a drawing of it,
which we cau&s;ed to be engraven; and he add|ed
the following de&s;cription.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="128" REF="147">
&startq;M. Tulbagh, Governor of the Cape of Good
Hope, who has enriched our academical ca|binet
with many rare productions of nature,
writes me, that the young giraffe in our po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion
was killed by his hunters at a con&s;ide|rable
di&s;tance from the Cape, when lying near
its mother, whom it &s;till &s;ucked. Hence it
appears, that the giraffe is not peculiar to Aethi|opia,
as Thevenot has alledged.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;As &s;oon as I received it, I examined the
horns, with a view to elucidate M. de Buffon's
doubt with regard to their &s;ub&s;tance. They
are not hollow like tho&s;e of oxen and goats,
but &s;olid, and nearly of an uniform texture,
like tho&s;e of the &s;tags, from which they differ
only in being thinner, &s;traighter, and not di|vided
into branches, or antlers. They are
totally covered with the &s;kin of the animal;
and, for three fourths of their length, this &s;kin
is furni&s;hed with &s;hort hair, &s;imilar to that
which covers the body. Toward the points,
the hair becomes longer, ri&s;es about three
inches above the blunt end of the horns, and is
of a black colour. Hence it is very different
from the down on the young horns of the
&s;tag.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;The&s;e horns appear not to be compo&s;ed of
united hairs, like tho&s;e of the rhinoceros.
Their texture is likewi&s;e totally different.
When &s;awn through longitudinally, we per|ceive
that they con&s;i&s;t of a hard plate, which
<PB N="129" REF="148">
con&s;titutes their external &s;urface, and inclo&s;es
a &s;pongy &s;ub&s;tance. This, at lea&s;t, is the ca&s;e
with the horns of my young giraffe. Perhaps
the horns of adults are more &s;olid. M. de
Buffon is now in a condition to determine this
point; for, along with the horns of my giraffe,
I &s;ent him another belonging to one more ad|vanced
in years, which a friend of mine re|ceived
from the Ea&s;t Indies.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Though the&s;e horns are &s;olid, like tho&s;e of
the &s;tag, I &s;u&s;pect that the animal does not
&s;hed them annually. They &s;eem to be an ex|cre&s;cence
of the frontal bone, like the bone
which &s;erves as a nucleus to the hollow horns
of oxen and goats; and, con&s;equently, it is
impo&s;&s;ible that they can fall off. If this con|jecture
be well founded, the giraffe con&s;titutes
a particular genus, perfectly di&s;tinct from the
animals who &s;hed their horns, and al&s;o from
tho&s;e who have hollow, but permanent horns.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;In the middle of the front of adult giraffes,
there is a protuberance which &s;eems to be the
rudiments of a third horn. No &s;uch protu|berance
appeared in our giraffe; probably be|cau&s;e
it was too young.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;All the authors, both antient and modern,
who de&s;cribe this animal, tell us, that the fore
legs are twice as long as the hind ones. They
could not po&s;&s;ibly be deceived concerning a
character &s;o &s;triking. But I can affirm, that,
in this article, the giraffe mu&s;t change greatly
<PB N="130" REF="149">
in growing; for, in our young one, the hind
legs were equally long with tho&s;e before.
This circum&s;tance, however, prevents not the
anterior part of the giraffe from being higher
than the po&s;terior, which is owing to the dif|ference
in the thickne&s;s of the body, as may
be &s;een in the figure. But this difference is
by no means &s;o great as has been repre&s;ented.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;The neck of the giraffe is the fir&s;t thing
which &s;trikes a &s;pectator. It is longer than
that of any other quadruped, not excepting
the camel, who, be&s;ides, folds his neck in dif|ferent
ways, which the giraffe &s;eems to be in|capable
of performing.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;His colour is a dirty white, inter&s;per&s;ed
with yellowi&s;h &s;pots, very near each other on
the neck, more di&s;tant on the re&s;t of the body,
and of a figure which approaches to a paral|lelogram
or rhomb.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;The tail is &s;lender, in proportion to the
length and &s;tature of the animal. Its extre|mity
is garni&s;hed with a tuft of black hairs,
which are &s;even or eight inches long.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;The mane is compo&s;ed of reddi&s;h hair,
three inches long, and inclined toward the
hind part of the body. It extends from the
head along the neck, and down to the middle
of the back; and, at the di&s;tance of &s;ome
inches, it is again continued; but the hair in|clines
toward the head. It &s;eems to recom|mence
near the origin, and to extend to the
<PB N="131" REF="150">
extremity of the tail: But the hairs are &s;hort,
and &s;carcely to be di&s;tingui&s;hed from tho&s;e
which cover the re&s;t of the body.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;The eye-lids, both &s;uperior and inferior,
are garni&s;hed with a range of very &s;tiff hairs.
There are &s;imilar hairs, but thinly &s;cattered,
round the mouth.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;The a&s;pect of the giraffe indicates a mild
and docile animal; and this is the character
given of him by tho&s;e who have &s;een him
alive.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;This de&s;cription of the giraffe, added to
what M. de Buffon has collected from diffe|rent
authors, and accompanied with the fi|gure,
is &s;ufficient to give us more exact ideas
concerning this animal than we had hitherto
obtained.&endq;</P>
<P>M. Alamand's great knowledge and accuracy,
in every &s;ubject of which he treats, are apparent
from the above de&s;cription. I would have co|pied
his engraving, if his giraffe had not been
too young. The figure I have given is that of
an adult. I &s;hall only remark, that I &s;u&s;pect
the longe&s;t of the horns he was &s;o obliging as
to &s;end me, does not belong to a giraffe. The
&s;hort ones are very thick, while it is very thin,
in proportion to their re&s;pective lengths. In the
anonymous de&s;cription above related, it is &s;aid,
that the horns of the adult giraffes are <HI>a foot in
length, and as thick as a man's arm.</HI> If the horn
under con&s;ideration, which is half a foot long,
<PB N="132" REF="151">
really belonged to a giraffe, it ought to be
double its pre&s;ent thickne&s;s. Be&s;ides, this pre|tended
horn of a giraffe is &s;o &s;imilar to the fir&s;t
horns of a young &s;tag, that it may be regarded
as belonging to the latter animal.</P>
<P>As to the nature of the giraffe's horns, I am
inclined to adopt M. Alamand's opinion. The
protuberance on the front, which is unque&s;tion|ably
o&s;&s;eous, makes a kind of third horn. The
horns adhered to the cranium, without the &s;up|port
of moulds; and, con&s;equently, ought to be
con&s;idered as o&s;&s;eous prolongations of the bones
of the head. The hair which &s;urrounds and
overtops them has no re&s;emblance to that which
covers the young &s;hoots of the &s;tag, or fallow
deer. This hair &s;eems to be permanent, as well
as the &s;kin from which it i&s;&s;ues. Hence the
horn of the giraffe is a bone, and differs from
that of the ox by its covering, the latter being
&s;urrounded with a horny &s;ub&s;tance, or hollow
horn, and the former with hair and &s;kin.

<P>IN all languages, two names are frequently
be&s;towed on the &s;ame animal, one of which
relates to its &s;tate of liberty, and the other to its
<PB N="134" REF="154">
dome&s;tic &s;tate. The wild boar and hog are the
&s;ame animal, and the&s;e two names have no re|lation
to any difference in the nature of the crea|tures,
but to the condition of the &s;pecies, one
part of which is under the dominion of man,
and the other independent. The &s;ame remark
applies to the lamas and pacos, which were the
only dome&s;tic animals<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Before the arrival of the Spaniards, the Indians of Peru had no dome&s;tic animals but the pacos and the huanacus; <HI>Hi&s;t. des Incas, p.</HI> 265.</NOTE> of the antient Ameri|cans:

<PB N="135" REF="155">
animals are peculiar to the New World: They
even love particular lands, beyond which they
are never found. They appear to be confined
to that chain of mountains which extends from
New Spain to Terra Magellancia. They inha|bit
the mo&s;t elevated regions of this globe, and
&s;eem to require a lighter air than that of our
highe&s;t mountains.</P>
<P>It is &s;ingular, that, though the lama and pacos
are dome&s;tic in Peru, Mexico, and Chili, as the
hor&s;e is in Europe, or the camel in Arabia, we
have hardly any knowledge of them; and that,
though the Spaniards have had the dominion of
the&s;e va&s;t countries for more than two centuries,
none of their authors have given a complete hi|&s;tory
and exact de&s;cription of the&s;e animals. It
is alledged, indeed, that they cannot be tran&s;|ported
into Europe, nor even de&s;cend from their
mountains, without peri&s;hing in a &s;hort time.
But, in Quito, Lima, and other towns, where
men of letters re&s;ide, the&s;e animals might be
drawn, de&s;cribed, and di&s;&s;ected. Herrera<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">In the mountains of Peru there is a &s;pecies of camel, the wool of which is manufactured into cloth; <HI>De&s;cript. des Indes Occidentales, par Herrera, p.</HI> 244.</NOTE> &s;ays

<P>Peru, according to Gregoire de Bolivar, is the
native country of the lamas: They have, indeed,
been brought into other provinces, as New Spain,
where, however, they are regarded more as ob|jects
of curio&s;ity than of utility. But, through
the whole extent of Peru, from Poto&s;i to Cara|cas,
the&s;e animals are extremely numerous. They
con&s;titute the &s;ole wealth of the Indians, and con|tribute
not a little to that of the Spaniards. The
fle&s;h of the lamas is good eating; their wool
is excellent; and their whole lives are &s;pent
in tran&s;porting the commodities of the country.
Their common load is a hundred and fifty pounds,
and the &s;tronge&s;t of them carry two hundred.
They travel pretty long journies in a country
impa&s;&s;able to all other animals. They march
&s;lowly, and &s;eldom accompli&s;h more than four
or five leagues a day. Their gait is grave and
firm. They de&s;cend precipitous ravins, and
climb &s;teep rocks, where even man him&s;elf
dares not accompany them. They walk com|monly
four or five days on end, after which
they wi&s;h to repo&s;e; and they &s;pontaneou&s;ly
re&s;t twenty-four or thirty hours before they
re&s;ume their march. They are much employed
in tran&s;porting the rich ores dug out of the mines
of Poto&s;i. Bolivar remarks, that, in his time,
<PB N="139" REF="159">
three hundred thou&s;and of the&s;e animals were
con&s;tantly occupied in this work.</P>
<P>Their growth is quick, and their life is not of
long duration. At the age of three years, they
are in a condition of producing, continue in full
vigour till twelve, when they begin to decay;
and, at fifteen, they are entirely u&s;ele&s;s. Their
natural di&s;po&s;ition &s;eems to be modelled upon
that of the Americans. They are mild and
phlegmatic, and perform every thing by weight
and mea&s;ure. When they incline to re&s;t a few
minutes in their journey, they bend their knees,
and lower their bodies with the greate&s;t precau|tion,
to prevent their load from falling, or being
deranged; and, whenever they hear their con|ductor's
whi&s;tle, they ri&s;e with the &s;ame precau|tion,
and proceed on their journey. In going
along, they brow&s;e wherever they find herbage;
but they never eat in the night, even though
they have been &s;paringly fed during the day;
for this time is &s;pent in chewing their cud. When
they &s;leep or ruminate, they re&s;t on their brea&s;t,
with their legs folded under their belly. When
fatigued with travelling, if they once &s;ink down
under the load, no blows can force them to ri&s;e.
The la&s;t re&s;ource is to &s;queeze their te&s;ticles;
but even that is often ineffectual. They remain
ob&s;tinately where they lie; and, if their ma&s;ter
continues to abu&s;e them, they de&s;pair and kill
them&s;elves, by alternately &s;triking their heads from
right to left upon the ground. They neither defend
<PB N="140" REF="160">
them&s;elves with their feet nor their teeth, and
they may be &s;aid to have no other arms but tho&s;e
of indignation. They &s;pit in the face of tho&s;e
who in&s;ult them; and, it is alledged, that the
&s;aliva which they throw out when enraged, is &s;o
acrid as to rai&s;e bli&s;ters on the &s;kin.</P>
<P>The lama is about four feet high, and his bo|dy,
including the neck and head, is five or &s;ix
feet in length. This animal has a well &s;haped
head, large eyes, a pretty long muzzle, and thick
lips, the &s;uperior one being divided, and the in|ferior
&s;omewhat pendulous. He has neither
cutting nor canine teeth in the upper jaw. His
ears are four inches long, which he carries for|ward,
erect, and moves at plea&s;ure. The length
of his tail, which is &s;traight, &s;lender, and a little
rai&s;ed, exceeds not eight inches. His feet are
cloven, like tho&s;e of the ox; but they are arm|ed
behind with a &s;pur, which a&s;&s;i&s;ts the animal
in &s;upporting it&s;elf upon rugged and difficult
ground. The wool upon his back, crupper, and
tail, is &s;hort, but very long upon the flank and
belly. The lamas vary in colour; &s;ome of them
are white, others black, and others of a mixed
colour<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">The head of the lama is proportionally &s;mall, and has &s;ome re&s;emblance to that of the goat and &s;heep. The upper lip is divided like that of the hare: Through this aperture they &s;pit, to the di&s;tance of ten paces, upon tho&s;e who di|&s;turb them; and, if the &s;aliva falls upon the face, it inflames or bli&s;ters the &s;kin. They have a long neck, which bends downward where it &s;prings from the body, like that of the camel, to which they would have a con&s;iderable re&s;emblance, if they had a bunch on the back. Their height is about four feet and a half. They walk with their head erect, and with a pace &s;o uniform, that even blows are incapable of making them move more quickly. They will not carry their loads du|ring the night; but are obliged to be unloaded, in order to allow them to pa&s;ture. They eat little, and are never furni&s;h|ed with drink. Like the &s;heep, they have cloven feet, and a &s;pur above, which renders them &s;ure-footed among the rocks. Their wool has a &s;trong odour: It is long, &s;potted with white, gray, and red, and equally beautiful, though of an inferior quality, with that of the pacos; <HI>Voyage de Frezier, p.</HI> 138.</NOTE>.

and yet they copulate with much difficulty. The
aperture of the female is very &s;mall. She pro|&s;trates
her&s;elf to receive the male, and invites
him with her &s;ighs. But &s;everal hours, and
&s;ometimes a whole day pa&s;&s;es, before they can

are more fatiguing than the operation it&s;elf, their
keeper abridges their labour, and aids their ar|rangement
with his hand. They &s;eldom pro|duce
more than one at a time. The mother has
only two teats, and the young one follows her
the moment after it is brought forth. The fle&s;h
of the young ones is very good; but, when old,
it is dry and hard. The fle&s;h of the dome&s;tic is
better than that of the wild lamas, and their
wool is likewi&s;e much &s;ofter. Their &s;kin is
very compact: The Indians make &s;hoes of it,
and the Spaniards u&s;e it for harne&s;&s;es. The food
of the&s;e animals, which are &s;o u&s;eful in the
country that produces them, co&s;ts almo&s;t no|thing.
As they are cloven-footed, they require
no &s;hoes; and the thick wool with which they
are covered, renders &s;addles unnece&s;&s;ary. They
have no need of corn or hay; green herbage,
of which they take but &s;mall quantities<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">The &s;kin of the huanacus is hard: The Indians &s;often it with grea&s;e, and u&s;e it for &s;oles to their &s;hoes. But as this leather is not curried, it is &s;oon wa&s;ted by the rain: The Spaniards make fine harne&s;&s;es to their hor&s;es of the lama's hide: They employ the&s;e animals, as the Indians do, in tran&s;|porting their merchandi&s;e. Their common route is from Cozer to Poto&s;i, which is about two hundred leagues, and their daily journey &s;eldom exceeds three leagues; for they walk &s;lowly, and, if pu&s;hed beyond their ordinary pace, they he down, and it is impo&s;&s;ible to rai&s;e them, even when the load is taken off their backs; &s;o that they often die on the &s;pot.... When tran&s;porting goods, they go in troops, and forty or fifty of them are always left unloaded, in order in|&s;tantly to relieve tho&s;e which begin to be fatigued. The fle&s;h of this animal is excellent; for it is both well ta&s;ted and whole|&s;ome, e&s;pecially that of the young ones, who exceed not four or five months old.... Though the&s;e animals are very numerous, their food co&s;ts almo&s;t nothing; for, after their journey, they are unloaded, and allowed to pa&s;ture in the fields. It is un|nece&s;&s;ary to &s;hoe or &s;addle them; for they are cloven footed; and their wool prevents them from being incommoded by their load, which their ma&s;ters take care not to place on their back-bone, otherwi&s;e it would kill them.... The conduc|tors of the&s;e animals never enter the towns, but &s;leep in tents, that their cattle may have an opportunity of pa&s;turing during the night. They take four months in performing a journey from Cozer to Poto&s;i, two in going, and as much in returning.... At Cozer, the be&s;t lamas &s;ell at eighteen ducats a piece, and the common &s;ort at twelve or thirteen. The fle&s;h of the wild huanacus is good, but inferior to that of the do|me&s;tic kind; <HI>Hi&s;t. des Incas, tom. 2. p.</HI> 260.</NOTE>, being
<PB N="143" REF="163">
&s;ufficient for their nouri&s;hment. In drinking,
they are &s;till more moderate. They quench
their thir&s;t with their &s;aliva, which, in this ani|mal,
is more abundant than in any other.</P>
<P>The huanacus, or lamas in a &s;tate of nature,
are &s;tronger, more active, and nimbler than the
dome&s;tic kind. They run like the &s;tag, and, like
the wild goat, they climb the &s;teepe&s;t rocks.
Though in full po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of liberty, they a&s;|&s;emble
in flocks, &s;ometimes to the number of
two or three hundred. When they perceive any
per&s;on, they look at him with a&s;toni&s;hment, di&s;|covering
neither fear nor plea&s;ure: They then
blow through their no&s;trils, neigh nearly like a
hor&s;e, and fly off together to the tops of the
mountains. They prefer the north &s;ide and the
cold regions of the hills. They often climb and

&s;ojourn above the line of the &s;now. When tra|velling
on ice and covered with hoar-fro&s;t, they
are in better plight than in a temperate climate.
In the Sierras, which are the mo&s;t elevated part
of the Cordelieres, they are much more nume|rous,
and have more &s;trength and vigour than
in the Lanos, which are lower. The&s;e wild
lamas are hunted for the &s;ake of their fleeces.
It is difficult for the dogs to follow them; and,
if allowed time to gain the rocks, both the hun|ters
and dogs are obliged to abandon them. They
&s;eem to be as much afraid of the weight of the
air as of heat; for they are never found in low
lands: And, as the chain of the Cordelieres,
which is more than three thou&s;and fathoms above
the level of the &s;ea at Peru, pre&s;erves nearly the
&s;ame elevation from Chili to the &s;traits of Ma|gellan,

except the dome&s;tic kind which are brought
thither.</P>
<P>The pacos are a &s;pecies which may &s;upply
that of the lamas, as the a&s;s might &s;upply the
place of the hor&s;e. They are &s;maller, and le&s;s
proper for labour; but their fleeces are more
u&s;eful. The long wool with which they are
covered, is an article of luxury, as good and as
precious as &s;ilk. The pacos, which are al&s;o cal|led
<HI>alpaques,</HI> when in a dome&s;tic &s;tate, are often
totally black, and &s;ometimes of a brown colour
mixed with yellow. The wild pacos have the
colour of dried ro&s;es; and this natural colour is
&s;o fixed, that it &s;uffers no change from the hand
of the workman. Their wool makes excellent
gloves, &s;tockings, bed-clothes, and carpets. This
commodity alone con&s;titutes a valuable branch
of commerce to the Spaniards. The beaver of
Canada, the Calmuck &s;heep, and the Syrian goat,
furni&s;h not a finer hair: That of the pacos is
as dear as &s;ilk. This animal po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es many
things in common with the lama. It belongs
exclu&s;ively to the &s;ame country; for it exi&s;ts no
where but on the Cordelieres. It has likewi&s;e
the &s;ame di&s;po&s;itions, and nearly the &s;ame man|ners
and temperament. As its wool, however,
is longer and more bu&s;hy, it &s;eems to be &s;till le&s;s
afraid of cold. It dwells more freely among
the &s;nows and ice of cold countries, and is ex|tremely
numerous in Terra Magellanica<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">On the ea&s;t coa&s;t of Patagonia, near the river Plata, the vigognes are very numerous.

The pacos al&s;o re&s;emble the lama in figure;
but they are &s;maller, their legs are &s;horter, and
their muzzle is more contracted. Their wool
is of the colour of dried ro&s;es. They have no
horns. They live and pa&s;ture on the mo&s;t ele|vated
parts of the mountains. Snow and ice
&s;eem rather to refre&s;h than incommode them.
They go in flocks, and run nimbly. They are
very timid; and, when they perceive any per|&s;on,
they fly off, driving their young before
them. The hunting of the pacos was rigorou&s;|ly
prohibited by the antient kings of Peru, be|cau&s;e
the&s;e animals do not multiply fa&s;t. At
pre&s;ent, they are much le&s;s numerous than at the
time the Spaniards fir&s;t took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of that
country. Their fle&s;h is not &s;o good as that of
the huanacus; and they are &s;ought after &s;olely
for the &s;ake of their wool, and the bezoars which
they produce. The manner of taking them
&s;hows their timidity, or perhaps their weakne&s;s.
Several people a&s;&s;emble to chace the&s;e animals
in &s;ome narrow de&s;ile, acro&s;s which cords are
&s;tretched to the height of three or four feet, with
pieces of linen or woollen cloth fixed upon them.
When the pacos arrive, the motion of the pieces
of cloth, produced by the wind, &s;o terrifies them,
that they dare not pa&s;s, but collect in large groups,
<PB N="147" REF="167">
which makes it an ea&s;y bu&s;ine&s;s to kill va&s;t
numbers of them. But, if there happen to be
any huanacus in the flock, as they are taller and
le&s;s timid than the pacos, they &s;pring over the
cords; and, when the example is once &s;et, the
pacos likewi&s;e leap and e&s;cape from the hun|ters<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Voyage de Frezier, p. 138.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>With regard to the dome&s;tic pacos, they are
employed, like the lamas, in carrying burdens;
but they cannot bear as much weight even in
proportion to their &s;ize. They are &s;till more
&s;ubject to capricious ob&s;tinacy. When once
they lie down with their load, rather than ri&s;e,
they will &s;uffer them&s;elves to be cut in pieces.
The Indians make no u&s;e of the milk of the&s;e
animals; becau&s;e they never yield more than is
nece&s;&s;ary to fuckle their young. The great pro|fits
derived from their wool induced the Spa|niards
to endeavour to naturalize the pacos in
Europe. They were tran&s;ported into Spain; but
the climate de&s;troyed them<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;t. des aventures des Flibu&s;tiers, p. 367.</NOTE>. I am per&s;uaded,
however, as I formerly remarked, that the&s;e ani|mals
might &s;ucceed in our mountains, and par|ticularly
in the Pyrennees. Tho&s;e who brought
them to Spain did not con&s;ider that, even in
Peru, they &s;ub&s;i&s;t only in the cold region, or
upon the tops of the highe&s;t mountains; that
they are never found in low lands; that they die
in warm countries; that, on the contrary, they
<PB N="148" REF="168">
are at pre&s;ent very numerous in the neighbour|hood
of the &s;traits of Magellan, where the cold
is much more inten&s;e than in the &s;outh of Eu|rope;
and, con&s;equently, that, in order to pre|&s;erve
them, they &s;hould be landed, not in Spain,
but in Scotland, or even in Norway. The foot
of the Pyrennees, Alps, &amp;c. would probably an|&s;wer
the intention &s;till better, where they could
climb to the region which was mo&s;t agreeable to
their con&s;titution. I have dwelt the longer on
this &s;ubject, becau&s;e I imagine that the&s;e animals
would be a great acqui&s;ition to Europe, and
would be productive of more real advantage than
all the metals of the New World, which only

The <HI>vigogne,</HI> or wild pacos, produces a great
number, as well as the huanacus. The&s;e &s;tones
are likewi&s;e produced by the &s;tags and roebucks
on the mountains of New Spain. The lamas
and pacos produce no fine bezoars, unle&s;s when
in their natural wild &s;tate. The dome&s;tic kind
afford only &s;mall, black bezoars, without any
virtue. The be&s;t &s;tones are of a dark green co|lour,
and generally proceed from the wild pacos,
particularly tho&s;e which inhabit the highe&s;t parts
of the mountains, and commonly pa&s;ture among
the &s;nows. Of the&s;e mountain pacos, both the
males and females produce bezoars. They hold
the fir&s;t rank after the oriental bezoars, and are
in much higher e&s;timation than tho&s;e of New

they walk. Though they re&s;emble each other
in many re&s;pects, they differ, both externally
and internally, by characters &s;o marked, that it is
<PB N="151" REF="171">
impo&s;&s;ible not to recogni&s;e them as very di|&s;tinct
&s;pecies. The unau, or two-toed &s;loth,
has no tail, and only two claws on the fore-feet:
The a&iuml;, or three-toed &s;loth, has a tail, and three
claws on all the feet. The muzzle of the for|mer
is longer, the front more elevated, and the
ears more apparent than tho&s;e of the latter.
Their hair is al&s;o very different. The &s;tructure
<PB N="152" REF="172">
and &s;ituation of &s;ome parts of their vi&s;cera are
likewi&s;e different. But the mo&s;t remarkable
di&s;tinction is derived from this &s;ingular circum|&s;tance,
that the unau has forty-&s;ix ribs, and the
a&iuml; only twenty-eight, which &s;hows them to be
&s;pecies very remote from each other. This num|ber
of ribs, in the body of an animal &s;o &s;hort, is
an exce&s;s or error of Nature; for no animal,
however large, has &s;uch a number of ribs: The
elephant has only forty, the hor&s;e thirty-&s;ix,
the badger thirty, the dog twenty-&s;ix, man
twenty-four, &amp;c. This difference in the &s;truc|ture
of the &s;loths indicates a greater di&s;tance
between the&s;e two &s;pecies than between the dog
and cat, who have both the &s;ame number of
ribs; for external differences are nothing when
compared to tho&s;e which are internal: The
former may be regarded as cau&s;es, and the lat|ter
as effects only. The interior frame of ani|mated
beings is the foundation of Nature's plan;
it is the con&s;tituent form, and the origin of all
figure: But the external parts are only the
&s;urface or drapery. How often have we not
found, in the cour&s;e of our comparative exami|nation
of animals, that a very different exter|nal
appearance covered internal parts perfectly
&s;imilar; and that, on the contrary, the &s;lighte&s;t
internal di&s;tinction produced great external dif|ferences,
and changed the natural di&s;po&s;itions,
powers, and qualities of the animal? How many
animals are armed, covered, and adorned with ex|cre&s;cent
<PB N="153" REF="173">
parts, who&s;e external &s;tructure corre|&s;ponds
exactly with others which are totally de|prived
of &s;uch appendages? But this is not a
proper place for &s;uch nice di&s;qui&s;itions. We
&s;hall only remark, that, in proportion as Nature
is vivacious, active, and exalted in the monkey
kind, &s;he is &s;low, re&s;trained, and fettered in the
&s;loths. From a defect in their conformation,
the mi&s;ery of the&s;e animals is not more con&s;pi|cuous
than their &s;lowne&s;s. They have no cut|ting
teeth; the eyes are ob&s;cured with hair; the
chops are heavy and thick; the hair is flat,
and re&s;embles withered herbs; the thighs are ill
jointed to the haunches; the legs are too &s;hort,
ill turned, and terminated &s;till wor&s;e: Their
feet have no &s;oles, and no toes which move &s;e|parately,
but only two or three claws di&s;propor|tionally
long, and bended downward, which
move together, and are more hurtful to their
walking, than advantageous in a&s;&s;i&s;ting them to
climb. Slowne&s;s, habitual pain, and &s;tupidity,
are the re&s;ults of this &s;trange and bungled con|formation.
The &s;loths have no weapons either
offen&s;ive or defen&s;ive. They are furni&s;hed with
no means of &s;afety; for they can neither fly nor
dig the earth. Confined to a &s;mall &s;pace, or to
the tree under which they are brought forth,
they are pri&s;oners in the mid&s;t of &s;pace, and
cannot move the length of one fathom in an
hour<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Perillo ligero, &s;ive canicula agilis, animal e&s;t omnium quae viderim ignavi&s;&s;imum; nam adeo lente movetur, ut ad conficiendum iter longum dumtaxat quinquaginta pa&s;&s;us, in|tegro die illi opus &s;it.&mdash;In aedes tran&s;latum naturali &s;ua tarditate movetur, nec a clamatione ulla aut impul&s;ione gra|dum accelerat; <HI>Oviedo in &s;ummario Ind.

much labour and pain. Their cry and inter|rupted
accents they dare only utter during the

night. All the&s;e circum&s;tances announce the
mi&s;ery of the &s;loths, and recall to our minds tho&s;e
defective mon&s;ters, tho&s;e imperfect &s;ketches of
Nature, which, being hardly endowed with the
faculty of exi&s;tence, could not &s;ub&s;i&s;t for any
length of time, and have accordingly been &s;truck
out of the li&s;t of beings. If the regions inhabit|ed
by the &s;loths were not de&s;ert, but had been
long occupied by men and the larger animals,
the&s;e &s;pecies would never have de&s;cended to
our times: They would have been annihilated,
as in &s;ome future period will be the ca&s;e. We
formerly remarked, that every thing that po&s;&s;i|bly
could be, really did exi&s;t; of which the &s;loths
are a &s;triking example. They con&s;titute the la&s;t
term of exi&s;tence in the order of animals en|dowed
with fle&s;h and blood. One other defect
added to the number would have totally prevent|ed
their exi&s;tence. To regard tho&s;e bungled
&s;ketches as beings equally perfect with others,
to call in the aid of final cau&s;es to account
for &s;uch di&s;proportioned productions, and to
make Nature as brilliant in the&s;e as in her mo&s;t
beautiful animals, is to view her through a nar|row
tube, and to &s;ub&s;titute our own fancies for
her intentions.</P>
<P>Why &s;hould not &s;ome animals be created for
mi&s;ery, &s;ince, in the human &s;pecies, the greate&s;t
number of individuals are devoted to pain from
the moment of their exi&s;tence? Evil, it is true,
proceeds more from our&s;elves than from Nature.
<PB N="156" REF="176">
For a &s;ingle per&s;on who is unhappy, becau&s;e he
was born feeble or deformed, there are millions
rendered mi&s;erable by the oppre&s;&s;ion of their &s;u|periors.
The animals, in general, are more hap|py,
becau&s;e the &s;pecies have nothing to fear from
individuals: To them there is but one &s;ource of
evil; to man there are two. Moral evil, of
which he him&s;elf is the fountain, has accumu|lated
into an immen&s;e ocean, which covers and
afflicts the whole &s;urface of the earth. Phy&s;ical
evil, on the contrary, is re&s;trained within very
narrow bounds: It &s;eldom appears alone; for it
is always accompanied with an equal, if not a
&s;uperior good. Can happine&s;s be denied to ani|mals,
when they enjoy freedom, have the facul|ty
of procuring &s;ub&s;i&s;tence with ea&s;e, and po&s;&s;e&s;s
more health, and organs capable of affording
greater plea&s;ure than tho&s;e of the human &s;pecies?
Now, the generality of animals are mo&s;t liberally
endowed with all the&s;e &s;ources of enjoyment.
The degraded &s;pecies of &s;loths are perhaps the
only creatures to whom Nature has been unkind,
and who exhibit to us the picture of innate mi|&s;ery.</P>
<P>Let us take a clo&s;er view of the condition of
the&s;e creatures. By the want of teeth, they can
neither &s;eize prey, nor feed upon fle&s;h or her|bage.
Reduced to the nece&s;&s;ity of living upon
leaves and wild fruits, they con&s;ume much time
in trailing their bodies to the foot of a tree, and
<PB N="157" REF="177">
&s;till more in climbing to the branches<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">It is alledged by the natives, that this animal lives &s;olely on the leaves of a certain tree, called in their language <HI>Ama|hut.</HI> This tree is higher than any other in that country. Its leaves are very &s;mall and delicate; and, becau&s;e the &s;loth is commonly found in the&s;e trees, they have given it the name of <HI>Haut; Singul&punc; de la France Antarc, par Thevet, p.</HI> 100.&mdash;The &s;loth lives &s;olely on the leaves of trees, and the highe&s;t bran|ches &s;erve him for a retreat; but it co&s;ts him two days jour|ney to arrive at them.... Neither care&s;&s;es, threatenings, nor even blows, can make him move quicker; <HI>Hi&s;t. des Indes, par Maff&eacute;, p. 71. Herrera, p.</HI> 252.&mdash;The &s;loth is not &s;o large, nor &s;o rough as the <HI>tamanoir,</HI> or great ant-eater.... He feeds upon leaves.... The&s;e animals do much mi&s;chief to trees; after eating all the leaves of one tree, they employ five or &s;ix days in de&s;cending it and climbing another, however nearly &s;ituated; and, though plump and fat when they be|gin their journey, they are reduced to &s;kin and bone before they fini&s;h it. They never abandon a tree till they have made it as bare as it can be in the middle of winter; <HI>Dampier's Voyage.</HI>&mdash;They climb trees, but &s;o &s;lowly, that they are ea&s;ily taken. When &s;eized, they make no re&s;i&s;tance, and never attempt to fly. If a long pole is pre&s;ented to the &s;loth, he begins to mount it; but the &s;lowne&s;s of his motion is tire&s;ome: When he arrives at the top, he remains there, without taking the trouble of de|&s;cending; <HI>Voyage de Cayenne, par Binet, p.</HI> 341.&mdash;The &s;loths have four legs, which they employ only in climbing: When perched upon a tree, they never quit it till they have eat the whole leaves. They then de&s;cend, and mount another, the leaves of which they devour in the &s;ame manner.&mdash;We placed this animal on the lowe&s;t &s;ail of the fore-ma&s;t&punc; It &s;pent two hours in climbing to the &s;cuttle, which a monkey would have accompli&s;hed in half a minute. One would imagine that it moves by a &s;pring, like the pendulum of a clock; <HI>Travels by Woods Rogers.</HI></NOTE>; and, du|ring
this &s;low and melancholy exerci&s;e, which
&s;ometimes la&s;ts &s;everal days, they are obliged to
&s;uffer the mo&s;t pre&s;&s;ing hunger. When arrived
<PB N="158" REF="178">
upon a tree, they never de&s;cend. They cling to
the branches, and devour &s;ucce&s;&s;ively the leaves
of every twig. They pa&s;s &s;everal weeks in this
&s;ituation, without receiving any drink. When
they have rendered the tree entirely naked, they
&s;till remain; becau&s;e they cannot de&s;cend. In
fine, when the pre&s;&s;ure of hunger becomes &s;upe|rior
to the dread of danger or death, being un|able
to de&s;cend, they allow them&s;elves to tumble
down like an inanimated ma&s;s; for their &s;tiff and
inactive limbs have not time to extend them|&s;elves
in order to break the fall.</P>
<P>When on the ground, they are at the mercy
of all their enemies. As their fle&s;h is not ab&s;o|lutely
bad, both men and rapacious animals go
in que&s;t of the&s;e animals. It appears that they
do not multiply fa&s;t, or, at lea&s;t, if they produce
frequently, it mu&s;t be in &s;mall numbers at a time;
for they have only two paps. Every circum|&s;tance,
therefore, concurs to de&s;troy them; and
it is extremely difficult for the &s;pecies to &s;upport
it&s;elf. But, though &s;low, awkward, and almo&s;t
incapable of motion, they are ob&s;tinate, &s;trong,
and tenacious of life. They can live very long
without victuals of any kind<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">I had a pre&s;ent of a living <HI>haut,</HI> which I kept twenty-&s;ix days, during which he neither eat nor drank; <HI>Singular. de la France Ant. par Thevet, p.</HI> 99.</NOTE>. They are co|vered
with thick, dry hair; and, being incapable
of exerci&s;e, they lo&s;e little by per&s;piration; and,
though their food be meager, they fatten by re|po&s;e.
<PB N="159" REF="179">
Though they have no horns nor hoofs,
nor cutting teeth in the under jaw, yet they be|long
to the ruminating tribes, and have &s;everal
&s;tomachs. Hence the quality of their food may
be compen&s;ated by the quantity they take at a
time. What is &s;till more &s;ingular, in&s;tead of
very long inte&s;tines, like other ruminating ani|mals,
their guts are very &s;hort and &s;mall, like
tho&s;e of the carnivorous kind. This contra&s;t ex|hibits
the ambiguity of Nature. The &s;loths are
unque&s;tionably ruminating animals: They have
four &s;tomachs; and yet they want every other
character, both internal and external, which ge|nerally
belongs to animals of this cla&s;s. There
is &s;till another &s;ingularity in the conformation of
the &s;loths: In&s;tead of three di&s;tinct apertures for
the di&s;charge of urine and excrements, and for
the purpo&s;es of generation, the&s;e animals have
but one, which terminates in a common canal, as
in birds.</P>
<P>Moreover, if the mi&s;ery re&s;ulting from a de|fect
of &s;entiment be not the wor&s;t of all, the pain
endured by the &s;loths, though very apparent,
&s;eems not to be real; for their &s;en&s;ations appear
to be blunt. Their calamitous air, their dull a|&s;pect,
and their reception of blows without emo|tion,
announce their extreme in&s;en&s;ibility. This
bluntne&s;s of &s;en&s;ation is farther demon&s;trated, by
their not dying in&s;tantly when their hearts and
bowels are entirely cut out. Pi&s;o, who made

facts, this quadruped &s;eems to approach not only
the turtle, but the other reptiles which have no
di&s;tinct centre of &s;en&s;ation. All the&s;e beings may
be &s;aid to be mi&s;erable, but not unhappy: Na|ture,
even in her mo&s;t neglected productions,

than of a &s;tepmother.</P>
<P>The&s;e two animals are peculiar to the &s;outhern
regions of the New Continent, and are no where
to be found in the Old. We formerly remark|ed,
that the editor of Seba's cabinet was decei|ved
when he calls the tow-toed &s;loth, or unau,
the <HI>&s;loth of Ceylon.</HI> This error, which has been
<PB N="161" REF="181">
adopted by Klein, Linnaeus, and Bri&s;&s;on, is now
more evident than it was formerly. The Marquis
de Montmirail has a live unau, which was tran&s;|mitted
to him from Surinam: Tho&s;e we have in
the Royal Cabinet were brought from the &s;ame
place and from Guiana; and I am per&s;uaded that
both &s;pecies exi&s;t through the whole de&s;erts of
America, from Bra&s;il<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">The a&iuml;, or three-toed &s;loth, de&s;cribed and engraven by Edwards, came from the Bay of Honduras; and Ulloa &s;ays, that it is found in the environs of Porto-bello.</NOTE> to Mexico. But, as they
have never frequented the northern regions, they
could not pa&s;s from the one Continent to the o|ther.
If the&s;e animals have &s;ometimes been &s;een
in the Ea&s;t Indies, or on the coa&s;t of Africa, it
is certain that they mu&s;t have been tran&s;ported
thither. They cannot endure cold; and they
likewi&s;e dread rain. The alternation of moi&s;ture
and dryne&s;s changes their fur, which has more
the appearance of ill dre&s;&s;ed hemp than of wool
or hair.</P>
<P>I &s;hall fini&s;h this article with &s;ome ob&s;ervations
communicated to me by the Marquis de Mont|mirail,
concerning an unau, or two-toed &s;loth,
which he fed three years in his menagerie: &startq;The
hair of the unau is much &s;ofter than that of
the a$.... All that has been &s;aid by travellers
concerning the exce&s;&s;ive &s;lowne&s;s of the &s;loths
&s;hould, probably, be applied only to the a&iuml;,
or three-toed &s;pecies. The unau, though very
heavy, and of an extremely awkward gait,
<PB N="162" REF="182">
mounted and de&s;cended the highe&s;t tree &s;everal
times in a day. It is in the evening and du|ring
the night that he was mo&s;t active, which
made me &s;u&s;pect that he &s;aw very ill in the day,
and that his eyes were of no u&s;e to him but in
the dark. I purcha&s;ed this animal at Am&s;ter|dam.
It was fed with &s;ea bi&s;cuit; and I was
told, that, during the verdure of the trees, it
would require nothing but leaves. We gave
him leaves, which he eat freely, when they
were tender; but, as &s;oon as they began to dry,
or were pierced by caterpillars, he refu&s;ed them.
During the three years that I kept him alive in
my menagerie, his ordinary food was bread,
apples, and roots; and his drink was milk.
He always laid hold, though with difficulty, of
what he wanted to eat, with his fore paws; and
the difficulty increa&s;ed in proportion to the
largene&s;s of the mor&s;el. He &s;eldom cried;
his cry is &s;hort, and he never repeats it twice,
without a con&s;iderable interval. This cry,
though plaintive, has no re&s;emblance to that of
the a&iuml;, if it be true that <HI>a&iuml;</HI> is the &s;ound of that
animal's voice. The mo&s;t natural &s;ituation of
the unau, and which he prefers to all others,
is hanging on a branch, with his body turned
downward. He &s;ometimes &s;leeps in this po|&s;ition,
his fore paws being fixed to the &s;ame
point, and his body forming an arch. The
&s;trength of his mu&s;cles is incredible; but it be|comes
u&s;ele&s;s to him when he walks; for his
<PB N="163" REF="183">
motion is con&s;trained and wavering. This
&s;tructure alone &s;eems to be the cau&s;e of the ani|mal's
&s;lowne&s;s, which, be&s;ides, has no violent
appetites, and does not recogni&s;e tho&s;e who
take care of him.&endq;</P>

<P>M. de la Borde remarks, that there are two
&s;pecies of the&s;e animals in Cayenne, the one
called the <HI>ba&s;hful &s;loth,</HI> and the other the <HI>&s;heep-&s;loth.</HI>
The latter is twice as long as the former,
and of the &s;ame thickne&s;s. He has long, bu&s;hy,
whiti&s;h hair, and weighs about twenty-five
pounds. He throws him&s;elf down upon men
from the tops of trees, but in a manner &s;o &s;lug|gi&s;h,
that it is ea&s;y to avoid him. He feeds du|ring
the day as well as the night.</P>
<P>&startq;The ba&s;hful &s;loth,&endq; M. de la Borde remarks,
&startq;has black &s;pots on his body, weighs twelve
pounds, keeps always on trees, and eats the
leaves of the Surinam fig-tree, which are &s;aid
to be poi&s;onous. The bowels of this &s;loth
poi&s;on dogs, and yet the fle&s;h is good eating;
but its u&s;e is confined to the common people.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Both &s;pecies produce only a &s;ingle young,
which they always carry on their back. It is
<PB N="164" REF="184">
probable, though I am not certain, that the fe|males
bring forth on trees. They feed on the
leaves of the Bra&s;ilian plumb-tree<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Spondias lutea of Linnaeus.</NOTE>, and of
the Surinam fig. The two &s;pecies are equally
common; but they are not frequent in the en|virons
of Cayenne. They &s;ometimes &s;u&s;pend
them&s;elves by their claws on branches of trees
which hang over the rivers; and, when in this
&s;ituation, it is ea&s;y to cut the branch and make
them fall into the water; for they never quit
their hold.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;When a&s;cending a tree, this animal carele&s;sly
&s;tretches out one of its fore pats, and fixes its
long claw as high as it can reach. It then
heavily rai&s;es its body, gradually fixes the o|ther
pat; and, in this manner, continues to
climb. All the&s;e movements are incredibly
&s;low and languid. When kept in hou&s;es, they
always climb upon &s;ome po&s;t or door, and ne|ver

M. de Seve, who has drawn, with equal
&s;kill and attention, the animals publi&s;hed in this
work, having kept it alive during &s;everal months,
communicated to me the remarks he had made
with regard to its natural habits and di&s;po&s;itions.
It is a hand&s;ome, active, and dexterous animal,
&s;ometimes walking on end, and frequently &s;it|ting
<PB N="167" REF="190">
upright, with his fore feet hanging down,
his head erect, and moving on the neck as up|on
a pivot. He always a&s;&s;umed this attitude
when he came near the fire to warm him&s;elf.
He is not &s;o large as a rabbit, and pretty much
re&s;embles the ichneumon, both in &s;ize and hair,
only it is rougher, and the tail is not &s;o long.
But, by the prominency of the upper part of
the muzzle, he makes a nearer approach to the
coati, or Bra&s;ilian Wea&s;el, than to any other a|nimal.
He has al&s;o a character which is pecu|liar
to him and the hyaena; for they are the
only animals which have four toes on all their
feet.</P>
<P>At fir&s;t, we fed this &s;urikate with milk, be|cau&s;e
he was very young: But his ta&s;te for
fle&s;h &s;oon appeared. He eat raw meat, and par|t&iuml;cularly
the fle&s;h of chickens, with great avidi|ty.
He likewi&s;e endeavoured to &s;eize young a|nimals.
A young rabbit, which lived in the
&s;ame hou&s;e, would have fallen a prey to him,
if he had not been prevented from making the
attack. He was fond of fi&s;h, and &s;till fonder
of eggs. I have &s;een him carry off, with his
two paws, eggs which had been put into the wa|ter
to be boiled. He refu&s;ed fruits, and even
bread, unle&s;s it was ma&s;hed. Like the &s;quirrel,
he employed his fore paws to convey his vic|tuals
to his mouth. In drinking, he lapped like
a dog, and never drank water but when it was
warm. His ordinary drink was his own urine,
<PB N="168" REF="191">
though it had a very &s;trong odour. He fro|licked
with the cats, and always innocently.
He did no harm to the children, and never bit
any per&s;on but the ma&s;ter of the hou&s;e, to whom
he had taken an aver&s;ion. He never gnawed
with his teeth, but often injured the pla&s;ter and
furniture by &s;cratching with his claws. He was
&s;o well tamed, that he knew his own name.
He went about through the whole hou&s;e, and
returned whenever he was called. He uttered
two kinds of &s;ounds. When he was tired by
being alone, or heard any unu&s;ual noi&s;e, he bark|ed
like a young dog; and, when he was care&s;|&s;ed,
or felt any plea&s;ant emotion, he made a noi&s;e
as bri&s;k and &s;triking as a &s;mall rattle rapidly
turned round. This animal was a female, and
appeared to be frequently in &s;ea&s;on, notwith|&s;tanding
the coldne&s;s of the climate, which,
though every thing was done to cheri&s;h and
keep her warm, &s;he could &s;upport during one
winter only.</P>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>SUPPLEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>We formerly remarked, that the &s;urikate did
no injury to children; and that it never bit any
per&s;on but adults, and, among others, the ma&s;ter
of the family, again&s;t whom it had taken an a|ver&s;ion.
I &s;ince learned that it never attacked
<PB N="169" REF="192">
either the mother or the children of his family,
but that it bit a number of other per&s;ons of both
&s;exes. M. de S&egrave;ve remarked, that it was indu|ced
to bite by &s;ome particular odour. When
laid hold of, the cartilage at the end of its no&s;e
curled up while it &s;melled, and, according to the
odour received, it either bit or did not bite. This
experiment was tried upon a number of people;
and, it is &s;ingular, whenever it bit one per&s;on,
it always continued to bite him. Some people
were &s;o di&s;agreeable to him, that he endeavour|ed
to make his e&s;cape in order to bite them;
and, when he could not lay hold of the legs, he
darted upon their &s;hoes or pettycoats. He e|ven
u&s;ed &s;everal artifices to come near tho&s;e
whom he wi&s;hed to bite.</P>
<P>M. Vo&s;ma&euml;r, in his de&s;cription of a flying
&s;quirrel, makes the following pertinent remarks.</P>
<P>&startq;M. de Buffon,&endq; &s;ays M. Vo&s;ma&euml;r, &startq;has pro|bably
been deceived both with regard to the
name and the native country of the &s;urikate,
which was la&s;t &s;ummer tran&s;mitted by M. Tul|bagh
to the Prince of Orange. It belongs not
to America, but to Africa. This &s;mall animal,
a male and a female of which were directed to
me, but the female died in the pa&s;&s;age, was
unknown to Kolbe, or at lea&s;t is not mention|ed
by him, appears to be found far up the
country only: This inference may be drawn
from the governour's letter, which I received
at the &s;ame time, and where he makes the fol|lowing
<PB N="170" REF="193">
remark: <HI>I &s;end by the Captain two
&s;mall animals, a male and a female, to which
I can neither give a name, nor refer them to a|ny
other &s;pecies; becau&s;e they were, for the
fir&s;t time, brought from the remote de&s;erts and
&s;tony mountains of this va&s;t country. They are
very mild and gentle. They feed upon fre&s;h
meat, either boiled or raw, eggs, and ants. I
hope they will arrive in life; for, I imagine, they
were never hitherto &s;een in Europe.</HI>&endq;</P>
<P>The evidence of M. Tulbagh is po&s;itive, and
M. de Vo&s;ma&euml;r's remark is ju&s;t; for, though I
had this animal alive for a long time, I received
its name and country from no better authority
than an animal merchant, who told me he had
purcha&s;ed it in Holland under the name of <HI>&s;uri|kate,</HI>
and that it came from Surinam. We are
now certain that it is neither found in Surinam
nor in the other provinces of South America,
but in the mountains of Africa above the Cape
of Good Hope; and, as to the name, it is of
little moment: It can be changed when we re|ceive
better information.</P>

<P>WE accidentally procured this animal from
a per&s;on who could neither tell its name,
nor from whence it came. It is remarkable for
the exce&s;&s;ive length of its hind legs. The bones
of the feet, and particularly tho&s;e which com|po&s;e
the upper part of the <HI>tar&s;us,</HI> are prodigi|ou&s;ly
long; and it is from this di&s;tinctive cha|racter
that we have derived the name of the
animal. The tar&s;ier, however, is not the only
quadruped who&s;e hind legs are con&s;tructed in this
manner. The tar&s;us of the Egyptian Jerboa
is &s;till longer. Hence the appellation of <HI>tar&s;ier</HI>
is only precarious, and ought to be changed as
&s;oon as we learn the name which the animal re|ceives
in the country where it is produced. The
Jerboa is found in Egypt, Barbary, and the Ea&s;t
<PB N="172" REF="196">
Indies. I at fir&s;t imagined that the tar&s;ier might
belong to the &s;ame countries, on account of its
re&s;emblance to the jerboa. Both the&s;e animals
are of the &s;ize of a middling rat. The hind legs
of both are exce&s;&s;ively long, and tho&s;e before
very &s;hort. In both, the tail is of a prodigious
length, and garni&s;hed toward the extremity with
long hairs. Both have very large eyes, and erect,
large, open ears. In both, the inferior part of
the hind legs are naked, while the re&s;t of the
body is covered with hair. As the&s;e animals
po&s;&s;e&s;s, in common, &s;uch peculiar characters, it
might be pre&s;umed that they were neighbour|ing
&s;pecies, or, at lea&s;t, &s;pecies produced by the
&s;ame climate and country. From a compari&s;on
of their other parts, however, this is rendered
extremely doubtful. The tar&s;ier has five toes
on all his feet, and may be &s;aid to have four
hands; for his five toes are very long, and well
&s;eparated. The thumbs of the hind feet termi|nate
in a flat nail; and, though the nails of the
other toes be pointed, they are &s;o &s;hort and
&s;mall, that the animal can u&s;e its fore feet in
the &s;ame manner as hands. The jerboa, on the
contrary, has only four toes, and four long
crooked claws on the fore feet; and, in&s;tead of
a thumb, it has only a tubercle without any nail.
But, what removes the&s;e animals to a greater
di&s;tance, the jerboa has but three toes, or three
large claws, on the hind feet. This di&s;tinction
is too great for animals nearly allied in &s;pecies;

and it is not impo&s;&s;ible that they belong to very
di&s;tant climates; for the tar&s;ier, by his &s;mall
&s;ize, his four hands, long toes, and &s;mall claws,
and his long tail and feet, &s;eems to make a near

all the other authors put together. He di&s;|&s;ected
the ham&s;ter, and gave a de&s;cription of
it, which corre&s;ponds almo&s;t in every article
<PB N="182" REF="210">
with ours; yet he is hardly quoted by our more
modern naturali&s;ts, who content them&s;elves with
copying Ge&s;ner. In ju&s;tice to this author, we
have in&s;erted his remarks entire; and, when
to the&s;e we add the ob&s;ervations of M. de Waitz,
the hi&s;tory of this animal will be complete.</P>
<P>&startq;The habitations of the ham&s;ter are different|ly
con&s;tructed, according to their &s;ex, age,
and the quality of the ground. The hou&s;e
of the male has an oblique pa&s;&s;age, at the
mouth of which there is a con&s;iderable heap
of earth. At a di&s;tance from this oblique
pa&s;&s;age, there is a hole which de&s;cends perpen|dicularly
<PB N="183" REF="211">
into the chambers of the lodging.
No earth appears near this hole; which ren|ders
it probable that the oblique pa&s;&s;age is dug
from without, and that the perpendicular hole
is begun from below, and continued upward.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;The hou&s;e of the female has likewi&s;e an ob|lique
pa&s;&s;age, and, at the &s;ame time, two,
three, and not unfrequently eight perpendicu|lar
holes, in order to allow her young to go out
and in at plea&s;ure. The male and female have
each a different dwelling, and the female
makes her's deeper than the male.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;At the di&s;tance of a foot or two on each
&s;ide of the perpendicular holes, the ham&s;ters
of both &s;exes, according to their age, and their
number of young, dig one, two, three, and
&s;ometimes four cavities in the form of vaults,
both above and below, which are more or le&s;s
capacious in proportion to the quantity of
their provi&s;ions.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;The perpendicular hole is the common pa&s;|&s;age:
The oblique one is made for the pur|po&s;e
of carrying out the earth. As the decli|vity
of this oblique pa&s;&s;age is more gentle in
one cavity than in another, it may likewi&s;e pro|mote
a circulation of air in tho&s;e &s;ubterrane|ous
habitations. In the cavern where the female
brings forth her young, there is no magazine
of grain, but a ne&s;t of &s;traw and herbs. The
depth of the caverns is various: A young
ham&s;ter, in the fir&s;t year, makes his cavern not
<PB N="184" REF="212">
above a foot deep; but the old ones frequent|ly
dig to the depth of four or five feet. The
whole habitation, including the pa&s;&s;ages and
caverns, is &s;ometimes from eight to ten feet
in diameter.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;The&s;e animals provide their magazines with
dry clean grain, corn in the ear, peas and
beans in their pods, and afterwards carry out
the hu&s;ks and pods by the oblique pa&s;&s;ages.
In tran&s;porting their provi&s;ions, they u&s;e the
pouches in their cheeks, each of which will
hold a quarter of an Engli&s;h pint.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;The ham&s;ter begins to lay up provi&s;ions a|bout
the end of Augu&s;t. When his magazines
are filled, he covers them, and carefully &s;huts
up all the avenues with earth, which prevents
his retreat from being ea&s;ily di&s;covered, and
it is only to be recogni&s;ed by the heap of
earth near the oblique pa&s;&s;age mentioned a|bove;
after which, the perpendicular holes
mu&s;t be inve&s;tigated. The mo&s;t common me|thod
of &s;eizing the&s;e animals is to dig them
out, which is a laborious ta&s;k, on account of
the extent and depth of their holes. A per|&s;on,
however, who accu&s;toms him&s;elf to this
&s;pecies of hunting, fails not to profit by it;
for, in autumn, which is the proper &s;ea&s;on, he
generally finds in each habitation, be&s;ide the
fur of the animal, two bu&s;hels of good grain.
The ham&s;ters produce twice or thrice in a year,
and bring forth five or &s;ix, and often more,
<PB N="185" REF="213">
at each litter. In &s;ome years they appear in
prodigious numbers, and, in others, hardly
any of them are to be &s;een. It is in moi&s;t
years that they multiply &s;o greatly; and this
numerous multiplication occa&s;ions a dearth, by
the general deva&s;tation they make among the
corn.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;At the age of &s;ix weeks or two months,
the ham&s;ters begin to dig their habitations;
but they neither couple nor produce during
the fir&s;t year.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;The polecats de&s;troy great numbers of the
ham&s;ters, and take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their holes.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;The ham&s;ters are commonly brown on the
back and white on the belly. Some of them,
however, are gray; and this difference may
be the effect of advanced age. Some of them
are al&s;o totally black.&endq;</P>
<P>Like the mulet, or long-tailed field mou&s;e,
the ham&s;ters mutually de&s;troy each other. Of
two kept in a cage, the female killed the male
in one night, and, after cutting the mu&s;cles
which fix the jaws to each other, devoured
a part of the inte&s;tines. They produce &s;everal
times in the year, and are &s;o de&s;tructive, that,
in the &s;tates of Germany, a price is &s;et upon
their heads. They are &s;o numerous in that part
of the Continent, that their fur is a con&s;iderable
article of commerce.</P>
<P>All the&s;e facts, which we have extracted
from the memoir of M. Waitz, and the remarks
<PB N="186" REF="214">
of M. de Montmirail, appear to be certain, and
corre&s;pond with our other &s;ources of informa|tion
concerning the ham&s;ters. But it is not e|qually
certain, as mentioned in the &s;ame me|moir,
that they remain in a torpid &s;tate du|ring
the winter, and revive in the &s;pring. The
ham&s;ter which we kept la&s;t winter (1762&ndash;3) in
an apartment without fire, and where the
cold frequently congealed water, never became
torpid, but moved about and eat its ordinary
food. But &s;everal kinds of dormice, which
were likewi&s;e in our po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, became torpid
in a much &s;maller degree of cold. Hence the
ham&s;ter neither approaches the dormice nor
marmot by this character; and &s;ome of our na|turali&s;ts
have improperly called it the <HI>marmot of
Stra&s;burg,</HI> though it &s;leeps not like the mar|mot,
nor is found in the neighbourhood of Stra&s;|burg.</P>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>SUPPLEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>In the <HI>Gazette de Litt&eacute;rature,</HI> of the 13th of
September 1774, we find the following ob&s;erva|tions
concerning the ham&s;ter, extracted from a
German publication by M. Sulzer.</P>
<P>&startq;The corn-rat, in German <HI>ham&s;ter,</HI> cannot be
more commodiou&s;ly de&s;cribed than at Gotha,
where, in one year, 11574 &s;kins of it, in ano|ther,
<PB N="187" REF="215">
54429, and, in a third, 80139, have been
brought to the town-hou&s;e. In general, this
animal inhabits temperate countries. When
irritated, its heart beats 180 times in a minute.
The weight of the body is to that of the brain
as 1 to 193.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;The&s;e animals lay up magazines which of|ten
con&s;i&s;t of twelve pounds of grain. In
winter, the female &s;inks very deep in the earth.
The male is a bold animal, and defends him|&s;elf
again&s;t dogs, cats, and men. He is natu|rally
quarrel&s;ome, agrees not with his own
&s;pecies, and &s;ometimes, in a tran&s;port of fury,
&s;lays his own family. He devours the feeble
individuals of his &s;pecies, as well as mice and
birds; and yet he feeds upon all kinds of
herbs, fruits, and &s;eeds. He drinks little; and
the female remains longer in her winter re|treat
than the male. The former goes four
weeks with young, and often produces &s;ix at
a litter. In a few months, the females be|come
fertile. The rat called <HI>Iltis</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">The <HI>Iltis</HI> is the polecat, and not a rat, as this author alledges.</NOTE> kills the
ham&s;ter.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;When this animal is in a torpid &s;tate, nei|ther
re&s;piration, nor any kind of feeling, can
be perceived. The heart, however, beats fif|teen
times in a minute, which is di&s;covered by
opening the che&s;t. The blood continues to be
fluid, and the inte&s;tines are not irritable. Even
<PB N="188" REF="216">
an electrical &s;hock does not awake him: In
the open air, he is never reduced to a torpid
&s;tate.&endq;</P>
<P>M. Sulzer mentions the gradual manner in
which this animal recovers his vigour and ac|tivity.</P>
<P>&startq;The utility of the ham&s;ter is confined to the
de&s;truction of mice; but he him&s;elf is much
more mi&s;chievous<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ob&s;ervat. &s;ur le rat de bl&eacute;, par M. Sulzer; <HI>Gazette de Litt&eacute;rature, 13 Sept.</HI> 1774.</NOTE>.&endq;</P>
<P>We wi&s;h that M. Sulzer had marked the pre|ci&s;e
degree of cold, or want of air, which renders
the&s;e animals torpid; for we &s;till maintain, what
was formerly remarked, that a ham&s;ter confined
in a cage, and in a room where water froze, was
not reduced to a torpid &s;tate during the winter
1763. This fact will receive additional confir|mation
from the following ob&s;ervations of M.
Allamand, which he has publi&s;hed at the end of
the Dutch edition of my work.</P>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>Addition to the hi&s;tory of the HAMSTER, by
M. ALLAMAND.</HEAD>
<P>The ham&s;ter is a quadruped of the mou&s;e
kind, which &s;leeps during the winter, like the
marmots. The legs and neck are &s;hort; the
head is thicki&s;h; and the mouth is garni&s;hed
<PB N="189" REF="217">
on each &s;ide with whi&s;kers. The ears are large
and almo&s;t naked. The tail is &s;hort, and one
half of it naked. The eyes are round and pro|minent.
The colour of the hair is a mixture of
red, yellow, white, and black. The&s;e characters
exhibit not the mo&s;t alluring picture; and the
manners of the animal are &s;till more di&s;gu&s;ting.
He has no love but for him&s;elf, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es not
a &s;ingle &s;ocial quality. He attacks and devours
every animal he is capable of conquering, not
excepting his own &s;pecies. Even the in&s;tinct
which draws him to the other &s;ex, la&s;ts only a
few hours; at the end of which the female would
not meet with a better fate, if &s;he did not
take the precaution of avoiding, or of killing
him fir&s;t. To the&s;e odious qualities, however,
Nature has joined others, which, without ren|dering
him more amiable, make him de&s;erve a
di&s;tingui&s;hed rank in the hi&s;tory of animals.
He belongs to the &s;mall number of tho&s;e which
pa&s;s the winter in a torpid &s;tate, and he is the
only European animal that is provided with
cheek-pouches. His addre&s;s in making a &s;ub|terraneous
abode, and the indu&s;try with which
he lays up provi&s;ions, merit the attention of the
curious.</P>
<P>The ham&s;ter inhabits not all &s;oils or climates
indifferently. He is neither found in very warm
nor in very cold countries. As he lives upon
grains, and dwells under the earth, &s;tony, &s;andy,
or argillaceous &s;oils, are as inconvenient to him
<PB N="190" REF="218">
as meadows, fore&s;ts, and mar&s;hy grounds. He
requires a &s;oil which is ea&s;ily pierced, and yet
&s;o tenacious as not to tumble down. He like|wi&s;e
choo&s;es countries which abound in all kinds
of grain, that he may not be obliged to &s;eek his
food at great di&s;tances, for which he is not well
qualified. In Thuringia, the &s;oil of which po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;es
all the&s;e qualities, the ham&s;ters are more
numerous than in any other country.</P>
<P>The habitation, which the ham&s;ter digs to the
depth of three or four feet, con&s;i&s;ts of more or
fewer apartments, according to the age of the
animal. The principal chamber is lined with
&s;traw, and &s;erves him for a lodging. The others
are de&s;tined for the pre&s;ervation of provi&s;ions,
of which he ama&s;&s;es great quantities during the
autumn. Each hole has two apertures; the
one de&s;cends obliquely, and the other, through
which the animal goes out and in, is perpendi|cular.</P>
<P>The holes of the females, who never live with
the males, are &s;omewhat different. In tho&s;e
where &s;he brings forth, there is &s;eldom above
one chamber for provi&s;ions; becau&s;e the &s;hort
time the young remain with her requires not a
great &s;tore of food. But, in&s;tead of one perpen|dicular
hole, &s;he makes &s;even or eight, to give
free pa&s;&s;age to her young. Sometimes the mo|ther
bani&s;hes her offspring, and continues to po&s;|&s;e&s;s
this hole; but &s;he commonly digs another,
<PB N="191" REF="219">
and lays up as much provi&s;ions as the &s;ea&s;on per|mits
her to collect.</P>
<P>The ham&s;ters copulate about the end of April,
when the males enter the apartments of the fe|males,
where they remain only a few days. If
two males happen to meet in the &s;ame hole, a
furious combat en&s;ues, which generally termi|nates
in the death of the weake&s;t. The con|queror
takes po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the female, and both,
though at every other period they per&s;ecute and
kill each other, lay a&s;ide their natural ferocity
during the few days their amours continue. They
even mutually defend each other again&s;t aggre&s;|&s;ors.
When a hole is opened at this period, and
the female perceives that her hu&s;band is about
to be carried off, &s;he darts upon the ravi&s;her,
and makes him feel the fury of her vengeance,
by inflicting deep and painful wounds.</P>
<P>The females bring forth twice or thrice every
year. Their litter is never fewer than &s;ix, and
oftener from &s;ixteen to eighteen. The growth
of the&s;e animals is very rapid. At the age of
fifteen days, they already begin to dig the earth.
Soon after, the mother bani&s;hes them from her
habitation: So that, at the age of about three
weeks, they are abandoned to their own ma|nagement.
The mother, in general, di&s;covers
little tenderne&s;s for her off&s;pring. She who, in
the &s;ea&s;on of love, defends her hu&s;band with
courage, flies in the mo&s;t da&s;tardly manner when
her family is threatened with danger. Her
<PB N="192" REF="220">
only &s;olicitude is to provide for her own &s;afety.
With this view, when pur&s;ued, &s;he digs deeper
into the earth, which &s;he performs with an a|mazing
quickne&s;s. The young would willing|ly
follow her; but &s;he is deaf to their cries, and
even &s;huts the hole which &s;he had made.</P>
<P>The ham&s;ter feeds upon all kinds of herbs,
roots, and grains, which the different &s;ea&s;ons
produce. He even eats the fle&s;h of &s;uch ani|mals
as he can conquer. As he is not adapted
for long journies, his magazine is fir&s;t &s;tocked
with the provi&s;ions which are neare&s;t his abode.
This is the rea&s;on why &s;ome of his chambers are
frequently filled with one kind of grain only.
When the harve&s;t is reaped, he goes to a great|er
di&s;tance in que&s;t of provi&s;ions, and carries
every article he can find, without di&s;tinction, to
his granary. To facilitate the tran&s;portation of
his food, Nature has furni&s;hed him with two
pouches in the in&s;ide of each cheek. On the
out&s;ide, the&s;e pouches are membranous, &s;mooth,
and &s;hining; and, in the in&s;ide, there are a great
many glands, which continually &s;ecrete a certain
fluid, to pre&s;erve their flexibility, and to enable
them to re&s;i&s;t any accidents which may be occa|&s;ioned
by the roughne&s;s or &s;harpne&s;s of particu|lar
grains. Each of the&s;e cheeks is capable of
containing an ounce and a half of grain, which,
on his return to his habitation, he empties, by
pre&s;&s;ing his two fore feet again&s;t his cheeks.
When we meet a ham&s;ter having his cheeks filled
<PB N="193" REF="221">
with provi&s;ions, it is ea&s;y to &s;eize him with the
hand, without the ri&s;k of being bitten; becau&s;e, in
this condition, he has not the free motion of his
jaws. But, if he is allowed a little time, he &s;oon
empties his pouches, and &s;tands upon his de|fence.
The quantity of provi&s;ions found in the
holes depends on the age and &s;ex of the inha|bitant.
The old ham&s;ters often ama&s;s a hundred
pounds of grain; but the young and the females
content them&s;elves with a quantity much &s;maller.
Their object in laying up provi&s;ions is not to
nouri&s;h them during the winter, which they pa&s;s
in &s;leep and without eating, but to &s;upport them
after they awake in the &s;pring, and previous to
their falling into a torpid &s;tate.</P>
<P>At the approach of winter, the ham&s;ters re|tire
into their &s;ubterraneous abodes; the entry
to which they &s;hut up with great addre&s;s. There
they remain in perfect tranquillity, and feed on
their provi&s;ions, till the fro&s;t becomes &s;evere,
when they &s;ink into a torpid &s;tate, which re&s;em|bles
a profound &s;leep. When, during this pe|riod,
the holes are opened, which we know by
a &s;mall eminence of earth rai&s;ed near the oblique
pa&s;&s;age formerly de&s;cribed, we find the ham&s;ter
lying upon a bed of &s;oft &s;traw. His head is
bended under his belly, between the two fore
legs, and tho&s;e behind re&s;t upon his muzzle.
The eyes are &s;hut; and, when the eye-lids are
forced open, they in&s;tantly clo&s;e again. The
members are &s;tiff, like tho&s;e of a dead animal,
<PB N="194" REF="222">
and the whole body feels as cold as ice. Nei|ther
re&s;piration nor any other &s;ign of life can be
perceived. When di&s;&s;ected in this &s;ituation, we
&s;ee the heart alternately contracting and dilating.
But this movement is &s;o &s;low, that the pul&s;ations
exceed not fifteen in a minute; though, when
the animal is awake, the heart beats a hundred
and fifty &s;trokes during the &s;ame time. The fat
has the appearance of being coagulated. The
inte&s;tines are as cold as the external parts of the
body, and di&s;cover not the &s;malle&s;t irritability
upon the application of &s;pirit of wine or oil of
vitriol. During this operation, the animal &s;eems
to feel very little. He &s;ometimes opens his
mouth, as if he wanted to re&s;pire. But his le|thargy
is too &s;trong to admit of his wakening
entirely.</P>
<P>The lethargy of the ham&s;ter has been a&s;cribed
&s;olely to a certain degree of cold: This may be
true with regard to the dormice and bats. But
experience proves, that, in order to render the
ham&s;ter torpid, he mu&s;t al&s;o be excluded from
all communication with the external air: For,
when a ham&s;ter is &s;hut up in a cage filled with
earth and &s;traw, and expo&s;ed in winter to a de|gree
of cold &s;ufficient to freeze water, he never
becomes torpid. But, when the cage is &s;unk
four or five feet under ground, and well &s;ecured
again&s;t the acce&s;s of air, at the end of eight or
ten days he is equally torpid as if he had been
in his own burrow. If the cage is brought up
<PB N="195" REF="223">
to the &s;urface, the ham&s;ter will awake in a few
hours, and re&s;ume his torpid &s;tate when put be|low
the earth. This experiment may be repeat|ed
with the &s;ame &s;ucce&s;s, as long as the fro&s;t
continues. We have a farther proof that the
ab&s;ence of the air is one of the cau&s;es of torpid|ne&s;s
in the ham&s;ter: When brought up from his
hole, in the colde&s;t weather, and expo&s;ed to the
air, he infallibly awakes in a few hours. This
experiment &s;ucceeds equally either in the night
or day, which proves that the light forms no
part of the cau&s;e.</P>
<P>It is curious to ob&s;erve the ham&s;ter pa&s;&s;ing
from a torpid to an active &s;tate. He fir&s;t lo&s;es
the rigidity of his members, and then makes a
profound re&s;piration, but at long intervals. His
legs begin to move, he opens his mouth, and
utters di&s;agreeable and rattling &s;ounds. After
continuing the&s;e operations for &s;ome time, he o|pens
his eyes, and endeavours to rai&s;e him&s;elf
on his legs. But all the&s;e movements are &s;till
reeling and un&s;teady, like tho&s;e of a man intox|icated
with liquor. He, however, reiterates his
efforts, till he is enabled to &s;tand on his legs. In
this attitude he remains fixed, as if he meant
to reconnoitre, and repo&s;e him&s;elf after his fa|tigues.
But he gradually begins to walk, to eat,
and to act in his u&s;ual manner. This pa&s;&s;age
from a torpid to an active &s;tate, requires more or
le&s;s time, according to the temperature of the
air. When expo&s;ed to a cold air, he &s;ometimes
<PB N="196" REF="224">
requires more than two hours to awake, and, in
a more temperate air, he accompli&s;hes his pur|po&s;e
in le&s;s than one hour. It is probable that
this change is produced imperceptibly, when the
animal is in his hole, and that he feels none of
the inconveniencies which ari&s;e from a &s;udden
and forced revivi&s;cence.</P>
<P>The life of a ham&s;ter is divided between the
nece&s;&s;ary cares of &s;atisfying his natural appetites,
and the fury of combating. He &s;eems to have
no other pa&s;&s;ion but that of rage, which indu|ces
him to attack every animal that comes in his
way, without attending to the &s;uperior &s;trength
of the enemy. Ignorant of the art of &s;aving
him&s;elf by flight, rather than yield, he allows
him&s;elf to be beat to pieces with a &s;tick. If he
&s;eizes a man's hand, he mu&s;t be killed before he
quits his hold. The magnitude of the hor&s;e ter|rifies
him as little as the addre&s;s of the dog,
which la&s;t is fond of hunting him. When the
ham&s;ter perceives the dog at a di&s;tance, he be|gins
with emptying his cheek-pouches, if they
happen to be filled with grain. He then blows
them up &s;o prodigiou&s;ly, that the &s;ize of the
head and neck greatly exceeds that of the re&s;t of
the body. In fine, he rai&s;es him&s;elf on his hind
legs, and, in this attitude, darts upon the enemy.
If he catches hold, he never quits it but with
the lo&s;s of his life. But the dog generally &s;eizes
him behind, and &s;trangles him. This ferocious
temper prevents the ham&s;ter from being at peace
<PB REF="225">

<P>HAMSTER.</P>
</FIGURE>
<PB N="197" REF="226">
with any other animal. He even makes war
again&s;t his own &s;pecies, not excepting the fe|males.
When two ham&s;ters rencounter, they
never fail to attack each other, and the &s;tronger
always devours the weaker. A combat between
a male and a female commonly la&s;ts longer than
between two males. They begin by pur&s;uing
and biting each other; then each of them retire
to a &s;ide, as if to take breath; a little after, they
renew the combat, and continue to fly and to
fight till one of them falls. The vanqui&s;hed u|niformly
&s;erves for a repa&s;t to the conqueror.</P>

is not a marmot, as it is probable that the
bobak does belong to that &s;pecies; for the bobak
differs from the Alpine marmot only in the co|lour
of his hair, which, in&s;tead of brown, is a
pale yellow. He has al&s;o a thumb, or rather a
claw on the fore-feet; while the marmot has only
four toes and no thumb. In every other article,
the re&s;emblance is perfect; from which it is to
be pre&s;umed, that the&s;e two animals are not di|&s;tinct
&s;pecies. The &s;ame ob&s;ervation applies to
the <HI>monax,</HI> or <HI>marmot of Canada,</HI> which by &s;ome
travellers has been called the <HI>whi&s;tler.</HI> He
&s;eems to differ from the marmot only by the
tail, which is longer, and more bu&s;hy. Hence
the monax of Canada, the bobak of Poland, and
the Alpine marmot, appear to be the &s;ame ani|mal,
which, from the influence of different cli|mates,
<PB N="199" REF="228">
have undergone the varieties formerly men|tioned.
As this &s;pecies prefers the colde&s;t and
mo&s;t mountainous regions, and as it is found in
Poland, Ru&s;&s;ia, and other parts of the North of
Europe, it is not &s;urpri&s;ing that it &s;hould like|wi&s;e

Neither is this circum&s;tance peculiar to the mar|mot;
for all the animals common to both Con|tinents
are &s;maller in the New than in the Old
World.</P>
<P>The Siberian animal, which the Ru&s;&s;ians call
<HI>Jevra&s;chka,</HI> is a &s;pecies of marmot &s;till &s;maller
than the Canadian monax. It has a round head
and a blunt no&s;e. It has no external ears, and
the auditory pa&s;&s;ages can only be di&s;covered by
removing the hair. The length of the body,
including the head, exceeds not a foot; and the
tail, which is round near the body, then flat,
and truncated at the extremity, is but three
inches long. The body of this animal is pretty
thick, the hair is yellow, mixed with gray, and
that on the end of the tail is almo&s;t black. The
legs are &s;hort, tho&s;e before being &s;omewhat
longer than tho&s;e behind. The hind feet have
five toes and five black claws, which are a little
crooked; and the fore feet have only four.
When the&s;e animals are irritated, or attempted
<PB N="200" REF="229">
to be &s;eized, they bite violently, and &s;et up a
&s;harp cry like the marmot. When they eat,
they &s;it on their buttocks, and carry the victuals
to their mouths with the fore paws. They come
in &s;ea&s;on in &s;pring, and bring forth in &s;ummer.
The litter is generally five or &s;ix. They dig
holes in the earth, where they pa&s;s the winter,
and where the female brings forth and &s;uckles
her young. Though they have a great re&s;em|blance
to the marmot, yet they appear to be of
a different &s;pecies; for, in the &s;ame parts of Si|beria,

<HEAD>THE JERBOAS.</HEAD>
<P>JERBOA is a generic name employed to de|note
tho&s;e animals which are remarkable for
the di&s;proportion between the hind and fore legs,
the latter not exceeding the length of a mole's
paws, and the former re&s;embling the legs of a
bird. In this genus, we are acquainted with
four &s;pecies, or di&s;tinct varieties: 1. The Tar|&s;ier,

which is certainly a particular &s;pecies, becau&s;e it
has five toes on each foot, like tho&s;e of a mon|key.
2. The Jerboa, properly &s;o called<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot"><P>The Egyptian Jerboa, with thin, erect, and broad ears, full and dark eyes, and long whi&s;kers.

<P>From comparing the&s;e two de&s;criptions, the
fir&s;t of which is taken from Edwards and Ha&s;|&s;elqui&s;t,
and the &s;econd from Gmelin, it appears
that the jerboa and alagtaga re&s;emble each other
in a &s;triking manner. The jerboa is only &s;mal|ler
then the alagtaga, and has but four toes on
the fore feet, and three on the hind, without a|ny
&s;pur; while the alagtaga has five toes on the
fore feet, and three and a &s;pur on the hind feet.
But I &s;u&s;pect that this difference is not con&s;tant;
for Dr Shaw, who has given a figure and de|&s;cription
of a Barbary jerboa, repre&s;ents it with
<PB N="206" REF="236">
a &s;pur or fourth toe on the hind feet; and Mr
Edwards remarks, that he carefully examined
two jerboas which he &s;aw in England, and could
di&s;cover no &s;pur. Hence this character, which
might &s;erve as a &s;pecific di&s;tinction between the
jerboa and alagtaga, by not being con&s;tant, an|&s;wers
no purpo&s;e, but marks rather the identity
than the diver&s;ity of the &s;pecies. Neither does
the difference in &s;ize prove them to be di&s;tinct
&s;pecies: Edwards and Ha&s;&s;elqui&s;t may have de|&s;cribed
only young jerboas, and Gmelin an old
alagtaga.</P>
<P>Two circum&s;tances, however, render this
matter &s;till doubtful; the proportion of the tail,
which is much larger in the jerboa than in the
alagtaga, and the difference of the climates which
they inhabit. The jerboa is common in Circa&s;|&s;ia<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">In Circa&s;&s;ia, Per&s;ia, Arabia, and the environs of Babylon, there is a kind of field-mou&s;e, called <HI>jerbuach</HI> in the Arabic language, which is nearly of the &s;ize and colour of the &s;quir|rel.&mdash;When it leaps, it darts five or &s;ix feet above the ground.&mdash;It &s;ometimes quits the fields, and takes up its abode in the hou&s;es; <HI>Voyage d'Olearius, p.</HI> 177.</NOTE>,

It only appears, that, in Egypt, where the ich|neumons

The nomenclators, who perpetually blunder

But it is not &s;urpri&s;ing to find petulance and pedantry in the works of a &s;chool-boy.

In fine, becau&s;e the numerous relations, and precarious combinations, with which we are obliged to load the memory, render the labour of the reader greater than that of the author, and leave both as ignorant as they were before. What proves that, in rotes of this nature, neither reading nor knowledge are nece&s;&s;ary, is, 1. The fal&s;e imputation thrown on the French nation with regard to <HI>Pharaoh's rat;</HI> 2. The blunder he commits in a&s;cribing to this animal the Arabian name <HI>Nems,</HI> which &s;ignifies the ferret, and not the ichneumon. To avoid this error, an acquaintance with the Arabic language was unnece&s;&s;ary; it was enough to have read the travels of tho&s;e who had gone before him in the &s;ame country; 3. The omi&s;&s;ion of e&s;&s;ential characters, while he enlarges with|out mea&s;ure upon tho&s;e which are indifferent. He de&s;cribes, for example, the cameleopard as minutely as the ichneumon; but he omits the mo&s;t important character, namely, whether the horns are permanent, or fall off annually: Among a thou&s;and u&s;ele&s;s words, we find not the one which is mo&s;t ne|ce&s;&s;ary, and, from his de&s;cription, we cannot di&s;cover whether the cameleopard belongs to the &s;tag or ox kind.

&s;trong odour of mu&s;k. When the &s;kin was
&s;tuffed at the royal garden, I examined it at|tentively,
and could perceive no pouch or
&s;mell of mu&s;k. I reared a &s;imilar animal in
Cochinchina, and another in the Philippine
i&s;lands. Both of them were males, and they
<PB N="220" REF="251">
became a little familiar. They were very
young, and I kept them only two or three
months. I found no pouch in the part you
mentioned; and I only perceived that their
excrements had an odour &s;imilar to tho&s;e of
our martin. They eat fle&s;h and fruits; but
they preferred the latter, and &s;howed a deci|ded
ta&s;te for bananas, upon which they &s;prung
with avidity. This animal is very wild,
and difficult to tame. Though taken when
young, his air and character were always fe|rocious,
which &s;eemed to be uncommon in
an animal that feeds &s;pontaneou&s;ly on fruits.
The eye of the fo&s;&s;ane is a large black globe,
which gives it a mi&s;chievous a&s;pect.&endq;</P>

<P>The van&s;ire, as formerly remarked, is a native
of Madaga&s;car and the interior parts of Africa.
It has a great re&s;emblance to the ferret, except in
the number and form of the teeth, and in the tail&punc;
which is much longer in the van&s;ire than in our
ferret. We here give the figure of an animal
which was tran&s;mitted to us from the Ea&s;tern
part of Africa, under the denomination of <HI>Neip&s;e.</HI>
From its figure as well as its name, I know it to
be a &s;pecies of ferret; for <HI>nems</HI> or <HI>nims</HI> is the
name of the ferret in the Arabic language. The&s;e
Arabian ferrets, or <HI>nems,</HI> have a greater re&s;em|blance
to the van&s;ire than to our European ferrets.
M. de S&eacute;ve gives the following de&s;cription of the
<HI>nems.</HI></P>
<P>&startq;The <HI>nems,</HI> from his figure and flexibility, is
a genuine ferret. When he walks, he lengthens
his body, and appears to have very &s;hort legs.
The individual under con&s;ideration was a male,
and about thirteen inches and a half long from
the muzzle to the anus, and the length of the
tail one foot. The fore part of the body is
five inches and a half high, and the hind part
&s;ix inches and a half. The ears are naked,
and of the &s;ame figure with tho&s;e of the com|mon
ferret. The eye is vivacious, and the co|lour
<PB N="222" REF="255">
of the iris a deep yellow. The muzzle,
which is very &s;harp, appeared not to have any
whi&s;kers. The whole body is covered with
long hair, which is a mixture of dark brown
and a dirty white, and gives it a re&s;emblance
to the &s;ilvery rabbit. The hair on the belly is
of a bright yellow colour, without any mix|ture.
The ground colour on the head, and
round the eyes, is clear and yellowi&s;h: On the
no&s;e, cheeks, and other parts of the face where
the hair is &s;hort, a tincture of brown, more or
le&s;s deep, prevails without mixture, and gra|dually
lo&s;es it&s;elf above the eyes. The legs
are covered with &s;hort hair, of a deep yellow
colour. On the paws there are four toes, and
a &s;mall one behind. The claws are &s;mall and
black. The tail, which is more than double
the length of that of our ferrets, is very thick
at its origin, terminates in a point, and is co|vered
with hair &s;imilar to that on the body.
This animal, according to the information of
the boy who has the charge of it, never drinks.&endq;

are entirely black, and others entirely
white. The&s;e animals are all natives of the
Ea&s;tern regions of Africa, and particularly of
Madaga&s;car, where they are very numerous.</P>
<P>The Maucauco is a beautiful animal. His
a&s;pect is agreeable, his figure elegant, and his
hair always neat and glo&s;&s;y. He is remarkable
for the largene&s;s of his eyes, the height of his
hind legs, which are much longer than tho&s;e be|fore,
and his large and hand&s;ome tail, which is
always erected, always in motion, and garni&s;h|ed
with thirty alternate rings of black and white,
well marked and &s;eparated from each other. His
manners are gentle, and, though he has a great
re&s;emblance to the monkeys, he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es none
of their malicious di&s;po&s;itions. In a &s;tate of li|berty,
the maucauco's live in &s;ociety, and they
are found in Madaga&s;car in troops of thirty or
forty<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">The vari's, who&s;e tails are barred with black and white, go in troops of thirty, forty, or fifty: They re&s;emble the va|rico&s;&s;i's; <HI>Voyage de Flacourt, p.</HI> 154.</NOTE>. In a dome&s;tic &s;tate, the prodigious ra|pidity
of their movements renders them incom|modious:
It is for this rea&s;on alone that they
are generally chained; for, though extremely
<PB N="226" REF="263">
active and vivacious, they are neither mi&s;chie|vous
nor ferocious. They tame to &s;uch a de|gree
as to go out and return, without any dan|ger
of running off. Their gait is oblique, like
that of all animals which have hands in&s;tead of
feet. The maucauco leaps more gracefully than
he walks. He is a &s;ilent animal, uttering only
a &s;hort acute cry when &s;urpri&s;ed or irritated. He
&s;leeps in a &s;itting po&s;ture, with his muzzle re&s;t|ing
on his brea&s;t. His body is not thicker than
that of a cat, but it is longer; and the height of
his legs gives him the appearance of being larger
than he really is. His hair, though very &s;oft to
the touch, &s;tands always erect. In the male
maucauco, the organs of generation are &s;mall
and concealed; but tho&s;e of the mongous, or
woolly maucauco, are di&s;proportionally large, and
very apparent.</P>
<P>The mongous is &s;maller than the maucauco;
his hair is likewi&s;e &s;ilky, pretty &s;hort, and &s;ome|what
curled. His no&s;e is larger than that of the
maucauco, and re&s;embles that of the vari. I had
a mongous in my po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion for &s;everal years,
which was altogether brown. It had yellow
eyes, a black no&s;e, and &s;hort ears. It amu&s;ed
it&s;elf with eating its own tail, and actually de|&s;troyed
the la&s;t four or five vertebrae. This a|nimal
was extremely dirty, and &s;o trouble&s;ome
that we were obliged to chain him. Whenever
he could make his e&s;cape, he went into the
neighbouring &s;hops in que&s;t of fruits, &s;ugar, and
<PB N="227" REF="264">
&s;weetmeats, and opened the boxes which con|tained
them. It was difficult to &s;eize him, and
he bit cruelly even tho&s;e with whom he was be&s;t
acquainted. He uttered a low grunting noi&s;e,
almo&s;t perpetually; and, when tired of being
alone, he croaked like a frog, and &s;o loud as to
be heard at a great di&s;tance. This mongous
was a male, and his te&s;ticles were extremely large
in proportion to the &s;ize of his body. He was
fond of the &s;he-cats, and even &s;ati&s;fied his de&s;ires,
without any intimate union: His embraces
were, of cour&s;e, ineffectual. He dreaded cold
and moi&s;ture; he never departed from the fire,
and &s;tood on end to warm him&s;elf. He was fed
with bread and fruits. His tongue was rough,
like that of a cat; and, when permitted, he lick|ed
a per&s;on's hand till it was inflamed, and of|ten
fini&s;hed this operation with a &s;evere bite.
The cold of the winter 1750 killed him, though
he never quitted his &s;tation near the fire. His
movements were extremely bri&s;k, and &s;ometimes
petulant. He often &s;lept during the day; but
his &s;lumbers were &s;o light, that the &s;malle&s;t noi&s;e
awaked him.</P>
<P>In this &s;pecies there are &s;everal varieties, both
in colour and &s;ize: The mongous, who&s;e hi&s;to|ry
has ju&s;t now been given, was totally brown,
and about the &s;ize of an ordinary cat. I &s;aw
one, which, though an adult, was not larger than
the fat &s;quirrel. If this &s;mall mongous had not
perfectly re&s;embled the large kind, except in &s;ize,
<PB N="228" REF="265">
it would unque&s;tionably have been a di&s;tinct
&s;pecies. But, as we have no evidence that the&s;e
two animals do not intermix, we mu&s;t &s;till re|gard
them as the &s;ame &s;pecies, till we acquire
&s;ome new light as to their hi&s;tory and oecono|my.</P>
<P>The vari<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Flacourt, who calls the maucauco <HI>vari,</HI> gives the name of <HI>varico&s;&s;y</HI> to this animal; which epithet, probably, denotes the greater &s;ize and ferocity of the animal, who likewi&s;e differs from the maucauco in &s;everal other articles.</NOTE> is larger, &s;tronger, and more fero|cious

lion, and is tremendous to tho&s;e who hear it for
the fir&s;t time. This a&s;toni&s;hing &s;trength of
voice, in a middle &s;ized animal, depends on the
&s;ingular &s;tructure of its wind-pipe, the two
branches of which widen, and form a large cavi|ty,
before they enter the lungs. Hence he dif|fers
from the maucauco both in &s;tructure and
di&s;po&s;itions. His hair, in general, is longer; and
<PB N="229" REF="266">
he has a kind of a ruff or cravat of &s;till longer
hair, which &s;urrounds his neck, and forms a very
di&s;tinct character by which he is ea&s;ily known.
In colour, he varies from white to black, or pied;
and his hair, though long and very &s;oft, &s;tands
almo&s;t perpendicular to the &s;kin. His muzzle
is larger and proportionally longer than that of
the maucauco. His ears are much &s;horter, and
fringed with long hairs. His eyes are of &s;o
deep an orange colour, that they appear to be
red.</P>

to the monkeys; for, though they &s;ome|times

they are more frugivorous than carnivorous, and

<P>THE Loris is a &s;mall animal of Ceylon,
which is very remarkable for the elegance
of its figure, and the &s;ingularity of its conforma|tion.
Of all animals, its body is, perhaps, the
longe&s;t in proportion to its bulk. It has nine
lumbar vertebrae, whil&s;t all other quadrupeds
<PB N="232" REF="272">
have only five, &s;ix, or &s;even. The length of
its body is an effect of this &s;tructure; and it ap|pears
&s;till longer, becau&s;e it wants a tail. Were
it not for this defect of tail, and the uncommon
number of vertebrae, it might be comprehended
under the li&s;t of makis; for it re&s;embles them
in the hands and feet, in the quality of the hair,
in the number of teeth, and in the pointed
muzzle. But, independent of the &s;ingularity above
taken notice of, which removes this animal from
the makis, he has other peculiar qualities. His
head is entirely round, and his muzzle is almo&s;t
perpendicular to this &s;phere. His eyes are ex|ceedingly
large, and very near each other. His
ears are large, rounded, and garni&s;hed in the
in&s;ide with three auricles, in the form of a &s;mall
&s;hell. But, what is &s;till more remarkable, and
perhaps peculiar to this animal, the female di&s;|charges
her urine by the clitoris, which is per|forated
like the penis of the male; and the&s;e
two organs have a perfect re&s;emblance to each
other, both in figure and &s;ize.</P>
<P>Linnaeus has given a &s;hort, but excellent de|&s;cription
of this animal<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Statura &s;ciuri, &s;ubferruginea, linea dor&s;ali &s;ubfu&s;ca; gula albidiore, linea longitudinalis oculis interjecta alba.

bright yellow colour, like tho&s;e of certain
cats. Their muzzle is very &s;harp, and the
in&s;ide of their ears is yellow. They have no
tail...... When I examined them, they

<P>OF the various bats which were unknown,
we denominated &s;ome by names derived
from foreign languages, and others by appella|tions
drawn from their mo&s;t &s;triking characters.
The animal now under con&s;ideration we have
called the <HI>javelin bat,</HI> becau&s;e it has a mem|brane
on its no&s;e nearly of the &s;hape of an an|tient
javelin or &s;pear. Though this character be
&s;ufficient to di&s;tingui&s;h it from all other bats,
we may add, that it has almo&s;t not tail; that it
is nearly of the &s;ame colour and &s;ize with the
<PB N="235" REF="276">
common bat; but that, in&s;tead of having &s;ix
cutting teeth in the under jaw, like mo&s;t of the
other &s;pecies, it has only four. This bat, which
is very common in America, does not exi&s;t in
Europe.</P>
<P>In Senegal, there is another bat with a mem|brane
on its no&s;e; but this membrane, in&s;tead
of re&s;embling a javelin, or a hor&s;e &s;hoe, as in
this and a former &s;pecies, has the figure of an
oval leaf. The&s;e three bats, as they belong to
different climates, are not &s;imple varieties, but
di&s;tinct &s;pecies. M. Daubenton has de&s;cribed
this bat under the name of the <HI>leaf bat,</HI> in the
<HI>Memoirs of the Academy of Sciences, ann.</HI> 1759,
<HI>p.</HI> 374.</P>
<P>The bats, which are already greatly allied to
the birds by their flying, their wings, and the
&s;trength of their pectoral mu&s;cles, &s;eem to make
a &s;till nearer approach by the&s;e cre&s;ts or mem|branes
on their face. The&s;e redundant parts,
which, at fir&s;t &s;ight, appear to be &s;uperfluous
deformities, are the real characters, the vi&s;ible
&s;hades, by which Nature has connected the&s;e
flying quadrupeds to the birds; for mo&s;t of the
latter have membranes and cre&s;ts round their
bills and heads, which &s;eem to be equally &s;uper|fluous
with tho&s;e of the bats.</P>
<DIV3>
<PB N="236" REF="277">
<HEAD>SUPPLEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>M. Pallas, who &s;ent us de&s;criptions of two
new bats, the figures of which we now give,
informs us, that the javelin bat, formerly de&s;cri|bed,
&s;hould not be confounded with the bat de|&s;cribed
by Seba under the appellation of the
common American bat. M. Pallas, after com|paring
the two, a&s;&s;ures us, that they are very
different &s;pecies. Our acknowledgments are due
to M. Pallas for pointing out this mi&s;take.</P>
<P>He then gives a de&s;cription of one of the&s;e
new bats, which is a native of India. He calls
it <HI>cephalote,</HI> becau&s;e its head is very large in pro|portion
to its body. The neck is al&s;o more di|&s;tinct,
becau&s;e it is not &s;o thickly covered with
hair. The following is an extract from M.
Pallas's de&s;cription.</P>
<P>&startq;This bat, hitherto unknown to the Natu|rali&s;ts,
is found in the Molucca i&s;lands, from
which two females were &s;ent to M. Schlo&s;&s;er
at Am&s;terdam. The female &s;eems to produce
but one young. This conjecture is founded
on M. Pallas's di&s;&s;ection of one of the&s;e fe|males,
in which he found one foetus only.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;This bat,&endq; continues M. Pallas, &startq;differs from
all others in the teeth, which have &s;ome re|&s;emblance
to tho&s;e of the mou&s;e, or even of
<PB N="237" REF="278">
the hedge-hog, and appear to be rather de&s;ti|ned
for cutting fruits than for devouring prey.
The canine teeth of the upper jaw are &s;epa|rated
by two &s;mall teeth. In the under jaw,
the&s;e &s;mall teeth are wanting, and the two
canine teeth of the &s;ame jaw are like the cut|ting
teeth of a mou&s;e.&endq;</P>
<P>I &s;hall here add a table of the number and
arrangement of the teeth in the bat-kind, com|municated
to me by M. Daubenton; from which
it will appear, that the cephalotte, and the <HI>&s;hrew
bat,</HI> to be afterwards taken notice of, are new
&s;pecies di&s;covered by M. Pallas.</P>

&startq;The tail of the cephalotte bat,&endq; &s;ays M. Pal|las,
&startq;is not long, and is &s;ituated under the
membrane between the two thighs. The fi|gure
of the no&s;trils di&s;tingui&s;hes it from every
other bat. The form of the pupil likewi&s;e
differs from that of every other bat. The
brea&s;t is broad, and has a greater re&s;emblance
to the brea&s;t of a bird than any other &s;pecies.
This animal is about 3 &frac34; inches long, and its
wings extends above a foot in length.&endq;</P>
<P>The &s;econd &s;pecies of bats de&s;cribed by M.

leaf or membrane on its no&s;e. It is the &s;mal|le&s;t
of tho&s;e kinds which want the tail, being
only about two inches long. It is equally com|mon
in the warme&s;t regions of America, the
Caribbee i&s;lands, and Surinam. Its figure &s;eems
to be given by Edwards, <HI>plate 201. fig.</HI> 1. The
muzzle of this bat is longer, and more &s;lender
than in the other kinds. The tongue is re|markable

male and female hardly differ but in the organs
of generation.

&startq;The <HI>Maraput&eacute;,&endq;</HI> &s;ays P. Vincent-Marie,
which the Portugue&s;e in India call <HI>Serval,</HI> is a
ferocious animal, larger than a wild cat, and
&s;omewhat le&s;s than the civet; from which la&s;t
he differs, by having a rounder and larger
head, and a kind of depre&s;&s;ion on the middle
of the front. He re&s;embles the panther in the
colour of his hair, which is yellow on the head,
back, and flanks, and white on the belly; and
likewi&s;e in the &s;pots, which are di&s;tinct, equal|ly
di&s;tributed, and a little &s;maller than tho&s;e
of the panther. His eyes are extremely bril|liant.
<PB N="241" REF="288">
His whi&s;kers are long and &s;tiff; his
tail is &s;hort; and his feet are armed with long
hooked claws. He inhabits the mountains of
India. He is &s;eldom &s;een on the ground, but
remains always on the trees, where he makes
his ne&s;t, and &s;eizes birds, which con&s;titute his
chief nouri&s;hment. He leaps from tree to
tree as nimbly as a monkey, and with &s;uch ad|dre&s;s
and agility, that he runs through a con|&s;iderable
&s;pace in an in&s;tant, and may be &s;aid

unle&s;s when provoked, and particularly when
his dwelling is injured: He then becomes fu|rious,
darts upon the offender, and bites and
tears nearly in the &s;ame manner as the pan|ther.&endq;</P>
<P>Neither captivity, nor good or bad treatment,

we &s;aw at the menagerie was always prepared

<P>THE Ocelot is an American animal. It is
ferocious and carnivorous, and may be
ranked with the jaguar and couguar; for it ap|proaches
them in magnitude, and re&s;embles them
in figure and di&s;po&s;itions. A male and female
were brought alive to Paris by M. l'E&s;cot, and
<PB N="244" REF="292">
we &s;aw them at the fair of St Ovide in the month
of September 1764. They came from the
neighbourhood of Carthagena, and had been
carried off from their mother when very young,
in the month of October 1763. At the age of
three months, they had become &s;o &s;trong and
cruel, that they killed and eat a bitch which had
been given to them for a nur&s;e. At the age of
one year, when we &s;aw them, they were about
two feet in length; and it is probable that they
had not then acquired above one half or two
thirds of their full growth. They were exhi|bited

under the &s;ame denomination, though each of
the&s;e animals differ from one another, as well as
from the ocelot.</P>
<P>Fabri is the fir&s;t author who mentions this
animal in a di&s;tinct manner. He cau&s;ed the
drawings of Recchi to be engraved, and from
the&s;e drawings, which were coloured, he com|po&s;ed
a de&s;cription of the ocelot. He likewi&s;e
gives a kind of hi&s;tory of it from the writings
and information of Gregoire de Bolivar. I have
made the&s;e remarks with a view to remove a
difficulty which had deceived all the naturali&s;ts
as well as my&s;elf. This difficulty is to a&s;certain
whether the two animals drawn by Recchi, the
fir&s;t under the name of <HI>Tlatlauhqui-ocelotl,</HI> and
<PB N="245" REF="293">
the &s;econd under that of <HI>Tlacoozlotl, Tlalocelotl,</HI>
and afterwards de&s;cribed by Fabri as di&s;tinct
&s;pecies, are not the &s;ame animal. Though the
figures are pretty &s;imilar, they were regarded as
di&s;tinct animals, becau&s;e their names, and even
the de&s;criptions of them, were different. I at
that time imagined that the fir&s;t might be the
&s;ame with the jaguar, and therefore gave it the
Mexican name <HI>Tlatlauhqui-ocelotl,</HI> which I now
perceive did not belong to it: And, &s;ince I had
an opportunity of &s;eeing both the male and fe|male,
I am per&s;uaded that the two de&s;cribed by
Fabri, are only the &s;ame animal, of which the
fir&s;t is the male and the &s;econd the female. No|thing
le&s;s than an examination of the male and
female together could have enabled us to detect
this error. Of all &s;potted animals, the robe of
the male ocelot is unque&s;tionably the mo&s;t beau|tiful,
and the mo&s;t elegantly variegated<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Univer&s;um corpus pulchro ro&s;eoque &s;ubrubet colore, ex|cepto inferiore ventre qui albicat potius; maculis ro&s;arum effigie, nigricantibus omnibus intra &s;uave rubentem colorem, totum ita corpus, pedes et cauda ordine quodam di&s;tinguun|tur ut elegantem plane huic animali acu pictum tapetem vel peripeta&s;ma impo&s;itum crederes: Sunt autem maculae hae in dor&s;o et capite rotundiores majore&s;que: Ver&s;us ventrem vero pede&s;que oblongiu&s;culae et multo minores; <HI>Fabri apud Her|nand.

that of the leopard is not to be compared with it
for vivacity of colours, and &s;ymmetry of de&s;ign,
far le&s;s tho&s;e of the jaguar, panther, and ounce.
But, in the female ocelot, the colours are fainter,
<PB N="246" REF="294">
and the de&s;ign more irregular. This remark|able
difference deceived Recchi, Fabri<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Si animalis figuram &s;pectemus cum antecedente non nihil corporis delineatio congruit; &s;i colorem et maculas quibus pingitur, plurimum di&s;crepat.

<P>When the ocelot has acquired his full growth,
he is, according to Bolivar, two feet and a half
high, and about four feet in length. The tail,
though pretty long, touches not the ground, and,
of cour&s;e, exceeds not two feet. He is a very
voracious, and, at the &s;ame time, a timid ani|mal.
He &s;eldom attacks men, and is afraid of
dogs. When pur&s;ued, he flies to the woods, and
climbs a tree, where he remains, in order to
&s;leep, and to watch the pa&s;&s;age of cattle or &s;mal|ler
animals, and darts down upon them, when|ever
they are within his reach. He prefers
blood to fle&s;h: Hence he de&s;troys a great num|ber
of animals; becau&s;e, in&s;tead of &s;atiating him|&s;elf
by devouring their fle&s;h, he only quenches
his thir&s;t by drinking their blood<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Dampier mentions this animal under the name of the <HI>tiger-cat.</HI> &startq;The tiger cat of the Bay of Campeachy is about the &s;ize of a bull-dog.

In a &s;tate of captivity he retains his original
manners. Nothing can &s;often the natural fero|city
of his di&s;po&s;ition, or calm the re&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s of
his movements. For this rea&s;on, he is always

they eat from &s;even to eight pounds a-day.

animals for fle&s;h, the female never pre&s;umed
to partake till the male was &s;atiated, or gave
her the pieces he had rejected. I &s;ometimes
gave them a live cat, who&s;e blood they &s;ucked
till the animal died; but they never eat its
fle&s;h. I put on board two kids for their &s;ub|&s;i&s;tence;

<P>THE Margay is much &s;maller than the o|celot.
In &s;ize and figure, he re&s;embles the
wild cat, only his head is more &s;quare, his
muzzle and tail longer, and his ears more round|ed.
His hair is al&s;o &s;horter than that of the
wild cat, and he is marked with black bands and
&s;pots upon a yellow ground-colour. He was &s;ent
<PB N="250" REF="300">
to us from Cayenne, under the name of the
<HI>tiger-cat.</HI> He, indeed, is of the &s;ame nature with
the cat, jaguar, and ocelot, animals who have
received the appellation of <HI>tigers</HI> in the New
Continent. According to Fernandez, this ani|mal,
when full grown, is not &s;o large as the ci|vet;
and, according to Marcgrave, who&s;e com|pari&s;on
&s;eems to be more ju&s;t, he is of the &s;ize
of a wild cat, which he re&s;embles likewi&s;e in na|tural
di&s;po&s;itions, living on &s;mall animals, poul|try,
&amp;c. But it is extremely difficult to tame
him, and he never lo&s;es his natural ferocity.
His colours vary, though they are generally &s;uch
as we have repre&s;ented them. This animal is
very common in Guiana, Bra&s;il, and all the o|ther
regions of South America; and he &s;eems to
be the &s;ame with the pichou<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">The Pichou is a kind of cat as tall as a tiger, but not &s;o thick. His &s;kin is equally beautiful. He makes great deva|&s;tation among poultry; but happily he is not very common in Loui&s;iana; <HI>Hi&s;t. de la Loui&s;iane, par le Page du Pratz, tom. 2. p. 92. fig. p.</HI> 67.</NOTE> of Loui&s;iana.
But the &s;pecies is not &s;o frequent in temperate
as in warm climates.</P>
<P>If we take a &s;urvey of the&s;e cruel animals,
who&s;e &s;kins are &s;o beautiful, and who&s;e nature
is &s;o perfidious, we &s;hall find, in the Old Con|tinent,
the tiger, panther, leopard, ounce, and
&s;erval; and, in the New Continent, the jaguar,

the &s;ame &s;tature nor &s;trength; they are al&s;o timid
and da&s;tardly, in proportion as the others are
bold and intrepid.</P>
<P>There is &s;till another animal of this genus,
which the furriers call <HI>Gu&egrave;pard.</HI> We have &s;een
&s;everal &s;kins of it, which re&s;embled tho&s;e of the
lynx in the length of the hair. But, as the ears
are not terminated by pencils, the guepard is not
a lynx. Neither is he a panther nor a leopard;
for his hair is not &s;hort, and he has a mane of
four or five inches long on his neck and between
his &s;houlders. The hair on his belly is likewi&s;e
three or four inches in length, and his tail is
proportionally &s;horter than that of the panther,
leopard, or ounce. He is nearly of the &s;ize of
this la&s;t animal, being only about three feet and
a half long His fur, which is of a very pale
yellow colour, is &s;peckled, like that of the leo|pard,
with black &s;pots; but they are &s;maller and
nearer each other, being only three or four lines
in diameter.</P>
<P>I imagined that this animal was the &s;ame
with that mentioned by Kolbe under the name
of the <HI>tiger-wolf,</HI> who&s;e de&s;cription is below<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">He is of the &s;ize of a common dog, and &s;ometimes lar|ger. His head is as big as that of a bull dog. His chops, as well as his muzzle and eyes, are large, and his teeth are very &s;harp. His hair is curled, like that of a water|dog, and &s;potted like that of a tiger. His paws are large, and armed with great claws, which he retracts at plea&s;ure, like the cats. His tail is &s;hort.&mdash;The lion, tiger, and leopard are his mortal enemies.

He is common in the neighbourhood of the Cape
of Good Hope. During the day he remains in
the clefts of rocks, or in holes which he digs in
the earth; and, in the night, he goes in que&s;t
of prey. But, when he hunts, he makes a
howling noi&s;e, which alarms both men and ani|mals;
&s;o that it is ea&s;y either to avoid or to kill
him. In fine, the word <HI>gu&eacute;pard</HI> &s;eems to be
derived from <HI>l&egrave;pard,</HI> the mode in which the Ger|mans

neck.</P>

<HEAD>SUPPLEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>To the article <HI>Margay</HI> we mu&s;t refer the ti|ger-cat
of Cayenne, mentioned by M. de la
Borde in the following terms:</P>
<P>&startq;The &s;kin of the tiger-cat, like that of the
ounce, is very much &s;potted. Though he has
the di&s;po&s;itions of the fox, he is &s;omewhat &s;mall|er.
He is commonly found in the woods of
<PB N="253" REF="303">
Cayenne. He is a great de&s;troyer of game,
&s;uch as the agoutis, akonchis, partridges, phea|&s;ants,
and other birds, who&s;e young he &s;eizes
in their ne&s;ts. He is very alert in climbing
trees, where he conceals him&s;elf. He runs by
a kind of leaping; but his motion is not quick.
In his a&s;pect, gait, and manner of lying in wait,
he has a perfect re&s;emblance to the cat. At
Cayenne, I have &s;een &s;everal of them chained
in the hou&s;es. They allowed them&s;elves to
be &s;troaked a little on the back. But they al|ways
retained a degree of ferocity in their a|&s;pect.
They were fed with fi&s;h and meat,
boiled or raw: Every other food was di&s;agree|able
to them. They produce in all &s;ea&s;ons,
whether &s;ummer or winter, and bring forth two
at a time in the hollows of corrupted trees.&endq;</P>
<P>There is another tiger-cat, or rather a &s;pecies
of wild cat, in Carolina, of which the late Mr
Colin&s;on &s;ent me the following notice.</P>
<P>&startq;The male was of the &s;ize of a common cat,
being nineteen inches long from the no&s;e to the
tail, which la&s;t was four inches in length, and
had eight white rings, like the maucauco. His
colour was a bright brown, mixed with gray
hairs. He was remarkable for pretty large
black bars along the body and &s;ides, from the
head to the tail. The belly is whiti&s;h, with
black &s;pots. The limbs are &s;lender, and &s;potted
with black. His ears have a large aperture,
<PB N="254" REF="304">
and are covered with fine hair. On each &s;ide
of the no&s;e, below the eyes, are two large and
remarkable black &s;pots; below the&s;e &s;pots, and
joining the lip, there is a tuft of &s;tiff black hairs.
The make of the female is more &s;lender. She
is of a reddi&s;h gray colour, without any &s;pots
on the back; but, on the belly, which is of a
dirty white colour, there is a black &s;pot.&endq;

<P>WE are uncertain whether the&s;e two names
denote animals of different &s;pecies. We
only know, that the jackal is larger, fiercer, and
more difficult to tame than the adive<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">I have read, in &s;ome of our French chronicles, that, in the reign of Charles IX. many of the court ladies kept adives, in&s;tead of lap-dogs.</NOTE>; but that,
in every other article, the re&s;emblance is perfect.
Hence the adive may be only the jackal render|ed
&s;maller, feebler, and more gentle than the
wild race, by being tamed and kept in a dome|&s;tic
&s;tate; for the adive is to the jackal nearly
<PB N="356" REF="307">
what the lap-dog, or &s;mall water-dog, is to the
&s;hepherd's dog. However, as this fact is only
exemplified in a few in&s;tances; as the &s;pecies of
the jackal is not, in general, dome&s;tic, like that
of the dog; and, as differences &s;o great &s;eldom
happen among free &s;pecies; we are inclined to
believe that the jackal and adive are really two
di&s;tinct &s;pecies. The wolf, the fox, the jackal,
and the dog, though they approach very near
each other, con&s;titute four different &s;pecies. In
the dog-kind, the varieties are extremely nume|rous.
Mo&s;t of the&s;e originate from their do|me&s;tic
condition, to which they have been very
early reduced. Man has multiplied the races of
this &s;pecies by mixing the great and the &s;mall,
the beautiful and the ugly, the long and the
&s;hort haired, &amp;c. But, independent of the&s;e races
produced by man, there are &s;everal varieties which
&s;eem to derive their origin from the climate. The
Engli&s;h bull-dog, the Dani&s;h dog, the &s;paniel, the
Turki&s;h dog, the Siberian dog, &amp;c. have received
their denominations from the countries which pro|duced
them; and they appear to differ from each
other more than the jackal does from the adive.
Hence the jackals may have undergone &s;everal
changes from the influence of different climates;
and this idea corre&s;ponds with the facts we have
collected. From the writings of travellers it
appears that the jackals every where vary in
&s;ize; that in America, Cilicia, Per&s;ia, and in
all that part of A&s;ia called the <HI>Levant,</HI> where
<PB N="357" REF="308">
this &s;pecies is very numerous, trouble&s;ome, and
noxious; they are commonly as large as our
foxes<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">The jacard or adive is as large as a middle &s;ized dog, and re&s;embles the fox in its tail, and the wolf in its muzzle. They are reared in hou&s;es; but their natural di&s;po&s;ition is to conceal them&s;elves, during the day, in the earth, from which they go out in the night only to &s;earch for food. They go in packs, put the men to flight, and devour the children. Their cries are plaintive, and a per&s;on is apt to mi&s;take the noi&s;e they make for that of children of different ages min|gled together. The dogs hunt and drive the&s;e animals from the habitations of men; <HI>Voyage de Delon, p.</HI> 109.&mdash;In Per&s;ia there is a &s;pecies of fox called <HI>Schacal,</HI> which the na|tives commonly denominate <HI>Tulki.</HI> They are extremely nu|merous, and nearly of the &s;ize of European foxes. The back and &s;ides are covered with a kind of coar&s;e wool and long &s;tiff hairs. The belly is white as &s;now, the ears black as jet, and the tail is &s;maller than that of our foxes. We heard them roaming during the night around the village where we had put up, and were much troubled with their mourn|ful and ince&s;&s;ant cries, which re&s;embled the voices of men in di&s;tre&s;s; <HI>Voyage d'Olearius, p.</HI> 531. The addibo (<HI>adive</HI>) re|&s;embles the wolf in figure, hair, and tail. But it is &s;maller, and even le&s;s than the fox. It is an extremely voracious, but a &s;tupid animal. In the night it roams about, and re|mains in its hole during the day. In the du&s;k of the even|ing nothing el&s;e is to be &s;een in the fields. The&s;e animals approach travellers, and &s;top to reconnoitre them, without any appearance of fear. They enter the hou&s;es and churches, where they tear and devour every thing they can find. What|ever is made of leather is a favourite mor&s;el. The adive yelps like a fox; and when one cries, all the re&s;t reply. This in&s;tinct of crying all together &s;eems not to be voluntary, but to proceed from pure nece&s;&s;ity; for, when one of them enters into a hou&s;e to &s;teal, and hears the cries of his companions at a di&s;tance, he cannot refrain from crying al&s;o, and by this means detects him&s;elf; <HI>Voyage du P.

This animal has &s;o great a re&s;emblance to the fox in &s;ize, figure, and colour, that mo&s;t travellers are at fir&s;t deceived with it. The greate&s;t difference between them is in the head, the chacali having a head like a &s;hep|herd's dog with a long muzzle, and in the hair, which is coar&s;e like that of the wolf. Its colour is al&s;o &s;imilar to that of the wolf; and it &s;ends forth a &s;tench, which infects every thing it touches.&mdash;This animal is extremely bold and vora|cious.&mdash;He is not afraid to enter the hou&s;es.&mdash;When he meets a man, in&s;tead of flying in&s;tantly, like other animals, he looks at him with as much boldne&s;s as if he meant to brave him, and then runs off. He is very mi&s;chievous, and always apt to bite, whatever care is taken to &s;often him by care&s;&s;es, or by giving him food. The one formerly men|tioned, though taken when very young, and reared with as much attention as a favourite dog, was never rendered perfect|ly tame: He allowed no body to touch him, and bit every per&s;on indi&s;criminately. He could never be prevented from leaping on the table, and carrying off every thing he could lay hold of. All the country of Natolia is crowded with the&s;e chacalis. During the night, they make a hideous noi&s;e round the villages, not only by barking like dogs, but by a certain &s;harp cry which is peculiar to them; <HI>Voyage de Dumont, tom. 4. p.</HI> 29.</NOTE>, only their legs are &s;horter, and their

<P>However, as the jackals and adives are found
in the &s;ame countries, as the &s;pecies could not
be degraded by continuing long in a dome&s;tic
<PB N="261" REF="312">
&s;tate, and as there is always a con&s;iderable diffe|rence
both in the &s;ize and di&s;po&s;itions of the&s;e
animals, we &s;hall regard them as di&s;tinct &s;pecies,
till it be proven by facts that they intermix and
produce together. Our conjecture concerning
the difference of the&s;e two &s;pecies is the better
founded, as it &s;eems to accord with the opinion
of the antients. Ari&s;totle, after mentioning the
wolf, the fox, and the hyaena, gives &s;ome ob|&s;cure
intimations with regard to two other ani|mals
of the &s;ame genus, the one under the name
of the <HI>panther,</HI> and the other under that of <HI>thos.</HI>
The tran&s;lators of Ari&s;totle have rendered <HI>pan|ther</HI>
by <HI>lupus canarius,</HI> and <HI>thos</HI> by <HI>lupus cerva|rius.</HI>
From this interpretation, it is obvious,
that they con&s;idered the panther and thos to be
animals of the &s;ame &s;pecies. But I demon&s;tra|ted,
under the article <HI>Lynx,</HI> that the <HI>lupus cerva|rius</HI>
of the Latins is not the <HI>thos</HI> of the Greeks.
This <HI>lupus cervarius</HI> is the &s;ame with the <HI>chaus</HI>
of Pliny, and with our lynx, which has not a
&s;ingle character that agrees with the <HI>thos.</HI> Ho|mer,
when celebrating the prowe&s;s of Ajax,
who alone attacked a band of Trojans, in the
mid&s;t of whom Uly&s;&s;es found him&s;elf engaged,
after being wounded, compares him to a lion,
who &s;uddenly falls upon a troop of <HI>thos</HI> collec|ted
round a &s;tag at bay, di&s;per&s;es, and pur&s;ues
them, as mean and da&s;tardly animals. The
commentator of Homer interprets the word <HI>thos</HI>
by <HI>panther,</HI> which, he &s;ays, is a kind of weak,
<PB N="262" REF="313">
timid wolf. Thus the thos and panther have
been regarded as the &s;ame animal by &s;everal an|tient
Greeks. But Ari&s;totle appears to have di|&s;tingui&s;hed
them, though he has not a&s;&s;igned to
them different characters: &startq;The internal parts of
the <HI>thos,</HI>&endq; &s;ays he, &startq;are &s;imilar to tho&s;e of the
wolf<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Ari&s;tot. hi&s;t. anim. lib. 2. cap. 17.</NOTE>.... They copulate like dogs<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Idem, lib. 6. cap. 35.</NOTE>, and
produce two, three, or four young, who are
born blind. The body and tail of the thos
are longer than tho&s;e of the dog; but, though
the former is not &s;o tall, he is extremely nim|ble,
and leaps to a great di&s;tance.... The
lion and thos are enemies<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Idem, lib. 9. cap. 1.</NOTE>, becau&s;e they both
feed upon fle&s;h, and mu&s;t, therefore, di&s;pute
about their prey.... The thos loves men<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Idem, lib. 9. cap. 44.</NOTE>,
and never attacks them; neither does he &s;eem
to be much afraid of them. He fights with
the dog and the lion. For this rea&s;on the lion
and thos are never &s;een in the &s;ame places.
The &s;malle&s;t thos are the be&s;t. There are
two &s;pecies of them, and &s;ome extend them to
three.&endq; Ari&s;totle &s;ays no more on the &s;ubject
of the thos, and he &s;ays &s;till le&s;s concerning
the panther. It is mentioned only in one
pa&s;&s;age, namely, in the 35th chapter of the
16th book of his hi&s;tory of animals: &startq;The
panther produces four young, which are blind
<PB N="263" REF="314">
at birth, like the young wolves.&endq; From com|paring
the&s;e pa&s;&s;ages with that of Homer, and
tho&s;e of other Greek authors, it appears to be
almo&s;t certain, that the thos of Ari&s;totle is the
large jackal, and that the panther is the &s;mall
jackal, or adive. We &s;ee that he admits the ex|i&s;tence
of two &s;pecies of thos; that he mentions
the panther but once, and when treating of the
thos: It is therefore probable, that this panther
is the &s;mall kind of thos; and this probability
becomes almo&s;t a certainty from the te&s;timony
of Oppian<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Oppian. de venatione, lib. 2.</NOTE>, who ranks the panther among the
number of &s;mall animals, &s;uch as the cats and
dormice.</P>
<P>Hence the thos is the jackal, and the panther
the adive: And, whether they con&s;titute two
&s;pecies, or but one, it is certain, that all the an|tients
have &s;aid, with regard to the thos and
panther, applies to the jackal and adive, and to
no other animals. If we have remained unac|quainted
with the true meaning of the&s;e names
till now, it mu&s;t be a&s;cribed to the ignorance of
the tran&s;lators, and of our modern naturali&s;ts.</P>
<P>Though the &s;pecies of the wolf approaches
near to that of the dog, yet the jackal is inter|po&s;ed
between them. <HI>The jackal or adive,</HI> as
Belon remarks, <HI>is an animal between a wolf and
a dog.</HI> With the ferocity of the wolf, he po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;es

<P>IF a number of re&s;emblances, joined to a per|fect
conformity of internal parts, were &s;uf|ficient
to con&s;titute unity of &s;pecies, the wolf,
the fox, and the dog, would form but one; for
the re&s;emblances are more numerous than the
differences, and the &s;imilarity of the internal parts
<PB N="269" REF="325">
is complete. The&s;e three animals, however, not
only con&s;titute three di&s;tinct &s;pecies, but are &s;o
di&s;tant from each other, as to admit intermediate
&s;pecies. The jackal is an intermediate &s;pecies
between the dog and wolf; and the i&s;atis is pla|ced
between the fox and dog. The i&s;atis has
hitherto been regarded as a variety of the fox.
But the de&s;cription given of it by Gmelin de|mon&s;trates
it to be a different &s;pecies.</P>
<P>The i&s;atis is common in all the northern re|gions
bordering on the frozen &s;ea, and is never
found on this &s;ide of the 69th degree of latitude.
In the figure of the body, and the length of the
tail, he is perfectly &s;imilar to the fox; but his
head has a greater re&s;emblance to that of the
dog. His hair is &s;ofter than that of the com|mon
fox, and his fur is &s;ometimes white, and
&s;ometimes of a blui&s;h a&s;h-colour. The head is
&s;hort in proportion to the body; it is broad near
the neck, and is terminated by a &s;harp muzzle.
The ears are almo&s;t round. He has five toes
and five claws on the fore feet, and only four
on tho&s;e behind. The penis of the male is
&s;carcely &s;o thick as a goo&s;e quill. The te&s;ticles
are as large as almonds, and are &s;o concealed
with the hair, that it is difficult to perceive them.
The hair over the whole body is about two inches
long, &s;mooth, bu&s;hy, and &s;oft as wool. The
no&s;trils and under lip are naked, and the &s;kin of
the&s;e parts is black.</P>
<P><PB N="270" REF="326">
In both male and female, the &s;tomach, vi&s;cera,
inte&s;tines, and &s;permatic ve&s;&s;els, are &s;imilar to
tho&s;e of the dog: There is even a bone in the
penis of the male, and the whole &s;keleton re|&s;embles
that of a fox.</P>
<P>The voice of the i&s;atis partakes of the barking
of a dog and the yelping of a fox. The mer|chants
who deal in furs di&s;tingui&s;h two kinds of
i&s;atis, the one white and the other of a blui&s;h
a&s;h-colour. The latter are mo&s;t e&s;teemed, and
their price advances in proportion to their blue|ne&s;s
or brownne&s;s. This difference of colour is
not &s;ufficient to con&s;titute a difference of &s;pecies;
for M. Gmelin was a&s;&s;ured by the mo&s;t experi|enced
hunters, that, in the &s;ame litter, &s;ome of
the young are white, and others a&s;h-coloured.</P>
<P>The i&s;atis is an animal peculiar to the northern
regions. He prefers the coa&s;ts of the frozen &s;ea,
and the banks of the rivers which fall into it.
He loves open countries, and never frequents

The quick-hatch of Edwards<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Edwards's hi&s;tory of birds, p. 103.</NOTE>, which appears

double the &s;ize of a fox: Its back is arched, its

in the northern regions of Europe, A&s;ia, and
America. M. Gmelin<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">The glutton is the only animal, which, like man, can live equally well under the Line and under the Pole.

&s;eems to think that the glutton travels into warm
countries. But this fact appears to be very
&s;u&s;picious, if not altogether fal&s;e. Gmelin, like
&s;ome other naturali&s;ts<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Bri&s;&s;on, regn. anim. p. 235.</NOTE>, has perhaps confounded

are very different animals.</P>
<P><PB N="277" REF="334">
The legs of the glutton are not made for run|ning;
he even walks &s;low. But this defect of
nimblene&s;s he &s;upplies with cunning. He lies
in wait for animals as they pa&s;s. He climbs
upon trees, in order to dart upon his prey, and
&s;eize it with advantage. He throws him&s;elf
down upon elks and rain-deer, and fixes &s;o firm|ly
on their bodies with his claws and teeth, that
nothing can remove him. In vain do the poor
victims fly, and rub them&s;elves again&s;t trees.
The enemy, attached to their crupper or neck,
continues to &s;uck their blood, to enlarge the
wound, and to devour them gradually, and with
equal voracity, till they fall down<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">The glutton is a carnivorous animal, &s;omewhat le&s;s than the wolf. His hair is coar&s;e, long, and of a brown colour, approaching to black, e&s;pecially on the back. He climbs upon a tree to watch for his prey; and, when any animal pa&s;&s;es, he &s;prings down upon its back, fixes him&s;elf firmly with his claws, and continues to gnaw with his teeth, till the poor animal, after many fruitle&s;s efforts to get rid of &s;o trouble|&s;ome a gue&s;t, at la&s;t falls down, and becomes a victim to this crafty enemy.

how long the glutton can eat, and
how much fle&s;h he can devour at a meal.</P>
<P>What is related by travellers, concerning this
animal, is perhaps exaggerated. But, though a
great part of their narrations were rejected,
what remains<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Hoc animal voraci&s;&s;imum e&s;t; reperto namque cadavere, tantum vorat, ut violento cibo corpus in&s;tar tympani exten|datur; inventaque angu&s;tia inter arbores &s;e &s;tringit ut violen|tius egerat: Sicque extenuatum revertitur ad cadaver, et ad &s;ummum u&s;que repletur, iterumque &s;e &s;tringit angu&s;tia pri|ore, &amp;c.; <HI>Olai Magni hi&s;t. de Gent. &s;ept. pag.</HI> 138.</NOTE> is &s;ufficient to convince us, that
<PB N="278" REF="335">
the glutton is much more voracious than any of
our carnivorous animals: From this circum|&s;tance
he has been called the <HI>vulture of quadru|peds.</HI>
More in&s;atiable and rapacious than the
wolf, if endowed with equal agility, the glutton
would de&s;troy all the other animals. But he
moves &s;o heavily, that the only animal he is
able to overtake in the cour&s;e is the beaver,
who&s;e cabbins he &s;ometimes attacks, and de|vours
the whole, unle&s;s they quickly take to the
water<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">The carcajou is a &s;mall animal, but very &s;trong and fierce. Though carnivorous, he is &s;o &s;low and heavy, that he may be &s;aid rather to trail upon the &s;now, than to walk. The beaver is the only animal he is able to overtake; and this exploit he can perform in &s;ummer only, when the beavers are out of their cabbins: But, in winter, he endeavours to demoli&s;h their cabbins, and &s;eize the inhabitants, which he is &s;eldom able to accompli&s;h; becau&s;e the beavers &s;ecure their retreat under the ice; <HI>Hi&s;t. de l'Acad. des Sciences, ann&eacute;e</HI> 1713.</NOTE>; for the beaver out&s;trips him in &s;wim|ming.
When he perceives that his prey has
e&s;caped, he &s;eizes the fi&s;hes; and, when he can
find no living creature to de&s;troy, he goes in
que&s;t of the dead, whom he digs up from their
graves, and devours with avidity.</P>
<P>Though the glutton employs con&s;iderable art
and addre&s;s in &s;eizing other animals, he &s;eems
to po&s;&s;e&s;s no other talents but tho&s;e which relate
<PB N="279" REF="336">
to appetite. It would appear that he even wants
the common in&s;tinct of &s;elf-pre&s;ervation. He
allows him&s;elf to be approached by men, or
comes up to them<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">The workmen perceived at a di&s;tance an animal approach|ing with &s;low and &s;olemn &s;teps. Some of them imagined it to be a bear, and others a glutton. They advanced, and found that it was a glutton. After giving it &s;ome &s;evere blows with a cudgel, they &s;eized it alive, and brought it to me..... After the many reports I had for &s;everal years heard from the Siberian hunters, concerning the addre&s;s of the glutton in &s;eizing other animals, and &s;upplying, by cun|ning, that &s;wiftne&s;s which Nature has denied him, and in a|voiding the &s;nares of men, I was greatly &s;urpri&s;ed to &s;ee this one come as deliberately up to us, as if he had been in que&s;t of his own de&s;truction. Y&s;brandt-ides calls the glutton a mi&s;|chievous animal, which lives only on fle&s;h. &startq;He is accu&s;tom|ed,&endq; this author remarks, &startq;to conceal him&s;elf in the trees, and to lie in ambu&s;h, like the lynx, till a &s;tag, a rain-dear, a roebuck, a hare, &amp;c. pa&s;&s;es below, and then darts down, like an arrow, upon the animal, &s;inks his teeth into its body, and gnaws the fle&s;h till it expires; after which, he devours it at his ea&s;e, and &s;wallows both the hair and the &s;kin. A waywode, who kept a glutton for his plea&s;ure, threw it one day into the water, and let loo&s;e two dogs at it. But the glutton &s;oon fixed upon the head of one of the dogs, and kept it under the water till the animal was &s;uffocated.&endq;.. The addre&s;s employed by the glutton, continues M. Gmelin, in &s;eizing animals, is confirmed by all the hunters... Though he devours all kinds of animals, whether alive or dead, he prefers the rain-deer.... He watches large animals like a robber on the highways, or he &s;urpri&s;es them while a&s;leep... He goes in que&s;t of the &s;nares laid by the hunters for diffe|rent &s;pecies of animals; but he never allows him&s;elf to be entrapped... The hunters of the blue and white foxes (i&s;atis), which frequent the coa&s;ts of the frozen &s;ea, complain much of the mi&s;chief done them by the glutton.... With much propriety they call him the <HI>glutton;</HI> for the quantity he eats is incredible. Though I frequently inquired of profe&s;&s;ed hunters, I never heard that this animal, when gorged, &s;quee|zed him&s;elf between two clo&s;e trees, in order to force out the contents of his &s;tomach, and to make room for a fre&s;h grati|fication of his in&s;atiable appetite. This appears to have been the fable of a naturali&s;t, or the fiction of a painter; <HI>Voyage de Gmelin, tom. 3. p. 492.&mdash;Nota.</HI> Olaus fir&s;t put this fable in writing, and Ge&s;ner copied the figure of it, which had been de&s;igned by a painter.</NOTE>, without betraying the
<PB N="280" REF="337">
&s;malle&s;t apprehen&s;ion. This indifference, which
&s;eems to be the effect of imbecillity, proceeds,
perhaps, from a different cau&s;e. It is certain,
that the glutton is not &s;tupid, &s;ince he finds
means to &s;atisfy his appetite, which is always
vehement and pre&s;&s;ing. Neither is he deficient
in courage, &s;ince he indi&s;criminately attacks all
animals he meets with, and betrays no &s;ymp|toms
of fear at the approach of man. Hence,
if he wants attention to him&s;elf, it proceeds not
from indifference to his own pre&s;ervation, but
from the habit of &s;ecurity. As he lives in a
country which is almo&s;t de&s;ert, he &s;eldom &s;ees
men, who are his only enemies. Every time
he tries his &s;trength with other animals, he finds
him&s;elf their &s;uperior. He goes about with per|fect
confidence, and never di&s;covers the &s;malle&s;t
mark of fear, which always &s;uppo&s;es &s;ome do|lorous
event, &s;ome experience of weakne&s;s. Of
this we have an example in the lion, who never
turns away from man, unle&s;s he has experien|ced
the force of his arms: And the glutton,
<PB N="281" REF="338">
trailing along the &s;nows of his de&s;ert climate,
remains always in perfect &s;afety, and reigns,
like the lion, not &s;o much by his own &s;trength,
as by the weakne&s;s of the animals around him.</P>
<P>The i&s;atis is not &s;o &s;trong, but much more
nimble than the glutton, whom it &s;erves as a
provider. The glutton follows the i&s;atis in the
chace, and often carries off the whole, or a part
of its prey; for, when the glutton arrives, the
i&s;atis, to avoid its own de&s;truction, flies off with
precipitation. Both the&s;e animals dig holes in
the earth; but their other manners are different.
The i&s;atis often goes in packs: But the glutton
travels alone, or &s;ometimes with his female.
The male and female are generally found to|gether
in the &s;ame hole. Even the mo&s;t cou|rageous

&s;o tame, that he di&s;covered no ferocity, and did

between the fore feet, the hair is &s;potted with

inches, and that of the hind one foot. The tail,
including four inches of hair at its extremity, is
eight inches long. The four legs, the tail, the
back, as well as the belly, are black. Near the
navel is a white &s;pot, and the organs of genera|tion
are reddi&s;h. The under hair, or down, is
white: His fore feet, from the heel to the ex|tremity
of the claws, are three inches nine lines
in length. The five claws are very crooked and
well &s;eparated. The middle claw is an inch and a
half long. There are five callo&s;ities under the toes;
four of them form a kind of &s;emicircle below the
foot, the other is on the heel. On the hind feet,
there are five claws, nine callo&s;ities, and no heel.
<PB N="284" REF="341">
The breadth of the fore feet is two inches and a
half. The length of the hind feet is four inches
nine lines, and their breadth two inches nine
lines. He has &s;ix cutting teeth in the upper jaw,
of which one on each &s;ide is larger than the other
four; and five grinders, two of which are much
larger than the other three. In the under jaw,
he has five grinders, one of which is very thick.
There are a few hairs, about two inches long,
round the mouth, and above the eyes.</P>
<P>This animal is pretty mild. He avoids wa|ter,
and dreads hor&s;es, and men dre&s;&s;ed in black.
He walks by a kind of leaps; and eats pretty vo|raciou&s;ly.
After taking a full meal, he covers
him&s;elf in his cage with &s;traw. When drink|ing,
he laps like a dog. He utters no cry. Af|ter
drinking, with his paws he throws the re|mainder
of the water on his belly. He is almo&s;t
perpetually in motion. If allowed, he would
devour more than four pounds of fle&s;h every
day. He eats no bread; and devours his food
&s;o voraciou&s;ly, and almo&s;t without chewing, that
he is apt to choke him&s;elf.</P>
<P>The glutton is common in mo&s;t of the nor|thern
regions of Europe, and even of A&s;ia; but,
in Norway, according to Pontoppidan, he is
chiefly confined to the dioce&s;e of Drontheim.
This author remarks, that the &s;kin of the glutton
is very valuable; that he is not &s;hot with fire-arms,
to prevent his &s;kin from being damaged;
<PB N="285" REF="342">
and that the hair is &s;oft, and of a black colour,
&s;haded with brown and yellow<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Pontoppidan's Natural Hi&s;tory of Norway.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>We have likewi&s;e given the figure of an Ame|rican
animal, a &s;tuffed &s;kin of which was &s;ent to
M. Aubry, curate of St Louis, under the deno|mination
of <HI>Carcajou.</HI> But it has no affinity to
that animal, which we remarked was the &s;ame
with our European glutton; for, as its claws are
not adapted for tearing prey, but for digging the
earth, we con&s;ider it as a neighbouring &s;pecies,
or even as a variety, of the badger. When com|pared
with the figure we have given of the bad|ger,
the re&s;emblance is apparent; from which it
differs, however, by having only four toes on
the fore feet: But the fifth toe, which was ap|parently
wanting, might have been de&s;troyed in
this dried &s;kin. In this character, it differs e|qually
from the carcajou and the glutton; be|cau&s;e
both of them have five toes on the fore
feet. Hence it is doubtful whether this animal
be the true carcajou. We &s;hall here add a de|&s;cription
of the &s;tuffed &s;kin, which is very well
pre&s;erved in the cabinet of M. Aubry. He was
a&s;&s;ured that it was brought from the country of
the E&s;kimaux. From the end of the muzzle to
the origin of the tail, it was two feet two inches
long. Though it has a great re&s;emblance to the
badger, it differs from him in the colour and
quality of the hair, which is &s;ofter, longer, and
more &s;ilky; and, by this character alone, it ap|proaches
<PB N="286" REF="343">
to the carcajou, or the glutton of Eu|rope.
It is nearly of the colour of the lynx,
being grayi&s;h white, with white &s;tripes on the
head, but different from tho&s;e of the badger.
The ears are &s;hort and white. It has thirty-two
teeth, &s;ix inci&s;ors, two large canine teeth, and
four grinders on each &s;ide; but the badger has
only &s;ix grinders. The hairs on the body, which
are commonly four and a half or five inches
long, are of four colours, namely, from the root
to near the middle, they are a bright brown, then
a bright yellow, then black, till near the point,
which is white. The under part of the body is
covered with white hairs. On the legs the hair
is of a deep brown colour. There are four toes
only on the fore feet, and five on tho&s;e behind.
The claws of the fore feet are very large; the
longe&s;t on the fore feet are &s;ixteen lines, and the
longe&s;t on the hind feet only &s;even. The trunk
of the tail is three inches eight lines in length,
and it is terminated and &s;urrounded by long
yellow hairs.</P>
<P>I am convinced that the American carcajou is
the &s;ame animal with the European glutton, or,
at lea&s;t, that it is a &s;pecies very nearly allied to
the glutton. But I mu&s;t remark, that I com|mitted
a mi&s;take, occa&s;ioned by a &s;imilarity of
names, and &s;ome natural habits, common to two
different animals. I imagined that the kinkajou
was the &s;ame animal with the carcajou. This
error I di&s;covered by &s;eeing two animals, the
<PB N="287" REF="344">
one at the fair of St Germain, in 1773, announ|ced
by a bill as <HI>an animal unknown to all the na|turali&s;ts,</HI>
which was true. Another, altogether
&s;imilar, is now alive at Paris, in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of
M. Chauveau, who brought it from New Spain.
We believe it to be the true kinkajou, and have
here given a figure of it. M. Chauveau imagi|ned
that it might be an acouchi or a coati. He
remarks, indeed, that it has neither the long no&s;e
nor the annulated tail of the coati; but that it
has the &s;ame hair, the &s;ame members, the &s;ame
number of toes, and the &s;ame canine teeth, which
are angular and chamfered on the &s;ides. M.
Chauveau acknowledges, that it differs from the
coati by its prehen&s;ile tail, with which, when de|&s;cending,
it &s;u&s;pends it&s;elf, and adheres to every
thing it can lay hold of.</P>
<P>&startq;This animal,&endq; &s;ays M. Chauveau, &startq;never
&s;tretches out his tail, unle&s;s when his feet are
&s;ecure. He employs it with greater dexterity
in &s;eizing and bringing to him &s;uch things as
he cannot otherwi&s;e reach. He lies down and
&s;leeps as &s;oon as day appears, and awakes
at the approach of night. His vivacity is
then extremely great. He climbs with great
facility, and &s;earches about continually. He
tears every thing he finds, either for amu&s;e|ment
or in que&s;t of in&s;ects. Were it not for
this fault, he might be left at liberty. Even
before his arrival in France, he went about
freely during the night, and next day he was
<PB N="288" REF="345">
always found lying in the &s;ame place. He
may be wakened during the day; but the rays
of the &s;un &s;eem to be extremely incommodi|ous
to him. He is care&s;&s;ing, without being
tractable:. He di&s;tingui&s;hes his ma&s;ter alone,
whom he follows. He drinks water, coffee,
milk, wine, and even aquavitae; which la&s;t,
when &s;ugar is added to it, he drinks till he be
intoxicated, and continues to be &s;ick for &s;everal
days. He eats indi&s;criminately bread, meat,
pot-herbs, roots, and fruits. His common
food, for a long time, has been bread &s;oaked
in milk, fruits, and pot-herbs. He is pa&s;&s;ion|ately
fond of odours, &s;ugar, and confections.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;He attacks poultry, and always &s;eizes them
under the wing. He &s;eems to drink their
blood; for he never devours them. When
he has his choice, he prefers a duck to a hen;
and yet he is afraid of water. He has differ|ent
cries: When alone during the night, he
utters &s;ounds nearly &s;imilar to the barking of
a dog, and he always commences with &s;nee|zing.
When he &s;ports, or receives any injury,
he cries like a young pigeon. When he threa|tens,
he whi&s;tles like a goo&s;e; and, when en|raged,
his cries are loud and confu&s;ed. He is
never in a pa&s;&s;ion but when hungry. His
tongue, which he &s;ometimes thru&s;ts out, is
immoderately long. The one in my po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion
was a female; and, it is worthy of remark,
that, during the three years &s;he has been in
<PB N="289" REF="346">
France, &s;he was only once in &s;ea&s;on, and was
then extremely furious.&endq;</P>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>The following is M. de S&egrave;ve's de&s;cription of a
&s;imilar animal, exhibited at the fair of St Ger|main
in the year 1773.</HEAD>
<P>&startq;By its fur, it has a greater re&s;emblance to
the otter than to any other animal; but its
toes are not connected by membranes. The
tail is as long as the body; but that of the ot|ter
is only half the length of its body. When
walking, the length of its body gives it the air
of a polecat. But the tail and figure of the
head are different, and the latter has more re|&s;emblance
to that of the otter. The eye is
larger than that of the polecat. The face has
&s;ome re&s;emblance to that of the &s;mall Dani&s;h
dog. His tongue is long, thin, and &s;mooth.
He appears to be of a mild di&s;po&s;ition, and
licks the hand of any per&s;on. La&s;t Lent, when
I drew its figure, it was very gentle; but it
has been rendered mi&s;chievous by being fre|quently
irritated by the populace. At pre&s;ent,
it &s;ometimes bites after licking the hand. It
is young, and its teeth &s;eem not to be fully
formed. It is of a re&s;tle&s;s di&s;po&s;ition, and
loves to climb. It often &s;its on end, &s;cratches
<PB N="290" REF="347">
it&s;elf with its fore feet like the apes, plays,
folds its paws into each other, and performs
many other monkey tricks. Like the &s;quirrel,
it holds fruits and other food between its two
paws. Neither fle&s;h nor fi&s;h is given to it.
When irritated, it endeavours to leap upon the
per&s;on, and its cry has a con&s;iderable re&s;em|blance
to that of a large rat. Its fur has no
odour. With great dexterity it hooks with its
tail &s;uch things as it wants to lay hold of, and
frequently hangs by the tail upon &s;uch bodies as
it meets with. I have remarked, that its toes,
which are of a con&s;iderable length, &s;pontane|ou&s;ly
unite, when it walks or climbs; and they
&s;pread not, like tho&s;e of other animals, in the
action of &s;upporting it&s;elf. In fine, this ani|mal,
according to the account given by its ma|&s;ter,
came from the coa&s;t of Africa, where it
was called <HI>kinkajou,</HI> and the &s;pecies is &s;aid to
be rare. This appellation, he &s;uppo&s;ed, was
derived from the name of the i&s;land or coun|try
which it inhabits, being unable to learn any
more from the per&s;on who &s;old it to him. I
&s;hall only &s;ay, that this kinkajou, which is a
female, approaches nearer to the otter than to
any other quadruped. Its hair is &s;hort and
thick, mixed with &s;ome longer hairs. The
hairs of the head, like tho&s;e of the body and
tail, are of an olive yellowi&s;h colour, mingled
with gray and brown; and the&s;e colours vary
according to the light in which they are view|ed.
<PB N="291" REF="348">
The colour of each hair, through its
greate&s;t extent, is a grayi&s;h white, and a du&s;ky
greeni&s;h yellow at the point. The fur is mix|ed
with other hairs, who&s;e extremity is brown,
be&s;ide large black hairs inter&s;per&s;ed among the
re&s;t, which form bands on the &s;ides of the eyes,
and extend toward the front, and another band
which vani&s;hes near the neck. The eye is very
&s;imilar to that of the otter. The pupil is &s;mall,
and the iris is of a reddi&s;h colour. The muzzle
is blacki&s;h brown, as well as round the eyes.
As in &s;mall dogs, the end of the no&s;e is flat,
and the no&s;trils are much arched. The teeth
are yellow, and thirty-two in number. The
canine teeth are very large, the &s;uperior cro&s;s|ing
the inferior. There are twelve cutting
teeth, four canine, and &s;ixteen grinders. The
ears are longer than broad, rounded at the
points, and covered with &s;hort hair, of the
&s;ame colour with that on the body. The &s;ides,
throat, and in&s;ide of the legs, are of a golden
yellow colour, which is extremely vivid in
&s;ome places. The &s;ame golden colour prevails
on &s;ome parts of the head and hind legs. The
belly is grayi&s;h white, tinged in &s;ome places
with yellow. The tail, which is every where
covered with hair, is thick at the origin, and
gradually tapers to a point at the extremity.
When walking, the animal carries its tail ho|rizontally.
The under part of the paws is
naked, and of a vermilion colour. The claws
<PB N="292" REF="349">
are white, hooked, and guttered below. The
length of the whole animal is about two feet
five inches.&endq;</P>
<P>The &s;imilarity of the names <HI>kinkajou</HI> and <HI>car|cojou</HI>
led me, as well as other naturali&s;ts, to ima|gine,
that they belonged to the &s;ame animal:
In the following pa&s;&s;age from Denis, formerly
quoted in part only, where he tells us, that the
kinkajou, which I then apprehended to be the
carcajou, re&s;embled the cat, I thought this tra|veller
had been deceived; becau&s;e all other tra|vellers
agree in making the figure of the carca|jou
&s;imilar to that of the glutton.</P>
<P>&startq;The kinkajou,&endq; &s;ays Denis, &startq;has &s;ome re|&s;emblance
to the cat with browni&s;h red hair.
Its tail is long, and erected on its back in two
or three folds. It has claws, and climbs trees,
where it lies in wait along the branches to dart
down on its prey. In this manner it &s;eizes
the orignal, inve&s;ts him with its tail, and gnaws
his neck till he falls. Notwith&s;tanding the
&s;wiftne&s;s of the orignal, and the force with
which he rubs again&s;t the trees and bru&s;h|wood,
the kinkajou never quits its hold; but,
if he can reach the water, he is &s;aved, becau&s;e
the kinkajou is then obliged to &s;eparate from
him. Four years ago, a kinkajou attacked
one of my heifers, and cut its throat. The
kinkajous are hunted by the foxes. They
go in que&s;t of the kinkajou when he lies in
<PB N="293" REF="350">
wait for the original, and never fail to carry
him off<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">De&s;cript. geogr. et hi&s;tor. des c&ocirc;tes de l'Amerique Septent. par M. Denis, tom. 2. p. 327.</NOTE>.&endq;</P>
<P>The&s;e facts corre&s;pond &s;o well with the figure,
and de&s;cription we have given of this animal,
that we may pre&s;ume that they relate to the
&s;ame animal, and that the carcajou and kinkajou
are two di&s;tinct &s;pecies, who have nothing in
common, except their darting upon the original
and other quadrupeds, in order to drink their
blood.</P>
<P>We formerly remarked, that the kinkajou was
found in the mountains of New Spain: But he
is likewi&s;e found in tho&s;e of Jamaica, where the
natives call him <HI>poto.</HI> Mr Colin&s;on &s;ent me a
figure of this poto or kinkajou, which I have in|&s;erted,
together with the following notice.</P>
<P>&startq;The body of this animal,&endq; &s;ays Mr Colin&s;on,
&startq;is red, mixed with a&s;h-colour. The hair is
&s;hort, but very thick, the head rounded, the
muzzle &s;hort, naked, and blacki&s;h: The eyes
are brown, the ears &s;hort and round, and the
hairs round the mouth are long; but, as they
lie flat on the muzzle, they do not form whi&s;|kers.
The tongue is narrow and long, and the
animal often thru&s;ts it three or four inches out
of his mouth. The tail is of one uniform co|lour,
and gradually tapers to a point: It is
bended upwards when the animal walks, and
has the prehen&s;ile faculty. The length of
<PB N="294" REF="351">
the creature is about fifteen inches, and that
of the tail &s;eventeen.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;This animal was taken in the mountains of
Jamaica. He is mild, and may be handled
without danger. He is drow&s;y during the
day, and extremely vivacious in the night. He
differs much from every other quadruped. His
tongue is not &s;o rough as that of the cat, or
other animals of the <HI>viverra</HI> genus, to which
he is related by the form of the head and claws.
Round his mouth are many curled, &s;oft hairs,
from two to three inches long. The ears are
&s;ituated nearly oppo&s;ite to the eyes. When he
&s;leeps, he rolls him&s;elf up into a ball, like the
hedgehog, with his fore feet under his cheeks.
With his tail, he can draw a weight equal to
that of his own body.&endq;</P>
<P>From comparing the two figures, and the de|&s;criptions
of Mr Colin&s;on and of M. Simon
Chauveau, it is evident, that they both relate to
the &s;ame animal, except &s;ome &s;light varieties,
which change not the &s;pecies.

derived the name <HI>coa&s;e.</HI> It is about &s;ixteen in|ches
long, including the head and body. The
legs are &s;hort, the muzzle thin, and the ears
&s;mall. The hair is of a deep brown colour, and
the claws are black and &s;harp. It lives in the
holes and clefts of rocks, where the female brings
forth her young. It feeds upon beetles, worms,
and &s;mall birds; and, when it gets admi&s;&s;ion to
the court-yards, it de&s;troys the poultry, of which
it only eats the brain. When afraid or irrita|ted,
it emits an odour &s;o abominable, that nei|ther
men nor dogs dare approach. Its urine,
which apparently mingles with this pe&s;tiferous
odour, &s;tains and infects in an indelible manner.
It appears, however, that this di&s;agreeable odour
is not con&s;tant: &startq;This animal,&endq; Seba remarks,
&startq;was &s;ent me alive from Surinam; and I kept
it during a whole &s;ummer in my garden,
where it was &s;ecured by a &s;mall chain. It ne|ver
<PB N="300" REF="361">
bit any per&s;on; and when it was pre&s;ented
with food, it allowed it&s;elf to be handled like a
&s;mall dog. It dug the earth with its &s;nout and
fore feet, which were armed with long crooked
claws. During the day, it concealed it&s;elf in a
kind of den which it had made. It came out
in the night, and, after trimming it&s;elf, it be|gan
to run about, from right to left, as far as
its chain would permit; and this exerci&s;e it
continued till morning. It &s;earched every
where with its no&s;e on the ground. It was
&s;erved with victuals every night, and never took
any food but what was agreeable to its nature.
It was not fond of fle&s;h, bread, and &s;everal o|ther
kinds of nouri&s;hment. Maybugs, boiled
&s;hrimps, caterpillars, and &s;piders, were its chief
delicacies. About the end of autumn, it was
found dead in its hole, being unable to endure
the cold. The hair on the back is of a deep
che&s;nut colour; the ears are &s;hort; the fore|head
is round, and of a brighter colour than
the back; and the belly is yellow. The tail is
of a moderate length, covered with &s;hort brown
hair, and a kind of yellowi&s;h rings were per|ceptible
all round it.&endq;</P>
<P>Though Seba's de&s;cription and figure corre|&s;pond
very well with tho&s;e of Hernandes, it may
be doubted whether they relate to the &s;ame a|nimal;
becau&s;e Seba makes no mention of the

have perceived in the cour&s;e of a whole &s;ummer,
<PB N="301" REF="362">
during which he kept the animal in his gar|den.
But no &s;uch doubt will remain, after we
are informed, that this animal does not &s;end
forth its di&s;agreeable odour, unle&s;s when irritated
or frighted; and that it is often tamed and kept

When a Sa|vage kills any of them, he cuts out the bladder, to prevent their fle&s;h, which is good eating, from being infected with the &s;mell of the urine.

The conepate<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">The Engli&s;h denominate <HI>polecat,</HI> a &s;pecies of animal which is common not only in Pen&s;ylvania, but in &s;everal other more northern and &s;outhern provinces of America.

Some of them have been &s;een, though rarely, almo&s;t entirely white..... This animal brings forth its young in burrows, or in hollow trees: It continues not always on the ground, but mounts upon trees. It is an enemy to birds; for it breaks their eggs and eats their young. When it gets admi&s;&s;ion to a hen-hou&s;e, it makes great havock.... When hunted, ei|ther by men or dogs, he runs as well as he can, or climbs up a tree; and, when hard pu&s;hed, he darts forth his urine a|gain&s;t his pur&s;uers.... The odour of his urine is &s;o &s;trong, that it &s;uffocates. If a drop of this pe&s;tiferous fluid falls upon the eyes, the per&s;on is in danger of lo&s;ing his &s;ight; and, when it falls upon a man's clothes, it is extremely difficult to extract the &s;mell from them. Mo&s;t dogs fly from him the moment they perceive this odour. It requires more than a month to remove the &s;mell from &s;tuffs of any kind.... In the woods, it is often felt at a great di&s;tance. In the year 1749, one of the&s;e animals came near the place where I lodged. It was in winter and during the night. The dogs were wakened, and pur&s;ued it. In a moment, it diffu&s;ed an odour &s;o fetid, that I was almo&s;t &s;uffocated in my bed, and the cows bellowed in a hideous manner.... About the end of the &s;ame year, another of them &s;lipt into our cave; but it diffu&s;ed not the &s;malle&s;t odour, which it never does, unle&s;s when pur&s;ued or irritated. A woman perceived its eyes &s;parkling in the dark, and killed it. The cave was in&s;tantly filled with &s;uch a noxi|ous odour, that the woman was not only &s;ick for &s;everal days, but the bread, meat, and other provi&s;ions were &s;o infected, that they were obliged to be thrown away; <HI>Kalm's travels, p.</HI> 412.</NOTE>, upon a black

The eyes are long and narrow: The u|vea is black, and all the re&s;t white.

<P>THE Sable is mentioned by almo&s;t every
naturali&s;t, without knowing more of it
than the &s;kin. M. Gmelin is the fir&s;t who gave
a figure and de&s;cription of this animal. He
&s;aw two of them alive in the hou&s;e of the gover|nour
of Tobol&s;ki. &startq;The &s;able,&endq; &s;ays he, &startq;re|&s;embles

body, and the wea&s;el in the teeth. It has &s;ix
cutting teeth pretty long and a little crooked,
and two canine, in the under jaw, and &s;mall
&s;harp teeth in the upper. It has long whi&s;|kers
round the mouth, and large feet, all arm|ed
with five claws. The&s;e characters were
common to both the &s;ables. But the one was
of a blacki&s;h brown colour all over the body,
except the ears, and below the chin, where
the hair was a little yellow. The other was
&s;maller, and of a yellowi&s;h brown colour,
with the ears and under part of the chin of a
paler ca&s;t. The&s;e are their winter colours;
for, in &s;pring, they change by the &s;hading of
the hair. The fir&s;t &s;able, which was of a
blacki&s;h brown, changes into a browni&s;h yel|low
in &s;pring; and the &s;econd, which was of
a yellowi&s;h brown, becomes a pale yellow. I
admired,&endq; continues M. Gmelin, &startq;the agility
of the&s;e animals. Whenever they perceive a
cat, they ri&s;e upon their hind feet, to prepare
for the combat. In the night, they are ex|tremely
re&s;tle&s;s and active<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">This re&s;tle&s;s activity during the night is not peculiar to the &s;able. The &s;ame thing I remarked in two ermines, which I kept for &s;everal months.</NOTE>. During the day,
on the contrary, and particularly after eating,
they generally &s;leep half an hour or an hour,
when they may be pu&s;hed, &s;haken, and even
pricked, without awaking.&endq; From this de|&s;cription
we learn, that the &s;ables are not all of

character; for their colour not only va|ries
in different &s;ea&s;ons, but the individuals of
the &s;ame and of different climates differ from
each other.</P>
<P>The &s;ables inhabit the banks of rivers, and
the thicke&s;t parts of the woods. They leap
with great agility from tree to tree, and avoid
the rays of the &s;un, which are &s;aid, in a &s;hort
time, to change the colour of their hair. It is
pretended, that they conceal them&s;elves, and lie
in a torpid &s;tate during the winter<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Of the two &s;ables mentioned by M. Gmelin, the fir&s;t came from the province of Tom&s;kien, and the &s;econd from that of Bere&s;owien.

this is the be&s;t &s;ea&s;on for hunting them, becau&s;e
their fur is then better and more beautiful than
in &s;ummer. They live upon rats, fi&s;hes, pine
tops, and wild fruits. They are very ardent
in their amours: During their &s;ea&s;on of love,
they emit a &s;trong odour, and their excrements,
at all times, have a di&s;agreeable &s;mell. They
are chiefly found in Siberia: There are not
<PB N="312" REF="379">
many of them in the fore&s;t of Great Ru&s;&s;ia,
and &s;till fewer in Lapland. The blacke&s;t &s;ables
are mo&s;t e&s;teemed<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">The &s;able differs from the martin by being &s;maller, and having finer and longer hair. The true &s;ables are dama&s;ked with black, and are taken in Tartary. There are few of them in Lapland. The fur is e&s;teemed in proportion to the blackne&s;s of the hair, and &s;ometimes &s;ells at &s;ixty crowns, though the width of the &s;kin exceeds not four inches. Some of them have been &s;een white, and others gray; <HI>Regnard, tom. 1. p.</HI> 176.

<P>The hunting of the &s;bles is carried on by

&s;ometimes, in&s;tead of fire-arms, they u&s;e cro&s;s-bows
and &s;mall arrows. As the &s;ucce&s;s of this
hunting requires much addre&s;s and a&s;&s;iduity, the
officers are allowed to encourage the &s;oldiers,

&startq;The &s;ables live in holes of corrupted trees,
or under their roots, or on rocky eminences.
Their ne&s;ts are con&s;tructed with mo&s;s, branches
of trees, and turf. In the&s;e holes or ne&s;ts,
they continue twelve hours, both in &s;ummer
and winter. The remainder of their time
is occupied in que&s;t of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. In &s;pring,
they feed upon wea&s;els, ermines, &s;quirrels,
and e&s;pecially hares. But, in the fruit &s;ea|&s;on,
they eat bay-berries, and the fruit of the
&s;ervice-tree. In winter, they catch &s;mall birds
and woodcocks. When the &s;now falls, they
retire to their holes, where they remain &s;ome|times
three weeks. They copulate in the
month of January. Their amours continue
one month, and often produce bloody combats
between the males. After copulation, they
remain in their ne&s;ts about fifteen days. The
females bring forth about the end of March,
and produce from three to five young, whom
they &s;uckle four or &s;ix months.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;The hunters go, in companies of forty, in
que&s;t of the&s;e animals during the winter only,
and u&s;e canoes, with provi&s;ions for three or
four months. They have a chief, who, when
they arrive at the rendezvous, a&s;&s;igns to each
band a particular quarter, and all the hunters
are obliged to obey him. The &s;now is re|moved
from the places where the &s;nares are
to be laid; and each hunter prepares twenty
of them daily. The hunters choo&s;e a &s;mall
&s;pot in the vicinity of trees, &s;urround it, to a
<PB N="315" REF="382">
certain height, with &s;harp &s;takes, and cover
it with thin planks, to prevent the entrance of
the &s;now. They leave a narrow pa&s;&s;age, above
which is placed a beam, &s;upported only by a
&s;mall twig; and, as &s;oon as the &s;able touches
it, to carry off the piece of fle&s;h or fi&s;h, put
there for a bait, the beam falls and kills the
animal. All the &s;ables are brought to the
general conductor; or, rather, they are con|cealed
in the holes of trees, to prevent the
Tongu&s;ians, or other &s;avage people, from
&s;tealing them. When the &s;ables are aver&s;e
to enter the&s;e &s;nares, the hunters have re|cour&s;e
to nets. When a hunters di&s;covers
the track of a &s;able, he follows it till he di&s;|covers
its hole, and, by means of &s;moke, o|bliges
the animal to come out. He then
extends his net; and continues lying in wait,
in this manner, with his dogs, for two or
three days &s;ucce&s;&s;ively. This net is thirteen
fathoms long, and four or five in height.
When the &s;able leaves its hole, it &s;eldom
e&s;capes; for the dogs &s;lay it when entangled
by the net. When di&s;covered on the trees,
the hunter &s;hoots them with blunt arrows.
to prevent the &s;kins from being injured. The
hunting being fini&s;hed, the company a&s;&s;emble

it, is borrowed from this author. But
Wormius, after the mo&s;t accurate re&s;earches,
<PB N="317" REF="384">
has written a hi&s;tory of this animal, which he
de&s;cribes in the following manner: &startq;It has,&endq; he
remarks, &startq;the figure of a mou&s;e; but the tail
is &s;horter, and the body about five inches long.
The hair is fine, and &s;potted with various co|lours.
The fore part of the head is black,
and the hind part yellowi&s;h. The neck and
&s;houlders are black. The re&s;t of the body is
reddi&s;h, and marked with &s;mall black &s;pots of
different figures, as far as the tail, which ex|ceeds
not half an inch in length, and is cover|ed
with blacki&s;h yellow hairs. Neither the
figure, nor the order of the &s;pots, are the &s;ame
in every individual. Round the mouth there
are &s;everal &s;tiff hairs in the form of whi&s;kers,
of which &s;ix on each &s;ide are longer and &s;tiffer
than the re&s;t. The opening of the mouth is
&s;mall, and the upper lip is divided, as in the
&s;quirrels. From the upper jaw proceed two
long, &s;harp, and &s;omewhat crooked cutting
teeth, the roots of which penetrate as far as
the orbits of the eyes. Two &s;imilar teeth in
the under jaw corre&s;pond with tho&s;e above;
and there are three grinders on each &s;ide, &s;itu|ated
at a di&s;tance from the cutting teeth. The
fir&s;t of the grinders is large, and compo&s;ed of
four lobes, the &s;econd of three lobes, and the
third is much &s;maller. Each of the&s;e three
teeth has a &s;eparate &s;ocket, and they are placed in
the palate, at a con&s;iderable di&s;tance from one
another. The tongue is pretty large, and ex|tends
<PB N="318" REF="385">
to the extremity of the cutting teeth.
From the remains of herbs and &s;traw found
in its throat, we are inclined to think that it
is a ruminating animal. The eyes are &s;mall
and black, and the ears recline on the back.
The forelegs are very &s;hort, and the feet covered
with hair, and armed with five &s;harp, crooked
claws; the middle one is very long, and the
fifth is like a &s;mall thumb, or a cock's &s;pur,
and &s;ometimes &s;ituated equally high on the
leg. The whole belly is whiti&s;h, inclined to
yellow,&endq; &amp;c.</P>
<P>The&s;e animals, though their body is thick,
and their legs very &s;hort, fail not to run pretty
quickly. They generally inhabit the mountains
of Norway and Lapland; but, in particular
years, they &s;ometimes de&s;cend in &s;uch numbers<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">It has been remarked, that the lemmers appear not re|gularly every year, but at certain unfore&s;een periods, and in &s;uch numbers, that they &s;pread every where, and cover the whole &s;urface of the earth....

Gra&s;s that has been eat down, and &s;prings again, is &s;aid to kill them; and they &s;eem likewi&s;e to commit &s;uicide; for they are often found &s;u&s;pended on the branches of trees; and they probably throw them&s;elves, in troops, into the waters, like the &s;wal|lows; <HI>Hi&s;t. de la Lapponie, par Schoeffer, p. 322.

in the fields, lay wa&s;te the gardens, ruin
the crops, and leave nothing, except what is
&s;hut up in hou&s;es, where they happily never en|ter.
They bark nearly like &s;mall dogs. When
&s;truck at with a &s;tick, they &s;eize it &s;o forcibly
with their teeth, that they allow them&s;elves to
be carried to a con&s;iderable di&s;tance without
quitting their hold. They dig holes in the earth,
and make roads, like the moles, in que&s;t of
roots. At particular times, they a&s;&s;emble to|gether,
and the whole die in company. They
are very courageous, and defend them&s;elves a|gain&s;t
other animals. It is not known from

<P>&startq;THE <HI>&s;aricovienne,</HI>&endq; (or &s;ea otter), &s;ays The|vet,
&startq;is found along the river Plata.
It is of an amphibious nature, living more in
<PB N="322" REF="389">
the water than upon land. This animal is as
large as a cat; and its &s;kin, which is a mix|ture
of gray and black, is as fine as velvet.
Its feet re&s;emble tho&s;e of water-fowl; and its
fle&s;h is extremely good and delicate<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Singularit&eacute;s de la France antarctique, par Thevet, p. 107.</NOTE>.&endq; I be|gin
with the above pa&s;&s;age, becau&s;e the animal
is unknown to the naturali&s;ts under this name,
and becau&s;e they know not that the <HI>carigueibeju</HI>
of Bra&s;il, which is the &s;ame, has membranes
between the toes. Marcgrave, indeed, who
gives a de&s;cription of it, mentions not this cha|racter,
which is an e&s;&s;ential one, &s;ince it brings
this &s;pecies as near as po&s;&s;ible to that of the
otter.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, I believe that the animal mentioned
by Gumilla, under the name of <HI>Guachi</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">On the rivers which fall into the Oronoko, there are a great many water dogs, which the Indians call <HI>Guachi.</HI> This animal &s;wims &s;wiftly, and feeds upon fi&s;hes. It is am|phibious; but goes likewi&s;e in que&s;t of food upon the land. It digs ditches on the banks, where the female brings forth her young. The&s;e ditches are not made in retired places, but where the animals live in common, and come to amu&s;e them&s;elves. I carefully examined their habitations, and found them to be always exceedingly clean. They leave not the &s;malle&s;t herb in the neighbourhood. They heap up, at a di&s;tance, the fragments of the fi&s;hes they eat, and, by leap|ing, going, and returning, they make their roads extremely neat and commodious; <HI>Hi&s;t. de l'Orenoque, par Gumilla, tom. 3. p. 29.

be the &s;ame with the &s;aricovienne, which is a
&s;pecies of otter common throughout all South
America. From the de&s;cription given of it by
Marcgrave and De&s;marchais<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Voyage de De&s;marchais, tom. 3. p. 306.</NOTE>, it appears, that
this amphibious animal is as large as a middle
&s;ized dog; that the top of its head is round like
that of the cat; that its muzzle is &s;omewhat
long, like that of the dog; that it has the teeth
and whi&s;kers of a cat; &s;mall, round, black eyes;
ears roundi&s;h, and placed low; five toes on each
foot, with the thumbs &s;horter than the other
toes, which are all armed with &s;harp brown
claws. The tail is as long as the hind legs.
The hair is pretty &s;hort and very &s;oft. It is
black on the body, and brown on the head, with
a white &s;pot under the chin. Its cry is nearly
like that of a young dog; and it is &s;ometimes
interrupted by another cry &s;imilar to that of the
&s;agoin, or fox-tailed monkey. It feeds upon
crabs and fi&s;hes; but it may likewi&s;e be nouri&s;h|ed
with the flour of manioc diluted in water.
Its &s;kin makes a good fur; and, though it lives
chiefly on fi&s;hes, its fle&s;h is very good, whole|&s;ome,
and has no bad flavour.</P>

<HEAD>The CANADIAN OTTER.</HEAD>
<P>THIS otter, which is much larger than
ours, and ought to be found in the north
of Europe, as well as in Canada, affords me an
opportunity of inquiring whether it is the &s;ame
animal with the <HI>latax</HI> of Ari&s;totle, which, he re|marks,
is much larger and &s;tronger than the
common otter. But the ideas he gives of it
corre&s;pond not entirely with this large otter; and,
finding that it was perfectly &s;imilar to the com|mon
otter, except in &s;ize, I thought it was not a
particular &s;pecies, but a &s;imple variety: And, as
the Greeks, and e&s;pecially Ari&s;totle, were care|ful
not to give different names but to di&s;tinct
&s;pecies, we are per&s;uaded, that the <HI>latax</HI> is an|other
animal. Be&s;ides, as the otters, like the bea|vers,
are generally larger, and have finer and
blacker hair in America<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">The otters of North America differ from tho&s;e of France by being commonly longer and blacker. They are of diffe|rent &s;hades, and &s;ome of them are as black as jet; and tho&s;e la&s;t are deare&s;t and in greate&s;t reque&s;t; <HI>De&s;cript. de l'Amerique Seplent. par Dennis, tom. 2. p.</HI> 280.</NOTE> than in Europe, this
otter of Canada ought to be longer and blacker
than the French otter. But, on con&s;idering
what the <HI>latax</HI> of Ari&s;totle might be, I conjec|tured
that it was the animal mentioned by Be|lon,
<PB N="325" REF="392">
under the name of the <HI>&s;ea-wolf.</HI> I &s;hall,
therefore, relate what Ari&s;totle has &s;aid of the

But as this animal (he remarks) lives on|ly on fi&s;hes, and was unknown to the antients, it &s;eems to be no le&s;s &s;ingular than the double lived animals mentioned a|bove; for which rea&s;on, I have given a figure of it;&endq; <HI>Belon de la Nature des Poi&s;&s;ons, p. 18.

<P>In this pa&s;&s;age, Ari&s;totle mentions &s;ix amphi|bious
animals; and, of the&s;e &s;ix, we know only
three, the common &s;eal, the beaver, and the ot|ter.
The other three, namely, the <HI>latax,</HI> the
<HI>&s;atherion,</HI> and the <HI>&s;atyrion,</HI> remain unknown, be|cau&s;e
they are only pointed out by their names,
without any de&s;cription. In this ca&s;e, as in all
tho&s;e where no direct induction can be derived
<PB N="326" REF="393">
from a knowledge of the object, we mu&s;t have
recour&s;e to the mode of exclu&s;ion; but this mode
can never be employed with &s;ucce&s;s, except when
we know nearly the whole &s;ubject. For ex|ample,
from long &s;tudy, I believe that I am ac|quainted
with nearly the whole quadruped tribe.
I know that Ari&s;totle could have no information
concerning tho&s;e which are peculiar to the Con|tinent
of America. Of the quadrupeds, I like|wi&s;e
know all tho&s;e which are amphibious: From
the&s;e I, in the fir&s;t place, &s;trike off all tho&s;e
which belong to America, as the tapir, the ca|biai,
the ondatra, or mu&s;k-rat, &amp;c. There re|main
only the amphibious animals of our own
Continent, which are, the hippopotamus, the
walrus or &s;ea-cow, the &s;eals or &s;ea-calves, the
&s;ea-wolf of Belon, the beaver, the otter, the &s;able,
the water-rat, the Mu&s;covy mu&s;k-rat, the wa|ter
&s;hrew-mou&s;e, and, if you choo&s;e, the ichneu|mon,
which &s;ome authors have regarded as an
amphibious animal, and called it the <HI>Egyptian
otter.</HI> From this number, I retrench the wal|rus
or &s;ea-cow, which, being found only in the
northern &s;eas, was unknown to Ari&s;totle. I
likewi&s;e retrench the hippopotamus, the water-rat,
and the ichneumon, becau&s;e he mentions
them el&s;ewhere under their proper names. La&s;t|ly,
I retrench the &s;eals, the beaver, and the ot|ter,
which are well known, and the water &s;hrew
mou&s;e, which is too &s;imilar to the land one to
have ever received a &s;eparate name. There re|main,
<PB N="327" REF="394">
then, the &s;ea-wolf of Belon, the &s;able, and
the Mu&s;covy mu&s;k-rat, for the <HI>latax,</HI> the <HI>&s;athe|rion,</HI>
and the <HI>&s;atyrion.</HI> Of the&s;e three animals,
the &s;ea-wolf of Belon alone is larger than the
otter: Hence it alone can repre&s;ent the <HI>latax;</HI>
and, con&s;equently, the &s;able and the Mu&s;covy
mu&s;k-rat mu&s;t repre&s;ent the <HI>&s;atherion</HI> and the
<HI>&s;atyrion.</HI> The&s;e conjectures, which I believe to
be well founded, are not, however, of the num|ber
of tho&s;e which time can elucidate, unle&s;s

<P>LET us a&s;&s;emble, for a moment, all the

the quadrupeds than to the cetaceous animals; be|cau&s;e
they have a kind of four feet. But the manati,
who have only two fore-feet re&s;emble the ceta|ceous
tribes more than the quadrupeds. Both

without re&s;piration, clo&s;es the moment after

though the mothers bring forth their young on
land, and re&s;piration commences immediately
after birth, as in all other animals. By means
of this perpetual aperture in the <HI>&s;eptum</HI> or par|tition
of the heart, which allows a communica|tion
of the blood from the vena cava to the a|orta,
the&s;e animals enjoy the privilege of re&s;pi|ring,

power is common to the whole of them: But

&s;everal varieties. We have &s;een one which &s;eem|ed
to differ in the proportions of its body from
the common kind; for its neck was &s;horter, its
body longer, and its claws larger. But the&s;e
differences are not &s;ufficient to con&s;titute a di|&s;tinct
&s;pecies. The &s;econd is the &s;eal of the Me|diterranean
and &s;outhern &s;eas, which we pre&s;ume
to be the <HI>phoca</HI> of the antients, and a di&s;tinct
&s;pecies; for it differs from the others by the
quality of its hair, which is flowing and almo&s;t
black, while that of the common kind is gray
and coar&s;e. It differs &s;till more in the form of
the teeth and ears; for it has a kind of &s;mall ex|ternal

The&s;e di&s;crepances, however, are perhaps only

<P>It was from a conformity which, at fir&s;t view,
might appear &s;light, joined to &s;ome fugitive re|lations,
that we judged this &s;econd or little &s;eal
to be the phoca of the antients. We have been
a&s;&s;ured, that the individual in our po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion was
brought from India; and it is very probable that
it came from the Levant. It was an adult; for it
wanted no teeth. Its &s;ize was at lea&s;t a fifth part
le&s;s than that of the full grown &s;eals in our &s;eas,
and two-thirds le&s;s than tho&s;e in the frozen &s;ea;
for it exceeded not two feet three inches in length,
<PB N="339" REF="407">
while that de&s;cribed by Mr Par&s;ons, though not
an adult, as it wanted &s;everal teeth, was &s;even
feet and a half. Now, the characters which
the antients a&s;cribe to their <HI>phoca</HI> corre&s;pond
not with an animal of &s;uch magnitude, but ap|ply
to this &s;mall &s;eal, which they frequently
compare to the beaver and otter, animals that
never can be compared with the large &s;eals of
the north. There is another relation, which,
though fal&s;e in its object, could never be attribu|ted
to our &s;eals, or to tho&s;e of the northern &s;eas.
The antients, when treating of the <HI>phoca,</HI> tell
us, that its hair waves, and, from a natural &s;ym|pathy,
follows the motions of the &s;ea; that it
lies backward when the tide ebbs, and forward
when it flows<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Pelles eorum etiam detractas corpori &s;en&s;um aequorum retinere tradunt, &s;emper ae&s;tu maris recedente inhorre&s;cere; <HI>Plin. hi&s;t. nat. lib. 9. cap.</HI> 13.&mdash;Severinus a&s;&s;erts, that he &s;aw this wonderful appearance; but he expre&s;&s;es it with &s;uch ex|aggeration as de&s;troys its credibility.

continues long after the &s;kin has been &s;eparated
from the animal. Now, this quality could ne|ver
have been imagined with regard to our &s;eals
or tho&s;e of the north; becau&s;e the hair of both
is &s;hort and &s;tiff. But it agrees, in &s;ome mea|&s;ure,
with the &s;mall &s;eal, who&s;e hair is waving,
and much longer and &s;uppler than that of the
other kinds. In general, &s;eals of the &s;outhern

Be&s;ides, Cardan affirms po&s;itively<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Carden de &s;ubtilitate, lib. 10.</NOTE>,
that this quality, which had been con&s;idered as
fabulous, is found to be real in the Indies.
Without giving more faith to Cardan's a&s;&s;ertion
than it de&s;erves, it at lea&s;t &s;hows, that this qua|lity
is peculiar to the Indian &s;eal. Perhaps the
appearance, if it exi&s;ts, is electrical; and both
antients and moderns, being ignorant of the
cau&s;e, have a&s;cribed the effect to the ebbing and
flowing of the &s;ea. But, however this matter
&s;tands, the rea&s;ons already given are &s;ufficient
to found a pre&s;umption that the &s;mall &s;eal is the

From what has been remarked, it appears,
that there are three di&s;tinct &s;pecies of the &s;eal:
The &s;mall black &s;eal of India and the Levant,
the common &s;eal of our &s;eas, and the large &s;eal
of the northern ocean. To the fir&s;t of which,
all that the antients have written concerning the
<HI>phoca</HI> mu&s;t be referred. Ari&s;totle knew this a|nimal;
for he tells us, that it is of an ambigu|ous
nature, an intermediate creature between a|quatic
and terre&s;trial animals; that it is an im|perfect
quadruped; that it has no external ears,
but only two con&s;picuous auditory pa&s;&s;ages;
and that it has a forked tongue, paps for &s;uck|ling,
and a &s;mall tail like that of the &s;tag. But
he &s;eems to have been deceived when he &s;ays,
that this animal has no gall-bladder. Mr Par|&s;ons,
indeed, acknowledges, that the gall-blad|der
of the larger &s;eal he has de&s;cribed was very
&s;mall. M. Daubenton, however, found, in our
&s;eal, which he di&s;&s;ected, that the gall-bladder was
proportioned to the &s;ize of the liver; and the
<PB N="343" REF="411">
Gentlemen of the Academy found a gall-blad|der
in the &s;eal they de&s;cribe; but mention not
that it was remarkable &s;mall.</P>
<P>Ari&s;totle, be&s;ides, could have no knowledge of
the large &s;eals produced in the frozen &s;ea; be|cau&s;e,
in his time, the whole north of Europe
and of A&s;ia were entirely unknown. The Greeks,
and even the Romans, regarded France and Ger|many
as their north. The Greeks, particularly,
knew none of the animals peculiar to the&s;e coun|tries.
Hence Ari&s;totle, who mentions the <HI>phoca</HI>
as a common animal, can mean nothing el&s;e than
the Mediterranean &s;eal.</P>
<P>The&s;e three animals, though different in &s;pe|cies,
have many common properties, and ought
to be regarded as of the &s;ame nature. The fe|males
bring forth in winter, and place their young
upon a bank of &s;and, a rock, or a &s;mall i&s;land.
They &s;it on their hind legs<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">The &s;eals have two &s;ins on each &s;ide the rump, which &s;erve in&s;tead of a tail in the &s;ea; and, on land, they &s;it on them, when they give &s;uck to their young; <HI>Dampier, vol. 1. p.</HI> 82.</NOTE>, to allow their young
to &s;uck; and they continue to nouri&s;h them in
this manner during twelve or fifteen days, with|out
removing them from the place of their birth.
After which the mother carries them to the &s;ea,
and learns them to &s;wim and to &s;earch for food.
When fatigued, &s;he places them on her back.
As every litter con&s;i&s;ts only of two or three, her
cares are not much divided, and their education
<PB N="344" REF="412">
is &s;oon completed. Be&s;ides, nature has be&s;tow|ed
on the&s;e animals uncommon &s;agacity and &s;en|timent.
When a&s;&s;i&s;tance is nece&s;&s;ary, they un|der&s;tand
and mutually aid one another. The
young know their mother in the mid&s;t of a nu|merous
troop. They di&s;tingui&s;h her voice, and,
when &s;he calls, they never fail to come<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Dampier, vol. 1. p. 89.</NOTE>. We
know not the period of ge&s;tation; but, if we
judge of it from that of the growth, the duration
of life, and the magnitude of the animal, it mu&s;t
be &s;everal months: It is &s;ome years before they
acquire their full growth, and the duration of
their life mu&s;t be proportionally long. I am
even inclined to believe that they live longer than
is generally imagined, perhaps above a hundred
years; for the cetaceous animals live much long|er
than the quadrupeds; and, as the &s;eal is the
intermediate link between both, it ought to par|take
of the nature of the former, and, of cour&s;e,
enjoy life longer than the latter.</P>
<P>The voice of the &s;eal has been compared to
the barking of a hoar&s;e dog: When young, it
is clearer, and re&s;embles the mewing of a cat.
The young, when carried off from the mother,
mew continually, and &s;ometimes die of hunger
rather than take the food that is offered to them.
The old &s;eals bark at tho&s;e who &s;trike them, and
u&s;e every effort to bite and avenge them&s;elves.
In general, they are not very timid, and even
&s;how marks of courage. In&s;tead of being afraid

amu&s;e them&s;elves with the &s;torm, and to receive
the rain, of which they are exceedingly fond.
They have naturally a di&s;agreeable &s;mell, which
is felt at a great di&s;tance, when numbers of them

frequently void their excrements, which are yel|low,

This animal abounds on the Magellanic coa&s;ts,
and at the i&s;land of Juan Fernandez in the South
Sea. The&s;e &s;ea lions re&s;emble the &s;eal, which is
likewi&s;e very common in the &s;ame latitudes;
but they are much larger. When they have ac|quired
their full growth, they are from eleven to
eighteen feet long, and from &s;even or eight to
eleven feet in circumference. They are &s;o fat,
that, after piercing the &s;kin, which is an inch
thick, there is at lea&s;t a foot of blubber, before
arriving at the fle&s;h: One of them will yield five
hundred pints of oil. They are, at the &s;ame
time, very full of blood, which &s;prings with
great force when the animal is deeply wounded.
Upon cutting the throat of an individual, two
hog&s;heads of blood were collected, be&s;ides what
remained in the ve&s;&s;els of the body. Their &s;kin
is covered with &s;hort hair, of a clear tawny co|lour;
but their tail and feet are blacki&s;h. Their
<PB N="349" REF="417">
toes are united by a membrane, which extends
not to their extremity, and each of them is ter|minated
by a claw. They differ from the com|mon
&s;eals, not only in magnitude, but in other
characters. The males have a kind of large
cre&s;t, or trunk, which hangs from the end of the
upper jaw to the length of five or &s;ix inches.
This part is wanting in the females, which, be|&s;ide
their being much &s;maller, at once di&s;tin|gui&s;hes
them from the males. Each male car|ries
about with him a troop of females, and al|lows
no other male to approach. The&s;e animals
are truly amphibious. They pa&s;s the &s;ummer
in the &s;ea, and the winter upon land. In this
la&s;t &s;ea&s;on, the females bring forth, and produce
but one or two at a time, which they &s;uckle. A
new born &s;ea lion is as large as a full grown
common &s;eal.</P>
<P>During all the time the &s;ea lions are upon
land, they feed upon the herbage which grows
on the banks of running waters. When not
pa&s;turing, they &s;leep in the mire. They are
very indolent; and it is difficult to waken them:
But they have the precaution of &s;tationing males
as &s;entinels round the places where they &s;leep;
and tho&s;e &s;entinels are &s;aid to give warning when
danger approaches. Their cries are loud and of
various tones. Sometimes they grunt like hogs,
and &s;ometimes &s;nort like hor&s;es. The males of|ten
quarrel about the females, and inflict dread|ful
wounds with their teeth. The fle&s;h of the&s;e
<PB N="350" REF="418">
animals is tolerable food; the tongue, par|ticularly,
is equally good with that of an ox. It
is very ea&s;y to kill them; for they can neither
fly nor defend them&s;elves. They are &s;o un|wieldy,
that they can hardly move or turn them|&s;elves.
A per&s;on has only to take care not to
come too near their teeth, which are very &s;trong,
and with which they inflict mortal wounds.<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">An&s;on's voyage round the world.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>From other ob&s;ervations, compared with the
former, and from &s;ome conclu&s;ions to be dedu|ced
from them, it appears that the&s;e &s;ea lions,
which are found in the &s;outhern point of Ame|rica,
appear again, with little variety, on the
northern coa&s;ts of the &s;ame Continent. The large
&s;eals of Canada, mentioned by Denis under the
denomination of <HI>&s;ea wolves,</HI> and which he di|&s;tingui&s;hes
from the common &s;eals, may be of
the &s;ame &s;pecies with the &s;ea lions. Their young,
this author remarks, when brought forth, are
thicker and longer than the large&s;t hog. Now,
it is certain, that the &s;eals of our ocean, though
full grown, are never of this &s;ize. The Medi|terranean
&s;eal, or the <HI>phoca</HI> of the antients, is
&s;till le&s;s. There remain only the &s;eals de&s;cribed
by Par&s;ons, who&s;e magnitude corre&s;ponds with
tho&s;e of Denis<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">To the te&s;timony of Denis, we may &s;till add that of P. Chr. Leclerg: &startq;Upon the coa&s;ts of North America, there are &s;ea wolves, &s;ome of which are as large as hor&s;es and oxen. The&s;e &s;ea wolves are called <HI>Oua&s;pous;'&endq; Relation de la Ga&s;pe&s;ie, p.</HI> 490.</NOTE>. Par&s;ons does not mention the
<PB N="351" REF="419">
&s;ea where this large &s;eal was found. But, whe|ther
it came from the North of Europe or from
America, it might be the &s;ame with the &s;ea
wolf of Denis, and the &s;ea lion of An&s;on; be|cau&s;e
its &s;ize is the &s;ame, &s;ince, though it had
not nearly acquired its full growth, it was &s;even
feet long. Be&s;ides, the mo&s;t remarkable differ|ence,
next to that of magnitude, between the
&s;ea lion and the &s;eal, is a large cre&s;t which the
male of the former has upon the upper jaw; but
the female has no &s;uch cre&s;t. Par&s;ons did not
&s;ee the male. He de&s;cribed the female only,
which had no cre&s;t, and perfectly re&s;em|bled
the female &s;ea lion of An&s;on. To the&s;e
&s;imilarities, Par&s;ons adds another, which is &s;till
more remarkable: He tells us, that his &s;eal had
the &s;tomachs and inte&s;tines of a cow; and, at
the &s;ame time, the author of An&s;on's voyages
&s;ays, that the &s;ea lion feeds upon herbage during
the whole &s;ummer. Hence it is extremely pro|bable,
that the &s;tructure of the&s;e two animals is
the &s;ame, or rather that they are the &s;ame ani|mals,
and very different from the other &s;eals,
who have but one &s;tomach, and feed upon fi&s;hes.</P>
<P>Woods Rogers had mentioned, before the au|thor
of An&s;on's voyage, the&s;e &s;ea lions on the
coa&s;ts of South America, and de&s;cribes them a
little differently: &startq;The &s;ea lion,&endq; he remarks,
is a very &s;trange creature, and of a prodigious
&s;ize. I have &s;een &s;ome of them above twenty
feet long, and could not weigh le&s;s than four
thou&s;and pounds. Others were &s;ixteen feet
<PB N="352" REF="420">
in length, and might weigh about two thou|&s;and
pounds. The quantity of oil they yield|ed
was amazing. The figure of their body
approaches to that of the &s;ea calf; but their
&s;kin is thicker than that of an ox. The hair
is &s;hort and coar&s;e, the head di&s;proportionally
large, and the mouth remarkably big: The
eyes are of a mon&s;trous &s;ize. The muzzle re|&s;embles
that of a lion, with terrible whi&s;kers,
the hairs of which are &s;o &s;tiff that they may
&s;erve for tooth-picks. About the end of the
month of June, the&s;e animals repair to the
i&s;land of Juan Fernandez, in order to produce
their young, which they depo&s;it about a gun|&s;hot
from the margin of the &s;ea. There they
remain till the end of September, without mo|ving
out of the place, and without taking any
nouri&s;hment; at lea&s;t, we never &s;aw them eat.
I ob&s;erved &s;ome of them continue eight days
in the &s;ame &s;pot, and would not have aban|doned
it, if we had not frighted them.....
At the i&s;land of Lobos, on the coa&s;t of Peru,
we &s;aw &s;ome &s;ea lions, and a greater number
of &s;eals<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Voyage round the world by Woods Rogers.</NOTE>.&endq;</P>
<P>The&s;e ob&s;ervations of Woods Rogers, which
corre&s;pond very well with tho&s;e of the author
of An&s;on's voyage, &s;eem &s;till farther to prove,
that the &s;ea lions feed upon herbage when they
are on land; for it is by no means probable, that
they pa&s;s three months without taking any nou|ri&s;hment,
e&s;pecially when &s;uckling their young.
<PB N="353" REF="421">
In the collection of voyages to the South Sea,
there are many remarks concerning the&s;e ani|mals:
But neither the facts nor de&s;criptions ap|pear
to be exact. For example, it is &s;aid, that,
in Magellan's &s;traits<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Navigation aux Terres Au&s;trales, tom. 1. p. 168.</NOTE>, there are &s;ea wolves &s;o
large, that their &s;kin, when extended, was thirty-&s;ix
feet wide; which is unque&s;tionably an ex|aggeration.
We are al&s;o told, that, in the two
i&s;lands of Port De&s;ire, the&s;e animals re&s;emble
lions in the anterior part of their body, having
the head, neck, and &s;houlders garni&s;hed with a
very long bu&s;hy mane<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Idem, tom. 1. p. 221.</NOTE>. This is &s;till a greater
exaggeration; for the &s;ea lions have only a little
more hair on the neck than on the re&s;t of the
body; but this hair exceeds not an inch in
length<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;t. du Paraguay, par le P. Charlevoix, tom. 6 p. 181.</NOTE>. It is farther remarked, that &s;ome of
the&s;e animals are more than eighteen feet long;
that many of them are only fourteen feet; and
that, generally, they exceed not five<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Navigations aux Terres Au&s;trales, tom 2. p. 11.</NOTE>. This
account would lead us to believe that there are
two &s;pecies, the one much larger than the other;
becau&s;e the author does not inform us whether
this difference was owing to the difference of
their ages, which, however, was nece&s;&s;ary to
prevent error. &startq;The&s;e animals,&endq; &s;ays Coreal<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Voyage de Coreal, tom. 2. p. 180.</NOTE>,
keep their mouths always open: Two men
are hardly able to kill one of them with a
<PB N="354" REF="422">
&s;pear, which is the be&s;t weapon to u&s;e again&s;t
them. The female &s;uckles four or five young,
and drives away any other young ones which
approach her: From this circum&s;tance I con|cluded
that the females bring forth four or five
at a litter.&endq; This conjecture &s;eems to be well
founded; for the &s;eal de&s;cribed by Mr Par&s;ons
had four paps, &s;ituated in &s;uch a manner as to
form a &s;quare, in the centre of which the navel
is placed. I thought it proper to collect all the
facts relative to the&s;e animals, which are very
little known. It were to be wi&s;hed that &s;ome
&s;en&s;ible traveller would furni&s;h us with a proper
de&s;cription of them, and particularly of their in|ternal
parts, as the &s;tomach, inte&s;tines, &amp;c. for,
if the te&s;timony of voyagers could be relied on,
we would believe that the &s;ea lions belong to
the cla&s;s of ruminating animals; that they have
&s;everal &s;tomachs; and, con&s;equently, that their
&s;pecies is far removed from that of the &s;eal, or
&s;ea calf, which certainly has but one &s;tomach,
and ought to be ranked with the carnivorous
tribes.</P>

no re&s;emblance to a cow. The name <HI>&s;ea ele|phant,</HI>
which others have given it, is better ima|gined,
becau&s;e it is founded on a con&s;picuous
character: The walrus, like the elephant, has
two large ivory tu&s;ks which proceed from the
upper jaw; and its head, if it had a trunk, would
<PB N="356" REF="424">
have a great re&s;emblance to that of the elephant.
The walrus not only wants this in&s;trument,
which &s;erves the elephant for an arm and hand,
but it has not the u&s;e of its arms and legs, which,
as in the &s;eals, are inclo&s;ed within the &s;kin, the
hands and feet being alone free. The body is
long, &s;welled before, narrow behind, and every
where covered with &s;hort hair. The fingers of
the hands and feet are enveloped in a membrane,
and terminated by &s;harp, &s;hort claws. Thick
hairs, in the form of whi&s;kers, &s;urround the
mouth. The tongue is furrowed. It has no
external ears; &s;o that the walrus, if we except
the two large tu&s;ks which change the form of
the head, and the want of cutting teeth both a|bove
and below, re&s;embles the &s;eal in every o|ther
article: It is only much larger and &s;tronger.
The large&s;t &s;eals exceed not &s;even or eight feet.
The walrus is generally twelve; and &s;ome of
them are &s;ixteen feet long, and eight or nine in
circumference. Both animals inhabit the &s;ame
&s;eas, and are almo&s;t always found together.
They have many common habits: They live
equally in water or on land: They both climb
upon boards of ice: They &s;uckle and manage
their young in the &s;ame manner: They live on
the &s;ame food, and a&s;&s;ociate in large troops.
But the &s;pecies of the walrus is not &s;o much
diver&s;ified as that of the &s;eal. Neither does it
&s;tray to &s;uch di&s;tances, but is more attached to
its proper climate; for it is &s;eldom &s;een any
<PB N="357" REF="425">
where but in the northern &s;eas. Hence the an|tients
were acquainted with the &s;eal, but had no
knowledge of the walrus.</P>
<P>This animal is mentioned by mo&s;t voyagers
who have frequented the northern &s;eas of A&s;ia<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">We find the tu&s;ks of the walrus in the environs of No|va Zembla, and in all the i&s;lands, as far as the Oby. They are &s;aid to be frequent about Jeni&s;ki, and they were &s;een for|merly as far as Pja&s;ida. We again meet with them at Scha|lagin&s;koi, and among the Schukt&s;chii, where they are very large.... It is probable that the&s;e animals are very nume|rous from this place to the river Anadir; for all the tu&s;ks &s;old at Jakutzk are brought from Anadir&s;koi. They are likewi&s;e found in Hud&s;on's &s;traits, where they are a Ru&s;&s;ian ell in length, and as thick as a man's arm. Their ivory is equally good with that of the elephant's tu&s;ks; <HI>Voyage du Nord, tom. 6. p.</HI> 7.&mdash;At Jakutzk, I &s;aw &s;ome teeth of the walrus which were a Ru&s;&s;ian ell and a quarter, and others an ell and a half in length. They are commonly broader than thick, and are about four inches wide at the ba&s;e... I never heard, that, in the neighbourhood of Anadir&s;koi, the walrus was hunted or fi&s;hed to procure its teeth, which come there in &s;uch numbers. On the contrary, I was a&s;&s;ured, that the inhabitants found the&s;e teeth on the low &s;hores, detached from the animal; and, con&s;equently, that there was no occa|&s;ion for killing the creatures... I have frequently been a&s;ked, whether the walrus of Anadir&s;koi was a different &s;pecies from that found in the we&s;t pa&s;&s;age of the frozen &s;ea, becau&s;e the teeth brought from the ea&s;t coa&s;t are much larger than tho&s;e which come from the we&s;t... It appears that the walrus of Greenland, and that on the we&s;t of the frozen &s;ea, have no communication with tho&s;e found to the ea&s;t of Kolima, about the point of Schalagin&s;koi, and, &s;till farther, near Anadir&s;koi. Neither do tho&s;e of Hud&s;on's bay &s;eem to join tho&s;e of T&s;chukt&s;chi.... It is univer&s;ally agreed, however, that the walrus of Anadir&s;koi differs neither in &s;ize nor figure from that of Greenland, &amp;c.; <HI>Voyage de Gmelin en Siberie, tom. 3. p. 148.&mdash;Note.</HI> M.

<P>&startq;In Hori&s;ont and Klock bays, the walrus and
&s;eals were formerly very numerous; but few
of them now remain..... During the heat
of &s;ummer, both of them re&s;ort to the neigh|bouring
plains, and are &s;ometimes &s;een in
troops of one or two hundred, particularly the
walrus, who can continue there for &s;everal
days running, till hunger forces him back to
the &s;ea. The&s;e animals have a great re&s;em|blance
to the &s;eal; but they are &s;tronger and
larger. Like the &s;eal, they have five toes or
<PB N="359" REF="427">
pats; but their claws are &s;horter, and their head
thicker, rounder, and &s;tronger. The &s;kin
of the walrus, e&s;pecially about the neck, is an
inch thick, wrinkled, and covered with very
&s;hort hair of various colours. His upper jaw
is armed with two tu&s;ks of half an ell, or an ell,
in length, which are hollow at the root, and
grow larger as the animal advances in years.
They are &s;ometimes ob&s;erved to have but one
tu&s;k, having lo&s;t the other by fighting, or by
age. This ivory is generally clearer than that
of the elephant; becau&s;e it is harder and more
compact. The mouth of the walrus re&s;em|bles
that of an ox, and is garni&s;hed above and
below with hollow, pointed hairs, about the
thickne&s;s of a &s;traw. Above the mouth are
two no&s;trils, through which the&s;e animals
blow the water, like the whale, without, how|ever,
making much noi&s;e. Their eyes are
&s;parkling, red, and inflamed during the heats
of &s;ummer; and, as they cannot then endure
the impre&s;&s;ion made by the &s;alt water on their
eyes, they continue more willingly on the
land in &s;ummer than at any other time....
They are very numerous about Spitzbergen...
They are killed on land with lances... They
are hunted on account of the profit derived
from their teeth and grea&s;e. Their oil is near|ly
as much e&s;teemed as that of the whale.
Their teeth are of more value than the whole
oil they yield. The internal part of the teeth,
<PB N="360" REF="428">
e&s;pecially when large, the &s;ub&s;tance of which
is harder and more compact than that of the
&s;maller ones, is more precious than ivory.
When a pound of the &s;maller kind is &s;old for
a florin, a pound of the large brings three,
four, and often five florins. A middle &s;ized
tooth weighs three pounds.... and an or|dinary
walrus furni&s;hes half a ton of oil.
Hence the whole animal brings thirty-&s;ix
florins, eighteen for the two teeth, and as
much for the oil.... Formerly, va&s;t troops
of the&s;e animals were found on land. But
our ve&s;&s;els, which go annually to the whale
fi&s;hery, have &s;o terrified them, that they have
retired to the mo&s;t &s;eque&s;tered places, and that
tho&s;e who remain never venture upon land in
troops, but continue in the water, or di&s;per&s;ed
among the boards of ice<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">The number of the&s;e animals mu&s;t be greatly reduced, or rather, mo&s;t of them have retired to unknown coa&s;ts; for we find, in the collection of voyages to the north, that, in the year 1704, near Cherry i&s;land, in the latitude of 65 de|grees 45 minutes, the crew of an Engli&s;h ve&s;&s;el fell in with a prodigious number of the&s;e creatures, all lying near each o|ther; that, out of more than a thou&s;and, of which this troop con&s;i&s;ted, the &s;ailors killed only fifteen; but that they found as many teeth as filled a ton&mdash;that, on the 13th of July, they killed a hundred more, of which they carried off only the teeth&mdash;that, in 1706, another Engli&s;h crew killed &s;even or eight hundred in &s;ix hours; in 1708, more than nine hun|dred in &s;even hours; in 1710, eight hundred in a few days; and that a &s;ingle man &s;lew forty with a &s;pear.</NOTE>. When a walrus
is met with upon the ice, or in the water, a
<PB N="361" REF="429">
&s;trong harpoon is darted at him, which not
unfrequently &s;lips upon the thick, hard, &s;kin.
But, when pierced, the animal is dragged with
a cable toward the helm of the boat, is
&s;lain with a &s;trong &s;pear made for the purpo&s;e,
and afterwards brought to the neare&s;t &s;hore,
or to a flat board of ice. He is generally
heavier than an ox. The fi&s;hers begin with
taking off his &s;kin, which, being of no value,
is thrown away<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Zorgdrager &s;eems to have been ignorant that a very good leather is made of this &s;kin. I have &s;een &s;trong coach braces made of it. Ander&s;on, after Other, &s;ays, that girths, and ropes for boats, are al&s;o made of this &s;kin; <HI>Hi&s;t, of Green|land, tom. 2. p.</HI> 160.</NOTE>. With a hatchet, they &s;e|parate
the two teeth from the head; or, to
prevent the teeth from damage, they cut off
the head, and boil it in a cauldron. The
blubber is afterwards cut into long &s;lices, and
carried to the &s;hip.... It is equally difficult
to follow the walrus by rowing as the whale,
and the harpoon is often darted in vain; becau&s;e
the whale is more ea&s;ily pierced, and the har|poon
does not &s;o readily &s;lip... The walrus is
often &s;truck three times with a &s;trong, &s;harp
&s;pear, before his hard, thick &s;kin is pierced.
It is nece&s;&s;ary, therefore, to &s;trike him in a
place where the &s;kin is well &s;tretched. For
this rea&s;on, the fi&s;hers aim at the eyes of the
animal, which obliges it to turn its head, and
<PB N="362" REF="430">
&s;tretch the &s;kin of the throat or brea&s;t. Then
the blow is given in this place, and the &s;pear
is quickly retracted, to prevent the creature
from &s;eizing it with his teeth, and wounding
his a&s;&s;ailant, either with his teeth, or even with
the &s;pear, which &s;ometimes happens. The at|tack
upon a &s;mall board of ice never la&s;ts long;
becau&s;e the walrus, whether wounded or not,
throws him&s;elf quickly into the water; and,
therefore, attacking him upon land is always
preferred.... The&s;e animals are only found
in unfrequented places, as in the i&s;land of
Moffen, behind Worland, in the lands &s;ur|rounding
Hori&s;ont and Klock bays, in retired
plains, and banks of &s;and, where ve&s;&s;els rarely
approach. Even tho&s;e which are there met
with, in&s;tructed by the per&s;ecutions they have
&s;uffered, are &s;o much on their guard, that they
keep always near the water, to facilitate their
retreat. This fact I experienced on the large
bank of &s;and behind Worland, called <HI>Rif,</HI>
where I fell in with a troop of thirty or forty.
Some of them were on the very margin of
the water, and others at no great di&s;tance from
it. We &s;topped &s;ome hours, without landing,
in the hopes that they would advance farther
into the plain. But, as this &s;tratagem did not
&s;ucceed, we landed with two boats to the
right and left of them. Almo&s;t the whole of
them were in the water the moment we put
<PB N="363" REF="431">
our feet on the land; &s;o that our hunting was
confined to the wounding of a few, which
likewi&s;e in&s;tantly darted into the &s;ea......
Before being per&s;ecuted, the&s;e animals advan|ced
far upon land; &s;o that, in high tides, they
were at a great di&s;tance from the water; and,
when the tide ebbed, the di&s;tance being in|crea&s;ed,
they were ea&s;ily a&s;&s;ailed..... We
marched in front of the&s;e animals to cut off
their retreat from the &s;ea. They &s;aw all the&s;e
preparations without betraying any &s;ymptoms
of fear; and each hunter often killed one of
them, before it could regain the water. We
made a barrier of the dead carca&s;&s;es, and left
&s;ome of our men in ambu&s;h to &s;lay tho&s;e
which remained. We &s;ometimes killed three
or four hundred..... From the prodigious
quantity of teeth &s;cattered over the ground,
it is obvious that the&s;e animals mu&s;t have for|merly
been very numerous...... When
wounded, they become furious, &s;triking from
one &s;ide to the other with their teeth. They
break the arms, or drive them out of the
hands of their a&s;&s;ailants; and, at la&s;t, burning
with rage, they place their head between their
paws, or fins, and allow them&s;elves to tumble
into the &s;ea.... When very numerous, they
grow &s;o audacious, that, in order to &s;ecure
one another, they &s;urround the boats, and
endeavour to over&s;et them, by &s;triking or
piercing the planks with their teeth.... In

acquainted with men, was afraid of no ene|my;

which are to be found in the Collection of Voy|ages

His paws, both before and behind, like tho&s;e of the &s;ea calf, have five toes; but the claws are &s;horter. His head is like|wi&s;e larger, rounder, and harder, than that of the &s;ea calf. His &s;kin, e&s;pecially about the neck, is a full inch thick. Some of them are covered with mou&s;e-coloured hair, and others have very little hair. They are generally &s;o infe&s;ted with &s;cabs and excoriations, that one would imagine they had been flayed, e&s;pecially about the joints, where the &s;kin is much wrinkled. In the upper jaw they have two large tu&s;ks, which &s;ometimes exceed two feet in length. The young ones have no tu&s;ks; but they grow as the animals advance in years... The&s;e tu&s;ks are more e&s;teemed than the fine&s;t ivory; they are &s;olid within, but hollow at the roots.. The opening of their mouth is as large as that of an ox; and, both above and be|low the lips, there are &s;everal bri&s;tles, which are hollow with|in; and as thick as a &s;traw...

<PB N="366" REF="434">
are now confined to the &s;eas of the frozen zones;
and, even there, they are very &s;carce in places
which are much frequented. There are few of
them in the frozen &s;eas of Europe, and &s;till
fewer in tho&s;e of Greenland, Davis's &s;traits, and
other parts of North America; becau&s;e, on ac|count
of the whale fi&s;hery, they have been long
di&s;turbed and hunted. From the end of the
&s;ixteenth century, the inhabitants of St Malo
went to the Ram&eacute;e i&s;lands in que&s;t of the wal|ru&s;es,
which were then very numerous<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">De&s;cript. des Indes Occidentales, par de La&euml;t, p. 42.</NOTE>. It

which have &s;ome time ago for&s;aken the&s;e lati|tudes,
as well as tho&s;e of the European &s;eas;
for they are now found in con&s;iderable numbers
only in the frozen &s;ea of A&s;ia, from the mouth

Continent, the coa&s;ts of which are very little
frequented. They are rarely &s;een in the tem|perate
&s;eas. The &s;pecies found under the Tor|rid
Zone, and in the Indian ocean, is very dif|ferent
from our northern walrus. The latter

South pole, though we &s;ee there the large and
&s;mall &s;eals of the North, which are even more
numerous than in our Arctic regions.</P>
<P>The walrus, however, can live at lea&s;t &s;ome
time in a temperate climate. Edward Wor&s;t
tells us, that he &s;aw one of the&s;e animals alive
in England, which was three months old; that
it was put into water, for a &s;hort time only,
each day; and that it crawled upon the ground.
He does not &s;ay that it was incommoded by
the heat of the air, but, on the contrary, that,
when touched, it had the a&s;pect of a furious
and robu&s;t animal, and that it re&s;pired &s;trongly
through the no&s;e. This young walrus was of the
&s;ize of a calf, and had a great re&s;emblance to
the &s;eal. Its head was round, it eyes large, and
its no&s;trils flat and black, which it opened and
&s;hut at plea&s;ure. It had no ears, but only two
auditory pa&s;&s;ages. The opening of the mouth
was not large; and the upper jaw was garni&s;h|ed
with whi&s;kers con&s;i&s;ting of coar&s;e, thick,
cartilaginous hairs. The under jaw was trian|gular,
the tongue thick and &s;hort, and the in&s;ide
of the mouth fortified on each &s;ide with flat
teeth. Both the fore and hind feet were broad,
and the hind part of the body was perfectly &s;i|milar
to that of the &s;eal. This hind part crawl|ed,
rather than walked. The fore feet turned
<PB N="368" REF="436">
forward, and tho&s;e behind backward. They
were all divided into five toes, covered with a
&s;trong membrane...... The &s;kin was thick,
hard, and covered with &s;hort delicate hair, of
an a&s;h-colour. This animal grunted like a wild
boar, and &s;ometimes cried with a &s;trong, deep
voice. It was brought from Nova Zembla, and
had not yet acquired the two large tu&s;ks; but,
on the upper jaw, the knobs from which they
were to &s;pring were vi&s;ible. It was fed with
boiled oats or millet, which it rather &s;lowly
&s;ucked than eat. It &s;prung with fury at its ma|&s;ter,
and made a growling noi&s;e. It followed
him, however, when he pre&s;ented meat to it<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">De&s;cript. des Indes Occidentales, par de La&euml;t, p. 41.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>This account, which gives a tolerably ju&s;t
idea of the walrus, demon&s;trates, at the &s;ame
time, that it can live in a temperate climate.
Neverthele&s;s, it does not appear that it could
endure great heat, or has ever frequented the
&s;outhern &s;eas, &s;o as to pa&s;s from the one pole
to the other. Several voyagers mention &s;ea
cows which they have &s;een in India; but the&s;e
belong to a different &s;pecies: That of the wal|rus
is always ea&s;ily di&s;tingui&s;hed by its long
tu&s;ks, which no other animal has, except the
elephant. This production is an effect rarely
exhibited in Nature; for, of all the terre&s;trial
and amphibious animals, the elephant and wal|rus,
in which alone it appears, are &s;olitary
<PB N="369" REF="437">
&s;pecies, and con&s;titute di&s;tinct and undivided
genera.</P>
<P>We are a&s;&s;ured that the walru&s;es couple not
in the manner of quadrupeds, but backward.
The male, like the whales, has a large bone in
the penis. The females bring forth in winter
upon the land, or upon boards of ice, and ge|nerally
produce but one young at a time, which,
when born, is as large as a hog of an year old.
We are ignorant of the period of ge&s;tation;
but, to judge of it from that of the growth, as
well as the magnitude of the animal, it ought
to be more than nine months. The walru&s;es can|not
remain always in the water; but are obli|ged
to come upon land, either to &s;uckle their
young, or for other purpo&s;es. When under the
nece&s;&s;ity of climbing &s;teep &s;hores, or boards of
ice, they u&s;e their teeth<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">The&s;e teeth are not entirely round and &s;mooth, but ra|ther flat and &s;lightly-furrowed.

to drag along the unwieldy ma&s;s of their bodies.
It is alledged, that they feed upon &s;hell fi&s;hes,
which adhere to the bottom of the &s;ea; and
that they u&s;e their tu&s;ks to di&s;engage them<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Nat. hi&s;t. of Greenland, p. 162.</NOTE>.
Others affirm<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">De&s;cript. des Indes Occidentales, par de La&euml;t, p. 42.</NOTE>, that they live upon a certain
&s;ea-herb with broad leaves, and that they nei|ther
<PB N="370" REF="438">
eat fle&s;h nor fi&s;h. But I believe none of
the&s;e to be true. The walrus, it is probable,
lives upon prey, like the &s;eal, and particularly
on herrings and &s;mall fi&s;hes; for he eats none
upon land, which obliges him to return to the
&s;ea in que&s;t of food.</P>

This character cannot apply to the manati, but agrees very well with the animal under con&s;ideration, of which we have a head.</P></NOTE>.</HEAD>
<P>The dugon is an animal of the African and
Ea&s;t Indian &s;eas, of which we have &s;een two
heads, that have a greater re&s;emblance to that
of the walrus than to any other animal. Its
head is deformed nearly in the &s;ame manner
by the depth of the &s;ockets from which the
two tu&s;ks in the upper jaw &s;pring. They are
half a foot long, and are rather large cut|ting
teeth than tu&s;ks. They extend not direct|ly
<PB N="371" REF="439">
out of the mouth, like tho&s;e of the walrus;
but are much &s;horter and more &s;lender. Be&s;ides,
they are &s;ituated in the fore part of the jaw,
and very near each other, like cutting teeth.
But, between the tu&s;ks of the walrus, there is
a con&s;iderable interval; and they are not &s;ituated
at the point, but at the &s;ide of the upper jaw.
The grinders of the dugon differ likewi&s;e in
number, po&s;ition, and figure, from tho&s;e of the
walrus. From all which we mu&s;t conclude,
that the dugon is a di&s;tinct &s;pecies. Several
voyagers have confounded it with the &s;ea lion.
Innigo de Biervillas &s;ays, that a &s;ea lion was
killed at the Cape of Good Hope, which was
ten feet long, and four thick. Its head re|&s;embled
that of a calf of one year old. Its eyes
were hideous, and its ears &s;hort; and it had a
bri&s;tly beard, broad feet, and legs &s;o &s;hort, that
its belly touched the ground. He adds, that it
had two tu&s;ks which i&s;&s;ued half a foot out of

<HEAD>THE MANATI<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot"><P>The manati has pinniform fore legs; hind parts ending in a tail, horizontally flat. The&s;e animals are of an enormous &s;ize; &s;ome of them are twenty-eight feet long, and eight thou&s;and pounds in weight. The head, in proportion to the bulk of the animal, is &s;mall, oblong, and almo&s;t &s;quare. The no&s;trils are filled with &s;hort bri&s;tles. The gape, or <HI>rictus,</HI> is &s;mall. The lips are double. Near the junction of the two jaws, the mouth is full of white tubular bri&s;tles, which &s;erve the &s;ame u&s;e as the laminae of whales, to prevent the food from running out with the water. The lips are al&s;o full of bri&s;tles, which &s;erve in&s;tead of teeth to cut the &s;trong roots of the &s;ea plants, which, floating a&s;hore, are a &s;ign of the vici|nity of the&s;e animals. In the mouth are no teeth, only two flat white bones, one in each jaw, one above, another below, with undulated &s;urfaces, which &s;erve in&s;tead of grinders. The eyes are extremely &s;mall, not larger than tho&s;e of a &s;heep. The iris is black. It is de&s;titute of ears, having only two o|rifices, &s;o &s;mall that a quill will &s;carce enter them. The tongue is pointed, and but &s;mall. The neck is thick, and its junction with the head &s;carce di&s;tingui&s;hable; and the la&s;t al|ways hangs down. The circumference of the body near the &s;houlders is twelve feet, about the belly twenty, near the tail only four feet eight; the head thirty-one inches; the neck near &s;even feet: And, from the&s;e mea&s;urements, may be col|lected the deformity of this animal. Near the &s;houlders are two feet, or rather fins, which are only two feet two inches long, and have neither fingers nor nails; beneath they are concave, and covered with hard bri&s;tles. The tail is thick, &s;trong, and horizontal, ending in a &s;tiff black fin, and like the &s;ub&s;tance of whalebone, and much &s;plit in the fore part; the end &s;lightly divided.</P>
<P>The &s;kin is very thick, black, and full of inequalities, like the bark of oak, and &s;o hard as &s;carce to be cut with an ax, and has no hair on it. Beneath the &s;kin, is a thick blubber, which ta&s;tes like oil of almonds. The fle&s;h is coar&s;er than beef, and will not &s;oon putrify. The young ones ta&s;te like veal.

<P>IN the animal kingdom, the terre&s;trial tribes
commence where the fi&s;hes terminate. The
<PB N="375" REF="443">
Manati, which is neither a quadruped nor a
whale, retains the two fore feet, or rather hands,
of the former. But the hind legs, which, in
the &s;eal and walrus, are almo&s;t entirely included
<PB N="376" REF="444">
within the body, and very much contracted, are
totally obliterated in the manati. In&s;tead of two
&s;hort feet and a &s;till &s;horter tail, which the wal|rus
carries in a horizontal direction, the manati
has only a large tail, which &s;preads out like a
fan, in the &s;ame direction; &s;o that, at fir&s;t
&s;ight, the tail of the former &s;eems to be divided
into three, and that, in the latter, the&s;e three
parts appear to be united into one. But, from
a more attentive ob&s;ervation, and particularly
from di&s;&s;ection, it appears, that no &s;uch union
takes place; that there is not a ve&s;tige of thigh-bones
and legs; and that the bones which com|po&s;e
the tail of the manati are &s;imple vertebrae,
&s;imilar to tho&s;e of the cetaceous animals, who
have no feet. Hence tho&s;e animals are ceta|ceous
by the hind part of their bodies, and are
only allied to the quadrupeds by the two fore|feet
or hands on each &s;ide of their brea&s;t. Ovi|edo
&s;eems to be the fir&s;t author who has given
a kind of hi&s;tory and de&s;cription of the manati:
&startq;This animal,&endq; he remarks, &startq;is pretty frequent
on the coa&s;ts of St Domingo. He is very
large, and of a deformed figure, with a head
thicker than that of an ox, &s;mall eyes, and two
feet or hands near the head, which &s;erve him
for &s;wimming. He has no &s;cales, but is co|vered
with a very thick &s;kin. He is a very
gentle creature. He ri&s;es on the waves and
eats the herbage on the &s;hore, which he can
reach without coming out of the water. He
<PB N="377" REF="445">
generally &s;wims on the &s;urface. In order to
&s;eize him, the people endeavour to approach
him with a boat, and then dart at him a large
arrow, fixed to a very long rope. As &s;oon as
he feels him&s;elf wounded, he runs off with
the arrow and rope, to the extremity of which
a large piece of cork or wood is tied, to &s;erve
as a buoy, that they may di&s;cover his route.
When the animal is exhau&s;ted by the wound
and lo&s;s of blood, he approaches the land.
They then lay hold of the end of the rope, and
coil it up, till only a few fathoms remain. By
the aid of the waves, he is gradually brought
to land, or they kill him in the water with
&s;pears. His weight is &s;o great, that a carriage
drawn with two oxen is nece&s;&s;ary to tran&s;port
him. His fle&s;h is excellent, and, when fre&s;h,
is preferred to beef or fi&s;h. When cut into
pieces and pickled, it in time acquires the ta&s;te
of the tunny fi&s;h, and, in this &s;tate, it is mo&s;t
highly reli&s;hed. Some of the&s;e animals are
more than fifteen feet long by &s;ix in thickne&s;s.
The hind part of the body is much thinner,
and tapers toward the tail, which again &s;preads
out at the extremity. As the Spaniards call
the fore feet of all quadrupeds <HI>hands,</HI> and as
this animal has only two fore feet, they have
denominated it the <HI>manati,</HI> or the <HI>animal with
hands.</HI> He has no external ears, but only two
apertures through which he hears. On his
&s;kin there are only a few &s;cattered hairs; it is
<PB N="378" REF="446">
of an a&s;h-colour, and an inch thick. Soles of
&s;hoes, belts, &amp;c. are made of it. The female
has two paps on her brea&s;t, and generally brings
forth two young, which &s;he &s;uckles<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Ferdin. Oviedo, hi&s;t. Ind. Occid. lib. 13. cap. 10.</NOTE>.&endq; All
the&s;e facts related by Oviedo are true; and it is
&s;ingular, that Cie&ccedil;a<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Chron. Peruv. cap. 31.</NOTE>, and &s;everal &s;ub&s;equent
writers, &s;hould affirm, that the manati comes of|ten
out of the water to pa&s;ture on the land.
They have been led into this from the analogy
of the walrus and &s;eals, which frequently quit
the water, and continue for &s;ome time on the
land. But it is certain that the manati never
leaves the water, and that he prefers fre&s;h wa|ter
to &s;alt.</P>
<P>Clu&s;ius mea&s;ured the &s;kin of one of the&s;e a|nimals,
and found it to be &s;ixteen feet and a
half long, and &s;even feet and a half broad; the
two feet or hands, were large, and armed with
&s;hort claws. Gomara<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Fr. Lopes de Gomara, hi&s;t. gen. cap. 31.</NOTE> a&s;&s;ures us, that he &s;ome|times
found them of twenty feet in length; and
adds, that they frequent the rivers as well as the
&s;ea. He relates, that a young manati was rear|ed
in a lake in the i&s;land of St Domingo during
twenty-&s;ix years; that he was &s;o gentle and
tame, that he took peaceably the food which
was pre&s;ented to him; that he knew his name,
and, when called upon, came out of the wa|ter,
and crawled to the hou&s;e to receive his
<PB N="379" REF="447">
victuals; that he &s;eemed to be plea&s;ed with the
human voice, and the chanting of children;
that he had no fear; that he allowed the boys
to &s;it on his back, and carried them from one
end of the lake to the other, without plunging
them into the water, or doing them any injury.
This relation cannot be true in all its circum|&s;tances:
It &s;eems to be accommodated to the fa|ble
of the antients concerning the dolphin; for
the manati is unable to crawl on the ground.</P>
<P>Herrera &s;ays very little on this &s;ubject: He
only a&s;&s;ures us, that, though very large, the ma|nati
&s;wims ea&s;ily, makes no noi&s;e in the water,
and dives when he hears any di&s;tant &s;ound<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">De&s;cript. des Indes Occident. par Herrera, p. 57.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Hernandes, who gives two figures of the ma|nati,
the one in profile and the other in front,
hardly adds any thing to what had been &s;aid by
former Spani&s;h authors. He only remarks, that
both the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, as well as
the lakes, produce a deformed animal, called
<HI>Manati,</HI> the de&s;cription of which he copies al|mo&s;t
entirely from Oviedo; and then adds, that
the hands of this animal have five nails, like
tho&s;e of man; that it has a large navel and a|nus;
that the vulva re&s;embles that of a woman;
that the penis is like that of a hor&s;e; that the
fle&s;h and grea&s;e are &s;imilar to tho&s;e of a fat hog;
that the ribs and vi&s;cera re&s;emble tho&s;e of a bull;
that they couple on land, the female lying on
her back; and that they produce but one young,
<PB N="380" REF="448">
which is of a mon&s;trous &s;ize the moment it is
brought forth<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Hernand. hi&s;t. Mex. p. 324.</NOTE>. The copulation of the&s;e ani|mals
cannot take place on land, becau&s;e they
are unable to walk; but it is performed in &s;hal|low
water. Binet<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Voyage en l'i&s;le de Cayenne, par Antoine Binet, p. 346.</NOTE> remarks, that the manati
is of the &s;ize of an ox, and as round as a ton;
that he has a &s;mall head, and very &s;mall tail;
that his &s;kin is as coar&s;e and thick as that of the
elephant; that &s;ome of them are &s;o large as to
yield more than &s;ix hundred pounds of excel|lent
meat; that his grea&s;e is as mild as butter;
that he delights in the mouths of rivers, where
he brow&s;es the herbs which grow on the banks;
that, in certain places, about ten or twelve
leagues from Cayenne, they are &s;o numerous,
that a ve&s;&s;el may be filled with them in one day,
by expert harpooneers. Father Tertre, who gives
a long account of the fi&s;hing of the manati, a|grees
almo&s;t in every article with the authors
we have quoted. He remarks, however, that
this animal has only four toes and four claws
on each hand; and adds, that he feeds upon a
&s;mall &s;ea-herb, which he brow&s;es in the &s;ame
manner as an ox; and that, after being &s;atiated
with this food, he &s;earches for the rivers and
fre&s;h waters, where he brow&s;es twice a day;
that, when his belly is full, he &s;leeps with his
muzzle half out of the water, which makes him
ob&s;ervable at a di&s;tance; that the female brings
<PB N="381" REF="449">
forth two young, which follow her every where;
and that, when the mother is taken, we are cer|tain
likewi&s;e of having the young, who never
depart from her, even when dead, but go per|petually
round the ve&s;&s;el which carries her<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;t. gen. des Antilles, par le P. du Tertre.</NOTE>.
This la&s;t fact appears to be very &s;u&s;picious:
It is contradicted by other voyagers, who a&s;&s;ure
us, that the manati produces but one at a time.
As all large quadrupeds, and the whale tribes,
produce one young only, analogy alone &s;hould
prevent us from believing that the manati al|ways
brings forth two. Oexmelin remarks,
that the tail of the manati is placed horizontally,
like that of the cetaceous animals, and not ver|tically,
like that of other fi&s;hes; that it has
no fore teeth, but only a kind of callo&s;ity as
hard as a bone, with which it cuts the herbage;
that it has thirty-two grinders; that it does not
&s;ee well, on account of the &s;mallne&s;s of its eyes,
which &s;ecrete very little humour, and have no
iris; that its brain is &s;mall; that, to &s;upply the
defect of good eyes, it has an excellent ear; that
it has no tongue; that the organs of generation
re&s;emble tho&s;e of man and woman more than
any other animal; that the milk of the females,
which he had ta&s;ted, is very good; that they
produce but a &s;ingle young one, which they em|brace
and carry with their hands; that the mo|ther
&s;uckles it during a whole year, after which
it is in a condition to eat herbage, and provide
<PB N="382" REF="450">
for its own &s;afety; that, from the neck to the
tail, this animal has fifty-two vertebrae; that
it feeds like the turtle, but can neither walk nor
crawl on the ground<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;t. des Avanturiers, par Oexmelin, tom. 12&punc; p. 134.</NOTE>. All the&s;e facts are pretty
exact, and even that of the fifty-two vertebrae;
for M. Daubenton, in the foetus which he di&s;|&s;ected,
found twenty-eight vertebrae in the tail,
&s;ixteen in the back, and &s;ix, or rather &s;even, in
the neck. This voyager is only deceived with
regard to the tongue, which is not wanting in
the manati. It is indeed fixed, almo&s;t to its ex|tremity,
to the under jaw. In the voyage to the
American i&s;lands, we find a very good de&s;crip|tion
of the manati, and the manner in which it
is harpooned. The principal facts mentioned
by this author corre&s;pond with tho&s;e already
quoted: But he remarks, &startq;That, &s;ince the coa&s;ts
have been inhabited, this animal has become
exceedingly rare in the Antilles; and that the
one he &s;aw and mea&s;ured was fourteen feet
nine inches from the muzzle to the origin of
the tail. The whole body was round. The
head was thick, and the mouth large, with
great lips, and &s;ome long coar&s;e hairs about
them. The eyes were very &s;mall in propor|tion
to the head; and the ears were only two
&s;mall apertures. The neck is very thick and
&s;hort; and, were it not for a &s;mall movement
which makes it wrinkle, it would be impo&s;&s;ible
to di&s;tingui&s;h the head from the body. Some
<PB N="383" REF="451">
authors pretend,&endq; he adds, &startq;that this animal
u&s;es its two hands or fins for dragging it&s;elf
along the ground. I made a particular inquiry
concerning this fact. But no per&s;on had ever
&s;een the animal on land; and it is impo&s;&s;ible
that it &s;hould either walk or crawl, the fore
feet, or hands, &s;erving only to hold its young
when &s;ucking. The female has two paps,
which I mea&s;ured, and found each of them to
be &s;even inches in diameter, by about four of
elevation. The teat was an inch thick. The
body was eight feet two inches in circumfe|rence.
The tail was like a large pallet, nine|teen
inches in length, fifteen inches broad at
the wide&s;t part, and about three inches thick at
the extremity. The &s;kin of the back was
double the thickne&s;s of an ox's hide, but much
thinner on the belly. It is of a brown &s;late
colour, and of a coar&s;e grain, with thick and
pretty long hairs of the &s;ame colour, thin|ly
&s;cattered over the body. This manati weigh|ed
about eight hundred pounds. Along with
the mother, the young one was taken, which
was nearly three feet long. A part of the tail
was roa&s;ted on a &s;pit, and we found it to be as
good and delicate as veal. The herb upon
which the&s;e animals feed is from eight to ten
inches long, narrow, pointed, tender, and of a
beautiful green colour. In &s;ome places, this
herb is &s;o abundant, that the bottom of the
&s;ea has the appearance of a meadow. The
<PB N="384" REF="452">
turtles likewi&s;e feed upon it<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Nouv. Voy. aux i&s;les de l'Amerique, tom. 2. p. 200.</NOTE>,&endq; &amp;c. Father
Magnin de Fribourg &s;ays, that the manati eats
&s;uch gra&s;s as he can reach without coming out
of the water..... That its eyes are about the
&s;ize of a filberd; that its ears are &s;o narrow as
hardly to admit a probe; that, within the ears,
there are two &s;mall perforated bones; that the
Indians hang the&s;e bones to their neck as a trin|ket....
Its cry re&s;embles the lowing of cow<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Extrait d'un MS. du Pere Magnin de Fribourg.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Father Gumilla relates, that there are immen&s;e
numbers of the manati in the great lakes of the
Oronoko: &startq;Each of the&s;e animals,&endq; &s;ays he,
&startq;weighs from &s;ix to &s;even hundred pounds.
They feed upon herbs. Their eyes are very
&s;mall, and the auditory pa&s;&s;ages &s;till &s;maller.
When the river is low, they come to pa&s;ture
on its margin. The female always brings
forth two young, which &s;he carries at her paps,
and holds them &s;o firm with her two hands,
that they never &s;eparate, whatever movement
&s;he makes. The young, when new born,
weight$ each of them, thirty pounds. The
milk of the female is very thick. Below the
&s;kin, which is much thicker than that of an ox,
we find four &s;trata, or layers; two of them
con&s;i&s;t of fat, and the other two of very ten|der,
&s;avory fle&s;h, which, when roa&s;ted, has
the flavour of pork and the ta&s;te of veal. The&s;e

<P>In fine, M. de la Condamine, who obligingly
communicated to me a drawing of the manati,
made by him&s;elf, on the river of the Amazons,
gives a more perfect account of the manners of
this animal than any other author. &startq;Its fle&s;h and
fat,&endq; he remarks, &startq;are analogous to tho&s;e of
veal: Father Acuna renders the re&s;emblance
&s;till more complete, by be&s;towing horns on it,
which Nature never provided. It is not, pro|perly
&s;peaking, amphibious; for it cannot go
entirely out of the water, having only, near
the head, two flat &s;ins, in the form of wings,
about &s;ixteen inches long, which &s;erve it for
arms and hands: He only advances his head
out of the water, in order to reach the gra&s;s
upon the &s;hore. The one of which I drew a
figure was a female. Its length was &s;even
feet and a half, and its greate&s;t width two feet.
I have &s;ince &s;een them much larger. The eyes
of this animal have no proportion to the &s;ize
of its body; they are round, and only three
lines in diameter. The auditory pa&s;&s;ages are
&s;till &s;maller, and appear only like pin holes.
The manati is not peculiar to the river of the
Amazons, but is equally common in the Oro|noko.
<PB N="386" REF="454">
It is al&s;o found, though not &s;o fre|quently,
in the Oyapoc, and in &s;everal other
rivers in the neighbourhood of Cayenne, and
on the coa&s;ts of Guiana, and probably el&s;e|where.
This is the &s;ame animal which was
formerly called <HI>manati,</HI> and now <HI>lamantin,</HI> at
Cayenne, and in our American i&s;lands; but I
believe the &s;pecies is &s;omewhat different. They
are never met with in the high &s;eas, and are
even rare in the mouths of rivers. But they
are found, at more than a thou&s;and leagues
from the &s;ea, in mo&s;t of the large rivers which
fall into that of the Amazons, as in the Gual|laga,
the Pa&s;taca, &amp;c. In a&s;cending the river of
the Amazons, they are &s;topped by the Pongo
(cataract) of Borja, above which they never
appear<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Voyage &s;ur la rivi&egrave;re des Amazones, par M. de la Con|damine, p. 154. Mem. de l'Acad. des &s;ciences, 1745. p. 464.</NOTE>.&endq;</P>
<P>I have now given a conci&s;e account of all that
is known concerning the manati. It were to be
wi&s;hed that &s;ome of the inhabitants of Cayenne,
among whom there are &s;everal per&s;ons well ac|quainted
with natural hi&s;tory, would examine
this animal, and give us a de&s;cription of its in|ternal
parts, particularly tho&s;e of re&s;piration, of
dige&s;tion, and of generation. It appears, but we
are by no means certain, that there is a large
bone in the penis, and a foramen ovale in the
heart; that the lungs are &s;ingularly con&s;truct|ed;
<PB N="387" REF="455">
and that it has &s;everal &s;tomachs, as in the
ruminating animals.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, the &s;pecies of the manati is not con|&s;ined
to the &s;eas and rivers of the New World,
but &s;eems likewi&s;e to exi&s;t on the coa&s;ts and in
the rivers of Africa. M. Adan&s;on &s;aw manatis
in Senegal, from which he brought one of their
heads and gave it to me; and, at the &s;ame time,
he obliged me with a de&s;cription of this animal,
which he made on the &s;pot, and which I here
in&s;ert in his own words. &startq;I &s;aw many of the&s;e
animals. The large&s;t exceeded not eight feet
long, and weighed about eight hundred pounds.
A female of five feet three inches in length,
weighed only a hundred and ninety-four
pounds. They are of a blacki&s;h a&s;h-colour.
There are hairs thinly &s;cattered over the whole
body, in the form of bri&s;tles, and are nine lines
long. The head is conical, and of a middling
&s;ize, in proportion to that of the body. The
eyes are round and very &s;mall. The iris is of a
deep blue colour, and the pupil black. The
muzzle is almo&s;t cylindrical; the two jaws are
nearly of an equal &s;ize, and the lips are thick
and fle&s;hy. It has no teeth but grinders in
either jaw. The tongue is of an oval form,
and attached, almo&s;t as far as the point, to
the under jaw. It is &s;ingular, that almo&s;t all
authors and travellers have given ears to this
animal. I could not di&s;cover, in any of them,
<PB N="388" REF="456">
a hole &s;ufficient even to admit a &s;mall probe<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">It is certain, however, that this animal has external au|ditory pa&s;&s;ages. M. de la Condamine informed me, that he had &s;een and mea&s;ured them, and that they exceeded not half a line in diameter. As the manati has the power of con|tracting or &s;hutting them, it is probable that they had e&s;caped the ob&s;ervation of M. Adan&s;on, e&s;pecially as tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ages are very &s;mall, even when the animal keeps them open.</NOTE>.
He has two arms or fins, &s;ituated at the ori|gin
of the head, which is not di&s;tingui&s;hable
from the trunk by any kind of neck, or by
&s;houlders that are perceptible. The&s;e arms
are nearly cylindrical, and con&s;i&s;t of three
principal articulations; the anterior one forms
a kind of flat hand, in which the toes are on|ly
to be di&s;tingui&s;hed by four claws of a
&s;hining reddi&s;h brown colour. The tail is
horizontal, like that of the whale; and it has
the figure of a baker's &s;hovel. The female
has two paps, rather elliptic than round, and
&s;ituated near the pits of the arms. The &s;kin
is half an inch thick on the belly, nine lines
on the back, and an inch and a half on the
head. The fat is white, and two or three
inches thick. The fle&s;h is of a pale red colour,
and more delicate than veal. The Jalofe Ne|groes
call this animal <HI>Lereou.</HI> It lives upon
herbage, and is found in the mouth of the
river Niger.&endq;</P>

Cayenne; and, from a compari&s;on made by M.

&startq;While we lay here, our Mu&s;kito men went in

&s;ea cow. Be&s;ides this Blewfield's river, I have
<PB N="390" REF="458">
&s;een of the manatee in the bay of Compeachy,
on the coa&s;ts of Bocca del Drago, and Bocco
del Toro, in the river of Darien, and among
the South Keys, or little i&s;lands of Cuba. I
have heard of there being found on the North
of Jamaica a few, and in the rivers of Suri|nam
in great multitudes, which is a very low
land. I have &s;een of them al&s;o at Mindanea,
one of the Philippine i&s;lands, and on the coa&s;t
of New Holland.... The manatee delights
to live in bracki&s;h water; and they are com|monly
in creeks and rivers near the &s;ea. It is
for this rea&s;on, po&s;&s;ibly, they are not &s;een in
the South &s;eas, that ever I could ob&s;erve,
where the coa&s;t is generally a bold &s;hore, that
is, high land, and deep water clo&s;e home by
it, with a high &s;ea or great &s;urges, except in
the bay of Panama; yet even there is no ma|natee.
Whereas the We&s;t Indies, being, as it
were, one great bay compo&s;ed of many &s;mal|ler,
are mo&s;tly low land and &s;hoal water, and
afford proper pa&s;ture, as I may &s;ay, for the
manatee. Sometimes we find them in &s;alt
water, &s;ometimes in fre&s;h, but never fat at
&s;ea. And tho&s;e that live in the &s;ea at &s;uch
places where there is no river nor creek fit for
them to enter, yet do commonly come once or
twice in twenty-four hours to the mouth of
any fre&s;h water river that is near their place

the fat and the lean, and extraordinary &s;weet

<HEAD>OF THE DEGENERATION
OF ANIMALS.</HEAD>
<P>WHENEVER man began to change his
climate, and to migrate from one coun|try
to another, his nature was &s;ubjected to va|rious
alterations. In temperate countries, which
we &s;uppo&s;e to be adjacent to the place where he
was originally produced, the&s;e alterations have
been &s;light; but they augmented in proportion
as he receded from this &s;tation: And, after
many ages had elap&s;ed; after he had traver&s;ed
whole continents, and intermixed with races
already degenerated by the influence of different
climates; after he was habituated to the &s;corch|ing
heats of the South, and the frozen regions
of the North; the changes he underwent be|came
&s;o great and &s;o con&s;picuous, as to give
room for &s;u&s;pecting, that the Negro, the Lap|lander,
and the White, were really different
&s;pecies, if, on the one hand, we were not cer|tain,
that only one man was originally created,
and, on the other, that the White, the Laplan|der,
and the Negro, are capable of uniting, and
of propagating the great and undivided family
of the human kind. Hence tho&s;e marks which
di&s;tingui&s;h men who inhabit different regions of
<PB N="393" REF="465">
the earth, are not original, but purely &s;uperficial.
It is the &s;ame identical being who is varni&s;hed
with black under the Torrid Zone, and tawned
and contracted by extreme cold under the Polar
Circle. This circum&s;tance is alone &s;ufficient to de|mon&s;trate,
that the nature of man is endowed with
greater &s;trength, exten&s;ion, and flexibility, than
that of any other terre&s;trial being; for vegetables,
and almo&s;t all the animals, are con$ined to par|ticular
&s;oils and climates. This exten&s;ion of our
nature depends more on the qualities of the
mind than tho&s;e of the body. It is by the mind
that man has been enabled to find tho&s;e re&s;ources
which the delicacy of his body required, to brave
the inclemency of the &s;ky, and to conquer the
rigidity and barrenne&s;s of the earth. He may
be &s;aid to have &s;ubdued the elements: By an
exertion of his intellect, he produced the ele|ment
of fire, which had no exi&s;tence on the &s;ur|face
of the earth. His &s;agacity taught him how
to clothe his body, and to build hou&s;es for
defending him&s;elf again&s;t every external attack.
By the powers of genius he &s;upplied all the qua|lities
which are wanting in matter. Without
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the &s;trength, the magnitude, or the
robu&s;tne&s;s of mo&s;t animals, he knew how to
conquer, to tame, and to confine them: He
made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of tho&s;e regions which
Nature &s;eemed to have re&s;igned to them as an
exclu&s;ive po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P><PB N="394" REF="466">
The earth is divided into two great Continents
The antiquity of this divi&s;ion exceeds that of all
human monuments; and yet man is more antient;
for he is the &s;ame in both worlds. The A&s;iatic, the
European, and the Negro, produce equally with
the American. Nothing can be a &s;tronger proof
that they belong to the &s;ame family, than the
facility with which they unite to the common
&s;tock. The blood is different; but the germ is
the &s;ame. The &s;kin, the hair, the features, and
the &s;tature, have varied, without any change in
the internal &s;tructure. The type is general and
common: And if, by any great revolution, man
were forced to abandon tho&s;e climates which he
had invaded, and to return to his native coun|try,
he would, in the progre&s;s of time, re&s;ume
his original features, his primitive &s;tature, and
his natural colour. But the mixture of races
would produce this effect much &s;ooner. A
white male with a black female, or a black male
with a white female, equally produce a mulat|to,
who&s;e colour is brown, or a mixture of
black and white. This mulatoo intermixing
with a white, produces a &s;econd mulatto le&s;s
brown than the former; and, if the &s;econd
mulatto unites with a white, the third will have
only a &s;light &s;hade of brown, which will entire|ly
vani&s;h in future generations. Hence, by this
mixture, 150, or 200 years, are &s;ufficient to
bleach the &s;kin of a Negro. But, to produce the
&s;ame effect by the influence of climate alone,
<PB N="395" REF="467">
many centuries would perhaps be nece&s;&s;ary.
Since the Negroes were tran&s;ported to America,
which is about two hundred years ago, the Ne|gro
families, who have pre&s;erved them&s;elves
from mixture, &s;eem not to have lo&s;t any &s;hade
of their original colour. The climate of South
America, it is true, being &s;ufficiently hot to tawn
its inhabitants, we ought not to be &s;urpri&s;ed
that the Negroes there continue black. To put
the change of colour in the human &s;pecies to the
te&s;t of experiment, &s;ome Negroes &s;hould be
tran&s;ported from Senegal to Denmark, where
the inhabitants have generally white &s;kins, golden
locks, and blue eyes, and where the difference
of blood and oppo&s;ition of colour are greate&s;t.
The&s;e Negroes mu&s;t be confined to their own
females, and all cro&s;&s;ing of the breed &s;crupu|lou&s;ly
prevented. This is the only method of
di&s;covering the time nece&s;&s;ary to change a Ne|gro
into a White, or a White into a Black, by
the mere operation of climate.</P>
<P>This is the greate&s;t alteration that climate has
produced in man, and yet it is only &s;uper$icial.
The colour of the &s;kin, hair, and eyes, varies
by the influence of climate alone. The other
changes, &s;uch as tho&s;e of &s;tature, figure, features,
and quality of the hair, &s;eem to require the joint
operations of climate and other cau&s;es; for, in
the Negro race, who have generally cri&s;ped wool
in&s;tead of hair, a flat no&s;e, and thick lips, there
are whole nations with long hair and regular
<PB N="396" REF="468">
features: And, in the race of Whites, if we
compare the Dane to the Calmuck Tartar, or e|ven
the Finlander to the Laplander, who&s;e na|tions
are contiguous, we &s;hall find among them
as great a difference in features and &s;ize as takes
place among the Negroes. To produce &s;uch al|terations,
therefore, which are deeper than the
former, &s;ome other cau&s;es mu&s;t concur with the
influence of climate. The mo&s;t direct and ge|neral
cau&s;e is the quality of the food. It is
chiefly by aliment that man receives the influ|ence
of the &s;oil which he inhabits: That of the
air and climate acts more &s;uperficially. While
the climate changes the colour of the &s;kin, food
acts upon the internal form by its qualities,
which are always related to tho&s;e of the earth
by which it is produced. Even in the &s;ame
country, we &s;ee &s;triking differences between tho&s;e
who occupy the heights and tho&s;e who inhabit
the low grounds. The inhabitants of the moun|tains
are always better made, more vivacious,
and more beautiful than tho&s;e of the vallies.
Hence, in countries remote from the original
climate, where the herbs, fruits, grains, and the
fle&s;h of animals differ both in quality and &s;ub|&s;tance,
the men who feed upon the&s;e articles
mu&s;t undergo &s;till greater changes. The&s;e im|pre&s;&s;ions
are not &s;uddenly made. A con&s;idera|ble
time is nece&s;&s;ary before man receives the
$inge peculiar to the climate, and &s;till more before
the &s;oil communicates to him its qualities. It re|quires
<PB N="397" REF="469">
ages, joined to the con&s;tant u&s;e of the &s;ame
food, to change the features, the &s;ize of the bo|dy,
and the &s;ub&s;tance of the hair, and to produce
tho&s;e internal alterations which, when perpetua|ted
by generation, become general and perma|nent
characteri&s;tics which di&s;tingui&s;h the dif|rent
races and nations who compo&s;e the agree|gate
of the human &s;pecies.</P>
<P>In brute animals, the&s;e effects are greater and
more &s;uddenly accompli&s;hed; becau&s;e they are
more nearly allied to the earth than man; becau&s;e
their food being more uniformly the &s;ame, and
nowi&s;e prepared, its qualities are more decided,
and its influence &s;tronger; and becau&s;e the ani|mals,
being unable to clothe them&s;elves, or to
u&s;e the element of $ire, remain perpetually ex|po&s;ed
to the action of the air, and all the incle|mencies
of the climate. For this rea&s;on, each
of them, according to its nature, has cho&s;en its
zone and its country: For the &s;ame rea&s;on, they
remain there, and, in&s;tead of di&s;per&s;ing them|&s;elves,
like man, they generally continue in tho&s;e
places which are mo&s;t friendly to their con&s;titu|tions.
And, when forced by men, or by any
revolution on the globe, to abandon their native
&s;oil, their nature has undergone changes &s;o great,
that, to recogni&s;e them, recour&s;e mu&s;t be had to
accurate examination, and even to experiment
and analogy. If to the&s;e natural cau&s;es of alte|ration
in free animals, we add that of the em|pire
of man over tho&s;e which he has reduced to
<PB N="398" REF="470">
&s;lavery, we will be a&s;toni&s;hed at the degree to
which tyranny can degrade and disfigure Na|ture;
we will perceive the marks of &s;lavery, and
the prints of her chains; and we will find, that
the&s;e wounds are deeper and more incurable, in
proportion to their antiquity; and that, in the
pre&s;ent condition of dome&s;tic animals, it is per|haps
impo&s;&s;ible to re&s;tore their primitive form,
and tho&s;e attributes of nature which we have ta|ken
from them.</P>
<P>Thus the temperature of the climate, the qua|lity
of the food, and the evils produced by &s;la|very,
are the three cau&s;es of the changes and de|generation
of animals. The effects of each me|rit
a &s;eparate examination; and their relations,
when viewed in detail, will exhibit a picture of
Nature in her pre&s;ent condition, and of what
&s;he was before he degradation.</P>
<P>Let us compare our pitiful &s;heep with the
mouflon from whom they derived their origin.
The mouflon is a large animal. He is fleet as
a &s;tag, armed with horns and thick hoofs, co|vered
with coar&s;e hair, and dreads neither the
inclemency of the &s;ky, nor the voracity of the
wolf. He not only e&s;capes from his enemies by
the &s;wiftne&s;s of his cour&s;e, but he re&s;i&s;ts them
by the &s;trength of his body, and the &s;olidity of
the arms with which his head and feet are for|ti$ied.
How different from our &s;heep, who &s;ub|&s;i&s;t
with difficulty in flocks, who are unable to
defend them&s;elves by their numbers, who can|not
<PB N="399" REF="471">
endure the cold of our winters without &s;hel|ter,
and who would all peri&s;h, if man withdrew
his protection? In the warme&s;t climates of A&s;ia
and Africa, the mouflon, who is the common
parent of all the races of this &s;pecies, appears to
be le&s;s degenerated than in any other region.
Though reduced to a dome&s;tic &s;tate, he has pre&s;er|ved
his &s;tature and his hair; but the &s;ize of his
horns are dimini&s;hed. Of all dome&s;tic &s;heep,
tho&s;e of Senegal and India are the large&s;t, and
their nature has &s;uffered lea&s;t degradation. The
&s;heep of Barbary, Egypt, Arabia, Per&s;ia, Kal|muck,
&amp;c. have undergone greater changes. In
relation to man, they are improved in &s;ome ar|ticles,
and vitiated in others. But, with regard
to Nature, improvement and degeneration are
the &s;ame thing; for they both imply an altera|tion
of original con&s;titution. Their coar&s;e hair
is changed into fine wool. Their tail, loaded
with a ma&s;s of fat, has acquired a magnitude &s;o
incommodious, that the animals trail it with
pain. While &s;wollen with &s;uperfluous matter,
and adorned with a beautiful fleece, their &s;trength,
agility, magnitude, and arms, are dimini&s;hed:
The&s;e long-tailed &s;heep are only half the &s;ize
of the mouflon. They can neither fly from
danger, nor re&s;i&s;t the enemy. To pre&s;erve and
multiply the &s;pecies, they require the con&s;tant
care and &s;upport of man.</P>
<P>The degeneration of the original &s;pecies is
&s;till greater in our climates. Of all the quali|ties
<PB N="400" REF="472">
of the mouflon, our ewes and rams have re|tained
nothing bnt a &s;mall portion of vivacity,
which yields to the crook of the &s;hepherd. Ti|midity,
weakne&s;s, re&s;ignation, and &s;tupidity, are
the only melancholy remains of their degraded
nature. To re&s;tore their original &s;ize and
&s;trength, our Flanders &s;heep &s;hould be united
with the mouflon, and prevented from propaga|ting
with inferior races; and, if we would devote
the &s;pecies to the more u&s;eful purpo&s;es of afford|ing
us good mutton and wool, we &s;hould imi|tate
&s;ome neighbouring nations in propagating
the Barbary race of &s;heep, which, after being
tran&s;ported into Spain, and even into Britain,
have &s;ucceeded very well. Strength and mag|nitude
are male attributes; plumpne&s;s and beauty
of &s;kin are female qualities. To obtain fine
wool, therefore, our rams &s;hould have Barbary
ewes; and, to augment the &s;ize, our ewes &s;hould
be &s;erved with the male mouflon.</P>
<P>Our goats might be managed in the &s;ame man|ner.
By intermixing them with the goat of An|gora,
their hair might be changed, and rendered
equally u&s;eful with the fine&s;t wool. In our cli|mate,
the &s;pecies of the goat is not &s;o much de|generated
as that of the &s;heep. It appears
to be &s;till more degenerated in the warm coun|tries
of Africa and India. The &s;malle&s;t and
weake&s;t goats are tho&s;e of Guinea, Juda, &amp;c. and
<PB N="401" REF="473">
yet the&s;e countries produce the large&s;t and &s;trong|e&s;t
&s;heep.</P>
<P>The &s;pecies of the ox is more influenced by
nouri&s;hment than that of any other dome&s;tic
animal. In countries where the pa&s;ture is rich
and always &s;pringing, they acquire a prodigious
&s;ize. The antients gave to the oxen of Aethi|opia,
and &s;ome other provinces of A&s;ia, the ap|pellation
of <HI>Elephant-bulls;</HI> becau&s;e, in the&s;e
countries, they approach to the magnitude of
elephants. This effect is produced by the abun|dance
of rich and &s;ucculent herbage. Of this our
own climate affords a proof. An ox fed on the tops
of the green mountains of Savoy or Switzerland,
acquire double the &s;ize of our oxen; and yet the
oxen in Switzerland, like ours, are fed in &s;tables
during the greate&s;t part of the year. The dif|ference
ari&s;es from this circum&s;tance, that the
Switzerland oxen are &s;et out to free pa&s;ture as
&s;oon as the &s;now melts, while ours are not per|mitted
to enter the meadows till the hay, which
is re&s;erved for the hor&s;es, is carried off; and,
of cour&s;e, they are neither fully nor properly
nouri&s;hed. It would be extremely u&s;eful to the
&s;tate, if a regulation were made for aboli&s;hing
promi&s;cuous pa&s;turage, and permitting inclo&s;ures.
The climate has likewi&s;e con&s;iderable influence
on the nature of the ox. In the northern re|gions
of both Continents, he is covered with
long, &s;oft hair, like fine wool. He has al&s;o a
large bunch on his &s;houlders; and this defor|mity
<PB N="402" REF="474">
is common to the oxen of A&s;ia, Africa, and
America. Tho&s;e of Europe alone have no
bunch. The European oxen, however, are the
primitive race, to which the bunched kind a|&s;cend,
by intermixture, in the fir&s;t or &s;econd ge|neration.
What proves this race to be only a
variety of the other, is, that it is &s;ubject to very
great degradations. The differences in their
&s;ize is enormous. The &s;mall zebu of Arabia is
not one tenth part of the magnitude of the Ae|thiopian
<HI>bull-elephant.</HI></P>
<P>In general, the influence of food is greater,
and produces more &s;en&s;ible effects upon tho&s;e
animals which feed on herbs or fruits. Carni|vorous
animals, on the contrary, are le&s;s affected
by this cau&s;e than by the influence of climates;
becau&s;e fle&s;h is an aliment already a&s;&s;imilated to
the nature of the animal that devours it. But
gra&s;s is the fir&s;t product of the earth, and has
all the properties of it; and the&s;e terre&s;trial
qualities are immediately communicated to the
animal.</P>
<P>Thus the dog &s;pecies, upon which food &s;eems
to have a very &s;light influence, is more varied
than that of any other carnivorous animal. In
his degradations, he appears to follow exactly
the differences of climate. He is naked in the
warme&s;t climates, covered with a coar&s;e thick
hair in the northern regions, and adorned with
a fine &s;ilky robe in Spain and in Syria, where
the mild temperature of the air converts the hair
<PB N="403" REF="475">
of mo&s;t animals into a kind of &s;ilk. But, inde|pendent
of the&s;e external varieties, which are
produced by the influence of climate alone, the
dog is &s;ubjected to other changes that proceed
from his &s;ituation, his captivity, or from the na|ture
of the intercour&s;e he holds with man. The
augmentation and diminution of his &s;ize, are ef|fects
of the attention be&s;towed in uniting the
large&s;t or &s;malle&s;t individuals. The &s;hortening
of the tail, muzzle, and ears, proceeds likewi&s;e
from the hand of man. Dogs who, for a few
generations, have had their ears and tail cut,
tran&s;mit the&s;e defects, in a certain propor|tion,
to their de&s;cendents. I have &s;een dogs
produced without tails, which I at fir&s;t appre|hended
to be individual mon&s;ters: But I have
&s;ince learned that this race exi&s;ts, and is perpe|tuated
by generation. Pendulous ears, the mo&s;t
general and mo&s;t certain mark of dome&s;tic &s;er|vitude,
are common to almo&s;t all dogs. Of
thirty different races, which compo&s;e the &s;pecies,
only two or three have pre&s;erved their primitive
ears. The &s;hepherd's dog, the wolf-dog, and
the dog of the North, alone, have erect ears. The
voice of the&s;e animals has likewi&s;e undergone
&s;trange alterations. The dog &s;eems to have be|come
clamorous and noi&s;y in the &s;ociety of man,
who employs his tongue more than any other
being; for the dog, in a &s;tate of nature, is al|mo&s;t
mute, uttering only a kind of howling
when pre&s;&s;ed with hunger. He acquired his
<PB N="404" REF="476">
faculty of barking by his commerce with men
in poli&s;hed &s;ociety; for, when tran&s;ported to
extreme climates, and among a gro&s;s people,
&s;uch as the Laplanders or Negroes, he lo&s;es his
barking, a&s;&s;umes his natural howling, and be|comes
almo&s;t perfectly mute. The dogs with e|rect
ears, and particularly the &s;hepherd's dog,
which is lea&s;t degenerated, makes al&s;o the lea&s;t
u&s;e of his voice. As he pa&s;&s;es a &s;olitary life in
the country, and has no intercour&s;e but with
&s;heep and a few &s;imple men, like them, he is
&s;erious and &s;ilent, though, at the &s;ame time, ve|ry
active and intelligent. Of all dogs, he has
fewe&s;t acquired talents, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es a greater
number of tho&s;e which are natural. He is like|wi&s;e
the mo&s;t u&s;eful for guarding our flocks,
and for the pre&s;ervation of good order. His
race ought, therefore, to be more multiplied
than tho&s;e of other dogs, who mini&s;ter only to
our amu&s;ements, and who&s;e numbers are &s;o
great, that, in every town and village, the pro|vi&s;ions
con&s;umed by them would nouri&s;h many
families.</P>
<P>The dome&s;tic &s;tate has greatly contributed to
vary the colour of animals, which, in general,
was originally brown or black. The dog, the
ox, the goat, the &s;heep, the hor&s;e, have a&s;&s;umed
all kinds of colours. The hog has changed from
black to white; and pure white, without any
&s;pots, &s;eems to mark the la&s;t degree of degene|ration,
and it is generally accompanied with e&s;|&s;ential
<PB N="405" REF="477">
imperfections. In the race of white men,
tho&s;e who are remarkably white, and who&s;e
hair, eye-brows, beard, &amp;c. are likewi&s;e white,
have often a defect in their hearing, and, at the
&s;ame time, red and weak eyes. In the black
race, the white Negroes are &s;till more feeble and
defective. All the quadrupeds which are ab&s;o|lutely
white, have the &s;ame faults of dullne&s;s of
hearing and red eyes. This kind of degenera|tion,
though more frequent among dome&s;tic a|nimals,
&s;ometimes appears among the wild &s;pe|cies,
as in tho&s;e of the elephant, &s;tags, fallow-deer,
monkeys, moles, and mice; in all of
which this colour is uniformly accompanied with
&s;maller or greater degrees of bodily weakne&s;s,
and bluntne&s;s of the &s;en&s;es.</P>
<P>But &s;lavery &s;eems to have made the deepe&s;t
and mo&s;t con&s;picuous impre&s;&s;ions on the ca|mel.
He is brought forth with bunches on his
back, and callo&s;ities on his brea&s;t and knees.
The&s;e callo&s;ities are evidently wounds occa&s;ion|ed
by friction; for they are filled with pus and
corrupted blood. As he never walks but under
a heavy load, the pre&s;&s;ure of which prevents
the uniform exten&s;ion and growth of the mu&s;|cles
of the back, and produces a &s;welling in
the parts adjacent, in the &s;ame manner, when
he lies down or &s;leeps, he is at fir&s;t obliged
to re&s;t upon his folded limbs. This po&s;ture
becomes at la&s;t habitual. For &s;everal hours
every day, the whole weight of his body is
<PB N="406" REF="478">
&s;upported by his brea&s;t and knees. The &s;kin
of tho&s;e parts is rubbed off by pre&s;&s;ing again&s;t
the earth, and they &s;oon become callous, and
lo&s;e their organization. The lama, which, like
the camel, pa&s;&s;es his life under a burden, and al&s;o
repo&s;es on his brea&s;t, has &s;imilar callo&s;ities, which
are perpetuated by generation. The baboons
and monkeys, who&s;e general po&s;ture, whether
a&s;leep or awake, is &s;itting, have callo&s;ities on
their buttocks. This callous &s;kin even adheres
to the bones again&s;t which it is continually pre&s;|&s;ed
by the weight of the body. But the&s;e cal|lo&s;ities
of the baboons and monkeys are dry
and heal; becau&s;e they proceed not from re|&s;traint,
nor from the weight of any foreign
load. They are, on the contrary, effects of
a natural habit; for tho&s;e animals continue
longer in a &s;itting than in any other po&s;ture.
The&s;e callo&s;ities of the monkeys are &s;imilar to
the double &s;kin on the &s;ole of a man's foot.
This &s;ole is a natural callo&s;ity, which our con|&s;tant
habit of walking or &s;tanding renders more
or le&s;s thick, according to the quantity of exer|ci&s;e
we take.</P>
<P>The wild animals, not being under the im|mediate
dominion of man, are not &s;ubject to
&s;uch great changes as the dome&s;tic kinds. Their
nature &s;eems to vary with different climates;
but it is no where degraded: If they were
capable of choo&s;ing their climate and their food,
the changes they undergo would be &s;till le&s;s.
<PB N="407" REF="479">
But, as they have at all times been hunted and
bani&s;hed by man, or even by the &s;tronge&s;t and
mo&s;t ferocious quadrupeds, mo&s;t of them have
been obliged to abandon their native country,
and to occupy lands le&s;s friendly to their con|&s;titution.
Tho&s;e who&s;e nature had flexibility
enough to accommodate them&s;elves to this new
&s;ituation, have diffu&s;ed over va&s;t territories; while
others have had no other re&s;ource than to con|fine
them&s;elves in the de&s;erts adjacent to their
own country. There is no animal which, like
man, has &s;pread over the whole &s;urface of the
earth. A great number of &s;pecies are limited
to the &s;outhern regions of the Old, and others
to the &s;ame regions of the New Continent. O|thers,
though fewer, are confined to the nor|thern
regions, and, in&s;tead of extending to the
&s;outh, have pa&s;&s;ed from the one Continent to
the other, by routes which are &s;till undi&s;covered.
Other &s;pecies inhabit only particular mountains
or vallies: And, the changes in their nature
are, in general, le&s;s &s;en&s;ible, the more they are
confined to a &s;mall circle.</P>
<P>As climate and food have little influence on
wild animals, and the empire of man &s;till le&s;s,
the chief varieties among&s;t them proceed from
another cau&s;e. They depend on the number
of individuals of tho&s;e which produce, as well
as of tho&s;e that are produced. In tho&s;e &s;pecies
in which the male attaches him&s;elf to one fe|male,
as in that of the roebuck, the young de|mon&s;trate
<PB N="408" REF="480">
the fidelity of their parents by their
entire re&s;emblance to them. In tho&s;e, on the
contrary, the females of which often change
the male, as in that of the &s;tag, the varieties
are numerous: And as, through the whole
extent of Nature, there is not one individual
perfectly &s;imilar to another, the varieties among
animals are proportioned to the number and
frequency of their produce. In &s;pecies, the fe|males
of which bring forth five or &s;ix young,
three or four times a year, the number of va|rieties
mu&s;t be much $reater than in tho&s;e which
produce but a &s;ingle young once a year. The
&s;mall animals, accordingly, which produce of|tener
and in greater numbers than the larger
kinds, are &s;ubject to greater varieties. Magni|tude
of body, which appears to be only a rela|tive
quality, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es po&s;itive rights in the laws
of Nature. Magnitude is as fixed as minutene&s;s
is changeable. Of this fact we &s;hall &s;oon be
convinced by the following enumeration of the
varieties which take place in the large and &s;mall
animals.</P>
<P>In Guinea, the ears of the wild boar are very
long, and lie on his back. In China, his belly
is large and pendulous, and his legs are very
&s;hort. At Cape Verd, and in other places, his
tu&s;ks are very thick, and bended like the horns
of an ox. In a dome&s;tic &s;tate, and in cold or
temperate climates, his ears are half pendulous,
and his bri&s;tles are white. I reckon neither
<PB N="409" REF="481">
the pecari, nor the babirou&s;&s;a among the varie|ties
of the wild boar; becau&s;e they belong not
to this &s;pecies, though they approach nearer to
it than to any other.</P>
<P>In warm, dry, and mountainous countries,
&s;uch as Cor&s;ica and Sardinia, the &s;tag has lo&s;t
one half of his &s;ize, his hair has become
brown, and his horns blacki&s;h. In cold and
moi&s;t countries, &s;uch as Bohemia and the Ar|dennes,
his &s;ize is increa&s;ed, his coat and horns
are almo&s;t black, and his hair is &s;o long that it
forms a kind of beard on his chin. In North
America, the horns of the &s;tag are extended,
and branched with crooked antlers. In a do|me&s;tic
&s;tate, his coat changes from yellow to
white; and, unle&s;s when at liberty, or in very
large inclo&s;ures, his limbs are deformed and
crooked. The axis is not to be reckoned among
the varieties of the &s;tag: It approaches nearer
to that of the fallow-deer, of which, perhaps,
it is only a variety.</P>
<P>In the fallow-deer, it is difficult to a&s;certain
the original &s;pecies. He is no where entirely
dome&s;tic nor ab&s;olutely wild. He varies indif|ferently
from yellow to pied, and from pied to
white. His horns and tail are al&s;o larger and
longer, in different races, and his fle&s;h is good
or bad, according to the &s;oil and climate. Like
the &s;tag, he is found in both Continents; and
he &s;eems to be larger in Virginia, and other
temperate provinces of America, than in Eu|rope.
<PB N="410" REF="482">
The roebuck is likewi&s;e larger in the
New than in the Old Continent. But, in o|ther
re&s;pects, all his variations are confined to
&s;ome differences in the colour of the hair, which
changes from yellow to brown. The &s;malle&s;t
roebucks are generally brown, and the large&s;t
yellow. The roebuck and fallow-deer are
the only animals common to both Continents
which are larger and &s;tronger in the New than
in the Old World.</P>
<P>The a&s;s, though &s;ubjected to the pre&s;&s;ure of
the mo&s;t wretched &s;ervitude, has undergone
few changes; for his nature is &s;o obdurate, that
it equally re&s;i&s;ts bad treatment and the inconve|niencies
of a foreign climate and of coar&s;e food.
Though originally a native of warm countries,
he can exi&s;t and even multiply, without the a&s;|&s;i&s;tance
of man, in temperate climates. For|merly
there were onagers, or wild a&s;&s;es, in all
the de&s;erts of A&s;ia Minor; but they are now
rare, and are numerous in the de&s;erts of Tartary
only. The mule of Dauria<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Mulus Dauricus foecundus, <HI>Czigithai</HI> Mongolorum in Dauria; <HI>Mu&s;. Petropolitanum, p.</HI> 335.</NOTE>, called <HI>czigithai</HI>
by the Tartars, is probably the &s;ame animal with
the onager of the other A&s;iatic provinces. The
former differs from the latter only in the length
and colour of the hair, which, according to Mr
Bell, is undulated with brown and white<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">In the fore&s;ts near Kuznet&s;ky on the river Tom, one of the &s;ources of the river Oby, in lat. 51 and 52, are wild a&s;&s;es. I have &s;een many of their &s;kins; they have in all re|&s;pects the &s;hape of the head, tail, and hoofs of the common a&s;s; but their &s;kin is waved and undulated white and brown; <HI>Bell's travels to China. Nota.</HI> The &s;kins which Mr Bell &s;aw might be tho&s;e of the zebra; for other travellers alledge not that the <HI>czigithais</HI> or <HI>onagers</HI> of Dauria are &s;triped, like the zebra, with brown and white. Be&s;ides, in the Peter&s;burg cabinet, there are &s;kins both of the zebra and of the czigithai, which are equally &s;hown to &s;trangers.</NOTE>.
<PB N="411" REF="483">
The&s;e <HI>czigithais</HI> are found in the fore&s;ts of Tar|tary
as far as the 51&s;t and 52d degree of lati|tude.
They mu&s;t not be confounded with the
zebra, who&s;e colours are more vivid, and dif|ferently
di&s;po&s;ed. Be&s;ides, the zebra con&s;titutes
a particular &s;pecies, as different from the a&s;s
as from the hor&s;e. In the dome&s;tic a&s;s, the
&s;kin has become &s;ofter, and lo&s;t tho&s;e &s;mall tu|bercles
which are di&s;per&s;ed over that of the o|nagers,
and of which the inhabitants of the
Levant make the leather called <HI>chagrin.</HI></P>
<P>The nature of the hare is both flexible and
firm; for, though it is diffu&s;ed over almo&s;t every
climate of the Old Continent, yet it continues
nearly the &s;ame. In very cold climates, its hair
whitens during the winter, and, in &s;ummer, re|&s;umes
its natural colour, which varies only from
yellow to red. The quality of the fle&s;h like|wi&s;e
changes. The fle&s;h of the reddi&s;h hares is
always the be&s;t. But the rabbit, though not of
&s;o flexible a nature as the hare, being le&s;s dif|fu&s;ed,
and even confined to certain countries, is
&s;ubject to more variations; becau&s;e the hare is
<PB N="412" REF="484">
every where wild, while the rabbit is almo&s;t
every where half dome&s;tic. The colour of the
burrowed rabbits varies from yellow to gray,
white, and black. They likewi&s;e vary in &s;ize,
and in the quantity and quality of the hair.
This animal, which is originally a native of
Spain, has acquired a long tail in Tartary, and
bu&s;hy hair, like felt, in Syria, &amp;c. In cold
countries, black hares are &s;ometimes found. It
is likewi&s;e alledged, that, in Norway, and &s;ome
other northern regions, there are hares with
horns. M. Klein has given figures of two of
the&s;e horned hares<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Klein de quad. p. 52. tab. 3. fig. ad &sect; 21.</NOTE>. From in&s;pection of the&s;e
figures, it is ea&s;y to perceive, that the horns are
&s;imilar to the <HI>wood,</HI> or horns, of the roebuck.
This variety, if it exi&s;ts, is only individual, and
probably appears in &s;uch places alone where the
hare cannot find herbage, and is obliged to feed
upon woody &s;ub&s;tances, as the bark, buds, and
leaves of trees, &amp;c.</P>
<P>The elk, who&s;e &s;pecies is confined to the nor|thern
regions of both Continents, is only &s;mal|ler
in America than in Europe; and we &s;ee,
from the enormous horns found under the
ground in Canada, Ru&s;&s;ia, Siberia, &amp;c. that
the&s;e animals were formerly much larger than
they are at pre&s;ent. This difference of &s;ize was
perhaps owing to the perfect tranquillity they
enjoyed in their fore&s;ts; and, as man had not
yet penetrated into the&s;e climates, they had it in
<PB N="413" REF="485">
their power to choo&s;e their abode in tho&s;e places
where the air, the &s;oil, and the water, were mo&s;t
agreeable to them. The rain-deer, which the
Laplanders have rendered dome&s;tic, is, for this
rea&s;on, more changed than the elk, which has
never been reduced to &s;lavery. The wild rain-deer
are larger and &s;tronger, and have blacker
hair than the dome&s;tic kind. The latter have
varied in the colour of the hair, and likewi&s;e in
the &s;ize of the horns. The rain-deer liverwort,
which con&s;titutes the chief food of the&s;e ani|mals,
&s;eems to contribute greatly, by its nutri|tive
quality, to the growth of the horns, which
are proportionally larger in the rain-deer than
in any other &s;pecies. It is, perhaps, the &s;ame
aliment which, in this climate, produces horns
in the head of the hare, as well as in that of the
female rain-deer; for, in all other climates, there
are no horned hares, nor any animal of which
the female carries horns as well as the male.</P>
<P>The elephant is the only quadruped upon
whom the dome&s;tic &s;tate has no influence; be|cau&s;e,
in this &s;tate, he refu&s;es to propagate, and,
of cour&s;e, tran&s;mits not to his &s;pecies the wounds
or defects occa&s;ioned by his unnatural condi|tion.
In the elephant, there are only &s;light, and
almo&s;t individual varieties. His natural colour
is black; &s;ome of them, however, are red, and
others white; but their number is exceedingly
&s;mall. The elephant likewi&s;e varies in &s;ize,
according to the longitude, or rather the lati|tude
<PB N="414" REF="486">
of the climate. Under the Torrid Zone,
to which he is entirely confined, he ri&s;es to fif|teen
feet high in the ea&s;tern parts of Africa;
while, in the we&s;tern regions of the &s;ame country,
he attains not above ten or eleven feet; which
is a proof that, though great heat be nece&s;&s;ary to
the full development of his body, exce&s;&s;ive heat
re&s;trains and reduces it to &s;maller dimen&s;ions.
The magnitude of the rhinoceros is more uni|form;
and he &s;eems to differ from him&s;elf on|ly
by that &s;ingular character which di&s;tingui&s;hes
him from all other animals, namely, the large
horn on his no&s;e. This horn is &s;ingle in the
A&s;iatic rhinoceros, and double in the African.</P>
<P>I decline mentioning the varieties which hap|pen
in every &s;pecies of carnivorous animals;
becau&s;e they are extremely &s;light; and, of all
quadrupeds, tho&s;e which feed upon fle&s;h are
mo&s;t independent of man; and, by means of
this nouri&s;hment, already concocted by Nature,
they receive almo&s;t none of the qualities of the
&s;oil which they inhabit. Be&s;ides, being all en|dowed
with &s;trength and weapons, they have
the choice of &s;oil and climate in their own op|tion;
and, con&s;equently, the three cau&s;es of
change or degeneration, formerly a&s;&s;igned, mu&s;t
have very little effect upon them.</P>
<P>After this &s;light &s;urvey of the variations pe|culiar
to each &s;pecies, let us next attend to the
more important change of the &s;pecies them&s;elves.
This is the mo&s;t antient degeneration; and it
<PB N="415" REF="487">
&s;eems to have taken place in each family, or in
each genus, under which the contiguous &s;pecies
may be comprehended. Of all terre&s;trial ani|mals,
there are only &s;ome detached &s;pecies, which,
like that of man, con&s;titute, at the &s;ame time,
both genus and &s;pecies. The elephant, the rhi|noceros,
the hippopotamus, and the giraffe,
form genera, or &s;imple &s;pecies, which propagate
in a direct line only, and have no collateral
branches. All the others appear to con&s;titute
families, in which a principal and common
trunk is generally to be recogni&s;ed, and from
which different branches ari&s;e, who&s;e numbers
are proportioned to the barrenne&s;s or fertility of
the individuals in each &s;pecies.</P>
<P>Under this point of view, the hor&s;e, the zebra,
and the a&s;s, are all of the &s;ame family. If the
hor&s;e is the principal trunk, the zebra and the
a&s;s are collateral branches. The number of
their re&s;emblances being infinitely greater than
that of their differences, they may be regarded
as con&s;tituting but one genus, of which the chief
characters are apparent, and common to the
whole tree. They alone are whole-hoofed,
without any appearance of toes or claws.
Though they form three di&s;tinct &s;pecies, they
are not ab&s;olutely &s;eparated, &s;ince the jack-a&s;s
produces with the mare, and the hor&s;e with the
&s;he-a&s;s; and it is probable, that, if the zebra
were tamed, he would likewi&s;e produce with
the mare and a&s;s.</P>

The mule, which has always been con&s;idered
as a vitiated production, as a mon&s;ter compo&s;ed
of two natures, and for that rea&s;on has been
thought to be incapable of reproduction, is not,
however, &s;o deeply injured as has been blindly
imagined; for it is not ab&s;olutely barren, and its
&s;terility depends on certain external and pecu|liar
circum&s;tances. Mules, it is well known,
frequently produce in warm countries; and
there are &s;ome examples of their producing
even in our temperate climates. But we know
not whether this generation ever proceeds from
the &s;imple union of a male and female mule, or
of a mule with a mare, or of a jack-a&s;s with a
mule. There are two kinds of mules; the com|mon
large mule which proceeds from the junc|tion
of a jack-a&s;s with a mare, and the &s;mall
mule, proceeding from the hor&s;e and the &s;he-a&s;s,
which we &s;hall di&s;tingui&s;h by the name of
<HI>bardeau.</HI> Both kinds were known to the an|tients:

<PB N="417" REF="489">
&s;he-mule ea&s;ily conceived, but &s;eldom brought
the foetus to maturity; and that, though exam|ples
of mules bringing forth were pretty fre|quent,
yet &s;uch productions were always re|garded
as prodigies. But is not a prodigy in
Nature only an effect more rare than &s;ome o|thers?
Thus we &s;ee that, in certain circum&s;tan|ces,
the mule can generate, and the &s;he-mule
conceive and bring forth. Hence nothing but
experiments are wanting to di&s;cover the&s;e cir|cum&s;tances,
and to acquire new facts concerning
generation by the commixture of &s;pecies, and,
of cour&s;e, concerning the unity or diver&s;ity of
each genus. To &s;ucceed in the&s;e experiments,
the he-mule mu&s;t be joined with a &s;he-mule,
with a mare, and with a &s;he-a&s;s: The &s;ame pro|ce&s;s
mu&s;t be ob&s;erved with regard to the bar|deau;
and the re&s;ults of the&s;e &s;ix copulations
ought to be carefully marked. The female a&s;s,
mule, and bardeau, &s;hould likewi&s;e be &s;erved
with a hor&s;e. The&s;e experiments, though &s;im|ple,
have never been tried with a view to ex|plain
the nature of generation. I regret that it
has never been in my power to execute them;
but I &s;hall hazard the following conjectures on
what would probably be their re&s;ults. I ima|gine,
for example, that, of all the&s;e junctions,
that of the he-mule and female bardeau, and
<PB N="418" REF="490">
that of the male bardeau and &s;he-mule, would
be ab&s;olutely abortive; that the junction of the
he and &s;he mule, and that of the male and fe|male
bardeau, might perhaps &s;ucceed, though
rarely; that the he-mule would produce more
certainly with the mare than with the &s;he-a&s;s,
and the mule bardeau more certainly with the
&s;he-a&s;s than with the mare; and, in fine, that
the hor&s;e and jack-a&s;s might perhaps produce
with both the &s;he-mules, but that the a&s;s would
be more &s;ucce&s;sful than the hor&s;e. The&s;e trials
&s;hould be made in a country as warm, at lea&s;t,
as the &s;outh of France; and the mules &s;hould be
&s;even, the hor&s;es five, and the a&s;&s;es four years
old; becau&s;e the&s;e different periods are nece&s;&s;ary
before the three animals acquire their full vi|gour.</P>
<P>I now give the analogical rea&s;oning upon
which the&s;e conjectures are founded. In the
common order of nature, it is not the males,
but the females, which con&s;titute the unity of
&s;pecies. We know, from the example of the
&s;heep, which can admit two different males, and
be equally fertile with the ram or the he-goat,
tha the female has much more influence upon
the &s;pecific qualities of the produce than the
male; &s;ince, from the&s;e two different males,
lambs only, or individuals &s;pecifically the &s;ame
with the mother, are propagated. Thus the
mule has a greater re&s;emblance to the mare than
to the a&s;s, and the bardeau to the &s;he-a&s;s than
<PB N="419" REF="491">
to the hor&s;e. Hence <HI>the mule ought to produce
more certainly with the mare than with the &s;he-a&s;s,
and the bardeau more certainly with the &s;he|a&s;s
than with the mare.</HI> In the &s;ame manner,
the hor&s;e and jack-a&s;s <HI>would probably produce
with both the &s;he-mules;</HI> becau&s;e, being females,
though vitiated, each retains more &s;pecific quali|ties
than the male mules: <HI>But the jack-a&s;s &s;hould
produce with them more certainly than the hor&s;e;</HI>
becau&s;e the jack-a&s;s has been ob&s;erved to po&s;&s;e&s;s
&s;tronger prolific powers, even when joined with
a mare, than the hor&s;e; for the former corrupts
or de&s;troys what had been done by the latter.
Of this fact we may be a&s;&s;ured by fir&s;t &s;erving
mares with a &s;tallion, and next day, or even
&s;ome days after, with a jack-a&s;s. Mares ma|naged
in this manner almo&s;t con&s;tantly produce
mules, and not hor&s;es. This fact, every circum|&s;tance
of which merits attention, &s;eems to indi|cate
that the a&s;s, and not the hor&s;e, is the prin|cipal
&s;tock of this family; &s;ince the prolific
powers of the a&s;s prevail even with mares, e&s;pe|cially
as the rever&s;e does not take place when
the a&s;s precedes the hor&s;e. The latter de&s;troys
not the generation of the a&s;s; for the pro|duce
is almo&s;t always a mule. On the other
hand, the &s;ame thing does not take place, when
the jack-a&s;s precedes the hor&s;e with a &s;he-a&s;s;
for the latter de&s;troys not the operation of the
former. With regard to the copulation of mules
among them&s;elves, I have pre&s;umed it to be &s;te|rile;
<PB N="420" REF="492">
becau&s;e, from two temperaments, already
vitiated in the article of generation, and which,
from their union, mu&s;t be &s;till farther injured, a
produce either totally vitiated, or ab&s;olute bar|renne&s;s,
is to be expected.</P>
<P>By the mixture of the mule with the mare,
of the bardeau with the &s;he-a&s;s, and of the hor&s;e
and jack-a&s;s with &s;he-mules, individuals might
be obtained which would a&s;cend toward the o|riginal
&s;pecies, and would be only half mules.
The&s;e, like their parents, would not only po&s;&s;e&s;s
the power of engendering with tho&s;e of their
primitive &s;pecies, but perhaps of producing a|mong
them&s;elves; becau&s;e, being only half vi|tiated,
their produce would not be more vitiated
than the fir&s;t mules: And, if the&s;e half mules
were &s;till barren, or their off&s;pring rare, it is al|mo&s;t
certain, that, by making them approach
another degree toward their original &s;pecies, the
individuals which, re&s;ulting from their union,
being only vitiated one fourth, would produce
among them&s;elves, and form a new &s;tem, which
would neither be preci&s;ely that of the hor&s;e, nor
that of the a&s;s. Now, as every thing that can
happen has been accompli&s;hed in time, and ei|ther
exi&s;ts or has exi&s;ted in Nature, I am in|clined
to think, that the fertile mule mentioned
by the antients, and which, in the days of A|ri&s;totle,
exi&s;ted in the territories of Syria, above
Phoenicia, might be a race of the&s;e half or quar|tern
mules, which had been produced by the
<PB N="421" REF="493">
commixtures we have ju&s;t now de&s;cribed; for
Ari&s;totle &s;ays in expre&s;s terms, that the&s;e fertile
mules were perfectly &s;imilar to the barren kind<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">In terra Syria &s;uper Phoenicem mulae et coeunt et pari|unt; &s;ed id genus diver&s;um quanquam &s;imile; <HI>Ari&s;t. hi&s;t. anim. lib. 6. cap.</HI> 24.&mdash;Sunt in Syria quos mulos appellant genus diver&s;um ab eo quod coitu equae et a&s;ini procreatur: Sed &s;imile facie, quomodo a&s;ini &s;ylve&s;tres &s;imilitudine quadam nomen urbanorum accepere; et quidem ut a&s;ini illi feri &s;ic muli prae&s;tant celeritate.

He clearly di&s;tingui&s;hes them from the <HI>onagri,</HI>
or wild a&s;&s;es, which he mentions in the &s;ame
chapter; and, con&s;equently, tho&s;e animals can
only be referred to the mules which have &s;uf|fered
little vitiation, and pre&s;erved their gene|rative
powers. The <HI>czigithai,</HI> or fertile mule of
Tartary, it is probable, was not the onager or
wild a&s;s, but this &s;ame Phoenician mule, who&s;e
race, perhaps, &s;till remains. The fir&s;t traveller
who compares them, will confirm or de&s;troy
this conjecture. Even the zebra, which has a
greater re&s;emblance to the hor&s;e than to the a&s;s,
might have a &s;imilar origin. The con&s;trained
regularity of his colours, which are di&s;po&s;ed in
alternate bands of black and white, &s;eems to in|dicate
that they proceed from two different &s;pe|cies,
which, in their mixture, have &s;eparated as
much as po&s;&s;ible; for none of the operations of
Nature is &s;o abrupt, and &s;o little &s;haded, as the
<PB N="422" REF="494">
coat of the zebra, where &s;he pa&s;&s;es quickly and
alternately from white to black, and from black
to white, without any intermediate &s;tep, through
the whole extent of the animal's body.</P>
<P>However this matter &s;tands, it is certain, from
what is above remarked, that mules, in general,
which have uniformly been accu&s;ed of &s;terility,
are neither really nor univer&s;ally barren; and
that this &s;terility is particularly apparent only in
the mule which proceeds from the a&s;s and hor&s;e;
for the mule produced by the he-goat and the
ewe is equally fertile as its parents; and mo&s;t of
the mules produced by different &s;pecies of birds
are not barren. It is, therefore, in the particu|lar
nature of the hor&s;e and a&s;s that we mu&s;t
&s;earch for the cau&s;es of the &s;terility of the mules
which proceed from their union; and, in&s;tead of
&s;uppo&s;ing barrenne&s;s to be a general and nece&s;|&s;ary
defect common to all mules, it &s;hould be
limited to the mule produced by the a&s;s and
hor&s;e; and even this limitation ought to be re|&s;tricted,
as the&s;e &s;ame mules, in certain circum|&s;tances,
become fertile, particularly when brought
a degree nearer to their original &s;pecies.</P>
<P>The mules produced by the hor&s;e and a&s;s
have their organs of generation as complete as
other animals. Nothing &s;eems to be defective
either in the male or female. The &s;eminal
fluid of the male is copious; and, as he is not
permitted to copulate, he is often &s;o pre&s;&s;ed for
a di&s;charge, that he lies down on his belly, in
<PB N="423" REF="495">
order to produce a colli&s;ion on his fore legs,
which are folded under his brea&s;t. The&s;e ani|mals,
therefore, are furni&s;hed with every thing
nece&s;&s;ary to the act of generation. They are
even extremely ardent, and, con&s;equently, very
indifferent in their choice. The males have
nearly the &s;ame vehemence of de&s;ire for the fe|male
mule, the &s;he-a&s;s, and the mare. Hence
there is no difficulty of procuring copulations;
but, to render the&s;e prolific, particular attentions
are nece&s;&s;ary. Too much ardour, e&s;pecially in
the females, is generally followed with &s;terility;
and the female mule is at lea&s;t as ardent as the
&s;he-a&s;s. Now, we know that the latter rejects
the &s;eminal fluid of the male, and that, to make
her retain it and conceive, &s;he mu&s;t have blows,
or water thrown on her crupper, in order to
calm the convul&s;ive emotions of de&s;ire which
&s;ub&s;i&s;t after copulation, and are the cau&s;e of this
rejection. The &s;he-a&s;s and female mule, there|fore,
by their too great ardour, have both a
tendency to barrenne&s;s. This tendency is in|crea&s;ed
by another cau&s;e: As the&s;e animals are
originally natives of warm climates, cold is an
ob&s;tacle to their propagation; and, for this rea|&s;on,
they are only allowed to copulate in &s;um|mer.
When their union is permitted at any
other time, and particularly in winter, it &s;eldom
produces impregnation. The &s;ea&s;on nece&s;&s;ary
to the &s;ucce&s;s of their generation is equally &s;o to
the pre&s;ervation of their young. The colt mu&s;t
<PB N="424" REF="496">
be brought forth when the &s;ea&s;on is warm,
otherwi&s;e it either langui&s;hes or dies: And, as
the &s;he-a&s;s goes one year with young, &s;he brings
forth in the &s;ame &s;ea&s;on that &s;he conceives. This
is a &s;ufficient proof that heat is nece&s;&s;ary not
only to the fecundity of the&s;e animals, but to
the vigour of their bodies. On account of the
great ardour of the female, &s;he is &s;erved with a
male almo&s;t immediately after &s;he brings forth.
She is not allowed above &s;even or eight days of
repo&s;e between delivery and copulation. Weaken|ed
by the birth, &s;he is then le&s;s ardent, the parts
have not had time &s;ufficient to re&s;ume their for|mer
ten&s;ion; and, of cour&s;e, conception is more
certain than when &s;he is in full vigour and ar|dour.
In this &s;pecies, as in that of the cat, the
temperament of the female is &s;aid to be much
more ardent than that of the male. The jack|a&s;s,
however, is remarkable for vigour. He
can cover females &s;everal times a day &s;ucce&s;|&s;ively.
He has been known to go to &s;uch
exce&s;s, without any other incitement than na|tural
appetite, as to die on the &s;pot, after eleven
or twelve efforts, repeated almo&s;t without inter|val;
and, to &s;upport this great wa&s;te, he took
nothing but a few draughts of water. This
flame which con&s;umes him is too vivid to be
durable: An a&s;s &s;tallion is &s;oon unfit either for
propagation or &s;ervice; and this, perhaps, is the
rea&s;on why the female has been &s;aid to have
more &s;trength, and to live longer than the male.
<PB N="425" REF="497">
It is certain, that, with the management former|ly
recommended, &s;he can live thirty years, and
bring forth annually during her whole life.
But the male, when not re&s;trained from females,
abu&s;es his &s;trength to &s;uch a degree, that, in a
few years, he lo&s;es the power of engendering.</P>
<P>Hence both the male and female a&s;&s;es have a
tendency to &s;terility by common, and likewi&s;e
by different qualities. The hor&s;e and mare have
the &s;ame tendency. The &s;tallion may be given
to the mare nine or ten days after &s;he has
brought forth, and &s;he can produce five or &s;ix
years in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion; but, after the period, &s;he
becomes barren. To &s;upport her fecundity, &s;he
&s;hould be allowed an interval of a year between
each birth, and treated differently from the &s;he|a&s;s.
In&s;tead of giving her the &s;tallion &s;oon af|ter
delivery, &s;he &s;hould be re&s;trained from him
till the following year, and till her ardour is
manife&s;ted by the fluids &s;he ejects. Even with
the&s;e precautions, &s;he &s;eldom retains her fertili|ty
beyond the age of twenty-five years. On
the other hand, the hor&s;e, though le&s;s ardent and
more delicate than the jack-a&s;s, pre&s;erves the
faculty of propagating much longer. I have
known old hor&s;es, who were unable to mount
the mare without the aid of the groom, re&s;ume
their vigour when properly placed, and engender
at the age of thirty years. In the hor&s;e, the &s;emi|nal
fluid is not only le&s;s abundant, but le&s;s &s;timu|lant
than in the jack-a&s;s; for the hor&s;e often co|pulates
<PB N="426" REF="498">
without ejection, e&s;pecially when the mare
is pre&s;ented to him before he di&s;covers any in|clination.
After enjoyment, he appears to be
melancholy; and a con&s;iderable interval is ne|ce&s;&s;ary
for re&s;uming his ardour. Be&s;ides, his mo&s;t
vigorous efforts are not always &s;ucce&s;sful. Some
mares are naturally barren, and a greater num|ber
of them po&s;&s;e&s;s very little fertility. There
are likewi&s;e &s;tallions, which, though apparently
vigorous, have very little power. To the&s;e par|ticular
rea&s;ons, we can add a more evident and
a more general proof of the &s;mall degree of fer|tility
in the hor&s;e and a&s;s: Of all dome&s;tic ani|mals,
though mo&s;t attention is be&s;towed on them,
they are the lea&s;t numerous. In the ox, the
&s;heep, the goat, and particularly the hog, the
dog, and the cat, the individuals are ten, and
perhaps a hundred times more numerous than
tho&s;e of the hor&s;e and a&s;s. Thus their defec|tivene&s;s
in fecundity is proved by the facts; and
to all the&s;e cau&s;es, the &s;terlity of mules, which
are produced by the union of tho&s;e naturally
unprolific &s;pecies, ought to be a&s;cribed. In tho&s;e
&s;pecies, on the contrary, which, like the &s;heep
and goat, are numerous, and con&s;equently pro|lific,
the mules proceeding from their intermix|ture
are not barren, but a&s;cend to the orignal
&s;pecies in the fir&s;t generation. But it would re|quire
two, three, and perhaps four generations,
to enable the mule produced by the union of
<PB N="427" REF="499">
the hor&s;e and a&s;s to arrive at the &s;ame degree of
re-e&s;tabli&s;hment of its nature.</P>
<P>Another kind of mule has been &s;aid to have
re&s;ulted from the copulation of the bull and
mare. Columella, I believe, is the fir&s;t who
mentions it. Ge&s;ner quotes him, and adds, that
the&s;e mules are found near Grenoble, and are
called, in French, <HI>jumars.</HI> I had one of the&s;e
jumars brought to me from Dauphiny, and ano|ther
from the Pyrenees; and I di&s;covered, both
from in&s;pecting their external figure, and di&s;|&s;ecting
their internal parts, that the&s;e jumars
were nothing but bardeaus, or mules produced
between the hor&s;e and &s;he-a&s;s. Hence I am led
to conclude, both from this experiment, and
from analogy, that this kind of mule has no
exi&s;tence, and that the word <HI>jumar</HI> is a chime|rical
name, without any real object. The na|ture
of the bull is too remote from that of the
mare to permit their producing together; the
one having four &s;tomachs, horns, cloven feet,
&amp;c. and the other being whole hoofed, hornle&s;s,
and having but one &s;tomach. The organs of ge|neration
are likewi&s;e &s;o very different, both in
&s;ize and proportions, that there is no rea&s;on for
&s;uppo&s;ing that they could unite either with plea|&s;ure
or &s;ucce&s;s. If the bull were to produce
with any other &s;pecies than his own, it would
be with the buffalo, which re&s;embles him in
&s;tructure as well as in natural habits; yet we
have never heard of mules produced by the&s;e
<PB N="428" REF="500">
two animals, though they are often found in
the &s;ame places, either in a dome&s;tic or a free
&s;tate. What is related concerning the fertile in|tercour&s;e
of the &s;tag and cow, appears to be e|qually
&s;u&s;picious as the hi&s;tory of the jumars,
though the &s;tag, by his conformation, is not &s;o
far removed from the nature of the cow as the
bull is from that of the mare.</P>
<P>The deer-kind, who have <HI>wood</HI> in&s;tead of
horns, and though they chew the cud, and have
the &s;ame internal &s;tructure with tho&s;e animals
who have horns, &s;eem to con&s;titute a &s;eparate
family, of which the elk is the large&s;t &s;tem, and
the rain-deer, the &s;tag, the axis, the fallow-deer,
and the roebuck, are &s;maller and collateral bran|ches;
for there are only &s;ix &s;pecies of quadru|peds,
who&s;e head is armed with branched horns,
which fall off and are renewed every year: In|dependent
of this generic character, which is
common to the whole, they re&s;emble each other
&s;till more in &s;tructure and natural habits. We
&s;hould, therefore, rather expect mules from a
commixture of the &s;tag or fallow-deer with the
axis or rain-deer, than from that of the &s;tag
with the cow.</P>
<P>We have &s;till greater rea&s;on to regard all the
&s;heep and all the goats as con&s;tituting the &s;ame
family; becau&s;e they produce together mules,
which a&s;cend directly, and in the fir&s;t genera|tion,
to the &s;pecies of the &s;heep. To this nu|merous
family of &s;heep and goats, we might add
<PB N="429" REF="501">
tho&s;e of the gazelles and bubalus, which are not
le&s;s numerous. In this genus, which compre|hends
more than thirty &s;pecies, it appears that
the mouflon, the wild goat, the chamois goat,
the antilope, the bubalus, the condoma, &amp;c.
are principal &s;tems, and that the others are on|ly
acce&s;&s;ory branches, who have all retained the
chief characters of the &s;tems from which they
i&s;&s;ued; but, at the &s;ame time, they have been
prodigiou&s;ly varied by the influences of climate,
food, and a &s;tate of &s;ervitude, to which man has
reduced mo&s;t of the&s;e animals.</P>
<P>The dog, the wolf, the fox, the jackal, and
the i&s;atis, form another genus, the different &s;pe|cies
of which are &s;o &s;imilar, particularly in
their internal &s;tructure and the organs of gene|ration,
that it is difficult to conceive why they
do not intermix. From the experiments I made,
with regard to the union of the dog with the
wolf and fox, the repugnance to copulation
&s;eemed to proceed rather from the wolf than the
dog, that is, from the wild, and not from the
dome&s;tic animal; for the bitches which I put
to the trial would have willingly permitted the
fox and wolf; but the &s;he-wolf and female fox
would never &s;uffer the approaches of the dog.
The dome&s;tic &s;tate &s;eems to render animals le&s;s
faithful to their &s;pecies. It likewi&s;e makes them
more ardent and more fertile: The bitch gene|rally
produces twice in a year: But the &s;he-wolf
and the female fox produce only once in
<PB N="430" REF="502">
the &s;ame period: And, it is probable, that the
dogs who have become wild and have multi|plied
in the i&s;land of Juan Fernandez, and in
the mountains of St Domingo, produce but once
a year, like the fox and wolf. Were this fact
a&s;certained, it would fully e&s;tabli&s;h the unity of
genus in the&s;e three animals, who re&s;emble each
other &s;o much in &s;tructure, that their repugnance
to intermixing mu&s;t be &s;olely a&s;cribed to &s;ome
external circum&s;tances.</P>
<P>The dog &s;eems to be an intermediate &s;pecies
between the fox and wolf. The antients affirm,
that, in certain circum&s;tances, and in particu|lar
countries, the dog produces with the wolf
and fox<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">In Cyrenen&s;i agro lupi cum canibus coeunt, et <HI>Laconici</HI> canes ex vulpe et cane generantur; <HI>Ari&s;t. bi&s;t. anim. lib. 8. cap.</HI> 28....

I endeavoured to a&s;certain this fact;
and, though I did not &s;ucceed, we mu&s;t not
conclude it to be impo&s;&s;ible; for my experi|ments
were confined to captive animals; and it
is well known, that, in &s;ome &s;pecies, captivity
alone is &s;ufficient to extingui&s;h the de&s;ire, and
to create a repugnance to copulation, even with
their equals. This &s;tate of re&s;traint, therefore,
ought to have a &s;till greater effect in preventing
their union with individuals of a different &s;pe|cies.
<PB N="431" REF="503">
But I am per&s;uaded, that the dog, when
at liberty and deprived of his own female, might
intermix with the wolf and fox, e&s;pecially af|ter
he had become wild, lo&s;t the odour of a do|me&s;tic
&s;tate, and approached the&s;e animals in
their natural manner and habits. I believe not,
however, that the fox and wolf ever unite;
&s;ince they both live in the &s;ame climates, with|out
attempting to intermix. If ever, therefore,
they belonged to the &s;ame &s;pecies, their dege|neration
mu&s;t be referred to a period beyond the
records of hi&s;tory. This is the rea&s;on why I
a&s;&s;erted, that the dog was an intermediate &s;pe|cies
between the fox and wolf: His &s;pecies is
al&s;o common, &s;ince he is capable of uniting with
both. And, if any circum&s;tance could &s;how
that the&s;e three animals proceeded originally
from the &s;ame &s;tock, it is the common relation
between the dog and the fox and wolf, which
brings the &s;pecies nearer each other than all the
&s;imilarities in their figure and organization. To
reduce the fox and wolf, therefore, to one &s;pe|cies,
we mu&s;t a&s;cend to a &s;tate of nature in a
very remote period of antiquity. But, in their
actual condition, the wolf and fox mu&s;t be re|garded
as the chief &s;tems in the genus of the
five animals under con&s;ideration. The dog, the
jackal, and the i&s;atis, are only lateral branches
&s;ituated between the two fir&s;t. The jackal par|ticipates
of the dog and wolf, and the i&s;atis of
the jackal and fox. It likewi&s;e appears, from
<PB N="432" REF="504">
a great number of authorities, that the jackal
and dog ea&s;ily produce together; and we per|ceive,
from the de&s;cription and hi&s;tory of the i|&s;atis,
that he re&s;embles the fox almo&s;t entirely
in figure and temperament; that they equally
frequent cold countries; but that he, at the &s;ame
time, has the natural, di&s;po&s;itions of the jackal,
the continual barking, the clamorous voice,
and the habit of going always in packs.</P>
<P>The &s;hepherd's dog, which I con&s;ider as the
original &s;tem of all dogs, makes, at the &s;ame time,
the neare&s;t approach to the fox in figure. His
&s;ize is the &s;ame, and, like the fox, he has erect
ears, a pointed muzzle, and a &s;traight, trailing
tail. He likewi&s;e re&s;embles the fox in voice,
&s;agacity, and &s;ubtlety of in&s;tinct. Hence this dog
may have originally proceeded from the fox,
if not in a direct, at lea&s;t in a collateral line.
The dog that Ari&s;totle calls <HI>canis laconicus,</HI>
and which he a&s;&s;ures us is produced from a
mixture of the fox and dog, may be the &s;ame
with the &s;hepherd's dog; or, at lea&s;t, it has
a greater affinity to him than to any other
dog. It is natural to imagine, that the epithet
<HI>laconicus,</HI> which Ari&s;totle does not explain, was
given to this dog, becau&s;e he was found in Laconia,
a province of Greece. But, if we attend to the o|rigin
of this <HI>laconic</HI> dog, we will perceive, that
the race was not limited to the country of Laco|nia
alone, but mu&s;t have been equally common
<PB N="433" REF="505">
in all countries inhabited by foxes. This cir|cum&s;tance
induces me to think, that Ari&s;totle
employed the epithet <HI>laconicus</HI> to expre&s;s the
brevity and acutene&s;s of the animal's voice; be|cau&s;e
he did not bark like other dogs, but yelp|ed
like a fox. Now, our &s;hepherd's dog is be&s;t
entitled to the denomination of <HI>laconic;</HI> for, of
all dogs, his voice is &s;harpe&s;t and mo&s;t &s;eldom
employed. Be&s;ides, the characters a&s;cribed by A|ri&s;totle
to this <HI>laconic</HI> dog corre&s;pond very well
with tho&s;e of the &s;hepherd's dog; and this cir|cum&s;tance
contributes &s;till farther to convince
me that they were the &s;ame. That the reader
may judge whether my conjecture is properly
founded, I have in&s;erted the entire pa&s;&s;age of
Ari&s;totle in the margin<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot"><P>Laconici canes ex Vulpe et Cane generantur; <HI>Hi&s;t. anim. lib. 8. cap.</HI> 28.&mdash;Canum genera plura &s;unt.

<P>By the word <HI>genus</HI> Ari&s;totle means <HI>race.</HI> He di&s;tingui&s;hes three races of dogs, the <HI>Laconious,</HI> the <HI>Moloticus,</HI> and the <HI>Pe|cuarius.</HI> The <HI>Moloticus,</HI> which he likewi&s;e calls <HI>Venaticus,</HI> is probably our grey-hound, which in Greece and A&s;ia-Minor is the common hunting dog. The <HI>Pecuarius,</HI> which he &s;ays greatly exceeds all other dogs in magnitude, is unque&s;tion|ably the ma&s;tiff, and is u&s;ed for defending the cattle from ferocious animals. The <HI>Laconious,</HI> to which he a&s;&s;igns no employment, and only remarks, that it is a dog of great in|du&s;try and labour, and that it is &s;maller than the <HI>Pecuarius,</HI> can be nothing el&s;e than the &s;hepherd's dog, which is very laborious in arranging, re&s;training, and conducting the &s;heep, and is more indu&s;trious and attentive than any other dog. But the greate&s;t difficulty in the&s;e pa&s;&s;ages quoted from Ari|&s;totle con&s;i&s;ts in the different periods of ge&s;tation which he a&s;cribes to the different races of dogs. Some of them, he &s;ays, go with young two months, others two months and a half, and others three months; for all our dogs, of whatever race, go with young about nine weeks, or from &s;ixty-one to &s;ixty-three days; and I know not if ever a greater difference in the time of ge&s;tation has been ob&s;erved than three or four days. But Ari&s;totle might be more &s;killed in this &s;ubject than we are. And, if the facts he advances be true, certain dogs mu&s;t have a greater affinity with the wolf than others; for we are a&s;&s;ured by the hunters, that the wolf goes with young three months, or three months and a half.</P></NOTE>.</P>

The genus of cruel and rapacious animals is

<PB N="435" REF="507">
Evil here, as well as el&s;ewhere, a&s;&s;umes every

others, as the panther, the ounce, the leopard,
the lynx, the caracal, the jaguar, the couguar,
the ocelot, the &s;erval, the margai, and the cat,
con&s;titute but one &s;anguinary family, the dif|ferent
branches of which are more or le&s;s ex|tended
and diver&s;i&s;ied, according to the difference
of climates. All the&s;e animals, though very
different in magnitude and figure, re&s;emble each
other in their natural di&s;po&s;itions. They all
have fiery eyes, &s;hort muzzles, and &s;harp, crook|ed,
and retractile claws. They are all de&s;truc|tive,
ferocious, and untameable. The cat,
which is the lea&s;t and &s;malle&s;t &s;pecies, though
reduced to &s;lavery, is neither le&s;s perfidious, nor
more obedient. The wild cat has pre&s;erved
the character of the family. He is equally
cruel, mi&s;chievous, and depredatory, as his lar|ger
kindred. They are all equally carnivorous,
and enemies to the other animals. Man, with
all his powers, has never been able to de&s;troy
them. He has at all times employed again&s;t
<PB N="436" REF="508">
them fire, &s;teel, poi&s;on, and &s;nares. But, as
all the individuals are very prolific, and the
&s;pecies numerous, the efforts of man have been
limited to bani&s;hing and confining them in the
de&s;erts, from which they never i&s;&s;ue without
marking their paths with terror and with blood.
A &s;ingle tiger e&s;caping from the fore&s;t, alarms a
whole people, and obliges them to take up arms:
How dreadful would be the con&s;equences, if
the&s;e &s;anguinary animals went in troops, and, like
the wild dogs and jackals, extended their projects
of depredation? Nature has be&s;towed this in|telligence
upon timid animals; but has happily
denied it to the bold and &s;olitary tribes. They
always travel alone, and confide &s;olely in their
courage and &s;trength. It had not e&s;caped the
ob&s;ervation of Ari&s;totle, that no animal po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed
of crooked and retractile claws was &s;ocial, or went
in troops<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Nullum animal, cui ungues adunci, gregatile e&s;&s;e perpen|dimus; <HI>Ari&s;t. hi&s;t. anim. lib. 1. cap.</HI> 1.</NOTE>. This remark, which then applied

1. The whole-hoofed genus properly &s;o called,
which comprehends the hor&s;e, the zebra, and
the a&s;s, together with the fertile and unfertile
mules. 2. The large cloven-hoofed, with hol|low
horns, as the ox, and the buffalo, with all
their varieties. 3. The &s;mall cloven-hoofed,
with hollow horns, as the &s;heep, the goat, the
gazelle, the antilope, and all the other &s;pecies
which participate of their nature. 4. The cloven
hoofed, with &s;olid horns, which fall off and are
renewed every year. This family comprehends
the elk, the rain-deer, the &s;tag, the fallow-deer,
the axis, and the roebuck. 5. The ambiguous
cloven-hoofed, which is compo&s;ed of the wild
boar, and all the other varieties of the hog, as
the hog of Siam with a pendulous belly;
that of Guiney, with long pointed ears lying
on the back; that of the Canaries, with long,
thick tu&s;ks, &amp;c. 6. The exten&s;ive genus of
digitated carnivorous animals, with crooked
and retractile claws, in which are comprehend|ed
the panther, leopard, ounce, &s;erval, and cat,
<PB N="438" REF="510">
with all their varieties. 7. Digitated, carnivo|rous
animals with &s;traight and fixed claws, under
which are comprehended the wolf, fox, jackal,
i&s;atis, and dog, with all their varieties. 8. Digitated
carnivorous animals with fixed claws, and a pouch
under the tail. This genus is compo&s;ed of the
hyaena, civet, zibet, genet, badger, &amp;c. 9. Di|gitated
carnivorous animals, with a very long
body, five toes on each foot, and the thumb
&s;eparated from the other toes. This genus
comprehends the martin, polecat, &s;able, ferret,
ichneumon, wea&s;el, van&s;ire, &amp;c. 10. The nu|merous
family of digitated quadrupeds, which
have two large cutting teeth in each jaw, and
no prickles on the body. This genus contains
the hare, the rabbit, and all the &s;pecies of &s;quir|rels,
dormice, marmots, and rats. 11. Digitated
quadrupeds with prickles on their body, as the
porcupines and hedge-hog. 12. Digitated ani|mals
covered with &s;cales, as the long-tailed and
&s;hort-tailed manis, or &s;caly lizards. 13. The
amphibious digitated genus, comprehending
the otter, beaver, mu&s;k-rats, walrus, and &s;eals.
14. The four-handed genus, which includes
the apes, baboons, monkeys, makis, loris, &amp;c.
15. La&s;tly, the winged quadrupeds, comprehend|ing
bats of all kinds.&mdash;The nine detached &s;pecies
are, the elephant, rhinoceros, hippopotamus,
giraffe, camel, lion, tiger, bear, and mole, which
are all &s;ubject to a greater or &s;maller number of
varieties.</P>
<P><PB N="439" REF="511">
Of the&s;e fifteen genera and nine detached
&s;pecies, &s;even genera and two &s;pecies are com|mon
to both Continents. The two &s;pecies are
the bear and mole. The &s;even genera are, 1.
The large cloven-hoofed, with hollow horns;
for the ox is found in America under the form
of the bi&s;on. 2. The cloven-hoofed, with &s;o|lid
horns; for the elk exi&s;ts in Canada under
the name of <HI>original,</HI> the rain-deer under that of
<HI>caribou,</HI> and &s;tags, fallow-deer, and roebucks,
are found in almo&s;t every province of North
America. 3. The digitated carnivorous qua|drupeds
with fixed claws; for the wolf and fox
are found in the New as well as in the Old
World. 4, The digitated long-bodied genus;
for the pine wea&s;el, martin, and polecat, are
found in America. 5. A part of the digitated
genus with two large cutting teeth in each jaw,
as the &s;quirrels, marmots, rats, &amp;c. are like|wi&s;e
found in America. 6. The digitated am|phibious
genus, as the walrus, &s;eal, beaver, and
otter, exi&s;ts in the northern regions of the New
Continent. 7. The digitated winged genus
likewi&s;e exi&s;ts in America; as the bat and vam|pire.</P>
<P>There remains, therefore, only eight genera
and five detached &s;pecies, which are peculiar to
the Old World: 1. The whole-hoofed genus
properly &s;o called; for neither hor&s;es, nor a&s;&s;es,
nor zebras, nor mules, were found in America.
2. The &s;mall cloven-hoofed genus with hollow
<PB N="440" REF="512">
horns; for &s;heep, goats, gazelles, and antilopes,
had no exi&s;tence in the New World. 3. The
hog-genus; for the &s;pecies of the wild boar ex|i&s;ts
not in America; and, though the pecari and
its varieties are related to this family, they dif|fer
in characters &s;o remarkable as to ju&s;tify their
&s;eparation. 4. The &s;ame remark is applicable
to the carnivorous animals with retractile claws;
and, though the jaguar, couguar, ocelot, and
margai appear to belong to this family, none of
the&s;e &s;pecies of the New World are found in the
Old, and none of tho&s;e of the Antient Continent
are found in the New. 5. The &s;ame remark is
applicable to the digitated quadrupeds, who&s;e
bodies are covered with prickles; for, though
the coendou and Canada porcupine make a near
approach to this genus, they differ widely from
the hedge-hogs and porcupines. 6. The digita|ted
carnivorous genus, with fixed claws; for the
hyaena, the civets, and the badgers, have no ex|i&s;tence
in America. 7. The four-handed genus;
for, in America, there are no apes, baboons,
monkeys, nor makis. The &s;apajous, the &s;agoins,
the opo&s;&s;ums, &amp;c. though likewi&s;e four-hand|ed,
differ e&s;&s;entially from tho&s;e of the Old Con|tinent.
8. The digitated genus who&s;e bodies
are covered with &s;cales; for none of the &s;caly
lizards are found in America; and the ant-eaters,
to which the former may be compared, are
covered with hair, and differ too much from
<PB N="441" REF="513">
the &s;caly lizards to be admitted into the &s;ame
family.</P>
<P>Of the nine detached &s;pecies, &s;even, namely,
the elephant, rhinoceros, hippopotamus, giraffe,
camel, lion, and tiger, are found only in the Old
World; and two, to wit, the bear and mole, are
common to both Continents.</P>
<P>If we make a &s;imilar enumeration of the ani|mals
peculiar to the New World, we &s;hall find,
that there are about fifteen different &s;pecies, which
may be reduced to ten genera, and four detach|ed
&s;pecies. The&s;e four &s;pecies are the tapir, the
cabiai, the lama, and the pecari: But the tapir
is properly the only &s;pecies which is ab&s;olutely
detached; for that of the pecari has varieties;
and the pacos may be united with the lama, and
the Guinea-pig with the cabiai. The ten genera
are, 1. Eight &s;pecies of &s;apajous. 2. Six &s;pecies
of &s;agoins. 3. The opo&s;&s;ums, phalangers, the
tar&s;iers, &amp;c. 4. The jaguars, couguars, ocelots,
margais, &amp;c. 5. Three or four &s;pecies of co|atis.
6. Four or five &s;pecies of mouffettes, or
&s;tinking wea&s;els. 7. The genus of agouti, com|prehending
the acouchi, the paca, the aperea, and
the tapeti, or Bra&s;ilian hare. 8. That of the
armadillos, which con&s;i&s;ts of &s;even or eight &s;pe|cies.
9. Two or three &s;pecies of ant-eaters.
10. Two &s;pecies of &s;loths.</P>
<P>The&s;e ten genera and four detached &s;pecies,
to which the animals peculiar to the New World
may be reduced, though they differ from tho&s;e
<PB N="442" REF="514">
of the Old Continent, have remote relations
which &s;eem to indicate &s;omething common in
their formation, and lead us to cau&s;es of dege|neration
more antient, perhaps, than all the o|thers.
We formerly made the general remark,
that all the animals of the New World were
much &s;maller than tho&s;e of the Old. This great
diminution in magnitude, whatever be the cau&s;e
of it, is a primary kind of degeneration, which
could not happen without having a con&s;iderable
influence on the figure of all the&s;e animals; and,
in comparing them, we mu&s;t not lo&s;e &s;ight of
this fir&s;t effect.</P>
<P>The large&s;t is the tapir, which, as he exceeds
not the &s;ize of an a&s;s, cannot be compared to the
elephant, rhinoceros, or hippopotamus. In the
New Continent, he is the large&s;t animal, as the
elephant is in the Old. Like the rhinoceros,
his upper lip is mu&s;cular and prominent; and,
like the hippopotamus, he frequents the water.
He alone repre&s;ents, in &s;ome degree, the&s;e three
animals; and his figure, which re&s;embles the
a&s;s more than that of any other quadruped, &s;eems
to be as much degraded as his &s;tatute is dimi|ni&s;hed.
The hor&s;e, the a&s;s, the zebra, the ele|phant,
the rhinoceros, and the hippopotamus, had
no exi&s;tence in America: Neither was there, in
this New World, any animal which could be com|pared
with them either for magnitude or figure.
The tapir &s;eems to be the lea&s;t remote from the
whole of the&s;e animals: But, at the &s;ame time,
<PB N="443" REF="515">
he is &s;o mixed, and approaches &s;o little to any
one of them, that it is impo&s;&s;ible to attribute his
origin to any particular &s;pecies: And, notwith|&s;tanding
the &s;light relations he has to the rhino|ceros,
the hippopotamus, and the a&s;s, he ought
to be regarded not only as a peculiar &s;pecies, but
even as a &s;ingular genus.</P>
<P>Hence the tapir is not even remotely allied to
any &s;pecies of the Old Continent, and has hard|ly
any characters which make him approach
tho&s;e animals to which we have been comparing
him. In the &s;ame manner, the cabiai has no ex|ternal
relation to any other animal, and he ap|proaches
the Guinea-pig, in his external parts
only, which belongs to the &s;ame Continent, and
both &s;pecies are ab&s;olutely different from all tho&s;e
of the Old World.</P>
<P>The lama and pacos &s;eem to po&s;&s;e&s;s more per|ceptible
marks of their antient lineage, the fir&s;t
with the camel, and the &s;econd with the &s;heep.
The lama, like the camel, has long legs, a very
long neck, a light head, and the upper lip divi|ded.
He likewi&s;e re&s;embles the camel in mild|ne&s;s
of di&s;po&s;ition, &s;ervility of &s;pirit, &s;obriety, and
aptne&s;s for labour. Among the Americans, he
was the fir&s;t and the mo&s;t u&s;eful of their dome|&s;tic
animals. He was employed, as the Arabs
u&s;e the camel, for carrying burdens. To
the&s;e conformities in the nature of the two ani|mals,
we may add the permanent marks of la|bour;
for, though the back of the lama be not
<PB N="444" REF="516">
deformed with bunches, like that of the camel,
he has natural callo&s;ities on his brea&s;t, becau&s;e
he has the &s;ame habit of repo&s;ing on that part of
the body. Notwith&s;tanding all the&s;e relations,
the &s;pecies of the lama is very different from that
of the camel. The lama exceeds not in magni|tude
one-fourth or one-third of that of the ca|mel.
The figure of his body, the quality and
colour of his hair, are al&s;o very different: His
temperament is phlegmatic, and he delights in
the mountains only. But the temperament of
the camel is adu&s;t, and lives &s;pontaneou&s;ly among
burning &s;ands. In fine, there are more &s;pecific
differences, perhaps, between the camel and la|ma,
than between the camel and giraffe. The&s;e
three animals po&s;&s;e&s;s &s;everal common characters,
by which they might be united into one genus.
But, at the &s;ame time, they differ &s;o much in o|ther
characters that they cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed to
have &s;prung from one another: They are neigh|bours,
but not relations. The giraffe is almo&s;t
double the height of the camel, and the camel
is double that of the lama. The two fir&s;t belong
to the Old Continent, and form di&s;tinct &s;pecies:
Of cour&s;e, the &s;pecies of the lama, which is pe|culiar
to the New World, is remote from both.</P>
<P>The &s;ame remark applies not to the pecari:
Though of a different &s;pecies from the hog, he
belongs to the &s;ame genus. In figure, and al|mo&s;t
every external relation, he re&s;embles the
hog; and only differs from that animal in &s;ome
<PB N="445" REF="517">
minute characters, &s;uch as the aperture on his
back, the figure of the &s;tomach and inte&s;tines,
&amp;c. We might therefore be led to think, that
the pecari had &s;prung from the &s;ame &s;tem with
the hog, and that he had formerly pa&s;&s;ed from
the Old to the New World, where, by the in|fluence
of the &s;oil, he had degenerated &s;o greatly
as now to form a di&s;tinct &s;pecies.</P>
<P>With regard to the pacos, though it &s;eems to
have &s;ome relations to the &s;heep by its wool and
habit of body, it differs &s;o much in every other
article, that they cannot be con&s;idered as allied
&s;pecies. The pacos is rather a &s;mall kind of la|ma,
and appears not, from any character, to have
ever pa&s;&s;ed from the one Continent to the other.
Hence, of the four detached &s;pecies peculiar to
the New World, three, namely, the tapir, the
cabiai, and the lama and pacos, appear to have
been at all times proper to this Continent. But
the pecari, which is the fourth, &s;eems to be only
a degenerated &s;pecies of hog, and to have for|merly
derived its origin from the Old Conti|nent.</P>
<P>From a &s;imilar examination and compari&s;on
of the ten genera, to which we have reduced
the other animals peculiar to South America, we
&s;hall find not only &s;ingular relations in their na|ture,
but marks of their antient origin and de|generation.
The &s;apajous and &s;agoins have &s;o
great a re&s;emblance to the monkeys, that they
have obtained the common name of ape. We
<PB N="446" REF="518">
have proved, however, that their &s;pecies, and
even their genera, are different. Be&s;ides, it
would be difficult to conceive how the monkeys
of the Old World could a&s;&s;ume, in America, a
different figure of face, a long, mu&s;cular, and
prehen&s;ile tail, a large partition between the no|&s;trils,
and other characters both &s;pecific and ge|neric,
by which we have di&s;tingui&s;hed and &s;epa|rated
them from the &s;apajous. But, as the apes,
the baboons, and the monkeys, are peculiar to
the Old World, the &s;apajous and &s;agoins &s;hould
be regarded as their repre&s;entatives in the New;
for the&s;e animals have nearly the &s;ame form,
both external and internal, and, in their man|ners
and di&s;po&s;itions, they po&s;&s;e&s;s many things
in common. In the &s;ame manner, there are no
makis in America, and yet they are repre&s;ented
by the opo&s;&s;ums, or four-handed animals with
&s;harp muzzles, which are very numerous in the
New Continent, but exi&s;t not in the Old. It mu&s;t
be remarked, however, that there is a much great|er
difference between the nature and form of the
makis and the&s;e four-handed American animals,
than between the monkeys and &s;apajous; and that
the interval between an opo&s;&s;um and a maki is
&s;o great, that we cannot think they ever pro|ceeded
from each other, without &s;uppo&s;ing that
degeneration is capable of producing effects e|qual
to tho&s;e of a new nature; for mo&s;t of the&s;e
American four-handed &s;pecies have a pouch un|der
the belly, ten cutting teeth in each jaw, and
<PB N="447" REF="519">
a prehen&s;ile tail; while the makis have no pouch
under their belly, a flaccid tail, and only four
cutting teeth in the upper, and &s;ix in the under
jaw. Hence, though the&s;e animals have their
hands and fingers con&s;tructed in the &s;ame man|ner,
and likewi&s;e re&s;emble each other in the
length of the muzzle, their &s;pecies, and even their
genera, are &s;o different, that it is impo&s;&s;ible to
imagine they ever proceeded from one another,
or that &s;uch great and general di&s;parities could
be produced by degeneration.</P>
<P>On the other hand, the American tigers, which
we have treated of under the appellation of ja|guars,
couguars, ocelots, and margais, though
different in &s;pecies from the panther, leopard,
ounce, and &s;erval of the Old Continent, unque|&s;tionably
belong to the &s;ame genus. All the&s;e
animals re&s;emble each other greatly, both exter|nally
and internally. They have al&s;o the &s;ame
natural di&s;po&s;itions, the &s;ame ferocity, the &s;ame
vehement thir&s;t for blood; and, what makes
them approach &s;till nearer in genus, tho&s;e of the
&s;ame Continent differ more from each other, than
from tho&s;e of the other Continent. For ex|ample,
the African panther differs le&s;s from the
Bra&s;ilian jaguar, than the latter differs from the
couguar, though they belong to the &s;ame coun|try.
In the &s;ame manner, the A&s;iatic &s;erval and
the margai of Guiana differ le&s;s from one ano|ther
than from the &s;pecies peculiar to their own
Continents. We may, therefore, conclude that
<PB N="448" REF="520">
the&s;e animals have had a common origin, and
that they have formerly pa&s;&s;ed from the one
Continent to the other. Their actual differen|ces
have proceeded &s;olely from the long conti|nued
influence of their new &s;ituation.</P>
<P>The mouffettes, or &s;tinking wea&s;els of Ameri|ca,
and the European polecat, &s;eem to belong
to the &s;ame genus. In general, when a genus is
common to both Continents, the &s;pecies of which
it is compo&s;ed are more numerous in the Old
than in the New. In this in&s;tance, however,
the contrary takes place: In America, there are
four or five &s;pecies of polecats, while we have
but one, who&s;e nature &s;eems to be inferior to
that of all the others; &s;o that the New World,
in its turn, appears to have repre&s;entatives in the
Old; and, if we judged only from the fact, we would
be led to think, that the&s;e animals had taken a
contrary route, and pa&s;&s;ed from America into
Europe. The &s;ame remark is applicable to &s;ome
other &s;pecies. The roebucks and the fallow-deer,
as well as the mouffettes, are more nume|rous
and likewi&s;e &s;tronger in the New than in
the Old Continent. We might, therefore, ima|gine
that they are original natives of America.
But, as we know that all animals were created
in the Old Continent, we mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily ad|mit
their migration from the Old to the New
World, and at the &s;ame time &s;uppo&s;e, that, in|&s;tead
of degenerating, like all the other Ameri|can
<PB N="449" REF="521">
&s;pecies, they have improved by the influen|ces
of the &s;oil and climate.</P>
<P>The ant-eaters, which are &s;ingular creatures,
and of which there are three or four &s;pecies in
the New World, appear al&s;o to have their repre|&s;entatives
in the Old. The &s;caly lizards re&s;emble
the ant-eaters in the peculiar character of having
no teeth, and of being obliged to &s;tretch out their
tongue and feed upon ants. But, if we a&s;&s;ign
them a common origin, it is &s;trange that, in&s;tead
of &s;cales, which they have in A&s;ia, they are co|vered
with hair in America.</P>
<P>With regard to the agoutis, pacos, and other
animals which con&s;titute the &s;eventh genus pe|culiar
to the New Continent, they can only be
compared with the hare and rabbit, from which,
however, they all differ in &s;pecies. It is diffi|cult
to a&s;&s;ign them a common origin; becau&s;e
the hare is diffu&s;ed over almo&s;t every climate of
the Old Continent, without undergoing any o|ther
change than in the colour of his hair. It is
by no means probable, therefore, that the cli|mate
of America &s;hould have &s;o far changed the
nature of our hares, as to make them tapetis and
apereas, which have no tail; or agoutis with a
&s;harp muzzle, and &s;hort round ears; or pacos
with a large head, &s;hort ears, and coar&s;e hair
with white bands.</P>
<P>In fine, the coatis, the armadillos, and the
&s;loths, differ &s;o much not only in &s;pecies, but in
genus, from all the animals in the Old World,
<PB N="450" REF="522">
that they can be compared to none of them, and
that it is impo&s;&s;ible to refer them to any com|mon
origin, or to a&s;cribe to the effects of dege|neration
the prodigious differences in their na|ture
from that of any other animal.</P>
<P>Thus, of ten genera and four detached &s;pecies,
to which we have endeavoured to reduce all the
animals peculiar to the New World, there are
only two, namely, the genus of jaguars, ocelots,
&amp;c. and the &s;pecies of the pecari, with their va|rieties,
which can, with any degree of probabili|ty,
be referred to the animals of the Old World.
The jaguars and ocelots may be regarded as &s;pe|cies
of the leopard or panther, and the pecari as
a &s;pecies of hog. There are al&s;o five genera and
one detached &s;pecies, namely, the &s;pecies of the
lama, the genera of &s;apajous, &s;agoins, mouffettes,
agoutis, and ant-eaters, which may be compa|red,
though in an equivocal and very di&s;tant
manner, with the camel, the monkeys, the pole|cat,
the hare, and the &s;caly lizards: And, in fine,
there remain four genera and two detached &s;pe|cies,
namely, the opo&s;&s;ums, the coatis, the arma|dillos,
the &s;loths, the tapir, and cabiai, which can
neither be referred nor compared to any genera
or &s;pecies in the Old Continent. This &s;eems to
be a &s;ufficient proof, that the origin of the&s;e ani|mals
peculiar to the New World cannot be at|tributed
to degeneration alone: However power|ful
we may &s;uppo&s;e the effects of degeneration,
we can never &s;uppo&s;e, with any appearance of
<PB N="451" REF="523">
rea&s;on, that the&s;e animals were originally the
&s;ame with tho&s;e of the Old Continent. It is
more probable, that the two Continents were for|merly
united, and that the &s;pecies which inha|bited
the New World, becau&s;e the &s;oil and cli|mate
were mo&s;t agreeable to their nature, were
&s;eparated from the others by the irruption of the
waters, when they divided Africa from America.
This is a natural cau&s;e; and &s;imilar cau&s;es might
be conceived which would produce the &s;ame ef|fect.
For example, if the &s;ea &s;hould make an
irruption into A&s;ia from ea&s;t to we&s;t, and &s;epa|rate
the &s;outhern regions of Africa and A&s;ia from
the re&s;t of the Continent, all the animals peculiar
to the&s;e countries, as the elephant, the rhinoce|ros,
the giraffe, the zebra, the orang-outang, &amp;c.
would be in the &s;ame &s;ituation with tho&s;e of
South America. They would be entirely &s;epa|rated
from tho&s;e of the temperate regions, and
could not be referred to an origin common to
any of the &s;pecies or genera which inhabit the&s;e
countries, &s;olely becau&s;e &s;ome imperfect re&s;em|blances
might be di&s;covered between them.</P>
<P>Hence, to di&s;cover the origin of the&s;e animals,
we mu&s;t have recour&s;e to the period when the
two Continents were united, and trace the fir&s;t
changes which have happened on the &s;urface of
the earth. We mu&s;t, at the &s;ame time, con&s;ider the
two hundred &s;pecies of quadrupeds as con&s;tituting
thirty-eight families: And, though this is by no
means the pre&s;ent &s;tate of nature, but, on the
<PB N="452" REF="524">
contrary, a &s;tate of much greater antiquity, which
we can reach only by inductions and relations
almo&s;t equally fugitive as time, that &s;eems to have
effaced their traces; we &s;hall, however, endea|vour
to a&s;cend, by facts and monuments &s;till ex|i&s;ting,
to tho&s;e fir&s;t ages of Nature, and to exhi|bit
tho&s;e epochas which &s;hall appear to be mo&s;t
clearly indicated.</P>
