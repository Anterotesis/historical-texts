<HEAD TYPE="sub">On the IMPORTANCE of ORDER in CONDUCT.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<BIBL>1 CORINTH. xiv. 40.</BIBL>
<Q>Let all things be done&mdash;in order.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>_RELIGION,<NOTE PLACE="marg">SERM. I.</NOTE> like every regular and
well-connected &s;y&s;tem, is compo&s;|ed
of a variety of parts; each of
which po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es its &s;eparate importance, and
contributes to the perfection of the whole.
Some graces are e&s;&s;entail to it; &s;uch as faith
and repentance, the love of God, and the
love of our neighbour; which, for that rea|&s;on,
<PB N="2" REF="9">
mu&s;t be often inculcated on men.
There are other di&s;po&s;itions and habits
which though they hold not &s;o high a rank,
yet are nece&s;&s;ary to the introduction and
&s;upport of the former; and therefore, in
religious exhortations the&s;e al&s;o ju&s;tly claim
a place. Of this nature is that regard to
order, method and regularity, which the
apo&s;tle enjoins us in the text to carry
though the whole of life. Whether you
con&s;ider it as, in it&s;elf, a moral duty, or
not, yet I hope &s;oon to convince you that
it is e&s;&s;ential to the proper di&s;charge of $$|mo&s;t
all duties, and merits upon that ac|count
a greater degree of attention than is
commonly paid to it in a religious view.</P>
<P>If you look abroad into the world, you
may be &s;atisfied, at the fir&s;t glance, that a
vicious and libertine life is always a life of
confu&s;ion. Thence it is natural to infer
that order is friendly to religion. As the
neglect of it co-operates with vice, &s;o the
pre&s;ervation of it mu&s;t a&s;&s;i&s;t virtue. By the
appointment of providence, it is indi&s;pen|&s;ably
requi&s;ite to worldly pro&s;perity. Thence
<PB N="3" REF="10">
ari&s;es a pre&s;umption that it is connected
al&s;o with &s;piritual improvement. When
you behold a man's affairs, through ne|gligence
and mi&s;conduct, involved in di&s;|order,
you naturally conclude that his ruin
approaches. You may at the &s;ame time
ju&s;tly &s;u&s;pect, that the cau&s;es which affect
his temporal welfare, operate al&s;o to the
prejudice of his moral intere&s;ts. The apo|&s;tle
teaches us in this chapter, that <HI>God is
not the author of confu&s;ion</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Ver. 33.</NOTE> He is a lover
of order; and all his works are full of order.
But <HI>where confu&s;ion is, there is,</HI> its clo&s;e
attendant, <HI>every evil work</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">James iii. 16.</NOTE> In the &s;e|quel
of this di&s;cour&s;e I &s;hall point out &s;ome
of tho&s;e parts of conduct wherein it is mo&s;t
material to virtue that order take place; and
then &s;hall conclude with &s;howing the high
advantages which attend it. Allow me to
recommend to you, order in the conduct of
your affairs; order in the di&s;tribution of
your time; order in the management of
your fortune; order in the regulation of
<PB N="4" REF="11">
your amu&s;ements; order in the arrange|ment
of your &s;ociety. Thus <HI>let all things
be done in order.</HI></P>
<P>I. MAINTAIN order in the conduct of
your wordly affairs. Every man, in every
&s;tation of life, has &s;ome concerns, private,
dome&s;tic, or public, which require &s;ucce&s;|&s;ive
attention he is placed in &s;ome &s;phere
of active duty. Let the employments
which belong to that &s;phere be &s;o arranged,
that each may keep its place, without ju&s;t|$ing
another; and that what regards the
world may not interfere with what is due
to God. In proportion to the multiplicity
of affairs, the ob&s;ervance of order becomes
more indi&s;pen&s;able. But &s;carcely is there
any train of life &s;o &s;imple and uniform but
what will &s;uffer through the neglect of it.
I &s;peak not now of &s;uffering in point of
worldly intere&s;t. I call upon you to attend
to higher intere&s;ts; to remember that the
orderly conduct of your temporal affairs
forms a great part of your duty as Chri&s;t|ians.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="12">
Many, indeed, can hardly be per&s;uaded
of this truth. A &s;trong propen&s;ity has, in
every age, appeared among men to &s;eque|&s;trate
religion from the commerce of the
world. Sea&s;ons of retreat and devotion
they are willing to appropriate to God.
But the world they con&s;ider as their own
province. They carry on a &s;ort of &s;epa|rate
intere&s;t there. Nay, by the re&s;pect
which, on particular occa&s;ions, they pay to
religion, they too often imagine that they
have acquired the liberty of acting in
worldly matters according to what plan
they chu&s;e. How entirely do &s;uch per&s;ons
mi&s;take the de&s;ign of Chri&s;tianity!&mdash;In this
world you were placed by Providence as on
a great field of trial. By the nece&s;&s;ities of
your nature you are called forth to differ|ent
employments. By many ties you are
connected with human &s;ociety. From &s;u|periours
and inferiours, from neighbours
and equals, from friends and enemies, de|mands
ari&s;e, and obligations circulate
through all the ranks of life. This active
&s;eene was contrived by the wi&s;dom of hea|ven,
<PB N="6" REF="13">
on purpo&s;e that it might bring into
exerci&s;e all the virtues of the chri&s;tian cha|racter;
your ju&s;tice, candour and veracity
in dealing with one another; your &s;idelity
to every tru&s;t, and your con&s;cientious di&s;|charge
of every office, which is committed
to you; your affection for your friends;
your forgivene&s;s of enemies; your charity
to the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed; your attention to the in|tere&s;ts
of your family. It is by fulfilling all
the&s;e obligations, in proper &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, that
you &s;how <HI>your conver&s;ation to be &s;uch as be|cometh
the go&s;pel of Chri&s;t.</HI> It is thus you
make <HI>your light &s;o to &s;hine before men, that
they may &s;ee your good works, and glorify your
Father which is in heaven.</HI> It is thus you
are rendered <HI>meet for the inheritance of the
&s;aints in light.</HI>&mdash;But how can tho&s;e various
duties be di&s;charged by per&s;ons who are
ever in that hurry and perplexity which
di&s;order creates? You wi&s;h, perhaps, to
perform what your character and &s;tation
require. But from the confu&s;ion in which
you have allowed your&s;elves to be involved,
you find it to have become impo&s;&s;ible.
<PB N="7" REF="14">
What was neglected to be done in its pro|per
place, thru&s;ts it&s;elf forward at an incon|venient
&s;ea&s;on. A multitude of affairs
crowd upon you together. Different obli|gations
di&s;tract you; and this di&s;traction
in &s;ometimes the cau&s;e, &s;ometimes the pre|tence,
of equally neglecting them all, or,
at lea&s;t, of &s;acrificing the greater to the
le&s;&s;er.</P>
<P>Hence ari&s;e &s;o many incon&s;i&s;tent charac|ters,
and &s;uch frequent in&s;tances of partial
and divided goodne&s;s, as we find in the
world; appearances of genero&s;ity without
ju&s;tice, honour without truth, probity to
men without reverence of God. He who
conducts his affairs with method and regu|larity,
meets every duty in its proper place,
and a&s;&s;igns it its due rank. But where there
is no order in conduct, there can be no uni|formity
in character. The natural connex|ion
and arrangement of duties is lo&s;t. If
virtue appear at all, it will be only in fits
and &s;tarts. The authority of con&s;cience
may occa&s;ionally operate, when our &s;itua|tion
affords it room for exertion. But in
<PB N="8" REF="15">
other circum&s;tances of equal importance,
every moral &s;entiment will be overpowered
by the tumultuous bu&s;tle of worldly affairs.
Fretfulne&s;s of temper too, will generally
characterize tho&s;e who are negligent of or|der.
The hurry in which they live, and
the embarra&s;&s;ments with which they are
&s;urrounded, keep their &s;pirits in perpetual
ferment. Conflicting with difficulties which
they are unable to overcome, con&s;cious of
their own mi&s;conduct, but a&s;hamed to con|fe&s;s
it, they are engaged in many a &s;ecret
&s;truggle; and the unea&s;ine&s;s which they
&s;uffer within, recoils in bad humour on all
who are around them. Hence the wretch|ed
re&s;ources to which, at la&s;t, they are obliged
to fly, in order to quiet their cares. In de|&s;pair
of being able to unravel what they
have &s;uffered to become &s;o perplexed, they
&s;ometimes &s;ink into &s;upine indolence, &s;ome|times
throw them&s;elves into the arms of
intemperance and loo&s;e plea&s;ure; by either
of which they aggravate their guilt, and ac|celerate
their ruin. To the end that order
may be maintained in your affairs, it is ne|ce&s;&s;ary,</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="16">
II. THAT you attend to order in the di&s;|tribution
of your time. Time you ought to
con&s;ider as a &s;acred tru&s;t committed to you
by God; of which you are now the depo|&s;itaries,
and are to render account at the la&s;t.
That portion of it which he has al|lotted
you is intended partly for the con|cerns
of this world, partly for tho&s;e of the
next. Let each of the&s;e occupy in the di&s;|tribution
of your time that &s;pace which
properly belongs to it. Let not the hours
of ho&s;pitality and plea&s;ure interfere with
the di&s;charge of your nece&s;&s;ary affairs; and
let not what you call nece&s;&s;ary affairs en|croach
upon the time which is due to de|votion.
<HI>To every thing there is a &s;ea&s;on, and
a time for every purpo&s;e under the heaven.</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Eccle&s;. iii. 1.</NOTE>
If you delay till to-morrow what ought to
be done to-day, you overcharge the mor|row
with a burden which belongs not to it.
You load the wheels of time, and prevent
it from carrying you along &s;moothly. He
who every morning plans the tran&s;actions
<PB N="10" REF="17">
of the day, and follows out that plan, carries
on a thread which will guide him through
the labyrinth of the mo&s;t bu&s;y life. The
orderly arrangement of his time is like a
ray of light which darts it&s;elf through all
his affairs. But where no plan is laid,
where the di&s;po&s;al of time is &s;urrendered
merely to the chance of incidents, all things
lie huddled together in one chaos, which
admits neither of di&s;tribution nor review.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t requi&s;ite for introducing order
into the management of time, is to be im|pre&s;&s;ed
with a ju&s;t &s;en&s;e of its value. Con|&s;ider
well how much depends upon it, and
how fa&s;t it flies away. The bulk of men
are in nothing more capricious and incon|&s;i&s;tent
than in their appretiation of time.
When they think of it as the mea&s;ure of
their continuance on earth, they highly
prize it, and with the greate&s;t anxiety &s;eek
to lengthen it out. But when they view it
in &s;eparate parcels, they appear to hold it
in contempt, and &s;quander it with incon|&s;iderate
profu&s;ion. While they complain
that life is &s;hort, they are often wi&s;hing its
<PB N="11" REF="18">
different periods at an end. Covetous of
every other po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, of time only they are
prodigal. They allow every idle man to be
ma&s;ter of this property, and make every
frivolous occupation welcome that can help
them to con&s;ume it. Among tho&s;e who are
&s;o carele&s;s of time, it is not to be expected
that order &s;hould be ob&s;erved in its di&s;tri|bution.
But by this fatal neglect, how
many materials of &s;evere and la&s;ting regret
are they laying up in &s;tore for them&s;elves!
The time which they &s;uffer to pa&s;s away in
the mid&s;t of confu&s;ion, bitter repentance
&s;eeks afterwards in vain to recal. What
was omitted to be done at its proper mo|ment,
ari&s;es to be the torment of &s;ome fu|ture
&s;ea&s;on. Manhood is di&s;graced by the
con&s;equences of neglected youth. Old age,
oppre&s;&s;ed by cares that belonged to a former
period, labours under a burden not its own.
At the clo&s;e of life, the dying man be|holds
with angui&s;h that his days are fini&s;h|ing,
when his preparation for eternity is
hardly commenced. Such are the effects
of a di&s;orderly wa&s;te of time, through not
<PB N="12" REF="19">
attending to its value. Every thing in the
life of &s;uch per&s;ons is mi&s;placed. Nothing
is performed aright, from not being per|formed
in due &s;ea&s;on.</P>
<P>But he who is orderly in the di&s;tribution
of his time, takes the proper method of
e&s;caping tho&s;e manifold evils. He is ju&s;tly
&s;aid to <HI>redeem the time.</HI> By proper manage|ment,
he prolongs it. He lives much in
little &s;pace; more in a few years than
others do in many. He can live to God
and his own &s;oul, and at the &s;ame time at|tend
to all the lawful intere&s;ts of he pre&s;ent
world. He looks back on the pa&s;t, and
provides for the future. He catches and
arre&s;ts the hours as they fly. They are
marked down for u&s;eful purpo&s;es, and their
memory remains. Whereas tho&s;e hours fleet
by the man of confu&s;ion like a &s;hadow.
His days and years are either blanks of
which he has no remembrance, or they are
filled up with &s;uch a confu&s;ed and irregular
&s;ucce&s;&s;ion of unfini&s;hed tran&s;actions, that
though he remembers he has been bu&s;y,
yet he can give no account of the bu&s;ine&s;s
<PB N="13" REF="20">
which has employed him. Of him, more
than of any other, it may with ju&s;tice be
pronounced, that the <HI>walketh in a vain &s;hew;
he is di&s;quieted in vain.</HI></P>
<P>III. INTRODUCE order into the manage|ment
of your fortune. Whatever it be, let
the admini&s;tration of it proceed with me|thod
and oeconomy. From time to time
examine your &s;ituation; and proportion
your expence to your growing or dimini&s;h|ing
revenue. Provide what is nece&s;&s;ary,
before you indulge in what is &s;uperfluous.
Study to do ju&s;tice to all with whom you
deal, before you affect the prai&s;e of libera|lity.
In a word, fix &s;uch a plan of living
as you find that your circum&s;tances will
fairly admit, and adhere to it invariably
again&s;t every temptation to improper ex|ce&s;s.</P>
<P>No admonition re&s;pecting morals is more
nece&s;&s;ary than this to the age in which we
live; an age manife&s;tly di&s;tingui&s;hed by a
propen&s;ity to thoughtle&s;s profu&s;ion; wherein
all the different ranks of men are ob&s;erved
<PB N="14" REF="21">
to pre&s;s with forward vanity on tho&s;e who
are above them; to vie with their &s;upe|riours
in every mode of luxury and o&s;tenta|tion;
and to &s;eek no farther argument for
ju&s;tifying extravagance, than the fa&s;hion of
the times, and the &s;uppo&s;ed nece&s;&s;ity of
living like others around them. This turn
of mind begets contempt for &s;ober and or|derly
plans of life. It overthrows all re|gard
to dome&s;tic concerns and duties. It
pu&s;hes men on to hazardous and vi&s;ionary
&s;chemes of gain; and unfortunately unites
the two extremes, of gra&s;ping with rapaci|ou&s;ne&s;s,
and of &s;quandering with profu&s;ion.
In the mid&s;t of &s;uch di&s;order no pro&s;perity
can be of long continuance. While con|fu&s;ion
grows upon men's affairs, and pro|digality
at the &s;ame time wa&s;tes their &s;ub|&s;tance,
poverty makes its advances <HI>like an
armed man.</HI> They tremble at the view of
the approaching evil; but have lo&s;t the
force of mind to make provi&s;ion again&s;t it.
Accu&s;tomed to move in a round of &s;ociety
and plea&s;ures di&s;proporotioned to their con|dition,
they are unable to break through
<PB N="15" REF="22">
the enchantments of habit; and with their
eyes open &s;ink into the gulph which is be|fore
them. Poverty enforces dependance;
and dependance increa&s;es corruption. Ne|ce&s;&s;ity
fir&s;t betrays them into mean com|pliances;
next, impels them to open crimes;
and beginning with o&s;tentation and extra|vagance,
they end in infamy and guilt.
Such are the con&s;equences of neglecting
order in our worldly circum&s;tances. Such
is the circle in which the profu&s;e and the
di&s;&s;olute daily run.&mdash;To what cau&s;e, &s;o
much as to the want of order, can we attri|bute
tho&s;e &s;cenes of di&s;tre&s;s which &s;o fre|quently
excite our pity; families that once
were flouri&s;hing reduced to ruin; and the
melancholy widow and neglected orphan
thrown forth, friendle&s;s, upon the world?
What cau&s;e has been more fruitful in en|gendering
tho&s;e atrocious crimes which fill
&s;ociety with di&s;quiet and terrour; in train|ing
the game&s;ter to fraud, the robber to
violence, and even the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in to blood?</P>
<P>Be a&s;&s;ured, then, that order, frugality,
and oeconomy, are the nece&s;&s;ary &s;upports of
<PB N="16" REF="23">
every per&s;onal and private virtue. How
humble &s;oever the&s;e qualities may appear to
&s;ome, they are, nevertheless, the ba&s;is on
which liberty, independence, and true ho|nour,
mu&s;t ri&s;e. He who has the &s;teadine&s;s
to arrange his affairs with method and re|gularity,
and to conduct his train of life
agreeably to his circum&s;tances, can be ma&s;ter
of him&s;elf in every &s;ituation into which he
may be thrown. He is under no nece&s;&s;ity
to flatter or to lie; to &s;toop to what is
mean, or to commit what is criminal. But
he who wants that firmne&s;s of mind which
the ob&s;ervance of order requires, is held in
bondage to the world; he can neither act
his part with courage as a man, nor with
fidelity as a Chri&s;tian. From the moment
you have allowed your&s;elves to pa&s;s the line
of oeconomy, and to live beyond your for|tune,
you have entered on the path of
danger. Precipices &s;urround you on all
&s;ides. Every &s;tep which you take may
lead to mi&s;chiefs that, as yet, lie hidden;
and to crimes that will end in your ever|la&s;ting
perdition.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="24">
IV. OBSERVE order in your amu&s;ements;
that is, allow them no more than their pro|per
place; &s;tudy to keep them within due
bounds; mingle them in a temperate &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion
with &s;erious duties, and the higher
bu&s;ine&s;s of life. Human life cannot pro|ceed
to advantage without &s;ome mea&s;ure of
relaxation and entertainment. We require
relief from care. We are not formed for a
perpetual &s;tretch of &s;erious thought. By
too inten&s;e and continued application, our
feeble powers would &s;oon be worn out. At
the &s;ame time, from our propen&s;ity to ea&s;e
and plea&s;ure, amu&s;ement proves, among all
ranks of men, the mo&s;t dangerous foe to
order. For it tends ince&s;&s;antly to u&s;urp and
encroach, to widen its territories, to thru&s;t
it&s;elf into the place of more important con|cerns,
and thereby to di&s;turb and counter|act
the natural cour&s;e of things. One fri|volous
amu&s;ement indulged out of &s;ea&s;on,
will often carry perplexity and confu&s;ion
through a long &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of affairs.</P>
<P>Amu&s;ements, therefore, though they be
of an innocent kind, require &s;teady go|vernment,
<PB N="18" REF="25">
to keep them within a due and
limited province. But &s;uch as are of an
irregular and vicious nature, require not to
be governed, but to be bani&s;hed from every
orderly &s;ociety. As &s;oon as a man &s;eeks his
happine&s;s from the gaming-table, the mid|night-revel,
and the other haunts of licen|tiou&s;ne&s;s,
confu&s;ion &s;eizes upon him as its
own. There will no longer be order in his
family, nor order in his affairs, nor order
in his time. The mo&s;t important concerns
of life are abandoned. Even the order of
nature is by &s;uch per&s;ons inverted; night
is changed into day, and day into night.
Character, honour, and intere&s;t it&s;elf, are
trampled under foot. You may with cer|tainty
progno&s;ticate the ruin of the&s;e men
to be ju&s;t at hand. Di&s;order, ari&s;en to its
height, has nearly accomplished its work.
The &s;pots of death are upon them. Let
every one who would e&s;cape the pe&s;tilen|tial
contagion fly with ha&s;te from their
company.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="26">
V. PRESERVE order in the arrangement
of your &s;ociety; that is, entangle not your|&s;elves
in a perpetual and promi&s;cuous crowd;
&s;elect with prudence and propriety tho&s;e with
whom you chu&s;e to a&s;&s;ociate; let company
and retreat &s;ucceed each other at mea&s;ured
intervals. There can be no order in his life
who allots not a due &s;hare of his time to
retirement and reflection. He can neither
prudently arrange his temporal affairs, nor
properly attend to his &s;piritual intere&s;ts.
He lives not to him&s;elf, but to the world.
By continual di&s;&s;ipation, he is rendered
giddy and thoughtle&s;s. He contracts un|avoidably
from the world that &s;pirit of di&s;|order
and confu&s;ion which is &s;o prevalent
in it.</P>
<P>It is not a &s;ufficient pre&s;ervative again&s;t
this evil, that the circles of &s;ociety in which
you are engaged are not of a libertine and
vicious kind. If they withdraw you from
that attention to your&s;elves, and your do|me&s;tic
concerns, which becomes a good man,
they are &s;ubver&s;ive of order, and incon|&s;i&s;tent
with your duty. What is innocent
<PB N="20" REF="27">
in it&s;elf, degenerates into crime from being
carried to exce&s;s; and idle, trifling &s;ociety
is nearly a-kin to &s;uch as is corrupting. One
of the fir&s;t principles of order is, to learn to
be happy at home. It is in dome&s;tic re|treat
that every wi&s;e and virtuous man finds
his chief &s;atisfaction. It is there he forms
the plans which regulate his public conduct.
He who knows not how to enjoy him&s;elf
when alone, can never be long happy
abroad. To his vacant mind, company
may afford a temporary relief; but when
forced to return to him&s;elf, he will be &s;o
much more oppre&s;&s;ed and languid. Where|as,
by a due mixture of public and private
life, we keep free of the &s;nares of both, and
enjoy each to greater advantage.</P>
<P>WHEN we review tho&s;e different parts of
behaviour to which I have &s;hewn that order
is e&s;&s;ential, it mu&s;t naturally occur to you,
that they are all mutually connected, and
hang upon each other. Throughout your
affairs, your time, your expence, your
amu&s;ements, your &s;ociety, the principle of
<PB N="21" REF="28">
order mu&s;t be equally carried, if you ex|pect
to reap any of its happy fruits. For
if into any one of tho&s;e great departments
of life you &s;uffer di&s;order to enter, it will
&s;pread through all the re&s;t. In vain, for
in&s;tance, you purpo&s;e to be orderly in the
conduct of your affairs, if you be irregular
in the di&s;tribution of your time. In vain
you attempt to regulate your expence, if
into your amu&s;ements, or your &s;ociety, di&s;|order
has crept. You have admitted a
principle of confu&s;ion which will defeat all
your plans; and perplex and entangle what
you &s;ought to arrange. Uniformity is above
all things nece&s;&s;ary to order. If you de&s;ire
that any thing &s;hould proceed according to
method and rule, let <HI>all things,</HI> as the text
exhorts, <HI>be done in order.</HI></P>
<P>I mu&s;t al&s;o admoni&s;h you, that in &s;mall,
as well as in great affairs, a due regard to
order is requi&s;ite. I mean not that you
ought to look on tho&s;e minute attentions
which are apt to occupy frivolous minds,
as connected either with virtue or wi&s;dom.
But I exhort you to remember, that di&s;order,
<PB N="22" REF="29">
like other immoralities, frequently takes ri&s;e
from incon&s;iderable beginnings. They who,
in the le&s;&s;er tran&s;actions of life, are totally
negligent of rule, will be in hazard of ex|tending
that negligence by degrees to &s;uch
affairs and duties as will render them cri|minal.
Remi&s;&s;ne&s;s grows on all who &s;tudy
not to guard again&s;t it; and it is only by
frequent exerci&s;e that the habits of order
and punctuality can be thoroughly con|firmed.</P>
<P>FROM what has been &s;aid, the great im|portance
of this principle to moral and reli|gious
conduct mu&s;t already be evident.
Let us, however, conclude with taking a
&s;ummary view of the advantages which at|tend
it.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, the ob&s;ervance of order &s;erves to
correct that negligence which makes you
omit &s;ome duties, and that hurry and pre|cipitancy
which makes you perform others
imperfectly. Your attention is thereby di|rected
to its proper objects. You follow the
&s;treight path which Providence has pointed
<PB N="23" REF="30">
out to man; in the cour&s;e of which all the
different bu&s;ine&s;s of life pre&s;ents it&s;elf regu|larly
to him on every &s;ide. God and man,
time and eternity, po&s;&s;e&s;s their proper &s;ta|tions,
ari&s;e in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to his view, and
attract his care. Whereas he who runs on
in a di&s;orderly cour&s;e, &s;peedily involves
him&s;elf in a labyrinth, where he is &s;ur|rounded
with intricacy and darkne&s;s. The
crooked paths into which he &s;trikes, turn
him a&s;ide from the proper line of human
pur&s;uit; hide from his &s;ight the objects
which he ought chiefly to regard, and
bring others under his view, which &s;erve
no purpo&s;e but to di&s;tract and mi&s;lead him.</P>
<P>Next, by attending to order, you avoid
idlene&s;s, that mo&s;t fruitful &s;ource of crimes
and evils. Acting upon a plan, meeting
every thing in its own place, you con&s;tantly
find innocent and u&s;eful employment for
time. You are never at a lo&s;s how to di&s;|po&s;e
of your hours, or to fill up life agree|ably.
In the cour&s;e of human action, there
are two extremes equally dangerous to vir|tue;
the multiplicity of affairs, and the
<PB N="24" REF="31">
total want of them. The man of order
&s;tands in the middle between the&s;e two ex|tremes,
and &s;uffers from neither. He is
occupied, but not oppre&s;&s;ed. Whereas the
di&s;orderly, overloading one part of time,
and leaving another vacant, are at one pe|riod
overwhelmed with bu&s;ine&s;s, and at
another, either idle through want of em|ployment,
or indolent through perplexity.
Tho&s;e &s;ea&s;ons of indolence and idlene&s;s,
which recur &s;o often in their life, are their
mo&s;t dangerous moments. The mind, un|happy
in its &s;ituation, and clinging to every
object which can occupy or amu&s;e it, is
then apte&s;t to throw it&s;elf into the arms of
every vice and every folly.</P>
<P>Farther, by the pre&s;ervation of order,
you check incon&s;tancy and levity. Fickle
by nature is the human heart. It is fond
of change; and perpetually tends to &s;tart
a&s;ide from the &s;treight line of conduct.
Hence ari&s;es the propriety of bringing our|&s;elves
under &s;ubjection to method and rule;
which, though at fir&s;t it may prove con|&s;training,
yet by degrees, and from the ex|perience
<PB N="25" REF="32">
of its happy effects, becomes na|tural
and agreeable. It rectifies tho&s;e irre|gularities
of temper and manners to which
we give the name of caprice; and which
are di&s;tingui&s;hing characteri&s;tics of a di&s;or|derly
mind. It is the parent of &s;teadine&s;s
of conduct. It forms con&s;i&s;tency of cha|racter.
It is the ground of all the confi|dence
we repo&s;e in one another. For, the
di&s;orderly we know not where to find. In
him only can we place any tru&s;t who is
uniform and regular; who lives by prin|ciple,
not by humour; who acts upon a
plan, and not by de&s;ultory motions.</P>
<P>The advantages of order hitherto men|tioned
belong to rectitude of conduct.
Con&s;ider al&s;o how important it is to your
&s;elf-enjoyment and felicity. Order is the
&s;ource of peace; and peace is the highe&s;t
of all temporal ble&s;&s;ings. Order is indeed
the only region in which tranquillity dwells.
The very mention of confu&s;ion imports
di&s;turbance and vexation. Is it po&s;&s;ible
for that man to be happy who cannot look
into the &s;tate of his affairs, or the tenor of
<PB N="26" REF="33">
his conduct, without di&s;cerning all to be
embroiled; who is either in the mid&s;t of
remor&s;e for what he has neglected to do,
or in the mid&s;t of hurry to overtake what
he finds, too late, was nece&s;&s;ary to have
been done? Such as live according to or|der
may be compared to the cele&s;tial bodies
which move in regular cour&s;es, and by &s;tat|ed
laws; who&s;e influence is beneficent;
who&s;e operations are quiet and tranquil.
The di&s;orderly re&s;emble tho&s;e tumultuous
elements on earth which, by &s;udden and
violent irruptions, di&s;turb the cour&s;e of
nature. By mi&s;management of affairs, by
exce&s;s in expence, by irregularity in the
indulgence of company and amu&s;ement,
they are perpetually creating mole&s;tation
both to them&s;elves and others. They de|part
from their road to &s;eek plea&s;ure; and
in&s;tead of it, they every where rai&s;e up
&s;orrows. Being always found out of their
proper place, they of cour&s;e interfere and
jar with others. The di&s;orders which they
rai&s;e never fail to &s;pread beyond their own
line, and to involve many in confu&s;ion
<PB N="27" REF="34">
and di&s;tre&s;s; whence they nece&s;&s;arily be|come
the authors of tumult and conten|tion,
of di&s;cord and enmity. Whereas or|der
is the foundation of union. It allows
every man to carry on his own affairs
without di&s;turbing his neighbour. It is the
golden chain which holds together the &s;o|cieties
of men in friend&s;hip and peace.</P>
<P>In fine, the man of order is connected
with all the higher powers and principles
in the univer&s;e. He is the follower of God.
He walks with him, and acts upon his plan.
His character is formed on the &s;pirit which
religion breathes. For religion in general,
and the religion of Chri&s;t in particular, may
be called the great di&s;cipline of order. To
<HI>walk &s;infully, and to walk di&s;orderly,</HI> are
&s;ynonymous terms in Scripture. From
<HI>&s;uch as walk di&s;orderly</HI> we are commanded,
<HI>in the name of the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> to
<HI>withdraw our&s;elves.</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">2 The&s;&s;. iii. 6.</NOTE> The kingdom of
Satan is the reign of di&s;order and darkne&s;s.
To re&s;tore order among the works of God,
<PB N="28" REF="35">
was the end for which the Son of God de|&s;cended
to the earth. He requires order to
be ob&s;erved in his church. His undertak|ing
is to be con&s;ummated in that perfect
order which he &s;hall introduce at the la&s;t
day. In <HI>the new earth and the new heavens,</HI>
undi&s;turbed order &s;hall for ever prevail
among the <HI>&s;pirits of the ju&s;t made perfect;</HI>
and whatever farther preparation may be
requi&s;ite for our being admitted to join their
&s;ociety, it is certain that we &s;hall never
&s;hare in it, unle&s;s we make it now our
&s;tudy to <HI>do all things decently and in order.</HI></P>

given by this in&s;pired writer,<NOTE PLACE="marg">SERM. II.</NOTE> there
is none which de&s;erves greater regard than
that contained in the text. Its importance,
however, is too &s;eldom perceived by the
generality of men. They are apt to con|&s;ider
the regulation of external conduct as
the chief object of religion. If they can

us <HI>to keep the heart;</HI> that is, to attend
not only to our actions, but to our thoughts

purpo&s;e to con&s;ider, &s;eparately, the govern|ment
of the thoughts, of the pa&s;&s;ions, and
of the temper. But before entering on any
of the&s;e, let us begin with enquiring in
what &s;en&s;e <HI>the i&s;&s;ues of life</HI> are &s;aid to be <HI>out
of the heart;</HI> that we may di&s;cern the force
of the argument which the text &s;ugge&s;ts, to
recommend this great duty of <HI>keeping the
heart.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The i&s;&s;ues of life</HI> are ju&s;tly &s;aid to be out
of the heart, becau&s;e the &s;tate of the heart
is what determines our moral character,
and what forms our chief happine&s;s or mi&s;ery.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="38">
FIRST, it is the &s;tate of the heart which
determines our moral character. The te|nor
of our actions will always corre&s;pond
to the di&s;po&s;itions that prevail within.
To di&s;&s;emble or to &s;uppre&s;s them, is a fruit|le&s;s
attempt. In &s;pite of our efforts, they
will perpetually break forth in our beha|viour.
On whatever &s;ide the weight of
inclination hangs, it will draw the practice
after it. In vain therefore you &s;tudy to
pre&s;erve your hands clean, unle&s;s you re|&s;olve
at the &s;ame time to keep your heart
pure. <HI>Make the tree good,</HI> as our Saviour
directs, <HI>and then its fruits will be good al&s;o.</HI>
For <HI>out of the heart proceed</HI> not only <HI>evil
thoughts,</HI> but <HI>murders, adulteries, fornica|tions,
theft, fal&s;e witne&s;s, bla&s;phemies.</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Math. xv. 18.</NOTE> If
that fountain be once poi&s;oned, you can
never expect that &s;alubrious &s;treams will
flow from it. Throughout the whole of
their cour&s;e, they will carry the taint of
the parent &s;pring.</P>
<P>But it is not merely from its influence on
external action that the importance of the
<PB N="32" REF="39">
heart to our moral character ari&s;es. Inde|pendent
of all action, it is, in truth, the
&s;tate of the heart it&s;elf which forms our
character in the &s;ight of God. With our
fellow-creatures, actions mu&s;t ever hold the
chief rank; becau&s;e, by the&s;e only we can
judge of one another; by the&s;e we affect
each other's welfare; and therefore to the&s;e
alone the regulation of human law extends.
But in the eye of that Supreme Being, to
whom our whole internal frame is unco|vered,
di&s;po&s;itions hold the place of actions;
and it is not &s;o much what we perform, as
the motive which moves us to perform|ance,
that con&s;titutes us good or evil in
his &s;ight. Even among men, the mora|lity
of actions is e&s;timated by the principle
from which they are judged to proceed;
and &s;uch as the principle is, &s;uch is the
man accounted to be. One, for in&s;tance,
may &s;pend much of his fortune in chari|table
actions; and yet, if he is believed to be
influenced by mere o&s;tentation, he is deem|ed
not charitable, but vain. He may la|bour
unweariedly to &s;erve the public; but
<PB N="33" REF="40">
if he is prompted by the de&s;ire of ri&s;ing
into power, he is held not public &s;pirited,
but ambitious: And if he be&s;tows a bene|fit
purely that he may receive a greater in
return, no man would reckon him gene|rous,
but &s;elfi&s;h and intere&s;ted. If rea&s;on
thus clearly teaches us to e&s;timate the value
of actions by the di&s;po&s;itions which give
them birth, it is an obvious conclu&s;ion, that
according to tho&s;e di&s;po&s;itions we are all
ranked and cla&s;&s;ed by him who &s;eeth into
every heart. The rectification of our prin|ciples
of action is the primary object of
religious di&s;cipline: and in proportion as
this is more or le&s;s advanced, we are more
or le&s;s religious. Accordingly, the rege|neration
of the heart is every where repre|&s;ented
in the Go&s;pel as the mo&s;t e&s;&s;entail
requi&s;ite in the character of a Chri&s;tian.</P>
<P>SECONDLY, the &s;tate of the heart not
only determines our moral character, but
forms our principal happine&s;s or mi&s;ery.
External &s;ituations of fortune are no far|ther
of con&s;equence than as they operate on
<PB N="34" REF="41">
the heart; and their operation there is far
from corre&s;ponding to the degree of worldly
pro&s;perity or adver&s;ity. If, from any in|ternal
cau&s;e a man's peace of mind be
di&s;turbed, in vain you load him with all
the honours or riches which the world can
be&s;tow. They remain without, like things
at a di&s;tance from him. They reach not
the &s;ource of enjoyment. Di&s;compo&s;ed
thoughts, agitated pa&s;&s;ions, and a ruffled
temper, poi&s;on every ingredient of plea|&s;ure
which the world holds out; and over|ca&s;t
every object which pre&s;ents it&s;elf, with
a melancholy gloom. In order to acquire
a capacity for happine&s;s, it mu&s;t be our fir&s;t
&s;tudy to rectify &s;uch inward di&s;orders.
Whatever di&s;cipline tends to accompli&s;h
this purpo&s;e, is of greater importance to
man than the acqui&s;ition of the advantages
of fortune. The&s;e are precarious and
doubtful in their effect; internal tranquil|lity
is a certain good. The&s;e are only
means; but that is the end. The&s;e are no
more than in&s;truments of &s;atisfaction: that,
is &s;atisfaction it&s;elf.</P>

of any &s;ort. He lies open to every
in&s;urrection of ill-humour, and every inva|&s;ion
of di&s;tre&s;s. Whereas he who is em|ployed
in regulating his mind is making
provision again&s;t all the accidents of life.
He is erecting a fortre&s;s into which, in the
day of danger, he can retreat with &s;afety.
And hence, amid&s;t tho&s;e endeavours to &s;e|cure
happine&s;s which ince&s;&s;antly employ
the life of man, the careful regulation, or
the improvident neglect of the inward
frame, forms the chief di&s;tinction between
wi&s;dom and folly.</P>
<P>THUS it appears with how much pro|priety
the <HI>i&s;&s;ues of life</HI> are &s;aid to be <HI>out of
the heart.</HI> Here ri&s;e tho&s;e great &s;prings of
human conduct whence the main currents
<PB N="36" REF="43">
flow of our virtue, or our vice; of our hap|pine&s;s,
or our mi&s;ery, Be&s;ides this power|ful
argument for <HI>keeping the heart with all
diligence</HI> I mu&s;t mention another import|ant
con&s;ideration taken from the pre&s;ent
&s;tate of human nature. Think what your
heart now is, and what mu&s;t be the con&s;e|quence
of remitting your vigilance in watch|ing
over it. With too much ju&s;tice it is
&s;aid in Scripture, to be <HI>deceitful above all
things, and de&s;perately wicked.</HI> Its bias of
innate corruption gives it a perpetual ten|dency
downwards into vice and di&s;order.
To direct and impel it upwards, requires a
con&s;tant effort. Experience may convince
you, that almo&s;t every de&s;ire has a propen|&s;ity
to wander into an improper direction;
that every pa&s;&s;ion tends to exce&s;s; and that
around your imagination there perpetually
crowds a whole &s;warm of vain and cor|rupting
thoughts. After all the care that
can be be&s;towed by the be&s;t men on the
regulation of the heart, it frequently baf|fles
their efforts to keep it under proper
di&s;cipline. Into what univer&s;al tumult
<PB N="37" REF="44">
then mu&s;t it ri&s;e, if no vigilance be em|ployed,
and no government be exerci&s;ed
over it? Inattention and remi&s;&s;ne&s;s is all
that the great adver&s;ary of mankind de|&s;ires,
in order to gain full advantage.
While you <HI>&s;leep, he &s;ows his tares in the
field.</HI> The hou&s;e which he finds vacant
and unguarded, he pre&s;ently <HI>garni&s;hes with
euil &s;pirits.</HI></P>
<P>Add to this, that the human temper is
to be con&s;idered as a &s;y&s;tem, the parts of
which have a mutual dependance on each
other. Introduce di&s;order into any one
part, and you derange the whole. Suffer
but one pa&s;&s;ion to go out of its place, or
to acquire an unnatural force, and pre&s;ently
the balance of the &s;oul will be broken; its
powers will jar among them&s;elves, and their
operations become di&s;cordant. <HI>Keep thy
heart therefore with all diligence;</HI> for all
thy diligence is here required. And though
thine own keeping alone will not avail,
unle&s;s the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of a higher power con|cur,
yet of this be well a&s;&s;ured, that no
aid from heaven is to be expected, if thou
<PB N="38" REF="45">
&s;halt neglect to exert thy &s;elf in perform|ing
the part a&s;&s;igned thee.</P>
<P>HAVING now &s;hown the importance of
exerci&s;ing government over the heart, I
proceed to con&s;ider more particularly in
what that government con&s;i&s;ts, as it re|&s;pects
the thoughts, the pa&s;&s;ions, and the temper.</P>
<P>I begin with the thoughts, which are the
prime movers of the whole human conduct.
All that makes a figure on the great theatre
of the world, the employments of the bu&s;y,
the enterprizes of the ambitious, and the
exploits of the warlike, the virtues which
form the happine&s;e, and the crimes which
occa&s;ion the mi&s;ery of mankind, originate
in that &s;ilent and &s;ecret rece&s;s of thought
which is hidden from every human eye.
The &s;ecre&s;y and &s;ilence which reign there
favour the prejudice entertained by too
many, that thought is exempted from all
controul. Pa&s;&s;ions, they perhaps admit,
require government and re&s;traint, becau&s;e
they are violent emotions and di&s;turb &s;o|ciety.
<PB N="39" REF="46">
But with their thoughts, they plead,
no one is concerned. By the&s;e, as long as
they remain in their bo&s;om, no offence can
be given, and no injury committed. To
enjoy unre&s;trained the full range of imagi|nation,
appears to them the native right
and privilege of man.</P>
<P>Had they to do with none but their
fellow-creatures, &s;uch rea&s;oning might be
&s;pecious. But they ought to remember,
that in the &s;ight of the Supreme Being,
thoughts bear the character of good or evil,
as much as actions; and that they are, in
e&s;pecial manner, the &s;ubjects of divine ju|ri&s;diction,
becau&s;e they are cognizable by
no other tribunal. The moral regulation
of our thoughts, is the particular te&s;t of our
reverence for God. If we re&s;train our pa&s;|&s;ions
from breaking forth into open di&s;or|ders,
while we abandon our imagination
in &s;ecret to corruption, we &s;how that virtue
re&s;ts with us upon regard to men; and
that however we may act a part in public
with propriety, there is before our eyes
no fear of that God who <HI>&s;earcheth the
<PB N="40" REF="47">
heart, <HI>and</HI> requireth truth in the inward
parts.</HI></P>
<P>But even ab&s;tracting from this awful
con&s;ideration, the government of our
thoughts mu&s;t appear to be of high con|&s;equence,
from their direct influence on
conduct. It is plain that thought gives the
fir&s;t impul&s;e to every principle of action.
Actions are, in truth, no other than thoughts
ripened into con&s;i&s;tency and &s;ub&s;tance. So
certain is this, that to judge with preci&s;ion
of the character of any man, and to foretell
with confidence what part he will act, no
more were requi&s;ite, than to be rendered
capable of viewing the current of thought
which pa&s;&s;es mo&s;t frequently within him.
Though by &s;uch a method we have no ac|ce&s;s
to judge of one another, yet thus it is
always in our power to judge of our &s;elves.
Each of us, by impartially &s;crutinizing his
indulged and favourite thoughts, may di&s;|cover
the whole &s;ecret of his real character.
This con&s;ideration alone, is &s;ufficient to
&s;how of what importance the government
of thought is to the <HI>keeping of the heart.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="48">
BUT, &s;uppo&s;ing us convinced of its im|portance,
a que&s;tion may ari&s;e, How far it
is within our power, and in what degree
thoughts are &s;ubject to the command of the
will? It is plain that they are not always
the offspring of choice. Often they are in|evitably
impre&s;&s;ed upon the mind by &s;ur|rounding
objects. Often they &s;tart up, as
of them&s;elves, without any principle of in|troduction
which we are able to trace. <HI>As
the wind bloweth where it li&s;teth, and thou
can&s;t not tell whence it cometh, nor whither
it goeth,</HI> equally rapid in its tran&s;itions,
and in&s;$rutable in its progre&s;s, is the cour&s;e
of thought. Moving along a train of con|nections
which are too delicate for our ob|&s;ervation,
it defeats all endeavours either to
explore or to &s;top its path. Hence vain
and fanta&s;tic imaginations &s;ometimes break
in upon the mo&s;t &s;ettled attention, and di&s;|turb
even the devout exerci&s;es of pious minds.
In&s;tances of this &s;ort mu&s;t be placed
to the account of human frailty. They are
misfortunes to be deplored, rather than
crimes to be condemned; and our gracious
<PB N="42" REF="49">
Creator, who <HI>knows our frame, and remem|bers
we are du&s;t,</HI> will not be &s;evere in mark|ing
every &s;uch error and wandering of the mind.
But, after the&s;e allowances are made,
&s;till there remains much &s;cope for the proper
government of thought; and a multitude of
ca&s;es occur, in which we are no le&s;s ac|countable
for what we think, than for what
we do.</P>
<P>As, fir&s;t, when the introduction of any
train of thought depends upon our&s;elves,
and is our voluntary act; by turning our
attention towards &s;uch objects, awaken|ing
&s;uch pa&s;&s;ions, or engaging in &s;uch
employments as we know mu&s;t give a pe|culiar
determination to our thoughts. Next,
when thoughts, by whatever accident they
may have been originally &s;ugge&s;ted, are in|dulged
with deliberation and complacency.
Though the mind has been pa&s;&s;ive in their
reception, and, therefore, free of blame;
yet, if it be active in their continuance, the
guilt becomes its own. They may have
intruded at fir&s;t, like unbidden gue&s;ts; but
if, when entered, they are made welcome,
<PB N="43" REF="50">
and kindly entertained, the ca&s;e is the &s;ame
as if they had been invited from the begin|ning.
If we be thus accountable to God
for thoughts either voluntarily introduced,
or deliberately indulged, we are no le&s;s &s;o,
in the la&s;t place, for tho&s;e which find ad|mittance
into our hearts from &s;upine negli|gence,
from total relaxation of attention,
from allowing our imagination to rove with
entire licence, <HI>like the eyes of the &s;ool, to|wards
the ends of the earth.</HI> Our minds are,
in this ca&s;e, thrown open to folly and va|nity.
They are pro&s;tituted to every evil
thing which plea&s;es to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. The
con&s;equences mu&s;t all be charged to our ac|count;
and in vain we plead excu&s;e from
human infirmity. Hence it appears, that
the great object at which we are to aim in
governing our thoughts, is, to take the mo&s;t
effectual mea&s;ures for preventing the intro|duction
of &s;uch as are &s;inful, and for ha&s;ten|ing
their expul&s;ion, if they &s;hall have intro|duced
them&s;elves without con&s;ent of the will.</P>
<P>But when we de&s;cend into our brea&s;ts,
and examine how fur we have &s;tudied to
<PB N="44" REF="51">
keep this object in view, who can tell <HI>how
oft he hath offended?</HI> In no article of reli|gion
or morals are men more culpably re|mi&s;s
than in the unre&s;trained indulgence
they give to fancy; and that too, for mo&s;t
part, without remor&s;e. Since the time that
Rea&s;on began to exert her powers, Thought,
during our waking hours, has been active
in every brea&s;t, without a moment's &s;u&s;|pen&s;ion
or pau&s;e. The current of ideas
has been always flowing. The wheels of
the &s;piritual engine have circulated with
perpetual motion. Let me a&s;k what has
been the fruit of this ince&s;&s;ant activity with
the greate&s;t part of mankind? Of the in|numerable
hours that have been employed
in thought, how few are marked with any
permanent or u&s;eful effect? How many
have either pa&s;&s;ed away in idle dreams; or
have been abandoned to anxious di&s;con|tented
mu&s;ings, to un&s;ocial and malignant
pa&s;&s;ions, or to irregular and criminal de|&s;ires?
Had I power to lay open that &s;tore|hou&s;e
of iniquity which the hearts of too
many conceal; could I draw out and read
<PB N="45" REF="52">
of them a li&s;t of all imaginations they
have devi&s;ed, and all the pa&s;&s;ions they have
indulged in &s;ecret; what a picture of men
would I pre&s;ent to them&s;elves? What crimes
would they appear to have perpetrated in
fancy, which to their mo&s;t intimate com|panions
they dur&s;t not reveal?</P>
<P>Even when men imagine their thoughts
to be innocently employed, they too com|monly
&s;uffer them to run out into extrava|gant
imaginations, and chimerical plans of
what they would wi&s;h to attain, or chu&s;e to
be, if they could frame the cour&s;e of things
according to their de&s;ire. Though &s;uch
employments of fancy come not under the
&s;ame de&s;cription with tho&s;e which are plainly
criminal, yet wholly unblameable they &s;el|dom
are. Be&s;ides the wa&s;te of time which
they occa&s;ion, and the mi&s;application which
they indicate of tho&s;e intellectual powers
that were given to us for much nobler pur|po&s;es,
&s;uch romantic &s;peculations lead us
always into the neighbourhood of forbid|den
regions. They place us on dangerous
ground. They are for the mo&s;t part con|nected
<PB N="46" REF="53">
with &s;ome one bad pa&s;&s;ion; and
they always nouri&s;h a giddy and frivolous
turn of thought. They unfit the mind for
applying with vigour to rational pur&s;uits,
or for acquie&s;cing in &s;ober plans of conduct.
From that ideal world in which it allows
it&s;elf to dwell, it returns to the commerce
of men, unbent and relaxed, &s;ickly and
tainted, aver&s;e from di&s;charging the duties,
and &s;ometimes di&s;qualified even for reli&s;h|ing
the plea&s;ures of ordinary life. <HI>O Jeru|&s;alem!
wa&s;h thine heart from wickedne&s;s.
How long &s;hall thy vain thoughts lodge within
thee?</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Jerem. iv. 14.</NOTE>&mdash;In order to guard again&s;t all
&s;uch corruptions and abu&s;es of thought as I
have mentioned, it may be profitable to at|tend
to the following rules.</P>
<P>IN the fir&s;t place, &s;tudy to acquire the
habit of attention to thought. No &s;tudy in
more important; for in proportion to the
degree in which this habit is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, &s;uch
commonly is the degree of intellectual im|provement.
<PB N="47" REF="54">
It is the power of attention
which in a great mea&s;ure di&s;tingui&s;hes the
wi&s;e and the great from the vulgar and
trifling herd of men. The latter are ac|cu&s;tomed
to think, or rather to dream, with|out
knowing the &s;ubject of their thoughts.
In their unconnected rovings, they pur&s;ue
no end; they follow no tract. Every thing
floats loo&s;e and disjointed on the &s;urface of
their mind; like leaves &s;cattered and blown
about on the face of the waters.</P>
<P>In order to lead your thoughts into any
u&s;eful direction, your fir&s;t care mu&s;t be, to
acquire the power of fixing them, and of
re&s;training their irregular motions. Inure
your&s;elves to form a plan of proper medi|tation;
to pur&s;ue it &s;teadily; and with &s;e|vere
authority to keep the door &s;hut again&s;t
intru&s;ions of wandering fancy. Let your
mind, for this purpo&s;e, become a frequent
object to itself. Let your thoughts be made
the &s;ubjects of thought and review.&mdash;&startq;To
what is my attention at pre&s;ent directed?
Could I di&s;clo&s;e it without a blu&s;h to the
world? Were God in&s;tantly to call me
<PB N="48" REF="55">
into judgment, what account could I give
of it to him? Shall I be the wi&s;er or the
better for dwelling on &s;uch thoughts as
now fill my mind? Are they entirely
con&s;i&s;tent with my innocence, and with
my pre&s;ent and future peace? If they
are not, to what purpo&s;e do I indulge
&s;uch unprofitable or dangerous mu&s;ings?&endq;
&mdash;By frequent exerci&s;e of his inward &s;cru|tiny,
we might gradually bring imagination
under di&s;cipline, and turn the powers of
thought to their proper u&s;e as means of im|provement,
in&s;tead of &s;uffering them to be
only the in&s;truments of vanity and guilt.</P>
<P>IN the &s;econd place, in order to the go|vernment
of thought, it is nece&s;&s;ary to guard
again&s;t idlene&s;s. Idlene&s;s is the great fo|menter
of all corruptions in the human
heart. In particular, it is the parent of
loo&s;e imaginations and inordinate de&s;ires.
The ever active and re&s;tle&s;s power of thought,
if not employed about what is good, will
naturally and unavoidably engender evil.
Imagine not that mere occupation, of what|ever
<PB N="49" REF="56">
ever kind it be, will exempt you from the
blame and danger of an idle life. Perhaps
the wor&s;t &s;pecies of idlene&s;s is a di&s;&s;ipated,
though &s;eemingly bu&s;y life, &s;pent in the
haunts of loo&s;e &s;ociety, and in the chace of
perpetual amu&s;ement. Hence a giddy mind,
alternately elated and dejected with trifles,
occupied with no recollection of the pa&s;t
but what is fruitle&s;s, and with no plans for
the future but what are either frivolous or
guilty.</P>
<P>As, therefore, you would govern your
thoughts, or indeed as you would have any
thoughts that are worthy of being governed,
provide honourable employment for the
native activity of your minds. Keep know|ledge,
virtue, and u&s;efulne&s;s, ever in view.
Let your life proceed in a train of &s;uch pur|&s;uits
as are worthy of a Chri&s;tian, of a ra|tional
and a &s;ocial being. While the&s;e are
regularly carried on as the main bu&s;ine&s;s of
life, let amu&s;ement po&s;&s;es&s; no more than its
proper place in the di&s;tribution of your time.
Take particular care that your amu&s;ements
be of an irreproachable kind, and that all
<PB N="50" REF="57">
your &s;ociety be either improving or inno|cent.
So &s;hall the &s;tream of your thoughts
be made to run in a pure channel. Manly
occupations and virtuous principles will ex|pel
the taint which idlene&s;s never fails to
communicate to the vacant mind.</P>
<P>IN the third place, when criminal thoughts
ari&s;e, attend to all the proper methods of
&s;peedily &s;uppre&s;&s;ing them. Take example
from the unhappy indu&s;try which &s;inners
di&s;cover in bani&s;hing good ones, when a
natural &s;en&s;e of religion forces them on their
con&s;cience. How anxiou&s;ly do they fly
from them&s;elves? how &s;tudiou&s;ly do they
drown the voice which upbraids them in
the noi&s;e of company or diver&s;ion? what
numerous artifices do they employ to evade
the unea&s;ine&s;s which returns of reflexion
would produce?&mdash;Were we to u&s;e equal
diligence in preventing the entrance of vi|cious
&s;ugge&s;tions, or in repelling them when
entered, why &s;hould we not be equally &s;uc|ce&s;sful
in a much better cau&s;e?&mdash;As &s;oon as
you are &s;en&s;ible that any dangerous pa&s;&s;ion
<PB N="51" REF="58">
begins to ferment, in&s;tantly call in other
pa&s;&s;ions, and other ideas, to your aid.
Ha&s;ten to turn your thoughts into a differ|ent
direction. Summon up whatever you
have found to be of power for compo&s;ing
and harmonizing your mind. Fly for a&s;|&s;i&s;tance
to &s;erious &s;tudies, to prayer and
devotion; or even fly to bu&s;ine&s;s or inno|cent
&s;ociety, if &s;olitude be in hazard of fa|vouring
the &s;eduction. By &s;uch means you
may &s;top the progre&s;s of the growing evil.
You may apply an antidote, before the
poi&s;on has had time to work its full effect.</P>
<P>IN the fourth place, it will be particularly
u&s;eful to impre&s;s your minds with a habitual
&s;en&s;e of the pre&s;ence of the Almighty. When
we reflect what a &s;trong check the belief of
divine omni&s;cience is calculated to give to
all criminal thoughts, we are tempted to
&s;u&s;pect, that even by Chri&s;tians this article
of faith is not received with &s;incere convic|tion.
For who but mu&s;t confe&s;s, that if he
knew a parent, a friend, or a neighbour, to
have the power of looking into his heart,
<PB N="52" REF="59">
he dur&s;t not allow him&s;elf that unbounded
&s;cope which he now gives to his imagination
and de&s;ire? Whence, then, comes it to pa&s;s,
that men, without fear or concern, bring into
the pre&s;ence of the awful maje&s;ty of Heaven
that folly and licentiou&s;ne&s;s of thought
which would make them blu&s;h and tremble,
if one of their own fellow-creatures could
de&s;ery? At the &s;ame time, no principle is
&s;upported by clearer evidence than the om|ni&s;cience
of God. All religious &s;ects have
admitted it. All &s;ocieties of men, in their
oaths and covenants, appeal to it. The
&s;overign of the univer&s;e cannot but know
what pa&s;&s;es throughout his dominions. He
who &s;upports all nature mu&s;t needs pervade
and fill it. He who formed the heart is
certainly con&s;cious to what pa&s;&s;es within it.</P>
<P>Never let this great article of faith e&s;cape
from your view. In thinking, as well as
in acting, accu&s;tom your&s;elves to look up
with reverence to that piercing eye of di|vine
ob&s;ervation which <HI>never &s;lumbers nor
&s;leeps.</HI> Behold a pen always writing over
your head, and making up that great re|cord
<PB N="53" REF="60">
of your thoughts, words, and actions,
from which at la&s;t you are to be judged.
Think that you are never le&s;s alone than
when by your&s;elves; for then is He &s;till
with you, who&s;e in&s;pection is of greater
con&s;equence than that of all mankind.
Let the&s;e awful con&s;iderations not only
check the di&s;&s;ipation of corrupt fancy, but
infu&s;e into your &s;pirits that &s;olemn com|po&s;ure
which is the parent of meditation
and wi&s;dom. Let them not only expel
what is evil, but introduce in its &s;tead what
is pure and holy; elevating your thoughts
to divine and eternal objects, and acting as
the counterpoi&s;e to tho&s;e attractions of the
world, which would draw your whole at|tention
downwards to &s;en&s;e and vanity.</P>

<P>Pa&s;&s;ions are &s;trong emotions of the mind,
occa&s;ioned by the view of apprehended
good or evil. They are original parts of
the con&s;titution of our nature; and there|fore,
to extirpate them is a mi&s;taken aim.
Religion requires no more of us than to
<PB N="55" REF="62">
moderate and rule them. When our ble&s;|&s;ed
Lord a&s;&s;umed the nature, without the
corruption, of man, he was &s;ubject to like
pa&s;&s;ions with us. On &s;ome occa&s;ions he

he &s;orrwed and he wept.</P>
<P>Pa&s;&s;ions, when properly directed, may
be &s;ub&s;ervient to every u&s;eful ends. They
rouze the dormant powers of the &s;oul.
They are even found to exalt them. They
often rai&s;e a man above him&s;elf, and ren|der
him more penetrating, vigorous, and
ma&s;terly, than he is in his calmer hours.
Actuated by &s;ome high pa&s;&s;ion, he conceives
great de&s;igns, and &s;urmounts all difficulties
in the execution. He is in&s;pired with more
lofty &s;entiments, and endowed with more
per&s;ua&s;ive utterance, than he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es at
any other time. Pa&s;&s;ions are the active
forces of the &s;oul. They are its highe&s;t
powers brought into movement and exer|tion.
But, like all other great powers, they
are either u&s;eful or de&s;tructive, according to
their direction and degree: as wind and
<PB N="56" REF="63">
are in&s;trumental in carrying on many
of the beneficent operations of nature; but
when they ri&s;e to undue violence, or devi|ate
from their proper cour&s;e, their path is
marked with ruin.</P>
<P>It is the pre&s;ent infelicity of human na|ture,
that tho&s;e &s;trong emotions of the mind
are become too powerful for the principle
which ought to regulate them. This is one
of the unhappy con&s;equences of our apo&s;|tacy
from God, that the influence of rea|&s;on
is weakened, and that of pa&s;&s;ion
&s;trengthened, within the heart. When man
revolted from his Maker, his pa&s;&s;ions re|belled
again&s;t him&s;elf; and from being
originally the in&s;truments of rea&s;on, have
become the tyrants of the &s;oul. Hence, in
treating of this &s;ubject, two things may be
a&s;&s;umed as principles: fir&s;t, that through
the pre&s;ent weakne&s;s of the under&s;tanding,
our pa&s;&s;ions are often directed towards im|proper
objects; and next, that even when
their direction is ju&s;t, and their objects are
innocent, they perpetually tend to run into
exce&s;s: they always hurry us towards their
<PB N="57" REF="64">
gratification with a blind and dangerous
impetuo&s;ity. On the&s;e two points then
turns the whole government of our pa&s;&s;ions:
fir&s;t, to a&s;certain the proper objects of their
pur&s;uit; and next, to re&s;train them in that
pur&s;uit when they would carry us beyond
the bounds of rea&s;on. If there be any pa&s;|&s;ion
which intrudes it&s;elf un&s;ea&s;onably into
our mind, which darkens and troubles our
judgment, or habitually di&s;compo&s;es our
temper; which unfits us for properly di&s;|charging
the duties, or di&s;qualifies us for
cheerfully enjoying the comforts of life,
we may certainly conclude it to have gained
a dangerous a&s;cendant. The great object
which we ought to propo&s;e to our&s;elves is,
to acquire a firm and &s;tedfa&s;t mind, which
the infatuation of pa&s;&s;ion &s;hall not &s;educe,
nor its violence &s;hake; which, re&s;ting on
fixed principles, &s;hall, in the mid&s;t of con|tending
emotions, remain free, and ma&s;ter
of it&s;elf; able to li&s;ten calmly to the voice
of con&s;cience, and prepared to obey its dic|tates
without he&s;itation.</P>
<P><PB N="58" REF="65">
To obtain, if po&s;&s;ible, &s;uch command of
pa&s;&s;ion, is one of the highe&s;t attainments
of the rational nature. Arguments to &s;how
its importance crowd upon us from every
quarter. If there be any fertile &s;ource of
mi&s;chief to human life, it is, beyond doubt,
the mi&s;rule of pa&s;&s;ion. It is this which
poi&s;ons the enjoyment of individuals, over|turns
the order of &s;ociety, and &s;trews the
path of life with &s;o many mi&s;eries, as to
render it indeed the valley of tears. All
tho&s;e great &s;cenes of public calamity, which
we behold with a&s;toni&s;hment and horrour,
have originated from the &s;ource of violent
pa&s;&s;ions. The&s;e have over&s;pread the earth
with blood&s;hed. The&s;e have pointed the
a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in's dagger, and filled the poi&s;oned
bowl. The&s;e, in every age, have fur|ni&s;hed
too copious materials for the orator's
pathetic declamation, and for the poet's tra|gical
&s;ong.</P>
<P>When from public life we de&s;cend to pri|vate
conduct, though pa&s;&s;ion operate not
there in &s;uch a wide and de&s;tructive &s;phere,
we &s;hall find its influence to be no le&s;s baneful.
<PB N="59" REF="66">
I need not mention the black and
fierce pa&s;&s;ions, &s;uch as envy, jealou&s;y, and
revenge, who&s;e effects are obviou&s;ly nox|ious,
and who&s;e agitations are Immediate
mi&s;ery. But take any of the licentious and
&s;en&s;ual kind. Suppo&s;e it to have unlimited
&s;cope; trace it throughout its cour&s;e; and
you will find that gradually, as it ri&s;es, it
taints the &s;oundne&s;s, and troubles the peace
of his mind over whom it reigns; that in
its progre&s;s it engages him in pur&s;uits which
are marked either with danger or with
&s;hame; that in the end it wa&s;tes his for|tune,
de&s;troys his health, or deba&s;es his
character; and aggravates all the mi&s;eries
in which it has involved him with the con|cluding
pangs of bitter remor&s;e. Through
all the &s;tages of this fatal cour&s;e, how many
have heretofore run? What multitudes do
we daily behold pur&s;uing it, with blind and
headlong &s;teps?</P>
<P>But, on the evils which flow from unre|&s;trained
pa&s;&s;ions, it is needle&s;s to enlarge.
Hardly are there any &s;o ignorant or incon|&s;iderate
as not to admit, that where pa&s;&s;ion
<PB N="60" REF="67">
is allowed to reign, both happine&s;s and vir|tue
mu&s;t &s;uffer. I proceed therefore to
what is of more con&s;equence, to &s;ugge&s;t
&s;ome directions which may be u&s;eful in
a&s;&s;i&s;ting us to pre&s;erve the government of
our pa&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>IN the fir&s;t place, we mu&s;t &s;tudy to ac|quire
ju&s;t views of the comparative import|ance
of tho&s;e objects that are mo&s;t ready to
attract de&s;ire. The erroneous opinions
which we form concerning happine&s;s and
mi&s;ery, give ri&s;e to all the mi&s;taken and
dangerous pa&s;&s;ions which embroil our life.
We &s;uffer our&s;elves to be dazzled by unreal
appearances of plea&s;ure. We follow, with
precipitancy, whither&s;oerver the crowd
leads. We admire, without examination,
what our predece&s;&s;ors have admired. We
fly from every &s;hadow at which we &s;ee
others tremble. Thus, agitated by vain
fears and deceitful hopes, we are hurried
into eager conte&s;ts about objects which are
in them&s;elves of no value. By rectifying our
opinions, we would &s;trike at the root
<PB N="61" REF="68">
of the evil. If our vain imaginations were
cha&s;tened, the tumult of our pa&s;&s;ions would
&s;ub&s;ide.</P>
<P>It is ob&s;erved, that the young and the
ignorant are always the mo&s;t violent in
pur&s;uit. The knowledge which is forced
upon them by longer acquaintance with the
world, moderates their impetuo&s;ity. Study
then to anticipate, by reflexion, that know|ledge
which experience often purcha&s;es at
too dear a price. Inure your&s;elves to fre|quent
con&s;ideration of the emptine&s;s of
tho&s;e plea&s;ures which excite &s;o much &s;trife
and commotion among mankind. Think
how much more of true enjoyment is lo&s;t
by the violence of pa&s;&s;ion, than by the want
of tho&s;e things which give occa&s;ion to that
pa&s;&s;ion. Per&s;uade your&s;elves that the fa|vour
of God and the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of virtue
form the chief happine&s;s of the rational
nature. Let a contented mind, and a
peaceful life, hold the next place in your
e&s;timation. The&s;e are the conclu&s;ions
which the wi&s;e and thinking part of man|kind
have always formed. To the&s;e con|clu&s;ions,
<PB N="62" REF="69">
after having run the race of pa&s;|&s;ion,
you will probably come at the la&s;t.
By forming them betimes, you would make
a &s;ea&s;onable e&s;cape from that tempe&s;tuous
region, through which none can pa&s;s with|out
&s;uffering mi&s;ery, contracting guilt, and
undergoing &s;evere remor&s;e.</P>
<P>IN the &s;econd place, in order to attain
the command of pa&s;&s;ion, it is requi&s;ite to
acquire the power of &s;elf-denial. The &s;elf|denial
of a Chri&s;tian con&s;i&s;ts not in perpe|tual
au&s;terity of life, and univer&s;al renun|ciation
of the innocent comforts of the
world. Religion requires no &s;uch unne|ce&s;&s;ary
&s;acrifices, nor is any &s;uch foe to
pre&s;ent enjoyment. It con&s;i&s;ts in our being
ready, on proper occa&s;ions, to ab&s;tain from
plea&s;ure, or to &s;ubmit to &s;uffering, for the
&s;ake of duty and con&s;cience, or from a view
to &s;ome higher and more exten&s;ive good.
If we po&s;&s;e&s;s not this power, we &s;hall be
the prey of every loo&s;e inclination that
chances to ari&s;e. Pampered by continual
indulgence, all our pa&s;&s;ions will become
<PB N="63" REF="70">
mutinous and head&s;trong. De&s;ire, not rea|&s;on,
will be the ruling principle of our
conduct.</P>
<P>As, therefore, you would keep your pa&s;|&s;ions
within due bounds, you mu&s;t betimes
accu&s;tom them to know the reins. You
mu&s;t not wait till &s;ome critical occa&s;ion for
the exerci&s;e of &s;elf-denial occur. In vain
you will attempt to act with authority, if
your fir&s;t e&s;&s;ay be made when temptation
has inflamed the mind. In cooler hours,
you mu&s;t &s;ometimes abridge your enjoy|ment
even of what is innocent. In the
mid&s;t of lawful plea&s;ure, you mu&s;t main|tain
moderation, ab&s;temiou&s;ne&s;s, and &s;elf|command.
The ob&s;ervance of this di&s;ci|pline
is the only method of &s;upporting rea|&s;on
in its proper a&s;cendant. For if you
allow your&s;elves always to &s;tretch to the
utmo&s;t point of innocence and &s;afety, be|yond
that point you will infallibly be hur|ried,
when pa&s;&s;ion &s;hall ari&s;e in its might
to &s;hake the heart.</P>
<P>IN the third place, impre&s;s your minds
deeply with this per&s;ua&s;ion, that nothing is
<PB N="64" REF="71">
what it appears to be when you are under
the power of pa&s;&s;ion. Be a&s;&s;ured, that no
judgment which you then form can be in
the lea&s;t depended upon as &s;ound or true.
The fumes which ari&s;e from a heart boiling
with violent pa&s;&s;ions, never fail to darken
and trouble the under&s;tanding. When the
gourd withered, under the &s;hade of which
the prophet Jonah repo&s;ed, his mind, al|ready
ruffled by the di&s;appointment of his
predictions, lo&s;t, on occa&s;ion of this &s;light
incident, all command of it&s;elf; and in the
mid&s;t of his impatience, he <HI>wi&s;hed to die
rather than to live.</HI> In&s;tead of being calmed
by that expo&s;tulating voice, <HI>Do&s;t thou well,
O Jonah! to be angry becau&s;e of the gourd?</HI>
he replied with great emotion, <HI>I do well to
be angry even unto death.</HI> But did Jonah
think &s;o when his pa&s;&s;ion had abated? Do
the&s;e &s;entiments bear the lea&s;t re&s;emblance
to that humble and devout prayer which,
on another occa&s;ion, when in his calm mind,
he put up to God<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">See Jonah ii.</NOTE>? No two per&s;ons can
differ more from each other, than the &s;ame
<PB N="65" REF="72">
per&s;on differs from him&s;elf, when agitated
by pa&s;&s;ion, and when ma&s;ter of his rea&s;on.
<HI>I do well to be angry,</HI> is the language of
every man when his mind is inflamed.
Every pa&s;&s;ion ju&s;tifies it&s;elf. It brings in a
thou&s;and pretences to its aid. It borrows
many a fal&s;e colour to hide its deformity.
It po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es a &s;ort of magic, by which it can
magnify or diminish objects at plea&s;ure,
and transform the appearance of every thing
within its &s;phere.</P>
<P>Let the knowledge of this impo&s;ture which
pa&s;&s;ion practi&s;es, place you continually on
your guard. Let the remembrance of it
be ever at hand, to check the extravagant
judgments which you are apt to pa&s;s in
tho&s;e moments of delu&s;ion. Li&s;ten to no
&s;ugge&s;tion which then ari&s;es. Form no
conclusions on which you are to act. A&s;|&s;ure
your&s;elves that every thing is beheld
through a fal&s;e medium. Have patience
for a little, and the illu&s;ion will vani&s;h;
the atmo&s;phere will clear up around you,
and objects return to be viewed in their
native colours and ju&s;t dimen&s;ions.</P>
<P><PB N="66" REF="73">
IN the fourth place, oppo&s;e early the be|ginnings
of pa&s;&s;ion. Avoid particularly all
&s;uch objects as are apt to excite pa&s;&s;ions
which you know to predominate within
you. As &s;oon as you find the tempe&s;t ri&s;ing,
have recourse to every proper method, ei|ther
of allaying its violence, or of e&s;caping
to a calmer &s;hore. Ha&s;ten to call up emo|tions
of an oppo&s;ite nature. Study to con|quer
one pa&s;&s;ion by means of &s;ome other
which is of le&s;s dangerous tendency. Never
account any thing &s;mall or trivial which is
in hazard of introducing di&s;order into your
heart. Never make light of any de&s;ire
which you feel gaining &s;uch progre&s;s as to
threaten entire dominion. Blandi&s;hing it
will appear at the fir&s;t. As a gentle and
innocent emotion, it may &s;teal into the
heart; but as it advances, is likely to <HI>pierce
you through with many &s;orrows.</HI> What you
indulged as a favourite amu&s;ement, will
&s;hortly become a &s;erious bu&s;ine&s;s; and in
the end may prove the burden of your life.
Mo&s;t of our pa&s;&s;ions flatter us in their ri&s;e.
But their beginnings are treacherous; their
<PB N="67" REF="74">
growth is imperceptible; and the evils which
they carry in their train lie concealed, until
their dominion is e&s;tabli&s;hed. What Solo|mon
&s;ays of one of them, holds true of them
all, that their <HI>beginning is as when one letteth
out water</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Prov. xvii. 14.</NOTE>. It i&s;&s;ues from a &s;mall chink,
which once might have been ea&s;ily &s;topped;
but being neglected, it is &s;oon widened by
the &s;tream; till the bank is at la&s;t totally
thrown down, and the flood is at liberty to
deluge the whole plain.</P>
<P>IN the fifth place, the exce&s;s of every
pa&s;&s;ion will be moderated by frequent me|ditation
on the vanity of the world, the
&s;hort continuance of life, the approach of
death, judgment, and eternity. The ima|ginary
degree of importance which the ne|glect
of &s;uch meditation &s;uffers us to be&s;tow
on temporal things, is one great cau&s;e of
our vehemence in de&s;ire, and our eagerne&s;s
in pur&s;uit. We attach our&s;elves to the ob|jects
around us, as if we could enjoy them
for ever. Higher and more enlarged pro|&s;pects
<PB N="68" REF="75">
of the de&s;tination of man would na|turally
cool this mi&s;placed ardour. For
what can appear &s;o con&s;iderable in human
affairs, as to di&s;compo&s;e or agitate the mind
of him to who&s;e view eternity lies open, and
all the greatne&s;s of the univer&s;e of God?
How contemptible will &s;eem to him this
hurry of &s;pirits, this turmoil of pa&s;&s;ion,
about things which are &s;o &s;oon to end?&mdash;
Where are they who once di&s;turbed the
world with the violence of their conte&s;ts,
and filled it with the renown of their ex|ploits?
What now remains of their de&s;igns
and enterpri&s;es, of their pa&s;&s;ions and pur|&s;uits,
of their triumphs and their glory?
The flood of time has pa&s;&s;ed over them,
and &s;wept them away, as if they had never
been. The <HI>fa&s;hion of the world</HI> changes
continually around us. We &s;ucceed one
another in the human cour&s;e, like troops
of pilgrims on their journey. Ab&s;urdly we
&s;pend our time in contending about the
trifles of a day, while we ought to be pre|paring
for a higher exi&s;tence. Eternity is
ju&s;t as band to clo&s;e this introductory &s;eene.
<PB N="69" REF="76">
It is fa&s;t rolling towards us, like the tide
of a va&s;t ocean, ready to &s;wallow up all
human concerns, and to leave no trace be|hind
it, except the con&s;equences of our good
or bad deeds, which &s;hall la&s;t for ever.&mdash;
Let &s;uch reflections allay the heat of pa&s;&s;ion.
Let them reduce all human things to their
proper &s;tandard. From frivolous pur&s;uits
let them recal our attention to objects of
real importance; to the proper bu&s;ine&s;s of
man; to the improvement of our nature,
the di&s;charge of our duty, the rational and
religious conduct of human life.</P>
<P>IN the la&s;t place, to our own endeavours
for regulating our pa&s;&s;ions, let us join ear|ne&s;t
prayer to God. Here, if any where,
divine a&s;&s;i&s;tance is requisite. For &s;uch is
the pre&s;ent blindne&s;s and imperfection of
human nature, that even to di&s;cover all the
di&s;orders of our heart is become difficult;
much more, to rectify them, is beyond our
power. To that &s;uperior aid, then, which
is promi&s;ed to the pious and upright, let us
look up with humble minds; be&s;eeching
<PB N="70" REF="77">
the Father of mercies, that, while we &s;tudy
to act our own part with re&s;olution and
vigilance, he would forgive our returning
weakne&s;s; would &s;trengthen our con&s;tancy
in re&s;i&s;ting the a&s;&s;aults of pa&s;&s;ion; and enable
us by his grace &s;o to govern our minds, that
without con&s;iderable interruptions we may
proceed in a cour&s;e of piety and virtue.</P>
<P>IT now remains to treat of the govern|ment
of temper, as included in the <HI>keeping
of the heart.</HI> Pa&s;&s;ions are quick and &s;trong
emotions, which by degrees &s;ub&s;ide. Tem|per
is the di&s;po&s;ition which remains after
the&s;e emotions are pa&s;t, and which forms
the habitual propen&s;ity of the &s;oul. The
one are like the &s;tream when it is &s;woln by
the torrent, and ruffled by the winds. The
other re&s;embles it when running within its
bed, with its natural velocity and force.
The influence of temper is more &s;ilent and
imperceptible than that of pa&s;&s;ion. It ope|rates
with le&s;s violence; but as its operation
is con&s;tant, it produces effects no le&s;s con|&s;iderable.
It is evident, therefore, that it
<PB N="71" REF="78">
highly de&s;erves to be con&s;idered in a reli|gious
view.</P>
<P>Many, indeed, are aver&s;e to behold it in
this light. They place a good temper upon
the &s;ame footing with a healthy con&s;titu|tion
of body. They con&s;ider it as a natural
felicity which &s;ome enjoy; but for the want
of which, others are not morally culpable,
nor accountable to God; and hence the
opinion has &s;ometimes prevailed, that a bad
temper might be con&s;i&s;tent with a &s;tate of
grace. If this were true, it would overturn
that whole doctrine, of which the go&s;pel is
&s;o full, that regeneration, or change of na|ture,
is the e&s;&s;ential characteri&s;tic of a Chri&s;|tian.
It would &s;uppo&s;e that grace might
dwell amid&s;t malevolence and rancour, and
that heaven might be enjoyed by &s;uch as
are &s;trangers to charity and love.&mdash;It will
readily be admitted, that &s;ome, by the ori|ginal
frame of their mind, are more favour|ably
inclined than others towards certain
good di&s;po&s;itions and habits. But this af|fords
no ju&s;tification to tho&s;e who neglect
to oppo&s;e the corruptions to which they are
<PB N="72" REF="79">
prone, Let no man imagine that the hu|man
heart is a &s;oil altogether un&s;u&s;ceptible
of culture; or that the wor&s;t temper may
not, through the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of grace, be re|formed
by attention and di&s;cipline. Settled
depravity of temper is always owing to our
own indulgence. If, in place of checking,
we nouri&s;h that malignity of di&s;po&s;ition to
which we are inclined, all the con&s;equences
will be placed to our account, and every
excu&s;e from natural con&s;titution be rejected
at the tribunal of Heaven.</P>
<P>The proper regulation of temper affects
the character of man in every relation which
he bears; and includes the whole circle of
religious and moral duties. This, therefore,
is a &s;ubject of too great extent to be com|prehended
in one di&s;cour&s;e. But it may be
u&s;eful to tike a general view of it; and, be|fore
we conclude the doctrine of <HI>keeping the
heart,</HI> to &s;hew what the habitual temper of
a good man ought to be, with re&s;pect to
God, to his neighbour, and to him&s;elf.</P>
<P>FIRST, with re&s;pect to God, what he
ought to cultivate is a devout temper. This
<PB N="73" REF="80">
imports more than the care of perform|ing
the offices of religious wor&s;hip. It
denotes that &s;en&s;ibility of heart towards
the Supreme Being, which &s;prings from
a deep impre&s;&s;ion of his perfections on
the &s;oul. It &s;tands oppo&s;ed, not only
to that di&s;regard of God which forms
the de&s;cription of the impious, but to
that ab&s;ence of religious affections which
&s;ometimes prevails among tho&s;e who are
imperfectly good. They acknowledge, per|haps,
the obligations of duty. They feel
&s;ome concern to <HI>work out their &s;alvation.</HI>
But they apply to their duty through mere
con&s;traint; and &s;erve God without affection
or complacency, More liberal and gene|rous
&s;entiments animate the man who is of
devout temper. God dwells upon his
thoughts as a benefactor and a father, to
who&s;e voice he hearkens with joy. Amid&s;t
the occurrences of life, his mind naturally
opens to the admiration of his wi&s;dom, the
reverence of his power, the love of his
tran&s;cendent goodne&s;s. All nature appears
to his view as &s;tamped with the impre&s;s of
<PB N="74" REF="81">
the&s;e perfections. Habitual gratitude to
his Maker for mercies pa&s;t, and cheerful
re&s;ignation to this will in all time to come,
are the native effu&s;ions of his heart.</P>
<P>Such a temper as this de&s;erves to be cul|tivated
with the utmo&s;t attention; for it
contributes, in a high degree, both to our
improvement and our happine&s;s. It re&s;ines,
and it exalts human nature. It &s;oftens that
hardne&s;s which our hearts are ready to con|tract
from frequent intercour&s;e with this
rugged world. It facilitates the di&s;charge
of every duty towards God and man. At
the &s;ame time it is a temper peaceful and
&s;erene, elevated and rejoicing. It forms
the current of our affections to flow in a
placid tenour. It opens plea&s;ing pro&s;pects
to the mind. It bani&s;hes har&s;h and bitter
pa&s;&s;ions; and places us above the reach of
many of the annoyances of worldly life.
When the temper is truly devout, <HI>the peace
of God which pa&s;&s;eth under&s;tanding keepeth
the heart and &s;oul.</HI> I proceed,</P>
<P>SECONDLY, to point out the proper &s;tate
of our temper with re&s;pect to one another.
<PB N="75" REF="82">
It is evident, in the general, that if we
con&s;ult either public welfare or private
happine&s;s, Chri&s;tian charity ought to regu|late
our di&s;po&s;ition in mutual intercour&s;e.
But as this great principle admits of &s;everal
diver&s;ified appearances, let us con&s;ider &s;ome
of the chief forms under which it ought to
&s;how it&s;elf in the u&s;ual tenour of life. Uni|ver&s;al
benevolence to mankind, when it
re&s;ts in the ab&s;tract, is a loo&s;e indetermi|nate
idea, rather than a principle of real
effect; and too often floats as an u&s;ele&s;s
&s;peculation in the head, in&s;tead of affecting
the temper and the heart.</P>
<P>What, fir&s;t, pre&s;ents it&s;elf to be recom|mended
is a peaceable temper; a di&s;po&s;i|tion
aver&s;e to give offence, and de&s;irous of
cultivating harmony, and amicable inter|cour&s;e
in &s;ociety. This &s;uppo&s;es yielding
and conde&s;cending manners, unwillingne&s;s
to contend with others about trifles, and,
in conte&s;ts that are unavoidable, proper
moderation of &s;pirit. Such a temper is the
fir&s;t principle of &s;elf-enjoyment. It is the
ba&s;is of all order and happine&s;s among
<PB N="76" REF="83">
mankind. The po&s;itive and contentious,
the rude and quarrel&s;ome, are the bane of
&s;ociety. They &s;eem de&s;tined to bla&s;t the
&s;mall &s;hare of comfort which nature has
here allotted to man. But they cannot di&s;|turb
the peace of others, more than they
break their own. The hurricane rages fir&s;t
in their own bo&s;om, before it is let forth
upon the world. In the tempe&s;ts which
they rai&s;e, they are always to&s;t; and fre|quently
it is their lot to peri&s;h.</P>
<P>A peaceable temper mu&s;t be &s;upported by
a candid one, or a dispo&s;ition to view the
conduct of others with fairne&s;s and impar|tiality.
This &s;tands oppo&s;ed to a jealous
and &s;u&s;picious temper, which a&s;cribes every
action to the wor&s;t motive, and throws a
black &s;hade over every character. As you
would be happy in your&s;elves, or in your
connections with others, guard again&s;t this
malignant &s;pirit. Study that charity <HI>which
thinketh no evil;</HI> that temper which, with|out
degenerating into credulity, will di&s;po&s;e
you to be ju&s;t; and which can allow you
to ob&s;erve an error, without imputing it as
<PB N="77" REF="84">
a crime. Thus you will be kept free from
that continual irritation which imaginary
injuries rai&s;e in a &s;u&s;picious brea&s;t; and will
walk among men as your brethren, not
your enemies.</P>
<P>But to be peaceable, and to be candid,
is not all that is required of a good man.
He mu&s;t cultivate a kind, generous, and
&s;ympathizing temper, which feels for di&s;|tre&s;s,
wherever it is beheld; which enters
into the concerns of his friends with ar|dour;
and to all with whom he has inter|cour&s;e
is gentle, obliging, and humane.
How amiable appears &s;uch a di&s;po&s;ition,
when contra&s;ted with a malicious or envi|ous
temper, which wraps it&s;elf up in its
own narrow intere&s;ts, looks with an evil
eye on the &s;ucce&s;s of others, and with an
unnatural &s;atisfaction feeds on their di&s;ap|pointments
or mi&s;eries! How little does
he know of the true happine&s;s of life, who
is a &s;tranger to that intercour&s;e of good
offices and kind affections, which, by a
plea&s;ing charm, attach men to one another,
and circulate joy from heart to heart!</P>
<P><PB N="78" REF="85">
You are not to imagine that a benevo|lent
temper finds no exerci&s;e, unle&s;s when
opportunities offer of performing actions of
high genero&s;ity, or of exten&s;ive utility.
The&s;e may &s;eldom occur. The condition
of the greater part of mankind, in a good
mea&s;ure, precludes them. But in the or|dinary
round of human affairs, a thou&s;and
occa&s;ions daily pre&s;ent them&s;elves of miti|gating
the vexations which others &s;uffer, of
&s;oothing their minds, of aiding their in|tere&s;t,
of promoting their cheerfulne&s;s, or
ea&s;e. Such occa&s;ions may relate to the
&s;maller incidents of life. But let us re|member
that of &s;mall incidents the &s;y&s;tem
of human life is chiefly compo&s;ed. The
attentions which re&s;pect the&s;e, when &s;ug|ge&s;ted
by real benignity of temper, are
often more material to the happine&s;s of
tho&s;e around us, than actions which carry
the appearance of greater dignity and &s;plen|dour.
No wi&s;e or good man ought to ac|count
any rules of behaviour as below his
regard, which tend to cement the great
brotherhood of mankind in comfortable
union.</P>
<P><PB N="79" REF="86">
Particularly in the cour&s;e of that fami|liar
intercour&s;e which belongs to dome&s;tic
life, all the virtues of temper find an ample
range. It is very unfortunate, that within
that circle, men too often think them&s;elves
at liberty to give unre&s;trained vent to the
caprice of pa&s;&s;ion and humour. whereas
there, on the contrary, more than any
where, it concerns them to attend to the
government of their heart; to check what
is violent in their tempers, and to &s;often
what is har&s;h in their manners. For there
the temper is formed. There, the real
character di&s;plays it&s;elf. The forms of the
world di&s;gui&s;e men when abroad. But
within his own family, every man is known
to be what he truly is.&mdash;In all our inter|cour&s;e,
then, with others, particularly in
that which is clo&s;e&s;t and mo&s;t intimate, let
us cultivate a peaceable, a candid, a gentle
and friendly temper. This is the temper
to which, by repeated injunctions, our holy
religion &s;eeks to form us. This was the
temper of Chri&s;t. This is the temper of
Heaven.</P>
<P><PB N="80" REF="87">
WE are now to con&s;ider, thirdly, the
proper &s;tate of temper, as it re&s;pects the
individual him&s;elf. The ba&s;is of all the
good di&s;po&s;itions which belong to this head,
is humility. By this I under&s;tand, not that
meanne&s;s of &s;pirit which leads a man to
undervalue him&s;elf, and to &s;ink below his
rank and character; but what the &s;cripture
expre&s;&s;es with great propriety, when it ex|horts
<HI>every man, not to think of him&s;elf more
highly than be ought to think, out to think
&s;oberly</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Rom. xii. 3.</NOTE>. He who adopts all the flattering
&s;ugge&s;tions of &s;elf-love, and forms claims
upon the world proportioned to the ima|ginary
opinion which he has conceived of
his merit, is preparing for him&s;elf a thou|&s;and
morti&s;ications. Whereas by checking
the ri&s;ings of ill-founded vanity, and re|treating
within tho&s;e bounds which a mo|derate
e&s;timation of our character pre|&s;cribes,
we e&s;cape the mi&s;eries which always
pur&s;ue an arrogant mind, and recommend
our&s;elves to the favour both of God and
man.</P>
<P><PB N="81" REF="88">
Hence will naturally ari&s;e a contented
temper, which is one of the greate&s;t ble&s;|&s;ings
that can be enjoyed by man, and one
of the mo&s;t material requi&s;ites to the pro|per
di&s;charge of the duties of every &s;tation.
For a fretful and di&s;contented temper ren|ders
one incapable of performing aright any
part in life. It is unthankful and impious
towards God; and towards men, provok|ing
and unju&s;t. It is a gangrene which
preys on the vitals, and infects the whole
con&s;titution with di&s;ea&s;e and putrefaction.
Subdue pride and vanity, and you will
take the mo&s;t effectual method of eradicat|ing
this di&s;temper. You will no longer
behold the objects around you with jaun|diced
eyes. You will take in good part
the ble&s;&s;ings which Providence is plea&s;ed to
be&s;tow, and the degree of favour which
your fellow-creatures are di&s;po&s;ed to grant
you. Viewing your&s;elves, with all your
imperfections and failings, in a ju&s;t light,
you will rather be &s;urpri&s;ed at your enjoy|ing
&s;o many good things, than di&s;contented
becau&s;e there are any which you want.</P>
<P><PB N="82" REF="89">
From a humble and contented temper
will &s;pring a cheerful one. This, if not
in it&s;elf a virtue, is at lea&s;t the garb in
which virtue &s;hould be always arrayed.
Piety and goodne&s;s ought never to be mark|ed
with that dejection which &s;ometimes
takes ri&s;e from &s;uper&s;tition, but which is
the proper portion only of guilt. At the
&s;ame time, the cheerfulne&s;s belonging to
virtue is to be carefully di&s;tingui&s;hed from
that light and giddy temper which charac|terizes
folly, and is &s;o often found among
the di&s;&s;ipated and vicious part of mankind.
Their gaiety is owing to a total want of
reflexion; and brings with it the u&s;ual con|&s;equences
of an unthinking habit, &s;hame,
remor&s;e, and heavine&s;s of heart, in the end.
The cheerfulne&s;s of a well-regulated mind,
&s;prings from a good con&s;cience and the fa|vour
of heaven, and is bounded by tem|perance
and rea&s;on. It makes a man
happy in him&s;elf, and promotes the hap|pine&s;s
of all around him. It is the clear
and calm &s;un&s;hine of a mind illuminated by
piety and virtue. It crowns all other good
<PB N="83" REF="90">
di&s;po&s;itions, and comprehends the general
effect which they ought to produce on the
heart.</P>
<P>SUCH, on the whole, is the temper, or
habitual frame of mind, in a good man:
Devout towards God; towards men, peace|able,
candid, affectionate and humane;
within him&s;elf, humble, contented and
cheerful. To the e&s;tabli&s;hment of this hap|py
temper all the directions which I before
&s;ugge&s;ted for the due regulation of the
thoughts, and for the government of the
pa&s;&s;ions, naturally conduce; in this they
ought to i&s;&s;ue; and when this temper is
thoroughly formed within us, then may
the heart be e&s;teemed to have been <HI>kept
with all diligence.</HI> That we may be thus
enabled to keep it, for the &s;ake both of pre|&s;ent
enjoyment and of preparation for
greater happine&s;s, let us earne&s;tly pray to
Heaven. A greater ble&s;&s;ing we cannot
implore of the Almighty, than that he
who made the human heart, and who
knows its frailties, would a&s;&s;i&s;t us to &s;ub|ject

it to that di&s;cipline which religion re|quires,

of Lights, with whom is no variablene&s;s,
neither &s;hadow of turning.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE divine nature<NOTE PLACE="marg">SERM. IV.</NOTE>, in &s;ome views,
attracts our love; in others, com|mands
our reverence; in all, is entitled to
the highe&s;t attention from the human mind.
We never elevate our thoughts, in a pro|per
manner, towards the Supreme Being,
without returning to our own &s;phere with
&s;entiments more improved; and if, at any
time, his greatne&s;s oppre&s;&s;es our thoughts,
<PB N="86" REF="93">
his moral perfections always afford us re|lief.
His almighty power, his infinite
wi&s;dom and &s;upreme goodne&s;s, are &s;ounds
familiar to our cars. In his immutability
we are le&s;s accu&s;tomed to con&s;ider him;
and yet it is this perfection which, perhaps,
more than any other di&s;tingui&s;hes the di|vine
nature from the human; gives com|plete
energy to all its other attributes, and
entitles it to the highe&s;t adoration. For,
hence are derived the regular order of na|ture
and the &s;tedfa&s;tne&s;s of the univer&s;e.
Hence flows the unchanging tenour of tho&s;e
laws which, from age to age, regulate the
conduct of mankind. Hence the uniform|ity
of that government, and the certainty
of tho&s;e promi&s;es, which are the ground of
our tru&s;t and &s;ecurity. Goodne&s;s could
produce no more than feeble and wavering
hopes, and power would command very
imperfect reverence, if we were left to
&s;u&s;pect that the plans which goodne&s;s had
framed might alter, or that the power of
carrying them into execution might de|crea&s;e.
The contemplation of God, there|fore,
<PB N="87" REF="94">
as unchangeable in his nature and in
all his perfections, mu&s;t undoubtedly be
fruitful both of in&s;truction and of con&s;ola|tion
to man. I &s;hall, fir&s;t, endeavour to
illu&s;trate in &s;ome degree the nature of the
divine immutability; and then make ap|plication
of it to our own conduct.</P>
<P><HI>EVERY good and every perfect gift
cometh down from the Father of Lights.</HI>
The title which in the text is given to the
Deity, carries an elegant allu&s;ion to the Sun,
the &s;ource of light, the mo&s;t univer&s;al be|nefactor
of nature, the mo&s;t regular and
con&s;tant of all the great bodies with which
we are acquainted in the univer&s;e. Yet
even with the Sun there are certain degrees
of <HI>variablene&s;s.</HI> He apparently ri&s;es and
&s;ets; he &s;eems to approach nearer to us in
&s;ummer, and to retire farther off in win|ter;
his influence is varied by the &s;ea&s;ons,
and his lu&s;tre is affected by the clouds.
Whereas with him who is the <HI>Father of
Lights,</HI> of who&s;e everla&s;ting brightne&s;s the
glory of the Sun is but a faint image,
<PB N="88" REF="95">
there is no <HI>&s;hadow of turning,</HI> not the mo&s;t
di&s;tant approach to change. In his being
or e&s;&s;ence it is plain that alteration can ne|ver
take place. For as his exi&s;tence is de|rived
from no prior cau&s;e, nor dependent
on any thing without him&s;elf, his nature
can be influenced by no power, can be
affected by no accident, can be impaired
by no time. From everla&s;ting to everla&s;t|ing,
he continues the &s;ame. Hence it is
&s;aid, the <HI>he only hath immortality;</HI> that is,
he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es it in a manner incommunicable
to all other beings. Eternity is de&s;cribed
as the <HI>high and holy place in which he
dwelleth;</HI> it is a habitation in which none
but the <HI>Father of Lights</HI> can enter. The
name which he taketh to him&s;elf is, <HI>I am.</HI>
Of other things, &s;ome have been and others
&s;hall be; but this is he <HI>which is, which
was, and which is to come.</HI> All time is his;
it is mea&s;ured out by him in limited por|tions
to the various orders of created beings;
but his own exi&s;tence fills equally every
point of duration; <HI>the fir&s;t and the la&s;t, the
beginning and the end, the &s;ame ye&s;terday, to|day,
and for ever.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="89" REF="96">
As in his e&s;&s;ence, &s;o in his attributes and
perfections, it is impo&s;&s;ible there can be any
change. To imperfect natures only it be|longs
to improve and to decay. Every al|teration
which they undergo in their abili|ties
or di&s;po&s;itions, flows either from inter|nal
defect, or from the influence if a &s;uperior
cau&s;e. But as no higher cau&s;e can bring
from without any acce&s;&s;ion to the divine
nature, &s;o within it&s;elf it contains no prin|ciple
of decay. For the &s;ame rea&s;on that
the &s;elf-exi&s;tent Being was from the begin|ning
powerful and wi&s;e, ju&s;t and good, he
mu&s;t continue unalterably &s;o for ever. Hence
with much propriety the divine perfections
are de&s;cribed in &s;cripture by allu&s;ions to
tho&s;e objects to which we a&s;cribe the mo&s;t
permanent &s;tability. <HI>His righteou&s;ne&s;s is
like the &s;trong mountains. His mercy is in
the heavens; and his faithfulne&s;s reacheth
unto the clouds.</HI> The&s;e perfections of the
divine nature differ widely from the human
virtues, which are their faint &s;hadows. The
ju&s;tice of men is at one time &s;evere, at an|other
time relenting; their goodne&s;s is &s;ome|times
<PB N="90" REF="97">
con&s;ined to a partial fondne&s;s for a
few, &s;ometimes runs out into a blind in|dulgence
towards all. But goodne&s;s and
ju&s;tice are in the Supreme Being calm and
&s;teady principles of action, which, enlight|ened
by perfect wi&s;dom, and never either
warped by partiality, or di&s;turbed by pa&s;&s;ion,
per&s;evere in one regular and con&s;tant tenor.
Among men they may &s;ometimes break forth
with tran&s;ient &s;plendour, like tho&s;e wan|dering
fires which illuminate for a little the
darkne&s;s of the night. But in God they
&s;hine with that uniform brightne&s;s, which
we can liken to nothing &s;o much as to the
untroubled, eternal lu&s;tre of the highe&s;t
heavens.</P>
<P>From this follows, what is chiefly mate|rial
for us to attend to, that in the cour&s;e
of his operations towards mankind, in his
coun&s;els and decrees, in his laws, his pro|mi&s;es,
and his threatenings, there is <HI>no va|riablene&s;s
nor &s;hadow of turning</HI> with the
Almighty. <HI>Known to him from the begin|ning
were all his works.</HI> In the divine idea
the whole &s;y&s;tem of nature exi&s;ted, long
<PB N="91" REF="98">
before the foundations of the earth were laid.
When he &s;aid, <HI>Let there be light,</HI> he only
realized the great plan which from everla&s;t|ing
he had formed in his own mind. Fore|&s;een
by him was every revolution which
the cour&s;e of ages was to produce. what|ever
the coun&s;els of men can effect was
comprehended in his decree. No new emer|gency
can ari&s;e to &s;urpri&s;e him. No agita|tions
of anger or of &s;orrow, of fear or of
hope, can &s;hake his mind or influence his
conduct. He re&s;ts in the eternal po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion
of that &s;upreme beatitude, which neither
the virtues nor the crimes of men can in the
lea&s;t affect. From a motive of overflowing
goodne&s;s, he reared up the univer&s;e. As
the eternal lover of righteou&s;ne&s;s, he rules it.
The whole &s;y&s;tem of his government is
fixed; his laws are irrevocable; and what
he once loveth, <HI>he loveth to the end.</HI> In
&s;cripture, indeed, he is &s;ometimes &s;aid to
<HI>be grieved,</HI> and <HI>to repent.</HI> But &s;uch expre&s;|&s;ions,
it is obvious, are employed from ac|commodation
to common conception; in
the &s;ame manner as when bodily organs are
<PB N="92" REF="99">
in other pa&s;&s;ages a&s;cribed to god. The
&s;cripture, as a rule of life addre&s;&s;ed to the
multitude, mu&s;t make u&s;e of the language
of men. The divine nature, repre&s;ented in
its native &s;ublimity, would have tran&s;cended
all human conception. When, upon the
reformation of &s;inners, God is &s;aid to <HI>repent
of the evil</HI> which he had threatened again&s;t
them, this intimates no more, than that he
&s;uits his di&s;pen&s;ations to the alterations which
take place in the characters of men. His
di&s;po&s;ition towards good and evil continues
the &s;ame, but varies in its application as its
objects vary; ju&s;t as the laws them&s;elves,
which are capable of no change of affection,
bring rewards or puni&s;hments at different
times to the &s;ame per&s;on, according as his
behaviour alters. Immutability is indeed &s;o
clo&s;ely connected with the notion of &s;upreme
perfection, that wherever any rational con|ceptions
of a Deity have taken place, this
attribute has been a&s;cribed to him. Rea&s;on
taught the wi&s;e and reflecting in every age
to believe, that, as what is eternal cannot
die, &s;o what is perfect can never vary, and
<PB N="93" REF="100">
that the great Governor of the univer&s;e
could be no other than an unchangeable
Being.</P>
<P>FROM the contemplation of this obvious,
but fundamental truth, let us proceed to
the practical improvement of it. Let us
con&s;ider what effect the &s;erious con&s;ideration
of it ought to produce on our mind and be|haviour.</P>
<P>It will be proper to begin this head of di&s;|cour&s;e
by removing an objection which the
doctrine I have illu&s;trated may appear to
form again&s;t religious &s;ervices, and in par|ticular
again&s;t the duty of prayer. To what
purpo&s;e, it may be urged, is homage ad|dre&s;&s;ed
to a Being who&s;e purpo&s;e is unal|terably
fixed; to whom <HI>our righteou&s;ne&s;s
extendeth not;</HI> whom by no arguments we
can per&s;uade, and by no &s;upplications we
can mollify? The objection would have
weight if our religious addre&s;&s;es were de|&s;igned
to work any alteration on God; ei|ther
by giving him information of what he
did not know; or by exciting affections
<PB N="94" REF="101">
which he did not po&s;&s;e&s;s; or by inducing
him to change mea&s;ures which he had pre|viou&s;ly
formed. But they are only crude
and imperfect notions of religion which can
&s;ugge&s;t &s;uch ideas. The change which our
devotions are intended to make is upon our|&s;elves,
not upon the Almighty. Their chief
efficacy is derived from the good di&s;po&s;itions
which they rai&s;e and cheri&s;h in the human
&s;oul. By pouring our pious &s;entiments and
de&s;ires before God, by adoring his perfec|tion
and confe&s;&s;ing our own unworthine&s;s,
by expre&s;&s;ing our dependence on his aid,
our gratitude for his pa&s;t favours, our &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion
to his pre&s;ent will, our tru&s;t in his
future mercy, we cultivate &s;uch affections
as &s;uit our place and &s;tation in the univer&s;e,
and are thereby prepared for becoming ob|jects
of the divine grace. Accordingly fre|quent
a&s;&s;urances are given us in Scripture,
that the prayers of &s;incere wor&s;hippers, pre|ferred
through the great Mediator, &s;hall be
productive of the happie&s;t effects. <HI>When
they a&s;k, they &s;hall receive; when they &s;eek,
they &s;hall find; when they knock, it &s;hall be
<PB N="95" REF="102">
opened to them.</HI> Prayer is appointed to be
the channel for conveying the divine grace
to mankind, becau&s;e the wi&s;dom of Heaven
&s;aw it to be one of the mo&s;t powerful means
of improving the human heart.</P>
<P>When religious homage is con&s;idered in
this light, as great in&s;trument of &s;piritual
and moral improvement, all the objections
which &s;ceptici&s;m can form from the divine
immutability, conclude with no more force
again&s;t prayer, than again&s;t every other
mean of improvement which rea&s;on has
&s;ugge&s;ted to man. If prayer be &s;uperfluous
becau&s;e God is unchangeable, we might
upon &s;imilar grounds conclude, that it is
needle&s;s to labour the earth, to nouri&s;h our
bodies, or to cultivate our minds, becau&s;e
the fertility of the ground, the continuance
of our life, and the degree of our under|&s;tanding,
depend upon an immutable So|vereign,
and were from all eternity fore|&s;een
by him. Such ab&s;urd conclu&s;ions rea|&s;on
has ever repudiated. To every plain
and &s;ound under&s;tanding it has clearly dic|tated,
that to explore the unknown purpo&s;es
<PB N="96" REF="103">
of Heaven belongs not to us; but that He
who decrees the end, certainly requires the
means; and that in the diligent employment
of all the means which can advance either
our temporal or &s;piritual felicity, the chief
exertions of human wi&s;dom and human
duty con&s;i&s;t. A&s;&s;uming it then for an un|doubted
principle, that religion is a rea&s;on|able
&s;ervice, and that, though with the <HI>Fa|ther
of Lights</HI> there be <HI>no variablene&s;s,</HI> the
homage of his creatures is neverthele&s;s for
the wi&s;e&s;t rea&s;ons required by him, I pro|ceed
to &s;hew what &s;entiments the contem|plation
of divine immutability &s;hould rai&s;e
in our minds, and what duties it &s;hould
chiefly enforce.</P>
<P>I. LET it excite us to admire and adore.
Filled with profound reverence, let us look
up to that Supreme Being who &s;its from
everla&s;ting on the throne of the univer&s;e;
moving all things, but remaining immove|able
him&s;elf; directing every revolution of
the creation, but affected by no revolutions
of events or of time. He beholds the heavens
<PB N="97" REF="104">
and the earth <HI>wax old as a garment, and
decay like a ve&s;ture.</HI> At their appointed pe|riods
he rai&s;es up, or he di&s;&s;olves worlds.
But amid&s;t all the convul&s;ions of changing
and peri&s;hing nature, his glory and felicity
remain unaltered.&mdash;The view of great and
&s;tupendous objects in the natural world
&s;trikes the mind with &s;olemn awe. What
veneration, then, ought to be in&s;pired by
the contemplation of an object &s;o &s;ublime
as the eternal and unchangeable ruler of the
univer&s;e! The compo&s;ure and &s;tillne&s;s of
thought introduced by &s;uch a meditation has
a powerful tendency both to purify and to
elevate the heart. It effaces, for a time,
tho&s;e trivial ideas, and extingui&s;hes tho&s;e
low pa&s;&s;ions which ari&s;e from the circle of
vain and pa&s;&s;ing objects around us. It opens
the mind to all the &s;entiments of devotion;
and accompanies devotion with that pro|found
reverence which guards it from every
improper exce&s;s. When we con&s;ider the
Supreme Being as employed in works of
love; when we think of his conde&s;cen&s;ion
to the human race in &s;ending his Son to
<PB N="98" REF="105">
dwell on the earth; encouraged by favours
and warmed by gratitude, we are &s;ometimes
in danger of pre&s;uming too much on his
goodne&s;s, and of indulging a certain fond|ne&s;s
of affection, which is un&s;uitable to our
humble and dependent &s;tate. It is nece&s;|&s;ary
that He &s;hould frequently appear to
our minds in all that maje&s;ty with which
the immutability of his nature clothes him;
in order that reverence may be combined
with love, and that a mixture of &s;acred awe
may cha&s;ten the rapturous effu&s;ions of warm
devotion. Servile fear, indeed, would cru&s;h
the &s;pirit of ingenuous and affectionate ho|mage.
But that reverence which &s;prings
from elevated conceptions of the divine na|ture,
has a happy effect in checking the
forwardne&s;s of imagination, re&s;training our
affections within due bounds, and compo|&s;ing
our thoughts at the &s;ame time that it
exalts them.</P>
<P>When, from the adoration of the un|changeable
perfection of the Almighty, we
return to the view of our own &s;tate, the fir&s;t
&s;entiment which ought naturally to ari&s;e, is
<PB N="99" REF="106">
that of &s;elf-aba&s;ement. We are to
be lifted up by any little di&s;tinctions which
we po&s;&s;e&s;s; and to fancy our&s;elves great,
only becau&s;e there are others whom we con|&s;ider
as le&s;s. But what is man with all his
advantages and boa&s;ted powers before the
eternal <HI>Father of Lights?</HI> With God there
is no variablene&s;s; with man there is no
&s;tability. Virtue and vice divide the em|pire
of his mind; and wi&s;dom and &s;olly
alternately rule him. Hence he is change|able
in his de&s;igns, &s;ickle in his friend&s;hips,
fluctuating in his whole character. His
life is a &s;eries of contradictions. He is one
thing to-day, and another to-morrow;
&s;ometimes obliged by experience to alter his
purpo&s;e, and often led to change it through
levity. Variable and unequal him&s;elf, he
is &s;urrounded with fleeting objects. He is
placed as in the mid&s;t of a torrent, where all
things are rolling by, and nothing keeps its
place. He has hardly time to contemplate
this &s;cene of vici&s;&s;itude, before he too is
&s;wept away.&mdash;Thus circum&s;tanced in him|&s;elf,
and in all the objects with which he is
<PB N="100" REF="107">
connected, let him be admoni&s;hed to be
humble and mode&s;t. Let the contempla|tion
of the unchanging glory of his Creator
in&s;pire him with &s;entiments of due &s;ubmi&s;|&s;ion.
Let it teach him to know his proper
place; and check that vanity which is &s;o
ready to betray him into guilt.</P>
<P>Let the &s;ame meditation affect him with
a deep &s;en&s;e of what he owes to the good|ne&s;s
of the Deity. His goodne&s;s never ap|pears
in &s;o &s;triking a light, as when viewed
in connexion with his greatne&s;s. The de|&s;cription
which is given of him in the text
calls, in this view, for our particular atten|tion.
It pre&s;ents to us the mo&s;t amiable
union of conde&s;cen&s;ion with maje&s;ty, of the
moral with the natural perfections of God,
which can po&s;&s;ibly be exhibited to the ima|gination
of man. <HI>From the Father of Lights,
with whom there is no variablene&s;s, neither
&s;hadow of turning, cometh down every good
and perfect gift.</HI> The mo&s;t independent of
all Beings is repre&s;ented as the mo&s;t benefi|cent.
He who is eternal and immutable,
exalted above all, and incapable of receiving
<PB N="101" REF="108">
returns from any, is the liberal and un|wearied
Giver of every thing that is good.
&mdash;Let &s;uch views of the divine nature not
only call forth gratitude and prai&s;e, but
prompt us to imitate what we adore. Let
them &s;hew us that benevolence is divine;
that to &s;toop from our fancied grandeur in
order to a&s;&s;i&s;t and relieve one another, is &s;o
far from being any degradation of character,
that it is our true&s;t honour, and our neare&s;t
re&s;emblance to <HI>the Father of Lights.</HI></P>
<P>II. LET the con&s;ideration of the divine
immutability convince us, that the method
of attaining the favour of Heaven is one
and invariable. Were the Almighty a ca|pricious
and incon&s;tant Being, like man,
we &s;hould be at a lo&s;s what tenour of con|duct
to hold. In order to conciliate his
grace, we might think of applying &s;ome|times
to one &s;uppo&s;ed principle of his incli|nation,
&s;ometimes to another; and bewil|dered
amid&s;t various attempts, would be
overwhelmed with di&s;may. The guilty
would e&s;&s;ay to flatter him. The timid,
<PB N="102" REF="109">
&s;ometimes by au&s;tere mortifications, &s;ome|times
by co&s;tly gifts, &s;ometimes by ob&s;e|quious
rites, would try to appea&s;e him.
Hence, in fact, have ari&s;en all the corrup|tions
of religious wor&s;hip among men;
from their forming the divine character
upon their own, and a&s;cribing to the Sove|reign
of the Univer&s;e the mutability of hu|man
pa&s;&s;ions. God is repre&s;ented by the
p&s;almi&s;t David as &s;aying to the wicked, <HI>Thou
thoughte&s;t</HI> that I was altogether &s;uch an one
as thy&s;elf<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">P&s;alm l. 21.</NOTE>. This continues to be the de|&s;cription
of all the &s;uper&s;titious and enthu|&s;ia&s;tic
&s;ects which, &s;ince the days of David,
have &s;prung up in the world.</P>
<P>It is our peculiar happine&s;s under the go|&s;pel
to have God revealed to us in his ge|nuine
character, as <HI>without variablene&s;s or
&s;hadow of turning.</HI> We know that at no
time there is any change, either in his af|fections,
or in the plan of his admini&s;tra|tion.
One light always &s;hines upon us
from above. One clear and direct path is
always pointed out to man. The Supreme
<PB N="103" REF="110">
Being is, and was, and ever will be, the
&s;upporter of order and virtue; <HI>the righteous
Lord loving righteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI> The external
forms of religion may vary; but under all
di&s;pen&s;ations which proceed from God, its
&s;ub&s;tance is the &s;ame. It tends continually
to one point, the purification of man's heart
and life. This was the object of the ori|ginal
law of nature. This was the &s;cope of
the Mo&s;aic in&s;titution amid&s;t all its &s;acrifices
and rites; and this is unque&s;tionably the
end of the go&s;pel. So invariably con&s;tant
is God to this purpo&s;e, that the di&s;pen&s;ation
of mercy in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, which admits of
the vicarious atonement and righteou&s;ne&s;s
of a Redeemer, makes no change in our
obligation to fulfil the duties of a good life.
The Redeemer him&s;elf hath taught us, that
to the end of time the moral law continues
in its full force; and that <HI>till heaven and
earth pa&s;s away, one jot or tittle &s;hall in no
wi&s;e pa&s;s from it</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Matth. v. 18.</NOTE>. <HI>This is the only in&s;titu|tion
known to men,</HI> who&s;e authority is un|changing
and con&s;tant. Human laws ri&s;e
<PB N="104" REF="111">
and fall with the empires that gave them
birth. Sy&s;tems of philo&s;ophy vary with the
progre&s;s of knowledge and light. Manners,
&s;entiments, and opinions, alter with the
cour&s;e of time. But throughout all ages,
and amid&s;t all revolutions, the rule of mo|ral
and religious conduct is the &s;ame. It
partakes of that immutability of the divine
nature, on which it is founded. Such as
it was delivered to the fir&s;t wor&s;hippers of
God, it continues to be, at this day, to us;
and &s;uch it &s;hall remain to our po&s;terity for
ever.</P>
<P>III. LET the contemplation of this per|fection
of the divine nature teach us to
imitate, as far as our frailty will permit,
that con&s;tancy and &s;tedfa&s;tne&s;s which we
adore. All the moral attributes of the Su|preme
Being, are &s;tandards of character
towards which we ought to a&s;pire. But
as in all the&s;e perfections there are proper|ties
peculiar to the divine nature, our endea|vours
to re&s;emble them are laid under great
re&s;trictions by the di&s;&s;imilarity between our
<PB N="105" REF="112">
nature and the divine. With re&s;pect to
that attribute which we now con&s;ider, the
circum&s;tances are evident which preclude
improper imitation. To man it is fre|quently
nece&s;&s;ary to correct his errours, and
to change his conduct. An attempt, there|fore,
to continue wholly invariable would,
in our &s;ituation, be no other than impru|dent
and criminal ob&s;tinacy. But withal,
the immutable rectitude of the Deity &s;hould
lead us to a&s;pire after fixedne&s;s of principle
and uniformity in conduct, as the glory of
the rational nature. Impre&s;&s;ed with the
&s;en&s;e of that &s;upreme excellence which
re&s;ults from unchanging goodne&s;s, faith|fulne&s;s
and truth, let us become a&s;hamed
of that levity which degrades the human
character. Let us <HI>ponder our paths,</HI> act
upon a well-regulated plan, and remain
con&s;i&s;tent with our&s;elves. Contemplating
the glory of the Father of Lights, let us
aim at being transformed, in &s;ome degree,
<HI>into the &s;ame image from glory to glory.</HI> Fi|nally,</P>
<P><PB N="106" REF="113">
IV. LET the divine immutability become
the ground of confidence and tru&s;t to good
men, amid&s;t all the revolutions of this un|certain
world. This is one of the chief im|provements
to be made of the &s;ubject, and
therefore requires full illu&s;tration. There
are three lights in which we may view the
benefit redounding to us from that attribute
of God which we now con&s;ider. It a&s;&s;ures
us of the con&s;tancy of nature; of the regu|lar
admini&s;tration of Providence; of the
certain accompli&s;hment of all the divine
promi&s;es.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, it gives us ground to depend on the
con&s;tant and uniform cour&s;e of nature. On
the unchangeablene&s;s of God re&s;ts the &s;ta|bility
of the univer&s;e. What we call the
laws of nature are no other than the decrees
of the Supreme Being. It is becau&s;e He is
<HI>without variablene&s;s or &s;hadow of turning</HI>
that tho&s;e laws have continued the &s;ame
&s;ance the beginning of the world; that the
Sun &s;o con&s;tantly ob&s;erves his time of ri&s;ing
and going down; that the &s;ea&s;ons annually
return; the tides periodically ebb and flow;
<PB N="107" REF="114">
the earth yields its fruits at &s;tated intervals;
and the human body and mental powers
advance to maturity by a regular progre&s;s.
In all tho&s;e motions and operations which
are ince&s;&s;antly going on throughout nature,
there is no &s;top nor interruption; no change
nor innovation; no deflection from their
main &s;cope. The &s;ame powerful and &s;teady
hand which pave the fir&s;t impul&s;e to the
powers of nature, re&s;trains them from ever
exceeding their pre&s;cribed line. Hence
ari&s;es the chief comfort of our pre&s;ent life.
We find our&s;elves in a regular and orderly
world. We look forward to a known &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion
of events. We are enabled to form
plans of action. From the cau&s;e we calcu|late
the effect; and from the pa&s;t, we rea|&s;on
with confidence concerning the future.</P>
<P>Accu&s;tomed from our infancy to this con|&s;tancy
in nature, we are hardly &s;en&s;ible of
the ble&s;&s;ing. Familiarity has the &s;ame ef|fect
here, as in many other enjoyments, to
efface gratitude. But let us, for a moment,
take an oppo&s;ite view of things. Let us
&s;uppo&s;e, that we had any cau&s;e to dread
<PB N="108" REF="115">
capriciou&s;ne&s;s or change in the power who
rules the cour&s;e or nature; any ground to
&s;u&s;pect that, but for one day, the Sun
might not ri&s;e, nor the current of the wa|ters
hold their u&s;ual cour&s;e, nor the laws of
motion and vegetation proceed as we have
been accu&s;tomed to behold them. What
di&s;may would in&s;tantly fill all hearts!
what horror would &s;eem to over&s;pread the
whole face of Nature! What part could we
act, or whithe could we run, in the mid&s;t
of convul&s;ions which overturned all the
mea&s;ures we had formed for happine&s;s, or
for &s;afety? The pre&s;ent adobe of man
would then become, as Job de&s;cribes the
region of the grave, <HI>a land of darkne&s;s, as
darkne&s;s it&s;elf, and the &s;hadow of death;
without any order; and where the light is as
darkne&s;s</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Job x. 22.</NOTE>. With what joy ought we then
to recognize an unvarying and &s;tedfa&s;t ruler,
under who&s;e dominion we have no &s;uch
di&s;a&s;ters to dread; but can depend on the
cour&s;e of Nature continuing to proceed as
<PB N="109" REF="116">
it has ever gone on, until the period &s;hall
arrive of its final di&s;&s;olution!</P>
<P>BUT though the great laws of Nature be
con&s;tant like their Author, yet in the
affairs of men there is much variety and
change. All that regards our pre&s;ent po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ions
and enjoyments was, for wi&s;e rea|&s;ons,
left, in a great mea&s;ure, uncertain;
and from this uncertainty ari&s;es the di&s;ter&s;s
of human life. Sen&s;ible of the changes to
which we lie open, we look round with
anxious eyes, and eagerly gra&s;p at every
object which appears to promi&s;e us &s;ecu|rity.
But in vain is the whole circle of
human things explored with this view.
There is nothing on earth &s;o &s;table as to
a&s;&s;ure us of undi&s;turbed re&s;t, nor &s;o power|ful
as to afford us con&s;tant protection.
Time, death, and change, triumph over all
the labours of men. What we build up,
they ince&s;&s;antly de&s;troy. The public con|dition
of nations, and the private fortunes of
individuals, are alike &s;ubject to rever&s;e.
Life never retains long the &s;ame form. Its
<PB N="110" REF="117">
whole &s;cenery is continually &s;hifting around
us.&mdash;Amid&s;t tho&s;e endle&s;s vici&s;&s;itudes,
what can give any firm con&s;olation, any
&s;atisfying re&s;t to the heart, except the domi|nion
of a wi&s;e and righteous &s;overeign,
<HI>with whom there is no variablene&s;s nor &s;ha|dow
of turning?</HI> Though all things change,
and we our&s;elves be involved in the general
mutability, yet as long as there is fixed and
permanent goodne&s;s at the head of the uni|ver&s;e
we are a&s;&s;ured that the great intere&s;ts
of all good men &s;hall be &s;afe. That <HI>river</HI>
perpetually flows, <HI>the &s;treams whereof make
glad the city of God.</HI> We know that the
Supreme Being loved righteou&s;ne&s;s from
the beginning of days, and that he will
continue to love it to the la&s;t. Under his
government none of tho&s;e revolutions hap|pen
which have place among the kingdoms
of the earth; where princes die and new
&s;overeigns a&s;cend the throne; new mini&s;|ters
and new coun&s;els &s;ucceed; the whole
face of affairs is changed; and former plans
fall into oblivion. But <HI>the throne of the Lord
is e&s;tabli&s;hed for ever; and the thoughts of his
<PB N="111" REF="118">
heart endure to all generations.</HI> We &s;erve
the &s;ame God whom our fathers wor&s;hip|ped
and whom our po&s;terity &s;hall adore.
His unchanging dominion comprehends all
events and all ages; e&s;tabli&s;hes a connect|ing
principle which holds together the pa&s;t,
the pre&s;ent, and the future; gives &s;tability
to things which in them&s;elves are fluctuat|ing,
and extracts order from tho&s;e which
appear mo&s;t confu&s;ed. Well may <HI>the earth
rejoice, and the multitude of i&s;les be gald,</HI>
becau&s;e there reigneth over the univer&s;e &s;uch
an immutable Lord.</P>
<P>Were you to unhinge this great article
of faith; were you either to <HI>&s;ay with the
fool,</HI> that there is <HI>no God,</HI> or to &s;uppo&s;e with
the &s;uper&s;titious, that the God who rules
is variable and capricious; you would in|deed
<HI>lay the axe to the root of the tree,</HI> and
cut down, with one blow, the hope and
&s;ecurity of mankind. For you would then
leave nothing in the whole compa&s;s of na|ture,
but a round of ca&s;ual and tran&s;itory
being; no foundation of tru&s;t, no protec|tion
to the righteous, no &s;tedfa&s;t principle
<PB N="112" REF="119">
to uphold and to regulate the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of
exi&s;tence. In&s;tead of that magnificent &s;pec|tacle
which the world now exhibits, when
beheld in connexion with the divine go|vernment,
it would then only pre&s;ent to
view, a multitude of &s;hort-lived creatures
&s;pringing out of the du&s;t, wandering on
the face of the earth without guide or pro|tector,
&s;truggling for a few years again&s;t
the torrent of uncertainty and change;
and then &s;inking into utter oblivion, and
vani&s;hing like vi&s;ions of the night. My&s;|terious
ob&s;curity would involve the begin|ning
of things; di&s;order would mark their
progre&s;s; and the blackne&s;s of darkne&s;s
would cover their final re&s;ult. Whereas,
when Faith enables us to di&s;cover an uni|ver&s;al
Sovereign, who&s;e power never fails,
and who&s;e wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s never
change, the pro&s;pect clears up on every
&s;ide. A ray from the great &s;ource of light
&s;eems to illuminate the whole creation.
Good men di&s;cover a parent and a friend.
They attain a fortre&s;s in every danger; a
refuge amid&s;t all &s;torms, <HI>a dwelling-place
<PB N="113" REF="120">
in all generations.</HI> They are no longer <HI>afraid
of evil tidings. Their heart is fixed, tru&s;t|ing
in the Lord.</HI></P>
<P>THOUGH the&s;e rea&s;onings from the un|changing
tenour of Divine government
cannot but afford much comfort to good
men, their &s;atisfaction, however, becomes
&s;till more complete, when they con&s;ider
the explicit promi&s;es which are given them
in the word of God. The immutability of
the divine purpo&s;e a&s;&s;ures them mo&s;t per|fectly
of tho&s;e promi&s;es being fulfilled in
due time, how adver&s;e &s;oever circum&s;tances
may at pre&s;ent appear to their accompli&s;h|ment.
<HI>The &s;trength of I&s;rael is not a man
that he &s;hould lie, nor the &s;on of man that he
&s;hould repent. Hath he &s;aid it, and &s;hall he
not do it? Hath he &s;poken, and &s;hall he not
make it good?</HI> Men have the command
only of the pre&s;ent time. When that is
&s;uffered to pa&s;s, changes may befal, either
in their own &s;tate, or in the &s;ituation of
things around them, which &s;hall defeat their
be&s;t intentions in our behalf, and render all
<PB N="114" REF="121">
their promi&s;es fruitle&s;s. Hence, even &s;et|ting
a&s;ide the danger of human incon&s;tancy,
the confidence which we can repo&s;e on any

Man, in his highe&s;t glory, is but a reed

bidding adieu to life, with all its changeful

<P>SUCH are the benefits which good men
may derive from meditation on God as
<PB N="116" REF="123">
<HI>without variablene&s;s or &s;hadow of turning.</HI>
It in&s;pires them with &s;entiments of devout,
humble, and grateful adoration. It points
out to them the unvarying tenour of con|duct
which they ought to hold; checks their
&s;icklene&s;s and incon&s;tancy; and amid&s;t all
di&s;tre&s;&s;es and fears affords them comfort.
The immutability of God is the &s;ure&s;t ba&s;is
on which their hopes can be built. It is
indeed the pillar on which the whole uni|ver&s;e
re&s;ts.&mdash;On &s;uch &s;erious and &s;olemn

order to correct that folly and levity which
are &s;o apt to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the human
heart. And if our minds be overawed, and
even depre&s;&s;ed, with &s;o high a view of the
divine nature, let them be relieved by the
reflection, that to this unchangeable God
we are permitted to look up through a gra|cious

<P>WHEN we compare the coun&s;els of
Providence with the plans of men,<NOTE PLACE="marg">SERM. V.</NOTE>
we find a like difference obtain as in the
works of nature compared with tho&s;e of art.
The works of art may, at fir&s;t view, appear
the mo&s;t fini&s;hed and beautiful; but when
<PB N="118" REF="125">
the eye is a&s;&s;i&s;ted to pry into their contexture,
the nice&s;t workman&s;hip is di&s;cerned to be
rough and blemi&s;hed. Whereas the works
of nature gain by the mo&s;t accurate exami|nation;
and tho&s;e which on a &s;uperficial
&s;urvey appeared defective or rude, the more
intimately they are in&s;pected, di&s;cover the
more exact con&s;truction and con&s;ummate
beauty. In the &s;ame manner the &s;y&s;tems
of worldly policy, though at fir&s;t they &s;eem
plau&s;ible and profound, &s;oon betray in their
progre&s;s the narrowne&s;s of the human un|der&s;tanding;
while tho&s;e di&s;pen&s;ations of
Providence which appeared to furni&s;h ob|jections
either again&s;t the goodne&s;s or the
wi&s;dom of Heaven, have, upon a more ex|ten&s;ive
view of their con&s;equences, fre|quently
afforded the mo&s;t &s;triking proofs of
both.</P>
<P><HI>God manife&s;ted in the fle&s;h</HI> was <HI>to the Jews
a &s;tumbling-block, and to the Greeks, fooli&s;h|ne&s;s.</HI>
It contradicted every prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion
which their confined ideas of religion and
philo&s;ophy led them to entertain. If a &s;u|periour
Being was to interpo&s;e for the re&s;to|ration
<PB N="119" REF="126">
of a degenerative world, they concluded
that he would certainly appear in cele&s;tial
maje&s;ty. But <HI>the thoughts of God are not
as the thoughts of men.</HI> The divine wi&s;dom
&s;aw it to be fit that the Saviour of mankind
&s;hould <HI>in all things be made like unto tho&s;e</HI>
whom he came to &s;ave. By living as a man
among men, he di&s;pen&s;ed in&s;truction in the
mo&s;t winning manner. He added to in|&s;truction
the grace and the force of his own
example. He accommodated that example
to the mo&s;t trying and difficult &s;ituations of
human life; and by &s;uffering a painful
death, he both taught men how to &s;uffer
and die, and in that nature which had of|fended
he offered a &s;olemn expiation to God
for human guilt.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the&s;e ends, &s;o worthy of God,
which were accompli&s;hed by the incarna|tion
of Chri&s;t, another, of high importance,
is &s;ugge&s;ted in the text. Human life is to
good men, as well as to others, a &s;tate of
&s;uffering and di&s;tre&s;s. To &s;upply them
with proper con&s;olation and encouragement
during &s;uch a &s;tate, was one great purpo&s;e
<PB N="120" REF="127">
of the undertaking of Chri&s;t. With this
view he a&s;&s;umed the office of their high
prie&s;t, or mediator with God; and the en|couragement
which this office affords them,
will be proportioned to their a&s;&s;ured belief,
fir&s;t of his power, and next of his com|pa&s;&s;ion.
His power is &s;et forth in the ver&s;e
preceding the text, and the proper argu|ment
is founded upon it. <HI>Seeing that we
have a great high prie&s;t who is pa&s;&s;ed into
the heavens, Je&s;us the Son of God, let us hold
fa&s;t our profe&s;&s;ion.</HI> But though it be en|couraging
to know that our high prie&s;t
is <HI>the Son of God,</HI> and that he <HI>is pa&s;&s;ed into
the heavens,</HI> yet the&s;e facts alone are not
&s;ufficient to render him the full object of
our confidence. For, as the Apo&s;tle after|wards
ob&s;erves, it belongs to the character
of a high prie&s;t <HI>to be taken from among men,
that he may have compa&s;&s;ion on the ignorant,
and them that are out of the way, &s;eeing that
he him&s;elf is compa&s;&s;ed with infirmity.</HI> In
order then to &s;atisfy us of our high prie&s;t's
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing al&s;o the qualifications of mercy
and compa&s;&s;ion, we are told that he is <HI>touch|ed
<PB N="121" REF="128">
with the feeling of our infirmities, and
was in all points tempted like as we are.</HI>
The force of this con&s;ideration I purpo&s;e
now to illu&s;trate. I &s;hall fir&s;t explain the
facts which are &s;tated in the text, and then
&s;how how from the&s;e our Saviour's com|pa&s;&s;ion
is to be inferred, and in what man|ner
it may be accommodated to the con&s;o|lation
and hope of good men amid&s;t various
exigencies of life.</P>
<P>THE a&s;&s;ertion in the text of Chri&s;t's be|ing
<HI>touched with the feeling of our infirmities,</HI>
plainly implies that he had full experience
both of the external di&s;ter&s;&s;es, and of the
internal &s;orrows of human nature. A&s;&s;um|ing
a body &s;uch as ours, he &s;ubjected him|&s;elf
to all the natural con&s;equences of cor|poreal
frailty. He did not chu&s;e for him|&s;elf
an ea&s;y and opulent condition, in order
to glide through the world with the lea&s;t
mole&s;tation. He did not &s;uit his mi&s;&s;ion to
the upper ranks of mankind chiefly, by
a&s;&s;imilating his &s;tate to theirs. But, born
in meanne&s;s, and bred up to labour, he
<PB N="122" REF="129">
&s;ubmitted to the inconveniencies of that
poor and toil&s;ome life which falls to the
&s;hare of the mo&s;t numerous part of the hu|man
race. Whatever is &s;evere in the di&s;|regard
of relations or the ingratitude of
friends, in the &s;corn of the proud or the
in&s;ults of the mean, in the virulence of
reproach or the &s;harpne&s;s of pain, was un|dergone
by Chri&s;t. Though his life was
&s;hort, he familiarized him&s;elf in it with a
wide compa&s;s of human woe; and there is
almo&s;t no di&s;tre&s;sful &s;ituation to which we
can be reduced, but what he has experi|enced
before us. There is not the lea&s;t
rea&s;on to imagine that the eminence of his
nature rai&s;ed him above the &s;en&s;ations of
trouble and grief. Had this been the ca&s;e,
he would have been a &s;ufferer in appear|ance
only, not in reality; there would have
been no merit in his patience, or in the re|&s;ignation
which he expre&s;&s;ed. On the con|trary,
it appears from many circum&s;tances,
that the &s;en&s;ibility of his nature was tender
and exqui&s;ite. He affected none of that
hard indifference in which &s;ome ancient
<PB N="123" REF="130">
philo&s;ophers vainly gloried. He felt as a
man, and he &s;ympathized with feelings
of others. On different occa&s;ions we are
informed that he was <HI>troubled in &s;pirit,</HI> that
<HI>he groaned,</HI> and that <HI>he wept.</HI> The relation
of his agony in the garden of Geth&s;emane
exhibits a &s;triking picture of the &s;en&s;ations
of innocent nature oppre&s;&s;ed with angui&s;h.
It di&s;covers all the conflict between the
dread of &s;uffering on the one hand, and the
&s;en&s;e of duty on the other; the man &s;trug|gling
for a while with human weakne&s;s,
and in the end recollected in virtue, and
ri&s;ing &s;uperiour to the objects of di&s;may
which were then in his view. <HI>Father! if
it be po&s;&s;ible, let this cup pa&s;s from me. Ne|verthele&s;s,
not as I will, but as thou wilt.
They will be done.</HI> Thus was our Saviour
<HI>touched with the feeling of our infirmities.</HI>
He was <HI>a man of &s;orrows, and acquainted
with grief.</HI></P>
<P>It is added in the text, that he was <HI>in all
points tempted like as we are.</HI> To be tempt|ed
is, in the language of Scripture, to un|dergo
&s;uch trials of virtue as are accompa|nied
<PB N="124" REF="131">
with difficulty and conflict. Though
our Lord was not liable to any temptations
from depravity of nature, yet he was per|petually
expo&s;ed to &s;uch as ari&s;e from &s;itua|tions
the mo&s;t adver&s;e to virtue. His whole
life was in this re&s;pect a cour&s;e of tempta|tion;
that is, a &s;evere trial of his con&s;tancy
by every di&s;couragement. He &s;uffered
repeated provocations both from friends
and foes. His endeavours to do good were
requited with the mo&s;t ob&s;tinate and per|ver&s;e
oppo&s;ition. Sometimes by the &s;olici|tations
of ignorant multitudes he was tempt|ed
to accept the proffers of worldly greatne&s;s.
Oftener, by the in&s;ults of multitudes, more
blind and brutal, he was tempted to de&s;ert
an office which expo&s;ed him to &s;o much
mi&s;ery. Together with the world, the
powers of darkne&s;s al&s;o combined their
efforts again&s;t him. We are informed that
he was <HI>led into the wilderne&s;s,</HI> and amid&s;t
the horrours of a wild and dreary &s;olitude,
was <HI>tempted of the devil.</HI> The great adver|&s;ary
of mankind &s;eems to have been per|mitted
to exert unu&s;ual proofs of his power
<PB N="125" REF="132">
and malice, on purpo&s;e that the trial of
our Saviour's con&s;tancy might be more
complete, and his victory over him more
illu&s;trious and di&s;tingui&s;hed</P>
<P>From all the&s;e circum&s;tances, the conclu|&s;ion
is obvious, that our Lord knows from
per&s;onal experience, all the di&s;couragements
and temptations which virtue can &s;uffer.
Though the participated not of the corrup|tion,
yet he felt the weakne&s;s of human
nature. He felt the &s;trength of pa&s;&s;ion.
He is no &s;tranger to the di&s;turbance and
commotion which either the attacks of the
world, or the powers of darkne&s;s, are able
to rai&s;e within the brea&s;t of man. One re|markable
difference, indeed, takes place
between our temptations and tho&s;e of Chri&s;t.
Though he was <HI>tempted like as we are, yet
it was without &s;in.</HI> Though the conflict
was the &s;ame, the i&s;&s;ue was different. We
are often foiled; He always overcame. But
his di&s;conformity to us in this re&s;pect is far
from weakening the &s;trength of our pre&s;ent
argument. For &s;in contracts and hardens
the heart. Every degree of guilt incurred
<PB N="126" REF="133">
by yielding to temptation tends to deba&s;e
the mind, and to weaken the generous and
benevolent principles in human nature. If
from our Lord's being <HI>tempted like as we are,</HI>
we have any ground to expect his &s;ympa|thy,
from his being tempted, <HI>yet without
&s;in,</HI> we are entitled to hope that his &s;ym|pathy,
unallayed and perfect, will operate
with more complete energy.</P>
<P>FROM this view of the facts which are
&s;tated in the text, I proceed to &s;how how
ju&s;tly we may infer our Saviour's compa&s;|&s;ion,
and in what manner it is to be ac|commodated
to the con&s;olation of good men
amid&s;t various exigences of life.</P>
<P>It has been the univer&s;al opinion of man|kind,
that per&s;onal experience of &s;uffering
humanizes the heart. In the &s;chool of af|fliction,
compa&s;&s;ion is always &s;uppo&s;ed to
be mo&s;t thoroughly learned: and hence in
the laws of Mo&s;es, when the I&s;raelites are
commanded not to oppre&s;s the &s;tranger, this
rea&s;on is given, <HI>for ye know the heart of a
&s;tranger, &s;eeing ye were &s;trangers your&s;elves
<PB N="127" REF="134">
in the land of Egypt.</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Exod. xxiii. 9.</NOTE> The di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, ac|cordingly,
file for con&s;olation the tho&s;e who
have been their companions in woe. They
decline the pro&s;perous, and look up to
them with a &s;u&s;picious eye. They con&s;i|der
them as ignorant of their feelings, and
therefore regardle&s;s of their complaints.
Amid&s;t the manifold &s;orrows of life, then,
how &s;oothing is the thought that our great
interce&s;&s;or with God was a fellow-&s;ufferer
with our&s;elves, while he pa&s;&s;ed through
this valley of tears!</P>
<P>But was it nece&s;&s;ary for Chri&s;t, it may
be &s;aid, to a&s;&s;ume our nature in order to
acquire the knowledge of its infirmity and
di&s;tre&s;s? As a divine per&s;on, was he not
perfectly acquainted with our frame before
he de&s;cended to the earth? Did the &s;tand
in need of being prompted to compa&s;&s;ion
by the experience of our &s;orrows? Could
his experimental knowledge of human weak|ne&s;s
increa&s;e the benevolence of a nature
which before was perfect?&mdash;No: he &s;ub|mitted
<PB N="128" REF="135">
to be <HI>touched with the feeling of our
infirmities, and to be tempted like as we are;</HI>
not in order to become acquainted with
our nature, but to &s;atisfy us that he knew
it perfectly; not in order to acquire any
new degree of goodne&s;s, but to give us the
firmer con&s;idence in the goodne&s;s which he
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, and to convey the &s;en&s;e of it to
our hearts with greater force and effect.</P>
<P>Di&s;tru&s;t is a weakne&s;s peculiarly incident
to the mi&s;erable. They are apt to reject
hope, to indulge fear, and to tinge with the
dark colour of their own minds every ob|ject
which is offered for their encourage|ment.
The repre&s;entations given us of the
Deity in Scripture afford undoubtedly much
ground for tru&s;t in his goodne&s;s. But the
perfection of an Almighty Being, who
dwelleth in the &s;ecret place of eternity,
<HI>whom no man hath &s;een or can &s;ee,</HI> is over|whelming
to a timid apprehen&s;ion. The
goodne&s;s which it promi&s;es is a new and
unknown form of goodne&s;s. Whatever
proceeds from a nature &s;o far &s;uperiour to
our own, is beheld with a degree of awe
<PB N="129" REF="136">
which is ready to overpower hope. Upon
this account, under the Old Te&s;tament di&s;|pen&s;ation,
the Supreme Being is often de|&s;cribed
with the attributes of a man, in order
to give a &s;hade and &s;oftening to his great|ne&s;s,
and to accommodate his goodne&s;s
more to our capacity. The relentings of a
friend, the pity of a parent, and the &s;ighs
of a mourner, are a&s;cribed to the Almighty.
But we ea&s;ily perceive &s;uch attributes to be
no more than figures and allu&s;ions. The
comfort which they afford is not definite
nor preci&s;e. They leave the mind under
an anxious uncertainty left it err in its in|terpretation
of tho&s;e allegories of mercy.
In the per&s;on of Je&s;us Chri&s;t the object of
our tru&s;t is brought nearer to our&s;elves;
and of cour&s;e adapted more effectually to
our encouragement. Tho&s;e well-known
tender affections, which are only figura|tively
a&s;cribed to the Divinity, are in our
great Mediator thoroughly realized. His
goodne&s;s is the goodne&s;s of human nature
exalted and rendered perfect. It is that
&s;pecies of goodne&s;s with which, of all others,
<PB N="130" REF="137">
we are be&s;t acquainted, compa&s;&s;ion to the
unhappy; and compa&s;&s;ion cultivated by
that di&s;cipline which we know to be the
mo&s;t powerful, the experience of &s;orrows.</P>
<P>For &s;uch rea&s;ons as the&s;e, <HI>becau&s;e the chil|dren
are partakers of fle&s;h and blood, Chri&s;t
him&s;elf likewi&s;e took part of the &s;ame. In all
things it behoved him to be made like unto his
brethren, that he might be a merciful,</HI> as well
as <HI>a faithful high prie&s;t.</HI> When we con&s;ider
his a&s;&s;umption of our nature in this light,
what a mild and amiable a&s;pect does it give
to the government of heaven! What atten|tive
&s;olicitude of goodne&s;s is &s;hewn in car|rying
on the di&s;pen&s;ation of our redemption
upon a plan &s;o perfectly calculated to bani&s;h
all di&s;tru&s;t, and to revive the mo&s;t timid
and dejected heart! How naturally does
that inference follow which the Apo&s;tle
makes in the ver&s;e immediately &s;ucceeding
the text; <HI>let us therefore come boldly to the
throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy,
and find grace to help in time of need!</HI> More
particularly, in con&s;equence of the doctrine
which I have illu&s;trated, we are taught to
hope,</P>
<P><PB N="131" REF="138">
I. THAT under all our infirmities and
errors, regard will be had to human im|perfection;
that a merciful di&s;tinction will
be made between what is weak and what is
wilfully criminal in our conduct; and that
&s;uch mea&s;ures of obedience only will be ex|acted
as are proportioned to our circum|&s;tances
and powers. What can more en|courage
our religious &s;ervices, than to be
a&s;&s;ured that the God whom we wor&s;hip
<HI>knows our frame, and remembers we are du&s;t;</HI>
and that the Mediator, through whom we
wor&s;hip him, <HI>is touched with the feeling of
our infirmities?</HI> The mo&s;t virtuous are the
mo&s;t apt to be dejected with the &s;en&s;e of
their frailty. While vain and &s;uperficial
men are ea&s;ily flattered with favourable
views of them&s;elves, and fond hopes of
divine acceptance, the &s;lighte&s;t apprehen|&s;ion
of guilt is ready to alarm the humble
and delicate mind; ju&s;t as on coar&s;e bodies
and impre&s;&s;ion is not ea&s;ily made, while
tho&s;e of finer contexture are &s;oon hurt; and
as on an exqui&s;ite poli&s;h the lea&s;t &s;peek is
vi&s;ible. But though religion promotes great
<PB N="132" REF="139">
&s;en&s;ibility to all feelings of a moral nature,
yet it gives no countenance to exce&s;&s;ve and
&s;uper&s;titious fears. That humility which
checks pre&s;umption, and that jealou&s;y which
in&s;pires vigilance, are favourable to piety;
while tho&s;e &s;u&s;picious which lead to de|&s;pondency
are injurious to God, hurtful to
our&s;elves, and repugnant to that whole &s;y&s;|tem
of mercy which I have been illu&s;trating.</P>

were really obdurate, you would be in&s;en|&s;ible
of guilt. Your complaints of hardne&s;s
of heart are an evidence of your heart being
at that moment contrite and actually relent|ing.
&mdash;Are there any circum&s;tances of in|ward
di&s;compo&s;ure and perplexity of which
He is uncon&s;cious who at a critical period
of his life was <HI>heavy and &s;ore amazed</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Mark xiv. 33.</NOTE>; who
was obliged to complain that his &s;oul was
<HI>troubled within him;</HI> and to acknowledge,
that though <HI>the &s;pirit was willing, yet the
fle&s;h was weak?</HI> To a &s;uperiour nature,
untouched with human frailty, you might
in &s;uch &s;ituations look up with &s;ome degree
of terrour. But He who remembers the
&s;truggles of his own &s;oul, will not, &s;urely,
judge yours like a hard and unfeeling ma&s;|ter.
Acquainted with the inmo&s;t rece&s;&s;es of
human nature, he perceives the &s;incerity of
your intentions; he &s;ees the combat you
maintain; he knows how much of your
pre&s;ent confu&s;ion and di&s;order is to be im|puted,
not to your inclination and will, but
to an infirm, and aged or di&s;ea&s;ed body, or
<PB N="134" REF="141">
to a weak and wounded &s;pirit; and there|fore
will be far from rejecting your attempts
to &s;erve him, on account of the infirmities,
which you lament. He hears the voice of
tho&s;e &s;ecret a&s;pirations which you are unable
to expre&s;s in words, or to form into prayer.
Every penitential tear which your contrition
&s;heds, pleads your cau&s;e more powerfully
with him, than all the arguments with which
you could fill your mouth.</P>
<P>II. FROM our Saviour's experience of
human mi&s;ery, we may ju&s;tly hope that he
will &s;o compa&s;&s;ionately regard our di&s;tre&s;&s;ed
e&s;tate, as to prevent us from being loaded
with unnece&s;&s;ary troubles. He will not
wantonly add affliction to the afflicted; nor
willingly cru&s;h what he &s;ees to be already
broken. In the cour&s;e of that high admi|ni&s;tration
which he now exerci&s;es, he may
indeed judge certain intermixtures of ad|ver&s;ity
to be proper for our improvement.
The&s;e are trials of virtue through which all,
without exception, mu&s;t pa&s;s. Rugged was
the road by which our divine Mediator him|&s;elf
<PB N="135" REF="142">
went before us to glory; and be|coming
our companion in di&s;tre&s;s, he meant
to reconcile us to our lot. He ennobled
adver&s;ity, by &s;haring it with us. He rai&s;ed
poverty from contempt, by a&s;&s;uming it for
his own condition. The &s;everity of his
trials tends to lighten ours. When the ge|neral
of an army lies on the &s;ame hard
ground, drinks of the &s;ame cold &s;tream,
carries the &s;ame weight of armour with the
lowe&s;t centinel, can any of his &s;oldiers re|pine
a what they endure?</P>
<P>Whatever afflictions our Lord may judge
to be nece&s;&s;ary for us, of this we may re&s;t
a&s;&s;ured, that he will deal them forth, not
with har&s;h and imperious authority, but
with the tenderne&s;s of one who knows from
experience how deeply the human heart is
wounded by every &s;troke of adver&s;ity. He
will not lay more upon us than he &s;ees we
are able to bear. <HI>Though he cau&s;e grief, yet
will he have compa&s;&s;ion according to the mul|titude
of his tender mercies. He will &s;tay his
rough wind in the day of the ca&s;t wind</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">I&s;aiah xxvii. 8.</NOTE>.
<PB N="136" REF="143">
For it is his &s;tate, but not his nature, which
is now changed. Notwith&s;tanding his high
exaltation, he &s;till retains the compa&s;&s;ionate
&s;entiments of <HI>the man of &s;orrows.</HI> Still, we
are a&s;&s;ured by an in&s;pired writer, <HI>he is not
a&s;hamed to call us his brethren</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Heb. ii. 11.</NOTE>. And with
the heart of brother he regards tho&s;e few
and troubled days, &s;uch as his own once
were, which good men are doomed to pa&s;s
in this evil world.</P>
<P>From his compa&s;&s;ion, indeed, we are not
to expect that fond indulgence or un&s;ea&s;on|able
relief by which the weak pity of men
frequently injures its objects. It is to the
material intere&s;ts, more than to the present cafe, of good men, that he attends. When
under the impatience of &s;orrow we exclaim,
<HI>Hath he forgotten to be gracious? hath he
in anger &s;hut up his tender mercies?</HI> we re|collect
not in who&s;e hands we are. His
compa&s;&s;ion is not dimini&s;hed when its ope|rations
are mo&s;t concealed. It continues
equally to flow, though the channels by
which it is conducted towards us lie too
<PB N="137" REF="144">
deep for our ob&s;ervation. Amid&s;t our pre|&s;ent
ignorance of what is good or ill for us
in this life, it is &s;ufficient for us to know,
that the immediate admini&s;tration of uni|ver&s;al
government is placed in the hands of
the mo&s;t attentive and compa&s;&s;ionate friend
of mankind. How greatly does this con&s;i|deration
alleviate the burden of human woe!
How happily does it connect with the awful
di&s;pen&s;ations of religion the milde&s;t ideas of
tenderne&s;s and humanity!</P>
<P>III. THE text leads us to hope that
amid&s;t all the infirmities of our &s;tate, both
under the temptations and under the di&s;|tre&s;&s;es
of life, our ble&s;&s;ed Lord will afford
us a proper mea&s;ure of a&s;&s;i&s;tance and &s;up|port.
<HI>In that he hath &s;uffered being tempted,
he is able to &s;uccour them who</HI> either &s;uffer,
or <HI>are tempted</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Heb. ii. 18.</NOTE>; that is, he is perfectly
qualified for di&s;charging this beneficent
office; he knows exactly where the wound
bleeds, where the burden pre&s;&s;es, what re|lief
will prove mo&s;t &s;ea&s;onable, and how it
<PB N="138" REF="145">
can be mo&s;t &s;ucce&s;sfully applied. The
manner in which it is conveyed by him to
the heart we may be at a lo&s;s to explain;
but no argument can be thence drawn
again&s;t the credibility of the fact. The
operations which the power of God car|ries
on the natural world are no le&s;s
my&s;terious than tho&s;e which we are taught
to believe that his &s;pirit performs in the
moral world. If we can give no account
of what is every day before our eyes, how
a &s;eed becomes a tree, or how the child
ri&s;es into a man, is it any wonder that we
&s;hould be unable to explain how virtue is
&s;upported, and con&s;tancy &s;trengthened, by
God within the heart? If men by their
coun&s;els and &s;ugge&s;tions can influence the
minds of one another, mu&s;t not divine &s;ug|ge&s;tion
and coun&s;el produce a much greater
effect? Surely, the Father of Spirits mu&s;t,
by a thou&s;and ways, have acce&s;s to the &s;pi|rits
which he has made, &s;o as to give them
what determination, or impart to them
what a&s;&s;i&s;tance he thinks proper, without
injuring their frame, or di&s;turbing their
rational powers.</P>
<P><PB N="139" REF="146">
Accordingly, wherever any notions of
religion have taken place among mankind,
this belief has in &s;ome mea&s;ure prevailed,
that to the virtuous under di&s;tre&s;s aid was
communicated from above. This &s;enti|ment
is &s;o congruous to our natural impre&s;|&s;ions
of the divine benignity, that both
among poets and philo&s;ophers of antient
times it was a favourite idea, and often
occurs in their writings. But what among
them was no more than loo&s;e conjecture or
feeble hope has received full confirmation
from the go&s;pel of Chri&s;t. Not only is the
promi&s;e of divine a&s;&s;i&s;tance expre&s;sly given
to Chri&s;tians, but their faith in that promi&s;e
is &s;trengthened by an argument which mu&s;t
carry conviction to every heart. If Chri&s;t
had full experience of the in&s;ufficiency of
human nature to overcome the difficulties
wherewith it is now &s;urrounded, will he
withhold from his followers that grace
without which he &s;ees they mu&s;t peri&s;h in
the evil day? If in the &s;ea&s;on of his tempt|ation
and di&s;tre&s;s, an angel was &s;ent from
<PB N="140" REF="147">
heaven <HI>to &s;trengthen him</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Luke xxii. 43.</NOTE>, &s;hall no cele&s;tial
me&s;&s;enger be employed by him on the like
kind errand to tho&s;e whom he &s;tiles his
brethren? Can we believe that he who once
<HI>bore our griefs and carried our &s;orrows</HI> will,
from that height of glory to which he is
now exalted, look down upon us here con|tending
with the &s;torm of adver&s;ity, la|bouring
to follow his &s;teps through the
&s;teep and difficult paths of virtue, expo&s;ed
on every &s;ide to arrows aimed again&s;t us by
the powers of darkne&s;s; and that, &s;eeing our
di&s;tre&s;s, and hearing our &s;upplications, he
will remain an unconcerned &s;pectator,
without vouch&s;a&s;ing us either a&s;&s;i&s;tance to
&s;upport our frailty, or protection to &s;creen
us amid&s;t &s;urrounding dangers? Where
were then the benevolence of a divine Na|ture?
Where, the compa&s;&s;ion of that medi|ator
who was trained to mercy in the &s;chool
of &s;orrow? Far from us be &s;uch ungrateful
&s;u&s;picions of the generous friend of human
kind!&mdash;Let us exert our&s;elves as we can,
<PB N="141" REF="148">
and we &s;hall be a&s;&s;i&s;ted. Let us pray, and
we &s;hall be heard; for there is one to pre|&s;ent
our prayers whom <HI>the father heareth
always.</HI> The&s;e, will he &s;ay, are my fol|lowers
on earth, pa&s;&s;ing through that thorny
path of temptation and &s;orrow which I once
trode. <HI>Now I am no more in the world;
but the&s;e are in the world. Holy Father!
thine they were, and thou gave&s;t them me.
Keep them through thine own name. Sanc|tify
them through thy truth. Keep them
from the evil one; that they may be where I
am, and may behold the glory which thou
ha&s;t given me</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">John xvii.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Such is the comfort which ari&s;es to us
from our Saviour's participation of the in|firmities
of human nature; and thus it may
be applied to various &s;ituations of anxiety
and di&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>WHEN we review what has been &s;aid,
it is nece&s;&s;ary that, in the fir&s;t place, I
guard you again&s;t a certain mi&s;improve|ment
which may be made of this doctrine.
<PB N="142" REF="149">
The amiable view which it gives of our
Lord's clemency may flatter &s;ome men
with unwarrantable hopes, and lead them to
imagine that in his experience of human
weakne&s;s an apology is to be found for
every crime. Per&s;ons of this character
mu&s;t be taught that his compa&s;&s;ion differs
widely from that undi&s;tingui&s;hing and ca|pricious
indulgence which is &s;ometimes
found among men. It is the compa&s;&s;ion of
an impartial mind, enlightened by wi&s;|dom
and guided by ju&s;tice, extending to
the frailties of &s;incere, but not to the
&s;ins of the pre&s;umptuous, and lea&s;t of all to
the crimes of tho&s;e who encourage them|&s;elves
in evil from the hope that they &s;hall
meet with compa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>A cour&s;e deliberate guilt admits of no
apology from the weakne&s;s of human na|ture.
For notwith&s;tanding all the infirmi|ties
incident to it, no man is under a ne|ce&s;&s;ity
of being wicked. So far is our Sa|viour's
experience of our nature from
affording any ground of hope to pre&s;ump|tuous
offenders, that it ought to fill them
<PB N="143" REF="150">
with terrour. For it &s;hows them how tho|roughly
qualified he is to di&s;eriminate
accurately the characters of men, and to
mark the boundaries between frailty and
perver&s;ene&s;s. He who from his own feel|ings
well knows all the workings of the hu|man
heart, clearly di&s;cerns how different
their temper is from what was once his own.
He perceives that vice, not virtue, is
their choice; and that, in&s;tead of re&s;i&s;ting
temptation, they re&s;i&s;t con&s;cience. He &s;ees
that infirmity affords them no excu&s;e; and
that the real cau&s;e of their acting a criminal
part, is not becau&s;e they cannot do better,
but, in truth, becau&s;e they will not. Hav|ing
forfeited every title to compa&s;&s;ion, they
are left in the hands ju&s;tice; and ac|cording
<HI>as they have &s;own,</HI> they mu&s;t ex|cept
<HI>to reap.</HI></P>
<P>BUT, in the next place, to &s;uch as are
&s;incere and upright, the doctrine which I
have illu&s;trated affords high encouragement,
and powerfully recommends the Chri&s;tian
Religion. It places that religion in its pro|per
<PB N="144" REF="151">
point of view, as a medicinal plan, in|tended
both for the recovery of mankind
from guilt, and for their con&s;olation under
trouble. <HI>The law was given by Mo&s;es; but
grace and truth came by Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI> The
law was a di&s;pen&s;ation of mere authority.
The Go&s;pel is a di&s;pen&s;ation, not of autho|rity
only, but of relief. If it di&s;covers new
duties, and impo&s;es new obligations, it opens
al&s;o &s;ources of comfort which were before
unknown to the world.</P>
<P>A mediator between God and his crea|tures
was an object after which men in all
nations, and under all forms of religion,
had long and anxiou&s;ly &s;ought. The follies
of &s;uper&s;tition have &s;erved to di&s;clo&s;e to us,
in this in&s;tance, the &s;entiments of nature.
The whole religion of Pagani&s;m was a &s;y&s;|tem
of mediation and iterce&s;&s;ion. De|pre&s;&s;ed
by a con&s;cious &s;en&s;e of guilt, nature
&s;hrunk at the thought of adventuring on a
direct approach to the Sovereign of the uni|ver&s;e;
and laboured to find out &s;ome au&s;pi|cious
introductory to that awful pre&s;ence.
With blind and trembling eagerne&s;s, the
<PB N="145" REF="152">
nations fled to &s;ubordinate deities, to tutelar
gods, and to departed &s;pirits, as their pa|trons
and advocates above. Them they
&s;tudied to &s;ooth with &s;uch co&s;tyly gifts, &s;uch
pompous rites, of &s;uch humble &s;upplica|tions,
as they thought might incline them
to favour their cau&s;e, and to &s;upport their
intere&s;t with the Supreme Divinity. While
mankind were bewildered in this darkne&s;s,
the Go&s;pel not only revealed the true Me|diator,
who in this view may be ju&s;tly
called <HI>the de&s;ire of all nations,</HI> but placed his
character and office in a light mo&s;t admirably
fitted, as has been &s;hewn in this Di&s;cour&s;e,
to &s;upport the intere&s;t of virtue in the world;
and to encourage the humble, without flat|tering
the pre&s;umptuous. What plan of
religion could be more &s;uited to the circum|&s;tances
of man, or more worthy of the goodnes&s;s
of his Creator? What more ani|mating
to the pious wor&s;hipper in perform|ing
tho&s;e &s;olemn acts of devotion to which
we are called by the &s;ervice of this day?</P>
<P>I CANNOT conclude without taking no|tice
how remarkably this di&s;pen&s;ation of
<PB N="146" REF="153">
religion is calculated to promote a &s;pirit of
humanity and compa&s;&s;ion among men, by
tho&s;e very means which it employs for in|&s;piring
devotion towards God. We are
now drawing nigh to the Supreme Being
through a Mediator, for who&s;e compa&s;&s;ion
we pray on account of the experience which
he has had of our frailty. We tru&s;t, that
having been acquainted with di&s;tre&s;s, he
<HI>will not de&s;pi&s;e nor abhor the affliction of the
afflicted.</HI> The argument by which we plead
for his compa&s;&s;ion concludes &s;till more
&s;trongly for mutual charity, and &s;ympathy
with one another. He who, in the mid&s;t
of the common &s;ufferings of life, feels not
for the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed; he who relents not at his
neighbour's griefs, nor &s;cans his failings
with the eye of a brother, mu&s;t be &s;en&s;ible
that he excludes him&s;elf from the commi|&s;eration
of Chri&s;t. He makes void the ar|gument
by which he pleads for his mercy;
nay he e&s;tabli&s;hes a precedent again&s;t him|&s;elf.
Thus the Chri&s;tian religion approves
it&s;elf as worthy of God, by connecting de|votion
in &s;trict union with charity. As in
<PB N="147" REF="154">
its precepts the love of God and the love of
man are joined, &s;o in its in&s;titutions the
exerci&s;e of both is called forth; and to wor|&s;hip
god through the mediation of a com|pa&s;&s;ionate
high prie&s;t, nece&s;&s;arily &s;uppo&s;es
in the wor&s;hippers a &s;pirit of compa&s;&s;ion
towards their own brethren.</P>

al&s;o which are &s;eemingly the mo&s;t fair and
innocent, &s;uch as the de&s;ire of e&s;teem and
prai&s;e. Of this the text &s;ugge&s;ts a remark|able
in&s;tance. When our Lord appeared
in the land of Judaea, the purity of his doc|trine,
and the evidence of his miracles, ac|quired
him a con&s;iderable number of fol|lowers,
chiefly among the lower cla&s;&s;es of
men. But the Phari&s;ees, who were the
leading and fa&s;hionable &s;ect, galled with
the freedom of his reproofs, decried him as
an impo&s;tor. Hence it came to pa&s;s, that
though <HI>&s;ome of the rulers believed in him, yet,
becau&s;e of the Phari&s;ees, they did not confe&s;s

one whom in their hearts they revered:
for which, this rea&s;on is given, that <HI>they
loved the prai&s;e of men more than the prai&s;e

mi&s;lead men into &s;uch culpable and di&s;ho|ne&s;t
<PB N="150" REF="157">
conduct, let us, with &s;ome attention,
examine the nature of this pa&s;&s;ion. Let us
con&s;ider how far it is an allowable principle
of action; when it begins to be criminal;
and upon what accounts we ought to guard
again&s;t its acquiring the entire a&s;cendant.</P>
<P>WE are intended by Providence to be con|nected
with one another in &s;ociety. Single
una&s;&s;i&s;ted individuals could make &s;mall ad|vances
towards any valuable improvement.
By means of &s;ociety our wants are &s;upplied,
and our lives rendered comfortable; our
capacities are enlarged, and our virtuous af|fections
called forth into proper exerci&s;e.
In order to confirm our mutual connection,
it was nece&s;&s;ary that &s;ome attracting power,
which had the effect of drawing men toge|ther,
and &s;trengthening the &s;ocial ties, &s;hould
pervade the human &s;y&s;tem. Nothing could
more happily fulfil this purpo&s;e, than our
being &s;o formed as to de&s;ire the e&s;teem, and
to delight in the good opinion, of each other.
Had &s;uch a propen&s;ity been wanting, and
&s;elfi&s;h principles left to occupy its place, &s;o|ciety
<PB N="151" REF="158">
mu&s;t have proved an unharmonious
and di&s;cordant &s;tate. In&s;tead of mutual at|traction,
a repul&s;ive power would have pre|vailed.
Among men who had no regard
to the approbation of one another, all in|tercour&s;e
would have been jarring and of|fen&s;ive.
For the wi&s;e&s;t ends, therefore, the
de&s;ire of prai&s;e was made an original and
powerful principle in the human brea&s;t.</P>
<P>To a variety of good purpo&s;es it is &s;ub|&s;ervient,
and on many occa&s;ions co-operates
with the principle of virtue. It awakens
us from &s;loth, invigorates activity, and
&s;timulates our efforts to excel. It has given
ri&s;e to mo&s;t of the &s;plendid, and to many of
the u&s;eful enterprizes of men. It has ani|mated
the patriot, and fired the hero. Mag|nanimity,
genero&s;ity and fortitude are what
all mankind admire. Hence &s;uch as were
actuated by the de&s;ire of exten&s;ive &s;ame,
have been prompted to deeds which either
participated of the &s;pirit, or, at lea&s;t, car|ried
the appearance of di&s;tingui&s;hed virtue.
The de&s;ire of prai&s;e is generally connected
with all the &s;iner &s;en&s;ibilities of human na|ture.
<PB N="152" REF="159">
It affords a ground on which exhort|ation,
coun&s;el and reproof can work a pro|per
effect. Whereas to be entirely de&s;titute
of this pa&s;&s;ion betokens an ignoble mind,
on which no moral impre&s;&s;ion is ea&s;ily
made. Where there is no de&s;ire of prai&s;e,
there will be al&s;o no &s;en&s;e of reproach; and
if that be extingui&s;hed, one of the princi|pal
guards of virtue is removed, and the
mind thrown open to many opprobrious
pur&s;uits. He who&s;e countenance never
glowed with &s;hame, and who&s;e heart never
beat at the &s;ound of prai&s;e, is not de&s;tined
for any honourable di&s;tinction; is likely to
grovel in the &s;ordid que&s;t of gain, or to
&s;lumber life away in the indolence of &s;elfi&s;h
plea&s;ures.</P>
<P>Ab&s;tracting from the &s;entiments which
are connected with the love of prai&s;e as a

is an object which, on ac|count
of the advantages it brings, may be
lawfully pur&s;ued. It is nece&s;&s;ary to our
&s;ucce&s;s in every fair and hone&s;t undertak|ing.
Not only our private intere&s;t, but our
<PB N="153" REF="160">
public u&s;efulne&s;s, depends in a great mea&s;ure
upon it. The &s;phere of our influence is
contracted or enlarged in proportion to the
degree in which we enjoy the good opinion
of the public. Men li&s;ten with an unwil|ling
ear to one whom they do not honour;
while a re&s;pected character adds weight to
example, and authority to coun&s;el. To
de&s;ire the e&s;teem of others for the &s;ake of
its effects is not only allowable, but in ma|ny
ca&s;es is our duty: and to be totally in|different
to prai&s;e or cen&s;ure, is &s;o far from
being a virtue, that it is a real defect in
character.</P>
<P>BUT while the love of prai&s;e is admitted
to be in &s;o many re&s;pects a natural and u&s;e|ful
principle of action, we are at the &s;ame
time to ob&s;erve that it is entitled to no more
than our &s;econdary regard. It has its
boundaries &s;et; by tran&s;gre&s;&s;ing which, it is
at once transformed from an innocent into a
mo&s;t dangerous pa&s;&s;ion. More &s;acred and
venerable principles claim the chief direc|tion
of human conduct. All the good ef|fects
<PB N="154" REF="161">
which we have a&s;cribed to the de&s;ire
of prai&s;e, are produced by it when remain|ing
in a &s;ubordinate &s;tation. But when
pa&s;&s;ing its natural line, it becomes the ru|ling
&s;pring of conduct; when the regard
which we pay to the opinions of men, in|croaches
on that reverence which we owe
to the voice of con&s;cience and the &s;en&s;e of
duty; the love of prai&s;e having then gone
out of its proper place, in&s;tead of improv|ing,
corrupts; and in&s;tead of elevating, de|ba&s;es
our nature. The proportion which this
pa&s;&s;ion holds to other principles of action is
what renders it either innocent or criminal.
The crime with which the Jewi&s;h rulers are
charged in the text, was not that they loved
the pra&s;e of men; but that they loved it
<HI>more than the prai&s;e of God.</HI></P>
<P>Even in ca&s;es where there is no direct
competition between our duty and our
fancied honour, between the prai&s;e of men
and the prai&s;e of God, the pa&s;&s;ion for ap|plau&s;e
may become criminal by occupying
the place of a better principle. When vain|glory
u&s;urps the throne of virtue; when
<PB N="155" REF="162">
o&s;tentation produces actions which con&s;ci|ence
ought to have dictated; &s;uch actions,
however &s;pecious, have no claim to moral
or religious prai&s;e. We know that good
deeds done merely <HI>to be &s;een of men</HI> lo&s;e
their reward with God. If, on occa&s;ion of
&s;ome trying conjuncture which makes us
he&s;itate concerning our line of conduct, the
fir&s;t que&s;tion which occurs to us be, not
whether an action is right in it&s;elf, and &s;uch
as a good man ought to perform, but whe|ther
it is &s;uch as will find acceptance with
the world, and be favourable to our fame,
the conclu&s;ion is too evident that the de&s;ire
of applau&s;e has obtained an undue a&s;cendant.
What a wi&s;e and good man ought to &s;tudy,
is to pre&s;erve his mind free from any &s;uch
&s;olicitude concerning prai&s;e as may be in
hazard of overcoming his &s;en&s;e of duty.
The approbation of men he may wi&s;h to
obtain, as far as is con&s;i&s;tent with the ap|probation
of God. But when both cannot
be enjoyed together, there ought to be no
&s;u&s;pence. He is to retire contented with
the te&s;timony of a good con&s;cience; and to
<PB N="156" REF="163">
&s;how by the firmne&s;s of his behaviour, that,
in the cau&s;e of truth and virtue, he is &s;upe|riour
to all opinion.&mdash;Let us now proceed
to con&s;ider the arguments which &s;hould
&s;upport &s;uch a &s;pirit, and guard us again&s;t
the improper influence of prai&s;e or cen&s;ure
in the cour&s;e of our duty.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place, the prai&s;e of men is
not an object of any &s;uch value in it&s;elf as
to be entitled to become the leading princi|ple
of conduct. We degrade our charac|ter
when we allow it more than &s;ubordinate
regard. Like other worldly goods, it is
apt to dazzle us with a fal&s;e lu&s;tre; but if
we would a&s;certain its true worth, let us
reflect both on whom it is be&s;towed, and
from whom it proceeds. Were the applau&s;e
of the world always the reward of merit;
were it appropriated to &s;uch alone as by real
abilities, or by worthy actions, are entitled
to ri&s;e above the crowd, we might ju&s;tly
be flattered by po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing a rare and valuable
di&s;tinction. But how far is this from be|ing
the ca&s;e in fact? How often have the
<PB N="157" REF="164">
de&s;picable and the vile, by dexterou&s;ly
catching the favour of the multitude, &s;oared
upon the wings of popular applau&s;e, while
the virtuous and the de&s;erving have been
either buried in ob&s;curity, or obliged to
encounter the attacks of unju&s;t reproach?
The laurels which human prai&s;e confers are
withered and bla&s;ted by the unworthine&s;s
of tho&s;e who wear them. Let the man
who is vain of public favour be humbled by
the reflection that, in the mid&s;t of his &s;uc|ce&s;s,
he is mingled with a crowd of impo&s;|tors
and deceivers, of hypocrites and en|thu&s;ia&s;ts,
of ignorant pretenders and &s;uper|ficial
rea&s;oners, who, by various arts, have
attained as high a rank as him&s;elf in tem|porary
fame.</P>
<P>We may ea&s;ily be &s;atisfied that applau&s;e
will be often &s;hared by the unde&s;erving, if
we allow our&s;elves to con&s;ider from whom
it proceeds. When it is the approbation of
the wi&s;e only and the good which is pur|&s;ued,
the love of prai&s;e may then be ac|counted
to contain it&s;elf within ju&s;t bounds,
and to run in its proper channel. But the
<PB N="158" REF="165">
te&s;timony of the di&s;cerning few, mode&s;t and
una&s;&s;uming as they commonly are, forms
but a &s;mall part of the public voice. It &s;el|dom
amounts to more than a whi&s;per, which
amid&s;t the general clamour is drowned.
When the love of prai&s;e has taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion
of the mind, it confines not it&s;elf to an ob|ject
&s;o limited. It grows into an appetite
for indi&s;criminate prai&s;e. And who are
they that confer this prai&s;e? A mixed mul|titude
of men, who in their whole conduct
are guided by humour and caprice, far more
than by rea&s;on; who admire fal&s;e appear|ances,
and pur&s;ue fal&s;e goods; who inquire
&s;uperficially, and judge ra&s;hly; who&s;e &s;enti|ments
are for the mo&s;t part erroneous, always
changeable, and often incon&s;i&s;tent. Nor
let any one imagine, that by looking above
the crowd, and courting the prai&s;e of the
fa&s;hionable and the great, he makes &s;ure of
true honour. There are a great vulgar, as
well as a &s;mall. Rank often makes no dif|ference
in the under&s;tandings of men, or in
their judicious di&s;tribution of prai&s;e. Luxury,
pride, and vanity, have frequently as much
<PB N="159" REF="166">
influence in corrupting the &s;entiments of
the great, as ignorance, bigotry, and pre|judice,
have in mi&s;leading the opinions of
the crowd.&mdash;And is it to &s;uch judges as
the&s;e that you &s;ubmit the &s;upreme direction
of your conduct? Do you &s;toop to court
their favour as your chief di&s;tinction, when
an object of &s;o much ju&s;ter and higher am|bition
is pre&s;ented to you in <HI>the prai&s;e of
God?</HI> God is the only unerring judge of
what is excellent. His approbation alone
is the &s;ub&s;tance, all other prai&s;e is but the
&s;hadow, of honour. The character which
you bear in his &s;ight is your only real one.
How contemptible does it render you to be
indifferent with re&s;pect to this, and to be
&s;olicitous about a name alone, a fictitious,
imaginary character, which has no exi&s;t|ence
except in the opinions of a few weak
and credulous men around you? They &s;ee
no farther then the out&s;ide of things. They
can judge of you by actions only; and not
by the comprehen&s;ive view of all your ac|tions,
but by &s;uch merely as you have had
opportunity of bringing forth to public no|tice.
<PB N="160" REF="167">
But the Sovereign of the world be|holds
you in every light in which you can
be placed. The &s;ilent virtues of a generous
purpo&s;e and a pious heart attract his notice
equally with the mo&s;t &s;plendid deeds. From
him you may reap the prai&s;e of good actions
which you had no opportunity of perform|ing.
For he &s;ees them in their principle;
he judges of you by your intentions; he
knows what you would have done. You
may be in his eyes a hero or a martyr,
without undergoing the labours of the one,
or the &s;ufferings of the other. His in&s;pec|tion,
therefore, opens a much wider field
for prai&s;e than what the world can afford
you; and for prai&s;e, too, certainly far more
illu&s;trious in the eye of rea&s;on. Every real
arti&s;t &s;tudies to approve him&s;elf to &s;uch as
are knowing in his art. To their judgment
he appeals. On their approbation he re&s;ts
his character, and not on the prai&s;e of the
un&s;killed and rude. In the highe&s;t art of
all, that of life and conduct, &s;hall the opi|nions
of ignorant men come into the mo&s;t
di&s;tant competition with his approbation
<PB N="161" REF="168">
who is the &s;earcher of all hearts, and the
&s;tandard of all perfection?&mdash;The te&s;timony
of his prai&s;e is not indeed, as yet, openly
be&s;towed. But though the voice of the Al|mighty
&s;ound not in your ears, yet by con|&s;cience,
his &s;acred vicegerent, it is capable
of being conveyed to your heart. The
&s;ofte&s;t whi&s;per of divine approbation is
&s;weeter to the &s;oul of a virtuous man, than
the loude&s;t &s;houts of that tumultuary ap|plau&s;e
which proceeds from the world.</P>
<P>Con&s;ider, farther, how narrow and cir|cum&s;cribed
in its limits that fame is which
the vain-glorious man &s;o eagerly pur&s;ues.
In order to &s;hew him this, I &s;hall not bid
him reflect that it is confined to a &s;mall
di&s;trict of the earth; and that when he looks
a little beyond the region which he inhabits,
he will find him&s;elf as much unknown as
the mo&s;t ob&s;cure per&s;on around him. I
&s;hall not de&s;ire him to con&s;ider, that in the
gulph of oblivion, where all human me|morials
are &s;wallowed up, his name and
fame mu&s;t &s;oon be inevitably lo&s;t. He may
imagine that ample honours remain to gra|tify
<PB N="162" REF="169">
ambition, though his reputation extend
not over the whole globe, nor la&s;t till the
end of time. But let him calmly reflect,
that within the narrow boundaries of that
country to which he belongs, and during
that &s;mall portion of time which his life fills
up, his reputation, great as he may fancy
it to be, occupies no more than an incon|&s;iderable
corner. Let him think what mul|titudes
of tho&s;e among whom he dwells are
totally ignorant of his name and character;
how many imagine them&s;elves too import|ant
to regard him; how many are too much
occupied with their own wants and pur&s;uits
to pay him the lea&s;t attention; and where
his reputation is in any degree &s;pread, how
often it has been attacked, and how many
rivals are daily ri&s;ing to abate it: Having
attended to the&s;e circum&s;tances, he will find
&s;ufficient materials for humiliation in the
mid&s;t of the highe&s;t applau&s;e.&mdash;From all
the&s;e con&s;iderations it clearly appears, that
though the e&s;teem of our fellow-creatures
be plea&s;ing, and the pur&s;uit of it, in a mo|derate
degree, be fair and lawful, yet that
<PB N="163" REF="170">
it affords no &s;uch object to de&s;ire as entitles
it to be a ruling principle.</P>
<P>IN the &s;econd place, an exce&s;&s;ive love of
prai&s;e never fails to undermine the regard
due to con&s;cience, and to corrupt the heart.
It turns off the eye of the mind from the
ends which it ought chiefly to keep in view;
and &s;ets up a fal&s;e light for its guide. Its
influence is the more dangerous, as the co|lour
which it a&s;&s;umes is often fair; and its
garb and appearance are nearly allied to
that of virtue. The love of glory, I before
admitted, may give birth to actions which
are both &s;plendid and u&s;eful. At a di&s;tance
they &s;trike the eye with uncommon bright|ne&s;s;
but on a nearer and &s;tricter &s;urvey,
their lu&s;tre is often tarni&s;hed. They are
found to want that &s;acred and venerable dig|nity
which characterizes true virtue. Little
pa&s;&s;ions and &s;elfi&s;h intere&s;ts entered into the
motives of tho&s;e who performed them. They
were jealous of a competitor. They &s;ought
to humble a rival. They looked round for
&s;pectators to admire them. All is magna|nimity,
<PB N="164" REF="171">
genero&s;ity, and courage, to public
view. But the ignoble &s;ource whence the&s;e
&s;eeming virtues take their ri&s;e is hidden.
Without, appears the hero; within, is found
the man of du&s;t and clay. Con&s;ult &s;uch as
have been intimately connected with the
followers of renown; and &s;eldom or never
will you find that they held them in the
&s;ame e&s;teem with tho&s;e who viewed them
from afar. There is nothing except &s;im|plicity
of intention, and purity of principle,
that can &s;tand the te&s;t of near approach and
&s;trict examination.</P>
<P>But &s;uppo&s;ing the virtue of vain-glorious
men not to be always fal&s;e, it certainly can|not
be depended upon as firm or &s;ure. Con|&s;tancy
and &s;teadine&s;s are to be looked for
from him only who&s;e conduct is regulated
by a &s;en&s;e of what is right; <HI>who&s;e prai&s;e is
not of men, but of God;</HI> who&s;e motive to di&s;|charge
his duty is always the &s;ame. Change,
as much as you plea&s;e, the &s;ituation of &s;uch
a man; let applau&s;e or let cen&s;ure be his
lot; let the public voice, which this day has
extolled him, to-morrow as loudly decry
<PB N="165" REF="172">
him; on the tenour of his behaviour the&s;e
changes produce no effect. He moves in a
higher &s;phere. As the &s;un in his orbit is
not interrupted by the mi&s;ts and &s;torms of
the atmo&s;phere below, &s;o, regardle&s;s of the
opinions of men, <HI>through honour and di&s;|honour,
through good report and bad report,</HI>
he pur&s;ues the path which con&s;cience has
marked out. Whereas the apparent virtues
of that man who&s;e eye is fixed on the world,
are precarious and temporary. Supported
only by circum&s;tances, occa&s;ions, and par|ticular
regards, they fluctuate and fall with
the&s;e. Excited by public admiration, they
di&s;appear when it is withdrawn; like tho&s;e
exhalations which, rai&s;ed by heat from the
earth, glitter in the air with momentary
&s;plendour, and then fall back to the ground
from whence they &s;prung.</P>
<P>The intemperate love of prai&s;e not only
weakens the true principles of probity, by
&s;ub&s;tituting inferior motives in their &s;tead,
but frequently al&s;o impels men to actions
which are directly criminal. It obliges them
to follow the current of popular opinion
<PB N="166" REF="173">
whither&s;oever it may carry them; and hence
<HI>&s;hipwreck</HI> is often made both <HI>of faith and of
a good con&s;cience.</HI> According as circum|&s;tances
lead them to court the acclamations
of the multitude, or to pur&s;ue the applau&s;e
of the great, vices of different kinds will
&s;tain their character. In one &s;ituation they
will make hypocritical profe&s;&s;ions of reli|gion.
In another, they will be a&s;hamed of
their Redeemer, and of his words. They
will be afraid to appear in their own form,
or to utter their genuine &s;entiments. Their
whole character will become fictitious; opi|nions
will be a&s;&s;umed, &s;peech and behaviour
modelled, and even the countenance formed,
as prevailing ta&s;te exacts. From one who
has &s;ubmitted to &s;uch pro&s;titution for the
&s;ake of prai&s;e, you can no longer expect
fidelity or attachment on any trying occa|&s;ion.
In private life, he will be a timorous
and treacherous friend. In public conduct,
he will be &s;upple and ver&s;atile; ready to de|&s;ert
the cau&s;e which he had e&s;pou&s;ed, and
to veer with every &s;hifting wind of popular
favour. In &s;ine, all becomes unfound and
<PB N="167" REF="174">
hollow in that heart where, in&s;tead of re|gard
to the divine approbation, there reigns
the &s;overeign de&s;ire of plea&s;ing men.</P>
<P>IN the third place, this pa&s;&s;ion, when it
becomes predominant, mo&s;t commonly de|feats
its own end, and deprives men of the
honour which they are &s;o eager to gain.
Without pre&s;erving liberty and independ|ence,
we can never command re&s;pect.
That &s;ervility of &s;pirit which &s;ubjects us to
the opinions of others, and renders us tri|butaries
to the world for the &s;ake of ap|plau&s;e,
is what all mankind de&s;pi&s;e. They
look up with reverence to one who, un|awed
by their cen&s;ures, acts according to
his own &s;en&s;e of things, and follows the free
impul&s;e of an honourable mind. But him
who hangs totally on their judgment, they
con&s;ider as their va&s;&s;al. They even enjoy
a malignant plea&s;ure in humbling his vanity,
and withholding that prai&s;e which he is &s;een
to court. By artifice and &s;how he may
&s;hine for a time in the public eye; but it is
only as long as he can &s;upport the belief of
<PB N="168" REF="175">
acting from principle. When the incon|&s;i&s;tencies
into which he falls detect his cha|racter,
his reputation pa&s;&s;es away, like the
pageant of a day. No man ever obtained
la&s;ting fame who did not, on &s;everal occa|&s;ions,
contradict the prejudices of popular opinion.</P>
<P>There is no cour&s;e of behaviour which
will at all times plea&s;e all men. That which
plea&s;es mo&s;t univer&s;ally, and which only
commands durable prai&s;e, is religion and
virtue. Sincere piety towards God, kind
affection to men, and fidelity in the di&s;|charge
of all the duties of life; a con&s;cience
pure and undefiled; a heart firm to ju&s;tice
and to truth, &s;uperiour to all terrours that
would &s;hake, and in&s;en&s;ible to all ple&s;ures
that would betray it; unconquerable by the
oppo&s;ition of the world, and re&s;igned to
God alone; the&s;e are the qualities which
render a man truly re&s;pectable and great.
Such a character may, in evil times, incur
unju&s;t reproach. But the clouds which envy
or prejudice has gathered around it will gra|dually
di&s;per&s;e; and its brightne&s;s will come
<PB N="169" REF="176">
forth, in the end, as the noon day. As
&s;oon as it is thoroughly known, it finds a
witne&s;s in every brea&s;t. It forces approba|tion
even from the mo&s;t degenerate. The
human heart is &s;o formed as to be attuned,
if we may u&s;e the expre&s;&s;ion, to its prai&s;e.
In fact, it is this firm and inflexible virtue,
this determined regard to principle beyond
all opinion, which has crowned the charac|ters
of &s;uch as now &s;tand highe&s;t in the rolls
of la&s;ting fame. The truly illu&s;trious are
they who did not court the prai&s;e of the
world, but who performed the actions which
de&s;erved it. They were perhaps traduced,
in their lifetime, by tho&s;e whom they op|po&s;ed.
But po&s;terity has done them ample
ju&s;tice; and they are the men whom the
voice of ages now concurs in celebrating.
<HI>The memorial of virtue is immortal; becau&s;e
it is approved of God and of men. When it
is pre&s;ent, men take example at it; and when
it is gone, they de&s;ire it. It weareth a crown,
and triumpheth for ever; having gotten the
victory; &s;triving for undefiled rewards</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Wi&s;dom of Solomon, iv. 1, 2.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="170" REF="177">
IN the fourth place, as an immoderate
pa&s;&s;ion for human prai&s;e is dangerous to vir|tue,
and unfavourable to true honour, &s;o it
is de&s;tructive of &s;elf-enjoyment and in|ward
peace. Regard to the prai&s;e of God
pre&s;cribes a &s;imple and con&s;i&s;tent tenour of
conduct, which in all &s;ituations is the &s;ame;
which engages us in no perplexities, and
requires no artful refinement. <HI>Walking
uprightly, we walk &s;urely,</HI> becau&s;e we tread
an even and open path. But he who turns
a&s;ide from the &s;traight road of duty in order
to gain applau&s;e, involves him&s;elf in an in|tricate
labyrinth. He will be often embar|ra&s;&s;ed
concerning the cour&s;e which he ought
to hold. His mind will be always on the
&s;tretch. He will be obliged to li&s;ten with
anxious attention to every whi&s;per of the
popular voice. The demands of tho&s;e ma|&s;ters
whom he has &s;ubmitted to &s;erve, will
prove frequently contradictory and incon|&s;i&s;tent.
He has prepared a yoke for his
neck which he mu&s;t re&s;olve to bear, how
much &s;oever it may gall him.</P>
<P><PB N="171" REF="178">
The toils of virtue are honourable. The
mind is &s;upported under them by the con|&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s
of acting a right and becoming
part. But the labours to which he is doom|ed
who is en&s;laved to the de&s;ire of prai&s;e,
are aggravated by reflexion both on the un|certainty
of the recompence which he pur|&s;ues,
and on the deba&s;ement to which he
&s;ubmits. Con&s;cience will from time to
time remind him of the improper &s;acrifices
which he has made, and of the forfeiture
which he has incurred of the prai&s;e of God
for the &s;ake of prai&s;e from men. Suppo&s;e
him to receive all the rewards which the
mi&s;taken opinion of the world can be&s;tow,
its loude&s;t applau&s;e will often be unable to
drown the upbraidings of an inward voice;
and if a man is reduced to be a&s;hamed of
him&s;elf, what avails it him to be care&s;&s;ed by
others?</P>
<P>But, in truth, the reward towards which
be looks who proposes human prai&s;e as his
ultimate object, will be always flying, like
a &s;hadow, before him. So capricious and
uncertain, &s;o &s;ickle and mutable is the fa|vour
<PB N="172" REF="179">
of the multitude, that it proves the
mo&s;t un&s;atisfactory of all pur&s;uits in which
men can be engaged. He who &s;ets his
heart on it, is preparing for him&s;elf perpe|tual
mortifications. If the greate&s;t and be&s;t
can &s;eldom retain it long, we may ea&s;ily
believe that from the vain and unde&s;erving
it will &s;uddenly e&s;cape. There is no cha|racter
but what on &s;ome &s;ide is vulnerable
by cen&s;ure. He who lifts him&s;elf up to the
ob&s;ervation and notice of the world is, of
all men, the lea&s;t likely to avoid it. For
he draws upon him&s;elf a thou&s;and eyes that
will narrowly in&s;pect him in every part.
Every opportunity will be watched of bring|ing
him down to the common level. His
errours will be more divulged, and his in|firmities
more magnified, than tho&s;e of
others. In proportion to his eagerne&s;s for
prai&s;e will be his &s;en&s;ibility to reproach.
Nor is it reproach alone that will wound
him. He will be as much dejected by &s;i|lence
and neglect. He puts him&s;elf under
the power of every one to humble him,
by with-holding expected prai&s;e. Even
<PB N="173" REF="180">
when prai&s;e is be&s;towed, he is mortified
by its being either faint or trite. He pines
when his reputation &s;tagnates. The degree
of applau&s;e to which he has been accu&s;tom|ed
grows in&s;ipid; and to be always prai&s;ed
from the fame topics, becomes at la&s;t much
the &s;ame with not being prai&s;ed at all.</P>
<P>All the&s;e chagrins and di&s;quietudes are
happily avoided by him who keeps &s;o trou|ble&s;ome
a pa&s;&s;ion within its due bounds;
who is more de&s;irous of being truly worthy
than of being thought &s;o; who pur&s;ues the
prai&s;e of the world with manly temperance,
and in &s;ubordination to the prai&s;e of God.
He is neither made giddy by the intoxicat|ing
vapour of applau&s;e, nor humbled and
ca&s;t down by the unmerited attacks of cen|&s;ure.
Re&s;ting on a higher approbation he
enjoys him&s;elf in peace, whether human
prai&s;e &s;tays with him, or flies away. <HI>With
me it is a &s;mall thing to be judged of you, or of
man's judgment. He that judgeth me is the
Lord. My witne&s;s is in Heaven, and my
record is on high.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="174" REF="181">
IN the fifth and la&s;t place, the advan|tages
which redound from the prai&s;e of men,
are not &s;uch as can bear to be put in com|petition
with tho&s;e which flow from the
prai&s;e of God. The former are nece&s;&s;arily
confined within the verge of our pre&s;ent
exi&s;tence. The latter follow us beyond
the grave, and extend through all eternity.
Not only is the prai&s;e of men limited in its
effects to this life, but al&s;o to particular &s;itua|tions
of it. In the days of health and ea&s;e
it may brighten the &s;un&s;hine of pro&s;perity.
It may then &s;ooth the ear with plea&s;ing ac|cents,
and gratify the imagination with fan|cied
triumphs. But when the di&s;tre&s;sful
&s;ea&s;ons of life arrive, it will be found alto|gether
hollow and un&s;ub&s;tantial: And &s;ure|ly,
the value of any po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion is to be chiefly
e&s;timated by the relief which it can bring
us in the time of our greate&s;t need. When
the mind is ca&s;t down with &s;orrow and
grief, when &s;ickne&s;s &s;preads its gloom
around us, or death ri&s;es in awful pro&s;pect
to our view, the opinions and the di&s;|cour&s;es
of the world will appear trifling and
<PB N="175" REF="182">
in&s;ignificant. To one who is occupied
with nearer and more affecting intere&s;ts,
the prai&s;e or the cen&s;ure of the world will
&s;eem like the noi&s;e of di&s;tant voices, in
which he has &s;mall concern. But then is
the &s;ea&s;on when the prai&s;e of God &s;upports
and upholds the labouring &s;oul. Brought
home to the heart by the te&s;timony of a
good con&s;cience, and by <HI>the divine &s;pirit
bearing witne&s;s with our &s;pirits,</HI> it in&s;pires
fortitude, and produces a <HI>peace which pa&s;&s;eth
under&s;tanding.</HI></P>
<P>At pre&s;ent we behold an irregular and
di&s;ordered &s;tate of things. Virtue is often
deprived of its proper honours, and vice
u&s;urps them in its &s;tead. The characters of
men are mi&s;taken; and ignorance and folly
di&s;po&s;e of human applau&s;e. But the day
ha&s;tens apace which &s;hall clo&s;e this &s;cene of
errours, and vindicate the rights of ju&s;tice
and truth. Then <HI>&s;hall be rendered to every
man according to his works.</HI> Envy &s;hall no
longer have the power of ob&s;curing merit,
nor popular prejudices be able to &s;upport
the unde&s;erving. Hidden worth &s;hall be
<PB N="176" REF="183">
brought to light, and &s;ecret crimes revealed
Many who pa&s;&s;ed through the world in the
&s;ilent ob&s;curity of humble, but &s;teady good|ness,
&s;hall be di&s;tingui&s;hed as the favourites
of Heaven; while the proud, the ambitious,
and the vain, are left to everla&s;ting di&s;ho|nour.
The great Judge hath declared, that
<HI>who&s;oever has been a&s;hamed of him and of his
words, of that man &s;hall he be a&s;hamed when
he cometh in the glory of his Father, with all
the holy angels.</HI> Every departure from duty
&s;hall at the period of final di&s;tribution ter|minate
in ignominy. True honour and true
virtue &s;hall be &s;een to coincide; and when
all human fame has pa&s;&s;ed away like &s;moke,
the only prai&s;e which &s;hall be for ever re|membered
is that divine te&s;timony, <HI>Well
done, thou good and faithful &s;ervant; enter
thou into the joy of thy Lord.</HI></P>
<P>THESE arguments clearly &s;how the im|portance
of pre&s;erving the love of prai&s;e
under proper &s;ubordination to the principle
of duty. In it&s;elf, it is an u&s;eful motive to
action; but when allowed to extend its
<PB N="177" REF="184">
influence too far, it corrupts the whole
character, and produces guilt, di&s;grace, and
mi&s;ery. To be entirely de&s;titute of it, is
a defect. To be governed by it, is depra|vity.
The proper adju&s;tment of the &s;everal
principles of action in human nature is a
matter that de&s;erves our highe&s;t attention.
For when any one of them becomes either
too weak or too &s;trong, it endangers both
our virtue and our happine&s;s. <HI>Keep thy
heart therefore with all diligence;</HI> pray that
God would enable thee to keep it with &s;uc|ce&s;s;

<Q>Vanity of vanities, &s;aith the preacher, all is
vanity.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>NO &s;erious maxim has been more ge|nerally
adopted than that of the text.<NOTE PLACE="marg">SERM. VII.</NOTE>
In every age, the vanity of human life has
been the theme of declamation, and the &s;ub|ject
of complaint. It is a conclu&s;ion in which
men of all characters and ranks, the high
and the low, the young and the old, the
religious and the worldly, have more fre|quently
concurred than in any other. But
how ju&s;t &s;oever the conclu&s;ion may be, the
premi&s;es from which it is drawn are often
<PB N="179" REF="186">
fal&s;e. For it is prompted by various mo|tives,
and derived from very different views
of things. Sometimes the language of the
text is a&s;&s;umed by a &s;ceptic who cavils at
Providence, and cen&s;ures the con&s;titution of
the world. Sometimes it is the complaint
of a peevi&s;h man who is di&s;contented with
his &s;tation, and ruffled by the di&s;appoint|ment
of unrea&s;onable hopes. Sometimes it
is the &s;tyle of the licentious, when groan|ing
under mi&s;eries in which their vices have
involved them. Invectives again&s;t the va|nity
of the world which come from any of
the&s;e quarters de&s;erve no regard; as they
are the dictates of impiety, of &s;pleen, or of
folly. The only ca&s;e in which the &s;enti|ment
of the text claims our attention, is
when uttered, not as an a&s;per&s;ion on Pro|vidence,
or a reflection on human affairs in
general; not as the language of private di&s;|content,
or the re&s;ult of guilty &s;ufferings;
but as the &s;ober conclu&s;ion of a wi&s;e and
good man concerning the imperfection of
that happine&s;s which re&s;ts &s;olely on worldly
plea&s;ures. The&s;e, in their faire&s;t form, are
<PB N="180" REF="187">
not what they &s;eem to be. They never
be&s;tow that complete &s;atisfaction which they
promi&s;e; and therefore he who looks to
nothing beyond them &s;hall have frequent
cau&s;e to deplore their vanity.</P>
<P>Nothing is of higher importance to us as
men and as Chri&s;tians, than to form a proper
e&s;timate of human life, without either load|ing
it with imaginary evils, or expecting
from it greater advantages than it is able to
yield. It &s;hall be my bu&s;ine&s;s, therefore,
in this Di&s;cour&s;e, to di&s;tingui&s;h a ju&s;t and
religious &s;en&s;e of the vanity of the world
from the unrea&s;onable complaints of it which
we often hear. I &s;hall endeavour, I. To
&s;hew in what &s;en&s;e it is true that all earthly
plea&s;ures are vanity, II. To inquire how
this vanity of the world can be reconciled
with the perfections of its great Author.
III. To examine whether there are not
&s;ome real and &s;olid enjoyments in human
life which fall not under this general charge
of vanity. And, IV. To point out the
proper improvement to be made of &s;uch a
&s;tate as the life of man &s;hall appear on the
whole to be.</P>
<P><PB N="181" REF="188">
I. I AM to &s;hew in what &s;en&s;e it is true
that all human plea&s;ures are vanity. This
is a topic which might be embelli&s;hed with
the pomp of much de&s;cription. But I &s;hall
&s;tudiou&s;ly avoid exaggeration, and only
point out a threefold vanity in human life
which every impartial ob&s;erver cannot but
admit; di&s;appointment in pur&s;uit, di&s;&s;ati&s;|faction
in enjoyment, uncertainty in po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, di&s;appointment in pur&s;uit. When
we look around us on the world, we every
where behold a bu&s;y multitude, intent on
the pro&s;ecution of various de&s;igns which
their wants or de&s;ires have &s;ugge&s;ted. We
behold them employing every method which
ingenuity can devi&s;e, &s;ome the patience of
indu&s;try, &s;ome the boldne&s;s of enterpri&s;e,
others the dexterity of &s;tratagem, in order
to compa&s;s their ends. Of this ince&s;&s;ant &s;tir
and activity, what is the fruit? In compa|ri&s;on
of the crowd who have toiled in vain,
how &s;mall is the number of the &s;ucce&s;sful?
Or rather, where is the man who will de|clare
that in every point he has completed
<PB N="182" REF="189">
his plan, and attained his utmo&s;t wi&s;h? No
extent of human abilities has been able to
di&s;cover a path which, in any line of life,
leads unerringly to &s;ucce&s;s. <HI>The race is not
always to the &s;wift, nor the battle to the &s;trong,
nor riches to men of under&s;tanding.</HI> We may
form our plans with the mo&s;t profound &s;a|gacity,
and with the mo&s;t vigilant caution
may guard again&s;t dangers on every &s;ide.
But &s;ome unfore&s;een occurrence comes acro&s;s
which ha&s;&s;les our wi&s;dom, and lays our la|bours
in the du&s;t.</P>
<P>Were &s;uch di&s;appointments confined to
tho&s;e who a&s;pire at engro&s;&s;ing the higher
departments of life, the misfortune were
le&s;s. The humiliation of the mighty, and
the fall of ambition from its towering height,
little concern the hulk of mankind. The&s;e
are objects on which, as on di&s;tant meteors,
they gaze from afar, without drawing per|&s;onal
in&s;truction from events &s;o much above
them. But, alas! when we de&s;cend into
the regions of private life, we find di&s;ap|pointment
and bl$&s;$ed hope equally preva|lent
there. Neither the moderation of our
<PB N="183" REF="190">
views, nor the ju&s;tice of our preten&s;ions, can
en&s;ure &s;ucce&s;s. But <HI>time and chance happen
to all.</HI> Again&s;t the &s;tream of events both
the worthy and the unde&s;erving are obliged
to &s;truggle; and both are frequently over|born
alike by the current.</P>
<P>BESIDES di&s;appointment in pur&s;uit, di&s;|&s;atisfaction
in enjoyment is a farther vanity
to which the human &s;tate is &s;ubject. This
is the &s;evere&s;t of all mortifications, after
having been &s;ucce&s;sful in the pur&s;uit, to be
baffled in the enjoyment it&s;elf. Yet this is
found to be an evil &s;till more general than
the former. Some may be &s;o fortunate as
to attain what they have pur&s;ued; but none
are rendered completely happy by what they
have attained. Di&s;appointed hope is mi|&s;ery;
and yet &s;ucce&s;sful hope is only im|perfect
bli&s;s. Look through all the ranks
of mankind. Examine the condition of
tho&s;e who appear mo&s;t pro&s;perous; and you
will find that they are never ju&s;t what they
de&s;ire to be. If retired, they langui&s;h for
action; if bu&s;y, they complain of fatigue.
<PB N="184" REF="191">
If in middle life, they are impatient for di&s;|tinction;
if in high &s;tations, they &s;igh after
freedom and ea&s;e. Something is &s;till want|ing
to that plenitude of &s;atisfaction which
they expected to acquire. Together with
every with that is gratified, a new demand
ari&s;es. One void opens in the heart, as
another is filled. On wi&s;hes, wi&s;hes grow;
and to the end, it is rather the expectation
of what they have not, than the enjoyment
of what they have, which occupies and in|tere&s;ts
the mo&s;t &s;ucce&s;sful.</P>
<P>This di&s;&s;atisfaction in the mid&s;t of hu|man
plea&s;ure &s;prings partly from the nature
of our enjoyments them&s;elves, and partly
from circum&s;tances which corrupt them.
No worldly enjoyments are adequate to the
high de&s;ires and powers of an immortal &s;pi|rit.
Fancy paints them at a di&s;tance with
&s;plendid colours; but po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion unveils the
fallacy. The eagerne&s;s of pa&s;&s;ion be&s;tows
upon them at fir&s;t a bri&s;k and lively reli&s;h.
But it is their fate always to pall by fami|liarity,
and &s;ometimes to pa&s;s from &s;atiety
into di&s;gu&s;t. Happy would the poor man
<PB N="185" REF="192">
think him&s;elf if he could enter on all the
trea&s;ures of the rich; and happy for a &s;hort
while he might be. But before he had long
contemplated and admired his &s;tate, his po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ions
would &s;eem to le&s;&s;en, and his cares
would grow.</P>
<P>Add to the un&s;atisfying nature of our
plea&s;ures the attending circum&s;tances which
never fail to corrupt them. For, &s;uch as
they are, they are at no time po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed un|mixed.
To human lips it is not given to
ta&s;te the cup of pure joy. When external
circum&s;tances &s;how faire&s;t to the world, the
envied man groans in private under his own
burden. Some vexation di&s;quiets, &s;ome pa&s;|&s;ion
corrodes him; &s;ome di&s;tre&s;s, either felt
or feared, gnaws, like a worm, the root of
his felicity. When there is nothing from
without to di&s;turb the pro&s;perous, a &s;ecret
poi&s;on operates within. For worldly hap|pine&s;s
ever tends to de&s;troy it&s;elf, by cor|rupting
the heart. It fo&s;ters the loo&s;e and the
violent pa&s;&s;ions. It engenders noxious habits;
and taints the mind with a fal&s;e delicacy,
which makes it feel a thou&s;and unreal evils.</P>
<P><PB N="186" REF="193">
BUT put the ca&s;e in the mo&s;t favourable
light. Lay a&s;ide from human pleasures
both di&s;appointment in pur&s;uit, and deceit|fulne&s;s
in enjoyment; &s;uppo&s;e them to be
fully attainable, and completely &s;atisfactory;
&s;till there remains to be con&s;idered the va|nity
of uncertain po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion and &s;hort dura|tion.
Were there in worldly things any
fixed point of &s;ecurity which we could gain,
the mind would then have &s;ome ba&s;is on
which to re&s;t. But our condition is &s;uch,
that every thing wavers and totters around
us. <HI>Boa&s;t not thy&s;elf of to-morrow; for
thou knowe&s;t not what a day may bring forth.</HI>
It is much if, during its cour&s;e, thou heare&s;t
not of &s;ome what to di&s;quiet or alarm thee.
For life never proceeds long in an uniform
train. It is continually varied by unex|pected
events. The &s;eeds of alteration are
every where &s;own; and the &s;un&s;hine of
pro&s;perity commonly accelerates their
growth. If your enjoyments be numerous,
you lie more open on different &s;ides to be
wounded. If you have po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed them long,
you have greater cau&s;e to dread an ap|proaching
<PB N="187" REF="194">
change. By &s;low degrees pro|&s;perity
ri&s;es; but rapid is the progre&s;s of
evil. It requires no preparation to bring
it forward. The edifice which it co&s;t much
time and labour to erect, one inau&s;picious
event, one &s;udden blow, can level with the
du&s;t. Even &s;uppo&s;ing the accidents of life
to leave us untouched, human bli&s;s mu&s;t
&s;till be tran&s;itory; for man changes of him|&s;elf.
No cour&s;e of enjoyment can delight
us long. What amu&s;ed our youth Jo&s;es its
charm in maturer age. As years advance,
our powers are blunted, and our plea&s;urable
feelings decline. The &s;ilent lap&s;e of time
is ever carrying &s;omewhat from us, till at
length the period comes when all mu&s;t be
&s;wept away. The pro&s;pect of this termina|tion
of our labours and pur&s;uits is &s;ufficient
to mark our &s;tate with vanity. <HI>Our days
are a band-breadth, and our age is as no|thing.</HI>
Within that little &s;pace is all our
enterprise bounded. We crowd it with
toils and cares, with contention and &s;trife.
We project great de&s;igns, entertain high
hopes, and then leave our plans unfini&s;hed,
and &s;ink into oblivion.</P>
<P><PB N="188" REF="195">
This much let it &s;uffice to have &s;aid con|cerning
the vanity of the world. That
too much has not been &s;aid, mu&s;t appear
to every one who con&s;iders how generally
mankind lean to the oppo&s;ite &s;ide; and how
often by undue attachment to the pre&s;ent
&s;tate, they both feed the mo&s;t &s;inful pa&s;|&s;ions,
and <HI>pierce them&s;elves through with many
&s;orrows.</HI> Let us proceed to enquire,</P>
<P>II. How this Vanity of the world can he
reconciled with the perfections of its divine
Author. This enquiry involves that great
difficulty which has perplexed the thought|ful
and &s;erious in every age; If God be
good, whence the evil that fills the earth?
In an&s;wer to this intere&s;ting que&s;tion, let us
ob&s;erve,</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place, that the pre&s;ent condi|tion
of man was not his original or primary
&s;tate. We are informed by divine revela|tion,
that it is the con&s;equence of his volun|tary
apo&s;tacy from God and a &s;tate of inno|cence.
By this, his nature was corrupted;
his powers were enfeebled; and vanity and
<PB N="189" REF="196">
vexation introduced into his life. All na|ture
became involved in the condemnation
of man. The earth was cur&s;ed upon his
account, and the whole creation made to
<HI>groan and travail in pain.</HI></P>
<P>How my&s;terious &s;oever the account of
this fall may appear to us, many circum|&s;tances
concur to authenticate the fact, and
to &s;how that human nature and the human
&s;tate have undergone an unhappy change.
The belief of this has obtained in almo&s;t all
nations and religions. It can be traced
through all the fables of antiquity. An ob|&s;cure
tradition appears to have pervaded
the whole earth, that man is not now what
he was at fir&s;t; but that, in con&s;equence of
&s;ome tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion again&s;t his great Lord,
a &s;tate of degradation and exile &s;ucceeded
to a condition that was more flourishing and
happy. As our nature carries plain marks
of perver&s;ion and di&s;order, &s;o the world
which we inhabit bears the &s;ymptoms of
having been convul&s;ed in all its frame.
Naturali&s;ts point out to us every where the
traces of &s;ome violent change which it has
<PB N="190" REF="197">
&s;uffered. I&s;lands torn from the continent,
burning mountains, &s;hattered precipices, un|inhabitable
wa&s;tes, give it all the appearance
of a mighty ruin. The phy&s;ical and moral
&s;tate of man in this world mutually &s;ym|pathize
and corre&s;pond. They indicate not
a regular and orderly &s;tructure either of
matter or of mind, but the remains of &s;ome|what
that once was more fair and magnifi|cent.
Let us ob&s;erve,</P>
<P>IN the &s;econd place, that as this was not
the original, &s;o it is not intended to be the
final &s;tate of man. Though in con&s;e|quence
of the abu&s;e of the human powers, &s;in
and vanity were introduced into this region
of the univer&s;e, it was not the purpo&s;e of
the Creator that they &s;hould be permitted
to reign for ever. He hath made ample
provi&s;ion for the recovery of the penitent
and faithful part of his &s;ubjects, by the
merciful undertaking of that great re&s;torer
of the world, our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t. By
him <HI>life and immortality were</HI> both purcha&s;|ed
and <HI>brought to light. The new heavens
<PB N="191" REF="198">
and the new earth</HI> are di&s;covered, <HI>wherein
dwelleth righteou&s;ne&s;s;</HI> where, through the
divine grace, human nature &s;hall regain its
original honours, and man &s;hall return to
be what once he was in Paradi&s;e. Through
tho&s;e high di&s;coveries of the Go&s;pel, this
life appears to good men only in the light
of an intermediate and preparatory &s;tate.
Its vanity and mi&s;ery, in a manner, di&s;ap|pear.
They have every rea&s;on to &s;ubmit
without complaint to its laws, and to wait
in patience till the appointed time come for
<HI>the re&s;titution of all things.</HI> Let us take no|tice</P>
<P>IN the third place, that, a future &s;tate
being made known, we can account in a
&s;atisfying manner for the pre&s;ent di&s;tre&s;s of
human life, without the &s;malle&s;t impeach|ment
of divine goodne&s;s. The &s;ufferings
we here undergo are converted into di&s;ci|pline
and improvement Through the
ble&s;&s;ing of Heaven, good is extracted from
apparent evil; and the very mi&s;ery which
originated from &s;in is rendered the means
<PB N="192" REF="199">
of correcting &s;inful pa&s;&s;ions, and preparing
us for felicity. There is much rea&s;on to
believe that creatures as imperfect as we
are, require &s;ome &s;uch preliminary &s;tate of
experience before they can recover the per|fection
of their nature. It is in the mid&s;t
of di&s;appointments and trials that we learn
the in&s;ufficiency of temporal things to hap|pine&s;s,
and are taught to &s;eek it from God
and Virtue. By the&s;e the violence of our
pa&s;&s;ions is tamed, and our minds are form|ed
to &s;obriety and reflection. In the varie|ties
of life, occa&s;ioned by the vici&s;&s;itude of
worldly fortune, we are inured to habits
both of the active and the &s;uffering virtues.
How much &s;oever we complain of the va|nity
of the world, facts plainly &s;how, that
if its vanity were le&s;s, it could not an&s;wer
the purpo&s;e of &s;alutary di&s;cipline. Un&s;a|tisfactory
as it is, its plea&s;ures are &s;till too
apt to corrupt our hearts. How fatal then
mu&s;t the con&s;equences have been, had it
yielded us more complete enjoyment? If,
with all its troubles, we are in danger of
being too much attached to it, how entirely
<PB N="193" REF="200">
would it have &s;educed our affections, if no
troubles had been mingled with its plea|&s;ures?</P>
<P>The&s;e ob&s;ervations &s;erve in a great mea|&s;ure
to obviate the difficulties which ari&s;e
from the apparent vanity of the human
&s;tate, by &s;howing how, upon the Chri&s;tian
&s;y&s;tem, that vanity may be reconciled with
the infinite goodne&s;s of the Sovereign of the
Univer&s;e. The pre&s;ent condition of man
is not that for which he was originally de|&s;igned;
it is not to be his final &s;tate; and
during his pa&s;&s;age through the world, the
di&s;tre&s;&s;es which he undergoes are rendered
medicinal and improving. After having
taken this view of things, the cloud which,
in the preceding part of the di&s;cour&s;e, ap|peared
to &s;it &s;o thick upon human life be|gins
to be di&s;&s;ipated. We now perceive that
man is not abandoned by his Creator. We
di&s;cern great and good de&s;igns going on in
his behalf. We are allowed to entertain
better hopes; and are encouraged to en|quire,
as was propo&s;ed for the
<PB N="194" REF="201">
III. HEAD of di&s;cour&s;e, Whether there
be not in the pre&s;ent condition of human
life &s;ome real and &s;olid enjoyments which
come not under the general charge of <HI>vanity
of vanities.</HI> The doctrine of the text is to
be con&s;idered as chiefly addre&s;&s;ed to worldly
men. Them Solomon means to teach that
all expectations of bli&s;s which re&s;t &s;olely on
earthly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions and plea&s;ures, &s;hall end
in di&s;appointment. But &s;urely he did not
intend to a&s;&s;ert that there is no material
difference in the pur&s;uits of men, or that
no real happine&s;s of any kind could now be
attained by the virtuous. For be&s;ides the
unan&s;werable objection which this would
form again&s;t the divine admini&s;tration, it
would directly contradict what he el&s;ewhere
a&s;&s;erts, that while <HI>God giveth &s;ore travail to
the &s;inner, he giveth to the man that is good
in his &s;ight wi&s;dom, and knowledge, and joy</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Eccle&s;. ii. 26.</NOTE>
It may, it mu&s;t indeed be admitted, that
unmixed and complete happine&s;s is un|known
on earth. No regulation of con|duct
can altogether prevent pa&s;&s;ions from
<PB N="195" REF="202">
di&s;turbing our peace, and misfortunes from
wounding our heart. But after this con|ce&s;&s;ion
is made, will it follow that there is
no object on earth which de&s;erves our
pur&s;uit, or that all enjoyment becomes
contemptible which is not perfect? Let
us &s;urvey our &s;tate with an impartial
eye, and be ju&s;t to the various gifts of
Heaven. How vain &s;oever this life, con|&s;idered
in it&s;elf, may be, the comforts
and hopes of religion are &s;ufficient to give
&s;olidity to the enjoyments of the righ|teous.
In the exerci&s;e of good affections,
and the te&s;timony of an upright con&s;cience;
in the &s;en&s;e of peace and reconciliation with
God through the great Redeemer of Man|kind;
in the firm confidence of being con|ducted
through all the trials of life by infi|nite
wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s; and in the joyjul
pro&s;pect of arriving in the end at immortal
felicity, they po&s;&s;e&s;s a happine&s;s which,
de&s;cending from a purer and more perfect
region that this world, partakes not of its
vanity.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the enjoyments peculiar to reli|gion,
there are other plea&s;ures of our pre|&s;ent
<PB N="196" REF="203">
&s;ent &s;tate which, though of an inferiour
order, mu&s;t not be overlooked in the e&s;ti|mate
of human life. It is nece&s;&s;ary to call
attention to the&s;e, in order to check that
repining and unthankful &s;pirit to which
man is always too prone. Some degree of
importance mu&s;t be allowed to the com|forts
of health, to the innocent gratifications
of &s;en&s;e, and to the entertainment afforded
us by all the beautiful &s;cenes of nature;
&s;ome to the pur&s;uits and amu&s;ements of
&s;ocial life; and more to the internal enjoy|ments
of thought and reflexion, and to the
plea&s;ures of affectionate intercour&s;e with
tho&s;e whom we love. The&s;e comforts are
often held in too low e&s;timation, merely
becau&s;e they are ordinary and common;
although that be the circum&s;tance which
ought, in rea&s;on, to enhance their value.
They lie open, in &s;ome degree, to all; ex|tend
through every rank of life, and fill up
agreeably many of tho&s;e &s;paces in our pre|&s;ent
exi&s;tence, which are not occupied with
higher objects, or with &s;erious cares.</P>
<P>We are in &s;everal re&s;pects unju&s;t to Pro|vidence
in the computation of our plea&s;ures
<PB N="197" REF="204">
and our pains. We number the hours
which are &s;pent in di&s;tre&s;s or &s;orrow; but
we forget tho&s;e which have pa&s;&s;ed away, if
not in high enjoyment, yet in the mid&s;t of
tho&s;e gentle &s;atisfactions, and placid emo|tions,
which make life glide &s;moothly along.
We complain of the frequent di&s;appoint|ments
which we &s;uffer in our pur&s;uits. But
we recollect not that it is in pur&s;uit, more
than in attainment, that our plea&s;ure now
con&s;i&s;ts. In the pre&s;ent &s;tate of human na|ture,
man derives more enjoyment from the
exertion of his active powers in the mid&s;t of
toils and efforts, than he could receive from
a &s;till and uniform po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the object
which he &s;trives to gain. The &s;olace of the
mind under all its labours, is hope; and
there are few &s;ituations which entirely ex|clued
it. Forms of expected bli&s;s are often
gleaming upon us through a cloud, to re|vive
and exhilarate the mo&s;t di&s;tre&s;&s;ed. If
pains be &s;cattered through all the conditions
of life, &s;o al&s;o are plea&s;ures. Happine&s;s,
as far as life affords it, can be engro&s;&s;ed by no
rank of men to the exclu&s;ion of the re&s;t; on
<PB N="198" REF="205">
the contrary, it is often found where, at
fir&s;t view, it would have been lea&s;t expect|ed.
When the human condition appears
mo&s;t depre&s;&s;ed, the feelings of men, through
the gracious appointment of Providence,
adju&s;t them&s;elves wonderfully to their &s;tate,
and enable them to extract &s;atisfaction from
&s;ources that are totally unknown to others.
Were the great body of men fairly to com|pute
the hours which they pa&s;s in ea&s;e, and
even with &s;ome degree of plea&s;ure, they
would be found far to exceed the number
of tho&s;e which are &s;pent in ab&s;olute pain
either of body or mind.&mdash;But in order to
make a &s;till more accurate e&s;timation of
the degree of &s;atisfaction which, in the mid&s;t
of earthly vanity, man is permitted to enjoy,
the three following ob&s;ervations claim our
attention,</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t is, that many of the evils which
occa&s;ion our complaints of the world are
wholly imaginary. They derive their ex|i&s;tence
from fancy and humour, and child|i&s;h
&s;ubjection to the opinions of others.
<PB N="199" REF="206">
The di&s;tre&s;s which they produce, I admit,
is real; but its reality ari&s;es not from the
nature of things, but from that di&s;order of
imagination which a &s;mall mea&s;ure of re|flection
might rectify. In proof of this we
may ob&s;erve, that the per&s;ons who live mo&s;t
&s;imply, and follow the dictates of plain un|adulterated
nature, are mo&s;t exempted from
this cla&s;s of evils. It is among the higher
ranks of mankind that they chiefly abound;
where fanta&s;tic re&s;inements, &s;ickly delicacy,
and eager emulation, open a thou&s;and
&s;ources of vexation peculiar to them&s;elves.
Life cannot but prove vain to them who
affect a di&s;reli&s;h of every plea&s;ure that is
not both exqui&s;ite and new; who mea&s;ure
enjoyment, not by their own feelings, but
by the &s;tandard of fa&s;hion; who think
them&s;elves mi&s;erable if others do not ad|mire
their &s;tate. It is not from wants or
&s;orrows that their complaints ari&s;e; but,
though it may appear a paradox, from too
much freedom from &s;orrow and want; from
the languor of vacant life, and the irritation
occa&s;ioned by tho&s;e &s;tagnating humours
<PB N="200" REF="207">
which ea&s;e and indulgence have bred within
them. In their ca&s;e, therefore, it is not the
vanity of the world, but the vanity of their
minds, which is to be accu&s;ed. Fancy has
rai&s;ed up the &s;pectres which haunt them.
Fancy has formed the cloud which hangs
over their life. Did they allow the light
of rea&s;on to break forth, the &s;pectres would
vani&s;h, and the cloud be di&s;pelled.</P>
<P>THE &s;econd ob&s;ervation on this head is,
that of tho&s;e evils which may be called real,
becau&s;e they owe not their exi&s;tence to
fancy, nor can be removed by rectifying
opinion, a great proportion is brought upon
us by our own mi&s;conduct. Di&s;ea&s;es, po|verty,
di&s;appointment and &s;hame are far
from being, in every in&s;tance, the unavoid|able
doom of men. They are much more
frequently the offspring of their own mi&s;|guided
choice. Intemperance engenders
di&s;ea&s;e, &s;loth produces poverty, pride cre|ates
di&s;appointments, and di&s;hone&s;ty expo&s;es
to &s;$ame. The ungoverned pa&s;&s;ions of men
betray them into a thou&s;and follies; their
<PB N="201" REF="208">
follies into crimes; and their crimes into
misfortunes. Yet nothing is more com|mon
than for &s;uch as have been the authors
of their own mi&s;ery, to make loud com|plaints
of the hard fate of man, and to take
revenge upon the human condition by ar|raigning
its &s;uppo&s;ed vanity. <HI>The fooli&s;h|ne&s;s
of man fir&s;t perverteth his way, and then
his heart fretteth again&s;t the Lord.</HI></P>
<P>I do not, however, maintain that it is
within our power to be altogether free of
tho&s;e &s;elf-procured evils. For perfection of
any kind is beyond the reach of man.
Where is the wi&s;dom that never errs?
Where the ju&s;t man that offendeth not?
Neverthele&s;s, much is here left to our|&s;elves;
and, imperfect as we are, the con|&s;equences
of right or of wrong conduct
make a wide difference in the happine&s;s of
men. Experience every day &s;hows that a
&s;ound, a well-governed, and virtuous mind
contributes greatly to &s;mooth the path of
life; and that <HI>wi&s;dom excelleth folly as far
as light excelleth darkne&s;s. The way of the
wicked is as darkne&s;s; they know not at what
<PB N="202" REF="209">
they &s;tumble. But the righteou&s;ne&s;s of the
perfect &s;hall direct his way; and he that
walketh uprightly, walketh &s;urely.</HI> The
tendency of the one is towards a plain and
&s;afe region. The cour&s;e of the other leads
him amid&s;t &s;nares and precipices. The one
occa&s;ionally may, the other unavoidably
mu&s;t, incur much trouble. Let us not
then confound, under one general charge,
tho&s;e evils of the world which belong to the
lot of humanity, and tho&s;e which, through
divine a&s;&s;i&s;tance, a wi&s;e and good man may,
in a great mea&s;ure, e&s;cape.</P>
<P>THE third ob&s;ervation which I make re|&s;pects
tho&s;e evils which are both real and
unavoidable; from which neither wi&s;dom
nor goodne&s;s can procure our exemption.
Under the&s;e this comfort remains, that if
they cannot be prevented, there are means,
however, by which they may be much al|leviated.
Religion is the great principle
which acts, under &s;uch circum&s;tances, as the
corrective of human vanity. It in&s;pires
fortitude, &s;upports patience, and by its
<PB N="203" REF="210">
pro&s;pects and promi&s;es darts a cheering ray
into the darke&s;t &s;hade of human life. If it
cannot &s;ecure the virtuous from di&s;appoint|ment
in their pur&s;uits, it forms them to &s;uch
a temper as renders their di&s;appointments
more light and ea&s;y than tho&s;e of other men.
If it does not bani&s;h di&s;&s;atisfaction from
their worldly plea&s;ures, it confers &s;piritual
plea&s;ures in their &s;tead. If it en&s;$res them
not the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of what they love, it fur|ni&s;hes
comfort under the lo&s;s. As far as it
e&s;tabli&s;hes a contented frame of mind, it
&s;upplies the want of all that worldly men
covet to po&s;&s;e&s;s. Compare the behaviour
of the &s;en&s;ual and corrupted with that of the
upright and holy, when both are feeling the
effects of human vanity, and the difference
of their &s;ituation will be manife&s;t. Among
the former you are likely to find a querulous
and dejected, among the latter, a compo&s;ed
and manly &s;pirit. The lamentations of the
one excite a mixture of pity and contempt;
while the dignity which the other maintain
in di&s;tre&s;s commands re&s;pect. The &s;uffer|ings
of the former &s;ettle into a peevi&s;h and
<PB N="204" REF="211">
fretful di&s;po&s;ition; tho&s;e of the latter &s;often
the temper and improve the heart. The&s;e
con&s;equences extend &s;o far as to give ground
for a&s;&s;erting, that a good man enjoys more
happine&s;s in the cour&s;e of a &s;eemingly un|pro&s;perous
life, than a bad man does in the
mid&s;t of affluence and luxury. What a
con&s;picuous proof of this is afforded by the
Apo&s;tle Paul, who from the very depth of
affliction could &s;end forth &s;uch a triumphant
voice as proclaims the complete victory
which he had gained over the evils of life?
<HI>Troubled on every &s;ide, yet not di&s;tre&s;&s;ed;
perplexed, but not in de&s;pair; per&s;ecuted, but
not for&s;aken; ca&s;t down, but not de&s;troyed.
For though our outward man peri&s;h, our in|ward
man is renewed, day by day</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">2 Corinth. iv. 8, 9. 16.</NOTE> Such,
though perhaps in an inferior degree, will
be the influence of a genuine religious prin|ciple
upon all true Chri&s;tians. It begins to
perform that office to them here, which here|after
it will more completely di&s;charge, of
<HI>wiping away the tears from their eyes.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="205" REF="212">
Such, upon the whole, is the e&s;timate
which we are to from of human life. Much
vanity will always belong to it; though the
degree of its vanity will depend, in a great
mea&s;ure, on our own character and con|duct.
To the vicious, it pre&s;ents nothing
but a continued &s;cene of di&s;appointment and
di&s;&s;atisfaction. To the good, it is a mixed
&s;tate of thing$; where many real comforts
may be enjoyed; where many re&s;ources
under trouble may be obtained; but where
trouble, in one form or other, is to be ex|pected
as the lot of man. From this view
of human life.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t practical conclu&s;ion which we
are to draw is, that it highly concerns us
not to he unrea&s;onable in our expectations
of worldly felicity. Let us always remem|ber
where we are; from what cau&s;es the
human &s;tate has become &s;ubject to depre&s;|&s;ion;
and upon what accounts it mu&s;t re|main
under its pre&s;ent law. Such is the
infatuation of &s;elf-love, that though in the
general doctrine of the vanity of the world
<PB N="206" REF="213">
all men agree, yet almo&s;t every one flatters
him&s;elf that his own ca&s;e is to be an excep|tion
from the common rule. He re&s;ts on
expectations which he thinks can not fail
him; and though the pre&s;ent b$ not altoge|ther
according to his wi&s;h, yet with the
confidence of certain hope he anticipates
futurity. Hence the angui&s;h of di&s;appoint|ment
&s;ills the world; and evils, which are
of them&s;elves &s;ufficiently &s;evere, opppre&s;s with
double force the unprepared and un&s;u&s;pect|ing
mind. Nothing therefore is of greater
con&s;equence to our peace, than to have al|ways
before our eyes &s;uch views or the
world as &s;hall prevent our expecting more
from it than it is de&s;tined to afford. We
de&s;troy our joys by devouring them before|hand
with too eager expectation. We ruin
the happine&s;s of life when we attempt to
rai&s;e it too high. A tolerable and comfort|able
&s;tate is all that we can propo&s;e to our|&s;elves
on earth. Peace and contentment,
not bli&s;s nor tran&s;port, is the full portion of
man. Perfect joy is re&s;erved for heaven.</P>
<P><PB N="207" REF="214">
But while we repre&s;s too &s;anguine hopes
formed upon human life, let us, in the &s;e|cond
place, guard again&s;t the other extreme
of repining and di&s;content. Enough has
been already &s;aid to &s;hew, that notwith|&s;tanding
the vanity of the world, a con&s;i|derable
degree of comfort is attainable in the
Pre&s;ent &s;tate. Let the recollection of this
&s;erve to reconcile us to our condition, and
to check the arrogance of complaints and
murmur.&mdash;What art thou, O &s;on of man!
who having &s;prung but ye&s;terday out of the
du&s;t, dare&s;t to lift up they voice again&s;t thy
Maker, and to arraign his providcence, be|cau&s;e
all things are not ordered according
to they wi&s;h? What title ha&s;t thou to find
fault with the order of the univer&s;e, who&s;e
lot is &s;o much beyond what thy virtue or
merit gave thee ground to claim? Is is no|thing
to thee to have been introduced into
this magnificent world; to have been ad|mitted
as a &s;pectator of the divine wi&s;dom
and works; and to have had acce&s;s to all
the comforts which nature, with a bountiful
hand, has poured forth around thee? Are
<PB N="208" REF="215">
all the hours forgotten which thou ha&s;t pa&s;&s;ed
in ea&s;e, in complacency, or joy? Is it a
&s;mall favour in thy eyes, that the hand of
divine mercy has been &s;tretched forth to aid
thee, and, if thou reject not its proffered
a&s;&s;i&s;tance, is ready to conduct thee into a
happier &s;tate of exi&s;tence? When thou com|pare&s;t
thy condition with thy de&s;ert, blu&s;h,
and be a&s;hamed of they complaints. Be &s;ilent,
be grateful, and adore. Receive with thank|fulne&s;s
the ble&s;&s;ings which are allowewd thee.
Revere that government which at pre&s;ent
refu&s;es thee more. Re&s;t in this conclu&s;ion,
that though there be evils in the world, its
Creator is wi&s;e and good, and has been
bountiful to thee.</P>
<P>In the third place, the view which we
have taken of human life &s;hould naturally
direct us to &s;uch pur&s;uits as may have mo&s;t
influence for correcting its vanity. There
are tow great lines of conduct which offer
them&s;elves to our choice. The one leads
towards the goods of the mind; the other
towards tho&s;e of fortune. The former,
<PB N="209" REF="216">
which is adopted only by the few, engages
us chiefly in forming our principles, regu|lating
our di&s;po&s;itions, improving all our
inward powers. The latter, which in every
age has been followed by the multitude,
points at no other end but attaining the
conveniencies and plea&s;ures of external life.
It is obvious that, in this la&s;t pur&s;uit, the
vanity of the world will encounter us at
every &s;tep. For this is the region in which
it reigns, and where it chiefly di&s;plays its
power. At the &s;ame time, to lay the world
totally out of view is a vain attempt. The
numberle&s;s ties by which we are connected
with external things, put it out of our power
to behold them with indifference. But
though we cannot wrap our&s;elves up en|tirely
in the care of the mind, yet the more
we make its welfare our chief object, the
nearer &s;hall we approach to that happy in|dependence
on the world which places us
beyond the reach of &s;uffering from its
vanity.</P>
<P>That di&s;cipline, therefore, which corrects
the eagerne&s;s of worldly pa&s;&s;ions, which
<PB N="210" REF="217">
forti&s;ies the heart with virtuous principles,
which enlightens the mind with u&s;eful
knowledge, and furni&s;he; to it matter of
enjoyment from within it&s;elf, is of more
con&s;equence to real felicity, than all the pro|vi&s;ion
which we can make of the goods of
fortune. To this let us bend our chief at|tention.
Let us <HI>keep the heart with all di|ligence,
&s;eeing out of it are the i&s;&s;ues of life.</HI>
Let us account our mind the mo&s;t important
province which is committed to our care;
and if we cannot rule fortune, &s;tudy at lea&s;t
to rule our&s;elves. Let us propo&s;e for our
object, not worldy &s;ucce&s;s, which it de|pends
not on us to obtain; but that upright
and honourable di&s;charge of our duty in
every conjuncture, which, though the di|vine
a&s;&s;i&s;tance, is always within our power.
Let our happine&s;s be &s;ought where our pro|per
prai&s;e is found; and that be accounted
our only real evil, which is the evil of our
nature; not that, which is either the ap|pointment
of Providence, or which ari&s;es
from the evil of others.</P>
<P><PB N="211" REF="218">
But in order to carry on with &s;ucce&s;s
this rational and manly plan of conduct, it
is nece&s;&s;ary, in the la&s;t place, that to moral,
we join religious di&s;cipline, Under the
pre&s;ent imperfection of our minds, and
amid&s;t the frequent &s;hocks which we receive
from human evils, much do we &s;tand in
need of every a&s;&s;i&s;tance for &s;upporting our
con&s;tancy. Of all a&s;&s;i&s;tance to which we
can have recour&s;e, none is &s;o powerful as
what may be derived from the principles of
the Chri&s;tian faith. He who builds on any
other foundation will find, in the day of
trial, that he had built his hou&s;e on the &s;and.
Man is formed by his nature to look up to
a &s;uperiour Being, and to lean upon a &s;trength
that is greater that his own. All the con|fiderations
which we can offer for confirm|ing
his mind, pre&s;uppo&s;e this re&s;ource, and
derive from it their principal efficacy.</P>
<P>Never then let us lo&s;e &s;ight of tho&s;e great
objects which religion brings under our
view, if we hope to &s;tand firm and erect
amid&s;t the dangers and di&s;tre&s;&s;es of our pre|&s;ent
&s;tate. Let us cultivate all that con|nection
<PB N="212" REF="219">
with the great Father of Spirits
which our condition admits; by piety and
prayer; by dependence on his aid, and tru&s;t
in his promi&s;es; by a devout &s;en&s;e of his
pre&s;ence, and a continual endeavour to ac|quire
his grace and favour. Let us, with
humble faith and reverence, commit our|&s;elves
to the ble&s;&s;ed Redeemer of the world;
encouraged by the di&s;coveries which he has
made to us of the divine mercy, and by the
hopes which he has afforded us of being
rai&s;ed to a nobler and happier &s;tation in the
kingdom of God. So &s;hall virtue, grounded
upon piety, attain its full &s;trength. In&s;pired
with a religious &s;pirit, and guided by ra|tional
principles, we &s;hall be enabled to
hold a &s;teady cour&s;e through this mixed
region of plea&s;ure and pain, of hopes and
fears; until the period arrive when that
cloud which the pre&s;ent vanity of the world
throws over human affairs &s;hall entirely di&s;|appear,
and eternal light be diffu&s;ed over all
the works and ways of God.</P>

<P>This P&s;alm exhibits the plea&s;ing pic|ture
of a pious man rejoicing in the
goodne&s;s of Heaven.<NOTE PLACE="marg">SERM. VIII.</NOTE> He looks around him
on his &s;tate, and his heart overflows with
gratitude. when he reviews the pa&s;t part
of his life, he contemplates God as his
<HI>&s;hepherd who bath made him lie down in
green pa&s;tures, and led him be&s;ide the &s;till

<PB N="214" REF="221">

the &s;ame goodne&s;s, as continuing to <HI>follow
him all the days of his life, and bringing him
to dwell in the hou&s;e of the Lord for over.</HI>
Amid&s;t the&s;e images of tranquillity and hap|pine&s;s,
one object pre&s;ents it&s;elf, which is
&s;ufficient to overea&s;t the minds and to damp
the joy of the greate&s;t part of men; that is,
the approach of death. But on the P&s;almi&s;t
it produced no &s;uch effect. With perfect
compo&s;ure and &s;erenity he looks forward to
the time when he is to pa&s;s through <HI>the val|ley
of the &s;hadow of death.</HI> The pro&s;pect,
in&s;tead of dejecting him, appears to heighten
his triumph, by that &s;ecurity which the pre|&s;ence
of his almighty guardian afforded him.
<HI>I will fear no evil, for thou art with me:</HI>
and pur&s;uing the allu&s;ion with which he
had begun, exults in the hope that the &s;hep|herd
who had hitherto conducted him would
&s;upport him with his <HI>&s;taff,</HI> while he pa&s;&s;ed
through that dark and perilous region, and
<PB N="215" REF="222">
with his <HI>rod,</HI> or pa&s;toral crook, would guard
him from every danger.</P>
<P>Such is the happy diftinction which
good men enjoy, in a &s;ituation the mo&s;t
formidable to human nature. That threat|ening
&s;pectre which appalls others, carries
no terrour to them. While worldly men
are ju&s;tly &s;aid <HI>through fear of death to be
all their life-time subject to bondage,</HI> to the
righteous only it belongs to look on death,
and &s;mile. Since then it is in the power
of religion to confer upon us &s;o high a
privilege, let us adventure to contemplate
&s;teadily this la&s;t foe whom we mu&s;t all en|counter.
Let us con&s;ider what death is in
it&s;elf, and by what means good men are
enabled to meet it with fortitude. Though
the &s;ubject may be reckoned gloomy, it
mu&s;t be admitted to be intere&s;ting. The
clo&s;e of life is a &s;olemn and important
event, to which every wi&s;e man will have
regard in the general tenour of his conduct.
No one can act his part with propriety,
who con&s;iders not how it is to terminate;
and to exclude form our thoughts what we
<PB N="216" REF="223">
cannot prevent form actually taking place,
is the refuge of none but the timorous and
weak. We are more encouraged to enter
on this meditation by reflecting on the &s;u|periour
advantages which, as Chri&s;tians,
we enjoy for overcoming the fear of death,
beyond that holy man who&s;e &s;entiment is
now before us. Tho&s;e great objects, which
he beheld through the medium of types
and figures, are clearly revealed to us. That
di&s;pen&s;ation of greace, which in his days
began to open, is now completed. That
life and immortality, which then only dawn|ed
on the world, have now &s;hone forth
with full light and &s;plendour.</P>
<P>DEATH may be con&s;idered in three
views; as the &s;eparation of the &s;oul from
the body; as the conclu&s;ion of the pre&s;ent
life; as the entrance into a new &s;tate of
exi&s;tence. In the fir&s;t view, it is regarded
as painful and agonizing. In the &s;econd,
it is melancholy and dejecting. In the
third, it is awful and alarming. One of the
fir&s;t enquiries which occurs concerning it is,
<PB N="217" REF="224">
for what purpo&s;es it was clothed with all
the&s;e terrours? Why, under the govern|ment
of a gracious Being, the termination
of life was loaded with &s;o much &s;orrow and
di&s;tre&s;s? We know that, in con&s;equence of
the fall, death was inflicted as puni&s;hment
upon the human race. But no unnece&s;&s;ary
&s;everities are ever exerci&s;ed by God; and
the wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s of the divine plan
will be much illu&s;trated, by ob&s;erving that
all the formidable circum&s;tances which at|tend
death are, in the pre&s;ent &s;ituation of
mankind, ab&s;olutely requi&s;ite to the pro|per
government of the world. The ter|rours
of death are, in fact, the great guar|dians
of life. They excite in every indivi|dual
that de&s;ire of &s;elf-pre&s;ervation, which
is nature's fir&s;t law. They reconcile him
to bearing the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of life with patience.
They prompt him to undergo its u&s;eful
and nece&s;&s;ary labours with alacrity; and
they re&s;train him from many of tho&s;e evil
cour&s;es by which his &s;afety would be en|dangered.
While they are in &s;o many re|&s;pects
beneficial to the individual, they are
<PB N="218" REF="225">
at the &s;ame time, the &s;afeguard of &s;ociety.
If death were not dreaded and abhorred as
it is by men, no public order could be pre|&s;erved
in the world. The &s;word of autho|rity
were lifted up in vain. The fanctions
of law would lo&s;e their effect. The &s;caf|fold
and the executioner would be derided;
and the violent le&s;t to trample unre&s;trained
on the rights of the peaceful. If, notwith|&s;tanding
the re&s;traints which &s;elf-pre&s;erva|tion
impo&s;es, &s;ociety is &s;o often di&s;turbed
by the crimes of the wicked, what a &s;cene
of confu&s;ion would it become, if capital
puni&s;hments, which are the la&s;t re&s;ource
of governments, were of no influence to
deter offenders?</P>
<P>For &s;uch important ends the conclu&s;ion
of life has, by the appointment of Provi|dence,
been made an awful object. The
valley of death has been planted with ter|rours
to the apprehen&s;ion of men. Here,
as in many other in&s;tances, what &s;eemed
at fir&s;t to arraign the goodne&s;s of the Deity,
is upon enquiry found to con&s;irm it. But
though, for the mo&s;t &s;alutary purpo&s;es, it
<PB N="219" REF="226">
was requi&s;ite that the fear of death &s;hould
be a powerful principle in human nature,
yet, like our other propen&s;ities, it is apt,
when left to it&s;elf, to run into exce&s;s. Over
many it u&s;urps &s;uch an a&s;cendant as to de|ba&s;e
their character, and to defeat the
chief ends of livings. To pre&s;erve it within
&s;uch bounds that it &s;hall not interrupt us in
performing the proper offices and duties
of life, is the di&s;tinction of the brave man
above the coward; and to &s;urmount it in
&s;uch a degree that it &s;hall not, even in near
pro&s;pect, deject our &s;pirit, or trouble our
peace, is the great preference which virture
enjoys above guilt. It has been the &s;tudy
of the wi&s;e and reflecting, in every age, to
attain this &s;teadine&s;s of mind. Philo&s;ophy
pur&s;ued it as its chief object; and profe&s;&s;ed
that the great end of its di&s;cipline was, to
enable its votaries to conquer the fear of
death. Let us then, before we have re|cour&s;e
to the more powerful aid of religion,
hearken for a little to what rea&s;on has &s;ug|ge&s;ted
on this &s;ubject. Her a&s;&s;i&s;tance may,
perhaps, be not entirely de&s;picable; and
<PB N="220" REF="227">
though the armour which &s;he offers be not
completely of proof, it may &s;erve, how|ever,
to turn a&s;ide, or to blunt &s;ome of
the &s;hafts which are aimed again&s;t us by
the la&s;t foe.</P>
<P>AFTER this manner &s;he may be &s;uppo&s;ed
to addre&s;s mankind, in order to reconcile
them to their fate.&mdash;Children of man!
it is well known to you that you are a
mortal race. Death is the law of your
nature, the tribute of your being, the debt
which all are bound to pay. On the&s;e
terms you received life, that you &s;hould be
ready to give it up when Providence calls
you to make room for other, who in like
manner, when their time is come, &s;hall
follow you. He who is unwilling to &s;ub|mit
to death when heaven decrees it, de|&s;erves
not to have lived. You might as
rea&s;onably complain that you did not live
before the time appointed for your coming
into the world, as lament that you are not
to live longer when the period of your
quitting it is arrived. What divine Provi|dence
<PB N="221" REF="228">
hath made nece&s;&s;ary, human pru|dence
ought to comply with cheerfully.
Submit at any rate you mu&s;t; and is it not
much better to follow of your own accord,
than to be dragged reluctantly, and by
force? What privilege have you to plead,
or what rea&s;on to urge, why you &s;hould
po&s;&s;e&s;s an exemption from the common
doom? All things around you are mortal
and peri&s;hing. Cities, &s;tates, and empires
have their period &s;et. The proude&s;t monu|ments
of human art moulder into du&s;t.
Even the works of nature wax old and
decay. In the mid&s;t of this univer&s;al ten|dency
to change, could you expect that to
your frame alone a permanent duration
&s;hould be given? All who have gone be|fore
you have &s;ubmitted to the &s;troke of
death. All who are to come after you
&s;hall undergo the &s;ame fate. The great
and the good, the prince and the pea&s;ant,
the renowned and the ob&s;cure, travel alike
the road which leads to the grave. At the
moment when you expire, thou&s;ands
throughout the world &s;hall, together with
<PB N="222" REF="229">
you, be yielding up their breath. Can
that be held a great calamity which is com|mon
to you with every thing that lives on
earth; which is an event as much accord|ing
to the cour&s;e of nature as it is that
leaves &s;hould fall in autumn, or that fruit
&s;hould drop from the tree when it is fully
ripe?</P>
<P>The pain of death cannot be very long,
and is probably le&s;s &s;e$ere than what you
have at other times experienced. The pomp
of death is more terr$$$ing than death it&s;elf.
It is to the weakne&s;s: $word$gination that it
owes its chief power of $word$ting your &s;pi|rits;
for when the force of the mind is
rouzed, there is almo&s;t no pa&s;&s;ion in our
nature but what has &s;howed it&s;elf able to
overcome the fear of death. Honour has
defied death; love has de&s;pi&s;ed it; &s;hame
has ru&s;hed upon it; revenge has di&s;regarded
it; grief a thou&s;and times has wi&s;hed for it.
Is it not &s;trange that rea&s;on and virtue can|not
give you &s;trength to &s;urmount that fear,
which, even in feeble minds, &s;o many pa&s;|&s;ions
have conquered? What incon&s;i&s;tency
<PB N="223" REF="230">
is there in complaining &s;o much of the evils
of life, and being at the &s;ame time &s;o afraid
$f what is to terminate them all? Who can
tell whether his future life might not teem
with di&s;a&s;ters and mi&s;eries, as yet unknown,
were it to be prolonged according to his
wi&s;h? At any rate, is it de&s;ireable to draw
life out to the la&s;t dregs, and to wait till old
age pour upon you its whole &s;tore of di&s;ea&s;es
and &s;orrows? You lament that you are to
die; but did you view your &s;ituration pro|perly,
you would have much greater cau&s;e
to lament if you were chained to this life
for two or three hundred years, without
po&s;&s;ibility of relea&s;e. Expect therefore
calmly that which is natural in it&s;elf, and
which mu&s;t be $word$, becau&s;e it is the ap|pointment
of heaven. Perform your duty
as a good &s;ubject of the Deity, during the
time allotted you; and rejoice that a
period is fixed for your di&s;mi&s;&s;ion from the
pre&s;ent warfare. Remember that the &s;la|vi&s;h
dread of death de&s;troys all the comfort
of that life which you &s;eek to pre&s;erve.
Better to undergo the &s;troke of death at
<PB N="224" REF="231">
once, than to live in perpetual mi&s;ery from
the fear of dying.</P>
<P>SUCH di&s;cour&s;es as the&s;e are &s;pecious at
lea&s;t, and plau&s;ible. The arguments are not
without &s;trength, and ought to produce &s;ome
effect on a con&s;iderate reflecting mind. But
it is to be &s;u&s;pected that their effect will be
chiefly felt when the mind is calm and at
ea&s;e; rather when &s;peculating upon death
at a di&s;tance, than when beholding it at
hand. When the critical moment arrives
which places the anxious, trembling &s;oul on
the borders of an unknown world, rea&s;on|ings
drawn from nece&s;&s;ity and propriety
will be of &s;mall avail to quiet its alarms. In
order to afford relief, you mu&s;t give it hope;
you mu&s;t promi&s;e it protection; you mu&s;t
offer &s;omewhat on which it can lay hold for
&s;upport, amid&s;t the &s;truggles of labouring
nature. Hence the great importance of
tho&s;e di&s;coveries which revelation has made,
and of tho&s;e principles with which it fortifies
the heart. To the con&s;ideration of the&s;e let
us next proceed, and ob&s;erve their &s;uperiour
<PB N="225" REF="232">
efficacy for &s;urmounting the fear of death.
In order to judge of their importance, it
will be proper to take a view of death in
each of tho&s;e lights in which it appears mo&s;t
formidable to mankind.</P>
<P>IT may be con&s;idered, fir&s;t, as the ter|mination
of our pre&s;ent exi&s;tence; the final
period of all its joys and hopes. The con|cluding
&s;cene of any cour&s;e of action in
which we have been engaged with plea&s;ure,
even the la&s;t &s;ight of objects which we have
been long accu&s;tomed to behold, &s;eldom
fails of &s;triking the mind with painful re|gret.
How many circum&s;tances will concur
to heighten that regret, when the time comes
of our bidding an eternal adieu to the light
of day; to every pur&s;uit which had occu|pied
our attention as citizens of the world;
and to every friend and relation who had
attached our hearts? How dejecting is the
thought to the greate&s;t part of men, that
the &s;un &s;hall ri&s;e, and the &s;ea&s;ons &s;hall re|turn
to others, but no more to them; and
that while their neighbours are engaged in
<PB N="226" REF="233">
the u&s;ual affairs of life, they &s;hall be &s;hut
up in a dark and lone&s;ome man&s;ion, for|gotten,
and cut off from among men, as
though they had never been! <HI>I &s;aid, in the
cutting off of my days, I &s;hall go to the gates
of the grave. I am deprived of the re&s;idue of
my years. I &s;hall not &s;ee the Lord again in
the land of the living. I &s;hall behold man no
more with the inhabitants of the world</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">I&s;aiah xxxviii. 10, 11.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Let us now ob&s;erve, that the dejection
into which we are apt to &s;ink at &s;uch a
juncture, will bear proportion to the degree
of our attachment to the objects which we
leave, and to the importance of tho&s;e re|&s;ources
which remain with us when they
are gone. He who is taking farewell of a
country through which he had traveled
with &s;atisfaction, and he who is driven from
his native land, with which he had con|nected
every idea of &s;ettlement and com|fort,
will have very different feelings at the
time of departure. Such is the difference
which, at the hour of death, takes places be|tween
the righteous and the ungodly. The
<PB N="227" REF="234">
latter knows nothing higher or better than
the pre&s;ent &s;tate of exi&s;tence. His intere&s;ts,
his plea&s;ures, his expectation, all centered
here. He lived &s;olely for the enjoyments
of this world. Dreadful, therefore, and in|&s;upportable
mu&s;t be that event which &s;epa|rates
him from the&s;e for ever. Whereas the
culture of religion had previou&s;ly formed
the mind of a Chri&s;tian for a calm and ea&s;y
tran&s;ition from this life. It had in&s;tructed
him in the proper e&s;timate of &s;ublunary
happine&s;s. It had &s;et higher pro&s;pects be|fore
him. It had formed him to a more
refined ta&s;te of enjoyments than what the
common round of worldly amu&s;ements
could gratify. It gave him connections
and alliances with &s;piritual objects, which
are unknown to the men of the world.
Hence, though he be attached to life by the
natural feelings of humanity, he is rai&s;ed
above the weak and unmanly regret of part|ing
with it. He knew that it was intended
as preparatory only to a &s;ucceeding &s;tate.
As &s;oon as the &s;ea&s;on of preparation &s;hould
be fini&s;hed, he expected a removal; and
<PB N="228" REF="235">
when Providence gives the &s;ignal, he bids
adieu to the world with compo&s;ed re&s;olu|tion,
and undi&s;turbed heart.&mdash;What though
death interrupt him in the middle of his
de&s;igns, and break off the plans which he
had formed of being u&s;eful to his family
and the world? All the&s;e he leaves with
tranquillity in the hands of that Providence
to which he has ever been accu&s;tomed to
look up with re&s;ignation; which governed
the world wi&s;ely and graciou&s;ly before he
exi&s;ted; and which he knows will continue
to govern it with equal wi&s;dom and benig|nity,
when he &s;hall be in to no more. The
time of his departure was not left to his
own choice; but he believes it to be the
mo&s;t proper, becau&s;e it is the time cho&s;en
by Him who cannot err. <HI>Honourable age
is not that which &s;tandeth in length of time,
nor that which is mea&s;ured by number
of years. But wi&s;dom is the grey hair to
man; and an un&s;potted life is old age</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Wi&s;d. of Solomon, iv. 8. 9.</NOTE>.
When he behold his friends and relations
mourning around him, his heart may melt,
<PB N="229" REF="236">
but will not be overpowered; for it is re|lieved
by the thought that he is bidding
them only a temporary, not an eternal fare|wel.
He commends them, in the mean
time, to the ble&s;&s;ing of the God whom he
has &s;erved; and while he is parting from
them, he hears a vice which &s;ooths his
&s;pirit with tho&s;e comforting words, <HI>Leave
thy &s;atherle&s;s children; I will pre&s;erve them
alive; and let thy widow tru&s;t in me</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Jerem. xlix. 11.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BUT death is more than the conclu&s;ion
of human life. It is the gate which, at the
&s;ame time that it clo&s;es on this world, opens
into eternity. Under this view, it has often
been the &s;ubject of terrour to the &s;erious
and reflecting. The tran&s;ition they were
about to make was awful. Before them lay
a va&s;t undi&s;covered region, from who&s;e
bounds no traveler ever returned to bring
information of the reception which he found,
or of the objects which he met with there.
The fir&s;t conception which &s;ugge&s;ts it&s;elf is,
that the di&s;embodied &s;pirit is to appear be|fore
<PB N="230" REF="237">
its Creator, who is then to act as its
judge. The &s;trict inqui&s;iton which it mu&s;t
undergo, the impartial doom which it mu&s;t
hear pronounced, and the unalterable &s;tate
to which it &s;hall be a&s;&s;igned, are awful
forms ri&s;ing before the imagination. They
are ideas which con&s;cience forces upon all.
Mankind can neither avoid con&s;idering

avoid viewing death as the &s;ea&s;on when
their account is to be given. Such a &s;enti|ment

a good $word$ will convey comfort.

<P>We mu&s;t not judge of the &s;o$$iments of
men at the approach of death $y their or|dinary
<PB N="231" REF="238">
train of thought in the days of health
and ea&s;e. Their views of moral conduct
are then, too generally, &s;uperficial; &s;light ex|cu&s;es
&s;atisfy their minds, and the avocations
of life prevent their attention from dwelling
long on di&s;agreeable &s;ubjects. But when
altogether withdrawn from the affairs of the
world, they are left to their own reflections
on pa&s;t conduct; with their &s;pirits enfeebled
by di&s;ea&s;e, and their minds impre&s;&s;ed with
the terrours of an invi&s;ible region; the mo&s;t
re&s;olute are apt to de&s;pond, and even the
virtuous are in danger of &s;inking under the
remembrance of their errours and frailties.
The trembling mind ca&s;ts every where
around an anxious exploring eye after any
powder that can uphold, any mercy that will
&s;hield an &s;ave it. And accordingly we &s;ee
how eagerly every device has been embraced
which &s;uper&s;tition could invent in various
countries, for quieting the alarms of the de|parting
&s;pirit.</P>
<P>Here appears the great importance of
tho&s;e di&s;coveries which Chri&s;tianity has made
concerning the government of the univer&s;e.
<PB N="232" REF="239">
It di&s;plays the en&s;igns of grace and cle|mency.
It reveals the Almighty not as a
creator only and a judge, but as a compa&s;|&s;ionate
parent, <HI>who knows our &s;rame, who
remembers we are du&s;t, who pities us as a &s;a|ther
pritieth his children; and with whom there
is &s;orgivene&s;s,</HI> that he may be loved as well
as feared. The&s;e general view, however,
of the divine admini&s;tration, would not
have been &s;ufficient to give full relief, if
they had not been confirmed by certain de|ci&s;ive
facts, to which the mind can appeal
amid&s;t all its doubts and fears. Two &s;uch
facts the Go&s;pel holds forth to us, particu|larly
adapted to the &s;ituation of human na|ture
in its greate&s;t extremity; the atone|ment,
and the interce&s;&s;ion of Chri&s;t. There
is no &s;entiment more natural to men than
this, that guilt mu&s;t be expiated by &s;uffer|ing.
All government is founded on the
principle, that public ju&s;tice requires com|pen&s;ation
for crimes; and all religions pro|ceed
upon the belief, that, in order to the
pardon of the &s;inner, atonement mu&s;t be
made to the ju&s;tice of heaven. Hence the
<PB N="233" REF="240">
endle&s;s variety of &s;acrifices, victims, and
expiations which have filled the earth. The
great &s;acrifice which our Redeemer offered
for guilt, coincides with the&s;e natural &s;en|timents
of mankind in giving ea&s;e to the
heart. It &s;hows us the forfeit of guilt paid
by a divine per&s;onage in our behalf; and
allows us to look up to the Governour of
the world, as merciful to the guilty in con|&s;i&s;tency
with ju&s;tice and order. But &s;till
&s;ome anxiety might remain concerning the
exten&s;ion of that mercy to our own ca&s;e in
particular. An invi&s;ible &s;overeign is an
awful idea; almighty, unknown power is
always formidable, and would be ready to
overwhelm the &s;pirit of the feeble, were not
an interce&s;&s;or with that &s;overign revealed.
This interce&s;&s;or is one who lived and acted
in our own nature; who not only knows
but who experienced our frailty; who has
all the feelings of a brother of human in|firmity
and di&s;tre&s;s; who him&s;elf pa&s;&s;ed
through that <HI>valley of the &s;hadow of death</HI>
which is now opening on us; to who&s;e
powerful mediation with his father we have
<PB N="234" REF="241">
every encouragement to commit the charge
of our departing &s;pirits.&mdash;Such is the provi|&s;ion
which Chri&s;tianity has made for com|forting
the la&s;t hours of man. The atone|ment,
and the interce&s;&s;ion of Chri&s;t, are the
refuge of the penitent &s;inner, and the con|&s;olation
of the &s;aint. By their means the
throne of the univer&s;e if encircled with
mercy. The cloud which hung over the
invi&s;ible world begins to be di&s;per&s;ed; and
hope brightens through the gloom.</P>
<P>BUT what completes the triumph of good
men over death is, the pro&s;pect of eternal
felicity. This was the great object after
which all nations have &s;ighed, as the only
complete remedy both of the mi&s;eries of life
and the fears of death. On this, the learned
and the ignorant, the civilized and the &s;a|vage
tribes of mankind bent their longing
eyes; eagerly gra&s;ping at every argument,
and fondly indulging every hope, that could
promi&s;e them a propoitious Deity, and the
prolongation of exi&s;tence in a happier &s;tate.
But beyond wi&s;hes and feeble expectation,
<PB N="235" REF="242">
the light of nature could hardly reach.
Even the mo&s;t cultivated, philo&s;ophical mind
was, at the hour of di&s;&s;olution, left in pain|ful
&s;u&s;pen&s;e. Chri&s;tianity has put an end
to all he&s;itation and doubt on this important
&s;ubject. It has drawn a&s;ide the v$il through
which rea&s;on e&s;&s;ayed to penetrate; and has
di&s;played to full view the future dwellings
of the &s;pirits of the ju&s;t, the man&s;ions of
everla&s;ting re&s;t, <HI>the city of the living God.</HI>
Not only has it informed us that a &s;tate of
perfect felicity is prepared for the righteous,
but it has added to this information a variety
of circum&s;tances which render that &s;tate
&s;en&s;ible to our imagination, and e$couraging
to our hopes. It repre&s;ents it as fully &s;e|cured
by the gracious undertaking of the
Saviour of the world. It de&s;cribes it as <HI>an
inheritance,</HI> to which he has given his fol|lowers
a right and title. He is &s;aid to have
taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it in the name. He
ro&s;e from the grave as <HI>the &s;ir&s;t-fruits of them
that &s;leep;</HI> and under the character of their
<HI>fore-runn$r,</HI> entered into the heavenly re|gions.
<HI>I am the re&s;urrection and the life.
<PB N="236" REF="243">
He that believeth on me, though he were dead,
yet &s;hall be live. I give unto my &s;heep eter|nal
life. I a&s;cend to my Father and your
Father, to my God and you God</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">John xi. 25. xx. 17.</NOTE></P>
<P>Hence, to tho&s;e who have lived a vir|tuous
life, and who die in the faith of
Chri&s;t, the whole a&s;pect of death is changed.
Death is to them no longer the tyrant who
approaches with his iron rod, but the me&s;|&s;enger
who brings the tidings of life and
liberty. The pro&s;pects which open to them
cheer their minds. Even in the valley of
death's &s;hade, <HI>green pa&s;tures</HI> appear to ri&s;e.
They view them&s;elves as going forth, not
to lie &s;ilent and &s;olitary in the darkne&s;s of
the grave, not to wander for&s;aken in the
wide de&s;erts of the univer&s;e, not even to
pa&s;s into a region where they are altogether
&s;trangers and unknown; but to enter on a
land, new indeed to &s;ight, but by faith and
hope frequented long be&s;ore; where they
&s;hall continue to be under the charge of him
who hath hitherto been their guardian, be
re-united to many of their ancient and be|loved
<PB N="237" REF="244">
friends, and admitted to join the <HI>in|numerable
multitude, gathered out of all
nations and tongues and people, who &s;tand
before the throne of God.</HI> They leave be|hind
the dregs of their nature; and ex|change
this con&s;ined and gloomy apartment
of the univer&s;e, for the glorious man&s;ions
of their Father's hou&s;e. Ble&s;&s;ed &s;urely are
the dying in this hope, and <HI>ble&s;&s;ed the dead</HI>
in this fruition, <HI>re&s;ting from their labours
and followed by their works.</HI> Good men
are detained at pre&s;ent in the outer court of
the temple: Death admits them into the
holy place. As yet they &s;ojourn in the
territories of pilgrimage and exile: Death
brings them home to the native land of
Sprits. In this world they are divided
from one another, and mingled with the
worthle&s;s and the vile: Death unites in one
a&s;&s;embly all the pure and the ju&s;t. <HI>In the
&s;ight of the univer&s;e they &s;eemed to die, and
their d$pa$ture was taken for $ller d$&s;tru$|tion.
But they are is peace. Th$ir r$w$rd
al&s;o is with the Lord, and the care of them
with the mo&s;t High</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Wi&s;dom of Solomon iii. 2. $.&mdash;v. 15.</NOTE>&mdash;<HI>O Death! where
<PB N="238" REF="245">
is now thy &s;ling? O Grave! where is the
victory?</HI> Where are the terrours with
which thou ha&s;t &s;o long affrighted the na|tion?
Where are the dreary and de&s;olate
domains, the haunts of &s;pectres and &s;hades,
the abhorred dwellings of darkne&s;s and
corruption? At the touch of the divine
rod, they vi&s;ionary horrours have fled. The
&s;pell is broken. The dawn of the cele&s;tial
morning has di&s;pelled thy di&s;mal gloom;
and in&s;tead of the <HI>habitation of dragons,</HI> ap|pears
the paradi&s;e of God.</P>
<P>BUT &s;uppo&s;ing both the regreat of qui|ting
life, and the dread of entering into a
future &s;tate to be overcome, there is &s;till
one circum&s;tance which renders death form|idable
to many, that is, the &s;hock which
nature is apprehended to &s;u&s;tain at the &s;e|paration
of the &s;oul from the body.
Fromidable, I admit, this may ju&s;tly ren|der
it to them who&s;e langui&s;hing &s;pirits
have no inward fund whence they can then
draw relief. Firmne&s;s and &s;trength of
mind is peculiarly requi&s;ite for the &s;upport
of nature in its la&s;t extremity; and that
<PB N="239" REF="246">
&s;trength is &s;upplied by religion. The te&s;ti|mony
of a good con&s;cience, and the re|membrance
of a virtuous life, a well|grounded
tru&s;t in the divine acceptance, and
a firm hope of future felicity, are principles
&s;ufficient to give compo&s;ure and fortitude
to the heart, even in the mid&s;t of agony.
In what a high degree they can &s;u&s;pend or
alleviate the feelings of pain, has been fully
demon&s;trated by the magnanimous beha|viour
of &s;uch as have &s;uffered death in the
cau&s;e of con&s;cience and religion. How
often has the world beheld them advancing
to meet that &s;uppo&s;ed king of terrours, not
with calmne&s;s only, but with joy; rai&s;ed
by divine pro&s;pects and hopes into an en|tire
neglect and contempt of bodily &s;uffer|ing?</P>
<P>It is not without rea&s;on that a peculiar
a&s;&s;i&s;tance from heaven is looked for by good
men, at the hour of death. As they are
taught to believe, that in all the emergan|cies
of their life divine goodne&s;s has watched
over them, they have ground to conclude,
that at the la&s;t it will not for&s;ake them; but
<PB N="240" REF="247">
that at the &s;ea&s;on when its aid is mo&s;t
needed, it &s;hall be mo&s;t liberally commu|nicated.
Accordingly, a per&s;ua&s;ion &s;o con|gruous
to the benignity and compa&s;&s;ion of
the Father of mercies has been the comfort
of pious men in every age. <HI>My fle&s;h and
my heart faileth; but God is the &s;trength of
my heart. In the valley of the &s;hadow of
death I well fear no evil, for thou art with
me.</HI> When <HI>the rod and &s;taff</HI> of this &s;hepherd
of I&s;rael are held forth to his expiring &s;er|vants,
declining nature needs no other &s;up|port.
The &s;ecret influence of his reviving
&s;pirit is &s;ufficient for their con&s;olation and
&s;trength, while the painful &s;truggle with
mortality la&s;ts; till at length, when the
moment arrives the <HI>the &s;ilver cord mu&s;t be
loo&s;ed, and the golden bowl be broken,</HI> their
Almighty Protector carries off the immortal
&s;pirit unhurt by the fall of its carthly taber|nacle,
and places it in a better man&s;ion.&mdash;
How re&s;pectable and happy is &s;uch a con|clu&s;ion
of human life, when one in this
manner quits the &s;tage of time, honoured
and &s;upported with the pre&s;ence of his
<PB N="241" REF="248">
Creator, and enjoying, till the la&s;t moment
of reflection, the plea&s;ing thought, that he
has not lived in vain! <HI>I have fought a good
fight; I have fini&s;hed my cour&s;e; I have kept
the faith. Henceforth there is laid up for me
a crown of righteou&s;ne&s;s, which the Lord the
righteous judge &s;hall give me at that day</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">2 Tim. iv. 7, 8.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>AFTER the view which we have taken
of the advantages po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by good men for
overcoming the fears of death, the fir&s;t &s;en|timent
which &s;hould ari&s;e in our minds is
gratitude to Heaven for the hopes which
we enjoy by means of the Chri&s;tian reli|gion.
How depre&s;&s;ed and calamitous was
the human condition, as long as the terrour
of death hung, like a dark cloud, over the
inhabitants of the earth; when, after all the
toils of life, the melancholy &s;ilence of the
grave appeared finally to clo&s;e the &s;cene of
exi&s;tence; or, if a future &s;tate opened be|hind
it, that &s;tate teemed with all tho&s;e
forms of horrour which con&s;cioius guilt
could &s;ugge&s;t to a terrified imagination!
<PB N="242" REF="249">
The happie&s;t change which ever took place
in the circum&s;tances of the humar race, is
that produced by the di&s;coveries with which
we are ble&s;&s;ed concerning the government
of the univer&s;e, the redemption, of the world,
and the future de&s;tination of man. How
much dignity is thereby added to the hu|man
character and &s;tate? What light and
cheerfulne&s;s is introduced into our abode?
What eternal prai&s;e is due to Him who,
<HI>according to his abundant mercy, hath begot|ten
us again into a lively hope, by the re&s;ur|rection
of Je&s;es Chri&s;t from the dead, to an
inheritance incorruptible, undefiled, and that
fadeth not away, re&s;erved in heaven?</HI></P>
<P>The next effect which the &s;ubject we
have con&s;idered &s;hould produce, is an ear|ne&s;t
de&s;ire to acquire tho&s;e advantages which
good men enjoy at their death. The road
which leads to them is plain and obvious.
A peaceful and happy death is, by the ap|pointment
of Heaven, connected with a
holy band virtuous life. Let us renounce
criminal pur&s;uits and plea&s;ures; let us fear
<PB N="243" REF="250">
God and keep his commandments; let us
<HI>hold faith and a good con&s;cience,</HI> if we hope
for comfort at our la&s;t hour. To prepare
for this la&s;t hour, every wi&s;e man &s;hould
con&s;ider as his mo&s;t important concern.
Death many ju&s;tly be held the te&s;t of life.
Let a man have &s;upported his character
with e&s;teem and applau&s;e, as long as he
acted on the bu&s;y &s;tage of the world, if at
the end he &s;inks into dejection and terrour,
all his former honour is effaced; he departs
under the imputation of either a guilty con|&s;cience,
or a pu&s;illanimous mind. In the
other parts of human conduct, di&s;gui&s;e and
&s;ubtlety many impo&s;e on the world; but
&s;eldom can artifice be &s;upported in the hour
of death. The ma&s;k mo&s;t commonly falls
off, and the genuine character appears.
When we behold the &s;cene of life clo&s;ed
with proper compo&s;ure and dignity, we na|turally
infer integrity and fortitude. We
are led to believe that divine a&s;&s;i&s;tance &s;up|ports
the &s;oul, and we pre&s;age its tran&s;ition,
into a happier man&s;ion. <HI>Mark</HI> the perfect
<PB N="244" REF="251">
man and behold the upright; for the end of
that man is peace<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">P&s;alm xxxvii. 37.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE la&s;t in&s;truction which our &s;ubject
points out, re&s;pects the manner in which a
wi&s;e and good man ought to &s;tand affected
towards life and death. He ought not to
be &s;ervilely attached to the one. He has
no rea&s;on abjectly to dread the other. Life
is the gift of God, which he may ju&s;tly
cheri&s;h and hold dear. Nay, he is bound
by all fair means to guard and pre&s;erve it,
that he may continue to be u&s;eful in that
po&s;t of duty where Providence has placed
him. But there are higher principles to
which the love of life &s;hould remain &s;ub|ordinate.
Wherever religion, virtue, or
true honour, call him forth to danger, life
ought to be hazarded without fear. There
is a generous contempt of death which
&s;hould di&s;tingui&s;h tho&s;e who live and walk
by the faith of immortality. This is the
&s;ource of courage in a Chri&s;tian. His be|haviour
<PB N="245" REF="252">
ought to &s;hew the elevation of his
&s;oul above the pre&s;ent world; ought to di&s;|cover
the liberty which he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es of fol|lowing
the native &s;entiments of his mind,
without any of tho&s;e re&s;traints and fetters
which the fear of death impo&s;es on vicious
men.</P>
<P>At the &s;ame time, this rational contempt
of death mu&s;t carefully be di&s;tingui&s;hed
from that incon&s;iderate and thoughtle&s;s in|difference;
with which &s;ome have affected to
treat it. This is what cannot be ju&s;tified
on any principle of rea&s;on. Human life is
no trifle, which men may play away at their
plea&s;ure. Death, in every view, is an im|portant
event. It is the mo&s;t &s;olemn cri&s;is
of the human exi&s;tence. A good man has
rea&s;on to meet it with a calm and firm mind.
But no man is entitled to treat it with o&s;ten|tatious
levity. It calls for manly &s;eriou&s;|ne&s;s
of thought. It requires all the recol|lection
of which we are capable; that with
the proper di&s;po&s;ition of dependent beings,
when the du&s;t is about to <HI>return to its du&s;t,</HI>
we may deliver up <HI>the &s;pirit to Him who
gave it.</HI></P>

<P>IN this my&s;terious book of Scripture many

are not indeed &s;o foretold as to afford clear

<PB N="247" REF="254">
of their coming to pa&s;s. It would have
been, on many accounts, improper to have
lifted up too far that awful veil which covers
futurity. The intention of the Spirit of
God was not to gratify the curio&s;ity of the
learned, by di&s;clo&s;ing to them the fate of
monarchies and nations, but to &s;atisfy the
&s;erious concerning the general plan, and final
i&s;&s;ue, of the divine government. Amid&s;t
tho&s;e di&s;tre&s;&s;es which befel Chri&s;tians during
the fir&s;t ages, the di&s;coveries made in this
book were peculiarly &s;ea&s;onable; as they
&s;hewed that there was an Almighty Guar|dian,
who watched with particular attention
over the intere&s;ts of the church which he
had formed; who fore&s;aw all the commo|tions
which were to happen among the
kingdoms of the earth, and would &s;o over|rule
them as to promote in the end the

On this day, in particular, when we are to

of the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>I. WHAT the words of the text mo&s;t
obviou&s;ly &s;ugge&s;t is, that heaven is to be
con&s;idered as a &s;tate of ble&s;&s;ed &s;ociety. <HI>A
multitude,</HI> a numerous a&s;&s;embly, are here
repre&s;ented as &s;haring together the &s;ame
felicity and honour. Without &s;ociety, it is
<PB N="250" REF="257">
impo&s;&s;ible for man to be happy. Place
him in a region where he was &s;urrounded
with every plea&s;ure; yet there, if he found
him&s;elf a &s;olitary individual, he would pine
and langui&s;h. They are not merely our
wants, and our mutual dependence, but
our native in&s;tincts al&s;o, which impel us to
a&s;&s;ociate together. The intercour&s;e which
we here maintain with our fellows, is a
&s;ource of our chief enjoyments. But, alas!
how much are the&s;e allayed by a variety of
di&s;agreeable circum&s;tances that enter into all
our connexions! Sometimes we &s;uffer
from the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of tho&s;e whom we love;
and &s;ometimes from their vices or frailties.
Where friend&s;hip is cordial, it is expo&s;ed to
the wounds of painful &s;ympathy, and to
the angui&s;h of violent &s;eparation Where
it is &s;o cool as not to occa&s;ion &s;ympathetic
pains, it is never productive of much plea|&s;ure.
The ordinary commerce of the world
con&s;i&s;ts in a circulation of frivolous inter|cour&s;e,
in which the heart has no concern.
It is generally in&s;ipid, and often &s;oured
by the &s;lighte&s;t difference in humour, or op|po&s;ition
<PB N="251" REF="258">
of intere&s;t. We fly to company in
order to be relieved from weari&s;ome corre|&s;pondence
with our&s;elves; and the vexations
which we meet with in &s;ociety, drive us
back again into &s;olitude. Even among the
virtuous, di&s;&s;en&s;ions ari&s;e; and di&s;agree|ment
in opinion too often produces aliena|tion
of heart. We form few connexions
where &s;omewhat does not occur to di&s;ap|point
our hopes. The beginnings are often
plea&s;ing. We flatter our&s;elves with having
found tho&s;e who will never give us any
di&s;gu&s;t. But weakne&s;&s;es are too &s;oon di&s;|covered.
Su&s;picions ari&s;e; and love waxes
cold. We are jealous of one another, and
accu&s;tomed to live in di&s;gui&s;e. A &s;tudied
civility a&s;&s;umes the name without the plea&s;ure
of friend&s;hip; and &s;ecret animo&s;ity and
envy are often concealed under the care&s;&s;es
of di&s;&s;embled affection.</P>
<P>Hence the plea&s;ure of earthly &s;ociety,
like all our other plea&s;ures, is extremely im|perfect;
and can give us a very faint con|ception
of the joy that mu&s;t ari&s;e from the
&s;ociety of perfect &s;pirits in a happier world.
<PB N="252" REF="259">
Here, it is with difficulty that we can &s;e|lect
from the corrupted crowd a few with
whom we wi&s;h to a&s;&s;ociate in &s;trict union.
There, are a&s;&s;embled all the wi&s;e, the holy,
and the ju&s;t who ever exi&s;ted in the uni|ver&s;e
of God; without any di&s;tre&s;s to trou|ble
their mutual bli&s;s, or any &s;ource of di&s;|agreement
to interrupt their perpetual
harmony. Artifice and concealment are
unknown there. There, no competitors
&s;truggle; no factions contend; no rivals
&s;upplant each other. The voice of di&s;cord
never ri&s;es, the whi&s;per of &s;u&s;picion never
circulates, among tho&s;e innocent and be|nevolent
&s;pirits Each, happy in him&s;elf,
participates in the happine&s;s of all the re&s;t;
and by reciprocal communications of love
and friend&s;hip, at once receives from, and
adds to the &s;um of general felicity. Re|new
the memory of the mo&s;t affectionate
friends with whom you were ble&s;t in any
period of your life. Dive&s;t them of all
tho&s;e infirmities which adhere to the hu|man
character. Recal the mo&s;t plea&s;ing
and tender moments which you ever en|joyed
<PB N="253" REF="260">
in their &s;ociety; and the remem|brance
of tho&s;e &s;en&s;ations mat a&s;&s;i&s;t you
in conceiving that felicity which is po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed
by the &s;aints above. The happine&s;s
of <HI>brethren dwelling together in unity,</HI> is,
with great ju&s;tice and beauty, compared by
the P&s;almi&s;t to &s;uch things as are mo&s;t re|fre&s;hing
to the heart of man; to the fra|grancy
of the riche&s;t odours, and to the
reviving influence of &s;oft aetherial dews.
<HI>It is like the precious ointment poured on the
head of Aaron; and like the dew of Hermon,
even the dew that de&s;cendeth on the moun|tains
of Zion, where the Lord commandeth
the ble&s;&s;ing, even life for evermore</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">P&s;. cxxxiii. 1.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the felicity which &s;prings from per|fect
love, there are two circum&s;tances which
particularly enhance the ble&s;&s;edne&s;s of that
<HI>multitude who &s;tand before the throne;</HI> the&s;e
are, acce&s;s to the mo&s;t exalted &s;ociety, and
renewal of the mo&s;t tender connexions.
The former is pointed out in the Scripture
by <HI>joining the innumerable company of angels,
and the general a&s;&s;embly and church of the
<PB N="254" REF="261">
fir&s;t-born; by &s;itting down with Abraham,
and I&s;aac, and Jacob, in the kingdom of
heaven</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Heb. vii. 22,. 23. Matth. viii. 11.</NOTE>; a promi&s;e which opens the &s;u|blime&s;t
pro&s;pects to the human mind. It
allows good men to entertain the hope, that,
&s;eparated from all the dregs of the human
ma&s;s, from that mixed and polluted crowd
in mid&s;t of which they now dwell, they
&s;hall be permitted to mingle with prophets,
patriarchs and apo&s;tles, with legi&s;lators and
heroes, with all tho&s;e great and illu&s;trious
&s;pirits, who have &s;hone in former ages as
the &s;ervants of God, or the benefactors of
men; who&s;e deeds we are accu&s;tome to
celebrate; who&s;e &s;teps we now follow at a
di&s;tance; and who&s;e names we pronounce
with veneration.</P>
<P>United to this high a&s;&s;embly, the ble&s;&s;|ed
at the &s;ame time renew tho&s;e ancient
connexions with virtuous friends which had
been di&s;&s;olved by death. The pro&s;pect to
this awakens in the heart the mo&s;t plea&s;ing
and tender &s;entiment which perhaps can fill
it, in this mortal &s;tate. For of all the &s;or|rows
<PB N="255" REF="262">
rows which we are here doomed to endure,
none is &s;o bitter as that occa&s;ioned by the
fatal &s;troke which &s;eparates us, in appear|ance,
for ever, from tho&s;e to whom either
nature or friend&s;hip had intimately joined
our hearts. Memory, from time to time,
renews the angui&s;h; opens the wound
which &s;eemed once to have been clo&s;ed;
and by recalling joys that are pa&s;t and gone,
touches every &s;pring of painful &s;en&s;ibility.
In the&s;e agonizing moments, how relieving
the thought, that the &s;eparation is only
temporary, not eternal; that there is a time
to come of re-union with tho&s;e with whom
our happie&s;t days were &s;pent; who&s;e joys
and &s;orrows once were ours; and from
whom, after we &s;hall have landed on the
peaceful &s;hore where they dwell, no revo|lutions
of nature &s;hall ever be able to part
us more!&mdash;Such is the &s;ociety of the ble&s;&s;ed
above. Of &s;uch are the multitude compo&s;ed
who <HI>&s;tand before the throne.</HI> Let us now
ob&s;erve,</P>
<P>II. THAT this is not only a ble&s;&s;ed but
a numerous &s;ociety. It is called a <HI>mul|titude,
<PB N="256" REF="263">
a great multitude, a great multitude
which no man could number.</HI> The&s;e expre&s;|&s;ions
convey the mo&s;t enlarged views of the
kingdom of glory. Di&s;may not your&s;elves
with the apprehen&s;ion of heaven being a
confined and almo&s;t inacce&s;&s;ible region, into
which it is barely po&s;&s;ible for a &s;mall hand|ful
to gain admi&s;&s;ion, after making their
e&s;cape from the general wreck of the human
race. <HI>In my Father's hou&s;e,</HI> &s;aid our Sa|viour,
<HI>there are many man&s;ions.</HI> That <HI>city
of the living God</HI> towards which you profe&s;s
to bend your cour&s;e, is prepared for the
reception of citizens innumerable. It
already abounds with inhabitants; and
more and more &s;hall be added to it, until
the end of time. Whatever difficulties
there are in the way which leads to it, they
have been often &s;urmounted. The path,
though narrow, is neither impa&s;&s;able, nor
untrodden. Though the gate &s;tands not
&s;o wide as that which opens into hell, yet
through the narrow gate multitudes have
entered, and been crowned.</P>
<P>It is much to be lamented that among all
denominations of Chri&s;tians, the unchari|table
<PB N="257" REF="264">
&s;pirit has prevailed of unwarrantably
circum&s;cribing the terms of divine grace
within a narrow circle of their own draw|ing.
The one half of the Chri&s;tian world
has often doomed the other, without mercy,
to eternal perdition. Without the pale of
that church to which each &s;ect belongs, they
&s;eem to hold it impo&s;&s;ible for &s;alvation to be
attained. But is this the genuine &s;pirit of
the Go&s;pel? Can a Chri&s;tian believe the
effects of the &s;ufferings of Chri&s;t, to be no
greater than the&s;e? For this did the Son
of God de&s;cend from the highe&s;t heavens,
and pour out his &s;oul unto the death, that
only a few who adopt the &s;ame modes of
expre&s;&s;ion, and join in the &s;ame forms of
wor&s;hip with us, might be brought to the
kingdom of heaven? Is this all <HI>the deli|verance
he has wrought upon the earth? He
was with child; he was in pain;</HI> and &s;hall
he not <HI>&s;ee of the travail of his &s;oul, and be
&s;atisfied?</HI> Surely, the Scripture has given
us full ground to conclude that the trophies
of our Redeemer's grace &s;hall corre&s;pond to
the greatne&s;s of his power. <HI>The captain of
<PB N="258" REF="265">
our &s;alvation &s;hall bring many &s;ons with
him&s;elf to glory. The plea&s;ure of the Lord
&s;hall pro&s;per in his hand. He &s;hall &s;ee his
&s;eed: He &s;hall ju&s;tify many. Men &s;hall be
ble&s;&s;ed in him, and all nations &s;hall call him
ble&s;&s;ed.</HI> For our farther encouragement,
let us ob&s;erve,</P>
<P>III. THAT the heavenly &s;ociety is repre|&s;ented
in the text, as gathered out of all the
varieties of the human race. This is inti|mated
by the remarkable expre&s;&s;ions of <HI>a
multitude which no man could number, of all
nations and kindreds and people and tongues;</HI>
as if de&s;igned on purpo&s;e to correct our
narrow notions of the extent, and power of
divine grace. They whom di&s;tant &s;eas and
regions now divide, who&s;e languages and
manners are at pre&s;ent &s;trange to one an|other,
&s;hall then mingle in the &s;ame a&s;&s;em|bly.
No &s;ituation is &s;o remote, and no
&s;tation &s;o unfavourable as to preclude acce&s;s
to the heavenly felicity. A road is opened
by the divine &s;pirit to tho&s;e bli&s;sful habita|tions,
from all corners of the earth, and
<PB N="259" REF="266">
from all conditions of human life; from
the peopled city, and from the &s;olitary de|&s;ert;
from the cottages of the poor, and
from the palaces of kings; from the dwell|ings
of ignorance and &s;implicity, and from
the regions of &s;cience and improvement.
<HI>They &s;hall come,</HI> &s;ays our ble&s;&s;ed Lord him|&s;elf,
<HI>from the ea&s;t and from the we&s;t, from
the north and from the &s;outh, and &s;it down in
the kingdom o God</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Luke xiii. 29.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Such di&s;coveries &s;erve both to enlarge our
conceptions of the extent of divine good|ne&s;s,
and to remove tho&s;e fears which are
ready to ari&s;e from particular &s;ituations in
life. Were you permitted to draw a&s;ide the
veil, and to view that diver&s;ified a&s;&s;embly
of the ble&s;&s;ed who &s;urround the throne, you
would behold among them numbers who
have overcome the &s;ame difficulties which
encounter you, and which you dread as
in&s;uperable. You would behold there, the
unin&s;tructed, with whom an upright inten|tion
&s;upplied the place of knowledge; the
<PB N="260" REF="267">
feeble, whom divine grace had &s;trength|ened;
and the mi&s;led, whom it had brought
back into the right path. You would be|hold
the young who had &s;urmounted the
allurements of youthful plea&s;ure, and the
old who had born the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of age with
undecayed con&s;tancy; many whom want
could not tempt to di&s;hone&s;ty; many whom
riches did not &s;educe into pride or impiety;
many who in the mo&s;t difficult and en&s;nar|ing
circum&s;tances, in the mid&s;t of camps
and armies and corrupted courts, had pre|&s;erved
un&s;ullied integrity. In a word,
<HI>from all kindreds and people,</HI> that is, from
all ranks of life, and all tribes of men, even
from among <HI>publicans and &s;inners,</HI> you
would behold tho&s;e whom divine a&s;&s;i&s;tance
had conducted to future glory.&mdash;And is
not the &s;ame a&s;&s;i&s;tance, in its full extent,
offered al&s;o to us? Encompa&s;&s;ed, while
we run the Chri&s;tian race with this <HI>cloud of
witne&s;&s;es</HI> who have fini&s;hed their cour&s;e
with &s;ucce&s;s; animated, while we <HI>fight the
good fight,</HI> with the &s;houts of tho&s;e who
have overcome and are crowned, &s;hall de|&s;pair
<PB N="261" REF="268">
enervate or deject our minds? From
the happy multitude above, there i&s;&s;ues a
voice which ought to &s;ound perpetually in
the ear of faith, <HI>Be ye faithful unto the
death, and ye &s;hall receive the crown of life;
Be &s;trong in the Lord and in the power of
his might; Be followers of us who through
faith and patience are now inheriting the
promi&s;es.</HI> Con&s;ider,</P>
<P>IV. THE de&s;cription given in the $ext
of the happine&s;s and glory of the heavenly
&s;ociety. They were beheld by the apo&s;tle
<HI>&s;tanding before the throne, and before the
lamb, cloathed with white robes and palms
in their hands.</HI> All that the&s;e <HI>palms and
white robes</HI> import, it is not given us now to
under&s;tand. We know that among all na|tions
they have been u&s;ed as en&s;igns of joy
and victory; and are undoubtedly employed
here to repre&s;ent that di&s;tingui&s;hed felicity
and honour, to which human nature &s;hall be
then advanced. But we mu&s;t be endowed
with the faculties of the ble&s;&s;ed, in order to
comprehend their employments and plea|&s;ures;
<PB N="262" REF="269">
and therefore on this part of the
&s;ubject I &s;hall not attempt to enlarge. The
&s;ilence of humble and re&s;pectful hope, be|ter
becomes us that the indulgence of tho&s;e
excur&s;ions of fancy, which degrade the &s;ub|ject
they endeavour to exalt.</P>
<P>One circum&s;tance only cannot fail to at|tract
particular attention; that the ble&s;&s;ed
are here de&s;cribed as <HI>&s;tanding before the
throne and before the lamb;</HI> that is, enjoy|ing
the immediate pre&s;ence of the great
Creator, and of the merciful Redeemer of
the world. The unhappy di&s;tance at which
we are now removed from God, is the
&s;ource of all our woes. Tho&s;e territories
which we inhabit, are not His abode. They
are regions of exile. They are the dwell|ings
of a fallen race; and are condemned
to be inve&s;ted with clouds and darkne&s;s.
Here, God &s;tandeth afar off. In vain we
often pur&s;ue his pre&s;ence through his works,
his ways, and his religious in&s;titutions. He
is &s;aid to be <HI>a God that hideth him&s;elf. He
dwelleth,</HI> as to us, <HI>in the &s;ecret place of
thunder. He holdeth back the face of his
<PB N="263" REF="270">
throne, and &s;preadeth a thick cloud upon it.</HI>
The manife&s;tation of his pre&s;ence &s;hall be
the &s;ignal for the renovation of all things.
When that <HI>Sun of righteou&s;ne&s;s</HI> breaks forth
from the cloud which now conceals him,
&s;orrow and &s;in, and every evil thing &s;hall
fly away before the brightne&s;s of his face.
For neither guilt nor mi&s;ery can remain
where God dwells. As the ri&s;ing of the
&s;un transforms at once the face of nature,
and converts the whole extent of &s;pace
over which his beams are &s;pread, into a
region of light, &s;o &s;hall the divine pre&s;ence,
as &s;oon as it is revealed, diffu&s;e univer&s;al
bli&s;s over all who behold it. It imports
<HI>fullne&s;s of joy, and plea&s;ure for evermore.</HI>
The in&s;pired writer of this book thus de|&s;cribes
its effects: <HI>There &s;hall be no more
death, neither &s;orrow, nor crying nor pain;
for the former things are pa&s;&s;ed away. He
that &s;at upon the throne &s;aid, Behold I make
all things new. They &s;hall hunger no more,
neither thir&s;t any more. But the Lamb
which is in the mid&s;t of the throne &s;hall feed
them, and &s;hall lead them unto living foun|tains
<PB N="264" REF="271">
of water. God &s;hall wipe away all
tears from their eyes.</HI> But, de&s;cending from
this too &s;ublime theme, let us</P>
<P>V. TURN our attention to a circum|&s;tance
in the &s;tate of future happine&s;s, more
commen&s;urate to our pre&s;ent conceptions,
which is &s;ugge&s;ted by the commentary upon
the words of the text given in the &s;equel of
the chapter. <HI>And one of the elders an&s;wered,
&s;aying unto me, What are the&s;e which are ar|rayed
in white robes; and whence came they?
And I &s;aid unto him, Sir, thou knowe&s;t. And
he &s;aid unto me, The&s;e are they which came
out of great tribulation</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Rev. viii. 13, 14.</NOTE>. This explanatory
circum&s;tance may relate particularly to the
ca&s;e of tho&s;e primitive &s;ufferers, who en|dured
&s;evere per&s;ecution in the cau&s;e of the
go&s;pel. But, in general, it pre&s;ents this na|tural
and beautiful view of the future feli|city
of good men, that it is their re&s;t from
the troubles and toils of life. For, to all,
even to the happie&s;t, human life is tribula|tion
and conflict. No man is thoroughly
<PB N="265" REF="272">
at ca&s;e in his condition. Pur&s;uits &s;ucceed|ing
to pur&s;uits keep us in con&s;tant agitation;
while frequent returns of di&s;ppointment
break our plans, and oppre&s;s our &s;pirits.
Fatigued by &s;uch a variety of toils, mankind
have ever looked forward to re&s;t as their
favourite object. Throughout all their
ranks, from the highe&s;t to the lowe&s;t, they
are in perpetual chace of it; and it perpe|tually
flies before them. It is an object
which here they are doomed always to &s;eek,
and never to enjoy.</P>
<P>The nature and laws of our pre&s;ent &s;tate
admit not the gratification of this favourite
wi&s;h. for, be&s;ides the nece&s;&s;ity of trouble
in order to fulfil the purpo&s;es of di&s;cipline
and improvement, our very happine&s;s, &s;uch
as it is in this world, requires a circulation
of labours. Our enjoyment con&s;i&s;ts in pur|&s;uit,
not in attainment. Attainment is with
us, for mo&s;t part, the grave of plea&s;ure.
Had we no object to excite fre&s;h activity,
and to impel us to new toils, human life
would quickly &s;tagnate in melancholy indo|lence.
At the &s;ame time, the current of all
<PB N="266" REF="273">
our wi&s;hes tends to repo&s;e. Imaginary
forms float ince&s;&s;antly before our view, of
the happine&s;s which is to be enjoyed in re&s;t:
And from this conflict between our wi&s;hes
on the one hand, and our actual &s;ituation
on the other, ari&s;e much of the di&s;quiet,
and much of the infelicity, of human life.
It is only in heaven that the tranquil re|po&s;e,
which on earth is no more than a
plea&s;ing phantom, &s;hall be fully realized.
There, <HI>remaineth</HI> at la&s;t <HI>a re&s;t for the people
of God;</HI> re&s;t from the di&s;turbance of pa&s;&s;ion,
the vanity of pur&s;uit, and the vexation of
di&s;appointment; re&s;t from all the &s;ins and
the &s;orrows of this mi&s;erable world; re&s;t,
which &s;hall not be merely an indolent ce&s;|&s;ation
from labour, but a full and &s;atisfying
enjoyment. Good men &s;hall <HI>re&s;t from their
labours, and their works &s;hall follow them.</HI>
They have <HI>come out of great tribulation.</HI>
They have fulfilled, with honour, their ap|pointed
cour&s;e of trial. They have &s;at
down on the &s;eat of the conqueror; and of
pa&s;t labours nothing remains but the plea&s;ing
<PB N="267" REF="274">
review, and the happy fruits. There is &s;till
to be con&s;idered,</P>
<P>VI. ONE very material circum&s;tance,
de&s;criptive both of the character, and of the
happine&s;s, of tho&s;e who enjoy the heavenly
bli&s;s. Not only have <HI>they come out of great
tribulation,</HI> but, as the spirit of God adds
in explaining the text, <HI>they haver wa&s;hed
their robes, and made them white in the
blood of the Lamb</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Rev. viii. 14.</NOTE>. Two things are here
&s;ugge&s;ted; the &s;anctity of the ble&s;&s;ed, and
the means by which it is attained.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, their &s;anctity or purity is emblema|tically
de&s;cribed, by their being clothed in
<HI>robes which are wa&s;hed and made white.</HI>
In order to qualify human nature for the
enjoyment of &s;uch happine&s;s as I have en|deavoured
to de&s;cribe, it mu&s;t undergo a
change &s;o great as to receive in Scripture the
appellation of <HI>a new birth;</HI> a change to
which all the in&s;titutions of religion, and
all the operations of grace, contribute in this
life, but which is not completed till the next.

In this &s;anctity, or regeneration, con&s;i&s;ts not
only the nece&s;&s;ary preparation for future fe|licity,
but, which is not &s;o commonly at|tended
to, con&s;i&s;ts an e&s;&s;entail part of that
felicity it&s;elf. For, whence ari&s;es the mi|&s;ery
of this pre&s;ent world? It is not owing
to our cloudy atmo&s;phere, our changing &s;ea|&s;ons,
and inclement &s;kies. It is not owing
to the debility of our bodies, or to the un|equal
di&s;tribution of the goods of fortune.
Amid&s;t all di&s;advantages of this kind, a pure,
a &s;tedfa&s;t, and enlightened mind, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed
of exalted virtue, could enjoy it&s;elf in peace,
and &s;mile at the impotent a&s;&s;aults of fortune
and the elements. It is within our&s;elves,
that mi&s;ery has fixed its &s;eat. Our di&s;or|dered
hearts, our guilty pa&s;&s;ions, our vio|lent
prejudices and mi&s;placed de&s;ires, are
the in&s;truments of the torment which we
endure. The&s;e &s;harpen the darts which
adver&s;ity would otherwi&s;e point in vain
again&s;t us. The&s;e are the <HI>vials of wrath</HI>
which pour forth plagues on the inhabitants
of the earth; and make the dwellings of
nations become the abodes of woe. Thence
<PB N="269" REF="276">
di&s;content, and remor&s;e, gnaw the hearts of
individuals. Thence &s;ociety is torn by open
violence, or undermined by &s;ecret treachery;
and man is transformed into a &s;avage to
man.</P>
<P>But &s;uppo&s;e &s;in to be bani&s;hed from the
world; &s;uppo&s;e perfect purity and charity
to de&s;cend from heaven, and to animate
every human brea&s;t; and you would be|hold
the pre&s;ent habitation of men changed
into the paradi&s;e of God. The undi&s;turbed
enjoyment of a holy mind, and of a bli&s;sful
union with one another, would &s;carcely al|low
us to feel tho&s;e external evils, of which
we now &s;o loudly complain. All nature
would a&s;&s;ume a different appearance around
us. That golden age which was &s;o long
the &s;ubject of the philo&s;opher's dream, and
of the poet's &s;ong, would in fact take place.
According to the beautiful language of an|cient
prophecy, <HI>&s;prings would then ri&s;e in
the de&s;ert, and rivers be opened in the thir&s;ty
land. The wilderne&s;s and the &s;olitary place
would be glad. The wolf would dwell with
the lamb, and the leopard lie down with the
<PB N="270" REF="277">
kid. Judgment would dwell in the wilder|ne&s;s,
and righteou&s;ne&s;s remain in the fruitful
field. The de&s;ert would rejoice, and blo&s;&s;om
as the ro&s;e.</HI>&mdash;If &s;uch, even in this world,
would be the effects of innocence and virtue
completely re&s;tored, how much greater mu&s;t
they be in that <HI>new earth and tho&s;e new
heavens,</HI> where rectitude of nature &s;hall be
combined with every circum&s;tance of ex|ternal
felicity? It is the pre&s;ent imperfect
&s;tate of human virtue that hinders us from
conceiving fully the influence of righteou&s;|ne&s;s
upon happine&s;s. The <HI>robes</HI> in which
the be&s;t men are now clothed, to u&s;e the
language of the text, are &s;ullied with &s;o
many &s;tains, as to convey no adequate idea
of the original beauty which belongs to the
garb of righteou&s;ne&s;s. But when the&s;e
&s;tains &s;hall be wa&s;hed away, when the&s;e
robes &s;hall be made perfectly white and
pure, a lu&s;tre will flow from them of which
we can, as yet, form no conception.</P>
<P>But how are the robes of the ble&s;&s;ed thus
wa&s;hed? Whence is derived that &s;potle&s;s
purity in which they are arrayed? The
<PB N="271" REF="278">
Spirit of God hath an&s;wered us, <HI>from the
blood of the Lamb;</HI> leading our thoughts to
that high di&s;pen&s;ation of mercy, to which
the &s;aints above owe their e&s;tabli&s;hment,
fir&s;t in grace, and then in glory. From
that blood which was <HI>&s;hed for the remi&s;&s;ion
of &s;ins,</HI> flow both the atonement of human
guilt, and the regeneration of human na|ture.
Human nature had fallen too low to
be capable of retrieving it&s;elf. It could not
regain its primitive innocence, and &s;till le&s;s
was capable of rai&s;ing it&s;elf &s;o high in the
&s;cale of exi&s;tence as to mingle with angels.
We had neither &s;ufficient knowledge to di&s;|cover,
nor virtue to merit, nor ability to
qualify our&s;elves for enjoying, cele&s;tial glory.
Heaven mu&s;t have been either covered from
our view by perpetual darkne&s;s, or only
beheld from afar as an inacce&s;&s;ible region,
if Chri&s;t had not interpo&s;ed to <HI>open for us a
new and living way within the veil.</HI> The
obligations which his generous undertaking
has conferred upon the human race will tend
highly to increa&s;e the felicity of the ble&s;&s;ed.
The &s;en&s;e of being di&s;tingui&s;hed by &s;o il|lu&s;trious
<PB N="272" REF="279">
a benefactor, and the corre&s;pond|ing
returns of gratitude and love to him,
form &s;ome of the mo&s;t plea&s;ing of tho&s;e
emotions which &s;hall continue to delight
them through all eternity.</P>
<P>FROM tho&s;e views of a &s;tate of future
happine&s;s which the text has &s;ugge&s;ted, va|rious
in&s;tructions relating to life and prac|tice
naturally ari&s;e. We are taught to rectify
our notions of felicity; to look for it, not
in what is external, but in what relates to
the mind and heart; in good di&s;po&s;itions
and a purified &s;oul; in unity and friend&s;hip
with one another, and in the divine pre|&s;ence
and favour. If &s;uch things form the
principal articles of future bli&s;s, they cannot
but be e&s;&s;entail to our happine&s;s in the more
early periods of exi&s;tence; and he who
&s;eeks his chief enjoyments from an oppo&s;ite
quarter, is erring widely from the path
which conducts to felicity.</P>
<P>We are farther taught whence to derive
con&s;tancy and per&s;everance, amid&s;t the pre|&s;ent
di&s;couragements of a virtuous life. In
<PB N="273" REF="280">
this world, we often behold good men de|pre&s;&s;ed,
and the wicked pro&s;pering around
us. Our be&s;t deeds meet with unju&s;t re|turns
from an ungrateful world. Sincerity
is over-reached by craft, and innocence falls
a victim to power. But let us not on &s;uch
occa&s;ions &s;ay within our&s;elves, <HI>that in vain
we have clean&s;ed our hearts, and wa&s;hed our
hands in innocency.</HI> Let us re&s;t on the a&s;|&s;urance,
that the&s;e di&s;orders extend not far
in the kingdom of God. They affect only
the fir&s;t &s;tage of exi&s;tence. They relate to
di&s;cipline and trial, which will &s;oon be
fini&s;hed. In that permanent &s;tate which is
about to open, a new and better order of
things &s;hall ari&s;e. When dejected with the
evils of life, let us look upward to that happy
<HI>multitude who have come out of great tribu|lation,
and now &s;tand before the throne.</HI>
Until the day arrive which &s;hall join us to
that ble&s;&s;ed a&s;&s;embly, let us &s;hew our&s;elves
worthy of the hope that is before us, by
&s;upporting with a con&s;tant mind the trials of
our fidelity. <HI>Be patient; &s;tabli&s;h your hearts.
The coming of the Lord draweth nigh.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="274" REF="281">
From the pro&s;pects which the text has
afforded, we may likewi&s;e learn what the
&s;pirit is which &s;hould regulate our life.
Sanctity of conduct, dignity of character,
elevation of affections, become tho&s;e who
expect to mingle with angels, and <HI>&s;pirits of
ju&s;t men made perfect.</HI> I mean not that &s;uch
pro&s;pects &s;hould carry away our whole at|tention
from the pre&s;ent world, where un|doubtedly
lies the chief &s;cene of human ac|tion,
and human duty. But while we act
as inhabitants of the earth, we ought at the
&s;ame time &s;o to remember our connection
with a better world, as not to deba&s;e our|seves with what is mean, not to defile our|&s;elves
with what is impure, not to entangle
our&s;elves among what is en&s;naring, in the
pre&s;ent &s;tate. Let neither its advantages
elate, nor its di&s;appointments deject us;
but with an equal &s;pirit, with a mind full
of immortality, let us pa&s;s through all the
changes of this mortal life.</P>
<P>Finally, let the di&s;coveries of future hap|pine&s;s
in&s;pire us with &s;uitable gratitude to
God and Chri&s;t; to the eternal Father, who
<PB N="275" REF="282">
originally decreed &s;uch rewards for the
righteous; and to the Son, who acts in the
high character of the di&s;pen&s;er of the divine
mercies, and the great re&s;torer of the fallen
race of men. Particularly, when approach|ing
to God in &s;olemn acts of devotion, &s;uch
as we are this day to perform, let gratitude
be alive and ardent in our heart. The com|memoration
of our Saviour's death is in a
high degree &s;uited to awaken every emotion
of tenderne&s;s and love. It brings before us,
under one view, all the obligations which
we lie under to this great benefactor of man|kind.
When ju&s;t ready to &s;uffer for our
&s;ake, he in&s;tituted this holy &s;acrament, and
&s;aid, <HI>Do this in remembrance of me.</HI>&mdash;Whom,
O ble&s;&s;ed Je&s;us! &s;hall we ever remember, if
we are capable of forgetting Thee? Thee,
to whom we owe the forgivene&s;s of &s;in, and
the re&s;toration of divine favour; our victory
over death, and our hope of life eternal!
Thou ha&s;t enlarged our views beyond the&s;e
territories of di&s;order and darkne&s;s. Thou
ha&s;t di&s;covered to us the <HI>city of the living

<Q>Charity&mdash;thinketh no evil.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>RELIGION and Government are the
two great foundations of order and
comfort among mankind.<NOTE PLACE="marg">SERM. X.</NOTE> Government re|&s;trins
the outrages and crimes which would
be &s;ubver&s;ive of &s;ociety, &s;ecures the pro|perty,
and defends the lives of its &s;ubjects.
But the defect of government is, that hu|man
laws can extend no farther than to the
actions of men. Though they protect us
from external violence, they leave us open
on different &s;ides to be wounded. By the
vices which prevail in &s;ociety, our tran|quillity
<PB N="278" REF="285">
may be di&s;turbed, and our lives in
various ways embittered, while government
can give us no redre&s;s. Religion &s;upplies
the in&s;ufficiency of law, by &s;triking at the
root of tho&s;e di&s;orders which occa&s;ion &s;o
much mi&s;ery in the world. Its profe&s;&s;ed
&s;cope is to regulate, not actions alone, but
the temper and inclinations. By this means
it a&s;cends to the &s;ources of conduct; and
very ineffectual would the wi&s;e&s;t &s;y&s;tem of
legi&s;lation prove for the happine&s;s of man|kind,
if it did not derive aid from religion,
in &s;oftening the di&s;po&s;itions of men, and
checking many of tho&s;e evil pa&s;&s;ions to which
the influence of law cannot po&s;&s;ibly reach.</P>
<P>We are led to this reflection by the de|&s;cription
given in the context of charity,
that great principle in the Chri&s;tian &s;y&s;tem.
The Apo&s;tle places it in a variety of lights,
and under each of them, explains its opera|tion
by its internal effects; not by the actions
to which it gives ri&s;e, but by the di&s;po&s;itions
which it produces in the heart. He ju&s;tly
&s;uppo&s;es, that if the temper be duly regu|lated,
propriety of action will follow, and
<PB N="279" REF="286">
good order take place in external behaviour.
Of tho&s;e characters of charity I have cho&s;en
one for the &s;ubject of this di&s;cour&s;e, which
leads to the con&s;ideration of a virtue highly
important to us, both as Chri&s;tians, and as
members of &s;ociety. I &s;hall endeavour, fir&s;t,
to explain the temper here pointed out, by
&s;hewing what this de&s;cription of charity im|ports,
that <HI>it thinketh no evil;</HI> and then to
recommend &s;uch a di&s;po&s;ition, and to di&s;|play
the bad effects of an oppo&s;ite turn of
mind.</P>
<P>I. LET us con&s;ider what this de&s;cription
of charity imports. You will ea&s;ily perceive
that the expre&s;&s;ion in the text is not to be
under&s;tood in a &s;en&s;e altogether unlimited;
as if there were no occa&s;ion on which we
are to think unfavourably of others. To
view all the actions of men with the &s;ame
degree of complacency, would be contrary
both to common under&s;tanding, and to
many expre&s;s precepts of religion. In a
word, where &s;o much depravity abounds,
were we to think and &s;peak equally well of
<PB N="280" REF="287">
all, we mu&s;t either be in&s;en&s;ible of the di&s;|tinction
between right and wrong, or be
indifferent to that di&s;tinction when we per|ceived
it. Religion renders it our duty to
<HI>abhor that which is evil;</HI> and, on many oc|ca&s;ions,
to expre&s;s our indignation openly
again&s;t it. But the Apo&s;tle, with great pro|priety,
de&s;cribes the temper which he is re|commending
in &s;uch &s;trong an general
terms$, as might guard us again&s;t that ex|treme
to which we are naturally mo&s;t prone,
of ra&s;h and unju&s;t &s;u&s;picion. The virtue
which he means to inculcate is that which
is known by the name of Candour; a vir|tue,
which, as &s;oon as it is mentioned,
every one will acknowledge to be e&s;&s;ential
to the character of a worthy man; a virtue
which we &s;eldom fail of a&s;cribing to any
per&s;on whom we &s;eek to recommend to the
e&s;teem of others; but which, I am afraid,
when we examine our own conduct in a
religious view. religious view, is &s;eldom the &s;ubject of in|quiry.</P>
<P>It is nece&s;&s;ary to ob&s;erve, that true can|dour
is altogether different from that guard|ed,
<PB N="281" REF="288">
inoffen&s;ive language, and that &s;tudied
openne&s;s of behaviour, which we &s;o fre|quently
meet with among men of the world.
Smiling, very often, is the a&s;pect, and
&s;mooth are the words of tho&s;e who in|wardly
are the mo&s;t ready to think evil of
others. That candour which is a Chri&s;tian
virtue con&s;i&s;ts, not in fairne&s;s of &s;peech,
but in fairne&s;s of heart. It may want the
blandi&s;hment of external courte&s;y, but &s;up|plies
its place with humane and generous
liberality of &s;entiment. Its manners are
unaffected, and its profe&s;&s;ions cordial.
Exempt, on one hand, from the dark jea|lou&s;y
of a &s;u&s;picious mind; it is no le&s;s
removed, on the other, from that ea&s;y cre|dulity
which is impo&s;ed on by every &s;pe|cious
pretence. It is perfectly con&s;i&s;tent
with exten&s;ive knowledge of the world,
and with due attention to our own &s;afety.
In that various intercour&s;e which we are
obliged to carry on with per&s;ons of every
different character, &s;u&s;picion, to a certain
degree, is a nece&s;&s;ary guard. It is only
when it exceeds the bounds of prudent cau|tion,
<PB N="282" REF="289">
that it degenerates into vice. There is
a proper mean between undi&s;tingui&s;hing
credulity, and univer&s;al jealou&s;y, which a
&s;ound under&s;tanding di&s;cerns, and which
the man of candour &s;tudies to pre&s;erve.</P>
<P>He makes allowance for the mixture of
evil with good, which is to be found in every
human character. He expects none to be
faultle&s;s; and he is unwilling to believe that
there is any without &s;ome commendable
quality. In the mid&s;t of many defects, he
can di&s;cover a virtue. In the mid&s;t of per|&s;onal
re&s;entment, he can be ju&s;t to the me|rit
of an enemy. He never lends an open
ear to tho&s;e defamatory reports and dark
&s;ugge&s;tions, which, among the tribes of
the cen&s;orious, circulate with &s;o much ra|pidity,
and meet with &s;uch ready acceptance.
He is not ha&s;ty to judge; and he requires
full evidence before he will condemn. As
long as an action can be a&s;cribed to different
motives, he holds it as no mark of &s;agacity
to impute it always to the wor&s;t. Where
there is ju&s;t ground for doubt, he keeps his
judgment undecided; and during the pe|riod
<PB N="283" REF="290">
of &s;u&s;pence, leans to the mo&s;t chari|table
con&s;truction which an action can bear.
When he mu&s;t condemn, he condemns with
regret; and without tho&s;e aggravations
which the &s;everity of others adds to the
crime. He li&s;tens calmly to the apology
of the offender, and readily admits every
extenuating circum&s;tance which equity can
&s;ugge&s;t. How much &s;oever he may blame
the principles of any &s;ect or party, he ne|ver
confounds under one general cen&s;ure
all who belong to that party or &s;ect. He
charges them not with &s;uch con&s;equences
of their tenets, as they refu&s;e and di&s;avow.
From one wrong opinion, he does not in|fer
the &s;ubver&s;ion of all &s;ound principles;
nor from one bad action, conclude that all
regard to con&s;cience is overthrown. When
<HI>he beholds the mote in his brother's eye,</HI> he
remembers <HI>the beam in his own.</HI> He com|mi&s;erates
human frailty; and judges of
others according to the principles by which
he would think it rea&s;onable that they
&s;hould judge of him. In a word, he views
men and actions in the clear &s;un&s;hine of
<PB N="284" REF="291">
charity and good-nature; and not in that
dark and &s;ullen &s;hade which jealou&s;y and
party &s;pirit throw over all characters.&mdash;
Such being in general the &s;pirit of that
charity which <HI>thinketh no evil,</HI> I proceed,</P>
<P>II. To recommend, by various argu|ments,
this important branch of Chri&s;tian
virtue.</P>
<P>Let us begin with ob&s;erving what a ne|ce&s;&s;ary
requi&s;ite it is to the proper di&s;charge
of all the &s;ocial duties. I need not &s;pend
time in &s;howing that tho&s;e hold a very
high rank in the Chri&s;tian &s;y&s;tem. The
encomium which the Apo&s;tle in this chap|ter
be&s;tows upon charity, is alone &s;ufficient
to prove it. He places this grace at the
head of all the gifts, and endowments, which
can be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by man; and a&s;&s;ures us
that <HI>though we had all faith &s;o that we
could remove mountains,</HI> yet if we be de&s;ti|&s;tute
of charity, <HI>it will profit us nothing.</HI>
Accordingly, <HI>love, gentlene&s;s, meekne&s;s and
long &s;uffering,</HI> are enumerated as di&s;tin|gui&s;hing
<HI>fruits of the &s;pirit</HI> of Chri&s;t<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Galat. v 22, 23.</NOTE> But
<PB N="285" REF="292">
it is impo&s;&s;ible for &s;uch virtues as the&s;e to
find place in a brea&s;t, where the propen&s;ity
to think evil of others is predominant.
Charitable and candid thoughts of men are
the nece&s;&s;ary introduction to all good-will
and kindne&s;s. They form, if we may
&s;peak &s;o, the only climate in which love
can grow up, and flouri&s;h. A &s;u&s;picious
temper checks in the bud every kind affec|tion.
It hardens the heart, ad e&s;tranges
man from man. What friend&s;hip or gra|titude
can you expect form him, who views
all your conduct with di&s;tru&s;tful eyes, and
a&s;cribes every benefit you confer to artifice
and &s;tratagem? The utmo&s;t which you
can hope from one of this character, is
ju&s;tice in his dealings; nor even that can
you be a&s;&s;ured of; as the &s;u&s;picions to
which he is a prey will afford him frequent
pretexts for departing from truth, and for
defending him&s;elf with the &s;ame arms which
he conceives to be employed again&s;t him.
Unhappy will they be who are joined with
him by any clo&s;e connexion; expo&s;ed to
every malignant &s;u&s;picion which ari&s;es in
<PB N="286" REF="293">
his own mind, and to every unju&s;t &s;ugge|&s;tion
which the malice of other may in&s;i|nuate
again&s;t them. That &s;tore of poi&s;on
which is collected within him frequently
throws out its venom on all who are within
its reach. As a companion, he will be &s;e|vere
and &s;atirical; as a friend, captious and
dangerous; in him dome&s;tic &s;phere, har&s;h,
jealous and ira&s;cible; in his civil capacity,
&s;editious and turboulent, prone to impute
the conduct of his &s;uperiours to improper
motives, and upon loo&s;e information to
condemn their conduct.</P>
<P>The contrary of all this may be expected
from a candid temper. Whatever is ami|able
in manners, or u&s;eful in &s;ociety, na|trually
and ea&s;ily ingrafts it&s;elf upon it.
Gentlene&s;s, humanity and compa&s;&s;ion flow
from it, as their native &s;pring. Open and
cheerful in it&s;elf, it diffu&s;es cheerfulne&s;s and
good-humour over all who are under its
influence. It is the chief ground of mu|tual
confidence and union among men.
It prevents tho&s;e animo&s;ities from ari&s;ing
which are the offspring of groundle&s;s pre|judice;
<PB N="287" REF="294">
or, by its bening interpo&s;ition, al|lays
them when ari&s;en. In the magi&s;trate,
it tempers ju&s;tice with lenity. Among
&s;ubjects it promotes good order and &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion.
It connects humanity with piety.
For he who is not given to think evil of
his fellow-creatures, will not be ready to
cen&s;ure the di&s;pen&s;ations of his Creator.
Whereas the &s;ame turn of mind which ren|ders
one jealous and unju&s;t towards men,
will incline him to be querulous and impi|ous
towards God.</P>
<P>In the &s;econd place, as a &s;u&s;picious, un|charitable
&s;pirit is incon&s;i&s;tent with all
&s;ocial virtue and happine&s;s, &s;o, in it&s;elf,
it is unrea&s;onable and unju&s;t. In order to
form &s;ound opinions concerning characters
and actions, two things are e&s;pecially re|qui&s;ite,
information and impartiality. But
&s;uch as are mo&s;t forward to decide unfa|vourably,
are commonly de&s;titute of both.
In&s;tead of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing, or even requiring, full
information, the grounds on which they
proceed are frequently the mo&s;t &s;light and
<PB N="288" REF="295">
frivolous. A tale, perhaps, which the idle
have invented, the inqui&s;itive have li&s;tened
to, and the credulous have propagated; or
a real incident which rumour, in carrying
it along, has exaggerated and di&s;gui&s;ed,
&s;upplies them with materials of confident
a&s;&s;ertion, and deci&s;ive judgment. From an
action they pre&s;ently look into the heart,
and infer the motive. This &s;uppo&s;ed mo|tive,
they conclude to be the ruling prin|ciple;
and pronounce at once concerning
the whole character.</P>
<P>Nothing can be more contrary both to
equity and to &s;ound rea&s;on, than &s;uch pre|cipitate
judgments. Any man who attends
to what pa&s;&s;es within him&s;elf, may ea&s;ily
di&s;cern what a complicated &s;y&s;tem the hu|man
character is, and what a variety of
circum&s;tances mu&s;t be taken into the ac|count,
in order to e&s;timate it truly. No
&s;ingle in&s;tance of conduct whatever, is &s;uf|ficient
to determine it. As from one wor|thy
action, it were credulity, not charity,
to conclude a per&s;on to be free from all
vice; &s;o from one which is cen&s;urable, it
<PB N="289" REF="296">
is perfectly unju&s;t to infer that the author
of it is without con&s;cience, and without me|rit.
Did you know all the attending cir|cum&s;tances,
it might appear in an excu&s;able
light; nay, perhaps, under a commendable
form. The motives of the actor may have
been entirely different from tho&s;e which
you a&s;cribe to him; and where you &s;uppo&s;e
him impelled by bad de&s;ign, he may have
been prompted by con&s;cience and mi&s;taken
principle. Admitting the action to have
been in every view criminal, he may have
been hurried into it through inadvertency
and &s;urpri&s;e. He may have &s;incerely re|pented;
and the virtuous principle may
have now regained its full vigour. Perhaps
this was the corner of frailty; the quarter
on which he lay open to the incur&s;ions of
temptation; while the other avenues of his
heart were firmly guarded by con&s;cience.</P>
<P>No error is more palpable than to look
for uniformity from human nature; though
it is commonly on this &s;uppo&s;ition that our
general conclu&s;ions concerning character are
formed. Mankind are con&s;i&s;tent neither in
<PB N="290" REF="297">
good, nor in evil. In the pre&s;ent &s;tate of
frailty, all is mixed and blended. The &s;tronge&s;t
contrarieties of piety and hypo|cri&s;y,
of genero&s;ity and avarice, of truth
and duplicity, often meet in one character.
The pure&s;t human virtue is con&s;i&s;tent with
&s;ome vice; and in the mid&s;t of much vice
and di&s;order, amiable, nay re&s;pectable, qua|lities
may be found. There are few ca&s;es
in which we have ground to conclude that
all goodne&s;s is lo&s;t. At the bottom of the
character there may lie &s;ome &s;parks of piety
and virtue, &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, but not extingui&s;h|ed;
which kept alive by the breath of hea|ven,
and gathering &s;trength in &s;ecret from
reflection, may, on the fir&s;t favourable
opening which is afforded them, be ready
to break forth with &s;plendour and force.&mdash;
Placed, then, in a &s;ituation of &s;o much un|certainty
and darkne&s;s, where our know|ledge
of the heart and characters of men is
&s;o limited, and our judgments concerning
them are &s;o apt to err, what a continual
call do we receive either to &s;u&s;pend our
judgment, or to give it on the favourable
<PB N="291" REF="298">
&s;ide? e&s;pecially when we con&s;ider that, as
through imperfect information we are un|qualified
for deciding &s;oundly, &s;o through
want of impartiality we are often tempted
to decide wrong. How much this enforces
the argument for candour, will appear by
con&s;idering,</P>
<P>IN the third place, what the &s;ources are
of tho&s;e &s;evere and uncharitable opinions
which we are &s;o ready to form. Were the
mind altogether free from prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion and
bias, it might avail it&s;elf to more advan|tage
of the &s;canty knowledge which it po&s;|e&s;&s;es.
But this is &s;o far from being the
ca&s;e, that on every &s;ide we are encumbered
with prejudices, and warped by pa&s;&s;ions,
which exert their influence in nothing more
than in leading us to think evil of others.
At all times we are ju&s;tly &s;aid to <HI>&s;ee through
a gla&s;s, darkly;</HI> but pa&s;&s;ion and prejudice,
looking through a gla&s;s which di&s;torts the
form of the objects, make us al&s;o &s;ee fal&s;ely.</P>
<P>It is one of the misfortunes of our pre&s;ent
&s;ituation, that &s;ome of the good di&s;po&s;itions
<PB N="292" REF="299">
of human nature are apt to betray us into
frailties and vices. Thus, it often happens
that the laudable attachment which we con|tract
for the country, or the church, to
which we belong, or for &s;ome political de|nomination
under which we cla&s;s our&s;elve$,
both confines our affections within too nar|row
a &s;phere, and gives ri&s;e to violent
prejudices again&s;t &s;uch as come under an
oppo&s;ite de&s;cription. Not contented with
being in the right our&s;elves, we mu&s;t find
all others in the wrong. We claim an ex|clu&s;ive
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of goodne&s;s and wi&s;dom;
and from approving warmly of tho&s;e who
join us, we proceed to condemn, with much
acrimony, not the principles only, but the
characters of tho&s;e from whom we differ.
Hence per&s;ons of well-di&s;po&s;ed minds are
too often, through the &s;trength of partial
good affection, involved in the crime of
uncharitable judgment. They ra&s;hly extend
to every individual the &s;evere opinion
which they have unwarrantably conceived
of the whole body.&mdash;This man is of a party
who&s;e principles we reckon &s;lavi&s;h; and
<PB N="293" REF="300">
therefore his whole &s;entiments are corrupted.
That man belongs to a religious fee$, which
we are accu&s;t$med to deem bigetted; and
therefore he is incapable of any generous
or liberal thought. Another is connected
with &s;ect, which we have been taught to
account relaxed; and therefore he can have
no &s;anctity.&mdash;Are the&s;e the judgments of
candour and charity? Is true piety or
virtue &s;o very limited in its nature, as to be
confined to &s;uch alone as &s;ee every thing
with our eyes, and follow exactly the train
of our ideas? Was there ever any great
community &s;o corrupt as not to include
within it individuals of real worth?</P>
<P>Be&s;ides prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of this nature, which
&s;ometimes mi&s;lead the hone&s;t mind, there
are other, and much more culpable cau&s;es
of uncharitable judgment. Pride is hurt
and wounded by every excellence in which
it can claim no &s;hare; and from eagerne&s;s
to di&s;cover a blemi&s;h, re&s;ts upon the &s;light|e&s;t
appearance of one, as a &s;atisfying proof.
When rivalry and competition concur with
pride, our de&s;ire to e&s;py defects increa&s;es,
<PB N="294" REF="301">
and, by con&s;equence, the grounds of cen&s;ure
multiply. Where no oppo&s;ition of intere&s;ts
takes place, envy has too much influence
in warping the judgment of many. Even
when none of the&s;e cau&s;es operate, the in|ward
con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of depravity is &s;ufficient
to fill the mind with evil thoughts of others.
Whence &s;hould a man &s;o readily draw his
opinions of men as from that character with
which he is be&s;t acquainted becau&s;e it is
his own? A per&s;on of low and ba&s;e mind
naturally imputes to others the &s;entiments
which he finds congenial to him&s;elf; and is
incredulous of every excellency which to
him is totally unknown. He enjoys, be|&s;ides,
con&s;olation in the thought that others
are no better than him&s;elf; that his weak|ne&s;&s;es
and crimes are tho&s;e of all men; and
that &s;uch as appear mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed for
virtue po&s;&s;e&s;s no real &s;uperiority, except
greater dexterity in concealing their vices.
Soothing them&s;elves with this doctrine in
&s;ecret, too many fo&s;ter and &s;trengthen the
bad opinion which they entertain of all
mankind. Rarely, if ever, have you ground
<PB N="295" REF="302">
to think well of that man's heart who is
on every occa&s;ion given to think the wor&s;t
of others. Let us ob&s;erve,</P>
<P>IN the fourth place, that &s;uitable to the
&s;ources whence a jealous and &s;u&s;picious tem|per
proceeds, are the effects which it pro|duces
in the world, the crimes and mi&s;chiefs
with which if fills &s;ociety. It po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es this
unhappy di&s;tinction beyond the other fail|ings
of the huan heart, that while it im|pels
men to violent deeds, it ju&s;tifies to their
own apprehen&s;ion the exce&s;&s;es which they
commit. Amid&s;t the uproar of other bad
pa&s;&s;ions, con&s;cience acts as a re&s;training
power. As &s;oon as the tumult &s;ub&s;ides, re|mor&s;e
exerts its influence, and renders the
&s;inner &s;en&s;ible of the evil which he has done.
But the uncharitable man is unfortunately
&s;et loo&s;e from any &s;uch check or controul.
Through the infatuation of prejudice, his
judgment is perverted; con&s;cience is mi&s;led;
<HI>the light within him is turned into darkne&s;s.</HI>
Viewing the objects of his di&s;plea&s;ure as evil
men, he thinks him&s;elf entitled to give that
<PB N="296" REF="303">
di&s;plea&s;ure full vent; and in committing
the mo&s;t inhuman actions, may &s;ometimes
imagine that he is doing good &s;ervice to
God.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t fruits of an evil-thinking &s;pirit
are calumny and di&s;traction, by which &s;o|ciety
is &s;o often embroiled, and men are &s;et
at variance with one another. But did it pro|ceed
no farther than cen&s;orious &s;peech, the
mi&s;chief would be le&s;s. Much greater and
more &s;erious evils frequently en&s;ue. What
direful effects, for in&s;tance, have often flow|ed
from ra&s;h and ill-&s;ounded jealou&s;y in
private life? No &s;ooner has one allowed
that daemon to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his mind,
than it perverts his under&s;tanding, and taints
all his faculties. Haunting him by night
and by day, bringing perpetually before
him the odious and di&s;quieting forms which
it has rai&s;ed up, it blackens every appear|ance
to his view; gives to trifles which
are in them&s;elves light as air, the weight of
full confirmation; till what was at fir&s;t a
dabious &s;urmi&s;e or a &s;light di&s;plea&s;ure, ri&s;es
at length into full belief and implacable
<PB N="297" REF="304">
fury. Hence, families torn with the mo&s;t
violent convul&s;ions; the hu&s;band armed
again&s;t the wi&s;e, the father again&s;t the &s;on,
the friend again&s;t the friend; the plan of
treachery and a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination contrived, and
the dagger plunged into the bo&s;om of the
innocent.&mdash;In public life, how often have
kingdom; been &s;haken with all the violence
of war and rebellion, from the unju&s;t &s;u&s;|picions
which &s;ubjects had conceived of
their rulers; or the ra&s;h jealou&s;y which
princes had entertained of their people?&mdash;
But it is in religious di&s;&s;en&s;ions chiefly, that
the mi&s;chievous power of uncharitable pre|judice
has di&s;played its full atrocity. Re|ligion
is always found to heighten every
pa&s;&s;ion on which it acts, and to render
every conte&s;t into which it enters, uncom|monly
ardent; becau&s;e the objects which it
pre&s;ents are of &s;uch a nature as &s;trongly to
&s;eize and engage the human mind. When
zeal for their own principles has prompted
men to view tho&s;e of a different per&s;ua&s;ion
in the odious lights which bigotry &s;ugge&s;ts,
every &s;entiment of humanity has too often
<PB N="298" REF="305">
been extingui&s;hed. The mild influence of
that religion which breathes nothing but
gentlene&s;s, has proved too feeble to re&s;train
the violent and bloody hand of per&s;ecution;
and the uncharitable &s;pirit, raging among
contending parties, has filled the world with
&s;uch calamities and crimes as have brought
di&s;grace on the Chri&s;tian name.</P>
<P>Let us attend particularly to one awful
in&s;tance of the guilt which men may con|tract,
and of the ruin which they may bring
upon them&s;elves, through the want of fair|ne&s;s
and candour. The nation of the Jews
were always noted for a narrow and un|charitable
&s;pirit. When John the Bapti&s;t,
and our ble&s;&s;ed Lord, appeared among them,
becau&s;e the former was au&s;tere in his tem|per
and retired in his life, they pronounced
of him that he had an evil &s;pirit: And be|cau&s;e
the latter was open and &s;ociable in his
manners, they held him to be de&s;titute of
that &s;anctity which became a prophet. Their
prejudice again&s;t our Lord took its fir&s;t ri&s;e
from a mo&s;t frivolous and contemptible cau&s;e.
<HI>Is not this the &s;on of the carpenter? Can any
<PB N="299" REF="306">
good thing come out of Nazareth?</HI> When his
miracles repelled this reproach, and &s;uffi|ciently
proved the eminence of his character,
&s;till they fo&s;tered their prejudices by this
mo&s;t futile rea&s;oning, <HI>Have any of the rulers
believed on him?</HI> Ob&s;tinate in their attach|ment
to a temporal Me&s;&s;iah, and continuing
to view all our Saviour's conduct with an
evil eye, when he conver&s;ed with bad men
in order to reclaim them, they treated him
as a <HI>companion of publicans and &s;inners.</HI> Be|cau&s;e
he di&s;allowed their groundle&s;s tradi|tions,
they held him to be a breaker of the
Sabbath, and a contemner of religion. Be|cau&s;e
he prophe&s;ied the de&s;truction of their
temple, they accu&s;ed him of being an enemy
to his own nation. Till at la&s;t, through
their perpetual mi&s;con&s;truction of his ac|tions,
their pa&s;&s;ions became &s;o inflamed as
to make them cry out with one voice, <HI>Away
with this man to the death and give us Ba|rabbas
the robber.</HI>&mdash;Viewing in this dread|ful
event the con&s;equences of want of can|dour,
let every man trouble to think evil
ra&s;hly of his brother. No one can tell how
<PB N="300" REF="307">
far uncharitable prejudice, may carry him
in guilt, if he allow, them to harbour and
gather &s;trength within his brea&s;t. The
cloud which <HI>ro&s;e from the &s;ea, no bigger than
a man's hand,</HI> may &s;oon &s;well and &s;pread, till
it cover the whole horizon, and di&s;charge
with mo&s;t de&s;tructive violence the gathered
&s;torm.</P>
<P>IN the fifth place, as a &s;u&s;picious &s;pirit
is the &s;ource of &s;o many crimes and cala|mities
in the world, &s;o it is the &s;pring of
certain mi&s;ery to the per&s;on who indulges
it. His friends will be few; and &s;mall will
be his comfort in tho&s;e whom he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es.
Believing others to be his enemies, he will
of cour&s;e make them &s;uch. Let his caution
be ever &s;o great, the a&s;perity of his thoughts
will often break out in his behaviour; and
in return for &s;u&s;pecting and hating, he will
incur &s;u&s;picion and hatred. Be&s;ides the ex|ternal
evils which he draws upon him&s;elf,
ari&s;ing from alienated friend&s;hip, broken
confidence, and open enmity; the &s;u&s;picious
temper it&s;elf is one of the wor&s;t evils which
<PB N="301" REF="308">
any man can &s;a$fer. If <HI>in all f$ar there be
torment,</HI> how mi$irable mu&s;t be his &s;tate who,
by living in perpetual jealou&s;y, lives in per|petual
dread? Looking upon him&s;elf to be
&s;urrounded with $$ies, enemies, and de&s;ign|ing
men, he is a &s;tranger to reliance and
tru&s;t. He knows not to whom to open
him&s;elf. He dre&s;&s;es his countenance in
forced &s;miles while his heart throbs within
from apprehen&s;ions of &s;ecret treachery.
Hence fretfulne&s;s and ill-humour, di&s;gu&s;t
at the world, and all the painful &s;en&s;ations
of an irritated and embittered mind.</P>
<P>So numerous and great are the evils ari&s;ing
from a &s;u&s;picious di&s;po&s;ition, that of the two
extremes it is more eligible to expo&s;e our|&s;elves
to occa&s;ional di&s;advantage fro think|ing
too well of others, than to &s;uffer con|tinual
mi&s;ery by thinking always ill of them.
It is better to be &s;ometimes impo&s;ed upon,
than never to tru&s;t. Safety is purcha&s;ed at
too dear a rate, when, in order to &s;ecure it,
we are obliged to be always clad in armour,
and to live in perpetual ho&s;tility with our
fellows. This is, for the &s;ake of living, to
<PB N="302" REF="309">
deprive our&s;elves of the comfort of life.
The man of candour enjoys his &s;ituation,
whatever it is, with cheerfulne&s;s and peace.
Prudence directs his intercour&s;e with the
world; but no black &s;u&s;picions haunt his
hours of re&s;t. Accu&s;tomed to view the cha|racters
of his neighbours in the mo&s;t fa|vourable
light, he is like one who dwells
amid&s;t tho&s;e beautiful &s;cenes of nature, on
which the eye re&s;ts with plea&s;ure. Whereas
the &s;u&s;picious man, having his imagination
filled with all the &s;hocking forms of human
fal&s;ehood, deceit, and treachery, re&s;embles
the traveller in the wilderne&s;s, who di&s;cerns
no objects around him but what are either
dreary or terrible; caverns that open &s;er|pents
that hi&s;s, and bea&s;ts of prey that howl.
Hence in him are verified tho&s;e de&s;criptions
which the Spirit of God has given us of
the mi&s;ery of the wicked. <HI>They &s;hall have
no peace. They &s;hall be like the troubled &s;ea
when it cannot re&s;t. The Lord &s;hall give
them a trembling heart, and failing of eyes,
and &s;orrow of mind: And they &s;hall fear day
and night, and have none a&s;&s;urance of heart.</HI>
I add,
<PB N="303" REF="310">
IN the &s;ixth and la&s;t place, that there is
nothing which expo&s;es men in a more
marked and direct manner to the di&s;plea|&s;ure
of the Almighty, than a malignant and
cen&s;orious &s;pirit. I in&s;i&s;t not now on the
general denunciations of divine wrath again&s;t
malice and hatred. Let us only con&s;ider
under what particular de&s;cription the Spirit
of God brings this crime of uncharitable
judgment. It is declared to be an impious
inva&s;ion of the prerogative of God, to whom
alone it belongs to &s;earch all hearts, and to
determine concerning all characters. This
privilege He often appropriates expre&s;sly to
him&s;elf, on purpo&s;e to re&s;train the ra&s;hne&s;s
of cen&s;ure among men; requiring us to
leave the judging of others to Him, and to
attend, each of us, to our own bu&s;ine&s;s and
duty. <HI>Who art thou that judge&s;t another man's
&s;ervant? To his own ma&s;ter, he &s;tandeth or
falleth. Judge nothing before the time; until
the Lord come, who &s;hall make manife&s;t the
coun&s;els of the heart</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Rom. xiv. 4. 1 Corinth. iv. 5.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>It de&s;erves our mo&s;t &s;erious attention, that,
in &s;everal pa&s;&s;ages of Scripture, the great
<PB N="304" REF="311">
Judge of the world is repre&s;ented, at the
day of final retribution, as proceeding upon
this principle, of redering to men according
to the manner in which they have acted
towards their brethren. <HI>With the merciful,
thou wilt &s;how thy&s;elf merciful; and with
the froward, thou wilt &s;how thy&s;elf froward.
With what judgment ye judge, ye &s;hall be
judged; and with what mea&s;ure ye mete, it
&s;hall be mea&s;ured to you again</HI><NOTE N="dagger;" PLACE="foot">P&s;alm xviii. 25, 26. Matth. vii. z.</NOTE>. It is im|po&s;&s;ible
to form an argument of more force
than this, to re&s;train all &s;everity of judgment
among &s;uch as look forward to the tribunal
of God. The argument extends not in|deed
&s;o far, as to repre&s;ent our acceptance
with the Deity as entirely &s;u&s;pended upon
the candour which we &s;how in forming our
&s;entiments of others. We know that other
graces be&s;ides this are requi&s;ite in order to
fit us for heaven; and that without piety
towards God, and faith in the Lord Je&s;us
Chri&s;t, all our charity to men will be found
defective and vain. But this we know
al&s;o, that in the heart which is de&s;titute of
<PB N="305" REF="312">
fairne&s;s and candour, the Spirit of God
certainly dwells not; and that whatever
appearances of religion the uncharitable man
may a&s;&s;ume, on him the Sovereign of the
univer&s;e looks with no favour.&mdash;Thou
who art a man full of frailties, who &s;tande&s;t
in need, not merely of impartiality in thy
divine Judge, but of indulgence and mercy;
Thou who implore&s;t daily this mercy from
him, and praye&s;t that He would <HI>remember
thou art du&s;t,</HI> and not be &s;trict to <HI>mark ini|quity
again&s;t thee;</HI> dare&s;t thou, with tho&s;e
very prayers in thy mouth, proceed to judge
without candour of thy brethren, and upon
the &s;lighte&s;t grounds to reprobate and con|demn
them? O thou hypocrite! (for by
what other name can we call thee?) vain
are all thy preten&s;ions to piety. Ineffectual
is every plea which thou can&s;t from for
mercy from heaven. The precedent which
thou ha&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hed again&s;t thy&s;elf is de|ci&s;ive.
Thou ha&s;t dictated the &s;entence of
thine own condemnation.</P>
<P>ON the whole, it clearly appears that no
part of the government of temper de&s;erves

attention more, than to keep our minds pure
from uncharitable prejudices, and open to
candour and humanity in judging of others.
The wor&s;t con&s;equences, both to our&s;elves
and to &s;ociety, follow from the oppo&s;ite
&s;pirit. Let us beware of encouraging a habit
of &s;u&s;picion, by forming too &s;evere and har&s;h
opinions concerning human nature in gene|ral.
A great proportion of infirmity and
corruption, doubtle&s;s adheres to it; yet
tempered al&s;o it is with various mixtures of
virtue and good affection. Darkened as the
divine image now is among mankind, it is
not wholly effaced. Much piety and good|ne&s;s
may lie hidden in hearts that are un|known
to us. Vice is glaring and loud.
The crimes of the wicked make a noi&s;e in
the world, and alarm &s;ociety. True worth
is retired and mode&s;t, and requires parti|cular
&s;ituations to bring it forth to public
notice. The prophet Elijah, in a time of
prevailing corruption, imagined that all true
religion had for&s;aken the land. <HI>I, even I
only,</HI> &s;aid he to the Lord, <HI>am left to &s;erve
thee.</HI> But the Almighty, who di&s;cerned
<PB N="307" REF="314">
what was concealed from his imperfect view,
replied, <HI>Yet have I left me &s;even thou&s;and
men in I&s;rael who have not bowed the knee to
Baal</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">1 Kings xix. 14. 18.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The aged, and the unfortunate, who have
toiled through an un&s;ucce&s;sful life with long
experience of the fal&s;ehood and fraud of evil
men, are apt to be the mo&s;t &s;evere in the
opinions which they entertain of others.
For &s;uch, their circum&s;tances may be al|lowod
to form &s;ome degree of apology. But
if, in youth and pro&s;perity, the &s;ame hard
&s;u&s;picious &s;pirit prevail; if they who are
beginning the career of life &s;et out with all
the &s;cruples of di&s;tru&s;t; if, before they have
had rea&s;on to complain of the world, they
betray the diffidence of a jealous, and the
malignity of a cen&s;orious mind &s;ad is the
pre&s;age which may thence be drawn of their
future di&s;honour. From &s;uch, you have
nothing to look for that &s;hall be either en|gaging
in private life, or re&s;pectable in pub|lic
character. To youth it particularly be|longs
to be generous in &s;entiment, candid
<PB N="308" REF="315">
in opinion, unde&s;igning in behaviour, open
to the mo&s;t favourable con&s;truction of ac|tions

&s;tages of life, candour and fairne&s;s is one of
the mo&s;t honourable di&s;tinctions of the hu|man
character. It is connected with mag|nanimity;
it is ju&s;tified by wi&s;dom; it is
&s;uitable to the relation in which we &s;tand to
one another. But if rea&s;on and humanity
be in&s;ufficient to re&s;train us from ra&s;h and
uncharitable judgments, let that awful de|nunciation
frequently re&s;ound in our ears,
<HI>He &s;hall have judgment without mercy who

<Q>Now therefore be not grieved nor angry with

<P>IN this generous manner,<NOTE PLACE="marg">SERM. XI.</NOTE> Jo&s;eph frames
an apology for the unnatural behaviour
of his brethren. He extenuates the atro|city
of their crime, by repre&s;enting the happy
effects which it had produced. He looks
beyond all &s;econd cau&s;es; and recognizes,
in the wonderful events of his life, the hand
of the Almighty.&mdash;No human character
<PB N="310" REF="317">
exhibited in the records of Scripture is more
remarkable, or in&s;tructive, than that of this
patriarch. He is one whom we behold
tried in all the vici&s;&s;itudes of fortune; from
the condition of a &s;lave, ri&s;ing to be ruler of
the land of Egypt; and in every &s;tation
acquiring, by his virtue and wi&s;dom, favour
with God and man. When over&s;&s;eer $word$
Potiphar's hou&s;e, his fidelity was proved by
&s;trong temptations, which he honourably
re&s;i&s;ted. When thrown into pri&s;on by the
artifice of a fal&s;e woman, his integrity and
prudence &s;oon rendered him con&s;picuous,
even in that dark man&s;ion. When called
into the pre&s;ence of Pharaoh, the wi&s;e and
exten&s;ive plan which he formed for &s;aving
the kingdom from the mi&s;eries of impend|ing
famine, ju&s;tly rai&s;ed him to a high &s;ta|tion,
wherein his abilities were eminently
di&s;played in the public &s;ervice. But in his
whole hi&s;tory there is no circum&s;tance &s;o
&s;triking and intere&s;ting, as his behaviour to
his brethren who had &s;old him into &s;lavery.
The moment in which he made him&s;elf
known to them, that moment at which we
<PB N="311" REF="318">
are now to contemplate him, was the mo&s;t
critical one of his life and the mo&s;t deci&s;ive
of his character. It is &s;uch as rarely occurs
in the cour&s;e of human events; and is cal|culated
to draw the highe&s;t attention of all
who are endowed with any degree of &s;en|&s;ibility
of heart. Let us con&s;ider the &s;enti|ment
which Jo&s;eph utters in the text under
two views, each of which is very in&s;tructive
to all Chri&s;tians. I. As a di&s;covery of his
cordial forgivene&s;s of his brethren; and, II.
as an in&s;tance of his dutiful attention to the
Providence of God.</P>
<P>I. THE mo&s;t cordial forgivene&s;s is here
di&s;played. I &s;hall not recapitulate all the
preceding hi&s;tory re&s;pecting Jo&s;eph and his
brethren; as it is well known by every one
who has the lea&s;t acquaintance with the &s;a|cred
writings. From the whole tenour of
the narration it appears that though Jo|&s;eph,
upon the arrival of his brethren in
Egypt, made him&s;elf &s;trange to them, yet
from the beginning he intended to di&s;cover
him&s;elf; and &s;tudied &s;o to conduct the di&s;|covery
<PB N="312" REF="319">
as might render the &s;urpri&s;e of joy
complete. For this end, by affected &s;eve|rity,
he took mea&s;ures for bringing down
into Egypt all his father's children. They
were now arrived there; and Benjamin
among the re&s;t, who was his younger bro|ther
by the &s;ame mother, and was particu|larly
beloved by Jo&s;eph. Him he threat|ened
to detain; and &s;eemed willing to al|low
the re&s;t to depart. This incident re|newed
their di&s;tre&s;s. They all knew their
father's extreme anxiety about the &s;afety of
Benjain, and with what difficulty he had
yielded to his undertaking this journey.
Should he be prevented from returning,
they dreaded that grief would overpower
the old man's &s;pirits, and prove fatal to his
life. Judah, therefore, who had particu|larly
urged the nece&s;&s;ity of Benjamin's ac|companying
his brothers, and had &s;olemnly
pledged him&s;elf to their father for his &s;afe
return, craved, upon this occa&s;ion, an au|dience
of the governour; and gave him a
full account of the circum&s;tances of Jacob's
family.</P>
<P><PB N="313" REF="320">
Nothing can be more intere&s;ting and pa|thetic
than this di&s;cour&s;e of Judah, as it is
recorded in the preceding chapter. Little
knowing to whom he &s;poke, he paints, in
all the colours of &s;imple and natural elo|quence,
the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed &s;ituation of the aged
patriarch, ha&s;tening to the clo&s;e of life;
long afflicted for the lo&s;s of a favourite &s;on,
whom he &s;uppo&s;ed to have been torn in
pieces by a bea&s;t of prey; labouring now
under anxious concern about his younge&s;t
&s;on, the child of his old age, who alone
was left alive of his mother, and whom
nothing but the calamities of &s;evere famine
could have moved a tender father to &s;end
from home, and expo&s;e to the dangers of a
foreign land. <HI>If we bring him not back
with us, we &s;hall bring down the grey hairs
of thy &s;ervant our father, with &s;orrow, to the
grave. I pray thee therefore let thy &s;ervant
abide in&s;tead of the young man, a bondman to
our lord. For how &s;hall I go up to my fa|ther,
and Benjamin not with me? le&s;t I &s;ee
the evil that &s;hall come on my father.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="314" REF="321">
Upon this relation, Jo&s;eph could no
longer re&s;train him&s;elf. The tender ideas
of his father and his father's hou&s;e, of his
ancient home, his country and his kindred,
of the di&s;tre&s;s of his family, and his own ex|altation,
all ru&s;hed too &s;trongly upon his
mind to bear any farther concealment. <HI>He
cried, cau&s;e every man to go out from me;
and be wept aloud.</HI> The tears which he
&s;hed were not the tears of grief. They
were the bur&s;t of affection. They were the
effu&s;ions of a heart overflowing with all the
tender &s;en&s;ibilities of nature. Formerly he
had been moved in the &s;ame manner, when
he fir&s;t &s;aw his brethren before him. <HI>His
bowels yearned upon them; he &s;ought for a
place where to weep. He went into his
chamber; and then wa&s;hed his face, and re|turned
to them.</HI> At that period his gene|rous
plans were not completed. But now,
when there was no farther occa&s;ion for con|&s;training
him&s;elf, he gave free vent to the
&s;trong emotions of his heart. The fir&s;t
mini&s;ter to the king of Egypt was not
<PB N="315" REF="322">
a&s;hamed to &s;how, that he felt as a man, and
a brother. <HI>He wept aloud; and the Egyp|tians,
and the hou&s;e of Pharaoh heard him.</HI></P>
<P>The fir&s;t words which his &s;welling heart
allowed him to pronounce, are the mo&s;t
&s;uitable to &s;uch an affecting &s;ituation which
were ever uttered.&mdash;<HI>I am Jo&s;eph; doth my
father yet live?</HI>&mdash;What could he, what
ought he, in that impa&s;&s;ioned moment, to
have &s;aid more? This is the voice of na|ture
her&s;elf, &s;peaking her own language;
and it penetrates the heart: No pomp of
expre&s;&s;ion; no parade of kindne&s;s; but
&s;trong affection ha&s;tening to utter what it
&s;trongly felt. <HI>His brethren could not an|&s;wer
him; for they were troubled at his pre|&s;ence.</HI>
Their &s;ilence is as expre&s;&s;ive of tho&s;e
emotions of repentance, and &s;hame, which,
on this amazing di&s;covery, filled their
brea&s;ts, and &s;topped their utterance, as the
few words which Jo&s;eph &s;peaks are expre&s;|&s;ive
of the generous agitations which &s;trug|gled
for vent within him. No painter could
&s;eize a more &s;triking moment for di&s;playing
the characeri&s;tical features of the human
<PB N="316" REF="323">
heart, than what is here pre&s;ented. Never
was there a &s;ituation of more tender and
virtuous joy, on the one hand; nor, on
the other, of more overwhelming confu&s;ion
and con&s;cious guilt. In the &s;imp;e narra|tion
of the &s;acred hi&s;torian, it is &s;et before
us with greater energy and higher effect,
than if it had been wrought up with all the
colouring of the mo&s;t admired modern elo|quence.</P>
<P>When Jo&s;eph had a little recovered him|&s;elf
from the fir&s;t tran&s;ports of emotion, he
proceeds to explain his &s;ituation to his
brethren, and to &s;how them the beneficent
purpo&s;es for which he conceived him&s;elf to
be rai&s;ed by Providence into power. The
apology which he makes in the text for their
former cruelty is uncommon and remark|able.
<HI>Now therefore be not grieved nor an|gry
with your&s;elves that ye &s;old me hither;
for God did &s;end me before you to pre&s;erve you
a po&s;terity in the earth, and to &s;ave your lives
by a great deliverance. So now it was not
you that &s;ent me hither but God; and he
hath made me a father to Pharaoh, and Lord
<PB N="317" REF="324">
of all his hou&s;e, and a ruler throughout all the
land of Egypt.</HI> This apology was, in truth,
no &s;atisfactory excu&s;e for their crime. For
though the over-ruling providence of Hea|ven
had &s;o directed the cour&s;e of events, as
to render their bad intentions &s;ub&s;ervient to
a happy i&s;&s;ue; yet the badne&s;s of the inten|tion
originated entirely from them&s;elves.
The envy and jealou&s;y which they enter|tained
again&s;t their brother, led them to
the commi&s;&s;ion of an atrocious deed. The
deed was voluntary; the crime was all their
own; and the interpo&s;ition of Providence
in making unfore&s;een con&s;equences follow
from that crime, did not, could not, excul|pate
them from guilt. It were an impious
conclu&s;ion, that becau&s;e God extracts good
from our evil, we are not an&s;werable for
the evil which we perpetrate. <HI>God cannot
be tempted with evil, neither tempteth he any
man</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">James i. 13.</NOTE>. But the &s;entiment in the text is to
be con&s;idered, as a colour which the gene|rous
humanity of Jo&s;eph prompted him to
throw on the conduct of his brethren. He
<PB N="318" REF="325">
&s;aw the confu&s;ion with which they were
overwhelmed in his pre&s;ence. He diverts
their attention from the remembrance of a
crime which was now wringing their hearts
with angui&s;h, by repre&s;enting to them the
happy effects which that crime had pro|duced.
He &s;ets them free from all unea&s;i|ne&s;s
on his account. He calls upon them
to rejoice in his pro&s;perity and in&s;tead of
dwelling on a painful recollection of their
own conduct, to join with him in ac|knowledging
and adoring the hand of the
Almighty.</P>
<P>How different is this amiable &s;pirit which
Jo&s;eph di&s;covers, from that har&s;h and o&s;ten|tatious
&s;uperiority which too often accom|panies
the pretended forgivene&s;s of injuries,
among tho&s;e who call them&s;elves Chri&s;tians!
They are ready to &s;ay that, for their part,
they pardon the wrongs which have been
done them; they wi&s;h that the per&s;ons who
have committed them may be able to for|give
them&s;elves; they leave them to God
and to their own con&s;cience. By the &s;evere
&s;ugge&s;tion which they throw out, they
<PB N="319" REF="326">
di&s;cover the inward bitterne&s;s of their &s;pi|rit;
and artfully gratify re&s;entment, at the
time when they profe&s;s to exerci&s;e forgive|ne&s;s.
Whereas the great and good man
who&s;e character we now con&s;ider, effaces
all memory of the crimes which he par|dons.
He &s;eeks to alleviate the remor&s;e
of his brethren by an extenuation of their
guilt; and while he is preparing to make
their circum&s;tances comfortable, &s;tudies at
the &s;ame time to render their minds ea&s;y
and tranquil.</P>
<P>This was not merely a tran&s;ient emotion
with Jo&s;eph, owing to the fir&s;t bur&s;t of af|fection
on di&s;covering him&s;elf to his bre|thren.
We have a clear proof, from a re|markable
tran&s;action which pa&s;&s;ed many
years after this period, of his di&s;po&s;ition
continuing the &s;ame to the end of life. It
is recorded in the la&s;t chapter of this book,
that when Jacob died, his &s;ons began to be
&s;eized with fear concerning the treatment
which they might receive from their bro|ther.
The guilty are always &s;u&s;picious.
Con&s;cious of their own ba&s;ene&s;s, they are
<PB N="320" REF="327">
incapable of conceiving the magnanimity of
others. They &s;aw the bond which held
the family together, now broken by their
father's death. They dreaded that the re|&s;entment
of Jo&s;eph again&s;t them hand hi|therto
been only &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, or concealed.
<HI>They &s;aid among them&s;elves, peradventure he
will now hate us, and requite all the evil which
we did unto him.</HI> Under this apprehen&s;ion,
they fir&s;t &s;ent a humble me&s;&s;age to depre|cate
his di&s;plea&s;ure by the memory of thier
common father; and then appearing in his
pre&s;ence, they fell down before his face,
profe&s;&s;ing them&s;elves to be his &s;ervants, and
praying hi to forgive the tre&s;pa&s;s which
they had committed again&s;t him. But no
&s;uch hidden re&s;entment as they dreaded had
ever lurked in the &s;oul of Jo&s;eph. On the
contrary, when he beheld his brethren in
this affecting &s;ituation, bereaved of their
ancient protector, and reduced, as they
imagined, to the nece&s;&s;ity of holding up
their hands to him for mercy, he was over|powered
by a tide of tender emotions. <HI>Jo|&s;eph
wept, while his brethren &s;pake unto him.</HI>
<PB N="321" REF="328">
The&s;e affectionate tears alone were &s;ufficient
to have en&s;ured their forgivene&s;s. But ha|&s;tening
al&s;o by words to di&s;pel their alarms,
he pre&s;ently added, <HI>Fear not; for though ye
thought evil again&s;t me, God meant it unto
good. Now therefore fear ye not; I will
nouri&s;h you and your little ones. And he
comforted them; and &s;pake kindly unto them</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Gene&s;. 1. 21.</NOTE></P>
<P>Such was the la&s;t incident that is record|ed
in the life of this eminent per&s;onage,
than whom you will find few more di&s;tin|gui&s;hed
by an a&s;&s;emblage of illu&s;trious vir|tues;
in the lowe&s;t adver&s;ity, patient and
faithful; in the highe&s;t pro&s;perity, benefi|cent
and generous; dutiful and affectionate,
as a &s;on; kind and forgiving, as a brother;
accompli&s;hed as a &s;tate&s;man; wi&s;e and pro|vident,
as a ruler of the land. In &s;uch a
character you behold human nature po&s;&s;e&s;&s;|ing
its highe&s;t honours. The &s;entiments
which it in&s;pires, tend to ennoble our minds;
and to prevent their imbibing the &s;pirit of
tho&s;e hard, intere&s;ted, and &s;elf-&s;eeking men
with whom the world abounds.</P>
<P><PB N="322" REF="329">
THE &s;triking example of forgivene&s;s,
which the text di&s;plays, ought frequently
to occur to our thoughts amid&s;t the various
occa&s;ions of provocation and offence which
ari&s;e in our intercour&s;e with the world. If
one &s;o worthy and amiable, in the days too
of his youth and innocence, &s;uffered &s;uch
cruel treatment from his brothers, ought
we to be &s;urpri&s;ed if, even from our neare&s;t
relations, we meet with inju&s;tice or ingra|titude?
Wrongs and injuries are, more or
le&s;s, the portion of all. Like Death, they
are an evil unavoidable. No &s;tation is &s;o
high, no power &s;o great, no character &s;o
unblemi&s;hed, as to exempt us from them.
In the world, ungrateful men, fal&s;e friends,
and violent enemies abound. Every wi&s;e
man ought to prepare him&s;elf for what he
is to encounter, in pa&s;&s;ing through this
thorny region. He is not to expect that
he can <HI>gather grapes from thi&s;tles;</HI> nor to
lo&s;e the government of his mind, becau&s;e,
in the mid&s;t of evil men, he is not allowed
to remain, like a &s;acred and inviolable per|&s;on,
untouched and uninjured.</P>
<P><PB N="323" REF="330">
As this view of our &s;ituation ought to
blunt the edge of pa&s;&s;ion and impatience,
&s;o the alleviating circum&s;tances which rea|&s;on
will &s;ugge&s;t, ought to mollify re&s;ent|ment.
Think of the various con&s;tructions
which the actions of men will bear. Con|&s;ider
how different the motives of him who
hath given us offence, may have been from
tho&s;e which in the heat of pa&s;&s;ion we a&s;cribe
to him; how apt all men are to be &s;educed
by mi&s;taken views of intere&s;t; and how
little ground we have to complain it, upon
a &s;uppo&s;ed interfering of intere&s;ts, we &s;uffer
by others preferring their own to ours.
Remember that no opinions which you
form under the power of re&s;entment can
be depended upon as ju&s;t; and that every
one loads the intentions of his enemy with
imaginary degrees of malice.</P>
<P>But admitting the injury you have re|ceived
to be ever &s;o atrocious in its nature,
and aggravated in its circum&s;tances; &s;up|po&s;ing
it to be even parallel to that which
Jo&s;eph &s;uffered; look up, like him, to that
divine government under which we are all
<PB N="324" REF="331">
placed. If forgivene&s;s be a duty which
we know God to have required under the
mo&s;t awful &s;anctions, dare we draw upon
our&s;elves the merited vengeance of that &s;u|periour,
to who&s;e clemency we are obliged
daily to fly? When, with hard and unre|lenting
di&s;po&s;itions towards our brethren,
we &s;end up to Heaven prayers for mercy to
our&s;elves, tho&s;e prayers return like impre|cations
upon our heads; and our very de|votions
&s;eal our condemnation.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t plain and natural &s;entiment of
equity concur with divine authority to
enforce the duty which I now recommend.
Let him who has never in his life done
wrong, be allowed the privilege of re|maining
inexorable. But let &s;uch as are
con&s;cious of frailties and crimes, con&s;ider
forgivene&s;s as a debt which they owe to
others. Common failings are the &s;tronge&s;t
le&s;&s;on of mutual forbearance. Were this
virtue unknown among men, order and
comfort, peace and repo&s;e would be &s;tran|gers
to human life. Injuries retaliated ac|cording
to the exorbitant mea&s;ure which
<PB N="325" REF="332">
pa&s;&s;ion pre&s;cribes, would ju&s;tify re&s;entment
in return. The injured per&s;on would be|come
the injurer; and thus wrongs, reta|liations,
and fre&s;h injuries, would circulate
in endle&s;s &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, till the world was
rendered a field of blood. Of all the pa&s;|&s;ions
which invade the human brea&s;t, re|venge
is the mo&s;t direful. When allowed
to reign with full dominion, it is more than
&s;ufficient to poi&s;on the few plea&s;ures which
remain to man in his pre&s;ent &s;tate. How
much &s;oever a per&s;on may &s;uffer from in|ju&s;tice,
he is always in hazard of &s;uffering
more from the pro&s;ecution of revenge.
The violence of an enemy cannot inflict
what is equal to the torment he creates to
him&s;elf, by means of the fierce and de&s;perate
pa&s;&s;ions which he allows to rage in his
&s;oul.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e evil &s;pirits who inhabit the regions
of mi&s;ery, are repre&s;ented as delighting in
revenge and cruelty. But all that is great
and good in the univer&s;e, is on the &s;ide of
clemency and mercy. The almighty Ruler
of the world, though for ages offended by
<PB N="326" REF="333">
the unrighteou&s;ne&s;s, and in&s;ulted by the
impiety of men, is <HI>long &s;uffering and &s;low
to anger.</HI> His Son when he appeared in
our nature, exhibited both in his life and
his death, the mo&s;t illu&s;trious example of
forgivene&s;s which the world ever beheld.
If you look into the hi&s;tory of mankind,
you will find that in every age, tho&s;e who
have been re&s;pected as worthy, or admired
as great, have been di&s;tingui&s;hed for this
virtue. Revenge dwells in little minds.
A noble and magnanimous &s;pirit is always
&s;uperiour to it. It &s;uffers not from the inju|ries
of men tho&s;e &s;evere &s;hocks which others
feel. Collected within it&s;elf, it &s;tands un|moved
by their impotent a&s;&s;aults; and with
generous pity, rather than with anger, looks
down on their unworthy conduct. It has
been truly &s;aid, that the greate&s;t man on
earth can no &s;ooner commit an injury, than
a good man can make him&s;elf greater, by
forgiving it. Jo&s;eph, at the moment when
we now contemplate him, had entirely un|der
his power all tho&s;e unnatural brethren
who had been guilty towards him of the
<PB N="327" REF="334">
mo&s;t cruel outrage which men could per|petrate.
He could have retained them for
ever in that Egyptian bondage to which
they had once con&s;igned him; and have
gratified revenge by every accumulation of
di&s;grace which de&s;potic power enabled him
to inflict. Had he acted this part, he
might for a while have been &s;oothed by the
plea&s;ures of his high &s;tation. But remor&s;e,
in the end, would have &s;tung his &s;oul.
Cruelty would have rendered him unhappy
within him&s;elf, as well as odious to others:
And his name would have peri&s;hed among
the crowd of tho&s;e contemptible &s;tate&s;men,
who&s;e actions &s;tain the annals of hi&s;tory.
Whereas now, his character &s;tands among
the foremo&s;t in the ranks of &s;potle&s;s fame.
His memory is ble&s;&s;ed to all generations.
His example continues to edify the world;
and he him&s;elf &s;hines in the cele&s;tial re|gions
<HI>as the brightne&s;s of the firmament, and
as the &s;tars for ever and ever.</HI> Let us now,</P>
<P>II. CONSIDER the &s;entiment contained
in the text, not only as a di&s;covery of cor|dial
<PB N="328" REF="335">
forgivene&s;s, but as an expre&s;&s;ion of
devout attention to the conduct of Provi|dence.
<HI>So now it was not you that &s;ent me
hither, but God.</HI> Remark how beautifully
piety and humanity are, in this in&s;tance,
connected together. As we are told of
Cornelius, the good Centurion, that <HI>his
prayers and his alms,</HI> his devotion and his
good works, came up together <HI>in memorial
before God,</HI> &s;o here we perceive fraternal
affection and religious reverence, mingling
in one emotion within the patriarch's heart.
In a per&s;on of low and vulgar mind, the
&s;en&s;ations on &s;uch an occa&s;ion would have
been extremely different. Looking back
on the pa&s;t events of his life, he would
have a&s;cribed all the adver&s;ity which he had
&s;uffered, to the perver&s;e treatment of his
brothers; and all the pro&s;perity which he
afterwards attained, to his own good conduct
and wi&s;dom; and by con&s;equence would
have remained embittered again&s;t the in&s;tru|ments
of the one, and filled with pride and
&s;elf-&s;ufficiency on account of the other.
But the elevated and noble mind of Jo&s;eph
<PB N="329" REF="336">
rejected &s;uch unworthy &s;entiments. Con|templating
the hand of God in all that had
befallen him, he effaced the remembrance
of tho&s;e evil deeds which had produced his
adver&s;ity; and for his pro&s;perity he affect|ed
no prai&s;e to him&s;elf, but a&s;cribed it en|tirely
to the will of Heaven. Let us take
notice that this is not the reflection of a
private, retired man; who&s;e &s;ituation might
be &s;uppo&s;ed to favour &s;uch devout medita|tions.
It is the reflection of one, who was
leading a bu&s;y and a &s;educing life, in the
mid&s;t of a court; the favourite of the
greate&s;t monarch who was then known in
the world. Yet him you behold, amid&s;t
the &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion and adulation which was
paid to him, pre&s;erving the moderation and
&s;implicity of a virtuous mind; and amid&s;t
the idolatry and fal&s;e philo&s;ophy of the
Egyptians, maintaining the principles of true
religion, and giving glory to the God of
I&s;rael.</P>
<P>From this union of piety with humanity,
which is &s;o con&s;picuous in the &s;entiments of
Jo&s;eph, there ari&s;es one very important in|&s;truction;
<PB N="330" REF="337">
That a devout regard to the hand
of God in the various events of life tends
to promote good di&s;po&s;itions and affections
towards men. It will be found by tho&s;e
who attend to the workings of human na|ture,
that a great proportion of tho&s;e ma|lignant
pa&s;&s;ions which break out in the in|tercour&s;e
of men, ari&s;es from con&s;ining their
attention wholly to &s;econd cau&s;es, and over|looking
the fir&s;t cau&s;e of all. Hence, they
are in&s;olent in pro&s;perity, becau&s;e they di&s;|cern
nothing higher than their own abili|ties;
and in adver&s;ity they are peevi&s;h and
unforgiving, becau&s;e they have no object
on which to fix their view, but the conduct
of men who have acted as their enemies.
They behold no plan of wi&s;dom or goodne&s;s
carried on throughout nature, which can
allay the di&s;compo&s;ure of their mind. As
&s;oon as their temper is ruffled, the world
appears to them to be a continued &s;cene of
di&s;a&s;ters and injuries, of confu&s;ed events
and of unrea&s;onable men. Whereas to the
pious man, the contemplation of the uni|ver&s;e
exhibits a very different &s;pectacle. In
<PB N="331" REF="338">
the mid&s;t of &s;eeming confu&s;ion he traces a
principle of order; and by attention to that
order, his mind is harmonized and calmed.
He beholds a wi&s;e and righteous Governour
pre&s;iding over all the commotions which
are rai&s;ed by the tumult of conflicting pa&s;|&s;ions
and intere&s;ts; guiding, with imper|ceptible
influnce, the hand of the violent to
beneficent purpo&s;es; accompli&s;hing unex|pected
ends by the mo&s;t improbable means;
obliging the <HI>wrath of man to prai&s;e him;</HI>
&s;ometimes humbling the mighty, &s;ometimes
exalting the low; often <HI>&s;naring the wicked
in the devices which their hands have wrought.</HI>
Re&s;pectful acknowledgment of this divine
government, controuls the di&s;orders of infe|riour
pa&s;&s;ions. Reverence for the decrees
of Heaven in&s;pires patience and modera|tion.
Tru&s;t in that perfect wi&s;dom and
goodne&s;s which directs all for the be&s;t, di|mini&s;hes
the &s;hock which worldly di&s;a&s;ters
occa&s;ion. The irritation of pa&s;&s;ion and re|&s;entment,
will always bear proportion to the
agitation which we &s;uffer from the changes
of fortune. One who connects him&s;elf
<PB N="332" REF="339">
with nothing but &s;econd cau&s;es, partakes of
the violence and irregularity of all the in|feriour
movements belonging to this great
machine. He who refers all to God, dwells,
if we may &s;peak &s;o, in that higher &s;phere
where motion begins; he is &s;ubject to fewer
&s;hocks and concu&s;&s;ions, and is only carried
along by the motion of the univer&s;e.</P>
<P>How can mildne&s;s or forgivene&s;s gain
place in the temper of that man who, on
occa&s;ion of every calamity which he &s;uffers
from the ill u&s;age of others, has no &s;anctuary
within his own brea&s;t to which he can make
retreat from their vexations; who is po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed
of no principle which is of &s;ufficient
power to bear down the ri&s;ing tide of peevi&s;h
and angry pa&s;&s;ions? The violence of an
enemy, or the ingratitude of a friend, the
inju&s;tice of one man, and the treachery of
another, perpetually dwell and rankle in
his thoughts. The part which they have
acted in bringing on his di&s;tre&s;s is frequently
more grating to him than the di&s;tre&s;s it&s;elf.
Whereas he who in every event looks up to
God, has always in his view a great and ele|vating
<PB N="333" REF="340">
object, which in&s;pires him with mag|nanimity.
His mind lies open to every
relieving thought, and is inclined to every
&s;ugge&s;tion of genero&s;ity. He is di&s;po&s;ed to
&s;ay with Jo&s;eph, <HI>it was not you that &s;ent me
hither, but God;</HI> with David, <HI>it is the Lord;
let him do what &s;eemeth good in his eyes;</HI> and
with a greater per&s;onage than either of the&s;e,
<HI>the cup which my Father hath given me to
drink, &s;hall I not drink it?</HI> Hence ari&s;es
&s;uperiority to many of the ordinary provo|cations
of the world. For he looks upon
the whole of his pre&s;ent life as part of a
great plan, which is carried on under the
direction of Heaven. In this plan, he views
men as acting their &s;everal parts, and con|tributing
to his good or evil. But their
parts he con&s;iders as &s;ubordinate ones;
which, though they may ju&s;tly merit his
affection, and may occa&s;ionally call forth
his re&s;entment, yet afford no proper foun|dation
to violent or maligant pa&s;&s;ion. He
looks upon bad men as only the rod with
which the Almighty cha&s;tens; like the
pe&s;tilence, the earthquake, or the &s;torm.
<PB N="334" REF="341">
In the mid&s;t of their inju&s;tice and violence
he can pity their blindne&s;s; and imitate our
ble&s;&s;ed Lord in praying, <HI>Father, forgive
them; for they know not what they do.</HI></P>

And Eli&s;ha an&s;wered, The Lord hath
&s;hewed me that thou &s;halt be king over
Syria.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IN the days of Joram king of I&s;rael flou|ri&s;hed
the prophet Eli&s;ha.<NOTE PLACE="marg">SERM. XII.</NOTE> His character
was &s;o eminent, and his fame &s;o widely
&s;pread, that Benhadad the king of Syria,
<PB N="336" REF="343">
though an idolater, &s;ent to con&s;ult him con|cerning
the i&s;&s;ue of a di&s;temper which
threatened his life. The me&s;&s;enger em|ployed
on this occa&s;ion was Hazael, who
appears to have been one of the princes, or
chief men, of the Syrian court. Charged
with rich gifts from the king, he pre&s;ents
him&s;elf before the prophet; and acco&s;ts him
in terms of the highe&s;t re&s;pect. During the
conference which they held together, Eli&s;ha
fixed his eye &s;tedfa&s;tly on the countenance
of Hazael; and di&s;cerning, by a prophetic
&s;pirit, his future tyranny and cruelty, he
could not contain him&s;elf from bur&s;ting into
a flood of tears. When Hazael, in &s;urpri&s;e,
inquired ilnto the cau&s;e of this &s;udden emo|tion,
the prophet plainly informs him of the
crimes and barbarities which he for&s;aw
that herea&s;ter he &s;hould commit. The &s;oul
of Hazael abhorred, at this time, the thoughts
of cruelty. Uncorrupted, as yet, by am|bition
or greatne&s;s, his indignation aro&s;e at
being thought capable of &s;uch &s;avage actions
as the prophet had mentioned; and, with
much warmth, he replies, <HI>But what? is
<PB N="337" REF="344">
thy &s;ervant a dog, that he &s;hould do this great
thing?</HI> Eli&s;ha makes no return but to point
out a remarkable change which was to take
place in his conditon; <HI>The Lord hath
&s;hewed me that thou &s;halt be king over Syria.</HI>
In cour&s;e of time, all that had been pre|dicted
came to pa&s;s. Hazael a&s;ccended the
throne; and ambition took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his
heart. <HI>He &s;mote the children of I&s;rael in all
their coa&s;ts. He oppre&s;&s;ed them during all
the days of King Jeboabaz</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">2 Kings Xiii. 22.</NOTE>; and, from
what is left on record of his actions, plainly
appears to have proved what the prophet
fore&s;aw him to be, a man of violence,
cruelty, and blood.</P>
<P>In this pa&s;&s;age of hi&s;tory, an object is
pre&s;ented which de&s;erves our &s;erious atten|tion.
We behold a man who, in one &s;tate
of life, could not look upon certain crimes
without &s;urpri&s;e and horrour; who knew
&s;o little of himself as to believe it impo&s;&s;ible
for him ever to be concerned in commit|ting
them; that &s;ame man, by a change of
condition, transformed in all this &s;entiments,
<PB N="338" REF="345">
and as he ro&s;e in greatne&s;s, ri&s;ing al&s;o in
guilt; till at la&s;t he completed that whole
character of iniquity which he once de|te&s;ted.
Hence the following ob&s;ervations
naturally ari&s;e. I. That to a mind not
entirely corrupted, &s;entiments of abhorrence
at guilt are natural. II. That notwith|&s;tanding
tho&s;e &s;entiments, the mind may
be brought under the dominion of the vices
which it had mo&s;t abhorred. III. That
this unhappy revolution is frequently owing
to a change of men's external circum&s;tances
and condition in the world. The&s;e ob&s;er|vations
are to make the &s;ubject of the pre|&s;ent
di&s;cour&s;e; and will lead us to &s;uch a
view of human nature as, it is hoped, may
be of general u&s;e.</P>
<P>I. SENTIMENTS of abhorrence at guilt
are natural to the human mind. Hazael's
reply to the prophet &s;hews how &s;trongly he
felt them. <HI>Is thy &s;ervant a dog, that he
&s;hould do this great thing?</HI> Is he, or can he
ever be, &s;o ba&s;e and wretched as to perpe|trate
crimes, which would render him un|worthy
<PB N="339" REF="346">
of bearing the name of a man?
This is the voice of human nature, while
it is not as yet hardened in iniquity. Some
vices are indeed more odious to the mind
than others. Providence has wi&s;ely pointed
the &s;harpe&s;t edge of this natural aver&s;ion
agin&s;t the crimes which are of mo&s;t perni|cious
and de&s;trutive nature; &s;uch as trea|chery,
oppre&s;&s;ion, and cruelty. But, in ge|neral,
the di&s;tinction between moral good
and evil is &s;o &s;trongly marked, as to ac|company
almo&s;t every vice with &s;en&s;ible
di&s;apporbation. Pre&s;ent to any man, even
the mo&s;t ignorant and untutored, an ob|vious
in&s;tance of inju&s;tice, fal&s;ehood, or im|piety;
let him view it in a cool moment,
when no pa&s;&s;ion blinds, and no intere&s;t
warps him; and you will find that his mind
immediately revolts again&s;t it, as &s;hameful
and ba&s;e, nay as de&s;erving puni&s;hment.
Hence, in rea&s;oing on the characters of
others, however men may mi&s;take as to
facts, yet they generally prai&s;e and blame
according to the principles of &s;ound mo|rality.</P>
<P><PB N="340" REF="347">
With re&s;pect to their own character, a
notorious partiality too generally mi&s;leads
their judgment. But it is remarkable, that
no &s;inner ever avows directly to him&s;elf
that he has been guilty of gro&s;s and down|right
iniquity. Even when engaged by his
pa&s;&s;ions in the commi&s;&s;ion of the greate&s;t
crimes, he always palliates them to his own
mind by &s;ome extenuation or apology, &s;ome
pretended nece&s;&s;ity, or &s;ome borrowed co|lour
of innocence. Such power the unde|niable
dignity of virtue, and the acknow|ledged
turpitude of vice, po&s;&s;e&s;s over every
human heart. The&s;e &s;entiments are the re|maining
impre&s;&s;ions of that law, which was
originally written on the mind of man.
They are gleams of that light which once
&s;hone clear and &s;trong within us; and which,
though it be now greatly ob&s;ecured, yet con|tinues
to &s;hoot a feeble ray athwart the
darkne&s;s of human nature.&mdash;But what|ever
&s;entiments of abhorrence at vice we
may at any time entertain, we have no
rea&s;on to build upon the&s;e a pre&s;umptuous
confidence of our continuance in virtue.
<PB N="341" REF="348">
For the next in&s;truction which the next
&s;ugge&s;ts is,</P>
<P>II. THAT &s;uch is man's ignorance of his
own character, &s;uch the frailty of his na|ture,
that he may one day become infa|mous
for tho&s;e very crimes which at pre&s;ent
he holds in dete&s;tation. This ob&s;ervation
is too well verified by the hi&s;tory of Hazael;
and a thou&s;and other in&s;tances might be
brought to confirm it. Though there is
nothing which every per&s;on ought to know
&s;o thoroughly as his own heart, yet from
the conduct of men it appears, that there is
nothing with which they are le&s;s acquainted.
Always more prone to flatter them&s;elves
than de&s;irous to di&s;cover the truth, they
tru&s;t to their being po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of every virtue
which has not been put to the trial; and
reckon them&s;elves &s;ecure again&s;t every vice
to which they have not hitherto been
tempted. As long as their duty hangs in
&s;peculation, it appears &s;o plain, and &s;o eli|gible,
that they cannot doubt of performing
it. The &s;u&s;picion never enters their mind,
<PB N="342" REF="349">
that in the hour of &s;peculation, and in the
hour of practice, their &s;entiments may differ
widely. Their pre&s;ent di&s;po&s;ition they ea|&s;ily
per&s;uade them&s;elves will ever continue
the &s;ame; and yet that di&s;po&s;ition is chan|ging
with circum&s;tances every moment.</P>
<P>The man who glows with the warm feel|ings
of devotion, imagines it impo&s;&s;ible for
him to lo&s;e that &s;en&s;e of the divine good|ne&s;s
which at pre&s;ent melts his heart. He
whom his friend has friend has lately &s;aved from ruin
is confident that, if &s;ome trying emergency
&s;hall put his gratitude to proof, he will ra|ther
die than abandon his benefactor. He
who lives happy and contented in frugal
indu&s;try, wonders how any man can give
him&s;elf up to di&s;&s;olute plea&s;ure. Were any
of tho&s;e per&s;ons informed by a &s;uperiour
&s;pirit, that the time was &s;hortly to come
when the one &s;hould prove an example of
&s;candalous impiety, the other of treachery
to his friend, and the third of all that ex|travagant
luxury which di&s;graces a growing
fortune; each of them would te&s;tify as much
&s;urpri&s;e and abhorrence as Hazael did, upon
<PB N="343" REF="350">
hearing the predictions of the prophet. Sin|cere
they might very po&s;&s;ibly be in their
expre&s;&s;ions of indignation; for hypocri&s;y
is not always to be charged on men who&s;e
conduct is incon&s;i&s;tent. Hazael was in
earne&s;t, when he re&s;ented with &s;uch ardour
the imputation of cruelty. The Apo&s;tle
Peter was &s;incere, when he made the zealous
profe&s;&s;ion, that though he &s;hould go to
pri&s;on and to death with his ma&s;ter, he
would never deny him. They were &s;in|cere;
that is, they &s;poke from the fulne&s;s
of their hearts, and from the warmth of the
pre&s;ent moment; but they did not know
them&s;elves, as the events which followed
plainly &s;howed. So fal&s;e to its principles,
too frequently, is the heart of man; &s;o
weak is the foundation of human virtue; &s;o
much rea&s;on there is for what the go&s;pel
perpetually inculcates concerning the nece&s;|&s;ity
of di&s;tru&s;ting our&s;elves, and depending
on divine aid. Mortifying, I confe&s;s, is
this view of human nature; yet proper to
be attended to by all, in order to e&s;cape the
mo&s;t fatal dangers. Fro, merely through
<PB N="344" REF="351">
unguarded conduct, and from the want of
this prudent &s;u&s;picion of their own weak|ne&s;s,
how many, after the mo&s;t promi&s;ing
beginnings, have gradually apo&s;tatized from
every principle of virtue; until, at la&s;t, it
has become as difficult for one to believe
that they ever had any love of goodne&s;s, as
it would have been once to have per&s;uaded
them&s;elves that they were to advance to
&s;uch a height in wickedne&s;s?</P>
<P>IN &s;uch ca&s;es as I have de&s;cribed, what
has become, it may be enquired, of tho&s;e
&s;entiments of abhorrence at guilt which
were once felt &s;o &s;trongly? Are they to|tally
era&s;ed? or, if in any degree they re|main,
how do &s;uch per&s;ons contrive to
&s;atisfy them&s;elves in acting a part which
their minds condemn?&mdash;Here, there is a
my&s;tery of iniquity which requires to be
unfolded. Latent and &s;ecret is the progre&s;s
of corruption within the &s;oul; and the
more latent, the more dangerous is its
growth. No man becomes of a &s;udden
completely wicked. Guilt never &s;hows its
<PB N="345" REF="352">
whole deformity at once; but by gradual
acquaintance reconciles us to its appearance,
and imperceptibly diffu&s;es its poi&s;on through
all the powers of the mind. Every man
has &s;ome darling pa&s;&s;ion which generally
affords the fir&s;t introduction to vice. The
irregular gratifications into which it occa|&s;ionally
&s;educes him, appear under the form
of venial weakne&s;&s;es; and are indulged, in
the beginning, with &s;crupulou&s;ne&s;s and re|&s;erve.
But by longer practice the&s;e re|&s;traints
weaken, and the power of habit
grows. One vice brings in another to its
aid. By a &s;ort of natural affinity they con|nect
and entwine them&s;elves together; till
their roots come to be &s;pread wide and deep
over all the &s;oul. When guilt ri&s;es to be
glaring, con&s;cience endeavours to remon|&s;trate.
But con&s;cience is a calm principle.
Pa&s;&s;ion is loud and impetuous; and creates
a tumult which drowns the voice of rea&s;on.
It joins, be&s;ides, arti&s;ice to violence; and
&s;educes at the &s;ame time that it impels.
For it employs the under&s;tanding to impo&s;e
upon the con&s;cience. It devi&s;es rea&s;ons
<PB N="346" REF="353">
and arguments to ju&s;tify the corruptions of
the heart. The common practice of the
world is appealed to. Nice di&s;tinctions are
made. Men are found to be circum&s;tanced
in &s;o peculiar a manner, as to render cer|tain
actions excu&s;able, if not blamele&s;s,
which, in another &s;ituation, it is confe&s;&s;ed
would have been criminal. By &s;uch a pro|ce&s;s
as this, there is rea&s;on to believe that
a great part of mankind advance from &s;tep
to &s;tep in &s;in, partly hurried by pa&s;&s;ion,
and partly blinded by &s;elf-deceit, without
any ju&s;t &s;en&s;e of the degree of guilt which
they contract. By inveterate habits the$$
judgment is, at length, perverted, and their
moral feelings are deadened. They &s;ee
now with other eyes; and can look with|out
pian on evil actions which they for|merly
abhorred.</P>
<P>It is proper, however, to ob&s;erve, that
though our native &s;entiments of abhorrence
at guilt may be &s;o born down, or &s;o $luded
as to lo&s;e their influence on conduct, yet
tho&s;e sentiments belonging originally to our
frame, and being never totally $radicated
<PB N="347" REF="354">
from the &s;oul, will &s;till retain &s;o much au|thority,
as if not to reform, at lea&s;t on &s;ome
occa&s;ions, to cha&s;ten the &s;inner. It is only
during a cour&s;e of pro&s;perity, that vice is
able to carry on its delu&s;ions without di&s;|turbance.
But, amid&s;t the dark and
thoughtful &s;ituations of life, con&s;cience re|gains
its rights; and pours the whole bit|terne&s;s
of remor&s;e on his heart who has
apo&s;tatized from his original principles.
We may well believe that, before the end
of his days, Hazael's fir&s;t impre&s;&s;ions would
be made to return. In the hour of adver|&s;ity,
the remembrance of his con&s;erence
with the venerable Prophet would &s;ting his
heart. Comparing the &s;entiments which,
in tho&s;e his better days, he felt, with the
atrocious cruelties which he had afterwards
committed, all the honours of royalty would
be unable to &s;ave him from the inward &s;en&s;e
of ba&s;ene&s;s and in&s;amy.</P>
<P>FROM this view which has been exhi|bited
of the progre&s;s of corruption, and of
the danger of which we are expo&s;ed of
<PB N="348" REF="355">
falling from principles with once appeared
firmly e&s;tabli&s;hed, let us receive u&s;eful ad|monition
for our own conduct. <HI>Let not
him that girdeth on his harne&s;s, boa&s;t like him
that putteth it off.</HI> Let no man place a ra&s;h
and dangerous confidence in his virtue.
But <HI>let him that thinketh he &s;tandeth, take
heed le&s;t he fall.</HI> Never adventure on too
near an approach to what is evil. Fami|liarize
not your&s;elves with it, in the &s;light|e&s;t
in&s;tances, without fear. Li&s;ten with
reverence to every reprehen&s;ion of con|&s;cience;
and pre&s;erve the mo&s;t quick and
accurate &s;en&s;ibility to right and wrong. If
ever your moral impre&s;&s;ions begin to de|cay,
and your natural abhorrence of guilt
to le&s;&s;en, you have ground to dread that
the ruin of virtue is fa&s;t approaching.
While you employ all the circum&s;pection
and vigilance which rea&s;on can &s;ugge&s;t, let
your prayers, at the &s;ame time, continually
a&s;cend to God for &s;upport and aid. Re|member
that from his <HI>de&s;cendeth every good
and perfect gift;</HI> and that to him only it
belongs to <HI>keep you from falling, and to pre|&s;ent

you faultle&s;s before the pre&s;ence of his
glory with exceeding joy.</HI> I proceed now to

<P>III. OBSERVATION from the text, That
the power which corruption acquires to
pervert the original principles of men, is
frequently owing to a change of their cir|cum&s;tances
and condition in the world.
How different was Hazael the me&s;&s;enger
of Benhadad, from Hazael the king; he
who &s;tarted at the mention of cruelty, from
him who waded in blood! Of this &s;ad
and &s;urpri&s;ing revolution, the Prophet em|phatically
a&s;&s;igns the cau&s;e in the&s;e few
words; <HI>The Lord hath &s;hewed me that thou
&s;halt be king over Syria.</HI> That crown, that
fatal crown, which is to be &s;et upon thy
head, &s;hall &s;hed a malignant influence over
thy nature; and &s;hall produce that change
in thy character which now thou can&s;t
not believe.&mdash;Who&s;e experience of the
world is &s;o narrow, as not to furni&s;h him
with in&s;tances &s;imilar to this, in much
humbler conditions of life? So great is
<PB N="350" REF="357">
the influence of a new &s;ituation of external
fortune; &s;uch a different turn it gives to
our temper and affections, to our views
and de&s;ires, that no man can foretell what
his character would prove, &s;hould Providence
either rai&s;e or depre&s;s his circum&s;tances in
a remarkable degree, or throw him into
&s;ome &s;phere of action widely different from
that to which he has been accu&s;tomed in
former life.</P>
<P>The &s;eeds of various qualities, good and
bad, lie in all our hearts. But until pro|per
occa&s;ions r$pen, and bring them for|ward,
they lie there inactive and dead.
They are covered up and concealed within
the rece&s;&s;es of our nature: or, if they &s;pring
up at all, it is under &s;uch an appearance as
is frequently mi&s;taken, even by our&s;elves.
Pride, for in&s;tance, in certain &s;ituations,
has no opportunity of di&s;playing it&s;elf, but
as magnanimity, or &s;en&s;e of honour. Ava|rice
appears as nece&s;&s;ary and laudable oeco|nomy.
What in one &s;tation of life would
di&s;cover it&s;elf to be cowardice and ba&s;ene&s;s
of mind, pa&s;&s;es in another for prudent cir|cum&s;pection.
<PB N="351" REF="358">
What in the fulne&s;s of power
would prove to be cruelty and oppre&s;&s;ion,
is reputed, in a &s;ubordinate rank, no more
than the exerci&s;e of proper di&s;cipline. For
a while, the man is known neither by the
world, nor by him&s;elf, to be what he truly
is. But bring him into a new &s;ituation of
life, which accords with his predominant
di&s;po&s;ition; which &s;trikes on certain latent
qualities of his &s;oul, and awakens them into
action; and, as the leaves of a flower gra|dually
unfold to the &s;un, &s;o &s;hall all his
true character open full to view.</P>
<P>This may, in one light, be accounted
not &s;o much an alteration of character pro|duced
by a change of circum&s;tances, as a
di&s;covery brought forth of the real character,
which formerly lay concealed. Yet, at the
&s;ame time, it is true that the man him&s;elf
undergoes a change. For opportunity being
given for certain di&s;po&s;itions, which had
been dormant, to exert them&s;elves without
re&s;traint, they of cour&s;e gather &s;trength.
By means of the a&s;cendency which they
gain, other parts of the temper are borne
<PB N="352" REF="359">
down; and thus an alteration is made in
the whole &s;tructure and &s;y&s;tem of the &s;oul.
He is a truly wi&s;e and good man who,
through divine a&s;&s;i&s;tance, remains &s;uperi|our
to this influence of fortune on his cha|racter;
who having once imbibed worthy
&s;entiments, and e&s;tabli&s;hed proper principles
of action, continues con&s;tant to the&s;e,
whatever his circum&s;tances be; maintains,
throughout all the changes of his life, one
uniform and &s;upported tenour of conduct;
and what he abhorred as evil and wicked in
the beginning of his days, continues to ab|hor
to the end. But how rare is it to meet
with this honourable con&s;i&s;tency among
men, while they are pa&s;&s;ing through the
different &s;tations and periods of life! When
they are &s;etting out in the world, before
their minds have been greatly mi&s;led or
deba&s;ed, they glow with generous emotions,
and look with contempt on what is $orbid
and guilty. But advancing farther in life,
and inured by degrees to the crooked ways
of men; pre&s;&s;ing through the crowd, and
the bu&s;tle of the world; obliged to contend
<PB N="353" REF="360">
with this man's craft, and that man's &s;corn;
accu&s;tomed, &s;ometimes, to conceal their
&s;entiments, and often to &s;tifle their feelings,
they became at la&s;t hardened in heart, and
familiar with corruption. Who would not
drop a tear over this &s;ad, but frequent fall of
human probity and honour! Who is not
humbled, when he beholds the refined &s;en|timents
and high principles on which we
are &s;o ready to value our&s;elves, brought to
&s;uch a &s;hameful i&s;&s;ue; and man, with all
his boa&s;ted attainments of rea&s;on, di&s;cover|ed
&s;o often to be the creature of his exter|nal
fortune, moulded and formed by the
incidents of his life!</P>
<P>THE in&s;tance of Hazael's degeneracy
leads us to reflect, in particular, on the dan|gers
which ari&s;e from &s;tations of power and
greatne&s;s; e&s;pecially, when the elevation of
men to the&s;e has been rapid and &s;udden.
Few have the &s;trength of mind which is re|qui&s;ite
for bearing &s;uch a change with tem|perance,
and &s;elf-command. The re&s;pect
which is paid to the great, and the &s;cope
<PB N="354" REF="361">
which their condition affords for the indul|gence
of plea&s;ure, are perilous circum&s;tances
to virtue. When men live among their
equals, and are accu&s;tomed to encounter the
hard&s;hips of life, they are of cour&s;e remind|ed
of their mutual dependence on each
other, and of the dependence of all upon
God. But when they are highly exalted
above their fellows, they meet with few
objects to awaken &s;erious reflection, but
with many to feed and inflame their pa&s;|&s;ions.
They are apt to &s;eparate their in|tere&s;t
from that of all around them; to
wrap them&s;elves up in their vain grandeur;
and in the lap of indolence and &s;elfi&s;h plea|&s;ure,
to acquire a cold indifference to the
concerns even of tho&s;e whom they call their
friends. The fancied independence into which
they are $word$ up, in adver&s;e to &s;entiments
of piety, as well as of humanity, in their
heart. <HI>Taking the timbrel and the harp, and
rejoicing at the &s;ound of the organ, they &s;ay
unto God, Depart from us, for we de&s;ire not
the knowledge of thy ways. What is the
Almighty that we &s;hould &s;erve him? or what
<PB N="355" REF="362">
profit &s;hould we have, if we pray unto
him?</HI></P>
<P>But we are not to imagine, that elevated
&s;tations in the world furni&s;h the only formi|dable
trials to which our virtue is expo&s;ed.
It will be found, that we are liable to no
fewer nor le&s;s dangerous temptations, from
the oppo&s;ite extreme of poverty and depre&s;|&s;ion.
When men who have known better
days are thrown down into abject &s;ituations
of fortune, their &s;pirits are broken and their
tempers &s;oured. Envy rankles in their
brea&s;t at &s;uch as are more &s;ucce&s;sful. The
providence of Heaven is accu&s;ed in &s;ecret
murmurs; and the &s;en&s;e of mi&s;ery is ready
to pu&s;h them into atrocious crimes, in order
to better their &s;tate. Among the inferiour
cla&s;&s;es of mankind, craft and di&s;hone&s;ty are
too often found to prevail. Low and pe|nurious
circum&s;tances depre&s;s the human
powers. They deprive men of the proper
means of knowledge and improvement; and
where ignorance is gro&s;s, it is always in
hazard of engendering profligacy.</P>
<P><PB N="356" REF="363">
Hence it has been, generally, the opi|nion
of wi&s;e men in all ages, that there is
a certain middle condition of life, equally
remote from either of tho&s;e extremes of
fortune, which, though it want not al&s;o its
own dangers, yet is, on the whole, the
&s;tate mo&s;t favourable both to virtue and to
happine&s;s. For there, luxury and pride on
the one hand, have not opportunity to ener|vate
or intoxicate the mind, nor want and
dependence on the other, to &s;ink and de|base
it; there, all the native affections of
the &s;oul have the free&s;t and faire&s;t exerci&s;e,
the equality of men is felt, friend&s;hips are
formed, and improvements of every &s;ort are
pur&s;ued with mo&s;t &s;ucce&s;s; there, men are
prompted to indu&s;try without being over|come
by toil, and their powers called forth
into exertion, without being either &s;uper|&s;eded
by too much abundance, or baffled
by in&s;uperable difficulties; there, a mixture
of comforts and of wants, at once awakens
their gratitude to God, and reminds them
of their dependence on his aid; and there|fore,
in this &s;tate, men &s;eem to enjoy life to
<PB N="357" REF="364">
mo&s;t advantage, and to be lea&s;t expo&s;ed to
the &s;nares of vice. Such a condition is re|corded,
in the book of Proverbs, to have
been the wi&s;h and choice of one who was
eminent for wi&s;dom. <HI>Remove far from me
vanity and lies. Give me neither poverty nor
riches. Feed me with food convenient for
me. Le&s;t I be full and deny thee, and &s;ay,
Who is the Lord? or le&s;t I be poor and &s;teal,
and take the name of my God in vain</HI><NOTE PLACE="foot">Prov. xxx. 8, 9.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>FROM the whole view which we have
now taken of the &s;ubject, we may, in the
fir&s;t place, learn the rea&s;ons for which a
variety of conditions and ranks was e&s;ta|bli&s;hed
by Providence among mankind.
This life is obviou&s;ly intended to be a &s;tate
of probation and trial. No trial of charac|ters
is requi&s;ite with re&s;pect to God, who
&s;ees what is in every heart, and perfectly
knows what part each man would act, in all
the po&s;&s;ible &s;ituations of fortune. But on
account of men them&s;elves, and of the
<PB N="358" REF="365">
world around them, it was nece&s;&s;ary that
trial &s;hould take place, and a di&s;crimination
of characters be made; in order that true
virtue might be &s;eparated from fal&s;e appear|ances
of it, and the ju&s;tice of Heaven be
di&s;played in its final retributions; in order
that the failings of men might be &s;o di&s;|covered
to them&s;elves, as to afford them
proper in&s;truction, and promote their amend|ment;
and in order that their characters
might be &s;hown to the world in every
point of view, which could furni&s;h either
examples for imitation, or admonitions of
danger. The accompli&s;hment of the&s;e im|portant
purpo&s;es required, that human life
&s;hould not always proceed in one tenour;
but that it &s;hould both be chequered with
many revolutions, and diver&s;ified by a va|riety
of employments and ranks; in pa&s;&s;|ing
through which, the touch&s;tone might
be applied to the characters of men, and
their hidden virtues or vices explored.
Hazael might have appeared in hi&s;tory with
a degree of reputation to which he was not
entitled, had he continued to act in a &s;ub|ordinate
<PB N="359" REF="366">
&s;tation. At bottom, he was fal&s;e
and un&s;ound. When rai&s;ed higher in life,
the corruption of his heart di&s;covered it&s;elf;
and he is now held forth with de&s;erved in|famy,
as a warning to &s;ucceeding ages.</P>
<P>IN the &s;econd place we learn, from what
has been &s;aid, the importance of attending
with the utmo&s;t care to the choice which we
make of our employment and condition in
life. It has been &s;hown, that our external
&s;ituation frequently operates powerfully on
our moral character; and by con&s;equence
that it is &s;trictly connected, not only with
our temporal welfare, but with our ever|la&s;ting
happine&s;s or mi&s;ery. He who might
have pa&s;&s;ed unblamed, and upright, through
certain walks of life, by unhappily chu&s;ing
a road where he meets with temptations too
&s;trong for his virtue, precipitates him&s;elf
into &s;hame here, and into endle&s;s ruin here|after.
Yet how often is the determination
of this mo&s;t important article left to the
chance of accidental connections, or &s;ub|mitted
to the option of youthful fancy and
<PB N="360" REF="367">
humour? When it is made the &s;ubject of
&s;erious deliberation, how &s;eldom have they,
on whom the deci&s;ion of it depends, any
further view than &s;o to di&s;po&s;e of one who
is coming out into life, as that he may the
&s;oone&s;t become rich, or, as it is expre&s;&s;ed,
make his way to mo&s;t advantage in the
world? Are there no other objects than
this to be attended to, in $ixing the plan of
life? Are there no more &s;acred and im|portant
intere&s;ts which de&s;erve to be con|&s;ulted?
&mdash;You would not willingly place
one for who&s;e welfare you was interested, in
a situation for which you were convinced
that his abilities were unequal. The&s;e,
therefore, you examine with care; and on
them you re&s;t the ground of your deci&s;ion.
Be per&s;uaded that not abilities merely, but
the turn of the temper and the heart, require
to be examined with equal attention, in
forming the plan of furture e&s;tabli&s;hment.
Every one has &s;ome peculiar weakne&s;s,
&s;ome predominant pa&s;&s;ion, which expo&s;es
him to temptations of one kind more than
of another. Early this may be di&s;cerned
<PB N="361" REF="368">
to &s;hoot; and from its fir&s;t ri&s;ings its fu|ture
growth may be inferred. Anticipate
its progre&s;s. Con&s;ider how it is likely to
be affected, by &s;ucceeding occurrences in
life. If you bring one whom you are rear|ing
up into a &s;ituation, where all the &s;ur|rounding
circum&s;tances &s;hall cheri&s;h and
mature this fatal principle in his nature,
you become, in a great mea&s;ure, an&s;werable
for the con&s;equences that follow. In vain
you tru&s;t to his abilities and powers. Vice
and corruption, when they have tainted the
heart, are &s;ufficient to over&s;et the greate&s;t
abilities. Nay, too frequently they tur$
them again&s;t the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or; and render
them the in&s;truments of his more &s;peedy
ruin.</P>
<P>IN the third place, we learn from the
hi&s;tory which has been illu&s;trated, never to
judge of true happine&s;s, merely from the
degree of men's advancement in the world.
Always betrayed by appearances, the mul|titude
are caught by nothing &s;o much as by
the &s;how and pomp of life. They think
<PB N="362" REF="369">
every one ble&s;t, who is rai&s;ed far above others
in rank. From their earlie&s;t years they are
taught to fix their views upon worldly ele|vation,
as the ultimate object of their aims;
and of all the &s;ources of error in conduct,
this is the mo&s;t general.&mdash;Hazael on the
throne of Syria would, doubtle&s;s, be more
envied, and e&s;teemed by the multitude a
far happier man than, when yet a &s;ubject,
he was employed by Benhadad to carry his
me&s;&s;age to Eli&s;ha. Yet, O Hazael! how
much better had it been for thee never to
have known the name or honour of a king,
than to have purcha&s;ed it at the expence of
&s;o much guilt; forfeiting thy fir&s;t and be&s;t
character; ru&s;hing into crimes which were
once thine abhorrence; and becoming a
traitor to the native &s;entiments and dictates
of thy heart! How fatal to thy repo&s;e
proved that coveted purple, which was
drenched by thee in &s;o much innocent blood!
How much more cheerful were thy days,
and how much calmer thy nights, in the
former periods of thy life, than, when
placed on a throne, thy car$ were invaded
<PB N="363" REF="370">
by day with the cries of the mi&s;erable whom
thou had&s;t ruined; and thy &s;lumbers broken
by night with the &s;hocking remembrance of
thy cruelties and crimes!&mdash;Never let us
judge by the out&s;ide of things; nor con|clude
a man to be happy, &s;olely becau&s;e he
is encompa&s;&s;ed with wealth or grandeur.
Much mi&s;ery often lurks where it is little
&s;u&s;pected by the world. The material en|quiries
re&s;pecting felicity are, not what a
man's external condition is, but with what
di&s;po&s;ition of mind he bears it; whether he
be corrupted or improved by it; whether
he conducts him&s;elf &s;o as to be acceptable
to God, and approved of by good men.
For the&s;e are the circum&s;tances which make
the real and important di&s;tinctions among
the conditions of men. The effects of the&s;e
are to la&s;t for ever, when all worldly di&s;|tinctions
&s;hall be forgotten.</P>
<P>IN the fourth place, from all that has
been &s;aid, we &s;hould learn never to be im|moderately
anxious about our external &s;itu|ation,
but to &s;ubmit our lot with cheerful|ne&s;s
to the di&s;po&s;al of Heaven. To make
<PB N="364" REF="371">
the be&s;t and mo&s;t prudent arrangements
which we can, re&s;pecting our condition in
life, is matter of high duty. But let us
rememeber, that all the plans which we form
are precarious and uncertain. After the
utmo&s;t precautions taken by human wi&s;|dom,
no man can fore&s;ee the hidden dan|gers
which may await him in that path of
life on which he has pitched. Providence
chu&s;es for us much more wi&s;ely than we
can chu&s;e for our&s;elves; and, from circum|&s;tances
that appeared at fir&s;t mo&s;t unpro|mi&s;ing
and adver&s;e, often brings forth in
the i&s;&s;ue both temporal and &s;piritual felicity.
<HI>Who knoweth what is good for man in this
life, all the days of his vain life, which he
&s;pendeth as a &s;hadow?</HI> When we con&s;ider
the darkne&s;s of our pre&s;ent &s;tate, the im|becility
of human nature, and the doubtful
and ambiguous value of all that we call
pro&s;perity, the exhortation of the P&s;almi&s;t
comes home with great force on every re|flecting
mind, <HI>Commit thy way unto the
Lord</HI><NOTE PLACE="foot">P&s;alm xxxvii. 5.</NOTE>. Form thy mea&s;ures with prudence&punc;
<PB N="365" REF="372">
but dive&s;t thy&s;elf of anxiety about the i&s;&s;ue.
In&s;tead of &s;eeking to order thine own lot,
acquie&s;ce in the appointment of Heaven,
and follow without he&s;itation the call of
Providence, and of duty. In whatever &s;itu|ation
of life God &s;hall place thee, look up
devoutly to Him for grace and a&s;&s;i&s;tance;
and &s;tudy to act the part a&s;&s;igned thee with
a faithful and upright heart. Thus &s;halt

<Q>It is better to go to the hou&s;e of mourning,
than to go to the hou&s;e of fea&s;ting; for that
is the end of all men, and the living will
lay it to his heart. Sorrow is better than
laughter; for by the &s;adne&s;s of the coun|tenance
the heart is made better. The
heart of the wi&s;e is in the hou&s;e of mourn|ing;
but the heart of fools is in the hou&s;e
of mirth.</Q>

<P>MANY of the maxims contained in
this book of Eccle&s;ia&s;tes will appear
&s;trange &s;ayings to the men of the world.<NOTE PLACE="marg">SERM. XIII.</NOTE>
But when they reflect on the character of
<PB N="367" REF="374">
him who delivers them, they cannot but
admit that his tenets de&s;erve a &s;erious and
attentive examination. For they are not
the doctrines of a pedant, who, from an
ob&s;cure retirement, declaims again&s;t plea|&s;ures
which he never knew. They are not
the invectives of a di&s;appointed man, who
takes revenge upon the world, by &s;atirizing
tho&s;e enjoyments, which he &s;ought in vain to
obtain. They are the conclu&s;ions of a great
and pro&s;perous prince, who had once given
full &s;cope to his de&s;ires; who was thoroughly
acquainted with life in its mo&s;t flattering
&s;cenes; and who now, reviewing all that
he had enjoyed, delivers to us the re&s;ult of
long experience, and tried wi&s;dom. None
of his principles &s;eem, at fir&s;t view, more
dubious and exceptionable than tho&s;e which
the text pre&s;ents. To a&s;&s;ert that &s;orrow is
preferable to mirth, and the <HI>hou&s;e of mourn|ing</HI>
to the <HI>hou&s;e of fea&s;ting;</HI> to advi&s;e men
to chu&s;e mortification and &s;adne&s;s when it
is in their power to indulge in joy, may
appear har&s;h and unrea&s;onable doctrines.
They may, perhaps, be accounted enemies
<PB N="368" REF="375">
to the innocent enjoyment of life who give
countenance to &s;o &s;evere a &s;y&s;tem, and
thereby increa&s;e the gloom which already
&s;its &s;ufficiently heavy on the condition of
man. But let this cen&s;ure be &s;u&s;pended,
until we examine with care into the &s;pirit
and meaning of the &s;entiments here de|livered.</P>
<P>It is evident that the wi&s;e man does not
prefer &s;orrow, upon its own account, to
mirth; or repre&s;ent &s;adne&s;s as a &s;tate more
eligible than joy. He con&s;iders it in the
light of di&s;cipline only. He views it with
reference to an end. He compares it with
certain improvements which he &s;uppo&s;es it
to produce; when <HI>the heart is made better
by the &s;adne&s;s of the countenance, and the
living to lay to heart what is the end of all
men.</HI> Now, if great and la&s;ting benefits
are found to re&s;ult from occa&s;ional &s;adne&s;s,
the&s;e, &s;ure, may be capable of giving it the
preference to &s;ome fleeting &s;en&s;ations of joy.
The means which he recommends in order
to our obtaining tho&s;e benefits are to be ex|plained
according to the principles of &s;ound
<PB N="369" REF="376">
rea&s;on; and to be under&s;tood with tho&s;e
limitations which the ea&s;tern &s;tyle, in de|livering
moral precepts, frequently requires.
He bids us <HI>go to the hou&s;e of mourning;</HI> but
he does not command us to dwell there.
When he prefers &s;orrow to laughter, he is
not to be under&s;tood as prohibiting all mirth;
as requiring us to wear a perpetual cloud on
our brow, and to &s;eque&s;trate our&s;elves from
every cheerful entertainment of &s;ocial life.
Such an interpretation would be incon&s;i&s;tent
with many other exhortations in his own
writings, which recommend temperate and
innocent joy. It would not &s;uit with the
proper di&s;charge of the duties which be|long
to us as members of &s;ociety; and
would be mo&s;t oppo&s;ite to the goodne&s;s and
benignity of our Creator. The true &s;cope
of his doctrine in this pa&s;&s;age is, that there
is a certain temper and &s;tate of heart, which
is of far greater con&s;equence of real happi|ne&s;s,
than the habitual indulgence of giddy
and thoughtle&s;s mirth; that for the attain|ment
and cultivation of this temper, fre|quent
returns of grave reflection are nece&s;|&s;ary;
<PB N="370" REF="377">
that, upon this account, it is profit|able
to give admi&s;&s;ion to tho&s;e views of hu|man
di&s;tre&s;s which tend to awaken &s;uch
reflection in the mind; and that thus, from
the vici&s;&s;itudes of &s;orrow, which we either
experience in our own lot, or &s;ympathize
with in the lot of others, much wi&s;dom and
improvement may be derived. The&s;e are
the &s;entiments which I purpo&s;e at pre&s;ent
to ju&s;tify and recommend, as mo&s;t &s;uitable
to the character of men and of Chri&s;tians;
and not in the lea&s;t incon&s;i&s;tent with plea|&s;ure,
rightly under&s;tood.</P>
<P>Among the variety of di&s;po&s;itions which
are to be found in the world, &s;ome indeed
require le&s;s of this di&s;cipline than others.
There are per&s;ons who&s;e tender and deli|cate
&s;en&s;ibility, either derived from nature,
or brought on by repeated afflictions, ren|ders
them too deeply &s;u&s;ceptible of every
mournful impre&s;&s;ion; who&s;e &s;pirits &s;tand
more in need of being &s;upported and cheer|ed,
than of being &s;addened by the dark
views of human life. In &s;uch ca&s;es, we are
commanded to <HI>lift up the hands which hang
<PB N="371" REF="378">
down, and to confirm the feeble knees</HI><NOTE PLACE="foot">I&s;aiah xxxv. 3. Heb. xii. 12.</NOTE>. But
this is far from being the common di&s;po&s;i|tion
of men. Their minds are in general
inclined to levity, much more than to
thoughtful m$lancholy; and their hearts
more apt to be contracted and hardened,
than to relent with too much facility. I
&s;hall therefore endeavour to &s;hew them, what
bad inclinations their compliance with So|lomon's
advice would correct; what good
di&s;po&s;itions with re&s;pect to God, their neigh|bours,
and them&s;elves, it would improve;
and how, upon the whole, his doctrine is
verified, that <HI>by the &s;adne&s;s of the countenance
the heart is made better.</HI></P>
<P>I B$GIN by ob&s;erving, that the temper
recommended in the text &s;uits the pre&s;ent
con&s;titution of things in this world. Had
man been de&s;tined for a cour&s;e of undi&s;|turbed
enjoyment, perpetual gaiety would
then have corre&s;ponded to his &s;tate; and
pen&s;ive thought have been an unnatural
intru&s;ion. But in a &s;tate where all is che|quered
<PB N="372" REF="379">
and mixed, where there is no pro|&s;perity
without a rever&s;e, and no joy with|out
its attending griefs; where from the
hou&s;e of fea&s;ting all mu&s;t, at one time or
other, pa&s;s into the hou&s;e of mourning, it
were equally unnatural if no admi&s;&s;ion was
given to grave reflection. The mind of
man mu&s;t be attempered to his condition.
Providence, who&s;e wi&s;dom is con&s;picuous
in all its works, ha adju&s;ted with exact
proportion the inward powers to the out|ward
&s;tate of every rational being. It has
for this purpo&s;e implanted the &s;erious and
&s;ympathetic feelings in our nature, that they
might corre&s;pond with the vici&s;&s;itudes of
&s;orrow in our lot. He who endeavours to
repel their influence, or to &s;tifle them in
un&s;ea&s;onable mirth, acts a violent and un|natural
part. He &s;trives with vain effort
again&s;t the current of things; contradicts
the intentions of his Maker, and counter|acts
the original impul&s;es of his own heart.</P>
<P>It is proper al&s;o to ob&s;erve, that as <HI>the
&s;adne&s;s of the countenance</HI> has, in our pre&s;ent
&s;ituation, a proper and natural place; &s;o it
<PB N="373" REF="380">
is requi&s;ite to the true enjoyment of plea|&s;ure.
Worldly and &s;en&s;ual men often re|mark
not, till it be too late, that, by the
&s;tudied efforts of con&s;tant repetition, all their
plea&s;ures fail. They draw them off &s;o clo&s;e
to the dregs, that they become in&s;ipid and
nau&s;eous. Hence even <HI>in laughter their
heart is &s;orrowful, and the end of their mirth
is heavine&s;s</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Prov. xiv. 13.</NOTE>. It is only the interpo&s;al of
&s;erious an thoughtful hours, that can give
any lively &s;en&s;ation to the returns of joy.
I &s;peak not of tho&s;e thoughtful hours, too
well known to &s;inners, which proceed from
guilty remor&s;e; and which, in&s;tead of pre|paring
for future plea&s;ure, damp and &s;icken
the moment of enjoyment; but of tho&s;e
which take ri&s;e from the mind retreating
into it&s;elf, and opening to the &s;entiments of
religion and humanity. Such hours of
virtuous &s;adne&s;s brighten the gleams of &s;uc|ceding
joy. They give to the temperate
enjoyments of the pious and humane a re|fined
and delicate reli&s;h, to which the hard|ened
and in&s;en&s;ible are entire &s;trangers.</P>
<P><PB N="374" REF="381">
For it will be found, that in proportion as
the tender affections of the &s;oul are kept
awake, how much &s;oever they may &s;ome|times
di&s;tre&s;s the heart, they pre&s;erve it open
likewi&s;e to the mo&s;t agreeable &s;en&s;ations.
He who never knew the &s;orrows of friend|&s;hip,
never al&s;o knew its joys. He who&s;e
heart cannot relent in the hou&s;e of mourn|ing,
will, in the mo&s;t &s;ocial hour of the
hou&s;e of fea&s;ting, partake of no more than
the lowe&s;t part of animal plea&s;ure.&mdash;
Having premi&s;ed the&s;e ob&s;ervations, I pro|ceed
to point out the direct effects of a
proper attention to the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of life upon
our moral and religious character.</P>
<P>IN the fir&s;t place, the hou&s;e of mourn|ing
is calculated to give a proper check to
our natural thoughtle&s;&s;ne&s;s and levity. The
indolence of mankind, and their love of
plea&s;ure, &s;pread through all characters and
ranks &s;ome degree of aver&s;ion to what
is grave and &s;erious. They gra&s;p at any
object, either of bu&s;ine&s;s or amu&s;ement,
which makes the pre&s;ent moment pa&s;s
<PB N="375" REF="382">
&s;moothly away; which carries their thoughts
abroad, and &s;aves them from the trouble of
reflecting on them&s;elves. With too many,
this pa&s;&s;es into a habit of con&s;tant di&s;&s;ipa|tion.
If their fortune and rank allow them
to indulge their inclinations, they devote
them&s;elves to the pur&s;uit of amu&s;ement
through all its different forms. The &s;kilful
arrangement of its &s;ucce&s;&s;ive &s;cenes, and the
preparatory &s;tudy for &s;hining in each, are
the only exertions in which their under|&s;tanding
is employed. Such a mode of life
may keep alive, for a while, a frivolous vi|vacity.
It may improve men in &s;ome of
tho&s;e exteriour accompli&s;hments, which
&s;parkle in the eyes of the giddy and the
vain; but it mu&s;t &s;ink them in the e&s;teem
of all the wi$e. It renders them &s;trangers
to them&s;elves; and u&s;ele&s;s, if not perni|cious,
to the world. They lo&s;e every manly
principle. Their minds become relaxed
and effeminate. All that is great or re|&s;pectable
in the human character is buried
under a ma&s;s of trifles and follies.</P>
<P><PB N="376" REF="383">
If &s;ome mea&s;ures ought to be taken for
re&s;cuing the mind from this di&s;graceful le|vity;
if &s;ome principles mu&s;t be acquired
which may give more dignity and &s;teadi|ne&s;s
to conduct, where, I pray you, are
the&s;e to be looked for? Not &s;urely in the
hou&s;e of fea&s;ting, where every object flat|ters
the &s;en&s;es, and &s;trengthens the &s;educ|tions
to which we are already prone; where
the &s;pirit of di&s;&s;ipation circulates from heart
to heart; and the children of folly mutually
admire, and are admired. It is in the &s;ober
and &s;erious hou&s;e of mourning that the tide
of vanity is made to turn, and a new di|rection
given to the current of thought.
When &s;ome affecting incident pre&s;ents a
&s;trong di&s;covery of the dec$itfulne&s;s of all
worldly joy, and rou&s;es our &s;en&s;ibility to
human woe; when we behold tho&s;e with
whom we had lately mingled in the hou&s;e
of fea&s;ting, &s;unk by &s;ome of the &s;udden
vici&s;&s;itudes of li$e into the vale of mi&s;ery;
or when, in &s;ad &s;ilence, we &s;tand by the
friend whom we had loved as our own &s;oul,
&s;tretched on the bed of death; then is the
<PB N="377" REF="384">
&s;ea&s;on when the world begins to appear in a
new light; when the heart opens to virtu|ous
&s;entiments, and is led into that train of
reflection which ought to direct life. He
who before knew not what it was to com|mune
with his heart on any &s;erious &s;ubject,
now puts the que&s;tion to him&s;elf, for what
purpo&s;e he was &s;ent forth into this mortal,
tran&s;itory &s;tate; what his fate is likely to
be when it concludes; and what judgment
he ought to form of tho&s;e plea&s;ures which
amu&s;e for a little, but which, he now &s;ees,
cannot &s;ave the heart from angui&s;h in the
evil day. Touched by the hand of thought|ful
melancholy, that airy edifice of bli&s;s
which fancy had rai&s;ed up for him, vani&s;hes
away. He beholds in the place of it, the
lonely and barren de&s;ert, in which, &s;ur|rounded
with many a di&s;agreeable object,
he is left mu$ing upon him&s;elf. The time
which he has mi&s;-&s;pent, and the faculties
which he has mi&s;employed, his fooli&s;h le|vity
and his criminal pur&s;uits, all ri&s;e in
painful pro&s;pect before him. That un|known
&s;tate of exi&s;tence into which, race
<PB N="378" REF="385">
after race, the children of men pa&s;s, &s;trikes
his mind with &s;olemn awe.&mdash;Is there no
cour&s;e by which he can re$$ieve his pa&s;t er|rours?
Is there no &s;uperiour power to
which he can look up for aid? Is there no
plan of conduct which, if it exempt him
not from &s;orrow, can at lea&s;t procure him
con&s;olation amid&s;t the di&s;tre&s;sful exigencies
of life?&mdash;Such meditations as the&s;e, &s;ug|ge&s;ted
by the hou&s;e of mourning, fre|quently
produce a change on the whole
character. They revive tho&s;e &s;parks of
goodne&s;s which were nigh being quite ex|tingui&s;hed
in the di&s;&s;ipated mind; and give
ri&s;e to principles of conduct more rational
in them&s;elves, and more &s;uitable to the hu|man
&s;tate.</P>
<P>IN the &s;econd place, impre&s;&s;ions of this
nature not only produce moral &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s,
but awaken &s;entiments of piety, and bring
men into the &s;anctuary of religion. One
might, indeed, imagine that the ble&s;&s;ings
of a pro&s;perous condition would prove the
mo&s;t natural incitements to devotion; and
<PB N="379" REF="386">
that when men were happy in them&s;elves,
and &s;aw nothing but happine&s;s around them,
they could not fail gratefully to acknow|ledge
that God who <HI>giveth them all things
richly to enjoy.</HI> Yet &s;uch is their corruption,
that they are never more ready to forget
their benefactor, than when loaded with his
benefits. The giver is concealed form their
carele&s;s and inattentive view, by the cloud
of his own gifts. When their life conti|nues
to flow in one &s;mooth current, un|ruffled
by any griefs; when they neither
receive in their own circum&s;tances, nor al|low
them&s;elves to receive from the circum|&s;tances
of others, any admonitions of hu|man
in&s;tability, they not only become
regardle&s;s of Providence, but are in hazard
of contemning it. Glorying in their &s;trength,
and lifted up by the pride of life into &s;up|po&s;ed
independence, that impious &s;enti|ment,
if not uttered by the mouth, yet too
often lurks in the hearts of many, during
their flouri&s;hing periods, <HI>What is the Al|mighty
that we &s;hould &s;erve him, and what
profit &s;hould we have if we pray unto him?</HI></P>
<P><PB N="380" REF="387">
If &s;uch be the tendency of the hou&s;e of
fea&s;ting, how nece&s;&s;ary is it that, by &s;ome
change in their &s;ituation, men &s;hould be
obliged to enter into the hou&s;e of mourn|ing,
in order to recover a proper &s;en&s;e of
their dependent &s;tate? It is there, when
for&s;aken by the gaieties of the world, and
left alone with God, that we are made to
perceive how awful his government is; how
ea&s;ily human greatne&s;s bends before him;
and how quickly all our de&s;igns and mea|&s;ures,
at his interpo&s;al, vani&s;h into no|thing.
There, when the countenance is
&s;ad, and the affections are $$oftened by grief;
when we $it apart, involved in &s;erious
thought, looking down as from &s;ome emi|nence
n tho&s;e dark clouds that hang over
the life of man, he arrogance of pro&s;perity
is humbled, and the heart melts under the
impre&s;&s;ions of religion. Formerly we were
taught, but now we &s;ee, we feel, how
much we &s;tand in need of an Almighty
protector, amid&s;t the changes of this vain
world. Our &s;oul cleaves to him who <HI>de|&s;pi&s;es
not, nor abhors the affliction of the
<PB N="381" REF="388">
afflicted.</HI> Prayer flows forth of its own ac|cord
from the relenting heart, that he may
be our God, and the God of our friends in
di&s;tre&s;s; that he may never for&s;ake us while
we are &s;ojourning in this land of pilgrim|age;
may &s;trengthen us under its cala|mities,
and bring us hereafter to tho&s;e ha|bitations
of re&s;t, where we, and they whom
we love, may be delivered from the trials
which all are now doomed to endure. The
di&s;coveries of his mercy which he has made
in the go&s;pel of Chri&s;t, are viewed with
joy, as &s;o many rays of light &s;ent down
from above to di&s;pel, in &s;ome degree, the
&s;urrounding gloom. A mediator an in|terce&s;&s;or
with the Sovereign of the Uni|ver&s;e,
appear comfortable names; and the
re&s;urrection of the ju&s;t becomes the power|ful
cordial of grief. In &s;uch moments as
the&s;e, which we may ju&s;tly call happy mo|ments,
the &s;oul participates of all the plea|&s;ures
of devotion. It feels the power of
religion to &s;upport and relieve. It is &s;oft|ened,
without being broken. It is full,
and it pours it&s;elf forth; pours it&s;elf forth,
<PB N="382" REF="389">
if we may be allowed to u&s;e the expre&s;&s;ion,
into the bo&s;om of its merciful Creator.</P>
<P>IN the third place, &s;uch &s;eriours &s;enti|ments
produce the happie&s;t $$$ect upon our
di&s;po&s;ition towards our fellow-creatures, as
well as towards God. It is a common and
ju&s;t ob&s;ervation, that they who have lived
always in affluence and ea&s;e, &s;trangers to
the mi&s;eries of life, are liable to contract
hardne&s;s of heart with re&s;pect to all the
concerns of others. Wrapped up in them|&s;elves,
and their own plea&s;ures, they be|hold
with indifference the mo&s;t affecting
&s;cenes of di&s;tre&s;s. Habituated to indulge
all their de&s;ires without controul, they be|come
impatient of the lea&s;t provocation or
offence; and are ready to trample on their
in&s;erious, as if they were creatures of a
different &s;pecies form them&s;elves. Is this
an amiable temper, or &s;uch as becomes a
man? When appearing in others, do we
not view it with much di&s;plea&s;ure? When
imputed to our&s;elves, can we avoid account|ing
it a &s;evere reproach?</P>
<P><PB N="383" REF="390">
By the experience of di&s;tre&s;s, this arro|gant
in&s;en&s;ibility of temper is mo&s;t effec|tually
corrected; as the remembrance of
our own &s;ufferings naturally prompts us to
feel for others when they &s;uffer. But if
Providence has been &s;o kind as not to &s;ub|ject
us to much of this di&s;cipline in our own
lot, let us draw improvement from the
harder lot of others. Let us &s;ometimes &s;tep
a&s;ide from the &s;mooth and flowery paths
in which we are permitted to walk, in
order to view the toil&s;ome march of our
fellows through the thorny de&s;ert. By vo|luntarily
going into the hou&s;e of mourning;
by yielding to the &s;entiments which it ex|cites,
and mingling our tears with tho&s;e of
the afflicted, we &s;hall acquire that humane
&s;en&s;ibility, which is one of the hige&s;t orna|ments
of the nature of man. Perceiving
how much the common di&s;tre&s;&s;es of life
place us all on a level, and render the high
and the low, the rich and the poor, com|panions
in misfortune and mortality, we
&s;hall learn to &s;et no man at nought, and,
lea&s;t of any, our afflicted brother. Preju|dices
<PB N="384" REF="391">
will be extingui&s;hed, and benevo|lence
opened and enlarged, when looking
around on the multitude of men, we con|&s;ider
them as a band of fellow-travellers
in the valley of woe, where it ought to be
the office of every one to alleviate, as much
as po&s;&s;ible, the common burden.&mdash;While
the vain and the licentious are revelling in
the mid&s;t of extravagance and riot, how
little do they think of tho&s;e &s;cenes of &s;ore
di&s;tre&s;s which are going on at that moment
throughout the world; multitudes &s;trug|gling
for a poor &s;ub&s;i&s;tence to &s;upport the
wife and the children whom they love, and

that bread which they can hardly procure;
multitudes groaning under &s;ickne&s;s in de|&s;olate
cottages, untended and unmourned;
many, apparently in a better &s;ituation of
life, pining away in &s;ecret with concealed
griefs; families weeping over the beloved

May we not appeal to the heart of every

natural feelings, whether the admi&s;&s;ion of
&s;uch views of human life might not, &s;ome|times

which Solomon compares to <HI>the crackling

jollity in the hou&s;e of fea&s;ting are often
forced form a troubled mind; like fla&s;hes
from the black cloud, which, after a mo|mentary
effulgence, are &s;ucceeded by thicker
darkne&s;s. Whereas compa&s;&s;ionate affec|tions,
even at the time when they draw
tears from our eyes for human mi&s;ery,
convey &s;atisfaction to the heart. The gra|cious
appointment of Heaven has ordained
that &s;ympathetic pains &s;hould always be
accompanied with a certain degree of plea|&s;ure;
on purpo&s;e that we might be more

intere&s;ted in the ca&s;e of the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, and
that by this my&s;terious bond, man might
be linked clo&s;er to man. The inward &s;a|tisfaction
which belongs to the compa&s;&s;io|onate
affections is, at the &s;ame time, height|ened
by the approbation which they receive
from our rea&s;on; and by the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s
which they afford us of feeling what men
and Chri&s;tians ought to feel.</P>
<P>IN the fourth place, the di&s;po&s;ition re|commended
in the text, not only improves
us in piety and humanity, but likewi&s;e
a&s;&s;i&s;ts us in &s;elf-government, and the due
moderation of our de&s;ires. The hou&s;e of
mourning is the &s;chool of temperance and
&s;obriety. Every wi&s;e man will find it for
his intere&s;t to enter into it &s;ometimes of his
own accord, le&s;t otherwi&s;e he be compelled
to take up his dwelling there. Sea&s;onable in|terruptions
of our plea&s;ures are nece&s;&s;ary to
their prolongation. For, continued &s;cenes
of luxury and indulgence ha&s;ten to a me|lancholy
i&s;&s;ue. The hou&s;e of fea&s;ting too
often becomes an avenue to the hou&s;e of
<PB N="387" REF="394">
mourning. Short, to the licentious, is the
interval between them; and &s;peedy the
tran&s;ition from the one to the other.</P>
<P>But &s;uppo&s;ing that, by prudent manage|ment,
the men of plea&s;ure could avoid the
pernicious effects which intemperance and
di&s;&s;olutene&s;s are likely to produce on their
health, or their fortune, can they al&s;o pre|vent
tho&s;e di&s;orders which &s;uch habits will
introduce into their minds? Can they
e&s;cape that wrath of the Almighty, which
will. infallibly pur&s;ue them for their &s;ins
both here and hereafter? For whence, &s;o
much as from the unchecked pur&s;uit of
plea&s;ure, do all tho&s;e crimes ari&s;e which
&s;tain the characters of men with the deepe&s;t
guilt, and expo&s;e them to the &s;evere&s;t judg|ments
of Heaven? Whence, then, is the
corrective of tho&s;e mi&s;chiefs to be &s;ought,
but form &s;uch a di&s;cipline as &s;hall moderate
that intemperate admiration of the world
which gave ri&s;e to the evil? By repairing
&s;ometimes to the hou&s;e of mourning, you
would cha&s;ten the loo&s;ene&s;s of fancy, abate
the eagerne&s;s of pa&s;&s;ion, and afford &s;cope to
<PB N="388" REF="395">
rea&s;on for exerting here re&s;training powers.
You would behold this world &s;tripped of
its fal&s;e colours, and reduced to its proper
level. Many an important in&s;truction you
would receive from the humiliation of the
proud, the mortification of the vain, and
the &s;ufferings of the voluptuous, which you
would &s;ee exemplified before you, in the
chambers of &s;orrow, of &s;ickne&s;s, and of
death. You would then be taught <HI>to re|joice
as though you rejoiced not, and to weep
as though you weeped not;</HI> that is, neither
in joy, nor in grief, to run to exce&s;s; but
<HI>to u&s;e this world &s;o as not to abu&s;e it;</HI> con|templating
<HI>the fa&s;hion thereof as pa&s;&s;ing
away.</HI></P>
<P>Moreover, you would there learn the
important le&s;&s;on of &s;uiting your mind, be|fore-hand,
to what you had rea&s;on to ex|pect
from the world; a le&s;&s;on too &s;eldom
&s;tudied by mankind, and to the neglect of
which, much of their mi&s;ery, and much of
their guilty, is to be charged. By turning
away their eyes from the dark &s;ide of life;
by looking at the world only in one light,
<PB N="389" REF="396">
and that a flattering one, they form their
mea&s;ures on fal&s;e plan, and are nece&s;&s;a|rily
deceived and betrayed. Hence, the
vexation of &s;ucceeding di&s;appointment and
bla&s;ted hope. Hence, their criminal impa|tience
of life, and their bitter accu&s;ations of
God and man; when, in truth, they have
rea&s;on to accu&s;e only their own folly.&mdash;
Thou who would&s;t act like a wi&s;e man, and
build thy hou&s;e on the rock, and not on the
&s;and, contemplate human life not only in
the &s;un&s;hine, but in the &s;hade. Frequent
the hou&s;e of mourning, as well as the hou&s;e
of mirth. Study the nature of that &s;tate in
which thou art placed; and balance its joys
with its &s;orrows. Thou &s;ee&s;t that the cup
which is held forth to the whole human
race, is mixed. Of its bitter ingredients,
expect that thou art to drink thy portion.
Thou &s;ee&s;t the &s;torm hovering every where
in the clouds around thee. Be not &s;urpri&s;ed
if on they head it &s;hall break. Lower, there|fore,
thy &s;ails. Di&s;mi&s;s thy florid hopes;
and come forth prepared either to act or to
&s;uffer, according as Heaven &s;hall decree.
<PB N="390" REF="397">
Thus &s;halt thou be excited to take the pro|pere&s;t
mea&s;ures for defence, by endeavour|ing
to &s;ecure an intere&s;t in His $avour, who,
<HI>in the time of trouble, can hide thee in his
pavilion.</HI> Thy mind &s;hall adju&s;t it&s;elf to
follow the order of his providence. Thou
&s;halt be enabled, with equanimity and &s;tea|dine&s;s,
to hold thy cour&s;e through life. Fi|nally,</P>
<P>IN the fifth place, by accu&s;toming our|&s;elves
&s;uch &s;erious views of life, our ex|ce&s;&s;ive
fondne&s;s for life it&s;elf will be mo|derated,
and our minds gradually formed
to wi&s;h and to long for a better world. If
we know that our continuance here is to be
&s;hort, and that we are intended by our
Maker for a more la&s;ting &s;tate, and for em|ployments
of a nature altogether different
from tho&s;e which now occupy the bu&s;y, or
amu&s;e the vain, we mu&s;t &s;urely be con|vinced,
that it is of the highe&s;t con&s;equence
to prepare our&s;elves for &s;o important a
change. This view of our duty is fre|quently
held up to us in the &s;acred writings$
<PB N="391" REF="398">
and hence religion becomes, though not a
moro&s;e, yet a grave and &s;olemn principle,
calling off the attention of men from light
pur&s;uits, to tho&s;e which are of eternal mo|ment.
<HI>What is a man profited if he &s;hall
gain the whole world, and lo&s;e his own &s;oul;</HI>
if he &s;hall lead a life of thoughtle&s;s mirth
on earth, and exclude him&s;elf from eternal
felicity in heaven? Worldly affection, and
&s;en&s;ual plea&s;ure, depre&s;s all our higher powers.
They form an unnatural union between the
human &s;oul and this earth, which was only
de&s;igned for its temporary abode. They
attach it too &s;trongly to objects from which
it mu&s;t shortly part. They alienate its de|&s;ires
from God and heaven, and deject it
with &s;lavi&s;h and unmanly fears of death
Whereas, by the di&s;cipline of religious &s;e|riou&s;ne&s;s,
it is gradually loo&s;ened from the
fetters of &s;en&s;e. A&s;&s;i&s;ted to di&s;cover the
vanity of this world, it ri&s;es above it; and
in the hours of &s;ober thought, cultivates con|nection
with tho&s;e divine and immortal ob|jects,
among which it is de&s;igned to dwell.</P>
<P><PB N="392" REF="399">
ENOUGH has now been &s;aid to convince
any thinking per&s;on of the ju&s;tice, and rea|&s;onablene&s;s,
of the maxims in the text; and
to &s;how, that, on various occa&s;ions, <HI>&s;orrow</HI>
may be <HI>better than laughter.</HI> Would&s;t thou
acquire the habit of recollection, and fix the
$$inciples of thy conduct; would&s;t thou be
$ed up to thy Creator and Redeemer, and
be formed to &s;entiments of piety and devo|tion;
would&s;t thou be acquainted with tho&s;e
mild and tender affections which delight the
compa&s;&s;ionate and humane; would&s;t thou
have the power of &s;en&s;ual appetities tamed
and corrected, and thy &s;oul rai&s;ed above the
ignoble love of life, and fear of death? Go,
my brother, go&mdash;not to &s;cenes of plea&s;ure

Contemplate the lifele&s;s remains of what
once was fair and flouri&s;hing. Bring home
to thy&s;elf the vici&s;&s;itudes of life. Recal the
remembrance of the friend, the parent, or
the child, whom thou tenderly loved&s;t. Look
<PB N="393" REF="400">
back on the days of former years; and think
on the companions of thy youth, who now

as &s;hall enable thee to enjoy, with
more real advantage, the re&s;t of life. Di&s;|po&s;itions
of this nature form one part of
the character of tho&s;e <HI>mourners</HI> whom our
Saviour hath pronounced <HI>ble&s;&s;ed;</HI> and of
tho&s;e to whom it is promi&s;ed, that <HI>&s;owing
in tears they &s;hall reap in joy</HI><NOTE N="+" PLACE="foot">Matth. v. 4. P&s;alm cxxvi. 5.</NOTE>. A great
difference there is between being &s;erious
and melancholy; and a melancholy too
there is of that kind which de&s;erves to be
&s;ometimes indulged.</P>
<P>Religion hath, on the whole, provided
for every good man abundant materials of
con&s;olation and relief. How dark &s;oever
<PB N="394" REF="401">
the pre&s;ent face of nature may appear, it
di&s;pels the darkne&s;s, when it brings into
view the entire &s;y&s;tem of things, and ex|tends
our &s;urvey to the whole kingdom of
God. It repre&s;ents what we now behold
as only a part, and a &s;mall part, of the ge|neral
order. It a&s;&s;ures us, that though here,
for wi&s;e ends, mi&s;ery and &s;orrow are per|mitted
to have place, the&s;e temporary evils
&s;hall, in the end, advance the happine&s;s of
all who love God, and are faithful to their
duty. It &s;hows them this mixed and con|fu&s;ed
&s;cene vani&s;hing by degrees away, and
preparing the introduction of that &s;tate, where
the hou&s;e of mourning &s;hall be &s;hut up for
ever; where no tears are &s;een, and no
groans heard; where no hopes are fru&s;|trated,
and no virtuous connections di&s;|&s;olved;
but where, under the light of the
divine countenance, goodne&s;s &s;hall flouri&s;h
in perpetual felicity. Thus, though reli|gion
may occa&s;ionally cha&s;ten our mirth
with &s;adne&s;s of countenance, yet under that
&s;adne&s;s it allows not the hearts of good men
to &s;ink. It calls upon them to rejoice, <HI>be|cau&s;e
<PB N="395" REF="402">
the Lord reigneth who is their rock, and
the mo&s;t high God who is their Redeemer.</HI>
Rea&s;on likewi&s;e joins her voice with that of
religion; forbidding us to make peevi&s;h and
unrea&s;onable complaints of human life, or
injuriou&s;ly to a&s;cribe to it more evil than it
contains. Mixed as the pre&s;ent &s;tate is,
&s;he pronounces, that generally, if not al|ways,
there is more happine&s;s than mi&s;ery,
more plea&s;ure than pain, in the condition

<P>THIS P&s;alm appears to have been
compo&s;ed on occa&s;ion of &s;ome re|markable
delivernace obtained bythe Jewi&s;h
nation<NOTE PLACE="marg">SERM. XIV.</NOTE>. It is generally under&s;tood to have
been written in the reign of Hezekiah, and
to refer to the formidable inva&s;ion of Judaea
by Sennacherib; when the angel of the
Lord, in one night, di&s;comfited the whole
A&s;&s;yrian ho&s;t, and &s;mote them with &s;udden
de&s;truction. To this interpo&s;ition of the

the arrows of the bow, the &s;hield, the &s;word,
and the battle. The &s;tout-hearted are &s;poiled;
they have &s;lept their &s;leep; and none of the
men of might have found their bands. At
thy rebuke, O God of Jacob, both the chariot
and the hor&s;e are ca&s;t into a dead &s;leep.</HI> In
the text, we have the wi&s;e and religious
reflection of the P&s;almi&s;t upon the violent
de&s;igns which had been carried on by the
enemies of his country, and upon the i&s;&s;ue
to which Providence had brought them.
<HI>Surely, the wrath of man &s;hall prai&s;e thee.</HI>
By <HI>the wrath of man,</HI> we are to under&s;tand
all that the impetuo&s;ity of human pa&s;&s;ions
can devi&s;e or execute; the projects of am|bition
and re&s;entment, the rage of per&s;ecu|tion,
the fury of war; the di&s;orders which
violence produces in private life, and the
public commotions which it excites in the
world. All the&s;e &s;hall <HI>prai&s;e God,</HI> not with
their intention and de&s;ign, nor by their na|tive
tendency; but by tho&s;e wi&s;e and good
purpo&s;es, which his providence makes them
<PB N="398" REF="405">
accompli&s;h; from their poi&s;on extracting
health, and converting things which in
them&s;elves are prenicious, into in&s;truments
of his glory, and of public benefit: So that,
though <HI>the wrath of man worketh not the
righteou&s;ne&s;s of God,</HI> it is neverthele&s;s forced
and compelled to mini&s;ter to his prai&s;e.
The P&s;almi&s;t adds, <HI>the remainder of wrath
&s;halt thou re&s;train;</HI> that is, God will allow
&s;cope to the wrath of man as far as it an|&s;wers
his good purpo&s;es, and is &s;ub&s;ervient
to his prai&s;e; the re&s;t of it &s;hall be curbed
and bound up. When it would attempt to
go beyond its pre&s;cribed limit, the &s;ays to it,
as to the waters of the ocean, <HI>Hitherto &s;halt
thou come, but no further; and here &s;hall thy
proud waves be &s;tayed.</HI></P>
<P>All this &s;hall be fully verified and de|clared
by the la&s;t i&s;&s;ue of things; when we
&s;hall be able more clearly to trace the di|vine
admini&s;tration through its &s;everal &s;teps,
by &s;eeing the con&s;ummation of the; whole.
In &s;ome ca&s;es, it may be re&s;erved for this
period, to unfold the my&s;terious wi&s;dom
of Heaven. But in general, as much of
<PB N="399" REF="406">
the divine conduct is at pre&s;ent manife&s;t,
as gives ju&s;t ground for the a&s;&s;ertion in the
text. In the &s;equel of this di&s;cour&s;e, I &s;hall
endeavour to; illu&s;trate and confirm it. I
&s;hall &s;how in what manner the wrath of
man is made to prai&s;e the power, the wi&s;|dom,
the ju&s;tice, and the goodne&s;s of God.</P>
<P>I BEGIN with this ob&s;ervation, That in
order to accompli&s;h the great purpo&s;es car|ried
on by the Government of the Univer&s;e,
it is nece&s;&s;ary that the divine perfections be
di&s;played before mankind, in a &s;en&s;ible and
&s;triking manner. We are not to conceive
the Supreme Being as hereby &s;eeking prai&s;e
to lhim&s;elf, from a principle of o&s;tentation or
vain glory. Independent and &s;elf-&s;ufficient,
he re&s;ts in the enjoyment of his own beati|tude.
His prai&s;e con&s;i&s;ts in the general
order and welfare of his creation. This
end cannot be attained, unle&s;s mankind be
made to feel the &s;ubjection under which
they are placed. They mu&s;t be taught to
admire and adore their &s;overeign. They
mu&s;t be overawed by the view of a high
<PB N="400" REF="407">
hand, which can at plea&s;ure controul their
actions, and render them &s;ub&s;ervient to
purpo&s;es which they neither fore&s;aw nor
intended. Hence the propriety of God's
making <HI>the wrath of man to prai&s;e him.</HI>
We ea&s;ily conceive in what manner the
heavens and the earth are &s;aid to prai&s;e
God, as they are &s;tanding monuments of
that &s;upreme perfection which is di&s;played
in their creation. The virtues of good
men obviou&s;ly prai&s;e him, by exhibiting
his image, and reflecting back his glory.
But when even the vices and inordinate
pa&s;&s;ions of bad men are made to prai&s;e him,
in con&s;equence of the u&s;eful purpo&s;es which
they are compelled to accompli&s;h, this, in
particular manner, di&s;tingui&s;hes and &s;ig|nalizes
a divine hand; this opens a more
wonderful pro&s;pect of the admini&s;tration of
Heaven, than if all its &s;ubjects had been
loyal and willingly obedient, and the cour&s;e
of human affairs had proceeded in a quiet
and regualr tenour.</P>
<P><PB N="401" REF="408">
I. THE <HI>wrath of man</HI> redounds to the
prai&s;e of divine power. It brings it forth
with full and awful lu&s;tre, to the view of
mankind. To reign with &s;overeign com|mand
amid&s;t the mo&s;t turbulent and di&s;or|dered
&s;tate of things, both in the natural
and moral world, is the peculiar glory of
omnipotence. Hence God is de&s;cribed in
Scripture as <HI>&s;itting on the flood, riding on the
wings of the wind, dwelling in the darkne&s;s
and the tempe&s;t;</HI> that is, making the mo&s;t
violent powers in the univer&s;e mini&s;ter to
his will, giving them &s;cope, or re&s;training
them, according as &s;uits the purpo&s;es of his
dominion. As <HI>he &s;tills,</HI> at his plea&s;ure, <HI>the
raging of the &s;eas, and the noi&s;e of their
waves,</HI> in like manner, <HI>he &s;tills the tumults
of the people.</HI> When the pa&s;&s;ions of men
are mo&s;t inflamed, and their de&s;igns ju&s;t
ripe for bur&s;ting into execution, often, by
&s;ome unexpected interpo&s;ition, he calls
upon the world to ob&s;erve that there is one
higher than the highe&s;t on earth, who can
fru&s;trate their devices in a moment, and
command <HI>the earth to be &s;till before him.</HI>
<PB N="402" REF="409">
Proud fleets, de&s;tined to carry de&s;truction
to neighbouring kingdoms, may cover the
ocean. He blows with his wind, and they
are &s;cattered. Mighty armies may go forth
to the field in all the glory of human
&s;trength; but the i&s;&s;ues of battle are with
him. He &s;u&s;pends on high the invi&s;ible
balance which weighs the fate of nations.
According as the &s;$ale inclines, he gives to
&s;ome &s;light event the power of deciding the
conte&s;t. He clouds the &s;ky with darkne&s;s,
or opens the windows of heaven to let
forth their flood. He dejects the hearts of
the brave with &s;udden terrour, and render,
the hands of the &s;trong weak and unper|forming,

un&s;een mini&s;ters &s;tand ready to be the
in&s;truments of his power, in humbling the
pride, and checking the efforts of the wrath
of man. Thus, in the in&s;tance of haughty
Sennacherib, and that boa&s;ted tempe&s;t of
wrath which he threatened to pour upon
all the Jewi&s;h nation; <HI>I will put my hook,</HI>
&s;ays the Almighty, <HI>in thy no&s;e, and my bridle

imagine a vain thing; when the kings of

the train of events in &s;uch a manner,
that the unruly pa&s;&s;ions of the wicked &s;hall
contribute to overthrow their own de&s;igns.
Hi&s;tory abounds with examples of their
being rendered the uncon&s;cious mini&s;ters of
Providence, to accompli&s;h purpo&s;es directly
oppo&s;ite to tho&s;e which they had in view.
Thus the cruelty of the &s;ons of Jacob, in
pur&s;uing the de&s;truction of their brother
<PB N="404" REF="411">
Jo&s;eph, became the means of effecting his
high advancement. Thus the wrath of
Pharaoh again&s;t the I&s;raelites, and his un|ju&s;t
attempts to detain them in bondage,
proved the occa&s;ion of bringing them forth
from the land of &s;lavery, with &s;ignal mark$
of the favour of Heaven. Thus the inhu|man
plan which Haman had formed for
r$ining Mordecai, and extirpating the
whole Jewi&s;h nation, paved the way for
Mordecai's high promotion, and for the
triumph of the Jews over all their ene|mies.</P>
<P>After this manner the Almighty <HI>&s;nareth
the wicked in the works of their hands;</HI> and
erects his own coun&s;el upon the ruin of
theirs. Tho&s;e events which, viewed apart,
appear as &s;pots in the divine admini&s;tration,
when con&s;idered in connection with all
their con&s;equences, are often found to give
it additional lu&s;tre. The beauty and mag|nificence
of the univer&s;e are much height|ened,
by its being and exten&s;ive and compli|cated
&s;y&s;tem; in which a variety of &s;prings
are made to play, and a multitude of dif|ferent
<PB N="405" REF="412">
movements are, with mo&s;t admirable
art, regulated and kept in order. Inter|fering
intere&s;ts, and jarring pa&s;&s;ions, are in
&s;uch manner balanced again&s;t one another;
&s;uch proper checks are placed on the vio|lence
of human pur&s;uits; and the <HI>wrath of
man</HI> is made &s;o to hold its cour&s;e, that how
oppo&s;ite &s;oever the &s;everal motions &s;eem to
be, yet they concur and meet at la&s;t in
one direction. While, among the multi|tudes
that well on the face of the earth,
&s;ome are &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive to the divine authority;
&s;ome ri&s;e up in rebellion again&s;t it; others,
ab&s;orbed in their plea&s;ures and pur&s;uits, are
totally inattentive to it; they are all &s;o
moved by an imperceptible influence from
above, that the zeal of the dutiful, the
wrath of the rebellious, and the indifference
of the carele&s;s, contribute finally to the
glory of God. All are governed in &s;uch a
way as &s;uits their powers, and is con&s;i&s;tent
with rational freedom, yet all are &s;ubjected
to the nece&s;&s;ity of fulfilling the eternal
purpo&s;es of Heaven. This depth of di|vine
wi&s;dom in the admini&s;tration of the
<PB N="406" REF="413">
univer&s;e, exceeds all human comprehen|&s;ion,
and affords everla&s;ting &s;ubject of ado|ration
and prai&s;e.</P>
<P>III. THE <HI>wrath of man</HI> prai&s;es the ju&s;tice
of God, by being employed as the in&s;tru|ment
of inflicting puni&s;hment upon &s;inners.
Did bad men trace the cour&s;e of events in
their life with attentive eye, they might
ea&s;ily di&s;cover the greate&s;t part of the di&s;|a&s;ters
which they &s;uffer to be brought upon
them by their own ungoverned pa&s;&s;ions.
The &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of cau&s;es and effects is &s;o
contrived by Providence, that the wrath
which they meant to pour forth on others,
frequently recoils, by its effects, upon them|&s;lves.
But &s;uppo&s;ing them to e&s;cape tho&s;e
external mi&s;chiefs which violent pa&s;&s;ions na|turally
occa&s;ion, they cannot evade the in|ternal
mi&s;ery which they produce. The
con&s;titution of things is framed with &s;uch
profound wi&s;dom, that the divine laws, in
every event, execute them&s;elves again&s;t
the &s;inner, and carry their &s;anction in their
own bo&s;om. The Supreme Being has no
<PB N="407" REF="414">
occa&s;ion to unlock the pri&s;ons of the deep,
or to call down the thunder from heaven,
in order to puni&s;h the <HI>wrath of man.</HI> He
carries on the admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice with
more &s;implicity, and dignity. It is &s;ufficient
that he allow tho&s;e fierce pa&s;&s;ions which
render bad men the di&s;turbers of others, to
operate on their own hearts. He delivers
them up to them&s;elves, and they become
their own tormentors. Before the world
they may di&s;gui&s;e their &s;ufferings; but it is
well known, that to be inwardly torn with
de&s;pite, revenge and wrathful pa&s;&s;ions, is
the mo&s;t inten&s;e of all mi&s;ery. In thus con|necting
the puni&s;hment with the crime,
making their <HI>own wickedne&s;s to reprove
them, and their back&s;lidings to correct them,</HI>
the avenging hand of a righteous Gover|nour
is con&s;picuous; and thus the ob&s;erva|tion
of the P&s;almi&s;t is fully verified; <HI>the
wicked have drawn out their &s;word and
bent their bow, to c$&s;t down the poor and
needy: but their &s;word &s;hall enter into their
own heart</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">P&s;alm xxxvii. 1$&punc; 15.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="408" REF="415">
The <HI>wrath of man</HI> al&s;o prai&s;es the ju&s;tice
of God in the puni&s;hment of other crimi|nals,
as well as of the wrathful them&s;elves.
Ambitious and lawle&s;s men are let loo&s;e
upon each other, that without any &s;upper|natural
interpo&s;ition, they may fulfil the
ju&s;t vengeance of heaven in their mutual
de&s;truction. They may occa&s;ionally be
cemented together by con&s;piracy again&s;t
the ju&s;t; but as no firm nor la&s;ting bond
can unite them, they become at la&s;t the
prey of mutual jealou&s;y, &s;trife and fraud.
For a time they may go on, and &s;eem to
pro&s;per. The ju&s;tice of heaven may ap|pear
to &s;lumber; but it is awake; and only
waits till the mea&s;ure of their iniquity be
full. God repre&s;ents him&s;elf in Scripture
as &s;ometimes permitting wickedne&s;s to ari&s;e
to an overgrown height, on purpo&s;e that
its ruin may be greater, and more exem|plary.
He &s;ays to the tyrant of Egypt,
that <HI>for this cau&s;e he had rai&s;ed him up,</HI> that
is, had allowed him to pro&s;per and be ex|alted,
<HI>that he might &s;hew in him his power
and that his name might be declared through|out
<PB N="409" REF="416">
all the earth</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Exod. ix. 16.</NOTE>. The admini&s;tra|tion
is glorified in the puni&s;hment contrived
for the workers of iniquity, as well as in
the reward prepared for the righteous. <HI>This
is the purpo&s;e which the Lord hath purpo&s;ed
upon all the earth; and this is the hand that
is &s;tretched forth over all the nations</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">I&s;aiah xiv. 26.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IV. THE <HI>wrath of man</HI> is made to prai&s;e
the goodne&s;s of God. This is the mo&s;t
unexpected of its effects; and therefore
requires to be the mo&s;t fully illu&s;trated.
All the operations of the government of the
Deity may be ultimately re&s;olved into good|ne&s;s.
His power, and wi&s;dom, and ju&s;tice,
all conduce to general happine&s;s and order.
Among the means which he u&s;es for ac|compli&s;hing
this end, it will be found that
the wrath of man, through his over-ruling
direction, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es a con&s;iderable place.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, it is employed by God as an u&s;eful
in&s;trument of di&s;cipline and correction to
the virtuous. The &s;torms which ambition
and pride rai&s;e among mankind, he permits
<PB N="410" REF="417">
with the &s;ame intention that he &s;ends forth
tempe&s;ts among the elements; to clear the
atmo&s;phere of noxious vapours, and to pu|rify
it from that corruption which all things
contract by too much re&s;t. When wicked
men prevail in their de&s;igns, and exerci&s;e
the power which they have gained with a
heavy and oppre&s;&s;ive hand, the virtuous are
apt to exclaim, in bitterne&s;s of &s;oul, Where
is the Lord? and where the &s;ceptre of
righteou&s;ne&s;s and truth? <HI>Hath God forgotten
to be gracious?</HI> or doth he indeed &s;ee, and
<HI>is there knowledge in the mo&s;t high?</HI>&mdash;
Their oppre&s;&s;ors are, in truth, no more
than the mini&s;ters of God to them for good.
He &s;ees that they &s;tand in need of correction,
and therefore rai&s;es up enemies again&s;t them,
in order to cure the intemperance of pro|&s;perity;
and to produce, in the &s;erious
hours of affliction, proper reflections upon
their duty, and their pa&s;t errours.</P>
<P>In this light the di&s;turbers of the earth
are often repre&s;ented in Scripture; as
&s;courges in the hand of God, employed to
inflict cha&s;ti&s;ement upon a degenerating
<PB N="411" REF="418">
people. They are commi&s;&s;ioned for the
execution of righteous and wi&s;e purpo&s;es,
concealed from them&s;elves; and when their
commi&s;&s;ion is fulfilled, they are recalled, and
de&s;troyed. Of this we have a remarkable
example in the u&s;e which God made of the
king of A&s;&s;yria, with re&s;pect to the people
of I&s;rael. <HI>I will &s;end him again&s;t an hypo|critical
nation, and again&s;t the people of my
wrath will I give him a charge, to take the
&s;poil, and to take the prey. Howbeit, he
meaneth not &s;o; neither doth his heart think
&s;o; but it is in his heart to de&s;troy, and out
off nations not a few. Wherefore it &s;hall
come to pa&s;s, that when the Lord hath per|formed
his whole work upon mount Zion and
on Jeru&s;alem, I will puni&s;h the fruit of the
&s;tout heart of the king of A&s;&s;yria, and the glory
of his high looks</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">I&s;aiah x. 6, 7&punc; 12.</NOTE> In vain, then, doth the
<HI>wrath of man</HI> lift it&s;elf up again&s;t God. <HI>He
&s;aith, by the &s;trength of my hand I have done
it, and by my wi&s;dom, for I am prudent.
Shall the ax boa&s;t it&s;elf again&s;t him that h$w|eth
therewith? or &s;hall the &s;aw magnify it|&s;elf
<PB N="412" REF="419">
again&s;t him that &s;haketh it?</HI> All things,
whether they will it or not, mu&s;t <HI>work to|gether
for good to them that love God.</HI> The
<HI>wrath of man,</HI> among the re&s;t, fills up the
place a&s;&s;igned to it by the ordination of
Heaven. The violent enemy, the proud
conqueror, and the oppre&s;&s;ive tyrant, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;
only the &s;ame &s;tation with the famine, the
pe&s;tilence, and the flood. Their triumphs
are no more than the accompli&s;hment of
God's correction; <HI>and the remainder of their
wrath &s;hall $e re&s;train.</HI></P>
<P>SECONDLY, God makes the <HI>wrath of
man</HI> contribute to the benefit of the vir|tuous,
by rendering it the means of im|proving
and &s;ignalizing their graces; and of
rai&s;ing them, thereby, to higher honour and
glory. Had human affairs proceeded in an
orderly train, and no oppo&s;ition been made
to religion and virtue by the violence of the
wicked, what room would have been left
for &s;ome of the highe&s;t and mo&s;t generou$
exertions of the &s;oul of man? How many
&s;hining examples of fortitude, con&s;tancy,
<PB N="413" REF="420">
and patience, would have been lo&s;t to the
world? What a field of virtues peculiar to
a &s;tate of di&s;cipline had lain uncultivated?
Spirits of a higher order po&s;&s;e&s;s a &s;tate of
e&s;tabli&s;hed virtue, that &s;tands in need of no
&s;uch trials and improvements. But to us&punc;
who are only under education for &s;uch a
&s;tate, it belongs to pa&s;s through the furnace,
that our &s;ouls may be tried, re&s;ined, and
brightened. We mu&s;t &s;tand the conflict,
that we may be graced and crowned as con|querors.
The <HI>wrath of man</HI> opens the field
to glory; calls us forth to the mo&s;t di&s;tin|gui&s;hed
exerci&s;e of active virtue, and forms
us to all tho&s;e &s;uffering graces which are
among the highe&s;t ornaments of the human
&s;oul. It is thus, that the illu&s;trious band of
true patriots and heroes, of confe&s;&s;ors and
martyrs, have been &s;et forth to the admira|tion
of all ages, as <HI>lights of the world:</HI>
while the rage and fury of enemies, in&s;tead
of bearing them down, have only &s;erved to
exalt and dignify them more.</P>
<P>THIRDLY, the <HI>wrath of man</HI> is often
made to advance the temporal pro&s;perity of
<PB N="414" REF="421">
righteous. The occa&s;ional di&s;tre&s;&s;es which
it brings upon them frequently lay the foun|dation
of their future &s;ucce&s;s. The vio|lence
with which wicked men pur&s;ue their
re&s;entment, defeats its own purpo&s;e; and
engages the world on the &s;ide of the vir|tuous,
whom they per&s;ecute. The attempts
of malice to blacken and defame them,
bring forth their characters with more ad|vantage,
to the view of impartial beholder.
The extremities to which they are reduced
by inju&s;tice and oppre&s;&s;ion, rouze their cou|rage
and activity; and often give occa&s;ion
to &s;uch vigorous efforts in their ju&s;t defence,
as overcome all oppo&s;ition, and terminate
in pro&s;perity and &s;ucce&s;s. Even in ca&s;es
where the <HI>wrath of man</HI> appears to prevail
over the peaceable and the ju&s;t, it is fre|quently,
in its i&s;&s;ue, converted into a ble&s;|&s;ing.
How many have had rea&s;on to be
thankful, for being di&s;appointed by their
enemies in de&s;igns which they earne&s;tly
pur&s;ued, but which, if &s;ucce&s;sfully accom|pli&s;hed,
they have afterwards &s;een, would
have occa&s;ioned their ruin? <HI>who&s;o is wi&s;e
<PB N="415" REF="422">
and will ob&s;erve the&s;e things, even he &s;hall
under&s;tand the loving-kindne&s;s of the Lord</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">P&s;alm cvii. 34.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>While the <HI>wrath of man</HI> thus prai&s;es God
by the advantages which it is made to bring
to good men, as individuals, the divine hand
is equally apparent in the &s;imilar effects
wich it is appointed to produce to nations
and &s;ocieties. When wars and commo|tions
&s;hake the earth, when factions rage,
and inte&s;tine divi&s;ions embroil kingdoms
that before were flouri&s;hing, Providence
&s;eems, at fir&s;t view, to have abandoned
public affairs to the mi&s;rule of human pa&s;|&s;ions.
Yet from the mid&s;t of this confu&s;ion
order is often made to &s;pring; and from
the&s;e mi&s;chiefs la&s;ting advantages to ari&s;e.
By &s;uch convul&s;ions, nations are rouzed
from that dangerous lethargy into which
flowing wealth, long peace, and growing
effeminacy of manners had &s;uck them.
They are awakened to di&s;cern their true
intere&s;ts; and taught to take proper mea|&s;ures
for &s;ecurity and defence again&s;t all
their foes. Inveterate prejudices are cor|rected;
<PB N="416" REF="423">
and latent &s;ources of danger are
di&s;covered. Public &s;pirit is called forth;
and larger views of national happine&s;s are
formed. The corruptions to which every
government is liable, are often rectified by
a ferment in the political body, as noxious
humours in the animal frame are carried off
by the &s;hock of a di&s;ea&s;e. Attempts made
again&s;t a wi&s;e and well e&s;tabli&s;hed civil con|&s;titution,
tned in the i&s;&s;ue to &s;trengthen it;
and the di&s;orders of licentiou&s;ne&s;s and fac|tion,
teach men more highly to prize the
ble&s;&s;ings of tranquillity and legal protection.</P>
<P>FOURTHLY, the <HI>wrath of man,</HI> when it
breaks forth in the per&s;ecution of religion,
prai&s;es the divine goodne&s;s, by being ren|dered
conducive to the advancement of truth
and propagation of religion in the world.
The church of God, &s;ince the days of its
infancy, hath never been entirely exempted
from the wrath of the world; and in tho&s;e
ages, during which it was mo&s;t expo&s;ed to
that wrath, it hath always flouri&s;hed the
mo&s;t. In vain the policy and the rage of
<PB N="417" REF="424">
men united their efforts to extingui&s;h this
divine light. Though all the four winds
blew again&s;t it, it only &s;hone brighter,
and flamed higher. <HI>$Many waters could
not quench it, nor all the floods drown it.</HI>
The con&s;tancy and fortitude of tho&s;e who
&s;uffered for the truth, had a much greater
effect in increa&s;ing the number of converts,
than all the terror and cruelty of per&s;ecu|tors,
in dimini&s;hing it. By this means, the
<HI>wrath of man</HI> was made to turn again&s;t it|&s;elf,
to the de&s;truction of its won purpo&s;e;
like waves, which a&s;&s;aulting a rock with
impotent fury, di&s;cover its immoveable &s;ta|bility,
while they da&s;h them&s;elves in pieces
at its feet.</P>
<P>I SHALL only add one other in&s;tance of
the <HI>wrath of man</HI> prai&s;ing God, by accom|pli&s;hing
ends of mo&s;t exten&s;ive benefit to
mankind. Never did the rage and malice
of the wicked imagine that they had ob|tained
a more complete triumph, than in
the death of Je&s;us Chri&s;t. When they had
executed their purpo&s;e of making him &s;uffer
<PB N="418" REF="425">
as a malefactor, they were confident that
they had extingui&s;hed his name, and di&s;|comfited
his followers for ever. Behold
how feeble are the efforts of the wrath of
man again&s;t the decree of Heaven! All
that they intended to overthrow, they mo&s;t
effectually e&s;tabli&s;hed. The death of Chri&s;t
was, in the coun&s;els of Heaven, the spring of
everlasting life to the faithful. The cro&s;s
of everla&s;ting life to the faithful. The cro&s;s
on which he &s;uffered with apparent igno|miny,
became the &s;tandard of eternal honour
to him; the en&s;ign under which his fol|lowers
a&s;&s;embled, and triumphed. He who,
at his plea&s;ure, <HI>re&s;trains the remainder of
wrath,</HI> &s;uffered the rage of our Saviour's
enemies to &s;ugge&s;t no other things to them
than what, long before, He had determined,
and his prophets had foretold. They all
con&s;pired to render the whole &s;cene of
Chri&s;t's &s;ufferings exactly conformable to
the original, predicted plan of divine mercy
and goodne&s;s; and each of them contri|buted
his &s;hare to accompli&s;h that great un|dertaking,
which none of them in the lea&s;t
under&s;tood, nor meant to promote.&mdash;So
<PB N="419" REF="426">
remarkable an in&s;tance as this, fully a&s;cer|tained
in Scripture, of the <HI>wrath of man</HI>
mini&s;tering to the de&s;igns of Heaven, ought
to be frequently in our eye; as an exem|plification
of the conduct of Providence in
many other ca&s;es, where we have not &s;o
much light afforded us for tracing its ways.</P>
<P>By this induction of particulars, the doc|trine
contained in the text is plainly and
fully verified. We have &s;een, that the di&s;|orders
which the pride and pa&s;&s;ions of men
occai&s;on if the world, though they take ri&s;e
from the corruption of human nature in
this fallen &s;tate, yet are &s;o overruled by Pro|vidence,
as to redound to His honour and
glory who governs all. They illu&s;trate be|fore
the world the divine perfections in the
admini&s;tration of the univer&s;e. They &s;erve
the puro&s;es of moral and religious im|provement
to the &s;ouls of men. By a &s;ecret
tendency, they advance the welfare of tho&s;e
whom they appear to threaten with evil.
<HI>Surely, O God! the wrath of man &s;hall prai&s;e
thee: the remainder of wrath &s;halt thou re|&s;train.</HI>
<PB N="420" REF="427">
&mdash;In thy hand it is; and thou never
lette&s;t it forth but in weight and mea&s;ure.
It is wild and intractable in its nature; but
Thou tame&s;t it. It is blind and headlong
in its impul&s;e; but Thou directe&s;t it. It
&s;truggles continually to break its chain; but
Thou confine&s;t it; Thou retrenche&s;t all the
&s;uperfluity of its fury.&mdash;Let us now con|&s;ider,
what improvement is to be made of this
meditation on the ways of Providence.</P>
<P>IN the fir&s;t place, let it lead us to a reli|gious
contemplation of the hand of God
in all the tran&s;actions of the world. In the
ordinary cour&s;e of human affairs, we be|hold
a very mixed and bu&s;y &s;cene; the
pa&s;&s;ions of men variou&s;ly agitated, and new
changes daily taking place upon this &s;tage
of time. We behold peace and war alter|nately
returning; the fortunes of private
men ri&s;ing and falling; and &s;tates and na|tions
partaking of the &s;ame vici&s;&s;itude. In
all this, if we attend only to the operation
of external cau&s;es, and to the mere rotation
of events, we view no more than the ina|nimate
<PB N="421" REF="428">
part of nature; we &s;top at the &s;ur|face
of things; we contemplate the great
&s;pectacle which is pre&s;ented to us, not with
the eyes of rational and intelligent beings.
The life and beauty of the univer&s;e ari&s;es
from the view of that wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s
which animates and conducts the whole,
and unites all the parts in one great de|&s;ign.
There is an eternal mind who puts
all tho&s;e wheels in motion; him&s;elf remain|ing
for ever at re&s;t. Nothing is void of
God. Even in the pa&s;&s;ions and ragings of
men, He is to be found; and where they
imagine they guide them&s;elves, they are
guided and controuled by his hand. What
&s;olemn thoughts and devout affections ought
this meditation to in&s;pire; when in view|ing
the affairs of the world, we attend not
merely to the actings of men, but to the
ways of God; and con&s;ider our&s;elves, and
all our concerns, as included in is high
admini&s;tration!</P>
<P>IN the &s;econd place, the doctrine which
has been illu&s;trated &s;hould prevent us from
<PB N="422" REF="429">
cen&s;uring Providence, on account of any
&s;eeming di&s;orders and evils which at pre&s;ent
take place in the world. The various in|&s;tances
which have been pointed out in this
di&s;cour&s;e, of human pa&s;&s;ion and wickedne&s;s
rendered &s;ub&s;ervient to wi&s;e and u&s;eful ends,
give us the highe&s;t rea&s;on to conclude that,
in all other ca&s;es of &s;eeming evil, the like
ends are carried on. This ought to &s;atisfy
our mind, even when the pro&s;pect is mo&s;t
dark and di&s;couraging. The plans of di|vine
wi&s;dom are too large and comprehen|&s;ive
to be di&s;cerned by us in all their extent;
and where we &s;ee only by parts, we mu&s;t
frequently be at a lo&s;s in judging of the
whole. <HI>The way of God is in the &s;ea and
his path in the great waters; his foot&s;teps are
not known</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">P&s;alm lxxvii. 19.</NOTE>. <HI>But although thou &s;aye&s;t thou
can&s;t not &s;ee him, yet judgment is before him;
therefore tru&s;t thou in him</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Job, xxxv. 14.</NOTE> As in the
natural world, no real deformity is found,
nothing but what has either &s;ome orna|ment,

<PB N="423" REF="430">
the mo&s;t irregular and deformed appear|ances
contribute in one way or other to the
order of the whole. The Supreme Being,
from the mo&s;t oppo&s;ite and di&s;agreeing
principles, forms univer&s;al concord; and
adapts even the mo&s;t har&s;h and di&s;&s;onant
notes to the harmony of his prai&s;e. As he
hath reared the goodly frame of nature
from various and jarring elements, and
hath &s;ettled it in peace; &s;o he hath formed
&s;uch an union by his providence of the
more various intere&s;ts, and more jarring
pa&s;&s;ions of men, that they all con&s;pire to
his glory, and co-operate for general good.
&mdash;How amazing is that wi&s;dom, which
comprehends &s;uch infinite diver&s;ities, and
contrarieties, within its &s;cheme! How pow|erful
that hand, which bends to its own
purpo&s;e the good and the bad, the bu&s;y
and the idle, the friends and the foes of
truth; which obliges them all to hold on
their cour&s;e to his glory, though divided
from one another by a multiplicity of pur|&s;uits,
and differing often from them&s;elves;
and while they all move at their own free|dom,
<PB N="424" REF="431">
yet by a &s;ecret influence, winds and
turns them at his will! <HI>O the depth of the
riches, both of the wi&s;dom and knowledge of
God! How un&s;earchable are his judgments,
and his ways pa&s;t finding out</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Rom. xi. 33.</NOTE>!</P>
<P>IN the third place, we &s;ee, from what
has been &s;aid, how much rea&s;on there is
for &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the decrees of Heaven.
Whatever di&s;tre&s;&s;es we &s;uffer from the
<HI>wrath of man,</HI> we have ground to believe
that they befall not in vain. In the mid&s;t
of human violence, or oppre&s;&s;ion, we are
not left to be the &s;port of fortune. Higher
coun&s;els are concerned. Wi&s;e and good
de&s;igns are going on. God is always car|rying
forward his own purpo&s;es; and if
the&s;e terminate in his glory, which is ever
the &s;ame with felicity of the righteous,
is not this a &s;ufficient rea&s;on for our calm
and chearful acquie&s;cence?</P>
<P>Hence al&s;o, to conclude, ari&s;es the mo&s;t
powerful argument for &s;tudying, with zeal|ous
asis;duity, to gain the favour and pro|tection
<PB N="425" REF="432">
of the Almighty. If his di&s;plea&s;ure
hang over our heads, all things around us
may be ju&s;t objects of terrour. For again&s;t
him, there is no defence. The mo&s;t violent
powers in nature are mini&s;ters to him.
Formidable, indeed, may prove the <HI>wrath
of man,</HI> if he be plea&s;ed to let it forth
again&s;t us. To him, but not to us, it be|longs
to re&s;train it at plea&s;ure. Whereas,
when we are placed under his protection,
all human wrath is dive&s;ted of its terrours.
<HI>If he be for us, who</HI> or what <HI>can be again&s;t
us?</HI> Let us pur&s;ue the mea&s;ures which he
hath appointed for obtaining his grace by
faith, repentance and a holy life, and we
&s;hall have no rea&s;on to be <HI>afraid of evil
tidings; our hearts will be fixed tru&s;ting in
the Lord.</HI> When the religious fear of God
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es the heart, it expe$s the ignoble
fear of man; and becomes the principle of
courage and magnanimity. The Lord is
<HI>a buckler and a &s;hield</HI> to them that &s;erve
him. <HI>When he ari&s;eth, his enemies &s;hall be
&s;cattered, as &s;moke is driven away, and as
chaff before the wind. He giveth &s;trength

<P>THIS pa&s;&s;age of Scripture is under|&s;tood,<NOTE PLACE="marg">SERM. XV.</NOTE>
by all Chri&s;tian interpreters, to
refer to the days of the Go&s;pel. The Pro|phet
de&s;cribes, in the context, the au&s;pi|cious
influence of the Me&s;&s;iah's reign, as
<PB N="428" REF="435">
extending over all nature, and producing
univer&s;al felicity. The full accompli&s;h|ment
of this prediction is yet future, and
re&s;pects &s;ome more advanced period of the
kingdom of God, when true religion &s;hall
univer&s;ally prevail, and the native tendency
of the Go&s;pel attain its entire effect. In
the pro&s;pect of this event, the Prophet
&s;eems to ri&s;e above him&s;elf, and celebrates
that happy age in the mo&s;t &s;ublime &s;train
of ea&s;tern poetry. He opens a beautiful
view of the &s;tate of the world, as a &s;tate of
returning innocence. He repre&s;ents all
nature flouri&s;hing in peace; di&s;cord and
guile aboli&s;hed; the mo&s;t ho&s;tile natures
reconciled, and the mo&s;t &s;avage, reformed
and tamed. <HI>The wolf &s;hall dwell with the
lamb, and the leopard lie down with the
kid; and the calf, and the young lion, and the

and the &s;ucking child &s;hall play on the hole of

for the earth &s;hall be full of the knowledge of
the Lord, as the waters cover the &s;ea.</HI></P>
<P>Upon reading the&s;e words, we mu&s;t im|mediately
perceive the great encouragement
which they give to all good de&s;igns for pro|moting
religion in the world. When we
engage in the&s;e, we have the comfort of
being engaged, not only in a good cau&s;e,
but al&s;o in one that &s;hall undoubtedly be
&s;ucce&s;sful. For we are here a&s;&s;ured by the
divine promi&s;e, that truth and righteou&s;ne&s;s
&s;hall at length prevail, and that the in|crea&s;ing
influence of religion &s;hall introduce
general happine&s;s. It is a plea&s;ing and ani|mating
reflection, that in carrying on &s;uch
de&s;igns, we act upon the divine plan; and
co-operate with God for advancing the
kingdom of the Me&s;&s;iah. We have no rea|&s;on
to be di&s;couraged by any unfavourable
circum&s;tances which at pre&s;ent oppo&s;e our
pious endeavours. Though the ignorance,
&s;uper&s;tition, and corruption, which now fill
&s;o great a part of the world, have a dark
any my&s;terious a&s;pect, it is not beyond the
power of that Supreme Being who brings
<PB N="430" REF="437">
light out of darkne&s;s, to clear up tho&s;e per|plexing
appearances, and gradually to ex|tricate
mankind from the labyrinth of ig|norance
and errour. Let us con&s;ider how
improbable it &s;eemed, when the go&s;pel was
fir&s;t publi&s;hed, that it &s;hould extend &s;o far,
and overthrow &s;o much e&s;tabli&s;hed &s;uper&s;ti|tion,
as it has already done. There is no|thing,
in the pre&s;ent &s;tate of the world, to
render it more unlikely that it &s;hall one day
be univer&s;ally received, and prevail in its
full influence. At the ri&s;e of Chri&s;tianity,
the di&s;proportion was, at lea&s;t, as great,
between the apparent human cau&s;es, and
the effect which has actually been produced,
as there is, in our age, between the circum|&s;tances
of religion in the world, and the
effect which we farther expect. <HI>The Sun
of righteou&s;ne&s;s</HI> having already exerted its
influence in breaking through the thicke&s;t
darkne&s;s, we may ju&s;tly hope, that it is
powerful enough to di&s;pel all remaining
ob&s;curity; and that it will a&s;cend by de|grees
to that perfect day, when <HI>healing &s;hall
be under its wings</HI> to all the nations. <HI>A
<PB N="431" REF="438">
little one &s;hall become a thou&s;and; and a &s;mall
one, a &s;trong nation. I the Lord will ha&s;ten
it in its time</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">I&s;aiah lx. 22.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BESIDES the prediction which the text
contains of the future &s;ucce&s;s of religion,
it points out al&s;o a preci&s;e connection be|tween
the increa&s;e of religious knowledge,
and the happine&s;s of mankind. <HI>The know|ledge
of the Lord filling the earth,</HI> is a&s;&s;igned
as the cau&s;e why <HI>they &s;hall not hurt nor de|&s;troy
in all the holy mountain of God.</HI> To
this I am not to lead your thoughts; as
a &s;ubject both &s;uited to the occa&s;ion of the
pre&s;ent meeting, and proper to be illu&s;trated
in times, wherein total indifference to reli|gious
principles appears to gain ground.
Whether Chri&s;tianity &s;hall be propagated
farther or not, is treated as a matter of no
great concern to mankind. The opinion
prevails among many, that moral virtue
may &s;ub&s;i&s;t, with equal advantage, in|dependent
of religion. For moral princi|ples,
great regard is profe&s;&s;ed; but articles
<PB N="432" REF="439">
of religious belief are held to be ab&s;tract
tenets, remote from life; points of mer$
&s;peculation and debate, the influence of
which is very incon&s;iderable of the actions
of men. Their general conduct, it is con|tended,
will always proceed upon views
and principles which have more relation to
the pre&s;ent &s;tate of things; and religious
knowledge can therefore &s;tand in no nece&s;|&s;ary
conncetion with their happine&s;s and
pro&s;perity.&mdash;How adver&s;e &s;uch opinions
are both to the profe&s;&s;ion and practice of
religion, is abundantly evident. How ad|ver&s;e
they are to the general welfare and
real intere&s;ts of mankind, I hope to make
appear to candid minds.</P>
<P>By <HI>the knowledge of the Lord</HI> in the text,
is not to be under&s;tood the natural know|ledge
of God only. It is plain, that the
Prophet &s;peaks of the age of the Me&s;&s;iah,
when more enlarged di&s;coveries &s;hould be
made to mankind of the diving perfections
and government, than una&s;&s;i&s;ted rea&s;on
could attain. <HI>The knowledge of the Lord,</HI>
therefore, comprehends the principles of
<PB N="433" REF="440">
Chri&s;tianity, as well as of natural religion.
In order to di&s;cern the importance of &s;uch
knowledge to general happine&s;s, we &s;hall
con&s;ider man, I. as an individual; II. as a
member of &s;ociety.</P>
<P>I. CONSIDERING man as an individual,
let us inquire, how far the knowledge of
true religion is important, fir&s;t, to his im|provement;
next, to his con&s;olation.</P>
<P>FIRST, with re&s;pect to the improvement
of man; the advancement of his nature in
what is valuable and u&s;eful, the acqui&s;ition
of &s;uch di&s;po&s;itions and habits as fit him for
acting his part with propriety of this &s;tage,
and prepare him for a higher &s;tate of action
hereafter; what benefit does he receive, in
the&s;e re&s;pects, from religious knowledge and
belief? It is obvious, that all increa&s;e of
knowledge is improvement to the under|&s;tanding.
The more that its &s;phere is en|larged,
the greater number of objects that
are &s;ubmitted to its view, e&s;pecially when
the&s;e objects are of intrin&s;ic excellence, the
<PB N="434" REF="441">
more mu&s;t tho&s;e rational powers, which are
the glory of man, be in the cour&s;e of attain|ing
their proper &s;trength and maturity.
But were the knowledge of religion merely
&s;peculative, though the &s;peculation mu&s;t be
admitted to be noble, yet le&s;s could be &s;aid
of its importance. We recommend it to
mankind, as forming the heart, and direct|ing
the life. Tho&s;e pure and exalted con|ceptions
which the Chri&s;tian religion has
taught us to entertain of the Deity, as the
univer&s;al Father and righteous Governour
of the univer&s;e, the &s;tandard of un&s;potted
perfection, and <HI>the author of every good and
perfect gift;</HI> conducting his whole admini|&s;tration
with an eternal regard to order,
virtue, and truth; ever favouring the cau&s;e
and &s;upporting the intere&s;ts of righteous
men; and applying, in this direction, the
whole might of omnipotence, and the whole
coun&s;el of unerring wi&s;dom, from the be|ginning
to the end of things; &s;uch con|ceptions
both kindle devotion, and &s;trengthen
virtue. They give fortitude to the mind in
the practice of righteou&s;ne&s;s, and e&s;tabli&s;h
<PB N="435" REF="442">
the per&s;ua&s;ion of its being our highe&s;t in|tere&s;t.</P>
<P>All the doctrines peculiar to the Go&s;pel
are great improvements on what the light
of nature had imperfectly &s;ugge&s;ted. A
high di&s;pen&s;ation of Providence is made
known, particularly &s;uited to the exigencies
of man; calculated for recovering him from
that corrupted &s;tate into which experience
bears witne&s;s that he is fallen, and for re|&s;toring
him to integrity, and favour with his
Creator. The method of carrying on this
great plan is &s;uch as gives us the mo&s;t
&s;trinking views of the importance of righteou&s;|ne&s;s
or virtue, and of the high account in
which it &s;tands with God. The Son of
God appeared on the earth, and &s;uffered as
a propitiation for the &s;ins of the world,
with this expre&s;s intention, that he might
<HI>bring in everla&s;ting righteou&s;ne&s;s;</HI> that he
might <HI>purge our con&s;ciences from dead works
to &s;erve the living God;</HI> that he might <HI>re|deem
us from all iniquity, and purify unto
him&s;elf a peculiar people, zealous of good
works.</HI> Such a merciful interpo&s;ition of
<PB N="436" REF="443">
the Creator of the world, while it illu&s;|triou&s;ly
di&s;plays his goodne&s;s, and &s;ignalizes
his concern for the moral intere&s;ts of man|kind,
affords us, at the &s;ame time, the mo&s;t
&s;ati&s;fying ground of confidence and tru&s;t.
It offers an object to the mind, on which it
can lay hold for the &s;ecurity of its future
hopes; when, with a certainty far beyond
what any ab&s;tract argument could yield, it
appeals to a di&s;tingui&s;hed fact; and is
enabled to &s;ay, <HI>He that &s;pared not his own
Son, but delivered him up for us all, how
&s;hall be not with him al&s;o freely give us all
things</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Rom. viii. 32.</NOTE>?</P>
<P>While the divine Government is thus
placed in a light the mo&s;t amiable, and mo&s;t
encouraging to every virtuous mind, there
is, at the &s;ame time, &s;omething extremely
awful and &s;olemn in the whole doctrine of
redemption. It is calculated to &s;trike the
mind with reverence for the divine admi|ni&s;tration.
it points at &s;ome deep malignity
in &s;in, at &s;ome dreadful con&s;equences flow|ing
from guilt, unknown in their cau&s;es
<PB N="437" REF="444">
and in their whole effects to us, which
moved the Sovereign of the World to de|part
from the ordinary cour&s;e of Providence,
and to bring about the re&s;toration of his
fallen creatures by a method &s;o a&s;toni&s;hing.
Mankind are hereby awakened to the mo&s;t
&s;erious reflections. Such views are opened
of the &s;anctity of the divine laws, of the
&s;trictne&s;s of the divine ju&s;tice, of the im|portance
of the part which is a&s;&s;igned them
to act, as &s;erve to prevent their trifling with
human life, and add dignity and &s;olemnity
to virtue. The&s;e great purpo&s;es are farther
carried on, by the di&s;covery which is made
of the fixed connection in which this life
&s;tands with a future eternal &s;tate. We are
repre&s;ented as <HI>&s;owing now, what we are to
reap</HI> hereafter; undergoing a cour&s;e of pro|bation
and trial, which, according as it ter|minates
in our improvement, or leaves us
unreformed and corrupted, will di&s;mi&s;s us
to la&s;ting abodes, either of puni&s;hment or
reward. Such a di&s;covery ri&s;es far above
the dubious conjectures, and uncertain rea|&s;onings,
which mere natural light &s;ugge&s;ts
<PB N="438" REF="445">
concerning the future condition of man|kind.
Here we find, what alone can pro|duce
any con&s;iderable influence on practice,
explicit promi&s;e and threatening; an autho|ritative
&s;anction given to a law; the Gover|nour
and Judge revealed; and all the mo|tives
which can operate on hope and fear,
brought home to the heart, with <HI>Thus &s;aith
the Lord of Ho&s;ts.</HI> In a word, a great and
magnificent plan of divine admini&s;tration is
opened to us, in the Go&s;pel of Chri&s;t; and
nothing is omitted that can impre&s;s man|kind
with the per&s;ua&s;ion of their being all,
in the &s;tricte&s;t &s;en&s;e, &s;ubjects of the moral
government of God.</P>
<P>THOUGH the bounds of this Di&s;cour&s;e
allow us to take only an imperfect view of
the principles of Chri&s;tian doctrine, yet the
hints which have been given lay a &s;uffi|cient
foundation for appealing to every im|partial
mind, whether the knowledge and
belief of &s;uch principles be not intimately
connected with the improvement, and, by
con&s;equence, with the happine&s;s of man.
<PB N="439" REF="446">
I rea&s;on now with &s;uch as admit, that virtue
is the great &s;ource both of improvement
and happine&s;s. Let them lay what &s;tre&s;s
they plea&s;e upon the authority of con&s;cience,
and upon the force and evidence of its dic|tates;
can they refu&s;e to allow, that the
natural tendency of the principles which I
have mentioned, is to &s;upport tho&s;e dictates,
and to confirm that authority; to excite,
on various occa&s;ions, the mo&s;t u&s;eful &s;enti|ments;
to provide additional re&s;traints from
vice, and additional motives to every virtue?
Who dares pronounce, that there is no ca&s;e
in which con&s;cience, &s;tands in need of &s;uch
a&s;&s;i&s;tance, to direct, where there is &s;o much
uncertainty and darkne&s;s; and to prompt,
where there is &s;o much feeblene&s;s and irre|&s;olution,
and &s;uch a fatal pronene&s;s to vice
and folly?</P>
<P>But how good &s;oever the tendency of
religious principles may be, &s;ome will &s;till
call in que&s;tion their actual &s;ignificancy,
and influence on life. This tendency is
by various cau&s;es defeated. Between the
belief of religious principles and a corre|&s;pondent
<PB N="440" REF="447">
practice, it will be alleged that
frequent experience &s;hews there is no ne|ce&s;&s;ary
connection; and that therefore the
propagation of the one, cannot give us any
a&s;&s;urance of proportionable improvements
following in the other.&mdash;This, in part, is
granted to be true; as we admit that reli|gious
knowledge and belief are &s;u&s;ceptible
of various degrees, before they arrive at that
real chri&s;tian Faith which the Scripture re|pre&s;ents
as <HI>purifying the heart.</HI> But though
the connection between principle and prac|tice
be not nece&s;&s;ary and invariable, it will
not, I &s;uppo&s;e, be denied that there is &s;ome
connection. Here then one avenue to the
heart is opened. If the tendency of reli|gious
knowledge be good, wi&s;dom mu&s;t
direct, and duty oblige us to cultivate it.
For tendency will, atlea&s;t in &s;ome ca&s;es,
ri&s;e into effect and, probably, in more
ca&s;es than are known and ob&s;erved by the
world. Be&s;ides the di&s;tingui&s;hed examples
of true religion and virtue which have, more
or le&s;s, adorned every age of the Chri&s;tian
aera, what numbers may there be, in the
<PB N="441" REF="448">
more &s;ilent and private &s;cenes of life, over|looked
by &s;uperficial ob&s;ervers of mankind,
on who&s;e hearts and lives religious princi|ples
have the mo&s;t happy influence? Even
on loo&s;e and giddy minds, where they are
far from operating their full effect, their
influence is, frequently, not altogether lo&s;t.
Impre&s;&s;ions of religion often cheek vice in
its career. They prevent it from proceed|ing
its utmo&s;t length; and though they do
not entirely reform the offender, they &s;erve
to maintain order in &s;ociety. Per&s;ons who
are now bad, might probably have been
wor&s;e without them, and the world have
&s;uffered more from unre&s;trained licentiou&s;|ne&s;s.
They often &s;ow latent &s;eeds of good|ne&s;s
in the heart, which proper circum|&s;tances
and occa&s;ions afterwards ripen;
though the reformation of the offender may
not be &s;o con&s;picuous, as his former enor|mities
have been. From the native ten|dency
of religious belief, there is rea&s;on to
conclude, that tho&s;e good effects of it are
not &s;o rare as &s;ome would repre&s;ent them.
By its nature and tendency, we can better
<PB N="442" REF="449">
judge of its effects, than by ob&s;ervations
drawn from a &s;uppo&s;ed experience, which
often is narrow in its compa&s;s, and falla|cious
in its conclu&s;ions.</P>
<P>The actual influence of principle and be|lief
on mankind, admits of clear illu&s;tration
from unconte&s;ted matter of fact. They
who hold the good effects of Chri&s;tian prin|ciples
to be &s;o incon&s;iderable, as to render
the propagation of them of &s;mall import|ance,
will be at no lo&s;s to give us in&s;tances
of corrupt principles of belief having had
the mo&s;t powerful influence on the world.
Loud complaints we hear from this quarter,
of the direful effects which &s;uper&s;tition and
enthu&s;ia&s;m have produced; of their having
poi&s;oned the tempers, and transformed the
manners of men; of their having over|come
the &s;tronge&s;t re&s;traints of law, of rea|&s;on,
and humanity. Is this then the ca&s;e
that all principles, except good ones, are of
&s;uch mighty energy?&mdash;Strange! that fal&s;e
religion &s;hould be able to do &s;o much, and
true religion &s;o little; that belief, &s;o pow|erful
in the one ca&s;e, &s;hould be &s;o impo|tent
<PB N="443" REF="450">
in the other.&mdash;No impartial enquirer,
&s;urely, can entertain this opinion. The
whole hi&s;tory of mankind &s;hows that their
religious tenets and principles, of whatever
nature they be, are of great influence in
forming their character, and directing their
conduct. The mi&s;chief which fal&s;e prin|ciples
have done, affords a good argument
to guard carefully again&s;t errour; but as it
is a proof of what belief can do, it gives
ground to hope the more from it, when
rightly directed. The &s;ame torrent which,
when it is put out of its natural cour&s;e,
overflows and lays wa&s;te a country, adorns
and enriches it, when running in its pro|per
channel. If it be alleged that &s;uper|&s;tition
is likely to be more powerful in its
effects than truth, becau&s;e it agrees better
with the follies and corruptions of the
world, we may oppo&s;e to this on the other
hand, that truth has the divine ble&s;&s;ing and
the countenance of Heaven on its &s;ide.
Let us always hope well of a cau&s;e that is
good in it&s;elf, and beneficial to mankind.
Truth is mighty, and will prevail. Let us
<PB N="444" REF="451">
&s;pread the <HI>incorruptible &s;eed</HI> as widely as
we can, and tru&s;t in God that he will give
the increa&s;e. Having thus &s;hown the im|portance
of religious knowledge to man|kind
in the way of improvement, let us,</P>
<P>IN the &s;econd place, con&s;ider it in the
light of con&s;olation; as bringing aid and
relief to us amid&s;t the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of life.
Here religion inconte&s;tably triumphs; and
its happy effects in this re&s;pect, furni&s;h a
&s;trong argument to every benevolent mind
for wi&s;hing them to be farther diffu&s;ed
throughout the world. For without the
belief and hope afforded by divine Reve|lation,
the circum&s;tances of a man are ex|tremely
forlorn. He finds him&s;elf placed
here as a &s;tranger in a va&s;t univer&s;e, where
the powers and operations of nature are
very imperfectly known; where both the
beginnings and the i&s;&s;ues of things are in|volved
in my&s;terious darkne&s;s; where he
is unable to di&s;cover, with any certainty,
whence he &s;prung, or for what purpo&s;e he
was brought into this &s;tate of exi&s;tence;
<PB N="445" REF="452">
whether he be &s;ubjected to the government
of a mild, or of a wrathful ruler; what con|&s;truction
he is to put on many of the di&s;|pen&s;ations
of his providence; and what his
fate is to be when he departs hence. What
a di&s;con&s;olate &s;ituation, to a &s;erious enquir|ing
mind! The greater degree of virtue it
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es, its &s;en&s;ibility is likely to be the
more oppre&s;&s;ed by this burden of labouring
thought. Even though it were in one's
power to bani&s;h all unea&s;y thought, and to
fill up the hours of life with perpetual
amu&s;ement, life &s;o filled up would, upon
reflection, appear poor and trivial. But
the&s;e are far from being the terms upon
which man is brought into this world. He
is con&s;cious that his being is frail and fee|ble;
he &s;ees him&s;elf be&s;et with various
dangers; and is expo&s;ed to many a me|lancholy
apprehen&s;ion, from the evils
which he may have to encounter, before he
arrives at the clo&s;e of life. In this di&s;tre&s;&s;ed
condition, to reveal to him &s;uch di&s;coveries
of the Supreme Being as the Chri&s;tian reli|gion
affords, is to reveal to him a Father
<PB N="446" REF="453">
and a Friend; is to let in a ray of the mo&s;t
cheering light upon the darkne&s;s of the hu|man
e&s;tate. He who was before a de&s;ti|tute
orphan, wandering in the inho&s;pitable
de&s;ert, has now gained a &s;helter from the
bitter and inclement bla&s;t. He now knows
to whom to pray, and in whom to tru&s;t;
where to unbo&s;om his &s;orrows; and from
what hand to look for relief.</P>
<P>It is certain, that when the heart bleeds
from &s;ome wound of recent misfortune,
nothing is of equal efficacy with religious
comfort. It is of power to enlighten the
darke&s;t hour, and to a&s;&s;wage the &s;evere&s;t
woe, by the belief of divine favour, and
the pro&s;pect of a ble&s;&s;ed immortality. In
&s;uch hopes, the mind expatiates with joy;
and when bereaved of its earthly friends,
&s;olaces it&s;elf with the thoughts of one friend
who will never for&s;ake it. Re&s;ined rea|&s;onings
concerning the nature of the hu|man
condition, and the improvement which
philo&s;ophy teaches us to make of every
event, may entertain the mind when it is
at ea&s;e; may perhaps contribute to &s;ooth
<PB N="447" REF="454">
it, when &s;lightly touched with &s;orrow.
But when it is torn with any &s;ore di&s;tre&s;s,
they are cold and feeble, compared with a
direct promi&s;e from the word of God.
This is <HI>an anchor to the &s;oul both &s;ure and
&s;tedfa&s;t.</HI> This has given con&s;olation and
refuge to many a virtuous heart, at a time
when the mo&s;t cogent rea&s;onings would
have proved utterly unavailing.</P>
<P>Upon the approach of death, e&s;pecially,
when if man thinks at all, his anxiety
about his future intere&s;ts mu&s;t naturally in|crea&s;e,
the power of religious con&s;olation is
&s;en&s;ibly felt. Then appears, in the mo&s;t
&s;triking light, the high value of the di&s;co|veries
made by the Go&s;pel; not only life
and immortality revealed, but a mediator
with God di&s;covered; mercy proclaimed,
through him, to the frailties of the penitent
and the humble; and his pre&s;ence pro|mi&s;ed
to be with them when they are pa&s;&s;|ing
through <HI>the valley of the &s;hadow of
death,</HI> in order to bring them &s;afe into un|&s;een
habitations of re&s;t and joy. Here is
ground for their leaving the world with
<PB N="448" REF="455">
comfort and peace. But in this &s;evere and
trying period, this labouring hour of na|ture,
how &s;hall the unhappy man &s;upport
him&s;elf, who knows not, or believes not,
the hope of religion? Secretly con&s;cious
to him&s;elf that he has not acted his part as
he ought to have done, the &s;ins of his pa&s;t
life ari&s;e before him in &s;ad remembrance.
He wi&s;hes to exi&s;t after death, and yet
dreads that exi&s;tence. The Governour of
the world is unknown. He cannot tell
whether every endeavour to obtain his
mercy may not be in vain. All is awful
ob&s;curity around him; and in the mid&s;t of
endle&s;s doubts and perplexities, the trem|bling,
reluctant &s;oul, is forced away from
the body. As the mis&s;ortunes of life mu&s;t,
to &s;uch a man, have been mo&s;t oppre&s;&s;ive,
&s;o its end is bitter. His &s;un &s;ets in a dark
cloud; and the night of death clo&s;es over
his head, full of mi&s;ery.&mdash;Having now
&s;hewn how important <HI>the knowldege of the
Lord</HI> is, both to the improvement and the
con&s;olation of man, con&s;idered as an indi|vidual,
I am next to &s;hew,</P>
<P><PB N="449" REF="456">
II. How important this knowledge is to
him as a member of &s;ociety. This branch
of the &s;ubject is in part anticipated by what
has been &s;aid. For all the improvement
which man receives as an individual, re|dounds
to the benefit of the public. Society
reaps the fruit of the virtues of all the
members who compo&s;e it; and in propor|tion
as each, apart, is made better, the
whole mu&s;t flouri&s;h.</P>
<P>But be&s;ides this effect, religious know|ledge
has a direct tendency to improve the
&s;ocial intercour&s;e of men, and to a&s;&s;i&s;t them
in co-operating for common good. It is
the great in&s;trument of civilizing the mul|titude,
and forming them to union. It
tames the fiercene&s;s of their pa&s;&s;ions, and
&s;oftens the rudene&s;s of their manners.
There is much rea&s;on to doubt whether
any regular &s;ociety ever &s;ub&s;i&s;ted, or could
&s;ub&s;i&s;t, in the world, de&s;titute of all reli|gious
ideas and principles. They who, in
early times, attempted to bring the wander|ing
and &s;cattered tribes of men from the
woods, and to unite them in cities and
<PB N="450" REF="457">
communities, always found it nece&s;&s;ary to
begin with &s;ome in&s;titution of religion.
The wi&s;e&s;t legi&s;lators of old, through the
whole progre&s;s of their &s;y&s;tems of govern|ment,
con&s;idered religion as effential to civil
polity. If even tho&s;e imperfect forms of
it, loaded with &s;o much &s;uper&s;tition and
errour, were important to the welfare of
&s;ociety, how much more that rea&s;onable
wor&s;hip of the true God, which is taught
by the Go&s;pel? True religion introduces
the idea of regular &s;ubjection, by accu&s;|toming
mankind to the awe of &s;uperiour
power in the Deity, joined with the vene|ration
of &s;uperiour wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s.
It is by its nature an a&s;&s;ociating principle;
and creates new and &s;acred bonds of union
among men. Common a&s;&s;emblies for reli|gious
wor&s;hip, and joint homage offered
up to one God; the &s;en&s;e of being all de|pendent
on the &s;ame protection, and bound
to duty by the &s;ame ties, &s;harers in the
&s;ame benefits of heaven, and expectants of
the &s;ame reward, tend to awaken the &s;en|timents
of friendly relation, and to con|firm
<PB N="451" REF="458">
firm and &s;trengthen our mutual connexion.
The doctrine of Chri&s;tianity is mo&s;t adver&s;e
to all tyranny and oppre&s;&s;ion, but highly
favourable to the intere&s;ts of good govern|ment
among men. It repre&s;&s;es the &s;pirit
of licentiou&s;ne&s;s and &s;edition. It inculcates
the duty of &s;ubordination to lawful &s;upe|riours.
It requires us <HI>to fear God, to ho|nour
the king, and not to meddle with them
that are given to change.</HI></P>
<P>Religious knowledge forwards all u&s;eful
and ornamental improvements in &s;ociety.
Experience &s;hows, that in proportion as it
diffu&s;es its light, learning flouri&s;hes, and
liberal arts are cultivated and advanced.
Ju&s;t conceptions of religion promote a free
and manly &s;pirit. They lead men to think
for them&s;elves; to form their principles
upon fair inquiry, and not to re&s;ign their
con&s;cience to the dictates of men. Hence
they naturally in&s;pire aver&s;ion to &s;lavery of
every kind; and promote a ta&s;te for liberty
and laws. De&s;potic governments have ge|nerally
taken the firme&s;t root among nations
that were blinded by Mahometan or Pagan
<PB N="452" REF="459">
darkne&s;s; where the throne of violence has
been &s;upported by ignorance and &s;al&s;e reli|gion.
In the Chri&s;tian world, during tho&s;e
centuries in which gor&s;s &s;uper&s;tition held its
reign undi&s;turbed, oppre&s;&s;ion and &s;lavery
were in its train. The cloud of ignorance
&s;at thick and deep over the nations; and
the world was threatened with a relap&s;e into
ancient harbarity. As &s;oon as the true
<HI>knowledge of the Lord</HI> revived, at the au&s;pi|cious
aera of the Reformation, learning, li|berty,
and arts, began to &s;hine forth with it,
and to re&s;ume their lu&s;tre.</P>
<P>But the happy influence which religion
exerts on &s;ociety, extends much farther than
to effects of this kind. It is not only &s;ub|&s;idiary
to the improvement, but nece&s;&s;ary to
the pre&s;ervation of &s;ociety. It is the very
ba&s;is on which it re&s;ts. Religious prin|ciple
is what gives men the &s;ure&s;t hold of
one another. That la&s;t and greate&s;t pledge
of veracity, an oath, without which no &s;o|ciety
could &s;ub&s;i&s;t, derives its whole autho|rity
from an e&s;tabli&s;hed reverence of God,
to whom it is a &s;olemn appeal. Bani&s;h re|ligious
<PB N="453" REF="460">
principle, and you loo&s;en all the
bonds which connect mankind together;
you &s;hake the fundamental pillar of mutual
confidence and tru&s;t; you render the &s;ecu|rity
ari&s;ing from laws, in a great mea&s;ure,
void and ineffectual. For human laws, and
human &s;anctions, cannot extend to number|le&s;s
ca&s;es, in which the &s;afety of mankind
is deeply concerned. They would prove
very feeble in&s;truments of order and peace,
if there were no cheeks upon the conduct of
men from the &s;en&s;e of divine legi&s;lation; if
no belief of future rewards and puni&s;hments
were to overawe con&s;cience, and to &s;upply
the defects of human government.</P>
<P>Indeed, the belief of religion is of &s;uch
importance to public welfare, that the mo&s;t
expre&s;&s;ive de&s;cription we could give of a
&s;ociety of men in the utmo&s;t di&s;order, would
be to &s;ay, that there was no fear of God
left among them. Imagination would im|mediately
conceive of them as abandoned to
rapine and violence, to per&s;idy and treachery;
as deceiving and deceived, oppre&s;&s;ing and
oppre&s;&s;ed; con&s;umed by inte&s;tine broils,
<PB N="454" REF="461">
and ripe for becoming a prey to the fir&s;t
invader. On the other hand, in order to
form the idea of a &s;ociety flouri&s;hing in its
highe&s;t glory, we need only conceive the
belief of Chri&s;tian principles exerting its full
influence on the hearts and lives of all the
members. In&s;tantly, the mo&s;t amiable &s;cene
would open to our view. We &s;hould &s;ee
the cau&s;es of public di&s;union removed, when
men were animated with that noble &s;pirit of
love and charity which our religion breathes;
and formed to the pur&s;uit of tho&s;e higher
intere&s;ts, which give no occa&s;ion to compe|tition
and jealou&s;y. We &s;hould &s;ee families,
neighbourhoods, and communities, living in
unbroken amity, and pur&s;uing, with one
heart and mind, the common intere&s;t; &s;o|briety
of manners, and &s;implicity of life,
re&s;tored; virtuous indu&s;try carrying on its
u&s;eful labours, and cheerful contentment
every where reigning. Politicians may lay
down what plans they plea&s;e for advancing
public pro&s;perity; but, in truth, it is the
prevalency of &s;uch principles of religion and
virtue, which forms the &s;trength and glory
<PB N="455" REF="462">
of a nation. When the&s;e are totally want|ing,
no mea&s;ures contrived by human wi&s;|dom
can &s;upply the defect. In proportion
as they prevail, they rai&s;e the &s;tate of &s;ociety
from that &s;ad degeneracy into which it is at
pre&s;ent &s;unk; and carry it forward, under
the ble&s;&s;ing of Heaven, towards that happy
period, when <HI>nation &s;hall not lift up their
&s;word again&s;t nation, nor learn war any
more.</HI></P>
<P>In order to prove the importance of reli|gious
knowledge to the intere&s;t of &s;ociety,
one con&s;ideration more, de&s;erving particu|lar
attention, remains to be mentioned. It
is, that if <HI>good &s;eed</HI> be not &s;own in the field,
<HI>tares</HI> will infallibly &s;pring up. The pro|pen&s;ion
towards religion is &s;trong in the
human heart. There is a natural prepa|ration
in our minds, for receiving &s;ome im|pre&s;&s;ions
of &s;upernatural belief. Upon
the&s;e, among ignorant and uncultivated
men, &s;uper&s;tition or enthu&s;ia&s;m never fail
to graft them&s;elves. Into what mon&s;trous
forms the&s;e have &s;hot forth, and what va|rious
mi&s;chiefs they have produced to &s;o|ciety
<PB N="456" REF="463">
is too well known. Nor is this the
whole of the danger. De&s;igning men are
always ready to take advantage of this po|pular
weakne&s;s, and to direct the &s;uper&s;ti|tious
bias of the multitude to their own am|bitious
and intere&s;ted ends. Super&s;tition,
in it&s;elf a formidable evil, threatens con&s;e|quences
&s;till more formidable, when it is
rendered the tool of de&s;ign and craft. Hence
ari&s;es one of the mo&s;t powerful arguments
for propagating with zeal, as far as our in|fluence
can extend, the pure and unde&s;iled
doctrines of the Go&s;pel of Chri&s;t; in order
that ju&s;t and rational principles of religion
may fill up that room in the minds of men,
which dangerous fanatici&s;m will otherwi&s;e
u&s;urp.</P>
<P>This con&s;ideration alone is &s;ufficient to
&s;how the high utility of the de&s;ign under|taken
by the Society for propagating Chri&s;|tian
Knowledge. With great propriety,
they have be&s;towed their chief attention on
a remote quarter of our own country, where,
from a variety of cau&s;es, ignorance and &s;u|per&s;tition
had gained more ground, than in
<PB N="457" REF="464">
any other corner of the land; where the
inhabitants, by their local &s;ituation, were
more imperfectly &s;upplied with the means
of proper education and in&s;truction; and at
the &s;ame time expo&s;ed to the &s;eductions of
&s;uch as &s;ought to pervert them from the
truth. The laudable endeavours of the
Society in diffu&s;ing religious and u&s;eful
knowledge through this part of the country,
have already been crowned with much &s;uc|ce&s;s;
and more is &s;till to be expected from
the continuance of their pious and well-directed
attention.</P>
<P>With &s;uch good de&s;igns, it becomes all
to co-operate, who are lovers of mankind.
Thus &s;hall they &s;how their ju&s;t &s;en&s;e of the
value of that ble&s;&s;ing which they enjoy, in
the knowledge of the Go&s;pel of Chri&s;t;
and their gratitude to Heavan for confer|ring
it upon them. Thus &s;hall they make
the ble&s;&s;ings of tho&s;e who are now ready
to <HI>peri&s;h through lack of knowledge,</HI> de&s;cend
upon their heads. Thus &s;hall they contri|bute
their endeavours for bringing forward
that happy period foretold by ancient pro|phecy;
<PB N="458" REF="465">
when <HI>there &s;hall be one Lord over
