<HEAD>THE Secret Hi&s;tory OF THE <HI>White-Staff.</HI></HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">PART II.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING, in the Clo&s;e of the fir&s;t Volume of this Hi&s;tory, given the Readers &s;ome Ground to expect, the latter Part of the Account &s;hould, in proce&s;s of Time, be publi&s;h'd, in order to per|fect the <HI>Secret Hi&s;tory</HI> of the Manage|ment of Affairs, and of the Conduct of &s;ome late Mini&s;ters; and finding the general Satisfaction which the fir&s;t Part
<PB N="4" REF="3">
of this Work has given, Ju&s;tice re|quires that I &s;hould go on to fini&s;h the &s;ame.</P>
<P>Yet I cannot be &s;aid to go on where I left off, but it will be needful to give a brief Recapitulation of a Circum|&s;tance or two, which is but hinted lightly at in the fir&s;t Part, in order to pre&s;erve the Connection of the Hi|&s;torical Relation of things, and, with the greater Clearne&s;s, to introduce the Matters which are behind.</P>
<P>In order to this, the Reader may plea&s;e to recollect, that in <HI>Page</HI> the 19<HI>th</HI> of the former Part of this Hi&s;tory, the&s;e Words are to be found; <Q>&startq;&endq;We are to note, that when the Victory of the <HI>White-Staff</HI> was, to outward Appearance, compleat, and the di&s;|plac'd Party &s;eem'd, even by their own Confe&s;&s;ion, to have nothing left to do but to de&s;pair; then was the real Conflict greater than ever, and he had a greater Difficulty to withhold the Rage of tho&s;e who were for u&s;ing their Advantages with Rigour, and entirely cru&s;hing, ru|ining, and oppre&s;&s;ing tho&s;e whom he had reduced, than he had had before either to reduce them, or to pre&s;erve him&s;elf.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="4">
<Q>&startq;&endq;The <HI>Staff</HI> had hitherto proceeded with a &s;teady Re&s;olution to maintain the Authority and Power he po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ed, and had, as before, &s;ucce&s;sfully fru&s;trated and di&s;appointed all the Mea&s;ures of tho&s;e who would have overthrown and pulled him down: But it was apparent, that Victory being obtained, he had no farther Schemes of Oppo&s;ition to pur&s;ue; that it was not in his De&s;ign to cru&s;h and ruine the Per&s;ons he &s;truggled with, or to erect any Dominion o|ver them as <HI>Britains;</HI> that he had no State Tyranny to erect, no &s;ecret De&s;igns to betray the Con&s;titution, and this Negative introduced a War between him and tho&s;e, who, to out|ward Appearance, were in the &s;ame Intere&s;t with him, which at la&s;t broke out into a Flame, which produced un|looked for Events, which will be part of the Subject of the re&s;t of this Hi&s;tory.</Q></P>
<P>It need not be added here, for Explanation of things, that the Mini&s;try of the late Queen's Maje&s;ty, upon every Occa&s;ion, as they found needful, had Re|cour&s;e to that old Maxim of Politicks, That <HI>Men might be made u&s;e of when they can &s;erve us, without any real De&s;ign to &s;erve</HI>
<PB N="6" REF="5">
<HI>them.</HI> In a Nation guided by Parties, as this has too long, too often, and too much been, this Maxim becomes more than ordinarily nece&s;&s;ary; but in the Ca&s;e of the <HI>Staff,</HI> this was more parti|cularly &s;o here al&s;o, than at any Time in the Years &s;ince the Revolution.</P>
<P>A little Retro&s;pection upon the Hi|&s;tory of the Times, would give us fre|quent Examples of this Maxim, and of its being, with great Ju&s;tice and Since|rity, put in Execution; as in the late inte&s;tine Broils of this Nation, when King <HI>Charles</HI> I. arm'd and employ'd the Papi&s;ts again&s;t his Prote&s;tant, but male|content, or rebellious Subjects, yet had him&s;elf no Inclination to <HI>Popery;</HI> nor was it any thing more or le&s;s than this, that the King, being pre&s;s'd by the vi|ctorious Arms of the Parliament Forces, accepted of the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of his Popi&s;h Subjects: There is no Que&s;tion but the Papi&s;ts had De&s;igns in their View, for the Intere&s;t and Advancement of their Party, and perhaps of their Religion too, in all they did; but as a Man drowning, accepts of the Help of the wor&s;t Enemy he has, to pull him out of the Water, it is not to be expected he &s;hould ask him what Religion he
<PB N="7" REF="6">
is of, or whether he has not &s;ome ill De&s;ign upon him in &s;aving his Life. King <HI>Charles</HI> II. in Pur&s;uit of the &s;ame natural Principle, gladly accepted of the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of a <HI>Presbyterian</HI> Army, and &s;ubmitted to take the Solemn and National League and Covenant in <HI>Scot|land,</HI> in order to rein&s;tate him in his Dominions; and afterwards made u&s;e of a <HI>Presbyterian</HI> General and Army for his Re&s;toration; yet was there very little Cau&s;e to &s;u&s;pect that Monarch of inclining to turn <HI>Presbyterian,</HI> or of fa|vouring the <HI>Presbyterian</HI> Intere&s;t in his Heart.</P>
<P>I might de&s;cend to the particular Time I am writing about, when, upon a former Difference between the old and modern <HI>Whigs,</HI> the former, <HI>if Fame lies not,</HI> &s;crupled not to accept the Coalition of the <HI>Jacobite</HI> Intere&s;t, in order to overthrow the latter, and pu&s;h them out of the Admini&s;tration; a Truth &s;o well known to his Grace the D. of <HI>M&mdash;h,</HI> and &s;o recent in his Memory, as that he neither can be ig|norant of the Fact, or forget the Cir|cum&s;tances which went &s;o nigh, and bid &s;o fair to have &s;upplanted him in the Favour of his Royal Mi&s;tre&s;s, and to
<PB N="8" REF="7">
have di&s;mi&s;s'd him from the Service of his Country by his Friends, at lea&s;t a Year before it was effected by his Enemies.</P>
<P>I have many Tracts written about the Years 1708-9-10, to prove this; and a long Recapitulation thereof is found in an anonymous Pamphlet of that Time, which, on that very Ac|count, made much Noi&s;e, entituled, <HI>The October Club,</HI> written, as was &s;aid, by the late Sir <HI>G. H</HI>&mdash;</P>
<P>If the Author of <HI>The Memoirs of Scot|land</HI> &s;ays true, the Example reaches thither; for in the Hi&s;tory of the late Inva&s;ion there, &s;peaking of the Peoples Aver&s;ion to the Union, he has the&s;e Words: <HI>Nay, the</HI> Presbyterians <HI>and</HI> Ca|meronians <HI>were willing to pa&s;s over the Objection of his</HI> (the Pretender) <HI>being a Papi&s;t, pag.</HI> 343. and yet this Author does not &s;uppo&s;e thereby, that the <HI>Pre&s;|byterians</HI> and <HI>Cameronians</HI> were really Friends to the <HI>Jacobite</HI> Intere&s;t; but that &s;uch was their Aver&s;ion and Abo|mination of the Union, that they would join with their Enemies &s;o far as might a&s;&s;i&s;t them to overthrow the main Evil, and pre&s;erve them&s;elves from the capi|tal Grievance of the Union.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="8">
The&s;e Examples would be &s;ufficient to prove the Inju&s;tice of that Calumny rai&s;ed on the <HI>White Staff, viz.</HI> that he was in the Intere&s;t of the Pretender, becau&s;e he made u&s;e of the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of <HI>Jacobite</HI> In&s;truments, in the nece&s;&s;ary Oppo&s;ition which he was oblig'd to make to the Party who &s;et up again&s;t him; but the Complaints of the <HI>Jaco|bites</HI> them&s;elves, and the Length they went afterwards, when they found them&s;elves di&s;appointed, are &s;tronger Evidences upon the Point I am upon, than any thing el&s;e that can be offered amount even to a Demon&s;tration, that the De&s;igns of the <HI>Staff</HI> were all along &s;o remote from a <HI>Jacobite</HI> Intere&s;t, that nothing le&s;s than the effectual Ruine of their whole Party, would have been the Con&s;equence of the Mea&s;ures the la&s;t was engaged in.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be granted, that the <HI>Jacobites</HI> had very ju&s;t Cau&s;e to re&s;ent the Con|duct of the <HI>Staff,</HI> and that they were dup'd and bubbled in the Beginning of the&s;e Mea&s;ures, in the gro&s;&s;e&s;t and mo&s;t obvious Manner; but as they had much more Rea&s;on to blame their own Credulity, than any other Cau&s;e; &s;o neither can they charge the <HI>Staff</HI>
<PB N="10" REF="9">
with any Breach of Articles with, or promi&s;es to them, he having never en|tered into the lea&s;t Engagement with them; but they being led by the Sci|tuation of their own Affairs, to em|brace every Cloud, and follow the <HI>Igni fatui</HI> of their Imaginations, they fell in with the fir&s;t Notion of a Court Revolution upon this Foundation, <HI>viz.</HI> that every publick Divi&s;ion was to their Advantage; that their Circum&s;tances might be better, but could not be wor&s;e; that whatever tended to it was their Bu&s;ine&s;s to &s;erve Voluntier with any, and with every Party that would entertain them.</P>
<P>Upon this Foot, they came in and join'd with the <HI>Staff,</HI> as they had be|fore come in with the <HI>Whigs</HI> again&s;t the antient <HI>Staff,</HI> who went before him.</P>
<P>So that the <HI>Jacobites</HI> coming in with the <HI>Staff,</HI> was the Con&s;equence of the Nature of their Circum&s;tances at that Time, as the <HI>Staff</HI> receiving them, and making u&s;e of them, was the Con&s;e|quence of his; that there was never any Concert between them, either of Affection to their Intere&s;t or Party as <HI>Jacobites,</HI> appears to me very evident, by the Te&s;timony and Conduct of the
<PB N="11" REF="10">
<HI>Jacobites</HI> them&s;elves, which belongs to this part of our Hi&s;tory to relate.</P>
<P>If this Di&s;cour&s;e &s;hould a little di&s;cri|minate the Per&s;ons who really were, as well as tho&s;e who <HI>were not,</HI> in the <HI>Jacobite</HI> Intere&s;t among the late Admi|ni&s;trators; as it mu&s;t be placed to the Account of their own Conduct, it is hoped they will pardon the Hi&s;torian, who&s;e Bu&s;ine&s;s is Truth, and who de|&s;igns no other Satyrs on the Gentlemen, than the relating of their own Con|duct makes natural to the Story.</P>
<P>When the <HI>Jacobites</HI> found their Way into the publick Admini&s;tration, <HI>for no one denies but that &s;ome might do &s;o,</HI> they had no more Patience or Power to conceal their Intentions and Re&s;olutions to im|prove that Advantage for the Service of the Pretender, than they had to conceal their Joy at that Advantage.</P>
<P>Now although this abundantly ex|po&s;ed their Weakne&s;s, and want of Po|licy in the Management of their Par|ty; yet it al&s;o convinc'd the Mini&s;try, that they had &s;ome Nece&s;&s;ity to keep up the Vanity, and to give them (the <HI>Jacobites)</HI> all the &s;eeming Encourage|ment to hope for the End they aimed
<PB N="12" REF="11">
at, that could come from it, with doing nothing el&s;e really for them,</P>
<P>That which was mo&s;t wonderful in all this Part was, that the whole Body of the <HI>Jacobites</HI> in <HI>Britain</HI> were capable of being impos'd upon to &s;uch a De|gree; and that it was po&s;&s;ible the <HI>STAFF</HI> could u&s;e them as Tools to &s;uch a Length, and not take one real Step in their Favour, as it is certain he never did; and yet they &s;hould be &s;o &s;tupid, as that to the la&s;t four Months, or thereabouts, to believe him in their Intere&s;t.</P>
<P><HI>It was the con&s;tant Expre&s;&s;ion of a late Noble Lord among the</HI> Jacobites, <HI>who had more Penetration of this kind than his &s;aid whole Party, and who frequently expre&s;s'd his Re&s;entment with more Warmth than ordinary;</HI> God d&mdash;n him! <HI>&s;aid his Lord&s;hip,</HI> what has he ever done for us? Has he not fed us with good Words and fine Notions all along; told us, it was not a Time to enter upon the Que&s;tion; and that to mention any thing of the <HI>Pretender,</HI> would alarm the Nation, and break all the publick Mea|&s;ures? Has he done any thing but made Fools of us? I am &s;atisfied he is a Spy upon us for the Hou&s;e of <HI>Hanover;</HI>
<PB N="13" REF="12">
he is no more for the Pretender, than he is for the <HI>Grand Seignior,</HI> by G&mdash;d.</P>
<P>But the Party would not believe it, and the <HI>Staff</HI> had &s;uch an A&s;cendant over them, whether by Money or other Management, that they did all his Work, came into all his Mea&s;ures, and became the mo&s;t ob&s;equious Wretches in ruining their own Cau&s;e, that any Mini&s;ter of State could po&s;&s;ibly de&s;ire; never Men were brought in to act &s;o directly contrary to the Intere&s;t they profe&s;s'd to own; never Men were &s;o hand&s;omely trepann'd by their own Stupidity, or &s;o nicely made Tools to cut the Throat of their own Mea|&s;ures, as the <HI>Jacobites</HI> were, by the Po|licy and Management of the <HI>Staff;</HI> and yet had the Folly or Misfortune to believe to the la&s;t, or within a little of it, that their <HI>PAM</HI> was <HI>Trump,</HI> and that the Game of the Pretender wos going on.</P>
<P>This Stupidity of the <HI>Jacobites,</HI> gave them up entirely into the Captivity of the <HI>STAFF;</HI> and there was nothing &s;o fooli&s;h, &s;o ridiculous, or &s;o e&s;&s;ential to the De&s;truction of the Pretender's Intere&s;t, which they were not ca|pable
<PB N="14" REF="13">
of coming into, with a real Opi|nion or Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, <HI>it can be called no le&s;s,</HI> that they were all the while taking the be&s;t Mea&s;ures in the World to bring him to the Throne; they might as well have &s;aid, to the <HI>Gallows.</HI></P>
<P>It is true, that this Confidence of theirs gave an invincible Argument to tho&s;e People, who alarm'd the whole Nation with the Apprehen&s;ions of the Pretender's coming; and, had the <HI>Ja|cobites</HI> been allow'd to exerci&s;e common Service, the Argument for the Danger of the Pretender had been unan&s;wer|able; but this requires to be &s;poke to by it &s;elf.</P>
<P>I return to the Conduct of the <HI>Ja|cobites,</HI> and have eminently prov'd, they have been dup'd in all this Affair, in which either the <HI>WHITE STAFF</HI> &s;hew'd the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite piece of Ma|nagement, that has been acted by any Mini&s;ter of State in this or the la&s;t Age, or the whole <HI>Jacobite</HI> Party mu&s;t be allowed to be the ea&s;ie&s;t People, and the mo&s;t ea&s;y to be bubbled, that ever pretended to be call'd a Party: The Story is as follows.</P>
<P>There was in that Part of <HI>Britain,</HI> which is famous for having the fewe&s;t
<PB N="15" REF="14">
Fools, and the mo&s;t&mdash;a Sett of leading Men, who&s;e Intere&s;t among their Tenants and Dependants was far from being contemptible, and who, being avowedly and profe&s;&s;edly in the <HI>Jacobite</HI> Intere&s;t, were therefore count|ed dangerous Per&s;ons, very many ways, to the Repo&s;e of the Nation; they were look'd upon as a People, who, upon Occa&s;ion, were able to make the Government very unea&s;y, and who, there was Rea&s;on to believe, wanted nothing but the Occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Mea&s;ures taken with the&s;e Men were, if po&s;&s;ible, to get them &s;ent up by their Country to the Parliament; Nothing pleas'd them in the World like it; the <HI>Whigs</HI> re&s;ented it in the highe&s;t Degree; the <HI>Staff</HI> was reproach|ed with fixing a Li&s;t, not only pitch|ing upon &s;ome of the meane&s;t of the Nobility to repre&s;ent the re&s;t; but di|&s;tingui&s;hing the profe&s;s'd Enemies of the Prote&s;tant Succe&s;&s;ion to &s;erve in Parliament, where the farther Security of that Succe&s;&s;ion was to be one of the great Works they were to do.</P>
<P>Under this Reproach however, the Per&s;ons were nam'd, and &s;ent up, and the <HI>Jacobites</HI> in that part of the Nation,
<PB N="16" REF="15">
di&s;covered not only their Wickedne&s;s in de&s;iring, but their egregious Folly in expecting, that &s;ending up &s;o piti|ful a Fragment of the Heads of their Faction, &s;hould &s;et their Cau&s;e on Foot, even in the Parliament it &s;elf; no En|thu&s;ia&s;tick Calculator of Times was ever then &s;o big with his Lines and Numbers, and his having &s;et the Day for the general Conflagration, as the&s;e blinded Creatures appeared with the Opinion, that the Pretender was to be introduced by the Voice of the Legi|&s;lature; and that Her Maje&s;ty al&s;o to demit in his Favour; and all this, be|cau&s;e their Li&s;t was in the Number; and that 3 or 4 at mo&s;t of tho&s;e, who they called <HI>Patriots,</HI> were to &s;it in the Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>When it was told the <HI>STAFF</HI> what Offence this gave on one Side, and what ga&s;conading the <HI>Jacobites</HI> made on the other, all he was heard to &s;ay upon that Head was, <HI>Let them come up.</HI></P>
<P>They mu&s;t be very weak &s;ighted, who could not gather by that An&s;wer, what the true De&s;ign of the <HI>Staff</HI> was in obtaining that Li&s;t; and it was but a few Days after they came up, but
<PB N="17" REF="16">
they &s;aw it them&s;elves; and one of them, now Defunct, openly &s;wore, they were bubbl'd; and that if he had &s;een the De&s;ign, he would never have come out of his own Country.</P>
<P>I remember very well, in a Confe|rence between two Per&s;ons of the fir&s;t Rank, this Matter was mentioned, and one of the noble Per&s;ons expre&s;|&s;ing him&s;elf with &s;ome Warmth at the impo&s;ing, <HI>as he was pleas'd to call it,</HI> on the Nation &s;o much, as to bring up &s;uch Per&s;ons to Parliament; the o|ther coolly ask'd this Que&s;tion, Are they Men dangerous for the Intere&s;t they have in their Country? yes, my Lord, &s;ays the other, very dange|rous, and the Pretender values him&s;elf very much upon their Intere&s;t there; then replies the &s;econd, Pray, my Lord, can they do lea&s;t Harm here or there? His Lord&s;hip pau&s;ed a while, Are you &s;incere in that, my Lord, &s;ays the fir&s;t Per&s;on? In Faith I did not &s;ee into it; I prote&s;t it is the be&s;t Step my Lord T&mdash;ever took of the kind; I will never &s;ay a Word more again&s;t it.</P>
<P>It was but a very few Days 'ere, as I &s;aid above, the Per&s;ons them&s;elves
<PB N="18" REF="17">
&s;aw this too on the Occa&s;ion following. The P&mdash;t a&s;&s;embl'd, and the fir&s;t thing done, as is frequent in like Ca&s;es, was an Addre&s;s from the Peers to thank Her Maje&s;ty for Her gracious A&s;&s;urance of Her Royal Favour, and Her Concern for the publick Good, expre&s;s'd in Her Speech to both Hou&s;es from the Throne; making a mo&s;t du|tiful Return of their Zeal and Af|fection for Her Maje&s;ty's Per&s;on and Government; and a Tender of their utmo&s;t Services for Defence of Her Maje&s;ty's ju&s;t Title to the Crown, and &s;tanding by Her, and adhering &s;teadily to Her Intere&s;t again&s;t all Pretenders what&s;oever, and again&s;t Her Enemies both at home and abroad.</P>
<P>If the&s;e <HI>Jacobite</HI> P&mdash;s, who had the Folly to dream of other Bu&s;ine&s;s to be done that Se&s;&s;ion, were unea&s;y at the fir&s;t Motion of this Addre&s;s, they were thunder-&s;truck and confounded when they &s;aw them&s;elves &s;ingled out and named of the Committee to draw up the Addre&s;s; then it was that they cur&s;t their own Stupidity, and parti|cularly the Per&s;on mention'd before &s;hew'd his Pa&s;&s;ion in a Manner not ea&s;ily to be expre&s;s'd, when meeting
<PB N="19" REF="18">
my Lord&mdash;who was a Partner in his Di&s;appointment, that very Day that the Addre&s;s was drawn up, he gave &s;ome Vent to his Di&s;tur|bance in very warm Expre&s;&s;ions; he told him, That it was an Affront to their Nation, that they &s;hould be cho&s;en out to do a Work again&s;t their Allegeance; that now he plainly &s;aw they had been abu&s;ed; that he would never have &s;tirred out of his Country, if he had thought this had been the Bu&s;ine&s;s of their being &s;ent up to Par|liament; that they were bubbl'd and dup'd in the highe&s;t Degree, and that it was not to be born; then he flew out again&s;t the <HI>White Staff,</HI> as the Per|&s;on that had drawn him into this Snare; and that he had been flatter'd with the fine Story of &s;erving his Country and Family; by which he under&s;tood the promoting the Intere&s;t of the Royal Family, and of K&mdash;<HI>J</HI>&mdash;VIII. &s;o he call'd him, the Pretender: And now he not only found that he was deluded in the main Expectation; but that the <HI>Staff</HI> him|&s;elf had &s;ingled him out, to put his Hand to the making that cur&s;ed Ad|dre&s;s, which had ruined him with his
<PB N="20" REF="19">
Friends, and ruined his Intere&s;t with the Pretender for ever; that he was trick'd every Way in it; for that if he had &s;tay'd at Home, he would have gone to the Hills, and had a fair Day for it; but here was nothing to be done; to refu&s;e, would be to go to the Tower; and to comply, was to betray his King, &amp;c. He told him, he had &s;poken to the <HI>Staff</HI> of it that Morn|ing in Terms &s;o plain, as that he might ea&s;ily under&s;tand him; but that the <HI>Staff</HI> laugh'd in his Face, and pretend|ed to value him&s;elf in having done them that piece of Honour, in mak|ing them appear con&s;iderable in the Hou&s;e, and letting their Country hear their Names in an Account &s;o particu|larly agreeable to the Queen; but he did not notice to them, how it would make them hated among their Friends, and make the Pretender believe they had betray'd him.</P>
<P>My Lord, <HI>reply'd the other,</HI> you are moved indeed at this Treachery, and &s;o am I al&s;o; but you don't &s;ee all the Wheels of this Machin; we are all trick'd and bubbl'd from the Be|ginning; the Policy of this damn'd <HI>Staff</HI> has ruin'd us all; and we are
<PB N="21" REF="20">
wheedled in to be the In&s;trument of our own Di&s;appointment, by a Ma|nagement which none of us had Pe|netration enough to take notice. <Q>&startq;&endq;You know, my Lord, that you had en|gaged to the&mdash;to be ready whenever His M&mdash;y &s;hould give us Notice; and that he depended upon our Intere&s;t, and tho&s;e of my Lord&mdash;, and my Lord&mdash;, and the Earl of&mdash;, and the Duke of&mdash;, and we were able to make &s;uch a Stand for him, as &s;hould have turn'd the Scale of things, and, at lea&s;t, brought the Seat of the War to the Doors of our Enemies; but being flattered into a Notion, that the Work was to be done another Way; and made be|lieve, that the Queen Her &s;elf was willing to re&s;ign the Crown to <HI>the Pretender;</HI> and that our on|ly Way was to fall in with the <HI>Staff,</HI> and make our Intere&s;t at Court: By this fooli&s;h Notion, which you know our Countryman, my Lord&mdash;put into our Heads, we were prepared to be made Fools of, and to be taken with the Court Bait; for the Scheme of
<PB N="22" REF="21">
the <HI>Staff</HI> was only this, to have us per&s;waded with fine Words to come up to Parliament, and to take it for an Honour to be cho&s;en out of all the great Men of our Country, and the like; whereas the Drift of the <HI>Staff</HI> was only to get us up here &s;epa|rated from our Friends and Intere&s;t, where the Power is quite out of our Hands, and where we are not able to &s;tir Hand or Foot in the Service we are engaged in.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;&endq;Nor is this all; but here we are brought into things, not contrary to our Principles only, but &s;uch as will ruine our Reputation at Home, and with the K&mdash;abroad, and make us uncapable of doing him Service.</Q></P>
<P>Their Complaints grew afterwards more publick, by which they not only di&s;cover'd their Re&s;entment, but let into the Secret of that Management which drew them up to Parliament; and let us &s;ee, that while many People were expre&s;&s;ing their Re&s;entment at the <HI>Staff,</HI> for bringing &s;uch People to &s;it in the Hou&s;e; the <HI>Staff,</HI> if he really obtained them to be cho&s;en; for Hi|&s;tory is &s;ilent is that Part al&s;o, he did the greate&s;t Service to the Publick that

<P>If this was the Ca&s;e of the&s;e Men, it is certain no Step could be taken by them more to the Di&s;advantage of their Party, than to &s;uffer them&s;elves to be &s;ent up to Parliament; for whatever they might be at Home, them&s;elves were convinc'd that they were in&s;igni|ficant here, and not capable to do the lea&s;t Service to their Ma&s;ter the Pre|tender.</P>
<P>True it is, <HI>as above,</HI> that the <HI>Jaco|bites</HI> coming &s;o readily into the Service of the <HI>STAFF,</HI> was an Incident which had &s;ome evil Con&s;equences, and par|ticularly, that it gave Encouragement to their artificial Calumny, which &s;ome indu&s;triou&s;ly &s;trove to make popular, <HI>viz.</HI> That the <HI>Staff</HI> was for the Pre|tender; nay, that the Queen Her &s;elf was for the <HI>Pretender;</HI> things equally ab&s;urd, and the one as probable as the other: The <HI>Jacobites</HI> not being able to contain their Joy, were not only weak enough to believe it, but, in their fir&s;t Tran&s;ports, deliver'd them&s;elves in

<P>But Reproaches are &s;eldom taken off $y the &s;ame Hands which lay them $n; the <HI>Jacobites</HI> are the only Te&s;ti|$ony in this Ca&s;e, who, finding the <HI>Staff</HI> not for their Turn, tack about $om him, and, with more Subtilty than they had been Ma&s;ters of before, $ho&s;e a new Sett of Men to form an ntere&s;t with, and re&s;olved to try whe|ther they could make them&s;elves a|$ends upon the <HI>Staff,</HI> by &s;etting up a new Party again&s;t him, whether upon the Foot of their own Mea&s;ures, or of any other.</P>
<P>It was not difficult to find out Men, among the many, who might think their Merits greater than their Re|$ard, to whom &s;uch a Confidence night be committed, and who, either or private Intere&s;t, or wor&s;e De&s;igns, night be willing to &s;ee things take a new Turn.</P>

<P>Among the&s;e, we find the fir&s;t Cour$ Di&s;contents began, and, as was hinted in our fir&s;t Part of this Hi&s;tory, they made loud Complaints, that the <HI>Staff</HI> was not vigorous enough in pur&s;uing the Victory he had obtained over the <HI>Whigs;</HI> it &s;eems the&s;e Men, like the <HI>French Batalions</HI> at <HI>Barcelona,</HI> having taken the Town by Storm, claim'd their Right of the Pillage; they al|ledg'd the con&s;tant Cu&s;toms of War, as well a Party War as other, that, when the Victory was gain'd, they &s;hould fall upon the Plunder; and it was an

There were always &s;ome wi&s;er than the re&s;t in every Sett of Men in the World, and yet we find &s;ome of the&s;e overrul'd again&s;t their Judgments, by the Majority of their A&s;&s;ociates; there were &s;everal Men of Honour among tho&s;e warm People, who pre&s;s'd them not to carry their Di&s;putes up to a Breach with the <HI>White-Staff;</HI> and were it not that I &s;hould &s;eem to flat|ter, I &s;hould name the Man; but Ju|&s;tice mu&s;t take Place, what Cen&s;ures &s;oever follow.

<P>But the &s;ecret Part of this Hi&s;tory is, that there is a Woman in the Bottom of all this Matter; and as a Robbery in which the weaker Sex is concern'd is &s;aid to be mo&s;t bloody, &s;o a Plot, in a female Management, will be impetu|ous. His Lord&s;hip found them all un|tractable to his whole&s;ome Advice, and not to be mov'd by Intreaties or Per|&s;wa&s;ions, and only err'd in being car|ry'd down the Stream by the Pur&s;e and the Mitre.</P>
<P>This Recapitulation is made nece&s;|&s;ary by what went before, and brings me back to the Conduct of the <HI>Jaco|bites</HI> till this Time: Tho&s;e ea&s;y People had &s;upinely join'd in with the <HI>Staff,</HI> ob&s;equious to his Mea&s;ures, and blindly &s;ubmitting to all his Dictates, waiting the good Hour when they &s;hould &s;ee what none but &s;uch a Sett of Men as they, could have had Folly enough to think tolerable, <HI>viz.</HI> that when the Queen &s;hould dethrone Her&s;elf, the <HI>Staff</HI> re&s;ign to the Duke of <HI>P&mdash;th,</HI> the Mi|ni&s;try

turn <HI>Popi&s;h,</HI> and Her Maje&s;ty give up the Church, which Her Zeal to main|tain had co&s;t Her &s;o many unea&s;y Thoughts, and carry'd Her through &s;o many Difficulties and Hazards.</P>
<P>The&s;e things were &s;o prepo&s;terous, that it mu&s;t remain a Wonder to all thinking Men, that the&s;e People could continue at all under any &s;uch Delu&s;ion; but any one might have a&s;&s;ur'd him&s;elf they could not la&s;t long. The <HI>Jacobites,</HI> as is ob&s;erv'd, began to be impatient, and to &s;u&s;pect, that they were dup'd by the <HI>Staff,</HI> and look about for other Hands to engage with; the Rea&s;ons were in|deed cogent, which gave 'em Su&s;picions.</P>
<P>They &s;aw the <HI>Staff</HI> had brought the War to a Conclu&s;ion; and although the <HI>Whigs</HI> thought fit to exclaim again&s;t the Peace; yet they, (the <HI>Jacobites)</HI> when they came to examine the Particulars, found their Cau&s;e was wholly abandon'd. They found the <HI>French</HI> King had obtain|ed his Ends at the Expence of the Pre|tender; and that, to &s;et up King <HI>Philip,</HI> he had pull'd down the Pretender; they found effectually, by the Part which the <HI>French</HI> King acted abroad, that he had entirely laid a&s;ide any Thoughts for their Ma&s;ter; and that he bound him&s;elf in &s;uch a Manner, as no Chri&s;tian King e|ver broke, never to concern him&s;elf in
<PB N="31" REF="30">
their Ma&s;ter's Cau&s;e; they found that they had no Hopes in the <HI>French</HI> King's Honour to them, but what mu&s;t be founded on the greate&s;t Perfidy and Di&s;honour in the World; and that, to keep a verbal Promi&s;e to them, he mu&s;t, in the mo&s;t infamous Manner in the World, break all the A&s;&s;e|verations, Prote&s;tations, Renunciations, &amp;c. that it was po&s;&s;ible for a Prince to make.</P>
<P>But &s;uppo&s;e, for their Encouragement, they could think him perfidious to others, and true to their Ma&s;ter; they next enquir|ed into the Po&s;ture of his Affairs, and his Circum&s;tances in the World; either he had made a good Peace, or a bad Peace; either he needed a Peace, or needed not.</P>
<P>If, as the <HI>Whigs</HI> &s;ay, the King of <HI>France</HI> was at the Door of Ruin; that another Campaign had overwhelm'd him and all his Kingdoms; and that he was not able to have held out another Year; then it mu&s;t be undeniably true, that he &s;tood in great Need of a Peace.</P>
<P>If then he &s;tood in &s;uch Need of a Peace, it was not likely that he would break it a|gain for their Ma&s;ter, who&s;e Intere&s;t was de&s;perate, and placing on the Throne &s;o difficult, as that, in his highe&s;t Pro&s;perity, he could never bring it to pa&s;s: If, on the other Hand, he did not &s;tand in Need of a Peace, why did he give up &s;o much to ob|tain it?</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="31">
Yet farther; they con&s;ider'd that either the <HI>French</HI> King had obtain'd a good Peace, or &s;ubmitted to a bad one; if a good one, he could &s;upport the Sugge&s;tion of his be|ing willing to break it; if a bad one, why then have the <HI>Whigs</HI> been &s;o warm in complaining again&s;t it?</P>
<P>The&s;e things fir&s;t open'd the Eyes of the <HI>Jacobites</HI> in this Nation, and from the re|peated Accounts they had from abroad, how impo&s;&s;ible it was to obtain any A&s;|&s;i&s;tance from the King of <HI>France;</HI> but that, on the contrary, he had oblig'd him&s;elf to acknowledge the <HI>Hanover</HI> Succe&s;&s;ion, and never to oppo&s;e the &s;ame: By which A|ction, whenever he &s;hould perform the &s;ame, they knew he would put it out of his Power, or the Power of all the <HI>Popi&s;h</HI> Na|tions, or Kings in <HI>Europe,</HI> to &s;et up the Pre|tender: I &s;ay, by the&s;e things they were thought to de&s;pair, and that with a great deal of Ju&s;tice, of any Expectation for their Ma&s;ter, or his Cau&s;e, from the <HI>White Staff.</HI></P>
<P>The &s;ame Arguments which open'd the Eyes of tho&s;e &s;tupify'd People the <HI>Jacobites,</HI> mu&s;t, and will, in time, &s;ilence the Tongues of tho&s;e Men, who would &s;till per&s;wade us, that the <HI>Staff</HI> was in the Intere&s;t of the Pretender; and till they return to the U&s;e of their Rea&s;on in tho&s;e things, the Con|clu&s;ions they draw from Pa&s;&s;ions mov'd by Party, are of no Weight at all, or worth a|ny Ob&s;ervation.</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="32">
The Rea&s;on of the la&s;t Peace; the Manner of its Tran&s;acting; the Circum|&s;tances moving to it; the Authority do|ing it; and all the Objections made about it, are Things not now before me, they have been Debated and Determin'd in Parliament. But thus much belongs to this <HI>Secret Hi&s;tory,</HI> as it concerns the Intere&s;t of the Pretender, <HI>viz.</HI> That &s;o much was done as effectually convinc'd the <HI>Jacobites,</HI> that they were abandon'd by <HI>France,</HI> and made after off by the <HI>Staff;</HI> that the fir&s;t had given the Pre|tender up, and the la&s;t had made the <HI>Hannover</HI> Succe&s;&s;ion be recogniz'd by the only Per&s;on in the World, that could have done any thing to make it un&s;ecure, and the <HI>Jacobites</HI> were &s;o effectually con|vinc'd of this, that from that time forward they mortally hated the <HI>Staff,</HI> and never &s;lipt any Occa&s;ion of letting him know it; and yet in &s;aying this I cannot blame the <HI>Jacobites,</HI> for they had Rea&s;on to do &s;o: Other Mini&s;try's oppre&s;s'd them, double tax'd them, and fenc'd the Na|tion again&s;t them, but &s;till they had &s;ome|thing to hope from their faithful and powerful Ally the King of <HI>France,</HI> but this damn'd <HI>Staff,</HI> to make u&s;e of their own Expre&s;&s;ion, gave them the <HI>Coup de</HI>
<PB N="34" REF="33">
<HI>Grace,</HI> gave them a mortal Stab in the tendere&s;t and mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible Part, tying their powerful Friend, on whom their Ma&s;ter &s;ub&s;i&s;ted, on whom their Cau&s;e de|pended, Hand and Foot, from ever be|ing either willing, or able to help them.</P>
<P>Thus the <HI>Staff,</HI> even by this Peace, of which &s;uch Complaint is made, &s;truck at the Root of <HI>Jacobites,</HI> and de&s;troy'd the very Foundation of their Hopes; all that could retain the Name of <HI>Jacobiti&s;m</HI> in the World, was only to be found in the Intreagues of Parties at home, where if there was any real danger of it at all it was owing to the unnatural Warmth with which private Per&s;ons per&s;wade one another, upon the account of their Differences about Places at Court, In|tere&s;t in their Prince, Property, Party and Religion.</P>
<P>The <HI>Jacobites</HI> being reduced to this Condition, it is no Wonder that when they found any Di&s;contents and Un|ea&s;ine&s;s between tho&s;e who had the Ad|mini&s;tration of Affairs in their Hands, they immediately fell in with one Side to blow up the Coal, and prevent the healing the Wound, which indeed would have been their Ruin.</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="34">
But a Que&s;tion offers it &s;elf to be &s;poken to here, <HI>viz.</HI> If the <HI>Staff</HI> had been in the Intere&s;t of the Pretender, why then upon the Breach at Court, of which mention has been &s;o often made in the&s;e Hi&s;tories, did the <HI>Jacobites</HI> not clo&s;e with the <HI>Staff,</HI> but univer&s;ally to a Man, take part with his Supplanters? Some infer from thence, that all in the Project of the New Court Faction, were in the Secret, and had taken Mea&s;ures for the Intere&s;t of the Pretender, which I do not allow, neither was my Lord&mdash;, who has had his Share in the Opinion of that Kind, given any ju&s;t occa&s;ion for that Cen&s;ure, other than what is already mention'd, of entertaining and employ|ing <HI>Jacobite</HI> In&s;truments, but having not the &s;ame Genius to manage the <HI>Jaco|bites</HI> as the <HI>Staff</HI> had &s;hewn in the Pa&s;|&s;ages above, and which is more, not the &s;ame Opportunity; he has left him|&s;elf the more expo&s;ed to that Calumny than the <HI>Staff</HI> did.</P>
<P>For now the <HI>Jacobites</HI> were alarm'd at their former U&s;age, and began to &s;peak of making Terms for them&s;elves, if the <HI>Staff</HI> &s;tood in need of their help, when Men were number'd by the Pole, and not by the Weight they bore in the

Nation: <HI>Tho&s;e Men &s;tood</HI> in need of them both ways, and as they could not have them at &s;o cheap a Rate as the <HI>Staff,</HI> it was more rea&s;onable to think they might bid high for them, and perhaps engage with them farther than they were ever likely to be able to perform. So that on the&s;e Accounts po&s;&s;ibly there might be more Ground for the Nation of the Danger of the Pretender, than there could be under the Admini&s;tration of the <HI>Staff.</HI> This is farther evinc'd from the Nature of the Alliance between the <HI>Jacobites</HI> and the <HI>New Party,</HI> and from the Character of tho&s;e who had the Helm of that Affair, or at lea&s;t who had the chief Hand in forming the <HI>New Party.</HI></P>
<P>The principal occa&s;ion of the Peoples mi&s;grounding at this time their Cen&s;ures, ari&s;es from their mi&s;taking the Per&s;on of him who was to be their <HI>Prime Mini|&s;ter,</HI> which (except to a few) is a My|&s;tery not yet di&s;covered.

<P>If Characters would give any Light unto Things of this Nature, it might be needful to know the Di&s;po&s;ition of the&s;e Three, that from thence the Judicious may enquire, whether what has been &s;aid, relating to the intercour&s;e between them and the late <HI>Staff;</HI> and al&s;o rela|ting to the Methods which the&s;e Three had pre&s;crib'd for the future Govern|ment of Things is fit to be believ'd or not: The fir&s;t of the&s;e was of the &s;ubtle Sex, Cunning, but willing to be thought much more &s;o than &s;he was; &s;he had in&s;inuated her &s;elf into Favour, more by the want of Merit in tho&s;e that went before her, than by any real Significan|cy in her &s;elf: Her fir&s;t Court was made to her Advantange, by the large Field of Scandal &s;he had to range over, in the Character of her Predece&s;&s;ors, her Royal Mi&s;tre&s;s, the Patern of every ami|cable Quality, and the true Patrone&s;s of Vertue, naturally abhorring every Crime, could not avoid having &s;ome growing E&s;teem for her, who daily de|tected the Wickedne&s;s of tho&s;e who long before had abus'd the Goodne&s;s of their Benefactor, every In&s;olence which a

wounded both the Queen and her &s;elf, and the &s;truggle it produc'd in the Brea&s;t of Her Maje&s;ty, between her Ju&s;tice and her Affection, can no otherwi&s;e be ex|pre&s;s'd than by that Black which now the Nation wears for the Con&s;equences of it.</P>
<P>The Second of the&s;e was of the Church, but of that &s;ort who neither bring it Honour, or do it Service, like as Dr. <HI>Sa|cheverel,</HI> but of much more dangerous a Quality, by how much his Capacities and Intere&s;t infinitely exceeded him, un+&s;ufferably haughty &s;uperrogant and enter|prizing, re&s;tle&s;s and indefatigable in pur|&s;uing his De&s;ign, and ambitious beyond Mea&s;ure in their exorbitant Extent, vain of directing the greate&s;t Heads, and his Envoy never remitted the re&s;i&s;tance of tho&s;e who declin'd his Schemes.</P>
<P>The <HI>Staff</HI> had frequently admitted him to the Concerts of publick Matters, but &s;eeing the precipitancy of his Temper, kept him at <HI>Bay</HI> as to Secrets, and acted with re&s;erve to him in the <HI>Arcana.</HI> Impatient of this Treatment, he &s;trove all the ways po&s;&s;ible to remove the Dif|fidence, and obtain to be Tutor to the Prime Mini&s;ter, which the Staff, not u&s;ed to Leading-Strings, could not be
<PB N="41" REF="40">
brought to: He left no Politick Me|thod une&s;&s;ayed to bring this to pa&s;s; but &s;till the <HI>Staff</HI> was too old for him.</P>
<P>His Temper being le&s;s able to bear an Affront than to give one, and his Warmth carrying him &s;ometimes out of his own Government, he laid his own Character too open in his Heat, and by the Me|thods he took to bring him&s;elf in, help'd to convince the <HI>Staff</HI> of the nece&s;&s;ity of keeping him out, while he appear'd an Eccle&s;ia&s;tick, and like a true Chri&s;tian Bi&s;hop, confin'd him&s;elf to that ju&s;t Concern for the Church, which every Man in his Station ought to have: His Excur&s;ions pa&s;s'd for Religion, and his private and mo&s;t pernicious Crimes were cover'd by that which &s;ome call Zeal, but when the States-Man appear'd be|neath the Cape, they mu&s;t have been very much Torch-lighted who could not have di&s;cern'd the very Sen&s;e of all &s;orts of Tyranny in every Step of his Con|duct; and that it was even more natural to his Temper than to his Profe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>His abhorrence of a mild Government, and aver&s;ion to the Liberty of the Sub|jects, gave ju&s;t Rea&s;on to believe he would be for the Pretender, were it but from a meer Inclination to be Arbitrary;
<PB N="42" REF="41">
and &s;ome have thought that the Con|tempt which he &s;hew'd for the <HI>Prote&s;tant Succe&s;&s;ion,</HI> was more the product $word$ $is Hatred to the Con&s;titution than to the Hou&s;e of <HI>Hannover.</HI> I will not &s;ay he was in any concerted League with the Court of <HI>Barleduc,</HI> but if I &s;hould &s;ay I believe he was not in that Intere&s;t, it mu&s;t be &s;poken with more Charity than Sincerity.</P>
<P>The <HI>Staff,</HI> who was always a pro|fe&s;s'd Enemy to ra&s;h Councils, had ne|ver made it his Choice to differ with him, knowing that he was not a Man that one would choo&s;e for an Enemy, altho' he was a Man one would be &s;ure to overcome; but his very Di&s;po&s;ition drove the <HI>Staff</HI> to an ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity of oppo&s;ing him, or of falling with him.</P>
<P>Such was his Gu&s;t for an Arbitrary Government, that he made all moderate Mea&s;ures appear Criminal, and arraign'd the Ciemency of the Admini&s;tration, as a Negligence of the <HI>Staff,</HI> and an Omi&s;|&s;ion of Duty, and with an Impetuo&s;ity natural to his Temper, He was one of the fir&s;t who fell upon the <HI>Staff,</HI> plow|ing with the Heifer, found a Cabal in the Admini&s;tration, which oppo&s;ed all the Mea&s;ures of the Prime Mini&s;ter,
<PB N="43" REF="42">
and acted independent of him, upon whom the general Calumny of their Action lay.</P>
<P>This explains the meaning of what was &s;aid in the fir&s;t Part of this Hi&s;tory, <HI>viz.</HI> That the <HI>Staff</HI> was really out of his Power long before he was out of his Po&s;t, and that Things were carry'd over his Belly, which however he bears the Reproach of, he had no other Concern in than that he &s;ubmitted to bear them in Duty to Her Maje&s;ty, who was inclin'd at fir&s;t to believe the&s;e Men meant hone&s;t|ly, and that &s;o much Folly could not belong to a Man, who&s;e Conduct &s;he had &s;een Rea|&s;on to have formerly &s;o good an Opinion of, the Misfortune was, that Her Maje&s;ty lived ju&s;t to &s;ee &s;he was mi&s;taken, but not long enough to re&s;ent it.</P>
<P>The Chararacter of the Pur&s;e is too well known to dwell upon, and &s;carce to be enter'd upon with Decency, I take no liberty with his Moral or Per&s;onal Infirmities in Times pa&s;t, which may &s;erve to convince, that the pre&s;ent Bu|&s;ine&s;s is not to bla&s;ten the Men, but to mention &s;o much of the Truth as is needful to make them known: It is enough to &s;ay that the Opinion the other Confederated Per&s;ons had of him, and
<PB N="44" REF="43">
for which they embark'd him, was found|ed on his Power, not his Capacity, and he he gave more Weight to them by his Office than his Intere&s;t. In State Matters he was rather an Agent than an Employer, and was in Reality among them no more than that Thing which <HI>Hudibras</HI> &s;ays <HI>wi&s;e Men work with.</HI></P>
<P>His Pa&s;&s;ion for a hot and furious ma|nagement of Things carry'd him away from his Union with the <HI>Staff,</HI> to whom he had a million of Obligations, and the hopes of being Prime Mini&s;ter in an Ar|bitrary De&s;potick Admini&s;tration, led him to pu&s;h at the <HI>Staff,</HI> with the Ha|zard of Queen, Con&s;titution and Suc|ce&s;&s;ion: It is thought that Avarice led this Per&s;on fa&s;ter to an Ambition, and that he did not &s;o much a&s;pire at the Honour as at the Profit of his Party. Hence <HI>Cromwell,</HI> as <HI>Oliver</HI> was ju&s;tly &s;aid to be an U&s;urper, tho' without a Crown, &s;o he doubted not to obtain the Mini|&s;try without the <HI>Staff,</HI> in which how|ever &s;ome People &s;candalize his Under|&s;tanding, and thinks his Politicks were as weak as his Eye-&s;ight.</P>
<P>This <HI>Juncto</HI> of the New Party are tho&s;e of whom the former part of this Hi&s;tory has &s;aid &s;o much, and to whom
<PB N="45" REF="44">
the <HI>Staff</HI> directed the Speech mention'd at his rece&s;s.</P>
<P>It is &s;aid by Fame, that Mea&s;ures were concerted by &s;ome of tho&s;e, not only to the prejudice of the <HI>Prote&s;tant Succe&s;&s;ion,</HI> but even of the Prote&s;tant <HI>Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or,</HI> and that &s;ome Progre&s;s was made in the Matter, but I will not load them with Things which I think have their Foun|dation in the common Prejudices, un|le&s;s farther Proof was made of the Par|ticulars, neither &s;hall this Di&s;cour&s;e which I call a Hi&s;tory, deviate into the Nature of Remarks upon their Conduct, or examine how far they have Grounds for &s;uch a Reproach.</P>
<P>It is true, two &s;orts of People fell in with the&s;e Men; <HI>Fir&s;t</HI> the <HI>Jacobites</HI> to a Man, who having found them&s;elves made a Je&s;t of by the <HI>Staff,</HI> thought this the way both to faciliate the De&s;ign they had laid for the Pretender, and at the &s;ame time to revenge them&s;elves of the <HI>Staff,</HI> for making Tools of them, as has been &s;aid already: And <HI>Secondly,</HI> All tho&s;e who having been Malecontent at the Admini&s;tration of the <HI>Staff</HI> upon any other Account, either publick or pri|vate, who thought that either he had not done them Ju&s;tice in their particular
<PB N="46" REF="45">
Concerns, or that by depo&s;ing him <HI>Staff,</HI> they might make their way into the up|per end of the Admini&s;tration, or act with more Satisfaction in the Po&s;ts they then enjoy'd.</P>
<P>The Conjunction of the <HI>Jacobites</HI> had the &s;ame Effect upon them, which it had before upon the <HI>Staff, viz.</HI> it open'd the Mouths of the <HI>Whigs</HI> again&s;t tho&s;e New Managers, as being in the Intere&s;t of the Pretender; I cannot &s;ay that there was not much more Rea&s;on for this Scandal at that time than there was in the Ca&s;e of the <HI>Staff,</HI> becau&s;e the <HI>Jacobites</HI> had gather'd Strength by the late Divi&s;ion, <HI>as in all divided Nations the Enemies of tho&s;e Nations always do,</HI> and which was more, having been lately dupp'd and kick'd up and down by the <HI>Staff,</HI> till they became the common ridicule of the Court, they were even wi&s;er and more wary, and pretended to &s;tand up|on Terms with tho&s;e Men before they acted with them.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t do that Ju&s;tice to the other Party in the Mini&s;try, who adher'd to the&s;e Men, <HI>to &s;ay,</HI> that whatever parti|cular Mea&s;ures they had in View, and which perhaps led them with more ha&s;t than &s;peed, to break with the <HI>Staff,</HI> yet
<PB N="47" REF="46">
that they never went into their &s;everal Mea&s;ures, or entertain'd any Thought in favour of the Pretender, and there|fore there is no doubt but had they con|tinued &s;ome time longer, they mu&s;t have parted from the Pur&s;e, as the <HI>Staff</HI> had done before them; for the Mea&s;ures which the <HI>Three</HI> drove at, would no more have con&s;i&s;ted with the Captain than it had done with the Colonel; and as the <HI>Three</HI> drove at all, it was impo&s;|&s;ible they could go long together, un|le&s;s the Captain would have play'd the &s;ame de&s;perate Game they were going on with, which it is plain, having not the &s;ame de&s;perate Fortunes upon his Hands, he had neither occa&s;ion for, or Folly enough to be drawn into. And here it is worthy Remark, That the Friends of the <HI>Staff</HI> need look no far|ther back for a Rea&s;on, why they found them&s;elves delay'd, and their Expecta|tions not an&s;wer'd in Bu&s;ine&s;s of any &s;ort, which they attended upon him for, and for the di&s;appointment thereof they frequently entertain'd hard Thoughts of the <HI>Staff</HI> It was ever his peculiar Aver|&s;ion to keep People in &s;u&s;pen&s;e, who had their Reque&s;ts depending on him, and the Dependance and Attendance,
<PB N="48" REF="47">
which is the langui&s;hing De&s;erts of tho&s;e who have Expectation at Court, were always thought by him to be both unj$&s;t to them, and unnece&s;&s;arily exacted by Mini&s;ters of State; but he had &s;ecret Re&s;traints upon him from the&s;e Men, and from the&s;e Methods taken by a &s;ecret Party again&s;t him, which render'd him uncapable of ren|dering tho&s;e Services, and granting tho&s;e Favours, which were even the ju&s;t and cu&s;tomary Con&s;equences of his Employ, and which tho&s;e who preceeded him had always in their Power.</P>
<P>The&s;e were &s;ome of the Rea&s;ons why &s;everal important Po&s;ts were kept vacant, and why Things proper to be deter|mined were oftentimes delay'd: Why the Expectations, which many had ju&s;t Rea&s;ons given them to entertain, could not be an&s;wer'd: Nay, why promis'd Favours were frequently left unperform'd, contrary to the Inclination, and perhaps to the Intention of the <HI>Staff.</HI></P>
<P>Nay, to go farther, the di&s;placing of many in Office, in whom there had ap|pear'd neither want of Merit, or breach of Conduct, as to Parties, was owing to the Oppre&s;&s;ion of the <HI>Staff,</HI> by the&s;e Men who &s;eem inclin'd to do &s;everal
<PB N="49" REF="48">
Things which perhaps would not other|wi&s;e have been done, as well to let the <HI>Staff</HI> &s;ee they could give a <HI>Check</HI> to him by their Intere&s;t, as al&s;o to bring the publick Odium of tho&s;e Things upon him and his Admini&s;tration, which was really due to their &s;ecret Influence.</P>
<P>All the&s;e Things &s;erved to convince the <HI>Staff,</HI> that while the&s;e Men obtain'd leave to encroach upon him in this man|ner, there was a nece&s;&s;ity for Her Ma|je&s;ty to be convinc'd by &s;ome Means or other of the Mi&s;chief they aim'd at, and this at la&s;t appear'd impracticable, with|out his con&s;enting to the remove of the <HI>Staff.</HI></P>
<P>And indeed as <HI>John Bull</HI> was always found to be in his Services, when Things of &s;uch a nice Nature came before him, no Man can be &s;o weak to believe he could be drawn into the Game, which the&s;e People were playing; it is true, he is now in the <HI>Staff</HI>'s &s;tead as to the <HI>Odium</HI> of tho&s;e Practices, and the Current of the Times bears down all that can be &s;aid in his Defence: Our Hi&s;tory there|fore &s;hall only enter this Caveat in his Favour in few Words, and leave it to Time to make the Truth of it appear, <HI>viz.</HI> he neither had Folly enough to en|gage in &s;o prepo&s;terous an Attempt as
<PB N="50" REF="49">
that of the Pretender, nor had he Igno|rance enough to be led by the People, our Hi&s;tory is now mentioning, into any thing what&s;oever, and if he join'd with them in any Mea&s;ures at all, it was on this Foot, That he knew them too well, not to believe he could one time or o|ther turn them from their new Projects, or overturn them in the Pro&s;ecution of them.</P>
<P>But to return to the <HI>Staff:</HI> Having &s;aid thus much of the People who oppos'd him, it is needful to begin where our fir&s;t Part left off. I have mention'd the Mea&s;ures they began to take, even while the <HI>Staff</HI> yet kept his Ground; how they acted with an independency as to the <HI>Staff,</HI> placed and di&s;placed, put in and put out, not only without him, but a|gain&s;t him, which brought the <HI>Staff</HI> to the nece&s;&s;ity of delivering him&s;elf from hearing the Hatred and Calumny which that kind of Admini&s;tration nece&s;&s;arily brings with it, and which, let who&s;oever be the Agent, is always &s;ure to fall upon the Prime Mini&s;ter: And this was one weighty Rea&s;on which made the remove of the <HI>Staff</HI> ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to him.</P>
<P>While the &s;aid Remove was thus un|der his Deliberation, the <HI>Staff</HI> was not wanting to him&s;elf, in letting the Queen
<PB N="51" REF="50">
know what Hands &s;he was falling into; and to lay before Her Maje&s;ty a true State of Her Affairs, <HI>viz.</HI> What the&s;e Men aim'd at, to what their Manage|ment naturally tended, and what Extre|mities they would certainly reduce Things to; how they would exa&s;perate the People by the ju&s;t Fears and Jealou|&s;ies of the Succe&s;&s;ion, which their Conduct would infu&s;e into them; how they would allarm the Neighbouring Powers, who were intru&s;ted in the Prote&s;tant Succe&s;&s;ion; how they would certainly bring Her Maje&s;ty to a nece&s;&s;ity of &s;ub|mitting to &s;ome mean Step, for the Sa|tisfaction of Her Subjects, or of falling into the&s;e Mea&s;ures, which this Faction would be fatal to the publick Peace, and dangerous to her Per&s;on and Go|vernment.</P>
<P>The&s;e Repre&s;entations had wrought &s;o far, as that it was very evident the Queen began to be mov'd, and Her Maje&s;ty, who was not &s;o uncapable of receiving ju&s;t Impre&s;&s;ions from Truth, clearly re|pre&s;ented as Her Enemies imagin'd, had made &s;ome Steps towards con|vincing the World that She was not a|bandon'd to the Enchantments of the Cabal, but that She had both Eyes to &s;ee
<PB N="52" REF="51">
when She was impos'd upon, and Re|&s;olution to re&s;ent it.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Di&s;covery of this Alteration in the Q&mdash;was &s;een by Her Ma|je&s;ty's di&s;po&s;ing the <HI>Staff,</HI> as has been &s;aid, to the A&s;toni&s;hment and Surprize of the <HI>Three,</HI> of whom mention is made already: What Confu&s;ion this was to them; how they behav'd in it; what Exclamation they made when they came to talk together, after the Blow was given, the&s;e have been taken Notice of, and there the fir&s;t Part of this Hi&s;tory ended.</P>
<P>The &s;ub&s;equent Conduct of the <HI>Three</HI> cannot take up much room, &s;eeing it contains but the Hi&s;tory of four or five Days, and tho&s;e being all Days of Con|fu&s;ion and Di&s;traction, from the &s;urpri|&s;ing Fate of Her late Maje&s;ty; which as it fill'd all Her Loyal and Faithful Subjects with Grief and affectionate Complain|ings, &s;o it nece&s;&s;arily ca&s;t this Faction into Terrors and Apprehen&s;ions of many Kinds.</P>
<P>They found them&s;elves young in their Intreagues, di&s;concerted and undeter|min'd in their Mea&s;ures; they had not been long enough enter'd to have commu|nicated their De&s;igns, even to tho&s;e who
<PB N="53" REF="52">
were ready to come into them, or to have given In&s;tructions to tho&s;e to whom they had communicated their De&s;igns: They had not had time &s;o much as to form them &s;elves, or to pitch upon the In&s;truments by which they were to act; as in other Ca&s;es popular De&s;igns have been defea|ted for want of a Head, &s;o tho&s;e &s;unk of them&s;elves for want of a Tail; they had not brought in their Men, or &s;o much as intimated to the Men they had mark'd out their Intentions of bringing them in.</P>
<P>In every Step they had taken, they found that the late <HI>Staff</HI> was before them, which way &s;oever they turn'd they found him in their Way, and prepar'd to &s;upplant and countermine them: That his Intere&s;t was too &s;trong for them to &s;truggle with, and his Head too long for them to &s;ucceed in any Thing that he oppos'd them in. The Q&mdash;had &s;truck the killing Blow to them ju&s;t be|fore Death &s;truck that fatal Blow on her Life, and they found them&s;elves de|priv'd of that A&s;&s;i&s;tance which they de|pended on from their Intere&s;t in Her Maje&s;ty's Favour: So that the whole Frame of their Project was di&s;-jointed,
<PB N="54" REF="53">
and not a Hand among them was able to &s;et it together again.</P>
<P>In this Exigence they were likewi&s;e attended with that con&s;tant Companion of evil De&s;igns, <HI>viz.</HI> Jealou&s;y, and Di|&s;tru&s;t of one another, with apprehen|&s;ions for their re&s;pective Safety and Fear, lea&s;t every one &s;hould make his Peace at the expence of the re&s;t.</P>
<P>By this time the Certainty of the Queen's Death &s;tared in their Faces, the Con&s;titution of their Country appear'd a formidable Enemy to all the Schemes which their New Confederates the <HI>Ja|cobites</HI> had pretended to lay before them: Not a Man of them had the Courage to &s;tir Hand or Foot in favour of any Thing that oppos'd the <HI>Prote&s;tant Succe&s;&s;ion;</HI> and yet they &s;aw plainly the Fate of all their Mea&s;ures in that Suc|ce&s;&s;ion, nay, even in the fir&s;t propo&s;al of it.</P>
<P>The Po&s;ts which one of them were in, depriv'd them of liberty of being pa&s;&s;ive; and the fir&s;t active Part they could po&s;&s;ibly appear in, would put the Knife to the Throat of their own Schemes, and be a delivering them&s;elves up bound Hand and Foot into the Hands of their mortal Enemies <HI>the Whigs.</HI></P>
<P>In this Di&s;tre&s;s the fir&s;t Comfort they
<PB N="55" REF="54">
had was to &s;ee them&s;elves abandon'd by all their Friends <HI>to a Man,</HI> e&s;pecially of tho&s;e who were not oblig'd by their Offices to &s;hew them&s;elves in publick. Hi&s;tory has made no mention of their Female A&s;&s;i&s;tant, &s;ave that <HI>to do her Ju|&s;tice,</HI> &s;he faithfully di&s;charged the Duty of her Place to the Per&s;on of the Q&mdash;in her la&s;t Extremities, and was a &s;incere Mourner for Her Maje&s;ty's Death, which &s;he had indeed more Rea&s;on for than any Woman about the Court could pretend to.</P>
<P>The <HI>Eccle&s;ia&s;tick</HI> is &s;aid to have given a Loo&s;e to his Pa&s;&s;ion, which boiling up to De&s;pair, cau&s;ed him to go off the Stage <HI>raving,</HI> having neither Grace to repent of what was pa&s;s'd, or Patience to con&s;ider of what was to come.</P>
<P>The <HI>Pur&s;e,</HI> ever fal&s;e to good Mea&s;ures, and impotent in bad ones, di&s;cover'd the tottering Principles which he had always acted upon, and &s;tood wavering between every Opinion, when the only Man among them, who might be call'd a Mini&s;ter of State, and <HI>as is ob&s;erv$d,</HI> had retain'd his <HI>Sen&s;es</HI> and Principles, took this occa&s;ion to &s;peak, and <HI>as I have been inform'd</HI> by a few Words, di&s;&s;olv'd all the Confede|racy.</P>

This Lord <HI>John Bull,</HI> as I have heard it related, finding the People I am &s;peaking of in a general Confu&s;ion, and at a full &s;tand in their Councils, as willing to do Evil as' ever, but without Power to act, a&s;toni&s;hed at their own Circum&s;tances, and e&s;pecially at what they &s;aw approaching, under|took to break in upon their Silence, in Words to the Purpo&s;e following:</P>

as he was well a&s;&s;ur'd, no Per&s;on there had entertained any Sentiments con|trary to the Common Good of the Kingdom, &s;o no one can be at a Lo&s;s what Mea&s;ures they were to enter upon, at the pre&s;ent juncture. <HI>He told them,</HI> they all knew that the Succe&s;&s;ion of the Crown was limited to the Hou&s;e of <HI>Hanover,</HI> That the Elector of <HI>Brun&s;|wick,</HI> being the elde&s;t Branch of that Hou&s;e, was the Heir apparent; and be&s;ides, what their Duty oblig'd them to: He thought the Wi&s;e&s;t Step they could take, was to declare them&s;elves Early, as well to make effectual Provi|&s;ion for the Peaceable Succe&s;&s;ion of the Right Heir, and letting the Succe&s;&s;or have that &s;ea&s;onable Te&s;timony of their Duty, as to convince the People, who had been Prejudic'd at their Conduct that they had done them Wrong. <HI>H$ told them,</HI> that however he gave his own Opinion, he would Pre&s;cribe to none of them, but he might tell them that as he had &s;incerely Abjured the <HI>Pre|tender,</HI> he never entertain'd any though in his Favour; taking all the Notion of his Succeeding here to be Ridicu|lous, and the Schemes of tho&s;e Me$ who had &s;poken favourably of his com|ing
<PB N="59" REF="58">
to the Crown, to be meer Amu&s;e|ments, and no more; that as he never had any De&s;ign again&s;t the <HI>Prote&s;tant Succe&s;&s;ion,</HI> &s;o whatever Treatment he might meet with from the Elector of <HI>Hanover,</HI> yet he would di&s;charge his Duty to his Country, and do as an Hone&s;t Man ought to do.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;&endq;Be&s;ides <HI>he reminded them</HI> of the Penal|ties provided by the Acts of Parliament, e&s;pecially on &s;uch of them as were by Office appointed to Admini&s;ter the Go|vernment after the Decea&s;e of the Queen, and till the Arrival of the Succe&s;&s;or: And how it was no le&s;s than <HI>High-Trea&s;on</HI> for them to refu&s;e or delay to proclaim the <HI>Prote&s;tant Succe&s;&s;or. He told them,</HI> he did not &s;ay this to de|clare him&s;elf only, for he knew his Duty, and what he was always deter|min'd to do; but the Arguments he us'd were for their Safety and Advantage, not his own. He acknowledg'd, that he believ'd as things &s;tood then, that upon the Arrival of the Succe&s;&s;or, the <HI>Whigs</HI> would recover their Intere&s;t in the Ad|mini&s;tration, which he was Sorry for, not only on Account of his own parti|cular Affair, but on the Account of the Publick; but he declared that he would rather bring in the <HI>Whigs</HI> him&s;elf, tho'
<PB N="60" REF="59">
he was &s;ure to be de&s;troy'd by them, than be concern'd with any one in bring|ing in the <HI>Popi&s;h Pretender,</HI> which could have no other Effect, than the Ruin of his Country, and the Involving us all in a Civil War; making <HI>Britain</HI> a Field of Blood,</Q> and the Seat of a De&s;olating War.</P>
<P>It was ea&s;y to perceive that this di&s;cour&s;e did not plea&s;e tho&s;e to whom he &s;poke; but the Juncture was &s;o nice, that not one of them that ever I heard of dur&s;t declare him&s;elf; they &s;aw the Danger that was before them, had no confidence in one a|nother, and lo&s;ing all the Courage they had pretended to before, they &s;eem'd to joyn with Lord <HI>John Bull</HI> in all he had &s;aid, and &s;hew'd a kind of an Allacrity, tho' awkward, and di&s;&s;embled, to that which inwardly wounded them to the Soul: However, having formally a&s;&s;ented, I hear it was a&s;ked by one of them, what it was they had next to do; to which Lord <HI>John Bull</HI> an&s;wered directly thus, <Q>&startq;&endq;You &s;ee evidently the Ca&s;e, the Queen is a Dead Woman, it is impo&s;&s;ible in the Ordinary cour&s;e of Nature that &s;he can Recover, as you have heard from the Phy&s;icians ju&s;t now: My opinion is, That we appoint a Council to Meet im|mediately, and Summon all the Mem|bers,
<PB N="61" REF="60">
whether of one Party or another; and propo&s;e to them the &s;ending an Ex|pre&s;s to <HI>Hanover,</HI> to give his Electoral Highne&s;s an Account of the Queen's Condition, and to de&s;ire him to ha&s;ten over, in order by his pre&s;ence to &s;ecure a Peaceable ea&s;y Acce&s;&s;ion to the Crown; and as to our &s;elves, we mu&s;t take our fate in the Next Reign, the pre&s;ent being evidently at the point of Expiration.</Q></P>
<P>This would not be a faithful Hi&s;tory, if it was not ob&s;erv'd here, that the Hi&s;to|rian does not affirm that this Di&s;cour&s;e was really &s;poken Word for Word by Lord <HI>John Bull,</HI> having not the &s;ame a&s;&s;urance thereof, as of what has been mention'd to be &s;aid in the former part of this Hi&s;tory, if re&s;pect to Lord <HI>John</HI> has made the Hi&s;torian freer in relating what for his Lord&s;hips &s;ake he Wi&s;hes were true, it is hoped this may be a fault more Par|donable, than omitting it would be if true.</P>
<P>Let it therefore be &s;uppos'd to be &s;poken, or Words to that purpo&s;e, until it &s;hall by a better Authority be contra|dicted, when if it appears a mi&s;take, the Hi&s;torian will acknowledge him&s;elf to be Mi&s;inform'd.</P>
<P>Till when, I go on with my Account as Fame deliver'd it to the Relater <HI>(viz.)</HI>
<PB N="62" REF="61">
that Lord <HI>John Bull</HI> having deliver'd him|&s;elf in this manner, the Meeting broke up immediately; and that there was no room to He&s;itate, one indeed &s;eem'd to Re|gret the Nece&s;&s;ity, and they &s;ay, ro&s;e up expre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf &s;oftly, &s;o as very few heard him to the purpo&s;e, <HI>Well, if it mu&s;t be &s;o!</HI> What further he &s;aid, or intended to &s;ay, I believe was not under&s;tood by any but him&s;elf: But as I ob&s;erv'd, there was no room to He&s;itate, the &s;everal Acts of Parliament in Force, and made on purpo&s;e for this Exigence, were &s;o forci|ble, and had provided for every Cir|cum&s;tance in &s;uch a Manner, that there was no room for any Man, tho' never &s;o much inclin'd to it, to offer the lea&s;t Interruption at &s;uch a juncture; no Man dur&s;t open his lips again&s;t what <HI>Lord John</HI> had propo&s;ed, or &s;o much as &s;hew him&s;elf backward in the propos'd appli|cation to the <HI>Prote&s;tant Succe&s;&s;or,</HI> which accordingly went on as was Re&s;olv'd.</P>
<P>This confirms the Opinion of tho&s;e who argu'd from the Solidity of the Con&s;titution, that there could not be &s;o much ground for the publick Appre|hen&s;ions of the <HI>Pretender,</HI> as others al|ledged; the Laws having &s;o effectually fortify'd the <HI>Prote&s;tant Succe&s;&s;ion,</HI> as that
<PB N="63" REF="62">
no Man would be hardy enough, at the Demi&s;e of the Queen, to venture in Fa|vour of the <HI>Pretender,</HI> &s;o much as to move one Step. And &s;o it has proved.</P>
<P>As many will be angry at the Ju&s;tice done here to Lord <HI>John Bull,</HI> and, per|haps, be the willinger to have it be|lieved, that he was not in the <HI>Jacobite</HI> Intere&s;t: So, on the other Hand, &s;ome may be di&s;plea&s;ed that I &s;hould &s;ugge&s;t, that others were inclin'd to the <HI>Preten|der:</HI> But the Charge is not lay'd here &s;o as to accu&s;e one, or excu&s;e the other &s;o po&s;itively, but that if any one of them had, in Sea&s;on, openly declared them|&s;elves, our Secret Hi&s;tory &s;hould not have failed to done them Ju&s;tice in the &s;ame Manner; and altho' I cannot give the like Te&s;timony to them, yet I will not &s;ay, That they had really a De&s;ign again&s;t the Succe&s;&s;ion; if any one can prove it upon them, I &s;hall leave it to the Sequel to cen&s;ure or acquit them.</P>
<P>This la&s;t Scene ended all the Tran&s;|actions of the Cabal above-mention'd; and they never acted in a Body after|wards; and there al&s;o our Secret Hi&s;tory mu&s;t make another Stop. The <HI>Pur&s;e,</HI> tho' not fir&s;t in the Propo&s;al it &s;elf, yet as he came into it with Lord <HI>John Bull,</HI>
<PB N="64" REF="63">
&s;o he <HI>over-acted</HI> all his Contemporaries, endeavouring by an Officious Ha&s;te to anticipate tho&s;e, who from better Prin|ciples were far more &s;teady in the <HI>Han|nover</HI> Intere&s;t: And while Lord <HI>John,</HI> who, with an old <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Plaine&s;s, had declared him&s;elf from a true Foundation, in a blunt and direct Manner, was yet made the <HI>Butt</HI> for the Populace to &s;hoot Scandal at, and was run upon with the u&s;ual Rudene&s;s of the Party; the <HI>Pur&s;e</HI> Carrying him&s;elf with an Abject, Fawning Compliance, &s;eem'd to be in a fair Way of being receiv'd into Favour.</P>
<P>He went on in this Manner a great Way; nay, &s;ome &s;ay, he was not in the lea&s;t backward, when the &s;aid Lord <HI>John Bull</HI> was di&s;mi&s;s'd from his Office, but &s;eem'd to &s;atisfy him&s;elf with any one's Falling, while he flatter'd him&s;elf that he &s;hould Stand: But the Hypocri&s;y which carried him &s;o far, had not the Succe&s;s of Carrying him farther, as he had the Weakne&s;s to expect, and he fell unpity'd of every Side.</P>
<P>In the&s;e Con&s;ultations it was remarka|ble, that as the&s;e Men left the <HI>Jacobites,</HI> &s;o now the <HI>Jacobites</HI> left them, from whence the De&s;ign of <HI>Jacobiti&s;m</HI> in ge|neral may have this brief Ob&s;ervation
<PB N="65" REF="64">
made of it, <HI>viz.</HI> That all the Hopes the Parti&s;ans of that Cau&s;e ever &s;aw Rea&s;on to entertain, depended upon the Divi&s;i|ons, Factions, and Animo&s;ities, which they either found or created among the People of this Nation. It is evident, that upon the Acce&s;&s;ion of his pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty to the Crown, the very Name of <HI>Jaco|biti&s;m</HI> &s;inks in the Nation; the unani|mous Agreement of all Parties among the People, and their Satisfaction in the Per&s;on and Government of the King, drowns the very Thoughts of a <HI>Pre|tender;</HI> and that which was, a few Days pa&s;t, &s;o Formidable, and fill'd us with terrible Apprehen&s;ions, is not now &s;poken of but with Ridicule and Con|tempt. We are now no more alarum'd at the <HI>Pretender</HI>'s Neighbourhood, or the Power of the <HI>French</HI> King to put him upon the Nation; we do not mea|&s;ure the Di&s;tance of <HI>Bar-le-Duc</HI> from the Sea, or calculate how far he is removed from <HI>France;</HI> while we are unanimous in our Affection and Zeal for the Pub|lick, while we are united and re&s;ol|ved in the Intere&s;t of the <HI>Prote&s;tant</HI> Succe&s;&s;or, who we enjoy, we are out of all Danger; and I infer from thence, that to pre&s;erve the pre&s;ent Unanim ity,
<PB N="66" REF="65">
and prevent future Divi&s;ions among our People, is the only Way to pre|vent our being again in Danger of a <HI>Pretender.</HI></P>
<P>All this while the <HI>Staff</HI> had given him to give Thanks to Heaven, that he had drawn off from the&s;e Men in &s;o &s;ea&s;onable a Time, and &s;o open a Manner, that Impartial Men might have Room left, and Rea&s;on given them to &s;ee to who&s;e Account they ought to place the violent Things which had been Tran&s;acted in the Ad|mini&s;tration, not only after his Rece&s;s, but for a long Time. It is true, the <HI>Staff</HI> could not expect that the Party-Men, who found it convenient for their other De&s;igns, that, whether True or Fal&s;e, the <HI>Staff</HI> &s;hould be Cen&s;ur'd as guilty of all the&s;e Things. I &s;ay, the <HI>Staff</HI> could not expect that they would be &s;ilenced by the&s;e Incidents, however pungent; for it has not been the Cu&s;tom of the&s;e Men to cea&s;e a Charg$ with good Rea&s;ons, which was fir&s;$ rai&s;ed without. But as the Rea&s;o$ of unju&s;t Cen&s;ure is generally found|ed in a Re&s;olution to injure the Per&s;o$ on whom it is pa&s;&s;ed, whether Righ$ or Wrong, &s;o neither will tho&s;e wh$
<PB N="67" REF="66">
pa&s;s tho&s;e Cen&s;ures be &s;atisfy'd with the mo&s;t clear Vindication. It is not therefore for the &s;ake of &s;uch Men, that this Secret Hi&s;tory is &s;o particular in this Part, but for the &s;ake of tho&s;e who are willing to be rightly inform'd of Things, and to pa&s;s their Judgment according to Evidence, not according to Prejudices, and the Intere&s;t of the Par|ties.</P>
<P>The <HI>Staff,</HI> I &s;ay, having acted as is before Noted, and parted from the&s;e Men, now &s;aw the Advantage of it, and had great Rea&s;on to be thankful that it had been &s;o, and had Lord <HI>Bull</HI> drawn out at the &s;ame time, it had done more to clear up his Character to the World, as to the&s;e Things, than all was able to do afterwards: But it was his Misfortune not to &s;ee in to the People he was engag'd with till afterwards.</P>
<P>Nor can the Enemies of the <HI>Staff,</HI> bring the lea&s;t Cavil again&s;t the Sin|cerity of the Parting with tho&s;e People, or charge him with any de&s;ign in it, as they would very fain do, unle&s;s they would make us believe the <HI>Staff</HI> had the <HI>Second Sight,</HI> and knew of the Queen's Death, which I have rea&s;on to &s;ay, was a perfect Surprize, not only
<PB N="68" REF="67">
to the whole Court, but even to her Maje&s;ty her &s;elf; the Queen not hav|ing been in a better State of Health for &s;ome Years, than &s;he had been in for &s;ome Weeks, before the &s;urprizing Di&s;|temper which carry'd her off, in which the whole Court will bear Witne&s;s to the Truth of this Hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>Again, it is evident not only the <HI>Staff,</HI> but the Queen her &s;elf had begun to take &s;ome Mea&s;ures, as was mention'd in the former part of this Hi&s;tory, for the overthrow of the New Faction, and for &s;uch a Management of Affairs, as would have made the whole King|dom perfectly ea&s;y, have &s;ecured the Intere&s;t of the Hou&s;e of <HI>Hanover,</HI> to their own full Satisfaction, and have entirely remov'd all the Nations feares, either of <HI>France</HI> or of the <HI>Pretender;</HI> and had not Things been carry'd here by Methods, and with Hands that are not at pre&s;ent proper for this Hi&s;tory to &s;peak off, I &s;hould have entred far|ther into this part, and have laid down the Schemes of the New Admini&s;tration which her late Maje&s;ty had re&s;olv'd on, and which the <HI>Staff</HI> would have effected in a &s;hort time, which when a Con|venient time &s;hall be found, will &s;ur|prize
<PB N="69" REF="68">
the World and alter their thoughts, not of the <HI>Staff</HI> only, but of the Ge|neral Management of things during all that Admini&s;tration; and above all, would make tho&s;e People a little a &s;hamed of them&s;elves, who have given &s;uch Characters of her late Maje&s;ty, as if &s;he was uncapable of Acting any thing of her &s;elf, or of Judging of the Affairs of her Government, but ju&s;t as &s;he was led by tho&s;e in who&s;e Hands &s;he had been pleas'd to place the Ad|mini&s;tration.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be acknowledg'd, that altho' when her Maja&s;ty had entru&s;ted the Admini&s;tration in &s;uch Hands as &s;he thought capable to Manage the &s;ame, &s;he was as willing to Confide entirely in their Fidelity and Vigilance, as a Wife Prince ought to be, who had &s;een no rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect the Ability or In|tegrety of her Servants; yet they will neither do Ju&s;tice to her Maje&s;ty, or to her Mini&s;try, who do not acknow|ledge that the la&s;t Mini&s;try endeavour'd more than any Mini&s;try that went be|fore them, to have her Maje&s;ty take Cognizance of her own Affairs, and to Act with a free Agency, doing nothing of Moment, without her Maje&s;ty's having
<PB N="70" REF="69">
fir&s;t been faithfully told the Circum|&s;tances of the Thing, and been left to Act therein, without Importunities or Un&s;ea&s;onable Pre&s;&s;ings, as had been the Ca&s;e in former times.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who would do Ju&s;tice to her Maje&s;ties Memory, cannot do le&s;s than acknowledge this, and that the Autho|rity in Acting, and particular Cogni|zance of Things before they were acted, was never &s;o entirely given up to the Mini&s;try as has been pretended; of which a further account may in due time be given to the World.</P>
<P>If any are offended at this brief, but Impartial Hi&s;tory of Secret Things, they mu&s;t be at the &s;ame liberty to Write again&s;t it, that I have taken to Write it; what has been yet done that way, has appeared &s;o Weak, and &s;o Mali|cious, that I &s;ee no rea&s;on to &s;ay one word in Replication: Nothing has been offered to refute this Secret Hi&s;tory, or to oppo&s;e the Matters of Fact as related; as to the Glo&s;s put upon them by Party-Men, it is nothing to the Hi&s;tory; my Bu&s;ine&s;s is to relate, not to di&s;pute; if what is contain'd in this Secret Hi&s;tory is not True, no doubt we &s;hall hear of it in Publick;</P>
