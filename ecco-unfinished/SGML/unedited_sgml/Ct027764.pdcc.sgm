<LG>
<L>WHILE you, dear TOWNSHEND, o'er the billows ride,</L>
<L>MULGRAVE in front, and HANGER by thy &s;ide,</L>
<L>Met it delights the woods and wilds to court,</L>
<L>For ru&s;tic feats and unambitious &s;port.&mdash;</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>At that dim hour when fading lamps expire,</L>
<MILESTONE N="5">
<L>When the la&s;t, ling'ring, clubs to bed retire,</L>
<PB N="6" REF="4">
<L>I ri&s;e!&mdash;how &s;hould I then thy feelings &s;hock,</L>
<L>Un&s;hav'd, unpowder'd, in my &s;hooting frock!</L>
<L>What frock? thou crie&s;t&mdash;I'll tell thee&mdash;the old brown;</L>
<L>Trimm'd to a jacket, with the &s;kirts cut down&mdash;</L>
<MILESTONE N="10">
<L>Thou laugh'&s;t; I know, thou do'&s;t; but check that &s;neer;</L>
<L>What tho' no fa&s;hion'd &s;port&s;man I appear,</L>
<L>Yet hence thy CHARLES'S voice gains &s;hriller force;</L>
<L>Ah! JACK, if DUNNING &s;hot, he'd not be hoar&s;e.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Nor deem ev'n here the cares of &s;tate forgot,</L>
<MILESTONE N="15">
<L>I wad with gazettes ev'ry &s;econd &s;hot:</L>
<L>ALMON'S bold &s;heets the intervals &s;upply;</L>
<L>And &s;till, methinks, his charges farthe&s;t fly.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Oft too, while all around my pointers &s;tray,</L>
<L>With patriot names I cheer them on their way:</L>
<MILESTONE N="20">
<L>No &s;ervile mini&s;terial runners they!</L>
<PB N="7" REF="5">
<L>Not RANGER then, but WASHINGTON, I cry;</L>
<L>Hey on! PAUL JONES, re-echoes to the &s;ky:</L>
<L>Toho! old FRANKLIN&mdash;SILAS DEANE, take heed!&mdash;</L>
<L>Cheer'd with the &s;ound, o'er hills and dales they &s;peed:</L>
<MILESTONE N="25">
<L>Till one, to who&s;e quick &s;en&s;e and practis'd skill</L>
<L>His active followers yield a ha&s;ty will,</L>
<L>Touch'd by the &s;cent the pa&s;&s;ing gales convey,</L>
<L>With &s;tartled vigilance pre&s;umes the prey:</L>
<L>The re&s;t a di&s;ciplin'd &s;ub&s;ervience keep;</L>
<MILESTONE N="30">
<L>Da&s;h where he runs, and as he crouches, creep:</L>
<L>At length the ho&s;tile league one point avow:</L>
<L>Now places, places! order, order, now!</L>
<L>"BUNB'RY! let me (I cry) for party's &s;ake,</L>
<L>"Teach thee where be&s;t to aim, what ground to take."</L>
<MILESTONE N="35">
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And &s;ee, a young bird ri&s;es, weak and &s;low;</L>
<L>"At him, Sir CHARLES!"&mdash;He fires, and lays him low&mdash;</L>
<PB N="8" REF="6">
<L>Scar'd at the &s;ound, up the full covey &s;prings;</L>
<L>RICHARD at random fires, and only <HI>wings:</HI></L>
<L>Not &s;o thy CHARLES; intent with half-clos'd &s;ight,</L>
<MILESTONE N="40">
<L>Cautious I watch their veteran leader's flight:</L>
<L>At him I aim, the covey's head and guide;</L>
<L>I fire; but ah! too plainly on one &s;ide:</L>
<L>Again I try, like <HI>ri&s;ing to explain,</HI></L>
<L>A double barrel's force, but try in vain;</L>
<MILESTONE N="45">
<L>Again&s;t my&s;elf the heated tube recoils,</L>
<L>Nor gains one feather to requite my toils.&mdash;</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But if too &s;oon the &s;tartled covey ri&s;e,</L>
<L>And move a <HI>previous que&s;tion</HI> in the &s;kies,</L>
<L>My faithful groom quick marks them as they &s;pring,</L>
<MILESTONE N="50">
<L>And counts their no&s;es, undeceiv'd as BYNG:</L>
<L>Whether in clo&s;e array, and nemine con,</L>
<L>To their old beaten ground the covey's gone;</L>
<PB N="9" REF="7">
<L>Or, &s;cattering wild, in petty parties fall,</L>
<L>Some to <HI>pair off,</HI> and &s;ome to wait a <HI>call.</HI></L>
<MILESTONE N="55">
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus from each kindred image, fancy draws</L>
<L>The latent emblem of a nobler cau&s;e.</L>
<L>If chance, a &s;tray, lone, bird my cour&s;e invites,</L>
<L>I think of MEREDITH, and pro&s;elytes;</L>
<L>Mean, mangled, game not for it&s;elf I prize;</L>
<MILESTONE N="60">
<L>Vengeance and PALLISER to memory ri&s;e.&mdash;</L>
<L>Some &s;enatorial type ev'n Pointers yield;</L>
<L>One loves too narrow, one to wide a field;</L>
<L>This creeps below, that &s;prings above his work,</L>
<L>As HARTLEY &s;low, or uncontroll'd as BURKE.</L>
<MILESTONE N="65">
<L>With rav'nous ardour &s;ome devour the prey;</L>
<L>O gentle SAWBRIDGE, la&s;h &s;uch fiends away!</L>
<L>Others, with puzzling zeal, &s;mall objects mark;</L>
<L>Judicious LUTTRELL, bid them <HI>ware a lark!</HI>&mdash;</L>
</LG>
<PB N="10" REF="8">
<LG>
<L>But come, dear JACK, all martial as thou art,</L>
<MILESTONE N="70">
<L>With &s;pruce cockade, heroically &s;mart,</L>
<L>Come, and once more together let us greet</L>
<L>The long lo&s;t plea&s;ures of ST. JAMES'S STREET.</L>
<L>Enough o'er &s;tubbles have I deign'd to tread;</L>
<L>Too long wer't thou at anchor, at SPITHEAD!</L>
<MILESTONE N="75">
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Come, happy friend! to hail thy wi&s;h'd return,</L>
<L>Nor vulgar fire, nor venal light &s;hall burn,</L>
<L>From gentle bo&s;oms purer flames &s;hall ri&s;e,</L>
<L>And keener ardours fla&s;h from Beauty's eyes.</L>
<L>Methinks, I &s;ee thee now re&s;ume thy &s;tand,</L>
<MILESTONE N="80">
<L>Pride of Fop-alley, tho' a little tann'd:</L>
<L>What tender joy the gazing Nymphs di&s;clo&s;ed!</L>
<L>How pine with envy the neglected Beaux!</L>
<L>While many a feeble frown and &s;truggling &s;mile</L>
<L>Fondly reprove thy too adventurous toil,</L>
<MILESTONE N="85">
<PB N="11" REF="9">
<L>And &s;eem with reprehen&s;ive love to &s;ay,</L>
<L>"Dear Mr. TOWNSHEND, wherefore did&s;t thou &s;tray!</L>
<L>"What fatal havoc might one &s;hot have made,</L>
<L>"If not thy life, thy leg the forfeit paid!</L>
<L>"That &s;hot thy foretop might have made it's prey,</L>
<MILESTONE N="90">
<L>"Or &s;ing'd one dear devoted curl away;</L>
<L>"Or lopp'd that hand, the pride of love and lace;</L>
<L>"Or &s;carr'd, with bolder &s;acrilege, thy face."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Soon as to BROOKS'S thence thy foot&s;teps bend,</L>
<L>What gratulations thy approach attend!</L>
<MILESTONE N="95">
<L>See GIBBON rap his box; au&s;picious &s;ign;</L>
<L>That cla&s;&s;ic compliment and wit combine;</L>
<L>See BEAUCLERK'S cheek a tinge of red &s;urpri&s;e,</L>
<L>And Friend&s;hip give what cruel Health denies.</L>
<L>Important TOWNSHEND! what can thee with&s;tand?</L>
<MILESTONE N="100">
<L>The ling'ring black-ball lags in BOOTHBY'S hand;</L>
<PB N="12" REF="10" MS="Y">
<L>Ev'n DRAPIER checks the &s;entimental &s;igh,</L>
<L>And SMITH, without an oath, &s;u&s;pends the dye.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>That night, to fe&s;tive wit and friend&s;hip due,</L>
<L>That night thy CHARLES'S board &s;hall welcome you.</L>
<MILESTONE N="105">
<L>Sallads, that &s;hame ragouts, &s;hall woo thy ta&s;te;</L>
<L>Deep &s;halt thou delve in WELTJE'S motley pa&s;te;</L>
<L>D$RBY &s;hall lend, if not his plate, his Cooks,</L>
<L>And, know, I've bought the be&s;t Champaigne from BROOKS;</L>
<L>From liberal BROOKS, who&s;e &s;peculative skill,</L>
<MILESTONE N="110">
<L>Is ha&s;ty credit, and a di&s;tant bill;</L>
<L>Who, nurs'd in clubs, di&s;dains a vulgar trade,</L>
<L>Exults to tru&s;t, and blu&s;hes to be paid!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>On that au&s;picious night, &s;upremely grac'd</L>

<MILESTONE N="115">
<PB N="13" REF="11">
<L>Not in contentious heat, nor mad'ning &s;trife,</L>
<L>Not with the bu&s;y ills, nor cares of life,</L>
