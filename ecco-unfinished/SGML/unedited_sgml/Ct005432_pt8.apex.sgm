<P>WHatever &s;tudies on the one hand, or amu&s;ements on the other, it &s;hall be my fortune to fall into, I &s;hall be equally incapable of forgetting you in any of them. The ta&s;k I undertook <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">The Tran&s;lation of Ho|mer's Iliad. <BIBL>P.</BIBL></NOTE>, though of weight enough in it&s;elf, has had a voluntary increa&s;e by the inlarging my de&s;ign of the <HI>Notes</HI> <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">The notes on the Iliad were his own: Tho&s;e on the Ody&s;&s;ey were Dr. Broome's.&mdash;But they &s;peak their re|&s;pective Authors.</NOTE>; and the nece&s;&s;ity of con&s;ulting a num|ber
<PB N="4" REF="14">
of books has carry'd me to Oxford: but, I fear, thro' my Lord Harcourt's and Dr. Clarke's means, I &s;hall be more conver&s;ant with the plea&s;ures and company of the place, than with the books and manu&s;cripts of it.</P>
<P>I find &s;till more rea&s;on to complain of the negligence of the Geographers in their Maps of old Greece, &s;ince I look'd upon two or three more noted names in the public libraries here. But with all the care I am capable of, I have &s;ome cau&s;e to fear the engraver will prejudice me in a few &s;ituations. I have been forced to write to him in &s;o high a &s;tyle, that, were my epi&s;tle inter|cepted, it would rai&s;e no &s;mall admiration in an ordinary man. There is &s;carce an order in it of le&s;s importance, than to remove &s;uch and &s;uch mountains, alter the cour&s;e of &s;uch and &s;uch rivers, place a large city on &s;uch a coa&s;t, and raze another in another country. I have &s;et bounds to the &s;ea, and &s;aid to the land, Thus far &s;halt thou advance, and no further <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">This relates to the Map of ancient Greece, laid down by our Author in his ob&s;er|vations on the &s;econd Iliad. <BIBL>P.</BIBL></NOTE>. In the mean time, I, who talk and command at this rate, am in danger of lo&s;ing my hor&s;e, and &s;tand in &s;ome fear of a country Ju&s;tice <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Some of the Laws were, at this time, put in force a|gain&s;t the Papi&s;ts.</NOTE>. To di&s;arm me indeed may be but prudential, con|&s;idering
<PB N="5" REF="15">
what Armies I have at pre&s;ent on foot, and in my &s;ervice; a hundred thou&s;and Gre|cians are no contemptible body; for all that I can tell, they may be as formidable as four thou|&s;and Prie&s;ts; and they &s;eem proper forces to &s;end again&s;t tho&s;e in Barcelona. That &s;iege de|&s;erves as fine a poem as the Iliad, and the ma|chining part of poetry would be the ju&s;ter in it, as, they &s;ay, the inhabitants expect Angels from heaven to their a&s;&s;i&s;tance. May I venture to &s;ay who am a Papi&s;t, and &s;ay to you who are a Papi&s;t, that nothing is more a&s;toni&s;hing to me, than that people &s;o greatly warm'd with a &s;en&s;e of Liberty, &s;hould be capable of har|bouring &s;uch weak &s;uper&s;tition <NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Were not the old Ro|mans as <HI>warm'd</HI> and as <HI>weak?</HI> And could a man, inflamed with the love of civil Liberty, which he &s;ees falling a prey to Tyranny, imagine a cau&s;e more worthy the interpo&s;i|tion of Heaven?</NOTE>, and that &s;o much bravery and &s;o much folly can inhabit the &s;ame brea&s;ts?</P>
<P>I could not but take a trip to London on the death of the Queen, mov'd by the common curio&s;ity of mankind, who leave their own bu|&s;ine&s;s to be looking upon other mens. I thank God, that, as for my&s;elf, I am below all the ac|cidents of &s;tate-changes by my circum&s;tances, and above them by my philo&s;ophy. Common charity of man to man, and univer&s;al good-will
<PB N="6" REF="16">
to all, are the points I have mo&s;t at heart; and, I am &s;ure, tho&s;e are not to be broken for the &s;ake of any governors, or government. I am willing to hope the be&s;t, and what I more wi&s;h than my own or any particular man's advance|ment, is, that this turn may put an end entire|ly to the divi&s;ions of Whig and Tory; that the parties may love each other as well as I love them both, or at lea&s;t hurt each other as little as I would either: and that our own people may live as quietly as we &s;hall certainly let theirs; that is to &s;ay, that want of power it&s;elf in us may not be a &s;urer prevention of harm, than want of will in them. I am &s;ure, if all Whigs and all Tories had the &s;pirit of one Ro|man Catholic that I know, it would be well for all Roman Catholics; and if all Roman Catholics had always had that &s;pirit, it had been well for all others; and we had never been charged with &s;o wicked a &s;pirit as that of Per|&s;ecution.</P>
<P>I agree with you in my &s;entiments of the &s;tate of our nation &s;ince this change: I find my&s;elf ju&s;t in the &s;ame &s;ituation of mind you de&s;cribe as your own, heartily wi&s;hing the good, that is, the quiet of my Country, and hoping a total end of all the unhappy divi&s;ions of man|kind by party-&s;pirit, which at be&s;t is but the madne&s;s of many for the gain of a few.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER II.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">From Mr. BLOUNT.</HEAD>
<P>IT is with a great deal of plea&s;ure I &s;ee your letter, dear Sir, written in a &s;tyle that &s;hews you full of health, and in the mid&s;t of diver|&s;ions: I think tho&s;e two things nece&s;&s;ary to a man who has &s;uch undertakings in hand as Yours. All lovers of Homer are indebted to you for taking &s;o much pains about the &s;itua|tion of his Heroes' kingdoms; it will not only be of great u&s;e with regard to his works, but to all that read any of the Greek hi&s;torians; who generally are ill under&s;tood thro' the dif|ference of the maps as to the places they treat of, which makes one think one author con|tradicts another. You are going to &s;et us right; and 'tis an advantage every body will gladly &s;ee you engro&s;s the glory of.</P>
<P>You can draw rules to be free and ea&s;y, from formal pedants; and teach men to be &s;hort and pertinent, from tedious commentators. How|ever, I congratulate your happy deliverance from &s;uch authors, as you (with all your hu|manity) cannot wi&s;h alive again to conver&s;e with. Critics will quarrel with you, if you dare to plea&s;e without their leave; and Zealots will &s;hrug up their &s;houlders at a man, that pre|tends
<PB N="8" REF="18">
to get to Heaven out of their form, dre&s;s, and diet. I would no more make a judgment of an author's genius from a damning critic, than I would of a man's religion from an un|&s;aving zealot.</P>
<P>I could take great delight in affording you the new glory of making a Barceloniad (if I may venture to coin &s;uch a word:) I fancy you would find a ju&s;ter parallel than it &s;eems at fir&s;t &s;ight; for the Trojans too had a great mixture of folly with their bravery; and I am out of countenance for them when I read the wi&s;e re|&s;ult of their council, where, after a warm de|bate between Antenor and Paris about re&s;toring Helen, Priam &s;agely determines that they &s;hall go to &s;upper. And as for the Greeks, what can equal their &s;uper&s;tition in &s;acrificing an in|nocent lady?</P>
<Q><L>Tantum Relligio potuit, &amp;c.</L></Q>
<P>I have a good opinion of my politics, &s;ince they agree with a man who always thinks &s;o ju&s;tly as you. I wi&s;h it were in our power to per&s;uade all the nation into as calm and &s;teddy a di&s;po&s;ition of mind.</P>
<P>We have receiv'd the late melancholy news, with the u&s;ual ceremony, of condoling in one breath for the lo&s;s of a gracious Queen, and in another rejoicing for an illu&s;trious King. My
<PB N="9" REF="19">
views carry me no farther, than to wi&s;h the peace and welfare of my Country; and my mo|rals and politics teach me to leave all that to be adju&s;ted by our repre&s;entatives above, and to divine providence. It is much at one to you and me, who &s;it at the helm, provided they will permit us to &s;ail quietly in the great &s;hip. Ambition is a vice that is timely morti|fy'd in us poor Papi&s;ts; we ought in recom|pence to cultivate as many virtues in our&s;elves as we can, that we may be truly great. Among my Ambitions, that of being a &s;incere friend is one of the chief: yet I will confe&s;s that I have a &s;ecret plea&s;ure to have &s;ome of my de&s;cend|ants know, that their Ance&s;tor was great with Mr. Pope.</P>

<P>IT is an agreement of long date between you and me, that you &s;hould do with my letters ju&s;t as you plea&s;ed, and an&s;wer them at your lei&s;ure; and that is as &s;oon as I &s;hall think you ought. I have &s;o true a ta&s;te of the &s;ub&s;tantial
<PB N="10" REF="20">
part of your friend&s;hip, that I wave all cere|monials; and am &s;ure to make you as many vi&s;its as I can, and leave you to return them whenever you plea&s;e, a&s;&s;uring you they &s;hall at all times be heartily welcome to me.</P>
<P>The many alarms we have from your parts, have no effect upon the genius that reigns in our country, which is happily turn'd to pre&s;erve peace and quiet, among us. What a di&s;mal &s;cene has there been opened in the North? what ruin have tho&s;e unfortunate ra&s;h gentle|men drawn upon them&s;elves and their mi&s;era|ble followers, and perchance upon many others too, who upon no account would be their followers? However, it may look ungenerous to reproach people in di&s;tre&s;s. I don't remem|ber you and I ever u&s;ed to trouble our&s;elves about politics, but when any matter hap|pened to fall into our di&s;cour&s;e, we us'd to condemn all undertakings that tended towards the di&s;turbing the peace and quiet of our Coun|try, as contrary to the notions we had of mo|rality and religion, which oblige us on no pre|tence what&s;oever to violate the laws of cha|rity. How many lives have there been lo&s;t in hot blood, and how many more are there like to be taken off in cold?

<P>'Tis a great many years &s;ince I fell in love with the character of Pomponius Atticus: I long'd to imitate him a little, and have con|triv'd hitherto, to be, like him, engaged in no party, but to be a faithful friend to &s;ome in both: I find my&s;elf very well in this way hi|therto, and live in a certain peace of mind by it, which, I am per&s;uaded, brings a man more content than all the perqui&s;ites of wild ambi|tion.

<P>I Know of nothing that will be &s;o intere&s;ting to you at pre&s;ent, as &s;ome circum&s;tances of the la&s;t act of that eminent comic poet, and
<PB N="12" REF="22">
our friend, Wycherley. He had often told me, as I doubt not he did all his acquaintance, that he would marry as &s;oon as his life was de&s;pair'd of: Accordingly a few days before his death he underwent the ceremony; and join'd toge|ther tho&s;e two &s;acraments which, wi&s;e men &s;ay, &s;hould be the la&s;t we receive; for, if you ob|&s;erve, Matrimony is placed after Extreme unc|tion in our Catechi&s;m, as a kind of hint of the order of time in which they are to be taken. The old man then lay down, &s;atisfy'd in the con&s;cience of having by this one act paid his ju&s;t debts, obliged a woman, who (he was told) had merit, and &s;hewn an heroic re&s;entment of the ill u&s;age of his next heir. Some hundred pounds which he had with the Lady, di&s;charg|ed tho&s;e debts; a jointure of four hundred a year made her a recompence; and the nephew he left to comfort him&s;elf as well as he could, with the mi&s;erable remains of a mortgaged e&s;tate. I &s;aw our friend twice after this was done, le&s;s peevi&s;h in his &s;ickne&s;s than he u&s;ed to be in his health; neither much afraid of dying, nor (which in him had been more like|ly) much a&s;hamed of marrying. The even|ing before he expired, he called his young wife to the bed&s;ide, and earne&s;tly entreated her not to deny him one reque&s;t, the la&s;t he &s;hould make. Upon her a&s;&s;urances of con&s;enting to
<PB N="13" REF="23">
it, he told her, <Q>&startq;My dear, it is only this, that you will never marry an old man again.&endq;</Q> I cannot help remarking, that &s;ickne&s;s, which of|ten de&s;troys both wit and wi&s;dom, yet &s;eldom has power to remove that talent which we call humour: Mr. Wycherley &s;hew'd his, even in this la&s;t compliment; tho' I think his reque&s;t a little hard, for why &s;hould he bar her from doubling her Jointure on the &s;ame ea&s;y terms?</P>
<P>So trivial as the&s;e circum&s;tances are, I &s;hould not be di&s;pleas'd my&s;elf to know &s;uch trifles, when they concern or characteri&s;e any eminent per&s;on. The wi&s;e&s;t and wittie&s;t of men are &s;eldom wi&s;er or wittier than others in the&s;e &s;o|ber moments: At lea&s;t, our friend ended much in the character he had lived in: and Horace's rule for a play, may as well be apply'd to him as a play-wright,</P>

<P>I Am ju&s;t return'd from the country, whither Mr. Rowe accompanied me, and pa&s;s'd a week in the fore&s;t. I need not tell you how
<PB N="14" REF="24">
much a man of his turn entertain'd me; but I mu&s;t acquaint you there is a vivacity and gaie|ty of di&s;po&s;ition almo&s;t peculiar to him, which make it impo&s;&s;ible to part from him without that unea&s;ine&s;s which generally &s;ucceeds all our plea&s;ures. I have been ju&s;t taking a &s;olitary walk by moon-&s;hine, full of reflections on the tran&s;itory nature of all human delights; and giving my thoughts a loo&s;e in the contempla|tion of tho&s;e &s;atisfactions which probably we may hereafter ta&s;te in the company of &s;eparate &s;pirits, when we &s;hall range the walks above, and perhaps gaze on this world at as va&s;t a di|&s;tance as we now do on tho&s;e worlds. The plea&s;ures we are to enjoy in that conver&s;ation mu&s;t undoubtedly be of a nobler kind, and (not unlikely) may proceed from the di&s;coveries each &s;hall communicate to another, of God and of Nature; for the happine&s;s of minds can &s;urely be nothing but knowledge.</P>
<P>The highe&s;t gratification we receive here from company is Mirth, which at the be&s;t is but a fluttering unquiet motion, that beats about the brea&s;t for a few moments, and after leaves it void and empty. Keeping good company, even the be&s;t, is but a le&s;s &s;hameful art of lo&s;|ing time. What we here call &s;cience and &s;tu|dy, are little better: the greater number of arts to which we apply our&s;elves are mere groping
<PB N="15" REF="25">
in the dark; and even the &s;earch of our mo&s;t important concerns in a future being, is but a needle&s;s, anxious, and uncertain ha&s;te to be knowing, &s;ooner than we can, what without all this &s;olicitude we &s;hall know a little later. We are but curious impertinents in the ca&s;e of futurity. 'Tis not our bu&s;ine&s;s to be gue&s;&s;ing what the &s;tate of &s;ouls &s;hall be, but to be doing what may make our own &s;tate happy; we can|not be knowing, but we can be virtuous.</P>
<P>If this be my notion of a great part of that high &s;cience, Divinity, you will be &s;o civil as to imagine I lay no mighty &s;tre&s;s upon the re&s;t. Even of my darling poetry I really make no o|ther u&s;e, than hor&s;es of the bells that gingle about their ears (tho' now and then they to&s;s their heads as if they were proud of them) on|ly to jog on, a little more merrily.</P>
<P>Your ob&s;ervations on the narrow conceptions of mankind in the point of Friend&s;hip, confirm me in what I was &s;o fortunate as at my fir&s;t knowledge of you to hope, and &s;ince &s;o amply to experience. Let me take &s;o much decent pride and dignity upon me, as to tell you, that but for opinions like the&s;e which I di&s;cover'd in your mind, I had never made the trial I have done; which has &s;ucceeded &s;o much to mine, and, I believe, not le&s;s to your &s;atisfaction: for, if I know you right, your plea&s;ure is greater
<PB N="16" REF="26">
in obliging me, than I can feel on my part, till it falls in my power to oblige you.</P>
<P>Your remark, that the variety of opinions in politics or religion is often rather a gratification, than an objection, to people who have &s;en&s;e enough to con&s;ider the beautiful order of nature in her variations; makes me think you have not con&s;trued Joannes Secundus wrong, in the ver&s;e which precedes that which you quote: <HI>Bene nota Fides,</HI> as I take it, does no way &s;ig|nify the Roman Catholic Religion, tho' Se|cundus was of it. I think it was a generous thought, and one that flow'd from an exalted mind, That it was not improbable but God might be delighted with the various methods of wor&s;hiping him, which divided the whole world <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">This was an opinion taken up by the old Philo|&s;ophers, as the la&s;t &s;upport of Pagani&s;m again&s;t Chri&s;ti|anity: And the Mi&s;&s;ionaries, to both the Indies, tell us, it is the fir&s;t an&s;wer modern barbarians give to the offer made them of the Go&s;pel. But Chri&s;tians might &s;ee that the notion is not only <HI>impro|bable,</HI> but impo&s;&s;ible to be true, if the redemption of mankind was purcha&s;ed by the death of Je&s;us, which is the go&s;pel idea of his Reli|gion. Nor is there any need of this opinion to di&s;credit per&s;ecution. For the iniquity of that practice does not a|ri&s;e from re&s;training what God permits or delights in, but from u&s;urping a juri&s;dic|tion over con&s;cience, which belongs only to his tribu|nal.</NOTE>.

<P>I Find that a real concern is not only a hin|drance to &s;peaking, but to writing too: the more time we give our&s;elves to think over one's own or a friend's unhappine&s;s, the more un|able we grow to expre&s;s the grief that proceeds from it. It is as natural to delay a letter, at &s;uch a &s;ea&s;on as this, as to retard a melancholy vi&s;it to a per&s;on one cannot relieve. One is a&s;hamed in that circum&s;tance, to pretend to entertain people with trifling, in&s;ignificant af|fectations of &s;orrow on the one hand, or un|&s;ea&s;onable and forced gaieties on the other. 'Tis a kind of profanation of things &s;acred, to treat &s;o &s;olemn a matter as a generous vo|luntary &s;uffering, with compliments, or he|roic gallantries. Such a mind as your's has no need of being &s;pirited up into honour, or like
<PB N="18" REF="28">
a weak woman, prai&s;ed into an opinion of its own virtue. 'Tis enough to do and &s;uffer what we ought; and men &s;hould know, that the noble power of &s;uffering bravely is as far above that of enterprizing greatly, as an unble|mi&s;h'd con&s;cience and inflexible re&s;olution are above an accidental flow of &s;pirits, or a &s;udden tide of blood. If the whole religious bu&s;ine&s;s of mankind be included in re&s;ignation to our Maker, and charity to our fellow creatures, there are now &s;ome people who give us as good an opportunity of practi&s;ing the one, as them|&s;elves have given an in&s;tance of the violation of the other. Whoever is really brave, has al|ways this comfort when he is oppre&s;s'd, that he knows him&s;elf to be &s;uperior to tho&s;e who in|jure him: for the greate&s;t power on earth can no &s;ooner do him that injury, but the brave man can make him&s;elf greater by forgiving it.</P>
<P>If it were generous to &s;eek for alleviating con|&s;olations in a calamity of &s;o much glory, one might &s;ay, that to be ruin'd thus in the gro&s;s, with a whole people, is but like peri&s;hing in the general conflagration, where nothing we can value is left behind us.</P>
<P>Methinks, the mo&s;t heroic thing we are left capable of doing, is to endeavour to lighten each other's load, and (oppre&s;s'd as we are) to &s;uccour &s;uch as are yet more oppre&s;s'd. If there
<PB N="19" REF="29">
are too many who cannot be a&s;&s;i&s;ted but by what we cannot give, our money; there are yet others who may be relieved by our coun&s;el, by our countenance, and even by our chearfulne&s;s. The misfortunes of private families, the mi&s;un|der&s;tandings of people whom di&s;tre&s;&s;es make &s;u&s;picious, the coldne&s;&s;es of relations whom change of religion may di&s;unite, or the nece&s;&s;i|ties of half-ruin'd e&s;tates render unkind to each other; the&s;e at lea&s;t may be &s;oftened in &s;ome degree, by a general well-managed humanity among our&s;elves; if all tho&s;e who have your principles of belief, had al&s;o your &s;en&s;e and conduct. But indeed mo&s;t of them have given lamentable proofs of the contrary; and 'tis to be apprehended that they who want &s;en&s;e, are only religious through weakne&s;s, and good-na|tured thro' &s;hame. The&s;e are narrow-minded creatures that never deal in e&s;&s;entials, their faith never looks beyond ceremonials, nor their cha|rity beyond relations. As poor as I am, I would gladly relieve any di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, con&s;cien|tious French refugee at this in&s;tant: what mu&s;t my concern then be, when I perceive &s;o many anxieties now tearing tho&s;e hearts, which I have de&s;ired a place in, and clouds of melancholy ri&s;ing on tho&s;e faces, which I have long look'd upon with affection? I begin already to feel both what &s;ome apprehend, and what others
<PB N="20" REF="30">
are yet too &s;tupid to apprehend. I grieve with the old, for &s;o many additional inconveniencies and chagrins, more than their &s;mall remain of life &s;eemed de&s;tined to undergo; and with the young, for &s;o many of tho&s;e gaieties and plea|&s;ures (the portion of youth) which they will by this means be deprived of. This brings in|to my mind one or other of tho&s;e I love be&s;t, and among them the widow and fatherle&s;s, late of&mdash;. As I am certain no people living had an earlier and truer &s;en&s;e of others misfortunes, or a more generous re&s;ignation as to what might be their own, &s;o I earne&s;tly wi&s;h that whatever part they mu&s;t bear, may be render'd as &s;up|portable to them, as it is in the power of any friend to make it.</P>
<P>But I know you have prevented me in this thought, as you always will in any thing that is good, or generous: I find by a letter of your lady's (which I have &s;een) that their ea&s;e and tranquillity is part of your care. I believe there's &s;ome fatality in it, that you &s;hould always, from time to time, be doing tho&s;e particular things that make me enamour'd of you.</P>
<P>I write this from Wind&s;or-Fore&s;t, of which I am come to take my la&s;t look. We here bid our neighbours adieu, much as tho&s;e who go to be hang'd do their fellow-pri&s;oners, who are condemn'd to follow them a few weeks af|ter.

<P>Tho' the change of my &s;cene of life, from Wind&s;or-fore&s;t to the &s;ide of the Thames, be one of the grand Aera's of my days, and may be called a notable period in &s;o incon&s;iderable a hi&s;tory; yet you can &s;carce imagine any hero pa&s;&s;ing from one &s;tage of life to another, with &s;o much tranquillity, &s;o ea&s;y a tran&s;ition, and &s;o laudable a behaviour. I am become &s;o tru|ly a citizen of the world (according to Plato's expre&s;&s;ion) that I look with equal indifference on what I have left, and on what I have gain|ed. The times and amu&s;ements pa&s;t are not more like a dream to me, than tho&s;e which are pre&s;ent: I lie in a refre&s;hing kind of inac|tion, and have one comfort at lea&s;t from ob|&s;curity, that the darkne&s;s helps me to &s;leep the better.

<P>I have very lately read Jeffery of Monmouth (to whom your Cornwall is not a little be|holden) in the tran&s;lation of a clergyman in my neighbourhood.

<P>THE que&s;tion you propo&s;ed to me is what at pre&s;ent I am the mo&s;t unfit man in the world to an&s;wer, by my lo&s;s of one of the be&s;t of Fathers.</P>
<P>He had lived in &s;uch a cour&s;e of Temper|ance as was enough to make the longe&s;t life a|greeable to him, and in &s;uch a cour&s;e of Piety as &s;ufficed to make the mo&s;t &s;udden death &s;o al&s;o. Sudden indeed it was: however, I hear|tily beg of God to give me &s;uch an one, pro|vided I can lead &s;uch a life. I leave him to the mercy of God, and to the piety of a religion that extends beyond the grave: <HI>Si qua e&s;t ea cura,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>He has left me to the tickli&s;h management of &s;o narrow a fortune, that any one fal&s;e &s;tep would be fatal. My mother is in that di&s;pirited &s;tate of re&s;ignation, which is the effect of long life, and the lo&s;s of what is dear to us. We are really each of us in want of a friend, of &s;uch an humane turn as your&s;elf, to make al|mo&s;t any thing de&s;irable to us. I feel your ab|&s;ence more than ever, at the &s;ame time I can le&s;s expre&s;s my regards to you than ever; and &s;hall make this, which is the mo&s;t &s;incere let|ter

I ever writ to you, the &s;horte&s;t and fainte&s;t perhaps of any you have received. 'Tis enough if you reflect, that barely to remember any per|&s;on when one's mind is taken up with a &s;en&s;ible &s;orrow, is a great degree of friend&s;hip. I can &s;ay no more but that I love you, and all that are yours; and that I wi&s;h it may be very long before any of yours &s;hall feel for you what I now feel for my father.</P>

<P>YOUR kind letter has overtaken me here, for I have been in and about this country ever &s;ince your departure. I am well pleas'd to date this from a place &s;o well known to Mrs. Blount, where I write as if I were dictated to by her ance&s;tors, who&s;e faces are all upon me. I fear none &s;o much as Sir Chri&s;topher Gui&s;e, who, being in his &s;hirt, &s;eems as ready to com|bate me, as her own Sir John was to demoli&s;h Duke Lanca&s;tere. I dare &s;ay your lady will re|collect his figure. I look'd upon the man&s;ion, walls, and terraces; the plantations, and &s;lopes, which nature has made to command a variety of valleys and ri&s;ing woods; with a veneration
<PB N="30" REF="42">
mix'd with a plea&s;ure, that repre&s;ented her to me in tho&s;e puerile amu&s;ements, which en|gaged her &s;o many years ago in this place. I fancied I &s;aw her &s;ober over a &s;ampler, or gay over a jointed baby. I dare &s;ay &s;he did one thing more, even in tho&s;e early times; <Q>&startq;re|member'd her Creator in the days of her youth.&endq;</Q></P>
<P>You de&s;cribe &s;o well your hermitical &s;tate of life, than none of the ancient anchorites could go beyond you&punc; for a cave in a rock, with a fine &s;pring, or any of the accommodations that befit a &s;olitary. Only I don't remember to have read, that any of tho&s;e venerable and holy per|&s;onages took with them a lady, and begat &s;ons and daughters. You mu&s;t mode&s;tly be content to be accounted a patriarch. But were you a little younger, I &s;hould rather rank you with Sir Amadis, and his fellows. If Piety be &s;o ro|mantic, I &s;hall turn hermit in good earne&s;t; for, I &s;ee, one may go &s;o far as to be poetical, and hope to &s;ave one's &s;oul at the &s;ame time. I real|ly wi&s;h my&s;elf &s;omething more, that is, a pro|phet; for I wi&s;h I were, as Habakkuk, to be taken by the hair of his head, and vi&s;it Daniel in his den. You are very obliging in &s;aying, I have now a whole family upon my hands to whom to di&s;charge the part of a friend; I a&s;&s;ure you, I like them all &s;o well, that I will never

<P>YOUR very kind and obliging manner of enquiring after me, among the fir&s;t con|cerns of life, at your re&s;u&s;citation, &s;hould have been &s;ooner an&s;wer'd and acknowledged. I &s;incerely rejoice at your recovery from an illne&s;s which gave me le&s;s pain than it did you, only from my ignorance of it. I &s;hould have el&s;e been &s;eriou&s;ly and deeply afflicted, in the thought of your danger by a fever. I think it a fine and a natural thought, which I lately read in a letter of Montaigne's publi&s;h'd by P. Co&s;te, giving an account of the la&s;t words of an intimate friend of his: <Q>&startq;Adieu, my friend!
<PB N="32" REF="44">
the pain I feel will &s;oon be over; but I grieve for that you are to feel, which is to la&s;t you for life.&endq;</Q></P>
<P>I join with your family in giving God thanks for lending us a worthy man &s;omewhat longer. The comforts you receive from their attend|ance, put me in mind of what old Fletcher of Saltoune &s;aid one day to me. <Q>&startq;Alas, I have nothing to do but to die; I am a poor indivi|dual; no creature to wi&s;h, or to fear, for my life or death: 'Tis the only rea&s;on I have to repent being a &s;ingle man; now I grow old, I am like a tree without a prop, and without young trees to grow round me, for company and defence.&endq;</Q></P>
<P>I hope the gout will &s;oon go after the fever, and all evil things remove far from you. But pray tell me, when will you move towards us? If you had an interval to get hither, I care not what fixes you afterwards except the gout. Pray come, and never &s;tir from us again. Do away your dirty acres, ca&s;t them to dirty people, &s;uch as in the Scripture-phra&s;e po&s;&s;e&s;s the land. Shake off your earth like the noble animal in Milton,</P>
<LG>

The lizard, and the tiger, as the mole</L>
<L>Ri&s;ing, the crumbled earth above them Threw</L>

</LG>
<P>But, I believe, Milton never thought the&s;e fine ver&s;es of his &s;hould be apply'd to a man &s;elling a parcel of dirty acres; tho' in the main, I think, it may have &s;ome re&s;emblance. For, God knows! this little &s;pace of ground nou|ri&s;hes, buries, and confines us, as that of Eden did tho&s;e creatures, till we can &s;hake it loo&s;e, at lea&s;t in our affections and de&s;ires.</P>
<P>Believe, dear Sir, I truly love and value you: let Mrs. Blount know that &s;he is in the li&s;t of my <HI>Memento, Domine, famulorum famularum|que's,</HI> &amp;c. My poor mother is far from well, declining; and I am watching over her, as we watch an expiring taper, that even when it looks brighte&s;t, wa&s;tes fa&s;te&s;t.

whole family; with all which, I cannot deny but I have a mixture of envy to you all, for loving one another &s;o well; and for enjoy|ing the &s;weets of that life, which can only be ta&s;ted by people of good-will.

Torbay is a paradi&s;e, and a &s;torm is but an amu&s;ement to &s;uch people. If you drink Tea upon a promontory that over-hangs the &s;ea, it is preferable to an A&s;&s;embly: and the whi&s;tling of the wind better mu&s;ic to contented and lov|ing minds, than the Opera to the &s;pleenful, ambitious, di&s;eas'd, di&s;ta&s;ted, and di&s;tracted &s;ouls which this world affords; nay, this world affords no other. Happy they, who are ba|ni&s;h'd from us! but happier they, who can bani&s;h them&s;elves; or more properly bani&s;h the world from them!</P>
<Q><L>Alas! I live at Twickenham!</L></Q>
<P>I take that period to be very &s;ublime, and to include more than a hundred &s;entences that might be writ to expre&s;s di&s;traction, hurry, mul|tiplication of nothings, and all the fatiguing per|petual bu&s;ine&s;s of having no bu&s;ine&s;s to do. You'll wonder I reckon tran&s;lating the Ody&s;&s;ey as nothing. But whenever I think &s;eriou&s;ly (and of late I have met with &s;o many occa&s;ions
<PB N="35" REF="47">
of thinking &s;eriou&s;ly, that I begin never to think otherwi&s;e) I cannot but think the&s;e things very idle; as idle as if a bea&s;t of burden &s;hould go on gingling his bells, without bearing any thing valuable about him, or ever &s;erving his ma&s;ter.
<Q><L>Life's vain Amu&s;ements, amid&s;t which we dwell;</L>

<P>I remember I promis'd to write to you, as &s;oon as I &s;hould hear you were got home. You mu&s;t look on this as the fir&s;t day I've been my|&s;elf, and pa&s;s over the mad interval un-imputed to me. How punctual a corre&s;pondent I &s;hall hence-forward be able or not able to be, God knows: but he knows, I &s;hall ever be a punc|tual and grateful friend, and all the good wi&s;hes of &s;uch an one will ever attend you.</P>

As to forgetfulne&s;s of you or yours, I a&s;&s;ure you, the promi&s;cuous conver&s;ations of the town &s;erve only to put me in mind of better, and more quiet, to be had in a corner of the world (undi&s;turb'd, inno|cent, &s;erene, and &s;en&s;ible) with &s;uch as you. Let no acce&s;s of any di&s;tru&s;t make you think of me differently in a cloudy day from what you do in the mo&s;t &s;un&s;hiny weather. Let the young ladies be a&s;&s;ured I make nothing new in my gardens without wi&s;hing to &s;ee the print of their fairy &s;teps in every part of them. I have put the la&s;t hand to my works of this kind, in hap|pily fini&s;hing the &s;ubterraneous way and grotto: I there found a &s;pring of the cleare&s;t water, which falls in a perpetual rill, that echoes thro' the cavern day and night. From the river Thames, you &s;ee thro' my arch up a walk of the wilderne&s;s, to a kind of open Temple, wholly compos'd of &s;hells in the ru&s;tic man|ner; and from that di&s;tance under the temple you look down thro' a &s;loping arcade of trees,
<PB N="37" REF="49">
and &s;ee the &s;ails on the river pa&s;&s;ing &s;uddenly and vani&s;hing, as thro' a per&s;pective gla&s;s. When you &s;hut the doors of this grotto, it be|comes on the in&s;tant, from a luminous room, a <HI>Camera ob&s;cura;</HI> on the walls of which all the objects of the river, hills, woods, and boats, are forming a moving picture in their vi&s;ible radia|tions: and when you have a mind to light it up, it affords you a very different &s;cene; it is fini&s;hed with &s;hells inter&s;per&s;ed with pieces of looking-gla&s;s in angular forms; and in the ciel|ing is a &s;tar of the &s;ame material, at which when a lamp (of an orbicular figure of thin ala|ba&s;ter) is hung in the middle, a thou&s;and point|ed rays glitter, and are reflected over the place. There are connected to this grotto by a nar|rower pa&s;&s;age two porches, one towards the ri|ver of &s;mooth &s;tones full of light, and open; the other toward the Garden &s;hadow'd with trees, rough with &s;hells, flints, and iron-ore. The bottom is paved with &s;imple pebble, as is al&s;o the adjoining walk up the wilderne&s;s to the temple, in the natural ta&s;te, agreeing not ill with the little dripping murmur, and the aqua|tic idea of the whole place. It wants nothing to complete it but a good &s;tatue with an in|&s;cription, like that beautiful antique one which you know I am &s;o fond of,</P>

The &s;ummer is a kind of heaven, when we wander in a paradi&s;aical &s;cene among groves and gardens; but at this &s;ea&s;on, we are, like our poor fir&s;t parents, turn'd out of that agreeable though &s;olitary life, and forced to look about for more people to help to bear our labours, to get into warmer hou&s;es, and live together in cities.</P>

<P>I Have read your letter over and over with delight. By your de&s;cription of the town, I imagine it to lie under &s;ome great enchant|ment, and am very much concerned for you and all my friends in it. I am the more afraid, imagining, &s;ince you do not fly tho&s;e horrible mon&s;ters, rapine, di&s;&s;imulation, and luxury, that a magic circle is drawn about you, and you can|not e&s;cape. We are here in the country in quite another world, &s;urrounded with ble&s;|&s;ings and plea&s;ures, without any occa&s;ion of ex|erci&s;ing our ira&s;cible faculties; indeed we can|not boa&s;t of good-breeding and the art of life, but yet we don't live unplea&s;antly in primitive &s;im|plicity and good-humour. The fa&s;hions of the town affect us but ju&s;t like a raree-&s;how, we have a curio&s;ity to peep at them, and nothing more. What you call pride, prodigality, and vain-glory, we cannot find in pomp and &s;plen|dor at this di&s;tance; it appears to us a fine glit|tering &s;cene, which if we don't envy you, we think you happier than we are, in your enjoy|ing it. Whatever you may think to per&s;uade us of the humility of Virtue, and her appearing

in rags among&s;t you, we can never believe: our uninform'd minds repre&s;ent her &s;o noble to us, that we nece&s;&s;arily annex &s;plendor to her: and we could as &s;oon imagine the order of things inverted, and that there is no man in the moon, as believe the contrary. I can't forbear telling you we indeed read the &s;poils of Rapine as boys do the Engli&s;h rogue, and hug our&s;elves full as much over it; yet our ro&s;es are not without thorns.

<P>YOu'll think me very full of my&s;elf, when after long &s;ilence (which however, to &s;ay truth, has rather been employed to contemplate of you, than to forget you) I begin to talk of my own works. I find it is in the fini&s;hing a book, as in concluding a &s;e&s;&s;ion of Parliament, one always thinks it will be very &s;oon, and finds it very late. There are many unlook'd-for in|cidents to retard the clearing any public ac|count, and &s;o I &s;ee it is in mine. I have plagued my&s;elf, like great mini&s;ters, with undertaking too much for one man; and with a de&s;ire
<PB N="49" REF="63">
of doing more than was expected from me, have done le&s;s than I ought.</P>
<P>For having de&s;ign'd four very laborious and uncommon &s;ort of Indexes to Homer, I'm forc'd, for want of time, to publi&s;h two only; the de|&s;ign of which you will own to be pretty, tho' far from being fully executed. I've al&s;o been obliged to leave unfini&s;h'd in my de&s;k the heads of two E&s;&s;ays, one on the Theology and Mora|lity of Homer, and another on the Oratory of Homer and Virgil. So they mu&s;t wait for fu|ture editions, or peri&s;h: and (one way or other, no great matter which) <HI>dabit Deus his quoque finem.</HI> I think of you every day, I a&s;&s;ure you, even without &s;uch good memorials of you as your &s;i&s;ters, with whom I &s;ometimes talk of you, and find it one of the mo&s;t agreeable of all &s;ubjects to them. My Lord Digby mu&s;t be perpetually remember'd by all who ever knew him, or knew his children. There needs no more than an acquaintance with your fami|ly, to make all elder &s;ons wi&s;h they had fathers to their lives end.</P>
<P>I can't touch upon the &s;ubject of filial love, without putting you in mind of an old woman, who has a &s;incere, hearty, old-fa&s;hion'd re&s;pect for you, and con&s;tantly blames her &s;on for not having writ to you oftener to tell you &s;o.</P>

I very much wi&s;h (but what &s;ignifies my wi&s;hing? my lady Scudamore wi&s;hes, your &s;i|&s;ters wi&s;h) that you were with us, to compare the beautiful contra&s;te this &s;ea&s;on affords us, of the town and the country. No ideas you could form in the winter can make you imagine what Twickenham is (and what your friend Mr. John&s;on of Twickenham is) in this warmer &s;ea|&s;on. Our river glitters beneath an unclouded &s;un, at the &s;ame time that its banks retain the verdure of &s;howers: our gardens are offering their fir&s;t no&s;egays; our trees, like new ac|quaintance brought happily together, are &s;tretch|ing their arms to meet each other, and grow|ing nearer and nearer every hour; the birds are paying their thank&s;giving &s;ongs for the new ha|bitations I have made them; my building ri&s;es high enough to attract the eye and curio&s;ity of the pa&s;&s;enger from the river, where, upon be|holding a mixture of beauty and ruin, he en|quires what hou&s;e is falling, or what church is ri&s;ing? So little ta&s;te have our common Tritons of Vitruvius; whatever delight the poetical gods of the river may take, in reflecting on their &s;treams, my Tu&s;can Porticos, or Ionic Pila|&s;ters.</P>
<P>But to (de&s;cend from all this pomp of &s;tyle) the be&s;t account of what I am building, is, that
<PB N="51" REF="65">
it will afford me a few plea&s;ant rooms for &s;uch a friend as your&s;elf, or a cool &s;ituation for an hour or two for Lady Scudamore, when &s;he will do me the honour (at this public hou&s;e on the road) to drink her own cyder.</P>
<P>The moment I am writing this, I am &s;ur|prized with the account of the death of a friend of mine; which makes all I have here been talk|ing of, a mere je&s;t! Building, gardens, writings, plea&s;ures, works, of whatever &s;tuff man can rai&s;e! none of them (God knows) capable of advantaging a creature that is mortal, or of &s;a|tisfying a &s;oul that is immortal!

<P>YOUR letter, which I had two po&s;ts ago, was very medicinal to me; and I heartily thank you for the relief it gave me. I was &s;ick of the thoughts of my not having in all this time given you any te&s;timony of the affection I owe you, and which I as con&s;tantly indeed feel as I think of you. This indeed was a trou|ble&s;ome ill to me, till, after reading your letter,
<PB N="52" REF="66">
I found it was a mo&s;t idle weak imagination to think I could &s;o offend you. Of all the im|pre&s;&s;ions you have made upon me, I never re|ceiv'd any with greater joy than this of your abundant good-nature, which bids me be a&s;&s;ured of &s;ome &s;hare of your affections.</P>
<P>I had many other plea&s;ures from your letter; that your mother remembers me is a very &s;in|cere joy to me; I cannot but reflect how alike you are; from the time you do any one a fa|vour, you think your&s;elves obliged as tho&s;e that have received one. This is indeed an old|fa&s;hioned re&s;pect, hardly to be found out of your hou&s;e. I have great hopes however, to &s;ee many old-fa&s;hioned virtues revive, &s;ince you have made our age in love with Homer; I hear|tily wi&s;h you, who are as good a citizen as a poet, the joy of &s;eeing a reformation from your works. I am in doubt whether I &s;hould con|gratulate your having fini&s;hed Homer, while the two e&s;&s;ays you mention are not completed; but if you expect no great trouble from fini&s;h|ing the&s;e, I heartily rejoice with you.</P>
<P>I have &s;ome faint notion of the beauties of Twickenham from what I here &s;ee round me. The verdure of &s;howers is poured upon every tree and field about us; the gardens unfold va|riety of colours to the eye every morning, the hedges breath is beyond all per&s;ume, and the
<PB N="53" REF="67">
&s;ong of birds we hear as well as you. But tho' I hear and &s;ee all this, yet I think they would delight me more if you was here. I found the want of the&s;e at Twickenham while I was there with you, by which I gue&s;s what an increa&s;e of charms it mu&s;t now have. How kind is it in you to wi&s;h me there, and how unfortunate are my circum&s;tances that allow me not to vi&s;it you? If I &s;ee you, I mu&s;t leave my Father alone, and this unea&s;y thought would di&s;ap|point all my propo&s;ed plea&s;ures; the &s;ame cir|cum&s;tance will prevent my pro&s;pect of many happy hours with you in Lord Bathur&s;t's wood, and I fear of &s;eeing you till winter, unle&s;s Lady Scudamore comes to Sherburne, in which ca&s;e I &s;hall pre&s;s you to &s;ee Dor&s;et&s;hire, as you pro|po&s;ed.

<P>DOctor Arbuthnot is going to Bath, and will &s;tay there a fortnight or more: perhaps you would be comforted to have a &s;ight of him, whether you need him or not. I think him as good a Doctor as any man for one that is ill, and a better Doctor for one that is well. He would do admirably for Mrs. Mary Digby: &s;he needed only to follow his hints, to be in eternal bu&s;ine&s;s and amu&s;ement of mind, and even as active as &s;he could de&s;ire.

How much I wi&s;h to be her guide thro' that en|chanted fore&s;t, is not to be expre&s;t: I look up|on my&s;elf as the magician appropriated to the place, without whom no mortal can penetrate into the rece&s;&s;es of tho&s;e &s;acred &s;hades. I could pa&s;s whole days, in only de&s;cribing to her the future, and as yet vi&s;ionary beauties, that are to ri&s;e in tho&s;e &s;cenes: the palace that is to be built, the pavillions that are to glitter, the colo|nades that are to adorn them: nay more, the meeting of the Thames and the Severn, which (when the noble owner has finer dreams than ordinary) are to be led into each other's em|braces thro' &s;ecret caverns of not above twelve or fifteen miles, till they ri&s;e and celebrate their marriage in the mid&s;t of an immen&s;e amphithe|atre, which is to be the admiration of po&s;terity, a hundred years hence. But till the de&s;tin'd time &s;hall arrive that is to manife&s;t the&s;e won|ders, Mrs. Digby mu&s;t content her&s;elf with &s;ee|ing

<P>The objects that attract this part of the world, are of a quite different nature. Wo|men of quality are all turn'd followers of the camp in Hyde-Park this year, whither all the town re&s;ort to magnificent entertainments given by the officers, &amp;c. The Scythian Ladies that dwelt in the waggons of war, were not more clo&s;ely attached to the luggage. The matrons, like tho&s;e of Sparta, attend their &s;ons to the field, to be the witne&s;&s;es of their glorious deeds; and the maidens with all their charms di&s;play'd, provoke the &s;pirit of the Soldiers: Tea and Coffee &s;upply the place of Lacedemonian black broth. This Camp &s;eems crown'd with per|petual victory, for every &s;un that ri&s;es in the thunder of cannon, &s;ets in the mu&s;ick of vio|lins. Nothing is yet wanting but the con&s;tant pre&s;ence of the Prince&s;s, to repre&s;ent the <HI>Mater Exercitus.</HI></P>
<P>At Twickenham the world goes otherwi&s;e. There are certain old people who take up all my time, and will hardly allow me to keep any other company. They were introduced here by a man of their own &s;ort, who has made me perfectly rude to all contemporaries, and won't &s;o much as &s;uffer me to look upon them.

<P>I Can't return from &s;o agreeable an entertain|ment as yours in the country, without ac|knowledging it. I thank you heartily for the new agreeable idea of life you there gave me; it will remain long with me, for it is very &s;trong|ly impre&s;&s;ed upon my imagination. I repeat the memory of it often, and &s;hall value that faculty of the mind now more than ever, for the power it gives me of being entertained in your villa, when ab&s;ent from it. As you are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of all the plea&s;ures of the country, and, as I think, of a right mind, what can I wi&s;h you but health to enjoy them? This I &s;o hear|tily do, that I &s;hould be even glad to hear your good old mother might lo&s;e all her pre&s;ent plea&s;ures in her unwearied care of you, by your better health convincing them it is unne|ce&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>I am troubled and &s;hall be &s;o till I hear you have received this letter: for you gave me the greate&s;t plea&s;ure imaginable in yours, and I am impatient to acknowledge it. If I any ways de&s;erve that friendly warmth and affection with
<PB N="68" REF="82">
which you write, it is, that I have a heart full of love and e&s;teem for you: &s;o truly, that I &s;hould lo&s;e the greate&s;t plea&s;ure of my life if I lo&s;t your good opinion. It rejoices me very much to be reckoned by you in the cla&s;s of ho|ne&s;t men; for tho' I am not troubled over|much about the opinion mo&s;t may have of me, yet, I own, it would grieve me not to be thought well of, by you and &s;ome few others. I will not doubt my own &s;trength, yet I have this fur|ther &s;ecurity to maintain my integrity, that I cannot part with that, without forfeiting your e&s;teem with it.</P>
<P>Perpetual di&s;order and ill health have for &s;ome years &s;o di&s;gui&s;ed me, that, I &s;ometimes fear I do not to my be&s;t friends enough appear what I really am. Sickne&s;s is a great oppre&s;&s;or; it does great injury to a zealous heart, &s;tifling its warmth, and not &s;uffering it to break out in action. But, I hope, I &s;hall not make this com|plaint much longer. I have other hopes that plea&s;e me too, tho' not &s;o well grounded; the&s;e are, that you may yet make a journey we&s;t|ward with Lord Bathur&s;t; but of the probabi|lity of this I do not venture to rea&s;on, becau&s;e I would not part with the plea&s;ure of that be|lief. It grieves me to think how far I am re|moved from you, and from that excellent Lord, whom I love! Indeed I remember him, as one
<PB N="69" REF="83">
that has made &s;ickne&s;s ea&s;y to me, by bearing with my infirmities in the &s;ame manner that you have always done. I often too con&s;ider him in other lights that make him valuable to me. With him, I know not by what connec|tion, you never fail to come into my mind, as if you were in&s;eparable. I have, as you gue&s;s, many philo&s;ophical reveries in the &s;hades of Sir Walter Raleigh, of which you are a great part. You generally enter there with me, and like a good Genius, applaud and &s;trengthen all my &s;en|timents that have honour in them. This good office which you have often done me unknow|ingly, I mu&s;t acknowledge now, that my own brea&s;t may not reproach me with ingratitude, and di&s;quiet me when I would mu&s;e again in that &s;olemn &s;cene. I have not room now left to a&s;k you many que&s;tions I intended about the Ody&s;&s;ey. I beg I may know how far you have carried Uly&s;&s;es on his journey, and how you have been entertained with him on the way? I de&s;ire I may hear of your health, of Mrs. Pope's, and of every thing el&s;e that belongs to you.</P>
<P>How thrive your garden plants? how look the trees? how &s;pring the Brocoli and the Fe|nochio? hard names to &s;pell! how did the pop|pies bloom? and how is the great room ap|proved? what parties have you had of plea|&s;ure?

I &s;hould be &s;orry to &s;ee my Lady Scudamore's, till it has had the full advantage of Lord B* improve|ments; and then I will expect &s;omething like the waters of Ri&s;kins, and the woods of Oak|ley together, which (without flattery) would be at lea&s;t as good as any thing in our world:
<PB N="74" REF="88">
For as to the hanging gardens of Babylon, the Paradi&s;e of Cyrus, and the Sharawaggi's of China, I have little or no ideas of them, but, I dare &s;ay, Lord B* has, becau&s;e they were cer|tainly both very great, and very wild. I hope Mrs. Mary Digby is quite tired of his Lord|&s;hip's <HI>Extravagante Bergerie:</HI> and that &s;he is ju&s;t now &s;itting, or rather reclining on a bank, fatigued with over much dancing and &s;inging at his unwearied reque&s;t and in&s;tigation. I know your love of ea&s;e &s;o well, that you might be in danger of being too quiet to enjoy quiet, and too philo&s;ophical to be a philo&s;opher; were it not for the ferment Lord B. will put you into. One of his Lord&s;hip's maxims is, that a total ab&s;tinence from intemperance or bu|&s;ine&s;s, is no more philo&s;ophy, than a total con|&s;opition of the &s;en&s;es is repo&s;e; one mu&s;t feel enough of its contrary to have a reli&s;h of either. But, after all, let your temper work, and be as &s;edate and contemplative as you will, I'll en|gage you &s;hall be fit for any of us, when you come to town in the winter. Folly will laugh you into all the cu&s;toms of the company here; nothing will be able to prevent your conver|&s;ion to her, but indi&s;po&s;ition, which, I hope, will be far from you. I am telling the wor&s;t that can come of you; for as to vice, you are &s;afe; but folly is many an hone&s;t man's, nay

But here in town, I a&s;&s;ure you, men, women, and children have done with the&s;e things. Charity not only begins, but ends, at home.

<P>I wi&s;h that Heaven would open the eyes of men, and make them &s;en&s;ible which of the&s;e is right; whether, upon a due conviction, we are to quit faction, and gaming, and high-feeding, and all manner of luxury, and take to your country way? or you to leave prayers, and alm&s;giving, and reading, and exerci&s;e, and come into our mea&s;ures?

In other matters which relate to polite writing, I &s;hall &s;eldom differ from you: or, if I do, &s;hall, I hope, have the prudence to conceal my opi|nion.

<P>I Have nothing to &s;ay to you on that melan|choly &s;ubject, with an account of which the printed papers have furni&s;h'd me, but what you have already &s;aid to your&s;elf.</P>
<P>When you have paid the debt of tenderne&s;s you owe to the memory of a Father, I doubt not but you will turn your thoughts towards improving that accident to your own ea&s;e and happine&s;s. You have it now in your power, to pur&s;ue that method of thinking and living which you like be&s;t.

<DATELINE><DATE>Nov. 20, 1717.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I Am truly obliged by your kind condolence on my Father's death, and the de&s;ire you expre&s;s that I &s;hould improve this incident to my advantage. I know your Lord&s;hip's friend|&s;hip to me is &s;o exten&s;ive, that you include in that wi&s;h both my &s;piritual and my temporal advantage; and it is what I owe to that friend|&s;hip, to open my mind unre&s;ervedly to you on this head. It is true, I have lo&s;t a parent for whom no gains I could make would be any equivalent. But that was not my only tye: I thank God another &s;till remains (and long may it remain) of the &s;ame tender nature: <HI>Geni|trix e&s;t mihi</HI>&mdash;and excu&s;e me if I &s;ay with Eu|ryalus,
<Q><L>nequeam lacrymas perferre parentis.</L></Q>
A rigid divine may call it a carnal tye, but &s;ure it is a virtuous one: at lea&s;t I am more certain
<PB N="86" REF="100">
that it is a duty of nature to pre&s;erve a good parent's life and happine&s;s, than I am of any &s;peculative point whatever.</P>
<P><Q><L>Ignaram hujus quodcunque pericli</L>
<L>Hanc ego, nunc, linquam?</L></Q>
For &s;he, my Lord, would think this &s;eparation more grievous than any other, and I, for my part, know as little as poor Euryalus did, of the &s;ucce&s;s of &s;uch an adventure, (for an Ad|venture it is, and no &s;mall one, in &s;pite of the mo&s;t po&s;itive divinity.) Whether the change would be to my &s;piritual advantage, God only knows: this I know, that I mean as well in the religion I now profe&s;s, as I can po&s;&s;ibly ever do in another. Can a man who thinks &s;o, ju&s;tify a change, even if he thought both equal|ly good? To &s;uch an one, the part of <HI>Joyning</HI> with any one body of Chri&s;tians might perhaps be ea&s;y, but I think it would not be &s;o, to <HI>Re|nounce</HI> the other.</P>
<P>Your Lord&s;hip has formerly advis'd me to read the be&s;t controver&s;ies between the Churches, Shall I tell you a &s;ecret? I did &s;o at fourteen years old, (for I loved reading, and my father had no other books) there was a collection of all that had been written on both &s;ides in the reign of King James the &s;econd: I warm'd my head with them, and the con&s;equence was, that
<PB N="87" REF="101">
I found my&s;elf a Papi&s;t and a Prote&s;tant by turns, according to the la&s;t book I read <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">This is an admirable de|&s;cription of every Reader la|bouring in religious contro|ver&s;y, without po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the <HI>principles</HI> on which a right judgment of the points in que&s;tion is to be regulated.</NOTE>. I am afraid mo&s;t Seekers are in the &s;ame ca&s;e, and when they &s;top, they are not &s;o properly converted, as out-witted. You &s;ee how little glory you would gain by my conver&s;ion. And after all, I verily believe your Lord&s;hip and I are both of the &s;ame religion, if we were tho|roughly under&s;tood by one another, and that all hone&s;t and rea&s;onable chri&s;tians would be &s;o, if they did but talk enough together every day; and had nothing to do together, but to &s;erve God, and live in peace with their neighbour.</P>
<P>As to the <HI>temporal</HI> &s;ide of the que&s;tion, I can have no di&s;pute with you; it is certain, all the beneficial circum&s;tances of life, and all the &s;hining ones, lie on the part you would invite me to. But if I could bring my&s;elf to fancy, what I think you do but fancy, that I have any talents for active life, I want health for it; and be&s;ides it is a real truth, I have le&s;s Inclination (if po&s;&s;ible) than Ability. Contemplative life is not only my &s;cene, but it is my habit too. I begun my life where mo&s;t people end theirs, with a di&s;-reli&s;h of all that the world calls Am|bition:
<PB N="88" REF="102">
I don't know why 'tis call'd &s;o, for to me it always &s;eem'd to be rather <HI>&s;tooping</HI> than <HI>climbing.</HI> I'll tell you my politic and reli|gious &s;entiments in a few words. In my poli|tics, I think no further than how to pre&s;erve the peace of my life, in any government un|der which I live; nor in my religion, than to pre&s;erve the peace of my con&s;cience, in any church with which I communicate. I hope all churches and all governments are &s;o far of God, as they are rightly under&s;tood, and right|ly admini&s;tred: and where they are, or may be wrong, I leave it to God alone to mend or re|form them; which whenever he does, it mu&s;t be by greater in&s;truments than I am. I am not a Papi&s;t, for I renounce the temporal inva|&s;ions of the Papal power, and dete&s;t their ar|rogated authority over Princes and States. I am a Catholick in the &s;tricte&s;t &s;en&s;e of the word. If I was born under an ab&s;olute Prince, I would be a quiet &s;ubject; but I thank God I was not. I have a due &s;en&s;e of the excellence of the Bri|ti&s;h con&s;titution. In a word, the things I have always wi&s;hed to &s;ee are not a Roman Catho|lic, or a French Catholic, or a Spani&s;h Ca|tholic, but a true Catholic: and not a King of Whigs, or a King of Tories, but a King of England. Which God of his mercy grant his pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty may be, and all future Ma|je&s;ties:

What I now &s;end for your peru&s;al, I &s;hall &s;ay nothing of; not to fore&s;tall by a &s;ingle word what you pro|mis'd to &s;ay upon that &s;ubject.

happens in the ca&s;e of our death. Methinks God has puni&s;h'd the avaritious, as he often puni&s;hes &s;inners, in their own way, in the very &s;in it&s;elf: the thir&s;t of gain was their crime, that thir&s;t continued became their puni&s;hment and ruin. As for the few who have the good fortune, to remain with half of what they ima|gined they had (among whom is your hum|ble &s;ervant) I would have them &s;en&s;ible of their felicity, and convinced of the truth of old He|&s;iod's maxim, who, after half his e&s;tate was &s;wallowed by the <HI>Directors</HI> of tho&s;e days, re|&s;olv'd, that <HI>half</HI> to be <HI>more than the whole.</HI></P>

<P>Men &s;hall groan out of the <HI>CITY,</HI> and hi&s;s them out of their <HI>PLACE.</HI></P>
<P>They have dreamed out their dream, and awak|ing have found nothing in their hands.</P>
<P>Indeed the univer&s;al poverty, which is the con&s;equence of univer&s;al avarice, and which will fall harde&s;t upon the guiltle&s;s and indu&s;|trious part of mankind, is truly lamentable. The univer&s;al deluge of the S.

<P>The latter part of your letter does me &s;o much honour, and &s;hews me &s;o much kind|ne&s;s, that I mu&s;t both be proud and pleas'd, in a great degree; but I a&s;&s;ure you, my Lord, much more the la&s;t than the fir&s;t. For I cer|certainly know, and feel, from my own heart which truly re&s;pects you, that there may be a ground for your partiality, one way; but I find not the lea&s;t &s;ymptoms in my head, of any foundation for the other. In a word, the be&s;t rea&s;on I know for my being pleas'd, is, that you continue your favour toward me; the be&s;t I know for being proud, would be that you might cure me of it; for I have found you to be &s;uch a phy&s;ician as does not only <HI>repair,</HI> but <HI>improve.</HI> I am, with the &s;incere&s;t e&s;teem, and mo&s;t grateful acknowledgment,</P>

<P>And now, Sir, for your <HI>Arabian Tales.</HI> Ill as I have been, almo&s;t ever &s;ince they came to
<PB N="94" REF="108">
hand, I have read as much of them, as ever I &s;hall read while I live. Indeed they do not plea&s;e my ta&s;te: they are writ with &s;o roman|tick an air, and, allowing for the difference of ea&s;tern manners, are yet, upon any &s;uppo&s;i|tion that can be made, of &s;o wild and ab&s;urd a contrivance (at lea&s;t to my northern under&s;tand|ing) that I have not only no plea&s;ure, but no patience, in peru&s;ing them. They are to me like the odd paintings on Indian &s;creens, which at fir&s;t glance may &s;urprize and plea&s;e a little: but, when you fix your eye intently upon them, they appear &s;o extravagant, di&s;proportion'd, and mon&s;trous, that they give a judicious eye pain, and make him &s;eek for relief from &s;ome other object.</P>
<P>They may furni&s;h the mind with &s;ome new images: but I think the purcha&s;e is made at too great an expence: for to read tho&s;e two vo|lumes through, liking them as little as I do, would be a terrible penance, and to read them with plea&s;ure would be dangerous on the other &s;ide, becau&s;e of the infection. I will never believe, that you have any keen reli&s;h of them, till I find you write wor&s;e than you do, which, I dare &s;ay, I never &s;hall. Who that <HI>Petit de la Croi&s;e</HI> is, the pretended author of them <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Not the <HI>pretended Au|thor,</HI> but the real tran&s;lator, from an Arabic MS of the tales, which is in the French King's library. What was tran&s;lated in ten &s;mall Vo|lumes, is not more than the tenth part of the Original. The Ea&s;tern people have been always famous for this &s;ort of Compo&s;ition: in which much fine morality is con|veyed; not indeed in a &s;tory always repre&s;enting life and manners, but &s;uch as the ea|&s;tern &s;uper&s;titions made pa&s;s among&s;t the people for &s;uch. Their great genius for this kind of writing appears from the&s;e very tales. But the policy of &s;ome of the later princes of the Ea&s;t greatly hurt it, by &s;etting all men upon compo&s;ing them, to furni&s;h matter for their cof|fee-hou&s;es and places of re|&s;ort; which were enjoined to give this entertainment to the people, with de&s;ign to divert them from politics, and matters of &s;tate. This Collection is &s;o &s;trange a medley of &s;en&s;e and non&s;en&s;e, that one would be tempted to think the Collector was &s;ome Coffee-man, who ga|thered indifferently from the be&s;t and wor&s;t. The con|trivance he has invented of tying them together has led him into &s;uch a blunder that one could not be &s;ur|prized at anything. The tales are &s;uppo&s;ed to be told to one of the Kings of Per&s;ia of the ancient race before Ma|homet, and yet the &s;cene of &s;ome of them is laid in the Court of <HI>Harown Alra&s;|chid</HI> the 26^t^h Chalif, and the 5^t^h of the Race of <HI>Abba|&s;ides.</HI> The&s;e are among&s;t the be&s;t, and, indeed, it is no wonder. He was, of all the Chalifs, the mo&s;t munifi|cent, and the greate&s;t en|courager of Letters; &s;o that it was natural for men of ge|nius in after times, to do this honour to his memory. But the Bi&s;hop talks of <HI>Pe|tit de la Croi&s;e.</HI> M.

<P>I have &s;ent Dr. Arbuthnot<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Of Huetius, bi&s;hop of Avranches, left after his death.

This not being received for what he would give it, he compo&s;ed a treati&s;e <HI>of the weakne&s;s of the human under&s;tanding:</HI> a poor &s;y&s;tem of &s;ceptici&s;m; in|deed little other than an ab&s;|tract from <HI>Sextus Empiricus.</HI></NOTE> the Latin MS. which I could not find when you left me; and I am &s;o angry at the writer for his de&s;ign, and his manner of executing it, that I could hard|ly forbear &s;ending him a line of Virgil along with it.

<P>I Cannot but &s;u&s;pect my&s;elf of being very un|rea&s;onable in begging you once more to re|view the inclos'd. Your friend&s;hip draws this trouble on you. I may freely own to you, that
<PB N="100" REF="114">
my tenderne&s;s makes me exceeding hard to be &s;atisfied with any thing which can be &s;aid on &s;uch an unhappy &s;ubject. I caus'd the Latin Epitaph to be as often alter'd before I could approve it.</P>
<P>When once your Epitaph is &s;et up, there can be no alteration of it, it will remain a per|petual monument of your friend&s;hip, and, I a&s;|&s;ure my&s;elf, you will &s;o &s;ettle it, that it &s;hall be worthy of you. I doubt whether the word, <HI>deny'd,</HI> in the third line, will ju&s;tly admit of that con&s;truction which it ought to bear (viz.) renounced, de&s;erted, &amp;c. <HI>deny'd</HI> is capable, in my opinion, of having an ill &s;en&s;e put upon it, as too great unea&s;ine&s;s, or more good-nature, than a wi&s;e man ought to have. I very well remember you told me, you could &s;carce mend tho&s;e two lines, and therefore I can &s;carce ex|pect your forgivene&s;s for my de&s;iring you to re|con&s;ider them.</P>

<P>NOtwith&s;tanding I write this on Sunday even, to acknowledge the receipt of yours this morning: yet, I fore&s;ee, it will not reach you till Wedne&s;day morning. And before &s;et of &s;un that day I hope to reach my winter quar|ters at the Deanry. I hope, did I &s;ay? I re|call that word, for it implies de&s;ire: and, God knows, that is far from being the ca&s;e. For I never part with this place but with regret, tho' I generally keep here what Mr. Cowley calls the wor&s;t of company in the world, my own; and &s;ee either none be&s;ide, or what is wor&s;e than none, &s;ome of the <HI>Arrii,</HI> or <HI>Sebo&s;i</HI> of my neighbourhood: Characters, which Tully paints &s;o well in one of his Epi&s;tles, and complains of the too civil, but impertinent interruption they gave him in his retirement. Since I have named tho&s;e gentlemen, and the book is not far from me, I will turn to the place, and by pointing it out to you, give you the plea&s;ure of peru&s;ing the epi&s;tle, which is a very agreeable one, if my memory does not fail me.</P>

I vow to you, I could live here with plea&s;ure all the winter, and be contented with hearing no more news than the London Jour|nal, or &s;ome &s;uch trifling paper, affords me, did not the duty of my place require, ab&s;olutely require my attendance at We&s;tmin&s;ter; where, I hope, the Prophet will now and then remem|ber he has a bed and a candle&s;tic. In &s;hort, I long to &s;ee you, and hope you will come, if not a day, yet at lea&s;t an hour &s;ooner to town than you intended, in order to afford me that &s;atisfaction. I am now, I thank God! as well as ever I was in my life, except that I can walk &s;carce at all without crutches: And I would willingly compound the matter with the gout, to be no better, could I hope to be no wor&s;e; but that is a vain thought, I expect a new at|tack long before Chri&s;tmas.

<P>I believe I &s;hall &s;carce repeat that plea&s;ure any more, having other work to do, and other things to think of, but none that will interfere with the offices of friend&s;hip, in the exchange of which with you, Sir, I hope to live and die</P>

<P>UNDER all the lei&s;ure in the world, I have no lei&s;ure, no &s;tomach to write to you: The gradual approaches of death are be|fore my eyes; I am convinced that it mu&s;t be &s;o; and yet make a &s;hift to flatter my&s;elf &s;ome|times with the thought, that it may po&s;&s;ibly be otherwi&s;e. And that very thought, tho' it is directly contrary to my rea&s;on, does for a few moments make me ea&s;y&mdash;however not ea&s;y enough in good earne&s;t to think of any thing but the melancholy object that employs them. Therefore wonder not that I do not an&s;wer your kind letter: I &s;hall an&s;wer it too &s;oon, I fear, by accepting your friendly invitation.
<PB N="116" REF="130">
When I do &s;o, no conveniencies will be want|ing: for I'll &s;ee no body but you and your mother, and the &s;ervants. Vi&s;its to &s;tate&s;men always were to me (and are now more than ever) in&s;ipid things; let the men that expect, that wi&s;h to thrive by them, pay them that homage; I am free. When I want them, they &s;hall hear of me at their doors: and when they want me, I &s;hall be &s;ure to hear of them at mine. But probably they will de&s;pi&s;e me &s;o much, and I &s;hall court them &s;o little, that we &s;hall both of us keep our di&s;tance.</P>
<P>When I come to you, 'tis in order to be with you only; a pre&s;ident of the council, or a &s;tar and garter will make no more impre&s;&s;ion upon my mind, at &s;uch a time, than the hear|ing of a bag-pipe, or the &s;ight of a puppet-&s;hew. I have &s;aid to Greatne&s;s &s;ometime ago&mdash;<HI>Tuas tibi res habeto, Egomet curabo meas.</HI> The time is not far off when we &s;hall all be upon the level: and I am re&s;olv'd, for my part, to anti|cipate that time, and be upon the level with them now: for he is &s;o, that neither &s;eeks nor wants them. Let them have more virtue and le&s;s pride: and then I'll court them as much as any body: but till they re&s;olve to di&s;tingui&s;h them&s;elves &s;ome way el&s;e than by their outward trappings, I am determined (and, I think, I have a right) to be as proud as they are: tho' I tru&s;t
<PB N="117" REF="131">
in God, my pride is neither of &s;o odious a nature as theirs, nor of &s;o mi&s;chievous a con|&s;equence.</P>
<P>I know not how I have fallen into this train of thinking&mdash;when I &s;at down to write I in|tended only to excu&s;e my&s;elf for not writing, and to tell you that the time drew nearer and nearer, when I mu&s;t di&s;lodge; I am preparing for it: For I am at this moment building a vault in the Abby for me and mine. 'Twas to be in the Abby, becau&s;e of my relation to the place; but 'tis at the we&s;t door of it: as far from Kings and Kae&s;ars as the &s;pace will admit of.</P>
<P>I know not but I may &s;tep to town to morrow, to &s;ee how the work goes forward; but, if I do, I &s;hall return hither in the evening. I would not have given you the trouble of this letter but that they tell me it will co&s;t you no|thing, and that our privilege of Franking (one of the mo&s;t valuable we have left) is again allow'd us.</P>

<P>I Had much ado to get hither la&s;t night, the water being &s;o rough that the ferry-men
<PB N="118" REF="132">
were unwilling to venture. The fir&s;t thing I &s;aw this morning after my eyes were open, was your letter, for the freedom and kindne&s;s of which I thank you. Let all compliments be laid a&s;ide between us for the future; and de|pend upon me as your faithful friend in all things within my power, as one that truly values you, and wi&s;hes you all manner of happine&s;s. I thank you and Mrs. Pope for my kind recep|tion, which has left a plea&s;ing impre&s;&s;ion upon me that will not &s;oon be effaced.</P>
<P>Lord * has pre&s;s'd me terribly to &s;ee him at * and told me in a manner betwixt kindne&s;s and re&s;entment, that it is but a few miles be|yond Twitenham.</P>
<P>I have but a little time left, and a great deal to do in it; and mu&s;t expect that ill health will render a good &s;hare of it u&s;ele&s;s; and therefore what is likely to be left at the foot of the ac|count, ought by me to be cheri&s;h'd, and not thrown away in compliments. You know the Motto of my &s;un-dial, <HI>Vivite, ait, fugio.</HI> I will, as far as I am able, follow its advice, and cut off all unnece&s;&s;ary avocations and amu&s;e|ments. There are tho&s;e that intend to employ me this winter in a way I do not like: If they per&s;i&s;t in their intentions, I mu&s;t apply my&s;elf to the work they cut out for me, as well as I
<PB N="119" REF="133">
can. But withal, that &s;hall not hinder me from employing my&s;elf al&s;o in a way which they do not like. The givers of trouble one way &s;hall have their &s;hare of it another; that at la&s;t they may be induced to let me be quiet, and live to my&s;elf, with the few (the very few) friends I like; for that is the point, the &s;ingle point, I now aim at; tho', I know, the gene|rality of the world who are unacquainted with my intentions and views, think the very rever&s;e of this character belongs to me. I don't know how I have rambled into this account of my|&s;elf; when I fat down to write, I had no thought of making that any part of my letter.</P>
<P>You might have been &s;ure without my tell|ing you, that my right hand is at ea&s;e; el&s;e I &s;hould not have overflow'd at this rate. And yet I have not done, for there is a kind inti|mation in the end of yours, which I under|&s;tood, becau&s;e it &s;eems to tend towards em|ploying me in &s;omething that is agreeable to you. Pray explain your&s;elf, and believe that you have not an acquaintance in the world that would be more in earne&s;t on &s;uch an occa&s;ion than I, for I love you, as well as e&s;teem you.</P>
<P>All the while I have been writing, Pain, and a fine Thru&s;h have been &s;everally endea|vouring to call off my attention; but both in vain, nor &s;hould I yet part with you, but that

The Duche&s;s's<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">The Duche&s;s of Buckingham.</NOTE> letter concerns me nearly, and you know it, who know all my thoughts without di&s;gui&s;e: I mu&s;t keep clear of Flattery; I will: and as this is an hone&s;t re&s;olution, I dare hope, your Lord&s;hip will not be &s;o uncon|cern'd for my keeping it, as not to a&s;&s;i&s;t me in &s;o doing.

It never can me; who have lov'd and valued you, ever &s;ince I knew you, and &s;hall not fail to do it when I am not allowed to tell you &s;o; as the ca&s;e will &s;oon be. Give my faithful &s;ervices to Dr. Arbuthnot, and thanks for what he &s;ent me, which was much to the purpo&s;e, if any thing can be &s;aid to be to the purpo&s;e, in a ca&s;e that is already determined.

<P>IT is not po&s;&s;ible to expre&s;s what I think, and what I feel; only this, that I have thought and felt for nothing but you, for &s;ome time pa&s;t: and &s;hall think of nothing &s;o long for the time to come. The greate&s;t comfort I had was an intention (which I would have made practicable) to have attended you in your journey, to which I had brought that per&s;on to con&s;ent, who only could have hindered me, by a tye which, tho' it may be more tender, I do not think more &s;trong, tha that of friend|&s;hip. But I fear there will be no way left me to tell you this great truth, that I remember you, that I love you, that I am grateful to you, that I entirely e&s;teem and value you: no way but that one, which needs no open war|rant to authorize it, or &s;ecret conveyance to &s;ecure it; which no bills can preclude, and no Kings prevent; a way that can reach to any part of the world where you may be, where the very whi&s;per or even the wi&s;h of a friend mu&s;t not be heard, or even &s;u&s;pected: by this way, I dare tell my e&s;teem and affection of you, to your enemies in the gates, and you, and they, and their &s;ons, may hear of it.</P>
<P><PB N="129" REF="143">
You prove your&s;elf, my Lord, to know me for the friend I am; in judging that the man|ner of your Defence, and your Reputation by it, is a point of the highe&s;t concern to me: and a&s;&s;uring me, it &s;hall be &s;uch, that none of your friends &s;hall blu&s;h for you. Let me further prompt you to do your&s;elf the be&s;t and mo&s;t la&s;ting ju&s;tice: the in&s;truments of your Fame to po&s;terity will be in your own hands. May it not be, that providence has appointed you to &s;ome great and u&s;eful work, and calls you to it this &s;evere way? You may more eminently and more effectually &s;erve the Public even now, than in the &s;tations you have &s;o honourably fill'd.

<P>I am tenderly &s;en&s;ible of the wi&s;h you ex|pre&s;s, that no part of your misfortune may pur&s;ue me. But, God knows, I am every day le&s;s and le&s;s fond of my native country (&s;o torn as it is by Party-rage) and begin to con&s;ider a friend in exile as a friend in death; one gone before, where I am not unwilling nor unpre|pared
<PB N="130" REF="144">
to follow after; and where (however various or uncertain the roads and voyages of another world may be) I cannot but entertain a plea&s;ing hope that we may meet again.</P>
<P>I faithfully a&s;&s;ure you, that in the mean time there is no one, living or dead, of whom I &s;hall think oftener or better than of you. I &s;hall look upon you as in a &s;tate between both, in which you will have from me all the pa&s;&s;ions and warm wi&s;hes that can attend the living, and all the re&s;pect and tender &s;en&s;e of lo&s;s, that we feel for the dead. And I &s;hall ever depend up|on your con&s;tant friend&s;hip, kind memory, and good offices, tho' I were never to &s;ee or hear the effects of them: like the tru&s;t we have in benevolent &s;pirits, who, tho' we never &s;ee or hear them, we think, are con&s;tantly &s;erving us, and praying for us.</P>
<P>Whenever I am wi&s;hing to write to you, I &s;hall conclude you are intentionally doing &s;o to me. And every time that I think of you, I will believe you are thinking of me. I never &s;hall &s;uffer to be forgotten (nay to be but faint|ly remember'd) the honour, the plea&s;ure, the pride I mu&s;t ever have, in reflecting how fre|quently you have delighted me, how kindly you have di&s;tingui&s;h'd me, how cordially you have advis'd me!

If you retain any me|mory of the pa&s;t, let it only image to you what has pleas'd you be&s;t; &s;ometimes pre&s;ent a dream of an ab&s;ent friend, or bring you back an agree|able conver&s;ation. But upon the whole, I hope you will think le&s;s of the time pa&s;t than of the
<PB N="132" REF="146">
&s;uture; as the former has been le&s;s kind to you than the latter infallibly will be. Do not envy the world your Studies; they will tend to the benefit of men again&s;t whom you can have no complaint, I mean of all Po&s;terity; and per|haps, at your time of life, nothing el&s;e is worth your care. What is every year of a wi&s;e man's life but a cen&s;ure or critic on the pa&s;t? Tho&s;e who&s;e date is the &s;horte&s;t, live long enough to laugh at one half of it: the boy de&s;pi&s;es the in|fant, the man the boy, the philo&s;opher both, and the Chri&s;tian all. You may now begin to think your manhood was too much a puerility; and you'll never &s;uffer your age to be but a &s;econd in|fancy. The toys and baubles of your child|hood are hardly now more below you, than tho&s;e toys of our riper and of our declining years, the drums and rattles of Ambition, and the dirt and bubbles of Avarice. At this time, when you are cut off from a little &s;ociety and made a citizen of the world at large, you &s;hould bend your talents not to &s;erve a Party, or a few, but all mankind. Your Genius &s;hould mount above that mi&s;t in which its participation and neighbourhood with earth long involv'd it; to &s;hine abroad and to heaven, ought to be the bu&s;ine&s;s and the glory of your pre&s;ent &s;ituation. Remember it was at &s;uch a time, that the great|e&s;t lights of antiquity dazled and blazed the
<PB N="133" REF="147">
mo&s;t, in their retreat, in their exile, or in their death: but why do I talk of dazling or blazing? it was then that they did good, that they gave light, and that they became Guides to mankind.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e aims alone are worthy of &s;pirits truly great, and &s;uch I therefore hope will be yours. Re&s;entment indeed may remain, perhaps can|not be quite extingui&s;hed, in the noble&s;t minds; but Revenge never will harbour there: higher principles than tho&s;e of the fir&s;t, and better principles than tho&s;e of the latter, will infalli|bly influence men, who&s;e thoughts and who&s;e hearts are enlarged, and cau&s;e them to prefer the Whole to any part of mankind, e&s;pecially to &s;o &s;mall a part as one's &s;ingle &s;elf.</P>
<P>Believe me, my Lord, I look upon you as a &s;pirit entered into another life <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">The Bi&s;hop of Roche&s;|ter went into exile the month following, and continued in it till his death, which hap|pen'd at Paris on the fifteenth day of February in the year 1732. <BIBL>P.</BIBL></NOTE>, as one ju&s;t upon the edge of Immortality; where the pa&s;|&s;ions and affections mu&s;t be much more exalt|ed, and where you ought to de&s;pi&s;e all little views, and all mean retro&s;pects <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Notwith&s;tanding this, Mr. Pope was convinced, before the Bi&s;hop's death, that during his bani&s;hment he was in the intrigues of the Pretender.

I expected to have heard from you by Mr. Morice, and wondered a little that I did not; but he owns him&s;elf in a fault, for not giving you due notice of his motions. It was not ami&s;s that you forebore writing, on a head wherein I promis'd more than I was able to perform.

Were I as near you as I have been, I &s;hould hope to peep into the manu|&s;cript before it was fini&s;hed. But alas! there is, and will ever probably be a great deal of land and &s;ea between us.

<P>I Am not yet Ma&s;ter enough of my&s;elf, after the late wound I have receiv'd, to open my very heart to you, and am not content with le&s;s than that, whenever I conver&s;e with you. My thoughts are at pre&s;ent vainly, but plea&s;ingly employ'd, on what I have lo&s;t, and can never recover.

As &s;oon as my mind is in &s;ome mea&s;ure corrected and calm'd, I will endeavour to follow your advice, and turn it to &s;omething of u&s;e and moment; if I have &s;till life enough left to do any thing that is worth reading and pre&s;erving. In the mean time I &s;hall be pleas'd to hear that you proceed in what you intend, without any &s;uch melancho|ly interruption as I have met with. Your mind is as yet unbroken by age and ill accidents, your knowledge and judgment are at the height: u&s;e them in writing &s;omewhat that may teach the pre&s;ent and future times, and if not gain equally the applau&s;e of both, may yet rai&s;e the envy of the one, and &s;ecure the admiration of the other.

<Q><L>gelidus tardante &s;enecta</L></Q>
<P><HI>Sanguis hebet, frigentque effoeto in corpore vires.</HI> However, I &s;hould be ingrateful to this place, if I did not own that I have gained upon the gout in the &s;outh of France, much more than I did at Paris: tho' even there I &s;en&s;ibly improved. I believe my cure had been perfected, but the earne&s;t de&s;ire of meeting One I dearly loved, called me abruptly to Montpelier; where after continuing two months, under the cruel tor|ture of a &s;ad and fruitle&s;s expectation, I was forced at la&s;t to take a long journey to Tou|lou&s;e; and even there I had mi&s;s'd the per&s;on I &s;ought, had &s;he not, with great &s;pirit and cou|rage, ventured all night up the Garonne to &s;ee me, which &s;he above all things de&s;ired to do before &s;he died. By that means &s;he was brought where I was, between &s;even and eight in the morning, and liv'd twenty hours afterwards, which time was not lo&s;t on either &s;ide, but pa&s;s'd in &s;uch a manner as gave great &s;atisfac|tion to both, and &s;uch as on her part, every way became her circum&s;tances and character. For &s;he had her &s;en&s;es to the very la&s;t ga&s;p, and ex|erted them to give me, in tho&s;e few hours, greater marks of Duty and Love than &s;he had done in all her life time, tho' &s;he had never
<PB N="141" REF="155">
been wanting in either. The la&s;t words &s;he &s;aid to me were the kinde&s;t of all; a reflection on the goodne&s;s of God, which had allow'd us in this manner to meet once more, before we parted for ever. Not many minutes after that, &s;he laid her&s;elf on her pillow, in a &s;leeping po&s;|ture,
<Q><L>placidaque ibi demum morte quievit.</L></Q>
Judge you, Sir, what I felt, and &s;till feel on this occa&s;ion, and &s;pare me the trouble of de&s;cribing it. At my Age, under my Infirmities, among ut|ter Strangers, how &s;hall I find out proper re|liefs and &s;upports? I can have none, but tho&s;e with which Rea&s;on and Religion furni&s;h me, and tho&s;e I lay hold on, and gra&s;p as fa&s;t as I can. I hope that He, who laid the burthen upon me (for wi&s;e and good purpo&s;es no doubt) will enable me to bear it, in like manner as I have born others, with &s;ome degree of fortitude and firmne&s;s.</P>

You may gue&s;s in how unea&s;y a &s;tate I am, when every day the performances of others appear more beautiful and excellent, and my own more de|&s;picable. I have thrown away three Dr. Swifts, each of which was once my vanity, two Lady Bridgwaters, a Duche&s;s of Montague, be&s;ides half a dozen Earls, and one knight of the gar|ter. I have crucified Chri&s;t over again in effi|gie, and made a Madona as old as her mother St. Anne.

<P>WElcome to your native &s;oil <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">In the beginning of this year Mr. Gay went over to Hanover with the Earl of Clarendon, who was &s;ent thi|ther by Q: Anne.

If happy, I am to partake in your elevation; if unhappy, you have &s;till a warm corner in my heart, and a retreat at Bin|field in the wor&s;t of times at your &s;ervice. If you are a Tory, or thought &s;o by any man, I know it can proceed from nothing but your gratitude to a few people who endeavour'd to &s;erve you, and who&s;e politics were never your concern. If you are a Whig, as I rather hope, and, as I think, your principles and mine (as bro|ther poets) had ever a bias to the &s;ide of Li|berty, I know you will be an hone&s;t man, and

This I thought a convincing proof, how truly one may be a friend to another without telling him &s;o every month. But they had rea&s;ons too them&s;elves to alledge in your excu&s;e; as men who really value one another, will never want &s;uch as make their friends and them&s;elves ea&s;y. The late Univer&s;al concern in public affairs, threw us all into a hurry of &s;pirits: even I, who am more a Philo&s;opher than to expect any thing from any Reign, was borne away with the cur|rent, and full of the expectation of the Suc|ce&s;&s;or: During your journeys I knew not whi|ther to aim a letter after you; that was a &s;ort of &s;hooting flying: add to this the demand Ho|mer had upon me, to write fifty ver&s;es a day, be&s;ides learned notes, all which are at a conclu|&s;ion for this year. Rejoice with me, O my friend, that my labour is over; come and make merry with me in much fea&s;ting: We will

I take to be no great &s;ecurity to the brains of modern authors. But to let you &s;ee that the contrary to this often happens, I mu&s;t acquaint you, that the highe&s;t and mo&s;t extravagant heap of towers in the univer&s;e, which is in this neigh|bourhood, &s;tands &s;till undefaced, while a cock of barley in our next field has been con&s;umed to a&s;hes. Would to God that this heap of bar|ley had been all that had peri&s;hed! for unhap|pily beneath this little &s;helter &s;ate two much more con&s;tant Lovers than ever were found in Romance under the &s;hade of a beech-tree. John Hewet was a well-&s;et man of about five and twenty, Sarah Drew might be rather cal|led comely than beautiful, and was about the &s;ame age. They had pa&s;s'd thro' the various labours of the year together, with the greate&s;t &s;atisfaction; if &s;he milk'd, 'twas his morning and evening care, to bring the cows to her hand; it was but la&s;t fair that he bought her a pre&s;ent of green &s;ilk for her &s;traw hat, and the po&s;ie on her &s;ilver ring was of his chu&s;ing. Their love was the talk of the whole neigh|bourhood; for &s;candal never affirm'd, that they had any other views than the lawful po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of each other in marriage. It was that very morning that he had obtain'd the con&s;ent of her parents, and it was but till the next week that they were to wait to be happy. Perhaps in
<PB N="155" REF="169">
the intervals of their work they were now talk|ing of the wedding cloaths, and John was &s;uit|ing &s;everal &s;orts of poppies and field flowers to her complexion, to chu&s;e her a knot for the wedding-day. While they were thus bu&s;ied, (it was on the la&s;t of July between two or three in the afternoon) the clouds grew black, and &s;uch a &s;torm of lightning and thunder en&s;ued, that all the labourers made the be&s;t of their way to what &s;helter the trees and hedges af|forded. Sarah was frightned, and fell down in a &s;woon on a heap of barley. John, who never &s;eparated from her, &s;at down by her &s;ide, hav|ing raked together two or three heaps, the bet|ter to &s;ecure her from the &s;torm. Immediately there was heard &s;o loud a crack, as if heaven had &s;plit a&s;under; every one was now &s;ollici|tous for the &s;afety of his neighbour, and called to one another throughout the field: No an|&s;wer being returned to tho&s;e who called to our Lovers, they &s;tept to the place where they lay; they perceived the barley all in a &s;moke, and then &s;pied this faithful pair: John with one arm about Sarah's neck, and the other held over her, as to &s;kreen her from the lightning. They were &s;truck dead, and &s;tiffen'd in this tender po&s;ture. Sarah's left eye-brow was &s;ing'd, and there appeared a black &s;pot on her brea&s;t: her lover was all over black, but not

<P>WE cannot omit taking this occa&s;ion to congratulate you upon the encrea&s;e of your family, for your Cow is this morning very happily deliver'd of the better &s;ort, I mean a female calf; &s;he is as like her mother as &s;he can &s;tare. All Knights Errants Palfreys were di&s;tingui&s;h'd by lofty names: we &s;ee no rea&s;on why a Pa&s;toral Lady's &s;heep and calves &s;hould want names of the &s;ofter &s;ound; we have there|fore given her the name of Cae&s;ar's wife, Calf|urnia: imagining, that as Romulus and Remus were &s;uckled by a wolf, this Roman lady was &s;uckled by a cow, from whence &s;he took that name. In order to celebrate this birth|day, we had a cold dinner at Marble-hill <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Mrs. Howard's hou&s;e.</NOTE>, Mrs. Su&s;an offered us wine upon the occa&s;ion,
<PB N="168" REF="184">
and upon &s;uch an occa&s;ion we could not refu&s;e it. Our entertainment con&s;i&s;ted of fle&s;h and fi&s;h, and the lettice of a greek I&s;land called Cos. We have &s;ome thoughts of dining there to-morrow, to celebrate the day after the birth|day, and on friday to celebrate the day after that, where we intend to entertain Dean Swift; becau&s;e we think your hall the mo&s;t delightful room in the world except that where you are. If it was not for you, we would for&s;wear all courts; and really it is the mo&s;t mortifying thing in nature, that we can neither get into the court to live with you, nor you get into the country to live with us; &s;o we will take up with what we can get that belongs to you, and make our&s;elves as happy as we can, in your hou&s;e.</P>

<P>IF my friend&s;hip were as effectual as it is &s;incere, you would be one of tho&s;e people who would be va&s;tly advantaged and enrich'd by it. I ever honour'd tho&s;e Popes who were mo&s;t famous for Nepoti&s;m, 'tis a &s;ign that the old fellows loved Somebody, which is not u&s;ual in &s;uch advanced years. And I now honour Sir Robert Walpole for his exten&s;ive bounty and goodne&s;s to his private friends and relations. But it vexes me to the heart when I reflect, that my friend&s;hip is &s;o much le&s;s effectual than theirs; nay &s;o utterly u&s;ele&s;s that it cannot give you any thing, not even a dinner at this di|&s;tance, nor help the General whom I greatly love, to catch one fi&s;h. My only con&s;olation is to think you happier than my&s;elf, and to be|gin to envy you, which is next to hating you (an excellent remedy for love.) How comes it that Providence has been &s;o unkind to me (who am a greater object of compa&s;&s;ion than any fat man alive) that I am forced to drink wine, while you riot in water, prepar'd with oranges by the hand of the Duche&s;s of Queen&s;berry? that I am condemn'd to live by a high-way &s;ide, like an old Patriarch, receiving all gue&s;ts, where my portico (as Virgil has it)

while you are wrapt into the Idalian Groves, &s;prinkled with ro&s;e-water, and live in burrage, balm, and burnet up to the chin, with the Du|che&s;s of Queen&s;berry? that I am doom'd to the drudgery of dining at court with the ladies in waiting at Wind&s;or, while you are happily ba|ni&s;h'd with the Duche&s;s of Queen&s;berry? So partial is fortune in her di&s;pen&s;ations! for I de|&s;erved ten times more to be bani&s;h'd than you, and I know &s;ome Ladies who merit it better than even her Grace. After this I mu&s;t not name any, who dare do &s;o much for you as to &s;end you their &s;ervices. But one there is, who exhorts me often to write to you, I &s;uppo&s;e, to prevent or excu&s;e her not doing it her&s;elf; &s;he &s;eems (for that is all I'll &s;ay for a courtier) to wi&s;h you mighty well.

<P>I Am &s;omething like the &s;un at this &s;ea&s;on, withdrawing from the world, but meaning it mighty well, and re&s;olving to &s;hine whenever I can again.

I am grown too faint to do any good, or to give any plea|&s;ure. I not only, as Dryden finely &s;ays, feel my notes decay as a poet, but feel my &s;pirits flag as a companion, and &s;hall return again to where I fir&s;t began, my books. I have been putting my library in order, and enlarging the chimney in it, with equal intention to warm my mind and body (if I can) to &s;ome life. A friend (a woman-friend, God help me!) with whom I have &s;pent three or four hours a day the&s;e fifteen years, advi&s;ed me to pa&s;s more time in my &s;tudies: I reflected, &s;he mu&s;t have found &s;ome rea&s;on for this admonition, and conclud|ed &s;he would complete all her kindne&s;&s;es to me by returning me to the employment I am fit|te&s;t for; conver&s;ation with the dead, the old, and the worm-eaten.</P>
<P>Judge therefore if I might not treat you as a beatify'd &s;pirit, comparing your life with my &s;tupid &s;tate. For as to my living at Wind&s;or with the ladies, &amp;c. it is all a dream; I was there but two nights, and all the day out of that company. I &s;hall certainly make as little court

That de&s;ire was, to fix and pre&s;erve a few la&s;ting, dependable friend&s;hips: and the accidents which have di&s;appointed me in it, have put a period to all my aims.

<P>SIR Clem. Cottrel tells me you will &s;hortly come to town. We begin to want com|fort in a few friends about us, while the winds whi&s;tle, and the waters roar. The &s;un gives us a parting look, but 'tis but a cold one; we are ready to change tho&s;e di&s;tant favours of a lofty beauty, for a gro&s;s material fire that warms and comforts more. I wi&s;h you could be here till your family come to town: you'll live more innocently, and kill fewer harmle&s;s creatures, nay none, except by your proper deputy, the butcher. It is fit for con&s;cience &s;ake, that you &s;hould come to town, and that the Duche&s;s &s;hould &s;tay in the country, where no innocents of another &s;pecies may &s;uffer by her. I hope &s;he never goes to church: the Duke &s;hould lock you both up, and le&s;s harm would be done. I advi&s;e you to make man your game, hunt and beat about here for coxcombs, and tru&s;s up Rogues in Satire: I fancy they'll turn to a good account, if you can produce them fre&s;h, or make them keep: and their relations will come, and buy their bodies of you.</P>

<P>I Am at la&s;t return'd from my Somer&s;et&s;hire expedition, but &s;ince my return I cannot &s;o much boa&s;t of my health as before I went, for I am frequently out of order with my colical complaints, &s;o as to make me unea&s;y and di&s;pi|rited, tho' not to any violent degree. The re|ception we met with, and the little excur&s;ions we made were every way agreeable. I think the country abounds with beautiful pro&s;pects. Sir William Wyndham is at pre&s;ent amu&s;ing him&s;elf with &s;ome real improvements, and a great many vi&s;ionary ca&s;tles.

<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>Decemb. 16, 1731.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I Am a&s;toni&s;h'd at the complaints occa&s;ion'd by a late Epi&s;tle to the Earl of Burlington; and I &s;hould be afflicted were there the lea&s;t ju&s;t ground for them. Had the writer attack'd Vice, at a time when it is not only tolerated but triumphant, and &s;o far from being conceal'd as a Defect, that it is proclaimed with o&s;tentation as a Merit; I &s;hould have been apprehen&s;ive of the con&s;equence: Had he &s;atirized Game&s;ters of a hundred thou&s;and pounds fortune, acquir'd by &s;uch methods as are in daily practice, and almo&s;t univer&s;ally encouraged: had he over|warmly defended the Religion of his country, again&s;t &s;uch books as come from every pre&s;s, are publickly vended in every &s;hop, and greedi|ly bought by almo&s;t every rank of men; or had he called our excellent weekly writers by the &s;ame names which they openly be&s;tow on the greate&s;t men in the Mini&s;try, and out of the Mini&s;try, for which they are all unpuni&s;hed, and mo&s;t rewarded: In any of the&s;e ca&s;es, in|deed,
<PB N="190" REF="206">
deed, I might have judged him too pre&s;umptu|ous, and perhaps have trembled for his ra&s;h|ne&s;s.</P>
<P>I could not but hope better for this &s;mall and mode&s;t Epi&s;tle, which attacks no one Vice what&s;oever; which deals only in Folly, and not Folly in general, but a &s;ingle &s;pecies of it; that only branch, for the oppo&s;ite excellency to which, the Noble Lord to whom it is written mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be celebrated. I fancied it might e&s;cape cen&s;ure, e&s;pecially &s;eeing how ten|derly the&s;e Follies are treated, and really le&s;s ac|cu&s;ed than apologized for.
<Q><L>Yet hence the Poor are cloath'd, the Hungry fed,</L>
<L>Health to him&s;elf, and to his Infants Bread</L>
<L>The Lab'rer bears.</L></Q>
Is this &s;uch a crime, that to impute it to a man mu&s;t be a grievous offence? 'Tis an innocent Folly, and much more beneficent than the want of it; for ill Ta&s;te employs more hands, and diffu&s;es expence more than a good one. Is it a moral defect? No, it is but a natural one; a want of ta&s;te. It is what the be&s;t good man living may be liable to. The worthie&s;t Peer may live exemplarily in an ill-favour'd hou&s;e, and the be&s;t reputed citizen be plea&s;ed with a vile garden. I thought (I &s;ay) the author had the common liberty to ob&s;erve a defect, and to
<PB N="191" REF="207">
compliment a friend for a quality that di&s;tin|gui&s;hes him: which I know not how any qua|lity &s;hould do, if we were not to remark that it was wanting in others.</P>
<P>But, they &s;ay, the &s;atire is per&s;onal. I thought it could not be &s;o, becau&s;e all its reflections are on things. His reflections are not on the man, but his hou&s;e, garden, &amp;c. Nay, he re&s;pects (as one may &s;ay) the Per&s;ons of the Gladiator, the Nile, and the Triton: he is only &s;orry to &s;ee them (as he might be to &s;ee any of his friends) ridiculous by being in the wrong place, and in bad company. Some fancy, that to &s;ay, a thing is Per&s;onal, is the &s;ame as to &s;ay, it is Inju&s;t, not con&s;idering, that nothing can be Ju&s;t that is not per&s;onal. I am afraid that <Q>&startq;all &s;uch writings and di&s;cour&s;es as touch no man, will mend no man.&endq;</Q> The good-natured, indeed, are apt to be alarmed at any thing like &s;atire; and the guilty readily concur with the weak for a plain rea&s;on, becau&s;e the vicious look upon fol|ly as their &s;rontier:
<Q><L>Jam proximus ardet</L>
<L>Ucalegon.</L></Q>
No wonder tho&s;e who know ridicule belongs to them, find an inward con&s;olation in removing it from them&s;elves as far as they can; and it is never &s;o far, as when they can get it fixed on the be&s;t cha|racters.
<PB N="192" REF="208">
No wonder tho&s;e who are Food for Sa|tiri&s;ts &s;hould rail at them as creatures of prey; every bea&s;t born for our u&s;e would be ready to call a man &s;o.</P>
<P>I know no remedy, unle&s;s people in our age would as little frequent the theatres, as they begin to do the churches; unle&s;s comedy were for&s;aken, &s;atire &s;ilent, and every man left to do what &s;eems good in his own eyes, as if there were no King, no Prie&s;t, no Poet, in I&s;rael.</P>
<P>But I find my&s;elf obliged to touch a point, on which I mu&s;t be more &s;erious; it well de|&s;erves I &s;hould: I mean the malicious applica|tion of the character of Timon, which, I will boldly &s;ay, they would impute to the per&s;on the mo&s;t different in the world from a Man|hater, to the per&s;on who&s;e ta&s;te and encourage|ment of wit have often been &s;hewn in the righte&s;t place. The author of that epi&s;tle mu&s;t certainly think &s;o, if he has the &s;ame opinion of his own merit as authors generally have; for he has been di&s;tingui&s;hed by this very per&s;on.</P>
<P>Why, in God's name, mu&s;t a Portrait, ap|parently collected from twenty different men, be applied to one only? Has it his eye? no, it is very unlike. Has it his no&s;e or mouth? no, they are totally differing. What then, I be&s;eech you? Why, it has the mole on his chin. Very
<PB N="193" REF="209">
well; but mu&s;t the picture therefore be his, and has no other man that blemi&s;h?</P>
<P>Could there be a more melancholy in&s;tance how much the ta&s;te of the public is vitiated, and turns the mo&s;t &s;alutary and &s;ea&s;onable phy|&s;ic into poi&s;on, than if amid&s;t the blaze of a thou&s;and bright qualities in a great man, they &s;hould only remark there is a &s;hadow about him; as what eminence is without? I am con|fident the author was incapable of imputing any &s;uch to one, who&s;e whole life (to u&s;e his own expre&s;&s;ion in print of him) is a <HI>continued &s;eries</HI> of <HI>good</HI> and <HI>generous actions.</HI></P>
<P>I know no man who would be more con|cerned, if he gave the lea&s;t pain or offence to any innocent per&s;on; and none who would be le&s;s concerned, if the &s;atire were challenged by any one at whom he would really aim it. If ever that happens, I dare engage, he will own it, with all the freedom of one who&s;e cen&s;ures are ju&s;t, and who &s;ets his name to them.</P>

<DATELINE><DATE>March 7, 1731.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>THE clamour rais'd about my Epi&s;tle to you, could not give me &s;o much pain, as I receiv'd plea&s;ure in &s;eeing the general zeal of the world in the cau&s;e of a Great man who is beneficent, and the particular warmth of your Lord&s;hip in that of a private man who is inno|cent.</P>
<P>It was not the Poem that de&s;erv'd this from you; for as I had the honour to be your Friend, I could not treat you quite like a Poet: but &s;ure the writer de&s;erv'd more candor, even from tho&s;e who knew him not, than to promote a re|port, which in regard to that noble per&s;on, was impertinent; in regard to me, villainous. Yet I had no great cau&s;e to wonder, that a charac|ter belonging to twenty &s;hould be applied to one; &s;ince, by that means, nineteen would e&s;|cape the ridicule.</P>
<P>I was too well content with my knowledge of that noble per&s;on's opinion in this affair, to trouble the public about it. But &s;ince Malice and Mi&s;take are &s;o long a dying, I have taken the opportunity of a third edition to declare his
<PB N="195" REF="211">
belief, not only of my innocence, but of their malignity; of the former of which my own heart is as con&s;cious, as, I fear, &s;ome of theirs mu&s;t be of the latter. His humanity feels a concern for the Injury done to me, while his greatne&s;s of mind can bear with indifference the in&s;ult of|fer'd to him&s;elf <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Alludes to the letter the Duke of Ch* wrote to Mr. Pope on this occa&s;ion. <BIBL>P.</BIBL></NOTE>.</P>
<P>However, my Lord, I own, that critics of this &s;ort can intimidate me, nay half incline me to write no more: That would be making the Town a compliment which, I think, it de&s;erves; and which &s;ome, I am &s;ure, would take very kindly. This way of Satire is dangerous, as long as &s;lander rais'd by fools of the lowe&s;t rank, can find any countenance from tho&s;e of a higher.

I will therefore leave my betters in the quiet po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion of their Idols, their Groves, and their High|places; and change my &s;ubject from their pride to their meanne&s;s, from their vanities to their mi|&s;eries: and, as the only certain way to avoid mi&s;|con&s;tructions, to le&s;&s;en offence, and not to multi|ply ill-natur'd applications, I may probably, in

<P>Cirence&s;ter.</P>
<P>IT is a true &s;aying, that misfortunes alone prove one's friend&s;hips; they &s;how us not only that of other people for us, but our own for them. We hardly know our&s;elves any otherwi&s;e. I feel my being forced to this Bath-journey as a misfortune; and to follow my own welfare preferably to tho&s;e I love, is indeed a new thing to me: my health has not u&s;ually got the better of my tenderne&s;&s;es and affections. I &s;et out with a heavy heart, wi&s;hing I had done this thing the la&s;t &s;ea&s;on; for every day I defer it, the more I am in danger of that ac|cident which I dread the mo&s;t, my Mother's death (e&s;pecially &s;hould it happen while I am away.) And another Reflection pains me, that I have never, &s;ince I knew you, been &s;o long &s;e|parated from you, as I now mu&s;t be. Me|thinks we live to be more and more &s;trangers, and every year teaches you to live without me:
<PB N="197" REF="213">
This ab&s;ence may, I fear, make my return le&s;s welcome and le&s;s wanted to you, than once it &s;eem'd, even after but a fortnight. Time ought not in rea&s;on to dimini&s;h friend&s;hip, when it confirms the truth of it by experience.</P>
<P>The journey has a good deal di&s;order'd me, notwith&s;tanding my re&s;ting place at Lord Ba|thur&s;t's. My Lord is too much for me, he walks, and is in &s;pirits all day long; I rejoice to &s;ee him &s;o. It is a right di&s;tinction, that I am happier in &s;eeing my friends &s;o many de|grees above me, be it in fortune, health, or plea&s;ures, than I can be in &s;haring either with them: for in the&s;e &s;ort of enjoyments I cannot keep pace with them, any more than I can walk with a &s;tronger man. I wonder to find I am a companion for none but old men, and forget that I am not a young fellow my&s;elf. The wor&s;t is, that reading and writing, which I have &s;till the greate&s;t reli&s;h for, are growing painful to my eyes. But if I can pre&s;erve the good opi|nion of one or two friends, to &s;uch a degree, as to have their indulgence to my weakne&s;&s;es, I will not complain of life: And if I could live to &s;ee you con&s;ult your ea&s;e and quiet, by becoming independent on tho&s;e who will never help you to either, I doubt not of finding the latter part of my life plea&s;anter than the former, or pre&s;ent. My unea&s;ine&s;&s;es of body I can bear;
<PB N="198" REF="214">
my chief unea&s;ine&s;s of mind is in your regard. You have a temper that would make you <HI>ea&s;y</HI> and <HI>beloved</HI> (which is all the happine&s;s one needs to wi&s;h in this world) and content with moderate things. All your point is not to lo&s;e that tem|per by &s;acrificing your&s;elf to others, out of a mi&s;taken tenderne&s;s, which hurts you, and pro|fits not them. And this you mu&s;t do &s;oon, or it will be too late: Habit will make it as hard for you to live independent, as for L&mdash;to live out of a Court.</P>
<P>You mu&s;t excu&s;e me for ob&s;erving what I think any defect in you: You grow too indo|lent, and give things up too ea&s;ily: which would be otherwi&s;e, when you found and felt your&s;elf your own: Spirits would come in, as ill-u&s;age went out. While you live under a kind of perpetual dejection and oppre&s;&s;ion, no|thing at all belongs to you, not your own <HI>Hu|mour,</HI> nor your own <HI>Sen&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>You can't conceive how much you would find re&s;olution ri&s;e, and chearfulne&s;s grow upon you, if you'd once try to live independent for two or three months. I never think tenderly of you but this comes acro&s;s me, and therefore ex|cu&s;e my repeating it, for whenever I do not, I di&s;&s;emble half that I think of you: Adieu, pray write, and be particular about your health.</P>

or the things they can never be the better for. Very few can receive plea&s;ure or advantage from wit which they &s;eldom ta&s;te, or learning which they &s;eldom under&s;tand: much le&s;s from the quality, high birth, or &s;hining cir|cum&s;tances of tho&s;e to whom they profe&s;s e&s;|teem, and who will always remember how much they are their Inferiors. But Humanity and &s;ociable virtues are what every creature wants every day, and &s;till wants more the long|er he lives, and mo&s;t the very moment he dies. It is ill travelling either in a ditch or on a terras; we &s;hould walk in the common way, where others are continually pa&s;&s;ing on the &s;ame level, to make the journey of life &s;upportable by bear|ing one another company in the &s;ame circum|&s;tances.&mdash;Let me know how I may convey over the Ody&s;&s;es for your amu&s;ement in your jour|ney, that you may compare your own travels with tho&s;e of Uly&s;&s;es: I am &s;ure yours are un|dertaken upon a more di&s;intere&s;ted, and therefore a more heroic motive.

<P>I Never am unmindful of tho&s;e I think &s;o well of as your&s;elf; their number is not &s;o great as to confound one's memory. Nor ought you to decline writing to me, upon an imagination, that I am much employ'd by other people. For tho' my hou&s;e is like the hou&s;e of a Patriarch of old, &s;tanding by the highway &s;ide and re|ceiving all travellers, neverthele&s;s I &s;eldom go to bed without the reflection, that one's chief bu&s;ine&s;s is to be really at home: and I agree with you in your opinion of company, amu&s;e|ments, and all the &s;illy things which mankind
<PB N="204" REF="220">
would fain make plea&s;ures of, when in truth they are labour and &s;orrow.</P>
<P>I condole with you on the death of your Re|lation, the E. of C. as on the fate of a mortal man: E&s;teem I never had for him, but con|cern and humanity I had: the latter was due to the infirmity of his la&s;t period, tho' the for|mer was not due to the triumphant and vain part of his cour&s;e. He certainly knew him&s;elf be&s;t at la&s;t, and knew be&s;t the little value of others, who&s;e neglect of him, whom they &s;o gro&s;ly follow'd and flatter'd in the former &s;cene of his life, &s;hew'd them as worthle&s;s as they could imagine him to be, were he all that his wor&s;t enemies believ'd of him: For my own part, I am &s;orry for his death, and wi&s;h he had lived long enough to &s;ee &s;o much of the faith|le&s;&s;ne&s;s of the world, as to have been above the mad ambition of governing &s;uch wretches as he mu&s;t have found it to be compos'd of.</P>
<P>Tho' you could have no great value for this Great man, yet acquaintance it&s;elf, the cu&s;tom of &s;eeing the face, or entering under the roof, of one that walks along with us in the common way of the world, is enough to create a wi&s;h at lea&s;t for his being above ground, and a degree of unea&s;ine&s;s at his removal. 'Tis the lo&s;s of an object familiar to us: I &s;hould hardly care to have an old po&s;t pull'd up, that I remem|ber'd
<PB N="205" REF="221">
ever &s;ince I was a child. And add to this the reflection (in the ca&s;e of &s;uch as were not the be&s;t of their Species) what their condition in another life may be, it is yet a more import|ant motive for our concern and compa&s;&s;ion. To &s;ay the truth, either in the ca&s;e of death or life, almo&s;t every body and every thing is a cau&s;e or object for humanity, even pro&s;perity it&s;elf, and health it&s;elf; &s;o many weak pitiful incidentals attend on them.</P>
<P>I am &s;orry any relation of yours is ill, who|ever it be, for you don't name the per&s;on. But I conclude it is one of tho&s;e to who&s;e hou&s;es, you tell me, you are going, for I know no invi|tation with you is &s;o &s;trong as when any one is in di&s;tre&s;s, or in want of your a&s;&s;i&s;tance: The &s;tronge&s;t proof in the world of this, was your attendance on the late Earl.</P>
<P>I have been very melancholy for the lo&s;s of Mr. Blount. Whoever has any portion of good nature will &s;uffer on the&s;e occa&s;ions; but a good mind rewards its own &s;ufferings. I hope to trouble you as little as po&s;&s;ible, if it be my fate to go before you. I am of old Ennius's mind, <HI>Nemo me decoret lachrymis</HI>&mdash;I am but a <HI>Lodger</HI> here: this is not an abiding city, I am only to &s;tay out my lea&s;e: for what has Perpe|tuity and mortal man to do with each other? But I could be glad you would take up with an

<P>YOU are too humane and con&s;iderate, (things few people can be charged with.) Do not &s;ay you will not expect letters from me; upon my word I can no more forbear writing &s;ometimes to you, than thinking of you. I know the world too well, not to value you who are an example of acting, living, and thinking, above it, and contrary to it.</P>
<P>I thank God for my Mother's unexpected recovery, tho' my hope can ri&s;e no higher than from reprieve to reprieve, the &s;mall addition of a few days to the many &s;he has already &s;een. Yet &s;o &s;hort and tran&s;itory as this light is, it is all I have to warm or &s;hine upon me; and when it is out, there is nothing el&s;e that will live for me, or con&s;ume it&s;elf in my &s;ervice. But I would have you think this is not the chief motive of my concern about her: Gratitude is a
<PB N="207" REF="223">
cheap virtue, one may pay it very punctually, for it co&s;ts us nothing, but our memory of the good done. And I owe her more good, than ever I can pay, or &s;he at this age re|ceive, if I could. I do not think the tran|quillity of the mind ought to be di&s;turbed for many things in this world: but tho&s;e of|fices that are nece&s;&s;ary duties either to our friends or our&s;elves, will hardly prove any breach of it; and as much as they take away from our indolence and ea&s;e of body, will con|tribute to our peace and quiet of mind by the content they give. They often afford the high|e&s;t plea&s;ure; and tho&s;e who do not feel that, will hardly ever find another to match it, let them love them&s;elves ever &s;o dearly. At the &s;ame time it mu&s;t be own'd, one meets with cruel di&s;appointments in &s;eeing &s;o often the be&s;t endeavours ineffectual to make others happy, and very often (what is mo&s;t cruel of all) thro' their own means <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">See Letter XXVII. from Cirence&s;ter.</NOTE>. But &s;till, I affirm, tho&s;e very di&s;appointments of a virtuous man are greater plea&s;ures, than the utmo&s;t gratifications and &s;ucce&s;&s;es of a mere &s;elf-lover.</P>
<P>The great and &s;udden event which has ju&s;t now happened <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">The death of K. George the Fir&s;t, which happened the 11th of June, 1727.</NOTE>, puts the whole world (I mean

It would be worth your while as a Philo&s;opher, to be bu&s;y in the&s;e ob&s;ervations, and to come hither to &s;ee the fury and bu&s;tle of the Bees this hot &s;ea&s;on, without coming &s;o near as to be &s;tung by them.</P>

<P>AFter the publi&s;hing of my Boyi&s;h Letters to Mr. Cromwell, you will not wonder if I &s;hould for&s;wear writing a letter again while I live; &s;ince I do not corre&s;pond with a friend upon the terms of any other free &s;ubject of this kingdom. But to you I can never be &s;ilent, or re&s;erved; and, I am &s;ure, my opinion of your heart is &s;uch, that I could open mine to you in no manner which I could fear the whole world
<PB N="209" REF="225">
&s;hould know. I could publi&s;h my own heart too, I will venture to &s;ay, for any mi&s;chief or malice there is in it: but a little too much folly or weakne&s;s might (I fear) appear, to make &s;uch a &s;pectacle either in&s;tructive or agreeable to others.</P>
<P>I am reduced to beg of all my acquaintance to &s;ecure me from the like u&s;age for the future, by returning me any letters of mine which they may have pre&s;erved; that I may not be hurt, after my death, by that which was the happi|ne&s;s of my life, their partiality and affection to me.</P>
<P>I have nothing of my&s;elf to tell you, only that I have had but indifferent health. I have not made a vi&s;it to London: Curio&s;ity and the love of Di&s;&s;ipation die apace in me. I am not glad nor &s;orry for it, but I am very &s;orry for tho&s;e who have nothing el&s;e to live on.</P>
<P>I have read much, but writ no more. I have &s;mall hopes of doing good, no vanity in writ|ing, and little ambition to plea&s;e a world not very candid or de&s;erving. If I can pre&s;erve the good opinion of a few friends, it is all I can expect, con&s;idering how little good I can do even to them to merit it. Few people have your candour, or are &s;o willing to think well of another from whom they receive no benefit, and gratify no vanity. But of all the &s;oft &s;en|&s;ations,
<PB N="210" REF="226">
the greate&s;t plea&s;ure is to give and re|ceive mutual Tru&s;t. It is by Belief and firm Hope, that men are made happy in this life, as well as in the other. My confidence in your good opinion, and dependance upon that of one or two more, is the chief cordial drop I ta&s;te, amid&s;t the In&s;ipid, the Di&s;agreeable, the Cloying, or the Dead-&s;weet, which are the com|mon draughts of life. Some plea&s;ures are too pert, as well as others too flat, to be reli&s;h'd long: and vivacity in &s;ome ca&s;es is wor&s;e than dul|ne&s;s. Therefore indeed for many years I have not cho&s;en my companions for any of the qua|lities in fa&s;hion, but almo&s;t intirely for that which is the mo&s;t out-of-fa&s;hion, &s;incerity. Be|fore I am aware of it, I am making your pane|gyric, and perhaps my own too, for next to po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the be&s;t of qualities is the e&s;teeming and di&s;tingui&s;hing tho&s;e who po&s;&s;e&s;s it. I truly love and value you, and &s;o I &s;top &s;hort.</P>

<P>I Pre&s;ume you may before this time be re|turned, from the contemplation of many Beauties, animal and vegetable, in Gardens;
<PB N="211" REF="227">
and po&s;&s;ibly &s;ome rational, in Ladies; to the better enjoyment of your own at Bevis-Mount. I hope, and believe, all you have &s;een will on|ly contribute to it. I am not &s;o fond of mak|ing compliments to Ladies as I was twenty years ago, or I would &s;ay there are &s;ome very rea&s;onable, and one in particular there. I think you happy, my Lord, in being at lea&s;t half the year almo&s;t as much your own ma&s;ter as I am mine the whole year: and with all the di&s;ad|vantageous incumbrances of quality, parts, and honour, as meer a gardener, loiterer, and la|bourer, as he who never had Titles, or from whom they are taken. I have an eye in the la&s;t of the&s;e glorious appellations to the &s;tyle of a Lord degraded or attainted: methinks they give him a better title than they deprive him of, in calling him Labourer: <HI>Agricultura,</HI> &s;ays Tully, <HI>proxima Sapientiae,</HI> which is more than can be &s;aid, by mo&s;t modern Nobility, of Grace or Right Honourable, which are often <HI>proxima Stultitiae.</HI> The Great Turk, you know, is of|ten a Gardener, or of a meaner trade: and are there not (my Lord) &s;ome circum&s;tances in which you would re&s;emble the Great Turk? The two Paradi&s;es are not ill connected, of Gardens and Gallantry; and &s;ome there are (not to name my Lord B.) who pretend they

are both to be had, even in this life, without turning Mu&s;&s;elmen.</P>
<P>We have as little politics here within a few miles of the Court (nay perhaps at the Court) as you at Southampton; and our Mini&s;ters, I dare &s;ay, have le&s;s to do. Our weekly hi&s;to|ries are only full of the fea&s;ts given to the Queen and Royal Family by their &s;ervants, and the long and laborious walks her maje&s;ty takes every morning. Yet if the graver Hi&s;torians hereafter &s;hall be &s;ilent of this year's events, the amorous and anecdotical may make po&s;terity &s;ome amends, by being furni&s;hed with the gal|lantries of the Great at home; and 'tis &s;ome comfort, that if the Men of the next age do not read of us, the Women may.</P>
<P>From the time you have been ab&s;ent, I've not been to wait on a certain great man, thro' mode&s;ty, thro' idlene&s;s, and thro' re&s;pect.

<P>I Mu&s;t confe&s;s that in going to Lord Cob|ham's, I was not led by curio&s;ity. I went thither to &s;ee what I had &s;een, and what I was &s;ure to like.</P>
<P>I had the idea of tho&s;e gardens &s;o fix'd in my imagination by many de&s;criptions, that no|thing &s;urprized me; Immen&s;ity and Van Brugh appear in the whole, and in every part. Your joining in your letter animal and vegetable beau|ty, makes me u&s;e this expre&s;&s;ion: I confe&s;s the &s;tately Sachari&s;&s;a at Stow, but am content with my little Amoret.</P>
<P>I thought you indeed more knowing upon the &s;ubject, and wonder at your mi&s;take: why will you imagine women in&s;en&s;ible to Prai&s;e, much le&s;s to yours? I have &s;een them more than once turn from their Lover to their Flat|terer. I am &s;ure the Farmere&s;s at Bevis in her highe&s;t mortifications, in the middle of her Lent <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">The Counte&s;s of Peterborow, a Roman-catholic.</NOTE>, would feel emotions of vanity, if &s;he knew you gave her the character of a rea&s;on|able woman.</P>
<P>You have been guilty again of another mi&s;|take, which hinder'd me &s;howing your letter to

a friend; when you join two ladies in the &s;ame compliment, tho' you gave to both the beauty of Venus and the wit of Minerva, you would plea&s;e neither.</P>
<P>If you had put me into the Dunciad, I could not have been more di&s;po&s;ed to critici&s;e your letter. What, Sir, do you bring it in as a re|proach, or as a thing uncommon to a Court, to be without Politics? With politics indeed the Richlieu's and &s;uch folks have brought about great things in former days; but what are they, Sir, who, without policy, in our times, can make ten Treaties in a year, and &s;ecure everla&s;ting Peace?</P>
<P>I can no longer di&s;agree with you, tho' in je&s;t. Oh how heartily I join with you in your contempt for Excellency and Grace, and in your E&s;teem of that mo&s;t noble title, Loiterer. If I were a man of many plums, and a good heathen, I would dedicate a Temple to Lazi|ne&s;s: No man &s;ure could blame my choice of &s;uch a Deity, who con&s;iders, that, when I have been fool enough to take pains, I always met with &s;ome wi&s;e man able to undo my labours.</P>

El&s;e was it not very vexatious, to deny me to commend two women at a time? It is true, my Lord, you know women as well as men: but &s;ince you certainly love them better, why are you &s;o uncharitable in your opinion of them? Surely one Lady may allow another to have the thing &s;he her&s;elf lea&s;t values, Rea&s;on, when Beauty is unconte&s;ted. Venus her&s;elf could allow Mi|nerva to be Godde&s;s of Wit, when Paris gave her the apple (as the fool her&s;elf thought) on a better account.

<P>And whereas it is apparent, in this prote&s;t|ant land, mo&s;t e&s;pecially under the care of divine providence, that nothing can &s;ucceed or come to a happy i&s;&s;ue but by Bribery; there|fore let me know what he expects to comply with my de&s;ires, and it &s;hall be remitted unto him.</P>
<P>For tho' I would not corrupt any man for the whole world, yet a benevolence may be given without any offence to con&s;cience; every one mu&s;t confe&s;s, that gratification and corrup|tion are two di&s;tinct terms; nay at wor&s;t many good men hold, that for a good end, &s;ome very naughty mea&s;ures may be made u&s;e of.</P>
<P>But, Sir, I mu&s;t give you &s;ome good news in relation to my&s;elf, becau&s;e, I know, you wi&s;h me well; I am cur'd of &s;ome di&s;ea&s;es in my old age, which tormented me very much in my youth.</P>

<P>Now, Sir, let what will happen, I keep my|&s;elf in temper: As I have no flattering hopes, &s;o I bani&s;h all u&s;ele&s;s fears; but as to the things of this world, I find my&s;elf in a condition be|yond expectation; it being evident from a late Parliamentary inquiry, that I have as much ready money, as much in the funds, and as great a per&s;onal e&s;tate, as Sir Robert S-tt-n.</P>

<P>I Never knew or heard of any per&s;on &s;o vo|latile, and &s;o fix'd as your Lord&s;hip: You, while your imagination is carrying you through every corner of the world, where you have or have not been, can at the &s;ame time remember to do offices of favour and kindne&s;s to the mean|e&s;t of your friends; and in all the &s;cenes you have pa&s;&s;ed, have not been able to attain that one quality peculiar to a great man, of forget|ting every thing but injuries. Of this I am a living witne&s;s again&s;t you; for being the mo&s;t in&s;ignificant of all your old humble &s;ervants, you were &s;o cruel as never to give me time to a&s;k a favour, but prevented me in doing what|ever you thought I de&s;ired, or could be for my credit or advantage.</P>

<P>That this Letter may be all of a piece, I'll fill the re&s;t with an account of a con&s;ultation lately held in my neighbourhood about de&s;ign|ing a princely garden. Several Critics were of &s;everal opinions: One declar'd he would not have too much Art in it; for my notion (&s;aid he) of gardening is, that it is only &s;weeping Nature <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">An Expre&s;&s;ion of Sir T.

The&s;e (my Lord) are our Men of Ta&s;te, who pretend to prove it by ta&s;ting little or nothing. Sure &s;uch a Ta&s;te is like &s;uch a &s;tomach, not a good one, but a weak one. We have the &s;ame &s;ort of Critics in poetry; one is fond of nothing but Heroics, another cannot reli&s;h Tragedies, another hates Pa&s;torals, all lit|tle Wits delight in Epigrams.

<P>I A&s;&s;ure you I am glad of your letter, and have long wanted nothing but the permi&s;&s;ion you now give me, to be plain and unre&s;erved upon this head. I wrote to you concerning it long &s;ince; but a friend of yours and mine was of opinion, it was taking too much upon me, and more than I could be entitled to by the mere merit of long acquaintance, and good will. I have not a thing in my heart relating to any friend, which I would not, in my own
<PB N="229" REF="245">
nature, declare to all mankind. The truth is what you gue&s;s; I could not e&s;teem your con|duct, to an object of mi&s;ery &s;o near you as Mrs.&mdash;, and I have often hinted it to your|&s;elf: The truth is, I cannot yet e&s;teem it for any rea&s;on I am able to &s;ee. But this I pro|mi&s;e, I acquit you as far as your own mind ac|quits you. I have now no further cau&s;e of complaint, for the unhappy Lady gives me now no farther pain; &s;he is no longer an object ei|ther of yours or my compa&s;&s;ion; the hard&s;hips done her, are lodg'd in the hands of God, nor has any man more to do in them, except the per&s;ons concern'd in occa&s;ioning them.</P>
<P>As for the interruption of our Corre&s;pond|ence, I am &s;orry you &s;eem to put the Te&s;t of my friend&s;hip upon that, becau&s;e it is what I am di&s;qualified from toward my other acquaint|ance, with whom I cannot hold any frequent commerce. I'll name you the ob&s;tacles which I can't &s;urmount: want of health, want of time, want of good eyes; and one yet &s;tronger than them all, I write not upon the terms of other men. For however glad I might be, of expre&s;s|ing my re&s;pect, opening my mind, or venting my concerns, to my private friends; I hardly dare while there are Curlls in the world. If you plea&s;e to reflect either on the impertinence of weak admirers, the malice of low enemies, the
<PB N="230" REF="246">
avarice of mercenary Book&s;ellers, or the &s;illy curio&s;ity of people in general; you'll confe&s;s I have &s;mall rea&s;on to indulge corre&s;pondencies: in which too I want materials, as I live alto|gether out of town, and have ab&s;tracted my mind (I hope) to better things than common news. I wi&s;h my friends would &s;end me back tho&s;e forfeitures of my di&s;cretion, commit to my ju&s;tice what I tru&s;ted only to their indul|gence, and return me at the year's end tho&s;e trifling letters, which can be to them but a day's amu&s;ement, but to me may prove a di&s;|credit as la&s;ting and exten&s;ive, as the afore&s;aid weak admirers, mean enemies, mercenary &s;crib|lers, or curious &s;impletons, can make it.</P>
<P>I come now to a particular you complain of, my not an&s;wering your que&s;tion about &s;ome Party-papers, and their authors. This indeed I could not tell you, becau&s;e I never was, or will be privy to &s;uch papers: And if by ac|cident, thro' my acquaintance with any of the writers, I had known a thing they con|ceal'd; I &s;hould certainly never be the Reporter of it.</P>
<P>For my waiting on you at your country|hou&s;e, I have often wi&s;h'd it; it was my com|pliance to a &s;uperior duty that hinder'd me, and one which you are too good a Chri&s;tian to
<PB N="231" REF="247">
wi&s;h I &s;hould have broken, having never ven|tur'd to leave my mother (at her great age) for more than a week, which is too little for &s;uch a journey.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, I mu&s;t acquit my&s;elf of any act or thought, in prejudice to the regard I owe you, as &s;o long and obliging an acquaint|ance and corre&s;pondent. I am &s;ure I have all the good wi&s;hes for your&s;elf and your family, that become a friend: There is no accident that can happen to your advantage, and no action that can redound to your credit, which I &s;hould not be ready to extol, or to rejoice in. And there|fore I beg you to be a&s;&s;ured, I am in di&s;po&s;i|tion and will, tho' not &s;o much as I would be in te&s;timonies or writing,</P>

'Tis but in a very narrow circle that Friend&s;hip walks in this world, and I care not to tread out of it more than I needs mu&s;t; knowing well, it is but to two or three (if quite &s;o many) that any man's welfare, or me|mory, can be of con&s;equence: The re&s;t, I be|lieve, I may forget, and be pretty certain they are already even, if not before-hand with me.</P>
<P>Life, after the fir&s;t warm heats are over, is all down-hill: and one almo&s;t wi&s;hes the jour|ney's end, provided we were &s;ure but to lie down ea&s;y, whenever the Night &s;hall over|take us.</P>

<P>I Little doubt of your kind concern for me, nor of that of the Lady you mention. I have nothing to repay my friends with at pre|&s;ent, but prayers and good wi&s;hes. I have the &s;atisfaction to find that I am as officiou&s;ly &s;erv'd by my friends, as he that has thou&s;ands to leave in legacies; be&s;ides the a&s;&s;urance of their &s;in|cerity. God almighty has made my bodily di&s;|tre&s;s as ea&s;y as a thing of that nature can be. I

have found &s;ome relief, at lea&s;t &s;ometimes, from the air of this place. My nights are bad, but many poor creatures have wor&s;e.</P>
<P>As for you, my good friend, I think &s;ince our fir&s;t acquaintance there have not been any of tho&s;e little &s;u&s;picions or jealou&s;ies that often affect the &s;incere&s;t friend&s;hips; I am &s;ure, not on my &s;ide. I mu&s;t be &s;o &s;incere as to own, that though I could not help valuing you for tho&s;e Talents which the world prizes, yet they were not the foundation of my friend&s;hips; they were quite of another &s;ort; nor &s;hall I at pre&s;ent offend you by enumerating them: And I make it my La&s;t Reque&s;t, that you will continue that No|ble Di&s;dain and Abhorrence of Vice, which you &s;eem naturally endued with; but &s;till with a due regard to your own &s;afety; and &s;tudy more to reform than cha&s;ti&s;e, tho' the one can|not be effected without the other.</P>
<P>Lord Bathur&s;t I have always honour'd, for every good quality that a per&s;on of his rank ought to have: Pray, give my re&s;pects and kind|e&s;t wi&s;hes to the family.

<HEAD>LETTER XLVIII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">To Dr. ARBUTHNOT.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>July 26, 1734.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I Thank you for your letter, which has all tho&s;e genuine marks of a good mind by which I have ever di&s;tingui&s;h'd yours, and for which I have &s;o long loved you. Our friend|&s;hip has been con&s;tant; becau&s;e it was ground|ed on good principles, and therefore not only uninterrupted by any Di&s;tru&s;t, but by any Va|nity, much le&s;s any Intere&s;t.</P>
<P>What you recommend to me with the &s;o|lemnity of a La&s;t Reque&s;t, &s;hall have its due weight with me. That di&s;dain and indigna|tion again&s;t Vice, is (I thank God) the only di&s;dain and indignation I have: It is &s;incere, and it will be la&s;ting one. But &s;ure it is as impo&s;&s;ible to have a ju&s;t abhorrence of Vice, without hating the Vicious, as to bear a true love for Virtue, without loving the Good. To reform and not to cha&s;ti&s;e, I am afraid, is im|po&s;&s;ible; and that the be&s;t Precepts, as well as the be&s;t Laws, would prove of &s;mall u&s;e, if there were no Examples to inforce them. To
<PB N="242" REF="258">
attack Vices in the ab&s;tract, without touching Per&s;ons, may be &s;afe fighting indeed, but it is fighting with Shadows. General propo&s;itions are ob&s;cure, mi&s;ty, and uncertain, compar'd with plain, full, and home examples: Precepts only apply to our Rea&s;on, which in mo&s;t men is but weak: Examples are pictures, and &s;trike the Sen&s;es, nay rai&s;e the Pa&s;&s;ions, and call in tho&s;e (the &s;tronge&s;t and mo&s;t general of all mo|tives) to the aid of reformation. Every vici|ous man makes the ca&s;e his own; and that is the only way by which &s;uch men can be af|fected, much le&s;s deterr'd. So that to cha&s;|ti&s;e is to reform. The only &s;ign by which I found my writings ever did any good, or had any weight, has been that they rais'd the anger of bad men. And my greate&s;t comfort, and encouragement to proceed, has been to &s;ee, that tho&s;e who have no &s;hame, and no fear of any thing el&s;e, have appear'd touch'd by my Satires.</P>
<P>As to your kind concern for my Safety, I can gue&s;s what occa&s;ions it at this time. Some Characters<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">The Character of Sporus in the Epi&s;tle to Dr. Ar|buthnot.</NOTE> I have drawn are &s;uch, that if there be any who de&s;erve them, 'tis evidently a &s;er|vice to mankind to point tho&s;e men out; yet &s;uch as, if all the world gave them, none, I think, will own they take to them&s;elves. But
<PB N="243" REF="259">
if they &s;hould, tho&s;e of whom all the world think in &s;uch a manner, mu&s;t be men I cannot fear. Such in particular as have the meanne&s;s to do mi&s;chiefs in the dark, have &s;eldom the cou|rage to ju&s;tify them in the face of day; the ta|lents that make a Cheat or a Whi&s;perer, are not the &s;ame that qualify a man for an In&s;ulter; and as to private villainy, it is not &s;o &s;afe to join in an A&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination, as in a Libel Libel <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">See the following Letter to a noble Lord.</NOTE>. I will con&s;ult my &s;afety &s;o far as I think becomes a prudent man: but not &s;o far as to omit any thing which I think becomes an hone&s;t one. As to per&s;onal attacks beyond the law, every man is liable to them: as for danger within the law, I am not guilty enough to fear any. For the good opinion of all the world, I know, it is not to be had: for that of worthy men, I hope, I &s;hall not forfeit it: for that of the Great, or tho&s;e in power, I may wi&s;h I had it; but if thro' mi&s;repre&s;entations (too common about per&s;ons in that &s;tation) I have it not, I &s;hall be &s;orry, but not mi&s;erable in the want of it.</P>
<P>It is certain, much freer Satiri&s;ts than I, have enjoy'd the encouragement and protection of the Princes under whom they lived. Augu&s;tus and Maecenas made Horace their companion, though he had been in arms on the &s;ide of
<PB N="244" REF="260">
Brutus; and, allow me to remark, it was out of the &s;uffering Party too, that they favour'd and di&s;tingui&s;h'd Virgil. You will not &s;u&s;pect me of comparing my&s;elf with Virgil and Horace, nor even with another Court-favourite, Boi|leau <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">See Letter c111. to Mr. Warburton.</NOTE>. I have always been too mode&s;t to ima|gine my Panegyrics were Incen&s;e worthy of a Court; and that, I hope, will be thought the true rea&s;on why I have never offer'd any. I would only have ob&s;erv'd, that it was under the great|e&s;t Princes and be&s;t Mini&s;ters, that moral Sa|tiri&s;ts were mo&s;t encouraged; and that then Poets exerci&s;ed the &s;ame juri&s;diction over the Follies, as Hi&s;torians did over the Vices of men. It may al&s;o be worth con&s;idering, whether Au|gu&s;tus him&s;elf makes the greater figure, in the writings of the former, or of the latter? and whether Nero and Domitian do not appear as ridiculous for their Ta&s;te and Affectation, in Per&s;ius and Juvenal, as odious for their bad Government in Tacitus and Suetonius? In the fir&s;t of the&s;e reigns it was, that Horace was pro|tected and care&s;s'd; and in the latter that Lu|can was put to death, and Juvenal bani&s;h'd.</P>
<P>I would not have &s;aid &s;o much, but to &s;hew you my whole heart on this &s;ubject; and to con|vince you, I am deliberately bent to perform that
<PB N="245" REF="261">
Reque&s;t which you make your la&s;t to me, and to perform it with Temper, Ju&s;tice, and Re&s;o|lution. As your Approbation (being the te&s;ti|mony of a &s;ound head and an hone&s;t heart) does greatly confirm me herein, I wi&s;h you may live to &s;ee the effect it may hereafter have upon me, in &s;omething more de&s;erving of that approbation. But if it be the Will of God, (which, I know, will al&s;o be yours) that we mu&s;t &s;eparate, I hope it will be better for You than it can be for me. You are fitter to live, or to die, than any man I know.

<P>SHE was the daughter of James the &s;e|cond, and of the counte&s;s of Dorche&s;ter, who inherited the Integrity and Virtue of her father with happier fortune. She was married
<PB N="247" REF="263">
fir&s;t to James earl of Angle&s;ey; and &s;econdly, to John Sheffield duke of Buckingham&s;hire and Normanby; with the former &s;he exerci&s;ed the virtues of <HI>Patience</HI> and <HI>Suffering,</HI> as long as there was any hopes of doing good by either; with the latter all other <HI>Conjugal virtues.</HI> The man of fine&s;t &s;en&s;e and &s;harpe&s;t di&s;cernment, &s;he had the happine&s;s to plea&s;e; and in that, found her only plea&s;ure. When he died, it &s;eemed as if his &s;pirit was only breathed into her, to fulfill what he had begun, to perform what he had concerted, and to pre&s;erve and watch over what he had left, <HI>his only &s;on;</HI> in the care of who&s;e Health, the forming of who&s;e Mind, and the improvement of who&s;e Fortune, &s;he acted with the conduct and &s;en&s;e of the Father, &s;often'd, but not overcome, with the tenderne&s;s of the Mother. Her Under&s;tanding was &s;uch as mu&s;t have made a figure, had it been in a man; but the Mode&s;ty of her &s;ex threw a veil over its lu&s;tre, which neverthele&s;s &s;up|pre&s;s'd only the expre&s;&s;ion, not the exertion of it; for her &s;en&s;e was not &s;uperior to her Re&s;o|lution, which, when once &s;he was in the right, pre&s;erv'd her from making it only tran&s;ition to the wrong, the frequent weakne&s;s even of the be&s;t women. She often followed wi&s;e coun&s;el, but &s;ometimes went before it, always with &s;ucce&s;s. She was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a &s;pirit,
<PB N="248" REF="264">
which a&s;&s;i&s;ted her to get the better of tho&s;e ac|cidents which admitted of any redre&s;s, and enabled her to &s;upport outwardly, with decency and dignity, tho&s;e which admitted of none; yet melted inwardly, through almo&s;t her whole life, at a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of melancholy and affect|ing objects, the lo&s;s of all her Children, the misfortunes of <HI>Relations and Friends, public and private,</HI> and the death of tho&s;e who were deare&s;t to her. Her Heart was as compa&s;&s;ion|ate as it was great: her Affections warm even to &s;ollicitude: her Friend&s;hip not violent or jealous, but rational and per&s;evering: her Gra|titude equal and con&s;tant to the living; to the dead boundle&s;s and heroical. What per&s;on &s;o|ever &s;he found worthy of her e&s;teem, &s;he would not give up for any power on earth; and the greate&s;t on earth whom &s;he could not e&s;teem, obtain'd from her no farther tribute than De|cency. Her Good-will was wholly directed by merit, not by accident; not mea&s;ured by the regard they profe&s;s'd for her own de&s;ert, but by her idea of theirs: And as there was no me|rit which &s;he was not able to imitate, there was none which &s;he could envy: therefore her Conver&s;ation was as free from detraction, as her Opinions from prejudice or prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. As her Thoughts were her own, &s;o were her Words; and &s;he was as &s;incere in uttering her
<PB N="249" REF="265">
judgment, as impartial in forming it. She was a &s;afe Companion, many were &s;erv'd, none ever &s;uffered by her acquaintance: inoffen&s;ive, when unprovoked; when provoked, not &s;tupid: But the moment her enemy cea&s;ed to be hurtful, &s;he could cea&s;e to act as an enemy. She was therefore not a bitter but con&s;i&s;tent enemy: (tho' indeed, when forced to be &s;o, the more a fini&s;h'd one for having been long a making.) And her proceeding with ill people was more in a calm and &s;teddy cour&s;e, like Ju&s;tice, than in quick and pa&s;&s;ionate on&s;ets, like Revenge. As for tho&s;e of whom &s;he only thought ill, &s;he con&s;idered them not &s;o much as once to wi&s;h them ill; of &s;uch, her Contempt was great enough to put a &s;top to all other pa&s;&s;ions that could hurt them. Her Love and Aver&s;ion, her Gratitude and Re&s;entment, her E&s;teem and Neglect were equally open and &s;trong, and alter|able only from the alteration of the per&s;ons who created them. Her Mind was too noble to be in&s;incere, and her Heart too hone&s;t to &s;tand in need of it; &s;o that &s;he never found cau&s;e to re|pent her conduct either to a friend or an ene|my. There remains only to &s;peak of her Per|&s;on, which was mo&s;t amiably maje&s;tic, the nice&s;t eye could find no fault in the outward li|neaments of her Face or proportion of her Body; it was &s;uch, as pleas'd wherever &s;he
<PB N="250" REF="266">
had a de&s;ire it &s;hould; yet &s;he never envied that of any other, which might better plea&s;e in ge|neral: In the &s;ame manner, as being content that her merits were e&s;teemed where &s;he de|&s;ired they &s;hould, &s;he never depreciated tho&s;e of any other that were e&s;teemed or preferred el&s;ewhere. For &s;he aimed not at a general love or a general e&s;teem where &s;he was not known; it was enough to be po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of both wherever &s;he was. Having lived to the age of Sixty-two years; not courting Regard, but receiving it from all who knew her; not loving Bu&s;ine&s;s, but di&s;charging it fully where&s;oever duty or friend&s;hip engaged her in it; not following Greatne&s;s, but not declining to pay re&s;pect, as far as was due from independency and di&s;inter|e&s;t; having honourably ab&s;olv'd all the parts of life, &s;he for&s;ook this World, where &s;he had left no act of duty or virtue undone, for that where alone &s;uch acts are rewarded, on the 13th Day of March, 1742-3 <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><Q>&startq;The above Character was written by Mr. Pope &s;ome years before her Grace's Death.&endq;</Q> So the printed Edi|tion.</NOTE>.</P>

<HEAD>An EPISTLE from a Nobleman to a Doctor of Divinity in answer to a Latin Letter in Verse.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>Suppliant your Pardon first I must im|$$lore,</L>
<L>(Dear Doctor) that I've never wrote before:</L>
<L>But in the constant Bustle of a Court,</L>
<L>Betwixt our Forms, our Bus'ne&s;s, and our Sport;</L>
<L>Tho' you may think whole Days are unenjoy'd,</L>
<L>Yet scarce one Moment pa&s;ses unemploy'd.</L>
<L>In the next place, when I declare how long</L>
<L>I've taken leave of Greek or Latin Song;</L>
<L>That all I learn'd from Doc$^r&punc; freind at School,</L>
<L>By Gradus, Lexicon, or Grammar Rule;</L>
<L>Of Saphic, Lyric, or Jambic Odes,</L>
<L>Or Doct^r&punc; King's Machinery of Gods,</L>
<L>Has quite deserted this poor John-Trot Head,</L>
<L>And left plain native English in its stead:</L>
<L>I'm sure your courteous Rev'rence will forgive</L>
<L>The homely Way, in which you now receive</L>
<L><PB N="290" REF="306">
These hearty Thanks, from an illitorate Hand,</L>
<L>For Favours which I barely understand.</L>
<L>You know the Proverb says, that of a Cat,</L>
<L>The Creature's Skin is all that you can get;</L>
<L>So from no Head you ever can receive</L>
<L>More Wit than such a Head has got to give:</L>
<L>Let for this Reason then my gracious Friend</L>
<L>Gracious accept the all I have to send;</L>
<L>Nor wonder that my Brain no more affords,</L>
<L>But recollect the Privilege of Lords;</L>
<L>And when you see me fairly write my Name,</L>
<L>For England's Sake wi&s;h all could do the same.</L>
<L>Nay, I perhaps could not so much have done,</L>
<L>Had I been bred and born an eldest Son.</L>
<L>A noble Father's Heir, spoil'd by his Mother,</L>
<L>Leaves Learning always to his younger Brother;</L>
<L>Who at the Bar must prale to earn a Groat,</L>
<L>Whilst all our Bus'ne&s;s is to dre&s;s and vote.</L>
<L>The very moment therefore I grow great,</L>
<L>A lazy, titled Heir to an Estate,</L>
<L>For fear my Education might bely,</L>
<L>By some mean Badge of Sense, my Quality;</L>
<L><PB N="291" REF="307">
That to good Blood, by old prescriptive Rules,</L>
<L>Gives Right hereditary to be Fools;</L>
<L>I straight began upon a quite new Score,</L>
<L>Neglected all that I had learn'd before;</L>
<L>And not to seem a Novice in my State</L>
<L>Or ignorant what belong'd to being great,</L>
<L>Wish little Judgment, and good store of Pride</L>
<L>I took upon me always to decide:</L>
<L>In every Company was bold and loud,</L>
<L>Behav'd myself as rudely as I could,</L>
<L>And ne'er discours'd of what I understood.</L>
<L>'Tis thus among the Great: if any one</L>
<L>By chance has Wit, so awkardly 'tis shown</L>
<L>That tis a le&s;s Misfortune to have none.</L>
<L>For still he goes on this erroneous Rule,</L>
<L>That no Body with Wit can be a Fool;</L>
<L>Yet by Example, at his own Expence,</L>
<L>Proves one may have it without Common Sense</L>
<L>For, void of Prudence, and $oo vain of Parts,</L>
<L>How oft good Heads have plainer shown bad Hearts?</L>
<L>When in Obscurity perhaps the last</L>
<L>Without the first, had fortunately past.</L>

Thus while to Wit their sole Ambition tends,</L>
<L>(Whilst for one Joke they give up fifty Friends)</L>
<L>Tho ne'er adapted to a manly Use,</L>
<L>But still on Triffles squander'd, or Abuse;</L>
<L>They think the World so blind as to admit,</L>
<L>All Understanding is compris'd in Wit.</L>
<L>That dang'rous Flow of a licentious Brain,</L>

<L>Converts to ill, like Nourishment to Pain.</L>
<L>Perhaps you'll say, to its Excuse inclin'd,</L>
<L>If'$$s an Ill, tis of a pleasing kind.</L>
<L>I grant it such, but still 'tis a Disease,</L>

<L>Luxuriant Branches shew a fertile Root,</L>

<L>So Wit unprun'd, and wanting Judgment's aid,</L>

<L>The Wise avoid&punc; such animals with Care,</L>
<L>And he who laughs the loudest laughs in fear.</L>
<L>True Wit is Rea&s;on in her gayest strain;</L>

Such Pope himself might write who ne'er could think:</L>
