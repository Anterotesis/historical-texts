Peregrine Pickle.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="39" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. XXXIX.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">He embarks for France; is overtaken by a &s;torm;
is &s;urpri&s;ed with the appearance of Pipes; lands
at Calais, and has an affair with the officers of
the cu&s;tom-hou&s;e.</HEAD>
<P>SCARCE had the ve&s;&s;el proceeded two
leagues on the pa&s;&s;age, when the wind
&s;hifting, blew directly in their teeth; &s;o
that they were obliged to haul upon a wind, and
alter their cour&s;e; and the &s;ea running pretty
high at the &s;ame time, our hero, who was below
in his cabbin, began to be &s;queami&s;h, and in con|&s;equence
of the &s;kipper's advice, went upon deck
for the comfort of his &s;tomach; while the go|vernor,
experienced in the&s;e di&s;a&s;ters, &s;lipt into
<PB N="2" REF="11">
bed, where he lay at his ea&s;e, amu&s;ing him&s;elf
with a treati&s;e on the Cycloid, with algebraical
demon&s;trations, which never failed to engage
his imagination in the mo&s;t agreeable manner.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the wind increa&s;ed to a very
hard gale, the ve&s;&s;el pitched with great violence,
the &s;ea wa&s;hed over the decks, the ma&s;ter was
alarmed, the crew were confounded, the pa&s;&s;en|gers
were overwhelmed with &s;ickne&s;s and fear,
and univer&s;al di&s;traction en&s;ued. In the mid&s;t of
this uproar, Peregrine holding fa&s;t by the taffril,
and looking ruefully ahead, the countenance of
Pipes pre&s;ented it&s;elf to his a&s;toni&s;hed view, ri&s;ing
a$ it were from the hold of the &s;hip. At fir&s;t he
imagined it was a fear-formed &s;hadow of his own
brain; though he did not long remain in this er|ror,
but plainly perceived that it was no other
than the real per&s;on of Thomas, who jumping
on the quarter-deck, took charge of the helm,
and dictated to the &s;ailors with as much autho|rity
is if he had been commander of the &s;hip.
The &s;kipper looked upon him as an angel &s;ent to
his a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and the crew &s;oon di&s;covering him
to be a thorough-bred &s;eaman, notwith&s;tanding
his livery-frock, obeyed his orders with &s;uch ala|crity
that in a little time the confu&s;ion vani&s;hed,
and every nece&s;&s;ary &s;tep taken to weather the
gale.</P>
<P>Our young gentleman immediately conceived
the meaning of Tom's appearance on board, and
when the tumult was a little &s;ub&s;ided, went up
and encouraged him to ext him&s;elf for the pre|&s;ervation
of the &s;hip, promi&s;ing to take him again
into his &s;ervice, from which he &s;hould never be
di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, except by his own de&s;ire. This a&s;|&s;urance
had a &s;urpri&s;ing effect upon Pipes, who,
<PB N="3" REF="12">
though he made no manner of reply, thru&s;t the
helm into the ma&s;ter's hand, &s;aying, &startq;Here,
you old bum-boat woman, take hold of the til|ler,
and keep her thus, boy, thus;&endq; and &s;kipped
about the ve&s;&s;el, trimming the &s;ails, and ma|naging
the ropes with &s;uch agility and &s;kill, that
every body on deck &s;tood amazed at his dex|terity.</P>
<P>Mr. Jolter was far from being unconcerned at
the uncommon motion of the ve&s;&s;el, the &s;inging
of the wind, and the uproar which he heard
above him; he looked towards the cabbin-door
with the mo&s;t wi&s;hful expectation, in hope of
&s;eeing &s;ome per&s;on who could give &s;ome account
of the weather, and what was doing upon deck;
but not a &s;oul appeared, and he was too well ac|quainted
with the di&s;po&s;ition of his own bowels
to alter his own attitude in the lea&s;t. When he
had lain a good while in all the agony of &s;u&s;|pence,
the boy tumbled headlong into his apart|ment
with &s;uch noi&s;y ruin, that he believed the
ma&s;t had gone by the board, and &s;tarting upright
in his bed, a&s;ked with all the &s;ymptoms of hor|ror,
what was the cau&s;e of that di&s;turbance?
The boy, half &s;tunned by his fall, an&s;wered in a
dolorous tone, &startq;I'm come to put up the dead-lights.&endq;
At the mention of dead-lights, the
meaning of which he did not under&s;tand, the
poor governor's heart died within him; he &s;hi|vered
with de&s;pair, and his recollection for&s;aking
him, he fell upon his knees in the bed, and fixing
his eyes upon the book which was in his hand, be|gan
to pronounce aloud, with great fervor,
&startq;The time of a compleat o&s;cillation in the cy|cloid,
is to the time in which a body would fail
through the axis of the cycloid DV, as the cir|cumference
<PB N="4" REF="13">
of a circle to its diameter&mdash;&endq; He
would in all likelihood have proceeded with the
demon&s;tration of this propo&s;ition, had he not
been &s;eized with &s;uch a qualm as compelled him
to drop the book, and accommodate him&s;elf to
the emergency of his di&s;temper; he therefore
&s;tretched him&s;elf at full length, and putting up
ejaculations to heaven, began to prepare him&s;elf
for his latter end, when all of a &s;udden the noi&s;e
above was intermitted; and as he could not con|ceive
the cau&s;e of this tremendous &s;ilence, he
imagined that either the men were wa&s;hed over|board,
or that de&s;pairing of &s;afety, they had
cea&s;ed to oppo&s;e the tempe&s;t. While he was
harrowed by this mi&s;erable incertainty, which,
however, was not altogether unenlightened by
&s;ome &s;cattered rays of hope, the ma&s;ter entered
the cabbin, and he a&s;ked with a voice half extin|gui&s;hed
by fear, how matters went upon deck?
The &s;kipper, with a large bottle of brandy ap|plied
to his mouth, an&s;wered in a hollow tone,
&startq;All's over now, ma&s;ter.&endq; Upon which Mr.
Jolter, giving him&s;elf over for lo&s;t, exclaimed
with the utmo&s;t horror, &startq;Lord have mercy up|on
us! Chri&s;t have mercy upon us!&endq; and re|peated
this &s;upplication as it were mechanically,
until the ma&s;ter undeceived him, by explaining the
meaning of what he had &s;aid, and a&s;&s;uring him
that the &s;quall was over.</P>
<P>Such a &s;udden tran&s;ition from fear to joy, oc|ca&s;ioned
a violent agitation both in his mind and
body; and it was a full quarter of an hour before
he recovered the right u&s;e of his organs. By
this time the weather cleared up, the wind be|gan
to blow again from the right corner, and the
&s;pires of Calais appeared at the di&s;tance of five
<PB N="5" REF="14">
leagues; &s;o that the countenances of all on board
were lighted up with joyous expectation; and
Peregrine venturing to go down into the cabbin,
comforted his governor with an account of the
happy turn of their affairs.</P>
<P>Jolter, tran&s;ported with the thought of a &s;peedy
landing, began to launch out in prai&s;e of that
country for which they were bound. He ob|&s;erved,
that France was the land of politene&s;s
and ho&s;pitality, which were con&s;picuous in the
behaviour of all ranks and degrees, from the peer
to the pea&s;ant; that a gentleman and a foreigner,
far from being in&s;$ted and impo&s;ed upon by the
lower cla&s;s of people, as in England, was treated
with the utmo&s;t reverence, candour and re&s;pect;
that their fields were fertile, their climate pure
and healthy, their farmers rich and indu&s;trious,
and the &s;ubjects in general the happie&s;t of men.
He wo$ld have pro&s;ecuted this favourite theme
&s;till farther, had not his pupil been obliged to run
upon deck, in con&s;equence of certain warnings
he received from his &s;tomach.</P>
<P>The &s;kipper &s;eeing his condition, very hone&s;tly
reminded him of the cold ham and fowls, with a
ba&s;ket of wine, which he had ordered to be &s;ent
on board, and a&s;ked if he would have the cloth
laid below. He could not have cho&s;en a more
&s;ea&s;onable opportunity of manife&s;ting his own di&s;|intere&s;tedne&s;s.
Peregrine made wry faces at the
mention of food, bidding him, for Chri&s;t's &s;ake,
talk no more on that &s;ubject. He then de&s;cended
into the cabbin, and put the &s;ame que&s;tion to
Mr. Jolter, who, he knew, entertained the &s;ame
abhorrence for his propo&s;al; and meeting with
the like reception from him, went between decks,
and repeated his courteous proffer to the valet de
<PB N="6" REF="15">
chambre and lacquev, who lay &s;prawling in all
the pangs of a double evacuation, and rejected
his civility with the mo&s;t horrible loathing. Thus
baffled in all his kind endeavours, he ordered his
boy to &s;ecure the provi&s;ion in one of his own
lockers, according to the cu&s;tom of the &s;hip;
and he would have enjoyed a pretty comfortable
booty, had not Pipes interpo&s;ed, and divided the
&s;tore among the &s;ailors, who, he thought, were
mo&s;t de&s;erving of &s;uch indulgence; &s;o that the
&s;kipper had the mertification of &s;eeing his plan
mi&s;eary by his own precipitate conduct; for,
had he held his tongue, no body would have
dreamt of asking for the provi&s;ion, and he would
have po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed his prize in peace.</P>
<P>It being low water when they arrived on the
French coa&s;t, the ve&s;&s;el could not enter the har|bour,
and they were obliged to bring to, and
wait for a boat, which in le&s;s than half an hour
came along-&s;ide from the &s;hore. Mr Jolter
now came upon deck, and &s;nuffing up the French
air with &s;ymptoms of infinite &s;atisfaction, a&s;ked
of the boatmen, with the friendly appellation of
<HI>Mes $word$,</HI> what they mu&s;t have for tran&s;porting
them and their baggage to the pier. But how
was he di&s;concerted, when tho&s;e polite, candid,
rea&s;onable watermen, demanded a Louis d'or for
that &s;ervice! Peregrine, with a &s;arca&s;tic &s;neer,
ob&s;erved, that he already began to perceive the
ju&s;tice of his encomiums on the French; and the
di&s;appointed governor could &s;ay nothing in his
own vindication, but that they were debauched
by their intercour&s;e with the inhabitants of Dover.
His pupil, however, was &s;o much offended at
their extortion, that he ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed to em|ploy
them, even when they abated one half in
<PB N="7" REF="16">
their demand, and &s;wore he would &s;tay on board
till the packet &s;hould be able to enter the har|bour,
rather than encourage &s;uch impo&s;ition.</P>
<P>The ma&s;ter, who in all probability had &s;ome
&s;ort of fellow-feeling with the boatmen, in vain
repre&s;ented, that he could not with &s;afety lie to,
or anchor upon a lee-&s;hore; our hero having con|&s;ulted
Pipes, an&s;wered, that he had hired his ve&s;|&s;el
to tran&s;port him to Calais, and that he would
oblige him to perform what he had undertaken.</P>
<P>The &s;kipper, very much mortified at this pe|remptory
reply, which was not over and above
agreeable to Mr. Jolter, di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the boat, not|with&s;tanding
the &s;ollicitations and conde&s;cen&s;ion
of the watermen, who promi&s;ed to &s;ubmit to the
genero&s;ity of their employer; and running a little
farther in-&s;hore, came to an anchor, and waited
till there was water enough to float them over
the bar. Then they &s;tood in to the harbour, and
our gentleman, with his attendants and baggage,
were landed on the pier by the &s;ailors, whom he
liberally rewarded for their trouble.</P>
<P>He was immediately plied by a great number
of porters, who, like &s;o many hungry wolves,
had hold on his luggage, and began to carry it
off p$ece-meal, without his order or direction.
Incen&s;ed at this officious in&s;olence, he commanded
them to de&s;i&s;t, with many oaths and opprobrious
terms that his anger &s;ugge&s;ted; and perceiving
that one of them did not &s;eem to pay any regard
to what he &s;aid, but marched off with his bur|then,
he &s;natched a cudgel out of his lacquey's
hand, and overtaking the fellow in a twinkling,
brought him to the ground with one blow. He
was in&s;tantly &s;urrounded by the whole congre|gration
of this <HI>canaille,</HI> who re&s;ented the injury
<PB N="8" REF="17">
which their brother had &s;u&s;tained, and would
have taken immediate &s;atisfaction of the aggre&s;&s;or,
had not Pipes, &s;eeing his ma&s;ter involved, brought
the whole crew to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and exerted
him&s;elf &s;o manfully, that the enemy were obliged
to retreat with many marks of defeat, and me|naces
of intere&s;ting the commandant in their quar|rel.
Jolter, who knew and dreaded the power
of the French governor, began to &s;hake with ap|prehen&s;ion,
when he heard their repeated threats;
but they dur&s;t not apply to this magi&s;trate, who,
upon a fair repre&s;entation of the ca&s;e, would
have puni&s;hed them &s;everely for their rapacious
and in&s;olent behaviour; and Peregrine, without
farther mole&s;tation, availed him&s;elf of his own
attendants, who &s;houldered his baggage, and fol|lowed
him to the gate, where they were &s;topt by
the centinels, until their names &s;hould be re|gi&s;tered.</P>
<P>Mr. Jolter, who had undergone this examina|tion
before, re&s;olved to profit by his experience,
and cunningly repre&s;ented his pupil as a young
Engli&s;h lord. This intimation, &s;upported by the
appearance of his equipage, was no &s;ooner com|municated
to the officer, than he turned out the
guard, and ordered his &s;oldiers to re&s;t upon their
arms, while his lord&s;hip pa&s;&s;ed in great &s;tate to
the <HI>Lion d'Argent,</HI> where he took up his lodging
for the night, re&s;olving to &s;et out for Paris next
morning in a po&s;t-chai&s;e.</P>
<P>The governor triumphed greatly in this piece
of complai&s;ance and re&s;pect with which they had
been honoured, and re&s;umed his beloved topic
of di&s;cour&s;e, in applauding the method and &s;ub|ordination
of the French government, which
was better calculated for maintaining order, and
<PB N="9" REF="18">
protecting the people, than any con&s;titution up|on
earth; and of their courteous attention to
&s;trangers, there needed no other proof than the
compliment which had been paid to them, toge|ther
with the governor's connivance at Pere|grine's
employing his own &s;ervants in carrying the
baggage to the inn, contrary to the privilege of
the inhabitants.</P>
<P>While he expatiated with a remarkable degree
of &s;elf-indulgence on this &s;ubject, the valet de
chambre coming into the room, interrupted his
harangue, by telling his ma&s;ter, that their trunks
and portmanteaus mu&s;t be carried to the cu&s;tom-hou&s;e,
in order to be &s;earched, and &s;ealed with
lead, which mu&s;t remain untouched until their
arrival at Paris.</P>
<P>Peregrine made no objection to this practice,
which was in it&s;elf rea&s;onable enough; but when
he under&s;tood that the gate was be&s;ieged by an|other
multitude of porters, who in&s;i&s;ted upon
their right of carrying the goods, and al&s;o of
fixing their own price, he ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed to
comply with their demand; and cha&s;ti&s;ing &s;ome
of the mo&s;t clamorous among them with his foot,
told them, that if their cu&s;tom-hou&s;e officers had
a mind to examine his baggage, they might come
to the inn for that purpo&s;e. The valet de cham|bre
was aba&s;hed at this boldne&s;s of his ma&s;ter's
behaviour, which the lacquey, &s;hrugging up his
&s;houlders, ob&s;erved was <HI>bien a l' Angloi&s;e;</HI> while
the governor repre&s;ented it as an indignity to
the whole nation, and endeavoured to per&s;uade
his pupil to comply with the cu&s;tom of the place.
But Peregrine's natural haughtine&s;s of di&s;po&s;ition
hindered him from giving ear to Jolter's whole|&s;ome
advice; and in le&s;s than half an hour they
<PB N="10" REF="19">
perceived a file of mu&s;queteers marching up to
the gate. At &s;ight of this detachment the tutor
trembled, the valet grew pale, and the lacquey
cro&s;&s;ed him&s;elf; but our hero, without exhibiting
any other &s;ymptoms than tho&s;e of indignation,
met them on the thre&s;hold, and with a ferocious
air demanded their bu&s;ine&s;s. The corporal who
commanded the file an&s;wered with great delibe|ration,
that he had orders to convey his baggage
to the cu&s;tom-hou&s;e; and &s;eeing the trunks
&s;tanding in the entry, placed his men between
them and the owner, while the porters that fol|lowed,
took them up, and proceeded to the
Douane without oppo&s;ition.</P>
<P>Pickle was not mad enough to di&s;pute the
authority of this me&s;&s;age; but, in order to gall,
and &s;pecify his contempt for tho&s;e who brought
it, he called aloud to his valet, de&s;iring him, in
French, to accompany his things, and &s;ee that
none of his linen and effects &s;hould be &s;tolen by
the &s;earchers. The corporal, mortified at this
&s;atirical in&s;inuation, darted a look of re&s;entment
at the author, as if he had been intere&s;ted for
the glory of his nation; and told him, that
he could perceive he was a &s;tranger in France,
or el&s;e he would have &s;aved him&s;elf the trouble
of &s;uch a needle&s;s precaution. Indeed this ex|pre&s;&s;ion
had no &s;ooner e&s;caped our young gentle|man,
than he was a&s;hamed of his own petu|lance;
for nothing was farther from his prin|ciples
than the lea&s;t encouragement of ungene|rous
&s;u&s;picion.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">He makes a fruitle&s;s attempt in gallantry; departs

certain Engli&s;h exiles.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING thus yielded to the hand of power,
he inquired if there was any other Engli&s;h
company in the hou&s;e; and under&s;tanding that a
gentleman and lady lodged in the next apart|ment,
and had be&s;poke a po&s;t-chai&s;e for Paris,
he ordered Pipes to ingratiate him&s;elf with their
footman, and, if po&s;&s;ible, learn their names and
condition, while he and Mr. Jolter, attended by
the lacquey, took a turn round the ramparts, and
viewed the particulars of the fortification.</P>
<P>Tom was &s;o very &s;ucce&s;sful in his inquiry, that
when his ma&s;ter returned, he was able to give
him a very &s;atisfactory account of his fellow-lodgers,
in con&s;equence of having treated his
brother with a bottle of wine. The people in
que&s;tion were a gentleman and his lady, lately
arrived from England, in their way to Paris.
The hu&s;band was a man of good fortune, who
had been a libertine in his youth, and a profe&s;&s;ed
declaimer again&s;t matrimony. He neither wanted
&s;en&s;e nor experience, and piqued him&s;elf in par|ticular
upon his art in avoiding the &s;nares of the
female &s;ex, in which he pretended to be deeply
ver&s;ed. But, notwith&s;tanding a$l his caution and
&s;kill, he had lately fallen a &s;acrifice to the attrac|tions
of an oy&s;ter-wench, who had found means
to decoy him into the bands of wedlock; and,
in order to evade the compliments and congra|tulations
of his friends and acquaintance, he had
<PB N="12" REF="21">
come &s;o far on a tour to Paris, where he intended
to initiate his &s;pou&s;e in the beau-monde; though
in the mean time he cho&s;e to live upon the re|&s;erve,
becau&s;e her natural talents had as yet re|ceived
but little cultivation; and he had not the
mo&s;t implicit confidence in her virtue and di&s;cre|tion,
which, it &s;eems, had like to have yielded
to the addre&s;&s;es of an officer at Canterbury, who
had made &s;hift to in&s;inuate him&s;elf into her ac|quaintance
and favour.</P>
<P>Peregrine's curio&s;ity being inflamed by this
information, he lounged about the yard, in hopes
of &s;eeing the Dulcinea who had captivated the
old batchelor, and at length ob&s;erving her at a
window, took the liberty of bowing to her with
great re&s;pect. She returned the compliment with
a curt'&s;ie, and appeared &s;o decent in her dre&s;s and
manner, that unle&s;s he had been previou&s;ly in|formed
of her former life and conver&s;ation, he
never would have dreamt that her education was
different from that of other ladies of fa&s;hion; &s;o
ea&s;y it is to acquire that external deportment on
which people of condition value them&s;elves &s;o
much. Not but that Mr. Pickle pretended to
di&s;tingui&s;h a certain vulgar audacity in her coun|tenance,
which in a lady of birth and fortune
would have pa&s;&s;ed for an agreeable vivacity that
enlivens the a&s;pect, and gives a poignancy to
every feature: but, as &s;he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a pair of fine
eyes and a clear complexion, over&s;pread with the
glow of health, which never fails of recom|mending
the owner, he could not help gazing at
her with de&s;ire, and forming the de&s;ign of making
a conque&s;t of her heart. With this view, he
&s;ent his compliments to her hu&s;band, who&s;e
name was Hornbeck, with an intimation, that
<PB N="13" REF="22">
he propo&s;ed to &s;et out next day for Paris, and as
he under&s;tood that he was re&s;olved upon the &s;ame
journey, he &s;hould be extremely glad of his com|pany
on the road, if he was not better engaged.
Hornbeck, who in all probability did not chu&s;e
to accommodate his wife with a &s;quire of our he|ro's
appearance, &s;ent a civil an&s;wer to his me&s;&s;age,
profe&s;&s;ing infinite mortification at his being unable
to embrace the favour of his kind offer, by rea&s;on
of the indi&s;po&s;ition of his wife, who, he was
afraid, would not be in a condition for &s;ome days
to bear the fatigue of travelling. This rebuff,
which Peregrine a&s;cribed to the hu&s;band's jea|lou&s;y,
&s;tifled his project in embrio; he ordered
his French &s;ervant to take a place for him&s;elf in
the Diligence, where all his luggage was &s;towed,
except a &s;mall trunk with &s;ome linen and other
nece&s;&s;aries that was fixed upon the po&s;t-chai&s;e
which they hired of the landlord; and early next
morning he and Mr. Jolter departed from Ca|lais,
attended by his valet de chambre and Pipes
on hor&s;eback. They proceeded without any ac|cident
as far as Boulogne, where they breakfa&s;ted
and vi&s;ited old father Graham, a Scotti&s;h gentle|man
of the governor's acquaintance, who had
lived as a capuchin in that place for the &s;pace of
three&s;core years, and during that period conformed
to all the au&s;terities of the order, with the mo&s;t
rigorous exactne&s;s; being equally remarkable for
the frankne&s;s of his conver&s;ation, the humanity
of his di&s;po&s;ition, and the &s;implicity of his manners.
From Boulogne they took their departure about
noon, and as they propo&s;ed to &s;leep that night
at Abbe Ville, commanded the po&s;tilion to drive
with extraordinary &s;peed; and perhaps it was well
for his cattle that the axle-tree gave way, and the
<PB N="14" REF="23">
chai&s;e of cour&s;e overturned before they had tra|velled
one third part of the &s;tage.</P>
<P>This accident compelled them to return to the
place from whence they had &s;et out, and as they
could not procure another convenience, they found
them&s;elves under the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;taying till their
chai&s;e could be refitted. Under&s;tanding that this
operation would detain them a whole day, our
young gentleman had recour&s;e to his patience,
and demanded to know what they could have for
dinner; the gar&ccedil;on, or waiter thus que&s;tioned,
vani&s;hed in a moment, and immediately they
were &s;urprized with the appearance of a &s;trange
figure, which from the extravagance of its dre&s;s
and ge&s;ticulation, Peregrine mi&s;took for a mad|man
of the growth of France. This phantome
(which by the bye, happened to be no other than
the cook) was a tall, long-legged, meagre, &s;war|thy
fellow, that &s;topped very much; his cheek-bones
were remarkably rai&s;ed, his no&s;e bent into
the &s;hape and &s;ize of a powder-horn, and the
&s;ockets of his eyes as raw round the edges, as if
the &s;kin had been pared off; on his head he wore
an handkerchief which had once been white, and
now &s;erved to cover the upper part of a black
periwig, to which was attached a bag, at lea&s;t a
foot &s;quare, with a &s;olitaire and ro&s;e that &s;tuck
up on each &s;ide to his ear; &s;o that he looked like a
criminal in the pillory; his back was accommo|dated
with a linnen wai&s;tcoat, his hands adorned
with long ruffies of the &s;ame piece, his middle
was girded by an apron tucked up, that it might
not conceal his white &s;ilk &s;tockings rolled; and at
his entrance he brandi&s;hed a bloody weapon full
three feet in length. Peregrine, when he fir&s;t &s;aw
him approach in this menacing attitude, put him&s;elf
<PB N="15" REF="24">
upon his guard, but being informed of his qua|lity,
peru&s;ed his li&s;t, and having be&s;poke three or
four things for dinner, walked out with Mr. Jol|ter
to view both towns, which they had not lei|&s;ure
to con&s;ider minutely before. In their return
from the harbour they met with four or five gen|tlemen,
all of whom &s;eemed to look with an air
of dejection, and perceiving our hero and his go|vernor
to be Engli&s;h by their dre&s;s, bowed with
great re&s;pect as they pa&s;&s;ed. Pickle, who was
naturally compa&s;&s;ionate, felt an emotion of &s;ym|pathy;
and &s;eeing a per&s;on, who by his habit he
judged to be one of their &s;ervants, acco&s;ted him
in Engli&s;h, and a&s;ked who the gentlemen were.
The lacquey gave him to under&s;tand that they were
his own countrymen, exiled from their native
homes, in con&s;equence of their adherence to an
unfortunate and ruined cau&s;e; and that they were
gone to the &s;ea-&s;ide, according to their daily
practice, in order to indulge their longing eyes,
with a pro&s;pect of the white cliffs of Albion, which
they mu&s;t never more approach.</P>
<P>Though our young gentleman differed widely
from them in point of political principles, he was
not one of tho&s;e enthu&s;ia&s;ts who look upon every
&s;chi&s;m from the e&s;tabli&s;hed articles of faith, as
damnable, and exclude the &s;ceptick from every
benefit of humanity and chri&s;tian forgivene&s;s: he
could ea&s;ily comprehend how a man of the mo&s;t
unblemi&s;hed morals might, by the prejudice of
education, or indi&s;pen&s;ible attachments, be ingaged
in &s;uch a blame worthy and pernicious undertak|ing;
and thought that they had already &s;uffered
$word$ for their imprudence. He was affected
with the account of their diurnal pilgrimage to
the &s;ea-&s;ide, which he con&s;idered as a pathetic
<PB N="16" REF="25">
proof of their affliction, and inve&s;ted Mr. Jolter
with the agreeable office of going to them with a
compliment in his name, and begging the honour
of drinking a gla&s;s with them in the evening.
They accepted the propo&s;al with great &s;atisfaction
and re&s;pectful acknowledgement, and in the after|noon
waited upon the kind inviter, who treated
them with coffee, and would have detained them
to &s;upper; but they intreated the favour of his
company at the hou&s;e which they frequented, &s;o
earne&s;tly, that he yielded to their &s;olicitations,
and with his governor was conducted by them to
the place, where they had provided an elegant re|pa&s;t,
and regaled them with &s;ome of the be&s;t cla|ret
in France.</P>
<P>It was ea&s;y for them to perceive that their
principal gue&s;t was no favourer of their &s;tate
maxims, and therefore they indu&s;triou&s;ly avoided
every &s;ubject of conver&s;ation which could give
the lea&s;t offence; not but that they lamented
their own &s;ituation, which cut them off from all
their deare&s;t connexions, and doomed them to
perpetual bani&s;hment from their families and
friends: but they did not even by the mo&s;t di&s;tant
hint, impeach the ju&s;tice of that &s;entence by
which they were condemned; although one
among them, who &s;eemed to be about the age of
thirty, wept bitterly over his misfortune, which
had involved a beloved wi&s;e and three children in
mi&s;ery and di&s;tre&s;s; and in the impatience of his
grief, cur&s;ed his own fate with frantic impreca|tions.
His companions, with a view of beguiling
his &s;orrow, and manife&s;ting their own ho&s;pitality
at the &s;ame time, changed the topic of di&s;cour&s;e,
and circulated the bumpers with great a&s;&s;iduity;
&s;o that all their cares were overwhelmed and for|gotten,
<PB N="17" REF="26">
&s;everal drinking French catches were
&s;ung, and mirth and good fellow&s;hip prevailed.</P>
<P>In the mid&s;t of this elevation, which commonly
unlocks the mo&s;t hidden &s;entiment, and di&s;pels
every con&s;ideration of caution and con&s;traint, one
of the entertainers being more intoxicated than
his fellows, propo&s;ed a toa&s;t, to which Peregrine
with &s;ome warmth excepted, as an unmannerly
in&s;ult. The other maintained his propo&s;ition with
indecent heat, and the di&s;pute beginning to grow
very &s;erious, the company interpo&s;ed, and gave
judgment again&s;t their friend, who was &s;o keenly
reproached and rebuked for his impolite behavi|our,
by the gentleman who&s;e &s;en&s;ibility hath been
mentioned, that he retired in high dudgeon,
threatening to relinqui&s;h their &s;ociety, and brand|ing
them with the appellation of apo&s;tates from
the common cau&s;e. Mortified at the behaviour
of their companion, tho&s;e that remained were
earne&s;t in their apologies to their gue&s;ts, whom
they be&s;ought to forgive his intemperance; a&s;&s;ur|ing
them with great confidence, that he would
upon the recovery of his reflection, wait upon
them in per&s;on, and a&s;k pardon for the umbrage
he had given. Pickle was &s;atisfied with their re|mon&s;trances,
re&s;umed his good humour, and the
night being pretty far advanced, re&s;i&s;ted all their
importunities with which he was intreated to &s;ee
another bottle go round, and was e&s;corted to his
own lodgings, more than half &s;eas over. Next
morning about eight o'clock, he was waked by
his valet de chambre, who told him that two of
the gentlemen with whom he had &s;pent the even|ing
were in the hou&s;e, and de&s;ired the favour of
being admitted into his chamber. He could not
conceive the meaning of this extraordinary vi&s;it,
<PB N="18" REF="27">
and ordering his man to &s;hew them into his apart|ment,
beheld the per&s;on who had affronted him
enter with the gentleman who had reprehended
his rudene&s;s.</P>
<P>He who had given the offence, after having
made an apology for di&s;turbing Mr. Pickle, told
him that his friend there pre&s;ent had been with
him early that morning, and propo&s;ed the alter|native
of either fighting with him immediately,
or coming to beg pardon for his unmannerly de|portment
over night; that though he had courage
enough to face any man in the field in a righteous
cau&s;e, he was not &s;o brutal as to di&s;obey the dic|tates
of his own duty and reflection, in con&s;e|quence
of which, and not out of any regard to
the other's menaces, which he de&s;pi&s;ed, he had
now taken the liberty of interrupting his repo&s;e,
that he might as &s;oon us po&s;&s;ible, atone for the
injury he had done him, which he prote&s;ted was
the effect of intoxication alone, and begged his
forgivene&s;s accordingly. Our hero accepted of
this acknowledgment very graciou&s;ly, thanked
the other gentleman for the gallant part he had
acted in his behalf; and perceiving that his com|panion
was a little irritated at his officious inter|po&s;ition,
effected a reconciliation, by convincing
him that what he had done was for the honour of
the company. He then kept them to breakfa&s;t,
expre&s;&s;ed a de&s;ire of &s;eeing their &s;ituation altered

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Proceeds for the capital. Takes up his lodging at
Bernay, where he is overtaken by Mr. Horn|beck,

<P>DURING this day's expedition, Mr. Jol|ter
took an opportunity of imparting to his
pupil the remarks he had made upon the indu&s;try
of the French, as an undeniable proof of which
he had him ca&s;t his eyes around, and ob&s;erve with
what care every &s;pot of ground was cultivated;
and from the fertility of that province, which is
reckoned the poore&s;t in France, conceive the
wealth and affluence of the nation in general.
Peregrine amazed as well as di&s;gu&s;ted at this infa|tuation,
an&s;wered that what he a&s;cribed to indu&s;try,
was the effect of meer wretchedne&s;s; the
mi&s;erable pea&s;ants being obliged to plough up
every inch of ground to &s;atisfy their oppre&s;&s;ive
landlords, while they them&s;elves and their cattle
looked like &s;o many images of famine; that their
extreme poverty was evident from the face of the
country, on which there was not one inclo&s;ure
to be &s;een, or any other object, except &s;canty
crops of barley and oats, which could never re|ward
the toil of the hu&s;bandman; that their ha|bitations
were no better than paultry huts; that
in twenty miles of extent, not one gentleman's
hou&s;e appeared; that nothing was more abject and
forlorn than the attire of their country people;
and la&s;tly, that the equipage of their travelling
chai&s;es was infinitely inferior to that of a dung|cart
in England; and that the po&s;tilion who then
<PB N="20" REF="29">
drove their carriage, had neither &s;tockings to his
legs, nor a &s;hirt to his back.</P>
<P>The governor finding his charge &s;o intractable,
re&s;olved to leave him in the mi&s;t of his own ig|norance
and prejudice, and re&s;erve his ob&s;erva|tions
for tho&s;e who would pay more deference
to his opinion; and indeed this re&s;olution he had
often made, and as often broke, in the tran&s;|ports
of his zeal, that frequently hurried him out
of the plan of conduct which in his cooler mo|ments
he had laid down. They haited for a re|fre&s;hment
at Montreuil, and about eight in the
evening arrived at a village called Bernay, where
while they waited for fre&s;h hor&s;es, they were in|formed
by the landlord, that the gates of Abbe
Ville were &s;hut every night punctually at nine
o'clock; &s;o that it would be impo&s;&s;ible for them
to get admittance; and that there was not ano|ther
place of entertainment on the road where
they could pa&s;s the night; he therefore, as a friend,
advi&s;ed them to &s;tay at his hou&s;e, where they
would find the be&s;t of accommodation, and pro|ceed
upon their journey by times in the morning.</P>
<P>Mr. Jolter, though he had travelled on that
road before, could not recollect whether or not
mine ho&s;t &s;poke truth; but his remon&s;trance be|ing
very plau&s;ible, our hero determined to follow
his advice, and being conducted into an apart|ment,
a&s;ked what they could have for &s;upper.
The landlord mentioned every thing that was eat|able
in the hou&s;e, and the whole being ingro&s;&s;ed
for the u&s;e of him and his attendants, he amu&s;ed
him&s;elf till &s;uch time as it could be dre&s;&s;ed, in con|ver&s;ing
with the daughter, who was a &s;prightly dam|&s;el
about the age of &s;eventeen; and in &s;trolling about
the hou&s;e, which &s;tands in a very rural &s;ituation.
<PB N="21" REF="30">
While he thus loitered away the time that hung
heavy on his hands, another chai&s;e arrived at the
inn, and upon inquiry he found that the new
comers were Mr. Hornbeck and his lady. The
landlord, con&s;cious of his inability to entertain this
&s;econd company, came and begged with great
humiliation that Mr. Pickle would &s;pare them
&s;ome part of the victuals he had be&s;poke; but he
refu&s;ed to part with &s;o much as the wing of a par|tridge,
though at the &s;ame time he &s;ent his com|pliments
to the &s;trangers, and giving them to un|der&s;tand
how ill the hou&s;e was provided for their
reception, invited them to partake of his &s;upper.
Mr. Hornbeck, who was not deficient in point of
politene&s;s, and extremely well di&s;po&s;ed for a re|li&s;hing
meal, which he had rea&s;on to expect from
the &s;avoury &s;team that i&s;&s;ued from the kitchen,
could not re&s;i&s;t this &s;econd in&s;tance of our young
gentleman's civility, which he acknowledged by
a me&s;&s;age, importing that he and his wife would
do them&s;elves the plea&s;ure of profiting by his
courteous offer. Peregrine's cheeks glowed when
he found him&s;elf on the eve of being acquainted
with Mrs. Hornbeck, of who&s;e heart he had al|ready
made a conque&s;t in imagination; and he
forthwith &s;et his invention at work, to contrive
&s;ome means of defeating her hu&s;band's vigilance.</P>
<P>When &s;upper was ready, he in per&s;on gave
notice to his gue&s;ts, and leading the lady into his
apartment, &s;eated her in an elbow chair at the up|per
end of the table, &s;queezing her hand and
darting a mo&s;t in&s;i$iou$ geance at the &s;ame time.
This abrupt behaviour he practi&s;ed on the pre|&s;umption,
that a lady of her breeding was not to
be addre&s;&s;ed with the tedious forms that mu&s;t be
ob&s;erved in one's advances to a per&s;on of birth
<PB N="22" REF="31">
and genteel education; and in all probability his
calculation was ju&s;t, for Mrs. Hornbeck gave no
&s;igns of di&s;content at this &s;ort of treatment, but
on the contrary, &s;eemed to con&s;ider it as a proof
of the young gentleman's regard; and though &s;he
did not venture to open her mouth three times
during the whole repa&s;t, &s;he &s;hewed her&s;elf par|ticularly
well &s;atisfied with her entertainer, by
&s;undry &s;ly and &s;ignificant looks, while her hu&s;|band's
eyes were directed another way, and di|vers
loud peals of laughter, &s;igni$ying her appro|bation
of the &s;allies which he uttered in the cour&s;e
of their conver&s;ation. Her &s;pou&s;e began to be
very unea&s;y at the frank demeanour of his yoke-fellow,
whom he endeavoured to check in her
vivacity, by a&s;&s;uming a &s;everity of a&s;pect; but
whether &s;he obeyed the dictates of her own di&s;|po&s;ition,
which, perhaps, was merry and unre|&s;erved,
or wanted to puni&s;h Mr. Hornbeck for
his jealou&s;y of temper; certain it is, her gaiety
increa&s;ed to &s;uch a degree, that her hu&s;band was
grievou&s;ly alarmed and incen&s;ed at her conduct,
and re&s;olved to make her &s;en&s;ible of his di&s;plea|&s;ure,
by treading in &s;ecret upon her toes. He was,
however, &s;o di&s;concerted by his indignation, that
he mi&s;took his mark, and applied the &s;harp heel
of his $$oe to the &s;ide of Mr. Jolter's foot, com|prehending
his little toe that was &s;tudded with an
angry corn, which he invaded with &s;uch a &s;udden
jerk, that the governor, unable to endure the tor|ture
in &s;ilence, &s;tarted up, and dancing on the floor,
roared hideou&s;ly with repeated bellowings, to the
un&s;peakable enjoyment of Peregrine and the lady,
who laughed them&s;elves almo&s;t into convul&s;ions
at the joke. Hornbeck, confounded at the mi&s;take
he had committed, begged pardon of the injured
<PB N="23" REF="32">
tutor with great contrition, prote&s;ting that the
blow he had &s;o unfortunately received, was in|tended
for an ugly cur, which he thought had
po&s;ted him&s;elf under the table. It was lucky for
him that there was actually a dog in the room, to
ju&s;tify this excu&s;e, which Jolter admitted with the
tears running over his cheeks, and the oeconomy
of the table was re-compo&s;ed.</P>
<P>As &s;oon, however, as the &s;trangers could with
decency withdraw, this &s;u&s;picious hu&s;band took
his leave of the youth, on pretence of being fa|tigued
with his journey, after having, by way of
compliment, propo&s;ed that they &s;hould travel to|gether
next day; and Peregrine handed the lady
to her chamber, where he wi&s;hed her good night
with another warm &s;queeze, which &s;he returned.
This favourable hint made his heart bound with a
tran&s;port of joy; he lay in wait for an opportu|nity
of declaring him&s;elf, and &s;eeing the hu&s;band
go down into the yard with a candle, he glided
&s;oftly into his apartment, and found her almo&s;t
undre&s;&s;ed. Impelled by the impetuo&s;ity of his
pa&s;&s;ion, which was &s;till more inflamed by her pre|&s;ent
lu&s;cious appearance, and encouraged by the
approbation &s;he had already expre&s;&s;ed, he ran to|wards
her with eagerne&s;s, crying, &startq;Zounds!
madam, your charms are irre&s;i&s;tible!&endq; and with|out
further ceremony would have cla&s;ped her in
his arms, had not &s;he begged him for the love of
God to retire, for &s;hould Mr. Hornbeck return
and find him there, &s;he would be undone for ever.
He was not &s;o blinded by his pa&s;&s;ion but that he
&s;aw the rea&s;onablene&s;s of her fear, and as he could
not pretend to crown his wi&s;hes at that interview,
he avowed him&s;elf her lover, a&s;&s;ured her that he
would exhau&s;t his whole invention in finding a
<PB N="24" REF="33">
proper opportunity for throwing him&s;elf at her
feet; and in the mean time he ravi&s;hed &s;undry
&s;mall favours, which &s;he in the hurry of her fright
could not with-hold from his impudence of ad|dre&s;s.
Having thus happily &s;ettled the prelimi|naries,
he withdrew to his own chamber, and
&s;pent the whole night in contriving &s;tratagems to
elude the jealous caution of his fellow-traveller.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">They &s;et out in company, breakfa&s;t at Abbe Ville,
dine at Amiens, and about eleven o'clock arrive
at Chantilly, where Peregrine executes a plan
which he had concerted upon Hornbeck.</HEAD>
<P>THE whole company by agreement ro&s;e and
departed before day, and breakfa&s;ted at Ab|be
Ville, where they became acquainted with the
fine&s;&s;e of their Bernay landlord, who had impo&s;ed
upon them, in affirming that they would not
have been admitted after the gates were &s;hut.
From thence they proceeded to Amiens, where
they dined and were pe&s;tered by begging friars;
and the roads being deep, it was eleven o'clock
at night before they reached Chan$illy, where
they found &s;upper already dre&s;&s;ed, in con&s;e|quence
of having di&s;patched the valet de cham|bre
before them on hor&s;eback.</P>
<P>The con&s;titution of Horneck being very much
impaired by a life of irregularity, he found him|&s;elf
&s;o fatigued with this day's journey, which
amounted to upwards of an hundred miles, that
when he &s;at down at table, he could &s;carce &s;it
upright; and in le&s;s than three minutes began to
nod in his chair. Peregrine, who had fore&s;een
<PB N="25" REF="34">
and provided for this occa&s;ion, advi&s;ed him to
exhilarate his &s;pirits with a gla&s;s of wine; and the
propo&s;al being embraced, tipt his valet de cham|bre
the wink, who, according to the in&s;tructions
he had received, qualified the Burgundy with
thirty drops of laudanum, which this unfortunate
hu&s;band &s;wallowed in one gla&s;s. The do&s;e co|operating
with his former drow&s;ine&s;s, lulled him
&s;o fa&s;t a&s;leep, as it were in&s;tantaneou&s;ly, that it
was found nece&s;&s;ary to convey him to his own
chamber, where his footman undre&s;&s;ed and put
him to bed. Nor was Jolter (naturally of a &s;lug|gi&s;h
di&s;po&s;ition) able to re&s;i&s;t his propen&s;ity to
&s;leep, without &s;uffering divers dreadful yawns,
which encouraged his pupil to admini&s;ter the &s;ame
do&s;e to him, which had operated &s;o &s;ucce&s;sfully
upon the other Argus. This cordial had not &s;uch
a gentle effect upon the rugged organs of Jolter
as upon the more delicate nerves of Hornbeck;
but di&s;covered it&s;elf in certain involuntary &s;tart|ings,
and convul&s;ive motions in the mu&s;cles of
his face; and when his nature at length yielded
to the power of this medicine, he &s;ounded the
trumpet &s;o loud through his no&s;trils, that our
adventurer was afraid the noi&s;e would awake his
other patient, and con&s;equently prevent the ac|compli&s;hment
of his aim. The governor was
therefore committed to the care of Pipes, who
lugged him into the next room, and having &s;trip|ped
off his cloaths, tumbled him into his ne&s;t,
while the two lovers remained at full liberty to
indulge their mutual pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Peregrine, in the impatience of his inclination,
would have fini&s;hed the fate of Hornbeck imme|diately;
but his inamorata di&s;approved of his in|tention,
and repre&s;ented that their being together
<PB N="26" REF="35">
by them&s;elves for any length of time, would be
ob&s;erved by her &s;ervant, who was kept as a &s;py
upon her actions; &s;o that they had recour&s;e to
another &s;cheme, which was executed in this
manner: He conducted her into her own apart|ment,
in pre&s;ence of her &s;ootman, who lighted
them thither, and wi&s;hing her good re&s;t, returned
to his own chamber, where he waited till every
thing was quiet in the hou&s;e; and then &s;tealing
&s;oftly to her door, which had been left open for
his admi&s;&s;ion in the dark, he found the hu&s;band
&s;till &s;ecure in the embraces of &s;leep, and the lady
in a loo&s;e gown, ready to &s;eal his happine&s;s. He
&s;eized opportunity by the forelock, and bearing
her in his arms to the place from whence he
came, &s;he was revenged upon the cuckold for the
unea&s;y life he had made her lead, and our hero
enjoyed the lu&s;cious fruits of his conque&s;t.</P>
<P>Their guilty raptures, however, were not with|out
allay. The opium which had been given to
Jolter, together with the wine he had drank,
produced &s;uch a perturbation in his fancy, that he
was vi&s;ited with horrible dreams, and among other
mi&s;erable &s;ituations, imagined him&s;elf in danger
of peri&s;hing in the flames, which he thought had
taken hold on his apartment. This vi&s;ion made
&s;uch an impre&s;&s;ion upon his faculties, that he
alarmed the whole hou&s;e with the repeated cries
of <HI>Fire! Fire!</HI> and even leaped out of his bed,
though he &s;till remained fa&s;t a&s;leep. The lovers
were very di&s;agreeably di&s;turbed by this dreadful
exclamation, and Mrs. Hornbeck running in great
confu&s;ion to the door, had the mortification to
&s;ee the footman with a light in his hand, enter
her hu&s;band's chamber, in order to give them
notice of this accident. She knew that &s;he would
<PB N="27" REF="36">
be in&s;tantly mi&s;&s;ed, and could ea&s;ily divine the
con&s;equence, unle&s;s her invention could immedi|ately
trump up &s;ome plau&s;ible excu&s;e for her ab|&s;ence.</P>
<P>Women are naturally fruitful of expedients in
ca&s;es of &s;uch emergency; &s;he employed but a few
&s;econds in recollection, and ru&s;hing directly to|wards
the apartment of the governor, who &s;till
continued to hollow in the &s;ame note, exclaimed
in a &s;creaming tone, &startq;Lord have mercy upon
us! where! where!&endq; By this time, all the &s;er|vants
were a&s;&s;embled in &s;trange attire; Peregrine
&s;lipt on his breeches, bur&s;t into Jolter's room, and
&s;eeing him &s;talking in his &s;hirt with his eyes &s;hut,
be&s;towed &s;uch a &s;lap upon his buttocks, as in a
moment di&s;&s;olved his dream, and re&s;tored him to
the u&s;e of his &s;en&s;es. He was a&s;toni&s;hed and
a&s;hamed at being di&s;covered in &s;uch an indecent
attitude; and taking refuge under the cloaths,
a&s;ked pardon of all pre&s;ent for the di&s;turbance he
had occa&s;ioned; &s;oliciting with great humility
the forgivene&s;s of the lady, who, to a miracle,
counterfeited the utmo&s;t agitation of terror and
&s;urprize. Mean while, Hornbeck being awakened
by the repeated efforts of his man, no &s;ooner un|der&s;tood
that his wife was mi&s;&s;ing, than all the
chimera's of jealou&s;y taking po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his ima|gination,
he &s;tarted up in a &s;ort of frenzy, and
&s;natching his &s;word, flew &s;traight to Peregrine's
chamber, where, though he found not that which
he looked for, he unluckily perceived upon the
bed an under-petticoat, which his wife had forgot
in the hurry of her retreat. This di&s;covery add|ed
fuel to the flame of his re&s;entment. He
&s;eized the fatal proof of his di&s;honour, and meet|ing
his &s;pou&s;e in her return to bed, pre&s;ented it
<PB N="28" REF="37">
to her view, &s;aying, with a mo&s;t expre&s;&s;ive coun|tenance,
&startq;Madam, you have dropped your un|der-petticoat
in the next room.&endq; Mrs. Hornbeck,
who inherited from nature a mo&s;t admirable pre|&s;ence
of mind, looked earne&s;tly at the object in
que&s;tion, and with incredible &s;erenity of counte|nance,
affirmed that the petticoat mu&s;t belong to
the hou&s;e, for &s;he had none &s;uch in her po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion.
Peregrine, who walked behind her, hearing this
a&s;&s;everation, immediately interpo&s;ed, and pulling
Hornbeck by the &s;leeve into his chamber, &startq;Gads|zooks!
&s;aid he, what bu&s;ine&s;s had you with that
petticoat? Can't you let a young fellow enjoy a
little amour with an innkeeper's daughter, with|out
expo&s;ing his infirmities to your wife? P&s;haw!
that's &s;o malicious, becau&s;e you have quitted
the&s;e adventures your&s;elf, to &s;poil the &s;port of
other people.&endq; The poor hu&s;band was &s;o con|founded
at the effrontery of his wife, and this
cavalier declaration of the young man, that his
faith began to waver; he di&s;tru&s;ted his own con|&s;cious
diffidence of temper, which that he might
not expo&s;e, he expre&s;&s;ed no doubts of Peregrine's
veracity, but a&s;king pardon for the mi&s;take he
had committed, retired with a grim look, not
yet &s;atisfied with the behaviour of his ingenious
helpmate, but on the contrary determined to in|quire
more minutely into the circum&s;tances of
this adventure; which turned out &s;o little to his
&s;atisfaction, that he ordered his &s;ervant to get
every thing ready for his departure by break of
day; and when our adventurer ro&s;e next morn|ing,
he found that his fellow-travellers were gone
above three hours, though they had agreed to
&s;tay all the forenoon, with a view of &s;eeing the
<PB N="29" REF="38">
prince of Conde's palace, and to proceed all to|gether
for Paris in the afternoon.</P>
<P>Peregrine was a little chagrined, when he un|der&s;tood
that he was &s;o &s;uddenly deprived of this
almo&s;t unta&s;ted mor&s;el; and Jolter could not
conceive the meaning of their abrupt and uncivil
di&s;appearance, which after many profound con|jectures,
he accounted for, by &s;uppo&s;ing that
Hornbeck was &s;ome &s;harper who had run away
with an heire&s;s, whom he found it nece&s;&s;ary to
conceal from the inquiry of her friends.</P>
<P>The pupil, who was well a&s;&s;ured of the true
motive, allowed his governor to enjoy the triumph
of his own penetration, and con&s;oled him&s;elf with
the hope of &s;eeing his Dulcinea again at &s;ome of
the public places in Paris, which he propo&s;ed to
frequent. Thus comforted, he vi&s;ited the mag|nificent
&s;tables and palace of Chantilly, and im|mediately
after dinner &s;et out for Paris, where
they arrived in the evening, and hired apartments
at an hotel in the Fauxbourg St. Germaine, not

The next care that ingro&s;&s;ed him was that of

abroad, except in the Engli&s;h coffee-hou&s;e,
where he &s;oon became acquainted with &s;ome of
his own countrymen, who were at Paris on the
&s;ame footing with him&s;elf. The third evening
after his journey, he was engaged in a party of
tho&s;e young &s;parks, at the hou&s;e of a noted Trai|teur,
who&s;e wife was remarkably hand&s;ome, and
otherwi&s;e extremely well qualified for alluring

from England; and he was charmed with her
per&s;onal accompli&s;hments, as well as with the
freedom and gaiety of her conver&s;ation: having

to gratify their de&s;ire, and told them, without any
ceremony or circumlocution, that &s;he would
only &s;tep into the next room to make water, and
return in an in&s;tant. This frank declaration
founded &s;o oddly in the ears of Peregrine, that he
concluded he might, without offence, take any
fort of liberty with a woman who could thus be|have
&s;o wide of decency and decorum; and on
this &s;uppo&s;ition, he followed her cavalierly to her
clo&s;et, where he addre&s;&s;ed her in &s;uch palpable
terms, as he thought her character intitled him
to u&s;e. She was &s;urpri&s;ed at his confidence, which
&s;he began to rally as a &s;pecimen of Engli&s;h plain
dealing, while &s;he very deliberately executed in
his pre&s;ence the intent of her withdrawing; and
he &s;till more encouraged by this deportment,
urged his &s;uit with &s;uch impetuo&s;ity, that the fair
<PB N="31" REF="40">
Burgeoi&s;e was compelled to cry aloud in defence
of her own virtue. Her hu&s;band ran immediately
to her a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and finding her in a very alarm|ing

$ury, that he was fain to quit his prey, and turn
again&s;t the exa&s;perated Traiteur, whom he pu|ni&s;hed
without mercy for his impudent intru&s;ion.
The lady &s;eeing her yokefellow treated with &s;o
little re&s;pect, e&s;pou&s;ed his cau&s;e, and fixing her
nails in his antagoni&s;t's face, &s;carified all one &s;ide
of his no&s;e. The noi&s;e of this encounter brought
all the &s;ervants of the hou&s;e to the re&s;cue of their
ma&s;ter, and Peregrine's company arriving at the
&s;ame time, a general battle en&s;ued, in which the
French were totally routed, the wife being in|&s;$lted,
and the hu&s;band kicked down &s;tairs.</P>
<P>The publican enraged at the indignity which
had been offered to him and his family, went out
into the &s;treet, and implored the protection of
the guet or city-guard, which having heard his
complaint, fixed their bayonets and &s;urrounded
the door, to the number of twelve or fourteen.
The young gentlemen flu&s;hed with their &s;ucce&s;s,
and con&s;idering the &s;oldiers as &s;o many London
watchmen, whom they had often put to flight,
drew their &s;words, and &s;allied out, with Peregrine
at their head. Whether the guard re&s;pected them
as foreigners, or inexperienced youths intoxicated
with liquor, they opened to right and left, and
gave them 100m to pa&s;s, without oppo&s;ition. This
complai&s;ance, which was the effect of compa&s;&s;ion,
being mi&s;interpreted by the Engli&s;h leader, he
out of meer wantonne&s;s attempted to trip up the
heels of the &s;oldier that &s;tood next him, but
failed in the execution, and received a blow on
his brea&s;t with the butt end of a fu&s;il, that made
<PB N="32" REF="41">
him &s;tagger &s;everal paces backward. Incen&s;ed at
this audacious application, the whole company
charged the detachment &s;word in hand, and after
an ob&s;tinate engagement, in which divers wounds
were given and received, every &s;oul of them was
taken, and conveyed to the main-guard, where
the commanding officer being made acquainted
with the circum&s;tances of the quarrel, in con&s;i|deration
of their youth and national ferocity, for
which the French make large allowances, &s;et them
ad at liberty, after having gently rebuked them
for the irregularity and in&s;olence of their conduct:
&s;o that all our hero acquired by his gallantry and
courage, was a number of &s;candalous marks upon
his village, that confined him a whole week to his
chamber. It was impo&s;&s;ible to conceal this di&s;a&s;ter
from Mr. Jolter, who having got intelligence of
the $word$, did not fail to remon&s;trate again&s;t
the ra&s;hne&s;s of the adventure, which, he ob|&s;erved,
mu&s;t have been fatal to them, had their
enemies been other than Frenchmen, who of all
nations under the &s;un, mo&s;t rigorou&s;ly ob&s;erve
the laws of ho&s;pitality.</P>
<P>As the governor's acquaintance lay chiefly
among Iri&s;h and Engli&s;h prie&s;ts, and a &s;et of low
people, who live by making them&s;elves nece&s;&s;ary
to &s;trangers, either in teaching the French lan|guage,
or executing &s;mall commi&s;&s;ions with which
they are intru&s;ted, he was not the mo&s;t proper
per&s;on in the world for regulating the ta&s;te of a
young gentleman who travelled for improvement,
in expectation of making a figure one day in his
own country; and being con&s;cious of his own
incapacit, he contented him&s;elf with the office
of a &s;teward, and kept a faithful account of all
the money that was di&s;bur&s;ed in the cour&s;e of
<PB N="33" REF="42">
their family expence: not but that he was ac|quainted
with all the places which are vi&s;ited by
&s;trangers on their fir&s;t arrival at Paris; and knew
to a liard what was commonly given to the Swi&s;s
of each remarkable hotel; though, with re&s;pect
to the curious painting and &s;tatuary that every
where abound in that metropolis, he was more
ignorant than the dome&s;tic that attends for a livre
a day.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, Mr. Jolter could give a very good
account of the &s;tages on the road, and &s;ave the
expence of Antonini's detail of the curio&s;ities in
Paris; he was a connoi&s;&s;eur in ordinaries, from
twelve to five and thirty livres, knew all the rates
of a Fiacre and Remi&s;e, could di&s;pute with a Tail|leur
or Traiteur upon the articles of his bill, and
&s;cold the &s;ervants in tolerable French. But the
laws, cu&s;toms and genius of the people, the cha|racters
of individuals, and &s;cenes of poli&s;hed life,
were &s;ubjects which he had neither opportunities
to ob&s;erve, inclination to con&s;ider, or di&s;cernment
to di&s;tingui&s;h. All his maxims were the &s;ugge&s;|tions
of pedantry and prejudice; &s;o that his per|ception
was ob&s;cured, his judgment bia&s;&s;ed, his
addre&s;s aukward, and his conver&s;ation ab&s;urd and
unentertaining: yet &s;uch as I have repre&s;ented this
tutor, is the greate&s;t part of tho&s;e animals who
lead raw boys about the world, under the deno|mination
of travelling governors. Peregrine,
therefore, being perfectly well acquainted with
the extent of Mr. Jolter's abilities, never dreamt
of con&s;ulting him in the di&s;po&s;ition of his conduct,
but parcelled out his time according to the dic|$$tes
of his own reflection, and the information
and direction of his companions, who had lived
<PB N="34" REF="43">
longer in France, and con&s;equently were better
acquainted with the plea&s;ures of the place.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as he was in a condition to appear a la
Fran&ccedil;oi&s;e, he hired a genteel chariot by the
month, made the tour of the Luxembourg gal|lery,
Palais Royal, all the remarkable hotels,
churches and celebrated places in Paris; vi&s;ited
St. Cloud, Marli, Ver&s;ailles, Trianon, St. Ger|main,
and Fountainbleau; enjoyed the opera,
ma&s;querades, Italian and French comedy; and
&s;eldom failed of appearing in the public walks,
in hopes of meeting with Mrs. Hornbeck, or
&s;ome adventure &s;uited to his romantic di&s;po&s;ition.
He never doubted that his per&s;on would attract
the notice of &s;ome di&s;tingui&s;hed inamorata, and
was vain enough to believe that few female hearts
were able to re&s;i&s;t the artillery of his accompli&s;h|ments,
if once he had an opportunity of planting
it to advantage. He pre&s;ented him&s;elf, how|ever,
at all the <HI>Spectacles</HI> for many weeks, with|out
reaping the fruits of his expectation; and be|gan
to entertain a very indifferent idea of the
French di&s;cernment, which had overlooked him &s;o
long, when one day in his way to the opera, his
chariot was &s;topped by an <HI>embarras</HI> in the &s;treet,
occa&s;ioned by two pea&s;ants, who having driven
their carts again&s;t each other, quarrelled, and
went to loggerheads on the &s;pot. Such a rencoun|ter
is &s;o uncommon in France, that the people
&s;hut up their &s;hops, and from their windows
threw cold water upon the combatants, with a
view of putting an end to the battle, which was
maintained with great fury and very little &s;kill,
until one of them receiving an accidental fall,
the other took the advantage of this misfortune,
and fa&s;tening upon him as he lay, began to thump
<PB N="35" REF="44">
the pavement with his head. Our hero's equipage
being detained clo&s;e by the field of this contention,
Pipes could not bear to &s;ee the laws of boxing &s;o
&s;candalou&s;ly tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed, and leaping from his
&s;tation, pulled the offender from his antagoni&s;t,
whom he rai&s;ed up, and in the Engli&s;h language,
encouraged to a &s;econd e&s;&s;ay, in&s;tructing him at
the &s;ame time, by clenching his fi&s;ts according to
art, and putting him&s;elf in a proper attitude.
Thus confirmed, the enraged carman &s;prung upon
his foe, and in all appearance would have effec|tually
revenged the injury he had &s;u&s;tained, if he
had not been prevented by the interpo&s;ition of a
lacquey belonging to a nobleman, who&s;e coach
was obliged to halt in con&s;equence of the di&s;pute.
This footman, who was di&s;tingui&s;hed by a cane,
de&s;cending from his po&s;t, without the lea&s;t cere|mony
or expo&s;tulation, began to employ his wea|pon
upon the head and &s;houlders of the pea&s;ant
who had been patronized by Pipes; upon which
Thomas re&s;enting &s;uch ungenerous behaviour,
be&s;towed &s;uch a &s;tomacher upon the officious in|termeddler,
as di&s;compo&s;ed the whole oeconomy
of his entrails, and obliged him to di&s;charge the
interjection ah! with demon&s;trations of great an|gui&s;h
and amazement. The other two footmen
who &s;tood behind the coach, &s;eeing their fellow-&s;ervant
&s;o in&s;olently a&s;&s;aulted, flew to his a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance,
and rained a mo&s;t di&s;agreeable &s;hower
upon the head of his aggre&s;&s;or, who had no
means of diver&s;ion or defence. Peregrine, though
he did not approve of Tom's conduct, could not
bear to &s;ee him &s;o roughly handled, e&s;pecially as
he thought his own honour concerned in the fray,
and therefore quitting his machine, came to the
re&s;cue of his attendant, and charged his adver&s;a|ries
<PB N="36" REF="45">
&s;word in hand. Two of them no &s;ooner
perceived this reinforcement, than they betook
them&s;elves to flight; and Pipes having twi&s;ted the
cane out of the hands of the third, belaboured
him &s;o unmercifully, that our hero thought pro|per
to interpo&s;e his authority in his behalf. The
common people &s;tood agha&s;t at this unprecedented
boldne&s;s of Pickle, who under&s;tanding that the
per&s;on who&s;e &s;ervants he had di&s;ciplined, was a
general and prince of the blood, went up to the
coach, and a&s;ked pardon for what he had done,
imputing his own behaviour to his ignorance of
the other's quality. The old nobleman accepted
of his apology with great politene&s;s, thanking
him for the trouble he had taken to reform the
manners of his dome&s;ticks; and gue&s;&s;ing from
our youth's appearance that he was &s;ome &s;tranger
of condition, very courteou&s;ly invited him into
the coach, on the &s;uppo&s;ition that they were both
bound for the opera. Pickle gladly embraced this
opportunity of becoming acquainted with a per|&s;on
of &s;uch rank, and ordering his own chariot to
follow, accompanied the count to his <HI>loge,</HI> where
he conver&s;ed with him during the whole enter|tainment.</P>
<P>He &s;oon perceived that Peregrine was not de|ficient
in &s;pirit or &s;en&s;e, and &s;eemed particularly
plea&s;ed with his engaging manner and ea&s;y de|p$$tment,
qualifications for which the Engli&s;h
nation is by no means remarkable in France, and
therefore the more con&s;picaous and agreeable in
the character of our hero, whom the nobleman
carried home that &s;ame evening, and introduced
to his lady, and &s;everal per&s;ons of fa&s;hion who
&s;$pped at his hou&s;e. Peregrine was quite capti|vated
by their a$$able behaviour and the vivacity
<PB N="37" REF="46">
of their di&s;cour&s;e; and after having been honoured
with particular marks of con&s;ideration, took his
leave, fully determined to cultivate &s;uch a valu|able
acquaintance.</P>
<P>His vanity &s;ugge&s;ted, that now the time was
come when he &s;hould profit by his talents among
the fair &s;ex, on whom he re&s;olved to employ his
utmo&s;t art and addre&s;s. With this view he a&s;&s;i|duou&s;ly
engaged in all parties to which he had ac|ce&s;s,
by means of his noble friend, who let &s;lip
no opportunity of gratifying his ambition. He
for &s;ome time &s;hared in all his amu&s;ements, and
was entertained in many of the be&s;t families of
France; but he did not long enjoy that elevation
of hope which had flattered his imagination. He
&s;oon perceived that it would be impo&s;&s;ible to
maintain the honourable connexions he had made,
without engaging every day at quadrille, or in
other words, lo&s;ing his money; for every per&s;on
of rank, whether male or female, was a pro|fef&s;ed
game&s;ter, who knew and practi&s;ed all the
&s;ine&s;&s;e of the art, of which he was intirely igno|rant.
Be&s;ides, he began to find him&s;elf a meer
novice in French gallantry, which is &s;upported by
an amazing volubility of tongue, an ob&s;equious
and incredible attention to trifles, a &s;urpri&s;ing fa|culty
of laughing out of pure complai&s;ance, and a
nothingne&s;s of conver&s;ation, which he could never
attain. In &s;hort, our hero, who among his own
countrymen would have pa&s;&s;ed for a &s;prightly en|tertaining
fellow, was con&s;idered in the brilliant
a&s;&s;emblies of France as a youth of a very phleg|$$tic
di&s;po&s;ition. No wonder then that his pride
was mortified at his own want of importance,
which he did not &s;ail to a&s;cribe to their defect in
point of judgment and ta&s;te; he conceived a
<PB N="38" REF="47">
di&s;gu&s;t at the mercenary conduct, as well as the
&s;hallow intellects of the ladies; and after he had
&s;pent &s;ome months, and a round &s;um of money,
in fruitle&s;s attendance and addre&s;&s;es, he fairly
quitted the pur&s;uit, and con&s;oled him&s;elf with
the conver&s;ation of a merry <HI>Fille de joye,</HI> who&s;e
good graces he acquired by an allowance of twenty
Louis per month; and that he might the more
ea&s;ily afford this expence, di&s;mi&s;&s;ed his chariot and
French lacquey at the &s;ame time.</P>
<P>He then entered him&s;elf in a noted academy,
in order to fini&s;h his exerci&s;es, and contracted an
acquaintance with a few &s;en&s;ible people, whom
he di&s;tingui&s;hed at the coffee-hou&s;e and ordinary
to which he re&s;orted, and who contributed not a
little to the improvement of his knowledge and
ta&s;te; for, prejudice apart, it mu&s;t be owned
that France abounds with men of con&s;ummate
honour, profound &s;agacity, and the mo&s;t liberal
education. From the conver&s;ation of &s;uch, he
obtained a di&s;tinct idea of their government and
con&s;titution; and though he could not help ad|miring
the excellent order and oeconomy of their
police, the re&s;ult of all his inquiries was &s;elf-con|gratulation
on his title to the privileges of a Bri|ti&s;h
&s;ubject. Indeed this invaluable birthright
was rendered con&s;picuous by &s;uch flagrant occur|rences,
which fell every day almo&s;t under his ob|&s;ervation,
that nothing but the gro&s;&s;e&s;t prejudice
could di&s;pute its exi&s;tence.</P>

<P>AMONG many other in&s;tances of the &s;ame

<P>A lady of di&s;tingui&s;hed character having been
lampooned by &s;ome ob&s;cure &s;cribler, who could
not be di&s;covered, the mini&s;try, in con&s;equence

twenty abb&eacute;s to be apprehended and &s;ent to the
Ba&s;tile, on the maxim of Herod, when he com|manded
the innocents to be murdered, hoping
that the principal object of his cruelty would
not e&s;cape in the general calamity; and the
friends of tho&s;e unhappy pri&s;oners dur&s;t not even
complain of the unju&s;t per&s;ecution, but &s;hrugged
up their &s;houlders, and in &s;ilence deplored their
misfortune, uncertain whether or not they &s;hould
ever &s;et eyes on them again.</P>
<P>About the &s;ame time, a gentleman of family,
who had been oppre&s;&s;ed by a certain powerful
duke that lived in the neighbourhood, found
<PB N="40" REF="49">
means to be introduced to the king, who re|ceiving
his petition very graciou&s;ly, a&s;ked in
what regiment he &s;erved; and when the memo|riali&s;t
an&s;wered, that he had not the honour of
being in the &s;ervice, returned the paper unopen|ed,
and refu&s;ed to hear one circum&s;tance of his
complaint; &s;o that, far from being redre&s;&s;ed, he
remained more than ever expo&s;ed to the tyranny
of his oppre&s;&s;ors: nay, &s;o notorious is the di&s;|couragement
of all tho&s;e who pre&s;ume to live
independent of court-favour and connexions,
that one of the gentlemen, who&s;e friend&s;hip Pe|regrine
cultivated, frankly owned he was in po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion
of a mo&s;t romantic place in one of the
provinces, and deeply enamoured of a country
life; and yet he dur&s;t not re&s;ide upon his own
e&s;tate, le&s;t by &s;lackening in his attendance up|on
the great, who honoured him with their pro|tection,
he &s;hould fall a prey to &s;ome rapacious
intendant.</P>
<P>As for the common people, they are &s;o much
inured to the &s;courge and in&s;olence of power,
that every &s;habby &s;ubaltern, every beggarly cadet
of the noble&s;&s;e, every low retainer to the court,
in&s;ults and injures them with impunity. A cer|tain
Ecuyer, or hor&s;e-dealer, belonging to the
king, being one day under the hands of a barber,
who by accident cut the head of a pimple on his
face, he &s;tarted up, and drawing his &s;word,
wounded him de&s;perately in the &s;houlder. The
poor trade&s;man, hurt as he was, made an effort
to retire, and was followed by this barbarous a&s;|&s;a&s;&s;in,
who not contented with the vengeance he
had taken, plunged his &s;word a &s;econd time into
his body, and killed him on the &s;pot. Having
<PB N="41" REF="50">
performed this inhuman exploit, he dre&s;&s;ed him|&s;elf
with great deliberation, and going to Ver|&s;ailles,
immediately obtained a pardon for what
he had done; triumphing in his brutality with
&s;uch in&s;olence, that the very next time he had
occa&s;ion to be &s;haved, he &s;at with his &s;word ready
drawn, in order to repeat the murder, in ca&s;e
the barber &s;hould commit the &s;ame mi&s;take. Yet
&s;o tamed are tho&s;e poor people to &s;ubjection, that
when Peregrine mentioned this a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination to
his own trimmer, with expre&s;&s;ions of horror and
dete&s;tation, the in&s;atuated wretch replied, that
without all doubt it was a misfortune, but it pro|ceeded
from the gentleman's pa&s;&s;ion; and ob|&s;erved,
by way of encomium on the govern|ment,
that &s;uch vivacity is never puni&s;hed in
France.</P>
<P>A few days after this outrage was committed,
our youth, who was a profe&s;&s;ed enemy to a$l
oppre&s;&s;ion, being in one of the fir&s;t loges at the
comedy, was eye-witne&s;s of an adventure which
filled him with indignation: a tall, ferocious fel|low
in the parterre, without the lea&s;t provoca|tion,
but prompted by the meer wantonne&s;s of
pride, took hold of the hat of a very decent young
man who happened to &s;tand before him, and
twirled it round upon his head. The party thus
offended turned to his aggre&s;&s;or, and divilly a&s;ked
the rea&s;on of &s;uch treatment; but he received no
an&s;wer; and when he looked the other way, the
in&s;ult was repeated: upon which he expre&s;&s;ed his
re&s;entment as became a man of &s;pirit, and de&s;ired
the offender to walk out with him. No &s;ooner
did he thus &s;ignify his intention, than his adver|&s;ary,
&s;welling with rage, cocked his hat fiercely
in his face, and fixing his hands in his &s;ides, pro|nounced
<PB N="42" REF="51">
with the mo&s;t imperious tone, &startq;Heark
ye, Mr. Round Periwig, you mu&s;t know that I
am a mou&s;quetaire.&endq; Scarce had this awful word
e&s;caped from his lips, when the blood for&s;ook the
lips of the poor challenger, who with the mo&s;t
abject &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion begged pardon for his pre|&s;umption,
and with difficulty obtained it, on con|dition
that he &s;hould immediately quit the place.
Having thus exerci&s;ed his authority, he turned
to one of his companions, and with an air of
di&s;dainful ridicule, told him he was like to have
had an affair with a Bourgeois; adding, by way
of heightening the irony, &startq;Egad! I believe he's
a phy&s;ician.&endq;</P>
<P>Our hero was &s;o much &s;hocked and irritated
at this licentious behaviour, that he could not
&s;uppre&s;s his re&s;entment, which he manife&s;ted, by
&s;aying to this Hector, &startq;Sir, a phy&s;ician may be
a man of honour.&endq; To this remon&s;trance,
which was delivered with a very &s;ignificant coun|tenance,
the mou&s;quetaire made no other reply,
but that of ecchoing his a&s;&s;ertion with a loud
laugh, in which he was joined by his confederates;
and Peregrine glowing with re&s;entment, called
him a <HI>Fanfaron,</HI> and withdrew, in expectation
of being followed into the &s;treet. The other
under&s;tood the hint, and a rencounter mu&s;t have
en&s;ued, had not the officer of the guard, who
overheard what pa&s;&s;ed, prevented their meeting,
by putting the mou&s;quetaire immediately under
arre&s;t. Our young gentleman waited at the door
of the parterre, until he was informed of this
interpo&s;ition, and then went home very much
chagrined at his di&s;appintment; for he was an
utter &s;tranger to fear and diffidence on the&s;e oc|ca&s;ions,
and had &s;et his heart upon cha&s;ti&s;ing the
<PB N="43" REF="52">
in&s;olence of this bully, who had treated him with
&s;uch di&s;re&s;pect.</P>
<P>This adventure was not &s;o private but that
it reached the ears of Mr. Jolter, by the canal
of &s;ome Engli&s;h gentlemen who were pre&s;ent
when it happened; and the governor, who en|tertained
a mo&s;t dreadful idea of the mou&s;quetaires,
being alarmed at a quarrel, the con&s;equence of
which might be fatal to his charge, waited on
the Briti&s;h emba&s;&s;ador, and begged he would
take Peregrine under his immediate protection.
His excellency having heard the circum&s;tances
of the di&s;pute, &s;ent one of his gentlemen to in|vite
the youth to dinner; and after having a&s;&s;ured
him that he might depend upon his countenance
and regard, repre&s;ented the ra&s;hne&s;s and impe|tuo&s;ity
of his conduct &s;o much to his conviction,
that he promi&s;ed to act more circum&s;pectly for
the future, and drop all thoughts of the mou&s;que|taire
from that moment.</P>
<P>A few days after he had taken this laudable re|&s;olution,
Pipes, who had carried a billet to his
mi&s;tre&s;s, informed him, that he had perceived a
laced hat lying upon a marble &s;lab in her apart|ment;
and that when &s;he came out of her own
chamber to receive the letter, &s;he appeared in
manife&s;t di&s;order.</P>
<P>From the&s;e hints of intelligence, our young
gentleman &s;u&s;pected, or rather made no doubt of
her in&s;idelity; and being by this time well nigh
cloyed with po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, was not &s;orry to find that
&s;he had given him cau&s;e to renounce her cor|re&s;pondence.
That he might therefore detect
her in the very breach of duty, and at the &s;ame
time puni&s;h the gallant who had the pre&s;umption
to invade his territories, he concerted with him|&s;elf
<PB N="44" REF="53">
a plan, which was executed in this manner:
During his next interview with his Dulcinea,
far from di&s;covering the lea&s;t &s;ign of jealou&s;y or
di&s;content, he affected the appearance of ex|traordinary
fondne&s;s; and after having &s;pent the
afternoon with the &s;hew of uncommon &s;atisfac|tion,
told her he was engaged in a party for
Fountainbleau, and would &s;et out from Paris that
&s;ame evening; &s;o that he &s;hould not have the
plea&s;ure of &s;eeing her again for &s;ome days.</P>
<P>The lady, who was very well ver&s;ed in the
arts of her occupation, pretended to receive this
piece of news with great affliction, and conjured
him with &s;uch marks of real tenderne&s;s, to return
as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible to her longing arms, that he went
away almo&s;t convinced of her &s;incerity. Deter|mined,
however, to pro&s;ecute his &s;cheme, he
actually departed from Paris with two or three
gentlemen of his acquaintance, who had hired a
Remi&s;e for a jaunt to Ver&s;ailles; and having ac|companied
them as far as the village of Pa&s;s&eacute;, re|turned
in the du&s;k of the evening on foot.</P>
<P>He waited impatiently till midnight, and then
arming him&s;elf with a pair of pocket-pi&s;tols, and
attended by tru&s;ty Tom with a cudgel in his
hand, repaired to the lodgings of his &s;u&s;pected
inamorata; and having given Pipes his cue,
knocked gently at the door, which was no &s;ooner
opened by the lacquey than he bolted in, before
the fellow could recollect him&s;elf from the con|fu&s;ion
occa&s;ioned by his unexpected appearance;
and leaving Tom to guard the door, ordered the
trembling valet to light him up &s;tairs into his la|dy's
apartment. The fir&s;t object that pre&s;ented
it&s;elf to his view, when he entered the anti|chamber,
was a &s;word upon the table, which he
<PB N="45" REF="54">
immediately &s;eized, exclaiming in a loud and me|nacing
voice, that his mi&s;tre&s;s was fal&s;e, and then
in bed with another gallant, whom he would
in&s;tantly put to death. This declaration, con|firmed
by many terrible oaths, he calculated for
the hearing of his rival, who under&s;tanding his
&s;anguinary purpo&s;e, &s;tarted up in great trepida|tion,
and naked as he was, dropt from the
balcony into the &s;treet, while Peregrine thun|dered
at the door for admittance; and gue&s;&s;ing
his de&s;ign, gave him an opportunity of making
this precipitate retreat. Pipes, who &s;tood centi|nel
at the door, ob&s;erving the fugitive de&s;cend,
attacked him with his cudgel, and &s;weating him
from one end of the &s;treet to the other, at la&s;t
committed him to the guet, by whom he was
conveyed to the officer on duty in a mo&s;t di&s;|graceful
and deplorable condition.</P>
<P>Mean while, Peregrine having bur&s;t open the
chamber door, found the lady in the utmo&s;t
dread and con&s;ternation, and the &s;poils of her
favourite &s;cattered about the room: but his re|&s;entment
was doubly gratified, when he learnt
upon inquiry, that the per&s;on who had been &s;o di&s;|agreeably
interrupted, was no other than that indi|vidual
mou&s;quetaire with whom he had quarreled
at the comedy. He upbraided the nymph with
her perfidy and ingratitude, and telling her that
&s;he mu&s;t not expect the continuance of his re|gard,
or the appointments which &s;he had hitherto
enjoyed from his bounty, went home to his own
lodgings, overjoyed at the i&s;&s;ue of the adventure.</P>
<P>The &s;oldier, exa&s;perated at the di&s;grace he
had undergone, as well as at the outragious in|&s;ult
of the Engli&s;h valet, whom he believed his
ma&s;ter had tutored for that purpo&s;e, no &s;ooner
<PB N="46" REF="55">
extricated him&s;elf from the opprobrious &s;ituation
he had incurred, than breathing vengeance again&s;t
the author of the affront, he came to Peregrine's
apartment, and demanded &s;atisfaction upon the
ramparts next morning before &s;un-ri&s;e. Our
hero a&s;&s;ured him, he would not fail to pay his re&s;|pects
to him at the time and place appointed;
and fore&s;eeing that he might be prevented from
keeping this engagement by the officious care of
his governor, who &s;aw the mou&s;quetaire come in,
he told Mr. Jolter, that the Frenchman had vi|&s;ited
him in con&s;equence of an order he had re|ceived
from his &s;uperiors, to make an apology for
his rude behaviour to him in the playhou&s;e, and
that they had parted very good friends. This
a&s;&s;urance, together with Pickle's tranquil and
unconcerned behaviour thro' the day, quieted the
terrors which had begun to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his
tutor's imagination; &s;o that the youth had an
opportunity of giving him the &s;lip at night, when
he betook him&s;elf to the lodgings of a friend,
whom he engaged as his &s;econd, and with whom
he immediately took the field, in order to avoid
the &s;earch which Jolter, upon mi&s;&s;ing him, might
&s;et on foot.</P>
<P>This was a nece&s;&s;ary precaution; for as he
did not appear at &s;upper, and Pipes, who u&s;ually
attended him in his excur&s;ions, could give no ac|count
of his motions, the governor was dread|fully
alarmed at his ab&s;ence, and ordered his man
to run in que&s;t of his ma&s;ter to all the places
which he u&s;ed to frequent, while he him&s;elf went
to the commi&s;&s;aire, and communicating his &s;u&s;|picions,
was accommodated with a party of the
hor&s;e-guards, who patroled round all the <HI>environs</HI>
of the city, with a view of preventing the ren|counter,
<PB N="47" REF="56">
Pipes might have directed them to the
lady, by who&s;e information they could have learnt
the name and lodgings of the mou&s;quetaire, who
being apprehended, the duel would not have hap|pened;
but he did not choo&s;e to run the risk of
di&s;obliging his ma&s;ter, by intermeddling in the
affair, and was, moreover, very de&s;irous that the
Frenchman &s;hould be humbled; for he never
doubted that Peregrine was more than a match
for any two men in France. In this confidence,
therefore, he &s;ought his ma&s;ter with great dili|gence,
not with a view of di&s;appointing his inten|tion,
but in order to attend him to the battle, that
he might &s;tand by him, and &s;ee ju&s;tice done.</P>
<P>While this inquiry was carried on, our hero
and his companion concealed them&s;elves among
&s;ome weeds that grew on the edge of the parapet,
a few yards from the &s;pot where he had agreed to
meet the mou&s;quetaire; and &s;carce had the morn|ing
rendered objects di&s;tingui&s;hable, when they
perceived their men advancing boldly to the place.
Peregrine &s;eeing them approach, &s;prung forward
to the ground, that he might have the glory of
anticipating his antagoni&s;t; and &s;words being
drawn, all four were engaged in a twinkling.
Pickle's eagerne&s;s had well nigh co&s;t him his life;
for, without minding his footing, he flew di|rectly
to his oppo&s;ite, and &s;tumbling over a &s;tone,
was wounded on one &s;ide of his head before he
could recover his attitude. Far from being di&s;|&s;pirited
at this check, it &s;erved only to animate
him the more; being endowed with uncommon
agility, he retrieved his po&s;ture in a moment,
and having parried a &s;econd thru&s;t, returned the
longe with &s;uch incredible &s;peed, that the &s;oldier
had not time to re&s;ume his guard, but was im|mediately
<PB N="48" REF="57">
run through the bend of his right arm;
and the &s;word dropping out of his hand, our he|ro's
victory was compleat.</P>
<P>Having di&s;patched his own bu&s;ine&s;s, and re|ceived
the acknowledgment of his adver&s;ary, who
with a look of infinite mortification ob&s;erved,
that his was the fortune of the day, he ran to
part the &s;econds, ju&s;t as the weapon was twi&s;ted
out of his companion's hand: upon which he
took his place; and, in all likelihood, an ob&s;ti|nate
di&s;pute would have en&s;ued, had they not
been interrupted by the guard, at &s;ight of whom
the two Frenchmen &s;campered off, while our
young gentleman and his friend allowed them|&s;elves
to be taken pri&s;oners by the detachment
which had been &s;ent out for that purpo&s;e, and
were carried before the magi&s;trate, who having
&s;harply reprimanded them for pre&s;uming to act
in contempt of the laws, &s;et them at liberty, in
con&s;ideration of their being &s;trangers, cautioning
them at the &s;ame time to beware of &s;uch exploits
for the future.</P>
<P>When Peregrine returned to his own lodgings,
Pipes &s;eeing the blood trickling down upon his
ma&s;ter's neckcloth and &s;olitaire, gave evident to|kens
of &s;urprize and concern, not for the con|&s;equences
of the wound, which he did not &s;up|po&s;e
dangerous, but for the glory of Old England,
which he was afraid had &s;uffered in the engage|ment;
for, he could not help &s;aying, with an air
of chagrin, as he followed the youth into his
chamber, &startq;I do &s;uppo&s;e as how you gave that
lubberly Frenchman as good as he brought.&endq;</P>

<PB N="49" REF="58">
<HEAD>CHAP. XLV.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Mr. Jolter threatens to leave him on account of his
mi&s;conduct, which he promi&s;es to rectify; but
his re&s;olution is defeated by the impetuo&s;ity of his
pa&s;&s;ions. He meets accidentally with Mrs. Horn|beck,
who elopes with him from her hu&s;band,
but is re&s;tored by the interpo&s;ition of the Briti&s;h
emba&s;&s;ador.</HEAD>
<P>THOUGH Mr. Jolter was extremely well
plea&s;ed at the &s;afety of his pupil, he could
not forgive him for the terror and anxiety he had
undergone on his account; and roundly told him,
that notwith&s;tanding the inclination and attach|ment
he had to his per&s;on, he would imme|diately
depart for England, if ever he &s;hould hear
of his being involved in &s;uch another adventure;
for it could not be expected that he would &s;acri|fice
his own quiet, to an unrequited regard for
one who &s;eemed determined to keep him in con|tinual
unea&s;ine&s;s and apprehen&s;ion.</P>
<P>To this declaration Pickle made an&s;wer, that
Mr. Jolter, by this time, ought to be convinced
of the attention he had always paid to his ea&s;e
and &s;atisfaction; &s;ince he well knew, that he
had ever looked upon him in the light of a friend
rather than as a coun&s;ellor or tutor, and de&s;ired
his company in France with a view of promoting
his intere&s;t, and not for any emolument he could
expect from his in&s;truction. This being the ca&s;e,
he was at liberty to con&s;ult his own inclinations
with regard to going or &s;taying; though he could
not help owning him&s;elf obliged by the concern
he expre&s;&s;ed for his &s;afety, and would endeavour,
<PB N="50" REF="59">
for his own &s;ake, to avoid giving him any cau&s;e
of di&s;turbance in time to come.</P>
<P>No man was more capable of moralizing upon
Peregrine's mi&s;conduct than him&s;elf; his reflec|tions
were extremely ju&s;t and &s;agacious, and at|tended
with no other di&s;advantage, but that of
occurring too late. He projected a thou&s;and &s;a|lutary
&s;chemes of deportment, but, like other
projectors, he never had intere&s;t enough with
the mini&s;try of his pa&s;&s;ions to bring any one of
them to bear. He had, in the heyday of his gal|lantry,
received a letter from his friend Gaunt|let,
with a kind po&s;t&s;cript from his charming
Emilia; but it arrived at a very un&s;ea&s;onable
juncture, when his imagination was engro&s;&s;ed by
conque&s;ts that more agreeably flattered his ambi|tion;
&s;o that he could not find lei&s;ure and incli|nation,
from that day, to honour the corre&s;pon|dence
which he him&s;elf had &s;ollicited; and his
vanity had, by this time, di&s;approved of the en|gagement
he had contracted in the rawne&s;s and
inexperience of youth; &s;ugge&s;ting, that he was
born to make &s;uch an important figure in life, as
ought to rai&s;e his ideas above the con&s;ideration of
any &s;uch middling connections, and fix his atten|tion
upon objects of the mo&s;t &s;ublime attraction.
The&s;e dictates of ridiculous pride had almo&s;t ef|faced
the remembrance of his amiable mi&s;tre&s;s,
or at lea&s;t &s;o far warped his morals and integrity,
that he actually began to conceive hopes of her
altogether unworthy of his own character and her
de&s;erts.</P>
<P>Mean while, being de&s;titute of a toy for the
dalliance of his idle hours, he employed &s;everal
&s;pies, and almo&s;t every day made a tour of the
public places in per&s;on, with a view of pro|curing
<PB N="51" REF="60">
intelligence of Mr. Hornbeck, with who&s;e
wife he longed to have another interview; and
in this cour&s;e of expectation had he exerci&s;ed
him&s;elf a whole fortnight, when chancing to be
at the ho&s;pital of the invalids with a gentleman
lately arrived from England, he no &s;ooner en|tered
the church than he perceived this lady, at|tended
by her &s;pou&s;e, who at &s;ight of our hero
changed colour, and looked another way, in or|der
to di&s;courage any communication between
them. But the young man, who was not &s;o ea|&s;ily
repul&s;ed, advanced with great a&s;&s;urance to
his fellow-traveller, and taking him by the hand,
expre&s;&s;ed his &s;atisfaction at this unexpected meet|ing;
and kindly upbraiding him for his precipi|tate
retreat from Chantilly, before Hornbeck
could make any reply, he went up to his wife,
whom he complimented in the &s;ame manner, a&s;|&s;uring
her with &s;ome &s;ignificant glances, he was
extremely mortified, that &s;he had put it out of
his power to pay his re&s;pects to her, on his fir&s;t
arrival at Paris; and then turning to her hu&s;band,
who thought proper to keep clo&s;e to him in this
conference, begged to know where he could have
the honour of waiting upon him; ob&s;erving at
the &s;ame time, that he him&s;elf lived <HI>a l'academie
de Palfrenier.</HI></P>
<P>Mr. Hornbeck, without making an apology
for his elopement on the road, thanked Mr.
Pickle for his complai&s;ance in a very cool and
di&s;obliging manner; &s;aying, that as he intended
to &s;hift his lodgings in a day or two, he could not
expect the plea&s;ure of &s;eeing him, until he &s;hould
be &s;ettled, when he would call at the academy,
and conduct him to his new habitation.</P>
<P><PB N="52" REF="61">
Pickle, who was not unacquainted with the
&s;entiments of this jealous gentleman, did not put
much confidence in his promi&s;e, and therefore
made divers efforts to enjoy a little private con|ver&s;ation
with his wife; but he was baffled in all
his attempts by the indefatigable vigilance of her
keeper, and reaped no other immediate plea&s;ure
from this accidental meeting, than that of a kind
&s;queeze while he handed her into the coach.
However, as he had been witne&s;s to &s;ome in|&s;tances
of her invention, and was no &s;tranger to
the favourable di&s;po&s;ition of her heart, he enter|tained
&s;ome faint hopes of profiting by her un|der&s;tanding,
and was not deceived in his expec|tation;
for the very next forenoon a Savoyard
called at the academy, and put the following
billet in his hand:</P>

<P><PB N="53" REF="62">
Our young gentleman was ravi&s;hed at the re|ceit
of this elegant epi&s;tle, which was directed,
<HI>A Mon&s;r Mon&s;r Pickhell, a la Gaddamme de Paul
Freny,</HI> and did not fail to obey the &s;ummons at
the hour of a&s;&s;ignation; when the lady, true to
her appointment, beckoned him up &s;tairs, and
he had the good fortune to be admitted un&s;een.</P>
<P>After the fir&s;t tran&s;ports of their mutual joy at
meeting, &s;he told him, that her hu&s;band had
been very &s;urly and cro&s;s ever &s;ince the adventure
at Chantilly, which he had not yet dige&s;ted;
that he had laid &s;evere injunctions upon her to
avoid all commerce with Pickle, and even threat|ened
to &s;hut her up in a convent for life, if ever
&s;he &s;hould di&s;cover the lea&s;t inclination to renew
that acquaintance; that &s;he had been cooped up
in her chamber &s;ince her arrival at Paris, with|out
being permitted to &s;ee the place, or indeed
any company, except that of her landlady, who&s;e
language &s;he did not under&s;tand; &s;o that her &s;pi|rit
being broke, and her health impaired, he was
prevailed upon &s;ome days ago to indulge her in a
few airings, during which &s;he had &s;een the gar|dens
of the Luxembourg, the Thuilleries and
Palais Royal, though at tho&s;e times when there
was no company in the walks; and that it was
in one of tho&s;e excur&s;ions &s;he had the happine&s;s
of meeting with him. Finally, &s;he gave him to
under&s;tand, that rather than continue longer in
&s;uch confinement with the man whom &s;he could
not love, &s;he would in&s;tantly give him the &s;lip,
and put her&s;elf under the protection of her lover.</P>
<P>Ra&s;h and unthinking as this declaration might
be, the young gentleman was &s;o much of a gal|lant,
that he would not baulk the lady's inclina|tions,
and too infatuated by his pa&s;&s;ion to fore&s;ee
<PB N="54" REF="63">
the con&s;equences of &s;uch a dangerous &s;tep; he
therefore, without he&s;itation, embraced the pro|po&s;al,
and the coa&s;t being clear, they &s;allied into
the &s;treet, where Peregrine calling a Fiacre, or|dered
the coachman to drive them to a tavern:
but knowing it would not be in his power to
conceal her from the &s;earch of the lieutenant de
police, if &s;he &s;hould remain within the walls of
Paris, he hired a Remi&s;e, and carried her that &s;ame
evening to Villejuif, about four leagues from
town, where he &s;tayed with her all night; and
having boarded her on a genteel pen&s;ion, and
&s;ettled the oeconomy of his future vi&s;its, returned
next day to his own lodgings.</P>
<P>While he thus enjoyed his &s;ucce&s;s, her hu&s;band
endured the tortures of the damned. When he
returned from the coffee-hou&s;e, and under&s;tood
that his wife had eloped, without being perceived
by any per&s;on in the family, he began to rave
and foam at the mouth with rage and jealou&s;y,
and in the &s;ury of di&s;traction, accu&s;ed the land-lady
of being an accomplice in her e&s;cape, threat|ening
to complain of her to the commi&s;&s;aire.
The woman could not conceive how Mrs. Horn|beck,
who &s;he knew was an utter &s;tranger to the
French language, and kept no &s;ort of company,
could elude the caution of her hu&s;band, and find
any refuge in a place where &s;he had no ac|quaintance,
and began to &s;u&s;pect the lodger's
emotion was no other than an affected pa&s;&s;ion to
conceal his own practices upon his wife, who had
perhaps fallen a &s;acrifice to his jealous di&s;po&s;ition.
She therefore &s;pared him the trouble of putting
his menaces in execution, by going to the magi|&s;trate
without any further deliberation, and gi|ving
an account of what &s;he knew concerning
this my&s;terious affair, with certain in&s;inuations
<PB N="55" REF="64">
again&s;t Hornbeck's character, which &s;he repre|&s;ented
as peevi&s;h and capricious to the la&s;t degree.</P>
<P>While &s;he thus anticipated the purpo&s;e of the
plaintiff, her information was interrupted by the
arrival of the party him&s;elf, who exhibited his
complaint with &s;uch evident marks of perturba|tion,
anger and impatience, that the commi&s;&s;aire
could ea&s;ily perceive that he had no &s;hare in the
di&s;appearance of his wife; and directed him to
the lieutenant de police, who&s;e province it is to
take cognizance of &s;uch occurrences. This gen|tleman,
who pre&s;ides over the city of Paris,
having heard the particulars of Hornbeck's mi&s;|fortune,
a&s;ked if he &s;u&s;pected any individual per|&s;on
as the &s;educer of his yoke-follow; and when
he mentioned Peregrine as the object of his &s;u&s;|picion,
granted a warrant and a detachment of
&s;oldiers, to &s;earch for and retrieve the fugitive.</P>
<P>The hu&s;band conducted them immediately to
the academy where our hero lodged, and having
rummaged the whole place, to the a&s;toni&s;hment
of Mr. Jolter, without finding either his wife or
the &s;uppo&s;ed ravi&s;her, accompanied them to all
the public hou&s;es in the Fauxbourg; which hav|ing
examined al&s;o without &s;ucce&s;s, he returned
to the magi&s;trate in a &s;tate of de&s;pair, and ob|taired
a promi&s;e of his making &s;uch an effectual
inquiry, that in three days he &s;hould have an ac|count
of her, provided &s;he was alive, and within
the walls of Paris.</P>
<P>Our adventurer, who had fore&s;een all this di|&s;turbance,
was not at all &s;urprized when his go|vernor
told him what had happened; and being
conjured to re&s;tore the woman to the right owner,
with many pathetic remon&s;trances touching the hei|nous
&s;in of adultery, the di&s;traction of the unfortu|nate
<PB N="56" REF="65">
hu&s;band, and the danger of incurring the re|&s;entment
of an arbitrary government, which, upon
application being made, would not fail of e&s;pou&s;ing
the cau&s;e of the injured; he denied, with great
effrontery, that he had the lea&s;t concern in the
matter, pretended to re&s;ent the deportment of
Hornbeck, whom he threatened to cha&s;ti&s;e for
his &s;candalous &s;u&s;picion, and expre&s;&s;ed his di&s;plea|&s;ure
at the credulity of Jolter, who &s;eemed to
doubt the veracity of his a&s;&s;everation.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding this confident behaviour, Jolter
could not help entertaining doubts of his &s;ince|rity;
and vi&s;iting the di&s;con&s;olate &s;wain, begged
he would, for the honour of his country, as well
as for the &s;ake of his own reputation, di&s;con|tinue
his addre&s;&s;es to the lieutenant de police, and
apply to the Briti&s;h Emba&s;&s;ador, who by dint of
friendly admonitions, would certainly prevail upon
Mr. Pickle to do him all the ju&s;tice in his power,
if he was really the author of the injury he had
&s;u&s;tained. The governor urged this advice with
the appearance of &s;o much &s;ympathy and concern,
promi&s;ing to co-operate with all his influence in
his behalf, that Hornbeck embraced the propo&s;al,
communicated his purpo&s;e to the magi&s;trate, who
commended the re&s;olution as the mo&s;t decent and
de&s;irable expedient he could u&s;e, and then waited
upon his excellency, who readily e&s;pou&s;ed his
cau&s;e, and &s;ending for the young gentleman that
&s;ame evening, read him &s;uch a lecture in private,
as extorted a confe&s;&s;ion of the whole affair; not
that he a&s;&s;ailed him with four and &s;upercilious
maxims, or &s;evere rebuke, becau&s;e he had pene|tration
enough to di&s;cern, that Peregrine's di&s;|po&s;ition
was impregnable to all &s;uch attacks; but
he fir&s;t of all rallied him upon his intriguing ge|nius,
<PB N="57" REF="66">
then, in an humorous manner, de&s;cribed
the di&s;traction of the poor cuckold, who he owned
was ju&s;tly puni&s;hed for the ab&s;urdity of his con|duct;
and la&s;tly, upon the &s;uppo&s;ition, that it
would be no great effort in Pickle to part with
&s;uch a conque&s;t, e&s;pecially after it was for &s;ome
time po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, repre&s;ented the nece&s;&s;ity and ex|pediency
of re&s;toring her, not only out of regard
to his own character, and that of his nation,
but al&s;o with a view to his ea&s;e, which would in
a little time be very much invaded by &s;uch an
incumbrance, that in all probability would in|volve
him in a thou&s;and difficulties and di&s;gu&s;ts.
Be&s;ides, he a&s;&s;ured him, that he was already, by
order of the lieutenant de police, &s;urrounded
with &s;pies, who would watch all his motions, and
immediately di&s;cover the retreat in which he
had depo&s;ited his prize. The&s;e arguments, and
the frank familiar manner in which they were
delivered, but above all, the la&s;t con&s;ideration, in|duced
the young gentleman to di&s;clo&s;e the whole
of his proceedings to the Emba&s;&s;ador, and pro|mi&s;e
to be governed by his direction, provided
the lady &s;hould not &s;uffer for the &s;tep &s;he had
taken, but be received by her hu&s;band with due
reverence and re&s;pect. The&s;e &s;tipulations being
agreed to, he undertook to produce her in eight
and forty hours; and taking coach immediately,
drove to the place of her re&s;idence, where he
&s;pent a whole day and a night in convincing her
of the impo&s;&s;ibility of their enjoying each other
in that manner; and returning to Paris, deli|vered
her into the hands of the Emba&s;&s;ador, who
having a&s;&s;ured her, that &s;he might depend upon
his friend&s;hip and protection, in ca&s;e &s;he &s;hould
find her&s;elf aggrieved by the jealous temper of
<PB N="58" REF="67">
Mr. Hornbeck, re&s;tored her to her legitimate
lord, whom he coun&s;elled to exempt her from
that re&s;traint which, in all probability, had been
the cau&s;e of her elopement, and endeavour to
conciliate her affection by tender and re&s;pectful
u&s;age.</P>
<P>The hu&s;band behaved with great humility and
compliance, prote&s;ting that his chief &s;tudy &s;hould
be to contrive parties for her plea&s;ure and &s;a|tisfaction.
But no &s;ooner did he regain po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion
of his &s;tray-&s;heep, than he locked her up
more clo&s;ely than ever; and after having re|volved
various &s;chemes for her reformation, de|termined
to board her in a convent, under the
in&s;pection of a prudent abbe&s;s, who &s;hould &s;u|perintend
her morals, and recal her to the paths
of virtue, which &s;he had for&s;aken. With this
view he con&s;ulted an Engli&s;h prie&s;t of his ac|quaintance,
who advi&s;ed him to &s;ettle her in a
mona&s;tery at Li&s;le, that &s;he might be as far as
po&s;&s;ible from the machinations of her lover; and
gave him a letter of recommendation to the &s;u|perior

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Peregrine re&s;olves to return to England, is diverted

<P>IN the mean time, our hero received a letter
from his aunt, importing that the commodore

&s;ee him at the gari&s;on; and at the &s;ame time he

pre&s;&s;ing in his &s;olicitations; &s;o that &s;he wanted to
know in what manner &s;he &s;hould an&s;wer his re|peated
intreaties. The&s;e two con&s;iderations de|termined
the young gentleman to return to his
native country, a re&s;olution that was far from
being di&s;agreeable to Jolter, who knew that the
incumbent on a living which was in the gift of
Trunnion, was extremely old, and that it would
be his intere&s;t to be upon the &s;pot at the &s;aid in|cumbent's
decea&s;e.</P>
<P>Peregrine, who had re&s;ided about fifteen
months in France, thought he was now &s;uffici|ently
qualified for eclip&s;ing mo&s;t of his cotempo|raries
in England, and therefore prepared for his
departure with infinite alacrity, being moreover
infl$med with the mo&s;t ardent de&s;ire of revi&s;iting
his friends, and renewing his connections, parti|cularly
with Emilia, who&s;e heart, he by this
time, thought he was able to reduce on his own
terms.</P>
<P>As he propo&s;ed to make the tour of Flanders
and Holland in his return to England, he re&s;olved
to &s;tay in Paris a week or two after his affairs
were &s;ettled, in hopes of finding &s;ome agreeable
companion di&s;po&s;ed for the &s;ame journey, and in
order to refre&s;h his memory, made a &s;econd cir|cuit
round all the places in that capital, where
any curious production of art is to be &s;een. In
the cour&s;e of this &s;econd examination he chanced
to enter the Palais Royal, ju&s;t as two gentlemen
alighted from a Fiacre at the gate, and all three
being admitted at the &s;ame time, he &s;oon per|ceived
<PB N="60" REF="69">
that the &s;trangers were of his own country.
One of them was a young man, in who&s;e air
and countenance appeared all the uncouth gravity
and &s;upercilious &s;elf-conceit of a phy&s;ician piping
hot from his &s;tudies, while the other, to whom
his companion &s;poke by the appellation of Mr.
Pallet, di&s;played at fir&s;t fight a &s;trange compo&s;i|tion
of levity and a&s;&s;urance. Indeed their cha|racters,
dre&s;s and addre&s;s were &s;trongly contra&s;ted;
the doctor wore a &s;uit of black, and a huge tye|wig,
neither &s;uitable to his own age, nor the fa|&s;hion
of the country where he then lived; where|as
the other, though &s;eemingly turned of fifty,
&s;trutted in a gay &s;ummer dre&s;s of the Pari&s;ian cut,
with a bag to his own grey hair, and a red feather
in his hat, which he carried under his arm. As
the&s;e figures &s;eemed to promi&s;e &s;omething enter|taining,
Pickle entered into conver&s;ation with
them immediately, and &s;oon di&s;covered that the
old gentleman was a painter from London, who
had &s;tole a fortnight from his occupation, in order
to vi&s;it the remarkable paintings of France and
Flanders; and that the doctor had taken the op|portunity
of accompanying him in his tour. Be|ing
extremely talkative, he not only communi|cated
the&s;e particulars to our hero in a very few
minutes after their meeting, but al&s;o took occa|&s;ion
to whi&s;per in his ear, that his fellow traveller
was a man of va&s;t learning, and beyond all doubt,
the greate&s;t poet of the age. As for him&s;elf, he
was under no nece&s;&s;ity of making his own elo|gium;
for he &s;oon gave &s;uch &s;pecimens of his
ta&s;te and talents, as left Pickle no room to doubt
of his capacity.</P>
<P>While they &s;tood con&s;idering the pictures in
one of the fir&s;t apartments, which are by no

means the mo&s;t ma&s;terly compo&s;itions, the Swi&s;s,
who &s;ets up for a connoi&s;&s;eur, looking at a cer|tain
piece, pronounced the word <HI>magnifique!</HI>
with a note of admiration; upon which Mr. Pal|let,
who was not at all a critick in the French
language, replied with great vivacity, &startq;<HI>Manu|fac,</HI>
you mean, and a very indifferent piece of
manufacture it is; pray gentleman take notice,
there is no keeping in tho&s;e heads upon the back
ground, nor no relief in the principal figure:
then you'll ob&s;erve the &s;hadings are har&s;h to the
la&s;t degree; and come a little clo&s;er this way&mdash;
don't you perceive that the fore-&s;hortening of that

Heark ye, Mr. what d'ye call um, (turn|ing
to the attendant) what is the name of the
dauber who painted that mi&s;erable performance?&endq;
The Swi&s;s imagining that he was all this time
expre&s;&s;ing his &s;atisfaction, &s;anctioned his &s;uppo&s;ed
commendation, by exclaiming <HI>&s;ans prix.</HI> &startq;Right,
cried Pallet, I could not recollect his name,
though his manner is quite familiar to me. We
have a few pieces in England, done by that &s;ame
&s;angpree; but there they are in no e&s;timation;
we have more ta&s;te among us, than to reli&s;h the
productions of &s;uch a mi&s;erable gout. Isn't he an
ignorant coxcomb, doctor?&endq; The phy&s;ician a|&s;hamed
of his companion's blunder, thought it
was nece&s;&s;ary for the honour of his own charac|ter,
to take notice of it before the &s;tranger, and
therefore an&s;wered his que&s;tion, by repeating this
line from Horace,
<Q><HI>Mutato nomine, de te fabula narratur.</HI></Q></P>
<P><PB N="62" REF="71">
The painter, who was rather more ignorant of
Latin than of French, taking it for granted that
this quotation of his friend, conveyed an a&s;&s;ent to
his opinion, &startq;Very true, &s;aid he, a mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible
ob&s;ervation! mute aye toe numbing he, (what
is't?) Deity, fable honour hate her. It is indeed
a mo&s;t mute benumbing piece; and the fable
&s;hews that the painter was very little honoured
by the deity.&endq; Peregrine was a&s;toni&s;hed at this
&s;urpri&s;ing perver&s;ion of the words and meaning of
a Latin line, which, at fir&s;t, he could not help
thinking was a premeditated joke; but upon
&s;econd thoughts, he &s;aw no rea&s;on to doubt that
it was the extemporaneous effect of &s;heer pertne&s;s
and ignorance, at which he broke out into an
immoderate fit of laughter. Pallet believing that
the gentleman's mirth was occa&s;ioned by his arch
animadver&s;ion upon the work of &s;angpree, un|derwent
the &s;ame emotion in a much louder
&s;train, and endeavoured to heighten the je&s;t, by
more ob&s;ervations of the &s;ame nature; while the
doctor confounded at his impudence and want of
knowledge, reprimanded him in the&s;e words of
Homer,
<Q><GAP DESC="FOREIGN"></Q></P>
<P>This rebuke, the reader will ea&s;ily perceive, was
not calculated for the meridian of his friend's intel|lects,
but uttered with a view of rai&s;ing his own
character in the opinion of Mr. Pickle, who retorted
this parade of learning in three ver&s;es from the
&s;ame author, being part of the &s;peech of Polyda|mas
to Hector, importing that it is impo&s;&s;ible for
one man to excel in every thing. The &s;elf-&s;uffi|cient
phy&s;ician, who did not expect &s;uch a repar|tee
<PB N="63" REF="72">
from a youth of Peregrine's appearance,
looked upon his reply as a fair challenge, and in|&s;tantly
rehear&s;ed forty or fifty lines of the Iliad in
a breath; and ob&s;erving that the &s;tranger made
no effort to match this effu&s;ion, interpreted his
&s;ilence into &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion; then, in order to a&s;cer|tain
his victory, in&s;ulted him with divers frag|ments
of authors, whom his &s;uppo&s;ed competitor
did not even know by name; while Mr. Pallet
&s;tared with admiration at the profound &s;cholar&s;hip
of his companion. Our young gentleman, far
from repining at this &s;uperiority, laughed within
him&s;elf at the ridiculous ambition of the pedan|tic
doctor, who mu&s;t have been at infinite pains
in conning the&s;e detached pieces, with a view of
retailing them in company for the credit of his
genius and knowledge. He rated him in his own
mind as a meer index-hunter, who held the eel of
&s;cience by the tail, and fore&s;aw an infinite fund of
diver&s;ion in his &s;olemnity and pride, if properly
extracted by means of his fellow-traveller's vanity
and a&s;&s;urance. Prompted by the&s;e con&s;iderations,
he re&s;olved to cultivate their acquaintance, and, if
po&s;&s;ible, amu&s;e him&s;elf at their expence in his
journey through Flanders, under&s;tanding that they
were determined upon the &s;ame route. In this
view he treated them with extraordinary atten|tion,
and &s;eemed to pay particular deference to
the remarks of the painter, who with great intre|pidity
pronounced judgment upon every picture in
the palace, or in other words, expo&s;ed his own
nakedne&s;s, in every &s;entence that proceeded from
his mouth.</P>
<P>When they came to con&s;ider the murder of the
innocents by Le Brun, the Swi&s;s ob&s;erved that it
was <HI>un beau mor$eau,</HI> and Mr. Pallet replied,
<PB N="64" REF="73">
&startq;Yes, yes, one may &s;ee with half an eye, that
it can be the production of no other; for Bomor|&s;o's
&s;tile, both in colouring and drapery, is alto|gether
peculiar; then his de&s;ign is tame, and his
expre&s;&s;ion antic and unnatural. Doctor, you$
have &s;een my judgment of Solomon, I think I
may without pre&s;umption&mdash;but, I don't choo&s;e
to make compari&s;ons, I leave that odious ta&s;k to
other people, and let my works &s;peak for them|&s;elves.
France, to be &s;ure, is rich in the arts,
but what is the rea&s;on? the king encourages men
of genius with honour and rewards: whereas, in
England, we are obliged to &s;tand upon our own
feet, and combat the envy and malice of our
brethren; agad! I have a good mind to come
and &s;ettle here in Paris; I &s;hould like to have an
apartment in the Louvre, with a &s;nug pen&s;ion of
&s;o many thou&s;and livres.&endq; In this manner did
Pallet proceed with an eternal rotation of tongue,
floundering from one mi&s;take to another, until it
was the turn of Pou&s;&s;in's &s;even &s;acraments to be
examined. Here again the Swi&s;s out of the abun|dance
of his zeal, expre&s;&s;ed his admiration, by
&s;aying, the&s;e pieces were <HI>impayable;</HI> when the
painter turning to him with an air of exultation,
&startq;Pardon me, friend, there you happen to be
mi&s;taken, the&s;e are none of <HI>impayable's,</HI> but done
by Nicholas Pou&s;een. I have &s;een prints of them
in England, &s;o that none of your tricks upon tra|vellers,
Mr. Swi&s;h or Swa&s;h, or what's your
name. He was very much elated by this imaginary
triumph of his under&s;tanding, which animated
him to per&s;evere in his curious ob&s;ervations upon
all the other pieces of that celebrated collection;
but perceiving that the doctor manife&s;ted no &s;igns
of plea&s;ure and &s;atisfaction, but rather beheld
<PB N="65" REF="74">
them with a &s;ilent air of di&s;dain, he could not
dige&s;t his indifference, and a&s;ked with a waggi&s;h
&s;neer, if ever he had &s;een &s;uch a number of ma|&s;ter-pieces
before? The phy&s;ician eying him with
a look of compa&s;&s;ion mingled with contempt, ob|&s;erved
that there was nothing there which de|&s;erved
the attention of any per&s;on acquainted with
the ideas of the ancients; and that the author of
the fine&s;t piece now in being, was unworthy to
clean the bru&s;hes of one of tho&s;e great ma&s;ters,
who are celebrated by the Greek and Roman
writers. &startq;O lud! O lud! (exclaimed the
painter, with a loud laugh) you have fairly
brought your&s;elf into a dilemma at la&s;t, dear doc|tor;
for it is well known that your ancient Greek
and Roman arti&s;ts knew nothing at all of the
matter, in compari&s;on with our modern ma&s;ters;
for this good rea&s;on, becau&s;e they had but three
or four colours, and knew not how to paint with
$word$ be&s;ides, which of all your old fu&s;ty Grecians
would you put upon a footing with the divine
Raphael, the mo&s;t excellent Michael Angelo, Bona
Ro$, the graceful Guido, the bewitching Titian,
and above all others, the &s;ublime Rubens, the&endq;
&mdash;He would have proceeded with a long ca|talogue
of names which he had got by heart for
the purpo&s;e, without retaining the lea&s;t idea of
their &s;everal qualifications, had not he been in|terrupted
by his friend, who&s;e indignation being
kindled by the irreverence with which he men|tioned
the Greeks; he called him bla&s;phemer,
Goth, Baeotian, and in his turn, a&s;ked with great
vehemence, which of tho&s;e puny moderns could
match with Panaenus of Athens, and his brother
Phidias, Polycletus of Sicyon, Polygnotus the
<PB N="66" REF="75">
Thra&s;ian, Parrha&s;ius of Ephe&s;us, &s;irnamed <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">,
and Apelles the prince of painters? He
challenged him to &s;hew any portrait of the&s;e days
that could vye with the Helen of Zeuxis the He|raclean,
or any compo&s;ition equal to the &s;acrifice
of Iphigenia, by Timanthes the Sicyonian; not
to mention the twelve gods of A&s;clepiadorus the
Athenian, for which Mna&s;on, tyrant of Elatea,
gave him about three hundred pounds a piece, or
Homer's hell by Nicias, who refu&s;ed &s;ixty talents,
amounting to upwards of eleven thou&s;and pounds,
and generou&s;ly made a pre&s;ent of it to his own
country. He de&s;ired him to produce a collection
equal to that in the temple of Delphos, men|tioned
in the <GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> of Euripedes; where Hercules
and his companion Iolaus are repre&s;ented in the
act of killing the Lernaean hydra, with golden
&s;ickles <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, where Bellerophon appears
upon his winged &s;teed, vanqui&s;hing the fire-breath|ing

was a&s;toni&s;hed and confounded at this rhap&s;ody of
names and in&s;tances, which was uttered with
&s;urpri&s;ing eagerne&s;s and rapidity; &s;u&s;pecting at
fir&s;t that the whole was the creation of his own
brain; but when Pickle, with a view of flatter|ing
the doctor's &s;elf-conceit, e&s;pou&s;ed his &s;ide of
the que&s;tion, and confirmed the truth of every
thing he advanced, Mr. Pallet changed his opi|nion,
and in emphatic &s;ilence adored the immen|&s;ity
of his friend's under&s;tanding. In &s;hort, Pe|regrine
<PB N="67" REF="76">
ea&s;ily perceived that they were fal&s;e en|thu&s;ia&s;ts,
without the &s;malle&s;t preten&s;ions to ta&s;te
and &s;en&s;ibility; and pretended to be in raptures
with they knew not what; the one thinking it
was incumbent upon him to expre&s;s tran&s;ports on
&s;eeing the works of tho&s;e who had been mo&s;t
eminent in his profe&s;&s;ion, whether they did or
did not really rai&s;e his admiration; and the other
as a &s;cholar deeming it his duty to magni&s;y the an|cients
above all competition, with an affected fer|vour,
which the knowledge of their excellencies
never in&s;pired. Indeed our young gentleman &s;o
&s;ucce&s;sfully accommodated him&s;elf to the di&s;po|&s;ition
of each, that long before their review
was fini&s;hed, he was become a particular favourite
with both.</P>
<P>From the Palais Royal he accompanied them to
the clo$&s;ters of the Carthu&s;ians, where they con|&s;idered
the hi&s;tory of St. Bruno, by Le Sueur,
who&s;e name being utterly unknown to the painter,
he gave judgment again&s;t the whole compo&s;ition,
as pitiful and paultry; though in the opinion of
all good judges, it is a mo&s;t ma&s;terly performance.</P>
<P>Having &s;atisfied their curio&s;ity in this place,
Peregrine &s;ollicited them to favour him with their
company at dinner; but whether out of caution
again&s;t the in&s;inuations of one who&s;e character
they did not know, or by rea&s;on of a prior en|gagement,
they declined his invitation on pretence
of having an appointment at a certain ordinary,
though they expre&s;&s;ed a de&s;ire of being farther ac|quainted
with him; and Mr. Pallet took the free|dom
of a&s;king his name, which he not only de|clared,
but promi&s;ed, as they were &s;trangers in

in order to conduct them to the hotel de

Tholou&s;e, and the hou&s;es of &s;everal other noble|men,
remarkable for painting or curious furni|ture.
They thankfully embraced his propo&s;al,
and that &s;ame day made inquiry among the Engli&s;h
gentlemen, about the character of our hero, which
they found &s;o much to their &s;atisfaction, that upon
their &s;econd meeting, they courted his good graces
without re&s;erve; and as they had heard of his in|tended
departure, begged earne&s;tly to have the ho|nour
of accompanying him through the Low Coun|tries.
He a&s;&s;ured them that nothing could be

and company, diametrically oppo&s;ite in poli|tical
maxims; the one, as we have already ob|&s;erved,
being a bigotted high churchman, and the
<PB N="69" REF="78">
other a rank republican. It was an article of the
governor's creed, that the people could not be
happy, nor the earth yield its fruits in abundance,
under a re&s;tricted clergy and limited government:
whereas, in the doctor's opinion, it was an eter|nal
truth, that no con&s;titution was &s;o perfect as
the democracy, and that no country could flouri&s;h,
but under the admini&s;tration of the mob.</P>
<P>The&s;e con&s;iderations being premi&s;ed, no won|der
that they happened to di&s;agree in the freedom
of an unre&s;erved conver&s;ation, e&s;pecially as their
entertainer took all opportunities of encouraging
and inflaming the contention. The fir&s;t &s;ource
of their difference was an unlucky remark of the
painter, who ob&s;erved that the partridge of which
he was then eating, had the fine&s;t reli&s;h of any
he had ever ta&s;ted. His friend owned that the
birds were the be&s;t of the kind he had &s;een in
France; but affirmed that they were neither &s;o
plump nor delicious as tho&s;e that were caught in
England. The governor con&s;idering this ob&s;er|vation
as the effect of prejudice and inexperience,
&s;aid with a &s;arca&s;tical &s;mile, &startq;I believe, &s;ir, you
are very well di&s;po&s;ed to find every thing here in|ferior
to the productions of your own country.&endq;
&startq;True, &s;ir, (an&s;wered the phy&s;ician with a cer|tain
&s;olemnity of a&s;pect) and not without good
rea&s;on I hope.&endq; &startq;And pray, (re&s;umed the
tutor) why may not the partridges of France be
as good as tho&s;e of England?&endq; &startq;For a very
plain rea&s;on, replied the other, becau&s;e they are
not &s;o well fed. The iron hand of oppre&s;&s;ion is
extended to all animals within the French domi|nions,
even to the bea&s;ts of the field and the fowls
of the air. <HI>Kune&s;&s;in ownoi&s;i te pa&s;t.&endq;</HI> &startq;Egad!
cried the painter, that is a truth not to be con|troverted:
<PB N="70" REF="79">
for my own part, I am none of your
tit-bits, one would think, but yet there's a fre&s;h|ne&s;s
in the Engli&s;h complexion, a <HI>gin&s;eekeye,</HI> I
think you call it, &s;o inviting to a hungry French|man,
that I have caught &s;everal in the very act
of viewing me with an eye of extreme appetite,
as I pa&s;&s;ed; and as for their curs, or rather their
wolves, (for by jingo they are more liker the one
than t'other) whenever I &s;et eyes on one of 'em,
Aha! your humble &s;ervant Mr. &s;on of a bitch, I
am upon my guard in an in&s;tant. The doctor
can te&s;tify that their very hor&s;es, or more pro|perly
their live carrion that drew our chai&s;e, u&s;ed
to reach back their long necks and &s;mell at us,
as a couple of delicious mor&s;els.&endq; This &s;ally of
Mr. Pallet, which was received with a general
laugh of approbation, would, in all probability,
have &s;tifled the di&s;pute in embrio, had not Mr.
Jolter with a &s;elf-applauding &s;imper, ironically
complimented the &s;trangers on their talking like
true Engli&s;hmen. The doctor affronted at the
in&s;inuation, told him with &s;ome warmth, that he
was mi&s;taken in his conjecture, his affections and
ideas being confined to no particular country; for
he con&s;idered him&s;elf as a citizen of the world.
He owned him&s;elf more attached to England than
to any other kingdom, but this preference was
the effect of reflexion, and not of prejudice; be|cau&s;e
the Briti&s;h con&s;titution approached nearer
than any other, to that perfection of government,
the democracy of Athens, which he hoped one
day to &s;ee revived: he mentioned the death of
Charles the fir&s;t, and the expul&s;ion of his &s;on, with
raptures of applau&s;e, inveighed with great acri|mony
again&s;t the kingly name; and in order to
fanction his opinion, repeated forty or fifty lines
<PB N="71" REF="80">
from one of the Philippicks of Demo&s;thenes. Jol|ter
hearing him &s;peak &s;o di&s;re&s;pectfully of the
higher powers, glowed with indignation. He
&s;aid his doctrines were dete&s;table and de&s;tructive
of all right, order and &s;ociety; that monarchy
was of divine in&s;titution, therefore indefea&s;ible by
any human power; and of con&s;equence tho&s;e
events in the Engli&s;h hi&s;tory, which he had &s;o
liberally commended, were no other than flagrant
in&s;tances of &s;acrilege, perfidy, and &s;edition;
that the democracy of Athens was a mo&s;t ab&s;urd
con&s;titution, productive of anarchy and mi&s;chief,
which mu&s;t always happen when the government
of a nation depends upon the caprice of the ig|norant
hair-brained vulgar: that it was in the
power of the mo&s;t pro&s;ligate member of the com|mon-wealth,
provided he was endowed with elo|quence,
to ruin the mo&s;t de&s;erving, by a de&s;pe|rate
exertion of his talents upon the populace,
who had been often per&s;uaded to act in the mo&s;t
ungrateful and imprudent manner, again&s;t the
greate&s;t patriots that their country had produced:
and finally, he averred, that the liberal arts and
&s;ciences had never flouri&s;hed &s;o much in a repub|lick,
as under the encouragement and protection
of ab&s;olute power; witne&s;s the Augu&s;tan age, and
the reign of Lewis the fourteenth: nor was it to
be &s;uppo&s;ed that genius and merit could ever be &s;o
amply recompen&s;ed by the individuals, or di&s;tracted
councils of a common-wealth, as by the genero|&s;ity
and magnificence of one, who had the whole
trea&s;ures at his own command.</P>
<P>Peregrine, who was plea&s;ed to find the conte&s;t
grow warm, ob&s;erved that there &s;eemed to be a
good deal of truth in what Mr. Jolter advanced;
and the painter, who&s;e opinion began to waver,
<PB N="72" REF="81">
looked with a face of expectation at his friend,
who modelling his features into an expre&s;&s;ion of
exulting di&s;dain, a&s;ked of his antagoni&s;t, if he
did not think that very power of rewarding me|rit,
enabled an ab&s;olute prince to indulge him&s;elf
in the mo&s;t arbitrary licence over the lives and
fortunes of his people? Before the governor had
time to an&s;wer this que&s;tion, Pallet broke forth
into an exclamation of &startq;By the Lord! that is
certainly fact, egad! that was a home thru&s;t, doc|tor.&endq;
When Mr. Jolter cha&s;ti&s;ing this &s;hallow
intruder with a contempt'ous look, affirmed that
though &s;upreme power furni&s;hed a good prince
with the means of exerting his virtues, it would
not &s;upport a tyrant in the exerci&s;e of cruelty and
oppre&s;&s;ion; becau&s;e in all nations, the genius of
the people mu&s;t be con&s;ulted by their governors,
and the burthen proportioned to the &s;houlders on
which it is laid, &startq;El&s;e, what follows?&endq; &s;aid the
phy&s;ician, &startq;The con&s;equence is plain, replied
the governor, in&s;urrection, revolt, and his own
de&s;truction: for it is not to be &s;uppo&s;ed that the
&s;ubjects of any nation would be &s;o abject and pu|&s;ilanimous,
as to neglect the means which heaven
hath put in their power for their own pre&s;erva|tion.&endq;
&startq;Gadzooks! you're in the right, &s;ir,
cried Pallet, that I grant you mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed:
doctor, I'm afraid we have got into the wrong
box.&endq; This &s;on of Paean, however, far from
being of his friend's opinion, ob&s;erved with an air
of triumph, that he would not only demon&s;trate
the &s;ophi&s;try of the gentleman's la&s;t allegation,
by argument and facts, but even confute him with
his own words. Jolter's eyes kindling at this
pre&s;umptuous declaration, he told his antagoni&s;t,
while his lip quivered with re&s;entment, that if his
<PB N="73" REF="82">
arguments were no better than his breeding, he
was &s;ure he would make very few converts to
his opinion; and the doctor, with all the in&s;olence
of triumph, advi&s;ed him to beware of di&s;putes for
the future, until he &s;hould have made him&s;elf
more ma&s;ter of his &s;ubject.</P>
<P>Peregrine both wi&s;hed and hoped to &s;ee the di&s;|putants
proceed to arguments of more weight and
conviction; and the painter dreading the &s;ame
i&s;&s;ue, interpo&s;ed with the u&s;ual exclamation of
&startq;For God's &s;ake, gentlemen!&endq; when the gover|nor
ro&s;e from table in great dudgeon, and left the
room, muttering &s;ome ejaculation, of which the
word coxcomb only could be di&s;tinctly heard.
The phy&s;ician being thus left ma&s;ter of the field
of battle, was complimented on his victory by
Peregrine, and &s;o elevated by his &s;ucce&s;s, that
he declaimed a full hour on the ab&s;urdity of Jol|ter's
propo&s;ition, and the beauty of the demo|cratic
admini&s;tration; canva&s;&s;ed the whole &s;cheme
of Plato's republic, with many quotations from
that ideal author; touching the <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">: from
thence he made a tran&s;ition to the moral &s;en&s;e of
Sha&s;t&s;bury, and concluded his harangue with the
greate&s;t part of that frothy writer's rhap&s;ody,
which he repeated with all the violence of enthu|&s;ia&s;tic
agitation; to the un&s;peakable &s;atisfaction of
his entertainer, and the unutterable admiration
of Pallet, who looked upon him as &s;omething
&s;upernatural and divine. So intoxicated was this
vain young man with the ironical prai&s;es of
Pickle, that he forthwith &s;hook off all re&s;erve, and
having profe&s;&s;ed a friend&s;hip for our hero, who&s;e
ta&s;te and learning he did not fail to extol, inti|nated
in plain terms, that he was the only per&s;on
<PB N="74" REF="83">
in the&s;e latter ages, who profe&s;&s;ed that &s;ublime
genius, that portion of the divinity or <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">,
which immortalized the Grecian poets; that as
Pythagoras affirmed the &s;pirit of Euphorbus had
tran&s;migrated into his body, he, the doctor, was
&s;trangely po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with the opinion that he him|&s;elf
was in&s;pired by the &s;oul of Pindar; becau&s;e,
making allowance for the difference of languages,
in which they wrote, there was a &s;urpri&s;ing affi|nity
between his own works and tho&s;e of that cele|brated
Theban; and as a confirmation of this truth,
he immediately produced a &s;ample of each, which
though in &s;pirit and ver&s;ification, as different as
the Odes of Horace and our pre&s;ent laureat, Pe|regrine
did not &s;cruple to pronounce altogether
congenial; notwith&s;tanding the violence he by
this &s;entence offered to his own con&s;cience, and a
certain alarm of his pride, that was weak enough
to be di&s;turbed by the phy&s;ician's ridiculous va|nity
and pre&s;umption, which not contented with
di&s;playing his importance in the world of ta&s;te and
polite literature, manife&s;ted it&s;elf in arrogating
certain material di&s;coveries in the province of phy|&s;ick,
which could not fail to advance him to the
highe&s;t pinnacle of that profe&s;&s;ion, con&s;idering
the recommendation of his other talents, together
with a liberal fortune which he inherited from his
father.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XLVIII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">The doctor prepares an entertainment in the manner
of the ancients, which is attended with divers
ridiculous circum&s;tances.</HEAD>
<P>IN a word, our young gentleman, by his in|&s;inuating
behaviour, obtained the full confi|dence
of the doctor, who invited him to an en|tertainment,
which he intended to prepare in the
manner of the ancients. Pickle, &s;truck with
this idea, eagerly embraced the propo&s;al, which
he honoured with many encomiums, as a plan
in all re&s;pects worthy of his genius and appre|hen&s;ion;
and the day was appointed at &s;ome di|&s;tance
of time, that the treater might have lei|&s;ure
to compo&s;e certain pickles and confections
which were not to be found among the culinary
preparations of the&s;e degenerate days.</P>
<P>With a view of rendering the phy&s;ician's ta&s;te
more con&s;picuous, and extracting from it the
more diver&s;ion, Peregrine propo&s;ed that &s;ome fo|reigners
&s;hould partake of the banquet; and the
ta&s;k being left to his care and di&s;cretion, he ac|tually
be&s;poke the company of a French marquis,
an Italian count and a German baron, whom he
knew to be egregious coxcombs, and therefore
more likely to enhance the joy of the entertain|ment.</P>
<P>Accordingly, the hour being arrived, he con|ducted
them to the hotel where the phy&s;ician
lodged, after having regaled their expectations with
an elegant meal in the genuine old Roman ta&s;te;
and they were received by Mr. Pallet, who did
the honours of the hou&s;e, while his friend &s;uper|intended
<PB N="76" REF="85">
the roti&s;&s;eur below. By this communi|cative
painter, the gue&s;ts under&s;tood that the doctor
had met with numerous difficulties in the execution
of his de&s;ign; that no fewer than five cooks had been
di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, becau&s;e they could not prevail upon
their own con&s;ciences to obey his directions in
things that were contrary to the pre&s;ent practice
of their art; and that although he had at la&s;t en|gaged
a per&s;on, by an extraordinary premium,
to comply with his orders, the fellow was &s;o
a&s;toni&s;hed, mortified and incen&s;ed at the com|mands
he had received, that his hair &s;tood on
end, and he begged on his knees, to be relea&s;ed
from the agreement he had made: but finding
that his employer in&s;i&s;ted upon the performance
of his contract, and threatened to introduce him
to the commi&s;&s;aire, if he &s;hould flinch from the
bargain, he had, in the di&s;charge of his office,
wept, &s;ung, cur&s;ed and capered for two whole
hours without intermi&s;&s;ion; &s;o that his brain
&s;eemed to have received a rude &s;hock, and, in
all probability, he would never be his own man
again.</P>
<P>While the company li&s;tened to this odd infor|mation,
by which they were prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with
&s;trange notions of the dinner, their ears were
invaded by a piteous voice that exclaimed in
French, &startq;For the love of God! dear Sir! for
the pa&s;&s;ion of Je&s;us Chri&s;t! &s;pare me the morti|fication
of the honey and oil!&endq; But this pa|thetic
&s;upplication having no effect upon the
phy&s;ician, who in all likelihood poured in, with
his own hand, the &s;auce again&s;t which the coo$
had objected, the &s;ame voice was heard to utter
a &s;ort of yell, which was followed by a &s;tring $word$
execrations in the French language, that gra|dually
<PB N="77" REF="86">
died away, as if the &s;wearer had been for|cibly
conveyed into a more di&s;tant apartment.
Their ears &s;till vibrated with the &s;ound, when
the doctor entering, was by Peregrine made ac|quainted
with the &s;trangers, to whom he, in the
tran&s;ports of his wrath, could not help of com|plaining
of the want of complai&s;ance he had found
in the Pari&s;ian vulgar, by which his plan had,
been almo&s;t entirely ruined and &s;et a&s;ide. The
French marquis, who thought the honour of his
nation was concerned at this declaration, pro|fe&s;&s;ed
his &s;orrow for what had happened, &s;o con|trary
to the e&s;tabli&s;hed character of the people,
and undertook to &s;ee the delinquents &s;everely pu|ni&s;hed,
provided he could be informed of their
names or places of abode. The mutual compli|ments
that pa&s;&s;ed on this occa&s;ion were &s;carce
fini&s;hed, when a &s;ervant coming into the room,
announced dinner; and the entertainer led the
way into another apartment, where they found
a long table, or rather two boards joined toge|ther,
and furni&s;hed with a variety or di&s;hes, the
&s;teams of which had &s;uch evident effect upon the
nerves of the company, that the marquis made
frightful grimaces, under pretence of taking &s;nuff;
the Italian's eyes watered, the German's vi&s;age
underwent violent di&s;tortion of features; our hero
found means to exclude the odour from his &s;en&s;e
of &s;melling, by breathing only through his mouth;
and the poor painter running into another room,
plugged his no&s;trils with tobacco. The doctor
him&s;elf, who was the only per&s;on then pre&s;ent
who&s;e organs were not di&s;compo&s;ed, pointing to
a couple of couches placed on each &s;ide of the
table, told his gue&s;ts, that he was &s;orry he could
not procure the exact <HI>triclinia</HI> of the ancients;
<PB N="78" REF="87">
which were &s;omewhat different from the&s;e con|veniencies,
and de&s;ired they would have the good|ne&s;s
to repo&s;e them&s;elves without ceremony, each
in his re&s;pective couchette, while he and his
friend Mr. Pallet would place them&s;elves upright
at the ends, that they might have the plea&s;ure of
&s;erving tho&s;e that lay along. This di&s;po&s;ition,
of which the &s;trangers had no previous idea, di&s;|concerted
and perplexed them in a mo&s;t ridicu|lous
manner; the marquis and baron &s;tood bow|ing
to each other, on pretence of di&s;puting the
lower &s;eat, but in reality with a view of profiting
by the example of one another, for neither of
them under&s;tood the manner in which they were
to $oll; and Peregrine, who enjoyed their confu|&s;ion,
handed the count to the other &s;ide, where,
with the mo&s;t mi&s;chievous politene&s;s, he in&s;i&s;ted
upon his taking po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the upper place.</P>
<P>In this di&s;agreeable and ludicrous &s;u&s;pence they
continued acting a pantomime of ge&s;ticulations,
until the doctor earne&s;tly intreated them to wave
all compl$ment and form, left the dinner &s;hould
be &s;poiled before the ceremonial could be ad|ju&s;ted.
Thus conjured, Peregrine took the lower
$$uch on the left-hand &s;ide, laying him&s;elf gently
down, with his face towards the table. The
marquis, in imitation of this pattern (though he
would have much rather fa&s;ted three days than
run the ri&s;k of di&s;compo&s;ing his dre&s;s by &s;uch an
attitude) &s;tretched him&s;elf upon the oppo&s;ite place,
reclining upon his elbow in a mo&s;t painful and
aukward &s;ituation, with his head rai&s;ed above the
end of the couch, that the oeconomy of his hair
might not &s;uffer by the projection of his body.
The Italian being a thin, limber creature, planted
him&s;elf next to Pickle, without &s;u&s;taining any
<PB N="79" REF="88">
misfortune, but that of his &s;tocking being tor$$
by a ragged nail of the &s;eat, as he rai&s;ed his legs
on a level with the re&s;t of his limbs. But the
baron, who was neither &s;o wieldy nor &s;upple in
his joints as his companions, flounced him&s;elf
down with &s;uch precipitation, that $is feet &s;ud|denly
tilting up, came in furious contact with
the head of the marquis, and demoli&s;hed every
curl in a twinkling, while his own &s;kull, at the
&s;ame in&s;tant, de&s;cended upon the &s;ide of his couch
with &s;uch violence, that his periwig was &s;truck
off, and the whole room filled with pulvilio.</P>
<P>The drollery of di&s;tre&s;s that attended this di&s;|a&s;ter
entirely vanqui&s;hed the affected gravity of
our young gentleman, who was obliged to &s;up|pre&s;s
his laughter by cramming his handkerchief
in his mouth; for the bare-headed German a&s;ked
pardon with &s;uch ridiculous confu&s;ion, and the
marquis admitted his apology with &s;uch rueful
complai&s;ance, as were &s;ufficient to awake the
mi$th of a quieti&s;t, who&s;e in&s;en&s;ibility was not
utterly extingui&s;hed.</P>
<P>This misfortune being repaired as well as the
circum&s;tances of the occa&s;ion would permit, and
every one &s;ettled according to the arrangement
already de&s;cribed, the doctor graciou&s;ly under|took
to give &s;ome account of the di&s;hes as they
occurred, that the company might be directed in
their choice; and with an air of infinite &s;ati&s;|faction
thus began: &startq;This here, gentlemen, is
a boiled goo&s;e, &s;erved up in a &s;auce compo&s;ed of
pepper, lovage, coriander, mint, rue, anchovies
and oil; I wi&s;h for your &s;akes, gentlemen, it
was one of the gee&s;e of Ferrara, &s;o much cele|brated
among the ancients for the magnitude of
their livers, one of which is &s;aid to have weighed
<PB N="80" REF="89">
upwards of two pounds: with this food, exqui&s;ite
as it was, did the tyrant Heliogabalus regale his
hounds. But I beg pardon, I had almo&s;t forgot
the &s;oup, which I hear is &s;o nece&s;&s;ary an article
at all tables in France. At each end there
are di&s;hes of the &s;alacacabia of the Romans, one
is made of par&s;ley, pennyroyal, chee&s;e, pine|tops,
honey, vinegar, brine, eggs, cucumbers,
onions and hen-livers; the other is much the
&s;ame as the &s;oup-maigre of this country. Then
there is a loin of veal boiled with fennel and ca|raway-feed,
on a pottage compo&s;ed of pickle,
oil, honey and flour, and a curious hachis of the
lights, liver and blood of an hare, together with
a di&s;h of roa&s;ted pigeons. Mon&s;ieur le baron,
&s;hall I help you to a plate of this &s;oup?&endq; The
German, who did not at all di&s;approve of the in|gredients,
a&s;&s;ented to the propo&s;al, and &s;eemed
to reli&s;h the compo&s;ition; while the marquis, be|ing
a&s;ked by the painter which of the &s;illy-kickabys
he cho&s;e, was in con&s;equence of his de|&s;ire
accommodated with a portion of the &s;oup
maigre; and the count, in lieu of &s;poon-meat, of
which he &s;aid he was no great admirer, &s;upplied
him&s;elf with a pigeon, therein conforming to
the choice of our young gentleman, who&s;e ex|ample
he determined to follow through the whole
cour&s;e of the entertainment.</P>
<P>The Frenchman having &s;wallowed the fir&s;t
&s;poonful, made a full pau&s;e, his throat &s;welled,
as if an egg had &s;tuck in his gullet, his eyes
rolled, and his mouth underwent a &s;eries of in|voluntary
contractions and dilatations. Pallet,
who looked &s;tedfa&s;tly at this connoi&s;&s;eur, with a
view of con&s;ulting his ta&s;te, before he him&s;elf
would venture upon the &s;oup, began to be di|&s;turbed
<PB N="81" REF="90">
at the&s;e emotions, and ob&s;erved with
&s;ome concern, that the poor gentleman &s;eemed to
be going into a fit; when Peregrine a&s;&s;ured him
that the&s;e were &s;ymptoms of exta&s;y, and for fur|ther
confirmation, a&s;ked the marquis how he
found the &s;oup. It was with infinite difficulty
that his complai&s;ance could &s;o far ma&s;ter his di&s;|gu&s;t,
as to enable him to an&s;wer, &startq;Altogether
excellent, upon my honour!&endq; And the painter
being certified of his approbation, lifted the &s;poon
to his mouth without &s;cruple; but, far from
ju&s;tifying the elogium of his ta&s;ter, when this
precious compo&s;ition diffu&s;ed it&s;elf upon his pa|late,
he &s;eemed to be deprived of all &s;en&s;e and
motion, and &s;at like the leaden &s;tatue of &s;ome
river god, with the liquor flowing out at both
&s;ides of his mouth.</P>
<P>The doctor, alarmed at this indecent phoeno|menon,
earne&s;tly inquired into the cau&s;e of it;
and when Pallet recovered his recollection, and
&s;were that he would rather &s;wallow porridge made
of burning brim&s;tone, than &s;uch an infernal m$&s;s
as that which he had ta&s;ted, the phy&s;ician, in his
own vindication, a&s;&s;ured the company, that, ex|cept
the u&s;ual ingredients, he had mixed nothing
in the &s;oup but &s;ome &s;al armoniac in&s;tead of the
ancient nitrum, which could not now be pro|cured;
and appealed to the marquis, whether
&s;uch a &s;uccedaneum was not an improvement on
the whole. The unfortunate petit maitre, dri|ven
to the extremity of his conde&s;cen&s;ion, ac|knowledged
it to be a ma&s;t$$ly refinement; and
deeming him&s;elf obliged, in point of honour, to
$$ince his &s;entiments by $word$ practice, forced a
few more mouthfuls of this di&s;agreeable potion
down his throat, till his &s;tomach was &s;o much
<PB N="82" REF="91">
offended, that he was compelled to &s;tart up of a
&s;udden, and in the hurry of his elevation over|turned
his plate into the bo&s;om of the baron.
The emergency of his occa&s;ions would not per|mit
him to &s;tay and make apologies for this abrupt
behaviour, &s;o that he flew into another apart|ment,
where Pickle found him puking, and
cro&s;&s;ing him&s;elf with great devotion; and a chair,
at his de&s;ire, being brought to the door, he &s;lipt
into it more dead than alive, conjuring his friend
Pickle to make his peace with the company, and
in particular excu&s;e him to the baron, on account
of the violent fit of illne&s;s with which he had
been &s;eized. It was not without rea&s;on that he
employed a mediator; for when our hero re|turned
to the dining-room, the German got up,
and was under the hands of his own lacquey,
who wiped the grea&s;e from a rich embroidered
wai&s;tcoat, while he, almo&s;t frantic with his mi&s;|fortune,
&s;tamped upon the ground, and in High
Dutch cur&s;ed the unlucky banquet, and the im|pertinent
entertainer, who all this time, with
great deliberation, con&s;oled him for the di&s;a&s;ter,
by a&s;&s;uring him, that the damage might be re|paired
with &s;ome oil of turpentine and an hot
iron. Peregrine, who could &s;carce refrain from
laughing in his face, appea&s;ed his indignation,
by telling him how much the whole company,
and e&s;pecially the marquis, was mortified at the
accident; and the unhappy &s;alacacabia being re|moved,
the places were filled with two pies,
one of dormice liquored with &s;yrup of white po$|pies,
which the doctor had &s;ub&s;tituted in the room
of toa&s;ted poppy-&s;eed, formerly eaten with ho|ney,
as a de&s;ert; and the other compo&s;ed of an
hock of pork baked in honey.</P>
<P><PB N="83" REF="92">
Pallet hearing the fir&s;t of the&s;e di&s;hes de&s;cribed,
lifted up his hands and eyes, and with &s;igns of
loathing and amazement pronounced, &startq;A pye
made of dormice and &s;yrup of poppies; Chri&s;t
in heaven! what bea&s;tly fellows the&s;e Romans
were!&endq; His friend checked him for his irre|verent
exclamation with a &s;evere look, and re|commended
the veal, of which he him&s;elf chear|fully
ate, with &s;uch encomiums to the company,
that the baron re&s;olved to imitate his example,
after having called for a bumper of Burgundy,
which the phy&s;ician, for his &s;ake, wi&s;hed to have
been the true wine of Falernum. The painter
&s;eeing nothing el&s;e upon the table which he would
venture to touch, made a merit of nece&s;&s;ity, and
had recour&s;e to the veal al&s;o; although he could
not help &s;aying, that he would not give one &s;lice of
the roa&s;t beef of old England for all the dainties of
a Roman emperor's table. But all the doctor's in|vitations
and a&s;&s;urances could not prevail upon his
gue&s;ts to honour the hachis and the goo&s;e; and
that cour&s;e was &s;ucceeded by another, in which
he told them were divers of tho&s;e di&s;hes, which
among the antients had obtained the appellation
of <HI>politeles,</HI> or magnificent. &startq;That which &s;moaks
in the middle (&s;aid he) is a &s;ow's &s;tomach, filled
with a compo&s;ition of minced pork, hog's brains,
eggs, pepper, cloves, garlick, annifeed, rue, gin|ger,
oil, wine and pickle. On the right hand
&s;ide are the teats and belly of a &s;ow, ju&s;t far|rowed,
fried with &s;weet wine, oil, flour, lovage
and pepper. On the left is a frica&s;&s;ee of &s;nails,
&s;ed, or rather purged with milk. At that end
n$xt Mr. Pallet are fritters of pompions, lovage,
$$iganum and oil; and here are a couple of pul|lets,
<PB N="84" REF="93">
roa&s;ted and &s;tuffed in the manner of Api|cius.</P>
<P>The painter, who had by wry faces, te|&s;tify'd
his abhorrence of the &s;ow's &s;tomach,
which he compared to a bagpipe, and the &s;nails
which had undergone purgation, no &s;ooner heard
him mention the roa&s;ted pullets, than he eagerly
&s;ollicited a wing of the &s;owl; upon which the
doctor de&s;ired he would take the trouble of cut|ting
them up, and accordingly &s;ent them round,
while Mr. Pallet tucked the table-cloth under
his chin, and brandi&s;hed his knife and fork with
&s;ingular addre&s;s: but &s;carce were they &s;et down
before him, when the tears ran down his cheeks,
and he called aloud, in manife&s;t di&s;order, &startq;Z&mdash;ds!
this is the e&s;&s;ence of a whole bed of garlic!&endq;
That he might not, however, di&s;appoint or di&s;|grace
the entertainer, he applied his in&s;truments
to one of the birds, and when he opened up the
cavity, was a&s;&s;aulted by &s;uch an irruption of in|tolerable
&s;mells, that without &s;taying to di&s;en|gage
him&s;elf from the cloth, he &s;prung away,
with an exclamation of, &startq;Lord Je&s;us!&endq; and
involved the whole table in havock, ruin and
confu&s;ion.</P>
<P>Before Pickle could accompli&s;h his e&s;cape, he
was &s;auced with the &s;yrup of the dormou&s;e pye,
which went to pieces in the general wreck; and
as f$r the Italian count, he was overwhelmed by
the &s;ow's &s;tomach, which bur&s;ting in the fail,
di&s;charged its contents upon his leg and thigh,
and &s;calded him &s;o mi&s;erably, that he &s;hricked
with angui&s;h, and grinned with a mo&s;t gha&s;tly
and horrible a&s;pect.</P>
<P>The baron, who &s;at &s;ecure without the vortex
of this tumult, was not at all di&s;plea&s;ed at &s;eeing
<PB N="85" REF="94">
his companions involved in &s;uch a calamity as
that which he had already &s;hared; but the doctor
was confounded with &s;hame and vexation. After
having pre&s;cribed an application of oil to the
count's leg, he expre&s;&s;ed his &s;orrow for the mi&s;|adventure,
which he openly a&s;cribed to want
of ta&s;te and prudence in the painter, who did not
think proper to return, and make an apology in
per&s;on; and prote&s;ted, that there was nothing in
the fowls which could give offence to a &s;en&s;ible
no&s;e, the &s;tuffing being a mixture of pepper,
lovage and a&s;&s;a foetida, and the &s;auce con&s;i&s;ting
of wine and herring-pickle, which he had u&s;ed
in&s;tead of the celebrated garum of the Romans;
that famous pickle having been prepared &s;ome|times
of the &s;combri, which were a &s;ort of tunny
fi&s;h, and &s;ometimes of the &s;ilurus, or &s;had-fi&s;h:
nay, he ob&s;erved that there was a third kind,
called garum haemation, made of the g$ts, gills
and blood of the thynnus.</P>
<P>The phy&s;ician, finding it would be impracti|cable
to re-e&s;tabli&s;h the order of the banquet, by
pre&s;enting again the di&s;hes which had been di&s;|compo&s;ed,
ordered every thing to be removed, a
clean cloth to be laid, and the de&s;ert to be
brought in.</P>
<P>Mean while, he regretted his incapacity to
give them a &s;pecimen of the alieus, or fi&s;h meals
of the ancients, &s;uch as the jus diabaton, the
conger-eel, which in Galen's opinion is hard of
dig$$tion, the cornuta, or gurnard, de&s;cribed by
Pliny in his Natural Hi&s;tory, who &s;ays, the horns
of many of them were a foot and a half in
length; the mullet and lamprey, that were in
the highe&s;t e&s;timation of old, of which la&s;t Julius
Cae&s;ar borrowed &s;ix thou&s;and for one triumphal
<PB N="86" REF="95">
&s;upper. He ob&s;erved, that the manner of dre&s;|&s;ing
them was de&s;cribed by Horace, in the ac|count
he gives of the entertainment to which
Maecenas was invited by the epicure Na&s;iede|nus:
<Q>Affertur &s;quillas inter Murena natantes, &amp;c.</Q></P>
<P>And told them, that they were commonly eaten
with the rhus &s;yriacum, a certain anodyne and
a&s;tringent &s;eed, which qualified the purgative na|ture
of the fi&s;h. Finally, this learned phy&s;ician
gave them to under&s;tand, that though this was
reckoned a luxurious di&s;h in the zenith of the
Roman ta&s;te, it was by no means comparable, in
point of expence, to &s;ome preparations in vogue
about the time of that ab&s;urd voluptuary Helio|gabalus,
who ordered the brains of &s;ix hundred
o&s;triches to be compounded in one me&s;s.</P>
<P>By this time the de&s;ert appeared, and the com|pany
were not a little rejoiced to &s;ee plain olives
in &s;alt and water: but what the ma&s;ter of the
fea&s;t valued him&s;elf upon, was a &s;ort of jelly,
which he affirmed to be preferable to the hypo|trimma
of He&s;ychius, being a mixture of vine|gar,
pickle and honey, boiled to a proper con|&s;i&s;tence,
and candied a&s;&s;a foetida, which he a&s;|&s;erted,
in contradiction to Humelbergius and
Li&s;ter, was no other than the la&s;er &s;yriacum, &s;o
precious, as to be &s;old among the ancients to the
weight of a &s;ilver penny. The gentlemen took
his word for the excellency of this gum, but con|tented
them&s;elves with the olives, which gave
&s;uch an agreeable reli&s;h to the wine, that they
&s;eemed very well di&s;po&s;ed to con&s;ole them&s;elves
for the di&s;graces they had endured; and Pickle,
<PB N="87" REF="96">
unwilling to lo&s;e the lea&s;t circum&s;tance of enter|tainment
that could be enjoyed in their company,
went in que&s;t of the painter, who remained in
his penitentials in another apartment, and could
not be per&s;uaded to re-enter the banqueting|room,
until Peregrine undertook to procure his
pardon from tho&s;e whom he had injured. Having
a&s;&s;ured him of this indulgence, our young gen|tleman
led him in like a criminal, bowing on
all hands with an air of humility and contrition;
and particularly addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to the count,
to whom he &s;wore in Engli&s;h, as God was his
&s;aviour, he had no intent to affront man, wo|man,
or child; but was fain to make the be&s;t
of his way, that he might not give the honour|able
company cau&s;e of offence, by obeying the
dictates of nature in their pre&s;ence.</P>
<P>When Pickle interpreted this apology to the
Italian, Pallet was forgiven in very polite terms,
and even received into favour by his friend the
doctor, in con&s;equence of our hero's interce&s;&s;ion:
&s;o that all the gue&s;ts forgot their chagrin, and
paid their re&s;pects &s;o piou&s;ly to the bottle, that
in a &s;hort time the Champaigne produced very
evident effects in the behaviour of all pre&s;ent.</P>
</DIV2>

<PB N="88" REF="97">
<HEAD>CHAP. XLIX.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">The Italian marquis and German baron are di&s;|graced;
the painter is per&s;uaded to accompany
Pickle to a ma&s;querade in woman's apparel; is
engaged in a trouble&s;ome adventure, and with
his companion conveyed to the Ba&s;tile.</HEAD>
<P>THE painter, at the reque&s;t of Pickle, who
had a de&s;ign upon the count's &s;en&s;e of
hearing, favoured the company with the &s;ong of
<HI>Bumper Squire Jones,</HI> which yielded infinite &s;ati&s;|faction
to the baron; but affected the delicate
ears of the Italian in &s;uch a manner, that his
features expre&s;&s;ed a&s;toni&s;hment and di&s;quiet; and
by his &s;udden and repeated journeys to the door,
it plainly appeared, that he was in the &s;ame pre|dicament
with tho&s;e who, as Shake&s;pear ob&s;erves,
when the bagpipe &s;ings in the no&s;e, cannot con|tain
their urine for affection.</P>
<P>With a view, therefore, of vindicating mu&s;ic
from &s;uch a barbarous ta&s;te, Mr. Pallet had no
&s;ooner performed his ta&s;k, than the count ho|noured
his friends with &s;ome favourite airs of his
own country, which he warbled with infinite
grace and expre&s;&s;ion, though they h$d not energy
&s;ufficient to engage the attention of the German,
who fell fa&s;t a&s;leep upon his couch, and &s;nored &s;o
loud, as to interrupt, and totally annul this ra|vi&s;hing
entertainment; &s;o that they were fain to
have recour&s;e again to the gl$&s;s, which made
&s;uch innovation upon the brain of the phy&s;ician,
that he &s;ung divers odes of Anacreon to a tune
of his own compo&s;ing, and held forth upon the
mu&s;ic and recitative of the ancients with great
<PB N="89" REF="98">
erudition; while Pallet, having found means to
make the Italian acquainted with the nature of
his profe&s;&s;ion, harangued upon painting with
wonderful volubility, in a language which (it was
well for his own credit) the &s;tranger did not un|der&s;tand.</P>
<P>At length the doctor was &s;eized with &s;uch a
qualm, that he begged Peregrine to lead him to
his chamber; and the count, tired with the
e $ ernal babble of the painter, reeled towards the
&s;leeping baron, whom he viewed with rapture,
repeating from the <HI>Il Pa&s;tor Fido</HI> of Guarini,</P>
<Q><L>Come a&s;&s;$tato infermo</L>
<L>Che bram&ograve; lungament&eacute;</L>
<L>Il vietato licor&mdash;</L>
<L>&mdash;Tal' Io! gran tempo infermo,</L>
<L>E d'amoro&s;a &s;ete ar&s;o, e con&s;unto.</L></Q>
<P>Then boldly ravi&s;hed a ki&s;s, and began to tickle
him under the ribs, with &s;uch expre&s;&s;ions of ten|derne&s;s,
as &s;candalized the virtuous painter, who,
con&s;cious of his own attractions, was alarmed
for his per&s;on, and &s;taggered in great hurry and
di&s;compo&s;ure into the next room, where he put
him&s;elf under the protection of our hero, to
whom he imparted his &s;u&s;picion of the count's
morals, by de&s;cribing the indecency of his de|portment.</P>
<P>Peregrine, who entertained a ju&s;t dete&s;tation
for all &s;uch abominable practices, was incen&s;ed at
this information; and &s;tepping to the door of the
dining room where the two &s;trangers were left
together, &s;aw with his own eyes enough to con|vince
him, that Pallet's complaint was not with|out
foundation, and that the baron was not aver&s;e
<PB N="90" REF="99">
to the addre&s;&s;es of the count. Our young gen|tleman's
indignation had well nigh prompted him
to ru&s;h in, and take immediate vengeance on the
offenders; but, con&s;idering that &s;uch a precipi|tate
&s;tep might be attended with trouble&s;ome
con&s;equences to him&s;elf, he re&s;i&s;ted the impul&s;e
of his wrath, and ta&s;ked his invention with &s;ome
method of inflicting upon them a di&s;grace &s;uited
to the gro&s;&s;ne&s;s of their ideas. After having re|volved
&s;undry &s;chemes of puni&s;hment, and even
con&s;ulted Mr. Pipes, who being pre&s;ent at the
di&s;covery, undertook to few them up in bags,
with a rea&s;onable quantity of balla&s;t in each, and
throw them over the Pont Neuf into the river;
his imagination could not &s;upply him with an ex|pedient
to his liking, and he was at a lo&s;s how
to behave, when the landlady of the hou&s;e, whom
he knew to be a dame of remarkable vivacity,
chancing to pa&s;s, furni&s;hed him with a hint, of
which he immediately took the advantage, by
begging &s;he would do him the favour to &s;tep into
the next room, and tell the gentlemen, that he
would be with them as &s;oon as the doctor could
be put to bed.</P>
<P>The lady very graciou&s;ly undertook the office,
and entering the apartment, was &s;o much of|fended
and enraged at the mutual endearments of
the two lovers, that in&s;tead of delivering the
me&s;&s;age with which &s;he had been entru&s;ted, &s;he
&s;et the trumpet of reproach to her mouth, and
&s;eizing the baron's cane, which &s;he found upon
the &s;ide table, belaboured them both with &s;uch
eagerne&s;s of animo&s;ity, that they found them|&s;elves
obliged to make a very di&s;orderly retreat,
and were actually driven down &s;tairs, in a mo&s;t
di&s;graceful condition, by this exa&s;perated virago,
<PB N="91" REF="100">
who loaded them with ju&s;t invectives all the way,
publi&s;hing their &s;hame, not only to tho&s;e of her
own family, but likewi&s;e to the populace, who
began to crowd about the door, and in all pro|bability
would have e&s;pou&s;ed her revenge, had not
their lacqueys, who were in waiting, conveyed
the delinquents into the Remi&s;e, and carried them
off with great expedition.</P>
<P>Peregrine was &s;o delighted with the manner of
the cha&s;ti&s;ement they had undergone, that he
embraced the mi&s;tre&s;s of the hotel with tran&s;port,
for the &s;pirit &s;he had exerted; and being rendered
frolick&s;ome with the wine he had drank, pro|po&s;ed
that he and Pallet &s;hould go to a ma&s;querade,
which he recollected was to be given that night.
The painter did not want curio&s;ity and inclina|tion
to accompany him, but expre&s;&s;ed his appre|hen&s;ion
of lo&s;ing him in the ball; an accident
which could not fail to be very di&s;agreeable, as
he was an utter &s;tranger to the language and the
town. To obviate this objection, the landlady,
who was of their council, advi&s;ed him to appear
in a woman's dre&s;s, which would lay his com|panion
under the nece&s;&s;ity of attending him with
more care, as he could not with decency detach
him&s;elf from the lady whom he &s;hould intro|duce:
be&s;ides, &s;uch a &s;uppo&s;ed connexion would
hinder the ladies of plea&s;ure from acco&s;ting, and
employing their &s;educing arts upon a per&s;on al|ready
engaged.</P>
<P>Our young gentleman, fore&s;eeing abundance
of diver&s;ion in the execution of this project, &s;e|conded
the propo&s;al with &s;uch importunity and
addre&s;s, that the painter allowed him&s;elf to be
habited in a &s;uit belonging to the landlady, who
al&s;o procured for him a ma&s;k and domino, while
<PB N="92" REF="101">
Pickle provided him&s;elf with a Spani&s;h dre&s;s. In
this di&s;gui&s;e, which they put on about eleven
o'clock, did they, attended by Pipes, &s;et out in
a Fiacre for the ball-room, into which Pickle led
this &s;uppo&s;ititious female, to the a&s;toni&s;hment of
the whole company, who had never &s;een &s;uch an
uncouth figure in the appearance of a woman.</P>
<P>After they had taken a view of all the re|markable
ma&s;ques, and the painter had been
treated with a gla&s;s of liqueur, his mi&s;chievous
companion gave him the &s;lip, and vani&s;hing in
an in&s;tant, returned with another ma&s;k and a do|mino
over his habit, that he might enjoy Pallet's
perplexity, and be at hand to protect him from
in&s;ult.</P>
<P>The poor painter having lo&s;t his guide, was
almo&s;t di&s;tracted with anxiety, and &s;talked about
the room, in que&s;t of him, with &s;uch huge &s;trides
and oddity of ge&s;ture, that he was followed by
a whole multitude, who gazed at him as a pre|ternatural
phaenomenon. This attendance in|crea&s;ed
his unea&s;inefs to &s;uch a degree, that he
could not help uttering a &s;oliloquy aloud, in
which he cur&s;ed his fate for having depended up|on
the promi&s;e of &s;uch a wag; and &s;wore, that
if once he was clear or this &s;crape, he would
not bring him&s;elf into &s;uch a premunire again
for the whole kingdom of France.</P>
<P>Divers petit maitres under&s;tanding the ma&s;que
was a foreigner, who in all probability could not
&s;peak French, made up to him in their turns, in
order to di&s;play their wit and addre&s;s, and teized
him with &s;everal arch que&s;tions; to which he
made no other an&s;wer than, &startq;No <HI>parly Francy.</HI>
Damn your chattering! Go about your bu&s;ine&s;s,
can't ye?&endq; But, what mo&s;t of all contributed
<PB N="93" REF="102">
to his torture and mortification, was a pre&s;&s;ing
call from nature, in con&s;equence of the Cham|paign
he had &s;o liberally &s;wallowed in the after|noon.
In the character of a woman, he neither
knew whither to retire, nor, had he known,
dur&s;t he run the ri&s;k of being di&s;covered, in &s;uch a
&s;ituation, by the individuals of that &s;ex; and if
he &s;hould u&s;e the privilege of a man, in his pre|&s;ent
appearance, he fore&s;aw that he mu&s;t &s;ubject
him&s;elf to the ridicule of the whole company;
&s;o that he was obliged to &s;uffer the mo&s;t racking
pangs of retention, and cour&s;ed round and round
the whole place, ca&s;ting many a woeful look
among the crowd in &s;earch of Pickle, again&s;t
whom he uttered innumerable execrations. At
length, however, he was compelled to yield to
the urgent dictates of nece&s;&s;ity, and following &s;e|veral
gentlemen into a &s;mall adjoining room fur|ni&s;hed
for the occa&s;ion, di&s;charged the &s;ource of
his vexation in pre&s;ence of them all, crying in
his own excu&s;e, &startq;By your leave, by your leave.
Egad! nece&s;&s;ity has no law.&endq; The circum|&s;tances
of this operation were &s;o extraordinary
and ridiculous, that &s;ome of tho&s;e who were wit|ne&s;&s;es
of it, held up their hands in token of
amazement; while others ran into the ball|room,
and called their companions to &s;ee &s;uch
an unheard-of &s;pectacle.</P>
<P>Among the ma&s;ques that, upon this intima|tion,
came to &s;ee the painter's attitude, was a
per&s;on of great quality, who being a little ac|quainted
with the Engli&s;h language, waited till
Pallet turned about; and going up to him,
&startq;Madam, (&s;aid he) I give you joy of your
happy pi&s;&s;e. It me &s;eem, dat your vatere com
$idout grand pain.&endq; &startq;Yes, thank God, Mon|&s;ieur,
<PB N="94" REF="103">
(replied the painter) I never was troubled
with the &s;tone.&endq; &startq;Oho! (re&s;umed the ma&s;que)
&s;o much de bettre. You love to ave de &s;tone
vidout trouble, if I not mi&s;take.&endq; &startq;Gad|zooks!
my dear, you have nicked it to an hair!
That is the very ca&s;e, as I hope to be &s;aved,&endq;
cried Pallet, bur&s;ting into a violent fit of laugh|ter;
which dive&s;ting the Frenchman of all cere|mony
and re&s;erve, he began to be very free with
the &s;uppo&s;ed lady, and attempted to plunge his
hand into her bo&s;om: but the painter was too
mode&s;t to &s;uffer &s;uch indecent treatment; and
when the gallant repeated his efforts in a manner
&s;till more indelicate, lent him &s;uch a box on the
ear, as made the lights dance before him, and
created &s;uch a &s;u&s;picion of Pallet's &s;ex, that the
nobleman &s;wore he was either a male or her|maphrodite,
and in&s;i&s;ted upon a &s;crutiny, for the
&s;ake of his own honour, with &s;uch ob&s;tinacy of
re&s;entment, that the fictitious nymph was in im|minent
danger, not only of being expo&s;ed, but
al&s;o of undergoing &s;evere cha&s;ti&s;ement, for having
made &s;o free with the prince's ear; when Pere|grine,
who &s;aw and over-heard every thing that
pa&s;&s;ed, thought it was high time to interpo&s;e;
and accordingly, a&s;&s;erted his preten&s;ions to the
in&s;ulted lady, who was overjoyed at this proof
of his protection.</P>
<P>The affronted gallant per&s;evered in demanding
to know who &s;he was, and our hero as &s;trenuou&s;ly
refu&s;ed to give him that &s;atisfaction: &s;o that high
words en&s;ued; and the prince threatening to pu|ni&s;h
his in&s;olence, the young gentleman, who
was not &s;uppo&s;ed to know his quality, pointed
to the place where his own &s;word u&s;ed to hang,
and &s;napping his fingers in his face, laid hold on
<PB N="95" REF="104">
the painter's arm, and led him to another part of
the room, leaving his antagoni&s;t to the medita|tions
of his own revenge.</P>
<P>Pallet having chid his conductor for his bar|barous
de&s;ertion, made him acquainted with the
difficulty in which he had been involved, and
flatly telling him, he would not put it in his
power to give him the &s;lip again, held fa&s;t by his
arm during the remaining part of the entertain|ment,
to the no &s;mall diver&s;ion of the company,
who&s;e attention was altogether engro&s;&s;ed in the
contemplation of &s;uch an aukward, ungainly
&s;talking apparition. At la&s;t, Pickle being tired
of exhibiting this raree&s;hew, complied with the
repeated de&s;ires of his companion, and handed
her into the coach; which he him&s;elf had no
&s;ooner entered, than they were &s;urrounded by a
file of mu&s;queteers, commanded by an exempt,
who ordering the coach-door to be opened, took
his place with great deliberation, while one of his
detachment mounted the box, in order to direct
the driver.</P>
<P>Peregrine at once conceived the meaning of
this arre&s;t, and it was well for him that he had no
weapon wherewith to &s;tand upon his defence;
for &s;uch was the impetuo&s;ity and ra&s;hne&s;s of his
temper, that had he been armed, he would have
run all ri&s;ks rather than &s;urrender him&s;elf to any
odds whatever; but Pallet imagining that the of|ficer
was &s;ome gentleman who had mi&s;taken their
carriage for his own, de&s;ired his friend to unde|ceive
the &s;tranger; and when he was informed of
the real &s;tate of their condition, his knees began
to &s;hake, his teeth to chatter, and he uttered a
mo&s;t doleful lamentation, importing his fear of
being carried to &s;ome hideous dungeon of the Ba|&s;tile,
<PB N="96" REF="105">
where he &s;hould &s;pend the re&s;t of his days
in mi&s;ery and horror, and never &s;ee the light of
God's &s;un, nor the face of a friend; but peri&s;h
in a foreign land, far removed from his family and
connexions. Pickle damned him for his pu&s;ila|nimity,
and the Exempt hearing a lady bemoan
her&s;elf &s;o piteou&s;ly, expre&s;&s;ed his mortification at
being the in&s;trument of giving her &s;uch pain, and
endeavoured to con&s;ole them, by repre&s;enting the
lenity of the French government, and the &s;ingular
genero&s;ity of the prince, by who&s;e order they
were apprehended.</P>
<P>Peregrine, who&s;e di&s;cretion &s;eemed to for&s;ake
him on all &s;uch occa&s;ions, exclaimed with great
bitterne&s;s again&s;t the arbitrary admini&s;tration of
France, and inveighed with many expre&s;&s;ions of
contempt, again&s;t the character of the offended
prince, who&s;e re&s;entment, far from being noble,
he &s;aid, was pitiful, ungenerous and unju&s;t. To
this remon&s;trance the officer made no reply, but
&s;hrugged up his &s;houlders in &s;ilent a&s;toni&s;hment at
the <HI>hardie&s;&s;e</HI> of the pri&s;oner, and the Fiacre was
ju&s;t on the point of &s;etting out, when they heard
the noi&s;e of a &s;cuffle at the back of the coach,
and the voice of Tom Pipes, pronouncing &startq;I'll
be damn'd if I do.&endq; This tru&s;ty attendant had
been de&s;ired by one of the guard to de&s;cend from
his &s;tation in the rear, but as he re&s;olved to &s;hare
his ma&s;ter's fate, he took no notice of their in|treaties,
until they were &s;econded by force; and
that he endeavoured to repel with his heel, which
he applied with &s;uch energy to the jaws of the
&s;oldier who fir&s;t came in contact with him, that
they emitted a cra&s;hing &s;ound like a dried walnut
between the grinders of a templar in the pit. Ex|a&s;perated
at this outrage, the other &s;aluted Tom's
<PB N="97" REF="106">
po&s;teriors with his bayonet, which incommoded
him &s;o much, that he could no longer keep his
po&s;t, but leaping upon the ground, gave his an|tagoni&s;t
a chuck under the chin, that laid him
upon his back, and then &s;kipping over him with
infinite agility, ab&s;conded among the crowd of
coaches, till he &s;aw the guard mount before and
behind upon his ma&s;ter's Fiacre, which no &s;ooner
&s;et forward than he followed at a &s;mall di&s;tance,
to reconnoitre the place where Peregrine &s;hould
be confined.</P>
<P>After having proceeded &s;lowly through many
windings and turnings to a part of Paris, in which
Pipes was an utter &s;tranger, the coach &s;topped at
a great gate, with a wicket in the middle, which
being opened at the approach of the carriage, the
pri&s;oners were admitted, and the guard returning
with the Fiacre, Tom determined to watch in
that place all night, that in the morning he might
make &s;uch ob&s;ervations, as might be conducive to
the enlargement of his ma&s;ter.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">By the fidelity of Pipes, Jolter is informed of his
pupil's fate. Confers with the phy&s;ician. Applies
to the Emba&s;&s;ador, who with great difficulty ob|tains
the di&s;charge of the pri&s;oners, on certain con|ditions.</HEAD>
<P>THIS plan he executed notwith&s;tanding the
pain of his wound, and the que&s;tions of
the city guard both hor&s;e and foot, to which he
could make no other an&s;wer than <HI>&startq;Anglois, An|glois;&endq;</HI>
and as &s;oon as it was light, taking an ac|curate
&s;urvey of the ca&s;tle (for &s;uch it &s;eemed to
<PB N="98" REF="107">
be) into which Peregrine and Pallet had been con|veyed,
together with its &s;ituation in re&s;pect to the
river, he went home to the lodgings, and waking
Mr. Jolter, gave him an account of the adven|ture.
The governor wrung his hands in the ut|mo&s;t
grief and con&s;ternation, when he heard this
unfortunate piece of news; he did not doubt that
his pupil was impri&s;oned in the Ba&s;tile for life;
and in the angui&s;h of his apprehen&s;ion, cur&s;ed the
day on which he had undertaken to &s;uperintend
the conduct of &s;uch an imprudent young man,
who had by reiterated in&s;ults provoked the ven|geance
of &s;uch a mild forbearing admini&s;tration.
That he might not, however, neglect any means
in his power to extricate him from his pre&s;ent mi&s;|fortune,
he di&s;patched Thomas to the doctor,
with an account of his companion's fate, that
they might join their intere&s;t in behalf of the
captives; and the phy&s;ician being informed of
what had happened, immediately dre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf
and repaired to Jolter, whom he acco&s;ted in the&s;e
words: &startq;Now, &s;ir, I hope you are convinced
of your error, in a&s;&s;erting that oppre&s;&s;ion can ne|ver
be the effect of arbitrary power. Such a ca|lamity
as this could never have happened under
the Athenian democracy: nay, even when the
tyrant Pi&s;i&s;tratus got po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of that common|wealth,
he dur&s;t not venture to rule with &s;uch
ab&s;olute and unju&s;t dominion. You &s;hall &s;ee now
that Mr. Pickle and my friend Pallet will fall a
&s;acrifice to the tyrancy of lawle&s;s power; and in
my opinion, we &s;hall be acce&s;&s;ory to the ruin of
this poor en&s;laved people, if we be&s;tir our&s;elves
in demanding, or imploring the relea&s;e of our un|happy
countrymen; as we may thereby prevent
the commi&s;&s;ion of a flagrant crime, which would
<PB N="99" REF="108">
fill up the vengeance of heaven again&s;t the perpe|trators,
and perhaps be the means of re&s;toring a
whole nation to the un&s;peakable fruition of free|dom.
For my own part, I &s;hould rejoice to &s;ee
the blood of my father &s;pilt in &s;uch a glorious
cau&s;e, provided &s;uch a victim would furni&s;h me
with the opportunity of di&s;&s;olving the chains of
&s;lavery, and vindicating that liberty which is the
birth-right of man. Then would my name be
immortalized among the patriot heroes of anti|quity,
and my memory like that of Harmodius
and Ari&s;togiton, be honoured by &s;tatues erected
at the public expence.&endq; This rhap&s;ody, which
was delivered with great empha&s;is and agitation,
gave &s;o much offence to Jolter, that without
&s;peaking one word, he retired in great wrath to
his own chamber, and the republican returned to
his lodging, in full hope of his progno&s;tic being
verified in the death and de&s;truction of Peregrine
and the painter, which mu&s;t give ri&s;e to &s;ome re|nowned
revolution, wherein he him&s;elf would act
a principal part. But the governor, who&s;e imagi|nation
was not quite &s;o warm and prolifick, went
directly to the Emba&s;&s;ador, whom he informed of
his pupil's &s;ituation, and be&s;ought to interpo&s;e
with the French mini&s;try, that he and the other
Briti&s;h &s;ubject might obtain their liberty.</P>
<P>His excellency a&s;ked if Jolter could gue&s;s at the
cau&s;e of his impri&s;onment, that he might be the
better prepared to vindicate or excu&s;e his conduct;
but neither he nor Pipes could give the &s;malle&s;t
hint of intelligence on that &s;ubject; though he
furni&s;hed him&s;elf from Tom's own mouth with a
circum&s;tantial account of the manner in which
his ma&s;ter had been arre&s;ted, as well as of his own
behaviour, and the di&s;a&s;ter he had received on that
<PB N="100" REF="109">
occa&s;ion. His Lord&s;hip never doubted that Pickle
had brought this calamity upon him&s;elf by &s;ome
unlucky prank he had played at the ma&s;querade;
e&s;pecially when he under&s;tood that the young
gentleman had drank freely in the afternoon, and
been &s;o whim&s;ical as to go thither with a man in
woman's apparel; and he that &s;ame day waited on
the French mini&s;ter, in full confidence of obtain|ing
his di&s;charge; but met with more difficulty
than he expected, the court of France being ex|tremely
punctilious in every thing that concerns
a prince of the blood: the amba&s;&s;ador was, there|fore,
obliged to talk in very high terms, and
though the pre&s;ent circum&s;tances of the French
politicks would not allow them to fall out with
the Briti&s;h admini&s;tration for trifles, all the favour
he could procure, was a promi&s;e that Pickle
&s;hould be &s;et at liberty, provided he would a&s;k
pardon of the prince to whom he had given offence.
His excellency thought this was but a rea&s;onable
conde&s;cen&s;ion, &s;uppo&s;ing Peregrine to have been
in the wrong; and Jolter was admitted to him,
in order to communicate and reinforce his Lord|&s;hip's
advice, which was that he &s;hould comply
with the terms propo&s;ed. The governor, who did
not enter this gloomy fortre&s;s without fear and
trembling, found his pupil in a di&s;mal apartment
void of all furniture, but a &s;tool and truckle-bed;
the moment he was admitted, he perceived the
youth whi&s;tling with great unconcern, and work|ing
with his pencil at the bare wall, on which he
had delineated a ludicrous figure labelled with the
name of the nobleman whom he had affronted,
and an Engli&s;h ma&s;tiff with his leg lifted up, in
the attitude of making water in his &s;hoe. He had
been even &s;o pre&s;umptuous as to explain the de|vice
<PB N="101" REF="110">
with &s;atirical in&s;criptions in the French lan|guage,
which when Jolter peru&s;ed, his hair &s;tood
on end with affright. The very turnkey was
confounded and overawed by the boldne&s;s of his
behaviour, which he had never &s;een matched by
any inhabitant of that place; and actually joined
his friend in per&s;uading him to &s;ubmit to the ea&s;y
demand of the mini&s;ter. But our hero, far from
embracing the coun&s;el of this advocate, handed
him to the door with great ceremony, and di&s;|mi&s;&s;ed
him with a kick on the breech; and to all
the &s;upplications, and even tears of Jolter, made
no other reply, than that he would &s;toop to no
conde&s;cen&s;ion, becau&s;e he had committed no
crime; but would leave his ca&s;e to the cognizance
and exertion of the Briti&s;h court, who&s;e duty it
was to &s;ee ju&s;tice done to its own &s;ubjects: he
de&s;ired, however, that Pallet, who was confined
in another place, might avail him&s;elf of his own
di&s;po&s;ition, which was &s;ufficiently plyable. But
when the governor de&s;ired to &s;ee his fellow-pri|&s;oner,
the turnkey gave him to under&s;tand that he
had received no orders relating to the lady, and
therefore could not admit him into her apart|ment;
though he was complai&s;ant enough to tell
him, that &s;he &s;eemed very much mortified at her
confinement, and at certain times behaved as if
her brain was not a little di&s;ordered. Jolter thus
baffled in all his endeavours, qui$ted the Ba&s;tile
with a heavy heart, and reported his fruitle&s;s ne|gociation
to the Emba&s;&s;ador, who could not help
breaking forth into &s;ome acrimonious expre&s;&s;ions
again&s;t the ob&s;tinacy and in&s;olence of the young
man, who, he &s;aid, de&s;erved to &s;uffer for his
folly. Neverthele&s;s, he did not de&s;i&s;t from his
repre&s;entations to the French mini&s;try, which he
<PB N="102" REF="111">
&s;ound &s;o unyielding, that he was obliged to
threaten in plain terms, to make it a national con|cern;
and not only write to his court for in&s;truc|tions,
but even advi&s;e the council to make re|pri&s;als,
and &s;end &s;ome French gentleman in Lon|don
to the Tower.</P>
<P>This intimation had an effect upon the mini|&s;try
at Ver&s;ailles, who rather than run the ri&s;k of
incen&s;ing a people whom it was neither their in|tere&s;t
nor inclination to di&s;oblige, con&s;ented to
di&s;charge the offenders, on condition that they
&s;hould leave Paris in three days after their enlarge|ment.
This propo&s;al was readily agreed to by
Peregrine, who wa$ now a little more tractable,
and heartily tired of being cooped up in &s;uch an
uncomfortable abode, for the &s;pace of three long
days, without any &s;ort of communication or en|tertainment,
but that which his own imagination
&s;ugge&s;ted.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Peregrine makes him&s;elf merry at the expence of the

<P>AS he could ea&s;ily conceive the &s;ituation of
his companion in adver&s;ity, he was unwil|ling
to leave the place, until he had reaped &s;ome
diver&s;ion from his di&s;tre&s;s, and with that view re|paired
to the dungeon of the afflicted painter, to
which he had by this time free acce&s;s. When he
entered, the fir&s;t object that pre&s;ented it&s;elf to his
eye, was &s;o uncommonly ridiculous, that he could
&s;carce pre&s;erve that gravity of countenance which
he had affected in order to execute the joke he
<PB N="103" REF="112">
had planned. The forlorn Pallet &s;at upright in
his bed in a di&s;habille that was altogether extra|ordinary.
He had laid a&s;ide his mon&s;trous hoop,
together with his &s;tays, gown and petticoat,
wrapped his lappets about his head by way of
night-$ap, and wore his domino as a loo&s;e morn|ing
dre&s;s; his gr$zz$ed locks hung down about
his lack-lu&s;tre eyes and taw$y neck, in all the
di&s;order of negligence; his grey beard bri&s;tled
about half an inch, through the remains of the
paint with which his vi&s;age had been bedaubed,
and every feature of his face was lengthened to
the mo&s;t ridiculous expre&s;&s;ion of grief and di&s;may.
Seeing Peregrine come in, he &s;tarted up in a &s;ort
of frantic exta&s;y, and running toward him with
open arms, no &s;ooner perceived the woeful ap|pearance
into which our hero had mo$elled his
phy&s;iognomy, than he &s;topped &s;hort all of a &s;ud|den,
and the joy which had begun to take p$&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion

the mo&s;t rueful pre&s;ages; &s;o that he &s;tood in a
mo&s;t ludicrous po&s;ture of dejection, like a ma$$|factor
at the Old Baily, when &s;entence is about to
be pronounced. Pickle taking him by the hand,
heaved a profound &s;igh, and after having prote&s;ted
that he was extremely mortified at being pitched
upon as the me&s;&s;enger of bad news, told him
with an air of &s;ympathy and infinite concern,
that the French court having di&s;covered his &s;ex,
had re&s;olved, in con&s;ideration of the outrageous
indignity he offered in public to a prince of the
blood, to detain him in the Ba&s;tile a pri&s;oner for
life; and that this &s;entence was a mi$gation ob|tained
by the importunities of the Briti&s;h Emba&s;|&s;ador;
the puni&s;hment ordained by law being no
other than breaking alive upon the wheel. The&s;e
<PB N="104" REF="113">
tidings aggravated the horrors of the painter to
&s;uch a degree, that he roared aloud, and &s;kipped
about the room, in all the extravagance of di|&s;traction;
taking God and man to witne&s;s that he
would rather &s;uffer immediate death, than endure
one year's impri&s;onment in &s;uch a hideous place;
and cur&s;ing the hour of his birth, and the moment
on which he departed from his own country.
&startq;For my own part, (&s;aid his tormenter in an hy|pocritical
tone) I was obliged to &s;wallow the bit|ter
p$ll of making &s;ubmi&s;&s;ions to the prince, who,
as I had not pre&s;umed to &s;trike him, received ac|knowledgments,
in con&s;equence of which I &s;hall
be this day &s;et at liberty; and there is even one
expedient left for the recovery of your freedom.
It is, I own, a di&s;agreeable remedy, but one had
better undergo a little mortification, than be for
ever wretched. Be&s;ides, upon &s;econd thoughts,
I begin to imagine that you will not for &s;uch a
trifle &s;acrifice your&s;elf to the uncea&s;ing horrors of
a &s;olitary dungeon; e&s;pecially as your conde&s;cen|&s;ion
will in all probability be attended with advan|tages
which you could not otherwi&s;e enjoy.&endq;
Pallet interrupting him with great eagerne&s;s, beg|ged
for the love of God that he would no longer
keep him in the torture of &s;u&s;pence, but mention
that &s;ame remedy, which he was re&s;olved to &s;wal|low,
let it be never &s;o unpalatable.</P>
<P>Peregrine having thus played upon his pa&s;&s;ions of
fear and hope, an&s;wered, that as the offence was
committed in the habit of a woman, which was
a di&s;gui&s;e unworthy of the other &s;ex; the French
court was of opinion that the delinquent &s;hould
for ever forfeit the privileges and characteri&s;tic
of a man, which he had &s;o &s;hamefully depo&s;ited,
or in other words, be deprived of his virility; &s;o
<PB N="105" REF="114">
that there was an alternative at his own option,
by which he had it in his power to regain imme|diate
freedom.&endq; &startq;What! cried the painter in
de&s;pair, part with my manhood, and become a
&s;inger? Gadzooks! and the devil and all that,

not only brought me to this pa&s;s, but al&s;o ren|dered
me abominable to my&s;elf, and frightful to
others; for, when I this morning &s;ignified to
the turnkey, that I wanted to be &s;haved, he
looked at my beard with a&s;toni&s;hment, and cro&s;&s;|ing
him&s;elf, muttered his pater-no&s;ter, believing

<P><PB N="106" REF="115">
Our young gentleman, having heard his la|mentation
to an end, excu&s;ed him&s;elf for his
conduct, by repre&s;enting, that he could not po&s;|&s;ibly
fore&s;ee the di&s;agreeable con&s;equences that
attended it; and in the mean time, &s;trenuou&s;ly
coun&s;elled him to &s;ubmit to the terms of his en|largement.
He ob&s;erved, that he was now ar|rived
at that time of life, when the lu&s;ts of the
fle&s;h &s;hould be entirely mortified within him,
and his greate&s;t concern ought to be the health
of his &s;oul, to which nothing could more effec|tually
contribute than the amputation which was
propo&s;ed: that his body, as well as his mind,
would profit by the change, becau&s;e he would
have no dangerous appetite to gratify, and no
carnal thoughts to divert him from the duties of
his profe&s;&s;ion; and his voice, which was natu|rally
&s;weet, would improve to &s;uch a degree,
that he would captivate the ears of all the people
of fa&s;hion and ta&s;te, and in a little time be cele|brated
under the appellation of the Engli&s;h Se|ne&s;ino.</P>
<P>The&s;e arguments did not fail to make impre&s;|&s;ion
upon the painter, who, neverthele&s;s, &s;tarted
three objections to his compliance; namely, the
di&s;grace of the puni&s;hment, the pain of the ope|ration,
and the dread of his wife. Pickle under|took
to obviate the&s;e difficulties, by a&s;&s;uring him,
that the &s;entence would be executed &s;o privately,
as never to tran&s;pire; that the exci&s;ion (as he
had learnt from Motecelli) was not &s;o painful as
the drawing of a tooth, and that his wife could
not be &s;o uncon&s;cionable, after &s;o many years of
cohabitation, as to take exceptions to an expe|dient,
by which &s;he would not only enjoy the
conver&s;ation of her hu&s;band, but even the fruits
<PB N="107" REF="116">
of tho&s;e talents which the knife would &s;o re|markably
refine.</P>
<P>Pallet &s;hook his head at this la&s;t remon&s;trance,
as if he thought it would not be altogether con|vincing
to his &s;pou&s;e; but yielded to the propo&s;al,
provided her con&s;ent could be obtained. Ju&s;t as
he &s;ignified this conde&s;cen&s;ion, the goaler en|tered,
and addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to the &s;uppo&s;ed lady,
expre&s;&s;ed his &s;atisfaction in having the honour to
tell her, that &s;he was no longer a pri&s;oner. As
the painter did not under&s;tand one word of what
he &s;aid, Peregrine undertook the office of inter|preter,
and made his friend believe, the goaler's
&s;peech was no other than an intimation, that the
mini&s;try had &s;ent a &s;urgeon to execute what was
propo&s;ed, and that the in&s;truments and dre&s;&s;ings
were prepared in the next room. Alarmed and
terrified at this &s;udden appointment, he flew to
the other end of the room, and &s;natching up an
$a$then chamber-pot, which was the only of|fen&s;ive
weapon in the place, put him&s;elf in a
po&s;ture of defiance, and with many oaths threat|ened
to try the temper of the barber's &s;kull, if he
&s;hould pre&s;ume to &s;et his no&s;e within the apart|ment.</P>
<P>The goaler, who little expected &s;uch a recep|tion,
concluded that the poor gentlewoman had
actually lo&s;t her wits, and retreated with precipi|tation,
leaving the door open as he went out.
Upon which Pickle, gathering up the particulars
of his dre&s;s with great di&s;patch, crammed them
into Pailet's arms, and taking notice that now
the coa&s;t was clear, exhorted him to follow his
foot&s;teps to the gate, where a hackney-coach
&s;tood for his reception. There being no time
for he&s;itation, the painter took his advice, and
<PB N="108" REF="117">
without quitting the uten&s;il, which in his hurry
he forgot to lay down, fallied out in the rear of
our hero, with all that wildne&s;s of terror and
impatience which may be rea&s;onably &s;uppo&s;ed to
take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a man who flies from ca&s;tration
or perpetual impri&s;onment. Such was the tumult
of his agitation, that his faculty of thinking was for
the pre&s;ent utterly overwhelmed, and he &s;aw no
object but his conductor, whom he followed by a
&s;ort of in&s;tinctive impul&s;e, without regarding the
keepers and centinels, who, as he pa&s;&s;ed with
his cloaths under one arm, and his chamber-pot
brandi&s;hed above his head, were confounded, and
even di&s;mayed at the &s;trange apparition.</P>
<P>During the whole cour&s;e of this irruption, he
cea&s;ed not to cry with great vociferation, &startq;Drive,
coachman, drive in the name of God!&endq; And the
carriage had proceeded the length of a whole
&s;treet, before he manife&s;ted the lea&s;t &s;ign of re|flection,
but &s;tared like the Gorgon's head, with
his mouth wide open, and each particular hair
crawling and twining like an animated &s;erpent.
At length, however, he began to recover the
u&s;e of his &s;en&s;es, and a&s;ked if Peregrine thought
him now out of all danger of being retaken.
This unrelenting wag, not yet &s;atisfied with the
affliction he had impo&s;ed upon the &s;ufferer, an|&s;wered
with an air of doubt and concern, that
he hoped they would not be overtaken, and
prayed to God they might not be retarded by
an <HI>Embaras.</HI> Pallet &s;ervently joined in this &s;up|plication,
and they advanced a few yards further,
when the noi&s;e of a coach at full &s;peed behind
them, invaded their ears; and Pickle having
looked out at the window, withdrew his head in
&s;eeming confu&s;ion, and exclaimed, &startq;Lord have
<PB N="109" REF="118">
mercy upon us! I wi&s;h that may not be a guard
&s;ent after us. Methinks I &s;aw the muzzle of a
fu&s;il &s;ticking out of the coach.&endq; The pain$er
hearing the&s;e tidings, that in&s;tant thru&s;t him&s;elf
half out at the window, with his helmet &s;till in
his hand, bellowing to the coachman as loud as
he could roar, &startq;Drive, damn ye drive! to the
gates of Jericho and ends of the earth! Drive,
you raggamuffin, you rap&s;callion, you hell-hound!
drive us to the pit of hell, rather than we &s;hould
be taken, and lo&s;e the trea&s;ures of virility.&endq;</P>
<P>Such a phantom could not pa&s;s, without at|tracting
the curio&s;ity of the people, who ran to
their doors and windows, in order to behold this
object of admiration. With the &s;ame view that
coach, which was &s;uppo&s;ed to be in pur&s;uit of
him, &s;topt ju&s;t as the windows of each happened
to be oppo&s;ite; and Pallet looking behind, and
&s;eeing three men &s;tanding upon the foot-board
armed with canes, which his fear converted into
fu&s;ils, never doubted that his friend's &s;u&s;picion
was ju&s;t; but, &s;haking his jordan at the imagi|nary
guard, &s;wore he would &s;ooner die than part
with his precious ware. The owner of the
coach, who was a nobleman of the fir&s;t quality,
mi&s;took him for &s;ome unhappy woman deprived
of her &s;en&s;es; and ordering his coachman to
proceed, convinced the fugitive, to his infinite
joy, that this was no more than a fal&s;e alarm.
He was not, for all that, freed from anxiety and
trepidation; but our young gentleman, fearing
his brain would not bear a repetition of the &s;ame
joke, permitted him to gain his own lodgings,
without further mole&s;tation.</P>
<P>His landlady meeting him on the &s;tair, was &s;o
affected at his appearance, that &s;he &s;creamed
<PB N="110" REF="119">
aloud, and betook her&s;elf to flight; while he,
cur&s;ing her with great bitterne&s;s, ru&s;hed into the
apartment of the doctor, who, in&s;tead of re|ceiving
him with cordial embraces, and congra|tulating
him upon his deliverance, gave evident
tokens of umbrage and di&s;content; and even
plainly told him, he hoped to have heard that he
and Mr. Pickle had acted the glorious part of
Cato; an event which would have laid the foun|dation
of &s;uch noble &s;truggles, as could not fail
to end in happine&s;s and freedom; and that he
had already made &s;ome progre&s;s in an ode that
would have immortalized their names, and in|&s;pired
the flame of liberty in every hone&s;t brea&s;t.
&startq;There (&s;aid he) I would have proved, that
great talents, and high &s;entiments of liberty, do
reciprocally produce and a&s;&s;i&s;t each other; and il|lu&s;trated
my a&s;&s;ertions with &s;uch notes and quo|tations
from the Greek writers, as would have
opened the eye, of the m$&s;t blind and unthink|ing,
and touched the mo&s;t callous and obdurate
heart. <HI>O fool! to think the man, who&s;e ample
mind mu&s;t gra&s;p whatever yonder &s;tars &s;urvey</HI>&mdash;
Prav, Mr. Pallet, what is your opinion of that
image of the mind's gra&s;ping the whole univer&s;e?
For my own part, I can't help thinking it the
mo&s;t happy conception that ever entered my ima|gination.</P>
<P>The painter, who was not &s;uch a flaming en|thu&s;ia&s;t
in the cau&s;e of liberty, could not brook
the doctor's refle$$on, which he thought fa|voured
a little too much of indifference and de|ficiency
in point of private friend&s;hip; and there|for$
&s;eized the pre&s;ent opportunity of mortifying
his p$ide by ob&s;erving, that the image was,
without all doubt, very grand and magnificent;
<PB N="111" REF="120">
but that he had been obliged for the idea to Mr.
Bayes in <HI>The Rehear&s;al,</HI> who values him&s;elf upon
the &s;ame figure, conveyed in the&s;e words, <HI>But
all the&s;e clouds, when by the eye of rea&s;on gra&s;p'd,
&amp;c.</HI> Upon any other occa&s;ion, the painter
would have triumphed greatly in this detection;
but &s;uch was the flutter and confu&s;ion of his &s;pi|rits,
under the apprehen&s;ion of being retaken,
that without further communication, he retreated
to his own room, in order to re&s;ume his own
dre&s;s, which he hoped would alter his appearance
in &s;uch a manner, as to baffle all &s;earch and exa|mination;
while the phy&s;ician remained a&s;hamed
and aba&s;hed, to find him&s;elf convicted of pla|giari&s;m
by a per&s;on of &s;uch contemptible talents.
He was offended at this proof of his memory,
and &s;o much enraged at his pre&s;umption in ex|hibiting
it, that he could never forgive his want
of reverence, and took every opportunity of ex|po&s;ing
his ignorance and folly in the &s;equel. In|deed,
the ties of private affection were too weak
to engage the heart of this republican, who&s;e
zeal for the community had entirely &s;wallowed
up his concern for individuals. He looked upon
particular friend&s;hip as a pa&s;&s;ion unworthy of his
ample &s;oul, and was a profe&s;&s;ed admirer of L.
Manlius, Junius Brutus, and tho&s;e later patriots
of the &s;ame name, who &s;hut their cars again&s;t
the cries of nature, and re&s;i&s;ted all the dictates of
gratitude and humanity.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. LII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Pallet conceives an hearty contempt for his fellow-traveller,
and attaches him&s;elf to Pickle, who,
neverthele&s;s, per&s;ecutes him with his mi&s;chievous
talent, upon the road to Flanders.</HEAD>
<P>IN the mean time, his companion having em|ployed
divers pails full of water, in clearing
him&s;elf from the &s;qualor of a jail, &s;ubmitted his
face to the barber, tinged his eye-brows with a
&s;able hue, and being dre&s;&s;ed in his own cloaths,
ventured to vi&s;it Peregrine, who was &s;till under
the hands of his valet de chambre, and who gave
him to under&s;tand, that his e&s;cape had been con|nived
at, and that the condition of their deli|verance
was their departure from Paris in three
days.</P>
<P>The painter was tran&s;ported with joy, when
he learnt that he ran no ri&s;que of being retaken;
and far from repining at the terms of his en|largement,
would have willingly &s;et out on his
return to England that &s;ame afternoon; for the
Ba&s;tile had made &s;uch an impre&s;&s;ion upon him,
that he &s;tarted at the &s;ound of every coach, and
turned pale at &s;ight of a French &s;oldier. In the
fullne&s;s of his heart, he comp$ained of the doc|tor's
indifference, and related what had pa&s;&s;ed at
their meeting with evident marks of re&s;entment
and di&s;re&s;pect; which were not at all dimini&s;hed,
when Jolter informed him of the phy&s;ician's be|haviour,
when he &s;ent for him, to confer about
the means of abridging their confinement. Pickle
him&s;elf was incen&s;ed at his want of bowels, and
perceiving how much he had &s;unk in the opinion
<PB N="113" REF="122">
of his fellow-traveller, re&s;olved to encourage
the&s;e &s;entiments of di&s;gu&s;t, and occa&s;ionally fo|ment
the divi&s;ion to a downright quarrel, which
he fore&s;aw would produce &s;ome diver&s;ion, and
perhaps expo&s;e the poet's character in &s;uch a
light, as would effectually puni&s;h him for his ar|r$gance
and barbarity. With this view, he le|velled
&s;everal &s;atirical jokes at the doctor's pe|dantry
and want of ta&s;te, which had appeared &s;o
con&s;picuous in the quotations he had got by heart,
from ancient authors, in his affected di&s;dain of
the be&s;t pictures in the world; which, had he
been endowed with the lea&s;t &s;hare of di&s;cernment,
he could not have beheld with &s;uch in&s;en&s;ibility;
and la&s;tly, in his ridiculous banquet, which none
but an egregious coxcomb, devoid of all elegance
and &s;en&s;e, would have prepared, or pre&s;ented to
rational beings. In a word, our young gentle|man
played the artillery of his wit again&s;t him
with &s;uch &s;ucce&s;s, that the painter &s;eemed to
wake from a dream, and went home with the
mo&s;t hearty contempt for the per&s;on he had for|merly
adored.</P>
<P>In&s;tead of u&s;ing the privilege of a friend, to
enter his apartment without ceremony, he &s;ent
in his &s;ervant with a me&s;&s;age, importing, that he
intended to &s;et out from Paris next day, in com|pany
with Mr. Pickle, and de&s;iring to know
whether or not he was, or would be prepared
for the journey. The doctor, &s;truck with the
manner as well as the matter of this intimation,
went immediately to Pallet's room, and de|manded
to know the cau&s;e of &s;uch a &s;udden de|termination,
without his privity or concurrence;
and when he under&s;tood the nece&s;&s;ity of their af|fairs,
rather than travel by him&s;elf, he ordered
<PB N="114" REF="123">
his baggage to be packed up, and &s;ignified his
readine&s;s to conform to the emergency of the
ca&s;e; though he was not at all plea&s;ed with the
cavalier behaviour of Pallet, to whom he threw
out &s;ome hints of his own importance, and the
immen&s;ity of his conde&s;cen&s;ion, in favouring him
with &s;uch marks of regard. But by this time
the&s;e in&s;inuations had lo&s;t their effect upon the
painter, who told him with an arch &s;neer, that
he did not at all que&s;tion his learning and abili|ties&punc;
and particularly his &s;k$l$ in cookery, which
he &s;hould never forget while his palate retained
its function; but neverthele&s;s advi&s;ed him, for
the &s;ake of the degenerate eaters of the&s;e days,
to &s;pare a little of his &s;al armoniac in the next
&s;ill$kickab$ he &s;hould prepare; and bate &s;ome|what
of the devil's dung, which he had &s;o p$en|tifully
crammed into the roa&s;ted fowls, unle&s;s he
had a mind to convert his gue&s;ts into patients,
with a view of licking him&s;elf whole for the ex|pence
of the entertainment.</P>
<P>The phy&s;ician, nettled at the&s;e &s;arca&s;ms, eyed
him with a look of indignation and di&s;dain, and
being unwilling to expre&s;s him&s;elf in Engli&s;h, le&s;t
in the cour&s;e of the altercation Pallet &s;hould be
&s;o much irritated as to depart without him, he
vented his anger in Greek, pronouncing with
great rancour, <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">.
The pain|ter,
though by the &s;ound he &s;uppo&s;ed this quo|tation
to be Greek, complimented his friend up|on
his knowledge in the Welch language, and
found means to rally him quite out of temper;
&s;o that he retired to his own chamber in the ut|mo&s;t
<PB N="115" REF="124">
wrath and mortification, and left his anta|goni&s;t
exulting o'er the victory he had won.</P>
<P>While the&s;e things pa&s;&s;ed between the&s;e ori|ginals,
Peregrine waited upon the Emba&s;&s;ador,
whom he thanked for his kind interpo&s;ition, ac|knowledging
the indi&s;cretion of his own conduct
with &s;uch appearance of conviction, and promi&s;es
of reformation, that his Excellency freely for|gave
him for all the trouble he had been put to
on his account, fortified him with &s;en&s;ible ad|vices,
and a&s;&s;uring him of his continua$ favour
and friend&s;hip, gave him at parting, letters of in|troduction
to &s;everal per&s;ons of quality belonging
to the Briti&s;h court.</P>
<P>Thus di&s;tingui&s;hed, our young gentleman took
leave of all his French acquaintance, and &s;pent
the evening with &s;ome of tho&s;e who had en|joyed
the greate&s;t &s;hare of his intimac$ and con|fidence;
while Jolter &s;uperintended his dome&s;tic
concerns, and with infinite joy be&s;poke a po&s;t|chai&s;e
and hor&s;es, in order to convey him from a
place where he lived in continual apprehen&s;ion of
&s;uffering by the dangerous di&s;po&s;ition of his pu|pil
Every thing being adju&s;ted according to
their plan, they and their fellow-travel$rs next
day dined together, and about four in the after|noon
took their departure in two chai&s;es, e&s;corted
by the valet de chambre, Pipes and the doctor's
lacquey on hor&s;eback, well furni&s;hed with arms
and ammunition, in ca&s;e of being attacked by
robbers on the road.</P>
<P>It was about eleven o'clock at night when they
arrived at Senlis, which was the place at which
they propo&s;ed to lodge, and where they were ob|liged
to knock up the people of the inn, before
they could have their &s;upper prepared. All the
<PB N="116" REF="125">
provi&s;ion in the hou&s;e was but barely &s;ufficient to
furni&s;h one indifferent meal; however, the painter
con&s;oled him&s;elf for the quantity with the quality
of the di&s;hes, one of which was a frica&s;&s;ee of
rabbit, a preparation that he valued above all the
dainties that ever &s;moaked upon the table of the
&s;umptuous Heliogabalus.</P>
<P>He had no &s;ooner expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to this ef|fect,
than our hero, who was almo&s;t ince&s;&s;antly
laying traps for diver&s;ion at his neighbour's ex|pence,
laid hold on the declaration; and recol|lecting
the &s;tory of Scipio and the muleteer in
Gil Blas, re&s;olved to perpetrate a joke upon the
&s;tomach of Pallet, which &s;eemed particularly well
di&s;po&s;ed to an hearty &s;upper. He accordingly
dige&s;ted his plan; and the company being &s;eated
at table, affected to gaze with peculiar eagerne&s;s
at the painter, who had helped him&s;elf to a large
portion of the frica&s;&s;ee, and began to &s;wallow it
with infinite reli&s;h. Pallet, notwith&s;tanding the
keenne&s;s of his appetite, could not help taking
notice of Pickle's demeanour; and making a
&s;hort pau&s;e in the exerci&s;e of his grinders, &startq;You
are &s;urprized (&s;aid he) to &s;ee me make &s;o much
di&s;patch; but I was extremely hungry, and this
is one of the be&s;t frica&s;&s;ees I ever ta&s;ted: the
French are very expert in the&s;e di&s;hes, that I
mu&s;t allow; and upon my con&s;cience, I would
never de&s;ire to eat a more delicate rabbit than this
that lies upon my plate.&endq;</P>
<P>Peregrine made no other reply to this enco|mium,
than the repetition of the word rabbit! with
a note of admiration, and &s;uch a &s;ignificant &s;hake
of the head, as effectually alarmed the other,
who in&s;tantly &s;u&s;pended the action of his jaws,
and with the mor&s;el half chewed in his mouth,
<PB N="117" REF="126">
&s;tared round him with a certain &s;tolidity of ap|prehen&s;ion,
which is ea&s;ier conceived than de|&s;cribed,
until his eyes encountered the counte|nance
of Thomas Pipes, who being in&s;tructed,
and po&s;ted oppo&s;ite to him for the occa&s;ion, ex|hibited
an arch grin, that compleated the painter's
di&s;order. Afraid of &s;wallowing his mouthful, and
a&s;hamed to di&s;po&s;e of it any other way, he &s;at
&s;ome time in a mo&s;t di&s;tre&s;&s;ed &s;tate of &s;u&s;pence;
and being que&s;tioned by Mr. Jolter touching his
calamity, made a violent effort of the mu&s;cles of
his gullet, which with difficulty performed their
office; and then, with great confu&s;ion and con|cern,
a&s;ked if Mr. Pickle &s;u&s;pected the rabbit's
identity. The young gentleman a&s;&s;uming a my|&s;te$$us
air, pretended ignorance of the matter,
ob&s;erving, that he was apt to &s;u&s;pect all di&s;hes of
that kind, &s;ince he had been informed of the
tricks which were commonly played at inns in
France, Italy and Spain, and recounted that pa&s;|&s;age
in Gil Blas, which we have hinted at above;
&s;aying, he did not pretend to be a connoi&s;&s;eur in
a$$mals, but the legs of the creature which com|po&s;ed
that frica&s;&s;ee did not, in his opinion, re|&s;em$$e
tho&s;e of the rabbits he had u&s;ually &s;een.
This ob&s;ervation had an evident effect upon the
features of the painter, who with certain &s;igns of
loathing and a&s;toni&s;hment, exclaimed, &startq;Lord
Je&s;us!&endq; and appealed to Pipes for a di&s;covery of
the truth, by a&s;king if he knew any thing of the
affair. Tom very gravely replied, that he did
&s;uppo&s;e the food was whole&s;ome enough, for he
had &s;een the &s;kin and feet of a &s;pecial ram-cat,
n$w flea'd, hanging upon the door of a &s;mall
pantry adjoining to the kitchen.</P>
<P><PB N="118" REF="127">
Before this &s;entence was uttered, Pallet's belly
&s;eemed to move in contact with his back-bone,
his colour changed, no part but the whites of his
eyes were to be &s;een, he dropped his lower jaw,
and fixing his hands in his &s;ides, reached with
&s;uch convul&s;ive agonies, as amazed and di&s;con|certed
the whole company; and what augmented
his di&s;order, was the tenacious retention of his
&s;tomach, which ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed to part with
its contents, notwith&s;tanding all the energy of
his abhorrence, which threw him into a cold
&s;weat, and almo&s;t into a &s;woon.</P>
<P>Pickle, alarmed at his condition, a&s;&s;ured him it
was a genuine rabbit, and that he had tutored Pipes
to &s;ay otherwi&s;e for the joke's &s;ake. But this confe&s;|&s;ion
he con&s;idered as a friendly artifice of Pickle's
com$a&s;&s;ion, and therefore it had little effect upon
his con&s;titution. By the a&s;&s;i&s;tance&punc; however, of a
large bumper of brandy, his &s;pirits were recruited,
and his recollection &s;o far recovered, that he was
able to declare, with divers contor&s;ions of face,
that the di&s;h had a particular rankne&s;s of ta&s;te,
which he had imputed partly to the nature of the
French coney, and partly to the compo&s;ition of
their &s;auces; then he inveighed again&s;t the infa|mous
practices of French publicans, attributing
&s;uch impo&s;ition to their oppre&s;&s;ive government,
which kept them &s;o nece&s;&s;itous, that they were
tempted to exerci&s;e all manner of knavery upon
their unwary gue&s;ts.</P>
<P>Jolter, who could not find in his heart to let
&s;lip any opportunity of &s;peaking in favour of the
French, told him that he was a very great &s;tranger
to their police, el&s;e he would know, that if up|on
information to the magi&s;trate, it &s;hould ap|pear
that any traveller, native or fore$gner, has
<PB N="119" REF="128">
been impo&s;ed upon, or ill-treated by a publican,
the offender would be immediately obliged to
&s;hut up his hou&s;e, and if his behaviour had been
notorious, he him&s;elf would be &s;ent to the gal|lies,
without the lea&s;t he&s;itation; and as for the
di&s;h which hath been made the occa&s;ion of your
pre&s;ent di&s;order, (&s;aid he) I will take upon me
to affirm, it was prepared of a genuine rabbit,
which was &s;kinned in my pre&s;ence; and in con|firmation
of what I a&s;&s;ert, though &s;uch frica&s;&s;ees
are not the favourites of my ta&s;te, I will eat a
part of this without &s;cruple.&endq; So &s;aying, he
&s;wallowed &s;everal mouthfuls of the que&s;tioned
coney, and Pallet &s;eemed to eye it again with in|clination;
nay, he even re&s;umed his knife and
fork, and being ju&s;t on the point of applying
them, was &s;eized with another qualm of appre|hen&s;ion,
that broke out in an exclamation of,
&startq;After all, Mr. J$lter, if it &s;h$uld be a real
ram-cat&mdash;Lord have mercy upon me! here is
one of the claws.&endq; With the&s;e words he pre|&s;ented
the tip of a toe, of which Pipes had &s;nipt
off five or &s;ix from a duck that was roa&s;ted, and
purpo&s;ely &s;cattered them in the fric$$&s;&s;$e: and the
governor could not behold this te&s;timonial with|out
&s;ymptoms of unea&s;ine&s;s and r$mor&s;e; &s;o that
he and the painter &s;at &s;ilenced and abathed, and
made faces at each other, while $he phy&s;ician,
who hated them both, exulted over their afflic|tion,
bidding them be of good c$ear, and pro|ceed
with their meal; for he was ready to de|mon&s;trate,
that the fle&s;h of a $at was as nou|ri&s;hing
and delicious as veal or mutton&punc; provided
they could prove, that the &s;aid cat was not of the
boar-kind, and had fed chiefly on vegetable diet,
or even confined its carnivorous appetite to rats
<PB N="120" REF="129">
and mice, which he affirmed to be dainties of
exqui&s;ite ta&s;te and flavour. He &s;aid, it was a vul|gar
mi&s;take to think that all fle&s;h-devouring crea|tures
were unfit to be eaten; witne&s;s the con|&s;umption
of &s;wine and ducks, animals that de|light
in carnage, as well as fi&s;h, that prey upon
each other, and feed on bait and carrion; toge|ther
with the demand for bear, of which the
be&s;t hams in the world are made. He then ob|&s;erved,
that the Negroes on the coa&s;t of Guinea,
who are a healthy and vigorous people, prefer
cats and dogs to all other fare; and mentioned
from hi&s;tory &s;everal &s;ieges, during which the in|habitants,
who were blocked up, lived upon
the&s;e animals, and had recour&s;e even to human
fle&s;h, which, to his certain knowledge, was in
all re&s;pects preferable to pork; for, in the cour&s;e
of his &s;tudies, he had, for the experiment's &s;ake,
eaten a &s;teak cut from the buttock of a per&s;on
who had been hanged.</P>
<P>This di&s;&s;ertation, far from compo&s;ing, increa&s;ed
the di&s;quiet in the &s;tomachs of the governor and
painter, who hearing the la&s;t illu&s;tration, turned
their eyes upon the orator, at the &s;ame in&s;tant,
with looks of horror and di&s;gu&s;t; and the one
muttering the term <HI>Cannibal,</HI> and the other pro|nouncing
the word <HI>abomination,</HI> they ro&s;e from ta|ble
in a great hurry, and running towards another
apartment, ju&s;tled with &s;uch violence in the pa&s;|&s;age,
that both were overturned by the &s;hock,
which al&s;o contributed to the effect of their nau|&s;ea,
that mutually defiled them as they lay.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. LIII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Nor is the phy&s;ician &s;acred from his ridicule. They
reach Arras, where our adventurer engages in
play with two French officers, who next morning
give the landlord an intere&s;ting proof of their
importance.</HEAD>
<P>THOUGH Pickle enjoyed their di&s;a&s;ter,
he was re&s;olved to practi&s;e &s;ome invention
upon the doctor, that he might not triumph in
his revenge with impunity; and thus determined,
when Pallet had overcome the malady of his own
imagination, he imparted to him a plan of re|prizal,
which agreeably flattered his re&s;entment,
and was executed in this manner: as the painter
and phy&s;ician lay in &s;eparate beds in the &s;ame
chamber, the former watched, till by the other's
&s;noring he was certified of his being fa&s;t a&s;leep;
then moving &s;oftly to the door, where Pipes
&s;tood ready furni&s;hed for the purpo&s;e, took a
tea-kettle full of warm water, and cautiou&s;ly
conveying the &s;pout under the cloaths of the doc|tor's
bed, poured in the liquor, imperceptibly,
to the quantity of half a gallon, and then retired
to re&s;t.</P>
<P>Peregrine having undertaken to rouze his fel|low-travellers
in the morning, entered the doc|tor's
apartment with the dawn, and waked them
both with the &s;ame hollow. The painter imme|diately
&s;prung out of bed; but the phy&s;ician,
finding him&s;elf drenched from head to foot, was
equally a&s;toni&s;hed and a&s;hamed, never doubting
that he had unfortunately bedewed him&s;elf in his
fleep. This mi&s;take he thought &s;o incon&s;i&s;tent
<PB N="122" REF="131">
with the dignity of his character, that he dur&s;t
not venture to di&s;clo&s;e his condition, e&s;pecially
as he well knew how eagerly the company would
&s;eize &s;uch an occa&s;ion of making merry at his
expence; and it would be impracticable to con|ceal
it from their knowledge, if he &s;hould be ob|liged
to get up in their pre&s;ence: he therefore
lay &s;till in the utmo&s;t perplexity and tribulation,
while his two companions, gue&s;&s;ing his thoughts,
and rejoicing at his anxiety, &s;at down by his bed|&s;ide,
and exhorted him to ri&s;e. He told them,
that having &s;weated profu&s;ely all night, he could
not, with any regard to his health, get up, until
he &s;hould be &s;hifted, and the pores of his &s;kin
regularly clo&s;ed; and in the mean time, de&s;ired
they would take the trouble of &s;eeing the hor&s;es
put to the chai&s;es, and the reckoning adju&s;ted;
a&s;&s;uring them, he &s;hould be ready to attend them
before their bu&s;ine&s;s could be di&s;patched. Our
young gentleman gave him to under&s;tand, that
Mr. Jolter had charged him&s;elf with the payment
of the bill, and the &s;ervants were now employed
about the carriages, &s;o that he had not a moment
to lo&s;e; he therefore rung the bell for his foot|man,
and bade him bring a clean &s;hirt for his
ma&s;ter with all po&s;&s;ible &s;peed.</P>
<P>Ere the fellow returned, it was broad day;
and a me&s;&s;age came from the governor, import|ing
that the hor&s;es were yoked. The doctor's
confu&s;ion increa&s;ed, he was tortured by the looks,
and baited by the importunities of his company;
and moreover, &s;uffered the uncomfortable &s;itua|tion
of being &s;teeped, as he imagined, in his own
brine. At length Peregrine, impatient of his
delay, took the privilege of a comrade, and ac|cu&s;ing
the republican of &s;loth, pulled off the bed-cloaths
<PB N="123" REF="132">
at one &s;natch, and di&s;played him at full
length, in this opprobrious condition.</P>
<P>The painter &s;eeing him thus expo&s;ed, lifted up
his hands, and in affected a&s;toni&s;hment, &startq;Lord
watch over us! (cried he) the doctor is a dead
man; &s;ure the whole &s;ap of his body is run out,
or have you &s;pilt a whole di&s;h of fillykickaby in
the bed? for it &s;mells cur&s;edly &s;trong of &s;al ar|moniac.&endq;
Peregrine, in order to compleat the
phy&s;ician's overthrow, &s;hut up his no&s;trils with
his finger and thumb, and a&s;ked in a &s;nuffling
tone, if he was &s;ubject to that infirmity.</P>
<P>Un&s;peakable were the &s;hame and vexation of
the modern Pindar on this occa&s;ion; he was at
the &s;ame time tormented with all the pangs which
mortified vanity can feel, and agitated by all the
furies of re&s;entment again&s;t the per&s;ons who had
detected his di&s;grace, and who having thus in|&s;ulted
him in his di&s;tre&s;s, quitted the room with a
loud laugh, leaving him to the thorny reflections
of his own pride. Nor could the painter, who
was not at all to be prai&s;ed for his moderation,
ab&s;tain from certain ill-natured allu&s;ions to his
calamity, which by the&s;e means reached the ears
of the governor, from whom (of all men) he
de&s;ired to keep it concealed; &s;o that he remained
&s;ullen and dejected during the whole journey:
not but that he attempted to recover his impor|tance,
by haranguing upon the Roman highways,
when Mr. Jolter de&s;ired the company to take no|tice
of the fine pavement upon which they tra|velled
from Paris into Flanders; but Pallet, who
thought he had now gained the a&s;cendency over
the phy&s;ician, exerted him&s;elf in maintaining the
&s;uperiority he had acquired, by venting various
$word$ upon his &s;elf-conceit and affectation of
<PB N="124" REF="133">
learning, and even uttering puns and conundrums
upon the remarks which the republican retailed.
When he talked of the Flaminian Way, the
painter que&s;tioned if it was a better pavement
than the Fleminian way on which they travelled:
and the doctor having ob&s;erved, that this road
was made for the convenience of drawing the
French artillery into Flanders, which was often
the &s;eat of war; his competitor in wit replied
with infinite vivacity, &startq;There are more great
guns than the French king knows of drawn along
this cau&s;eway, doctor.&endq;</P>
<P>Encouraged by the &s;ucce&s;s of the&s;e efforts,
which tickled the imagination of Jolter, and
drew &s;miles (as he imagined) of approbation from
our hero, he &s;ported in many other aequivoques
of the &s;ame nature; and at dinner told the phy|&s;ician,
that he was like the root of the tongue,
as being cur&s;edly down in the mouth.</P>
<P>By this time, &s;uch was the animo&s;ity &s;ub&s;i&s;t|ing
between the&s;e quondam friends, that they
never conver&s;ed together, except with a view of
expo&s;ing each other to the ridicule or contempt
of their fellow-travellers. The doctor was at
great pains to point out the folly and ignorance
of Pallet in private to Peregrine, who was often
conjured in the &s;ame manner by the painter, to
take notice of the phy&s;ician's want of manners
and ta&s;te. Pickle pretended to acquie&s;ce in the
truth of their mutual &s;everity, which indeed was
extremely ju&s;t, and by malicious in&s;inuations
blew up their contention, with a view of bringing
it to open ho&s;tility. But, both &s;eemed &s;o aver&s;e
to deeds of mortal purpo&s;e, that for a long time
his arts were baffled, and he could not &s;pirit them
<PB N="125" REF="134">
up to any pitch of re&s;entment higher than &s;cur|ri$ous
repartee.</P>
<P>Before they reached Arras, the city-gates were
&s;hut, &s;o that they were obliged to take up their
lodging at an indifferent hou&s;e in the &s;uburbs,
where they found a couple of French officers,
who had al&s;o rode po&s;t from Paris, &s;o far on their
way to Li&s;le. The&s;e gentlemen were about the
age of thirty, and their deportment di&s;tingui&s;hed
by &s;uch an air of in&s;olence, as di&s;gu&s;ted our hero,
who, neverthele&s;s, acco&s;ted them politely in the
$word$, and propo&s;ed that they &s;hould &s;up together.
They thanked him for the honour of his invita|tion,
which, however, they declined, upon pre|tence
of having ordered &s;omething for them&s;elves;
$ut promi&s;ed to wait upon him and his company
immediately after their repa&s;t.</P>
<P>This they accordingly performed; and after
having drank a few gla&s;&s;es of Burgundy, one of
them a&s;ked, if the young gentleman would, for
pa&s;time, take an hand at quadrille. Peregrine
ea&s;ily divined the meaning of this propo&s;al, which
was made with no other view than that of &s;leecing
him and his fellow-travellers; for he well knew
to what &s;hifts a &s;ubaltern in the French &s;ervice is
reduced, in order to maintain the appearance of a
gentleman, and had rea&s;on to believe that mo&s;t of
them were &s;harpers from their youth: but, as he
depended a good deal upon his own penetration
and addre&s;s, he gratified the &s;tranger's de&s;ire;
and a party was in&s;tantly formed of the painter,
the phy&s;ician, the propo&s;er and him&s;elf, the other
officer having profe&s;&s;ed him&s;elf utterly ignorant
of the game; yet, in the cour&s;e of the play, he
took his &s;tation at the back of Pickle's chair,
which was oppo&s;ite to his friend, on pretence of
<PB N="126" REF="135">
him&s;elf with &s;eeing his manner of conducting
the cards. The youth was not &s;uch a novice
but that he perceived the de&s;ign of this palpable
piece of behaviour, which, notwith&s;tanding, he
overlook'd for the pre&s;ent, with a view of flat|tering
their hopes in the beginning, that they
might be the more effectually puni&s;hed, by their
di&s;appointment in the end.</P>
<P>The game was &s;carce begun, when by the re|flection
of a gla&s;s he di&s;cerned the officer at his
back, making &s;igns to his companion, who, by the&s;e
pre-concerted ge&s;tures, was perfectly informed
of the contents of Peregrine's hand, and of con|&s;equence
fortunate in the cour&s;e of play.</P>
<P>Thus they were allowed to enjoy the fruits of
their dexterity, until their money amounted to
&s;ome Loui's; when our young gentleman, think|ing
it high time to do him&s;elf ju&s;tice, &s;ignified in
very polite terms to the gentleman who &s;tood be|hind
him, that he could never play with ea&s;e
and deliberation when he was overlooked by any
by-&s;tander, and begg'd that he would have the
goodne&s;s to be &s;eated.</P>
<P>As this was a remon&s;trance which the &s;tranger
could not with any &s;hew of breeding re&s;i&s;t, he
a&s;ked pardon, and retired to the chair of the
phy&s;ician, who frankly told him, that it was not
the fa&s;hion of his country for one to &s;ubmit his
hand to the peru&s;al of a &s;pectator; and when, in
con&s;equence of this rebuff, he wanted to quarter
him&s;elf upon the painter, he was refu&s;ed by a
wave of the hand, and a &s;hake of the head, with
an exclamation of, <HI>Pardonnez moi!</HI> which was
repeated with &s;uch empha&s;is, as di&s;compo&s;ed his
effrontery, and he found him&s;elf obliged to &s;it
down in a &s;tate of mortification.</P>
<P><PB N="127" REF="136">
The odds being thus removed, fortune pro|ceeded
in her u&s;ual channel; and though the
Frenchman, deprived of his ally, endeavoured
to practi&s;e divers &s;trokes of fine&s;&s;e, the re&s;t of
the company ob&s;erved him with &s;uch vigilance
and caution, as baffled all his attempts, and in a
very little time he was compelled to part with
his winning: but having engaged in the match
with an intention of taking all advantages, whe|ther
fair or unfair, that his &s;uperior &s;kill &s;hould
give him over the Engli&s;hmen, the money was
not refunded without a thou&s;and di&s;putes, in the
cour&s;e of which he e&s;&s;ayed to intimidate his an|tagoni&s;t
with high words, which were retorted
by our hero with &s;uch intere&s;t, as convinced him
that he had mi&s;taken his man, and per&s;uaded him
to make his retreat in quiet. Indeed, it was not
without cau&s;e that they repined at the bad &s;uc|ce&s;s
of their enterprize; becau&s;e, in all likeli|hood,
they had nothing to depend upon for the
pre&s;ent but their own indu&s;try, and knew not
how to defray their expences on the road, except
by &s;ome acqui&s;ition of this kind.</P>
<P>Next morning they ro&s;e at day-break, and re|&s;olving
to anticipate their fellow-lodgers, be&s;poke
po&s;t-hor&s;es as &s;oon as they could be admitted into
the city; &s;o that when our company appeared,
their bea&s;ts were ready in the yard; and they
only waited to di&s;cu&s;s the bill, which they had
ordered to be made out. The landlord of the
inn pre&s;ented his carte with fear and trembling to
one of tho&s;e ferocious cavaliers, who no &s;ooner
ca&s;t his eye upon the &s;um total, than he di&s;charged
a volley of dreadful oaths, and a&s;ked if the king's
officers were to be treated in that manner. The
poor publican prote&s;ted with great humility, that
<PB N="128" REF="137">
he had the utmo&s;t re&s;pect for his maje&s;ty, and
every thing that belonged to him; and that, far
from con&s;ulting his own intere&s;t, all that he de|&s;ired
was, to be barely indemnified for the ex|pence
of their lodging.</P>
<P>This conde&s;cen&s;ion &s;eemed to have no other
effect than that of encouraging their arrogance.
They &s;wore his extortion &s;hould be explained to
the commandant of the town, who would, by
making him a public example, teach other inn-keepers
how to behave towards men of honour;
and threatened with &s;uch confidence of indigna|tion,
that the wretched landlord, dreading the
con&s;equence of their wrath, implored pardon in
the mo&s;t abject manner, begging with many &s;up|plications,
that he might have the plea&s;ure of
lodging them at his own charge. This was a
favour which he with great difficulty obtained;
they chid him &s;everely for his impo&s;ition, ex|horted
him to have more regard for his own con|&s;cience,
as well as for the convenience of his
gue&s;ts; and cautioning him in particular touching
his behaviour to the gentlemen of the army,
mounted their hor&s;es, and rode off in great &s;tate,
leaving him very thankful for having &s;o &s;ucce&s;&s;|fully
appea&s;ed the choler of two officers, who
wanted either inclination or ability to pay their
bill: for experience had taught him to be ap|prehen&s;ive
of all &s;uch travellers, who commonly
$$y the landlord under contribution, by way of
atonement for the extravagance of his demands,
even after he has profe&s;&s;ed his willingne&s;s to en|tertain
them on their own terms.</P>

<P>THESE honourable adventurers being gone,
Peregrine, who was pre&s;ent during the

from the mouth of the inn-keeper him&s;elf, who
took God and the &s;aints to witne&s;s, that he

which would be &s;ufficient to ruin him
from top to bottom.</P>
<P>Our hero boiled with indignation at this in|&s;tance
of inju&s;tice and arbitrary power; and turn|ing
to his governor, a&s;ked if this too was a proof
of the happine&s;s enjoyed by the French people.
Jolter replied, that e$ery human con&s;titution
mu&s;t in &s;ome things be imperfect; and owned,
that in this kingdom gentlemen were more coun|tenanced
than the vulgar, becau&s;e it was to be pre|&s;umed,
<PB N="130" REF="139">
that their own &s;entiments of honour and
&s;uperior qualifications, would entitle them to this
preheminence, which had al&s;o a retro&s;pective
view to the merit of their ance&s;tors, in con&s;ide|ration
of which they were at fir&s;t ennobled: but
he affirmed, that the inn-keeper had mi&s;repre|&s;ented
the magi&s;tracy, which in France never
failed to puni&s;h flagrant outrages and abu&s;e, with|out
re&s;pect of per&s;ons.</P>
<P>The painter approved of the wi&s;dom of the
French government, in bridling the in&s;olence of
the mob, by which, he a&s;&s;ured them, he had
often &s;uffered in his own per&s;on; having been
often be&s;pattered by hackney-coachmen, ju&s;tled
by draymen and porters, and reviled in the mo&s;t
opprobrious terms by the watermen of London,
where he had once lo&s;t his bag, and a con&s;iderable
quantity of hair, which had been cut off by
&s;ome ra&s;cal in his pa&s;&s;age through Ludgate, during
the lord mayor's proce&s;&s;ion. On the other hand,
the doctor with great warmth alledged, that tho&s;e
officers ought to &s;uffer death, or bani&s;hment at
lea&s;t, for having plundered the people in this
manner, which was &s;o impudent and barefaced,
as plainly to prove they were certain of e&s;caping
with impunity, and that they were old offenders
in the &s;ame degree of delinquency. He &s;aid,
that the greate&s;t man in Athens would have been
condemned to perpetual exile, and &s;een his e&s;tate
confi&s;cated for public u&s;e, had he dared in &s;uch
a licentious manner to violate the rights of a fel|low-citizen:
and as for the little affronts to
which a man may be &s;ubject, from the petulance
of the multitude, he looked upon them as glo|rious
indications of liberty, which ought not to
be repre&s;&s;ed, and would at any time rejoice to
<PB N="131" REF="140">
find him&s;elf overthrown in a kennel by the in&s;o|lence
of a &s;on of freedom, even though the fall
&s;hould co&s;t him a limb: adding, by way of il|lu&s;tration,
that the greate&s;t plea&s;ure he ever en|joyed,
was in &s;eeing a du&s;tman wilfully overturn
a gentleman's coach, in which two ladies were
brui&s;ed, even to the danger of their lives. Pallet,
&s;hocked at the extravagance of this declaration,
&startq;If that be the ca&s;e (&s;aid he) I wi&s;h you may
&s;ee every bone in your body broke, by the fir&s;t
carman you meet in the &s;treets of London.&endq;</P>
<P>This argument being di&s;cu&s;&s;ed, and the reck|oning
di&s;charged without any deduction, although
the landlord, in &s;tating the articles, had an eye
to the lo&s;s he had &s;u&s;tained by his own country|men,
they departed from Arras, and arrived in
&s;afety at Li&s;le, about two o'clock in the after|noon.</P>
<P>They had &s;carce taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their lodg|ings,
in a large hotel on the Grande Place, when
the inn-keeper gave them to under&s;tand, that
he kept an ordinary below, which was frequented
by &s;everal Engli&s;h gentlemen who re&s;ided in
town, and that dinner was then upon the table.
Peregrine, who &s;eized all opportunities of ob|&s;erving
new characters, per&s;uaded his company
to dine in public; and they were accordingly
conducted to the place, where they found a
mixture of Scotch and Dutch officers, who
had come from Holland to learn their exerci&s;es
at the academy, and &s;ome gentlemen in the
French &s;ervice, who were upon gari&s;on-duty in
the citadel. Among the&s;e la&s;t was a per&s;on about
the age of fifty, of a remarkably genteel air
and polite addre&s;s, dignified with a Malte&s;e cro&s;s,
and di&s;tingui&s;hed by the particular veneration
of all tho&s;e who knew him. When he under|&s;tood
<PB N="132" REF="141">
that Pickle and his friends were travellers,
he acco&s;ted the youth in Engli&s;h, which he &s;poke
tolerably well; and as they were &s;trangers, of|fered
to attend them in the afternoon to all the
places worth &s;eeing in Li&s;le. Our hero thanked
him for his exce&s;s of politene&s;s, which (he &s;aid)
was peculiar to the French nation; and &s;truck
with his engaging appearance, indu&s;triou&s;ly court|ed
his conver&s;ation, in the cour&s;e of which he
learnt, that this chevalier was a man of good
&s;en&s;e and great experience, that he was perfectly
well acquainted with the greate&s;t part of Europe,
had lived &s;ome years in England, and was no
&s;tranger to the con&s;titution and genius of that
people.</P>
<P>Having dined, and drank to the healths of the
Engli&s;h and French kings, two Fiacres were
called, in one of which the knight, with one of
his companions, the governor and Peregrine
&s;eated them&s;elves, the other being occupied by
the phy&s;ician, Pallet, and two Scotti&s;h officers,
who propo&s;ed to accompany them in their circuit.
The fir&s;t place they vi&s;ited was the citadel, round
the ramparts of which they walked, under the
conduct of the knight, who explained with great
accuracy the intention of every particular fortifi|cation
belonging to, that &s;eemingly impregnable
fortre&s;s; and when they had &s;atisfied their cu|rio&s;ity,
took coach again, in order to view the
ar&s;enal, which &s;tands in another quarter of the
town: but, ju&s;t as Pickle's carriage had cro&s;&s;ed
the Promenade, he heard his own name bawled
aloud by the painter; and ordering the Fiacre to
&s;top, &s;aw Pallet with one half of his body thru&s;t
out at the window of the other coach, crying
with a terrified look, &startq;Mr. Pickle, Mr. Pickle,
<PB N="133" REF="142">
for the love of God! halt, and prevent blood|&s;hed,
el&s;e here will be carnage and cutting of
throats.&endq; Peregrine, &s;urprized at this exclama|tion,
immediately alighted, and advancing to
the other vehicle, found one of their military
companions &s;tanding upon the ground, at the fur|ther
&s;ide of the coach, with his &s;word drawn,
and fury in his countenance; and the phy&s;ician,
with a quivering lip and haggard a&s;pect, &s;truggling
with the other, who had interpo&s;ed in the quarrel,
and detained him in his place.</P>
<P>Our young gentleman, upon inquiry, found
that this animo&s;ity had &s;prung from a di&s;pute that
happened upon the ramparts, touching the &s;trength
of the fortification, which the doctor, according
to cu&s;tom, undervalued, becau&s;e it was a mo|dern
work; &s;aying, that by the help of the mi|litary
engines u&s;ed among the ancients, and a
few thou&s;ands of pioneers, he would engage to
take it in le&s;s than ten days after he &s;hould &s;it
down before it. The North-Briton, who was
as great a pedant as the phy&s;ician, having &s;tudied
fortification, and made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of Cae&s;ar's
Commentaries and Polybius, with the ob&s;erva|tions
of Folard, affirmed, that all the methods
of be&s;ieging practi&s;ed by the ancients, would be
utterly ineffectual again&s;t &s;uch a plan as that of
the citadel of Li&s;le; and began to compare the
Vineae, Aggeres, Arietes, Scorpiones and Cata|pultae
of the Romans, with the trenches, mines,
batteries and mortars u&s;ed in the pre&s;ent art of
war. The republican, finding him&s;elf attacked
upon what he thought his &s;trong &s;ide, &s;ummoned
all his learning to his aid; and de&s;cribing the fa|mous
&s;iege of Plataea, happened to mi&s;q$ote a
pa&s;&s;age of Thucydides, in which he was cor|rected
<PB N="144" REF="143">
by the other, who having been educated
for the church, was al&s;o a connoi&s;&s;eur in the
Greek language. The doctor, incen&s;ed at being
detected in &s;uch a blunder, in pre&s;ence of Pallet,
who (he knew) would promulgate his &s;hame,
told the officer, with great arrogance, that his
objection was frivolous, and that he mu&s;t not
pretend to di&s;pute on the&s;e matters with one who
had con&s;idered them with the utmo&s;t accuracy
and care. His antagoni&s;t, piqued at this &s;uper|cilious
in&s;inuation, replied with great heat, that
for ought he knew, the doctor might be a very
expert apothecary, but that in the art of war,
and knowledge in the Greek tongue, he was no
other than an ignorant pretender. This a&s;&s;eve|ration
produced an an&s;wer full of virulence, in|cluding
a national reflection upon the &s;oldier's
country; and the contention ro&s;e to mutual
abu&s;e, when it was &s;uppre&s;&s;ed by the admoni|tions
of the other two, who begged they would
not expo&s;e them&s;elves in a &s;trange place, but be|have
them&s;elves like fellow-&s;ubjects and friends.
They accordingly cea&s;ed reviling each other, and
the affair was &s;eemingly forgot; but, after they
had re&s;umed their places in the coach, the pain|ter
unfortunately a&s;ked the meaning of the
word Tortoi&s;e, which he had heard them men|tion
among the Roman implements of war.
This que&s;tion was an&s;wered by the phy&s;ician,
who de&s;cribed the nature of this expedient &s;o
little to the &s;atisfaction of the officer, that he
contradicted him flatly, in the mid&s;t of his expla|nation;
a circum&s;tance which provoked the re|publican
to &s;uch a degree, that in the temerity
of his pa&s;&s;ion, he uttered the epithet <HI>impertinent
&s;coundrel;</HI> which was no &s;ooner pronounced
<PB N="135" REF="144">
than the Caledonian made manual application
to his no&s;e, and leaping out of the coach, &s;tood
waiting for him on the plain; while he (the
phy&s;ician) made feeble efforts to join him,
being ea&s;ily retained by the other &s;oldier; and
Pallet, dreading the con&s;equence in which he him|&s;elf
might be involved, bellowed aloud for pre|vention.</P>
<P>Our hero endeavoured to quiet the commo|tion,
by repre&s;enting to the Scot, that he had
already taken &s;atisfaction for the injury he had
received; and telling the doctor, that he had de|&s;erved
the cha&s;ti&s;ement which was inflicted upon
him: but the officer (encouraged perhaps by the
confu&s;ion of his antagoni&s;t) in&s;i&s;ted upon his a&s;k|ing
pardon for what he had &s;aid; and the doctor,
believing him&s;elf under the protection of his friend
Pickle, far from agreeing to &s;uch conce&s;&s;ion,
breathed nothing but defiance and revenge: &s;o
that the chevalier, in order to prevent mi&s;chief,
put the &s;oldier under arre&s;t, and &s;ent him to his
lodgings, under the care of the other French
gentleman and his own companion; they being
al&s;o accompanied by Mr. Jolter, who having
formerly &s;een all the curio&s;ities of Li&s;le, willingly
&s;urrendered his place to the phy&s;ician.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. LV.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Pickle engages with a knight of Malta, in a con|ver&s;ation
upon the Engli&s;h &s;tage, which is fol|lowed
by a di&s;&s;ertation on the theatres of the an|cients,
by the doctor.</HEAD>
<P>THE re&s;t of the company proceeded to the
ar&s;enal, which having viewed, together
with &s;ome remarkable churches, they, in their
return, went to the comedy, and &s;aw the Cid of
Corneille tolerably well repre&s;ented. In con&s;e|quence
of this entertainment, the di&s;cour&s;e at
&s;upper turned upon dramatic performances; and
all the objections of Mon&s;. de Scudery to the
piece they had &s;een acted, together with the de|ci&s;ion
of the French academy, were canva&s;&s;ed
and di&s;cu&s;&s;ed. The knight was a man of letters
and ta&s;te, and particularly well acquainted with
the &s;tate of the Engli&s;h &s;tage; &s;o that when the
painter boldly pronounced &s;entence again&s;t the
French manner of acting, on the &s;trength of
having frequented a Covent-Garden club of cri|ticks,
and been often admitted by virtue of an
order, into the pit; a compari&s;on immediately
en&s;ued, not between the authors, but the actors
of both nations, to whom the chevalier and Pe|regrine
were no &s;trangers. Our hero, like a
good Engli&s;hman, made no &s;cruple of giving the
preference to the performers of his own country,
who, he alledged, obeyed the genuine impul&s;es
of nature, in exhibiting the pa&s;&s;ions of the human
mind; and entered &s;o warmly into the &s;pirit of
their &s;everal parts, that they often fancied them|&s;elves
the very heroes they repre&s;ented. Whereas,
<PB N="137" REF="146">
the action of the Pari&s;ian players, even in their
mo&s;t intere&s;ting characters, was generally &s;uch
an extravagance in voice and ge&s;ture, as is no
where to be ob&s;erved but on the &s;tage. To
illu&s;trate this a&s;&s;ertion, he availed him&s;elf of his
talent, and mimicked the manner and voice of all
the principal performers, male and female, be|longing
to the French comedy; to the admira|tion
of the chevalier, who having complimented
him upon this &s;urpri&s;ing modulation, begged leave
to di&s;&s;ent in &s;ome particulars from the opinion he
had avowed. &startq;That you have good actors in
England, (&s;aid he) it would be unju&s;t and ab&s;urd
in me to deny; your theatre is adorned by one
woman, who&s;e &s;en&s;ibility and &s;weetne&s;s of voice
is &s;uch as I have never ob&s;erved on any other
&s;tage; &s;he has, be&s;ides, an elegance of per&s;on
and expre&s;&s;ion of features, that wonderfully adapt
her for the mo&s;t engaging characters of your be&s;t
plays; and I mu&s;t freely own that I have been
as highly delighted, and as deeply affected, by a
Monimia and Belvidera at London, as ever I
was by a Cornelia and Cleopatra at Paris. You
can, moreover, boa&s;t of &s;everal comic actors who
are perfect ma&s;ters of buffoonery and grimace;
though, to be free with you, I think, in the&s;e
qualifications you are excelled by the players of
Am&s;terdam: neither are you de&s;titute of tho&s;e,
who, with a good deal of cultivation, might ac|quire
&s;ome degree of excellence in the repre&s;enta|tion
of tragic characters: but I &s;hall never cea&s;e
to wonder that the Engli&s;h, who are certainly a
&s;en&s;ible and di&s;cerning people &s;hould be &s;o much
infatuated, as to applaud and care&s;s with the mo&s;t
extravagant approbation, not to &s;ay adoration and
regard, one or two gracio&s;o's, who, I will be
<PB N="138" REF="147">
bold to &s;ay, would &s;carce be able to earn their
bread by their talents, on any other theatre under
the &s;un. I have &s;een one of the&s;e, in the cele|brated
part of Richard the third, which, I be|lieve,
is not a character of ridicule, &s;ollicit and
triumph in the laugh of the audience, during the
be&s;t part of a &s;cene in which the author has re|pre&s;ented
that prince as an object of abhorrence.
I have ob&s;erved the &s;ame per&s;on in the character
of Hamlet, &s;hake his fi&s;t with all the demon&s;tra|tions
of wrath at his mi&s;tre&s;s, for no evident
cau&s;e, and behave like a ruffian to his own mo|ther.
Shocked at &s;uch want of dignity and deco|rum
in a prince, who &s;eemed the favourite of the
people, I condemned the genius that produced
him, but, upon a &s;econd peru&s;al of the play,
transferred my cen&s;ure to the actor, who, in my
opinion, had egregiou&s;ly mi&s;taken the meaning
of the poet. At a ju$$ture, when his whole &s;oul
ought to be alarmed wit$ terror and amazement,
and all his attention engro&s;&s;ed by the dreadful
object in view, I mean that of his friend whom
he had murthered; he expre&s;&s;es no pa&s;&s;ion but
that of indignation again&s;t a drinking gla&s;s,
which he violently da&s;hes in pieces on the floor,
as if he had perceived a &s;pider in his wine; nay,
while his eyes are fixed upon the ground, he &s;tarts
at the image of a dagger which he pretends to &s;ee
above his head, as if the pavement was a looking|gla&s;s
that repre&s;ented it by reflexion: and at one
time, I &s;aw him walk a-cro&s;s the &s;tage, and lend
an inferior character a box on the ear, after he
had with great wrath pronounced &startq;Take thou
that,&endq; or &s;ome equivalent exclamation, at the
other end of the &s;cene. He repre&s;ents the grief
of an hero, by the tears and manner of a whin|ing
<PB N="139" REF="148">
&s;chool boy, and perverts the genteel deport|ment
of a gentleman, into the idle buffoonery of
a mi&s;erable tobacconi&s;t; his whole art is no other
than a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of frantic vociferation, &s;uch as
I have heard in the cells of Bedlam, a &s;lowne&s;s,
he&s;itation and oppre&s;&s;ion of &s;peech, as if he was
troubled with an a&s;thma, convul&s;ive &s;tartings,
and a ductility of features, &s;uited to the mo&s;t ex|travagant
tran&s;itions. In a word, he is ble&s;&s;ed
with a di&s;tinct voice, and a great &s;hare of viva|city;
but in point of feeling, judgment, and
grace, is, in my opinion, altogether defective.
Not to mention his impropriety in dre&s;s, which
is &s;o ab&s;urd, that he acts the part of a youthful
prince, in the habit of an undertaker, and exhi|bits
the gay, fa&s;hionable Lothario, in the appear|ance
of a mountebank. I beg pardon for treating
this darling of the Engli&s;h with &s;o little cere|mony;
and to convince you of my candour,
frankly confe&s;s, that notwith&s;tanding all I have
&s;aid, he is qualified to make a con&s;iderable figure
in the low characters of humour, which are &s;o
much reli&s;hed by a London audience, if he could
be prevailed upon to abate of that mon&s;trous bur|le&s;que,
which is an outrage again&s;t nature and
common &s;en&s;e. As for his competitor in &s;ame,
with an equal &s;hare of capacity, he is inferior to
him in per&s;onal agility, &s;prightline&s;s and voice.
His utterance is a continual &s;ing &s;ong, like the
chanting of ve&s;pers, and his action re&s;embles that
of heaving balla&s;t into the hold of a &s;hip. In his
outward deportment, he &s;eems to have confounded
the ideas of dignity and in&s;olence of mien, acts
the crafty, cool, de&s;igning Crookback, as a loud,
&s;hallow, blu&s;tering Hector; in the character of
the mild patriot Brutus, lo&s;es all temper and de|corum;
<PB N="140" REF="149">
nay, &s;o ridiculous is the behaviour of
him and Ca&s;&s;ius at their interview, that &s;etting
foot to foot, and grinning at each other, with
the a&s;pect of two coblers enraged, they thru&s;t
their left &s;ides together, with repeated &s;hocks,
that the hilts of their &s;words may cla&s;h for the
entertainment of the audience; as if they were a
couple of Merry Andrews, endeavouring to rai&s;e
the laugh of the vulgar, on &s;ome &s;caffold at Bar|tholomew
Fair. The de&s;pair of a great man
who falls a &s;acrifice to the infernal practices
of a &s;ubtle traitor, that enjoyed his confi|dence,
this Engli&s;h Ae&s;opus repre&s;ents, by beat|ing
his own forehead, and bellowing like a b$ll;
and indeed, in almo&s;t all his mo&s;t intere&s;ting
&s;cenes, performs &s;uch &s;trange &s;hakings of the
head, and other antic ge&s;ticulations, that when
I fir&s;t &s;aw him act, I imagined the poor man
laboured under that paralytical di&s;order, which
is known by the name of St. Vitus's dance.
In &s;hort, he &s;eems to be a &s;tranger to the more
refined &s;en&s;ations of the &s;oul, con&s;equently his
expre&s;&s;ion is of the vulgar kind, and he mu&s;t
often &s;ink under the idea of the poet; &s;o that he
has recour&s;e to &s;uch violence of affected agitation,
as impo&s;es upon the undi&s;cerning &s;pectator, but
to the eye of ta&s;te, evinces him a meer player
of that cla&s;s whom your admired Shake&s;pear ju&s;tly
compares to nature's journeymen tearing a pa&s;&s;ion
to rags. Yet this man, in &s;pite of all the&s;e ab&s;ur|dities,
is an admirable Fal&s;taff, exhibits the cha|racter
of the eighth Henry to the life, is rea&s;on|ably
applauded in the Plain Dealer, excels in the
part of Sir John Brute, and would be equal to
many humorous &s;ituations in low comedy, which
<PB N="141" REF="150">
his pride will not allow him to undertake. I
&s;hould not have been &s;o &s;evere upon the&s;e rivals,
had not I &s;een them extolled by their partizans,
with the mo&s;t ridiculous and ful&s;ome manife&s;tation
of prai&s;e, even in tho&s;e very circum&s;tances
wherein (as I have ob&s;erved) they chiefly failed.&endq;</P>
<P>Pickle, not a little piqued to hear the quali|fications
of the two mo&s;t celebrated actors in
England treated with &s;uch freedom and di&s;re|&s;pect,
an&s;wered with &s;ome a&s;perity, that the che|valier
was a true critick, more indu&s;trious in ob|&s;erving
the blemi&s;hes than in acknowledging the
excellence of tho&s;e who fell under his examination.
It was not to be &s;uppo&s;ed that one actor could
&s;hine equally in all characters; and though his
ob&s;ervations were undoubtedly very judicious, he
him&s;elf could not help wondering that &s;ome of
them had always e&s;caped his notice, though he
had been an a&s;&s;iduous frequenter of the playhou&s;e.
&startq;The two players in que&s;tion, &s;aid he, have,
in your own opinion, a con&s;iderable &s;hare of me|rit
in the characters of comic life; and as to the
manners of the great per&s;onages in tragedy, and
the operation of the grand pa&s;&s;ions of the &s;oul, I
apprehend, they may be variou&s;ly repre&s;ented,
according to the various complexion and culti|vation
of different men. A Spaniard, for exam|ple,
though impelled by the &s;ame pa&s;&s;ion, will
expre&s;s it very differently from a Frenchman;
and what is looked upon as graceful vivacity and
addre&s;s by the one, would be con&s;idered as im|pertinence
and foppery by the other: nay, &s;o op|po&s;ite
is your common deportment from that of
&s;ome other nations, that one of your own coun|trymen,
in the relation of his travels ob&s;erves,
<PB N="142" REF="151">
that the Per&s;ians even of this age, when they &s;ee
any man perform unnece&s;&s;ary ge&s;tures, &s;ay he
is either a fool or a Frenchman. The &s;tandard
of demeanour being thus un&s;ettled, a Turk, a
Moor, an Indian, or inhabitant of any country,
who&s;e cu&s;toms and dre&s;s are widely different from
ours, may in his &s;entiments, po&s;&s;e&s;s all the dignity
of the human heart, and be in&s;pired by the no|ble&s;t
pa&s;&s;ion that animates the &s;oul, and yet ex|cite
the laughter rather than the re&s;pect of an
European &s;pectator.</P>
<P>When I fir&s;t beheld your famous Pari&s;ian &s;tage-heroine,
in one of her principal parts, her atti|tudes
&s;eemed &s;o violent, and &s;he to&s;&s;ed her arms
around with &s;uch extravagance, that &s;he put me
in mind of a windmill under the agitation of a
hard gale; while her voice and features exhibited
the lively repre&s;entation of an Engli&s;h &s;cold. The
action of your favourite male-performer was, in
my opinion, equally unnatural; he appeared with
the affected airs of a dancing-ma&s;ter; at the mo&s;t
pathetic junctures of his fate, he lifted up his
hands above his head, like a tumbler going to
vault, and &s;poke as if his throat had been ob|&s;tructed
by an hair-bru&s;h; yet, when I compared
their manners with tho&s;e of the people before
whom they performed, and made allowance for
that exaggeration which obtains on all theatres, I
was in&s;en&s;ibly reconciled to their method of per|formance,
and could di&s;tingui&s;h abundance of me|rit
beneath that oddity of appearance.&endq;</P>
<P>The chevalier perceiving Peregrine a little irri|tated
at what he had &s;aid, a&s;ked pardon for the
lib$$$ $span$ taken, in cen&s;uring the Engli&s;h
$span$ that he had an infinite vene|ration
$span$ learning, genius and ta&s;te,
<PB N="143" REF="152">
which were &s;o ju&s;tly di&s;tingui&s;hed in the world of
letters; and that notwith&s;tanding the &s;everity of
his critici&s;m, he thought the theatre of London
much better &s;upplied with actors than that of
Paris. The young gentleman thanked him for
his polite conde&s;cen&s;ion, at which Pallet exulted,
&s;aying with a &s;hake of the head, &startq;I believe &s;o
too, Mon&s;ieur;&endq; and the phy&s;ician, impatient of
the di&s;pute in which he had bore no &s;hare, ob|&s;erved
with a &s;upercilious air, that the modern
&s;tage was altogether beneath the notice of one
who had an idea of ancient magnificence and
execution; that plays ought to be exhibited at
the expence of the &s;tate, as tho&s;e of Sophocles
were by the Athenians; and that proper judges
&s;hould be appointed for receiving or rejecting all
&s;uch performances as are offered to the public.</P>
<P>He then de&s;cribed the theatre at Rome, which
contained eighty thou&s;and &s;pectators, gave them
a learned di&s;qui&s;ition into the nature of the Per|&s;ona,
or ma&s;k, worn by the Roman actors, which,
he &s;aid, was a machine that covered the whole
head, furni&s;hed on the in&s;ide with a brazen con|cavity,
that, by reverberating the &s;ound as it i&s;|&s;ued
from the mouth, rai&s;ed the voice, &s;o as to
render it audible to &s;uch an extended audience.
He explained the difference between the Saltator
and Declamator, one of whom acted, while the
other rehear&s;ed the part; and from thence took
occa&s;ion to mention the perfection of their pan|tomimes,
who were &s;o amazingly di&s;tinct in the
exerci&s;e of their art, that a certain prince of
Pontus being at the court of Nero, and &s;eei$$
one of them repre&s;ent a &s;tory, begged him of t$
emperor, in order to employ him as an interpreter
among barbarous nations, who&s;e language he did
<PB N="144" REF="153">
not under&s;tand. Nay, divers cynic philo&s;ophers,
who had condemned this entertainment un&s;een,
when they chanced to be eye-witne&s;&s;es of their
admirable dexterity, expre&s;&s;ed their &s;orrow for
having &s;o long debarred them&s;elves of &s;uch ra|tional
enjoyment.</P>
<P>He di&s;&s;ented, however, from the opinion of
Peregrine, who, as a proof of their excellence,
had advanced, that &s;ome of the Engli&s;h actors
fancied them&s;elves the very thing they repre&s;ented,
and recounted a &s;tory from Lucian, of a certain
celebrated pantomime, who in acting the part of
Ajax in his frenzy, was tran&s;ported into a real fit
of delirium, during which he tore to-pieces the
cloaths of that actor who &s;talked before him,
beating the &s;tage with iron &s;hoes, in order to in|crea&s;e
the noi&s;e, &s;natched an in&s;trument from
one of the mu&s;icians, and broke it over the head
of him who repre&s;ented Uly&s;&s;es; and running
to the con&s;ular bench, mi&s;took a couple of &s;e|nators
for the &s;heep which were to be &s;lain. The
audience applauded him to the &s;kies; but &s;o con|&s;cious
was the mimic of his own extravagance,
when he recovered the u&s;e of his rea&s;on, that he
actually fell &s;ick with mortification; and being
afterwards de&s;ired to re-act the piece, flatly re|fu&s;ed
to appear in any &s;uch character, &s;aying,
that the &s;horte&s;t follies were the be&s;t, and that it
was &s;ufficient for him to have been a madman
once in his life.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. LVI.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">An adventure happens to Pipes, in con&s;equence of
which he is di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from Peregrine's &s;ervice.
The whole company &s;et out for Ghent in the Di|ligence.
Our hero is captivated by a lady in
that carriage; intere&s;ts her &s;piritual director in
his behalf.</HEAD>
<P>THE doctor being fairly engaged on the &s;ub|ject
of the ancients, would have proceeded
the Lord knows how far, without he&s;itation, had
not he been interrupted by the arrival of Mr.
Jolter, who in great confu&s;ion told them, that
Pipes having affronted a &s;oldier, was then &s;ur|rounded
in the &s;treet, and would certainly be put
to death, if &s;ome per&s;on of authority did not im|mediately
interpo&s;e in his behalf.</P>
<P>Peregrine no &s;ooner learn'd the danger of his
tru&s;ty &s;quire, than &s;natching up his &s;word, he ran
down &s;tairs, and was followed by the Chevalier,
intreating him to leave the affair to his manage|ment.
Within ten yards of the door they found
Tom with his back to a wall, defending him&s;elf
manfully with a mop&s;tick again&s;t the a&s;&s;ault of
three or four &s;oldiers, who at &s;ight of the Malte&s;e
cro&s;s de&s;i&s;ted from the attack, and were taken
into cu&s;tody by order of the knight. One of
the aggre&s;&s;ors being an Iri&s;hman, begged to be
heard with great importunity, before he &s;hould
be &s;ent to the guard; and by the mediation of
Pickle, was accordingly brought into the Hotel,
with his companions, all three bearing upon their
heads and faces evident marks of their adver|&s;ary&rsquo;s
prowe&s;s and dexterity. The &s;poke&s;man
<PB N="146" REF="155">
being confronted with Pipes, informed the com|pany,
that having by accident met with Mr. Pipes,
whom he con&s;idered as his countryman, though
fortune had di&s;po&s;ed of them in different &s;ervices,
he invited him to drink a gla&s;s of wine; and ac|cordingly
carried him to a Cabaret, where he in|troduced
him to his comrades; but in the cour&s;e
of the conver&s;ation, which turned upon the
power and greatne&s;s of the kings of France and
England, Mr. Pipes had been plea&s;ed to treat
his Mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ty with great di&s;re&s;pect;
and when he (the entertainer) expo&s;tulated with
him in a friendly manner about his impolite be|haviour,
ob&s;erving, that he being in the French
&s;ervice, would be under the nece&s;&s;ity of re&s;enting
his abu&s;e, if he did not put a &s;top to it before the
other gentlemen of the cloth &s;hould comprehend
his meaning, he had &s;et them all three at de|fiance,
di&s;honoured him in particular with the
opprobrious epithet of <HI>rebel to his native king and
country,</HI> and even drank (in broken French) to
the perdition of Lewis and all his adherents!
that compelled by this outragious conduct, he,
as the per&s;on who had recommended him to their
&s;ociety, had, in vindication of his own character,
demanded &s;atisfaction of the delinquent, who on
pretence of fetching a &s;word, had gone to his
lodging, from whence he all of a &s;udden &s;allied
upon them with the mop&s;tick, which he em|ployed
in the annoyance of them all without di|&s;tinction,
&s;o that they were obliged to draw in
their own defence.</P>
<P>Pipes being que&s;tioned by his ma&s;ter, with re|gard
to the truth of this account, owned that
every circum&s;tance was ju&s;tly repre&s;ented; &s;ay|ing,
he did not value their chee&s;e-toa&s;ters a pinch
<PB N="147" REF="156">
of oakum; and that if the gentlemen had not
&s;hot in betwixt them, he would have trimmed
them to &s;uch a tune, that they &s;hould not have
had a whole yard to &s;quare. Peregrine repri|manded
him &s;harply for his unmannerly beha|viour,
and in&s;i&s;ted upon his a&s;king pardon of tho&s;e
he had injured, upon the &s;pot. But no con&s;ide|ration
was efficacious enough to produce &s;uch con|ce&s;&s;ion;
to this command he was both deaf and
dumb, and the repeated threats of his ma&s;ter had
no more effect than if they had been addre&s;&s;ed
to a marble &s;tatue. At length, our hero incen&s;ed
at his ob&s;tinacy, &s;tarted up, and would have
cha&s;ti&s;ed him with manual operation, had not he
been prevented by the Chevalier, who found
means to moderate his indignation &s;o far, that he
contented him&s;elf with di&s;mi&s;&s;ing the offender
from his &s;ervice; and after having obtained the
di&s;charge of the pri&s;oners, gave them a Louis to
drink, by way of recompence for the di&s;grace and
damage they had &s;u&s;tained.</P>
<P>The Knight perceiving our young gentleman
very much ruffled at this accident, and reflecting
upon the extraordinary deportment and appear|ance
of his valet, who&s;e hair had by this time
$dopted a grizzled hue, imagined he was &s;ome
favourite dome&s;tic, who had grown grey in the
&s;ervice of his ma&s;ter's family, and that, of con|&s;equence,
he was unea&s;y at the &s;acrifice he had
made. Swayed by this conjecture, he earne&s;tly
&s;ollicited in his behalf; but all he could obtain,
was a promi&s;e of re-admitting him into favour on
the terms already propo&s;ed, or at lea&s;t on condi|tion
that he &s;hould make his acknowledgment to
the Chevalier, for his want of reverence and re|$$$t
for the French monarch.</P>
<P><PB N="148" REF="157">
Upon this conde&s;cen&s;ion, the culprit was called
up &s;tairs, and made acquainted with the mitiga|tion
of his fate; upon which he &s;aid, he would
down on his marrow-bones to his own ma&s;ter,
but would be damn'd before he would a&s;k pardon
of e'er a Frenchman in Chri&s;tendom. Pickle,
exa&s;perated at this blunt declaration, ordered him
out of his pre&s;ence, and charged him never to ap|pear
before his face again; while the officer in
vain employed all his influence and addre&s;s to ap|pea&s;e
his re&s;entment, and about midnight took
his leave, with marks of mortification at his want
of &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>Next day the company agreed to travel through
Flanders in the Diligence, by the advice of Pe|regrine,
who was not without hope of meeting
with &s;ome adventure or amu&s;ement in that car|riage;
and Jolter took care to &s;ecure places for
them all, it being re&s;olved that the valet de
chambre and the doctor's man &s;hould attend the
vehicle on hor&s;eback; and as for the forlorn
Pipes, he was left to reap the fruits of his own
&s;tubborn di&s;po&s;ition, notwith&s;tanding the united
efforts of the whole triumvirate, who endea|voured
to procure his pardon.</P>
<P>Every previous mea&s;ure being thus taken, they
&s;et out from Li&s;le about &s;ix in the morning, and
found them&s;elves in the company of a female ad|venturer,
a very hand&s;ome young lady, a Capuchin,
and a Rotterdam Jew. Our young gentleman
being the fir&s;t of this &s;ociety that entered, &s;ur|veyed
the &s;trangers with an attentive eye, and
&s;eated him&s;elf immediately behind the beautiful
unknown, who at once attracted his attention.
Pallet &s;eeing another lady uninengaged, in imita|tion
of his friend, took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of her neigh|bourhood;
<PB N="149" REF="158">
the phy&s;ician paired with the prie&s;t,
and Jolter &s;at down by the Jew.</P>
<P>The machine had not proceeded many fur|longs,
when Pickle acco&s;ting the fair incognita,
congratulated him&s;elf upon his happine&s;s, in be|ing
the fellow-traveller of &s;o charming a lady.
She, without the lea&s;t re&s;erve or affectation,
thanked him for his compliment, and replied with
a &s;prightly air, that now they were embarked in
one common bottom, they mu&s;t club their en|deavours
to make one another as happy as the
nature of their &s;ituation would permit them to
be. Encouraged by this frank intimation, and
captivated by her fine black eyes and ea&s;y beha|viour,
he attached him&s;elf to her from that mo|ment;
and in a little time the conver&s;ation be|came
&s;o particular, that the Capuchin thought
proper to interfere in the di&s;cour&s;e, in &s;uch a
manner as gave the youth to under&s;tand, that
he was there on purpo&s;e to &s;uperintend her con|duct.
He was doubly rejoiced at this di&s;covery,
in con&s;equence of which he hoped to profit in his
addre&s;&s;es, not only by the young lady's re&s;traint,
that never fails to operate in behalf of the lover,
but al&s;o by the corruptibility of her guardian,
whom he did not doubt of rendering propitious
to his cau&s;e. Flu&s;hed with the&s;e expectations,
he behaved with uncommon complacency to the
father, who was charmed with the affability of
his carriage, and on the faith of his genero&s;ity
abated of his vigilance &s;o much, that our hero
carried on his &s;uit without further mole&s;tation;
while the painter, in &s;igns and loud bur&s;ts of
laughter, conver&s;ed with his Dulcinea, who was
perfectly well ver&s;ed in the&s;e &s;imple expre&s;&s;ions
<PB N="150" REF="159">
of &s;atisfaction, and had already found means to
make a dangerous inva&s;ion upon his heart.</P>
<P>Nor were the governor and phy&s;ician unem|ployed,
while their friends intere&s;ted them&s;elves
in this agreeable manner. Jolter no &s;ooner per|ceived
the Hollander was a Jew, than he entered
into an inve&s;tigation of the Hebrew tongue, in
which he was a connoi&s;&s;eur; and the doctor at
the &s;ame time attacked the Mendicant on the ri|diculous
maxims of his order, together with the
impo&s;itions of prie&s;t-craft in general, which (he
ob&s;erved) prevail &s;o much among tho&s;e who pro|fe&s;s
the Roman Catholic religion.</P>
<P>Thus coupled, each committee enjoyed their
own conver&s;ation apart, without any danger of
encroachment; and all were &s;o intent upon their
&s;everal topics, that they &s;carce allowed them|&s;elves
a &s;mall interval in viewing the de&s;olation of
Menin, as they pa&s;&s;ed through that ruined fron|tier.
About twelve o'clock they arrived at Cour|tray,
where the hor&s;es are always changed, and
the company halt an hour for refre&s;hment. Here
Peregrine handed his charmer into an apartment,
where &s;he was joined by the other lady; and on
pretence of &s;eeing &s;ome of the churches in town,
put him&s;elf under the direction of the Capuchin,
from whom he learn'd, that the young lady was
wife to a French gentleman, to whom &s;he had
been married about a year, and that &s;he was now
on her journey to vi&s;it her mother, who lived in
Bru&s;&s;els, and who at that time laboured under a
lingering di&s;temper, which, in all probability,
would &s;oon put a period to her life. He then
launched out in prai&s;e of her daughter's virtue
and conjugal affection; and la&s;tly told him, that
he was her father confe&s;&s;or, and pitched upon to
<PB N="151" REF="160">
be her conductor through Flanders, by her hu&s;|band,
who, as well as his wife, placed the ut|mo&s;t
confidence in his prudence and integrity.</P>
<P>Pickle ea&s;ily comprehended the meaning of
this in&s;inuation, and took the hint accordingly.
He tickled the prie&s;t's vanity with extraordinary
encomiums upon the di&s;intere&s;ted principles of his
order, which were detached from all worldly pur|&s;uits,
and altogether devoted to the eternal &s;al|vation
of mankind. He applauded their patience,
humility and learning, and lavi&s;hed a world of
prai&s;e upon their talent in preaching, which (he
&s;aid) had more than once operated &s;o powerfully
upon him, that had he not been re&s;trained by
certain con&s;iderations which he could not po&s;&s;ibly
wave, he &s;hould have embraced their tenets, and
begg'd admi&s;&s;ion into their fraternity; but, as the
circum&s;tances of his fate would not permit him
to take &s;uch a &s;alutary mea&s;ure for the pre&s;ent,
he intreated the good father to accept a &s;mall to|ken
of his love and re&s;pect, for the benefit of
that convent to which he belonged. So &s;aying,
he pulled out a pur&s;e of ten guineas, which the
Capuchin ob&s;erving, turned his head another way,
and lifting up his arm, di&s;played a pocket almo&s;t
as high as his collar-bone, in which he depo&s;ited
the money.</P>
<P>This proof of affection for the order produced
a &s;udden and &s;urpri&s;ing effect upon the friar. In
the tran&s;port of his zeal he wrung this &s;emi-con|vert's
hand, &s;howered a thou&s;and benedictions
upon his head, and exhorted him, with the tears
flowing from his eyes, to perfect the great work
which the finger of God had begun in his heart;
and as an in&s;tance of his concern for the welfare
of his precious &s;oul, the holy brother promi&s;ed to
<PB N="152" REF="161">
recommend him &s;trenuou&s;ly to the pious admoni|tions
of the young woman under his care, who
was a perfect &s;aint upon earth, and endued with
the peculiar gift&punc; of mollifying the hearts of ob|durate
&s;inners. &startq;O father! (cried the hypocri|tical
projector, who by this time perceived that
his money was not thrown away) if I could be
favoured but for one half hour with the private
in&s;tructions of that in&s;pired devotee, my mind
pre&s;ages, that I &s;hould be a &s;tray'd &s;heep brought
back into the &s;old, and that I &s;hould find ea&s;y en|trance
at the gates of heaven! There is &s;ome|thing
&s;upernatural in her a&s;pect; I gaze upon her
with the mo&s;t pious &s;ervor, and my whole &s;oul
is agitated with tumults of hope and de&s;pair!&endq;
Having pronounced this rhap&s;ody with tran&s;port
half natural and half affected, the prie&s;t a&s;&s;ured
him, that the&s;e were operations of the &s;pirit,
which mu&s;t not be repre&s;&s;ed; and comforted him
with the hope of enjoying the ble&s;&s;ed interview
which he de&s;ired, prote&s;ting, that as far as his
influence extended, his wi&s;h &s;hould be that very
evening indulged. The gracious pupil thanked
him for his benevolent concern, which he &s;wore
&s;hould not be &s;quandered upon an ungrateful ob|ject;
and the re&s;t of the company interrupting
the conver&s;ation, they returned in a body to the
inn, where they dined all together; and the ladies
were per&s;uaded to be our hero's gue&s;ts.</P>
<P>As the &s;ubjects on which they had been en|gaged
before dinner were not exhau&s;ted, each
brace re&s;umed their former theme, when they
were replaced in the Diligence. The painter's
mi&s;tre&s;s fini&s;hed her conque&s;t, by exerting her
&s;kill in the art of ogling, accompanied by fre|quent
bewitching &s;ighs, and &s;ome tender French
<PB N="153" REF="162">
&s;ongs that &s;he &s;ung with &s;uch pathetic expre&s;|&s;ion,
as quite melted the re&s;olution of Pallet, and
utterly &s;ubdued his affection: and he, to convince
her of the importance of her victory, gave a &s;pe|cimen
of his own talents, by entertaining her
with that celebrated Engli&s;h ditty, the burthen
of which begins with, <HI>The pigs they lie with their
ar&s;es bare.</HI></P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">He makes &s;ome progre&s;s in her affections; is in|terrupted

appea&s;es the wrath of the Capuchin, who pre|cures
for him an interview with his fair en|&s;laver,
in which he finds him&s;elf deceived.</HEAD>
<P>PEregrine, mean while, employed all his in|&s;inuation
and addre&s;s in practi&s;ing upon the
heart of the Capuchin's fair charge. He had long
ago declared his pa&s;&s;ion, not in the &s;uperficial
manner of a French gallant, but with all the
ardor of an enthu&s;ia&s;t. He had langui&s;hed, vow'd,
flattered, ki&s;s'd her hand by &s;tealth, and had no
rea&s;on to complain of his reception. Though
by a man of a le&s;s &s;anguine di&s;po&s;ition, her par|ticular
complai&s;ance would have been deemed
equivocal, and perhaps nothing more than the ef|fect
of French breeding and con&s;titutional vi|vacity;
he gave his own qualifications credit for
the whole, and with the&s;e &s;entiments carried on
the attack with &s;uch unabating vigour, that &s;he
was actually prevailed upon to accept a ring,
which he pre&s;ented as a token of his e&s;teem; and
every thing proceeded in a mo&s;t pro&s;perous train,
when they were di&s;turbed by the governor and
<PB N="154" REF="163">
I&s;raelite, who in the heat of di&s;putation rai&s;ed
their voices, and poured forth &s;uch effu&s;ions of
gutturals, as &s;et our lover's teeth on edge. As
they &s;poke in a language unknown to every one
in the carriage but them&s;elves, and looked at
each other with mutual animo&s;ity and rancour,
Peregrine de&s;ired to know the cau&s;e of their con|tention.
Upon which, Jolter exclaimed in a fu|rious
tone, &startq;This learned Levite, for&s;ooth, has
the impudence to tell me, that I don't under&s;tand
Hebrew; and affirms, that the word <HI>Benoni</HI> &s;ig|nifies
<HI>child of joy;</HI> whereas I can prove, and in|deed
have already &s;aid enough to convince any
rea&s;onable man, that in the Septuagint it is rightly
tran&s;lated into <HI>&s;on of my &s;orrow.</HI> Having thus
explained him&s;elf to his pupil, he turned to the
prie&s;t, with intention to appeal to his determina|tion;
but the Jew pulled him by the &s;leeve with
great eagerne&s;s, &s;aying, &startq;For the love of God
be quiet, the Capuchin will di&s;cover who we are!&endq;
Jolter, offended at this conjunction, ecchoed
&startq;Who we are!&endq; with great empha&s;is; and re|peating
<HI>nos poma natamus,</HI> a&s;ked ironically, to
which of the Tribes the Jew thought he belonged?
The Levite, affronted at his comparing him to a
ball of hor&s;e-dung, replied with a mo&s;t &s;ignifi|cant
grin, &startq;To the tribe of I&s;&s;achar.&endq; And
his antagoni&s;t, taking the advantage of his un|willingne&s;s
to be known by the friar, and prompted
by revenge for the freedom he had u&s;ed, an|&s;wered
in the French language, that the judg|ment
of God was &s;till manife&s;t upon their whole
race, not only in their being in the &s;tate of exiles
from their native land, but al&s;o in the &s;pite of
their hearts and pravity of their di&s;po&s;itions,
which demon&s;trate them to be the genuine off|&s;pring
<PB N="155" REF="164">
of tho&s;e who crucified the Saviour of the
world.</P>
<P>His expectation was, however, defeated; the
prie&s;t him&s;elf was too deeply engaged, to attend
to the debates of other people. The phy&s;ician,
in the pride and in&s;olence of his learning, had
undertaken to di&s;play the ab&s;urdity of the Chri|&s;tian
faith; having already (as he thought) con|futed
the Capuchin, touching the points of belief
in which the Roman Catholics differ from the re&s;t
of the world. But, not contented with the ima|gined
victory he had gained, he began to &s;trike
at the fundamentals of religion; and the father,
with incredible forbearance, &s;uffered him to make
very free with the doctrine of the Trinity: but,
when he levelled the &s;hafts of his ridicule at the
immaculate conception of the Ble&s;&s;ed Virgin, the
good man's patience for&s;ook him, his eyes &s;eemed
to kindle with indignation, he trembled in every
joint, and uttered with a loud voice, &startq;You are
an abominable&mdash;I will not call thee heretic,
for thou art wor&s;e (if po&s;&s;ible) than a Jew; you
de&s;erve to be inclo&s;ed in a furnace &s;even times
heated, and I have a good mind to lodge an in|formation
again&s;t you with the governor of
Ghent, that you may be apprehended and pu|ni&s;hed
as an impious bla&s;phemer.&endq;</P>
<P>This menace operated like a charm upon all
pre&s;ent. The doctor was confounded, the go|vernor
di&s;mayed, the Levite's teeth chattered,
the painter was a&s;toni&s;hed at the general confu|&s;ion,
the cau&s;e of which he could not compre|hend;

for the young gentleman, con&s;ented to for|give
what had pa&s;&s;ed, but ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed to fit
in contact with &s;uch a profane wretch, whom he
looked upon as a fiend of darkne&s;s, &s;ent by the
enemy of mankind to poi&s;on the minds of weak
people; &s;o that, after having cro&s;&s;ed him&s;elf,
and muttered certain exorci&s;ms, he in&s;i&s;ted upon
the doctor's changing places with the Jew, who
approached the offended eccle&s;ia&s;tic in an agony
of fear.</P>
<P>Matters being thus compromi&s;ed, the conver|&s;ation
flowed in a more general channel; and
without the intervention of any other accident,
or bone of contention, the carriage arrived at the
city of Ghent about &s;even in the evening; and
&s;upper being be&s;poke for the whole company, our
adventurer and his friends went out to take a &s;u|perficial
view of the place, leaving his new mi|&s;tre&s;s
to the pious exhortations of her confe&s;&s;or,
whom (as we have already ob&s;erved) he had &s;e|cured
in his intere&s;t. This zealous mediator
&s;poke &s;o warmly in his commendation, and in|tere&s;ted
her con&s;cience &s;o much in the affair, that
&s;he could not refu&s;e her helping hand to the great
work of his conver&s;ion, and promi&s;ed to grant
the interview he de&s;ired.</P>
<P>This agreeable piece of intelligence, which
the Capuchin communicated to Peregrine at his
return, elevated his &s;pirits to &s;uch a degree, that
he &s;hone at &s;upper with uncommon brilliance, in
a thou&s;and &s;allies of wit and plea&s;antry, to the
admiration and delight of all pre&s;ent, e&s;pecially
of his fair Fleming, who &s;eemed quite captivated
by his per&s;on and behaviour.</P>
<P>The evening being thus &s;pent to the &s;atisfac|tion
of all parties, the company broke up, and
<PB N="157" REF="166">
retired to their &s;everal apartments, when our lover,
to his un&s;peakable mortification, learnt that the
two ladies were obliged to lie in the &s;ame room,
all the other chambers of the inn being preoccu|pied.
When he imparted this difficulty to the prie&s;t,
that charitable father, who was very fruitful in
expedients, a&s;&s;ured him, that his &s;piritual con|cerns
&s;hould not be ob&s;tructed by &s;uch a &s;lender
impediment; and accordingly availed him&s;elf of
his prerogative, by going into his daughter's
chamber when &s;he was almo&s;t undre&s;&s;ed, and
leading her into his own, on pretence of admi|ni&s;tring
&s;alutary food for her &s;oul. Having
brought the two votaries together, he prayed for
&s;ucce&s;s to the operations of grace, and left them
to their mutual meditations, after having conjured
them in the mo&s;t &s;olemn manner to let no im|pure
&s;entiments, or temptations of the fle&s;h, in|terfere
with the hallowed de&s;ign of their meeting.</P>
<P>The reverend interce&s;&s;or being gone, and the
door fa&s;tened on the in&s;ide, the p&s;eudo-convert,
tran&s;ported with his pa&s;&s;ion, threw him&s;elf at his
Amanda's feet; and begging &s;he would &s;pare him
the tedious form of addre&s;&s;es, which the nature
of their interview would not permit him to ob|&s;erve,
began with all the impetuo&s;ity of love to
profit by the occa&s;ion. But, whether &s;he was
di&s;plea&s;ed at the intrepidity and a&s;&s;urance of his
behaviour, thinking her&s;elf intitled to more court|&s;hip
and re&s;pect, or was really better fortified
with cha&s;tity than he or his procurer had &s;up|po&s;ed
her to be; certain it is, &s;he expre&s;&s;ed re|&s;entment
and &s;urprize at his boldne&s;s and pre|&s;umption,
and upbraided him with having im|po&s;ed
upon the charity of the friar. The young
gentleman was really as much a&s;toni&s;hed at this
<PB N="158" REF="167">
rebuff, as &s;he pretended to be at his declaration,
and earne&s;tly intreated her to con&s;ider how pre|cious
the moments were, and for once &s;acrifice
&s;uperfluous ceremony, to the happine&s;s of one
who adored her with &s;uch a flame, as could not
fail to con&s;ume his vitals, if &s;he would not deign
to ble&s;s him with her favour. Yet, notwith&s;tand|ing
all his tears, vows and &s;upplications, his per|&s;onal
accompli&s;hments and the tempting oppor|tunity,
all that he could obtain, was an acknow|ledgment
of his having made an impre&s;&s;ion upon
her heart, which &s;he hoped the dictates of her
duty would enable her to era&s;e. This confe&s;&s;ion
he con&s;idered as a delicate con&s;ent; and obeying
the impul&s;e of his love, &s;natched her up in his
arms, with intention of &s;eizing that which &s;he
declined to give; when this French Lucretia,
unable to defend her virtue any other way,
&s;creamed aloud; and the Capuchin, &s;etting his
&s;houlder to the door, bur&s;t it open, and entered
in an affected exta&s;y of amazement. He lifted
up his hands and eyes, and pretended to be thun|der&s;truck
at the di&s;covery he had made; then, in
broken exclamations, profe&s;&s;ed his horror at the
wicked intention of our hero, who had covered
&s;uch a damnable &s;cheme with the ma&s;k of religion.
In &s;hort, he performed his cue with &s;uch dexte|rity,
that the lady believing him in earne&s;t,
begg'd he would forgive the &s;tranger, on account
of his youth and education, which had been tainted
by the errors of here&s;y; and he was on the&s;e
con&s;iderations content to accept the &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion of
our hero, who, far from renouncing his expec|tations,
notwith&s;tanding this mortifying repul&s;e,
confided &s;o much in his own talents, and the con|fe&s;&s;ion
which his mi&s;tre&s;s had made, that he re|&s;olved

<HEAD TYPE="sub">He makes another effort towards the accompli&s;hment
of his wi&s;h, which is po&s;tponed by a &s;trange ac|cident.</HEAD>
<P>HE directed his valet de chambre, who was
a thorough-paced pimp, to kindle &s;ome
&s;traw in the yard, and then pa&s;s by the door of
her apartment, crying with a loud voice that the
hou&s;e was on fire. This alarm brought both la|dies
out of their chamber in a moment, and Pe|regrine
taking the advantage of their running to
the &s;treet door, entered the room and concealed
him&s;elf under a large table that &s;tood in an unob|&s;erved
corner. The nymphs, as &s;oon as they
under&s;tood the cau&s;e of his Mercury's &s;uppo&s;ed
affright, returned to their apartment, and having
&s;aid their prayers, undre&s;&s;ed them&s;elves and went
to bed. This &s;cene, which fell under the ob&s;er|vation
of Pickle, did not at all contribute to the
cooling of his concupi&s;cence, but on the contrary,
inflamed him to &s;uch a degree, that he could
&s;carce re&s;train his impatience, until by her &s;nor|ing,
he concluded the fellow-lodger of his Amanda
was a&s;leep. This welcome note no &s;ooner &s;a|lu$ed
his ears, than he crept to his charmer's bed|&s;ide,
and placing him&s;elf on his knees, gently laid
hold on her white hand, and pre&s;&s;ed it to his lips.
She had ju&s;t begun to clo&s;e her eyes, and enjoy
the agreeable oppre&s;&s;ion of &s;lumber, when &s;he
was rou&s;ed by this rape, at which &s;he &s;tarted,
<PB N="160" REF="169">
pronouncing in a tone of &s;urprize and di&s;may,
&startq;My God! who's that?&endq; The lover, with the
mo&s;t in&s;inuating humility, be&s;ought her to hear
him; vowing that his intention in approaching
her thus, was not to violate the laws of decency,
or that indelible e&s;teem which &s;he had engraven
on his heart; but to manife&s;t his &s;orrow and
contrition for the umbrage he had given, to pour
forth the overflowings of his &s;oul, and tell her
that he neither could nor would &s;urvive her di&s;|plea&s;ure.
The&s;e and many more pathetic pro|te&s;tations,
accompanied with &s;ighs and tears, and
other expre&s;&s;ions of genuine grief, which our
hero had at command, could not fail to melt the
tender heart of the amiable Fleming, already pre|po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed
in favour of his qualifications. She &s;ym|pathized
&s;o much with his affliction, as to weep
in her turn, when &s;he repre&s;ented the impo&s;&s;ibi|lity
of her rewarding his pa&s;&s;ion; and he &s;eizing
the favourable moment, reinforced his &s;ollicita|tions
with &s;uch irre&s;i&s;tible tran&s;ports, that her re|&s;olution
gave way, &s;he began to breathe quick and
deep, expre&s;&s;ed her fear of being overheard by
the other lady, and with an ejaculation of &startq;O
heavens! I'm undone:&endq; &s;uffered her&s;elf, after a
faint &s;truggle, to be overpowered by her admirer,
who made a lodgment upon the covered way of
her bed, under the curtain of the counter&s;carp;
and in all probability, would have in a few mo|ments
made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of the place; when
her honour was &s;ecured for the pre&s;ent, by a
&s;trange &s;ort of knocking upon the wain&s;cot, at
the other end of the room, hard by the bed in
which the female adventurer lay. Surpri&s;ed at
this circum&s;tance which interrupted our a&s;&s;ailant's
operations, the lady begged him for heaven's &s;ake to
<PB N="161" REF="170">
retreat, el&s;e her reputation would be ruined for
$ver: but when he repre&s;ented to her, that her
character would run a much greater ri&s;k, if he
&s;hould be detected in withdrawing, &s;he con&s;ented
with great trepidation to his &s;tay, and they li&s;tened
in &s;ilence to the &s;equel of the noi&s;e that alarmed
them. This was no other than an expedient of
the painter, to awaken his Dulcinea, with whom
he had made an a&s;&s;ignation, or at lea&s;t inter|changed
&s;uch &s;ignals as he thought amounted to a
firm appointment. His nymph being di&s;turbed
in her fir&s;t &s;leep, immediately under&s;tood the
&s;ound, and true to the agreement, ro&s;e, and un|bolting
the door as &s;oftly as po&s;&s;ible, gave him
admittance, leaving it open for his more commo|dious
retreat.</P>
<P>While this happy gallant was employed in di&s;|engaging
him&s;elf from the di&s;habille in which he
had entered, the Capuchin &s;u&s;pecting that Pere|grine
would make another attempt upon his
charge, had crept &s;ilently to the apartment, in
order to reconnoitre, le&s;t the adventure &s;hould be
atchieved without his knowledge; a circum&s;tance
that would deprive him of the profits he might
expect from his privity and concurrence. Finding
the door unlatched, his &s;u&s;picion was confirmed,
and he made no &s;cruple of creeping into the
chamber on all-four; &s;o that the painter having
&s;tript him&s;elf to the &s;hirt, in groping about for
his Dulcinea's bed, chanced to lay his hand upon
the &s;haven crown of the father's head, which by
a circular motion, the prie&s;t began to turn round
in his gra&s;p, like a ball in a &s;ocket, to the &s;ur|prize
and con&s;ternation of poor Pallet, who hav|ing
neither penetration to comprehend the ca&s;e,
nor re&s;olution to withdraw his fingers from this
<PB N="162" REF="171">
&s;trange object of his touch, &s;tood &s;weating in the
dark, and vented ejaculations with great devotion,
till the friar tired with this exerci&s;e, and the pain|ful
po&s;ture in which he &s;tooped, rai&s;ed him&s;elf
gradually upon his feet, heaving up at the &s;ame
time the hand of the painter, who&s;e terror and
amazement increa&s;ed to &s;uch a degree at this un|accountable
elevation, that his faculties began to
fail; and his palm in the confu&s;ion of his fright
&s;liding over the prie&s;t's forehead, one of his fin|gers
happened to &s;lip into his mouth, and was
immediately &s;ecured between the Capuchin's teeth,
with as firm a fixure, as if it had been &s;crewed in
a black&s;mith's vice. The painter was &s;o much
di&s;ordered by this &s;udden &s;nap, which tortured him
to the bone, that forgetting all other con&s;idera|tions,
he roared aloud, &startq;Murder! fire! a trap,
a trap! help, chri&s;tians, for the love of God help!&endq;
Our hero confounded by the&s;e exclamations,
which he knew would &s;oon fill the room with
&s;pectators, and incen&s;ed at his own mortifying
di&s;appointment, was obliged to quit the unta&s;ted
banquet, and approaching the cau&s;e of his mis|fortune,
ju&s;t as his tormentor had thought proper
to relea&s;e his finger, di&s;charged &s;uch a hearty &s;lap
between his &s;houlders, as brought him to the
ground with hideous bellowing, then retiring un|perceived,
to his own chamber, was one of the
fir&s;t who returned with a light, on pretence of
having been alarmed with his cries. The Ca|puchin
had taken the &s;ame precaution, and fol|lowed
Peregrine into the room, pronouncing <HI>Be|nedicite,</HI>
and cro&s;&s;ing him&s;elf with many marks
of a&s;toni&s;hment; and the phy&s;ician and Jolter
appearing at the &s;ame time, the unfortunate
painter was found lying naked on the floor, in
<PB N="163" REF="172">
all the agony of horror and di&s;may, blowing up|on
his left hand, that hung dangling from the el|bow,
like a boy who had burnt his fingers, in
attempting to &s;natch roa&s;ted che&s;nuts from the
fire. The circum&s;tance of his being found in
that apartment, and the attitude of his affliction,
which was extremely ridiculous, provoked the
doctor to a &s;mile, and produced a &s;mall relaxa|tion
in the &s;everity of the governor's counte|nance;
while Pickle, te&s;tifying &s;urprize and con|cern,
lifted him from the ground, and enquired
into the cau&s;e of his pre&s;ent &s;ituation. Having,
after &s;ome recollection, and fruitle&s;s endeavours
to &s;peak, recovered the u&s;e of his tongue, he
told them that the hou&s;e was certainly haunted
by evil &s;pirits, by which he had been conveyed
(he knew not how) into that apartment, and
afflicted with all the tortures of hell; that one
of them had made it&s;elf &s;en&s;ible to his feeling, in
the &s;hape of a round ball of &s;mooth fle&s;h, that
turned round under his hand, like an a&s;trono|mer's
globe, and then ri&s;ing up to a &s;urpri&s;ing
height, was converted into a machine that laid
hold on his finger, by a &s;nap, and having pinned
him to the &s;pot, he continued for &s;ome moments
in un&s;peakable agony, till at la&s;t the engine &s;eem|ed
to melt away from his finger, and he received
a &s;udden thwack upon his &s;houlders, as if di&s;|charged
by the arm of a giant, which overthrew
him in an in&s;tant upon the floor. The prie&s;t
hearing this &s;trange account, pulled out of one
of his pouches a piece of con&s;ecrated candle,
which he lighted immediately, and muttered cer|tain
my&s;terious conjurations. Jolter, imagining
that Pallet was drunk, &s;hook his head, &s;aying,
he believed the &s;pirit was no where but in his
<PB N="164" REF="173">
own brain. The phy&s;ician, for o$ce, conde|&s;cended
to be a wag, and looking towards one of
the beds, ob&s;erved, that in his opinion, the
painter had been mi&s;led by the fle&s;h, and not by
the &s;pirit. The fair Fleming lay in &s;ilent a&s;to|ni&s;hment
and affright; and her fellow-lodger, in
order to acquit her&s;elf of all &s;u&s;picion, exclaimed
with incredible volubility, again&s;t the author of
this uproar, who (&s;he did not doubt) had con|cealed
him&s;elf in the apartment, with a view of
perpetrating &s;ome wicked attempt upon her pre|cious
virtue, and was puni&s;hed and prevented by
the immediate interpo&s;ition of heaven. At her de|&s;ire,
therefore, and the earne&s;t &s;ollicitation of the
other lady, he was conducted to his own bed,
and the chamber being evacuated, they locked
their door, fully re&s;olved to admit no more vi&s;i|tants
for that night: while Peregrine, mad with
&s;eeing the delicious mor&s;el, &s;natched (as it were)
from his very lip, &s;talked through the pa&s;&s;age,
like a gho&s;t, in hopes of finding &s;ome opportu|nity
of re-entering, till the day beginning to
break, he was obliged to retire, cur&s;ing the ideo|tical
conduct of the painter, which had &s;o un|luckily
interfered with his delight.</P>

<P>NEXT day, about one o'clock, after hav|ing

took their departure from Ghent, in the &s;ame

unhappy &s;ufferers, who (as &s;he had been inform|ed)
had fallen victims to the malice of the accu|&s;er.

the acknowledgment &s;he owed to providence,
for having protected her, la&s;t night, from the
wicked aims of unbridled lu&s;t. This ob&s;ervation

reach the ears of his wife. Indeed, though we

every individual in the diligence; becau&s;e the
part which was acted by the Capuchin, was
known to him&s;elf alone; and even he was ut|terly
ignorant of Pickle's being concerned in the
affair; &s;o that the greate&s;t &s;hare of the painter's
&s;ufferings were &s;uppo&s;ed to be the exaggerations
of his own extravagant imagination.</P>
<P>In the mid&s;t of their di&s;cour&s;e on this extraor|dinary
&s;ubject, the driver told them, that they
were now on the very &s;pot where a detachment
of the allied army had been intercepted and cut
off by the French; and &s;topping the vehicle, en|tertained
them with a local de&s;cription of the
battle of Melle. Upon this occa&s;ion, the Flemi&s;h
lady, who &s;ince her marriage had become a keen
partizan for the French, gave a minute detail of
all the circum&s;tances, as they had been repre|&s;ented
to her by her hu&s;band's brother, who was
in the action; and this account, which &s;unk the
number of the French to &s;ixteen, and rai&s;ed that
of the allies to twenty thou&s;and men, was &s;o di&s;|agreeable
to truth, as well as to the laudable
partiality of Peregrine, that he ventured to con|tradict
her a&s;&s;ertions, and a fierce di&s;pute com|menced,
that not only regarded the pre&s;ent que|&s;tion,
but al&s;o comprehended all the battles in
which the duke of Marlborough had commanded
again&s;t Lewis the fourteenth. In the cour&s;e of
the&s;e debates, &s;he dive&s;ted that great general of
all the glory he had acquired, by affirming, that
every victory he gained, was purpo&s;ely lo&s;t by
the French generals, in order to bring the &s;chemes
of madam de Maintenon into di&s;credit; and as a
<PB N="167" REF="176">
particular in&s;tance, alledged that while the citadel
of Li&s;le was be&s;ieged, Lewis &s;aid, in pre&s;ence of
the Dauphin, that if the allies &s;hould be obliged to
rai&s;e the &s;iege, he would immediately declare his
marriage with that lady; upon which, the &s;on
&s;ent private orders to mar&s;hal Boufflers to &s;urren|der
the place. This &s;trange allegation was &s;up|ported
by the a&s;&s;everations of the prie&s;t and the
courtezan, and admitted as truth by the gover|nor,
who pretended to have heard it from good
authority: while the doctor &s;at neutral, as one
who thought it &s;candalous to know the hi&s;tory of
&s;uch modern events; and the I&s;raelite, being a
true Dutchman, li&s;ted him&s;elf under the banners
of our hero, who in attempting to demon&s;trate
the ab&s;urdity and improbability of what they had
advanced, rai&s;ed &s;uch a hue and cry again&s;t him|&s;elf,
and being in&s;en&s;ibly heated in the alterca|tion,
irritated his Amanda to &s;uch a degree, that
her charming eyes kindled with fury, and he &s;aw
great rea&s;on to think, that if he did not fall upon
&s;ome method to deprecate her wrath, &s;he would
in a twinkling &s;acrifice all her e&s;teem for him,
to her own zeal for the glory of the French na|tion.
Swayed by this apprehen&s;ion, his ardour
cooled by degrees, and he in&s;en&s;ibly detached
him&s;elf from the argument, leaving the whole
care of &s;upporting it on the Jew, who finding
him&s;elf de&s;erted, was fain to yeild at di&s;cretion;
&s;o that the French remained ma&s;ters of the field,
and their young heroine re&s;umed her good hu|mour.
And let the circum&s;tances of this conten|tion

pre&s;ents, and the di&s;appointment he had already
undergone, before they &s;hould reach that city:
on pretence of enjoying a freer air, he mounted
the box, and employed his elocution and gene|ro&s;ity
with &s;uch &s;ucce&s;s, that the driver under|took
to di&s;able the Diligence from proceeding
beyond the town of Alo&s;t for that day; and in
con&s;equence of his promi&s;e, gently overturned it,
when they were about a mile &s;hort of that bait|ing
place. He had taken his mea&s;ures &s;o di&s;|creetly,
that this accident was attended with no
other inconvenience than a fit of fear, that took
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the ladies, and the nece&s;&s;ity to which
they were reduced, by the declaration of the
coachman, who, upon examining the carriage,
a&s;&s;ured the company that the axle-tree had given
way, and advi&s;ed them to walk forward to the
inn, while he would jog after them at a &s;low
pace, and do his endeavour that the damage
&s;hould be immediately repaired. Peregrine pre|tended
to be very much concerned at what had
happened, and even cur&s;ed the driver for his in|advertency,
expre&s;&s;ing infinite impatience to be
<PB N="169" REF="178">
at Bru&s;&s;els, and wi&s;hing that this misfortune
might not detain them another night upon the
road; but when his under&s;tapper, according to
his in&s;tructions, came afterwards to the inn, and
gave them to under&s;tand, that the workman he
had employed, could not po&s;&s;ibly refit the ma|chine
in le&s;s than &s;ix hours, the crafty youth af|fected
to lo&s;e all temper, &s;tormed at his emi&s;|&s;ary,
whom he reviled in the mo&s;t opprobious
terms, and threatened to cane for his mi&s;conduct.
The fellow prote&s;ted, with great humility, that
their being overturned was owing to the failure
of the axle-tree, and not to his want of care or
dexterity in driving; though rather than be
thought the cau&s;e of incommoding him, he would
inquire for a po&s;t-chai&s;e, in which he might de|part
for Bru&s;&s;els immediately. This expedient
Pi$kle rejected, unle&s;s the whole company could
be accommodated in the &s;ame manner; and he
had been previou&s;ly informed by the driver, that
the town could not furni&s;h more than one ve|hicle
of that $word$. His governor, who was quite
ign$rant of his &s;cheme, repre&s;ented that one
night would &s;oon be pa&s;&s;ed, and exhorted him to
bear this &s;mall di&s;appointment with a good grace,
e&s;pecially as the hou&s;e &s;eemed to be well pro|vi$ed
for their entertainment, and the company
&s;o much di&s;po&s;ed to be &s;ociable. The Capuchin,
who had found his account in cultivating the ac|quaintance
of the young &s;tranger, was not ill-plea&s;ed
at this event, which might, by protract|ing
the term of their intercour&s;e, yield him &s;ome
opportunity of profiting &s;till further by his libe|ra$$ty:
he therefore joined Mr. Jolter in his ad|monitions,
congratulating him&s;elf upon the pro|ject
of enjoying his conver&s;ation a little longer
<PB N="170" REF="179">
than he had expected; and our young gentleman
received a compliment to the &s;ame purpo&s;e from
the Hebrew, who had that day exerci&s;ed his gal|lantry
upon the French coquette, and was not
without hope of reaping the fruits of his atten|tion,
his rival, the painter, being quite di&s;graced
and dejected by the adventure of la&s;t night. As
for the doctor, he was too much engro&s;&s;ed in the
contemplation of his own importance, to intere&s;t
him&s;elf in the affair, or its con&s;equences, further
than by ob&s;erving, that the European powers
ought to e&s;tabli&s;h public games, like tho&s;e that
were celebrated of old in Greece; in which ca&s;e,
every &s;tate would be &s;upplied with &s;uch dextrous
charioteers, as could drive a machine at full
&s;peed, within a hair's breadth of a precipice, with|out
any danger of its being overthrown. Peregrine
could not help yielding to their remon&s;trances,
and united complai&s;ance, for which he thanked
them in very polite terms, and his pa&s;&s;ion &s;eem|ing
to &s;ub&s;ide, propo&s;ed that they &s;hould amu&s;e
them&s;elves in walking round the ramparts, with
a view of enjoying &s;ome private conver&s;ation
with his admired Fleming, who had this whole
day behaved with remarkable re&s;erve. The
propo&s;al being embraced, he (as u&s;ual) handed
her into the &s;treet, and took all opportunities of
promoting his &s;uit; but they were attended &s;o
clo&s;ely by her father confe&s;&s;or, that he fore&s;aw it
would be impracticable to accompli&s;h his aim,
without the connivance of that eccle&s;ia&s;tick,
which he was obliged to purcha&s;e with another
pur&s;e, that he offered, and was accepted as a
charitable atonement for his criminal behaviour
during the interview which the friar had pro|cured
for the good of his &s;oul. This benefaction
<PB N="171" REF="180">
was no &s;ooner made, than the pious mendicant
edged off by little and little, till he joined the
re&s;t of the company, leaving his generous patron
at full liberty to pro&s;ecute his purpo&s;e. It is not
to be doubted that our adventurer made a good
u&s;e of this occa&s;ion: he practi&s;ed a thou&s;and
flowers of rhetoric, and actually exhau&s;ted his
whole addre&s;s, in per&s;uading her to have com|pa&s;&s;ion
upon his mi&s;ery, and indulge him with
another private audience, without which he
&s;hould run di&s;tracted, and be guilty of extrava|gancies,
which, in the humanity of her di&s;po&s;i|tion,
&s;he would weep to &s;ee. But, in&s;tead of
complying with his reque&s;t, &s;he chid him &s;everely
for his pre&s;umption, in per&s;ecuting her with his
vicious addre&s;&s;es; and a&s;&s;ured him, that although
&s;he had &s;ecured a chamber for her&s;elf in this
place, becau&s;e &s;he had no ambition to be better
acquainted with the other lady, he would be in
the wrong to di&s;turb her with another nocturnal
vi&s;it; for &s;he was determined to deny him ad|mittance.
The lover was comforted by this
$int, which he under&s;tood in the true accepta|tion,
and his pa&s;&s;ion being inflamed by the ob&s;ta|cles
he had met with in this intrigue, his heart
beat high with the pro&s;pect of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. The&s;e
raptures of expectation produced an inquietude,
which di&s;abled him from bearing that &s;hare of
the conver&s;ation for which he u&s;ed to be di&s;tin|gui&s;hed.
His behaviour at &s;upper was a vici&s;&s;i|tude
of &s;tartings, and reveries; and the Capu|c$an
imputing this di&s;order to a &s;econd repul&s;e
from his charge, began to be invaded with the
apprehen&s;ion of being obliged to refund, and in
a whi&s;per forbad our hero to de&s;pair.</P>

which he con&s;idered as an in&s;ult upon his
misfortune, as well as an evident preference of
his rival: and, con&s;cious of his own timidity,
&s;wallowed an extraordinary gla&s;s, that his inven|tion

to his friend Peregrine, and begged the a&s;|&s;i&s;tance

was too intent upon his own affair, to
mind the concerns of any other per&s;on, and he
declining to be engaged in the project, Pallet had
recour&s;e to the genius of Pickle's valet de cham|bre,
<PB N="173" REF="182">
who readily embarked in the undertaking,
and invented a plan, which was executed accord|ingly.</P>
<P>The evening being pretty far advanced, and
the company &s;eparated into their re&s;pective apart|ments,
Pickle repaired, in all the impatience of
youth and de&s;ire, to the chamber of his charmer,
and finding the door unbolted, entered in a
tran&s;port of joy. By the light of the moon,
which &s;hone through the window, he was con|dected
to her bed, which he approached in the
utmo&s;t agitation, and perceiving her to all ap|pearance
a&s;leep, e&s;&s;ayed to wake her with a
gentle ki&s;s; but this method proved ineffectual,
becau&s;e &s;he was determined to &s;ave her&s;elf the
confu&s;ion of being an accomplice in his guilt.
He repeated the application, murmured a mo&s;t
$word$ &s;alutation in her ear, and took &s;uch
other gentle methods of &s;ignifying his pre&s;ence,
as per&s;uaded him that &s;he was re&s;olved to &s;leep,
in &s;pite of all his endeavours: flu&s;hed with this
agreeable &s;uppo&s;ition, he locked the door, in
order to prevent interruption, and &s;tealing him|&s;elf
un$er the cloaths, &s;et fortune at defiance,
while he held the fair creature circled in his
arms.</P>
<P>Neverthele&s;s, near as he &s;eemed to be to the
happy accompli&s;hment of his de&s;ire, his hope
was again fru&s;trated by a fearful noi&s;e, which in
a moment waked his Amanda in a fright, and
for the pre&s;ent engaged all his attention: his
valet de chambre, whom Pallet had con&s;ulted as
a con&s;ederate, in his revenge again&s;t the lady of
plea&s;ure and her Jewi&s;h gallant, had hired of cer|tain
Bohemians, who chanced to lodge at the
inn, a jack-a&s;s adorned with bells, which, when
<PB N="174" REF="183">
every body was retired to re&s;t, and the Hebrew
&s;uppo&s;ed to be bedded with his mi&s;tre&s;s, they led
up-&s;tairs into a long thoroughfare, from which
the chambers were detached on each &s;ide; and
the painter, perceiving the lady's door a-jar, ac|cording
to his expectation, mounted this animal,
with intention to ride into the room, and di&s;turb
the lovers in the mid&s;t of their mutual endear|ments;
but the a&s;s, true to his kind, finding
him&s;elf be&s;trid by an unknown rider, in&s;tead of
advancing, in obedience to his conductor, re|treated
backwards to the other end of the pa&s;|&s;age,
in &s;pite of all the efforts of the painter,
who &s;purred, and kicked, and pummelled to no
purpo&s;e. It was the noi&s;e of this contention be|tween
Pallet and the a&s;s, which invaded the ears
of Peregrine and his mi&s;tre&s;s, neither of whom
could form the lea&s;t rational conjecture about the
cau&s;e of &s;uch &s;trange di&s;turbance, which in|crea&s;ed
as the animals approached their apart|ment;
till, at length, the Bourrique's retrograde
motion was ob&s;tructed by their door, which it
bur&s;t open, in a twinkling, with one kick, and
entered with &s;uch complication of &s;ound, as ter|rified
the lady almo&s;t into a fit, and threw her
lover into an agony of perplexity and confu&s;ion.
The painter, finding him&s;elf thus violently in|truded
into the bed-chamber of he knew not
whom, and dreading the re&s;entment of the po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;or,
who might di&s;charge a pi&s;tol at him, as a
robber who had broke into his apartment, was
overwhelmed with c$n&s;ternation, and redoubled
his exertion, to accompli&s;h a &s;peedy retreat,
&s;weating all the time with fear, and putting up
petitions to heaven for his &s;afety; but his ob&s;tinate
companion, regardle&s;s of his &s;ituation, in&s;tead of
<PB N="175" REF="184">
&s;ubmitting to his conduct, began to turn round
like a mill&s;tone, the united &s;ound of his feet and
bells producing a mo&s;t &s;urpri&s;ing concert. The
unfortunate rider, whirled about in this manner,
would have quitted his &s;eat, and left the bea&s;t to
his own amu&s;ement, but the rotation was &s;o ra|pid,
that the terror of a &s;evere fall hindered him
from attempting to di&s;mount, and in the de&s;pe|ration
of his heart, he &s;eized one of its ears,
which he pinched &s;o unmercifully, that the crea|ture
&s;et up his threat, and brayed aloud. This
hideous exclamation was no &s;ooner heard by the
fair Fl$ming, already chilled with panic, and
prepared with &s;uper&s;tition, than, believing her|&s;elf
vi&s;ited by the devil, who was permitted to
puni&s;h her for her infidelity to the marriage-bed,
&s;he uttered a fearful &s;cream, and began to repeat
her paterno&s;ter with a loud voice. Her lover,
finding him&s;elf under the nece&s;&s;ity of retiring,
&s;tarted up, and &s;tung with the mo&s;t violent pangs
of rage and di&s;appointment, ran directly to the
&s;pot from whence this diabolical noi&s;e &s;eemed to
proceed, and encountering the a&s;s, di&s;charged
&s;uch a volley of blows at him and his rider, that
the creature carried him off at a round trot, and
they roared in uni&s;on all the way. Having thus
cleared the room of &s;uch di&s;agreeable company,
he went back to his mi&s;tre&s;s, and a&s;&s;uring her,
that this was only &s;ome fooli&s;h prank of Pallet,
took his leave, with a promi&s;e of returning after
the quiet of the inn &s;hould be re-e&s;tabli&s;hed.</P>
<P>In the mean time the noi&s;e of the Bourrique,
the cries of the painter, and the lady's &s;cream,
had alarmed the whole hou&s;e; and the a&s;s, in the
precipitation of his retreat, &s;eeing people with
lights before him, took &s;helter in the apartment
<PB N="176" REF="185">
for which he was at fir&s;t de&s;igned, ju&s;t as the
Levite, arrou&s;ed at the uproar, had quitted his
Dulcinea, and was attempting to recover his own
chamber, unperceived; but, &s;eeing him&s;elf op|po&s;ed
by &s;uch an animal, mounted by a tall,
meagre, lanthorn-jawed figure, half naked, with
a white night-cap upon his head, which added to
the natural palene&s;s of his complexion, the Jew
was &s;orely troubled in mind, and believing it to
be an apparition of Balaam and his a&s;s, fled back|ward
with a nimble pace, and crept under the
bed, where he lay concealed. Mr. Jolter, and
the prie&s;t, who were the foremo&s;t of tho&s;e who
had been arrou&s;ed by the noi&s;e, were not un|moved
when they &s;aw &s;uch a &s;pectacle ru&s;h|ing
into this chamber, from whence the lady of
plea&s;ure began to &s;hri$k. The governor made a
full ha$t, and the Capuchin di&s;covered no incli|nation
to proceed. They were (however) by
the pre&s;&s;ure of the crowd that followed them,
thru&s;t forward to the door, through which the
vi&s;ion entered; and there Jolter, with great ce|remony,
complimented his reverence with the
pas, be&s;eeching him to walk in. The men$$|cant
was too courteous and humble to accept
this preheminence, and a very earne&s;t di&s;pute
en&s;ued; during which the a&s;s, in the cour&s;e of
his circuit, &s;hewed him&s;elf and rider, and in a
trice decided the conte&s;t; for, &s;truck with this
&s;econd glimp&s;e, both, at one in&s;tant, &s;prung
backward with &s;uch force, as overturned their
next men, who communicated the impul&s;e to
tho&s;e that &s;tood behind them, and the&s;e again to
others; &s;o that the whole pa&s;&s;age was &s;trewed
with a long file of people, that lay in a line, like
the &s;equel and dependance of a pack of cards. In
<PB N="177" REF="186">
the mid&s;t of this havock, our hero returned from
his own room, with an air of a&s;toni&s;hment, a&s;k|ing
the cau&s;e of this uproar, and receiving &s;uch
hints of intelligence as Jolter's con&s;ternation
would permit him to give, &s;natched the candle
out of his hand, and advanced into the haunted
chamber without he&s;itation, being followed by
all pre&s;ent, who broke forth into a long and
loud peal of laughter, when they perceived the
lu$icrous &s;ource of their di&s;quiet. The painter
him&s;elf made an effort to join their mirth, but he
had been &s;o harrowed by fear, and &s;marted &s;o
much with the pain of the di&s;cipline he had re|ceived
from Pickle, that he could not, with all
his endeavour, vanqui&s;h the ruefulne&s;s of his
countenance; and his attempt &s;erved only to in|crea&s;e
the aukwardne&s;s of his &s;ituation, which
was not at all mended by the behaviour of the
c$quette, who, furious with her di&s;appointment,
$$pped on a petticoat and bed-gown, and &s;pring|ing
upon him, like another Hecuba, with her
nails, deprived all one &s;ide of his no&s;e of the &s;kin,
and would not have left him an eye to &s;ee thro',
$f &s;ome of the company had not re&s;cued him
from her unmerciful talons. Provoked at this
outrage, as well as by her behaviour to him in
the Diligence, he publickly explained his inten|tion
$n entering her chamber in this equipage;
$word$, mi&s;&s;ing the Hebrew among the &s;pectators,
$word$ them, that he mu&s;t have ab&s;conded
&s;omewhere in the apartment: in con&s;equence of
this intimation, the room was immediately
&s;earched, and the mortified Levite pulled by the
heels from his lurking place; &s;o that Pallet had
the good fortune, at la&s;t, to transfer the laugh
<PB N="178" REF="187">
from him&s;elf to his rival, and the French ina|morata,
who accordingly underwent the ridicule

<P>NEverthele&s;s, Pallet was &s;till confounded,
and chagrined by one con&s;ideration, which
was no other than that of his having been &s;o
roughly handled in the chamber, belonging (as
he found upon enquiry) to the hand&s;ome young
lady, who was under the Capuchin's direction.
He recollected, that the door was fa&s;t locked,
when his bea&s;t bur&s;t it open, and he had no rea|&s;on
to believe that any per&s;on followed him in his
irruption: on the other hand, he could not ima|gine,
that &s;uch a gentle creature would either
attempt to commit, or be able to execute &s;uch a
de&s;perate a&s;&s;ault as that which his body had &s;u&s;|tained;
and her demeanor was &s;o mode&s;t and
circum&s;pect, that he dur&s;t not harbour the lea&s;t
&s;u&s;picion of her virtue.</P>
<P>The&s;e reflexions bewildered him in the laby|rinth
of thought: he rummaged his whole ima|gination,
endeavouring to account for what had
happened; and at length concluded, that either
Peregrine, or the devil, or both, mu&s;t have
been at the bottom of the whole affair, and de|termined,
for the &s;atisfaction of his curio&s;ity, to
watch our hero's motions, during the remaining
part of the night, &s;o narrowly, that his conduct,
<PB N="179" REF="188">
my&s;terious as it was, &s;hould not be able to elude
his penetration.</P>
<P>With the&s;e &s;entiments he retired to his own
room, after the a&s;s had been re&s;tored to the
right owners, and the prie&s;t had vi&s;ited and con|firmed
his fair ward, who had been almo&s;t di&s;|tracted
with fear; and &s;ilence no &s;ooner prevail|ed
again, than he crawled darkling towards her
door, and huddled him&s;elf up in an ob&s;cure cor|ner,
from whence he might ob&s;erve the ingre&s;s
or egre&s;s of any human creaure. He had not
long remained in this po&s;ture, when, fatigued
with this adventure, and that of the preceding
night, his faculties were gradually overpowered
with &s;lumber, and falling fa&s;t a&s;leep, he began
to &s;nore like a whole congregation of pre&s;byte|tians.
The Flemi&s;h beauty, hearing this di&s;cor|dant
noi&s;e in the pa&s;&s;age, began to be afraid of
&s;ome new alarm, and very prudently bolted her
door; &s;o that when her lover wanted to repeat
his vi&s;it, he was not only &s;urpri&s;ed and incen&s;ed
at this di&s;agreeable &s;erenade, the author of which
he did not know; but when, compelled by his
pa&s;&s;ion, which was by this time wound to the
highe&s;t pitch, he ventured to approach the en|trance,
he had the extreme mortification to find
him&s;elf &s;hut out; and he dur&s;t not knock, or
&s;ignify his pre&s;ence in any other manner, on ac|count
of the lady's reputation, which would have
greatly &s;uffered, had the &s;norer been waked by
his endeavours. Had he known that the per&s;on
who thus thwarted his views, was the painter,
$e would have taken &s;ome effectual &s;tep to re|move
him; but he could not conceive what
&s;hould induce Pallet to take up his re&s;idence in
that corner; nor could he u&s;e the a&s;&s;&s;tance of a
<PB N="180" REF="189">
light, to di&s;tingui&s;h him, becau&s;e there was not
a cand$e burning in the hou&s;e; and be&s;ides, the
&s;leeper might have opened his eyes in the very
moment of his being detected by Peregrine, who
would have incurred &s;u&s;picion, by appearing, at
&s;uch an hour, at that part of the inn, &s;o remote
from his own bed-chamber.</P>
<P>It is impo&s;&s;ible to de&s;cribe the rage and vexa|tion
of our hero, while he continued thus tanta|lized
upon the brink of bli&s;s, after his de&s;ire had
been exa&s;perated by the circum&s;tances of his two
former di&s;appointments. He ejaculated a thou|&s;and
execrations again&s;t his own fortune, cur&s;ed
all his fellow-travellers, without exception, vow|ed
revenge again&s;t the painter, who had twice
confounded his mo&s;t intere&s;ting &s;cheme, and was
tempted to execute immediate vengeance upon
the unknown cau&s;e of his pre&s;ent mi&s;adventure.
In this agony of di&s;traction did he &s;weat two
whole hours in the pa&s;&s;age, though not without
&s;ome faint hope of being delivered from his ter|mentor,
who (he imagined) upon waking, woul$
undoubtedly &s;hift his quarters, and leave the field
free to his de&s;igns; but when he heard the cock
repeat his &s;alutation to the morn, which began
to open on the rear of night, he could no longer
re&s;train his indignation, but going to his own
chamber, filed a ba&s;in with cold water, and,
&s;tanding at &s;ome di&s;tance, di&s;charged it full in
the face of the gaping &s;norer, who, over and
above the &s;urprize occa&s;ioned by the application,
was almo&s;t &s;uffocated by the liquor that entered
his mouth, and ran down into his wind pipe.
While he ga&s;ped like a per&s;on half drowned,
without knowing the nature of his di&s;a&s;ter, or
remembring the &s;ituation in which he fell a&s;leep;
<PB N="181" REF="190">
Peregrine retired to his own door, and, to his no
&s;mall a&s;toni&s;hment, from a long howl that in|vaded
his ears, learnt that the patient was no
other than Pallet, who had now, for the third
time, baulked his good fortune.</P>
<P>Enraged at the complicated tre&s;pa&s;&s;es of this
unfortunate offender, he ru&s;hed from his apart|ment
with a hor&s;e whip, and encountering the
painter in his flight, overturned him in the pa&s;|&s;age,
and exerci&s;ed the in&s;trument of his wrath
with great &s;everity, on pretence of mi&s;taking
him for &s;ome pre&s;umptuous cur, which had di|&s;turbed
the repo&s;e of the inn; nay, when he
called aloud for mercy in a &s;upplicating tone, and
his cha&s;tifer could no longer pretend to treat him
as a quadruped, &s;uch was the virulence of the
young gentleman's indignation, that he could
not help declaring his &s;atisfaction, by telling Pallet
he had richly de&s;erved the puni&s;hment he had un|dergone,
for his madne&s;s, felly and impertinence,
in contriving and executing &s;uch idle &s;chemes, as
had no other tendency than that of plaguing his
neighbours.</P>
<P>Pallet prote&s;ted with great vehemence, that he
was innocent as the child unborn of any inten|tion
to give umbrage to any per&s;on whatever,
except the I&s;raelite and his doxy, who he knew
had incurred his di&s;plea&s;ure. &startq;But, as God is
my Saviour! (&s;aid he) I believe I am per&s;ecuted
with witchcraft, and begin to think that damn'd
prie&s;t is an agent of the devil; for he has been
but two nights in our company, during which I
have not clo&s;ed an eye, but on the contrary have
been tormented by all the fiends of hell.&endq; Pickle
peevi&s;hly replied, that his torments had been oc|ca&s;ioned
by his own fooli&s;h imagination; and
<PB N="182" REF="191">
a&s;ked how he came to howl in that corner. The
painter, who did not think proper to own the
truth, &s;aid, that he had been tran&s;ported thither
by &s;ome preternatural conveyance, and &s;ou&s;ed in
water by an invi&s;ible hand: and the youth, in
hope of profiting by his ab&s;ence, advi&s;ed him to
retire immediately to his bed, and by &s;leep &s;trive
to comfort his brain, which &s;eemed to be not a
little di&s;ordered by the want of that refre&s;hment.
Pallet him&s;elf began to be very much of the &s;ame
way of thinking, and in compliance with &s;uch
whole&s;ome coun&s;el, betook him&s;elf to re&s;t, mut|tering
prayers all the way for the recovery of his
under&s;tanding.</P>
<P>Pickle attended him to his chamber, and lock|ing
him up, put the key in his own pocket, that
he might not have it in his power to interrupt
him again: but in his return he was met by Mr.
Jolter and the doctor, who had been a &s;econd
time alarmed by the painter's cries, and come thi|ther
to inquire about this new adventure. Half
frantic with &s;uch a &s;eries of di&s;appointments, he
cur&s;ed them in his heart for their un&s;ea&s;onable ap|pearance;
and when they que&s;tioned him about
Pallet, told them he had found him &s;tark &s;taring
mad, howling in a corner and wet to the &s;kin,
and conducted him to his room, where he was
now abed. The phy&s;ician hearing this circum|&s;tance,
made a merit of his vanity, and under
pretence of concern for the patient's welfare, de|&s;ired
he might have an opportunity of examining
the &s;ymptoms of his di&s;order, without lo&s;s of
time; alledging, that many di&s;ea&s;es might have
been &s;tifled in the birth, which afterwards baffled
all the endeavours of the medical art. The young
gentleman accordingly delivered the key, and
<PB N="183" REF="192">
once more withdrew into his own chamber, with
a view of &s;eizing the fir&s;t occa&s;ion that &s;hould
pre&s;ent it&s;elf of renewing his application to his
Amanda's door; while the doctor, in his way to
Pallet's apartment, hinted to the governor his
&s;u&s;picion, that the patient laboured under that
dreadful &s;ymptom called the hydrophobia, which
he ob&s;erved had &s;ometimes appeared in per&s;ons
who were not previou&s;ly bit by a mad dog. This
conjecture he founded upon the howl he uttered
when he was &s;ou&s;ed with water, and began to
recollect certain circum&s;tances of the painter's
behaviour for &s;ome day's pa&s;t, which now he
could plainly perceive had progno&s;ticated &s;ome
&s;uch calamity. He then a&s;cribed the di&s;temper
to the violent frights he had lately undergone,
affirmed that the affair of the Ba&s;tile had made
&s;uch a violent incroachment upon his under&s;tand|ing,
that his manner of thinking and &s;peaking
was intirely altered; and by a theory of his own
invention, explained the effects of fear upon a
loo&s;e &s;y&s;tem of nerves, and demon&s;trated the
modus in which the animal &s;pirits operate upon
the ideas and power of imagination.</P>
<P>This di&s;qui&s;ition, which was communicated
at the painter's door, might have la&s;ted till break|fa&s;t,
had not Jolter reminded him of his own
maxim, <HI>Venicnti occurrite morbo;</HI> upon which he
put the key to immediate u&s;e, and they walked
&s;oftly towards the bed, where the patient lay ex|tended
at full length in the arms of &s;lumber.
The phy&s;ician took notice of his breathing hard,
and his mouth being open; and from the&s;e diag|no&s;tics
declared, that the liquidum nervo&s;um was
intimately affected, and the &s;aliva impregnated
with the &s;piculated particles of the virus, how&s;o|ever
<PB N="184" REF="193">
contracted. This &s;entence was &s;till farther
confirmed by the &s;tate of his pul&s;e, which being
full and &s;low, indicated an oppre&s;&s;ed circulation,
from a lo&s;s of ela&s;ticity in the propelling arteries;
and he propo&s;ed, that he &s;hould immediately
&s;uffer a &s;econd a&s;per&s;ion of water, which would
not only contribute to the cure, but al&s;o certify
them beyond all po&s;&s;ibility of doubt, with regard
to the &s;tate of the di&s;ea&s;e: for it would evidently
appear, from the manner in which he would bear
the application, whether or not his horror of water
amounted to a confirmed hydropho$$a. Mr. Jolter,
in compliance with this propo&s;al, began to empty
a bottle of water, which he found in the room
in a ba&s;in; when he was interrupted by the pre|&s;criber,
who advi&s;ed him to u&s;e the contents of
the chamber-pot, which being impregnated with
$alt, would operate more effectually than pure
element. Thus directed, the governor lifted up
the ve&s;&s;el, which was rep$$$ with medicine, and
with one turn of his hands di&s;charged the whole
healing inundation upon the ill-$men'd patient,
who waking in the utmo&s;t di&s;traction of horror,
yelled mo&s;t hideou&s;ly, ju&s;t at the time when Pe|regrine
had brought his mi&s;tre&s;s to a parley, and
entertained hopes of being admitted into her
chamber.</P>
<P>Terrified at this exclamation, &s;he in&s;tantly
broke off the treaty, be&s;eeching him to retire
from the door, that her honour might receive no
injury from his being found in that place; and
he had ju&s;t enough of recollection left to &s;ee the
nece&s;&s;ity of obeying the order; in conformity to
which he retreated, well nigh deprived of his
&s;en&s;es, and almo&s;t per&s;uaded, that &s;o many unac|countable
di&s;appointments mu&s;t have pr$ceeded
<PB N="185" REF="194">
from &s;ome &s;upernatural cau&s;e, of which the idiot
Pallet was no more than the involuntary in&s;tru|ment.</P>
<P>Mean while, the doctor having a&s;certained the
malady of the patient, who&s;e cries, interrupted
by frequent &s;obs and &s;ighs, he interpreted into the
barking of a dog; having no more &s;alt-water at
hand, re&s;olved to renew the bath with &s;uch ma|terials
as chance would afford, and actually laid
hold of the bottle and ba&s;in. But by this time,
the painter had recovered the u&s;e of his &s;en&s;es &s;o
well, as to perceive his drift; and &s;tarting up,
like a frantic Bedlamite, ran directly to his &s;word,
&s;wearing with many horrid imprecations, that he
would murder them both immediately, if he
&s;hould be hanged before dinner. They did not
choo&s;e to wait the i&s;&s;ue of his threat, but retired
with &s;uch precipitation, that the phy&s;ician had al|mo&s;t
di&s;located his &s;houlder, by running again&s;t
one &s;ide of the entry; and Jolter having pulled
the door after him, and turned the key, betook
him&s;elf to flight, roaring aloud for a&s;&s;i&s;tance. His
colleg$e &s;eeing the door &s;ec$red, val$ed him&s;elf
upon his re&s;olution, and exhorted him to return;
declaring, that for his own part, he was more
afraid of the madman's teeth than of his weapon,
and admoni&s;hing the governor to re-enter, and
execute what they had left undone; &startq;Go in (&s;aid
he) without $ear or apprehen&s;ion, and if any ac|cident
&s;hall happen to you, either from his &s;laver
or his &s;word, I will a&s;&s;i&s;t you with my advice,
which from this &s;tation I can more coolly and di|&s;tinctly
admini&s;ter, than I &s;hould be able to &s;up|$$$,
if my ideas were di&s;turbed, or my attention
engaged in any per&s;onal concern.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="186" REF="195">
Jolter, who could make no objection to the
ju&s;tne&s;s of the conclu&s;ion, frankly owned, that
he had no inclination to try the experiment; ob|&s;erving,
that &s;elf pre&s;ervation was the fir&s;t law
of nature; that his connexions with the unhappy
$unatic were but &s;light, and that it could not be
rea&s;onably expected, that he would run &s;uch ri&s;ks
for his &s;ervice, as were declined by one who had
&s;et out with him from England on the footing of
a companion. This in&s;inuation introduced a di&s;|pute
upon the nature of benevolence and the
moral &s;en&s;e, which (the republican argued) ex|i&s;ted
independent of any private con&s;ideration,
and could never be affected by any contingent
circum&s;tance of time and fortune; while the
other, who abhorred his principles, a&s;&s;erted the
duties and excellence of private friend&s;hip, with
infinite rancour of altercation.</P>
<P>During the hotte&s;t of the argument, they were
joined by the Capuchin, who being a&s;toni&s;hed to
&s;ee them thus virulently engaged at the door, and
to hear the painter bellowing within the chamber,
conjured them in the name of God to tell him
the cau&s;e of that confu&s;ion, which had kept the
whole hou&s;e in continual alarm during the be&s;t
part of the night, and &s;eemed to be the immediate
work of the devil and his angels. When the
governor gave him to under&s;tand, that Pallet was
vi&s;ited with an evil &s;pirit, he muttered a prayer
of St. Antonio de Padua, and undertook to cure
the painter, provided he could be &s;ecured &s;o as
that he might, without danger to him&s;elf, burn
part of a certain relick under his no&s;e, which he
a&s;&s;ured them was equal to the miraculous power
of Eleazar's ring. They expre&s;&s;ed great curio&s;ity
to know what this trea&s;ure was; and the prie&s;t
<PB N="187" REF="196">
was prevailed upon to tell them in confidence,
that it was a collection of the parings of the nails
belonging to tho&s;e two madmen whom Je&s;us
purged of the legion of devils that afterwards en|tered
the &s;wine. So &s;aying, he pulled from one
of his pockets a &s;mall box, containing about an
ounce of the parings of an hor&s;e's hoof; at fight
of which, the governor could not help &s;miling,
on account of the gro&s;&s;ne&s;s of the impo&s;ition;
and the doctor a&s;ked, with a &s;upercilious &s;mile,
whether tho&s;e maniacs whom Je&s;us cured, were
of the &s;orrel complexion, or dapple grey; for,
from the texture of the&s;e parings, he could prove,
that the original owners were of the quadruped
order, and even di&s;tingui&s;h, that their feet had
been fortified with &s;hoes of iron.</P>
<P>The mendicant, who bore an inveterate grudge
again&s;t this &s;on of Ae&s;culapius, ever &s;ince he had
made &s;o free with the catholic religion, replied
with great bitterne&s;s, that he was a wretch with
whom no Chri&s;tian ought to communicate; that
the vengeance of heaven would one day overtake
him, on account of his profanity; and that his
heart was &s;hod with a metal much harder than
iron, which he was afraid nothing but hell-fire
would be able to melt.</P>
<P>It was now broad day, and all the &s;ervants of
the inn were afoot. Peregrine, &s;eeing it would be
impo&s;&s;ible to obtain any &s;ort of indemnification
for the time he had lo&s;t, and the perturbation of
his &s;pirits hindering him from enjoying repo&s;e,
which was, moreover, ob&s;tructed by the noi&s;e
of Pallet and his attendants, put on his cloaths at
once, and in exceeding ill humour arrived at the
&s;pot where this triumvirate &s;tood debating about
the means of overpowering the furious painter,
<PB N="188" REF="197">
who &s;till continued his &s;ong of oaths and execra|tions,
and made &s;undry efforts to break open the
door. Chagrin'd as our hero was, he could not
help laughing when he heard how the patient had
been treated; and his indignation changing into
compa&s;&s;ion, he called to him through the key-hole,
de&s;iring to know the rea&s;on of his di&s;tracted
behaviour. Pallet no &s;ooner recognized his voice,
than lowering his own to a whimpering tone,
&startq;My dear friend! (&s;aid he) I have at la&s;t de|tected
the ruffians who have per&s;ecuted me &s;o
much. I caught them in the fact of &s;uffocating
me with cold water; and by the Lord! I will
be revenged, or may I never live to fini&s;h my
Cleopatia. For the love of God! open the door,
and I will make that conceited pagan, that pre|tender
to ta&s;te, that fal&s;e devotee of the ancients,
who poi&s;ons people with fillykickabies and devil's
dung; I &s;ay, I will make him a monument of
my wrath, and an example to all the cheats and
impo&s;tors of the faculty: and as for that thick-headed
in&s;olent pedant his confederate, who
emptied my own jordan upon me while I &s;lept,
he had better have been in his beloved Paris,
botching &s;chemes for his friend the pretender,
than incurred the effects of my re&s;entment.
Gad&s;bodikins! I won't leave him a wind-pipe for
the hangman to &s;top, at the end of another re|bellion.&endq;</P>
<P>Pickle told him, that his conduct had been &s;o
extravagant, as to confirm the whole company
in the belief, that he was actually deprived of his
&s;en&s;es; on which &s;uppo&s;ition, Mr. Jolter and the
doctor had acted the part of friends, in doing that
which they thought mo&s;t conducive to his reco|$ery;
&s;o that their concern merited his thankful
<PB N="189" REF="198">
acknowledgment, in&s;tead of his frantic menaces:
and that for his own part, he would be the fir&s;t
to condemn him, as one utterly bere&s;t of his wits,
and give orders for his being &s;ecured as a mad|man,
unle&s;s he would immediately give a proof
of his &s;anity, by laying a&s;ide his &s;word, com|po&s;ing
his &s;pirits, and thanking his injured friends
for their care of his per&s;on.</P>
<P>This alternative quieted his tran&s;ports in a mo|ment;
he was terrified at the apprehen&s;ion of
being treated like a Bedlamite, being dubious of
the &s;tate of his own brain; and on the other
hand, had conceived &s;uch an horror and antipa|thy
for his tormentors, that, far from believing
$word$ obliged by what they had done, he could
not even think of them without the utmo&s;t rage
and dete&s;tation. He therefore, in the mo&s;t tran|quil
voice he could a&s;&s;ume, prote&s;ted, that he
never was le&s;s out of his &s;en&s;es than at pre&s;ent,
though he did not know how long he might re|tain
them, if he &s;hould be con&s;idered in the light
of a luntic and that, in order to prove his being
$span$ he was willing to &s;acrifice the re|$$$ment
he &s;o ju&s;tly harboured again&s;t tho&s;e who
by their malice had brought him to this pa&s;s:
$word$, as he apprehended, it would be the greate&s;t
$word$ of madne&s;s he could exhibit, to thank them
for the mi&s;chiefs they had brought upon him, he
$word$ to be excu&s;ed from making any &s;uch con|$$$$$$
and &s;wore he would $word$ every thing,
$word$ than be guilty of &s;uch mean $word$.</P>
<P>Peregrine held a con&s;ultation upon this reply,
when the governor and phy&s;ician &s;trenuou&s;ly a$|gued
again&s;t any capitulation with a $word$ and
pr$po&s;ed that &s;ome method might be taken to
$word$ $etter and convey him into a dark room,
<PB N="190" REF="199">
where he might be treated according to the rules
of art. But the Capuchin under&s;tanding the cir|cum&s;tances
of the ca&s;e, undertook to re&s;tore him
to his former &s;tate, without having recour&s;e to
&s;uch violent mea&s;ures: and Pickle, who was a
better judge of the affair than any per&s;on pre&s;ent,
opened the door without further he&s;itation, and
di&s;played the poor painter &s;tanding with a woeful
countenance, &s;hivering in his &s;hirt, which was as
wet as if he had been dragged through the Den|der;
a &s;pectacle which gave &s;uch offence to the
cha&s;te eyes of the Hebrew's mi&s;tre&s;s, who was
by this time one of the &s;pectators, that &s;he turned
her head another way, and withdrew to her own
room, exclaiming again&s;t the indecent practices
of men.</P>
<P>Pallet, &s;eeing the young gentleman enter, ran
to him, and &s;haking him by the hand, called him
his be&s;t friend, and &s;aid he had re&s;cued him from
tho&s;e who had a de&s;ign again&s;t his life. The
prie&s;t would have produced his parings, and ap|plied
them to his no&s;e; but was hindered by
Pickle, who advi&s;ed the patient to &s;hi$t him&s;elf,
and put on his cloaths: and this being done with
great order and deliberation, Mr. Jolter, who,
with the doctor, had kept at a wary di&s;tance, in
expectation of &s;eeing &s;ome &s;trange effects of his
di&s;traction, began to believe that he had been
guilty of a mi&s;take, and accu&s;ed the phy&s;ician of
having mi&s;led him by his fal&s;e diagno&s;tic. The
doctor &s;till in&s;i&s;ted upon his former declaration,
a&s;&s;uring him, that although Pallet enjoyed a &s;hort
interval for the pre&s;ent, the delirium would &s;oon
recur, unle&s;s they would profit by this momentary
calm, and order him to be blooded, bli&s;tered and
purged with all imaginable di&s;patch.</P>
<P><PB N="191" REF="200">
The governor, however, notwith&s;tanding this
caution, advanced to the injured party, and begg'd
pardon for the &s;hare he had in giving him &s;uch di|&s;turbance,
declaring in the mo&s;t &s;olemn manner,
that he had no other intention than that of con|tributing
towards his welfare, and that his beha|viour
was the re&s;ult of the phy&s;ician's pre&s;crip|tion,
which he affirmed was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary
for the recovery of his health.</P>
<P>The painter, who had very little gall in his
di&s;po&s;ition, was &s;atisfied with this apology; but
his re&s;entment, which was before divided, now
glowed with double fire again&s;t his fir&s;t fellow|traveller,
whom he looked upon as the author of
all the mi&s;chances he had undergone, and marked
out for his vengeance accordingly. Yet the doors
of reconciliation were not &s;hut again&s;t the doctor,
who with great ju&s;tice might have transferred
this load of offence from him&s;elf to Peregrine,
who was, without doubt, the &s;ource of the
painter's misfortune: but, in that ca&s;e, he mu&s;t
have owned him&s;elf mi&s;taken in his medical ca|pacity;
and he did not think the friend&s;hip of
Pallet important enough to &s;way him to &s;uch
conde&s;cen&s;ion; &s;o that he re&s;olved to neglect him
intirely, and gradually forget the former corre|&s;pondence
he had maintained with a per&s;on whom
he deemed &s;o unworthy of his notice.</P>

expre&s;&s;ed her &s;orrow for being the innocent cau&s;e
of his anxiety; &s;aid, &s;he hoped la&s;t night's ad|venture
would be a &s;alutary warning to both
their &s;ouls; for &s;he was per&s;uaded, that her virtue
was protected by the intervention of heaven; that
whatever impre&s;&s;ion it might have made upon
him, &s;he was enabled by it to adhere to that duty
from which her pa&s;&s;ion had begun to &s;werve, and
be&s;eeching him to forget her for his own peace,
gave him to under&s;tand, that neither the plan &s;he
had laid down for her own conduct, nor the
dictates of her honour, would allow her to re|ceive
his vi&s;its, or carry on any other corre&s;pon|dence
with him, while &s;he was re&s;tricted by the
articles of her marriage-vow.</P>
<P>This explanation produced &s;uch a violent ef|fect
upon her admirer, that he was for &s;ome mi|nutes
deprived of the faculty of &s;peech, which
he no &s;ooner recovered, than he gave vent to
the mo&s;t unbridled tran&s;ports of pa&s;&s;ion. He
taxed her with barbarity and indifference; told
her that &s;he had robbed him of his rea&s;on and in|ternal
peace; that he would follow her to the
ends of the earth, and cea&s;e to live &s;ooner than
<PB N="194" REF="203">
cea&s;e to love her; that he would &s;acrifice the in|nocent
fool who had been the occa&s;ion of all this
di&s;quiet, and murder every man whom he con|&s;idered
as an ob&s;truction to his views. In a
word, his pa&s;&s;ions, which had continued &s;o long
in a &s;tate of the highe&s;t fermentation, together
with the want of that repo&s;e which calms and
quiets the perturbation of the &s;pirits, had wrought
him up to a pitch of real di&s;traction: and while
he uttered the&s;e delirious expre&s;&s;ions, the tears
ran down his cheeks, and he underwent &s;uch
agitation, that the tender heart of the fair Fle|ming
was affected with his condition; and, while
her own face was bedewed with the &s;treams of
&s;ympathy, &s;he begged him for heaven's &s;ake to
be compo&s;ed, and promi&s;ed, for his &s;atisfaction,
to abate &s;omewhat of the rigor of her purpo&s;e.
Con&s;oled by this kind declaration, he recollected
him&s;elf, and taking out his pencil, gave her his
addre&s;s, when &s;he had a&s;&s;ured him, that he &s;hould
hear from her in four and twenty hours at farthe&s;t,
after their &s;eparation.</P>
<P>Thus &s;oothed, he regained the empire of him|&s;elf,
and by degrees recovered his &s;erenity. But
this was not the ca&s;e with his Amanda, who, from
this &s;ample of his di&s;po&s;ition, dreaded the impe|tuo&s;ity
of his youth, and was effectually deterred
from entering into any engagements that might
&s;ubject her peace and reputation to the ra&s;h ef|fects
of &s;uch a violent &s;pirit. Though &s;he was
captivated by his per&s;on and accompli&s;hments,
&s;he had reflection enough to fore&s;ee, that the
longer &s;he countenanced his pa&s;&s;ion, her own
heart would be more and more irretrievably en|gaged,
and the quiet of her life the more ex|po&s;ed
to continual interruption. She therefore
<PB N="195" REF="204">
profited by the&s;e con&s;iderations, and a &s;en&s;e of re|ligious
honour, which helped her to with&s;tand the
&s;ugge&s;tions of inclination; and re&s;olved to amu&s;e
her lover with fal&s;e hopes, until &s;he &s;hould have
it in her power to relinqui&s;h his conver&s;ation,
without running any ri&s;k of &s;uffering by the in|con&s;iderate
&s;allies of his love. It was with this
view, that &s;he de&s;ired he would not in&s;i&s;t upon
attending her to her mother's hou&s;e, when the
Diligence arrived at Bru&s;&s;els; and he, cajoled by
her artifice, took a formal leave of her, together
with the other &s;trangers, fixing his habitation at
the inn to which he and his fellow-travellers had
been directed, in the impatient expectation of re|ceiving
a kind &s;ummons from her, within the li|mited
time.</P>
<P>Mean while, in order to divert his imagina|tion,
he went to &s;ee the &s;tadthou&s;e, park and
ar&s;enal, took a &s;uperficial view of the famous
book&s;eller's cabinet of curio&s;ities, and &s;pent the
evening at the Italian opera, which was at that
time exhibited for the entertainment of Prince
Charles of Lorrain, then governor of the Low
Countries. In &s;hort, the &s;tated period was al|mo&s;t
elap&s;ed, when Peregrine was favoured with
a letter to this purpo&s;e:</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>&startq;SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IF you knew what violence I do my own heart,
in declaring that I have withdrawn my&s;elf for
ever from your addre&s;&s;es, you would &s;urely ap|plaud
the &s;acrifice I make to virtue, and &s;trive to
imitate this example of &s;elf-denial. Yes, Sir,
heaven hath lent me grace to &s;truggle with my
guilty pa&s;&s;ion, and henceforth to avoid the dan|gerous
&s;ight of him who in&s;pired it. I therefore
<PB N="196" REF="205">
conjure you, by the regard you ought to have for
the eternal welfare of us both, as well as by the
e&s;teem and affection you profe&s;s, to war with
your unruly inclination, and de&s;i&s;t from all at|tempts
of fru&s;trating the laudable re&s;olution I have
made. Seek not to invade the peace of one
who loves you, to di&s;turb the quiet of a family
that never did you wrong, and alienate the
thoughts of a weak woman from a de&s;erving
man, who, by the mo&s;t &s;acred claim, is ve&s;ted
with the full po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of her heart.&endq;</P>
<P>This billet, without either date or &s;ub&s;cription,
bani&s;hed all remains of di&s;cretion from the mind
of our hero, who ran in&s;tantly to the landlord,
in all the exta&s;y of madne&s;s, and demanded to
&s;ee the me&s;&s;enger who brought the letter, on
pain of putting his whole family to the &s;word.
The innkeeper, terrified by his looks and me|naces,
fell upon his knees, prote&s;ting in the face
of heaven, that he was utterly ignorant and inno|cent
of any thing that could give him offence, and
that the billet was brought by a per&s;on whom he
did not know, and who retired immediately, &s;ay|ing,
it required no an&s;wer. He then gave utterance
to his fury, in a thou&s;and imprecations and invec|tives
again&s;t the writer, whom he di&s;honoured
with the appellations of a coquette, a jilt, an
adventurer, who, by means of a pimping prie&s;t,
had defrauded him of his money. He denounced
vengeance again&s;t the Mendicant, whom he &s;wore
he would ca&s;trate, if ever he &s;hould &s;et eyes on
him again: and the painter unluckily appearing
during this paroxy&s;m of rage, he &s;eized him by
the throat, &s;aying he was ruined by his accur&s;ed
folly; and in all likelihood poor Pallet would
<PB N="197" REF="206">
have been &s;trangled, had not Jolter interpo&s;ed in
his behalf, be&s;eeching his pupil to have mercy
upon the &s;ufferer, and with infinite anxiety de|&s;iring
to know the cau&s;e of this violent a&s;&s;ault. He
received no an&s;wer, but a &s;tring of incoherent
cur&s;es, and when the painter, with un&s;peakable
a&s;toni&s;hment, took God to witne&s;s, that he had
done nothing to di&s;oblige him, the governor be|gan
to think in &s;ad earne&s;t, that Peregrine's vi|vacity
had at length ri&s;en to the tran&s;ports of
actual madne&s;s, and was him&s;elf almo&s;t di&s;tracted
with this &s;uppo&s;ition. That he might the better
judge what remedy ought to be applied, he u&s;ed
his whole influence, and practi&s;ed all his eloquence
upon the youth, in order to learn the immediate
cau&s;e of his delirium. He employed the mo&s;t
pathetic intreaties, and even &s;hed tears in the
cour&s;e of his &s;upplication; &s;o that Pickle (the
fir&s;t violence of the hurricane being blown over)
was a&s;hamed of his own imprudence, and retired
to his chamber, in order to recollect his di&s;&s;ipated
thoughts: there he &s;hut him&s;elf up, and, for
the &s;econd time, peru&s;ing the fatal epi&s;tle, began
to waver in his opinion of the author's character
and intention. He &s;ometimes con&s;idered her as
one of tho&s;e nymphs who, under the ma&s;k of in|nocence
and &s;implicity, practi&s;e upon the hearts
and pur&s;es of unwary and unexperienced youths:
this was the &s;ugge&s;tion of his wrath, inflamed
by di&s;appointment; but, when he reflected upon
the circum&s;tances of her behaviour, and recalled
her particular charms to his imagination, the &s;e|verity
of his cen&s;ure gave way, and his heart
declared in favour of her &s;incerity. Yet even
this con&s;ideration aggravated the &s;en&s;e of his lo&s;s,
and he was in danger of relap&s;ing into his former
<PB N="198" REF="207">
di&s;traction, when his pa&s;&s;ion was a little becalmed
by the hope of &s;eeing her again, either by acci|dent,
or in the course of a diligent and minute in|quiry,
which he forthwith re&s;olved to &s;et on $oot.
He had rea&s;on to believe, that her own heart
&s;ould e&s;pou&s;e his cau&s;e, in &s;pite of her virtue's
determination, and did not de&s;pair of meeting
with the Capuchin, who&s;e good offices he knew
he could at any time command. Comforted

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Peregrine meets with Mrs. Hornbeck, and is con|soled
for his lo&s;s. His valet de chambre is em|broiled
with her duenna, whom, however, he
finds means to appea&s;e.</HEAD>
<P>EVERY thing having thus resumed its na|tural
channel, they dined together in great
Tranquillity; and in the afternoon, peregrine, on
Pretence of &s;taying at home to write letters, while
his companions were at the coffee-hou&s;e, ordered a
coach to be called, and with his valet de chambre,
who was the only per&s;on acquainted with the pre|sent
&s;tate of his thoughts, &s;et out for the Prome|nade,
to which all the ladies of fa&s;hion resort in
<PB N="199" REF="208">
the evening, during the &s;ummer-&s;ea&s;on, in hopes
of &s;eeing his fugitive among the re&s;t.</P>
<P>Having made a circuit round the walk, and
narrowly ob&s;erved every female in the place, he
perceived at &s;ome di&s;tance the livery of Hornbeck
upon a lacquey that &s;tood at the back of a coach:
upon which, he ordered his man to reconnoitre
the &s;aid carriage, while he pulled up his gla&s;&s;es,
that he might not be di&s;covered, before he &s;hould
have received &s;ome intelligence, by which he
might conduct him&s;elf on this unexpected occa|&s;ion,
that already began to interfere with the pur|po&s;e
of his coming thither, though it could not
di&s;pute his attention with the idea of his charm|ing
Unknown.</P>
<P>His Mercury having made his ob&s;ervations, re|ported,
that there was no body in the coach but
Mrs. Hornbeck and an elderly woman, who had
all the air of a duenna, and that the &s;ervant was
not the &s;ame footman who had attended them in
France. Encouraged by this information, our
hero ordered him&s;elf to be driven clo&s;e up to that
&s;ide of their convenience on which his old mi&s;tre&s;s
&s;at, and acco&s;ted her with the u&s;ual &s;alutation.
This lady no &s;ooner beheld her gallant, than her
cheeks reddened with a double glow; and &s;he
exclaimed, &startq;Dear brother, I'm overjoy'd to &s;ee
you! Pray come into our coach.&endq; He took the
hint immediately, and complying with her re|que&s;t,
embraced this new &s;i&s;ter with great af|fection.</P>
<P>Perceiving that her attendant was very much
&s;urpri&s;ed and alarmed at this unexpected meet|ing,
&s;he, in order to bani&s;h her &s;u&s;picion, and
at the &s;ame time give her lover his cue, told him
that his brother (meaning her hu&s;band) was gone
<PB N="200" REF="209">
to the Sp$ for a few weeks, by the advice of phy|&s;icians,
on account of his ill &s;tate of health; and
that, from his la&s;t letter, &s;he had the plea&s;ure to
tell him, he was in a fair way of doing well.
The young gentleman expre&s;&s;ed his &s;atisfaction at
this piece of news, ob&s;erving with an air of fra|ternal
concern, that if his brother had not made
too free with his con&s;titution, his friends in Eng|land
would have had no occa&s;ion to repine at his
ab&s;ence and want of health, by which he was
bani&s;hed from his own country and connexions.
He then a&s;ked with an affectation of &s;urprize,
why &s;he had not accompanied her &s;pou&s;e? and
was given to under&s;tand, that his tenderne&s;s of
affection would not &s;uffer him to expo&s;e her to
the fatigues of the journey, which lay among
rocks that were almo&s;t inacce&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>The duenna's doubts being ea&s;ed by this pre|amble
of conver&s;ation, he changed the &s;ubject to
the plea&s;ures of the place; and among other &s;uch
que&s;tions, inquired if &s;he had as yet vi&s;ited Ver|&s;ailles?
This is a public hou&s;e &s;ituated upon the
canal, at the di&s;tance of about two miles from
town, and accommodated with tolerable gardens
for the entertainment of company. When &s;he
replied in the negative, he propo&s;ed to accom|pany
her thither immediately; but the gover|nante,
who had hitherto &s;at &s;ilent, objected to
this propo&s;al, telling them, in broken Engli&s;h, that
as the lady was under her care, &s;he could not an|&s;wer
to Mr. Hornbeck for allowing her to vi&s;it
&s;uch a &s;u&s;picious place. &startq;As for that matter,
Madam, (&s;aid the confident gallant) give your|&s;elf
no trouble, the con&s;equences &s;hall be at my
peril; and I will undertake to in&s;ure you again&s;t
my brother's re&s;entment.&endq; So &s;aying, he directed
<PB N="201" REF="210">
the coachman to the place, and ordered his own
to follow, under the au&s;pices of his valet de
chambre, while the old gentlewoman, over-ruled
by his a&s;&s;urance, quietly &s;ubmitted to his autho|rity.</P>
<P>Being arrived at the place, he handed the la|dies
from the coach, and then, for the fir&s;t time,
ob&s;erved that the duenna was lame, a circum|&s;tance
of which he did not &s;cruple to take the ad|vantage;
for they had &s;carce alighted, and drank
a gla&s;s of wine, when he advi&s;ed his &s;i&s;ter to en|joy
a walk in the garden: and although the at|tendant
made &s;hift to keep them almo&s;t always in
view, they enjoyed a detached conver&s;ation, in
which Peregrine learnt, that the true cau&s;e of
her being left behind at Bru&s;&s;els, whil&s;t her hu&s;|band
proceeded to Spa, was his dread of the
company and $amiliarities of that place, to which
his jealou&s;y dur&s;t not expo&s;e her; and that &s;he
had lived three weeks in a convent at Li&s;le, from
which &s;he was delivered by his own free motion,
becau&s;e indeed he could no longer exi&s;t without
her company; and la&s;tly, our lover under&s;tood,
that her governante was a mere dragon, who had
been recommended to him by a Spani&s;h merchant,
who&s;e wife &s;he attended to her dying day: but
&s;he very much que&s;tioned whether or not her fi|delity
was proof enough again&s;t money and &s;trong
waters. Peregrine a&s;&s;ured her the experiment
&s;hould be tried before parting; and they agreed
to pa&s;s the n$ght at Ver&s;ailles, provided his en|deavours
&s;hould &s;ucceed.</P>
<P>Having exerci&s;ed them&s;elves in this manner,
until his duenna's &s;pirits were pretty much ex|haulted,
that &s;he might be the better di&s;po&s;ed to
recruit them with a gla&s;s of liqueur, they returned
<PB N="202" REF="211">
to their apartment, and the cordial was recom|mended
and received in a bumper: but as it did
not produce &s;uch a vi&s;ible alteration as the &s;an|guine
hopes of Pickle had made him expect, and
the old gentlewoman ob&s;erved that it began to be
late, and that the gates would be &s;hut in a little
time, he filled up a parting gla&s;s, and pledged her
in equal quantity. Her blood was too much
chilled to be warmed even by this extraordinary
do&s;e, which made immediate innovation in the
brain of our youth, who in the gaiety of his ima|gination
overwhelmed this She-Argus with &s;uch
profu&s;ion of gallantry, that &s;he was more intoxi|cated
with his expre&s;&s;ions than with the &s;pirits
&s;he had drank; and when in the cour&s;e of toying
he dropt a pur&s;e into her bo&s;om, &s;he &s;eemed
to forget how the night wore, and with the ap|probation
of her charge, a&s;&s;ented to his propo&s;al
of having &s;omething for &s;upper.</P>
<P>This was a great point which our adventurer
had gained, and yet he plainly perceived that the
governante mi&s;took his meaning, by giving her|&s;elf
credit for all the pa&s;&s;ion he had profe&s;&s;ed. As
this error could be rectified by no other means
than tho&s;e of plying her with the bottle, until
her di&s;tingui&s;hing faculties &s;hould be overpower|ed,
he promoted a quick circulation, and &s;he
did him ju&s;tice, without any manife&s;t &s;igns of
inebriation, &s;o long, that his own eyes began to
r$el in the &s;ockets; and he found, that before his
&s;cheme could be accompli&s;hed, he &s;hould be ef|fectually
unfitted for all the purpo&s;es of love.
He therefore had recour&s;e to his valet de chambre,
who under&s;tood the hint as &s;oon as it was given,
and readily undertook to perform the part, of
which his ma&s;ter had play'd the prelude. This
<PB N="203" REF="212">
affair being &s;ettled to his &s;atisfaction, and the
night at odds with morning, he took an op|portunity
of imparting to the ear of this aged
Dulcinea a kind whi&s;per, importing a promi&s;e
of vi&s;iting her, when his &s;i&s;ter &s;hould be retired
to her own chamber, and an earne&s;t de&s;ire of
leaving her door unlocked.</P>
<P>This agreeable intimation being communicated,
he conveyed a caution of the &s;ame nature to
Mrs. Hornbeck, as he led her to her apartment;
and darkne&s;s and &s;ilence no &s;ooner prevailed in
the hou&s;e, than he and his tru&s;ty &s;quire &s;et out
on their different voyages; and every thing would
have &s;ucceeded according to their wi&s;h, had not
the valet de chambre &s;uffered him&s;elf to fall a&s;leep
at the &s;ide of his inamorata, and in the agitation
of a violent dream, exclaimed in a voice &s;o un|like
to that of her &s;uppo&s;ed adorer, that &s;he di|&s;tingui&s;hed
the difference at once; and waking
him with a pinch and a loud &s;hriek, threatened
to pro&s;ecute him for a rape, and reviled him with
all the epithets her rage and di&s;appointment could
&s;ugge&s;t.</P>
<P>The Frenchman finding him&s;elf detected, be|haved
with great temper and addre&s;s: he begg'd
&s;he would compo&s;e her&s;elf, on account of her
own reputation, which was extremely dear to
him; prote&s;ted, that he had a mo&s;t inviolable
e&s;teem for her per&s;on; and that if he had not al|ready
given convincing proofs of his pa&s;&s;ion, he
was di&s;po&s;ed to do every thing in his power for her
&s;atisfaction. The&s;e repre&s;entations, mingled with
&s;ome little practical expre&s;&s;ions of tenderne&s;s, had
weight with the duenna, who, upon recollection,
comprehended the whole affair, and thought it
would be her intere&s;t to bring matters to an ac|commodation.
<PB N="204" REF="213">
She therefore admitted the apo|logies
of her bedfellow, provided he would pro|mi&s;e
to atone by marriage for the injury &s;he had
&s;u&s;tained; and in this particular he &s;et her heart
at ea&s;e by repeated vows, which he uttered with
&s;urpri&s;ing volubility, though without any inten|tion
to perform the lea&s;t tittle of their contents.</P>
<P>Peregrine, who had been alarmed by her ex|clamation,
and run to the door with a view of
interpo&s;ing, according to the emergency of the
ca&s;e, over-hearing the affair thus compromi&s;ed,
returned to his mi&s;tre&s;s, who was highly entertain|ed
with an account of what had pa&s;&s;ed, fore&s;eeing,
that for the future &s;he &s;hould be under no diffi|culty
or re&s;triction from the &s;everity of her guard.</P>

a degree, that he re&s;olved to lay an ambu&s;h for
this invader, and at once di&s;qualify him from di|&s;turbing
his repo&s;e, by maintaining further cor|re&s;pondence
with his wife.</P>
<P>Mean while the lovers enjoyed them&s;elves
without re&s;traint, and Peregrine's plan of inquiry
after his dear Unknown was for the pre&s;ent po&s;t|poned.
His fellow-travellers were confounded at
his my&s;terious motions, which filled the heart of
Jolter with anxiety and terror. This careful
conductor was fraught with &s;uch experience of
his pupil's di&s;po&s;ition, that he trembled with the
apprehen&s;ion of &s;ome &s;udden accident, and lived
in continual alarm, like a man that walks under
the wall of a nodding tower. Nor did he enjoy
any alleviation of his fears, when upon telling the
young gentleman, that the re&s;t of the company
were de&s;irous of departing for An$werp, he an|&s;wered,
they were at liberty to con&s;ult their own
melinations; but for his own part, he was re|&s;olved
to &s;tay in Bru&s;&s;els a few days longer. By
<PB N="206" REF="215">
this declaration, the governor was confirmed in
the opinion of his having &s;ome intrigue upon the
anvil; and in the bitterne&s;s of his vexation, took
the liberty of &s;ignifying his &s;u&s;picion, and re|minding
him of the dangerous dilemmas to which
he had been reduced by his former precipitation.</P>
<P>Peregrine took his caution in good part, and
promi&s;ed to behave with &s;uch circum&s;pection, as
would &s;creen him from any trouble&s;ome con&s;e|quences
for the future: but, neverthele&s;s, be|haved
that &s;ame evening in &s;uch a manner, as
plainly &s;hewed, that his prudence was nothing
el&s;e than vain &s;peculation. He had made an ap|pointment
to &s;pend the night, as u&s;ual, with
Mrs. Hornbeck; and about nine o'clock ha&s;tened
to her lodgings, when he was acco&s;ted in the
&s;treet by his old di&s;carded friend Thomas Pipes,
who, without any other preamble, told him, that
for all he had turned him adri&s;t, he did not choo&s;e
to &s;ee him run full &s;ail into his enemy's harbour,
without giving him timely notice of the danger.
&startq;I'll tell you what, (&s;aid he) mayhap you think
I want to curry favour, that I may be taken in
tow again; if you do, you have made a mi&s;take
in your reckoning. I am old enough to be laid
up, and have wherewithal to keep my planks
from the weather. But this here is the affair; I
have known you &s;ince you were no higher than
a marlin&s;pike, and &s;houldn't care to &s;ee you de|prived
of your carriages at the&s;e years: whereby
I am informed by Hornbeck's man, whom I this
afternoon fell in with by chance, as how his ma|&s;ter
has got intelligence of your boarding his
wife, and has &s;teer'd privately into this port, with
a large compliment of hands, in order, d'ye &s;ee,
to &s;ecure you while you are under the hatches,
<PB N="207" REF="216">
and cut away your tackle, without fear or mercy.
Now if &s;o be as how you have a mind to give
him a &s;alt eel for his &s;upper, here am I, without
hope of fee or reward, ready to &s;tand by you as
long as my timbers will &s;tick together; and if I
expect any recompence, may I be bound to eat
oakum and drink bilge-water for life.&endq;</P>
<P>Startled at this information, Peregrine exa|mined
him upon the particulars of his di&s;cour&s;e
with the lacquey; and when he under&s;tood that
Hornbeck's intelligence flowed from the canal of
his Flemi&s;h footman, he believed every circum|&s;tance
of Tom's report, thanked him for this
warning, and after having reprimanded him for
his mi&s;behaviour at Li&s;le, a&s;&s;ured him that it
&s;hould be his own fault if ever they &s;hould part
again. He then deliberated with him&s;elf whether
or not he &s;hould retort the purpo&s;e upon his ad|ver&s;ary;
but, when he con&s;idered that Hornbeck
was not the aggre&s;&s;or, and made that unhappy
hu&s;band's ca&s;e his own, he could not help ac|quitting
his intention of revenge; though, in his
opinion, it ought to have been executed in a more
honourable manner; and therefore he deter|mined
to cha&s;ti&s;e him for his want of &s;pirit. No|thing
&s;urely can be more in&s;olent and unju&s;t than
this determination, which induced him to puni&s;h
a per&s;on, for his want of courage to redre&s;s the
injury which he him&s;elf had done to his repu|tation
and peace; and yet this barbarity of deci|&s;ion
is &s;anctioned by the opinion and practice of
mankind.</P>
<P>With the&s;e &s;entiments he returned to the inn,
and putting a pair of pi&s;tols in his pocket, ordered
his valet de chambre and Pipes to follow him at a
&s;mall di&s;tance, &s;o as that they &s;hould be within
<PB N="208" REF="217">
call, in ca&s;e of nece&s;&s;ity, and po&s;ted him&s;elf within
thirty yards of his Dulcinea's door. There he
had not been above half an hour, when he per|ceived
four men take up their &s;tation on the other
&s;ide, with a view, as he gue&s;&s;ed, to watch for
his going in, that he might be taken unaware.
But when they had tarried a con&s;iderable time in
that corner, without reaping the fruits of their
expectation, their leader, per&s;uaded that the gal|lant
had gained admittance by &s;ome &s;ecret means,
approached the door with his followers, who,
according to the in&s;tructions they had received,
no &s;ooner &s;aw it opened, than they ru&s;hed in,
leaving their employer in the &s;treet, where he
thought his per&s;on would be lea&s;t endangered.
Our adventurer &s;eeing him alone, advanced with
&s;peed, and clapping a pi&s;tol to his brea&s;t, com|manded
him to follow his foot&s;teps, without noi&s;e,
on pain of immediate death.</P>
<P>Terrified at this &s;udden apparition, Hornbeck
obeyed in &s;ilence; and in a few minutes they ar|rived
at the quay, where Pickle halting, gave
him to under&s;tand, that he was no &s;tranger to
his villainous de&s;ign; and told him, that if he
conceived him&s;elf injured by any circum&s;tance of
his conduct, he would now give him an oppor|tunity
of re&s;enting the wrong, in a manner be|coming
a man of honour. &startq;You have a &s;word
about you, (&s;aid he) or if you don't choo&s;e to
put the affair on that i&s;&s;ue, here is a brace of
pi&s;tols, take which you plea&s;e.&endq; Such an addre&s;s
could not fail to di&s;concert a man of his cha|racter.
After &s;ome he&s;itation, he in a faultering
accent denied that his de&s;ign was to mutilate
Mr. Pickle, but that he thought him&s;elf intitled
to the benefit of the law, by which he would
<PB N="209" REF="218">
have obtained a divorce, if he could have pro|cured
evidence of his wife's infidelity; and with
that view had employed people to take advantage
of the information he had received. With re|gard
to his alternative, he declined it intirely, be|cau&s;e
he could not &s;ee what &s;atisfaction he &s;hould
enjoy, in being &s;hot through the head, or run
through the lungs, by a per&s;on who had already
wronged him in an irreparable manner; and
la&s;tly, his fear made him propo&s;e, that the affair
&s;hould be left to the arbitration of two creditable
men, altogether unconcerned in the di&s;pute.</P>
<P>To the&s;e remon&s;trances, Peregrine replied, in
the &s;tile of a hot-headed young man, con&s;cious
of his own unju&s;tifiable behaviour, that every
gentleman ought to be a judge of his own ho|nour;
and therefore he would &s;ubmit to the de|ci&s;ion
of no umpire what &s;oever; that he would
forgive his want of courage, which might be a
natural infirmity, but his mean di&s;&s;imulation he
could not pardon; and that, as he was certified
of the ra&s;cally intent of his ambu&s;cade, by un|doubted
intelligence, he would treat him, not
with a retaliation of his own treachery, but with
&s;uch indignity as a &s;coundrel de&s;erves to &s;uffer;
unle&s;s he would make one effort to maintain the
character he a&s;&s;umed in life: &s;o &s;aying, he again
pre&s;ented his pi&s;tol, which being rejected as be|fore,
he called his two mini&s;ters, and ordered
them to duck him in the canal.</P>
<P>This command was pronounced and executed
almo&s;t in the &s;ame breath, to the un&s;peakable
terror and di&s;order of the poor &s;hivering patient,
who, having undergone the immer&s;ion, ran about
like a drowned rat, &s;queaking for a&s;&s;i&s;tance and
revenge. His cries were overheard by the pa|trole,
<PB N="210" REF="219">
which, chancing to pa&s;s that way, took
him under their protection, and, in con&s;equence
of his complaint and information, went in pur|&s;uit
of our adventurer and his attendants, who
were &s;oon overtaken and &s;urrounded. Ra&s;h and
incon&s;iderate as the young gentleman was, he
did not pretend to &s;tand upon the defen&s;ive, a|gain&s;t
a file of mu&s;keteers, although Pipes had
drawn his cutla&s;s at their approach, but &s;urren|dered
him&s;elf without oppo&s;ition, and was con|veyed
to the main guard, where the command|ing
officer, engaged by his appearance and ad|dre&s;s,
treated him with all imaginable re&s;pect,
and hearing the particulars of his adventure, a&s;|&s;ured
him, that the prince would con&s;ider the
whole as a <HI>Tour de jeune&s;&s;e,</HI> and order him to be
relea&s;ed without delay.</P>
<P>Next morning, when this gentleman gave in
his report, he made &s;uch a favourable repre&s;enta|tion
of the pri&s;oner, that our hero was on the
point of being di&s;charged; when Hornbeck pre|ferred
a complaint, accu&s;ing him of a purpo&s;ed
a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination, and praying that &s;uch puni&s;hment
&s;hould be inflicted upon him, as his highne&s;s
&s;hould think adequate to the nature of the crime.
The prince, perplexed with this petition, in con|&s;equence
of which he fore&s;aw, that he mu&s;t di&s;|oblige
a Briti&s;h &s;ubject, &s;ent for the plaintiff, of
whom he had &s;ome knowledge, and in per&s;on ex|horted
him to drop the pro&s;ecution, which would
only &s;erve to propagate his own &s;hame. But
Hornbeck was too much incen&s;ed to li&s;ten to any
propo&s;al of that kind, and peremptorily demand|ed
ju&s;tice again&s;t the pri&s;oner, whom he repre|&s;ented
as an ob&s;cure adventurer, who had made
repeated attempts upon his honour and his life.
<PB N="211" REF="220">
Prince Charles told him, that what he had ad|vi&s;ed
was in the capacity of a friend, but, &s;ince
he in&s;i&s;ted upon his acting as a magi&s;trate, the
affair &s;hould be examined, and determined ac|cording
to the dictates of ju&s;tice and truth.</P>
<P>The petitioner being di&s;mi&s;&s;ed with this pro|mi&s;e,
the defendant was in his turn brought be|fore
the judge, who&s;e prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion in his favour,
was in a great mea&s;ure weakened by what his an|tagoni&s;t
had &s;aid to the prejudice of his birth and
reputation.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. LXV.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Peregrine is relea&s;ed. Jolter confounded at his
my&s;terious conduct. A conte&s;t happens between
the poet and painter, who are reconciled by the
mediation of their fellow travellers.</HEAD>
<P>OUR hero, under&s;tanding from &s;ome expre&s;|&s;ions
which e&s;caped the prince, that he was
con&s;idered in the light of a &s;harper and a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in,
begged that he might have the liberty of &s;ending
for &s;ome vouchers, that would probably vindicate
his character from the malicious a&s;per&s;ions of his
adver&s;ary; and this permi&s;&s;ion being granted, he
wrote a letter to his governor, de&s;iring that he
would bring to him the letters of recommenda|tion
which he had received from the Briti&s;h em|ba&s;&s;ador
at Paris, and &s;uch other papers as he
thought conducive to evince the importance of
his &s;ituation.</P>
<P>The billet was given in charge to one of the
&s;ubaltern officers on duty, who carried it to the
inn, and demanded to &s;peak with Mr. Jolter&punc;
Pallet, who happened to be at the door, when
<PB N="212" REF="221">
this me&s;&s;enger arrived, and heard him enquire for
the tutor, ran directly to that gentleman's apart|ment,
and in manife&s;t di&s;order told him, that a
huge fellow of a &s;oldier, with a mon&s;trous pair
of whi&s;kers, and a fur-cap as big as a bu&s;hel, was
a&s;king for him at the door. The poor governor
began to &s;hake at this intimation, though he was
not con&s;cious of having committed any thing
that could attract the attention of the &s;tate; and,
when the officer appeared at his chamber-door,
his confu&s;ion increa&s;ed to &s;uch a degree, that his
perception &s;eemed to vani&s;h, and the &s;ubaltern
repeated the purport of his errand three times,
before he could comprehend his meaning, or
venture to receive the letter which he pre&s;ented.
At length, however, he &s;ummoned all his forti|tude,
and having peru&s;ed the epi&s;tle, his terror
&s;unk into anxiety; his ingenious fear immediately
&s;ugge&s;ted, that Peregrine was confined in a dun|geon,
for &s;ome outrage he had committed; he
ran with great agitation to a trunk, and taking
out a bundle of papers, followed his conductor,
being attended by the painter, to whom he had
hinted his apprehen&s;ion. When they pa&s;&s;ed
through the guard, which was under arms, the
hearts of both died within them; and when they
came into the pre&s;ence, there was &s;uch an ex|pre&s;&s;ion
of awful horror on the countenance of
Jolter, that the prince, ob&s;erving his di&s;may, was
plea&s;ed to encourage him with an a&s;&s;urance, that
he had nothing to fear. Thus comforted, he re|collected
him&s;elf &s;o well as to under&s;tand his pu|pil,
when he de&s;ired him to produce the Emba&s;|&s;ador's
letters; &s;ome of which being open, were
immediately read by his highne&s;s, who was per|&s;onally
acquainted with the writer, and knew
<PB N="213" REF="222">
&s;everal of the noblemen to whom they were ad|dre&s;&s;ed.
The&s;e recommendations were &s;o warm,
and repre&s;ented the young gentleman in &s;uch an
advantageous light, that the prince, convinced of
the inju&s;tice his character had &s;uffered by the
mi&s;repre&s;entation of Hornbeck, took our hero by
the hand, a&s;ked pardon for the doubts he had
entertained of his honour, declared him from that
moment at liberty, ordered his dome&s;ticks to be
enlarged, and offered him his countenance and
protection, as long as he &s;hould remain in the
Au&s;trian Netherlands. At the &s;ame time, he
cautioned him again&s;t indi&s;cretion in the cour&s;e
of his gallantries; and took his word and honour,
that he &s;hould drop all mea&s;ures of re&s;entment
again&s;t the per&s;on of Hornbeck, during his re&s;i|dence
in that place.</P>
<P>The delinquent, thus honourably acquitted,
thanked the prince in the mo&s;t re&s;pectful man|ner,
for his genero&s;ity and candour, and retired
with his two friends, who were amazed and be|wildered
in their thoughts, at what they had &s;een
and heard, the whole adventure &s;till remaining
without the &s;phere of their comprehen&s;ion, which
was not at all enlarged by the unaccountable ap|pearance
of Pipes, who, with the valet de cham|bre,
joined them at the ca&s;tle-gate. Had Jolter
been a man of a luxuriant imagination, his brain
would undoubtedly have &s;uffered in the inve&s;ti|gation
of his pupil's my&s;terious conduct, which
he &s;trove in vain to unravel; but his intellects
were too &s;olid to be affected by the mi&s;carriage
of his invention; and as Peregrine did not think
proper to make him acquainted with the cau&s;e of
his being apprehended, he contented him&s;elf with
&s;uppo&s;ing, that there was a lady in the ca&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="214" REF="223">
The painter, who&s;e imagination was of a more
flim&s;y texture, formed a thou&s;and chimerical
conjectures, which he communicated to Pickle,
in imperfect in&s;inuations, hoping, by his an&s;wers
and behaviour, to di&s;cover the truth; but the
youth, in order to tantalize him, eluded all his
enquiries, with &s;uch appearance of indu&s;try and
art, as heightened his curio&s;ity, while it di&s;ap|pointed
his aim, and inflamed him to &s;uch a de|gree
of impatience, that his wits began to be un|&s;ettled,
and Peregrine was fain to recompo&s;e his
brain, by telling him in confidence, that he had
been arre&s;ted as a &s;py. This &s;ecret he found
more intolerable than his former uncertainty; he
ran from one apartment to another, like a goo&s;e
in the agonies of egg-laying, with intention of
di&s;burdening this important load; but, Jolter be|ing
engaged with his pupil, and all the people of
the hou&s;e ignorant of the only language he could
&s;peak, he was compelled, with infinite reluctance,
to addre&s;s him&s;elf to the doctor, who was, at that
time, &s;hut up in his own chamber. Having knocked
at the door, to no purpo&s;e, he peeped through
the key-hole, and &s;aw the phy&s;ician &s;itting at a
table, with a pen in one hand, and paper before
him, his head reclined upon his other hand, and
his eyes fixed upon the ceiling, as if he had been
intranced. Pallet, concluding that he was under
the power of &s;ome convul&s;ion, endeavoured to
force the door open, and the noi&s;e of his efforts
recalled the doctor from his reverie. This poe|tical
republican, being &s;o di&s;agreeably di&s;turbed,
&s;tarted up in a pa&s;&s;ion, and opening the door, no
&s;ooner perceived who had interrupted him, than
he flung it in his face with great fury, and cur&s;ed
<PB N="215" REF="224">
him for his impertinent intru&s;ion, which had
deprived him of the mo&s;t delightful vi&s;ion that
ever regaled the human fancy. He imagined,
(as he afterwards imparted to Peregrine) that
as he enjoyed him&s;elf in walking though the
flowery plain that borders on Parna&s;&s;us, he was
met by a venerable &s;age, whom, by a certain
divine vivacity that lightened from his eyes,
he in&s;tantly knew to be the immortal Pindar.
He was immediately &s;truck with reverence and
awe, and pro&s;trated him&s;elf before the appari|tion,
which taking him by the hand, lifted him
gently from the ground; and with words more
&s;weet than the honey of the Hybla bees, told
him, that of all the moderns, he alone was vi&s;ited
by that cele&s;tial impul&s;e by which him&s;elf had
been in&s;pired, when he produced his mo&s;t ap|plauded
odes. So &s;aying, he led him up the
&s;acred hill, per&s;uaded him to drink a copious
draught of the waters of the Hippocrene, and
then pre&s;ented him to the harmonious nine, who
crowned his temples with a laurel-wreath.</P>
<P>No wonder then, that he was enraged to find
him&s;elf cut off from &s;uch &s;ublime &s;ociety. He
raved in Greek again&s;t the invader, who was &s;o
big with his own purpo&s;e, that, unmindful of the
di&s;grace he had &s;u&s;tained, and di&s;regarding all the
&s;ymptoms of the phy&s;ician's di&s;plea&s;ure, he ap|plied
his mouth to the door, and in eager tone,
&startq;I'll hold you any wager (&s;aid he) that I gue&s;s
the true cau&s;e of Mr. Pickle's impri&s;onment.&endq;
To this challenge he received no reply; and
therefore repeated it, adding, &startq;I &s;uppo&s;e you
imagine he was taken up for fighting a duel, or
affronting a nobleman, or lying with &s;ome man's
wife, or &s;ome &s;uch matter; but, agad! you was
<PB N="216" REF="225">
never more mi&s;taken in your life; and I'll lay
my Cleopatra again&s;t your Homer's head, that in
four and twenty hours you &s;han't light on the
true rea&s;on.&endq;</P>
<P>The favourite of the mu&s;es, exa&s;perated at this
vexatious per&s;everance of the painter, who he
imagined had come thither to teize and in&s;ult
him, &startq;I would (&s;aid he) &s;acrifice a cock to
AE&s;culapius, were I a&s;&s;ured that any per&s;on had
been taken up for extirpating &s;uch a trouble&s;ome
Goth as you are from the face of the earth; and
as for your boa&s;ted Cleopatra, which you &s;ay
was drawn from your own wife, I believe the
copy has as much of the <GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> as the original.
But, were it mine, it &s;hould be hung up in the
temple of Cloacina, as the picture of that god|de&s;s;
for any other apartment would be di&s;graced
by its appearance.&endq; &startq;Hark ye, Sir, (replied
Pallet, enraged in his turn at this contemptuous
mention of his darling performance) you may
make as free with my wife as you think proper;
but 'ware my works, tho&s;e are the children of
my fancy, conceived by the glowing imagina|tion,
and formed by the art of my own hands:
and you your&s;elf are a Goth, and a Turk, and
a Tartar, and an impudent pretending jack|anapes,
to treat with &s;uch di&s;re&s;pect a production
which, in the opinions of all the connoi&s;&s;eurs of
the age, will, when fini&s;hed, be a ma&s;ter-piece
in its kind, and do honour to human genius and
&s;kill. So I &s;ay again and again, (and I care
not though your friend Playtor heard me) that
you have no more ta&s;te than a drayman's hor&s;e,
and that tho&s;e fooli&s;h notions of the ancients
ought to be drubb'd out of you with a good
cudgel, that you might learn to treat men of parts
<PB N="217" REF="226">
with more veneration. Perhaps you may not al|ways
be in the company of one who will hollow
for a&s;&s;i&s;tance, when you are on the brink of be|ing
cha&s;ti&s;ed for your in&s;olence, as I did, when
you brought upon your&s;elf the re&s;entment of that
Scot, who, by the Lard! would have paid you
both &s;cot and lot, as Fal&s;taf &s;ays, if the French
officer had not put him in arre&s;t.&endq;</P>
<P>The phy&s;ician to this declamation, which was
conveyed through the key-hole, an&s;wered, that
he (the painter) was a fellow &s;o infinitely below
his con&s;ideration, that his con&s;cience upbraided
him with no action of his life, except that of
choo&s;ing &s;uch a wretch for his companion and
fellow-traveller. That he had viewed his cha|racter
through the medium of good nature and
compa&s;&s;ion, which had prompted him to give
Pallet an opportunity of acquiring &s;ome new ideas
under his immediate in&s;truction; but he had
abu&s;ed his goodne&s;s and conde&s;cen&s;ion in &s;uch a
flagrant manner, that he was now determined to
di&s;card him intirely from his acquaintance, and
de&s;ired him, for the pre&s;ent, to take him&s;elf
away, on pain of being kicked for his pre&s;ump|tion.</P>
<P>Pallet was too much incen&s;ed to be intimidated
by this threat, which he retorted with great viru|l$nce,
defying him to come forth, that it might
appear which of them was be&s;t &s;killed in that pe|de&s;trian
exerci&s;e which he immediately began to
practi&s;e again&s;t the door with &s;uch thundering ap|plication,
as reached the ears of Pickle and his go|vernor,
who coming out into the pa&s;&s;age, and
&s;eeing him thus employed, a&s;ked if he had forgot
the chamber-pots of Alo&s;t, that he ventured to
<PB N="218" REF="227">
behave in &s;uch a manner, as intitled him to a &s;e|cond
pre&s;cription of the &s;ame nature.</P>
<P>The doctor under&s;tanding that there was com|pany
at hand, opened the door in a twinkling,
and &s;pringing upon his antagoni&s;t, like a tyger, a
fierce contention would have en&s;ued, to the in|finite
&s;atisfaction of our hero, had not Jolter, to
the manife&s;t peril of his own per&s;on, interpo&s;ed,
and partly by force, and partly by exhortations,
put a &s;top to the engagement before it was fairly
begun. After having demon&s;trated the indecency
of &s;uch a vulgar rencounter betwixt two fellow-citizens
in a foreign land, he begg'd to know the
cau&s;e of their di&s;&s;ention, and offered his good of|fices
towards an accommodation. Peregrine al&s;o,
&s;eeing the fray was fini&s;hed, expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to
the &s;ame purpo&s;e; and the painter, for obvious
rea&s;ons, declining an explanation, his antagoni&s;t
told the youth what a mortifying interruption he
had &s;uffered by the impertinent intru&s;ion of Pal|let,
and gave him a detail of the particulars of his
vi&s;ion, as above recited. The arbiter owned, the
provocation was not to be endured, and decreed,
that the offender &s;hould make &s;ome atonement
for his tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion. Upon which the painter ob|&s;erved,
that how&s;oever he might have been di&s;|po&s;ed
to make acknowledgments, if the phy&s;ician
had &s;ignified his di&s;plea&s;ure like a gentleman, the
complainant had now forfeited all claim to any
&s;uch conce&s;&s;ions, by the vulgar manner in which
he had reviled him and his productions; ob&s;erving,
that if he (the painter) had been inclined to re|tort
his &s;landerous in&s;inuations, the republican's
own works would have afforded ample &s;ubject for
his ridicule and cen&s;ure.</P>
<P><PB N="219" REF="228">
After divers di&s;putes and repre&s;entations, peace
was at length concluded, on condition, that for
the future the doctor &s;hould never mention Cleo|patra,
unle&s;s he could &s;ay &s;omething in her prai&s;e;
and that Pallet, in con&s;ideration of his having
been the fir&s;t aggre&s;&s;or, &s;hould make a &s;ketch of

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Peregrine renews his inquiries about his lo&s;t Amanda,
in the cour&s;e of which he is engaged in an in|trigue
with a nun, which produces &s;trange con&s;e|quences.</HEAD>
<P>THOUGH this treaty was concluded at
the in&s;tances of Peregrine and his gover|nor,
it was impo&s;&s;ible that a la&s;ting friend&s;hip
could &s;ub&s;i&s;t between the two parties, becau&s;e
they entertained for each other the mo&s;t perfect
contempt, which, in the cour&s;e of their commu|nication,
could not fail to mini&s;ter daily food for
animo&s;ity and aver&s;ion.</P>
<P>Our adventurer's next care was to exerci&s;e all
his diligence and invention to find his lo&s;t Amanda,
who, now that he was detached from Mrs. Horn|beck,
re&s;umed the full po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his thoughts.
As &s;he would never tell him her own name, or
that of her mother, his inquiries were directed by
a per&s;onal de&s;cription only; and that, in &s;uch a
populous city as Bru&s;&s;els, could tend but very
little to his &s;atisfaction. He not only ordered his
valet de chambre to exert his whole addre&s;s, in
order to di&s;cover the place of her abode, but this
dexterous mini&s;ter, who was very well acquainted
in that city, retained half a dozen of noted pimps
<PB N="220" REF="229">
for the &s;ame purpo&s;e, who were directed to em|ploy
their re&s;earches for a very hand&s;ome young
lady, of the middle &s;tature, with fine black eyes,
and teeth as white as &s;now, a native of Bru&s;&s;els,
though married to a French gentleman, and lately
arrived from her hu&s;band's hou&s;e on a vi&s;it to her
mother, who was dangerou&s;ly ill.</P>
<P>Thus in&s;tructed, they put them&s;elves in mo|tion,
while the lover in per&s;on frequented the
court, the opera, the churches, public walks, and
every place where he thought there was the lea&s;t
probability of &s;eeing her. The de&s;cription his
Mercury had given to the under&s;trappers of gal|lantry,
in a good mea&s;ure &s;uited &s;everal ladies in
town, whom Peregrine found means to &s;ee, in
con&s;equence of the reports he had received; but
he could not recognize his dear fellow-traveller
among the number. At la&s;t one of his terriers
gave the valet de chambre to under&s;tand, that at
the grate of a certain nunnery, he had ob&s;erved
a beautiful young creature, who re&s;embled the
picture he had drawn, and that upon inquiry, he
found &s;he had not taken the veil; but her mother
being lately dead, had entered as a pen&s;ionaire,
until her family-affairs could be adju&s;ted.</P>
<P>This piece of intelligence was no &s;ooner com|municated
to our hero, than he flew in the ut|mo&s;t
impatience to the nunnery, and, without al|lowing
him&s;elf to believe that this boarder could
be any other than the object of his pur&s;uit, de|&s;ired
the portre&s;s to tell the young lady who was
lately admitted, that one of her relations begg'd
to &s;peak with her at the grate. He had not waited
five minutes, when this nymph appeared; and
though he found his expectation di&s;appointed, he
was &s;o &s;truck with the charms of this new figure,
<PB N="221" REF="230">
that his heart throbbed when &s;he approached;
and after he had a&s;ked pardon for the liberty he
had taken, and explained the nature of his mi|&s;take,
he could not help telling her, that he
thought him&s;elf fortunate in the mi&s;information
he had received, &s;ince it was attended with the
plea&s;ure of &s;eeing &s;uch an amiable young lady.
To this compliment &s;he replied with great &s;pirit
and good humour, that encouraged the youth to
continue the conver&s;ation, during which he pro|fe&s;&s;ed
him&s;elf her admirer; and when, for the
&s;ake of decorum, he was obliged to take his leave,
earne&s;tly begg'd he might be allow'd to repeat his
vi&s;it: and having obtained this permi&s;&s;ion, and
the knowledge of her name, returned to his lodg|ings
in full confidence of bringing this intrigue to
a pro&s;perous i&s;&s;ue.</P>
<P>Nor had the young gentleman in this ca&s;e over-rated
his own &s;ucce&s;s: the lady happened to be
of a very amorous complexion, and her pa&s;&s;ions
being inflamed rather than mortified, by the re|&s;tramt
in which &s;he lived, &s;he was captivated by
the per&s;on of Peregrine, and his in&s;inuating ad|dre&s;s
had confirmed his conque&s;t. He did not fail
to be at the grate next day, where he urged his
&s;uit with &s;uch irre&s;i&s;tible recommendations, that
&s;he confe&s;&s;ed a mutual flame, after having ob|&s;erved,
that the circum&s;tances of her &s;ituation
would not permit her to protract that acknow|ledgment
in the u&s;ual form. He received this
confe&s;&s;ion with tran&s;port, as the effu&s;ion of an
ingenuous mind, that &s;oars above all the little arts
and di&s;gui&s;es of the &s;ex; and intreated her to tell
him when or where he &s;hould have the happine&s;s
of conver&s;ing with her, without the interpo&s;ition
of the&s;e invidious bars.</P>
<P><PB N="222" REF="231">
She gave him to under&s;tand, that as her friends
had put her under the direction of a &s;evere ab|be&s;s,
it would be impo&s;&s;ible for her to go abroad
without the connivance of the portre&s;s, and
equally impracticable for him to gain admittance
into the convent, without running a manife&s;t ri&s;k
of being di&s;covered, and con&s;equently puni&s;hed
with the utmo&s;t &s;everity.</P>
<P>When a fair lady was in the ca&s;e, our adven|turer
de&s;pi&s;ed all danger, and &s;pared no expence.
Thus informed, he &s;tudied the di&s;po&s;ition of the
old &s;i&s;ter who kept the keys; and in her appear|ance
and conver&s;ation, di&s;tingui&s;hed the impla|cable
rancour of a woman who had &s;pent her
youth in all the mortification of dete&s;ted celibacy.
She bore a mo&s;t inveterate grudge to all her ju|$$ors,
who &s;till remained within the po&s;&s;ibility of
enjoying tho&s;e plea&s;ures from which &s;he was eter|nal$y
cut off, and ob&s;erved all the young men
who appeared at the grate with the mo&s;t envious
&s;u&s;picion. Not even the power of all-per&s;uading
gold could tame the &s;pite, or &s;often the vigilant
a&s;perity of this indomitable maiden.</P>
<P>Our lover tampered with her in vain; nay,
&s;he threatened to inform the abbe&s;s of his &s;acri|legious
attempt, that he might, for the future,
be excluded from the privilege of &s;peaking to the
nuns: and, for the fir&s;t time, he found the art
of corruption ineffectual. Baffled in this endea|vour,
he conferred with his mi&s;tre&s;s about &s;ome
other means of procuring an unre&s;tricted inter|view;
and &s;he, in the fertility of her invention,
propo&s;ed, that he &s;hould make it his bu&s;ine&s;s to
find &s;ome woman, who, by her acquaintance in
the convent, would introduce him in a female
dre&s;s, as a &s;tranger de&s;irous of &s;eeing the oeconomy
<PB N="223" REF="232">
of the hou&s;e. The expedient was wonderfully
reli&s;hed by the gallant, who had immediate re|cour&s;e
to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of his valet de chambre,
by whom he was next day made acquainted with
a certain good-natured gentlewoman, who, for
an hand&s;ome con&s;ideration, undertook the ta&s;k.
From this good lady's wardrobe he was accord|ingly
accommodated with a proper &s;uit, which,
on account of his &s;tature, was pieced for the pur|po&s;e:
and his mi&s;tre&s;s being previou&s;ly prepared
with the knowledge of their intention, he &s;et out
in the afternoon with his conductre&s;s, who had
intere&s;t enough to obtain his admi&s;&s;ion, on pre|tence
of his being an Engli&s;h lady, ju&s;t arrived
from her own country, and curious to &s;ee the me|nage
and accommodations of a nunnery. Though
the alteration of his dre&s;s, and a pair of artificial
eye-brows, &s;creened him from the penetrating
eye of the portre&s;s, there was &s;omething &s;o re|markably
&s;ingular in his make, &s;tature, counte|nance
and mien, that the &s;i&s;ters gazed upon him
as a prodigy; and he could hear them, as he
pa&s;&s;ed, a&s;king of each other, with expre&s;&s;ions of
a&s;toni&s;hment, if all the women in England made
&s;uch a &s;trange appearance.</P>
<P>Having vi&s;ited the cells and chapel, his charmer
officiou&s;ly offered her &s;ervice in conducting the
&s;tranger to the garden; and after having attended
them in walking &s;everal turns, invited them to
repo&s;e in a &s;mall arbour, that &s;tood at one corner,
in the middle of a tu&s;t of trees, which rendered it
impervious to the view. The old gentlewoman
under&s;tanding the hint, accompanied the lovers
to the entrance of this grove, where &s;he left
them, on pretence of being &s;till unwearied with
the exerci&s;e of her legs; and their mutual raptures
<PB N="224" REF="233">
in this &s;tolen interview began to ri&s;e to a very
intere&s;ting pitch, when they were alarmed by the
ru&s;tling of the leaves behind them; and turning
their eyes towards the place, perceived they were
di&s;covered by a nun, who, either by accident or
de&s;ign, had concealed her&s;elf in the thicket, until,
&s;candalized by their behaviour, &s;he thought it
high time to &s;ignify her pre&s;ence.</P>
<P>It is not to be doubted that our hero and his
mi&s;tre&s;s were grievou&s;ly di&s;concerted on this oc|ca&s;ion.
The lady cried &s;he was undone, and had
almo&s;t fainted with fear, which was not at all
without foundation, con&s;idering that not only
her reputation, but even her life was at &s;take.
Peregrine, though he could ea&s;ily have made his
e&s;cape over the garden-wall, had too much gal|lantry
to leave his charmer and friend in &s;uch a
dangerous dilemma; and therefore, with ad|mirable
pre&s;ence of mind, advanced to the au|thor
of his perplexity, and without any cere|mony
or court&s;hip, found means to make her a
party in the &s;ecret, before &s;he could recollect her|&s;elf
&s;o far as to find fault with his proceeding.</P>
<P>This mea&s;ure re-e&s;tabli&s;hed the tranquillity of
the &s;cene: the two ladies embraced as &s;i&s;ters, and
vowed eternal friend&s;hip on the &s;pot; and the
young gentleman having prote&s;ted that he would
&s;hare his affection between them, and practi&s;e
the &s;ame method of vi&s;iting them in a few days,
rejoined his directre&s;s, and returned in &s;afety to
his own lodgings, being but indifferently &s;atisfied
with the adventure of the day, by which he found
him&s;elf obliged, either to forego all corre&s;pon|dence
with the woman he loved, or carry on an
intrigue with a per&s;on who was not at all to his
<PB N="225" REF="234">
liking; for the attractions of the nun were by no
means inchanting.</P>
<P>He next day appeared at the grate in his own
per&s;on, and intimated his &s;entiments on this &s;ubject
to his mi&s;tre&s;s, who a&s;&s;ured him, that notwith|&s;tanding
her behaviour to the &s;i&s;ter, in the emer|gency
of ye&s;terday, &s;he would much rather be de|barred
of his company for ever, than enjoy it
upon the terms which nece&s;&s;ity had obliged him
to propo&s;e. She &s;aid, the reflection on what had
pa&s;&s;ed in the grove, had in&s;pired her with &s;uch
an unconquerable aver&s;ion for that accidental ri|val,
that &s;he could not think of her without hate
and indignation. She wi&s;hed &s;he had run all
ri&s;ks, rather than &s;ubmit to &s;uch dete&s;ted partition;
and vowed with great warmth, that let the con|&s;equence
be what it would, &s;he was determined
to di&s;cover the whole affair to the abbe&s;s, if ever
he &s;hould introduce him&s;elf again, in a manner
which mu&s;t &s;ubject him to the knowledge and
claim of her competitor.</P>
<P>He applauded the delicacy of her &s;entiments,
which he &s;wore were exactly conformable to his
own; and promi&s;ed to de&s;i&s;t from tho&s;e vi&s;its that
gave her umbrage, encouraging her to hope, that
they would find &s;ome other means of &s;ettling an
intercour&s;e, in which &s;he &s;hould ingro&s;s his un|divided
attention. Such a &s;cheme was actually
the &s;ubject of his thoughts at that time; and a
youth of his fruitful imagination, a&s;&s;i&s;ted with the
coun&s;els of &s;uch a con&s;ummate politician as the
valet de chambre, would undoubtedly have brought
it to maturation, had not his aim been anticipated
by an unfore&s;een accident, that flowed from the
partial admini&s;tration of his favour. The nun
who had been indebted to chance for his addre&s;&s;es,
<PB N="226" REF="235">
was too con&s;cious of her own inferior qualifica|tions,
to think &s;he could di&s;pute the heart of our
hero with the young lady who was previou&s;ly
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of his affection; &s;he knew, that her
&s;hare of his good graces was altogether ca&s;ual,
and that the continuance of his a&s;&s;iduities mu&s;t
be the effect of policy and con&s;trained complai|&s;ance;
yet, even on the&s;e con&s;iderations, they were
too agreeable to be given up; and therefore &s;he
re&s;olved to guard her privilege with the mo&s;t mi|nute
vigilance and caution. Jealou&s;y was the
natural con&s;equence of the&s;e &s;ugge&s;tions: the a&s;|&s;ignation
in the garden, &s;he knew, mu&s;t have been
preceded by &s;ome communication; and as there was
no other opportunity of conver&s;ing with the male
&s;ex, except that of holding a conference through
the grate, &s;he went to the portre&s;s, with a view
of obtaining &s;ome intelligence; and pumped the
beldame &s;o &s;ucce&s;sfully, that &s;he learnt how her
rival had that very forenoon been favoured with a
vi&s;it by a young gentleman, whom &s;he &s;uppo&s;ed
to be no other than their common gallant. In|flamed
with this information, &s;he taxed the young
lady with double dealing; and &s;colded with &s;uch bit|terne&s;s,
that the other, already prejudiced again&s;t
her preten&s;ions, could no longer contain her re|&s;entment,
which &s;he uttered in contemptuous
&s;neers again&s;t her per&s;onal attributes; and in the
pride of her wrath declared, that &s;he ought not
to expect another interview with her lover in the
grove; for he was already too much &s;atiated with
her charms to return to &s;uch a banquet, and had
rel$nqui&s;hed her to the chance of meeting with
another charitable meal.</P>
<P>No tygre&s;s $obbed of her young was ever ex|alted
to an $$gher pitch of &s;ury than this nun,
<PB N="227" REF="236">
when &s;he found her&s;elf abandoned by her lover,
and in&s;ulted in this mortifying explanation. She
darted upon her antagoni&s;t, like a hawk upon a
partridge, and with her nails disfigured that fair
face which had defrauded her of her deare&s;t ex|pectation.
Nor did the rival tamely bear the
barbarity of her rage; what &s;he wanted in &s;trength
&s;he &s;upplied with &s;pirit, and twi&s;ting her hand in
the hair of the aggre&s;&s;or, pulled her head with
violence to the ground. The noi&s;e of this con|tention,
increa&s;ed by the cries of the combatants,
who&s;e tongues were more active than their hands,
brought a croud of &s;i&s;ters to the &s;pot; but &s;o
fiercely were they engaged, that they neither
minded admonitions nor threats, nor paid the
lea&s;t regard to their own reputation; but on the
contrary, as if they had not known that they
were &s;urrounded by numbers, who heard every
word that proceeded from their mouths, they
made no &s;ecret of the cau&s;e of their di&s;pute, which,
in the precipitancy of their wrath, they divulged
with all its circum&s;tances, to the amazement of
the by-&s;tanders.</P>
<P>At length the lady abbe&s;s arrived, and what
her authority could not accompli&s;h, was effected
by two lay-&s;i&s;ters, who being &s;ummoned for the
purpo&s;e, &s;eparated the rivals, who were by this
time quite exhau&s;ted with the fatigue of the battle.
Had this mutual detection been made in any
company of females, the &s;ecret would have
hardly re&s;ted among tho&s;e who heard it, much le&s;s
in a convent, where &s;o many old maidens hap|pened
to be pre&s;ent. One of the&s;e antiquated de|votees
accordingly imparted it to the &s;uperior,
who having examined into the particulars, and
found the information true, from the ra&s;h recri|mination
<PB N="228" REF="237">
of the incen&s;ed parties on their trial,
con&s;idered the affair as a very &s;erious matter,
which affected the good order and reputation of
her convent, a&s;&s;embled all the &s;i&s;ters, and ex|horted
them to &s;uppre&s;s the di&s;covery, as a cir|cum&s;tance
injurious to the character of the hou&s;e;
laid &s;trict injunctions on the portre&s;s, to be very
cautious for the future in the di&s;charge of her of|fice,
delivered over the back&s;liding nun to a &s;e|vere
penance pre&s;cribed by her gho&s;tly father, and
that very day &s;ent her boarder back to her rela|tions,
with a hint of what had happened, and
an advice to di&s;po&s;e of her in &s;ome remote nun|nery,
where &s;he would be le&s;s expo&s;ed to the ma|chinations
of her gallant.</P>
<P>Our lover, utterly ignorant of this unlucky
fray and its con&s;equence, was confounded when
the wrinkled turnkey refu&s;ed to admit him to the
grate, telling him, that his impious contrivance
had come to light; that the lewd young woman,
for who&s;e &s;ake he had been guilty of &s;uch a flagrant
crime, was bani&s;hed from the convent; and that
if ever he &s;hould make another attempt to di&s;turb
the tranquillity of their retreat, a formal com|plaint
would be preferred again&s;t him to the civil
magi&s;trate.</P>
<P>Thunder&s;truck with this reception, he did not
think proper to advance any thing in his own
vindication, but retreated with all convenient di&s;|patch,
not ill plea&s;ed at the i&s;&s;ue of an adventure
which might have proved not only di&s;agreeable,
but cangerous in the highe&s;t degree. He at once
conjectured, that the mutual jealou&s;y of the la|dies
had betrayed the intrigue; and imagined,
that now his charmer was delivered from the re|&s;trictions
of a convent, &s;he would be more ac|ce&s;&s;ible
<PB N="229" REF="238">
to his endeavours. On this &s;uppo&s;ition,
he &s;ent his couriers upon the &s;cout; and as he
knew her name, it was not long before he learnt,
from their artful inquiries, that immediately after
her di&s;mi&s;&s;ion from one nunnery, &s;he had been
entered in another at Ghent, in con&s;equence of
the &s;uperior's advice, and in all likelihood would
be compelled to take the veil by her guardians,
who were remarkably zealous for the welfare of
her &s;oul.</P>

<PB N="230" REF="239">
junctures, he could not help believing him|&s;elf
derived, becau&s;e his own pencil adopted the
manner of that great man with &s;urpri&s;ing facility,
and his face wanted nothing but a pair of
whi&s;kers and a beard to exhibit the expre&s;s image
of the Fleming's countenance. He told them,
he was &s;o proud of this re&s;emblance, that in order
to render it more &s;triking, he had at one time of his
life re&s;olved to keep his face &s;acred from the razor;
and in that purpo&s;e had per&s;evered, notwith&s;tand|ing
the continual reprehen&s;ions of Mrs. Pallet,
who being then with child, &s;aid, his a&s;pect was
&s;o hideous, that &s;he dreaded a mi&s;carriage every
hour, until &s;he threatened, in plain terms, to
di&s;pute the &s;anity of his intellects, and apply to
the chancellor for a committee.</P>
<P>The doctor on this occa&s;ion ob&s;erved, that a
man who is not proof again&s;t the &s;olicitations of
a woman, can never expect to make a great fi|gure
in life; that painters and poets ought to cul|tivate
no wives but the mu&s;es; or if they are, by
the accidents of fortune, incumbered with fami|lies,
they &s;hould carefully guard again&s;t that per|nicious
weakne&s;s, fal&s;ely honoured with the ap|pellation
of <HI>natural affection,</HI> and pay no manner
of regard to the impertinent cu&s;toms of the world,
&startq;Granting that you had been for a &s;hort time
deemed a lunatic, (&s;aid he) you might have ac|quitted
your&s;elf honourably of that imputation,
by &s;ome performance that would have rai&s;ed your
character above all cen&s;ure. Sophocles him&s;elf,
that celebrated tragic poet, who for the &s;weetne&s;s
of his ver&s;i&s;ication, was &s;tiled <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, or <HI>the bee,</HI>
in his old age &s;uffered the &s;ame accu&s;ation from
his own children, who &s;eeing him neglect his
family affairs, and devote him&s;elf intirely to poe|try,
<PB N="231" REF="240">
carried him before the magi&s;trate, as a man
who&s;e intellects were &s;o much impaired by the
infirmities of age, that he was no longer fit to
manage his dome&s;tic concerns; upon which the
reverend bard produced his tragedy of <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">,
as a work he had ju&s;t fini&s;hed; which
being peru&s;ed, in&s;tead of being declared un&s;ound
of under&s;tanding, he was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed with admira|tion
and applau&s;e. I wi&s;h your beard and whi&s;kers
had been &s;anctioned by the like authority; though
I am afraid you would have been in the predica|ment
of tho&s;e di&s;ciples of a certain philo&s;opher,
who drank decoctions of cummin-&s;eeds, that their
faces might adopt the palene&s;s of their ma&s;ter's
complexion, hoping, that in being as wan, they
would be as learned as their teacher.&endq; The
painter, &s;tung with this &s;arca&s;m, replied, &startq;or
like tho&s;e Virtuo&s;i, who by repeating Greek, eat|ing
fillikickaby, and pretending to &s;ee vi&s;ions,
think they equal the ancients in ta&s;te and genius.&endq;
The phy&s;ician retorted, Pallet rejoined, and the
altercation continued, until they entered the gates
of Antwerp, when the admirer of Rubens broke
forth into a rapturous exclamation, which put an
end to the di&s;pute, and attracted the notice of
the inhabitants, many of whom, by &s;hrugging up
their &s;houlders, and pointing to their foreheads,
gave &s;hrewd indications, that they believed him a
poor gentleman di&s;ordered in his brain.</P>
<P>They had no &s;ooner alighted at the inn, than
this p&s;eudo-enthu&s;ia&s;t propo&s;ed to vi&s;it the great
church, in which he had been informed &s;ome of
his ma&s;ter's pieces were to be &s;een; and was re|markably
chagrined, when he under&s;tood that he
could not be admitted till next day. He ro&s;e next
morning by day-break, and di&s;turbed his fellow-travellers
<PB N="232" REF="241">
in &s;uch a noi&s;y and clamorous manner,
that Peregrine determined to puni&s;h him with
&s;ome new infliction, and while he put on his
cloaths, actually formed the plan of promoting
a duel between him and the doctor; in the ma|nagement
of which he promi&s;ed him&s;elf &s;tore of
entertainment, from the behaviour of both.</P>
<P>Being provided with one of tho&s;e dome&s;tics
who are always in waiting to offer their &s;ervices
to &s;trangers on their fir&s;t arrival, they were con|ducted
to the hou&s;e of a gentleman who had an
excellent collection of pictures; and though the
greate&s;t part of them were painted by his fa|vourite
arti&s;t, Pallet condemned them all by the
lump, becau&s;e Pickle had told him beforehand,
that there was not one performance of Rubens
among the number.</P>
<P>The next place they vi&s;ited, was what is
called the academy of painting, furni&s;hed with a
number of paultry pieces, in which our painter
recognized the &s;tile of Peter Paul, with many
expre&s;&s;ions of admiration, on the &s;ame &s;ort of
previous intelligence.</P>
<P>From this repo&s;itory they went to the great
church, and being led to the tomb of Rubens,
the whim&s;ical painter fell upon his knees, and
wor&s;hipped, with &s;uch appearance of devotion,
that the attendant, &s;candalized at his &s;uper&s;tition,
pulled him up, ob&s;erving with great warmth,
that the per&s;on buried in that place was no &s;aint,
but as great a &s;inner as him&s;elf; and that if he
was &s;piritually di&s;po&s;ed, there was a chapel of the
Ble&s;&s;ed Virgin, at the di&s;tance of three yards on
the right hand, to which he might retire. He
thought it was incumbent upon him to manife&s;t
&s;ome extraordinary in&s;piration, while he re&s;ided
<PB N="233" REF="242">
on the &s;pot where Rubens was born; and there|fore,
his whole behaviour was an affectation of
rapture, expre&s;&s;ed in di&s;tracted exclamations, con|vul&s;ive
&s;tarts, and uncouth ge&s;ticulations. In the
mid&s;t of this frantic behaviour, he &s;aw an old
Capuchin, with a white beard, mount the pul|pit,
and hold forth to the congregation with &s;uch
violence of empha&s;is and ge&s;ture, as captivated his
fancy; and bawling aloud, &startq;Zounds! what an
excellent Paul preaching at Athens!&endq; he pulled
a pencil and &s;mall memorandum-book from his
pocket, and began to take a &s;ketch of the orator,
with great eagerne&s;s and agitation, &s;aying, &startq;Egad!
friend Raphael, we &s;hall &s;ee whether you or I
have got the be&s;t knack at trumping up an Apo|&s;tle.&endq;
This appearance of di&s;re&s;pect gave offence
to the audience, which began to murmur again&s;t
this heretic libertine; when one of the prie&s;ts
belonging to the choir, in order to prevent any
ill con&s;equence from their di&s;plea&s;ure, came and
told him in the French language, that &s;uch liber|ties
were not permitted in their religion, and ad|vi&s;ed
him to lay a&s;ide his implements, left the
people &s;hould take umbrage at his de&s;ign, and be
provoked to puni&s;h him as a profane &s;coffer at
their wor&s;hip.</P>
<P>The painter &s;eeing him&s;elf addre&s;&s;ed by a friar,
who, while he &s;poke, bowed with great com|plai&s;ance,
imagined that he was a begging bro|ther
come to &s;upplicate his charity; and his at|tention
being quite ingro&s;&s;ed by the de&s;ign he was
making, he patted the prie&s;t's &s;haven crown with
his hand, &s;aying, <HI>Oter tems, oter tems;</HI> and then
re&s;umed his pencil with great earne&s;tne&s;s. The
eccle&s;ia&s;tic perceiving that the &s;tranger did not
comprehend his meaning, pulled him by the &s;leeve,
<PB N="234" REF="243">
and explained him&s;elf in the Latin tongue: upon
which, Pallet, provoked at his intru&s;ion, cur&s;ed
him aloud for an impudent beggarly &s;on of a
whore; and taking out a &s;chelling, flung it upon
the pavement, with manife&s;t &s;igns of indigna|tion.</P>
<P>Some of the common people, enraged to &s;ee
their religion contemned, and their prie&s;ts in|&s;ulted
at the very altar, ro&s;e from their &s;eats, and
&s;urrounding the a&s;toni&s;hed painter, one of the
number &s;natched his book from his hand, and
tore it into a thou&s;and pieces. Frightened as he
was, he could not help crying, &startq;Fire and fag|gots!
all my favourite ideas are gone to wreck!&endq;
and was in danger of being very roughly handled
by the croud, had not Peregrine &s;tepped in, and
a&s;&s;ured them, that he was a poor unhappy gen|tleman,
who laboured under a tran&s;port of the
brain. Tho&s;e who under&s;tood the French lan|guage
communicated this information to the re&s;t;
&s;o that he e&s;caped without any other cha&s;ti&s;e|ment,
than that of being obliged to retire. And
as they could not &s;ee the famous de&s;cent from the
cro&s;s till after the &s;ervice was fini&s;hed, they were
conducted by their dome&s;tique to the hou&s;e of a
painter, where they found a beggar &s;tanding for
his picture, and the arti&s;t actually employed in
repre&s;enting a huge lou&s;e that crawled upon his
&s;houlder. Pallet was wonderfully plea&s;ed with
this circum&s;tance, which he &s;aid was altogether
a new thought, and an excellent hint, of which
he would make his advantage: and in the cour&s;e
of his &s;urvey of this Fleming's performances,
perceiving a piece in which two flies were en|gaged
upon the carca&s;e of a dog half devoured,
he ran to his brother bru&s;h, and &s;wore he was
<PB N="235" REF="244">
worthy of being a fellow-citizen of the immortal
Rubens. He then lamented, with many expre&s;|&s;ions
of grief and re&s;entment, that he had lo&s;t
his common place-book, in which he had pre|&s;erved
a thou&s;and conceptions of the &s;ame &s;ort,
formed by the accidental objects of his &s;en&s;es and
imagination; and took an opportunity of telling
his fellow-travellers, that in execution he had
equalled, if not excelled, the two ancient painters
who vied with each other in the repre&s;entation of
a curtain and a bunch of grapes; for he had ex|hibited
the image of a certain object &s;o like to na|ture,
that the bare &s;ight of it &s;et a whole hog-&s;ty
in an upr$ar.</P>
<P>When he had examined and applauded all the
productions of this minute arti&s;t, they returned
to the great church, and were entertained with
the view of that celebrated ma&s;ter-piece of Ru|bens,
in which he has introduced the portraits of
him&s;elf and his whole family. The doors that
conceal this capital performance were no &s;ooner
unfolded, than our enthu&s;ia&s;t, debarred the u&s;e
of &s;peech, by a previous covenant with his friend
Pickle, lifted up his hands and eyes, and putting
him&s;elf in the attitude of Hamlet, when his fa|ther's
gho&s;t appears, adored in &s;ilent exta&s;y and
awe. He even made a merit of nece&s;&s;ity; and
when they had withdrawn from the place, pro|te&s;ted
that his whole faculties were &s;wallowed up
in love and admiration. He now profe&s;&s;ed him|&s;elf
more than ever enamoured of the Flemi&s;h
&s;chool, raved in extravagant encomiums, and
propo&s;ed, that the whole company &s;hould pay
homage to the memory of the divine Rubens, by
$epairing forthwith to the hou&s;e in which he
<PB N="236" REF="245">
lived, and pro&s;trating them&s;elves on the floor of
his painting room.</P>
<P>As there was nothing remarkable in the tene|ment,
which had been rebuilt more than once
&s;ince the death of that great man, Peregrine ex|cu&s;ed
him&s;elf from complying with the propo&s;al,
on pretence of being fatigued with the circuit
they had already performed. Jolter declined it
for the &s;ame rea&s;on; and the que&s;tion being put
to the doctor, he refu&s;ed his company with an air
of di&s;dain. Pallet, piqued at his contemptuous
manner, a&s;ked if he would not go and &s;ee the
habitation of Pindoor, provided he was in the city
where that poet lived? And when the phy&s;ician
ob&s;erved, that there was an infinite difference be|tween
the man; &startq;That I'll allow, (replied the
painter) for the devil a poet ever lived in Greece
or Troy, that was worthy to clean the pencils of
our beloved Rubens.&endq; The phy&s;ician could not
with any degree of temper and forbearance hear
this outrageous bla&s;phemy, for which, he &s;aid,
Pallet's eyes ought to be picked out by owls:
and the di&s;pute ro&s;e, as u&s;ual, to &s;uch &s;currilities
of language and indecency of behaviour, that
pa&s;&s;engers began to take notice of their animo|&s;ity;
and Peregrine was obliged to interpo&s;e, for
his own credit.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. LXVIII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Peregrine artfully foments a quarrel between Pallet
and the phy&s;ician, who fight a duel on the
ramparts.</HEAD>
<P>THE painter betook him&s;elf to the hou&s;e of
the Flemi&s;h Raphael, and the re&s;t of the
company went back to their lodgings; where the
young gentleman, taking the advantage of being
alone with the phy&s;ician, recapitulated all the af|fronts
he had &s;u&s;tained from the painter's petu|lance,
aggravating every circum&s;tance of the di&s;|grace,
and advi&s;ing him, in the capacity of a
friend, to take care of his honour, which could
not fail to &s;uffer in the opinion of the world, if
he allowed him&s;elf to be in&s;ulted with impunity,
by one &s;o much his inferior in every degree of
con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>The phy&s;ician a&s;&s;ured him, that Pallet had hi|therto
e&s;caped cha&s;ti&s;ement, by being deemed an
object unworthy his re&s;entment, and in con&s;ide|ration
of the wretch's family, for which his com|pa&s;&s;ion
was intere&s;ted; but, that repeated inju|ries
would inflame the mo&s;t benevolent di&s;po|&s;ition:
and although he could find no precedent
of duelling among the Greeks and Romans, whom
he con&s;idered as the patterns of demeanour, Pallet
&s;hould no longer avail him&s;elf of his veneration
for the ancients, but be puni&s;hed for the very
next offence he &s;hould commit.</P>
<P>Having thus &s;pirited up the doctor to a re&s;olu|tion
from which he could not decently &s;werve, our
adventurer acted the incendiary with the other party
al&s;o; giving him to under&s;tand, that the phy|&s;ician
<PB N="238" REF="247">
treated his character with &s;uch contempt,
and behaved to him with &s;uch in&s;olence, as no
gentleman ought to bear: that for his own part,
he was every day put out of countenance by their
mutual animo&s;ity, which appeared in nothing but
vulgar expre&s;&s;ions, more becoming &s;hoe-boys and
oy&s;ter-women than men of honour and educa|tion;
and therefore he &s;hould be obliged, con|trary
to his inclination, to break off all corre|&s;pondence
with them both, if they would not fall
upon &s;ome method to retrieve the dignity of their
characters.</P>
<P>The&s;e repre&s;entations would have had little effect
upon the timidity of the painter, who was like|wi&s;e
too much of a Grecian to approve of &s;ingle
combat, in any other way than that of boxing,
an exerci&s;e in which he was well &s;kill'd, had not
they been accompanied with an in&s;inuation, that
his antagoni&s;t was no Hector, and that he might
humble him into any conce&s;&s;ion, without running
the lea&s;t per&s;onal ri&s;k. Animated by this a&s;&s;urance,
our &s;econd Rubens &s;et the trumpet of defiance to
his mouth, &s;wore that he valued not his life a
ru&s;h, when his honour was concerned, and in|treated
Mr. Pickle to be the bearer of a chal|lenge,
which he would in&s;tantly commit to
writing.</P>
<P>The mi&s;chievous fomentor highly applauded
this mani&s;e&s;tation of courage, by which he was
at liberty to cultivate his friend&s;hip and &s;ociety;
but declined the office of carrying the billet, that
his tenderne&s;, of Pallet's reputation might not be
mi&s;interpreted into an officious de&s;ire of pro|moting
quarrels. At the &s;ametime he recommended
Tom Pipes, not only as a very proper me&s;&s;enger
on this occa&s;ion, but al&s;o as a tru&s;ty &s;econd in
the field. The magnanimous painter took his
<PB N="239" REF="248">

challenge in the&s;e terms.</P>

</LETTER>
<P>This re&s;olute defiance, after having been &s;ub|mitted
to the peru&s;al, and honoured with the ap|probation
of our youth, was committed to the
charge of Pipes, who, according to his orders,
delivered it in the afternoon; and brought for
an&s;wer, that the phy&s;ician would attend him at
the appointed time and place. The challenger was
evidently di&s;compo&s;ed at the unexpected news of
this acceptance, and ran about the hou&s;e in great
di&s;order, in que&s;t of Peregrine, to beg his further
advice and a&s;&s;i&s;tance; but, under&s;tanding that the
youth was engaged in private with his adver&s;ary,
he began to &s;u&s;pect &s;ome collu&s;ion, and cur&s;ed
him&s;elf for his folly and precipitation. He even
entertained &s;ome thoughts of retracting his invi|tation,
and &s;ubmitting to the triumph of his an|tagoni&s;t:
<PB N="240" REF="249">
but, before he would &s;toop to this op|probrious
conde&s;cen&s;ion, he re&s;olved to try an|other
expedient, which might be the means of
&s;aving both his character and per&s;on. In this
hope he vi&s;ited Mr. Jolter, and very gravely de|&s;ired
he would be &s;o good as to undertake the of|fice
of his &s;econd, in a duel which he was to
fight that evening with the phy&s;ician.</P>
<P>The governor, in&s;tead of an&s;wering his ex|pectation,
in expre&s;&s;ing fear and concern, and
breaking forth into exclamations of, &startq;Good
God! gentlemen, what d'ye mean? You &s;hall
not murther one another, while it is in my power
to prevent your purpo&s;e. I will go directly to
the governor of the place, who &s;hall interpo&s;e his
authority.&endq; I &s;ay, in&s;tead of the&s;e and other
friendly menaces of prevention, Jolter heard the
propo&s;al with the mo&s;t phlegmatic tranquillity,
and excu&s;ed him&s;elf from accepting the honour
he intended for him, on account of his character
and &s;ituation, which would not permit him to be
concerned in any &s;uch rencounters. Indeed this
mortifying reception was owing to a previous hint
from Peregrine, who dreading &s;ome &s;ort of in|terruption
from his governor, had made him ac|quainted
with his de&s;ign, and a&s;&s;ured him, that
the affair &s;hould not be brought to any dangerous
i&s;&s;ue.</P>
<P>Thus di&s;appointed, the dejected challenger was
overwhelmed with perplexity and di&s;may; and in
the terrors of death or mutilitation, re&s;olved to
deprecate the wrath of his enemy, and conform
to any &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion he &s;hould propo&s;e; when he was
accidentally encountered by our adventurer, who
with demon&s;trations of infinite &s;atisfaction, told
him in confidence, that his billet had thrown the
<PB N="241" REF="250">
doctor into an agony of con&s;ternation; and that
his acceptance of his challenge was a meer effort
of de&s;pair, calculated to confound the ferocity
of the &s;ender, and di&s;po&s;e him to li&s;ten to terms
of accommodation: that he had imparted the
letter to him with fear and trembling, on pre|tence
of engaging him as a &s;econd, but in reality,
with a view of obtaining his good offices in pro|moting
a reconciliation; &startq;but, perceiving the
&s;ituation of his mind, (added our hero) I thought
it would be more for your honour to baffle his
expectation; and therefore I readily undertook
the ta&s;k of attending him to the field, in full a&s;|&s;urance,
that he will there humble him&s;elf before
you, even to pro&s;tration. In this &s;ecurity, you
may go and prepare your arms, and be&s;peak the
a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Pipes, who will &s;quire you in the
field, while I keep my&s;elf up, that our corre|&s;pondence
may not be &s;u&s;pected by the phy&s;ician.&endq;
Pallet's &s;pirits, that were &s;unk to dejection, ro&s;e
at this encouragement to all the in&s;olence of tri|umph;
he again declared his contempt of danger,
and his pi&s;tols being loaded and accommodated
with new flints, by his tru&s;ty armour-bearer, he
waited, without flinching, for the hour of battle.</P>
<P>On the fir&s;t approach of twilight, &s;omebody
knocked at his door, and Pipes having opened it
at his de&s;ire, he heard the voice of his antagoni&s;t
pronounce, &startq;Tell Mr. Pallet, that I am going
to the place of appointment.&endq; The painter was
not a little &s;urprized at this anticipation, which
&s;o ill agreed with the information he had received
from Pickle; and his concern beginning to re|cur,
he fortified him&s;elf with a large bumper of
brandy, which, however, did not overcome the
anxiety of his thoughts. Neverthele&s;s, he &s;et
<PB N="242" REF="251">
out on the expedition with his &s;econd, betwixt
whom and him&s;elf the following dialogue pa&s;&s;ed,
in their way to the ramparts. &startq;Mr. Pipes, (&s;aid
the painter, with di&s;ordered accent) methinks the
doctor was in a pe&s;tilent hurry with that me&s;&s;age
of his.&endq; &startq;Ey, ey, (an&s;wered Tom) I do &s;up|po&s;e
he longs to be foul of you.&endq; &startq;What!
(replied the other) d'ye think he thir&s;ts after my
blood?&endq; &startq;To be &s;ure a does,&endq; (&s;aid Pipes,
thru&s;ting a large quid of tobacco in his cheek,
with great deliberation.) &startq;If that be the ca&s;e,
(cried Pallet, beginning to &s;hake) he is no better
than a Cannibal, and no Chri&s;tian ought to fight
him on equal footing.&endq; Tom ob&s;erving his
emotion, eyed him with a frown of indignation,
&s;aying, &startq;You an't afraid, are you?&endq; &startq;God
forbid! (replied the challenger, &s;tammering with
fear.) What &s;hould I be afraid of? The wor&s;t
he can do, is to take my life, and then he'll be
an&s;werable both to God and man for the murder:
Don't you think he will?&endq; &startq;I think no &s;uch
matter, (an&s;wered the &s;econd) if &s;o be as how he
puts a brace of bullets through your bows, and kills
you fairly, it is no more murder than if I was to
bring down a noddy from the main-top-&s;ail-yard.&endq;
By this time, Pallet's teeth chattered with &s;uch
violence, that he could &s;carce pronounce this
reply, &startq;Mr. Thomas, you &s;eem to make very
light of a man's life; but I tru&s;t in the Almighty,
I &s;hall not be &s;o ea&s;ily brought down. Sure many
a man has fought a duel, without lo&s;ing his life.
Do you imagine that I run &s;uch a hazard of fall|ing
by the hand of my adver&s;ary?&endq; You may,
or you may not, (&s;aid the unconcerned Pipes) ju&s;t
as it happens. What then? Death is a debt that
every man owes, according to the &s;ong; and if
<PB N="243" REF="252">
you &s;et foot to foot, I think one of you mu&s;t go
to pot.&endq; &startq;Foot to foot! (exclaimed the terri|fied
painter) that's downright butchery; and I'll
be damn'd before I &s;ight any man on earth in
&s;uch a barbarous way. What! d'ye take me to
be a &s;avage bea&s;t?&endq; This declaration he made
while they a&s;cended the ramparts; and his atten|dant
perceiving the phy&s;ician and his &s;econd at the
di&s;tance of an hundred paces before them, gave
him notice of their appearance, and advi&s;ed him
to make ready, and behave like a man. Pallet
in vain endeavoured to conceal his pannic, which
di&s;covered it&s;elf in an univer&s;al trepidation of bo|dy,
and the lamentable tone in which he an|&s;wered
this exhortation of Pipes; &s;aying, &startq;I do
behave like a man; but you would have me act
the part of a brute. Are they coming this way?&endq;
When Tom told him that they had faced about,
and admoni&s;hed him to advance, the nerves of
his arm refu&s;ed their office, he could not hold out
his pi&s;tol, and in&s;tead of going forward, retreated
with an in&s;en&s;ibility of motion; till Pipes, placing
him&s;elf in the rear, &s;et his own back to that of
his principal, and &s;wore he &s;hould not budge an
inch farther in that direction.</P>
<P>While the valet thus tutored the painter, his
ma&s;ter enjoyed the terrors of the phy&s;ician, which
were more ridiculous than tho&s;e of Pallet, be|cau&s;e
he was more intent upon di&s;gui&s;ing them.
His declaration to Pickle in the morning, would
not &s;uffer him to &s;tart any objections when he re|ceived
the challenge; and finding that the young
gentleman made no offer of mediating the affair,
but rather congratulated him on the occa&s;ion,
when he communicated the painter's billet, all
$word$ efforts con&s;i&s;ted in oblique hints, and general
<PB N="244" REF="253">
reflections upon the ab&s;urdity of duelling, which
was fir&s;t introduced among civilized nations, by
the barbarous Huns and Longobards. He like|wi&s;e
pretended to ridicule the u&s;e of fire-arms,
which confounded all the di&s;tinctions of &s;kill and
addre&s;s, and deprived a combatant of the oppor|tunity
of &s;ignalizing his per&s;onal prowe&s;s.</P>
<P>Pickle a&s;&s;ented to the ju&s;tne&s;s of his ob&s;erva|tions;
but at the &s;ame time repre&s;ented the ne|ce&s;&s;ity
of complying with the cu&s;toms of the
world, (ridiculous as they were) on which a
man's honour and reputation depend. So that,
&s;eeing no hopes of profiting by that artifice, the
republican's agitation became more and more re|markable;
and he propo&s;ed in plain terms, that
they &s;hould contend in armour, like the com|batants
of ancient days; for it was but rea&s;onable,
that they &s;hould practi&s;e the manner of fighting,
&s;ince they adopted the di&s;po&s;ition of tho&s;e iron
times.</P>
<P>Nothing could have afforded more diver&s;ion to
our hero, than the &s;ight of two &s;uch duelli&s;ts
ca&s;ed in iron; and he wi&s;hed that he had pro|moted
the quarrel in Bru&s;&s;els, where he could
have hired the armour of Charles the fifth, and
the valiant duke of Parma, for their accommo|dation:
but, as there was no po&s;&s;ibility of fur|ni&s;hing
them cap-a-pee at Antwerp, he per&s;uaded
him to conform to the modern u&s;e of the &s;word,
and meet the painter on his own terms; and &s;u&s;|pecting
that his fear would &s;upply him with other
excu&s;es for declining the combat, he comforted
him with &s;ome di&s;tant in&s;inuations to the preju|dice
of his adver&s;ary's courage, which would in
all probability, evaporate, before any mi&s;chief could
happen.</P>
<P><PB N="245" REF="254">
Notwith&s;tanding this encouragement, he could
not &s;uppre&s;s the reluctance with which he went
to the field, and ca&s;t many a wi&s;hful look over
his left &s;houlder, to &s;ee whether or not his ad|ver&s;ary
was at his heels; and when, by the ad|vice
of his &s;econd, he took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the
ground, and turned about with his face to the
enemy, it was not &s;o dark, but that Peregrine
could perceive the unu&s;ual palene&s;s of his coun|tenance,
and the &s;weat &s;tanding in large drops
upon his forehead; nay, there was a manife&s;t
di&s;order in his &s;peech, when he regretted his want
of the Pila and Parma, with which he would have
made a rattling noi&s;e, to a&s;toni&s;h his foe, in
&s;pringing forward, and &s;inging the hymn to bat|tle,
in the manner of the ancients.</P>
<P>In the mean time, ob&s;erving the he&s;itation of
his antagoni&s;t, who, far from advancing, &s;eemed
to recoil, and even &s;truggle with his &s;econd, he
gue&s;ied the &s;ituation of the painter's thoughts;
and collecting all the manhood that he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed,
&s;eized the opportunity of profiting by his enemy's
con&s;ternation; and &s;triking his &s;word and pi&s;tol
together, advanced in a &s;ort of trot, rai&s;ing a
loud howl, in which he repeated, in lieu of the
Spartan &s;ong, part of a &s;trophe from one of Pin|dar's
Pythia, beginning with <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">,
&amp;c. This imitation of the
Greeks had all the de&s;ired effect upon the painter,
who &s;eeing the phy&s;ician running towards him,
like a fury, with a pi&s;tol in his right hand, which
was extended, and hearing the dreadful yell he
uttered, and the outlandi&s;h words he pronounced,
was &s;eized with an univer&s;al pal&s;y of his limbs,
and would have dropp'd down upon the ground,
had not Pipes &s;upported and encouraged him to
<PB N="246" REF="255">
&s;tand upon his defence. The doctor, contrary
to his expectation, finding that he had not flinched
from the &s;pot, though he had now performed
one half of his career, put in practice his la&s;t
effort, by firing his pi&s;tol, the noi&s;e of which
no &s;ooner reached the ears of the affrighted painter,
than he recommended his &s;oul to God, and roared
for mercy with great vociferation.</P>
<P>The republican, overjoyed at this exclama|tion,
commanded him to yield, and &s;urrender
his arms, on pain of immediate death; upon
which he threw away his pi&s;tols and &s;word, in
&s;pite of all the admonitions and even threats of his
&s;econd, who left him to his fate, and went up to
his ma&s;ter, &s;topping his no&s;e with &s;igns of loath|ing
and abhorrence.</P>
<P>$word$ victor having won the Spolia Opima,
granted him his life, on condition, that he would
on his knees &s;upplicate his pardon, acknowledge
him&s;elf inferior to his conqueror in every virtue
and qualification, and promi&s;e for the future to
merit his favour by &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion and re&s;pect. The&s;e
in&s;olent terms were readily embraced by the un|fortunate
challenger, who fairly owned, that he
was not at all calculated for the purpo&s;es of war,
and that henceforth he would contend with no
weapon but his pencil. He begg'd with great
humility, that Mr. Pickle would not think the
wor&s;e of his morals for this defect of courage,
which was a natural infirmity inherited from his
father, and &s;u&s;pend his opinion of his talents,
until he &s;hould have an opportunity of contem|plating
the charms of his Cleopatra, which would
be fini&s;hed in le&s;s than three months.</P>
<P>Our hero ob&s;erved with an affected air of di&s;|plea&s;ure,
that no man could be ju&s;tly condemned
<PB N="247" REF="256">
for being &s;ubject to the impre&s;&s;ions of fear; and
therefore his cowardice might ea&s;ily be forgiven;
but, there was &s;omething &s;o pre&s;umptuous, di&s;|hone&s;t
and di&s;ingenuous, in arrogating a quality
to which he knew he had not the &s;malle&s;t pre|ten&s;ion,
that he could not forget his mi&s;behaviour
all at once, though he would conde&s;cend to com|municate
with him as formerly, in hopes of &s;ee|ing
a reformation in his conduct. Pallet pro|te&s;ted,
that there was no di&s;&s;imulation in the
ca&s;e; for he was ignorant of his own weakne&s;s,
until his re&s;olution was put to the trial: he faith|fully
promi&s;ed to demean him&s;elf, during the re|maining
part of the tour, with that con&s;cious
mode&s;ty and penitence which became a per&s;on in
his condition; and, for the pre&s;ent, implored the
a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Mr. Pipes, in di&s;embara&s;&s;ing him
from the di&s;agreeable con&s;equence of his fear.</P>

<DIV2 N="69" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. LXIX.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">The doctor exults in his victory. They &s;et out for
Rotterdam, where they are entertained by two
Dutch gentlemen in a yacht, which is overturned
in the Maes, to the manife&s;t hazard of the
painter's life. They &s;pend the evening with their
entertainers, and next day vi&s;it a cabinet of cu|rio&s;ities.</HEAD>
<P>TOM was accordingly ordered to mini&s;ter
to his occa&s;ions; and the conqueror, elated
with his &s;ucce&s;s, which he in a great mea&s;ure at|tributed
to his manner of attack, and the hymn
which he howled, told Peregrine, that he was
now convinced of the truth of what Pindar &s;ung
in the&s;e words, <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">
<PB N="248" REF="257">
<GAP DESC="FOREIGN">; for he had no &s;ooner begun to
repeat the mellifluent &s;trains of that divine poet,
than the wretch his antagoni&s;t was confounded,
and his nerves un&s;trung.</P>
<P>On their return to the inn, he expatiated on
the prudence and tranquillity of his own beha|viour,
and a&s;cribed the con&s;ternation of Pallet to
the remembrance of &s;ome crime that lay heavy
upon his con&s;cience: for, in his opinion, a man
of virtue and common &s;en&s;e could not po&s;&s;ibly be
afraid of death, which is not only the peaceful
harbour that receives him &s;hattered on the tem|pe&s;tuous
&s;ea of life, but al&s;o the eternal &s;eal of
his fame and glory, which it is no longer in his
power to forfeit and forego. He lamented his
fate, in being doomed to live in &s;uch degenerate
days, when war is become a mercenary trade;
and ardently wi&s;hed, that the day would come,
when he &s;hould have &s;uch an opportunity of &s;ig|nalizing
his courage in the cau&s;e of liberty, as
that of Marathon, where an handful of Athe|nians,
fighting for their freedom, defeated the
whole &s;trength of the Per&s;ian empire. &startq;Would
to heaven! (&s;aid he) my mu&s;e were ble&s;&s;ed with
an occa&s;ion to emulate that glorious te&s;timony
on the trophy in Cyprus, erected by Cimon, for
two great victories gained on the &s;ame day over
the Per&s;ians by &s;ea and land; in which it is very
remarkable, that the greatne&s;s of the occa&s;ion
has rai&s;ed the manner of expre&s;&s;ion above the
u&s;ual &s;implicity and mode&s;ty of all other ancient
in&s;criptions.&endq; He then repeated it with all the
pomp of declamation, and &s;ignified his hope, that
the French would one day invade us with &s;uch an
army as that which Xerxes led into Greece, that
<PB N="249" REF="258">
it might be in his power to devote him&s;elf, like
Leo$das, to the freedom of his country.</P>
<P>This memorable combat being thus deter|mined,
and every thing that was remarkable in
Antwerp &s;urveyed, they &s;ent their baggage down
the Scheld to Rotterdam, and &s;et out for the
&s;ame place in a po&s;t-waggon, which that &s;ame
evening brought them in &s;afety to the banks of
the Maeze. They put up at an Engli&s;h hou&s;e
of entertainment, remarkable for the mode&s;ty
and moderation of the landlord; and next morn|ing
the doctor went in per&s;on, to deliver letters
of recommendation to two Dutch gentlemen,
from one of his acquaintance at Paris. Neither
of them happened to be at home when he called;
&s;o that he left a me&s;&s;age at their lodgings, with
his addre&s;s; and in the afternoon they waited up|on
the company, and after many ho&s;pitable pro|fe&s;&s;ions,
one of the two invited them to &s;pend
the evening at his hou&s;e.</P>
<P>Mean while, they had provided a plea&s;ure-yacht,
in which they propo&s;ed to treat them with
an excur&s;ion upon the Maeze. This being al|mo&s;t
the only diver&s;ion that place affords, our
young gentleman reli&s;hed the propo&s;al; and not|with&s;tanding
the remon&s;trances of Mr. Jolter,
who declined the voyage on account of the rough|ne&s;s
of the weather, they went on board with|out
he&s;itation, and found a collation prepared in
the cabin. While they tacked to and fro in
the river, under the impul&s;e of a mackerel breeze,
the phy&s;ician expre&s;&s;ed his &s;atisfaction, and Pallet
was ravi&s;hed with the entertainment. But the
wind increa&s;ing, to the un&s;peakable joy of the
Dutchmen, who had now an opportunity of
&s;hewing their dexterity in the management of the
<PB N="250" REF="259">
ve&s;&s;el, the gue&s;ts found it inconvenient to &s;tand
upon deck, and impo&s;&s;ible to &s;it below, on ac|count
of the clouds of tobacco-&s;moke which
rolled from the pipes of their entertainers, in &s;uch
volumes as annoyed them even to the hazard of
&s;uffocation. This fumigation, together with the
extraordinary motion of the &s;hip, began to affect
the head and &s;tomach of the painter, who begg'd
earne&s;tly to be &s;et on &s;hore: but the Dutch gen|tlemen,
who had no idea of his &s;ufferings, to
which they had always been utter &s;trangers, in|&s;i&s;ted,
with &s;urpri&s;ing ob&s;tinacy of regard, upon
his &s;taying until he &s;hould &s;ee an in&s;tance of the
&s;kill of their mariners; and bringing him on deck,
commanded the men to carry the ve&s;&s;el's lee|gunwale
under water. This nicety of navigation
they in&s;tantly performed, to the admiration of
Pickle, the di&s;compo&s;ure of the doctor, and terror
of Pallet, who ble&s;&s;ed him&s;elf from the courte&s;y
of a Dutchman, and prayed to heaven for his
deliverance.</P>
<P>While the Hollanders enjoyed the reputation
of this feat, and the di&s;tre&s;s of the painter at the
&s;ame time, the yacht was overtaken by a &s;udden
&s;quall, that over&s;et her in a moment, and flung
every man overboard into the Maeze, before
they could have the lea&s;t warning of their fate,
much le&s;s, time to provide again&s;t the accident.
Peregrine, who was an expert &s;wimmer, reached
the &s;hore in &s;afety; the phy&s;ician, in the agonies
of de&s;pair, laid fa&s;t hold on the trunk-breeches
of one of the men, who dragged him to the
other &s;ide; the entertainers landed at the bomb-keys,
&s;moking their pipes all the way with great
deliberation; and the poor painter mu&s;t have
gone to the bottom, had not he been encoun|tered
<PB N="251" REF="260">
by the cable of a &s;hip, that lay at anchor
near the &s;cene of their di&s;a&s;ter. Though his
&s;en&s;es had for&s;aken him, his hands fa&s;tened by
in&s;tinct on this providential occurrence, which
he held with &s;uch a convul&s;ive gra&s;p, that when
a boat was &s;ent out to bring him on &s;hore, it was
with the utmo&s;t difficulty that his fingers were
di&s;engaged. He was carried into a hou&s;e, de|prived
of the u&s;e of &s;peech, and bereft of all
&s;en&s;ation; and being &s;u&s;pended by the heels, a
va&s;t quantity of water ran out of his mouth.
This evacuation being made, he began to utter
dreadful groans, which gradually increa&s;ed to a
continued roar; and after he had regained the u&s;e
of his &s;en&s;es, underwent a delirium that la&s;ted
&s;everal hours. As for the treaters, they never
dreamed of expre&s;&s;ing the lea&s;t concern to Pickle
or the phy&s;ician for what had happened, becau&s;e
it was an accident &s;o common, as to pa&s;s with|out
notice; but they were very much &s;urprized
to find, upon inquiry, that Pallet could not
&s;wim, it being as natural for a Dutchman, as a
$eal-board, to float upon the &s;urface.</P>
<P>Leaving the care of the ve&s;&s;el to the &s;eamen,
the company retired to their re&s;pective lodgings,
in order to &s;hift their cloaths; and in the evening
our travellers were conducted to the hou&s;e of
their new friend, who, with a view of making
his invitation the more agreeable, had a&s;&s;embled
to the number of twenty or thirty Engli&s;hmen,
of all ranks and degrees, from the merchant to
the periwig$ maker's prentice.</P>
<P>In the mid&s;t of this congregation &s;tood a
chafing-di&s;h with l$ve-c$als, for the convenience
of lighting their pipes, and every individual was
accommodated with a &s;pitting-box. There was
<PB N="252" REF="261">
not a mouth in the apartment unfurni&s;hed with
a tube, &s;o that they re&s;embled a convocation of
Ch$meras breathing fire and &s;moke; and our
gentlemen were fain to imitate their example in
their own defence. It is not to be &s;uppo&s;ed that
the conver&s;ation was either very &s;prightly or po|lite;
the whole entertainment was of the Dutch
ca&s;t, that is, frowzy and phlegmatic: and our
adventurer, as he returned to his lodging, tor|tured
with the head-ach, and di&s;gu&s;ted with
every circum&s;tance of his treatment, cur&s;ed the
hour in which the doctor had &s;addled them with
&s;uch trouble&s;ome companions.</P>
<P>Next morning, by eight o'clock, the&s;e polite
Hollanders returned the vi&s;it, and after breakfa&s;t,
attended their Engli&s;h friends to the hou&s;e of a
per&s;on that po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a very curious cabinet of
curio&s;ities, to which they had &s;ecured our com|pany's
admi&s;&s;ion. The owner of this collection
was a chee&s;emonger, who received them in a
woollen night-cap, with &s;traps buttoned under
his chin. As he under&s;tood no language but his
own, he told them, by the canal of one of their
conductors, that he did not make a practice of
&s;hewing his curio&s;ities; but under&s;tanding that
they were Engli&s;hmen, and recommended to his
friends, he was content to &s;ubmit them to their
peru&s;al. So &s;aying, he led them up a dark &s;tair,
into a &s;mall room, decorated with a few paltry
figures in plai&s;ter of Paris, two or three mi&s;e|rable
land&s;chapes, the &s;kins of an otter, &s;eal, and
&s;ome fi&s;hes &s;tuffed; and in one corner &s;tood a
gla&s;s-ca&s;e, furni&s;hed with newts, frogs, lizzards
and &s;erpents, pre&s;erved in &s;pirits; a human foetus,
a calf with two heads, and about two dozen of
butterflies pinned upon paper.</P>
<P><PB N="253" REF="262">
The virtuo&s;o having exhibited the&s;e particulars,
eyed the &s;trangers with a look &s;olliciting admira|tion
and applau&s;e; and as he could not perceive
any &s;ymptom of either in their ge&s;tures or coun|tenances,
withdrew a curtain, and di&s;played a
wain&s;cot che&s;t of drawers, in which, he gave
them to under&s;tand, was &s;omething that would
agreeably amu&s;e the imagination. Our travel|lers,
regaled with this notice, imagined that they
would be entertained with the &s;ight of &s;ome cu|rious
medals, or other productions of antiquity;
but how were they di&s;appointed, when they &s;aw
nothing but a variety of &s;hells, di&s;po&s;ed in whim|&s;ical
figures, in each drawer! After he had de|tained
them full two hours with a tedious com|mentary
upon the &s;hape, &s;ize and colour of each
department, he, with a &s;upercilious &s;imper, de|&s;ired
that the Engli&s;h gentlemen would frankly
and candidly declare, whether his cabinet, or
that of mynheer Sloane, at London, was the mo&s;t
valuable. When this reque&s;t was &s;ignified in
Engli&s;h to the company, the painter in&s;tantly ex|claimed,
&startq;By the Lard! they are not to be
named of a day. And as for that matter, I
would not give one corner of Saltero's coffee|hou&s;e,
at Chel&s;ea, for all the tra&s;h he hath
&s;hewn.&endq; Peregrine, unwilling to mortify any
per&s;on who had done his endeavour to plea&s;e
him, ob&s;erved, that what they had &s;een was very
curious and entertaining; but that no private
collection in Europe was equal to that of Sir
Hans Sloane, which, exclu&s;ive of pre&s;ents, had
co&s;t an hundred thou&s;and pounds. The two con|ductors
were confounded at this a&s;&s;everation,
which being communicated to the chee&s;emonger,
he &s;hook his head with a &s;ignificant grin; and
<PB N="254" REF="263">
tho' he did not choo&s;e to expre&s;s his incredulity
in words, gave our hero to under&s;tand, that he
did not much depend upon his veracity.</P>
<P>From the hou&s;e of this Dutch naturali&s;t, they
were dragged all round the city, by the painful
civility of their attendants, who did not quit them
till the evening was well advanced, and then not
till after they had promi&s;ed to be with them be|fore
ten o'clock next day, in order to conduct
them to a country-hou&s;e, &s;ituated in a plea&s;ant
village on the other &s;ide of the river.</P>
<P>Pickle was already &s;o much fatigued with their
ho&s;pitality, that, for the fir&s;t time of his life, he
&s;uffered a dejection of &s;pirits; and re&s;olved, at
any rate, to avoid the threatened per&s;ecution of
to-morrow: with this view, he ordered his &s;er|vants
to pack up &s;ome cloaths and linnen in a
portmanteau; and in the morning embarked,
with his governor, in the Treck&s;kuyt, for the
Hague, whither he pretended to be called by
&s;ome urgent occa&s;ion, leaving his fellow-travel|lers
to make his apology to their friends; and
a&s;&s;uring them, that he would not proceed for
Am&s;terdam, without their &s;ociety. He arrived at
the Hague in the forenoon, and dined at an ordi|nary
frequented by officers and people of fa&s;hion;
where being informed, that the prince&s;s would &s;ee
company in the evening, he dre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf in a
rich &s;uit of the Pari&s;ian cut, and went to court,
without any introduction. A per&s;on of his ap|pearance
could not fail to attract the notice of
&s;uch a &s;mall circle. The prince him&s;elf under|&s;tanding
he was an Engli&s;hman and a &s;tranger,

welcomed him to the place, conver&s;ed with him,
for &s;ome minutes, on the common topics of di&s;|cour&s;e.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">They proceed to the Hague; from whence they de|part
for Am&s;terdam, where they &s;ee a Dutch
tragedy. Vi&s;it a mu&s;ick-hou&s;e, in which Pere|grine
quarrels with the captain of a man of war.
They pa&s;s through Haarlem, in their way to
Leyden. Return to Rotterdam, where the
company &s;eparates, and our hero, with his atten|dants,
arrives in &s;afety at Harwich.</HEAD>
<P>BEing joined by their fellow-travellers, in the
morning, they made a tour to all the re|markable
places in this celebrated village; &s;aw
the Foundery, the Stadthou&s;e, the Spinhuys,
Vauxhall, and Count Bentinck's gardens, and in
the evening went to the French comedy, which
was directed by a noted Harlequin, who had
found means to flatter the Dutch ta&s;te &s;o effec|tually,
that they extolled him as the greate&s;t actor
that ever appeared in the province of Holland.
This famous company did not repre&s;ent regular
theatrical pieces, but only a &s;ort of impromptu's,
in which this noted player always performed the
greate&s;t part of the entertainment. Among other
&s;allies of wit that e&s;caped him, there was one cir|cum&s;tance
&s;o remarkably adapted to the di&s;po&s;ition
and genius of his audience, that it were pity to
pa&s;s it over in &s;ilence: A windmill being exhi|bited
on the &s;cene, Harlequin, after having &s;ur|veyed
it with curio&s;ity and admiration, a&s;ks of
one of the millers, the u&s;e of that machine; and
being told, that it was a windmill, ob&s;erves with
&s;ome concern, that as there was not the lea&s;t
breath of wind, he could not have the plea&s;ure of
<PB N="256" REF="265">
&s;eeing it turn round. Urged by this con&s;idera|tion,
he puts him&s;elf into the attitude of a per|&s;on
wrapt in profound meditation; and having
continued a few &s;econds in this po&s;ture, runs to
the miller with great eagerne&s;s and joy, and tell|ing
him, that he had found an expedient to make
his mill work, very fairly unbuttons his breeches,
and pre&s;enting his po&s;teriors to the &s;ails of the ma|chine,
certain explo&s;ions are immediately heard,
and the arms of the mill begin to turn round, to
the infinite &s;atisfaction of the &s;pectators, who ap|prove
the joke with loud peals of applau&s;e.</P>
<P>Our travellers &s;tayed a few days at the Hague,
during which the young gentleman waited on the
Briti&s;h emba&s;&s;ador, to whom he was recom|mended
by his Excellency at Paris, and lo&s;t about
thirty guineas at billiards to a French adventurer,
who decoyed him into the &s;nare by keeping up
his game; then they departed in a po&s;t-waggon
for Am&s;terdam, being provided with letters of in|troduction
to an Engli&s;h merchant re&s;iding in
that city, under who&s;e au&s;pices they vi&s;ited every
thing worth &s;eeing, and among other excur&s;ions
went to &s;ee a Dutch tragedy acted; an enter|tainment
which, of all others, had the &s;trange&s;t
effect upon the organs of our hero: the dre&s;s of
their chief per&s;onages was &s;o antick, their man|ner
&s;o aukwardly ab&s;urd, and their language &s;o
ridiculou&s;ly unfit for conveying the &s;entiments of
love and honour, that Peregrine's nerves were
diuretically affected with the complicated ab&s;ur|dity,
and he was compelled to withdraw twenty
times before the cata&s;trophe of the piece.</P>
<P>The &s;ubject of this performance was the famous
&s;tory of Scipio's continence and virtue, in re&s;tor|ing
<PB N="257" REF="266">
the fair captive to her lover. The young
Roman hero was repre&s;ented by a broad-fac'd Ba|tavian,
in a burgo-ma&s;ter's gown and a fur-cap,
&s;itting &s;moaking his pipe at a table furni&s;hed with
a can of beer, a drinking-gla&s;s, and a plate of
tobacco: the lady was &s;uch a per&s;on as Scipio
might very well be &s;uppo&s;ed to give away, with|out
any great effort of genero&s;ity; and indeed the
C$ltiberi$n prince &s;eemed to be of that opinion;
for, upon receiving her from the hand of the
victor, he di&s;covered none of tho&s;e tran&s;ports of
gratitude and joy which Livy de&s;cribes, in re|counting
this event. The Dutch Scipio, how|ever,
was complai&s;ant enough in his way; for he
de&s;ired her to &s;it at his right hand, by the appel|lation
of <HI>Ya frow,</HI> and with his own fingers filling
a clean pipe, pre&s;ented it to Mynheer Allucio the
lover. The re&s;t of the oeconomy of the piece
was in the &s;ame ta&s;te; which was &s;o agreeable to
the audience, that they &s;eemed to have &s;haken
off their natural phlegm, in order to applaud the
performance.</P>
<P>From the play our company adjourned to the
hou&s;e of their friend, where they &s;pent the even|ing;
and the conver&s;ation turning upon poetry,
a Dutchman who was pre&s;ent, and under&s;tood
the Engli&s;h language, having li&s;tened very atten|tively
to the di&s;cour&s;e, lifted up with both hands
the greate&s;t part of a Che&s;hire chee&s;e that lay up|on
the table, &s;aying, &startq;I do know vat is boetrie.
Mine brotre be a great boet, and ave vrought a
book as dick as all dat.&endq; Pickle, diverted with
this method of e&s;timating an author according to
the quantity of his works, inquired about the
&s;ubjects of this bard's writings; but of the&s;e his
brother could give no account, or other informa|tion,
<PB N="258" REF="267">
but that there was little market for the
commodity, which hung heavy upon his hands,
and induced him to wi&s;h he had applied him&s;elf
to another trade.</P>
<P>The only remarkable &s;cene in Am&s;terdam,
which our company had not &s;een, was the Spuyl
or mu&s;ick-hou&s;es, which, by the connivance of
the magi&s;trates, are maintained for the recreation
of tho&s;e who might attempt the cha&s;tity of credi|table
women, if they were not provided with
&s;uch conveniences. To one of the&s;e night|hou&s;es
did our travellers repair, under the con|duct
of the Engli&s;h merchant, and were intro|duced
into &s;uch another place as the ever-memo|rable
coffee-hou&s;e of Moll King; with this dif|ference,
that the company here were not &s;o riot|ous
as the Bucks of Covent-Garden, but formed
them&s;elves into a circle, within which &s;ome of
the number danced to the mu&s;ick of a &s;curvy or|gan
and a few other in&s;truments, that uttered
tunes very &s;uitable to the di&s;po&s;ition of the
hearers, while the whole apartment was &s;hrouded
with clouds of &s;moke impervious to the view.
When our gentlemen entered, the floor was oc|cupied
by two females and their gallants, who,
in the performance of their exerci&s;e, li&s;ted their
legs like &s;o many oxen at plough; and the pipe of
one of the&s;e hoppers happening to be exhau&s;ted
in the mid&s;t of his &s;arabrand, he very deliberately
drew forth his tobacco-box, filling, and lighting
it again, without any interruption to the dance.
Peregrine being unchecked by the pre&s;ence of
his governor, who was too tender of his own re|putation
to attend them in this expedition, made
up to a &s;prightly French girl that &s;at in &s;eeming
expectation of a cu&s;tomer, and prevailing upon
<PB N="259" REF="268">
her to be his partner, led her into the circle, and,
in his turn, took the opportunity of dancing a
minuet, to the admiration of all pre&s;ent. He in|tended
to have exhibited another &s;pecimen of his
ability in this art, when a captain of a Dutch man
of war chancing to come in, and &s;ee a &s;tranger
engaged with the lady whom, it &s;eems, he had
$e&s;poke for his bedfellow, he advanced, without
any ceremony, and &s;eizing her by the arm, pull'd
her to the other &s;ide of the room. Our adven|turer,
who was not a man to put up with &s;uch a
brutal affront, followed the ravi&s;her with indig|nation
in his eyes; and pu&s;hing him on one &s;ide,
retook the &s;ubject of their conte&s;t, and led her
back to the place from whence &s;he had been
dragged. The Dutchman, enraged at the
youth's pre&s;umption, obeyed the fir&s;t dictates of
his choler, and lent his rival an hearty box on
the ear; which was immediately repaid with in|tere&s;t,
before our hero could recollect him&s;elf
&s;ufficiently to lay his hand upon his &s;word, and
beckon the aggre&s;&s;or to the door.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the confu&s;ion and di&s;order
which this affair produced in the room, and the
endeavours of Pickle's company, who interpo&s;ed,
in order to prevent blood&s;hed, the antagoni&s;ts
gained the &s;treet; and Peregrine drawing, was
&s;urpri&s;ed to &s;ee the captain advance again&s;t him
with a long knife, which he preferred to the
&s;word that hung by his &s;ide. The youth, con|founded
at this prepo&s;terous behaviour, de&s;ired
him, in the French tongue, to lay a&s;ide that vul|gar
implement, and approach like a gentleman$
but the Hollander, who neithes under&s;tood the
propo&s;al, nor would have complied with his de|mand
had he been made acquainted with his
<PB N="260" REF="269">
meaning, ru&s;hed forward like a de&s;perado, before
his adver&s;ary could put him&s;elf on his guard; and
if the young gentleman had not been endued
with &s;urpri&s;ing agility, his no&s;e would have fallen
a &s;acrifice to the fury of the a&s;&s;ailant. Finding
him&s;elf in &s;uch imminent jeopardy, he jumped to
one &s;ide, and the Dutchman pa&s;&s;ing him, in the
force of his career, he with one nimble kick
made &s;uch application to his enemy's heels, that
he flew like lightening into the canal, where he
had almo&s;t peri&s;hed, by pitching upon one of the
po&s;ts with which it was faced.</P>
<P>Peregrine having performed this exploit, did
not &s;tay for the captain's coming on &s;hore, but
retreated with all di&s;patch, by the advice of his
conductor; and next day embarked, with his
companions, in the Skuyt, for Haarlem, where
they dined, and in the evening arrived at the an|tient
city of Leyden, where they met with &s;ome
Engli&s;h &s;tudents, who treated them with great
ho&s;pitality. Not but that the harmony of the
conver&s;ation was that &s;ame night interrupted by
a di&s;pute that aro&s;e between one of tho&s;e young
gentlemen and the phy&s;ician, about the cold and
hot methods of pre&s;cription in the gout and rheu|mati&s;m;
and proceeded to &s;uch a degree of mu|tual
reviling, that Pickle a&s;hamed and incen&s;ed
at his fellow-traveller's want of urbanity, e&s;|pou&s;ed
the other's cau&s;e, and openly rebuked him
for his unmannerly petulance, which (he &s;aid)
rendered him unfit for the purpo&s;es, and unworthy
of the benefit of, &s;ociety. This unexpected de|claration
overwhelmed the doctor with amaze|ment
and confu&s;ion; he was in&s;tantaneou&s;ly de|prived
of his &s;peech, and during the remaining
part of the partie, &s;at in &s;ilent mortification. In
<PB N="261" REF="270">
all probability he deliberated with him&s;elf, whe|ther
or not he &s;hould expo&s;tulate with the young
gentleman on the freedom he had taken with his
character in a company of &s;trangers; but as he
knew that he had not a Pallet to deal with, he
very prudently &s;uppre&s;&s;ed that &s;ugge&s;tion, and in
&s;ecret chewed the cud of re&s;entment.</P>
<P>After they had vi&s;ited the phy&s;ic garden, the
univer&s;ity, the anatomical hall, and every other
thing that was recommended to their view, they
returned to Rotterdam, and held a con&s;ultation
upon the method of tran&s;porting them&s;elves to
England. The doctor, who&s;e grudge again&s;t Pe|regrine
was rather inflamed than allayed by our
hero's indifference and neglect, had tampered
with the &s;implicity of the painter, who was proud
of his advances towards a perfect reconciliation;
and now took the opportunity of parting with
our adventurer, by declaring that he and his friend
Mr. Pallet were re&s;olved to take their pa&s;&s;age in
a trading &s;loop, after he had heard Peregrine ob|ject
again&s;t that tedious, di&s;agreeable, and uncer|tain
method of conveyance. Pickle immediately
&s;aw his intention; and, without u&s;ing the lea&s;t ar|gument
to di&s;&s;uade them from their de&s;ign, or
expre&s;&s;ing the &s;malle&s;t degree of concern at their
&s;eparation, very coolly wi&s;hed them a pro&s;perous
voyage, and ordered his baggage to be &s;ent to
Helvoet&s;luys, where he him&s;elf, and his retinue,
went on board of the pacquet next day, and, by
the favour of a fair wind, in eighteen hours ar|rived
at Harwich.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Peregrine delivers his letters of recommendation at
London, and returns to the gari&s;on, to the un|&s;peakable
joy of the commodore and his whole
family.</HEAD>
<P>NOW that our hero found him&s;elf on En|gli&s;h
ground, his heart dilated with the
proud recollection of his own improvement &s;ince
he left his native &s;oil; he began to recognize
the intere&s;ting ideas of his tender years; he en|joyed,
by anticipation, the plea&s;ure of &s;eeing
his friends in the gari&s;on, after an ab&s;ence of
eighteen months; and the image of his charming
Emily, which other le&s;s worthy con&s;iderations
had depre&s;&s;ed, re&s;umed the full po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his
brea&s;t. He remembred, with &s;hame, that he
had neglected the corre&s;pondence with her bro|ther,
which he him&s;elf had &s;ollicited, and in con|&s;equence
of which he had received a letter from
that young gentleman while he lived at Paris. In
&s;pite of the&s;e con&s;cientious reflections, he was
too &s;elf-&s;ufficient to think he &s;hould find any dif|ficulty
in obtaining forgivene&s;s for the&s;e &s;ins of
omi&s;&s;ion; and began to imagine, that his pa&s;&s;ion
would be prejudicial to the dignity of his &s;itua|tion,
if it could not be gratified upon terms which
formerly his imagination dur&s;t not conceive.</P>
<P>Sorry am I, that the ta&s;k I have undertaken,
lays me under the nece&s;&s;ity of divulging this de|generacy
in the &s;entiments of our imperious
youth, who was now in the heyday of his blood,
flu&s;hed with the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of his own qualifi|cations,
vain of his fortune, and elated on the
<PB N="263" REF="272">
wings of imaginary expectation. Tho' he was
deeply enamoured of mi&s;s Gauntlet, he was far
from propo&s;ing her heart as the ultimate aim of
his gallantry, which (he did not doubt) would
triumph o'er the mo&s;t illu&s;trious females of the
land, and at once regale his appetite and am|bition.</P>
<P>Mean while, being willing to make his ap|pearance
at the gari&s;on equally &s;urpri&s;ing and
agreeable, he cautioned Mr. Jolter again&s;t writ|ing
to the commodore, who had not heard of
them &s;ince their departure from Paris, and hired a
po&s;t-chai&s;e and hor&s;es for London. The gover|nor
going out to give orders about the carriage,
inadvertently left a paper book open upon the
table; and his pupil ca&s;ting his eyes upon the
page, chanced to read the&s;e words: &startq;Sept. 15.
Arrived in &s;afety, by the ble&s;&s;ing of God, in this
unhappy kingdom of England. And thus con|cludes
the journal of my la&s;t peregrination.&endq; Pe|regrine's
curio&s;ity being inflamed by this extraor|dinary
conclu&s;ion, he turned to the beginning,
and peru&s;ed &s;everal &s;heets of a diary, &s;uch as is
commonly kept by that cla&s;s of people known by
the denomination of travelling governors, for the
&s;atisfaction of them&s;elves and the parents or guar|dians
of their pupils, and for the edification and
entertainment of their friends.</P>
<P>That the reader may have a clear idea of Mr.
Jolter's performance, we &s;hall tran&s;cribe the
tran&s;actions of one day, as he had recorded them;
and that ab&s;tract will be a &s;ufficient &s;pecimen of
the whole plan and execution of the work.</P>
<P>&startq;May 3. At eight o'clock &s;et out from Bou|logne
in a po&s;t-chai&s;e: the morning hazy and
cold. Fortified my &s;tomach with a cordial. Re|commended
<PB N="264" REF="273">
ditto to Mr. P. as an antidote again&s;t
the fog. Mem. He refu&s;ed it. The hither hor&s;e
grea&s;ed in the off-pa&s;tern of the hind-leg. Arrive
at Samers. Mem. This la&s;t was a po&s;t and a
half; i. e. three leagues, or nine Engli&s;h miles.
The day clears up. A fine champain country,
well &s;tored with corn. The po&s;tilion &s;ays his
prayers in pa&s;&s;ing by a wooden crucifix upon the
road. Mem. The hor&s;es &s;taled in a &s;mall brook
that runs in a bottom, betwixt two hills. Arrive
at Cormont. A common po&s;t, A di&s;pute with
my pupil, who is ob&s;tinate, and &s;wayed by an un|lucky
prejudice. Proceed to Montreuil, where
we dine on choice pigeons. A very moderate
charge. No chamberpot in the room; owing to
the negligence of the maid. This an ordinary
po&s;t. Set out again for Nampont. Troubled
with flatulencies and indige&s;tion. Mr. P. is &s;ul|len,
and &s;eems to mi&s;take an eructation for the
breaking of wind backwards. From Nampont
depart for Bernay, at which place we arrive in
the evening, and propo&s;e to &s;tay all night. N. B.
The two la&s;t are double po&s;ts, and our cattle
very willing, tho' not &s;trong. Sup on a deli|cate
ragout and excellent partridges, in company
with Mr. H. and his &s;pou&s;e. Mem. The &s;aid H$
trod upon my corn by mi&s;take. Di&s;charge the
bill, which is not very rea&s;onable. Di&s;pute with
Mr. P. about giving money to the &s;ervant: he
in&s;i&s;ts upon my giving a twenty-four &s;ol piece;
which is too much by two thirds, in all con|&s;cience.
N. B. She was a pert baggage, and did
not de&s;erve a liard.&endq;</P>
<P>Our hero was &s;o much di&s;obliged with certain
circum&s;tances of this amu&s;ing and in&s;tructing
journal, that, by way of puni&s;hing the author,
<PB N="265" REF="274">
he interlined the&s;e words betwixt two paragraphs,
in a manner that exactly re&s;embled the tutor's
hand-writing; &startq;Mem. Had the plea&s;ure of
drinking my&s;elf into a &s;weet intoxication, by
toa&s;ting our lawful king, and his royal family,
among &s;ome worthy Engli&s;h fathers of the &s;ociety
of Je&s;us.&endq;</P>
<P>Having taken this revenge, he &s;et out for
London, where he waited upon tho&s;e noblemen
to whom he had letters of recommendation from
Paris; and was not only graciou&s;ly received, but
even loaded with care&s;&s;es and proffers of &s;ervice,
becau&s;e they under&s;tood he was a young gentle|man
of fortune, who, far from &s;tanding in need
of their countenance or a&s;&s;i&s;tance, would make
an u&s;eful and creditable addition to the number
of their adherents. He had the honour of dining
at their tables, in con&s;equence of pre&s;&s;ing invita|tions,
and of &s;pending &s;everal evenings with the
ladies, to whom he was particularly agreeable,
on account of his per&s;on, addre&s;s, and bleeding
freely at play.</P>
<P>Being thus initiated in the beau monde, he
thought it was high time to pay his re&s;pects to his
generous benefactor the commodore; and ac|cordingly
departed one morning, with his train,
for the gari&s;on, at which he arrived in &s;afety the
&s;ame night. When he entered the gate, which
was opened by a new &s;ervant that did not know
him, he found his old friend Hatchway &s;talking
in the yard, with a night-cap on his head, and a
pipe in his mouth; and advancing to him, took
him by the hand, before he had any intimation of
his approach. The lieutenant, thus &s;aluted by a
&s;tranger, &s;tated at him in &s;ilent a&s;toni&s;hment,
all he recollected his features, which were no
<PB N="266" REF="275">
&s;ooner known, than da&s;hing the pipe upon the
pavement, he exclaimed, &startq;Smite my cro&s;s-trees!
th'art welcome to port;&endq; and hugg'd him in his
arms with great affection. He then, by a cor|dial
&s;queeze, expre&s;&s;ed his &s;atisfaction at &s;eeing
his old &s;hip-mate Tom, who applying his whi&s;tle
to his mouth, the whole ca&s;tle ecchoed with his
performance.</P>
<P>The &s;ervants hearing the well-known &s;ound,
poured out in a tumult of joy; and under&s;tand|ing
that their young ma&s;ter was returned, rai&s;ed
&s;uch a peal of acclamation, as a&s;toni&s;hed the com|modore
and his lady, and in&s;pired Julia with &s;uch
an intere&s;ting pre&s;age, that her heart began to
throb with violence; and running out in the hurry
and perturbation of her hope, &s;he was &s;o much
overwhelmed at &s;ight of her brother, that &s;he
actually fainted in his arms. But from this trance
&s;he &s;oon awaked; and Peregrine having te&s;tified
his plea&s;ure and affection, went up &s;tairs, and pre|&s;ented
him&s;elf before his godfather and aunt.
Mrs. Trunnion ro&s;e, and received him with a
gracious embrace, ble&s;&s;ing God for his happy re|turn
from a land of impiety and vice, in which
&s;he hoped his morals had not been corrupted, nor
his principles of religion altered or impaired.
The old gentleman being confined to his chair,
was &s;truck dumb with plea&s;ure at his appearance;
and having made divers ineffectual efforts to get
up, at length di&s;charged a volley of cur&s;es again&s;t
his own limbs, and held out his hand to his god|&s;on,
who ki&s;s'd it with great re&s;pect.</P>
<P>After he had fini&s;hed his apo&s;trophe to the
gout, which was the daily and hourly &s;ubject of
his execrations, &startq;Well, my lad, (&s;aid he) I
care not how &s;oon I go to bottom, now I behold
<PB N="267" REF="276">
thee &s;afe in harbour again: and yet, I tell a
damn'd lie: I would I could keep afloat, until I
&s;hould &s;ee a lu&s;ty boy of thy begetting. Odds
my timbers! I love thee &s;o well, that I believe
thou art the &s;pawn of my own body; though I
can give no account of thy being put upon the
&s;tocks.&endq; Then turning his eye upon Pipes, who
by this time had penetrated into his apartment,
and addre&s;&s;ed him with the u&s;ual &s;alutation of
&startq;What cheer?&endq; &startq;Ahey! (cried he) are you
there, you herring-fac'd &s;on of a &s;ea-calf? What
a &s;lippery trick $ou played your old commander!
But, come, you dog, there's my fi&s;t; I forgive
you, for the love you bear to my god&s;on. Go
man your tackle, and hoi&s;t a ca&s;k of &s;trong

a pump in it, for the u&s;e of all my &s;ervants and
neighbours: and d'ye hear, let the patereroes
be fired, and the gari&s;on illuminated, as rejoicings
for the &s;afe arrival of your ma&s;ter. By the Lord!
if I had the u&s;e of the&s;e damn'd &s;hambling
thanks, I would dance an hornpipe with the be&s;t

<P>The next object of his attention was Mr. Jol|ter,
who was honoured with particular marks
of di&s;tinction, and the repeated promi&s;e of en|joying
the living in his gift, as an acknowledg|ment
of the care and di&s;cretion with which he
had &s;uperintended the education and morals of
our hero. The governor was &s;o affected by the
genero&s;ity of his patron, that the tears ran down
h$s cheeks, while he expre&s;&s;ed his gratitude, and
the infinite &s;atisfaction he felt, in contemplating
the accompli&s;hments of his pupil.</P>
<P>Mean while, Pipes did not neglect the orders
he had received: the beer was produced, the
<PB N="268" REF="277">
gates were thrown open for the admi&s;&s;ion of all
comers, the whole hou&s;e was lighted up, and the
patereroes di&s;charged in repeated vollies. Such
phaenomena could not fail to attract the notice of
the neighbourhood. The club at Tunley's were
a&s;toni&s;hed at the report of the guns, which pro|duced
various conjectures among the members of
that &s;agacious &s;ociety. The landlord ob&s;erved,
that in all likelihood the commodore was vi&s;ited
by hobgoblins, and ordered the guns to be fired
in token of di&s;tre&s;s, as he had acted twenty years
before, when he was annoyed by the &s;ame grie|vance.
The exci&s;eman, with a waggi&s;h &s;neer,
expre&s;&s;ed his apprehen&s;ion of Trunnion's death,
in con&s;equence of which, the patereroes might
be di&s;charged with an equivocal intent, either as
&s;ignals of his lady's &s;orrow or rejoicing. The
attorney &s;ignified a &s;u&s;picion of Hatchway's being
married to Mi&s;s Pickle, and that the firing and
illumination were in honour of the nuptials:
upon which Gamaliel di&s;covered &s;ome faint &s;igns
of emotion, and taking the pipe from his mouth,
gave it as his opinion, that his &s;i&s;ter was brought
to bed.</P>
<P>While they were thus bewildered in the maze
of their own imaginations, a company of coun|trymen,
who &s;at drinking in the kitchen, and
who&s;e legs were more ready than their invention,
fallied out to know the meaning of the&s;e exhibi|tions;
and under&s;tanding that there was a butt
of &s;trong beer abroach in the yard, to which
they were invited by the &s;ervants, &s;aved them|&s;elves
the trouble and expence of returning to
&s;pend the evening at the public hou&s;e, and li&s;ted
them&s;elves under the banner of Tom Pipes, who
pre&s;ided as director of this fe&s;tival.</P>
<P><PB N="269" REF="278">
The news of Peregrine's return being com|municated
to the pari&s;h, the par&s;on and three or
four neighbouring gentlemen, who were well-wi&s;hers
to our hero, immediately repaired to the
gari&s;on, in order to pay their compliments on this
happy event; and being detained to &s;upper, an
elegant entertainment was prepared by the di|rection
of Mi&s;s July, who was an excellent hou&s;e|wife;
and the commodore was &s;o invigorated
with joy, that he &s;eemed to have renewed his
age.</P>
<P>Among tho&s;e who honoured the occa&s;ion with
his pre&s;ence was Mr. Clover, the young gentle|man
that made his addre&s;&s;es to Peregrine's &s;i&s;ter;
and his heart was &s;o big with his pa&s;&s;ion, that
while the re&s;t of the company were ingro&s;&s;ed by
their cups, he &s;eized an opportunity of our hero's
being detached from the conver&s;ation, and in the
impatience of his love, conjured him to con&s;ent
to his happine&s;s; prote&s;ting, that he would com|ply
with any terms of &s;ettlement that a man of
his fortune could embrace, in favour of a young
lady who was ab&s;olute mi&s;tre&s;s of his affection.</P>
<P>Our youth thanked him very politely for his
favourable &s;entiments and honourable intention
towards his &s;i&s;ter, and told him, that at pre&s;ent
he &s;aw no rea&s;on to ob&s;truct his de&s;ire; that he
would con&s;ult Julia's own inclinations, and con|fer
with him about the means of gratifying his
wi&s;h: but, in the mean time, begg'd to be ex|cu&s;ed
from di&s;cu&s;&s;ing any point of &s;uch impor|tance
to them both, and reminding him of the
jovial purpo&s;e on which they were happily met,
promoted &s;uch a quick circulation of the bottle,
that their mirth gr$w noi&s;y and ob&s;treperous:
they broke forth into repeated peals of laughter,
<PB N="270" REF="279">
without any previous incitement, except that of
claret. The&s;e explo&s;ions were &s;ucceeded by Bac|chanalian
&s;ongs, in which the old gentleman him|&s;elf
attempted to bear a &s;hare; the &s;edate go|vernor
&s;napped time with his fingers, and the
pari&s;h-prie&s;t a&s;&s;i&s;ted in the chorus with a mo&s;t
expre&s;&s;ive nakedne&s;s of countenance. Before
midnight, they were almo&s;t all pinned to their
chai$s, as if they had been fixed by the power
of inchantment; and what rendered the con|finement
&s;till more unfortunate, every &s;ervant in
the hou&s;e was in the &s;ame &s;ituation; &s;o that they
were &s;ain to take their repo&s;e as they &s;at, and
nodded to each other like a congregation of ana|bapti&s;ts.</P>
<P>Next day, Peregrine communed with his &s;i&s;ter
on the &s;ubject of her match with Mr. Clover,
who (&s;he told him) had offered to &s;ettle a jointure
of four hundred pounds, and take her to wife,
without any expectation of a dowry. She,
moreover, gave him to under&s;tand, that in his
ab&s;ence &s;he had received &s;everal me&s;&s;ages from
her mother, commanding her to return to her fa|ther's
hou&s;e; but that &s;he had refu&s;ed to obey
the&s;e orders, by the advice and injunction of her
aunt and the commodore, which were indeed &s;e|conded
by her own inclination; becau&s;e &s;he had
all the rea&s;on in the world to believe, that her
mother only wanted an opportunity of treating
her with &s;everity and rancour: for the re&s;entment
of that lady had been carried to &s;uch indecent
lengths, that &s;eeing her daughter at church one
day, &s;he ro&s;e up before the par&s;on entered, and
reviled her with great bitterne&s;s, in the face of
the whole congregation.</P>

<P>HER brother being of opinion, that Mr.
Clover's propo&s;al was not to be neglected,
e&s;pecially as Julia's heart was engaged in his fa|vour,
communicated the affair to his uncle, who,
with the approbation of Mrs. Trunnion, declared
him&s;elf well &s;atisfied with the young man's ad|dre&s;&s;es,
and de&s;ired that they might be buckled
with all expedition, without the knowledge or

of their unnatural barbarity) &s;he was not
bound to pay the lea&s;t regard. Though our ad|venturer
entertained the &s;ame &s;entiments of the
matter, and the lover dreading &s;ome ob&s;truction,
earne&s;tly begg'd the immediate conde&s;cen&s;ion of
his mi&s;tre&s;s, &s;he could not be prevailed upon to
take &s;uch a material &s;tep, without having fir&s;t
&s;olicited the permi&s;&s;ion of her father, re&s;olved,
neverthele&s;s, to comply with the dictates of her
own heart, &s;hould his objections be frivolous or
unju&s;t.</P>
<P>Urged by this determination, her admirer
waited upon Mr. Gamaliel at the public hou&s;e,
and with the appearance of great de$erence and
re&s;pect, made him acquainted with his affection
for his daughter, communicated the particulars
of his fortune, with the terms of &s;ettlement he
was ready to make; and in conclu&s;ion told him,
that he would marry her without a portion.
This la&s;t offer &s;eemed to have &s;ome weight with
the father, who received it with civility, and
<PB N="272" REF="281">
promi&s;ed, in a day or two, to favour him with
a final an&s;wer to his demand. He, accordingly,
that &s;ame evening con&s;ulted his wife, who being
exa&s;perated at the pro&s;pect of her daughter's in|dependency,
argued with the mo&s;t virulent ex|po&s;tulation
again&s;t the match, as an impudent
&s;cheme of her own planning, with a view of in|&s;ulting
her parents, towards whom &s;he had al|ready
been guilty of the mo&s;t vicious di&s;obedience.
In &s;hort, &s;he u&s;ed &s;uch remon&s;trances, as not
only averted this weak hu&s;band's inclination from
the propo&s;al which he had reli&s;hed before, but
even in&s;tigated him to apply for a warrant to ap|prehend
his daughter, on the &s;uppo&s;ition that &s;he
was about to be&s;tow her&s;elf in marriage, without
his privity or con&s;ent.</P>
<P>The ju&s;tice of peace to whom this application
was made, though he could not refu&s;e the order,
yet, being no &s;tranger to the malevolence of the
mother, which, together with Gamaliel's &s;im|plicity,
was notorious in the county, he &s;ent an
intimation of what had happened to the gari&s;on;
upon which, a couple of centinels were placed
on the gate, and at the pre&s;&s;ing &s;olicitation of
the lover, as well as the de&s;ire of the commodore,
her brother and aunt, Julia was wedded without
further delay; the ceremony being performed by
Mr. Jolter, becau&s;e the pari&s;h-prie&s;t prudently
declined any occa&s;ion of giving offence, and the
curate was too much in the intere&s;t of their ene|mies,
to be employed in that office.</P>
<P>This dome&s;tic concern being &s;ettled to the &s;a|ti$$action
of our hero, he e&s;corted her next day
to the hou&s;e of her hu&s;band, who immediately
wrote a letter to her father, declaring his rea&s;ons
<PB N="273" REF="282">
for having thus &s;uper&s;eded his authority; and
Mrs. Pickle's mortification was un&s;peakable.</P>
<P>That the new-married couple might be guard|ed
again&s;t all in&s;ult, our young gentleman and
his friend Hatchway, with their adherents, lodged
in Mr Clover's hou&s;e for &s;ome weeks; during
which, they vi&s;ited their acquaintance in the
neighbourhood, according to cu&s;tom; and when
the tranquillity of their family was perfectly e&s;ta|bli&s;hed,
and the contract of marriage executed
in the pre&s;ence of the old commodore and his
lady, who gave her niece five hundred pounds to
purcha&s;e jewels and cloaths, Mr. Peregrine could
no longer re&s;train his impatience to &s;ee his dear
Emily; and told his uncle, that next day he pro|po&s;ed
to ride acro&s;s the country, in order to vi&s;it
his friend Gauntlet, from whom he had not heard
of a long time.</P>
<P>The old gentleman, looking &s;tedfa&s;tly in his
face, &startq;Ah! damn your cunning! (&s;aid he) I
find the anchor holds fa&s;t: I did &s;uppo&s;e as how
you would have &s;lipt your cable, and changed
your birth; but, I &s;ee, when a young fellow is
once brought up by a pretty wench, he may man
his cap&s;tans and viol block, if he wool; but he'll

his anchor aweigh! Odds heartlikins! had I
known the young woman was Ned Gauntlet's
daughter, I &s;hou'dn't have thrown out &s;ignal for
leaving off chace.&endq;</P>
<P>Our adventurer was not a little &s;urprized to
hear the commodore talk in this &s;tile; and im|mediately
conjectured, that his friend God&s;rey
had informed him of the whole affair. In&s;tead
of li&s;tening to this approbation of his f$ame, with
tho&s;e tran&s;ports of joy which he would have felt,
<PB N="274" REF="283">
had he retained his former &s;entiments, he was
chagrined at Trunnion's declaration, and offended
a$$ the pre&s;umption of the young &s;oldier, in pre|tending
to di&s;clo&s;e the &s;ecret with which he had
intru&s;ted him. Reddening with the&s;e reflections,
he a&s;&s;ured the commodore, that he never had &s;e|rious
thoughts of matrimony: &s;o that, if any per|&s;on
had told him he was under any engagement
of that kind, he had abu&s;ed his ear; for, he pro|te&s;ted,
that he would never contract &s;uch at|tachments,
without his knowledge and expre&s;s
permi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Trunnion commended him for his prudent re|&s;olution,
and ob&s;erved, that though no per&s;on
mentioned to him what promi&s;es had pa&s;&s;ed be|twixt
him and his &s;weetheart, it was very plain
that he had made love to her; and therefore, it
was to be &s;uppo&s;ed, that his intentions were ho|nourable:
for, he could not believe he was &s;uch a
r$gue in his heart, as to endeavour to debauch
the daughter of a brave officer, who had &s;erved
his country with credit and reputation. Not|with&s;tanding
this remon&s;trance, which Pickle
imputed to the commodore's ignorance of the
world, he &s;et out for the habitation of Mrs.
Gauntlet, with the unju&s;tifiable &s;entiments of a
man of plea&s;ure, who &s;acrifices every con&s;idera|tion
to the de&s;ire of his ruling appetite; and as
Winche&s;ter lay in his way, re&s;olved to vi&s;it &s;ome
of his friends who lived in that place. It was in
the hou&s;e of one of the&s;e, that he was informed
of Emilia's being then in town with her mother;
upon which, he excu&s;ed him&s;elf from &s;taying to
drink tea, and immediately repaired to their
lodgings, according to the direction he had re|ceived.</P>
<P><PB N="275" REF="284">
When he arrived at the door, in&s;tead of un|dergoing
that perturbation of &s;pirits, which a
lover, in his intere&s;ting &s;ituation, might be &s;up|po&s;ed
to feel, he &s;uffered no emotion but that of
vanity and pride, favoured with an opportunity
of &s;elf-gratification, and entered his Emilia's
apartment with the air of a conceited petit maitre,
rather than that of the re&s;pectful admirer, when
he vi&s;its the object of his pa&s;&s;ion, after an ab|&s;ence
of &s;eventeen months.</P>
<P>The young lady having been very much di&s;|obliged
at his mortifying neglect of her brother's
letter, had &s;ummoned all her own pride and re|&s;olution
to her aid; and by means of a happy di&s;|po&s;ition,
&s;o far overcame her chagrin at his in|difference,
that &s;he was able to behave in his pre|&s;ence
with apparent tranquillity and ea&s;e. She
was even plea&s;ed to find, he had by accident
cho&s;en a time for his vi&s;it, when &s;he was &s;ur|rounded
by two or three young gentlemen, who
pro&s;e&s;&s;ed them&s;elves her admirers. Our gallant
was no &s;ooner anounced, than &s;he collected all
her coquettry, put on the gaye&s;t air &s;he could a&s;|&s;ume,
and contrived to giggle ju&s;t as he appeared
at the room-door. The compliments of &s;aluta|tion
being performed, &s;he welcomed him to Eng|gland
in a carele&s;s manner, a&s;ked the news of
Paris, and, before he could make any reply, de|&s;ired
one of the other gentlemen to proceed with
the &s;equel of that comical adventure, in the re|lation
of which he had been interrupted.</P>
<P>Peregrine &s;miled within him&s;elf at this beha|viour,
which (without all doubt he believed) &s;he
had affected to puni&s;h him for his unkind &s;ilence,
while he was abroad; being fully per&s;uaded, that
her heart was ab&s;olutely at his devotion. On
<PB N="276" REF="285">
this &s;uppo&s;ition, he practi&s;ed his Pari&s;ian improve|ments
on the art of conver&s;ation, and uttered a
thou&s;and prettine&s;&s;es in the way of compliment,
with &s;uch incredible rotation of tongue, that his
rivals were &s;truck dumb with a&s;toni&s;hment; and
Emilia fretted out of all temper, at &s;eeing her|&s;elf
deprived of the prerogative of the &s;ex. He
per&s;i&s;ted, however, in this &s;urpri&s;ing loquacity,
until the re&s;t of the company thought proper to
withdraw, and then contracted his di&s;cour&s;e into
the focus of love, which now put on a very di$|ferent
appearance from that which it had for|merly
worn. In&s;tead of that awful veneration
which her pre&s;ence u&s;ed to in&s;pire, that cha&s;tity
of &s;entiment and delicacy of expre&s;&s;ion, he now
gazed upon her with the eyes of a libertine, he
glowed with the impatience of de&s;ire, talked in
a &s;train that barely kept within the bounds of
decency, and attempted to &s;natch &s;uch favours as
&s;he, in the tenderne&s;s of mutual acknowledge|ment,
had once vouch&s;afed to be&s;tow.</P>
<P>Grieved and offended as &s;he was, at this pal|pable
alteration in his carriage, &s;he di&s;dained to
remind him of his former deportment, and with
di&s;&s;embled good humour, rallied him on the
progre&s;s he had made in gallantry and addre&s;s:
but, far from &s;ubmitting to the liberties he would
have taken, &s;he kept her per&s;on &s;acred from his
touch, and would not even &s;uffer him to ravi&s;h
a ki&s;s of her fair hand: &s;o that he reaped no other
advantage from the exerci&s;e of his talents, du|ring
this interview, which la&s;ted a whole hour,
than that of knowing he had over-rated his own
importance; and that Emily's heart was not a
ga$$&s;on likely to &s;urrender at di&s;cretion.</P>
<P><PB N="277" REF="286">
At length, his addre&s;&s;es were interrupted by
the arrival of the mother, who had gone abroad
to vi&s;it by her&s;elf; and the conver&s;ation be|coming
more general, he under&s;tood, that God|frey
was at London, &s;oliciting for a lieutenancy
that had fallen vacant in the regiment to which
he belonged; and that Mi&s;s Sophy was at home
with her father.</P>
<P>Though our adventurer had not met with all
the &s;ucce&s;s he expected in his fir&s;t vi&s;it, he did
not de&s;pair of reducing the fortre&s;s, believing that
in time there would be a mutiny in his favour;
and accordingly, carried on the &s;iege for &s;everal
days, without profiting by his per&s;everance; till
at length, having attended the ladies to their
own hou&s;e in the country, he began to look
upon this adventure as time mi&s;pent, and re|&s;olved
to di&s;continue his attack, in hopes of meet|ing
with a more favourable occa&s;ion; being, in

of friend&s;hip, which might have been expected
from the intimacy of their former connexion.
Nor was Peregrine him&s;elf actuated by the &s;ame

not to be imputed to any other cau&s;e: and he
hoped Mr. Pickle would acquit him of all &s;hare
in the tran&s;action.</P>
<P>Peregrine was very well plea&s;ed to be thus un|deceived;
his countenance immediately cleared
up, the formality of his behaviour relaxed into
his u&s;ual familiarity; he a&s;ked pardon for his un|mannerly
neglect of Godfrey's letter, which, he
prote&s;ted, was not owing to any di&s;regard, or
abatement of friend&s;hip, but to a hurry of youth|ful
engagements, in con&s;equence of which, he
had procra&s;tinated his an&s;wer from time to time,
until he was ready to return in per&s;on.</P>
<P>The young &s;oldier was contented with this
apology; and as Pickle's intention, with re&s;pect
to his &s;i&s;ter, was &s;till dubious and undeclared, he
did not think it was incumbent upon him, as
yet, to expre&s;s any re&s;entment on that &s;core;
but was wi&s;e enough to fore&s;ee, that the re|newal
of his intimacy with our young gentleman,
might be the means of reviving that flame which
had been di&s;&s;ipated by a variety of new ideas.
With tho&s;e &s;entiments he laid a&s;ide all re&s;erve,
and their communication immediately re&s;umed its
former channel. Peregrine made him acquainted
with all the adventures in which he had been en|gaged
&s;ince their parting; and he, with the &s;ame
confidence, related the remarkable incidents of
his own fate; among other things, giving him
to under&s;tand, that upon obtaining a commi&s;&s;ion
in the army, the father of his dear Sophy, with|out
once inquiring about the occa&s;ion of his pro|motion,
had not only favoured him with his
countenance in a much greater degree than here|tofore,
but al&s;o contributed his intere&s;t, and even
promi&s;ed the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of his pur&s;e, in procuring
<PB N="281" REF="290">
for him a lieutenancy, which he was then &s;oli|citing
with all his power; whereas, if he had
not been enabled, by a mo&s;t accidental piece of
good fortune, to lift him&s;elf into the &s;phere of
an officer, he had all the rea&s;on in the world to
believe, that this gentleman, and all the re&s;t of
his wealthy relations, would have &s;uffered him to
langui&s;h in ob&s;curity and di&s;tre&s;s; and, by turn|ing
his misfortune into reproach, made it a plea
for their own want of genero&s;ity and friend|&s;hip.</P>
<P>Peregrine, under&s;tanding this &s;ituation of his
friend's affairs, would have accommodated him,
upon the in&s;tant, with a &s;um to accelerate the
pa&s;&s;age of his commi&s;&s;ion through the offices;
but, being too well acquainted with his &s;crupu|lous
di&s;po&s;ition, to manife&s;t his benevolence in
that manner, he found means to introduce him|&s;elf
to one of the gentlemen of the war-office,
who was &s;o well &s;atisfied with the arguments he
u&s;ed in behalf of his friend, that Godfrey's bu|&s;ine&s;s
was tran&s;acted in a very few days, though
he him&s;elf knew nothing of his intere&s;t's being
thus rein&s;orced.</P>
<P>By this time, the &s;ea&s;on at Bath was begun;
and our hero, panting with the de&s;ire of di&s;tin|gui&s;hing
him&s;elf at that re&s;ort of the fa&s;hionable
world, communicated his de&s;ign of going thither
to his friend Godfrey, whom he importuned to
accompany him in the excur&s;ion: and leave of
ab&s;ence from his regiment being obtained, by
the influence of Peregrine's new quality-friends,
the two companions departed from London in a
po&s;t-chaife, attended, as u&s;ual, by the valet de
chambre and Pipes, who were become almo&s;t as
<PB N="282" REF="291">
nece&s;&s;ary to our adventurer as any two of his
own organs.</P>
<P>At the inn, when they alighted for dinner,
Godf$ey perceived a per&s;on walking by him&s;elf
in the yard, with a very pen&s;ive air, and upon
ob&s;erving him more narrowly, recognized him
to be a profe&s;&s;ed game&s;ter, whom he had for|merly
known at Tunbridge. On the &s;trength
of this acquaintance, he acco&s;ted the peripatetic,
who knew him immediately; and, in the ful|ne&s;s
of his grief and vexation, told him, that he
was now on his return from Bath, where he had
been &s;tripp'd by a company of &s;harpers, who re|&s;ented
that he &s;hould pre&s;ume to trade upon his
own bottom.</P>
<P>Peregrine, who was extremely curious in his
inquiries, imagining that he might learn &s;ome
entertaining and u&s;eful anecdotes from this arti&s;t,
invited him to dinner, and was accordingly fully
informed of all the political &s;y&s;tems at the Bath.
He under&s;tood, that there was at London one
great company of adventurers, who employed
agents, in all the different branches of impo&s;i|tion,
throughout the whole kingdom of Eng|land,
allowing the&s;e mini&s;ters a certain propor|tion
of the profits accruing from their indu&s;try
and &s;kill, and re&s;erving the greate&s;t &s;hare for the
benefit of the common &s;tock, which was charge|able
with the expence of fitting out individuals
in their various pur&s;uits, as well as with the lo&s;s
&s;u&s;tained in the cour&s;e of their adventures. Some,
who&s;e per&s;ons and qualifications are by the com|pany
judged adequate to the ta&s;k, exert their ta|lents
in making love to ladies of fortune, being
accommodated with money and accoutrements
<PB N="283" REF="292">
for that purpo&s;e, after having given their bonds
payable to one or other of the directors, on the
day of marriage, for certain &s;ums, proportioned
to the dowries they are to receive. Others,
ver&s;ed in the doctrine of chances, and certain
&s;ecret expedients, frequent all tho&s;e places where
games of hazard are allowed; and &s;uch as are
ma&s;ters in the arts of billiards, tennis and bowls,
are continually lying in wait, in all the &s;cenes of
the&s;e diver&s;ions, for the ignorant and unwary.
A fourth cla&s;s attend hor&s;e-races, being &s;killed in
tho&s;e my&s;terious practices, by which the knowing|ones
are taken in. Nor is this community un|furni&s;hed
with tho&s;e who lay wanton wives and
old rich widows under contribution, and extort
money, by pro&s;tituting them&s;elves to the em|braces
of their own &s;ex, and then threatening
their admirers with pro&s;ecution. But their mo&s;t
important returns are made by that body of their
undertakers who exerci&s;e their under&s;tandings in
the innumerable &s;tratagems of the card table, at
which no &s;harper can be too infamous to be re|ceived,
and even care&s;&s;ed by per&s;ons of the highe&s;t
rank and di&s;tinction. Among other articles of
intelligence, our young gentleman learn'd, that
tho&s;e agents, by whom their gue&s;t was broke,
and expelled from Bath, had con&s;tituted a bank
again&s;t all &s;porters, and monopolized the ad|vantage
in all &s;orts of play. He then told Gaunt|let,
that if he would put him&s;elf under his di|rection,
he would return with them, and lay
&s;uch a &s;cheme, as would infallibly ruin the whole
&s;ociety at billiards, as he knew that Godfrey ex|celled
them all in his knowledge of that game.</P>
<P>The &s;oldier excu&s;ed him&s;elf from engaging in
any party of that kind; and after dinner the tra|vellers
<PB N="284" REF="293">
parted; but, as the conver&s;ation between
the two friends turned upon the information
they had received, Peregrine projected a plan for
puni&s;hing tho&s;e villanous pe&s;ts of &s;ociety, who
prey upon their fellow creatures; and it was put
in execution by Gauntlet, in this manner.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. LXXIV.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Godfrey executes a &s;cheme at Bath, by which a
whole company of &s;harpers is ruined.</HEAD>
<P>ON the evening after their arrival at Bath,
Godfrey, who had kept him&s;elf up all day
for that purpo&s;e, went in boots to the billiard
table; and two gentlemen being at play, began
to bet with &s;o little appearance of judgment, that
one of the adventurers then pre&s;ent was inflamed
with the de&s;ire of profiting by his inexperience;
and when the table was vacant, invited him to
take a game for amu&s;ement. The &s;oldier, a&s;|&s;uming
the air of a &s;elf-conceited dupe, an&s;wer|ed,
that he did not choo&s;e to throw away his
time for nothing, but, if he plea&s;ed, would
p$ddle for a crown a game. This declaration
was very agreeable to the other, who wanted to
be further confirmed in the opinion he had con|ceived
of the &s;tranger, before he would play for
any thing of con&s;equence. The partie being ac|cepted,
Gauntlet put off his coat, and beginning
with &s;eeming eagerne&s;s, won the fir&s;t game, be|cau&s;e
his antagoni&s;t kept up his play, with a view
of encouraging him to wager a greater &s;um. The
&s;oldier purpo&s;ely bit at the hook, the &s;takes were
doubled, and he was again victorious, by the
permi&s;&s;ion of his competitor. He now began to
<PB N="285" REF="294">
yawn; and ob&s;erving, that it was not worth his
while to proceed in &s;uch a childi&s;h manner, the
other &s;wore, in an affected pa&s;&s;ion, that he would
play with him for twenty guineas. The propo|&s;al
being embraced (thro' the connivance of God|frey)
the money was won by the &s;harper, who
exerted his dexterity to the uttermo&s;t, fearing
that otherwi&s;e his adver&s;ary would decline con|tinuing
the game.</P>
<P>Godfrey thus conquered, pretended to lo&s;e his
temper, curs'd his own ill luck, &s;wore that the
table had a ca&s;t, and that the balls did not run
true, changed his ma&s;t, and with great warmth
challenged his enemy to double the &s;um. The
game&s;ter, with feigned reluctance, complied with
his de&s;ire, and having got the fir&s;t two hazards,
offered to lay one hundred guineas to fifty on the
game. The odds were taken; and Godfrey
having allowed him&s;elf to be overcome, began
to rage with great violence, broke the ma&s;t to
pieces, threw the balls out at the window, and,
in the fury of his indignation, defied his antago|ni&s;t
to meet him to-morrow, when he &s;hould be
refre&s;hed from the fatigue of travelling. This
was a very welcome invitation to the game&s;ter,
who imagining that the &s;oldier would turn out a
mo&s;t beneficial prize, a&s;&s;ured him, that he would
not fail to be there next forenoon, in order to
give him his revenge.</P>
<P>Gauntlet went home to his lodgings, fully
certified of his own &s;uperiority; and took his
mea&s;ures with Peregrine, touching the pro&s;ecu|tion
of their &s;cheme; while his opponent made
a report of his &s;ucce&s;s to the brethren of the gang,
who re&s;olved to be pre&s;ent at the deci&s;ion of the
<PB N="286" REF="295">
match, with the view of taking advantage of the
&s;tranger's pa&s;&s;ionate di&s;po&s;ition.</P>
<P>Affairs being thus concerted on both &s;ides, the
players met, according to appointment, and the
room was immediately filled with &s;pectators, who
either came thither by accident, curio&s;ity, or de|&s;ign.
The match was fixed for one hundred
pounds a game, the principals cho&s;e their in&s;tru|ments,
and laid a&s;ide their coats, and one of the
knights of the order proffered to lay another hun|dred
on the head of his a&s;&s;ociate. Godfrey took
him up on the in&s;tant. A &s;econd worthy of the
&s;ame cla&s;s &s;eeing him &s;o eager, challenged him to
treble the &s;um; and his propo&s;al met with the
&s;ame reception, to the a&s;toni&s;hment of the com|pany,
who&s;e expectation was rai&s;ed to a very in|tere&s;ting
pitch. The game was begun, and the
&s;oldier having lo&s;t the fir&s;t hazard, the odds were
offered by the confederacy, with great vocifera|tion;
but no body would run &s;uch a ri&s;k, in fa|vour
of a per&s;on who was utterly unknown. The
&s;harper having gained the &s;econd al&s;o, the noi&s;e
increa&s;ed to a &s;urpri&s;ing clamour, not only of the
gang, but likewi&s;e of almo&s;t all the &s;pectators,
who de&s;ired to lay two to one again&s;t the brother
of Emilia.</P>
<P>Peregrine, who was pre&s;ent, perceiving the
cupidity of the a&s;&s;ociation &s;ufficiently inflamed,
all of a &s;udden opened his mouth, and an&s;wered
their betts, to the amount of twelve hundred
pounds; which were immediately depo&s;ited, on
both &s;ides, in money and notes: &s;o that this was
(perhaps) the mo&s;t important game that ever was
plaid at billiards. Gauntlet &s;eeing the agreement
&s;ettled, &s;truck his antagoni&s;t's ball into the pocket,
in a twinkling, tho' it was in one of tho&s;e &s;ituations
<PB N="287" REF="296">
which are &s;uppo&s;ed to be again&s;t the &s;triker. The
betters were a little di&s;compo&s;ed at this event,
for which, however, they con&s;oled them&s;elves,
by imputing the &s;ucce&s;s to accident; but when,
at the very next &s;troke, he &s;prung it over the
table, their countenances underwent an in&s;tanta|neous
di&s;traction of feature, and they waited, in
the mo&s;t dreadful &s;u&s;pen&s;e, for the next hazard,
which being likewi&s;e taken, with infinite ea&s;e, by
the &s;oldier, the blood for&s;ook their cheeks, and
the interjection <HI>Zounds!</HI> pronounced with a look
of con&s;ternation, and in a tone of de&s;pair, pro|ceeded
from every mouth, at the &s;ame in&s;tant of
time. They were overwhelmed with horror and
a&s;toni&s;hment at &s;eeing three hazards taken in as
many &s;trokes, from a per&s;on of their friend's
dexterity; and &s;hrewdly &s;u&s;pected, that the
whole was a &s;cheme preconcerted for their de|&s;truction:
on this &s;uppo&s;ition they changed the
note, and attempted to effect their own indemni|fication,
by propo&s;ing to lay the odds in favour of
Gauntlet; but &s;o much was the opinion of the
company altered by that young gentleman's &s;uc|ce&s;s,
that no body would venture to e&s;pou&s;e the
cau&s;e of his competitor, who chancing to improve
his game by the addition of another lucky hit,
dimini&s;hed the concern, and revived the hopes of
his adherents. But, this gleam of fortune, did
not long continue: Godfrey collected his whole
art and capacity, and augmenting his &s;core to
number ten, indulged him&s;elf with a view of the
whole fra$e$nity. The vi&s;ages of the&s;e profe&s;|&s;ors
had adopted different &s;ha$es of complexion,
at every hazard he had taken; from their natural
colour they had &s;hi$ted into a &s;a$ow $word$; from
thence into pale; from pale into yellow, wh$ch
<PB N="288" REF="297">
degenerated into a mahogony tint; and now they
&s;aw &s;eventeen hundred pounds of their &s;tock de|pending
upon a &s;ingle &s;troke, they &s;tood like &s;o
many &s;warthy Moors, jaundiced with terror and
vexation. The fire which naturally glowed in
the cheeks and no&s;e of the player, &s;eemed ut|terly
extinct, and his carbuncles exhibited a livid
appearance, as if a gangrene had already made
&s;ome progre&s;s in his face; his hand began to
&s;hake, and his whole frame was &s;eized with &s;uch
trepidation, that he was fain to &s;wallow a bumper
of brandy, in order to re-e&s;tabli&s;h the tranquil|lity
of his nerves. This expedient, however,
did not produce the de&s;ired effect; for he aimed
the ball at the lead with &s;uch di&s;compo&s;ure, that
it &s;truck on the wrong &s;ide, and came off at an
angle which directed it full in the middle hole.
This fatal accident was attended with an uni|ver&s;al
groan, as if the whole univer&s;e had gone
to wreck: and notwith&s;tanding that tranquillity
for which adventurers are &s;o remarkable, this
lo&s;s made &s;uch an impre&s;&s;ion upon them all, that
each, in particular, manife&s;ted his chagrin, by
the mo&s;t violent emotions. One turned up his
eyes to heaven, and bit his nether lip; another
gnawed his fingers, while he &s;talked acro&s;s the
room; a third bla&s;phemed with horrible impre|cations;
and he who played the partie, &s;neaked
off, grinding his teeth together, with a look that
baffles all de&s;cription, and as he cro&s;&s;ed the
thre&s;hold, exclaiming, &startq;A damn'd bite, by
G&mdash;d!&endq;</P>
<P>The victors, after having in&s;ulted them, by
a&s;king if they were di&s;po&s;ed for another chance,
carried off their winning, with the appearance of
great compo&s;ure, though in their hearts they
<PB N="289" REF="298">
were tran&s;ported with un&s;peakable joy; not &s;o
much on account of the booty they had gained,
as in con&s;ideration of having &s;o effectually de|&s;troyed
&s;uch a ne&s;t of pernicious mi&s;creants.</P>
<P>Peregrine believing, that now he had found
an opportunity of &s;erving his friend, without gi|ving
offence to the delicacy of his honour, told
him, upon their arrival at their lodgings, that
fortune had at length enabled him to become in
a manner independent, or at lea&s;t to make him|&s;elf
ea&s;y in his circum&s;tances, by purcha&s;ing a
company with the money he had won. So &s;ay|ing,
he put his &s;hare of the &s;ucce&s;s in Gauntlet's
hand, as a &s;um that of right belonged to him,
and promi&s;ed to write in his behalf to a noble|man,
who had intere&s;t enough to promote &s;uch a
quick ri&s;e in the &s;ervice.</P>
<P>Godfrey thanked him for his obliging inten|tion,
but ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed, with great loftine&s;s
of demeanour, to appropriate to his own u&s;e any
part of the money which Pickle had gained, and
&s;eemed affronted at the other's entertaining a &s;en|timent
&s;o unworthy of his character. He would
not even accept, in the way of loan, &s;uch an
addition to his own &s;tock, as would amount to
the price of a company of foot; but expre&s;&s;ed
great confidence in the future exertion of that ta|lent
which had been ble&s;&s;ed with &s;uch a pro&s;pe|rous
beginning. Our hero &s;inding him thus ob|&s;timately
deaf to the voice of his own intere&s;t,
re&s;olved to govern him&s;elf in his next endeavours
$word$ $riend&s;hip, by his experience of th$s ti$kli&s;h
$word$; and in the mean time, gave a $word$
ben$$action to the ho&s;pital, out of the&s;e
$word$ fruits of his &s;ucce&s;s in play, and re&s;erved two
<PB N="290" REF="299">
hundred pounds for a &s;et of diamond ear-rings and
&s;olitaire, which he intended for a pre&s;ent to
Mi&s;s Emily.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">The two friends eclip&s;e all their competitors in gal|lantry,
and practi&s;e a plea&s;ant project of revenge
upon the phy&s;icians of the place.</HEAD>
<P>THE &s;ame of their exploit again&s;t the &s;harpers,
was immediately diffu&s;ed through all com|panies
at the Bath; &s;o that when our adventurers
appeared in public, they were pointed out by an
hundred extended fingers, and con&s;idered as con|&s;ummate
arti&s;ts in all the different &s;pecies of fi|ne&s;&s;e,
which they would not fail to practi&s;e with
the fir&s;t opportunity. Nor was this opinion of
their characters any ob&s;tacle to their reception
into the fa&s;hionable parties in the place; but, on
the contrary, &s;uch a recommendation, which (as
I have already hinted) never fails to operate for
the advantage of the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or.</P>
<P>This fir&s;t adventure, therefore, &s;erved them as
an introduction to the company at Bath, who
were not a little &s;urprized to find their expecta|tions
baffled by the conduct of the two compa|nions;
becau&s;e, far from engaging deeply at
play, they rather &s;hunned all occa&s;ions of gaming,
and directed their attention to gallantry, in
which our hero &s;hone unrivalled. His external
qualifications, exclu&s;ive of any other merit, were
&s;trong enough to captivate the common run of
the female &s;ex; and the&s;e, reinforced with a
&s;prightline&s;s of conver&s;ation, and a mo&s;t in&s;i|nuating
<PB N="291" REF="300">
addre&s;s, became irre&s;i&s;tible, even by
tho&s;e who were fortified with pride, caution or
indifference. But, among all the nymphs of this
gay place, he did not meet with one object that
di&s;puted the empire of his heart with Emilia;
and therefore he divided his attachment according
to the &s;ugge&s;tions of vanity and whim; &s;o that,
before he had re&s;ided a fortnight at the Bath, he
had &s;et all the ladies by the cars, and furni&s;hed
all the hundred tongues of &s;candal with full em|ployment.
The &s;plendor of his appearance ex|cited
the inquiries of envy, which, in&s;tead of
di&s;covering any circum&s;tance to his prejudice,
was cur&s;ed with the information of his being a
young gentleman of a good family, and heir to
an immen&s;e fortune.</P>
<P>The countenance of &s;ome of his quality|friends,
who arrived at Bath, confirmed this
piece of intelligence: upon wh$ch, his acquain|tance
was c$urted and cultivated with great a&s;&s;i|duity;
and he met with &s;uch advances from &s;ome
of the fair &s;$x, as rendered him extremely fortu|nate
in his amours. Nor was $is $riend Godfrey
a &s;tranger to favours of the &s;ame kind; his ac|compli&s;hments
were exactly calculated for the
$$ridian of fema$e ta&s;te; and w$th certain indi|v$duals
of that $$x, his n$cular frame, and the
retru&s;t connection of his $word$, were more at|tractive
than the delicate proportions of his com|$$$$$n.
He accordingly reigned paramount $mong
$word$ inamorat$s who were turned of $word$,
without being under the nece&s;&s;ity of proceeding
by $span$ and wa$ thought to have $word$

at fight of an hand&s;ome young man, to
the &s;taid maiden of twenty-eight, who with a
demure a&s;pect moralizes on the vanity of beauty,
the folly of youth and &s;implicity of woman, and
expatiates on friend&s;hip, benevolence and good
&s;en&s;e, in the &s;tile of a platonic philo&s;opher.</P>
<P>In &s;uch a diver&s;ity of di&s;po&s;itions, his conque&s;ts
were attended with all the heart-burnings, ani|mo&s;ities

experience and &s;ubtilty of invention. Not one
day pa&s;&s;ed, in which &s;ome new &s;tory did not cir|culate,
to the prejudice of one or other of tho&s;e
rivals.</P>
<P>If our hero, in the long-room, chanced to
quit one of the morali&s;ts, with whom he had
been engaged in conver&s;ation, he was immediately
acco&s;ted by a number of the oppo&s;ite faction,
who, with ironical &s;miles, upbraided him with
cruelty to the poor lady he had left, exhorted
him to have compa&s;&s;ion on her &s;ufferings, and
turning their eyes towards the object of their in|terce&s;&s;ion,
broke forth into an univer&s;al peal of
laughter. On the other hand, when Peregrine,
in con&s;equence of having danced with one of the
<PB N="293" REF="302">
minors over-night, vi&s;ited her in the morning,
the Platoni&s;ts immediately laid hold on the occa|&s;ion,
ta&s;ked their imaginations, a&s;&s;ociated ideas,
and in &s;age in&s;inuations retailed a thou&s;and cir|cum&s;tances
of the interview, which never had
any foundation in truth. They ob&s;erved, that
if girls are determined to behave with &s;uch indi&s;|cretion,
they mu&s;t lay their accounts with in|curring
the cen&s;ure of the world; that &s;he in
que&s;tion, was old enough to act more circum|&s;pectly;
and wondered that her mother would
permit any young fellow to approach the cham|ber,
while her daughter was in naked bed. As
for the &s;ervant's peeping through the key-hole, to
be &s;ure it was an unlucky accident; but people
ought to be upon their guard again&s;t &s;uch curio|&s;ity,
and give their dome&s;tics no cau&s;e to employ
their penetration. The&s;e, and other &s;uch re|flections,
were occa&s;ionally whi&s;pered as &s;ecrets
among tho&s;e who were known to be communi|cative;
&s;o that, in a few hours, it became the
general topic of di&s;cour&s;e; and as it had been di|vulged
under injunctions of &s;ecrecy, it was almo&s;t
impo&s;&s;ible to trace the &s;candal to its origin; be|cau&s;e
every per&s;on concerned, mu&s;t have pro|mulgated
her own breach of tru&s;t, in di&s;covering
her author of the report.</P>
<P>Peregrine, in&s;tead of allaying, rather exa&s;|perated
this contention, by an artful di&s;tribution
of his attention among the competitors; well
knowing, that &s;hould his regard be converged into
one point, he would &s;oon forfeit the plea&s;ure he
enjoyed, in &s;eeing them at variance; for both
parties would join again&s;t the common enemy,
and his favourite would be per&s;ecuted by the
whole coalition. He perceived, that among the
<PB N="294" REF="303">
&s;ecret agents of &s;candal, none were &s;o bu&s;y as
the phy&s;icians, a cla&s;s of animals who live in this
place, like &s;o many ravens hovering about a car|ca&s;e,
and even ply for employment, like &s;cu$ers
at Hungerford-&s;tairs. The greate&s;t part of them
have corre&s;pondents in London, who make it
their bu&s;ine&s;s to inquire into the hi&s;tory, cha|racter,
and di&s;temper of every one that repairs to
Bath, for the benefit of the waters; and if they
cannot procure intere&s;t to recommend their me|dical
friends to the&s;e patients, before they &s;et
out, they at lea&s;t furni&s;h them with a previous
account of what they could collect, that their
corre&s;pondents may u&s;e this intelligence for their
own advantage. By the&s;e means, and the a&s;|&s;i&s;tance
of flattery and a&s;&s;urance, they often in|&s;inuate
them&s;elves into the acquaintance of &s;tran|gers,
and by con&s;ulting their di&s;po&s;itions, become
nece&s;&s;ary and &s;ub&s;ervient to their prevailing po&s;|&s;ions.
By their connexion with apothecaries and
nur&s;es, they are informed of all the private oc|currences
in each family; and therefore, enabled
to gratify the rancour of malice, amu&s;e the &s;pleen
of peevi&s;h indi&s;po&s;ition, and entertain the eager|ne&s;s
of impertient curio&s;ity.</P>
<P>In the cour&s;e of the&s;e occupations, which fre|quently
affected the reputation of our two ad|venturers,
this whole body fell under the di&s;|plea&s;ure
of our hero, who, after divers con&s;ulta|tions
with his friend, concerted a &s;tratagem,
which was practi&s;ed upon the faculty in this man|ner.
Among tho&s;e who frequented the pump|room,
was an old officer, who&s;e temper, natu|rally
impatient, was, by repeated attacks of the
geut, which had almo&s;t deprived him of the u&s;e
of his limbs, &s;ublimated into a remarkable degree
<PB N="295" REF="304">
of virulence and perver&s;ene&s;s: he imputed the
inveteracy of his di&s;temper to the male practice
of a &s;urgeon who had admini&s;tered to him, while
he laboured under the con&s;equences of an unfor|tunate
amour; and this &s;uppo&s;ition had in&s;pired
him with an in&s;urmountable antipathy to all the
profe&s;&s;ors of the medical art, which was more
and more confirmed by the information of a friend
at London, who had told him, that it was a
common practice among the phy&s;icians at Bath,
to di&s;&s;uade their patients from drinking the water,
that the cure, and of con&s;equence their atten|dance,
might be the longer protracted.</P>
<P>Thus prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, he had come to Bath, and,
conformable to a few general in&s;tructions he had
received, u&s;ed the waters without any farther
direction, taking all occa&s;ions of manife&s;ting his
hatred and contempt of the &s;ons of Ae&s;culapius,
both by &s;peech and ge&s;ticulations, and even by
pur&s;uing a regimen quite contrary to that which
he knew they pre&s;cribed to others, who &s;eemed
to be exactly in his condition. But he did not
find his account in this method, how &s;ucce&s;sful
loever it may have been in other ca&s;es. His
complaints, in&s;tead of vani&s;hing, were every day
more and more enraged; and at length he was
confined to his bed, where he lay bla&s;pheming
from morn to night, and from night to morn
though &s;till more determined than ever to adhere
to his former maxims.</P>
<P>In the mid&s;t of his torture, which was become
the common joke of the town, being circulated
through the indu&s;try of the phy&s;icians, who tri|umphed
in his di&s;a&s;ter; Peregrine, by means of
Mr. Pipes, employed a country-fellow, who had
come to market, to run with great ha&s;te, early
<PB N="296" REF="305">
one morning, to the lodgings of all the doctors
in town, and de&s;ire them to attend the colonel
with all imaginable di&s;patch. In con&s;equence of
this &s;ummons, the whole faculty put them&s;elves
in motion; and three of the foremo&s;t arriving at
the &s;ame in&s;tant of time, far from complimenting
one another with the door, each &s;eparately e&s;&s;ayed
to enter, and the whole triumvirate &s;tuck in the
pa&s;&s;age. While they remained thus wedged to|gether,
they de&s;cried two of their brethren po&s;t|ing
towards the &s;ame goal, with all the &s;peed that
God had enabled them to exert; upon which
they came to a parley, and agreed to &s;tand by one
another. This covenant being made, they di&s;|entangled
them&s;elves, and inquiring about the pa|tient,
were told by the &s;ervant, that he had ju&s;t
fallen a&s;leep.</P>
<P>Having received this intelligence, they took
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his anti-chamber, and &s;hut the
door, while the re&s;t of the tribe po&s;ted them|&s;elves
on the out&s;ide, as they arrived; &s;o that
the whole pa&s;&s;age was filled, from the top of the
&s;tair-ca&s;e to the &s;treet-door; and the people of
the hou&s;e, together with the colonel's &s;ervant,
&s;truck dumb with a&s;toni&s;hment. The three
leaders of this learned gang had no &s;ooner made
their lodgment good, than they began to con&s;ult
about the patient's malady, which every one of
them pretended to have con&s;idered with great
care and a&s;&s;iduity. The fir&s;t who gave his opi|nion,
&s;aid, the di&s;temper was an ob&s;tinate Ar|thritis;
the &s;econd affirmed, that it was no other
than a confirmed pox; and the third &s;wore it
was an inveterate &s;curvy. This diver&s;ity of opi|nions
was &s;upported by a variety of quotations
from medical authors, ancient as well as modern;
<PB N="297" REF="306">
but the&s;e were not of &s;ufficient authority, or at
lea&s;t not explicit enough to decide the di&s;pute;
for there are many &s;chi&s;ms in medicine, as well
as in religion, and each &s;ect can quote the fathers,
in &s;upport of the tenets they profe&s;s. In &s;hort,
the contention ro&s;e to &s;uch a pitch of clamour,
as not only alarmed their brethren on the &s;tair,
but al&s;o waked the patient from the fir&s;t nap he
had enjoyed in the &s;pace of ten whole days. Had
it been &s;imply waking, he would have been ob|liged
to them for the noi&s;e that di&s;turbed him;
for, in that ca&s;e, he would have been relieved
from the tortures of hell-fire, to which, in his
dream, he fancied him&s;elf expo&s;ed: but this
dreadful vi&s;ion had been the re&s;ult of that im|pre&s;&s;ion
which was made upon his brain, by the
intolerable angui&s;h of his joints; &s;o that, when
he waked, the pain, in&s;tead of being allayed,
was rather aggravated by a greater acutene&s;s of
&s;en&s;ation; and the confu&s;ed vociferation in the
next room, invading his ears at the &s;ame time,
he began to think his dream was realized; and,
in the pangs of de&s;pair, applied him&s;elf to a bell
that &s;tood by his bed-&s;ide, which he rung with
great violence and per&s;everance.</P>
<P>This alarm put an immediate &s;top to the di&s;|putation
of the three doctors, who, upon this
notice of his being awake, ru&s;hed into his cham|ber
without ceremony; and each &s;eizing an arm,
the third made the like application to one of his
temples. Before the patient could recollect him|&s;elf
from the amazement which had laid hold on
him, at this unexpected irruption, the room was
filled by the re&s;t of the faculty, who followed
the &s;ervant that entered, in obedience to his
ma&s;ter's call; and the bed was, in a moment, &s;ur|rounded
<PB N="298" REF="307">
by the&s;e gaunt mini&s;ters of death. The
colonel, &s;eeing him&s;elf be&s;et with &s;uch an a&s;&s;em|blage
of &s;olemn vi&s;ages and figures, which he
had always con&s;idered with the utmo&s;t dete&s;tation
and abhorrence, was incen&s;ed to a mo&s;t inex|pre&s;&s;ible
degree of indignation; and &s;o in&s;pirited
by his rage, that though his tongue denied its of|fice,
his other limbs performed their function;
he di&s;engaged him&s;elf from the triumvirate, who
had taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his body, &s;prung out of
bed with incredible agility, and &s;eizing one of his
crutches, applied it &s;o effectually to one of the
three, ju&s;t as he &s;tooped to examine the patient's
water, that his tye$periwig dropped into the pot,
while he him&s;elf fell motionle&s;s on the floor.</P>
<P>This &s;ignificant explanation di&s;concerted the
whole fraternity; every man turned his face, as
if it were by in&s;tinct, towards the door; and the
retreat of the community being ob&s;tructed by the
efforts of individuals, confu&s;ion and tumultuous
uproar en&s;ued: for the colonel, far from limiting
his prowe&s;s to the fir&s;t exploit, handled his wea|pon
with a&s;toni&s;hing vigour and dexterity, with|out
re&s;pect of per&s;ons; &s;o that few or none of
them had e&s;caped without marks of his di&s;plea|&s;ure,
when his &s;pirits failed, and he &s;unk down
again, quite exhau&s;ted, on his bed. Favoured
by this re&s;pite, the di&s;comfited faculty collected
their hats and wigs, which had fallen off in the
fray; and perceiving the a&s;&s;ailant too much en|feebled
to renew the attack, &s;et up their throats
together, and loudly threatened to pro&s;ecute him
&s;evere$y for &s;uch an outrageous a&s;&s;ault.</P>
<P>By this time, the landlord had interpo&s;ed;
and inquir$ng into the cau&s;e of the di&s;turbance,
was informed of what had happened by the com|plainants,
<PB N="299" REF="308">
who, at the &s;ame time, giving him to
under&s;tand, that they had been &s;everally &s;um|moned
to attend the colonel that morning, he
a&s;&s;ured them, that they had been impo&s;ed upon
by &s;ome wag; for his lodger had never dream'd
of con&s;ulting any one of their profe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Thunder&s;truck at this declaration, the general
clamour in&s;tantaneou&s;ly cea&s;ed; and each, in
particular, at once comprehending the nature of
the joke, they &s;neaked &s;ilently off with the lo&s;s
they had &s;u&s;tained, in unutterable &s;hame and mor|tification;
while Peregrine and his friend, who
took care to be pa&s;&s;ing that way by accident,
made a full &s;top at &s;ight of &s;uch an extraordinary
efflux, and enjoyed the countenance and condi|tion
of every one as he appeared: nay, even
made up to &s;ome of tho&s;e who &s;eemed mo&s;t af|fected
with their &s;ituation, and mi&s;chievou&s;ly tor|mented
them with que&s;tions touching this un|u&s;ual
congregation; then, in con&s;equence of the
information they received from the landlord and
the colonel's valet, &s;ubjected the &s;ufferers to the
ridicule of all the company in town. As it would
have been impo&s;&s;ible for the authors of this farce
to keep them&s;elves concealed from the indefati|gable
inquiries of the phy&s;icians, they made no
&s;ecret of their having directed the whole; though
they took care to own it in &s;uch an ambiguous
manner, as afforded no handle of pro&s;ecution.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. LXXVI.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">They di&s;tre&s;s the hou&s;ekeepers of Bath, by another
mi&s;chievous contrivance. Peregrine humbles a
noted hector, and meets with a &s;trange character
at the hou&s;e of a certain lady.</HEAD>
<P>THIS adventure was attended with another
&s;mall tour, that involved almo&s;t all the in|habitants
of Bath in a very ludicrous &s;cene of di|&s;tre&s;s.
Our hero, among his other remarks, had
ob&s;erved, that in this place there was no &s;uch
uten&s;il as a jack, and that all the &s;pits were turned
by dogs, which never failed to appear, at the
hour of employment, with &s;urpri&s;ing exactne&s;s
and regularity: &s;o that every family depended
with great confidence upon their known punctua|lity,
without taking the trouble to &s;ecure them
before-hand.</P>
<P>Our companions therefore, by means of their
under&s;trappers, who employed &s;everal chairmen
for the purpo&s;e, apprehended all the&s;e u&s;eful ani|mals,
on Saturday at night, and confined them
in an out-hou&s;e, with a view of perplexing the
people with regard to their Sunday's dinner. Nor
were they di&s;appointed in their expectations; the
$$$loins being &s;pitted at the u&s;ual time, the cook|maid
appeared at every door almo&s;t at the &s;ame
in&s;tant, and after having earne&s;tly ca&s;t their eyes
around, they began to run about the &s;treet, and
whi&s;tle with great vehemence, ejaculating cur&s;es
between whiles again&s;t the innocent curs, that
were d$&s;abled from obeying the dictates of their
duty. Frivolous as this circum&s;tance may &s;eem
to $word$ it was here con&s;idered as a family-concern
<PB N="301" REF="310">
of &s;ome con&s;equence; for the maids having com|municated
the affair to their re&s;pective mi&s;tre&s;&s;es,
every hou&s;e in a twinkling &s;ent forth its ma&s;ter
in a night-cap, &s;lippers, and morning-gown, in
order to find &s;ome remedy for this dreadful ca|lamity;
and a &s;econd concert of whi&s;tling was
performed in vain. They even a&s;&s;embled in
committees in the &s;treet, to deliberate on this
unheard-of defection of the dogs; and having
cudgelled their brains to no purpo&s;e, returned to
their &s;everal homes, in manife&s;t terror of lo&s;ing
a favourite meal.</P>
<P>Over and above this their di&s;traction, which
our young gentlemen in per&s;on enjoyed, they af|terwards
under&s;tood, that the affliction in many
hou&s;es was increa&s;ed, by the mi&s;carriage of the
&s;hifts to which they were reduced on this occa|&s;ion.
One ma&s;ter of a family, through the per|ver&s;ene&s;s
of his &s;ervants, was obliged to under|take
the office of turn&s;pit in <HI>propria per&s;ona,</HI>
to the de&s;truction of his appetite, and the danger
of his health; another being driven to the ne|ce&s;&s;ity
of cutting the roa&s;t into &s;teaks, fell &s;ick
of mortification, and had well nigh lo&s;t his wits;
and a third having contrived to &s;u&s;pend the &s;ur|loin
before the fire, in order to be twirled about
by the hand of an attendant, the pack-thread
gave way towards the end of the operation, and
the meat falling down, di&s;charged the contents
of the dripping-pan upon his leg, which was
&s;calded in a mi&s;erable manner: and what added
to their vexation, about one o'clock, when the
di&s;appointment was mo&s;t &s;everely felt, and the
misfortune irretrievable, Peregrine ordered the
pri&s;oners to be di&s;charged, and every kitchen was
vi&s;ited by one of the&s;e quadrupeds, as if they had
<PB N="302" REF="311">
come on purpo&s;e to in&s;ult the di&s;tre&s;s they had
occa&s;ioned. The&s;e, and a variety of other &s;tra|tagems,
practi&s;ed upon the objects of ridicule,
hatred and contempt, confirmed and augmented
the reputation of our adventurers, who had, by
this time, rendered them&s;elves terrible to all &s;orts
of delinquents of both &s;exes, from the brazen|fronted
game&s;ter and female libertine, to the
&s;tale maiden that deals in &s;candal and &s;trong wa|ters,
and the puny flutterer, who &s;eems to have
re&s;igned all preten&s;ions to manhood. Among
tho&s;e who never failed to re&s;ide at Bath, during
the &s;ea&s;on, was a certain per&s;on, who, from the
mo&s;t abject mi&s;ery, had by his indu&s;try and art
at play, ama&s;&s;ed about fifteen thou&s;and pounds;
and though his character was notorious, in&s;inuated
him&s;elf &s;o far into the favour of what is called
the be&s;t company, that very few private parties
of plea&s;ure took place, in which he was not
principally concerned. He was of a gigantic &s;ta|ture,
a mo&s;t intrepid countenance; and his di&s;|po&s;ition,
naturally over-bearing, had in the cour&s;e
of his adventures and &s;ucce&s;s, acquired a mo&s;t
intolerable degree of in&s;olence and vanity. By
the ferocity of his features, and audacity of his
behaviour, he had obtained a reputation for the
mo&s;t undaunted courage, which had been con|firmed
by divers adventures, in which he had
humbled the mo&s;t a&s;&s;uming heroes of his own
fraternity; &s;o that he now reigned chief Hector
of the place, with unque&s;tioned authority.</P>
<P>With this &s;on of fortune was Peregrine one
evening engaged at play, and &s;o &s;ucce&s;sful, that
he could not help informing his friend of his good
luck. Godfrey hearing the de&s;cription of the
lo&s;er, immediately recognized the per&s;on, whom
<PB N="303" REF="312">
he had known at Tunbridge; and a&s;&s;uring Pickle,
that he was a &s;harper of the fir&s;t water, cau|tioned
him again&s;t any future connexion with
&s;uch a dangerous companion, who (he affirmed)
had &s;uffered him to win a &s;mall &s;um, that he
might be encouraged to lo&s;e a much greater, upon
&s;ome other occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>Our young gentleman trea&s;ured up this ad|vice;
and though he did not &s;cruple to give the
game&s;ter an opportunity of retrieving his lo&s;s,
when he next day demanded his revenge, he
ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed to proceed, after he had re|funded
his winning. The other, who con&s;i|dered
him as a hot-headed unthinking youth, en|deavoured
to inflame his pride to a continuance
of the game, by treating his &s;kill with &s;corn and
contempt; and, among other &s;arca&s;tic expre&s;|&s;ions,
advi&s;ing him to go to &s;chool again, before
he pretended to engage with ma&s;ters of the art.
Our hero, incen&s;ed at his arrogance, replied with
great warmth, that he knew him&s;elf &s;ufficiently
qualified for playing with men of honour, who
deal upon the &s;quare, and hoped he &s;hould always
deem it infamous, either to learn or practi&s;e the
tricks of a profe&s;&s;ed game&s;ter. &startq;Blood and
thunder! meaning me, Sir? (cried this arti&s;t,
rai&s;ing his voice, and curling his vi&s;age into a
mo&s;t intimidating frown.) Zounds! I'll cut the
throat of any &s;coundrel who has the pre&s;umption
to &s;uppo&s;e, that I don't play as honourably as
e'er a nobleman in the kingdom: and I in&s;i&s;t up|on
an explanation from you, Sir; or, by hell
and brim&s;tone! I &s;hall expect other &s;ort of &s;ati&s;|faction.&endq;
Peregrine (who&s;e blood by this time
boiled within h$m) an&s;wered without he&s;itation;
&startq;Far from thinking your demand unrea&s;onable,
<PB N="304" REF="313">
I will immediately explain my&s;elf without re|&s;erve,
and tell you, that, upon unque&s;tionable
authority, I believe you to be an impudent ra&s;cal
and common cheat.&endq;</P>
<P>The Hector was &s;o amazed and confounded at
the freedom of this declaration, which he thought
no man on earth would venture to make in his
pre&s;ence, that for &s;ome minutes he could not re|collect
him&s;elf; but, at length, whi&s;pered a chal|lenge
in the ear of our hero, which was accord|ingly
accepted. When they arrived next morn|ing
upon the field, the game&s;ter, arming his
countenance with all its terrors, advanced with a
&s;word of a mon&s;trous length, and putting him|&s;elf
in a po&s;ture, called aloud in a mo&s;t terrific
voice, &startq;Draw, damn ye, draw; I will this
in&s;tant &s;end you to your fathers.&endq; The youth
was not &s;low in complying with his de&s;ire; his
weapon was un&s;heathed in a moment, and he
began the attack with &s;uch unexpected &s;pirit and
addre&s;s, that his adver&s;ary, having made &s;hift
with great difficulty to parry the fir&s;t pa&s;s, re|treated
a few paces, and demanded a parley, in
which he endeavoured to per&s;uade the young
man, that to lay a man of his character under
the nece&s;&s;ity of cha&s;ti&s;ing his in&s;olence, was the
mo&s;t ra&s;h and incon&s;iderate &s;tep that he could
po&s;&s;ibly have taken; but, that he had compa&s;&s;ion
upon his youth, and was willing to &s;pare him, if
he would &s;urrender his &s;word, and promi&s;e to a&s;k
pardon in public for the offence he had given.
Pickle was &s;o much exa&s;perated at this unparallelled
effrontery, that, without deigning to make the
lea&s;t reply, he &s;lung his own hat in the propo&s;er's
face, and renewed the charge with &s;uch un|daunted
agility, that the game&s;ter, finding him|&s;elf
<PB N="305" REF="314">
in manife&s;t hazard of his life, betook him|&s;elf
to his heels, and fled homewards with in|credible
&s;peed, being clo&s;ely pur&s;ued by Pere|grine,
who having &s;heathed his &s;word, pelted
him with &s;tones as he ran, and compelled him to
go, that &s;ame day, into bani&s;hment from Bath,
where he had domineered &s;o long.</P>
<P>By this atchievement, which was the &s;ubject of
a&s;toni&s;hment to all the company, who had looked
upon the fugitive as a per&s;on of heroic courage,
our adventurer's reputation was rendered formi|dable
in all its circum&s;tances; although he thereby
di&s;obliged a good many people of fa&s;hion, who
had contracted an intimacy of friend&s;hip with the
exile, and who re&s;ented his di&s;grace, as if it had
been the misfortune of a worthy man. The&s;e
generous patrons, however, bore a very &s;mall
proportion to tho&s;e who were plea&s;ed with the
event of the duel; becau&s;e, in the cour&s;e of their
re&s;idence at Bath, they had either been in&s;ulted
or defrauded by the challenger. Nor was this
in&s;tance of our hero's courage unacceptable to
the ladies, few of whom could now re&s;i&s;t the
united force of &s;uch accompli&s;hments. Indeed,
neither he nor his friend Godfrey would have
found much difficulty in picking up an agreeable
companion for life; but Gauntlet's heart was pre|engaged
to Sophy; and Pickle, exclu&s;ive of his
attachment to Emily, which was &s;tronger than he
him&s;elf imagined, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed &s;uch a &s;hare of am|bition,
as could not be &s;atisfied with the conque&s;t
of any female he beheld at Bath.</P>
<P>His vi&s;its were, therefore, promi&s;cuous, with|out
any other view than that of amu&s;ement; and
though his pride was flattered by the advances of
the fair whom he had captivated, he never har|boured
<PB N="306" REF="315">
one thought of proceeding beyond the li|mits
of common gallantry, and carefully avoided
all particular explanations. But, what above all
other enjoyments yielded him the mo&s;t agreeable
entertainment, was the &s;ecret hi&s;tory of cha|racters,
which he learn'd from a very extraordi|nary
per&s;on, with whom he became acquainted
in this manner.</P>
<P>Being at the hou&s;e of a certain lady, on a vi|&s;iting-day,
he was &s;truck with the appearance of
an old man, who no &s;ooner entered the room
than the mi&s;tre&s;s of the hou&s;e very kindly de|&s;ired
one of the wits pre&s;ent to roa&s;t the old put.
This petit maitre, proud of the employment,
went up to the &s;enior, who had &s;omething ex|tremely
peculiar and &s;ignificant in his counte|nance,
and &s;aluting him with divers fa&s;hionable
cong&eacute;s, acco&s;ted him in the&s;e words: &startq;Your
&s;ervant, you old ra&s;cal. I hope to have the ho|nour
of &s;eeing you hang'd. I vow to Gad! you
look extremely &s;hocking, with the&s;e gummy
eyes, lanthorn jaws, and toothle&s;s chaps. What!
you &s;quint at the ladies, you old rotten medlar?
Yes, yes, we under&s;tand your ogling; but you
mu&s;t content your&s;elf with a cook-maid, &s;ink
me! I &s;ee you want to &s;it. The&s;e wither'd
&s;hanks of yours tremble under their burthen:
but you mu&s;t have a little patience, old Hirco;
indeed you mu&s;t. I intend to mortify you a
little longer, cur&s;e me!&endq;</P>
<P>The company was &s;o tickled with this addre&s;s,
which was delivered with much grimace and
ge&s;ticulation, that they bur&s;t out into a loud fit
of laughter, which they fathered upon a mon|key
that was chained in the room; and when
the peal was over, the wit renewed his attack,
<PB N="307" REF="316">
in the&s;e words: &startq;I &s;uppo&s;e you are fool enough
to think this mirth was occa&s;ioned by Pug: ay,
there he is; you had be&s;t &s;urvey him; he is of
your own family, &s;witch me: but the laugh was
at your expence; and you ought to thank hea|ven
for making you &s;o ridiculous.&endq; While he
uttered the&s;e ingenious ejaculations, the old
gentleman bowed alternately to him and the
monkey, that &s;eemed to grin and chatter in imi|tation
of the beau, and with an arch &s;olemnity
of vi&s;age, pronounced, &startq;Gentlemen, as I have
not the honour to under&s;tand your compliments,
they will be much better be&s;towed on each other.&endq;
So &s;aying, he &s;eated him&s;elf, and had the &s;atis|faction
to &s;ee the laugh returned upon the ag|gre&s;&s;or,
who remained confounded and aba&s;hed,
and in a few minutes left the room, muttering,
as he retired, &startq;the old fellow grows &s;currilous,
&s;tap my breath.&endq;</P>
<P>While Peregrine wondered in &s;ilence at this
extraordinary &s;cene, the lady of the hou&s;e per|ceiving
his &s;urprize, gave him to under&s;tand,
that the ancient vi&s;itant was utterly bereft of the
&s;en&s;e of hearing; that his name was Cadwallader
Crabtree; his di&s;po&s;ition altogether mi&s;anthropi|cal;
and that he was admitted into company on
account of the entertainment he afforded by his
&s;arca&s;tic ob&s;ervations, and the plea&s;ant mi&s;takes
to which he was &s;ubject from his infirmity. Nor
did our hero wait a long time for an illu&s;tration
of this odd character. Every &s;entence he &s;poke
was replete with gall; nor did his &s;atire con&s;i&s;t
in general reflections, but in a &s;eries of remarks,
which had been made through the medium of a
mo&s;t whim&s;ical peculiarity of opinion.</P>
<P><PB N="308" REF="317">
Among tho&s;e who were pre&s;ent at this a&s;&s;embly
was a young officer, who having by dint of in|tere&s;t
obtained a &s;eat in the lower hou&s;e, thought
it incumbent upon him to talk of affairs of &s;tate;
and accordingly regaled the company with an ac|count
of a &s;ecret expedition which the French
were bu&s;ied in preparing; a&s;&s;uring them, that he
had it from the mouth of the mini&s;ter, to whom
it had been tran&s;mitted by one of his agents
abroad. In de&s;canting upon the particulars of
the armament, he ob&s;erved, that they had twenty
&s;hips of the line, ready manned and victualled at
Bre&s;t, which were de&s;tined for Toul$$, where
they would be joined by as many more; and
from thence proceed to the execution of their
&s;cheme, which he imparted as a &s;ecret not fit to
be divulged.</P>
<P>This piece of intelligence being communicated
to all the company, except Mr. Crabtree, who
&s;uffered by his lo&s;s of hearing, that cynic was
&s;oon after acco&s;ted by a lady, who, by means of
an artificial alphabet, formed by a certain con|junction
and di&s;po&s;ition of the &s;ingers, a&s;ked if
he had heard any extraordinary news of late?
Cadwallader, with his u&s;ual complai&s;ance, re|plied,
that he &s;uppo&s;ed &s;he took him for a courier
or &s;py, by teizing him eternally with that que|&s;tion.
He then expatiated upon the fooli&s;h cu|rio&s;ity
of mankind, which, he &s;aid, mu&s;$ either
proceed from idlene&s;s or want of ideas; and re|peated
almo&s;t verbatim the officer's information,
as a vague ridiculous report, invented by &s;ome
ignorant coxcomb, who wanted to give him&s;elf
airs of importance, and believed only by tho&s;e
who were utterly unacquainted with the politics
and &s;trength of the French nation.</P>
<P><PB N="309" REF="318">
In confirmation of what he had advanced, he
endeavoured to demon&s;trate how impo&s;&s;ible it
mu&s;t be for that people to fit out even the third
part of &s;uch a navy, &s;o &s;oon after the lo&s;&s;es they
had &s;u&s;tained during the war; and confirmed his
proof by a&s;&s;erting, that, to his certain know|ledge,
the harbours of Bre&s;t and Toulon could
not at that time produce a &s;quadron of eight &s;hips
of the line.</P>
<P>The member, who was an utter &s;tranger to
this mi&s;anthrope, hearing his own a&s;&s;everations
treated with &s;uch contempt, glowed with confu|&s;ion
and re&s;entment, and rai&s;ing his voice, began
to defend his own veracity with great eagerne&s;s
and trepidation, mingling with his arguments
many blu&s;tering invectives again&s;t the in&s;olence
and ill manners of his &s;uppo&s;ed contradictor, who
&s;at with the mo&s;t mortifying compo&s;ure of coun|tenance,
till the officer's patience was quite ex|hau&s;ted;
and then, to the manife&s;t increa&s;e of
his vexation, he was informed, that his antago|ni&s;t
was &s;o deaf, that, in all probability, the la&s;t
trumpet would make no impre&s;&s;ion upon him,

<P>PEregrine was extremely well plea&s;ed at this

words: &startq;Tho' the term of our communication
has been but &s;hort, you mu&s;t have perceived,

a&s;&s;i&s;tance, in pro&s;ecuting other &s;chemes of the

a &s;hort &s;ketch of my hi&s;tory, which will be pub|li&s;hed
after my death, in forty &s;even volumes of
my own compiling.</P>
<P>I was born about forty miles from this place,
of parents who having a very old family-name to
&s;upport, be&s;towed their whole fortune on my el|der
brother; &s;o that I inherited of my father
little el&s;e than a large &s;hare of choler, to which
I am indebted for a great many adventures that
did not always end to my &s;atisfaction. At the
age of eighteen I was &s;ent up to town, with a
recommendation to a certain peer, who found
means to amu&s;e me with the promi&s;e of a com|mi&s;&s;ion,
for &s;even whole years; and 'tis odds but
I &s;hould have made my fortune by my per&s;eve|rance,
had not I been arre&s;ted, and thrown into
the Ma$&s;hal&s;ea by my landlord, on who&s;e credit
<PB N="311" REF="320">
I had &s;ub&s;i&s;ted three years, after my father had
renounced me as an idle vagabond. There I re|mained
&s;ix months, among tho&s;e pri&s;oners who
have no other &s;upport than chance charity; and
contracted a very valuable acquaintance, which
was of great &s;ervice to me in the future emergen|cies
of my life.</P>
<P>I was no &s;ooner di&s;charged, in con&s;equence of
an act of parliament for the relief of in&s;olvent
debtors, than I went to the hou&s;e of my credi|tor,
whom I cudgelled without mercy; and that
I might leave nothing undone of tho&s;e things
which I ought to have done, my next &s;tage was
to We&s;tmin&s;ter-hall, where I waited until my
patron came forth from the hou&s;e, and &s;aluted
him with a blow that laid him &s;en&s;ele&s;s on the
pavement: but my retreat was not &s;o fortunate
as I could have wi&s;hed, the chairmen and lac|quies
in waiting having &s;urrounded and di&s;armed
me in a trice, I was committed to Newgate,
and loaded with chains; and a very &s;agacious
gentleman, who was afterwards hanged, having
&s;at in judgment upon my ca&s;e, pronounced me
guilty of a capital crime, and foretold my con|demnation
at the Old Baily. His progno&s;tic,
however, was di&s;appointed; for no body appear|ing
to pro&s;ecute me at the next &s;e&s;&s;ions, I was
di&s;charged, by order of the court. It would be
impo&s;&s;ible for me to recount, in the compa&s;s of
one day's conver&s;ation, all the particular exploits
in which I bore a con&s;iderable &s;hare: &s;uffice it to
&s;ay, I have been, at different times, pri&s;oner in
all the jails within the bills of mortality. I have
broke from every round-hou&s;e on this &s;ide
Temple-bar. No bailiff, in the days of my
youth and de&s;peration, dur&s;t execute a writ up|on
<PB N="312" REF="321">
me without a dozen followers; and the
ju&s;tices them&s;elves trembled when I was brought
before them.</P>
<P>I was once maimed by a carman, with whom
I quarrelled, becau&s;e he ridiculed my leek on St.
David's day; my &s;kull was fractured by a but|cher's
cleaver, on the like occa&s;ion. I have
been run thro' the body five times, and lo&s;t the
tip of my left ear by a pi&s;tol bullet. In a ren|counter
of this kind, having left my antagoni&s;t
for dead, I was wi&s;e enough to make my retreat
into France; and a few days after my arrival at
Paris entering into conver&s;ation with &s;ome offi|cers
on the &s;ubject of politics, a di&s;pute aro&s;e, in
which I lo&s;t my temper, and &s;poke &s;o irreverent|ly
of the <HI>Grand Monarque,</HI> that next morning I
was &s;ent to the ba&s;tile, by virtue of a <HI>Lettre de
Cachet.</HI> There I remained for &s;ome months, de|prived
of all intercour&s;e with rational creatures;
a circum&s;tance for which I was not &s;orry, as I
had the more time to project &s;chemes of revenge
again&s;t the tyrant who confined me, and the
wretch who had betrayed my private conver&s;a|tion:
but tired, at length, with the&s;e fruitle&s;s
&s;ugge&s;tions, I was fain to unbend the &s;everity of
my thoughts by a corre&s;pondence with &s;ome in|du&s;trious
&s;piders, who had hung my dungeon
with their ingenious labours.</P>
<P>I con&s;idered their work with &s;uch attention,
that I &s;oon became an adept in the my&s;tery of
weaving, and furni&s;hed my&s;elf with as many u&s;e|ful
ob&s;ervations and reflections on that art, as
will compo&s;e a very curious treati&s;e, which I in|tend
to bequeath to the Royal Society, for the
benefit of our woolen manufacture; and this
with a view to perpetuate my own name, rather
<PB N="313" REF="322">
than befriend my country: for, thank heaven!
I am weaned from all attachments of that kind,
and look upon my&s;elf as one very little obliged to
any &s;ociety what&s;oever. Although I pre&s;ided with
ab&s;olute power over this long-legg'd community,
and di&s;tributed rewards and puni&s;hments to each,
according to his de&s;erts, I grew impatient of
my &s;ituation; and my natural di&s;po&s;ition, one
day, prevailing, like a fire which had long been
&s;mothered, I wreaked the fury of my indignation
upon my innocent &s;ubjects, and in a twinkling
de&s;troyed the whole race. While I was employed
in this general ma&s;&s;acre, the turnkey, who
brought me food, opening the door, and per|ceiving
my tran&s;port, &s;hrugged up his &s;houlders,
and leaving my allowance, went out, pronouncing,
<HI>Le pauvre diable! la tele lui tourne.</HI> My pa&s;&s;ion
no &s;ooner &s;ub&s;ided than I re&s;olved to profit by
this opinion of the jailor, and from that day coun|terfeited
lunacy with &s;uch &s;ucce&s;s, that in le&s;s
$word$ three months I was delivered from the
ba&s;tile, and &s;ent to the gallies, in which they
thought my bodily vigour might be of &s;ervice,
although the faculties of my mind were decayed.
Before I was chained to the oar, I received three
hundred &s;tripes by way of welcome, that I might
thereby be rendered more tractable, notwith|&s;tanding
I u&s;ed all the arguments in my power to
per&s;uade them, I was only <HI>mad north, north we&s;t,
and when the wind was &s;outherly, knew a hawk
from an hand-&s;aw.</HI></P>
<P>In our &s;econd cruize we had the good fortune
to be overtaken by a tempe&s;t, during which the
$aves were unbound, that they might contribute
the more to the pre&s;ervation of the galley, and
<PB N="314" REF="323">
have a chance for their lives, in ca&s;e of a &s;hip|wreck.
We were no &s;ooner at liberty, than
making our&s;elves ma&s;ters of the ve&s;&s;el, we robbed
the officers, and ran her on &s;hore among rocks
on the coa&s;t of Portugal; from whence I ha&s;ten|ed
to Lisbon, with a view of obtaining my pa&s;|&s;age
in &s;ome &s;hip bound for England, where, by
this time, I hoped my affair would be for|gotten.</P>
<P>But before this &s;cheme could be accompli&s;hed,
my evil genius led me into company; and being
intoxicated, I began to broach doctrines on the
&s;ubject of religion, at which &s;ome of the partie
were &s;candalized and incen&s;ed; and I was next
day dragged out of bed by the officers of the in|qui&s;ition,
and conveyed to a cell in the pri&s;on
belonging to that tribunal.</P>
<P>At my fir&s;t examination my re&s;entment was
&s;trong enough to &s;upport me under the torture,
which I endured without flinching; but my re|&s;olution
abated, and my zeal immediately cool|ed,
when I under&s;tood from a fellow-pri&s;oner,
who groaned on the other &s;ide of the partition,
that in a &s;hort time there would be an <HI>Auto de
Fe;</HI> in con&s;equence of which I would, in all
probability, be doomed to the flames, if I would
not renounce my heretical errors, and &s;ubmit to
&s;uch penance as the church &s;hould think fit to
pre&s;cribe. This mi&s;erable wretch was convicted
of Judai&s;m, which he had privately practi&s;ed, by
connivance, for many years, until he had ama&s;&s;ed
a fortune &s;ufficient to attract the regard of the
church. To this he fell a &s;acrifice, and accordingly
prepared him&s;elf for the &s;take; while I, not at all
ambitious of the crown of martyrdom, re&s;olved
<PB N="315" REF="324">
to temporize: &s;o that, when I was brought to
the que&s;tion the &s;econd time, I made a &s;olemn
recantation; and, as I had no worldly fortune to
ob&s;truct my &s;alvation, was received into the bo|&s;om
of the church, and, by way of penance, en|joined
to walk barefoot to Rome, in the habit of
a pilgrim.</P>
<P>During my peregrination thro Spain, I was
detained as a &s;py, until I could procure creden|tials
from the inqui&s;ition at Lisbon; and behaved
with &s;uch re&s;olution and re&s;erve, that, after be|ing
relea&s;ed, I was deemed a proper per&s;on to be
employed in quality of a &s;ecret intelligencer, at
a certain court. This office I undertook, with|out
he&s;itation; and being furni&s;hed with money
and bills of credit, cro&s;&s;ed the Pyrenees, with
intention to revenge my&s;elf upon the Spaniard
for the &s;everities I had undergone, during my
captivity.</P>
<P>Having therefore effectually di&s;gui&s;ed my&s;elf,
by a change of dre&s;s, and a large patch on one
eye, I hired an equipage, and appeared at Bo|logna,
in quality of an itinerant phy&s;ician; in
which capacity I &s;ucceeded tolerably well, till
my &s;ervants decamped in the night, with my
baggage, and left me in the condition of Adam.
In &s;hort, I have travelled over the greate&s;t part
of Europe, as a beggar, pilgrim, prie&s;t, &s;oldier,
game&s;ter, and quack; and felt the extremes of
indigence and opulence, with the inclemency of
weather, in all its vici&s;&s;itudes. I have learned
that the characters of mankind are every where
the &s;ame; that common &s;en&s;e and hone&s;ty bear
an infinitely &s;mall proportion to folly and vice;
and that life is at be&s;t a paulty province.</P>
<P><PB N="316" REF="325">
After having &s;uffered innumerable hard&s;hips,
dangers, and di&s;graces, I returned to London,
where I lived &s;ome years in a garret, and picked
up a &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, &s;uch as it was, by vending purges
in the &s;treets, from the back of a pied hor&s;e; in
which &s;ituation I u&s;ed to harrangue the mob, in
broken Engli&s;h, under pretence of being an High
German doctor.</P>
<P>At la&s;t an uncle died, by whom I inherit an
e&s;tate of three hundred pounds per annum, tho',
in his life-time, he would not have parted with a
&s;ix-pence, to &s;ave my &s;oul and body from perdi|tion.</P>
<P>I now appear in the world, not as a member
of any community, or what is called a &s;ocial crea|ture;
but meerly as a &s;pectator, who entertains
him&s;elf with the grimaces of a jack-pudding, and
banquets his &s;pleen in beholding his enemies at
l$ggerheads. That I may enjoy this di&s;po&s;ition,
ab&s;tracted from all interruption, danger, and par|ticipation,
I &s;eign my&s;elf deaf; an expedient by
which I not only avoid all di&s;putes, and their

<HEAD>CHAP. LXXVIII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">A treaty is concluded betwixt Cadwallader and our
hero; in con&s;equence of which divers plea&s;ant ad|ventures
occur, until the young gentleman is &s;um|moned
to the gari&s;on on a very intere&s;ting oc|ca&s;ion.</HEAD>
<P>HEre the Mi&s;anthrope left off &s;peaking, de|&s;irous
to know the &s;entiments of our he|ro,
who embraced the proffered alliance, in a
tran&s;port of joy and &s;urprize; and the treaty was
no &s;ooner concluded than Mr. Crabtree began to
perform articles, by imparting to him a thou&s;and
delicious &s;ecrets, from the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of which he
promi&s;ed him&s;elf innumerable &s;cenes of mirth and
enjoyment. By means of this a&s;&s;ociate, whom
he con&s;idered as the ring of Gyges, he fore&s;aw
that he &s;hould be enabled to penetrate not only
into the chambers but even to the inmo&s;t thoughts
<PB N="318" REF="327">
of the female &s;ex; and, in order to ward off &s;u&s;pi|cion,
they agreed to revile each other in public,
and meet at a certain private rendezvous, to
communicate their mutual di&s;coveries, and con|cert
their future operations. So precious did Pe|regrine
e&s;teem this trea&s;ure, that he would not
even make his friend Godfrey acquainted with
his good fortune, tho' the fir&s;t u&s;e he made of it,
was in behalf of that young gentleman, whom
he undeceived in two very intere&s;ting particulars.</P>
<P>The &s;oldier's addre&s;&s;es were, at that time,
&s;hared betwixt two ladies, who received them
in a very different manner. By one of them he
was care&s;s'd with marks of particular regard, and
by &s;mall favours flattered with the expectation of
&s;upreme &s;ucce&s;s; while the other treated him
with &s;uch &s;everity and &s;hyne&s;s, that he could
never find an opportunity or re&s;olution to make
an unre&s;tricted declaration of his flame. As every
woman has a confidant, to whom &s;he pours forth
her heart on the&s;e occa&s;ions, Mr. Crabtree hap|pened
to be pre&s;ent when each of them di&s;bur|thened
her&s;elf of her &s;entiments with regard to
her lover; and learned from their own confe&s;|&s;ions,
that the frank lady cajoled him for the
&s;ake of the money which he &s;uffered him&s;elf to
lo&s;e at cards, though &s;he had not the lea&s;t in|tention
to extend her complai&s;ance beyond the
limits of exterior civilities; while the prude was
actually enamoured of his per&s;on, and through a
remnant of mode&s;ty avoided him for no other
rea&s;on, but becau&s;e &s;he knew her&s;elf incapable
of re&s;i&s;ting his &s;ollicitations.</P>
<P>Mr. Gauntlet profited by this di&s;covery, which
was communicated to him through the canal of
<PB N="319" REF="328">
his friend, relinqui&s;hed the mercenary coquet,
and found means to vanqui&s;h the re&s;erve of the
other. Peregrine him&s;elf was, in like manner,
&s;et to rights, in certain opinions he had conceived
of his own influence with particular ladies; and
as no per&s;on ever offended him with impunity,
he projected a &s;cheme of vengeance again&s;t a re|markable
inamorato, who to his a&s;&s;iduities pre|ferred
tho&s;e of a brawny fellow, that, from the
place of a private trooper in the hor&s;e-guards, had
been preferred to the rank of a lieutenant, by
the intere&s;t of a dowager lately decea&s;ed. With
this favourite did the lady make an a&s;&s;ignation,
in the hearing of Cadwallader, who gave our
hero to under&s;tand, that he was to be received
by her woman, in the dark, at a parlour-door
that opened into a &s;mall garden, the wall of
which he could ea&s;ily overleap, after the &s;ervants
&s;hould be retired to re&s;t.</P>
<P>Peregrine, fraught with this intelligence, re|&s;olved
to anticipate his rival; and accordingly,
by the mini&s;tration of his companion, engaged a
couple of &s;tout chairmen, who being po&s;ted on
the &s;pot, &s;eized the lover in his endeavours to
furmount the wall, and conveyed him to a place
of confinement, on pretence of &s;uppo&s;ing his de|&s;ign
was to rob the hou&s;e. He was no &s;ooner
&s;ecured in this manner, than Pickle, being de|termined
to pro&s;ecute the adventure, tran&s;ported
him&s;elf into the garden, and per&s;onating the lieu|tenant,
went to the door, made the &s;ignal
which had been agreed upon, was admitted by
the attendant, conducted to her lady's apartment,
that was darkened for her reception; and having
enjoyed his revenge, with every circum&s;tance of
<PB N="320" REF="329">
&s;atisfaction, made his retreat before day, with|out
being di&s;covered, after having been gratified
with a valuable ring, as a te&s;timony of her lady|&s;hip's affection.</P>
<P>Mean while the di&s;appointed captive finding
him&s;elf involved in a trouble&s;ome affair, that mu&s;t
end either in his own di&s;grace, or in that of his
mi&s;tre&s;s, whom he could not with honour expo&s;e,
employed all his art in tampering with his de|tainers,
who pretended to have detected him as
they pa&s;&s;ed that way by accident, and who would
not li&s;ten to the terms he propo&s;ed for his relea&s;e
until it was almo&s;t day; and then, by the per|mi&s;&s;ion
of their employers, they &s;et him at liber|ty,
in con&s;ideration of five guineas, which he di|vided
between them. From the time of his di&s;|charge
he waited with the utmo&s;t impatience for
the hour of breakfa&s;t, and when it approached
hied him to the hou&s;e of his Dulcinea, with a
view of excu&s;ing him&s;elf for the breach of punc|tuality
he was obliged to commit.</P>
<P>He was confounded at the air of &s;atisfaction and
complacency that manife&s;ted it&s;elf in the lady's
appearance; but believing it was no other than
affectation, to conceal her inward di&s;quiet and
chagrin, he a&s;&s;umed a mo&s;t dejected look, and
with many expre&s;&s;ions of mortification recounted
the cur&s;ed accident which had di&s;abled him from
reaping the delicious fruits of his expectation.
The nymph, who was not all &s;ubject to the vul|gar
&s;ymptoms of confu&s;ion, hearing this circum|&s;tantial
detail, fixed her eyes upon the &s;oldier's
countenance, and regarding him attentively for
&s;ome minutes; &startq;If this declaration (&s;aid &s;he) be
an effort of your delicacy, you may &s;pare &s;uch
<PB N="321" REF="330">
ridiculous re&s;erve for the future. When things
are come to a certain pa&s;s, &s;uch ceremony is &s;u|perfluous
and di&s;agreeable. But perhaps you re|member
your good fortune with regret, and ac|tually
wi&s;h you had met with that adventure you
have been at &s;uch pains to feign, rather than
have enjoyed &s;o cheap a conque&s;t. Indeed you
was &s;o impatient to be gone before morning, that
you &s;eemed rather tired of your &s;tay, than &s;ollicit|ous
about my reputation.&endq;</P>
<P>The trooper, amazed and alarmed at this un|expected
addre&s;s, &s;wore with many vulgar exe|crations,
that he could prove he was in cu&s;tody
from twelve till &s;ix o'clock in the morning; and
that he began to perceive he had been finely flung
by &s;ome ra&s;cal, who had vi&s;ited her in his place.
He even hinted a &s;u&s;picion, that the whole affair
had been tran&s;acted by her connivance; and be|came
extremely rough and unmannerly in his ex|po&s;tulations:
&s;o that the lady, who had more of
the tygre&s;s than of the lamb in her di&s;po&s;ition,
being exa&s;perated at the freedom of his behaviour,
ordered him down &s;tairs, and (to u&s;e the com|mon
phra&s;e) forbad him her hou&s;e. He accord|ingly
retired, not without many invectives and
threats, which he bawled aloud in his march;
while his incen&s;ed patrone&s;s, by this time &s;en&s;ible
that &s;he had been the dupe of &s;ome &s;tratagem, re|mained
in a &s;tate of un&s;peakable anxiety and
mortification. Being ble&s;&s;ed, however, with a
great &s;hare of penetration, &s;he forthwith &s;et it at
work; and, after &s;ome recollection, concluded
that the &s;ub&s;titute could be no other than Pere|grine,
who had either learned the circum&s;tance
of the a&s;&s;ignation from her maid, or extracted
<PB N="322" REF="331">
them from the vanity and indi&s;cretion of the gal|lant
him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Now that &s;he had an opportunity of being ac|quainted
with all our young gentleman's qualifi|cations,
&s;he did not repine at the <HI>qui pro quo</HI>
which had been played upon her, and re&s;olved to
transfer her good graces to Peregrine, without
re&s;erve. With this view &s;he favoured him
with the mo&s;t palpable advances and allu&s;ions,
which he would not under&s;tand, but on the
contrary, conveyed the ring to her in a letter,
written in a counterfeited character, with a feign|ed
name, importing, that as he had rea&s;on to be|lieve
the token was intended for another, he could
not in con&s;cience re&s;erve it for his own u&s;e: and
to crown her vexation, by his contrivance, every
circum&s;tance of the &s;tory was divulged, except
the name of the per&s;on who had repre&s;ented the
lover.</P>
<P>While our adventurer thus enjoyed his di&s;po|&s;ition,
he was &s;ummoned to the ca&s;tle by an ex|pre&s;s
from his friend Hatchway, repre&s;enting that
the commodore lay at the point of death; and in
le&s;s than an hour after the receipt of this melan|choly
piece of news, he &s;et out po&s;t for his uncle's
habitation, having previou&s;ly taken leave of his
a&s;&s;ociate Crabtree, who promi&s;ed to meet him in
two months at London, and &s;ettled a corre&s;pon|dence
with Gauntlet, who propo&s;ed to remain at
Bath during the remaining part of the &s;ea&s;on.</P>
