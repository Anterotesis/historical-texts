<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>IN the year 1711, Mr. <HI>Charles John&s;on</HI> alter'd the
<HI>Game&s;ter,</HI> written originally by <HI>Shirley,</HI> into a Co|medy,
which he call'd the <HI>Wife</HI>'s <HI>Relief,</HI> or <HI>the Husband</HI>'s
<HI>Cure:</HI> In this play he retain'd <HI>Shirley</HI>'s under-plot of
<HI>Leonora, Violante</HI> and <HI>Beaumont;</HI> which has no nece&s;&s;ary
dependance upon the principal action, and had therefore
been generally cen&s;ur'd as impertinent; nor has it, &s;epa|rately
con&s;ider'd, any excellence to attone for that defect.
The editor of the <HI>Game&s;ters,</HI> as it is now a &s;econd time
alter'd from <HI>Shirley,</HI> will not pre&s;ume to offer any ob|jections
to the alterations and additions which Mr. <HI>John|&s;on</HI>
has been pleas'd to make&mdash;It will be &s;ufficient for
him to inform the reader, that he has nothing in common
with <HI>John&s;on,</HI> but what both he and <HI>John&s;on</HI> have in
common with <HI>Shirley.</HI> The characters of <HI>Barnacle</HI> and
the <HI>Nephew,</HI> which were before unconnected with the
principal action, are now interwoven with it: what alte|rations
and additions have been now made, will be better
known by a compari&s;on of this play with the<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">It is printed in the 8th volume of the collection of old plays, pub|li&s;hed

the public.</P>
