<HEAD>MINUTES <HI>of the Advocates at</HI> Edinburgh.</HEAD>
<HEAD><HI>July</HI> 30.</HEAD>
<P>MR. <HI>Robert Bennet,</HI> Dean of the Fa|culty, pre&s;ented a Medal from the Dutche&s;s of <HI>Gordon,</HI> and made the following Speech, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P><Q>&startq;Her Grace &s;ends, as a Pre&s;ent to you, the Medal of King <HI>James</HI> VIII. whom we and the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> call the Pretender. I hope&endq; Thanks are to be return'd for it.</Q></P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Alex. Steven&s;on</HI> an&s;wer'd, <HI>That the Me|dal &s;hou'd be return'd to her Grace; for the re|ceiving it was throwing Dirt upon the Face of the Government.</HI></P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Robert Alexander</HI> of <HI>Black Hou&s;e</HI> &s;econd|ed him, and &s;aid, <HI>That the receiving &s;uch a Medal was owning a Right contrary to her Ma|je&s;ty's.</HI></P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Robert Frazer</HI> an&s;wer'd, <HI>That</HI> Oliver Cromwell's <HI>Medal, who de&s;erv'd to be hang'd, and the Arms of the Common-wealth of</HI> Eng|land, <HI>had been receiv'd, and why not this?</HI></P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="3">
Mr. <HI>Duncan Forbes,</HI> Brother to <HI>Colloden,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Jo&s;eph Hume of Nineboles,</HI> &s;aid, <HI>It was time enough then to receive the Medal when the Pretender was hang'd.</HI> To whom adher'd Mr. <HI>Hugh Dalrymple,</HI> Son to the Pre&s;ident, Mr. <HI>James Fergu&s;on,</HI> Son to Sir <HI>John Fergu&s;on of Kirkennel,</HI> and Sir <HI>James Stuart of Goodtrees,</HI> her Maje&s;ty's Sollicitor.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Dunda&s;s</HI> of <HI>Arni&s;ton</HI> after that ro&s;e up, and made the following Speech.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dean of Faculty,</SPEAKER>
<P><Q>&startq;Whatever the&s;e Gentlemen may &s;ay of their Loyalty, I think they affront the Queen whom they pretend to honour, in di&s;gracing her Brother, who is not only a Prince of the Blood, but the fir&s;t thereof; and if Blood can give any Right, he is our undoubted Sovereign. I think too, they bring her Maje&s;ty's Title in que&s;tion, which is not our Bu&s;ine&s;s to determine. Medals are the Documents of Hi&s;tory, to which all Hi&s;torians refer: and therefore tho I &s;hould give King <HI>William</HI>'s Stamp with the Devil at his right Ear, I &s;ee not how it cou'd be refus'd, &s;eeing a hundred years hence it wou'd prove that &s;uch a Coin had been in <HI>England.</HI> But, <HI>Dean of Faculty,</HI> what needs further Speeches? None oppo&s;e re|ceiving the Medal, and returning Thanks to her Grace, but a few pitiful &s;coundrel Vermin and Mu&s;hrooms, not worthy our notice. Let us therefore proceed to name &s;ome of our Number, to return our hearty Thanks to the Dutche&s;s of <HI>Gordon.&endq;</HI></Q></P>
</SP>
<P><PB N="5" REF="4">
The Dean of the Faculty put it to the Vote, and carry'd it, That Thanks &s;hou'd be return'd to her Grace by the &s;aid Mr. <HI>Dun|da&s;s</HI> and Mr. <HI>Horn of We&s;thall.</HI></P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Dunda&s;s</HI> ask'd, In what Terms he &s;hou'd return Thanks?</P>
<P>The Dean of the Faculty, in the name of the whole Society, an&s;wer'd, <HI>That they wou'd approve what&s;oever Mr.</HI> Dunda&s;s <HI>and Mr.</HI> Horn <HI>thought convenient.</HI></P>
<P>According to the Order given, Mr. <HI>Dun|da&s;s</HI> and Mr. <HI>Horn</HI> waited upon her Grace on <HI>Tue&s;day</HI> the third In&s;tant <HI>July,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Dun|da&s;s</HI> &s;poke to her Grace as followeth, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Madam,</SPEAKER>
<P><Q>&startq;We are deputed here by the Dean and Faculty of Advocates, in their Name, and for our &s;elves, to return our mo&s;t hearty Thanks to your Grace for all your Fa|vours, and particularly for the Honour you did us in pre&s;enting us with a Medal of our Sovereign Lord the King. We &s;hall always be proud of any Occa&s;ion to te&s;tify our Loyalty to his Maje&s;ty, and the Re&s;pect and Honour we have for your Grace.&endq;</Q></P>
</SP>
<P>The Dutche&s;s an&s;wer'd:</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gentlemen,</SPEAKER>
<P><Q>&startq;I have always e&s;teem'd the Faculty of Advocates as the mo&s;t Learned and Gen|tlemanny Society in <HI>Europe:</HI> And &s;eeing they have made &s;o fine a Collection of Books and Medals, I think every body
<PB N="6" REF="5">
&s;hou'd a&s;&s;i&s;t them. For my part, what|ever of Value comes to my hand, of either &s;ort, I &s;hall freely be&s;tow 'em upon&endq; the Faculty.</Q></P>
</SP>
<P>Mr. <HI>Dunda&s;s</HI> reply'd:</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Madam,</SPEAKER>
<P><Q>&startq;I hope, and am confident &s;o do my Con|&s;tituents, that your Grace &s;hall have very &s;oon an Opportunity to compliment the Faculty with a &s;econd Medal &s;truck upon the Re&s;toration of the King and Royal Fa|mily, and the fini&s;hing Rebellion, u&s;urping Tyranny and Whiggery.&endq;</Q></P>
</SP>
<P><HI>N. B.</HI> The Medal was <HI>Britain</HI> and <HI>Ireland</HI> with a Fleet of Ships coming to 'em, and the <HI>Motto Reddite</HI> on the one &s;ide; and on the other &s;ide the King's Face, with this In&s;crip|tion, <HI>Cujus e&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>75 were pre&s;ent, only 12 refus'd it.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1>
<PB N="7" REF="6">
<HEAD>REMARKS.</HEAD>
<P>THis Medal is not new, for we have had an Account of it above a year ago; or rare, for 'tis common enough: nor does the intrin&s;ick Value of it exceed half a Crown, &s;o that it cou'd not be worth the Dutche&s;s's while to pre&s;ent it, or the Faculty's to re|ceive it on the account of its being new, &s;carce or valuable in it &s;elf.</P>
<P>Had the Advocates de&s;ign'd it only as a Curio&s;ity fit to have a place among their Col|lection of Medals, they might as ea&s;ily have got it as one of Mr. <HI>Dunda&s;s</HI>'s Copper Half-Pence that was &s;tamp'd by a notorious Vil|lain with the Devil at King <HI>William</HI>'s right Ear; and they might have put it in their Collection without any Noi&s;e, to have &s;erv'd as a proof a hundred years hence that &s;uch a trea&s;onable Medal had been &s;truck, a&s;&s;erting the Pretender's Right.</P>
<P>But the pre&s;enting and rece$$ing it with &s;o much Parade, and endeavouring to make it the Act of the Faculty, is a publick and trea&s;onable affront to her Maje&s;ty, an arraign|ment of her Title, and a &s;triking at the <HI>Hanover</HI> Succe&s;&s;ion: all which is direct Trea|&s;on by the Laws of <HI>Great-Britain.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="7">
This Crime, which is as high as any that is cognizable by our Law, except it be Bla&s;|phemy again&s;t God, is further aggravated by its Circum&s;tances.</P>
<P N="1">I. In that 'twas pre&s;ented by a Lady of the highe&s;t Rank, and of one of the greate&s;t Families in the Kingdom. This &s;eems to have been done on purpo&s;e to give it the more weight for encouraging the Jacobite Faction, that a Lady of &s;uch high Birth in <HI>England,</HI> and marry'd to one of the chief and mo&s;t potent Families in <HI>Scotland,</HI> &s;hou'd dare in &s;o publick a manner to e&s;pou&s;e the Cau&s;e and Title of the Pretender. But one wou'd have thought her Grace might have con&s;ider'd how much her own Family had &s;uffer'd by adhering to the Cau&s;e of the abdicated Fa|ther, which is not like to be retriev'd by her intemperate Zeal for the pretended Son. Or had &s;he con&s;ulted the Hi&s;tory of the Duke her Husband's Family, &s;he might &s;oon have been convinc'd, that they have lo&s;t much of their antient Power and Grandeur, by adhering to the Cau&s;e of Popery and Ar|bitrary Power &s;ince the beginning of the Reformation in <HI>Scotland,</HI> be&s;ides the Lives they have lo&s;t in the Field and otherwi&s;e on that occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>The Duke &s;eem'd to be &s;en&s;ible of this, and therefore behav'd him&s;elf with &s;uch Mo|deration when he held out the Ca&s;tle of <HI>E|dinburgh</HI> for King <HI>James</HI> at the Revolution, as ju&s;tly procur'd him the E&s;teem of his Country, in which he has &s;o great an Intere&s;t, and obtain'd him honourable Articles of
<PB N="9" REF="8">
Capitulation when he &s;urrender'd. His peaceable Behaviour ever &s;ince &s;eems to vindicate his Grace from having any hand in this weak Conduct of the Dutche&s;s, who has neither con&s;ulted the Duke's In|tere&s;t, nor that of the Marqui&s;s her Son, who&s;e matching with a Prote&s;tant Lady, and his other Conduct, is a proof of &s;uch Mode|ration as becomes a young Lord of his Qua|lity and Expectations.</P>
<P>It is true, the Religion of the Dutche&s;s may plead &s;omething towards excu&s;ing her; but &s;ince her very Principles make her lia|ble to the Law, &s;uch an Action as this is far from being proper to ward off its Pe|nalties.</P>
<P>I come next to the Advocates, and mu&s;t ob&s;erve, that their very Profe&s;&s;ion heigh|tens their Crime; and their being declar'd Prote&s;tants is far from le&s;&s;ening it, &s;ince the Step they have taken tends manife&s;tly to overturn both Law and Religion, the pre&s;ervation of which is the end of their Office.</P>
<P>But it wou'd &s;eem, the De&s;ign of the Faction was to give Reputation to their Cau&s;e, by bringing in &s;o many Gentlemen of the long Robe to e&s;pou&s;e it. This they knew to be the readie&s;t way to deceive the Vulgar, and to bring them into their Mea&s;ures, &s;ince they are generally led by great Examples, and will be apt to con|clude, that there can be no Danger in follow|ing the Pattern &s;et them by tho&s;e who ought be&s;t of all Men to under&s;tand the Laws and Con&s;titutions of their Country.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="9">
The timing of this Tran&s;action is al&s;o very remarkable on the following Ac|counts.</P>
<P N="1">1. That it was &s;o &s;oon after the General A&s;&s;embly of the Church of <HI>Scotland</HI> had publickly declar'd them&s;elves for the Pro|te&s;tant Succe&s;&s;ion in the Hou&s;e of <HI>Han|over:</HI> And their Sen&s;e being ju&s;tly taken for that of the Bulk of the Prote&s;tants in the Nation, whom they fully repre&s;ent in an Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Capacity, it wou'd &s;eem the Faction thought it nece&s;&s;ary to bal|lance them, by what they wou'd pa&s;s upon the World as the Sen&s;e of tho&s;e who are the Mini&s;ters of Law and Ju&s;tice in that Country.</P>
<P N="2">2. That it was likewi&s;e &s;o &s;oon after her Maje&s;ty had declar'd by her Speech, at the clo&s;e of la&s;t Se&s;&s;ion of Parliament, That &s;he wou'd maintain the <HI>Hanover</HI> Succe&s;&s;ion. From whence we have rea&s;on to conclude, that the Faction being &s;en&s;ible of the Hurt which this had done their Cau&s;e, they thought the only way to retrieve it, was by getting &s;o many Lawyers to declare for it. That was nece&s;&s;ary to revive the droop|ing Spirits of the Party, who were baulk'd in the mighty Expectations they flatter'd them&s;elves with, when they exerted their utmo&s;t Efforts to &s;end up Per&s;ons of their own Stamp to repre&s;ent <HI>Scotland</HI> in Par|liament. This looks &s;o like the Practice of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Highfliers, to retrieve the Lo&s;s which their Cau&s;e &s;u&s;tain'd by the Sentence of Parliament again&s;t <HI>Sacheverel</HI>'s Doctrine, that we have rea&s;on to conclude
<PB N="11" REF="10">
it proceeds from the &s;ame Source; that the Party, in both Nations, is acted by one and the &s;ame Spirit, and have the &s;ame per|nicious Views.</P>
<P N="3">3. That it was at a time when our Ar|mies are in the Field, venturing their Lives for the common Liberties of <HI>Europe,</HI> and particularly for the &s;upport of her Maje&s;ty's Title and the Prote&s;tant Succe&s;&s;ion; which gives us rea&s;on to conjecture, that it was de&s;ign'd on purpo&s;e to encourage a &s;econd Inva&s;ion by the Pretender, when the Na|tion is exhau&s;ted of &s;o great a part of its Force by foreign Expeditions. If this Re|flection be thought too uncharitable, the Advocates may blame their Orator <HI>Dun|da&s;s</HI> for it, &s;ince he &s;o boldly tells the Dutche&s;s of <HI>Gordon,</HI> <Q>&startq;That he and his Con&s;tituents did hope her Grace wou'd very &s;oon have an Opportunity to com|pliment the Faculty with a &s;econd Medal upon the Re&s;toration of the King and the Royal Family.&endq;</Q> Which, by the way, is a proof that they look'd upon her Grace as con&s;tituted Lady-Trea&s;urer, to di&s;tribute the Pretender's Medals.</P>
<P>The Crime of the Advocates is aggrava|ted by this, That they not only knew tho&s;e Proceedings to be again&s;t Law, but ob&s;ti|nately per&s;i&s;ted in them, tho they were told &s;o by &s;ome of their own Number, and particularly by Sir <HI>James Stuart</HI> her Maje&s;ty's Sollicitor, who by virtue of his Office, as well as by Principle, was oblig'd to rebuke them. This I take to be a plain Di&s;covery of a latent Principle, which tho
<PB N="12" REF="11">
the Faction have &s;ometimes expre&s;s'd upon occa&s;ion, they have not dared &s;o publickly to own till now, <HI>viz.</HI> That the Acts made &s;ince the Revolution are no Laws, but the Effects of <HI>Rebellion, u&s;urping Tyranny, and Whiggery,</HI> as Mr. <HI>Dunda&s;s,</HI> out of his exube|rant Zeal, thinks fit to word it.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Frazer</HI>'s cogent Argument comes next to be con&s;ider'd, <HI>viz.</HI> <Q>&startq;That &s;ince they had receiv'd the Medal of <HI>Oliver,</HI> who de&s;erv'd to be hang'd, he thought it de|fended the receiving of this.&endq;</Q> I am apt to think this learned Gentleman was not aware that the Parallel was more exact than he'll be willing to allow; but with this Di&s;advantage to the Pretender, That he is actually condemn'd to &s;uch an infa|mous Puni&s;hment by the Bill of Attainder, while he is yet alive; whereas <HI>Oliver</HI> was not condemn'd till after his Death. Be|&s;ides, his U&s;urpation is under the Cover of Fraud, whereas <HI>Oliver</HI>'s was by Force; which is the more honourable of the two, becau&s;e we have a Chance to defend our Pur&s;e from a Highway-Man, which we can|not &s;o ea&s;ily do from a Pick-pocket or Night-&s;trouler, that does his Work in the dark. This can't be thought too &s;evere, con&s;idering that the be&s;t Title which the Pretender's Friends have yet &s;hew'd for his Right to the Crown, is, that of a Warm|ing Pan, flyly convey'd under the Bed-Clothes. It mu&s;t be own'd indeed, that tho in other Re&s;pects the Parallel is not &s;o ju&s;t; yet 'tis more to the Di&s;honour of Mr. <HI>Fra|zer</HI> and his A&s;&s;ociates, who receiv'd the
<PB N="13" REF="12">
Pretender's Medal as that of their pre|&s;ent Sovereign, and in Affirmation of his Title; whereas that of <HI>Oliver</HI> was re|ceiv'd only as a Document of a Hi&s;to|ry, which the Nation has more Cau&s;e to remember than to be in Love with: Be|&s;ides, that Medal &s;ets up no Rival to the Title of her Maje&s;ty, or to that of the <HI>Ha|nover</HI> Family. So that upon the whole, tho&s;e Gentlemen gave Mr. <HI>Frazer</HI> a very full and pertinent An&s;wer, who advis'd to &s;u&s;pend receiving the Medal till the Pretender was hang'd.</P>
<P>We come next to Mr. <HI>Dunda&s;s</HI>'s learn|ed <HI>Speech,</HI> and cannot but ob&s;erve the A|greement betwixt that Gentleman's Ora|tory and Arguments, and tho&s;e of &s;ome of our modern Addre&s;&s;ers. He alledges, that to di&s;pute the Right of Blood, which is only a &s;ynonimous Term for what our Ad|dre&s;&s;ers call <HI>Hereditary Right,</HI> is to affront the Queen, and bring her Title in que&s;|tion. Whether tho&s;e Gentlemen will thank him for this natural Commentary on their Addre&s;&s;es, is not material; but we have rea&s;on to thank him for &s;peaking out &s;o plain, what they did only by halves. I'm afraid tho it will be found, that Mr. <HI>Dun|da&s;s,</HI> in&s;tead of defending her Maje&s;ty's Ti|tle by this Propo&s;ition, arraigns that of her Maje&s;ty, and of all her Predece&s;&s;ors of the Family of <HI>Stuart:</HI> for it is plain, they deriv'd their Title not from Proximi|ty of Blood, if we may credit the Laws and Hi&s;tories of <HI>Scotland;</HI> but from an Act of Parliament, upon a Revolution, by
<PB N="14" REF="13">
which <HI>Baliol,</HI> tho next in Blood was de|thron'd, and all his Po&s;terity declar'd un|capable of the Succe&s;&s;ion, which was &s;ettled upon <HI>Robert Bruce</HI> and his l&s;&s;ue, from whom her Maje&s;ty is the twelfth or thir|teenth in lineal De&s;cent, by the Marriage of the Family of <HI>Stuart</HI> with <HI>Bruce</HI>'s Daugh|ter. This makes it evident, that if <HI>Here|ditary Right</HI> be Divine and Indefea&s;ible, the Line of <HI>Stuarts</HI> were U&s;urpers <HI>ab initio;</HI> &s;o much is her Maje&s;ty and a dozen of her Royal Ance&s;tors, oblig'd to the Patrons of this Doctrine.</P>
<P>But further, Mr. <HI>Dunda&s;s,</HI> who is a Law|yer by Profe&s;&s;ion, ought to know that the Parliament of <HI>Scotland,</HI> in order to prevent all &s;uch Di&s;putes about the Succe&s;&s;ion as happen'd in tho&s;e Days, did make an Act, That in ca&s;e of any future Competition for the Crown, the Controver&s;y &s;hould be determin'd by Parliament; and that it was made an Article of their League with <HI>France,</HI> That whoever the States adjudged it to, &s;hould be &s;upported by the Power of that Kingdom, as the <HI>Scots</HI> were oblig'd to &s;up|port the like Deci&s;ion by the States of <HI>France,</HI> if any &s;uch happen'd with relation to their Crown: &s;o little was Indefea&s;ible <HI>Heredi|tary Right</HI> under&s;tood then in either of tho&s;e Kingdoms. He may likewi&s;e know, that it did never obtain in <HI>Scotland,</HI> till &s;ince the Union of the two Crowns, when a few Pa|ra&s;ites thought it the be&s;t way of making their Court. For this we cann't have a better Voucher, than the Hi&s;tory of <HI>John Major</HI> a <HI>Scotch</HI> Man, a Papi&s;t and Profe&s;&s;or
<PB N="15" REF="14">
of Divinity in <HI>France;</HI> who in his Hi&s;tory dedicated to K. <HI>James</HI> V. of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and fir&s;t printed in 1527. <HI>Lib.</HI> 4. <HI>Fol.</HI> 76, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> of <HI>A&s;cen&s;ius</HI>'s Edition, maintains the Ju&s;tice of <HI>Baliol</HI>'s being dethron'd,</P>
<P N="1">1. Becau&s;e he was unfit to Reign, for ha|ving betray'd the Rights of the Kingdom to <HI>Edward</HI> I. of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. Becau&s;e the Kings of <HI>Scotland</HI> derive their Right from the People.</P>
<P N="3">3. Becau&s;e they had a Power to deprive the King and his Po&s;terity if they de&s;erv'd it, as well as to enthrone them.</P>
<P N="4">4. That the Crown may be di&s;pos'd of as &s;hall be mo&s;t to the Advantage of the Re|publick.</P>
<P N="5">5. That Controver&s;ies about the Crown, ought to be determin'd by Parliament; with &s;everal other Arguments which 'tis needle&s;s to in&s;i&s;t upon.</P>
<P>But we have a later In&s;tance than that: The States of <HI>Scotland</HI> dethron'd Q. <HI>Mary</HI> for her Tyranny; and &s;et up her Son K. <HI>James</HI> VI. of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and afterwards the Fir&s;t of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> in her &s;tead. This Right of the States was never que&s;tion'd by that Prince him&s;elf, and their Proceedings were approv'd by the Parliament of <HI>England,</HI> who &s;ollicited Q. <HI>Elizabeth</HI> to put Q. <HI>Mary</HI> to Death, for a Con&s;piracy again&s;t her Per|&s;on and Government. And when it was objected that Q. <HI>Mary</HI> was a Foreign So|vereign, and therefore not &s;ubject to the Juri&s;diction of <HI>England;</HI> they an&s;wer'd, That &s;he was then no Sovereign, becau&s;e ju&s;tly depriv'd of her Authority by her own Sub|jects;
<PB N="16" REF="15">
as appears by Sir <HI>Simon d' Ewes</HI>'s Journal.</P>
<P>By all this it is plain, That Mr. <HI>Dunda&s;s</HI> and his A&s;&s;ociates, di&s;cover either a gro&s;s Ignorance of their own Con&s;titution, or a traiterous Hatred to it, when they call the Revolution, the Dethronement of the late K. <HI>James,</HI> and the Exclu&s;ion of the Popi&s;h Line, <HI>Rebellion, &V;&s;urping Tyranny, and Whig|gery;</HI> &s;ince it was warranted by &s;uch noble and unque&s;tionable Precedents, and &s;uppor|ted by better Documents than the Preten|det's Half-Crown Medal.</P>
<P>'Tis not worth while to take notice of Mr. <HI>Dunda&s;s</HI>'s &s;currilous Language to the Gentlemen who oppos'd tho&s;e trea&s;onable Proceedings, any farther than as it &s;hews the Fury with which the Jacobite Principles in|&s;pire tho&s;e who entertain them. 'Tis not po&s;&s;ible for the&s;e Men to keep within bounds; they dive&s;t them&s;elves at once not only of all Principles of Loyalty and Chri&s;tianity, but even of Humanity. Nothing but &s;uch a Degeneracy cou'd make one Gentleman give &s;uch Language to another in the face of a Society compos'd of Men of Families, and of the be&s;t Education that <HI>Europe</HI> affords. For be&s;ides what they learn at their own Schools and Univer&s;ities, the Gentlemen of that Faculty do generally travel abroad, and &s;tudy in tho&s;e foreign Univer&s;ities that are mo&s;t fam'd for the Civil Law: So that they have always had the Reputation, as the Dutche&s;s ju&s;tly ob&s;erves, of being as Learn|ed and Gentlemanlike a Society as any in <HI>Europe.</HI> But the&s;e Proceedings &s;hew that
<PB N="17" REF="16">
too many of 'em have forfeited all Title to that Character, and that neither Birth nor Education are &s;ufficient Antidotes again&s;t the Poy&s;on of &s;lavi&s;h Principles, of which Mr. <HI>Dunda&s;s</HI> is too pregnant an In&s;tance.</P>
<P>It is not doubted but the Government will enquire into the Grounds of tho&s;e Hopes which that Gentleman &s;o confidently expre&s;&s;es in the name of him&s;elf and of his Con&s;tituents, that <HI>the King and the Royal Fa|mily,</HI> as he thinks fit to call 'em, are to be &s;o &s;peedily <HI>re&s;tor'd.</HI> For it is &s;carce to be &s;uppos'd that &s;o many Gentlemen wou'd take &s;uch a dangerous Step as this, except they rely on &s;ome powerful Support that is capa|ble of protecting them again&s;t po&s;itive Law. They are not ignorant of the &s;everal Acts which have pa&s;s'd to extingui&s;h the Hopes of the <HI>pretended Prince of Wales,</HI> and for the Security of her Maje&s;ty's Per&s;on, and of the Crown in the Prote&s;tant Line: Nor can they forget the Act pa&s;s'd in the 7th of her Maje&s;ty, for improving the Union of the two Kingdoms, that makes the Laws re|lating to High Trea&s;on, and the Proceed|ings thereupon, the &s;ame in both parts of <HI>Great Britain.</HI> They mu&s;t therefore either be po&s;&s;e&s;s'd with a Spirit of Madne&s;s, or think them&s;elves &s;ure of &s;ome impregnable Defence again&s;t tho&s;e Laws. It has indeed been a long time ob&s;erv'd, that the Jaco|bite Party in <HI>Scotland</HI> have been very in&s;o|lent, and acted as if there were no &s;uch Laws in being. But whatever Rea&s;ons tho&s;e who have been intru&s;ted with the Admini|&s;tration in that Country have had for their Connivance at &s;uch Practices hitherto, it is
<PB N="18" REF="17">
certainly high time now that tho&s;e Rea&s;ons &s;hou'd be &s;uper&s;eded, when in &s;uch a Society as the Faculty of Advocates, who are by their Office Mini&s;ters of Law and Ju&s;tice, her Maje&s;ty's Title and that of the Family of <HI>Hanover,</HI> is not only avowedly &s;truck at, but the bringing in of the Pretender, and the De&s;truction of the Revolution-Party is &s;o boldly threaten'd, under the Notion of <HI>giving the fini&s;hing Blow to Rebellion, u&s;urping Tyranny, and Whiggery.</HI></P>
<P>'Tis certainly high time for tho&s;e who are Friends to her Maje&s;ty's Title and Per|&s;on, and to the <HI>Hanover</HI> Succe&s;&s;ion, to take the Alarm, and to pu&s;h on a thorow Enqui|ry into the Rea&s;on of tho&s;e Mens extraor|dinary Confidence; &s;ince nothing le&s;s than all that is dear to us as Men and Chri&s;tians lies at &s;take, if that Party &s;ucceed in their De&s;igns.</P>
<P>'Tis perhaps without Precedent, that a Body of Men who live by the Law, &s;hou'd &s;o avowedly fly in the Face of it, and &s;et up the Title of an attainted Traytor, in oppo&s;ition to a Prince&s;s on the Throne, on pretence of doing her Honour, and &s;upport|ing that very Title which they &s;trike at. Such manife&s;t Hypocri&s;y in other Ca&s;es, might perhaps be pa&s;s'd over with Laugh|ter and Contempt; but in this it calls for a more &s;erious Regard, and the Puni&s;hment it de&s;erves. High-Trea&s;on is too dangerous an edg-Tool to play with. We are not, for the &s;ake of the High Church Cant of <HI>Indefea|&s;ible Hereditary Right,</HI> and <HI>&V;nlimited Pa&s;&s;ive-Obedience,</HI> to &s;uffer our &s;elves to be bully'd out of our Fortunes, Lives and Religion.
<PB N="19" REF="18">
When any Church comes to &s;uch a Height, 'tis high time for the State to take it down.</P>
<P>The&s;e Men having thus thrown off the Di&s;gui&s;e, it is time for the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> High-Church Party to explain them&s;elves, by Addre&s;&s;es of Abhorrence of tho&s;e Mens Pro|ceedings, except they wou'd have the World believe they are acting the &s;ame Part un|der a Mask, which the <HI>Scotch</HI> Advocates act without one. If their Zeal for her Maje&s;ty and the <HI>Hanover</HI> Succe&s;&s;ion be &s;uch as they pretend, 'tis time for them to vindicate their old Addre&s;&s;es from &s;uch a traiterous Commentary, by new ones; that the World may be convinc'd that <HI>Hereditary-Right</HI> and <HI>Pa&s;&s;ive-Obedience</HI> have not the &s;ame Meaning in <HI>England</HI> which the Popi&s;h and Epi&s;co|pal Party put upon 'em in <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>'Tis hop'd they will now &s;ee, that their Patronage of the Epi&s;copal Conventi|clers there, has been very ill plac'd, and that they will no more call the Pro&s;ecution of Traytors, a Per&s;ecution of the Church of <HI>England.</HI> The&s;e Men had the Boldne&s;s upon her Maje&s;ty's Acce&s;&s;ion to the Throne, to addre&s;s her not only for their Liberty of Wor&s;hip, but to be admitted into Benefices without taking the Oaths appointed by Law. They had the Confidence to pro|po&s;e it in the Parliament of <HI>Scotland;</HI> and when the Que&s;tion was ask'd, whether in ca&s;e &s;uch a Liberty was allow'd them, they would be willing to take the &s;aid Oaths? their Patrons reply'd, <HI>That if the Oaths were impos'd, 'twou'd be no Favour.</HI> The principal Argument made u&s;e of by the <HI>Scotch</HI> Epi&s;copal Clergy to obtain this from her Maje&s;ty, was,
<PB N="20" REF="19">
That they were her Father's Friends. This was a pretty bold-Step from the Pulpit: But had the Advocates their will, they wou'd make one much bolder from the Bench, &s;ince they endeavour to excu&s;e their Trea|&s;on again&s;t her Maje&s;ty, by being Friends to her Brother! God pre&s;erve us from &s;uch brotherly Love. We are &s;ure the Apo&s;tles had no &s;uch Meaning, when they &s;aid, <HI>Let brotherly Love continue.</HI></P>
<P>We are oblig'd however to tho&s;e Gentle|men for &s;peaking &s;o plainly, and telling us what we are to expect when the Pretender comes, which is no le&s;s than that a fini&s;hing Stroke &s;hall be given to our Liberties and Religion, by the utter Extirpation of what they are pleas'd to call <HI>Rebellion, u&s;urping Tyranny, and Whiggery.</HI> We have no rea&s;on to doubt, but &s;ome of tho&s;e learned Gen|tlemen have been con&s;ulted in penning his Declaration, which to be &s;ure will be con|cer$$'d in mode&s;ter terms; but we thank 'em for publi&s;hing the Commentary before the Text, and telling us, That the Whigs are to be treated as <HI>pitiful Scoundrels, Vermin, and Mu&s;hrooms.</HI> This is fair Warning for the Whigs to prepare for a Bru&s;h, before the Papi&s;ts and Jacobites bring their Faggots. The <HI>Se$tch</HI> Advocates have given us a &s;econd $Word$ of the Trumpet, &s;omewhat louder than that &s;ounded at St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s by <HI>Sacheverel.</HI> They have &s;ummon'd every Man to his Tent again&s;t the Pretender comes; and have bold|l$ proclaim'd, That they have no part in <HI>ANNE,</HI> nor Inheritance in <HI>Sophia</HI> and her <HI>Son:</HI> But we make no doubt, that whatever the <HI>H$gh-Church Party of</HI> I&s;rael <HI>may do, the</HI>

<P>SInce the Defence of the Pretender's Title is now become &s;o fa&s;hionable, that many &s;carce think it a Crime, and others do it more covertly, by crying up the Doctrine of <HI>Hereditary-Right,</HI> in which they think them&s;elves patroniz'd by numbers of our Clergy, who wou'd per&s;uade their blind Followers, that it is the Doctrine of the Church of <HI>England;</HI> it mayn't be improper to conclude the&s;e <HI>Remarks</HI> with an Account how our Laws &s;tand in that re&s;pect, to prevent, if po&s;&s;ible, the Peoples being fur|ther deluded by tho&s;e fal&s;e Pretences, and e&s;pecial|ly by &s;uch as wou'd traiterou&s;ly make &s;ome of the Acts of King <HI>Charles</HI> II. which &s;eem to look that way, the Mea&s;ures of our pre&s;ent Obedience: but how truly, will be &s;een by the following Acts.</P>

Let them produce a better Autho|rity for their Doctrine if they can, than is here done for that of the Whigs; and till then, let them not oppo&s;e the Cant and Addre&s;&s;es of their High Church to the Laws of the State.
