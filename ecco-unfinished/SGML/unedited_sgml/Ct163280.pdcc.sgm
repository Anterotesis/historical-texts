<HEAD>PROLOGUE.</HEAD>
<L>IN this ble&s;t land, thro' ev'ry varying age,</L>
<L>Public and private life have had <HI>their rage.</HI></L>
<L>In good King Arthur's days, with cumb'rous &s;hield,</L>
<L>The Iron champions pranc'd upon the field,</L>
<L>Relentle&s;s beauty bade the knights advance,</L>
<L>And bear the rage romantic on their lance.</L>
<L>From length of time this fury found it's death,</L>
<L>And wi&s;er fa&s;hions mark'd Elizabeth.</L>
<L>Her mode&s;t dames were form'd of milde&s;t &s;tuff,</L>
<L>But check'd pre&s;umption by a mon&s;trous ruff,</L>
<L>Their breakfa&s;t <HI>rage</HI> all delicacy &s;hocks,</L>
<L>Early they pick'd the pinions of an ox,</L>
<L>Then rode in &s;tate behind the &s;cepter'd fair,</L>
<L>On hor&s;e-back&mdash;full as well as my Lord Mayor.</L>
<L>The&s;e modes howe'er are alter'd, and of late,</L>
<L>Beef, but not mode&s;ty is out of date;</L>
<L>For now in&s;tead of rich &s;irloins, we &s;ee,</L>
<L>Green calipa&s;h, and yellow callipee;</L>
<L>Now ladies &s;hine from Phaetons afar,</L>
<L>And very &s;oon perhaps may learn to &s;par;</L>
<L>At lei&s;ure hours they work &s;ettees, and chairs,</L>
<L>Or wa&s;te their youth on puddings, or on prayers,</L>
<L>Each mode&s;t dame may quit her cara &s;po&s;a,</L>
<L>To take a hug with Humphries or Mendoza.</L>
<L>As thus the manners differ, writers try,</L>
<L>To trace the whim&s;ical variety,</L>
<L>With ob&s;ervation ju&s;t, and mirror true,</L>
<L>Pre&s;ent each reigning &s;olly to the view.</L>
<PB REF="4">
<L>Yet, hold, our author's &s;cene all <HI>rage</HI> outgoes,</L>
<L>A new, excentric character he &s;hews;</L>
<L>No doughty Quixotte, and no modern fighter,</L>
<L>A dramatizing hero, play&mdash;inditer,</L>
<L>One who to gain applau&s;e, like wits in vogue,</L>
<L>Torments with Prologue, or with Epilogue.</L>
<L>At every hou&s;e with <HI>incident</HI> he meets</L>
<L>And thinks he &s;ees proce&s;&s;ions&mdash;in the &s;treets,</L>
<L>In common life will unities expect</L>
<L>Looks up to politics for &s;tage effect,</L>
<L>And &s;o mi&s;led, that if his wife &s;hould die,</L>
<L>"She's made a charming exit," he would cry.</L>
<L>But let me not our Comedy fore&s;tal,</L>
<L>Or court your judgment till the curtain fall,</L>
<L>Mean while we'll &s;trive your patience to beguile</L>
<L>And win from lovelie&s;t lips the bright'ning &s;mile.</L>
<L>Such as it is we give it to your view,</L>
<L>And tru&s;t <HI>our cau&s;e to candour,</HI> and to you.</L>

<SPEAKER>MARIANNE.</SPEAKER>
<P>BUT I tell you I will $word$ out&mdash;I didn't come to Bath to be conf$$'d, $word$ I won't&mdash;I hate all their company but &s;weet Mi&s;s Courtney's.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LET.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why I declare Mi&s;s Marianne, you grow wor&s;e and wor&s;e every day, your country manners will be the ruin of you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MAR.</SPEAKER>
<P>Don't talk about that Letty, it was a &s;hame to bring me up in the country! If I had been properly taken care of I might have done great things, I might have mar|ried the P$et I danc'd with at the ball, but it's all over now&mdash;I &s;hall never get a hu&s;band, and what's wor&s;e my aunt did it on purpo&s;e! She ruin'd me, Letty, that no|body el&s;e might.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LET.</SPEAKER>
<P>How you talk! I hope Mi&s;s Courtney hasn't taught you all this.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MAR.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, &s;he's a dear creature! &s;he has taught me many things but nothing improper, I'm &s;ure.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LET.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray has &s;he taught you why &s;he never plays any tune but the one we heard ju&s;t now?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MAR.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, and if you'll keep it a &s;ecret I'll tell you, Letty; Mr Harry Neville taught it her la&s;t &s;ummer, and now &s;he is always playing it becau&s;e it puts her in mind of the dear man, when it is ended don't you ob&s;erve how &s;he &s;ighs from the bottom of her dear little heart.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LET.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why I thought they had quarrell'd?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MAR.</SPEAKER>
<P>So they have, &s;he won't &s;ee him, and I believe my aunt Lady Waitfort has been the occa&s;ion of it; Poor Mr Neville! I wi&s;h I could a&s;&s;i&s;t him! for indeed Letty,
<PB N="6" REF="6">I always pity any body that has been cro&s;s'd in love&mdash;it may be one's own ca&s;e one day or other, you know.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LET.</SPEAKER>
<P>True, and for the &s;ame rea&s;on, I &s;uppo&s;e you rejoice when it is &s;ucce&s;sful? I am &s;ure now the intended marriage of Lady Waitfort and Lord Scratch gives you plea&s;ure?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MAR.</SPEAKER>
<P>What, the country gentleman who has lately come to the title? no if you'll believe me I don't like him at all, he's a &s;our old fellow, is always abu&s;ing our &s;ex, and thinks there is only one good woman under Heaven, now I'm &s;ure that's a mi&s;take; for I know I'm a good woman, and I think, Letty, you are another?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LET.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, I hope &s;o, tho' I confe&s;s I think your aunt a better than either of us.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MAR.</SPEAKER>
<P>More &s;hame for you, &s;he is a woman of &s;enti|ment, and hums you over with her &s;entiments and flou|ri&s;hes about purity and feelings! faith &s;he ought to be a&s;hamed of her&s;elf! no other woman would talk in that manner.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LET.</SPEAKER>
<P>You mi&s;take her, &s;he is a woman of virtue, and can't help feeling for the vices and misfortunes of others.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MAR.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then why can't &s;he do as I have done, Letty? keep her feelings to her&s;elf &mdash; If I had given way to them half as much as &s;he has&mdash;Oh Lord! I don't know what might have been the con&s;equences?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LET.</SPEAKER>
<P>For &s;hame! you never hear Lady Waitfort &s;peak ill of any body.</P>

<P>No, how &s;hou'd &s;he, when &s;he &s;peaks of nobody but her&s;elf.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LET.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well your opinion is of little weight&mdash;my lord &s;ees her merit, and is come to Bath on purpo&s;e to marry her&mdash;He thinks her a prodigy of goodne&s;s.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MAR.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then pray let him have her; every fool knows; &s;o to be &s;ure does he Letty, that a prodigy of goodne&s;s is a very rare thing &mdash; but when he finds her out? faith it will be a rare joke when he finds her out.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LET.</SPEAKER>
<P>Shameful, Mi&s;s Marianne! pray do &s;peak a lit|tle intelligibly, and remember your aunt's favourite ob|&s;ervation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>What is it, I have forgot?</P>

<P>Then your lady&s;hip is certain Harry Neville is returned?</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. WAIT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, the ungrateful man arrived la&s;t night, and as I yet mean to con&s;ult his happine&s;s, I have writ|ten to him to come to me this evening, but I will ever oppo&s;e his union with my Lord's ward, Loui&s;a Courtney, becau&s;e I think it will be the ruin of them both; and you know, Willoughby, one cannot forget their feeling on the&s;e occa&s;ions.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WILL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Certainly&mdash;but Ennui the time killer who&s;e only being in life is to murder the hours is al&s;o ju&s;t arrived, and my Lord is re&s;olved on his marrying Loui&s;a in&s;tantly, only becau&s;e he'll make a quiet member for his borough in the we&s;t.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. WAIT.</SPEAKER>
<P>True, but for various rea&s;ons, I am deter|mined &s;he &s;hall be yours, yet it mu&s;t be done artfully&mdash;my circum&s;tances are derang'd and an alliance with my Lord is my only hope of relief, &s;uch are the fruits of virtue, Willoughby!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WILL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well but her fortune is entirely dependant on my lord's con&s;ent, and how is that to be obtained? You know I'm no favourite, and Floriville is a great one.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. WAIT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, the &s;tage is his aver&s;ion, and &s;ome way or other&mdash;I have it&mdash;it's an odd thought, but may do much, &s;uppo&s;e we tell him Floriville has written a <HI>play?</HI></P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>WILL.</SPEAKER>
<P>The luckie&s;t thought in the world, it will make him hate him directly.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. WAIT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, leave it to me&mdash;I'll explain the mat|ter to my&s;elf, and my life on't it proves &s;ucce&s;sful; you &s;ee Willoughby my only &s;y&s;tem is to promote happine&s;s.</P>
