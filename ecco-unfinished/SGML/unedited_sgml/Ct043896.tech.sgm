<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>TO prevent the Readers of the following Work from
entertaining expectations re&s;pecting it which it would ill
&s;atisfy, it is nece&s;&s;ary to acquaint them that the Author hath
not had the pre&s;umption even to attempt a full, hi&s;torical
narration of the fall of the Peruvian Empire. To de&s;cribe
that important event with preci&s;ion, and to di&s;play with ju&s;t
force the various cau&s;es which combined to produce it, would
require all the energy of genius, all the &s;trong colouring
of the mo&s;t glowing imagination. Con&s;cious of her utter
inability to execute &s;uch a de&s;ign, &s;he hath only aimed at
giving a &s;imple detail of a few incidents in that affecting
and romantic Hi&s;tory; where the unparalleled &s;ufferings of
an innocent and amiable People afford the fine&s;t &s;ubjects for
<PB N="viii" REF="7">
true pathos, while their climate, intirely di&s;&s;imilar to our
own, furni&s;hes new and ample materials for poetic de|&s;cription.</P>
<P>She offers this Poem to the Public impre&s;&s;ed with gratitude
for the indulgence with which it hath honoured her former,
unowned Production, <HI>EDWIN</HI> and <HI>ELTRUDA;</HI> yet trembling
le&s;t, in the temerity of a farther effort to engage its attention,
and obtain its favour, &s;he &s;hould forfeit, by the feeblene&s;s of
a Performance inadequate to fulfil that anxious hope, all
claim to future encouragement.</P>
