<P>VI$IAINY OF Stock-Jobbers DETECTED, And the Cau&s;es of the Late RUN UPON THE BANK and BANKERS Di&s;covered and Con&s;idered.</P>

<P>IT has more then once been foretold that Stock Jobbers and Brokers wou'd Ruine the Trade, and &s;everal Times they have bid fair for the Perfor|mance.</P>
<P>But never was a greater Wound given to the Trade in General, than now; Never &s;o unhappi|ly Tim'd to the Di&s;advantage both of the Publick Revenue and the Current Credit of the Nation, nor never was there &s;o much Bare fac'd Villany acted, in the Affairs of Publick Trade as their is now.</P>
<P>Trade in general is Built upon, and &s;upported by two e&s;&s;ential and principal Foundations, <HI>Viz.</HI> Money and Credit, as the Sun and Moon in their <HI>Diurnal Motion</HI> alternately <HI>Enlighten</HI> and <HI>Envigorate</HI> the World, &s;o the&s;e two E&s;&s;entials maintain and pre&s;erve our Trade; they are the Life and Soul of Trade, and they are the &s;upport of one another too. Money rai&s;es Credit, and Credit in its turn is an Equivalent to Money.</P>
<P>From hence it follows, That Trade always bears a proportion to Money and Credit; and con&s;equently, they who by any methods Dimini&s;h the Stock of Ca&s;h or Credit, equally injure our Trade.</P>
<P>Tho' it would &s;eem needle&s;s to go back to particular Ca&s;es for the proof of this A&s;&s;ertion,
<PB N="2" REF="3" MS="Y">
yet it may not be ami&s;s to &s;ee a little from whence it comes to pa&s;s, That our Trade is le&s;s now the War is over, than it was before it began.</P>
<P>The calling in our Coin vi&s;ibly put a &s;top to Trade, becau&s;e <HI>the Stream which drove the Mill, the Oil that mov'd the Wheel,</HI> was ceas'd. The prodi|gious Paper-Credit which pa&s;t in <HI>Lombard-&s;treet,</HI> and which &s;upply'd more than twice the Quantity of the Coin, equally &s;upported Trade with the Money, and &s;unk at once with the Coin.</P>
<P>The Merchants finding the &s;en&s;ible lo&s;s to Trade, for want both of that Money and Credit, put their Invention on the tenters; and found out the Expedient of a Bank. The Exchequer al&s;o feeling the lo&s;s of the Coin &s;upplied with an imaginary Species in Exchequer-Bills, and yet both the&s;e fail'd in the Performance. So im|po&s;&s;ible it is to force Credit without Ca&s;h. For till the ready Money began to appear again, the Brokers and Jobbers made a prey of all Man|kind in the matter of Bills; and in &s;pight of the endeavours of the Bank or the Exchequer, they bought and &s;old their Notes at the &s;hameful Di&s;|count of 10, to 16 and 20 <HI>l. per Cent.</HI></P>
<P>I &s;hall not think it needful to view the ill effect this had upon our Trade; how the needy Trades-men, who &s;old their Goods at common
<PB N="3" REF="4" MS="Y">
rates, were fain to Di&s;count more than their pro|fit to get their Money. How the Exchequer-Notes de&s;ign'd for a currency in Payments were Jobb'd about the Town; and by the Policy of the&s;e Gentlemen put upon the Trades-men, in order to be bought again at high Di&s;counts, and then Engro&s;&s;ed again by the Money'd Men, who obtain'd the Di&s;count as a <HI>Premio</HI> added to the Intere&s;t upon the Originals.</P>
<P>I could fill a large Volume with the relation of &s;uch Particulars, and ea&s;ily make out the dammage that befell our Trade in General; but I have in&s;tanc't this only to prove how fatal the &s;inking of Paper&punc;Credit has been to the Nation.</P>
<P>The &s;upply of new Money from the Mint, and the recovery of the Bank has reviv'd our Trade; and with our Money-Credit al&s;o began to revive: For Credit always follows plenty of Ca&s;h, as naturally as the effect does the cau&s;e.</P>
<P>But, as if &s;ome ill Fate attended the Publick affairs, and we were not to recover our former magnitude in Trade; but always to be Sacrifiz'd to the Follies and Intere&s;ts of particular Men; here is another General blow given to the Publick Credit, and a &s;top to the Currency of Bills. That it will have a more Fatal effect than yet appears,
<PB N="4" REF="5" MS="Y">
I believe every Body expects; but I &s;hall not &s;o much predict the Con&s;equences, as endeavour to Detect the Cau&s;es.</P>
<P>Any one might have fore&s;een, That the Strife and Contention of our two Rival <HI>Ea&s;t-India Companies</HI> would produce &s;ome more than ordinary Effect; and that the rai&s;ing &s;tock, of all &s;orts to a Value &s;o much above the <HI>Intrin&s;ick,</HI> mu&s;t have &s;ome fatal I&s;&s;ue, and would fall &s;ome where at la&s;t &s;o heavy as to be felt by the whole body of Trade.</P>
<P>But be&s;ides this, Twas ea&s;y to &s;ee that the Differ|ent Intere&s;t of Parties would lay open the Publick to be Injur'd by both of them.</P>
<P>Perhaps 'tis ea&s;ier to Demon&s;trate, That this mi&s;chief is the contrivance of Per&s;ons and Parties, than it is to di&s;cover the Per&s;ons and prove the Fact. But on the other Hand 'tis not very diffi|cult neither to Trace it back to its Original, and Detect the very Per&s;ons.</P>
<P>The de&s;ign of this Paper is not an Invective at any particular Per&s;on or Party, nor is it wrote to court or plea&s;e either &s;ide; but if any thing be &s;aid which touches or expo&s;es the Guilty, 'tis that they, if they plea&s;e, may &s;ee their Errors; and if not, the Nation may take care not to be fur|ther injured by them.</P>
<P>If that new <HI>Mi&s;tery</HI> or <HI>Machine</HI> of Trade we
<PB N="5" REF="6" MS="Y">
call <HI>Stock-Jobbing,</HI> be fir&s;t prov'd to be at the bottom of all this mi&s;chief; I hope the Great Repre&s;entative of the Nation, the <HI>Parliament,</HI> will need very few Arguments to &s;atisfie them of its being a Publick Grievance.</P>
<P>The Old <HI>Ea&s;t&punc;India</HI> Stock by the arts of the&s;e unaccountable People, has within 10 Years or thereabouts, without any material difference in the Intrin&s;ick value, been Sold from 300 <HI>l. per Cent.</HI> to 37 <HI>l. per Cent.</HI> from thence with fluxes and re|fluxes, as frequent as the Tides, it has been up at 150 <HI>l. per Cent.</HI> again; during all which differ|ences, It would puzzle a very good Arti&s;t to prove, That their real Stock <HI>(if they have any)</HI> &s;et lo&s;s and gain together, can have varied above 10 <HI>per Cent.</HI> upon the whole; nor can any Rea|&s;ons for the ri&s;e and fall of it be &s;hown, but the Politick management of the Stock-Jobbing Brokers; whereby, according to the Number of Buyers and Sellers, which 'tis al&s;o in their Power to make and manage at will, the Price &s;hall dance attend|ance on their de&s;igns, and ri&s;e and fall as they plea&s;e, without any regard to the Intrin&s;ick worth of the Stock.</P>
<P>The New <HI>Company,</HI> the Bank of <HI>England,</HI> the <HI>Exchequer,</HI> the whole Nation, as has been lately well ob&s;erv'd by the Author of <HI>The Free-Holders-Plea</HI>
<PB N="6" REF="7" MS="Y">
<HI>again&s;t Stock-Jobbidg, Elections of Parliament Mne</HI> is, or is in a fair way to be &s;ubjected to the &s;ame management.</P>
<P>To bring it home to the Ca&s;e in hand, The apparent de&s;ign of &s;ome People to ruin the Credit of the Nation by way of revenge, on a party who had oppo&s;ed them in other de&s;igns, &s;eems &s;o clear, that it hardly needs to be further ex|plained.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the Election of Parliament Men for the City of <HI>London</HI> was over, or &s;o far over as that it plainly appeared on which &s;ide it enclin'd, a certain Party prepar'd their mea&s;ures to bring about the very De&s;ign, which now we &s;ee &s;o broke out upon us.</P>
<P>And that any ob&s;erving People may recollect them&s;elves in the matter, it may be taken No|tice of,</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> That the old <HI>Company</HI> has ever &s;ince, and &s;ome time before, been ama&s;&s;ing to them&s;elves all the ready Money they could po&s;&s;ibly get, in order to form the De&s;ign, and make a general &s;carcity of Ca&s;h, at the &s;ame time &s;topping their hands as to Payments and Exports as much as they could; and &s;ome People pretend to &s;ay, they have a Million of Money by them in Specie.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="8" MS="Y">
From whence I only make two &s;hort ob|&s;ervations.</P>
<Q><P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> That we may &s;ee the Nations Enemies are Ma&s;ters of their mea&s;ures, and know the directe&s;t way to ruin us: For nothing cou'd be more Fatal to Trade and the publick Credit, than engro&s;&s;ing the current Ca&s;h, and keeping it from the Circula|tion, which is the Life of our Trade. <HI>But this is not the only thing in which the Old Company have injured our General Intere&s;t of Trade,</HI></P></Q>
<Q><P><HI>Secondly,</HI> 'Tis a &s;ign they do not live under a <HI>French</HI> Governmemt; and 'tis well for them they do not, tho' them&s;elves have been &s;o fond of that Intere&s;t; for a King of <HI>France</HI> might have &s;ent them Word, <HI>That Money being made to Circulate, if they did not know how to employ it, he did;</HI> and command them to lend it him, at <HI>3 per Cent.</HI></P></Q>
<P>All the while the Old <HI>Company</HI> were laying up the Ca&s;h, and dreining the Town of their ready Money, Guinea's e&s;pecially; another &s;ett of Men who are known to be in the &s;ame Intere&s;t, and to have concerted mea&s;ures together, laid up in the &s;ame proportion, all the Bank-Bills they could lay Hands on.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="9" MS="Y">
It is impo&s;&s;ible to imagine that two or three Men &s;hould lay by Bank-Notes to the Tune of 300000 Pounds, which had no running Intere&s;t upon them, and have no de&s;ign in it; they are known to be Men who under&s;tand their own Advantages better than &s;o, and have not rais'd &s;uch va&s;t Fortunes as they po&s;&s;e&s;s from &s;uch blind methods; but the ve&s;ting all their running Ca&s;h in Bank-Bills, the Old <HI>Company</HI> at the &s;ame time &s;ecuring all the ready Money, was the fir&s;t Pre|liminary of the de&s;ign which now broke out.</P>
<P>Things thus prepar'd, the next &s;troke at the Publick currency of Ca&s;h, was a report Poli|tickly rais'd and indu&s;triou&s;ly &s;pread abroad, that by a complaint from the Mint, <HI>which was non&s;ence in it &s;elf too,</HI> the Government was moved to cry down the <HI>French</HI> Pi&s;toles to 17 <HI>s.</HI> 1 <HI>d.</HI> and the Proclamation was in the Pre&s;s for&s;ooth every day; tho' neither Government nor Mint had then done any thing in the matter,</P>
<P>Thus the Town was prepar'd, the Guinea's was utterly vani&s;h'd, the Silver Money &s;o le&s;&s;en'd as to make a vi&s;ible &s;carcity; a &s;torm gathered for the Bank, Pi&s;toles made dubious; the next thing was the improving the approaching Se&s;&s;ions of Parliament, and the pro&s;pect of a War in <HI>Europe,</HI> to run down the Price of Stock; and
<PB N="9" REF="10" MS="Y">
when this was done, and all ripe for execution, the parties fall to Work; and fir&s;t they began with the Bank, and running hard upon them with Sums of &s;uch magnitude, as ea&s;ily di&s;covered the de&s;ign; allarum'd the Bank, who to return them their own kind, pu&s;h'd at their Capital Banker, and run him down pre&s;ently; and thus the Fight is begun.</P>
<P>But lea&s;t the Bank &s;hould be reliev'd from the Exchequer, they forme an attack there too; where about Fifty Thou&s;and Pounds in Exchequer-Bills pre&s;ent them&s;elves for Payment at once.</P>
<P>This alarum'd the Exchequer too, on which a new Sub&s;cription is call'd for by the Lords, for the exchanging Exchequer-Notes, and making them current; which Sub&s;cription we find goes on well, and if it comes to be fini&s;hed, and the Bank weathers this &s;torm, as 'tis not doubted it will; all this Hurricane may yet fall on them&s;elves; and it were only to be wi&s;h'd that the fall of Stocks wou'd effect none but &s;uch as have encourag'd this de&s;tructive <HI>Hydra;</HI> this new <HI>Cor|poration</HI> of <HI>Hell, Stock-Jobbing.</HI></P>
<P>But &s;ince there are a great many hone&s;t Gentlemen, and Trades-men concern'd, who&s;e Families and Fortunes are like to &s;uffer for it; 'tis worth while to ex|amine whether an Evil of &s;o Fatal a Nature to the
<PB N="10" REF="11" MS="Y">
Publick, &s;o De&s;tructive to Trade, and &s;o ruinous to the Publick Credit, ought not Effectually to be &s;uppre&s;t.</P>
<P>I cannot however forbear to blame the <HI>Bank</HI> of <HI>England,</HI> for Publi&s;hing at &s;uch a Juncture as this, their willingne&s;s to allow an Intere&s;t on their Seal'd Notes; which &s;eems too plain|to di&s;cover their fears of the Party, and is a downright begging of Credit. I &s;hall ask leave here to tell a &s;hort Story, &s;omthing allu&s;ive to this, and which will explain what I mean; whether the Reader plea&s;e to take it for a Par|able or a Hi&s;tory, 'tis all one to me, and will &s;erve my turn as well one way as another.</P>
<P>A certain Trades-Man in <HI>London</HI> had borrowed 2 Thou&s;and Pounds of a Scrivener at 6 <HI>per Cent.</HI> Intere&s;t, and had kept it in his Hands &s;ome time; but lo&s;&s;es coming upon him, and particularly one which &s;trook his Foundation; he began to appre|hend, that if it came to the Ears of that Creditor&punc; the Scrivener, he would call in his Money, and at that juncture, &s;uch a Demand would entirely ruin him.</P>
<P>To go to the Scrivener and give him a Bribe, to promi&s;e the continuing the Money; tho' he knew that &s;ort of People willing enough to take Money, yet he thought it lookt like le&s;&s;ening
<PB N="11" REF="12">
him&s;elf, and would injure his Reputation, and po&s;&s;ibly only &s;erve to make that certain, which yet was but doubtful, and put him upon calling for the Money &s;ooner than otherwi&s;e; upon which he re&s;olv'd on a quite contrary method.</P>
<P>He goes to the Scrivener, and tells him he had borrow'd &s;uch a Sum of Money on him, and paid him Intere&s;t for it; but he found the Intere&s;t of Money run high, and 'twas a hard thing for a Trades-Man to pay it, that 'twas but working for other Folks; for he found Trade was dull, and he gave long Credit and the like, and therefore in &s;hort, he de&s;ired him to take in the Money again, for he was unea&s;ie to be &s;o deep|ly in Debt.</P>
<P>The Scrivener ask'd him when he wou'd pay it, he told him that Afternoon, if he would &s;end the Bond to his Hou&s;e, he had order'd his Man to Tell up the Money.</P>
<P>The Scrivener told him, it was hard to put the Money on them without Warning, and wou'd be a Lo&s;s to his Client to oblige him to take it in before he was provided to put it out again, that if he had call'd it in, he wou'd a given him Three Months time to pay it in, and &s;o much Notice he expected.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="13" MS="Y">
Aye, but &s;ays the Trades-Man, that will be a Lo&s;s to me too, for I mu&s;t keep it by me, or el&s;e it may not be ready at the time. <HI>But,</HI> pray Sir, <HI>&s;aid the Scrive|ner,</HI> keep the Money, Trade may mend; a Man that has a Thou&s;and Pound by him, meets with Opportunities that he did not think on.</P>
<P>The Trades-man finding his De&s;ign take, an|&s;wers coldly <HI>No,</HI> and $o they parted; at next Meet|ing, the Scrivener &s;till pre&s;&s;ing him too keep the Money, he tells him; <HI>Look ye</HI> Sir, <HI>you de&s;ire me to keep this Money, if your Client will abate me</HI> 1 per Cent. <HI>of Intere&s;t, I'll keep it longer:</HI> The Scrivener agrees, and the Trades-man an&s;wer'd his End, whereas had he gone and offer'd him 1 <HI>per Cent</HI> more for Intere&s;t or Continuance, 'tis Ten to One but they had call'd for their Money.</P>
<P>I leave any body to apply this Story to the Bank of E$$land, offering double Intere&s;t at a time, when $ Storm threatned them, they indeed are the be&s;t judges of their own Affairs; but if they $span$ their Ground boldly without it, I am $span$ with &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, their Credit had &s;t$$$ cle$rer.</P>
<P>The Credit of the Bank of <HI>England</HI> does not immediately con&s;i&s;t in the reality of their Foun|dation:
<PB N="13" REF="14" MS="Y">
Sir, &s;ure it does originally depend upon the Goodne&s;s of their Bottom, but the more im|mediate Credit of their Proceeding, depends up|on the currency of their Bills, and the currency of their Bills depends upon their immediate Pay; <HI>the Bank has no Advantage of the meane&s;t Gold&s;mith as to their current Bills,</HI> for no longer than their Payments continue punctual and free, no longer will any Man take their Bills, or give them Credit for Money.</P>
<P>All the Credit which remains to the Bank af|ter their Payment comes to &s;top, <HI>if ever &s;uch a time &s;hall be,</HI> is that People have a Satisfaction; that at long run their Principle is &s;afe, and their Bottom will pay their Debts: this is the Credit of their Stock, but the Credit of their Ca&s;h ends, if ever they baulk but one Bill.</P>
<P>To ask the World to &s;tay for their Money and take Intere&s;t, is to weaken the Credit of their Ca&s;h, and transfer them&s;elves to the Credit of their Stock which no body doubts to be good.</P>
<P>I know therefore nothing the Bank could have done more to injure the Credit of their running Ca&s;h, than to make &s;uch a Propo&s;al of Intere&s;t upon thair Bills, which formerly they publickly refu&s;ed.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="15" MS="Y">
I que&s;tion not but the Bank will out live the De&s;ign of all the Sir <HI>C&mdash;s.</HI> and Sir <HI>L&mdash;s.</HI> in <HI>England;</HI> and if they do an&s;wer all the Demands which now run upon them without &s;topping Pay|ments, their Enemies will receive a particular Mortification: but I am of the Opinion at the &s;ame time, they will be &s;en&s;ible that the offer of doubling the Intere&s;t on their Bills, really ra|ther injur'd them, then an&s;wered the End they propo&s;ed.</P>
<P>From the&s;e particular In&s;tances, I proceed to examine whether the&s;e People who have carry|ed on the&s;e Mea&s;ures, have not an&s;wer'd two De|&s;igns together; and at one Blow attempted to wound their oppo&s;ite Party and the Government al&s;o.</P>
<P>Whoever wounds the publick Credit, wounds the whole Nation and the Government, the gi|ving a blow to the Currency of proper Credit, is robbing the Nation of &s;o much Stock; for Credit is the &s;econd branch of Stock, and Trade mu&s;t decline accordingly; by le&s;&s;ening our Stock and Trade, we are weakned in the main &s;trength of the Kingdom; the Government is weaken'd, Aids and Taxes mu&s;t fall &s;hort, e&s;pecially where Trade is to pay them, and Loans and Anticipia|tions,
<PB N="15" REF="16" MS="Y">
which are Advancements made for the im|mediate Service of the Government, will be &s;topt.</P>
<P>If it be in the power of Mercenary Brokers and Companies to engro&s;s the Current Ca&s;h, &s;o as to make a Scarcity of Money, it mu&s;t con&s;equent|ly be in their Power, whenever they are plea&s;ed to &s;how their Di&s;$e&s;teem to the Government, to prevent the advancement of any Sum of Money for the publick Service.</P>
<P>And this Experiment may be a Tryal of their Skill, to let us &s;ee what they are able to do, if the City does not take Care to oblige them by choo&s;ing Magi&s;trates or Repre&s;entatives to their Mind or out of their Party.</P>
<P>'Tis very hard, that this &s;ort of Men by the Power of their Money, and the Influence they have in the Stocks of Companies, &s;hould have it in their Hands to put a general &s;top to Credit, Ca&s;h, Banks, and even the Exchequer it &s;elf.</P>
<P>'Tis known, their Affection to the Government, and &s;ome Intere&s;t of the King and Kingdom, is but very indifferent, and that generally &s;peaking, both tho&s;e two great Men we have mention'd, and almo&s;t the whole Party, who e&s;pou&s;e the Old Companies Quarrel, have put them&s;elves in a direct Oppo&s;ition to the Friends of the Govern|ment, and always run retrograde to the King and the Nations Intere&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="17" MS="Y">
That they have de&s;ign'd ill, is manife&s;t by the Event, becau&s;e they have done what lay in their Power to ruin the Nations Credit, in order to affect the general Trade, as well as the Per&s;ons.</P>
<P>I &s;hall now examine a little the rea&s;on of this Combu&s;tion, and I cannot but reflect that there &s;eems to be &s;everal Cau&s;es to which it may be a&s;&s;ign'd; all of which &s;eem but to expo&s;e the Temper of the People we &s;peak of, and to make both them and their Cau&s;e odious to Mankind.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, <HI>from Ambition</HI> to &s;how the City that they are Per&s;ons whom it is Dangerous to di&s;|oblige, and that they are able to &s;how their Re|&s;entments in a Method which they ought to be affraid of to let them &s;ee that they knew not what they did, when they Poll'd again&s;t Men of &s;uch Power and Influence as they, and that they ought to have a Care of affronting Men, in who&s;e Power it lay &s;o much to check the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential point of the Cities pro&s;perity, <HI>their Trade;</HI> and to let the Government &s;ee too, that they are Men of &s;uch Figures and Authority in the Nation, and can at their Plea&s;ure &s;o manage the Ca&s;h and Trade of the Town, that they can &s;top our Credit, break our Gold&s;miths, &s;ink our Stocks, embarra&s;s the Bank, and ruine Trade at their Will and Plea&s;ure.</P>
<Q><PB N="17" REF="18" MS="Y">
<P>So far as this is a good Rea&s;on, &s;o far with Submi&s;&s;ion the Government is concern'd, to take Care that their Influence and Power be &s;o re&s;train|ed by whol&s;ome Laws, as that the whole Command of the Nations Ca&s;h and Credit may not be in the Hands of Companies and Stock-jobbers.</P></Q>
<P>Another original Cau&s;e of the pre&s;ent Di&s;tur|bance, is the&s;e Men Exerting the Power I have been &s;peaking of by way of Re&s;entment:</P>
<P N="1"><HI>1.</HI> At the Cittizens, in the Slur they thought put upon them by the Livery, for oppo&s;ing their E|lection.</P>
<P N="2"><HI>2.</HI> At the New Company, for Rea&s;ons drawn from the Different Intere&s;ts of both the &s;aid Compa|nies.</P>
<P>I &s;hall not examin here whether the <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Trade be a real prejudice to the General Stock of the Kingdom, but I mu&s;t be excu&s;ed to be po&s;&s;itive in this, That the two Rival Companies are certain|ly a prejudice to the <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Trade.</P>
<P>And I may &s;afely add, That <HI>Jobbing</HI> their Stocks about, rai&s;ing and &s;inking them at the Plea&s;ure of Parties and private Intere&s;ts, is more prejudicial to
<PB N="18" REF="19" MS="Y">
Trade in General, than both the Companies can make amends for.</P>
<P>There is hardly a private Trades-man in the Town, but one way or other feel the effects of the lea&s;t &s;top to the currency of Ca&s;h, and Gold&s;miths Bills; and it &s;eems to be <HI>a Grievance to be puni&s;hed by the Judge,</HI> That the General head of Trade in a City, &s;o dependant upon Trade as this is, &s;hould be liable to the Clande&s;tine Management of Parties, and &s;uffer for the petty Quarrels and Di&s;putes of two <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Companies that have nothing to do with them.</P>
<P>As to the Di&s;putes between the two Compa|nies being prejudicial both to them&s;elves, and to every Body el&s;e; 'tis plain by what has been &s;aid, they are prejudicial to Trade in General, by how much their private Di&s;putes affect the value of other Peoples E&s;tates, rai&s;ing and &s;inking of Stocks, which have no relation to them, and influencing publick Credit.</P>
<P>They are and will be certainly De&s;tructive to the <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Trade in General, by glutting the Nation &s;o with Goods, as to prejudice the Manu|facture of <HI>England,</HI> and di&s;gu&s;t as well as injure the Poor; and by reducing the Prices of their own Goods to out do and under-&s;ell one another; which 'tis hop'd al&s;o may in time reduce them both

to Circum&s;tances more proportioned to the Na|ture of the Trade, and to their own Intere&s;t.</P>
<P>Not that I believe 'twould be be&s;t for <HI>Eng|land</HI> to have no <HI>Ea&s;t&punc;India-Company</HI> neither; many parts of that Trade are certainly beneficial to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Trade in general; but to carry it on to &s;uch a Magnitude as is palpably de&s;tructive to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Manufactures, and Impoveri&s;hing to the Nation by Exporting &s;uch quantities of <HI>Bul|lion</HI> in Specie, mu&s;t certainly make it a Publick nu&s;ance, a burthen to Trade, and a damage to the Nation.</P>
<P>Add to this the &s;trife between them, their Emulation in Sales mu&s;t certainly de&s;troy their own De&s;igns, and ruin them both. For cheap|ne&s;s of any Goods Imported which vye with our Manufacture, mu&s;t be prejudicial to that Manu|facture; and when two of a Trade &s;trive to ruin one another by under-&s;elling, it generally ruins the Trade, and both Parties too.</P>
<P>So that from the Contention between the&s;e two Companies, Trade in General is Injur'd, our Manufactures di&s;couraged, both Companies will in the end be ruin'd, and the <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Trade &s;poil'd if not lo&s;t.</P>
<P>For it does not follow, That becau&s;e Eight or Ten Ships a Year from <HI>India,</HI> may be a nece&s;&s;ary and
<PB N="20" REF="21" MS="Y">
profitable Trade; That therefore Twenty or Thirty mu&s;t be &s;o too; and 'tis ea&s;ie to demon&s;trate, That whereas we may want Eight or Ten Ships a Year in that Trade, Twenty or Thirty would ruin the Trade it &s;elf, and be a General prejudice to the Nation.</P>
<P>Trade is in no re&s;pect tollerable, but as 'tis Profitable; and the profit con&s;i&s;ts, or at lea&s;t de|pends upon proportion of Circum&s;tances; if the Import exceeds the Demand, Goods mu&s;t fall, and if the Goods fall, the Profit &s;inks.</P>
<P>The Companies cannot expect, e&s;pecially now their Silk-Trade is limited (as by Act of Parlia|ment it is) That this Trade can vent the Import of about Sixty Sail of Ships now abroad; if they come to under-&s;elling one another, they are gone, and their Stock is not worth 20 <HI>per Cent.</HI> from the fir&s;t Day they begin it.</P>
<P>In the mean Time, if they do find a vent for &s;o great a quanity of Goods as all tho&s;e Ships mu&s;t Import, the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Manufacture mu&s;t &s;uffer.</P>
<P>On the whole matter,</P>
<P>Whether we con&s;ider the injury to the Publick Credit by the villany of Stock-Jobbers,</P>

The expo&s;ing the E&s;&s;entials of the Nations, Pro&s;periry, to the Management of mercenary Brokers and Parties; who upon every occa&s;ion they are plea&s;ed to take, when &s;uch as they think fit to approve of, are not cho&s;en Lord Mayors or Parliament-Men, &s;hall take the Liberty to &s;hew their Re&s;entments by Affronting the Go|vernment, ruining Banks and Gold&s;miths, and &s;inking the Stocks of all the Companies in Town:</P>
<P>Or, the Powerful influence they have by their Money on the current Ca&s;h of the Nation.</P>
<P>Whether any of the&s;e things are con&s;idered, I leave it to the Wi&s;e Heads of the Nation, now concerned to reflect and examine, whether it be con&s;i&s;tent with the Safety of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nation, with the Honour of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Government, or with the Nature of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Trade, to &s;uffer &s;uch a &s;ort of People to go on unpre&s;crib'd and unlimited, or indeed unpuni&s;h'd.</P>
<P>What &s;afety can we have at home, while our Peace is at the mercy of &s;uch Men, and 'tis in their Power to <HI>Jobb</HI> the Nation into Feuds among our &s;elves, and to declare a new &s;ort of Civil War among us when they plea&s;e?</P>

<P>What will become of the Honour of the Eng|li&s;h Nation, if the principal Affairs relating to the Credit both of the publick and private Funds is de|pendant upon &s;uch vile People, who care not who they ruin, nor who they advance, tho one be the Nation's Friends, and the other its Enemies, and ex|pos'd to their particular Re&s;entments?</P>

<P>For an&s;wer, I might &s;ay 'tis not always to be expected that he which finds a Fault &s;hou'd mend it: If an Enemy have laid an Ambu&s;cade to &s;ur|pri&s;e a Town, he who fir&s;t Di&s;covers it is as in&s;tru|mental to &s;ave the Place as he who defends the Works; and the Wi&s;dom of the Parliament, their pre&s;ent Se&s;&s;ion being upon us, together with the con&s;equence of the thing it &s;elf, methinks might turn the Eyes of all Men from a &s;ingle Per&s;on to that great A&s;&s;embly, and expect the Remedy where the Power of redre&s;s more particularly is lodg'd.</P>
<P>But that I may al&s;o let the Reader know that this Di&s;ea&s;e is not incurable, nor the men unpuni&s;hable, I will lay down a few Generals, which if put into execution by the Authority of Parliament, may be effectual to &s;uppre&s;s &s;uch People as we complain
