<P>THIS year the &s;udden death of Henry,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1612.</NOTE> Prince of
Wales,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Novem. 6. Death of Pr. Henry.</NOTE> diffu&s;ed an univer&s;al grief thro' the na|tion.
Tho' youth and royal birth, both of them
&s;trong allurements, prepo&s;&s;e&s;s men mightily in favour of the
early age of all princes; 'tis with peculiar fondne&s;s, that
hi&s;torians mention Henry: And, in every re&s;pect, his merit
&s;eems to have been extraordinary. He had not reached his
eighteenth year, and he po&s;&s;essed already more dignity in his
behaviour, and commanded more re&s;pect, than his father,
with all his age, learning, and experience. Neither his high
fortune, nor his youth, had &s;educed him into any irregular
plea&s;ures: Bu&s;ine&s;s and ambition &s;eem to have been his &s;ole
pa&s;&s;ion. His inclination, as well as exerci&s;es, were intirely
<PB N="2" REF="8">
martial.<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. XLVII.</NOTE> The French amba&s;&s;ador, coming to take leave of
him, and ask his commands for France, found him employed
in the exercise of the pike; <HI>Tell your King,</HI> said he, <HI>in what
occupation you left me ingaged</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">The French monarch had given particular orders to his mini&s;ters to cul|tivate the Prince's friend&s;hip; who must &s;oon, said he, have chief authority in England, where the king and queen are held in so little e&s;timation. See <HI>Dep. de la B$derie.</HI></NOTE>. He had conceived great
affection and e&s;teem for the brave Sir Walter Raleigh. It
was his &s;aying, <HI>Sure no king but my father would keeb &s;uch
a bird in a cage</HI><NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Coke's Detection, p. 37.</NOTE>. He &s;eems, indeed to have nouri&s;hed too
violent a contempt for the King, on account of his pedantry
and pu&s;illanimity; and by that means struck in with the
re&s;tle&s;s and martial &s;pirit of the English nation. Had he
lived, he had probably promoted the glory, perhaps not the
felicity, of his people. The unhappy prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, which
men commonly entertain in favour of ambition, courage,
enterprize, and other warlike virtues, ingages generous natures,
who always love fame, into &s;uch pur&s;uits as de&s;troy
their own peace, and that of the re&s;t of mankind.</P>
<P>VIOLENT reports were propagated, as if Henry had
been carried off by poi&s;on; but the phy&s;icians, on opening
his body, found no &s;ymptoms to confirm such an opinion<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Kennet, p. 690. Coke, p. 37. Welwood, p. 272.</NOTE>.
The bold and criminal malignity of mens tongues and pens
&s;pared not even the King on that occa&s;ion. But that prince's
character &s;eems to have failed rather in the extreme of facility
and humanity, than in that of cruelty and violence.
His indulgence to Henry was great, and perhaps imprudent,
by giving him a very large and independent &s;ettlement, even
in &s;o early youth.</P>
<P>THE marriage of the Prince&s;s Elizabeth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1613.</NOTE> with Frederic
the Elector Palatine, was fini&s;hed &s;ome time after the death
of the Prince, and &s;erved to di&s;&s;ipate the grief which aro&s;e
on that melancholy event.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Febr. 14.</NOTE> But this marriage, tho' cele|brated
<PB N="3" REF="9">
with great joy and fe&s;tivity, proved, it&s;elf, a very
unhappy event to the King, as well as to his &s;on-in-law, and
had ill con&s;equences on the reputation and fortunes of both.
The Elector,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Marriage of the Princess Elizabeth with the Palatine.</NOTE> tru&s;ting to &s;o great an alliance, engaged in
enterprizes beyond his &s;trength: And the King, not being
able to &s;upport him in his di&s;tre&s;s, lo&s;t intirely, in the end
of his life, what remained of the affections and e&s;teem of
his own &s;ubjects.</P>
<P>EXCEPT during &s;e&s;&s;ions of parliament,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ri&s;e of So|mer&s;et.</NOTE> the hi&s;tory of
this reign may more properly be called the hi&s;tory of the
court than that of the nation. A mo&s;t intere&s;ting object
had, for &s;ome years, ingaged the attention of the court:
It was a favourite, and one beloved by James with &s;o pro|fu&s;e
and unlimited an affection, as left no room for any rival
or competitor. About the end of the year 1609, Robert
Carre, a youth of twenty years of age, and of a good fa|mily
in Scotland, arrived in London, after having pa&s;&s;ed
&s;ome time in his travels. All his natural accompli&s;hments
con&s;i&s;ted in good looks: All his acquired abilities, in an
ea&s;y air and graceful demeanour. He had letters of recom|mendation
to his countryman lord Hay; and that Nobleman
no &s;ooner ca&s;t-his eye upon him, than he di&s;covered talents
&s;ufficient to entitle him immediately to make a great figure
in the government. Apprized of the King's pa&s;&s;ion for
youth and beauty, and exterior appearance, he &s;tudied
how matters might be &s;o adju&s;ted, that this new object should
make the &s;tronge&s;t impre&s;&s;ion upon him. Without men|tioning
him at court, he a&s;&s;igned him the office, at a match
of tilting, of pre&s;enting to the King his buckler and de|vice;
and hoped that he would attract the attention of that
monarch. Fortune proved favourable to his de&s;ign, by an
incident, which bore, at fir&s;t, a contrary a&s;pect. When
Carre was advancing to execute his office, his unruly hor&s;e
flung him, and broke his leg in the King's pre&s;ence. James
approached him with pity and concern: Love and affection
aro&s;e on the &s;ight of his beauty and tender years; and the
<PB N="4" REF="10">
Prince ordered him immediately to be lodged in the palace,
and to be carefully attended. He him&s;elf, after the tilting,
paid him a vi&s;it in his chamber, and returned frequently
during his con&s;inement. The ignorance and &s;implicity of
the boy fini&s;hed the conque&s;t, begun by his exterior graces
and accompli&s;hments. Other princes have been fond of
chu&s;ing their favourites from among the lower ranks of
their &s;ubjects, and have repo&s;ed them&s;elves on them with
the more unre&s;erved confidence and affection, that the ob|ject
has been beholden to their bounty for every honour and
acqui&s;ition: James was de&s;irous that his favourite &s;hould
al&s;o derive from him all his &s;en&s;e, experience, and knowlege.
Highly conceited of his own wi&s;dom, he plea&s;ed him&s;elf
with the fancy that this raw youth, by his le&s;&s;ons and in|&s;tructions,
would, in a little time, be equal to his &s;age&s;t+mini&s;ters,
and be initiated into all the profound my&s;teries of
government, on which he &s;et &s;o high a value. And as this
kind of creation was more perfectly. his own work than any
other, he &s;eems to have indulged an unlimited fondne&s;s for
his minion, beyond even that which be bore to his own
children. He &s;oon knighted him, created him Vi&s;count Ro|che&s;ter,
gave him the garter, brought him into the privy|council,
and, tho' at fir&s;t without a&s;&s;igning him any parti|cular
office, be&s;towed on him the &s;upreme direction. of all
his bu&s;ine&s;s and political concerns, Agreeable to this rapid
advancement in confidence and honour, were the riches
heaped upon the needy favourite; and while Sali&s;bury and
all the wi&s;e&s;t mini&s;ters could &s;carce find expedients &s;ufficient
to keep in motion the o'erburthened machine of govern|ment,
James, with un&s;paring hand, loaded with trea&s;ures
this in&s;ignificant and u&s;ele&s;s pageant<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Kennet, p. 635, 636, &amp;c.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IT is &s;aid, that the King found his pupil &s;o ill educated,
as to be ignorant even of the lowe&s;t rudiments of the Latin
tongue; and that the monarch, laying a&s;ide the &s;ceptre,
<PB N="5" REF="11">
took the birch into his royal hand, and in&s;ructed him in
the principles of grammar. During the intervals of this
noble occupation, affairs of &s;tate would be introduced; and
the &s;tripling, by the a&s;cendant which he had acquired,
was now enabled to repay in political, what he had received in
grammatical in&s;truction. Such &s;cenes, and &s;uch incidents,
are the more ridiculous, tho' the le&s;s odious, that the pa&s;|&s;ion
of James &s;eems not to have contained in it any thing
criminal or flagitious. Hi&s;tory charges her&s;elf willingly
with a relation of the great crimes, or the great virtues of
mankind; but &s;he appears to fall from her dignity, when
nece&s;&s;itated to dwell on &s;uch frivolous events and ignoble
per&s;onages.</P>
<P>THE favourite was not, at fir&s;t, &s;o intoxicated with ad|vancement,
as not to be &s;en&s;ible of his own ignorance and
inexperience. He had recour&s;e to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance and advice
of a friend; and he was more fortunate in his choice, than
is u&s;ual with &s;uch pampered minions. In Sir Thomas Overbury
he met with a judicious and &s;incere coun&s;ellor, who,
building all hopes of his own preferment on that of the
young favourite, endeavoured to in&s;til into him the princi|ples
of prudence and di&s;cretion. By zealously &s;erving every|body,
Carre was taught to abate the envy, which might at|tend
his &s;udden elevation: By $hewing a preference for the
Engli&s;h, he learned to e&s;cape the prejudices which prevailed
again&s;t his country. And &s;o long as he was contented to be
ruled by Overbury's friendly coun&s;els, he enjoyed, what is
rare, the highe&s;t favour of the prince, without being hated
by the people.</P>
<P>To complete the mea&s;ure of courtly happine&s;s, nought
was wanting but a kind mi&s;tre&s;s; and, where high fortune
concurred with all the graces of youth and beauty, this cir|cum&s;tance
could not be difficult to attain. But it was here
that the favourite met with that rock, on which all his for|tunes
were wrecked, and which plunged him for ever into
an aby&s;s of infamy, guilt, and mi&s;ery.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="12">
NO &s;ooner had James mounted the throne of England,
than he remembered his friend&s;hip for the unfortunate fami|lies
of Howard and Devereux, who had &s;uffered for their
attachment to the cau&s;e of Mary and to his own. Having
re&s;tored young E&s;&s;ex to his blood and dignity, and conferred
the titles of Suffolk and Northampton on two brothers of
the hou&s;e of Norfolk, he &s;ought the farther plea&s;ure of
uniting the&s;e families by the marriage of the Earl of E&s;&s;ex
with Lady Frances Howard, daughter to the Earl of Suf|folk.
She was only thirteen, he fourteen years of age;
and it was thought proper, till both &s;hould attain the age
of puberty, that he &s;hould go abroad, and pa&s;s &s;ome time
in his travels<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Kennet, p. 686.</NOTE>. He returned into England after four
years ab&s;ence, and was plea&s;ed to find his Counte&s;s in the
full lu&s;tre of beauty, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the love and admi|ration
of the whole court. But, when the Earl approached,
and claimed the privileges of a hu&s;band, he met with no|thing
but &s;ymptoms of aver&s;ion and di&s;gu&s;t, and a flat re|fu&s;al
of any farther familiarities. He applied to her pa|rents,
who con&s;trained her to attend him into the country,
and to partake of his bed: But nothing could overcome
her rigid &s;ullenne&s;s and ob&s;tinacy; and &s;he &s;till ro&s;e from
his &s;ide, without having &s;hared the nuptial plea&s;ures. Di&s;|gu&s;ted
with re-iterated denials, he at la&s;t gave over the
pur&s;uit, and &s;eparating him&s;elf from her, thenceforth aban|doned
her conduct to her own will and di&s;cretion.</P>
<P>SUCH coldne&s;s and aver&s;ion in Lady Effex aro&s;e not with|out
an attachment to another object. The favourite had
opened his adre&s;&s;es, and had been too &s;ucce&s;sful in making
impre&s;&s;ion on the tender heart of the young Counte&s;s<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Kennet, p. 687.</NOTE>.
She imagined, that &s;o long as &s;he refu&s;ed the embraces of
E&s;&s;ex, &s;he never could be deemed his wife, and that a &s;e|paration
and divorce might &s;till open the way for a new
marriage with her beloved Roche&s;ter<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">State Trials, vol. i. p. 228.</NOTE>. Though their
<PB N="7" REF="13">
pa&s;&s;ion was &s;o violent, and their opportunities of intercour&s;e
&s;o frequent, that they had already indulged them&s;elves in all
the gratifications of love, they &s;till lamented their unhappy
fate, while the union between them was not intire and in|di&s;&s;oluble.
And the lover, as well as his mi&s;tre&s;s, was im|patient,
till their mutual ardour &s;hould be crowned with
marriage.</P>
<P>So momentous an affair could not be concluded without
con&s;ulting Overbury, with whom Roche&s;ter was accu&s;tomed
to &s;hare all his &s;ecrets. While that faithful friend had con|&s;idered
his patron's attachment to the Counte&s;s of E&s;&s;ex
merely as an affair of gallantry, he had favoured its progre&s;s;
and it was partly owing to the ingenious and pa&s;&s;ionate let|ters
which he dictated, that Roche&s;ter had met with &s;uch
&s;ucce&s;s in his addre&s;&s;es. Like an experienced courtier, he
thought that a conque&s;t of this nature would throw a lu&s;tre
on the youthful favourite, and would tend &s;till further to
endear him to James, who was charmed to hear of the
amours of his court, and li&s;tened with attention to every
tale of gallantry. But great was Overbury's alarm, when
Roche&s;ter mentioned his de&s;ign of marrying the Counte&s;s;
and he u&s;ed every method to di&s;&s;uade his friend from &s;o
fooli&s;h an attempt. He repr&s;ented, how invidious, how
difficult an enterprize it was to procure her a divorce from
her hu&s;band: How dangerous, how &s;hameful, to take into
his own bed a profligate woman, who, being married to a
young nobleman of the fir&s;t rank, had not &s;crupled to pro|&s;titute
her character, and to be&s;tow favours on the object
of a capricious and momentary pa&s;&s;ion. And, in the zeal of
friend&s;hip, he went &s;o far as to threaten Roche&s;ter, that he
would &s;eparate him&s;elf for ever from him, if he could &s;o far
forget his honour and his intere&s;t as to pro&s;ecute the intended
marriage<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">State Trials, vol. i. p, 235, 236, 252. Franklyn, p. 14.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="14">
ROCHESTER had the weakne&s;s to reveal this conver&s;ation
to the Counte&s;s of E&s;&s;ex;<NOTE PLACE="marg">April 21st.</NOTE> and when her rage and fury broke
out again&s;t Overbury, he had al&s;o the weakne&s;s to enter into
her vindictive projects, and to &s;wear vengeance again&s;t his
friend, for the utmo&s;t in&s;tance, which he could receive, of
his faithful friend&s;hip. Some contrivance was nece&s;&s;ary for
the execution of their purpo&s;e. Roche&s;ter addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf
to the King; and after complaining, that his own in|dulgence
to Overbury had begot in him a degree of arro|gance,
which was extremely di&s;agreeable, he procured a
commi&s;&s;ion for his emba&s;&s;y to Ru&s;&s;ia; which he repre&s;ented
as a retreat for his friend, both profitable and honourable.
When con&s;ulted by Overbury, he earne&s;tly di&s;&s;uaded him
from accepting this offer, and took on him&s;elf the talk of
&s;atisfying the King, if he &s;hould be any way di&s;plea&s;ed with
the refu&s;al<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">State Trials, vol. i. p. 236, 237, &amp;c.</NOTE>.
To the King again, he aggravated the in|&s;olence
of Overbury's conduct, and obtained a warrant for
committing him to the Tower, which James intended as a
&s;light puni&s;hment for his di&s;obedience. The lieutenant of
the Tower was a creature of Roche&s;ter's, and had lately
been put into the office for this very purpo&s;e: He confined
Overbury &s;o &s;trictly, that the unhappy pri&s;oner was debarred
from the &s;ight even of his neare&s;t relations; and no com|munication
of any kind was allowed with him, during near
&s;ix months, which he lived in pri&s;on.</P>
<P>THIS ob&s;tacle being removed, the lovers pur&s;ued their
purpo&s;e; and the King him&s;elf, forgetting the dignity of his
character, and his friend&s;hip for the family of E&s;&s;ex, enter|ed
zealou&s;ly into the project of procuring the Counte&s;s a di|vorce
from her hu&s;band. E&s;&s;ex al&s;o embraced the oppor|tunity
of &s;eparating him&s;elf from a bad woman, by whom
he was hated; and he was willing to favour their &s;ucce&s;s by
any honourable expedient. The pretence for a divorce was
his incapacity to fulfil the conjugal duties; and he con|fe&s;&s;ed,
that, with regard to the Counte&s;s, he was con&s;cious of
<PB N="9" REF="15">
&s;uch an infirmity, tho' he was not &s;en&s;ible of it with regard
to any other woman. In her place too, it is &s;aid, a young
virgin was &s;ub&s;tituted under a mask, to undergo the legal
in&s;pection by a jury of matrons. After &s;uch a trial, &s;econd|ed
by court-influence, and &s;upported by the ridiculous opi|nion

great a novice in this dete&s;table art, that, during the cour&s;e
of five months, a man, who was his pri&s;oner, and attended
by none but his emi&s;&s;aries, could not be di&s;patched but in &s;o
bungling a manner; how could it be imagined, that a young
prince, living in his own court, &s;urrounded by his own
friends and dome&s;tics, could be expo&s;ed to Somet&s;et's at|tempts,
and be taken off by &s;o &s;ubtile a poi&s;on, if &s;uch a

by Sali&s;bury, was &s;old; and two hundred patents of

their predece&s;&s;ors, who, as the Earl of Sali&s;bury &s;aid to the

It appears, however, that Sali&s;bury was &s;omewhat mi&s;taken in this fact: And if the Kings were not oftener refu&s;ed &s;upply by the Parlia|ment, it was only becau&s;e they would not often expo&s;e them&s;elves to the ha|zard of being refu&s;ed: But it is certain that Engli&s;h Parliaments did antiently carry their frugality to an extreme, and &s;eldom could be prevailed upon to give the nece&s;&s;ary &s;upport to the government.</NOTE>; they needed not dread, that the crown
<PB N="11" REF="17">
&s;hould ever intere&s;t it&s;elf in their elections. Formerly, the
Kings even in&s;i&s;ted, that none of their hou&s;hold &s;hould
ever be elected members; and, tho' the charter was after|ward
declared void, Henry VI. from his great favour to
the city of York, conferred a peculiar privilege on its citizens,
that they &s;hould be exempted from this trouble<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Coke's In&s;titutes, part 4. chap. 1, of charters of exemption.</NOTE>. 'Tis well
known, that, in antient times, a &s;eat in the hou&s;e being con|&s;idered
as a burthen, attended neither with honour nor pro|fit,
it was requi&s;ite for the counties and boroughs to pay
fees to their repre&s;entatives. About this time, a &s;eat began
to be regarded as an honour, and the country-gentlemen con|tended
for it; tho' the practice of levying wages for the
parliament-men was not altogether di&s;continued. It was
not till long afterwards, when liberty was thoroughly e&s;ta|bli&s;hed,
and popular a&s;&s;emblies entered into every branch
of public bu&s;ine&s;s, that the members began to join profit to
honour, and the crown found it nece&s;&s;ary to di&s;tribute
among them all the con&s;iderable offices of the kingdom.</P>
<P>So little &s;kill or &s;o &s;mall means had the courtiers, in James's

they immediately re&s;umed the &s;ubjct which had been
broached la&s;t parliament, and di&s;puted his Maje&s;ty's power
of levying new cu&s;toms and impo&s;itions, by the mere au|thority
of his prerogative. 'Tis remarkable, that, in their
debates on this &s;ubject the courtiers frequently pleaded, as
a precedent, the example, of all the other hereditary mo|narchs
in Europe, and mentioned particularly the kings of
France and Spain: nor was this rea&s;oning received by the
hou&s;e, either with &s;urprize or indignation<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Ibid. 21 May 1614.</NOTE>. The mem|bers
<PB N="12" REF="18">
of the oppo&s;ite party, either contented them&s;elves with
denying the ju&s;tne&s;s of the inference, or they di&s;puted the
truth of the ob&s;ervation<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Journ. 12, 21 May 1614.</NOTE>. And a patriot member in par|ticular,
Sir Roger Owen, even in arguing again&s;t the impo|&s;itions,
very frankly allowed, that the king of England was
endued with as ample power and prerogative as any prince in
Chri&s;tendom<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Journ. 18 April 1614.</NOTE>. The nations on the continent, we may ob|&s;erve,
enjoyed &s;till, in that age, &s;ome &s;mall remains of li|berty;

<P>THE commons applied to the lords for a conference with
reward to the new impo&s;itions.<NOTE PLACE="marg">6th of June.</NOTE> A &s;peech of Neile, bi&s;hop

<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Parl. Hi&s;t. vol. v. p. 290. So little fixed at this time were the rules of parliament, that the Commons complained to the Peers of a &s;peech made in the Upper Hou&s;e by the bi&s;hop of Lincoln, which it belonged only to that hou&s;e to cen|&s;ure, and which the other could not regularly be &s;uppo&s;ed to he acquainted with. The&s;e at lea&s;t are the rules e&s;tabli&s;hed &s;ince the Parliament became a real &s;eat of power, and &s;cene of bu&s;ne&s;s. Neither the King mu&s;t take no|tice of what pa&s;&s;es in either hou&s;e, nor either hou&s;e of what pa&s;&s;es in the other, till regularly informed of it. The Commons, in their famous prote&s;ta|tion 1621, fixed this rule with regard to the King, tho' at pre&s;ent they would not bind them&s;elves by it. But as liberty was yet new, the&s;e maxims, which guard and regulate it, were unknown and unpracti&s;ed.</NOTE>; and the King &s;eized the opportunity of di&s;&s;olving
immediately, with great indignation, a parliament, which
had &s;hown &s;o firm a re&s;olution of retrenching his prerogative,
without communicating, in return, the &s;malle&s;t &s;upply to his
nece&s;&s;ities. He carried his re&s;entment &s;o far as even to throw
into pri&s;on &s;ome of the members, who had been the mo&s;t for|ward
in their oppo&s;ition to his mea&s;ures<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Kennet p. 696.</NOTE>. In vain did
he plead, in excu&s;e for this violence, the example of Eli|zabeth
and other princes of the line of Tudor. The peo|ple
and the parliament, without abandoning for ever all their
liberties and privileges, could acquie&s;ce in none of the&s;e pre|cedents,
however frequent. And were the authority of &s;uch
precedents admitted, the utmo&s;t, that could be inferred is,
<PB N="13" REF="19">
that the con&s;tiution of England was, at that time, an in|con&s;i&s;tent
fabrick, who&s;e jarring and di&s;cordant parts mu&s;t
&s;oon de&s;troy each other, and from the di&s;&s;olution of the old,
beget &s;ome new form of civil government, more uniform and
con&s;i&s;tent.</P>
<P>IN the public and avowed conduct of the King and the
hou&s;e of commons, throughout this whole reign, there ap|pears
&s;ufficient cau&s;e of quarrel and di&s;gu&s;t; yet we are not
to imagine, that this was the &s;ole foundation of that jealou&s;y,
which prevailed between them. During debates in the
hou&s;e, it often happened that a particular member, more
ardent and zealous than the re&s;t, would di&s;play the highe&s;t
&s;entiments of liberty, which the commons contented them|&s;elves
to hear with &s;ilence and &s;eeming approbation; and the
King, informed of the&s;e harangues, concluded the whole
hou&s;e to be infected with the &s;ame principles, and to be en|gaged
in a combination again&s;t his prerogative. The King,
on the other hand, tho' he valued him&s;elf extremely on his
king-craft, and was not altogether incapable of di&s;&s;imulation,
&s;eems to have been very little endued with the gift of &s;ecrecy;
but openly, at his table, in all companies, inculcated tho&s;e
monarchical tenets, which he had &s;o &s;trongly imbibed. Be|fore
a numerous audience, he had expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf with
great di&s;paragement of the common law of England, and
had given the preference, in the &s;tronge&s;t terms, to the ci|vil
law: And for this indi&s;cretion he found him&s;elf obliged to
apologize, in a &s;peech to the former parliament<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">K. James's&punc; Works, p. $32.</NOTE>. As a
&s;pecimen of his u&s;ual liberty of talk, we may mention a
&s;tory, tho' it pa&s;&s;ed &s;ome time a afterwards, which we meet with
in the life of Waller, and which that poet u&s;ed frequently to
repeat. When Waller was young, he had the curio&s;ity to
go to court; and he &s;tood in the circle, and &s;aw James dine;
where, among other company, there &s;at at table two bi&s;hops,
Neile and Andrews. The King propo&s;ed aloud this que&s;tion,
<PB N="14" REF="20">
Whether he might not take his &s;ubjects money, when he
needed it, without all, this formality of parliament? Neile re|plied,
<HI>God forbid you &s;hould not: For you are the breath of
our no&s;trils.</HI> Andrews declined an&s;wering, and &s;aid, he
was not &s;killed in parliamentary ca&s;es: But upon the King's
urging him, and &s;aying he would admit of no eva&s;ion, the
bi&s;hop replied very plea&s;antly: <HI>Why then I think your Ma|je&s;ty
may very lawfully take my brother Neile's money: For
he offers it</HI><NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Preface to Waller's Works.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE favourite had hitherto e&s;caped the inquiry of ju&s;tice;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1615.</NOTE>
but he had not e&s;caped that &s;till voice, which can make it&s;elf
be heard amid&s;t all the hurry and flattery of a court,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Somer&s;et's fall.</NOTE>
and a&s;toni&s;hes the criminal with a ju&s;t repre&s;entation of his
mo&s;t &s;ecret enormities. Con&s;cious of the murder of his
friend, Somer&s;et received &s;mall con&s;olation from the enjoy|ments
of love, or the utmo&s;t kindne&s;s and indulgence of his
&s;overeign. The graces of his youth gradually di&s;appeared,
the gaiety of his manners was ob&s;cured, his politene&s;s and
obliging behaviour were changed into &s;ullenne&s;s and &s;ilence.
And the King, who&s;e affections had been engaged by the&s;e
&s;uperficial accompli&s;hments, began to e&s;trange him&s;elf from
a man, who no longer contributed to his amu&s;ement.</P>
<P>THE &s;agacious courtiers ob&s;erved the fir&s;t &s;ymptoms of
this di&s;gu&s;t: Somer&s;et's enemies &s;eized the opportunity, and
offered a new minion to the King. George Villiers, a youth
of one-and-twenty, younger brother of a good family, re|turned
at this time from his travels, and was remarked for
the advantages of a hand&s;ome per&s;on, genteel air, and fa|&s;hionable
apparel. At a comedy, he was purpo&s;ely placed
full in James's eye, and immediately engaged the attention,
and, in the &s;ame in&s;tant, the affections of that monarch<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Franklyn, p. 30. Kennet, vol. ii. p. 693.</NOTE>.
A&s;hamed of his &s;udden attachment, the King endeavoured,
<PB N="15" REF="21">
but in vain, to conceal the partiality which he felt for the
handsome &s;tranger; and he employed all his profound poli|tics
to fix him in his &s;ervice, without &s;eeming to de&s;ine it.
He declared his re&s;olution not to confer any office on him,
unle&s;s entreated by the Queen; and he pretended, that it
&s;hould only be in complai&s;ance to her choice, he would agree
to admit him near his per&s;on. The Queen was immediately
applied to; but &s;he, well knowing the extreme to which
the King carried the&s;e attachments, refu&s;ed; at fir&s;t, to lend
her countenance to this new pa&s;&s;ion. It was not till en|treated
by Abbot, Archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, a decent pre|late,
and one much prejudiced again&s;t Somer&s;et, that &s;he
would conde&s;cend to oblige her hu&s;band, by a&s;king this fa|vour
of him<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Coke, p. 46, 47. Ru&s;h vol. i. p. 456.</NOTE>. And the King, thinking now that all ap|pearances
were fully &s;aved, no longer con&s;trained his affec|tion,
but immediately be&s;towed the office of cup-bearer on
young Villiers.</P>
<P>THE whole court were thrown into parties between the two
minions; while &s;ome endeavoured to advance the ri&s;ing
fortunes of Villiers, and others deemed it &s;afer to adhere to
the e&s;tabli&s;hed credit of Somer&s;et. The king him&s;elf, di|vided
between inclination and decorum, increa&s;ed the doubt
and ambiguity of the courtiers; and the &s;tern jealou&s;y of
the old favourite, who refu&s;ed every advance of friend&s;hip
from his rival, begot perpetual quarrels between their &s;eve|ral
partizans. But the di&s;covery of Somer&s;et's guilt in the
murder of Overbury, at la&s;t decided the controver&s;y, and
expo&s;ed him to the ruin and infamy which he &s;o well me|rited.</P>
<P>AN apothecary's 'prentice, who had been employed in
making up the poi&s;ons, having retired to Flu&s;hing, began
to talk very freely of the whole &s;ecret; and the affair at
last came to the ears of Trumbal, the King's envoy in the
Low Countries. By his means, Sir Ralph Winwood, &s;ecre|tary
<PB N="16" REF="22">
of &s;tate, was informed; and he carried the intelligence
immediately to James. The King, alarmed and a&s;toni&s;hed
to find &s;uch enormous guilt in a man whom he had admitted
into his bo&s;om, &s;ent for Sir Edward Coke, lord chief ju&s;|tice,
and earne&s;tly recommended to him the mo&s;t rigorous
and unbya&s;&s;ed &s;crutiny. This injunction was executed with
great indu&s;try and &s;everity: The whole labyrinth of guilt
was carefully unravelled: The le&s;&s;er criminals, Sir Jervis
Elvis, lieutenant of the Tower, Franklin, We&s;ton, Mrs.
Turner, were fir&s;t tried and condemned: Somer&s;et and his
Counte&s;s were afterwards found guilty: Northampton's
death, a little before, had &s;aved him from a like fate.</P>
<P>IT may not be unworthy of remark, that Coke, in the
trial of Mrs. Turner, told her, that &s;he was guilty of the
&s;even deadly &s;ins: She was a whore, a bawd, a &s;orcerer, a
witch, a papi&s;t, a felon, and a murderer<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">State Trials, vol. i. p. 230.</NOTE>. And what
may more &s;urprize us, Bacon, then attorney-general, took
care to ob&s;erve, that poi&s;oning was a popi&s;h trick<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Ibid. vol. i. p. 242.</NOTE>. Such
were the bigotted prejudices which prevailed in this age:
Poi&s;oning was not, of it&s;elf, &s;ufficiently odious, if it was not
repre&s;ented as a branch of popery. Stowe tells us, that,
when the King came to Newca&s;tle, on his fir&s;t entry into
England, he gave liberty to all the pri&s;oners, except tho&s;e
confined for trea&s;on, murder, and papi&s;try. When one
con&s;iders the&s;e circum&s;tances, that furious bigotry of the
catholics, which broke out in the gunpowder con&s;piracy,
appears the le&s;s &s;urprising.</P>
<P>ALL the accomplices in Overbury's murder received the
puni&s;hment due to their crime: But the King be&s;towed a
pardon on the principals, Somer&s;et and the Counte&s;s. It
mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, that James's fortitude had been highly
laudable, had he per&s;i&s;ted in his fir&s;t intention of con&s;igning
over to &s;evere ju&s;tice all the criminals: But let us &s;till be|ware
of blaming him too har&s;hly, if, on the approach of
<PB N="17" REF="23">
the fatal hour, he &s;crupled to deliver into hands of the
executioner, per&s;ons whom he had once favoured with his
mo&s;t tender affections. To &s;often the rigour of their fate,
after &s;ome years impri&s;onment, he re&s;tored them to their
liberty, and conferred on them a pen&s;ion, with which they
retired; and langui&s;hed out old age in infamy and ob&s;curity.
Their guilty loves were turned into the mo&s;t deadly hatred;
and they pa&s;&s;ed many years together in the &s;ame hou&s;e,
without any intercour&s;e or corre&s;pondence with each
other<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Kennet, p. 699.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>SEVERAL hi&s;torians<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Coke, Walden, &amp;c.</NOTE>, in relating the&s;e events, have in|fi&s;ted
much on the di&s;&s;imulation of James's behaviour, when
he delivered Somer&s;et into the hands of the chief ju&s;tice;
on the in&s;olent menaces of that criminal; on his peremptory
refu&s;al to &s;tand a trial; and on the extreme anxiety of the
King during the whole progre&s;s of this affair. Allowing all
the&s;e circum&s;tances to be true, of which &s;ome are &s;u&s;picious,
if not palpably fal&s;e<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">See Biog. Brit. article Coke, p. 1384.</NOTE>, the great remains of tenderne&s;s,
which James &s;till felt for Somer&s;et, may, perhaps, be &s;uffi|cient
to account for them. That favourite was high-&s;pirited;
and re&s;olute rather to peri&s;h than live under the infamy to
which he was expo&s;ed. James was &s;en&s;ible that the par|doning
&s;o great a criminal, which was of it&s;elf invidious,
would become &s;till more unpopular, if his ob&s;tinate and
&s;tubborn behaviour on his trial &s;hould augment the public
hatred again&s;t him<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Bacon, vol. iv. p. 617.</NOTE>. At lea&s;t, the urire&s;erved confidence,
in which the, King had indulged his favourite for &s;everal
years, might render Somer&s;et ma&s;ter of &s;o many &s;ecrets, that
it is impo&s;&s;ible, without farther light, to a&s;&s;ign the particu|lar
cau&s;e of that &s;uperiority, which, 'tis &s;aid, he appeared
&s;o much to a&s;&s;ume.</P>
<P>THE fall of Somer&s;et,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ri&s;e of Bucking|ham.</NOTE> and his bani&s;hment from court,
opened the way for Villiers to mount up at once to the full
<PB N="18" REF="24">
height of favour, of honours, and of riches. Had James's
pa&s;&s;ion been governed, by common rules of prudence, the
office of cup-bearer would have attached Villiers to his per|&s;on,
and might well have contented one of his age and fa|mily;
nor would any one, who was not cynically au&s;tere,
have much cen&s;ured the &s;ingularity of the King's ta&s;te in
amn&s;ement. But &s;uch advancement was far inserior to the
fortune which he intended for his favourite. In the cour&s;e
of a few years, he created him Vi&s;count Villiers, Earl,
Marquis, and Duke of Buckingham, knight of the garter,
ma&s;ter of the hor&s;e, chief ju&s;tice in Eyre, warden of the
cinque ports, ma&s;ter of the king's bench office, &s;teward of
We&s;tmin&s;ter, con&s;table of Wind&s;or, and lord high admi|ral
of England<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Franklin, p. 30. Clarendon, 8vo edit. vol. i. p. 10.</NOTE>. His mother obtained the title of Coun|te&s;s
of Buckingham: His brother was created Vi&s;count
Purbeck; and a numerous train of needy relations were
all pu&s;hed up into credit and authority. And thus the
fond Prince, while he meant to play the tutor to his favou|rite,
and to train him up in the rules of prudence and poli|tics,
took an infallible method, by loading him with prema|ture
and exorbitant honours, to render him, for ever, ra&s;h,
precipitant, and in&s;olent.</P>

Dutch; a mea&s;ure which has been &s;everely cen&s;ured by al|mo&s;t
all hi&s;torians; and I may venture to affirm, that tho'
it mu&s;t be owned &s;omewhat impolitic, it has been cen&s;ured
much beyond its real weight and importance.</P>
<P>WHEN Queen Elizabeth advanced money for the &s;upport

<PB N="19" REF="25">
&s;till re&s;erved the pro&s;pect of re-imbur&s;ement;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cautionary towns deli|vered.</NOTE> and &s;he got
con&s;igned into her hands the three important fortre&s;&s;es of
Flu&s;hing, the Brille, and Rammekins, as pledges for the
money which was due to her. Indulgent to the nece&s;&s;itous
condition of the &s;tates, &s;he agreed that the debt &s;hould bear
no intere&s;t; and &s;he &s;tipulated, that, if ever England made
a &s;eperate peace with Spain, &s;he &s;hould pay the troops
which garri&s;oned those &s;ortre&s;&s;es<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Rymer, tom. xvi. p. 341. Winwood, vol. ii. p. 351.</NOTE>. It appears from Jea|nin's
letters, that the &s;tates had expected a very con&s;ider|able
abatement of the debt, even at a time when James's
exchequer was in tolerable order, from the only con&s;iderable
&s;upply which his parliament had ever granted him: much
more were they encouraged in this hope by his pre&s;ent ne|ce&s;&s;itous
condition. In this negotiation they employed Ca|ron,
their mini&s;ter, who offered the King a little above the
third of the money which was due to him, and which
amounted in the whole to 818,408 pounds<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Win|wood, ubi &s;up.</NOTE>. It occurred
to James, that the pay of the garri&s;ons was &s;o burthen&s;ome
on his &s;lender revenue, that very large arrears were owing
them, and they were ready to mutiny for want of &s;ub&s;i&s;t|ence<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Journ. 12 April 1614.</NOTE>;
that, since the King's acce&s;&s;ion, above 300,000
pounds had been expended for their &s;upport, and there ap|peared
no end of the&s;e charges; that by the &s;tricte&s;t com|putation,
the third of the &s;um, paid him pre&s;ently, was much
preferable to the whole payable ten years after<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Money was then at ten per cent.</NOTE>; that the
&s;tates, tru&s;ting to his pacific maxims, as well as the clo&s;e
union of intere&s;t and affection with his people, were no|wi&s;e
anxious for the recovery of the&s;e places, and migh
allow them to lie long in his hands, if full payment was in|&s;i&s;ted
on that this union was really &s;o intimate, that no
rea&s;onable mea&s;ures for mutual &s;upport would be wanting
from the Dutch, even tho' freed from the dependence of
the&s;e garri&s;ons that the exchequer of the republic was at
<PB N="20" REF="26">
pre&s;ent very low,<NOTE PLACE="marg">6th of June.</NOTE> in&s;omuch that they found difficulty, now
that the aids of France were withdrawn, to maintain them|&s;elves
in that po&s;ture of defence, which was requi&s;ite du|ring
the truce with Spain; and that the Spaniards were
perpetually in&s;i&s;ting with the King on the re&s;titution of
the&s;e towns, as belonging to their crown; and no cordial
alliance could ever be made with that nation, while they
remained in the hands of the Engli&s;h<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Ru&s;hworth, vol. i. p. 3.</NOTE>. The&s;e rea&s;ons,
together with his urgent wants, induced the King to accept
of Caron's offer; and he evacuated the cautionary towns,
which held the &s;tates in total &s;ubjection, and which an
ambitious and enterprizing prince would have regarded as
his mo&s;t valuable po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions. This is the date of the full
liberty of the Dutch commonwealth.</P>
<P>WHEN the crown of England devolved on James,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1617.</NOTE> it
might have been fore&s;een by the Scots nation, that the in|dependence
of their kingdom,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Affairs of Scotland.</NOTE> the object for which their ance&s;tors had &s;hed &s;uch an ocean of blood, would now be
utterly lo&s;t;<NOTE PLACE="marg">May.</NOTE> and that, if both &s;tates per&s;evered in main|taining
&s;eparate laws and parliaments, the weaker would
feel more &s;en&s;ibly the &s;ubjection, than if it had been totally
&s;ubdued by force of arms. But the&s;e views did not gene|rally
occur. The glory of having given a &s;overeign to
their powerful enemy, the advantages of pre&s;ent peace and
tranquillity, the riches acquired from the munificence of
their ma&s;ter; the&s;e con&s;iderations &s;ecured, their dutiful obe|dience
to a Prince, who daily gave &s;uch &s;en&s;ible proofs of
his friend&s;hip and partiality towards them. Never had the
authority of any king, who re&s;ided among them, been &s;o
firmly e&s;tabli&s;hed as was that of James, even when ab&s;ent;
and as the admini&s;tration had been hitherto conducted with
great order and tranquility, there had happened no occur|rence
to draw thither our attention. But this &s;ummer, the
King was re&s;olved to pay a vi&s;it to his native country, in
<PB N="21" REF="27">
order to renew his antient friend&s;hips and connexions, and
to introduce that change of eccle&s;ia&s;tical di&s;cipline and go|vernment,
on which his mind was extremely bent. The
three chief points, which the King propo&s;ed to accompli&s;h,
by his journey to Scotland, were the enlarging epi&s;copal
authority, the e&s;tabli&s;hing a few ceremonies in public wor|ship,
and the fixing a &s;uperiority of the civil above the ec|cle&s;ia&s;tical
juri&s;diction.</P>
<P>BUT 'tis an ob&s;ervation, &s;ugge&s;ted by all hi&s;tory, and by
none more than by that of James, and his &s;ucce&s;&s;or, that
the religious &s;pirit, when it mingles with faction, contains
in it &s;omething &s;upernatural and unaccountable; and that,
in its operations upon &s;ociety, effects corre&s;pond le&s;s to their
known cau&s;es than is found in any other circum&s;tance of go|vernment.
A reflection, which may, at once, afford a
&s;ource of blame again&s;t &s;uch &s;overeigns as lightly innovate in
&s;o dangerous an article, and of apology for &s;uch, as being
engaged in an enterprize of that nature, are di&s;appointed
of the expected event, and fail in their undertakings.</P>
<P>WHEN the Scoti&s;h nation were fir&s;t &s;eized with that zeal
for reformation, which, tho' it cau&s;ed &s;uch di&s;turbance du|ring
the time, has &s;ince proved &s;o &s;alutary in the con&s;e|quences;
the preachers, a&s;&s;uming to them&s;elves a character
little inferior to the prophetic or apo&s;tolical, di&s;dained all
&s;ubjection to the &s;piritual rulers of the church, by whom
their innovations were puni&s;hed and oppo&s;ed. The reve|nues
of the dignified clergy, no longer con&s;idered as &s;acred,
were either appropriated by the pre&s;ent po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors, or &s;eized
by the more powerful barons; and what remained, after
mighty dilapidation, was, by act of parliament, annexed to
the crown. The prelates, however, and abbots, maintained
their temporal juri&s;dictions and their &s;eats in parliament; and
tho' laymen were &s;ometimes endowed with eccle&s;ia&s;tical ti|tles,
the church, notwith&s;tanding its frequent prote&s;tations
to the contrary, was &s;till &s;uppo&s;ed to be repre&s;ented by tho&s;e
&s;piritual lords, in the &s;tates of the kingdom. After many
<PB N="22" REF="28">
&s;truggles, the King, even before his acce&s;&s;ion to the throne
of England, had acquired &s;ufficient influence over the Scots
clergy, to extort from them an acknowlegement of the par|liamentary
juri&s;diction of bi&s;hops; though attended with
many precautions, in order to &s;ecure them&s;elves again&s;t the
&s;piritual encroachments of that order<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">1598.</NOTE>. When king of
England, he engaged them, tho' &s;till with great reluctance
on their part, to advance a &s;tep farther, and to receive the
bi&s;hops as perpetual pre&s;idents or moderators in their eccle|&s;ia&s;tical &s;ynods;
re-iterating their prote&s;tations again&s;t all
&s;piritual juri&s;diction of the prelates, and all controuling power
over the pre&s;byters<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">1606.</NOTE>. And by &s;uch gradual innovations,
the King flattered him&s;elf, that he would quietly introduce
epi&s;copal authority: But as his final &s;cope was fully &s;een
from the beginning, every new advance gave fre&s;h occasion
of di&s;content, and aggravated, in&s;tead of &s;oftening, the ab|horrence
entertained again&s;t the prelacy.</P>
<P>WHAT rendered the King's aim more apparent, were the
endeavours, which, at the &s;ame time, he u&s;ed to introduce
into Scotland &s;ome of the ceremonies of the church of Eng|land:
The re&s;t, it was ea&s;ily fore&s;een, would &s;oon, follow.
The fire of devotion, excited by novelty, and inflamed by
oppo&s;ition, had &s;o po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the minds of the Scots reform|ers,
that all rites and ornaments, and even order of wor|&s;hip,
were di&s;dainfully rejected as u&s;ele&s;s burthens; retard|ing
the imagination in its rapturous ec&s;ta&s;ies, and cramping
the operations of that divine &s;pirit by which they &s;uppo&s;ed
them&s;elves to be animated. A mode of wor&s;hip was e&s;tablished,
the mo&s;t naked and mo&s;t &s;imple imaginable; one that
borrowed nothing from the &s;en&s;es; but repo&s;ed it&s;elf intirely
on the contemplation of, that divine e&s;&s;ence which di&s;covers
it&s;elf to the under&s;tanding only. This &s;pecies of devotion, &s;o
worthy of the &s;upreme Being, but &s;o little &s;uitable to hu|man
frailty, was ob&s;erved to occa&s;ion great di&s;turbances in
the brea&s;t, and in many re&s;pects to confound all rational
<PB N="23" REF="29">
principles of conduct and behaviour.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1717.</NOTE> The mind, &s;training
for the&s;e extraordinary raptures, reaching them by &s;hort
glances, &s;inking again under its own weakne&s;s, rejecting all
exterior aid of pomp and ceremony, was &s;o occupied in this
inward life, that it fled from every intercour&s;e of &s;ociety,
and from every &s;weet or chearful amu&s;ement, which could
&s;often or humanize the character. It was obvious to all di&s;|cerning
eyes, and had not e&s;caped the King's, that by the
prevalence of fanatici&s;m, a gloomy and &s;ullen di&s;po&s;ition
e&s;tablished it&s;elf among the people; a &s;pirit, ob&s;tinate and
dangerous; independent and di&s;orderly; animated equally
with a contempt of authority, and a hatred to every other
mode of religion, particularly to the catholic. In order to
mellow the&s;e humours, James endeavoured to infu&s;e a &s;mall
tincture of ceremony into the national wor&s;hip, and to intro|duce
&s;uch rites as might, in &s;ome degree, occupy the mind,
and plea&s;e the &s;en&s;es, without departing too far from that &s;implicity,
by which the reformation was di&s;tingui&s;hed. The
finer arts too, tho' &s;till rude in the&s;e northern kingdoms, were
employed to adorn the churches; and the King's chapel,
in which an organ was erected, and &s;ome picturs and &s;ta|tues
di&s;played, was propo&s;ed as a model to the re&s;t of the
nation. But mu&s;ic was grating to the prejudiced ears of the
Scots clergy; &s;culpture and painting appeared in&s;truments of
idolatry; the &s;urplide was a rag of popery, and each mo|tion
or ge&s;ture, pre&s;cribed by the liturgy, was a &s;tep to|wards
that &s;piritual Babylon, &s;o much the object of their
horror and aver&s;ion. Every thing was deemed impious, but
their own my&s;tical comments on the &s;criptures, which they
idolized, and who&s;e ea&s;tern prophetic &s;tyle they employed
in every common occurrence of life.</P>
<P>IT will not be nece&s;&s;ary to give a particular account of
the ceremonies which the King was &s;o intent to e&s;tabli&s;h.
Such in&s;titutions, for a time, are e&s;teemed either too divine
to have proceeded from any other being than the &s;upreme
Creator of the univer&s;e, or too diabolical to have been de|rived

from other than an internal demon. But no &s;ooner is
the mode or the controver&s;y pa&s;t, than they are univer&s;ally
di&s;covered to be of &s;o little importance as &s;carce to be men|tioned
with dignity amid&s;t the ordinary cour&s;e of human
tran&s;actions. It is here &s;ufficient to remark, that the rites
introduced by James regarded the kneeling at the &s;acrament,
private communion, private bapti&s;m, confirmation of chil|dren,
and the ob&s;ervance of Chri&s;tmas and other fe&s;tivals<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Franklyn, p. 25. Spot&s;wood.</NOTE>.
The&s;e ceremonies were afterwards known by the name of
the articles of Perth, from the place where they were rati|&s;ied
by the a&s;&s;embly.</P>
<P>A CONFORMITY of di&s;cipline and wor&s;hip between the
churches of England and Scotland, which was James's aim,
he never could hope to e&s;tabli&s;h, but by fir&s;t procuring an
acknowlegement of his own authority in all eccle&s;ia&s;tical
cau&s;es; and nothing could be more contrary to the practice
as well as principles of the pre&s;byterian clergy. The eccle|&s;ia&s;tical
courts po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the power of denouncing excom|munication;
and that &s;entence, be&s;ides the &s;piritual con|&s;equences
&s;uppo&s;ed to follow from it, was attended with
immediate effects of the mo&s;t important nature. The per|&s;on
excommunicated was &s;hunned by every one as pro&s;ane
and impious; and his whole e&s;tate, during his life-time, and
all his moveables, for ever, were forfeited to the crown.
Nor were the previous &s;teps, requi&s;ite before in&s;ticting this
&s;entence, formal or regular, in proportion to the weight of
it. Without accu&s;er, without &s;ummons, without trial, any
eccle&s;ia&s;tical court, however inferior, &s;ometimes pretended,
in a &s;ummary manner, to pronounce a &s;entence of excom|munication,
for any cau&s;e, and again&s;t any per&s;on, even
tho' he lived not within the bounds of their juri&s;diction<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Spot&s;wood.</NOTE>.
And, by this means, the whole tyranny of the inqui&s;ition,
tho' without its order, was introduced into the kingdom.</P>
<P>BUT the clergy contented not them&s;elves with the unli|mited
juri&s;diction, which they exerci&s;ed in eccle&s;ia&s;tical mat|ters
<PB N="25" REF="33">
They a&s;&s;umed a cen&s;orial power over every part of ad|mini&s;tration;
and, in all their &s;ermons, and even prayers,
mingling politics with religion, they inculcated the mo&s;t &s;e|ditious
and mo&s;t turbulent principles. Black, mini&s;ter of
St. Andrews, went &s;o far<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">1596.</NOTE>, in a &s;ermon, as to pronounce
all kings the devil's children; he gave the Queen of England
the appellation of athei&s;t; he &s;aid, that the treachery of the
King's heart was now fully di&s;covered; and in his prayers
for the Queen he u&s;ed the&s;e words; <HI>We mu&s;t pray for her
for the fa&s;hion's &s;ake, but we have no cau&s;e: She will ne|ver
do us any good.</HI> When &s;ummoned before the privy
council, he refu&s;ed to an&s;wer to a civil court for any thing
delivered from the pulpit, even tho' the crime, of which he
was accu&s;ed, was of a civil nature. The church adopted
his cau&s;e. They rai&s;ed a &s;edition in Edinburgh<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">17 Dec. 1596.</NOTE>. The
King, during &s;ome time, was in the hands of the enraged
populace; and it was not without courage, as well as dex|terity,
that he was able to extricate him&s;elf<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Spot&s;wood.</NOTE>. A few
days after a mini&s;ter, preaching in the principal church of
that capital, &s;aid, that the King was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with a devil;
and, that one devil being expelled, &s;even wor&s;e had en|tered
in his place<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>. To which he added, that the
&s;ubjects might lawfully ri&s;e, and take the &s;word out of his
hand. Scarce, even during the darke&s;t night of papal &s;u|per&s;tition,
are there found &s;uch in&s;tances of prie&s;tly en|croachments,
as the annals of Scotland pre&s;ent to us during
that period.</P>
<P>BY the&s;e extravagant &s;tretches of power, and by the pa|tient
conduct of James, the church began to lo&s;e ground,
even before the King's acce&s;&s;ion to the throne of England:
But no &s;ooner had that event taken place, than he made the
Scots clergy &s;en&s;ible, that he was become the &s;overeign of a
great kingdom, which he governed with great authority.
Tho' formerly he would have thought him&s;elf happy to have
made a fair partition with them of the civil and eccle&s;ia&s;tical
<PB N="26" REF="34">
authority, he was now re&s;olved to exert a &s;upreme juri&s;dic|tion
in church as well as &s;tate, and to put an end to their &s;e|ditious
practices. An a&s;&s;embly had been &s;ummoned at
Aberdeen<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">July 1604.</NOTE> but, on account of his journey to London,
he prorogued it to the year following. Some of the clergy,
di&s;avowing his eccle&s;ia&s;tical &s;upremacy, met at the time fir&s;t
appointed, notwith&s;tanding his prohibition. He threw them
into pri&s;on. Such of them as &s;ubmitted, and acknowleged
their error, he pardoned. The re&s;t he brought to their
trial. They were condemned for high trea&s;on. He gave
them their lives; but bani&s;hed them the kingdom. Six of
them &s;uffered this penalty<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Spot&s;wood.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE general a&s;&s;embly was afterwards induced<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">6th of June 1610.</NOTE> to ac|knowlege
the King's authority in &s;ummoning eccle&s;ia&s;tical
courts, and to &s;ubmit to the juri&s;diction and vi&s;itation of the
bi&s;hops. Even their favourite &s;entence of excommunication
was declared invalid, unle&s;s confirmed by the ordinary.
The King recommended to the pre&s;byteries, the members
whom they &s;hould elect to this a&s;&s;embly; and every thing
was conducted in it with little appearance of choice and liberty<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Spot&s;|wood.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BY his own prerogative likewi&s;e, which he &s;eems to have
&s;tretched on this occa&s;ion, the King erected a court of high
commi&s;&s;ion<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">15 Feb. 1610.</NOTE>, in imitation of that e&s;tabli&s;hed in England.
The bi&s;hops and a few of the clergy, who had been &s;um|moned
together, willingly acknowledged this court; and it
proceeded immediately upon bu&s;ine&s;s, as if its authority
had been grounded on the full con&s;ent of the whole legi&s;|lature.</P>
<P>BUT James re&s;erved the final blow for the time when he
&s;hould him&s;elf pay a vi&s;it to Scotland.<NOTE PLACE="marg">13th June.</NOTE> He propo&s;ed to the
Parliament, which was then a&s;&s;embled, that they &s;hould
enact, that, &startq;whatever his Maje&s;ty &s;hould determine in the
external government of the church, with the con&s;ent of
<PB N="27" REF="35">
the archbi&s;hops, bi&s;hops, and a competent number of the
mini&s;try, &s;hould have the force of a law&endq;<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Spot&s;wood. Franklyn, p. 29.</NOTE>. What num|ber
&s;hould be deemed competent was not determined: And
their nomination was left intirely to the King: So that his
eccle&s;ia&s;tical authority, had this bill pa&s;&s;ed, would have been
e&s;tabli&s;hed in its full extent. Some of the clergy prote&s;ted.
They apprehended, they &s;aid, that the purity of their church
would, by means of this new authority, be polluted with
all the rites and liturgy of the church of England. James,
dreading clamour and oppo&s;ition, dropped the act, which
had already pa&s;&s;ed the lords of articles; and a&s;&s;erted, that
the inherent prerogative of the crown contained more
power than was recognized by this bill.<NOTE PLACE="marg">10th July.</NOTE> Some time after, he
called, at St. Andrews, a meeting of the bi&s;hops and thirty|&s;ix
of the mo&s;t eminent clergy. He there declared his re&s;o|lution
of exerting his prerogative, and of e&s;tabli&s;hing, by
his own authority, the few ceremonies which he had recom|mended
to them. They entreated him rather to &s;ummon a
general a&s;&s;embly, and to procure their con&s;ent. The King
a&s;king, <HI>What a&s;&s;urance he might have of the a&s;&s;embly's con|&s;ent?</HI>
they an&s;wered, That they &s;aw no rea&s;on to the con|trary,
and knew that the a&s;&s;embly would yield to any rea&s;on|able
demand of his Maje&s;ty. <HI>But if it fall out otherwi&s;e,</HI> &s;aid
the King, <HI>and my demand be refu&s;ed; my difficulty &s;hall be
the greater: And when I &s;hall u&s;e my authority in e&s;tabli&s;h|ing
the ceremonies, they will call me tyrant and per&s;ecutor.</HI>
All crying out, that none could be &s;o mad; <HI>$et experience,</HI>
&s;aid the King, <HI>tells me, that it may readily happen. There|fore,
unle&s;s I be made &s;ure, I will not give way to an a&s;&s;embly.</HI>
Galloway, one of the mini&s;ters, &s;aying, that the
Archbi&s;hop of St. Andrews would an&s;wer for them, the
Archbi&s;hop refu&s;ed: For that he had been deceived by
them, and had &s;ufficiently experienced their breach of pro|mi&s;e.
Then &s;aid Galloway, <HI>If your Maje&s;ty will tru&s;t me,
<PB N="28" REF="36">
I will an&s;wer for them</HI><NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Spot&s;wood. Franklyn, p. 29.</NOTE>. The King con&s;ented; and an
a&s;&s;embly was &s;ummoned on the 25th of November en|&s;uing.</P>
<P>YET this a&s;&s;embly, which met after the King's depart|ure
from Scotland, eluded all his applications; and it was
not till the &s;ub&s;equent year, that he was able to procure a
vote for receiving his ceremonies. And thro' every &s;tep of
this affair, in the parliament as well as in all the general
a&s;&s;emblies, the nation betrayed the utmo&s;t reluctance to
all the&s;e innovations; and nothing but James's importu|nity
and authority had extorted a &s;eeming con&s;ent, which
was belied by the inward &s;entiments of all ranks of people.
Even the few, over whom religious prejudices were not
prevalent, thought the national honour &s;acrificed by a &s;er|vile
imitation of the modes of wor&s;hip practi&s;ed in England.
And every prudent man agreed in condemning the mea&s;ures
of the King, who, by an ill-timed zeal for in&s;ignificant ce|remonies,
had betrayed, tho' in an oppo&s;ite manner, equal
narrowne&s;s of mind with the per&s;ons whom he treated with
&s;uch contempt. It was judged, that, had not the&s;e dan|gerous
humours been irritated by oppo&s;ition; had they been
allowed peaceably to evaporate; they would at la&s;t have &s;ub|&s;ided
within the limits of law and civil authority. And as
all fanatical religions naturally circum&s;cribe to very narrow
bounds the numbers and riches of the eccle&s;ia&s;tics; no
&s;ooner is their fir&s;t fire &s;pent, than they lo&s;e the mo&s;t dan|gerous
part of their credit over the people, and leave them
under the natural and beneficent influence of their civil and moral obligations.</P>
<P>AT the &s;ame time that James &s;hocked, in &s;o violent a
manner, the religious principles of his Scots &s;ubjects, he
acted in oppo&s;ition to tho&s;e of his Engli&s;h. He had ob|&s;erved,
in his progre&s;s thro' England, that a judaical ob|&s;ervance
of the Sunday, chiefly by means of the puritans,
<PB N="29" REF="37">
was every day gaining ground throughout the kingdom,
and that the people, under colour of religion, were, contrary
to former practice, debarred from &s;uch &s;ports and recreations
as contributed both to their health and their amu&s;ement<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Kennet, p. 709.</NOTE>.
Fe&s;tivals, which in other nations and ages are partly dedi|cated
to public wor&s;hip, partly to mirth and &s;ociety, were
here totally appropriated to the offices of religion, and &s;erved
to nouri&s;h tho&s;e &s;ullen and gloomy contemplations, to which
the people were, of them&s;elves, &s;o unfortunately &s;ubject.
The King fal&s;ely concluded, that it would be ea&s;y to infu&s;e
chearfulne&s;s into this dark &s;pirit of devotion. He i&s;&s;ued a
proclamation to allow and encourage, after divine &s;ervice,
all kinds of lawful games and exerci&s;es; and, by his autho|rity,
he endeavoured to give &s;anction to a practice which
his &s;ubjects regarded as the utmo&s;t profanene&s;s and im|piety<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Franklyn, p. 31. To &s;how how rigid the Engli&s;h, chiefly the puritans, were in this particular, a bill was introduced into the Hou&s;e of Commons, in the 18th of the King, for the more &s;trict ob&s;ervation of the Sunday, which they affected to call the Sabbath. One Shepherd oppo&s;ed this bill, objected to the appellation of Sabbath as puritani|cal, defended dancing by the example of David, and &s;eems even to have ju&s;tified &s;ports on that day. For this profanene&s;s he was expelled the hou&s;e, by the &s;ugge&s;tion of Mr. Pym. The Hou&s;e of Lords oppo&s;ed &s;o far this puritanical &s;pirit of the Commons, that they propo&s;ed, that the appellation of <HI>Sabbath</HI> &s;hould be changed into that of <HI>Lord's Day.</HI> Journ. 15, 16 Feb. 1620. 28 May 1621. In Shepherd's &s;entence, his offence is &s;aid by the Hou&s;e to be great, exorbitant, unparalleled.</NOTE>.</P>

<P>AT the time when Sir Walter Raleigh was fir&s;t confined
to the Tower,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. XLVIII.</NOTE> his violent and haughty temper had
rendered him the mo&s;t unpopular man in England,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1618.</NOTE> and his
condemnation was chiefly owing to that public odium under
which he laboured.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sir Walter Raleigh's expedition.</NOTE> During the thirteen years impri&s;on|ment
which he &s;uffered, the &s;entiments of the nation were
much changed with regard to him. Men had lei&s;ure to
reflect on the hard&s;hip, not to &s;ay inju&s;tice, of his &s;entence;
they pitied his active and enterprizing &s;pirit, which lan|gui&s;hed
in the rigours of confinement; they were &s;truck
with the exten&s;ive genius of the man, who, being educated
amid&s;t naval and military enterprizes, had &s;urpa&s;&s;ed in the
pur&s;uits of literature even tho&s;e of the mo&s;t reclu&s;e and &s;e|dentary
lives; and they admired his unbroken magnanimity,
which, at his age and under his circum&s;tances, could en|gage
him to undertake and execute &s;o great a work as his
hi&s;tory of the world. To increa&s;e the&s;e favourable di&s;po|&s;itions,
on which he built the hopes of recovering his li|berty,
he &s;pread the report of a golden mine, which he had
di&s;covered in Guiana, and which was &s;ufficient, according
to his repre&s;entation, not only to inrich all the adventurers,
but to afford immen&s;e trea&s;ures to the nation. The King
gave little credit to the&s;e mighty promi&s;es; both becau&s;e
he believed that no &s;uch mine as that de&s;cribed was any|where
in nature, and becau&s;e he con&s;idered Raleigh as a
<PB N="31" REF="39">
man of de&s;perate fortunes, who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s it was, by any
means, to procure his freedom, and to rein&s;tate him&s;elf in
credit and authority. Thinking, however, that he had al|ready
undergone &s;ufficient puni&s;hment, he relea&s;ed him
from the Tower; and when his vaunts of the golden mine
had engaged multitudes to a&s;&s;ciate with him, the King
gave them permi&s;&s;ion to try the adventure, and, at their
de&s;ire, conferred on Raleigh authority over his fellow|adventurers.
Tho' &s;trongly &s;ollicited, he &s;till refu&s;ed to
grant him a pardon, which &s;eemed a natural con&s;equence,
when he was intru&s;ted with power and command. But
James declared him&s;elf &s;till diffident of Raleigh's de&s;igns:
and he intended, he &s;aid, to re&s;erve the former &s;entence, as
a check upon his future behaviour.</P>
<P>RALEIGH well knew, that it was far from the King's
purpo&s;e to invade any of the Spani&s;h &s;ettlements: He there|fore
firmly denied that Spain had planted any colonies on
that part of the coa&s;t where his mine lay. When the am|ba&s;&s;ador
of that nation, the famous Gondomar, alarmed at
his preparations, carried complaints to the King, Raleigh
&s;till prote&s;ted the innocence of his intentions: And James
a&s;&s;ured Gondomar, that he dur&s;t not form any ho&s;tile at|tempt,
and that he &s;hould pay with his head for &s;o auda|cious
an enterprize. But the mini&s;ter wi&s;ely concluding,
that twelve armed ve&s;&s;els were not fitted out without &s;ome
purpo&s;e of inva&s;ion, conveyed the intelligence to the court
of Madrid, who immediately gave orders for arming and
fortifying all their &s;ettlements, particularly tho&s;e along the
coa&s;t of Guiana.</P>
<P>WHEN the courage and avarice of the Spaniards and
Portugue&s;e had di&s;covered &s;o many new worlds, they were
re&s;olved to &s;hew them&s;elves &s;uperior to the barbarous hea|thens
whom they invaded, not only in arts and arms, but
al&s;o in the ju&s;tice of the quarrel: They applied to Alex|ander
VI. who then filled the papal chair; and he gene|rou&s;ly
be&s;towed on the Spaniards the whole we&s;tern, and on
<PB N="32" REF="40">
the Portugue&s;e the whole ea&s;tern part of the globe. The
more &s;crupulous prote&s;tants, who acknowleged not the
authority of the Roman pontiff, e&s;tabli&s;hed the fir&s;t di&s;co|very
as the foundation of <HI>their</HI> title; and if a pirate or &s;ea|adventurer
of their nation had but erected a &s;tick or &s;tone
on the coa&s;t, as a memorial of his taking po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, they
concluded the whole continent to belong to them, and
thought them&s;elves intitled to expel or exterminate, as
u&s;urpers, the antient po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors and inhabitants. It was in
this manner that Sir Walter Raleigh, about twenty-three
years before, had acquired to the crown of England a claim
to the continent of Guiana, a region as large as the half
of Europe; and tho' he had immediately after left the
coa&s;t, he yet pretended that the Engli&s;h title to the whole
remained certain and indefeazable. But it had happened in
the mean time, that the Spaniards, not knowing or not ac|knowleging
this imaginary claim, had taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of
a part of Guiana, had formed a &s;ettlement on the river
Oronooko, had built a little town called St. Thomas, and
were there working &s;ome mines of &s;mall value.</P>
<P>TO this place Raleigh directly bent his cour&s;e; and, re|maining
him&s;elf at the mouth of the river with five of
the large&s;t &s;hips, he &s;ent up the re&s;t to St. Thomas, under
the command of his &s;on, and of captain Keymis, a per&s;on
intirely devoted to him. The Spaniards, who had expected
this inva&s;ion, fired on the Engli&s;h at their landing, were
repul&s;ed, and pur&s;ued into the town. Young Raleigh, to
encourage his men, called out, <HI>That this was the true mine,
and none but fools looked for any other;</HI> and advancing upon
the Spaniards, received a &s;hot, of which he immediately
expired. This di&s;mayed not Keymis and the others. They
carried on the attack, got po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the town, which
they afterwards &s;et on fire; and found not in it any thing of
value.</P>
<P>RALEIGH did not pretend that he had him&s;elf &s;een the
mine, which he had engaged &s;o many people to go in que&s;t
<PB N="33" REF="41">
of: It was Keymis, he &s;aid, who had formerly di&s;covered
it, and had brought him that lump of ore, which pro|mi&s;ed
&s;uch immen&s;e trea&s;ures. Yet Keymis, who owned
that he was within two hours march of the place, refu&s;ed,
on the mo&s;t ab&s;urd pretences, to take any effectual &s;tep to|wards
the finding it; and he returned immediately to Raleigh,
with the melancholy news of his &s;on's death, and the ill &s;uc|ce&s;s
of the enterprize. Sen&s;ible to reproach, and dreading
puni&s;hment for his behaviour, Keymis, in de&s;pair, retired
into his cabbin, and put an end to his own life.</P>
<P>THE other adventurers now concluded that they were de|ceived
by Raleigh; that he never had known of any &s;uch
mine as he pretended to go in &s;earch of; that his intention
had ever been to plunder St. Thomas; and having encou|raged
his company by the &s;poils of that place, to have thence
proceeded to the inva&s;ion of the other Spani&s;h &s;ettlements;
that he expected to repair his ruined fortunes by &s;uch daring
enterprizes; and that he tru&s;ted to the money he &s;hould ac|quire,
for making his peace with England; or if that view
failed him, that he propo&s;ed to retire into &s;ome other coun|try,
where his riches would &s;ecure his retreat.</P>
<P>THE &s;mall acqui&s;itions, gained by the &s;poil of St. Thomas,
di&s;couraged Raleigh's companions from entering into the&s;e
views; tho' there were many circum&s;tances in the treaty and
late tran&s;actions between the two nations, which invited them
to engage in &s;uch a piratical war again&s;t the Spaniards.</P>
<P>WHEN England made peace with Spain, the example
of Henry IV. was imitated, who, at the treaty of Vervins,
finding a difficulty in adju&s;ting all que&s;tions with regard to
the Indian trade, had agreed to pa&s;s over that article in to|tal
&s;ilence. The Spaniards, having, all along, publi&s;hed
fevere edicts again&s;t the intercour&s;e of any European nation
with their colonies, interpreted this &s;ilence in their own fa|vour,
and con&s;idered it as a tacit acquie&s;cence of Eng|land
in the e&s;tabli&s;hed laws of Spain. The Engli&s;h, on
the contrary, pretended, that, as they had never been ex|cluded
<PB N="34" REF="42">
by any treaty from commerce with any part of the
King of Spain's dominions, it was &s;till as lawful for them to
trade with his &s;ettlements in either Indies, as with his Eu|ropean
territories. In con&s;equence of this ambiguity, many
adventurers from England failed to the Spani&s;h Indies, and
met with &s;evere puni&s;hment, when caught; as they, on the
other hand, often &s;tole, and, when &s;uperior in power, forced
a trade with the inhabitants, and re&s;i&s;ted, nay &s;ometimes
plundered, the Spani&s;h governors. Violences of this nature,
which had been carried to a great height on both &s;ides, it
was agreed to bury in total oblivion; becau&s;e of the diffi|culty,
which was found, of remedying them, upon any fixed principles.</P>
<P>BUT as there appeared a great difference between pri|vate
adventures in &s;ingle &s;hips, and a fleet acting under
a royal commi&s;&s;ion; Raleigh's companions thought it &s;afe&s;t
to return immediately to England, and carry him along with
them to an&s;wer for his conduct. 'Tis pretended, that he
employed many artifices, fir&s;t to engage them to attack
the Spani&s;h &s;ettlements, and, failing of that, to make his
e&s;cape into France: But, all the&s;e proving un&s;ucce&s;s|ful,
he was delivered into the King's hands, and &s;trictly
examined, as well as his fellow-adventurers, before the
privy council. The council found no difficulty in pro|nouncing,
that the former, &s;u&s;picions, with regard to Ra|leigh's
intentions, had been well grounded; that he had
abu&s;ed the King in the repre&s;entations which he had made
of his projected adventure; that he had acted in an offen&s;ive
and ho&s;tile manner again&s;t his Maje&s;ty's allies; and that he had
wilfully burned and de&s;troyed a town belonging to the King
of Spain. He might have been tried either by common
law for this violence and piracy, or by martial law for breach
of orders: But it was an e&s;tabli&s;hed principle among tho&s;e of
the long robe, that, as he lay under an actual attainder for
high trea&s;on, he could not be brought to a new trial for
any other crime. To &s;atisfy, therefore, the court of
Spain, who rai&s;ed the loude&s;t complaints again&s;t him, the
<PB N="35" REF="43">
King made u&s;e of that power which he had purpo&s;ely re|&s;erved
in his own hand, and &s;igned the warrant for his ex|ecution
upon the former &s;entence<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot"><P>SOME of the facts in this narration, which &s;eem to condemn Raleigh, are taken from the King's declaration, which being publi&s;hed by authority, when the facts were recent, being extracted from examinations before the privy council, and &s;ub&s;cribed by &s;ix coun&s;ellors, among whom was Abbot archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, a prelate no-wife complai&s;ant to the court, mu&s;t be allowed to have great weight, or rather to be of undoubted credit. Yet the mo&s;t material facts are confirmed either by the nature and rea&s;on of the thing, or by Sir Walter's own apology and his letters. The King's vindication is in the Harleyan mi&s;cellany, Vol. 3. No. 2.</P>
<P>1. THERE &s;eems to be an improbability, that the Spaniards, who knew nothing of Raleigh's pretended mine, &s;hould have built a town, in &s;o wide a coa&s;t, within three miles of it. The chances are extremely again&s;t &s;uch a &s;uppo&s;ition: And it is more natural to think, that the view of plun|dering the town led him thither, than that of working a mine. 2. No &s;uch mine is there found to this day. 3. Raleigh in fact found no mine, and in fact he plundered and burned a Spani&s;h town. Is it not more probable, therefore, that the latter was his intention? How can the &s;ecrets of his brea&s;t be rendered &s;o vi&s;ible as to counterpoi&s;e certain facts? 4. He confe&s;&s;es, in his letter to Lord Carew, that tho' he knew it, yet he concealed from the King the &s;ettlement of the Spaniards on that coa&s;t. Does not this fact alone render him &s;ufficiently criminal? 5. His commi&s;&s;ion impowers him only to &s;ettle on a coa&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by &s;avage and barbarous inhabitants. Was it not the mo&s;t evident breach of orders to di&s;embark on a coa&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by Spaniards? 6. His orders to Keymis, when he &s;ent him up the river, are contained in his own apology, and from them it appears, that he knew (what was unavoidable) that the Spaniards would re&s;i&s;t, and would oppo&s;e the Eng|li&s;h landing and taking po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the country. His intentions, therefore, were ho&s;tile from the beginning. 7. Without provocation, and even when at a di&s;tance, he gave Keymis orders to di&s;lodge the Spaniards from their own town. Could any enterprize be more ho&s;tile? And, con&s;idering the Spaniards as allies to the nation, could any enterprize be more criminal? Was he not the aggre&s;&s;or, even though it &s;hould be true that the Spaniards fired upon his men at landing? 'Tis &s;aid, he killed three or four hundred of them. Is that &s;o light a matter? 8. In his letter to the King, and in his apology, he grounds his defence on former ho&s;tilities exerci&s;ed by the Span ards again&s;t other companies of Engli&s;hmen. The&s;e are accounted for by the ambiguity of the treaty between the nations. And it is plain, that tho' the&s;e might po&s;&s;ibly be rea&s;ons for the King's declaring war again&s;t that nation, they could never intitle Raleigh to declare war, and, without any commi&s;&s;ion, or contrary to his commi&s;&s;ion, to invade the Spani&s;h &s;ettlements. He pretends indeed that peace was never made with Spain in the Indies: A mo&s;t ab&s;urd notion! The chief hurt which the Spaniards could receive from England was in the Indies; and they never would have made peace at all, if ho&s;tili|ties had been &s;till to be continued on the&s;e &s;ettlements. By &s;ecret agreement, the Engli&s;h were &s;till allowed to &s;upport the Dutch even after the treaty of peace. If they had al&s;o been allowed to invade the Spani&s;h &s;ettlements, the treaty had been a full peace to England, while the Spaniards were &s;till ex|po&s;ed to the full effects of war. 9. If the claim to the property of that country, as fir&s;t di&s;coverer, was good, in oppo&s;ition to pre&s;ent &s;ettlement, as Raleigh pretends; why was it not laid before the King with all its circum|&s;tances, and &s;ubmitted to his judgment? 10. Raleigh's force is acknow|leged by him&s;elf to have been in&s;ufficient to &s;upport him in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of St. Thomas again&s;t the power of which Spain was ma&s;ter on that coa&s;t; yet it was &s;ufficient, as he owns, to take by &s;urprize and plunder twenty towns. It was not therefore his de&s;ign to &s;ettle, but to plunder. By the&s;e confe&s;|&s;ions, which I have here brought together, he plainly betrays him&s;elf. 11. Why did he not &s;tay and work his mine, as at fir&s;t he projected? He appre|hended that the Spaniards would be upon him with a greater force. But be|fore he left England, he knew that this mu&s;t be the ca&s;e if he invaded any part of the Spani&s;h colonies. His intention therefore never was to &s;ettle, but only to plunder. 12. He acknowleges that he knew neither the depth nor quantity of the mine, but only that there was &s;ome ore there. Would he have ventured all his fortune and credit on &s;o precarious a foundation? 13. Would the other adventurers, if made acquainted with this, have ri&s;qued every thing to attend him? Ought a &s;leet to have been equipped for an ex|periment? Was there not plainly an impo&s;ture in the management of this affair? 14. He &s;ays to Keymis, in his orders, Bring but a ba&s;ket or two of ore, and it will &s;atisfy the King, that my project was not imaginary. This was ea&s;ily done from the Spani&s;h mines; and he &s;eems to have been chiefly di&s;plea&s;ed at Keymis for not attempting it. Such a view was a premeditated apology to cover his cheat. 15. The King in his declaration imputes it to Raleigh, that as &s;oon as he was at &s;ea, he immediately fell into &s;uch uncer|tain and doubtful talk of his mine, and &s;aid, that it would be &s;uffcient if he brought home a ba&s;ketful of ore. From the circum&s;tance la&s;t-mentioned, it appears, that this imputation was not without rea&s;on. 16. There are many other circum&s;tances of great weight in the King's declaration; that Raleigh, when he fell down to Plymouth, took no pioneers along with him, which he always declared to be his intention; that he was no-way provided of in&s;tru|ments for working a mine, but had a &s;ufficient &s;tock of warlike &s;tores; that young Raleigh, in attacking the Spaniards, employed the words, which, in the narration, I have put into his mouth; that the mine was moveable, and &s;hifted as he &s;aw convenient: Not to mention many other public facts which prove him to be highly criminal again&s;t his companions as well as his coun|try. Howel in his letters &s;ays, that there lived in London, in 1645, an offi|cer, a man of honour, who a&s;&s;erted, that he heard young Raleigh &s;peak the&s;e words, Vol. ii. Letter 63. That was a time when there was no intere&s;t in maintaining &s;uch a fact. 17. Raleigh's account of his fir&s;t voyage to Guiana proves him to have been a man capable of the mo&s;t extravagant cre|dulity or mo&s;t impudent impo&s;ture. So ridiculous are the &s;tories which he tells of the Inca's chimerical empire in the mid&s;t of Guiana; the rich city of El Dorado, or Manao, two days journey in length, and &s;hining with gold and &s;ilver; the old Peruvian prophecies in favour of the Engli&s;h, who, he &s;ays, were exprefly named as the di&s;coverers of that country, long before any Eu|ropean had ever touched there; the Amazons or republic of women; and in general, the va&s;t and incredible riches which he &s;aw on that continent, where nobody has yet found any trea&s;ures. This whole narration is a proof that he was extremely defective either in &s;olid under&s;tanding, or morals, or both. No man's character indeed &s;eems ever to have been carried to &s;uch extremes as Raleigh's, by the oppo&s;ite pa&s;&s;ions of envy and pity. In the former part of his lif., when he was active and lived in the world, and was probably be&s;t known, he was the object of univer&s;al hatred and dete&s;tation throughout England; in the latter part, when &s;hut up in pri&s;on, he became, much more unrea&s;onably, the object of great love and admiration.</P>
<P>As to the circum&s;tances of the narration, that Raleigh's pardon was re|fu&s;ed him, that his former &s;entence was purpo&s;ely kept in force again&s;t him, and that he went out under the&s;e expre&s;s conditions, they may be &s;upported by the following authorities. 1. The King's word and that of &s;ix privy|coun&s;ellors, who affirm it for fact. 2. The nature of the thing. If no &s;u&s;picion had been entertained of his intentions, a pardon would never have been refu&s;ed to a man to whom authority was entru&s;ted. 3. The words of the commi&s;&s;ion it&s;elf, where he is &s;imply &s;tiled Sir Walter Raleigh, and not <HI>faith|ful and well-beloved,</HI> according to the u&s;ual and never-failing &s;tile on &s;uch occa|&s;ions. 4. In all the letters which he wrote home to Sir Ralph Winwood and to his own wife, he always con&s;iders him&s;elf as a per&s;on unpardoned, and liable to the law. He &s;eems indeed, immediately upon the failure of his enter|prize, to have become de&s;perate, and to have expected the fate which he met with.</P>
<P>'TIS pretended, that the King gave intelligence to the Spaniards of Raleigh's project; as if he had needed to lay a plot for the de&s;troying a man, who&s;e life had been fourteen years, and &s;till was, in his power. The Spaniards wanted no other intelligence to be on their guard, but the known and public fact of Raleigh's armament. And these was no rea&s;on why the King &s;hould conceal from them the project of a &s;ettlement, which Raleigh pretended, and the King believed to be intirely innocent.</P>
<P>THE King's chief blame &s;eems to have lain in his negligence, in allowing Raleigh to depart without a more exact &s;crutiny: But for this he apologizes, by &s;aying, that &s;ureties were required for the good behaviour of Raleigh and all his a&s;&s;ociates in the enterprize; but that they gave in bonds for one another: A cheat which was not perceived till they had failed, and which increa&s;ed the &s;u&s;picion of bad intentions.</P>
<P>PERHAPS the King ought al&s;o to have granted Raleigh a pardon for his old trea&s;on, and to have tried him anew for his new offences. His puni&s;hment in that ca&s;e would not only have been ju&s;t, but conducted in a ju&s;t and unexcep|tionable manner. But we are told that a ridiculous opinion at that time prevailed in the nation (and it is plainly &s;uppo&s;ed by Sir Walter in his apo|logy) that, by the treaty, war was allowed with the Spaniards in the Indies, tho' peace was made in Europe: And while that notion took place, no jury would have found Raleigh guilty. So that had not the King puni&s;hed him upon the old &s;entence, the Spaniards would have had a $word$ cau&s;e of complaint again&s;t the King &s;ufficient to have produced a war, at lea&s;t to have de&s;troyed all cordiality betwixt the nations.</P>
<P>THIS explication I thought nece&s;&s;ary, in order to clear up the &s;tory of Raleigh; which, tho' very obvious, is generally mi&s;taken in &s;o gro&s;s a man|ner, that I know not its parallel in the whole Engli&s;h hi&s;tory.</P></NOTE>.</P>

hard, which had been &s;o long &s;u&s;pended, and which &s;eemed
to have been tacitly pardoned by conferring on him a new
tru&s;t and commi&s;&s;ion, was deemed an in&s;tance of cruelty
and inju&s;tice. To &s;acri&s;ice, to a concealed enemy of Eng|land,
the life of the only man in the nation, who had a
high reputation for valour and military experience, was re|garded
as meanne&s;s and indi&s;cretion: And the intimate
connexions, which the King was now entering into with
Spain, being univer&s;ally di&s;ta&s;teful, rendered this proof of
his complaifance &s;till more odious and unpopular.</P>
<P>JAMES had entertained an opinion, which was peculiar
to him&s;elf, and which had been adopted by none of his
predece&s;&s;ors, that any alliance, below that of a king, was
unworthy a prince of Wales; and he never would allow
other than a daughter of France or Spain, to be mentioned
as a match for his &s;on<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Kennet, p. 703, 748.</NOTE>. This in&s;tance of pride, which
really implied meanne&s;s, as if he could receive honour from
any alliance, was &s;o well known that Spain had founded
on it the hopes of governing, in the mo&s;t important tran&s;|actions,
this monarch, &s;o little celebrated for politicks or
prudence. During the life of Henry, the King of Spain
had dropped &s;ome hints of be&s;towing on that Prince his
elde&s;t daughter, whom he afterwards di&s;po&s;ed of to the
young King of France, Lewis XIII. At that time, the
view of the Spaniards was to engage James into a neutra|lity
with regard to the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of Cleves, which was di&s;|puted
between the prote&s;tant and popi&s;n line<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Ru&s;hworth, vol. i. p. 2.</NOTE>. But the bait
did not then take; and James, in confequence of his alli|ance
with the Dutch, and Henry IV. of France, march|ed<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">1610.</NOTE>
4000 men, under the command of Sir Edward Cecil,
who joined the&s;e two powers, and put the Marquis of

GONDOMAR was, at this time, the Spani&s;h amba&s;&s;ador

made offer of the &s;econd daughter of Spain to Prince
Charles; and, that he might render the temptation irre|&s;i&s;tible
to the nece&s;&s;itous monarch, he gave hopes of an im|men&s;e
fortune which &s;hould attend the Prince&s;s. The court
of Spain, tho' determined to contract no alliance with a

artfully protracted, and, amid&s;t every di&s;appointment, &s;till

the &s;ixteenth and the &s;eventeenth centuries,<NOTE PLACE="marg">In&s;urrec|tions in Bo|hemia.</NOTE> the only
nations who had the honourable, tho' often melancholy
advantage, of making an effort for their expiring privileges,
were &s;uch as, together with the principles of civil liberty,
were animated with a zeal for religious parties and opinions.
Be&s;ides the irre&s;i&s;tible force of mercenary armies, the Euro|pean
princes po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed this advantage, that they were de|&s;cended
from the antient royal families; that they continued
the &s;ame appellations of magi&s;trates, the &s;ame appearance
of civil government; and re&s;training them&s;elves by all the
forms of legal admini&s;tration, could in&s;en&s;ibly impo&s;e the
yoke on thein unguarded &s;ubjects. Even the German na|tions,
who formerly broke the Roman chains, and re&s;tored
liberty to mankind, now lo&s;t their own liberty, and &s;aw
with grief the ab&s;olute authority of their princes firmly
e&s;tabli&s;hed among&s;t them. In their circum&s;tances, nothing
but a pious zeal, which di&s;regards all motives of human

any longer tho&s;e privileges, which their ance&s;tors,
through &s;o many ages, had tran&s;mitted to them.</P>
<P>As the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria, throughout all her exten&s;ive do|minions,
had ever made religion the pretence of their u&s;ur|pations,
they now met with re&s;i&s;tance from a like principle;
and the catholick religion, as u&s;ual, had ranged it&s;elf on the
&s;ide of monarchy; the prote&s;tant, on that of liberty. The
&s;tates of Bohemia, having taken arms again&s;t the Emperor
Mathias, continued their revolt again&s;t his &s;ucce&s;&s;or Ferdi|nand,
and claimed the ob&s;ervance of all the edicts enacted
in favour of the new religion, together with the re&s;toration
of their antient laws and con&s;titution. The neighbouring
principalities, Sile&s;ia, Moravia, Lu&s;atia, Au&s;tria, even the
kingdom of Hungary, took part in the quarrel; and through|out
all the&s;e populous and martial provinces, the &s;pirit of

though not more lenity and moderation, than are u&s;ual with

of his authority; and be&s;ides employing the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of his
&s;ubjects, who pro&s;e&s;&s;ed the antient religion, he engaged on
his &s;ide a powerful alliance of the neighbouring potentates.
All the catholick princes of the empire had embraced his
defence; even Saxony, the mo&s;t powerful of the pro|te&s;tant:
Poland had declared it&s;elf in his favour;<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Ibid. vol. i. p. 13, 1.</NOTE> and,
above all, the Spani&s;h monarch, deeming his own intere&s;t
clo&s;ely connected with that of the younger branch of his
family, prepared powerful &s;uccours from Italy, and from
the Low Countries; and he al&s;o advanced large &s;ums for
the &s;upport of Ferdinand and of the catholic religion.</P>
<P>THE &s;tates of Bohemia, alarmed with the&s;e mighty pre|parations,
began al&s;o to &s;olicit foreign a&s;&s;i&s;tance; and, to|gether
with that &s;upport, which they obtained from the
<PB N="42" REF="50">
evangelical union in Germany, they endeavoured to e&s;tabli&s;h
connexions with greater princes. They ca&s;t their eyes on
Frederic, Elector Palatine. They con&s;idered, that, be&s;ides
the power of his own &s;tate, which was con&s;iderable, he was
&s;on-in-law to the King of England, and nephew to Prince
Maurice, who&s;e authority was become almo&s;t ab&s;olute in the
United Provinces. They hoped, that the&s;e princes, moved
by the connexions of blood, as well as by the tie of their
common religion, would intere&s;t them&s;elves in all the fortunes
of Frederic, and would promote his greatne&s;s. They
therefore made him a tender of their crowm, which they
con&s;idered as elective; and the young Palatine &s;timulated
by ambition, without con&s;ulting either James<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Franklyn, p. 49.</NOTE> or Maurice,
who&s;e oppo&s;ition he fore&s;aw, immediately accepted the of|fer,
and marched all his forces into Bohemia, in &s;upport of
his new &s;ubjects.</P>
<P>THE news of the&s;e events no &s;ooner reached England,
than the whole kingdom was on fire to engage in the quarrel.
Scarce was the ardour greater, with which all the &s;tates of
Europe, in former ages, flew to re&s;cue the holy land from
the dominion of in&s;idels. The nation, at that time, were
&s;incerely attached to the blood of their monarchs, and they
con&s;idered their connexion with the Palatine, who had mar|ried
a daughter of England, as very clo&s;e and intimate. And,
when they heard of catholics carrying on wars and per&s;e|cutions
again&s;t prote&s;tants, they thought their own intere&s;t
mo&s;t deeply concerned, and regarded their neutrality as a
ba&s;e de&s;ertion of the cau&s;e of God, and of his holy reli|gion.
In &s;uch a quarrel, they would gladly have marched
to the oppo&s;ite extremity of Europe, have plunged them|&s;elves
into a chaos of German politics, and have expended
all the blood and trea&s;ure of the nation, by maintaining a
conte&s;t with the whole hou&s;e of Au&s;tria, at the very time,
and in the very place, in which it was the mo&s;t potent, and
almo&s;t irre&s;i&s;tible.</P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="51">
BUT James, be&s;ides that he had too little enterprize for
&s;uch va&s;t undertakings, was re&s;trained by another motive,
which had a mighty influence over him. He refu&s;ed to patronize
the revolt of &s;ubjects again&s;t their fovereign. From
the very fir&s;t he denied to his &s;on-in-law, the title of the
King of Bohemia<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Ru&s;hworth, vol. i. p. 12, 13.</NOTE>: He forbad him to be prayed for in the
churches under that appellation: And though he owned,
that he had no-wife examined the preten&s;ions, privileges,
and con&s;titution of the revolted &s;tates<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Franklyn, p. 48.</NOTE>; &s;o exalted was his
idea of the rights of kings, that he concluded &s;ubjects mu&s;t
ever be in the wrong, when they &s;tood in oppo&s;ition to
tho&s;e, who had acquired or a&s;&s;umed that maje&s;tic title.
Thus, even in mea&s;ures, founded on true politics, James
intermixed &s;o many narrow prejudices, as lo&s;t him all his
authority, and expo&s;ed him to the imputation of weakne&s;s
and of error.</P>
<P>MEAN while,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1620.</NOTE> affairs every where ha&s;tened to a cri&s;is.
Ferdinand levied a mighty force under the command of the
Duke of Bavaria and the Count of Bucquoy; and advanced
upon his enemy in Bohemia. In the Low Countries, Spi|nola
collected a veteran army of thirty thou&s;and men.
When Edmonds, the King's re&s;ident at Bru&s;&s;els, made re|mon&s;trances
to the Archduke Albert, he was an&s;wered, that
the orders for this armament had been tran&s;mitted to Spinola
from Madrid, and that he alone knew the &s;ecret intentions of
it. Spinola again told the mini&s;ter, that his orders were &s;till
&s;ealed; and that, if Edmonds would accompany him in his
march to Coblentz, he would there open them, and give
him full &s;atisfaction<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 44. Ru&s;hworth, vol. i. p. 14.</NOTE>. It was more ea&s;y to &s;ee his intentions,
than to prevent their &s;ucce&s;s. Almo&s;t at one time, it was
known in England, that Frederic, being defeated in the
great and deci&s;ive battle of Prague, had fled with his family
into Holland, and that Spinola had fallen upon the Palati|nate,

<P>HIGH were now the murmurs and complaints again&s;t the
King's neutrality and unactive di&s;po&s;ition. The happine&s;s and
tranquillity of their own country became di&s;ta&s;teful to the
Engli&s;h, when they reflected on the oppre&s;&s;ions and di&s;tre&s;&s;es
of their prote&s;tant brethren in Germany. They con&s;idered
not, that their interpo&s;ition in the wars of the continent,
though agreeable to religious zeal, could not, at that time,
be ju&s;tified by any &s;ound maxims of politics; that, however
exorbitant the Au&s;trian greatne&s;s, the danger was &s;till too
di&s;tant to give any ju&s;t alarms to England; that mighty re&s;i|&s;tance
would yet be made by &s;o many potent and warlike
princes and &s;tates in Germany, 'ere they would yield their
neck to the yoke; that France, now engaged to contract
a double alliance with the Au&s;trian family, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily
be &s;oon rouzed from her lethargy, and oppo&s;e the progre&s;s
of &s;o hated a rival; that in the farther advance of conque&s;ts,
even the intere&s;ts of the two branches of that ambitious fa|mily
mu&s;t interfere, and beget mutual jealou&s;y and oppo&s;i|tion;
that a land-war, carried on at &s;uch a di&s;tance, would
wa&s;te the blood and trea&s;ure of the Engli&s;h nation, without
any hopes of &s;ucce&s;s; that a &s;ea-war, indeed, might be
both &s;afe and &s;ucce&s;sful again&s;t Spain, but would not affect
the enemy in &s;uch vital parts as to make them &s;top their
career of &s;ucce&s;s in Germany, and abandon all their acqui|&s;itions;
and that the pro&s;pect of recovering the Palatinate
being at pre&s;ent de&s;perate, the affair was reduced to this
&s;imple que&s;tion, whether peace and commerce with Spain,
or the uncertain hopes of plunder and of conque&s;ts in the
Indies, were preferable? A que&s;tion, which, at the begin|ing
<PB N="45" REF="55">
of the King's reign,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Negotiati|ons with Spain.</NOTE> had already been decided, and
perhaps with rea&s;on, in favour of the former advantages.</P>
<P>JAMES might have defended his pacific mea&s;ures by &s;uch
plau&s;ible arguments: But the&s;e &s;eem not to have been alto|gether
the motives which &s;wayed him. He had entertained
the Utopian notion, that, as his own ju&s;tice and modera|tion
had &s;hone out &s;o con&s;picuou&s;ly through all the&s;e tran&s;|actions,
the whole hou&s;e of Au&s;tria, though not awed by
the power of England, would willingly, from mere re&s;pect
to his virtue, &s;ubmit them&s;elves $o &s;o equitable an arbitra|tion.
He flattered him&s;elf with hopes, that, after he had
formed an intimate connexion with the Spani&s;h monarch,
by means of his &s;on's marriage, the re&s;titution of the Palati|nate
might be procured, from the motive alone of friend|&s;hip
and per&s;onal regard. He perceived not, that his un|active
virtue, the more it was extolled, the greater contempt
was it expo&s;ed to. He was not &s;en&s;ible, that the Spani&s;h match
was it&s;elf attended with &s;uch difficulties, that all his art
of negotiation would &s;carce be able to &s;urmount them; much
le&s;s, that that match could in good policy be depended on,
as the means of procuring &s;uch extraordinary advantages.
His unwarlike di&s;po&s;ition, increa&s;ed by age, rivetted him &s;till
fa&s;ter in his errors, and determined him to &s;eek the re&s;tora|tion
of his &s;on-in-law, by remon&s;trances and entreaties, by
arguments and emba&s;&s;ies, rather that by blood and violence.
And the &s;ame defect of courage, which held him in awe of
foreign nations, made him likewi&s;e afraid of &s;hocking the
prejudices of his own &s;ubjects, and kept him from openly
avowing the mea&s;ures, which he was determined to pur&s;ue.
Or, perhaps, he hoped to turn the&s;e prejudices to account;
and, by their means, engage his people to furni&s;h him with
&s;upplies, of which their exce&s;&s;ive frugality had hitherto made
them &s;o &s;paring and re&s;erved<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Franklyn, p. 47. Ru&s;hworth, vol. i. p. 21.</NOTE>.</P>

HE fir&s;t tried the expedient of a benevolence or free-gift
from individuals,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Parlia|ment.</NOTE> pretending the urgency of the ca&s;e, which
would not allow lei&s;ure for any other mea&s;ure: But the jea|lou&s;y
of liberty was now rouzed, and the nation regarded
the&s;e pretended benevolences as real violences, contrary to
law and pernicious to freedom, however authorized by antient
precedent. A parliament was found to be the only re&s;ource,
which could furni&s;h any large &s;upplies; and writs were
accordingly i&s;&s;ued for &s;ummoning that great council of the
nation.</P>
<P>THIS parliament is remarkable for being the epoch,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1621.</NOTE> in
which were fir&s;t regularly formed, though without acquiring
the&s;e denominations,<NOTE PLACE="marg">16th of June.</NOTE> the parties of COURT and COUNTRY;
parties, which have ever &s;ince continued, and which, while
they oft threaten the total di&s;&s;olution of the government, are
the real cau&s;es of its permanent life and vigour. In the an|tient
feudal con&s;titution, of which the Engli&s;h partook with
other European nations, there was a mixture, not of au|thority
and liberty, which we have &s;ince enjoyed in this
i&s;land, and which now &s;ub&s;i&s;t uniformly together; but of
authority and anarchy, which perpetually &s;hocked with each
other, and which took place alternately, according as cir|cum&s;tances
were more or le&s;s favourable to either of them.
A parliament, compo&s;ed of barbarians, &s;ummoned from their
fields and fore&s;ts, unin&s;tructed by &s;tudy, conver&s;ation, or
travel; ignorant of their own laws and hi&s;tory, and unac|quainted
with the &s;ituation of all foreign nations; a parliament
called precariou&s;ly by the King, and di&s;&s;olved at his plea&s;ure;
&s;itting a few days, debating a few points prepared for them,
and who&s;e members were impatient to return to their own
ca&s;tles, where alone they were great, and to the chace, which
was their favourite amu&s;ement: Such a parliament was very
little fitted to enter into a di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of all the que&s;tions of go|vernment,
and to &s;hare, in a regular manner, the legal ad|mini&s;tration.
The name, the authority of the king alone
<PB N="47" REF="57">
appeared, in the common cour&s;e of government; in extra|ordinary
emergencies, he a&s;&s;umed, with &s;till better rea&s;on,
the &s;ole direction; the imperfect and unformed laws left, in
every thing, a latitude of interpretation; and when the
ends, pur&s;ued by the monarch, were, in general, agreeable
to his &s;ubjects, little &s;cruple or jealou&s;y was entertained,
with regard to the regularity of the means. During the
reign of an able, fortunate, or popular prince, no member
of either hou&s;e, much le&s;s of the lower, dur&s;t think of en|tering
into a formed party, in oppo&s;ition to the court; &s;ince
the di&s;&s;olution of the parliament mu&s;t, in a few days, leave
him unprotected, to the vengeance of his &s;overeign, and to
tho&s;e &s;tretches of prerogative, which were then &s;o ea&s;ily
made, in order to puni&s;h an obnoxious &s;ubject. During an
unpopular and weak reign, the current commonly ran &s;o
&s;trong again&s;t the monarch, that none dur&s;t inli&s;t them&s;elves
in the court-party; or if the prince was able to engage any
con&s;iderable barons on his &s;ide, the que&s;tion was decided
with arms in the field, not by debates or arguments in a fe|nate
or a&s;&s;embly. And upon the whole, the chief circum|&s;tance,
which, during antient times, retained the prince in
any legal form of admini&s;tration, was, that the &s;word, by
the nature of the feudal tenures, remained &s;till in the hands
of his &s;ubjects; and this irregular and dangerous check had
much more influence than the regular and methodical limits
of the laws and con&s;titution. As the nation could not be
compelled, it was nece&s;&s;ary that every public mea&s;ure of
con&s;equence, particularry that of levying new taxes, &s;hould
&s;eem to be adopted by common con&s;ent and approbation.</P>
<P>THE princes of the hou&s;e of Tudor, partly by the vi|gour
of their admini&s;tration, partly by the concurrence of
favourable circum&s;tances, had been able to e&s;tabli&s;h a more
regular &s;y&s;tem of government; but they drew the con&s;titu|tion
&s;o near to de&s;poti&s;m, as dimini&s;hed extremely the autho|rity
of the parliament. That &s;enate became, in a great de|gree,

have been regarded as a &s;pecies of rebellion: And even reli|gion,
the mo&s;t dangerous article in which innovations could
be introduced, had admitted, in the cour&s;e of a few years,
four &s;everal alterations, from the authority alone of the &s;ove|reign.
The parliament was not then the road to honour and
preferment: The talents of popular intrigue and eloquence
were uncultivated and unknown: And though that a&s;&s;embly
&s;till pre&s;erved authority, and retained the privilege of making
laws and be&s;towing public money, the members acquired
not, upon that account, either with prince or people, much
more weight and con&s;ideration. What powers were nece&s;|&s;ary
for conducting the machine of government, the King
was accu&s;tomed, of him&s;elf, to a&s;&s;ume. His own revenues
&s;upplied him with money &s;ufficient for his ordinary expences.
And when extraordinary emergencies occurred, the prince
needed not to &s;olicit votes in parliament, either for the making
laws or impo&s;ing taxes, both of which were now become re|qui&s;ite
for public intere&s;t and pre&s;ervation.</P>
<P>THE &s;ecurity of individuals, &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to the liberty of
popular councils, was totally unknown in that age. And as
no de&s;potic princes, &s;carce even the ea&s;tern tyrants, rule in|tirely
without the concurrence of &s;ome a&s;&s;emblies, which &s;up|ply
both advice and authority; little, but a mercenary force,
&s;eems then to have been wanting towards the e&s;tabli&s;hment of
a &s;imple monarchy in England. The militia, though more
favourable to regal authority, than the feudal in&s;titutions, was
much inferior, in this re&s;pect, to di&s;ciplined armies; and if it
did not pre&s;erve liberty to the people, it pre&s;erved, at lea&s;t,
the power, if ever the inclination &s;hould ari&s;e, of recover|ing
it.</P>
<P>BUT &s;o low, at that time, ran the inclination towards li|berty,
that Elizabeth, the la&s;t of that arbitrary line, her&s;elf
no le&s;s arbitrary, was yet the mo&s;t renowned and mo&s;t popu|lar
of all the &s;overeigns, who had filled the throne of Eng|land.
It was natural for James to take the government as he
found it, and to pur&s;ue her mea&s;ures, which he heard &s;o
<PB N="49" REF="61">
much applauded; nor did his penetration extend &s;o far as to
di&s;cover, that neither his circum&s;tances nor his character
could &s;upport &s;o exten&s;ive an authority. His narrow reve|nues
and little frugality began now to render him dependent
on his people, even in the ordinary cour&s;e of admini&s;tration:
Their increa&s;ing knowlege di&s;covered to them that advantage,
which they had obtained; and made them &s;en&s;ible of the
ine&s;timable value of civil liberty. And as he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed too
little dignity to command re&s;pect, and too much good-nature
to impre&s;s fear, a new &s;pirit di&s;covered it&s;elf every day in the
parliament; and a party, jealous of a free con&s;titution, was
regularly formed in the hou&s;e of commons.</P>
<P>BUT notwith&s;tanding the&s;e advantages acquired to liber|ty,
&s;o exten&s;ive was royal authority, and &s;o firmly e&s;tabli&s;h|ed
in all its parts, that it is probable the patriots of that age
would have de&s;paired of ever re&s;i&s;ting it, had they not been
&s;timulated by religious motives, which in&s;pire a courage un|&s;urmountable
by any human ob&s;tacle.</P>
<P>THE &s;ame alliance, which has ever prevailed between
kingly power and eccle&s;ia&s;tical authority, was now fully
e&s;tabli&s;hed in England; and while the prince a&s;&s;i&s;ted the
clergy in &s;uppre&s;&s;ing &s;chi&s;matics and innovators, the clergy,
in return, inculcated the doctrine of an unre&s;erved &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion
and obedience to the civil magi&s;trate. The genius of the
church of England, &s;o kindly to monarchy, forwarded the
confederacy; its &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to epi&s;copal juri&s;diction; its at|tachment
to ceremonies, to order, and to a decent pomp and
&s;plendor of wor&s;hip; and in a word, its affinity to the tame
&s;uper&s;tition of the catholics, rather than to the wild fanati|$m
of the puritans.</P>
<P>ON the other hand, oppo&s;ition to the church, and the per|&s;ecutions
under which they laboured, were &s;ufficient to throw
the puritans into the country party, and to beget political
principles little favourable to the high preten&s;ions of the &s;ove|reign.
The &s;pirit too of enthu&s;ia&s;m; bold, daring, and
uncontrouled; &s;trongly di&s;po&s;ed their minds to adopt repub|lican
<PB N="50" REF="62">
tenets; and inclined them to arrogate, in their actions and
conduct, the &s;ame liberty, which they a&s;&s;umed, in their rap|turous
flights and ec&s;ta&s;ies. Ever &s;ince the fir&s;t origin of that
&s;ect, through the whole reign of Elizabeth as well as of
James, <HI>puritanical</HI> principles had been under&s;tood in a dou|ble
&s;en&s;e, and expre&s;&s;ed the opinions favourable both to po|litical
and to eccle&s;ia&s;tical liberty<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">D'Erves, p. 328.</NOTE>. And as the court, in or|der
to di&s;credit all parliamentary oppo&s;ition, affixed the de|nomination
of puritans to its antagoni&s;ts; the religious puri|tans
willingly adopted this idea, which was &s;o advantageous
to them, and which confounded their cau&s;e with that of the
patriots or country party. Thus were the civil and eccle&s;i|a&s;tical
factions regularly formed; and the humour of the na|tion,
during that age, running &s;trongly towards fanatical ex|travagancies,
the &s;pirit of civil liberty gradually revived from
its lethargy, and by means of its religious a&s;&s;ociate, from
which it reaped more advantage than honour, it &s;ecretly en|larged
its dominion over the greate&s;t part of the kingdom.</P>
<P>IN this parliament, however, it mu&s;t be owned, there ap|peared,
at fir&s;t, nothing but duty and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion on the part
of the commons; and they &s;eemed determined to &s;acrifice
every thing, in order to maintain a good corre&s;pondence with
their prince. They would allow no mention to be made of
the new cu&s;toms or impo&s;itions, which had been &s;o eagerly
di&s;puted in the former parliament<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Journ. 5 Dec. 1621.</NOTE>: The impri&s;onment of
the members of that parliament was here, by &s;ome, com|plained
of; but, by the authority of the graver and more
prudent part of the hou&s;e, that grievance was buried in ob|livion<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Journ. 12, 16 Feb. 1620.</NOTE>:
And being informed, that the King had remitted
&s;everal con&s;iderable &s;ums to the Palatine, they voted him two
&s;ub&s;idies without a negative<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Journ. 16 Feb. 1620.</NOTE>; and that too, at the very be|ginning
of the &s;e&s;&s;ion, contrary to the maxims frequently
adopted by their predece&s;&s;ors.</P>
<P><PB N="51" REF="63">
AFTERWARDS, they proceeded, but in a very temperate
manner, to the examination of grievances. They found,
that patents had been granted to Sir Giles Mompe&s;&s;on and Sir
Francis Michel, for the licen&s;ing inns and ale-hou&s;es; that
great &s;ums of money had been levied, under pretext of the&s;e
licences; and that &s;uch innkeepers as prefumed to continue
their bu&s;ine&s;s, without &s;atisfying the rapacity of the paten|tees,
had been &s;everely puni&s;hed by fines, impri&s;onments,
and other vexatious pro&s;ecutions.</P>
<P>THE &s;ame per&s;ons had al&s;o procured a patent, which
they &s;hared with Sir Edward Villiers, brother to Bucking|ham,
for the &s;ole making of gold and &s;ilver thread and lace,
and had obtained very extraordinary powers for preventing
any rival&s;hip in the&s;e manufactures: They were armed with
authority to &s;earch for all goods, which might interfere with
their patent; and even to puni&s;h, at their own will and di&s;|cretion,
the makers, importers, and venders of &s;uch com|modities.
Many had grievou&s;ly &s;uffered by this exorbitant
juri&s;diction; and the lace, which had been manufactured by
the patentees, was found univer&s;ally to be adulterated, and
to be compo&s;ed more of copper than of the precious me|tals.</P>
<P>THESE grievances the commons repre&s;ented to the King;
and they met with a very gracious and very cordial reception.
He &s;eemed even thankful for the information given him; and
declared him&s;elf a&s;hamed, that &s;uch abu&s;es, unknowingly
to him, had crept into his admini&s;tration. &startq;I a&s;&s;ure you,&endq;
&s;aid he, &startq;had I before heard the&s;e things complained of, I
would have done the office of a ju&s;t King, and out of par|liament

more, than you now intend to do<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Franklyn, p. 51. Ru&s;hworth, p. 25.</NOTE>.&endq; A &s;entence was
pa&s;t for the puni&s;hment of Michel and Mompe&s;&s;on<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Franklyn, p. 52. Ru&s;h|worth, vol. i. p. 27.</NOTE>. It was

than that of the others,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bacon's fall.</NOTE> he was ea&s;ily protected by the
credit of his brother, Buckingham<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Yelverton the attorney general was accu&s;ed by the commons for draw|ing the patents for the&s;e monopolies, and for &s;upporting them.

The lords were &s;o offended at the&s;e articles of defence, though nece&s;&s;ary to the attorney general, that they fined him 10,000 pounds to the King, 5000 to the duke. The fines, however, were afterwards remitted. Franklyn, p. 55. Ru&s;hworth, vol. i. p. 31, 32, &amp;c.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>ENCOURAGED by this &s;ucce&s;s, the commons carried
their &s;crutiny, and &s;till with a re&s;pectful hand, into other
abu&s;es of great importance. The &s;eals were, at that time,
in the keeping of the celebrated Bacon, created Vi&s;count St.
Albans; a man univer&s;ally admired for the greatne&s;s of his
genius, and beloved for the courteou&s;ne&s;s and humanity of
his behaviour. He was the great ornament of his age and
nation; and nought was wanting to render him the orna|ment
of human nature it&s;elf, but that &s;trength of mind,
which might check his intemperate de&s;ire of preferment,
that could add nothing to his dignity, and re&s;train his pro|fu&s;e
inclination to expence, that could be requi&s;ite neither
for his honour nor entertainment. His want of oeconomy
and his indulgence to &s;ervants had involved him in nece&s;&s;i|ties;
and, in order to &s;upply his prodigality, he had been
tempted to take bribes, and that in a very open manner,
from &s;uitors in chancery. 'Tis pretended, that notwith|&s;tanding
this enormous abu&s;e, he had &s;till, in the &s;eat of
ju&s;tice, pre&s;erved the integrity of a judge, and had given
ju&s;t decrees again&s;t tho&s;e very per&s;ons from whom he had
received the wages of iniquity. Complaints ro&s;e the louder
on that account, and at la&s;t reached the hou&s;e of commons,
who &s;ent up an impeachment again&s;t him to the peers. The
chancellor, con&s;cious of guilt, deprecated the vengeance of
his judges, and endeavoured, by a general avowal, to e&s;cape
the confu&s;ion of a &s;tricter inquiry. The lords in&s;i&s;ted on a
<PB N="53" REF="67">
particular confe&s;&s;ion of all his corruptions. He acknow|ledged
twenty-eight articles; and was &s;entenced to pay a fine
of 40,000 pounds, to be impri&s;oned in the Tower during
the King's plea&s;ure, to be for ever incapable of any office,
place, or employment; and never again to &s;it in parliament,
or come within the verge of the court.</P>
<P>THIS dreadful &s;entence, dreadful to a man of nice &s;en&s;i|bility
to honour, he &s;urvived five years; and being relea&s;ed,
in a little time, from the Tower, his genius, yet unbroken,
&s;upported it&s;elf amid&s;t involved circum&s;tances and a de|pre&s;&s;ed
&s;pirit, and &s;hone out in literary productions, which
have made his guilt or weakne&s;&s;es be forgotten or overlooked
by po&s;terity. In con&s;ideration of his great merit, the King
remitted his fine, as well as all the other parts of his &s;en|tence,
conferred on him a large pen&s;ion of 1800 pounds a
year, and employed every expedient to alleviate the weight
of his age and misfortunes. And that great philo&s;opher, at
la&s;t, acknowleged with regret, that he had too long neglect|ed
the true ambition of a fine genius; and by plunging into
bu&s;ine&s;s and affairs, which require much le&s;s capacity, but
greater firmne&s;s of mind, than the pur&s;uits of learning, had
expo&s;ed him&s;elf to &s;uch grievous calamities.</P>
<P>THE commons had entertained the idea, that they were
the great patrons of the people, and that the redre&s;s of all
grievances mu&s;t proceed from them; and to this principle
they were chiefly beholden for the regard and con&s;ideration
of the public. In the execution of this office, they now
kept their ears open to complaints of every kind; and they
carried their re&s;earches into many grievances, which, though
of no great importance, could not be touched, without &s;en|&s;ibly
affecting the King and his mini&s;ters. The prerogative
&s;eemed, each moment, to be invaded; the King's authority,
in every article, was di&s;puted; and James, who was willing
to correct the abu&s;es of his power, would not &s;ubmit to
have his power it&s;elf que&s;tioned and denied. After the
<PB N="54" REF="68">
hou&s;e, therefore, had &s;at near &s;ix months, and had, as yet,
brought no con&s;iderable bu&s;ine&s;s to a full conclu&s;ion, the
King re&s;olved, under pretence of the advanced &s;ea&s;on, to in|terrupt
their proceedings; and he &s;ent them word, that he was
determined, in a very little time, to adjourn them till
next winter. The commons made application to the lords,
and de&s;ired them to join in a petition for delaying the ad|journment;
which was refu&s;ed by the upper hou&s;e. The
King regarded this project of a joint petition as an attempt
to force him from his mea&s;ures: He thanked the peers for
their refu&s;al to concur in it, and told them, that if it was
their de&s;ire, he would delay the adjournment, but would not
&s;o far comply with the reque&s;t of the lower hou&s;e<NOTE N="w" PLACE="foot">Ru&s;hworth, vol. i. p. 35.</NOTE>. And
thus, in the&s;e great national affairs, the &s;ame peevi&s;hne&s;s,
which, in private altercations, often rai&s;es a quarrel from
the &s;malle&s;t beginnings, produced a mutual coldne&s;s and di&s;|gu&s;t
between the King and the commons.</P>
<P>DURING the rece&s;s of parliament, the King u&s;ed every
mea&s;ure to render him&s;elf popular with the nation, and to
appea&s;e the ri&s;ing ill humour of their repre&s;entatives. He
had voluntarily offered to the parliament to circum&s;cribe his
own prerogative, and to abrogate his power of granting any
monopolies for the future. He now recalled all the patents of
that kind, and redre&s;&s;ed every article of grievance, to the
number of thirty-&s;even, which had ever been complained of
in the hou&s;e of commons<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Ru&s;hworth, vol. i. p. 36. Kennet, p. 733.</NOTE>. But he gained not the end,
which he propo&s;ed. The di&s;gu&s;t, which had appeared at
parting, could not &s;o &s;uddenly be di&s;pelled. He had like|wi&s;e
been &s;o imprudent as to commit to pri&s;on Sir Edwin Sandys<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Journ. 1 Dec. 1621.</NOTE>, and Mr. Selden, without any known cau&s;e, be|&s;ides
their activity and vigour, in di&s;charging their duty as
members of parliament. And above all, the tran&s;actions in
Germany were &s;ufficient, when joined to the King's cau|tions,
<PB N="55" REF="69">
negotiations, and delays, to inflame that jealou&s;y of
honour and religion, which prevailed throughout the na|tion<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">To &s;how to what degree the nation was enflamed with regard to the Palatinate, there recurs a remarkable &s;tory this &s;e&s;&s;ion. One Floyd, a pri&s;oner in the Fleet, a catholic, had dropt &s;ome expre&s;&s;ions as if he were plea&s;ed with the misfortunes of the Palatine and his wife. The commons were in a flame; and pretending to be a court of judicatory and of record, proceeded to condemn him to a &s;evere puni&s;hment. The hou&s;e of lords checked this encroachment; and what was extraordinary, con&s;idering the pre&s;ent humour of the lower hou&s;e, they acquie&s;ced in the &s;entiments of the lords. This is almo&s;t the only preten&s;ion of the Engli&s;h commons, in which they have not prevailed. Happily for the nation, they have been &s;ucce&s;sful in almo&s;t all their other claims.

This &s;ummer, the ban of the empire was publi&s;h|ed
again&s;t the Elector Palatine; and the execution of it was
committed to the Duke of Bavaria<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Franklyn, p. 73.</NOTE>. The Upper Palatinate
was, in a little time, conquered by that prince, and mea|&s;ures
were taking in the empire for be&s;towing on him the
electoral dignity, of which the Palatine was de&s;poiled. Fre|deric
now lived with his numerous family, in poverty and
di&s;tre&s;s, either in Holland, or at Sedan with his uncle the
Duke of Bo$illon. And throughout all the new conque&s;ts
in both the Palatinates as well as in Bohemia, Au&s;tria, Lu|&s;atia,
the progre&s;s of the Au&s;trian arms was attended with
rigours and &s;everities, exerci&s;ed again&s;t the profe&s;&s;ors of the
reformed religion.</P>
<P>THE zeal of the commons immediately moved them,<NOTE PLACE="marg">14th of Nov.</NOTE>
upon their a&s;&s;embling, to take all the&s;e tran&s;actions into con|&s;ideration.
They framed a remon&s;trance, which they in|tended
to carry to the King. They repre&s;ented, that the
enormous growth of the Au&s;trian power threatened the liber|ties
of all Europe; that the progre&s;s of the catholic religion
in England bred the mo&s;t melancholy apprehen&s;ions, le&s;t it
&s;hould again acquire an a&s;cendant in the kingdom; that the
indulgence of his Maje&s;ty towards the profe&s;&s;ors of that re|ligion
had encouraged their in&s;olence and temerity; that the
uncontrouled conque&s;ts, made by the Au&s;trian family in
<PB N="56" REF="70">
Germany, rai&s;ed mighty expectations in the Engli&s;h papi&s;ts;
but above all, that the pro&s;pect of the Spani&s;h match ele|vated
them &s;o far as to hope for an intire toleration, if not
a final re-e&s;tabli&s;hment of their religion. The commons,
therefore, entreated his Maje&s;ty, that he would immedi|ately
undertake the defence of the Palatine, and maintain
it by force of arms; that he would turn his &s;word again&s;t
Spain, who&s;e armies and trea&s;ures were the chief &s;upport
of the catholic intere&s;t in Europe; that he would enter into
no negotiation for the marriage of his &s;on but with a pro|te&s;tant
prince&s;s; that the children of popi&s;h recu&s;ants
&s;hould be taken from their parents, and be committed to the
care of prote&s;tant teachers and &s;choolma&s;ters; and that the
fines and confi&s;cations, to which the catholics were by law
liable, &s;hould be levied with the utmo&s;t &s;everity<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Franklyn, p. 58, 59. Ru&s;hworth, vol. i. p. 40, 41. Kennet, p. 737.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BY this <HI>bold</HI> &s;tep, unprecedented in England for many
years, and &s;carce ever heard of in peaceable times, the com|mons
attacked at once all the King's favourite maxims of
government; his cautious and pacific mea&s;ures, his lenity
towards the Romi&s;h religion, and his attachment to the Spa|ni&s;h
alliance, from which he promi&s;ed him&s;elf &s;uch mighty
advantages. But what mo&s;t di&s;gu&s;ted him was, their &s;eem|ing
inva&s;ion of his prerogative, and their pretending, under
colour of advice, to direct his conduct in &s;uch tran&s;actions,
as had ever been acknowleged to belong &s;olely to the ma|nagement
and direction of the &s;overeign. He was, at that
time, ab&s;ent at Newmarket; but &s;o &s;oon as he heard of the
intended remon&s;trance of the commons, he wrote a letter
to the &s;peaker, in which he &s;harply rebuked the hou&s;e for
debating openly of matters far above their reach and capa|city,
and he &s;trictly forbad them to meddle with any thing,
that regarded his government or deep matters of &s;tate, and
e&s;pecially not to touch on his &s;on's marriage with the daugh|ter
of Spain, nor to attack the honour of that King or any
other of his friends and confederates. In order the more
<PB N="57" REF="71">
to terrify them, he mentioned the impri&s;onment of Sir Ed|win
Sandys; and though he denied, that the confinement
of that member had been owing to any offence committed
in the hou&s;e, yet he plainly told them, that he thought
him&s;elf fully intitled to puni&s;h every mi&s;demeanour in par|liament,
as well during its &s;itting as after its di&s;&s;olution;
and that he intended thenceforward to cha&s;tize any man,
who&s;e in&s;olent behaviour there &s;hould mini&s;ter occa&s;ion of
offence<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Franklyn, p. 60. Ru&s;hworth, vol. i. p. 43. Kennet, p. 741.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THIS <HI>violent</HI> letter, in which the King, though he here
imitated former precedents of Elizabeth, may be thought
not to have acted altogether on the defen&s;ive, had the effect,
which might naturally have been expected from it: The
commons were enflamed, not terrified. Con&s;cious of their
own popularity, and of the bent of the nation towards a
war with the catholics abroad, and the per&s;ecution of popery
at home, they little dreaded the menaces of a prince, who
was un&s;upported by a military force, and who&s;e gentle
temper would, of it&s;elf, &s;o &s;oon di&s;arm his &s;everity. In a
new remon&s;trance, therefore, they &s;till in&s;i&s;ted on their
former remon&s;trance and advice; and they maintained,
though in re&s;pectful terms, that they were intitled to inter|po&s;e
with their council in all matters of government; that
it was their antient and undoubted right, and an inheritance
tran&s;mitted to them from their ance&s;tors, to po&s;&s;e&s;s intire
freedom of &s;peech in their debates of public bu&s;ine&s;s; and
that, if any member abu&s;ed this liberty, it belonged to the
hou&s;e alone, who were witne&s;&s;es of his offence, to inflict a
proper cen&s;ure upon him<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Franklyn p. 60. Ru&s;hworth, vol. i. p. 44. Kennet, p. 741.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>So <HI>vigorous</HI> an an&s;wer was no wi&s;e calculated to appea&s;e
the King. 'Tis &s;aid, when the approach of the committee,
who were to pre&s;ent it, was notified to him, he ordered
twelve chairs to be brought: For that there were &s;o many
<PB N="58" REF="72">
kings a coming<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Kennet, p. 743.</NOTE>. His an&s;wer was prompt and &s;harp. He
told the hou&s;e, that their remon&s;trance was more like a de|nunciation
of war than an addre&s;s of dutiful &s;ubjects; that
their preten&s;ion to inquire into all &s;tate-affairs, without ex|ception,

to indulge him&s;elf in political rea&s;onings and inquiries; and
the &s;ame factions, which commenced in parliament, were
propagated throughout the nation. In vain did James,
by re-iterated proclamations, forbid the di&s;cour&s;ing of &s;tate
affairs<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Franklyn, p. 56. Ru&s;hworth, vol. i. p. 21, 36, 55. The King al&s;o, in imitation of his predece&s;&s;ors, gave rules to preachers. Franklyn, p. 70.

rather to inflame the curio&s;ity of the public. And in every
company or &s;ociety, the late tran&s;actions became the &s;ubject
of argument and debate.</P>
<P>ALL hi&s;tory, &s;aid the partizans of the court, as well as
the hi&s;tory of England, ju&s;tify the King's po&s;ition with
regard to the origin of popular privileges; and every rea|&s;onable
man mu&s;t allow, that, as monarchy is the mo&s;t
&s;imple form of government, it mu&s;t fir&s;t have occurred to
rude and unin&s;tructed mankind. The other complicated
and artificial additions were the &s;ucce&s;&s;ive invention of
&s;overeigns and legi&s;lators; or, if they were obtruded on
the prince by &s;editious &s;ubjects, their origin mu&s;t appear,
on that account, &s;till more precarious and unfavourable. In
England, the authority of the King, in all the exterior
forms of government and in the common &s;tyle of law, ap|pears
totally ab&s;olute and &s;overeign; nor does the real &s;pirit
of the con&s;titution, as it has ever di&s;covered it&s;elf in prac|tice,
fall much &s;hort of the&s;e appearances. The parlia|ment
is created by his will; by his will it is di&s;&s;olved. 'Tis
his will alone, though at the de&s;ire of both hou&s;es, which
gives authority to laws. To all foreign nations, the ma|je&s;ty
of monarch &s;eems to merit &s;ole attention and regard.
And no &s;ubject, who has expo&s;ed him&s;elf to royal indig|nation,
can propo&s;e to live with &s;afety in the kingdom; nor
can he even leave it, according to law, without the con&s;ent
<PB N="62" REF="76">
of his ma&s;ter. If a magi&s;trate, invironed with &s;uch power
and &s;plendor, &s;hould con&s;ider his authority as &s;acred, and
regard him&s;elf as the anointed of heaven, his preten&s;ions
may bear a very favourable con&s;truction. Or, allowing
them to be merely pious frauds, we need not be &s;urprized,
that the &s;ame &s;tratagem, which was practi&s;ed by Minos,
Numa, and the mo&s;t celebrated legi&s;lators of antiquity,
&s;hould now, in the&s;e re&s;tle&s;s and inqui&s;itive times, be em|ployed
by the King of England. Subjects are not rai&s;ed
above that quality, though a&s;&s;embled in parliament. The
&s;ame humble re&s;pect and deference is &s;till due to their prince.
Though he indulges them in the privilege of laying before
him their dome&s;tic grievances, with which they are &s;uppo&s;ed
to be be&s;t acquainted, this warrants not their bold intru&s;ion
into each province of government. And, to every judici|ous
examiner, it mu&s;t appear, &startq;That the lines of duty
are as much tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed by a more independent and le&s;s
re&s;pectful exerci&s;e of acknowleged powers, as by the
u&s;urpation of &s;uch as are new and unu&s;ual.&endq;</P>
<P>THE lovers of liberty, throughout the nation, rea&s;oned
after a very different manner. 'Tis in vain, &s;aid they, that
the King traces up the Engli&s;h government to its fir&s;t origin,
in order to repre&s;ent the privileges of parliament as depend|ent
and precarious: The pre&s;cription and practice of &s;o
many ages, mu&s;t, long ere this time, have given a &s;anction
to the&s;e a&s;&s;emblies, even though they had been derived from
an origin no more dignified, than that which he a&s;&s;igns
them. If the written records of the Engli&s;h nation, as a&s;&s;erted,
repre&s;ent parliaments to have ari&s;en from the con|&s;ent
of monarchs, the principles of human nature, when
we trace government a &s;tep higher, mu&s;t &s;how us, that
monarchs them&s;elves owe all their authority to the volun|tary
&s;ubmi&s;&s;ion of the people. But, infact, no age can be
&s;hown, when the Engli&s;h government was altogether an un|mixed
<PB N="63" REF="77">
monarchy: And if the privileges of the nation have,
at any particular period, been overpowered by violent ir|ruptions
of foreign force or dome&s;tic u&s;urpation; the ge|nerous
&s;pirit of the people has ever &s;eized the fir&s;t opportu|nity
of re-e&s;tabli&s;hing the antient government and con&s;titu|tion.
Though in the &s;tyle of the laws, and in the u&s;ual
forms of admini&s;tration, the royal authority may be repre|&s;ented
as &s;acred and &s;upreme; whatever is e&s;&s;ential to the
exerci&s;e of &s;overeign and legi&s;lative power, mu&s;t &s;till be re|garded
as equally divine and inviolable. Or, if any di&s;|tinction
be made in this re&s;pect, the preference is rather due
to tho&s;e national councils, by who&s;e interpo&s;ition the exor|bitancies
of tyrannical power are re&s;trained, and that &s;acred
liberty is pre&s;erved, which heroic &s;pirits, in all ages, have
deemed more precious than life it&s;elf. Nor is it &s;ufficient to &s;ay,
that the mild and equitable admini&s;tration of James, affords
little occa&s;ion, or no occa&s;ion, of complaint. However
moderate the exerci&s;e of his prerogative, however exact his
ob&s;ervance of the laws and con&s;titution; &startq;If he founds his
authority on arbitrary and dangerous principles, it is re|qui&s;ite
to watch him with equal care, and to oppo&s;e him
with equal vigour, as if he had indulged him&s;elf in all
the exce&s;&s;es of cruelty and tyranny.&endq;</P>
<P>AMIDST all the&s;e di&s;putes, the wife and moderate in the
nation endeavoured to pre&s;erve as much as po&s;&s;ible, an
equitable neutrality between the oppo&s;ite parties; and the
more they reflected on the cour&s;e of public affairs, the
greater difficulty they found of fixing ju&s;t &s;entiments with
regard to them. On the one hand, they regarded the very
ri&s;e of oppo&s;ite parties as a happy progno&s;tic of the e&s;ta|bli&s;hment
of liberty; nor could they ever expect to enjoy,
in a mixed government, &s;o invaluable a ble&s;&s;ing, without
&s;uffering that inconvenience, which, in &s;uch governments, has
ever attended it. But, when they con&s;idered, on the other
hand, the nece&s;&s;ary aims and pur&s;uits of both parties, they
<PB N="64" REF="78">
were &s;truck with apprehen&s;ion of the con&s;equences, and
could di&s;cover no fea&s;ible plan of accommodation between
them. From long practice, the crown was now po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed
of &s;o exorbitant a prerogative, that it was not &s;ufficient for
liberty to remain on the defen&s;ive, or endeavour to &s;ecure
the little ground, which was left her: It was become nece&s;|&s;ary
to carry on an offen&s;ive war, and to circum&s;cribe, within
more narrow, as well as more exact bounds, the authority
of the &s;overeign. Upon &s;uch provocation, it could not but
happen, that the prince, however ju&s;t and moderate, would
endeavour to repre&s;s his opponents; and, as he &s;tood upon
the very brink of arbitrary power, it was to be feared,
that he would, ha&s;tily and unknowingly, pa&s;s tho&s;e limits,
which were not preci&s;ely marked by the con&s;titution. The
turbulent government of England, ever $luctuating between
privilege and prerogative, would afford a variety of prece|dents,
which might be pleaded on both &s;ides. In &s;uch deli|cate
que&s;tions, the people mu&s;t be divided: The arms of
the &s;tate were &s;till in their hands: A civil war mu&s;t en&s;ue;
a civil war, where no party or both parties would ju&s;tly bear
the blame, and where the good and virtuous would &s;carce
know what vows to $orm; were it not that liberty, $o n$|ce&s;&s;ary
to the per$ection of human &s;ociety, would be &s;uffi|cient
to bya&s;s their a$fections towards the &s;ide of its de|fenders.</P>

and the commons. The King's negotiations, therefore,
had they been managed with ever &s;o great dexterity, mu&s;t
now carry le$s weight with them; and it was ea&s;y to elude
all his applications. When Lord Digby, his amba&s;&s;ador to
the Emperor, had de&s;ired a ce&s;&s;ation of ho&s;tilities, he was
referred to the Duke of Bavaria, who commanded the Au|&s;trian

time,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. XLIX.</NOTE> under that of the Infanta: When the con$erences
were entered upon, it was found, that the powers of the&s;e
princes to determine in the controver&s;y were not &s;ufficient
nor &s;atis$actory. Schwartzenbourg, the imperial mini&s;ter,
was expected at London; and it was hoped, that he would
bring more ample authority: His commi&s;&s;ion referred in|tirely
to the negotiation at Bru&s;&s;els. It was not di$ficult for
the King to perceive, that his applications were purpo&s;ely
eluded by the Emperor; but as he had no choice of any
other expedient, and it &s;eemed the intere&s;t of his &s;on-in-law
to keep alive his preten&s;ions, he was &s;till contented to
follow Ferdinand thro' all his &s;hi$ts and eva&s;ions. Nor
was he intirely di&s;couraged, even when the imperial diet at
Rati&s;bon, by the influence, or rather authority of the Em|peror,
tho' contrary to the prote&s;tation of Saxony and all
the prote&s;tant princes and cities, had transferred the elec|toral
dignity from the Palatine to the Duke of Bavaria.</P>
<P>MEAN while the efforts made by Frederic, for the reco|very
of his dominions, were vigorous. Three armies were
levied in Germany by his authority, under three com|manders,
Duke Chri&s;tian of Brun&s;wick, the Prince of
Baden-Dourlach, and Count Mans$eldt. The two former
generals were defeated by Count Tilly and the Imperiali&s;ts:
The third, tho' much inferior in force to his enemies, &s;till
maintained the war; but with no equal &s;upplies of money
either from the Palatine or the King of England. It was
chiefly by pillage and free quarters in the Palatinate, that
he &s;ub&s;i&s;ted his army. As the Au&s;trians were regularly
paid, they were kept in more exact di&s;cipline; and James
became ju&s;tly apprehen&s;ive, le&s;t &s;o unequal a conte&s;t, be&s;ides
ravaging the Palatine's hereditary dominions, would end in
the total alienation of the people from their antient &s;ove|reign,
by whom they were plundered, and in an attach|ment
to their new ma&s;ters, by whom they were protected<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Parl. Hi&s;t. vol. v. p. 484.</NOTE>.
<PB N="67" REF="83">
He therefore wi&s;ely per&s;uaded his &s;on-in-law to di&s;arm, under
colour of duty and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the Emperor: And accord|ingly,
Mansfeldt was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from the Palatine's &s;ervice;
and that famous general withdrew his army into the Low
Countries, and there received a commi&s;&s;ion from the &s;tates
of the United Provinces.</P>
<P>To &s;hew how little account was made of James's nego|tiations
abroad, there is a plea&s;antry which is mentioned by
all hi&s;torians, and which, for that rea&s;on, &s;hall have place
here. In a farce, acted at Bru&s;&s;els, a courier was intro|duced
carrying the doleful news, that the Palatinate would
&s;oon be wre&s;ted from the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria; &s;o powerful
were the &s;uccours, which, from all quarters, were ha&s;tening
to the relief of the de&s;poiled Elector: The King of Den|mark
had agreed to contribute to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance a hundred
thou&s;and pickled herrings, the Dutch a hundred thou&s;and
butter-boxes, and the King of England a hundred thou&s;and
amba&s;&s;adors. On other occa&s;ions, he was painted with a
&s;cabbard, but without a &s;word; or with a &s;word which no|body
could draw, though &s;everal were pulling at it<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Kennet, p. 749.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IT was not from his negotiations with the Emperor or
the Duke of Bavaria, that James expected any &s;ucce&s;s in
his project of re&s;toring the Palatine: His eyes were intirely
turned towards Spain; and if he could effectuate his &s;on's
marriage with the Infanta, he doubted not, but that, after
&s;o intimate a conjunction, this other point could ea&s;ily be
obtained. The negotiations of that court being naturally
dilatory, it was not ea&s;y for a prince of &s;o little penetration in
bu&s;ine&s;s, to di&s;tingui&s;h whether the difficulties which occurred
were real or affected; and he was &s;urprized, after negotiate|ing
five years on &s;o &s;imple a demand, that he was not more
advanced than at the beginning. The di&s;pen&s;ation of Rome
was requi&s;ite for the marriage of the Infanta with a prote&s;t|ant
<PB N="68" REF="84">
prince; and the King of Spain, having undertaken to
procure that di&s;pen&s;ation, had thereby acquired the means
of retarding at plea&s;ure, or of forwarding the marriage,
and at the &s;ame time of concealing intirely his artifices from
the court of England.</P>
<P>IN order to remove all ob&s;tacles, James di&s;patched Digby,
&s;oon afterwards created Earl of Bri&s;tol, as his amba&s;&s;ador
to Philip IV. who had lately &s;ucceeded his father in the
crown of Spain. He &s;ecretly employed Gage as his agent
at Rome; and finding that the difference of religion was
the principal, if not &s;ole difficulty which retarded the mar|riage,
he re&s;olved to &s;often that objection as much as po&s;|&s;ible.
He i&s;&s;ued public orders for di&s;charging all popi&s;h
recu&s;ants who were impri&s;oned; and it was daily appre|hended,
that he would forbid, for the future, the execution
of the penal laws enacted again&s;t them. For this &s;tep, &s;o
oppo&s;ite to the rigid &s;pirit of his &s;ubjects, he took care to
apologize; and he even endeavoured to a&s;cribe it to his
great zeal for the reformed religion. He had been making
applications, he &s;aid, to all foreign princes for &s;ome indulg|ence
to the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed prote&s;tants; and he was &s;till an&s;wered
by objections derived from the &s;everity of the Engli&s;h laws
again&s;t catholics<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Franklyn, p. 69. Ru&s;hworth, vol. i. p. 63.</NOTE>. And indeed, it might probably occur
to him, that, if the extremity of religious zeal was ever to

to have led the way in &s;entiments &s;o wi&s;e and moderate.</P>
<P>NOT only the religious puritans murmured at this tole|rating
mea&s;ure of the King: The lovers of civil liberty
were alarmed at &s;o important an exertion of his prerogative.
But, among other dangerous articles of authority, the
Kings of England were at that time po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the di&s;pen&s;|ing
power; at lea&s;t, were in the con&s;tant practice of exer|cising
it. Be&s;ides, tho' the royal prerogative in civil mat|ters
<PB N="69" REF="85">
was then exorbitant, the princes, during &s;ome late
reigns, had been accu&s;tomed to a&s;&s;ume &s;till higher in eccle|&s;ia&s;tical.
And the King failed not to repre&s;ent the tolera|tion
of catholics as a mea&s;ure intirely of that nature.</P>
<P>BY James's conce&s;&s;ion in favour of the catholics, he ob|tained
his end. The &s;ame religious motives, which had hi|therto
rendered the court of Madrid in&s;incere in all the &s;teps
taken with regard to the marriage, were now the chief
cau&s;e of promoting it. By its means, it was there hoped
the Engli&s;h catholics would for the future enjoy ea&s;e and
indulgence; and the Infanta would be the happy in&s;trument
of procuring to the church &s;ome tranquillity, after the
many &s;evere per&s;ecutions which it had hitherto undergone.
The Earl of Bri&s;tol, a mini&s;ter of vigilance and penetration,
and who had formerly oppo&s;ed all alliance with catholics<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Ru&s;h. vol. i. p. 292.</NOTE>,
was now fully convinced of the &s;incerity of Spain; and he
was ready to congratulate the King on the intire completion
of all his views and projects<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Ibid. vol. i. p. 69.</NOTE>. A daughter of Spain, whom
he repre&s;ents as extremely accompli&s;hed, would &s;oon, he
&s;aid, arrive in England, and bring with her an immen&s;e
fortune of two millions<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">It ap|pears by Buckingham's narrative, that the&s;e two millions were of pieces of eight, and made 600,000 pounds &s;terling: A very great &s;um, and almo&s;t equal to all the &s;ums which the parliament, during the whole cour&s;e of this reign, had hitherto be&s;towed on the King.</NOTE>, a &s;um four times greater than
Spain had ever before given with any prince&s;s. But what
was of more importance to the King's honour and happi|ne&s;s,
Bri&s;tol con&s;idered this match as an infallible progno|&s;tic
of the Palatine's re&s;toration; nor would Philip, he
thought, ever have be&s;towed his &s;i&s;ter and &s;o large a for|tune,
under the pro&s;pect of entering next day into a war
with England. So exact was his intelligence, that the mo&s;t

However little calculated James's character to
extort &s;o va&s;t a conce&s;&s;ion; however improper the meafures
which he had pur&s;ued for obtaining that end; the amba&s;|&s;ador
could not with&s;tand the plain evidence of facts, by
which Philip now demon&s;trated his &s;incerity. Perhaps too,
like a wi&s;e man, he con&s;idered that rea&s;ons of &s;tate, which
are &s;uppo&s;ed &s;olely to influence the councils of monarchs,
are not always the motives which there predominate; that
the milder views of gratitude, honour, friend&s;hip, genero|&s;ity,
are frequently able, among princes as well as private
per&s;ons, to counterbalance the&s;e &s;elfi&s;h con&s;iderations; that
the ju&s;tice and moderation of James had been &s;o con&s;picuous
in all the&s;e tran&s;actions, his reliance on Spain, his confidence
in her friend&s;hip, that he had at la&s;t obtained the cordial
alliance of that nation, &s;o celebrated for honour and fidelity.
Or if politics mu&s;t &s;till be &s;uppo&s;ed the ruling motive of all
public mea&s;ures, the maritime power of England was &s;o
great, the Spani&s;h dominions &s;o divided, as might well in|duce
the council of Philip to think that a &s;incere friend&s;hip
with the ma&s;ters of the &s;ea could not be purcha&s;ed by too
many conce&s;&s;ions<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Franklyn, p. 72.</NOTE>. And as James, during &s;o many years,
had been allured and &s;educed by hopes and prote&s;tations, his
people enraged by delays and di&s;appointments; it would
probably occur, that there was now no medium left between
the mo&s;t inveterate hatred and the mo&s;t intimate alliance be|twixt
the nations. Not to mention, that, as a new &s;pirit
began about this time to animate the councils of France, the
friend&s;hip of England became every day more nece&s;&s;ary to
the greatne&s;s and &s;ecurity of the Spani&s;h monarchy.</P>

ALL mea&s;ures being, therefore, agreed between the par|ties,
nought was wanting but the di&s;pen&s;ation from Rome,
which might be con&s;idered as a mere formality<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Ru&s;hworth, vol. i. p. 66.</NOTE>. The
King, ju&s;tified by &s;ucce&s;s, now exulted in his pacific coun|&s;els,
and boa&s;ted of his &s;uperior &s;agacity and penetration;
when all the&s;e flattering pro&s;pects were bla&s;ted by the teme|rity
of a man whom he had fondly exalted from a private
condition to be the bane of him&s;elf, of his family, and of
his people.</P>
<P>EVER &s;ince the fall of Somer&s;et,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Character of Bucking|ham.</NOTE> Buckingham had go|verned,
with an uncontroled &s;way, both the court and na|tion;
and could James's eyes have been opened,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1623.</NOTE> he had
now full opportunity of ob&s;erving how unfit his favourite
was for the high &s;tation to which he was rai&s;ed. Some ac|compli&s;hments
of a courtier he po&s;&s;effed: Of every talent of
a mini&s;ter he was utterly devoid. Headlong in his pa&s;&s;ions,
and incapable equally of prudence and of di&s;&s;imulation:
Sincere from violence rather than candor; expen&s;ive from
profu&s;ion more than genero&s;ity: A warm friend, a furious
enemy; but without any choice or di&s;cernment in either:
With the&s;e qualities he had early and quickly mounted to
the highe&s;t rank; and partook at once of the in&s;olence which
attends a fortune newly acquired, and the impetuo&s;ity which
belongs to per&s;ons born in high &s;tations, and unacquainted
with oppo&s;ition.</P>
<P>AMONG tho&s;e who had experienced the arrogance of this
overgrown favourite, the Prince of Wales him&s;elf had not
been intirely &s;pared; and a great coldne&s;s, if not an enmity,
had, for that rea&s;on, taken place between them. Bucking|ham,
de&s;irous of an opportunity which might connect him
with the Prince, and overcome his aver&s;ion, and at the &s;ame
time envious of the great credit acquired by Bri&s;tol in the
Spani&s;h negotiation, bethought him&s;elf of an expedient, by
<PB N="72" REF="90">
which he might at once gratify both the&s;e inclinations. He
repre&s;ented to Charles, That per&s;ons of his exalted &s;tation
were peculiarly unfortunate in their marriage, the chief cir|cum&s;tance
in life; and commonly received into their arms
a bride, unknown to them, to whom they were unknown;
not endeared by &s;ympathy, not obliged by &s;ervices; wooed
by treaties alone, by negotiations, by political intere&s;ts: That
however accompli&s;hed the Infanta, &s;he mu&s;t &s;till con&s;ider
her&s;elf as a melancholy victim of &s;tate, and could not but
think with aver&s;ion of that day when &s;he was to enter the
bed of a &s;tranger; and pa&s;&s;ing into a foreign country and
a new family, bid adieu for ever to her father's hou&s;e and to
her native land: That it was in the Prince's power to
&s;often all the&s;e rigours, and lay &s;uch an obligation on her, as
would attach the mo&s;t indifferent temper, as would warm
the colde&s;t affections: That his journey to Madrid would
be an unexpected gallantry, which would equal all the
fictions of Spani&s;h romance, and &s;uiting the amorous and
enterpri&s;ing character of that nation, mu&s;t immediately in|troduce
him to the Prince&s;s under the agreeable character of
a devoted lover and daring adventurer: That the negotia|tions
with regard to the Palatinate, which had hitherto lan|gui&s;hed
in the hands of mini&s;ters, would quickly be termi|nated
by &s;o illu&s;trious an agent, &s;econded by the mediation
and intreaties of the grateful Infanta: That the Spani&s;h
genero&s;ity, moved by that unexampled tru&s;t and confidence,
would make conce&s;&s;ions beyond what could be expected
from political views and con&s;iderations: And that he would
quickly return to the King with the glory of having re|e&s;tabli&s;hed
the unhappy Palatine, by the &s;ame enterprize
which procured him the affections and the per&s;on of the
Spani&s;h Prince&s;s<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Clarendon, vol. i. p. 11, 12.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE mind of the young prince, replete with candor,
was inflamed by the&s;e generous and romantic ideas. He
<PB N="73" REF="91">
agreed to make application to the King for his approbation.
They cho&s;e the moment of his kinde&s;t and mo&s;t jovial hu|mour;
and more by the earne&s;tne&s;s which they expre&s;&s;ed,
than by the force of their rea&s;ons, they obtained a ha&s;ty
and unguarded con&s;ent to their undertaking. And having
engaged his promi&s;e to keep their purpo&s; &s;ecret, they left
him, in order to make preparations for their journey.</P>
<P>No &s;ooner was the King alone, than his temper, more
cautious than &s;anguine, &s;ugge&s;ted very different views of
the matter, and repre&s;ented every difficulty and danger
which could occur. He reflected, that, however the world
might pardon this &s;ally of youth in the Prince, they would
never forgive him&s;elf, who at his years, and after his expe|rience,
could entru&s;t his only &s;on, the heir of his crown,
the prop of his age, to the di&s;cretion of foreigners, with|out
&s;o much as providing the frail &s;ecurity of a &s;afe conduct
in his favour: That, if the Spani&s;h monarch was &s;incere in
his profe&s;&s;ions, a few months mu&s;t fini&s;h the treaty of mar|riage,
and bring the Infanta into England; if he was not
&s;incere, the folly was &s;till more egregious of committing the
Prince into his hands: That Philip, when po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;o
invaluable a pledge, might well ri&s;e in his demands, and im|po&s;e
harder conditions of treaty: And that the temerity of
this enterprize was &s;o apparent, that the event, however
pro&s;perous, could never ju&s;tify it; and if di&s;a&s;trous, it would
render him&s;elf infamous to his people, and ridiculous to all
po&s;terity<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Clarendon, vol. i. p. 14.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>TORMENTED with the&s;e reflections, &s;o &s;oon as the
Prince and Buckingham returned for their di&s;patches, he in|formed
them of all the rea&s;ons which had determined him
to change his re&s;olution; and he begged them to de&s;i&s;t
from &s;o fooli&s;h an adventure. The Prince received the di&s;|appointment
with &s;orrowful &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion and &s;ilent tears:
Buckingham pre&s;umed to &s;peak in an imperious tone, which
<PB N="74" REF="92">
he had ever experienced to be prevalent over his too ea&s;y ma&s;ter.
He told the King, that nobody for the future
would believe any thing he &s;aid, when he retracted &s;o &s;oon
the promi&s;e &s;o &s;olemnly given; that he plainly di&s;cerned
this change of re&s;olution to proceed from another breach of
his word, in communicating the matter to &s;ome ra&s;cal, who
had furni&s;hed him with tho&s;e pitiful rea&s;ons which he had
alleged, and he doubted not but he &s;hould hereafter know
who his coun&s;ellor had been; and that if he receded from
what he had promi&s;ed, it would be &s;uch a di&s;obligation to
the Prince, who had now &s;et his heart upon the journey,
after his Maje&s;ty's approbation, that he could never forget
it, nor forgive any man who had been the cau&s;e of it<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Clarendon, vol. i. p. 16.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE King with great earne&s;tne&s;s, fortified by many
oaths, made his apology, by denying that he had communi|cated
the matter to any man; and finding him&s;elf a&s;&s;ailed,
as well by the boi&s;terous importunities of Buckingham, as
by the warm entreaties of his &s;on, who&s;e applications had
hitherto, on other occa&s;ions, been always dutiful, never
earne&s;t; he had again the weakne&s;s to a&s;&s;ent to their pur|po&s;ed
journey. It was agreed that Sir Francis Cottington
alone, the Prince's &s;ecretary, and Endymion Porter, gentle|man
of his bed-chamber, &s;hould accompany them; and the
former being at that time in the anti-chamber, he was im|mediately
called in by the King's orders.</P>
<P>JAMES told Cottington, that he had always been an ho|ne&s;t
man, and therefore he was now to tru&s;t him in an
affair of the highe&s;t importance, which he was not, upon
his life, to di&s;clo&s;e to any man whatever. &startq;Cottington,&endq;
added he, &startq;here is baby Charles and Stenny&endq; (the&s;e ridi|culous
appellations he u&s;ually gave to the Prince and Buck|ingham)
&startq;who have a great mind to go po&s;t into Spain,
and fetch home the Infanta: They will have but two
more in their company, and have cho&s;en you for one
<PB N="75" REF="93">
What think you of the journey?&endq; Sir Francis, who
was a prudent man, and had re&s;ided &s;ome years in Spain as
the King's agent, was &s;truck with all the obvious objections
to &s;uch an enterprize, and &s;crupled not to declare them.
The King threw him&s;elf upon his bed, and cried, <HI>I told
you this before;</HI> and fell into new pa&s;&s;ion and lamentation,
complaining that he was undone, and &s;hould lo&s;e baby
Charles.</P>
<P>THE Prince &s;howed by his countenance, that he was ex|tremely
di&s;&s;atisfied with Cottington's di&s;cour&s;e; but Buck|ingham
broke into an open pa&s;&s;ion again&s;t him. The King,
he told him, a&s;ked him only of the journey and of the
manner of travelling; particulars, of which he might be a
competent judge, having gone the road &s;o often by po&s;t;
but that he, without being called to it, had the pre&s;ump|tion
to give his advice upon matters of &s;tate and again&s;t his
ma&s;ter, which he &s;hould repent &s;o long as he lived. A thou|&s;and
other reproaches he added, which put the poor King
into a new agony in behalf of a &s;ervant, who, he fore&s;aw,
would &s;uffer for an&s;wering him hone&s;tly. Upon which he
&s;aid with &s;ome commotion: <HI>Nay, by God, Stenny, you are
much to blame for u&s;ing him &s;o: He an&s;wered me directly
to the que&s;tion which I a&s;ked him, and very hone&s;tly and
wi&s;ely; and yet, you know, he &s;aid no more than I told you
before he was called in.</HI> However, after all this pa&s;&s;ion on
both &s;ides, James renewed his con&s;ent; and proper direc|tions
were given for the journey. Nor was he now at any
lo&s;s to di&s;cover that the whole intrigue was originally con|trived
by Buckingham, as well as pur&s;ued violently by his
&s;pirit and impetuo&s;ity.</P>
<P>THESE circum&s;tances, which &s;o well characterize the
per&s;ons, &s;eem to have been related by Cottington to Lord
Clarendon, from whom they are here tran&s;cribed; and tho'
minute, are not unde&s;erving of a place in hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>THE Prince and Buckingham, with their two attendants,
and Sir Richard Graham, ma&s;ter of hor&s;e to Buckingham,
<PB N="76" REF="94">
pa&s;&s;ed di&s;gui&s;ed and undi&s;covered thro' France; and they
even ventured into a court-ball at Paris,<NOTE PLACE="marg">7th March.</NOTE> where Charles &s;aw
the Prince&s;s Henrietta,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Prince's journey to Spain.</NOTE> whom he afterwards e&s;pou&s;ed, and
who was at that time in the bloom of youth and beauty.
In eleven days after their departure from London, they ar|rived
at Madrid; and &s;urprized every-body by a &s;tep &s;o little
u&s;ual among great princes. The Spani&s;h monarch imme|diately
paid Charles a vi&s;it, expre&s;&s;ed the utmo&s;t gratitude
for the confidence repo&s;ed in him, and made warm prote&s;ta|tions
of a corre&s;pondent confidence and friend&s;hip. By the
mo&s;t &s;tudied civilities, he &s;howed the re&s;pect which he bore
his royal gue&s;t. He gave him a golden key, which opened
all his apartments, that the Prince might, without any intro|duction,
have acce&s;s to him at all hours: He took the left
hand of him on every occa&s;ion, except in the apartments
a&s;&s;igned to Charles; for there, he &s;aid, the Prince was at
home: Charles was introduced into the palace with the &s;ame
pomp and ceremony which attend the kings of Spain on
their coronation: The council received public orders to
obey him as the King him&s;elf: Olivarez him&s;elf, though a
grandee of Spain, who are always covered before their own
king, would not put on his hat in the Prince's pre&s;ence<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Franklyn, p. 73.</NOTE>:
All the pri&s;ons of Spain were thrown open, and all the pri|&s;oners
received their freedom, as if the event, the mo&s;t ho|nourable
and mo&s;t fortunate, had happened to the mon|archy<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Idem, p. 74.</NOTE>. And every &s;umptuary law with regard to apparel
was &s;u&s;pended during his re&s;idence in Spain. The Infanta,
however, was only &s;hown to her lover in public; the Spa|ni&s;h
ideas of decency being &s;o &s;trict, as not to allow of any
more intercour&s;e till the arrival of the di&s;pen&s;ation<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Ru&s;hworth, vol. i. p. 77.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE point of honour was carried &s;o far by that gene|rous
people, that no attempt was made, on account of the
advantage which they had acquired, of impo&s;ing any harder
conditions of treaty: Their pious zeal only prompted them,
<PB N="77" REF="95">
on one occa&s;ion, to de&s;ire more conce&s;&s;ions in the rellgious
articles; but, on the oppo&s;ition of Bri&s;tol, accompanied
with &s;ome reproaches, they immediately de&s;i&s;ted. The
Pope, however, hearing of the Prince's arrival in Madrid,
tacked &s;ome new clau&s;es to the di&s;pen&s;ation<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Ru&s;hworth, vol. i. p. 84.</NOTE>; and it be|came
nece&s;&s;ary to tran&s;mit the articles to London, that the
King might there ratify them. This treaty, which was
made public, con&s;i&s;ted of &s;everal articles, chiefly regarding
the exerci&s;e of the catholic religion by the Infanta and her
family. Nothing could rea&s;onably be found fault with,
except one article, in which the King promi&s;ed, that the
children &s;hould be educated by the Prince&s;s, till ten years
of age. This condition could not be in&s;i&s;ted on, but with
a view of &s;ea&s;oning their minds with catholic prejudices;
and tho' &s;o tender an age &s;eemed little &s;u&s;ceptible of theo|logical
tenets, yet the &s;ame rea&s;on, which made the Pope
in&s;ert that article, &s;hould have induced the King to re|ject
it.</P>
<P>BESIDES the public treaty, there, were &s;eparate articles,
privately &s;worn to by the King; in which he promi&s;ed
to &s;u&s;pend the penal laws enacted again&s;t catholics, to pro|cure
a repeal of them in parliament, and to grant a toleration
for the exerci&s;e of the catholic religion in private hou&s;es<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Franklyn, p. 80. Ru&s;hworth, vol. i. p. 89. Kennet, p. 769.</NOTE>.
Great murmurs, we may believe, would have ari&s;en again&s;t
the&s;e articles, had they been made known to the public;
&s;ince we find it to have been imputed as an enormous crime
to the Prince, that, having received, about this time, a very
civil letter from the Pope, he was induced to return a very
civil an&s;wer<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Ru&s;hworth, vol. i. p. 82. Franklyn, p. 77.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>MEAN while Gregory XV. who granted the di&s;pen|&s;ation,
died; and Urban VIII. was cho&s;en in his place.
Upon this event, the nuncio refu&s;ed to deliver the di&s;pen|&s;ation,
till it &s;hould be renewed by Urban; and that crafty
<PB N="78" REF="96">
pontiff delayed the &s;ending a new di&s;pen&s;ation, in hopes,
that, during the Prince's re&s;idence in Spain, &s;ome expedient
might be fallen upon to operate his conver&s;ion. The King
of England, as well as the Prince, became impatient,
On the fir&s;t hint, Charles obtained permi&s;&s;ion to return;
and Philip graced his departure with all the circum&s;tances of
elaborate civility and re&s;pect, which had attended his ar|rival.
He even erected a pillar, on the &s;pot where they
took leave of each other, as a monument of mutual friend|&s;hip:
and the Prince, having &s;worn to the ob&s;ervance of
all the articles, entered on his journey, and embarked on
board the Engli&s;h fleet at St. Andero.</P>
<P>THE character of Charles, compo&s;ed of decency, re|&s;erve,
mode&s;ty, &s;obriety; virtues &s;o agreeable to the man|ners
of the Spaniards; the unparalleled confidence, which
he had repo&s;ed in their nation; the romantic gallantry,
which he had practifed towards their prince&s;s; all the&s;e cir|cum&s;tances,
joined to his youth and advantageous figure,
had endeared him to the whole court of Madrid, and had
impre&s;&s;ed the mo&s;t favourable ideas of him<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Franklyn, p. 80. Ru&s;hworth, vol. i. p. 103.</NOTE>. But, in the
&s;ame proportion, that the Prince was beloved and e&s;teemed,
was Buckingham de&s;pi&s;ed and hated. His behaviour, com|po&s;ed
of Engli&s;h familiarity and French vivacity; his &s;allies
of pa&s;&s;ion, his indecent freedoms with the Prince, his di&s;|&s;olute
plea&s;ures, his arrogant, impetuous temper, which he
neither could, nor cared to di&s;gui&s;e; qualities like the&s;e,
could, mo&s;t of them, be e&s;teemed no where, but to the
Spaniards were the objects of peculiar aver&s;ion<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Ru&s;hworth, vol. i. p. 101.</NOTE>. They
could not conceal their &s;urprize, that &s;uch a youth could in|trude
into a negotiation, now conducted to a period, by &s;o
accompli&s;hed a mini&s;ter as Bri&s;tol, and could a&s;&s;ume to him|&s;elf

<P>THE Duke of Buckingham told Olivarez, that his own

was extreme; that he would contribute to every mea&s;ure,
which could cement the friend&s;hip between England and

<P>BUCKINGHAM, &s;en&s;ible how odious he was become to
the Spaniards, and dreading the influence which that na|tion
would naturally acquire after the arrival of the
In&s;anta, re&s;olved to employ all his credit, in order to prevent the
marriage. By what arguments he could engage the Prince
to offer &s;uch an in&s;ult to the Spani&s;h nation, from whom he
had met with &s;uch generous treatment; by what colours he
could di&s;gui&s;e the ingratitude, and imprudence of &s;uch a
mea&s;ure; the&s;e are totally unknown to us. It only appears,
that his impetuous and domineering character had acquired,
what it ever after maintained, a total a&s;cendant over the
gentle and mode&s;t temper of Charles; and, when the
Prince left Madrid, he was firmly determined, notwith|&s;tanding
all his profe&s;&s;ions, to break off the treaty with Spain.</P>
<P>IT is not likely, that Buckingham prevailed &s;o ea&s;ily
with James to abandon a project, which, during &s;o many
<PB N="80" REF="98">
years, had been the object of all his wi&s;hes, and which he
had now unexpectedly conducted to a happy period<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Hacket's Life of Williams.</NOTE>. A
rupture with Spain, the lo&s;s of two millions, were pro|&s;pects
little agreeable to this pacific and indigent monarch:
But finding his only &s;on bent again&s;t a match, which had al|ways
been oppo&s;ed by his people and his parliament, he
yielded to difficulties, which he had not courage nor &s;trength
of mind &s;ufficient to re&s;i&s;t. The Prince, therefore, and
Buckingham, on their arrival at London, a&s;&s;umed in|tirely
the direction of the negotiation; and it was their bu|&s;ine&s;s
to &s;eek for pretences by which they could give a co|lour
to their intended violation of treaty.</P>
<P>THO' the re&s;titution of the Palatinate had ever been con|&s;idered
by James as a natural or nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equence of the
Spani&s;h alliance, he had always forbid his mini&s;ters to in&s;i&s;t
on it as a preliminary article to the conclu&s;ion of the mar|riage-treaty.
He con&s;idered, that that principality was now
intirely in the hands of the emperor and the Duke of Bavaria;
and that it was no longer in the King of Spain's power, by
a &s;ingle &s;troke of his pen, to re&s;tore it to the antient proprie|tor.
The &s;trict alliance of Spain with the&s;e princes would
engage Philip, he thought, to &s;often &s;o di&s;agreeable a de|mand
by every art of negotiation; and many articles mu&s;t
of nece&s;&s;ity be adju&s;ted, before &s;uch an important point
could be effectuated. It was &s;ufficient, in James's opinion,
if the &s;incerity of the Spani&s;h court could, for the pre&s;ent,
be a&s;certained; and, dreading farther delays of the marriage,
&s;o long wi&s;hed for, he was re&s;olved to tru&s;t the Palatine's
full re&s;toration to the event of future coun&s;els and delibera|tions
<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Parl, Hi&s;t. vol. vi. p. 57.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THIS whole &s;y&s;tem of politics, Buckingham now re|ver&s;ed;
and he overturned every &s;uppo&s;ition upon which the
treaty had hitherto been conducted. After many fruitle&s;s
<PB N="81" REF="99">

received po&s;itive orders not to deliver the proxy, which

&s;ecurity was given for the full re&s;titution of the Palatinate<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Ru&s;hworth, vol. i. p. 105, Kennet, p. 776.</NOTE>. Philip under&s;tood this language. He had been acquainted
with the di&s;gu&s;t received by Buckingham; and deeming
him a man capable of &s;acrificing, to his own ungoverna|ble
pa&s;&s;ions, the greate&s;t intere&s;ts of his ma&s;ter and of his
country, he had expected that the unbounded credit of that
favourite would be employed to embroil the two nations.
Determined, however, to throw the blame of the rupture
intirely on the Engli&s;h, he delivered into Bri&s;tol's hand a
written promi&s;e, by which he bound him&s;elf to procure the
re&s;toration of the Palatine, either by per&s;ua&s;ion, or by every
other po&s;&s;ible means; and, when he found that that conce&s;&s;ion
gave no &s;atisfaction, he ordered the Infanta to lay a&s;ide the
title of Prince&s;s of Wales, which &s;he bore after the arrival
of the di&s;pen&s;ation from Rome, and to drop the &s;tudy of the
Engli&s;h language<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Franklyn, p. 80. Ru&s;hworth, vol. i. p. 112.</NOTE>. And thinking that &s;uch ra&s;h councils
as now governed the court of England would not &s;top at the
breach of the marriage treaty, he ordered preparations for
war immediately to be made throughout all his dominions<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Ru&s;hworth, vol. i. p. 114.</NOTE>.</P>

the rules of politics, conducted, &s;o near an honourable end,
the marriage of his &s;on and the re&s;toration of his &s;on-in|law,
&s;ailed at la&s;t of his purpo&s;e, by means equally unac|countable.</P>
<P>BUT, tho' the expedients already u&s;ed by Buckingham
were &s;uffciently inglorious, both for him&s;elf and for the na|tion;

no effectual &s;tep of any kind could be taken.
The benevolence,<NOTE PLACE="marg">19th of Feb.</NOTE> which, during the interval, had been
rigorou&s;ly exacted for the recovery of the Palatinate, tho'
levied for &s;o popular an end, had procured the King le&s;s

that the Spani&s;h alliance, which gave &s;uch umbrage, being

was calculated intirely to mi&s;lead the parliament, and
to throw on the court of Spain the reproach of artifice
and in&s;incerity. He &s;aid, that, after many years negotia|tion,

<P>THIS narrative, which, con&s;idering the importance of the

was delivered, de&s;erves great blame, was yet vouched for
truth by the Prince of Wales, who was pre&s;ent; and
the King him&s;elf lent it, indirectly, his authority, by telling
the parliament, that it was by his order Buckingham laid
the whole affair before them. The conduct of the&s;e princes
it is difficult fully to excu&s;e. 'Tis in vain to plead the
youth and inexperience of Charles; unle&s;s his inexperience
and youth, 'as is probable<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">The moment the prince em|barked at St. Andero's, he &s;aid, to tho&s;e about him, that it was folly in the Spaniards to u&s;e him &s;o ill, and allow him to depart: A proof that the Duke had made him believe they were in&s;incere in the affair of the marriage and the Palatinate: For, as to his reception, in other re&s;pects, it had been alto|gether unexceptionable: Be&s;ides, had not the Prince believed the Spaniards to be in&s;incere, he had no rea&s;on to quarrel with them, tho' Buckingham had. It appears, therefore, that Charles him&s;elf mu&s;t have been deceived.

BUCKINGHAM's narrative, however artfully di&s;gui&s;ed,
contained yet &s;o many contradictory circum&s;tances as were
&s;ufficient to open the eyes of all rea&s;onable men; but it con|curred
&s;o well with the pa&s;&s;ions and prejudices of the par|liament,
that no &s;cruple was made of immediately adopting it<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Parl. Hi&s;t. vol. vi. p. 75.</NOTE>.
Charmed with having obtained at la&s;t the opportunity,
&s;o long wi&s;hed for, of going to war with papi&s;ts, they little
thought of future con&s;equences; but immediately advi&s;ed
the King to break off both treaties with Spain, as well that
which regarded the marriage, as that for the re&s;titution
of the Palatinate<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Franklyn, p. 98. Ru&s;hworth, vol. i. p. 128. Parl. Hi&s;t. vol. vi. p. 103.</NOTE>. The people, ever greedy of war, till they
&s;uffer by it, di&s;played their triumph at the&s;e violent mea&s;ures
by public bonfires and rejoicings, and by in&s;ults on the
Spani&s;h mini&s;ters. Buckingham was now the favourite of
the publick and of the parliament. Sir Edward Coke, in
the hou&s;e of commons, called him the Saviour of the na|tion<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Clarendon, vol. i. p. 6.</NOTE>.
Every place re&s;ounded with his prai&s;es. And he
him&s;elf, intoxicated by a popularity, which he enjoyed &s;o
little time, and which he &s;o little de&s;erved, violated all duty
to his indulgent ma&s;ter, and entered into cabals with the pu|ritan
members, who had ever oppo&s;ed the royal authority.
He even encouraged &s;chemes for aboli&s;hing the order of
bi&s;hops, and &s;elling the dean and chapter lands, in order to
defray the expences of a Spani&s;h war. And the King, tho'
he &s;till entertained projects for temporizing, and for form|ing
an accommodation with Spain, was &s;o borne down by
the torrent of popular prejudices, conducted and increa&s;ed
by Buckingham, that he was at la&s;t obliged, in a &s;peech to
parliament, to declare in favour of ho&s;tile mea&s;ures, if they
would engage to &s;upport him<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Franklyn, p. 94, 95. Ru&s;hworth, vol. i. p. 129, 130.</NOTE>. Doubts of their &s;incerity

in this re&s;pect; doubts which the event &s;howed not to be
ill grounded; had probably been one cau&s;e of his former
pacific and dilatory mea&s;ures.</P>
<P>IN his &s;peech on this occa&s;ion, the King began with la|menting
his misfortune, that, having &s;o long valued him&s;elf
on the epithet of the pacific monarch, he &s;hould now, in
his old age, be obliged to exchange the ble&s;&s;ings of peace
for the inevitable calamities of war. He repre&s;ented to them
the immen&s;e and continued expence, requi&s;ite for military
armaments; and be&s;ides &s;upplies, from time to time, as
they &s;hould become nece&s;&s;ary, he demanded a vote of &s;ix
&s;ub&s;idies and twelve fifteenths, as a proper &s;tock before the
commencement of ho&s;tilities. He told them of his into|lerable
debts and burthens, chiefly contracted by the &s;ums
remitted to the Palatine<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Among other particulars, he mentions a &s;um of 80,000 pounds bor|rowed from the king of Denmark. In a former &s;peech to the Parliament, he told them, that he had expended 500,000 pounds in the cau&s;e of the Palatine, be&s;ides the voluntary contribution given him by the people. See Franklyn, p. 50. But what is more extraordinary, the trea&s;urer, in order to &s;how his own good &s;ervices, boa&s;ts to the parliament, that, by his contrivance, 60,000 pounds had been &s;aved on the head of exchange in the &s;ums remitted to the Palatinate. This &s;eems very great, nor is it conceivable wh$nce the King could procure &s;uch va&s;t &s;ums as would require a &s;um &s;o great to be paid in exchange. From the whole, however, it appears, that the King had been far from neglecting the intere&s;ts of his daughter and &s;on-in-law, and had even gone much beyond what his narrow revenue could afford.</NOTE>; but he added, that he did not
in&s;i&s;t on any &s;upply for his own relief, and that it was &s;uf|ficient
for him, if the honour and &s;ecurity of the public
were provided for. To remove all &s;u&s;picion, he, who had
ever &s;trenuou&s;ly maintained his prerogative, and even ex|tended
it into &s;ome points e&s;teemed doubtful, now made a
mo&s;t imprudent conce&s;&s;ion, of which the con&s;equences might
have proved fatal to royal authority: He voluntarily offered,
that the money voted &s;hould be paid in to a committee of par|liament,
and &s;hould be i&s;&s;ued by them, without being in|tru&s;ted
to his management<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Ru&s;hworth, vol. i$ p. 137.</NOTE>. The commons willingly ac|cepted
<PB N="86" REF="104">
of this conce&s;&s;ion, &s;o unprecedented in an Engli&s;h
monarch; they voted him only three &s;ub&s;idies and three fif|tenths
<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Le&s;s than 300,000 pounds.</NOTE>; and they took no notice of the complaints which
he made of his own wants and nece&s;&s;ities.</P>
<P>ADVANTAGE was al&s;o taken of the pre&s;ent good agree|ment
between the King and parliament, in order to pa&s;s
the bill again&s;t monopolies, which had formerly been encouraged
by the King, but which had failed by the rupture between
him and the la&s;t hou&s;e of commons. This bill was con|ceived
in &s;uch terms as to render it merely declarative; and
all monopolies were condemned, as contrary to law and to
the known liberties of the people. It was there &s;uppo&s;ed,
that every &s;ubject of England had intire power to di&s;po&s;e
of his own actions, provided he did no injury to any of his fellow
&s;ubjects; and that no prerogative of the King, no power of
any magi&s;trate, nothing but the authority alone of laws,
could re&s;train that unlimited freedom. The full pro&s;ecution
of this noble principle into all its nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equences,
has, at la&s;t, thro' many conte&s;ts, produced that &s;ingular and
happy government, which at pre&s;ent we enjoy<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot"><P>How little this principle had pre|vailed, during any former period of the Engli&s;h government, particularly during the la&s;t reign, which was certainly not &s;o perfect a model of liberty as &s;ome writers would repre&s;ent it, will ea&s;ily appear from many pa&s;&s;ages in the hi&s;tory of that reign. But the ideas of men were much changed, du|ring about twenty years of a gentle and peaceful admini&s;tration. The com|mons, tho' James, of him&s;elf, had recalled all patents of monopolies, were not contented without a law again&s;t them, and a declarative law too; which was gaining a great point, and e&s;tabli&s;hing principles very favourable to liber|ty: But they were extremely grateful, when Elizabeth, upon petition (after having once refu&s;ed their reque&s;ts) recalled a few of the mo&s;t oppre&s;&s;ive pa|tents; and employed &s;ome &s;oothing expre&s;&s;ions towards them.</P>
<P>THE parliament had &s;urely rea&s;on, when they confe&s;&s;ed, in the &s;eventh of James, that he allowed them more freedom of debate, than ever was indulged by any of his predece&s;&s;ors. His indulgence in this particular, joined to his ea&s;y temper, was probably one cau&s;e of the great power a&s;&s;umed by the commons. Mon&s;ieur de la Boderie, in his di&s;patches, Vol. i. p. 449, mentions the liberty of &s;peech in the hou&s;e of commons as a new prac|tice.</P></NOTE>.</P>

THE hou&s;e of commons al&s;o corroborated, by a new
precedent, the important power of impeachment, which,
two years before, they had exerci&s;ed, in the ca&s;e of Chan|cellor
Bacon, and which had lain dormant for more than a
century before, except when they &s;erved as in&s;truments of
royal vengeance. The Earl of Middle&s;ex had been rai&s;ed
by Buckingham's intere&s;t from the rank of a London mer|chant,
to be Lord high trea&s;urer of England; and, by his
activity and addre&s;s, &s;eemed not unworthy of that prefer|ment.
But, having incurred the di&s;plea&s;ure of his patron,
by &s;crupling or refu&s;ing &s;ome demands of money, during
the Prince's re&s;idence in Spain, that favourite vowed revenge,
and employed all his credit among the commons to procure
an impeachment of the trea&s;urer. The King was extremely
di&s;&s;atisfied with this mea&s;ure, and prophe&s;ied to the Prince
and Duke, that they would live to have their fill of parlia|mentary
pro&s;ecutions<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Clarendon, vol. i. p. 23.</NOTE>. In a &s;peech to the parliament, he
endeavoured to apologize for Middle&s;ex, and to &s;often the
accu&s;ation again&s;t him<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Parl. Hi&s;t. vol. vi. p. 191.</NOTE>. The charge, however, was &s;till
maintained by the commons; and the trea&s;urer was found
guilty by the peers, tho' the mi&s;demeanors proved again&s;t
him, were neither numerous nor important. The accept|ing
two pre&s;ents, of five hundred pounds apiece, for the
pa&s;&s;ing two patents, was the article of greate&s;t weight. His
&s;entence was, to be fined 50,000 pounds for the King's
u&s;e, and to &s;uffer all the other penalties formerly inflicted
upon Bacon. The fine was afterwards remitted by the
Prince, when he mounted the throne.</P>

an intire indulgence of the catholics; and &s;eemed to repre|&s;ent

&s;ettled aver&s;ion. Tho' he di&s;&s;embled his re&s;entment, he be|gan
to e&s;trange him&s;elf from Buckingham, to whom he a&s;|cribed
all tho&s;e violent coun&s;els, and whom he con&s;idered as
the author, both of the Prince's journey into Spain, and of
the breach of the marriage treaty. The arrival of Bri&s;tol
he impatiently longed for; and it was by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of that
mini&s;ter, who&s;e wi&s;dom he re&s;pected, and who&s;e views he ap|proved,
that he hoped in time to extricate him&s;elf from his

DURING the Prince's abode in Spain,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Return of Bri&s;tol.</NOTE> that able nego|tiator
had ever oppo&s;ed, tho' un&s;ucce&s;sfully, to the impe|tuous
mea&s;ures &s;ugge&s;ted by Buckingham, his own wi&s;e and
well tempered coun&s;els. After Charles's departure, upon
the fir&s;t appearance of a change of re&s;olution, he &s;till in|terpo&s;ed
his advice, and &s;trenuou&s;ly in&s;i&s;ted on the &s;incerity
of the Spaniards in the conduct of the treaty, as well
as the advantages which England mu&s;t reap from the com|pletion
of it. Enraged to find that his &s;ucce&s;sful and &s;kil|ful
labours &s;hould be rendered abortive by the levities and
caprices of an in&s;olent minion, he would under&s;tand no
hints; and nothing but expre&s;s orders from his ma&s;ter could
engage him to make that demand, which he was &s;en&s;ible
would put a final period to the treaty. He was not there|fore
&s;urpri&s;ed to hear that Buckingham had declared him|&s;elf
his open enemy, and, both before the council and par|liament,
had thrown out many &s;candalous reflections again&s;t
him. Upon the fir&s;t order, he prepared for leaving Madrid;
and he was conducted to the King of Spain and the Cond&eacute;
Duke, in order to fulfil the ceremonial of his departure.</P>
<P>PHILIP, by the mouth of his mini&s;ter, expre&s;&s;ed much
regret, that Bri&s;tol's &s;ervices &s;hould meet with &s;o unworthy
a reward, and that his enemies &s;hould &s;o far have prevailed
as to infu&s;e prejudices into his ma&s;ter and his country again&s;t
a mini&s;ter, who had &s;o faithfully done his duty to both. He
entreated him to fix his abode in Spain, rather than expo&s;e
him&s;elf to the inveterate malice of his rival and the ungovern|able
fury of the people. He offered him every advantage of rank and
fortune, to $often the rigors of bani&s;hment; and, le&s;t his honour &s;hould &s;uffer by the de&s;ertion of his native
country, the monarch promi&s;ed to confer all the&s;e advan|tages,
with a public declaration, that they were be&s;towed
merely for his fidelity to the tru&s;t committed to him. And
he added, that he e&s;teemed &s;uch a conduct of importance to
his own &s;ervice; that all his mini&s;ters, ob&s;erving his regard
<PB N="90" REF="108">
to virtue even in a &s;tranger, might be the more animated to
exert their fidelity towards &s;o generous a ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>THE Earl of Bri&s;tol, while he expre&s;&s;ed the utmo&s;t gra|titude
for this princely offer, thought him&s;elf obliged to de|cline
the acceptance of it. He &s;aid, that nothing would
more confirm all the calumnies of his enemies than his re|maining
at Madrid, and his receiving honour and prefer|ment
from his catholic Maje&s;ty; that the highe&s;t dignity of
the Spani&s;h monarchy, however valued, would be but an
unequal compen&s;ation for the lo&s;s of his honour, which he
mu&s;t &s;acrifice to the obtaining it; that he tru&s;ted to his own
innocence for protection again&s;t all the fury of popular pre|judice;
and that his ma&s;ter was &s;o ju&s;t and gracious, that,
however he might for a time be &s;educed by calumny, he
would &s;urely afford him an opportunity of defending him|&s;elf,
and would in the end re&s;tore him to his favour and good
opinion.</P>
<P>So magnanimous an an&s;wer increa&s;ed the e&s;teem which
Philip had conceived of the amba&s;&s;ador. That prince beg|ged
him, at lea&s;t, to accept of a pre&s;ent of 10,000 ducats,
which might be requi&s;ite for his &s;upport, till he could di&s;&s;i|pate
the prejudices contracted again&s;t him; and he pro|mi&s;ed,
that this compliance &s;hould for ever remain a &s;ecret
to all the world, and &s;hould never come to the knowlege of
his ma&s;ter. <HI>There is one per&s;on,</HI> replied the generous Eng|gli&s;hman,
<HI>who mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily know it: He is the Earl
of Bri&s;tol, who will certainly reveal it to the King of Eng|land</HI><NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Franklyn, p. 86. Ru&s;hworth, vol. i. p. 113.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>NOTHING could be of greater con&s;equence to Bucking|ham,
than to keep Bri&s;tol at a di&s;tance both from the King
and the parliament; le&s;t the power of truth, enforced by
&s;o powerful a &s;peaker, &s;hould open &s;cenes, which were but
&s;u&s;pected by the former, and of which the latter had as yet
entertained no manner of jealou&s;y. He applied therefore
<PB N="91" REF="109">
to James, who&s;e weakne&s;s, di&s;gui&s;ed to him&s;elf under the
appearance of fine&s;&s;e and di&s;&s;imulation, was now become
ab&s;olutely incurable. A warrant for &s;ending Bri&s;tol to the
Tower was i&s;&s;ued immediately upon his arrival in Eng|land<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Ru&s;hworth, vol. i. p. 145.</NOTE>; and though he was &s;oon relea&s;ed from that confine|ment,
yet orders were carried him from the King, to retire
to his country &s;eat, and to ab&s;tain from all attendance on
parliament. He obeyed; but loudly demanded an oppor|portunity
of ju&s;tifying him&s;elf, and of laying his whole
conduct before his ma&s;ter. On all occa&s;ions, he prote&s;ted
his innocence, and threw on his enemy the blame of every
mi&s;carriage. Buckingham, and, at his in&s;tigation, the
Prince, declared, that they would be reconciled to Bri&s;tol,
if he would but acknowlege his errors and ill conduct: But
the &s;pirited nobleman, jealous of his honour, refu&s;ed to buy
favour at &s;o high a price. James had the equity to &s;ay,
that the in&s;i&s;ting on that condition was a &s;train of unex|ampled
tyranny: But Buckingham &s;crupled not to a&s;&s;ert,
with the utmo&s;t pre&s;umption, that neither the King, the
Prince, nor him&s;elf, were as yet &s;atisfied of Bri&s;tol's in|nocence<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Idem ibid. p. 259.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>WHILE the attachment of the Prince to Buckingham,
while the timidity of James, or the &s;hame of changing his
favourite, kept the whole court in awe; the Spani&s;h am|ba&s;&s;ador,
Inoio&s;a, endeavoured to open the King's eyes,
and to cure his fears by in&s;tilling greater fears into him.
He privately &s;lipt into his hand a paper, and gave him a
&s;ignal to read it alone. He there told him, that he was as
much a pri&s;oner at London as ever Francis I. was at Ma|drid;
that the Prince and Buckingham had con&s;pired toge|ther,
and had the whole court at their devotion; that ca|bals
among the popular leaders in parliament were carrying
on to the extreme prejudice of his authority; that the pro|ject
was to confine him to &s;ome of his hunting &s;eats, and to

<P>WHAT credit James gave to this repre&s;entation does
not appear. He only di&s;covered &s;ome faint &s;ymptoms, which
he in&s;tantly retracted, of di&s;&s;atisfaction with Buckingham.
All his public mea&s;ures, and all the alliances into which he
entered,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rupture with Spain.</NOTE> were founded on the &s;y&s;tem of enmity to the Au|&s;trian
family, and of war to be carried on for the recovery
of the Palatinate.</P>
<P>THE &s;tates of the United Provinces, at this time, were
governed by Maurice; and that a&s;piring prince, &s;en&s;ible
that his credit would langui&s;h during peace, had, on the
expiration of the twelve years truce, renewed the war with
the Spani&s;h monarchy. His great capacity in the military
art would have compen&s;ated for the inferiority of his forces,
had not the Spani&s;h armies been commanded by Spinola, a
general equally renowned for conduct, and more celebrated
for enterprize and activity. In &s;uch a &s;ituation, nothing
could be more welcome to the republic than the pro&s;pect
of a rupture between James and the catholic King; and
they flattered them&s;elves, as well from the natural union
of intere&s;ts between them and England, as from the in|fluence
of the pre&s;ent conjuncture, that powerful &s;uc|cours
would &s;oon march to their relief. Accordingly, an
army of &s;ix thou&s;and men was levied in England, and &s;ent
over into Holland, commanded by four young noblemen,
E&s;&s;ex, Oxford, Southampton, and Willoughby, who were
ambitious of di&s;tingui&s;hing them&s;elves in &s;o popular a
cau&s;e, and of acquiring military experience under &s;o re|nowned
a captain as Maurice.</P>
<P><PB N="93" REF="113">
IT might rea&s;onably have been expected,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Treaty with France.</NOTE> that, as reli|gious
zeal had made the recovery of the Palatinate appear
a point of &s;uch va&s;t importance in England; the &s;ame effect
mu&s;t have been produced in France, by the force merely
of political views and con&s;iderations. While that princi|pality
remained in the hands of the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria, the
French dominions were &s;urrounded on all &s;ides by the po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ions
of that ambitious family, and might be invaded by
&s;uperior forces from every quarter. It concerned the King
of France therefore to prevent the peaceable e&s;tabli&s;hment
of the Emperor in his new conque&s;ts; and both by the
&s;ituation and greater power of his &s;tate, he was better en|abled
than James to give &s;uccour to the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Palatine.
But tho' the&s;e views e&s;caped not Louis, nor Cardinal Rich|lieu,
who now began to acquire an a&s;cendant in the French
court; that mini&s;ter was determined to pave the way for
his enterprizes by fir&s;t &s;ubduing the Hugonots, and thence
to proceed, by mature coun&s;els, to humble the hou&s;e of
Au&s;tria. The pro&s;pect, however, of a conjunction with
England was pre&s;ently embraced, and all imaginable encou|ragement
was given to every propo&s;al for conciliating a
marriage between Charles and the Prince&s;s Henrietta.</P>
<P>NOTWITHSTANDING the &s;en&s;ible experience which
James might have acquired of the un&s;urmountable anti|pathy
entertained by his &s;ubjects again&s;t all alliance with ca|tholics,
he &s;till per&s;evered in the opinion that his &s;on would
be degraded by receiving into his bed a prince&s;s of le&s;s than
royal extraction. After the rupture, therefore, with Spain,
nothing remained but an alliance with France; and to that
court he immediately applied him&s;elf<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Ru&s;hworth, vol. i. p. 152.</NOTE>. The &s;ame allure|ments
had not here place, which had &s;o long entangled him

inferior; and the peaceable re&s;toration of the Palatine could
not thence be expected. But James was afraid le&s;t his &s;on

as &s;oon as the chri&s;tian king demanded, for the honour of
his crown, the &s;ame terms which had been granted to the
catholic, he was prevailed with to comply. And as the
Prince, during his abode in Spain, had given a verbal pro|mi&s;e
to allow the Infanta the education of her children till
the age of thirteen, this article was here in&s;erted in the
treaty; and to that imprudence is generally imputed the pre|&s;ent
di&s;tre&s;&s;ed condition of his po&s;terity. The court of
England, however, it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, always pretended,
even in their memorials to the French court, that all the fa|vourable
conditions, granted to the catholics, were in&s;erted
in the marriage treaty merely to plea&s;e the Pope, and that
their &s;trict execution, by an agreement with France, was &s;e|cretly

It can &s;carce, therefore, be que&s;tioned, but this article, which has &s;o odd an appearance, was in&s;erted only to amu&s;e the Pope, and was never intended by either party to be executed.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>As much as the conclu&s;ion of the marriage treaty was
acceptable to the King, as much were all the military enter|prizes
di&s;agreeable, both from the extreme difficulty of the
undertaking in which he was engaged, and from his own
incapacity for &s;uch a &s;cene of action.</P>
<P>DURING the Spani&s;h negotiation, Heidelberg and Man|heim
had been taken by the imperial forces; and Franken|dale,
tho' the garri&s;on was entirely Engli&s;h, was clo&s;ely be|&s;ieged
by them. Upon re-iterated remon&s;trances from
James, Spain interpo&s;ed, and procured a &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of arms
during eighteen months. But as Frankendale was the only
place of Frederic's antient dominions, which continued in his
hands, Ferdinand, being de&s;irous of withdrawing his
<PB N="95" REF="117">
forces from the Palatinate, and of leaving that &s;tate in &s;e|curity,
was unwilling that &s;o important a fortre&s;s &s;hould
remain in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the enemy. To compromi&s;e all
differences, it was agreed to &s;eque&s;trate it in the Infanta's
hands as a neutral per&s;on; upon condition that, upon the
expiration of the truce, it &s;hould be delivered to Frederic;
tho' peace &s;hould not, at that time, be concluded between
him and Ferdinand<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Ru&s;hworth, vol. i. p. 74.</NOTE>. After the unexpected rupture with
Spain, the Infanta, when James demanded the execution
of the treaty, offered him peaceable po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Franken|dale,
and even promi&s;ed a &s;afe conduct for the garri&s;on
thro' the Spani&s;h Netherlands: But there was &s;ome terri|tory
of the empire interpo&s;ed between her &s;tate and the
Palatinate; and for pa&s;&s;age over that territory, no terms
were &s;tipulated<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Idem ibid. p. $51.</NOTE>. By this chicane, which certainly had
not been employed if amity with Spain had been pre&s;erved,
the Palatine was totally di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of all his patrimonial
dominions.</P>
<P>THE Engli&s;h nation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mansfeldt's expedition.</NOTE> however, and James's warlike coun|cil,
were not di&s;couraged. It was &s;till determined to re|conquer
the Palatinate; a &s;tate lying in the mid&s;t of Ger|many,
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed intirely by the Emperor and Bavaria, &s;ur|rounded
by potent enemies, and cut off from all communi|cation
with England. Count Mansfeldt was taken into pay;
and an Engli&s;h army of 12,000 foot and 200 hor&s;e was
levied by a general pre&s;s throughout the kingdom. During
the negotiation with France, va&s;t promi&s;es had been made,
tho' in general terms, by the French mini&s;try; not only
that a free pa&s;&s;age &s;hould be granted to the Engli&s;h troops,
but al&s;o that powerful &s;uccours &s;hould join them in their
march towards the Palatinate. In England, all the&s;e pro|fe&s;&s;ions
were ha&s;tily interpreted to be po&s;itive engagements.
The troops under Mansfeldt's command were embarked at
Dover; but, upon &s;ailing over to Calais,<NOTE PLACE="marg">December.</NOTE> found no orders
<PB N="96" REF="118">
yet arrived for their admi&s;&s;ion.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1625.</NOTE> After waiting in vain for
&s;ome time, they were obliged to &s;ail towards Zealand;
where no proper mea&s;ures were yet concerted for their di&s;|embarkation;
and &s;ome &s;cruples aro&s;e among the &s;tates on
account of the &s;carcity of provi&s;ions. Mean while, a pe&s;|tilential
di&s;temper crept in among the Engli&s;h forces, &s;o
long cooped up in narrow ve&s;&s;els. Half the army died
while on board; and the other half, weakened by &s;ickne&s;s,
appeared too &s;mall a body to march into the Palatinate<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Franklyn, p. 104. Ru&s;hworth, vol. i. p. 154. Dugdale, p. 24.</NOTE>.
And thus ended this ill-concerted and fruitle&s;s expedition;
the only di&s;a&s;ter which happened to England during the
pro&s;perous and pacific reign of James.</P>
<P>THAT reign was now drawing towards a conclu&s;ion.
With peace, &s;o &s;ucce&s;sfully cultivated, and &s;o pa&s;&s;ionately
loved by this monarch, his life al&s;o terminated. This
&s;pring, he was &s;eized with a tertian ague; and, when en|couraged
by his courtiers with the common proverb, that
this di&s;temper, during that &s;ea&s;on, was health for a king,
he replied, that the proverb was meant of a young king.
After &s;ome fits, he found him&s;elf extremely weakened, and
&s;ent for the Prince, whom he exhorted to bear a tender
affection for his wife, but to pre&s;erve a con&s;tancy in reli|gion;
to protect the church of England; and to extend
his care towards the unhappy family of the Palatine<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Ru&s;hworth, vol. i. p. 155.</NOTE>.
With decency and courage, he prepared him&s;elf for his
end;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Death of the King.</NOTE> and he expired on the 27th of March, after a reign
over England of twenty-two years and a few days; and in
the fifty-ninth year of his age. His reign over Scotland was
almo&s;t of equal duration with his life.</P>
<P>No prince,<NOTE PLACE="marg">His cha|racter.</NOTE> &s;o little enterpri&s;ing and &s;o inoffen&s;ive, was
ever &s;o much expo&s;ed to the oppo&s;ite extremes of calumny
and flattery, of &s;atire and panegyric. And the factions,
which began in his time, being &s;till continued, have made
<PB N="97" REF="119">
his character be as much di&s;puted to this day, as is com|monly
that of princes who are our contemporaries. Many
virtues, however, it mu&s;t be owned, he was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of;
but no one of them pure, or free from the contagion of the
neighbouring vices. His genero&s;ity bordered on profu&s;ion,
his learning on pedantry, his pacific di&s;po&s;ition on pu&s;illani|mity,
his wi&s;dom on cunning, his friend&s;hip on light fancy
and boyi&s;h fondne&s;s. While he imagined that he was only
maintaining his own authority, he may perhaps be &s;u&s;pected,
in &s;ome of his actions, and &s;till more of his preten&s;ions,
to have encroached on the liberties of his people: While
he endeavoured, by an exact neutrality, to acquire the
good will of all his neighbours, he was able to pre&s;erve
fully the e&s;teem and regard of none. His capacity was con|&s;iderable;
but fitter to di&s;cour&s;e on general maxims than
to conduct any intricate bu&s;ine&s;s: His intentions were ju&s;t;
but more adapted to the conduct of private life, than to the
government of kingdoms. Aukward in his per&s;on, and
ungainly in his manners, he was ill qualified to command
re&s;pect; partial and undi&s;cerning in his affections, he was
little fitted to acquire general love. Of a feeble temper
more than of a frail judgment: Expo&s;ed to our ridicule
from his vanity; but exempt from our hatred by his free|dom
from pride and arrogance. And upon the whole, it
may be pronounced of his character, that all his qualities
were fullied with weakne&s;s, and embelli&s;hed by humanity.
Political courage he certainly was devoid of; and from
thence chiefly is derived the &s;trong prejudice which pre|vails
again&s;t his per&s;onal bravery: An inference, however,
which mu&s;t be owned, from general experience, to be ex|tremely
fallacious.</P>
<P>HE was only once married, to Anne of Denmark, who

virtues. She loved expen&s;ive amu&s;ements and &s;hows; but
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed no ta&s;te in her plea&s;ures. A great comet appeared

the forerunner of that event. So con&s;iderable in their eyes
are even the mo&s;t in&s;ignificant princes.</P>
<P>HE left only one &s;on, Charles, then in the twenty-fifth
year of his age; and one daughter, Elizabeth, married to
the Elector Palatine. She was aged twenty-nine years.
Tho&s;e alone remained of &s;ix legitimate children born to him.
He never had any illegitimate; and he never di&s;covered any
tendency, even the &s;malle&s;t, towards a pa&s;&s;ion for any mi&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>THE archbi&s;hops of Canterbury during this reign were,
Whytgift, who died in 1604; Bancroft, in 1610; Abbot,
who &s;urvived the King. The chancellors, Lord Elle&s;more,
who re&s;igned in 1617; Bacon was fir&s;t Lord keeper till
1619, then was created chancellor, and was di&s;placed in
1621; Williams, bi&s;hop of Lincoln, was created lord
keeper in his place. The high trea&s;urers were the Earl of
Dor&s;et, who died in 1609; the Earl of Sali&s;bury, in 1612;
the Earl of Suffolk fined and di&s;placed for bribery in 1618;
Lord Mandeville, re&s;igned in 1621; Earl of Middle&s;ex, di&s;|placed
in 1624; the Earl of Marlborough &s;ucceeded. The
lord admirals were, the Earl of Nottingham, who re&s;igned
in 1618; the Earl, afterwards Duke of Buckingham. The
&s;ecretaries of &s;tate were the Earl of Sali&s;bury, Sir Ralph
Winwood, Nanton, Calvert, Lord Conway, Sir Albertus
Moreton.</P>
<P>THE numbers of the hou&s;e of lords, in the fir&s;t parlia|ment
of this reign, be&s;ide the bi&s;hops, were &s;eventy-eight
temporal peers. The numbers in the fir&s;t parliament of
Charles were ninety-&s;even. Con&s;equently James, during
that period, created nineteen new peerages above tho&s;e that
expired.</P>
<P>THE hou&s;e of commons, in the fir&s;t parliament of this
reign, con&s;i&s;ted of four hundred and &s;ixty-&s;even members.
It appears, that four boroughs revived their charters, which
they had formerly neglected. And as the fir&s;t parliament of
Charles con&s;i&s;ted of four hundred and ninety four members,
we may infer that James erected ten new boroughs.</P>

<P>IT may not be improper, at this period, to make a
pau&s;e; and take a &s;urvey of the &s;tate of the kingdom,
with regard to government, manners, finances, arms, trade,
learning. Where a ju&s;t notion is not formed of the&s;e parti|culars,
hi&s;tory can be very little in&s;tructive, and often will
not be intelligible.</P>
<P>WE may &s;afely pronounce,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Civil go|vernment of England,</NOTE> that the Engli&s;h government,
at the acce&s;&s;ion of the Scotti&s;h line, was much more arbi|trary,
than it is at pre&s;ent, the prerogative le&s;s limited,
the liberties of the &s;ubject le&s;s accurately defined and &s;ecured.
Without mentioning other particulars, the courts alone of
high commi&s;&s;ion and &s;tar-chamber
were &s;ufficient to lay
the whole kingdom at the mercy of the prince.</P>
<P><PB N="100" REF="124">
THE court of high commi&s;&s;ion had been erected by Eliza|beth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Appendix.</NOTE>
in, con&s;equence of an act of parliament, pa&s;&s;ed at the
beginning, of her reign: By this act, it was thought proper,
during the great revolution of religion, to arm the &s;overeign
with full powers, in order to di&s;courage and &s;uppre&s;s oppo|sition.
All appeals from the inferior eccle&s;ia&s;tical courts
were carried before the high commi&s;&s;ion; and, of con&s;e|quence,
the whole life and doctrine of the clergy lay di|rectly
under its in&s;pection. Every breach of the act of uni|formity,
every refu&s;al of the ceremonies, was cognizable in
this court; and during the reign of Elizabeth, had been
puni&s;hed by deprivation, by fines, confi&s;cations, and impri|&s;onment.
James contented him&s;elf with the gentler penalty
of deprivation; nor was that puni&s;hment inflicted with ri|gour
on every offender<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Archbi&s;hop Spot&s;wood tells us, that he was informed by Bancroft, &s;everal years after the King's acce&s;&s;ion, that not above 45 clergymen had been deprived.</NOTE>. All the catholics too were liable
to be puni&s;hed by this court, if they exerci&s;ed any act of
their religion, or were any way active in &s;ending abroad
their children or other relations, to receive that education,
which they could not procure them in their own country.
Popi&s;h prie&s;ts were thrown into pri&s;on, and might be deli|vered
over to the law, which puni&s;hed them with death;
though that &s;everity had been &s;paringly exerci&s;ed by Eliza|beth,
and never almo&s;t by James. In &s;hort, that liberty of
con&s;cience, which we &s;o highly and &s;o ju&s;tly value at pre&s;ent,
was totally &s;uppre&s;&s;ed; and no exercise of any religion, but
the e&s;tabli&s;hed, was permitted throughout the kingdom.
Any word or writing, which tended towards here&s;y or &s;chi&s;m or
&s;edition, was puni&s;hable by the high commi&s;&s;ioners
or any three of them: They alone were judges what ex|pre&s;&s;ions
had that tendency: They proceeded not by infor|mation,
but upon rumour, &s;u&s;picion, or according to their
own fancy: They admini&s;tered an oath, by which the party
<PB N="101" REF="125">
cited before them, was bound to an&s;wer any que&s;tion,
which &s;hould be propounded to him: Whoever refu&s;ed this
oath, though on pretence that he might thereby be brought
to accu&s;e him&s;elf or his deare&s;t: friend, was puni&s;hable by
impri&s;onment: And in &s;hort, an inqui&s;itorial tribunal, with
all its terrors and iniquities, was erected in the kingdom.
Full di&s;cretionary powers were be&s;towed with regard to the
inquiry, trial, &s;entence, and penalty inflicted; excepting
only that corporal puni&s;hments were re&s;trained by that pa|tent
of the prince, which erected that court, not by the
act of parliament, which empowered him. By rea&s;on of
the uncertain limits, which &s;eparate eccle&s;ia&s;tical from civil
cau&s;es, all accu&s;ations of adultery and ince&s;t were tried by
the court of high commi&s;&s;ion; and every complaint of
wives again&s;t their hu&s;bands was there examined and di&s;|cu&s;&s;ed<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Rymer, tom. xvii. p. 200.</NOTE>.
On like pretences, every cau&s;e, which regarded
cou&s;cience, that is, every cau&s;e, could have been brought
under their juri&s;diction.</P>
<P>BUT there was a &s;ufficient rea&s;on, why the king would
not be &s;olicitous to &s;tretch the juri&s;diction of this court:
The &s;tar-chamber po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the &s;ame authority in civil mat|ters;
and its methods of proceeding were equally arbitrary
and unlimited. The origin of this court was derived from
the mo&s;t remote antiquity<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Ru&s;hworth, vol. ii. p. 473. In Chambers's ca&s;e it was the unanimous opinion of all the court of King's Bench, that the court of &s;tar-chamber was not derived from the &s;tatute of Henry VII. bat was a court many years before, and one of the most high and ho|nourable courts of ju&s;tice. See Croke's rep. term. Mich. 5 Car. I. See further Camden's Brit. vol. i. introd. p. 254. Edit, of Gib&s;on.</NOTE>; though, it is pretended, that its
power had been fir&s;t carried to the utmo&s;t height by Henry
VII. In all times, however, it is confe&s;&s;ed, it enjoyed au|thority;
and at no time was its authority circum&s;cribed, or
method of proceeding directed, by any preci&s;e law or
&s;tatute.</P>
<P><PB N="102" REF="126">
WE have had already, or &s;hall have &s;ufficient occa&s;ion,
during the cour&s;e of this hi&s;tory, to mention the di&s;pen&s;ing
power, the power of impri&s;onment, of exacting forced loans<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">During the two la&s;t centuries, no reign had pa&s;&s;ed without &s;ome forced loans from the &s;ubject.</NOTE>
and benevolence, of pre&s;&s;ing and quartering &s;oldiers, of altering
the cu&s;toms, of erecting monopolies. The&s;e branches of
power, if not directly oppo&s;ite to the principles of all free
government, mu&s;t, at lea&s;t, be acknowleged dangerous to
freedom in a monarchical con&s;titution; where an eternal
jealou&s;y mu&s;t be pre&s;erved again&s;t the &s;overeign, and no di&s;|cretionary
powers mu&s;t ever be entru&s;ted to him, by which
the property or per&s;onal liberty of any &s;ubject can be af|fected.
The kings of England, however, had almo&s;t con|&s;tantly
exerci&s;ed these powers; and if, on any occa&s;ion, the
prince had been obliged to &s;ubmit to laws enacted again&s;t
them, he had ever, in practice, eluded the&s;e laws, and re|turned
to the &s;ame arbitrary admini&s;tration. During more
than a century before the acce&s;&s;ion of James, the regal au|thority,
in almo&s;t all the&s;e particulars, had never once been
called in que&s;tion.</P>
<P>WE may al&s;o ob&s;erve, that the principles in general,
which prevailed during that age, were &s;o favourable to
monarchy, that they be&s;towed on it an authority almo&s;t ab|solute
and unlimited, &s;acred and indefea&s;ible.</P>
<P>THE meetings of parliament were &s;o precarious; their
&s;e&s;&s;ions &s;o &s;hort, compared to the vacations; that, when
men's eyes were turned upwards in &s;earch of &s;overeign
power, the prince alone was apt to &s;trike them as the only
permanent magi&s;trate, inve&s;ted with the whole maje&s;ty and
authority of the &s;tate. The great complai&s;ance too of par|liaments,
during &s;o long a period, had extremely degraded
and ob&s;cured those a&s;&s;emblies; and as all in&s;tances of oppo|sition
to prerogative must have been drawn from a remote
age, they were unknown to a great many, and had the le&s;s
<PB N="103" REF="127">
authority even with tho&s;e, who were acquainted with them.
The&s;e examples, be&s;ides, of liberty, had commonly been
accompanied with such circum&s;tances of violence, convul|&s;ion,
civil war, and di&s;order, that they pre&s;ented but a di&s;|agreeable
idea to the inqui&s;itive part of the people, and af|forded
&s;mall inducement to renew &s;uch di&s;mal &s;cenes. By a
great many, therefore, monarchy, &s;imple and unmixed,
was conceived to be the government of England; and tho&s;e
popular a&s;&s;emblies were &s;uppo&s;ed to form only the ornament
of the fabric, without being, in any degree, e&s;&s;ential to its
being and exi&s;tence<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><P>&startq;Monarchies,&endq; according to Sir Walter Raleigh, &startq;are of two forts touching their power or authority, <HI>viz.</HI> I. Entire, where the whole power of ordering all state matters, both in peace and war, doth, by law and cu&s;tom, appertain to the prince, as in the Engli&s;h kingdom; where the prince hath the power to make laws, league and war; to create ma|giftrates; to pardon life; of appeal, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Though, to give a content|ment to the other degrees, they have a &s;uffrage in making laws, yet ever &s;ubject to the prince's plea&s;ure and negative will.&mdash;2. Limited or re&s;train|ed that hath no full power in all the points and matters of &s;tate, as the military king, that hath not the &s;overeignty in time of peace, as the making of laws, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> But in war only, as the Polonian king. <HI>Maxims of State.</HI>&endq;</P>
<P>And a little after, &startq;In every ju&s;t &s;tate, &s;ome part of the government is, &startq; or ought to be, imparted to the people, as in a kingdom, a voice and &s;uffrage in making laws; and &s;ometimes al&s;o of levying of arms (if the charge be great, and the prince forced to borraw help of his &s;ubjects) the matter rightly may be propounded to a parliament, that the tax may <HI>seem</HI> to have proceeded from them&s;elves. So con&s;ultations and &s;ome proceed|ings in judicial matters may, in part, be referred to them. The rea&s;on, left, &s;eeing them&s;elves to be in no number nor of reckoning, they mi&s;like the &s;tate or government.&endq; This way of rea&s;oning differs little from that of the King, who con&s;idered the privileges of the parliament as matters of grace and indulgence, more than of inheritance. It is remarka|ble, that Raleigh was thought to lean towards the puritanical party, not|with&s;tanding the&s;e po&s;itions. But ideas of government change much in dif|ferent times.</P>
<P>Raleigh's &s;entiments on this head are &s;till more openly expre&s;&s;ed, in his <HI>Prerogative of parliaments,</HI> a work not publi&s;hed till after his death. It is a dialogue between a courtier or coun&s;ellor and a country ju&s;tice of peace, who repre&s;ents the patriot party, and defends the highe&s;t notions of liberty, which the principles of that age would bear. Here is a pa&s;&s;age of it: <HI>Counsellor.</HI> That which is done by the King, with the advice of his private or privy council, is done by the King's absolute power. <HI>Ju&s;tice.</HI> And by who&s;e power is it done in parliament but by the King's absolute power! Mi&s;take it not, my Lord: The three e&s;tates do but advi&s;e as the privy council doth; which advice, if the King embrace, it becomes the King's own act in the one, and the King's law in the other, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>&endq;</P>
<P>The Earl of Clare, in a private letter to his &s;on-in-law Sir Thomas Wentworth, afterwards Earl of Strafford, thus expre&s;&s;es himself, &startq;We live under a prerogative government, where book law &s;ubmits to lex loquens.&endq; He &s;poke from his own, and all his ance&s;lors, experience. There was no &s;ingle in&s;tance of power, which a King of England might not, at that time, exert, on pretence of nece&s;&s;ity or expediency: The continuance alone or frequent repetition of arbitrary admini&s;tration might prove dangerous, for want of force to &s;upport it. It is remarkable that this letter of the Earl of Clare was wrote in the first year of Charles's reign; and con&s;equently must be meant of the general genius of the government, not the spirit or temper of the mon|arch. See Strafford's letters, vol i. p. 32. From another letter in the &s;ame collection, vol. i. p. 10. it appears that the council &s;ometimes a&s;&s;umed the power of forbidding per&s;ons, di&s;agreeable to the court, to &s;tand in the elec|tions. This authority they could exert in &s;ome instances; but we are not thence to infer, that they could &s;hut the door of that hou&s;e to every one who was not acceptable to them. The genius of the antient government repo&s;ed more tru&s;t in the King, than to entertain any &s;uch &s;u&s;picion, and it allowed &s;cattered in&s;tances, of &s;uch a kind as would have been totally de&s;tructive of the con&s;titution, had they been continued without interruption.</P>
<P>I have not met with any Engli&s;h writer of that age, who &s;peaks of England as a limited monarchy, but as an ab&s;olute one, where the people have many privileges. That is no contradiction. In all European monarchies, the people have privileges; but, whether dependant or independant on the will of the monarch, is a que&s;tion, that, in mo&s;t governments, it is be&s;t to forbear. Surely that que&s;tion was not determined, before the age of James. The, ri&s;ing &s;pirit of the parliament, together with that King's love of general, &s;peculative principles, brought it from its ob&s;curity, and made it he com|monly canva&s;&s;ed. The &s;trongest te&s;timony, which I remember from a writer of James's age, in favour of Engli&s;h liberty, is in Cardinal Bentivoglio, a foreigner, who mentions the Engli&s;h government as &s;imilar to that of the Low-country provinces under their princes, rather than to that of France or Spain. Engli&s;hmen were not &s;o &s;en&s;ible that their prince was limited, becau&s;e they were &s;en&s;ible, that no individual had any full &s;ecurity again&s;t a &s;tretch of pre|rogative: But foreigners, by compari&s;on, could perceive, that the&s;e &s;tretches were, at that time, from cu&s;tom or other cau&s;es, le&s;s frequent in England than in other monarchies. Philip de Comines too remarked the Engli&s;h con|stitution to be more popular, in his time, than that of France. But in a paper, wrote by a patriot in 1627, it is remarked that the freedom of &s;peech in parliament had been lo&s;t in England, &s;ince the days of Comines, See Franklyn, p. 238.</P></NOTE>;. The prerogative of the crown was
<PB N="104" REF="128">
repre&s;ented by lawyers as &s;omething real and durable; like
tho&s;e eternal e&s;&s;ences of the schools, which no time nor
<PB N="105" REF="129">
force could alter. The &s;anction of religion, was, by divines,
called in aid; and the Monarch of heaven was &s;uppo&s;ed to
be intere&s;ted in &s;upporting the authority of his earthly vice|gerent.
And though the&s;e doctrines were perhaps more
openly inculcated and more &s;trenuou&s;ly in&s;i&s;ted on during
the reign of the Stuarts, they were not then invented; and
were only found by the court to be more nece&s;&s;ary at that
period, by rea&s;on of the oppo&s;ite doctrines, which <HI>began</HI>
to be promulgated by the puritanical party<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Pa&s;&s;ive obedience is expre&s;sly and zealou&s;ly inculcated in the homilies, compo&s;ed and publi&s;hed by authority, in the reign of Queen Elizabeth. The convocation, which met in the very fir&s;t year of the King's reign, voted as high monarchical principles as are contained in the decrees of the univer&s;ity of Oxford, voted during the rule of the tories. The&s;e principles, &s;o far from being deemed a novelty, introduced by King James's influence, pa&s;&s;ed &s;o &s;moothly, that no hi&s;torian has taken notice of them: They were never the &s;ubject of controver&s;y, or di&s;pute, or di&s;course; and it is only by means of bi&s;hop Overall's Convocation-book, printed near &s;eventy years after, that we are acquainted with them. Would James, who was &s;o cautious, and even timid, have ventured to begin his reign with a bold &s;troke, which would have given ju&s;t ground of jealou&s;y to his &s;ubjects? It appears, from that monarch's Ba&s;ilicon Doron, written while he was in Scotland, that the republican ideas of the origin of power from the people were, at that time, e&s;teemed puritanical novelties. The patriarchal &s;cheme, it is remarkable, is inculcated in tho&s;e votes of the convocation pre&s;erved by Overall; nor was Filmer the fir&s;t inventer of tho&s;e ab&s;urd notions.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IN con&s;equence of the&s;e exalted ideas of kingly authority, the prerogative, be&s;ide the in&s;tances of jur&s;diction, founded on precedent, was, by many, &s;uppo&s;ed to po&s;&s;e&s;s an inex|hau&s;tible fund of latent powers, which might be exerted on any emergence. In every government, nece&s;&s;ity, when real, &s;uper&s;edes all laws, and levels all limitations: But, in the Engli&s;h government, convenience alone was conceived to au|thorize any extraordinary act of regal power, and to render it obligatory on the people. Hence the &s;trict obedience re|quired to proclamations, during all periods of the Engli&s;h hi&s;to|ry

and, if James has incurred blame on account of his
edicts, it is only becau&s;e he i&s;&s;ued them at a time, when they
began to be le&s;s regarded, not becau&s;e he fir&s;t a&s;&s;umed or
extended to an unu&s;ual degree that exerci&s;e of authority.
Of his maxims in a parallel ca&s;e, the following is a pretty
remarkable in&s;tance.</P>
<P>QUEEN Elizabeth had appointed commi&s;&s;ioners for the
in&s;pection of pri&s;ons, and had be&s;towed on them full di&s;|cretionary
powers to adju&s;t all differences between pri&s;oners
and their creditors, to compound debts, and to give liberty to
&s;uch debtors as they found hone&s;t, and incapable of making
full payment. From the uncertain and undefined nature of
the Engli&s;h con&s;titution, doubts &s;prang up in many, that
this commi&s;&s;ion was contrary to law; and it was repre&s;ented
in that light to James. He forbore therefore to renew the
commi&s;&s;ion, till the fifteenth of his reign; when complaints
ro&s;e &s;o high, with regard to the abu&s;es practi&s;ed in pri&s;ons,
that he thought him&s;elf obliged to overcome his &s;cruples,
and to appoint new commi&s;&s;ioners, inve&s;ted with the &s;ame
di&s;cretionary powers, which Elizabeth had formerly con|ferred<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Rymer, tom. xviii. p. 117, 594.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>UPON the whole, we mu&s;t conceive that monarchy, on
the acce&s;&s;ion of the hou&s;e of Stuart, was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a
very exten&s;ive authority: An authority, in the judgment of
all, not exactly limited; in the judgment of &s;ome, not limit|able.
But, at the &s;ame time, this authority was founded
merely on the opinion of the people, influenced by antient
precedent and example. It was not &s;upported either by
money or by force of arms. And, for this rea&s;on, we need
not wonder, that the princes of that line were &s;o extremely
jealous of their prerogative; being &s;en&s;ible, that, when
tho&s;e claims were ravi&s;hed from them, they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed no in|fluence,
by which they could maintain their dignity. By
the changes, which have &s;ince been introduced, the liberty
<PB N="107" REF="133">
and independence of individuals has been rendered much
more full, intire, and &s;ecure; that of the public more un|certain
and precarious.</P>
<P>WE have had occa&s;ion to remark,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Eccle&s;ia&s;ti|cal govern|ment.</NOTE> in &s;o many in&s;tances,
the bigotry which prevailed in that age, that we can look
for no toleration among the different &s;ects. Two Arians,
under the title of heretics, were puni&s;hed with fire during
this period; and no one reign, &s;ince the reformation, had
been free from like barbarities. Stowe &s;ays, that the&s;e
Arians were offered their pardon at the &s;take, if they would
merit it by a recantation. A madman, who called him&s;elf
the Holy Gho&s;t, was, without any indulgence for his frenzy,
condemned to the &s;ame puni&s;hment. Twenty pounds a month,
by law, could be levied from every one, who frequented
not the e&s;tabli&s;hed wor&s;hip. This rigorous law, however,
had one indulgent clau&s;e, that the fines exacted &s;hould not
exceed two thirds of the yearly income of the per&s;on. It
had been u&s;ual for Elizabeth to allow tho&s;e penalties to run
on for &s;everal years; and to levy them all at once, to the
utter ruin of &s;uch catholics, as had incurred her di&s;plea&s;ure.
James was more humane in this, as in every other re&s;pect.
The puritans formed a &s;ect, which &s;ecretly lurked in the
church, but pretended not to any &s;eparate wor&s;hip or di&s;ci|pline.
An attempt of that kind would have been univer&s;ally
regarded as the mo&s;t unpardonable enormity. And had the
King been di&s;po&s;ed to grant the puritans a full toleration for
a &s;eparate exerci&s;e of their religion, it is certain, from the
&s;pirit of the times, that that &s;ect it&s;elf would have de&s;pi&s;ed
and hated him for it, and would have reproached him with
luke-warmne&s;s and indifference in the cau&s;e of religion. They
maintained, that they them&s;elves were the only pure church;
that their principles and practices ought to be e&s;tabli&s;hed by
law; and that no others ought to be tolerated. It may be
que&s;tioned, therefore, whether the admini&s;tration at this
time could with propriety de&s;erve the appellation of per&s;e|cutors
<PB N="108" REF="134">
with regard to the puritans. Such of the clergy as
refu&s;ed to comply with the legal ceremonies were indeed
deprived of their livings, and &s;ometimes were otherwi&s;e
puni&s;hed: And ought any man to accept of an office or
benefice in an e&s;tabli&s;hment, while he declines compliance
with the fixed and known rules of that e&s;tabli&s;hment? But
puritans were never puni&s;hed for frequenting &s;eparate con|gregations;
becau&s;e there were none &s;uch in the kingdom;
and no prote&s;tant ever a&s;&s;umed or pretended to the right of
erecting them. Even the greate&s;t well-wishers of the puri|tanical
&s;ect would have condemned a practice, which in
that age was univer&s;ally regarded as &s;ubver&s;ive of civil &s;o|ciety<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Even &s;o great a philo&s;opher as Lord Bacon, thought that uniformity in religion was nece&s;&s;ary to the &s;upport of government, and that no toleration ought to be given to &s;ectaries. See his e&s;&s;ay <HI>de unitate eccle&s;ioe.</HI></NOTE>.
And nothing but the imputation of idolatry, which
was thrown on the catholic religion, could ju&s;tify in their
eyes the &s;eparation made by the Hugonots and other pro|te&s;tants,
who lived in popi&s;h countries.</P>
<P>THE liberty of the pre&s;s was incompatible with &s;uch
maxims and &s;uch principles of government, and was there|fore
quite unknown in that age. Be&s;ides employing the
two terrible courts of &s;tar-chamber and high commi&s;&s;ion,
who&s;e power was unlimited; Queen Elizabeth exerted her
authority by re&s;traints upon the pre&s;s. She pa&s;&s;ed a decree
in her court of &s;tar-chamber, that is, by her own will and
plea&s;ure, forbidding any book to be printed in any place
but in London, Oxford, and Cambridge<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">28th of Elizabeth. See &s;tate-trials: Sir Robert Knightly, vol. vii, edit. 1.</NOTE>: And another, in
which &s;he prohibited, under &s;evere penalties, the publi&s;hing

<P>THE manners of the nation were agreeable to the mo|narchical
government,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Manners.</NOTE> which prevailed; and contained not
that &s;trange mixture, which, at pre&s;ent, di&s;tingui&s;hes Eng|land
from all other countries. Such violent extremes were
then unknown, of indu&s;try and debauchery, frugality and
profu&s;ion, civility and ru&s;ticity, fanataci&s;m and &s;ceptici&s;m.
Candour, &s;incerity, mode&s;ty are the only qualities, which
the Engli&s;h of that age po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in common with the
pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>HIGH pride of family then prevailed; and it was by a
dignity and &s;tateline&s;s of behaviour, that the gentry and
nobility di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves from the common people.
Great riches, acquired by commerce, were more rare, and
had not, as yet, been able to confound all ranks of men,
and render money the chief foundation of di&s;tinction.
Much ceremony took place in the common intercour&s;e of
life, and little familiarity was indulged by the great. The
advantages, which re&s;ult from opulence, are &s;o &s;olid and
real, that tho&s;e po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of them need not dread the near
approaches of their inferiors. The di&s;tinctions of birth
and title, being more empty and imaginary, &s;oon vani&s;h,
upon familiar acce&s;s and acquaintance.</P>
<P>THE expences of the great con&s;i&s;ted in pomp and &s;how,
and a numerous retinue, rather than in convenience and
true plea&s;ure. The Earl of Nottingham, in his emba&s;&s;y to
Spain, was attended with 500 per&s;ons: The Earl of Hert|ford,
<PB N="110" REF="136">
in that to Bru&s;&s;els, carried 300 gentlemen along with
him. Lord Bacon has remarked, that the Engli&s;h nobility,
in his time, maintained a larger retinue of &s;ervants than the
nobility of any other nation, except, perhaps, the Po|landers<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">E&s;&s;ays Depro&s;er. &s;in, imp.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>CIVIL honours, which now hold the fir&s;t place, were,
at that time, &s;ubordinate to the military. The young
gentry and nobility were fond of di&s;tingui&s;hing them&s;elves
by arms. The fury of duels too prevailed more than at any
time before or &s;ince<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Franklyn, p. 5.</NOTE>. This was the turn, that the ro|mantic
chivalry, for which the nation was formerly &s;o re|nowned,
had lately taken.</P>
<P>LIBERTY of commerce between the &s;exes was indulged;
but without any licentiou&s;ne&s;s of manners. The court was
very little an exception to this ob&s;ervation. James had ra|ther
entertained an aver&s;ion and contempt for the females;
nor were tho&s;e young courtiers, of whom he was &s;o fond,
able to break through the e&s;tabli&s;hed manners of the na|tion.</P>
<P>THE country life prevails at pre&s;ent in England beyond
any cultivated nation of Europe: but it was then much
more generally embraced by all the gentry. The increa&s;e of
arts, plea&s;ures, and &s;ocial commerce, was ju&s;t beginning to
produce an inclination for the &s;ofter and more civilized life
of the city. James di&s;couraged, as much as po&s;&s;ible, this
alteration of manners. &startq; He was wont to be very earne&s;t,&endq;
as Lord Bacon tells us, &startq; with the country gentlemen to go
&startq; from London to their country feats&endq;. And &s;ometimes he
would &s;ay thus to them: &startq; <HI>Gentlemen, at London, yon are
&startq; like &s;bips in a &s;ea, which &s;how like nothing; but, in your
&startq; country villages, you are like &s;hips in a river, which lesk
&startq; like great things</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Apophthegms.</NOTE>&endq;.</P>
<P>HE was not contented with reproof and exhortation. As
Queen Elizabeth had perceived, with regret, the increa&s;e of
<PB N="111" REF="137">
London, and had re&s;trained all new buildings by proclama|tion;
James, who found that the&s;e edicts were not exactly
obeyed, frequently renewed them; though a &s;trict execution
&s;eems &s;till to have been wanting. Re-iterated proclamations
he al&s;o i&s;&s;ued, in imitation of his predece&s;&s;or; containing
&s;evere menaces again&s;t the gentry, who lived in town<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Rymer, tom. xvii. p. 632.</NOTE>.
This policy is contrary to that, which has ever been prac|ti&s;ed
by all princes, who &s;tudied the increa&s;e of their au|thority.
To allure the nobility to court; to engage them
in expen&s;ive plea&s;ures or employments, which di&s;&s;ipate their
fortune; to increa&s;e their &s;ubjection to mini&s;ters by attend|ance;
to weaken their authority in the provinces by ab|&s;ence;
The&s;e have been the common arts of arbitrary go|vernment.
But James had no money to &s;upport a &s;plendid
court, or be&s;tow on a numerous retinue of gentry and nobi|lity.
He thought too, that, by their living together, they
became more &s;en&s;ible of their own &s;trength, and were apt
to indulge too curious re&s;earches into matters of government.
To remedy the pre&s;ent evil, he was de&s;irous of di&s;per&s;ing
them into their country &s;eats; where, he hoped, they would
bear a more &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive reverence to his authority, and re|ceive
le&s;s &s;upport from each other. But the contrary effect
&s;oon followed. The riches, ama&s;&s;ed, during their re&s;idence
at home, rendered them independant. The influence ac|quired
by ho&s;pitality, made them formidable. They would
not be led by the court: They could not be driven: And
thus the &s;y&s;tem of the Engli&s;h government received a total
and a &s;udden alteration in the cour&s;e of le&s;s than forty
years.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t ri&s;e of commerce and the arts had contributed,
in preceding reigns, to &s;catter tho&s;e immen&s;e fortunes of the
barons, which rendered them &s;o formidable both to King
and people. The farther progre&s;s of the&s;e advantages be|gan,
during this reign, to ruin the &s;mall proprietors of
<PB N="112" REF="138">
land<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Cabbala, p. 224. fir&s;t edit.</NOTE>; and, by both events, the gentry, or that rank
which compo&s;ed the hou&s;e of commons, enlarged their
power and authority. The early improvements in luxury
were &s;eized by the greater nobles, who&s;e fortunes, placing
them above frugality, or even calculation, were &s;oon di&s;|&s;ipated
in expen&s;ive plea&s;ures. The&s;e improvements reached
at la&s;t all men of property; and tho&s;e of &s;lender fortunes,
who, at that time, were often men of family, imitating
tho&s;e of a rank immediately above them, reduced them|&s;elves
to poverty. Their lands, coming to &s;ale, &s;welled the
e&s;tates of tho&s;e, who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed riches &s;ufficient for the fa&s;hion|able
expences; but who were not exempted from &s;ome care
and attention to their dome&s;tic oeconomy.</P>
<P>THE gentry al&s;o of that age were engaged in no expence,
except that of country ho&s;pitality. No taxes were levied,
no wars waged, no attendance at court expected, no bribery

and &s;eventy-five thou&s;and pounds. The extraordinary di&s;|bur&s;ements
of the King amounted to two millions; be&s;ide
above four hundred thou&s;and pounds given in pre&s;ents.
Upon the whole, a &s;ufficient rea&s;on appears, partly from ne|ce&s;&s;ary
expences, partly from want oeconomy, why the
King, even early in his reign, was very deeply involved in
debt, and found great difficulty to &s;upport the government.</P>
<P>FARMERS, not commi&s;&s;ioners, levied the cu&s;toms. It
&s;eems, indeed, requi&s;ite, that the former method &s;hould
always be tried before the latter; though a preferable one.

to twenty-five <HI>per cent.</HI> This practice, &s;o hurtful to in|du&s;try,
prevails &s;till in France, Spain, and mo&s;t countries of
Europe. The cu&s;toms in 1604, yielded 127,000 pounds

630,000 pounds; which, divided among twenty-one years,
makes 30,000 pounds a year. I do not include tho&s;e &s;up|plies,
amounting to 300,000 pounds; which were given
the King by his la&s;t parliament. The&s;e were paid in to their
commi&s;&s;ioners; and the expences of the Spani&s;h war were
much more than &s;ufficient to exhau&s;t them. The di&s;tre&s;&s;ed
family of the Palatine was a great burthen on James, during
part of his reign. The King, it mu&s;t be owned, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed
not frugality, proportioned to the extreme narrowne&s;s of his
revenue. Splendid equipages, however, he did not affect, nor
co&s;tly furniture, nor a luxurious table, nor prodigal mi&s;|tre&s;&s;es.
His buildings too were not &s;umptuous; though the
banquetting-hou&s;e mu&s;t not be forgot, as a monument,
which does honour to his reign. Hunting was his chief
amu&s;ement, the cheape&s;t plea&s;ure in which a King can in|dulge
him&s;elf. His expences were the effects of liberality,
rather than of luxury.</P>
<P>ONE day, it is &s;aid, while he was &s;tanding amid&s;t &s;ome
of his courtiers, a porter pa&s;&s;ed by, loaded with money,
which he was carrying to the trea&s;ury. The King ob&s;erved,
that Rich, afterwards Earl of Holland, one of his hand&s;ome
agreeable favourites, whi&s;pered &s;omewhat to one &s;tanding
near him. Upon enquiry, he found, that Rich had &s;aid,
<HI>How happy would that money make me!</HI> Without he&s;itation,
James be&s;towed it all upon him, though it amounted to
3000 pounds. He added, <HI>You think your&s;elf very happy
in obtaining &s;o large a &s;um; but I am more happy, in
having an opportunity of obliging a worthy man, whom I

SUBSIDIES and fifteenths are frequently mentioned by
hi&s;torians; but neither the amount of the&s;e taxes, nor the
method of impo&s;ing them, have been well explained. It
appears, that the fifteenths formerly corre&s;ponded to the
name, and were that proportinable part of the moveables<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Coke's In&s;t. book iv. cap. i. Of fifteens, quinzins.</NOTE>.
But a valuation being made, during the reign of Edward III.
that valuation was always adhered to, and each town paid
unalterably a particular &s;um, which they them&s;elves a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed
upon the inhabitants. The &s;ame tax in corporate towns
was called a tenth; becau&s;e there it was, at fir&s;t, a tenth
of the moveables. The whole amount of a tenth and fif|teenth
through the kingdom, or a fifteenth, as it is often
more conci&s;ely called, was about 29,000 pounds<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Id. &s;ub&s;idies temporary.</NOTE>. The
amount of a &s;ub&s;idy was not invariable, like that of a fif|teenth.
In the eighth of Elizabeth, a &s;ub&s;idy amounted to
120,000 pounds: In the fortieth, it was not above 78,000<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Journ, 11 July 1610.</NOTE>. It afterwards fell to 70,000; and was continu|ally
decrea&s;ing<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Coke's In&s;t. book iv. chap. I. Sub&s;idies temporary.</NOTE>. The rea&s;on is ea&s;ily collected from the
method of levying it. We may learn from the &s;ub&s;idy
bills<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">See &s;tatutes at large.</NOTE>, that one &s;ub&s;idy was given for four &s;hillings in the
pound on land, and two &s;hillings and eight pence on move|ables
throughout the counties; a con&s;iderable tax, had it
been &s;trictly levied. But this was only the antient &s;tate of
a &s;ub&s;idy. During the reign of James, there was not paid
the twentieth part of that &s;um. The tax was &s;o far per&s;o|nal,
that a man paid only in the county where he lived,
though he &s;hould po&s;&s;e&s;s e&s;tates in other counties; and the
a&s;&s;e&s;&s;or&s; formed a loo&s;e e&s;timation of his property, and
rated him accordingly. To pre&s;erve, however, &s;ome rule
in the e&s;timation, it &s;eems to have been the practice to keep
an eye to former a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ments, and to rate every man accord|ing
as his ance&s;tors, or men of &s;uch an e&s;timated property,
were accu&s;tomed to pay. This was a &s;ufficient rea&s;on, why

&s;ub&s;idies could not increa&s;e, notwith&s;tanding the great in|crea&s;e
of money and ri&s;e of rents. But there was an evi|dent
rea&s;on, why they continually decrea&s;ed. The favour,
as is natural to &s;uppo&s;e, ran always again&s;t the crown;
e&s;pecially during the latter end of Elizabeth, when &s;ub&s;i|dies
became numerous and frequent, and the &s;ums levied
were con&s;iderable, compared to former &s;upplies. The a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors,
though accu&s;tomed to have an eye to antient e&s;timations,
were not bound to ob&s;erve any &s;uch rule; but
might rate anew any per&s;on, according to his pre&s;ent in|come.
When rents fell, or parts of an e&s;tate were &s;old off,
the proprietor was &s;ure to repre&s;ent the&s;e lo&s;&s;es, and obtain a
diminution of his &s;ub&s;idy; but where rents ro&s;e, or new
lands were purcha&s;ed, he kept his own &s;ecret, and paid no
more than formerly. The advantage, therefore, of every
change was taken again&s;t the crown; and the crown could
obtain the advantage of none. And to make the matter
wor&s;e, the alterations, which happened in property during
this age, were, in general, unfavourable to the crown. The
&s;mall proprietors, or twenty pound men, went continually
to decay; and when their e&s;tates were &s;wallowed up by a
greater, the new purcha&s;er increa&s;ed not his &s;ub&s;idy. So
loo&s;e indeed is the whole method of rating &s;ub&s;idies, that the
wonder was not how the tax &s;hould continually dimini&s;h;
but how it yielded any revenue at all. It became at la&s;t &s;o
unequal and uncertain, that the parliament was obliged to
change it for a land tax.</P>
<P>THE price of corn, during this reign, and by con&s;e|quence,
that of the other nece&s;&s;aries of life, was no lower,
or was rather higher, than at pre&s;ent. By a proclamation
of James, e&s;tabli&s;hing public magazine&s;, whenever wheat
fell below thirty-two &s;hillings a quarter, rye below eighteen,
barley below &s;ixteen, the commi&s;&s;ioners were empowered to
purcha&s;e corn for the magazines<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Rymer, tom. xvii. p. 526.</NOTE>. The&s;e prices then are
to be regarded as low; though they would pa&s;&s; for high
<PB N="117" REF="145">
by our pre&s;ent e&s;timation. The be&s;t wool, during the
greate&s;t part of James's reign, was at thirty-three &s;hillings a
tod: At pre&s;ent, it is not above two-thirds of that value;
though it is to be pre&s;umed, that our exports in woollen
goods are con&s;iderably increa&s;ed. The finer manufactures
too, by the progre&s;s of art and indu&s;try, have rather di|mini&s;hed,
notwith&s;tanding the great increa&s;e of money. In
Shake&s;pear, the ho&s;te&s;s tells Fal&s;taff, that the &s;hirts &s;he
bought him were holland at eight &s;hillings a yard; a very
high price at this day, even &s;uppo&s;ing, what is not proba|ble,
that the be&s;t holland at that time was equal in good|ne&s;s
to the be&s;t which can now be purcha&s;ed. In like man|ner,
a yard of velvet, about the middle of Elizabeth's reign,
was valued at two and twenty &s;hillings<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">See a compendium or dialogue in&s;erted in the Memoirs of Wool, chap. 23.</NOTE>. I have not been

article of food, and its price regulates that of every thing
el&s;e, we may pre&s;ume, that cattle bore a high value as well
as corn. Be&s;ides, we mu&s;t con&s;ider, that the general turn
of that age, which no laws could prevent, was the con|verting
arable land into pa&s;ture: A certain proof that the
latter was found more profitable, and con&s;equently that all
butcher's meat, as well as bread, was con&s;iderably higher
than at pre&s;ent. We have a regulation of the market with

The city of London procured officers, who had &s;erved

Artillery garden; a practice which had been di&s;continued
&s;ince 1588. All the counties of England, in emulation of
the capital, were fond of &s;howing a well ordered and well

<P>THE di&s;orders of Ireland obliged James to keep up &s;ome
forces there, and put him to a great expence. The com|mon
pay of a private man in the infantry was eight pence a
day, a lieutenant two &s;hillings, an en&s;ign eighteen pence<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ry|mer, tom. xvi. p. 717.</NOTE>.
The armies in Europe were not near &s;o numerous, during
that age; and the private men, we may ob&s;erve, were
drawn from a better rank than at pre&s;ent, and approaching
nearer to that of the officers<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">In older times, &s;oldiers were &s;till of a higher rank. The Duke of Clarence, &s;on to Edward III. when Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, had for the pay of his army the&s;e appointments.

<P>IN the year 1583, there was a general review made of all
the men in England capable of bearing arms; and the&s;e
were found to amount to 1,172000 men, according to
Raleigh<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Of the invention of &s;hipping. This number is much &s;uperior to that contained in Marden, and delivered by Sir Edward Coke to the hou&s;e of commons; and is more likely.</NOTE>. It is impo&s;&s;ible to warrant the exactne&s;s of this
computation; or rather, we may fairly pre&s;ume it to be
&s;omewhat inaccurate. But if it approached near the truth,
England has probably, &s;ince that time, increa&s;ed much in
populou&s;ne&s;s. The growth of London, in riches and
<PB N="120" REF="148">
beauty, as well as numbers of inhabitants, has been prodi|gious.
From 1600, it doubled every forty years<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Sir William Petty.</NOTE>; and
con&s;equently in 1680, it contained four times as many in|habitants,
as at the beginning of the century. It has ever
been the center of all the trade in the kingdom; and almo&s;t
the only town which affords &s;ociety and amu&s;ement. The
affection, which the Engli&s;h bear to a country life, makes
the provincial towns be little frequented by the gentry.
Nothing but the allurements of the capital, which is fa|voured
by the re&s;idence of the king, by being the &s;eat of
government, and of all the courts of ju&s;tice, can prevail
over their pa&s;&s;ion for their rural villas.</P>
<P>LONDON, at this time, was almo&s;t intirely built of wood,
and in every re&s;pect was certainly a very ugly city. The Earl
of Arundel fir&s;t introduced the practice of brick buildings<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Sir Edward Walker's political di&s;cour&s;es, p. 270.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE navy of England was e&s;teemed very formidable in

<P>EVERY &s;e&s;&s;ion of parliament,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Commerce.</NOTE> during this whole reign,
we meet with grievous lamentations of the decay of trade
and the growth of popery: Such violent propen&s;ity have
men to complain of the pre&s;ent times, and to entertain di&s;|contents
again&s;t their fortune and condition. The King

at a lo&s;s to account for the total want of money, which he
heard &s;o much exaggerated<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Rymer, tom. xvii. p. 413.</NOTE>. It may, however, be affirmed,
that, during no preceding period of Engli&s;h hi&s;tory, was
there a more &s;en&s;ible increa&s;e, than during the reign of this
monarch, of all the advantages which di&s;tinguish a flou|ri&s;hing

was favourable to indu&s;try and commerce: His turn of mind

<P>NINE tenths of the commerce of the kingdom con&s;i&s;ted
in woollen goods<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Journ. 26 May 1621.</NOTE>. Wool, however, was allowed to be
exported, till the 19th of the King. Its exportation was
then forbid by proclamation; tho' that edict was never
&s;trictly executed. Mo&s;t of the cloth was exported raw,
and was dyed and dre&s;&s;ed by the Dutch; who gained, 'tis
pretended, 700,000 pounds a year by this manufacture<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Journ. 20th May 1614. Raleigh, in his ob&s;ervations, computers the lo&s;s at 400,000 pounds to the na|tion.

to have been premature.</P>
<P>IN &s;o little credit was the fine Engli&s;h cloth even at home,
that the King was obliged to &s;eek expedients, by which he
might engage the people of fa&s;hion to wear it<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Rymer, tom. xvii. p. 415.</NOTE>. The
manufacture of fine linen was totally unknown in the king|dom<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Id. ibid.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE company of merchant-adventurers, by their patent,
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the &s;ole commerce of woollen goods, tho' the &s;taple
commodity of the nation. An attempt, made during the
reign of Elizabeth, to lay open this important trade, had
been attended with bad con&s;equences for a time, by a con|&s;piracy
of the merchant-adventurers, not to make any pur|cha&s;es
of cloth; and the Queen immediately re&s;tored them
their patent.</P>
<P>THEY were groundle&s;s fears of a like accident, that en|&s;laved
the nation to tho&s;e exclu&s;ive companies, which con|fined
&s;o much every branch of commerce and indu&s;try.
The parliament, however, annulled, in the third of the
King, the patent of the Spani&s;h company; and the trade
to Spain, which was, at fir&s;t, very in&s;ignificant, &s;oon be|came
the mo&s;t con&s;iderable in the kingdom. 'Tis &s;trange
that they were not thence encouraged to aboli&s;h all the
other companies, and that they went no farther than ob|liging
them to enlarge their bottom, and to facilitate the
admi&s;&s;ion of new adventurers.</P>
<P>A BOARD of trade was erected by the King in 1622<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Id. p. 410.</NOTE>. One of the rea&s;ons, a&s;&s;igned in the commi&s;&s;ion, is to re|medy
the low price of wools, which begot complaints of
the decay of the woollen manufactory. 'Tis more pro|bable,
however, that this fall of prices proceeded from the
increa&s;e of wool. The King likewi&s;e recommends it to the
<PB N="124" REF="152">
commi&s;&s;ioners to inquire and examine, whether a greater
freedom of trade and an exemption from the re&s;traint of
exclu&s;ive companies, would not be beneficial. Men were
then fettered by their own prejudices; and the King was
ju&s;tly afraid of embracing a bold mea&s;ure, the con&s;equences
of which might be uncertain. The dige&s;ting of a naviga|tion
act, of a like nature with the famous one executed
afterwards by the republican parliament, is likewi&s;e recom|mended
to the commi&s;&s;ioners. The arbitrary powers, then
commonly a&s;&s;umed by the privy council, appear evidently
thro' the whole tenor of the commi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>THE &s;ilk manufacture had no footing in England: But,
by James's direction, mulberry-trees were planted, and &s;ilk|worms
introduced<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Stowe.</NOTE>. The climate &s;eems unfavourable to
the execution of this project.</P>
<P>GREENLAND is thought to have been di&s;covered during
this reign; and the whale-fi&s;hery was carried on with great
&s;ucce&s;s: But the indu&s;try of the Dutch, in &s;pite of all op|po&s;ition,
&s;oon deprived the Engli&s;h of this &s;ource of riches.
A company was erected for the di&s;covery of the north-we&s;t
pa&s;&s;age; and many fruitle&s;s attempts were made for that
purpo&s;e. In &s;uch noble projects, de&s;pair ought never to be
admitted, till the ab&s;olute impo&s;&s;ibility of &s;ucce&s;s be fully
a&s;certained.</P>
<P>THE pa&s;&s;age to the Ea&s;t-Indies had been opened to the
Engli&s;h during the reign of Elizabeth; but the trade to
tho&s;e parts of the world was not intirely e&s;tabli&s;hed till this
reign, when the Ea&s;t India company received a new patent,
enlarged their &s;tock to 1,500,000 pounds<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Journ. 26th Nov. 1621.</NOTE>, and fitted out
&s;everal &s;hips on the&s;e adventures. In 1609 they built a
ve&s;&s;el of 1200 ton, the large&s;t merchant-&s;hip which Eng|land
had ever known. She was unfortunate, and peri&s;hed
by &s;hipwreck. In 1611, a large &s;hip of the company, a&s;|&s;i&s;ted
by a pinnace, maintained five &s;everal engagements
<PB N="125" REF="153">
with a &s;quadron of Portugue&s;e, and gained a complete vic|tory
over forces much &s;uperior. During the following
years, the Dutch company were guilty of great injuries to|wards
the Engli&s;h, in expelling many of their factors, and
de&s;troying their &s;ettlements: But the&s;e violences were re|&s;ented
with a proper &s;pirit by the court of England. A na|val
force was equipped under the Earl of Oxford<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">In 1622.</NOTE>, and
lay in wait for the return of the Dutch Ea&s;t-India fleet.
By rea&s;on of cro&s;s winds, Oxford failed of his purpo&s;e, and
the Dutch e&s;caped. Some time after, one &s;hip, full of
riches, was taken by Vice-admiral Merwin; and it was
&s;ti|pulated by the Dutch to pay 70,000 pounds to the Engli&s;h
company, in con&s;ideration of the injuries which that com|pany
had &s;u&s;tained<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">John&s;toni hi&s;t. lib. 19.</NOTE>. But neither this &s;tipulation, nor the
fear of repri&s;als, nor the &s;en&s;e of that friend&s;hip which &s;ub|&s;i&s;ted
between England and the &s;tates, could re&s;train the
avidity of the Dutch company, or render them equitable in
their proceedings towards their allies. Impatient to have
&s;ole po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the &s;pice-trade, which the Engli&s;h then
&s;hared with them, they a&s;&s;umed a juri&s;diction over a factory
of the latter in the i&s;land of Amboyna; and on very impro|bable,
and even ab&s;urd pretences, &s;eized all the factors with
their families, and put them to death with the mo&s;t inhu|man
tortures. This di&s;mal news arrived in England at the
time when James, by the prejudices of his &s;ubjects and the
intrigues of his favourite, was con&s;trained to make a breach
with Spain; and he was obliged, after &s;ome remon&s;trances,
to acquie&s;ce in this indignity from a &s;tate, who&s;e alliance
was now become nece&s;&s;ary to him. 'Tis remarkable that
the nation, almo&s;t without a murmur, &s;ubmitted to this
injury from their prote&s;tant confederates; an injury, which,
be&s;ides the horrid enormity of the action, was of much
deeper importance to national intere&s;t, than all tho&s;e which
they were &s;o impatient to re&s;ent from the hou&s;e of Au|&s;tria.</P>

WHAT chiefly renders the reign of James memorable,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Colonies.</NOTE> is
the commencement of the Engli&s;h colonies in America; co|lonies
e&s;tabli&s;hed on the noble&s;t footing that has been known
in any age or nation. The Spaniards, being the fir&s;t di&s;co|verers
of the new world, immediately took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the
precious mines which they found there; and, by the allure|ment
of great riches, they were tempted to depopulate their
own country as well as that which they conquered; and
added the vice of &s;loth to tho&s;e of avidity and barbarity,
which had attended their adventurers in tho&s;e renowned en|terprizes.
That fine coa&s;t was intirely neglected, which
reaches from St. Augu&s;tine to Cape Breton, and which lies
in all the temperate climates, is watered by noble rivers, and
offers a fertile &s;oil, but nothing more, to the indu&s;trious
pl&aacute;nter. Peopled gradually from England by the nece&s;&s;itous
and indigent, who, at home, increa&s;ed neither wealth nor
populou&s;ne&s;s, the colonies, which were planted along that
tract, have promoted the navigation, encouraged the in|du&s;try,
and even multiplied the inhabitants of their mother-country.
The &s;pirit of independency, which was reviving
in England, here &s;hone forth in its full lu&s;tre, and received
new acce&s;&s;ion of force from the a&s;piring character of tho&s;e,
who, being di&s;contented with the e&s;tabli&s;hed church and
monarchy, had &s;ought for freedom amid&s;t tho&s;e &s;avage de|&s;arts.</P>
<P>QUEEN Elizabeth had done little more than given a name
to the continent of Virginia; and, after her planting one
feeble colony, which quickly decayed, that country was in|tirely
abandoned. But when peace put an end to the mili|tary
enterprizes again&s;t Spain, and left ambitious &s;pirits no
hopes of making any longer &s;uch quick advances towards
honour and fortune, the nation began to &s;econd the pacific
intentions of its monarch, and to &s;eek a &s;urer, tho' &s;lower
expedient, for acquiring riches and glory. In 1606, New|port
carried over a colony, and began a &s;ettlement; which
the company, erected by patent for that purpo&s;e in London
<PB N="127" REF="157">
and Bri&s;tol, took care to &s;upply with yearly recruits of pro|vi&s;ions,
uten&s;ils, and new inhabitants. About 1609, Ar|gal
di&s;covered a more direct and &s;horter pa&s;&s;age to Vir|ginia,
and left the tract of the antient navigators, who had
fir&s;t directed their cour&s;e &s;outhwards to the tropic, &s;ailed
we&s;tward by means of the trade winds, and then turned
northward, till they reached the Engli&s;h &s;ettlements. The
&s;ame year, five hundred per&s;ons under Sir Thomas Gates
and Sir George Somers were embarked for Virginia. So|mers's
&s;hip, meeting with a tempe&s;t, was driven into Ber|mudas,
and laid the foundation of a &s;ettlement in tho&s;e
i&s;lands. Lord Delawar afterwards undertook the govern|ment
of the Engli&s;h colonies: But notwith&s;tanding all his
care, &s;econded by &s;upplies from James, and by money
rai&s;ed from the fir&s;t lottery ever known in the kingdom,
&s;uch difficulties attended the &s;ettlement of the&s;e countries,
that, in 1614, there were not alive more than 400 men,
of all that had been &s;ent thither. After &s;upplying them|&s;elves
with provi&s;ions more immediately nece&s;&s;ary for the
&s;upport of life, the new planters began the cultivating to|bacco;
and James, notwith&s;tanding his antipathy to that
drug, gave them permi&s;&s;ion to enter it in England; and he
inhibited by proclamation all importation from Spain<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Rymer, tom. xviii. p. 621, 633.</NOTE>. By
degrees, new colonies were e&s;tabli&s;hed in that continent, and
gave new names to the places where they &s;ettled, leaving
that of Virginia to the province fir&s;t planted. The i&s;land
of Barbadoes was al&s;o planted in this reign.</P>
<P>SPECULATIVE rea&s;oners, during that age, rai&s;ed many
objections to the planting tho&s;e remote colonies; and fore|told,
that, after draining their mother-country of inhabit|ants,
they would &s;oon &s;hake off her yoke, and erect an in|dependent
government in America: But time has &s;hown,
that the views, entertained by tho&s;e who encouraged &s;uch
generous undertakings, were more ju&s;t and &s;olid. A mild
government and great naval force have pre&s;erved, and may
<PB N="128" REF="158">
long pre&s;erve the dominion of England over her colonies.
And &s;uch advantage have commerce and navigation reaped
from the&s;e e&s;tabli&s;hments, that more than a fourth of the
Engli&s;h &s;hipping is at pre&s;ent computed to be employed in
carrying on the traffick with the American &s;ettlements.</P>
<P>AGRICULTURE was antiently very imperfect in England.
The &s;udden tran&s;itions, &s;o often mentioned by hi&s;torians,
from the lowe&s;t to the highe&s;t prices of grain, and the pro|digious
inequality of its value in different years, are &s;uffi|cients
proofs, that the produce depended intirely on the
&s;ea&s;on, and that art had as yet done nothing to fence again&s;t
the injuries of the heavens. During this reign, con&s;ider|able
improvements were made, as in mo&s;t arts, &s;o in this,
the mo&s;t beneficial of any. A numerous catalogue might be
formed of books and pamphlets, treating of hu&s;bandry,
which were wrote about this time. The nation, however,
was &s;till dependent on foreigners for daily bread; and tho'
its exportation of grain now forms a con&s;iderable branch of
its commerce, notwith&s;tanding its increa&s;e of people, there
was in that period, a regular import from the Baltic as well
as from France; and if ever it &s;topped, the bad con&s;e|quences
were very &s;en&s;ibly felt by the nation. Sir Walter
Raleigh in his ob&s;ervations computes, that two millions
went out at one time for corn. It was not till the fifth of
Elizabeth, that the exportation of corn had ever been al|lowed
in England; and Camden ob&s;erves, that agriculture,
from that moment, received new life and vigour.</P>
<P>THE endeavours of James, or, more properly &s;peaking,
tho&s;e of the nation, for the promotion of trade, were at|tended
with greater &s;ucce&s;s than tho&s;e for the encourage|ment
of learning. Tho' the age was by no means de&s;titute
of eminent writers, a very bad ta&s;te in general prevailed
during that period; and the monarch him&s;elf was not a
little infected with it.</P>

by an amiable &s;implicity, which, whatever rude|ne&s;s
may &s;ometimes attend it, is &s;o fitted to expre&s;s the ge|nuine
movements of nature and pa&s;&s;ion, that the compo&s;i|tions
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of it mu&s;t for ever appear valuable to the
di&s;cerning part of mankind. The glaring figures of di&s;|cour&s;e,
the pointed antithe&s;is, the unnatural conceit, the
jingle of words; &s;uch fal&s;e ornaments were not employed
by early writers; not becau&s;e they were rejected, but be|cau&s;e
they &s;carce ever occurred to them. An ea&s;y, unforced
&s;train of &s;entiment runs thro' their compo&s;itions; tho' at
the &s;ame time we may ob&s;erve, that, amid&s;t the mo&s;t ele|gant
&s;implicity of thought and expre&s;&s;ion, one is &s;ometimes
&s;urpri&s;ed to meet with a poor conceit, which had pre&s;ented
it&s;elf un&s;ought for, and which the author had not acquired
critical ob&s;ervation enough to condemn<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">The name of Polynices, one of Oedipus's &s;ons, means in the original <HI>much quarrelling.</HI> In the altercations betwixt the two brothers, in &AElig;&s;chylus, Sophocles, and Euripides, this conceit is employed; and 'tis remarkable, that &s;o poor a conundrum could not be rejected by any of the&s;e three poets, &s;o ju&s;tly celebrated for their ta&s;te and &s;implicity. What could Shake&s;peare have done wor&s;e? Terence has his <HI>inceptio e&s;t amentium, non amantium.</HI> Many &s;imilar in&s;tances will occur to the learned. 'Tis well known that Ari&s;totle treats very &s;eriou&s;ly of puns, divides them into &s;everal cla&s;&s;es, and recom|mends the u&s;e of them to orators.</NOTE>. A bad ta&s;te
&s;eizes with avidity the&s;e frivolous beauties, and even per|haps
a good ta&s;te, ere &s;urfeited by them: They multiply
every day more and more in the fa&s;hionable compo&s;itions:
Nature and good &s;en&s;e are neglected: Laboured ornaments
&s;tudied and admired: And a total degeneracy of &s;tyle and
language prepares the way for barbari&s;m and ignorance.
Hence the A&s;iatic manner was found to depart &s;o much
from the &s;imple purity of Athens: Hence that tin&s;el elo|quence,
which is ob&s;ervable in many of the Roman writers,
from which Cicero him&s;elf is not wholly exempted, and
which &s;o much prevails in Ovid, Seneca, Lucan, Martial,
and the Plinys.</P>

ON the revival of letters, when the judgment of the
public is as yet raw and unformed, this fal&s;e gli&s;ter catches
the eye, and leaves no room, either in eloquence or poetry,
for the durable beauties of &s;olid &s;en&s;e and lively pa&s;&s;ion.
The reigning genius is then diametrically oppo&s;ite to that
which prevails on the fir&s;t origin of arts. The Italian wri|ters,
'tis evident, even the mo&s;t celebrated, have not reached
the proper &s;implicity of thought and compo&s;ition; and in
Petrarch, Ta&s;&s;o, Guarini, frivolous wittici&s;ms and forced
conceits are but too predominant. The period, during
which letters were cultivated in Italy, was &s;o &s;hort as &s;carce
to allow lei&s;ure for correcting this adulterated reli&s;h.</P>
<P>THE more early French writers are liable to the &s;ame re|proach.
Voiture, Balzac, even Corneille, have too much
affected tho&s;e ambitious ornaments, of which the Italians in
general, and the lea&s;t pure of the antients, &s;upplied them
with &s;o many models. And it was not till late, that ob|&s;ervation
and reflection gave ri&s;e to a more natural turn of
thought and compo&s;ition among that elegant people.</P>
<P>A LIKE character may be extended to the fir&s;t Engli&s;h
writers; &s;uch as flouri&s;hed during the reign of Elizabeth
and James, and even till long afterwards. Learning, on its
revival in this i&s;land, was attired in the &s;ame unnatural
garb, which it wore at the time of its decay among the
Greeks and Romans. And, what may be regarded as a
misfortune, the Engli&s;h writers were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of great ge|nius
before they were endued with any degree of ta&s;te, and
by that means gave a kind of &s;anction to tho&s;e forced turns
and &s;entiments which they &s;o much affected. Their di&s;|torted
conceptions are attended with &s;uch vigour of mind,
that we admire the imagination which produced them, as
much as we blame the want of judgment which gave them
admittance. To enter into an exact critici&s;m of the writers
of that age, would exceed our pre&s;ent purpo&s;e. A &s;hort
character of the mo&s;t eminent, delivered with the &s;ame free|dom
which hi&s;tory exerci&s;es over kings and mini&s;ters, may
<PB N="131" REF="161">
not be improper. The national prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, which pre|vail,
may perhaps render the former liberty not the lea&s;t pe|rilous
for an author.</P>
<P>IF Shake&s;peare be con&s;idered as a MAN, born in a rude
age, and educated in the lowe&s;t manner, without any in|&s;truction,
either from the world or from books, he may be
regarded as a prodigy: If repre&s;ented as a POET, capable
of furni&s;hing a proper entertainment to a refined or intelli|gent
audience, we mu&s;t abate &s;omewhat of this eulogy. In
his compo&s;itions, we regret, that many irregularities, and
even &s;ometimes ab&s;urdities &s;hould &s;o frequently disfigure the
animated and pa&s;&s;ionate &s;cenes intermixed with them; and
at the &s;ame time, we perhaps admire the more tho&s;e beau|ties,
on account of their being &s;urrounded with &s;uch de|formities.
A &s;triking peculiarity of &s;entiment, adapted to a
&s;ingular character, he frequently hits, as it were by in&s;pira|tion;
but a rea&s;onable propriety of thought he cannot, for
any time, uphold. Nervous and picture&s;que expre&s;&s;ions,
as well as de&s;criptions, abound in him; but 'tis in vain we
look either for continued purity or &s;implicity of diction.
His total ignorance of all theatrical art and conduct, how|ever
material a defect; yet, as it affects the &s;pectator rather
than the reader, we can more readily excu&s;e, than that want
of ta&s;te which often prevails in his productions, and which
gives way, only by intervals, to the irradiations of genius.
A great and fertile genius he certainly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, and one
enriched equally with a tragic and comic vein; but, he
ought to be cited as a proof, how dangerous it is to rely
on the&s;e advantages alone for the attaining an excellence in
the finer arts<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Invenire etiam barbari &s;olent, di&s;ponere et ornare non ni&s;i$cruditus. <HI>PLIN.</HI></NOTE>. And there may even remain a &s;u&s;picion,
that we over-rate, if po&s;&s;ible, the greatne&s;s of his genius;
in the &s;ame manner as bodies often appear more gigantic, on
account of their being di&s;proportioned and mi&s;hapen. He
died in 1617, aged 53 years.</P>

JOHNSON po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed all the learning which was wanting to
Shake&s;peare, and wanted all the genius of which the other
was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed. Both of them were equally deficient in
ta&s;te and elegance, in harmony and correctne&s;s. A &s;ervile
copi&s;t of the antients, John&s;on tran&s;lated into bad Engli&s;h
the beautiful pa&s;&s;ages of the Greek and Roman authors,
without accommodating them to the manners of his age and
country. His merit has been totally eclip&s;ed by that of
Shake&s;peare, who&s;e rude genius prevailed over the rude art
of his cotemporary. The Engli&s;h theatre has ever &s;ince
taken a &s;trong tincture of Shake&s;peare's &s;pirit and character;
and thence it has proceeded, that the nation have undergone,
from all their neighbours, the reproach of barbari&s;m, from
which their many valuable productions in other parts of
learning would otherwi&s;e have exempted them. John&s;on
had a pen&s;ion of a hundred marks from the King, which
Charles afterwards augmented to a hundred pounds. He
died in 1637, aged 63.</P>
<P>FAIRFAX has tran&s;lated Ta&s;&s;o with an elegance and ea&s;e,
and, at the &s;ame time, with an exactne&s;s, which, for that
age, are &s;urpri&s;ing. Each line in the original is faithfully
rendered by a corre&s;pondent line in the tran&s;lation. Har|rington's
tran&s;lation of Ario&s;to is not likewi&s;e without its
merit. 'Tis to be regretted, that the&s;e poets &s;hould have
imitated the Italians in their &s;tanza, which has a prolixity and
uniformity in it, that di&s;plea&s;es in long performances. They
had otherwi&s;e, as well as Spencer, who went before them,
contributed much to the poli&s;hing and refining the Engli&s;h
ver&s;ification.</P>
<P>IN Donne's &s;atires, when carefully in&s;pected, there appear
&s;ome fla&s;hes of wit and ingenuity; but the&s;e totally &s;uffo|cated
and buried by the har&s;he&s;t and mo&s;t uncouth expre&s;|&s;ion
which is any-where to be met with.</P>
<P>IF the poetry of the Engli&s;h was &s;o rude and imperfect
during that age, we may rea&s;onably expect that their pro&s;e
<PB N="133" REF="163">
would be liable to &s;till greater objections. Tho' the latter
appears the more ea&s;y, as it is the more natural method of
compo&s;ition; it has ever in practice been found the more
rare and difficult; and there &s;carce is an in&s;tance, in any
language, that it has reached a degree of perfection, before
the refinement of poetical numbers and expre&s;&s;ion. Engli&s;h
pro&s;e, during the reign of James, was wrote with little regard
to the rules of grammar, and with a total di&s;regard of the
elegance and harmony of the period. Stuffed with Latin
&s;entences and citations, it likewi&s;e imitated tho&s;e inver&s;ions,
which, however forcible and graceful in the antient lan|guages,
are intirely contrary to the idiom of the Engli&s;h.
I &s;hall indeed venture to affirm, that, whatever uncouth
phra&s;es and expre&s;&s;ions occur in old books, they were owing
chiefly to the unformed ta&s;te of the author; and that the
language, &s;poke in the courts of Elizabeth and James, was
very little different from that which we meet with at pre&s;ent
in good company. Of this opinion, the little &s;craps of
&s;peeches which are found in the parliamentary journals, and
which carry an air &s;o oppo&s;ite to the laboured orations, &s;eem
to be a &s;ufficient proof; and there want not productions of
that age, which, being wrote by men who were not authors
by profe&s;&s;ion, retain a very natural manner, and may give
us &s;ome idea of the language which prevailed among men
of the world. I &s;hall particularly mention Sir John Davis's
di&s;covery, Throgmorton's, Effex's, and Nevile's letters.</P>
<P>THE great glory of literature in this i&s;land, during the
reign of James, was my Lord Bacon. Mo&s;t of his perform|ances
were compo&s;ed in Latin; tho' he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed neither the
elegance of that, nor of his native tongue. If we con&s;ider
the variety of talents di&s;played by this man; as a public
&s;peaker, a man of bu&s;ine&s;s, a wit, a courtier, a companion,
an author, a philo&s;opher; he is ju&s;tly the object of great
admiration. If we con&s;ider him merely as an author and
philo&s;opher, the light in which we view him at pre&s;ent, tho'
very e&s;timable, he was yet inferior to his cotemporary Gali|laeo,
<PB N="134" REF="164">
perhaps even to Kepler. Bacon pointed out at a di&s;|tance
the road to true philo&s;ophy: Galilaeo both pointed
it out to others, and made him&s;elf con&s;iderable advances in
it. The Engli&s;hman was ignorant of geometry: The Flo|rentine
revived that &s;cience, excelled in it, and was the fir&s;t
who applied it, together with experiment, to natural philo|&s;ophy.
The former rejected, with the mo&s;t po&s;itive di&s;|dain,
the &s;y&s;tem of Copernicus: The latter &s;ortified it with
new proofs, derived both from rea&s;on and the &s;en&s;es. Ba|con's
&s;tyle is &s;tiff and rigid: His wit, tho' often brilliant, is
&s;ometimes unnatural and far-fetched; and he &s;eems to be the
original of tho&s;e pointed &s;imilies and long-&s;pun allegories,
which &s;o much di&s;tingui&s;h the Engli&s;h authors: Galilaeo is a
lively and agreeable, tho' &s;omewhat a prolix writer. But
Italy, not united in any &s;ingle government, and perhaps fa|tiated
with that literary glory, which it has po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed both
in antient and modern times, has too much neglected the
renown which it has acquired by giving birth to &s;o great
a man. That national &s;pirit, which prevails among the
Engli&s;h, and which forms their great happine&s;s, is the cau&s;e
why they be&s;tow on all their eminent writers, and on Bacon
among the re&s;t, &s;uch prai&s;es and acclamations, as may often
appear partial and exce&s;&s;ive. He died in 1626, in the 66th
year of his age.</P>
<P>IF the reader of Raleigh's hi&s;tory can have the patience to
wade thro' the Jewi&s;h and Rabbinical learning which com|po&s;e
the half of the volume, he will find, when he comes to
the Greek and Roman &s;tory, that his pains are not unre|warded.
Raleigh is the be&s;t model of that antient &s;tyle,
which &s;ome writers would affect to revive at pre&s;ent. He
was beheaded in 1618, aged 66 years.</P>
<P>CAMDEN'S hi&s;tory of Queen Elizabeth may be e&s;teemed
good compo&s;ition, both for the &s;tyle and the matter. It
is wrote with &s;implicity of expre&s;&s;ion, very rare in that age,
and with a regard to truth. It would not perhaps be too
much to affirm, that it is among the be&s;t hi&s;torical produc|tions
<PB N="135" REF="165">
which have yet been compo&s;ed by any Engli&s;hman.
'Tis well known that the Engli&s;h have not much excelled in
that kind of literature. He died in 1623, aged 73 years.</P>
<P>WE &s;hall mention the king him&s;elf at the end of the&s;e
Engli&s;h writers; becau&s;e that is <HI>his</HI> place, when con&s;idered
as an author. It may &s;afely be affirmed, that the mediocrity
of James's talent in literature, joined to the great change in
national ta&s;te, is the chief cau&s;e of that contempt under
which his memory labours, and which is often carried by
party-writers to a great extreme. 'Tis remarkable, how
different from ours were the &s;entiments of the antients with
regard to learning. Of the fir&s;t twenty Roman emperors,
counting from Cae&s;ar to Severus, above the half were au|thors;
and tho' few of them &s;eem to have been eminent in
that profe&s;&s;ion, it is always remarked to their prai&s;e, that,
by their example, they encouraged literature. Not to men|tion
Germanicus, and his daughter Agrippina, per&s;ons &s;o
nearly allied to the throne, the greater part of the cla&s;&s;ic
writers, who&s;e works remain, were men of the highe&s;t qua|lity.
As every human advantage is attended with inconve|niences
the change $word$ ideas in this particular may
probably be a&s;cribed to the invention of printing; which
has rendered books &s;o common, that men even of &s;lender
fortunes can have acce&s;s to them.</P>
<P>THAT James was but a middling writer may be allowed:
That he was a contemptible one can by no means be ad|mitted.
Whoever will read his Ba&s;ilicon Doron, particularly
the two la&s;t books, the true law of free monarchies, his an|&s;wer
to Cardinal Perron, and almo&s;t all his &s;peeches and me&s;|&s;ages
to parliament, will confe&s;s him to have po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed no
mean genius. If he wrote concerning witches and appari|tions;
who, in that age, did not admit the reality of the&s;e
fictitious beings? If he has compo&s;ed a commentary on the
Revelations, and proved the Pope to be Antichri&s;t; may
not a &s;imilar reproach be extended to the famous Napier;

and even to Newton, at a time when learning was much
more advanced than during the reign of James? From the
gro&s;&s;ne&s;s of its &s;uper&s;titions, we may infer the ignorance of
an age; but never &s;hould pronounce concerning the folly of
an individual, from his admitting popular errors, con&s;ecrated
with the appearance of religion.</P>
<P>SUCH a &s;uperiority do the pur&s;uits of literature po&s;&s;e&s;s
above every other occupation, that even he, who attains but
a mediocrity in them, merits the pre-eminence above tho&s;e
who excel the mo&s;t in the common and vulgar profe&s;&s;ions.
The &s;peaker of the hou&s;e of commons is u&s;ually an eminent
man; yet the harangue of his Maje&s;ty we &s;hall always find
much &s;uperior to that of the &s;peaker, in every parliament
during this reign.</P>
<P>EVERY &s;cience, as well as polite literature, mu&s;t be con|&s;idered
as being yet in its infancy. Schola&s;tic learning and
polemical divinity retarded the growth of all true knowlege.
Sir Henry Saville, in the preamble of that deed by which
he annexed a &s;alary to the mathematical and a&s;tronomical
profe&s;&s;ors in Oxford, &s;ays, that geometry was almo&s;t totally
abandoned and unknown in England<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Rymer, tom. xvii. p. 217.</NOTE>. The be&s;t learning
of that age was the &s;tudy of the antients. Ca&s;aubon, emi|nent
for this knowlege, was invited over from France by
James, and encouraged by a pen&s;ion of 300 a year, as well
as by church preferments<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Id. p. 709.</NOTE>. The famous Antonio di Do|minis,
Archbi&s;hop of Spalato, no de&s;picable philo&s;opher,
came likewi&s;e into England; and afforded great triumph to
the nation, by their gaining &s;o con&s;iderable a pro&s;elyte from
the papi&s;ts. But the mortification followed &s;oon after. For
the Archbi&s;hop, tho' advanced to &s;ome eccle&s;ia&s;tical prefer|ments<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Id. p. 95.</NOTE>,
received not encouragement &s;ufficient to &s;atisfy his

<P>THE hou&s;e of commons accordingly took into con&s;idera|tion
the bu&s;ine&s;s of &s;upply. They knew that all the money
granted by the la&s;t parliament had been expended on naval
and military armaments; and that great anticipations were
likewi&s;e made on the revenues of the crown. They were
not ignorant that Charles was loaded with a large debt, con|tracted
by his father, who had borrowed money both from
his own &s;ubjects and from foreign princes. They had
learned by experience, that the public revenues could with
difficulty maintain the dignity of the crown, even under the
ordinary charges of government. They were &s;en&s;ible that
the pre&s;ent war was, very lately, the re&s;ult of their own
importunate applications and entreaties, and that they had
&s;olemnly engaged to &s;upport their &s;overeign in the manage|ment
of it. They were acquainted with the difficulty of
military enterprizes, directed again&s;t the whole hou&s;e of

again&s;t the Emperor Ferdinand, hitherto the mo&s;t

declared openly their true rea&s;on. We &s;hall, therefore, ap|proach
nearer the truth, if we mention all the views which
the pre&s;ent conjuncture could &s;ugge&s;t to them.</P>
<P>IT is not to be doubted, but &s;pleen and ill-will again&s;t
the Duke of Buckingham had a great influence with many.
So va&s;t and rapid a fortune, &s;o little merited, could not fail
to excite public envy; and, however men's hatred might
have been &s;u&s;pended for a moment, while the Duke's con|duct
&s;eemed to gratify their pa&s;&s;ions and their prejudices, it
was impo&s;&s;ible for him long to pre&s;erve the affections of the
people. His influence over the mode&s;ty of Charles exceeded
even that which he had acquired over the weakne&s;s of James;
nor was any public mea&s;ure conducted but by his coun&s;el
and direction. His impetuous temper prompted him to
<PB N="140" REF="172">
rai&s;e &s;uddenly, to the highe&s;t elevation, his flatterers and
dependents: And, upon the lea&s;t occa&s;ion of di&s;plea&s;ure,
he threw them down with equal fury and violence. Impla|cable
in his hatred; fickle in his friend&s;hips: All men were
either regarded as his enemies, or dreaded &s;oon to become
&s;uch. The whole power of the kingdom was gra&s;ped by
his infatiable hand; while he both engro&s;&s;ed the intire con|fidence
of his ma&s;ter, and held, inve&s;ted in his &s;ingle per|&s;on,
the mo&s;t con&s;iderable offices of the crown.</P>
<P>HOWEVER the ill humour of the commons might have
been increa&s;ed by the&s;e con&s;iderations, we are not to &s;up|po&s;e
them the &s;ole motives. The la&s;t parliament of James,
amid&s;t all their joy and fe&s;tivity, had given him a &s;upply
very di&s;proportioned to his demand and to the occa&s;ion.
And, as every hou&s;e of commons, which was elected during
forty years, &s;ucceeded to all the pa&s;&s;ions and principles of
their predece&s;&s;ors; we ought rather to account for this ob|&s;tinacy
from the general &s;ituation of the kingdom during
that whole period, than from any circum&s;tances which
attended this immediate conjuncture.</P>
<P>THE nation were very little accu&s;tomed at that time to
the burthen of taxes, and had never opened their pur&s;es
in any degree for the &s;upplying their &s;overeign. Even Eli|zabeth,
notwith&s;tanding her vigour and frugality, and the
nece&s;&s;ary wars in which &s;he was engaged, had great rea&s;on
to complain of the commons in this particular; nor could
the authority of that Prince&s;s, which was otherwi&s;e almo&s;t
ab&s;olute, ever extort from them the requi&s;ite &s;upplies of
money. Habits, more than rea&s;on, we find, in every thing,
to be the governing principle of mankind. In this view like|wi&s;e
the &s;inking of the value of &s;ub&s;idies mu&s;t be con&s;idered
as a lo&s;s to the King. The parliament, &s;wayed by cu&s;tom,
would not augment their number in the &s;ame proportion.</P>
<P>THE puritanical party, tho' di&s;gui&s;ed, had a very great
authority over the kingdom; and many of the leaders among
<PB N="141" REF="173">
the commons had &s;ecretly embraced the rigid tenets of that
&s;ect. All the&s;e were di&s;gu&s;ted with the court, both by
the prevalence of the principles of civil liberty, e&s;&s;ential to
their party, and on account of the re&s;traint under which
they were held by the e&s;tabli&s;hed hierarchy. In order to
fortify him&s;elf again&s;t the refentment of James, Buckingham
had affected popularity, and entered into the cabals of the
puritans: But, being &s;ecure of the confidence of Charles,
he had &s;ince abandoned that party; and, on that account,
was the more expo&s;ed to their hatred and re&s;entment. Tho'
the religious &s;chemes of many of the puritans, when ex|plained,
appear pretty frivolous, we are not thence to ima|gine,
that they were pur&s;ued by none but per&s;ons of weak
under&s;tanding. Some men of the greate&s;t parts and mo&s;t
exten&s;ive knowlege, whom the nation, at that time, pro|duced,
could not enjoy any peace of mind; becau&s;e obliged
to hear prayers offered up to the Divinity, by a prie&s;t, co|vered
with a white linen ve&s;tment.</P>
<P>THE match with France, and the articles in favour of catho|lics,
which were &s;u&s;pected to be in the treaty, were likewi&s;e
cau&s;es of di&s;gu&s;t to this whole party: Tho' it mu&s;t be re|marked,
that the alliance with that crown was infinitely le&s;s
obnoxious to the prote&s;tants, and le&s;s favourable to the catho|lics,
than that formerly projected with Spain, and was
therefore received rather with plea&s;ure than di&s;&s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>To all the&s;e cau&s;es we mu&s;t yet add another, of con&s;i|derable
moment. The hou&s;e of commons, we may ob&s;erve,
were almo&s;t intirely governed by a &s;et of men of the mo&s;t
uncommon capacity and the large&s;t views: Men, who were
now formed into a regular party, and united, as well by fix|ed
aims and projects, as by the hard&s;hips which &s;ome of
them had undergone in pro&s;ecution of them. Among the&s;e
we may mention the names of Sir Edward Coke, Sir Edwin
Sandys, Sir Robert Philips, Sir Francis Seymour, Sir Dud|ley Digges,
Sir John Elliot, Sir Thomas Wentworth, Mr.
<PB N="142" REF="174">
Selden, Mr. Pym. Animated with a warm regard to liberty,
the&s;e generous patriots &s;aw with regret an unbounded power
exerci&s;ed by the crown, and were re&s;olved to &s;eize the op|portunity,
which the King's nece&s;&s;ities offered them, of re|ducing
the prerogative within more rea&s;onable compa&s;s.
Tho' their ance&s;tors had blindly given way to practices and
precedents favourable to kingly power, and had been able,
notwith&s;tanding, to pre&s;erve &s;ome &s;mall remains of liberty;
it would be impo&s;&s;ible, they thought, when all the&s;e pre|ten&s;ions
were methodized and pro&s;ecuted by the increa&s;ing
knowlege of the age, to maintain any &s;hadow of popular
government, in oppo&s;ition to &s;uch unlimited authority in
the &s;overeign. It was nece&s;&s;ary to fix a choice: Either to
abandon intirely the privileges of the people, or to &s;ecure
them by firmer and more preci&s;e barriers than the con&s;titu|tion
had hitherto provided for them. In this dilemma, men
of &s;uch a&s;piring genius and &s;uch independent fortunes could
not long deliberate: They boldly embraced the &s;ide of
freedom, and re&s;olved to grant no &s;upplies to their nece&s;&s;i|tous
Prince, without extorting conce&s;&s;ions in favour of civil
liberty. The end, they e&s;teemed beneficent and noble:
The means, regular and con&s;titutional. To grant or refu&s;e
&s;upplies was the undoubted privilege of the commons. And
as all human governments, particularly tho&s;e of a mixed
frame, are in continual fluctuation; it was as natural, in
their opinion, and allowable, for popular a&s;&s;emblies to take
advantage of favourable incidents, in order to &s;ecure the
&s;ubjects; as for monarchs, in order to extend their own
authority. With plea&s;ure, they beheld the King involved
in a foreign war, which rendered him every day more de|pendent
on the parliament; while at the &s;ame time the &s;itua|tion
of the kingdom, even without any military prepara|tions,
gave it &s;ufficient &s;ecurity again&s;t all inva&s;ion from
foreigners. And perhaps, it had partly proceeded from ex|pectations
of this nature, that the popular leaders had been
&s;o urgent for a rupture with Spain; nor is it credible, that
<PB N="143" REF="175">
religious zeal could &s;o far have blinded all of them as to
make them di&s;cover, in &s;uch a mea&s;ure, any appearance of
nece&s;&s;ity, or any hopes of &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>BUT, however natural all the&s;e &s;entiments might appear
to the country-party, it is not to be imagined that Charles
would entertain the &s;ame ideas. Strongly prejudiced in
favour of the Duke, whom he had heard &s;o highly extolled
in parliament, he could not conjecture the cau&s;e of &s;o &s;ud|den
an alteration in their opinions. And when the war,
which they them&s;elves had &s;o earne&s;tly &s;olicited, was at la&s;t
commenced, the immediate de&s;ertion of their &s;overeign could
not but &s;eem very &s;trange and unaccountable. Even tho'
no farther motive had been &s;u&s;pected, the refu&s;al of &s;upply,
in &s;uch circum&s;tances, would naturally to him appear cruel
and deceitful: But when he perceived that this mea&s;ure
proceeded from an intention of encroaching on his authority,
he failed not to regard the&s;e aims as highly criminal and
traiterous. Tho&s;e lo&s;ty ideas of monarchical power, which
were very commonly adopted during that age, and to which
the ambiguous nature of the Engli&s;h con&s;titution gave &s;o
plau&s;ible an appearance, were firmly rivetted in Charles;
and however moderate his temper, the natural and unavoid|able
prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of &s;elf-love, joined to the late uniform
precedents in favour of prerogative, had made him conceive
his political tenets as certain and uncontroverted. Taught
to regard even the antient laws and con&s;titution more as
lines to direct his conduct than barriers to with&s;tand his
power; a con&s;piracy to erect new ramparts, in order to
&s;traiten his authority, appeared but one degree removed
from open &s;edition and rebellion. So atrocious in his eyes
was &s;uch a de&s;ign, that he &s;eems even unwilling to impute
it to the commons: And,<NOTE PLACE="marg">11th July.</NOTE> tho' he was obliged to adjourn
the parliament by rea&s;on of the plague, which at that time
raged in London;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1&s;t of Aug.</NOTE> he immediately re-a&s;&s;embled them at
<PB N="144" REF="176">
Oxford, and made a new attempt to gain from them &s;ome
&s;upplies in &s;uch an urgent nece&s;&s;ity.</P>
<P>CHARLES now found him&s;elf obliged to depart from
that delicacy which he had formerly maintained.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Parliament at Oxford.</NOTE> By him|&s;elf
or his mini&s;ters, he entered into a particular detail, both
of the alliances which he had formed, and of the military
operations which he had projected<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Dugdale, p. 25, 26.</NOTE> He told the parlia|ment,
That, by a promi&s;e of &s;ub&s;idies, he had engaged
the King of Denmark to take part in the war; that that
monarch intended to enter Germany by the north, and to
rouze to war tho&s;e princes, who impatiently longed for an
opportunity of a&s;&s;erting the liberty of the empire; that
Mansfeldt had undertaken to penetrate with an Engli&s;h army
into the Palatinate, and by that quarter to excite the mem|bers
of the evangelical union; that the &s;tates mu&s;t be &s;up|ported
in the unequal warfare which they maintained with
Spain; that no le&s;s a &s;um than 700,000 pounds a year had
been found, by computation, requi&s;ite for all the&s;e pur|po&s;es;
that the maintenance of the fleet and the defence of
Ireland demanded an annual expence of 400,000 pounds;
that he him&s;elf had already exhau&s;ted and anticipated, in
the public &s;ervice, his whole revenue, and had &s;carce left
&s;ufficient for the daily &s;ub&s;i&s;tence of him&s;elf and of his
family<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">parl. Hi&s;t. vol. vi. p. 396.</NOTE>; that, on his acce&s;&s;ion to the crown, he found a
debt of above 300,000 pounds, contracted by his father,
in &s;upport of the Palatine; and that, while Prince of
Wales, he had him&s;elf contracted debts, notwith&s;tanding
his great frugality, to the amount of 70,000 pounds, which
he had expended intirely on naval and military armaments.
After mentioning all the&s;e facts, the King even conde&s;cended
to u&s;e entreaties. He &s;aid, that this reque&s;t was the fir&s;t
which he had ever made them: that he was young and in the
commencement of his reign; and, if he now met with
<PB N="145" REF="177">
kind and dutiful u&s;age, it would endear to him the u&s;e of
parliaments, and would for ever pre&s;erve an intire harmony
between him and his people<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Ru&s;h. vol. i. p. 177, 178, &amp;c. Parl. Hi&s;t. vol. vi. p. 399. Frank|lyn, r. 108, 109. Journ. 10 Aug, 1625.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>To the&s;e rea&s;ons the commons remained inexorable. Not|with&s;tanding
that the King's mea&s;ures, on the &s;uppo&s;ition of
a foreign war, which they had con&s;tantly demanded, were al|together
unexceptionable, they ob&s;tinately refu&s;ed any far|ther
a&s;&s;i&s;tance. Some members, favourable to the court,
having in&s;i&s;ted on an addition of two fifteenths to the former
&s;upply, even this pittance was refu&s;ed<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Ru&s;h. vol. i. p. 190.</NOTE> tho' it was known,
that a fleet and army were lying at Port&s;mouth, in great
want of pay and provi&s;ions; and that Buckingham, the
admiral, and the trea&s;urer of the navy, had advanced on
their own credit near an hundred thou&s;and pounds for the
&s;ea-&s;ervice<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">parl. Hi&s;t. vol. vi. p. 390.</NOTE>. Be&s;ides all their other motives, the hou&s;e of
commons had made a new di&s;covery, which, as they wanted
but a pre$ence for their refu&s;al, inflamed them again&s;t the
court and again&s;t the Duke of Buckingham.</P>
<P>WHEN James de&s;erted the Spani&s;h alliance, and courted
that of France, he had promi&s;ed to furni&s;h Louis, who
was intirely de&s;titute of naval force, with one &s;hip of
war, and &s;even armed ve&s;&s;els, hired from the merchants.
The&s;e the French court had pretended they would em|ploy
again&s;t the Genoe&s;e, who, being firm and u&s;e|ful
allies to the Spani&s;h monarchy, were naturally re|garded
with an evil eye, both by the King of France and
of England. When the&s;e ve&s;&s;els, by Charles's orders, ar|rived
at Diepe, there aro&s;e a &s;trong &s;u&s;picion that they were
to &s;erve again&s;t Rochelle. The &s;ailors were enflamed. That
race of men, who are at pre&s;ent both carele&s; and ignorart
in all matters of religion, were at that time only ignorant.
They drew up a remon&s;trance to Pennington, their com|mander;
and, &s;igning all their names in a circle, left he
&s;hould di&s;cover the ring-leaders, they laid it under his
<PB N="146" REF="178">
prayer-book. Pennington declared, that he would rather
be hanged in England for di&s;obedience, than fight again&s;t
his brother-prote&s;tants in France. The whole &s;quadron
failed immediately to the Downs. There they received new
orders from Buckingham, lord admiral, to return to Diepe.
As the Duke knew that authority alone would not &s;uffice,
he employed much art and many &s;ubtilities to engage them
to obedience; and a rumour, which was &s;pread, that peace
had been concluded between the French King and the hu|gonots,
a&s;&s;i&s;ted him in his purpo&s;e. When they arrived at
Diepe, they found that they had been deceived. Sir Ferdi|nando
Gorges, who commanded one of the ve&s;&s;els, broke
thro' and returned to England. All the officers and &s;ailors
of all the other &s;hips, notwith&s;tanding great offers made
them by the French, immediately de&s;erted. One gunner
alone preferred duty towards his King to the cau&s;e of reli|gion;
and he was afterwards killed in charging a cannon before Rochelle<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Franklyn, p. 109. Ru&s;h. vol. i. p. 175, 176, &amp;c. 325, 326, &amp;c.</NOTE> The care which hi&s;torians have taken
to record this frivolous event, &s;hows with what plea&s;ure the
news was received by the whole nation.</P>
<P>THE hou&s;e of commons, when informed of the&s;e tran&s;|actions,
&s;howed the &s;ame attachment with the &s;ailors for the
prote&s;tant religion; nor was their zeal much better guided
by rea&s;on and found policy. It was not con&s;idered, that,
if the force of Spain was really &s;o exorbitant as they ima|gined,
the French monarch was the only prince who could
oppo&s;e its progre&s;s, and pre&s;erve the balance of Europe;
that his power was at pre&s;ent fettered by the hugonots,
who, being po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of many privileges and even of forti|fied
towns, formed an empire within his empire, and kept
him in perpetual jealou&s;y and inquietude; that an in&s;urrec|tion
had been at that time wantonly and voluntarily formed
by their leaders, who, being di&s;gu&s;ted in &s;ome court-intrigue,
took advantage of the never-failing pretence of religion, in
<PB N="147" REF="179">
order to cover their rebellion; that the Dutch, influenced
by the&s;e views, had ordered a &s;quadron of twenty &s;hips to
join the French fleet, employed again&s;t the inhabitants of
Rochelle<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Journ. 18 April 1626.</NOTE> that the Spani&s;h monarch, &s;en&s;ible of the &s;ame
con&s;equences, &s;ecretly &s;upported the prote&s;tants in France;
and that all princes had ever &s;acrificed to rea&s;ons of &s;tate the
intere&s;t of their religion in foreign countries. All the&s;e ob|vious
con&s;iderations had no influence. Great murmurs and
di&s;contents &s;till prevailed in parliament. The hugonots,
tho' they had no ground of complaint again&s;t the French
court, were thought to be as much intitled to a&s;&s;i&s;tance
from England, as if they had taken arms in defence of their
liberties and religion again&s;t the per&s;ecuting rage of the ca|tholics.
And i$ plainly appears from this incident, as well
as from many others, that, of all European nations, the
Briti&s;h were at that time, and till long after, the mo&s;t under
the influence of that religious &s;pirit, which tends rather to
inflame bigotry than increa&s;e peace and mutual charity.</P>
<P>ON this occa&s;ion, the commons renewed their eternal
complaints again&s;t the growth of popery, which was ever
the chief of their grievances, and now their only one<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Franklyn, p. 3, &amp;c.</NOTE>
They demanded a &s;trict execution of the penal laws again&s;t
the catholics, and remon&s;trated again&s;t &s;ome late pardons
which had been granted to prie&s;ts<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Parl, Hi&s;t. vol. vi. p. 374. Journ. 1 Aug. 1625.</NOTE>. They attacked Mon|tague,
one of the King's chaplains, on account of a mode|rate
book which he had lately compo&s;ed, and which, to
their great di&s;gu&s;t, &s;aved virtuous catholics, as well as other
chri&s;tians, from eternal torments<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Parl. Hi&s;t. vol. vi. p. 353. Journ. 7 July 1625.</NOTE>. Charles gave them a
gracious and a compliant an&s;wer to all their remon&s;trances.
He was, however, in his heart, extremely aver&s;e to the&s;e
furious mea&s;ures. Tho' a determined prote&s;tant, by prin|ciple
as well as inclination, he had entertained no violent
<PB N="148" REF="180">
horror again&s;t popery; and a little humanity, he thought,
was due by the nation to the religion of their ance&s;tors.
That degree of liberty, which is now indulged to catholics,
tho' $ party much more obnoxious than during the reign of
the Stuarts, it &s;uited neither with Charles's &s;entiments, nor
the humour of the age, to allow them. An abatement of
the more rigorous laws was all he intended; and his engage|ments
with France, notwith&s;tanding that their regular exe|cution
had never been propo&s;ed nor expected, required of
him &s;ome indulgence. But &s;o unfortunate was this Prince,
that no mea&s;ure, embraced during his whole reign, was ever
attended with more unhappy and more fatal con&s;equences.</P>
<P>THE extreme rage again&s;t popery was a &s;ure characteri&s;tic
of puritani&s;m. This hou&s;e of commons di&s;covered other
infallible &s;ymptoms of the prevalence of that party. They
petitioned the King for replacing &s;uch able clergy as had
been &s;ilenced for want of conformity to the ceremonies<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Ru&s;h. vol. i. p. 281</NOTE>.
They al&s;o enacted laws for the &s;trict ob&s;ervance of Sunday,
which the puritans affected to call the Sabbath, and which
they &s;anctified by the mo&s;t melancholy indolence<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">1 Car. I. cap. 1. Journ. 21 June 1625.</NOTE> 'Tis
to be remarked, that the different appellations of this fe&s;ti|val
were at that time known &s;ymbols of the different par|ties.</P>
<P>THE King, finding that the parliament were re&s;olved to
grant him no &s;upply, and would furni&s;h him with nothing
but empty prote&s;tations of duty<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Franklyn, p. 113. Ru&s;hworth, vol. i. p. 190.</NOTE> or di&s;agreeable com|plaints

10,000 men. Sir Edward Cecil, lately created Vi&s;count
Wimbleton, was entru&s;ted with the command. He &s;ailed
immediately for Cadiz, and found the bay full of Spani&s;h &s;hips
of great value. He either neglected to attack the&s;e &s;hips,
or attempted it prepo&s;terou&s;ly. The army was landed, and
a fort taken: But the undi&s;ciplined &s;oldiers, finding &s;tore
of wine, could not be re&s;trained from the utmo&s;t exce&s;&s;es.
Farther &s;tay appearing fruitle&s;s, they were re-imbarked;
and the fleet put to &s;ea with an intention of waiting for the

and &s;oldiers, they were obliged to abandon all hopes of this
prize, and return to England. Loud complaints were made
again&s;t the court for entru&s;ting &s;o important a command to
a man like Cecil, whom, tho' he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed-great experience,

<P>CHARLES,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1626.</NOTE> having failed of &s;o rich a prize, was obliged

every day more plainly the imprudence of the Spani&s;h war;
tho' the increa&s;e of his nece&s;&s;ities, rendered him more de|pendent,
and more expo&s;ed to the encroachments of the
commons; he was re&s;olved to try once more that regular
and con&s;titutional expedient for &s;upply. Perhaps too, a
little political art, which at that time he practi&s;ed, was
<PB N="150" REF="182">
much tru&s;ted to. He had named four popular leaders &s;he|riffs
of counties; Sir Edward Coke, Sir Robert Philips,
Sir Thomas Wentworth, Sir Francis Seymour; and tho'
this que&s;tion had been formerly much conte&s;ted<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">It is always an expre&s;s clau&s;e in the writ of &s;ummons, that no &s;heriff &s;hall be cho&s;en; but the contrary practice had often prevailed. D'Ewes, p. 38. Yet &s;till great doubts were entertained on this head. See Journ. 9 April 1614.</NOTE> he thought
that he had by that means incapacitated them for being
elected members. But this intention, being &s;o evident, ra|ther
put the commons more upon their guard. Enow of pa|triots
&s;till remained to keep up the ill humour of the hou&s;e;
and men needed but little in&s;truction or rhetoric to recom|mend
to them practices which increa&s;ed their own import|ance
and con&s;ideration. The weakne&s;s of the court al&s;o
could not more evidently appear, than by its being reduced
to &s;o ineffectual an expedient, in order to obtain an influence
over the commons.</P>
<P>THE views,<NOTE PLACE="marg">February 6.</NOTE> therefore, of the la&s;t parliament were im|mediately
adopted; as if the &s;ame men had been every|where
elected, and no time had intervened &s;ince their la&s;t
meeting. When the King laid before the hou&s;e his nece&s;&s;|ties,
and a&s;ked for &s;upply, they immediately voted him three
&s;ub&s;idies and three fifteenths; and tho' they afterwards added
one &s;ub&s;idy more, the &s;um was little proportioned to the
greatne&s;s of the occa&s;ion, and ill fitted to promote tho&s;e views
of &s;ucce&s;s and glory, for which the young Prince, in hi$
fir&s;t enterprize, &s;o ardently longed. But this circum&s;tance
was not the mo&s;t di&s;agreeable one. The &s;upply was only
voted by the commons. The pa&s;&s;ing that vote into a law
was re&s;erved till the end of the &s;e&s;&s;ion<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Journ, 27 Mar. 1626.</NOTE>. A condition was
thereby made, in a very undi&s;gui&s;ed manner, with their &s;o|vereign.
Under colour of redre&s;&s;ing grievances, which,
during this &s;hort reign, could not be very numerous; they
were to proceed in regulating and controuling every part of
government which di&s;plea&s;ed them: And if the King either
<PB N="151" REF="183">
cut them &s;hort in this undertaking, or refu&s;ed compliance
with their demands, he mu&s;t lay his account with the want
of all &s;upply. Great di&s;&s;atisfaction was expre&s;&s;ed by Charles
with a method of treatment which he deemed &s;o har&s;h and
undutiful<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Parliamentary Hi&s;tory, vol. vi. p. 449. Ru&s;hworth, vol. i. p. 224.</NOTE>. But his urgent nece&s;&s;ities obliged him to &s;ub|mit;
and he waited with patience, ob&s;erving to what &s;ide
they would turn them&s;elves.</P>
<P>THE Duke of Buckingham,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Impeach|ment of Bucking|ham.</NOTE> formerly obnoxious to the
public, became every day more odious, by the &s;ymptoms
which appeared both of his want of temper and prudence,
and of the uncontrouled a&s;cendant which he had acquired
over his matter<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">His credit with the King had given him &s;uch influence, that he had no le&s;s than twenty proxies granted him this parliament by &s;o many peers; which occasioned a vote, that no peer &s;hould have above two proxies. The earl of Leice&s;ter in 1585 had once ten proxies. D'Ewes, p. 314.</NOTE>. Two violent attacks he was obliged
this &s;e&s;&s;ion to &s;u&s;tain; one from the Earl of Bri&s;tol, another
from the hou&s;e of commons.</P>
<P>As long as James lived, Bri&s;tol, &s;ecure of the concealed
favour of that monarch, had expre&s;&s;ed all duty and obe|dience;
in expectation that an opportunity would offer of
re-in&s;tating him&s;elf in his former credit and authority.
Even after Charles's acce&s;&s;ion, he de&s;paired not. He &s;ub|mitted
to the King's order of remaining in his country-feat,
and of ab&s;enting him&s;elf from parliament. Many trials he
made to regain the good opinion of his ma&s;ter; but finding
them all fruitle&s;s and ob&s;erving Charles to be intirely go|verned
by Buckingham, his implacable enemy, he re&s;olved
no longer to keep any measure&s; with the court. A new
&s;pirit, he &s;aw, and a new power, ari&s;ing in the nation; and
to the&s;e he was re&s;olved for the future to tru&s;t for his &s;ecu|rity

<P>WHEN the parliament was &s;ummoned, Charles, by a
&s;tretch of prerogative, had given orders that no writ, as is

cu&s;tomary, &s;hould be &s;ent of Bri&s;tol<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Ru&s;hworth, vol. i. p. 236.</NOTE>. That nobleman ap|plied
to the hou&s;e of lords by petition; and crayed their
good offices with the King for obtaining what was his due
as a peer of the realm. His writ was &s;ent him; but accom|panied
with a letter from the lord keeper, Coventry, com|manding
him, in the King's name, to ab&s;ent him&s;elf from
parliament. This letter Bri&s;tol conveyed to the lords, and
a&s;ked advice how to proceed in &s;o delicate a &s;ituation<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Ru&s;hworth, vol. i. p. 237. Franklyn, p. 120, &amp;c.</NOTE>.
The King'&s; prohibition wa&s; withdrawn, and Bri&s;tol took
hi&s; feat. Provoked at the&s;e repeated in&s;tances of vigour,
which the court denominated contumacy, Charle&s; ordered
his attorney-general to enter an accu&s;ation of high trea&s;on
again&s;t him. By way of recrimination, Bri&s;tol impeached
Buckingham of high trea&s;on. The Earl's defence of him|&s;elf
and accu&s;ation of the Duke both remain<NOTE N="w" PLACE="foot">Ru&s;hworth, vol. i. p. 256, 262, 263, &amp;c Frank|lyn, p. 123, &amp;c.</NOTE>; and toge|ther
with &s;ome original letter&s; &s;till exant, contain the fulle&s;t
and mo&s;t authentic account of all the negotiations with the
hou&s;e of Au&s;tria. From the whole, the great imprudence
of the Duke evidently appears, and the &s;way of his ungo|vernable
pa&s;&s;ions; but it would be difficult to collect thence any action which in the eye of the law could be deemed a
crime; much le&s;s could &s;ubject him to the penalty of high
trea&s;on.</P>
<P>THE impeachment of the commons was &s;till le&s;s dangerous
to the Duke, were it e&s;timated by the &s;tandard of law and
equity. The hou&s;e, after having voted, upon &s;ome que|ries
of Dr. Turner's, <HI>that common fame was a &s;ufficient
ground of accu&s;ation by the commons</HI><NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Ru&s;h, vol. i. p. 217, Whitlocke, p. 5.</NOTE>, proceeded to frame
regular articles again&s;t Buckingham. They accu&s;ed him,
of having united many offices in his per&s;on; of having
bought two of them; of neglecting to guard the &s;ea&s;, in|fomuch
that many merchant-&s;hips had fallen into the hands
of the enemy; of delivering &s;hips to the French King, in
<PB N="153" REF="187">
order to &s;erve again&s;t the hugonots; of being employed in
the &s;ale of honours and offices; of accepting exten&s;ive
grants from the crown; of procuring many titles of honour
for his kindred; of admini&s;tring phy&s;ic to the late King
without acquainting his phy&s;icians. All the&s;e articles ap|pear,
from comparing the accu&s;ation and reply, to be either
frivolous or fal&s;e, or both<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Ru&s;hworth vol. i. p. 306, &amp;c. 375, &amp;c. Journ. 25 March 1626.</NOTE>. The only charge, which could
be regarded as important, was, that he had extorted a &s;um
of ten thou&s;and pounds from the Ea&s;t-India company, and
that he had confi&s;cated &s;ome goods belonging to French
merchants, on pretence of their being the property of Spa|ni&s;h.
The impeachment never came to a full determina|tion;
&s;o that it is difficult for us to give a deci&s;ive opinion
with regard to the&s;e articles: But it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, that
the Duke's; an&s;wer in the&s;e particulars, as in all the re&s;t, is
&s;o clear and &s;atisfactory, that it is impo&s;&s;ible to refu&s;e our
a&s;&s;ent to it<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Whitlocke, p. 7.</NOTE>. His faults and blemi&s;hes were in many re|&s;pect
very great; but rapacity and avarice were vice with
which he was intirely unacquainted.</P>
<P>'TIS remarkable that the commons, tho' &s;o much at a
lo&s;s to find articles of charge again&s;t Buckingham, never
adopted Bri&s;tol's accu&s;ation, or impeached the Duke for his
conduct in the Spani&s;h treaty, the mo&s;t blameable circum|&s;tance
of his whole life. He had rea&s;on to believe the Spa|niard&s;
&s;incere in their profe&s;&s;ion&s; yet, in order to gratify
his private pa&s;&s;ions, he had hurried his ma&s;ter and his coun|try
into a war pernicious to the intere&s;ts of both. But &s;o
riveted throughout the nation were the prejudices with re|gard
to Spani&s;h deceit and fal&s;hood, that very few of the
commons &s;eem as yet to have been convinced that they had
been &s;educed by Buckingham's narrative: A certain proof
that a di&s;covery of this nature was not, as is imagined by
<PB N="154" REF="188">
&s;everal historians, the cau&s;e of &s;o &s;udden and &s;urpri&s;ing a
variation in the mea&s;ures of the parliament<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">By a &s;peech of Sir Simon D'Ewes, in the fir&s;t year of the long parlia|ment, it clearly appears, that the nation never had, even to that time, been rightly in&s;tructed in the tran&s;actions of the Spanish negotiation, and &s;till believed the court of Madrid to have been altogether in&s;incere in all their pro|fe&s;&s;ions. What rea&s;on, upon that &s;uppo&s;ition, had they to blance either the Prince or Buckingham for their conduct, or for the narrative delivered to the parliament? This is a capital fact, and ought to be well attended to. D'Ewes's &s;peech is in Nal&s;on, vol. ii. p. 368. No author or hi&s;torian of that age mentions the di&s;covery of Buckingham's impo&s;ture&s; as a cau&s;e of di&s;gu&s;t in the parliament. Whitlocke, p. 1. only &s;ays, that the commons began to &s;u&s;pect, <HI>that it had been &s;pleen in Buckingham,</HI> not zeal for public good, <HI>which bad induced him to break the Spani&s;h match:</HI> A clear proof that his fal&s;hood was not &s;u&s;pected. Wil&s;on, p. 780, &s;ays, that Buckingham lo&s;t his popularity after Bri&s;tol arrived, not becau&s;e that nobleman discovered the falf|hood of his narrative, but becau&s;e he proved that Buckingham, while in Spain, had pro&s;e&s;&s;ed him&s;elf a papi&s;t; which is fal&s;e, and which was never &s;aid by Bri&s;tol. In all the debate&s; which remain, not the lea&s;t hint is ever given, that any fal&s;hood was &s;u&s;pected in the narrative. I &s;hall farther add, that even if the parliament had discovered the deceit in Buckingham's narra|tive, this ought not to have altered their political mea&s;ures, or made them re|fu&s;e &s;upply to the King. They had &s;uppo&s;ed it practicable to wre&s;t the Pala|tinate from the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria; they had repre&s;ented it as prudent to ex|pend the blood and trea&s;ure of the nation on &s;uch an enterprize; they had believed that the King of Spain never had any &s;incere intention of reftoring that principality. 'Tis certain that he had not now any &s;uch intention: And tho' there was rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect, that this alteration of his views had proceed|ed from the ill conduct of Buckingham, yet pa&s;t errors could not be retrieved; and the nation was undoubtedly in the &s;ame &s;ituation, which the parliament had ever &s;uppo&s;ed, when they &s;o much haras&s;ed their &s;overeign, by their impatient, importunate, and even undutiful &s;olicitations. To which we may add, that Charles him&s;elf was certainly deceived by Buckingham, when he corroborated his favourite's narrative by his te&s;timony. Party historians are &s;omewhat incon&s;istent in their repre&s;entations of the&s;e tran&s;actions: They repre&s;ent the Spaniards as totally in&s;incere, that they may reproach James with credulity in being &s;o long deceived by them: They repre&s;ent them as &s;incere, that they may reproach the King, the Prince, and the Duk, with fal&s;hood in their narrative to the parliament. The truth is, they were in|&s;incere at fir&s;t; but the reason&s;, proceeding from bigotry, were not &s;u&s;pe&amp;cted by James, and were at la&s;t overcome. They became &s;incere; but the Prince, deceived by the many unavoidable cau&s;es of delay, believed that they were &s;till deceiving him.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="155" REF="189">
WHILE the commons were thus warmly engaged again&s;t
Buckingham, the King &s;eemed de&s;irous of embracing every
opportunity by which he could expre&s;s a contempt and
di&s;regard for them. No one was at that time &s;ufficiently
&s;en&s;ible of the great weight which the commons bore in
the balance of the con&s;titution. The hi&s;tory of England
had never hitherto afforded an in&s;tance, where any great
movement or revolution had proceeded from the lower
hou&s;e. And as their rank, both con&s;idered in a body and
as individuals, was but the &s;econd in the kingdom; nothing
le&s;s than fatal experience could engage the Engli&s;h princes to
pay a due regard to the inclinations of that formidable a&s;|&s;embly.</P>
<P>THE Earl of Suffolk, chancellor of the univer&s;ity of
Cambridge, dying about this time, Buckingham, tho' lying
under impeachment, was yet, by means of court-intere&s;t,
cho&s;en in his place. The commons re&s;ented and loudly
complained of thi&s; affront; and the more to enrage them,
the King him&s;elf wrote a letter to the univer&s;ity, extolling
the Duke, and giving them thanks for his election<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Ru&s;hworth, vol. i. p. 371.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE lord keeper, in the King's name, commanded the
hou&s;e expre&s;ly not to meddle with his mini&s;ter and &s;ervant,
Buckingham; and ordered them to fini&s;h in a few days the
bill which they had begun for the &s;ub&s;idies, and to make
&s;ome addition to them; otherwi&s;e they mu&s;t expect to &s;it no
longer<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Parl. Hi&s;t. vol. vi. p. 444.</NOTE>. And tho' the&s;e har&s;h command&s; were endeavoured
to be explained and $ollified, a few days afterwards, by a
&s;peech of Buckingham<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Parliam. Hi&s;t. vol. vi. p. 451. Ru&s;hworth, vol. i. p. 225. Franklyn, p. 118.</NOTE>, they failed not to leave a very
di&s;agreeable impre&s;&s;ion behind them.</P>
<P>BESIDES a more &s;tately &s;tyle which Charles in general
affected to this parliament than to the la&s;t, he went &s;o far, in
a me&s;&s;age, as to threaten the commons, that if they did not
<PB N="156" REF="190">
furni&s;h him with &s;upplies, he would be obliged to try <HI>new
councils.</HI> This language was &s;ufficiently clear: Yet, le&s;t
any ambiguity &s;hould remain, Sir Dudley Carleton, vice|chamberlain,
took care to explain it.
&startq;I pray you con|&s;ider,&endq;
&s;aid he, &startq;what the&s;e new councils are or may
be. I fear to declare tho&s;e that I conceive. In all chri&s;|tian
kingdoms, you know that parliaments were in u&s;e
antiently, by which tho&s;e kingdoms were governed in a
mo&s;t flouri&s;hing manner; until the monarchs began to
know their own &s;trength, and, &s;eeing the turbulent &s;pirit
of their parliaments, at length they, by little and little,
began to &s;tand on their prerogatives, and at la&s;t over|threw
the parliaments, throughout Chri&s;tendom, except
here only with us.&mdash;Let us be careful then to pre|&s;erve
the King's good opinion of parliaments, which
bringeth &s;uch happine&s;s to this nation, and makes us en|vied
of all others, while there is this &s;weetne&s;s between
his Maje&s;ty and the commons; le&s;t we lo&s;e the repute of
a free people by our turbulency in parliament<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Ru&s;hworth, vol. i. p. 359. Whitlocke, p. 6.</NOTE>.&endq; The&s;e
imprudent &s;ugge&s;tions rather gave warning than &s;truck ter|ror.
A precarious liberty, the commons thought, which
was to be pre&s;erved by unlimited complai&s;ance, was no liberty
at all. And it was nece&s;&s;ary, while yet in their power, to
&s;ecure the con&s;titution by &s;uch invincible barriers, that no
king or mini&s;ter &s;hould ever for the future, dare to &s;peak
&s;uch a language to any parliament, or even to entertain &s;uch
a project again&s;t them.</P>
<P>Two members of the hou&s;e, Sir Dudley Digges and Sir
John Elliott, who had been employed as managers of the
impeachment again&s;t the Duke, were thrown into pri&s;on<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Ru&s;hworth, vol. i. p. 356.</NOTE>.
The commons immediately declared, that they would pro|ceed
no farther upon bu&s;ine&s;s till they had &s;atisfaction in
their privileges. Charles alleged, as the rea&s;on of this vio|lent
mea&s;ure, certain &s;editious expre&s;&s;ions, which, he &s;aid,
<PB N="157" REF="191">
had, in their accu&s;ation of the Duke, dropped from the&s;e
members. Upon inquiry, it appeared, that no &s;uch ex|pre&s;&s;ions
had been u&s;ed<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Ru&s;hworth, vol. i. p. 358, 361. Franklyn, p. 180.</NOTE>. The members were relea&s;ed;
and the King reaped no farther benefit from this attempt,
tham to exa&s;perate the hou&s;e &s;till farther, and to &s;how &s;ome
degree of precipitancy and indi&s;cretion.</P>
<P>MOVED by this example, the hou&s;e of peers were rou&s;ed
from their inactivity; and claimed liberty for the Earl of
Arundel, who had been lately confined in the Tower.
After many fruitle&s;s eva&s;ions, the King, tho' &s;omewhat
ungracefully, was at la&s;t obliged to comply<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Ru&s;h. vol. i. p. 363, 364, &amp;c. Franklyn, p. 181.</NOTE>. And in this
incident, it &s;ufficiently appeared, that the lords, however
little inclined to popular cour&s;es, were not wanting in a ju&s;t
&s;en&s;e of their own dignity.</P>
<P>THE ill humour of the commons, thus wantonly irritated
by the court, and finding no gratification in the legal im|peachment
of Buckingham, &s;ought other materials on which
it might exert it&s;elf. The never-failing cry of popery here
&s;erved them in &s;tead. They again claimed the execution of
the penal laws again&s;t catholics; and they pre&s;ented to the
King a li&s;t of per&s;ons, entru&s;ted with offices, mo&s;t of them
in&s;ignificant, who were either convicted or &s;u&s;pected recu|&s;ants<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Franklyn, p. 195. Ru&s;hworth.</NOTE>.
In this particular, they had, perhaps, &s;ome rea&s;on
to blame the King's conduct. He had promi&s;ed to the la&s;t
hou&s;e of commons a redre&s;s of this religious grievance:
But he was apt, in imitation of his father, to imagine, that
the parliament, when they failed of &s;upplying his nece&s;&s;i|ties,
had, on their part, freed him from the obligation of a
&s;trict performance. A new odium, likewi&s;e, by the&s;e re|pre&s;entations,
was attempted to be thrown upon Bucking|ham.
His mother, who had great influence over him, was
a profe&s;&s;ed catholic; his wife was not free from &s;u&s;picion:

And the indulgence given to catholics was of cour&s;e &s;up|po&s;ed
to proceed intirely from his credit and authority. So
violent was the bigotry of the times, that it was thought a
&s;ufficient rea&s;on for di&s;qualifying any one from holding an
office, that his wife or relations, or companions, were pa|pi&s;ts,
tho' he him&s;elf were a conformi&s;t<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">See the li&s;t in Franklyn and Ru&s;hworth.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>'Tis remarkable, that per&s;ecution was here chiefly pu&s;hed
on by laymen; and that the church was willing to have
granted more liberty than would be allowed by the commons.
The reconciling doctrines likewi&s;e of Montague failed not
anew to meet with &s;evere cen&s;ures from that zealous a&s;|&s;embly<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Ru&s;h. vol. i. p. 209.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE next attack made by the commons, had it pre|vailed,
would have proved deci&s;ive. They were preparing
a remon&s;trance again&s;t the levying of tonnage and poundage
without con&s;ent of parliament. This article, together with
the new impo&s;itions laid on merchandize by James, con&s;ti|tuted
near a half of the crown-revenues; and by depriving
the King of the&s;e re&s;ources, they would have reduced him
to total &s;ubjection and dependence. While they retained
&s;uch a pledge, be&s;ides the &s;upply already promi&s;ed, they were
&s;ure that nothing could be refu&s;ed them. Tho', after can|va&s;&s;ing
the matter near three months, they found them&s;elves
utterly incapable of fixing any legal crime upon the Duke,
they ju&s;tly regarded him as a very unable and even dan|gerous
mini&s;ter; and they intended to pre&s;ent a petition,
which would then have been equivalent to a command,
for removing him from his Maje&s;ty's per&s;on and councils<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Idem ibid. p. 400. Franklyn, p. 199.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE King was alarmed at the yoke which he &s;aw pre|pared
for him. Buckingham's great guilt, he thought, was
the being his friend and favourite<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Franklyn, p. 178.</NOTE>. All the other com|plaints
again&s;t him were mere pretences. A little before,
<PB N="159" REF="195">
he was the idol of the people. No new crime had &s;ince been
di&s;covered. After the mo&s;t diligent inquiry, prompted by
the greate&s;t malice, the &s;malle&s;t appearance of guilt could
not be fixed upon him. What idea, he a&s;ked, mu&s;t all
mankind entertain of his honour, &s;hould he &s;acrifice his in|nocent
friend to pecuniary con&s;iderations? What farther
authority would he retain in the nation, were he capable, in
the beginning of his reign, to give, in &s;o &s;ignal an in&s;tance,
&s;uch matter of triumph to his enemies, and di&s;couragement
to his adherents? To-day, the commons pretended to wre&s;t
his mini&s;ter from him. To-morrow, they would attack
&s;ome branch of his prerogative. By their remon&s;trances,
and promi&s;es and prote&s;tations, they had engaged the crown
in a war. So &s;oon as they &s;aw a retreat impo&s;&s;ible, without
waiting for new incidents, without covering them&s;elves with
new pretences, they immediately de&s;erted him, and refu&s;ed
him all rea&s;onable &s;upply. It was evident, that they de&s;ired
nothing &s;o much as to &s;ee him plunged in inextricable diffi|culties,
of which they intended to take advantage. To &s;uch
deep perfidy, to &s;uch unbounded u&s;urpations, it was nece&s;|&s;ary
to oppo&s;e a proper firmne&s;s and re&s;olution. And any
extremity was preferable to the contempt of &s;ubjects, to
the in&s;ults of mean adver&s;aries.</P>
<P>PROMPTED by the&s;e motives, Charles was determined
immediately to di&s;&s;olve the parliament. When this re&s;olu|tion
was known, the hou&s;e of peers, who&s;e compliant be|haviour
intitled them to &s;ome authority with him, endea|voured
to interpo&s;e<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Ru&s;hworth, vol. i. p. 398.</NOTE>; and they petitioned him, that he
would allow the parliament to &s;it &s;ome time longer. <HI>Not a
moment longer,</HI> cried the King ha&s;tily<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Sander&s;on, Life of Charles I. p. 58.</NOTE>; and he &s;oon after
ended this &s;e&s;&s;ion by a di&s;&s;olution.</P>
<P>As this mea&s;ure was fore&s;een, the commons took care to
fini&s;h and di&s;per&s;e their remon&s;trance, which they intended
<PB N="160" REF="196">
as a ju&s;tification of their conduct to the people.<NOTE PLACE="marg">$5th June.</NOTE> The King
likewi&s;e, on his part, publi&s;hed a declaration, where he
gave the rea&s;ons of his di&s;agreement with the parliament,
and of their &s;udden di&s;&s;olution, before they had time to
conclude any one act<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Franklyn, p. 203, &amp;c. Parl. Hi&s;t. vol. vii. p. 300.</NOTE>. The&s;e papers furni&s;hed the parti|zans
on both &s;ides with ample matter of apology or of re|crimination.
But all impartial men judged, &startq;<HI>That</HI> the
commons, tho' they had not violated any law, yet, by
their unpliablene&s;s and independence, were in&s;en&s;ibly
changing, perhaps improving, the &s;pirit and genius,
while they pre&s;erved the forms, of the con&s;titution:
And <HI>that</HI> the King was acting altogether without any
plan; running on in a road &s;urrounded on all &s;ides with
the mo&s;t dangerous precipices, and concerting no proper
mea&s;ures, either for &s;ubmitting to the ob&s;tinacy of the
commons, or for &s;ubduing it.&endq;</P>
<P>AFTER a breach with the parliament, which &s;eemed &s;o
difficult to repair, the only rational coun&s;el, which Charles
could pur&s;ue, was immediately to conclude a peace with
Spain, and to render him&s;elf, as far as po&s;&s;ible, independent
of his people, who di&s;covered &s;o little inclination to &s;upport
him, or rather who &s;eem to have formed a determined re&s;o|lution
to abridge his authority. Nothing could be more
ea&s;y in the execution than this mea&s;ure, nor more agreeable
to his own and to national intere&s;t. But, be&s;ides the trea|ties
and engagements which he had entered into with Hol|land
and with Denmark, the King's thoughts were at this
time intirely aver&s;e to pacific coun&s;els. There are two cir|cum&s;tances
in Charles's character, &s;eemingly incompatible,
which attended him during the whole cour&s;e of his reign,
and were in part the cau&s;e of all his misfortunes: He was
very &s;teddy and even ob&s;tinate in his purpo&s;e; and he was
ea&s;ily governed, by rea&s;on of his facility, and of his defer|ence
to men much inferior to him&s;elf both in morals and
<PB N="161" REF="197">
under&s;tanding. His great ends he inflexibly maintained:
But the means of attaining them, he readily received from
his mini&s;ters and favourites; tho' not always fortunate in
his choice. The violent, impetuous Buckingham, inflamed
with a de&s;ire of revenge for injuries which he him&s;elf had
committed, and animated with a love for glory which he
had not talents to merit, had at this time, notwith&s;tanding
his profu&s;e licentious life, acquired an invincible a&s;cendant
over the virtuous and gentle temper of the King.</P>
<P>THE <HI>new Councils,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Violent mea&s;ures of the court.</NOTE> which Charles had mentioned to the
parliament, were now to be tried, in order to &s;upply his ne|ce&s;&s;ities.
Had he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed any military force, on which he
could depend, 'tis not improbable that he had at once taken off
the ma&s;k, and governed without any regard to parliamentary pri|vileges:
So high an idea had he received of kingly preroga|tive,
and &s;o contemptible a notion of the rights of tho&s;e popu|lar
a&s;&s;emblies, from which, he very naturally thought he had
met with &s;uch ill u&s;age. But his army was new levied, ill paid,
and wor&s;e di&s;ciplined; no-wi&s;e &s;perior to the militia, who
were much more numerous, and who were in a great mea&s;ure
under the influence of the country gentlemen. It behoved him,
therefore, to proceed caution&s;ly, and to cover his enterprizes
under the pretence of antient precedents, which, con&s;idering
the great authority commonly enjoyed by his predece&s;&s;ors,
could not be wanting to him.</P>
<P>A COMMISSION was openly granted to compound with
the catholics, and agree for a di&s;pen&s;ation with the penal
laws enacted again&s;t them<NOTE N="P" PLACE="foot">Ru&s;hworth, vol. i. p. 413. Whitlocke, P. 7.</NOTE>. By this expedient, the king
both filled his coffers, and gratified his inclination of giving
indulgence to the&s;e religioni&s;ts: But he could not readily
have employed any branch of prerogative, which would
have been more di&s;agreeable, or would have appeared more
exceptionable to his prote&s;tant &s;ubjects.</P>
<P><PB N="162" REF="198">
FROM the nobility, he de&s;ired a&s;&s;i&s;tance: From the city,
he required a loan of 100,000 pounds. The former con|tributed
&s;lowly: But the latter, covering them&s;elves under
many pretences and excu&s;es, gave him at la&s;t a flat denial<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Ru&s;hworth, vol. i. p. 415. Franklyn, p. 206.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IN order to equip a fleet, a di&s;tribution, by order of the
council, was made to all the maritime towns; and each of
them was required, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the adjacent coun|ties,
to arm &s;o many ve&s;&s;els as were appointed them<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Ru&s;h. ut &s;upra.</NOTE> The
city of London was rated at twenty &s;hips. This is the fir&s;t
appearance, in Charles's reign, of &s;hip-money; a taxation
which had once been impo&s;ed by Elizabeth, but which af|terwards,
when carried &s;ome &s;teps farther, by Charles, cre|ated
&s;uch violent di&s;contents.</P>
<P>OF &s;ome, loans were required<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Ra&s;hworth, vol. i. p. 416.</NOTE>: To others, the way of
benevolence was propo&s;ed: Methods &s;upported by prece|dents,
but always invidious even in times more &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive
and compliant. In the mo&s;t ab&s;olute governments, &s;uch
expedients would be regarded as irregular and di&s;orderly.</P>
<P>THESE councils for &s;upply were conducted with &s;ome
moderation;<NOTE PLACE="marg">25th Aug.</NOTE> till news arrived, that a great battle was fought between the King of Denmark and Count Tilly, the impe|rial general; in which the former was totally defeated. Mo|ney
now, more than ever, became nece&s;&s;ary, in order to
repair &s;o great a breach in the alliance, and to &s;upport a
prince who was &s;o nearly related to Charles, and who had
been engaged in the war chiefly by the intrigues, &s;ollicita|tions,
and promi&s;es of the Engli&s;h monarch. After &s;ome
deliberation, an act of council was pa&s;&s;ed, importing, that,
as the urgency of affairs admitted not the way of parlia|ment,
the mo&s;t &s;peedy, equal, and convenient method of
&s;upply was by a GENERAL LOAN from the &s;ubject, ac|cording
as every man was a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in the rolls of the la&s;t
&s;ub&s;idy. That preci&s;e &s;um was required, which each would
<PB N="163" REF="199">
have paid, had the vote of four &s;ub&s;idies been pa&s;&s;ed into a
law: But care was taken to inform the people, that the
&s;ums exacted were not to be called &s;ub&s;idies, but loans<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Ru&s;h. vol. i. p. 418. Whitlocke, p. 8.</NOTE>.
Had any doubt remained, that forced loans were a violation
of liberty, and mu&s;st, by nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equence, render all
parliaments &s;uperfluous; this was the proper expedient for
opening the eyes of the whole nation.</P>
<P>THE commi&s;&s;ioners appointed to levy the&s;e loans, among
other articles of &s;ecret in&s;truction, were enjoined, &startq;If
any &s;all refu&s;e to lend, and &s;hall make delays or excu&s;es,
and per&s;i&s;t in his ob&s;tinacy, that they examine him upon
oath, whether he has been dealt with to deny or refu&s;e to
lend, or make an excu&s;e for not lending? Who has dealt
with him, and what &s;peeches or per&s;ua&s;ions were u&s;ed to
that purpo&s;e? And that they al&s;o &s;hall charge every &s;uch
per&s;on, in his Maje&s;ty's name, upon his allegiance, not
to di&s;clo&s;e to any one what his an&s;wer was<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Ru&s;hworth, vol. i. P. 419. Franklyn, p. 207.</NOTE>.&endq; So vio|lent
an inqui&s;itorial power, &s;o impracticable an attempt at
&s;ecrecy, were the objects of indignation, and even in &s;ome
degree of ridicule.</P>
<P>THAT religious prejudices might &s;upport civil authority,
fermons were preached by Sibthorpe and Manwaring, in fa|vour
of the general loan; and the court very indu&s;rrou&s;ly
&s;pread them over the kingdom. Pa&s;&s;ive obedience, was there
recommended in its full extent, the whole authority of the
&s;tate was repre&s;ented as belonging to the King alone, and
all limitations of laws and con&s;tutions were rejected as fe|ditious
and impious<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Ru&s;h, vol. i. p. 422. Franklyn, p. 208.</NOTE>. So openly was this doctrine e&s;pou&s;ed
by the King, that Archbi&s;hop Abbot, a popular and virtu|ous
prelate, becau&s;e he would not licen&s;e Sibthorpe's fer|mon,
was &s;u&s;pended from the exerci&s;e of his office, bani&s;hed
from London, and confined to one of his country-feats<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Ru&s;hworth, vol. i. p. 431</NOTE>.
Abbot's principles of liberty, and his oppo&s;ition to Buck|ingham,
<PB N="164" REF="200">
had always rendered him very ungracious at court,
and had acquired him the character of a puritan. For 'tis
remarkable, that that party made the privileges of the na|tion
as much a part of their religion, as the church-party
did the prerogatives of the crown; and nothing tended
farther to recommend among the people, who always take
opinions in the lump, the whole &s;y&s;tem and principles, of
the former &s;ect. The King &s;oon found, by fatal experience,
that this engine of religion, which with &s;o little nece&s;&s;ity
was introduced into politics, falling under more fortunate
management, was played with the mo&s;t terrible &s;ucce&s;s
again&s;t him.</P>
<P>WHILE the King, in&s;tigated by anger and nece&s;&s;ity, thus
employed the whole extent of his prerogative, the &s;pirit
of the people was far from being &s;ubdued. Throughout
all England, many refu&s;ed the&s;e loans, and &s;ome were even
active in encouraging their neighbours to in&s;i&s;t upon their
common rights and privileges. By warrant of the council,
<HI>the&s;e</HI> were thrown into pri&s;on<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Ru&s;hworth, vol. i. p. 429. Franklyn, p. 210.</NOTE>. Mo&s;t of them with pa|tience
&s;ubmitted to confinement, or applied by petition to
the King, who commonly relea&s;ed them. Five gentlemen
alone, Sir Thomas Darnel, Sir John Corbet, Sir Walter
Earl, Sir John Heveningham, and Sir Edmond Hambden,
had &s;pirit enough, at their own hazard and experice, to defend
the public liberties, and to demand relea&s;ement, not
as a favour from the court, but as their due, by the laws
of their country<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Ru&s;h, vol. i. p. 458. Franklyn, p. 224. Whitlocke, P. 8.</NOTE> No particular cau&s;e was a&s;&s;igned of
their confinement. The &s;pecial command alone of the King
and council was pleaded. And it was a&s;&s;erted, that, by law,
this was not &s;u&s;&s;icient rea&s;on for refu&s;ing bail or relea&s;ement
to the pri&s;oners.</P>
<P>THIS que&s;tion was brought to a &s;olemn trial,<NOTE PLACE="marg">November</NOTE> before the
king's bench; and the whole kingdom was attentive to the
<PB N="165" REF="201">
issue of a cau&s;e, which was of much greater con&s;equence
than the event of many battles.</P>
<P>BY the debates on this &s;ubject, it appeared, beyond con|trover&s;y,
to the nation, that their ance&s;tors had been &s;o
jealous of per&s;onal liberty, as to &s;ecure it again&s;t arbitrary
power in the crown, by &s;ix<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">25 Edw. III. cap. 4. 28 Edw. III. cap. 3. 37 Edw. III. cap. 18, 38 Edward III. cap. 9. 42 Edward III. cap. 3. I Richard II. cap. 12.</NOTE> &s;everal &s;tatutes, and by an
article<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Chap. 29.</NOTE> of the GREAT CHARTER it&s;elf, the mo&s;t &s;acred
foundation of the laws and con&s;titution. But the kings of
England, who had not been able to prevent the enacting
the&s;e laws, had &s;ufficient authority, when the tide of liberty
was &s;pent, to hinder their regular execution; and they
deemed it &s;uperfluous to attempt the formal repeal of &s;ta|tutes,
which they found &s;o many expedients and pretences
to elude. Turbulent and &s;editious times frequently oc|curred,
when the &s;afety of the people ab&s;olutely required
the confinement of factious leaders; and by the genius of
the old con&s;titution, the prince, of him&s;elf, was accu&s;tomed
to a&s;&s;ume every branch of prerogative which was found ne|ce&s;&s;ary
for the pre&s;ervation of public peace and of his own
authority. Expediency, at other times, would cover it&s;elf
under the appearance of nece&s;&s;ity; and, in proportion as
precedents multiplied, the will alone of the &s;overeign was
&s;ufficient to supply the place of expediency, of which he
con&s;tituted himself the &s;ole judge. Tho' rebellious &s;ub|jects
had frequently, in the open field, re&s;i&s;ted the King's
authority; no per&s;on had been found so bold, while con|fined
and at mercy, as to &s;et himself in oppo&s;ition to regal
power, and to claim the protection of the laws and con&s;ti|tution,
again&s;t the will of the &s;overeign. It was not till
this age, when the &s;pirit of liberty was univer&s;ally diffu&s;ed,
when the principles of government were nearly reduced to
a &s;y&s;tem, that the&s;e five gentlemen above-mentioned, by a
noble effort, ventured, in this national cause, to bring the
<PB N="166" REF="202">
que&s;tion to a final determination.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1627.</NOTE> And the King was a&s;to|ni&s;hed
to ob&s;erve, that a power, exerci&s;ed by his predece&s;|&s;ors
almost without interruption, was found, upon trial, to
be directly oppo&s;ite to the cleare&s;t laws, and &s;upported by
few undoubted precedents in courts of judicature. The&s;e
had &s;carcely, in any in&s;tance, refu&s;ed bail upon the com|mitments
by &s;pecial command of the king; becau&s;e the
per&s;ons committed had &s;eldom or never dared to demand it;
at lea&s;t in&s;i&s;t on their demand.</P>
<P>SIR Randolf Crew, lord chief ju&s;tice, had been di&s;|placed,
as unfit for the purpo&s;es of the court: Sir Nicholas
Hyde, e&s;teemed more ob&s;equious, had obtained that high
office: Yet the judges, by his direction, went no farther
than to remand the gentlemen to their pri&s;ons, and refu&s;e
the bail which was offered<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Ru&s;hwerth, vol. i. p. 462.</NOTE> Heathe, the attorney-general,
in&s;i&s;ted, that the court, in imitation of the judges in the
34th of Elizabeth<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">State Trials, vol. vii. p. 147.</NOTE>, &s;hould enter a general judgment, that
no bail could be granted, upon a commitment by the King
or council<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">State Trials, ibid. p. 161.</NOTE>. But the judges wi&s;ely declined complying.
The nation, they &s;aw, were already, to the la&s;t degree, ex|a&s;perated.
In the pre&s;ent di&s;po&s;ition of mens minds, uni|ver&s;al
complaints prevailed, as if the kingdom were reduced
to &s;lavery. And the mo&s;t invidious prerogative of the crown,
it was &s;aid, that of impri&s;oning the &s;ubject, is here openly
and &s;olemnly, and in numerous in&s;tances, exerci&s;ed for the
mo&s;t invidious purpo&s;e; in order to extort loans, or rather
&s;ub&s;idies, without con&s;ent of parliament.</P>
<P>BUT this was not the only hard&s;hip, of which the na|tion
then thought that they had rea&s;on to complain. The
army, which had made the fruitle&s;s expedition to Cadiz,
were di&s;per&s;ed throughout the kingdom; and money was
levied upon the counties, for the payment of their quar|ters<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Ru&s;h. vol. i. p. 419.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="167" REF="203">
THE &s;oldiers were billetted upon private hou&s;es, contrary
to cu&s;tom, which required, that, in all ordinary ca&s;es,
they &s;hould be quartered in inns and public hou&s;es<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Ru&s;h worth, vol. i. p. 419.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THOSE, who had refu&s;ed or delayed the loan, were &s;ure
to be loaded with a greater number of the&s;e dangerous and
di&s;orderly gue&s;ts.</P>
<P>MANY too, of low condition, who had &s;hewn a refractory
di&s;po&s;ition, were pre&s;&s;ed into the &s;ervice, and inli&s;ted in the
fleet or army<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Ibid, vol. i. p. 422.</NOTE>. Sir Peter Hayman, for the &s;ame rea&s;on,
was dispatched on an errand into the Palatinate<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Ibid. vol. i. $. 431.</NOTE>: Glan|ville,
an eminent lawyer, had been obliged, during the
former interval of parliament, to accept of an office in the
navy<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Parlia. Hi&s;t. vol. vii. p. 310.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE &s;oldiers, ill-paid and undi&s;ciplined, committed
many crimes and outrages; and increa&s;ed extremely the
public di&s;contents. To prevent these di&s;orders, martial
law, so nece&s;&s;ary to the &s;upport of di&s;cipline, was ex|erci&s;ed
upon the &s;oldiers. By a contradiction, which is
very natural, when the people are exa&s;perated, the out|rages
of the army were complained of; the remedy was
thought &s;till more intolerable<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Ru&s;hworth, vol. i. p. 419. Whitlocke, p. 7.</NOTE>. Though the expediency,
if we are not rather to say the nece&s;&s;ity, of martial law,
had formerly been deemed, of it&s;elf, a &s;ufficient ground for
e&s;tablishing it; men, now become more jealous of liberty,
find more refined rea&s;oners in que&s;tions of government, re|garded,
as illegal and arbitrary, every exerci&s;e of autho|rity,
which was not &s;upported by expre&s;s &s;tatute, or unin|terrupted
precedent.</P>
<P>IT may &s;afely be affirmed, that, except a few courtiers
or eccle&s;ia&s;tics, all men were di&s;plea&s;ed with this high exer|tion
of prerogative, and this new &s;pirit of admini&s;tration.
Though, antient precedents were pleaded in favour of the
King's mea&s;ures; a great difference, upon compari&s;on, was
<PB N="168" REF="204">
ob&s;erved between the ca&s;es. Acts of power, however irre|gular,
might; ca&s;ually and at intervals be exerci&s;ed by a
prince, for the &s;ake of di&s;patch or expediency; and yet li|berty
&s;till &s;ub&s;i&s;t, in &s;ome tolerable degree, under his admi|ni&s;tration.
But where all these were reduced into a &s;y&s;tem,
were exerted without interruption, were &s;tudiou&s;ly &s;ought
for, in order to supply the place of laws, and &s;ubdue the
refractory &s;pirit of the nation; it was nece&s;&s;ary to find &s;ome
&s;peedy remedy, or finally to abandon all hopes of pre&s;erving
the freedom of the con&s;titution. Nor could moderate men
e&s;teem the provocation, which the King had received, though
great, &s;ufficient to warrant all the&s;e violent mea&s;ures. The
commons, as yet, had no wi&s;e invaded his authority: They
had only exerci&s;ed, as be&s;t plea&s;ed them, their own privi|leges.
Was he excu&s;able, becau&s;e, from one hou&s;e of par|liament,
he had met with har&s;h and unkind treatment, to
make, in revenge, an inva&s;ion on the rights and liberties of
the whole nation?</P>
<P>BUT great was at this time the &s;urprize of all men,<NOTE PLACE="marg">War with France.</NOTE> when
Charles, baffled in every attempt again&s;t the Au&s;trian domi|nions,
embroiled with his own &s;ubjects, un&s;upplied with any
trea&s;ure but what he extorted by the mo&s;t, invidious and mo&s;t
dangerous mea&s;ures; as if the half of Europe, now his
enemy, was not &s;ufficient for the exerci&s;e of military prowe&s;s;
wantonly attacked France, the other great kingdom in
his neighbourhood, and engaged at once in war again&s;t
the&s;e two powers, whose intere&s;ts were hitherto e&s;teemed so
incompatible, that they could never, it was thought, agree
either in the &s;ame friend&s;hips or enmities. All authentic
memoirs, both foreign and dome&s;tic, a&s;cribe to Bucking|ham's
coun&s;els this war with France, and repre&s;ent him, as
actuated by motives, which would appear incredible, were
we not &s;ufficiently acquainted with the extreme violence and
temerity of his character.</P>
<P><PB N="169" REF="205">
THE three great monarchies of Europe were at this time
ruled by young princes, Philip, Louis, and Charles, who
were nearly of the &s;ame age, and who had re&s;igned the go|vernment
of them&s;elves, and of their kingdoms, to their
creatures and mini&s;ters, Olivarez, Richelieu, and Buckingham.
The people, whom the moderate temper or narrow genius of
their princes, would have allowed to remain for ever in tranqui|lity,
were &s;trongly agitated by the emulation and jealou&s;y of
the mini&s;ters. Above all, the towering spirit of Richelieu,
incapable of re&s;t, promi&s;ed an active age, and gave indica|tions
of great revolutions throughout all Europe.</P>
<P>THIS man had no &s;ooner, by &s;upplene&s;s and intrigue, got
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the reins of government, than he formed, at
once, three mighty projects; to &s;ubdue the turbulent &s;pirits
of the great, to reduce the rebellious hugonots, and to curb
the encroaching power of the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria, Undaunted
and implacable, prudent and active; he braved all the oppo|&s;ition
of the French princes and nobles in the pro&s;ecution of
his vengeance; he di&s;covered and di&s;&s;ipated all their mo&s;t
&s;ecret cabals and con&s;piracies. His &s;overeign him&s;elf he
held in &s;ubjection, while he exalted the throne. The
people, while they lo&s;t their liberties, acquired, by means
of his admini&s;tration, learning, order, di&s;cipline, and re|nown.
That confu&s;ed and inaccurate genius of govern|ment,
which France partook in common with other Euro|pean
kingdoms, he changed into a &s;imple monarchy; at the
very time, when the incapacity of Buckingham encouraged
the free &s;pirit of the commons to e&s;tablish in England a re|gular
&s;ystem of liberty.</P>
<P>HOWEVER, unequal the compari&s;on between the&s;e mi|nisters,
Buckingham had entertained a mighty jealou&s;y again&s;t
Richelieu; a jealou&s;y not founded on rival&s;hip of power and
politics, but of love and gallantry; where the Duke was
as much &s;uperior to the Cardinal, as he was inferior in every
other particular.</P>
<P><PB N="170" REF="206">
AT the time, when Charles married by proxy the Prince&s;s,
Henrietta, the, Duke of Buckingham had been di&s;patched into
France, in order to grace the nuptials, and conduct the new
Queen into England. The eyes of the whole French court
were directed by curio&s;ity towards that man, who had enjoyed
the unlimited favour of two &s;ucce&s;&s;ive monarchs, and who,
from a private &s;tation, had mounted, in the earlie&s;t youth,
to the ab&s;olute government of three kingdoms. The ex|treme
beauty of his per&s;on, the gracefulness of his air, the
&s;plendor of his equipage, his fine ta&s;te in dre&s;s, fe&s;tivals,
and carou&s;als, corre&s;ponded to the prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions enter|tertained
in his favour: The affability of his behaviour,
the gaiety of his manners, the magnificence of his expence,
increa&s;ed &s;till farther the general admiration which was paid
him. All bu&s;ine&s;s being already concerted, the time was
intirely &s;pent in mirth and entertainments; and, during
tho&s;e &s;plendid &s;cenes, among that gay people, the Duke
found him&s;elf in a &s;ituation, where he was perfectly quali|fied
to excel<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Chrendon, vol. i. p. 38.</NOTE>. But his great &s;ucce&s;s at Paris proved as
fatal as his former failure at Madrid. Encouraged by the
&s;miles of the court, he dared to carry his ambitious ad|dresses
to the Queen her&s;elf; and he failed not to make im|pression
on a heart not undi&s;posed to the tender pa&s;&s;ions.
That attachment, at lea&s;t, of the mind, which appears so
delicious, and is &s;o dangerous, &s;eems to have been en|couraged
by the Princess; and the Duke pre&s;umed &s;o far
on her good graces, that, after his departure, he &s;ecretly
returned upon &s;ome pretence, and, paying a visit to the
Queen, was dismi&s;&s;ed with a reproof, which favoured more
of kindne&s;s than of anger<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Memoires do Mad. de Motteville.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>INFORMATION of this corre&s;pondence was, &s;oon carried
to Richelieu. The vigilance of that mini&s;ter was here
farther rouzed by jealou&s;y. He too, either from vanity or
politics, had ventured to pay his addre&s;&s;es to the Queen.
<PB N="171" REF="207">
But a prie&s;t, pa&s;t middle age, of a &s;evere character, and
occupied in the mo&s;t exten&s;ive plans of ambition or ven|geance,
was but an unequal match in that conte&s;t, for a
young courtier, intirely di&s;po&s;ed to gaiety and gallantry.
The Cardinal's di&s;appointment &s;trongly inclined him to
counter-work the amorous projects of his rival. When the
Duke was making preparations for a new emba&s;&s;y to Paris,
a me&s;&s;age was &s;ent him from Louis, that he mu&s;t not think
of &s;uch a journey. In a romantic pa&s;&s;ion, he &s;wore, <HI>That
he would &s;ee the Queen, &s;pite of all the power of France;</HI>
and, from that moment, he was determined to engage
England in a war with that kingdom<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Clarendon, vol. i. p. 38.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>HE fir&s;t took advantage of &s;ome quarrels, excited by the
Queen of England's attendants; and he per&s;uaded Charles
to di&s;mi&s;s, at once, all her French &s;ervants, contrary to the
articles of the marriage treaty<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Ru&s;hworth, vol. i. p. 423, 424.</NOTE>. He encouraged the
Engli&s;h &s;hips of war and privateers to &s;eize ve&s;&s;els belonging
to French merchants; and <HI>the&s;e</HI> he forthwith condemned as
prizes by a &s;entence of the court of admiralty. But
finding, that all the&s;e injuries produced only remon&s;trances
and emba&s;&s;ies, or at mo&s;t reprizals, on the part of France;
he re&s;olved to &s;econd the intrigues of the Duke of Soubize,
and to undertake at once a military expedition again&s;t that
nation.</P>
<P>SOUBIZE, who, with his brother, the Duke of Rohan,
was the leader of the hugonot faction, was at that time in
London, and &s;trongly &s;ollicited Charles to embrace the pro|tection
of the&s;e di&s;tre&s;&s;ed religioni&s;ts. He repre&s;ented, That,
after the inhabitants of Rochelle had been repre&s;&s;ed by the
combined &s;quadrons of England and Holland, after peace
was concluded with the French King under Charles's me|diation,
the ambitious Cardinal was &s;till meditating the
de&s;truction of the hugonots; that preparations were &s;ilently
making in every province of France for the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of
<PB N="172" REF="208">
their religion; that forts were erected in order to bridle
Rochelle, the mo&s;t con&s;iderable bulwark of the prote&s;tants;
that the reformed in France ca&s;t their eyes on Charles as the
head of their faith, and con&s;idered him as a prince engaged
by intere&s;t, as well as inclination, to &s;upport them; that &s;o
long as their party &s;ub&s;i&s;ted, Charles might rely on their
obedience, as much as on that of his own &s;ubjects; but,
if their liberties were once ravi&s;hed from them, the power
of France, freed from this impediment, would &s;oon be|come
formidable to England, and to all the neighbouring
nations.</P>
<P>THOUGH Charles probably bore but &s;mall favour to the
hugonots,<NOTE PLACE="marg">9th of July. Expendition to the i&s;le of Rh$.</NOTE> who &s;o much re&s;embled the puritans, in di&s;cipline
and wor&s;hip, in religion and politics; he yet allowed him|&s;elf
to be gained by the&s;e arguments, inforced by the &s;o|licitations
of Buckingham. A fleet of an hundred &s;ail,
and an army of 7000 men, were fitted out for the inva&s;ion
of France, and both of them entru&s;ted to the command of
the Duke, who was altogether unacquainted both with land
and &s;ea-&s;ervice. The fleet appeared before Rochelle: But
&s;o ill-concerted were the Duke's mea&s;ures, that the inhabi|tants
of that city &s;hut their gates, and refu&s;ed to admit al|lies,
of who&s;e coming they were not previou&s;ly informed<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Ru&s;hworth, vol. i. p. 426.</NOTE>.
All his military operations &s;howed equal incapacity and in|experience.
In&s;tead of attacking Oleron, a fertile i&s;land
and defencele&s;s, he bent his cour&s;e to the i&s;le of Rh&eacute;, which
was well garri&s;oned and fortified: Having landed his men,
tho' with &s;ome lo&s;s, he followed not the blow, but allowed
Toiras, the French governor, five days re&s;pite; during
which St. Martin was victualed and provided for a &s;iege<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Whitlocke, p. 8. Sir Philip War|wick, p. 25.</NOTE>.
He left behind him the &s;mall fort of Prie, which could
at fir&s;t have made no manner of re&s;i&s;tance: Though re&s;olved
<PB N="173" REF="209">
to &s;tarve St. Martin,<NOTE PLACE="marg">28th of Oct.</NOTE> he guarded the &s;ea negligently, and
allowed provi&s;ions and ammunition, to be thrown into it:
De&s;pairing to reduce it by famine, he attacked it without
having made any breach, and ra&s;hly threw away the lives of
the &s;oldiers: Having found, that a French army had &s;tolen
over in &s;mall divi&s;ions, and had landed at Prie, the fort
which he had at fir&s;t overlooked; he began to think of a
retreat; but made it &s;o un&s;kilfully, that it was equivalent
to a total rout: He was the la&s;t, of the whole army, that
embarked; and he returned to England, having lo&s;t two
thirds of his land forces; totally di&s;credited both as an ad|miral
and a general; and bringing no prai&s;e with him, but
that vulgar one of courage and per&s;onal bravery.</P>
<P>THE Duke of Rohan, who had taken arms as &s;oon as
Buckingham appeared upon the coa&s;t, di&s;covered the dan|gerous
&s;pirit of the &s;ect, without being able to do any
mi&s;chief: The inhabitants of Rochelle, who had at la&s;t
been induced to join them&s;elves to the Engli&s;h, ha&s;tened the
vengeance of their ma&s;ter, exhau&s;ted their provi&s;ions in
&s;upplying their allies, and were threatened with an imme|diate
&s;iege. Such were the fruits of Buckingham's expe|dition

<P>THERE was rea&s;on to apprehend &s;ome di&s;order or in|&s;urrection

among the people. Their liberties, they believed, were

which had met with a &s;evere check from the Spani&s;h, was
totally annihilated by the French war; tho&s;e military ho|nours,

greater calamities were dreaded from the war with the&s;e,
powerful monarchies, concurring with the internal di&s;orders,
under which the nation laboured. And the&s;e ills were
a&s;cribed, not to the refractory di&s;po&s;ition of the two for|mer
parliaments, to which they were partly owing; but
&s;olely to Charles's ob&s;tinacy, in adhering to the coun&s;els of
Buckingham; a man no wi&s;e intitled, by his birth, age,
&s;ervices, or merit, to that unlimited confidence, repo&s;ed in
him. To be &s;acrificed to the intere&s;t, policy, and ambi|tion

that they may appear unrea&s;onable, who would pretend to
complain of it: But to be the victim of the frivolous gal|lantry

<P><PB N="175" REF="211">
IN this &s;ituation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. LI.</NOTE> it may be imagined, the King and the
Duke dreaded,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Third Par|liament.</NOTE> above all things, the a&s;&s;embling a parliament:
But, &s;o little fore&s;ight had they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in their enter|prizing
&s;chemes, that they found them&s;elves under an ab&s;o|lute
nece&s;&s;ity of embracing that expedient. The money
levied, or rather extorted, under colour of prerogative, had
come in very &s;lowly, and had left &s;uch ill-humour in the nation,
that it appeared dangerous to renew the experiment. The
ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity of &s;upply, it was hoped, would engage
the commons to forget all pa&s;t injuries; and, having expe|rienced
the ill effects of former ob&s;tinacy, they would pro|bably
a&s;&s;emble with a re&s;olution of making &s;ome rea&s;onable
compliances. The more to &s;often them, it was concerted,
by Sir Robert Cotton's advice<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Franklyn, p. 230.</NOTE>, that Buckingham &s;hould
be the fir&s;t per&s;on, who propo&s;ed in council the calling a
new parliament. Having laid in this &s;tock of merit, he
expected, that all his former mi&s;demeanors would be over|looked
and forgiven, and that, in&s;tead of a tyrant and op|pre&s;&s;or,
he &s;hould be regarded as the fir&s;t patriot in the
nation.</P>
<P>THE views of the popular leaders were much more ju|dicious
and profound.<NOTE PLACE="marg">March 17.</NOTE> When the commons a&s;&s;embled,
they appeared to be men of the &s;ame independent &s;pirit with
their predece&s;&s;ors, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;uch riches, that their
property was computed to &s;urpa&s;s three times that of the
hou&s;e of peers<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Sander&s;on, p. 106. Walker, p. 339.</NOTE>; they were deputed by boroughs and
counties, inflamed, all of them, by the late violations of
liberty; many of the members them&s;elves had been ca&s;t

yet, notwith&s;tanding all the&s;e circum&s;tances, which might
prompt them to embrace violent re&s;olutions, they entered
upon bu&s;ine&s;s with perfect temper and decorum. They
con&s;idered, that the King, di&s;gu&s;ted at the&s;e popular a&s;&s;em|blies,
and little prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in favour of their privileges,
<PB N="176" REF="212">
wanted but a fair pretence of breaking with them, and
would &s;eize the fir&s;t opportunity offered by any incident or
undutiful behaviour of the members. He fairly told them,
in his fir&s;t &s;peech, that, &startq;If they &s;hould not do their du|ties,

mu&s;t, in di&s;charge of his con&s;cience, u&s;e tho&s;e other
means, which God had put into his hands, in order to
&s;ave that which the follies of &s;ome particular men may
otherwi&s;e put in danger. Take not this for a threaten|ing,&endq;
added the King,&startq;for I &s;corn to threaten any but

nature and duty, has mo&s;t care of your pre&s;ervation and
pro&s;perity<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Ru&s;hworth, vol. i. p. 477. Franklyn, p. 233.</NOTE>.&endq; The Lord keeper, by the King's direction,

but becau&s;e it is mo&s;t agreeable to the goodne&s;s of his own
mo&s;t gracious di&s;po&s;ition, and to the de&s;ire and weal of
his people. If this be deferred, nece&s;&s;ity and the &s;word
of the enemy make way to the others. Remember his
Maje&s;ty's admonition, I &s;ay, remember it<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Ru&s;hworth, vol. i. p. 479. Franklyn, p. 234.</NOTE>.&endq; From
the&s;e avowed maxims, the commons fore&s;aw, that, if the
lea&s;t handle was afforded, the King would immediately di&s;|&s;olve
them, and would thenceforward deem him&s;elf ju&s;ti|fied
for violating, in a manner &s;till more open, all the antient
forms of the con&s;titution. No remedy could then looked
for, but from in&s;urrections and civil war, of which the
i&s;&s;ue would be extremely uncertain, and which mu&s;t, in
all events, prove infinitely calamitous to the whole nation.
To correct the late di&s;orders in the admini&s;tration required
&s;ome new laws, which would, no doubt, appear har&s;h to
a prince, &s;o enamoured of his prerogative; and it was re|qui&s;ite
to temper, by the decency and moderation of their
debates, the rigour, which mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily attend their
<PB N="177" REF="213">
determinations. Nothing can give us a higher idea of the
capacity of tho&s;e men, who now guided the commons, and
of the great authority, which they had acquired, than the
forming and executing &s;o judicious and &s;o difficult a plan of
operations.</P>
<P>THE decency, however, which the popular leaders had
pre&s;cribed to them&s;elves, and recommended to others,
hindered them not from making the loude&s;t and mo&s;t
vigorous complaints again&s;t the grievances, under which
the nation had lately laboured. Sir Francis Seymour &s;aid,
&startq;This is the great council of the kingdom, and here with
certainty, if not here only, his Maje&s;ty may &s;ee, as in a
true gla&s;s, the &s;tate of the kingdom. We are called hither
by his writs, in order to give him faithful coun&s;el; &s;uch as
may &s;tand with his honour: And this we mu&s;t do with|out
flattery. We are all &s;ent hither by the people, in
order to deliver their ju&s;t grievances: And this we mu&s;t
do without fear. Let us not act like Camby&s;es's judges,
who, when their approbation was demanded by the
prince to &s;ome illegal mea&s;ure, &s;aid, that, <HI>Though there
was a written law, the Per&s;ian kings might follow their
own will and plea&s;ure.</HI> This was ba&s;e flattery, fitter for
our reproof than our imitation; and as fear, &s;o flattery,
taketh away the judgment. For my part, I &s;hall &s;hun
both; and &s;peak my mind with as much duty, as any
man, to his Maje&s;ty, without neglecting the public.</P>
<P>BUT how can we expre&s;s our affections, while we re|tain
our fears; or &s;peak of giving, till we know whe|ther
we have any thing to give. For, if his Maje&s;ty
may be per&s;uaded to take what he will, what need we
give?</P>
<P>THAT this hath been done, appeareth by the billetting
of &s;oldiers, a thing no wi&s;e advantageous to the King's
&s;ervice, and a burthen to the commonwealth: By the
impri&s;onment of gentlemen for refu&s;ing the loan, who,
<PB N="178" REF="214">
if they had done the contrary, for fear, had been a$
blameable as the projectors of that oppre&s;&s;ive mea&s;ure.
To countenance the&s;e proceedings, hath it not been
preached in the pulpit, or rather prated, that <HI>All we
have is the King's by divine right?</HI> But when preachers
for&s;ake their own calling, and turn ignorant &s;tate&s;men;
we &s;ee how willing they are to exchange a good con&s;ci|ence
for a bi&s;hopric.</P>
<P>HE, I mu&s;t confe&s;s, is no good &s;ubject, who would
not, willingly and cheerfully, lay down his life, when
that &s;acrifice may promote the intere&s;ts of his &s;overeign,
and the good of the commonwealth. But he is not a good
&s;ubject, he is a &s;lave, who will allow his goods to be
taken from him again&s;t his will, and his liberty again&s;t
the laws of the kingdom. By oppo&s;ing the&s;e practices,
we &s;hall but tread in the &s;teps of our forefathers, who
&s;till preferred the public before their private intere&s;t, nay,
before their very lives. It will in us be a wrong done
to our&s;elves, to our po&s;terities, to our con&s;ciences, if we

way to break a parliament? No: Our de&s;ires are mode&s;t
and ju&s;t. I &s;peak both for the intere&s;t of King and
people. If we enjoy not the&s;e rights, it will be im|po&s;&s;ible
for us to relieve him. Let us never therefore,
doubt of a favourable reception from his goodne&s;s<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Franklyn, p. 243. Ru&s;hworth, vol. i. p. 500.</NOTE>.&endq;</P>
<P>THESE &s;entiments were unanimou&s;ly embraced by the
whole hou&s;e. Even the court party pretended not to plead,
in defence of the late mea&s;ures, any thing but the nece&s;&s;ity,
to which the King had been reduced, by the ob&s;tinacy of
<PB N="181" REF="217">
the two former parliaments. A vote, therefore, was pa&s;&s;ed
without oppo&s;ition, again&s;t arbitrary impri&s;onments and
forced loans<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Franklyn, p. 251. Ru&s;hworth, vol. i. p. 513. Whitlocke, p, 9.</NOTE>. And the &s;pirit of liberty having obtained
&s;ome &s;atisfaction by this exertion of it&s;elf, the King's re|iterated
me&s;&s;ages, who pre&s;&s;ed for &s;upply, were attended to
with better temper. Five &s;ub&s;idies were voted him; with
which, though much inferior to his wants, he declared
him&s;elf well &s;atisfied; and even tears of affection &s;tarted
in his eye, when he was informed of this conce&s;&s;ion. The
Duke's approbation too was mentioned by Secretary Coke;
but the conjunction of a &s;ubject with the &s;overeign was ill
received by the hou&s;e<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Ru&s;hworth, vol. i. p. 526. Whitlocke, p. 9.</NOTE>. Though di&s;gu&s;ted with the King,
the jealou&s;y, which they felt for his honour, was more &s;en|&s;ible
than that, which his unbounded confidence in the
Duke would allow even him&s;elf to entertain.</P>
<P>THE &s;upply, though voted, was not, as yet, pa&s;&s;ed
into a law; and the commons re&s;olved to employ the interval,
in providing &s;ome barriers to their rights and liberties, &s;o
lately violated. They knew, that their own vote, declaring
the illegality of the former mea&s;ures, had not, of it&s;elf,
&s;ufficient authority to &s;ecure the con&s;titution again&s;t all fu|ture
inva&s;ion. Some act to that purpo&s;e mu&s;t receive the
&s;anction of the whole legi&s;lature; and they appointed a
committee to prepare the model of &s;o important a law. By
collecting into one effort all the dangerous and oppre&s;&s;ive
claims of his prerogative, Charles had expo&s;ed them to the
hazard of one a&s;&s;ault; and had farther, by pre&s;enting a
nearer view of the con&s;equences attending them, rouzed the
independent genius of the commons. Forced loans, bene|volences,
taxes without con&s;ent of parliament, arbitrary
impri&s;onments, billetting &s;oldiers, martial law; the&s;e were
the grievances complained of, and again&s;t the&s;e an eternal
remedy was to be provided. The commons pretended not,
<PB N="182" REF="218">
as they affirmed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Petition of Right.</NOTE> to any unu&s;ual powers or privileges:
They aimed only at &s;ecuring tho&s;e tran&s;mitted them from their
ancestors: And their law they re&s;olved to call a PETITION
OF RIGHT; as implying that it contained a corroboration
or explanation of the antient con&s;titution, not any infringe|ment
of royal prerogative, or acqui&s;ition of new liberties.</P>
<P>WHILE the committee was employed in framing the pe|tition
of right, the favourers of each party, both in par|liament
and throughout the nation, were engaged in di&s;|di&s;putes
about this bill, which, in all likelihood, was to
form a memorable aera in the Engli&s;h government.</P>
<P>THAT the &s;tatutes, &s;aid the partizans of the commons,
which &s;ecure Engli&s;h liberty, are not become ob&s;olete, ap|pears
hence, that the Engli&s;h have ever been free, and have
ever been governed by law and a limited con&s;titution. Pri|vileges
in particular, which are founded on the GREAT
CHARTER, mu&s;t always remain in force, becau&s;e derived
from a &s;ource of never-failing authority; regarded in all
age, as the mo&s;t &s;acred contract between king and people.
Such attention was paid to this charter by our generous an|ce&s;tors,
that they got the confirmation of it re-iterated
thirty &s;everal times; and even &s;ecured it by a law, which
&s;eems in the execution impracticable. They enacted, <HI>That
no &s;tatute, which &s;hould be afterwards enacted in contra|diction
to any article of that charter, &s;hould ever have any
force or validity.</HI> But with regard to that important ar|ticle,
which &s;ecures per&s;onal liberty; &s;o far from attempt|ing,
at any time, any legal infringement of it, they have
corroborated it by &s;ix &s;tatutes, and put it out of all doubt
and controver&s;y. If in practice it has often been violated,
abu&s;es can never come in place of rules; nor can any rights
or legal powers be derived from injury and inju&s;tice. But
the &s;ubjects title to per&s;onal liberty is not founded only on
antient, and therefore, the mo&s;t &s;acred laws: It is con|firmed
by the whole ANALOGY of the government and
<PB N="183" REF="219">
con&s;titution. A free monarchy, in which every individual
is a &s;lave, is a glaring contradiction; and it is requi&s;ite,
where the laws a&s;&s;ign privileges to the different orders of
the &s;tate, that it likewi&s;e &s;ecure the independence of all the
members. If any difference could be made in this particu|lar,
it were better to abandon even life or property to the
arbitrary will of the prince; nor would &s;uch immediate
danger en&s;ue, from that conce&s;&s;ion, to the laws and to the pri|vileges
of the people. To bereave of his life a man not con|demned
on any legal trial, is &s;o egregious an exerci&s;e of
tyranny, as mu&s;t at once &s;hock the natural humanity of
princes, and convey an alarm through the whole common-wealth.
To confi&s;cate a man's fortune, be&s;ides its being a
mo&s;t atrocious act of violence, expo&s;es the monarch &s;o
much to the imputation of avarice and rapacity, that it
will &s;eldom be attempted in any civilized government. But
confinement, though a le&s;s &s;triking, is no le&s;s &s;evere a pu|ni&s;hment; nor is there any &s;pirit, &s;o erect and independent,
as not to be broke by the long continuance of the &s;ilent and
inglorious &s;ufferings of a jail. The power of impri&s;on|ment,
therefore, being the mo&s;t natural and potent engine
of arbitrary government, it is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to remove
it from a government which is free and legal.</P>
<P>THE partizans of the court rea&s;oned after a different
manner. The true rule of government, &s;aid they, during
any period, is that to which the people, from time, imme|morial,
have been accu&s;tomed, and to which they naturally
pay a prompt obedience. A practice, which has ever
&s;truck their &s;en&s;es, and of which they have &s;een and heard
innumerable precedents, has an authority with them much
&s;uperior to that which attends maxims derived from anti|quated
&s;tatutes and mouldy records. In vain do the lawyers
e&s;tabli&s;h it as a principle, that a &s;tatute can never be abrogated
by oppo&s;ite cu&s;tom; but requires to be expre&s;sly repeatled
by a contrary &s;tatute: While they pretend to inculcate an
<PB N="184" REF="220">
axiom, peculiar to Engli&s;h juri&s;prudence, they violate the mo&s;t
e&s;tablished principles of human nature; and even, by nece&s;|&s;ary
con&s;equence, rea&s;on in contradiction to law itelf, which
they would repre&s;ent as &s;o &s;acred and inviolable. A law, to
have any authority, mu&s;t be derived from a legi&s;lature, which
has right. And whence do all legi&s;latures derive their
right but from long cu&s;tom and e&s;tablished practice? If a
&s;tatute, contrary to public good, has, at any time, been
ra&s;hly voted and a&s;&s;ented to, either from the violence of
faction, or the inexperience of &s;enates and princes; it can|not
be more effectually abrogated, than by a train of con|trary
precedents, which prove, that, from common con&s;ent,
it has tacitly been &s;et a&s;ide, as inconvenient and impracti|cable.
Such has been the ca&s;e with all tho&s;e &s;tatues
enacted during turbulent times, in order to limit royal pre|rogative,
and cramp the &s;overeign in his protection of the
public, and his execution of the laws. But above all the
branches of prerogative, that which is mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary to be
pre&s;erved, is the power of impri&s;onment. Faction and di&s;|content,
like di&s;ea&s;es, frequently ari&s;e in every political
body; and, during the&s;e di&s;orders, 'tis by the &s;alutry ex|erci&s;e
alone of this di&s;cretionary power, that rebellions and
civil wars can be prevented. To circum&s;cribe this power,
is to de&s;troy its nature: Intirely to abrogate it, is impracti|cable;
and the attempt it&s;elf mu&s;t prove dangerous, if not
pernicious to the public. The &s;upreme magi&s;trate, in cri|tical
and turbulent times, will never, agreeable either to
prudence or duty, allow the &s;tate to peri&s;h, while there re|mains
a remedy, which, however irregular, it is &s;till in his
power to apply. And if, moved by a regard to public good,
he employs any exerci&s;e of power, condemned by recent
and expre&s;s &s;tatute; how greedily, in &s;uch dangerous times,
will factious leaders &s;eize this pretence of throwing on his
government the imputation of tyranny and de&s;poti&s;m?
Were the alternative quite nece&s;&s;ary, it were &s;urely much
<PB N="185" REF="221">
better for human &s;ociety to be deprived of liberty than to be
de&s;titute of government.</P>
<P>IMPARTIAL rea&s;oners will confe&s;s, that this &s;ubject is
not, on both &s;ides, without its difficulties. Where a ge|neral
and rigid law is enacted again&s;t arbitrary impri&s;on|ments,
it would appear, that government cannot in times of
&s;edition and faction, be conducted but by temporary &s;u&s;|pen&s;ions
of the law; and &s;uch an expedient, during the age
of Charles, was never thought of. The meetings of par|liament
were too precarious, and their determinations might
be too dilatory, to &s;erve in ca&s;es of urgent nece&s;&s;ity. Nor
was it then conceived, that a King did not po&s;&s;e&s;s of him|&s;elf
&s;ufficient power for the &s;ecurity and protection of his
people, or that the authority of the&s;e popular a&s;&s;emblies
was ever to become &s;o absolute, that the prince mu&s;t always
conform him&s;elf to it, and could never have any occa&s;ion to
guard again&s;t <HI>their</HI> practices, as well as again&s;t tho&s;e of his
other &s;ubjects.</P>
<P>THOUGH the hou&s;e of lords were not in&s;en&s;ible to the
reasons urged in favour of the pretensions of the commons,
they deemed the arguments, pleaded in favour of the crown,
&s;till more cogent and convincing. That a&s;&s;embly &s;eems,
during this whole period, to have acted, in the main, a
rea&s;onable and a moderate part; and if their bya&s;s inclined
a little too much, as is natural, to the &s;ide of monarchy,
they were far from entertaining any de&s;ign of &s;acrificing to
arbitrary will the liberties and privileges of the nation.
Ashley, the King's &s;erjeant, having a&s;&s;erted, in a pleading
before the peers, that the King mu&s;t sometimes govern by
acts of &s;tate as well as by law; this po&s;ition gave &s;uch of|fence,
that he was immediately committed to prison, and
was not relea&s;ed but upon his recantation and &s;ubmission<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Whitlo$k$ p. 10.</NOTE>.
Being, however, afraid, that the commons would go too
a far in their projected petition, the peers propo&s;ed a plan of
<PB N="186" REF="222">
one more moderate, which they recommended to the con|&s;ideration
of the other hou&s;e. It con&s;i&s;ted meerly in a ge|neral
declaration, That the great charter and the &s;ix &s;tatutes,
conceived to be explanations of it, &s;tand &s;till in force, to all in|tents
and purpo&s;es; that, in con&s;equence of the charter and
the &s;tatutes, and by the tenor of the antient cu&s;toms and laws
of the land, every &s;ubject has a fundamental property in his
goods, and a fundamental liberty of his per&s;on; that his pro|perty
and liberty are as intire at pre&s;ent as during any former
period of the Engli&s;h government; that in all common ca&s;es,
the common law ought to be the &s;tandard of proceedings:
&startq;And in ca&s;e, that, for the &s;ecurity of his Maje&s;ty's per|&s;on,
the general &s;afety of his people, or the peaceable go|vernment
of the kingdom, the King &s;hall find ju&s;t cau&s;e,
for rea&s;ons of &s;tate, to impri&s;on or re&s;train any man's
per&s;on; he was petitioned graciou&s;ly to declare, that
within a <HI>convenient</HI> time, he &s;hall and will expre&s;s the
cau&s;e of the commitment or re&s;traint, either general or
&s;pecial, and upon a cau&s;e &s;o expre&s;&s;ed, will leave the pri|&s;oner
immediately to be tried according to the common
law of the land.<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">State Trials, vol. vii. p. 187. Ru&s;hworth, vol. i. p. 546.</NOTE>.&endq;</P>
<P>$word$ Abbot was employed by the lords to re|commend,
$word$ a conference, this plan of a petition to the
hou&s;e of commons. The prelate, as was, no doubt, fore|&s;een
from his known principles, was not extremely urgent in
his applications; and the lower hou&s;e were fully convinced,
that the general declarations &s;ignified nothing, and that the
latter clau&s;e left their liberties rather in a wor&s;e condition
than before. They proceeded, therefore, with great zeal,
in framing the model of a petition, which &s;hould contain
expre&s;&s;ions, more preci&s;e, and more favorable to public
freedom.</P>
<P>THE King could ea&s;ily &s;ee the con&s;equences of the&s;e pro|ceedings.
Though he had offered at the beginning of the
&s;e&s;&s;ion, to give his con&s;ent to any law for the &s;ecurity of the
<PB N="187" REF="223">
rights and liberties of the people; he had not expected,
that &s;uch inroads &s;hould be made on his prerogative. In
order, therefore, to divert the commons from their inten|tion,
he &s;ent a me&s;&s;age, wherein he de&s;ired the hou&s;es,
&startq; Clearly to let him know, whether they will re&s;t upon his
royal promi&s;e in favour of their liberties: Which promi&s;e
he had given at &s;everal times, and chiefly by the Lord
Keeper's &s;peech made in his own pre&s;ence. If they rely
on it, he a&s;&s;ured them, it &s;hould be really and royally
performed<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">State Trials, vol. vii. p. 189. Ru&s;hworth, vol. i, p. 552.</NOTE>.&endq;</P>
<P>SECRETARY Coke, who delivered this me&s;&s;age, after
&s;ome preamble, and &s;ome apology for pa&s;t grievances, pro|ceeded
in this manner. &startq;When means were denied his
Maje&s;ty, being a young King and newly come to the
crown, which he found engaged in a war; what could
we expect in &s;uch nece&s;&s;ities? His Maje&s;ty has called this
parliament to make up the breach: His Maje&s;ty a&s;&s;ures
us, that we &s;hall not have like cau&s;e to complain: He
a&s;&s;ures us, that the laws &s;hall be eftabli&s;hed. What can
we de&s;ire more? The important point is, that we pro|vide
for po&s;terity, and prevent the like practices for the
future. Were not the &s;ame means provided by them be|fore
us? Can we do more? We &s;tand at pre&s;ent on the
confines between the liberty of the &s;ubject and the prero|gatives
of the King. I hope, that we &s;hall not pretend
to add any thing for our&s;elves, in order to depre&s;s
him. I will not divine: Yet I think, that, in &s;uch pre|ten&s;ions,
we &s;hall find difficulty with the King; nay, perhaps,
with the lords. For my part, I &s;hall not, as
counsellor to his Maje&s;ty, deliver any opinion, which I
will not openly declare and ju&s;tify, here, or at the coun|cil-board.
Will we, in this nece&s;&s;ity, &s;trive to bring
our&s;elves into a better condition and greater liberty than
our fathers enjoyed, and reduce the crown to a wor&s;e
than ever? I dare not advi&s;e his Maje&s;ty to give way to
&s;uch mea&s;ures. What we now de&s;ire, if it be no inno|vation,

is all contained in those acts and &s;tatutes; and
whatever more we &s;hall add is a diminution to the King's
power, and an acce&s;&s;ion to our own. We deal with a
wi&s;e and valiant prince, who hath a &s;word in his hand for
our good; and this good cannot be attained without
power. Do not think, that, by parliamentary debates,
or even by clau&s;es of &s;tatutes, we can make that to be
unlawful, which, by experience, we have found to be
derived from nece&s;&s;ity, and from a nece&s;&s;ity so urgent,
that it admits not of remedy from any law.&mdash;And I
be&s;eech you to con&s;ider, whether tho&s;e, who have been
in the &s;ame place, which I now occupy, have not freely
given warrants for commitment; and yet no doubt been
entertained, nor any complaint made by the &s;ubject<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">State Trials, vol. vii. p. 189, 190, Ru&s;h. vol. i. p. 553.</NOTE>.&endq;</P>
<P>UPON this &s;peech there aro&s;e a great debate in the hou&s;e.
Many rea&s;ons were a-new urged on both &s;ides: But, Sir
Thomas Wentworth clo&s;ed the debate, by &s;aying, &startq;That
never hou&s;e of parliament, &s;o far as regarded them&s;elves,
tru&s;ted more than the pre&s;ent to the goodne&s;s of their
King: But we are ambitious,&endq; &s;aid he, &startq;that his Ma|je&s;ty's
goodne&s;s may remain to po&s;terity, and we are ac|countable
for a public tru&s;t. There hath been a public
violation of the laws by the King's mini&s;ters; and nothing
can &s;atisfy the nation but a public reparation. Our de&s;ire
to vindicate the &s;ubjects right by bill, will carry us no
farther than what is contained in former laws, with &s;ome
mode&s;t provi&s;ion for in&s;truction, performance, and execu|tion<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Ru&s;h vol. i. 554.</NOTE>.&endq;
This contained &s;o much the &s;entiments of the
hou&s;e, that it was univer&s;ally acquie&s;ced in.</P>
<P>THE King, however, was not di&s;couraged. By another
me&s;&s;age, he attempted to divert the commons from their pur|po&s;e.
He there acknowleged pa&s;t errors, and promi&s;ed, that,
hereafter, there &s;hould be no ju&s;t cau&s;e of complaint. And
<PB N="189" REF="227">
he added, &startq;That the affairs of the kingdom pre&s;s him &s;o,
that he could not continue the &s;e&s;&s;ion above a week or two
longer: And if the hou&s;e be not ready, by that time,
to do what is fit for them&s;elves it &s;hall be their own
fault<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">State Trials vol. vii. p. 193.</NOTE>.&endq;
On a &s;ub&s;equent occa&s;ion, he a&s;ked them,
&startq;Why demand explanations, if you doubt not the per|formance
of the &s;tatutes, according to their true mean|ing.
Explanations will hazard an encroachment upon
the prerogative. And it may well be &s;aid, What need a
new law to confirm an old, if you repo&s;e confidence in
the declarations, which his Maje&s;ty made to both
hou&s;es<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Ibid. vol. vii. p. 190. Ru&s;h. vol. i. p. 556.</NOTE>.&endq; The truth is, the great charter and the old
&s;tatutes were &s;ufficiently clear in favour of liberty; But
as all Kings of England, had ever, in ca&s;es of nece&s;&s;ity or
expediency, been accu&s;tomed, at intervals, to elude them;
and as Charles, in a complication of in&s;tances, had lately
violated them; the commons judged it requi&s;ite to enact a
new law, which might not be eluded or violated, by any
interpretation, con&s;truction, or contrary precedent. Nor
was it &s;ufficient, they thought, that the King promi&s;ed to re|turn
into the way of his predece&s;&s;ors. His predece&s;&s;ors, in
all times, had enjoyed, at lea&s;t, exercised, too much di&s;|cretionary
power; and by his recent abu&s;e of it, the whole world
had rea&s;on to &s;ee the nece&s;&s;ity of intirely retrenching
it.</P>
<P>SIR Edward Coke urged on this occa&s;ion, with the ap|probation
of the whole hou&s;e, &startq;Was it ever know, that
general words were a &s;ufficient &s;ati&s;faction for particular
grievances? Was ever a verbal declaration of the King
the world of the &s;overeign? When grievances are com|plained
of, the parliament is to redre&s;s them. Did ever
the parliament rely on me&s;&s;ages? They have ever put up
petitions of their grievances, and the King has ever
an&s;wered them. The Kings me&s;&s;age is very gracious;
<PB N="190" REF="228">
but, what is the law of the realm? that is the que&s;tion.
I have no diffidence of his Maje&s;ty; but the King mu&s;t
&s;peak by record, and in particulars. Did you ever
know the King's me&s;&s;age come into a bill of &s;ub&s;idies?
All &s;ucceeding kings will &s;ay, <HI>Ye mu&s;t tru&s;t me as you did
my predece&s;&s;or, and ye mu&s;t have the &s;ame confidence in
my me&s;&s;ages.</HI> But me&s;&s;ages of love never come into
a parliament. Let us put up a petition of right: Not
that I di&s;tru&s;t the King; but that I cannot give tru&s;t ex|cept
in a parliamentary way<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">State Trials, vol. vii. p. 197. Ru&s;h. vol. i. p. 558.</NOTE>.&endq;</P>
<P>THE King &s;till per&s;evered in his endeavours to elude the
petition. He &s;ent a letter to the hou&s;e of lords, in which
he went &s;o far as to make a particular declaration, &startq;That
neither he nor his privy-council &s;hall or will, at any time
hereafter, commit or command to pri&s;on, or otherwi&s;e
re&s;train, any man for not lending money, or for any other
cau&s;e, which, in his con&s;cience, he thought not to con|cern
the public good, and the &s;afety of King and people.&endq;
And he farther declared, &startq;That he never would be guilty
of &s;o ba&s;e an action as to pretend any cau&s;e, of who&s;e
truth he was not fully &s;atisfied<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">State Trials, vol. vii. p. 198. Ru&s;h. vol. i. p. 560. Parlia. Hi&s;t. vol. viii. p. III.</NOTE>.&endq; But this promi&s;e,
though inforced to the commons by the recommendation of
the upper hou&s;e, made no more impre&s;&s;ion than all the
former me&s;&s;ages.</P>
<P>AMONG the other eva&s;ions of the King, we may reckon
the propo&s;al of the hou&s;e of peers, to &s;ubjoin, to the in|tended
petition of right, the following clau&s;e, &startq;We hum|bly
pre&s;ent this petition to your Maje&s;ty, not only with a
care of pre&s;erving our own liberties, but with due re|gard

<P>THESE ob&s;tacles, therefore, being &s;urmounted, the pe|tition

<P>IV. And, in the eight and twentieth year of the reign King Edward III. it was declared and enacted, by authority of parliament, That no man, of what e&s;tate or condition that he be, &s;hould be put out of his land or tenements, nor taken, nor impri&s;oned, nor di&s;herited, nor put to death, without being brought to an&s;wer by due proce&s;s of law.</P>

material alteration; and nothing but the royal a&s;&s;ent was
wanting to give it the force of a law. The King accord|ingly
came to the hou&s;e of peers; &s;ent for the commons;
and, being &s;eated in his chair of &s;tate, the petition was
read to him. Great was now the a&s;toni&s;hment of all men,
<PB N="194" REF="232">
when, in&s;tead of the u&s;ual conci&s;e, and clear form, by
which a bill is either confirmed or rejected, Charles &s;aid,
in an&s;wer to the petition, &startq;The King willeth, that right
be done according to the laws and cu&s;toms of the realm,
and that the &s;tatutes be put into execution; that his &s;ub|jects
may have no cau&s;e to complain of any wrong or
oppre&s;&s;ion, contrary to their ju&s;t rights and liberties, to
the pre&s;ervation whereof he holds him&s;elf in con&s;cience
as much obliged as of his own prerogative<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">State Trials, vol. vii. p. 212. Rush. vol. i. p. 590.</NOTE>.&endq;</P>
<P>IT is &s;urprizing, that Charles, who had &s;een &s;o many
in&s;tances of the jealou&s;y of the commons, who had him&s;$
&s;o much rouzed that jealou&s;y by his frequent eva$
me&s;&s;ages during this &s;e&s;&s;ion, could imagine, that they would
remain &s;atisfied with an an&s;wer &s;o vague and undetermined.
It was evident, that the unu&s;ual form alone of the an&s;wer
mu&s;t excite their attention; that the di&s;appointment mu&s;t
inflame their anger; and that therefore it was nece&s;&s;ary,
the petition &s;eemed to bear hard on royal, prerogative,
come early to &s;ome fixed re&s;olution, either gracefully to
comply with it, or courageou&s;ly to reject it.</P>
<P>IT happened, as might have been fore&s;een. The com|mons
returned in very ill humour. U&s;ually, when in that
di&s;po&s;ition, their zeal and jealou&s;y for religion, and their
enmity again&s;t the unfortunate catholics, ran extremely
high. But they had already, in the beginning of the &s;e&s;&s;ion,
pre&s;ented to the King their petition of religion, and had
received a &s;atis&s;actory an&s;wer; though they expected, that
the execution of the laws again&s;t papi&s;ts would, for the fu|ture,
be no more exact and rigid, than they had hitherto
found it. To give vent to their pre&s;ent indignation, they
fell, with their utmo&s;t force, on Dr. Manwaring.</P>

Charles, than his open encouragement and avowal of &s;uch
general principles, as were altogether incompatible with a
limited government. Manwaring had preached a &s;ermon,
which the commons found, upon inquiry, to be printed by
&s;pecial command from the King<NOTE N="w" PLACE="foot">Parl. Hi&s;t. vol. viii. p. 206.</NOTE>; and, when this &s;ermon
was looked into, it contained doctrines &s;ubver&s;ive of all
civil liberty. It taught, That, though property was com|monly
lodged in the &s;ubject, yet, whenever any exigency
required &s;upply, all property was transferred to the King;
that the con&s;ent of parliament was not requi&s;ite for the im|po&s;ition
of taxes; and that the divine laws required com|pliance
with every demand, however irregular, which the
prince &s;hould make upon his &s;ubjects<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Ru&s;h. vol. i. p. 585, 594. Parl. Hi&s;t. vol. viii. p. 168, 169, 170, &amp;c. Welwood, p. 44.</NOTE>. For the&s;e doc|trines,
the commons impeached Manwaring before the
peers. The &s;entence, pronounced upon him, was, That
he &s;hould be impri&s;oned during the plea&s;ure of the hou&s;e,
be fined a thou&s;and pounds to the King, make &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion
and acknowledgement for his offence, be &s;u&s;pended during
three years, be incapable of holding any eccle&s;ia&s;tical dig|nity
or &s;ecular office, and that his book be called in and
burnt<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Ru&s;h. vol. i, p. 65. Parl. Hi&s;t. vol. viii. p. 212.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IT may be worth notice, that, no &s;ooner was the &s;e&s;&s;ion
ended, than this man, &s;o ju&s;tly di&s;agreeable to both hou&s;es,
received a pardon, and was promoted to a living of con&s;i|derable
value<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Ru&s;h. vol. i. p. 635. Whitlocke, p. II.</NOTE> Some years after, he was rai&s;ed to the &s;ee
of St. A&s;aph. If the republican &s;pirit of the commons in|crea&s;ed,
beyond all rea&s;onable bounds, the monarchical
&s;pirit of the court, this latter, carried to &s;o high a pitch,
tended &s;till farther to augment the former. And thus ex|tremes
were every where affected, and the ju&s;t medium was
gradually de&s;erted by all men.</P>
<P>FROM Manwaring, the hou&s;e of commons proceeded to
cen&s;ure the conduct of Buckingham, who&s;e name, hitherto,
<PB N="196" REF="237">
they had cautiou&s;ly forborne to mention<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Ru&s;h. vol. i. p. 607.</NOTE>. In vain did the
King &s;end them a me&s;&s;age, in which he told them, that the
&s;e&s;&s;ion was drawing near a conclu&s;ion; and de&s;ired, that
they would not enter upon new bu&s;ine&s;s, nor ca&s;t any a&s;|per&s;ions
on his government and mini&s;try<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Ibid. vol. i. p. 605.</NOTE>. Though the
court endeavoured to explain and &s;often this me&s;&s;age by a
&s;ub&s;equent me&s;&s;age<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Ibid. vol. i. 610. Parl. Hi&s;t. vol. viii. p. 197.</NOTE>; as Charles was apt ha&s;tily to correct
any ha&s;ty &s;tep, which he had taken; it &s;erved rather to in|flame
than appea&s;e the commons: As if the method of their
proceeding had here been pre&s;cribed to them. It was fore|&s;een:,
that a great tempe&s;t was ready to bur&s;t on the Duke;
and in order to divert it, the King thought proper, upon a
joint application of the lords and commons<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Ru&s;h. vol. i. p. 613. Journ. 7 June, 1628. Parl. Hi&s;t. vol. viii. p. 201.</NOTE>, to endeavour
the giving them &s;atisfaction, with regard to the petition of
right. He came, therefore, to the hou&s;e of peers, and
pronouncing the u&s;ual form of words, <HI>Let it be law as is
de&s;ired,</HI> gave full &s;anction and authority to the petition.
The acclamations, with which the hou&s;e refounded, and
the univer&s;al joy diffu&s;ed over the nation, showed how
much this petition had been the object of all mens vows
and expectations<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Ru&s;hworth, vol. i. p. 613.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IT may be affirmed, without any exaggeration, that the
King's a&s;&s;ent to the petition of right produced &s;uch a change
in the government, as was almo&s;t equivalent to a revolu|tion;
and by circum&s;cribing, in &s;o many articles, the royal
prerogative, gave additional &s;ecurity to the liberties of the
&s;ubject. Yet were the commons far from being &s;atisfied
with this important conce&s;&s;ion. Their ill humour had been
&s;o much irritated by the King's frequent eva&s;ions and de|lays,
that it could not be pre&s;ently appea&s;ed by an a&s;&s;ent,
which he allowed to be &s;o ungracefully extorted from him.
Perhaps too, the popular leaders, implacable and artful,
<PB N="197" REF="238">
&s;aw the opportunity favourable; and turning again&s;t the
King tho&s;e very weapons, with which he had furni&s;hed
them, re&s;olved to pur&s;ue the victory. The bill, however,
for five &s;ub&s;idies, which had been formerly voted, immedi|ately
pa&s;&s;ed the hou&s;e; becau&s;e the granting that &s;upply
was, in a manner, tacitly contracted for, upon the royal
a&s;&s;ent to the petition; and had faith been here violated, no
farther confidence could have &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between King and
parliament. Having made this conce&s;&s;ion, the commons
continued to carry their &s;crutiny into every part of govern|ment.
In &s;ome particulars, their indu&s;try was laudable; in
&s;ome, it was liable to cen&s;ure.</P>
<P>A LITTLE after writs were i&s;&s;ued for &s;ummoning this par|liament,
a commi&s;&s;ion had been granted to Sir Thomas
Coventry, lord keeper, the Earl of Marlborough, high
trea&s;urer, the Earl of Manche&s;ter, lord pre&s;ident
of the council, the Earl of Worce&s;ter, privy &s;eal, the Duke of
Buckingham, high admiral, and all the con&s;iderable offi|cers
of the crown, in the whole thirty-three. By this com|mi&s;&s;ion,
which, from the number of per&s;ons named in it,
could be no &s;ecret, the coimmi&s;&s;ioners were empowered to
meet, and to concert among them&s;elves the methods of le|vying
money by impo&s;itions, or otherwi&s;e; <HI>Where form and
circum&s;tance,</HI> as expre&s;&s;ed in the commi&s;&s;ion, <HI>mu&s;t be di&s;|pen&s;ed

In other words, this was a &s;cheme for finding expedients,
which might rai&s;e the prerogative to the greate&s;t height,
and render parliaments intirely u&s;ele&s;s. The commons ap|plied
for cancelling the commi&s;&s;ion<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Journ. $3 june, 1628.</NOTE>; and were, no doubt,
de&s;irous, that all the world &s;hould conclude the King's
principles to be extremely arbitrary, and &s;hould ob&s;erve
what little regard he was di&s;po&s;ed to pay to the liberties and
privileges of his people.</P>
<P><PB N="198" REF="239">
A COMMISSION had likewi&s;e been granted, and &s;ome
money remitted, in order to rai&s;e a thou&s;and German hor&s;e,
and tran&s;port them into England. The&s;e were &s;uppo&s;ed to be
levied, in order to &s;upport the projected impo&s;itions or ex|erci&s;es;
though the number &s;eems very in&s;ufficient for &s;uch
a purpo&s;e<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Ru&s;h. vol. i. p. 612.</NOTE>. The hou&s;e took notice of this de&s;ign in very &s;e|vere
terms: And no mea&s;ure, &s;urely, could be projected more
generally odious to the whole nation. It mu&s;t, however,
be confe&s;&s;ed, that the King was &s;o far right, that he had,
now at la&s;t, fallen on the only effectual method of &s;upport|ing
his prerogative. But at the &s;ame time, he &s;hould have
been &s;en&s;ible, that, till provided of a &s;ufficient military
force, all his attempts, in oppo&s;ition to the ri&s;ing &s;pirit
of the nation, mu&s;t, in the end, prove intirely fruitle&s;s; and
that the higher he &s;crewed up the &s;prings of government,
while he had &s;o little real power to retain them in that forced
&s;ituation, with more fatal violence mu&s;t they fly out, when
any accident occurred to re&s;tore them to their natural ac|tion.</P>
<P>THE commons next re&s;umed their cen&s;ure of Bucking|ham's
conduct and behaviour, again&s;t whom they were im|placable.
They agreed to pre&s;ent a remon&s;trance to the
King, in which they recapitulated all national grievances
and misfortunes, and omitted no circum&s;tance, which
could render the whole admini&s;tration de&s;picable and odious.
The compo&s;itions with catholics, they &s;aid, amounted to
no le&s;s than a toleration, hateful to God, full of di&s;honour
and di&s;profit to his Maje&s;ty, and of extreme &s;candal and
grief to his good people: They took notice of the viola|tions
of liberty above-mentioned, again&s;t which the peti|tion
of right &s;eems to have provided a &s;ufficient remedy:
They mentioned the decay of trade, the un&s;ucce&s;sful expe|ditions
to Cadiz and the i&s;le of Rh&eacute;, the encouragement
given to Arminians, the commi&s;&s;ion for tran&s;porting Ger|man

hor&s;e, that for levying new impo&s;itions; and all the&s;e
grievances they a&s;cribed &s;olely to the ill conduct of the Duke
of Buckingham<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Ru&s;h. vol. i. p. 619. Parl. Hi&s;t. vol. viii, p. 219, 220, &amp;c.</NOTE>. This remon&s;trance was, perhaps, not
the le&s;s provoking to Charles, that, joined to the extreme
acrimony of the &s;ubject, there were pre&s;erved in it, as in
mo&s;t of the prote&s;tations and remon&s;trances of that age, an
affected civility and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion in the language.</P>
<P>IT was not without good grounds, that the commons
were &s;o fierce and a&s;&s;uming. Though they had already
granted the King the &s;upply of five &s;ub&s;idies, they &s;till re|tained
a pledge in their hands, which, they thought, en|&s;ured
them &s;ucce&s;s in all their applications, Tonnage and
poundage had not yet been granted by parliament; and the
commons had artfully,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Prorogation, 26 of June.</NOTE> this &s;e&s;&s;ion, concealed their inten|tion
of invading that branch of revenue, till the royal a&s;|&s;ent
had been obtained to the petition of right, which they
ju&s;tly e&s;teemed of &s;uch importance. They then openly a&s;|&s;erted,
that the levying tonnage and poundage without con|&s;ent
of parliament, was a palpable violation of all the an|tient
liberties of the people, and an open infringement of
the petition of right, &s;o lately granted<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Ru&s;h. vol. i. p. 628. Journ. 18, 20 June, 1628.</NOTE>. The King, in
order to prevent the fini&s;hing and pre&s;enting this remon|&s;trance,
came &s;uddenly to the parliament, and ended this
&s;e&s;&s;ion by a prorogation<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Journ. 26 June, 1628.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BEING freed, for &s;ome time, from the embarra&s;&s;ment of
this a&s;&s;embly, Charles began to look towards foreign wars,
where all his efforts were equally un&s;ucce&s;sful, as in his do|me&s;tic
government. The Earl of Denbigh, brother-in-law
to Buckingham, was di&s;patched to the relief of Rochelle,
now clo&s;ely be&s;ieged by land, and threatened with a
blockade by &s;ea: But he returned without effecting any
<PB N="200" REF="241">
thing; and having declined to attack the enemy's fleet, he
brought on the Engli&s;h arms the imputation, either of coward|ice
or ill conduct. In order to repair this di&s;honour, the Duke
went to Port&s;mouth, where he had prepared a con&s;iderable
fleet and army, on which all the &s;ub&s;idies, given by par|liament,
had been expended. This &s;upply had very much
di&s;appointed the King's expectations. The &s;ame mutinous
&s;pirit, which prevailed in the hou&s;e of commons, had dif|fu&s;ed
it&s;elf over the nation; and the commi&s;&s;ioners, ap|pointed
for making the a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ments, had connived at all
frauds, which might dimini&s;h the &s;upply, and reduce the
crown to &s;till greater nece&s;&s;ities. This national di&s;content,
communicated to a de&s;perate enthu&s;ia&s;t, soon broke out in an
event, which may be con&s;idered as very remarkable.</P>
<P>THERE was one Felton, of a good family, but of an
ardent, melancholic temper, who had &s;erved under the Duke,
in the &s;tation of lieutenant. His captain being killed in
the retreat at the isle of Rh$, Felton had &s;ollicited for the
company; and when di&s;appointed, he threw up his com|mi&s;&s;ion,
and retired in di&s;content from the army. While
private re&s;entment was boiling in his &s;ullen, un&s;ociable mind,
he heard the nation refound with complaints again&s;t the
Duke; and he met with the remon&s;trance of the commons,
in which his enemy was repre&s;ented as the cau&s;e of every
national grievance, and as the great enemy of the public.
Religious fanatici&s;m farther inflamed the&s; vindictive reflec|tions;
and he fancied, that he &s;hould do heaven acceptable
&s;ervice, if, at one blow, he di&s;patched this dangerous foe
to religion and to his country<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">May's Hist. of the Parliam, p. 10.</NOTE>. Full of the&s;e dark views,
he &s;ecretly arrived at Port&s;mouth, at the &s;ame time with
the Duke, and watched for an opportunity of effecting his
bloody purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>BUCKINGHAM had been engaged in conver&s;ation with
Soubize and other French gentlemen;<NOTE PLACE="marg">23d of Aug.</NOTE> and a difference of
<PB N="201" REF="242">
&s;entiment&s; having ari&s;en, the di&s;pute, though conducted
with temper and decency, had produced &s;ome of tho&s;e ve|hement
ge&s;ticulations and lively exertions of voice, in which
that nation, more than the Engli&s;h, are apt to indulge
them&s;elve&s;. The conver&s;ation being fini&s;hed, the Duke
drew toward&s; the door; and in that pa&s;&s;age, turning him|&s;elf
to &s;peak to Sir Thoma&s; Fryar, a colonel in the army,
he was,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Death of Bucking|ham.</NOTE> on the &s;udden, over Sir Thomas's &s;houlder, &s;truck
upon the brea&s;t with a knife. Without uttering other
word&s; than <HI>The villain has killed me;</HI> in the &s;ame moment,
pulling out the knife, he breathed his la&s;t.</P>
<P>No man had &s;een the blow, nor the per&s;on who gave it;
but in the confu&s;ion, every one made hi&s; own conjecture;
and all agreed, that the murder had been committed by the
French gentlemen, who&s;e angry tone of voice had been
heard, while their word&s; had not been under&s;tood, by the
by&s;tanders. In the hurry of revenge, they had in&s;tantly
been put to death, had they not been &s;aved by &s;ome of
more temper and judgment, who, though they had the
&s;ame opinion of their guilt, thought proper to re&s;erve them
for a judicial trial and examination.</P>
<P>NEAR the door, there was found a hat, in the in&s;ide of
which was &s;owed a paper, containing four or five lines of
that remon&s;trance of the common&s;, which declared Bucking|ham
an enemy to the kingdom; and under the&s;e lines wa&s; a
&s;hort ejaculation or attempt towards a prayer. It was ea&s;ily
concluded that thi&s; hat belonged to the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in: But the dif|ficulty
&s;till remained, <HI>Who that per&s;on &s;hould be?</HI> For the
writing di&s;covered not the. name; and whoever he was, it
was natural to believe, that he had already fled far enough,
not to be found without a hat.</P>
<P>IN this hurry, a man without a hat was &s;een walking
very compo&s;edly before the door. One crying out, <HI>Here
is the fellow, who killed the Duke;</HI> every body ran to a&s;k,
<HI>Which is he?</HI> The man very &s;edately an&s;wered, <HI>I am he.</HI>
<PB N="202" REF="243">
The more furiou&s; immediately ru&s;hed upon him with draw$
&s;words: Others, more deliberate, defended and protected
him: He him&s;elf, with open arms, very calmly and chear|fully
expo&s;ed hi&s; brea&s;t to the &s;word&s; of the mo&s;t enraged;
being willing to fall a &s;udden &s;acrifice to their anger, rather
than be re&s;erved for that public ju&s;tice, which he knew
mu&s;t be executed upon him.</P>
<P>HE was now known to be that Felton, who had &s;erved
in the army. Being carried into a private room, it wa&s;
thought proper &s;o far to di&s;&s;emble a&s; to tell him, that Buck|ingham
wa&s; only grievou&s;ly wounded, but not without
hope&s; of recovery. Felton &s;miled, and told them, that
the Duke, he knew full well, had received a blow, which
had terminated all their hopes. When a&s;ked, at who&s;e in&s;ti|gation
he had performed that horrid deed? He an&s;wered,
that they needed not to trouble them&s;elve&s; in that inquiry;
that no man living had credit enough with him to have di&s;|po&s;ed
him to &s;uch an action; that he had not even entru&s;t|ed
hi&s; purpo&s;e to any one; that the re&s;olution proceeded
only from him&s;elf and the impul&s;e of hi&s; own con&s;cience;
and that his motives would appear, if his hat was found;
For that, believing he would peri&s;h in the attempt, he had
there taken care to explain them<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Clarendon, vol. i. p. 27, 28.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>WHEN the King was informed of this a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination, he
received the news in public with an unmoved and undi&s;|turbed
countenance; and the courtiers, who &s;tudied his
looks, concluded, that &s;ecretly he was not di&s;plea&s;ed to be
rid of a mini&s;ter, &s;o generally odious to the nation<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Warwick, p. 34.</NOTE>. But
Charles's command of him&s;elf proceeded intirely from the
gravity and compo&s;ure of hi&s; temper. He was &s;till, as much
as ever, attached to his favoruite; and, during his whole
life, he retained an affection for Buckingham's friends, and
a prejudice again&s;t hi&s; enemie&s;. He urged too, that Felton
<PB N="203" REF="244">
&s;hould be put to the que&s;tion, in order to extort from him
a di&s;covery of his accomplices: But the judges declared,
that, though that practice had been formerly very u&s;ual, it
was altogether illegal. So much more exact rea&s;oners, with
regard to law, had they become, from the jealous &s;cruple&s;
of the hou&s;e of commons.</P>
<P>MEAN while the di&s;tre&s;s of Rochelle had ri&s;en to the ut|mo&s;t
extremity. That va&s;t genius of Richlieu, which
made him form the greate&s;t enterprizes, led him to attempt
their execution,<NOTE PLACE="marg">18th of Oct.</NOTE> by means equally great and extraordinary.
In order to deprive Rochelle of all &s;uccour, he had dared
to project the throwing cro&s;s the harbour a mole of a mile's
extent in that boi&s;terous ocean; and having executed his
project, he now held the town clo&s;ely blockaded on all &s;ides.
The inhabitants, though pre&s;&s;ed with the greate&s;t rigours of
famine, &s;till refu&s;ed to &s;ubmit; being &s;upported, partly by
the lectures of their zealous preachers, partly by the daily
hopes of a&s;&s;i&s;tance from England. After Buckingham's death,
the command of the fleet and army was conferred on
the Earl of Linde&s;ey; who arriving before Rochelle, made
&s;ome attempts to break through the mole, and force his
way into the town: But by the delays of the Engli&s;h, that
work was now fully fini&s;hed and fortified; and the Ro|chellers,
finding their la&s;t hopes to fail them, were reduced
to &s;urrender at di&s;cretion, even in &s;ight of the Engli&s;h
admiral. Of fifteen thou&s;and per&s;ons, who had been &s;hut up
in the town, four thou&s;and alone &s;urvived the fatigues and
famine, which they had undergone<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Ru&s;h. vol. i. p. 636.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THIS was the fir&s;t nece&s;&s;ary &s;tep towards the pro&s;perity
of France. Foreign enemies, as well as dome&s;tic factions,
being deprived of this re&s;ource, that kingdom began now
to &s;hine forth in it&s; full &s;plendor. By a &s;teddy pro&s;ecution

to the lawful authority of the &s;overeign. The vic|tory,
however, over the hugonots was, at fir&s;t, pu&s;hed by
the French King with great moderation. A toleration was
&s;till continued to them; the only avowed and open tole|ration,

Montague, who had been cen&s;ured for moderation to the

all the copies of the petition of right, which were di&s;per&s;ed,
had, by the King's orders, annexed to them the fir&s;t an|&s;wer,
which had given &s;o little &s;ati&s;faction to the commons<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">State Trials, vol. vii. p. 216. Ru&s;h. vol. i. p. 643.</NOTE>.
An expedient of Charles, by which he endeavoured to
per&s;uade the people, that he had nowi&s;e receded from his
former claims and preten&s;ions, particularly with regard to

So apt were they on their part, to &s;tretch the
petition into &s;uch con&s;equence&s; as might deprive the crown
of powers, which, from immemorial cu&s;tom, were &s;up|po&s;ed
inherent in it.</P>
<P>BUT the great article,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tonnage and pound|age.</NOTE> on which the hou&s;e of commons
broke with the King, and which finally created in Charle&s; a
di&s;gu&s;t to all parliaments, was their claim with regard to
tonnage and poundage. On this occa&s;ion, therefore, it is
nece&s;&s;ary to give an account of the controver&s;y.</P>
<P>THE duty of tonnage and poundage, in more antient
times, had been commonly a temporary grant of the par|liament;
but it had been conferred on Henry V. and all the
&s;ucceeding prince&s;, during life, in order to enable them to
maintain a naval force for the protection of the kingdom.
The nece&s;&s;ity of levying thi&s; duty had been &s;o apparent,
that each King had ever claimed it from the moment of his
acce&s;&s;ion; and the fir&s;t parliament of each reign had ever
by vote conferred on the prince what they found him al|ready
in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of. Agreeable to the inaccurate genius
of the old con&s;titution, thi&s; abu&s;e, however con&s;iderable,
had never been perceived nor remedied; though nothing
could have been ea&s;ier than for the parliament to have pre|vented
it<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Parl. Hi&s;t. vol. viii. p. 339, 340.</NOTE>. By granting this duty to each prince, during his
own life, and, for a year after his decea&s;e, to the &s;ucce&s;&s;or,
all his inconveniences had been obviated; and yet the duty
had never, for a moment, been levied without proper au|thority.
But contrivances of that nature were not thought
of during those rude ages: And as &s;o complicated and jealous
a government as the Engli&s;h cannot &s;ub&s;i&s;t without many
&s;uch refinements; it is ea&s;y to &s;ee, how favourable every
inaccuracy mu&s;t formerly have proved to royal autho|rity,
which, on all emergencies, was obliged to &s;upply,
<PB N="206" REF="248">
by di&s;cretionary power, the great deficiency of the laws.</P>
<P>THE parliament did not grant the duties of tonnage and
poundage to Henry VIII. till the &s;ixth year of his reign:
Yet this prince, who had not then rai&s;ed his power to its
greate&s;t height, continued, during that whole time, to levy
the&s;e duties: The parliament, in their very grant, blame
the merchants, who had neglected to make payment to the
crown; and though &s;ome expre&s;&s;ions of that bill &s;eem am|biguous
and equivocal, they employ the plaine&s;t terms in
calling tonnage and poundage the King's due, even before
they were conferred on him by parliamentary authority<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">6 Henry VIII. cap. 14.</NOTE>.
Four reigns, and above a whole century, were &s;ince elap&s;ed;
and the&s;e duties had &s;till been levied before they were
voted by parliament. So long had this inaccuracy conti|nued,
without being remarked or corrected!</P>
<P>DURING that &s;hort interval, which elap&s;ed, between
Charles's acce&s;&s;ion and his fir&s;t parliament, he had followed
the example of his predece&s;&s;ors; and no fault was found
with his conduct in this particular. But what was mo&s;t
remarkable in the proceedings of that hou&s;e of commons,
and what proved beyond controver&s;y, that they had &s;eri|ou&s;ly
formed a plan for reducing their prince to dependence,
was, that, in&s;tead of granting this &s;upply during the King's
life, as it had been enjoyed by all his immediate prede|ce&s;&s;ors,
they voted it only for a year; and, after that &s;hould
be elap&s;ed, re&s;erved to them&s;elves the power of renewing or
refu&s;ing the &s;ame conce&s;&s;ion<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Journ. 5 July, 1625.</NOTE>. But the hou&s;e of peers, who
&s;aw that this duty was now become more nece&s;&s;ary than
ever to &s;upply the growing nece&s;&s;ities of the crown, and
who did not approve of this encroaching &s;pirit of the com|mons,
rejected the bill; and the di&s;&s;olution of that par|liament
followed &s;o &s;oon after, that no attempt &s;eems to
<PB N="207" REF="249">
have been made for the obtaining tonnage and poundage in
any other form<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">The rea&s;on a&s;&s;igned by Sir Philip Warwick, p. 2. for this unu&s;ual mea|&s;ure of the commons, is, that they intended to deprive the crown of the pre|rogative, which it had a&s;&s;umed, of varying the rates of the impo&s;itions, and at the &s;ame time were re&s;olved to cut off the new rates laid on by James. The&s;e were con&s;iderable diminutions both of revenue and prerogative; and whether they would have there &s;topt, con&s;idering their pre&s;ent di&s;po&s;ition, may appear &s;omewhat uncertain. The King, it &s;eems, and the lords, were re&s;olved not to tru&s;t them; nor to render a revenue once precarious, which perhaps they might never afterwards be able to get re-e&s;tabli&s;hed on the old footing.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>CHARLES, mean while, continued &s;till to levy the&s;e du|ties
by his own authority; and the nation was &s;o accu&s;tomed
to this exertion of royal power, that no &s;cruple was at fir&s;t
entertained of &s;ubmitting to it. But the &s;ucceeding parlia|ment
excited doubts in every one. The commons made
there &s;ome &s;teps towards declaring it illegal to levy tonnage
and poundage without con&s;ent of parliament, and they openly
&s;howed their intention of employing this engine, in order
to extort from the crown conce&s;&s;ions of the mo&s;t important
nature. But Charles was not yet &s;ufficiently tamed to com|pliance;
and the abrupt di&s;&s;olution of that parliament, as
above related, put an end, for the time, to their farther
preten&s;ions.</P>
<P>THE following interval, between the &s;econd and third
parliament, was di&s;tingui&s;hed by &s;o many exertions of pre|rogative,
that men had little lei&s;ure to attend to this affair of
tonnage and poundage, where the abu&s;e of power in the
crown might &s;eem to be of a more di&s;putable nature. But
after the commons, during the precedent &s;e&s;&s;ion, had reme|died
all the&s;e grievances by means of their petition of right,
which was become &s;o nece&s;&s;ary; they afterwards proceeded
to take this matter into con&s;ideration, and they &s;howed the
&s;ame intention, as formerly, of exacting, in return for the
grant of this revenue, very large compliances on the part
of the crown. Their &s;udden prorogation prevented them
from bringing their preten&s;ions to a full conclu&s;ion.</P>
<P><PB N="208" REF="250">
WHEN Charles opened this &s;e&s;&s;ion, he had fore&s;een that
the &s;ame controver&s;y would ari&s;e; and he therefore took
care, very early, among many mild and reconciling expre&s;|&s;ions,
to inform the commons, &startq;That he had not taken
the&s;e duties as appertaining to his hereditary prerogative;
but that it ever was, and &s;till is, his meaning to enjoy
them as a gift of his people: And that, if he had hitherto
levied tonnage and poundage, he pretended to ju&s;tify
him&s;elf only by the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;o doing, not by any
right which he a&s;&s;umed<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Ru&s;hworth, vol. i. p. 644. Parl. Hi&s;t. vol. viii. p. 256, 346.</NOTE>.&endq; This conce&s;&s;ion, which pro|bably
proceeded from the King's moderate temper, now
freed from the impul&s;e of Buckingham's violent coun&s;els,
might have &s;atisfied the commons, had they entertained no
other view than that of a&s;certaining their own rights and
privileges. But they carried their preten&s;ions much higher.
They in&s;i&s;ted, as a nece&s;&s;ary preliminary, that the King &s;hould
once intirely de&s;i&s;t from levying the&s;e duties; after which
they were to take into con&s;ideration, how far they would
re&s;tore him to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a revenue, of which he had
clearly dive&s;ted him&s;elf. But be&s;ides that this extreme
rigour had never been exerci&s;ed towards any of his prede|ce&s;&s;ors,
and many obvious prejudices mu&s;t follow the in|termi&s;&s;ion
of the cu&s;toms; there were other rea&s;ons, which
deterred Charles from complying with &s;o hard a condition.
It was probable, that the commons might renew their for|mer
project of making this revenue only temporary, and
thereby reducing their prince to perpetual dependence; they
certainly would cut off all the new impo&s;itions which Mary
and Elizabeth, but e&s;pecially James, had levied, and which
formed no de&s;picable part of the public revenue; and they
openly declared, that they had, at pre&s;ent, many important
preten&s;ions, chiefly with regard to religion; and if compli|ance
was refu&s;ed, no &s;upply mu&s;t be expected from the commons.</P>
<P><PB N="209" REF="251">
IT is ea&s;y to &s;ee in what an inextricable labyrinth Charles
was now involved. By his own conce&s;&s;ions, by the general
principles of the Engli&s;h government, and by the form of
every bill which had granted this duty, tonnage and poundage
was derived entirely from the free gift of the people; and,
by con&s;equence, might be withdrawn at their plea&s;ure. If
unrea&s;onable in their refu&s;al, they &s;till refu&s;ed nothing but
what was their own. If public nece&s;&s;ity required this &s;up|ply,
it al&s;o required the King's compliance with tho&s;e con|ditions
which were the price of obtaining it. Tho' the mo|tive
of granting it had been the enabling the King to guard
the &s;eas; it did not follow, that, becau&s;e he guarded the &s;eas,
he was therefore entitled to this revenue, without any farther
formality: &s;ince the people had &s;till re&s;erved to them&s;elves
the right of judging how far that &s;ervice merited &s;uch a
&s;upply. But Charles, notwith&s;tanding his public declara|tion,
was far from a&s;&s;enting to this conclu&s;ion, in its full ex|tent.
The plain con&s;equence, he &s;aw, of all the&s;e rigours,
and refinements, and inferences, was, that he, without any
public nece&s;&s;ity, and without any default of his own, mu&s;t
of a &s;udden, even from his acce&s;&s;ion, become a magi&s;trate
of a very different nature from any of his predece&s;&s;ors, and
mu&s;t fall into a total dependence on &s;ubjects, over whom
former kings, e&s;pecially tho&s;e immediately preceding, had
exerci&s;ed an authority almo&s;t unlimited. Entangled in a
chain of con&s;equences, which he could not ea&s;ily break,
he was inclined to go higher, and rather deny the fir&s;t prin|ciple,
than admit of conclu&s;ions which to him appeared &s;o
ab&s;urd and unrea&s;onable. Agreeable to the ideas hitherto
entertained both by natives and foreigners, the monarch he
e&s;teemed the e&s;&s;ence and &s;oul of the Engli&s;h government;
and whatever other power pretended to annihilate or even
abridge the royal authority, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily, he thought,
either in its nature or exerci&s;e, be deemed no better than an
u&s;urpation. Willing to pre&s;erve the antient harmony of
<PB N="210" REF="252">
the con&s;titution, he had ever intended to comply, as far as
he <HI>ea&s;ily</HI> could, with the antient forms of admini&s;tration:
But when the&s;e forms appeared to him, by the inveterate
ob&s;tinacy of the commons, to have no other tendency than
to di&s;turb that harmony, and to introduce a new con&s;titu|tion;
he concluded, that, in this violent &s;ituation, what
was &s;ubordinate mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily yield to what was principal,
and the privileges of the people, for a time, give place to
royal prerogative. From the rank of a monarch, to be de|graded
into a &s;lave of his in&s;olent &s;ubjects, &s;eemed, of all
indignities, the greate&s;t; and nothing, in his judgment,
could exceed the humiliation attending &s;uch a &s;tate, but the
meanne&s;s of tamely &s;ubmitting to it, without making &s;ome
efforts to pre&s;erve the authority tran&s;mitted to him by his
predece&s;&s;ors.</P>
<P>THO' the&s;e were his reflections and re&s;olutions before the
parliament a&s;&s;embled, he did not immediately break with
them, upon their delay of voting him this &s;upply. He
thought that he could better ju&s;tify any &s;trong mea&s;ure
which he might afterwards be obliged to take, if he allowed
them to carry to the utmo&s;t extremity their attacks upon
his government and prerogative<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Ru&s;hworth, vol. i. p. 642.</NOTE>. He contented him&s;elf,
for the pre&s;ent, with &s;oliciting the hou&s;e by me&s;&s;ages and
&s;peeches. But the commons, in&s;tead of hearkening to his
&s;olicitations, proceeded to carry their cen&s;orial &s;crutiny into
his management of religion<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Idem ibid. p. 651. Whitlocke, p. 12.</NOTE>, which was the only griev|ance
to which they had not as yet, by their petition of
right, applied a &s;ufficient remedy.</P>
<P>IT was not po&s;&s;ible that this century,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Arminian|i&s;m.</NOTE> &s;o fertile in reli|gious
&s;ects and di&s;putes, could e&s;cape the controver&s;y con|cerning
fatali&s;m and free-will, which, being &s;trongly inter|woven
both with philo&s;ophy and theology, had in all ages
thrown every &s;chool and every church into &s;uch inextricable
<PB N="211" REF="253">
doubt and perplexity. The fir&s;t reformers in England, as
in other European countries, had embraced the mo&s;t rigid
tenets of prede&s;tination and ab&s;olute decrees, and had com|po&s;ed,
upon that &s;y&s;tem, all the articles of their religious
creed. But the&s;e principles having met with oppo&s;ition
from Arminius and his &s;ectaries, the controver&s;y was &s;oon
brought into this i&s;land, and began here to diffu&s;e it&s;elf.
The Arminians, finding more encouragement from the &s;u|per&s;titious
&s;pirit of the church than from the fanatici&s;m of
the puritans, gradually incorporated them&s;elves with the
former; and &s;ome of that &s;ect, by the indulgence of James
and Charles, had attained the highe&s;t offices and preferments
in the hierarchy. But their &s;ucce&s;s with the public had not
been altogether an&s;werable to that which they met with in
the church and the court. Throughout the nation, they
&s;till lay under the reproach of innovation and here&s;y. The
commons now levelled again&s;t them their formidable cen&s;ures,
and made them the objects of daily invective and declama|tion.
Their protectors were &s;tigmatized; their tenets can|va&s;&s;ed;
their views repre&s;ented as dangerous and pernicious.
To impartial &s;pectators &s;urely, if any &s;uch had been at that
time in England, it mu&s;t have given great entertainment, to
&s;ee a popular a&s;&s;embly, enflamed with faction and enthu|&s;ia&s;m,
pretend to handle que&s;tions, for which the greate&s;t
philo&s;ophers, in the tranquillity of retreat, had never hi|therto
been able to find any &s;atisfactory &s;olution.</P>
<P>AMIDST that complication of di&s;putes in which men
were involved, we may ob&s;erve, that the appellation <HI>puritan</HI>
&s;tood for three parties, which, though commonly united to|gether,
were yet actuated by very different views and mo|tives.
There were the political puritans, who maintained
the highe&s;t principles of civil liberty; the puritans in di&s;ci|pline,
who were aver&s;e to the ceremonies and epi&s;copal go|vernment
of the church; and the doctrinal puritans, who
rigidly defended the &s;peculative &s;y&s;tem of the fir&s;t reformers.
In oppo&s;ition to all the&s;e &s;tood the court-party, the hierarchy,
<PB N="212" REF="254">
and the Arminians; only with this di&s;tinction, that the latter
&s;ect, being introduced a few years before, did not as yet
comprehend all tho&s;e who were favourable to the church
and to monarchy. But, as the controver&s;ies on every &s;ub|ject
grew daily warmer, men united them&s;elves more inti|mately
with their friends, and &s;eparated them&s;elves wider
from their antagoni&s;ts; and the di&s;tinction gradually be|came
quite uniform and regular.</P>
<P>THIS hou&s;e of commons, which, like all the preceding
ones during the reigns of James and Charles, and even of
Elizabeth, had been much governed by the puritanical
party, thought that they could not better &s;erve their cau&s;e,
than by &s;tigmatizing and puni&s;hing the Arminian &s;ect, which,
introducing an innovation in the church, were the lea&s;t fa|voured
and lea&s;t powerful of all their antagoni&s;ts. From
this mea&s;ure, it was ea&s;ily fore&s;een, that, be&s;ides gratifying
the animo&s;ity of the doctrinal puritans, both the puritans
in di&s;cipline and tho&s;e in politics would reap con&s;iderable
advantages. Laud, Neile, Montague, and other bi&s;hops,
who were the chief &s;upporters of epi&s;copal government,
and the mo&s;t zealous partizans of the di&s;cipline and cere|monies
of the church, were all &s;uppo&s;ed to be tainted with
Arminiani&s;m. The &s;ame men and their di&s;ciples were the
&s;trenuous preachers of pa&s;&s;ive obedience, and of entire &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion
to princes; and if the&s;e could once be cen&s;ured,
and be expelled the church and court, it was concluded,
that the hierarchy would receive a mortal blow, the cere|monies
be le&s;s rigidly in&s;i&s;ted on, and the King, deprived
of his mo&s;t faithful friends, be obliged to abate tho&s;e high
claims of prerogative on which at pre&s;ent he in&s;i&s;ted.</P>
<P>BUT Charles, be&s;ides a view of the political con&s;equences
which mu&s;t re&s;ult from a compliance with &s;uch preten&s;ions,
was &s;trongly determined, from principles of piety and con|&s;cience,
to oppo&s;e them. Neither the di&s;&s;ipation incident
to youth, nor the plea&s;ures attending a high fortune, had
<PB N="213" REF="255">
been able to prevent this virtuous Prince from embracing
the mo&s;t &s;incere &s;entiments of religion; and that character,
which in that religious age ought to have been of infinite
advantage to him, proved in the end the chief cau&s;e of his
ruin: Merely becau&s;e the religion adopted by him was not
of that preci&s;e mode and &s;ect which began to prevail among
his &s;ubjects. His piety, tho' remote from popery, had a
tincture of &s;uper&s;tition in it; and, being aver&s;e to the
gloomy &s;pirit of the puritans, was repre&s;ented by them as
tending towards the abominations of antichri&s;t. Laud al&s;o
had unfortunately acquired a great a&s;cendant over him:
And as all tho&s;e prelates, &s;truck at by the commons, were
regarded as his chief friends and mo&s;t favoured courtiers;
he was re&s;olved not to di&s;arm and di&s;honour him&s;elf, by
abandoning them to the re&s;entment of his enemies. Being
totally unprovided of military force, and finding a refractory
independent &s;pirit to prevail among the people; the mo&s;t
&s;olid ba&s;is of his authority, he thought, con&s;i&s;ted in the
&s;upport which he received from the hierarchy.</P>
<P>IN the debates of the commons, which are tran&s;mitted to
us, 'tis ea&s;y to di&s;cern &s;o early &s;ome &s;parks of that enthu|&s;ia&s;tic
fire, which afterwards &s;et the whole nation in com|bu&s;tion.
One Rou&s;e made u&s;e of an allu&s;ion, which, tho'
very familiar, &s;eems to have been borrowed from the writings
of Lord Bacon. &startq;If a man meet a dog alone,&endq; &s;aid he,
&startq;the dog is fearful, tho' never &s;o fierce by nature: But,
if the dog have his ma&s;ter with him, he will &s;et upon
that man, from whom he fled before. This &s;hows, that
lower natures, being backed by higher, increa&s;e in cou|rage
and &s;trength; and certainly man, being backed with
omnipotency, is a kind of omnipotent creature. All
things are po&s;&s;ible to him that believes; and where all
things are po&s;&s;ible, there is a kind of omnipotency.
Wherefore, let it be the unanimous con&s;ent and re&s;olu|tion
of us all to make a vow and covenant from hence|forth
<PB N="214" REF="256">
to hold fa&s;t our God and our religion; and then &s;hall
we henceforth expect with certainty happine&s;s in this
world<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Ru&s;hworth, vol. i. p. 646. Parl. Hi&s;t. vol. viii. p. 260.</NOTE>.&endq;</P>
<P>OLIVER CROMWEL, at that time a young man of no
account in the nation, is mentioned in the&s;e debates, as comp|laining
of one, who, he was told, preached flat popery<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Ru&s;h. vol. i. p. 655. Parl. Hi&s;t. vol. viii. p. 289.</NOTE>.
'Tis amu&s;ing to ob&s;erve the fir&s;t words of this fanatical
hypocrite corre&s;pond &s;o exactly to his character.</P>
<P>THE enquiries and debates concerning tonnage and
poundage went hand in hand with the&s;e theological or me|taphy&s;ical
controver&s;ies. The officers of the cu&s;tom-hou&s;e
were &s;ummoned before the commons, to give an account by
what authority they had &s;eized the goods of merchants who
had refu&s;ed to pay the&s;e duties: The barons of the exche|quer
were que&s;tioned concerning their decrees on that
head<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Ru&s;hworth, vol. i. p. 654. Parl. Hi&s;t. vol. viii. p. 301.</NOTE>. The &s;heriff of London was com$itted to the Tower
for his $word$ in &s;upporting the officers of the cu&s;tom|hou&s;e:
The goods of Rolles, a merchant, and member of
the hou&s;e, being &s;eized for his refu&s;al to pay the duties,
complaints were made of this violence, as if it were a breach
of privilege<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Ru&s;hworth, vol. i. p. 653.</NOTE>: Charles &s;upported his officers in all the&s;e
mea&s;ures; and the quarrel grew every day higher between
him and the commons<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Ru&s;hworth, vol. i. p. 658.</NOTE>. Mention was made in the hou&s;e
of impeaching Sir Richard We&s;ton, lord trea&s;urer<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Parl. Hi&s;t. vol. viii. p. 326.</NOTE>; and
the King began to entertain thoughts of fini&s;hing the &s;e&s;&s;ion
by a di&s;&s;olution.</P>
<P>SIR John Elliot framed a remon&s;trance again&s;t levying
tonnage and poundage without con&s;ent of parliament, and
offered it to the clerk to read. It was refu&s;ed. He read
it him&s;elf. The que&s;tion being then called for, the &s;peaker,
Sir John Finch, &s;aid, <HI>That he had a command from the
<PB N="215" REF="257">
King to adjourn, and to put no que&s;tions</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">The King's power of adjourning, as well as proroguing the parliament, was &s;carce ever que&s;tioned. In the 19th of the late King, the judges deter|mined, that the adjournment by the King kept the parliament <HI>in &s;tatu quo</HI> until the next &s;itting; but that then no committees were to meet: But if the adjournment be by the hou&s;e, then the committees and other matters do continue.

he ro&s;e and left the chair. The whole hou&s;e was in an
uproar. The &s;peaker was pu&s;hed back into the chair, and
forcibly held in it by Hollis and Valentine, till a &s;hort re|mon&s;trance
was framed, and was pa&s;&s;ed by acclamation ra|ther
than by vote. Papi&s;ts and Arminians were there de|clared
capital enemies to the commonwealth. Tho&s;e, who
levied tonnage and poundage, were branded with the &s;ame
epithet. And even the merchants, who &s;hould voluntarily
pay the&s;e duties, were denominated betrayers of Engli&s;h
liberty, and public enemies. The doors being locked, the
gentleman u&s;her of the hou&s;e of lords, who was &s;ent by
the King, could get no admittance till this remon&s;trance
was fini&s;hed. By the King's order, he took the mace from
the table, which ended their proceedings<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Ru&s;hworth, vol. i. p. 660. Whitlocke, p. 12.</NOTE>. And a few
days after the parliament was di&s;&s;olved.</P>
<P>THE di&s;contents of the nation ran extremely high, on
account of this violent rupture between the King and par|liament.
The&s;e di&s;contents Charles inflamed by his affecta|tion
of a &s;everity, which he had not power, nor probably
inclination, to carry to extremity. Sir Miles Hobart,
Sir Peter Heyman, Selden, Coriton, Long, Strode, were com|mitted
to pri&s;on, on account of the la&s;t tumult in the hou&s;e,
which was called &s;edition<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Ru&s;h. vol. i. p. 661, 681. Parl. Hi&s;t. vol. viii. p. 354. May, p. 13.</NOTE>. With great difficulty, and
after &s;everal delays, they were relea&s;ed; and the law was
generally &s;uppo&s;ed to be wre&s;ted, in order to prolong their
impri&s;onment. Sir John Elliot, Hollis, and Valentine, were
&s;ummoned to their trial in the king's bench, for &s;editious
&s;peeches and behaviour in parliament; but refu&s;ing to an|&s;wer
<PB N="216" REF="258">
before an inferior court for their conduct, as members
of a &s;uperior, they were condemned to be impri&s;oned du|ring
the King's plea&s;ure, to find &s;ureties for their good be|haviour,
and to be fined, the two former a thou&s;and pounds
a-piece, the latter five hundred<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Ru&s;hworth, vol. i. p. 684, 691.</NOTE>. This &s;entence, procured
by the influence of the crown, &s;erved only to &s;how the
King's di&s;regard to the privileges of parliament, and to ac|quire
an immen&s;e &s;tock of popularity to the &s;ufferers,
who had &s;o bravely, in oppo&s;ition to arbitrary power, defended
the liberties of their native country. The commons of
England, tho' an immen&s;e body, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the greate&s;t
part of the national property, were naturally &s;omewhat de|fencele&s;s;
becau&s;e of their per&s;onal equality and their want
of leaders: But the King's &s;everity, if the&s;e illegal pro&s;e|cutions
de&s;erve the name, here pointed out leaders to them,
who&s;e re&s;entment was inflamed, and who&s;e courage was
no-wi&s;e daunted, by the hard&s;hips which they had under|gone
in &s;o honourable a cau&s;e.</P>
<P>So much did the&s;e pri&s;oners glory in their &s;ufferings,
that, though they were promi&s;ed liberty on that condition,
they would not conde&s;cend even to pre&s;ent a petition to the
King, expre&s;&s;ing their &s;orrow for having offended him<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Whitlocke, p. 13.</NOTE>.
They unanimou&s;ly refu&s;ed to find &s;ureties for their good
behaviour; and di&s;dained to accept of deliverance on &s;uch
ea&s;y terms. Nay, Hollis was &s;o indu&s;trious to continue his
meritorious di&s;tre&s;s, that when one offered to bail him, he
would not yield to the rule of court, and be him&s;elf bound
with his friend. Even Long, who had actually found &s;ure|ties
in the chief ju&s;tice's chamber, declared in court, that
his &s;ureties &s;hould no longer continue<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Ken|$et, vol. iii. p. 49.</NOTE>. Yet becau&s;e Sir
John Elliot happened to die while in cu&s;tody, a great cla|mour

<P>THERE now opens to us a new &s;cene. Charles, na|turally
di&s;gu&s;ted with parliaments, was re&s;olved not
to call any more, till he &s;hould &s;ee greater indications of
a compliant di&s;po&s;ition in the nation. Having lo&s;t his great
favourite, Buckingham, he became his own mini&s;ter; and
never afterwards repo&s;ed in any one &s;uch unlimited confi|dence.
As he chiefly follows his own genius and di&s;po&s;i|tion,
his mea&s;ures are henceforth le&s;s ra&s;h and ha&s;ty; tho'
the general tenor of his admini&s;tration &s;till wants &s;omewhat
of being intirely legal, and more of being intirely prudent.</P>
<P>WE &s;hall endeavour to exhibit a ju&s;t idea of the events
which followed for &s;ome years; &s;o far as they regard foreign
affairs, the &s;tate of the court, and the government of the
nation. The incidents are neither numerous nor illu&s;trious;
but the knowlege of them is nece&s;&s;ary for under&s;tanding the
&s;ub&s;equent tran&s;actions, which are &s;o memorable.</P>
<P>CHARLES, de&s;titute of all &s;upply, was obliged from ne|ce&s;&s;ity
to embrace a mea&s;ure, which ought to have been the
re&s;ult of rea&s;on and &s;ound policy: He made peace with the
two crowns, again&s;t whom he had hitherto waged a war,
which was entered upon without nece&s;&s;ity, and was con|ducted
without glory. Notwith&s;tanding the di&s;tracted and
helple&s;s condition of England, no attempt was made, either
<PB N="218" REF="260">
by France or Spain,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. LII.</NOTE> to invade their enemy; nor did they
entertain any farther project, than to defend them&s;elves
again&s;t the feeble and ill-concerted expeditions of that king|dom.
Plea&s;ed that the jealou&s;ies and quarrels between King
and parliament had di&s;armed &s;o formidable a power,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Peace with France and Spain. April 14.</NOTE> they
carefully avoided any enterprize which might rou&s;e either
the terror or anger of the Engli&s;h,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1630.</NOTE> and di&s;po&s;e them to do|me&s;tic
union and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion. The endeavours to regain
the good-will of the nation were carried &s;o far by the king
of Spain,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nov. 5.</NOTE> that he generou&s;ly relea&s;ed and &s;ent home all the
Engli&s;h prisoners taken in the expedition again&s;t Cadiz.
The example was imitated by France, after the retreat of
the Engli&s;h from the i&s;le of Rh$. When princes were in
&s;uch di&s;po&s;itions, and had &s;o few preten&s;ions on each other,
it could not be difficult to conclude a peace. The treaty
was fir&s;t &s;igned with France<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Ru&s;h. vol. ii. p. 23, 24.</NOTE>. The &s;ituation of the King's
affairs did not intitle him to demand any conditions for the
hugonots, and they were abandoned to the will of their &s;o|vereign.
Peace was afterwards concluded with Spain;
where no conditions were made in favour of the Palatine,
except that Spain promi&s;ed in general to u&s;e her good offices
for his re&s;toration<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Idem ibid. p. 75. Whitlocke, p. 14.</NOTE>. The influence of the&s;e two wars on
dome&s;tic affairs, and on the di&s;po&s;itions of King and people,
was of the utmo&s;t con&s;equence: But no alteration was made
by them on the foreign intere&s;ts of the kingdom.</P>
<P>NOTHING more happy can be imagined than the &s;itua|tion
in which England then &s;tood with regard to foreign
affairs. Europe was divided between the rival families of
Bourbon and Au&s;tria, who&s;e oppo&s;ite intere&s;ts, and &s;till
more their mutual jealou&s;ies, &s;ecured the tranquillity of this
i&s;land. Their forces were &s;o nearly counterpoi&s;ed, that no
apprehen&s;ions were entertained of any event which could
&s;uddenly di&s;turb the balance of power between them. The
<PB N="219" REF="261">
Spani&s;h monarch, deemed the mo&s;t powerful, lay at greate&s;t
distance; and the Engli&s;h, by that means, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the
advantage of being engaged by political motives into a more
intimate union and confederacy with the neighbouring po|tentate.
The di&s;per&s;ed &s;ituation of the Spani&s;h dominions
rendered the naval power of England very formidable to
them, and kept that empire in continual dependence. France,
more vigorous and more compact, was every day ri&s;ing in
policy and di&s;cipline; and reached at la&s;t an equality of
power with the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria: But her progre&s;s, &s;low
and gradual, left it &s;till in the power of England, by a
timely interpo&s;al, to check her &s;uperiority. And thus
Charles, could he have avoided all diffen&s;ions with his own
&s;ubjects, was in a &s;ituation to make him&s;elf be courted and
re&s;pected by every power in Europe; and, what has &s;carce
ever &s;ince been attained by the princes of this i&s;land, he
could either be active with dignity, or neutral with &s;ecu|rity.</P>
<P>A NEUTRALITY was embraced by the King; and, du|ring
the re&s;t of his reign, he &s;eems to have little regarded
foreign affairs, except &s;o far as he was engaged by honour,
and by friend&s;hip for his &s;i&s;ter and the Palatine, to endea|vour
the procuring &s;ome relief for that unhappy family. He
joined his good offices to tho&s;e of France, and mediated a
peace between the kings of Sweden and Poland, in hopes of
engaging the former to embrace the protection of the op|pre&s;&s;ed
prote&s;tants in the empire. This was the famous
Gustavus, who&s;e heroic genius, &s;econded by the wi&s;e&s;t po|licy,
made him in a little time the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed mon|arch
of the age, and rendered his country, formerly un|known
and neglected, of great weight in the balance of
Europe. To encourage and a&s;&s;i&s;t him in his projected in|va&s;ion
of Germany, Charles agreed to furni&s;h him with &s;ix
thou&s;and men; but, that he might pre&s;erve the appearance
of neutrality, he made u&s;e of the Marquis of Hamilton's
<PB N="220" REF="262">
name, a nobleman allied to the crown<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Ru&s;h, vol. i. p. 46, 53, 62, 83.</NOTE>. Hamilton entered
into an engagement with Gu&s;tavus; and, inli&s;ting the&s;e
troops in England and Scotland at Charles's expence, he
landed them in the Elbe. The deci&s;ive battle of Leip&s;ic
was fought &s;oon after; where the conduct of Tilly and
the valour of the imperiali&s;ts, were overcome by the &s;upe|rior
conduct of Gu&s;tavus and the &s;uperior valour of the
Swedes. What remained of this hero's life was one conti|nued
&s;eries of victory, for which he was le&s;s beholden to
fortune, than to tho&s;e per&s;onal endowments which he de|rived
from nature and from indu&s;try. That rapid progre&s;s
of conque&s;t, which we &s;o much admire in antient hi&s;tory,
was here renewed in modern annals; and without that
cau&s;e, to which, in former ages, it had ever been owing.
Military nations were not now engaged again&s;t an undi&s;ci|plined
and unwarlike people; nor heroes &s;et in oppo&s;ition
to cowards. The veteran troops of Ferdinand, conducted
by the mo&s;t celebrated generals of the age, were foiled in
every encounter, and all Germany was over-run in an in&s;tant
by the victorious Swede. But by this extraordinary and
unexpected &s;uccess of his ally, Charles failed of the purpo&s;e
for which he framed the alliance. Gu&s;tavus, elated by pro|&s;perity,
began to form more exten&s;ive plans of ambition;
and in freeing Germany from the yoke of Ferdinand, he in|tended
to reduce it to &s;ubjection under his own. He re|fu&s;ed
to re&s;tore the Palatine to his principality, except on con|ditions
which would have kept him in total dependence<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Franklyn, p. 415.</NOTE>.
And thus the negotiation was protracted; till the battle of
Lutzen, where the Swedi&s;h monarch peri&s;hed in the mid&s;t
of a complete victory, which he obtained over his ene|mies.</P>
<P>WE have carried on the&s;e tran&s;actions a few years beyond

to them;<NOTE PLACE="marg">State of the court and mini&s;try.</NOTE> nor be henceforth interrupted in our account of
Charles's court and kingdoms.</P>
<P>WHEN we con&s;ider Charles as pre&s;iding in his court, as
a&s;&s;ociated with his family, it is difficult to imagine a cha|racter
at once more re&s;pectable and more amiable. A kind
hu&s;band, an indulgent father, a gentle ma&s;ter, a &s;tedfa&s;t
friend; to all the&s;e eulogies, his conduct in private life
fully intitled him. As a monarch too, in the exterior quali|ties,
he excelled; in the e&s;&s;ential, he was not defective. His
addre&s;s and manner, tho' perhaps inclining a little towards
&s;tateline&s;s and formality, in the main corre&s;ponded to his high
rank, and gave grace to that re&s;erve and gravity which were
natural to him. The moderation and equity, which &s;hone
forth in his temper, <HI>&s;eemed</HI> to &s;ecure him again&s;t ra&s;h and
dangerous enterprizes: The good &s;en&s;e, which he di&s;played
in his di&s;cour&s;e and conver&s;ation, <HI>&s;eemed</HI> to warrant his &s;uc|ce&s;s
in every rea&s;onable undertaking. Other endowments
likewi&s;e he enjoyed, which, in a private gentleman, would
have been highly ornamental, and which, in a great mon|arch,
might have proved extremely u&s;eful to his people.
He was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of an excellent ta&s;te in all the fine arts;
and the love of painting was in &s;ome degree his favourite
pa&s;&s;ion. Learned beyond what is common in princes, he
was a good judge of writing in others, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, him|&s;elf,
no mean talent in compo&s;ition. In any other age or
nation, this monarch had been &s;ecure of a pro&s;perous and
a happy reign. But the high idea of his own authority,
with which he had been imbued, made him incapable of
giving way to the &s;pirit of liberty which began to prevail
among his &s;ubjects. His politics were not &s;upported with
&s;uch vigour and fore&s;ight as might enable him to &s;ubdue
their privileges, and maintain his prerogative at the high
pitch to which it had been rai&s;ed. And above all, the &s;pirit
of enthu&s;ia&s;m, being univer&s;ally diffu&s;ed over the nation,
di&s;appointed all the views of human prudence, and dif|turbed
<PB N="222" REF="264">
the operation of every motive which u&s;ually influ|ence

<P>BUT the misfortunes, produced by the&s;e cau&s;es, were
yet remote, Charles now enjoyed him&s;elf in the full exer|ci&s;e
of his authority, in a &s;ocial intercour&s;e with his friends
and courtiers, and in a moderate u&s;e of tho&s;e plea&s;ures
which he mo&s;t affected.</P>
<P>AFTER the death of Buckingham,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Character of the Queen.</NOTE> who had &s;omewhat alienated Charles from the Queen, &s;he is to be con&s;idered
as his chief friend and favourite. That ru&s;tic contempt
of the fair &s;ex, which James affected, and which, bani&s;h|ing
them from his court, made it re&s;emble more a fair or
an exchange, than the feat of a great prince, was very wide
of the di&s;po&s;ition of this monarch. But tho' full of com|plai&s;ance
to the whole &s;ex, Charles re&s;erved all his pa&s;&s;ion
for the Queen, to whom he attached him&s;elf with un&s;haken
fidelity and confidence. By her &s;en&s;e and &s;pirit, as well as
by her beauty, &s;he justified the fondne&s;s of her hu&s;band;
tho' it is allowed, that, being &s;omewhat of a pa&s;&s;ionate
temper, &s;he precipitated him into ha&s;ty and imprudent coun|&s;els.
Her religion likewi&s;e, to which &s;he was much ad|dicted,
mu&s;t be regarded as a great misfortune; &s;ince it
augmented the jealou&s;y which prevailed against the court,
and engaged her to procure for the catholics &s;ome in|dulgences
which were generally di&s;tas&s;eful to the nation<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">May, p. 21.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IN the former &s;ituation of the Engli&s;h government, when
the &s;overeign was in a great mea&s;ure independent of his &s;ub|jects,
the King cho&s;e his mini&s;ters, either from per&s;onal
favour, or from an opinion of their ability; without any
regard to their parliamentary interest or talents. It has
&s;ince been the maxim of princes, where-ever popular leaders
encroach too much on royal authority, to confer offices on
them; in expectation that they will afterwards become
<PB N="223" REF="265">
more careful not to dimini&s;h that power which has become
their own. The&s;e politics were now embraced by Charles;
a sure proof that a &s;ecret revolution had happened in the
constitution, and had nece&s;&s;itated the prince to adopt new
maxims of government<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Sir Ed. Walker, p. 328.</NOTE> But the views of the King were
at this time so repugnant to tho&s;e of the puritans, that the
leaders, whom he gained, lo&s;t from that moment all intere&s;t
with their party, and were even pur&s;ued as traitors, with
implacable hatred and re&s;entment.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Strafford</NOTE> This was the ca&s;e with
Sir Thomas Wentworth, whom the King created, fir&s;t a
baron, then a vi&s;count, and afterwards earl of Strafford;
made him pre&s;ident of the council of York, and Lord de|puty
of Ireland; and regarded him as his chief mini&s;ter and
coun&s;ellor. By his eminent talents and abilities, Strafford
merited all the confidence which the King repo&s;ed in him:
His character was &s;tately and au&s;tere; more fitted to pro|cure
e&s;teem than love: His &s;idelity to his ma&s;ter was un|shaken;
but as he now employed all his coun&s;els to &s;upport
the prerogative which he had formerly bent all his endea|vours
to dimini&s;h, his virtue &s;eems not to have been intirely
pure, but to have been &s;u&s;ceptible of &s;trong impre&s;&s;ions
from private intere&s;t and ambition, Sir Dudley Digges was
about the &s;ame time created ma&s;ter of the rolls: Noy, at|torney-general:

<P>IN all eccle&s;ia&s;tical affairs, and even in many civil,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Laud.</NOTE> Laud,
bi&s;hop of London, had great influence on the King. This
man was virtuous, if &s;everity of manners alone and ab&s;ti|nence
from plea&s;ure could de&s;erve that name. He was
learned, if polemical knowlege could intitle him to that
prai&s;e. He was di&s;intere&s;ted, but with uncea&s;ing indu&s;try
he &s;tudied to exalt the prie&s;tly and prelatical character, which
was his own. His zeal was unrelenting in the cau&s;e of reli|gion;
<PB N="224" REF="266">
that is, in impo&s;ing, by the mo&s;t rigorous mea&s;ures,
his own tenets and pious ceremonies on the ob&s;tinate puri|tans,
who had pro&s;anely dared to oppo&s;e him. In pro&s;ecu|tion
of his holy purpo&s;es, he overlooked every human con|&s;ideration;
or, in other words, the heat and indi&s;cretion
of his temper made him neglect the views of prudence and
rules of good manners. He was in this re&s;pect happy, that
all his enemies were al&s;o imagined by him the declared ene|mies
to loyalty and true piety, and that every exerci&s;e of
his revenge, by that means, became in his eyes a merit and
a virtue. This was the man who acquired &s;o great an
a&s;cendant over Charles, and who led him, by the facility of
his temper, into a conduct which proved so fatal to him|&s;elf
and to his kingdoms.</P>
<P>THE humour of the nation ran at that time into the ex|treme
oppo&s;ite to &s;uper&s;tition;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Innovations in the church.</NOTE> and it was with difficulty
that the antient ceremonies, to which men had been accu&s;|tomed,
and which had been &s;anctified by the practice of
the fir&s;t reformers, could be retained in divine &s;ervice:
Yet was this the time which Laud cho&s;e for the introduction
of new ceremonies and ob&s;ervances. Be&s;ides that the&s;e were
&s;ure to di&s;plea&s;e as innovations, there lay, in the opinion of
the public, another very forcible objection against them,
Laud, and the other prelates who embraced his mea&s;ures,
were generally well in&s;tructed in &s;acred antiquity, and had
adopted all tho&s;e religious sentiments which prevailed during
the fourth and fifth centuries; when the chri&s;tian church,
as is well known, was already &s;unk into those &s;uperstitions
which, were afterwards continued and augmented by the po|licy
of Rome. The revival, therefore, of the ideas and
practices of that age could not fail of giving the Engli&s;h
faith and liturgy &s;ome re&s;emblance to the catholic &s;uper&s;ti|tion,
which the kingdom in general, and the puritans in
particular, held in the greate&s;t horror and dete&s;tation. Men
al&s;o were apt to think, that, without &s;ome &s;ecret purpo&s;e,
<PB N="225" REF="267">
&s;uch in&s;ignificant ob&s;ervances would not be impo&s;ed with
&s;uch unrelenting zeal on the refractory &s;pirit of the nation;
and that Laud's &s;cheme was to lead back the Engli&s;h, by
gradual steps, to the religion of their ance&s;tors. They
con&s;idered not, that the very in&s;igni&s;icancy of the&s;e
ceremonies recommended them to the &s;uper&s;titious prelate, and
made them appear the more peculiarly &s;acred and religious,
that they could &s;erve no other purpo&s;e. Nor was the re|&s;emblance
to the Romi&s;h ritual any objection, but rather a
merit, with Laud and his brethren; who bore a much
greater kindne&s;s to the mother-church, as they called her,
than to the &s;ectaries and pre&s;byterians, and frequently re|commended
her as a true chri&s;tian church; an appellation
which they refu&s;ed, or at least &s;crupled, to the others<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">May, p. 25.</NOTE>. So
openly were the&s;e tenets e&s;pou&s;ed, that not only the dis|contented
puritans believed the church of England to be
relap&s;ing fa&s;t into Romi&s;h super&s;tition: The court of Rome
it&s;elf entertained hopes of regaining its authority in this
i&s;land; and, in order to forward Laud's good intentions, an
offer was twice made him, in private, of a cardinal's hat,
which he declined accepting<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Ru&s;hworth, vol. ii. p. 190. Welwood, p. 61.</NOTE>. His an&s;wer was, as he &s;ays
him&s;elf, <HI>That something dwelt within him, which would not
&s;uffer his compliance, till Rome was other than it is</HI><NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Ru&s;h. vol. iii. p. 1327. Whitlocks, p. 97.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>A COURT lady, daughter of the Earl of Devon&s;hire,
having turned catholic, was asked by Laud the reasons of
her conver&s;ion. <HI>'Tis chiefly,</HI> &s;aid she, <HI>becau&s;e I hate to
travel in a crowd.</HI> The meaning of this expre&s;&s;ion being
demanded, she replied, <HI>I perceive your Grace and many
others are making haste to Rome; and therefore, in order
to prevent my being crowded, I have gone before you.</HI> It
must be confe&s;&s;ed, that, tho' Laud de&s;erved not the appel|lation
of papi&s;t, the genius of his religion was, tho' in a
le&s;s degree, yet the &s;ame with that of the Romi&s;h: The
<PB N="226" REF="268">
&s;ame profound re&s;pect was exacted to the &s;acerdotal cha|racter,
the &s;ame &s;ubmission required to the creeds and de|crees
of &s;ynods and councils, the &s;ame pomp and ceremony
was affected in wor&s;hip, and the &s;ame &s;uper&s;titious regard
to days, po&s;tures, meats, and ve&s;tments. No wonder, there|fore,
that this prelate was, every-where, among the puri|tans,
regarded with horror, as the forerunner of anti|chri&s;t.</P>
<P>As a &s;pecimen of the new ceremonies to which Laud
sacrificed his own quiet and that of the nation, it may not
be ami&s;s to relate those which he was accu&s;ed of employing
in the con&s;ecration of St. Catherine's church, and which
were the object of &s;uch general &s;candal and offence.</P>
<P>ON the bi&s;hop's approach to the we&s;t door of the church,
a loud voice cried, <HI>Open, open, ye everla&s;ting doors, that
the king of glory may enter in!</HI> Immediately the doors of
the church flew open, and the bi&s;hop entered. Falling
upon his knees, with eyes elevated and arms expanded, he
uttered the&s;e words: <HI>This place is holy; the ground is holy&punc;
In the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Gho&s;t, I pronounce
it holy.</HI></P>
<P>GOING towards the chancel, he &s;everal times took up
from the floor some of the du&s;t, and threw it $word$.
When he approached, with his attendants, $ar to the
communion-table, he bowed frequently towards it: And on
their return, they went round the church, repeating as they
marched along, some of the p&s;alms: And then $word$ form
of prayer, which concluded with the&s;e words: <HI>We con&s;e$
crate this church, and &s;eparate it unto thee as holy ground,
not to be profaned any more to common u&s;es.</HI></P>
<P>AFTER this, the bi&s;hop, &s;tanding near the communion|table,
&s;olemnly pronounced many imprecations upon &s;uch
as &s;hould afterwards pollute that holy place by musters of
soldiers, or keeping in it profane law-courts, or carrying
<PB N="227" REF="269">
burthens, thro' it. On the conclu&s;ion of every cur&s;e, he
bowed towards the ea&s;t, and cried, <HI>Let all the people &s;ay,
amen.</HI></P>
<P>THE imprecations being all so piou&s;ly fini&s;hed, there
were poured out a number of ble&s;&s;ings upon &s;uch as had
any hand in framing and building that &s;acred and beautiful
edifice, and on &s;uch as had given, or &s;hould hereafter give
to it, any chalices, plate, ornaments, or uten&s;ils. At every
benediction, he in like manner bowed towards the ea&s;t, and
cried, <HI>Let all the people &s;ay, amen.</HI></P>
<P>THE &s;ermon &s;ucceeded; after which, the bi&s;hop con&s;e|crated
and admini&s;tered the &s;acrament in the following
manner:</P>
<P>As he approached the communion-table, he made many
lowly reverences: And coming up to that part of the table
$word$ the bread and wine lay, he bowed &s;even times.
After the reading of many prayer's, he approached the &s;a|cramental
elements, and gently lifted up the corner of the
napkin, in which the bread was laid. When he beheld
the bread, he &s;uddenly let fall the napkin, $lew back a &s;tep
or two, bowed three &s;everal times towards the bread; then
he drew near again, opened the napkin, and bowed as be|fore.</P>
<P>NEXT, he laid his hand on the cup, which had a cover
upon it, and was full of wine. He let go the cup, fell
back, and bowed thrice towards it. He approached again;
and lifting up the cover, peeped into the cup. Seeing the
wine, he let fall the cover, started back, and bowed as be|fore.
Then he received the &s;acrament, and gave it to others.
And many prayers being &s;aid, the &s;olemnity of the con&s;e|cration
ended. The walls and floor and roof of the fabric
were then &s;uppo&s;ed to be &s;ufficiently holy<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Ru&s;hworth, vol. ii. p. 76, 77. Welwood, p. 275. Frahklyn, p. 386.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="228" REF="270">
ORDERS were given, and rigorou&s;ly in&s;i&s;ted on, that the
communion&dash;table &s;hould be removed from the middle of the
area, where it hitherto &s;tood in all churches, except in ca|thedrals<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Ru&s;hworth vol. ii. p. 207. Whitlocke, p. 24.</NOTE>.
It was placed in the ea&s;t end, railed in, and de|nominated
an ALTAR; as the clergyman, who officiated,
received commonly the appellation of PRIEST. 'Tis not
ea&s;y to imagine the di&s;contents excited by this innovation,
and the &s;u&s;picions which it gave ri&s;e to.</P>
<P>THE kneeling at the altar, and the u&s;ing of copes, a
&s;pecies of embroidered ve&s;tment, in admini&s;tering the &s;acra|ment,
were al&s;o known to be great objects of &s;candal, as
being popi&s;h practices; But the oppo&s;ition rather increa&s;ed
than abated the zeal of the prelate, for the introduction of
the&s;e habits and ceremonies.</P>
<P>ALL kinds of ornament, e&s;pecially pictures, were nece&s;|&s;ary
for &s;upporting that mechanical devotion, which was
propo&s;ed to be rai&s;ed in this model of religion: But as
the&s;e had been &s;o much employed by the church of Rome,
and had given ri&s;e to &s;o much &s;uper&s;tition, or what the pu|ritans
called idolatry; it was impo&s;&s;ible to introduce them
into Engli&s;h churches, without exciting the mo&s;t general
murmurs and complaints. But Laud, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of pre&s;ent
authority, per&s;i&s;ted in his purpo&s;e, and made &s;everal at|tempts
towards acquiring the&s;e ornaments. Some of the
pictures, introduced by him, were al&s;o found, upon in|quiry,
to be the very &s;ame which might be met with in
the ma&s;s book. The crucifix too, that eternal con&s;olation
of all pious catholics, and terror to all &s;ound prote&s;tants,
was not forgot on this occa&s;ion<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Ru&s;hworth, vol. ii. p. 272, 273.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IT was much remarked, that Sherfield, the recorder of
Sali&s;bury, was tried in the &s;tar&dash;chamber, for having broke,
contrary to the bi&s;hop of Sali&s;bury's expre&s;s injunctions, a
painted window of St. Edmond's church in that city. He
<PB N="229" REF="271">
boa&s;ted, that he had de&s;troyed the&s;e monuments of ido|latry:
But for this effort of his zeal, he was fined $word$

<P>NOT only &s;uch of the clergy, as reglected to ob&s;erve
every ceremony, were &s;u&s;pended and deprived by the high|commi&s;&s;ion
court: Oaths were, by many of the bi&s;hops,
impo&s;ed on the churchwarden, and they were &s;worn to
inform again&s;t any one who acted contrary to the eccle&s;ia&s;tical
canons<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Ru&s;hworth, vol. ii. p. 186.</NOTE> Such a mea&s;ure, though practi&s;ed during
the reign of Elizabeth, gave much offence; as re&s;embling
too nearly the practice of the Romi&s;h inquifition.</P>
<P>To &s;how the greater alienation from the churches reformed
after the pre&s;byterian model, Laud advi&s;ed, that the di&s;ci|pline
and wor&s;hip of the church &s;hould be impo&s;ed on the
Engli&s;h regiments and trading companies abroad<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Idem ibid. p 249. Franklyn, p. 451.</NOTE> All
foreigners of the Dutch and Walloon congregations were

Scudamore too, the king's amba&s;&s;ador at Paris,
had orders to withdraw him&s;elf from the communion of the
hugonots. Even men of &s;en&s;e were apt to blame this con|duct,
not only becau&s;e it gave offence in England, but be|cau&s;e,
in foreign countries, it lo&s;t the crown the advantage
of being con&s;idered as, the head and &s;upport of the re|formation.</P>
<P>ON pretence of pacifying di&s;putes, orders were i&s;&s;ued
from the council, forbidding, on both &s;ides, all preaching,
and printing with regard to the controverted points of pre|defination
and free-will. But it was complained of, and
probably with rea&s;on, that the impartiality was altogether
<PB N="230" REF="272">
confined to the orders, and that the execution of them was
only meant again&s;t the calvini&s;ts.</P>
<P>IN return for Charles's indulgence towards the church,
Laud and his followers took care to magnify, on every oc|ca&s;ion,
the regal authority, and to treat, with the utmo&s;t
di&s;tain or dete&s;tation, all puritanical preten&s;ions to a free
and, independent con&s;titution. But while the&s;e prelates
were &s;o liberal in rai&s;ing the crown at the expence of pub|lic
liberty, they made no &s;cruple of incroaching, them|&s;elves,
on the royal rights the mo&s;t inconte&s;table; in order
to exalt the hierarchy, and procure to their own order do|minion
and independence. All the doctrines which the
Romi&s;h church had borrowed from &s;ome of the fathers,
and which freed the &s;piritual from &s;ubordination to the
civil power, were now adopted by the church of England,
and interwoven with her political and religious tenets. A
divine and apo&s;tolical charter was in&s;i&s;ted on, preferably to
a legal and parliamentary one<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Whitlocke, p. 22.</NOTE>. The &s;acerdotal character
was magnified as &s;acred and in indefeizable: All right to &s;pi|ritual
authority, or even to private judgment in &s;piritual
&s;ubjects, was refu&s;ed to profane laymen: Eccle&s;ia&s;tical
courts were held by the bi&s;hops in their own name, without
any notice taken of the King's authority: And Charles, tho'
extremely jealous of every claim in popular a&s;&s;emblies, &s;eemed
rather to encourage than repre&s;s tho&s;e encroachments of his
clergy. Having felt &s;ome &s;en&s;ible inconveniences from the
independent &s;pirit of parliaments, he attached him&s;elf in|tirely
to tho&s;e who profe&s;&s;ed a devoted obedience to his
crown and per&s;on; nor did he fore&s;ee, that the eccle&s;ia&s;tical
power which he exalted, not admitting of any preci&s;e
boundary, might in time become more dangerous to public
peace, and no le&s;s fatal to royal prerogative than the
other.</P>
<P>So early as the coronation, Laud was the per&s;on, accord|ing
to general opinion, who introduced a novelty, which,
<PB N="231" REF="273">
though overlooked by Charles, made a deep impre&s;&s;ion on
many of the bye&s;tanders. After the u&s;ual ceremonies,
the&s;e words were recited to the King: &startq; Stand and hold
fa&s;t, from henceforth, the place to which you have
been heir by the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of your forefathers, being
now delivered to you by the authority of Almighty God,
and by the hands of us and all the bi&s;hops and &s;ervants
of God. And, as you &s;ee the clergy to come nearer
the altar than others, &s;o remember, that, in all places
convenient, you give them greater honour; that the
Mediator of God and man may e&s;tabli&s;h you on the
kingly throne, to be a mediator betwixt the clergy and
the laity; and that you may reign for ever with Je&s;us
Chri&s;t, the King of kings, and Lord of lords<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Franklyn, p. 114, Ru&s;hworth, vol. i. p. 201.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE principles, which exalted prerogative, were not
entertained by the King, merely as &s;oft and agreeable to
his royal ears: They were al&s;o put in practice during all
the time that he ruled without parliaments. Tho' frugal
and regular in his expences, he wanted money for the
&s;upport of government; and he levied it, either by the
revival of ob&s;olete laws, or by violations, &s;ame more open,
&s;ome more di&s;gui&s;ed, of the privileges of the nation. Tho'
humane and gentle in his temper, he gave way to &s;everities
in the &s;tar-chamber and high-commi&s;&s;ion, which
&s;eemed nece&s;&s;ary, in order to &s;upport the pre&s;ent model of admi|ni&s;tration,
and repre&s;s the ri&s;ing &s;pirit of liberty through|out
the kingdom. Under the&s;e two heads, may be reduced
all the remarkable tran&s;actions of this reign, during &s;ome
years: For, in peaceable and pro&s;perous times, where a
neutrality in foreign affairs is ob&s;erved, &s;carce any thing
is remarkable, but what is, in &s;ome degree, blamed, or

reign, were exerci&s;ed again&s;t tho&s;e who triumphed in their
&s;ufferings, who courted per&s;ecution, and braved authority:
And, on that account, their puni&s;hment may be deemed the
more just, but the less prudent. To have neglected them
intirely, had it been con&s;i&s;tent with order and public &s;afety,
had been the wi&s;e&s;t mea&s;ure which could have been, em|braced;
as perhaps it had been the mo&s;t &s;evere puni&s;hment
which could have been inflicted on the&s;e zealots.</P>
<P>IN order to gratify the clergy with a magnificent fabric,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">1631.</NOTE> &s;ub&s;criptions were set on foot, for the repairing and rebuild|ing
St. Paul's; and the King, by his countenance and ex|ample,
encouraged this laudable undertaking<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Idem, p. 17.</NOTE>. By order
of the privy-council, St. Gregory's church was removed,
as an impediment to the project of extending and beautify|ing
the cathedral. Some hou&s;es and &s;hops likewi&s;e were
pulled down; and compen&s;ation was made to the propr$|etors<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Rush. vol. ii. p. 88, 89, 90. 207, 462, 718.</NOTE>
As there was no immediate pro&s;pect of a&s;&s;embling
a parliament, &s;uch acts of power in the King became ne|ce&s;&s;ary;
and in no former age would the people have en|tertained
any &s;cruple with regard to them. It mu&s;t be re|marked,
that the puritans were extremely aver&s;e to the
rai&s;ing this ornament to the capital. It favoured, as they
pretended, of popi&s;h &s;uper&s;tition.</P>
<P>AN office was erected for the &s;ealing of cards: A new

of the mo&s;t dangerous con&s;equence, when con&s;idered as ar|bitrary
and illegal<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Idem ibid. p. 103.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>MONOPOLIES were revived; an oppre&s;&s;ive method of le|vying
taxes, being unlimited as well as de&s;tructive of in|du&s;try.
<PB N="235" REF="277">
The la&s;t parliament of James, which aboli&s;hed
monopolies, had left a very equitable exception in favour of
new inventions; and on pretence of the&s;e, and of erecting
new companies and corporations, was this grievance now
renewed. The manufacture of &s;oap was given to a com|pany,
who paid a. &s;um for their patent<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Ru&s;hworth, vol. ii. p. 136, 142, 189, 252.</NOTE> Leather, &s;alt,

likewi&s;e put under restrictions.</P>
<P>'TIS affirmed by Clarendon, that &s;o little benefit was
reaped from the&s;e projects, that of 200,000 pounds levied
from the people &s;carce 1500 came into the King's coffers.
Tho' we ought not to &s;u&s;pect the noble hi&s;torian of exag|gerations
to the di&s;advantage of Charles's mea&s;ures; this
fact, it mu&s;t be owned, appears incredible. The &s;ame au|thor
adds, that the King's intention was to teach his &s;ubjects
how unthri&s;ty a thing it was to refu&s;e rea&s;onable &s;upplies to
the crown. An imprudent project! to offend a whole na|tion,
under the view of puni&s;hment; and to hope, by acts
of violence, to break their refractory &s;pirits, without being
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of any forces to prevent re&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>THE council of York had been fir&s;t erected,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1632.</NOTE> after a re|bellion,
by a patent from Henry VIII. without any auth|ority
of parliament; and this exerci&s;e of power, like many
others, was indulged to that arbitrary monarch. That
council had long acted chiefly as a criminal court; but, be|&s;ides
&s;ome innovations, introduced by James, Charles thought
proper, &s;ome time after Wentworth was made pre&s;ident, to
extend its powers, and to give it a large civil juri&s;diction,
and that, in &s;ome re&s;pects, di&s;cretionary<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Idem ibid, p. 158, 159, &amp;c. Franklyn, p. 412.</NOTE> 'Tis not impro|bable,

was the putting all the northern counties out of the

council were, this year, complained of<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Ra&s;hworth, vol. ii, p, 202, 203.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE court of &s;tar-chamber extended very far its autho|rity;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1633.</NOTE> and it was matter of complaint, that it encroached
upon the juri&s;diction of the other courts; impo&s;ing heavy
fines and in&s;licting &s;evere puni&s;hment, beyond the u&s;ual
cour&s;e of ju&s;tice. Sir David Foulis was fined 5000 pounds,
chiefly becau&s;e he had di&s;&s;uaded a friend from compounding
with die commi&s;&s;ioners of knighthood<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Idem ibid. p. 215, 216, &amp;c.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>PRYNNE, a barri&s;ter of Lincoln's-Inn, had wrote an
enormous quarto of a thou&s;and pages, which he called
<HI>Hi&s;torio-Ma&s;tyx.</HI> Its profe&s;&s;ed pnrpo&s;e was to decry &s;tage|plays,
comedies, interludes, mu&s;ic, dancing; but the au|thor
likewi&s;e took occa&s;ion to declaim again&s;t hunting, pub|lic
fe&s;tivals, Chri&s;tmas-keeping, bonfires, and May-poles.
His zeal again&s;t all the&s;e levities, he &s;ays, was fir&s;t moved, by
ob&s;erving, that plays &s;old better than the choice&s;t &s;ermons,
and that they were frequently printed on finer paper than
the Bible it&s;elf. Be&s;ides, that the players were often pa|pi&s;ts,
and de&s;perately wicked; the play-hou&s;es, he affirms,
are Satan's chapels, the play-haunters little better than in|carnate
devils; and &s;o many &s;teps in a dance, &s;o many paces
to hell. The chief crime of Nero he repre&s;ents to have
been, his frequenting and acting of plays; and tho&s;e, who
nobly con&s;pired his death, were principally moved to it, as
he affirms, by their indignation at that enormity. The re&s;t
of his thou&s;and pages were of a like &s;train. He had obtained
a licence from Archbi&s;hop Abbot's chaplain; yet was he in|dicted
in the &s;tar-chamber as a libeller. It was thought
&s;omewhat hard, that general invectives again&s;t plays, &s;hould
<PB N="237" REF="279">
be interpreted into &s;atires again&s;t the King and Queen,
merely becau&s;e they frequented the&s;e amu&s;ements, and be|cau&s;e
the Queen &s;ometimes acted a part in pa&s;torals and in|terludes,
which were repre&s;ented at court. The author, it
mu&s;t be owned, had, in plainer terms, blamed the hierar|chy,
the ceremonies, the innovations in religious wor&s;hip,
and the new &s;uper&s;titions, introduced by Laud<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">The mu&s;ic in the churches, he affirmed not to be the noi&s;e of men, but a bleating of brute bea&s;ts; choiri&s;ters bellow the tenor, as it were oxen; bark a counterpart, as it were a kennel of dogs; roar out a treble, as it were a &s;ort of bulls; and grunt out a ba&s;e, as it were a number of hogs: Chri&s;tmas, as it is kept, is the devil's Chri&s;tmas; and he employed a great number of pages to per&s;uade men to a&s;fect the name of <HI>Puritan,</HI> as if Chri&s;t were a puritan; and &s;o he &s;aith in his Index, Ru&s;hworth, vol. ii. p. 223.</NOTE>; and this
probably, together with the ob&s;tinacy and petulance of his
behaviour before the &s;tar-chamber, was the rea&s;on why his
&s;entence was &s;o &s;evere. He was condemned to be put from
the bar; to &s;tand on the pillory in two places, We&s;tmin&s;ter
and Cheap&s;ide; to lo&s;e both his ears, one in each place;
to pay 5000 pounds fine to the King; and to be impri&s;oned
during life<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Ru&s;h. ibid, p. 220, 221, &amp;c.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THIS &s;ame Prynne was a great hero among the puritans;
and it was chiefly with a view to mortify that &s;ect, that, tho'
of an honourable profe&s;&s;ion, he was condemned by the &s;tar|chamber
to &s;o ignominious a puni&s;hment. The thorough|paced
puritans were di&s;tingui&s;hable by the &s;ourne&s;s and au|&s;terity
of their manners, and by their aver&s;ion to all plea&s;ure
and &s;ociety<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Dugdale, p. 2.</NOTE>. To in&s;pire them with better humour, was
certainly, both for their own &s;ake and that of the public,
a very laudable intention in the court; but whether pillo|ries,
fines, and pri&s;ons, were proper expedients for that
purpo&s;e, may admit of &s;ome que&s;tion.</P>
<P>ANOTHER expedient which the King tried, in order to
infu&s;e chearfulne&s;s into the national devotion, was not much
more &s;ucce&s;sful. He renewed his father's edict for allowing
<PB N="238" REF="280">
&s;ports and recreations on Sunday to &s;uch as attended, public
wor&s;hip; and he ordered, his proclamation for that purpo&s;e
to be publicly read by the clergy after divine &s;ervice<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Ru&s;hworth, vol. ii. p. 193, 459. Whitlocke, p. 16, 17. Frankly$, p. 437.</NOTE>. Tho&s;e
who were puritanically affected, refu&s;ed obedience, and were
puni&s;hed by &s;u&s;pen&s;ion or deprivation. The differences be|tween
the &s;ects were before &s;ufficiently great; nor was it
nece&s;&s;ary to widen them farther by the&s;e inventions.</P>
<P>SOME encouragement and protection, which the King
and the bi&s;hops gave to wakes, church-ales, bride-ales, and
other chearful fe&s;tivals of the common people, were the ob|jects
of like &s;candal to the puritans<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Ru&s;hworth, vol. ii. p. 191, 192, May, p. 24.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THIS year,<NOTE PLACE="marg">12. June.</NOTE> Charles made a journey into Scotland, at|tended
by his court, in order to hold a parliament there, and
to pa&s;s thro' the ceremony of his coronation. The nobility
and gentry of both kingdoms rivaled each other, in expre&s;|&s;ing
all duty and re&s;pect to the King, and in &s;howing mu|tual
friend&s;hip and regard to each other. No one could
have &s;u&s;pected, from exterior appearances, that &s;uch dreadful
&s;cenes were approaching.</P>
<P>ONE chief article of bu&s;ine&s;s (for it de&s;erves the name),
which the King tran&s;acted in this parliament, was, be&s;ides
the obtaining &s;ome &s;upply, to procure authority for order|ing
the habits of clergymen<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Ru&s;h. ibid, p. 183.</NOTE>. The act pa&s;&s;ed not without
oppo&s;ition and difficulty. The dreadful &s;urplice was before
mens eyes; and they apprehended, with &s;ome rea&s;on, that,
under &s;anction of this law, it would &s;oon be introduced
among them. Tho' the King believed that his prerogative
intitled him to a general power of directing whatever be|longed
to the exterior government of the church; this was
e&s;teemed a matter of too great importance to be ordered
without the &s;anction of a particular &s;tatute.</P>
<P><PB N="239" REF="281">
IMMEDIATELY after the King's return to England, he
heard of Archbi&s;hop Abbot's death: And, without delay,
he conferred that dignity on his favourite, Laud; who, by
this acce&s;&s;ion of authority, was now enabled to maintain ec|cle&s;ia&s;tical
di&s;cipline with greater rigour, and to aggravate
the general di&s;content of the nation.</P>
<P>LAUD obtained the bi&s;hopric of London for his friend
Juxon; and, about a year after Portland's death, had in|tere&s;t
enough to engage the King to make that prelate lord
high trea&s;urer. Juxon was a per&s;on of great integrity,
mildne&s;s, and humanity, and endued with a good under|&s;tanding
<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Whitlocke, p. 23. Clarendon, vol. i. p. 99.</NOTE>. Yet did this la&s;t promotion give general di&s;|content.
His birth and character were too ob&s;cure for a
man rai&s;ed to one of the highe&s;t offices of the crown. And
the clergy, it was thought, were already too much elated
by former in&s;tances of the King's attachment to them, and
needed not this farther encouragement to a&s;&s;ume dominion
over the laity<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Clarendon, vol. i. p. 97. May, p. 23.</NOTE>. The puritans, likewi&s;e, were much di&s;&s;a|tisfied
with Juxon, notwith&s;tanding all his eminent virtues;
because he was a lover of profane field-&s;ports and hunting.</P>
<P>SHIP-MONEY was now introduced.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1634.</NOTE> The fir&s;t writs of
this kind had been only directed to &s;ea-port-towns: But
&s;hip-money was at this time levied on the whole kingdom;
and each county was rated at a particular &s;um,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ship-money.</NOTE> which was
afterwards a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed upon individuals<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Ru&s;hworth, vol. ii. p. 257, 258, &amp;c.</NOTE>. The amount of the
whole tax was very moderate, little exceeding 200,000
pounds; it was levied upon the people with ju&s;tice and
equality; and this money was intirely expended upon the
navy, to the great honour and advantage of the kingdom:
Yet all the&s;e circum&s;tances could not reconcile the people to
the impo&s;ition. It was intirely arbitrary: By the &s;ame right
any other tax might be impo&s;ed: And men e&s;teemed a power|ful
<PB N="240" REF="282">
fleet, tho' very de&s;ireable, both for the credit and &s;ecu|rity
of the kingdom, but an unequal recompence for their
liberties, which were thus &s;acrificed to the obtaining it.</P>
<P>ENGLAND, it mu&s;t be owned, was, in this re&s;pect, un|happy
in its pre&s;ent &s;ituation, that the King had entertained
a very different idea of the con&s;titution, from that which
<HI>began,</HI> in general, to prevail among his &s;ubjects. He did
not regard the privileges of the people as &s;o &s;acred and in|violable,
that nothing but the mo&s;t extreme nece&s;&s;ity could
ju&s;tify an infringement of them. He con&s;idered him&s;elf as
the &s;upreme magi&s;trate, to who&s;e care heaven, by his
birth-right, had committed his people, who&s;e duty it was
to provide for their &s;ecurity and happine&s;s, and who was
ve&s;ted with very ample di&s;cretionary powers for that &s;alutary
purpo&s;e. If the ob&s;ervance of the antient laws and cu&s;toms
was con&s;i&s;tent with the pre&s;ent convenience of government;
he thought him&s;elf obliged to comply with that rule; as
the ea&s;ie&s;t, the &s;afe&s;t, and what procured the mo&s;t prompt
and willing obedience. But when a change of circum&s;tances;
e&s;pecially if derived from the ob&s;tinacy of the people, re|quired
a new plan of admini&s;tration; national privileges,
he thought, mu&s;t yield to &s;upreme power; nor could any
order of the &s;tate oppo&s;e any right to the will of the &s;ove|reign,
directed to the good of the public<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Ru&s;hworth, vol. iv, P. 535, 542.</NOTE>. That the&s;e
principles of government were derived from the uniform
tenor of the Engli&s;h laws, it would be ra&s;h to affirm. The
fluctuating nature of the con&s;titution, the impatient hu|mour
of the people, and the variety of events, had, no
doubt, in different ages, produced many exceptions and
contradictions. The&s;e ob&s;ervations alone may be e&s;tabli&s;hed
on both &s;ides, <HI>that</HI> the appearances were &s;ufficiently &s;trong
in favour of the King to apologize for his following &s;uch
maxims, and <HI>that</HI> public liberty mu&s;t be &s;o precarious under
<PB N="241" REF="283">
this exorbitant prerogative, as to render an oppo&s;ition not
only excu&s;eable, but laudable, in the people.</P>
<P>SOME laws had been enacted, during the reign of
Henry VII. again&s;t depopulation, or the converting arable
lands into pa&s;ture. By a decree of the &s;tar-chamber, Sir
Anthony Roper was fined 4000 pounds for an offence of
this nature<NOTE N="w" PLACE="foot">Ru&s;h. vol. ii. p. 270. Vol. iii. App. p. 106</NOTE>. This &s;evere &s;entence was intended to terrify
others into compo&s;ition; and above 30,000 pounds were
levied by that expedient<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Idem, vol. iii; p. 333. Franklyn, p. 478</NOTE>. Like compo&s;itions, or, in de|fault
of them, heavy fines, were required for encroachments
on the King's fore&s;ts; who&s;e bounds, by decrees e&s;teemed
arbitrary, were extended much beyond what was u&s;ual<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">May, p. 16.</NOTE>.

<P>ALLISON had reported, that the Archbi&s;hop of York
had incurred the King's di&s;plea&s;ure, by a&s;king a limited
toleration to the catholics, and an allowance to build &s;ome
churches for the exerci&s;e of their religion. For this &s;lander
again&s;t the Archbi&s;hop, he was condemned in the &s;tar-chamber
to be fined 1000 pounds, to be committed to pri|&s;on,
to be bound to his good behaviour during life, to be
whipped, and to be &s;et on die pillory at We&s;tmin&s;ter, and
in three other towns in England. Robins, who had been

an accomplice in the guilt, was condemned by a &s;entence
equally &s;evere<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Ru&s;hworth, vol. ii. p. 269</NOTE>. Such events are rather to be con&s;idered
as rare and detached in&s;tances, collected by the &s;evere &s;cru|tiny
of hi&s;torians, than as proofs of the prevailing genius
of the King's admini&s;tration. And it is al&s;o certain, that
&s;candal again&s;t the great, tho' &s;eldom pro&s;ecuted at pre&s;ent,
is, however, in the eye of the law, a great crime, and &s;ub|jects
the offender to very heavy penalties.</P>
<P>THERE are other in&s;tances of the high re&s;pect paid
to the nobility and to the great in that age; when the
powers of monarchy, tho' di&s;puted, &s;till maintained them|&s;elves
in their pri&s;tine vigour. Clarendon<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Life of Clarendon, vol. i. p. 72.</NOTE> tells us a plea&s;ant
incident to this purpo&s;e: A waterman, belonging to a man
of quality, having a &s;quabble with a citizen about his fare,
&s;howed his badge, the cre&s;t of his ma&s;ter, which happened
to be a &s;wan; and thence in&s;i&s;ted on better treatment from
the citizen. But the other replied carele&s;sly, that he did
not trouble his head about that goo&s;e. For this offence, he
was &s;ummoned before the mar&s;hal's court; was fined, as
having opprobriou&s;ly defamed the nobleman's cre&s;t, by call|ing
the &s;wan a goo&s;e, and was in effect reduced to ruin.</P>
<P>SIR Richard Granville had been very ill u&s;ed by the Earl
of Suffolk in a law-&s;uit; and he was accu&s;ed before the
&s;tar-chamber of having &s;aid of that nobleman, that he was
a ba&s;e lord. The evidence again&s;t him was &s;omewhat weak;
yet for this &s;light offence, in&s;ufficiently proved, he was con|demned
to pay a fine of 8000 pounds; one half to the
Earl, another to the King<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Lord Lan&s;down, p. 514.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>SIR George Markham, following a chace where the
Lord Darcy's hunt&s;man was exerci&s;ing his hounds, kept
clo&s;er to the dogs than was thought proper by the
hunt&s;man, who, be&s;ides other rudene&s;s, gave him foul
language, which Sir George returned with a &s;troke of
his whip. The fellow threatened to complain to his ma&s;|ter
<PB N="243" REF="285">
The Knight replied, If his ma&s;ter would ju&s;tify &s;uch
in&s;olence, he would &s;erve him in the &s;ame manner, or words
to that effect. Sir George was cited to the &s;tar-chamber,
and fined 10,000 pounds. <HI>So fine a thing was it in tho&s;e
days to be a lord!</HI>&mdash;A very natural reflection of Lord Lan&s;|down's,
in relating this incident<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Lord Lan&s;down, p. 515.</NOTE>. The people, in vindi|cating
their liberties from the authority of the crown, threw
off al&s;o the yoke of the nobility. It is proper to remark,
that this la&s;t affair happened early in the reign of James.
The pre&s;ent practice of the &s;tar-chamber was no inno|vation;
though the pre&s;ent di&s;po&s;itions of the people made
them repine more at this grievous &s;ervitude.</P>
<P>CHARLES had imitated the example of Elizabeth and
James,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1635.</NOTE> and had i&s;&s;ued proclamations forbidding the landed
gentlemen and the nobility to live idly in London, and or|dering
them to retire to their country-feats<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Ru&s;hworth, vol. ii. p. 144.</NOTE>. For di&s;obe|dience
to this edict, many were indicted by the attorney|general,
and were fined in the &s;tar-chamber<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Idem ibid ii. p. 288.</NOTE>. This occa|&s;ioned
di&s;contents; and the &s;entences were complained of, as
illegal. But if proclamations had authority, of which no|body
pretended to doubt, mu&s;t they not be put in execu|tion?
In no in&s;tance, I mu&s;t confe&s;s, does it more evidently
appear, what confu&s;ed and uncertain ideas were, during
that age, entertained concerning the Engli&s;h con&s;titution.</P>
<P>RAY, having exported fullers-earth, contrary to the King's
proclamation, was, be&s;ides the pillory, condemned in the
&s;tar-chamber to a fins of 2000 pounds<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Idem ibid. p. 348.</NOTE>. Like fines were
levied on Terry, Eman, and others, for di&s;obeying a pro|clamation
which forbad the exportation of gold<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Idem ibid. p. 350.</NOTE>. In order
to account for the &s;ub&s;equent convul&s;ions, even the&s;e in|cidents
are not to be overlooked, as frivolous or contempti|ble.
Such &s;everities as the&s;e were afterwards magnified
into the greate&s;t enormities.</P>

THERE remains a proclamation of this year, prohibiting
hackney coaches to &s;tand in the &s;treet<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Ru&s;hworth, vol. ii. p. 316.</NOTE>. We are told, that
there were not above twenty coaches of that kind in Lon|don.

<P>THE effects of &s;hip-money began now to appear.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1636.</NOTE> A
formidable &s;leet of &s;ixty &s;ail, the greate&s;t which England
had ever known, was equipped under the Earl of Northum|berland,
who had orders to attack the herring bu&s;&s;es of the
Dutch, which fi&s;hed in what were called the Briti&s;h &s;eas.
The Dutch were content to pay 30,000 pounds for a licence
during this year. They openly denied however, this claim
of dominion in the &s;eas, beyond the friths, bays, and &s;hores;
and it may be que&s;tioned whether the laws of nations war|rant
any farther preten&s;ions.</P>

and even the Engli&s;h coa&s;ts had been long infe&s;ted. This
&s;mall exploit was of con&s;equence, and the utmo&s;t that could
be expected from a prince who had no army nor revenue;
and who had not been able, without employing the mo&s;t
difficult and even dangerous expedients, to equip a fleet,
and thereby provide in &s;ome degree for the reputation and
&s;afety of his kingdoms.</P>
<P>BURTON a divine,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1637.</NOTE> and Ba&s;twick a phy&s;ician, were tried
in the star-chamber for &s;editious and &s;chi&s;matical libels, and

inflicted on Prynne. Prynne, him&s;elf was tried for a new
offence; and, together with another fine of 5,000 pounds,
was condemned to lo&s;e what remained of his ears. Be&s;ides,
that the&s;e writers had attacked, with great &s;everity, and even
an intemperate zeal, the ceremonies, rites, and government
<PB N="245" REF="287">
of the church; the very an&s;wers, which they gave in to the
court, were &s;o full of contumacy and of invectives again&s;t
the prelates, that no lawyer could be prevailed with to &s;ign
them<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Ru&s;h. vol. ii. p. 381, 382, &amp;c. State Trials, vol. v. p. 66.</NOTE>. The rigors, however, which they underwent, be|ing
&s;o unworthy men of their profe&s;&s;ion, gave general of|fence;
and the patience, or rather alacrity, with which they
&s;uffered, increa&s;ed &s;till farther the indignation of the public<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">State Trials, vol. v. p. 80.</NOTE>. The &s;everity of the &s;tar-chamber, which was generally a&s;cribed to Laud's pa&s;&s;ionate di&s;po&s;ition, was perhaps, in it|&s;elf,
&s;omewhat blameable; but will naturally, to us, appear
enormous, who enjoy, in the utmo&s;t latitude, that liberty
of the pre&s;s, which is &s;o nece&s;&s;ary in every monarchy, con|fined
by legal limitations. But as the&s;e limitations were not
regularly fixed during the age of Charles, nor at any time
before; &s;o was the freedom of &s;peech totally unknown, and
was generally deemed, as well as religious toleration, incom|patible
with all good government. No age nor nation, among the moderns,
had ever &s;et an example of &s;uch an in|dulgence:
And it &s;eems unrea&s;onable to judge of the mea|&s;ures,
embraced during one period, by the maxims which
prevail in another.</P>
<P>BURTON, in his book where he complained of innova|tions,
mentioned, among others, that a certain Wedne&s;day
had been appointed for a fa&s;t, and that the fa&s;t was ordered
to be celebrated without any &s;ermons<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 74. Franklyn, p. 839.</NOTE>. The intention, as
he pretended, of that novelty, was, by the example of a
fa&s;t without &s;ermons, to &s;uppre&s;s all the Wedne&s;day's lectures
in London. 'Tis ob&s;ervable, that the church of Rome and
that of England, being, both of them, lovers of form and
ceremony and order, are more friends to prayer than preach|ing;
while the puritanical &s;ectaries, who find that the lat|ter
method of addre&s;s, being directed to a numerous audi|ence
pre&s;ent and vi&s;ible, is more inflaming and animating,
<PB N="246" REF="288">
have always regarded it as the chief part of divine &s;ervice.
Such circum&s;tances, tho' minute, it may not be improper
to tran&s;mit to po&s;cerity; that tho&s;e, who are curious of
tracing the hi&s;tory of the human mind, may remark, how
far its &s;everal &s;ingularities coincide in different ages.</P>
<P>CERTAIN zealots had erected them&s;elves into a &s;ociety
for buying in of impropriations, and transferring them to
the church; and great &s;ums of money had been bequeathed
to the &s;ociety for the&s;e purpo&s;es. But it was &s;oon ob&s;erved,
that the only u&s;e which they made of their funds, was, to
e&s;tabli&s;h lecturers in all the considerable churches; men,
who, without being &s;ubjected to epi&s;copal authority, em|ployed
them&s;elves intirely in preaching and in &s;preading the
fire of puritani&s;m, Laud took care, by a decree which was
pa&s;&s;ed in the court of exchequer, and which was much
complained of, to aboli&s;h this &s;ociety, and to &s;top their pro|gre&s;s<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Ru&s;hworth, vol. ii. p. 15$, 15$. Whitlecke, p. 15. Hi&s;tory of the $word$ and $word$ of Land, p. $word$, 212.</NOTE>.
It was, however, &s;till ob&s;erved, that, throughout
England, the lecturers were all of them puritanically af|fected;
and from them the clergymen, who contented them|&s;elves
with reading prayers and homilies to the people, com|monly
received the reproachful appellation of <HI>dumb dogs.</HI></P>
<P>THE puritans, re&s;trained in England, &s;hipped them&s;elves
off for America, and laid there the foundations of a govern|ment,
which po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed all the liberty, both civil and reli|gious,
of which they found them&s;elves deprived in their
native country. But their enemies, unwilling that they
&s;hould any-where enjoy ca&s;e and contentment, and dreading,
perhaps, the dangerous con&s;equences of &s;o di&s;affected a co|lony,
prevailed with the King to i&s;&s;ue a proclamation, de|barring
the&s;e devotees acce&s;s even into tho&s;e inho&s;pitable
de&s;erts<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Ru&s;h, vol. ii. p. 409. $word$.</NOTE>. Eight &s;hips, lying in the Thames, and ready

embarked Sir Arthur Hazelrig, John Hambden, and Oliver
Cromwel<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Mather's Hi&s;tory of New England, book 1. Dugdale. Bates.</NOTE>, who had re&s;olved for ever to abandon their na|tive
country, and fly to the other extremity of the globe;
where they might enjoy lectures and di&s;cour&s;es of any length
or form which plea&s;ed them. The King had afterwards
full lei&s;ure to repent this exerci&s;e of his authority.</P>
<P>THE bi&s;hop of Norwich, by rigorou&s;ly in&s;i&s;ting on uni|formity,
had bani&s;hed many indu&s;trious trade&s;men from
that city, and chaced them into Holland<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">May, p. 82.</NOTE>. The Dutch
began to be more intent on commerce than on orthodoxy; and
thought that u&s;eful arts and obedience to the laws formed a
good citizen; tho' attended with errors in &s;ubjects, where
it is not allowable for human nature to expect any po&s;itive
truth or certainty.</P>
<P>COMPLAINTS about this time were made, that the peti|tion
of right was, in &s;ome in&s;tances, violated, and that,
upon a commitment by the King and council, bail or re|lea&s;ement

Danvers<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Ru&s;h, vol. ii. p. 414.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>WILLIAMS, bi&s;hop of Lincoln, a man of great &s;pirit
and learning, a very popular prelate, and who had been
lord keeper, was fined 10,000 pounds, committed to the
Tower during the King's plea&s;ure, and &s;u&s;pended from his
office. This &s;evere &s;entence was founded on very frivolous
pretences, and was more a&s;cribed to Laud's vengeance, than
to any guilt of the bi&s;hop<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Idem ibid. p. 416, &amp;c.</NOTE>. Laud, however, had owed
his fir&s;t promotion intirely to the good offices of that pre|late
with King James. But &s;o implacable was the haughty
primate, that he rai&s;ed up a, new pro&s;ecution again&s;t Wil|liams,
on the &s;trange&s;t pretence imaginable. In order to
levy the fine above-mentioned, &s;ome officers had been &s;ent
to &s;eize all the furniture and books of his epi&s;copal palace
of Lincoln; and in rummaging the hou&s;e, they found in a
<PB N="248" REF="290">
corner &s;ome neglected letters, which had been thrown by,
as u&s;ele&s;s. The&s;e letters were wrote by one O&s;baldi&s;tone,
a &s;choolma&s;ter, and were directed to Williams. Mention
was there made of <HI>a little great man;</HI> and in another pa&s;|&s;age,
the &s;ame per&s;on was denominated <HI>a little urchin.</HI> By
inferences and con&s;tructions, the&s;e epithets were applied to
Laud; and on no better foundation was Williams tried anew,
as having received &s;candalous letters, and not di&s;covering
that private corre&s;pondence. For this offence, another fine
of 8000 pounds was levied on him by a &s;entence of the
&s;tar-chamber: O&s;baldi&s;tone was likewi&s;e brought to trial,
and condemned to pay a fine of 5000 pounds, and to have
his ears nailed to the pillory before his own &s;chool. He
&s;aved him&s;elf by flight; and left a note in his &s;tudy, where
he &s;aid, &startq;That he was gone beyond Canterbury<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Ru&s;h. vol. ii. p. 803, &amp;c. Whitlocke, p. 25.</NOTE>.&endq;</P>
<P>THESE pro&s;ecutions of Williams &s;eem to be the mo&s;t ini|quitous
mea&s;ure, pur&s;ued by the court during the time that
the u&s;e of parliaments were &s;u&s;pended. Williams was a
man who had been indebted for all his fortune to the favour
of James; but having quarreled, fir&s;t with Buckingham,
then with Laud, he threw him&s;elf into the country party;
and with great firmne&s;s and vigour oppo&s;ed all the mea&s;ures
of the King. A creature of the court to become its ob&s;ti|nate
enemy, a bi&s;hop to countenance paritans; the&s;e cir|cum&s;tances
excited indignation, and engaged the mini&s;ters
in the&s;e &s;evere mea&s;ures. Not to mention, what &s;ome
writers relate, that, before the &s;entence was pronounced
again&s;t him, Williams was offered a pardon upon his &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion,
which he refu&s;ed to make. The court was apt to
think, that &s;o re$ractory a &s;pirit mu&s;t by any expedient be
broken and &s;ubdued.</P>
<P>IN a format trial, which Williams underwent<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Ru&s;h. vol. ii. p. 416.</NOTE> (for the&s;e
were not the fir&s;t) there was mentioned, in court, a &s;tory,
<PB N="249" REF="291">
which, as it di&s;covers the genius of parties, may be worth
reciting. Sir John Lambe, urging him to pro&s;ecute the
puritans, the prelate a&s;ked, what &s;ort of people the&s;e &s;ame
puritans were? Sir John replied, &startq;That to the world they
&s;eemed to be &s;uch as would not &s;wear, whore, nor-be
drunk; but they would lye, cozen, and deceive: That
they would frequently hear two &s;ermons a-day, and re|peat
them too, and that &s;ometimes they would fa&s;t all day
long.&endq; This character mu&s;t be conceived to be &s;atiri|cal;
but yet, it may be allowed, that that &s;ect was more
aver&s;e to &s;uch irregularities as proceed from the exce&s;s of
gaiety and plea&s;ure, than to tho&s;e enormities, which are
the mo&s;t de&s;tructive of &s;ociety. The former were oppo&s;ite
to the very genius and &s;pirit of their religion; the latter
were only a tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion of its precepts: And it was not
difficult for a gloomy enthu&s;ia&s;t to convince him&s;elf, that a
&s;trict ob&s;ervance of the one would attone for any violation
of the other.</P>
<P>IN 1632, Lord trea&s;urer Portland had in&s;i&s;ted with the
vintners, that they &s;hould &s;ubmit to a tax of a penny a quart,
upon all the wine which they retailed. But this propo&s;al
they utterly refu&s;ed. In order to puni&s;h them, a decree
&s;uddenly, without enquiry or examination, pa&s;&s;ed in the
&s;tar-chamber, prohibiting them to &s;ell or dre&s;s victuals
in their hou&s;es<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Ru&s;h. vol. ii. p. 197.</NOTE>. Two years after, they Were que&s;tioned
for the breach of this decree; and in order to avoid pu|ni&s;hment,
they agreed to lend the King &s;ix thou&s;and pounds.
Being threatened, during the &s;ub&s;equent years, with fines
and pro&s;ecutions, they at la&s;t compounded thb matter, and
&s;ubmitted to pay half the duty, which was at fir&s;t demand|ed
of them<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Idem ibid. p. 451.</NOTE>. It required little forefight to perceive, that
the King's right of i&s;&s;uing proclamations mu&s;t, if pro&s;e|cuted,
draw on a power of taxation.</P>

LILBURNE was accu&s;ed before the &s;tar-chamber, of

in that court, that he would an&s;wer interrogatories, by
which he might be led to accu&s;e him&s;elf. For this con|tempt,
as it was interpreted, he was condemned to be
whipped, pilloried, and impri&s;oned. While he was whipped
at the cart, and &s;tood on the pillory, he harangued the po|pulace,
and declaimed violently again&s;t the tyranny of bi|&s;hops
From his pockets al&s;o he &s;cattered pamphlets, &s;aid
to be &s;editious; becau&s;e they attacked the hierarchy. The
&s;tar-chamber, who were &s;itting at that very time, ordered
him immediately to be gagged. He cea&s;ed not, however,
though both gagged and pilloried, to &s;tamp with his foot
and ge&s;ticulate, in order to &s;how the people, that, if he had
it in his power, he would &s;till harangue them. This be|haviour
gave fre&s;h provocation to the &s;tar-chamber; and

<P>THE jealou&s;y of the church appeared in another in&s;tance
le&s;s tragical. Archy, the King's fool, who, by his office,
had the privilege of je&s;ting on his ma&s;ter, and the whole
court, happened unluckily to try his wit upon Laud, who
was too &s;acred a per&s;on to be played with. News having
arrived from Scotland of the fir&s;t commotions excited by
the liturgy, Archy, &s;eeing the primate pa&s;s by, called to
him, <HI>Who's fool, now, my Lord?</HI> For this offence, Archy

he might impo&s;e that taxation, and that he was
&s;ole judge of the nece&s;&s;ity<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Idem, vol. ii. p. 355. Whitlocke, p. 24.</NOTE>&endq; Mr. Hambden had been
rated at twenty &s;hillings for an e&s;tate, which he held in the
<PB N="252" REF="294">
county of Buckingham: Yet notwith&s;tanding this declared
opinion of the judges, notwith&s;tanding the great power,
and &s;ometimes rigorous maxims of the crown, notwith&s;tand|ing
the little pro&s;pect of relief from parliament; he re|&s;olved,
rather than tamely &s;ubmit to &s;o illegal an impo&s;i|tion,
to &s;tand a legal pro&s;ecution, and expo&s;e himfelf to all
the indignation of the court. The ca&s;e was argued during
twelve days, in the exchequer-chamber, before all the
judges of England; and the nation regarded, with the ut|mo&s;t
anxiety, every circum&s;tance of this celebrated trial.
The event was ea&s;ily fore&s;een: But the principles, and
rea&s;onings, and behaviour of all the parties, engaged in the
trial, were much canva&s;&s;ed and enquired into; and nothing
could equal the favour paid to the one &s;ide, except the
hatred which attended the other.</P>
<P>IT was urged by Hambden's council, that the plea of ne|ce&s;&s;ity
was in vain introduced into a trial of law; &s;ince it was the
nature of nece&s;&s;ity to aboli&s;h all law, and, by irre&s;i&s;tible
violence, to di&s;&s;olve all the weaker and more artificial ties
of human &s;ociety. Not only the prince, in ca&s;es of ex|treme
di&s;tre&s;s, is exempted from the ordinary rules of ad|mini&s;tration:
All orders of men are then levelled; and any
individual may con&s;ult the public &s;afety by any expedient,
which his &s;ituation enables him to employ. But to pro|duce
&s;o violent an effect, and &s;o hazardous to every community,
an ordinary danger or difficulty is not &s;ufficient;
much le&s;s, a nece&s;&s;ity, which is merely factitious and pre|tended.
Where the peril is urgent and extreme, it will be
palpable to every member of the &s;ociety; and though all
antient rules of government are in that ca&s;e abrogated, men
will readily, of them&s;elves, &s;ubmit to that irregular autho|rity,
which is exerted for their pre&s;ervation. But what is
there in common between &s;uch &s;uppo&s;itions, and the pre|&s;ent
condition of the nation? England enjoys a profound
peace with all her neighbours: And what is more, all her
neighbours are engaged in furious and bloody wars among
<PB N="253" REF="295">
them&s;elves, and by their mutual enmities farther en&s;ure her
tranquillity. The very writs them&s;elves, which are i&s;&s;ued for
the levying of &s;hip-money, contradict the &s;uppo&s;ition of ne|ce&s;&s;ity,
and pretend only, that the &s;eas are in&s;e&s;ted with py|rates;
a &s;light and temporary inconvenience, which may
well wait a legal &s;upply from parliament. The writs like|wife
allow &s;everal months for equipping the &s;hips; which
proves a very calm and deliberate &s;pecics of nece&s;&s;ity, and
one that admits of delay much beyond the &s;orty days requi&s;i|te
for &s;ummoning that a&s;&s;embly. 'Tis &s;trange too, that
an extreme nece&s;&s;ity, which is always apparent, and u&s;ually
comes to a &s;udden cri&s;is, &s;hould now have continued, with|out
interruption, for near four years, and &s;hould have re|mained,
during &s;o long a time, invi&s;ible to the whole king|dom.
And as to the preten&s;ion, that the King is &s;ole
judge of the nece&s;&s;ity; what is this, but to &s;ubject: all the
privileges of the nation to his arbitrary will and plea&s;ure?
To expect that the public will be convinced by &s;uch rea&s;on|ing,
mu&s;t aggravate the general indignation; by adding, to
violence again&s;t mens per&s;ons, and their property, &s;o cruel a
mockery their under&s;tanding.</P>
<P>IN mo&s;t national debates, though the rea&s;ons may not be
equally ballanced, yet are there commonly &s;ome plau&s;ible
topics, which may be pleaded even in favour of the weaker
&s;ide;&s;o complicated are all human affairs, and &s;o uncer|tain;
the views, which give ri&s;e to every public mea&s;ure:
But it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, that, in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, no legal
topics of any weight can be thrown into the oppo&s;ite &s;cale.
The impo&s;ition of &s;hip-money, is apparently one of the mo&s;t
dangerous inva&s;ions of national privileges, not only which
Charles was ever guilty of, but which the mo&s;t arbitrary
prince in England, &s;ince any liberty had been a&s;certained to
the people, had ventured upon<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">It mu&s;t, however, be allowed, that Queen Elizabeth ordered the &s;ea|ports to fit out &s;hips at their own expence during the time of the Spani&s;h in|va&s;ion. <HI>Mon&s;ou's Naval Tracts.</HI></NOTE> In vainwere precedents
<PB N="254" REF="296">
of antient writs produced: The&s;e writs, when examined, were
only found to require the &s;ea-ports, &s;ometimes at their own
charge, &s;ometimes at the charge of the counties, to &s;end their
&s;hips for the defence of the nation. Even the prerogative,
which empowered the crown to i&s;&s;ue &s;uch writs, was aboli&s;h|ed,
and its exerci&s;e almo&s;t intirely di&s;continued, from the time
of Edward III.<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">State Trials, vol. v. p. 245, 255.</NOTE> and all the authority, which remained or
was afterwards exerci&s;ed, was to pre&s;s &s;hips into the public
&s;ervice, to be payed for by the public. How wide were
the&s;e precedents from a power of arbitrarily obliging the
people, at their own charge, to build new &s;hips, to victual
and pay them, for the public; nay, to furni&s;h money to
the crown for that purpo&s;e? What &s;ecurity either again&s;t
the farther exten&s;ion of this claim, or again&s;t employing to
other purpo&s;es the public money, &s;o levied? The plea of
nece&s;&s;ity would warrant any other taxation as well as that
of &s;hip-money; and it was difficult to conceive the king|dom
in a &s;ituation, where that plea could be urged with
le&s;s plau&s;ibility than at pre&s;ent. And if &s;uch maxims and
&s;uch practices prevail; what has become of national liberty?
What authority is left to the great charter, to the &s;tatutes,
and to that very petition of right, which in the pre&s;ent
reign, had been &s;olemnly enacted, by the concurrence of
the whole legi&s;lature?</P>
<P>NOTWITHSTANDING all the&s;e rea&s;ons, the prejudiced or
pro&s;tituted judges, four<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">See State Trials: Article, &s;hip money, which contains the &s;peeches of four judges, in favour of Hambden.</NOTE> excepted, gave &s;entence in favour of
the crown<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">The power of taxing them&s;elves is an undoubted and mo&s;t important privilege of the people of England. The only apology, which could be made for the King in impo&s;ing &s;hip-money, is derived from a topic, which could not ju&s;tly be admitted by any court of judicature; that all the privileges of the people were &s;o far &s;ubordinate to royal prerogative, that in ca&s;es of nece&s;&s;ity they might lawfully be di&s;pen&s;ed with. Such a doctrine may be tolerable, where the nece&s;&s;ity is &s;uppo&s;ed evident, extreme, and inevitable. But the King thought, that a le&s;s nece&s;&s;ity, if it proceeded from the ob&s;tinacy of the people, might warrant this extraordinary exertion of prerogative: A principle, it mu&s;t be owned, very dangerous to national liberty, and &s;uch as no lawyer ought to be allowed to plead. What|ever therefore may be advanced in excu&s;e for the King, nothing rea&s;onable can be &s;aid in favour of the judges.</NOTE> Hambden, however, obtained by the trial the
<PB N="255" REF="297">
end, for which he had &s;o generou&s;ly &s;acrificed his &s;afety and
his quiet: The people were rouzed from their lethargy,
and became &s;en&s;ible of the danger, to which their liberty
was expo&s;ed. The&s;e national que&s;tions were canva&s;&s;ed in
every company; and the more they were examined, the
more evidently did it appear to many, that liberty was to|tally
&s;ubverted, and an unu&s;ual and arbitrary authority ex|erci&s;ed
over the kingdom. Slavi&s;h principles, they &s;aid,
concurred with illegal practices; eccle&s;ia&s;tical tyranny gave
aid to civil u&s;urpation; iniquitous taxes were &s;upported by
arbitrary puni&s;hments; and all the rights of the nation,
tran&s;mitted through, &s;o many ages, &s;ecured by &s;o many laws,
and purcha&s;ed by the blood of &s;o many heroes and patriots,
now lay pro&s;trate at the feet of the monarch. What tho'
public peace and national indu&s;try encrea&s;ed the commerce
and opulence of the kingdom? This advantage was temp|orary,
and due alone, not to any encouragement given by
the crown, but to the &s;pirit of the Engli&s;h, the remains of
their antient freedom. What though the per&s;onal charac|ter
of the King, amid&s;t all his mi&s;guided councils, might
merit indulgence, or even prai&s;e? He was but one man;
and the privileges of the nation, the inheritance of millions,
were too valuable to be &s;acrificed to his prejudices and mi&s;|takes.
Such, or more &s;evere, were the &s;entiments promoted
by a great party in the nation: No excu&s;e on the King's
part, or alleviation, however rea&s;onable, could be hearkened
to or admitted: And to redre&s;s the&s;e grievances, a par|liament
was impatiently longed for; or any other incident,
however calamitous, which might &s;ecure the people again&s;t,
tho&s;e oppre&s;&s;ions, which they felt, or the greater ills, which
they apprehended, from the combined encroachments of
church and &s;tate.

<P>THE grievances, under which the Engli&s;h laboured,
when con&s;idered in them&s;elves, without regard to
the con&s;titution, &s;carce de&s;erve the name; nor were they
either burthen&s;ome on the people's properties, or any way
&s;hocking to the natural humanity of mankind. Even the
taxation of &s;hip-money, independent of the con&s;equences,
was rather an advantage to the public; by the judicious
u&s;e, which the King made of the money levied by that
expedient. And though it was ju&s;tly apprehended that &s;uch
precedents, if patiently &s;ubmitted to, would end in a total
di&s;u&s;e of parliaments, and in the e&s;tablishment of arbitrary
authority; Charles dreaded no oppo&s;ition from the people,
who are not commonly much affected with con&s;equences,
and require &s;ome &s;triking motive, to engage them into
a re&s;i&s;tance of e&s;tabli&s;hed government. All eccle&s;ia&s;ti|cal
affairs Were &s;ettled by law and uninterrupted prece|dent;
and the church was become a con&s;iderable barrier
to the power, both legal and illegal, of the crown. Peace
too, indu&s;try, commerce, opulence; nay, even ju&s;tice and
lenity of admini&s;tration, notwith&s;tanding &s;ome few exceptions;

All the&s;e were enjoyed by the people;<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. LIII.</NOTE> and every

&s;eemed probable, therefore, that affairs might long have
continued on the &s;ame footing in England, had it not been
for the neighbourhood of Scotland; a country more turbu|lent,
and le&s;s di&s;po&s;ed to &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion and obedience. It was
from thence the commotions fir&s;t aro&s;e; and 'tis therefore
time for us to return thither, and to give an account of the
&s;ituation of that country.</P>
<P>THOUGH the pacific,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Di&s;contents in Scotland.</NOTE> and not un&s;kilful government of
James, and the great authority, which he had acquired,
had much allayed the feuds among the great families, and
had e&s;tabli&s;hed law and order throughout the kingdom;
the Scots nobility were &s;till po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the chief power and
influence over the people. Their property was very ex|ten&s;ive;
their hereditary juri&s;dictions and the feudal tenures
increa&s;ed their authority; and the attachment of the gentry
to the heads of families e&s;tabli&s;hed a kind of voluntary &s;er|vitude
under the chieftains. Be&s;ides that long ab&s;ence had
much loo&s;ened the King's connexion with the nobility,
who re&s;ided chiefly at their country &s;eats; they were, in
general, at this time, though from &s;light cau&s;es, very much
di&s;gu&s;ted with the court. Charles, from the natural piety
or &s;uper&s;tition of his temper, was extremely attached to the
eccle&s;ia&s;tics: And as it is natural for men to per&s;uade
them&s;elves, that their intere&s;t coincides with their inclina|tion;
he had e&s;tabli&s;hed it as a fixed maxim of policy, to
increa&s;e the power and authority of that order. The pre|lates,
he thought, e&s;tabli&s;hed regularity and di&s;cipline
among the clergy; the clergy inculcated obedience and
loyalty among the people: And as that rank of men had
no &s;eparate authority, and no dependance but on the crown;
the royal power, it would &s;eem, might, with the greate&s;t
<PB N="258" REF="302">
&s;afety, be entru&s;ted in their hands. Many of the prelates,
therefore, he rai&s;ed to the chief dignities of the &s;tate<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Ru&s;h. vol. ii. p. 386. May, p. 29.</NOTE>:
Spot&s;wood, Archbi&s;hop of St. Andrew's, was created chan|cellor:
Nine of the bi&s;hops were privy coun&s;ellors: The
bi&s;hop of Ro&s;s a&s;pired to the office of trea&s;urer: Some of
the prelates po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed places in the exchequer: And it
was even endeavoured to revive the fir&s;t in&s;titution of the col|lega
of ju&s;tice, and to &s;hare equally between the clergy and
laity the whole judicial authority<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Guthry's Memoirs, p. 14. Bunet's Mem. p. 29, 30.</NOTE> The&s;e advantages,
which were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the church, and which the bi|&s;hops
did not always enjoy with &s;uitable mode&s;ty, di&s;gu&s;ted
the haughty nobility, who, deeming them&s;elves &s;o much
&s;uperior in rank and quality to this new order of men,
were di&s;plea&s;ed to find them&s;elves inferior in power and in|fluence.
Intere&s;t joined it&s;elf to ambition; and begot a
jealou&s;y, left the epi&s;copal sees, which, at the reformation,
had been pillaged by the nobles, &s;hould again be enriched
at their expence. By a mo&s;t u&s;eful and beneficial law, the
impropriations had already been ravi&s;hed from the great
men: Power had been given to a&s;&s;ign, to the impoveri&s;hed
clergy, competent livings from the tythes of each pari&s;h:
And what remained, the proprietor of the land was im|powered
to purcha&s;e at a low valuation<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">King's Declaration, p. 7. Franklyn, p. 611.</NOTE>. The King like|wife,
warranted by antient law and practice, had declared for
a general re&s;umption of all crown-lands, alienated by his
predece&s;&s;ors; and though he took no &s;tep towards the exe|cution
of this project, the very preten&s;ion to &s;uch power
had excited jealou&s;y and di&s;content<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">King's Declaration, p. 6.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>NOTWITHSTANDING the tender regard, which Charles
bore to the whole church, he had been able in Scotland, to
acquire only the affection of the &s;uperior rank among the
clergy. The mini&s;ters, in general, equalled, if not ex|ceeded
<PB N="259" REF="303">
the nobility, in their prejudices again&s;t the court,
again&s;t the prelates, and again&s;t epi&s;copal authority<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Burnet's Mem. p. 29, 30.</NOTE>.
Though the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the hierarchy might &s;eem ad|vantageous
to the inferior clergy, both as it erected digni|ties,
to which all of them might a&s;pire, and as it be&s;towed a
lu&s;tre on the whole body, and allured men of family into
it; the&s;e views had no influence on the Scots eccle&s;ia&s;tics.
In the pre&s;ent di&s;po&s;ition of mens minds, there was another
circum&s;tance, which drew con&s;ideration, and counter-bal|lanced
power and riches, the u&s;ual foundations of di&s;tinc|tion
among men; and that was, the fervour of piety, and
the rhetoric, however barbarous, of religious lectures
and di&s;cour&s;es. Checked by the prelates in the licence of preach|ing,
the clergy regarded epi&s;copal juri&s;diction both as
a tyranny and an u&s;urpation, and maintained a parity among
eccle&s;ia&s;tics to be a divine privilege, which no human law
could alter or infringe. While &s;uch ideas prevailed, the
mo&s;t moderate exerci&s;e of authority would have given di&s;|gu&s;t;
much more, that exten&s;ive power, which the King's
indulgence encouraged the prelates to a&s;&s;ume. The juri&s;|diction
of pre&s;byteries, &s;ynods, and other democratical
courts, was, in a manner, aboli&s;hed by the bi&s;hops; and the
general a&s;&s;embly it&s;elf had not been &s;ummoned for &s;everal
years<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">May, p. 29.</NOTE>. A new oath was arbitrarily exacted of intrants, by
which they &s;wore to ob&s;erve the articles of Perth, and &s;ub|mit
to the liturgy and canons. And in a word, the whole
&s;y&s;tem of church government, during a cour&s;e of $hirty
years, had been changed by means of the innovations intro|duced
by James and Charles.</P>
<P>THE people, under the influence of the nobility and
clergy, could not fail to partake of the di&s;contents, which
prevailed among the&s;e two orders; and where real grounds
of complaint were wanting, they greedily laid hold of ima|ginary
ones. The &s;ame horror again&s;t popery, with which
<PB N="260" REF="304">
the Engli&s;h puritans were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, was ob&s;ervable among
the populace in Scotland; and among the&s;e, who were more
uncultivated and uncivilized, &s;eemed rather to be inflamed
into a higher degree of ferocity. The genius of religion,
which prevailed with the court and prelacy, was of an op|po&s;ite
nature; and having &s;ome affinity with the Romi&s;h
wor&s;hip, led them to mollify, as much as po&s;&s;ible, the&s;e
&s;evere prejudices, and to &s;peak of the catholics in more cha|ritable
language, and with more reconciling expre&s;&s;ions.
From this foundation, a panic fear of popery was ea&s;ily
rai&s;ed; and every new ceremony or ornament, introduced
into divine &s;ervice, was part of that great my&s;tery of ini|quity,
which, from the encouragement of the King and
the bi&s;hops, was to over&s;pread the nation<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Burnet's Mem. p. 29, 30, 31.</NOTE>. The few innova|tions,
which James had made, were con&s;idered as prepara|tives
to this grand de&s;ign; and the farther alterations, at|tempted
by Charles, were repre&s;ented as a plain declaration
of his intentions. Through the whole cour&s;e of this reign,
nothing had more fatal influence, in both kingdoms, than
this groundle&s;s apprehen&s;ion, which, with &s;o much indu&s;|try,
was propagated, and with &s;o much credulity, was em|braced
by all ranks of men.</P>
<P>AMIDST the&s;e dangerous complaints and terrors of reli|gious
grievances, the civil and eccle&s;ia&s;tical privileges of the
nation were imagined, and with &s;ome rea&s;on, not to be al|together
free from inva&s;ion.</P>
<P>THE e&s;tabli&s;hment of the high-commi&s;&s;ion by James,
without any authority of law, &s;eemed a con&s;iderable en|croachment
of the crown; and erected the mo&s;t dangerous
and arbitrary of all courts, by a method equally dangerous
and arbitrary. All the &s;teps towards the &s;ettlement of epi&s;|copacy
had indeed been taken with con&s;ent of parliament:
The articles of Perth were confirmed in 1621: In 1633,
the King had obtained a general ratification of every eccle&s;i|a&s;tical
<PB N="261" REF="305">
e&s;tabli&s;hment: But all the&s;e laws had le&s;s authority
with the nation, as they were known to have pa&s;&s;ed con|trary
to the &s;entiments even of tho&s;e who voted for them,
and were in reality extorted by the authority and importu|nity
of the &s;overeign. The means, however, which both
James and Charles had employed, in order to influence the
parliament, were intirely regular; and no rea&s;onable pre|tence
had been afforded for repre&s;enting the&s;e laws as null or
invalid.</P>
<P>BUT there prevailed among the greate&s;t part of the nation
another principle, of the mo&s;t important and mo&s;t danger|ous
con&s;equence, and which, if admitted, de&s;troyed in|tirely
the validity of all &s;uch &s;tatutes. The eccle&s;ia&s;tical
authority was &s;uppo&s;ed to be totally independent of the
civil; and no act of parliament, nothing but the con&s;ent of
the church it&s;elf, was repre&s;ented as &s;ufficient ground for
the introduction of any change in religious wor&s;hip or di&s;|cipline.
And though James had obtained the vote of a&s;|&s;emblies
for receiving epi&s;copacy and his new rites; it mu&s;t
be confe&s;&s;ed, that &s;uch irregularities had prevailed in con|&s;tituting
the&s;e eccle&s;ia&s;tical courts, and &s;uch violences in con|ducting
them, that there were &s;ome grounds for denying the
authority of all their acts. Charles, &s;en&s;ible that an ex|torted
con&s;ent, attended with &s;uch invidious circum&s;tances,
would rather be prejudicial to his mea&s;ures, had intirely
laid a&s;ide the u&s;e of a&s;&s;emblies, and was re&s;olved, in con|junction
with the bi&s;hops, to govern the church by an au|thority,
to which he thought him&s;elf fully intitled, and which he believed ab&s;olutely uncontroulable.</P>
<P>THE King's great aim was to compleat the work, &s;o hap|pily
begun by his father, to e&s;tabli&s;h di&s;cipline upon a re|gular
&s;y&s;tem of canons, to introduce a liturgy into public
wor&s;hip, and to render the eccle&s;ia&s;tical government of all
his kingdoms intirely regular and uniform. Some views of
policy might move him to this undertaking: But the chief
<PB N="262" REF="306">
motives were derived from mi&s;taken principles of zeal and
con&s;cience.</P>
<P>THE canons for e&s;tabli&s;hing eccle&s;ia&s;tical juri&s;diction
were promulgated in 1635;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Introducti|on of the canons and liturgy.</NOTE> and were received by the na|tion,
though without much appearing oppo&s;ition, yet with
great inward apprehen&s;ion and di&s;content. Men felt di&s;|plea&s;ure,
at &s;eeing the royal authority highly exalted by them,
and repre&s;ented as ab&s;olute and uncontroulable. They &s;aw
the&s;e &s;peculative principles reduced to practice, and a whole
body of eccle&s;ia&s;tical laws e&s;tabli&s;hed, without any previous
con&s;ent either of church or &s;tate<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Clarendon, vol. i. p. 106.</NOTE>. They dreaded, that,
by a parity of rea&s;on, like arbitrary authority, from like
pretences and principles, would be a&s;&s;umed in civil matters:
They remarked, that the delicate boundaries, which &s;epa|rate
church and &s;tate, were already pa&s;&s;ed, and many civil
ordinances e&s;tabli&s;hed by the canons, under colour of ec|cle&s;ia&s;tical
in&s;titutions: And they were apt to deride the
negligence, with which the&s;e important edicts had been
compiled; when they found, that the new liturgy or &s;er|vice-book
was every where, under &s;evere penalties, en|joined
by them, though it had not yet been compo&s;ed or
publi&s;hed<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Idem ibid. p. 105.</NOTE>. It was, however, &s;oon expected; and in the
reception of it, as the people are always mo&s;t affected by
what is external and expo&s;ed to the &s;en&s;es, it was appre|hended,
that the chief difficulty would con&s;i&s;t.</P>
<P>THE liturgy, which the King, from his own authority,
impo&s;ed on Scotland, was copied from that of England:
But le&s;t a &s;ervile imitation might &s;hock the pride of his antient
kingdom, a very few alterations, in order to &s;ave appearances,
were made in it; and in that &s;hape it was tran&s;mitted to
the bi&s;hops at Edinburgh<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">King's Declaration, p. 18. May, p. 32.</NOTE>. But the Scots had univer|&s;ally
entertained a notion, that, though riches and worldly
glory had been &s;hared out to them with a &s;paring hand,
<PB N="263" REF="307">
they could boa&s;t of &s;piritual trea&s;ures more abundant and
more genuine, than were enjoyed by any nation under
heaven. Even their &s;outhern neighbours, they thought,
though &s;eparated from Rome, &s;till retained a great tincture
of the primitive pollution; and their liturgy was repre&s;ented
as a &s;pecies of ma&s;s, though with &s;ome le&s;s &s;how and em|broidery<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">King's Decl. p. 20.</NOTE>.
Great prejudices, therefore, were entertained
again&s;t it, even con&s;idered in it&s;elf; much more, when re|garded
as a preparative, which was &s;oon to introduce into
Scotland all the abominations of popery. And as the very
few alterations, which di&s;tingui&s;hed the new liturgy from
the Engli&s;h, &s;eemed to approach nearer to the doctrine of
the real pre&s;ence; this circum&s;tance was deemed an un|doubted
confirmation of every &s;u&s;picion, with which the
people were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed<NOTE N="w" PLACE="foot">Burnet's Mem. p. 31. Ru&s;h. vol. ii. p. 396. May, p. 31.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>EASTER-DAY was, by proclamation, appointed for the
fir&s;t reading of the &s;ervice in Edinburgh: But in order to
judge more &s;urely of mens di&s;po&s;itions, the council delayed
the matter till the 23d of July; and they even gave no|tice,
the Sunday before, of their intention to commence the
u&s;e of the new liturgy. As no con&s;iderable &s;ymptoms of
di&s;content appeared, they thought that they might &s;afely
proceed in their purpo&s;e<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">King's Decl. p. 22. Clarendon ol. p. 108. Ru&s;hworth, vol. ii. p. 387.</NOTE>; and accordingly, in the cathe|dral
church of St. Giles, the dean of Edinburgh, arrayed
in his &s;urplice, began the &s;ervice; the bi&s;hop him&s;elf and
many of the privy council being pre&s;ent.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tumult at Edinburgh.</NOTE> But no &s;ooner
had the dean opened the book, than a multitude of the

cur&s;ing, and crying out, <HI>A pope! a pope! antichri&s;t! &s;tone
him!</HI> rai&s;ed &s;uch a tumult, that it was impo&s;&s;ible to pro|ceed
with the &s;ervice. The bi&s;hop, mounting the pulpit,
in order to appea&s;e the populace, had a &s;tool thrown at
him: The council were in&s;ulted: And it was with diffi|culty,
<PB N="264" REF="308">
that the magi&s;trates were able, partly by authority,
partly by force, to expel the rabble, and to &s;hut the doors
again&s;t them. The tumult, however, &s;till continued with|out:
Stones were thrown at the doors and windows: And
when the &s;ervice was ended, the bi&s;hop, going home, was
attacked, and narrowly e&s;caped from the hands of the en|raged
multitude. In the afternoon, the lord privy &s;eal, be|cau&s;e
he carried the bi&s;hop in his coach, was &s;o pelted with
&s;tones, and whooted at with execrations, and pre&s;&s;ed upon by
the eager populace, that, if his &s;ervants, with drawn &s;words,
had not kept them off, the bi&s;hop had run the utmo&s;t ha|zard
of his life<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">King's Decl. p. 23, 24, 25. Ru&s;h. vol. ii. p. 388.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THOUGH it was violently &s;u&s;pected, that the low rabble,
who alone appeared, had been in&s;tigated by &s;ome of higher
condition, yet no proof of it could ever be produced; and
every one &s;pake with di&s;approbation of the licentiou&s;ne&s;s of
the giddy multitude<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">King's Decl. p. 26, 30. Clarendon, vol. i. p. 109.</NOTE>. It was not thought &s;afe, however,
to hazard a new in&s;ult by any new attempt to read the litur|gy;
and the populace &s;eemed, for the time, to be appea&s;ed
and &s;atisfied. But it being known, that the King &s;till per|&s;evered
in his intentions of impo&s;ing that mode of wor&s;hip,
men fortified them&s;elves &s;till farther in their prejudices
again&s;t it; and great multitudes re&s;orted to Edinburgh,
in order to oppo&s;e the introduction of &s;o hated a novelty<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">King's Decl. p. 32. Ru&s;hworth, vol. ii. p. 400.</NOTE>.
It was not long before they broke out into the mo&s;t violent
di&s;order.<NOTE PLACE="marg">18th Oct.</NOTE> The bi&s;hop of Galloway was attacked in the
&s;treets, and cha&s;ed into the chamber, where the privy coun|cil
was &s;itting. The council it&s;elf was be&s;ieged and violently
attacked: The town-council met with the &s;ame fate: And
nothing could have &s;aved the lives of all of them, but their
application to &s;ome popular lords, who protected them, and
di&s;per&s;ed the multitude. In this &s;edition, the actors were
<PB N="265" REF="309">
of &s;ome better condition than in the former; though no|body
of rank &s;eemed, as yet, to countenance them<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">King's Decl. p. 35, 36, &amp;c. Ru&s;h, vol. ii. p. 404.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>ALL men, however, began to unite and to encourage
each other, in oppo&s;ition to the religious innovations in|troduced
into the kingdom. Petitions to the council were
&s;igned and pre&s;ented by per&s;ons of the highe&s;t quality: The
women took party, and, as is u&s;ual, with great violence:
The clergy, every where, loudly declaimed again&s;t popery
and the liturgy, which they repre&s;ented as the &s;ame: The
pulpits re&s;ounded with vehement invectives again&s;t anti|chri&s;t:
And the populace, who fir&s;t oppo&s;ed the &s;ervice,
was often compared to Balaam's a&s;s, an animal, in it&s;elf,
&s;tu|pid and &s;en&s;ele&s;s, but who&s;e mouth had been opened by the
Lord, to the admiration of the whole world<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">King's Decl. p. 31.</NOTE>. In &s;hort,
fanatici&s;m mingling with faction, private intere&s;t with the
&s;pirit of liberty, &s;ymptoms appeared, on all hands, of the
mo&s;t dangerous in&s;urrection and di&s;order.</P>
<P>THE primate, a man of wi&s;dom and religion, who was
all along aver&s;e to the introduction of the liturgy, repre|&s;ented
to the King the &s;tate of the nation: The Earl of
Traquaire, lord trea&s;urer, &s;et out for London, in order to
lay the matter more fully before him: Every circum&s;tance,
whether the condition of England or of Scotland was con|&s;idered,
&s;hould have engaged him to de&s;i&s;t from &s;o ha|zardous
an attempt: Yet was Charles inflexible. In his
whole conduct of this affair, there appeared no marks of
the good &s;en&s;e, with which he was undoubtedly endowed:
A lively in&s;tance of that &s;pecies of character, &s;o frequently
to be met with; where there are found parts and judgment
in every di&s;cour&s;e and opinion; in many actions, indi&s;cre|tion
and imprudence. Mens views of things are the re&s;ult
of their under&s;tanding alone: Their conduct is regulated
by their under&s;tanding, their temper, and their pa&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P><PB N="266" REF="310">
To &s;o violent a combination of an whole kingdom,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1638.</NOTE>
Charles had nothing to oppo&s;e but a proclamation;<NOTE PLACE="marg">19th of Feb.</NOTE> in which
he pardoned all pa&s;t offences, and exhorted the people to be
more obedient for the future, and to &s;ubmit peaceably to
the u&s;e of the liturgy. This proclamation was in&s;tantly en|countered
with a public prote&s;tation, pre&s;ented by the Earl
of Hume and Lord Linde&s;ey: And this was the fir&s;t time,
that men of quality had appeared in any violent act of op|po&s;ition<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">King's Decl. p. 47, 48, &amp;c. Guthry, p. 28. May, p. 37.</NOTE>.
But this proved a cri&s;is. The in&s;urrection,
which had been advancing by a gradual and &s;low progre&s;s,
now blazed out at once. No di&s;order, however, attended
it. On the contrary, a new order immediately took place.
Four <HI>tables,</HI> as they were called, were. formed in Edinburgh.
One con&s;i&s;ted of nobility, another of gentry, a third of mi|ni&s;ters,
a fourth of burge&s;&s;es. The table of gentry was
divided into many &s;ubordinate tables, according to their
different counties. In the hands of the four tables, the
whole authority of the kingdom was placed. Orders were
i&s;&s;ued by them, and every where obeyed, with the utmo&s;t
regularity<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Cla|reendon, vol. i. p. III. Ru&s;hworth, vol. ii. p. 734.</NOTE>. And among the fir&s;t acts of their government was the production of the COVENANT.</P>
<P>THIS famous covenant con&s;i&s;ted fir&s;t of a re$unciation
of popery,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Cove|$ant,</NOTE> formerly &s;igned by James in his youth, and
compo&s;ed of many invectives, fitted to inflame the minds
of men again&s;t their fellow creatures, whom heaven has en|joined
them to cheri&s;h and to love. There followed a bond
of union, by which the &s;ub&s;cribers obliged them&s;elves to
re&s;i&s;t religious innovations, and to defend eath other again&s;t
all oppo&s;ition whatever: And all this, for the greater glory
of God, and the greater honour and advantage of their
king and country<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">King's Decl. p. 57, 58. Ru&s;hworth, vol. ii. p. 734. May, p. 38.</NOTE>. All ranks and conditions, all ages and
&s;exes, flocked to the &s;ub&s;cription of this covenant: Few,
in their judgment, di&s;approved of it; and &s;till fewer dared
<PB N="267" REF="311">
openly to condemn it. The King's mini&s;ters and coun&s;ellors
them&s;elves were, mo&s;t of them, &s;eized by the general con|tagion.
And none but rebels to God, and traitors to their
country, it was thought, would withdraw them&s;elves from
&s;o &s;alutary and &s;o pious a combination.</P>
<P>THE treacherous, the cruel, the unrelenting Philip, ac|companied
with all the terrors of a Spani&s;h inqui&s;ition, was
&s;carcely, during the preceding century, oppo&s;ed in the Low
Countries with more determined fury, than was now, by
the Scots, the mild, the humane Charles, attended with
his inoffen&s;ive liturgy.</P>
<P>THE King began to apprehend the con&s;equences.<NOTE PLACE="marg">June</NOTE> He
&s;ent the Marquis of Hamilton, as commi&s;&s;ioner, with au|thority
to treat with the covenanters. He required the co|venant
to be renounced and recalled: And he thought, that
on his part he had made very &s;atisfactory conce&s;&s;ions, when
he offered to &s;u&s;pend the canons and the liturgy, till, in a
fair and legal way, they could be received; and &s;o to mo|del
the high commi&s;&s;ion, that it &s;hould no longer give of|fence
to his &s;ubjects<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Ru&s;h. vol. ii. p. 754, &amp;c.</NOTE>. Such general declarations could
not well give content to any, much le&s;s to tho&s;e who car|ried
&s;o much higher their preten&s;ions. The covenanters
found them&s;elves &s;econded by the zeal of the whole nation.
Above &s;ixty thou&s;and people were a&s;&s;embled in a tumultuous
manner about Edinburgh. Charles po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed no regular
forces in either of his kingdoms. And the di&s;contents in
England, tho' &s;ecret, were believed &s;o violent, that the King,
it was thought, would find it very difficult to employ in &s;uch
a cau&s;e the power of that nation. The more, therefore, the
popular leaders in Scotland con&s;idered their &s;ituation, the le&s;s
apprehen&s;ion did they entertain of royal power, and the more
rigorou&s;ly did they in&s;i&s;t on intire &s;atisfaction. In an&s;wer
to Hamilton's demand of renouncing the covenant, they
plainly told him, that they would &s;ooner renounce their
bapti&s;<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">King's Decl. p. 87.</NOTE>. And the mini&s;ters invited the commi&s;&s;ioner him&s;elf
<PB N="268" REF="312">
to &s;ub&s;cribe it; by informing him; &startq; With what peace
and comfort it had filled the hearts of all God's people;
what re&s;olutions and beginnings of reformation of man|ners
were &s;en&s;ibly perceived in all parts of the nation,
above any mea&s;ure they had ever before found or could
have expected; how great glory the Lord had received
thereby; and what confidence they had, that God would
make Scotland a ble&s;&s;ed kingdom<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">King's Decl. p. 88. Ru&s;hworth, vol. ii. p. 751.</NOTE>&endq;.</P>
<P>HAMILTON returned to London:<NOTE PLACE="marg">17th Sept.</NOTE> Made another fruit|le&s;s
journey, with new conce&s;&s;ions, to Edinburgh: Return|ed
again to London; and was immediatly &s;ent back with
&s;till more &s;atisfactory conce&s;&s;ions. The King was now
willing intirely to aboli&s;h the canons, the liturgy, and the
high commi&s;&s;ion court. He was even re&s;olved to limit ex|tremely
the power of the bi&s;hops, and was content, if, on
any terms, he could retain that order in the church of
Scotland<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">King's Decl. p. 137. Ru&s;h. vol. ii. p. 762.</NOTE>. And to en&s;ure all the&s;e gracious offers, he gave
Hamilton authority to &s;ummon fir&s;t an a&s;&s;embly, then a par|liament,
where every national grievance might be redre&s;&s;ed
and remedied. The&s;e &s;ucce&s;&s;ive conce&s;&s;ions of the King,
which yet came &s;till &s;hort of the ri&s;ing demands of the
malecontents, di&s;covered his own weakne&s;s, encouraged their
in&s;olence, and gave no &s;atisfaction. The offer, however,
of an a&s;&s;embly and a parliament, in which they expected to
be intirely ma&s;ters, was very willingly embraced by all the
covenanters.</P>
<P>CHARLES, perceiving what advantage his enemies had
reaped from their covenant, re&s;olved to have a covenant on
his &s;ide; and he ordered one to be drawn up for that
purpo&s;e. It con&s;i&s;ted of the &s;ame violent renunciation of
popery above-mentioned; which, though the King did not
approve of it, he thought it &s;afe&s;t to adopt, in order to re|move
all the &s;u&s;picions entertained again&s;t him. As the
<PB N="269" REF="313">
covenanters, in their bond of mutual defence again&s;t all op|po&s;ition,
had been careful not to accept the King; Charles
had formed a bond, which was annexed to this renunciation,
and which expre&s;&s;ed the &s;ub&s;cribers duty and loyalty to his
Maje&s;ty<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">King's Decl, p. 140, &amp;c.</NOTE>. But the covenanters, perceiving, that this new
covenant was only meant too weaken and divide them, re|ceived
it with the utmo&s;t &s;corn and dete&s;tation. And with|out
delay, they proceeded to the modelling the future a&s;|&s;embly,
from which &s;uch great atchievements were ex|pected<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Ru&s;h. vol. ii. p. 772.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE genius of that religion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A general a&s;&s;embly.</NOTE> which prevailed in Scot|land,
and which, every day, was &s;ecretly gaining ground in
England, was far from inculcating deference and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion
to the eccle&s;ia&s;tics, merely as &s;uch: Or rather, by nouri&s;h|ing
in every individual, the, highe&s;t raptures and ec&s;ta&s;ies of
devotion, it con&s;ecrated, in a manner, every individual, and
in his own eyes, be&s;towed a character on him, much &s;upe|rior
to what forms and ceremonious in&s;titutions could alone
confer. The clergy of Scotland, though &s;uch tumult was
excited about religious wor&s;hip and di&s;cipline, were both
poor, and in &s;mall numbers; nor are they, in general, to
be con&s;idered, at lea&s;t in the beginning, as the ringleaders
of the &s;edition, which was rai&s;ed on their account. On
the contrary, the laity, apprehending, from &s;everal in&s;tances,
which occurred, a &s;pirit of moderation in that order, re|&s;olved
to domineer intirely in the a&s;&s;embly, which was
&s;ummoned, and to hurry on the eccle&s;ia&s;tics by the &s;ame
furious zeal, with which they were them&s;elves tran&s;ported<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">King's Decl. p. 188, 189. Ru&s;hworth, vol. ii. p. 761.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IT had been u&s;ual, before the e&s;tabli&s;hment of prelacy,
for each pre&s;bytery to &s;end to the a&s;&s;embly, be&s;ides two or

and univer&s;ities &s;ent likewi&s;e commi&s;&s;ioners, the lay|members,
in that eccle&s;ia&s;tical court, very nearly equalled
the eccle&s;ia&s;tics. Not only this in&s;titution, which James,
apprehen&s;ive of zeal in the laity, had aboli&s;hed, was now
revived by the covenanters: They al&s;o introduced an inno|vation,
which &s;erved &s;till farther to reduce the clergy to
&s;ubjection. By an edict of the tables, who&s;e authority was
&s;upreme, an elder, from each pari&s;h was ordered to at|tend
the pre&s;bytery, and to give his vote in the choice both
of the commi&s;&s;ioners and mini&s;ters, who &s;hould be deputed
to the a&s;&s;embly. As it is not u&s;ual for the mini&s;ters, who
are put in the li&s;t of candidates, to claim a vote, the whole
elections, by that means, fell into the hands of the laity: The
mo&s;t furious of all ranks were cho&s;en: And the more to
over-awe the clergy, a new device was fallen upon, of
chu&s;ing, to every commi&s;&s;ioner, four or five lay-a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors,
who, though they could have no vote, yet might interpo&s;e
with their coun&s;el and authority in the a&s;&s;embly<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">King's Decl. p. 190, 191, 290. Guthry, p. 39, &amp;c.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE a&s;&s;embly met at Gla&s;gow: And, be&s;ides a great con|cour&s;e
of the people, all the nobility and gentry of any fa|mily
or intere&s;t were pre&s;ent, either as members, a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors,
or &s;pectators; and it was apparent, that the re&s;olutions,
taken by the covenanters, could here meet with no manner
of oppo&s;ition. A firm determination had been entered into,
of utterly aboli&s;hing epi&s;copacy; and as a preparative to
it, there was laid before the pre&s;bytery of Edinburgh, and
&s;olemnly read in all the churches of the kingdom, an accu|&s;ation
again&s;t the bi&s;hops, as guilty, all of them, of here&s;y,
&s;imony, bribery, perjury, cheating, ince&s;t, adultery, for|nication,

and little regarded. The court &s;till continued to &s;it,
and to fini&s;h their bu&s;ine&s;s<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">May, p. 44.</NOTE>. All the acts of a&s;&s;embly, &s;ince
the acce&s;&s;ion of James to the crown of England, were,
upon pretty rea&s;onable grounds, declared null and invalid.
The acts of parliament, which affected eccle&s;ia&s;tical affairs,
were &s;uppo&s;ed, on that very account, to have no manner of
authority.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Epi&s;copacy aboli&s;hed.</NOTE> And thus epi&s;copacy, the high commi&s;&s;ion, the

James and Charles, in a long cour&s;e of years, had been
rearing with &s;o much care and policy, fell at once to the
ground. The covenant likewi&s;e was ordered to be &s;igned
by every one, under pain of excommunication<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">King's Decl. p. 317.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE independency of the eccle&s;ia&s;tical upon the civil
power was the old pre&s;byterian principle,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1639.</NOTE> which had been
zealou&s;ly adopted at the reformation, and which, though
James and Charles had obliged the church publicly to di&s;|claim
it, had &s;ecretly been adhered to by all ranks of people.
It was commonly a&s;ked, whether Chri&s;t or the King were
&s;uperior? And as the an&s;wer &s;eemed obvious, it was in|ferred,
that the a&s;&s;embly, being Chri&s;t's council, was &s;u|perior,
in all &s;piritual matters, to the parliament, which
was only the King's. But as the covenanters were &s;en&s;ible,
that this con&s;equence, though it &s;eemed to them irrefraga|ble,
would not be a&s;&s;ented to by the King; it became re|qui&s;ite
to maintain their religious tenets by military force,
and not to tru&s;t intirely to &s;upernatural a&s;&s;i&s;tance, of which,
however, they held them&s;elves well a&s;&s;ured. They ca&s;t
their eyes on all &s;ides, abroad and at home, whence ever
they could expect any aid or &s;upport.</P>
<P>AFTER France and Holland had entered into a league
again&s;t Spain, and framed a treaty of partition, by which
<PB N="272" REF="316">
they were to conquer and to divide between them the Low|country-provinces,
England, was invited to pre&s;erve a neu|trality
between the contending parties, while the French
and Dutch &s;hould attack the maritime towns of Flanders.
But the King replied to d'E&s;trades, the French amba&s;&s;ador,
who opened the propo&s;al, that he had a &s;quadron ready,
and would cro&s;s the &s;eas, if nece&s;&s;ary, with an army of
15,000 men, in order to prevent the&s;e projected conque&s;ts<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Mem. d'E&s;trades, vol. i.</NOTE>.
This an&s;wer, which proves, that Charles, though he ex|pre&s;&s;ed
his mind with an imprudent candor, had, at la&s;t,
acquired a ju&s;t idea of national intere&s;t, irritated extremely
Cardinal Richlieu; and in revenge, that politic and enter|prizing
mini&s;ter carefully fomented the fir&s;t commotions
in Scotland, and &s;ecretly &s;upplied the covenanters with money
and arms, in order to encourage them in their oppo&s;ition
again&s;t their &s;overeign.</P>
<P>BUT the chief re&s;ource of the Scots malecontents, was
in them&s;elves, and in their own vigour and ability. No
regular e&s;tabli&s;hed commonwealth could take ju&s;ter mea&s;ures,
or execute them with greater promptitude, than did this
tumultuous combination, inflamed with bigotry for reli|gious
trifles; and faction without a rea&s;onable object. The
whole kingdom was, in a manner, engaged; and the men
of greate&s;t ability, &s;oon acquired the a&s;cendant, which
their family intere&s;ted enabled them to maintain. The Earl
of Argyle, though he long &s;eemed to temporize, had, at
last, embraced the covenant; and he became the chief leader
of that party: A man equally &s;upple and inflexible,
cautious and determined, and intirely qualified to make a
figure during a factious and turbulent period. The Earls
of Rothes, Ca&s;&s;ils, Montro&s;e, Lothian, the Lords Linde&s;ey,
Loudon, Ye&s;ter, Balmerino, di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves in
that party. Many Scots officers had acquired reputation in
the German wars,<NOTE PLACE="marg">War,</NOTE> particularly under Gu&s;tavus; and the&s;e
<PB N="273" REF="317">
were invited over to a&s;&s;i&s;t their country in her pre&s;ent ne|ce&s;&s;ity.
The command was entru&s;ted to Le&s;ly, a &s;oldier of
experience and ability. Forces were regularly inli&s;ted and
di&s;ciplined. Arms were commi&s;&s;ioned and imported from
foreign countries. A few ca&s;tles, which belonged to the
King, being unprovided of victuals, ammunition, and gar|ri&s;ons,
were &s;oon &s;eized. And the whole country, except
a &s;mall part; where the Marquis of Huntley &s;till adhered to
the King, being in the covenanters hands, was, in a very
little time, put into a tolerable po&s;ture of defence<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">May, p. 49.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE fortifications of Leith were begun and carried on
with great rapidity. Be&s;ides the inferior &s;ort, and tho&s;e
who laboured for pay, incredible numbers of volunteers,
even noblemen and gentlemen, put their hand to the work,
and deemed the mo&s;t abject employment to be dignified by
the &s;anctity of the cau&s;e. Women too, of rank and con|dition,
forgetting the delicacy of their &s;ex, and the decorum
of their character, were intermingled with the lowe&s;t rabble;
and carried, on their &s;houlders, the rubbi&s;h, requi&s;ite for
compleating the fortifications<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Guthry's Memoirs, p. 46.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>WE mu&s;t not omit another auxiliary of the covenanters,
and no incon&s;iderable one; a prophete&s;s, who was much
followed and admired by all ranks of people. Her name
was Michel&s;on, a woman full of whim&s;ies, parly hy&s;terical,
partly religious; and inflamed with a zealous concern for
the eccle&s;ia&s;tical di&s;cipline of the pre&s;byterians. She &s;poke
only at certain times, and had often interruptions of days and
weeks: But when &s;he began to renew her ec&s;ta&s;ies, warn|ing
of the happy event was conveyed over the whole country,
thou&s;ands crowded about her hou&s;e, and every word, which
&s;he uttered, was received with veneration, as the mo&s;t &s;a|cred
oracles. The covenant was her perpetual theme. The
true, genuine covenant, &s;he &s;aid, was ratified in heaven:
The King's covenant was an invention of Satan: When
<PB N="274" REF="318">
&s;he &s;poke of Chri&s;t, &s;he commonly called him by the name
of the covenanting Je&s;us. Rollo, a popular preacher, and
zealous covenanter, was her great favourite; and payed her,
on his part, no le&s;s veneration. Being de&s;ired by the &s;pec|tators
to pray with her, and &s;peak to her; he an&s;wered,
&startq;That he dur&s;t not, and that it would be ill manners in
him to &s;peak, while his ma&s;ter Chri&s;t was &s;peaking in
her<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">King's Declaration at large, p. 227. Burnet's Memoirs of Hamilton.</NOTE>.&endq;</P>
<P>CHARLES had agreed to reduce epi&s;copal authority &s;o
much, that it would no longer have been of any &s;ervice to
&s;upport the crown; and this &s;acrifice of his own intere&s;t he
was willing to make, in order to obtain public peace and
tranquility. But he could not con&s;ent entirely to aboli&s;h an
order, which he e&s;teemed as e&s;&s;ential to the being of a
chri&s;tian church, as his Scots &s;ubjects thought it incom|patible
with that &s;acred in&s;titution. This narrowne&s;s of
mind, if we would be impartial, we mu&s;t either blame or
excu&s;e equally on both &s;ides; and thereby anticipate, by a
little reflection, that judgment, which time, by introducing
new &s;ubjects of controver&s;y, will undoubtedly $render quite
familiar to po&s;terity.</P>
<P>So great was Charles's aver&s;ion to violent and &s;anguinary
mea&s;ures, and &s;o &s;trong his affection to his native kingdom,
that, it is probable, the conte&s;t in his brea&s;t would be
nearly equal between the&s;e laudable pa&s;&s;ions, and his attach|ment
to the hierarchy. The latter affection, however, pre|vailed
for, the time, and made him ha&s;ten tho&s;e military
preparations, which he had projected for &s;ubduing the re|fractory
&s;pirit of the Scots nation. By regular oeconomy,
he had not only payed all the debts contracted during the
Spani&s;h and French wars; but had ama&s;&s;ed a &s;um of two
hundred thou&s;and pounds, which he had re&s;erved for any
&s;udden exigency. The Queen had great intere&s;t with the
catholics, both from the &s;ympathy of religion, and from the
<PB N="275" REF="319">
favours and indulgences, which &s;he had been able to pro|cure
them. She now employed her credit, and per&s;uaded
them, that it was rea&s;onable to give large contributions, as
a mark of their duty to the King, during this urgent ne|ce&s;&s;ity<NOTE N="w" PLACE="foot">Ru&s;h. vol. iii. p. 1329. Franklyn, p. 767.</NOTE>.
A con&s;iderably &s;upply was gained by this means;
to the great &s;candal of the puritants, who were mightily of|fended
at &s;eeing the King on &s;uch good terms with the pa|pi&s;ts,
and repined, that others &s;hould give what they them|&s;elves
were di&s;po&s;ed to refu&s;e him.</P>
<P>CHARLES'S fleet was formidable and well &s;upplied.
Having, put 5000 land forces on board, he entru&s;ted it to
the Marquis of Hamilton, who had orders to &s;ail to the
frith, of Forth, and to cau&s;e a diver&s;ion in the forces of the
malecontents. An army was levied of near 20,000 foot,
and above 3000 hor&s;e, and was put under the command of
the Earl of Arundel, a Nobleman of great family, but ce|lebrated
neither for military nor political abilities. The
Earl of E&s;&s;ex, a man of &s;trict honour, and extremely popular,
e&s;pecially among the &s;oldiery, was apponted lieutenant-general:
The Earl of Holland was general of the hor&s;e. The King
him&s;elf joined the army,<NOTE PLACE="marg">29th May.</NOTE> and he &s;ummoned all, the peers of
England to attend him. The whole had the appearance of
a &s;plendid court, rather than of a military armament; and
in this &s;ituation, carrying More &s;how than real force with
it, the camp arrived at Berwick<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Clarendon, vol. i. p. 115, 116, 117.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE Scots army was as numerous as that of the King,
but inferior in cavalry. The officers had more reputation
and experience; and the &s;oldiers, though undi&s;ciplined and
ill armed, were animated, as Well by the national aver&s;ion
to England and the dread of becoming a province to their
old enemy, as by an un&s;urmountable &s;ervour of religion.
The pulpits had extremely a&s;&s;i&s;ted the officers in levying re|cruits,
and had thundered out anathemas upon all tho&s;e
<HI>who went not out to a&s;&s;i&s;t the Lord again&s;t the mighty</HI><NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Burnet's Memoirs of Hamilton.</NOTE>.

Yet &s;o prudent were the leaders of the malecontents, that
they immediately &s;ent very &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive me&s;&s;ages to the King,
and craved leave to be admitted to a treaty.</P>
<P>CHARLES knew, that the force of the covenanters was
con&s;iderable, their &s;pirits high, their zeal furious; and as
they were not yet daunted by any ill &s;ucce&s;s, no rea&s;onable
terms could be expected from them. With regard there|fore
to a treaty, great difficulties occurred on both &s;ides.
Should he &s;ubmit to the preten&s;ions of the malecontents;
be&s;ides that the prelacy mu&s;t be &s;acrificed to their religious
prejudices; &s;uch a check would be given to regal authority,
which had, very lately, and with much difficulty, been
thoroughly e&s;tabli&s;hed in Scotland, that he mu&s;t expect
for ever after, to retain, in that kingdom, no more than the
appearance of maje&s;ty. The great men, having proved,
by &s;o &s;en&s;ible a trial, the impotence of law and prerogative,
would return to their former licentious&s;ne&s;s: The preachers
would retain their innate arrogance: And the people, un|protected
by ju&s;tice, would recognize no other authority,
than that which they found to domineer over them. Eng|land
al&s;o, it was much to be feared, would imitate &s;o bad
an example; and having already a &s;trong propen&s;ity to|wards
republican and puritanical factions, would expect, by
the &s;ame &s;editious practices, to attain the &s;ame indulgence.
To advance &s;o far, without bringing the rebels to a total
&s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, at lea&s;t to rea&s;onable conce&s;&s;ions, was to pro|mi&s;e
them, in all future time, an impunity for rebellion.</P>
<P>ON the other hand, Charles con&s;idered, that Scotland
was never before, under any of his ance&s;tors, &s;o united,
and &s;o animated in its own defence; and yet had often been
able to foil or elude the force of England, combined heartily
in one cau&s;e, and enured by long practice to the u&s;e of
arms. How much greater difficulty &s;hould he find, at pre|&s;ent,
to &s;ubdue, by violence, a people, enflamed with reli|gious
prejudices; while he could only oppo&s;e to, them a
nation, enervated by long peace, and lukewarm in his &s;er|vice
<PB N="277" REF="323">
or what was more to be feared, many of them en|gaged
in the &s;ame party with the enemy<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Ru&s;h, vol. iii. p. 936.</NOTE>. Should the war
be only protracted beyond a &s;ummer; (and who could ex|pect
to fini&s;h it in that period?) his trea&s;ure would fail him;
and, for &s;upply, he mu&s;t have recour&s;e to an Engli&s;h par|liament,
whom, by fatal experience, he had ever found
more ready to encroach on the prerogatives, than to aid the
nece&s;&s;ities, of the crown. And what if he $eceive a defeat
from the rebel army? This misfortune was far from im|po&s;&s;ible.
They were engaged in a national cau&s;e, and
&s;trongly actuated by mi&s;taken principles. His army was
retained entirely by pay, and looked on the quarrel with the
&s;ame indifference, which naturally belongs to mercenary
troops, without po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the di&s;cipline, by which &s;uch
troops are commonly di&s;tingui&s;hed. And the con&s;equences
of a defeat, while Scotland was enraged and England di&s;|contented,
were &s;o dreadful, that no motive &s;hould per&s;uade him to venture it.</P>
<P>IT is evident, that Charles, by mi&s;takes and over&s;ights,
had brought him&s;elf to &s;uch a &s;ituation, that, whatever
&s;ide he embraced, his errors mu&s;t be dangerous: No won|der,
therefore, he was in great perplexity. But he did in|finitely
wor&s;e, than embrace the wor&s;t party: For, pro|perly
&s;peaking, he embraced no party at all. He concluded
a &s;udden pacification, in which it was &s;tipulated, That he
&s;hould withdraw his fleet and army; that, within eight and
forty hours, the Scots &s;hould di&s;mi&s;s their, forces, that the
King's forts &s;hould be re&s;tored to him; his authority ac|knowleged;
and a general a&s;&s;embly and a parliament be im|mediately
&s;ummoned, in order to compo&s;e all differences<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Idem ibid. p. 945.</NOTE>. What were the <HI>rea&s;ons,</HI> which engaged the King to admit
&s;uch &s;trange articles of peace, it is in vain to enquire: For
there could be none. The <HI>cau&s;es</HI> of that event may admit
of a more ea&s;y explication.

THE $word$ had been very indn&s;trious, in repre|&s;enting
to the Engli&s;h, the grievances under which Scotland
laboured, and the ill coun&s;els, which had been &s;ugge&s;ted to
their, &s;overeign. Their liberties, they &s;aid, were invaded:
The prerogatives of the crown extended beyond all former
precedent: Illegal courts erected: The hierarchy exalted
at the expence of national privileges: And &s;o many new
&s;uper&s;titions introduced by the haughty tyrannical prelates,
as begot a ju&s;t &s;u&s;picion, that a project was &s;eriou&s;ly formed
for the re&s;toration of popery. The King's conduct, &s;urely,
in Scotland, had been, in every thing, except in e&s;tabli&s;h|ing
the eccle&s;ia&s;tical canons, more legal and ju&s;tifiable, than
in England; yet was the$e &s;uch a general re&s;emblance in
the complaints of both kingdoms, that the Engli&s;h readily
a&s;&s;ented to all the repre&s;entations of the Scots malecontents,
and believed that nation to have been driven, by oppre&s;&s;ion,
into the violent coun&s;els, which they had embraced. So
far, therefore, from being willing to &s;econd the King in
&s;ubduing the free &s;pirits of the Scots; they rather pitied
that unhappy people, who had been reduced to tho&s;e ex|tremities:
And they thought, that the example of &s;uch
neighbours, as well as their a&s;&s;i&s;tance, might, &s;oms time,
be advantageous to England, and encourage her to recover,
by a vigorous effort, her violated laws and liberties. The
gentry and nobility, who, without attachment to the
court, without command in the army, attended in great
numbers the Engli&s;h camp, greedily &s;eized, and propagated,
and gave authority to the&s;e &s;entiments: A retreat, very
little honourable, which the Earl of Holland, with a con|&s;iderable
detachment of the Engli&s;h forces, had made before
a detachment of the Scots, cau&s;ed all the&s;e humours to
blaze up at once: And the King, who&s;e character was not
&s;ufficiently vigorous nor deci&s;ive, and who was apr, from
facility, to embrace ha&s;ty coun&s;els, &s;uddnaly a&s;&s;ented to a
mea&s;ure, which was recommended by all about him, and
<PB N="279" REF="327">
which favoured his natural propen&s;ion towards the mi&s;guided
&s;ubjects of his native kingdom<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Clarendon, vol. i. p. 122, 123. May, p. 46.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>CHARLES, having &s;o far advanced in pacific mea&s;ures,
ought, with a &s;teddy re&s;olution, to have pro&s;ecuted them,
and have &s;ubmitted to every tolerable condition, demanded
by the a&s;&s;embly and parliament; nor &s;hould he have recom|menced
ho&s;tilities, but on account of &s;uch enormous and
unexpected preten&s;ions, as would have ju&s;tified his cau&s;e,
if po&s;&s;ible, to the whole Engli&s;h nation. So far, indeed,
he adopted this plan, that he agreed, not only to confirm
his former conce&s;&s;ions, of abrogating the canons, the li|turgy,
the high commi&s;&s;ion, and the articles of Perth; but
al&s;o to aboli&s;h the order it&s;elf of bi&s;hops, for which he had
&s;o zealou&s;ly contended<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Ru&s;h, vol. iii. p. 946.</NOTE>. But this conce&s;&s;ion was gained
by the utmo&s;t violence, which he could impo&s;e on his di&s;|po&s;ition
and prejudices: He even &s;ecretly retained an in|tention
of &s;eizing favourable opportunities, in order to reco|ver
the ground, which he had lo&s;t<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Burnet's Memoirs, p. 154. Ru&s;h. vol. iii. p. 951.</NOTE>. And one &s;tep farther
he could not prevail with him&s;elf to advance. The a&s;&s;em|bly,
when it met, payed not due deference to the king's
prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Aug. 17th</NOTE> but gave full indulgence to their own. They
voted epi&s;copacy to be unlawful in the church of Scotland:
He was willing to allow it contrary to the con&s;titutions of
that church. They &s;tigmati&s;ed the liturgy and canons, as
popi&s;h: He agreed &s;imply to aboli&s;h them. They deno|minated
the high commi&s;&s;ion, tyranny: He was content
to &s;et it a&s;ide<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Idem ibid. 958. &amp;c.</NOTE>. The parliament, which &s;at after the
a&s;&s;embly, advanced preten&s;ions, which tended to dimi|ni&s;h
the civil power of the monarch; and what pro|bably
affected Charles much more, they were proceeding
to ratify the acts of a&s;&s;embly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">War re|newed.</NOTE> when,<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Idem ibid. p. 955.</NOTE> by the King's in|&s;tructions,
Traquaire, the commi&s;&s;ioner, prorogued them.
And on account of the&s;e claims, which might ea&s;ily have
been fore&s;een, was the war renewed; with great advantages
<PB N="280" REF="328">
on the &s;ide of the covenanters,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1638.</NOTE> and di&s;advantages on that
of the King.</P>
<P>No &s;ooner had Charles concluded the pacification with|out
conditions, than the nece&s;&s;ity of his affairs, and his
want of money, obliged him to di&s;band his army; and, as
they had been held together &s;olely by mercenary views, it
was not po&s;&s;ible without great trouble, and expence, and
lo&s;s of time, again to a&s;&s;emble them. The more prudent
covenanters had concluded, that their preten&s;ions being
&s;o contrary to the intere&s;t, and &s;till more to the inclinations,
of the King, it was likely, that they &s;hould again be obliged
to &s;upport their cau&s;e by arms; and they were therefore
careful, in di&s;mi&s;&s;ing their troops, to pre&s;erve nothing but
the appearance of a pacific di&s;po&s;ition. The officers had
orders to be ready on the fir&s;t &s;ummons: The &s;oldiers
were warned not to think the nation &s;ecure from an Engli&s;h
inva&s;ion: And the religious zeal, which animated all ranks
of men, made them immediately $word$ to their &s;tandards, &s;o
&s;oon as the trumpet was &s;ounded by their &s;piritual and tem|poral
leaders. The credit, which, in their la&s;t exp$dition,
they had acquired, by obliging their &s;overeign to depart
from all his preten&s;ions, gave courage to every one, in un|dertaking
this new enterprize<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Clarendon, vol. i. p. 125. Ru&s;h. vol. iii. p. 1023.</NOTE></P>

<P>THE Earl of Traquaire had intercepted a letter, wrote
to the King of France by the Scots malecontents; and had
<PB N="281" REF="329">
conveyed this letter to the King. Charles, partly repenting
of the large conce&s;&s;ions which he had made to the Scots,
partly di&s;gu&s;ted at their fre&s;h in&s;olences and preten&s;ions,
&s;eized this opportunity of breaking with them. He had
thrown into the Tower, the Lord Loudon, commi&s;&s;ioner
from the covenanters; one of the per&s;ons who had &s;igned
the trea&s;onable letter<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Carendon, vol. i. p. 129. Ru&s;h. vol. iii. p. 956. May, p. 56.</NOTE> And he now laid the matter before
the parliament, whom he hoped to inflame by the re&s;ent|ment,
and alarm by the danger, of this application to a
foreign power. By the mouth of the lord keeper, Finch, he
di&s;covered his wants, and informed them, that he had been
able to a&s;&s;emble his army, and to &s;ub&s;i&s;t them, not by any
revenue which he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, but by means of a large debt
of above 300,000 pounds, which he had contracted, and
for which he had given &s;ecurity upon the crown-lands. He
repre&s;ented, That it was nece&s;&s;ary to grant &s;upplies for the
immediate and urgent demands of his military armaments:
That the &s;ea&s;on was far advanced, the time precious, and
none of it mu&s;t be lo&s;t in deliberation: That though
his coffers were empty, they had not been exhau&s;ted by un|nece&s;&s;ary
pomp, or &s;umptuous buildings, or any other kind
of magnificence: That whatever &s;upplies had been levied
from his &s;ubjects, had been employed for their advantage
and pre&s;ervation, and like vapours ri&s;ing out of the earth,
and gathered into a cloud, had fallen in &s;weet and refre&s;hing
&s;howers on the &s;ame fields from which they had, at fir&s;t,
been exhaled: That though he de&s;ired &s;uch immediate a&s;|&s;i&s;tance
as might prevent, for the time, a total di&s;order in
the government, he was far from any intention of pre|cluding
them of their right to inquire into the &s;tate of the
kingdom, and to offer him petitions for the redre&s;s of their

be afterwards allowed them for that purpo&s;e: That as he
expected only &s;uch &s;upply at pre&s;ent as the current &s;ervice

twice put &s;uch tru&s;t in his good intentions as to grant him,
in the beginning of the &s;e&s;&s;ion, a very large &s;upply, and had
ever experienced good effects from the confidence repo&s;ed in
him: And that, in every circum&s;tance, his people &s;hould
find his conduct &s;uitable to a ju&s;t, pious, and gracious

<P>HOWEVER plau&s;ible the&s;e topics, they made &s;mall im|pre&s;&s;ion
on the hou&s;e of commons. By &s;ome illegal, and
&s;everal &s;u&s;picious and imprudent mea&s;ures of the crown,
and by the courageous oppo&s;ition, which particular per&s;ons
amid&s;t dangers and hard&s;hips, had made to them; the
minds of men, throughout the nation, had taken &s;uch a
turn as to a&s;cribe every honour to the refractory oppo|&s;ers
of the King and the mini&s;ters. The&s;e were the
only patriots, the only lovers of their country, the only
heroes, and, perhaps too, the only true chri&s;tians. A
rea&s;onable compliance with the court, was &s;lavi&s;h
de|pendance; a regard to the King, &s;ervile flattery; a confi|dence
in his promi&s;es, &s;hameful pro&s;titution. This general
ca&s;t of thought, which has, more or le&s;s, prevailed in
England, during near a century and a half, and which has
been the cau&s;e of much good and much ill in public affairs,
never predominated more than during the reign of Charles.
The pre&s;ent hou&s;e of commons, being compo&s;ed intirely of
country gentlemen, who came into parliament with all their
native prejudices about them, could not fail to contain a
majority of the&s;e &s;tubborn patriots.</P>
<P>AFFAIRS likewife, by means of the Scots in&s;urrection,
and the general di&s;contents in England, were drawing &s;o
near a cri&s;is, that the leaders of the hou&s;e, &s;agacious and
<PB N="283" REF="331">
penetrating, began to fore&s;ee the con&s;equences, and to hope,
that the time, &s;o longed wi&s;hed for, was now come, when
royal authority mu&s;t fall into a total &s;ubordination on popu|lar
a&s;&s;emblies, and when public liberty mu&s;t acquire a full
a&s;cendant. By reducing the crown to nece&s;&s;ities, they had
hitherto found, that the King had been pu&s;hed into violent
coun&s;els, which had &s;erved extremely the purpo&s;es of his
adver&s;aries: And by multiplying the&s;e nece&s;&s;ities, it was
fore&s;een, that his prerogative, undermined on all &s;ides,
mu&s;t, at la&s;t, be overthrown, and be no longer dangerous
to the privileges of the people. Whatever, therefore, tended
to compo&s;e the differences between King and parliament,
and to pre&s;erve the government uniformly in its pre&s;ent
channel, was zealou&s;ly oppo&s;ed by the&s;e popular leaders;
and their pa&s;t conduct and &s;ufferings gave them credit &s;uffi|cient
to effect all their purpo&s;es.</P>
<P>TIS the &s;ituation which decides chiefly of the fortunes
and characters of men. The King, it mu&s;t be owned,
though prai&s;eworthy in many re&s;pects, was not endowed
with that ma&s;terly genius, which might enable him to ob|&s;erve,
in their infancy, the changes that aro&s;e in national
manners, and know how to accommodate his conduct to
them. He had not perceived, that his be&s;t policy was not,
by oppo&s;ition, much le&s;s by inva&s;ions and encroachments,
to enrage the republican &s;pirit of the people; but that he
ought, by gently departing from &s;ome branches of his he|reditary
authority, to endeavour, as far as po&s;&s;ible, to pre|&s;erve
the re&s;t from the inroads of his jealous &s;ubjects. Still
tenacious of his prerogative, he found, that he could not
pre&s;erve the old claims of the crown without a&s;&s;uming new
ones: A principle &s;imilar to that which many of his &s;ub|jects
&s;eem to have formed with regard to the liberties of the people.</P>
<P>THE hou&s;e of commons, therefore, moved by the&s;e and
many other obvious rea&s;ons, in&s;tead of taking notice of the
<PB N="284" REF="332">
King's complaints again&s;t his Scots &s;ubjects, or his applica|tions
for &s;upply, entered immediately upon grievances; and
a &s;peech, which Pym made them on that &s;ubject, was much
more hearkened to, than that which the lord keeper had de|livered
them in the name of their &s;overeign. The &s;ubject
of Pym's harangue has been &s;ufficiently explained above;
where we gave an account of all the grievances, imaginary
in the church, more real in the &s;tate, of which the nation,
at that time, &s;o loudly complained<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Clarendon, vol. i. p. 133. Ru&s;h. vol. iii. p. 1131. May. p. 60.</NOTE>. The hou&s;e began
with examining the behaviour of the &s;peaker the la&s;t day of
the former parliament; when he refu&s;ed, on account of the
King's command, to put the que&s;tion: And they declared it
a breach of privilege. They proceeded next to inquire in|to
the impri&s;onment and pro&s;ecution of Sir John Elliot,
Hollis, and Valentine<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Ru&s;h. vol. iii. p. 1136.</NOTE>: The affair of &s;hip-money was can|va&s;&s;ed:
And plentiful &s;ubject of inquiry was &s;ugge&s;ted on
all hands. Grievances were regularly cla&s;&s;ed under three
heads; tho&s;e with regard to the privileges of parliament,
the property of the &s;ubject, and religion<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Idem $d, p. 1147.</NOTE>. The King,
&s;eeing a large and inexhau&s;tible field opened, pre&s;&s;ed them
again for &s;upply; and finding his me&s;&s;age ineffectual, he
came to the hou&s;e of peers, and de&s;ired their good offices
with the commons. The peers were very &s;en&s;ible of the
King's urgent nece&s;&s;ities; and thought, that &s;upplies, on
this occa&s;ion, ought, both in rea&s;on and in decency, to go
before grievances. They ventured to repre&s;ent their &s;en&s;e
of the matter to the commons; but their interce&s;&s;ion did
harm. The commons had always claimed, as their pecu|liar
province, the granting &s;upplies; and, though the peers
had gone no farther than offering advice, they immediately
thought proper to vote &s;o unu&s;ual and unprecedented an in|terp$&s;ition
to be a breach of privilege<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">$word$, vol. i. p. 134.</NOTE>. Charles, in order
<PB N="285" REF="333">
to bring the matter of &s;upply to &s;ome i&s;&s;ue, &s;olicited the
hou&s;e with the new me&s;&s;ages: And finding, that the bu&s;ine&s;s
of &s;hip-money gave great alarm and di&s;gu&s;t; be&s;ides in|forming
them, that he never intended to make a con&s;tant re|venue
of it, that all the money levied had been regularly, with
other great &s;ums, expended on equipping the navy; he
now went &s;o far as to offer them intirely to aboli&s;h that im|po&s;ition,
by any law, which the commons &s;hould think
proper to pre&s;ent to him. In return, he a&s;ked only for his
urgent nece&s;&s;ities, a &s;upply of twelve &s;ub&s;idies, about &s;ix
hundred thou&s;and pounds, and that payable in three years;
but, at the &s;ame time, he let them know, that con&s;idering
the &s;ituation of his affairs, a delay, would be equivalent to a
denial<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Clarendon, vol. i. p. 135. Ru&s;h. vol. iii. p. 1154.</NOTE>. The King, though the majority was again&s;t him,
never had more friends in any hou&s;e of commons; and the
debate was carried on for two days, with great zeal and
warmth on both &s;ides.</P>
<P>IT was urged by the partizans of the court, That the
happie&s;t occa&s;ion, which the fonde&s;t wi&s;hes could &s;ugge&s;t,
was now pre&s;ented, of compo&s;ing all di&s;gu&s;ts and jealou&s;ies
between King and people, and of reconciling their &s;ove|reign,
for ever, to the u&s;e of parliaments. That if they,
on their part, laid a&s;ide all enormous claims and preten&s;ions,
and provided, in a rea&s;onable manner, for the public ne|ce&s;&s;ities;
they needed entertain no &s;u&s;picion of any in&s;atiable
ambition or illegal u&s;urpation in the crown. That though
due regard had not always been paid, during this reign, to
the rights of the people, yet no inva&s;ion of them had been
altogether deliberate and voluntary; much le&s;s, the re&s;ult of
wanton tyranny and inju&s;tice; and &s;till le&s;s, of a formed
de&s;ign to &s;ubvert the con&s;titution. That to repo&s;e a rea&s;on|able
confidence in the King, and generou&s;ly &s;upply his pre|&s;ent
wants, which proceeded neither from prodigality nor
mi&s;conduct, would be the true way to gain on his generous
nature, and to extort, by a gentle violence, &s;uch conce&s;&s;ions
<PB N="286" REF="334">
as were requi&s;ite for. the e&s;tabli&s;hment of public liberty.
That he had promi&s;ed, not only on the word of a. prince,
but al&s;o on that of a gentleman (the expre&s;&s;ion which he
had been plea&s;ed to u&s;e) that, after the &s;upply was granted,
the parliament &s;hould &s;till have the liberty to continue their
deliberations: Could it be &s;u&s;pected, that any man, any
prince, much le&s;s &s;uch a one, who&s;e word was, as yet, &s;a|cred
and inviolate, would, for &s;o &s;mall a motive, forfeit his
honour, and, with it, all future tru&s;t and confidence, by
breaking a promi&s;e, &s;o public and &s;o &s;olemn? That even if
the parliament &s;hould be deceived in repo&s;ing this confidence
in him, they neither lo&s;t any thing, nor incurred any danger;
&s;ince it was evidently nece&s;&s;ary, for the &s;ecurity of public
peace, to &s;upply him with money, in order to &s;uppre&s;s the
Scots rebellion. That he had &s;o far &s;uited his fir&s;t demands
to their prejudices, that he only a&s;ked a &s;upply for a few
months, and was willing, after &s;o &s;hort a tru&s;t, to fall again
into dependance, and to tru&s;t them for his farther &s;upport
and &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. That if he now &s;eemed to de&s;ire &s;ome|thing
farther, he al&s;o made them, in return, a con&s;iderable
offer, and was willing, for the furture, to depend on them for
a revenue, which was quite requi&s;ite for public honour and
&s;ecurity. That the nature of the Engli&s;h con&s;titution &s;up|po&s;ed
a mutual confidence between King and parliament:
And if they &s;hould refu&s;e it on their part, e&s;pecially with
circum&s;tances of &s;uch outrage and indignity; what could
be expected but a total di&s;&s;olution of government, and
violent factions, followed by the mo&s;t dangerous convul&s;ions
and inte&s;tine di&s;orders?</P>
<P>IN oppo&s;ition to the&s;e arguments, it was urged by the
malecontent party, That the court had di&s;covered, on their
&s;ide, but few &s;ymptoms of that mutual tru&s;t and confidence,
to which they now &s;o kindly invited the commons. That
eleven years intermi&s;&s;ion of parliaments, the longe&s;t which
was to be found in the Engli&s;h annals, was a &s;ufficient indi|cation
of the jealou&s;y entertained again&s;t the people; or
<PB N="287" REF="335">
rather of de&s;igns formed for the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of all their li|berties
and privileges. That the mini&s;ters might well plead
nece&s;&s;ity; not could any thing, indeed, be a &s;tronger proof
of &s;ome invincible nece&s;&s;ity, than their embracing a mea&s;ure,
for which they had conceived &s;o violent an aver&s;ion, as the
a&s;&s;embling of an Engli&s;h parliament. That this nece&s;&s;ity,
however, was purely mini&s;terial, not national. And if the
&s;ame grievances, eccle&s;ia&s;tial and civil, under which this
nation it&s;elf laboured, had pu&s;hed the Scots to extremities;
was it requi&s;ite, that the Engli&s;h &s;hould forge their own
chains, by impo&s;ing chains on their unhappy neighbours?
That the antient practice of parliaments was to give
grievances the precedency of &s;upply; and that this order,
&s;o carefully ob&s;erved by their ance&s;tors, was founded on a
jealou&s;y inherent in the con&s;titution, and was never inter|preted
as any particular diffidence of the pre&s;ent &s;overeign.
That a practice, which had been upheld, during times the
mo&s;t favourable to liberty, could not, in common prudence,
be departed from, where &s;uch undeniable rea&s;ons for &s;u&s;picion
had been afforded. That it was ridiculous to plead
the advanced &s;ea&s;on, and the urgent occa&s;ion for &s;upply;
when it plainly appeared, that, in order to afford a pretence
for this topics, and to &s;educe the commons, great political
contrivance had been employed. That the writs for elec|tions
were i&s;&s;ued early in the winter; and if the meeting of
the parliament had not purpo&s;ely been delayed, till &s;o near
the commencement of military operations, there had been
lei&s;ure &s;ufficient to have redre&s;&s;ed all national grievances, and
to have proceeded afterwards to an examination of the
King's occa&s;ion for &s;upply<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">The rea&s;on probably why the King &s;ummoned the parliament &s;o late, was, that he was re&s;olved to try, whether this hou&s;e of commons would be more compliant than their predece&s;&s;ors, and grant him &s;upply on any rea&s;onable terms. The urgency of the occa&s;ion, and the little time allowed for debate were motives and rea&s;ons, which he re&s;erved again&s;t the male-contents in the hou&s;e. He would not tru&s;t them with a long &s;e&s;&s;ion, till he had &s;een &s;ome better proofs of their compliance: A &s;entiment natural enough in his &s;ituation.</NOTE> That the intention of &s;o
<PB N="288" REF="336">
gro&s;s an artifice was to engage the commons, under pretence, of nece&s;&s;ity, to violate the regular order of parliament;
and a precedent of that kind being once e&s;tabli&s;hed, no inquiry
into public mea&s;ures would afterwards be permitted.
That &s;carce any argument, more unfavourable, could be
pleaded for &s;upply. than an offer to aboli&s;h &s;hip-money; a
taxation, the mo&s;t illegal and the most dangerous, which
had ever, in any reign, been impo&s;ed upon the nation. And
that, by bargaining for the remi&s;&s;ion of that duty, the
commons would,: in a manner, ratify, the authority, by
which it had been levied; or, at lea&s;t, give encouragement
for advancing new preten&s;ions of a like nature, in hopes of
re&s;igning them on like advantageous conditions.</P>
<P>THESE rea&s;oas, joined to &s;o many, occa&s;ions of ill humour,
&s;eemed to &s;way with the greater number: But to
make the matter wor&s;e, Sir Harry Vane, the &s;ecretary, told
the commons, without any authority from the King, that
nothing le&s;s than twelve &s;ub&s;idies would be accepted as a
recompence for the abolition of &s;hip-money. This a&s;&s;ertion,
proceeding from the indi&s;cretion, if we are not rather
to call it the treachery, of Vane, di&s;plea&s;ed the hou&s;e,
by &s;howing a &s;ti&s;&s;ne&s;s and rigidity in the King, which, in
a claim &s;o ill grounded, was deemed inexcu&s;able<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Clarendon, vol. i. p. 138</NOTE> We are
informed likewi&s;e, that &s;ome men, who were thought to
under&s;tand the &s;tate of the nation, affirmed in the hou&s;e,
that the amount of twelve &s;ub&s;idies was a greater &s;um than
could be found in all England. Such were the happy ignorance
and inexperience those times, with regard to
taxes<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Idem ibid. p. 136.</NOTE>!</P>
<P>THE King was in great doubt and perplexity. He &s;aw,
that his friends in the hou&s;e were out-numbered by his
enemies, and that the &s;ame coun&s;els were &s;till prevalent,
which had ever bred &s;uch oppo&s;ition and di&s;turbance. In|&s;tead
<PB N="289" REF="337">
of hoping, that any &s;upply would be given him, to
carry on war again&s;t the Scots, whom the majority of the
hou&s;e regarded as their be&s;t friends and &s;irme&s;t allies; he
expected every day, that they would pre&s;ent him an addre&s;s
for making peace with tho&s;e rebels. And if the hou&s;e met
again, a vote, he was informed, would certainly pa&s;s, to
bla&s;t his revenue of &s;hip-money: and thereby renew all
the oppo&s;ition, which, with &s;o much difficulty, he had
&s;urmounted, in levying that taxation. Where great evils
lie on all &s;ides, it is very difficult to follow the be&s;t coun|&s;els;
nor is it any wonder, that the King, who&s;e ca|pacity
was not equal to &s;ituations of &s;uch extreme delicacy,
&s;hould ha&s;tily have formed and executed a re&s;olution of di&s;|&s;olving
this parliament:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Di&s;&s;olution.</NOTE> A mea&s;ure, however, of which he
&s;oon after repented, and which the &s;ub&s;eqent events, more
than any convincing rea&s;on, inclined every one to condemn.
The la&s;t parliament, which had ended with &s;uch rigour and
violence, had yet, at fir&s;t, covered their intentions with a
greater appearance of moderation than this parliament had
hitherto a&s;&s;umed.</P>
<P>AN abrupt and violent di&s;&s;olution mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily excite
great, di&s;contents among the people, who u&s;ually put intire
confidence in their repre&s;entatives, and expect from them
the redre&s;s of all grievances. As if there were not already
&s;ufficient grounds of complaint, the King per&s;evered &s;till
in those coun&s;els, which from experience, he might have
been &s;en&s;ible, were &s;o dangerous and unpopular. Bella&s;is
and Sir John Hotham were &s;ummoned before the council;
and refu&s;ing to give any account of then conduct in parliament,
were committed to pri&s;on. All the petitions and
complaints, which had been &s;ent to the committee of reli|gion,
were demanded from Crew, chairman to that com|mittee;
and on his refu&s;al to deliver them, he was &s;ent to
the Tower. The &s;tudies and even the pockets of the Earl
of Warwick and Lord Broke before the expiration of pri|vilege,
<PB N="290" REF="338">
were &s;earched, in expectation of finding trea&s;onable
papers. The&s;e acts of authority were interpreted, with
&s;ome appearance of rea&s;on, to be inva&s;ions on the rights of
national a&s;&s;emblies<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Ru&s;h. vol iii. p. 1167. May p. 61.</NOTE>. But the King, after the fir&s;t provo|cation
which he met with, never re&s;pected &s;ufficiently the
privileges of the parliament; and, by his example, he far|ther
confirmed their, re&s;olution. when they &s;hould acquire
power, to pay like di&s;regard to the prerogatives of the
crown.</P>
<P>THOUGH the parliament was di&s;&s;olved, the convocation
was &s;till allowed to &s;it; a practice, of which, &s;ince the
reformation, there were but few in&s;tances<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">There was one in 1586. See hi&s;tory of Archbi&s;hop Laud, p. 80. The authority of the convocation was indeed quite independent of the parliament, and there was no reason, which required the one to be di&s;&s;olved upon the di&s;&s;olution of the other</NOTE>, and which was
for that rea&s;on &s;uppo&s;ed by many to be irregular. Be&s;ides
granting to the King a &s;upply from the &s;pirituality, and
framing many canons, the convocation, jealous, of like in|novations
with tho&s;e which had taken place in Scotland,
impo&s;ed an oath on the clergy, and the graduates in the
univer&s;ities, by which every one &s;wore to maintain the
e&s;tabli&s;hed government of the church by archbi&s;hops, bi&s;hops,

whom all authority was &s;uppo&s;ed to be centered. And no|thing,
be&s;ides, could afford more &s;ubject of ridicule, than an
oath, which contained an <HI>et caetera</HI> in the mid&s;t of it.</P>
<P>THE people,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Di&s;contents in England</NOTE> who generally abhorred the convocation as
much as they adored the parliament, could &s;carce be
kept from in&s;ulting and abu&s;ing this a&s;&s;embly; and the
King was obliged to give them guards, in order to protect
them<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Idem ibid.</NOTE>. An attack too was made during the night upon

All the&s;e in&s;tances of di&s;content were pre&s;a$es of &s;ome great

the danger, or &s;ufficient power, to provide again&s;t it.</P>
<P>IN this di&s;po&s;ition of mens minds, it was in vain that
the King i&s;&s;ued a declaration, in order to convince his people
of the nece&s;&s;ity, which he lay under, of di&s;&s;olving the la&s;t
parliament<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Ru&s;hworth, volume iii. page 1166.</NOTE>. The chief topic, on which he in&s;i&s;ted, was,
that the commons imitated the bad example of all their pre|dece&s;&s;ors,
of late years, in making continual encroachments
on his authority, in cen&s;uring his Whole admini&s;tration and
conduct, in di&s;cu&s;&s;ing every circum&s;tance of public gover|nment,
and in their indirect bargaining and contracting with
their King for &s;upply; as if nothing ought to be given
him but what he &s;hould purcha&s;e, either by quitting &s;ome|what
of his royal prerogative, or by dimini&s;hing and le&s;&s;ening
his &s;tanding revenue. The&s;e practices, he &s;aid, were con|trary
to the maxims of their ance&s;tors; and the&s;e practices
were totally incompatible with monarchy<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot"><P>IT mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, that the King here touched upon that circum|&s;tance in the Engli&s;h con&s;titution, which it is mo&s;t difficult, or rather alto|ther impo&s;&s;ible, to regulate by laws, and which mu&s;t be governed by certain delicate ideas of propriety and decency, rather than by any exact rule or pre&s;cription. To deny the parliament all right of remon&s;trating again&s;t what they e&s;teem grievances, were to reduce that a&s;&s;embly to a total in&s;igni|ficancy, and to deprive the people of every advantage, which they could reap from popular councils. To complain of the parliament's employing the power of taxation, as the means of extorting conce&s;&s;ions from their &s;ove|reign, were to expect, that they would intirely di&s;arm them&s;elves, and re|nounce the &s;ole expedient, provided by the con&s;titution, for en&s;uring to the kingdom a ju&s;t and legal admini&s;tration. In different periods of Engli&s;h &s;tory, there occur in&s;tances of their remon&s;trating with their princes in the free&s;t manner, and &s;ometimes of their refu&s;ing &s;upply, when di&s;gu&s;ted with any circum&s;tance of public conduct. 'Tis, however, certain, that this power, though e&s;&s;ential to parliaments, may ea&s;ily be abu&s;ed, as well by the frequency and minutene&s;s of their remon&s;trances, as by their intru&s;ion into every part of the King's coun&s;els and determinations. Under colour of ad|vice, they may give, di&s;gui&s;ed orders; and in complaining of grievances, they may draw to them&s;elves every power of government, Whatever mea|&s;ure is embraced, without con&s;ulting them, may be pronounced an oppre&s;&s;ion of the people; and till corrected, they may refu&s;e the mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary &s;up|plies to their indigent &s;overeign. From the very nature of this parliame|ntary liberty, 'tis evident, that it must be left unbounded by law: For who can foretell, how frequently grievances may occur, or what part of admi|ni&s;tration may be affected by them? From the nature too of the human frame, it may be expected, that this liberty would be exerted in its full ex|tent, and no branch of authority be allowed to remain unmole&s;ted in the hands of the prince: For, will the weak limitations of respect and deco|rum be &s;ufficient to re&s;train human ambition, which &s;o frequently breaks through all the pre&s;criptions of law and ju&s;tice?</P>
<P>BUT here it is ob&s;ervable, that the wi&s;dom of the Engli&s;h con&s;titution, or rather, the concurrence of accidents, has. provided, in different periods certain irregular checks to this privilege of parliament, and thereby main|tained, in &s;ome tolerable mea&s;ure, the dignity and authority of the crown.</P>
<P>IN the antient con&s;titution, before the beginning of the &s;eventeenth cen|tury, the meetings of parliament were precarious, and were not frequent. The &s;e&s;&s;ions were very &s;hort; and the members had no lei&s;ure, either to get acquainted with each other, or with public bu&s;ine&s;s. The ignorance of the age made men more &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive to that authority which governed them. And above all, the large deme&s;nes of the crown, with the &s;mall expence of government during that period, rendered the prince almo&s;t independent, and taught the parliament to pre&s;erve a great &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion and duty towards him.</P>
<P>IN our pre&s;ent con&s;titution, many accidents which have rendered, govern|ments, everywhere, as well as in Britain, much, more burthen&s;ome than formerly, have thrown into the hands of the crown the di&s;po&s;al of a very large revenue, and have enabled the King, by the private intere&s;t and ambi|tion of the members, to re&s;train the public intere&s;t and ambition of the body. While the, oppo&s;ition (for we mu&s;t &s;till have an oppo&s;ition, open or di&s;gui&s;ed) endeavours to draw every branch of admini&s;tration under the cog|nizance of parliament, the courtiers re&s;erve a part to the di&s;po&s;al of the crown; and the royal prerogative, though dimini&s;hed of its antient powers, &s;till maintains a due weight in the ballance of the con&s;titution.</P>
<P>IT was the fate of the hou&s;e of Stuart to govern England at a period, when the former &s;ource of authority was already much dimini&s;hed, and be|fore the latter began to flow in any tolerable abundance. Without a regu|lar and fixed foundation, the throne continually tottered; and the prince &s;at upon it anxiou&s;ly and precariou&s;ly. Every expedient, u&s;ed by James and Charles, in order to &s;upport their dignity, we have &s;een attended with &s;en|&s;ible inconveniences. The maje&s;ty of the crown, derived from antient powers and prerogatives, procured re&s;pect; and checked the approaches of in&s;olent intruders: But it begot in the King &s;o high an idea of his own rank and &s;tation, as made him incapable of &s;tooping to popular cour&s;es, or &s;ubmitting, in any degree, to the controul of parliament. The alliance with the hierarchy &s;trengthened law by the &s;anction of religion: But it en|raged the puritanical party, and expo&s;ed the prince to the attacks of ene|mies, numerous, violent, and implacable. The memory too of the&s;e two Kings, from like cau&s;es, has been attended, in &s;ome degree, with the &s;ame infelicity, which pur&s;ued, them during the whole cour&s;e of their lives. Tho' it mu&s;t be con&s;e&s;&s;ed, that their &s;kill in government was not proportioned to the extreme delicacy of their &s;ituation; a &s;ufficient indulgence has not been given them, and all the blame, by &s;everal hi&s;torians, has been unju&s;tly thrown on <HI>their</HI> &s;ide. Their violations of law, particularly tho&s;e of Charles, are &s;ometimes tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions of a plain limit, which was marked out to royal authority. But the encroachments, of the commons, though le&s;s po&s;itive and determinate, are no le&s;s di&s;cernible by good judges, and were equally capable of de&s;troying the ju&s;t ballance of the con&s;titution. While they exerci&s;ed the powers, tran&s;mitted to them, in a manner more independent, and le&s;s complaint than had ever before been practi&s;ed; the Kings were, perhaps imprudently, but, as they imagined; from nece&s;&s;ity, tempted to a&s;&s;ume powers, which had &s;carce ever been exerci&s;ed, or had been exerci&s;ed in a different manner, by the crown. And from the &s;hock of there oppo&s;ite preten&s;ions, together with religious controver&s;y, aro&s;ed all the factions, convul&s;ions, and di&s;orders, which attended that period.</P></NOTE>.</P>

<P>THE pre&s;ent expedients, however, enabled the King,

<P>So great are the effects of zeal and unanimity, that the

To engage them to proceed, be&s;ides their general know|ledge

<PB N="295" REF="343">
had forged a letter,<NOTE PLACE="marg">20th Aug.</NOTE> in the name of &s;ix noblemen, the mo&s;t

to a&s;&s;i&s;t their neighbours, in procuring a redrefs of
their grievances<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Nal&s;on, vol. ii. p. 427.</NOTE>. Notwith&s;tanding the&s;e wariike prepara|tions

were oppo&s;ed by a detachment of 4500 men under Con|way,
who &s;eemed re&s;olute to di&s;pute with them the pa&s;&s;age
of the river. The Scots fir&s;t entreated them, with great
civility, not to &s;top them in their march to their gracious
&s;overeign; and then attacked them with great, bravery,
killed &s;everal, and cha&s;ed the re&s;t from their ground. Such
a panic &s;eized the whole Engli&s;h army, that the forces at
Newca&s;tle fled immediately to Durham; and not yet think|ing
them&s;elves &s;afe, they de&s;erted that town, and retreated,

<P>THE. Scots took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Newca&s;tle; and though

and per&s;evered in their re&s;olution of paying for every|thing,
in order to maintain &s;till the appearance of an amica|ble
corre&s;pondence with England. They al&s;o di&s;patched
me&s;&s;engers to the King, who was arrived at York; and they
took care, after the advantage which they had obtained,
to redouble their expre&s;&s;ions of loyalty, duty, and &s;ubmi&s;|&s;ion
to his per&s;on, and even made apologies, full of &s;orrow
and contrition, for their late victory<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Ru&s;h. vol. iii. p. 1255</NOTE>.</P>
<P>CHARLES was in a very di&s;tre&s;&s;ed &s;ituation, The na|tion
was univer&s;ally and highly di&s;contented. The army
was di&s;couraged, and began likewi&s;e to be di&s;contented, both
<PB N="296" REF="344">
from the contagion of general di&s;gu&s;t, and as an excu&s;e for
their mi&s;behaviour, which they were de&s;irous of repre&s;ent|ing
rather as want of will than of courage to fight. The
trea&s;ury too was quite exhau&s;ted, and eve&s;y expedient for
a &s;upply had been tried to the uttermo&s;t. No event had
happened, but what might have been fore&s;een as nece&s;&s;ary,
or at lea&s;t, as very probable; yet &s;uch was the King's &s;itua|tion,
that no provision could be made, nor was even any
re&s;olution taken again&s;t &s;uch an exigency.</P>
<P>IN order to prevent the advance of the Scots upon him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Treaty at Rippon.</NOTE> the
King agreed to a treaty, and named &s;ixteen Engli&s;h noblemen,
who met with eleven Scots commi&s;&s;ioners at Rippon. The
Earls of Hertford, Bedford, Sali&s;bury, Warwick, E&s;&s;ex, Hol|land,
Bri&s;tol, and Berk&s;hire, the Lords Kimbolton, Whar|ton,
Dun&s;more, Paget, Broke, Saville, Paulet, and How|ard
of E&s;cric, were cho&s;en by the King; all of them popu|lar
men, and con&s;equently &s;uppo&s;ed no-wife aver&s;e to the
Scots inva&s;ion, nor unacceptable to that nation<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Clarendon, vol. i. p. 155.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>AN addre&s;s arrived from the city of London, petitioning
for a parliament; the great point, to which all mens pro|jects
at this $me tended<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Ru&s;h. vol. iii. p. 1263.</NOTE>. Twelve noblemen pre&s;ented a
petition to the &s;ame purpo&s;e<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Cla|rendon, vol. i. p. 146. Ru&s;h. vol. iii. p. 1260, May, p. 66. Warwick, p. 151.</NOTE>. But the King contented
him&s;elf with &s;ummoning a great council of the peers to
York; a mea&s;ure, which had formerly been taken in ca&s;es
of &s;udden emergency, but which, at pre&s;ent, could &s;erve
to no manner of purpo&s;e. Perhaps, the King, who dreaded,
above all things, the hou&s;e of commons, and who ex|pected
no &s;upply from them on any rea&s;onable terms,
thought, that in his pre&s;ent urgent di&s;tre&s;&s;es, he might
be enabled to levy &s;ub&s;idies by the authority of the peers
alone. But the employing, &s;o long, a plea of nece&s;&s;ity
<PB N="297" REF="345">
which was very di&s;tant and doubtful, rendered it impo&s;&s;ible
for him to avail him&s;elf of a nece&s;&s;ity, which was now at
la&s;t become real, urgent, and inevitable.</P>
<P>BY Northumberland's &s;ickne&s;s, the command of the army
had devolved on Strafford. That nobleman po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed more
vigour of mind than the King or any of the council. He
advi&s;ed Charles rather to put all to hazard, than &s;ubmit
to &s;uch unworthy terms as were likely to be impo&s;ed upon
him. The lo&s;s &s;u&s;tained at Newburn, he &s;aid was in|con&s;iderable;
and though a panic had, for the time, &s;eized
the army, that was nothing &s;trange among new levied
troops; and the Scots, being in the &s;ame condition, would,
no doubt, be liable, in their turn, to a like accident. His
opinion, therefore, was, that the King &s;hould pu&s;h for|ward,
and attack the Scots, and bring the affair to a quick:
deci&s;ion; and, if he was ever &s;o un&s;ucce&s;sful, nothing wor&s;e
could befal him, than what, from his inactivity, he would
certainly be expo&s;ed to<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Nal&s;on, vol. ii. p. 5.</NOTE>, To &s;how how ea&s;y it would be
to execute this project, he ordered an a&s;&s;ault to be made on
&s;ome quarters of the Scots, and he gained an advantage
over them. No ce&s;&s;ation of arms had, as yet, been agreed
to, during the treaty at Rippon; yet great clamour pre|vailed,
on account of this act of ho&s;tility. And when it
was known, that the officer, who conducted the attack,
was a papi&s;t, a violent outcry was rai&s;ed again&s;t the King,
for employing that hated &s;ect, in the murder of his pro|te&s;tant
&s;ubjects<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Clarendon, vol. i. p. 159.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IT may be worthy of remark, that &s;everal mutinies had
ari&s;en among the Engli&s;h, troops, when marching to join
the army; and &s;ome officers had been murdered, merely
on the &s;u&s;picion of their being papi&s;ts<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Ru&s;h. vol. iii. p. 1190, 1191, 1192, &amp;c. May, p. 64.</NOTE>. The petition of
right had aboli&s;hed all martial law; and by an inconveni|ence
<PB N="298" REF="346">
which naturally attended the plan,. as yet new and
unformed, of regular and rigid liberty, it was found ab|&s;olutely
impo&s;&s;ible for the generals to govern the army, by
all the authority which the King could legally confer upon
them. The lawyers had declared, that martial law could not
be exerci&s;ed, except in the very pre&s;ence of an enemy; and
becau&s;e it had been found nece&s;&s;ary to execute a mutineer,
the generals thought it advi&s;eable, for their &s;afety, to apply
for a pardon from the crown. This weakne&s;s, however,
was carefully concealed from the army; and Lord Conway
&s;aid, that, if any lawyer was &s;o imprudent as to di&s;cover
the &s;ecret to the &s;oldiers, it would be nece&s;&s;ary in&s;tantly to
refute him, and to hang the lawyer him&s;elf, by &s;entence of
a court&horbar;martial<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Ru&s;h. vol. iii. p. 1199.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>AN army new levied, undi&s;ciplined, frightened, &s;editious,

<P>THE cau&s;es of di&s;gu&s;t, which, for above thirty years,
had every day been multiplying in England, were
now come to full maturity, and threatened the kingdom
with &s;ome great revolution or convul&s;ion. The uncertain
and undefined limits of prerogative and privilege had been
eagerly di&s;puted during that whole period; and in every
controver&s;y between prince and people, the que&s;tion, how|ever
doubtful, had always been decided, by each party, in
favour of its own preten&s;ions. Too lightly moved by the
appearance of nece&s;&s;ity, the King had even a&s;&s;umed powers
incompatible with the principles of limited government, and
had rendered it impo&s;&s;ible for his mo&s;t zealous partizans
intirely to ju&s;tify his conduct, except by topics &s;o odious,
that they were more &s;itted, in the pre&s;ent di&s;po&s;ition of mens
minds, to inflame, than appea&s;e, the general di&s;content.
Tho&s;e great &s;upports of public authority, law and religion,
had likewi&s;e, by the unbounded compliance of judges and
prelates, lo&s;t much of their influence over the people; or
rather, had in a great mea&s;ure gone over to the &s;ide of fac|tion,
and authorized the &s;pirit of oppo&s;ition and rebellion.
<PB N="301" REF="349">
The nobility,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. LIV.</NOTE> likewi&s;e, whom the King had no means of
retaining by offices and preferments &s;uitable to their rank,
had been &s;eized with the general di&s;content, and unwarily
threw them&s;elves into the &s;cale, which began already too
much to preponderate. Sen&s;ible of &s;ome encroachments
which had been made by royal authority, men entertained no
jealou&s;y of the commons, who&s;e enterpri&s;es, for the acqui|&s;ition
of power, had ever been covered with the appearance
of public good, and had hitherto gone no farther than &s;ome
di&s;appointed efforts and endeavours. The progre&s;s of the
Scots malecontents reduced the crown to an intire depend|ence
for &s;upply: Their union with the popular party in
England brought great acce&s;&s;ion of authority to the latter:
The near pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s rou&s;ed all the latent murmurs
and preten&s;ions of the nation, which had hitherto been held
in &s;uch violent con&s;traint: And the torrent of general in|clination
and opinion ran &s;o &s;trong again&s;t the count, that the
King was in no &s;itnation to refu&s;e any rea&s;onable preten&s;ions
of the popular leaders, either for defining or limiting the
powers of his prerogative. Even many exorbitant claims,
in the pre&s;ent &s;ituation, would probably be made, and mu&s;t
nece&s;&s;arily be complied with.</P>
<P>THE triumph of the malecontents over the church was
not yet &s;o immediate or certain. Tho' the political and re|ligious
puritans mutually lent a&s;&s;i&s;tance to each other, there
were many who joined the former, and yet declined all
manner of connexion with the latter. The hierarchy had
been e&s;tabli&s;hed in England ever &s;ince the reformation: The
Romi&s;h church, in all ages, had carefully maintained that
form of eccle&s;ia&s;tical government: The antient fathers too
bore te&s;timony to epi&s;copal juri&s;diction: And tho' parity
may &s;eem at fir&s;t to have had place among chri&s;tian pa&s;tors,
the period, during which it prevailed, was &s;o &s;hort, that
few undi&s;puted traces of it remained in hi&s;lory. The bi&s;hops
and their more zealous partizans inferred thence, the divine
<PB N="302" REF="350">
indefeizable right of prelacy: Others regarded that in&s;titu|tion
as venerable and u&s;eful: And, if the love of novelty led
&s;ome to adopt the new rites and di&s;cipline of the puritans;
the reverence to antiquity retained many in their attachment
to the liturgy and government of the church. It behoved,
therefore, the zealous innovators in parliament to proceed
with &s;ome caution and re&s;erve. By promoting all mea&s;ures
which reduced the exorbitant powers of the crown, they
hoped to di&s;arm the King, whom they ju&s;tly regarded, from
principle, inclination, and policy, to be the determined pa|tron
of the hierarchy. By declaiming again&s;t the &s;uppo&s;ed
encroachments and tyranny of the prelates, they endeavoured
to carry the nation, from a hatred of their per&s;ons, to an
oppo&s;ition again&s;t their office and character. And when
men were inli&s;ted in party, it would not be difficult, they
thought, to lead them by degrees into many mea&s;ures, for
which they formerly entertained the greate&s;t aver&s;ion. Tho'
the new &s;ectaries compo&s;ed not, at fir&s;t, the majority of the
nation, they were inflamed, as is u&s;ual among innovators,
with extreme zeal for their opinions. Their un&s;urmount|able
pa&s;&s;ion, di&s;gui&s;ed to them&s;elves, as well as to others,
under the appearance of holy fervours, was well qualified
to make pro&s;elytes, and to &s;eize the minds of the ignorant
multitude. And one furious enthu&s;ia&s;t was able, by his
active indu&s;try, to &s;urmount the indolent efforts of many
$ober and rea&s;onable antagoni&s;ts.</P>
<P>WHEN the nation, therefore, was &s;o generally di&s;con|tented,
and little &s;u&s;picion was entertained of any de&s;ign to
&s;ubvert the church and monarchy; no wonder, that almo&s;t
all elections ran in favour of tho&s;e, who, by their high pre|ten&s;ious
to piety and patrioti&s;m, had encouraged the national
prejudices. 'Tis an u&s;ual compliment to regard the King's
inclination in the choice of a &s;peaker; and Charles had in|tended
to advance Gardiner, recorder of London, to that
important tru&s;t: But &s;o little intere&s;t did the crown, at that
time, po&s;&s;e&s;s in the nation, that Gardiner was di&s;appointed
<PB N="303" REF="351">
of his election, not only in London, but in every other
place where it was attempted: And the King was obliged
to make the choice of &s;peaker fall on Lenthal, a lawyer of
&s;ome character, but not &s;ufficiently qualified for &s;o high and
difficult an office<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Clarendon, vol. i. p. 169.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE eager expectations of men with regard to a parlia|ment,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Meeting of the long parliment, Nov. 3.</NOTE> &s;ummoned at &s;o critical a juncture, and during &s;uch
general di&s;contents; a parliament, which, from the &s;itua|tion
of public affairs, could not be abruptly di&s;&s;olved, and
which was to execute every thing left unfini&s;hed by former
parliaments; the&s;e views, &s;o important and intere&s;ting, en|gaged
the attendance of all the members; and the hou&s;e of
commons was never ob&s;erved to be, from the beginning, &s;o
numerous and frequent. Without, any interval, therefore,
they entered upon bu&s;ine&s;s, and by unanimous con&s;ent they
immediately &s;truck a blow, which may, in a manner, be
regarded as deci&s;ive.</P>
<P>THE Earl of Strafford was con&s;idered as chief mini&s;ter
of &s;tate, both on account of the credit which he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed
with his ma&s;ter, and of his own great and uncommon vi|gour
and capacity. By a concurrence of accidents, this
man laboured under the &s;evere hatred of all the three na|tions
which compo&s;ed the Briti&s;h monarchy. The Scots,
who&s;e authority now ran extremely high, looked on him as
the capital enemy of their country, and one who&s;e coun&s;els
and influence they had mo&s;t rea&s;on to apprehend. He had
engaged the parliament of Ireland to advance large &s;ub&s;idies,
in order to &s;upport a war again&s;t them: He had levied an
army of 9000 men, with which he had menaced all their
We&s;tern coa&s;t: He had obliged the Scots, who lived under
his government, to renounce the covenant, their national
idol: He had in Ireland proclaimed the Scots covenanters
rebels and traitors, even before the King had i&s;&s;ued any
<PB N="304" REF="352">
&s;uch declaration again&s;t them in England: And he had ever
di&s;&s;uaded his ma&s;ter again&s;t the late treaty and &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of
arms, which he regarded as dangerous and di&s;honourable.
So avowed and violent were the Scots in their re&s;entment of
all the&s;e mea&s;ures, that they had refu&s;ed, to &s;end commi&s;|&s;ioners
to treat at York, as was fir&s;t propo&s;ed; becau&s;e,
they &s;aid, the lieutenant of Ireland, their capital enemy,
being general of the King's forces, had there the chief com|mand
and authority.</P>
<P>STRAFFORD, fir&s;t as deputy, then as lord lieutenant,
had governed Ireland during eight years with great vigilance,
activity, and prudence, but with very litde popularity. In
a nation &s;o aver&s;e to the Engli&s;h government and religion,
the&s;e very virtues were &s;ufficient to draw on him the public
hatred. The manners too and character of this great man,
tho' to all full of courte&s;y, and to his friends full of af|fection,
were, at bottom, haughty, rigid, and &s;evere. His
authority and influence, during the time of his govern|ment,
had been unlimited; but no &s;ooner did adver&s;ity
&s;eize him, than the concealed aver&s;ion of the nation blazed
up at once, and the Iri&s;h parliament u&s;ed every expedient
to aggravate the charge again&s;t him.</P>
<P>THE univer&s;al di&s;content, which prevailed in England
again&s;t the court; was all pointed towards the Earl of Straf|ford;
tho' without any particular rea&s;on, but becau&s;e he
was the mini&s;ter of &s;tate, whom the King mo&s;t favoured
and mo&s;t tru&s;ted. His extraction was honourable, his pa|ternal
fortune con&s;iderable: Yet envy attended his &s;udden
and great elevation. And his former a&s;&s;ociates in popular
councils, finding that he owed his advancement to the de|&s;ertion
of their cau&s;e, repre&s;ented him as the great apo&s;tate
of the commonwealth, whom it behoved them to &s;acrifice,
as a victim to public ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>STRAFFORD, &s;en&s;ible of the load of popular prejudices.
Under which he laboured, would gladly have declined at|tendance
<PB N="305" REF="353">
on the parliament; and he begged the King's per|mi&s;&s;ion
to withdraw him&s;elf to his government of Ireland,
or at lea&s;t to remain at the head of the army in York&s;hire;
wheremany opportunities, he hoped, would offer, by rea|&s;on
of his di&s;tance, to elude the attacks of his enemies.
But Charles, who had intire confidence in the Earl's capa|city,
thought that his coun&s;els would be extremely u&s;eful
during the critical &s;e&s;&s;ion which approached. And when
Sta&s;ford &s;til in&s;i&s;ted on the danger of appearing amid&s;t &s;o
many enraged enemies, the King, little apprehen&s;ive that
his own authority was &s;o &s;uddenly to expire, promi&s;ed him
protection, and a&s;&s;ured him, that not a hair of his head
&s;hould be touched by the parliament<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Whitlocke, p. 36.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>No &s;ooner was Strafford's arrival known,<NOTE PLACE="marg">11th Nov.</NOTE> than a concerted
attack was made upon him in the hou&s;e of commons. Pym,
in a long, &s;tudied di&s;cour&s;e, divided into many heads after
his manner, enumerated all the grievances under which the
nation, laboured; and, from a complication of &s;uch op|pre&s;&s;ions,
inferred, that a deliberate plan had been formed of
changing intirely, the frame of government, and &s;ubverting
the antient laws and liberties of the kingdom<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Idem ibid.</NOTE>. Could any
thing, he &s;aid, increa&s;e our indignation again&s;t &s;o enormous
and criminal a project, it would be to find, that, during
the reign of the be&s;t of princes, the con&s;titution had been
endangered by the wor&s;t of mini&s;ters, and that the virtues
of the King had been &s;educed by wicked and pernicious
coun&s;els. We mu&s;t inquire, added he, from what fountain
the&s;e waters of bitterne&s;s flow; and tho' doubtie&s;s many
evil coun&s;ellors will be found to have contributed their en|deavours,
yet there is one who challenges the infamous pre|eminence,
and who, by his courage, enterprize, and capa|city
is intitled to the fir&s;t place among the&s;e betrayers of
their country. HE is the Earl of Strafford, lieutenant of
Ireland, and pre&s;ident of the council of York, who, in both
<PB N="306" REF="354">
places, and in all other provinces where he has been en|tru&s;ted
with authority, has rai&s;ed ample monuments of ty|ranny,
and will appear, from a &s;urvey of his actions, to be
the chief promoter of every arbitrary coun&s;el. Some in|&s;tances
of imperious expre&s;&s;ions, as well as actions, were
given by Pym; who afterwards entered into a more per&s;onal
attack of that mini&s;ter, and endeavoured to expo&s;e his whole
character and manners. The au&s;tere genius of Strafford,
occupied in the pur&s;uits of ambition, had not rendered his
brea&s;t altogether inacce&s;&s;ible to the tender pa&s;&s;ions, or &s;e|cured
him from the dominion of the fair;and in that &s;ullen
age, when the irregularities of plea&s;ure were more reproach|ful
than the mo&s;t odious crimes, the&s;e weakne&s;&s;es were
thought worthy of being mentioned, together with his trea|&s;ons,
before &s;o great an a&s;&s;embly. And upon the whole,
the orator concluded, that it belonged to the hou&s;e to pro|vide
a remedy proportionable to the di&s;ea&s;e, and to prevent
the farther mi&s;chiefs ju&s;tly to be apprehended from the in|fluence
which this man had acquired over the mea&s;ures and
coun&s;els of their &s;overeign<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Clarendon, vol. i. p. 17.</NOTE></P>
<P>SIR John Clotworthy an Iri&s;h gentleman, Sir John Ho|tham
of York&s;hire, and many others, entered into the &s;ame
topics: And after &s;everal hours &s;pent in bitter invective,
when the doors were locked, in order to prevent all di&s;co|very
of their, purpo&s;e; it was moved, in con&s;equence of
the re&s;olution &s;ecretly taken, that Strafford &s;hould imme|diately
be impeached of high trea&s;on. This motion was
received with univer&s;al approbation; nor was there, in all
the debate, one per&s;on who offered to &s;top the torrent by
any te&s;timony in favour of the Earl's conduct. Lord
Falkland alone, tho' known to be his enemy, modei&s;tly de|&s;ired
the hou&s;e to con&s;ider, whether it would not better
fuit the gravity of their proceedings, fir&s;t to dige&s;t, by a
committee, many of tho&s;e particulars which had been men|tioned
<PB N="307" REF="355">
before they &s;ent up an accu&s;ation again&s;t, him.
It was ingenuou&s;ly an&s;wered by Pym, That &s;uch a delay might
probably bla&s;t all their hopes, and put it out of their power
to proceed any farther in the pro&s;ecution: That when Straf|ford
&s;hould learn, that &s;o; many of his enormities were di&s;|covered,
his con&s;cience would dictate his condemnation;
and &s;o great was his power and credit, he would immedi|ately
procure the di&s;&s;olution of the parliament, or attempt
&s;ome other de&s;perate mea&s;ure for his own pre&s;ervation:
That the commons were only accu&s;ers, not judges; and
it was the province of the peers to determine, whether &s;uch
a complication of enormous crimes in one per&s;on, did not
amount to the highe&s;t crime known by the law<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Clarendon, vol. i. p. 174</NOTE>. Without
farther debate, the accu&s;ation was voted: Pym was cho&s;en
to carry up the impeachment: Mo&s;t of the hou&s;e accom|panied
him on &s;o agreeable an errand: And Strafford, who
had ju&s;t entered the hou&s;e of peers, and who little expected
&s;o &s;peedy a pro&s;ecution, was immediately, upon this general
charge, ordered into cu&s;tody, with &s;everal &s;ymptoms of
violent prejudice in his judges, as well as in his pro&s;e|cutors.</P>
<P>IN the inquiry concerning grievances and the cen&s;ure of
pa&s;t mea&s;ures,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Laud im|peached</NOTE> Laud could not long e&s;cape the &s;evere &s;cru|tiny
of the commons; who were led too in their accu&s;a|tion
of that prelate as well by their prejudices again&s;t his
whole order, as by the extreme antipathy which his intem|perate
zeal had drawn upon him. After a deliberation
which &s;carce li&s;ted half an hour, an impeachment of high
trea&s;on was re&s;olved on again&s;t this &s;ubject:, the fir&s;t, both
in rank and in favour, throughout the kingdom. Though
this incident, con&s;idering the example of Stafford's im|peachment
and the pre&s;ent di&s;po&s;ition of the nation and
parliament, needed be no &s;urprize to him; yet was he be|trayed
into &s;ome pa&s;&s;ion, when the accu&s;ation was pre&s;ented.
<PB N="308" REF="356">
<HI>The commons them&s;elves,</HI> he &s;aid, <HI>though his accu&s;ers, did
not believe him guilty of the crimes with which they charged
him:</HI> An indi&s;cretion, which, next day, upon more mature
deliberation, he de&s;ired leave to retract; but &s;o little favour|able
were the peers, that they refu&s;ed him this advantage
or indulgence. Laud was immediately, upon this general
charge, &s;eque&s;tered from parliament, and committed to cu&s;|tody<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Clarendon, vol. i. p. 177. Whitlocke, P. 38. Ru&s;hworth, vol. iii. P, 1365.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE capital article,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lord keeper Finch flies.</NOTE> in&s;i&s;ted on again&s;t the&s;e two great
men, was the de&s;ign which the commons &s;uppo&s;ed to have
been formed for &s;ubverting the laws and con&s;titution of
England, and introducing arbitrary and unlimited authority
into the kingdom. Of all the King's mini&s;ters, no one was
&s;o obnoxious in this re&s;pect as the lord keeper, Finch. He
it was, who, being &s;peaker in the King's third parliament,
had left the chair, and refu&s;ed to put the que&s;tion, when
ordered by the hou&s;e. The extrajudicial opinion of the
judges in the ca&s;e of &s;hip-money had been procured by his
intrigues, per&s;ua&s;ions, and even menaces. In all unpopular
and illegal mea&s;ures, he was ever mo&s;t active; and he was
even believed to have declared publickly, that while he was
keeper, an order of the council &s;hould always with him be
equivalent to a law. To appea&s;e the ri&s;ing di&s;plea&s;ure of
the commons, he de&s;ired to be heard at their bar. He
pro&s;trated him&s;elf with all humility before them; but this
&s;ubmi&s;&s;ion availed him nothing. An impeachment was re|&s;olved
on; and in order to e&s;cape their fury, he thought
proper &s;ecretly to withdraw, and to retire into Holland. As
he was not e&s;teemed equal to Strafford, or even to Laud,
either in capacity or in &s;idelity to his ma&s;ter; it was gene|rally
believed, that his e&s;cape had been connived at by the
popular leaders<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Clarendon, vol. i. p. 177. Whitlocke, P. 38. Ru&s;hworth, vol. i. p. 129, 136.</NOTE>. His impeachment, however, in his ab|&s;ence,
was carried up to the hou&s;e of peers.</P>
<P><PB N="309" REF="357">
SIR Francis Windebank, the &s;ecretary, was a creature of,
Laud; and that was &s;ufficient rea&s;on for his being ex|tremely
obnoxious to the commons. He was &s;ecretly &s;u|&s;pected
too of the crime of popery; and it was known,
that, from complai&s;ance to the Queen, and indeed in comp|liance
with the King's maxims of government, he had
granted many indulgences to catholics, and had &s;igned war|rants
for the pardon of prie&s;ts, and their delivery from con|finement.
Grim&s;tone, a popular member, called him, in
the hou&s;e, the very pander and broker to the whore of
Babylon<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Ru&s;hworth, vol. v. p. 122.</NOTE>, Finding that the &s;crutiny of the commons was
pointing towards him, and being &s;en&s;ible that England was
no longer a place of &s;afety for men of his character, he &s;ud|denly
made his e&s;cape into France<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Clarendon, vol. i. p. 178. Whit|locke, p. 37.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THUS, in a few weeks, this hou&s;e of commons, not op|po&s;ed
or rather &s;econded by the peers, had produced &s;uch
a revolution in the government, that the two mo&s;t powerful
and mo&s;t favoured mini&s;ters of the King were thrown into the
Tower, and daily expected to be tried for their life: Two
other mini&s;ters had, by &s;light alone, &s;aved them&s;elves from
a like fate: All the King's &s;ervants &s;aw evidently, that no
protection could be given them by their ma&s;ter: A new
juri&s;diction was erected in the nation; and before that tri|bunal
all tho&s;e trembled, who had before exulted moil in
their credit and authority.</P>
<P>WHAT rendered the power of the commons the more
&s;ormidable,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Great au|thority of the com|mons.</NOTE> was, the extreme prudence with which it was
conducted. Not contented with the authority which they
had acquired by attacking the&s;e great mini&s;ters, they were
re&s;olved to render the mo&s;t con&s;iderable bodies of the na|tion
obnoxious to them. Tho' the idol of the people, they
determined to fortify them&s;elves likewi&s;e with terrors, and
<PB N="310" REF="358">
to overawe tho&s;e who might &s;till be inclined to &s;upport the
falling ruins of monarchy.</P>
<P>DURING the ate military operations, &s;everal powers had
been exerted by the heute$an$s and deputy-lieutenants of
the counties: And the&s;e powers, though nece&s;&s;ary for the
defence of the nation, and even warranted by all former
precedents, yet not being authorized by &s;tatute, were now
voted to be illegal; and the por&s;ons who had a&s;&s;umed them,
declared <HI>delinquents.</HI> This term was newly come into
vogue, and expre&s;&s;ed a degree and &s;pecies of guilt not ex|actly
known nor a&s;certained. In con&s;equence of that deter|mination,
many of the nobility and prime gentry of the
nation, while only exerting, as they ju&s;tly thought, the
legal powers of magi&s;tracy, unexpectedly found them&s;elves
involved in the crime of delinquency. And the commons
reaped this multiplied advantage by their vote: They di&s;|armed
the crown; they, e&s;tabli&s;hed the maxims of rigid
law and liberty; and they &s;pread the terror of their own
authority<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Clarendon, vol. i. p. 176.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE writs for &s;hip-money had been directed to the &s;he|riffs,
who were required, and even obliged under &s;evere pe|nalties,
to a&s;&s;e&s;s the &s;ums upon individuals, and to levy
them by their authority: Yet were all the &s;heriffs, and all
tho&s;e employed in that illegal &s;ervice, voted by a very ri|gorous
&s;entence, to be delinquents. The King, by the
maxims of law, could do no wrong: His mini&s;ters and &s;er|vants,
of whatever degree, in ca&s;e of any violation of the
con&s;titution, were alone culpable<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Idem ibid.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>ALL the farmers and officers of the cu&s;toms, who had
been employed, during &s;o many years, in levying tonnage
and poundage and the new impo&s;itions, were likewi&s;e de|clared
criminal, and were afterwards glad to compound for
a pardon by paying a fine of 150,000 pounds.</P>

EVERY di&s;cretionary or arbitrary &s;entence of the &s;tar|chamber
and high commi&s;&s;ion; courts, which, from their
very con&s;titution, were arbitrary; underwent a &s;evere &s;cru|tiny:
And all tho&s;e, who had any hand in &s;uch &s;entences,

<P>THE judges, who had given their votes again&s;t Hamb|den
in the trial of &s;hip-money, were accu&s;ed before the

of the parties<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Clarendon, vol. i. p. 176.</NOTE>. Mens pa&s;&s;ions were too much
heated to be &s;hocked with any in&s;tance of inju&s;tice, which
&s;erved ends &s;o popular as tho&s;e pur&s;ued by this hou&s;e of
commons.</P>
<P>THE whole &s;overeign power being thus in a manner
transferred to the commons, and the government, without
any &s;eeming violence or di&s;order, changed, in a moment,
from a monarchy almo&s;t ab&s;olute; to a pure democracy;
the popular leaders &s;eemed willing for &s;ome time to &s;u&s;pend
their active vigour, and to con&s;olidate their authority ere
they proceeded to any violent exerci&s;e of it. Every day
produced &s;ome new harangue on pa&s;t grievances. The de|te&s;tation
<PB N="313" REF="361">
of former u&s;urpations, was farther enlivened: The
jealou&s;y of liberty rou&s;ed: And agreeable to the true &s;pirit
of free government, an equal indignation was excited, by
the view of a violated con&s;titution, as by the ravages of the
mo&s;t enormous tyranny.</P>
<P>Now was the time when genius and capacity of all kinds,
freed from the re&s;traint of authority, and nouri&s;hed by un|bounded
hopes and projects, began to exert them&s;elves, and
be di&s;tingui&s;hed by the public. Then was celebrated the
&s;agacity of Pym, more, fitted for u&s;e than ornament; matured,
not chilled, by his advanced age and long experience: Then
was di&s;played the mighty ambition of Hambden, taught di&s;|gui&s;e,
not moderation, from former con&s;traint; &s;upported by
courage, conducted by prudence, embelli&s;hed by mode&s;ty;
but whether founded in a love of power or zeal for liberty,
is &s;till, from his untimely end, left doubtful and uncertain:
Then too were known the dark, ardent, and dangerous
character of St. John; the impetuous &s;pirit of Hollis, vio|lent
and &s;incere, open and intire in his enmities and in his
friend&s;hips; the enthu&s;ia&s;tic genius of young Vane, extra|vagant
in the ends which he pur&s;ued, &s;agacious and pro|found
in the means which he employed; incited by the
appearances of religion, negligent of the duties of mora|lity.</P>
<P>So little apology would be received for pa&s;t mea&s;ures, &s;o
contagious the general &s;pirit of di&s;content, that even men
of the mo&s;t moderate tempers, and the mo&s;t attached to the
church and monarchy, exerted them&s;elves with the utmo&s;t
vigour in the redre&s;s of grievances, and in pro&s;ecuting the
authors of them. The lively and animated Digby di&s;|played
his eloquence on this occa&s;ion, the firm and un|daunted
Capel, the mode&s;t and candid Palmer. In this li&s;t
too of patriot-royali&s;ts are found the virtuous names of
Hyde and Falkland. Tho' in their ultimate views and in|tentions,
the&s;e men differed widely from the former; in
<PB N="314" REF="362">
their pre&s;ent actions and di&s;cour&s;es, an intire concurrence
and unanimity was ob&s;erved.</P>
<P>BY the daily harangues and invectives again&s;t illegal
u&s;urpations, not only the hou&s;e of commons inflamed them|&s;elves
with the highe&s;t animo&s;ity towards the court: The
nation caught new fire from the popular leaders, and &s;eemed
now to have made the fir&s;t di&s;covery of the many di&s;orders
of the government. While the law, in many in&s;tances,
&s;eemed to be violated, they went no farther than &s;ome &s;e|cret
and calm murmurs; but mounted up into rage and
fury, as &s;oon as the con&s;titution was thought to be re&s;tored
to its former integrity and vigour. The capital e&s;pecially,
being, the &s;eat of parliament, was highly animated with the
&s;pirit of mutiny and di&s;affection. Tumults were daily
rai&s;ed; &s;editious a&s;&s;emblies encouraged; and every man,
neglecting his own bu&s;ine&s;s, was wholly intent on the de+fence
of liberty and religion. By &s;tronger contagion, the
popular affections were communicated from brea&s;t to brea&s;t,
in this place of general rendezvous and &s;ociety.</P>
<P>THE harangues of members, now fir&s;t publi&s;hed and
di&s;per&s;ed, kept alive the di&s;contents again&s;t the King's ad|mini&s;tration.
The pulpits, delivered over to puritanical
preachers and lecturers, whom the commons arbitrarily
&s;ettled in all the con&s;iderable churches, re&s;ounded with fac|tion
and fanatici&s;m. Vengeance was fully taken for that
long &s;ilence and con&s;traint, in which, by the authority of
Laud and the high commi&s;&s;ion, the&s;e preachers had been
retained. The pre&s;s, freed from all fear or re&s;erve, &s;warmed
with productions, dangerous by their &s;editious zeal and ca|lumny
more than by any art or eloquence of compo&s;ition.
Noi&s;e and fury, cant and hypocri&s;y, formed the &s;ole rhe|toric,
which, during this tumult of various prejudices and
pa&s;&s;ions, could be heard or attended to.</P>
<P>THE &s;evere &s;entence, which had been executed again&s;t
Prynne, Ba&s;twic, and Burton, now &s;uffered a revi&s;al from
<PB N="315" REF="363">
parliament. The&s;e libellers, far from being tamed by the
rigorous puni&s;hments which they had undergone, &s;howed
&s;till a di&s;po&s;ition of repeating the$ offence; and the mini|&s;ters
were afraid, le&s;t new &s;atires &s;hould i&s;&s;ue from their
pri&s;ons, and inflame &s;till farther the prevailing di&s;contents.
By an order, therefore, of the council, they had been re|moved
to remote pri&s;ons; Ba&s;twic to Scilly, Prynne to
Jer&s;ey, Burton to Guern&s;ey; all acce&s;s to them was denied;
and the u&s;e of books, and of pen, ink, and paper, was
refu&s;ed them. The &s;entence for the&s;e additional puni&s;h|ments
was immediately rever&s;ed by the commons: Even the
fir&s;t &s;entence, upon examination, was declared illegal; and
the judges, who pa&s;&s;ed it, were ordered to make reparation
to the &s;ufferers<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Nal&s;on, vol. i. p. 783. May, p. 79.</NOTE>. When the pri&s;oners landed in England,
they were received and entertained with the highe&s;t demon|&s;trations
of affection, were attended with a mighty conflu|ence
of company, their charges were borne with great mag|nificence,
and liberal pre&s;ents be&s;towed on them. On their
approach to any town, all the inhabitants crowded to re|ceive
them, and welcomed their reception with &s;houts and
acclamations. Their train &s;till increa&s;ed, as they drew near
to London. Several miles from the city, the zealots of
their party met them in great multitudes, and attended
their triumphant entrance: Boughs were carried in this
tumultuous proce&s;&s;ion; the roads were &s;trewed with
flowers; and amid&s;t the highe&s;t exultations of joy, were
intermingled loud and virulent invectives again&s;t the pre|lates,
who had &s;o cruelly per&s;ecued &s;uch godly per&s;onages<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Clarendon, vol. i. p. 199, 200, &amp;c. Nal&s;on, vol. i. p. 570. May, p. 80.</NOTE>.
The more ignoble the&s;e men were, the more &s;en&s;ible was
the in&s;ult upon royal authority, and the more dangerous
was the &s;pirit of di&s;affection and mutiny which it di&s;covered
among the people.</P>
<P><PB N="316" REF="364">
LILBURNE, Leighton, and every one who had been pu|ni&s;hed
for &s;editious libels during the precedent admini&s;tration,
now recovered their liberty, and were decreed damages on
the judges and mini&s;ters of ju&s;tice<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Ru&s;h. vol. v. p. 228. Nal&s;on, vol. i. p. 800.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>NOT only the pre&s;ent di&s;po&s;ition of the nation en&s;ured
impunity to all libellers: A new method of framing and
di&s;per&s;ing libels was invented by the leaders of popular di&s;|content.
Petitions to parliament were drawn, craving re|dre&s;s
again&s;t particular grievances; and when a &s;ufficient
number of &s;ub&s;criptions were procured, the potitions were
pre&s;ented to the commons, and immediately publi&s;hed.
The&s;e petitions became &s;ecret bonds of a&s;&s;ociation among
the &s;ub&s;cribers, and &s;eemed to give undoubted &s;anction and
authority to the complaints which they contained.</P>
<P>'TIS pretended by hi&s;torians favourable to the royal
cau&s;e<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Dugdale. Cla|rendon, vol. i. p. 203.</NOTE>, and even a&s;&s;erted by the King him&s;elf in a declara|tion
<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Hu&s;b. Coll. p. 536.</NOTE>, that a mo&s;t di&s;ingenuous or rather criminal practice
prevailed, in conducting many of the&s;e addre&s;&s;es. A peti|tion
was fir&s;t framed; moderate, rea&s;onable, &s;uch as men
of character willingly &s;ub&s;cribed. The names were after|wards
torn off, and affixed to another petition, which &s;erved
better the purpo&s;es of the popular faction. We may judge
of the wild fury which prevailed throughout the nation,
when &s;o &s;candalous an impo&s;ture, which affected &s;uch num|bers
of people, could be openly practi&s;ed, without draw|ing
infamy and ruin upon the managers.</P>
<P>So many grievances were offered, both by the members,
and by petitions without-doors, that the hou&s;e was divided
into above forty committees, charged, each of them, with
the examination of &s;ome particular violation of law and
liberty which had been complained of. Be&s;ides the general
committees of religion, trade, privileges, laws; many &s;ub|divi&s;ions
of the&s;e were framed, and a &s;trict &s;crutiny was
<PB N="317" REF="365">
every-where carried on. 'Tis to be remarked, that, before
the beginning of this century, when the parliament a&s;&s;umed
le&s;s influence and authority, complaints of grievances were
u&s;ually pre&s;ented to the hou&s;e, by any members who had had
particular opportunity of ob&s;erving them. The&s;e ge|neral
committees, which were a kind of inqui&s;itorial courts,
had not then been e&s;tabli&s;hed; and we find, that the King,
in a former declaration<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Publi&s;hed on di&s;&s;olving the third parliament. See Parl, Hi&s;t. vol. viii. p. 347.</NOTE>, complains loudly of this innova|tion,
&s;o little favourable to royal authority. But never was
&s;o much multiplied, as at pre&s;ent, the u&s;e of the&s;e com|mittees;
and the commons, tho' they them&s;elves were the
greate&s;t innovators, employed the u&s;ual artifice of complain|ing
again&s;t innovations, and pretending to recover the an|tient
and e&s;tabli&s;hed government.</P>
<P>FROM the reports of their committees, the hou&s;e daily
pa&s;&s;ed votes, which mortified and a&s;toni&s;hed the court, and
inflamed and animated the nation. Ship-money was de|clared
illegal and arbitrary; the &s;entence again&s;t Hambden
cancelled; the court of York aboli&s;hed; compo&s;itions of
knighthood &s;tigmatized; the enlargement of the fore&s;ts con|demned;
patents for monopolies annulled; and every late
mea&s;ure of the admini&s;tration treated with reproach and
obloquy. To-day, a &s;entence of the &s;tar-chamber was ex|claimed
again&s;t: To-morrow, a decree of the high-com|mi&s;&s;ion.
Every di&s;cretionary act of council was repre&s;ented
as arbitrary and tyrannical: And the general inference was
&s;till inculcated, that a formed de&s;ign had been laid to &s;ub|vert
the laws and con&s;titution of the kingdom.</P>
<P>FROM nece&s;&s;ity, the King remained intirely pa&s;&s;ive during
all the&s;e violent operations. The few &s;ervants, who con|tinued
faithful to him, were &s;eized with a&s;toni&s;hment at the
rapid progre&s;s made by the commons in power and popu|larity,
and were glad, by their inactive and inoffen&s;ive be|haviour,
<PB N="318" REF="366">
to compound for impunity. The torrent ri&s;ing
to &s;o dreadful and unexpected a height, de&s;pair &s;eized all
tho&s;e, who, from intere&s;t or habit, were mo&s;t attached to
monarchy. And as for tho&s;e, who maintained their duty to
the King, merely from their regard to the con&s;titution,
they &s;eemed, by their concurrence, to &s;well that inundation
which began already to deluge every thing. &startq;You have
taken the whole machine of government in pieces,&endq; &s;aid
Charles in a di&s;cour&s;e to the parliament; &startq;a practice fre|quent
with &s;kilful arti&s;ts, when they de&s;ire to clear the
wheels from any ru&s;t which may have grown upon them.
The engine,&endq; continued he, &startq;may again be re&s;tored to
its former u&s;e and motions, provided it be put up intire;
&s;o as not a pin of it be wanting.&endq; But this was far
from the intention of the commons. The machine, they
thought with fome rea&s;on, was encumbered with many
wheels and &s;prings, which retarded and cro&s;&s;ed its opera|tions,
and de&s;troyed its utility. Happy! had they pro|ceeded
with moderation, and been contented, in their pre|&s;ent
plenitude of power, to remove &s;uch parts only as might
ju&s;tly be deemed &s;uperfluous and incongruous.</P>
<P>IN order to maintain that high authority which they had
acquired, the commons, be&s;ides confounding and over|awing
their opponents, judged it requi&s;ite to in&s;pire cou|rage
into their friends and adherents; particularly into the
Scots, and the religious puritans, to who&s;e a&s;&s;i&s;tance and
good offices they were already &s;o much beholden.</P>
<P>No &s;ooner were die Scots ma&s;ters of the northern counties,
than they laid a&s;ide their fir&s;t profe&s;&s;ions, which they had
not indeed means to &s;upport, of paying for every thing;
and in order to prevent the de&s;tructive expedient of plunder
and free quarters, the country con&s;ented to give them a re|gular
contribution of 850 pounds a day, in full of their
&s;ub&s;i&s;tence<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Ru&s;h, vol. iii. p. 1295.</NOTE>. The parliament, that they might relieve the
<PB N="319" REF="367">
northern counties from &s;o grievous an oppre&s;&s;ion, agreed to
remit pay to the Scots, as well as to the Engli&s;h army; and
becau&s;e &s;ub&s;idies would be levied too &s;lowly for &s;o urgent an
occa&s;ion, money was borrowed from the citizens upon the
&s;ecurity of particular members. Two &s;ub&s;idies, a very
&s;mall &s;um<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">It appears, that a &s;ub&s;idy was now fallen to 50,000 pounds.</NOTE>, were at fir&s;t voted; and as the intention of
this &s;upply was to indemnify the members, who, by their
private, had &s;upported public credit, this pretence was im|mediately
laid hold of, and the money was ordered to be
paid, not into the trea&s;ury, but into commi&s;&s;ioners appointed
by parliament: A practice, which, as it dimini&s;hed the au|thority
of the crown, was very willingly embraced, and was
afterwards continued by the commons, with regard to every
branch of revenue which they granted the King. The in|va&s;ion
of the Scots had evidently been the cau&s;e of a&s;&s;em|bling
the parliament: The pre&s;ence of their army reduced
the King to that total &s;ubjection in which he was now held:
The commons, for this rea&s;on, very openly pro&s;e&s;&s;ed their
intention of retaining the&s;e invaders till all their enemies
&s;hould be &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, and all their purpo&s;es effected. <HI>We
cannot yet &s;pare the Scots,</HI> &s;aid Strode plainly in the hou&s;e;

Eighty thou&s;and pounds a month Were requi&s;ite for the &s;ub|&s;i&s;tence
of the two armies; a &s;um much greater than the
kingdom had ever been accu&s;tomed, in any former period,
to pay to the public. And tho' &s;everal &s;ub&s;idies, together
with a poll-tax, were from time to time voted to an&s;wer the
charge; the commons took care &s;till to be in debt, in order
to render the continuance of the &s;e&s;&s;ion the more nece&s;|&s;ary.</P>
<P>THE Scots being &s;uch u&s;eful allies to the malecontent
party in England, no wonder they were courted with the
<PB N="320" REF="368">
mo&s;t unlimited complai&s;ance and the mo&s;t important &s;ervices.
The $ing, in his fir&s;t &s;peech, having called them <HI>rebels,</HI>
ob&s;erved, that he had given great offence to the parliament;
and he was immediately obliged to &s;often, and even retract
that expre&s;&s;ion. The Scots commi&s;&s;ioners, of whom the
mo&s;t con&s;iderable were the Earl of Rothes and Lord Loudon,
found every advantage in conducting their treaty; and yet
made no ha&s;te in bringing it to an i&s;&s;ue. They were lodged
in the city, and kept an intimate corre&s;pondence, as well
with the magi&s;trates, who were extremely di&s;affected, as
with the popular leaders in both hou&s;es, St. Antholine's
church was a&s;&s;igned them for their devotions; and their
chaplains, here, began openly to practi&s;e the pre&s;byterian
form of wor&s;hip, which, except in foreign languages, had
never hitherto been allowed any indulgence or toleration.
So violent was the general propen&s;ity towards this new reli|gion,
that multitudes of all ranks crowded into the church.
Tho&s;e, who were &s;o happy as to find acce&s;s early in the
morning, kept their places the whole day: Tho&s;e, who
were excluded, clung to the doors or windows in hopes of
catching, at lea&s;t, &s;ome di&s;tant murmurs or broken phra&s;es
of the holy rhetoric<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Clarendon, vol. i. p. 189.</NOTE>. All the eloquence of parliament,
now well refined from pedantry, animated, with the &s;pirit of
liberty, and employed in &s;uch important intere&s;ts, was not
attended to with &s;uch in&s;atiable avidity, as were the&s;e lec|tures,
delivered with ridiculous cant, and a provincial ac|cent,
full of barbari&s;m and of ignorance.</P>
<P>THE mo&s;t effectual expedient for paying court to the
zealous Scots was to promote the pre&s;byterian di&s;cipline and
wor&s;hip throughout England; and to this innovation, the
popular leaders among the commons, as well as their mo&s;t
devoted partizans, were, of them&s;elves, &s;ufficiently inclined.
The puritanical party, who&s;e progre&s;s, though &s;ecret, had
hitherto been gradual in the kingdom, taking advantage of
<PB N="321" REF="369">
the pre&s;ent di&s;orders,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The bi&s;hops attacked.</NOTE> began openly to pro&s;e&s;s their tenets,
and to make &s;urious attacks on the e&s;tabli&s;hed religion. The
prevalence of that &s;ect in the parliament di&s;covered it&s;elf,
from the beginning, by infen&s;ible, but deci&s;ive &s;ymptoms.
Mar&s;hall and Burge&s;s, two puritanical clergymen, were
cho&s;en to preach before them, and entertained them with
di&s;cour&s;es &s;even hours in length<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Nal&s;on, vol. i. p. 530, 533.</NOTE>. It being the cu&s;tom of
the hou&s;e always to take the &s;acrament before they entered
upon bu&s;ine&s;s, they ordered, as a nece&s;&s;ary preliminary,
that the communion table &s;hould be removed from the ea&s;t
end of St. Margaret's into the middle of the area<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Idem ibid. p. 537.</NOTE>. The
name of the <HI>&s;piritual lords</HI> was commonly left out in acts
of parliament; and the laws ran in name of the king,
lords, and commons. The clerk of the upper hou&s;e, in
reading bills, turned his back on the bench of bi&s;hops;
nor was his in&s;olence ever taken notice of. On a day ap|pointed
for a &s;olemn fa&s;t and humiliation, all the orders of
temporal peers, contrary to former practice, in going to
church, took place of the &s;piritual; and the Lord Spencer
remarked, that the humiliation, that day, &s;eemed confined
alone to the prelates.</P>
<P>EVERY meeting of the commons produced &s;ome Vehe|ment
harangue again&s;t the u&s;urpations of the bi&s;hops, again&s;t
the high-commi&s;&s;ion, again&s;t the late convocation, again&s;t
the new canons. So di&s;gu&s;ted were all lovers of civil liberty
at the doctrines promoted by the clergy, that the&s;e invectives
were received without controul; and no di&s;tinction, at fir&s;t,
appeared between &s;uch as de&s;ired only to repre&s;s the exor|bitances
of the hierarchy, and &s;uch as pretended totally to
annihilate epi&s;copal juri&s;diction. Encouraged by the&s;e fa|vourable
appearances, petitions again&s;t the church were
framed in different parts of the kingdom. The epithet of
the ignorant and vicious prie&s;thood was commonly applied
<PB N="322" REF="370">
to all churchmen, addicted to the e&s;tabli&s;hed di&s;cipline and
wor&s;hip; though the epi&s;copal clergy in England, during
that age, &s;eem to have been, as they are at pre&s;ent, &s;uffi|ciently
learned and exemplary. An addre&s;s again&s;t epi&s;co|pacy
was pre&s;ented by twelve clergymen to the committee of
religion, and pretended to be &s;igned by many hundreds of
the puritanical per&s;ua&s;ion. But what made mo&s;t noi&s;e was
the city petition for a total alteration of church govern|ment;
a petition, to which 15,000 &s;ub&s;criptions were an|nexed,
and which was pre&s;ented by Alderman Pennington,
the city-member<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Clarendon, vol. i. p. 203. Whitlocke, p. 37. Nal&s;on, vol. i. p. 666.</NOTE>. 'Tis remarkable, that, among the
many eccle&s;ia&s;tical abu&s;es there complained of, an allowance

<P>NOTWITHSTANDING the favourable di&s;po&s;ition of the
people, the leaders in the hou&s;e re&s;olved to proceed with
caution. They introduced a bill for prohibiting all clergy|men
the exerci&s;e of any civil office. As a con&s;equence, the
bi&s;hops were to be deprived of their &s;eats in the hou&s;e of
peers; a mea&s;ure not unacceptable to the zealous friends of
liberty, who ob&s;erved, with regret, the devoted attachment
of that order to the will of the monarch. But when this
bill was pre&s;ented to the peers, it was rejected by a; great
majority<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Clarendon, vol. i. p. 237.</NOTE>. The fir&s;t check which the commons had re|ceived
in their popular career, and a progno&s;tic of what
they might afterwards expect from the upper hou&s;e, who&s;e
inclinations and intere&s;t could never be totally &s;eparated from
the throne. But to &s;how how little they were di&s;couraged,
the puritans immediately brought in another bill for the total
abolition of epi&s;copacy; tho' they thought proper to let
that bill &s;leep at pre&s;ent, in expectation of a more favour|able
opportunity for reviving it<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Idem ibid. p. 237.</NOTE>.</P>

AMONG other acts of regal, executive power, which the
commons were every day a&s;&s;uming; they i&s;&s;ued orders for
the demoli&s;hing all images, altars crucifixes. The zealous
Sir Robert Harley, to whom the execution of the&s;e orders
was committed, removed all cro&s;&s;es even out &s;treets and

&s;o indu&s;trious in reducing the laity to &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, were ex|tremely

<P>A COMMITTEE was erected by the commons as a court
of inqui&s;ition upon the clergy, and was commonly denomi|nated
the committee of <HI>&s;candalous ministers.</HI> The politi|cians
among the commons were apprized of the great im|portance
of the pulpit for guiding the people; the bigots
<PB N="324" REF="372">
were enraged again&s;t the prelatical cl$rgy; and both of
than knew, that no e&s;tabli&s;hed government could be over|thrown
by ob&s;erving &s;trictly the principles of ju&s;tice; equity,
or clemency. The proceedings, therefore, of this famous
committee, which continued for &s;everal years, were, to the
la&s;t degree, cruel and arbitrary, and made dreadful havock
both on the church and the univer&s;ities. They began with
hara&s;&s;ing, impri&s;oning, and mole&s;ting the clergy; and ended
with &s;eque&s;tring and ejecting them. In order to join con|tumely
to cruelty, they gave the &s;ufferers the epithet of
<HI>&s;candalous,</HI> and endeavoured to render them as odious as
they were mi&s;erable<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Clarendon, vol. i. p. 199. Whitlocke, p. 122. May, p. 81.</NOTE>. The utmo&s;t vices, however, which
they could reproach to a great part of them, were, bowing
at the name of Je&s;us, placing the communion-table in the
ea&s;t, reading the King's orders for forts on Sunday, and
other practices, which the e&s;tabli&s;hed government, both in
church and &s;tate, had &s;trictly enjoined them.</P>
<P>IT may be worth ob&s;erving, that all the hi&s;torians, who
lived near that age, or what perhaps is more deci&s;ive, all
authors, who have ca&s;ually made mention of tho&s;e public
tran&s;actions, &s;till repre&s;ent the civil di&s;orders and convul&s;ions
as proceeding from religious controver&s;y, and con&s;ider the
political di&s;putes about power and liberty as intirely &s;ubor|dinate
to the other. 'Tis true, had the King been able to
ab&s;tain from all inva&s;ion of national privileges, it is not pro|bable
that the puritans ever could have acquired &s;uch au|thority
as to overturn the whole con&s;titution: Yet &s;o intire
was the &s;ubjection into which Charles was now fallen, that,
if the wound had not been poi&s;oned by the infu&s;ion of
theological hatred, it mu&s;t have admitted of a very ea&s;y
remedy. Di&s;u&s;e of parliaments, impri&s;onment and prosecu|tion
of members, &s;hip-money, an arbitrary and illegal ad|mini&s;tration;
the&s;e were loudly complained of: But the
<PB N="325" REF="373">
grievances, which tended chiefly to inflame the parliament
and nation, e&s;pecially the latter, were, the &s;urplice, the
rails placed about the altar, the bows exacted on approach|ing
it, the liturgy, the breach of the &s;abbath, embroidered
copes, lawn &s;leeves, the u&s;e of the ring in marriage, and
of the cro&s;s in bapti&s;m. On account of the&s;e, were both
parties contented to throw the government into &s;uch violent
convul&s;ions; and to the di&s;grace of that age and of this
i&s;land, it mu&s;t be acknowleged, that the di&s;orders in Scot|land
intirely, and tho&s;e in England mo&s;tly, proceeded from

of both are in&s;pected! Compare only one circum&s;tance,

<P>THE Queen Mother of France, having been forced into

by the populace on account of her religion; and was
even threatened with wor&s;e treatment. The Earl of Hol|land,
Lord lieutenant of Middle&s;ex, had ordered a hundred
mu&s;queteers to guard her; but finding that they had im|bibed
the &s;ame prejudices with the re&s;t of their country|men,

indignity of the action, that &s;o great a Prince&s;s, mother
to the King of France, and to the Queens of Spain and

ob&s;erved the indelible reproach which would fall upon the
nation, if that unfortunate Queen &s;hould &s;uffer any violence
from the mi&s;guided zeal of the people. He urged the &s;acred

<P>CHARLES, in the former part of his reign, had endea|voured
to overcome the intractable and incroaching &s;pirit
of the commons, by a per&s;everance in his own mea&s;ures, by
a &s;tately dignity of behaviour, and by maintaining, at their
utmo&s;t height, and even &s;tretching beyond former precedent,
the rights of his prerogative. Finding by experience how
un&s;ucce&s;sful tho&s;e mea&s;ures had proved, and ob&s;erving the
low condition to which he was now reduced, he re&s;olved to
alter his whole conduct, and to regain the confidence of his
people, by pliablene&s;s, by conce&s;&s;ions, and by a total con|formity
to their inclinations and prejudices. He did not
con&s;ider, that the true rule of government, in &s;o difficult
a &s;ituation, as that, in which, from the beginning of his
reign, he was placed, con&s;i&s;ted neither in &s;teddine&s;s nor fa|cility,
but in &s;uch a judicious mixture of both, as would
exactly &s;uit the pre&s;ent circum&s;tances of the nation, and the
particular preten&s;ions of his opponents. And it may &s;afely
be averred, that this new extreme, into which'the King,
for want of proper coun&s;el or &s;upport, was fallen, became
equally dangerous to the con&s;titution, and pernicious to
<PB N="329" REF="377">
public peace,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tonnage and poundage.</NOTE> as the other in which he had &s;o long and &s;o
unfortunattely per&s;erved.</P>
<P>THE preten&s;ions with regard to tonnage and poundage
were revived, and with certain a&s;&s;urance of &s;ucce&s;s, by the
commons<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">It appears not, that the commons, tho' now intirely ma&s;ters, aboli&s;hed the new impo&s;itions of James, again&s;t which they had formerly &s;o loudly complained: A certain proof that the rates of cu&s;toms, &s;ettled by that Prince, were in mo&s;t in&s;tances ju&s;t, and proportioned to the new price of commodities. They &s;eem rather to have, been low: For they rai&s;ed only die cu&s;toms a third; whereas prices had certainly augmented five or &s;ix times. See journ. 10 Aug. 1625.</NOTE>. The levying the&s;e duties, as formerly, with|out
con&s;ent of parliament, and even increa&s;ing them at plea|&s;ure,
was &s;uch an incongruity in a free con&s;titution, where
the people, by their fundamental privileges, cannot be
taxed but by their own con&s;ent, as could no longer be en|dured
by the&s;e jealous patrons of liberty. In the preamble,
therefore, to the bill by which the commons granted the&s;e
duties to the King, they took care, in the &s;tronge&s;t and
mo&s;t po&s;itive terms, to a&s;&s;ert their own right of be&s;towing
this gift, and to dive&s;t the crown of all independent title of
a&s;&s;uming it. And that they might increa&s;e, or rather, finally
fix, the intire dependence and &s;ubjection of the King, they
voted the&s;e duties only for two months; and afterwards
from time to time, renewed their grant for very &s;hort pe|riods<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">It Was an in&s;truction given by the hou&s;e to the committee which framed one of the&s;e bills, to take care that the rates upon the home-commodities may be as light as po&s;&s;ible; and upon fo|reign commodities as heavy as trade will bear: A proof, that the nature of commerce began now to be under&s;tood.

Charles, in order to &s;how that he entertained no
intention ever again to &s;eparate him&s;elf from his parlia|ment,
pa&s;&s;ed this important bill, without any &s;cruple or
he&s;itation<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Cla|$ndon, vol. i. p. 208.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>WITH regard to the bill for triennial parliaments,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Triennial bill.</NOTE>
he made a little difficulty. By an old &s;tatute, pa&s;&s;ed during
the reign of Edward III. it had been enacted, that parlia|ments
&s;hould be held once every year, or more frequently,
<PB N="330" REF="378">
if nece&s;&s;ary: But as no provi&s;ion had been made in cafe
of failure, and no preci&s;e method pointed out for execu|tion;
this &s;tatute had been con&s;idered merely as a general
declaration, and was di&s;pen&s;ed with at plea&s;ure. The defect
was &s;upplied by tho&s;e vigilant patriots, who now a&s;&s;umed
the reins of government. It was enacted, that if the chan|cellor,
who was fir&s;t bound under &s;evere penalties, failed
to i&s;&s;ue writs by the third of September in every third year,
any twelve or more of the peers &s;hould be impowered to
exert this authority: In default of the peers, the-&s;heriffs,
mayors, bailiffs, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> &s;hould &s;ummon the voters: And in
their default, the voters them&s;elves &s;hould meet and proceed
to the election of members, in the &s;ame manner as if writs
had been regularly i&s;&s;ued from the crown. Nor could the
parliament, after it was a&s;&s;embled, be adjourned, prorogued,
or di&s;&s;olved, without their own con&s;ent, during the &s;pace of
fifty days. By this bill, &s;ome of the noble&s;t and mo&s;t va|luable
prerogatives of the crown were retrenched; but at
the &s;ame time, nothing could be more nece&s;&s;ary than &s;uch
a &s;tatute, for completing a regular plan of law and liberty.
A great reluctance to a&s;&s;emble parliaments mu&s;t be expected
in the King; where the&s;e a&s;&s;emblies, as of late, e&s;tabli&s;h
it as a maxim to carry their &s;crutiny into every part of go|vernment.
During long intermi&s;&s;ions of parliament, griev|ances
and abu&s;es, as was found by recent experience, would
naturally creep in; and it would even become nece&s;&s;ary for
the King and council to exert a great di&s;cretionary autho|rity,
and, by acts of &s;tate, to &s;upply, in every emergence,
the legi&s;lative power, who&s;e meeting was &s;o uncertain and
precarious. Charles, finding that nothing le&s;s would &s;atisfy
his parliament and people, at la&s;t gave his a&s;&s;ent to this
bill, which produced &s;o great an innovation in the con&s;titu|tion<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Clarendon, vol. i. p. 209. Whitlecke, p. 39. Ru&s;hworth, vol. v. p. 189.</NOTE>. Solemn thanks were pre&s;ented him by both hou&s;es.
Great rejoicings were expre&s;&s;ed both in the city and through|out
<PB N="331" REF="379">
the nation. And mighty profe&s;&s;ions were every-where
made of gratitude and mutual returns of &s;upply and con|fidence.
This conce&s;&s;ion of the King, it mu&s;t be owned,
was not intirely voluntary: It was of a nature too import|ant
to be voluntary. The &s;ole inference, which his parti|zans
were intitled to draw from the &s;ubmi&s;&s;ions &s;o frankly
made to pre&s;ent nece&s;&s;ity, was, that he had certainly adopted
a new plan of government, and, for the future, was re|&s;olved,
by every indulgence, to acquire the confidence and
affections of his people.</P>
<P>CHARLES thought, that what conce&s;&s;ions were made to
the public were of little con&s;equence, if no gratifications
were be&s;towed on the individuals, who had acquired the
direction of public coun&s;els and determinations. A change
of mini&s;ters, as well as of mea&s;ures, was therefore re&s;olved
on. In one day &s;everal new privy-coun&s;ellors were &s;worn;
the Earls of Hertford, Bedford, E&s;&s;ex, Bri&s;tol; the Lords
Say, Saville, Kimbolton: Within a few days after, was
admitted the Earl of Warwick<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Clarendon, vol. i. p. 195.</NOTE>. All the&s;e noblemen were
of the popular party; and &s;ome of them afterwards, when
matters were pu&s;hed to extremity by the commons, proved
the greate&s;t &s;upport of monarchy.</P>
<P>JUXON, bi&s;hop of London, who had never de&s;ired the
trea&s;urer's &s;taff, now earne&s;tly &s;olicited for leave
to re&s;ign it, and retire to the care of that turbulent dioce&s;e which
was committed to him. The King gave his a&s;&s;ent; and it
is remarkable, that, during all the &s;evere inquiries carried
on again&s;t the conduct of mini&s;ters and prelates, the mild
and prudent virtues of this man, who bore both the&s;e in|vidious
characters, remained unmole&s;ted<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Warwick, p. 95.</NOTE>. It was intended,
that Bedford, a popular man, of great authority, as well
as wi&s;dom and moderation, &s;hould &s;ucceed Juxon: But
that nobleman, very unfortunately both for King and people,
<PB N="332" REF="380">
died about this very time.. By &s;ome promotions, place was
made for St. John, who was created folicitor-general. Hollis
was to be made &s;ecretary of &s;tate, in place of Windebank,
who had fled: Pym, chancellor of the exchequer, in
place of Lord Cottington, who had re&s;igned: Lord Say,
ma&s;ter of the wards, in place of the &s;ame nobleman: The
Earl of E&s;&s;ex, governor; and Hambden, tutor to the
Prince.</P>
<P>WHAT retarded the execution of the&s;e projected changes,
was the difficulty of &s;atisfying all tho&s;e, who, from their
activity and authority in parliament, had preten&s;ions for
offices, and who had it &s;till in their power to embarra&s;s and
di&s;tre&s;s the public mea&s;ures. Their a&s;&s;ociates too in popu|larity,
whom the King intended to di&s;tingui&s;h by his favours,
were unwilling to undergo the reproach of having driven a
&s;eparate bargain, and of &s;acrificing, to their own ambitious
views, the cau&s;e of the nation. And as they were &s;en&s;ible
that they mu&s;t owe their preferment intirely to their weight
and con&s;ideration in parliament, they were mo&s;t of them re|&s;olved
&s;till to adhere to that a&s;&s;embly, and both to promote
its authority, and to pre&s;erve their own credit in it. On all
occa&s;ions, they had no other advice to give the King, than
to allow him&s;elf to be directed by his great council; or, in
other words, to re&s;ign him&s;elf pa&s;&s;ively to their guidance
and government. And Charles found, that, in&s;tead of ac|quiring
friends by the honours and offices which he &s;hould
be&s;tow, he &s;hould only arm his enemies with more power to
hurt him.</P>
<P>THE end, on which the King was mo&s;t intent in change|ing
mini&s;ters, was, to &s;ave the life of the Earl of Stra&s;&s;ord,
and to mollify, by the&s;e indulgences, the rage of his mo&s;t
furious pro&s;ecutors. But &s;o high was that nobleman's re|putation
for experience and capacity, that all the new coun|&s;ellors
and intended mini&s;ters plainly &s;aw that if he e&s;caped
<NOTE PLACE="foot">w Clarendon, vol. i. p. 210, 211.</NOTE>
<PB N="333" REF="381">
their vengeance, he mu&s;t return into favour and authority;
and they regarded his death as the only &s;ecurity which they
could have, both for the e&s;tabli&s;hment of their pre&s;ent
power, and for &s;ucce&s;s in their farther enterprizes. His
impeachment, therefore, was pu&s;hed on with the utmo&s;t
vigour;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Strafford's trial.</NOTE> and, after long and &s;olemn preparations, was brought
to a final i&s;&s;ue.</P>
<P>IMMEDIATELY after Strafford was &s;eque&s;tred from par|liament,
and con&s;ined in the Tower, a committee of thir|teen
were cho&s;en by the lower hou&s;e, and entru&s;ted with
the office of preparing a charge agin&s;t him. The&s;e, joined
to a &s;mall committee of lords, were ve&s;ted with authority
to examine all witne&s;&s;es, to call for every paper, and to u&s;e
any means of &s;crutiny, with regard to any part of the Earl's
behaviour and conduct<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Clarendon, vol. i. p. 192.</NOTE>. After &s;o general and unbounded
an inqui&s;ition, exerci&s;ed by &s;uch powerful and implacable
enemies; a man mu&s;t have been very cautions or very inno|cent,
not to afford, during the whole cour&s;e of his life,
&s;ome matter of accu&s;ation again&s;t him.</P>
<P>THIS committee, by direction from both hou&s;es, took an
oath of &s;ecrecy; a practice very unu&s;ual, and which gave
them the appearance of con&s;pirators, more than mini&s;ters of
ju&s;tice<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Whitlocke, p. 37.</NOTE>. But the intention of this &s;trictne&s;s, was to render
it more difficult for the Earl to elude their &s;earch, or pre|pare

<P>APPLICATION was made to the King, that he would
allow this committee to examine privy-coun&s;ellors with re|gard
to opinions delivered at the board. A conce&s;&s;ion which
charles unawrily made, and which thenceforth bani&s;hed all
mutual confidence from the deliberations of council; where

SIR George Rat$liffe, the Earl's intimate friend and
confident, was accu&s;ed of high trea&s;on, &s;ent for from Ire|land,
and committed to clo&s;e cu&s;tody. As no charge
ever appeared or was pro&s;ecuted again&s;t him, it is im|po&s;&s;ible
to give a more charitable interpretation to this
mea&s;ure, than that the commons thereby intended to de|prive
Strafford, in his pre&s;ent di&s;tre&s;s, of the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of
his be&s;t friend, who was mo&s;t enabled, by his te&s;timony,
to ju&s;tify the innocence of his patron's conduct and beha|viour<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Clarendon, vol. i. p. 214.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>WHEN intelligence arrived in Ireland of the plans laid for
Strafford's ruin, the Iri&s;h hou&s;e of commons, tho' they had
very lately be&s;towed mo&s;t ample prai&s;es on his admini&s;tration,
entered into all the violent coun&s;els again&s;t him, and prepared
a repre&s;entation of the mi&s;erable &s;tate, into which, by his
mi&s;conduct, they &s;uppo&s;ed the kingdom to be fallen. They
&s;ent over a committee into England, to a&s;&s;i&s;t in the pro&s;ecution
of their unfortunate governor; and by intimations from this
committee, who entered into clo&s;e confederacy with the po|pular
leaders in England, was every mea&s;ure of the Iri&s;h
parliament governed and directed. Impeachments, which
were never pro&s;ecuted, were carried up again&s;t Sir Richard
Bolton the chancellor, Sir Gerard Louther chief ju&s;tice,
and Bramhall bi&s;hop of Derry<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Ru&s;h. vol. v. p. 214.</NOTE>. This &s;tep, which was an
exact counterpart to the proceedings in England, &s;erved al&s;o
the &s;ame purpo&s;es: It deprived the King of the mini&s;ters
whom he mo&s;t tru&s;ted; it di&s;couraged and terrified all the
other mini&s;ters; and it prevented tho&s;e per&s;ons, who were
be&s;t acquainted with Strafford's coun&s;els, from giving evi|dence
in his favour before the Engli&s;h parliament.</P>
<P>THE bi&s;hops,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1641.</NOTE> being forbid by the antient canons to a&s;&s;i&s;t
in any trial for life, and being unwilling, by any oppo&s;ition,
to irritate the commons, who were already much prejudiced
<PB N="335" REF="383">
again&s;t them, thought proper, of them&s;elves, to Withdraw<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Clarendon, vol. i. p. 216.</NOTE>.
The commons al&s;o voted, that the new-created peers ought
to have no voice in this trial; becau&s;e the accu&s;ation being
agreed to, while they were commoners, their con&s;ent to it
was implied with that of all the commons of England.
Notwith&s;tanding this deci&s;ion, which was meant only to de|prive
Strafford of &s;o many friends, the Lord Seymour, and
&s;ome others, &s;till continued to keep their &s;eat; nor was their
right to it any farther que&s;tioned<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Idem ibid.</NOTE></P>
<P>To be&s;tow a greater &s;olemnity on this important trial,
&s;caffolds were erected in We&s;min&s;ter-hall; where both
hou&s;es &s;at, the one as accu&s;ers, the other as judges. Be|&s;ides
the chair of &s;tate, a clo&s;e gallery was prepared for the
King and Queen, who attended during the whole trial<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Whitlocke, p. 40. Ru&s;h, vol. iv. p. 41. May, 90.</NOTE></P>
<P>AN accu&s;ation, carried on by the united effort of three
kingdoms, again&s;t one man, unproteced by power, una&s;|&s;i&s;ted
y council, di&s;countenanced by authority, was likely
to prove a very unequal conte&s;t: Yet &s;uch was the capacity,
genius, pre&s;ence of mind, di&s;played, by this magnanimous
&s;tate&s;man, that, while argument and rea&s;on and law had any
place, he obtained an undi&s;puted victory. And, he peri&s;hed
at la&s;t, overwhelmed and &s;till un&s;ubdued, by the open vio|lence
of his fierce and unrelenting antagoni&s;ts.</P>
<P>THE articles of impeachment again&s;t Strafford are twenty|eight
in number; and regard his conduct,<NOTE PLACE="marg">March 22</NOTE> as pre&s;ident of
the council of York, as deputy or lieutenant Ireland, as
coun&s;ellor or commander in England. But tho' four months
were employed by the managers in framing the accu&s;ation,
and all Strafford's an&s;wers were extemporary; it appears
from compari&s;on, not only that he was free from the crime
of trea&s;on, of which there is not the lea&s;t appearance, but
that his conduct, making allowance for human infirmities,
<PB N="336" REF="384">
expo&s;ed to &s;uch &s;evere &s;crutiny, was innocent, and even
laudable.</P>
<P>THE powers of the northern council, while he was pre|&s;ident,
had been extended, by the King's in&s;tructions, be|yond
what formerly had been practi&s;ed: But that court be|ing,
at fir&s;t, in&s;tituted by a &s;tretch of royal prerogative, it
had been u&s;ual for the prince to vary his in&s;tructions; and
the large&s;t authority, committed to it, was altogether as,
legal as the mo&s;t moderate and mo&s;t limited. Nor was it
rea&s;onable to conclude, that Strafford had u&s;ed any art to
procure tho&s;e exten&s;ive powers; &s;ince he never once &s;at as
pre&s;ident, nor exerci&s;ed one act of juri&s;diction, after he
was inve&s;ted with the authority &s;o much complained of<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Ru&s;hworth, vol. iv. p. 145.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IN the government of Ireland, his admini&s;tration had
been equally promotive of his ma&s;ter's intere&s;t, and that of
the &s;ubjects committed to his care. A large debt he had
paid off: He had left a con&s;iderable &s;um in the exchequer:
The revenues, which before never an&s;wered the charges of
government, were now rai&s;ed to be equal to them<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Idem ibid. p. 120, 247. War|wick, p. 115.</NOTE>. A
&s;mall &s;tanding army, formerly kept in no order, was aug|mented,
and was governed by the mo&s;t exact di&s;cipline:
And a great force was there rai&s;ed and paid, for the &s;upport
of the King's authority again&s;t the Scots covenanters.</P>
<P>INDUSTRY, and all the arts of peace, were intro|duced
among that &s;avage people: The &s;hipping of the
kingdom augmented a hundred fold<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Nal&s;on, vol. ii. p. 45.</NOTE>: The cu&s;toms tri|pled
upon the &s;ame rates<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Ru&s;h. vol. iv. p. 124.</NOTE>: The exports double in value
to the imports: Manufactures, particularly that of linen,
introduced and promoted<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Warwick, p. 115.</NOTE>. Agriculture, by means of the
Engli&s;h and Scots plantations, gradually advancing: The
<PB N="337" REF="385">
prote&s;tant religion encouraged, without the per&s;ecution
or di&s;content of the catholics.</P>
<P>THE &s;prings of authority he had enforced without over|&s;training
them. Di&s;cretionary acts of juri&s;diction, indeed,
he had often exerted, by holding courts-martial, billetting
&s;oldiers, deciding cau&s;es upon paper-petitions before the
council, i&s;&s;uing proclamations; and puni&s;hing their infrac|tion.
But di&s;cretionary authority, during that age, was
u&s;ually exerci&s;ed even in England. In Ireland, it was &s;till
more requi&s;ite, among a wild people, not yet thoroughly
&s;ubdued, aver&s;e to the religion and manners of their con|querors,
ready on all occa&s;ions to relap&s;e into rebellion and
di&s;order. While the managers of the commons demanded,
every moment, that the deputy's conduct &s;hould be exa|mined
by the line of rigid law and &s;evere principles; he
appealed &s;till to the practice of all former deputies, and to
the uncontroulable nece&s;&s;ity of his &s;ituation.</P>
<P>So great was his art of managing elections, and balancing
parties, that he had engaged the Iri&s;h parliament to vote
whatever was nece&s;&s;ary, both for the payment of former
debts, and for &s;upport of the new-levied army; nor had he
ever been reduced to the illegal expedients practi&s;ed in Eng|land,
for the &s;upply of public nece&s;&s;ities. No imputation
of rapacity could ju&s;tly lie again&s;t his admini&s;tration. Some
in&s;tances of imperious expre&s;&s;ions and even actions may be
met with. The ca&s;e of Lord Mountnorris, of all tho&s;e
collected with &s;o much indu&s;try, is the mo&s;t &s;lagrant and
the lea&s;t excu&s;able.</P>
<P>IT had been reported at the table of the Lord chancel|lor
Loftus, that one of the deputy's attendants, a relation
of Mountnorris, in moving a &s;tool, had &s;orely hurt his
ma&s;ter's foot, who was at that time afflicted with the gout.
<HI>Perhaps,</HI> &s;aid Mountnorris, who was pre&s;ent at table, <HI>it
was done in revenge of that public affront which my Lord
deputy formerly put upon me:</HI> BUT I HAVE A BROTHER,
<PB N="338" REF="386">
WHO WOULD NOT HAVE TAKEN SUCH A REVENGE.
This ca&s;ual, and &s;eemingly innocent, at lea&s;t very ambi|guous,
expre&s;&s;ion, was reported to Stra&s;&s;ord; who, on
pretence that Mountnorris was an officer, ordered him to be
tried by a court-martial for mutiny and &s;edition again&s;t his
general. The court, which con&s;i&s;ted of the chief officers
of the army, found the crime to be capital, and condemned
that nobleman to lo&s;e his head<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Ru&s;h, vol. iv. p. 187.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IN vain did Strafford plead in his own defence again&s;t
this article of impeachment, That the &s;entence again&s;t
Mountnorris was the deed, and that too unanimous, of the
court, not the act of the deputy; that he &s;poke not to a
member of the court, nor voted in the cau&s;e, but &s;at un|covered
as a party; and then immediately withdrew, to leave them to
their freedom; that &s;en&s;ible of the iniquity
of the &s;entence, he procured his Maje&s;ty's free pardon to
Mountnorris; that he did not even keep that nobleman a
moment in &s;u&s;pence with regard to his &s;ate, but in&s;tantly
told him, that he him&s;elf would &s;ooner lo&s;e his right hand
than execute &s;uch a &s;entence, nor was his lord&s;hip's life
in any manner of danger; and that, upon the whole, the only
hard&s;hip which Mountnorris &s;uffered, was impri&s;onment
during two days, after which his liberty was re&s;tored him.
In vain did Strafford's friends add, as a further apology,
that Mountnorris was a man of an infamous character, who
paid court, by the lowe&s;t adulation, to all deputies, while
pre&s;ent; and blackened their character, by the vile&s;t ca|lumnies,
when recalled: And that Strafford, expecting like
treatment, had u&s;ed this expedient for no other purpo&s;e
than to &s;ubdue the petulant &s;pirit of the man. The&s;e ex|cu&s;es
alleviate the guilt; but there &s;till remains enough to
prove, that the mind of the deputy, tho' great and firm,
had been not a little debauched by the riot of ab&s;olute
power, and uncontrouled authority.</P>
<P><PB N="339" REF="387">
WHEN Strafford was called over into England, he found
every thing falling into &s;uch confu&s;ion, by the open rebel|lion
of the Scots, and the &s;ecret di&s;contents of the Engli&s;h,
that, if he had coun&s;elled or executed any violent mea&s;ure,
he might perhaps have been able to apologize for his con|duct,
from the great law of nece&s;&s;ity, which admits not,
while the nece&s;&s;ity is extreme, of any &s;cruple, ceremony,
or delay<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Ru&s;hworth, vol. iv. p. 559.</NOTE>. But in fact, no illegal advice or action was
proved again&s;t him; and the whole amount of his guilt,
during this period, was &s;ome peevi&s;h, or at mo&s;t imperious
expre&s;&s;ions, which, amid&s;t &s;uch de&s;perate extremities, and
during a bad &s;tate of health, had unhappily fallen from
him.</P>
<P>IF Strafford's apology was, in the main, &s;o &s;atisfactory,
when he pleaded to each particular article of the charge, his
victory was &s;till more deci&s;ive, when he brought the whole
together, and repelled the imputation of trea&s;on; the crime
which the commons would infer from the full view of his
conduct and behaviour. Of all &s;pecies of guilt, the law of
England had, with the mo&s;t &s;crupulous exactn$&s;s, defined
that of trea&s;on; becau&s;e on that &s;ide it was found mo&s;t
nece&s;&s;ary to protect the &s;ubject again&s;t the violence of the
king and of his mini&s;ters. By the famous &s;tatute of Ed|ward
III. all the kinds of trea&s;on are enumerated, and every
other crime, be&s;ides &s;uch as are there expre&s;sly mentioned,
is carefully excluded from that denomination. But with
regard to this guilt, <HI>An endeavour to &s;ubvert the funda|mental
laws,</HI> the &s;tatute of trea&s;on is totally &s;ilent: And
arbitrarily to introduce it into the fatal catalogue, is it&s;elf a
&s;ubver&s;ion of all law; and, under colour of de&s;ending
liberty, rever&s;es a &s;tatute the be&s;t calculated for the &s;ecurity
of liberty, which had ever been enacted by an Engli&s;h par|liament.</P>
<P><PB N="340" REF="388">
As this &s;pecies of trea&s;on, di&s;covered by the commons,
is intirely new and unknown to the laws; &s;o is the &s;pecies
of proof by which they pretend to fix that guilt upon the
pri&s;oner. They have invented a kind of <HI>accumulative</HI> or
<HI>con&s;tructive</HI> evidence, by which many actions, either totally
innocent in them&s;elves, or criminal in a much inferior de|gree,
&s;hall, when united, amount to trea&s;on, and &s;ubject
the per&s;on to the highe&s;t penalties inflicted by the law. A
ha&s;ty and unguarded word, a ra&s;h and pa&s;&s;ionate action,
a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the malevolent fancy of the accu&s;er, and tortured
by doubtful con&s;tructions, is tran&s;muted into the deepe&s;t
guilt; and the lives and fortunes of the whole nation, no
longer protected by ju&s;tice, are &s;ubjected to arbitrary will
and plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>&startq;WHERE has this &s;pecies of guilt lain &s;o long con|cealed?&endq;
&s;aid Strafford in conclu&s;ion: &startq;Where has this
fire been &s;o long buried, during &s;o many centuries, that
no &s;moke &s;hould appear, till it bur&s;t out at once, to con|&s;ume
me and my children? Better it were to live under
no law at all, and by the maxims of cautious prudence,
to conform our&s;elves, the be&s;t we can, to the arbitrary will
of a ma&s;ter; than fan&s;y we have a law on which we can
rely, and find at la&s;t, that this law &s;hall inflict a puni&s;h|ment
precedent to the promulgation, and try us by
maxims unheard-of, till the very moment of the pro&s;e|cution.

<PB N="343" REF="391">
chairman of that committee which conducted the impeach|ment
again&s;t this unfortunate &s;tate&s;man. The accu&s;ation
and defence la&s;ted eighteen days. The managers divided
the &s;everal articles among them, and attacked the pri&s;oner
with all the weight of authority, with all the vehemence of
rhetoric, with all the accuracy of long preparation. Straf|ford
was obliged to &s;peak with deference and re&s;erve towards
his mo&s;t inveterate enemies, the commons, the Scots nation,
the Iri&s;h parliament. He took only a very &s;hort time, on
each article, to recollect him&s;elf: Yet he alone, without a&s;|&s;i&s;tance,
mixing mode&s;ty and humility with firmne&s;s and
vigour, made &s;uch a defence, that the commons &s;aw it im|po&s;&s;ible,
by a legal pro&s;ecution, ever to obtain a &s;entence
again&s;t him.</P>
<P>BUT the death of Strafford was too important a &s;troke
of party to be left unattempted by any expedient, however
extraordinary. Be&s;ides the great genius and authority of
that mini&s;ter, he had threatened &s;ome of the popular leaders
with an impeachment; and, had he not been &s;uddenly pre|vented
by an accu&s;ation of the commons, he had, that very
day, it was thought, charged Pym, Hambden, and others,
with trea&s;on, for having invited the Scots to invade Eng|land.
A bill of attainder was therefore brought into the
lower hou&s;e immediately after fini&s;hing the&s;e pleadings; and
preparatory to it, a new proof of the Earl's guilt was pro|duced,
in order to remove &s;uch &s;cruples as might be enter|tained
with regard to a method of proceeding &s;o unu&s;ual and
irregular.</P>
<P>SIR Henry Vane, &s;ecretary, had taken down &s;ome notes
of a debate in council, after the di&s;&s;olution of the la&s;t par|liament;
and being at a di&s;tance, he had &s;ent the keys of
his cabinet, as was pretended, to his &s;on, Sir Henry, in
order to &s;earch for &s;ome papers, which were nece&s;&s;ary for
completing a marriage-&s;ettlement. Young Vane, falling

The que&s;tion before the council was; <HI>Offen&s;ive or defen&s;ive
war with the Scots.</HI> The King propo&s;es this difficulty,
&startq;But how can I undertake offen&s;ive war, if I have no more
money?&endq;
The an&s;wer a&s;cribed to Strafford was in the&s;e
words: Borrow of the city a hundred thou&s;and pounds:
Go on vigorou&s;ly to levy &s;hip-money. Your Maje&s;ty
having tried the affections of your people, you are ab|&s;olved
and loo&s;e from all rules of government, and may
do what power will admit. Your Maje&s;ty, having tried
all ways, &s;hall be acquitted before God and man. And
you have an army in Ireland, which you may employ to
reduce THIS kingdom to obedience: For I am confident
the Scots cannot hold out five months.&endq; There followed
&s;ome coun&s;els of Laud and Cottington, equally violent, with re|gard
to the King's being ab&s;olved from all rules of government<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Clarendon, vol. i. p. 223, 229, 230, &amp;c. Whitlocke, p. 41. May, p. 93.</NOTE></P>
<P>THIS paper, with all the circum&s;tances of its di&s;covery
and communication, was pretended to be equivalent to two
witne&s;&s;es, and to be an unan&s;werable proof of tho&s;e perni|cious
coun&s;els of Strafford, which tended to the &s;ubver&s;ion
of the laws and con&s;titution. But it was replied by Straf|ford
and his friends, That old Vane was his mo&s;t inveterate
and declared enemy; and if the &s;ecretary him&s;elf, as was
by far mo&s;t probable, had willingly delivered to his &s;on this
paper of notes, to be communicated to Pym, this implied
&s;uch a breach of oaths and of tru&s;t as rendered him totally
unworthy of all credit. That the &s;ecretary's depo&s;ition was
at fir&s;t exceedingly dubious: Upon two examinations, he
could not remember any &s;uch words: Even the third time,
his te&s;timony was not po&s;itive, but imported only, that
Strafford had &s;poke &s;uch or &s;uch-like words: And words
may be very like in &s;ound, and differ much in &s;en&s;e; nor
ought the lives of men to depend upon grammatical criti|ci&s;ms
of any expre&s;&s;ions, much le&s;s of tho&s;e delivered by
<PB N="345" REF="395">
the &s;peaker without premeditation, and committed by the
hearer, for any time, however &s;hort, to the uncertain record
of memory. That, in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, changing. <HI>This
kingdom</HI> into <HI>That kingdom,</HI> a very &s;light alteration$excl; the
Earl's di&s;cour&s;e could regard nothing but Scotland, and im|plies
no advice unworthy of an Engli&s;h coun&s;ellor. That
even retaining the expre&s;&s;ion, <HI>This kingdom,</HI> the words may
fairly be under&s;tood of Scotland, which alone was the king|dom
that the debate regarded, and which alone had thrown
off allegiance, and could be reduced to obedience. That it
could be proved, as well by the evidence of all the King's
mini&s;ters, as by the known di&s;po&s;ition of the forces, that
the intention, never was to land the Iri&s;h army in England,
but in Scotland. That of &s;ix other coun&s;ellors pre&s;ent,
Laud and Windebank could give no evidence; Northum|berland,
Hamilton, Cottington, and Juxon, could recol|lect
no &s;uch expre&s;&s;ion; and the advice was too remarkable
to be ea&s;ily forgot. That it was no-wi&s;e probable &s;uch a
de&s;perate coun&s;el would be openly delivered at the board,
and before Northumberland, a per&s;on of that high rank, and
who&s;e attachments to the court were &s;o much weaker than
his attachments to the country. That tho' Northumberland,
and he alone, had recolle$ted &s;ome &s;uch expre&s;&s;ion, as that
<HI>Of being ab&s;olved from rules of government;</HI> yet, in &s;uch
de&s;perate extremities as tho&s;e into which the King and king|dom
were then fallen, a maxim of that nature, allowing it
to be delivered by Strafford, may be defended, upon prin|ciples
the mo&s;t favourable to law and liberty. And that
nothing could be more iniquitous, than to extract an accu|&s;ation
of trea&s;on from an opinion &s;imply propo&s;ed at the
council-table; where all freedom of debate ought to be
permitted, and where it was not unu&s;ual for the members,
in order to draw forth the &s;entiments of others, to propo&s;e
coun&s;els very remote from their own &s;ecret advice and judg|ment<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Ru&s;hworth, vol. iv. p. 560.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="346" REF="396">
THE evidence of Secretary Vane, though expo&s;ed to
&s;uch un&s;urmountable objections, was the real cau&s;e of Straf|ford's
unhappy fate; and made the bill of attainder pa&s;s the
commons with no greater oppo&s;ition than that of fifty-nine
di&s;&s;enting votes.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bill of at|tainder.</NOTE> But there remained two other branches
of the legi&s;lature, the King and the lords, who&s;e a&s;&s;ent was
requi&s;ite; and the&s;e, if left to their free judgment, it was
ea&s;ily fores&s;een, would reject the bill without &s;cruple or deli|beration.
To overcome this difficulty, the popular leaders
employed expedients, for which they were beholden partly
to their own indu&s;try, partly to the imprudence of their
adver&s;aries.</P>
<P>NEXT Sunday after the bill pa&s;&s;ed the commons, the pu|ritanical
pulpits re&s;ounded with declamations concerning the
nece&s;&s;ity of executing ju&s;tice upon great delinquents<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Whitlocke, p. 43</NOTE>. The
populace took the alarm. About &s;ix thou&s;and men, armed
with &s;words and cudgels, &s;locked from the city, and fur|rounded
the hou&s;es of parliament<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Idem ibid.</NOTE> The names of the fifty-nine commoners, who had voted again&s;t the bill of at|tainder,
were po&s;red up under the title of <HI>Straffordians,
and betrayers of f their country.</HI> The&s;e were expo&s;ed to all
the in&s;ults of the ungovernable multitude. When any of
the lords paired, the cry for <HI>Justice</HI> again&s;t Strafford re&s;ounded
in their ears: And &s;uch as were &s;u&s;pected of friend&s;hip to
that obnoxious mini&s;ter, were &s;ure to meet with menaces,
not unaccompanied with &s;ymptoms of the mo&s;t de&s;perate re|&s;olutions
in the furious populace<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Clarendon, vol. i. p. 232, 256. Ru&s;h. vol. v. p. 248, 1279.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>COMPLAINTS in the hou&s;e of commons being made
again&s;t the&s;e violences as the mo&s;t &s;lagrant breach of privi|lege,
the ruling members, by their affected coolne&s;s and
indifference, &s;howed, plainily-, that the popular tumults were
not di&s;agreeable to them<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Whitlocke, ut &s;upra.</NOTE> But a-new di&s;covery, made about
<PB N="347" REF="397">
this time, &s;erved to throw every thing into &s;till greater
flame and combu&s;tion.</P>
<P>SOME principal officers, Piercy, Jermyn, O Neale, Goring,
Wilmot, Pollard, A&s;hburnham, partly attached to the court,
partly di&s;gu&s;ted with the parliament, had formed a plan of
engaging into the King's &s;ervice the Engli&s;h army, whom
they ob&s;erved to be di&s;plea&s;ed at &s;ome marks of preference
given by the commons to the Scots. For this purpo&s;e, they
entered into an a&s;&s;ociation, took an oath of &s;ecrecy, and
kept a clo&s;e corre&s;pondence with &s;ome of the King's &s;er|vants.
The form of a petition to the King and parliament
was concerted; and it was propo&s;ed to get this petition &s;ub|&s;cribed
by the army. The petitioners there repre&s;ent the
great and unexampled conce&s;&s;ions made by the King for the
&s;ecurity of public peace and liberty; the endle&s;s demands of
certain in&s;atiable and turbulent &s;pirits, whom nothing le&s;s will
content than a total &s;ubver&s;ion of the antient con&s;titution;
the frequent tumults which the&s;e factious malecontents had
excited, and which endangered the liberty of parliament.
To prevent the&s;e mi&s;chiefs, the army offered to come up
and guard that a&s;&s;embly. &startq;So &s;hall the nation,&endq; as they
expre&s;s them&s;elves in the conclu&s;ion, &startq;not only be $indi|cated
from precedent innovations, but be &s;ecured from
the future which are threatened, and which are likely to
produce more dangerous effects than the forme$<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Clarendon, vol. i. p. 247. whitlocke, p. 43.</NOTE>.&endq; The
draught of this petition being conveyed to the King, he was
prevailed on, &s;omewhat imprudently, to counter&s;ign $$$|&s;elf,
as a mark of his approbation. But as &s;everal difficul|ties
occurred, the project was laid a&s;ide two months before
any public di&s;covery was made of it.</P>
<P>IT was Goring who betrayed the &s;ecret to the popular
leaders. The alarm may ea&s;ily be imagined, which $word$ in|telligence
conveyed. Petitions from the military to the civil
<PB N="348" REF="398">
power are always looked on as di&s;gui&s;ed, or rather undi&s;|gui&s;ed
commands; and are of a nature widely different from
petitions pre&s;ented by any other rank of men. Pym opened
the matter in the hou&s;e<NOTE N="w" PLACE="foot">Ru&s;hworth, vol. v. p. 240.</NOTE>. On the fir&s;t intimation of a di&s;|covery,
Piercy concealed him&s;elf, and Jermyn withdrew be|yond
&s;ea. This farther confirmed the &s;u&s;picion of a dangerous
con&s;piracy. Goring delivered his evidence before the hou&s;e.
Piercy wrote a letter to his brother, Northumberland, con|fe&s;&s;ing
mo&s;t of the particulars<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Idem ibid. p. 255.</NOTE>. Both their te&s;timonies
agree with regard to the oath of &s;ecrecy; and as this cir|cum&s;tance
had been denied by Pollard, A&s;hburnham, and
Wilmot, in all their examinations, it was regarded as a
new proof of &s;ome de&s;perate re&s;olutions which had been
taken.</P>
<P>To convey more quickly the terror and indignation at
this plot, the commons voted, that a prote&s;tation &s;hould be
&s;igned by all the members. It was &s;ent up to the lords, and
&s;igned by all of them, except Southampton and Robarts.
Orders were given by the commons alone, without other
authority, that it &s;hould be &s;ub&s;cribed by the whole nation.
The prote&s;tation was in it&s;elf very inoffen&s;ive, and even in|&s;ignificant,
and contained nothing but general declarations
that the &s;ub&s;cribers would defend their religion and liber|ties<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Cla|rendon, vol. i. p. 252. Ru&s;h. vol. v. p. 241. Warwick, p. 180.</NOTE>. But it tended to increa&s;e the popular panic, and in|timated,
what was more expre&s;sly declared in the preamble,
that the&s;e ble&s;&s;ings were now expo&s;ed to the utmo&s;t peril.</P>
<P>ALARMS were every day given of new con&s;piracies<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Dug|dale, p. 69. Franklyn, p. 901.</NOTE>. In
Lanca&s;hire, great multitudes of papi&s;ts were gathering to|gether:
Secret meetings were held by them in caves and
under-ground in Surrey: They had entered into a plot to
blow up the river with gun-powder, in order to drown the
city<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Sir Edw. Walker, p. 349.</NOTE>: Provi&s;ions of arms were making beyond-&s;ea: Some|times
France, &s;ometimes Denmark, was forming de&s;igns
<PB N="349" REF="399">
again&s;t the kingdom: And the populace, who are always
terrified with pre&s;ent, and enraged with di&s;tant dangers,
were &s;till farther animated in their demands of ju&s;tice again&s;t
the unfortunate Strafford.</P>
<P>THE King came to the hou&s;e of lords: And tho' he ex|pre&s;&s;ed
his re&s;olution, for which he offered them any &s;ecu|rity,
never again to employ Strafford in any branch of pub|lic
bu&s;ine&s;s; he profe&s;&s;ed him&s;elf totally di&s;&s;atisfied with
regard to the circum&s;tances of trea&s;on, and on that account
declared his difficulty in giving his a&s;&s;ent to the bill of at|tainder<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Ru&s;hworth, vol. v. p. 239.</NOTE>.
The commons took fire, and voted it a breach
of privilege for the King to take notice of any bill depend|ing
before the hou&s;e. Charles did not perceive, that his at|tachment
to Strafford was the chief motive of the bill; and
that, the greater proofs he gave of anxious concern for this
mini&s;ter, the more inevitable did he render his de&s;truction.</P>
<P>ABOUT eighty peers had con&s;tantly attended Strafford's
trial; but &s;uch apprehen&s;ions were entertained on account
of the popular tumults, that only forty-five were pre&s;ent
when the bill of attainder was brought into the hou&s;e. Yet
of the&s;e, nineteen had the courage to vote again&s;t it. A
certain proof, that, if intire freedom had been allowed, the
bill had been rejected by a great majority.<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Whitlocl$e, p. 43.</NOTE></P>
<P>IN carrying up the bill to the lords, St. John, the &s;olicitor|general,
advanced two topics, well &s;uited to the fury of the
times; that, tho' the te&s;timony again&s;t Strafford were not
clear, yet, in this way of bill, private &s;atisfaction to each
man's con&s;cience was &s;ufficient, even &s;hould no evidence at
all be produced; and that the Earl had no title to plead
law, becau&s;e he had broke the law. It is true, added he,
we give law to hares and deer; for they are bea&s;ts of chace.
But it was never accounted either cruel or unfair to de&s;troy
foxes or wolves, where-ever they can be found; for they
are bea&s;ts of prey<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Cla|rendon, vol. i. p. 232.</NOTE>.

AFTER popular violence had prevailed over the lords;
the &s;ame batteries were next applied to force the King's a&s;|&s;ent.
The populace flocked about Whitehall, and accom|panied
their demand of ju&s;tice with the loude&s;t clamours
and mo&s;t open menaces. Rumors of con&s;piracies again&s;t
the parliament were anew &s;pread abroad: Inva&s;ions and in|&s;urrections
talked of: And the whole nation was rai&s;ed into
&s;uch a ferment, as threatened &s;ome great and imminent
convul&s;ion. On which-ever &s;ide the King ca&s;t his eyes, he
&s;aw no re&s;ource nor &s;ecurity. All his &s;ervants, con&s;ulting
their own &s;afety, rather than their ma&s;ter's honour, declined
interpo&s;ing with their advice between him and his parlia|ment.
The Queen, terrified with the appearance of &s;o
mighty a danger, and bearing formerly no good-will to
Strafford, was in tears, and pre&s;&s;ed him to &s;atisfy his people
in this demand, which, it was hoped, would finally content
them. Juxon alone, who&s;e courage was not inferior to his
other virtues, ventured to advi&s;e him, if, in his con&s;cience;
he did not approve of the bill, by no means to a&s;&s;ent to
it<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Clarendon, vol. i. p. 257. Warwick, p. 160.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>STRAFFORD, hearing of the King's irre&s;olution and an|xiety,
took a very extraordinary &s;tep: He wrote a letter, in
which he intreated the King, for the &s;ake of public peace,
to put an end to his unfortunate, however innocent life, and
to quiet the tumultuous people by granting them that re|que&s;t,
for which they were &s;o importunate<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Clarendon, ut &s;upra, p. 258. Ru&s;h. vol. v. p. 251.</NOTE>. &startq;In this,&endq;
added he, &startq;my con&s;ent will more acquit you to God than
all the world can do be&s;ides. To a willing man there is
no injury. And as, by God's grace, I forgive all the
world with a calmne&s;s and meekne&s;s, of infinite content|ment
to my di&s;lodging &s;oul; &s;o, Sir, to you, I can re|&s;ign
the life of this world with all imaginable chearful|ne&s;s,
in the ju&s;t acknowlegement of your exceeding fa|vours.&endq;
<PB N="351" REF="403">
Perhaps, Strafford hoped, that this unu&s;ual in|&s;tance
of genero&s;ity would engage the King &s;till more &s;tre|nuou&s;ly
to protect him: Perhaps, he gave his life for lo&s;t;
and finding him&s;elf in the hands of his enemies, and ob|&s;erving
that Balfour, the lieutenant of the Tower, was intirely
devoted to the popular party<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Whitlocke, p. 44. Franklyn, p. 896.</NOTE>; he ab&s;olutely de&s;paired of
ever e&s;caping the multiplied dangers with which he was
every-where invironed. We might a&s;cribe this &s;tep to a
noble effort of di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s not unworthy the great
mind of Strafford; if the mea&s;ure which he advi&s;ed had
not been, in the event, as pernicious to his ma&s;ter, as it
was immediately fatal to him&s;elf<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Mr. Carte, in his life of the duke of Ormond, has given us &s;ome evidence to prove, that this letter was intirely a forgery of the popular leaders, in order to induce the King to &s;acrifice Strafford. He tells us, that Strafford &s;aid &s;o to his &s;on, the night before his execution. But there are &s;ome rea&s;ons, why I adhere to the com|mon way of telling this &s;tory.

Sir George Ratcliffe, in his life $word$ Strafford, tells the &s;tory the &s;ame way that Clarendon and Whitlocke do. Would he al&s;o, who was Strafford's intimate friend, never have heard of the $word$? 'Tis remarkable, that this life is dedicated or addre&s;&s;ed to young Strafford. Would not he have put Sir George right in &s;o material and inter|esting a fact?</NOTE>.</P>
<P>AFTER the mo&s;t violent anxiety and doubt, Charles at
la&s;t granted a commi&s;&s;ion to four noblemen to give the royal
a&s;&s;ent, in his name, to the bill: Flattering him&s;elf, proba|bly,
in this extremity of di&s;tre&s;s, that, as neither his will
con&s;ented to the deed, nor was his hand immediately en|gaged
in it, he was the more free from all the guilt which
attended it. The&s;e commi&s;&s;ioners he impowered, at the
&s;ame time, to give a&s;&s;ent to the bill which rendered the par|liament
perpetual.

THE commons, from policy, more than from nece&s;&s;ity,
had embraced the expedient of paying the two armies by
borrowing money from the city; and this loan they had re|paid
afterwards by taxes levied upon the people. The citi|zens,
either of them&s;elves or by &s;ugge&s;tion, began to &s;tart
difficulties with regard to a farther loan which was de|manded.
We make no &s;cruple of tru&s;ting the parliament,
&s;aid they, were we certain that the parliament was to con|tinue
till our repayment. But, in the pre&s;ent precarious
&s;ituation of affairs, what &s;ecurity can be given us for our
money? In order to obviate this objection, a bill was &s;ud|denly
brought into the hou&s;e, and pa&s;&s;ed with great unani|mity
and rapidity, that the parliament &s;hould not be di&s;|&s;olved,
prorogued, nor adjourned, without their own con|&s;ent.
It was hurried in like manner thro' the hou&s;e of
peers; and was in&s;tantly carried to the King for his a&s;&s;ent.
Charles, in the agony of grief, &s;hame, and remor&s;e, for
Strafford's doom, perceived not that this other bill was of
&s;till more fatal con&s;equence to his authority; and rendered
the power of his enemies perpetual, as it was already un|controulable<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Clarendon, vol. i., p. 261, 262.</NOTE>.
In compari&s;on of the bill of attainder, by
which he deemed him&s;elf an accomplice in his friend's
murder, this conce&s;&s;ion made no figure in his eyes<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">What made this bill appear of le&s;s con&s;equence was, that the parliament voted ton|nage and poundage for no longer a period than two months: And as that branch was more than half of the revenue, and the government could not po&s;&s;ibly &s;ub&s;i&s;t without it; it &s;eemed indirectly in the power of the parlia|ment to continue them&s;elves as long as they plea&s;ed. This indeed was true in the ordinary admini&s;tration of government: But on the approaches towards a civil war, which was not then fore&s;een, it had been of great con&s;equence to the King to have re&s;erved the right of di&s;&s;olution, and to have &s;uffered any extremity, rather than allow the continuance of the parliament.</NOTE>: A
circum&s;tance, which, if it le&s;&s;ens our idea of his re&s;olution

<P>SECRETARY Carleton was &s;ent by the King to inform
Strafford of the final re&s;olution which nece&s;&s;ity had extorted

with an air even of greater dignity than what u&s;ually at|tended
him. He wanted that con&s;olation which commonly

and undaunted, found re&s;ources within it&s;elf, and maintained
its unbroken re&s;olution, amid&s;t the terrors of death, and
the triumphant exultations of his mi&s;guided enemies. His
di&s;cour&s;e on the &s;caffold was full of decency and courage.

<P>THUS peri&s;hed, in the 49th year of his age, the famous
Earl of Strafford, one of the mo&s;t eminent per&s;onages who
has appeared in England. Tho' his death was loudly de|manded
as a &s;atisfaction to ju&s;tice, and an atonement for the
many violations of the con&s;titution; it may &s;afely be af|firmed,
that the &s;entence, by which he fell, was an enormity
greater than the wor&s;t of tho&s;e which his implacable enemies
pro&s;ecuted with &s;o much cruel indu&s;try. The people, in
their rage, had totally mi&s;taken the proper object of their
re&s;entment. All the nece&s;&s;ities, or, more properly &s;peaking,
the difficulties, by which the King had been induced to u&s;e
violent expedients for rai&s;ing money, were the re&s;ult of
<PB N="355" REF="409">
mea&s;ures precedent to Strafford's favour; and if they aro&s;e
from ill conduct, he, at lea&s;t, was intirely innocent. Even
tho&s;e violent expedients them&s;elves, which occa&s;ioned the
complaint that the con&s;titution was &s;ubverted, had been, all
of them, conducted, &s;o far as appeared, without his coun|&s;el
or a&s;&s;i&s;tance. And whatever his private advice might be<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">That Strafford was &s;ecretly no enemy to arbitrary coun&s;els, appears from &s;ome of his letters and di&s;patches, particularly vol. ii. p. 60. where he &s;eems to wi&s;h that a &s;tanding army were e&s;tabli&s;hed.</NOTE>, this &s;alutary maxim he failed not, often and publickly,
to inculcate in the King's pre&s;ence, that, if any inevitable
nece&s;&s;ity ever obliged the &s;overeign to violate the laws, this
licence ought to be practi&s;ed with extreme re&s;erve, and, as
&s;oon as po&s;&s;ible, a ju&s;t atonement be made to the con&s;titu|tion,
for any injury which it might &s;u&s;tain from &s;uch dan|gerous
precedents<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Ru&s;hworth, vol. iv. p. 567, 568, 569, 570.</NOTE>. The fir&s;t parliament after the re&s;tora|tion
rever&s;ed the bill of attainder; and even a few weeks
after Strafford's execution, this very parliament remitted to
his children the more &s;evere con&s;equences of his &s;entence:
As if con&s;cious of the violence with which the pro&s;ecution
had been conducted.</P>
<P>IN vain did Charles expect, as a return for &s;o many
in&s;tances of unbounded compliance, that the parliament
would at la&s;t &s;how him &s;ome indulgence, and would cor|dially
fall into that unanimity, to which, at the expence of
his own power, and of his friend's life, he &s;o earne&s;tly
courted them. All his conce&s;&s;ions were poi&s;oned by their
&s;u&s;picion of his in&s;incerity; and the &s;uppo&s;ed attempt to
engage the army again&s;t them, &s;erved with many as a con|firmation
of this jealou&s;y. It was natural for the King to
&s;eek &s;ome re&s;ource, while all the world &s;eemed to de&s;ert
him, or combine again&s;t him; and this probably was the
utmo&s;t of that embryo-&s;cheme which was formed with regard
to the army. But the popular leaders &s;till in&s;i&s;ted, that a
de&s;perate plot was laid to bring up the forces immediately,
<PB N="356" REF="410">
and offer violence to the parliament: A de&s;ign of which
Piercy's evidence acquits the King, and which the near
neighbourhood of the Scots army seems to render ab&s;olutely
impracticable<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">The project of bringing up the army to London, according to Piercy, was propo&s;ed to the King; but he rejected it as fooli&s;h: Becau&s;e the Scots, who were in arms, and lying in their neighbourhood, mu&s;t be/at London as &s;oon as the Engli&s;h army. This rea&s;on is &s;o &s;olid and convincing, that it leaves no room to doubt of the veracity of Piercy's evidence; and con&s;equently acquits the King of this terrible plot of brining up the army, which made &s;uch a noi&s;e at that time, and was a pretence for &s;o many violences.</NOTE>. By means, however, of the&s;e &s;u&s;picions,
was the &s;ame implacable &s;pirit &s;till kept alive; and the com|mons,
without giving the King any &s;atisfaction in the &s;ettlement
of his revenue, proceeded to carry their inroads, with
great vigour, into his now defencele&s;s prerogative<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Clarendon, vol. i. p. 266.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE two ruling pa&s;&s;ions of this parliament,<NOTE PLACE="marg">High-com|i&s;&s;ion and &s;tar-cham|ber aboli&s;sh|ed.</NOTE> were zeal
for liberty, and an aver&s;ion to the church of England; and
to both of the&s;e, nothing could appear more exceptionable,
than the court of high-commi&s;&s;ion, who&s;e in&s;titution
ren|dered it intirely arbitrary, and a&s;&s;igned to it the defence of
the eccle&s;ia&s;tical e&s;tabli&s;hment. The &s;tar-chamber al&s;o was
a court, which exerted very high di&s;cretionary powers; and
had no preci&s;e rule or limit, either with regard to the cau&s;es
which came under its juri&s;diction, or the deci&s;ions which it
formed. A bill unanimou&s;ly pa&s;&s;ed the hou&s;es, to aboli&s;h
the&s;e two courts; and, in them, to annihilate the principal
and mo&s;t dangerous articles of the King's prerogative. By
the &s;ame bill, the juri&s;diction of the council was regulated,
and its authority abridged<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Idem ibid. p. 283, 284. Whitlocke, p. 47 Ru&s;hworth, vol. iii. p. 1383, 1384.</NOTE>. Charles he&s;itated before he
gave his a&s;&s;ent. But finding that he had gone too far to
retreat, and that he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed no re&s;ource in ca&s;e of a rup|ture,
he at la&s;t affixed the royal &s;anction to the&s;e excellent
bills. But, to &s;how the parliament that he was &s;ufficiently
appri&s;ed of the importance of his grant, he ob&s;erved to them,
that the&s;e new &s;tatutes altered in a great mea&s;ure the funda|mental
<PB N="357" REF="411">
laws, eccle&s;ia&s;tical and civil, which many of his pre|dece&s;&s;ors
had e&s;tabli&s;hed<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Ru&s;hworth, vol. v. p. 307.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BY removing the &s;tar-chamber, the King's power of bind|ing
the people by his proclamations, was indirectly abo|lished;
and that important branch of prerogative, the &s;trong
&s;ymbol of arbitrary power, and unintelligible in a limited
con&s;titution, being at la&s;t removed, left, the &s;y&s;tem of go|vernment
more con&s;i&s;tent and uniform. The &s;tar-chamber
alone was accu&s;tomed to puni&s;h infractions of the King's
edicts: But as no courts of judicature now remained, ex|cept
tho&s;e in We&s;tmin&s;ter-hall, which take cognizance only
of common and &s;tatute law, the King may thenceforth i&s;&s;ue
proclamations, but no man is bound to obey them. It mu&s;t,
however, be confe&s;&s;ed, that the experiment here made by
the parliament, was not a little ra&s;h and adventurous. No
government, at that time, appeared in the world, nor is per|haps
to be found in the records of any hi&s;tory, which &s;ub|&s;i&s;ted
without the mixture of &s;ome arbitrary authority, com|mitted
to &s;ome magi&s;trate; and it might rea&s;onably, before|hand,
appear doubtful, whether human &s;ociety could ever
arrive at that &s;tate of perfection, as to &s;upport it&s;elf with
no other controul, than the general and rigid maxims of law
and equity. But the parliament ju&s;tly thought that the
King was too eminent a magi&s;trate to be tru&s;ted with di&s;cre|tionary
power, which he might &s;o ea&s;ily turn to the de&s;tru|ction
of liberty. And in the event it has been found, that,
though &s;ome inconveniencies ari&s;e from the maxim of ad|hering
&s;trictly to law, yet the advantages &s;o much overba|lance
them, as &s;hould render the Engli&s;h for ever grateful
to the memory of their ance&s;tors, who, after repeated con|te&s;ts,
at la&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hed that noble principle.</P>
<P>AT the reque&s;t of the parliament, Charles, in&s;tead of the
patents during plea&s;ure, gave all the judges patents during

their good behaviour<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">May, p. 107.</NOTE>. A circum&s;tance of the greate&s;t
moment towards &s;ecuring their independency, and barring
the entrance of arbitrary power into the ordinary courts of
judicature.</P>
<P>THE mar&s;hal's court, which took cognizance of offen&s;ive
words, and was not thought &s;ufficiently limited by law, was
al&s;o, for that rea&s;on, aboli&s;hed<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Nal&s;on. vol. i. p. 778.</NOTE>. The &s;tannary courts,
which exerci&s;ed juri&s;diction over the miners, being liable to
a like objection, underwent a like fate. The abolition of
the council of the north and the council of Wales followed
from the &s;ame principles. The authority of the clerk of
the market, who had a general in&s;pection over the weights
and mea&s;ures throughout the kingdom, was transferred to
the mayors, &s;heriffs, and ordinary magi&s;trates.</P>
<P>IN &s;hort, if we take a &s;urve$ of the tran&s;actions of this
memorable parliament, during the fir&s;t period of their ope|rations,
we &s;hall find, that, excepting Strafford's attainder,
which was a complication of cruel iniquity, their merits, in
other-re&s;pects, &s;o much overbalance their mi&s;takes, as to in|title
them to very ample prai&s;es from all lovers of liberty.
Not only former complaints were remedied and grievances
redre&s;&s;ed: Great provi&s;ion, for the future, was made by
excellent laws again&s;t the return of like complaints. And if
the means, by which they obtain &s;uch mighty advantages,
favour often of artifice, &s;ometimes of violence; it is to be
con&s;idered, that revolutions of government cannot be effected
by the mere force of argument and rea&s;oning: And that
factions being once excited, men can neither &s;o firmly regu|late
the tempers of others, nor their own, as, to en&s;ure
them&s;elves again&s;t all exorbitances.</P>
<P>THE parliament now came to a pau&s;e. The King had
promi&s;ed his Scots &s;ubje&s;ts, that he would this &s;ummer pay
them a vi&s;it, in order to &s;ettle their government; and tho'
<PB N="359" REF="415">
the Engli&s;h parliament was very importunate with him,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">8th of Aug. King's journey to Scotland.</NOTE> that he &s;hould lay a&s;ide that journey, they could not pre|vail
with him &s;o much as to delay it. As he must nece&s;&s;arily
in his journey have pa&s;&s;ed through the troops of both na|tions,
the commons &s;eem to have entertained great jealou&s;y
on that account, and to have now hurried on, as much as
they formerly delayed, the di&s;banding the armies. The
arrears therefore of the Scots were intirely paid them; and
tho&s;e of the Engli&s;h in part. The Scots returned home,
and the Engli&s;h were &s;eparated into their &s;everal counties,
and di&s;mi&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>AFTER this,<NOTE PLACE="marg">9th of Sept.</NOTE> the parliament adjourned to the 20th of
October; and a committee of both hou&s;es, a thing altoge|ther
unprecedented, was appointed to fit during the rece&s;s,
with very ample powers<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Ru&s;hworth, vol. v. p. 387.</NOTE>. Pym was appointed chairman
of the lower hou&s;e. Farther attempts were made by the
parliament, while it &s;at, and even by the commons alone,
for a&s;&s;uming &s;overeign executive powers, and publi&s;hing
their ordinances, as they called them, in&s;tead of laws. The
committee too, on their parts, were ready to imitate this
example.</P>
<P>A SMALL committee of both hou&s;es were appointed to
attend the King into Scotland, in order, as it was pretended,
to &s;ee that the articles of pacification were executed; but
really to be &s;pies upon him, and extend &s;till farther the ideas
of parliamentary authority, as well as eclip&s;e the maje&s;ty of
the King. The Earl of Bedford, Lord Howard, Sir Philip
Stapleton, Sir William Armyne, Fiennes, and Hambden, were
the per&s;ons cho&s;en<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Idem ibid. p. 376.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>ENDEAVOURS were u&s;ed, before Charles's departure, to
have a protector of the kingdom appointed, with a power
to pa&s;s laws without having recour&s;e to the King. So
<PB N="360" REF="416">
little regard was now paid to royal authority, or to the e&s;ta|bli&s;hed
con&s;titution of the kingdom.</P>
<P>AMIDST the great variety of affairs which occurred du|ring
this bu&s;y period, we have almo&s;t overlooked the mar|riage
of the Prince&s;s Mary with William Prince of Orange.
The King concluded not this alliance without communicating
his intentions to the parliament, who received the propo&s;al
with &s;atisfaction<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Whitlocke, p. 38.</NOTE>. This was the commencement of the
connections with the family of Orange: Connections, which
were afterwards attended with the mo&s;t important con&s;e|quences,

<P>THE Scots, who fir&s;t began the&s;e fatal commotions,
thought, that they had fini&s;hed a very perilous un|dertaking,
much to their profit and reputation, Be&s;ides the
large pay voted them for lying in good quarters during a

In the articles of pacification, they were declared to have
ever been good &s;ubjects; and their military expeditions
were approved of, as enterprizes calculated and intended
for his Maje&s;ty's honour and advantage: To carry farther
the triumph over their &s;overeign, the&s;e terms, &s;o ignomi|nious

in the view of law and order e&s;tabli&s;hed by her victorious

barbarous zeal, and theological fervour, to the neighbouring
nations.</P>
<P>CHARLES,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Aug. 14</NOTE> de&s;poiled in England of a con&s;iderable part
of his authority, and dreading &s;till farther encroachments
upon him, arrived in Scotland,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Settlement of Scotland.</NOTE> with an intention of abdi|cating
almo&s;t intirely the &s;mall &s;hare of power, which <HI>there</HI>
remained to him, and of giving full &s;atisfaction, if po&s;&s;ible,
to his re&s;tle&s;s.&s;ubjects in that kingdom.</P>
<P>THE lords of articles were an antient in&s;titution in the
Scots parliament. They were con&s;tituted after this man|ner.
The lords cho&s;e eight bi&s;hops: The bi&s;hops elected
eight lords: The&s;e &s;ixteen named eight commi&s;&s;ioners of
counties, and eight burge&s;&s;es: And without the previous
con&s;ent of the thirty-two, who were denominated lords of
articles, no motion could be made in the parliament. As
the bi&s;hops were intirely devoted to the court, it is evident,
that all the lords of articles, by nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equence, de|pended
on the King's nomination; and the prince, be&s;ides
one negative after the bills pa&s;&s;ed through the parliament,
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed indirectly another before their introduction; a
prerogative of much greater con&s;equence than the former.
The bench of bi&s;hops being now aboli&s;hed, the parliament
wi&s;ely laid hold of the opportunity, and totally &s;et a&s;ide the
lords of articles: And till this important point was ob|tained,
the nation, properly &s;peaking, could not be &s;aid to
enjoy any regular freedom<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Burnet, Mem.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IT is remarkable, that, notwith&s;tanding this in&s;titution,
which had no parallel in England, the royal authority was
always deemed much lower in Scotland than in the former
kingdom. Bacon repre&s;ents it as one advantage to be ex|pected
<PB N="363" REF="421">
from the union, that the too exten&s;ive prerogative of
England would be abridged by the example of Scotland,
and the too narrow prerogative of Scotland be enlarged from
imitation of England. The Engli&s;h were, at that time, a
civilized people, and obedient to the laws: But among the
Scots, it was of little con&s;equence how the laws were
framed, or by whom voted, while the exorbitant ari&s;to|cracy
had it &s;o much in their power to prevent their regular
execution.</P>
<P>THE peers and commons formed only one hou&s;e in the
Scots parliament: And as it had been the practice of James,
continued by Charles, to grace Engli&s;h gentlemen with
Scots titles; all the determinations of parliament, it was
to be feared, would in time depend upon the prince, by
means of the&s;e votes of foreigners, who had no intere&s;t nor
concern in the nation. It was therefore a law, de&s;erving
great approbation, that no man &s;hould be capable of being
created a Scots peer, who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed not 10,000 marks
(above 500 pounds) of annual rent in the kingdom<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Burner, Mem.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>A LAW for triennial parliaments was likewi&s;e pa&s;&s;ed;
and it was ordained, that the la&s;t act of every parliament
&s;hould be to appoint the time and place for holding the par|liament
next en&s;uing<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Idem ibid.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE King was deprived of that power, formerly exer|ci&s;ed,
of i&s;&s;uing proclamations which enjoined obedience,
under the penalty of trea&s;on: A prerogative, which in|ve&s;ted
him with the whole legi&s;lative authority, even in
matters of the highe&s;t con&s;equence<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Idem ibid.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>So far was laudable: But the mo&s;t fatal blow given to
royal authority, and what, in a manner dethroned the
Prince, was the article, that no member of the privy
council, in who&s;e hands, during the King's ab&s;ence, the
whole admini&s;tration lay, no officer of &s;tate, none of the
<PB N="364" REF="422">
judges, &s;hould be appointed but by advice and approba|tion
of parliament. Charles even agreed to deprive, of
their &s;eats, four judges who had adhered to his intere&s;ts;
and their place was &s;upplied by others more agreeable to
the ruling party. Several of the covenanters were al&s;o
&s;worn of the privy council. And all the mini&s;ters of &s;tate,
coun&s;ellors, and judges, were, by law, to hold their places
during life or good behaviour<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Burnet, Mem.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE King, while in Scotland, conformed him&s;elf in|tirely
to the e&s;tabli&s;hed church; and a&s;&s;i&s;ted at the long
prayers and longer &s;ermons, with which the pre&s;byterians
endeavoured to regale him. He be&s;towed pen&s;ions and pre|ferments
on Hender&s;on, Gille&s;py, and other popular preachers;
and practi&s;ed every art to &s;often, if pot to gain, his greate&s;t
enemies. The Earl of Argyle was created a Marquis, Lord
Loudon an Earl, Le&s;ley was dignified with the title of Earl
of Leven<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Clarendon, vol. ii. p. 309.</NOTE>. His friends, he was obliged, for the pre&s;ent,
to neglect and overlook: Some of them were di&s;gu&s;ted:
And his enemies were not reconciled; but a&s;cribed all his
care&s;&s;es and favours to artifice and nece&s;&s;ity.</P>
<P>ARGYLE and Hamilton,<NOTE PLACE="marg">October 20.</NOTE> being &s;eized with an apprehen|&s;ion,
real or counterfeit, that the Earl of Crawfurd and
others intended to a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate them, left the parliament &s;ud|denly,
and retired into the country: But upon invitation
arid a&s;&s;urances, returned in a few days. This event, which
had neither cau&s;e nor effect that was vi&s;ible, nor purpo&s;e,
nor con&s;equence, was commonly denominated the <HI>incident.</HI>
But though this event had no effect in Scotland; what was
not expected, it was attended with con&s;equences in England.
The Engli&s;h parliament, which was now a&s;&s;embled, being
willing to awaken the people's tenderne&s;s by exciting their
fears, immediately took the alarm; as if the malignants, &s;o

them<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Whitlocke, p. 49. Dugdale, p. 72. Burnet's Memoirs of the Hou&s;e of Hamilton, p. 184, 185. Clarendon, p. 299.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BUT while the King was employed in pacifying the com|motions
in Scotland, and was preparing to return to Eng|land,
in order to apply him&s;elf to the &s;ame &s;alutary work in
that kingdom; he received intelligence of a dangerous re|bellion
broke out in Ireland, with circum&s;tances of 'the ut|mo&s;t.
horror, blood&s;hed, and deva&s;tation. On every &s;ide,
this unfortunate Prince was pur&s;ued with murmurs, di&s;con|tent,
faction, and civil wars; and the fire, from all quar|ters,
even by the mo&s;t independent accidents, at once blazed
up about him.</P>
<P>THE great plan of James, in the admini&s;tration of Ireland,
continued by Charles, was, by ju&s;tice and peace to recon|cile
that turbulent people to the authority of laws, and, in|troducing
art and indu&s;rry among them, to cure that &s;loth
and barbari&s;m to which they had ever been &s;ubject. In or|der
to &s;erve both the&s;e purpo&s;es, and, at the &s;ame time, &s;e|cure
the dominion of Ireland to the Engli&s;h crown, great
colonies of Briti&s;h had been carried over, and, being inter|mixed
with the Iri&s;h, had every where introduced a new
face of things into that country. During a peace of near
forty years, the inveterate quarrels between die nations &s;eem|ed,
in a great mea&s;ure, to be obliterated; and though much
of the landed property, forfeited by rebellion, had been
conferred on the new planters, a more than equal return had
been made, by their in&s;tructing the natives in tillage, build|ing,
manifactures, and all the civilized arts of life<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Sir John Tem|ple Iri&s;h Rebellion, p. 12.</NOTE>. This
had been the cour&s;e of things during the &s;ucce&s;&s;ive admi|ni&s;trations
of Chiche&s;ter, Grandi&s;on, Falkland, and, above
all, of Strafford. Under the government of this la&s;t no|bleman

the pacific plans, now come to greater maturity,
and forwarded by his vigour and Indu&s;try, &s;eemed to have
operated with full &s;ucces&s;s, and to have be&s;towed, at la&s;t,
on that &s;avage country, the face of an European &s;ettle|ment.</P>
<P>AFTER Strafford fell a victim to popular rage, the ru|mours,
excited in Ireland by that great event, could not
&s;uddenly be compo&s;ed; but continued to produce the greate&s;t
innovations in the government.</P>
<P>THE Briti&s;h prote&s;tants tran&s;planted into Ireland, having,
every moment, before their eyes all the horrors of popery,
had naturally been carried into the oppo&s;ite extreme, and
had univer&s;ally adopted the highe&s;t principles and practices
of the puritans. Monarchy, as well as the hierarchy, was
become odious to them; and every method of limiting the
authority of the crown, and detaching them&s;elves from the
King of England, was greedily adopted and pur&s;ued. They
con&s;idered not, that, as they &s;carce compo&s;ed the &s;ixth part
of the people, and were &s;ecretly obnoxious to the antient
inhabitants; their only method of. &s;upporting them&s;elves
was by maintaining royal authority, and pre&s;erving a great
dependance on their mother-country. The Engli&s;h com|mons
likewi&s;e, in their furious pro&s;ecution of Strafford,
had overlooked the mo&s;t obvious con&s;equences; and, while
they imputed to him, as a crime, every di&s;cretionary act of
authority, they de&s;poiled all &s;ucceeding governors of that
power, by which alone the Iri&s;h could be retained in &s;ub|jection.
And &s;o &s;trong was the current for popular go|vernment
in all the three kingdoms, that the mo&s;t establi&s;|ed
maxims of policy were every where abandoned, in order
to gratify this ruling pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>CHARLES, unable to re&s;i&s;t, had been obliged to yield
to the Iri&s;h, as to the Scots and Engli&s;h parliaments; and
found too, that their encroachments &s;till ro&s;e in proportion
to his conce&s;&s;ions. Tho&s;e &s;ub&s;idies, which them&s;elves had
<PB N="367" REF="427">
voted, they reduced, by a &s;ub&s;equent vote, to a fourth part:
The court of high commi&s;&s;ion was determined to be a griev|ance:
Martial law aboli&s;hed: The juri&s;diction of the council
annihilated: Proclamations and acts of &s;tate declared of no
authority: Every order or in&s;titution, which depended on
monarchy, was invaded; and the Prince was de&s;poiled of
all his prerogative, without the lea&s;t pretext of any violence
or illegality in his admini&s;tration.</P>
<P>THE &s;tanding army of Ireland was u&s;ually abont 3000
men; but in order to a&s;&s;i&s;t the King in &s;uppre&s;&s;ing the Scots
covenanters, Strafford had rai&s;ed 8000 more, and had in|corporated
with them a thou&s;and men, drawn from the old
army; a nece&s;&s;ary expedient for be&s;towing order and di&s;ci|pline
on the new-levied &s;oldiers. The private men in this
army were all catholics; but the officers, both commi&s;&s;ion
and non-commi&s;&s;ion, were prote&s;tants, and could intirely be
depended on by Charles. The Engli&s;h commons enter|tained
the greate&s;t apprehen&s;ions on account of this army;
and never cea&s;ed &s;oliciting the King, till he agreed to break
it: Nor would they con&s;ent to any propo&s;als for augment|ing
the &s;tanding army to 5000 men; a number which
the King judged requi&s;ite for retaining Ireland in obe|dience.</P>
<P>CHARLES, thinking it dangerous, that 8000 men, ac|cu&s;tomed
to idlene&s;s, and trained to the u&s;e of arms, &s;hould
be di&s;per&s;ed among a nation &s;o turbulent and un&s;ettled,
agreed with the Spani&s;h amba&s;&s;ador to have them tran&s;ported
into Flanders, and inli&s;ted in his ma&s;ter's &s;ervice. The
Engli&s;h commons, apprehen&s;ive, that regular bodies of
troops, di&s;ciplined in the Low Countries, would prove &s;till
more dangerous, &s;howed &s;ome aver&s;ion to this expedient;
and the King reduced his allowance to 4000 men. But
when the Spaniards had hired &s;hips for tran&s;porting the&s;e
Droops, and the men were ready for embarkation; the com|mons,
willing to &s;how their power, and not di&s;plea&s;ed with
<PB N="368" REF="428">
an opportunity of curbing and affronting the King, prohi|bited
every one from furni&s;hing ve&s;&s;els for that &s;ervice.
And thus the project, formed by Charles, of freeing the
country from the&s;e men, was unfortunately di&s;appointed<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Clarendon, vol. i. p. 281. Ru&s;hworth, vol. v. p. 381. Dugdale, p. 75. May, book ii. p. 3.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE old Iri&s;h catholics remarked all the&s;e fal&s;e &s;teps
of the Engli&s;h, and re&s;olved to take advantage of them.
Though their animo&s;ity again&s;t that nation, for want of an
occa&s;ion to exert it&s;elf, &s;eemed to be extingui&s;hed, it was
only compo&s;ed into a temporary and deceitful tranquillity<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Temple, p. 14.</NOTE>.
Their intere&s;ts, both with regard to <HI>property</HI> and to <HI>reli|gion,</HI>
&s;ecretly &s;imulated them to a revolt. No individual
of any &s;ept, according to the antient cu&s;toms, had the pro|perty
of any particular e&s;tate; but as the Whole &s;ept had
a title to a whole territory, they ignorantly preferred this
barbarous community before the more &s;ecure and narrower
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions a&s;&s;igned them by the Engli&s;h. An indulgence,
amounting almo&s;t to a toleration, had been given the catho|lic
religion: But &s;o long as the churches and the eccle&s;ia&s;ti|cal
revenues were kept from the prie&s;ts, and they were
obliged to endure the neighbourhood of profane heretics,
being them&s;elves di&s;contented, they endeavoured continually
to retard any cordial reconcilement between the Engli&s;h and
the Iri&s;h nations.</P>
<P>THERE was a gentleman,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Con&s;piracy in Ireland.</NOTE> called Roger More, who,
though of a narrow fortune, was de&s;cended from a very
antient Iri&s;h family, and was much celebrated among his
countrymen for valour and capacity. This man fir&s;t formed
the project of expelling the Engli&s;h, and a&s;&s;terting the inde|pendency
of his native country<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Nal&s;on vol. ii. p. 543.</NOTE>. He &s;ecretly went from
chieftain to chieftain, and rouzed up every latent principle
of di&s;content. He maintained a clo&s;e corre&s;pondence with
Lord Maguire and Sir Phelim O Neale, the mo&s;t powerful of
<PB N="369" REF="429">
the old Iri&s;h. By conver&s;ation, by letters, by his emi&s;&s;aries,
he repre&s;ented to his countrymen the motives of a revolt.
He ob&s;erved to them, That, by the rebellion of the Scots,
and factions of the Engli&s;h, the King's authority in Britain
was reduced to &s;o low a condition, that he never could ex|ert
him&s;elf with any vigour, in maintaining the Engli&s;h do|minion
over Ireland; that the catholics, in the Iri&s;h hou&s;e
of commons, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the prote&s;tants, had &s;o dimini&s;hed
the royal prerogative and the power of the lieutenant, as
would much facilitate the conducting, to its de&s;ired effect,
any con&s;piracy or combination, which could be formed;
that the Scots, having &s;o &s;ucce&s;sfully thrown off dependance
on the crown of England, and a&s;&s;umed the government into
their own hands, and &s;et an example to the Iri&s;h, who had
&s;o much greater oppre&s;&s;ions to complain of; that the Engli&s;h
planters, who had expelled them their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, &s;uppre&s;&s;ed
their religion, and bereaved them of their liberties, were
but a handful in compari&s;on of the natives; that they lived
in the mo&s;t &s;upine &s;ecurity, inter&s;per&s;ed. with their numerous
enemies, tru&s;ting to the protection of a &s;mall army, which
was it&s;elf &s;cattered in incon&s;iderable divi&s;ions throughout
the whole kingdom; that a great body of men, di&s;ciplined
by the government, were now thrown loo&s;e, and were
ready for any daring or de&s;perate enterprize; that though
the catholics had hitherto enjoyed, in &s;ome tolerable mea|&s;ure,
the exerci&s;e of their religion, from the moderation of
their indulgent prince, they mu&s;t henceforth expect, that
the government will be conducted by other maxims and
other principles; that the puritanical parliament, having at
la&s;t &s;ubdued their &s;overeign, would, no doubt, &s;o &s;oon as
they had con&s;olidated their authority, extend their ambi|tious
enterprizes to Ireland, and make the catholics in that
kingdom feel the &s;ame furious per&s;ecution, to which their
brethren in England were at pre&s;ent expo&s;ed; and that a
revolt in the Iri&s;h, tending only to vindicate their native
liberty again&s;t the violence of foreign invaders, could never,
<PB N="370" REF="430">
at any time, be deemed rebellion; much le&s;s, during the
the pre&s;ent confu&s;ions, when their Prince was, in a man|ner,
a pri&s;oner, and obedience mu&s;t be paid, not to him,
but to tho&s;e who had traiterou&s;ly u&s;urped his lawful au|thority<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Temple, p 72, 73, 78. Dugdale, P. 73.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BY the&s;e con&s;iderations, More engaged all the heads of
the native Iri&s;h into the con&s;piracy. The Engli&s;h of the
pale, as they were called, or the old Engli&s;h planters, being
all catholics, it was hoped, would afterwards join the party,
which re&s;tored their religion to its antient &s;plendor and au|thority.
The intention was, that Sir Phelim Oneale, and the
other con&s;pirators, &s;hould begin an in&s;urrection on one day,
throughout the provinces, and &s;hould attack all the Engli&s;h
&s;ettlements; and that, on the very &s;ame day, Lord Maguire
and Roger More &s;hould &s;urprize the ca&s;tle of Dublin. The
commencement of this revolt they fixed on the approach of
winter; that there might be more difficulty in tran&s;porting
forces from England. Succours to them&s;elves and &s;upplies
of arms they expected from France, in con&s;equence of a
promi&s;e made them by Cardinal Richelieu. And many Iri&s;h
officers, who &s;erved in the Spani&s;h troops, had given a&s;&s;u|rances
of their concurrence, &s;o &s;oon as they &s;aw an in&s;ur|rection
entered upon by their catholic brethren. News,
which every day arrived from England, of the fury
expre&s;&s;ed by the commons again&s;t all papi&s;ts, &s;truck fre&s;h
terror into the Iri&s;h nation, and both &s;timulated the con|&s;pirators
to execute their fatal purpo&s;e, and gave them a&s;&s;ured
hopes of the concurrence of their countrymen<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Dugdale, p. 74.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>SUCH propen&s;ity to a revolt was di&s;covered in all
the Iri&s;h, that it was deemed unnece&s;&s;ary, as it was dangerous,
to entru&s;t the &s;ecret to many hands; and the appointed day
drew nigh, nor had any di&s;covery been yet made to the go|vernment.
The King, indeed, had received information
from his amba&s;&s;adors, that &s;omething was in agitation
<PB N="371" REF="431">
among the Iri&s;h in foreign parts; but though he gave warn|ing
to the admini&s;tration in Ireland, the intelligence was in|tirely
neglected<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Ru&s;hworth, vol. v. p. 408. Nal&s;on, vol. ii. p. 565.</NOTE>. Secret rumours, likewi&s;e, were heard
of &s;ome approaching con&s;piracy; but no attention was paid
to them. The Earl of Leice&s;ter, whom the King had ap|pointed
lieutenant, remained in London. The two ju&s;tices;
Sir William Par&s;ons and Sir John Borlace, were men of
&s;mall ability, and, by an inconvenience common to all fac|tious
times, owed their advancement to nothing but their
zeal for that party, by whom every thing was now govern|ed.
Tranquil from their ignorance and inexperience, the&s;e
men indulged them&s;elves in the mo&s;t profound repo&s;e, on
the very brink of de&s;truction.</P>
<P>BUT they were awakened from their &s;ecurity, the very
day before that appointed for the commencement of ho&s;tilities.
The ca&s;tle of Dublin, by which the capital was
commanded, contained arms for 10,000 men, with thirty|five
pieces of cannon, and a proportionable quantity of
ammunition: Yet was this important place guarded, and
that too without any care, by no greater force than fifty
men. Maguire and More were already in town with a
numerous band of their retainers: Others were expected
that night: And, next morning, they were to enter upon,
what they e&s;teemed the ea&s;ie&s;t of all enterprizes, the fur|prizal
of the ca&s;tle. Oconolly, an Iri&s;hman, but a pro|te&s;tant,
betrayed the &s;ecret to Par&s;ons<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Ru&s;h vol. v. p. 399. Nal&s;on, vol. ii. p. 520. May, book ii. p. 6.</NOTE>. The ju&s;tices and
council, for &s;afety, fled immediately into the ca&s;tle; and
re-inforced the guards. The alarm was conveyed to the
city, and all the prote&s;tant prepared for defence. More
e&s;caped Maguire was taken; and Mahone, one of the
con&s;pirators, being likewi&s;e &s;eized, fir&s;t di&s;covered, to the
ju&s;tices, the project of a general in&s;urrection, and redoubled
<PB N="372" REF="432">
the apprehend&s;ions<NOTE PLACE="marg">Iri&s;h in&s;urrection and ma&s;&s;acre.</NOTE>, which were already univer&s;ally diffu&s;ed
throughout Dublin<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Temple, p. 17, 18, 19, 20. Ru&s;hworth, vol. v. p. 400.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BUT though Oconolly's di&s;covery &s;aved the ca&s;tle from a
&s;urprize, the confe&s;&s;ion, extorted from Mahone, came too
late to prevent the intended in&s;urrection. Oneale and his
confederates had already taken arms in Ul&s;ter. The Iri&s;h,
every where intermingled with the Engli&s;h, needed but a
hint from their leaders and prie&s;ts to begin ho&s;tilities again&s;t
a people, whom they hated on account of their religion,
and envied for their riches and pro&s;perity<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Temple, p. 39, 40, 79.</NOTE>. The hou&s;es,
cattle, goods, of the unwary Engli&s;h were fir&s;t &s;eized.
Tho&s;e, who heard of the commotions in their neighbour|hood,
in&s;tead of de&s;erting their habitations, and flocking
together for mutual protection, remained at home, in hopes
of defending their property; and fell thus &s;eparately into
the hands of their enemies<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Idem, p. 42.</NOTE>. After rapacity had fully
exerted it&s;elf, cruelty, and the mo&s;t barbarous, that ever,
in any nation, was known or heard of, began its operations.
An univer&s;al ma&s;&s;acre commenced of the Engli&s;h, now de|fencele&s;s,
and pa&s;&s;ively re&s;igned to their inhuman foes. No
age, no &s;ex, no condition, was &s;pared. The wife weeping
for her butchered hu&s;band, and embracing her helple&s;s
children, was pierced with them, and peri&s;hed by the &s;ame
&s;troke<NOTE N="w" PLACE="foot">Idem, p. 40.</NOTE>. The old, the young, the vigorous, the infirm,
underwent a like fate, and were confounded in one com|mon
ruin. In vain did &s;light &s;ave from the fir&s;t a&s;&s;ault:
De&s;truction was, every where, let loo&s;e, and met the hunted
victims at every turn. In vain was recour&s;e had to relations,
to companions, to friends: All connexions were di&s;&s;olved,
and death was dealt by that hand, from which protection
was implored and expected. Without provocation, with|out
oppo&s;ition, the a&s;toni&s;hed Engli&s;h, living in profound
peace and full &s;ecurity, were ma&s;&s;acred by their neare&s;t
<PB N="373" REF="433">
neighbours, with whom they had long upheld a continued
intercour&s;e of kindne&s;s and good offices<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Temple, p. 39, 40.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BUT death was the lighte&s;t puni&s;hment, inflicted by
tho&s;e more than barbarous &s;avages: All the tortures, which
wanton cruelty could devi&s;e, all the lingering pains of body,
the angui&s;h of mind, the agonies of de&s;pair, could not &s;a|tiate
revenge excited without injury, and cruelty derived
from no cau&s;e. To enter into particulars would &s;hock the
lea&s;t delicate humanity. Such enormities, though atte&s;ted
by undoubted evidence, appear almo&s;t incredible. De|praved
nature, even perverted religion, though encouraged
by the utmo&s;t licence, reach not to &s;uch a pitch of ferocity;
unle&s;s the pity, inherent in human brea&s;ts, be destroyed by
that contagion of example, which tran&s;ports men beyond
all the u&s;ual motives of conduct and behaviour.</P>
<P>THE weaker &s;ex them&s;elves, naturally tender to their
own &s;ufferings, and compa&s;&s;ionate to tho&s;e of others, here
emulated their more robu&s;t companions, in the practice of
every cruelty<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Idem, p. 96, 101. Ru&s;h. vol. v. p. 415.</NOTE>. Even children, taught by the example,
and encouraged by the exhortation, of their parents, e&s;&s;ayed
their feeble blows on the dead carca&s;&s;es or defencele&s;s
children of the Engli&s;h<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Temple, p. 100.</NOTE>. The very avarice of the Iri&s;h
was not a &s;ufficient re&s;traint to their cruelty. Such was
their frenzy, that the cattle, which they had &s;eized, and by
rapine had made their own, yet, becau&s;e they bore the
name of Engli&s;h, were wantonly &s;laughtered, or, when
covered with wounds, turned loo&s;e into the woods and

<P>THE &s;tately buildings or commodious habitations of the
planters, as if upbraiding the &s;loth and ignorance of the

ground. And where the mi&s;erable owners, &s;hut up
in their hou&s;es, and preparing for defence, peri&s;hed in

the fate of their unhappy countrymen<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Whitlocke, p. 47. Ru&s;hworth, vol. v. p. 416.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>OTHERS, more ingenious &s;till in their barbarity, tempted
their pri&s;oners, by the fond love of life, to embrue their
hands in the blood of friends, brothers, parents; and

that death, which they &s;ought to &s;hun by de&s;erving it<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Temple, p. 100.</NOTE>.</P>

The Engli&s;h, as heretics, abhorred of God, and de|te&s;table

SUCH were the barbarities, by which Sir Phelim Oneale
and the Iri&s;h in Ul&s;ter &s;ignalized their rebellion: An event,
memorable in the annals of human kind, and worthy to be
held in perpetual dete&s;tation and abhorrence. The generous
nature of More was &s;hocked at the recital of &s;uch enormous

was too feeble to re&s;train their inhumanity.
Soon after, he abandoned a cau&s;e, polluted with &s;o many
crimes; and he retired into Flanders. Sir Phelim, recom|mended
by the greatne&s;s of his family, and perhaps too,
by the unre&s;trained brutality of his nature; though without
any courage or capacity, acquired the intire a&s;cendant over the northern rebels<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Temple, p. 44.</NOTE>. The Engli&s;h colonies were totally
annihilated in the open country of Ul&s;ter: The Scots, at
fir&s;t met with more favourable treatment. In order to
engage them to a pa&s;&s;ive neutrality, the Iri&s;h pretended to
di&s;tingui&s;h between the Briti&s;h nations; and claiming friend&s;hip
and con&s;anguinity with the Scots, extended not over
them the fury of their ma&s;&s;acres. Many of them found an
opportunity to fly the country: Others retired into places
of &s;ecurity, and prepared them&s;elves for defence: And by
this means, the Scots planters, mo&s;t of them at lea&s;t,
e&s;caped with their lives<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Idem, p. 41. Ru&s;h, vol. i. p. 416.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>FROM Ul&s;ter, the flames of rebellion diffu&s;ed them&s;elves,
in an in&s;tant, over the other three provinces of Ireland. In
all places, death and &s;laughter were not uncommons; tho'
the Iri&s;h, in the&s;e other provinces, pretended to act with
more moderation and humanity. But cruel and barbarous
was their humanity! Not contented with expelling the
Engli&s;h their hou&s;es, with de&s;poiling them of their goodly
manors, with wa&s;ting their cultivated fields; they &s;tripped
them of their very cloaths, and turned them out naked and

climate, and executed what the mercile&s;s &s;word of the bar|barians
had left unfini&s;hed<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Idem, p. 64.</NOTE>. The roads were covered with
crowds of naked Engli&s;h, ha&s;tening towards Dublin and the
other cities, which yet remained in the hands of their
countrymen. The feeble age of children, the tender &s;ex of
women, &s;oon &s;unk under the multiplied rigours of cold and
hunger. Here, the hu&s;band, bidding a final adieu to his
expiring family, envied them that fate, which he him&s;elf
expected &s;o &s;oon to &s;hare: There, the &s;on, having long &s;up|ported
his aged parent, with reluctance obeyed his la&s;t com|mands,
and abandoning him in 'this uttermo&s;t di&s;tre&s;s, re|&s;erved
him&s;elf to the hopes of avenging that death, which
all his efforts could not prevent nor delay. The a&s;toni&s;hing
greatne&s;s of the calamity deprived the &s;ufferers of any relief
from the view of companions in affliction. With &s;ilent
tears, or lamentable cries, they hurried on through the
ho&s;tile territories; and &s;ound every heart, which was not
&s;teel'd by native barbarity, guarded by the more implaca|ble
furies of mi&s;taken piety and religion<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Idem, p. 88.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE &s;aving of Dublin pre&s;erved in Ireland the remains
of the Engli&s;h name. The gates of that city, though ti|morou&s;ly

what any eye had ever before beheld<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Idem, p. 62.</NOTE>. Compa&s;&s;ion &s;eized

on the weak re&s;ources, by which they were them|&s;elves
&s;upported. The more vigorous of the unhappy fu|gitives,
to the number of three thou&s;and, were inli&s;ted into

and all care was taken, by diet and warmth, to recruit their
feeble and torpid limbs. Di&s;ea&s;es of unknown name and

of them, and put a &s;peedy period to their lives: Others,
having now lei&s;ure to reflect on their mighty lo&s;s of friends
and fortune, cur&s;ed that being which they had &s;aved.
Abandoning them&s;elves to de&s;pair, refu&s;ing all &s;uccour, they
expired; without other con&s;olation, than that of receiving,
among their countrymen, the honours of a grave, which,
to their &s;laughtered companions, had been denied by the

<P>THE justices ordered to Dublin all the bodies of the
army, which were not &s;urrounded by the rebels; and they
a&s;&s;embled a force of 1500 veterans. They &s;oon inli&s;ted,
and armed from the magazines above 4000 men more.
They di&s;patched a body of 600 men to throw relief into
Tredah, be&s;ieged by the Iri&s;h. But the&s;e troops, attacked
by the enemy, were &s;eized with a panic, and were mo&s;t of
them put to the &s;word. Their arms, falling into the hands
of the Iri&s;h, &s;upplied them with what they mo&s;t wanted<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Nal&s;on, vol. ii. p. 905.</NOTE>.
The ju&s;tices afterwards thought of nothing more than the
providing for their own &s;ecurity and that of the capital.

&s;uch timid coun&s;els; but was obliged to &s;ubmit to au|thority.</P>
<P>THE Engli&s;h of the pale, who probably were not, at fir&s;t,

their prote&s;tations and declarations, they engaged the ju&s;tices
to &s;upply them with arms, which they promi&s;ed to employ
in de&s;ence of the government<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Temple, p. 60. Borla&s;e His;t. p. 28.</NOTE>. But in a little time, the
intere&s;ts of religion were found more prevalent over them
than regard and duty to their native country. They cho&s;e
Lord Gorman&s;tone their leader; and, joining the old Iri&s;h,
rivaled them in every act of cruelty towards the Engli&s;h
prote&s;tants. Be&s;ides many &s;maller bodies, di&s;per&s;ed over
the whole kingdom, the principal army of the rebels
amounted to twenty thou&s;and men, and threatened Dublin
with an immediate &s;iege<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Whitlocke, p. 49.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BOTH the Engli&s;h and Iri&s;h rebels con&s;pired in one im|po&s;ture,
with which they &s;educed many of their deluded
countrymen: They pretended authority from the King and
Queen, but chiefly from the latter, for their in&s;urrection;
and they affirmed, that the cau&s;e of their taking arms, was
to vindicate royal prerogative, now invaded by the purita|tanical
parliament<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Ru&s;h, vol. v. p. 400, 401.</NOTE>. Sir Phelim Oneale, having found a
royal patent in Lord Caufield's hou&s;e, whom he had mur|dered,
tore off the &s;eal, and affixed to it a commi&s;&s;ion,
which he had forged for him&s;elf<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Idem ibid. p. 402.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE King received an account of this in&s;urrection by a
me&s;&s;enger, di&s;patched from the north of Ireland. He im|mediately
communicated his intelligence to the Scots par|liament,
He expected, that the mighty zeal, expre&s;&s;ed by
the Scots, for the prote&s;tant religion, would immediately
engage them to fly to its defence, where it was &s;o violently
invaded: He hoped, that their horror again&s;t popery, a re|ligion
which now appeared in its mo&s;t horrible a&s;pect,
would &s;econd all his exhortations: He had ob&s;erved with
what alacrity they had twice run to arms, and a&s;&s;embled
troops in oppo&s;ition to the rights of their &s;overeign: He
&s;aw with how much greater facility they could now collect
<PB N="379" REF="439">
forces, which had been very lately di&s;banded, and which
had been &s;o long enured to military di&s;cipline. The cries of
their affrighted and di&s;tre&s;s;ed brethren in Ireland, he pro|mis;ed
him&s;elf, would powerfully incite them to &s;end over
&s;uccours, which could arrive &s;o quickly, and aid them with
&s;uch promptitude in this uttermos;t di&s;tre&s;s. But the zeal
of the Scots, as is u&s;ual among religious &s;ects, was very
&s;eeble, when not &s;timulated either by faction or by intere&s;t.
They now con&s;idered them&s;elves intirely as a republic, and
made no account of the authority of their prince, which
they had utterly annihilated, Conceiving hopes from the
pre&s;ent di&s;lre&s;s;es of Ireland, they re&s;olved to make an ad|vantageous
bargain for the &s;uccours, with which they
&s;hould &s;upply their neighbouring nation. And they cas;t
their eye on the Engli&s;li parliament, with whom they were
already &s;o clos;ely connected, and who could alone fulfil any
articles which might be agreed on. Except di&s;patching a
&s;mall body to &s;upport the Scots colonies in Ul&s;ter, they
would, therefore, go no farther at pre&s;ent, than to &s;end
commi&s;&s;ioners to London, in order to treat with that power,
to whom the &s;overeign authority was now in reality tran&s;|ferred<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Ru&s;h. vol. v. p. 407.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE King too, &s;en&s;ible of his utter inability to &s;ubdue
the Iri&s;h rebels, found him&s;elf obliged, in this exigency, to
have recour&s;e to the Engli&s;h parliament, and depend on
their a&s;&s;i&s;tance for &s;upply. After communicating to them
the intelligence which he had received, he informed them,
that the in&s;urreclion was not, in his opinion, the re&s;ult of
any ra&s;h enterprize, but of a formed con&s;piracy again&s;t the
crown of England. To their care and wi&s;dom, therefore,
he &s;aid, he committed the conduct and pro&s;ecution of the
war, which, in a cau&s;e &s;o important to national and reli|gious
intere&s;ts, mu&s;t. of nece&s;&s;ity be immediately entered upon, and vigorou&s;ly pur&s;ued<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Clarendon, vol. ii. p. 301.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="380" REF="440">
THE Engli&s;h parliament was now a&s;&s;embled;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Meeting of the Engli&s;h parliament.</NOTE> and di&s;co|vered,
in every vote, the &s;ame di&s;po&s;itions in which they
had &s;eparated. The exalting their own authority, the di|mini&s;hing
the King's, were &s;till the objects pur&s;ued by the
majority. Every attempt, which had been made to gain
the popular leaders, and by offices to attach them to the
crown, had failed of &s;ucce&s;s, either for want of &s;kill in
conducting it, or by rea&s;on of the &s;lender preferments which
it was then in the King's power to confer. The ambitious
and enterpri&s;ing patriots di&s;dained to accept, in detail, of a
precarious power; while they e&s;teemed it &s;o ea&s;y, by one bold
and vigorous a&s;&s;ault, to po&s;&s;e&s;s them&s;elves for ever of the in|tire
&s;overeignty of the &s;tate. Sen&s;ible that the mea&s;ures which
they had hitherto pur&s;ued, rendered them extremely ob|noxious
to the King; were many of them in them&s;elves ex|ceptionable;
&s;ome of them, &s;trictly &s;peaking, illegal; theyre|&s;olved
to &s;eek their own &s;ecurity, as well as greatne&s;s, by enlarg|ing
popular authority in England. The great nece&s;&s;ities to
which the King was reduced; the violent prejudices which
generally, throughout the nation, prevailed again&s;t him;
his facility in making the mo&s;t important conce&s;&s;ions; the
example of the Scots, who&s;e encroachments had totally
&s;ubverted monarchy: All the&s;e circum&s;tances farther in&s;ti|gated
the commons in their inva&s;ion of royal prerogative.
And the danger, to which the con&s;litution &s;eemed to have
been &s;o lately expo&s;ed, per&s;uaded many, that it never could
be &s;ufficiently &s;ecured, but by the intire abolition of that
authority which had invaded it.</P>
<P>BUT this project, it had not been in the power, &s;carce
in the intention, of the popular leaders to execute, had it
not been for the pa&s;&s;ion which &s;eized the nation for pre&s;by|terian
di&s;cipline, and for the wild enthu&s;ia&s;m which at that
time accompanied it. The licence which the parliament
had be&s;towed on this &s;pirit, by checking eccle&s;ia&s;tic autho|rity;
the countenance and encouragement with which they
had honoured it; had alrealy diffu&s;ed its influence to a won|derful
<PB N="381" REF="441">
degree: And all orders of men had drunk deep of
the intoxicating poi&s;on. In each di&s;cour&s;e or conver&s;ation,
this mode of religion entered; in all bu&s;in&s;s, it had a &s;hare;
every elegant plea&s;ure or amu&s;ement, it utterly annihilated;
many vices or corruptions of mind, it promoted; even di&s;|ea&s;es
and bodily di&s;tempers were not totally exempted from
it; and it became requi&s;ite, we are told, for all phy&s;icians
to be expert in the &s;piritual profe&s;&s;ion, and, by theological
con&s;iderations, to allay tho&s;e religious terrors with which
their patients were &s;o generally haunted. Learning it&s;elf,
which tends &s;o much to enlarge the mind, and humanize the
temper, rather &s;erved on this occa&s;ion to exalt that epi|demical
frenzy which prevailed. Rude as yet, and imper|fect,
it &s;upplied the di&s;mal fanatici&s;m with a variety of
views, founded it on &s;ome coherency of &s;y&s;tem, enriched
it with different figures of elocution; advantages with which
a people, totally ignorant and barbarous, had been happily
unacquainted.</P>
<P>FROM policy, at fir&s;t, and inclination, now from nece&s;&s;ity,
the King attached him&s;elf extremely to the hierarchy:
For like rea&s;ons, his enemies made account, by one and
the &s;ame effort, to overpower the church and monarchy.</P>
<P>WHILE the commons were in this di&s;po&s;ition, the Iri&s;h
rebellion was the event which tended mo&s;t to promote the
views in which all their mea&s;ures terminated. A horror
again&s;t the papi&s;ts, however innocent, they had con&s;tantly
encouraged; a terro$ again&s;t the con&s;piracies of that &s;ect,
however improbable, they had at all times endeavoured to
excite. Here was broke out a rebellion, dreadful and un|expected;
accompanied with circum&s;tances the mo&s;t dete&s;t|able,
of which there ever was any record: And what was
the peculiar guilt of the Iri&s;h catholics, it was no difficult
matter, in the pre&s;ent di&s;po&s;ion of men's minds, to at|tribute
to that whole &s;ect, who already were &s;o much the
object of general abhorrence. Accu&s;tomed, in all invec|tives,
<PB N="382" REF="442">
to join the prelatical party with the papi&s;t, the people
immediately &s;uppo&s;ed this in&s;urrection to be the re&s;uit of
their united coun&s;els. And when they heard that the Iri&s;h
rebels pleaded the King's commi&s;&s;ion for all their violences;
bigotry, ever credulous and malignant, a&s;&s;ented without
&s;cruple to that gro&s;s impo&s;ture, and loaded the unhappy
prince with the whole enormity of a contrivance &s;o barba|rous
and inhuman<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">It is now &s;o univer&s;ally allowed, notwith&s;tanding &s;ome muttering to the contrary, that the King had no hand in the Iri&s;h rebellion, that it will be &s;uperfluous to in&s;i&s;t on a point which &s;cems &s;o clear. I &s;hall only &s;ugge&s;t a very few arguments, among an infinite number which occur. (1) Ought the affirmation of per&s;idious, infamous rebels ever to have pa&s;&s;ed for any autho|rity? (2) Nobody can tell us what the words of the pretended commi&s;&s;ion were. That commi&s;&s;ion which we find in Ru&s;hworth, vol. v. p. 400, and in Milton's works, Toland's edition, is plainly an impo&s;ture; becau&s;e it pre|tends to be dated in October 1641, yet mentions facts which happened not till &s;ome months after. It appears that the Iri&s;h rebels, ob&s;erving &s;ome incon&s;i&s;tence in their fir&s;t forgery, were obliged to forge this commi&s;&s;ion anew, yet could not render it coherent nor probable. (3) Nothing could more obvi|ou&s;ly be pernicious to the King's cau&s;e than the Iri&s;h rebellion; becau&s;e it increa&s;ed his necc&s;&s;ities, and rendered him &s;till more dependent on the parlia|ment, who had before sufficiently &s;hown oil what terms they would a&s;&s;i&s;t him. (4) The in&s;tant the King heard of the rebellion which was a very few days after its commencement, he wrote to the parliament, and gave over to them the management of the war. Had he built any projects on that rebellion, would he not have waited &s;ome little time, to &s;ee how they would &s;ucceed? Would he pre&s;ently have adopted, a mea&s;ure which was obviou&s;ly &s;o hurtful to his authority? (5) What can be imagined to be the King's projects? To rai&s;e the Iri&s;h to arms, I &s;uppo&s;e, and bring them over to England for his a&s;&s;i&s;tance. But is it not plain, that the King never intended to rai&s;e war in England? Had that been his intention, would he have rendered the parlia|ment perpetual? Does it not appear, by the whole train of events, that the parliament forced him into the war? (6) The King conveyed to the ju&s;tices intelligence which ought to have prevented the rebellion. (7) The Iri&s;h ca|tholics, in all their future tran&s;actions with the King, where they endeavoar to excu&s;e their in&s;urrection, never had the a&s;&s;urance to plead his commi&s;&s;ion. Iven among&s;t them&s;elves they dropped that pretext. It appears that Sir Phc|$im Oneale, chiefly, and he only at fir&s;t, prompted that impo&s;ture. See Carte's Ormond, vol. iii. No 100, 111, 112, 114, 115, 121, 132, 137. (8) Oneale him&s;elf confe&s;&s;ed the impo&s;ture on his trial and at his execution. Sea Nal&s;on, vol. ii, p. 528. (9) It is ridiculous to mention the ju&s;tification which Charles II. gave to the Marquis of Antrim, as if he had acted by his father's commi&s;&s;ion. Antrim had no hand in the fir&s;t rebellion and the ma&s;&s;acre. He joined not the rebels till two years after, and he performed important &s;ervices to the King, in &s;ending over a body of men to Montro&s;e.</NOTE>.</P>

BY the difficulties and di&s;tre&s;&s;es of the crown, the com|mons,
who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;d alone the power of &s;upply, had ag|grandized
them&s;elves; and it &s;eemed a peculiar happine&s;s,
that the Iri&s;h. rebellion had &s;ucceeded, at &s;o critical a junc|ture,
to the pacification of Scotland. That expre&s;&s;ion of
the King, by which he committed to them the care of Ire|land,
they immediately laid hold of, and interpreted in the
mo&s;t unlimited &s;en&s;e. They had, on other occa&s;ions, been
gradually encroaching on the executive power of the crown,
which forms its principal and mo&s;t. natural branch of au|thority;
but, with regard to Ireland, they at once a&s;&s;umed
it, fully and intirely, as if delivered over to them by a regu|lar
gift or a&s;&s;ignment. And to this u&s;urpation the King
was obliged pa&s;&s;ively to &s;ubmit; both becau&s;e of his ina|bility
to re&s;i&s;t, and le&s;t he &s;hould expo&s;e him&s;elf &s;till more
to the reproach of favouring the progre&s;s of that odious
rebellion.</P>
<P>THE project of introducing farther innovations in Eng|land
being once formed by the leaders among the commons,
it became a nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equence, that their operations with
regard to Ireland would, all of them, be considered as &s;ubordinate
to the former, on who&s;e &s;ucce&s;s, when once under|taken,
their own grandeur, &s;ecurity, and even being, mu&s;t
intirely depend. While they pretended the utmo&s;t zeal
again&s;t the Iri&s;h in&s;urrection, they took no &s;teps towards its
&s;uppre&s;&s;ion, but &s;uch as likewi&s;e tended to give them the
&s;uperiority in tho&s;e commotions, which they fore&s;aw mu&s;t
&s;o &s;oon be excited in England<NOTE N="w" PLACE="foot">Clarendon, vol. ii p. 435, Sir Ed, Walker, p. 6.</NOTE>. The extreme contempt
entertained towards the natives in Ireland, made the popular
leaders believe that it would be ea&s;y at any time to &s;uppre&s;s
their rebellion, and recover that kingdom: Nor were they
<PB N="384" REF="444">
willing to lo&s;e, by too ha&s;ty &s;ucce&s;s, the advantage which
that rebellion would afford them in their projected encroach|ments
on the prerogative. By a&s;&s;uming the total manage|ment
of the war, they acquired the courtship and depend|ence
of every one who had any connexion with Ireland, or
who was de&s;irous of inli&s;ting in the&s;e military enterprizes:
They levied money under pretence of the Iri&s;h expedition;
but re&s;erved it for purpo&s;es which concerned them more
nearly: They took arms from the King's magazines; but
&s;till kept them, with? $ecret intention of employing them
again&s;t him&s;elf: Whatever law they deemed nece&s;&s;ary for
aggrandizing them&s;elv$ was voted, under colour of en|abling
them to recover Ireland; and if Charles with-held
the royal a&s;&s;ent, his refu&s;al was imputed to tho&s;e pernicious
coun&s;els which had a$word$ excited the popi&s;h rebellion, and
which &s;tiil threatened total destruction to the prote&s;tant
intere&s;t throughout all his dominions<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Nal&s;on, vol. ii. p. 618. Clarendon, vol. iv. p. 590.</NOTE>. And though no
forces were for a long time &s;ent over to Ireland, and very
little money remitted, during the extreme di&s;tre&s;s of that
kingdom; &s;o &s;trong was the people's attachment to the
commons, that the fault was never imputed to tho&s;e pious
zealots, who&s;e votes breathed nothing but death and de|&s;truction
to the Irish rebels.</P>
<P>To make the attack on royal authority by regular ap|proaches,
it was thought proper to form a general remon|&s;trance
of the &s;tate of the kingdom; and accordingly the
committee, which, at the fir&s;t meeting of the parliament,
had been cho&s;en for that purpo&s;e, and which had hitherto
made no advance in their work, received fre&s;h injunctions
to fini&s;h that undertaking.</P>
<P>THE committee brought into the hou&s;e that remon&s;trance
which has become &s;o memorable,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The remon|&s;trance.</NOTE> and which was &s;oon after|wards
attended with &s;uch important con&s;equences. It was

not addre&s;&s;ed to the King; but was openly declared to be
an appeal to the people. The har&s;hne&s;s of the matter was

of many gro&s;s fal&s;hoods, intermingled with &s;ome evident

Loud complaints of the pa&s;t, accompanied with
jealous prognostications of the future. Whatever un|fortunate,
whatever invidious, whatever &s;u&s;picious mea|&s;ure,
had been embraced by the King from the commence|ment
of his reign, is in&s;i&s;ted on and aggravated with merci|le&s;s
rhetoric: The un&s;ucce&s;sful expedition to Cadiz and the
i&s;le of Rh$ are mentioned: The &s;ending &s;hips to France for
&s;uppre&s;&s;ion of the hugonots: The forced loans: The ille|gal
confinement of men for not obeying illegal commands.
The violent di&s;&s;oludon of four parliaments: The arbitrary
government which always &s;ucceeded: The que&s;tioning,
fining, and impri&s;oning members for their conduct in the
hou&s;e: The levying taxes without content of the commons.
The introducing &s;uper&s;litious innovations into the church,
without authority of law: In &s;hort, every thing, which,
either with or without rea&s;on, had given offence, during
the cour&s;e of fifteen years, from the acce&s;&s;ion of the King
to the calling of the pre&s;ent parliament. And, though all
the&s;e grievances had been already redre&s;&s;ed, and even laws
enacted for future &s;ecurity again&s;t their return, the prai&s;e of
all the&s;e advantages was a&s;cribed, not to the King, but to the
parliament, who had extorted his con&s;ent to &s;uch &s;alutary
&s;latutes. Their own merits too, they a&s;&s;erted, towards the
King, were equally great, as towards the people. Though
they had &s;eized his whole revenue, rendered it totally preca|rious,
and made even their temporary &s;upplies be paid in to
their own commi&s;ioners, who were independent of him;
they pretended, that they had very liberally &s;upported him
in his nece&s;&s;ities. By an in&s;ult &s;till more egregious, the
very giving money to the $word$, for levying war again&s;t
their &s;overeign, they repre&s;ented as an in&s;tance of their duty
<PB N="386" REF="446">
towards him. And all their grievances, they &s;aid, which
amounted to no le&s;s than a total &s;ubver&s;ion of the con&s;titu|tion,
proceeded intirely from the formed combination of a
popi&s;h faction, who had ever &s;wayed the king's coun&s;els,
who had endeavoured, by an uninterrupted effort, to intro|duce
their &s;uper&s;tition into England and Scotland, and who
had now, at la&s;t, excited an open and bloody rebellion in
Ireland<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Ru&s;h. vol. v. p. 438. Nal&s;on, vol. ii. p. 694.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THIS remon&s;trance,<NOTE PLACE="marg">22d Nov.</NOTE> &s;o full of acrimony and violence,
was a plain &s;ignal for &s;ome farther attacks intended on royal
prerogative, and a declaration, that the conce&s;&s;ions, already
made, however important, were not to be regarded as &s;a|tisfactory.
What preten&s;ions would be advanced, how un|precedented,
how unlimited, were ea&s;ily imagined; and
nothing le&s;s was &s;ore&s;een, whatever ancient names might be
pre&s;erved, than an abolition, almo&s;t total, of the monar|chical
government of England. The oppo&s;ition, therefore,
which the remon&s;trance met with in the hou&s;e of commons,
was very great. For above fourteen hours, the debate was
warmly managed; and from the wearine&s;s of the King's
party, which probably con&s;i&s;ted chiefly of the elderly peo|ple,
and men of cool &s;pirits, the vote was at la&s;t carried by
a &s;mall majority of eleven<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Whitlocke, p. 49 Dugdale, p. 71. Nal&s;on, ubi &s;up. p. 668.</NOTE>. Some time after, the remon|&s;trance
was ordered to be printed and publi&s;hed, without
being carried up, as is u&s;ual in &s;uch ca&s;es, to the hou&s;e of
peers, for their a&s;&s;ent and approbation.</P>
<P>WHEN this remon&s;trance was di&s;per&s;ed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rea&s;ons on both &s;ides.</NOTE> it excited every|where
the &s;ame violent controver&s;y which attended it when
introduced into the hou&s;e of commons. This parliament,
&s;aid the partizans of that a&s;&s;embly, have at la&s;t pro&s;ited by
the fatal example of their predece&s;&s;ors; and are re&s;olved
that the fabric, which they have generou&s;ly undertaken to
rear for the protection of liberty, &s;hall not be left to future

ages in&s;ecure and imperfect. At the time when the petition
of right, that requi&s;ite vindication of a violated con&s;titu|tion,
was extorted from the unwilling prince; who but
ima|gined, that liberty was at la&s;t &s;ecured, and that the laws
would thenceforth maintain them&s;elves in oppo&s;ition to arbi|trary
authority? But what was the event? A <HI>right</HI> was in|deed
acquired to the people, or rather their antient right
was more exactly defined: But as the <HI>power</HI> of invading it
&s;till remained in the prince, no &s;ooner did an opportunity
offer, than he totally di&s;regarded all laws and preceding en|gagements,
and made his will and plea&s;ure the &s;ole rule of
government. Tho&s;e lofty ideas of monarchical government,
which he had derived from his early education, which are
united in his mind with the irre&s;i&s;tible illu&s;ions of &s;elf-love,
which are corroborated by his mi&s;taken principles of reli|gion,
it is in vain to hope, that, in his more advanced age,
he will &s;incerely renounce, from any &s;ub&s;equent reflection or
experience. Such conver&s;ions, if ever they happen, are ex|tremely
rare; but to expect that they will be derived from
nece&s;&s;ity, from the jealou&s;y and re&s;entment of antagoni&s;ts,
from blame, from reproach, from oppo&s;ition, mu&s;t be
the re&s;ult of the fonde&s;t and mo&s;t blind credulity. The&s;e vio|lences,
however nece&s;&s;ary, are &s;ure to irritate a prince again&s;t
limitations &s;o cruelly impo&s;ed upon him; and each conce&s;|&s;ion,
which he is inforced to make, is regarded as a tem|porary
tribute paid to faction and &s;edition, and is &s;ecretly
attended with a re&s;olution of &s;eizing every favourable oppor|tunity
to retract it. Nor &s;hould we imagine, that oppor|tunities
of that kind will not offer in the cour&s;e of human
affairs. Governments, e&s;pecially tho&s;e of a mixed kind,
are in continual fluctuation: The humours of the people
change perpetually from one extreme to another: And no
re&s;olution can be more wife, as well as more ju&s;t, than that
of employing the pre&s;ent advantages again&s;t the King, who
had formerly pu&s;hed much le&s;s tempting ones to the ut|mo&s;t
extremity again&s;t his people and his parliament. It
<PB N="388" REF="448">
is to be feared, that if the religious rage, which has &s;eized
the multitude, be allowed to evaporate, they will quickly
return to the antient eccle&s;ia&s;tical e&s;tabli&s;hment; and em|brace,
with it, tho&s;e principles of &s;lavery which it incul|cates
with &s;uch zeal on its &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive pro&s;elytes. Tho&s;e pa|triots,
who are now the public idols, may then become the
objects of general dete&s;tation; and equal &s;houts of joy at|tend
their ignominious execution, with tho&s;e which &s;econd
their pre&s;ent advantages and triumphs. Nor ought the ap|prehen&s;ion
of &s;uch an event to be regarded in them as a
&s;elfi&s;h con&s;ideration: In their &s;afety is involved the &s;ecurity
of the laws: The patrons of the constitution cannot &s;uffer
without a fatal blow to the con&s;titution: And it is but ju&s;|tice
in the public to protect, at any hazard, tho&s;e who have
&s;o generou&s;ly expo&s;ed them&s;elves to the utmo&s;t hazard for
the public intere&s;t. What though monarchy, the antient
government of England, be impaired, during the&s;e con|te&s;ts,
in many of its former prerogatives: The laws will
flouri&s;h the more by its decay; and it is happy, allowing
that matters are really carried beyond the bounds of mode|ration,
that the current at lea&s;t runs towards liberty, and
that the error is on that &s;ide which is &s;afe&s;t for the general
intere&s;ts of mankind and &s;ociety.</P>
<P>THE be&s;t arguments of the royali&s;ts again&s;t a farther in|va&s;ion
of the prerogative, were founded more on oppo&s;ite
ideas which they had formed of the pa&s;t events of this
reign, than on oppo&s;ite principles of government. Some
inva&s;ions, they &s;aid, and tho&s;e too of no &s;mall con&s;equence
had undoubtedly been made on national privileges: But
were we to look for the cau&s;e of the&s;e violences, we &s;hould
never find it to con&s;i&s;t in the wanton tyranny and inju&s;tice
of the prince, not even in his ambition or immoderate ap|petite
for authority. The ho&s;tilities with Spain, in which
the King, on his acce&s;&s;ion, found him&s;elf engaged, how|ever
imprudent and unnece&s;&s;ary, had proceeded from the
advice, and even importunity of the parliament,; who de|&s;erted
<PB N="389" REF="449">
him immediately after they had embarked, him in
tho&s;e warlike mea&s;ures. A young prince, jealous of ho|nour,
was naturally afraid of being foiled in his fir&s;t enter|prize,
and had not as yet attained &s;uch maturity of coun&s;el,
as to perceive that his greate&s;t honour lay in pre&s;erving the
laws inviolate, and gaining the intire confidence of his
people. The rigour of the &s;ub&s;equent parliaments had been
extreme with regard to many articles, particularly tonnage
and poundage; and had reduced the King to an ab&s;olute
nece&s;&s;ity, if he would pre&s;erve intire the royal prerogative,
of levying tho&s;e duties by his own authority, and of break|ing
through the forms, in order to maintain the &s;pirit of
the con&s;titution. Having once made &s;o perilous a &s;tep, he
was naturally induced to continue, and to con&s;ult the public
intere&s;t, by impo&s;ing &s;hip-money, and other moderate, tho'
irregular, burthens and taxations. It is now full time to
free him from all the&s;e nece&s;&s;ities, and to apply cordials and
lenitives, after tho&s;e &s;everities which have already had their, full
cour&s;e again&s;t him. Never &s;overeign was ble&s;&s;ed with more
moderation of temper, with more ju&s;tice, more humanity,
more honour, or a more magnanimous di&s;po&s;ition. What
pity that &s;uch a prince &s;hould &s;o long have been harra&s;&s;ed
with rigours, &s;u&s;picions, calumnies, complaints, encroach|ments;
and been forced from that path, in which the recti|tude
of his di&s;po&s;ition would have inclined him to have
con&s;tantly trod! If &s;ome few in&s;tances are found of viola|tions
made on the petition of right, which he him&s;elf had
granted; there is an ea&s;ier and more natural way for pre|venting
the return of like inconveniences, than by a total
abolition of royal authority. Let the revenue be &s;ettled,
&s;uitable to the antient dignity and &s;plendor of the crown;
let the public nece&s;&s;ities be fully &s;upplied; let the remaining
articles of prerogative be left untouched: And the King, as
he has already lo&s;t the power, will lay a&s;ide the will, of in|vading
the con&s;titution. From what quarter can jealou&s;ies
<PB N="390" REF="450">
now ari&s;? What farther&s;ecurity can be de&s;ired or ex|pected?
The King's precedent conce&s;&s;ions, &s;o far from. be|ing
in&s;u&s;&s;icient for public &s;ecurity, have rather erred on the
other extreme; and, by depriving him of all power of &s;elf|defence,
are the real cau&s;e why the commons are embold|ened
to rai&s;e preten&s;ions hitherto unheard of in the king|dom,
and to &s;ubvert the whole, &s;y&s;tem of the con&s;titution.
But would they be contented with moderate advantages, is
it not evident, that, be&s;ides other important conce&s;&s;ions,
the pre&s;ent parliament may be continued till the government
is accu&s;tomed to the new track, and every part is re&s;tored
to full harmony and concord? By the triennial act, a per|petual
&s;ucce&s;&s;ion of parliaments is e&s;tabli&s;hed, as everla&s;ting
guardians to the laws; while the king po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es no independ|ent
power or military force, by which he can be &s;upported
in his inva&s;ion of them. No danger remains, but what is
in&s;eparable from all free con&s;titutions, and what forms the
very e&s;&s;ence of their liberty: The danger of a change in
the people's di&s;po&s;ition, and of general di&s;gu&s;t, contracted
again&s;t popular privileges. To prevent &s;uch an evil, no
expedient is more proper, than to contain our&s;elves within
the bounds of moderation, and to con&s;ider, that all ex|tremes,
naturally and infallibly, beget each other. In the
&s;ame manner as the pa&s;t u&s;urpations of the crown, however
excu&s;able on account of the nece&s;&s;ity or provocations from
whence they aro&s;e, have excited an immea&s;urable appetite
for liberty; let us beware, left our encroachments, by in|troducing
anarchy, make the people &s;eek &s;helter under the
peaceable and de&s;potic rule of a monarch. Authority, as
well as liberty, is requi&s;ite to government; and is even re|qui&s;ite
to the &s;upport of liberty it&s;elf, by maintaining the
laws which can alone regulate and protect it. What mad|ness,
while every thing is &s;o happily &s;ettled under antient
forms and in&s;titutions, now more exactly poi&s;ed and adjusted,
to try the hazardous experiment of a new con&s;titution, and
<PB N="391" REF="451">
renounce the mature wi&s;dom of our ance&s;tors for the crude
whim&s;ies of turbulent innovators! Be&s;ides the certain and
inconceivable mi&s;chie&s;s of civil war; are not the perils ap|parent,
which the delicate frame of liberty mu&s;f inevitably
run amid&s;t the furious &s;hock of arms? Whichever &s;ide pre|vails,
<HI>she</HI> can &s;carce hope to remain inviolate, and may &s;uf|fer
no le&s;s or rather greater injuries from the boundle&s;s pre|tensions
of forces engaged in her cau&s;e, than from the in|va&s;ion
of inraged troops, inli&s;ted on the &s;ide of monarchy.</P>
<P>THE King, upon his return from Scotland,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nov. 25</NOTE> was received
in London with the &s;houts and acclamation: of the people,
and with every demon&s;tration of regard and affection<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Ru&s;hworth, vol. v. p. 429.</NOTE> Sir Richard Gournay, lord mayor, a man of merit and au|thority,
had promoted the&s;e, &s;avourable di&s;po&s;itions, and had
engaged the populace, who &s;o lately in&s;ulted the King, and
who &s;o &s;oon afterwards made furious war upon him, to give
him the&s;e marks of the mo&s;t dutiful attachment. But all
the plea&s;iure which he reaped from this joyful reception was
&s;oon damped by the remon&s;trance of the commons, which
was pre&s;ented him; together with a petition of a like &s;train.
The had coun&s;els which he followed, are there complained
of; his concurrence in the Iri&s;h rebellion plainly in&s;inuated;
the &s;cheme, laid for the introduction of popery and &s;uper|&s;tition,
inveighed again&s;t; and, for a remedy to all the&s;e
evils, he is de&s;ired to intru&s;t every office and command to

the memorials and addre&s;&s;es of that time, the commons meant
them&s;elves and their adherents.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the remon&s;trance of the commons was pub|li&s;hed,
the King di&s;per&s;ed an an&s;wer to it. In this conte&s;t,
he lay under mighty di&s;advantages. Not only the ears of
the people were extremely prejudiced again&s;t him; the be&s;t
<PB N="392" REF="452">
topics upon which he could ju&s;tify, or at lea&s;t apologize for
his former conduct, were &s;uch as it was not &s;afe nor prudent
for him at this time to employ. So high was the national
idolatry towards parliaments, that to blame the pa&s;t conduct
of the&s;e a&s;&s;emblies, had been very ill received by the gene|rality
of the people: So loud were the complaints again&s;t
regal u&s;urpations, that had the King a&s;&s;erted the preroga|tive
of &s;upplying, by his own authority, the de&s;iciencies in
government, ari&s;ing from the ob&s;tivacy of parliaments, he
would have increa&s;ed the clamours with which the whole
nation already re&s;ounded. Charles, therefore, contented
him&s;elf with ob&s;erving, in general, that even during that
period, &s;o much complained of, the people enjoyed a great
mea&s;ure of happine&s;s, not only comparatively, in re&s;pect of
their neighbours, but even in re&s;pect of tho&s;e times which
were ju&s;tly accounted the mo&s;t fortunate. He made warm
prote&s;tations of &s;incerity in the reformed religion; he pro|mi&s;ed
indulgence to tender con&s;ciences with regard to the
ceremonies of the church; he mentioned his great conce&s;|&s;ions
to national liberty; he blamed the infamous libels
every-where di&s;per&s;ed again&s;t his per&s;on and the national
religion; he complained of the general reproaches thrown
out in the remon&s;trance, with regard to ill coun&s;els, though
he had protected no mini&s;ter from parliamentary ju&s;tice,
retained no unpopular &s;ervant, and conferred offices on no
one who enjoyed not a high character and e&s;timation in the
public. &startq;If, notwith&s;tanding this,&endq; he adds, &startq;any ma|lignant
party &s;hall take heart, and be willing to &s;acrifice
the peace and happine&s;s of their country to their own
&s;mi&s;ter ends and ambition, under whatever pretence of
religion and con&s;cience; if they &s;hall endeavour to le&s;&s;en
my reputation and intere&s;t, and to weaken my lawful
power and authority; if they &s;hall attempt, by di&s;coun|tenancing
the pre&s;ent laws, to loo&s;en the bands of go|vernment,

upon us; doubt not but God, in his good time, will

my high court of parliament will join with me in their
&s;uppre&s;&s;ion and puni&s;hment<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Nal&s;on, vol. ii. p. 748.</NOTE> Nothing &s;hows more
evidently the hard &s;ituation in which Charles was placed,
than to ob&s;erve, that he was obliged to confine him&s;elf
within the limits of civility towards &s;ubjects who had tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ed
all bounds of regard, and even of good manners, in
their treatment of their &s;overeign.</P>
<P>THE first in&s;tance of tho&s;e parliamentary encroachments
which Charles was now to look for, was, the bill for pre&s;&s;|ing
&s;oldiers to the &s;ervice of Ireland. This bill quickly
pa&s;&s;ed the lower hou&s;e. In the preamble, the King's power
of pre&s;&s;ing, a power exerci&s;ed during all former times, was
declared illegal, and contrary to the liberty of the &s;ubject.
By a nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equence, the prerogative which
the crown had ever a&s;&s;umed, of obliging men to accept of any
branch of public &s;ervice, was aboli&s;hed and annihilated:
A prerogative, it mu&s;t be owned, not very compatible with
a limited monarchy. In order to elude this law, the King
offered to rai&s;e 10,000 volunteers for the Iri&s;h &s;ervice: But
the commons were afraid left &s;uch an army would be too
much at his di&s;po&s;al. Charles, &s;till unwilling to &s;ubmit to
&s;o con&s;iderable a diminution of power, came to the hou&s;e
of peers, and offered to pa&s;s the law without the preamble;
by which means, he &s;aid, that ill-timed question with re|gard
to the prerogative would for the pre&s;ent be avoided,
and the pretensions of each party be left intire. Both
hou&s;es took fire at this precipitant mea&s;ure, which, from a
&s;imilar in&s;tance, while the bill of attainder against Stra&s;|ford
was in dependence, Charles might fore&s;ee, would be
received with re&s;entment. The lords, as well as commons,
pa&s;&s;ed a vote, declaring it to be a high breach of privilege
for the King to take notice of any bill which was in agita|tion
<PB N="394" REF="454">
in either of the hou&s;es, or to expre&s;s his &s;entiments
with regard to it, before it be pre&s;ented to him for his
a&s;&s;ent in a parliamentary manner. The King was obliged
to compo&s;e all matters by an apology.<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Ru&s;hworth, vol. v. p. 458. &amp;c. Clarendon, vol. ii. p. 327 Nal&s;on, vol. ii. 738, 750, &amp;c</NOTE></P>
<P>THE general que&s;tion, we may ob&s;erve, with regard to
privileges of parliament, has always been, and &s;till conti|nues,
one of the greate&s;t my&s;teries of the English con&s;titu|tion;
and, in &s;ome re&s;pects, notwith&s;tanding the accurate
genius of that government, the&s;e privileges are at pre&s;ent
as undetermined as were formerly the prerogatives of the
crown. Such privileges as are founded on long precedent
cannot be controverted: But tho' it were certain, that for|mer
kings had not in any in&s;tance taken notice of bills lying
before the hou&s;es (which yet appears to have been very
u&s;ual); it follows not, merely from their never exerting
&s;uch a power, that they had renounced it, or never were
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of it. Such privileges al&s;o as are e&s;&s;ential to all
free a&s;&s;emblies which deliberate, they may be allowed to
a&s;&s;ume, whatever precedents may prevail: But though the
King's interpo&s;ition, by an offer or advice, does in &s;ome de|gree
over-awe or re&s;train liberty; it may be doubted, whe|ther
it impo&s;es &s;uch evident violence as to intitle the parlia|ment,
without any other authority or conce&s;&s;ion, to claim
the privilege of excluding it. But this was the &s;avourable
time for extending privileges; and had none more exorbit|ant
or unrea&s;onable been challenged, few bad con&s;equences
had followed. The e&s;tabli&s;hment of this rule, it is cer|tain,
contributes to the order and regularity, as well as free|dom,
of parliamentary proceedings.</P>
<P>THE interpo&s;ition of peers in the election of commoners
was likewi&s;e about this time declared a breach of privilege;
and continues ever &s;ince to be condemned by votes of the
<PB N="395" REF="455">
commons, and univer&s;ally practi&s;ed throughout the na|tion.</P>
<P>ENERY mea&s;ure pur&s;ued by the commons, and, &s;till more,
every attempt made by their partizans, was full of the mo&s;t
inveterate hatred again&s;t the hierarchy, and &s;howed a deter|mined
re&s;olution of &s;ubverting the whole eccle&s;ia&s;tical e&s;la|bli&s;hment.
Be&s;ides numberle&s;s vexations and per&s;ecutions
which the clergy underwent from the arbitrary power of
the lower hou&s;e; the peers, while the King was in Scot|land,
having pa&s;&s;ed an order for the ob&s;ervance of the laws
with regard to public wor&s;hip, the commons a&s;&s;umed &s;uch
authority, that, by a vote alone of their hou&s;e, they full|pended
tho&s;e laws, though enacted by the whole legi&s;la|ture:
And they particularly forbade bowing at the name of
JESUS; a practice which gave them the highe&s;t &s;candal,

Their bill for taking. away the bi&s;hops votes had la&s;t winter
been rejected by the peers: But they again introduced the
&s;ame bill, though no prorogation had intervened; and they
endeavoured, by &s;ome minute alterations, to elude that rule
of parliament which oppo&s;ed, them. And when they &s;ent
up this bill to the lords, they made a demand, the moll ab|&s;urd
in the world, that the bi&s;hops, being all of them par|ties,
<PB N="396" REF="456">
&s;hould be refu&s;ed a vote with regard to that que&s;tion<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Clarendon, vol. ii. p. 304.</NOTE>.
After the re&s;olution was once formed by the commons, of
invading the e&s;tabli&s;hed government of church and &s;tate, it
could not be expected that their proceedings, in &s;uch a vio|lent
attempt, would thenceforth be altogether regular and
equitable: But it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, that, in their attacks
on the hierarchy, they &s;till more openly tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed all
bounds of moderation; as &s;uppo&s;ing, no doubt, that the
&s;acredne&s;s of the cau&s;e would &s;ufficiently atone for employ|ing
means the mo&s;t irregular and unprecedented. This
principle, which prevails &s;o much among zealots, never
di&s;played it&s;elf &s;o openly as during the tran&s;actions of this
whole period.</P>
<P>BUT, notwith&s;tanding all the&s;e efforts of the commons,
they could not expect the concurrence of the upper hou&s;e,
either to this law, or to any other which they &s;hould introduce
for the farther limitation of royal authority. The
majority of the peers adhered to the King, and plainly fore|&s;aw
the depre&s;&s;ion of nobility, as a nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equence of
popular u&s;urpations on the crown. The in&s;olence, indeed,
of the commons, and their haughty treatment of the lords,
had already ri&s;en to a great height, and gave &s;ufficient
warning of their future attempts upon that order. They
muttered &s;omewhat of their regret, that they &s;hould be en|forced
to &s;ave the kingdom alone, and that the hou&s;e of
peers would have no part in the honour. Nay, they went
&s;o far as openly to tell the lords, &startq;That they them&s;elves
were the repre&s;entative body of the whole kingdom,
and that the peers were nothing but individuals, who
held their &s;ears in a particular capacity: And therefore,
if their lerd&s;hips will not con&s;ent to the pa&s;s;ing acts &startq;ne|ce&s;&s;ary

&s;pirit diffu&s;ed throughout the nation, that a total
confu&s;ion of all ranks and orders was ju&s;tly to be appre|hended;
and the wonder was not, that the majority of the
nobles &s;hould &s;eek &s;helter under the throne, but that any of
them &s;hould venture to de&s;ert it. But the tide of popu|larity
&s;eized many, and carried them wide of all the mo&s;t esta|bli&s;hed
maxims of civil policy. Among the opponents of the
King are ranked the Earl of Northumberland, lord admiral,
a man of the fir&s;t family and fortune, and endowed with
that dignified pride which &s;o well became his rank and &s;ta|tion:
The Earl of E&s;&s;ex, who inherited all his father's po|pularity,
and having, from his early youth, fought renown
in arms, united to a middling capacity that rigid inflexibility
of honour which forms the proper ornament of a nobleman
and a &s;oldier: The Lord Kimbolton, &s;oon after Earl of
Manche&s;ter, a per&s;on di&s;tingui&s;hed by humanity, genero&s;ity,
affability, and every amiable virtue. The&s;e men, finding
that their credit ran very high with the nation, ventured to
encourage tho&s;e popular di&s;orders, which, they vainly ima|gined,
they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed authority &s;ufficient to regulate and con|troul.</P>
<P>IN order to maintain a majority in the upper hou&s;e, the
commons had recour&s;e to the populace, who, on other oc|ca&s;ions,
had done them &s;uch important &s;ervices. Amid&s;t
the greate&s;t &s;ecurity, they affected continual fears of de&s;truc|tion
to them&s;elves and the nation, and &s;eemed to quake at
every breath or rumour of danger. They again excited
the people by never-cea&s;ing inquiries after con&s;piracies, by
reports of in&s;urrections, by feigned intelligence of inva&s;ions
from abroad, by di&s;coveries of dangerous combinations at

to be brought into the hair where they a&s;&s;embled, and
thus armed them&s;elves again&s;t tho&s;e con&s;piracies with which
they pretended they were hourly threatened. All &s;tories of
plots, however ridiculous, were willingly attended to, and
were di&s;per&s;ed among the multitude, to who&s;e capacity they
were well adapted. Beale, a taylor, informed the com|mons,
that, walking in the fields, he had hearkened to the
di&s;cour&s;e of certain per&s;ons, unknown to him, and had
heard them talk of a mo&s;t dangerous con&s;piracy. A hundred
and eight ruffians, as he learned, had been appointed to
murder a hundred and eight lords and commoners, and were
promi&s;ed rewards for the&s;e a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inations, ten pounds for
each lord, forty &s;hillings for each commoner. Upon this
notable intelligence, orders were i&s;&s;ued for &s;eizing prie&s;ts
and je&s;uits, a conference was de&s;ired with the lords, and the
deputy-lieutenants of &s;ome &s;u&s;pected counties were ordered

<P>THE pulpits likewi&s;e were called in aid, and re&s;ounded
With the dangers which threatened religion, from the de|&s;perate
attempts of papi&s;ts and malignants. Multitudes of
people flocked owards We&s;tmin&s;ter, and in&s;ulted the pre|lates
and &s;uch of the lords as adhered to the crown. The
peers voted a declaration again&s;t tho&s;e tumults, and sent it
to the other hou&s;e; but the&s;e refu&s;ed their concurrence<NOTE PLACE="foot">&Dagger;Ru&s;h. part III. vol. i. p. 710.</NOTE>.
Some &s;editious apprentices, being &s;eized and committed to

di&s;charge the watches, convened the ju&s;tices, voted their

the populace crouded about Whitehall, and threw out
in&s;olent menaces again&s;t the King him&s;elf. Several reduced
officers and young gentlemen of the inns of court, during
this time of di&s;order and danger, offered then &s;ervice to his

way of reproach, the&s;e gentlemen gave the rabble the ap|pellation

And thus the nation, which was before &s;ufficiently provided

The former e&s;pecially, being; ea&s;ily di&s;tingui&s;hable by their

Williams, now Created archbi&s;hop of York, having been
abu&s;ed by the populace, ha&s;tily called a meeting of his bre|thren.
By his advice, a prote&s;tation was drawn and ad|der&s;&s;ed
to the King and the hou&s;e of lords. The bi&s;hops
there &s;et forth, that, tho' they had an undoubted right to
fit and vote in parliament, yet, in coming thither, they had
been menaced, a&s;&s;aulted, affronted, by the unruly multi|tude,
and could no longer with &s;afety attend their duty in

This prote&s;tation, which, though ju&s;t and legal, was cer|tainly
very ill-timed, was &s;igned by twelve bi&s;hops, and
communicated to the King, who ha&s;tily approved of it.
As &s;oon as it was pre&s;ented to the lords, that hou&s;e de&s;ired
a conference with the commons, whom they informed of
this unexpected prote&s;tation. The opportunity was &s;eized
with joy and triumph. An impeachment of high trea&s;on
was immediately &s;ent up again&s;t the bi&s;hops, as endeavour|ing
to &s;ubvert the fundamental laws, and to invalidate the
authority of the legi&s;lature<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Whitlocke, p. 51. Ru&s;hworth, vol. v. p. 466. Nal&s;on, vol. ii. p. 794.</NOTE>. They were, on the fir&s;t de|mand,
&s;eque&s;tred from parliament, and committed to cu&s;|tody.
No man, in either hou&s;e, ventured to &s;peak a word

the egregious imprudence of which they had been guilty.

of high trea&s;on; but that they were &s;tark mad, and there|fore
de&s;ired they might be &s;ent to bedlam<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Clarendon, vol. ii. p. 355.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>A FEW days afterwards,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1624.</NOTE> the King was guilty of another
indi&s;cretion, much more fatal: An indi&s;cretion, to which all
the en&s;uing di&s;orders and civil wars ought, immediately and
directly, to be a&s;cribed. This was the impeachment of
Lord Kimbolton and the five members.</P>
<P>WHEN the commons employed, in their remon&s;trance,
language &s;o &s;evere and indecent, they had not been actuated
intirely by in&s;olence and pa&s;&s;ion: Their views were much
more &s;olid and profound. They con&s;idered, That, in a
violent attempt, &s;uch as an inva&s;ion of the antient con&s;titu|tion,
the more lei&s;ure was afforded the people to reflect, the
le&s;s would they be inclined to &s;econd that ra&s;h and danger|ous,
enterprize; that the peers would certainly refu&s;e their
<PB N="401" REF="465">
concurrence,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1642.</NOTE> nor were there any hopes of prevailing on them
but by exciting the populace to tumult and di&s;order; that
the employing &s;uch odious means for &s;o invidious an end
would, at long-run, lo&s;e them all their popularity, and turn
the tide of favour to the contrary party; and that, if the
King only remained in tranquillity, and cautiou&s;ly eluded
the fir&s;t violence of the tempe&s;t, he would, in the end,
certainly prevail, and be able at lea&s;t to pre&s;erve intire the
antient laws and con&s;titution. They were therefore re&s;olved,
if po&s;&s;ible, to excite him to &s;ome violent pa&s;&s;ion; in hopes
that he would commit indi&s;cretions, of which they might
make advantage.</P>
<P>IT was not long before they &s;ucceeded beyond their fonde&s;t
wi&s;hes. Charles, enraged to find that all his conce&s;&s;ions
but increa&s;ed their demands; that the people, who were
returning to a &s;en&s;e of duty towards him, were again rou&s;ed
to &s;edition and tumults; that the blacke&s;t calumnies were
propagated again&s;t him, and even the Iri&s;h ma&s;&s;acre a&s;cribed
to his coun&s;els and machinations; that a method of adder&s;s
was adopted, not only un&s;uitable towards &s;o great a prince,
but which no private gentleman could bear without re&s;ent|ment:
When he con&s;idered all the&s;e increa&s;ing in&s;olences
in the commons, he was apt to a&s;cribe them, in a great
mea&s;ure, to his own indolence and facility. The Queen and
the ladies of the court farther &s;timulated his pa&s;&s;ion, and re|pre&s;ented,
that, if he exerted the vigour, and di&s;played
the maje&s;ty of a monarch, the daring u&s;urpations of his
&s;ubjects would &s;hrink before him. Lord Digby, a man of
fine parts, but full of levity, and hurried on by precipitant
pa&s;&s;ions, &s;ugge&s;ted like coun&s;els; and Charles, who, tho'
commonly moderate in his temper, was ever di&s;po&s;ed to

they were accu&s;ed, than &s;o far as they concurred with the
majority in their votes and &s;peeches. Tho' proofs might,
perhaps, be produced, of their privately inviting the Scots
to invade England; how could &s;uch an attempt be con&s;i|dered
as trea&s;on, after the act of oblivion which had pa&s;&s;ed,

and after that both hou&s;es, with the King's concurrence,
had voted that nation three hundred thou&s;and pounds for
their brotherly a&s;&s;i&s;tance? While the hou&s;e of peers are
&s;carce able to maintain their independency, or reject the
bills &s;ent them by the commons; will they ever be permitted
by the populace, &s;uppo&s;ing them inclined, to pa&s;s a &s;en|tence
which mu&s;t totally &s;ubdue the lower hou&s;e, and put
an end to their ambitious undertakings? The&s;e five mem|bers,
at lea&s;t Pym, Hambden, and Hollis, are the very
heads of the popular party; and if the&s;e be taken off, what
fate mu&s;t be expected by their followers, who are many of
them accomplices in the &s;ame trea&s;on? The puni&s;hment of
leaders is ever the la&s;t triumph over a broken and routed
party; but &s;urely was never before attempted, in oppo&s;ition
to a faction, during the full tide of its power and &s;uc|ce&s;s.</P>
<P>BUT men had not lei&s;ure to wonder at the extreme indi&s;|cretion
of this mea&s;ure: Their a&s;toni&s;hment was excited
by new attempts, &s;till more precipitant and imprudent. A
&s;erjeant at arms, in the King's name, demanded of the
hou&s;e the five members; and was &s;ent back without any
po&s;itive an&s;wer. Me&s;&s;engers were employed to &s;earch for
them, and arre&s;t them. Their trunks, chambers, and &s;tu|dies,
were &s;ealed, and locked. The hou&s;e voted all the&s;e
violences to be a breach of privilege, and commanded every
one to defend the liberty of the members<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Whitlocke, p. 50. Ru&s;hworth, vol. v. p. 474, 475.</NOTE>. The King,
irritated by all this oppo&s;ition, re&s;olved next day to come
in per&s;on to the hou&s;e, with an intention to demand, perhaps
&s;eize in their pre&s;ence, the per&s;ons whom he had accu&s;ed.</P>
<P>THIS &s;trange re&s;olution was di&s;covered to the Counte&s;s

before the King entered. He was accompanied with his or|dinary
retinue to the number of above two hundred, armed
as u&s;ual, &s;ome with halberts, &s;ome with walking &s;words.
The King left them at the door, and he him&s;elf advanced
alone thro' the hall; while all the members &s;tood up to re|ceive
him. The &s;peaker withdrew from his chair, and the
King took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it. The &s;peech which he made
was as follows; &startq;Gentlemen, I am &s;orry for this occa&s;ion
of coming to you. Ye&s;terday, I &s;ent a &s;erjeant at arms
to demand &s;ome, who, by my order, were accu&s;ed of

I mu&s;t here declare to you, that, though no King, that
ever was in England, could be more careful of your pri|vileges
than I &s;hall be, yet in ca&s;es of trea&s;on no per&s;on
has privilege. Therefore, am I come to tell you, that
I mu&s;t have the&s;e men where&s;oever I can find them.

you will &s;end them to me as &s;oon as they return. But I
a&s;&s;ure you, on the word of a king, I never did intend
any force, but &s;hall proceed again&s;t them in a fair and
legal way: For I never meant any other. And now &s;ince
I &s;ee I cannot do what I came for, I think this no unfit

I have done in favour and to the good of my &s;ub|jects,

WHEN the hou&s;e of commons met, they affected the
greate&s;t di&s;may and terror; and, adjourning them&s;elves for
&s;ome days, ordered a committee to &s;it in merchant-taylors
hall in the city. The committee made an exact inquiry
into each circum&s;trance attending the King's entry into
the hou&s;e: Every pa&s;&s;ionate &s;peech, every menacing ge&s;ture of
any, even the meane&s;t, of his attendants, was recorded and
aggravated. An intention of offering violence to the par|liament,
of &s;eizing the accu&s;ed members in the very hou&s;e,
and of murdering all who &s;hould make re&s;i&s;tance, was in|ferred.
And that unparalleled breach of privilege, for &s;o
it was called, was &s;till a&s;cribed to the coun&s;els of papi&s;ts
and their adherents. This expre&s;&s;ion, which recurs every
moment in &s;peeches and memorials, and which, at pre&s;ent,
is &s;o apt to excite laughter in the reader, begot at that time
the deepe&s;t and mo&s;t real confirmation throughout the
Kingdom.</P>
<P>A LETTER was pretended to be intercepted, and was
communicated to the committee, who pretended to lay
great weight upon it. One catholic there congratulates an|other
on the accu&s;ation of the members; and repre&s;ents
that event as a branch of the &s;ame pious contrivance which
had excited the Iri&s;h in&s;urrection, and by which the pro|fane
heretics would &s;oon be extirpated in England<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Nal&s;on, vol. ii. p. 836.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE hou&s;e met; and, after confirming the votes of
their committee, in&s;tantly adjourned, as if expo&s;ed to the
mo&s;t imminent perils from the violence of their enemies.
This practice they continued for &s;ome time. When the
people, by the&s;e affected panics, were wrought up to a
&s;ufficient degree of rage and terror, it was thought proper,
that the accu&s;ed members &s;hould, with a triumphant and
military proce&s;&s;ion, take their &s;eats in the hou&s;e. The
Thames was covered with boats, and other ve&s;&s;els, laden
with &s;mall pieces of ordnance, and prepared for fight.

Skippon, whom the parliament had appointed, by their own
authority, major-general of the city-militia<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Nal&s;on, vol. ii. p. 833.</NOTE>, conducted the

<P>THE King,<NOTE PLACE="marg">King leaves London.</NOTE> apprehen&s;ive of danger from the enraged
multitude, had retired to Hampton-court, de&s;erted by all
the world, and overwhelmed with grief, &s;hame, and re|mor&s;e;
for the fatal mea&s;ures into which he had been hur|ried.
His deplorable &s;ituation he could no longer a&s;cribe
to the rigors of de&s;tiny, or the malignity of enemies: His
own precipitancy and indi&s;cretion mu&s;t bear the blame of
whatever di&s;a&s;ters &s;hould henceforth befal him. The mo&s;t
faithful of his adherents, between &s;orrow and indignation,
were confounded with reflections on what had happened,
and what was likely to follow. Seeing every pro&s;pect
bla&s;ted, faction triumphant, the di&s;contented populace en|flamed
to a degree of fury, they utterly de&s;paired of &s;ucce&s;s,
in a cau&s;e, to who&s;e ruin, friends and enemies &s;eemed
equally to con&s;pire.</P>
<P>THE prudence of the King, in his conduct of this af|fair,
nobody pretended to ju&s;tify. The legality of his pro|ceedings
met with many and ju&s;t apologies; tho' generally
offered to unwilling ears. No maxim of law, it was &s;aid,
is more e&s;tabli&s;hed, or more univer&s;ally allowed, than that
privileges of parliament extend not to trea&s;on, felony, or
breach of peace; nor has either hou&s;e, during former
ages, ever pretended, in any of tho&s;e ca&s;es, to interpo&s;e in
behalf of its members. Tho' &s;ome inconveniences &s;hould
re&s;ult from the ob&s;ervance of this maxim; that would not
be &s;ufficient, without other authority, to aboli&s;h a principle
<PB N="408" REF="472">
e&s;tabli&s;hed by uninterrupted precedent, and founded on the
tacit con&s;ent of the whole legi&s;lature. But what are the
inconveniences &s;o much dreaded? The King, on pretence of
trea&s;on, may &s;eize any members of the oppo&s;ite faction,
and, for a time, gain to his partizans the majority of voices.
But if he &s;eize only a few; will he not lo&s;e more friends, by
&s;uch a gro&s;s artifice, than he confines enemies? If he &s;eize a
great number; is not this expedient force, open and bare|faced?
And what remedy, in all times, again&s;t &s;uch force,
but to oppo&s;e to it a force which is &s;uperior? Even allow|ing
that the King intended to employ violence, not autho|rity,
for &s;eizing the members; though at that time, and
ever afterwards, he po&s;itively a&s;&s;erted the contrary; yet
will his conduct admit of excu&s;e. That the hall, where,
the parliament a&s;&s;embles, is an inviolable &s;anctuary, was
never yet pretended. And if the commons complain of the
affront offered them, by an attempt to arre&s;t their members
in their very pre&s;ence; they ought only to blame them&s;elves,
who had formerly refu&s;ed compliance with the King's me&s;|&s;age,
when he peaceably demanded the&s;e members. The
&s;overeign is the great executor of the laws; and his pre&s;ence
was here legally employed, both in order to prevent oppo|&s;ition,
and to protect the hou&s;e again&s;t tho&s;e in&s;ults which
their di&s;obedience had &s;o well merited<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">&startq;In a parliament of Queen Elizabeth, when Sir Edward Coke was &s;peaker, the Queen &s;ent a me&s;&s;enger or &s;erjeant at arms into the hou&s;e of commons, and took out Mr. Morrice, and committed him to pri&s;on with divers others, for &s;ome &s;peeches &s;poken in the hou&s;e.

CHARLES knew to how little purpo&s;e he &s;hould urge
the&s;e rea&s;ons again&s;t the pre&s;ent fury of the commons.
He propo&s;ed, therefore, by a me&s;&s;age, that they would agree
upon a legal method, by which he might carry on his pro|&s;ecution
again&s;t the members, le&s;t farther mi&s;under&s;tand|ings

to lay the grounds of accu&s;ation before the hou&s;e; and pre|tended,
that they mu&s;t fir&s;t judge whether it were proper
to abandon their members to a legal trial. The King then
informed them, that he would wave, for the pre&s;ent, all
ro&s;ecution: By &s;ucce&s;&s;ive me&s;&s;ages, he afterwards offered
a pardon to the members; offered to concur in any law that
&s;hould acquit or &s;ecure them; offered any reparation to
the hou&s;e for the breach of privilege, of which, he ac|knowleged,
they had rea&s;on to complain<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Dugdale, p. 84. Ru&s;h. vol. v. p. 484, 488, 492, &amp;c.</NOTE>. They were re|&s;olved
to accept of no &s;atisfaction, unle&s;s he would di&s;cover
his advi&s;ers in that illegal mea&s;ure: A condition, to which
they knew that, without rendering him&s;elf for ever vile and
contemptible, he could not po&s;&s;ibly &s;ubmit. Mean while,
they continued to thunder again&s;t the violation of parlia|mentary
privileges, and, by their violent outcries, to in|flame
the whole nation. The &s;ecret rea&s;on of their di&s;|plea&s;ure,
however obvious, they carefully concealed. In
the King's accu&s;ation of the members, they plainly &s;aw his
judgment of late parliamentary proceedings; and every
member of the ruling faction dreaded the &s;ame fate, &s;hould
royal authority be re-e&s;tabli&s;hed in its antient lu&s;tre. By
the mo&s;t unhappy conduct, Charles, while he extremely
augmented, in his opponents, the will, had al&s;o increa&s;ed
the ability, of hurting him.</P>
<P>IN order farther to excite the people, who&s;e di&s;po&s;itions
were already very &s;editious, the expedient of petitioning
was renewed. A petition from the county of Buckingham
was pre&s;ented by &s;ix thou&s;and men, who promi&s;ed to live
<PB N="410" REF="474">
and die in defence of the privileges of parliament<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Ru&s;hworth, vol. v. p. 487.</NOTE>. The
city of London, the county of E&s;&s;ex, that of Hertford,
Surrey, Berks, imitated this example. A petition from the
apprentices was graciou&s;ly received<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Idem ibid. p. 462.</NOTE>. Nay, one
was encou|raged from the porters; who&s;e numbers amounted, as they
&s;aid, to fifteen thou&s;and<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Dugdale, p. 87.</NOTE>. The addre&s;s of that great body
contained the &s;ame articles with all the others; the privileges
of parliament, the danger of religion, the rebellion of Ire|land,
the decay of trade. The porters further de&s;ired,
that ju&s;tice might be done upon offenders, as the atrociou&s;|ne&s;s
of their crimes had de&s;erved. And they added, <HI>That
if &s;uch remedies were any longer &s;u&s;pended, they would be

&s;aying,</HI> &startq;That nece&s;&s;ity has no law<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Clarendon, vol. ii. p. 412.</NOTE>&endq;.</P>
<P>ANOTHER petition was pre&s;ented by &s;everal poor people,
in the name of many thou&s;ands more; in which the peti|tioners
propo&s;ed as a remedy for the public mi&s;eries, <HI>That
tho&s;e noble worthies of the hou&s;e of peers, who concur with
the happy votes of the commons, may &s;parate them&s;elves
from the re&s;t, and &s;it and vote as one intire body.</HI> The
commons gave thanks for this petition<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Idem ibid. p. 413.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE very women were &s;eized with the &s;ame rage. A
brewer's wife, followed by many thou&s;ands of her &s;ex,
brought a petition to the hou&s;e; in which the petitioners
expre&s;&s;ed their terror of the papi&s;ts and prelates, and their
dread of like ma&s;&s;acres, rapes, and outrages, with tho&s;e
which had been exerci&s;ed upon their &s;ex in Ireland. They
had been nece&s;&s;itated, they &s;aid, to imitate the example of
the woman of Tekoah: And they claimed equal right with
the men, of declaring, by petition, their &s;en&s;e of the pub|lic
cau&s;e; becau&s;e Chri&s;t had purcha&s;ed them at as dear a
rate, and in the free enjoyment of Chri&s;t con&s;i&s;ts equally
<PB N="411" REF="475">
the happine&s;s of both &s;exes. Pym came to the door of the
hou&s;e; and, having told the female zealots that their peti|tion
was thankfully accepted, and was pre&s;ented in a &s;ea|&s;onable
time, he begged that their prayers for the &s;ucce&s;s
of the commons might follow their petition. Such low
arts of popularity were affected! And by &s;uch illiberal cant
were the unhappy people incited to civil di&s;cord and con|vul&s;ions!</P>
<P>ALL petitions, in the mean time, which favoured the
church or monarchy, from whatever hand they came, not
only were di&s;couraged; but the petitioners were &s;ent for,
impri&s;oned, and pro&s;ecuted as delinquents: And this un|equal
conduct was openly avowed and ju&s;tified. Whoever
de&s;ire a change, it was &s;aid, mu&s;t expre&s;s their inclination;
for how, otherwi&s;e, &s;hall it be known? But tho&s;e who fa|vour

not petition; becau&s;e they already enjoy what they wi&s;h
for<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Clarendon, vol. ii. p. 449.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE King had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a very great party in the lower
hou&s;e, as appeared in the vote for the remon&s;trance; and
this party, had every new cau&s;e of di&s;gu&s;t been carefully
avoided, would &s;oon have become the majority; from the
odium attending the violent mea&s;ures employed by the po|pular
leaders. A great majority he always po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in the
hou&s;e of peers, even after the bi&s;hops were con&s;ined or
cha&s;ed away; and this majority could not have been over|come,
but by outrages, which, in the end, would have
drawn di&s;grace and ruin on tho&s;e who incited them. By
the pre&s;ent fury of the people, as by an inundation, were
all the&s;e ob&s;tacles &s;wept away, and every rampart of royal
authority laid level with the ground. The victory was
pur&s;ued with impetuo&s;ity by the &s;agacious commons, who
knew the importance of a favourable moment in all popular
commotions. The terror of their authority they extended
<PB N="412" REF="476">
over the whole nation; and all oppo&s;ition, and even all
blame vented in familiar di&s;cour&s;e, were treated as, the mo&s;t
atrocious crimes, by the&s;e &s;evere inqui&s;itors. Scarcely was
it permitted to find fault with the conduct of any particular
member, if he made a figure in the hou&s;e; and reflections,
thrown out on Pym, were at this time treated as breaches
of privilege. he populace without-doors were ready to
execute, from the lea&s;t hint, the will of their leaders; nor
was it &s;afe for any member to approach either hou&s;e, who
pretended to controul or oppo&s;e the general torrent. After
&s;o undi&s;gui&s;ed a manner was this violence conducted, that
Hollis, in a &s;peech to the peers, de&s;ired to know the names
of &s;uch members as &s;hould vote contrary to the &s;entiments
of the commons<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">King's Declar. of 12th of Augu&s;t 1642.</NOTE>: And Pym &s;aid in the lower hou&s;e, that

ju&s;t de&s;ires<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BY the flight, or terror, or de&s;pondency, of the King's
party, an undi&s;puted majority remained every-where to their
opponents; and the bills &s;ent up by the commons, which
had hitherto &s;topped with the peers, and would certainly
have been rejected, now pa&s;&s;ed, and were pre&s;ented for the
royal a&s;&s;ent. The&s;e were, the pre&s;&s;ing bill with its pre|amble,
and the bill again&s;t the bi&s;hops votes. The King's
authority was at that time reduced to the lowe&s;t ebb. The
Queen too, being &s;ecretly threatened with an impeachment,
and finding no re&s;ource in her hu&s;band's protection, was
preparing to retire into Holland. The rage of the people,
on account of her religion, as well as her &s;pirit and activity,
was univer&s;ally levelled again&s;t her. U&s;age, the mo&s;t igno|minious,
&s;he had hitherto borne with a &s;ilent indignation.
The commons, in their fury again&s;t prie&s;ts, had &s;eized her
very confe&s;&s;or; nor would they relea&s;e him upon her re|peated
applications. Even a vi&s;it of the prince to his mo|ther
had been openly complained of, and remon&s;trances
<PB N="413" REF="477">
again&s;t it had been pre&s;ented to her<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Nal&s;on, vol. ii. p. 512.</NOTE>. Apprehen&s;ive of
attacks &s;till more violent, &s;he was de&s;irous of facilitating her
e&s;cape; and &s;he prevailed with the King to pa&s;s the&s;e bills,
in hopes of appea&s;ing, for a time, the rage of the multi|tude<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Clarendon, vol. ii. p. 428.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THESE new conce&s;&s;ions, however important, the King
immediately found to have no other effect, than had all
the preceding ones: They were made the foundation of
demands &s;till more exorbitant. From the facility of his
dipo&s;ition, from the impotence of his &s;ituation, the com|mons
believed that he could now refu&s;e them nothing. And
they regarded the lea&s;t moment of relaxation, in their inva|&s;ion
of royal authority, as highly impolitic, during the un|interrupted
torrent of their &s;ucce&s;&s;es. The very moment
they were informed of the&s;e la&s;t acqui&s;itions, they affronted
the Queen, by opening &s;ome intercepted letters wrote to her
by Lord Digby: They carried up an impeachment again&s;t
Herbert, attorney-general, for obeying his ma&s;ter's com|mands
in accu&s;ing their members<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Ru&s;h. vol. v. p. 489. Clarendon, ut &s;upra, p. 385.</NOTE>. And they pro&s;ecuted
with &s;re&s;h vigour their plan of the militia, on which they
re&s;ted all future hopes of an uncontrouled authority.</P>
<P>THE commons were &s;en&s;ible, that monarchical govern|ment,
which, during &s;o many ages, had been e&s;tabli&s;hed in
England, would &s;oon regain &s;ome degree of its former dig|nity,
after the pre&s;ent tempe&s;t was overblown; nor would
all their new-invented limitations be able totally to &s;uppre&s;s

an&s;wer to their ju&s;t and nece&s;&s;ary petition. They repre|&s;ented,
that any delay, during dangers and di&s;tractions &s;o
great and pre&s;&s;ing, was not le&s;s un&s;atisfactory and de&s;truc|tive

their duty to &s;ee put in execution a mea&s;ure &s;o nece&s;&s;ary for
public &s;afety. And they affirmed, that the people in many
<PB N="416" REF="482">

places, were, of them&s;elves and by their own authority,
providing again&s;t tho&s;e urgent dangers with which they
were threatened<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Ru&s;hworth, vol. v. p. 521.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>EVEN after this in&s;olence, the King dur&s;t not venture
upon a flat denial. Be&s;ides excepting to the preamble,
which threw &s;uch di&s;honour upon him, and prote&s;ting the
innocence of his intentions, when he entered the hou&s;e of
commons; he only de&s;ired that the military authority, if it
was defective, &s;hould fir&s;t be conferred upon the crown;
and he promi&s;ed to be&s;tow commi&s;&s;ions, but &s;uch as &s;hould
be revokeable at plea&s;ure, on the very &s;ame per&s;ons whom
the parliament had named in the ordinance<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Idem ibid.</NOTE>. By a former
me&s;&s;age, he had expre&s;&s;ed his wi&s;hes that they would lay be|fore
him, in one view, all the demands which they deemed
requi&s;ite for the &s;ettlement of the nation. They pretended,
that they were expo&s;ed to perils &s;o dreadful and imminent,
that they had not lei&s;ure for &s;uch a work<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Idem ib. p. 516, 517.</NOTE>. The expedient
propo&s;ed by the King &s;eemed a &s;ufficient remedy during this

intire and unbroken.</P>
<P>BUT the intentions of the commons were very wide of
this purpo&s;e,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1&s;t March.</NOTE> and their panics could be cured by one re|medy
alone. They in&s;tantly replied, that the dangers and
di&s;tempers of the nation were &s;uch as could endure no longer
delay; and unle&s;s the King &s;peedily complied with their de|mands,
they &s;hould be inforced, for the &s;afety of the King

a&s;&s;erted, that tho&s;e parts of the kingdom, which have, from
their own authority, put them&s;elves in a po&s;ture of defence
during the&s;e prevailing jealou&s;ies and fears, had acted &s;uit|able
to the declarations and directions of both hou&s;es, and
<PB N="417" REF="483">
conformable to the laws of the kingdom. And while they
thus menaced the King with their power, they invited him

the intelligence was conveyed to London; and it was imme|diately

<P>THAT the &s;ame violence, by which he had &s;o long been

Prince of Wales and the Duke of York along with him,
he arrived, by &s;low journies, at York, which he was deter|mined
for &s;ome time to make the place of his re&s;idence.
The di&s;tant parts of the kingdom, being removed from that
furious vortex of new principles and opinions which had
tran&s;ported the capital, &s;till retained a &s;incere regard for the
church and monarchy; and the King here found marks of
attachment beyond what he had before expected<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Warwick, p. 208.</NOTE>. From
all quarters of England, the prime nobility and gentry, ei|ther
per&s;onally or by me&s;&s;ages and letters, expre&s;&s;ed their
duty towards him; and exhorted him to &s;ave him&s;elf and
them from that ignominious &s;lavery with which they were
threatened. The &s;mall interval of time, which had pa&s;&s;ed
&s;ince the fatal accu&s;ation of the members, had been &s;uffi|cient
to open the eyes of many, and to recover them from
the a&s;toni&s;hment with which at fir&s;t they had been &s;eized.
One ra&s;h and pa&s;&s;ionate attempt of the King &s;eemed but a
&s;mall counterbalance to &s;o many acts of deliberate violence
which had been offered to him, and every other branch of
the legi&s;lature: And, however &s;weet the &s;ound of liberty
many resolved to adhere to that moderate freedom tran&s;|mitted
them from their ance&s;tors, and now better &s;ecured by
&s;uch important conce&s;&s;ions; rather than, by engaging in a
giddy &s;earch after greater independence, run a manife&s;t|ri&s;que,
either of incurring a cruel &s;ubjection, or abandon|ing
all law and order.</P>
<P>CHARLES, finding him&s;elf &s;upported by a con&s;iderable
party in the kingdom, began to &s;peak in a firmer tone, and
to retort the accu&s;ations of the commons with a vigour which
he had never before exerted. Notwith&s;tanding all their
remon&s;trances, and menaces, and in&s;ults, he &s;till per&s;i&s;ted
is refu&s;ing the militia ordinance; and they proceeded to
frame a new ordinance, in which, by the authority of the
<PB N="420" REF="488">
two hou&s;es, without the King's con&s;ent, they named lieu|tenants
for all the counties, and conferred on them the com|mand
of the whole military force, of all the guards, garri|&s;ons,
and forts of the kingdom. He i&s;&s;ued proclamations
again&s;t this manife&s;t u&s;urpation; and, as he profe&s;&s;ed a re|&s;olution
&s;trictly to ob&s;erve the law him&s;elf, &s;o was he deter|mined,
he &s;aid, to oblige every other per&s;on to pay it a
like obedience. The name of the King was &s;o e&s;&s;ential to
all laws, and &s;o familiar in all acts of executive authority,
that the parliament were afraid, had they totally omitted
it, that the innovation would be too &s;en&s;ible to the people.
In all commands, therefore, which they conferred, they
bound the per&s;ons to obey the orders of his Maje&s;ty, &s;igni|fied
by both hou&s;es of parliament. And, inventing a di&s;|tinction,
hitherto unheard of, between the office and the
per&s;on of the King; tho&s;e very forces, which they em|ployed
again&s;t him, they levied in his name and by his au|thorityt<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Ru&s;h. vol. v. p. 526.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IT is remarkable how much the topics of argument were
now rever&s;ed between the parties. The King, while he
acknowleged his former error, of employing a plea of nece&s;|&s;ity,
in order to infringe the laws and con&s;titution, warned
the parliament not to imitate an example on which they threw
&s;uch violent blame; and the parliament, while they cloathed
their per&s;onal fears or ambition under the appearance of
national and imminent danger, made unknowingly an apo|logy
for the mo&s;t exceptionable part of the King's conduct.
That the liberties of the people were no longer expo&s;ed to
any peril from royal authority, &s;o narrowly circum&s;cribed,
&s;o exactly defined, &s;o un&s;upported by revenue and by mili|tary
power, might be maintained upon very plau&s;ible to|pics:
But that the danger, allowing it to have any existence,
was not of that kind; great, urgent, inevitable; which
di&s;&s;olves all laws and levels all limitations, &s;eems apparent
<PB N="421" REF="489">
from the &s;imple&s;t view of the&s;e tran&s;actions. So obvious
indeed was the King's pre&s;ent inability to invade the con&s;ti|tution,
that the fears and jealou&s;ies, which operated on the
people, and pu&s;hed them &s;o furiou&s;ly to arms, were un|doubtedly
not of a civil, but of a religious nature. The
di&s;tempered imaginations of men were agitated with a con|tinual
dread of popery, with a horror for prelacy, with an
antipathy to ceremonies and the liturgy, and with a violent
affection for whatever was mo&s;t oppo&s;ite to the&s;e objects of
aver&s;ion. The fanatical &s;pirit, let loo&s;e, confounded all
regards to ea&s;e, &s;afety; intere&s;t; and di&s;&s;olved every moral
and civil obligation<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">The great courage and conduct, di&s;played by many of the popular lead|er&s;, have commonly inclined men to do them, in one re&s;pect, more honour than they de&s;erve, and to &s;uppo&s;e, that, like able politicians, they employed pretences which they &s;ecretly de&s;pi&s;ed, in order to &s;erve their &s;elfi&s;h purpo&s;es. It is, however, probable, if not certain, that they were, generally &s;peaking, the dupes of their own zeal. Hypocri&s;y, quite pure and free from fanatici&s;m, is perhaps as rare as fanatici&s;m intirely purged from all mixture of hypocri&s;y. So congenial to the human mind are religious &s;entiments, that it is impo&s;&s;ible to counterfeit long the&s;e holy &s;ervors, without feeling &s;ome &s;hare of the a&s;|&s;umed warmth: And, on the other hand, &s;o precarious and temporary, from the frailty of human nature, is the operation of the&s;e &s;piritual views, that the religious ec&s;ta&s;ies, if con&s;tantly employed, mu&s;t often be counterfeit, and mu&s;t be warped by tho&s;e more familiar motives of intere&s;t and ambition, which in&s;en&s;ibly gain upon the mind. This indeed &s;eems the key to mo&s;t of the celebrated characters of that age. Equally full of fraud and of ardour, the&s;e pious patriots talked perpetually of-&s;eeking the Lord, yet &s;till pur&s;ued their own purpo&s;es; and have left a memorable le&s;&s;on to po&s;terity, how delu|&s;ive, how de&s;tructive, that principle is by which they were animated.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>EACH party was now willing to throw on its antagoni&s;t
the odium of commencing a civil war; but both of them,
prepared for an event which they deemed inevitable. To
gain the people's favour and good opinion was the chief
point on both &s;ides. Never was there a people le&s;s cor|rupted
by vice, and more actuated by principle, than the
Engli&s;h during that period: Never were there individuals
who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed more capacity, more courage, more public
&s;pirit, more di&s;intere&s;ted zeal. The infu&s;ion of one ingre|dient
<PB N="422" REF="490">
in too large a proportion had corrupted all the&s;e noble
principles, and converted them into the mo&s;t virulent poi|&s;on.
To determine his choice in the approaching contests,
every man hearkened with avidity to the rea&s;ons propo&s;ed on
both &s;ides. The war of the pen preceded that of the &s;word,
and daily sharpened the humours of the oppo&s;ite parties.
Be&s;ides private adventurers without number, he King and
parliament them&s;elves carried on the controver&s;y, by me&s;|&s;ages,
remon&s;trances, and declarations, where the nation
was really the party to whom all arguments were addre&s;&s;ed.
Charles had here a double advantage. Not only his cau&s;e
was more favourable, as &s;upporting the antient government
of church and &s;tate again&s;t the mo&s;t illegal preten&s;ions: It
was al&s;o defended with more art and eloquence. Lord
Falkland had accepted the office of &s;ecretary; a man who
adorned the pure&s;t virtue with the riche&s;t gifts of nature,
with the mo&s;t valuable acqui&s;itions of learning. By him,
a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the King him&s;elf, were the memorials of the royal
party chiefly compo&s;ed. So &s;en&s;ible was Charles of his &s;u|periority
in this particular, that he took care to di&s;per&s;e
every-where the papers of the parliament together with his
own, that the people might be the more enabled, by com|pari&s;on,
to form a judgment between them: The parlia|ment,
while they di&s;tributed copies of their own, were
anxious to &s;uppre&s;s all the King's compo&s;itions<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Ru&s;hworth, vol. v. p. 751.</NOTE>.</P>

to demon&s;trate his intire confidence in his people, and his

which had been made him, and the enormous en|croachments,
in&s;ults, and indignities, to which he had been
expo&s;ed; the&s;e were the topics, which, with &s;o much ju&s;t|ne&s;s
<PB N="423" REF="491">
of rea&s;oning and propriety of expre&s;&s;ion, were in&s;i&s;ted
on in the King's declarations and remonstrances<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">In &s;ome of the&s;e declarations, &s;uppo&s;ed to be penned by Lord Falkland, is found the fir&s;t, regular definition of the con&s;titution, according to our pre|&s;ent ideas of it, that occurs in any Engli&s;h compo&s;ition; at lea&s;t any publi&s;hed by authority. The three &s;pecies of government, monarchical, ari&s;tocratical, and democratical, are there plainly di&s;tingui&s;hed, and the Engli&s;h government is expre&s;ly &s;aid to be none of them pure, but all of them mixed and tempered together. This &s;tile, tho' the &s;en&s;e of it was implied in many in|&s;titutions, no former king of England would have u&s;ed; and no &s;ubject would have been permitted to u&s;e. Banks and the crown-lawyers again&s;t Hambden, in the ca&s;e of &s;hip-money, in&s;i&s;t plainly and openly on the king's ab&s;olute and &s;overeign power: And the oppo&s;ite lawyers do not deny it: They only Wert, that the &s;ubjects have al&s;o a fundamental property in their goods, and that no part of them can be taken but by their own con&s;ent in parliament, But that the parliament was in&s;tituted to check and controul the king, and &s;hare the &s;upreme power, would, in all former times, have been e&s;teemed very blunt and indi&s;creet, if not illegal, language. We need not be &s;urprized that government &s;hould long continue, tho' the boundaries of authority, in their &s;everal branches, be implicit, confu&s;ed, and undetermined. This is the ca&s;e all over the world. Who can draw an exact line between the &s;piritual and temporal powers in catholic &s;tates? What code a&s;certained the preci&s;e autho|rity of the Roman &s;enate, in every occurrence? Perhaps the Engli&s;h is the fir&s;t mixed government, where the authority of every part has been very ac|curately defined: And yet there still remain many very important que&s;tions between the two hou&s;es, that, by common con&s;ent, are buried in a di&s;creet &s;ilence. The king's power is, indeed, more exactly limited; but this pe|riod, of which we now treat, is the time at which that accuracy commenced. And it appears from Warwick and Hobbes, that many royali&s;ts blamed this philo&s;ophical preci&s;ion in the King's penman, and thought that the veil was very imprudently taken off the my&s;teries of government. 'Tis certain, that liberty reaped mighty advantages from the&s;e controver&s;ies and inquiries; and the royal authority it&s;elf became more &s;ecure, within tho&s;e provinces which were a&s;&s;igned to it. <HI>Since the fir&s;t publication of this hi&s;tory, the &s;equel of Lord Clarendon has been publi&s;hed; where that nobleman a&s;&s;erts, that be was the author of mo&s;t of the&s;e remnon&s;trances and memorials of the King.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P>THO' the&s;e writings were of consequence, and tended
much to reconcile the nation to Charles, it was evident that
they would not be deci&s;ive, and that keener weapons must
determine the controver&s;y. To the ordinance of the par|liament
concerning the militia, the King oppo&s;ed his com|mi&s;&s;ions
of array. The counties obeyed the one or the
other, according as they &s;tood affected. And in many

counties where the people were divided, mobbi&s;h combats
and &s;kirmi&s;hes en&s;ued<NOTE N="w" PLACE="foot">May, book ii. p. 99.</NOTE>. The parliament, on this occa&s;ion,

<P>THE magazine of Hull contained the arms of all the
forces levied against the Scots; and Sir John Hotham, the
governor, though he had accepted of a commi&s;&s;ion from
the parliament, was not thought to be much di&s;affected to
the church and monarchy. Charles, therefore, entertained
hopes, that, if he pre&s;ented him&s;elf at Hull before the
commencement of ho&s;tilities, Hotham, overawed by his
pre&s;ence, would admit him with his retinue; after which
he might ea&s;ily render him&s;elf ma&s;ter of the place. But
the governor was on his guard. He &s;hut the gates, and re|fu&s;ed
to receive the King, who de&s;ired leave to enter with
twenty per&s;ons only. Charles immediately proclaimed him
traitor, and complained to the parliament of his di&s;obedi|ence.

<P>THE armies, which had been every-where rai&s;ed on pre|tence
of the &s;ervice of Ireland, were henceforth more openly
inli&s;ted by the parliament for their own purpo&s;es, and the

no le&s;s than four thou&s;and men inli&s;ted in one day<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Vicar's God in the mount.</NOTE>. And the

<P>THEY i&s;&s;ued orders for bringing in loans of money and
plate,<NOTE PLACE="marg">10th June.</NOTE> in order to maintain forces which &s;hould defend the
King and both hou&s;es of parliament: For this &s;tyle they
&s;till pre&s;erved. Within ten days, va&s;t quantities of plate
were brought to their trea&s;urers. Hardly were there men
enough to receive it, or room &s;ufficient to &s;low it. And
many with regret were obliged to carry back their offerings,
and wait till the trea&s;urers could find lei&s;ure to receive
them. Such zeal animated the pious partizans of the par|liament
<PB N="426" REF="494">
e&s;pecially in the city! The women gave up all
the plate and ornaments of their hou&s;es, and; even their &s;ilver

<P>MEAN while the &s;plendor of the nobility, with which the
King was environed, much eclip&s;ed the appearance at We&s;t|min&s;ter.
The lord keeper, Littleton, after &s;ending the great
&s;eal before him, had fled to York. Above forty peers of
the fir&s;t rank attended the King<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">May, book ii. p. 59.</NOTE>, whil&s;t the hou&s;e of lords
&s;eldom con&s;i&s;ted of more than &s;ixteen members. Near the
moiety too of the lower hou&s;e ab&s;ented them&s;elves from
coun&s;els which they e&s;teemed &s;o full of danger. The com|mons
&s;ent up an impeachment again&s;t nine peers, for de&s;ert|ing
their duty in parliament. Their own members al&s;o,
who &s;hould return to them, they voted not to admit, till
&s;atisfied concerning the rea&s;on of their ab&s;ence.</P>
<P>CHARLES made a declaration to the peers who attended
him, that he expected from them no obedience to any com|mands
which were not warranted by the laws of the land.
The peers an&s;wered this declaration by a prote&s;t, in which
they declared their re&s;olution to obey no commands but &s;uch
as were warranted by that authority<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Ru&s;hworth, vol. v. p. 626, 627. May, book ii. p. 86. Warwick, p. 210.</NOTE>. By the&s;e deliberate
engagements, &s;o worthy of an Engli&s;h prince and Engli&s;h
nobility, they meant to confound the furious and tumultu|ary
re&s;olutions taken by the parliament.</P>
<P>THE Queen, di&s;po&s;ing of the crown-jewels in Holland,
had been enabled to purcha&s;e a large cargo of arms and
ammunition. Part of the&s;e, after e&s;caping many perils,
arrived &s;afely to the King. His preparations were not near
&s;o forward as tho&s;e of the parliament. In order to remove
all jealou&s;y, he had re&s;olved that their u&s;urpations and illegal
preten&s;ions should be apparent to the whole world, and
<PB N="427" REF="495">
Thought, that; to recover the confidence of the people,
was a point much more material to his intere&s;t than the
collecting any magazines, &s;tores, or armies, which might
breed apprehen&s;ions of violent or illegal coun&s;els. But the
urgent nece&s;&s;ity of his &s;ituation no longer admitted of delay.
He now prepared him&s;elf for defence. With a &s;pirit, acti|vity,
and addre&s;s, which neither the one party apprehended,
nor the other expected, he employed all the advantages
which remained to him, and rou&s;ed up his adherents to
arms. The re&s;ources of this Prince's genius increa&s;ed in
proportion to his difficulties; and he never appeared greater
than when plunged into the, deepe&s;t perils and di&s;tre&s;&s;es.
From the mixed character, indeed, of Charles, aro&s;e in part
the misfortunes in which England was at this time involved.
His political errors, or rather weakne&s;&s;es, had rai&s;ed him
inveterate enemies: His eminent moral virtues had pro|cured
him zealous parti&s;ans: And between the hatred of
the one and the affections of the other, was the nation
agitated with the mo&s;t violent convul&s;ions.</P>
<P>THAT the King might de&s;pair of all compo&s;ition, the
parliament &s;ent him the conditions on which they were
willing to come to agreement. Their demands, contained
in nineteen propo&s;tions, amounted to a total abolition of
monarchical authority. They required, that no man should
remain in the council, who was not agreeable to parliament;
that no deed of the King's should have validity, unle&s;s it
pa&s;&s;ed the council, and was atte&s;ted under their hand; that
all the officers of slate should be cho&s;en with con&s;ent of
parliament; that none of the royal family should marry
without con&s;ent of parliament or council; that the laws
should be executed again&s;t catholics; that the votes of
popi&s;h lords should be excluded; that the reformation of
the liturgy and church-government should have place, ac|cording
to advice of parliament; that the ordinance, with
regard to the militia, be &s;ubmitted to; that the ju&s;tice of
parliment may pa&s;s upon all delinquents; that a general

pardon be granted, with &s;uch exceptions as &s;hould be ad|vi&s;ed

War on any terms was e&s;teemed, by the King and all his
coun&s;elors, preferable to &s;o ignominious a peace. Charles
accordingly made account of &s;upporting his authority by
arms. &startq;His towns,&endq; he &s;aid,

his &s;hips, his arms, his money; but there dill remained

as tho&s;e of KING and PARLIAMENT, were
placed in oppo&s;ition to each other; no wonder the people
were divided in their choice, and were agitated with the
mo&s;t violent animo&s;ities and factions.</P>
<P>THE nobility, and more con&s;iderable gentry, dreading
a total con&s;u&s;ion of rank from the fury of the populace,
inlifted them&s;elves in defence of the monarch, from whom
they received, and to whom they communicated their lu&s;tre.
Animated with the &s;pirit of loyalty derived from their an|ce&s;tors,<NOTE PLACE="marg">State of parties.</NOTE>
they adhered to the ancient principles of the con&s;ti|tution,
and valued them&s;elves on exerting the maxims, as
well as inheriting the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, of the old English fami|lies.
And while they pa&s;&s;ed their time mo&s;tly in their
country-feats, they were &s;urpri&s;ed to hear of opinions pre|vailing,
with which they had ever been unacquainted, and
<PB N="430" REF="498">
which implied not a limitation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. LVI.</NOTE> but an abolition almo&s;l total,
of monarchical authority<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Among the other nobility, the Earl of Bri&s;tol, tho' long in the oppo&s;i|tion, when matters came to extremity, adhered to the court, and was pro&s;e|cuted with implacable hatred by the parliament, He died France in 1652</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE city of London, on the other hand, and mo&s;t of the
great corporations, took part with the parliament, and ad|opted
with zeal tho&s;e democratical principles, on which the
preten&s;ions of that a&s;&s;embly were founded. The govern|ment
of cities, which, even under ab&s;olute monarchies, is
commonly republican, inclined them to this party: The
&s;mall hereditary influence which can be retained over the
indu&s;trious inhabitants of towns; the natural independence
of citizens; and the force of popular currents over tho&s;e
more numerous a&s;&s;ociations of mankind; all there cau&s;es
gave, there, authority to the new principles propagated
throughout the nation. Many families too, which had
lately been enriched by commerce, &s;aw with indignation,
that, notwith&s;tanding their opulence, they could not rai&s;e
them&s;elves to a level with the antient gentry: They there|fore
adhered to a power, by who&s;e &s;ucce&s;s they hoped to
acquire rank and con&s;ideration,<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Clarendon, vol. iii. p. 4.</NOTE> And the new &s;plendor
and glory of the Dutch commonwealth, where liberty &s;a
happily &s;upported indu&s;try, made all the commercial part
of the nation ardently de&s;ire to &s;ee a like form of govern|ment
e&s;tabli&s;hed in England.</P>
<P>THE genius of the two religions, &s;o clo&s;ely at this time
interwoven with politics, corre&s;ponded exactly to the&s;e divi|&s;ions.
The pre&s;byterian religion was new, republican, and
&s;uited to the genius of the populace: The other had an
air of greater &s;how and ornament, was e&s;tabli&s;hed on an|tient
authority, and bore an affinity to the kingly and ari&s;to|cratical
parts of the coni&s;itution. The devotees of pre&s;by|tery
became of cour&s;e zealous partizans of the parliament:
<PB N="431" REF="499">
The friends of the epi&s;copal church valued them&s;elves on
defending the rights of monarchy.</P>
<P>SOME men al&s;o there were of liberal education, who,
being either carele&s;s or ignorant of tho&s;e di&s;putes, bandied
about by the clergy of both &s;ides, a&s;pired to nothing but
an ea&s;y enjoyment of life, amid&s;t the jovial entertainment and &s;ocial intercour&s;e of their companions. All the&s;e flocked
to the King's &s;tandard; where they breathed a freer air, and
were exempted from that rigid preci&s;ene&s;s and melancholy
au&s;terity which reigned among the parliamentary party.</P>
<P>NEVER was a quarrel more unequal than &s;eemed at fir&s;t
that between the contending parties: Almo&s;t every advan|tage
lay again&s;t the royal cau&s;e. The King's revenue had
been &s;eized, from the beginning, by the parliament, who
i&s;&s;ued out to him, from time to time, &s;mall &s;ums for his
pre&s;ent &s;ub&s;i&s;tence;, and as &s;oon as he withdrew to York,
they totally &s;topped all payments. London and all the &s;ea|ports,
except Newca&s;tle, being in their hands, the cu&s;toms
yielded them a certain and con&s;iderable &s;upply of money;
and all contributions, loans, and impo&s;itions, were more
ea&s;ily rai&s;ed from the cities which po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the ready money,
and where men lived under their in&s;pection, than they could
be levied by the King in tho&s;e open countries, which, after
&s;ome time, declared for him.</P>
<P>THE &s;eamen naturally followed the di&s;po&s;ition of the
&s;ea-ports to which they belonged: And the Earl of North|umberland,
lord admiral, having embraced the party of the
parliament, had named, at their de&s;ire, the Earl of War&s;wick
for his lieutenant; who at once a&s;tabli&s;hed his autho|rity
in the fleet, and kept the intire dominion of the &s;ea in
the hands of that a&s;&s;embly.</P>
<P>ALL the magazines of arms and ammunition were at fir&s;t
&s;eized by the parliament; and their fleet intercepted the
greate&s;t part of tho&s;e which were &s;ent by the Queen from
<PB N="432" REF="500">
Holland. The King was obliged, in order to arm his fol|lowers,
to borrow the weapons of the train-bands, under
promi&s;e of re&s;tornig them as &s;oon as peace &s;hould be &s;ettled
in the kindom.</P>
<P>THE veneration for parliaments was at that time extreme
throughout the nation<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Walker, p. 336.</NOTE>. The cu&s;tom of reviling tho&s;e a&s;|&s;emblies
for corruption, as it had no pretence, &s;o was it un|known,
during all former ages. Few or no in&s;tances of
their encroaching ambition or &s;elfi&s;h claims had hitherto been
ob&s;erved. Men con&s;idered the hou&s;e of commons in no
other light than as the repre&s;entatives of the nation, who&s;e
intere&s;t was the &s;ame with that of the public, who were the
eternal guardians of law and liberty, and whom no motive,
but the nece&s;&s;ary defen&s;e of the people, could ever engage
in an oppo&s;ition to the crown. The torrent, therefore, of
general affection, ran to the parliament. What is the. great
advantage of popularity; the privilege of affixing epithets
fell of cour&s;e to that party. The Kings adherents were the
<HI>Wicked</HI> and the <HI>Malignant:</HI> Their adver&s;aries were the
<HI>Godly</HI> and the <HI>Well-affected.</HI> And as the force of the cities
was more united than that of the country, and at once gave
&s;helter and protection to the parliamentary party, who could
ea&s;ily &s;uppre&s;s the royali&s;is in their neighbourhood; almo&s;t
the whole kingdom, at the commencement of the war, &s;eemed
to be in the hands of the parliament<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Warwick, p. 318.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>WHAT alone gave the King &s;ome compen&s;ation for all
the advantages po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by his adver&s;aries, was, the nature
and qualities of his adherents. More bravery and activity
were hoped for, from the generous &s;pirit of the nobles
and gentry, than from the ba&s;e di&s;po&s;ition of the multitude.
And as the men of e&s;ates, at their own expense, levied and
armed their tenants; be&s;ides an attachment to their ma&s;ters,
greater force and courage were to be expected in the&s;e
<PB N="433" REF="501">
ru&s;tic troops, than in the vicious and enervated populace of
cities.</P>
<P>THE neighbouring &s;tates of Europe, being engaged in
violent wars, little intere&s;ted them&s;elves in the&s;e civil com|motions;
and this i&s;land enjoyed the &s;ingular advantage (for
&s;uch it &s;urely was) of &s;ighting out its own quarrels without
the interpo&s;ition of foreigners. France, from policy, had
fomented the fir&s;t di&s;orders in Scotland; had &s;ent over arms
to the Iri&s;h rebels: and continued to give countenance to
the Engli&s;h parliament: Spain, from bigotry, furni&s;hed the
Iri&s;h with &s;ome &s;upplies of money and arms. The Prince
of Orange, clo&s;ely allied to the crown, encouraged Engli&s;h
officers, who &s;erved in the Low-countries, to inli&s;t in the
King's army: The Scots officers, who had been formed in
Germany, and in the late commotions, chiefly took part
with the parliament.</P>
<P>THE contempt, entertained by the parliament of the
King's party, was &s;o great, that it was the chief cau&s;e of
pu&s;hing matters to &s;uch extremity again&s;t him; and many
believed that he never would attempt re&s;i&s;tance, but mu&s;t
at la&s;t yield to the preten&s;ions, however enormous, of the
two hou&s;es. Even after his &s;tandard was erected, men
could not be brought to apprehend the danger of a civil
war: nor was it imagined that he would have the impru|dence
to enrage his implacable enemies, and render his own
condition more de&s;perate, by oppo&s;ing a force which was
&s;o much &s;uperior. The low condition, in which he ap|peared
at Nottingham, con&s;irmed all the&s;e hopes. His ar|tillery,
though far from numerous, he had been obliged to
leave at York, for want of hor&s;es to tran&s;port it: Be&s;ides
the trained bands of the county, rai&s;ed by Sir John Digby,
the &s;heriff, he had not got together above three hundred
infantry. His cavalry, in which con&s;i&s;ted his chief &s;trength,
exceeded not eight hundred, and were very ill provided of
arms. The forces of the parliament lay at Northampton,
<PB N="434" REF="502">
within a few days march of him; and con&s;i&s;ted of above
&s;ix thou&s;and men, well armed and well appointed. Had
the&s;e troops advanced upon the King, they mu&s;t &s;oon have
di&s;&s;ipated the &s;mall force which he had a&s;&s;embled. By
pur&s;uing him in his retreat, they would have &s;o di&s;credited
his cau&s;e and di&s;couraged his adherents, as to have for ever
prevented his gathering an army able to make head again&s;t
them. But the Earl of E&s;&s;ex, the parliamentary general,
had not yet received any orders from his ma&s;ters<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Clarendon, vol. iii. p. 1, 2.</NOTE> What
rendered them &s;o backward, after &s;uch precipitant &s;teps as
they had formerly taken, is not ea&s;ily explained. 'Tis pro|bable,
that in the extreme di&s;tre&s;s of his party con&s;i&s;ed the
pre&s;ent &s;afety of the King. The parliament hoped, that the
royali&s;ts, &s;en&s;ible of their feeble condition, and convinced
of their &s;lender re&s;ources, would di&s;per&s;e of them&s;elves,
and leave their adver&s;aries a victory, &s;o much the more
complete and &s;ecure, that it would be gained without the
appearance of force, and without blood&s;hed. Perhaps too,
when it became nece&s;&s;ary to make the concluding &s;tep, and
offer barefaced violence to their &s;overeign, their &s;cruples and
apprehen&s;ions, tho' not &s;u&s;ficient to overcome their re&s;olu|tions,
were able to retard the execution of them<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Idem ibid. p. 18.</NOTE></P>
<P>SIR Jacob A&s;tley, whom the King had appointed major|general
of his intended army, told him, that he could not
give him a&s;&s;urance but he might be taken out of his bed,
if the rebels &s;hould make a bri&s;k attempt to that purpo&s;e.
All the King's attendants were full of well-grounded appre|hen&s;ions.
Some of the lords having de&s;ired that a me&s;&s;age
might be &s;ent to the parliament, with overtures to a treaty;
Charles, who well knew that an accommodation, in his pre|&s;ent
condition, meant nothing but a total &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, ha&s;tily
broke up the council, left this propo&s;al &s;hould be farther
in&s;i&s;ted on. But next day, the Earl of Southampton, whom
no one could &s;u&s;pect of ba&s;e or timid coun&s;els, having
<PB N="435" REF="503">
offered the &s;ame advice, it was hearkened to with more
coolne&s;s and deliberation. He urged, That, tho' &s;uch a
&s;tep would probably increa&s;e the in&s;olence of the parlia|ment;
this was &s;o far from being an objection, that &s;uch
di&s;po&s;itions mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily turn to the advantage of the
royal cau&s;e: That if they refu&s;ed to treat, which was mo&s;t
probable, the very &s;ound of peace was &s;o popular, that
nothing could more di&s;gu&s;t the nation than &s;uch haughty
&s;everity: That if they admitted of a treaty, their propo|&s;als,
con&s;idering their pre&s;ent condition, would be &s;o exor|bitant,
as to open the eyes of their mo&s;t partial adherents,
and gain the general favour to the King's party: And that,
at wor&s;t, time might be gained by this expedient, and a
delay of the imminent danger with which the King was at
pre&s;ent threatened<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Clarendon, vol. iii. p. 7.</NOTE></P>
<P>CHARLES, on a&s;&s;embling the council, had declared
again&s;t all advances towards an accommodation; and had
&s;aid, that, having now nothing left him but his honour,
that la&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion he was re&s;olved &s;teddily to pre&s;erve, and
rather to peri&s;h than yield any farther to the preten&s;ions of
hid enemies<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Idem ibid.</NOTE> But by the concurrent de&s;ire of the coun|&s;ellors,
he was prevailed with to embrace Southampton's
advice. Thai nobleman, therefore, with Sir John Cole|peper
and Sir William Uvedale, was di&s;patched to London
with offers of a treaty<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Ru&s;h. vol. v. p. 784.</NOTE> The manner in which they were
received gave little hopes of &s;ucce&s;s. Southampton was
not allowed by the peers to take his feat; but was ordered
to deliver his me&s;&s;age to the u&s;her, and to depart the city
immediately: The commons &s;howed little better di&s;po&s;ition
to Colepeper and Uvedale<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Clarendon, vol. iii. p. 10.</NOTE> Both hou&s;es replied, that they

the two hou&s;es; but offered to recall the&s;e proclamations,
provided the parliament agreed to recall theirs, in which
his adherents were declared traitors. They de&s;ired him in

<P>THE courage of the parliament was &s;upported, be&s;ides
their great &s;uperiority of force, by two recent events which
had happened in their favour. Goring was governor of
Port&s;mouth, the be&s;t fortified town in the kingdom, and,
by its &s;ituation, of great importance. This man &s;eemed
to have rendered him&s;elf an implacable enemy to the King,
by betraying, probably magnifying, the &s;ecret cabals of the
army; and the parliament thought that his fidelity to them
might, on that account, be intirely depended on. But the
&s;ame levity of mind &s;till attended him, and the &s;ame di&s;|regard
to engagements and profe&s;&s;ions. He took under|hand
his mea&s;ures with the court, and declared again&s;t the
parliament. But, tho' he had been &s;ufficiently &s;upplied
with money, and long before knew his danger; &s;o &s;mall
was his forefight, that he had left the place intirely de&s;titute
of provi&s;ions, and, in a few days, he was obliged to &s;ur|render
to the forces of the parliament<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Ru&s;hworth, vol. v. p. 683. Whitlocke, p. 60. Cla|rendon, vol. iii. p. 19.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE Marquis of Hertford was a nobleman of the greate&s;t
quality and character in the kingdom, and, equally with
<PB N="437" REF="507">
the King, de&s;cended, by a female, from Henry VII. During
the reign of James, he had attempted, without having ob|tained
the con&s;ent of that monarch, to marry Arabella
Stuart, a lady nearly related to the crown; and, upon di&s;|covery
of his intention, had been obliged, for &s;ome time,
to fly the kingdom. Ever after, he was looked on with an
evil eye at court, from which, in a great mea&s;ure, he with|drew;
and, living in an independent manner, he addicted
him&s;elf intirely to literary occupations and amu&s;ements. In
proportion as the King declined in popularity, Hertford's
character flouri&s;hed with the people; and when this parlia|ment
a&s;&s;embled, no nobleman in the kingdom po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed more
general favour and authority. By his &s;agacity, he &s;oon
perceived that the commons, not content with correcting
the abu&s;es of government, were carried, by the natural
current of power and popularity, into the oppo&s;ite extreme,
and were committing violations, no le&s;s dangerous than the
former, upon the Engli&s;h con&s;titution. Immediately he
devoted him&s;elf to the &s;upport of the King's falling autho|rity,
and was prevailed with to be governor to the young
Prince, and re&s;ide in the court, to which, in the eyes of
all men, he gave; by his pre&s;ence, a new lu&s;tre and autho|rity.
So high was his character for mildne&s;s and humanity,
that he &s;till pre&s;erved, by means of the&s;e popular virtues,
the public favour; and every one was &s;en&s;ible of the true
motive of his change. Notwith&s;tanding his habits of ca&s;e
and &s;tudy, he now be&s;tirred him&s;elf in rai&s;ing an army for
the King; and being named general of the we&s;tern counties,
where his intere&s;t chiefty lay, he began to a&s;&s;emble forces
in Somer&s;et&s;hire. By the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Lord Seymour, Lord
Paulet, John Digby, &s;on to the Earl of Bri&s;tol, Sir Francis
Hawley, and others, he had drawn together fome appear|ance
of an army; when the parliament, apprehen&s;ive of the
danger, &s;ent the Earl of Bedford, with a con&s;iderable force
again&s;t him. On his appearance, Hertford was obliged to
retire into Sherborne ca&s;tle; and, finding that place inca|pable
<PB N="438" REF="508">
of defence, he him&s;elf pa&s;&s;ed over into Wales, leav|ing
Sir Ralph Hopton, Sir John Berkeley, Digby, and other
officers, with their hor&s;e, con&s;i&s;ting of about a hundred
and twenty, to march into Cornwall, in hopes of finding
that county better prepared for their reception<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Clarendon, vol. vi. p. 2, 3, &amp;c.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>ALL the di&s;per&s;ed bodies of the parliament's army were
now ordered to march to Northampton; and the Earl of
E&s;&s;ex, who had joined them; found the whole amount to
15,000 men<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Whitlocke, p. 60.</NOTE>. The King, though his camp had been gra|dually
reinforced from all quarters, was &s;en&s;ible that he
had no army which could cope with &s;o formidable a force;
and he thought it prudent, by &s;low marches, to retire to
Derby, and thence to Shrew&s;bury, in order to countenance
the levies which his friends were making in tho&s;e quarters.
At Wellington, a day's march from Shrew&s;bury, he made
a rendezvous of all his forces, and cau&s;ed his military orders
to be read at the head of each regiment. That he might
bind him&s;elf by reciprocal ties, he &s;olemnly took the fol|lowing
prote&s;tation before his whole army:</P>
<P>&startq; I do promi&s;e, in the pre&s;ence of Almighty God, and
as I hope for his ble&s;&s;ing and protection, that I will, to
the utmo&s;t of my power, defend and maintain the true
reformed prote&s;tant religion, e&s;tabli&s;hed in the church of
England, and, by the grace of God, in the &s;ame will
live and die.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq; I de&s;ire that the laws may ever be the mea&s;ure of my
government, and that the liberty and property of the
&s;ubject may be pre&s;erved by them with the &s;ame care as
my own ju&s;t rights. And if it plea&s;e God, by his ble&s;|&s;ing
on this army, rai&s;ed for my nece&s;&s;ary defence, to pre|&s;erve
me from the pre&s;ent rebellion; I do &s;olemnly and
faithfully promi&s;e, in the &s;ight of God, to maintain the
ju&s;t privileges and freedom of parliament, and to govern
<PB N="439" REF="509">
to the utmo&s;t of my power, by the known &s;tatutes and
cu&s;toms of the kingdom, and particularly, to ob&s;erve
inviolably the laws to which I have given my con&s;ent this
parliament. Mean while, if this emergence, and the
great nece&s;&s;ity to which I am driven, beget any violation
of law, I hope it &s;hall be. imputed by God and man to
the authors of this war; not to me, who have &s;o ear|ne&s;tly
laboured to pre&s;erve the peace of the kingdom.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq; WHEN I willingly fail in the&s;e particulars, I &s;hall ex|pect
no aid or relief from man, nor any protection from
above: But in this re&s;olution, I hope for the chearful
a&s;&s;i&s;tance of all good men, and am con&s;ident of the ble&s;|&s;ing
of heaven<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Clarendon, vol. iii. p. 16, 17. Dugdale, p. 104.</NOTE>.&endq;</P>
<P>THOUGH the concurrence of the church undoubtedly
increa&s;ed the King's adherents, it may &s;afely be affirmed,
that the high monarchical doctrines, &s;o much inculcated by
the clergy, had never done him any real &s;ervice. The bulk
of that generous train of nobility and gentry, who now at|tended
the King in his di&s;tre&s;&s;es, breathed the &s;pirit of li|berty
as well as of loyalty: And in the hopes alone of his
&s;ubmitting to a legal and limited government, were they
willing in his defence to &s;acrifice their lives and fortunes.</P>
<P>WHILE the King's army lay at Shrew&s;bury, and he was
employing him&s;elf in collecting money, which he received,
though in no great quantities, by voluntary contributions,
and by the plate of the univer&s;ities, which was &s;ent him;
the news arrived of an action, the fir&s;t which had happened
in the&s;e wars, and where he was &s;ucce&s;sful.</P>
<P>ON the appearance of commotions in England, the
princes Rupert and Maurice, &s;ons of the unfortunate Pala|tine,
had offered their &s;ervice to the King; and the for|mer,
at that time, commanded a body of hor&s;e, which had
been &s;ent to Worce&s;ter, in order to watch the motions of

E&s;&s;ex, who was marching towards that city. No &s;ooner
had the Prince arrived, than he &s;aw &s;ome cavalry of the
enemy approaching the gates. Without delay, he bri&s;kly
attacked them, as they were defiling from a lane, and form|ing
them&s;elves. Colonel Sandys, who led them, and who
fought with valour, being mortally wounded, fell from his
hor&s;e. The whole party was routed, and was pur&s;ued
above a mile. The Prince, hearing of E&s;&s;ex's approach,
retired to the King<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Clarendon, vol. iii. p. 25. May, book iii. p. 10.</NOTE>. This recounter, though in it&s;elf of
&s;mall importance, rai&s;ed mightily the reputation of the roy|ali&s;ts,
and acquired univer&s;ally to Prince Rupert the charac|ter
of promptitude and courage; qualities, which he emi|nently
di&s;played, during the whole cour&s;e of the war.</P>
<P>THE King, on mu&s;tering his army, found it about
10,000 men. The Earl of Linde&s;ey, who in his youth
had &s;ought experience of military &s;ervice in the Low-countries<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">He was then Lord Willoughby.</NOTE>,
was general: Prince Rupert commanded the
hor&s;e: Sir Jacob A&s;tley, the foot: Sir Arthur A&s;ton, the
dragoons: Sir John Heydon, the artillery. The Lord Ber|nard
Stuart was at the head of a troop of guards. The
e&s;tate and revenue of this &s;ingle troop, according to Lord
Clarendon's computation, was at lea&s;t equal to that of all
the members, who, at the commencement of war, voted
in both hou&s;es. Their &s;ervants, under the command of
Sir William Killigrew, made another troop, and always
marched with their ma&s;ters<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Clarendon, vol. iii. p. 41. Warwick, p. 231.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>WITH this army the King left Shrew&s;bury,<NOTE PLACE="marg">12th Oct.</NOTE> re&s;olving to
give battle as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible to the army of the parliament,
which he heard was continually augmenting by &s;upplies
from London. In order to bring on an action, he directed
his cour&s;e towards the capital, which, he knew, the enemy
would not abandon to him. E&s;&s;ex had now received his
<PB N="441" REF="513">
in&s;tructions. The import of them was, to pre&s;ent a mo&s;t
humble petition to the King, and to re&s;cue him and the
royal family from tho&s;e de&s;perate malignants who had &s;eized
their per&s;ons<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Whitlocke, p. 59. Clarendon, vol. iii. p. 27, 28, &amp;c.</NOTE>. Two days after the departure of the roy|ali&s;ts
from Shrew&s;bury, he left Worce&s;ter. Though it be
ea&s;y in civil wars to get intelligence, the two armies were
within &s;ix miles of each other, ere either of the generals
was acquainted with the approach of his enemy. Shrew&s;bury
and Worce&s;ter, the places from which they &s;et out,
are not above twenty miles di&s;tant; yet had the two armies
marched ten days in this mutual ignorance. So much had
military &s;kill, during a long peace, decayed in England<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Cla|rendon, vol. iii. p. 44.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE royal army lay near Banbury:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Battle of Edge-hill.</NOTE> That of the parlia|ment,
at Keinton,<NOTE PLACE="marg">23rd of Oct.</NOTE> in the county of Warwick. Prince Ru|pert
&s;ent intelligence of the approach of the enemy, Tho'
the day was far advanced, the King re&s;olved upon the at|tack:
E&s;&s;ex drew up his men to receive him. Sir Faithful
Forte&s;cue, who had levied a troop for the Iri&s;h wars, had
been obliged to &s;erve in the parliamentary army, and was
now po&s;ted on the left wing, commanded by Ram&s;ay, a
Scot&s;man. No &s;ooner did the King's army approach, than
Forte&s;cue, ordering his troop to di&s;charge their pi&s;tols in
the ground, put him&s;elf under the command of Prince
Rupert. Partly from this accident, partly from the furious
&s;hock made upon them by the Prince; that whole wing
of cavalry immediately fled, and were pur&s;ued for two
miles. The right wing of the parliament's army had no
better &s;ucce&s;s. Chaced from their ground by Wilmot and
Sir Arthur A&s;ton, they al&s;o took to flight. The King's
body of re&s;erve, commanded by Sir John Biron, judging,
like raw &s;oldiers; that all was over, and impatient to have
&s;ome &s;hare in the action, heedle&s;sly followed the chace,
which their left wing had precipitately led them. Sir
<PB N="442" REF="514">
William Balfour, who commanded E&s;&s;ex's re&s;erve, per|ceived
the advantage: He wheeled about upon the King's
infantry, now quite unfurni&s;hed of hor&s;e, and made great
havock among them. Linde&s;ey, the general, was mortally
wounded, and taken pri&s;oner. His &s;on, endeavouring his
re&s;cue, fell likewi&s;e into the enemy's hands. Sir Edmund
Verney, who carried the King's &s;tandard, was killed, and
the &s;tandard taken; but it was afterwards recovered. In
this &s;ituation, Prince Rupert, on his return, found af|fairs.
Every thing bore the appearance of a defeat, in&s;tead
of a victory, with which he had ha&s;tily flattered him&s;elf.
Some advi&s;ed the King to leave the field: But that prince
rejected &s;uch pu&s;illanimous coun&s;el. The two armies faced
each other for &s;ome time, and neither of them retained
courage &s;ufficient for a new attack. All night they lay un|der
arm's; and next morning found them&s;elves in &s;ight of
each other. General, as well as &s;oldier, on both &s;ides,
&s;eemed aver&s;e to renew the battle. E&s;&s;ex fir&s;t drew off,
and retired to Warwick. The King returned to his former
quarters. Five thou&s;and men are &s;aid to have been found
dead on the field of battle; and the lo&s;s of the two armies,
as far as we can judge by the oppo&s;ite accounts, was nearly
equal. Such was the event of this fir&s;t battle, fought at
Keinton or Edge-hill,<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Clarendon, vol. iii. p. 44, &amp;c. May, book iii. p. 16, &amp;c.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>SOME of E&s;&s;ex's hor&s;e, who had been drove off the
field in the beginning of the action, flying to a great di&s;tance,
carried news of a total defeat, and &s;truck a mighty
terror into the city and parliament. After a few days, a
more ju&s;t account arrived; and then the parliament pre|tended
to a complete victory<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Whit|locke, p. 61. Clarendon, ut &s;upra, p. 59.</NOTE>. The King al&s;o, on his
part, was not wanting to di&s;play his advantages; tho', ex|cept
the taking of Banbury, a few days after, he had few
<PB N="443" REF="515">
marks of victory to boast of. He continued his march,
and took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Oxford, the only town in his domi|nions
which was altogether at his devotion.</P>
<P>AFTER the royal army was recruited and refre&s;hed; as
the weather &s;till continued favourable, it was again put in
motion. A party of hor&s;e approached to Reading, of which
Martin was appointed governor by the parliament. Both
governor and garri&s;on were &s;eized with a panic, and fled
with precipitation to London. Charles, hoping that every
thing would yield before him, advanced with his whole
army to Reading. The parliament, who? in&s;tead of their
fond expectations that Charles would never be able to col|lect
an army, had now the pro&s;pect of a civil war, bloody,
and of uncertain event; were farther alarmed at the near
approach of the royal army, while their own forces lay at
a di&s;tance. They voted an addre&s;s for a treaty. The
King's nearer approach to Colebroke quickened their ad|vances.
Northumberland and Pembroke, with three com|moners,
pre&s;ented the addre&s;s of both hou&s;es; in which
they be&s;ought his Maje&s;ty to appoint &s;ome convenient place
where he might re&s;ide, till committees could attend him with
propo&s;als. The King named Wind&s;or, and de&s;ired that the
garri&s;on might be removed, and his own troops admitted
into that ca&s;tle<NOTE N="w" PLACE="foot">Whitlocke, p. 62. Clarendon, vol. iii. p. 73.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>MEAN while E&s;&s;ex,<NOTE PLACE="marg">30th Nov.</NOTE> advancing by ha&s;ty marches, had
arrived at London. But neither the pre&s;ence of his army,
nor the precarious hopes of a treaty, retarded the King's
approaches. Charles attacked; at Brentford, two regiments
quartered there, and, after a &s;harp action, beat them from
that village, and took about 500 pri&s;oners. The parli|ament
had &s;ent orders to forbear all ho&s;tilities, and had ex|pected
the &s;ame compliance from the King; though no
&s;tipulations to that purpo&s;e had been mentioned by their
<NOTE PLACE="foot">x Whitlocke, p. 62. Clarendon, ubi &s;up. p. 75.</NOTE>
<PB N="444" REF="516">
commi&s;&s;ioners. Loud complaints were rai&s;ed again&s;t this
attack, as if it had been the mo&s;t apparent perfidy, and
breach of treaty<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Whitlocke, p. 62. Clarendon, vol. iii. p. 75.</NOTE>. Enflamed with re&s;entment, as well as
anxious for its own defence, the city marched its trained
bands in excellent order, and joined the army under E&s;&s;ex.
The force of the parliamentary army now amounted to
above 24,000 men, and was much &s;uperior to that of the
King's<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Whitlocke, p. 62.</NOTE>. After both armies had faced each other for &s;ome
time, the King drew off and retired to Reading, and from
thence to Oxford.</P>
<P>WHILE the principal armies on both &s;ides were kept in
inaction by the winter-&s;ea&s;on, the King and parliament were
employed in real preparations for war, and in &s;eeming advances
towards peace. By means of contributions or a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ments,
levied by the hor&s;e, Charles maintained his cavalry:
By loans and voluntary pre&s;ents, &s;ent him from all parts of
the kingdom, he &s;upported his infantry: But the &s;upplies
were &s;till very unequal to the nece&s;&s;ities under which he
laboured<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Clarendon, vol. iii. p. 87.</NOTE>. The parliament had much greater re&s;ources for
money; and had, by con&s;equence, every military preparation
in much greater order and abundance. Be&s;ides an impo&s;ition
levied in London, amounting to the five-and-twentieth
part of every one's &s;ub&s;tance, they e&s;tabli&s;hed on that
city a weekly a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ment of 10,000 pounds, and another of
23,518, on the re&s;t of the kingdom<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Idem ibid. p. 171.</NOTE>. And as their authority
was at pre&s;ent e&s;tabli&s;hed in mo&s;t counties, they levied
the&s;e taxes with great regularity; though they amounted to
&s;ums much beyond what the nation had formerly paid to
the public exigencies.</P>
<P>THE King and parliament &s;ent reciprocally their demands;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1643.</NOTE>
and a treaty commenced, but without any ce&s;&s;ation
of ho&s;tilities, as had at fir&s;t been propo&s;ed. The Earl of
<PB N="445" REF="517">
Northumberland,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Negotiation at Oxford.</NOTE> and four members of the lower hou&s;e
came to Oxford as commi&s;&s;ioners<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Whitlocke, p. 64.</NOTE>. In this treaty, the
King perpetually in&s;i&s;ted on the re-e&s;tabli&s;hment of the
crown in its legal powers, and on the re&s;toration of his con|&s;titutional
prerogative<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Ru&s;h. vol. vi. p. 202.</NOTE>: The parliament &s;till required new
conce&s;&s;ions, and a farther abridgment of regal authority, as
a more effectual remedy to their fears and jealou&s;ies. Find|ing
the King &s;upported by more forces and a greater party
than they had ever looked for, they &s;eemingly abated &s;ome|what
of tho&s;e exorbitant conditions which they had formerly
claimed; but their demands were &s;till too great for an equal
treaty. Be&s;ides other articles, to which a complete victory
could alone intitle them, they required the King, in ex|pre&s;s
terms, utterly to aboli&s;h epi&s;copacy; a demand, which,
before, they only in&s;inuated: And they required, that all
other eccle&s;ia&s;tical controver&s;ies &s;hould be determined by
<HI>their</HI> a&s;&s;embly of divines; that is, in the manner the mo&s;t
repugnant to the inclinations of the King and all his parti|zans.
They likewi&s;e de&s;ired him to acquie&s;ce in their &s;et|tlement
of the militia, and to confer on their adherents the
intire authority of the &s;word. And in an&s;wer to the King's
propo&s;al, that his magazines, towns, forts, and &s;hips, &s;hould
be re&s;tored to him, the parliament required, that they &s;hould
be put into &s;uch hands as they could confide in<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Idem ibid. p. 166. Clarendon, vol. iii. p. 119.</NOTE>: The

His unhappine&s;s was, that he had a better opinion of others judgments than of his own, though they were weaker than his own; and of this the par|liament-commi&s;&s;ioners had experience to their great trouble. They were often waiting on the King, and debating &s;ome points of the treaty with him, until midnight, before they could come to a conclu&s;ion. Upon one of the mo&s;t material points, they pre&s;&s;ed his Maje&s;ty with their rea&s;ons and be&s;t arguments they could u&s;e to grant what they de&s;ired.

But next morning the King told them, that he had altered his mind: And &s;ome of his friends, of whom the commi&s;&s;ioners inquired, told them, that after they were gone, and even his council retired, &s;ome of his bed-chamber never left preffing and per&s;uading him till they prevailed on him to change his former re&s;olutions.&endq; It is difficult, however, to conceive, that any treaty could have &s;ucceeded betwixt the King and parliament, while the latter in&s;i&s;ted, as they all along did, on a total &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to all their demands; and challenged the whole power, which they intended to employ, to the puni&s;hment of all the King's friends.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE conferences went no farther than the fir&s;t demand

early in the &s;pring, was immediately undertaken. Reading,
the garri&s;on of the King, which lay neare&s;t London, was
e&s;teemed a place of considerable &s;trength, in that age, when
<PB N="447" REF="521">
the art of attacking towns was not well under&s;tood in Eur|ope,<NOTE PLACE="marg">15th April.</NOTE>
and was totally unknown in England. The Earl of
E&s;&s;ex &s;at down before this place with an army of 18,000
men; and carried on his attacks by regular approaches.
Sir Arthur A&s;ton,<NOTE PLACE="marg">27th April</NOTE> the governor, being wounded, Colonel
Fielding &s;ucceeded to the command. In a little time the
town was found to be no longer in a condition of defence;
and though the King approached, with an intention of ob|liging
E&s;&s;ex to rai&s;e the &s;iege, the di&s;po&s;ition of the parlia|mentary
army was &s;o &s;trong, as rendered that de&s;ign imprac|ticable.
Fielding, therefore, was contented to yield the
town, on condition that he &s;hould bring off all the garri&s;on
with the honours of war, and deliver up de&s;erters. This
la&s;t condition was thought &s;o ignominious and &s;o prejudi|cial
to the King's intere&s;t, that the governor was tried by
a council of war, and condemned to lo&s;e his life for con|&s;enting
to it. His &s;entence was afterwards remited by the
King<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Ru&s;h. vol. vi, p. 265, &amp;c. Clarendon, vol. iii. p. 237, 238, &amp;c.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>ESSEX's army had been fully &s;upplied with all nece&s;&s;aries
from London: Even many &s;uperfluities and luxuries were
&s;ent them by the care of the zealous citizens: Yet the hard|&s;hips
which they &s;uffered from the &s;iege, during &s;o early a
&s;ea&s;on, had weakened them to &s;uch a degree, that they were
no longer fit for any new enterprize. And the two armies,
for &s;ome time, encamped in the neighbourhood of each
other, without attempting, on either &s;ide, any action of
moment.</P>
<P>BESIDES the military operations between the principal
armies, which lay in the centre of England; each county,
each town, each family almo&s;t, was divided within it&s;elf;
and the mo&s;t violent convul&s;ions &s;hook the whole kingdom.
Throughout the winter, continual efforts had every-where
<PB N="448" REF="522">
been made by each party to &s;urmount its, antagoni&s;t;
and the Engli&s;h, rouzed from the lethargy of peace, with
eager, though un&s;kilful hands, employed again&s;t their fel|low-citizens
their long-neglected weapons. The furious
zeal for liberty and pre&s;byterian di&s;cipline, which had hi|therto
run uncontrouled through the nation, now at la&s;t
excited an equal ardour for monarchy and epi&s;copacy; when
the intention of aboli&s;hing the&s;e antient modes of govern|ment
was openly avowed by the parliament. Conventions
for neutrality, though, in &s;everal counties, they had been
entered into, and confirmed by the mo&s;t &s;olemn oaths, yet,
being voted illegal by the two hou&s;es, were immediately
broke<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Clarendon, vol. iii. p. 137, 139.</NOTE>; and the fire of di&s;cord was &s;pread into every
quarter. The altercation of di&s;cour&s;e, the controver&s;ies of
the pen, but, above all, the declamations of the pulpit, in|di&s;po&s;ed
the minds of men towards each other, and propa|gated
the blind rage of party<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Dugdale, p. 95.</NOTE>. Fierce, however, and in|flamed
as were the di&s;po&s;itions of the Engli&s;h, by a war both
civil and religious, that great de&s;troyer of humanity; all the
events of this period are le&s;s di&s;tingui&s;hed by atrocious deeds
either of treachery or cruelty, than were ever any inte&s;tine
di&s;cords which had &s;o long a continuance. A circum&s;tance
which will be found to imply great prai&s;e of the national
character of that people, now &s;o unhappily rouzed to arms.</P>
<P>IN the north, the Lord Fairfax commanded for the par|liament,
the Earl. of Newca&s;tle for the King. This la&s;t
nobleman began tho&s;e a&s;&s;ociations which were afterwards &s;o
much practi&s;ed in other parts of the kingdom. He united
in a league for the King the counties of Northumberland,
Cumberland, We&s;tmoreland, and the Bi&s;hoprick, and en|gaged,
&s;ome time after, other counties in the &s;ame a&s;&s;ocia|tion.
Finding that Fairfax, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by Hotham and the
garri&s;on of Hull, was making progre&s;s in the &s;outhern parts
of York&s;hire; he advanced with a body of four thou&s;and
<PB N="449" REF="523">
men, and took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of York. At Tadca&s;ter, he at|tacked
the forces of the parliament, and di&s;lodged them:
But his victory was not deci&s;ive. In other rencounters he
obtained &s;ome incon&s;iderable advantages. But the chief
benefit, which re&s;ulted from his eaterprizes, was, the e&s;ta|bli&s;hing
the King's authority in all the northern provinces.</P>
<P>IN another part of the kingdom, the Lord Broke was
killed by a &s;hot, while he was taking po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Litchfield
for the parliament<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">He was taking a view from a window of St. Chad's cathedral in Litch|field, where a party of the royali&s;ts had fortified them&s;elves. He was ca&s;ed in complete armour, but was &s;hot through the eye by a random-ball. He was a zealous puritan; and had formerly &s;aid, that he hoped to &s;ee with his eyes the ruin of all the cathedrals of England. It was a &s;uper&s;titious remark of the royali&s;ts, that he was killed on St. Chad's day by a &s;hot from St. Chad's cathedral, which pierced that very eye by which he hoped to &s;ee the ruin of all cathedrals, Dugdale, p. 118.

between the Earl of Northampton and Sir John Gell, the

the action, retreated into the town of Stafford<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Whit|locke, p. 66. Ru&s;h. vol. vi. p. 152. Clarendon, vol. iii. p. 151.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>SIR William Waller began to di&s;tingui&s;h him&s;elf among
the generals of the parliament. Active and indefatigable in
his operations, rapid and enterpri&s;ing; he was fitted by his
genius to the nature of the, war; which being managed by
raw troops, conducted by unexperienced commanders, af|forded
&s;ucce&s;s to every bold and &s;udden undertaking. After
taking. Winche&s;ter and Chiche&s;ter, he advanced, towards
Glouce&s;ter, which was in a manner blockaded by Lord
Herbert, who had levied con&s;iderable forces in Wales for
the royal party<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Ru&s;h. vol. vi. p. 92, 100.</NOTE>. While he attacked the Wel&s;h on one &s;ide,
a &s;ally from Glouce&s;ter made impre&s;&s;ion on the other. Her|bert
was defeated; five hundred of his men killed on the
&s;pot; a thou&s;and taken pri&s;oners; and he him&s;elf e&s;caped
<PB N="450" REF="524">
with &s;ome difficulty to Oxford. Hereford, e&s;teemed a &s;trong
town, defended by a con&s;iderable garri&s;on, was &s;urrendered
to Waller, from the cowardice of Colonel Price the go|vernor.
Tewke&s;bury underwent the &s;ame fate. Worce&s;ter
refu&s;ed him admittance; and Waller, without placing any
garri&s;ons in his new conque&s;ts, retired to Glouce&s;ter, and
from thence he joined the army under the Earl of E&s;&s;ex<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Ru&s;hworth, vol. vi. p. 263.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BUT the mo&s;t memorable actions of valour,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Victories of the royali&s;ts in the we&s;t.</NOTE> during this
winter-&s;ea&s;on. were performed in the we&s;t, When Sir
Ralph Hopton, with; his &s;mall troop, retied into Cornwall
before the Earl of Bedford, that nobleman, de&s;pi&s;ing &s;o in|con&s;iderable
a force, abandoned the pur&s;uit, and committed
the ta&s;k of &s;uppre&s;&s;ing the royal party to the &s;heriffs of the
County. But the affections of Cornwall were much inclined
to the King's &s;ervice. While Sir Richard Buller and Sir
Alexander Carew lay at Launce&s;ton, and employed them|&s;elves
in executing the parliament's ordinance for the mili|tia,
a meeting of the county was a&s;&s;embled at Truro; and
after Hopton produced his commi&s;&s;ion from the Earl of
Hert&s;ord, the King's general, it was agreed to execute the
laws, and to expel the&s;e invaders of the county. The trained
bands were accordingly levied, Launce&s;ton taken, and all
Cornwall reduced to peace and to obedience under the
King.</P>
<P>IT had been u&s;ual for the royal party, on the com|mencement
of the&s;e di&s;orders, to claim, on all occa&s;ions, the
&s;trict: execution of the laws, which they knew were favour|able
to them; and the parliament, rather than have recour&s;e
to the plea of $ece&s;&s;ity, and avow the tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion of any
&s;tatute, bad al&s;o been accu&s;tomed to warp the laws, and,
by forced con&s;truclions, to interpret them in their own fa|vour<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Clarendn, vol. iii. p. 130.</NOTE>.
But though, the King was naturally the gainer by
&s;uch a method of conducting war, and it was by favour of
law that the trained bands were rai&s;ed in Cornwall; it ap|peared
<PB N="451" REF="525">
that the&s;e maxims were now prejudicial to the royal
party. The&s;e troops could not legally, without their own
con&s;ent, be carried out of the county; and con&s;equently,
it was impo&s;&s;ible to pu&s;h into Devon&s;hire the advantage
which, they had obtained. The Corni&s;h royali&s;ts, there|fore,
bethought therm&s;elves of levying a force which might
be more &s;erviceable. Sir Bevil Granville, the mo&s;t beloved
man of that country, Sir Ralph Hopton, Sir Nicholas Slan|ning,
Arundel, and Trevannion, undertook, at their own
charges, to rai&s;e an army for the King; and their great in|tere&s;t
in Cornwall &s;oon enabled them to effect their purpo&s;e.
The parliament, alarmed at this appearance of the royali&s;ts,
gave a commi&s;&s;ion to Ruthven, a Scot&s;man, governor of
Plymouth, to march with all the forces of Dor&s;et, Somer&s;et,
and Devon, and make an intire conque&s;t of Cornwall. The
Earl of Stamford followed him, at &s;ome di&s;tance, with a
con&s;iderable &s;upply. Ruthven, having entered Cornwall
by bridges thrown over the Tamar, ha&s;tened to an action;
left Stamford &s;hould join him, and obtain the honour of
that victory which he looked for with a&s;&s;urance. The roy|ali&s;ts,
in like manner, were impatient to bring the affair to
a deci&s;ion, before Ruthven's army &s;hould receive &s;o con&s;i|derable
a reinforcement. The battle was fought on Bradock
down; and the King's forces, though inferior in number,
gave a total, defeat to their enemies. Ruthven, with a few
broken troops, fled to Salta&s;h; and when that town was
taken, he e&s;caped, with &s;ome difficulty, and almo&s;t alone
into Plymouth. Stamford retired, and di&s;tributed his forces
into Plymouth and Exeter.</P>
<P>NOTWITHSTANDING the&s;e advantages, the extreme
want both of money and ammunition, under which the
Corni&s;h royali&s;ts laboured, obliged them to enter into a
convention of neutrality with the parliamentary party in
Devon&s;hire; and this neutrality, held all the winter-&s;ea&s;on.
In the &s;pring it was broken by the authority of the two
<PB N="452" REF="526">
hou&s;es;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Battle of Stratton, May 16th.</NOTE> and war recommenced with great appearance of
di&s;advantage to the King's party. Stamford, having a&s;|&s;embled
a &s;trong body of near &s;even thou&s;and men, well
&s;upplied with money, provi&s;ions, and ammunition, ad|vanced
upon the royali&s;ts, who were not, half his number,
and were oppre&s;&s;ed by every kind of nece&s;&s;ity. De&s;pair,
joined to the natural gallantry of the&s;e troops, commanded
by the prime gentry of the county, made them re&s;olve, by
one vigorous effort, to overcome all the&s;e di&s;advantages.
Stamford being encamped on the top of a high hill near
Stratton, they attacked him in four divi&s;ions, at five in
the morning, having lain all night under arms. One divi&s;ion
was commanded by Lord Mohun and Sir Ralph Hopton, an|other
by Sir Bevil Granville and Sir John Berkeley, a third
by Slanning and Trevannion, a fourth by Ba&s;&s;et and Go|dolphin.
In this manner the action began; the King's
forces pre&s;&s;ing with the utmo&s;t vigour tho&s;e four ways up
the hill, and their enemies as ob&s;tinately defending them|selves.
The fight continued with very doubtful &s;ucce&s;s,
till word was brought to the chief officers of the Corni&s;h,
that their ammunition was &s;pent to le&s;s than four barrels
of powder. This defect, which they concealed from the &s;ol|diers,
they re&s;olved to &s;upply by then valour. They agreed
to advance without firing till they &s;hould reach the top of
the hill, and could be on equal ground with the enemy.
The courage of the officers was &s;o well &s;econded by the
&s;oldiers, that the royali&s;ts began on all &s;ides to gain ground.
Major-general Chidley, who commanded the parliament|army
(for Stamford kept at a di&s;tance) failed not in his duty;
and when he &s;aw his men recoil, him&s;elf advanced with a good
&s;tand of pikes, and, piercing into the thicke&s;t of the enemy,
was at la&s;t overpowered with numbers and taken pri&s;oner.
His army, upon this di&s;a&s;ter, gave ground apace; in&s;omuch
that the four parties of the royali&s;ts, growing, nearer and
nearer as they a&s;cended, at la&s;t all met together upon the
plain at the top; where they embraced with great joy, and
<PB N="453" REF="527">
&s;ignalized their victory with loud &s;houts and mutual congratulations<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Ru&s;h. vol. vi. p. 267, 273. Clarendon, vol. iii. p. 269, 279.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>AFTER this &s;ucce&s;s,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Battle of Lan&s;down.</NOTE> the attention of both King and par|liament
was turned towards the we&s;t,<NOTE PLACE="marg">5th July.</NOTE> as to a very import|ant
&s;cene of action. The King &s;ent the Marquis of Hert|ford
and Prince Maurice with a reinforcement of cavalry;
who, having joined the Corni&s;h army, &s;oon over-ran the
county of Devon; and advancing into that of Somer&s;et,
began to reduce it to obedience. On the other hand, the
parliament having &s;upplied Sir William Waller, in whom
they much tru&s;ted, with a complete army, di&s;patched him
we&s;twards, in order to check the progre&s;s of the royali&s;ts.
After &s;ome &s;kirmi&s;hes, the two armies met at Lan&s;down,
near Bath, and fought a pitched battle, with great lo&s;s on
both &s;ides, but without any deci&s;ive event<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Ru&s;h. ut &s;upra, p. 284. Clarendon, ut &s;upra, p. 282.</NOTE>. The gallant
Granville was there killed; and Hopton, by the blowing
up of &s;ome powder, was dangerou&s;ly hurt. The royali&s;ts
next attempted to march ea&s;twards, and to join their forces
to the King's at Oxford: But Waller hung on their rear,
and infe&s;ted their march till they reached the Devizes. Re|inforced
by additional troops, which flocked to him from
all quarters; he &s;o much &s;urpa&s;&s;ed the royali&s;ts in number,
that they dur&s;t no longer continue their march, or expo&s;e
them&s;elves to the hazard of an action. It was re&s;olved that
Hertford and Prince Maurice &s;hould proceed with the ca|valry;
and, having procured a reinforcement from the
King, &s;hould ha&s;ten back to the relief of their friends in
the Devizes. Waller was &s;o confident of taking this body
of infantry, now abandoned by their friends, that he wrote
to the parliament, that their work was done, and that,
by the next po&s;t, he would inform them of the number
and quality of the pri&s;oners. But the King, even be|fore
Hertford's arrival, hearing of the great difficulties to
<PB N="454" REF="528">
which his we&s;tern army was reduced,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Battle of Roundway|down. 13th July.</NOTE> had prepared a con|&s;iderable
body of hor&s;e, which he immediately di&s;patched
under the command of Lord Wilmot. Waller drew up on
Roundway-down, about two miles from the Devizes; and
advancing with his hor&s;e to fight Wilmot, and prevent his
conjunction with the Corni&s;h infantry, was received with
equal valour by the royali&s;ts. After a &s;harp action he was
totally routed, and, flying with a few hor&s;e, e&s;caped to
Bri&s;tol. Then Wilmot, &s;eizing the enemy's cannon, and hav|ing
joined his friends whom he came to relieve, attacked
Waller's infantry with redoubled courage; drove them off
the field, and routed and di&s;per&s;ed the whole army<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Ru&s;hworth, vol. vi. p. 285. Clarendon, vol. iii. p. 291.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THIS important victory, following &s;o quick after many
other &s;ucce&s;&s;es, &s;truck great di&s;may into the parliament, and
gave an alarm to their principal army commanded by E&s;&s;ex.
Waller exclaimed loudly again&s;t that general, for allowing
Wilmot to pa&s;s him, and proceed without any interruption
to the &s;uccour of the distre&s;&s;ed infantry at the Devizes. But
E&s;&s;ex, finding that his army fell continually to decay after
the &s;iege of Reading, was re&s;olved to remain upon the de|fen&s;ive;
and the weakne&s;s of the King, and the want of
all military &s;tores, had al&s;o re&s;trained the activity of the
royal army. No action had happened in that part of Eng|land,
except one &s;kirmi&s;h, which, of it&s;elf, was of no great
con&s;equence, and was rendered memorable by the death
alone of the famous Hambden.</P>
<P>COLONEL Urrey, a Scot&s;man, who &s;erved in the parlia|ment's
army, having received &s;ome di&s;gu&s;t, came to Ox|ford,
and offered his &s;ervice to the King. In order to
prove the &s;incerity of his conver&s;ion, he informed Prince.
Rupert of the loo&s;e di&s;po&s;ition of the enemy's quarters, and
exported him to form &s;ome attempt upon them. The
Prince, who was intirely fitted for that kind of &s;ervice,
falling &s;uddenly upon the di&s;per&s;ed bodes of E&s;&s;ex's army,
<PB N="455" REF="529">
routed two regiments of cavalry and one of infantry,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Death of Hambden.</NOTE> and
carried his ravages within two miles of the general's quar|ters.
The alarm being given, every one mounted on hor&s;e|back,
in order to pur&s;ue the Prince, to recover the pri&s;on|ers,
and to repair the di&s;grace which the army had &s;u&s;tained.
Among the re&s;t, Hambden, who had a regiment of infantry
that lay at a di&s;tance, joined the hor&s;e as a volunteer; and
overtaking the royali&s;ts on Chalgrave field, entered into the
thicke&s;t of the battle. By the bravery and activity of Ru|pert,
the King's troops were brought off, and a great booty,
together with two hundred pri&s;oners, was conveyed to Ox|ford.
But, what mo&s;t plea&s;ed the royali&s;ts, was, the expecta|tion
that &s;ome di&s;ta&s;ter had happened to Hambden, their
capital and much-dreaded enemy. One of the pri&s;oners
taken in the action &s;aid, that he was confident Mr. Hamb|den
was hurt: For he &s;aw him, contrary to his u&s;ual cu&s;|tom,
ride off the field, before the action was fini&s;hed; his
head hanging down, and his hands leaning upon his, hor&s;e's
neck. Next day, the news arrived, that he was &s;hot in the
&s;houlder with a brace of bullets, and the bone broke.
Some days after, he died, in exqui&s;ite pain, of his wound;
nor could his whole party, had their army met with a total
overthrow, have been ca&s;t into greater con&s;ternation. The
King him&s;elf &s;o highly valued him, that, either from ge|nero&s;ity
or policy, he intended to have &s;ent him his own
&s;urgeon to a&s;&s;i&s;t at his cure<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Warwick's Memoirs, p. 241. Clarendon, vol. i. p. 264.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>MANY were the virtues and talents of this eminent per|sonage;
and his valour, during the war, had &s;hone out
with a lu&s;tre equal to that of all the other accomplishments
by which he had ever been &s;o much distingui&s;hed. Affabi|lity
in conver&s;ation; temper, art, and eloquence in debate;
penetration and di&s;cernment in coun&s;el; indu&s;try, vigilance
and enterprize in action; all the&s;e prai&s;es are unanimou&s;ly
a&s;cribed to him by hi&s;torians of the mo&s;t oppo&s;ite parties.
<PB N="456" REF="530">
His virtue too and; integrity, in all the duties of private life,
are allowed to have been beyond exception. We mu&s;t only
be cautious, notwith&s;tanding his generous zeal for liberty,
not ha&s;tily to a&s;cribe to him the prai&s;es of a good citizen.
Through all the horrors of civil war, he &s;ought; the aboli|tion
of monarchy, and &s;ubver&s;ion of the con&s;titution; an
end, which, had it been attainable by peaceful mea&s;ures,
ought carefully to have been avoided by every lover of his
country. But Whether, in the pur&s;uit of this violent enter|prize,
he was actuated by private ambition, or by hone&s;t
prejudices, derived from former abu&s;es of royal authority,
it belongs not to an hi&s;torian of this age, &s;carce even to an
intimate friend, po&s;itively to determine<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">The author is &s;en&s;ible, that much blame may be thrown upon him, on, account of this la&s;t clau&s;e in Mr. Hambden's character; as if he was willing to entertain a &s;u&s;picion of bad intentions, where the actions were prai&s;e-worthy. But the author's, meaning is directly contrary: He e&s;teems the la&s;t actions of Mr. Hambden's life to have been very blameable; though, as they were de|rived from good motives, only pu&s;hed to an extreme, there is room left to be|lieve, that the intentions of that patriot, as well as of many of his party, were extremely laudable. Had the preceding admini&s;tration of the King, which we, are apt to call arbitrary, proceeded from ambition, and an unju&s;t de&s;ign of encroaching on the ancient liberties, of the people, there would have been le&s;s rea&s;on for giving him any tru&s;t, or leaving in his hands a con|siderable hate of that power which he had &s;o much abu&s;ed. But if his con|duct was derived in a great mea&s;ure from nece&s;&s;ity, and from a natural de&s;ire of defending that prerogative which was tran&s;mitted to him from his ance&s;tors, and which his parliament was vi&s;ibly encroaching on; there is no rea&s;on why he may not be e&s;teemed a very virtuous prince, and intirely worthy of tru&s;t from his, people. The attempt, therefore, of totally annihilating monarchi|cal power, was a very blameable extreme; e&s;pecially as it was attended with the danger, to &s;ay the lea&s;t, of a civil war, which, be&s;ides the numberle&s;s ills attending it, expo&s;ed liberty to much greater perils than, it could have in|curred under the now limited authority of the King. But as the&s;e points, could not be &s;uppo&s;ed &s;o clear during the time as they are, or may be, at pre|&s;ent; there are great rea&s;ons of alleviation for men who were heated by the controver&s;y, or engaged in the action. And it is remarkable, that even at pre&s;ent (&s;uch is the force of party prejudices) there are few people who have, coolne&s;s enough to $e the&s;e matters in a proper light, or are convinced that the parliament could prudently have &s;topped in their preten&s;ions. They &s;till plead the violations of liberty attempted by the king after granting the pe|tition of right; without con&s;idering the extreme har&s;h treatment which he met with, after making what great conce&s;&s;ion, and the impo&s;&s;ibility of sup|porting the government by the revenue then &s;ettled on the crown. The wor&s;t of it is, that there was a great tang if enthu&s;ia&s;m in the conduct of the par|liamentary leaders, which, though it might render their conduct &s;incere, will not much enhance their character with po&s;terity. And tho' Hambden was, perhaps, le&s;s infected with this &s;pirit than many of his a&s;&s;ociates, he ap|pears not to have been altogether free from it.</NOTE>.</P>

ESSEX, di&s;couraged by this event, di&s;mayed by the total
rout of Waller, was farther informed that the Queen, who
had landed in Burlington-bay, had arrived at Oxford, and
had brought from the north a reinforcement of three thou|&s;
and foot and fifteen hundred hor&s;e. Di&s;lodging from Thame
and Ayle&s;bury, where he had hitherto lain, he thought pro|per
to retreat nearer London, and he &s;howed to his friends
his broken and disheartened forces, which a few months
before he had led into the field in &s;o flouri&s;hing a condition.
The King, freed from this enemy, &s;ent his army we&s;tward
under Prince Rupert; and, by their conjunction with the
Corni&s;h troops, a very formidable force, for numbers as
well as reputation and valour, was compo&s;ed. That an en|terprize,
corre&s;pondent to mens expectations, might be
undertaken, the Prince re&s;olved to lay &s;iege to Bri&s;tol, the
&s;econd town for riches and greatne&s;s in the kingdom. Na|thaniel
Fiennes, &s;on to Lord Say, him&s;elf, as well as his
father, a great parliamentary leader, was governor, and
commanded a garri&s;on of two thou&s;and five hundred foot,
and two regiments, one of hor&s;e, another of dragoons.
The fortifications not being complete or regular, it was re|solved
by Prince Rupert to &s;torm the city; and next morn|ing,
with little other provi&s;ions, &s;uitable to &s;uch a work,
be&s;ides the courage of the troops, the a&s;&s;ault began. The
Corni&s;h, in three divi&s;ions, attacked the we&s;t fide, with a
re&s;olution which nothing but death could controul: But
though the middle, divi&s;ion had already mounted the wall;
&s;o great was the di&s;advantage of the ground, and &s;o brave

the defence of the garri&s;on,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bri&s;tol taken. 25th July.</NOTE> that in the end the a&s;&s;ailants
were repul&s;ed, with a con&s;iderable lo&s;s both of officers and
&s;oldiers. On the Prince's &s;ide, the a&s;&s;ault was conducted
with equal courage, and almo&s;t with equal lo&s;s, but with
better &s;ucce&s;s. One party, led by Lord Grandi&s;on, was
beat off, and the commander him&s;elf mortally wounded:
Another, conducted by Colonel Bella&s;is, met with a like
fate: But Wa&s;hington, with a le&s;s party, finding a place in
the curtain weaker than the re&s;t, broke in, and quickly
made room for the hor&s;e to follow. By this irruption,
however, nothing but the &s;uburbs was yet gained: The
entrance into the town was &s;till more difficult: And by the
lo&s;s already &s;u&s;tained, as well as by the pro&s;pect of farther
danger, every one was extremely di&s;couraged: When, to the
great joy of the whole army, the city, beat, a parley. The
garri&s;on were allowed to march out with, their arms and
baggage, leaving their cannon, ammunition, and colours.
For this in&s;tance of cowardice, Fiennes was afterwards tried
by a court-martial, and condemned to lo&s;e his head; but
the &s;entence was remitted by the general<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Ru&s;thworth, vol. vi. p. 284. Clarendon, vol. iii. p. 293, 294, &amp;c.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>GREAT complaints were made of violences exerci&s;ed on
the garri&s;on, contrary to the capitulation. An apology was
made, by the royali&s;ts, as if the&s;e were a retaliation for
&s;ome violences committed on their friends at the &s;urrender
of Reading. And under pretence of like retaliations, but
really from the extreme animo&s;ity of the parties, were &s;uch
irregularities continued during the whole cour&s;e, of the
war<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Clarendon, ubi &s;up. p. 297.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE lo&s;s, &s;u&s;tained by the royali&s;ts in the a&s;&s;ault
of Bri&s;tol, was con&s;iderable. Five hundred excellent &s;oldiers
peri&s;hed. Among tho&s;e of condition were Grandi&s;on, Slan|ning,
Trevannion, and Moyle: Bella&s;is, A&s;hley, and Sir
John Owen, were wounded: Yet was the &s;ucce&s;s, upon
<PB N="459" REF="533">
the whole, &s;o con&s;iderable as mightily elated the courage of
the one party, and depre&s;&s;ed that of the other. The King,
to &s;how that he was not intoxicated with good fortune, nor
a&s;pired to a total victory over the parliament, publi&s;hed a
manife&s;to, in which he renewed the prote&s;tation, formerly,
taken, with great &s;olemnity, at the head of his army, and
expre&s;&s;ed his firm intention of making peace upon the re|e&s;tabli&s;hment
of the con&s;titution. Having joined the camp
at Bri&s;tol, and &s;ent Prince Maurice with a detachment into
Devon&s;hire, he deliberated how to employ the remaining
forces in an enterprise of importance. Some propo&s;ed, and
&s;eemingly with great rea&s;on, to march directly to London;
where every thing was in great confu&s;ion, where the army
of the parliament was baffled, weakened, and di&s;mayed,
and where, it was hoped, either by an in&s;urrection, by vic|tory,
or by treaty, a &s;peedy end might be put, to the civil
di&s;orders. But this undertaking, by rea&s;on of the great
number and force of the London militia, was thought by
many to be attended with con&s;iderable difficulties. Glo|ce&s;ter,
lying within twenty miles, pre&s;ented an ea&s;ier, and
yet a very important conque&s;t. It was the only remaining
garri&s;on po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the parliament in tho&s;e parts. Could
that city be reduced, the King held the whole cour&s;e of the
Severn under his command; the rich and male-content
counties of the we&s;t, having lo&s;t all protection from their
friends, might be enforced to pay high contributions, as an
atonement for their di&s;affection; an open communication
could be pre&s;erved between Wales and the&s;e new conque&s;ts;
and half of the kingdom, being intirely freed from the
enemy, and thus united into one firm body, might be em|ployed
in re-e&s;tabli&s;hing the King's authority throughout the
remainder. The&s;e were the rea&s;ons for embracing, that re|&s;olution;
fatal, as it was ever e&s;teemed, to the royal party<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Whitlocke, p. 69. May, book iii. p. 91.</NOTE>.</P>

THE governor of Gloce&s;ter was one Ma&s;&s;ey,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Siege of Gloce&s;ter.</NOTE> a &s;oldier
of fortune, who, before he engaged with the parliament,
had offered his &s;ervice to the King; and as he was free from
the fumes of enthu&s;ia&s;m, by which mo&s;t of the officers on
that &s;ide were intoxicated, he would lend an ear, it was
pre&s;umed, to propo&s;als for accommodation. But Ma&s;&s;ey
was re&s;olute to pre&s;erve an intire fidelity to his ma&s;ters; and
though no enthu&s;ia&s;t him&s;elf, he well knew how to em|ploy

city and garri&s;on.<NOTE PLACE="marg">10th Aug.</NOTE> The &s;ummons to &s;urrender allowed two
hours for an answer: But before that time expired, there
appeared before the King two citizens, with lean, pale,
&s;harp, and di&s;mal vi&s;ages: Faces, &s;o &s;trange and uncouth,
according to Lord Clarendon; figures, &s;o habited and ac|coutered;
as at once moved the mo&s;t &s;evere countenances to
mirth, and the mo&s;t chear&s;ul hearts to &s;adne&s;s: It &s;eemed
impo&s;&s;ible that &s;uch amba&s;&s;adors could bring le&s;s than a,
de&s;iance. The men, without any circum&s;tance of duty or
good manners, in a pert, &s;hrill, undi&s;mayed accent, &s;aid,
that they brought an an&s;wer from the godly city of Glo|ce&s;ter:
And extremely ready were they, according to the
hi&s;torian, to give in&s;olent and &s;editious replies to any que&s;|tions;
as if their bu&s;ine&s;s were chiefly, by provoking the
King, to make him violate his own &s;afe conduct. The an|&s;wer
from the city was in the&s;e words:&startq;We the inhabit|ants,
magi&s;trates, officers and &s;oldiers, within the garri|&s;on

<PB N="461" REF="535">
was re&s;olutely undertaken by the army, and as re&s;olutely
&s;u&s;tained by the citizens and garrison.</P>
<P>WHEN intelligence of the &s;iege of Gloce&s;ter arrived in
London, the, con&s;ternation among the inhabitants was as
great as if the enemy were already at their gates. The ra|pid
progre&s;s of the royali&s;ts threatened the parliament with
immediate &s;ubjection: The factions and di&s;contents among
them&s;elves, in the city and throughout the neighbouring
counties, progno&s;ticated &s;ome dangerous divi&s;ion or in&s;ur|rection.
Tho&s;e parliamentary leaders, it mu&s;t be owned,
who had introduced &s;uch mighty innovations into the Eng|li&s;h
con&s;titution, and who had projected &s;o much greater,
had not engaged in an enter prize which had exceeded their
courage and capacity. Great vigour, from the beginning,
as well as wi&s;dom, they had di&s;played in all their coun&s;els;
and a furious, head&s;trong body, broke loo&s;e from the re|&s;traint
of law, had hitherto been retained in &s;ubjection
under their authority, and firmly united by zeal and pa&s;|&s;ion,
as by the mo&s;t legal and e&s;tabli&s;hed government. A
&s;mall committee, on whom the hou&s;es devolved their
power, had directed all their Coun&s;els, and had pre&s;erved a
&s;ecrecy in deliberation, and a promptitude in execution,
beyond what the King, notwith&s;tanding the advantages po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed
by a &s;ingle leader, had ever been able to attain. Sen|&s;ible
that no jealou&s;y was by their partizans entertained
again&s;t them, they had on all occa&s;ions exerted an authority
much more de&s;potic than the royali&s;ts, even during the
pre&s;&s;ing exigencies of war, could with patience endure in
their &s;overeign. Whoever incurred their di&s;plea&s;ure, or
was expo&s;ed to their &s;u&s;picion, was committed to pri&s;on,
and pro&s;ecuted under the notion of delinquency: After all
the old jails were full, many new ones were erected; and
even the &s;hips were crowded with the royali&s;ts, both gentry
and clergy, who langui&s;hed below decks, and peri&s;hed in
tho&s;e unhealthy confinements: They impo&s;ed taxes, the
<PB N="462" REF="536">
heavie&s;t, and of the mo&s;t unu&s;ual nature, by an ordinance
of the two hou&s;es: They voted a commi&s;&s;ion for &s;eqne&s;tra|tion;
and they &s;eized, where-ever they had power, the re|venues
of all the King's party<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">The King afterwards copied from this example; but, as the far greate&s;t part of the nobility and landed gentry were his friends, he reaped much le&s;&s; profit from this mea&s;ure.</NOTE>: And knowing that them|&s;elves,
and all their mini&s;ters, were, by re&s;i&s;ting the prince,
expo&s;ed to the penalties of law, they re&s;olved, with a fe|vere
admini&s;tration, to overcome the&s;e terrors, and retain
the people in obedience, by penalties of a more immediate
execution. In the beginning of this &s;ummer, a combina|tion,
formed again&s;t them in London, had obliged them
to exert the plenitude of their authority.</P>
<P>EDMOND WALLER, the fir&s;t refiner of Engli&s;h ver&s;ifi|cation,
was a member of the lower hou&s;e; a man of con|fiderable
fortune, and not more di&s;tingui&s;hed by his poetical
genius than by his parliamentary talents, and by the polite|ne&s;s
and elegance of his manners. As full of keen &s;atire
and invective in his eloquence, as of tenderne&s;s and pane|gyric
in his poetry, he caught the attention of his hearers,
and exerted the utmost boldne&s;s in blaming tho&s;e violent
coun&s;els by which the commons were governed. Finding
all oppo&s;ition within doors to be fruitle&s;s, he endeavoured to
form a party without, which might oblige the parliament
to accept of rea&s;onable conditions, and re&s;tore peace to the
nation. The charms of his conver&s;ation, joined to his, cha|racter
of courage and integrity, had procured him the in|tire
confidence of Northumberland, Conway, and every
eminent per&s;on of either &s;ex who re&s;ided in London. They
opened their brea&s;t to him without re&s;erve, and expre&s;&s;ed
their di&s;approbation of the furious methods pur&s;ued, by the
commons, and their wi&s;hes that &s;ome expedient could be
found for &s;topping &s;o impetuous a career. Tomkins, Wal|ler's
brother-in-law, and Chaloner, the intimate friend of
<PB N="463" REF="537">
Tomkins, had entertained like &s;entiments: and as the con|nexions
of the&s;e two gentlemen lay chiefly in the city, they
informed Waller, that the &s;ame abhorrence of war prevailed
there, among all men of rea&s;on and moderation. Upon
reflection, it &s;eemed not impraclicable that a combination
might be framed between the lords and citizens; and, by
mutual concert, the illegal taxes be refu&s;ed, which the par|liament,
without the royal a&s;&s;ent, impo&s;ed on the people.
While this affair was in agitation, and li&s;ts were forming of
&s;uch as they conceived to be well-affected to their de&s;ign;
a &s;ervant of Tomkins, who had overheard their di&s;cour&s;e,
immediately carried the intelligence to Pym. Waller, Tom|kins,
and Chaloner were &s;eized, and tried by a court-martial<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Ru&s;hworth, vol. vi. p. 326. Clarendon, vol. iii. p. 249, 250, &amp;c.</NOTE>.
They were all three condemned, and the two
latter executed on gibbets erected before their own doors.
A covenant, as a te&s;t, was taken<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">6th of June.</NOTE> by the lords and com|mons,
and impo&s;ed on their army and on all who lived
within their quarters. Be&s;ides re&s;olving to amend and re|form
their lives, the covenanters vow that they will never
lay down their arms &s;o long as the papi&s;ts, now in open war
again&s;t the parliament, &s;hall, by force of arms, be protected
again&s;t ju&s;tice; they expre&s;s their abhorrence of the late
con&s;piracy; and they promi&s;e to a&s;&s;i&s;t to. the Utmo&s;t the

King<NOTE N="w" PLACE="foot">Ru&s;h. vol. vi. p. 325. Clarendon, vol. ii. p. 255.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>WALLER, &s;o &s;oon as impri&s;oned, &s;en&s;ible of the great
danger into which he was fallen, was &s;o &s;eized with the
dread of death, that all his former &s;pirit de&s;erted him; and
he confe&s;&s;ed whatever he knew, without &s;paring his mo&s;t in|timate
friends, without regard to the confidence repo&s;ed in
him, without di&s;tigui&s;hing between the negligence of fa|miliar
conyer&s;ation and the &s;chemes of a regular con&s;piracy.
With the mo&s;t profound di&s;&s;imulation, he counterfeited
<PB N="464" REF="538">
&s;uch remor&s;e of con&s;cience, that his execution was put off,
out of mere chri&s;tian compa&s;&s;ion, till he might recover the
u&s;e of his under&s;tanding. He invited vi&s;its from the ruling
clergy of all &s;ects; and while he expre&s;&s;ed his own peni|tence,
he received their devout exhortations with humility
and reverence, as conveying clearer conviction and informa|tion
than in his life he had ever before attained. Pre&s;ents
too, of which, as well as of flattery, the&s;e holy men were
not in&s;en&s;ible, were di&s;tributed among them; as a &s;mall
retribution for their prayers and gho&s;tly coun&s;el. And by
all the&s;e artifices, more than from any regard to the beauty
of his genius, of which, during that time of furious cant
and faction, &s;mall account would be made, he prevailed &s;o
far as to have his life &s;pared, and a fine of ten thou&s;and
pounds accepted in lieu of it<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Whitlocke, p. 66. Ru&s;hworth. vol. vi. p. 330. Clarendon, vol. iii. p. 253, 254, &amp;c.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE &s;everity, exerci&s;ed again&s;t the con&s;piracy or rather
project of Waller, increa&s;ed the authority of the parlia|ment,
and &s;eemed to en&s;ure them again&s;t like attempts for
the future. But, by the progre&s;s of the King's arms, the
defeat of Sir William Waller, the taking of Bri&s;tol, the &s;iege
of Gloce&s;ter, a cry for peace was renewed, and with more
violence than ever. Crowds of women, with a petition
for that purpo&s;e, flocked about the hou&s;e, and were &s;o
clamorous and importunate, that orders were given for
di&s;per&s;ing them; and &s;ome of the females were killed in
the fray<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Ru&s;h. vol. vi. p. 357.</NOTE>. Bedford, Holland, and Conway, had de&s;erted
the parliament, and had gone to Oxford; Clare and Love|lace
had followed them<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Whitlocke, p. 67.</NOTE>. Northumberland had retired
to his country-&s;eat: E&s;&s;ex him&s;elf &s;hewed extreme di&s;&s;ati&s;|faction,
and exhorted the parliament to make peace<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Ru&s;h, vol. vi. p. 290.</NOTE>.
The upper hou&s;e &s;ent down terms of accommodation more
moderate than had hitherto been in&s;i&s;ted on. It even pa&s;&s;ed
by a majority among the commons, that the&s;e propo&s;als
<PB N="465" REF="539">
&s;hould be tran&s;mitted to the King. The zealots took the
alarm. A petition again&s;t peace was framed in the city,
and pre&s;ented by Pennington, the factious mayor. Multi|tudes
attended him, and renewed all the former menaces
again&s;t the moderate party<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Ru&s;h. vol. vi. p. 356.</NOTE>. The pulpits thundered, and
rumours were &s;pread of twenty thou&s;and Iri&s;h who had
landed, and were to cut the throats of every prote&s;tant<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Clarendon, vol. iii. p. 320. Ru&s;h. vol. vi. p. 588.</NOTE>.
The majority was again turned to the other &s;ide; and all
thoughts of pacification being laid a&s;ide, every preparation
was made for re&s;i&s;tance, and for the immediate relief of
Gloce&s;ter, on which, the parliament were &s;en&s;ible, all
their hopes of &s;ucce&s;s in the war did &s;o much depend.</P>
<P>MASSEY, re&s;olute to make a vigorous defence, and hav|ing
under his command a city and garri&s;on ambitious of
the crown of martyrdom, had hitherto maintained the
&s;iege with courage and capacity, and had much retarded
all the advances of the King's army. By continual &s;allies,
he infe&s;ted them in their trenches, and gained &s;udden ad|vantages
over them: By di&s;puting every inch of ground,
he repre&s;&s;ed the vigour and alacrity of their courage; elated
by former &s;ucce&s;&s;es. His garri&s;on, however, was reduced
to the la&s;t extremity; and he failed not, from time to time,
to inform the parliament, that, unle&s;s &s;peedily relieved, he
&s;hould be nece&s;&s;itated, from the extreme want of provi&s;ions
and ammunition, to open his gates to the enemy.</P>
<P>THE parliament, in order to repair their broken condi|tion,
and put them&s;elves in a po&s;ture of defence, now
exerted to the utmo&s;t their power and authority. They
voted that an army &s;hould be levied under Sir William
Waller, whom, notwith&s;tanding his misfortunes, they loaded
with extraordinary care&s;&s;es. Having a&s;&s;ociated in their cau&s;e
the counties of Hertford, E&s;&s;ex, Cambridge, Norfolk, Su&s;folk,
Lincoln, Huntingdon, they gave the Earl of Manche&s;ter a
<PB N="466" REF="540">
commi&s;&s;ion to be general of the a&s;&s;ociation, and appointed.
an army to be levied under his command. But, above all,
they were intent that E&s;&s;ex's army, on which their whole
fortune depended, &s;hould be put in a condition of, marching
again&s;t the King. They afre&s;h excited their preachers to
furious declamations again&s;t the royal cau&s;e. They, even
employed the expedient of pre&s;&s;ing, tho' aboli&s;hed by a late
law, for which they liad &s;trenuou&s;ly contended<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Ru&s;hworth, vol. vi. p. 291.</NOTE>. And
they engaged the city to &s;end four regiments of its militia to
the relief of Glouce&s;ter. All &s;hops, in the mean while, they
ordered to be &s;hut; and every man expected, with the utmo&s;t
anxiety, the event of that important enterprise<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Idem ibid.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>ESSEX, carrying with him a well-appointed, army of
14000 men, took the road of Bedford and Leice&s;ter; and,
though inferior in cavalry, yet, by the mere force of conduct
and di&s;cipline, he pa&s;&s;ed over tho&s;e open champaign coun|tries,
and defended him&s;el&s; from the enemy's hor&s;e, who had
advanced to meet him, and who infe&s;ted him during his
whole march. As he approached to Gloce&s;ter, the King was
obliged to rai&s;e the &s;iege, and open the way for E&s;&s;ex to enter
into that city. The nece&s;&s;ities of the garri&s;on were extreme.
One barrel of powder was their whole &s;tock of ammuni|tion.
remaining; and their other provi&s;ions were in the &s;ame,
proportion. E&s;&s;ex had brought with him military &s;tores;
and the neighbouring country abundantly &s;upplied him with
victuals of every kind. The inhabitants had carefully con|cealed
all provi&s;ions from the King's army, and, pretending
to be quite exhau&s;ted, had re&s;erved their &s;tores for that
cau&s;e which they &s;o much favoured<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Clarendon, vol. iii. p. 344.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE chief difficulty &s;till remained. E&s;&s;ex dreaded a
battle with the King's army, on account of their great &s;upe|riority
of hor&s;e; and he re&s;olved to return, if po&s;&s;ible, with|out
running that hazard. He lay five days at Tewke&s;bury,
<PB N="467" REF="541">
which was his fir&s;t &s;tage after leaving Gloce&s;ter; and he
feigned, by &s;ome preparations, to point towards Worce&s;ter.
By a forced march, during the night, lie reached Cirence&s;|ter,
and obtained the double advantage of pa&s;&s;ing unmole&s;ted
an open country, and of &s;urpri&s;ing a convoy of provi&s;ions
which lay in that town<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Ru&s;h. vol. vi. p. 292.</NOTE>. Without delay, he proceeded to|wards
London; but, when he reached Newbury, he was
&s;urpri&s;ed to find that the King, by ha&s;ty marches, had ar|rived
before him, and was already po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of that place.</P>
<P>AN action was now unavoidable;<NOTE PLACE="marg">20th Sept.</NOTE> and E&s;&s;ex prepared for
it with pre&s;ence of mind,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Battle of Newbury.</NOTE> and not without military conduct.
On both fides the battle was fought with de&s;perate valour
and a &s;teddy bravery. E&s;&s;ex's hor&s;e were &s;everal times broke
by the King's, but his infantry maintained them&s;elves infirm
array; and, be&s;ides giving a continued fire, they pre&s;ented
an invincible rampart of pikes again&s;t the furious impul&s;e
of Prince Rupert, and tho&s;e gallant, troops of gentry of
which the royal cavalry was chiefly compo&s;ed, The Lon|don
militia e&s;pecially, though utterly unacquainted with
action, though drawn but a few days before from their or|dinary
occupations, yet, having exactly learned all military
exerci&s;es, and being animated with unconquerable zeal for
the cau&s;e in, which they were engaged, equalled, on this
occa&s;ion, what could be expected from the mo&s;t veteran
forces. While the armies were engaged with the utmo&s;t
ardour, night put an end to the action, and left the event
undecided. Next morning, E&s;&s;ex proceeded on his march;
and though his rear was once put into &s;ome di&s;order by an
incur&s;ion of the King's hor&s;e, he reached London in &s;afety,
and received de&s;erved applau&s;e for his conduct and &s;ucce&s;s
in the whole enterprize. The King followed him on his
march; and having taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Reading, after the
Earl left it, he there e&s;tabli&s;hed a garri&s;on; and &s;trait|ened

<P>IN the battle of Newbury, on the part of the King, be|fides
the Earls of Sunderland and Carnarvon, two noblemen
of promi&s;ing, hopes, was unfortunately &s;lain, to the great
regret of every lover of ingenuity and virtue throughout
the kingdom, Lucius Cary, Lord Vi&s;count Falkland, fecre|tary
of &s;late. Before a&s;&s;embling the pre&s;ent parliament,
this man, devoted to the pur&s;uits of learning, and to the
&s;ociety of all the polite and elegant, had enjoyed him&s;elf in
every plea&s;ure, which a fine genius, a generous di&s;po&s;ition,
and an opulent fortune could afford. Called into public
Life, he &s;tood foremo&s;t in all attacks on the exorbitant pre|rogative
of the crown; and di&s;played that ma&s;culine elo|quence,
and undaunted love of liberty, which, from his
intimate acquaintance with the &s;ublime &s;pirits of antiquity,
he had greedily imbibed. When civil convulsions proceeded
to extremity, and it became requisite for him to choose his
side; he tempered the ardour of his zeal, and embraced the
defence of those limited powers which remained to mon|archy,
and which he deemed nece&s;&s;ary for the &s;upport of
the English constitution. Still anxious, however, for his
country, he &s;eems to have dreaded the too pro&s;perous &s;ucce&s;s
of his own party as much as of the enemy; and, among
his intimate friends, often, after a deep &s;ilence, and frequent
fighs, he would, with a fad accent, re-iterate the word,
<HI>Peace.</HI> In excu&s;e for the too free exposing of his person.
Which &s;eemed un&s;uitable in a &s;ecretary of &s;tate, he alleged,
that it become him to be more active than other men in all
hazardous enterprizes, left his impatatience for peace might
bear the imputation of cowardice or pu&s;illanimity. From
the commencemet of the war, his natural chearfulne&s;s and
vivacity became clouded; and even his u&s;ual attention to
<PB N="469" REF="543">
dre&s;s, required by his birth and &s;tation, gave way to a ne|gligence
which was ea&s;ily ob&s;ervable. On the morning of
the battle in which he Fell, he had &s;hown &s;ome care for
the adorning his per&s;on; and gave for a rea&s;on, that the
enemy &s;hould not find his body in any &s;lovenly, indecent
&s;ituation. &startq;I am weary,&endq; &s;ubjoined he, &startq;of the times,
and for&s;ee much mi&s;ery to my country; but believe, that
I &s;hall be out of it ere night<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Whitlocke, p. 70. Clarendon, vol. iii. p. 350, 351, &amp;c.</NOTE>.&endq; This excellent per&s;on
was but thirty-four years of age, when a period was put to
his life.</P>
<P>THE lo&s;s &s;u&s;tained on both &s;ides, in the battle of New|bury,
and the advanced &s;ea&s;on, obliged the armies to retire
into winter-quarters.</P>
<P>IN the north,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Actions in the north.</NOTE> during this &s;ummer, the great intere&s;t and
popularity of the Earl, now created Marquis of Newca&s;tle,
had rai&s;ed a very con&s;iderable force for the King; and great
hopes of &s;ucce&s;s were entertained from that quarter. There
appeared, however, in oppo&s;ition to him, two men, on
whom the event of the war finally depended, and who be|gan
about this time to be remarked for their valour and mi|litary
conduct. The&s;e were Sir Thomas Fairfax, &s;on to the
lord of that name, and Oliver Cromwel. The former
gained a con&s;iderable advantage at Wakefield<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">21&s;t of May.</NOTE> over a de|tachment
of royali&s;ts, and took General Goring pri&s;oner:
The latter obtained a victory at Gain&s;borow<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">31&s;t of July.</NOTE> over a party
commanded by the gallant Cavendi&s;h, who peri&s;hed in the
action. But both the&s;e defeats of the royali&s;ts were more
than &s;ufficiently compen&s;ated by the total rout of Lord
Fairfax at Atherton moor<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">30th of June.</NOTE>, and the di&s;per&s;ion of his whole
army. After this victory, Newca&s;tle, with an army of
15000 men, fat down before Hull. Hotham was no longer
governor of this place. That gentleman and his &s;on, partly
from a jealou&s;y of Lord Fairfax, partly repenting of
<PB N="470" REF="544">
their engagements again&s;t the King, had entered into a cor|re&s;pondence
with Newca&s;tle, and had expre&s;&s;ed an intention
of delivering Hull into his hands. But their con&s;piracy be|ing
di&s;covered, they were arre&s;ted and &s;ent pri&s;oners to
London; where, without any regard to their former &s;er|vices,
they fell, both of them, victims to the &s;everity of the
parliament<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Ru&s;h. vol. vi. p. 275</NOTE>.</P>
<P>NEW CASTLE, having carried on the attack of Hull for
&s;ome time, was beat off by a &s;ally of the garri&s;on<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">12th of October.</NOTE>, and
&s;uffered &s;o much, that he thought proper to rai&s;e the &s;iege.
About the &s;ame time, Manche&s;ter, who advanced from the
ea&s;tern a&s;&s;ociated counties, having joined Cromwel and
young Fairfax, obtained a con&s;iderable victory over the
royali&s;ts at Horn Ca&s;tle; where the two officers la&s;t-mentioned
gained great renown for their conduct and gallantry. And
though fortune had thus balanced her favours, the King's
party &s;till remained much &s;uperior in tho&s;e parts of Eng|land;
and had it not been for the garri&s;on of Hull, which
kept York&s;hire in awe, a conjunction of the northern forces
with the army in the &s;outh might have been made, and had
probably enabled the King, in&s;tead of entering on the un|fortunate,
perhaps imprudent, enterprize of Gloce&s;ter, to
march directly to London, and put an end to the war<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Warwick, p. 261. Walker, p. 278.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>WHILE the military enterprizes were carried on with
vigour in England, and the event became every day more
doubtful, both parties ca&s;t their eyes towards the neigh|bouring
kingdoms, and &s;ought a&s;&s;i&s;tance for the fini&s;hing
that enterprize, in which their own forces experienced &s;uch
furious oppo&s;ition. The parliament had recour&s;e to Scot|land;
the King, to Ireland.</P>
<P>WHEN the Scots covenanters obtained that end for which
they &s;o earne&s;tly contended, the e&s;tabli&s;hment of $word$
di&s;cipline in their own country, they were not &s;arisfied,
<PB N="471" REF="545">
but indulged &s;till an ardent pa&s;&s;ion of propagating, by all
methods, that mode of religion in the neighbouring king|doms.
Having flattered them&s;elves, in the fervor of their
zeal, that, by &s;upernatural a&s;&s;i&s;tances, they would be en|abled
to carry their triumphant covenant to the gates of
Rome it&s;elf, it behoved them fir&s;t to render it prevalent in
England, which already &s;howed &s;o great a di&s;po&s;ition to re|ceive
it. Even in the articles of pacification, they expre&s;&s;ed
a de&s;ire of uniformity in wor&s;hip with England; and the
King, employing general expre&s;&s;ions, had approved of this
inclination, as pious and laudable. No &s;ooner was there any
appearance of a rupture, than the Engli&s;h parliament, in
order to allure that nation into a clo&s;e con&s;ederacy, openly
declared their wi&s;hes of eccle&s;ia&s;tical reformation, and of
imitating the example of their northern brethren<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Ru&s;h. vol. vi. p. 3$0. Clasendon, vol. iii. p. 68.</NOTE>. When
war was actually commenced, the &s;ame artifices were u&s;ed;
and the Scots beheld, with the utmo&s;t impatience, a &s;cene
of action of which they could not deem them&s;elves indif|ferent
&s;pectators. Should the King, they &s;aid, be able, by
force of arms, to prevail over the parliament of England,
and re-e&s;tabli&s;h his authority in that powerful kingdom, he
will undoubtedly retract all tho&s;e conce&s;&s;ions, which, with
&s;o many circum&s;tances of violence and indignity, the Scots
have extorted from him. Be&s;ides a &s;en&s;e of his own in|tere&s;t,
and a regard to royal power, which has been intirely
annihilated in this country; his very pa&s;&s;ion for prelacy and
for religious ceremonies mu&s;t lead him to invade a church
which he has ever been taught to regard as antichri&s;tian and
unlawful. Let us but con&s;ider who the per&s;ons are that
compo&s;e the factions now &s;o furiou&s;ly engaged in arms.
Does not the parliament con&s;i&s;t of tho&s;e very men who have
ever oppo&s;ed all war with Scotland, who have puni&s;hed the
authors of our oppre&s;&s;ions, who have obtained us the re|dre&s;s
of every grievance, and who, with many honourable
<GAP DESC="MISSING">
<PB N="474" REF="546">
being likewi&s;e denied this reque&s;t, they returned with ex|treme
di&s;&s;atisfaction to Edinburgh.</P>
<P>THE office of con&s;ervators of the peace was newly erected
in Scotland, in order to maintain the confederacy between
the two kingdoms; and the&s;e, in&s;tigated by the clergy,
were re&s;olved, &s;ince they could not obtain the King's con|&s;ent,
to &s;ummon, in his name, but by their own authority,
a convention of e&s;tates; and to bereave their &s;overeign of
this article, the only one which remained, of his preroga|tive.
Under colour of providing for national peace, en|dangered
by the neighbourhood of Engli&s;h armies, was a
convention called<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">22d of June.</NOTE>; an a&s;&s;embly, which, though it meets
with le&s;s &s;olemnity, has the &s;ame authority as a parliament,
in rai&s;ing money and levying forces. Hamilton, and his
brother the Earl of Laneric, who had been &s;ent into Scot|land,
in order to oppo&s;e the&s;e mea&s;ures, wanted either autho|rity
or &s;incerity; and pa&s;&s;ively yielded to the torrent. The
general a&s;&s;embly of the church met at the &s;ame time with
the convention, and exerci&s;ing an authority almo&s;t ab&s;olute
over the whole civil power, made every political con&s;idera|tion
yield to their theological zeal and prejudices.</P>
<P>THE Engli&s;h parliament were, at that time, fallen into
great di&s;tre&s;s, by the progre&s;s of the King's arms; and they
gladly &s;ent to Edinburgh commi&s;&s;ioners, with ample powers,
to treat of a nearer union and confederacy with the Scots
nation. The per&s;ons employed were the Earl of Rutland,
Sir William Armyne, Sir Henry Vane the younger, Thomas
Hatcher, and Henry Darley, attended with Mar&s;hal and
Nye, two clergymen of &s;ignal authority<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Whitlocke, p. 73. Ru&s;h. vol. vi. p. 466. Cla|rendon, vol. iii. p. 300.</NOTE>. In this negotia|tion,
the man chiefly tru&s;ted to was Vane, who, in elo|quence,
addre&s;s, capacity, as well as in art and di&s;&s;imula|tion,
was not &s;urpa&s;&s;ed by any one, even during that age,
&s;o famous for active talents.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Solemn league and covenant.</NOTE> By his per&s;ua&s;ion was framed
at Edinburgh that SOLEMN LEAGUE AND COVENANT;
<PB N="475" REF="547">
which effaced all the former prote&s;tations and vows taken in
both kingdoms; and long maintained its credit and autho|rity.
By this covenant, the &s;ub&s;cribers, be&s;ides engaging
mutually to defend each other again&s;t all opponents, bound
them&s;elves to endeavour, without re&s;pect of per&s;ons, the
extirpation of popery and prelacy, &s;uper&s;tition, here&s;y,
&s;chi&s;m, and profanene&s;s; to maintain the rights and privi|leges
of parliaments, together with the king's authority; and
to di&s;cover and bring to ju&s;tice all incendiaries and malig|nants<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Ru&s;h. vol. vi. p. 4$8. Clarendon, vol. iii. p. 373.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE &s;ub&s;cribers to the covenant vowed al&s;o to pre&s;erve
the reformed religion e&s;tabli&s;hed in the church of Scotland;
but by the artifice of Vane no declaration more explicit|was
made with regard to England and Ireland, than that
the&s;e kingdoms &s;hould be reformed, according to the word
of God and the example of the pure&s;t churches. The Scots
zealots, when prelacy was abjured, deemed this expre&s;&s;ion
quite free from ambiguity, and regarded their own model
as the only one which corre&s;ponded, in any degree, to &s;uch
a de&s;cription: But that able politician had other views; and
while he employed his great talents in over-reaching the
pre&s;byterians, and &s;ecretly laughed at their &s;implicity, he
had blindly devoted him&s;elf to the maintenance of &s;y&s;tems
&s;till more ab&s;urd and more dangerous.</P>
<P>IN the Engli&s;h parliament there remained &s;ome members,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sept. 17.</NOTE> who, tho' they had been induced, either by private ambi|tion
or by zeal for civil liberty, to concur with the majority,
&s;till retained an attachment to the hierarchy and to the an|tient
modes of wor&s;hip. But in the pre&s;ent danger, which
threatened their cau&s;e, all &s;cruples were laid a&s;ide; and the
covenant, by who&s;e means alone they could expect to ob|tain
&s;o con&s;iderable a reinforcement as the acce&s;&s;ion of the
whole Scots nation, was received without oppo&s;ition. The
parliament, therefore, having fir&s;t &s;ub&s;cribed it them&s;elves,
ordered it to be received by all who lived under their au|thority.

GREAT were the rejoicings among the Scots,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Arming of the Scots.</NOTE> that they
&s;hould be the happy in&s;truments of extending their mode
of religion, and di&s;&s;ipating that profound darkne&s;s in which
their neighbouring nations were involved. The general
a&s;&s;embly applauded this glorious imitation of the piety di&s;|played
by their ance&s;tors, who, they &s;aid, by three different
applications, during the reign of Elizabeth, had endeavoured
to engage the Engli&s;h, by per&s;ua&s;ion, to lay a&s;ide the u&s;e
of the &s;urplice, tippet, and corner-cap<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Ru&s;hworth, vol. vi. p. 388.</NOTE>. The convention
too, in the height of their zeal, ordered every one to &s;wear
to this covenant, under the penalty of confi&s;cation, be&s;ide
what farther puni&s;hment it &s;hould plea&s;e the en&s;uing par|liament
to inflict on the refu&s;ers, as enemies to God, to the
king, and to the kingdom. And being determined that the
&s;word &s;hould carry conviction to all refractory minds, they
prepared them&s;elves, with great vigilance and activity, for
their military enterprizes. By means of a hundred thou|&s;and
pounds, which they received from England; by the
hopes of good pay and warm quarters; not to mention
mens favourable di&s;po&s;ition towards the cau&s;e; they &s;oon
completed their levies. And having added, to their other
levies, the troops which they had recalled from Ireland,
they Were ready, about the end of the year, to enter Eng|land,
under the command of their old general, the Earl of
Leven, with an army of above twenty thou&s;and men<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Clarendon, vol. iii. p. 383.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE King, fore&s;eeing this tempe&s;t which was gathering
upon him, endeavoured to &s;ecure him&s;elf by every expe|dient;
and he ca&s;t his eye towards Ireland, in hopes that that
kingdom, from which his cau&s;e had already received &s;o
much prejudice, might at la&s;t contribute &s;omewhat towards
his protection and &s;ecurity.</P>
<P>AFTER the commencement of the Iri&s;h in&s;urrection,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">State of Ireland.</NOTE> the Engli&s;h parliament, though they undertook the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion,
of it, had ever been too much engaged, either in military
projects or expeditions at home, to take any effectual &s;tep
<PB N="477" REF="551">
towards the fini&s;hing that enterprize. They had entered
indeed into a contract with the Scots, for &s;ending over an
army of ten thou&s;and men into Ireland; and in order to
engage that nation into &s;uch-an undertaking, be&s;ide the
promi&s;e of pay, they agreed to put Carickfergus into their
hands, and to inve&s;t their general with an authority quite
independent of the Engli&s;h government. The&s;e troops, &s;o
long as they were allowed to remain, were u&s;eful, by di|verting
the force of the Iri&s;h rebels, and protecting in the
north the &s;mall remnants of the Briti&s;h planters. But ex|cept
this contract with the Scots nation, all the other mea|&s;ures
of the parliament were hitherto either ab&s;olutely in&s;ig|nificant,
or tended rather to the prejudice of the prote&s;tant
cau&s;e in Ireland. By continuing their violent per&s;ecution,
and &s;till more violent menaces again&s;t prie&s;ts and papi&s;ts,
they rendered the Iri&s;h catholics ob&s;tinate in their rebellion,
and cut off all hopes of indulgence and toleration. By
di&s;po&s;ing beforehand of all the Iri&s;h forfeitures to &s;ub|&s;cribers
or adventurers, they rendered all men of property
de&s;perate, and &s;eemed to threaten a total extirpation of the
natives. And while they thus infu&s;ed &s;pirit and animo&s;ity
into the enemy, no mea&s;ure was pur&s;ued, which could tend
to &s;upport or encourage the prote&s;tants, now reduced to
the la&s;t extremity.</P>
<P>So great is the a&s;cendant, which, from a long cour&s;e of
&s;ucce&s;&s;es, the Engli&s;h has acquired over the Iri&s;h nation,
that though the latter, when they receive military di&s;cipline
among foreigners, are not &s;urpa&s;&s;ed by any troops, they have
never, in their own country, been able to make any vigo|rous
effort for the defence or recovery of their liberties.
In many rencounters, the Engli&s;h, under Lord More, Sir
William St, Leger, Sir Frederick Hamilton, and others
had, though under great di&s;advantages of &s;ituation and
numbers, put the Iri&s;h to rout, and returned in triumph
to Dublin. The rebels rai&s;ed the &s;iege of Tredah, after
<PB N="478" REF="552">
an ob&s;tinate defence made by the garri&s;on<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Ru&s;hworth, vol. vi. p. 506.</NOTE>. Ormond had
obtained two complete victories, at Kilru&s;h and Ro&s;s; and
had brought relief to all the forts which were be&s;ieged or
blockaded in different parts of the kingdoma<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Idem ibid. p. 512.</NOTE>. But not|with&s;tanding
all the&s;e &s;ucce&s;&s;es, even the mo&s;t common ne|ce&s;&s;aries
of life were wanting to the victorious armies. The
Iri&s;h, in their wild rage again&s;t the Briti&s;h planters, had
laid wa&s;te the whole kingdom, and were them&s;elves totally
unfit, from their barbarous &s;loth and ignorance, to rai&s;e
any convenience of human life. During the cour&s;e of &s;ix
months, no &s;upplies had come from England; except the
fourth part of one &s;mall ve&s;&s;el's lading. Dublin, to &s;ave
it&s;elf from &s;tarving, had been obliged to &s;end the greate&s;t
part of its inhabitants to England. The army had little
ammunition, &s;carce exceeding forty barrels of powder; not
even &s;hoes or cloaths; and for want of food, the cavalry
had been obliged to eat their own hor&s;es. And though the
di&s;tre&s;&s;es of the Iri&s;h were not much inferior<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Idem ibid. p. 555.</NOTE>; be&s;ides
that they were more hardened again&s;t &s;uch extremities, it
was but a melancholy pro&s;pect, that the two nations, while
they continued their furious animo&s;ities, &s;hould make de&s;o|late
that fertile i&s;land, which might &s;erve to the &s;ub&s;i&s;tence
and happine&s;s of both.</P>
<P>THE ju&s;tices and council of Ireland had been engaged,
chiefly by the intere&s;t and authority of Ormond, to fall into
an intire dependence on the King. Par&s;ons, Temple, Lof|tus,
and Meredith, who &s;eemed to incline towards the op|po&s;ite
party, had been removed; and Charles had &s;upplied
their place by others better affected to his &s;ervice. A com|mittee
of the Engli&s;h hou&s;e of commons, which had been
&s;ent over to Ireland, in order to conduct the affairs of that
kingdom, had been excluded the council, in obedience to
orders tran&s;mitted from the King<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Idem ibid. p. 530. Clarendon, vol. iii. p. 167.</NOTE>. And the&s;e were rea|&s;ons
&s;ufficient, be&s;ides the great difficulties under which they
them&s;elves laboured, why the parliament were unwilling, to
<PB N="479" REF="553">
&s;end &s;upplies to an army, which, though engaged in a
cau&s;e they much favoured, was intirely governed by their
declared enemies.</P>
<P>THE King, as he had neither money, arms, ammuni|tion,
nor provi&s;ions to &s;pare from his own urgent wants,
re&s;olved to embrace an expedient, which might at once re|lieve
the nece&s;&s;ities of the Irif&s;h prote&s;tants, and contribute
to the advancement of his affairs in England. A ce&s;&s;ation
with the rebels, he thought, would enable his &s;ubjects in
Ireland to provide for their own &s;upport, and procure him
the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the army again&s;t the Engli&s;h parliament.
But as a treaty with a people, &s;o odious for their religion and
their barbarities, might be repre&s;ented in very invidious co|lours,
and renew all tho&s;e calumnies with which he had
been loaded; it was nece&s;&s;ary to proceed with great caution
in conducting that mea&s;ure. A remon&s;trance from the
army was made to the Iri&s;h council, repre&s;enting their in|tolerable
nece&s;&s;ities, and craving permi&s;&s;ion to leave the
kingdom: And if that was refu&s;ed, <HI>We mu&s;t have recour&s;e,</HI>
they &s;aid, <HI>to that fir&s;t and primary law, with which God
has endowed all men; we mean the law of nature, which
teaches every creature to pre&s;erve it&s;elf</HI><NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Ru&s;h. vol. vi. p. 537.</NOTE>. Memorials both
to the King and parliament were tran&s;mitted by the ju&s;tices
and council, in which their wants and dangers are &s;trongly
&s;et forth<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Idem ibid. p. 538.</NOTE>; and though the general expre&s;&s;ions in the&s;e me|morials
might perhaps be &s;u&s;pected of exaggeration, yet,
from the particular facts mentioned, from the confe&s;&s;ion of
the Engli&s;h parliament<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Idem. ib. p. 540.</NOTE>; and from the very nature of
things, it is apparent, that the Iri&s;h prote&s;tants were reduced
to great extremities<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">See farther Carte's Ormond, vol. iii. N^o 113, 127, 128, 129, 134, 136, 141, 144, 149, 158, 159. All the&s;e papers put it pa&s;t doubt, that the nece&s;&s;ities of the Engli&s;h army in Ireland were extreme. See farther, Ru&s;h vol. vi. p. 527. and Dugdale, p. 853, 854.</NOTE>; and it became prudent in the King,
if not ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, to embrace &s;ome expedient,
<PB N="480" REF="554">
which might &s;ecure them, for a time, from the ruin and
mi&s;ery with which they were threatened.</P>
<P>ACCORDINGLY, the King gave orders<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">7th of September. See Ru&s;h. vol. vi. p. 537, 544, 547.</NOTE> to Ormond and
the ju&s;tices to conclude, for a year, a ce&s;&s;ation with the coun|cil
of Kilkenny, by whom the Iri&s;h were governed, and to
leave both &s;ides in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their pre&s;ent advantages.
The parliament who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s it was to find fault with
every mea&s;ure adopted by the oppo&s;ite party, and who would
not lo&s;e &s;o fair an opportunity of reproaching the King with
his favour to the Iri&s;h papi&s;ts, exclaimed loudly again&s;t this
ce&s;&s;ation. Among other rea&s;ons, they in&s;i&s;ted upon the di|vine
vengeance, which England might ju&s;tly dread for tole|rating
antichri&s;tian idolatry, on pretence of civil contracts
and political agreements<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Idem&punc; ib. p. 557.</NOTE>. Religion, though every day
employed as the engine of their own ambitious purpo&s;es,
was &s;uppo&s;ed too &s;acred to be yielded up to the temporal
intere&s;ts or &s;afety of kingdoms.</P>
<P>AFTER the ce&s;&s;ation, there was little nece&s;&s;ity, as well as
no means, of &s;ub&s;i&s;ting the army in Ireland. The King or|dered
Ormond, who was intirely devoted to him, to &s;end
over con&s;iderable bodies of it to England. Mo&s;t of them
continued in his &s;ervice: But a &s;mall part of them, having
imbibed in Ireland a high animo&s;ity again&s;t the catholics,
and hearing the King's party univer&s;ally reproached with
popery, &s;oon after de&s;erted to the parliament.</P>
<P>SOME Iri&s;h catholics came over with the&s;e troops, and
joined the King's army, where they continued the &s;ame
cruelties and di&s;orders to which they had been accu&s;tomed<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Whitlocke, p. 78, 103.</NOTE>.
The parliament voted, that no quarter, in any action, &s;hould
ever be granted them: But Prince Rupert, by u&s;ing &s;ome
reprizals, &s;oon repre&s;&s;ed this inhumanity<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Ru&s;hworth, vol. vi. p. 685, 783.</NOTE>.</P>
