<P>THESE i&s;lands con&s;i&s;t of 1. The Ladrones. 2. The Japan I&s;lands. 3. The Philippine I&s;lands. 4. The Moluccas and Amboyna. 5. The Banda I&s;lands. 6. The I&s;lands of Celebes, Gilolo, Ceram, &amp;c. which &s;urround the Moluccas and Banda I&s;lands. 7. The Sunda I&s;lands, as Bor|neo, Sumatra and Java, and tho&s;e that lie to the ea&s;tward of Java, Bally, Lomboe, Timor, &amp;c. 8. The Maldiva I&s;lands. 9. The Nicobar I&s;lands. 10.

<P>The&s;e i&s;lands, about twelve in number, are &s;itu|ated in the Pacific Ocean, in the 140&deg;. of ea&s;t

longitude, and between the 12th and 24th degree of north latitude. Guam, the large&s;t, is forty miles long, and twelve broad. The Spaniards have a fort, and a &s;mall garri&s;on of thirty or forty men in the chief town of the &s;ame name; and mo&s;t of their &s;hips touch there in their voyage from Aca|pulco in Mexico, to Manilla. The&s;e i&s;lands were fir&s;t di&s;covered by Magellan, in his voyage to the Spice I&s;lands, through the South-Sea, or Pacific Ocean, in 1521. They are remarkable for pro|ducing a fruit as big as a foot-ball, which yields a &s;oft pulp, like the crumb of a white loaf; and therefore called bread-fruit, by &s;eamen. Their &s;wift-&s;ailing &s;loops, called proas, which generally go twenty-four miles in an hour, is another peculi|arity: the voyage betwixt Guam and Manilla, in the Philippine I&s;lands, being twelve hundred miles, has been performed by them in four days. It was at the little but beautifully romantic i&s;land of Tinian, one of the&s;e Ladrones, that lord An&s;on fir&s;t touched, after pa&s;&s;ing the Pacific Ocean, in his voyage round the world. He found great re|fre&s;hment in it; the i&s;land, though uninhabited, abounding in cattle, fruits, and other nece&s;&s;aries.</P>

<HEAD>The JAPAN ISLANDS.</HEAD>
<P>The&s;e i&s;lands, which form the large and potent empire of that name, are &s;ituated on the mo&s;t ea&s;t|ern verge of A&s;ia, and con&s;i&s;t of three large, and a number of &s;maller i&s;lands, lying about an hundred leagues ea&s;tward of the coa&s;ts of China and Korea, and about 130 degrees ea&s;tward of London; &s;o that they have &s;un-ri&s;ing, noon, &amp;c. about eight hours before us. They extend from the 30th to the 41&s;t degree of latitude, and from the 130th to the 147th of ea&s;t longitude.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="40">
Were South and North Britain divided by an arm of the &s;ea, Japan might be mo&s;t aptly com|pared to England, Scotland, and Ireland, with their re&s;pective &s;maller i&s;lands, penin&s;ulas, bays, channels, &amp;c. all under the &s;ame monarch.</P>
<P>The Europeans call the empire Japan, but the inhabitants Niphon, from the greate&s;t i&s;land be|longing to it, and the Chine&s;e Siphon, probably on account of its ea&s;tern &s;ituation; the&s;e names &s;ig|nifying, in both languages, the Ba&s;is or Foundation of the Sun. It was fir&s;t di&s;covered by the Portu|gue&s;e, &s;ome time betwixt the years 1535 and 1548.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t of the i&s;lands which compo&s;e it are &s;ur|rounded with &s;uch high craggy mountains, and &s;uch &s;hallow and boi&s;terous &s;eas, that &s;ailing about them is extremely dangerous; and the creeks and bays are choaked up with &s;uch rocks, &s;helves, and &s;ands, that it looks as if Providence had de&s;igned it to be a kind of little world by it&s;elf. The&s;e &s;eas have likewi&s;e many dangerous whirlpools, which are very difficult to pa&s;s at low water, and will &s;uck in and &s;wallow up the large&s;t ve&s;&s;els, and all that comes within the reach of their vortex, da&s;hing them again&s;t the rocks at the bottom; in&s;omuch, that &s;ome of them are never &s;een again, and others thrown upon the &s;urface at &s;ome miles di&s;tance. Some of the&s;e whirlpools al&s;o make a noi&s;e terrible to hear.</P>
<P>The Chine&s;e pretend, that the Japan I&s;lands were fir&s;t peopled by them&s;elves; but it is more probable, that the original inhabitants were a mix|ture of different nations, driven thither by tho&s;e tempe&s;tuous &s;eas, and at different times; and this conjecture is confirmed by the great difference ob|&s;ervable between the pre&s;ent inhabitants, in regard to feature, complexion, &s;hapes, habits, cu&s;toms, and language, notwith&s;tanding their having been &s;o long united under one monarch.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="50">
As the&s;e i&s;lands lie in the fifth and &s;ixth climates, they would be much hotter in &s;ummer than Eng|land, were not the heats refre&s;hed by the winds, which continually blow from the &s;ea around them, and to which they are much expo&s;ed by the height of their &s;ituation: this circum&s;tance, however, not only renders their winters exce&s;&s;ive cold, but the &s;ea&s;ons more incon&s;tant. They have great falls of &s;now in winter, which are commonly followed by hard fro&s;ts. The rains in &s;ummer are very vio|lent, e&s;pecially in the months of June and July; which, on that account, are called Sat-Suki, or Water-Months. The country is al&s;o much &s;ub|ject to dreadful thunders and lightnings, as well as &s;torms and hurricanes, which frequently do a great deal of damage.</P>
<P>The &s;oil, though naturally barren and moun|tainous, by the indu&s;try of the inhabitants, not on|ly &s;upplies them with every nece&s;&s;ary of life, but al&s;o furni&s;hes other countries with them; pro|ducing, be&s;ides corn, the fine&s;t and white&s;t rice, and other grains, with a great variety of fruits, and va&s;t numbers of cattle of all &s;orts. Be&s;ides rice, and a &s;ort of wheat, and barley, with two &s;orts of beans, they have Indian wheat, millet, and &s;everal other kinds, in great abundance. Their &s;eas, lakes, and rivers, abound with fi&s;h; and their mountains, woods, and fore&s;ts, are well &s;tocked with hor&s;es, elephants, deer, oxen, buffaloes, &s;heep, hogs, and other u&s;eful animals. Some of their mountains al&s;o are enriched with mines of gold, &s;ilver, and copper, exqui&s;itely fine, be&s;ides tin, lead, iron, and various other minerals and fo&s;&s;ils; whil&s;t others abound with &s;everal &s;orts of marble, and precious &s;tones. Of the&s;e mountains, &s;ome may be ju&s;tly ranked among the natural rarities of this country; one, in particular, in the great i&s;land of Niphon, is of &s;uch a prodigious height as to be ea&s;ily &s;een
<PB N="7" REF="60">
forty leagues off at &s;ea, though its di&s;tance from the &s;hore is about eighteen. Some authors think, it exceeds the famous Peak of Teneriffe; but it may be rather called a clu&s;ter or group of moun|tains, among which are no le&s;s than eight dreadful vulcanoes, burning with incredible fury, and often laying wa&s;te the country round about them: but, to make &s;ome amends, they afford great variety of medicinal waters, of different degrees of heat; one of the&s;e, mentioned by Varenius, is &s;aid to be as hot as burning oil, and to &s;corch and con&s;ume every thing thrown into it.</P>
<P>The many brooks and rivers that have their &s;ources among the mountains, form a great num|ber of delightful ca&s;cades, as well as &s;ome dread|ful cataracts. Among the great variety of trees in the fore&s;ts here, the cedars exceed all of that kind through India, for &s;treightne&s;s, height, and beauty. They abound in mo&s;t of the i&s;lands, e&s;pe|cially the three large&s;t.</P>
<P>Their &s;eas, be&s;ides fi&s;h, furni&s;h them with great quantities of red and white coral, and &s;ome pearls of great value, be&s;ides a variety of &s;ea-plants and &s;hells; which la&s;t are not inferior to tho&s;e that are brought from Amboyna, the Molucca, and other Ea&s;tern i&s;lands.</P>
<P>The va&s;t quantity of &s;ulphur, with which mo&s;t of the Japan i&s;lands abound, makes them &s;ubject to frequent and dreadful earthquakes. The inhabi|tants are &s;o accu&s;tomed to them, that they are &s;carcely alarmed at any, unle&s;s they chance to be very ter|rible indeed, and lay whole towns in ruins, which very often proves the ca&s;e. On the&s;e occa&s;ions, they have recour&s;e to extraordinary &s;acrifices, and acts of wor&s;hip to their deities or daemons, ac|cording to the different notions of each &s;ect, and &s;ometimes even proceed to offer human victims; but, in this ca&s;e, they only take &s;ome of the vile&s;t
<PB N="8" REF="70">
and mo&s;t abandoned fellows they can meet with, becau&s;e they are only &s;acrificed to the malevolent deities.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to religion, that of the Japane&s;e is allowed, by all writers, to have been downright heatheni&s;m and idolatry, from time immemorial. They do not &s;eem &s;o much as to have any &s;ort of notion of a Supreme Being; but believe the world to have exi&s;ted from eternity, and that the gods they wor&s;hip were men, or beings, that lived on earth &s;everal thou&s;ands of years, and were afterwards, for their piety, mortification, and even by their voluntary death, rai&s;ed to that height of power and dignity they have ever &s;ince enjoyed. They are divided, however, into various &s;ects; probably, according to the various nations that fir&s;t &s;ettled there. One of them is called the fect of Siutto, which is that of their philo&s;ophers and morali&s;ts, who&s;e profe&s;&s;ors, like the Chine&s;e lite|rati, de&s;pi&s;e all notions of public wor&s;hip and po|pular &s;uper&s;tition. Every per&s;on here is at liberty to chu&s;e what &s;ect plea&s;es him be&s;t; no compul|&s;ion being u&s;ed by the government, or by the pa|rents. Mo&s;t of the &s;ects believe a future &s;tate, of bli&s;s or mi&s;ery; though they are not agreed about the nature and duration of it: the generality, howe|ver, think that it will con&s;i&s;t in a tran&s;migration of the &s;oul from one body to another, more or le&s;s excellent and happy, according to their behaviour in their late &s;tate; and that this revolution will continue, as well as the world, to eternal ages. All the different &s;ects, or at lea&s;t the prie&s;ts and prie&s;te&s;&s;es of them, however divided in other re&s;pects, agree in regard|ing the five following negative precepts, as ab&s;o|lutely binding; viz. 1. Not to kill, nor to eat any thing that is killed; 2. Not to &s;teal; 3. Not to de|file another man's bed; 4. Not to lye; 5. Not to drink wine. From the example of their two chief
<PB N="9" REF="80">
deities, Amida and Xaca, the Japane&s;e have a no|tion of its being &s;uch a merritorious thing to di&s;|patch one's &s;elf, that great numbers of them em|brace, in the mo&s;t public manner, a voluntary death; either by drowning, hanging, or flinging them&s;elves down from a precipice, or by poi&s;on, dagger, or any other quick riddance. The fol|lowers of Xaca commonly drown them&s;elves; but tho&s;e of Amida &s;hut them&s;elves up in &s;ome clo&s;e, confined place, where they have ju&s;t room to &s;it, and, being immured on every &s;ide, have only a little hole to breathe through, by means of a &s;mall cane, and never cea&s;e calling on that deity, till they expire.</P>
<P>There is not a country in all the Ea&s;t that abounds more with temples and mona&s;teries than this: not only cities and towns, but plains and mountains, and even de&s;erts, &s;warm with them; for the prie&s;ts here, like tho&s;e of the church of Rome, are either &s;ecular or regular. The former live in private hou&s;es of their own, allow them&s;elves one or two wives, and live on the income and of|ferings made to their re&s;pective temples and deities, and are at their own liberty as to the practice of ab|&s;tinence, and other &s;everities: the regulars live in communities, under their re&s;pective &s;uperiors, and lead more or le&s;s reclu&s;e and au&s;tere lives, according to their &s;ects. Some of the mona&s;teries contain a thou|&s;and, or even more of them, who, be&s;ides a perpetual celibacy, and other mortifications, are all bound to ob&s;erve the five rules before mentioned. Both &s;ecular and regular are under the government of the dairo, or high-prie&s;t, who is the head of all the religions and &s;ects in the empire. Be&s;ides the multitude of idols in their temples, there is a great number of others &s;et up in their other public buildings, in their piazzas and markets, &s;treets, and even public roads.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="90">
The Japane&s;e have as great variety of fe&s;tivals, as of &s;ects and deities, which it would therefore be endle&s;s to de&s;cribe: they con&s;i&s;t, in general, in the anniver&s;ary of their gods, and of their dead rela|tions.</P>
<P>Chri&s;tianity, if popery de&s;erves that name, had once made a con&s;iderable progre&s;s in this country; but, about the year 1022, a dreadful per&s;ecution was rai&s;ed again&s;t the mi&s;&s;ionaries, and all that ad|hered to them, occa&s;ioned partly by the indi&s;creet zeal of the former, partly by the jealou&s;y of the unconverted nobles, but e&s;pecially of the Japane&s;e prie&s;ts, who could not, without the greate&s;t envy and regret, behold their old religion, with all its powerful attractives of profit, popular e&s;teem, and re&s;pect daily lo&s;ing ground; but, more particu|larly, by the policy and treachery of the Dutch, who found effectual means to undermine them. All the Chri&s;tian converts were put to death; and the Europeans, except the Dutch, forbid to come within the Japane&s;e dominions, under the &s;evere&s;t penalties.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the government of the&s;e i&s;lands, it is, and has been for a long time, monarchical; though formerly it &s;eems to have been &s;plit into a great number of petty kingdoms, which were, at length, all &s;wallowed by one. The imperial dig|nity had been enjoyed, for a con&s;iderable time be|fore the year 1500, by a regular &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of princes, under the title of dairos, a name &s;uppo&s;ed to have been derived from Dairo, the head of that family. Soon after that epoch, &s;uch a dreadful civil war broke out, and la&s;ted &s;o many years, that the empire was quite ruined. During the&s;e di&s;tractions and confu&s;ions, a common &s;oldier, by name Tayc|koy, a per&s;on of ob&s;cure birth, but of an enter|prizing genius, found means to rai&s;e him&s;elf to the imperial dignity; having, in little more than three
<PB N="11" REF="100">
years time, by an uncommon &s;hare of good fortune and &s;ucce&s;s, &s;ubdued all his competitors and op|ponents, and reduced all their cities and ca&s;tles. The dairo, not being in a condition to ob&s;truct or put a &s;top to his progre&s;s, was forced to &s;ubmit to his terms; and might perhaps have been condemn|ed to much harder, had not Tayckoy been appre|hen&s;ive le&s;t his &s;oldiers, who &s;till revered their an|tient natural monarch, &s;hould have revolted in his favour. To prevent this, he granted him the &s;u|preme power in all religious matters, with great privileges, honours, and revenues annexed to it; whil&s;t him&s;elf remained inve&s;ted with the whole ci|vil and military power, and was acknowledged and proclaimed king of Japan. This great revolution happened in 1517, and Tayckoy reigned &s;everal years with great wi&s;dom and tranquillity; during which, he made many whole&s;ome laws and regu|lations, which &s;till &s;ub&s;i&s;t, and are much admired to this day. At his death, he left the crown to his &s;on Taycko&s;&s;amma, then a minor; but the treache|rous prince under who&s;e guardian&s;hip he was left, deprived him of his life, before he came of age. By this murder, the crown pa&s;&s;ed to the family of Jeja&s;&s;ama, in which it &s;till continues. Tayckoy and his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors have contented them&s;elves with the title of cubo, which, under the dairos, was that of prime mini&s;ter, who&s;e office is now &s;up|pre&s;&s;ed; &s;o that the cubo, in all &s;ecular concerns, is quite as ab&s;olute and de&s;potic, and has as exten&s;ive a power over the lives and fortunes of all his &s;ub|jects, from the petty kings down to the lowe&s;t per|&s;ons, as ever the dairos had. The dairo re&s;ides con&s;tantly at Meaco, and the cubo at Jedo.</P>
<P>The Japane&s;e traffic with the Chine&s;e, Koreans, and people of Jetzo; but, of the European nations, the Dutch alone are &s;uffered to trade with them, hav|ing declared, as &s;ome &s;ay, after the expul&s;ion of the
<PB N="12" REF="110">
Portugue&s;e, that they were no Chri&s;tians; but more probably on the merit of &s;upplanting, and a&s;&s;i&s;ting in expelling the Portugue&s;e: for it is im|po&s;&s;ible that the Japane&s;e can be ignorant that the Dutch profe&s;s Chri&s;tianity, as they trade to China; and we find the Japane&s;e u&s;e as much cau|tion in their commerce with the Dutch, as if they were really Chri&s;tians:</P>
<P>At the &s;ea&s;on that the Dutch fleet is expected, the governor of Nanga&s;aque places centinels on the hills to give notice of the approach of any &s;hips. When they appear, a boat is &s;ent off to every-&s;hip, with a waiter or officer, and as &s;oon as the &s;hips come to an anchor, an expre&s;s is imme|ately di&s;patched to court, before who&s;e return, the Dutch may not di&s;po&s;e of any thing. In the mean time the particulars of every &s;hip's cargo are taken, with the name, age, &s;tature, and office of every man on board, which is tran&s;lated and printed in the Japane&s;e language. When the expre&s;s is re|turned, the &s;hips crew are permitted to come on &s;hore, and are all mu&s;tered before a Japane&s;e com|mi&s;&s;ary; and every per&s;on is called over aloud, and made to give an account of his age, quality and office, to &s;ee if it agrees with the particulars given in by the Dutch; after this examination they are &s;ent on board again, and the &s;ails of the &s;hip, with the guns, arms, ammunition and helm, are brought on &s;hore, and the hatches &s;ealed down by a Japane&s;e officer; nor can they be opened, whatever the &s;hips crew may want, without a per|mi&s;&s;ion from the governor, who always &s;ends a per&s;on to &s;ee what is taken out, and &s;eal them down again; nor dare the Dutch &s;ailors light a candle, or make any fire on board their &s;hips, any more than on &s;hore. The &s;hips are allowed no communication with one another; nor is any of|ficer or &s;ailor &s;uffered to go on &s;hore, except the
<PB N="13" REF="120">
per&s;ons who are appointed to carry the company's pre&s;ent to the king at Jedo or Yeddo. His ma|je&s;ty having accepted the pre&s;ent, and prepared another for the company, the Dutch officer is con|veyed to Nanga&s;aque under a &s;trong guard as he came. This journey, and the tran&s;acting their mercantile affairs, u&s;ually take up about three months and a half.</P>
<P>The Dutch, who attend the king on this occa|&s;ion, approach him on their knees, with their hands joined together, and carried to their fore|heads, as the Japane&s;e governors and mini&s;ters al&s;o do.</P>
<P>While the Dutch &s;hips lie in the road, none of the Japane&s;e are allowed to go on board them to trade with the &s;ailors; and tho&s;e that carry pro|vi&s;ions on board, are not &s;uffered to take any mo|ney for them, till the permi&s;&s;ion to trade comes from court, and then they deliver in their accounts and are paid. After this the Japane&s;e permit &s;ix per&s;ons from every ve&s;&s;el to come on &s;hore, and buy and &s;ell for them&s;elves, and &s;tay four days, either in Di&s;nia, or in the city, as they &s;ee fit; when the&s;e &s;ix men return on board, &s;ix others are allowed to go on &s;hore, and traffic in the like man|ner, and &s;o on.</P>
<P>The goods are generally paid in bullion, or pieces of &s;ilver of ten or five crowns value, or &s;maller pieces by weight; for they have no coin, except &s;ome little pieces of copper.</P>
<P>After &s;ix weeks free trade, there is no further communication allowed of between the city of Nanga&s;aque, and the Dutch in the i&s;land of Di&s;nia, or with the &s;hipping, whereupon the fleet pre|pares to return, and the factory in Di&s;nia are con|fined to their little i&s;land again, 'till the &s;ea&s;on of the year for traffic returns.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="130">
With re&s;pect to the character of the Japane&s;e, they are generally very active, and of a quick ap|prehen&s;ion and good under&s;tanding, mode&s;t, pa|tient, and courteous, and excelling all the Orientals in docility. They are &s;o ju&s;t in their dealings, that one may ab&s;olutely depend on their word; and, contrary to the Chine&s;e, di&s;dain to take the lea&s;t ad|vantage of tho&s;e they deal with. They are all very indu&s;trious and labourious, and much given to &s;tudy and reading. They affect a &s;urpri&s;ing neatne&s;s and decency in their eating, drinking, fur|niture, dre&s;s, and conver&s;ation, and have an ab|horrence to intemperance, luxury, and defamation. Drunkenne&s;s and gluttony are as much dete&s;ted by the rich and poor, as cheating and di&s;hone&s;ty. This is the bright &s;ide of their character. On the other hand, they are repre&s;ented as proud, ambiti|ous, cruel, and uncharitable; and &s;o in&s;en&s;ible of the mi&s;eries of their fellow-creatures, that they will &s;uffer them to peri&s;h, rather than relieve them. They are likewi&s;e &s;aid to be &s;o pa&s;&s;ionate and re|vengeful, that they will make away with them|&s;elves, if they cannot find an opportunity of re|venging an affront. They allow not only of po|lygamy, but al&s;o of fornication: but there is &s;till a more heinous and unnatural vice laid to their charge, viz. that of &s;odomy, which is not only committed with impunity, both by prie&s;ts and laity, but without either brand or di&s;grace. In their wars they are very fierce and cruel, &s;eldom giving or a&s;king for quarter; and when a town is taken, they commonly de&s;troy it by fire and &s;word. Like the Chine&s;e, they are &s;o given to a&s;trology, that they &s;carce undertake any thing of moment, without con&s;ulting &s;ome pretender to that art. There is a va&s;t number of univer&s;ities di&s;per&s;ed all over the empire, in which the bonzas pre&s;ide, richly endowed, finely &s;ituated, and accommodated
<PB N="15" REF="140">
with all the conveniences of life, as well as with large libraries.</P>
<P>The Japane&s;e laws and puni&s;hments are &s;evere beyond all ju&s;tice, and may be ju&s;tly &s;aid, like tho&s;e of the Spartan Draco, to be written in blood. They have few, if any, written laws, the emperor's will being the &s;upreme one, and next to it that of the kings and princes in their re&s;pective dominions. The very lords of every di&s;trict, and even the heads of every family, have power of life and death over all that are under them, and try and condemn them, according to their will. There is &s;carcely any crime &s;o &s;mall, that is not puni&s;hed with death, except the offender be a petty king or prince, and even the&s;e are not always exempted. Every petty larceny, in&s;ult, detraction, cheating of any kind, even at play, a lie or prevarication be|fore a magi&s;trate, are all capital, as well as the more heinous crimes of trea&s;on, murder, parricide, ince&s;t, rape, adultery. Their mo&s;t common way of putting criminals to death, is by crucifixion with their heads downwards, boiling in oil, tearing them in pieces by hor&s;es, or cutting them in pieces by the hangman. For the highe&s;t crimes, not only the criminal, but his parents al&s;o, brothers, and even children, are all put to death. The Japane&s;e have but very little &s;kill in phy&s;ic and &s;urgery. In the cure of di&s;ea&s;es they depend much on their medicinal waters, and on certain roots and plants, particularly the root gin&s;eng, brought from China. The operation of blood|letting is performed by pricking the belly with a fine needle, made either of gold or &s;ilver. By this acupuncture they not only a&s;&s;uage, but effec|tually cure an endemic colickly di&s;order common among them, and called &s;henki. The other di&s;ea&s;es to which they are mo&s;t liable, are the drop&s;y, diarrhaea,
<PB N="16" REF="150">
&s;mall-pox, bloody flux; but the gout, &s;tone, and gravel, are hardly known among them.</P>
<P>The Japane&s;e are much addicted to poetry, mu&s;ic, and painting; the fir&s;t is &s;aid to be grand as to the &s;tyle and imagery, loftine&s;s and cadence; but, like that of the Chine&s;e, is not ea&s;ily under&s;tood, or reli&s;hed by the Europeans. The &s;ame may be &s;aid of their mu&s;ic, both vocal and in&s;trumental, the be&s;t of which, of either kind, would hardly be tolerable to a nice European car. They are better painters than the Chine&s;e, but much inferior to the Europeans; mo&s;t of their performances in that kind, are either in water|colours on paper, fine leather, &amp;c. or in their ja|paning, and fine porcelain-ware. What is mo&s;t to be admired in their paintings, is the &s;ingular beauty of the colours, in many of which they greatly exceed us.</P>
<P>They pretend, like the Chine&s;e, to have been the inventers of printing from time immemorial; and their method is the &s;ame with theirs on wooden blocks; but they exceed them in the neatne&s;s of cutting them, as well as in the goodne&s;s of their ink and paper. They likewi&s;e lay claim to the in|vention of gunpowder, are va&s;tly &s;uperior to the Chine&s;e in the u&s;e of all &s;orts of fire-arms, e&s;pe|cially of artillery, as well as the curiou&s;ne&s;s of their fireworks.</P>
<P>Their manner of writing is much the &s;ame as that of the Chine&s;e, viz. in columns from top to bottom, and the columns beginning at the right, and end|ing at the left hand. Their characters were al&s;o originally the &s;ame, but now differ con&s;iderably.</P>
<P>Their language hath &s;ome affinity with the Chine&s;e, tho' it appears from its various dialects to have been a kind of compound of that and other languages, derived from the various nations that fir&s;t peopled tho&s;e i&s;lands. It is not only very
<PB N="17" REF="160">
regular, polite, elegant, and copious, and abounds with a great variety of &s;ynonima, adapted to the nature of the &s;ubject they are upon, whether &s;ub|lime, familiar, or low; and to the quality, age and &s;ex, both of the &s;peaker and per&s;ons &s;poken to.</P>
<P>The Japane&s;e are commonly very ingenious in mo&s;t handicraft trades; and excel even the Chine&s;e in &s;everal manufactures, particularly in the beauty, goodne&s;s, and variety of their &s;ilks, cottons, and other &s;tuffs, and in their japan and porcelain wares. No ea&s;tern nation comes up to them in the temper|ing and fabricating of &s;cymitars, &s;words, mu&s;kets, and other &s;uch weapons.</P>
<P>The Japane&s;e architecture is much in the &s;ame ta&s;te and &s;tyle as that of the Chine&s;e, e&s;pecially as to their temples, palaces, and other public build|ings; but in private ones they affect more plain|ne&s;s and neatne&s;s than &s;how: the&s;e la&s;t being mo&s;tly built of wood, make their cities exceeding|ly liable to conflagrations, which, wherever they happen, generally reduce the greate&s;t part of them to a&s;hes, they having neither engines, nor any other method of &s;topping the progre&s;s of the flames. The gardens about their hou&s;es are a|dorned with a variety of flowers, trees, verdure, baths, terraces and other embelli&s;hments. The furniture and decorations of the hou&s;es of per&s;ons of di&s;tinction, con&s;i&s;t in japan-work of various colours, curious paintings, beds, couches, &s;creens, cabinets, tables, a variety of porcelain jars, va&s;es, tea-equipage, and other ve&s;&s;els and figures, together with &s;words, guns, &s;cymitars, and other arms. Their retinues are more or le&s;s numerous and &s;plen|did according to their rank; but there are few of the lords who have le&s;s than fifty or &s;ixty men richly clad and armed, &s;ome on foot, but mo&s;t on hor&s;eback. As for their petty kings and princes,
<PB N="18" REF="170">
they are &s;eldom &s;een without two or three hun|dred at lea&s;t, when they either wait on the em|peror, which is one half of the year, or attend him abroad. The Japane&s;e dre&s;s is much like that of the Chine&s;e, only &s;omewhat more elegant and neat, and mo&s;t commonly of &s;ilk or cotton. They wear nothing on their heads, either winter or &s;um|mer, tho' they &s;have them&s;elves clo&s;e all over, ex|cept one lock, which is left hanging on the top by way of ornament; but to guard them&s;elves from &s;un or rain, they always carry an umbrella in one hand; and, if rich enough, have them held over their heads by a &s;ervant. The poorer &s;ort have in&s;tead of that, either a fan or &s;hort &s;creen. The women of fa&s;hion, e&s;pecially the young ones, adorn them&s;elves with flowers, feathers, pearls, &amp;c. but are &s;eldom &s;een abroad, or even at home, to any but tho&s;e of the family, without a veil.</P>
<P>The proper colour here for fe&s;tivals is black, for mourning white. In&s;tead of ri&s;ing at the approach of a &s;uperior, they &s;et them&s;elves down, and in|&s;tead of bowing or pro&s;trating, when they &s;alute, they &s;tand upright. They chu&s;e to have their teeth and nails of a &s;hining black, and to let the latter grow to an exce&s;&s;ive length. The chief food of the Japane&s;e is rice, pul&s;e, fruits, roots, herbs, eating very little fle&s;h, and that only of &s;uch bea&s;ts as they take in hunting. In&s;tead of knives, forks, and &s;poons, they make u&s;e of the &s;ame &s;orts of &s;mall &s;ticks as the Chine&s;e. Their common drink is either water or tea; but they have other liquors, &s;ome di&s;tilled from rice or wheat, others made of their grains, boiled with &s;ugar or honey, or of fruits, or tapped from the palm, birch, and other trees.</P>
<P>After marriage, the wife is con&s;igned to her own apartment, from whence &s;he hardly ever &s;tirs, except once a year to the funeral rites of her family;
<PB N="19" REF="180">
nor is &s;he permitted to &s;ee any man, except per|haps &s;ome very near relation, and that as &s;eldom as can be. The wives, as well as in China, and other parts of the Ea&s;t, bring no portion with them, but are rather bought by the hu&s;band of their parents and relations. The bridegroom mo&s;t commonly &s;ees his bride for the fir&s;t time, upon her being brought to his hou&s;e from the place of the nuptial ceremony: for in the temple where it is performed &s;he is covered over with a veil, which reaches from the head to the feet. A hu&s;|band can put his wives to a more or le&s;s &s;evere death, if they give him the lea&s;t cau&s;e of jealou&s;y, by being &s;een barely to conver&s;e with another man, or &s;uffering any of them to come into their apart|ment.</P>
<P>The Japane&s;e, both poor and rich, make an annual proce&s;&s;ion to the &s;epulchres of their dead relations, with &s;ongs and mu&s;ic, carrying money, victuals, cloathing, &amp;c. as pre&s;ents to relieve their various wants in the other world.</P>
<P>When a prince or great man dies, there are com|monly about ten, twenty, or more youths of his hou&s;hold, and &s;uch as were his greate&s;t favour|ites, who put them&s;elves to a voluntary death, at the place where the body is buried or burn|ed: as &s;oon as the funeral pile, con&s;i&s;ting of odoriferous woods, gums, &s;pices, oils, and other ingredients is &s;et on fire, the relations and friends of the decea&s;ed throw their pre&s;ents into it, &s;uch as cloaths, arms, victuals, money, &s;weet herbs, flowers, and other things, which they imagine will be of u&s;e to him in the other world. Tho&s;e of the middle or lower rank commonly bury their dead, without any other burning than that of &s;ome odoriferous woods, gums, &amp;c. The &s;epulchres into which the bones and a&s;hes of per&s;ons of rank

are depo&s;ited, are generally very magnificent, and &s;ituated at &s;ome di&s;tance from the towns.</P>
<P>The empire of Japan con&s;i&s;ts chiefly of the three large i&s;lands of Niphon or Hiphon, Ximo, and Xicoco, and the &s;outhern parts of the large continent of Jedzo, on the north &s;ide of the great i&s;land of Niphon.</P>
<P>The i&s;land of Niphon lies about thirty leagues ea&s;t of Korea, extends from 33&deg;. 10&prime;. to 41&deg;. of north latitude, and from 132&frac12;. degrees to 147&frac12;. ea&s;t longitude; its length, from ea&s;t to we&s;t, being &s;ix hundred and &s;ixty miles; its breadth, from north to &s;outh, where broade&s;t, four hundred; but, in other parts, only between an hundred and fifty and two hundred miles; and its circumference fifteen hundred.</P>
<P>The principal cities in the i&s;land are Meaco, Jed|do, O&s;acca, Gurunga, and Saccai.</P>
<P>Meaco, which was formerly con&s;idered as the capital of the whole empire, and is &s;till the re&s;i|dence of the dairos, &s;tands near the middle of the &s;outhern coa&s;t. Three rivers meet in the very cen|tre of the city, where a noble bridge is built over them; and, after a cour&s;e of about twenty or thir|ty miles, falls into the bay of O&s;acca. The dairo's palace is &s;ituated on the north &s;ide of the city. The number of the inhabitants is &s;aid to be near five hundred thou&s;and. Here is a colo&s;&s;us of gilt cop|per, of &s;uch a prodigious &s;ize, that being &s;eated in a chair, eighty feet in breadth, and &s;eventy in height, no le&s;s than fifteen men can &s;tand on its head. Its thumb is fourteen inches in circum|ference, and the re&s;t proportionble; being one of the principal idols of this i&s;land. This city is the grand &s;torehou&s;e of all the manufactures of Ja|pan, of all foreign and home merchandize, and the principal &s;eat of their commerce. Here, as in mo&s;t other trading cities of the Ea&s;t, every trade
<PB N="21" REF="200">
hath its own particular ward or quarter; every one under their proper officers and in&s;pectors.</P>
<P>Jeddo, Jedo, or Yeddo, the other metropolis of Japan, is &s;ituated on the river Tonkag, at the bot|tom of a large bay, but &s;o &s;hallow as to admit of no &s;hips of any burthen coming up to the city. It is, in all other re&s;pects, the mo&s;t con&s;iderable city in Japan; not only for its riches and va&s;t com|merce, but for its largene&s;s and populou&s;ne&s;s, on account of the many princes, lords, and grandees, with their numerous trains and families, attending the court of the cubo, who re&s;ides here, in a palace between eleven and twelve miles in circuit. What a numerous court and retinue the emperors mu&s;t con&s;tantly have in this capital, be&s;ides their guards and officers, which amount to five or &s;ix thou&s;and men, may be gue&s;&s;ed at by the following particulars: 1. That all the princes of the empire, whether tributary or &s;ubject, and all the grandees, nobles, governors, &amp;c. are obliged to attend &s;o many months in the year: 2. That the elde&s;t &s;ons of every king, prince, and grandee, are brought up there, under the emperor's eye, and mu&s;t re&s;ide, until he di&s;mi&s;&s;es, or rai&s;es them to &s;ome po&s;t: 3. That their wives and children are obliged to live there all the year round, to be a kind of ho&s;t|ages; except the emperor gives them leave to go with their hu&s;bands to their own dominions or e&s;tates, during the &s;ix months in which they are not in waiting. The emperor's army, in time of peace, con&s;i&s;ts of about an hundred thou&s;and foot, and twenty thou&s;and hor&s;e, including his garri&s;ons; but, in time of war, every one of the tributary princes is obliged to furni&s;h a certain quota, which increa&s;es the former to near four hundred thou&s;and, and the latter to about forty thou&s;and. Their arms are mu&s;kets, bows and arrows &s;cymitars and dagger. Of the immen&s;e revenue of this empire, &s;ome $li|mate may be made from the pen&s;ions and $Span$
<PB N="22" REF="210">
paid to the governors and other officers, and the em|peror's own particular expences, which are &s;aid alto|gether to amount to twenty-eight millions &s;terling. He is, be&s;ides, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of immen&s;e trea&s;ures in dia|monds, pearls, and other precious jewels: to &s;ay nothing of the va&s;t quantities of gold, &s;ilver, rich furniture, merchandize, and other valuable com|modities, which are &s;tored up in his trea&s;ury and magazines. Jeddo contains an incredible number of &s;tately palaces, temples, mona&s;teries, and other public buildings; but the private are generally low and mean without, though neat and conve|nient within.</P>
<P>The i&s;land of Ximo is computed to be about two hundred and ninety miles in circuit, exclu&s;ive of its creeks and bays. It is divided into nine provinces, the capitals of which are Bungo, Fiungo, Vo&s;uma, Saxuma, Fingo, T&s;i-cungo, Figen, Chicugen, and Buigen.</P>
<P>In this i&s;land al&s;o &s;tands Nanghazak, famed for being the only place in the whole Japane&s;e empire where the Dutch are permitted to come and traf|fic. It &s;tands on the we&s;tern coa&s;t, at the bottom of a deep bay of its name. The haven, which lies north of the town, is long and deep, and &s;eldom without fifty or &s;ixty merchantmen; but the bay is difficult and dangerous, on account of the many &s;hnoals, banks, and rocks in it. The Dutch factory is &s;ituated on a point of rock in a &s;mall i&s;land, or, as Thevenot calls it, a penin&s;ula, named Di&s;nia, or De&s;ima, which is parted from the city only by a river and a wall, being about two miles in compa&s;s. Neither the Dutch merchants and &s;ailors during their &s;tay, which is nine months, nor the people of the factory, during the re&s;t of the year, are allowed to &s;tir out of the i&s;land, or to conver&s;e with any of the natives, but &s;uch as are appointed by the gover|nor, except during the &s;ix weeks of open trade,

when the Japane&s;e come into the i&s;land, and &s;et up their rich booths, furni&s;hed with all manner of mer|chandize. The commodities exported from hence are rice, &s;ilk, cotton, &amp;c. wrought; fine porcelain, and Japan wares; gold and &s;ilver, tho' not in &s;uch large quantities as formerly; copper, wrought and in bars; iron, &s;teel, and other ba&s;e, and &s;ome artificial metals; variety of rich furs, mo&s;tly brought from the Land of Jetzo; tea of all &s;orts, much finer and better cured than that of China; &s;ome &s;orts of which have &s;uch an excellent flavour and ta&s;te, that they &s;ell even above the price of gold, weight for weight: be&s;ides a great variety of medicinal herbs, roots, woods, gums, &amp;c. which, as well as their tea, are &s;old genuine, well dried, and pre|&s;erved, and without the lea&s;t mixture or adultera|tion, &s;uch as are commonly practi&s;ed in China. To the&s;e we may add diamonds, and other precious &s;tones, pearls of exqui&s;ite beauty, coral, amber|gri&s;e, &amp;c. great quantities of fine &s;ea-&s;hells, on which the Japane&s;e u&s;ed to &s;et no price, till the Eu|ropeans taught them to value them by the exce&s;|&s;ive fondne&s;s they &s;hewed for them. In exchange for tho&s;e commodities, the Hollanders bring them gla&s;&s;es of all &s;orts, which are in great reque&s;t in Ja|pan, e&s;pecially looking-gla&s;&s;es; raw and wrought &s;ilks, raw hides, hempen and woollen cloths, quick|&s;ilver, borax, antimony, &s;pices of all kinds, of which they make an immen&s;e gain, not only in Ja|pan, but in all other parts of India, where they &s;ell, perhaps, as great quantities as they import into Europe, and by them purcha&s;e the com|modities of one country, to &s;ell in another. They likewi&s;e import hither &s;on &s;orts of &s;ugar, mu&s;k, camphire, &s;iampan, Brazil and other woods, calem|bac, elephant's teeth, and a great number of &s;mall wares, which come from China, Thibet, Siam, &amp;c. china, jin-&s;eng, and other medicinal roots, from
<PB N="24" REF="230">
Tartary. All the&s;e commodities are exported and imported cu&s;tom free, which is the chief encou|ragement given to the Japan commerce; but with this dreadful clau&s;e, that if any contraband goods are found on board tho&s;e ve&s;&s;els, or the commodi|ties be either adulterated or damaged, or any fraud or cheat be di&s;covered in their invoices, &amp;c. they are &s;ure to be puni&s;hed with the utmo&s;t &s;everity, no nation having &s;uch &s;evere laws again&s;t all &s;uch abu&s;es in trade</P>
<P>Xicoco, the la&s;t con&s;iderable i&s;land, lies between Niphon on the ea&s;t, and Ximo on the we&s;t. It is almo&s;t of a &s;quare figure, divided into four pro|vinces, and its circumference, exclu&s;ive of bays and creeks, is computed at an hundred and ninety miles. The mo&s;t con&s;iderable maritime town in it, if not the metropolis of the whole i&s;land, is called A&s;a.</P>
<P>We &s;hall conclude this account of Japan with ju&s;t mentioning a few other curio&s;ities, be&s;ides tho&s;e we have occa&s;ionally taken notice of already.</P>
<P>Among the animal kind, we may reckon their white a$ts, in &s;hape, bigne&s;s, and other particulars, $$$te our common pi&s;mires. The male ducks are no le&s;s curious for their largene&s;s, the beauty of their &s;hape, and the variety of their colours and feathers. They have nightingales with &s;uch &s;weet pipes and not$s, that the curious will give twenty cobans for one of them, each coban being worth twenty-three and an half Dutch guilders. Of the Ja|pane&s;e in&s;ects, of the flying kind, the male of that called the night fly is greatly admired for its beau|ty. It hath four wings, two of which are tran&s;pa|rent, and cover a pair of others, which are &s;hining and poli&s;hed, and mo&s;t beautifully variegated with blue and golden lines.</P>
<P>Among the vegetable curio&s;ities, the camphire tree is well worth our notice, which is cla&s;&s;ed among
<PB N="25" REF="240">
the laurel kind, and bears a berry of a purple or blacki&s;h colour. In this country the camphire is extracted by a &s;imple decoction of the roots and wood, cut into &s;mall pieces.</P>
<P>They have &s;everal trees here, the wood of which, when &s;awn and poli&s;hed, is &s;o beautifully veined, and variegated with different colours and &s;hades, repre&s;enting land&s;capes, birds, bea&s;ts, &amp;c. that they look as if they had been painted by a &s;kilful hand.</P>
<P>The bridges in this country are built mo&s;tly of cedar, and in general are very &s;trong, wide, and lofty, widening on each &s;ide like two wings, and railed.</P>
<P>The Japane&s;e are fond of large bells, but theirs are &s;uch as have no clear &s;ound, but rather a dull heavy one. They are ca&s;t much after the &s;ame odd manner as tho&s;e of China, and &s;truck with a wood|en clapper or hammer.</P>
<P>The famed catechu, or Japan earth, is com|pounded of &s;ome in&s;pi&s;&s;ated juice, brought hither from other parts by the Dutch and Chine&s;e, and mixed up here with &s;ome quantity of amber, the be&s;t camphire, and &s;ome other ingredients, and made into round little balls, cakes, idols, flowers, &amp;c. and then put into neat boxes, for &s;ale and exporta|tien. To the north of Japan lies what is called the i&s;land of Je&s;&s;o, but very little is known of it; not &s;o much as whether it is an i&s;land, or joined to the continent of A&s;ia.</P>

They were di&s;co|vered by Ferdinand Magellan, a Portugue&s;e gen|tleman, who had &s;erved his native country, both in the wars of Africa and in the Ea&s;t-Indies; parti|cularly under Albuquerque, the famous Portu|gue&s;e general, who reduced Goa and Malacca to the obedience of that crown. Magellan, having had a con&s;iderable &s;hare in tho&s;e actions, and find|ing him&s;elf neglected by the government of Portu|gal, and even denied, as it is &s;aid, the &s;mall advance of a ducat a month in his pay, left the court of Portugal in di&s;gu&s;t, and offered his &s;ervice to Charles V. then emperor of Germany and king of Spain, whom he convinced of the probability of di&s;covering a way to the Spice I&s;lands, in the Ea&s;t-Indies, by the we&s;t; whereupon, the command of five &s;mall &s;hips being given him, he &s;et &s;ail from Seville, on the tenth of Augu&s;t 1519, and &s;tand|ing over to the coa&s;t of South-America, proceed|ed &s;outhward to 52&deg;. where he fortunately hit upon a &s;trait, &s;ince called the Strait of Magellan, which carried him into the Pacific Ocean or South-Sea, and then, &s;teering northward, repa&s;&s;ed the equator; after which, he &s;tretched away to the we&s;t, acro&s;s that va&s;t ocean, till he arrived at Guam, one of the Ladrones, on the &s;ixth of March 1521, and &s;oon after got to the Philippine I&s;lands, which he took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of in the name of the king of Spain, but happened to be killed in a &s;kirmi&s;h he had with the natives of one of them. His peo|ple, however, arrived afterwards at the Moluc|cas, or Clove I&s;lands, where they left a colony, and returned to Spain, by the way of the Cape of Good Hope; being the fir&s;t that ever &s;ailed round the globe. But there was no attempt made by the Spaniards to &s;ubdue or plant the Philippine I&s;lands until the year 1564, in the reign of Philip

There is not a &s;oil in the world that produces greater plenty of all things for life; as appears by the multitude of inhabitants to be found in the woods and mountains, who &s;ub&s;i&s;t almo&s;t entirely by the fruits of the earth, and the ve|ni&s;on they take. Nor can any country appear more beautiful; for there is a perpetual verdure, and buds, blo&s;&s;oms, and fruit, are found upon the trees all the year round, as well on the mountains as in the cultivated gardens. Va&s;t quantities of gold are wa&s;hed down from the hills by the rains, and found mixed with the &s;and of their rivers. There are al&s;o mines of other metals, and excellent load-&s;tones, found here; and &s;uch numbers of wild buffaloes, that a good hunt&s;man on hor&s;eback, armed with a &s;pear, will kill ten or twenty in a day. The Spa|niards take them for their hides, which they &s;ell to the Chine&s;e; and their carca&s;es &s;erve the Moun|taineers for food. Their woods al&s;o abound with deer, wild hogs, and goats.

have multiplied con&s;iderably; but the &s;heep that were brought over came to nothing. The trees produce a great variety of gums; one kind, which is the commone&s;t, by the Spaniards called brea, is u&s;ed in&s;tead of pitch; of the others, &s;ome are medicinal, others odoriferous.</P>
<P>In tho&s;e i&s;lands are monkies and baboons of a mon&s;trous bigne&s;s, that will defend them&s;elves if attacked by men. When they can find no fruit in the mountains, they go down to the &s;ea to catch crabs and oy&s;ters; and that the oy&s;ters may not clo&s;e and catch their paws, they fir&s;t put in a &s;tone to prevent their &s;hutting clo&s;e: they take crabs by putting their tail in the holes where they lie, and when the crab lays hold of it, they draw him out. There are al&s;o great numbers of civet-cats in &s;ome of the i&s;lands. The bird called tavan, is a black &s;ea-fowl, &s;omething le&s;s than a hen, and has a long neck; it lays its eggs in the &s;and by the &s;ea-&s;ide, forty or fifty in a trench, and then covers them, and they are hatched by the heat of the &s;un. They have likewi&s;e the bird &s;aligan, which builds her ne&s;t on the &s;ides of rocks, as the &s;wallows do a|gain&s;t a wall; and the&s;e are the delicious birds ne&s;ts &s;o much e&s;teemed, being a kind of jelly that di&s;&s;olves in warm water.</P>
<P>The Spaniards have introduced &s;everal of the American fruits, which thrive here as well as in America; the cocoa or chocolate nut particularly, which increa&s;es &s;o that they have no occa&s;ion now to import it from Mexico. Here is al&s;o the tree amet, from which the natives draw water; and there is likewi&s;e a kind of cane, by the Spaniards called vaxuco, which, if cut, yields fair water enough for a draught, of which there are plenty in the mountains, where water is mo&s;t wanted.</P>
<P>The&s;e i&s;lands being hot and moi&s;t, produce a|bundance of venomous creatures, as the &s;oil does
<PB N="29" REF="280">
poi&s;onous herbs and flowers, which do not kill tho&s;e who touch or ta&s;te them, but &s;o infect the air, that many people die in the time of their blo&s;&s;om|ing.</P>
<P>The orange, lemon, and &s;everal other trees, bear twice a year. If they plant a &s;prig, within a year it becomes a tree, and bears fruit; and therefore, without any hyperbole, &s;ays our author, I may affirm, that I never &s;aw &s;uch a luxuriant verdant &s;oil, nor woods full of &s;uch old, large, and lofty trees, nor trees that yield more &s;u&s;tenance to man, in any part of the world. However the&s;e i&s;lands, be&s;ides the inconveniences mentioned above, are al&s;o &s;ubject to earthquakes, which are &s;ome|times very fatal.</P>
<P>The whole number of them is &s;aid to be eleven hundred; but the principal, and that on which the re&s;t depends, is Lucon, Luzon, or Luconia. The Spaniards call it Manilla, or, as it is generally written, Manila, from its capital. It had the name of Luzon from a cu&s;tom that prevailed among the natives of beating or brui&s;ing their rice in wooden mortars, before they either boiled or baked it; luzon, in their language, &s;ignifying a mortar.</P>
<P>As to the &s;ituation, it is remarkably happy, lying between the ea&s;tern and we&s;tern continents, and having China on the north, at the di&s;tance of about &s;ixty leagues; the i&s;lands of Japan on the north-ea&s;t, at the di&s;tance of about two hundred and fifty leagues from the neare&s;t of them; the ocean on the ea&s;t; the other i&s;lands on the &s;outh; and on the we&s;t Malacca, Patana, Siam, Cambodia, Cochin-china, and other provinces of India, the neare&s;t at the di&s;tance of three hundred leagues.</P>
<P>The middle of this i&s;land is in the latitude 15&deg;. north; the ea&s;t point in 13&deg;. 30&prime;. and the mo&s;t
<PB N="30" REF="290">
northern point in 19&deg;. The &s;hape of it is &s;aid to re&s;emble that of an arm bent; the whole length being about one hundred and &s;ixty Spani&s;h leagues, the greate&s;t breadth between thirty and forty, and the circumference about three hundred and fifty. As to the longitude the charts differ, &s;ome making the middle of the i&s;land to lie 113&deg;. ea&s;t from Lon|don, and others in 160.</P>
<P>As to the climate it is hot and moi&s;t. One thing is held very extraordinary, that in &s;tormy weather there is much lightning and rain, and that thun|der is &s;eldom heard till this is over. During the months of June, July, Augu&s;t, and part of Sep|tember, the we&s;t and &s;outh winds blow, which they call vendavales, bringing &s;uch rains and &s;torms, that the fields are all overflowed, and they are forced to have little boats to go from one place to another. From October till the middle of De|cember, the north wind prevails; and from that time till May, the ea&s;t and &s;outh-ea&s;t, which winds are there called breezes. Thus there are two &s;ea&s;ons in tho&s;e &s;eas, by the Portugue&s;e called monzoens; whence our word mon&s;oons, that is, the breezes half the year, with a &s;erene dry air; and the ven|davales the other half, wet and &s;tormy. It is fur|ther to be ob&s;erved, that in this climate, no ver|min breed upon Europeans, tho' they wear dirty &s;hirts, whereas it is otherwi&s;e with the Indians. The days here being always of an equal length, and the weather never cold, neither their cloaths, nor the hour of dining, &s;upping, doing bu&s;ine&s;s, &s;tudying or praying, are ever changed; nor is cloth worn, but only again&s;t the rain.</P>
<P>The air here being, as has been ob&s;erved, very hot and moi&s;t, is not whole&s;ome; but is wor&s;e for young men, that come from Europe, than for the old. As for the natives, without u&s;ing many precautions,
<PB N="31" REF="300">
they live very commonly to four&s;core or an hun|dred.</P>
<P>The &s;oil is &s;o rich, that rice grows even on the tops of the mountains, without being watered; and this makes it &s;o plentiful, that the Indians va|lue gold &s;o little as not to pick it up, tho' it lies almo&s;t every where under their feet.</P>
<P>Among the di&s;advantages of the i&s;land, be&s;ides frequent and terrible earthquakes, here are &s;everal burning mountains. The face of the i&s;land, how|ever, is far from being disfigured by them, or by the con&s;equences of their explo&s;ions.</P>
<P>The mountainers called Tingiani, have no par|ticular place of abode, but always live under the &s;helter of trees, which &s;erve them in&s;tead of hou&s;es, and furni&s;h them with food; and when the fruit is eaten up, they remove where there is a fre&s;h &s;ort.</P>
<P>Here are forty different &s;orts of palm-trees, the mo&s;t excellent cocoas, wild cinnamon, wild nut|megs, and &s;ome &s;ay wild cloves al&s;o; ebony, &s;an|dal wood, and the be&s;t ca&s;&s;ia, and in &s;uch plenty, that they feed their hogs with its fruit; all kinds of cattle, civet-cats, be&s;ides prodigious quantities of gold, amber, and ambergri&s;e.</P>
<P>There are &s;everal &s;orts of people in this i&s;land, be&s;ides the Spaniards, as the Tagalians, or Taga|leze, the Pintadoes, or painted negroes, the Ilayas, or Tinglianos, and the Negrellos. The Taga|lians, who are thought to be Malayans by de&s;cent, are a mode&s;t, tractable, and well-di&s;po&s;ed people. The Pintadoes, or painted negroes, are tall, &s;trait, &s;trong, active, and of an excellent di&s;po&s;ition. The Tinghianos, whom &s;ome &s;uppo&s;e to be de&s;cended from the Japane&s;e, are very brave, and yet very courteous and humane. They live entirely on the gifts of nature; and never &s;leep under any other &s;hade than that of the trees or a cave. The Ne|grillos,
<PB N="32" REF="310">
who are held to be the Aborigines of the i&s;land, and are barbarous and brutal to the la&s;t degree. When they kill a Spaniard, they make a cup of his &s;kull and drink out of it.</P>
<P>Luconia is divided into &s;everal provinces, con|taining divers towns, the chief of which are Ma|nila, Caceres, New-Segovia, Bondo, Pa&s;&s;acao, Iba|lon, Bulaw, Ser&s;ocon, or Bagatao, Lampon, Fer|nandina, Bolinao, Playahonda, Cavite, Mindora, Caleleya and Balayan.</P>
<P>Manila, the capital, on the &s;outh ea&s;t &s;ide of the i&s;land, where a large river falls into the &s;ea, and forms a noble bay, thirty leagues in compa&s;s, to which the Spaniards have given the name of Ba|hia, becau&s;e the river runs out of the great lake Bahi, which lies at the di&s;tance of &s;ix leagues be|hind it. In compa&s;s it is two miles, in length one third of a mile; the &s;hape irregular, being narrow at both ends, and wide in the middle. On the &s;outh it is wa&s;hed by the &s;ea, and on the north and ea&s;t by the river; being al&s;o &s;trongly fortified with walls, ba&s;tions, forts, and batteries.</P>
<P>Manila contains about three thou&s;and &s;ouls, who are a very motley race, di&s;tingui&s;hed by &s;everal &s;trange names, and produced by the conjunction of Spaniards, Chine&s;e, Malabars, Blacks, and others inhabiting the city and i&s;lands depending on it. Without the walls are large &s;uburbs, particularly that inhabited by the Chine&s;e merchants, called Sangleys. In proportion to the &s;ize of the place, the number of churches and religious hou&s;es is very great. Only &s;mall ve&s;&s;els can come up to Manila; but three leagues &s;outh of it is the town and port of Cavite, defended by the ca&s;tle of St. Philip, by much the be&s;t fortre&s;s in the i&s;land, and capable of receiving the large&s;t &s;hips. Here &s;tands the ar&s;enal where the galloons are built, for which there are from three to &s;ix or eight hundred
<PB N="33" REF="320">
con&s;tantly employed, who are relieved every month, and while upon duty, are maintained at the king's expence. By an earthquake which happened here in 1645, a third part of the city of Manila was de&s;troyed, and no le&s;s than three thou&s;and people peri&s;hed in the ruins.</P>
<P>In the late war, Spain having entered into en|gagements with France, in con&s;equence of the family-compact of the hou&s;e of Bourbon, it was found expedient in England to declare war al&s;o again&s;t Spain. Whereupon a force was &s;ent out from our Ea&s;t-India &s;ettlements, particularly Ma|dra&s;s, for the conque&s;t of the Phillippine I&s;lands, under general Draper, and admiral Corni&s;h, who after a &s;iege of twelve days, took Manila, on the 6th of October 1762, by &s;torm; but, to &s;ave &s;o fine a city from de&s;truction, agreed to accept a ran&s;om, amounting to a million &s;terling, a part of which, it is &s;aid, is &s;till unpaid. The Spani&s;h viceroy re|&s;ides in this city, and lives in the &s;tate of a &s;o|vereign prince. The government is &s;aid to be one of the be&s;t in the gift of the king of Spain. When the city was taken, as above, the archbi&s;hop, who is a kind of pope in this part of the world, was al&s;o viceroy. Five large &s;hips, loaded with the riches of the Ea&s;t, as diamonds from Golconda, cinnamon from Ceylon, pepper from Sumatra and Java, cloves and nutmegs from the Moluccas and Banda I&s;lands, camphire from Borneo, benjamin and ivory from Cambodia, &s;ilks, tea, and china ware from China, &amp;c. &s;ail yearly from hence to Acapulco in Mexico, and return freighted with &s;ilver, making four hundred per cent profit.</P>
<P>The city of Manila is governed by two alcaides; the re&s;t of the cities and great towns have each an alcaide; and in every village there is a corrigidore. Appeals from their &s;entences are made to the royal court at Manila, in which there are four judges,
<PB N="34" REF="330">
and a fi&s;cal, or attorney-general; each of the&s;e judges has a &s;alary of three thou&s;and three hun|dred pieces of eight per annum. The viceroy is pre&s;ident, and, in that quality, has an income of four thou&s;and pieces of eight, but he has no vote; yet if the judges are equally divided, the pre&s;ident names a doctor of the civil law, who, in virtue of his appointment, has a deci&s;ive voice. The at|torney-general, in right of his office, is protector of the Chine&s;e, in con&s;ideration of which he receives &s;ix hundred pieces of eight every year. As for the Indians that are in &s;ubjection, they pay tribute in the following proportions: young men from eigh|teen, and from thence, if they continue &s;ingle, to the age of &s;ixty, pay five rials of plate by way of capitation; as &s;ingle women likewi&s;e do from twen|ty-four to fifty; married men pay ten rials. It is computed that there are within the compa&s;s of this government two hundred and fifty thou&s;and Indians, &s;ubject to his catholic maje&s;ty, of whom two-fifths hold immediately from the king, and the re&s;t from lords or proprietors, who pay two rials for every one for the maintenance of the forces, and the like &s;um for the pari&s;h prie&s;t. The royal revenue is computed at about half a million of pieces of eight, exclu&s;ive of ca&s;ualties. In regard to the military e&s;tabli&s;hment, the garri&s;on of Ma|nila con&s;i&s;ts of about eight hundred or a thou&s;and men, and there are about three thou&s;and more in the Philippines. The viceroy is by his office cap|tain general, with a &s;alary of about four thou&s;and pieces of eight.</P>
<P>Mindanao is the large&s;t of the&s;e i&s;lands next to Luconia, being near two hundred miles long, and one hundred and fifty broad; but it is not &s;ubject to Spain. The inhabitants are of different &s;orts; tho&s;e of the in-land country are &s;uppo&s;ed to be the antient Pagan inhabitants, whom the Mo|hammedans,
<PB N="35" REF="340">
that po&s;&s;e&s;s the coa&s;ts, have driven up into the mountains.</P>
<P>The air of Mindanao is not exce&s;&s;ive hot, it is &s;aid, tho' it lies within &s;ix degrees of the equator, being refre&s;hed by the &s;ea-breeze on every &s;ide in the day-time. The inhabitants generally go al|mo&s;t naked.</P>
<P>The middle of the country is woody and moun|tainous; but between the hills are rich vallies, and near the &s;ea-coa&s;t it is generally a plain country, producing rice, and &s;uch fruits as u&s;ually grow between the tropicks. They have al&s;o the libby and &s;ago-tree, of the pith whereof they make bread, and a great deal is exported even to Europe, being fir&s;t dried and grained like &s;eed. The plan|tain fruit is very good and plentiful here, which is their principal food, and of this al&s;o they make their drink. Tobacco grows more plentifully in this i&s;land than in any other part of India, and abundance of gold du&s;t is found in the &s;ands of the rivulets. The i&s;land yields al&s;o a great deal of bees-wax, and as &s;ome &s;ay, both the clove and nutmeg-tree.</P>
<P>The midland countries, as well as the coa&s;ts, are divided among&s;t a great many petty princes. The &s;ultan of Mindanao, who is a Mohammedan, is the mo&s;t powerful among&s;t them: he re&s;ides at the city of Mindanao, which &s;tands on the &s;outh &s;ide of the i&s;land, on a &s;mall river, two miles from the &s;ea. The hou&s;es here, like tho&s;e of Siam, are built on pillars fourteen or fifteen feet high, to &s;ecure them again&s;t the flood, which covers the flat countries five or &s;ix months of the year. He is ab&s;olute in his dominions, and has &s;ome &s;hips of war, as well as land forces.</P>

<HEAD>The MOLUCCAS, or CLOVE ISLANDS.</HEAD>
<P>The Moluccas, or Spice I&s;lands, were not di&s;|covered by the Spaniards 'till the year 1511, and then as it were by chance; for Francis Serrano, Diego d'Abreu, and Ferdinand Magellan, who had been &s;ent to make di&s;coveries, having been &s;e|parated by a &s;torm, the fir&s;t penetrated as far as Ternate, and the two latter di&s;covered the i&s;land of Amboyna, and afterwards that of Banda.</P>
<P>The&s;e valuable i&s;lands con&s;i&s;t, &s;trictly &s;peaking, of no more than five, viz. Bachiam, Machiam, Motyr, Ternate, and Tydor, from whence it is &s;aid they received their name, in the original language of the inhabitants. They are not out of &s;ight of each other, and lie all within the compa&s;s of twen|ty-five leagues to the &s;outh of the Philippines, in 125&deg;. of ea&s;t longitude, and between 1&deg;. &s;outh, and 2&deg;. north latitude.</P>
<P>They produce neither corn nor rice; but the natives make their bread of &s;agoe. Be&s;ides the tropical fruits, they once produced great quanti|ties of cloves, mace, and nutmegs; but the Dutch, who are now ma&s;ters of them, &s;end people every year to root up all the plants of that kind, le&s;t other nations &s;hould po&s;&s;e&s;s them, and have tran&s;|planted the cloves to Amboyna, which, as well as Ceram, and &s;everal others, lying to the &s;outh of tho&s;e abovementioned, are reckoned among the Moluccas, taken in a large &s;en&s;e.</P>
<P>The five i&s;les, properly called the Moluccas, are under the dominion of three kings, &s;ubordinate to the Dutch. Their coa&s;ts are rendered very dan|gerous by &s;ands and &s;helves. They were former|ly &s;ubject to the Chine&s;e; fell next under the Ja|vane&s;e; were in proce&s;s of time &s;ubdued by the Malayans; and the Mohammedans had begun to
<PB N="37" REF="360">
&s;ettle in them, and convert the inhabitants to their religion, but a very little while before they were di&s;covered by the Portugue&s;e.</P>
<P>Ternate, the large&s;t, is not quite thirty miles in compa&s;s; the land high, and yielding good water, but little provi&s;ion, and few cattle, except goats. The i&s;land formerly abounded in cloves. Here are extraordinary fine parrots, exceeding in beauty tho&s;e of the We&s;t Indies, and many birds of Para|di&s;e. They have al&s;o almonds, and coar&s;e tobacco. The king, who re&s;ides in this i&s;land, was formerly &s;overeign over twenty-two others that lie in the great Archipelago, between Mindanao on the north; tho&s;e of Bima and Corea on the &s;outh; and the terra firma of Papaos, or New Guinea, on the ea&s;t; and had his tribute in gold, amber, and birds of Paradi&s;e.</P>
<P>Of the Moluccas, taken in a large &s;en&s;e, Am|boyna is the mo&s;t con&s;iderable, being one of the bigge&s;t of them, and the &s;eat of the &s;econd Dutch government, next to that of Batavia. Formerly it was the &s;eat of the governor-general; which, after the building of Batavia was transferred thither, on account of the advantageous &s;ituation of that city in the mid&s;t of all the company's &s;ettlements. It is &s;ituated in the Archipelago of St. Lazarus, be|tween the third and fourth degree of &s;outh latitude, 145&deg;. of longitude from the Canary I&s;lands, and a hundred and twenty leagues to the ea&s;tward of Batavia. The fort here was taken from the Por|tugu&s;e by the Dutch in 1605; but they did not make them&s;elves entirely ma&s;ters of Amboyna, and the adjacent countries, till the year 1627, when they had got rid of the Engli&s;h al&s;o. This con|que&s;t put the clove trade wholly into their hands: whence the Moluccas are &s;tiled the gold mine of the company; and &s;o they have proved, if we con&s;ider the profit they draw from them, and how
<PB N="38" REF="370">
little fear there is of their being ever exhau&s;ted. To convince the reader of this, we need only ob&s;erve, that a pound weight of nutmegs, or of cloves, co&s;ts the company not much above a half-penny, and every body knows at what rate they are &s;old in Europe.</P>
<P>This i&s;land of Amboyna is in the centre of this rich commerce; and to keep it more effectually in their hands, the company takes care to have all the clove trees in the adjacent i&s;lands grubbed up and de&s;troyed; and &s;ometimes when the harve&s;t is very large in Amboyna, part of the produce there is burnt likewi&s;e.</P>
<P>Amboyna is about &s;eventy miles in circumfer|ence, divided into two parts, viz. a greater and le&s;&s;er penin&s;ula. The former called Hiton, is twelve leagues in length, and two and a half broad. In this the Dutch have no le&s;s than five forts, or rather &s;trong redoubts, mounted with cannon; the other is called Leytimor, five leagues in length, and one and a half broad, which is the &s;outhern part of the i&s;land; on this &s;tands the fort of Victoria, which is the re&s;idence of the governor, and his coun|cil, compo&s;ed of fifteen gentlemen or merchants. The fortre&s;s is a &s;quare, the ramparts mounted with &s;ixty pieces of bra&s;s cannon, and the garri&s;on u&s;u|ally compo&s;ed of &s;ix hundred men. The inhabi|tants of Amboyna are computed at &s;eventy or eighty thou&s;and, of which but a &s;mall number are Dutch, and this obliges them to be continually up|on their guard, and to keep a competent number of troops in each of their forts, particularly in that of Middleburgh, which &s;tands upon the i&s;thmus that connects the&s;e penin&s;ulas. There are al&s;o redoubts and garri&s;ons in all the i&s;lands of this government.</P>
<P>The time of cutting the cloves, or the clove har|ve&s;t, is between the middle of October and the
<PB N="39" REF="380">
middle of December, &s;ometimes &s;ooner, &s;ometimes later, according as the fruit comes to its maturity. Some years the produce is four, five, or &s;ix times as much as in others; but, taking it at a medium for &s;even years, it may be well fixed at a mil|lion of pounds; and it is computed that, one with another, this is four pounds from every bearing tree. A few days after the fruit is gathered, they collect the cloves together, and dry them before the fire on hurdles, by which means they lo&s;e the beautiful red colour they derived from nature, and change into a deep purple, or rather black, which is per|haps occa&s;ioned by their being &s;prinkled with wa|ter. It is pretended, that this &s;prinkling is nece&s;|&s;ary to hinder the worm from getting into the fruit; but perhaps a better rea&s;on may be a&s;&s;igned for it, which is adding weight to the cloves. The wild clove is larger, and more &s;pungy; the culti|vated clove le&s;s hard, and much more aromatic in &s;mell and ta&s;te. There are ten i&s;lands depend|ent on Amboyna, viz. Ceram, which is the large&s;t in the whole government; indeed larger than all the re&s;t, taking Amboyna into the number; Ceram-Lavat, Bouro, Amblau, Manipa, Kelang, Bonoa, Oxna, Honimoa, and Nou&s;&s;a-Laout. It is only in Amboyna, and the three la&s;t, that cloves are now cultivated; whereas they formerly grew in all the i&s;lands, more e&s;pecially in Ceram. The&s;e are the i&s;lands, the circuit of which the governor of Amboyna makes once in three years, in order to &s;ee that the company's injunctions are complied with, and that no cloves are &s;uffered to grow.</P>
<P>It is &s;aid that the Dutch now plant coffee in Am|boyna, and that it turns to great account. We are told al&s;o, that not very long ago, namely un|der the government of Mr. Bernard, not only con|&s;iderable quantities of gold du&s;t were found in the mountains wa&s;hed down by the torrents, but even
<PB N="40" REF="390">
a gold mine; but whether it is now wrought, or in what condition it is, we cannot pretend to &s;ay. A kind of red wood, exceeding firm and durable, and naturally embelli&s;hed in its grain with abun|dance of beautiful figures, is al&s;o mentioned among the productions of this valuable i&s;land.</P>
<P>The Engli&s;h and Dutch had here once their re|&s;pective factories and &s;ettlements, and had by treaty agreed to divide the traffic to the &s;pice i&s;lands be|tween them; but the Dutch, under pretence of a plot the Engli&s;h were engaged in again&s;t the&s;e high and mighty u&s;urpers, fell upon the Engli&s;h factors and merchants, tortured them by all the cruel methods they could invent, in order to make them confe&s;s a plot, and then put them to death. They &s;eized upon the Engli&s;h &s;hipping, expelled them from their &s;ettlements in the Banda or Nutmeg i&s;lands, which had put them&s;elves under the pro|tection of the king of Great-Britain, and acknow|ledged them&s;elves his &s;ubjects, and proceeded to ma&s;&s;acre and extirpate the natives. This happened in a time of full peace, in the year 1622, ju&s;t after a treaty was concluded between the two nations for confirming their re&s;pective rights and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions in the Ea&s;t Indies; and they have continued in po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of them ever &s;ince.</P>

they are of infinite con&s;equence to the Dutch, on account of the important commerce in nutmegs, which are covered by the mace; and which grow in &s;uch prodigious quantities as to enable the Dutch to &s;upply all the markets of Europe. The nutmeg, when ripe, is pretty near the &s;ize of a walnut, and is covered with two &s;kins or &s;hells. The fir&s;t is very tough, and of the thickne&s;s of a man's finger, which falls off of it&s;elf, as the fruit ripens: when it is candied, it has a very fine ta&s;te. The &s;econd is of a red colour, and has a very odoriferous &s;mell: on the opening of this the fruit appears, with a little flower at the top, which is very beautiful, and in its form re&s;embles the lilly of the valley. They gather the nuts, and dry them: but, in the fir&s;t place, they are thrown into quick lime; for otherwi&s;e worms would breed, and de&s;troy them. Here are al&s;o mo&s;t of the tropical fruits, but &s;carce any corn or cattle.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the i&s;lands mentioned above, there are &s;everal others in the neighbourhood, in which nut|megs would grow, if the company did not take care to have them de&s;troyed every year; which, at fir&s;t &s;ight, may &s;eem extraordinary, &s;ince one would imagine, that their being thoroughly rooted out once would prevent their growing again But this difficulty is ea&s;ily &s;olved, when it is known, that there are in the i&s;lands of Banda, and at Amboyna, &s;everal &s;orts of birds; but more e&s;pecially a kind of turtle-doves or pigeons, that, by &s;wallowing cloves and nutmegs, and voiding them again, pro|pagate wild trees over all the&s;e i&s;lands, which the company obliges the inhabitants to pull up and de|&s;troy; and the birds al&s;o have no quarter given them in the plantations. The great nutmeg har|ve&s;t is in the months of June and Augu&s;t, and in the month of November there is a kind of latter harve&s;t, or gleaning, con&s;i&s;ting only of &s;uch fruits as were left to ripen; but in the month of April
<PB N="42" REF="410">
they vi&s;it the trees again, and though the nutmegs gathered at this time are very few, yet they are by far the fine&s;t. One year with another, it is com|puted, that in the three i&s;lands in which the Dutch allow them to grow, eight hundred thou&s;and pounds weight of nutmegs are produced; and, if the common opinion be right, about a fourth part of the &s;ame quantity of mace. Between two and three thou&s;and &s;laves are employed in attending the trees, and curing the fruit. There is a wild nut|meg, as well as wild cinnamon, and wild cloves; but of very little value, and ea&s;ily di&s;tingui&s;hed from the genuine &s;pice.</P>

<HEAD>The I&s;land of CELEBES.</HEAD>
<P>The i&s;land of Celebes, or Maca&s;&s;ar, is &s;ituate un|der the equator, between the i&s;land of Borneo and the Spice I&s;lands, at the di&s;tance of an hundred and &s;ixty leagues from Batavia. Its form is in a manner circular, and its diameter about an hundred and thir|ty leagues. It is called, and with great rea&s;on, the Key of the Spice i&s;lands. The form of the go|vernment here is pretty much the &s;ame as in the other i&s;lands. Since the Dutch drove out the Portugue&s;e, they have taken care to fortify them|&s;elves effectually on the &s;ea-coa&s;t, and have al|ways a very numerous garri&s;on at Maca&s;&s;ar, where the governor re&s;ides; which is &s;o much the more nece&s;&s;ary becau&s;e this i&s;land is very populous, and the people much &s;uperior to the inhabitants of the other i&s;lands. Their complexions are of a light olive, and their features regular and agreeable. They are, generally &s;peaking, a middle-&s;ized peo|ple, active, brave, ingenious, courteous, and well di&s;po&s;ed towards &s;trangers: if well u&s;ed, there are
<PB N="43" REF="420">
no people more faithful, or more obedient; but, if ill treated, they are very revengeful, and very &s;eldom di&s;cover their re&s;entment but by its effects. It is from this i&s;land that the Dutch company draw their be&s;t &s;oldiers, who u&s;e little poi&s;oned arrows, which they blow through a trunk.</P>
<P>This i&s;land is very fruitful, e&s;pecially in rice, cotton, and opium; but it produces no &s;pice, ex|cept pepper; and no place is furni&s;hed with a greater variety of poi&s;ons. The natives, it is &s;aid, &s;tudy which will have the mo&s;t &s;peedy operation. Their darts, when dipped in poi&s;on, give in&s;tant death: if a limb be cut off immediately after the wound is received, it will not &s;ave the patient.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the Dutch and natives, here are many Chine&s;e, who &s;ail from hence, in their own ve&s;&s;els, into all the ports of the company's dominions, de|riving immen&s;e wealth from their exten&s;ive com|merce, which they manage with a dexterity pecu|liar to them&s;elves. The inland country is under the dominion of three different monarchs, who, happily for the company, are con&s;tantly at variance one with the other; and, if it were not for this, they might at any time drive the Dutch out of the i&s;land. The port of Jampoden, in this i&s;land, is &s;aid to be the be&s;t and mo&s;t capacious in all that part of the world. About the year 1720, a gold mine was di&s;covered in this i&s;land; but whether it is worked, and with what &s;ucce&s;s, we are not able to &s;ay.</P>

<P>Borneo is &s;ituated under the equator, and is the large&s;t i&s;land in the world; being eight hundred miles long, and &s;even hundred broad. It has the Philippines on the north, Maca&s;&s;ar on the ea&s;t, Ja|va on the &s;outh, and Sumatra on the we&s;t. The flat country, near the coa&s;t, is overflowed mo&s;t part of the year, which makes the air very unhealthful; and they build their towns upon floats in the mid|dle of their rivers. Be&s;ides rice, cotton, canes, pep|per, camphire, and the tropical fruits, gold is found here, and diamonds of a large &s;ize, and ex|cellent water. The la&s;t are found in their rivers, wa&s;hed down, probably, by the torrents that pour from their lofty mountains.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t remarkable animal the i&s;land pro|duces is the ouran outang, a monkey as big as a man, which &s;ome of our captains have attempted to bring over; but, being bred in &s;o hot a climate, he dies as &s;oon as he comes into cool weather.</P>
<P>The coa&s;t of this i&s;land is governed by Moham|medan princes, the chief of which are tho&s;e of Banjar, Ma&s;&s;een, and Caytongee, who re&s;ide at ci|ties of that name, on the &s;outh-ea&s;t part of the i&s;land; but the original inhabitants &s;till remain in the mountains, and are &s;tiled Beajus, which, in the Malayan tongue, &s;ignifies a wild man.

It is about two hundred and fifty leagues in length, &s;ix|ty in breadth, and five hundred in circumference, very rich and fertile; yielding not only &s;ulphur, rice, ginger, pepper, camphire, ca&s;&s;ia, &s;andal, and other woods and drugs, but al&s;o fine tin, iron, copper, &s;ilver, gold, and diamonds. It is &s;o rich in gold, that it is &s;uppo&s;ed to be the Ophir and Gold|en Cher&s;one&s;e of the antients; but what the Eu|ropeans trade with them for chiefly is their pepper. The camphire of Sumatra is looked upon as the ve|ry fine&s;t in the Indies, and, as the ingenious and accurate Mr. Lockyer a&s;&s;ures us from his own knowledge, is worth half a crown an ounce upon the &s;pot. It bears a great price in China, where they make u&s;e of it as a kind of leaven, mixing it with their own, which is a coar&s;er kind, to which they think it gives odour and &s;pirit.</P>
<P>Both the Engli&s;h and Dutch have &s;everal colo|nies and &s;ettlements here. The chief of the Briti&s;h &s;ettlements are tho&s;e of Bencoolen and Fort M&aacute;rl|brough, on the we&s;t coa&s;t, from whence the Ea&s;t-India company import more pepper than from any country in India.

Authors vary as to its dimen&s;ions, but the mo&s;t moderate allow it nine hundred miles in circuit. The country is mountainous and woody in the middle; but a flat coa&s;t, full of bogs and mar&s;hes, render the air un|healthful. It produces pepper, indigo, &s;ugar, to|bacco, rice, coffee, cocoa-nuts, plaintains, carda|moms, and other tropical fruits. Gold al&s;o, but in no great quantities, hath been found in it. It is di|ver&s;ified by many mountains, woods, and rivers; in all which nature has very bountifully be&s;towed her trea&s;ures. The mountains are many of them &s;o high as to be &s;een at the di&s;tance of three or four leagues. That which is called the Blue Mountain is by far the highe&s;t of them all, and &s;een the far|the&s;t off at &s;ea. They have frequent and very ter|rible earthquakes in this i&s;land, which &s;hake the city of Batavia, and places adjacent, to &s;uch a degree, that the fall of the hou&s;es is expected every moment. The waters in the road are exce&s;&s;ively agitated, in&s;o|much that their motion re&s;embles that of a boiling pot; and in &s;ome places the earth opens, which af|fords a &s;trange and terrible &s;pectacle. The inhabi|tants are of opinion, that the&s;e earthquakes proceed from the mountain Parang, which is full of &s;ulphur, &s;altpetre, and bitumen. The fruits and plants of this i&s;land are all in their &s;everal kinds excellent, and almo&s;t out of number. There are abundance of fore&s;ts &s;cattered over it, in which are all kinds of wild bea&s;ts, &s;uch as buffaloes, tygers, rhinocero&s;es, and wild hor&s;es, with an infinite variety of &s;erpents, &s;ome of them of an enormous &s;ize. Crocodiles

are prodigiou&s;ly large in Java, and are found chief|ly about the mouths of rivers; for, being amphi|bious animals, they delight mo&s;tly in mar&s;hes and &s;avannahs. This creature, like the tortoi&s;e, lays its eggs in the hot &s;ands, without taking any further care of them; and the &s;un hatches them at the pro|per &s;ea&s;on, when they run in&s;tantly into the water. There is, in &s;hort, no kind of animal wanting here: fowls they have of all &s;orts, and exqui&s;itely good, e&s;pecially peacocks, partridges, phea&s;ants, wood|pigeons; and, for curio&s;ity, they have the Indian bat, which differs little in form from ours; but its wings, when extended, mea&s;ure a full yard, and the body of it is of the &s;ize of a rat. They have fi&s;h in great plenty, and very good; &s;o that for the va|lue of three-pence there may be enough bought to dine &s;ix or &s;even men. They have likewi&s;e a multitude of tortoi&s;es, the fle&s;h of which is very little inferior to veal; and there are many who think it better.</P>
<P>It is &s;aid, that there are in the i&s;land upwards of forty great towns, which, from the number of their inhabitants, would, in any other part of the world, merit the title of cities; and more than four thou&s;and five hundred villages, be&s;ides ham|lets, and &s;traggling hou&s;es, lying very near each other, upon the &s;ea-coa&s;t, and in the neighbour|hood of great towns: &s;o that, upon a fair and mo|derate computation, there are within the bounds of the whole i&s;land, taking in per&s;ons of both &s;exes, and of all ranks and ages, more than thirty mil|lions of &s;ouls; &s;o that it is thrice as populous as France, which, tho' twice as big, is not computed to have more than twenty millions of inhabitants.</P>

<P>The city of Batavia is the capital not only of this i&s;land, but of all the Dutch dominions in In|dia. It is an exceeding fine city, &s;ituated in the latitude of 6&deg;. &s;outh, at the mouth of the river Ju|catra, and in the bo&s;om of a large commodious bay, which may be con&s;idered not only as one of the &s;afe&s;t harbours in India, but in the world. The city is &s;urrounded by a rampart, twenty-one feet thick, covered on the out&s;ide with &s;tone, and forti|fied with twenty-two ba&s;tions. This rampart is environed by a ditch forty-five yards over, and full of water, e&s;pecially when the tides are high, in the &s;pring. The avenues to the town are defended by &s;everal forts, each of which is well furni&s;hed with excellent bra&s;s cannon: no per&s;on is &s;uffered to go beyond the&s;e forts without a pa&s;&s;port. The river Jucatra pa&s;&s;es through the mid&s;t of the town, and forms fifteen canals of running water, all faced with free-&s;tone, and adorned with trees that are ever green: over the&s;e canals are fifty-&s;ix bridges, be&s;ides tho&s;e which lie without the town. The &s;treets are all perfectly &s;trait, and each, gene|rally &s;peaking, thirty feet broad. The hou&s;es are built of &s;tone, after the manner of tho&s;e in Hol|land. The city is about a league and a half in
<PB N="49" REF="480">
circumference, and has five gates; but there are ten times the number of hou&s;es without that there are within it. There is a very fine town-hou&s;e, four calvini&s;t churches, be&s;ides other places of wor&s;hip for all &s;orts of religions, a &s;pin-huys or hou&s;e of correction, an orphan-hou&s;e, a magazine of &s;ea &s;tores, &s;everal for &s;pices, with wharfs and cord|manufactures, and many other public buildings. The garri&s;on con&s;i&s;ts commonly of between two and three thou&s;and men. Be&s;ides the forts men|tioned above, there is the citadel of Batavia, a very fine regular fortification, &s;ituated at the mouth of the river, and flanked with four ba&s;tions; two of which command the &s;ea, and the other two the town. It is in this citadel that the governor-gene|ral of the Indies has his palace; over-again&s;t which is that of the director-general, who is the next per|&s;on to the governor. The coun&s;ellors, and other principal officers of the company, have al&s;o their apartments there; as have likewi&s;e the phy&s;ician, the &s;urgeon, and the apothecary. There are in it, be&s;ides, ar&s;enals and magazines, furni&s;hed with ammunition for many years. The city of Batavia is not only inhabited by Dutch, French, Portu|gue&s;e, and other Europeans, e&s;tabli&s;hed here on account of trade; but al&s;o by a va&s;t number of Indians of different nations, Javane&s;e, Chine&s;e, Malayans, Negroes, Amboyne&s;e, Armenians, na|tives of the i&s;le of Bali, Mardykers or Topa&s;&s;es, Maca&s;&s;ars, Timors, Bougis, &amp;c. Of the Chine&s;e there are, it is &s;aid, about an hundred thou&s;and in the i&s;land; of which, near thirty thou&s;and re&s;ided in the city until the year 1740, when the Dutch, pretending that they were in a plot again&s;t them, &s;ent a body of troops into their quarter, and de|manded their arms, which the Chine&s;e readily delivered up; and the next day the governor &s;ent another body, with orders to murder and ma&s;&s;acre

Some relate there were twenty, others thirty thou&s;and, that were put to death, without any manner of trial; and yet the barbarous gover|nor, who was the in&s;trument of this cruel proceed|ing, had the a&s;&s;urance to embark for Europe, ima|gining he had ama&s;&s;ed wealth enough to &s;ecure him again&s;t any pro&s;ecution in Holland; but the Dutch, finding them&s;elves dete&s;ted and abhorred by all mankind for this piece of tyranny, endea|voured to throw the odium of it upon the governor, though he had the hands of all the council of Ba|tavia, except one, to the order for the ma&s;&s;acre. The &s;tates, therefore, di&s;patched a packet to the Cape of Good Hope, containing orders to appre|hend the governor, and &s;end him back to Batavia to be tried. He was accordingly apprehended at the Cape; but has never been heard of &s;ince. It is &s;uppo&s;ed, he was thrown over-board in his pa&s;|&s;age to Batavia, that there might be no farther en|quiries into the matter; and, it is &s;aid, all the wealth this merciful gentleman had ama&s;&s;ed, and &s;ent over before him in four &s;hips, was ca&s;t away in the pa&s;&s;age.</P>

<P>The air of Ceylon, though very hot, is not|with&s;tanding e&s;teemed to be tolerably whole|&s;ome. It is &s;ituated in the Indian Ocean, near Cape Comorin, the &s;outhern promontory of the Hither India, from which it is &s;eparated by a ve|ry narrow &s;trait, being commonly reckoned about two hundred and fifty miles long, and two hundred broad. Towards the middle it is mountainous and woody; but has a very flat coa&s;t, well planted with groves of cinnamon trees, and cocoas. The cinnamon produced here is by far the be&s;t in all A&s;ia. There are three &s;orts of it; the fine&s;t, which is taken from trees of a middling growth; a coar&s;er &s;ort, taken from the old ones; and wild cinnamon, which grows not only here, but in Ma|labar, China, and, of late years, in Bra&s;il. The na|tives,

it is &s;aid, di&s;tingui&s;h nine or ten different kinds of it; but &s;ince the Dutch have been ma&s;ters here, they propagate only the be&s;t, and prohibit all the re&s;t. The woods that furni&s;h this precious &s;pice lie mo&s;tly about Colomba, the principal Dutch &s;ettlement. What is called the Cinnamon Field, comprehending the we&s;t and &s;outh coa&s;ts of the i&s;land, between Negambo, or Nejambo, and Punta di Gallo, belongs wholly to the Dutch. The be&s;t cinnamon grows in the neighbourhood of Colom|bo and Negambo; that at Point de Galles is pret|ty good; the re&s;t middling. The trees multiply very fa&s;t, and almo&s;t without culture; but the Dutch, to keep up the value of cinnamon, ob&s;truct their propagation. The tree, according to &s;ome, has three barks, but two all people agree in; and that which they &s;trip from trees of a middling growth is the be&s;t cinnamon; neither the trees that are very young, nor tho&s;e that are very old, are proper for peeling. The body of the tree, un|der the bark, is perfectly white, and &s;erves them for building, and all manner of u&s;es; but has not the delicious ta&s;te or &s;mell that the bark has.

<HEAD>AFRICA.</HEAD>
<P>AFRICA, the third grand divi&s;ion of the globe, lies &s;outh of Europe, and we&s;t of A&s;ia, being &s;eparated from the former by the Mediterranean, and from the latter by the i&s;thmus of Suez, the Red Sea, and the Indian Ocean. On the &s;outh and we&s;t it has the Southern and Atlantic Oceans; &s;o that it may be properly &s;tiled a va&s;t overgrown penin&s;ula, joined only to the continent of A&s;ia by the i&s;thmus abovemen|tioned. It extends a prodigious way, not only on each &s;ide of the equator, but of the tropics like|wi&s;e, the &s;outhern verge of it reaching quite to the 35th degree of &s;outh, and the northern almo&s;t to 37th of north latitude; whereby its outmo&s;t ex|tent, from north to &s;outh, is almo&s;t &s;eventy-two degrees, or about four thou&s;and three hundred and twenty miles. From ea&s;t to we&s;t it reaches &s;till
<PB N="56" REF="550">
farther, viz. from &s;eventeen we&s;t, to &s;ixty ea&s;t, or &s;eventy-&s;even degrees of longitude; that is four thou&s;and &s;ix hundred and twenty miles. It is of a triangular or pyramidical form, the ba&s;e being the northern part of it, which runs along the &s;hores of the Mediterranean, and the point or top of the pyramid, the Cape of Good Hope.</P>
<P>Its &s;ituation for commerce is certainly beyond any of the other quarters of the globe, &s;tanding as it were in the centre between the other three, and having thereby a much nearer communication with Europe, A&s;ia, and America, than any of the other quarters has with the re&s;t; for it lies oppo&s;ite to Europe on the Mediterranean almo&s;t a thou&s;and miles in a line ea&s;t and we&s;t, from beyond Tri|poli to Cape Spartel at the &s;traits mouth; the di&s;|tance &s;eldom a hundred miles, no where a hun|dred leagues, and often not twenty. It is op|po&s;ite A&s;ia, all the length of the Red Sea, north and &s;outh; the di&s;tance &s;ometimes not being above five leagues, &s;eldom fifty; and it fronts all the &s;outhern coa&s;ts of A&s;ia, viz. the coa&s;ts of Cilicia, and tho&s;e of India, tho' at a greater di&s;tance, yet much nearer than any other country. It is al&s;o wonderfully accommodated for commerce, by the interpo&s;ition of i&s;lands, from Madaga&s;car to Ma|labar; and more particularly, by means of the alternate trade-winds which render the navigation &s;afe, ea&s;y, and con&s;tant. La&s;tly, it lies oppo&s;ite to America, at the di&s;tance of from five hundred to about &s;even hundred leagues, including the i&s;lands, with a coa&s;t of about two thou&s;and; whereas America no where joins Europe or A&s;ia, except perhaps by a terra incognita, and at a di&s;|tance from the former of a thou&s;and leagues, and from the latter of two thou&s;and five hundred.</P>
<P>It is furni&s;hed with the greate&s;t and mo&s;t con|venient navigable rivers, and perhaps with as many
<PB N="57" REF="560">
of them as any other of the chief parts of the globe; &s;uch as the Nile and Nubia, falling into the Mediterranean on the north; the Niger or Rio Grand, the Congo, the Zairi, and the Loango, all very large rivers, that empty them&s;elves into the At|lantic; the fir&s;t two north, and the other three &s;outh of the line: al&s;o, the Natal, the Rio St. E&s;prit, the Melinda, and the Mozambo, rivers of great length and breadth, that di&s;charge them&s;elves into the In|dian Ocean on the ea&s;t-&s;ide of Africa. Be&s;ides the&s;e, there are innumerable others, which, though not equal to the&s;e, are yet very noble &s;treams, fitted for navigation and commerce; and was this coun|try ble&s;&s;ed with a people qualified for trade and bu&s;ine&s;s, it might become the medium of an endle&s;s commercial corre&s;pondence. The &s;oil is fruitful, and the air &s;alubrious; and was a turn for indu&s;try and the arts once introduced among the natives, who are more numerous than is common|ly imagined, there would be a greater demand for the European produce and manufactures here than from any other quarter of the globe; and as in ge|neral they &s;tand in great need of European commo|dities, &s;o they have the mo&s;t valuable returns to make for them. This is not the &s;tate of trade be|tween Europe and A&s;ia: Europe calls for a va&s;t quantity of goods from A&s;ia, and A&s;ia takes little from Europe be&s;ides money; con&s;equently, that trade is carried on to the infinite advantage of the former, and to the great di&s;advantage of mo&s;t, if not all the nations of the latter, draining the whole we&s;tern world of its ready money, in return for its products and manufactures alone. However, in the main, this is not &s;uch a di&s;advantage to Eu|rope as &s;ome are inclined to think; e&s;pecially if, as &s;ome great politicians maintain, gold and &s;ilver are to be looked upon in no other light than as com|modities to be exported and imported, except in our own coin, as freely as any other what&s;oever:
<PB N="58" REF="570">
and if Europe, at pre&s;ent, contained all the gold and &s;ilver that Africa and America have ever pro|duced, it is a que&s;tion whether &s;he could be &s;aid to be ever the richer, by rea&s;on that gold and &s;ilver would then be, as it was &s;aid of Solomon's time, as plenty as the &s;tones in the &s;treets, and therefore of little or no value: &s;o that a commerce which takes off from the Europeans &s;ome part of their &s;il|ver may be as nece&s;&s;ary as any other, to keep its value in a due proportion to that of gold, which ri&s;es or falls always according to the quantity of the former.</P>
<P>With regard to the valuable returns the Africans have to make, the Europeans cannot be ignorant from that &s;hare of trade they carry on with them at pre&s;ent. That they abound in gold, we have not only the te&s;timony of the Portugue&s;e, the Dutch, and the French, as well as the Engli&s;h, who have &s;ettlements on the coa&s;t of Africa, but that of the mo&s;t authentic hi&s;torians. There is no country in the world, &s;ays Leo Africanus, richer in gold and &s;ilver than &s;ome of tho&s;e in Africa; parti|cularly Mandingo, Ethiopia, Congo, Angola, Bu|tua, Quiticui, Monomotopa, Ca&s;ati, and Mehene|mugi. By means of &s;ettlements of &s;trength on the continent of Africa, the Europeans might, by the exchange of their commodities, draw into their hands all the gold of tho&s;e countries. Here al&s;o is a prodigious number of elephants, which would not only facilitate the inland intercour&s;es of traffic, but al&s;o afford a very beneficial branch of commerce in the teeth of the&s;e valuable animals. In the above|mentioned hi&s;torian are numberle&s;s pa&s;&s;ages re|lating to the mines, and &s;hewing how ea&s;y it would be for the Europeans to carry on a very exten&s;ive trade with that part of the globe. This account of the great trea&s;ures of Africa is confirmed likewi&s;e by the Nubian geographer, who &s;ays, that the
<PB N="59" REF="580">
king of Guinea, the greate&s;t city of all the coun|tries of Negroland, has a ma&s;s of gold of thirty pounds weight, as it was naturally produced in the mines, which is perfectly pure, tough, and mal|leable, without having been &s;melted or refined, by the ordinary methods, from its native ore. Father Labat has de&s;cended to a very minute &s;pecification of a great variety of rich mines, which, he &s;ays, are very &s;hamefully worked by the negroes, by rea&s;on of their being totally ignorant of the nature of mining; and that they have never yet come to the main vein of any of their mines. Copper is the next valuable ore found in this part of the world: what plenty there is of it is not certainly known; but there is good rea&s;on to believe it is exceeding great, as it is a common &s;aying among them, that the mountains which we call Atlas, are all copper. So fertile are the fields on the northern coa&s;t in corn, that, though they are but meanly cultivated, for want of a knowledge in agriculture, they yield an hundred fold increa&s;e. The quan|tity of ivory, wax, gums, civet, and o&s;trich-fea|thers, is &s;uch in this country, that the greate&s;t de|mands might be &s;upplied without being mi&s;&s;ed; be&s;ides, with proper culture, productions might un|doubtedly be greatly multiplied and improved in the&s;e warm climates. It cannot be doubted but the fruitful rich lands every where to be found up|on the coa&s;ts, and within the country, particularly upon the banks of the rivers near the Gold Coa&s;t, and the Slave Coa&s;t, would produce all the riche&s;t articles of the Ea&s;t and We&s;t-Indies. The &s;pices of Banda, Ternate, and Amboyna, might be produced on the rich and fruitful &s;hores of Melinda, on the ea&s;t &s;ide, or of the Slave Coa&s;t on the we&s;t; and that as ea&s;ily, and to as great advantage, as where they are now, the latitude being the &s;ame, and the &s;oil not unlike. The cinnamon al&s;o of Ceylon,
<PB N="60" REF="590">
the tea of China and Japan, and the coffee of Mo|cha, it is probable, might al&s;o be rai&s;ed on the &s;ame coa&s;t; from the Rio de St. E&s;prit, &s;outhward, to the river Natal, the &s;oil and climate being tem|perate, fertile, and healthy. It has been affirmed, that the &s;ugars of Barbadoes and Jamaica, together with the ginger, cotton, rice, pepper, or pimento, the cocoa, the indigo, and every other plant which comes from the&s;e i&s;lands, might, with equal indu&s;try, be produced in as great plenty, and as good, as in America; and we are a&s;&s;ured, that in re&s;pect to ginger, cotton, and indigo, trials have been made by the Engli&s;h factories on the Gold Coa&s;t of Africa, which have &s;ucceeded to admiration. Hence it appears pretty evident, that nothing is wanting to render Africa equal, if not &s;uperior in many re&s;pects, to any of the other parts of the world: for though the middle of it, lying be|tween the tropics in the torrid zone, and under the line, is exceeding hot; yet, even in the hotte&s;t parts, it is not only habitable, but actually inhabit|ed, and the people enjoy health and plenty, and live very agreeably, having cattle, corn, cooling fruits, &s;hades, and rivers: as for in&s;tance, in the i&s;land of St. Thomas, under the very line; al&s;o on the Gold Coa&s;t, and in the kingdom of Benin and Angola, on the we&s;t &s;hore; and even on the coa&s;t of Zan|guebar, in Ethiopia, Melinda, and &s;everal of the more intemperate places on the ea&s;tern &s;hore. But making allowance for &s;ome of the inland countries remote from the &s;ea, which we are told are de&s;ti|tute of water, and therefore de&s;ert, yet the&s;e are not equal to the uninhabited wa&s;tes of Europe, A&s;ia, and America; Africa, in re&s;pect of its feel|ing no cold, having a great advantage over the other quarters of the world, and the far greater part of it enjoying the fine&s;t and mo&s;t temperate climate, as the mo&s;t northern latitude does not ex|ceed
<PB N="61" REF="600">
37, and the mo&s;t &s;outherly 35 degrees. It is however melancholy to ob&s;erve, that a country which has ten thou&s;and miles of &s;ea-coa&s;t, with noble, large, deep rivers, penetrating into the very centre of the country, &s;hould yet have no naviga|tion, nor receive any benefit from them; that it &s;hould be inhabited by an innumerable people, without knowledge of each other, corre&s;pondence, or commerce. At the mouths of the&s;e rivers are the mo&s;t excellent harbours, without number, deep, &s;afe, and calm, &s;heltered from the wind, and capable of being made perfectly &s;ecure by for|tifications; but quite de&s;titute of &s;hipping, trade, and merchants, even where there is plenty of mer|chandize. In &s;hort, Africa, though a full quarter of the globe, &s;tored with an inexhau&s;tible trea&s;ure, and capable, under proper improvements, of pro|ducing &s;o many things delightful, as well as con|venient, within it&s;elf, &s;eems to be almo&s;t entirely neglected; not only by the natives, who are quite un&s;ollicitous of reaping the benefits which nature has provided for them, but al&s;o by the more civi|lized Europeans who are &s;ettled in it, particularly the Portugue&s;e. What it produces, in its pre&s;ent rude unimproved &s;tate, &s;erves only to promote the happine&s;s of others; as if not only the inhabitants had been de&s;tined by nature to be &s;laves to their fellow-creatures, but the very land was captive, and produced its trea&s;ures merely for the benefit of the re&s;t of the world, and not for their own.</P>
<P>Whether, in&s;tead of making &s;laves of the&s;e peo|ple, it would not be more becoming tho&s;e nations that a&s;&s;ume to them&s;elves the name and character of Chri&s;tians, to give them a reli&s;h for the ble&s;&s;ings of life, by extending traffic into the country in the large&s;t degree it will admit of, and introducing among them a more civilized way of life, we &s;ub|mit to the reader's con&s;ideration. The Dutch, by
<PB N="62" REF="610">
recommending their dre&s;s, and introducing their cu&s;toms in the Spice I&s;lands, have wonderfully hu|manized the inhabitants, who were formerly as barbarous in their manners as the negroes. But, it is to be feared, this can never be brought about while the &s;lave-trade continues to be the great object of the Europeans; for that will ever &s;pirit up wars and ho&s;tilities among the negro princes and chiefs, for the &s;ake of making captives of each other for &s;ale, and thereby ob&s;truct the civilizing the natives, and extending their trade into the inte|rior parts of the country, which otherwi&s;e might be very practicable. To obtain a competent num|ber of &s;ervants to work as the negroes now do, in the colonies belonging to the &s;everal European potentates who have &s;ettlements in America, does not &s;eem at all impracticable, if proper mea&s;ures and regulations were adopted for that purpo&s;e. Eu|rope, in general, affords numberle&s;s poor di&s;tre&s;&s;ed objects, who would be glad to be provided for in that manner; and if they were not over-worked, or tyrannically treated, as the negroes generally are, they make as good, or better, &s;ervants for the planters; and were all the Europeans upon a level, in regard to the price of labour in their colonies, they would, very probably, all find their account in laying ab&s;olutely a&s;ide the &s;lave-trade, and cul|tivating a fair, friendly, humane, and civilized commerce with the Africans.</P>
<P>Africa once contained &s;everal kingdoms and &s;tates, eminent for the liberal arts, for wealth and power, and the mo&s;t exten&s;ive commerce. The kingdoms of Egypt and Ethiopia, in particular, were much celebrated; and the rich and powerful &s;tate of Carthage extended her commerce to every part of the then known world; even the Briti&s;h &s;hores were vi&s;ited by her fleets, till Juba, who was king of Mauritania, but tributary to Carthage, un|happily called in the Romans, who, with the a&s;|&s;i&s;tance
<PB N="63" REF="620">
of the Mauritanians, &s;ubdued Carthage, and, by degrees, all the other neighbouring king|doms and &s;tates. After this, the natives con&s;tant|ly plundered, and con&s;equently impoveri&s;hed, by the governors &s;ent from Rome, neglected their trade, and cultivated no more of their lands than might &s;erve for their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. Upon the de|cline of the Roman empire, in the fifth century, the north of Africa was over-run by the Vandals, a barbarous northern people, who contributed &s;till more to the de&s;truction of arts and &s;ciences; and, to add to this country's calamity, the Saracens made a &s;udden conque&s;t of all the coa&s;ts of Egypt and Barbary in the &s;eventh century: the&s;e were af|terwards &s;ucceeded by the Turks; and both the&s;e being of the Mohammedan religion, who&s;e profe&s;|&s;ors carry de&s;olation with them wherever they come, the ruin of that once flouri&s;hing part of the world was thereby compleated.</P>
<P>The inhabitants of this continent, with re&s;pect to religion, may be divided into three &s;orts; namely, Pagans, Mohammedans, and Chri&s;tians. The fir&s;t are the mo&s;t numerous, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the greate&s;t part of the country from the tropic of Cancer to the Cape of Good Hope, and the&s;e are generally black. The Mohammedans, who are of a tawny com|plexion, po&s;&s;e&s;s almo&s;t all the northern &s;hores of Africa. The people of Aby&s;&s;inia, or the Upper Ethiopia, are denominated Chri&s;tians; but retain abundance of Pagan and Jewi&s;h rites. There are &s;ome other Chri&s;tians upon the &s;ea-coa&s;ts, on al|mo&s;t every &s;ide of Africa; but their number is &s;mall, compared with that of the Pagans or Mo|hammedans. There are al&s;o &s;ome Jews on the north of Africa, who manage all the little trade that part of the country is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of. But it is very remarkable, that though the Carthaginians, who inhabited this very country of Barbary, had greater fleets, and a more extended commerce,
<PB N="64" REF="630">
than any other nation, or than all the people upon the face of the earth, when that &s;tate flouri&s;hed, the pre&s;ent inhabitants have &s;carce any merchant-&s;hips belonging to them, nor indeed any other than what Sallee, Algiers, Tunis, and Tripoli, fit out for piracy; which are but few and &s;mall, their whole &s;trength not being able to re&s;i&s;t a &s;quadron of European men of war.</P>
<P>The rea&s;ons a&s;&s;igned why many tracts in the in|terior parts of Africa are either thinly or not at all inhabited, are tho&s;e: 1. Their barrenne&s;s: 2. The &s;carcity of water, &s;ome provinces being quite de&s;ti|tute of that nece&s;&s;ary element: 3. Becau&s;e, in &s;ome &s;andy parts, the wind drives the &s;and in &s;uch pro|digious quantities, as &s;ometimes to overwhelm whole caravans. 4. Becau&s;e &s;everal of the&s;e coun|tries are infe&s;ted with a variety of wild bea&s;ts, as tygers, leopards, panthers, hyenas, rhinocero&s;e's, wild a&s;&s;es, and crocodiles, be&s;ides a prodigious number of venomous in&s;ects and reptiles.</P>
<P>There are &s;carce any two nations, or indeed any two of the learned, that agree in the modern divi|&s;ion of Africa; and for this very rea&s;on, that &s;carce any traveller has penetrated into the heart of the country, and con&s;equently we mu&s;t be content to acknowledge our ignorance of the bounds, and even the names of &s;everal of the midland nations. The&s;e may be &s;till reckoned among the unknown and undi&s;covered parts of the world; but accord|ing to the be&s;t accounts and conjectures, Africa may be commodiou&s;ly divided into the&s;e ten parts: 1. Egypt. 2. Ethiopia Superior. 3. Zanguebar, with Adel; all which lie on the ea&s;t of Africa. 4. Monoemugi, or Monamotopa, and Caffraria, called by &s;ome the Lower Ethiopia, which lie on the &s;outh. 5. Guinea, lying on the &s;outh-we&s;t. 6.

<HEAD>Its NAME, SITUATION, EXTENT, and DIVISION.</HEAD>
<P>EGYPT, called by its antient inhabitants Chemia, and by the Copts, at pre&s;ent, Chemi, was &s;o named, as is &s;uppo&s;ed, from Ham, the &s;on of Noah, being more than once &s;tiled in the book of P&s;alms, the Land of Ham; but the name by which it is generally denoted in Scripture is the Land of Mi&s;raim: from whence the Arabians, and other Oriental nations, &s;till call it Me&s;r; which the Greeks write Me&s;re, and Me&s;traea.</P>
<P>This country is be&s;t known to us by its Greek name, Egypt, the original of which is uncertain, and variou&s;ly accounted for by authors. The mo&s;t probable opinion is, that it was &s;o called from the blackne&s;s of its &s;oil, and the dark colour both of its river and inhabitants, atte&s;ted by all relations; for &s;uch a colour is called by the Greeks aegyptios, from gyps and aegyps, a vulture, a bird of that hue; and, by the Latins, &s;ubvulturius.</P>
<P>Egypt is &s;ituated between 30 and 36&deg;. of ea&s;t longitude, and 21 and 31&deg;. of north latitude; ex|tending
<PB N="66" REF="650">
in length, from north to &s;outh, about &s;ix hundred miles; and in breadth, along the coa&s;t of the Mediterranean, from ea&s;t to we&s;t, near three hundred; but, above the divi&s;ion of the Nile, it grows much narrower, &s;o that, in &s;ome places, the two chains of mountains, which ri&s;e on each &s;ide of that river, leave a plain between them of le&s;s than a days journey acro&s;s. It is bounded on the &s;outh by the kingdom of Sennar, and the cataracts of the Nile; on the north by the Mediterranean Sea; on the ea&s;t by the Arabian Gulph or Red Sea, and the I&s;thmus of Suez; and, on the we&s;t, by the De|&s;ert of Barca.</P>
<P>Antiently Egypt was u&s;ually divided into the Thebais, &s;o named by the Greeks from its princi|pal city Thebes, and at pre&s;ent much the &s;ame as the Upper Egypt, properly &s;o called, or Al-Said, the Heptanomis or Middle Egypt, and the Lower Egypt; the be&s;t part of which lay between the two arms of the Nile, and was called the Delta. The general modern divi&s;ion is al&s;o into the Upper, Middle, and Lower Egypt.</P>

<HEAD>AIR, SOIL, and PRODUCE.</HEAD>
<P>The greate&s;t part of Egypt lying in a valley, between high rocks and mountains on the ea&s;t, and the &s;andy de&s;erts of Lybia and Barca on the we&s;t, is exce&s;&s;ive hot in &s;ome months, particularly in April and May, when they are troubled al&s;o with hot winds, by which the &s;and is driven about in &s;uch clouds that the people are almo&s;t blinded, and they are then more &s;ubject to di&s;ea&s;es than during any other part of the year; but no &s;ooner does the Nile begin to ri&s;e, and overflow its banks, than all di&s;tempers, not excepting even the plague, which generally vi&s;its them once in &s;ix or &s;even years, cea&s;e. The climate of Egypt mu&s;t needs be

very warm, from its near &s;ituation to the tropic; and it &s;eldom rains in Upper Egypt, or any part of the inland country. They reckon two &s;ummers in Egypt; the fir&s;t of which, in the months of March, April, and May, is the mo&s;t unwhole&s;ome, be|cau&s;e of the unequal weather, high and parch|ing winds, which reign at that time; but in June, July, and Augu&s;t, and in their autumn and winter, the air is much cooler, the weather more con&s;tant, and Egypt one of the mo&s;t plea&s;ant and delightful countries in the world. The overflowing of the Nile, though it fertilizes the country, is yet attend|ed with one di&s;advantage, that the mud, with which it over&s;preads the be&s;t part of the country, &s;ends up a noi&s;ome vapour; but the heat and dryne&s;s of the climate &s;oon puts a &s;top to that. It is &s;aid, there are not more than two &s;prings in the whole country, to refre&s;h the parched inhabitants; &s;o that they &s;eem to be under a nece&s;&s;ity of build|ing their towns on the banks of the Nile: accord|ingly, mo&s;t of them &s;tand near the river, upon ri&s;ing ground, &s;o made by art or nature; and when the river overflows they appear like &s;o many i&s;lands, which have communication with each other only by boats. The fertility of Egypt, and the excel|lence of its productions and fruits, are greatly ce|lebrated by antient writers, and by Mo&s;es him&s;elf, who mu&s;t needs have been well acquainted with this country. It abounds in grain of all &s;orts, but particularly rice; in&s;omuch that, as it was former|ly the granary of Rome, it is now the country which chiefly &s;upplies Con&s;tantinople. The mo&s;t plentiful parts of Egypt are the Delta, and that pro|vince now called Al Feyyum, &s;uppo&s;ed to be the antient Heracleotic Nome, which is the mo&s;t fer|tile and be&s;t cultivated land in the whole kingdom, containing above three hundred and &s;ixty villages, and yielding flax, grapes, and other fruits, in abun|dance.

It fails not bearing, even in tho&s;e years when the Nile's not ri&s;ing to its u&s;ual height oc|ca&s;ions a &s;carcity in the other parts of Egypt.</P>
<P>The annual inundation of the Nile, on which the fertility of the greate&s;t part of Egypt depends, is one of the greate&s;t wonders of the country. Geographers inform us that it corre&s;ponds exactly with the rainy &s;ea&s;ons between the tropics. They commence in the mountains about the beginning of May; and the water of the Nile begins to &s;well about the middle of it; &s;o that there are fifteen days allowed by nature for the cour&s;e of the water from Ethiopia to Egypt, which is e&s;teemed a pret|ty exact allowance, the di&s;tance being from the la|titude of 13 or 15 to that of 28 or 30&deg;. But tho' the river begins to &s;well in May, yet no public no|tice is taken of it till the 28th or 29th of June, by which it is generally ri&s;en the height of &s;ix or eight pikes, a Turki&s;h mea&s;ure of about twenty-&s;ix inches; and then the public criers proclaim it through the capital, and other cities, and continue to publi&s;h, in the &s;ame manner, how much the ri|ver increa&s;es every day, until it ri&s;es to &s;ixteen pikes; and then they cut down the dam of the khalij, or great canal, at Bul&acirc;k, which pa&s;&s;es thro' the middle of Al-Kahira or Cairo, and let in the water on their lands. If the river wants but an inch of this height they will not cut down the dam; becau&s;e, in &s;uch ca&s;e, no tribute is due to the prince for the lands that &s;hould be watered by them, the produce being then &s;carce &s;ufficient to maintain the tillers. And therefore, at pre&s;ent, if the ba&s;ha or governor of Egypt cuts the dam before the river ri&s;es to that determinate height, he is an&s;werable for the con&s;equence, and mu&s;t pay the Turki&s;h emperor his tribute, whether the year be plentiful or not. If the water runs to the height of twenty-three or twenty-four pikes, it is judged mo&s;t favourable; but, if it
<PB N="69" REF="680">
exceeds that, it does a great deal of mi&s;chief, not only by overthrowing hou&s;es and drowning cattle, but al&s;o by engendering a great number of in&s;ects, which de&s;troy the fruits of the earth. As to the continuance of the inundation, it depends, as we ob&s;erved with re&s;pect to its ri&s;e, on the rains in Ethiopia, which begin to abate at the beginning of September, and cea&s;e by the beginning of Octo|ber. Hence, about a fortnight after the rains be|gins to abate in Ethiopia, the inundation of the ri|ver begins to abate in Egypt; and, ten days after the rains cea&s;e in Ethiopia, the Nile is quite reduced to its antient channel in Egypt. This being the ca&s;e, there can be no room any longer to doubt of the rains in Ethiopia being the cau&s;e of the inun|dation. The khalij or canal, above-mentioned, is always opened with great &s;olemnity, in the pre|&s;ence of the ba&s;ha, accompanied by all the great officers, and attended by an innumerable multitude of people; this being now one of the greate&s;t fe&s;ti|vals in Egypt, as it was in former times.</P>
<P>That they may the better judge of the daily in|crea&s;e of the water, and the con&s;equent plenty or &s;carcity of the en&s;uing year, the gradual ri&s;e of the water is very exactly mea&s;ured, either by wells &s;unk, or pillars erected and divided for that pur|po&s;e. A very antient column, which &s;erved for that u&s;e, is yet to be &s;een in the ca&s;tle of Old Cai|ro, &s;aid to have been erected in the time of the em|peror Heraclius. The pre&s;ent Nilomiter, or Mi|kyas, as the Arabs call it, is in the &s;ame ca&s;tle. It is a large &s;quare re&s;ervoir, round which runs a hand&s;ome gallery, &s;u&s;tained by twelve marble pil|lars, which form arches, with a balu&s;trade, for the convenience of tho&s;e who look into the water. In the mid&s;t of the ba&s;on, through which pa&s;&s;es a ca|nal drawn from the Nile, is an octagonal pillar of white marble, divided into twenty-two equal parts.
<PB N="70" REF="690">
They are very careful during the inundation to ob|&s;erve the height of the water by the mea&s;ure, and to proclaim it in the city. This work is &s;o exactly fini&s;hed, and nicely levelled, that the water in the re&s;ervoir is neither higher nor lower than that in the river. Be&s;ides this, there is another nilometer, built in an i&s;land of the Nile, between Jiz&acirc;h and Al-Fo&s;&s;et. As the river could not of it&s;elf over|flow the lands every where in the nece&s;&s;ary propor|tion, the inhabitants have been obliged, with infi|nite labour, to cut a va&s;t number of canals and trenches, from one end of Egypt to the other, to convey the water to every part; &s;o that each town and village has its canal, which is opened at the proper time, and the water &s;ucce&s;&s;ively conduct|ed to the mo&s;t di&s;tant places. It is &s;aid al&s;o, that above two hundred thou&s;and oxen are daily employed throughout Egypt in drawing water, by engines, from the canals and wells, to water the higher grounds, gardens, and fruit-trees, without reckoning the men who draw water in wicker ba&s;kets, &s;o clo&s;e and well made that not a drop runs through.</P>
<P>The Nile differing in this from other rivers, which generally carry off the heart of the land they over|flow, by the mud and &s;lime it brings down with it, fattens the earth, and makes it exceeding fruitful, without any manure. The Egyptians have not the laborious ta&s;k of plowing, digging, or breaking the clods; but, when the river is retired, they have no more to do than to mingle a little &s;and with the earth, to abate its &s;trength, after which they &s;ow with little pains, and almo&s;t without charge. They begin to &s;ow ordinarily in October and November, as the waters fall; within two months the ground is co|vered with all &s;orts of grain and pul&s;e; and their har|ve&s;t is in March and April. The &s;ame piece of ground produces, the &s;ame year, three or four different
<PB N="71" REF="700">
&s;orts of grain and pul&s;e, and of every thing that gardens afford: fir&s;t they &s;ow lettuce and cucum|bers, then corn, and, after harve&s;t, melons, and tho&s;e &s;orts of pul&s;e that are peculiar to Egypt.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides all manner of grain, peas, beans, rice, flax, hemp, melons, oranges, lemons, &s;ugar-canes, dates, plantains, grapes, figs, and palm trees, from which wine is made, Egypt produces the riche&s;t pa&s;ture, and abounds in flocks and herds; which are turned out to graze in November, and continue at gra&s;s till the flood returns. The cows here, it is &s;aid, always bring two calves at a time, and &s;heep yean twice a-year, having two lambs the fir&s;t time, and one the &s;econd; and a goat is often &s;een fol|lowed by four kids, which &s;he has brought in &s;ix months. The pa&s;tures in Egypt are mo&s;t excel|lent, the gra&s;s generally growing to the height of the cattle: on this they feed in winter, during which &s;ea&s;on, great numbers are driven thither from about the Euphrates. In &s;ummer, the grounds being either burnt up by the &s;un, or overflowed by the Nile, they are taken up, and fed with hay, beans, and barley.</P>
<P>The &s;urpri&s;ing fecundity occa&s;ioned by the over|flowing of the Nile, we are told, reaches not only to the earth and to brute animals, but al&s;o to man|kind; and that it hath been found, by con&s;tant expe|rience, that the new waters make the women fruit|ful, whether they bathe in them, or only drink them.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t remarkable animals of Egypt, be&s;ides tho&s;e we have already mentioned, are the crocodile, the hippopotamos, the little or land crocodile, wild oxen, camels, a&s;&s;es, antelopes, a large kind of ape, with a head &s;omewhat like a dog, whence it was antiently called by the Greeks cynocephalus, the chameleon, and the Egyptian rat, called, by the antients, ichneumon.</P>
<P><PB N="72" REF="710">
The crocodiles are often killed by the natives. One way of taking them is, by a piece of fle&s;h &s;tuck on a hook, and let down into the river by a rope, the other end of which is fa&s;tened to a &s;take: when the crocodile has &s;eized the bait, he is drawn to land and killed. Another more dangerous way is &s;ome|times practi&s;ed, by &s;triking them, as they &s;leep, under the belly, with a &s;take armed with a bearded point of iron, and al&s;o fa&s;tened to a &s;take.</P>
<P>The hippopotami are common in Upper-Egypt, e&s;pecially near the cataracts; but they are &s;carce ever &s;een in the Lower-Egypt. It is larger than an ox, the hinder part much like one, and its head like a hor&s;e; having thick large feet, with claws, and a tail like an elephant. It is an amphibious animal, comes out of the river, and feeds on the gra&s;s in the meadows, but is exceeding &s;hy.</P>
<P>They have an extraordinary breed of a&s;&s;es here, which will perform a journey well; and the Chri&s;|tians, it is &s;aid, are not &s;uffered to ride on any other bea&s;t. A traveller hires the owner of the bea&s;t, or his &s;ervant, as well as the a&s;s, who trots after the bea&s;t, and pricks him along with a kind of goad.</P>
<P>The animal called the little or land crocodile, &s;up|po&s;ed to be the &s;cincus of Pliny, is about the big|ne&s;s of a lizard, and has a round tail covered with &s;cales. It is found near the Nile and the Red Sea, and u&s;ually feeds on the mo&s;t odoriferous flowers. The fle&s;h is of u&s;e in phy&s;ic, great numbers of them being, for that rea&s;on, carried to Venice, and other places.</P>
<P>The Egyptian rat, called by the antients ichneu|mon, is of the &s;ize of a cat, with very rough hair, &s;potted with white, yellow, and a&s;h colour; its no&s;e like that of a hog, with which it digs up the earth. It has &s;hort black legs, and a tail like a fox. It lives on lizards, &s;erpents, &s;nails, chame|leons,
<PB N="73" REF="720">
rats, &amp;c. and is of great &s;ervice in Egypt, by its natural in&s;tinct, hunting out, and breaking the eggs of the crocodiles, and thereby preventing too great an increa&s;e of that de&s;tructive animal. The naturali&s;ts al&s;o &s;ay, that it is &s;o greedy after the crocodile's liver, that rolling it&s;elf in mud, it &s;lips down his throat, while he &s;leeps with his mouth open, and gnaws its way out again. It is ea&s;ily tamed, but mu&s;t not be kept where cats are, with which it is at perpetual enmity.</P>
<P>The chameleon is a little animal, &s;omething re&s;embling a lizard, that changes colour as you &s;tand'to look at it.</P>
<P>Of birds there are al&s;o great numbers in Egypt, particularly o&s;triches, eagles, hawks, and a prodi|gious number of water fowl, as pelicans, flamingos, or phaenicopteri, wild gee&s;e, herons, ducks, and various other &s;orts. Tho&s;e which are peculiar to the Nile, are the ibis, the goo&s;e with golden fea|thers, the rice-hen, or hen of Dimyat, and the &s;ak|&s;ak; which la&s;t is the trochilus of the antients, ob|&s;erved by them to be the only creature with which the crocodile is in friend&s;hip; becau&s;e this bird pecks and clears his mouth of the leeches which infe&s;t it. The ibis de&s;erves particular notice, not only be|cau&s;e it is &s;o peculiar to Egypt, that it pines away and dies, if carried el&s;ewhere, but for the great u&s;e it is of in that country, by de&s;troying the flying &s;erpents, which the &s;outh wind brings from the de&s;erts of Lybia, and are &s;haped like the water|&s;nakes, with wings like a bat: in the proper &s;ea&s;on of the year, the&s;e birds, in va&s;t numbers, by a pe|culiar in&s;tinct, go and wait on the frontiers for the&s;e &s;erpents, and devour them as they fly, before they enter Egypt. There are two kinds of the ibis; one of a deep black, and about the bigne&s;s of a heron: this is the ibis, which kills the &s;erpents, and is &s;eldom found, except only in the Lower Egypt:
<PB N="74" REF="730">
the other is white, but has the head, neck, and ends of the wings and tail as black as the former; the&s;e are very common, and great numbers of them are often &s;een. The bill and legs of this bird re&s;emble tho&s;e of a &s;tork: its u&s;ual food (be&s;ides the &s;erpents a|bovementioned) are &s;nails, locu&s;ts, and other in|&s;ects.</P>
<P>The o&s;trich is very common in the de&s;erts of Egypt, as well as tho&s;e of Arabia. They are the talle&s;t fowls we meet with any where, and will &s;trike a blow like a hor&s;e, with their hind feet. Their backs are &s;haped almo&s;t like a camel's, and they run a prodigious pace, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by their wings, which are of little u&s;e to them in flying, for they can &s;carce rai&s;e them&s;elves from the ground, and the Arabs frequently ride them down.</P>
<P>The &s;erpent called the ba&s;ili&s;k, or cokatrice, who&s;e very eyes dart certain death, if we may credit the antients, is al&s;o &s;aid to be found in Egypt; but this may be &s;uppo&s;ed to be only a &s;imile of the antient poets, to illu&s;trate, how fatally young men are frequently allured and captivated by the eyes of &s;ome fair charmer to their de&s;truction. The a&s;p is another little &s;erpent found al&s;o in this country, by who&s;e bite the celebrated Cleopatra and her ladies cho&s;e to die, the poi&s;on operating &s;uddenly, and throwing the party into a deep &s;leep; tho' &s;ome who have been wounded by it, are &s;aid to have died in a laughing fit, and others weeping.</P>

<HEAD>CURIOSITIES and ANTIQUITIES of EGYPT.</HEAD>
<P>Be&s;ides the regular inundation of the Nile, and the rare animals mentioned above, there are &s;eve|ral other things for which Egypt is remarkable, particularly the pyramids, the mummy pits, the &s;phinx, the labyrinth, the lake Maeris, the cataracts
<PB N="75" REF="740">
of the Nile, the hatching of chickens in ovens, the papyrus, or byblus, of which they antiently made paper, the lotus, and &s;ome others.</P>
<P>The pyramids, which &s;tand three or four leagues to the we&s;tward of Cairo, near the &s;ite of the an|tient Memphis, are the grande&s;t pieces of antiquity now remaining on the face of the earth. The ba&s;e of the large&s;t covers eleven acres of ground, and is five hundred feet high, mea&s;ured perpendi|cularly, and &s;even hundred, if mea&s;ured obliquely from the bottom of the ba&s;e to the top, which may reconcile the different relations we meet with of its height; tho' Dr. Shaw ob&s;erves, the &s;ands are blown up &s;o high on the &s;ides, that it is impo&s;&s;ible to take the height of it exactly. There is a room in it thirty four feet long, and &s;eventeen broad, in which is a marble che&s;t &s;even feet long, which &s;ome &s;uppo&s;e to be a coffin, in which the body of &s;ome antient king was depo&s;ited.</P>
<P>There are two others near as large as the fir&s;t, and at no great di&s;tance from it, with many more di&s;per&s;ed about the Lybian De&s;ert, to the amount of twenty, but mo&s;t of them much inferior in bulk to the&s;e three. By whom the&s;e pyramids were built, or when, or for what end, is not yet &s;ettled.</P>
<P>The mummy pits are in the Lybian De&s;erts, three or four leagues di&s;tant from the three great pyra|mids. They are &s;ubteraneous vaults of a va&s;t extent, above thirty feet deep, having large &s;quare allies, on the &s;ides whereof the Egyptians u&s;ed to bury their dead, by &s;etting the coffin upright in niches, after the embalmed corps was put into it. Some of the che&s;ts or coffins in which the mummies or embalmed bodies lie, are of wood, &s;ome of &s;tone, and others only of pieces of linen cloth gummed or glued together, which are as &s;trong the wooden ones. With the&s;e mummies are u&s;ual|ly found the figures of birds and bea&s;ts, and little
<PB N="76" REF="750">
images of &s;everal &s;orts, &s;ome made of copper, others of &s;tone, and others of &s;everal kinds of earth. Near the large&s;t pyramid &s;tands what is u&s;ually called the &s;phinx, which if entire, &s;hould re&s;emble a woman in the upper part, and in the lower a lion. By this figure the Egyptians in their hieroglyphics repre&s;ented a harlot; intimating the danger of being &s;mitten by a beautiful faithle&s;s woman, whom the fond lover would probably, in the end, find as cruel and ra|pacious as a lion. Nothing more of this figure is now di&s;cernible, but from the &s;houlders upwards, and yet it is near thirty feet in height. Some think it was hewn out of the rock on which it &s;tands, and that there was never any more of it than we &s;ee at pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>The labyrinth is another curio&s;ity. It lies to|wards the Upper Egypt, near the banks of the Nile. Mo&s;t part of it is under ground, formed out of a marble rock, and con&s;i&s;ting of twelve palaces, and a thou&s;and hou&s;es, with &s;o many intricate turnings and windings, that it was impo&s;&s;ible for a &s;tranger to find his way thro', or get back again, if he had entered it without a guide.</P>
<P>The lake Maeris was dug by a king of Egypt, called by Herodotus Maeris, and by Diodorus My|ris, who&s;e name it afterwards received, to correct the irregularities of the Nile, by receiving the &s;u|perfluous waters, when the river ro&s;e too high, and &s;upplying water for the lands, when the river failed. The inhabitants, at pre&s;ent, call this lake the lake of Charon. There is an i&s;le in the mid|dle of it, of about a league in circumference; but nothing is to be &s;een of the two pyramids which were built here, tho' they &s;ay there are &s;everal ruins of temples and tombs, with large figures of men and animals. The canals and ditches that were cut from the main channel, by which the lake com|municated with the Nile, are &s;till &s;ub&s;i&s;ting, and
<PB N="77" REF="760">
almo&s;t entire at this day, their number and &s;truc|ture being worthy of admiration.</P>
<P>As to the cataracts of the Nile, which both an|tients and moderns have magnified &s;o extravagant|ly, telling us, that the water falls from a prodigi|ous height, and that people are deafened with the noi&s;e of it, Dr. Shaw a&s;&s;ures us that they are only ordinary falls of water, &s;uch as we frequently meet with on great rivers, where the &s;tream is a little confined, and that they are navigable, &s;o that a boat may pa&s;s them &s;afely; but whether the Doc|tor &s;aw them at the height of the flood, or when the river was low, he does not inform us, and this mu&s;t certainly occa&s;ion a great difference.</P>
<P>The grots in a mountain near O&s;y&ucirc;t ought not to be pa&s;&s;ed over in &s;ilence. It is &s;aid there are above a thou&s;and of them, each more &s;ingular and beau|tiful than another. One of them is large enough to contain &s;ix hundred hor&s;e in battle array. It is cut out of the rock by the chi&s;&s;el, and &s;upported by va&s;t &s;quare pillars of the &s;ame rock. In the&s;e grottoes various apartments have been made, and &s;ome wells &s;unk; and at the further end there are catacombs hollowed in the rocks, where are a great number of mummies, and tombs adorned with &s;culptures in ba&s;&s;o relievo, which have been almo&s;t disfigured by the Arabs.</P>
<P>As to the reed papyrus, or byblus, called at pre&s;ent by the natives al-berbi, whereof the antients made their writing-paper, and from which ours took its name; it grows on the banks of the Nile, and &s;hoots out a &s;talk of long &s;trait fibres, with leaves like the blade of a &s;word. The way of manufac|turing it antiently was by taking out the pith of the &s;talk, which they worked into a white pa&s;te or glew, and of that made the paper, almo&s;t in the &s;ame manner as we do with linen rags; but others &s;ay it was made of the inner rind of the plant. Be|fore
<PB N="78" REF="770">
agriculture was improved in Egypt, this reed was of great &s;ervice; for they not only u&s;ed it as food, but made cloaths, boats, and dome&s;tic uten&s;ils of it; and al&s;o crowns for their gods, and &s;hoes for their prie&s;ts: but more u&s;eful inventions have &s;et all this a&s;ide, and the plant is now en|tirely neglected.</P>
<P>The paper of the Romans never exceeded thir|teen fingers breath, and this was their fine&s;t and mo&s;t beautiful &s;ort. It was &s;leeked with a tooth or &s;hell, and this kept it from &s;oaking the ink, and made it gli&s;ten. The Egyptian papyrus &s;eems even to have been known in the time of Homer; but it was not according to Varro, 'till about the time of Alexander the Great, that it began to be ma|nufactured to any degree of perfection. Paper made of the rind of this plant was that which was chiefly u&s;ed 'till the 10th century; when &s;ome body invented the making of it with pounded cotton reduced into a pulp. This method, known in Chi|na &s;everal ages before, appeared at la&s;t in the em|pire of the Ea&s;t; yet without any certain know|ledge of the author, or the time and place of the invention. All public acts and diplomas were written on the Egyptian paper, till the 11th cen|tury; and it is probable that linen-rag paper was invented &s;ome time in that century, as then the Egyptian paper began to be di&s;u&s;ed in the We&s;t, and that of cotton in the Ea&s;t. However, there is no finding an exact date to this di&s;covery; for not|with&s;tanding the mo&s;t diligent &s;earch of the learn|ed antiquary Montfaucon, both in France and Italy, he could never find a book or leaf of paper, &s;uch as is now u&s;ed, 'till towards the end of the 13th century.</P>
<P>The lotus grows plentifully in Egypt, e&s;pecially near Ra&s;h&icirc;d or Ro&s;etta. It is called by the inha|bitants al-bahnin, and is a &s;pecies of nymphaea or
<PB N="79" REF="780">
water lilly. Its leaves float on the water, and co|ver the &s;urface of it, producing many flowers, which were formerly wove into the crowns of conquerors. The antient Egyptians made bread of the middle or pulp dried, and likewi&s;e fed on the root, which is round, and as big as an apple. This lotus is dif|ferent from the fruit of the &s;ame name, whereon the lotophagi lived. The Arabs at this day make a drink of the Egyptian lotus, which is very good for inward heat; and eat the &s;talk and heads of them raw, which are very moi&s;t and cooling.</P>
<P>Another curio&s;ity, for which Egypt is famed, is hatching of chickens in ovens. Many thou&s;ands are &s;o hatched here every year, the ovens in which the eggs are laid being covered and heated with hor&s;e-dung, with &s;o temperate a warmth, and &s;o exactly re&s;embling that of a hen, that chickens are at length formed and hatched. Succe&s;sful ex|periments of the &s;ame kind have been made both in Italy and France; in the latter particularly by M. Bau&s;&s;an du Bignon, who made u&s;e of fermented tan in&s;tead of hor&s;e-dung.</P>
<P>The&s;e are the principal curio&s;ities and antiqui|ties in Egypt; but there are many others, e&s;peci|ally antiquities, and that chiefly in Upper Egypt, &s;ome of which we &s;hall take notice of in our ac|count of the towns, but have no room to enlarge upon.</P>

<HEAD>Of the pre&s;ent INHABITANTS of EGYPT.</HEAD>
<P>Egypt is inhabited by &s;everal different &s;orts of people, as Turks, Arabs, Moors, Copts, Greeks, Jews, and Franks. They differ in their &s;tature, complexion, habits, and way of life. The Turks are tall, fair, per&s;onable men, and cloathed as in Turky. The Arabs are a &s;warthy, &s;mall-limbed people, and live in tents all over the country,
<PB N="80" REF="790">
pitched in a circular form, which kind of village they call a dowar: they lie upon mats, and the blankets they wrap about them in the day-time, &s;erve for a covering in the night. Both Turks and Arabs ri&s;e very early, con&s;tantly attending the public devotions at break of day, again at noon, at &s;un-&s;et, and at &s;etting of the watch, when it begins to be dark. The Moors and common people, who are natives of the country, are almo&s;t as &s;warthy as the Arabs in this hot climate; and they are gene|rally an ill-looked people, and very &s;lovenly, e&s;pe|cially the Copts. The Egyptian women, that are not expo&s;ed to the &s;un, have fine complexions, as well as features. All of them in general are very frugal in their diet.</P>
<P>It was from hence that the vagrant race called gyp&s;ies came, and di&s;per&s;ed them&s;elves into every kingdom of Europe and A&s;ia. They were origi|nally called Zinganees, from their captain Zinganeus; who, when &s;ultan Selim made a conque&s;t of Egypt, about the year 1517, refu&s;ed to &s;ubmit to the Turki&s;h yoke, and retired into the de&s;erts, where they lived by rapine and plunder, and frequently came down into the plains of Egypt, committing great outrages in the towns upon the Nile, under the dominion of the Turks. But being at length &s;ubdued, and bani&s;hed Egypt, they agreed to di&s;|per&s;e them&s;elves in &s;mall parties, into every coun|try of the known world; and as they were natives of Egypt, a country where the occult &s;ciences, or black art, as it was called, was &s;uppo&s;ed to have arrived to great perfection, and which, in that cre|dulous age, was in great vogue with per&s;ons of all religions and per&s;ua&s;ions, they found no difficulty to maintain them&s;elves, by pretending to tell for|tunes and future events.</P>
<P>Jugglers, fortune-tellers, ballad-&s;ingers, and &s;uch &s;ort of vermin, are &s;till very common in
<PB N="81" REF="800">
Egypt as well as in other countries; but what &s;eems peculiar to the&s;e of Egypt is, their dancing camels, which are taught to dance by being &s;et upon a heated floor: this giving them a great deal of pain, they lift up their legs as if they were dancing, a fellow beating on a drum at the &s;ame time; hence, whenever the animal hears a drum, he falls a dancing. Their fortunetellers breed up birds, who are taught to carry little &s;crolls of pa|per from their ma&s;ters to tho&s;e who come to en|quire what luck they &s;hall have, in which is found his good or bad fortune written, to which great faith is given.</P>
<P>The antient language of Egypt was the Coptic, which continued in u&s;e 'till the conque&s;t of the country by Alexander the Great, who introduced the Greek among them, which continued to be &s;poken there above nine hundred years, that is, till the Greeks were driven out of it by the Arabs; &s;ince which the Arabe&s;k, or vulgar Arabic hath been the common language in it; and next to that, the Turki&s;h, modern Greek, and Coptic.</P>
<P>As to religion, the Turks, Moors, and Arabs, are Mohammedans, only it is ob&s;erved, that the Moors and Arabs, who at pre&s;ent make up the bulk of the people, are much more &s;uper&s;titious and zealous in their way, than the other Moham|medans; and have their &s;antos or puritans among them, for whom they expre&s;s an extraordinary ve|neration; but the Turks de&s;pi&s;e the&s;e hypocrites. Many of the&s;e &s;antos go perfectly naked about the &s;treets, without the lea&s;t rag to cover them, &s;uffer|ing the hair all over their bodies to grow to a great length. In this condition they vi&s;it the hou&s;es of per&s;ons of di&s;tinction, and &s;it down to dinner with them without any invitation, and leave their table with as little ceremony as they entered;
<PB N="82" REF="810">
and it is looked upon as no &s;mall ble&s;&s;ing to a hou&s;e to receive a vi&s;it from the&s;e people.</P>
<P>The antient Egyptians were the mo&s;t &s;uper&s;ti|tious people in the world, and wor&s;hipped not on|ly the planets, but &s;everal &s;orts of birds and bea&s;ts, as the crocodile, the ichneumon, the ibis, &amp;c. but the bea&s;t they mo&s;t adored was a black ox, under the name of apis: nay they wor&s;hipped even in|animate things, &s;uch as leeks and onions.</P>
<P>The Copts, who are &s;uppo&s;ed to be of the an|tient Egyptian race, are a &s;ort of Chri&s;tians, ac|cording to the here&s;y of Dio&s;corus, one of their antient patriarchs. It is generally held, that St. Mark fir&s;t planted Chri&s;tianity in this country, and was the fir&s;t bi&s;hop of Alexandria, then the me|tropolis of Egypt.</P>
<P>The juri&s;diction of this bi&s;hop was &s;ettled by the council of Nice over all the churches of the dioce&s;e of Egypt, which included Lybia, Pentapolis, and Egypt properly &s;o called; and afterwards the E|thiopian or Aby&s;&s;ine churches became &s;ubject to the patriarch of Alexandria, and have ever &s;ince acknowledged a relation to him.</P>
<P>The Copts differ from the church of Rome in admini&s;tering the &s;acrament of the Lord's &s;upper in both kinds; and allow neither extreme unction, nor the euchari&s;t to be admini&s;tered to the &s;ick. Neither do they agree with that church in the points of purgatory, or praying for the dead. They are however far from being orthodox Chri&s;|tians.</P>

<HEAD>Of the ANTIENT HISTORY and pre&s;ent GO|VERNMENT of EGYPT.</HEAD>
<P>The Egyptians are certainly a very antient na|tion, tho' far from being &s;o antient as they make them&s;elves, when they give us a catalogue of
<PB N="83" REF="820">
their princes, &s;ome of whom, according to them, mu&s;t have lived &s;everal thou&s;and years before the creation. But if, as hath been &s;uppo&s;ed by &s;ome, the Egyptians, by years, did not intend the periodical revolution of the &s;un, but only of the moon, their chronology in that ca&s;e might be con&s;i&s;tent enough with the &s;cripture and truth; but otherwi&s;e, as hath been long &s;ince ob&s;erved of the Chine&s;e and other people, who run up their original &s;o very high, it confutes it&s;elf, as no to|lerable account or hi&s;tory is given us of tho&s;e pre|tended times; but on the contrary, the invention of all arts and &s;ciences, even of agriculture, is placed about the &s;ame times as in our hi&s;tories; which could not po&s;&s;ibly have been the ca&s;e, had the world been as old as they &s;ugge&s;t, as it can not be conceived, how men could live any time in a regular &s;ociety without them.</P>
<P>That this country was planted very early, and &s;oon after the di&s;per&s;ion of the people at the tower of Babel cannot be di&s;puted. Cham, or Ham, the &s;on of Noah, is generally held to be the &s;ame with Jupiter Ammon; and Mi&s;raim his grand&s;on, the &s;ame with O&s;iris, the great deity of the Egyptians; and from him, it is &s;aid, de&s;cended that race of monarchs, who had the general denomination of Pharaoh; but from whom, or how, that denomi|nation took its ri&s;e, no &s;atisfactory account can be given.</P>
<P>There are reckoned above &s;ixty princes of the Iine of the&s;e Pharaohs, and they reigned, it is &s;aid, in an uninterrupted &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to the year of the world 3435, when Pharaoh P&s;ammiticus, the &s;e|cond monarch of that name, was conquered by Camby&s;es II. king of Per&s;ia, who united Egypt to that empire, under which it remained till the reign of Darius, being upwards of a hundred years, when it revolted from that crown, and became
<PB N="84" REF="830">
again an independent kingdom under Amyrteus, in which &s;tate it continued about fifty years, when Ochus, king of Per&s;ia, recovered the dominion of it again; and it continued a part of that empire 'till Alexander the Great vanqui&s;hed Darius, when it fell under the dominion of that prince, with the other provinces of the Per&s;ian empire.</P>
<P>After the death of Alexander, Ptolemy, the &s;on of Lagus, or, as others in&s;inuate, the &s;on of Philip of Macedon, and con&s;equently half-brother of A|lexander, found means to mount the throne of Egypt, and render it an independent kingdom once again. His &s;ucce&s;&s;ors ever after retained the name of Ptolemy; and this line continued be|tween two and three hundred years, the la&s;t &s;o|vereign being the famous Cleopatra, wife and &s;i&s;ter to Ptolemy Diony&s;ius, the la&s;t king, and &s;ucce&s;&s;ively mi&s;tre&s;s to Julius Cae&s;ar and Mark Antony.</P>
<P>It was Ptolemy Philadelphus, &s;on of the fir&s;t Ptolemy, who collected the Alexandrian library, &s;aid to con&s;i&s;t of &s;even hundred thou&s;and volumes, and the &s;ame prince cau&s;ed the &s;criptures to be tran&s;lated into Greek; but whether by &s;eventy-two interpreters, and in the manner commonly related, is ju&s;tly que&s;tioned. The Ptolemies &s;ometimes extended their dominions over great part of Syria, and were frequently at war with the kings of Syria, in which they met with various &s;ucce&s;s. After the death of Cleopatra this kingdom fell under the power of the Romans, and continued a Roman province 'till the reign of Heraclius, the emperor of Con&s;iantinople; when the people, being di&s;gu&s;t|ed with their governor, called in Omar the third caliph of the Saracens, and &s;ubmitted them&s;elves to the Mohammedan power about the year 640. But &s;urely the admini&s;tration of the Greek emperors mu&s;t have been grievous, which could induce a
<PB N="85" REF="840">
Chri&s;tian nation to make choice of a Mohammedan for their &s;overeign.</P>
<P>The caliphs of Babylon were &s;overeigns here, till about the year 870, when the Egyptians &s;et up a caliph of their own, called the caliph of Cairo, to whom the Saracens of Africa and Spain were &s;ub|ject; but the governors of the provinces, or &s;ultans under the caliphs of Babylon and Cairo, &s;oon wre&s;ted the civil power out of the hands of their caliphs, or high-prie&s;ts, leaving them only a &s;hadow of &s;overeignty.</P>
<P>About the year 1160 A&s;&s;areddin, or Saracen, ge|neral of Narradin, the Saracen &s;ultan of Dama&s;cus, &s;ubdued the kingdom of Egypt, and u&s;urped the dominion of it; being &s;ucceeded in the kingdom by his &s;on Saladin, who reduced al&s;o the kingdom of Dama&s;cus, Me&s;opotamia, and Pale&s;tine, under his power; and about the year 1190, took Jeru|&s;alem from the Chri&s;tians. It was this prince who e&s;tabli&s;hed a body of troops in Egypt like the pre|&s;ent Jani&s;aries, compo&s;ed of the &s;ons of Chri&s;tians taken in war, and purcha&s;ed of the Tartars, to whom he gave the name of Malmalukes, which &s;ignifies no more than &s;lave. Among the forces in|deed of the Mohammedan princes, the title of &s;lave is very honourable, as denoting one who is entirely devoted to the &s;ervice of the &s;overeign, and con&s;equently is intitled to greater privileges than other &s;ubjects. The po&s;terity of A&s;&s;areddin enjoyed the crown till the year 1242, when the Mamalukes depo&s;ed Elmutan, as they had done his father Melech A&s;&s;alach &s;ome years before, and &s;et one of their own officers on the throne, who&s;e name was Turquemenius. He, and his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, were engaged in continual wars with the Chri&s;tians in Syria and Pale&s;tine, till Araphus, the &s;ixth &s;ul|tan, entirely di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the Chri&s;tians of the Holy Land. The ninth &s;ultan, Melechna&s;&s;ar, &s;ubdued
<PB N="86" REF="850">
the i&s;land of Cyprus, and made it tributary to Egypt. About the year 1501, Camp&s;on Gaurus, the fifteenth &s;ultan of the Mamalukes, entering in|to an alliance with I&s;mael, the Sophi of Per&s;ia, again&s;t Selim III. emperor, and tenth king of the Ottoman family, the confederates received &s;eve|ral memorable defeats; and Tonombeius II. who &s;ucceeded Camp&s;on Gaurus, was depo&s;ed and murdered by Selim, and, according to &s;ome ac|counts, hanged up at one of the gates of Grand Cairo. Gazelle, one of the grandees of the Ma|malukes, maintained a war for &s;ome time again&s;t Selim, but was at length defeated, and Egypt made a province of the Ottoman empire. The Mamaluke &s;ultans were always cho&s;en by a majo|rity of Mamalukes out of their own body, who were &s;o jealous of the kingdom's being made he|reditary, that they &s;carce ever elected the &s;on of the preceding &s;ultan; and if the choice ever happened to fall on &s;uch a one, they were &s;o apprehen&s;ive of its being made a handle to introduce hereditary &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, that they never re&s;ted till they depo&s;ed him.</P>
<P>Since the Ottoman emperors have had the do|minion of this kingdom, they have always govern|ed it by a viceroy, &s;tiled the ba&s;haw of Grand Ca|rio; but as Egypt is dwindled into &s;everal princi|palities, the princes whereof are a &s;ort of petty &s;o|vereigns in their re&s;pective territories, the ba&s;haw tran&s;acts nothing of importance without their con|currence. The grand &s;eignior has never attempt|ed to deprive the&s;e princes of their privileges, for fear of the revolt of this rich province, which is now e&s;teemed the granary of Con&s;tantinople, as it was antiently of Rome; e&s;pecially as the fertility of it is, in a great mea&s;ure, owing to the right of inheritance which the Egyptians enjoy in their lands, in con&s;equence of their being &s;till governed
<PB N="87" REF="860">
by their own princes under the emperor; a right which very few of the &s;ubjects of the Porte enjoy be&s;ides. The Turki&s;h government, therefore, takes care not to exa&s;perate the Egyptians, by over|loading them with taxes; &s;o that, except what the viceroy, and his creatures, illegally extort from them, the whole revenue rai&s;ed by the govern|ment does not amount to a million of our money, of which two thirds are &s;pent within the kingdom, and not more than one-third comes into the grand &s;eignior's trea&s;ury.</P>
<P>The ba&s;&s;a of Grand Cario has a good body of jani&s;aries, and other forces, under his command, the better to pre&s;erve the dependence of the Egyp|tian princes on the Porte; but his policy in creating divi&s;ions among tho&s;e princes, contri|butes more to the e&s;tabli&s;hment of his power than his army; and notwith&s;tanding all the Turki&s;h arts, tho&s;e princes &s;ometimes depo&s;e the ba&s;&s;a, and compel the grand &s;eignior to &s;end them another governor more acceptable to them. As to foreign enemies, the Egyptians have none at pre&s;ent; but they are frequently engaged in civil wars among them&s;elves, or in conte&s;ts with the Turki&s;h ba&s;&s;as.</P>

<HEAD>TRAFFIC.</HEAD>
<P>The traffic of Egypt is chiefly carried on by the caravans. There is al&s;o a con&s;iderable ex|portation from the towns &s;ituated on the Me|diterranean, and from Suez on the Red Sea. Our Turky company have a con&s;ul at Cairo for the protection of their trade; which, be&s;ides the product of the country, con&s;i&s;ts chiefly in cof|fee, frankin&s;ence, gums, drugs, and other mer|chandize, brought from Arabia, and the Ea&s;tern countries, which they export to Europe: but the ballance on the whole of the Levant trade is &s;aid to be greatly again&s;t us, or at lea&s;t much le&s;s in our fa|vour
<PB N="88" REF="870">
than it u&s;ed to be, the French having &s;up|planted us in a great mea&s;ure. One of the princi|pal manufactures of Egypt is &s;al-ammoniac, of the preparation of which we &s;hall give an account af|terwards.</P>
<P>We now proceed to a more particular de&s;crip|tion of the three grand divi&s;ions mentioned above, namely, Lower, Middle, and Upper Egypt.</P>
<P>Lower Egypt, or Egypt properly &s;o called, has the epithet of Power on account of its &s;ituation, in re&s;pect of the cour&s;e of the Nile, it being the la&s;t of the three through which that river runs, and from which it di&s;charges it&s;elf into the &s;ea. It is bounded on the &s;outh by Middle Egypt; on the north by the &s;ea; on the we&s;t by the de&s;ert of Bar|ca; and on the ea&s;t by the i&s;thmus of Suez. This country is very fertile, and &s;o well improved, that it abounds with pa&s;ture grounds, corn wine, rice, dates, &s;enna, ca&s;&s;ia, balm, medicinal drugs, plants, and &s;ome other valuable articles. The places of mo&s;t note in this divi&s;ion are,</P>
<P>Alexandria, by the Turks called Scanderic, once the capitan of all Egypt, and a very celebrated city. It is well known that this city took its name from Alexander the Great, who coming to Rha|cetis, after con&s;ulting the oracle of Jupiter Am|mon, and being plea&s;ed with the &s;ituation of the place, ordered a new city to be built there. After the death of Alexander, the Ptolemies cho&s;e this city for the place of their re&s;icence by which it became the metropolis of Egypt. On the &s;hore, where the antient palace of the Ptolemies &s;tood, are &s;till to be &s;een great remains of &s;tately build|ings, with &s;everal pieces of porphyry, and other fine marbles. It is &s;ituated at the mouth of the Canopean branch of the Nile, where it forms a no|ble &s;pacious haven or bay, in the form of a cre&s;|cent,
<PB N="89" REF="880">
and which, though not very &s;afe, is much frequented. In this bay, about nine hundred paces from the &s;hore, lies the i&s;land of Pharos, extending from ea&s;t to we&s;t, and forming two ports, one to the we&s;t, formerly called Funo&s;tus, and now the Old port; and another to the ea&s;t, formerly called the Great port. and now the New. The &s;ea has gained &s;omewhat on the we&s;t end of the i&s;land. The famous light-hou&s;e, named Pharos, from the i&s;land, &s;tood on a rock at the ea&s;t end of it, which was &s;urrounded on all &s;ides with water, &s;o as to form a &s;mall &s;eparate i&s;land. Very few antient re|mains, be&s;ides what we mentioned above, with a part of the walls, and Pompey's Pillar, are now to be &s;een here, having been either carried away to other places, or employed in building the pre&s;ent city. After the building of Alexandria, a great part of the trade from India came this way parti|cularly what was carried on in the Per&s;ian Gulph, and on the coa&s;t of Malabar; for goods from thence, after having been brought up the Red Sea, and landed at Elam, now Suez, were conveyed from thence over land to the Nile, and then by water to Alexandria It is now little more than the &s;kele|ton of what it has been; but has &s;till &s;ome trade, and is pretty populous. The di&s;covery of the way to the Ea&s;t-Indies, by the Cape of Good-Hope, gave a great blow to the trade and gran|deur of this city, as well as to that of Grand Cario, Ro&s;etto, and Damietta. Pompey's Pillar, mention|ed above, the fine&s;t piece of antiquity &s;till re|maining, &s;tands about two hundred paces from the town: it was erected by Julius Cae&s;ar, in me|mory of his victory over that great man, who fled hither from the battle of Phar&s;alia, and was mur|dered on the Egyptian coa&s;t. The body of the pillar is one entire piece of granate marble, or &s;ome compo&s;ition as durable and beautiful as marble.
<PB N="90" REF="890">
The height of it is &s;eventy feet, and the circum|ference twenty-five, with a noble capital and ba&s;e, on which are &s;everal hieroglyphics.</P>
<P>The Nile formerly di&s;charged it&s;elf into the &s;ea by &s;everal mouths, be&s;ides two p&s;eudo &s;tomota, or fal&s;e mouths, as they were called, which were too &s;mall to carry larger ve&s;&s;els: but mo&s;t of the&s;e mouths have been &s;ince &s;topped up, and others formed; &s;o that there are now reckoned to be above thirty channels, which carry the waters of the Nile into the &s;ea, e&s;pecially at its overflowing, the greater part of them becoming dry when the waters retire; the two chief, and indeed the only con&s;iderable arms at pre&s;ent, being that of Ro&s;etta, or Ra&s;hid, to the we&s;t, and that of Damietta, or Dimy&acirc;t, to the ea&s;t.</P>
<P>Ro&s;etto or Ro&s;etta, called by the Arabs Ra&s;h&icirc;d, a healthy, plea&s;ant, and populous city, giving name, as we ob&s;erved ju&s;t now, to one of the chief channels of the Nile. The chief bu&s;ine&s;s of the inhabitants is carrying the European merchan|dizes, which are brought hither from Alexandria to Cairo in boats. For this purpo&s;e they have vice|con&s;uls and factors to expedite bu&s;ine&s;s, and all let|ters and bills brought from Alexandria. Letters of con&s;equence are conveyed by land acro&s;s the de|&s;ert, by foot me&s;&s;engers, directly to Cairo. Near the city grows a great deal of the lotus.</P>
<P>Damietta, the antient Pelu&s;ium, &s;tanding on the other chief channel of the Nile, namely, that to the ea&s;t, about an hundred miles from Ro&s;etto, and about ten from the mouth of the channel. Though ill-built, it is large, antient, and populous, contain|ing, exclu&s;ive of &s;trangers, and a &s;uburb on the other &s;ide of the river, inhabited by &s;ailors and fi&s;h|ermen, about twenty-five thou&s;and inhabitants.</P>
<P>Benalha&s;&s;ar, a village on the mo&s;t ea&s;terly branch of the Nile, where the antient city of Buba&s;tus is
<PB N="91" REF="900">
&s;uppo&s;ed to have &s;tood, and where great ruins are &s;till to be &s;een.</P>
<P>Aboa&s;ar, a village not far from the former, where the antient city Bu&s;iris is &s;aid to have &s;tood.</P>
<P>The towns and villages between Damietta and Cairo, or Al-Kahira, lie pretty thick; and a good number of the inhabitants are employed, &s;ome in hatching va&s;t multitudes of eggs in ovens, and rearing the chickens, and others in making great quantities of &s;al-ammoniac. This &s;alt is procured from the &s;oot which ari&s;es from the burnt dung of animals that feed only on vege|tables; but the dung of the&s;e animals is only fit to be burnt for that purpo&s;e during the four fir&s;t months of the year, when they feed on fre&s;h &s;pring gra&s;s, which in Egypt is a kind of trefoil or clover; for when they feed only on dry meat it will not do. The dung of oxen, buffaloes, &s;heep, goats, hor&s;es, and apes, at the proper time, is as fit as the dung of camels for this purpo&s;e. It is &s;aid, that even human dung is equal to any other. The &s;oot ari&s;ing from the burnt dung is put into gla&s;s ve&s;|&s;els, and the&s;e ve&s;&s;els into an oven or kiln, which is heated by degrees, and at la&s;t with a very &s;trong fire, for three &s;ucce&s;&s;ive nights and days; after which, the &s;moke fir&s;t &s;hews it&s;elf, and, in a &s;hort time, the &s;alt appears, adhering to the gla&s;&s;es, and by degrees covers the whole opening. The gla&s;&s;es being broken, the &s;alt is taken out in the &s;ame &s;tate and form in which it is &s;ent to Europe.</P>
<P>The greate&s;t part of the Lower Egypt con&s;i&s;ts of that tract which is encompa&s;&s;ed by the arms of the Nile, and called, from its triangular figure, the Delta. This tract, which is now the mo&s;t fertile and populous in Egypt, it is &s;aid, was nothing but a &s;tanding pool, till the patriarch Jo&s;eph, by drain|ing it of the water, and clearing it of the ru&s;hes and mar&s;hy weeds, rendered it fit for tillage. However,
<PB N="92" REF="910">
there are &s;till &s;everal lakes in it, be&s;ides tho&s;e that are in other parts of Egypt, affording great numbers of fi&s;h, though not or above &s;even or eight &s;orts; two or which they &s;alt, and &s;end large quantities to Syria, Cyprus, and Con&s;tantinople. The reve|nue which one of the&s;e lakes alone, called Manza|lah, brings into the Grand Signior's trea&s;ury, amounts to no le&s;s than forty thou&s;and crowns a-year. Tho&s;e who live near the&s;e lakes have great plenty of fre&s;h fi&s;h, as the I&s;raelites formerly had. Some Arabs divide the Deita into two parts, Al-Rif, and Al-Bahriya; the former of which, being the we&s;tern part, is &s;uppo&s;ed by Bochart to be the Rachad of Scripture. In the Delta formerly, be&s;ides a great number of other celebrated cities, &s;tood Tanis, &s;uppo&s;ed to be the Zoar of Scripture, which Mo&s;es &s;ays was built before Heb$on in Paie&s;line. He|liopolis, or the City of the Sun, and commonly thought to be the On of Scripture, &s;tood with|out the Delta, about three miles from the river, towards the ea&s;t.</P>
<P>Middle Egypt is &s;ituated between the Upper and Lower, having the former on the &s;outh, and the lat|ter on the north, the Red Sea on the ea&s;t, and the De&s;ert of Barca on the we&s;t. Antiently it was chiefly known by the name of Heptanomis, from the &s;even nomes, or prefectures, into which it was divided; but, at pre&s;ent, by tho&s;e of Bakeirah, and Bene&s;or. It is parted into two by the Nile, on the banks of which the &s;oil is fruitful; but &s;andy and barren the farther it is removed from that river. The places of mo&s;t note in it are,</P>
<P>Cairo, or Al Kahirah, the capital of all Egypt, and a very large and populous city, plea&s;antly &s;ituated on the Nile. It appears to have been for|merly a place of extraordinary commerce, from the va&s;t number of its &s;quares, caravan&s;eras, bazars, and other public buildings, now decayed, &s;ince the trade
<PB REF="920">
to the Ea&s;t-Indies hath been carried on by the way of the Cape of Good Hope; yet it is &s;till famed for &s;ome manufactures, e&s;pecially that of Turky carpets, and has a good trade by means of the ca|ravans. It was founded in the year of the Hejra, or Hejira, 358, and the month of Ramadan, by Jawhar Al-Kayed, a Greek renegado and &s;lave, omrah or general to Al Moezz Ledini'llah, the caliph of Mohdia or Mahdia, a part of Africa, &s;o called by the Saracens from the city Mahadi. The name of Kahirah, or Al-Kahirah, given it by its founder, &s;ignifies the Victorious. The Turki&s;h beglerbeg, or viceroy of the whole kingdom, re|&s;ides here in the ca&s;tle, which &s;tands on the top of a hill in the &s;outh quarter of the city, and commands a noble pro&s;pect of it and its environs. It is two or three miles in circumference, and looks like another city. There is a well in it two hundred and eighty feet deep, called Jo&s;eph's well, which, with another at Matarea, about five miles north-ea&s;t of Cairo, are &s;aid to be the only ones that yield good water in the whole kingdom. At the la&s;t of the&s;e, it is reported, that the Virgin Mary, and her hu&s;band Jo&s;eph, re&s;ted, when they fled with our Saviour from Herod; and that, being very thir&s;ty, a &s;pring i&s;&s;ued &s;uddenly out of the earth for their relief. In the ruins of a noble building, which is pretended to be Jo&s;eph's hall, where he &s;at in judg|ment, are &s;hewn thirty fine pillars of Theban mar|ble, with part of the roof, overlaid with gold and azure. Cairo is &s;aid to contain more than two millions of people. A caravan, con&s;i&s;ting of thirty or forty thou&s;and pilgrims, &s;ets out from hence year|ly for Mecca.</P>
<P>Old Cairo lies on the ea&s;t &s;ide of the river, and is &s;uppo&s;ed to have been the antient Egyptian Ba|bylon. Mr. Salmon, in his geography, mentions a holy cheat performed in a burying-place near it,

<P>Suez, a &s;mall city, from which the i&s;thmus that joins Africa with A&s;ia hath its name. It &s;tands about thirty hours ea&s;t from Cairo, by the road called Tauriche Beni I&s;rael, i. e. the Road of the Children of I&s;rael, at the bottom of the Heroo|politan Gulph, or we&s;tern branch of the Red Sea, and has about two hundred hou&s;es, and an old ca&s;tle. Here al&s;o is a &s;mall haven, but &s;o &s;hallow that &s;hips of any burden cannot get into it; howe|ver, there is a good road by it, where they can ride &s;afely, and at ea&s;e. The greate&s;t inconvenience of the place is, that it has no &s;weet water nearer than four or five miles. We are even told, that there are not above half a dozen wells betwixt Cairo and Mecca, at lea&s;t in the road the pilgrims go, which lies to the northward of this, and even the&s;e are bitteri&s;h and bracki&s;h. Suez was formerly a place
<PB N="95" REF="940">
of great trade, but &s;ince the way to the Ea&s;t-Indies by the Cape of Good Hope hath been di&s;covered it hath been upon the decline. The place on the we&s;t coa&s;t of the gulph, where the Children of I&s;|rael are &s;uppo&s;ed to have entered it, is called Ba|deah, about &s;ix miles to the north of Cape Koron|del, on the other &s;ide of the gulph, as we are informed in the above-mentioned letter from the ingenious Edward Wortley Montague, F. R. S. to Dr. Wat&s;on, containing an account of his journey from Cairo to the Written Mountains, in the De&s;ert of Sinai. Oppo&s;ite to Badeah is a &s;trong current, which &s;ets to the oppo&s;ite &s;hore, about &s;outh-ea&s;t, with a whirlpool called Birque Pharaone, the Well or Pool of Pharaoh, being the place where his ho&s;t is &s;aid to have been de|&s;troyed. We are told by the &s;ame gentleman, that the Egyptian &s;hore, from Suez to Badeah, is &s;o rocky and &s;teep, that there was no entering upon the gulph but at one of the&s;e two places; that it is high water in the gulph always when the moon is at her meridian height; that at Suez it flows &s;ix feet; that the &s;pring tides are nine feet, and in the variable months, from the beginning of November to the end of April, &s;ometimes twelve; that, from the beginning of May to the beginning of Octo|ber, a northerly wind generally ri&s;es, and goes down with the &s;un, which is often very &s;trong; that this wind never fails in the&s;e months, unle&s;s there be &s;ome violent &s;torm; that the re&s;t of the year the winds are variable, and, when they blow|hard at &s;outh and &s;outh-&s;outh-ea&s;t, &s;et up the &s;ea through the narrow Strait of Babel-Mandel, and up this we&s;tern branch or gulph, through its mouth, between Gebel El-Zait on the we&s;t, and the &s;outh|ern mo&s;t point of the Bay of Tor on the ea&s;t, where it is not above twelve or fourteen miles over. This wind, it is probable, hindering the water from going out, is the occa&s;ion of the extraordinary
<PB N="96" REF="950">
increa&s;e in the &s;pring-tides. The &s;ame thing hap|pens with the &s;ame winds at Venice, both gulphs running nearly in the &s;ame direction. The Egyp|tian, We&s;tern, or Thebaic Shore, from Badeah &s;outhward, to oppo&s;ite Tor on the ea&s;tern &s;hore, is all mountainous and &s;teep; and at Elim, the northernmo&s;t point of the bay of Tor, ends the ridge of mountains which begin on the ea&s;tern &s;hore of this we&s;tern branch at Karondel.</P>
<P>Mr. Montague tells us, that there are admirable fore&s;ts of marine productions, particularly madrepo|res, in the Heroopolitic or we&s;tern branch; but not in the Elantic or ea&s;tern branch of the gulph, at lea&s;t on the broad part of it below Cape Maho|met. The name of Red Sea, however, &s;eems to regard this part alone; for tho' the abovementioned &s;ea productions are not found there, yet there is &s;o great a quantity of the tube coral of a deep red, (not found in the we&s;tern branch) and &s;uch rocks of it, as one may call them, that the Gedda &s;hips fa&s;ten them&s;elves to them, in&s;tead of ca&s;ting anchor. The Red Sea is tempe&s;tuous and full of &s;hoals. There is no harbour on the Arabian &s;ide except Tor, between Suez and Gedda, which is a day and a half from Mecca; nor is there any on the oppo&s;ite coa&s;t be&s;ides Co&s;&s;ire, which is a very bad one: however, &s;hips &s;ometimes go thither, and caravans cro&s;s the country to Mar&s;hout. The &s;hips u&s;ed in the Red Sea have the helm on the out|&s;ide, as it is &s;uppo&s;ed that in which St. Paul was pa&s;|&s;enger had. They have only four &s;ails, and no com|pa&s;s, nor do they ever ca&s;t the lead. They &s;ail only by day light, and from anchoring-place to anchoring|place, and are not above two days out of &s;ight of land from Cape Mahomet to the Arabian Main: if a gale happen, they are often lo&s;t; about one in ten every year. The antient city Heroopolis, from which the we&s;tern branch or gulph takes its name, is &s;uppo&s;ed to have been &s;ituated near the

<HEAD>The HIGHER or UPPER EGYPT.</HEAD>
<P>The province of the Higher or Upper Egypt, by the Greeks antiently called Thebais, from its capital Thebes, and in &s;cripture Pathros, is bound|ed on the ea&s;t &s;ide by the Red Sea, all the way; on the north by the Middle Egypt; on the we&s;t by the de&s;ert of Barca; and on the &s;outh by Nu|bia, and the coa&s;t of Abex. At pre&s;ent it is by far the lea&s;t cultivated and populous of the three, but &s;eems to have been far otherwi&s;e formerly; for there are amazing remains of antiquity in it, con|&s;i&s;ting of magnificent marble pillars, obeli&s;ks, &amp;c. and tho&s;e fine marble pillars and obeli&s;ks at Rome, are &s;aid to have been hewed out of the rocks in Upper Egypt. The chief of the modern places are,</P>
<P>Sayd, antiently Thebes, Hecatompylos, and Di|o&s;polis, the capital of Upper Egypt, and one of the fine&s;t cities in the world, but now incon&s;ider|able. Here, as at many other places in this divi&s;ion, are va&s;t columns of marble and porphyry, which lie half buried in the ground, and &s;tatues and obe|li&s;ks of a prodigious &s;ize, with hieroglyphics on them. At a place called Beban-el-Meluke, i. e. the gate or court of the kings, not far from hence, are to be &s;een the &s;epulchres of the kings of Thebes, lying in grottos, cut out of the rock in a mo&s;t beautiful manner, with long rooms or galleries under the mountains.

<HEAD>ETHIOPIA, comprehending Nubia, Aby&s;|&s;ina, Abe&s;h or Abex, and Anian.</HEAD>
<P>The name of Ethiopia was given by the antients to all they knew of Africa to the &s;outh of Egypt, and that of Ethiopes to its inhabitants, from their &s;warthy or black complexions.</P>
<P>Ethiopia is bounded to the north by Egypt and the de&s;ert of Barca; to the &s;outh by Zan|guebar and Caffraria; to the ea&s;t by the Red Sea and the Ea&s;tern Ocean; and to the we&s;t by Guinea, Nigritia, and Zaara.</P>
<P>Nubia, which con&s;titutes the fir&s;t divi&s;ion of it, mentioned above, is bounded towards the north by Egypt; on the &s;outh by Aby&s;&s;inia; on the ea&s;t by the coa&s;t of Abe&s;h or Abex; and to the we&s;t by Zaara and Nigritia. It is &s;aid to be four hundred leagues in length, and two hundred in breadth; but the&s;e dimen&s;ions cannot be de|pended on, little being certainly known by our be&s;t hi&s;torians or geographers, with re&s;pect to this and the other inland countries of Africa.</P>
<P>This country, we are told, is watered by a river that falls into the Nile, and abounds in gold, mu&s;k, &s;andal-wood, ivory, elephants, hor&s;es, camels, lions, and &s;uch other animals as are found in the neighbouring country of Aby&s;&s;inia; but they give us not the lea&s;t information with re&s;pect to its con|&s;titution and government, tho' it is probable, it is
<PB N="100" REF="990">
divided into a number of petty kingdoms and &s;tates, becau&s;e we hear &s;o little of the inhabitants. The &s;ame uncertainty we meet with in regard to their religion; but it is probable Pagani&s;m, Ju|dai&s;m, Chri&s;tianity, and Mahommedi&s;m, have their &s;everal votaries here, as they all have in &s;ome or other of the countries that &s;urround them.</P>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>ABYSSINIA.</HEAD>
<P>Aby&s;&s;inia has now little communication with the re&s;t of the world, the Turks having po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed them|&s;elves of Abex, which runs along the we&s;tern coa&s;t of the Red Sea, and the re&s;t of it being &s;ur|rounded with mountains. Within the&s;e it appears to be an exceeding fine country, diver&s;ified with woods and fruitful plains, well planted with palm|trees, dates, and cedars, and watered with &s;everal noble rivers, particularly the Nile, which runs thro' the mid&s;t of it, and having fir&s;t taken a circuit al|mo&s;t round its &s;ource, runs a hundred miles to the northward, and afterwards two hundred miles towards the ea&s;t; then turning to the &s;outh and &s;outh-ea&s;t, continues its cour&s;e two hundred and fifty miles farther. In this cour&s;e it forms the lake Dambea, a hundred and twenty miles in cir|cuit. From thence it takes a &s;emicircular &s;weep of five hundred miles, and then turning directly north, enters the kingdom of Egypt. This wind|ing cour&s;e not only &s;preads fertility all over the country, but is of great &s;ervice to inland com|merce; tho' after the Nile enters Egypt, there are &s;o many &s;teep falls and cataracts, that the river is no longer properly navigable for the purpo&s;es of traffic. Being &s;welled by the rains, which annually fall at a certain &s;ea&s;on between the tropics, it overflows all the lower grounds that border on it; and this is the ca&s;e of all the rivers within the tropics, tho' the antients knew it not, and for that rea&s;on were &s;o much at a lo&s;s to account for the periodical in|undations
<PB N="101" REF="1000">
of the Nile in Egypt. Tho' the moun|tains of Aby&s;&s;inia &s;end down prodigious torrents during the periodical rains, when the &s;un is verti|cal, yet the inhabitants reap this among other ad|vantages from them, that they furni&s;h them with cool retreats, during the exce&s;&s;ive heats of &s;um|mer. As for the vallies, being rendered fruitful by the annual rains, they produce plenty of corn, rice, millet, dates, grapes, flax, cotton, &s;ugar, and fruits proper for the climate. Their flax is e&s;teemed the fine&s;t in the world; and from hence it is &s;aid the Egyptians had theirs, of which they made the fine lin|en of Egypt, mentioned in Scripture: and had they, at this day, an opportunity of exporting the pro|duce of their &s;oil, this di&s;trict alone, it is thought, might rai&s;e rice, &s;ugar, and other commodities, &s;ufficient to &s;erve all the neighbouring countries. The Turks, who are ma&s;ters of the coa&s;t of the Red Sea, tho' they will &s;uffer no other nation to trade to Aby&s;&s;inia, annually export great quantities of rice from hence, particularly at the time of the great pilgrimages to Mecca, Arabia not affording pro|vi&s;ion &s;ufficient for their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. Gold al&s;o is very plentiful here, of which the Turks get &s;ome; and had the Ethiopians an opportunity of bartering it for the merchandize of Europe, it is thought we might meet with as great plenty of it here as any where, tho' none of the gold mines are wrought at pre&s;ent, but only tho&s;e of &s;ilver and copper. Among other precious &s;tones, they have the large&s;t emeralds in the world.</P>
<P>Their cattle are camels, dromedaries, elephants, oxen, &s;heep, mules, a&s;&s;es, all in great plenty, and very large; their wild bea&s;ts are &s;uch as are com|mon to the re&s;t of Africa; but what they are mo&s;t famous for is, an excellent breed of hor&s;es, equal to tho&s;e of Arabia; or, as &s;ome conjecture, tho&s;e of Arabia are in reality bred in Aby&s;&s;inia, where they abound in rich pa&s;tures. The zebra al&s;o, or
<PB N="102" REF="1010">
wild a&s;s, &s;uch as that which &s;ome years ago was pre&s;ented to our queen, and &s;o much admired for its beauty, is &s;aid to be among the animals of this country, and another called by the inhabitants giratacachem, or &s;lender tail, &s;uppo&s;ed to be the &s;truthio camelus, or camelopardus, or panther ca|mel mentioned by the antients. The lake Dambea is &s;aid to breed great numbers of &s;ea-hor&s;es, which come &s;ometimes to land, and do a deal of mi&s;chief. They are often infe&s;ted with prodigious flights of locu&s;ts, or gra&s;hoppers, in this country, which cover the &s;urface of the earth, and in a very &s;hort time devour every blade of gra&s;s to the very root. They are large and good to eat, and probably &s;uch as John the Bapti&s;t made u&s;e of for that purpo&s;e in the wilderne&s;s of Judea. Some even imagine, that they are the &s;helaw, which we tran&s;late quails, brought to the I&s;raelites in the de&s;erts of Sinai. In this country are al&s;o a great number of flying and other &s;erpents, particularly one &s;ort, which is &s;o much of the colour of the du&s;t or &s;and in which it lurks, and on which it feeds, that it is not ea&s;ily avoided, tho' its &s;ting is attended with immediate death, of the mo&s;t painful and dreadful kind, both to man and bea&s;t. The winds are &s;ometimes very terrible here, and do a great deal of mi&s;chief, as well as the rains, thunders, and lightnings.</P>
<P>The Aby&s;&s;inians are of a deep black complexion, but of a good &s;tature, and their features regular; they are not at all like the negroes of Guinea and the &s;outh of Africa, who have generally flat no&s;es, thick lips, and very &s;hocking countenances, in the opinion of the white people. The olive among the Aby&s;&s;inians is reckoned the fine&s;t complexion, and next to that the jet black. The better &s;ort of them are clothed in ve&s;ts made of &s;ilks, &s;tuffs, or cotton, after the manner of the Franks in Turky; but their poor people go almo&s;t naked, having
<PB N="103" REF="1020">
only a &s;mall piece of &s;kin or coar&s;e &s;tuff, wrapped about their wai&s;ts. They are &s;aid to have a great deal of vivacity and natural wit; to be of a teach|able di&s;po&s;ition, and fond of learning, tho' they have but few opportunities of improving them|&s;elves. They have no other bread but cakes bak|ed on the hearth. They eat all manner of fle&s;h but &s;wine-fle&s;h, and &s;uch other meats as were pro|hibited to the Jews. They ab&s;tain al&s;o from things &s;trangled, and from blood, killing their meat and draining the blood from it, as the Jews do. Their great men are above feeding them&s;elves, but are fed by their &s;ervants with &s;poons. Their u&s;ual drink is mead, or metheglin, their country abound|ing in honey. They have al&s;o liquor made of wheat or rice. The women are delivered here without any help, having nothing to do but kneel down; but ea&s;y labours are not confined to the Aby&s;&s;inian women, being common to all in tho&s;e hot climates, except where their reclu&s;e and &s;eden|tary life makes them otherwi&s;e.</P>
<P>The &s;overeign of this country was once ab&s;o|lute; but the government now appears to be a republic, or rather a mixed monarchy, in which the prince's power is extremely limited by the great men, without whom the king can tran&s;act no|thing of any con&s;equence. As to the common people, it is not material, whether the power is lodged in the king or the grandees, for they are all &s;laves either to the one or the other. The king, by his own &s;ubjects, is &s;tiled negus or king; but oftener nega&s;cha, nega&s;cht, which in their language &s;ignifies king of kings, to di&s;tingui&s;h him from the princes and governors of provinces, who are &s;tiled al&s;o negus. This prince pretends to be de&s;cended by lineal &s;ucce&s;&s;ion from the great Solomon, king of the Jews, by Makedda, or as Jo&s;ephus calls her, Nizauce, queen of the &s;outh,
<PB N="104" REF="1030">
who paid him that grand vi&s;it, mentioned 2 <HI>Kings</HI> x. The king is mo&s;t of the year in the field, attend|ed by great bodies of hor&s;e and foot, while he makes a tour thro' &s;ome part of his dominions in much the &s;ame manner as the Great Mogul. It is &s;aid there are no fortre&s;&s;es or walled towns in the whole empire.</P>
<P>The religion of the Aby&s;&s;inians &s;eems to be a mixture of Chri&s;tianity and Judai&s;m; but they &s;eem to adhere more to the Greek Church, than the Latin, and greatly to re&s;emble the Copts of Egypt, both in their tenets and forms. They keep both the Jewi&s;h and Chri&s;tian &s;abbaths, cir|cumci&s;e not only the males, but the females the eighth day, and baptize them a fortnight after. They reject the doctrine of tran&s;ub&s;tantiation, pur|gatory, divine &s;ervice in an unknown tongue, au|ricular confe&s;&s;ion, the u&s;e of images in the church, celibacy of prie&s;ts, extreme unction, &amp;c. They have but two &s;acraments, viz. bapti&s;m and the euchari&s;t, and give the bread and cup both to clergy and laity. They have neither archbi&s;hops, bi&s;hops, nor any order &s;uperior to prie&s;ts, except their abbuna, or &s;uffragan to the patriarch of A|lexandria, and the &s;uperiors or abbots of the &s;e|veral &s;ocieties of monks, who have &s;ome authority over them. The&s;e monks do not live in cloi&s;ters, or convents, but every one in his own hut, form|ing a kind of village near &s;ome church, where they perform divine &s;ervice by turns: their inferior orders below the prie&s;t or pre&s;byter, are the &s;ub-pre&s;byter, deacon, and &s;ub-deacon. The monks never marry. Polygamy is prohibited by their laws, but generally practi&s;ed. The king has at lea&s;t a hundred wives and concubines, and every great man as many as he plea&s;es. They have no particular funeral &s;ervice, but the prie&s;ts read over &s;ome pa&s;&s;ages in the p&s;alms &s;uitable to the occa&s;ion.
<PB N="105" REF="1040">
The decea&s;ed is laid in the grave without a coffin, and his relations mourn &s;everal months in rags, and a neglected dre&s;s. They rend their cloaths upon re|ceiving ill news, and other melancholy occa&s;ions, as many of the antients did.</P>
<P>The eunuch, prime-mini&s;ter of queen Candace, who was converted to Chri&s;tianity, and bapti&s;ed by St. Philip, is &s;uppo&s;ed to have come from this country, and to have introduced Chri&s;tianity into it. Ethiopia was then a mighty empire, &s;ubject to one &s;overeign, who commanded the &s;ea-coa&s;t, as well as the inland country. When the Portu|gue&s;e mi&s;&s;ionaries re&s;orted to Ethiopia, towards the latter end of the 15th century, they brought over a great many of the Ethiopians to their religion, and per&s;uaded the emperor not only to acknowledge the pope's &s;upremacy, but to admit a patriarch among them, &s;ent thither from Rome. The go|vernment al&s;o con&s;ented to aboli&s;h their antient rites and ceremonies, and conform entirely to the ritual of the Latin church; but many of the nobi|lity, and governors of the provinces, with the greater part of the common people, having the greate&s;t abhorrence of the&s;e innovations, ro&s;e in arms again&s;t their emperor, which occa&s;ioned civil wars in Ethiopia, that la&s;ted upwards of a hundred years, wherein many thou&s;ands fell on both &s;ides. But tho' the court, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Je&s;uits, European engineers, and &s;ome Portugue&s;e troops, was generally victorious, yet the bulk of the peo|ple &s;till adhered to their antient religion; and &s;e|veral provinces revolted entirely from the em|peror. However, the Ethiopian emperors conti|nued &s;till to profe&s;s the tenets of the Latin church, and to &s;ubmit to the dictates of Rome; 'till at length the Je&s;uits, under pretence of maintaining the pope's eccle&s;ia&s;tical juri&s;diction, took upon them to direct mo&s;t &s;ecular affairs, treating the

prince rather as a viceroy to the pope, than &s;o|vereign of the country; and having erected and garri&s;oned &s;everal forts, were &s;ending for European forces to maintain their u&s;urped power, when the emperor, as well as the nobility, taking the alarm, agreed at once to aboli&s;h popery, and re&s;tore their antient religion. The Romi&s;h prie&s;ts were here|upon generally &s;acrificed to the fury of the peo|ple, their patriarch very narrowly e&s;caping out of the country with his life: and, when afterwards three Capuchins came to Squaquena on the Red Sea, from whence they &s;ent letters to the emperor of Ethiopia to obtain leave to come into his territories again, that prince reque&s;ted the Turki&s;h ba&s;&s;a, who commanded on the coa&s;t, to &s;uffer no Franks to come that way into his territories, and to &s;end him the heads of the&s;e Capuchins. In this the ba&s;&s;a not only gratified him, but &s;ent him their &s;kins flea'd off and &s;tuffed, that he might know them to be Franks by their colour, and prie&s;ts by their &s;haved crowns. Thus have the Romi&s;h mi&s;&s;ionaries procured them&s;elves to be bani&s;hed out of almo&s;t every country where they have planted their religion. They have indeed by their &s;kill in medicine and mathematics, and an artful addre&s;s, in&s;inuated them&s;elves into the courts of many great princes; but their ill-advi&s;ed advancing of the pope's &s;upremacy to an extravagant height, together with their endeavours to controul the go|vernment in civil as well as eccle&s;ia&s;tical affairs, has ever occa&s;ioned their expul&s;ion. Thus it was in Japan, where the emperor finding them en|croaching upon his civil authority, ordered every Chri&s;tian in his dominions to be ma&s;&s;acred, and that no Chri&s;tian &s;hould ever &s;et foot there a|gain. This al&s;o has put a &s;top to their progre&s;s in China, and occa&s;ioned very &s;evere per&s;ecutions of the Chri&s;tians there; and now we find the whole

order in a fair way of being entirely &s;uppre&s;&s;ed in Europe, having been already expelled from Portu|gal, France, Spain, Naples, and the dutchy of Par|ma. As the knights templars in the 14th century, by their in&s;olence, brought all the Chri&s;tian princes in Europe to concur in extirpating them, &s;o have the Je&s;uits by their re&s;tle&s;s ambition, and intermed|dling in &s;ecular affairs.</P>
<P>As to the trade and manufactures of the Aby&s;&s;i|nians, we are told, that they have the &s;ilks, &s;tuffs, ca|licoes, linen, and carpets, which they u&s;e for furni|ture or cloathing, from the Turks, by the way of the Red Sea; who take the gold and emeralds of Aby&s;&s;inia in return for their merchandize, with &s;ome fine hor&s;es. The brokers or merchants, be|tween the Turks and Aby&s;&s;inians, are Jews, Ara|bians, or Armenian Chri&s;tians; for few or none of the natives trade, or travel abroad. The Jews al&s;o are &s;aid to be the only weavers and &s;miths among&s;t them; and as for other handicrafts, &s;uch as carpenters, taylors, and &s;hoemakers, every man breeds up his children to the trade or profe&s;&s;ion that he u&s;es him&s;elf. There are particular families who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s it is to make trumpets, horns, &amp;c. and tho&s;e &s;everal trades, like the ca&s;ts or tribes in the Ea&s;t-Indies, live &s;eparately, and do not intermix with any other trade or tribe, either by marriage or otherwi&s;e. When the Portugue&s;e fir&s;t found the way to Aby&s;&s;inia, the &s;hores of the Red Sea were open; but now the Turks keep &s;uch a &s;trict guard there, that it is difficult for any other people to have acce&s;s to them.</P>
<P>All that we have to add concerning Aby&s;&s;inia is, that the &s;ons of the emperor &s;ucceed according to their &s;eniority, as do tho&s;e of the nobility who have e&s;tates in fee; but the re&s;t of the peo|ple have no inheritance of their lands, nor can di&s;po&s;e of their e&s;tates or effects but by the per|mi&s;&s;ion

The Per&s;ians give the former the title of pat &s;ha, the di&s;po&s;er of kingdoms, which is the highe&s;t title known in A&s;ia, and equal to that of emperor in Europe. But every one of the&s;e princes, at his ac|ce&s;&s;ion to the throne, a&s;&s;umes a particular title: one &s;tiles him&s;elf the pillar of faith; another, the Vir|gin's incen&s;e; and another, the beloved of God, &s;prung from the &s;tock of Judah, the &s;on of Da|vid, the &s;on of Solomon, &amp;c.

from 5&deg;. north to 28&deg;. &s;outh, and comprehending the countries of Magadoxa, Melinda, Mombaza, Quiloa, Mo&s;ambique, and Sofala. All the people upon this coa&s;t are either in alliance with, or &s;ubject to the Portugue&s;e.</P>
<P>Magadoxa is a barren country, affording &s;carce any merchandize, or cattle, unle&s;s a good breed of hor&s;es, which the natives, a mixture of Pagans, Mohammedans, and Chri&s;tians, &s;ell to the Portu|gue&s;e, who di&s;po&s;e of them again to the Arabs.</P>
<P>Melinda, tho' it lies near the equator, is exceed|ing plea&s;ant, fruitful, and healthful, being frequent|ly refre&s;hed with &s;howers, and fine &s;ea breezes. The city of the &s;ame name, and the capital of the Por|tugue&s;e dominions in this part of the world, is &s;ituated in two degrees and an half &s;outh latitude, on an i&s;land at the mouth of a river al&s;o of the &s;ame name. It is a large populous place, well built, and has a good harbour, commanded by a &s;trong citadel. It is &s;aid, the inhabitants of the city, and the little i&s;land on which it &s;tands, do not amount to le&s;s than two hundred thou&s;and &s;ouls, a great part of whom are Chri&s;tians. The public buildings, con&s;i&s;ting of &s;eventeen churches, nine religious hou&s;es, the governor's palace, the maga|zine, and town-hall, exceed any thing of the kind that is to be found in Africa. The warehou&s;es are &s;tocked with all &s;orts of European goods, with which the Portugue&s;e trade with the natives for gold, elephants teeth, &s;laves, o&s;trich feathers, wax, &s;enna, aloes, civet, ambergrea&s;e, and frankincen&s;e. The country produces al&s;o rice, millet, &s;ugar, and fruits; and the Portugue&s;e export great quantities of rice to their other &s;ettlements, be&s;ides what they u&s;e them&s;elves.</P>
<P>Mombaza, taking its name from its capital, lies to the &s;outh of Melinda, and is much of the &s;ame nature with re&s;pect to its &s;oil, produce, &amp;c.</P>
<P><PB N="110" REF="1090">
Quiloa lies to the &s;outh of Mombaza, and is &s;aid to enjoy a fruitful &s;oil, but an unwhole&s;ome air. A con&s;iderable part of the country con&s;i&s;ts of an i&s;land. The king, we are told, pays a tribute in gold to the Portugue&s;e, amounting to the value of an hundred thou&s;and cru&s;adoes per annum. Excel|lent &s;ugars are produced here; but the Portugue&s;e &s;eek not to improve them, on account of the un|healthfulne&s;s of the climate. Mo&s;t of the people of Quiloa are idolaters, and the re&s;t Mohammedans.</P>
<P>Mo&s;ambique lies &s;outh of Quiloa, taking its name from the chief town, which is &s;ituated on an i&s;land, at the mouth of a river of the &s;ame name, in 15&deg;. &s;outh latitude. The i&s;land is thirty miles in circumference, and very populous, though the air is &s;aid to be very hot, and the &s;oil in general dry, &s;andy, and barren; yet they have mo&s;t of the tro|pical fruits, with black cattle, hogs, and &s;heep. There is a kind of fowl here, both the feathers and fle&s;h of which are black, in&s;omuch that, when they are boiled, the broth looks like ink; and yet their fle&s;h is very delicate, and good food. The town of Mo&s;ambique is regularly fortified, and has a good harbour, defended by a citadel, with &s;everal churches and mona&s;teries. The Portugue&s;e &s;hip|ping, to and from India, touch here for refre&s;h|ments. As the i&s;land abounds in cattle, the Portu|gue&s;e &s;laughter and &s;alt up a great deal of beef, which they afterwards &s;end to the Bra&s;ils, or &s;ell to the European &s;hipping. They al&s;o barter Eu|ropean goods with the natives for gold, elephants teeth, and &s;laves. There is another town, called Mongale, &s;ituated al&s;o on an i&s;land, and garri&s;on|ed by the Portugue&s;e, being their chief magazine for European goods. The gold they receive from the natives is found near the &s;urface of the earth, or in the &s;ands of rivers; no gold mines, or at lea&s;t very few, being at pre&s;ent wrought in Africa.</P>
<P><PB N="111" REF="1100">
Sofala lies &s;outh of Mo&s;ambique. From the mouth of the river of the Holy Gho&s;t to Cape Co|rientes, the land is very level, barren, and de&s;ert; but from that cape to the mouth of the river Cu|mena, the country is both fruitful and populous. The coa&s;t is very low, and mariners di&s;cover their approach to it not &s;o much by their &s;ight as &s;mell, becau&s;e it abounds with fragrant flowers. The inhabitants a&s;&s;ert, that their gold mines yield a|bove two millions of metigets per annum, each amounting to about twelve &s;hillings &s;terling; that the &s;hips from Zedein and Mecca carry off above two millions a-year, in time of peace; and that the governor of Mo&s;ambique, who&s;e office la&s;ts but three years, has above three hundred thou&s;and crowns revenue, exclu&s;ive of the &s;oldiers pay and the king of Portugal's tribute. From hence Mo|quet concludes, that this is the Ophir whither Solomon &s;ent &s;hips, every three years, from Ezion|geber, to fetch gold; Eziongeber being thought by many to be the town now called Suez, at the bottom of the Heroopolitan gulph of the Red Sea. This conjecture is &s;upported by &s;everal edi|fices that &s;eem to have been built by foreigners: &s;ome think it is al&s;o confirmed by the authority of the Septuagint, in which Ophir is tran&s;lated by the word <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, Sopheira; and &s;ince liquids are of|ten put for one another, Sopheira does not differ much from Sofala: be&s;ides, Thomas Lopez, in his Indian voyage, relates, that the inhabitants of this country boa&s;t, that they have books which prove that, in the time of Solomon, the I&s;raelites made a voyage thither, every third year, to fetch gold. The inhabitants of Melinda, Mombaza, and Quiloa, come to this country in little boats, called zambues, with &s;tuffs of blue and white cottons, &s;ilk &s;tuffs, yellow and red ambergrea&s;e, which they exchange here for gold and ivory; and the natives &s;ell them again to the people of Monomotopa, who give
<PB N="112" REF="1110">
them gold in return, without weighing it. It is &s;aid, when the Sofale&s;e &s;ee &s;hips coming, they light up fires, to &s;ignify that they &s;hall be welcome. The capital city here, and the only one of note, is al&s;o called Sofala. It &s;tands on a river of the &s;ame name, about &s;ix leagues from the &s;ea-coa&s;t. The Portugue&s;e have been ma&s;ters of it ever &s;ince the year 1500, and have built a &s;trong fortre&s;s. Their chief trade con&s;i&s;ts in ambergrea&s;e, gold, &s;laves, and &s;ilk &s;tuffs. There are al&s;o &s;ome mines lying to the &s;outh of the town that are &s;aid to be worked. Sofola is a country of great extent, but little known to any Europeans except the Portugue&s;e, who appear to be wi&s;er in relation to the conduct of their trade in Africa than any other of the European potentates; for, not content with erecting a few forts and facto|ries, they have &s;ettled upon the continent in great numbers, and brought the natives to clothe them|&s;elves according to the European mode; which has created a very con&s;iderable and profitable com|merce to them.</P>

<P>The kingdom of Monoemugi has Zanguebar on the ea&s;t; Monomotopa on the &s;outh; Motam|ba and Makoka on the we&s;t; and Aby&s;&s;inia on the north, and partly, as it is &s;uppo&s;ed, on the we&s;t, though its boundaries that way cannot be exactly a&s;certained. It is of great extent, being di|vided into &s;everal le&s;&s;er kingdoms or principalities; as tho&s;e of Mujaco, Anzico, Gingiro, Cambate, Alaba, and Monoemugi Proper.</P>
<P>Mujaco borders ea&s;tward on Congo, and the in|habitants of the latter travel to the former for ele|phant's teeth.</P>
<P>In Anzico the people do not till the ground, nor have they any property or &s;ettled habitation, but, like
<PB N="113" REF="1120">
the Arabs, wander from place to place, and &s;ub&s;i&s;t by plunder. They traffic with the kingdom of Angola, exchanging &s;laves for &s;alt, gla&s;s beads, &s;ilk, knives, and other wares.</P>
<P>Gingiro is a very potent kingdom. The king's &s;tate is extraordinary great. It is &s;aid, that he ne|ver goes abroad, or gives audience, after &s;un-ri&s;ing, alledging, that two &s;uns ought not to appear at once; and when he buys any thing of foreign mer|chants, he pays them in &s;laves, which he takes at plea|&s;ure from any family, without contradiction; and yet, it &s;eems, his palace is no better than a cottage.</P>
<P>Cambate, we are told, pays &s;ome acknowledge|ments to the emperor of Aby&s;&s;inia, which, howe|ver, are only voluntary.</P>
<P>Alaba is a large kingdom, inhabited by a cruel people, called Galas. The prince is &s;aid to be a Mohammedan; but many of his &s;ubjects are idola|ters of the wor&s;t &s;ort, offering human &s;acrifices to their idols, and &s;paring none that dare travel through their country.</P>
<P>Monoemugi Proper abounds with gold, &s;ilver, copper mines, and elephants. The natives clothe them&s;elves in &s;ilks and cottons, which they buy of &s;trangers, and wear collars of tran&s;parent amber beads, brought them from Cambaya, which &s;erve al&s;o for money; gold and &s;ilver being too com|mon, and of little value among them. The mo|narch always endeavours to be at peace with the princes round about him, to keep open the trade with Melinda, Mombaza, and Quiloa, on the ea&s;t, and with Congo on the we&s;t, from all which the black merchants re&s;ort hither for gold. This country affords al&s;o abundance of palm-wine, and oil, and &s;uch great plenty of honey, that above one half of it is lo&s;t, the blacks not being able to con&s;ume it. The air is generally very unwhole|&s;ome, and exce&s;&s;ively hot, which is the rea&s;on that no Europeans venture to travel into this country:

The air of this country is &s;aid to be very temperate, and the &s;oil fertile, being wa|tered by &s;everal rivers, on the banks of which grow many fine trees and &s;ugar-canes, without any culture. The inhabitants are rich in black cattle, which they value more than gold; but have no bea&s;ts of burden, excepting elephants, of which they have abundance, as appears from the great quantity of ivory brought from hence. Here are many gold mines, and the rivers that run through their veins carry a great deal of gold-du&s;t along with their &s;treams. The emperor of Monomo|topa drinks nothing but mead, or palm-wine, per|fumed with mu&s;k and amber. None but perfumed flambeaux are burnt before him. He never &s;tirs out of his palace, but they kill a bea&s;t, and, whil&s;t he &s;teps over it, his courtiers make loud acclama|tions, and ob&s;erve the motions of the entrails of the victim, that the prie&s;ts may better tell his ma|je&s;ty's fortune. He commonly wears by his &s;ide a hedging-bill with an ivory handle, and two arrows in his hands. He has above a thou&s;and wives; but one only is queen, and her elde&s;t &s;on heir to the crown. The inhabitants, we are told, go na|ked, from the wai&s;t upwards; but about their wai&s;ts they wear a piece of coloured cloth, and put their privities into a gourd bottle, e&s;pecially when they go abroad, and are afraid of being &s;tung by
<PB N="115" REF="1140">
&s;ome venemous in&s;ects. Per&s;ons of quality wear over their other garments hides, with long tails hanging down to the ground. White is the mourn|ing of this country. No man appears before the emperor, or the great men with whom he has any bu&s;ine&s;s, without a pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>The arms of the inhabitants are a bow and ar|row, darts, poignards, cutla&s;&s;es, and &s;abres. We are told, there is a warlike &s;ort of women here, who, like the antient Amazons, cut off their left brea&s;ts, that they may &s;hoot their arrows with more freedom. They carry the &s;ame arms as the men, and &s;hoot backward, while they pretend to be retiring, like the Parthians of old; but, when their pur&s;uers are near, they face about upon them, and kill all that oppo&s;e them. It is &s;aid, the Monomotopans have a barba|rous cu&s;tom of cutting off the privy members of the pri&s;oners they take in war, and making chains of them for their wives. When, upon a trial, it ap|pears doubtful whether the per&s;on charged is guil|ty or not, they make u&s;e of a liquor, which if any one drinks without harm, he is accounted inno|cent; but if he vomits, they reckon him guilty.</P>
<P>Monomotopa is divided into &s;even provinces or petty kingdoms, va&s;&s;als to the emperor. Manica, &s;ituated to the &s;outh of the river del Spiritu Santo, is the capital town.</P>

Its greate&s;t breadth, from Cape St. Tome to the mouth of the above-mentioned river, is about nine hundred miles; but from the tropic of Cancer up to the equinoctial line, being pent in, its breadth is not much above &s;ix hundred miles. It has Congo or Lower-Guinea, with the kingdom of Binguela, on the north-we&s;t; Monomotopa on the north-ea&s;t, from which it is &s;eparated by the river del Spiritu Santo; and on the north, where it extends almo&s;t to the equator, Monoemugi. On the other &s;ides, it is bounded by the Indian and At|lantic Oceans. Martiniere ob&s;erves, that Caffraria is not properly the name of any particular country; and that there is no nation called Caffres, that be|ing an opprobious appellation given by the Arabs to all tho&s;e who are not of the Mohammedan reli|gion. It is derived from the Arabic word Cafir, which &s;ignifies an infidel or unbeliever. The Por|tugue&s;e, taking the name in a more general &s;en&s;e, call all tho&s;e nations of Africa Caffres who have, or or &s;eem to have, no knowledge of a deity.</P>

<P>The air of this country would be exce&s;&s;ive hot, e&s;pecially in the vallies, if it was not for the va&s;t Southern Ocean, from which the wind blows al|mo&s;t on every &s;ide; and they are &s;carce ever free from &s;torms a week, which rai&s;e the waves of this exten&s;ive ocean to &s;o va&s;t a height, that they are, in a literal &s;en&s;e, frequently mountains high, &s;uch as we never &s;ee in this part of the world. But, though the&s;e &s;torms are trouble&s;ome, they make the country very healthful. If they happen to have a calm of any duration, all the people are troubled with the head-ach; but many rich &s;hips have been ca&s;t away by the&s;e &s;torms upon the coa&s;t, where there are hardly any harbours. The Dutch at the Cape &s;ometimes lo&s;e whole fleets, as they lie at anchor before the town, and they are forced to moor their guard&s;hip with &s;trong chains, in&s;tead of cables.</P>
<P>Caffraria is a mountainous country, but the &s;oil, at lea&s;t about the Cape of Good Hope, is exceed|ing fruitful. Of the mountains, there are three near the Cape, very high; viz. the Table Moun|tain, the Sugar-Loaf, and James Mountain, or the Lion's Rump. The top of the fir&s;t is always covered with a cap of clouds before a &s;torm: the &s;econd takes its name from its form.</P>

It does not appear that there are any navigable rivers here; but a great many brooks and rivulets de&s;cend from the mountains, and render the vallies exceeding fruitful: one of the&s;e, de&s;cending from the Table-Mountain, runs through the company's garden at the Cape. A great part of the inland country is &s;aid to be over-run with woods and fore&s;ts.</P>
<P>Among the wild bea&s;ts in Caffraria are lions, tigers, leopards, elephants, rhinocero&s;es, elks, ze|bras, and porcupines. There is al&s;o an animal, called by the Dutch a &s;ea-cow; but it always feeds on gra&s;s a&s;hore, according to Kolben, and only runs to the &s;ea for its &s;ecurity. The head re|&s;embles that of a hor&s;e more than a cow, and it &s;eems to be the &s;ame with the Egyptian hippopo|tamos.</P>
<P>Another animal, called by the Dutch the &s;tink|bing&s;ern, &s;eems to be peculiar to the Hottentot country, and to have obtained its name from the &s;tinking &s;cents it emits from its po&s;teriors, which are &s;uch that neither man nor bea&s;t can bear them. This is the creature's be&s;t defence when it is pur|&s;ued: the very dogs will de&s;ert the chace, rub their no&s;es, and howl, when the bea&s;t evacuates; and a man is perfectly &s;tifled with the nau&s;eous &s;tench.</P>
<P>The &s;hin-bones of the lion, it is &s;aid, are as hard, and as &s;olid as flint, atter they are dried, and u&s;ed in the &s;ame manner to &s;trike fire with. When he falls upon a man or bea&s;t, he fir&s;t knocks them down with his paw, and deprives them of all &s;en|&s;ation, before he touches them with his teeth, roaring mo&s;t terribly at the time he gives the mortal blow.</P>
<P>The elephants of this part of Africa are very large, their teeth weigh from &s;ixty to one hun|dred and twenty pounds, and their &s;trength is &s;carce to be conceived. One of them being yoked to a &s;hip, that was careening at the Cape,

fairly drew it along the &s;hore. They are from twelve to fifteen feet in height, and &s;ome &s;ay a great deal more; the female is much le&s;s than the male, and hath its brea&s;ts or dugs between its fore|legs: their u&s;ual food is gra&s;s, herbs, and roots, and the tender twigs of trees and &s;hrubs: they pull up every thing with their trunk, which &s;erves as a hand to feed them&s;elves with; they al&s;o &s;uck up water with it, and empty it into their mouths.</P>
<P>The rhinoceros is &s;omething le&s;s than the ele|phant, but of equal if not greater &s;trength; at lea&s;t the elephant runs away and avoids him, whenever he di&s;covers him. With his rough prickly tongue he licks the fle&s;h off the bones of an animal. The African rhinocero&s;es are &s;aid to have two horns, or horny &s;ub&s;tances, on their no&s;e or &s;nout.</P>
<P>The elk has a fine &s;lender neck, and a beautiful head, not much unlike that of a deer.</P>
<P>European a&s;&s;es are common at the Cape; and as for the zebra, or wild a&s;s, many people in Eng|land have had an opportunity of &s;eeing that beau|ful one pre&s;ented &s;ome years ago to the queen.</P>
<P>The Dutch have repleni&s;hed their &s;ettlements at the Cape with European hogs, as well as tho&s;e of the Indian black breed, without bri&s;tles, who&s;e bellies almo&s;t touch the ground.</P>
<P>There is a &s;pecies of eagles here, called dung|birds, which, if they find an ox or cow laid down, will fall upon it in great numbers, and having made a hole in the belly of it with their bills and talons, will perfectly &s;coop out the in&s;ide of it, and leave nothing but a bare &s;keleton covered with the hide.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the natives of this country, cal|led Hottentots, they are of a middling &s;tature, and well made, &s;eldom either too fat or lean, and &s;carce ever crooked; they disfigure their children them|&s;elves, by flatting and breaking the gri&s;les of their
<PB N="120" REF="1190">
no&s;es, looking on a flat no&s;e as a beauty; their eye-brows are large, their eyes black, their lips thick, their hair like that of the negroes, &s;hort, black, and curled; and they have exceeding white teeth. They re&s;emble the negroes al&s;o pretty much in colour, after they have taken a great deal of pains with grea&s;e and &s;oot to darken their na|tural tawny complexions.</P>
<P>They be&s;mear their bodies with grea&s;e and &s;oot, perhaps to appear blacker, and often twi&s;t the guts of bea&s;ts and fowls about their legs and arms in the manner of bracelets, and &s;ome &s;ay they occa|&s;ionally make u&s;e of them for food. Upon their heads they wear &s;ome &s;hells, and on their bodies a mantle of &s;heep &s;kin with the woolly &s;ide out|wards in &s;ummer, and inwards in winter, and a|nother piece like an apron hanging before from the navel, generally of cat&s;kin, with the hairy &s;ide outwards. This garment &s;erves the man for his bed at night, and this is all the winding-&s;heet or coffin he has when he dies. If he be the captain of a village, or chief of his nation, in&s;tead of a &s;heep&s;kin, his mantle is made of tyger-&s;kins, wild cat&s;kins, or &s;ome other &s;kins they &s;et a value upon. The rea&s;on they alledge for be&s;mearing their bodies, and wearing grea&s;y &s;ooty caps on their heads, is to keep them cool.</P>
<P>The principal ornaments, both of men and wo|men, are gla&s;s or bra&s;s beads, with little thin plates of glittering bra&s;s, and mother of pearl, which they wear in their hair, or about their ears. Of the&s;e bra&s;s and gla&s;s-beads &s;trung, they al&s;o make necklaces, bracelets for the arms, and girdles, wearing &s;everal &s;trings of them about their necks, wai&s;ts, and arms. There is another ornament pe|culiar to the men, and that is the bladder of any wild bea&s;t they have killed, which is blown up and fa&s;tened to the hair, as a trophy of their valour.
<PB N="121" REF="1200">
Soon after their children are born, they lay them in the &s;un, or by the fire, and rub them over with fat or butter, mixed with &s;oot; and they continue to do &s;o almo&s;t every day them&s;elves after they are grown up.</P>
<P>Their huts are very mean, and &s;o is their fur|niture, con&s;i&s;ting only of two or three earthen pots to dre&s;s their victuals in, which are u&s;ually herbs, fle&s;h, &s;hell-fi&s;h, or milk. When they make but|ter, they put the milk into &s;ome &s;kin made in the form of a &s;oldier's knap&s;ack, the hairy-&s;ide in|wards; and then two of them taking hold of it, one at each end, they whirl and turn it round, 'till it is converted into butter, which they put up for anointing them&s;elves, and their caps and mantles, for they never eat any. Since the arrival of the Dutch among them, they are become very fond of tobacco, wine, brandy, and other &s;pirituous liquors.</P>
<P>Tho' the Hottentots are extremely lazy, indo|lent, and na&s;ty, yet they are generally healthy, and live to a great age; but this mu&s;t be under&s;tood of tho&s;e who keep to the diet of their country, and drink no wine, brandy, or other &s;trong li|quors: for &s;uch of them as drink the&s;e liquors &s;horten their days, and &s;uffer under di&s;ea&s;es before unknown. Even the victuals of the Dutch, dre&s;|&s;ed and &s;ea&s;oned after the European manner, are very pernicious to the Hottentots.</P>
<P>Both men and women always wear a little grea&s;y bag about their necks, in which they carry a knife, if they have one, with a pipe and &s;ome tobacco, or ducha, which is a &s;ort of wild hemp, which they eat and &s;moak, as they do tobacco. In this bag they al&s;o carry a piece of wood burnt at both ends, as an amulet again&s;t witchcraft. Many of the&s;e pouches are old gloves, which they have procured from the Europeans.</P>
<P><PB N="122" REF="1210">
The Hottentots are pretty good mechanics; they make their own &s;pears, darts, bows, and other weapons; they make al&s;o ivory rings, and brace|lets for their arms of elephants teeth; and every family make their own earthen ve&s;&s;els. Their traffic is very incon&s;iderable, having no money or medium of trade; they barter their cattle with the Dutch for wine, brandy, tobacco, and cutlery ware: but tho' they &s;ee the Dutch build good hou&s;es, plant vineyards, and cloath them&s;elves de|cently, it is ob&s;erved, that they &s;till adhere to their old cu&s;toms, and will not imitate the Dutch in any thing, not &s;o much as in planting grapes, tho' they are &s;o fond of wine and brandy, that one of them will turn a &s;pit for a Dutchman half a day for a draught of &s;our wine, or a dram of brandy.</P>
<P>The weapons of the Hottentots are javelins, darts, or &s;pears and arrows, which they poi&s;on, when at war. With the&s;e weapons they perform wonders of dexterity, both in the chace and in war. No people on earth, it is &s;aid, &s;hew &s;uch a quickne&s;s of eye, and &s;urene&s;s of hand in the u&s;e of them. If a Hottentot, in the chace of a hare, deer, or wild goat, comes but within thirty or for|ty yards of them, away flies the javelin, and down falls the creature, generally pierced quite thro' the body. When they take their aim at a mark, a bea&s;t, or a &s;ingle enemy, either with a dart or arrow, they &s;kip and dance from &s;ide to &s;ide, and brandi&s;h, and whirl it about in &s;uch a manner, that one would take their whole action for idle flouri&s;h, and not imagine they were aiming at any thing.</P>
<P>Every Hottentot nation has its king or chief, called konquer, who&s;e authority devolves upon him by hereditary &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. This chief has the power of making peace and war, and pre&s;ides in all their councils and courts of ju&s;tice; but then his authority is &s;aid to be limited, and that he can
<PB N="123" REF="1220">
determine nothing without the con&s;ent of the cap|tains of the &s;everal krails or villages, who &s;eem to be the Hottentot &s;enate. The captain of the krail, who&s;e office is hereditary al&s;o, is their leader in time of war, and chief magi&s;trate in time of peace; and, with the head of every family, determines all civil and criminal ca&s;es within the krail. Murder, adul|tery, and robbery, they con&s;tantly puni&s;h with death. If a majority condemn the criminal, he is executed on the &s;pot: the captain fir&s;t &s;trikes him with a club, and then the re&s;t of the judges fall upon him and drub him to death. In civil cau&s;es al&s;o, the matter is determined by a majority of votes, and &s;atisfaction immediately ordered the in|jured party out of the goods of the per&s;on that appears to be in the wrong. The whole country is but one common, where they feed their cattle promi&s;cuou&s;ly, moving from place to place to find water, or fre&s;h pa&s;ture. In every krail there is a phy&s;ician or two well &s;killed in the botany, &s;urgery, and medicine, of the Hottentots. They are cho&s;en out of the &s;ages of the krail, and perform without fee or reward. They have great &s;kill in the vir|tues of their herbs, and cup and handle a lancet well. If a patient dies under their hands, they always affirm that their remedies have been render|ed ineffectual by witchcraft.</P>
<P>With regard to the religion of the Hottentots, the Portugue&s;e, who were the fir&s;t Europeans that vi&s;ited the Cape, reported, that the Hottentots had no religion, becau&s;e they found neither temples nor images among them; but we have now the fulle&s;t evidence, that they believe in God, or the Supreme Being, who made the heavens and the earth, as they have declared to &s;everal mi&s;&s;ionaries, who lived among them. They &s;tile him the God of Gods, and believe he is endued with all imagin|able perfections: but they never addre&s;s them|&s;elves
<PB N="124" REF="1230">
directly to him, but to certain genii or de|mons, whom they look upon as mediators for them to the Supreme God: and it is probable, they look upon the moon as one of tho&s;e inferior intelligences, for they a&s;&s;emble at the new-moon, pro&s;trate them|&s;elves before it, and dance the whole night; and by &s;everal expre&s;&s;ions &s;hew their dependence on this inferior deity, from whom they expect good weather and fruitful &s;ea&s;ons. They wor&s;hip al&s;o tho&s;e that have had the reputation of &s;aints and heroes, and pay their devotions to an imaginary evil &s;pirit, like the Indians, whom they believe to be the author of all the calamities that they &s;uffer; and to him they &s;acrifice &s;heep and oxen, as well as to their &s;aints. They certainly believe a future &s;tate, by &s;acrificing and offering up their prayers to departed &s;aints; for this would be the greate&s;t ab&s;urdity, if they did not &s;uppo&s;e, that the &s;oul &s;urvived the body. Their removing their huts to different ground, when any one dies, &s;hews, that they are apprehen&s;ive, that the dead man may re|turn again, and give them &s;ome di&s;turbance; and that departed &s;ouls chiefly haunt the places where they died: a piece of &s;uper&s;tition which prevails every where almo&s;t.</P>
<P>There is no getting the better of the invincible reluctance the Hottentots have to adopt the Eu|ropean manners and cu&s;toms. For this rea&s;on the Dutch mi&s;&s;ionaries, with all their endeavours, have not been able to convert a &s;ingle Hottentot. Van|der Stel, a governor of the Cape, having procured a Hottentot infant, took care to have him brought up in the principles of the Chri&s;tian religion, and the manners and cu&s;toms of Europe. He cloathed him richly, had him taught &s;everal languages, and the boy's progre&s;s perfectly corre&s;ponded with the attention be&s;towed upon him. The governor, big with expectations from his pupil's capacity,
<PB N="125" REF="1240">
&s;ent him to the Indies with a commi&s;&s;ary-general, to be employed in the company's affairs; but the commi&s;&s;ary dying, he returned to the Cape, and in a vi&s;it he made to &s;ome of his relations a few days after his arrival, took the &s;trange re&s;olution of ex|changing all his European finery for a &s;heep's &s;kin. In this new dre&s;s he returned to the fort, loaded with a bundle containing the cloaths he had thrown off, and pre&s;enting him&s;elf before the governor, acco&s;ted him him thus: "Be &s;o kind, Sir, as to take notice, that I for ever renounce this apparel. I likewi&s;e for ever renounce the Chri&s;tian religion. It is my firm re&s;olution to live and die in the reli|gion, manners, and cu&s;toms of my ance&s;tors. All the favour I a&s;k from you, is to leave me the col|lar and hanger I wear; I &s;hall keep them for your &s;ake." The&s;e words were &s;carce out of his mouth, when he took to his heels, and was out of &s;ight, nor did he ever appear among the Europeans a|gain.</P>
<P>The Hottentots frequently expo&s;e their female children in their fore&s;ts to be &s;tarved or devoured by wild bea&s;ts, as they do their fathers and grandfa|thers, when they become decrepid and u&s;ele&s;s; but this is not with the con&s;ent of their magi|&s;trates, or chief men of the place. Notwith&s;tand|ing this their barbarity to their female children, they have the greate&s;t abhorrence to their being de&s;ected and cut in pieces, as they are &s;ometimes by the European &s;urgeons: they imagine this is done with a de&s;ign to u&s;e their fle&s;h in magic and witchcraft, and therefore watch the corp&s;e of the decea&s;ed &s;ometime after it is buried.</P>
<P>The Hottentots allow of poligamy, and al&s;o of divorce, upon a rea&s;onable complaint. Fortune is very little con&s;idered in their marriage; the man's father u&s;ually gives him a cow, and a few &s;heep, and the woman's father the like, on their marriage;
<PB N="126" REF="1250">
and the relations and friends of the married couple a&s;&s;i&s;t them in building a hou&s;e, or rather a hut: a fat ox is killed upon the occa&s;ion, and a wedding dinner provided &s;uitable to their circum&s;tances. The men form a circle in the area of the krail, and the women a&s;&s;emble in another circle. The bride|groom &s;its down in the middle of the men's circle, and the bride in that of the women's; after which, the prie&s;t comes into the circle, and pi&s;&s;es upon the bridegroom; from thence he goes to the women's circle, and pi&s;&s;es upon the bride, which is e&s;teem|ed the greate&s;t honour that can be done them; after which the married couple receive the congra|tulations of the company, wi&s;hing they may live long and happily together; that they may have a &s;on before the end of the year; that he may prove a brave fellow, an expert hunt&s;man, and the like. The meat being &s;erved up in earthen pans, the company fall to, and having neither knives nor forks, make u&s;e of their teeth and claws, pulling it to pieces, and eating as voraciou&s;ly as &s;o many dogs, having no other plates or napkins, than the corners of the &s;tinking mantles they wear, and &s;ea|&s;hells u&s;ually &s;erve them in&s;tead of &s;poons. After dinner, they &s;it &s;moaking and talking merrily on the occa&s;ion, 'till towards morning, when the bride &s;teals away, and the bridegroom after her, and then the company di&s;per&s;e. There is no dancing on the occa&s;ion, nor &s;trong liquor, the&s;e people &s;el|dom drinking any thing be&s;ides water and milk. The woman has not been married many days be|fore &s;he is &s;et to work, and treated little better than a &s;lave; all the bu&s;ine&s;s without doors and within is done by their wives; the more of which therefore a man has, the richer he is.</P>
<P>Our Engli&s;h &s;eamen, who have touched at the Cape, could never be reconciled to the Hottentots, but always con&s;idered them as the na&s;tie&s;t and mo&s;t
<PB N="127" REF="1260">
brutal people in the world. This is chiefly owing to their ill &s;mell, occa&s;ioned by their grea&s;ing them&s;elves continually; yet this is not a cu&s;tom peculiar to the Hottentots, being u&s;ed by mo&s;t of the negroes on the coa&s;t of Guinea. It is true, that the latter, generally &s;peaking, make u&s;e of oil, which is le&s;s offen&s;ive; but when they cannot get that, like the Hottentots, they content them&s;elves with &s;uch grea&s;e and kitchen-&s;tuff as they can pro|cure from the Europeans who trade with them. This cu&s;tom prevails likewi&s;e in the Ea&s;t Indies, particularly on the Malacca coa&s;t, but more e&s;pe|cially in the i&s;lands; as for in&s;tance, at Sumatra, where the natives grea&s;e them&s;elves as much, and &s;mell to the full as &s;trong as the Hottentots. The Javane&s;e likewi&s;e practi&s;e the &s;ame; and &s;o do the people of the Philippines, and of the Spice-i&s;lands; but then they commonly make u&s;e of cocoa nut oil, which is far from being di&s;agreeable.</P>
<P>This cu&s;tom of anointing is not altogether un|known to the Americans, tho' generally &s;peaking, they rather affect painting their bodies, either by way of ornament, or to make them appear more terrible to their enemies; or perhaps from the &s;ame cau&s;e, that the Indians and Hottentots are &s;aid to anoint them&s;elves, namely, to defend their naked bodies again&s;t the exce&s;&s;ive heat or cold of the weather. That anointing al&s;o was much practi&s;ed by the antient Jews, Greeks and Romans, is well known to all who have any knowledge of their manners and cu&s;toms.</P>
<P>As to the Cape of Good Hope, where the Dutch have their &s;ettlements, it was fir&s;t di&s;covered by Bartholomew Diaz, in the year 1493, when John the &s;econd was on the throne of Portugal. Diaz having met with &s;tormy weather in doubling the Cape, thought fit to call it Cabo Formento&s;o, that is the tempe&s;tuous cape; but the king, who from
<PB N="128" REF="1270">
other lights he had received, was enabled to form a right judgment of the importance of this di&s;covery, &s;tiled it Cabo del buena E&s;peranza, or the Cape of Good Hope, which name it hath retained ever &s;ince; for he &s;aw that the pa&s;&s;age was open, and that there wanted but one voyage more to fini&s;h what they had &s;o much de&s;ired, viz. the finding a direct pa&s;&s;age by &s;ea to the Ea&s;t Indies. It lies in latitude 34&deg;. 15&prime;. &s;outh, and longitude 20&deg;. 10&prime;. ea&s;t of London, and is now ju&s;tly e&s;teemed one of the mo&s;t important places in the hands of the Dutch Ea&s;t-India company. Tho' it is certain that the profits they draw from it are not comparable to tho&s;e ari&s;ing from &s;ome of their &s;ettlements in the Ea&s;t Indies, yet it would be impo&s;&s;ible to carry on their trade to the Ea&s;t Indies, if they were not po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of this place; becau&s;e at the Cape, and only at the Cape, they can meet with fre&s;h water, and other refre&s;hments, in their out|ward and homeward bound pa&s;&s;ages, which are ab|&s;olutely requi&s;ite, e&s;pecially for &s;uch as are eaten up with the &s;curvy, who &s;eldom fail to be recover|ed by the helps they meet with here.</P>
<P>Tho' the Portugue&s;e fir&s;t di&s;covered the Cape, and it had been often vi&s;ited both by them and the Engli&s;h before the Dutch took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it, yet neither thought it worth the keeping, and it had been actually fifty years in the hands of the Dutch, before they judged it capable of any improve|ments.</P>
<P>During that time, they only touched in their voyages to and from the Ea&s;t Indies, to traffic for provi&s;ions. For this purpo&s;e they went from time to time in bodies up into the country, and having thrown up a &s;mall fort near the harbour, they &s;e|cured them&s;elves, and their purcha&s;es in the night|time, 'till they could put them on board. After this manner the Dutch u&s;ed the Cape from 1600, to 1650, when their fleet anchoring before it, for
<PB N="129" REF="1280">
the u&s;ual purpo&s;e, M. Van Rebeck, a &s;urgeon be|longing to it, after having been &s;ome time on &s;hore, conceived in his mind the plan of almo&s;t all that has been &s;ince done. He ob&s;erved, that the coun|try was plentifully &s;tocked with cattle; that the &s;oil was rich; that the natives were tractable, and the harbour commodious and improveable; in a word, he &s;aw that it was highly advi&s;eable for the Dutch to make a &s;ettlement there. Accordingly in his pa&s;|&s;age home he dige&s;ted his thoughts in writing; and having laid his &s;cheme before the directors, they not only approved it, but fitted out immedi|ately a &s;quadron of four large &s;hips, laden with every thing requi&s;ite for putting it in execution, giving the &s;ole command to Van Rebeck, with in&s;tructions drawn from his own papers. This man laid the ba&s;is of his new e&s;tabli&s;hment in equity; he purcha&s;ed the country he re&s;olved to &s;ettle in from the natives, and gave them for it &s;uch goods as they cho&s;e, to the amount of fifty thou&s;and florins: he did not oblige them to re|move, nor did he put the lea&s;t con&s;traint upon their freedom. When they were di&s;po&s;ed to work, he paid them; when they were &s;ick, he relieved them. As they had not the u&s;e of letters, there could be no written agreement between them; he took no advantages of this: he performed his promi&s;es punctually, by which the natives came to have a confidence in the Dutch. It quickly appeared, that his notions were perfectly well founded, and that the country was every way capable of improve|ment. Every thing being &s;ettled with the natives to the &s;atisfaction of both parties, the governor be|gan to rai&s;e a fort, with dwelling-hou&s;es, ware|hou&s;es, and an ho&s;pital for the reception of the &s;ick. To this fort he added proper bulwarks, to &s;ecure him&s;elf again&s;t any attacks of the Europeans. But in proce&s;s of time, &s;ettlers multiplying very fa&s;t,
<PB N="130" REF="1290">
and trade increa&s;ing greatly, one of the governors, who&s;e name was Bax, took notice, that the compa|ny's &s;torehou&s;es, which were without the fort, would &s;oon be too &s;mall to receive all the company's mer|chandize at the Cape: he judged likewi&s;e, that there was a nece&s;&s;ity for augmenting the garri&s;on, &s;ince all the trading nations in Europe &s;aw, and began to envy the Dutch, the advantages they made of the Cape; and that therefore, it might ju&s;tly be apprehended, that one or other of tho&s;e na|tions would attempt to wre&s;t it from them. The&s;e things he repre&s;ented to the court of directors, and propo&s;ed to them the erecting a new fort on a more advantageous &s;ituation. This was accord|ingly done, and from time to time has been &s;o augmented, that at this day it is a very &s;trong and &s;tatlely building, and provided with all manner of accommodations for a garri&s;on. It covers the har|bour, and is of admirable defence towards the country; and the company's &s;torehou&s;es for mer|chandizes are very large and commodious. The fort and town are both &s;ituated on the &s;ide of a plain three leagues in extent, at the bottom of the three hills we mentioned at the beginning of this de&s;cription, namely the Table-hill, the Lion-hill, and another, by &s;ome called Sugar-loaf-hill, by others the Devil's hill, and by others the Windmill-hill. The fir&s;t, tho' very high, is very fertile, and has &s;everal fine &s;prings of water on its top, as clear as cry&s;tal, and of a very delicate ta&s;te. It is al&s;o adorned with &s;tately trees, groves, and arbours; and the beauty, variety, and fragrancy of the flowers, that grow in great plenty on its tops and &s;ides, are not to be expre&s;&s;ed, &s;ays Kolben, being more delight|ful to the eye, and more odoriferous than any he ever met with in Europe. On Lion-hill, which is &s;eparated from the former by a valley, is a hut
<PB N="131" REF="1300">
for the &s;helter of two men po&s;ted there by the go|vernor, to give notice, by &s;ignals, to the fortre&s;s at the Cape, of the appearance of any &s;hip making in. Windmill-Hill, which is the lowe&s;t of the three, yields excellent pa&s;ture, both for great and &s;mall cattle. The bay before the town is very fine and large, being of an oval form, about nine miles in circuit, and capable of holding an hundred &s;ail of large &s;hips, very commodiou&s;ly. The hou&s;es of which this town is compo&s;ed are exceeding neat, yet not above two &s;tories high, becau&s;e of the furious &s;outh-ea&s;t and north-we&s;t winds that &s;ometimes blow here. This is the &s;ixth government be&s;towed by the Dutch Ea&s;t-India company. The governor is always one of the council of the Indies, and has likewi&s;e a council to a&s;&s;i&s;t him in the admini&s;tration. There is &s;uch an abundance of all &s;orts of provi&s;ions at the Cape, that notwith&s;tanding the va&s;t annual de|mand, both by outward-bound and howeward|bound &s;hips of all nations, never any &s;carcity ari&s;es, but all &s;hips meet with the &s;uccours they expect, at a moderate rate. In order to have a ju&s;t notion of the great importance of this place, it will be proper to ob&s;erve, that, in the &s;pace of a year, at lea&s;t forty outward bound &s;hips touch there from Holland alone, and in the&s;e there cannot be le&s;s than eight or nine thou&s;and people. The homeward-bound &s;hips from the Indies cannot be fewer, in the &s;pace of a year, than thirty-&s;ix, and on board the&s;e there are u&s;ually three thou&s;and &s;ouls; not to &s;peak of foreign ve&s;&s;els that likewi&s;e put in here, and have al&s;o all kinds of refre&s;hments. This mu&s;t appear very extraordinary, when one con&s;iders what va&s;t quantities &s;uch numerous fleets mu&s;t require. But this is not all; the&s;e &s;hips do not enter the port, and &s;ail again directly, but continue there for &s;ome time, in&s;omuch that there are always &s;hips in the road, except in the
<PB N="13$" REF="1310">
months of May, June, and July, when it is dan|gerous on account of the north-we&s;t wind, that blows with the utmo&s;t violence during three months. In the company's garden here are the mo&s;t deli|cious fruits of A&s;ia and Europe, growing within &s;quares of bay hedges, &s;o high and thick that the &s;torms coming off the ocean can prejudice them but little; and the&s;e hedges afford a mo&s;t refre&s;h|ing &s;hade in the hot &s;ea&s;on. In this garden is al&s;o a fine grove of che&s;nut-trees, which the &s;un can|not penetrate. Here al&s;o we meet with peaches, pomegranates, citrons, lemons, and oranges, with the apples and pears of Europe intermixed, all ex|cellent in their kinds; and here we &s;ee the crim&s;on Japan apples, which, intermixed with the green leaves, appear exceeding beautiful. Here al&s;o grows the Indian guava. They have &s;carce any fruit-trees, the natural product of the country, at lea&s;t &s;uch as the Europeans care to ta&s;te of; tho' the Hottentots eat &s;ome of them. Three or four &s;orts of almond-trees have been brought hither, which bear fruit once in three years, and, as they have large plantations of them, yield the Dutch con&s;iderable profit. The ananas or pine apples, a mo&s;t delicious fruit, is al&s;o planted in this garden. Here we meet with four &s;orts of camphire trees, $he be&s;t whereof was tran&s;|planted from Borneo, the other three from Su|matra, Java, and Japan; the leaves, being rubbed between the fingers, &s;mell &s;trong of camphire. It was a great while before they rai&s;ed any con&s;idera|ble vineyards. They carried thither the fir&s;t vine|&s;tocks from the banks of the Rhine, and from Per|&s;ia, in &s;mall parcels, which grew pretty well, and furni&s;hed them with grapes for eating; but they did not pretend to make any quantities of wine, till a certain German taught them to take the prun|ings of their vines, and cut them in &s;mall pieces, and plant them in fields plowed up for that purpo&s;e,
<PB N="133" REF="1320">
by which means they were &s;oon furni&s;hed with as many &s;tocks and plants as they had occa&s;ion for; and now there is &s;carce a cottage in the Cape &s;et|tlement but has its vineyard, which produces wine enough for the family. Their plants of all &s;orts are larger and &s;weeter than tho&s;e of Europe; the head of a cabbage, at its full growth, weighing thirty or forty pounds; and the head of a cauliflower as much, the &s;eeds whereof are brought from Cy|prus and Savoy: their melons al&s;o are of an ex|ceeding fine flavour, and larger and whole&s;omer than tho&s;e of Europe; and are rai&s;ed without gla&s;&s;es or hot-beds, their &s;ummers being exce&s;&s;ive hot, and their winters moderate: their potatoes are very large, weighing from &s;ix to ten pounds; the&s;e they brought from India, and they are ex|ceeding good. In December all their grain is ripe, and our Chri&s;tmas is the height of their harve&s;t. In January they tread out their corn in the fields; and in February the farmers carry it to the compa|ny's magazines, where they receive ready money for all they do not u&s;e them&s;elves. They &s;ow al|mo&s;t all manner of grain but oats and lentiles.</P>
<P>For the civil and eccle&s;ia&s;tical government of this colony, and the admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice, there are eight colleges at the Cape; viz. a grand coun|cil, a court of ju&s;tice, a petty court of a&s;&s;aults, &amp;c. a court of marriage, a chamber of orphans, an ec|cle&s;ia&s;tical council, a common-council, and a board of militia; by means of all which, this colony is well regulated and governed.</P>
<P>The company have now a va&s;t territory here, the &s;oil of which is fruitful, the climate whole&s;ome and plea&s;ant, the country wonderfully improved, and daily improving, and this in the way mo&s;t to their advantage, that is, by agriculture, vineyards, and feeding of cattle, &s;o that their provi&s;ions and their people increa&s;e in the &s;ame proportion; and this
<PB N="134" REF="1330">
colony, in the &s;pace of a few years, will become, or rather is already become, &s;o populous, and the people, from their manner of living, &s;o vigorous and hardy, that they are not only &s;ecure from any attempts that other nations might make, but are al&s;o in a condition to furni&s;h &s;upplies of well &s;ea|&s;oned and &s;erviceable men, for the protection of any of their &s;ettlements in the Indies, in ca&s;e of emergencies.</P>
<P>The Dutch colonies or &s;ettlements in this coun|try at pre&s;ent are principally four: the fir&s;t is that at the Cape, where are the grand forts and the capi|tal city; the &s;econd, is the Hellenboge&s;h; the third, the Draken&s;tein; and the fourth, the Wave|ri&s;h colony. The company has likewi&s;e bought, for the future increa&s;e of the people, all that tract of land called Terra de Natal, lying between Mo&s;ambic and the Cape, for which they paid in toys, commodities, and uten&s;ils, to the value of thirty thou&s;and guilders. There are &s;ome Europeans, or at lea&s;t de&s;cendants from Europeans, who are &s;ettled upwards of three hundred leagues from the coa&s;ts. Of the pea&s;ants, there are &s;ome in very happy circum&s;tances, hav|ing, be&s;ides large and well cultivated plantations, great quantities of &s;heep and cattle. Of the colo|nies above-mantioned, that called Draken&s;tein, at eight leagues di&s;tance from the Cape, is entirely compo&s;ed of French refugees, who have there a large tract of country, well cultivated. They are allowed churches, mini&s;ters, and inferior magi&s;|trates, of their own nation.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the &s;tanding forces here, the Dutch, in ca&s;e of an attack, could draw together at lea&s;t five thou&s;and militia, well armed and di&s;ciplined; every pea&s;ant knowing whither to repair in order to range them&s;elves under his proper &s;tandard. There is u&s;ually one guard&s;hip, and that moored with &s;trong chains, the road being very un&s;afe, and &s;ub|ject
<PB N="135" REF="1340">
to frequent &s;torms. The Dutch generally im|port their &s;laves from the neighbouring i&s;land of Madaga&s;car, for they never make &s;laves of the Hottentots, but live in a friendly corre&s;pondence with them; &s;o that it is probable they would a&s;&s;i&s;t in the defence of the country, if ever it &s;hould be invaded.</P>
<P>The Hottentots, &s;o far as they have been yet di&s;|covered, con&s;i&s;t of &s;even different nations, all com|prehended under the general name of Hottentots. Part of them have &s;ubmitted them&s;elves, and are therefore &s;tiled the Company's Hottentots. The Dutch &s;end annually about fifty or &s;ixty per&s;ons to trade with the&s;e people, who purcha&s;e their cattle, and give them in exchange arrack, tobacco, hemp, and &s;uch garden-&s;eeds as they have occa&s;ion for; by which means a good under&s;tanding is pre|&s;erved.</P>
<P>Of all the &s;even Hottentot nations, that of the Caffres is repre&s;ented by the Dutch writers as the mo&s;t fierce, &s;avage, and uncivilized; but whe|ther the&s;e people are man-eaters, as we are al&s;o told, there is &s;ome rea&s;on to doubt.</P>
<P>This &s;ettlement is &s;aid to have co&s;t the Dutch a million of florins per ann. for twenty years, that is, altogether, two millions &s;terling; and at pre&s;ent the revenues ari&s;ing from the tenths of the profits which the government re&s;erves out of all the lands they grant to privateplanters, and from the cu&s;toms and exci&s;es, and from the &s;ale of goods at the Cape, does little more than balance the charges they are at in fortifying and garri&s;oning their towns and forts, in defraying the ordinary and extraordinary expence of the civil, military, and eccle&s;ia&s;tical e&s;tabli&s;hments, and maintaining an ho&s;pital for di&s;|ea&s;ed &s;eamen, together with the nece&s;&s;ary expence of their &s;hips, outward and homeward bound; for, though this is a very plentiful country, they have
<PB N="136" REF="1350">
few or no commodities proper for exportation, ex|cept wine, which is equal to any in Europe, and of which they have great variety. The principal ad|vantage this country is of to the Dutch is the &s;upply|ing their fleets with provi&s;ions, to and from India.</P>

<HEAD>TERRA DE NATAL.</HEAD>
<P>Terra de Natal, which, as we ob&s;erved above, has been purcha&s;ed by the Dutch, was &s;o called becau&s;e the Portugue&s;e di&s;covered it on the day of our Saviour's nativity. It lies between the latitude of 30 and 33&deg;. &s;outh. On the north it is bounded by the river Dellagoa; on the &s;outh by a chain of moun|tains; on the ea&s;t by the Indian Ocean; but how far backwards it extends we cannot pretend to &s;ay.</P>
<P>That part of the country which lies towards the &s;ea is &s;aid to be flat, and woody; but within land are many hills, intermixed with plea&s;ant vallies, plains, groves, and &s;avannahs, which are well wa|tered by the river of Natal, and other le&s;&s;er &s;treams. Elephants are &s;o plenty here, that they are &s;een feed|ing together, mornings and evenings, in herds of a thou&s;and or fifteen hundred, in the &s;avannahs or meadows; but in the heat of the day they retire in|to the woods. They are very peaceable, if not mo|le&s;ted. Here are al&s;o great numbers of buffaloes, bullocks, deer, hogs, conies, lions, tigers, &amp;c.</P>
<P>They have an odd way here of catching tur|tles or tortoi&s;es: taking a living &s;ucking fi&s;h, or remora, and fa&s;tening a couple of &s;trings to it, one at the head and another at the tail, they let it down into the water, on the turtle-ground; and when they find that the fi&s;h has fa&s;tened it&s;elf to the back of a turtle, as it will &s;oon do, they then draw it and the turtle up together. This way of fi&s;hing, it is &s;aid, is al&s;o u&s;ed at Madaga&s;car.</P>
<P>One of the ornaments of the Caffres, who are the natives of this country, is a piece of cow-hide,
<PB N="137" REF="1360">
made like a tail, which is fa&s;tened behind them, and reaches from their wai&s;t to the ground. When they are a little fuddled, and their mu&s;ic playing, they will &s;kip about, and &s;hake their tails, in a very di|verting manner.</P>
<P>Mr. Kolben &s;ays, the Caffres do not anoint or grea&s;e their bodies, as the other Hottentots; that they have nothing of the Hottentot &s;tammering, or manner of utterance; and that they &s;ow a &s;ort of Turki&s;h corn, and brew with it; whereas the other Hottentots neither &s;ow nor brew.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>TERRA DOS FUMOS.</HEAD>
<P>Terra dos Fumos &s;eems to be only a &s;mall part of the country &s;tiled, in a large &s;en&s;e, Terra de Na|tal. It extends from the mouth of the river De|lagoa to that of Rio de Ladroon, or the River of the Robbers. The Europeans have no &s;ettlement for trade here, and the Caffres, who inhabit the country, have neither towns, villages, nor any &s;et|tled dwellings.</P>
<P>To the north of the country of the Hottentots is the Land of Mozumbo Acalunga, which has the kingdom of Mataman on the we&s;t; the Hot|tentot Country on the &s;outh; Monomotopa on the ea&s;t; and the province of Ohila on the north.</P>
<P>Farther north is the kingdom of Abutua, or Bu|tua, which is &s;aid to be rich in gold mines. Dap|per &s;ays, that this province, which he calls Toro|ca or Toroa, begins to the &s;outh of the Mountains of the Moon, and extends northwards to the river Maginca, having the river Bravagul on the we&s;t. This country, we are told, abounds with gold, &s;il|ver, and precious &s;tones.</P>
<P>Towards the north-ea&s;t of Abutua we find the kingdom of Chicova, which is &s;aid to contain many &s;ilver mines.</P>

<HEAD>GUINEA.</HEAD>
<P>The va&s;t region known by the name of Guinea is divided into the Upper and Lower, the latter of which is al&s;o called Congo. The&s;e two together, reckoning from Cape Togrin, near the mouth of the river Sierra Leoni, in 9&deg;. 18&prime;. of north latitude, to Cape Negro, in 16&deg;. 45&prime;. of &s;outh latitude, ex|tend about two thou&s;and five hundred miles along the &s;ea-coa&s;t, and many more, if we reckon all the turnings, windings, and bays. As for its inland extent, it is not ea&s;y to a&s;certain it.</P>
<P>All this country lying between the tropics, the air is exce&s;&s;ive hot, e&s;pecially from the beginning of September to the end of March, which, with the coolne&s;s of the nights, the frequent thick, &s;tinking, &s;ulphureous mi&s;ts, and the periodical rains, when the flat country is all overflowed, makes it very unhealthy, e&s;pecially to Europeans, to whom it is generally fatal. The winds on the coa&s;t of Guinea Proper &s;et from we&s;t to ea&s;t, directly contrary to the trade|winds, except in the rainy &s;ea&s;on, between the ver|nal and autumnal equinox, when they have vio|lent &s;torms of wind, with terrible thunder and lightning; and the&s;e winds blowing from the &s;outh, the &s;hipping on the coa&s;t at this time are in great danger of being wrecked; and, even in the calme&s;t weather, there is always &s;uch a &s;urf beating upon the &s;hore, that it is very difficult and dange|rous landing. As to the face of the country, a variety of hills, vallies, woods, and plains, are &s;een all along the coa&s;t, intermixed with bogs and mora&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>The animals of Guinea are the &s;ame as tho&s;e of Caffraria; but their grain is different. Here is no wheat; but plenty of Guinea grain, rice, maiz,
<PB N="139" REF="1380">
or Indian corn. There are no grapes here; but the palm-tree affords them wine, and their cocoa-nuts a plea&s;ant drink. Here are al&s;o oranges and le|mons, plantains, pomegranates, tamarinds, pine|apples, and other tropical fruits.</P>
<P>Of fore&s;t-trees they have a great variety, which grow to a prodigious height and bulk; &s;ome of them being excellent timber, and having a very beautiful grain.</P>
<P>Their metals are gold, copper, and iron. The gold is found by the natives in the &s;ands of their rivulets in du&s;t; &s;ometimes they meet with large pieces, but there are no gold mines open, and po&s;|&s;ibly there may be no mines of that metal. As it is found wa&s;hed down into the brooks and rivulets in every place our people bring it from, it &s;eems probable that it lies pretty near the &s;urface. There is plenty of &s;alt on the Guinea coa&s;t, which they make by letting the &s;alt water into &s;hallow pans in the dry &s;ea&s;on, and the &s;un exhaling the water, the &s;alt is left at bottom.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides gold, ivory, and &s;laves, this country af|fords indigo, wax, gum-&s;enega, gum-tragant, and a variety of other gums and drugs. The&s;e articles may be had in mo&s;t parts of this exten&s;ive coa&s;t, but chiefly in Proper Guinea.</P>
<P>Of mountains in Guinea, the mo&s;t remarkable are tho&s;e of Sierra Leoni. The principal capes are tho&s;e of Cape Blanco, Cape Verd, Cape Leon, Cape St. Ann's, Cape Palmas, and Cape Three-Points, Cape Formo&s;a, Cape Monte, Cape St. John, Cape Lopas, Cape Lede, and Cape Negro. The chief bays are the Cyprian or Cintra Bay, and the Bite of Guinea. Of the rivers, the mo&s;t con&s;iderable are thoe of Coanzo and Ambri&s;i, the Zaara, the Lunde, the Cameron, the Formo&s;a, the Volta, the Sierra Leon, and the Sherbro. All the&s;e run from ea&s;t to
<PB N="140" REF="1390">
we&s;t, (except the Volta, which runs from north to &s;outh) and fall into the Atlantic.</P>
<P>The natives of Guinea, de&s;cended from the ori|ginal inhabitants, are all negroes, well known by their flat no&s;es, thick lips, and &s;hort woolly hair, though there are among them many camps or vil|lages of Arabs, who are of a tawny complexion; and there is a mixed breed of Mulattoes, proceed|ing from the commerce of the Portugue&s;e and na|tives, who are almo&s;t as dark as the negroes.</P>
<P>As to their habits, the common people have ge|nerally only a cloth about their middle; but peo|ple of condition have another over their &s;houlders, and are adorned with abundance of rings, and bracelets of gold, ivory, or copper: the arms, legs, and a great part of the bodies of the men are naked, but the women are veiled, when they go abroad.</P>
<P>The Europeans tell us, that the natives have ge|nerally more wit than hone&s;ty, frequently mixing their gold with ba&s;e metal; but there is rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect, that the little tricks and cheats they u&s;e in trade have been taught them by the Chri&s;tians with whom they traffic; and if the women are lewd, they are not wor&s;e than tho&s;e that accu&s;e them, who fir&s;t tempt them to incontinence, and then reproach them for it.</P>
<P>Every family almo&s;t in Guinea make their own tools and uten&s;ils: they are all &s;miths, car|penters, and ma&s;ons, building their own hou&s;es or huts, which are, indeed, of very &s;light materials; and, till the Europeans brought them hammers, &amp;c. one &s;tone &s;erved them for an anvil, and ano|ther for a hammer. The women manage all the hu&s;bandry, as well as their dome&s;tic affairs: they dig, &s;ow, plant, and bring in the harve&s;t, while the hu&s;band looks on; &s;o that the more wives a man has, the richer he is &s;aid to be in this country; and
<PB N="141" REF="1400">
&s;ome negroes on the coa&s;t make money by letting out their wives; and, indeed, they make little dif|ference between their wives and their &s;laves.</P>
<P>The &s;mall-pox is as fatal to the negroes as the plague, and worms are an epidemical di&s;tem|per; not tho&s;e in the &s;tomach and bowels, but a &s;pecies that are found between the &s;kin and the fle&s;h, and give the patient extreme pain, till they are drawn out, which is an operation that &s;ome|times takes a month to perform; for, if they at|tempt to draw it out too ha&s;tily, the worm breaks, and rots in the fle&s;h, or breaks out in another place. Some negroes have nine or ten of the&s;e worms in their &s;kin at once, and the Europeans are not entire|ly free from them. A greedy ravenous appetite is al&s;o reckoned among the di&s;ea&s;es of the Guinea negroes; and the venereal di&s;ea&s;e is often fatal to them, having no effectual methods of cure of their own; nor are the wounds they receive in the field of Mars le&s;s dangerous than the other, e&s;pecially if the bones are &s;hattered; for they can cure only or|dinary fle&s;h wounds, which they do by applying poultices of herbs. The negroes are &s;eldom long|lived, tho' they are generally healthful, while they live.</P>
<P>The di&s;tempers the Europeans are &s;ubject to on this coa&s;t are, fevers, fluxes, and cholics, which are occa&s;ioned by indifferent water, and bad air; their &s;ettlements lying near the coa&s;t, where the fogs and &s;teams ari&s;ing from the ooze and &s;alt mar&s;hes, and the &s;tinking fi&s;h the natives dry on the beach, corrupt the air, and render it fatal to fo|reigners. The mo&s;t temperate men find it diffi|cult to pre&s;erve their health; but a great many ha&s;ten their death by their intemperance, or negli|gence, expo&s;ing them&s;elves to the cold air in the evening, after a very hot day. This &s;udden change,
<PB N="142" REF="1410">
from one extreme to the other, has often very bad effects in hot climates.</P>
<P>As to religion, the natives generally acknow|ledge one Supreme Almighty Being, that created the univer&s;e; and yet pay him no manner of wor|&s;hip or adoration, never praying to him, or giving him thanks for any thing they enjoy. They be|lieve he is too far exalted above poor mortals to take any notice of them, and therefore pray to a multitude of $Span$ deities, of which there are &s;ome common to whole nations; and yet every man has a god of his own chu&s;ing be&s;ides.</P>
<P>In Guinea there are &s;ome &s;overeign princes, who&s;e dominions are very exten&s;ive, rich, power|ful, and them&s;elves arbitrary, limited by no laws, or any other re&s;traint; and there are many others, to whom the Dutch and other Europeans have given the name of kings, who&s;e dominions do not ex|ceed the bounds of an ordinary pari&s;h, and who&s;e power and revenues are proportionably mean.</P>

<HEAD>UPPER-GUINEA.</HEAD>
<P>The mo&s;t general divi&s;ion of Upper-Guinea is into three parts, Malagueta, Guinea Proper, and Benin.</P>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>MALAGUETA.</HEAD>
<P>The country of Malagueta is generally known under the name of the Grain Coa&s;t, from the para|di&s;e grain, or Guinea pepper, called malagueta in Spani&s;h, which grows here in great plenty.</P>
<P>The chief place frequented by the Europeans on this coa&s;t is Sherbro, the capital of a petty king|dom of the &s;ame name. Sherbro river is naviga|ble for canoes a great way up, and the main article of trade there is cam-wood. Near the mouth of this river is York-I&s;land, on which the Engli&s;h had
<PB N="143" REF="1420">
once a factory, and good fort, now in ruins. Ano|ther i&s;land here, called Farellons, abounds with poultry, rice, potatoes, bananas, and orange and lemon trees.</P>
<P>About twenty-five leagues di&s;tant from the mouth of the river Sherbro, to the &s;outh-ea&s;t, is Cape Monte. This part of the country is very populous, and the negroes extremely indu&s;trious, particularly in planting rice, and boiling &s;alt.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>GUINEA-PROPER.</HEAD>
<P>The country of Guinea-Proper extends from Cape Palmas to the river Volta, about an hundred and fifty leagues along the &s;ea coa&s;t, which bounds it to the &s;outh. It has the kingdom of Benin on the ea&s;t; Gago and Melli, on the north; and Malagueta on the we&s;t. The Europeans divide it into two parts, the Tooth and the Gold Coa&s;t; the former extending from Cape Palmas to the river Sueira da Ca&s;ta, eighteen miles we&s;t of the river Mancha, by &s;ome called Rio-Cobre, and Auke|ber; and the latter from thence to the river Volta.</P>
<P>The Tooth, Ivory, or Quaqua Coa&s;t, is &s;o call|ed from the great plenty of elephants teeth found there. According to Dapper, the inhabitants of this coa&s;t, though they &s;eem the mo&s;t barbarous and &s;avage people of all Guinea, are really the mo&s;t civilized and the mo&s;t rea&s;onable, and pa&s;s for &s;uch among their neighbours. When they come to trade with any &s;hip, they take &s;ome water into their hands, and let a few drops of it fall into their eyes, which is a kind of oath, by which they intimate, that they would rather lo&s;e their eye-&s;ight than cheat tho&s;e they trade with. They are no le&s;s aver&s;e to drunkenne&s;s than to fraud; and though their country produces numbers of palm-trees, yet they drink no palm-wine, but only a certain liquor call|ed
<PB N="144" REF="1430">
bordon, or tombo-wine, which they mix with water. Their chief manufactures and trade con&s;i&s;ts in cotton habits, which are called Quaqua gowns, and are made of five or &s;ix breadths &s;ewed toge|ther. One of the fundamental laws of this coun|try is, that every one is obliged to continue all his life-time in the condition in which he was born; &s;o that one who&s;e father was a fi&s;herman, for in|&s;tance, can never become any thing el&s;e but a fi&s;h|erman, and &s;o of all other trades and profe&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>The Gold-Coa&s;t had its name given it by the Portugue&s;e, from the immen&s;e quantity of that pre|cious metal it produces: the &s;ame rea&s;on has made all the other nations of Europe retain the &s;ame ap|pellation. According to the be&s;t charts, founded upon the late&s;t ob&s;ervations, the &s;ituation of the Gold-Coa&s;t is between 4&deg;. 30&prime;. and 8&deg;. north lati|tude, and 16&deg;. and 18&deg;. 4&prime;. of longitude, begin|ning at the river Ankobar, and extending to the Rio Volta, that is, about an hundred and thirty leagues, from we&s;t to ea&s;t. The beginning of the Gold-Coa&s;t, however, is placed by many at Rio de Suiero da Co&s;ta, near I&s;nui, that being the fir&s;t place where gold is found; and the end at Lay, in the country of Lampi, three or four leagues from Akra, becau&s;e there the gold is procured but acci|dentally, from a people called Amaho, inhabiting the more di&s;tant interior country.</P>
<P>This coa&s;t contains a variety of different king|doms and &s;tates, viz. Adomir, called likewi&s;e Sa|ku, and Avina; Axim; Ankobar; Adom, like|wi&s;e called Little Inka&s;&s;an, or War&s;hes; Jabi, or Jabs; Commendo, or Guaffo: Fetu; Sabo; Fan|tin; Ackron; Agonna, or Anguirra; Amra, or Aquambus; Lubbade; and Ningo, or Lampi. Each of the above divi&s;ions, provinces, or king|doms, have one, two, or more towns or villages
<PB N="145" REF="1440">
on the &s;ea-coa&s;t, between or under the European forts and &s;ettlements. Eight of them are real mo|narchies, having their own proper kings, who, be|fore the arrival of the Europeans, were called cap|tains; the re&s;t are republics, governed by magi&s;|trates, who are &s;ubject to the laws, and periodical changes. Upon the river Cobre or Ankobar, and in the country of that name, which is properly the fir&s;t country of the Gold-Coa&s;t, there are a number of towns, in the three provinces of Ankobar, A|borrel or Abocro, and Eguira. The fir&s;t is a mo|narchy; the two latter republics. For a number of years the Dutch had a fort at Eguira, and their gold trade, be&s;ides what they drew from the neigh|bouring countries, was very con&s;iderable, this can|ton having its own proper mines; but lo&s;t all their footing in the country by a quarrel with the negroes.</P>
<P>Eight leagues ea&s;t of Cape Apollonia &s;tands the town of Axim, the canton of which produces a pro|digious quantity of rice, water-melons, ananas, ba|nanas, cocoas, oranges, lemons of two different kinds, with abundance of other fruits, and vegeta|bles of all &s;orts. As to the maize, or Indian corn; it is neither plentiful nor good, by rea&s;on of the hu|midity and moi&s;ture of the &s;oil. So continual is the rain here, that, according to a proverb of the country, it rains eleven months and twenty-nine days in the year. The natives export rice to all the kingdoms of the coa&s;t, bringing home millet, yams, potatoes, and palm-oil. Axim produces likewi&s;e great numbers of black cattle, &s;heep, goats, and tame pigeons, as well as other fowls. The whole country is well cultivated, and filled with populous villages, &s;ome on the &s;ea-&s;ide, others farther up the country, all of them rich and beautiful. The natives maintain a con&s;tant traf|fic in gold with the Europeans. Axim, or A|chombona, the capital, &s;tands under the cannon of the Dutch fort, called Fort St. Anthony,
<PB N="146" REF="1450">
which is one of the plea&s;ante&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hments in Guinea; but that advantage is greatly dimini&s;hed by the humidity of the air, and unhealthine&s;s of the climate, particularly in the rainy &s;ea&s;ons. This fort was taken from the Portugue&s;e in the year 1642. The garri&s;on is u&s;ually compo&s;ed of twen|ty-five white men, and an equal number of ne|groes, under the command of a &s;erjeant. It is maintained at the expence of the We&s;t-India com|pany; and, when well furni&s;hed with &s;tores and provi&s;ions, capable of making a long defence, again&s;t any number of negroes. The &s;ituation of the fort is ea&s;t of the river Axim, which the Por|tugue&s;e call Rio Manco, a river navigable only by canoes, but rich in gold du&s;t, wa&s;hed down by the &s;tream from the inland countries.</P>
<P>At Mount Man&s;ore, which is the fir&s;t point of Cape Tres Puntas, or Three Points, three leagues ea&s;t of Fort St. Anthony, is the Dutch factory, called Frederic&s;burgh, mounting forty-&s;ix pieces of cannon, on four batteries, which formerly belonged to the Pru&s;&s;ians. The climate here is as healthy as any in Guinea, and the &s;urrounding country rich and well cultivated. Be&s;ides the great quantity of gold found in the rivers, the inhabitants carry on a con|&s;iderable trade in ivory and &s;laves, be&s;ides the pro|fits ari&s;ing from the &s;alt made by the women for their amu&s;ement.</P>
<P>Cape Tres Puntas, of which we have made fre|quent mention, had its name given it by the Portu|gue&s;e, from its being compo&s;ed of three points or eminences, projecting into the &s;ea. Each of the&s;e hills is cloathed with beautiful woods, which are &s;een a great way off at &s;ea. Upon the &s;hore of the two bays, between them, &s;tand the three villages of An|kora, Akron, and Dick&s;cove. Near Ankora is a Dutch &s;ettlement, called Fort Dorothea. Dick&s;|cove &s;tands two miles to the ea&s;t of Dorothea, and
<PB N="147" REF="1460">
belongs to the Engli&s;h, who are charged with deal|ing much in fal&s;e gold there; the imitation being &s;o artful, that it is hardly po&s;&s;ible for &s;trangers in the trade to di&s;tingui&s;h the fal&s;e from the pure and genuine.</P>
<P>Eight leagues ea&s;t of Ankora begins the king|dom of Anta. The land here is well watered, and the vallies rich and exten&s;ive, producing rice in abundance, maize of the be&s;t &s;ort, &s;ugar canes, yams, and potatoes, the large&s;t on the whole coa&s;t.</P>
<P>The Dutch have a &s;ettlement here, called Bour|try, on the banks of a river of the &s;ame name. The &s;ituation is extremely plea&s;ant, and the mo&s;t healthy on the coa&s;t. On both &s;ides of the ri|ver are &s;een infinite numbers of monkeys, apes, tigers, wild cats, &s;ome elephants, with cows, hor&s;es, &s;heep, hogs, and all kinds of birds. Toko|rari, or, as the Engli&s;h call it, Tokarado, is a village near Bourtry, the inhabitants of which have the reputation of building the be&s;t canoes of any in Guinea. Six miles from Bourtry &s;tands Sukon|da, a rich and plea&s;ant village, much noted for the clemency and healthfulne&s;s of the air. Here both the Engli&s;h and Dutch have factories, and the factors of both nations have con&s;tant opportunities of each other's company, when they happen to live in har|mony and friend&s;hip; an advantage of ine&s;timable value to rational and &s;ocial beings, placed in this barbarous and ignorant country. It is remarkable, that the natives of this coa&s;t are ever harra&s;&s;ed with a fames canina, boulimy, or in&s;atiable appe|tite, ari&s;ing, as &s;ome imagine, from the liberal u&s;e of kri&s;ca, a kind of wine common in this place. At Sama, one of the large&s;t towns on the whole coa&s;t, &s;ituated on the plea&s;ant river of St. George, not far from Sukonda, to the ea&s;t, the Dutch have a fort, called Fort St. Seba&s;tian. A little farther ea&s;t lies the country of Jabi or Jabbah, which
<PB N="148" REF="1470">
extends quite to that of Commendo called al&s;o Commany, Komany, Ague&s;to, and Guaffo. The di|men&s;ions of the latter are about five miles along the &s;ea-coa&s;t, and about as many up the country. It produces but little rice; yet are the valleys no le&s;s fertile than agreeable, and the hills covered with wood, which affords the mo&s;t delightful pro&s;pect. At the village of Little Commendo both the Engli&s;h and Dutch have factories. The former, according to Smith, next to Cape Coa&s;t, is the principal for|tification the Engli&s;h have in Guinea, at lea&s;t on the Gold-Coa&s;t. The Dutch fort, called Woden|bourgh, is but a mu&s;ket-&s;hot off; but the advan|tages ari&s;ing from &s;o near a vicinity are lo&s;t by the quarrels and jealou&s;ies that almo&s;t continually &s;ub|&s;i&s;t between the two nations. The principal com|modities for which there is a demand by the negroes of Commendo are, gla&s;s beads, bra&s;s bells, buttons, long linen cloths, and woollen &s;tuffs. The former they &s;end up the country; the latter they keep for their own con&s;umption. When they are at war with neighbouring nations, trading thither for &s;laves is profitable; for they hurry to di&s;po&s;e of their pri&s;oners, to &s;ave the expence of maintaining them: a &s;hip arriving, on &s;uch an occa&s;ion, is &s;ure of compleating her cargo in a few days. The negroes of Commendo are infamous for adulte|rating their gold.</P>
<P>The next country to the ea&s;t is the kingdom of Fetu, which is &s;aid to be an hundred and &s;ixty miles in length, and near as much in breadth, be|ginning at Mount Jago, or the river Sel, and ter|minating at Mount Mafro, or Mountfort. This country is extremely well &s;ituated for European &s;ettlements, by rea&s;on of the neighbouring trading kingdoms, and the conveniency and cheapne&s;s of living. Three miles from Wodenburg &s;tands the Dutch fort of La Mina, or St. George Elmina,
<PB N="149" REF="1480">
in the centre of the Gold-Coa&s;t. It is beyond con|tradiction one of the mo&s;t compleat on the coa&s;t, and very commodiou&s;ly &s;ituated for the purpo&s;e of trade, and the protection and &s;ecurity of the trader. The garri&s;on is compo&s;ed of an hundred white men, and an equal number of free negroes, in the pay of the company. Near it is another fort, on a hill, called Conrad&s;bourg.</P>
<P>Nine miles from Elmina is Cape Coa&s;t, the chief Engli&s;h &s;ettlement in Guinea. The name is thought to be a corruption of Cabo Cor&s;o, the antient Portu|gue&s;e appellation. The cape on which the fort &s;tands is formed by an angular point, wa&s;hed on the &s;outh and ea&s;t by the &s;ea. The Portugue&s;e &s;ettled here in 1610; but were di&s;lodged, a few years af|terwards, by the Dutch. In 1664 it was demoli&s;h|ed by admiral Holmes, after his expedition again&s;t Fort Wit&s;in, at Taberari. In 1665 De Ruyter, with a &s;quadron of thirteen men of war, attacked all the Engli&s;h &s;ettlements along the coa&s;t, ruined the factories, and took, burnt, and &s;unk all the &s;hipping of the Engli&s;h company; but, after all his endeavours, he was fru&s;trated in his attempts on this fort, although, at that time, it had not re|covered the damage done it by Holmes. The treaty of Breda having confirmed Cape Coa&s;t to the Engli&s;h, and the king granting a new charter in 1672, the directors applied all their attention to fortifying and rendering commodious this their chief po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. It is now large, &s;trong, and com|modious, well furni&s;hed with artillery and warlike &s;tores, and commanding an exten&s;ive beautiful pro&s;pect. There are, however, &s;ome neighbouring hills, by means of which it would be no difficult matter for an enemy greatly to embarra&s;s and an|noy the fort. The &s;oldiers at Cape Coa&s;t are lodged in the be&s;t barracks of any upon the coa&s;t of Guinea, and receive their pay daily in gold-du&s;t.
<PB N="150" REF="1490">
Here are al&s;o convenient apartments for the &s;laves, who, in this particular, are treated with great hu|manity, with forges for &s;miths, &s;heds and work|hou&s;es for carpenters and other mechanics, toge|with a convenient public kitchen, for the u&s;e of the &s;ettlement. In Barbot's time, there was a &s;chool for the in&s;truction of negro children, to initiate them in reading, writing, and the principles of the Chri&s;tian religion: whether it &s;till remains, is what we cannot take upon us to affirm. A little way from the gate is a pri&s;on for murderers, traitors, and other criminals, convicted of capital crimes; where they are detained till an occa&s;ion offers for &s;ending them over to England, to take their final trial. Finally, there is cut in the rock, beneath the platform, a large vault for the confinement of &s;laves that are purcha&s;ed for exportation. It is di|vided into a number of cells, and well contrived, to prevent their revolting, or forming con&s;pira|cies. The ci&s;tern for pre&s;erving their rain-water, by which the fort is chiefly &s;upplied, is capable of hold|ing four hundred hog&s;heads. They have no water be&s;ides this, but what is brought at a con&s;iderable di&s;tance. The trade here is chiefly in gold-du&s;t and &s;laves; the former being returned to Europe, laid out in trade, or the purcha&s;e of &s;laves for the We&s;t Indies. The chief beauty of this place is the gardens, which are eight miles in circumference, all that &s;pace going by this name that is planted with trees. There the &s;oil is fertile, producing e|very &s;ort of fruit that is to be found in warmer climates, as lemons, oranges, citrons, guavas, mangoes, plantains, bananas, pine-apples, tama|rinds, cucumbers, water-melons, cocoa-nuts, cin|namon, and every kind of &s;allads and roots. It is believed the cinnamon tree would grow here to great perfection, if properly cultivated.</P>
<P>There are many barren mountains in the king|dom of Fetu; but the valleys are in general fer|tile
<PB N="151" REF="1500">
and rich, except round Cape Coa&s;t, where the land is dry and &s;terile. The fi&s;h here are excellent and abundant; the fowls, e&s;pecially the Mu&s;covia ducks, good and cheap; the mutton and goats fle&s;h lean and in&s;ipid, beef &s;carce, and pigeons in great plenty. Three quarters of a mile from the cape are two other &s;mall forts; one called Philip's Tower, and the other Fort-Royal, or Queen Ann's Fort.</P>
<P>Next to Fetu lie the &s;mall kingdoms of Sabu and Fantin. The fir&s;t produces an amazing quan|tity of Indian corn, potatoes, yams, bananas, o|ranges, lemons, and other fruits; be&s;ides palm-oil, with which it &s;upplies the countries of Akra and Axim. In this little kingdom the Engli&s;h have a fort, on Queen Ann's Point, about a mile from Fort Royal, and two miles from Mawri, or Mou|ra, where the Dutch have a fort, called Fort Na&s;|&s;au. The chief trade of this place con&s;i&s;ts in crude gold-du&s;t, with which canoes every day arrive from all the &s;ea-port towns.</P>
<P>The Engli&s;h and Dutch have each their &s;eparate forts in Fantin, and the former have three &s;mall lodges be&s;ides. The Engli&s;h &s;ort is at Anamaboa, or Jemi&s;ia, which is &s;aid to be a hand&s;ome large town. The country about Anamaboa is populous, and exceeding rich in gold and &s;laves, and all the ne|ce&s;&s;aries of life; but more particularly in corn, which they &s;ell in large quantities to the Europe|ans. In the woods of this country are found the mo&s;t beauiful paroquets in the world, and an in|finity of other birds.</P>
<P>The Dutch fort, called Fort Am&s;terdam, &s;tands about a cannon-&s;hot from Great Cormantin, a large populous town, &s;ituated on a high hill.</P>
<P>The natives of Fantin are repre&s;ented as a hardy, bold, intrepid people, and &s;urprizingly artful in deba&s;ing and counterfeiting the precious metal.</P>
<P><PB N="152" REF="1510">
Next to Fantin lie the kingdoms of Acron Agonna, and Aquamboe. The fir&s;t extends along the &s;ea-coa&s;t, from Fantin to the mount called Monte del Diabolo, or the Devil's Mountain. The only European &s;ettlement in this kingdom is that of the Dutch at the village of Apam, called Leyd&s;aamkeyd, or Patience. Harts, hares, par|tridges, and phea&s;ants, with various other kinds of wild-fowl and quadrupeds, are here in great abun|dance and perfection.</P>
<P>The country of Agonna begins at the Devil's Mount, &s;tretching along the coa&s;t to the village of Anon&s;a, on the frontiers of Aquamboe or Acra, a &s;pace of &s;ixteen miles. According to mo&s;t au|thors, it is rich in mines; but none of them ap|pear to have been ever opened. At the village of Simpa, or Winiba, the Engli&s;h have, or at lea&s;t once had a &s;mall fort; and the Dutch have ano|ther at Barku. The country is, in general, plea|&s;ant and fertile. The language, which hitherto is the &s;ame all along the Gold-Coa&s;t, it is &s;aid, begins here to change; fir&s;t into a different dialect, and, a little further, into a quite different language.</P>
<P>The kingdom of Aquamboe, which is one of the greate&s;t monarchies on the coa&s;t of Guinea, being bounded on the ea&s;t by the river Volta, on the we&s;t by Agonna, and extending for the &s;pace of twenty miles along the &s;ea-coa&s;t, and about two hundred into the inland parts. That part of it which lies on the &s;ea-coa&s;t is called Acra. The Engli&s;h, Dutch, and Danes, have each a fort here. That of the Engli&s;h is called Fort James, that of the Dutch Creveceur, and that of the Danes Chri&s;|tain&s;burg. The la&s;t is the only one the Danes po&s;&s;e&s;s on this coa&s;t. Here is a great trade in gold and &s;laves; the number of the latter being at lea&s;t equal to what is di&s;po&s;ed of on the whole coa&s;t be|&s;ides, not excepting Anamaboa.</P>

<HEAD>BENIN.</HEAD>
<P>Benin, which makes the third divi&s;ion of Up|per-Guinea, has the Gold-Coa&s;t on the we&s;t; Ga|go, Biafara, with the De&s;ert of Sith, on the north; Mujaac and Makoko on the ea&s;t; and part of Congo, with the Ethiopic Ocean, on the &s;outh. It is commonly divided into two parts, viz. Why|dah and Ardah, which con&s;titute what is called the Slave-Coa&s;t, and Benin-Proper.</P>
<P>The country called by the Engli&s;h Whydah, by the Portugue&s;e Juda, and by the Dutch Fida, is bounded on the we&s;t by the river Volta; on the &s;outh by the Gulph of Guinea; on the ea&s;t by the kingdom of Ardah; and on the north by the king|dom of Dahomy. Whydah is allowed by all who have been there to be one of the mo&s;t delightful countries in the world. The great number and variety of tall, beautiful, and &s;hady trees, which &s;eem as if planted in fine groves for ornament; the verdant fields every where cultivated, and no otherwi&s;e divided than by tho&s;e groves, or pretty little villages, encompa&s;&s;ed by a low mud-wall, and &s;cattered over the face of the whole country, con&s;pire to afford the mo&s;t delightful pro&s;pect that imagination can form. There is neither mountain nor hillock to hinder ones pro&s;pect, the whole country being a fine, ea&s;y, and almo&s;t impercepti|ble a&s;cent, for the &s;pace of forty or fifty miles from the &s;ea; &s;o that from any part of this kingdom one may have a pro&s;pect of the &s;ea, and the farther you go from it the more beautiful and populous the country is, which neverthele&s;s yields no gold; but what they have here is brought from Brazil by the Portugue&s;e, to purcha&s;e &s;laves.</P>
<P>The natives of this country are &s;aid to be the mo&s;t polite negroes in Guinea, and very indu&s;tri|ous, but unacquainted with arms: hence it was,
<PB N="154" REF="1530">
that they made but a poor defence again&s;t the king of Dahomy, when he attacked and &s;ubdued them, about the year 1724, and afterwards loaded them with heavy taxes. They wor&s;hip &s;everal &s;orts of deities. Among the&s;e is a large beautiful kind of &s;nake, which is inoffen&s;ive in its nature; the &s;ea, and tall trees.</P>
<P>Though this country in general be very fine, yet it is very unwhole&s;ome, and has become more &s;o &s;ince the king of Dahomy conquered it, as the lands have not been near &s;o well cultivated as they were before that revolution.</P>
<P>The king had commonly about four or five thou&s;and wives, the great men commonly about three or four hundred, and others forty or fifty. When the king's wives went into the field to work, which they did daily in large companies, they u&s;ed to cry out, when they &s;aw a man, "Stand clear;" upon which, the man fell flat on the ground, till they had pa&s;&s;ed him.</P>
<P>The king was feared and reverenced by his &s;ub|jects as a demi-god; they always appeared in his pre&s;ence kneeling, or pro&s;trate on the ground. When they attended him in the morning, they pro&s;trated them&s;elves before the gate of the palace, ki&s;&s;ed the earth three times, and, clapping their hands together, made u&s;e of &s;ome expre&s;&s;ions, that looked more like the adoration of &s;ome deity than compliments paid to an earthly prince; and they even trembled at the &s;ight of him. No per&s;on whatever was permitted to &s;ee his maje&s;ty eat, or to know in what part of the palace he &s;lept, except his wives, who were his life-guards, and were fre|quently &s;ent on emba&s;&s;ies, and employed in exe|cuting &s;uch commands and &s;entences, as &s;eemed much more proper for men; &s;uch as puni&s;hing criminals, pulling down their hou&s;es, and the like.</P>
<P><PB N="155" REF="1540">
When the king went abroad, five or &s;ix hun|dred of his wives u&s;ed to attend or run before him. He had not, it is &s;aid, a &s;ingle man in his train.</P>
<P>From the multiplicity of wives, it is not uncom|mon for a man to have two hundred children liv|ing at once, or to have half a dozen born to him in one day; for they never cohabit with any of their wives when pregnant or men&s;trous: be|&s;ides, the more children a man has, the richer he is or may be, as he can di&s;po&s;e of them all at plea&s;ure, except his elde&s;t &s;on.</P>
<P>Both men and women go with their heads &s;horn and uncovered, though the &s;un is &s;corching hot; but in other re&s;pects are cloathed, the latter howe|ver, &s;o loo&s;ely, that the wind often di&s;clo&s;es their natural beauties, which, the men &s;ay, was a fa&s;hion invented by the women for a certain purpo&s;e. Circumci&s;ion is u&s;ed here; but often not till the child is four, five, or even eight years old.</P>
<P>The negroes here, and the kingdom of Benin, live much better than tho&s;e on the Gold-Coa&s;t. Here they eat beef, mutton, and fowls, and are very ho&s;pitable to &s;trangers, as well as to their own countrymen; but, on the Gold-Coa&s;t, millet boil|ed to the con&s;i&s;tence of bread, is their common food, or el&s;e potatoes, yams, and other roots, $n the room of it, well drenched in palm or cocoa-nut oil, and to this they &s;ometimes add boiled herbs, and half-dried &s;tinking fi&s;h; for they always let them lie on the beach till they &s;tink. On the Gold-Coa&s;t they have al&s;o a di&s;h called malaget, which is a mixture of ground corn and palm oil, boiled together. Garden beans, and other pul&s;e, with plantains, bananas, and other fruits, roa&s;ted in the a&s;hes, likewi&s;e &s;erve them for food. All over the Guinea-Coa&s;t, they are too apt to drink to exce&s;s. In the morning they drink drams, and
<PB N="156" REF="1550">
palm-wine in the afternoon. Even the chiefs of their great towns, or kings, as the Dutch call them, will meet the meane&s;t of their &s;ubjects in the market-place in the evening, and, forming a circle on the ground, drink to great exce&s;s, being attended by their women, who are no le&s;s addicted to drunkenne&s;s than the men, who&s;e conver&s;ation is u&s;ually as &s;mutty as that of a drunken crew of &s;ail|ors; nor does this at all &s;hock the mode&s;ty of the negroe females, who maintain their ground, and &s;it drinking and &s;moaking with the men till morn|ing. Be&s;ides their palm-wine, they have &s;trong beer, made of millet; few or none of them drink|ing water, which is e&s;teemed the mo&s;t unwhole|&s;ome of all liquors on this coa&s;t.</P>
<P>The two principal places in Whydah are, that which gives name to the kingdom, and Sabec, where the Engli&s;h, French, and Portugue&s;e, have forts and factories.</P>
<P>Adjoining to Whydah are &s;everal petty king|doms, as Cato, Little and Great Popo, and Qua|hoe, all, except the la&s;t, lying on the coa&s;t; but it does not appear that there are any European fac|tories in them, though they trade in &s;laves. Qua|hoe is &s;aid to abound al&s;o in gold, which the in|habitants carry through Aquamboe to Acra.</P>
<P>Ardrah, or Ardah, a con&s;iderable kingdom, has Whydah on the we&s;t; the Gulph of Guinea on the &s;outh; and Benin Proper on the ea&s;t; but how far it extends northward, or on what country it borders, we are not told. At Jackin, in this king|dom, about forty miles from the mouth of the ri|ver Volta, is an Engli&s;h factory.</P>
<P>The country of Dahomy, who&s;e king conquered not only the kingdom of Whydah, as we ob&s;erved above, but al&s;o that of Ardah, in 1724, is &s;ituated to the north of the Slave Coa&s;t, and extends a va&s;t
<PB N="157" REF="1560">
way inland. The trade of the natives is chiefly in &s;laves, and &s;ome gold.</P>
<P>Benin Proper has part of the Gulph of Guinea, and the Slave Coa&s;t, or Ardah, on the we&s;t; part of Gago, and Biafara, or Brafera, on the north; Mujac and Makoko on the ea&s;t; and Congo on the &s;outh. Its extent, from we&s;t to ea&s;t, is about &s;ix hundred miles; but that from &s;outh to north is not yet a&s;certained. The country abounds with wild bea&s;ts, as elephants, tigers, leopards, bears; and with game, as harts, hares, partridges, pigeons, turtle-doves, &amp;c. The &s;oil al&s;o produces a great variety of trees and plants, as orange, lemon, and e&s;pecially cotton trees, with pepper, but not in &s;uch quantities as in the Ea&s;t-Indies. The natives here are generally good-natured and civil, and are ea&s;ily managed by tho&s;e who know their way. Few of them are laborious or indu&s;trious, unle&s;s it be tho&s;e who are mi&s;erably poor: the others lay the whole burden of their work on their wives and &s;laves, whether it be tilling the ground, &s;pinning of cotton, weaving of cloth, or any other handicraft; whil&s;t they, if they have but the lea&s;t &s;tock, apply them&s;elves to merchandize alone.</P>
<P>There are three per&s;ons here, called great lords or great men, who have the whole management of affairs under the king, and are always near his per|&s;on. If a woman is delivered of a boy, he is pre|&s;ented to the king, as properly and of right be|longing to him; and hence all the males of the land are called the king's &s;laves. About a fort|night after birth, both males and females are cir|cumci&s;ed. The men here marry as many wives as their circum&s;tances will allow them to keep. Men&s;trous women are obliged, while in that condi|tion, to re&s;ide in a &s;eparate hou&s;e; but as &s;oon as that is over, and they have wa&s;hed them&s;elves, they are re&s;tored to their former &s;tate. A &s;on,
<PB N="158" REF="1570">
after his father's death, if he likes any of his wives, be&s;ides his own mother, he takes them home, and u&s;es as his own, e&s;pecially if they have not had children. If a man &s;urprizes his wife in the act with her gallant, he is entitled to all his ef|fects, which he may immediately &s;eize, and enjoy as his own. The king never appears abroad but once a year, on a great fe&s;tival, called the Coral|fea&s;t, which happens in May. The natives, who are merchants and traders, are obliged to carry them&s;elves very cautiou&s;ly; for, if they &s;hould be repre&s;ented to the governors as great dealers, and rich, they would infallibly accu&s;e them of &s;ome crime or other, in order to get po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their ef|fects. As to religion, they believe there is a God; the efficient cau&s;e of all things; yet are guilty of gro&s;s idolatry. Their &s;abbath happens every fifth day, when the great &s;acrifice cows, &s;heep, and goats; whil&s;t the commonalty offer dogs, cats, and chickens, or whatever their money will reach to.</P>
<P>Benin, which gives name to the empire, and is the king's re&s;idence, is &s;ituated on the river For|mo&s;a, about &s;ixty miles from its mouth. Mar|kets are continually kept in this city for cat|tle, cotton, elephants teeth, and European wares. The inhabitants are all natives, foreigners not being permitted to live in it. The principal in|habitants do not concern them&s;elves in trade, but leave all to their wives, who go to all the circum|jacent villages, to trade in all &s;orts of merchandizes, and are obliged to bring the greate&s;t part of their gains to their hu&s;bands. All the male-&s;laves here are foreigners; for the inhabitants cannot be &s;old for &s;laves, and only bear the name of the king's &s;laves: nor is it allowed to export any male-&s;laves that are &s;old in this country, but females may be dealt with according to every one's plea&s;ure.</P>

About fifty miles from the mouth of the For|mo&s;a &s;tands Areba, a common trading place for the Europeans. Here the Dutch have a factory.</P>
<P>On an i&s;land in the middle of the Formo&s;a, and not far from its mouth &s;tands Agatton, a place of &s;ome trade, &s;everal con&s;iderable fairs or markets be|ing held in it.</P>
<P>About twenty miles from Benin, to the &s;outh, &s;tands Awerri, the capital of a kingdom of the &s;ame name, who&s;e king is independent of that of Benin.</P>
<P>In the Gulph of Benin lie &s;everal i&s;lands, one of which, called the Prince's I&s;le, is held by the Por|tugue&s;e, who have a &s;trong fort on it. It yields them va&s;t quantities of provi&s;ions, with which they victual their &s;hips, and al&s;o &s;upply foreigners. There are &s;everal other large rivers that fall into the Bite or Gulph of Benin or Guinea, be&s;ides Formo|&s;a. At Cape Formo&s;a, the trade con&s;i&s;ts in ele|phants teeth, wax, and honey.</P>

<HEAD>LOWER-GUINEA.</HEAD>
<P>Lower-Guinea, or Congo, has Upper-Guinea, or the kingdom of Benin, on the north; the Ethi|opic Ocean on the we&s;t; the kingdom of Mata|man, and part of Caffraria, on the &s;outh; but its boundaries ea&s;t, and north-ea&s;t, are not yet a&s;cer|tained. Along the coa&s;t, it extends from Capo Lopo, in the fir&s;t degree of &s;outh latitude, to Cape Negro, in about the middle of the &s;even|teenth degree of the &s;ame latitude, that is, about nine hundred and ninety Engli&s;h miles.</P>
<P>This large country is watered with many rivers, and would be very fruitful, if better cultivated; but nothing can conquer the lazine&s;s of the ne|groes, who, for the mo&s;t part, chu&s;e rather to live in want, than give them&s;elves the trouble to get a
<PB N="160" REF="1590">
comfortable livelihood. The mountains abound with the mo&s;t precious metals, as gold, &s;ilver, and copper; but none but the iron mines are wrought, and that chiefly for the &s;ake of arms. The &s;outhern coa&s;ts of Congo, Angola, &amp;c. are under the domi|nion of the Portugue&s;e: no other nation has &s;et|tlements there; but other Europeans are &s;uffered to traffic with that part of the coa&s;t for negroes.</P>
<P>Lower-Guinea, or Congo, is commonly divided into Loango, Congo-Proper, Angola, and Ben|guela.</P>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>LOANGO.</HEAD>
<P>Loango is the mo&s;t northern part of Congo in general, having Benin on the north; Makoko on the ea&s;t; Congo-Proper on the &s;outh; and the Ethiopic Ocean on the we&s;t.</P>
<P>The inhabitants are very black, well-&s;haped, and of a mild temper. The men wear long petticoats, from the wai&s;t downwards, and have round their wai&s;t a piece of cloth, half an ell or a quarter broad, over which they wear the &s;kin of a leopard, or &s;ome other wild bea&s;t, hanging before them like an apron. On their head they wear a cap made of gra&s;s, and quilted, with a feather a-top of it; and on their &s;houlder, or in their hand, they carry a buffaloes tail, to drive away the mu&s;kettos. The women's petticoats are made only of &s;traw, about an ell &s;quare, with which they cover their privities, but leave the greate&s;t part of their thighs and but|tocks bare: the re&s;t of their body is quite bare, except that on their legs they wear little &s;trings of beads made of &s;hells, and &s;mall bracelets of ivory on their arms. They anoint them&s;elves with palm-oil, mixed with a kind of red wood, re|duced to powder.</P>
<P>This country abounds with poultry, oxen, cows, &s;heep, goats, elephants, tigers, leopards, civet-cats,
<PB N="161" REF="1600">
and other animals; &s;o that here are great quantities of elephants teeth, and fine furs to be traded for.</P>
<P>The capital city, where the king re&s;ides, is cal|led Loango or Banza-Loangeri, and in the lan|guage of the negroes, Boaric. This city is &s;itu|ated in 4&deg; and a half, &s;outh lat. a league and a half from the &s;ea coa&s;t. It is a pretty large city, &s;haded and adorned with bananas, palm, and other trees. The king, who re&s;ides in a large palace in the middle of it, has about one thou&s;and five hundred concubines. If any of them is &s;urpri&s;ed in adultery, &s;he and her paramour are in&s;tantly conveyed to the top of a very high hill, whence they are hurled down headlong from the &s;leepe&s;t place.</P>
<P>Every man marries as many wives here as he plea&s;es, who are obliged to get their hu&s;bands livelihood, as is the practice all along the African coa&s;t inhabited by blacks. The women therefore cultivate the land, &s;ow and reap, while the lazy hu&s;bands loiter away their time in idlene&s;s.</P>
<P>The king's revenue con&s;i&s;ts in elephants teeth, copper, and a kind of petticoats made of palm|tree leaves, and called lavogus: he has whole &s;tore hou&s;es full of the&s;e lavogus; but his greate&s;t riches con&s;i&s;t in &s;laves of both &s;exes.</P>
<P>On every fe&s;tival the king appears in public in the large &s;quare before his palace, where the great men of the kingdom dance and caper be|fore him, to do him honour. The moment they come to the entrance of the &s;quare, they pro&s;|trate them&s;elves on the ground, and then ri&s;ing again, they advance dancing towards the king, and being near his per&s;on, &s;it down on the ground.</P>
<P><PB N="162" REF="1610">
Chri&s;tianity, or rather popery, had once made a great progre&s;s in this kingdom; but what the &s;tate thereof is at pre&s;ent we cannot pretend to &s;ay.</P>
<P>To the we&s;t of Loango lies the kingdom of An|zico, and the country of the Jagas or Jagos, the in|habitants of which, if we will credit Dapper, are man-eaters; and human fle&s;h is &s;old in their &s;ham|bles, in&s;tead of beef and mutton.</P>
<P>Congo-Proper is bounded on the north by the river Zaire; on the ea&s;t by a ridge of mountains, and the kingdom of Matamba; on the &s;outh by Angola, from which it is parted by the river Dande; and on the we&s;t by the Ethiopic or Atlantic Ocean. Its extent along the &s;ea-coa&s;t, from the mouth of the river Zaire to Cape Dande, is about &s;ixty leagues; but how far it reaches to the ea&s;tward, &s;eems not to be well a&s;certained.</P>
<P>It is watered by &s;everal rivers, the chief of which is the Zaire above mentioned, otherwi&s;e called the Great River of Congo. This river is very large, but not navigable above twenty or twenty-five miles up, by rea&s;on of the rocks and falls in it. The produce of the country is much the &s;ame as that of Loango. The revenues of the king ari&s;e from the tribute paid by the lords of the &s;everal provinces, who are his va&s;&s;als; and con&s;i&s;t in &s;im|bes or little &s;hells, which &s;erve in&s;tead of money, both here and in &s;everal other parts of Africa, mil|let, and cattle. Some of the va&s;&s;als are &s;o generous as to make the king a pre&s;ent of a couple of goats, be&s;ides the tribute-money; but others give him only &s;ome fruit, or a little palm-wine, nuts, and oil.</P>
<P>Before the Portugue&s;e came into this country, the people were immer&s;ed in the gro&s;&s;e&s;t idolatry. They wor&s;hipped &s;nakes, goats, tigers, and other wild bea&s;ts, imagining, that the homage they paid them would hinder them from doing them any harm. Birds, plants, and trees, and even &s;kins of animals,
<PB N="163" REF="1620">
&s;tuffed with &s;traw, were objects of their wor&s;hip: but though mo&s;t of the negroes here do outwardly profe&s;s and conform to the Roman catholic reli|gion, yet the greate&s;t part of them are &s;till idola|ters in their hearts, and &s;ecretly wor&s;hip their own fal&s;e gods. They who live near churches, and in the &s;ight of the Portugue&s;e, get them&s;elves married by a prie&s;t, but they will not take the trouble to go far for that ble&s;&s;ing; and even they who are mar|ried by a prie&s;t, according to the ceremonies of the church, do not fulfil their engagements, for they take as many concubines as they can maintain.</P>
<P>The principal place in Congo-Proper is Banza Congo, i. e. the Chief Town of Congo, as the na|tives call it; but the Portugue&s;e call it San Sal|vador. The Europeans in this city, it is &s;aid, are above four thou&s;and; and they have introduced into it all &s;orts of arts and trades. Here are neither fleas, mu&s;kettos, nor bugs; but, in&s;tead of them, a va&s;t number of ants, which are very trouble&s;ome.</P>
<P>Angola has Congo Proper on the north; Ma|lemba, or Majemba, on the ea&s;t; Benguela on the &s;outh; and the ocean on the we&s;t. Though the Europeans call this country Angola, its true name is Dombo. It is watered by &s;everal rivers, the chief of which are the Dande and the Coan&s;a, and is very fruitful in maiz and millet. The in|habitants differ but little from tho&s;e of Congo in manners, dre&s;s, and religion.</P>
<P>The capital of the kingdom, called Loanda, is &s;eated near the &s;ea-&s;hore, in 8&deg;. 30&prime;. &s;outh latitude, and has a good harbour. It is &s;aid to contain about three thou&s;and hou&s;es belonging to Eu|ropeans, and is the u&s;ual re&s;idence of the Roman catholic bi&s;hop. The Je&s;uits, before their late ex|pul&s;ion from the dominions of Portugal, are &s;aid to have had above twelve thou&s;and &s;laves here. Over again&s;t the town lies a &s;mall i&s;land, on the &s;and of which are gathered tho&s;e &s;hells called &s;im|bis
<PB N="164" REF="1630">
or zimbis, which &s;erve in&s;tead of current coin with negroes. The right of gathering them the king of Portugal has re&s;erved to him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Benguela has Angola on the north; the coun|try of Jaga Ca&s;anji on the ea&s;t; the kingdom of Mutapan on the &s;outh; and the ocean on the we&s;t. The coa&s;t begins near the mouth of the river Coan|&s;a, or at Cape Ledo, and extends to Cape Negro, about four hundred and thirty miles. The coun|try in general is exceeding fruitful, yielding maiz and millet, with orange, lemon, banana, and other trees, black cattle, hogs, iron, &amp;c. The Por|tugue&s;e have &s;ettlements at Old Benguela, Maniki|congo, and other places.</P>
<P>To what hath been already &s;aid in relation to the African trade, in our de&s;cription of England and el&s;ewhere, we &s;hall here only add a few general ob|&s;ervations, for the farther information and gratifi|cation of our readers.</P>
<P>In 1730 the African company, as they were nei|ther obliged nor in a condition to maintain the &s;orts and ca&s;tles at their own &s;ole co&s;t and charge, the trade being then free and open, petitioned the par|liament, and obtained for that purpo&s;e ten thou&s;and pounds. This &s;um was annually continued to them, except for two or three years, till 1751, when an act was made, in con&s;equence of which the company cea&s;ed to be a corporation after the tenth of April 1752, and their &s;orts, ca&s;tles, and all their other po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions in Africa, were ve&s;ted in a new company of merchants; but the trade, by virtue of this act, and that of the twenty-third of George II. being laid open to all his maje&s;ty's &s;ubjects, the parliament allow this company ten thou&s;and pounds per annum for the &s;upport of the forts and ca&s;tles for the public &s;ervice.</P>

<P>The returns, as the reader mu&s;t have ob&s;erved from our de&s;cription, con&s;i&s;t but of three capital articles, viz. &s;laves, ivory, and gold. This com|merce was formerly much more advantageous than it is now; for the&s;e commodities were then pur|cha&s;ed not only at low rates, but tho&s;e rates were paid in trifles and toys, &s;uch as knives, &s;ci&s;&s;ars, kettles, gla&s;s beads, and cawries; but the traders and adventurers, by their &s;trife, envy, and folly, by endeavouring to &s;upplant one another, by under-&s;elling and over-bidding, have taught the negroes the value of their own goods, and the cheapne&s;s of ours, and thereby to &s;upplant
<PB N="166" REF="1650">
both, by holding up the price of their own produc|tions, and running down tho&s;e which we carry them for &s;ale. Thus that gainful commerce, once &s;uperior to all others, as carrying out the meane&s;t of all articles, and bringing home the riche&s;t, has been long upon the decline; &s;o that we have been &s;aid to buy, even the gold, &s;ometimes too dear. But all this while there is not the lea&s;t u&s;e made of the land; the fruitful &s;oil remains wa&s;te and uncultivated, a va&s;t extended country, plea&s;ant vallies, the banks of charming rivers, &s;pacious plains, capable of im|provement and cultivation to infinite advantage, remain barren and untouched. The late peace, and the ce&s;&s;ion of Senegal, with &s;ome prior regula|tions, it is to be hoped, will have a happy effect in recovering, improving, and extending the African trade.</P>
<P>As the Portugue&s;e are ma&s;ters of &s;uch exten&s;ive territories in Africa, (for they are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the we&s;t coa&s;t as well as of the ea&s;tern, from the tro|pic of Capricorn to the equator, and three or four degrees farther north, and have a multitude of lit|tle African princes under their dominion, who&s;e &s;ubjects they furni&s;h with the woollen manufactures of Great-Britain, having made pro&s;elytes of many of them, and taught them to cloath them&s;elves as the Europeans do) they export more &s;laves from thence to America than any other nation. The Engli&s;h, French, and Dutch al&s;o export a great many; but the Spaniards, who are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the be&s;t part of America, and want &s;laves mo&s;t, have no &s;ettlement on the Negro or Guinea Coa&s;t, but are forced to contract with &s;ome other European nation to furni&s;h them with negroes, which bu&s;i|ne&s;s was performed, for a &s;hort time, by the South-Sea company; but the French, if we are not mi&s;|taken, have the chief benefit of it at pre&s;ent.</P>
<P><PB N="167" REF="1660">
Some imagine, that the gold mines of Africa are in the power of the Europeans, but in this they are mi&s;taken; no Europeans have acce&s;s to the mines of Africa, and few have ever &s;een any, though we have it upon the be&s;t authority, that &s;ome parts of the coa&s;t, as well as the interior country, afford mines, if the negroes would permit them to be open|ed. The negroes e&s;teem their gold mines &s;acred, and of con&s;equence cut off the Europeans from all communication with them; a maxim founded upon true policy and &s;elf-defence, knowing how &s;hort a time they would enjoy them, if once the Europeans got footing. The precious metal is generally found in three different kinds of places. The fir&s;t is in vallies, &s;ituated between mountains: here the negroes, knowing by certain marks where the gold is, dig pits, and &s;eparate it from the ad|hering earth. The &s;econd is in and about rivers and falls of water, which, ru&s;hing down from the mountains, wa&s;h away large quantities of earth, and with it the precious metal. The third method of finding gold is on the &s;ea coa&s;t, and at the mouths of rivers and rivulets, as at Axim: no &s;ooner a heavy &s;hower of rain falls, than tho&s;e places are vi&s;ited by hundreds of negroe women naked: each of the&s;e is furni&s;hed with a &s;mall tray, which they fill with earth, and wa&s;h repeatedly, till the gold is freed from the earth, and falls, by its &s;pecific weight, to the bottom. Some, in a whole day, may perhaps not find &s;ixpence worth, while others are &s;o &s;ucce&s;sful as to make pounds. The gold thus dug or found is of two &s;orts: the one is called gold|du&s;t, which is as fine as flour, and mo&s;t valued, both in Africa and Europe; the other kind con&s;i&s;ts of pieces of different &s;izes, &s;ome weighing not two|pence, others perhaps thirty guineas; but the&s;e la&s;t are &s;carce: however the negroes affirm, that, in the inland countries, pieces weighing two hun|dred
<PB N="168" REF="1670">
are found. The&s;e &s;olid lumps are called mountain-gold, and, when melted, touch better than the du&s;t if pure, which it &s;eldom is.</P>
<P>The negroes have a variety of methods to &s;o|phi&s;ticate the precious metal. One is ca&s;ting it in|to pieces of different forms, called fitiches, mixed with a half, or a third part, of &s;ilver and copper: the&s;e fitiches are cut into &s;mall bits by the negroes, to the value of three farthings each, which &s;erves for the current coin of the country. Another me|thod of adulteration is by ca&s;ting pieces of gold in &s;uch a manner that the external cru&s;t, about a line thick, &s;hall be pure, while the in&s;ide con&s;i&s;ts wholly of copper, perhaps of iron. Another method, which they &s;ometimes practi&s;e to deceive Europeans, is by a powder of coral or copper filings, tinged &s;o exactly like gold that only &s;cales can di&s;cover the cheat.</P>
<P>There are a &s;ort of red and white beans u&s;ed as currency on the Gold-Coa&s;t. Of the red beans, &s;potted with black, called danbays, each is equal to a Dutch &s;tiver. The white beans, with black &s;pots, called jacoes, pa&s;s often for four &s;tivers; but they are le&s;s current than the others. In Bo&s;|man's time, the Europeans carried off from the Gold-Coa&s;t about twenty-three tons of gold in a year, or two hundred and thirty thou&s;and pounds, allowing three marks, or twenty-four ounces, to an hundred. Of this the Engli&s;h African company ex|ported twelve hundred marks, and the Engli&s;h in|terlopers a thou&s;and, and &s;ometimes two thou&s;and.</P>
<P>The Portugue&s;e were the fir&s;t Europeans that di&s;covered the &s;outh-we&s;t coa&s;t of Africa, in the fif|teenth century, and obtained a grant from the pope in 1442, of all countries di&s;covered, or to be di&s;co|vered, to the &s;outh and ea&s;t of Cape Bajadore, which lies on the we&s;t &s;ide of Africa, in twenty-&s;e|ven degrees, odd minutes, of north latitude: where|upon

the Portugue&s;e built forts, and &s;ettled colonies upon the we&s;tern coa&s;t of Africa, and enjoyed the &s;ole trade thither, and to the Ea&s;t-Indies, for upwards of an hundred years; but the Engli&s;h and Dutch, and other prote&s;tant powers, calling in que&s;tion the pope's authority to di&s;po&s;e of all Pagan countries, in the &s;ixteenth century &s;ent their fleets to the coa&s;t of Guinea, and erected forts there. The Dutch, in particular, made them&s;elves ma&s;ters of the fort of St. George del Mina, the capital of all the Portu|gue&s;e &s;ettlements on that coa&s;t, and at length drove them entirely from the coa&s;t of Proper-Guinea.

<HEAD>NIGRITIA, or NEGROLAND.</HEAD>
<P>Nigritia, or Negroland, the next country to Guinea towards the north, lies between 18&deg;. of we&s;t and 150&deg;. of ea&s;t longitude, and between 10 and 20&deg;. of north latitude, the great river Ni|ger running through it from ea&s;t to we&s;t. It is bounded by Zaara, or the De&s;ert, on the north; by unknown countries on the ea&s;t; by Guinea on the &s;outh; and by the Atlantic Ocean on the we&s;t. The Europeans have &s;everal &s;ettlements on the branches of the rivers Niger or Sanaga, and Gambia, e&s;pe|cially near their mouths. A great many different nations inhabit the banks of the rivers; &s;ome Pa|gans, &s;ome Mohammedans, of different languages, and independent of one another. The country is fruitful, e&s;pecially along the rivers, abounding in rice, Guinea grain, and Indian corn, where it is cultivated; and with cocoa-nuts, plantains, pul&s;e,
<PB N="170" REF="1690">
palm trees, and tropical fruits; nor is it de&s;titute of cattle, and a variety of other animals, particu|larly &s;uch as are found in Guinea.</P>
<P>The river Sanaga is thought to be the &s;ame with that called by antient geographers the Niger; but it hath not yet been determined whether the Gam|bia be a di&s;tinct river, or only a branch of the Ni|ger. As far as Europeans have been able to trace them hitherto, they appear to be different rivers. According to the information of the Mandingo ne|groes, who, among all the blacks, are the mo&s;t ad|dicted to travelling and traffic, the former has its &s;ource from the lake Maberia, in the kingdom of Tombut, which is little more than half way to that of the Nile; but the informations of the&s;e negroes with re&s;pect to it cannot be depended upon, nei|ther have they gone far enough back to be certain as to its real &s;ource. Thus much however is cer|tain, that the Niger or Sanaga is a very large ri|ver, and of great extent, e&s;pecially if we &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e, according to the opinion of the be&s;t mo|dern geographers, that it has its &s;ource in the kingdom of Gorhan, not far from the confines of Upper-Ethiopia; for then it will cro&s;s almo&s;t the whole country of Africa, where it is wide&s;t. As the Europeans call it Niger, the natives call it Wed, or Huid Nijar, i. e. the Black River, or the River of Senegal, and the Arabs the Nile of the Nigritians; this la&s;t nation con&s;idering it as a branch of the Nile, or rather the Nile and the Niger, as two branches of the &s;ame river. The entrance into it is narrow and &s;omewhat difficult, by rea&s;on of its immoveable bar and &s;andy &s;hoals, as well as the &s;everal i&s;lands at the mouth of it, and the &s;everal canals and mar&s;hes that clog it; but, after &s;ailing up eight or ten leagues, it is found broad and deep, and fit to carry large ve&s;&s;els; and, except about five or &s;ix leagues on each &s;ide, above
<PB N="17$" REF="1700">
the mouth, which is &s;andy and barren ground, in all the re&s;t, as far as the lake Maberia, the banks are covered with &s;tately fruit-trees and villages, and the country, in general, well watered and ve|ry fertile; for, like the Nile, it overflows for many leagues, and enriches the land to a great de|gree; though the inhabitants, for want of &s;kill and indu&s;try, do not reap all the advantages that they otherwi&s;e might. The people however, on both &s;ides, live as near as they can to it, and feed great herds of cattle, and &s;ow large and &s;mall millet, the former of which we call Turky wheat, in great quantities, and with great increa&s;e. Upon the banks of the river, in the kingdom of Fulis, and near a lake called by the French Panier Fouli, is a large fore&s;t of fine ebony, great quantities of which are cut down, and carried off in floats down the river, and &s;old very cheap. If the river fails of overflowing at its u&s;ual &s;ea&s;on, a great &s;carcity, if not a downright famine, never fails to en&s;ue in the adjacent country; and even when it overflows re|gularly, it breeds &s;uch va&s;t flights of gra&s;hoppers and in&s;ects as quite darken the air, and frequently eat up all the product of the earth, in which ca&s;e, the only remedy the people have is to kill tho&s;e in|&s;ects, and eat them, which they do either by pound|ing them in leathern bags, and boiling them with milk, or, which is reckoned the more delicious way, by frying or broiling them over a light blaze, in a frying-pan full of holes, through which the fire burns their wings and legs, and leaves the re&s;t of the body &s;ufficiently roa&s;ted to be eaten as a dainty, which they look upon as very whole&s;ome and nou|ri&s;hing.</P>
<P>As the Niger receives many con&s;iderable rivers in its cour&s;e, which &s;well it high enough to be able at all times to carry ve&s;&s;els of good burthen, &s;o it &s;plits it&s;elf into &s;everal branches, which uniting
<PB N="172" REF="1710">
again, form very large and fertile i&s;lands, well filled with towns, villages, and inhabitants. It pa&s;&s;es al&s;o through &s;everal lakes, and over divers cataracts. After having run from ea&s;t to we&s;t, during a prodigious long cour&s;e, it turns at la&s;t &s;hort to the &s;outh, at a league and a half di&s;tance from the We&s;tern Ocean, leaving but a very nar|row tract between it and the &s;ea, into which it opens its way in lat. 15&deg; 55&prime;. after having run about twenty-five leagues from north to &s;outh. Its mouth is &s;ometimes half a league broad; but is &s;hut up, as we ob&s;erved above, by a bank of quick&s;and, called the bar of Senegal, where the water is &s;o &s;hallow, that it is very difficult and dangerous to pa&s;s over it. The bar is formed by the mud and &s;and which the river brings with it, during the inundation, and which the &s;ea continually drives back upon the &s;hore. This would effectually exclude all &s;hipping, had not the violence of the current, and the weight of the waters, made two openings or channels, which are called the pa&s;&s;es of the bar. The large&s;t is commonly not above one hundred and fifty or two hundred fathoms broad, and about ten feet deep, &s;o that none but barks of forty or fifty tons can get through this channel. The other is &s;o narrow and &s;hallow, that it is pa&s;&s;able for canoes only. The&s;e channeis are not always in the &s;ame place; for the river, as it is more or le&s;s &s;welled, and its current more or le&s;s rapid, opens tho&s;e pa&s;&s;es &s;ometimes in one place, and &s;ometimes in another. The bar it&s;elf al&s;o often &s;hifts its place, &s;o that the i&s;land of Sanaga, or Senegal, is at one time four leagues di&s;tant from it, and at another no more than two. It is this bar only which hinders &s;hips of four or five hundred tons to go up the river.</P>
<P>Among other I&s;lands in the river, is that of Sa|naga, or Senegal, which is now po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the
<PB N="173" REF="1720">
Engli&s;h, having been taken from the French during the late war. It lies about fifteen miles from the mouth of the river, being about one mile and a quarter in length from north to &s;outh, and almo&s;t half a mile broad from ea&s;t to we&s;t. The &s;oil is compo&s;ed of a bed of loo&s;e &s;and, productive of nothing but what is forced by art and the riche&s;t manure: notwith&s;tanding which it contains three thou&s;and inhabitants, who&s;e principal food is fi&s;h and maiz. This &s;ort of corn grows in great plenty almo&s;t all over the country. The river on the ea&s;t &s;ide is &s;aid to be three hundred and eighty fathoms broad in the dry &s;ea&s;on, and on the we&s;t two hundred and ten. The water of the wells that are dug here is always bracki&s;h, and &s;o is that of the river in the dry &s;ea&s;on; but when it is &s;welled by the rains, the water is &s;weet and whole|&s;ome.</P>
<P>To the north-ea&s;t, ea&s;t, and &s;outh-ea&s;t of this i&s;land, the country, as far as it is known, is over|run with woods and mar&s;hes; the Sanaga, Gam|bia, and Sherbro, which by &s;ome are looked upon as branches of the &s;ame river, pa&s;&s;ing through it in their way to the Atlantic ocean. During the rainy months, which begin in July, and continue to October, they lay the whole country under water; and, indeed, the very &s;udden ri&s;e of the&s;e rivers is incredible to tho&s;e who have never been within the tropics, and are unacquainted with the violent rains that fall there. At Galam, nine hun|dred miles from the mouth of the Sanaga, the waters ri&s;e one hundred and fifty feet perpendicular from the bed of the river. At the i&s;land of Sene|gal, the river ri&s;es gradually, during the rainy &s;ea|&s;on, above twenty feet perpendicular over part of that flat coa&s;t, which of it&s;elf &s;o fre&s;hens the water, that &s;hips lying at anchor at the di&s;tance of three leagues from its mouth, generally make u&s;e of it,
<PB N="174" REF="1730">
and fill their water there for their voyage home. When the rains are at an end, which u&s;ually hap|pens in October, the inten&s;e heat of the &s;un &s;oon dries up tho&s;e waters, which lie on the higher parts, and the remainder forms lakes of &s;tagnated waters, in which are found all &s;orts of dead animals. The&s;e waters every day decrea&s;e, till at la&s;t they are quite exhaled, and then the effluvia that ari&s;e are almo&s;t un&s;upportable. At this &s;ea&s;on the winds blow &s;o very hot from off the land, that they may well be compared to the heat proceeding from the mouth of an oven, and they bring with them a &s;mell that is quite intolerable. Their ef|fects upon wolves, tigers, lions, and other wild bea&s;ts, are &s;uch, that they are &s;een to re&s;ort to the river, keeping their body under water, and only their &s;nout above it, for the &s;ake of breathing. The birds likewi&s;e are &s;een to &s;oar to an immen&s;e height, and to fly a va&s;t way over the &s;ea, where they continue till the wind changes, and comes from the we&s;t. It may &s;eem &s;urprizing, that a part of the world &s;o unwhole&s;ome as this &s;hould yet be &s;o populous; but the wonder will cea&s;e when it is known, that the greate&s;t pride among the men con&s;i&s;ts in the number of their wives, &s;o that every one takes as many as he can maintain; &s;ome &s;ix, others eight, and others, twelve at a time.</P>
<P>One of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable articles of com|merce, and the chief inducement to Europeans for &s;ettling here, is the gum Senega, &s;o denominated from the river; the fore&s;ts on the banks thereof abounding with this gum, which pretty much re|&s;embles the gum Arabic. Dyers, and other arti|ficers, con&s;ume the greate&s;t quantities of it. The French, before the late war, when they were in po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of this part of the African coa&s;t, from Cape Blanco to the river Gambia, about four hun|dred miles in extent, engro&s;&s;ed this valuable trade
<PB N="175" REF="1740">
wholly to them&s;elves. Hence it is, that this coa&s;t, notwith&s;tanding its unhealthine&s;s, and roads &s;o dangerous for &s;hipping, hath neverthele&s;s been eagerly contended for by the Engli&s;h, French, Dutch, and Portugue&s;e. All &s;trove to &s;ettle here in their turns, that by being ma&s;ters of the Se|negal rivers, they might be al&s;o ma&s;ters of the gum trade; a trade, which &s;eems a light matter in it&s;elf, but is, in effect, very con&s;iderable, whe|ther we regard the price the natives &s;ell the gum for, which is very moderate; the great demand for it, and its u&s;efulne&s;s; or, la&s;tly, the quantity of European merchandizes it takes off ready wrought; the vent of which makes manufactures &s;pread, money circulate, and &s;o finds work for abundance of hands, which is the main end of commerce.</P>
<P>The mouth of the river Gambia lies in 13&deg;. 20&prime;. north latitude, and in 16&deg;. of longitude we&s;t of London. It is formed on the north &s;ide by Bar|rah Point, and on the &s;outh by Banion Point, being about four miles over. This river, as we ob&s;erved al|ready, is generally &s;uppo&s;ed to be a branch of the Niger; for the Mundingo negroes affirm, that the Niger, having run from its &s;pring to a place called Baracota, divides it&s;elf there into two branches; one of which, running &s;outhward, is called Gam|bia, which, after a pretty long cour&s;e, lo&s;es or &s;eems to lo&s;e it&s;elf, in a mar&s;hy lake, full of weeds and reeds, &s;o thick and &s;trong that it is impa&s;&s;able; af|terwards, coming out of that lake, it appears again a fine deep river, &s;uch as it is &s;een at Bar&agrave;canda, whither the Europeans go to trade with the Mun|dingo merchants.</P>
<P>The Engli&s;h, Portugue&s;e, and French, have &s;et|tlements on this river. The principal Engli&s;h &s;et|tlement is in a &s;mall i&s;land, called James's I&s;land, which lies about ten miles from the rivers,
<PB N="176" REF="1750">
mouth, where it is at lea&s;t &s;even miles wide. There is al&s;o a con&s;iderable factory at Gyllifree, a large town on the north bank of the river, near James's I&s;land; and another higher up the river at Joar, in the kingdom of Bar&s;ally. The chief &s;et|tlement of the French is at Albedra, between the river's mouth and James's Fort.</P>
<P>The &s;ides of the river Gambia are, for the mo&s;t part, flat and woody, for about a quarter of a mile inland; and within that are plea&s;ant open grounds, which they u&s;e for their rice, and, in the dry &s;ea|&s;on, &s;erve the cattle for pa&s;ture. The country more inland is generally very woody; but near the towns there is always a large &s;pace of clear ground for corn. The &s;oil is mo&s;tly &s;and, with &s;ome clay, and a great deal of rocky ground. Near the &s;ea, and the lower part of the river, no hills are to be &s;een; but high up the river are &s;ome lofty moun|tains. The property of all the palm and cocoa-trees are ve&s;ted in the petty kings; in&s;omuch that no one dare cut any leaves, or draw any wine from them, without their previous knowledge or con&s;ent. The ciboa-tree is very much like the palm-tree, and grows to a great height: the leaves which grow on the top are very u&s;eful for covering of hou&s;es, and the natives extract wine out of it exactly in the &s;ame way as out of the palm-tree.</P>
<P>The languages generally &s;poken along the Gam|bia are the Mundingo, a ba&s;tard &s;ort of Portugue&s;e, and the Arabic: the &s;econd is chiefly u&s;ed by the Europeans, and the la&s;t by the Pholeys, and mo&s;t of the Mohammedan tribes.</P>
<P>The chief trade here is in gold, &s;laves, elephants teeth, and bees-wax. The gold is of a very good quality, and finer than &s;terling gold. The &s;laves are either pri&s;oners taken in war, or per&s;ons condemned for crimes, or &s;tolen. Stealing is very common here; and, &s;ince the &s;lave trade has been u&s;ed, all puni&s;h|ments
<PB N="177" REF="1760">
are changed into &s;lavery. The Engli&s;h ne|ver buy any per&s;on that they &s;u&s;pect has been &s;to|len, without &s;ending for the chief men of the place, and con&s;ulting with them about the matter. Ivo|ry or elephants teeth, by the natives called mor|phel, is got either by hunting and killing the bea&s;ts, or picked up in the woods: whoever kills an elephant has liberty to &s;ell him, and his teeth. The larger the teeth, the more valuable the ivory. Some of them are white, others yellow; but the difference of colour makes no difference of price. A great deal of bees-wax is made and &s;old about the river: that which is cleare&s;t from dirt is be&s;t. It is tried by boring through the cakes, which are from twenty to an hundred and twenty pounds weight. Some gum-dragon is al&s;o brought from this country, which comes from a tree called pau de &s;angue, or blood-wood. Upon wounding this tree, drops like blood ooze out of it, which run into lumps, and are dried in the &s;un.</P>
<P>Between thirty and forty leagues to the &s;outh of Senegal river lies Cape Verd, or the Green Cape, &s;o called from the va&s;t number of trees upon it, which are always green; whereas mo&s;t of the other capes are dry, &s;andy, and barren. It is the mo&s;t we&s;tern point of Africa: the i&s;lands in the Atlan|tic Ocean, to which it gives name, lie upwards of three hundred miles from it. Not far from the &s;hore here is the i&s;land of Goree, which the Engli&s;h took from the French in the late war, but re&s;tored at the peace. It is &s;mall and barren, without any wood, or water, but what the inhabitants pre|&s;erve in ci&s;terns; but its &s;ituation, harbour, and good anchoring all round, render it very con&s;idera|ble for tho&s;e nations that have any &s;ettlements on that part of the African coa&s;t.</P>
<P>Among the nations inhabiting Negroland, the mo&s;t con&s;iderable, of tho&s;e at lea&s;t that are known
<PB N="178" REF="1770">
to the Europeans, are the Floops, Pholeys, Jol|lifs, and Mundingoes. The la&s;t are &s;aid to exceed all the other negroes in wit, civility, and indu&s;try; and next to the&s;e are the Pholeys: both the&s;e na|tions are Mohammedans.</P>
<P>Before we clo&s;e our account of this part of Africa, it will not be ami&s;s to take notice of a tree of a new genus which grows in Senegal, and may ju&s;tly be accounted the large&s;t vegetable in nature. The real name of this tree is baobab; the Jolliffs, or Oualoffs, natives of the country, call it goui, and its fruit boui; but the French call it calaba&s;&s;ier or the calaba&s;h-tree, and the fruit pain de &s;inge, or monkey's bread. The baobab will not grow but in a very hot climate: it delights in a &s;andy and moi&s;t &s;oil, e&s;pecially if this &s;oil is free from &s;tones, that might hurt its roots; for the lea&s;t &s;cratch they re|ceive is &s;oon followed by a caries, which communi|cates it&s;elf to the trunk of the tree, and infallibly de&s;troys it. The trunk of this &s;ingular tree is not very high, not exceeding twelve or fifteen feet from the roots to the branches; but &s;everal have been &s;een by Europeans &s;eventy-five and &s;eventy-eight feet round, that is, from twenty-five to twenty-&s;even feet in diameter. The fir&s;t branches extend almo&s;t horizontally, and being very thick, and about &s;ix|ty feet in length, their own weight bends down their extremities to the ground; the centre branches ri&s;e perpendicularly, but &s;o as to make a &s;heling; and the tree, being thus regularly rounded, its trunk is ab&s;olutely hidden, and it appears as an hemi&s;pherical ma&s;s of verdure, of about an hundred and twenty, an hundred and thirty, or an hundred and forty feet in diameter.</P>
<P>The roots of the baobab are an&s;werable to its &s;ize in all re&s;pects; and to the branches above there is a corre&s;pondent number of radical branches be|low. The leaves are about five inches long, and
<PB N="179" REF="1780">
two broad, and pointed at both extremities. They adhere three, five, or &s;even, but mo&s;t commonly &s;even, in the manner of a fan, on a common pedi|cle, much like tho&s;e of the che&s;nut tree. After the falling of the petals and &s;tamina, the ovary, as it ripens, becomes an oblong fruit, pointed at both extremities, fifteen or eighteen feet long, and five or &s;ix broad. The &s;eed is of a &s;hining brown co|lour, nearly of the figure of a kidney-bean, five lines in length, and three in breadth, and the pulp that &s;urrounds them is ea&s;ily reduced to a powder, brought hither from the Levant, and known, for a long time, by the very improper name of terra lemnia; being &s;old by the Mandingoes to the Arabs, and by them di&s;tributed through all the Levant.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the caries mentioned above, this tree is &s;ubject to a kind of mouldine&s;s, that gets into the whole ligneous body, and without changing the texture of its fibres, &s;oftens it &s;o, that it has no more con&s;i&s;tence than the ordinary pith of trees, and is ea&s;ily overturned by a moderate bla&s;t of wind.</P>
<P>The real country of the baobab is Africa, and particularly the we&s;tern coa&s;t of that part which extends from the Niger to the kingdom of Benin. The growth of it is very rapid in the fir&s;t years &s;uc|ceeding its birth, but dimini&s;hes afterwards very con&s;iderably; and, though the proportion of this diminution is not certainly known, it is certain, that the latter growth of the baobab proceeds with an extreme &s;lowne&s;s; and that &s;uch of tho&s;e trees as have arrived at the above-mentioned bulk, might have fir&s;t appeared out of the earth not long after the Univer&s;al Deluge. The baobab, as all other plants of the malvaceous tribe, has an emollient virtue, capable of maintaining in the body an abun|dant tran&s;piration, and of oppo&s;ing the too great heat of the blood: hence its leaves, either reduced to powder, or by way of decoction, are found of
<PB N="180" REF="1790">
great efficacy in pre&s;erving from or mitigating the heat of urine, and hot fevers, which often attack foreigners at Senegal, during the month of Sep|tember. The fre&s;h or newly gathered fruit is not le&s;s u&s;eful than its leaves; its pulp is eaten, which is &s;ubacid, and agreeable enough; by mixing its juice with water, and a little &s;ugar, a liquor is made, attended with the be&s;t effects in all hot af|fections, and in putrid or pe&s;tilential fevers; la&s;tly, when the fruit is &s;poiled, the negroes make excel|lent &s;oap of it, by burning it, and mixing its a&s;hes with the oil of the palm-tree, that begins to be rancid.</P>
<P>Another and very &s;ingular u&s;e is made of the trunk of this tree by the natives. As the caries, to which it is &s;ubject, often makes it hollow, they en|large tho&s;e cavities, and form a &s;ort of chambers out of them, where they hang the dead bodies of tho&s;e to whom they are unwilling to grant the ho|nour of burial: tho&s;e bodies dry there perfectly, and become real mummies, without any other pre|paration. The greate&s;t number of the bodies &s;o dried is of the Guiriots, who are their jugglers, poets, and mu&s;icians, and have a &s;ort of in&s;pection over fea&s;ts and dances. On account of this kind of &s;uperiority of talents, they are regarded as for|cerers, and mini&s;ters of the devil, and con&s;equently dreaded by the other negroes, who think that their bodies would draw down a malediction upon the earth or water &s;hould that receive them: hence it is, that they hide and dry them in the hollow trunks of the baobab.</P>

<HEAD>ZAARA.</HEAD>
<P>This va&s;t inho&s;pitable region, which is rightly named by the Arabs Sara, Zara, but more proper|ly Zahara, which &s;ignifies a De&s;ert, &s;tretches it&s;elf
<PB N="181" REF="1800">
from the Atlantic Ocean on the we&s;t, to the De&s;ert of Barca and Nubia on the ea&s;t; that is, from the eighth degree of we&s;t to the twenty-&s;ixth of ea&s;t longitude; and from Biledulgerid on the north, to Negroland on the &s;outh; or from the fifteenth de|gree of latitude quite to the tropic of Cancer, and even beyond; &s;o that it will be about four hun|dred or five hundred miles in breadth, from north to &s;outh; and above fifteen hundred in length, from ea&s;t to we&s;t. The river Niger is its boundary to the &s;outh. It was known to the antients by the name of Libya Interior, or Libya De&s;erta; and is &s;uppo&s;ed to have been then inhabited by the Getuli. At pre&s;ent it is mo&s;tly inhabited by Arabs, who, for the generality, are an ignorant, bruti&s;h, and &s;avage people, who lead a wandering life, and live chiefly on the milk of their flocks, with a little barley-meal, and &s;ome dates. The poorer &s;ort go naked, except the females, who commonly wrap a clout about their middle, and wear a kind of bonnet on their head; but the wealthier &s;ort have a kind of loo&s;e gown, made of blue callicoe, with large &s;leeves, that is brought them from Negroland. Both &s;exes are very &s;war|thy; the men tall and thin, but the women fat and lu&s;ty. When they move from one place to ano|ther for fre&s;h pa&s;ture, water, or prey, mo&s;t of them ride on camels, which have generally a &s;ort of &s;addle between the bunch and the neck, with a &s;tring or &s;trap run through their no&s;trils, which &s;erves for a bridle; and, in&s;tead of &s;purs, they u&s;e a &s;harp bodkin. Their tents or huts are covered with a coar&s;e &s;tuff, made of camels hair, and a kind of wool or mo&s;s that grows on the palm trees. The&s;e Arabs live here, under the government of their &s;heiks or cheyks, as in Arabia, Egypt, and other places.</P>

So de&s;titute of water and provi&s;ions is mo&s;t part of this country, that many of the camels which form the caravans that travel from Moroc|co to Guinea, are laden with water and nece&s;&s;aries. It is al&s;o terribly infe&s;ted with &s;corpions, vipers, and other venemous reptiles and in&s;ects, as well as lions, tigers, and &s;uch like fierce animals. At &s;ome particular &s;ea&s;ons, there are &s;een flights of locu&s;ts, which &s;oon devour all the little verdure they have. Be&s;ides the&s;e Arabs, there is a people here, who live in &s;ettled habitations, and are more civil and ho&s;pitable, carrying on a kind of com|merce with &s;trangers. The religion of both is a kind of Mohammedi&s;m. The chief commodi|ties here are their camels and other cattle, their dates, and the fat and feathers of their o&s;triches. Gold-du&s;t al&s;o is &s;aid to be found in &s;ome parts of it. When the water that is carried on the camels backs through the&s;e de&s;erts happens to fail, they commonly kill the camels them&s;elves, and drink the water they find in their &s;tomachs; it being the nature of that animal, whenever he finds a &s;uffi|ciency of that element to drink enough at one time to &s;erve him a whole fortnight.</P>
<P>In the province or de&s;ert of Azaoad are two tombs, with in&s;criptions, importing that the un|happy per&s;ons there interred were, the one a wealthy merchant, and the other a poor carrier, who both died with thir&s;t. The former had given a thou&s;and ducats to the latter for a crui&s;e of water.</P>

<HEAD>BILEDULGERID.</HEAD>
<P>This country hath its name from the Arabic Biled-el-gerid, &s;ignifying the Land of Dates, be|cau&s;e it abounds with that kind of fruit more than any other territory in Africa.</P>
<P><PB N="183" REF="1820">
This country, which was antiently called Nu|midia, is &s;aid to be almo&s;t of a &s;quare form, ex|tending it&s;elf above eighty leagues every way, or from 28&deg;. 30&prime;. to 32&deg;. 50&prime;. of latitude; and from 5&deg;. 30&prime;. to 11&deg;. 50&prime;. of ea&s;t longitude. It is bound|ed on the ea&s;t by a ridge of high mountains, which part it from the kingdom of Tripoli and part of Gadamis; on the &s;outh by Zaara; on the north by the dominions of Tunis; and on the we&s;t by tho&s;e of Algiers.</P>
<P>The whole country of Biledulgerid is very moun|tainous, &s;andy, and barren, except &s;ome parts of it that are quite covered with large thick fore&s;ts of palm-trees, which yield va&s;t quantities of dates. Formerly, however, it was tolerably fruitful, when it was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by an indu&s;trious people; but the Mohammedans, who are now ma&s;ters of it, taking no care to cultivate the &s;oil, it produces little more than Zaara. The climate is hot and unhealthy, and the people lean, and of a &s;warthy and &s;hrivelled complexion. Notwith&s;tanding the plague is &s;o frequent in Barbary, it is &s;aid, it is &s;carcely ever heard of here, any more than the &s;mall-pox. The inhabitants are a mixture of antient Africans and wild Arabs; the former living in a kind of towns and villages, and the latter in tents, rambling from place to place. One of the chief diver&s;ions of the natives is the hunting of o&s;triches, which are &s;aid to be as high here as a man on hor&s;eback: they eat their fle&s;h, barter their feathers for corn and other things they want, u&s;e their fat or oil as a me|dicine, make pendants for their ears of their ta|lons, and turn the &s;kins into knap&s;acks. Be&s;ides the fle&s;h of o&s;triches, and dates, they eat al&s;o the fle&s;h of goats and camels, and drink their milk. Some of them own no &s;uperior, others have their &s;heiks or lords, and others are &s;ubject to, or at lea&s;t

<HEAD>BARBARY.</HEAD>
<P>The va&s;t region included under the name of Barbary, is bounded on the north by the Mediter|ranean Sea, which divides it from Europe; on the ea&s;t by Egypt; on the &s;outh by Zaara, and Bile|dulgerid; and on the we&s;t by the Atlantic or We&s;|tern Ocean. Its utmo&s;t extent from ea&s;t to we&s;t, that is, from cape None, on the mo&s;t we&s;tern coa&s;t of Morocco, to the confines of Egypt, is almo&s;t 37&deg;, that is from 10&deg; of we&s;t, to 26&frac12; of ea&s;t lon|gitude, or about two thou&s;and two hundred miles. As for its breadth from north to &s;outh, it is very unequal, in &s;ome parts not above 6 or 7&deg;; and where wide&s;t, as from Cape None to Tangier, not above 10&deg;; but we mu&s;t ob&s;erve, that mo&s;t geographers have given it a greater extent both ways, by including the creeks and windings.</P>
<P>Barbary is, next to Egypt, the mo&s;t fertile, trad|ing, and populous part of Africa. The &s;oil abounds with plenty and variety of grain and fruits, e&s;pe|cially citrons, oranges, dates, figs, olives, grapes, pomegranates, and almonds, in all which the inha|bitants drive a con&s;iderable trade, as well as in co|ral, Morocco leather, Barbary hor&s;es, and other commodities. The air is healthy though hot, being tempered by con&s;tant breezes from the Mediterranean.</P>
<P>The coa&s;t of Barbary was probably fir&s;t planted by the Egyptians. The Phenicians afterwards &s;ent colonies thither, and built Utica and Carthage. The Carthaginians &s;oon became powerful and wealthy by trade, and finding the country divided into a great many little kingdoms and &s;tates, either &s;ubdued them, or made the princes tributary, who
<PB N="185" REF="1840">
being weary of their yoke, were glad of the op|portunity of a&s;&s;i&s;ting the Romans in &s;ubduing Carthage. The Romans remained &s;overeigns of the coa&s;t of Barbary, till the Vandals, in the fifth century, reduced it under their dominion. The Roman or rather the Grecian emperors hav|ing &s;ome time after recovered the coa&s;t of Bar|bary from the Vandals, it remained under their do|minion, till the Saracen caliphs, the &s;ucce&s;&s;ors of Mahomet, made an entire conque&s;t of all the north of Africa in the &s;eventh century, and divided the country among their chiefs, of whom the &s;ove|reign of Morocco was the mo&s;t con&s;iderable, po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ing the north we&s;t part of the country, which, in the Roman divi&s;ion, obtained the name of Mau|ritania Tingitana, from Tingis or Tangier the ca|pital, and is now &s;tiled the empire of Morocco, comprehending the kingdoms or provinces of Fez and Morocco. The emperors of the&s;e territories are almo&s;t always at war with the Spaniards and Portugue&s;e. In the eighth century their ance&s;tors made a conque&s;t of the greate&s;t part of Spain; but after the lo&s;s of Granada, which happened about the year 1492, they were di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of this country; and Ferdinand and I&s;abella, who were then upon the throne of Spain, obliged them ei|ther to renounce their religion, or tran&s;port them|&s;elves to the coa&s;t of Africa. Tho&s;e who embraced the latter alternative, to revenge them&s;elves on the Spaniards, and &s;upply their nece&s;&s;ities, confederated with the Mohammedan princes on the coa&s;t of Barbary, and having fitted out little fleets of crui&s;|ing ve&s;&s;els, took all the Spani&s;h merchant &s;hips they met with at &s;ea, and being well acquainted with the country, landed in Spain, whence they car|ried off multitudes of Spaniards, and made &s;laves of them. The Spaniards hereupon a&s;&s;embled a fleet of men of war, invaded Barbary, and hav|ing
<PB N="186" REF="1850">
taken Oran, and many other places on the coa&s;t of Algier, were in a fair way of making an entire conque&s;t of the country. In this di&s;tre&s;s the African princes applied to the famous Turki&s;h rover, Barbaro&s;&s;a, de&s;iring his a&s;&s;i&s;tance again&s;t the Chri&s;tians. He readily complied with their reque&s;t, but had no &s;ooner repulled their enemies than he u&s;urped the government of Algiers, and treated the people who called him in as &s;laves; as his brother Heyradin Barbaro&s;&s;a afterwards did the people of Tunis; and a third obtained the govern|ment of Tripoli by the &s;ame means. In the&s;e u&s;ur|pations they were &s;upported by the grand &s;eignor, who claimed the &s;overeignty of the whole coa&s;t, and for &s;ome time they were e&s;teemed the &s;ubjects of Turkey, and governed by Turki&s;h ba&s;has or viceroys; but each of the&s;e &s;tates, or rather the military men, at length took upon them to elect a &s;overeign out of their own body, and rendered them&s;elves independent of the Turki&s;h empire. The grand &s;eignor now has not &s;o much as a ba&s;ha or officer at Algier; but the dey acts as an ab&s;olute prince, and is only liable to be depo&s;ed by the &s;ol|diery that advanced him. Tunis al&s;o and Tripoli have now entirely &s;haken off that dependence, which ever &s;ince the days of the famous Barba|ro&s;&s;a, for above two hundred years, they had on the Turki&s;h empire.</P>
<P>A &s;era&s;kier, who was lately &s;ent by the porte to Algier, to demand twenty years tribute, which was then due, was an&s;wered by the dey, that he was firmly re&s;olved not only to refu&s;e to di&s;charge the arrear, but al&s;o to pay any tribute for the future: that the &s;tate of Algier was ab&s;olutely free and in|dependent of the Porte; that it &s;tood in no need of the Porte's protection; and that he the &s;era&s;kier might return to Con&s;tantinople with that an&s;wer. The &s;era&s;kier was not more fortunate in the execu|tion
<PB N="187" REF="1860">
of his commi&s;&s;ion to the re&s;t of the&s;e &s;tates on whom he had demands of the &s;ame nature, and received an&s;wers from them all nearly to the &s;ame purpo&s;e. We do not find that the Porte took any mea&s;ures in con&s;equence of this refu&s;al, either to inforce the demand, or to re&s;ent the contempt &s;hewn to its authority, though it was then at peace with all its neighbours.</P>
<P>The&s;e &s;tates &s;till continue to plunder and harra&s;s the Spaniards, having never been at peace with them &s;ince the lo&s;s of Granada. They make prizes al&s;o of all other Chri&s;tian &s;hips, that have Spani&s;h goods or pa&s;&s;engers on board, and even tho&s;e that have not, unle&s;s they have purcha&s;ed peace of them. The Turks of Algiers, Tunis, and Tripoli, are an abandoned race, con&s;i&s;ting of pirates, banditti, and the very refu&s;e of Turkey, who have been forced to leave their &s;everal countries, to avoid the puni&s;hment of their crimes.</P>
<P>We now proceed to a more particular de&s;crip|tion of the &s;everal kingdoms u&s;ually comprehend|ed under the name of Barbary, viz. Morocco and Fez, Algier, Tunis, Tripoli, and Barca, all which, except the fir&s;t, lie along the coa&s;t of the Mediterranean.</P>

<HEAD>MOROCCO EMPIRE.</HEAD>
<P>This empire, comprehending the kingdoms of Mo|rocco and Fez, an&s;wering nearly to the Mauntania Tingitanea of the antients, is bounded by the medi|teranean &s;ea on the north; by the river Malva, or Mulloo&iuml;ah, as it is called by the Moors, which divides it from Algier on the ea&s;t; by Biledulgerid on the &s;outh; and by the Atlantic ocean on the we&s;t; being about five hundred miles in length from &s;outh to north, and two hundred broad from ea&s;t to we&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="188" REF="1870">
The air of this country, though hot and dry, is plea&s;ant and healthy, the winds from the &s;ea and Mount Atlas refre&s;hing the inhabitants in the hot|te&s;t &s;ea&s;on.</P>
<P>As to the &s;oil, it is neither &s;o mountainous, &s;andy, or barren, as many other parts of Africa, but produces, or would produce, if duly cultivated, va&s;t quantities of corn, wine, and oil: no county affords better wheat, barley, or rice; both the French and Spaniards fetch the&s;e from the Barbary coa&s;t, when they have a &s;carcity at home; and our garri&s;ons of Gibraltar and Port-Mahon are often &s;upplied with provi&s;ions from thence. The plains of Fez and Morocco are well planted with olives, and there are no better grapes for making wine in the world, as the Jews at Tetuan experience; though the cultivation of vines is not encouraged among the Mahommedans, in con&s;equence of the precept in the Coran, forbidding the drinking of wine. Here are al&s;o other fruits, as dates, figs, rai&s;ins, almonds, apples, pears, cherries, plumbs, citrons, lemons, oranges, pomegranates, with plenty of roots and herbs, hemp, flax, &s;ugar, ho|ney, and wax; but they have not many fore&s;t trees, and &s;carce any good timber; po&s;&s;ibly their &s;oil is not proper for timber, or they take no care to pre|&s;erve it, having little occa&s;ion for any.</P>
<P>The animals of this part of Africa, whether wild or tame, are much the &s;ame we meet with to the &s;outhward, except the elk, the elephant, and the rhinoceros, which no travellers pretend to meet with in the empire of Morocco; and as they want the&s;e, &s;o they have &s;ome others not to be found in the South of Africa, particularly camels, dromedaries, and that fine breed of hor&s;es, called barbs, which, for their beauty and &s;wiftne&s;s, can &s;carce be paralleled in the world. Nor are their hor&s;es to be admired only for their beauty and

&s;peed, but their u&s;e in war, being extremely ready to obey their riders upon the lea&s;t &s;ign, in charging, wheeling, or retiring; &s;o that the trooper has his hands very much at liberty, and can make the be&s;t u&s;e of his arms.</P>
<P>As to mountains, the chief are that chain which goes under the name of Mount Atlas, and runs the whole length of Barbary, from ea&s;t to we&s;t, pa&s;&s;ing through Morocco, and abutting upon that ocean, which &s;eparates the ea&s;tern from the we&s;|tern continent, and is from this mountain called the Atlantic Ocean. This mountain, as the poets feigned, &s;u&s;tained the univer&s;e; hence we &s;ee Atlas repre&s;ented with the world upon his &s;houlders, and de&s;criptions of the globe, or &s;ets of maps dignified with the name of Atlas. Dr. Shaw, however, a&s;|&s;ures us that this chain cannot &s;tand in competition either with the Alps or Appennines for height. Near the &s;treights &s;tands the mountain antiently called Abyla, and now, if we are not mi&s;taken, by our countrymen &s;tiled the Apes hill.</P>
<P>The principal rivers, be&s;ides the Malva, or Mulvia above mentioned, which ri&s;es in the de&s;erts, and running from &s;outh to north, divides Morocco from the kingdom of Algiers, are the Suz, Om|mirabih, Rabbatta, Larache, Darodt, Sebon, Gueron and Ten&s;ift, which ri&s;e in Mount Atlas, and fall into the Atlantic Ocean.</P>
<P>The chief capes are Cape Threeforks, on the Miditerranean, Cape Spartel, at the entrance of the &s;traits, Cape Cantin, Cape None, and Cape Rajador, on the Atlantic Ocean.</P>
<P>Of the bays the mo&s;t con&s;iderable are, the bay of Tetuan, in the Mediterranean, and the bay of Tangier, in the &s;trait of Gibraltar.</P>
<P>There are &s;ome mines of very fine copper in this empire; but, if there are any of gold and

&s;ilver, as &s;ome writers tell us, they have never been opened, as far as we can find.</P>
<P>The traffic of the empire by land, is either with Arabia or Negroland: to Mecca they &s;end cara|vans, con&s;i&s;ting of &s;everal thou&s;and camels, hor&s;es, and mules, twice every year, partly for traffic, and partly upon a religious account; for numbers of pilgrims take that opportunity of paying their de|votions to their great prophet. The goods they carry to the Ea&s;t are woollen manufactures, very fine Morocco &s;kins, indigo, cochineal, and o&s;trich feathers; and they bring back from thence, &s;ilk, mu&s;lins, and drugs. By their caravans to Negro|land, they &s;end &s;alt, &s;ilk, and woollen manufactures, and bring back gold and ivory in return, but chiefly negroes; for from hence it is, that their emperor chiefly recruits his black cavalry, tho' there are al&s;o great numbers born in the country; for they bring tho&s;e of both &s;exes very young from Ne|groland, the females for breeders, and the males for &s;oldiers: as they grow up, the fir&s;t carry a mu&s;|ket, and &s;erve on foot, and after &s;ome time are preferred to be cavaliers: and as they have no other hopes or dependence but the favour of the empe|ror, they prove much the mo&s;t dutiful and ob&s;e|quious of all his &s;ubjects, and indeed, &s;upport his tyranny over the re&s;t. The caravans always go &s;trong enough to defend them&s;elves again&s;t the wild Arabs in the de&s;erts of Africa and A&s;ia; tho' notwith&s;tanding all their vigilance, &s;ome of the &s;tragglers and baggage often fall into their hands: they are al&s;o forced to load one half of their camels with water, to prevent their peri&s;hing with drought and thir&s;t in tho&s;e inho&s;pitable de&s;erts; and there is &s;till a more dangerous enemy, and that is the &s;and it&s;elf; when the winds ri&s;e, the caravan is per|fectly blinded with du&s;t; and there have been in|&s;tances
<PB N="191" REF="1900">
both in Africa and A&s;ia, where whole cara|vans, and even armies, have been buried alive in the &s;ands. There is no doubt al&s;o, but both men and cattle are &s;ometimes &s;urpri&s;ed by wild bea&s;ts, as well as robbers, in tho&s;e va&s;t de&s;erts; the hot winds al&s;o, blowing over a long tract of burning &s;and, are equal almo&s;t to the heat of an oven, and de&s;troy abundance of merchants and pilgrims. If it was not for devotion, and in expectation of very great gains, no man would undertake a jour|ney in the&s;e de&s;erts; great are the hazards and fa|tigues they mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity undergo; but tho&s;e that go to Mecca a&s;&s;ure them&s;elves of paradi&s;e if they die, and have uncommon honours paid them at home, if they &s;urvive. People crowd to be taken into the Ea&s;tern caravans; and the gold that is found in the South, make them no le&s;s eager to undertake that journey.</P>
<P>The natives have hardly any trading ve&s;&s;els, but are &s;eldom without &s;ome cor&s;airs. The&s;e, and Eu|ropean merchant &s;hips, bring them whatever they want from abroad; as linen and woollen cloth, &s;tuffs, iron wrought and unwrought, arms, gun|powder, lead, and the like: for which they take in return, copper, wax, hides, Morocco leather, wool (which is very fine) gums, &s;oap, dates, al|monds, and other fruits.</P>
<P>The coins of this empire are a fluce, a blan|quil, and ducat. The fluce is a &s;mall copper coin, twenty whereof make a blanquil, of the value of two-pence &s;terling. The blanquil is of &s;ilver, and the ducat of gold, not unlike that of Hungary, and worth about nine &s;hillings. Both the&s;e pieces are &s;o liable to be clipped and filed by the Jews, that the Moors always carry &s;cales in their pockets to weigh them; and when they are found to be much dimini&s;hed in their weight, they are re|coined by the Jews, who are ma&s;ters of the mint,
<PB N="192" REF="1910">
by which they gain a con&s;iderable profit; as they do al&s;o by exchanging the light pieces for tho&s;e that are full weight. Merchant's accompts are kept in ounces, ten of which make a ducat; but in payments to the government, it is &s;aid, they will reckon &s;eventeen one-half for a ducat.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to religion, the inhabitants of Mo|rocco are Mohammedans, of the &s;ect of Ali; and have a mufti, or high prie&s;t, who is al&s;o the &s;u|preme civil magi&s;trate, and the la&s;t re&s;ort in all cau&s;es eccle&s;ia&s;tical and civil; and the re&s;t of their clergy, who perform divine &s;ervice in their mo&s;ques, are the only judges in their provinces and great towns, except in matters of &s;tate, and military af|fairs, of which the great officers and governors take cognizance, and &s;ometimes al&s;o controul the civil magi&s;trate, impri&s;oning arbitrarily, and putting men to death without any trial or form of ju&s;tice. They have a great veneration for their hermits, and for idiots and madmen; as well as for tho&s;e, who by their tricks have got the reputation of wiz|zards; all whom they look upon as in&s;pired per&s;ons, and not only honour as &s;aints, while they live, but build tombs and chapels over them when dead; which places are not only devoutly vi&s;ited by their devotees far and near, but are e&s;teemed inviolable &s;anctuaries for all &s;orts of criminals, except in ca&s;es of trea&s;on.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the natives are zealous Mo|hammedans, they allow foreigners the free and open profe&s;&s;ion of their religion, and their very &s;laves have their prie&s;ts and chapels in the capital city. Here, as in all other Mohammedan countries, the Alcoran and their comments upon it, are their only written laws; and tho' in &s;ome in&s;tances, their cadis, and other civil magi&s;trates, are controuled by the arbitrary determinations of their princes, ba&s;has, generals, and military officers, yet the lat|ter
<PB N="193" REF="1920">
have generally a very great deference and regard for their laws. Murder, theft, and adultery, are commonly puni&s;hed with death; and their puni&s;h|ments for other crimes, particularly tho&s;e again&s;t the &s;tate, are very cruel; as impaling, dragging the pri&s;oner thro' the &s;treets at a mule's heels, till all his fle&s;h is torn off; throwing him from a high tower upon iron hooks; hanging him upon hooks till he dies; crucifying him again&s;t a wall; and, indeed, the puni&s;hment and condemnation of cri|minals, is, in a manner, arbitrary. The emperor, or his ba&s;has, frequently turn executioners; &s;hoot the offender, or cut him to pieces with their own hands, or command others to do it in their pre&s;ence.</P>
<P>The emperor exerci&s;es an uncontroulable power over the lives and fortunes of his &s;ubjects. The authority of the mufti, indeed, by their law, is &s;aid to be &s;uperior to his; and that if he was to be &s;ummoned before the latter, even by the meane&s;t of his &s;ubjects, he mu&s;t &s;ubmit. But the danger of &s;uch an attempt, which would only bring death and de&s;truction to the plaintiff, is of it&s;elf &s;ufficient to deter them from it, were tho&s;e pontiffs le&s;s the emperor's creatures, than they commonly are.</P>
<P>The public revenue here ari&s;es chiefly from the taxes upon all po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of the &s;ubject, and from a poll-tax of a ducat and a half on every head, a twelfth of all the grain, a tenth of all the cattle and goods, be&s;ides many other duties, which are oc|ca&s;ional and arbitrary. To the&s;e we may add an annual tax of &s;ix crowns per head on all the male Jews, from the age of fifteen years and upwards; be&s;ides other impo&s;ts, which he lays on them at his will and plea&s;ure. The Chri&s;tians al&s;o are forced to pay dear for the liberty of trading in his dominions, over and above the duties upon goods imported or exported. The pre&s;ents al&s;o, that are made him by Chri&s;tian princes to obtain his friend&s;hip or alliance,
<PB N="194" REF="1930">
or redre&s;s for their trading &s;ubjects, make no in|con&s;iderable part of his incomes. Add to all the&s;e the &s;hare he has in the prizes that are made, which is a fifth, if the prize was made by a private ve&s;|&s;el, and one half, if made by his &s;hips of war, tho' the whole charge of the latter is defrayed by his alcaids or governors. All the &s;laves belong to him, only he allows fifty crowns a head for &s;uch as did not fall to his &s;hare. His whole revenue, or|dinary and extraordinary, is computed at five hun|dred quintals of &s;ilver, each worth three hundred and eighty five pounds &s;terling; if the revenue of a monarch can be computed, who is continually plun|dering his &s;ubjects. As to his military forces, it is computed that the black cavalry and infantry, do not amount to le&s;s than forty thou&s;and men, and the Moori&s;h hor&s;e and foot may be as many. His naval force con&s;i&s;ts commonly of a few frigates and row-boats.</P>
<P>In regard to the character of the Moors, they are &s;aid to be a covetous unho&s;pitable people, intent upon nothing but heaping up riches, to obtain which they will be guilty of the meane&s;t things, and &s;tick at no manner of fraud.</P>
<P>The Arabs al&s;o, who are almo&s;t as numerous as the Moors, have always had the character of a pil|fering generation.</P>
<P>The people who inhabit the hills, and who have the lea&s;t to do with the court and with traffic, are much the hone&s;te&s;t people among them, and &s;till retain a good &s;hare of liberty, the government u&s;ing them rather as allies, than &s;ubjects, le&s;t they &s;hould entirely di&s;own their authority.</P>
<P>The Moors, however, with all their bad qua|lities, are ob&s;erved to be very dutiful to their pa|rents, their princes, and &s;uperiors. A plurality of wives is allowed here, as in other Mahomme|dan countries; nor do they confine them&s;elves

to women, but keep boys, as they do in Turky. The woman who commits adultery is puni&s;hed with death; but it is not difficult for them to ob|tain a divorce, if ill u&s;ed.</P>
<P>The dead are carried to the grave in their u&s;ual dre&s;s, the prie&s;ts &s;inging before them, <HI>La illa All illa, Mahomet Re&s;oul Alla,</HI> i. e. God is a great God, and Mahomet his prophet.</P>
<P>The Moors, or natives of the country, are of much the &s;ame complexion as the Spaniards on the oppo&s;ite &s;hore; but &s;uch multitudes of negroes have been brought from Guinea, that you &s;ee almo&s;t as many black as whitepeople, e&s;pecially about Me|quinez, where the court re&s;ides. The habit of a Moor is a linen frock or &s;hirt next his &s;kin, a ve&s;t of &s;ilk or cloth tied with a &s;a&s;h, a pair of drawers, a loo&s;e coat, his arms bare to the elbow, as well as his legs, &s;andals or &s;lippers on his feet, and &s;ome|times people of condition wear bu&s;kins: they &s;have their heads, and wear a turban, which is ne|ver pulled off before their &s;uperiors, or in their temples; they expre&s;s their reverence both to God and man by pulling off their &s;lippers, which they leave at the door of the mo&s;que or palace, and, when they attend their prince in the city, they run bare foot after him, if the &s;treets are ever &s;o dirty. Their turbans are of fine &s;ilk, or fine linen. The habit of the women is not very diffe|rent from that of the men, except that they wear a fine linen cloth or caul on their heads, in&s;tead of a turban, and their drawers are much larger and longer than the men's. The women al&s;o, when they go abroad, have a linen cloth over their faces, with holes in it for their eyes, like a ma&s;k.</P>

It is al&s;o much richer and more fertile than Morocco in all &s;orts of grain, fruit, cattle, wax, and would be &s;till more &s;o, if it was duly cultivated; but &s;uch is the indolence of the natives, who are contented with a bare &s;ufficiency for them&s;elves, and have no incli|nation, but rather a di&s;like, to the &s;ending any grain out of the kingdom, that a great part of its rich lands lie wa&s;te and neglected.</P>
<P>This kingdom is divided into the &s;even provinces of Fez Proper, Teme&s;na, A&s;gar, Habat, Errif or El-Riffe, Garet or Alcaia, and Chaouz or Chaus. Some geographers make only one province of A&s;|gar and Habat, under the name of Algarbe.</P>

The &s;treets &s;warm with men of all profe&s;&s;ions, and with merchants of all &s;orts; this place being e&s;teemed the general magazine of Barbary, to which all &s;orts of goods are brought, and exchanged, and &s;ent in|to the other provinces to be exchanged for tho&s;e of the country.

Sallee, the antient Sala, is &s;ituated on the At|lantic Ocean, at the mouth of a river, called Ba|ragrag or Burregreg. The harbour here, though the be&s;t in the whole empire, and the rendezvous of the cor&s;airs, or Sallee rovers, as they are called, is almo&s;t dry at low, and has not above twelve feet at high water, together with a very inconvenient bar. All the merchandizes imported pay a tenth of their value to the government; but the prin|cipal wealth of the place ari&s;es from its piratical trade. The Sallee rovers, though but &s;mall ve&s;|&s;els, are crowded with men, and &s;ometimes take valuable prizes. There are no merchant &s;hips here, nor any where el&s;e in the empire belonging to the Moors, nor is any foreign trade carried on by them in their own bottoms. And indeed it &s;eems a happine&s;s, that all the Morocco dominions do not afford one tolerable harbour. Better ports might be an inducement to increa&s;e their naval force, and con&s;equently to become a greater annoyance; but no flouri&s;hing fair trade could be expected under a government &s;o de&s;potic, oppre&s;&s;ive, and rapa|cious. The land is judged capable of producing a hundred times more than the inhabitants can con&s;ume, yielding three crops a year; yet, ex|cept within about three leagues of a town, it has no proprietor. Tho&s;e who have a little money are afraid to let it out upon intere&s;t, left they &s;hould be reputed wealthy, and con&s;equently become a prey: for this rea&s;on they bury it, with any fur|niture they have of value, nothing being &s;een in their hou&s;es but a mat or two to lie on, and a few ordinary things. The tyranny of the government is &s;aid to be the motive of the Arabs continuing a wandering life, le&s;t, by living in fixed habitations, they &s;hould forfeit all property and liberty by the rapaciou&s;ne&s;s of the officers.</P>

<P>Tangier, formerly Tingis, from which the pro|vince was &s;tiled Tingitania, or Mauritania Tingi|tana, &s;tands on a bay not far from the &s;trait of Gib|raltar.

It com|prehends the antient Mauritania Cae&s;arien&s;is, with a part of Numidia Proper, called al&s;o formerly the Country of the Ma&s;&s;yli, and Terra Metagonitis.</P>
<P>The air of this country is healthful and tem|perate; neither too hot in &s;ummer, nor too &s;harp and cold in winter. The winds are ge|nerally from the we&s;t-by-north to the ea&s;t: tho&s;e from the ea&s;t are common at Algier, from May to September, at which time the we&s;ter|ly winds take place, and become the mo&s;t fre|quent: the &s;outherly winds, which are u&s;ually hot and violent, are not frequent at Algier; they blow &s;ometimes for five or &s;ix days together, render|ing the air &s;o exce&s;&s;ively &s;uffocating, that, during their continuance, the inhabitants are obliged to &s;prinkle their floors with water. It is &s;eldom known to rain in this climate, during the &s;ummer &s;ea&s;on; and in mo&s;t parts of the Sahara, or De&s;ert, on the &s;outh of Algier, they have no rain at all.</P>

The&s;e la&s;t enjoy a con&s;tant verdure; for in February the trees begin to bud, and in April they &s;how their fruit in full growth, which are mo&s;tly ripe by May. The grapes are fit to gather in June, and the figs, peaches, nectarines, apricots, olives, nuts, &amp;c. in Augu&s;t. There is but one kind of wheat and barley cultivated in this country; in &s;ome di&s;tricts, where they have a command of water during the &s;ummer &s;ea&s;on, the natives cultivate rice, Indian corn, and particularly a white &s;ort of millet, which the Arabs call drah, and prefer to barley for the fattening of their cattle: oats are not cultivated at all by the Arabs, the hor&s;es of this country feeding altogether upon barley. The Moors and Arabs continue to tread out their corn, after the pri|mitive cu&s;tom in the Ea&s;t; after it is trodden out, they winnow it by throwing it up into the air with &s;hovels, lodging it afterwards in matramores or &s;ub|terraneous magazines. Be&s;ides the fruit mentioned above, here are great numbers of palm, plum, cherry, mulberry, apple, pear, pomegranate, and olive trees, with prickle pears, and walnuts, but no filbert, goo&s;eberry, or currant trees.

<P>The whole force of Algiers con&s;i&s;ts in about &s;ix thou&s;and Turks and Cologlies, who are employed either in gari&s;oning towns, in manning their crui&s;ers, or forming three flying camps, that are &s;ent out every &s;ummer under the command of the provin|cial viceroys. To the Turki&s;h troops we may join two thou&s;and Moori&s;h hor&s;e and foot, yet the&s;e, though kept in con&s;tant pay, being hereditary ene|mies to the Turks, are not much depended on. The method therefore that is u&s;ed to keep this large and populous kingdom in obedience, is chiefly by fomenting the di&s;putes and divi&s;ions, that always &s;ub&s;i&s;t among the Arabian tribes and princes; for were the Arabs to lay a&s;ide their quarrels, and act in concert, they would &s;oon be able to rid them&s;elves of the Turks.</P>
<P><PB N="208" REF="2070">
The&s;e Arabs live here under tents, as they do almo&s;t every where el&s;e. None of them follow any regular trade or employment; but their whole life is one continued round of idlene&s;s and diver|&s;ion; when no pa&s;time calls them abroad, they do nothing all the day but loiter at home, &s;moke their pipe, or repo&s;e them&s;elves under &s;ome neighbour|ing &s;hade. They have no reli&s;h at all for dome&s;|tic plea&s;ures, and are rarely known to conver&s;e with their wives, or play with their children; what they value above every thing, and place their highe&s;t &s;a|tisfaction in, is riding and managing their hor&s;es. The Arab women make the cloathing and furniture for their family, particularly their Hykes, or woollen blankets, and the webs of goats hair for their tents.</P>
<P>The greate&s;t part of the Moori&s;h women would be reckoned beauties even in Britain; their chil|dren certainly have the fine&s;t complexions of any nation what&s;oever. The boys indeed, by wearing only the tiara, are expo&s;ed &s;o much to the &s;un, that they quickly attain the &s;warthine&s;s of Arabs, but the girls keeping more at home, pre&s;erve their beauty till they are thirty, at which age they are u&s;ually pa&s;t child bearing. It &s;ometimes happens, that one of the&s;e girls is a mother at eleven, and a grand-mother at two and twenty.</P>
<P>The Algerines are great pirates, and reckoned the mo&s;t formidable of all Africa. They are ex|tremely avaricious and cruel to tho&s;e that fall into their hands, e&s;pecially to the Chri&s;tians.</P>
<P>The kingdom of Algier is divided into eighteen provinces, but there are but few towns in it of any note even along the &s;ea-coa&s;t, except the ca|pital, which gives name to it, and is &s;uppo&s;ed to be the antient Ico&s;ium. The Arabs, who have aboli&s;hed all the Roman names, call it Al Gezir, or the I&s;land, on account of a &s;mall one that lies oppo&s;ite to its mole, and that hath been corrupted

into Algier. It &s;tands on the declivity of a hill, &s;o that the hou&s;es ri&s;e one above another, by which means they have a full view of the &s;ea. The walls are twelve feet thick, flanked with towers and ba&s;tions, and &s;urrounded with a wide ditch. The hou&s;es are built in a very different manner from tho&s;e in Europe, and are only one &s;tory high; they have no gardens behind, but only on the tops, which are covered with earth; nor have they any chimnies, the fires being made in large earthen pots, placed near the door to let out the &s;moke.</P>
<P>Of all the buildings of the city the dey's palace, which &s;tands in the heart of it, is the large&s;t and noble&s;t. Here are al&s;o about &s;ixty public baths, &s;ome of them finely paved with marble; upwards of a hundred mo&s;ques, mo&s;tly &s;ituated along the &s;ea-&s;ide; plenty of taverns and cooks &s;hops, kept generally by Chri&s;tian &s;laves; a great num|ber of public fountains, and magnificent tombs. The mole or harbour, and the &s;mall i&s;land lying oppo&s;ite to it, are defended by &s;everal forts, one of which called the imperial ca&s;tle, commands the whole city and harbour. The great men let their beards grow; but the re&s;t &s;have both head and face, leaving only a pair of whi&s;kers, and a lock on the head, by which they fancy they will be drawn up to Paradi&s;e. We are told there are above eighteen thou&s;and gardens about the city, with &s;ummer hou&s;es, and other accommodations, and plenty of all &s;orts of fruit. The Chri&s;tian &s;laves are very numerous, not only in this city, but all over the kingdom, the cor&s;airs continually bringing fre&s;h &s;upplies of them. The country &s;eats in the neigh|bourhood are little white hou&s;es, &s;haded by a va|riety of fruit trees, and ever-greens, and well &s;up|plied with water from many rivulets and fountains. According to Dr. Shaw, the town, when he was there, contained about two thou&s;and Chri&s;tian &s;laves,
<PB N="210" REF="2090">
fifteen thou&s;and Jews, and a hundred thou&s;and Mo|hammedans, with a few renegadoes.</P>
<P>The greate&s;t commerce of the Algerines con|&s;i&s;ts in the merchandize which they obtain by pyratical plunder of the Chri&s;tians over the whole Mediterranean, and part of the ocean. Above two thou&s;and &s;hops are kept in the two Bazars by foreigners. The marine here is &s;o &s;trong, that they fit out every year upwards of twenty ve&s;&s;els, hav|ing three or four hundred men each on board.</P>
<P>Of the other towns the chief are Con&s;tantina, antiently Cirta, &s;tanding about thirty leagues from the Mediterranean; Gigeri, &s;ituate on the &s;ea|coa&s;t, about forty leagues ea&s;t of Algiers; Bugia, the antient Saldae, &s;tanding on the &s;ame coa&s;t, be|tween Gigeri and Algier, and giving name to a bay; Tenez, the capital of a province, about two miles from the &s;ea, between Oran and Algier; Sargel, about fifteen miles from the &s;ea, between Tenez and Algier; Mo&s;tagan, on the &s;ea-coa&s;t, at the mouth of the river Shelif, twenty miles ea&s;t of Oran; Mazagran, a &s;trong town with a large con|venient port, not far from Oran; Mazalquiver, a &s;mall town, &s;uppo&s;ed to be the Portus Magnus of Ptolemy, having a very &s;pacious haven &s;ituate &s;ome miles we&s;t of Oran, and belonging to the Portu|gue&s;e; Oran, a &s;trong town, &s;uppo&s;ed by &s;ome to be the Colonia Unica of the Romans, &s;tanding a hun|dred and fifty miles we&s;t of Algier; Tremecen, an|tiently Timi&s;ii, a large and well fortified town not far from the &s;ea; Sgigata, or Stora, the Ru&s;icada of Ptolemy, at the ea&s;tern extremity of the gulph, to which it gives name; Tagoeite, a &s;mall port, the antient Sulluco, or Collops Parvus of Ptolemy; Bona, called by the Moors Blaid el Aneb, or Town of Jujebs, from the plenty of them gathered in the neighbourhood, &s;tanding on a gulph, called antiently the gulph of Hippo, from the city of

<HEAD>The KINGDOM of TUNIS.</HEAD>
<P>This kingdom, a part of the once celebrated republic of Carthage or Africa Propria, is bound|ed on the ea&s;t by Tripoli; on the we&s;t by the river Guadilbarbar, which parts it from Algier; on the &s;outh by Biledulgerid, properly &s;o called; and on the north by the Mediterranean, extending from ea&s;t to we&s;t almo&s;t &s;ixty leagues, and from &s;outh to north about a hundred and five.</P>
<P>The &s;oil is barren and &s;andy, except towards the we&s;t, where it is pretty fertile, being watered by &s;everal rivers, as the Guadilbarbar, the Me|jerdah, antiently Bagadras, or Baragada, the Ha|mee&s;e, the My&s;ki-anah, the Miliana, antiently Catada, and the Gabbs, antiently Triton.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides &s;ome &s;maller ones, here is a large lake, called Shibkah el Lowdeah, or the lake of Marks, from a number of trunks of palm trees that are placed at proper di&s;tances, to direct the caravans. This lake extends it&s;elf near twenty leagues from ea&s;t to we&s;t, and is inter&s;per&s;ed with &s;everal dry &s;pots, or i&s;lands: one of the&s;e, though uninhabited, is of a con&s;iderable extent, and well &s;tocked with date-trees.</P>
<P>Some of the vallies of Tunis are very fruitful, pro|ducing corn, oil, and grapes; and no country is more proper for the culture of &s;ilk, as abounding in mul|berry
<PB N="212" REF="2110">
trees. Among their animals they have a pro|digious number of camels, and fine hor&s;es.</P>
<P>The mountains are &s;ome branches of Atlas, that run through a great part of it.</P>
<P>The principal bays are tho&s;e of the antient Car|thage, the bay of Tunis, and the gulphs of Sidra and Guletta; and the capes tho&s;e of Bi&s;erta, Car|thage, Bona, Mezurat, and Rozatim, Cape Blanco, and Cape Zibeeb.</P>
<P>Among the principal curio&s;ities and antiquities are to be ranked the Hammam Leef, a noted bath, very much re&s;orted to by the citizens of Tunis; the hot bath, with &s;ome ruins, at the Creek of Gurbos, the Aquae Calidae of Livy; the Salt Lake near Tobulba, the Stagnum Salinarum of Hirtius; the Jibbel Had-diffa, an entire mountain of Salt, &s;ituated near the ea&s;tern extremity of the lake of Marks, who&s;e &s;alt is as hard and as &s;olid as &s;tone, and of a reddi&s;h or purple colour; the lead ores at Jibbel Ri&s;-&s;a&s;s, near Hammam Leef; the ruins of Carthage, and other antient cities. Among tho&s;e of Carthage, there &s;till remain &s;ome of the &s;pacious ci&s;terns or re&s;ervoirs of water, which was brought out of the country, about thirty miles, by arched aqueducts, part of which are &s;till remain|ing, being thirty-five feet high. The city &s;tood on a penin&s;ula, and on an elevated &s;ituation, and there|fore was very ea&s;ily fortified; but there is no fre&s;h water near it, which was the rea&s;on that they were obliged to fetch it at &s;o great a di&s;tance. About fifty miles al&s;o to the &s;outh of Tunis, there is &s;till remaining a Roman amphitheatre, whereof four parts in five are yet entire; it is of an oval figure, three &s;tories high, and would contain thirty thou&s;and &s;pectators. In this kingdom lies part of tho&s;e &s;andy tracts, called antiently the greater and the le&s;&s;er Syrtis.</P>
<P><PB N="213" REF="2120">
As to manufactures, there were &s;carce any here formerly, the inhabitants &s;upplying them&s;elves in a great mea&s;ure with what they wanted by their pira|cies, but now they apply them&s;elves much more to trade. The Europeans, who are at peace with them, export from hence corn, oil, wool, &s;oap, dates, o&s;trich feathers, and &s;kins; but the natives, till of late, got more by the labour or ran&s;om of the &s;laves they took, than by any other article.</P>
<P>The religion, cu&s;toms, and government are much the &s;ame as in Algier, only here the grand &s;ignior has a ba&s;ha, who is &s;ome check upon the dey, and has a &s;mall tribute paid him. The dey is cho&s;en by the divan.</P>
<P>The kingdom of Tunis is divided into the &s;ummer and winter circuits, containing eight provinces, five of which are maritime, and three inland, be|&s;ides &s;ome &s;mall i&s;lands in the Mediterranean.</P>
<P>The capital, which gives name to the whole king|dom, &s;tands, or at lea&s;t the greate&s;t part of it, on a ri&s;ing ground, on the we&s;tern banks of a lake which goes by the &s;ame name, near the mouth of the Miliana, and in full pro&s;pect of the gulph of Guletta, and the i&s;land of Zowa-more. Tunis, &s;ome time &s;ince was noted for its cor&s;airs, but of late the inhabitants have applied them&s;elves more to trade, and are now become the mo&s;t ci|vilized and polite people of Barbary. It is com|puted to contain ten thou&s;and families, and three thou&s;and &s;hops, where they &s;ell linen and woollen cloth. The Europeans who drive the greate&s;t trade hither are the Venetians and Genoe&s;e. A great part of the inhabitants, both within and without the city, are employed in the manufacture of linen, which is the fine&s;t in all Africa; tho&s;e turbans, called tunicis, &s;o highly e&s;teemed by the Turks and Moors, being made of it. The bagnios here are very commodious and elegant. Dr. Shaw
<PB N="214" REF="2130">
tells us, that there are no le&s;s than fifteen thou&s;and licen&s;ed harlots in the city, exclu&s;ive of their concu|bines. The ruins of Carthage lie about fifteen miles to the north we&s;t. The French con&s;ul's hou&s;e here is lofty, &s;pacious, richly furni&s;hed, and of modern ar|chitecture. The magazines, warehou&s;es, and dwell|ings of the Chri&s;tian merchants, are in a &s;uburb towards the &s;ea. The territory about the city is well cultivated, and produces great variety of fruit, as lemons, oranges, pomegranates, olives, &amp;c. and wheat; but the la&s;t is very dear, and eaten only by the rich. There is a kind of herb, called harix, which if eaten to the quantity of a bare ounce, will exhilerate a man a whole day, and therefore comes dear. A &s;ort of mad, or rather ra&s;cally fel|lows here, who go about the &s;treet bare headed, and without &s;hoes or &s;tockings, are held in great vene|ration by the Mohammedans. The women are hand&s;ome, and tho&s;e of fa&s;hion go richly dre&s;&s;ed and adorned, but with their faces veiled. As they have no windows in the fronts of their hou&s;es, an European, when in the &s;treets, is apt to fancy, that he is walking between two dead walls.</P>
<P>The lake or bay of Tunis, reckoned one of the mo&s;t commodious in the Mediterranean, is joined to that of Guletta, by a narrow pa&s;&s;age, which, with two ca&s;tles that command it, makes it al&s;o very &s;afe.</P>
<P>The other places in the kingdom worth men|tioning are, Nabal, a thriving and indu&s;trious mo|dern town, near the &s;ea, about three leagues ea&s;t of Tunis, and a furlong to the we&s;t of the antient Neapolis; Urbs, about two leagues &s;outh of Tu|nis, where are &s;till to be &s;een &s;ome noble antient remains; Beggia, about thirty leagues towards the we&s;t from Tunis, and eight from the &s;ea; Sou&s;a, or Su&s;a, on the &s;ea-coa&s;t, over-again&s;t the i&s;land Pen|teleria; Mehedia, on a neck of land wa&s;hed or

<HEAD>The KINGDOM of TRIPOLI.</HEAD>
<P>This kingdom, containing the antient Regio-Syrtica, with a part of Cyrenaica, is bounded on the north by the Mediterranean; on the ea&s;t by Barca; on the &s;outh by Sahara, or the Great De&s;ert; and on the we&s;t partly by Tunis, and partly by Biledulgerid. It extends upwards of a thou&s;and miles along the coa&s;t.</P>
<P>The climate, the people, their government, reli|gion, and cu&s;toms, are much the &s;ame here as in Tunis; for here is a dey or bey, who is a kind of doge or chief, as well as general of the whole na|tion, under the protection of the Grand Seignior, who&s;e ba&s;ha collects an annual tribute, but has no|thing to do in appointing the dey, who is cho&s;en by the Turki&s;h &s;oldiers, and depo&s;ed by them, whenever they do not approve his admini&s;tration. The&s;e Turki&s;h &s;oldiers, who govern this exten&s;ive country, are not more than three or four thou&s;and, though they have a great many hundred thou&s;and Moors and Arabs under their juri&s;diction.</P>
<P>As to the &s;oil, this country is one of the riche&s;t in Barbary; the vallies, where cultivated, producing corn, grapes, olives, dates, &s;ilk, and all manner of fruits and plants proper to a warm climate.</P>
<P>Some branches of Mount Atlas extend to this country; but we hear of no rivers of any note, ex|cept that called Capes, which ri&s;es in the &s;andy de|&s;ert to the &s;outh, and, after dividing this kingdom from that of Tunis, falls into the Mediterranean. In this kingdom lie mo&s;t of tho&s;e parts of the coa&s;t antiently called the Greater and Le&s;&s;er Syrtis.</P>
<P>The Turks of Tripoli, like tho&s;e of Algiers and Tunis, are an abandoned race, con&s;i&s;ting of pirates, banditti, and the very refu&s;e of Turkey, who have
<PB N="217" REF="2160">
been forced to leave their country to avoid the pu|ni&s;hment of their crimes; and do not differ in any re&s;pect from tho&s;e of Algiers and Tunis, only they are not &s;o powerful as the Algerines.</P>
<P>Tunis is divided into four principal provinces or di&s;tricts, namely, tho&s;e of Tripoli, properly &s;o call|ed, E&s;&s;ab, Me&s;&s;ellata, and Mezerata, in each of which are &s;ome large, trading, and populous cities, e&s;pecially on the coa&s;t, where, be&s;ides &s;everal manu|factures, the inhabitants carry on the piratical bu|&s;ine&s;s to great advantage to them&s;elves, though to the great hazard and lo&s;s of mo&s;t of the European nations trading to the Mediterranean.</P>
<P>Tripoli, the metropolis of the whole, &s;tiled Tri|poli of Barbary, to di&s;tingui&s;h it from another in A&s;ia Minor, &s;tands on the &s;ea, where it opens it&s;elf in form of a cre&s;cent, in a &s;andy barren ground. It is inclo&s;ed with good walls, and, though not large, is very populous; but the &s;treets are narrow and irregular, and the hou&s;es low, dark, and mean, flat on the top, and receive mo&s;t of their light from the door. The Franci&s;can friars have a hand&s;ome church and convent here, and a good ho&s;pital, which is very nece&s;&s;ary in a place where the plague rages &s;o frequently and furiou&s;ly. The town is &s;urrounded with fine plea&s;ure hou&s;es, gardens, or|chards, &amp;c. all cultivated by poor Chri&s;tian &s;laves, to whom they hardly allow a &s;ufficient quantity of bread and water to &s;upport life.</P>
<P>The principal of the antient cities in this country were, Cyrene, the metropolis, Ar&s;inoe or Teuchira, Berenice, Ptolemais or Barce, and Apollonia, from whence the be&s;t part of it was named Pentapolis. Cyrene &s;tood at &s;ome di&s;tance from the Mediterra|nean; but the re&s;t along the coa&s;t.</P>
<P>Under the government or ba&s;ha&s;hip of Tripoli is the kingdom or country of Barca, containing the antient Marmarica, with a part of Cyrenaica. It
<PB N="218" REF="2170">
is bounded on the ea&s;t by Egypt; on the &s;outh by part of Biledulgerid; on the we&s;t by Tripoli; and on the north by the Mediterranean; extending from Cape Roxaltin on the we&s;t, to Alexandria on the ea&s;t, that is, about an hundred and &s;ixty miles; and upwards of two hundred from north to &s;outh; but is little el&s;e but a va&s;t, wild, and &s;andy de&s;ert, &s;carce a town, or cultivated &s;pot of ground, being to be found in it. It was antiently famed for the temple of Jupiter Ammon, and contains tho&s;e places called antiently the Greater and Le&s;&s;er Ca|labathmos.</P>
<P>We &s;hall here add a few reflections, extracted from different authors, in relation to the&s;e pirati|cal &s;tates.</P>
<P>The Mohammedans, wherever they are e&s;ta|bli&s;hed, e&s;pecially tho&s;e of them who partake of the genius and di&s;po&s;ition of the Turks, have very little inclination to the arts of indu&s;try. This evidently appears in the inhabitants of tho&s;e parts we have been de&s;cribing on the African coa&s;t. Being a ra|pacious and tyrannical people, hating and di&s;dain|ing all indu&s;try and labour, and neglecting all cul|ture and improvement, they naturally and nece&s;&s;a|rily became thieves and robbers; and, when they were no longer able to plunder and de&s;troy the fruitful plains of Valentia, Granada, and Andalu|&s;ia, they fell to roving upon the &s;ea. They built &s;hips, or rather took them from others, and ra|vaged the neighbouring coa&s;ts, landing in the nights, &s;urprizing, and carrying away the poor country people into &s;lavery. This was their fir&s;t occupation, and this naturally made pirates of them; for, not content with mere landing and plundering the coa&s;ts of Spain, by degrees, being grown powerful and rich, and made bold and audacious by their &s;ucce&s;s, they armed their &s;hips, and began
<PB N="219" REF="2180">
to attack, fir&s;t the Spaniards upon the high &s;eas, and then all the Chri&s;tian nations of Europe, wherever they could find them. Thus this dete&s;t|able practice of roving and robbing began. What mi&s;chief hath been brought upon the trading part of the world by the&s;e ne&s;ts of pirates, how power|ful they are grown, how the mo&s;t powerful Chri&s;|tian maritime powers are obliged meanly to make their court to them, and purcha&s;e a liberty to trade unmole&s;ted, by frequent pre&s;ents of great value, is well known to all.</P>
<P>Would the maritime powers unite, and join their fleets and forces, to deliver them&s;elves from the in&s;olence of the&s;e rovers, to &s;ecure their coa&s;ts from in&s;ults and de&s;cents, their &s;hips from cap|ture, and the per&s;ons and goods of their &s;ubjects from &s;lavery, violence, and rapine, they could hard|ly fail of &s;ucce&s;s; and were the &s;ea-coa&s;t towns to be di&s;tributed among the united powers, accord|ing to the &s;hare they had in the conque&s;t, and to be peopled with colonies of indu&s;trious Chri&s;tians, the good effects would be &s;oon and &s;en&s;ibly felt; for, if the commodities and productions of the&s;e coun|tries are &s;o con&s;iderable, while under the govern|ment of the mo&s;t indolent and barbarous people in the world, how may we &s;uppo&s;e they would be mul|tiplied and improved by the application and indu&s;|try of the Europeans. It may al&s;o rea&s;onably be &s;uppo&s;ed, that the Moors being driven up into the country, (for we do not propo&s;e the extirpating them, but only the putting it out of their power to annoy trade, by removing them from the &s;ea-coa&s;t) and being obliged to &s;eek their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence by ho|ne&s;t labour, would greatly add to the&s;e products; and that from the numbers that would be induced by the advantages of the country, to go over and &s;ettle in it, a large con&s;umption would ari&s;e, and every new &s;ettlement would be a new market for

It is about eighty miles long, and fifty-four broad, and has two very good harbours, where &s;hips u&s;ed formerly to put in &s;ometimes, when they lo&s;t their pa&s;&s;age to India. It is a populous plentiful coun|try,

yielding mo&s;t of the fruits and plants that are u&s;ually found within the tropics, together with frank|incen&s;e, gum-tragacanth, and aloes; and is under the government of a prince or &s;ultan, who was for|merly tributary to the xerifs of Arabia, and now pro|bably to the Porte. The inhabitants are Moham|medans, and of Arab extraction. They trade to Goa, whither they carry aloes, frankincen&s;e, amber|grea&s;e, cive$, dragon's blood, rice, dates, and co|ral, which are tran&s;ported from thence over many parts of India, and to all the kingdoms in Europe. The climate is exceeding hot, yet there are &s;ome lofty mountains in the i&s;land, who&s;e tops are always covered with &s;now.</P>
<P>Two very unnatural cu&s;toms prevail among the inhabitants; for parents generally give away their own children, and adopt tho&s;e of others in their &s;tead; and the &s;ick are often buried, or otherwi&s;e di&s;patched, before they have breathed their la&s;t: the la&s;t, indeed, is not unfrequently the reque&s;t of the dying per&s;on. Though they are Mohamme|dans, yet they wor&s;hip the &s;un and moon, the lat|ter e&s;pecially, when at the full and new. They are &s;aid to be deceitful, lazy, and cowardly; but inge|nious, particularly in the camboline manufacture, which is a beautiful &s;tuff, formed out of &s;uch coar&s;e materials as goats hair.</P>

<P>This i&s;land, the large&s;t in the world, called by the natives Madeca&s;i, or, according to Thevet, Albargro, by the Per&s;ians and Arabians Sarandib, and by the Portugue&s;e Ilha de San Leoranzo, or I&s;land of St. Laurence, extends in length, from north-north-ea&s;t to &s;outh-&s;outh-we&s;t, near a thou|&s;and miles; and about three hundred where broad|e&s;t; being &s;ituated between 43 and 51&deg;. of ea&s;t longitude, and between 12 and 26&deg;. of &s;outh la|titude, three hundred miles &s;outh-ea&s;t of the con|tinent of Africa.</P>
<P>The whole coa&s;t is divided by rivers; and there are many bays and gulphs, with good roads and har|bours. It abounds in corn, cattle, fowls, and all manner of animals and vegetables foundon the con|tinent of Africa; and affords an agreeable variety of hills, valleys, woods, and champaign. Great quan|tities of iron and &s;teel are found throughout this i&s;land, which their artificers forge and purify with le&s;s difficulty and labour than Europeans. Their method is this: they reduce the ore, as brought from the mines, into powder, place it upon burning coals between four &s;tones, which are clayed round for the purpo&s;e, and, by continual blowing underneath, with bellows made in the &s;hape of gun-barrels or water pumps, the ore runs in le&s;s than an hour; whence the metal being afterwards extracted, by great heat, is formed into bars of three or four pounds weight. It is confidently affirmed, that the i&s;land has al&s;o mines of gold and &s;ilver, and of a white metal, much like Briti&s;h tin. The rivers and
<PB N="223" REF="2220">
brooks are rich in various kinds of precious &s;tones, in cry&s;tals, topazes, granates, amethy&s;ts, eagle-&s;tones, emeralds, &s;apphires, hyacinths, ja&s;pers, and blood|&s;tones, called by the natives rhahamanga, and by phy&s;icians haematites, cornelians, and touch-&s;tones.</P>
<P>The inhabitants are of different complexions and religions; &s;ome white, &s;ome negroes, &s;ome Moham|medans, &s;ome Pagans.

The country is di|vided among a great many petty princes, who are continually at war with one another, as upon the continent; &s;elling their pri&s;oners or &s;laves to the &s;hipping which touch there, and taking cloath|ing, uten&s;ils, and other nece&s;&s;aries, in return. The French had once &s;ome &s;ettlements upon the i&s;land; but, at pre&s;ent, neither they nor any other Euro|pean nation have any, though, it is thought, the French will attempt to e&s;tabli&s;h them&s;elves here a|gain, if the other maritime powers do not interfere.</P>

Its form is oval, thir|teen leagues in length from ea&s;t to we&s;t, and ten in breadth from &s;outh to north. There are many good roads for &s;hipping round Bourbon, particu|larly on the north and &s;outh &s;ides; but hardly a &s;ingle harbour where the &s;hips can ride &s;ecure a|gain&s;t tho&s;e hurricanes which blow during the mon|&s;oons. Indeed, the coa&s;t is &s;o &s;urrounded with blind rocks, &s;unk a few feet below the water, that coa&s;ting along-&s;hore is at all times dangerous. On the &s;outhern extremity is a volcano, which conti|nually throws out flames, &s;moke, and &s;ulphur, with a hideous roaring noi&s;e, terrible in the night to mariners.</P>
<P>The climate here, though extremely hot, is healthy, being refre&s;hed with cooling gales, that blow morning and evening, from the &s;ea and land: &s;ometimes, however, terrible hurricanes &s;hake the whole i&s;land, almo&s;t to its foundation; but generally without any other bad con&s;equence than frighten|ing the inhabitants. The i&s;land abounds in brooks and &s;prings, and in fruit, gra&s;s, and cattle, with ex|cellent tobacco, (which the French have planted there) aloes, white pepper, ebony, palm, and other kinds of wood, and fruit-trees. Many of the trees yield odoriferous gums and re&s;ins; among the re&s;t, benzoin of an excellent kind, and in great abundance. The rivers are well &s;tocked with fi&s;h, the coa&s;t with land and &s;ea tortoi&s;es, and every part of the country with horned cattle, as well as hogs
<PB N="225" REF="2240">
and goats. The hogs live much on turtle, which, it is &s;aid, give an extraordinary flavour, richne&s;s, and delicacy to their fle&s;h. Ambergrea&s;e, coral, and the mo&s;t beautiful &s;hells, are found upon the &s;hore. The woods are full of turtle-doves, paro|quets, pigeons, and a great variety of other birds, equally beautiful to the eye, and plea&s;ant to the pa|late.</P>
<P>The French fir&s;t &s;ettled here in the year 1672, after they had quitted the i&s;land of Madaga&s;car. They have now &s;ome con&s;iderable towns in the i&s;land with a governor; and here their Ea&s;t-India &s;hips touch, and take in refre&s;hments.</P>

<P>The climate is extremely healthy and plea|&s;ant. The mountains, of which there are many, and &s;ome &s;o high, that their tops are covered with &s;now, produce the be&s;t ebony in the world, be&s;ides various other kinds of wood of value, two of which greatly re&s;emble ebony in quality; one red, the other yellow as wax. The woods abound with &s;uch numbers of birds, and &s;o tame, that they may be taken by one's hand. The i&s;land is watered with &s;everal plea&s;ant rivers, well &s;tocked with fi&s;h; and though the &s;oil is none of the mo&s;t fruit|ful, yields plenty of tobacco, rice, fruit, and

It is &s;ituated in we&s;t longitude 6&deg;. 30&prime;. and in 16&deg;. &s;outh latitude, one thou&s;and two hundred miles we&s;t of the continent of Africa, and one thou&s;and eight hundred ea&s;t of that of South-America.</P>
<P>It is a rock in the middle of the ocean, very high and &s;teep, about twenty miles in circumfe|rence, and only acce&s;&s;ible at the landing-place, which is defended by batteries of guns. The land|ing place is a &s;mall bay, like a half-moon, &s;carce five hundred paces wide, between the two points. The Engli&s;h plantations here afford potatoes and yams, with plantains, bananas, grapes, kidney-beans, and Indian corn: of the la&s;t, however, mo&s;t part is de|&s;troyed by the rats, with which the i&s;land is pe&s;ter|ed; &s;o that the flour they u&s;e is almo&s;t wholly im|ported from England, and, in a &s;carcity, they gene|rally eat yams and potatoes, in&s;tead of bread.

They have great plenty of hogs, bullocks, poul|try, ducks, gee&s;e, and turkeys, with which they &s;upply the &s;ailors, taking, in exchange, &s;hirts, drawers, or any light cloaths, pieces of callico, &s;ilks, mu&s;lins, arrack, &s;ugar, &amp;c. The air is &s;erene and temperate, and the complexions of the natives as fair and fre&s;h as in England. The Ea&s;t-India com|pany are proprietors of the i&s;land, which was given them by king Charles II. &s;oon after it was taken from the Dutch by admiral Monday, in 1672. There are about two hundred families upon it. The Ea&s;t-India &s;hips take in water and fre&s;h provi|&s;ions here, in their way home; but the i&s;land is &s;o &s;mall, and the wind &s;o much again&s;t them outward|bound, that they very &s;eldom &s;ee it then; and if a &s;hip over&s;hoots the i&s;land, and falls to leeward, it is very difficult to recover it.</P>
<P>The company's affairs here are managed by a governor, deputy-governor, and &s;tore-keeper, who have &s;tanding &s;alaries allowed by the company, be|&s;ides a public table, well furni&s;hed, to which all commanders, ma&s;ters of &s;hips, and eminent pa&s;|&s;engers are welcome. The company allow al&s;o a mini&s;ter here an hundred pounds a-year, be&s;ides the gratuities he receives from the inhabitants. All things are dear to &s;trangers, except roots and lemons. Their chief grain is kidney-beans, from eight to twelve &s;hillings a bu&s;hel. A &s;mall ox is &s;old for &s;ix pounds, and turkeys for a dollar a-piece. The company allows the &s;oldiers &s;alt meat: both they and the mechanics may earn a great deal of money by their labour.

The air, generally &s;peaking, is very hot, and in &s;ome of them very unwhole&s;ome. They are inhabited by Europeans, or the de&s;cend|ants of Europeans and negroes.</P>
<P>St. Jago, where the Portugue&s;e viceroy re&s;ides, is the mo&s;t fruitful, be&s;t inhabited, and large&s;t of them all; yet it is mountainous and has much barren land in it. Its produce is &s;ugar, cotton, &s;ome wine, and &s;everal different &s;orts of excellent fruits. St. Jago, which is the capital, and the re|&s;idence of the viceroy and governor, lies on the &s;outh &s;ide of the i&s;land.

It co&s;ts nothing ex|cept for raking it together, wheeling it out of the pond, and carrying it on a&s;&s;es to the boats, which is all done at a very cheap rate. Several of our &s;hips come hither for a freight of a&s;&s;es, which they carry to Barbadoes, and our other plantations. The inhabitants of this i&s;land, even the governor

<P>In &s;ome of the&s;e i&s;lands are great numbers of Guinea hens, &s;uch as we have now very com|monly in England, and flamingos, a large fowl, much like a heron in &s;hape, but bigger, and of a reddi&s;h colour: they feed and build their ne&s;ts in &s;hallow ponds, where there is much mud, which they &s;crape together, making little hil|locks, like &s;mall i&s;lands, tapering from the bot|tom to the top, in which they leave a &s;mall hol|low to lay their eggs in; and when they either lay their eggs or hatch them, they &s;tand all the while, not on the hillock but clo&s;e by it, with their legs on the ground and in the water, re&s;ting them&s;elves again&s;t the hillock, and covering the hollow ne&s;t upon the top of it with their rump.

Their names are Palma, Hierro, Gomera, Teneriffe, Gran Canaria, Fuerte Ventura, and Lan|zarote. Palma, and Hierro lie mo&s;t to the We&s;t: their &s;oil is rich; they have good pa&s;ture ground, produce excellent wine, &s;ugar, &amp;c. and abound in fruits.

It is eleven leagues broad, twelve long, thirty-eight in compa&s;s, and about thirty from Cape Bo&s;ador on the coa&s;t of Africa. Its &s;itua|tion is ea&s;t of Teneriffe, and its capital city Palma, Palmes, or Canaria. In fertility it equals, at lea&s;t, if it does not exceed any of the others.</P>
<P>Fuerte Ventura, lies ea&s;t of Gran Canaria, and about twenty-five leagues from the coa&s;t of Africa. It is likewi&s;e fruitful, and has four towns, Tara|fala, Lanagala, Pozzo Negro, and Fuerte Ven|tura.</P>
<P>Lanzarote, lying north of the former, and in all points an&s;wering to the re&s;t, has three towns, Lanza|rote, Puerto de Naos, and Puerto de Cavallos.</P>
<P>Though the&s;e &s;even are the principal i&s;lands that go under the name of the Canaries, yet there are &s;everal others in the neighbourhood of le&s;s note; as the I&s;la de los Lobos, &s;ituate between Fuerte Ventura, and Lanzarote; Salvatica, lying further towards the north we&s;t; add to the&s;e Roc|ca, Gratio&s;a, Santa Clara, and Aagranza, on the north of Lanzarote. They are all &s;ubject to the king of Spain, and Canaria is the See of a bi&s;hop, &s;ubject to the metropolitan of Seville. Canaria for|merly produced a &s;ort of dates, and pine apples,
<PB N="234" REF="2330">
in con&s;iderable plenty, according to Pliny. In the rivers al&s;o of the&s;e i&s;lands grows the plant papy|rus, as in the Nile, if the &s;ame author may be cre|dited. From the cu&s;tom of pre&s;erving the bodies of their ance&s;tors, in the manner above mentioned, it &s;eems probable, that the antient inhabitants of Teneriffe were either a colony of the Ethiopi|ans, or de&s;cended from the fir&s;t progenitors of that people. The Canaries abound with tho&s;e little beautiful &s;inging birds that bear their name, and are now &s;o common and &s;o much ad|mired in Europe; but their wild notes in their native land far excel tho&s;e in a cage or foreign clime. Of the rich wines, which from hence ob|tain the name of Canary, no le&s;s, it is &s;aid, than ten thou&s;and hog&s;heads are annually exported to England in time of peace.</P>
<P>The i&s;land of Hierro or Ferro, which has nei|ther river, &s;pring, fountain, nor well, was form|erly, we are told, &s;upplied with water, by means of a particular &s;ort of tree, each of which yielded a large quantity in the night, when a cloud always hovered over them; but the inhabitants now &s;ave rain water in ci&s;terns, and for common u&s;e filtrate bracki&s;h water.</P>

<HEAD>The MADEIRA ISLANDS.</HEAD>
<P>The three i&s;lands called the Madeiras, are &s;ituate under the &s;eventeenth and eighteenth degrees of we&s;t longitude, and between thirty-two and thirty-three degrees of north latitude, about a hundred miles north of the Canaries, and as many we&s;t of Sallee in Morocco. The chief of them, from which the re&s;t derive the general name of Maderas, or Madeiras, is about &s;eventy-five miles long, &s;ixty broad, and a hundred and eighty in circumference. Though it &s;eems to have been known to the antients, yet it
<PB N="235" REF="2340">
lay concealed for many generations; and was at length di&s;covered by the Portugu&s;e, commanded by Don Juan Zarco, and Don Tri&s;tano vaz, in 1519. Others maintain that one John Machin, an Eng|li&s;hman, di&s;covered it in the year 1344. Be that as it will, the Portugue&s;e took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it in the year above mentioned, and are &s;till almo&s;t the only people inhabiting it. The name Madera, or Madeira was derived from the va&s;t &s;tore of wood with which it was &s;tocked, the Portugue&s;e, at their fir&s;t landing, finding it little better than a thick fore&s;t. In order, therefore, to render the ground capable of cultivation, they &s;et fire to this wood, which, ac|cording to their writers, occa&s;ioned a conflagration of &s;even years continuance. It is now very fertile, producing in great abundance, the riche&s;t wine, &s;u|gar, the mo&s;t delicious fruits, e&s;pecially oranges, lemons, and pomegranates, together with corn, honey, and wax. It abounds al&s;o with boars and other wild bea&s;ts, and with all &s;orts of fowls, be|&s;ides numerous groves of cedar trees, and tho&s;e that yield dragon's blood, ma&s;tic, and other gums. The air of Madeira is more temperate than that of the Canaries, yet &s;o warm, that there is here a perpetual &s;pring, and fruit or blo&s;&s;oms through|out the whole year. The lemons here are va&s;tly large, and even the European fruit trees thrive exceedingly. The inhabitants of this i&s;land make the be&s;t &s;weetmeats in the world, and &s;ucceed won|derfully in pre&s;erving citrons and oranges, and in making marmalades and perfumed pa&s;tes, which exceed tho&s;e of Genoa, whatever the Italians may pretend. The &s;ugar they make is extremely beautiful, and &s;mells naturally of violets. This, it is &s;aid, was the fir&s;t place in the We&s;t where that manufacture was &s;et on foot; but the Portugue&s;e not finding it &s;o profitable as at fir&s;t, have pulled up the greate&s;t part of their &s;ugar canes, and
<PB N="236" REF="2350">
planted vineyards in their &s;tead, which produce &s;everal &s;orts of excellent wines, as that which bears the name of the i&s;land, malm&s;ey, and tent, of all which the inhabitants make and &s;ell prodi|gious quantities. No le&s;s than twenty thou&s;and hog&s;heads, it is &s;aid, are yearly exported, the greate&s;t part to the We&s;t Indies, e&s;pecially to Barbadoes; Madeira wine not only enduring a hot climate better than any other, but being even improved, when expo&s;ed to the &s;un, in the barrel, after the bung is taken off.</P>
<P>Of the two other i&s;lands one is called Porto Santo, which lies at a &s;mall di&s;tance from Madera, and under the juri&s;diction of the &s;ame bi&s;hop and governor. It is only eight miles in compa&s;s, but the &s;oil is extremely fertile, producing in particular the be&s;t honey and wax in the world. The other, called by the Spaniards, I&s;la De&s;ierta, i. e. the De&s;olate I&s;le, is incon&s;iderable, being not only bar|ren, but of a very &s;mall extent.</P>

<P>IF we con&s;ider commerce, indu&s;try, and labour, as nece&s;&s;ary to the opulence and happine&s;s of &s;ociety, we cannot but regard the di&s;co|very of the va&s;t continent of America, and the in|finity of wealthy i&s;lands with which it is &s;ur|rounded, as one of the mo&s;t important con&s;e|quences of the happy di&s;covery of the compa&s;s, and the improvement in navigation. Without a knowledge of the We&s;t Indies, the intercour&s;e with the Ea&s;t would be of little advantage to Eu|rope; it might even be pernicious, by drain|ing it of the gold and &s;ilver: whereas we now purcha&s;e the commodities of the latter, not only with European manufactures, but with the &s;ilver dug in the mines of Poto&s;i. To her po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ions in Chili, Peru, Mexico, and the Antilles, Spain owes all her opulence. Great Britain hath, by means of her colonies on the continent of Ame|rica,

and her i&s;lands in the We&s;t Indies, rai&s;ed her&s;elf to her pre&s;ent a&s;toni&s;hing and much envied height of grandeur and importance. The very exi&s;tence of Portugal depends in a great mea&s;ure upon her po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions in Brazil; even the barren Canada, and Cape-Breton, were fruitful of ble&s;|ings to France, while in her po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, by pro|moting her trade and navigation, not to &s;peak of the benefits ari&s;ing to her at pre&s;ent from Guada|loupe, St. Domingo, Martinico, and St. Lucia. The intercour&s;e with Surinam, and the Spani&s;h main, and the i&s;lands of St. Eu&s;tatia, and Cura|&s;ao, have brought great wealth into Holland. In a word, every nation in Europe have made attempts to obtain &s;ome e&s;tabli&s;hments in a country fraught with all the&s;e commodities, which the progre&s;s of &s;cience, of luxury, and refinement, has rendered almo&s;t e&s;&s;ential to exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>The trade of Great-Britain is much indebted to her colonies, though it has been purcha&s;ed at a va&s;t expence of blood and trea&s;ure. The trade to the&s;e colonies is in fact a foreign commerce, carried on and conducted under the direction of the mother country; accordingly we find, that in proportion as the &s;everal crowns of Europe cheri&s;h their plantations, while at the &s;ame time they keep them in a ju&s;t &s;ubordination and dependence, they acquire a large &s;hare of maritime &s;trength, e&s;tabli&s;h a more fruitful nur&s;ery of &s;eamen, gain a more con|&s;iderable fund of wealth, and promi&s;e fairer for the &s;uperiority of the &s;ea.

<P>America was &s;o called from Americus Ve&s;pucio, a Florentine by birth, who, in 1497, was &s;ent to improve the di&s;coveries made by Columbus. The prodigious magnitude of this continent, the mul|titude and extent of its provinces, the diver&s;ity of its climates, inhabitants, and languages, its di&s;tance from Europe, its being over-run with va&s;t fore&s;ts, lakes, and mountains, inter&s;per&s;ed with large rivers, inhabited, in a great mea&s;ure, by rude uncivilized &s;avages, have been the cau&s;e that it is &s;till but im|perfectly known; though great advances have been made of late towards a more full and com|pleat di&s;covery, e&s;pecially in regard to North-Ame|rica, where exact &s;urveys have been made of many large tracts on the great inland lakes and rivers, little known before. This continent reaches, at lea&s;t what has been hitherto di&s;covered, from latitude 78&deg;. north, to latitude 56&deg;. &s;outh, that is, an hundred and thirty-four degrees; which, taken in a &s;treight line, amount to upwards of eight thou&s;and and forty miles in length. With regard to breadth, it is very irregular, being in &s;ome places three thou&s;and &s;ix hundred and ninety miles, and in others, as at the i&s;thmus of Darien, or Panama, not above &s;ixty or &s;eventy. The boundaries a&s;cribed to it are the lands about the pole on the north; the Atlantic Ocean, which &s;eparates it from Europe and A&s;ia, on the ea&s;t; another va&s;t ocean on the &s;outh; and the Pacific Ocean, u&s;ually called the South Sea, which di|vides it from A&s;ia, on the we&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="$40" REF="2390">
This va&s;t country was not di&s;covered till the year 1492, when the enterprizing genius of Co|lumbus prompted him to make the bold adventur|ous attempt, which was crowned with &s;ucce&s;s. The honour, however, of this di&s;covery, has been claimed by all the maritime nations of Europe. The Spaniards tell us, that Columbus received his lights from Captain Aldres, their countryman, who had been ca&s;t away on the coa&s;ts; and the French, &s;ay he had them from Betincourt, who fir&s;t di&s;covered the Azores. It would be a difficult matter to de|termine this conte&s;t: but it appears, that our claim to the di&s;covery of this New World is prior to that of the Spaniards, who&s;e preten&s;ions &s;eem to be the be&s;t grounded: for no one can di&s;pute the authenticity of tho&s;e vouchers, whereby it appears, that Seba&s;tian Cabot, a Venetian, a man no le&s;s enterprizing or le&s;s &s;killed in navigation, than Columbus him&s;elf, was &s;ent by our Henry VII. a year before the di&s;|covery of Columbus; and that having fir&s;t di&s;co|vered Newfoundland, he &s;ailed along the coa&s;t as far as Florida.</P>
<P>This quarter of the globe, be&s;ides the name of America, is &s;ometimes al&s;o di&s;tingui&s;hed by that of the New World, and the We&s;t Indies. The European nations, who have the large&s;t &s;ettlements or po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions in it, are the Spaniards, Engli&s;h, and Portugue&s;e; and next to them, the French, Dutch, and Danes; but mo&s;t of the&s;e &s;ettlements are only in the i&s;lands, and along the coa&s;t, the far greater part of the interior country being as yet in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the natives. How or whence America was fir&s;t peopled, cannot be a&s;cer|tained; but if the north of A&s;ia is joined to Ame|rica, as &s;eems highly probable, it is mo&s;t likely to have been from thence, e&s;pecially as the natives of the&s;e parts &s;till bear a great re&s;emblance to one

another in many re&s;pects: be&s;ides it is po&s;&s;ible &s;ome &s;hip or &s;hips might have been blown over to it from the coa&s;t of Africa or Europe, after they fir&s;t ventured into the ocean from the Mediterranean; or perhaps even from the Ethiopic or Ea&s;tern Ocean, and as they had not the u&s;e of the compa&s;s would not attempt to cro&s;s &s;uch a wide &s;ea again; but the wild bea&s;ts that are found here mu&s;t have gone thither by land, and not in &s;hips, or acro&s;s the ocean.</P>
<P>The various tribes of the native Americans, as far as we are yet acquainted with them, are found to bear a wonderful likene&s;s, both in their per&s;ons and manners; for they have all coar&s;e black hair on their heads, but none on any other parts of their bodies, not even on their faces, except tho&s;e in the country called Labrador, in North America, who have not only thick bu&s;hy beards, and hair on other parts of their bodies, but eat al&s;o raw fle&s;h, and go cloathed both in &s;ummer and winter; in all which re|&s;pects they differ from the others, and are therefore &s;uppo&s;ed to have a different origin. Several voyagers al&s;o mention a people at the other extremety of the continent, about the &s;traits of Magellan, of a gigantic &s;tature; and the&s;e accounts have been confirmed by the honourable commodore Byron and his crew, who lately returned from the South Sea in the Dolphin man of war.</P>

<HEAD>NEW BRITAIN.</HEAD>
<P>New Britain, or the country lying round Hud|&s;on's Bay, and commonly called the country of the E&s;quimaux, comprehending Labrador, New North and South Wales, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Is bounded by unknown lands about the pole on the north; by the Atlantic Ocean and Baffin's Bay on the we&s;t; by the bay and river of St. Laurence and Canada on the &s;outh; and by unknown lands on the we&s;t.</P>
<P>There are very high mountains in this country towards the north, which being perpetually covered with &s;now, and the winds blowing from thence three quarters of the year, are the chief occa&s;ion of that exce&s;&s;ive cold which is found on this continent, beyond any thing that has been known on the ea&s;tern continent, under the &s;ame parallels of la|titude. The winter generally &s;ets in in September, and continues till June; during mo&s;t of that time the &s;now lies very deep upon the ground, and the rivers are frozen eight or nine feet thick. The lands near the &s;outh end of the bay produce large timber, and plenty of herbage, and no doubt would produce corn, if cultivated. The country about Fort Nel&s;on is a low mar&s;hy &s;oil, producing juniper, birch, poplar, a &s;mall wood of the
<PB N="343" REF="2420">
&s;pruce or fir kind; but little other herbage, be&s;ides mo&s;s; neither corn nor pa&s;ture is to be expected in the north, where the earth, even in &s;ummer, remains frozen &s;ix feet deep, and the mountains are perpetually covered with &s;now. The &s;oil of the &s;outh coa&s;t of Hud&s;on's Straits, known by the name of Terra de Labrador, is much of the &s;ame nature as that on the we&s;tern &s;ide of the bay. Ter|ra de Labrador is of a triangular form, extending from the fiftieth to the &s;ixty-third degree of lati|tude, and from the fifty-fir&s;t to the &s;eventy-ninth degree of longitude, we&s;t from London. The in|land parts of this country are but little known, and are inhabited by certain tribes of E&s;quimaux In|dians, the mo&s;t untamed and untractable people in America. They were fir&s;t di&s;covered by the Danes, but no &s;ettlement has ever been made in their country. They have no &s;ettled habitations; nor do we know of any villages or towns among them: they are thought to be &s;o numerous, that they can bring thirty thou&s;and fighting men into the field; but though mi&s;chievous, untamable, and treache|rous, they are exce&s;&s;ively cowardly. Sometimes, in the night-time, they will cut the cables of &s;hips, that they may enjoy their wrecks in the morn|ing.</P>
<P>The only commodities they trade in, are furs, which they exchange for knives, &s;ci&s;&s;ars, pots, kettles, and the like hardware; but if an Euro|pean &s;hip &s;hould &s;uffer them to come on board in too great numbers, they will, if they can, ma&s;|ter the crew, and plunder the ve&s;&s;el. The food of the&s;e and the other Indians about Hud&s;on's Bay, and indeed all over America, is chiefly what they take in hunting and fi&s;hing; for here is a great variety of land animals, be&s;ides fi&s;h and fowl: among the fir&s;t are the moo&s;e deer, elks, &s;tags, rein-deer, bears, tygers, buffaloes, wolves, foxes, beavers, otters, lynxes, martens, &s;quirrels, wild cats, and
<PB N="244" REF="2430">
hares: of the feathered kind are gee&s;e, ducks, bu&s;tards, partridges, and many other &s;orts: of fi&s;h, whales, mor&s;es, &s;eals, cod, a white fi&s;h, pre|ferable to herrings, &amp;c. and in the rivers and fre&s;h waters, pike, perch, carp, and trout. The foxes, hares, and partridges turn white in winter; the la&s;t are as large as hens. There have been taken or killed at Port Nel&s;on, in one &s;ea&s;on, ninety thou|&s;and partridges, and twenty-five thou&s;and hares.</P>
<P>The principal &s;ettlements belonging to our Hud|&s;on's Bay company at pre&s;ent are, Forts Churchill, Nel&s;on, New Severn, and Albany, on the we&s;t &s;ide of the Bay; and they had formerly Forts Charles and Rupert, at the bottom of the Bay. The Engli&s;h in the&s;e factories kill beef, pork, mutton, and veni&s;on at the beginning of winter, and the&s;e are pre&s;erved by the fro&s;t &s;ix or &s;even months, free from putrefaction: gee&s;e al&s;o, partridges, and other fowls, killed at the &s;ame time, are hung up with their feathers and guts, yet hold good all the winter. In lakes and &s;tanding waters, which are not ten feet deep, the water is frozen to the bottom, and the fi&s;h killed; but in waters of greater depth, and rivers near the &s;ea, the fi&s;h are caught all the winter by cutting holes in the ice, to which they come for air. As &s;oon as they are taken out of the water, they are immediately frozen and &s;tiff, but may be thawed again by being immer&s;ed in cold water; and thus it is that the &s;alt provi&s;ions are thawed and fre&s;hened here: the meat is let down through a hole in the ice into the water, and in a little time it becomes &s;oft and pliable, as if it never had been frozen, and eats very well; whereas roa&s;ted or boiled, while frozen, it will be &s;poiled, and eat as if it was rotten. There is no want of food about Hud&s;on's Bay at any time of the year. In April come the gee&s;e, bu&s;tards, and ducks, of which they kill as many as they plea&s;e. About
<PB N="245" REF="2440">
the &s;ame time they take great numbers of rain|deer, and the&s;e do not return to the north till July or Augu&s;t. In &s;ummer they al&s;o take pike, trout, carp, and other fi&s;h; and in the beginning of winter, all manner of wild fowl return again.</P>
<P>A thou&s;and Indian men, and &s;ome women, in a|bout &s;ix hundred canoes come down u&s;ually to Port Nel&s;on to trade with the Engli&s;h. Many of them come from far di&s;tant countries, and are much delayed in their voyages, by being obliged to go on &s;hore every day to hunt for provi&s;ions; for their canoes are &s;o &s;mall, holding only two men, and a pack of beaver &s;kins, that they cannot carry much provi&s;ion with them. The&s;e Indians are of a tawny complexion, and not &s;o fair as tho&s;e in Labrador, nor of &s;uch large robu&s;t bodies; but much more gentle, and tractable. In &s;um|mer they wear &s;carce any cloaths, but anoint them&s;elves with bears grea&s;e, or the oil of &s;eals, which it is &s;aid, prevents their being &s;tung by mu&s;ketos, or bit by bugs, or any other in&s;ects; but tho&s;e in Labrador go always cloathed. In win|ter the &s;outhern E&s;quimaux Indians cloath them&s;elves with beaver &s;kins, which they oil and grea&s;e in the &s;ame manner as they do their own &s;kins in &s;ummer, which prevents the cold penetrating them, and have a kind of bu&s;kins on their legs, and &s;hoes of deer &s;kins: they u&s;e al&s;o beaver &s;kins and furs for their beds and covering in the night. The Indians of all &s;orts, inhabiting the country about Hud&s;on's Bay, lead a wandering life, &s;eldom re|maining more than a week or two in a place; and mo&s;t of their time is &s;pent in hunting and fi&s;hing.</P>
<P>The Hud&s;on's Bay company, it is probable, do not find their trade &s;o advantageous now as it was before we got po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Quebec, when they enjoyed the fur trade, almo&s;t without a rival, at lea&s;t in re&s;pect of the Briti&s;h dominions; whence
<PB N="246" REF="2450">
their profits mu&s;t have been very great, e&s;pecially as they availed them&s;elves to the utmo&s;t of their exclu&s;ive charter, and made the poor Indians pay very dear for every thing they wanted of them.</P>
<P>This company, which does not con&s;i&s;t of above nine or ten merchants, obtained their fir&s;t char|ter from Charles II. in the year 1669, by which the &s;ole property of all the lands, trade, royal fi&s;hery, and mines, within Hud&s;on's Straits, not actually po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by any Chri&s;tian prince, was ve&s;ted in them.</P>
<P>According to Mr. Dobs, who has given the be&s;t account of Hud&s;on's Bay, it may be e&s;teemed from 51&deg; to 65&deg;. north latitude, and from 78&deg; to 95&deg;. we&s;t longitude from London. The whole of its extent, in length, may be about &s;ix hundred miles, and its northern boundary may be reckoned at Davis's Straits, the country to the north of that being claimed by Denmark. The dimen&s;ions at the en|trance of the Straits are variou&s;ly repre&s;ented. At Re|&s;olution I&s;land they are &s;aid to be twelve or thirteen leagues wide, but others make it not half &s;o wide. As to the Straits them&s;elves, they are &s;aid to be a hun|dred and twenty leagues in length; the &s;hores on both &s;ides being inhabited by a mo&s;t &s;avage race. At the mouth of the Straits lies Re&s;olution I&s;land, and in the Straits them&s;elves lie the i&s;lands Charles, Sali&s;bury and Nottingham; and Man&s;|field I&s;land is &s;ituated in the mouth of the Bay. On the other &s;ide of Hud&s;on's Straits, to the north of Labrador, lies what is called the North-Main, which is bounded on the ea&s;t by Davis's Straits, on the north by Baffin's Bay, and on the we&s;t by a namele&s;s &s;trait.</P>
<P>The country lying round Baffin's Bay goes by the name of Prince William's Land; but we know no|thing more of it. To the &s;outh of Prince Wil|liam's Land lies New North Wales, which has on its

&s;outh New Denmark, and on its we&s;t another land, but both of them unknown. Several i&s;lands lie on the coa&s;t of Labrador, without the Bay: of the&s;e the chief is Newfoundland. The country from Button's Bay &s;outhward and ea&s;tward, as far as La|brador, is called New South-Wales. In Hud&s;on's Bay are a great many le&s;&s;er bays, as James's Bay, Button's Bay, Baffin's Bay, Sir Thomas's Bay, Roe's Bay, Welcome Bay, Wager Bay, Rankin's Inlet, Hope's Bay, Brigg's Bay, Cumberland Bay, Repul&s;e Bay, &amp;c. The chief capes in and about the Bay are Cape Charles, on the Strait of Bellei&s;le, Cape De&s;ire, at the entrance of Hud&s;on's Strait, Cape Henry, Cape James, and Cape Wor&s;enham, near the entrance of Hud&s;on's Bay, Cape Henrietta Maria, Cape Look Out, and Cape Hope, on the we&s;t and &s;outh we&s;t part of the Bay, Cape Dobbs, Cape Com|fort, and Cape A&s;&s;umption, on the north part of the Bay. There are innumerable lakes, bogs, and mora&s;&s;es all over tho&s;e va&s;t tracts lying round the Bay, which being covered with ice and &s;now great part of the year, as well as the mountains, render the air exce&s;&s;ive cold, e&s;pecially when the wind &s;its north-we&s;t. It &s;eems to be as cold in fifty-two de|grees of north latitude on the we&s;tern continent, as it is on the ea&s;tern in &s;ixty-two. A great many rivers fall into the Bay, particularly on the we&s;t and &s;outh &s;ides, as Churchill River, Nel&s;on's River, New Se|vern River, Albany River, and Moo&s;e River. Nel|&s;on's river is the large&s;t and fine&s;t in the Bay; Prince Rupert's and Sluda rivers lie on the ea&s;t &s;ide of the Bay. There are forts and factories at the mouths of all the rivers, except Prince Rupert's and New Severn River.</P>
<P>The ea&s;tern &s;hores of this country were fir&s;t di&s;|covered by Seba&s;tian Cabot, for Henry VII. king of England, in the year 1498. They were after|wards vi&s;ited by Davis, and other Briti&s;h mariners. Mr. Hud&s;on made four voyages thither, between
<PB N="248" REF="2470">
the years 1607 and 1611; in the la&s;t of which, his men forced him and eight more into a boat, and left them to &s;tarve in the bottom of the Bay, and they were never heard of more.</P>
<P>Sir Thomas Button pur&s;ued the di&s;covery in 1612, and captain James in 1631, in hopes of finding a north-we&s;t pa&s;&s;age to China. Captain Gilham &s;ailed to the bottom of the Bay in 1667, and at his return his owners procured a patent for planting this country. The fir&s;t Engli&s;h gover|nor who went thither was Charles Batley, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> who built a fort on Rupert River, calling it Charles Fort, and &s;oon after &s;ettled another factory at Nel|&s;on River. In the year 1684, the chief Engli&s;h factory was at Albany River, with a fort erected for its defence. The French invaded our &s;ettlements, and took Fort Rupert and Albany, in July 1686, though we were then at peace with France; but in king William's war, in 1693, the Engli&s;h recover|ed their &s;ettlements again. During the war in queen Anne's reign, the French reduced all our &s;ettlements, except Albany; but were obliged to re&s;tore them again at the peace of Utrecht, and the company have remained in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of them ever &s;ince; and now, that we are ma&s;ters of all Ca|nada, they have nothing to apprehend from that quarter.</P>
<P>To convince our readers of what we advanced above concerning the gains of the company, and there u&s;age of the Indians, we &s;hall here in&s;ert the &s;tandard or regulation formerly pre&s;cribed by them for their goods bartered on the &s;outhern part of the Bay. Guns, one with another, ten good &s;kins, that is, winter-beaver; twelve &s;kins for the bigge&s;t &s;ort, ten for the mean, and eight for the &s;malle&s;t: pow|der, a beaver for half a pound: &s;hot, a beaver for four pounds: hatchets, a beaver for a great and &s;mall one: knives, a beaver for &s;ix great ones, or

eight jack-knives: beads, a beaver for half a pound: laced coats, &s;ix beavers for a good one: plain coats, five beavers for a red one: coats for women laced, two yards, &s;ix beavers: coats for women plain, five beavers: tobacco, a beaver for one pound: powder-horns, a beaver for a large one and two &s;mall ones: kettles, a beaver for eve|ry pound: and looking-gla&s;&s;es and combs, two beavers.</P>
<P>It is &s;aid, that the annual exports, before the late peace, were only about three thou&s;and pounds value, and their half-yearly &s;ales about twenty-five thou&s;and pounds. They were then &s;uppo&s;ed to be at the charge of one hundred and twenty &s;ervants a year, and about an hundred and twenty men on board the two or three annual &s;hips, which they &s;ent to the bay. Their imports are deer-&s;kins, ca&s;|torum or beaver-&s;tone, feathers, whale bone, and blubber; but beaver-&s;kin is two thirds of the whole. The beaver-&s;kins are worth from three &s;hillings and &s;ixpence to five or &s;ix &s;hillings a pound.</P>

<HEAD>CANADA.</HEAD>
<P>This country, of which the Briti&s;h arms made an entire conque&s;t in the late war, is bounded on the north by New-Britain; on the ea&s;t by New-Scotland, New-England, and New-York; on the &s;outh by the Apalachian and Cherokee mountains, or the Great Lakes; and by unknown lands on the we&s;t.</P>
<P>The country being exten&s;ive, the climate and &s;oil cannot but be very various. All that part now inhabited by the French and Engli&s;h, and which lies mo&s;tly along the great river St. Laurence, is, generally &s;peaking, exce&s;&s;ive cold in winter, though hot in &s;ummer, as mo&s;t of tho&s;e American tracts are that do not lie too far to the northward. The
<PB N="250" REF="2490">
re&s;t of the country, as far as it is known, is full of large woods, mar&s;hes, lakes, mountains, and rivers, which render it &s;till colder. The lands, however, e&s;pecially in the interior parts, and about the lakes and rivers, are &s;aid to be generally fertile, and capable of producing wheat, barley, rye, with many other &s;orts of grain, fruits, and vegeta|bles; tobacco, in particular, thrives exceedingly, and is much cultivated. Here are plenty of &s;tags, elks, deer, bears, foxes, martens, wild cats, ferrets, wea&s;els, &s;quirrels of a large &s;ize and greyi&s;h hue, hares, and rabbits. The &s;outhern parts al&s;o breed great numbers of wild bulls, deer of a &s;mall &s;ize, divers &s;orts of roebucks, goats, wolves, &amp;c. The mar&s;hes, lakes, and pools, &s;warm with otters, beavers, or ca&s;tors, of which the white are highly valued, be|ing &s;carce, as well as the right black kind. The beaver of Canada is an amphibious quadruped, which could live out of the water, if it had convenient bathing places. They are generally not quite four feet in length. Their colours are different, black, brown, white, yellow, and &s;traw-colour; but it is ob&s;erved, that the lighter their colour, the le&s;s quantity of fur they are cloathed with, and live in warmer climates. The fle&s;h of the beaver is a mo&s;t delicious food, when it is parboiled, to take away a di&s;agreeable reli&s;h which it has naturally. Be&s;ides the fur, the beaver produces the true ca&s;to|reum, which is contained in bags in the lower part of the belly, different from the te&s;ticles: the value of this drug is well known. The furs of the beaver are of two kinds, the dry and the green; the dry fur is the &s;kin before it is applied to any u&s;e; the green are the furs that are worn, after being &s;ewed to one another, by the Indians, who be&s;mear them with unctuous &s;ub&s;tances, which not only render them more pliable, but give the fine down, that is manufactured into hats, that oily qua|lity
<PB N="251" REF="2500">
which renders it proper to be worked up with the dry fur. Both the Dutch and Engli&s;h, &s;ince Charlevoix wrote, have found the &s;ecret of making excellent cloths, gloves, and &s;tockings, as well as hats, from the beaver-fur. The mu&s;k rat is a di|minutive kind of beaver, which it re&s;embles in every thing but its tail, which is like that of a common European rat, and its te&s;ticles afford a very &s;trong mu&s;k. The elk is of the &s;ize of a hor&s;e or mule; its feet and legs re&s;emble tho&s;e of a &s;tag's, its neck and withers are covered with long hair, and it has a head about two feet long. His antlers re&s;emble tho&s;e of a doe. Many extraordinary me|dicinal qualities, particularly for curing the falling|&s;ickne&s;s, are a&s;cribed to the hoof of the left foot of this animal. Its fle&s;h is very agreeable and nou|ri&s;hing, and its colour a mixture of light grey and dark red. They love the cold countries; and when the winter affords them no gra&s;s, they gnaw the bark of trees. There is a carnivorous animal here, called the carcajou, of the feline or cat kind, with a tail &s;o long that Charlevoix &s;ays, that he has twi&s;ted it &s;everal times round his body. Its body is about two feet in length, from the end of the &s;nout to the tail. It is &s;aid, that this animal, winding him&s;elf about a tree, will dart from thence upon the elk, twi&s;t his &s;trong tail round his body, and cut his throat in a moment. The buffaloe of Canada is much larger than that of Europe; but their appearance is much alike. His body is covered with a black wool, which is highly e&s;teemed. The fle&s;h of the female is very good; and the buffaloe hides are as &s;oft and pliable as Chamois leather, but &s;o very &s;trong, that the bucklers which the Indians make u&s;e of are hard|ly penetrable by a mu&s;ket ball. The Canadian roebuck is a dome&s;tic animal, but differs in no other re&s;pect from tho&s;e of Europe. Wolves are
<PB N="252" REF="2510">
&s;carce in Canada, but they afford the fine&s;t furs in all the country: their fle&s;h is white, and good to eat, and they pur&s;ue their prey to the tops of the talle&s;t trees. The black foxes are greatly e&s;teemed, and very &s;carce; but tho&s;e of other co+lours are more common; and &s;ome on the Upper Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi are of a &s;ilver colour, and very beautiful. They live upon water-fowls, which they decoy within their clutches by a thou&s;and antic tricks, and then &s;pring upon them, and devour them. The Canadian poll-cat has a mo&s;t beautiful white fur, except the tip of his tail, which is as black as jet. When pur&s;ued, he lets fly his urine, which, it is &s;aid, infects the air for a quarter of a league round; for which rea&s;on, he is called by the inhabitants the devil's brat, or the &s;tinkard. Charlevoix &s;ays, the common marten's &s;kin is worth a crown, and the brown ones &s;even &s;hillings. The Canadian wood-rat is of a beautiful &s;ilver colour, with a bu&s;hy tail, and as big again as the European: the female carries under her belly a bag, which &s;he opens and &s;huts at plea&s;ure; and in that &s;he places her young, when pur&s;ued. There are three &s;orts of &s;quirrels: that called the flying &s;quirrel will leap forty paces and more, from one tree to ano|ther. This little animal is ea&s;ily tamed, and is very lively, except when a&s;leep, which is often the ca&s;e; and he puts up wherever he can find a place, in one's &s;leeve, pocket, or muff: he fir&s;t pitches on his ma&s;ter, whom he will di&s;tingui&s;h among&s;t twenty per&s;ons. The Canadian porcupine is le&s;s than a middling dog: when roa&s;ted, he eats full as well as a &s;ucking pig. The hares and rabbits differ little from tho&s;e in Europe, only they turn grey in winter. There are two &s;orts of bears here; one of a reddi&s;h, and the other of a black co|lour; but the former is the mo&s;t dangerous. Some
<PB N="253" REF="2520">
of the rivers breed a kind of crocodile, that differs but little from tho&s;e of the Nile.</P>
<P>The meadow-grounds in Canada, which are well watered, yield excellent gra&s;s, and breed va&s;t num|bers of great and &s;mall cattle: and where the ara|ble land is well manured, it produces rich crops. The mountains abound with coal-mines, and &s;ome, we are told, with &s;ilver and other metals; though we have not heard of any great advantage made of them as yet.</P>
<P>The lakes are both large and numerous: the prin|cipal are Lake Superior, Michigan, tho&s;e of the Illinois and Hurons, Lake Erie, Lake Ontario, Frontenac, or O&s;wego, Lake Champlain, and Ti|mi&s;caining, be&s;ides others of a &s;maller &s;ize. Lake Superior, or the Upper Lake, which is &s;ituated the farthe&s;t north, is reckoned one hundred leagues in length, and about &s;eventy where broade&s;t, and hath &s;everal con&s;iderable i&s;lands in it; the chief of which are, the Royal I&s;le, Pont Chartrain, Mau|repas, St. Anne, St. Ignatius, Hoequart, and Mi|nong. A con&s;iderable trade is now carried on by barks and canoes through &s;ome of the&s;e lakes, par|ticularly Ontario, Erie, and Champlain, mo&s;t of the forts being &s;ituated on them.</P>
<P>The whole country abounds with large rivers, which it would be endle&s;s to enter into a detail of; the principal are tho&s;e of St. Laurence, the Out|tauais, St. John's, Seguinay, D&eacute;&s;prairies, and Trois-Rivieres. You enter the bay of St. Laurence be|tween Cape de Retz, on the i&s;land of Newfound|land, and the North Cape, on that called the Royal I&s;land, or more commonly Cape Breton. After doubling Cape Ro&s;e, or Ro&s;ieres, you enter the ri|ver, which runs north-ea&s;t and &s;outh-we&s;t. At the mouth of the river the cold is inten&s;e, and the &s;ea boi&s;terous. The river it&s;elf, at its opening, is about thirty leagues in breadth; and towards the &s;outh lie the bay and point of Ga&s;pey. Below this
<PB N="254" REF="2530">
bay is a &s;teep rock, which has obtained the name of the Bored I&s;land, from an aperture in its middle, through which a &s;loop may pa&s;s with her &s;ails up. At a leagues di&s;tance from the Bored I&s;land lies the i&s;land Bonaventure; and at a league di&s;tance from that the i&s;land Mi&s;con, which has an excellent har|bour, and is eight leagues in circumference. A &s;prin of fre&s;h water &s;pouts up to a con&s;iderable height in the offing, not far from this i&s;land. The next object that pre&s;ents it&s;elf in the river St. Law|rence is the i&s;land Antico&s;ti; and the current &s;et|ting &s;trongly in upon it, renders the navigation here extremely dangerous, in ca&s;e of a calm, e&s;pe|cially as the i&s;land is lined with breakers. This i&s;land is narrow; but lies in the middle of the river, and extends about forty leagues, from narth-ea&s;t to &s;outh-we&s;t. The French have repre|&s;ented it as ab&s;olutely good for nothing: its coa&s;ts, however, are well &s;tored with fi&s;h. After pa&s;&s;ing this i&s;land, the navigation becomes more tolerable; but &s;till great precaution mu&s;t be u&s;ed. The mounts Notre Dame and Lewis lie on the larboard &s;ide: near the latter are &s;ome French plantations. The next point is Trinity Point, which mu&s;t be avoided with great care. A little higher are the Paps of Montani, &s;o called from the appearance of the mountain, &s;ituated about two leagues from the &s;hore. The land in the neighbourhood is &s;aid to be not only unprofitable, but frightful; be|ing covered with rocks, &s;ands, and impenetrable thickets: it contains, however, plenty of game. On the other &s;ide the river, and advancing two leagues into its bed, lies the &s;hoal of Mani|couagu, which is the mo&s;t dangerous in the river: it is named from a river that falls from the mountains of Labrador, and otherwi&s;e called the river of St. Barnabas, and the Black River. From this to Green I&s;land the navigation is
<PB N="255" REF="2540">
&s;low and uncertain, and the &s;hores uncomfortable and uninhabited. Somewhat higher lies the river Saguenay, which carries &s;hips twenty-five leagues above its mouth, where is an excellent harbour, called Tadou&s;&s;ac; in &s;ailing from which, great care mu&s;t be taken to avoid the Red I&s;land, which is a dangerous rock of that colour, who&s;e &s;urface is equal to the water, and often proves fatal to &s;hipping. About fifteen leagues di&s;tance, that is, midway between Quebec and Tadou&s;&s;ac, lies the i&s;le of Coudres, where the pa&s;&s;age of the river is dangerous, without a fair wind; in particular, there is a whirlpool, that mu&s;t be carefully guard|ed again&s;t. Next appears the Bay of St. Paul, where the plantations on the north &s;hore be|gin: they con&s;i&s;t of valuable woods of pine-trees, among which are red pines, which are e&s;teem|ed very beautiful; here likewi&s;e is a fine lead mine. About &s;ix leagues above this is a very high promontory, which terminates a chain of moun|tains that reach above four hundred leagues to the we&s;tward, and is called Cape Torment: round the anchoring place here lie a number of i&s;lands, a|mong which is that of Orleans, which forms a mo&s;t beautiful pro&s;pect. It is about fourteen leagues in circumference, and populous, as pro|ducing excellent wheat, and fine fruits. It forms two channels, of which the &s;outh is the mo&s;t navi|gable: here the water becomes drinkable; for it is bracki&s;h at Cape Torment, though it is an hun|dred and ten leagues from the &s;ea. The higher up the river, the flux of the tide dimini&s;hes, and the reflux increa&s;es, and twenty leagues above Quebec the tide is not perceptible; but indeed the tides in this river, as well as the currents, vary greatly, according to the &s;ea&s;ons, and the po&s;itions of the lands. It is very large and deep, and con|tains
<PB N="256" REF="2550">
&s;everal i&s;lands, all the way from Quebec to Lake Ontario, whence it i&s;&s;ues.</P>
<P>Of the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi we &s;hall give &s;ome account, when we come to Loui&s;iana, to which it more pro|perly belongs, and of which the greater part is now included in the province of We&s;t Florida.</P>
<P>Father Charlevoix is of opinion, that the Cana|dian fi&s;hery, if properly improved, would be more likely to enrich that country than the fur trade. Be&s;ides a great variety of other fi&s;h in the lakes and rivers, particularly that of St. Lawrence, are &s;ea|wolves, &s;ea-cows, porpoi&s;es, the lencornet, the go|berque, the &s;ea plai&s;e, &s;almon trouts, turtles, lob&s;|ters, the chaoura&s;ou, &s;turgeon, the achigau, and the gilthead. The &s;ea-wolf, &s;o called from its howl|ing, is an amphibious creature. His head re&s;em|bles that of a dog: he has four very &s;hort legs, of which the fore ones have nails; but the hind ones terminate in fins. The large&s;t are &s;aid to weigh two thou&s;and pounds, and are of different colours. Their fle&s;h is good eating; but the profit of it lies in its oil, which is proper for burning, and currying of leather. Their &s;kins make excellent coverings for trunks, and though not &s;o fine as Morocco lea|ther, they pre&s;erve their fre&s;hne&s;s better, and are le&s;s liable to cracks. The &s;hoes and boots made of tho&s;e &s;kins let in no water, and, when properly tanned, make excellent and la&s;ting covers for &s;eats. The Canadian &s;ea-cow is larger than the &s;ea-wolf, but re&s;embles it in figure. It has two teeth of the thickne&s;s and length of a man's arm, that, when grown, look like horns, and are very fine ivory, as well as its other teeth. Some of the porpoi&s;es of the river St. Lawrence are &s;aid to yield a hog&s;head of oil, and of their &s;kins are made wai&s;tcoats, which are exce&s;&s;ively &s;trong, and mu&s;ket-proof. The lencornet is a kind of cuttle fi&s;h, quite round,
<PB N="257" REF="2560">
or rather oval: there are two &s;orts of them, which differ only in &s;ize; &s;ome being as large as a hog&s;|head, and others but a foot long: they catch only the la&s;t, and that with a torch: they are excellent eating, roa&s;ted, boiled, or frica&s;ied; but they make the &s;auce quite black. The goberque has the ta&s;te and &s;mell of a &s;mall cod. The &s;&egrave;a-plai&s;e is excellent eating; and they are taken with long poles, armed with iron hooks. The chaoura&s;ou is an armed fi&s;h, re&s;embling a pike; but is covered with &s;cales, that are proof again&s;t a dagger: &s;ome of them are above five feet long, and about the thickne&s;s of a man's thigh: this fi&s;h is &s;aid even to catch and devour birds; in order to which, he con|ceals him&s;elf among the canes or reeds, in &s;uch a manner that nothing is to be &s;een be&s;ides his weapon, which he holds, rai&s;ed perpendicularly, above the &s;urface of the water: the fowls, which come to take re&s;t, imagining the weapon to be only a withered reed, make no &s;cruple of perching upon it; but they are no &s;ooner alighted, than the fi&s;h opens his throat, and &s;o &s;uddenly makes at his prey, that it rarely e&s;capes. The Indians pretend their teeth are a &s;overign remedy again&s;t the tooth ach, and that, by pricking the part mo&s;t affected with one of them, the pain in&s;tantly vani&s;hes. The &s;tur|geon is both a fre&s;h and &s;alt-water fi&s;h, from eight to twelve feet long, and proportionably thick: the &s;malle&s;t have a fle&s;h of a mo&s;t delicate grain, and are excellent eating. The achigau, and the gilt-head, are fi&s;h peculiar to the river St. Law|rence.</P>
<P>The fore&s;ts of Canada are not &s;o well &s;tocked with birds as its rivers are with fi&s;hes. They con|tain two kinds of eagles; the large&s;t of which have a white head and neck, and prey upon hares and rabbits, which they carry up to their ne&s;ts; but
<PB N="258" REF="2570">
the other are grey, and prey on birds and fi&s;hes. The falcons, go&s;hawks, tercels, are the &s;ame as in Eu|rope: the partridges are grey, red, and black, with long tails, which they &s;pread out as a fan, like a turkey-cock, and make a very beautiful appear|ance. Woodcocks are very &s;carce in Canada; but &s;nipes, and other water-game, are plentiful. A Canadian raven is &s;aid by &s;ome writers to eat as well as a pullet, and an owl better. Blackbirds and &s;wallows are birds of pa&s;&s;age here, as well as in Europe, and three kinds of larks are found here, one &s;pecies little different from European ones. No fewer than twenty two different &s;pecies of ducks are to be met with in Canada; and a great number of &s;wans, turkeys, gee&s;e, bu&s;tards, teal, water-hens, cranes, and other large water-fowl; but always at a di&s;tance from hou&s;es. The cranes, of which &s;ome are white, and light grey, are &s;aid to make excellent &s;oup. The Canadian wood-pecker is a beautiful bird. The thru&s;hes and gold-finches here differ little from tho&s;e of Europe. The chief Canadian bird of melody is the white-bird, which is a kind of ortelan, very &s;hewy, and remarkable for announcing the return of &s;pring. The fly-bird is thought to be the mo&s;t beautiful of any in na|ture; with all his plumage, he is no bigger than a cock chafer, and he makes a noi&s;e with his wings like the humming of a large fly: his legs are like two needles, and from his bill, which is of the &s;ame thickne&s;s, a &s;mall &s;ting proceeds, with which he pierces the flowers, and thereby nou|ri&s;hes him&s;elf with the &s;ap: the female has nothing &s;triking in its appearance; but the male is a perfect jewel, having on his head a &s;mall tuft of the mo&s;t beautiful black, his brea&s;t red, his belly white, his back, wings, and tail green, like that of a ro&s;e-bu&s;h; &s;pecks of gold &s;cat|tered all over the plumage, add greatly to its beauty; and an imperceptible down produces the
<PB N="259" REF="2580">
mo&s;t delightful &s;hadings that can be imagined Rattle-&s;nakes are found in Canada, &s;ome of them as thick or thicker than a man's leg: when he moves, his tail, which is covered with rows of &s;cales, rattles, whence he has his name. His bite is mor|tal, but an herb grows wherever this reptile is found in this country, called the rattle-&s;nake's-plant, which is an infallible antidote to the poi&s;on of his bite, by chewing it, and applying it in the nature of a plai&s;ter to the wound. The rattle-&s;nake &s;eldom bites pa&s;&s;engers, unle&s;s he is provoked or trod upon. The Indians, however, pur&s;ue them, and greatly prize their fle&s;h, which they eat.</P>
<P>The fore&s;ts of Canada pre&s;ent a mo&s;t beau|tiful and awful appearance, and contain va&s;t variety of trees, among which are two &s;orts of pines, the white and the red; four &s;orts of firs; two &s;orts of cedar and oak, the white and the red; the male and female maple; three &s;orts of a&s;h-trees, the free, the mungrel, and the ba&s;tard; three &s;orts of walnut-trees, the hard, the &s;oft, and the &s;mooth; va&s;t numbers of beech trees, and white wood; white and red elms; and poplars. The Iroquois hollow the red elms into canoes, &s;ome of which, made out of one piece, will con|tain twenty per&s;ons. About November the bears and wild cats take up their habitations in the hol|low elms, and remain there till April. Here are al&s;o found cherry-trees; plumb-trees; the vine|gar tree, the fruit of which, being infu&s;ed in wa|ter, produces vinegar; an aquatic plant, called atoca, the fruit of which may be made into a con|fection; the white thorn; the cotton-tree, on the top of which grow &s;everal tufts of flowers, which, when &s;haken in the morning, before the dew falls off, produce honey that may be boiled up into &s;u|gar, the &s;eed being a pod, containing a very fine kind of cotton; the &s;un-plant, which re&s;embles a marigold, and grows to the height of &s;even or

<P>Canada, while po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the French, exclu&s;ive of Loui&s;iana, was divided into the provinces of Canada Proper, and Sanguenay; the former of which, lying towards the &s;outh-we&s;t, was &s;ubdi+vided into thirteen di&s;tricts; and the latter, lying towards the north ea&s;t, into &s;ix; all, or mo&s;t of them, taking their names from the principal &s;ettle+ments or forts in them.</P>
<P>Canada Proper, before the late war, was &s;aid to be inhabited by an hundred and eighty thou&s;and French, who lived in affluence, being free from all taxes, and having full liberty to hunt, fi&s;h, fel+timber for fuel or building, and to &s;ow and plan as much land as they could cultivate. Their great hard&s;hip was the winter cold, which is there &s;$ exce&s;&s;ive from December to April, that the greate&s;$ rivers are frozen over, and the &s;now lies common+ly two or three feet deep on the ground, though I extends no farther north than 48&deg;. of latitude.</P>
<P>The principal places in this province are Mon+treal and Trois Rivieres.</P>
<P>The former &s;tands on an i&s;land in the river S$ Laurence, which is ten leagues in length, and al+mo&s;t four in breadth, at the foot of a mountain which gives name to it, about half a league from the &s;outh &s;hore. While the French were in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Canada, both the city and i&s;land of Montre belonged to private proprietors, who had im+proved them &s;o well, that the whole i&s;land we become a mo&s;t delightful &s;pot, and produce every thing that could admini&s;ter to the con+veniencies of life. The town, &s;ince it hath been in the hands of the Engli&s;h, hath &s;uffered ex+tremely by fires. When reduced by general An her&s;t, it was of an oblong form, well peoples
<PB N="261" REF="2600">
and &s;urrounded by a wall, flanked with eleven re|doubts, which &s;erved in&s;tead of ba&s;tions. The &s;treets were well laid out, and the hou&s;es built in a very hand&s;ome manner. The ditch was about eight feet deep, and of a proportionable breadth, but dry. Here was al&s;o a fort or citadel, the bat|teries of which commanded the &s;treets of the town, from one &s;ide of it to the other. The&s;e fortifications have been much improved by the Engli&s;h. The town it&s;elf is divided into two parts, the upper and the lower; in the la&s;t the merchants and men of bu&s;ine&s;s generally re&s;ide. Here likewi&s;e, before the peace, was the place of arms, the royal magazines, and the nunnery ho&s;pital. The upper town, howe|ver, contained the principal buildings; &s;uch as the palace of the governor, the hou&s;es of the chief of|ficers, the convent of Recollects, the Je&s;uit's church and &s;eminary, the free-&s;chool, and the pari&s;h church. The governor's palace is a large fine building. Be|&s;ides a general ho&s;pital, the neighbourhood of this city contains many elegant villas; and all the ve|getables of Europe grow in it. In &s;hort, when it fell into the hands of the Engli&s;h, all the banks of the river from thence to Quebec, were but one continued village, adorned with fine plantations, and gentlemen's &s;eats at proper di&s;tances. The inland trade of this town and the re&s;t of Canada, while they were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the French, were with the Indian natives: they &s;ent to the We&s;t-Indies racoon, fox, and beaver fur, &s;kins of deer, and other branches of the peltry trade; and Indian corn, with what they call lumber, or wood. Their wine, brandy, cloth, linen, and wrought iron, came from Europe; and the native Indians took from them toys and trinkets of all kinds, duffil blankets, guns, powder, ball, kettles, hatchets, tomohawks, $randy, and tobacco. There was then a &s;pecies of $aders called coureurs des bois, who carried on a
<PB N="262" REF="2610">
trade with rations unknown to all the world be&s;ides, In June a fair was held at Montreal, to which In|dians re&s;orted from the di&s;tance of a thou&s;and miles, with peltry, and other Indian commodities; and the French from all parts of Canada. This fair &s;ometimes la&s;ted for three months. The re&s;ort of &s;avage nations to it was incredible; and great di&s;|orders and tumults often happened; the Indians being &s;o fond of brandy, that they &s;ometimes for a dram gave the coureurs des bois all they had in the world. In the neighbourhood of the i&s;land, on which the town &s;tands, is a great number of others, particularly that called the I&s;le of Je&s;us, which is about eight leagues in length, and two in breadth. There are al&s;o &s;everal lakes; among others that of St. Louis, and that formed by the opening of the river des Outaouais, or the Great River, into the river St. Laurence. On the banks of the la&s;t of the&s;e rivers likewi&s;e, not far from Mon|treal, are two villages of Iroquois Chri&s;tians; one called Sault St. Louis, and the other La Montaigne.</P>
<P>The town called Trois Rivieres, or the Three Rivers, has its name from three rivers, which join their currents about a quarter of a mile below it, and fall into the great one of St. Laurence. It is much re&s;orted to by &s;everal nations that come down tho&s;e rivers to it, and trade with it in various kinds of furs; and the country about it is plea&s;ant, and fertile in corn, fruits, &amp;c. A great number of hand&s;ome hou&s;es &s;tand on both &s;ides the rivers. This town gives name to a di&s;trict, and &s;tands about thirty leagues up the river St. Laurence from Quebec.</P>
<P>The other places of mo&s;t note in this province are Ga&s;p&eacute;, St. Jean I&s;le, Mi&s;cou I&s;le, Richelieu I&s;les, I&s;le Conti, St. Francois, Notre Dame des Ang$s, St. Alexis, St. Michael, St. Jo&s;eph, Forts Frontenac, Niagara, near which is the famous fall, Fort Detroit, Michilachimenac, and many others.</P>

The province of Seguinay takes its name from the river &s;o called, which i&s;&s;ues from the lake of St. John, and falls into that of St. Laurence at Ta|dou&s;&s;ae, about thirty leagues below Quebec. This river is the boundary of the province on that &s;ide.</P>
<P>Quebec, the capital, not only of this province but of all Canada, and an epi&s;copal &s;ee, is &s;ituated at the confluence of the rivers St. Lawrence and St. Charles, or the Little River; and on the north &s;ide of the former, near Cape Diamond, about one hundred and forty leagues from the &s;ea, or from Cape Ro&s;e or Ro&s;ieres. The river St. Lawrence here is not above a mile in breadth, though not le&s;s than four or five leagues between it and the I&s;le of Orleans. It is built on a rock, partly of marble and partly of &s;late. The haven, which lies oppo&s;ite the town, is &s;afe and commodious, and about five fathom deep. Before the city was taken by the Engli&s;h, it is &s;aid to have made a ve|ry fine appearance. Among the principal edifices were, the epi&s;copal palace; the cathedral; the fort or citadel, which was the re&s;idence of the governor-ge|neral; the hou&s;e and church of the Recollects; the church of the Ur&s;eline nuns, in which is the tomb of Mon&s;ieur Montcalm, who commanded the French, and was killed at the battle of Quebec, in which al&s;o fell that young hero Wolfe, who commanded the Engli&s;h; the &s;umptuous college of the Je&s;uits; the intendant's hou&s;e, the king's magazines, &amp;c. The city is divided into the upper and lower, and was well fortified when the Engli&s;h laid &s;iege to it. The fort or citadel &s;tands on the brink of the rock, and is a fine work: a pretty large e&s;pla|nade, and a gentle declivity, the whole making a very fine platform, lies between the fort and the &s;ummit of Cape Diamond. About half a quar|ter of a league towards the country lies the Ho&s;pi|tal-General, which is the fine&s;t hou&s;e in all Canada.
<PB N="$64" REF="2630">
The harbour is flanked by two ba&s;tions, that are rai&s;ed twenty-five feet from the ground, which is about the height of the tides at the time of the equinox. In &s;hort, the fortifications of Quebec, at the time it was taken by the Engli&s;h, were as complete as the be&s;t engineers in the world could render them; and if it had not been for the amazing good fortune, and the more amazing in|trepidity, of the Briti&s;h troops, they might have bid defiance to all the power of Europe. When Charlevoix was at Quebec, he reckoned the inha|bitants not to exceed &s;even thou&s;and; but they were certainly above double that number, when it was conquered by the Engli&s;h.</P>
<P>About three leagues from Quebec, before the war, was a mo&s;t awful place of retirement, which excited in all who approached it, &s;entiments of reverence and &s;acred horror, which were more increa&s;ed by the company of its inhabitants, who were Hurons, or wild Indians, converted to Chri&s;|tianity, &s;imple in their manners, and fervid in their devotions, though of a tribe the fierce&s;t and mo&s;t untractable of all the American &s;a|vages. They had a chapel built upon the &s;ame model as that of the famous holy hou&s;e of Lo|retto in Italy, and therefore it was called the Huron village of Loretto. Between Quebec and Mon|treal, in &s;ailing up the river St. Laurence, the eye is entertained with beautiful land&s;capes, the banks being in many places very bold and &s;teep, and &s;haded with lofty trees, and in others crowd|ed with villages, of which there are al&s;o many on the i&s;lands, wherewith the channel of the river is in|ter&s;per&s;ed. After pa&s;&s;ing the Richlieu i&s;lands, the air becomes &s;o mild and temperate, that the travel|ler thinks him&s;elf tran&s;ported into another climate. Of the other places in this province, the mo&s;t con|&s;iderable are Silleri, Tadou&s;&s;ac, Port-Neuf, Beau-Port,
<PB N="26$" REF="2640">
St. Anne, St. Nicholas, Port-Cartier, Che|cheque dec and Necouba.</P>
<P>The different tribes of Indians in Canada are al|mo&s;t innumerable. It is not our intention, nor indeed in our power, to trace out all the&s;e; many of them are hardly known, even by name, to Eu|ropeans. Some of them, mentioned in the mo&s;t early accounts, are now not to be found; for tho&s;e barbarians often carry on wars to the extermina|tion of one another. The mo&s;t con&s;iderable tribes at pre&s;ent are, the Iroquois, the Hurons, Miamis, Nokes, Oumamis, Outagamis, Sakis, Illinois, Ou|baches, Otters or Loutres, Savannois, Sioux, A&s;&s;ini|boils, and Chri&s;tinaux. The la&s;t &s;even live to|wards the north-we&s;t, about the rivers Mi&s;&s;ouri and Oubache, and about Lake Superior, and A&s;&s;ini|boil. To the north of the i&s;land of Montreal the country is thinly peopled; but a few villages be|longing to the old inhabitants are to be met with, among which are tho&s;e belonging to the Nepi&s;|&s;ings, &s;o called from a lake of that name, who are the true de&s;cendants of the Algonquins, and &s;till pre&s;erve the purity of that language. The French e&s;tabli&s;hed &s;ome ports on the banks of Lake Supe|rior, where they traded with the Chri&s;tinaux and A&s;&s;iniboils. In &s;hort, a traveller can know very little more of this country than a man may learn by an in&s;pection of the map. He may wander one thou&s;and miles on the banks of the fine&s;t lakes and rivers in the world, without meeting with a human creature; and tho&s;e he does meet with are generally &s;o &s;tupid, &s;o cruel, &s;o barbarous, or &s;hy, that they &s;carcely de&s;erve that denomination. Mo&s;t of them appear to be void of all notions of agriculture, and &s;ub&s;i&s;t by fi&s;hing and hunting; and they daily decrea&s;e in populou&s;ne&s;s, though they commonly allow them&s;elves a plurality of wives: few of their tribes contain above &s;ix thou&s;and
<PB N="266" REF="2650">
&s;ouls, and many of them, not two thou&s;and. The&s;e barbarians are cloathed chiefly with &s;kins, but in different forms: tho&s;e who are mo&s;t admired and e&s;teemed among them, and con&s;equently have the greate&s;t authority, are &s;uch as di&s;tingui&s;h them&s;elves either as hunters or warriors. They are all very &s;u|per&s;titious, mo&s;t of them having confu&s;ed notions of a good and evil genius, and believing the &s;un to be the great Divinity of the world. Many of them al&s;o believe tran&s;migration, and that the decea&s;ed are fond of the &s;ame exerci&s;es and enjoyments in the other world that gave them delight in this.</P>
<P>In all the va&s;t extent of Canada, there are but three radical or mother tongues, the Siou&s;e, the Algonquin, and Huron. As to the fir&s;t, it is impo&s;&s;ible to &s;ay, how far it extends; and neither French nor Engli&s;h are much acquainted with tho&s;e who &s;peak it. By an acquaintance with the other two, a man may travel fifteen hundred leagues in this country without an interpreter; for though he may vi&s;it above a hundred different nations, each of which has a particular idiom, yet he can make him&s;elf under&s;tood by all; even among the Indians of New England and Virginia. The Siou&s;e, as far as the Europeans are acquainted with it, is rather a hi&s;&s;ing than an articulation of words; but the Huron language has great energy, pathos, and elevation, and the Algonquin excels in &s;moothne&s;s and elegance.</P>
<P>By the capitulation granted to the French, when this country was reduced, both individuals and com|munities are intitled to all their former rights and privileges: the Roman Catholic is &s;till to con|tinue the e&s;tabli&s;hed religion, but the king of Great-Britain &s;ucceeds to all the powers and prerogatives of which his mo&s;t Chri&s;tian maje&s;ty was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed. Since Canada became a colony of Great Britain, it
<PB N="276" REF="2660">
has been divided into the three governments of Quebec, Montreal, and Trois Rivieres.</P>
<P>The French, before the late war broke out, it is &s;aid, imported from Canada, including Loui&s;iana, in beaver, &s;eventy-five thou&s;and pounds; in other furs, forty thou&s;and pounds; in deer &s;kins, twenty thou&s;and pounds; total a hundred and thirty-five thou&s;and pounds; while the Engli&s;h, in the &s;ame articles, imported only to the amount of about ninety thou&s;and pounds.</P>

<HEAD>NOVA SCOTIA.</HEAD>
<P>Nova Scotia, or New Scotland, by the French called Acadie, is bounded by the Bay of St. Law|rence and the Atlantic Ocean to the ea&s;t; by the &s;ame ocean, and New England to the &s;outh; by the River St. Lawrence, on the north; and by Canada on the we&s;t; being computed to be five hundred miles in length, and four hundred in breadth. It had the name of Nova Scotia from Sir William Alexander, a Scotchman, and &s;ecre|tary to king James I. who had the fir&s;t grant of lands in it.</P>
<P>By the twelfth article of the treaty of Utrecht, all the province of Nova Scotia, or L'Acadie, with all its antient boundaries; al&s;o the city of Port-Royale, now called Annapolis Royal, with all its dependencies in lands, i&s;lands, and other par|ticulars, together with the dominion, property, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the &s;aid i&s;lands, lands, and other rights, by treaty or otherwi&s;e obtained, was ceded in per|petuity to the crown of Great-Britain. To this was &s;ubjoined an exclu&s;ion of the &s;ubjects of France from fi&s;hing on the coa&s;t of Nova Scotia, or within thirty leagues, beginning from Cape Sable, and &s;tretching along to the &s;outh-we&s;t. A regiment was then &s;ent over to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Annapolis,
<PB N="268" REF="2670">
the capital, but no provi&s;ion was made to plant the re&s;t of Nova-Scotia, till the year 1749, when about three thou&s;and Engli&s;h families, under the command of governor Cornwallis, were &s;ent thi|ther, and erected the town of Halifax, in Che|bucto Bay, and &s;ince that &s;everal other embarka|tions have been made. In the late war, one of the di&s;putes between Great-Britain and France was about the boundaries of Nova-Scotia, which the Briti&s;h commi&s;&s;aries demon&s;trated to extend to the river St. Lawrence on the north, by &s;everal treaties between the two nations: whereas the French in|&s;i&s;ted, that only part of the penin&s;ula was ceded to Great Britain; but it is to be hoped, this di&s;pute hath been finally decided by the event of the la&s;t war. As the French, who were &s;ettled in Nova-Scotia, without regarding the oaths they had taken to the king of Great Britain, had con&s;tantly ad|hered to France, it was thought fit, upon the la&s;t reduction of it, to remove them from thence, and di&s;per&s;e them in the re&s;t of the Briti&s;h plantations.</P>
<P>Writers differ no le&s;s about the quality than the extent of this country; &s;ome de&s;cribing it as &s;carce fit for the re&s;idence of the mo&s;t barbarous &s;avages, while others extol its fertility. Baron La Honton, a French writer of credit, many years re&s;ident in the country, tells us, that it abounds with little rivers, the entrance of which affords anchorage for the large&s;t ve&s;&s;els, that they are full of &s;almon, and that mo&s;t of the gulphs and rivers, with which they communicate, yield great plenty of cod. He further ob&s;erves, that almo&s;t every part of Acadia produces, or is capable of pro|ducing, corn, fruit, pea&s;e, and other pul&s;e; that the four &s;ea&s;ons of the year are ea&s;ily di&s;tingui&s;hed; that the winter is very &s;evere for three months; that the country yields excellent timber for ma&s;ts;
<PB N="269" REF="2680">
and, upon occa&s;ion, for building any kind of &s;hip|ping. The baron al&s;o affirms, that Nova-Scotia is admirable for hunting, and &s;peaks of it, in general, as a fine country, the air pure and &s;alubrious, the climate tolerably moderate, and the water light and pellucid. With this gentleman the intelligent Charlevoix agrees, alledging it abounds with all the nece&s;&s;aries of life, and that the inhabitants may live very comfortably without much fatigue. Here is abundance of feathered game, &s;uch as par|tridges, ducks, teal, widgeons, and bu&s;tard; the latter flock in &s;uch crowds to the banks of the rivers, and all the ponds, in the month of April, that their eggs alone are &s;ufficient to &s;ub&s;i&s;t the inhabitans for that &s;ea&s;on; and yet, notwith&s;tand|ing the extraordinary con&s;umption of the&s;e eggs, it is not perceivable that the &s;pecies is dimini&s;hed. At the clo&s;e of March the fi&s;h begin to &s;pawn, when they enter the rivers in &s;uch &s;hoals as are incredible. Herrings come up in April, and the &s;turgeon and &s;almon in May. Here are al&s;o mul|titudes of deer, beaver, otters, and &s;ome other quadrupeds, highy valued for their furs; and one of the fine&s;t cod fi&s;heries in the world upon the coa&s;t. Though the winters are &s;evere, yet they are very &s;upportable, in con&s;equence of the great plenty of fuel; and as the timber is not only fit for building, but al&s;o yields pitch and tar, and the &s;oil is proper for hemp and flax, all manner of na|val &s;tores may be had here.</P>
<P>A great part of this country con&s;i&s;ts of the penin|&s;ula that is formed by the Bay of Fundy, Chenig|to, and Green Bay; all the coa&s;t of which, from Cape Sable on the we&s;t, to Cape Can&s;o on the ea&s;t, is lined with &s;hoals or &s;ands. Be&s;ides the bays a|bove-mentioned, there is a great number of others all along the coa&s;t, particularly tho&s;e of Ga&s;p&eacute;,

Chaleurs, and Chedibucto, on the north-ea&s;t; the Bay of I&s;lands, Chebucto, and La Here, on the &s;outh; and the Bay of Annapolis on the &s;outh &s;ide of the Bay of Fundy. In the&s;e bays, and other parts of the coa&s;t, are many fine roads and ha|vens. The chief capes are tho&s;e of Ro&s;ieres and Ga&s;p&eacute; on the north-ea&s;t; Capes Portage, Ecou|menac, Tourmentin, Port, Epis, Fogery, and Can|&s;o, on the ea&s;t; Capes Blanco, Vert, Theodore, Dore, la Heve, and Negro, on the &s;outh; Cape Sable, and Cape Fourche, on the &s;outh we&s;t. The rivers and lakes are very numerous. Of the for|mer, the mo&s;t con&s;iderable are tho&s;e of St. John, Pa&s;&s;amagnadi, Penob&s;cot, and St. Croix, which run from north to &s;outh, and fall into the Bay of Fundy; and tho&s;e of Ri&s;gouche, and Nipi&s;iguit, which run from we&s;t to ea&s;t, and fall into the Gulph of St. Laurence, and that of Chebucto, that falls into the Atlantic. Of the latter, tho&s;e called Ke&s;eben and Freneu&s;e are very large; but there are many that have not yet received any particular names. As to the tribes of Indians in Nova-Scotia, the mo&s;t con&s;iderable, or at lea&s;t tho&s;e that are be&s;t known, are the Itchemins, Souriquois, and Mick|macks.</P>
<P>The country is &s;aid to be divided into twelve di&s;tricts, each of which annually elects a deputy, who mu&s;t be approved by the governor and coun|cil. This deputy is regarded as a kind of agent, or &s;ollicitor for the di&s;trict, who reports its &s;itua|tion, from time to time, to the government; but they have not yet, we believe, any legi&s;lative or executive power. The mo&s;t con&s;iderable places in this infant colony are, Halifax, Annapolis, Can&s;o, St. John's, Minnes, and Chenigto.</P>
<P>Halifax is &s;ituated on Chebucto Bay, having a communication with all parts of the province, either by land-carriage, the &s;ea, or navigable ri|vers,

The river Chi|bucto is three miles broad at the town, near which is a &s;mall town called Dartmouth, a Dutch town, with an exten&s;ive common, corn fields, and conve|niencies for drying and curing fi&s;h. The number of the inhabitants is &s;aid to be about ten or twelve thou&s;and, who live very comfortably by the trade they carry on in furs and naval &s;tores, and by their fi&s;heries. Here the governor and council re&s;ides, and a con&s;iderable garri&s;on is kept. The town is al&s;o well fortified. The pre&s;ent governor is lord Wil|liam Campbell, third &s;on of his grace the duke of Argyle.</P>
<P>Annapolis &s;tands on the ea&s;t &s;ide of the Bay of Fundy. Though but a &s;mall place, it has a noble harbour, capable of containing a thou&s;and ve&s;&s;els at anchor, in the utmo&s;t &s;ecurity. Here al&s;o is a fort and garri&s;on.</P>

<P>Can&s;o is &s;ituated on an i&s;land at the ea&s;t end of the penin&s;ula, near the Strait of Fron&s;ac, which divides Nova-Scotia from Cape Breton. It may in time become a place of importance, on account of the excellent fi&s;hery in its neighbourhood, e&s;pe|cially as the French have it not in their power now, as formerly, to di&s;turb the fi&s;heries, and encroach on the territories of the province, which has a pro&s;pect of enjoying peace many years, if it is not inter|rupted by the Indians.</P>

Naturali&s;ts a&s;cribe the early approach, the length and &s;everity of the win|ters, to the large fre&s;h-water lakes lying to the north-we&s;t of New-England, which being con|&s;tantly frozen over from the beginning of Novem|ber to June or July, occa&s;ion tho&s;e piercing winds which prove &s;o fatal to mariners on this coa&s;t. Towards the &s;ea the land is generally low, and frequently mar&s;hy; but as you advance into the country, it ri&s;es into hills, and on the north-ea&s;t becomes altogether rocky and mountainous.

Ma&s;&s;achu&s;et's Bay the &s;oil is black, and rich as in any part of England; and the fir&s;t planters found the gra&s;s above a yard high, but rank, for want of mowing. The uplands are le&s;s fruitful, being for the mo&s;t part a mixture of &s;and and gravel, in|clining to clay.</P>
<P>The fruits of Old-England come to great perfection here, particularly peaches and apples. Here are al&s;o all kinds of e&s;culent plants, pul&s;e, and corn; but Indian corn or maiz, which the natives call weachin, is the mo&s;t cultivated, and was the only kind known on the fir&s;t arrival of the Europeans. This corn is of &s;everal colours, red, white, yellow, black, green, &amp;c. and the diver&s;ity frequently appears not only in the &s;ame field, but in the very &s;ame ear, though white and yellow are the mo&s;t common. Each ear, at a medium, pro|duces about two hundred and forty grains, which is an a&s;toni&s;hing increa&s;e. This corn the Indians boil till it is tender, and eat with fi&s;h, fowl, or fle&s;h, as bread. Sometimes they brui&s;e it in mortars, and then boil it; but the mo&s;t u&s;ual method is to dry the corn high, without burning it, then to beat it in mortars into fine meal, and &s;ift it, which the Indi|ans either eat dry, or mixed with water. The Engli&s;h bake it in the &s;ame manner as flour; but the be&s;t food made from it is called &s;am&s;i, be|ing &s;teeped in water for near half an hour, beat in a mortar, then &s;ifted, boiled, and eaten with milk, or butter and &s;ugar, like rice, which is not only an agreeable, but a whole&s;ome &s;trengthening diet. The Engli&s;h al&s;o brew good &s;trong been from it.</P>
<P>New-England abounds in excellent timber, oak, a&s;h, pine, fir, cedar, elm, cypre&s;s, beech, walnut, che&s;nut, hazel, &s;a&s;&s;afras, &s;amach, and other woods u&s;ed in dying or tanning leather, carpenters work, and &s;hip-building; yet &s;uch was the de&s;truction
<PB N="274" REF="2730">
made in the fore&s;ts, that a law pa&s;&s;ed to prevent the wa&s;te of woods, by inflicting penalties on tho&s;e who cut down trees of a certain kind, before they were arrived at a &s;pecified growth and age. The oaks here are &s;aid to be inferior to tho&s;e of Old-England; but the firs are of a prodigious bulk, and furni&s;h the royal navy of England with ma&s;ts and yards; and they draw from the&s;e and other trees, pitch, tar, ro&s;in, turpentine, gums, and balm: the &s;oil al&s;o producing hemp and flax, a &s;hip may be built and rigged out with the produce thereof; and &s;hip building is actually a con&s;iderable em|ployment in this country.</P>
<P>There is no where a greater abundance and va|riety of fowl than in New-England; as gee&s;e, ducks, turkies, hens, partridges, wigeons, &s;wans, herons, heathcocks, pigeons, &amp;c. nor is the fea|thered kind in greater plenty than the quadrupeds, more immediately nece&s;&s;ary to human &s;ub&s;i&s;tence and convenience. All kinds of European cattle thrive here, and multiply exceedingly: the hor&s;es of the province are hardy, mettle&s;ome, and &s;er|viceable, but &s;mall. Here are al&s;o elks, deer, hares, rabbits, &s;quirrels, beavers, otters, monkies, racoons, &s;ables, bears, wolves, foxes, ounces, and a variety of other tame and wild quadrupeds; &s;ome of which are imported into Great-Britain as foreign curio&s;ities. But the mo&s;t extraordinary of the&s;e animals is the mo&s;e, or moo&s;e deer; the black &s;pecies of which, Mr. Jo&s;&s;elin tells us, is about twelve feet high, with four horns, and broad palms, &s;ome di&s;tant near twelve feet from the tip of one horn to the other. His body is about the &s;ize of a bull; his neck re&s;embles a &s;tag's; his tail is &s;omewhat longer; and his fle&s;h extremely grateful. The light coloured moo&s;e, called wampoon by the Indians, is of a &s;maller &s;tature, and much more common than the black The rattle-&s;nake is ano|ther natural curio&s;ity of New-England, though not
<PB N="275" REF="2740">
peculiar to it. Its length is about four or five feet' and its poi&s;on mortal in a few hours, unle&s;s proper remedies are applied; but it &s;eldom attacks any human creature, without provocation.</P>
<P>The &s;eas round New England, as well as its ri|vers, abound with fi&s;h, and even whales of &s;everal kinds, viz. the whale-bone whale, the &s;permaceti whale, which yields ambergrea&s;e, the fin-back|ed whale, the &s;crag whale, and the bunch whale, of which they take great numbers, and &s;end be&s;ides &s;ome &s;hips every year to fi&s;h for whales in Greenland. The bone of the New-England whale, however, is &s;aid to be too brittle, and not &s;o &s;erviceable as that of Greenland. A terrible creature, called the whale-killer, from twenty to thirty feet long, with &s;trong teeth and jaws, per&s;ecutes the whale in the&s;e &s;eas; but afraid of his mon&s;trous &s;trength, they &s;eldom attack a full grown whale, or indeed a young one, but in companies of ten or twelve.</P>
<P>The principal rivers here are Connecticut, Thames, Patuxet, Merrimack, Pi&s;cataqua, Saco, Ca&s;co, Kennebeck, Penob&s;cot, or Pentagonet. The mo&s;t remarkable bays and harbours are tho&s;e formed by Plymouth, Rhode I&s;land, and Provi|dence Plantations; Monument Bay; We&s;t Har|bour, formed by the bending of Cape Cod; Bo&s;ton harbour; Pi&s;cataqua; and Ca&s;co bay. The chief capes are Cape Cod, Marble Head, Cape Anne, Cape Netick, Cape Porpus, Cape Elizabeth, and Cape Small Point.</P>
<P>The trade of New-England con&s;i&s;ts of various articles. At the mouth of the river Penob&s;cot there is a mackarel fi&s;hery, from which the inha|bitants &s;upply Barbadoes, and other Briti&s;h i&s;lands in America. They likewi&s;e fi&s;h for cod in winter, which they dry in the fro&s;t. Their &s;alt works are upon the improving hand; and, it is &s;aid, they will &s;oon have &s;alt enough to &s;erve them&s;elves. Rich mines of iron, of a mo&s;t excellent kind and temper,
<PB N="276" REF="2750">
have been di&s;covered in New-England, and, if im|proved, in a &s;hort time they may &s;upply Great-Britain, without having recour&s;e to the northern nations for that commodity; e&s;pecially as the par|liament, to encourage the undertaking, allows both pig and bar iron to be imported duty-free. Be&s;ides mackarel and cod, they &s;end to Surinam and Cura&s;&s;ou belonging to the Dutch, and to Bar|badoes and the other Briti&s;h i&s;lands, bi&s;cuit, meal, &s;alt, provi&s;ions, &s;ometimes cattle and hor&s;es, planks, hoops, &s;hingles, pipe-&s;taves, butter, chee&s;e, grain, oil, tallow, turpentine, bark, calf-&s;kins, tobacco, apples, cyder, and onions; and of the&s;e merchan|dizes Barbadoes takes annually to the value of an hundred thou&s;and pounds &s;terling. From Barba|does, and tho&s;e other i&s;lands, they bring in return &s;ugar, cotton, ginger, and various other commo|dities. From Europe they import wine, &s;ilks, woollen cloth, toys, hardware, linen, ribbands, &s;tuffs, laces, paper, hou&s;hold furniture, hu&s;bandry tools of all kinds, cord ge, hats, &s;tockings, &s;hoes, and In|dia goods, to the value of above four hundred thou|&s;and pounds &s;terling. In &s;hort, there is no Briti&s;h manufacture that &s;erves the purpo&s;e of luxury or ornament, which the people of New-England do not import. They al&s;o &s;end &s;hips to the Bay of Honduras for logwood, which they tran&s;port to Europe; as they do &s;ugar from the We&s;t-Indies, and fi&s;h from Newfoundland. Their money is chiefly paper-currency, or what they call province|buls, which is attended with many inconveniencies. The two la&s;t wars with France and Spain intro|duced abundance of hard money.</P>
<P>Their inland trade, be&s;ides ma&s;ts, yards, and provi&s;ions of all kinds, con&s;i&s;ts chiefly of furs, and the &s;kins of beavers and martens. The furs and &s;kins are brought in by the Indians, e&s;pecially tho&s;e on the rivers Penob&s;cot and St. John; the former
<PB N="277" REF="2760">
bringing bear and elk &s;kins, and the latter beaver and otter &s;kins. Both al&s;o &s;end in marten &s;kins; tho&s;e of the former, one year with another, three thou&s;and, and tho&s;e of the latter double that number. Before the year 1743, their &s;hipping is &s;aid to have con|&s;i&s;ted of a thou&s;and &s;ail, be&s;ides fi&s;hing &s;macks. Ship-building, as we noted above, is likewi&s;e very advantageous to this colony, and continually in|crea&s;es with their trade.</P>
<P>Their manufactures are chiefly coar&s;e linen, and woollen cloth for their own u&s;e, hats, paper, &s;ugar|baking, and di&s;tilling. The di&s;putes that have, for &s;ome time, unhappily &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between Great-Bri|tain and her colonies, have put them upon attempt|ing to &s;upply them&s;elves with other manufactures, with a view to compel the mother country to yield to their demands: but they ought to be very cau|tious how they provoke the government and par|liament of Great-Britain, as it would be ea&s;y for the&s;e, without landing a &s;ingle man upon the con|tinent, to bring them into the mo&s;t deplorable &s;itu|ation, by ruining their trade; though, it mu&s;t be owned, this could not be done without at the &s;ame time hurting the mother country.</P>
<P>With regard to religion, before the year 1740, the province of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;et's Bay contained above one hundred Engli&s;h congregations, be&s;ides thirty a&s;&s;emblies of Indian Chri&s;tians; but of all the&s;e congregations, not above three or four followed the forms of the church of England. Every par|ticular &s;ociety among them is independent of all other eccle&s;ia&s;tical juri&s;diction; nor does there lie any appeal from their puni&s;hments or cen&s;ures. Their church government admits of &s;ynods; but tho&s;e &s;ynods have no power to enforce their own acts, or to e&s;tabli&s;h any thing coercive. All they can do is to deliberate on general matters, which are to be laid before the &s;everal churches, who have
<PB N="278" REF="2770">
power to reject or approve of them, as they &s;ee proper. The magi&s;trates have power to call a &s;y|nod upon any particular exigency, and even to give their opinion in it. The mini&s;ters of Bo&s;ton de|pend entirely on the genero&s;ity of their hearers for &s;upport; a voluntary contribution being made for them, by the congregation, every time di|vine &s;ervice is celebrated. Every town of fifteen families is obliged to maintain a &s;chool for reading and writing, and, of an hundred families, a gram|mar &s;chool, for the in&s;truction of youth; be&s;ides which, there are four colleges. They have no holidays, but that of the annual election of the magi&s;trates of Bo&s;ton, and the commencement at Cambridge. Though the independents who fir&s;t tran&s;ported them&s;elves hither, rather than conform to the church of England, complained of the go|vernment here for not allowing a toleration, yet they permitted no other &s;ect or denomination of Chri&s;tians but them&s;elves, to have any &s;hare of the governments they erected there; and were &s;o far from allowing a toleration to tho&s;e that differed from them, that they hanged &s;everal quakers. It is not long &s;ince they &s;uffered any member of the church of England to have a &s;hare in the ma|gi&s;tracy, or to be elected a member of the com|mons, or hou&s;e of repre&s;entatives; and there are not more than two or three admitted at this day into their councils. Tho&s;e of the church of Eng|land do not amount to a fourth part of the inhabi|tants of this colony.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the government of New-Eng|land, it is ob&s;erved by Mr. Dummer, that by the new charter granted to the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ets by king William III. the appointment of a governor, lieu+tenant governor, &s;ecretary, and all the officers of the admiralty, is ve&s;ted in the crown; that the power of the militia is wholly in the hands of the
<PB N="279" REF="2780">
governor, as captain-general; that all judges, ju&s;tices, and &s;heriffs, to whom the execution of the law is intru&s;ted, are nominated by the governor, with the advice of the council; and that the go|vernor has a negative on the choice of coun&s;ellors, peremptory and unlimited; and that he is not obliged to give a rea&s;on for what he does in this particular, or re&s;trained to any number; that au|thentic copies of the &s;everal acts pa&s;&s;ed by this co|lony, as well as others, ought to be tran&s;mitted to the court of England for the royal approbation; but if the laws of this colony are not repealed within three years after they are pre&s;ented, they are not repealable by the crown after that time; and that no laws, ordinances, elections of ma|gi&s;trates, or acts of government what&s;oever, are valid, without the governor's con&s;ent in writing.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding this, the people have &s;till the greate&s;t &s;hare of the power in this colony; for they not only chu&s;e the a&s;&s;embly, but this a&s;&s;embly, with the governor's concurrence, chu&s;e the coun|cil, equivalent to our hou&s;e of lords: but whe|ther the governor &s;till depends on the a&s;&s;embly, as he did not many years ago, for his annual &s;upport, we cannot &s;ay; it is probable he does not, other|wi&s;e Sir Francis Barnard, the late governor, would have been obliged to &s;tudy popularity more than he did.</P>
<P>There were originally three &s;orts of governments e&s;tabli&s;hed by the Engli&s;h on the continent of America, viz. royal governments, charter govern|ments, and proprietary governments.</P>
<P>A royal government is properly &s;o called, be|cau&s;e the colony is immediately dependent on the crown, and the king remains &s;overeign of the co|lony: he appoints the governor, council, and officers of &s;tate, and the people only elect the re|pre&s;entatives, as in England: &s;uch are the govern|ments
<PB N="280" REF="2790">
of Virginia, New-Hamp&s;hire, New-York, New-Jer&s;ey, and both Carolinas; though the Ca|rolinas were once proprietary governments.</P>
<P>A charter government is &s;o called becau&s;e the company, incorporated by the king's charter, were in a manner ve&s;ted with &s;overeign authority, to e&s;tabli&s;h what &s;ort of government they &s;aw fit; and the&s;e charter governments have generally thought fit to transfer their authority to the popu|lace; for in the&s;e governments, or rather corpora|tions, the freemen do not only chu&s;e their repre|&s;entatives, but annually chu&s;e their governor, coun|cil, and magi&s;trates, and make laws, without the concurrence, and even without the knowledge of the king; and are under no other re&s;traint than this, that they enact no laws contrary to the laws of England; if they do, their charters are liable to be forfeited. Such are the governments of Rhode-I&s;land and Connecticut, in New-England, and &s;uch was that of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ets formerly; but from what has been &s;aid above, it appears now to be different from, or rather a mixture of, both.</P>
<P>The third kind of government is the proprietary, properly &s;o called, becau&s;e the proprietor is inve&s;t|ed with &s;overeign authority: he appoints the go|vernor, council, and magi&s;trates, and the repre|&s;entatives are &s;ummoned in his name, and by their advice he enacts laws, without the concurrence of the crown; but, by a late &s;tatute, the proprietor mu&s;t have the king's con&s;ent in the appointing a governor, when he does not re&s;ide in the planta|tion in per&s;on, and of a deputy-governor, when he does; and all the governors of the plantations are liable to be called to an account for mal-admini&s;|tration by the court of King's Bench. The only proprietary governments now in being are tho&s;e of Maryland and Pen&s;ylvania.</P>
<P><PB N="281" REF="2800">
The general a&s;&s;embly of New-England, in con|currence, impo&s;e taxes, makes grants, enacts laws, and redre&s;&s;es public grievances of every kind. It con&s;i&s;ts of the magi&s;trates, and a certain number of repre&s;entatives, who form two chambers, &s;o nearly re&s;embling our lords and commons, that the concurrence of the majority of both is nece&s;&s;ary before any bill can be pre&s;ented to the governor for his a&s;&s;ent. Every town, if it contains thirty|two burge&s;&s;es, can &s;end two repre&s;entatives to par|liament; if twenty, one; but Bo&s;ton nominates four.</P>
<P>The laws of the greate&s;t con&s;equence in this colo|ny are tho&s;e &s;pecified by Mr. Dummer. "There has been (&s;ays he) from the beginning, an office erected by law in every county, where all conveyances of land are entered at large, after the granters have ac|knowledged them before a ju&s;tice of peace; by which means no per&s;on can &s;ell his e&s;tate twice, or take up more money upon it than it is worth. Provi&s;ion has likewi&s;e been made for the &s;ecurity of life and property, in the election, of juries, who are not returned by the &s;heriff of the county, but are cho&s;en by the inhabitants of the towns; and this election is under the exacte&s;t regulation that human prudence can &s;ugge&s;t for preventing cor|ruption." The &s;ame author ob&s;erves, "That &s;heriffs in the Plantations are comparatively but little officers, and therefore not to be tru&s;ted like ours. Redre&s;s in the New-England courts of law is very quick and cheap, all proce&s;&s;es are in Engli&s;h, and no &s;pecial pleadings or demurrers are admitted; but the general i&s;&s;ue is always given, and &s;pecial matters brought in evidence, which &s;aves time and expence; and in this ca&s;e a man is not liable to lo&s;e his e&s;tate for a defect in form, nor is the merits of the cau&s;e made to depend on the niceties of clerk&s;hip. By a law of the coun|try,
<PB N="282" REF="2810">
no writ may be abated for a circum&s;tantial er|ror, &s;uch as a &s;light mi&s;nomer, or any informality; and by another law it is enacted, that every at|torney taking out a writ from the clerk's office &s;hall indor&s;e his &s;urname upon it, and be liable to pay the adver&s;e party his co&s;ts and charges, in ca&s;e of non-pro&s;ecution and di&s;continuance, or that the plaintiff be non &s;uited, or judgment pa&s;t again&s;t him: and it is provided in the &s;ame act, that if the plaintiff &s;hall &s;uffer a non&s;uit by the attorney's mi&s;laying the action, he &s;hall be obliged to draw a new writ without a fee, in ca&s;e the party &s;hould &s;ee fit to receive the &s;uit. For the quicker di&s;patch of cau&s;es, declarations are made parts of the writ, in which the ca&s;e is particularly &s;et forth. If it be a matter of accompt, the accompt is annexed to the writ, and copies of both left with the de|fendant, which being done fourteen days before the &s;itting of the court, he is obliged to plead di|rectly, and the i&s;&s;ue is then tried. Nor are the people of New-England oppre&s;&s;ed with the infi|nite delays and expence that attend proceedings in Chancery. But as in all other countries, England only excepted, <HI>jus</HI> and <HI>oequum</HI> are held the &s;ame, and never divided; &s;o it is here, a power of chancery being ve&s;ted in the judges of the courts of com|mon law as to &s;ome particular ca&s;es, and they make equitable con&s;tructions in others. The fees of officers of all &s;orts are &s;ettled by acts of a&s;&s;embly at moderate prices."</P>
<P>The laws here are very &s;evere again&s;t quakers. To bring one in, is a forfeiture of an hundred pounds; to conceal one, forty &s;hillings an hour; to go to a quaker's meeting, ten &s;hillings; to preach there, five &s;hillings. If a quaker be not an inhabitant he is &s;ubject to bani&s;hment, and if he returns, death. Vagrant quakers to be whipped, branded with the letter R on the left
<PB N="283" REF="2820">
&s;houlder, and bani&s;hed; if they return, death. No per&s;on can be arre&s;ted, if there are any means of &s;atisfaction; nor impri&s;oned, unle&s;s there be a concealment of effects. Adultery is death to both parties.</P>
<P>This, and &s;ome of the other colonies on the con|tinent, have ventured of late to di&s;pute the au|thority of the parliament of Great-Britain to lay taxes upon them; and this, in particular, hath pro|ceeded &s;o far in their oppo&s;ition, that the govern|ment hath been obliged to order &s;everal regiments and &s;hips of war to Bo&s;ton, to enforce due re&s;pect and obedience to the legi&s;lature; but it is to be hoped, that the&s;e differences will &s;oon be amicably adju&s;ted.</P>
<P>More than twenty years ago it was computed, that New-England contained about three hundred thou&s;and &s;ouls; of which about &s;ixty thou&s;and were effective men, from &s;ixteen to &s;ixty years of age: that of the&s;e, the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ets Bay in particular, contained thirty thou&s;and; the colony of Connecticut, fourteen thou&s;and; Rhode-I&s;land, and Providence Plantation, &s;even thou&s;and; New-Hamp&s;hire, five thou&s;and; and the province of Maine, four thou&s;and. Their militia forms a con&s;i|derable body of men; that of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ets only con&s;i&s;ting of &s;ix regiments of foot, and fifteen troops of hor&s;e, of an hundred men in each troop. In the year 1748, the colony of New-England rai&s;ed, armed, and tran&s;ported to Cape Breton four thou&s;and men, who took Loui&s;bourg, which proved an equivalent, at the peace of Aix-la-Chapelle, for all the &s;ucce&s;&s;es of the French upon the continent of Europe; and in the late war they contributed con&s;iderably to that exten|&s;ion of territory in North-America, that will in time make the crown of Great-Britain, if it has not already, the mo&s;t powerful of any in the world.
<PB N="284" REF="2830">
In the whole colony are twenty-&s;even fortified places, upon eleven navigable rivers; but the con|que&s;t of Canada, and the forts among the Indians, garri&s;oned by his maje&s;ty's troops, will render the&s;e le&s;s nece&s;&s;ary than formerly.</P>
<P>The Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ets colony received its name from the Indians, who inhabited the&s;e parts when the Engli&s;h fir&s;t came hither. Its boundaries are, the colonies of Connecticut and New-York on the we&s;t; the ocean on the ea&s;t and &s;outh; and Merri|mack river on the north. It is &s;ubdivided into the provinces of Plymouth, Ma&s;&s;achu&s;et Proper, and Maine.</P>
<P>The province of Plymouth, which is the mo&s;t &s;outherly, runs along the coa&s;t an hundred miles, from Cape Cod to Cape Manche&s;ter; and is near fifty broad, from Monument Bay to Sectuati. It is divided into the counties of Bri&s;tol, Plymouth, and Barn&s;taple, taking their names from the chief towns of each, of which Bri&s;tol is large and po|pulous, having a commodious harbour, and the be&s;t trade in New-England next to Bo&s;ton.</P>
<P>On the coa&s;t of this province lie &s;everal other i&s;lands, particularly Rhode-I&s;land, Elizabeth I&s;land, Martha's or Martin's Vineyard, and Nantucket, in which are &s;everal towns or villages of chri&s;tianized Indians.</P>
<P>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ets Proper is bounded by New-York on the we&s;t; by Plymouth and Connecticut on the &s;outh; New-Hamp&s;hire on the north; and by Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ets Bay on the ea&s;t, and contains the counties of Suffolk, Middle&s;ex, and E&s;&s;ex, all of them &s;ituate on Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ets Bay. The capi|tals of tho&s;e three counties are Bo&s;ton, Cambridge, and Salem.</P>
<P>Bo&s;ton is not only the chief town of the county of Middle&s;ex, but of all New-England, and even
<PB N="285" REF="2840">
of the whole Briti&s;h empire in America. It &s;tands on a penin&s;ula at the bottom of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ets Bay, about eight miles from its mouth, and is well for|tified. The approach to the harbour by &s;hipping is narrow; but within it there is room enough for five hundred &s;ail to lie at anchor, in a good depth of water. On one of the i&s;lands of the Bay &s;tands Fort William, the mo&s;t regular fortre&s;s in the Briti&s;h Plantations: no &s;hip can approach the town, without pa&s;&s;ing directly under the guns of the fort. About two leagues from the city is a light-hou&s;e, erected on a rock, which, in time of war, makes &s;ignals to the ca&s;tle, and the ca&s;tle to the town. At the bottom of the Bay, which is &s;pacious enough to contain the whole royal navy, is a pier, near two thou&s;and feet in length, with a row of merchants warehou&s;es on the north &s;ide. The city lies in the &s;hape of a half-moon round the harbour, and is &s;aid to contain near thirty thou&s;and inhabitants; being in length about two miles, and in &s;ome places near three quarters of a mile broad. Here are ten churches of all denominations, a fine town|hou&s;e, five printing-pre&s;&s;es, and &s;everal book&s;ellers &s;hops. Here al&s;o the governor re&s;ides, the ge|neral a&s;&s;embly and the chief courts of judicature are held, and here are tran&s;acted the affairs of the whole province. There is a market every Thur&s;|day, and fairs for three days together, beginning on the fir&s;t Tue&s;day in May, and the la&s;t Tue&s;day in October. Upon the whole, Bo&s;ton is the mo&s;t flouri&s;hing place of trade and commerce in Ame|rica, above &s;ix hundred &s;hips having been laden here in a year, for Europe and the Briti&s;h Planta|tions, with lumber, beef, pork, fi&s;h, &amp;c. The neck of land which joins the penin&s;ula on which the city is built to the continent, it is &s;aid, is not above forty yards wide.</P>

Cambridge &s;tands on the north branch of Charles River, &s;ix or &s;even miles north-we&s;t from Bo&s;ton. Here is a &s;ort of an univer&s;ity, con&s;i&s;ting of two colleges, called Harvard College, and Sloughton Hall, which is pretty well endowed, and has a tolerable library, with a pre&s;ident, five fellows, and two profe&s;&s;ors, one of mathematics, and another of divinity.</P>

from Long I&s;land by an arm of the &s;ea. It is &s;aid to be about one hundred miles in length, and about &s;eventy in breadth. Connecticut River, which is one of the large&s;t in New-England, runs through the heart of the province, and is navigable above forty miles for large ve&s;&s;els, and much farther for &s;mall ones. This colony abounds in metals, and naval &s;tores, e&s;pecially timber, and has many good ports. Upwards of forty years ago the inhabitants were computed at thirty thou&s;and. The colony is divided into four counties, and its chief towns are Newhaven, Hertford, and New-London.</P>
<P>Newhaven &s;tands upon the coa&s;t, and has a college for academical learning, called Yale Hall, pretty well endowed, and furni&s;hed with a good library.</P>
<P>Hertford is a hand&s;ome populous town, &s;ituated on the banks of Connecticut River.</P>
<P>New-London is a town of good trade, &s;ituated on the we&s;t &s;ide, and near the mouth of the river, called Thames.</P>
<P>The colony of Rhode-I&s;land comprehends, be|&s;ides the i&s;land, a di&s;trict on the continent, called Providence Plantation. The i&s;land, which is about fifteen or &s;ixteen miles long, and about four or five broad, is called the Paradi&s;e of New-Eng|land, for the fruitfulne&s;s of the &s;oil, and the tem|peratene&s;s of the climate. A great trade is carried on in it to the &s;ugar-colonies with butter, chee&s;e, hor&s;es, &s;heep, beef, pork, tallow, &amp;c. The chief town is Newport, &s;ituated on the &s;outh-we&s;t part of it, and having a good harbour, defended by a regular fort.</P>
<P>Providence Plantation, which lies oppo&s;ite to Rhode I&s;land, and is about twenty miles &s;quare, has two large thriving towns, near the mouth of
<PB N="288" REF="2870">
the river Patuxel; one of which is called Provi|dence, and the other Warwick.</P>
<P>The colony of Rhode-I&s;land took its ri&s;e in the following manner:</P>
<P>About the year 1639, it &s;eems the pre&s;byterians or independents at Bo&s;ton were divided into two &s;ects; one of which was for the covenant of grace, and the other for that of works. The latter of the&s;e being the mo&s;t powerful, to convince their oppo|nents of their love of good works, bani&s;hed them from Bo&s;ton; upon which, the other had the grace to go to Rhode I&s;land, and lay the founda|tion of a new &s;ettlement.</P>
<P>There was no attempt to &s;ettle New-England till the reign of king James I. who, by letters patent dated the 10th of April 1606, erected two compa|nies, empowering them to &s;end colonies to Virgi|nia, as all the north-ea&s;t coa&s;t of America was then called. One of tho&s;e companies was called the Plymouth company, who for &s;ome time traded on|ly with the natives of North-America, or New-Virginia, for furs, and fi&s;hed upon the coa&s;t. About the year 1619, &s;ome di&s;&s;enters of the inde|pendent per&s;ua&s;ion, who were unea&s;y at being re|quired to conform to the church of England, hav|ing purcha&s;ed the Plymouth patent, and obtained another from King James to &s;end colonies to North-Virginia, now New-England, embarked an hundred and fifty men on board a &s;hip, which &s;ailed from Plymouth the 6th of September 1620, and arrived at Cape Cod, in New-England, on the 9th of November following, where they built a town, by the name of New-Plymouth. The Indians were too much engaged in war among them&s;elves to give the&s;e &s;trangers any di&s;turbance; and, luck|ily for them, Ma&s;&s;a&s;oit, prince of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ets nation, entered into an alliance, offen&s;ive and de|fen&s;ive,
<PB N="289" REF="2880">
with the Engli&s;h, by who&s;e a&s;&s;i&s;tance he hoped to make a conque&s;t of the Narragan&s;et na|tion, with which he was then at war. He al&s;o con&s;ented to acknowledge the king of England for his &s;overeign, and made a ce&s;&s;ion of part of his country to the new planters: &s;everal other princes followed his example. Ships arriving every day with planters and provi&s;ions, the colony &s;oon be|came well e&s;tabli&s;hed, when differences ari&s;ing up|on account of religion, had like to have been of very bad con&s;equence. The independents, who were the mo&s;t numerous, not allowing a toleration to any other &s;ect or per&s;ua&s;ion, &s;everal of the ad|venturers removed to other parts of the country, and others returned home, whereby the colony was &s;o weakened, that if the Indians had not been en|gaged in a civil war, the Engli&s;h would infallibly have been driven out of the country. In the mean time, another &s;et of adventurers purcha&s;ed, in 1627, a grant of the Plymouth company of all that part of New-England which lies between the rivers Merimack and Charles, and, to &s;trengthen their title, procured a grant of it from king Charles in 1628. This new company fitted out &s;ix &s;hips, with three hundred planters, furni&s;hed with live cattle, and all manner of &s;tores and provi&s;ions. In 1630 they built Bo&s;ton, on the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ets Bay. The &s;ame year king Charles granted part of the county of Connecticut to the earl of Warwick, which was afterwards purcha&s;ed of that earl by Wil|liam lord vi&s;count Say and Seale, Robert lord Brook, Sir Nathaniel Rich, Charles Fiennes, John Pym, and John Hampden, e&s;quires, gentlemen at that time di&s;affected to the government, who de|&s;igned that plantation as a place of refuge, in ca&s;e they had not &s;ucceeded in their oppo&s;ition to king Charles; and they were once upon the point of tran&s;porting them&s;elves thither with the chief of
<PB N="290" REF="2890">
their party, being in doubt whether they &s;hould carry their point in the &s;enate: even Cromwell, it is &s;aid, was once on board, in order to have tran&s;ported him&s;elf to New-England; and there appears to have been a proclamation publi&s;hed in 1627, prohibiting people to tran&s;port them&s;elves without licence, whereby Cromwell, Sir Arthur Ha&s;elrig, Mr. Hampden, and &s;everal more, were prevented going; but prevailing afterwards again&s;t the crown, they &s;old their intere&s;t in tho&s;e plan|tations to others. Another &s;et of adventurers planted New-Hamp&s;hire, and others, Providence and Rhode-I&s;land; the la&s;t being chiefly compo&s;ed of quakers, driven out of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ets colony by the independents, who had long per&s;ecuted them, and even hanged &s;ome of them, for not conforming to their &s;ect Thus all the provinces of New-England were planted and well peopled within the &s;pace of twenty years, reckoning from the arrival of the fir&s;t colony at New-Plymouth, during which time they were very little interrupted by the Indians; but the Engli&s;h colony of Connecticut beginning to erect fortre&s;&s;es, and extend their &s;ettlements to the we&s;tward, without leave of the natives, the In|dians were alarmed, apprehending they &s;hould in time be di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of their country, and en&s;laved by the&s;e foreigners. The Sachem Metacomet therefore, to whom the Engli&s;h gave the name of Philip, the &s;on of Ma&s;&s;a&s;oit, who fir&s;t entered into alliance with the Engli&s;h, ob&s;erving the danger his country was in, and that the Engli&s;h now no longer acted as allies, but tyrannized over his peo|ple, and had in a manner deprived him of his au|thority, di&s;patched me&s;&s;engers privately through all the tribes of the Indians, inviting them to take up arms in defence of their country, which they did, and &s;ucceeded in &s;everal engagements at fir&s;t; but their prince Philip being killed by a mu&s;ket|&s;hot,
<PB N="291" REF="2900">
the Engli&s;h at length prevailed. Great num|bers of the Indians were ma&s;&s;acred, and others were driven out of their country, and joined the French in Canada, who promi&s;ing them protecton, and frequently a&s;&s;i&s;ting them in their inroads upon the Briti&s;h &s;ettlements, it is not to be wondered at, that they continued &s;o much attached to the French, while they had any footing in North-America.</P>
<P>We &s;hall here give &s;ome account of the Iroquois, the mo&s;t powerful tribe of Indians in all North-America, and the mo&s;t attached to the Engli&s;h. They are divided into many nations, of which five are more eminent than the re&s;t, po&s;&s;e&s;s a large extent of country at the back of the colonies of New-Eng|land, New-York, Pen&s;ylvania, and the Jer&s;eys, about the lakes Ontario, Erie, and Huron. Each of them have a large village belonging to them, which are &s;aid to contain altogether about fourteen thou|&s;and &s;ouls, that is, according to their way of reckon|ing, fifteen hundred fighting men, two thou&s;and old men, four thou&s;and married women, two thou|&s;and unmarried, and four thou&s;and children. They &s;peak much the &s;ame language, and form a kind of commonwealth; for a general a&s;&s;embly is held every year, compo&s;ed of deputies from each na|tion, where all matters that concern the whole bo|dy are decided, and their union ratified by a ban|quet, wherein they drink out of the cup, and &s;moke out of the calumet, of the Five Nations. The la&s;t of the&s;e, which is no other than a kind of pipe, the bowl of which is made of a &s;oft red marble, and the &s;tem of &s;ome kind of reed, of a good length, is looked upon by mo&s;t of the Indian na|tions in North-America as &s;o &s;acred, that when a treaty, whether of peace or alliance, &amp;c. hath been &s;olemnly ratified by the deputies of the re&s;pective nations &s;moaking out of it in their turns, the in|fringement of it is accounted an act of the mo&s;t
<PB N="292" REF="2910">
atrocious and dangerous nature, and &s;uch as can|not fail to draw down the mo&s;t dreadful puni&s;h|ments upon the authors. Each nation hath its own calumet, which is commonly longer and larger, and more or le&s;s adorned with feathers, and other trinkets, according to their dignity or precedence. It is &s;eldom or never u&s;ed, but to ra|tify leagues, treaties, and &s;uch like public acts.</P>
<P>When two nations are engaged in a war with one another, and one of them &s;ends the calumet to the other, it may indeed be rejected; but if they accept of it, they are immediately obliged to lay down their arms on both &s;ides, and come to a treaty; which, if agreed to, the pipe is lighted, and &s;moaked by the deputies; if not, it is &s;ent back, and ho&s;tilities commenced.</P>
<P>They have &s;ome Indian corn and beans, as al&s;o water-melons, pompions, &amp;c. which are very large, &s;weet, and of a fine flavour; but they are too lazy to give them&s;elves much trouble about cultivating the ground, and live chiefly by hunting and fi&s;h|ing.</P>

<HEAD>NEW-YORK and the JERSEYS.</HEAD>
<P>New-York is bounded on the &s;outh and &s;outh|we&s;t by Hud&s;on's and Delaware rivers, which di|vide it from the Ea&s;t and We&s;t Jer&s;eys, and Pen|&s;ylvania; on the ea&s;t and north-ea&s;t by New-Eng|land; and on the north-we&s;t by Canada. Its extent from north to &s;outh, that is from Sandy-Hook, in latitude 40&deg;. 30&prime;. to the &s;uppo&s;ed Canada line, in the parallel of 45&deg;. is three hundred and thirteen Engli&s;h miles; but its extent from ea&s;t to we&s;t is various, being in &s;ome places eighty-eight, in others one hundred, and in others &s;tretching as far as Lake Erie, and from thence along Lake Erie, and the communicating great run of water from Lake Erie to the Lake Ontario, O&s;wego, or Ca|taraqui,
<PB N="293" REF="2920">
and along that lake to the afore&s;aid Cana|da's &s;uppo&s;ed line. O&s;wego Fort or trading place, &s;ituated upon the Lake Ontario, Cataraqui, or O&s;|wego, in lat $3$. lies two hundred miles from Al|bany to the north-$$&s;t; and Montreal lies north-by|ea&s;t of Albany above two hundred and twenty miles.</P>
<P>The $Word$ have Delaware river on the &s;outh and we&s;t; The Bay on the &s;outh-ea&s;t; the Atlan|tic Ocean on the ea&s;t; and New-York on the north; extending in length, along the &s;ea-coa&s;t and Hud&s;on's river, from &s;outh to north, one hundred and forty miles; and about eighty where broade&s;t. The &s;outh part of New-York and the Jer&s;eys are low flat countries, and exceeding fertile; but a&s;|cending twenty or thirty miles up Hud&s;on's river to the north, the country is rocky and mountainous, and covered with wood, where it has not been cleared by the planters. The air and &s;ea&s;ons in the&s;e colonies are much the &s;ame as in New-England.</P>
<P>The chief rivers, be&s;ides tho&s;e of Hud&s;on and Delaware, are Mohawk river, Onandago, Raritan, and Maurice rivers. The exten&s;ive lakes of Cham|plain, Ontario, and Erie, lie on the frontiers of the province of New-York to the north-we&s;t. The capes are tho&s;e of Cape Mary, on the ea&s;t en|trance of Delaware river; Sandy Point, near the entrance of Raritan river; and Mountang Point, at the ea&s;t end of Long-I&s;land. That i&s;land, and another called Staten I&s;land, belong to the pro|vince of New-York. The fir&s;t, which the Dutch call Na&s;&s;au, is about one hundred and twenty miles long, from ea&s;t to we&s;t; but no more than ten, at a medium, in breadth. The ea&s;tern part of it was &s;ettled from New-England; but two thirds of it is a barren &s;andy &s;oil. Staten I&s;land is about twelve miles in length and &s;ix in breadth, and is inha|bited by Dutch and French, as well as Engli&s;h.

Tantucket or Nantucket, Martha's Vineyard, and Elizabeth i&s;lands, formerly belonged to New-York; but were by the new charter of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ets Bay, granted at the Revolution, annexed to that colony.</P>
<P>As to the produce and commodities of New-York and the Jer&s;eys, they con&s;i&s;t of hor&s;es, pipe-&s;taves; pork, beef, and fi&s;h, &s;alted and barrelled up; oil of whales and &s;ea-calves, &s;kins and furs, iron and copper; all &s;orts of grain, as wheat, rye, pea&s;e, beans, oats, barley, buck-wheat, Indian corn, In|dian pea&s;e, and beans; tobacco, pot-a&s;hes, and wax, which they export to the We&s;t-Indian i&s;lands, not excepting the French and Dutch, and to Eng|land, Old Spain, Africa, and Portugal; import|ing, in return, rum, &s;ugar, mola&s;&s;es, negroes, &s;alt, and wine; and from Great-Britain, in particular, hou&s;hold goods, cloathing of all kinds, hardware, tools, and toys. They traffic al&s;o with the log|wood-cutters in the Bay of Honduras, and with the Spani&s;h &s;ettlements, exchanging the manufactures of Europe for trea&s;ure, which they &s;end to England as merchandize. Their dried and &s;alted fi&s;h are &s;ent chiefly to Spain, Portugal, Italy, and other countries of Europe, whither they al&s;o &s;end great quantities of timber. Their trade with the Indians con&s;i&s;ts but in a few articles: they receive of the natives chiefly &s;kins and furs of their wild bea&s;ts, for which they give them cloathing, arms, ammu|nition, rum, and other &s;pirits, in return. The fa|cility of the voyage from New-York to England, and the We&s;t-Indies, has been of infinite &s;ervice; for, by the lowne&s;s of the freight, they purcha&s;e furs at a very cheap rate for &s;trouds (a woollen ma|nufacture e&s;tabli&s;hed at Stroud in England) and other woollen goods, all which are &s;ure of a ready vent with the Indians. Bri&s;tol is the chief place in England which the coloni&s;ts of New-York trade
<PB N="295" REF="2960">
with; and they generally perform two voyages in a year with &s;o much &s;afety, that the in&s;urance upon &s;hipping, in time of peace, is no more than two per cent. Near twenty years ago, it was computed that the imports of this colony from England amounted annually to about an hundred and fifty thou&s;and pounds. All kinds of black cattle are more numerous here than in any European coun|try; and they have a breed of excellent hor&s;es. The Jer&s;eys, both Ea&s;t and We&s;t, are al&s;o in a very flouri&s;hing condition. Their paper currency, which &s;everal years ago amounted to upwards of &s;ixty thou&s;and pounds, has more credit than that of ei|ther Pen&s;ylvania or New-York; for the Pen&s;ylva|nia bills are not received at New-York, nor tho&s;e of New-York at Pen&s;ylvania, but the New-Jer&s;ey bills circulate through both the&s;e provinces. Be|fore the peace of Utrecht, the inhabitants of the Jer&s;eys were computed at &s;ixteen thou&s;and; but at pre&s;ent they amount to near &s;eventy thou&s;and. They are excellent corn countries; and, it is &s;aid, produce more wheat than any of the other colo|nies, of which, and other grain, they di&s;po&s;e of con|&s;iderable quantities to New-York and Pen&s;ylvania. By employing negroes, as their neighbours do, in cultivating the lands, they have of late more than doubled their value; and they now work a copper mine, and manufacture iron ore into pigs and bars. They likewi&s;e rai&s;e &s;ome flax and hemp.</P>
<P>New York and the Jer&s;eys, as we ob&s;erved al|ready, are royal governments. That of New York is admini&s;tered by a governor, who has his commi&s;&s;ion under the broad &s;eal of England. The legi&s;lative power and authority is lodged in the governor and the council, who are twelve in num|ber, appointed by the king, but are filled up by the governor, and twenty-&s;even repre&s;entatives elect|ed by the people. In other re&s;pects, the govern|ment
<PB N="296" REF="2970">
is as conformable to the laws of England, as that of a colony can be. The admini&s;tration of the government is in the governor and council, of whom five is a quorum; and upon the death or ab&s;ence of the governor, the fir&s;t in nomination of the council is to pre&s;ide. The people chu&s;e their repre&s;entatives, the numbers of whom are fixed by the crown, and the&s;e repre&s;entatives have much the &s;ame privileges as the members of the Briti&s;h parliament.</P>
<P>In the civil government of New Jer&s;ey we find there are three negatives. 1&s;t, That of the go|vernor, who is likewi&s;e vice-admiral and chan|cellor of the province. 2d, That of the council, which, with the governor, forms a court of error and chancery. 3d, Of the hou&s;e of repre&s;enta|tives, twenty of whom &s;erve for counties, and the remaining four for the two towns of Perth-Amboy and Burlington. This hou&s;e, though no court of judicature, has the privilege of enquiring into the mal-admini&s;tration of the courts of ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>Sir William Franklin, knt. is governor of Jer|&s;ey; and the earl of Dunmore, a Scotch peer, hath been lately appointed governor of New-York.</P>
<P>New-York, including Long-I&s;land and Staten-I&s;land, is divided into ten counties, namely, Rich|mond, Suffolk, Queen's-County, New-York-Coun|ty, Che&s;ter, King's-County, Orange, Duche&s;s, Ul&s;ter, and Albany; which la&s;t five counties are &s;aid to be all inhabited by Dutch, or &s;uch as are of Dutch extraction.</P>
<P>The principal towns in the&s;e are, New-York, King&s;ton, and Albany, on the continent; and Jamaica, Bedford, Southampton, Richmond, and Jer&s;ey, in Long-I&s;land, which contains the coun|ties of Richmond, Suffolk, and Queen's-County.</P>

of Hud&s;on's or the Iroquois River. It is not very large, but few cities in Europe can vie with it in regularity and neatne&s;s. The trade of the inhabi|tants is carried on by water carriage, and &s;hips of five hundred tons may come up to the wharfs of the city, and be always afloat. Hud&s;on's river, where it runs by New-York, is above three miles broad, and proves a noble conveyance for the goods of the counties of Albany, Ul&s;ter, Dutche&s;s, Orange, and King's, to that city. It contains &s;ix markets, &s;aid to be better &s;upplied with all kinds of provi&s;ions, than any in Europe. The town and harbour are defended by forts and batteries. Twelve years ago the hor&s;es kept here were com|puted at five thou&s;and. The principal edifices are the Town-hou&s;e, the Council-hou&s;e, where they hold their general a&s;&s;emblies and courts of ju&s;tice, the Engli&s;h church, the Meeting-hou&s;es of all &s;orts, the Free-&s;chool, and public Library. Here is al&s;o a Printing-office. The town is governed by a mayor and alderman, and &s;uch other officers as our corporations.</P>
<P>King&s;ton is a pretty, populous, well-built town, ninety miles up the river, where the Ae&s;opus from New Jer&s;ey falls into it.</P>
<P>Albany is one hundred and forty three miles up the river, and but five below the place where it is parted into two branches. It con&s;i&s;ts of between three and four hundred families, who are mo&s;tly of Dutch extraction, and has a &s;trong fort and gar|ri&s;on for its defence, as being &s;ituated on the fron|tier of the province.

<P>Shrew&s;bury is a con&s;iderable town, and the mo&s;t &s;outhern of the province. About thirty thou&s;and out-plantation acres are annexed to it.</P>
<P>Newark &s;tands in E&s;&s;ex county, and has about fifty thou&s;and acres annexed to it; but a part of them remains &s;till to be cultivated.</P>
<P>Middleton lies twenty-&s;ix miles &s;outh of Pi&s;ca|taqua. Between it and Shrew&s;bury is an iron|work.</P>
<P>A college was e&s;tabli&s;hed at Brun&s;wick October 22, 1746, by governor Belcher. The tru&s;tees of this college are generally Pre&s;byterians, and it is governed by a pre&s;ident.</P>
<P>As to We&s;t-Jer&s;ey it has never yet, as far as we know, been divided into counties. Burlington, which lies in an i&s;land in the middle of Delaware river, oppo&s;ite to Philadelphia, is the capital of the province, the co$rts and a&s;&s;embles of the pro|vince being held there. The town being com|modiou&s;ly &s;ituated for trade, is well built, and has a town-hou&s;e, with two bridges over the river.</P>
<P>We&s;t-Jer&s;ey has an ea&s;y communication by the river Ae&s;opus with New-York, and with Mary|land by another river, which comes within four miles of Che&s;apeak-Bay.</P>
<P>The Iroquois, which inhabit the north-we&s;t part of the province of New-York, are the brave&s;t
<PB N="299" REF="3000">
and mo&s;t formidable people of North-America; though the French, who&s;e con&s;tant enemies they were, have repre&s;ented them as the mo&s;t barba|rous &s;avages. Under the greate&s;t di&s;advantages, the want of education, and even letters, they di&s;|played a noble genius. The Romans never di&s;co|vered a greater love for their country, or a greater contempt of death in the cau&s;e of liberty, than the&s;e people do; and they are exceeding benevolent and ho&s;pitable. Every nation of the Iroquois is a di&s;tinct republic, governed by their &s;achems, or civil magi&s;trates, in time of peace; and by their warriors, or captains, in their wars: but their chiefs never re&s;olve on, nor execute any thing of importance, without con&s;ulting the heads of their tribes. They acknowledge a &s;upreme Being, whom they &s;tile the Pre&s;erver of the univer&s;e; and they believe a future &s;tate of rewards and puni&s;hments: but have very ob&s;cure indi&s;tinct notions of it, and &s;eem to think the rewards of the good will con&s;i&s;t in the enjoyment of tho&s;e plea&s;ures they were mo&s;t fond of in this life. They imagine dreaming to be nothing but a &s;ally of the &s;oul out of the body, and taking a trip into that happy land; and if the dream be unplea&s;ant, they at|tribute it to &s;ome ob&s;truction, enemy, or accident it hath met with in the way. They are very &s;trict in ob&s;erving the oaths which they &s;wear to each other, e&s;pecially tho&s;e which their warriors make of &s;tanding by one another to the la&s;t, and which they keep to &s;uch a degree, as to hazard their lives to re&s;cue the bare carca&s;e of their fallen brethren. They commonly make a kind of fea&s;t over the grave, and put into it wheat, tobacco, and every thing they think the decea&s;ed may want in the o|ther world. The women are commonly &s;o pro|lific, that it is a wonder to &s;ee one from &s;ixteen to fifty, who is not either pregnant or &s;uckling; yet
<PB N="300" REF="3010">
they do mo&s;t of the drudgery, as grinding the wheat, fetching of wood, water, and the like. The children are often &s;o &s;tubborn, that if they are found fault with, the girls will di&s;patch them&s;elves with &s;ome poi&s;onous weed, and the boys with a gun. The bu&s;ine&s;s of the men is hunting, going to war, building their huts, felling of timber, till|ing the ground, and the like. They commonly &s;ow a field with beans one year, and the next with Indian wheat.</P>
<P>The boys employ their time mo&s;tly in fowling, catching of &s;ables, and other &s;uch creatures, with gins; and the girls in going into the fields and woods, to gather che&s;nuts and other fruits. They never fight pitched battles; but their manner of carrying on war is by ambu&s;cade and &s;urprize, by accidental &s;kirmi&s;hes, and &s;udden irruptions into hou&s;es and villages, to carry off, plunder and de&s;troy all they can. They are very fond of bath|ing; and whil&s;t the weather permits, men, women, and children will go often in a day to that diver|&s;ion. They generally put the pri&s;oners they make in war to the mo&s;t excruciating and lingering deaths. Many of the&s;e and other Indians have been brought to the profe&s;&s;ion of Chri&s;tianity, and baptized, e&s;pe|cially in the neighbourhood of our &s;ettlements, &s;e|veral catechi&s;ts being always maintained for that purpo&s;e by the colonies, and the &s;ociety for pro|pagating Chri&s;tian knowledge. Some of them at|tain a tolerable knowledge of Chri&s;tianity; and we have lately &s;een in London an Indian, who preached in &s;everal di&s;&s;enting meeting-hou&s;es in and about town, and collected con&s;iderable &s;ums for conti|nuing and extending the laudable de&s;ign of con|verting the&s;e poor &s;avages.</P>
<P>While the French were ma&s;ters of Canada, the Je&s;uits, from political views, were very zealous and active in propagating their &s;uper&s;tition among the
<PB N="301" REF="3020">
Indians, and met with too great &s;ucce&s;s: even at pre&s;ent, the&s;e Popi&s;h Indians are not well affected to the Engli&s;h; but, it is to be hoped, the French in Canada will not now be &s;uffered to attempt any thing of that kind, and that our people will not be &s;o negligent in this re&s;pect as formerly, as the con|verting of the Indians is the &s;ure&s;t way of attaching them to our intere&s;t.</P>
<P>The church of England is e&s;tabli&s;hed here, and in all the royal governments in Briti&s;h America; but all modes of Chri&s;tianity, not detrimental to &s;ociety, are tolerated, the Roman Catholic ex|cepted.</P>

<HEAD>PENSYLVANIA.</HEAD>
<P>This colony, which had its name from the fa|mous quaker William Penn, &s;on of Sir William, commander of the Engli&s;h fleet in Oliver Crom|well's time, and in the beginning of Charles the Second's reign, who obtained a grant of it in the year 1679, is bounded on the ea&s;t by Delaware bay and river, and the Atlantic ocean; on the north by the country of the Iroquois, or five nations; and on the &s;outh and we&s;t by Maryland. Its extent, from north to &s;outh, is about two hundred miles; but its breadth varies greatly, from fifteen, and even le&s;s, to near two hundred.</P>
<P>The air in Pen&s;ylvania is &s;weet and clear. The fall, or autumn, begins about the 20th of October, and la&s;ts till the beginning of December, when the winter &s;ets in, which continues till March, and is &s;ometimes extremely cold and &s;evere; but the air is then generally dry and healthy. The river De|laware, though very broad, is often frozen over. From March to June, that is, in the &s;pring, the weather is more incon&s;tant than in the other &s;ea&s;ons. In the months of July, Augu&s;t, and September,
<PB N="302" REF="3030">
the heats would be almo&s;t intolerable, if they were not mitigated by frequent cool breezes. The wind, during the &s;ummer, is generally &s;outh-we&s;t; but in the winter, blows for the mo&s;t part from the north-we&s;t, over the &s;nowy frozen mountains and lakes of Canada, which occa&s;ions the exce&s;&s;ive cold during that &s;ea&s;on.</P>
<P>As to the face of this country, towards the coa&s;t, like the adjacent colonies, it is flat, but ri&s;es gradu|ally to the Apalachian mountains on the we&s;t.</P>
<P>The chief rivers are three, Delaware, Sa&s;qua|hanna, and Skoolkil. The Delaware, ri&s;ing in the country of the Iroquois, takes its cour&s;e &s;outhward, and after dividing this province from that of New Jer&s;ey, falls into the Atlantic ocean between the promontories or capes May and Henlopen, form|ing at its mouth a large bay, called, from the river, Delaware Bay. This river is navigable above two hundred miles. The Sa&s;quahanna ri&s;es al&s;o in the country of the Iroquois, and, running &s;outh thro' the middle of the province, falls into the bay of Che&s;apeake, being navigable a great way for large &s;hips. The Skoolkil has its &s;ource in the &s;ame country as the other two, and al&s;o runs &s;outh, al|mo&s;t parallel to them; till at length turning to the ea&s;tward, it falls into the Delaware at the city of Philadelphia. It is navigable for boats above one hundred miles. The&s;e rivers, with the numerous creeks and harbours in Delaware Bay, capable of containing the large&s;t fleets, are extremely favour|able to the trade of this province.</P>
<P>As to the &s;oil, produce, and traffic of Pen&s;ylva|nia, we refer the reader to what we have &s;aid on the&s;e heads under New-York and the Jer&s;eys, which is equally applicable to this province; and, if there is any difference, it is on the &s;ide of this province. They have &s;ome rice here, but no great quantities; and &s;ome tobacco, but it is not equal
<PB N="303" REF="3040">
to that of Virginia. From the premiums offered by the &s;ociety of arts in London it appears, that the &s;oil and climate of this province are looked upon as proper for the cultivation of &s;ome &s;pecies of vines. The trade carried on from hence and the other colonies to the French and Dutch i&s;lands and Surinam, is not at all to the advantage of Old England, and very de&s;tructive to the &s;ugar colo|nies; for they take mela&s;&s;es, rum, and other &s;pi|rits, with a great many European goods, from the&s;e foreigners; carrying them hor&s;es, provi&s;ions, and lumber in return, without which the French could not carry on their &s;ugar manufacture to that ad|vantage they do.</P>
<P>New-York, the Jer&s;eys, and Pen&s;ylvania, were di&s;covered, with the re&s;t of the continent of North America, in the reign of Henry the Seventh, by Seba&s;tian Cabot, for the crown of England; but Sir Walter Raleigh was the fir&s;t adventurer that attempted to plant colonies on the&s;e &s;hores, in the reign of queen Elizabeth, and, in honour of that prince&s;s, gave all the ea&s;tern coa&s;t of North Ame|rica the name of Virginia. Mr. Hud&s;on, an Eng|li&s;hman, &s;ailing to that part of the coa&s;t which lies between Virginia and New-England, in the begin|ning of the reign of James the Fir&s;t, and being about to make a &s;ettlement at the mouth of Hud|&s;on's river, the Dutch gave him a &s;um of money to di&s;po&s;e of his intere&s;t in this country to them: in the year 1608 they began to plant it, and, by virtue of this purcha&s;e, laid claim to all tho&s;e countries which are now denominated New-York, New-Jer&s;ey, and Pen&s;ylvania; but there remaining &s;ome part of this coa&s;t which was not planted by the Hollanders, the Swedes &s;ent a fleet of &s;hips thither, and took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it for that crown; but the Dutch having a &s;uperior force in the neighbourhood, compelled the Swedes to &s;ubmit to
<PB N="504" REF="3050">
their dominion, allowing them, however, to enjoy the plantations they had &s;ettled. The Engli&s;h not admitting, that either the Dutch or Swedes had any right to countries fir&s;t di&s;covered and planted by a &s;ubject of England, and part of them at that time po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the &s;ubjects of Great Britain, under charter from queen Elizabeth and king James the Fir&s;t, king Charles the Second, during the fir&s;t Dutch war, in 1664, granted the countries of New York, the Jer&s;eys, and Pen&s;ylvania, of which the Dutch had u&s;urped the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, to his brother James, duke of York; and Sir Robert Carr be|ing &s;ent over with a &s;quadron of men of war, and land forces, and &s;ummoning the Dutch governor of the city of New-Am&s;terdam, now New-York, to &s;urrender, he thought fit to obey the &s;ummons, and yield that capital to the Engli&s;h: the re&s;t of the places in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Dutch and Swedes followed his example, and the&s;e countries were con|firmed to the Engli&s;h by the Dutch at the next treaty of peace between the two nations. The duke of York afterwards parcelled them out to under proprietors; &s;elling, in particular, to Wil|liam Penn the elder, in 1683, the town of New|ca&s;tle, alias Delaware, and a di&s;trict of twelve miles round the &s;ame; to whom, his heirs and a&s;&s;igns, by another deed of the &s;ame date, he made over all that tract of land from twelve miles &s;outh of Newca&s;tle to the Whore-hills, otherwi&s;e called Cape Henlopen, now divided into the two counties of Kent and Su&s;&s;ex, which, with Newca&s;tle di&s;trict, are commonly known by the name of the Three Lower Counties upon Delaware River. All the re&s;t of the under-proprietors, &s;ome time after, &s;urrendered their charters to the crown, whereby New-York and the Jer&s;eys became royal govern|ments; but Penn retained that part of the country which had been &s;old him by the duke of York,
<PB N="305" REF="3060">
together with what had been granted to him be|fore in 1680-1, which now con&s;titutes the pro|vince of Pen&s;ylvania. As &s;oon as Penn had got his patent, he began to plant the country. Tho&s;e who went over from England were generally di&s;|&s;enters and quakers, who&s;e religion is e&s;tabli&s;hed by law here, but with a toleration of all other pro|te&s;tant &s;ects. The Dutch and Swedes, who were &s;ettled here before Mr. Penn became proprietor, chu&s;ing &s;till to re&s;ide in this country, as they did in New-York and the Jer&s;eys, obtained the &s;ame privileges as the re&s;t of his maje&s;ty's &s;ubjects; and their de&s;cendants are now, in a manner, the &s;ame people with the Engli&s;h, &s;peaking their language, and being governed by their laws and cu&s;toms. Mr. Penn however, not &s;atisfied with the title grant|ed him by king Charles II. and his brother, bought the lands al&s;o of the Indians for a va|luable con&s;ideration, or what they e&s;teemed &s;uch, (though twenty miles were purcha&s;ed, at fir&s;t, for le&s;s than an acre about Philadelphia would co&s;t now) paying them in cloth, tools, and uten&s;ils, to their entire &s;atisfaction; for they had not hands to cultivate the hundredth part of their lands, and if they could have rai&s;ed a product, there was nobody to buy: the purcha&s;e, therefore, was all clear gain to them; and, by the coming of the Engli&s;h, their peltry trade became &s;o profitable, that they &s;oon found their condition much altered for the better, and are now as well cloathed and fed as the European pea&s;antry in many places.</P>
<P>Pen&s;ylvania, at pre&s;ent, is one of the mo&s;t flouri&s;h|ing colonies in North-America, having never had any quarrel with the natives. Whenever they de&s;ire to extend their &s;ettlements, they purcha&s;e new lands of the &s;achems, never taking any by force; but the Indians now &s;et a very high price upon their lands, in compari&s;on of what they did at fir&s;t, and
<PB N="306" REF="3070">
will hardly part with them at any rate. In an e&s;|timate of the proprietary e&s;tate of the province, publi&s;hed above a dozen years ago, we find, that the proprietaries, who alone can purcha&s;e lands here from the natives, had bought &s;even millions of acres for no more than &s;even hundred and fifty pounds &s;terling, which the proprietaries afterwards &s;old at the rate of fifteen pound for every hundred acres. The Indian council at Onandago, however, di&s;approved of their deputies parting with &s;o much land; and, in the year 1755, obliged the proprie|taries to re-convey great part of the &s;ame to the Indians.</P>
<P>A di&s;pute &s;ub&s;i&s;ted a long time between the proprietaries of this province and Lord Baltimore, proprietary of Maryland, about the right to certain lands, which was at la&s;t amicably adju&s;ted, though greatly in favour of the Penns. There were al&s;o, &s;ome years &s;ince, violent di&s;putes between the pro|prietaries and the a&s;&s;embly, the former alledging, that their private e&s;tate ought to be exempted from all taxes; but whether the matter is yet &s;ettled, or not, we cannot pretend to &s;ay.</P>
<P>About the year 1704, there happened &s;ome al|teration in the con&s;titution of the province. It has now a governor, council, and a&s;&s;embly, each with much the &s;ame power and privileges as in the neighbouring colony of New-York. The lieutenant-governor and council are appointed by the proprietors, Thomas and Richard Penn, with his maje&s;ty's approbation; but if the laws enacted here are not repealed within &s;ix months after they have been pre&s;ented to the king for his approba|tion or di&s;allowance, they are not repealable by the crown after that time.</P>
<P>Pen&s;ylvania is divided into &s;even counties, four of which are called the upper, and three the lower. Of the upper, viz. Buckingham, Philadelphia,
<PB N="307" REF="3080">
Che&s;ter, and Lanca&s;ter, the three fir&s;t are the lands included in king Charles the Second's grant, and de&s;igned Pen&s;ylvania; the lower, viz. tho&s;e of Newca&s;tle, Kent, and Su&s;&s;ex, were called No|va-Belgia, before the duke of York &s;old them, as we ob&s;erved above, to Mr. Penn. The upper counties end at Marcus Hook, four miles below Che&s;ter town, where the lower begin, and run a|long the coa&s;t near one hundred miles. Each of the&s;e counties has a &s;heriff, with a quarterly and monthly &s;e&s;&s;ion, and a&s;&s;izes twice a-year. Though &s;ome parts of the colony are not yet compleatly planted and inhabited, yet it is &s;aid to have con|tained, many years ago, upwards of one hundred thou&s;and &s;ouls.</P>
<P>Philadelphia, the capital of the colony, &s;ituated in 40&deg; 30&prime;. north latitude, is one of the mo&s;t beau|tiful and regular cities in the world, being an ob|long of two miles, extending from the river De|laware to the Schuylkill, with the ea&s;t end fronting the river Delaware, the we&s;t the river Schuylkill, and each front a mile in length. The river Dela|ware, as we ob&s;erved already, is navigable from the &s;ea for large ve&s;&s;els above two hundred miles, and that of Schuylkill as far as Philadelphia. Everyman in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of one thou&s;and acres has his hou&s;e ei|ther in one of the fronts, facing the rivers, or in the high &s;treet, running from the middle of one front to the middle of the other. Every owner of five thou&s;and acres, be&s;ides the above-mentioned privilege, is entitled to have an acre of ground in the front of his hou&s;e, and all others may have half an acre, for gardens and court yards. Every quar|ter of the city forms a &s;quare of eight acres, and, almo&s;t in the centre of it, is a &s;quare of ten acres, &s;urrounded by the town-hou&s;e, and other public buildings. The high &s;treet is one hundred feet wide, and runs the whole length of the town: pa|rallel
<PB N="308" REF="3090">
to it run eight other &s;treets, which are cro&s;&s;ed by twenty more at right angles, all of them thirty feet wide, and communicating with canals from the two rivers, which add not only to the beauty, but the whole&s;omene&s;s of the city. Ships of four or five hundred tons may come up to the key, which is two hundred feet &s;quare, and furni&s;hed with all the conveniences for &s;hip-building, as well as for loading and unloading goods. Though the whole of this magnificent plan hath not yet been carried into execution, a con&s;iderable progre&s;s hath been made towards it. The town-hou&s;e is &s;o &s;tately, &s;pacious, and regular, that it would make a figure in any capital of Europe. The other public build|ings are, the court-hou&s;e, two quakers meeting-hou&s;es, one church of England, one bapti&s;t meet|ing, one Dutch Lutheran church, one Dutch Cal|vini&s;t church, one Moravian church, one ma&s;s|hou&s;e, the quakers &s;chool-hou&s;e, the city alms|hou&s;e, the quakers almshou&s;e, the ho&s;pital, pri&s;on, and work-hou&s;e.</P>
<P>The noble&s;t in&s;titution, however, in the pro|vince of Pen&s;ylvania, is the academy e&s;tabli&s;hed in this city, which, by the public encouragement it has already, and may hereafter receive, bids fair, in time, to rival the brighte&s;t &s;eminaries of learning in the mother-country, e&s;pecially in a reign &s;o be|neficent as the pre&s;ent is to literature. Dr. Smith, who is at the head of this academy, rai&s;ed a very con&s;iderable &s;um for it lately, both in England and Scotland, having obtained a brief for that purpo&s;e in regard to England, and recommendation of a collection all over Scotland, by the general a&s;&s;em|bly of the church thereof.</P>
<P>Among the &s;everal &s;ects in Philadelphia, that of the Moravians is none of the lea&s;t con&s;iderable. The wildne&s;s and extravagance of this &s;ect are well known all over Europe; but though they have a
<PB N="309" REF="3100">
chapel here, with a &s;mall organ, their principal &s;et|tlement is about fifty or &s;ixty miles from hence. The &s;imilarity of practice between them and the quakers, in &s;ome points, makes them fond of re|&s;iding in Pen&s;ylvania: like the quakers, they de|cline carrying arms in their own per&s;ons, yet con|tribute chearfully to the military e&s;tabli&s;hment for the defence of their &s;ettlements and country. Their zeal for the conver&s;ion of the Indians is incredible, exceeding, if po&s;&s;ible, that for which the Je&s;uits were formerly &s;o noted; and they have per|&s;uaded not a few of the&s;e &s;avages to come and live with them, and conform to them. About the year 1748, they &s;ent to Greenland or Davis's Straits, at their own expence, a &s;hip, with a wooden church, ready framed, for the u&s;e of the inhabitants of that country, which produces no timber; and when the &s;hip returned to Philadelphia, it brought two men and a young woman, natives of Green|land, who had been converted there by the Mora|vian mi&s;&s;ionaries. The &s;ame Moravians had then al&s;o a mi&s;&s;ion at Berbice and Surinam, from whence two converts likewi&s;e came to Pen&s;ylvania. The Pen&s;ylvanian Moravians have almo&s;t the &s;ame in|dulgence &s;hewn them by the legi&s;lature of Great-Britain, excepting in criminal ca&s;es, as the quakers have; and their ab&s;temious manner of living ena|bles them to carry on the handicrafts they profe&s;s at a cheap rate; nor are they without &s;ome men of learning and academical education among them. Their chief &s;ettlement is called Bethlehem.</P>
<P>In the county to which Philadelphia gives name are &s;everal other towns, of which the mo&s;t con&s;ide|rable are, German Town, &s;o called becau&s;e mo&s;t of the inhabitants are of that nation, or de&s;cended from &s;uch as were, Frankfort, Abington, Dublin, Radnor, Amersland, &amp;c.</P>
<P><PB N="310" REF="3110">
Of the other towns in the province the mo&s;t con&s;iderable are, Bri&s;tol, Falls Town, and Penn&s;|bury, in the county of Buckingham; Che&s;ter Town, Chiche&s;ter, and Marcus Hook, in the coun|ty of Che&s;ter; Newca&s;tle Town, Haverford-we&s;t, Merioneth, and St. George, in the county of New|ca&s;tle; Dover, Cranebrook, Marden, Me&s;pelli|ven Plantations, in the county of Kent; Lewis, in the county of Su&s;&s;ex; Lanca&s;ter, in the coun|ty to which it gives name: and fourteen miles from Lanca&s;ter, on the frontier part of the county, is a &s;mall town, called Ephrata, lying between two &s;mall hills, in the mo&s;t delightful &s;ituation that can well be imagined, as if nature had created it for the indulgence of contemplation. This town is inhabited by a &s;ect called Dumplers, or Dunk|ards, and one, perhaps, of the mo&s;t harmle&s;s and extraordinary that has appeared &s;ince the in&s;titu|tion of Chri&s;tianity. A German hermit, who &s;et|tled on the &s;pot where Ephrata is now built, was the founder of this extraordinary &s;ect. The fame of his &s;olitude in&s;pired &s;ome of his countrymen with curio&s;ity, and the &s;implicity of his life, with the piety of his conver&s;ation, induced them to join, and imitate him. A people who leave their na|tive country to enjoy liberty of con&s;cience, can bear all &s;ub&s;equent mortifications. The Germans of both &s;exes, who joined the hermit, &s;oon accu&s;|tomed them&s;elves to his way of thinking, and con|&s;equently to his manner of living; indu&s;try be|came part of their duty, and divided their time with devotion. Their gains are thrown into one common &s;tock, which &s;upplies all their exigencies, private as well as public: their females are cloi&s;|tered up by them&s;elves in a &s;eparate part of the town, the &s;ituation of which is delightful, and &s;creens them from the north wind. It is triangu|lar, and fenced round with thick rows of apple,
<PB N="311" REF="3120">
beech, and cherry trees, be&s;ides having an orchard in the middle. The hou&s;es, which are of wood, are mo&s;tly three &s;tories high; and every per&s;on has a &s;eparate apartment, that he may not be di&s;|turbed in his devotions. The women never &s;ee the men but at public wor&s;hip, or when it is ne|ce&s;&s;ary to con&s;ult upon matters of public oecono|my; and the number of both may be about three hundred. Their garb is the mo&s;t &s;imple that can be well imagined, being a long white woollen gown in winter, and linen in the &s;ummer, with a cape, which &s;erves them for a hat, like that of a capu|chin behind, and fa&s;tened round the wai&s;t with a belt. Under the gown, they wear a wai&s;tcoat of the &s;ame materials, a coar&s;e &s;hirt, trow&s;ers, and &s;hoes. The dre&s;s of the women is the &s;ame, only in&s;tead of trow&s;ers, they wear petticoats, and when they leave their nunnery (for &s;uch it is) they muf|fie up their faces in their capuchins. The diet of the Dunkards con&s;i&s;ts of vegetables; but it is no principle with them to ab&s;tain from animal food, only they think that &s;uch ab&s;tinence is mo&s;t agree|able to a Chri&s;tian life. This temperance emaci|ates their bodies, and, as the men indulge their beards to grow to their full length, gives them a hollow, gha&s;tly appearance. Their beds are no better than benches; a little wooden block &s;erves them for a pillow; and they celebrate public wor|&s;hip twice every day, and as often every night. But though &s;uch modes of life appear ab&s;urd and im|practicable, the Dunkards are far from being ex|travagant. Their chapel is very decent; and they have, upon a fine &s;tream, a gri&s;t-mill, a paper-mill, an oil-mill, and a mill for pearl-barley, all of them mo&s;t ingeniou&s;ly con&s;tructed by them&s;elves: they have even a printing-pre&s;s; and they are, e&s;pe|cially the nuns, extremely ingenious in working, and in embelli&s;hments, which they perform with a
<PB N="312" REF="3130">
variety of beautiful colours, with gilding, in imi|tation of the initials in antient manu&s;cripts; and they &s;tick them up, by way of ornament, in their churches and cells. By tho&s;e different manufac|tures, the public &s;tock of this a&s;cetic people is well &s;upplied, as no denomination of Chri&s;tians can be their enemies, their religious tenets being mingled with the ab&s;urdities of all. Notwith&s;tanding the two &s;exes live &s;eparate from one another in their town, yet the Dunkards are far from being aver&s;e to matrimony. In that ca&s;e, the parties mu&s;t in|deed leave the town; but they are &s;upplied out of the public fund with whatever is nece&s;&s;ary for their &s;ettling el&s;ewhere. This they generally do as near as they can to Ephrata, to which they &s;end their children for education. The Dunkards admini&s;ter bapti&s;m by dipping or plunging, but to adult per|&s;ons only: they hold free-will, and think that the doctrine of original &s;in, as to its effect upon A|dam's po&s;terity, is ab&s;urd and impious: they di&s;|claim violence, even in ca&s;es of &s;elf-defence; and &s;uffer them&s;elves to be defrauded or wronged, ra|ther than go to law: they are &s;uper&s;titious to the la&s;t degree in ob&s;erving their &s;abbath; and all their prayers and preachings, during their wor&s;hip, are extempore: humility, cha&s;tity, temperance, and other Chri&s;tian virtues, are commonly the &s;ubjects of their di&s;cour&s;es; and they imagine, that the &s;ouls of dead Chri&s;tians are employed in converting tho&s;e of the dead who had no opportunity of knowing the go&s;pel: they deny the eternity of hell's torments; but believe in certain temporary ones, that will be inflicted on infidels, and ob&s;tinate per|&s;ons, who deny Chri&s;t to be their only Saviour; but they think, that at a certain period all will be admitted to the endle&s;s fruition of the Deity. A people who&s;e principles are &s;o harmle&s;s, and who&s;e practice is &s;o &s;imple and virtuous, cannot be
<PB N="313" REF="3140">
otherwi&s;e than happy upon earth. Among them&s;elves they know nothing but harmony and mutual af|fection; every one chearfully performs the ta&s;k of indu&s;try a&s;&s;igned to him, and their ho&s;pitality to &s;trangers is unbounded; but their principles lead them to take nothing in recompence.</P>

<HEAD>MARYLAND.</HEAD>
<P>This province is bounded to the we&s;t by the A|palachian mountains; to the ea&s;t by Che&s;apeak Bay, and the Northern Ocean; to the &s;outh by Patowmack River; and to the north by Dela|ware Bay; lying between 37&deg;. 50&prime;. and 40&deg;. north latitude, and extending about one hundred and forty miles in length, and one hundred and thirty|five in breadth. It had the name of Maryland from Henrietta Maria, daughter of Henry IV. of France, and queen to king Charles I. of England, who granted it by patent to Cecilius Calvert, lord Baltimore, anno 1632.</P>
<P>The air of this province is &s;aid to be exce&s;&s;ive hot &s;ome part of the &s;ummer, and equally cold in winter, when the north-we&s;t wind blows; but the winters are not of more than three or four months duration, and in the&s;e they have &s;eldom one month of bad weather: all the re&s;t, they are happy in a clear air and bright &s;un, and are &s;carce ever troubled with fogs. In this, and in all the other colonies, the air continually acquires a greater degree of &s;alubrity in proportion as the land is cleared, and the country inhabited.</P>
<P>Maryland may be divided into the low lands, next the &s;ea, and the hilly country, lying towards the Apalachian mountains. It is watered by in|numerable &s;prings, forming a great many fine ri|vers, of which the chief are Patowmack, Pocomo|ac, Patuxhent, Severn, Cheptouk, Sa&s;&s;afras, and
<PB N="314" REF="3150">
Wicomocca rivers, and that of St. George. The&s;e and other rivers, capable of receiving large &s;hips, with the numerous bays and creeks that indent the land on every &s;ide, give the &s;eamen an opportunity of bringing their ve&s;&s;els up to the planters doors. The chief bays are tho&s;e of Che&s;epeak and Dela|ware, and the mo&s;t noted cape that of Henlopen, at the entrance of Delaware Bay. The bay of Che&s;epeak divides the province into two parts; of which one lies on the ea&s;t, and the other on the we&s;t.</P>
<P>The chief commodity is tobacco, of which it is &s;aid to have exported annually, many years ago, upwards of thirty thou&s;and hog&s;heads, each hog&s;head &s;even hundred pounds weight. This commodity forms the medium of currency of Maryland, being re|ceived in debts and taxes; and the in&s;pector's notes for tobacco, delivered to him, are transfera|ble. It is &s;aid, that an indu&s;trious man can ma|nage &s;ix thou&s;and plants of tobacco, and four acres of Indian corn. The tobacco of this pro|vince, called Oroonoko, is &s;tronger than that of Virginia; and, though not much liked or u&s;ed in England, yet, in the ea&s;tern and northern parts of Europe, it is preferred before the &s;weet &s;cented to|bacco of James and York rivers, in Virginia. Another con&s;iderable commodity of Maryland is pork, of which large quantities are exported, &s;alted and barreled; the woods containing va&s;t droves of wild &s;wine, which are generally of a &s;mall &s;ize. Good land in Maryland yields about fifteen bu&s;hels of wheat an acre, or thirty bu&s;hels of Indian corn; but the grain is &s;aid to be very &s;ubject to the wee|vil. Great quantities both of hemp and flax are rai&s;ed in this province, and the mountains yield abundance of iron ore, which is run into pigs, and refined into iron. Maryland oak is not great|ly e&s;teemed for building large &s;hips, but is very
<PB N="315" REF="3160">
proper for &s;taves, and &s;mall craft. Their black walnut is very proper for joiners work; and they have likewi&s;e poplars, cedars, che&s;nuts, and other woods, with mo&s;t of the different &s;pecies of grain and fruits, both of Europe and America.</P>
<P>The planters, generally &s;peaking, live in farms di&s;per&s;ed all over the country, chiefly near the banks of rivers, or on the &s;ea-coa&s;t. They &s;eem to have an aver&s;ion here, as well as in Virginia, to re&s;ide in towns, or rather they find it more conve|nient for the management of their plantations; and as the &s;ituation of the province has all along &s;ecured it, in a great mea&s;ure, from the incur&s;ions and ravages of the Indians, they have not found it nece&s;&s;ary to baulk their inclinations. Though the province is far from being well peopled, the in|habitants are computed at about eighty thou&s;and, exclu&s;ive of the negroes, who are very numerous. No planter can plant more than &s;ix thou&s;and plants of tobacco per negro, be&s;ides rai&s;ing &s;ome barrels of corn. The weekly allowance to each negro is a peck of Indian corn, and &s;ome &s;alt. Be&s;ides the manufactures we have mentioned, a kind of wool|len cloth is made here, and a wax extracted from the fruit of what they call the wax-tree, being a kind of myrtle, which, when mixed with tallow, makes candles. They likewi&s;e make excellent cyder for their own drinking; but they &s;uffer the grapes, of which they have va&s;t quantities in the woods, to rot upon the ground, though it is thought, if pro|perly cultivated, they would yield a thin whole-&s;ome wine.</P>
<P>The commodities imported into Maryland con|&s;i&s;t chiefly of wines, from Madeira, Fyal, and France; of rum, from Barbadoes; of &s;laves, from Africa; and of malt, beer, linens and woollens, furniture, uten&s;ils of every kind, and indeed mo&s;t
<PB N="316" REF="3170">
of the elegancies and conveniences of life, from England.</P>
<P>Maryland was di&s;covered in the year 1606, when Virginia was fir&s;t planted, and for &s;ome time was e&s;teemed a part of Virginia, till king Charles I. in 1632, granted all that part of Virginia which lay north of Patowmac river to the lord Baltimore, of the kingdom of Ireland, and his heirs. The Baltimore family were deprived of the government of this province during the civil wars in England, but recovered it again at the Re&s;toration; and they &s;till remain proprietors. The e&s;tate enjoyed by them here is the mo&s;t con&s;iderable of any &s;ub|ject of Great-Britain abroad; for, be&s;ides their plantations, they have certain revenues granted to them by &s;everal a&s;&s;emblies, as a duty on each hog&s;head of tobacco, and other incomes, which, with the &s;ale of lands, uncultivated and unpur|cha&s;ed, mu&s;t amount, at pre&s;ent, to a very con&s;ide|rable &s;um yearly.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t adventurers having been Roman ca|tholics, followed by many families of that per&s;ua|&s;ion, who came over from England to avoid the penal laws, many of the planters &s;till profe&s;s that religion: however, the church of England is e&s;ta|bli&s;hed here, and churches have not only been built, but pari&s;hes allotted to them with annual &s;tipends to the mini&s;ters; every Chri&s;tian male &s;ix|teen years old, and negroes male and female, above that age, paying forty pounds of tobacco, which is levied by the &s;heriff, among other public burdens, and yields about one hundred pounds &s;terling, at a medium, to each.</P>
<P>Maryland contains above a dozen counties, in which the chief places are Annapolis, St. Mary's, Dorche&s;ter, William&s;tadt, Harrington, Warring|ton, Calverton, Pi&s;cataway, Bri&s;tol, Baltimore, A|bington, Ma&s;terkout, St. Michael, and Bolingbroke.</P>
<P><PB N="317" REF="3180">
Annapolis was formerly called Severn, but re|ceived its pre&s;ent name in 1694, when it was made a port town, and the re&s;idence of a collector and naval officer. The county-court was removed hi|ther in 1699, and ever &s;ince it has always been the chief &s;eat of ju&s;tice, and held to be the capital of the province. Here is a free-&s;chool, as well as in &s;everal other places of the province. The pre&s;ent lieutenant-governor is Robert Eden, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR></P>

<HEAD>VIRGINIA.</HEAD>
<P>This province is bounded on the &s;outh by Ca|rolina; on the north-ea&s;t by the river Patowmack, which divides it from Maryland; on the ea&s;t by the Atlantic Ocean; and on the we&s;t by the Apalachian mountains; extending about two hun|dred and forty miles in length, and two hundred in breadth.</P>
<P>The air and &s;ea&s;ons here depend very much upon the wind, as to heat and cold, dryne&s;s and moi&s;ture. The north and north-we&s;t winds are very nitrous, piercing cold, and clear, or el&s;e &s;tormy; the &s;outh-ea&s;t and &s;outh, hazy and &s;ultry hot. In winter they have a fine clear air, and dry, which renders it very plea&s;ant. Their fro&s;ts are &s;hort; but &s;ometimes &s;o very &s;harp, that they will freeze the rivers over three miles broad. Snow falls &s;ometimes in pretty large quantities, but rarely lies above a day or two. Their &s;pring is about a month earlier than in England; in April they have frequent rains; in May and June, the heat increa&s;es; and the &s;ummer is much like ours, being mitigated with gentle breezes, that ri&s;e about nine o'clock, and decrea&s;e and increa&s;e as the &s;un ri&s;es or falls. In July and Augu&s;t the&s;e breezes cea&s;e, and the air becomes &s;tagnant and &s;ultry hot; in September the weather generally
<PB N="318" REF="3190">
changes &s;uddenly, and heavy rains fall, and then the inhabitants are generally very &s;ickly. It is to be ob&s;erved, however, that here, and in all our other colonies, as the cultivation and population of them advances, the air grows better, to which the cutting down of the woods greatly contribute.</P>
<P>As to the face of the country in Virginia, it is ge|nerally low and flat towards the &s;ea-coa&s;t, and for an hundred miles up the country; &s;o that there is hardly a hill or &s;tone to be &s;een, except here and there &s;ome rocks of iron ore, and &s;ome banks of a kind of pe|trified oy&s;ter-&s;hells. The whole country, before it was planted, was one continued fore&s;t, inter&s;per&s;ed with mar&s;hes, which in the We&s;t-Indies they call &s;wamps. No country now produces greater quan|tities of excellent tobacco, and yet the &s;oil is ge|nerally &s;o &s;andy and &s;hallow, that after they have cleared a fre&s;h piece of ground out of the woods, it will not bear tobacco pa&s;t two or three years, un|lel&s;s cow-penned, and well dunged.</P>
<P>The fore&s;ts here yield oaks, poplars, pines, ce|dars, cypre&s;&s;es, &s;weet myrtles, che&s;nuts, hickery, live oak, walnut, dog-wood, elder, hazel, chinka|pins, locu&s;t-trees, &s;a&s;&s;afras, elm, a&s;h, beech, with a great variety of &s;weet gums and incen&s;e, which di&s;til from &s;everal trees; pitch, tar, ro&s;in, turpen|tine, plank-timber, ma&s;ts, and yards. Virginia yields al&s;o rice, hemp, Indian corn, plenty of pa&s;|ture, with coal, quarries of &s;tone, and lead and iron ore.</P>
<P>Of &s;pontaneous flowers there are a great variety here, particularly the fine&s;t crown-imperial in the world, and the cardinal-flower, &s;o much extolled for its &s;carlet colour; almo&s;t the whole year round the plains and valleys are adorned with flowers of one kind or another. In this country al&s;o is found the tulip bearing laurel-tree, which has the
<PB N="319" REF="3200">
plea&s;ante&s;t &s;mell in the world, and keeps &s;eeding and blo&s;&s;oming &s;everal months together.</P>
<P>Silk gra&s;s grows &s;pontaneous in many places; the fibres of which are as fine as flax, and much &s;tronger than hemp. Their trees are much loftier than ours, and no underwood or bu&s;hes grow be|neath; &s;o that people travel with ea&s;e through the fore&s;ts on hor&s;eback, and never want a fine &s;hade to defend them from the &s;ummer heats.</P>
<P>Among other animals in Virginia are elks, but not common; red deer, in great plenty; mu&s;k rats, racoons, beavers, and wolves. As for rep|tiles, they have lizards, with &s;everal kinds of &s;nakes, particularly the rattle-&s;nake. Of birds, they have &s;everal &s;orts of eagles, hawks, and owls. The white owl is very beautiful, all the feathers of the back and brea&s;t being white as &s;il|ver, except a black &s;pot immediately below the throat: their turkies are very large, &s;ome of them weighing forty pounds: their partridges are &s;maller than ours, but very well ta&s;ted: their nightin|gales are well known in England: they have a bird called the mocking-bird, of two &s;orts, grey and red, e&s;teemed the fine&s;t &s;inging bird in the world; it has its name from imitating the notes of all other kinds of birds it hears: they have here al&s;o that beautiful little bird called the humming-bird.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the animals that are natives of the coun|try, mo&s;t of the quadrupeds of Europe have been introduced here; &s;uch as hor&s;es, cows, &s;heep, and hogs, which are prodigiou&s;ly multiplied, great numbers running wild in their fore&s;ts, be&s;ides what they have tame in their plantations. Beef and pork are &s;old from one penny to twopence a pound; their fatte&s;t pullets, at &s;ixpence a-piece; chickens, at three or four &s;hillings a dozen; gee&s;e, at ten|pence; and turkeys at eighteen-pence a-piece.
<PB N="320" REF="3210">
Fi&s;h, oy&s;ters, and wild-fowl, are the cheape&s;t food in the country in the &s;ea&s;on; and deer are &s;old from five to ten &s;hillings a piece. In February, March, April, and May, &s;hoals of herrings come up into their very brooks; &s;ome of the &s;ize of ours, but for the mo&s;t part much larger. Among many other &s;pecies, they have three &s;omewhat remarka|ble; namely, the &s;ting-gra&s;s, the toad-fi&s;h, and the tobacco-pipe fi&s;h. The &s;ting-gra&s;s takes its name from a &s;ting in its tail; the toad-fi&s;h, from its &s;welling mon&s;trou&s;ly when taken out of the water; and the tobacco-pipe fi&s;h, from its re&s;em|bling that in&s;trument: all the&s;e are eaten. They have great quantities, in &s;ummer, of tho&s;e de&s;truc|tive worms that eat into the bottoms of &s;hips, wherever they find the coat of pitch, tar, or lime, worn off the timber; the&s;e worms having a kind of horn or &s;crew in their head, with which they force a pa&s;&s;age through any wood to which they &s;tick.</P>
<P>Four great rivers, namely James River, York River, Rappahannock, and Patowmack, which ri&s;e in the Apalachian mountains, run through this province, or along its borders, from the north-we&s;t to the &s;outh-ea&s;t, and fall into the bay of Che&s;e|peak. James River is generally about two miles over, and navigable at lea&s;t four&s;core. York and Rappahannock are not &s;o large; but Patowmack, as we had occa&s;ion to ob&s;erve before, is navigable for near two hundred miles, being generally &s;even miles broad, and in &s;ome places nine. The great bay of Che&s;epeak runs up through Virginia and Maryland, almo&s;t due north, three hundred miles, and upwards, being navigable mo&s;t part of the way for large &s;hips. The two promontories that form the mouth of the bay, are called Cape Charles, and Cape Henry.</P>
<P><PB N="321" REF="3220">
The government here is formed upon the Eng|li&s;h model; the governor acts as the king, the council &s;upplies the place of a hou&s;e of lords, and the hou&s;e of repre&s;entatives that of the com|mons. The chief court, next to the a&s;&s;embly, is the general-court, held by the governor and coun|cil, who are judges of it, and take cognizance of all cau&s;es, criminal, penal, eccle&s;ia&s;tical, and civil. There lies no appeal from this court, unle&s;s the matter in di&s;pute amounts in value to above three hundred pounds; and then an appeal lies to the king and council in England. In criminal ca&s;es, there ne|ver was any appeal; but the governor can pardon per&s;ons for any crimes except murder, and reprieve, even for that, till his maje&s;ty's plea&s;ure is known. The governor, as repre&s;enting the king, has a ne|gative on all the acts of a&s;&s;embly; which he calls, prorogues, and di&s;&s;olves. He calls al&s;o, and pre|&s;ides in the council, makes ju&s;tices of the peace, and all the officers of the militia, under the degree of a lieutenant general: he i&s;&s;ues proclamations, keeps the &s;eal of the colony, di&s;po&s;es of the king's lands according to the charter, and the laws of the country: all payments out of the trea&s;ury are ordered by him, or in his name: he is vice-ad|miral, by virtue of a commi&s;&s;ion from the admi|ralty, and has a &s;alary of two thou&s;and pounds a-year, which, with an hundred and fifty pounds a-year for hou&s;e rent and perqui&s;ities, may amount to near three thou&s;and pounds. The king nomi|nates the coun&s;ellors; but the governor fills up the vacant places of &s;uch as die, or are removed, without &s;taying for orders from England. When the governor and deputy-governor are ab&s;ent, the admini&s;tration falls to the pre&s;ident of the coun|cil for the time being. The council have an equal vote with the governor, in calling a&s;&s;emblies, di&s;po&s;ing of the public revenues, placing and di&s;|placing
<PB N="322" REF="3230">
officers, in votes and orders of council, proclamations, grants, and patents. The privi|leges of the a&s;&s;embly-men are the &s;ame with tho&s;e of the members of parliament in England, and their power much the &s;ame as that of the hou&s;e of commons. The laws of Virginia are the acts of parliament and &s;tatutes of England, which extend to all his maje&s;ty's dominions in general; the &s;ta|tutes and acts of the a&s;&s;embly, which relate only to this colony, and mu&s;t be &s;ent to England to be confirmed by the king; and the orders of the king and council in England, which, in many things, have the force of laws in the Plantations.</P>
<P>There are &s;everal public officers, be&s;ides the go|vernor, who have their commi&s;&s;ions immediately from his maje&s;ty; particularly, the auditor of the revenue, the receiver-general, and the &s;ecretary, in who&s;e office is kept the public records, and all deeds and other writings proved. The eccle&s;ia&s;ti|cal commi&s;&s;ary receives his authority from the bi|&s;hop of London. The trea&s;urer of the province is appointed by the general-a&s;&s;embly, and receives the money rai&s;ed by the acts of that a&s;&s;embly.</P>
<P>As to the forces of the colony, every freeman, that is, all that are not &s;ervants, from &s;ixteen to &s;ixty years of age, are enli&s;ted in the militia, and are mu&s;tered once a year at a general mu&s;ter, and four times a-year by troops and companies, in their re&s;pective counties; and they are reckoned above two thou&s;and men; the whole inhabitants, men, women, and children, amounting to upwards of one hundred thou&s;and, and the &s;laves and &s;ervants to twice that number. However, the popula|tion of Virginia is not &s;uch as might have been expected from &s;o antient and flouri&s;hing a colony; nor are the towns of any con&s;iderable note. This la&s;t circum&s;tance is owing to the va&s;t commodiou&s;|ne&s;s of water-carriage, which every where pre&s;ents

it&s;elf to the plantations of private per&s;ons, and the &s;carcity of handicrafts. Virginia, however, is di&s;|tingui&s;hed by &s;everal magnificent public buildings&punc; it &s;till retains its original &s;taple manufacture and commodity of tobacco; and they carry on a great trade with the We&s;t-Indies, in lumber, pitch, tar, corn, and provi&s;ions; and with Britain, in flax, hemp, iron, &s;taves, and plank.</P>
<P>The public revenues ari&s;e from a rent re&s;erved by the crown of all lands granted by patent, a duty of two &s;hillings a hog&s;head on all tobacco ex|ported, a duty of &s;ix-pence a head for every pa&s;|&s;enger brought into the country, fines and for|feitures, duties on foreign liquors, and on &s;laves and &s;ervants imported, and, la&s;tly, money rai&s;ed by acts pa&s;&s;ed in the a&s;&s;emblies; be&s;ides the duties laid on tobacco, in the countries that produce it.</P>
<P>As to the religion of the Virginians, the body of the people are members of the church of England, intermixed with &s;ome quakers and pre&s;byterians. In each pari&s;h there is a church, built either with timber, brick, or &s;tone, and decently furni&s;hed with all things nece&s;&s;ary for the celebration of di|vine &s;ervice. In large pari&s;hes there is a chapel of ea&s;e, and &s;ometimes two, for the conveniency of the pari&s;hioners. The mini&s;ters maintenance is &s;ettled at &s;ixteen thou&s;and pounds of tobacco each yearly, be&s;ides perqui&s;ites. The power of induc|tion, upon the pre&s;entation of mini&s;ters, is lodged in the governor's hands by law. The bi&s;hop of London's commi&s;&s;ary, who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s it is to make vi&s;itations of churches, and &s;uperintend the clergy, is allowed one hundred pounds a-year.</P>
<P>Some attempts were made by Sir Walter Ra|leigh and others to &s;ettle colonies here, and at Ca|rolina, in the reign of queen Elizabeth; but all of them, through neglect, proved ineffectual, till James I. by his letters patent, dated the 10th of April

Hereupon having fitted out three &s;mall &s;hips, they &s;et &s;ail from the Downs the 5th of Janua|ry 1606, arrived in the Bay of Che&s;epeak, and &s;ail|ing up the river Powhatan, now James River, they landed on the penin&s;ula, about fifty miles up the ri|ver, where they built a fort, and afterwards a town, which they called James Town, in honour of king James I. This was the fir&s;t town built by the Eng|li&s;h on the continent of America. There happened &s;ome &s;kirmi&s;hes between the Engli&s;h and the natives at their landing; but the fear of fire-arms brought the latter to a pretended reconciliation, waiting, however, for an opportunity of falling upon the&s;e &s;trangers to advantage. The fort being furni&s;hed, captain Newport, who commanded the expedition, returned to England on the 22d of June 1607, leaving one hundred and four per&s;ons in the new &s;ettlement. The garri&s;on &s;oon finding them&s;elves in want of provi&s;ions, and the natives refu&s;ing to &s;up|ply them with any, tho' they offered to give them the full value for them, the Engli&s;h found them|&s;elves under the nece&s;&s;ity of plundering the coun|try, upon which an open war en&s;ued between them and the natives. However, fre&s;h &s;upplies and re|inforcements coming over, commanded by the lord Delaware, the Indians were glad to enter into a treaty of peace, during which the Engli&s;h finding a great demand for tobacco in Europe, began to encourage the planting of it, in which they &s;uc|ceeded beyond their expectations; and at the &s;ame time Sir George Yardly, the governor, e&s;tabli&s;hed a government, re&s;embling that of England; and the fir&s;t general-a&s;&s;embly met at James Town, in May 1620, and negroes were fir&s;t imported into Virginia

the &s;ame year. The planters, not long after, falling out among them&s;elves, the Indians took advantage of their divi&s;ions, and made &s;everal attempts to re|cover their country, killing great numbers of the Engli&s;h by &s;urprize The&s;e misfortunes being a&s;|cribed to the mal-admini&s;tration of the compa|ny, king Charles I. di&s;&s;olved it in the year 1626, and reduced the government of Virginia under his own immediate direction; appointing the gover|nor and council him&s;elf, ordering all proce&s;&s;es and patents to be i&s;&s;ued in his name, and re&s;erv|ing a quit-rent for every hundred acres of land. The planters, however, falling into factions and parties again, the Indians made a third effort to recover their lo&s;t liberties, and cut off near five hun|dred more of the Engli&s;h; but they were at length repul&s;ed, and Sir William Berkley, the then governor, afterwards made a peace with them, which continued a con&s;iderable time, during which he promoted manufactures of &s;ilk and linen, and was in all re&s;pects e&s;teemed an excellent governor; but the act of navigation re&s;training the planters from &s;ending their merchandize to foreign coun|tries, and from receiving cloathing, furniture, or &s;upplies from any country, but England, having created a great deal of di&s;content, Mr. Bacon, a popular factious gentleman, took advantage of their di&s;affection, and &s;etting up for him&s;elf, drew the people into rebellion, depo&s;ed the governor, and compelled him to fly to the ea&s;tern &s;hore of the Bay of Che&s;epeak; and had not Bacon died &s;oon after, he had probably made him&s;elf &s;overeign of Virginia. Upon his death Sir William returned to his government, and the people to their duty; &s;ince which there have been no material alterations in the &s;tate of Virginia; but they have hitherto al|mo&s;t entirely neglected the culture of &s;ilk, wine, and every other branch of bu&s;ine&s;s, which the &s;oil
<PB N="326" REF="3270">
and climate &s;eemed proper for, and employed them&s;elves wholly in planting and curing tobacco: however, it is to be hoped, that the premiums, of|fered by the &s;ociety for the encouragement of arts and manufactures in England, will be the means of procuring the&s;e more attention than has hitherto been paid to them, and they de&s;erved.</P>
<P>The Americans on the frontiers of Virginia, ac|cording to tho&s;e who have lived among them, are of a middling &s;tature, &s;trait and well proportioned, with the fine&s;t limbs in the world; nor is there a dwarf or mi&s;hapen per&s;on among them. Their colour is that of copper, rendered darker by grea&s;|ing them&s;elves, and being expo&s;ed to the weather. They have black eyes, and their hair is coal-black, which the men cut into &s;everal &s;hapes, and both men and women grea&s;e &s;o that it &s;hines. The better &s;ort wear a kind of coronet four or five inches broad, and open at top, compo&s;ed of a &s;ort of beads, and &s;ome a wreath of died furs; they have al&s;o bracelets on their necks and arms: but the common people go bare-headed, only they &s;tick large &s;hining feathers in their hair. Their cloaths are a large mantle, carele&s;ly wrapped round their bodies, and &s;ometimes girt clo&s;ely with a girdle. The common &s;ort only pa&s;s a piece of cloth or &s;tring round their middles, and put a piece of cloth or &s;kin between their thighs, which turn over the &s;tring at each end. Their &s;hoes, when they wear any, are made of an entire piece of buck&s;kin. The dre&s;s of the women differs little from that of the men, only the better &s;ort have more beads and bracelets. They commonly go naked as far as the navel downwards, and upwards to the middle of the thigh; their brea&s;ts are round and &s;mall, and never hang down as tho&s;e of the black women on the coa&s;t of Guinea. In&s;tead of keeping their children warm, they dip them over head and ears
<PB N="327" REF="3280">
in cold water, and afterwards tie them to a board, covered with &s;omewhat that is &s;oft, having a hole in it, through which they di&s;charge their excrements: they keep them &s;everal months in this po&s;ture, till the limbs begin to grow &s;trong; when they &s;uffer the child to crawl about as well as it can. They wor&s;hip the devil; pretending, if they did not pacify him, he would de&s;troy their health, peace, and plenty. Their prie&s;ts are high|ly reverenced by them, and are great pretend|ers to pawawing, or conjuring. The Indians al|ways con&s;ult them, before they go on any enter|prize. They reckon their years by winters; and divide them into five &s;ea&s;ons, the budding time, the earing of the corn, the &s;ummer, the harve&s;t, and the winter. The months they count by the moon. They divide the days into three parts; the ri&s;e, power, and lowering of the &s;un. They keep their accounts by knots on a &s;tring, or notch|es on a &s;tick. Their food is Indian corn, &s;oaked and boiled in water, beavers, turtle, &s;everal kinds of &s;nakes, broth made of deers humbles, pea&s;e, beans, &amp;c. When the Engli&s;h fir&s;t came among them, they had no iron tools; their knives were &s;harpen|ed reeds or &s;hells, and their axes &s;harp &s;tones. They felled trees by laying fire to their roots; and by fire they al&s;o hollowed them, and made ca|noes of them. Their way of producing fire was, by rubbing one &s;tick again&s;t another that was &s;ofter.</P>
<P>Virginia is divided into thirty-five counties, in which are above fifty pari&s;hes; but the only places that de&s;erve the name of towns, and are worth mentioning are William&s;burgh, and James Town. The former &s;tands in James County, between James and York Rivers, and is the &s;eat of the go|vernment, a&s;&s;embly, and chief courts. Here is
<PB N="328" REF="3290">
al&s;o a college, called William and Mary College, having been founded by king William, who gave two thou&s;and pounds towards it, and twenty thou|&s;and acres of land, with power to purcha&s;e and hold lands to the value of two thou&s;and pounds a|year, and a duty of one penny per pound on all tobacco exported to the other plantations. There is a pre&s;ident, &s;ix ma&s;ters or profe&s;&s;ors, and other officers, who are named by the governors or vi&s;it|ors. The college has now a pretty good income, and makes no contemptible figure. The Hon. Mr. Boyle made a very large donation to the col|leges for the education of Indian children. Be&s;ides the college, there are &s;ome other hand&s;ome edifices here; as the &s;tate-hou&s;e or capitol, the church, a magazine for arms and ammunition, a public pri|&s;on, a fort, a play-hou&s;e, &amp;c. There is al&s;o a large &s;quare for a market-place, with a bowling|green near it.</P>
<P>James Town &s;tands about twenty-&s;ix miles above the mouth of the river of that name, on the north &s;ide, in a penin&s;ula; but is little better than a village.</P>

<HEAD>NORTH and SOUTH CAROLINAS.</HEAD>
<P>The North and South Carolinas are bounded by Virginia on the north; by Georgia on the &s;outh; by the Atlantic Ocean on the ea&s;t; and by the A|palachian mountains on the we&s;t; containing all that part of North-America lying between 31 and 36&deg;. of north latitude; and extending along the coa&s;t about three hundred and fifty miles, and from two hundred to two hundred and &s;ixty backwards.</P>
<P>The face of the&s;e countries is low and level, for about one hundred miles we&s;t of the coa&s;t; hence they ri&s;e gradually to the Apalachian mountains,
<PB N="329" REF="3300">
which are about one hundred and fifty miles di&s;|tant from the Atlantic Ocean.</P>
<P>The &s;ituation of the Carolinas is &s;uch, that nei|ther the heat in &s;ummer nor the cold in winter are very violent; yet the former is rather more trou|ble&s;ome than the latter. They have &s;ometimes very heavy rains, both in &s;ummer and winter, with high winds, or rather hurricanes; but it is not often that they do much mi&s;chief. The north-we&s;t wind, even in &s;ummer, blows exceeding &s;harp, and is apt to bring di&s;tempers on tho&s;e who do not take care to guard again&s;t it; but &s;uch as expo&s;e not them&s;elves unnece&s;&s;arily to the&s;e, or the cold breezes of the evening and night after a hot day, and live regularly, for the mo&s;t part enjoy a good &s;tate of health; for the weather is generally clear, &s;erene, and plea&s;ant.</P>
<P>The &s;oil of the&s;e provinces is &s;o fertile, that ve|getables of all &s;orts either actually grow there, or would grow, if properly cultivated; particularly vines, wheat, rice, Indian corn, barley, oats, pea&s;e, beans, hemp, flax, cotton, tobacco, indigo, olives; orange, citron, cypre&s;s, &s;a&s;&s;afras, oak, walnut, ca&s;|&s;ia, and pine trees, and white mulberry trees, for feeding &s;ilk-worms; &s;ar&s;aparilla; and pines, which yield turpentine, ro&s;in, tar, and pitch. There is a kind of tree, from which runs an oil of extraordi|nary virtue for curing wounds, and another, which yields a balm, thought to be little inferior to that of Mecca. There are other trees, be&s;ides the&s;e, that yield gums. The Carolinas produce likewi&s;e prodigious quantities of honey, of which they make excellent &s;pirits, and mead as good as Malaga &s;ack. About eighty thou&s;and barrels of rice, at a me|dium, are produced yearly in the Carolinas, each weighing four hundred pounds; of which the greater part is exported. Be&s;ides rice, the Caro|linians
<PB N="330" REF="3310">
cultivate &s;ome tobacco; but their chie trade lies in provi&s;ions; for they &s;upply Jamaica Barbadoes, and the Leeward I&s;lands, with beef pork, grain, pea&s;e, butter, &s;uet, raw hides, and leather. They likewi&s;e &s;end to the &s;ame i&s;land+tar, turpentine, timber, ma&s;ts, and furs; but the la&s;t are of an inferior kind. Maize, or Indian corn, thrives here exceedingly; but, in &s;ome other re&s;pects, the product has not been an&s;werable to the expectation from the &s;oil and climate. Though many parts of Carolina, e&s;pecially on the &s;ea coa&s;t, abound with vines; yet no progre&s;s worth men+tioning has been made in producing wine. Their manufactures of &s;ilk, notwith&s;tanding the great quantities of mulberry-trees they have, are not yet con&s;iderable; but, from &s;ome &s;amples that have been brought over, it appears equal in quality to any we purcha&s;e from foreigners. Though cochi|neal is &s;aid to be found here, the inhabitants &s;eem to neglect the profits ari&s;ing from that in&s;ect; and, for &s;ome years, their attention has been chief|ly turned towards making indigo.</P>
<P>The Carolinians take from Great-Britain all kinds of woollen and linen drapery, hardware, &s;trong beer, cyder, rai&s;ins, potters-earth, tobacco-pipes, paper, coverlids, mattre&s;&s;es, hats, &s;tockings, gloves, tin ware, powder and &s;hot, gun-flints, cordage, looking-gla&s;&s;es and gla&s;s-ware, thread, haberda&s;h|ery, and &s;mall wares. From Jamaica, Barbadoes, and the Leeward I&s;lands, they have &s;ugar, rum, mola&s;&s;es, cotton, chocolate, negroes, and &s;ilver. From New-England, New-York, and Pen&s;ylva|nia, wheat flour, wheat being very backward in the Carolinas; and hardwares and wine, from Ma|deira, and the other i&s;lands in the We&s;tern Ocean. The quantity of rice which Carolina produces is daily increa&s;ing, as indeed are all the other branches of its commerce; for which rea&s;on, we &s;hall not
<PB N="331" REF="3320">
offer any conjectures concerning the quantity of &s;hipping which it employs, or the benefit it is of to its mother-country. Some years ago, the pa|per-currency of South-Carolina amounted to two hundred and fifty thou&s;and pounds &s;terling, and that of North to fifty-two thou&s;and. The Briti&s;h money, that circulates among the Carolinians, is very incon&s;iderable; but they have French and Spani&s;h money, in dollars and pieces of eight.</P>
<P>The Engli&s;h traffic here with the natives for deer, bear, and buffalo &s;kins; for which they give them guns, powder, knives, &s;ci&s;&s;ars, look|ing-gla&s;&s;es, beads, &s;ome coar&s;e cloth, and duffils. The&s;e are carried on pack-hor&s;es five or &s;ix hundred miles into the country we&s;t of Charles Town; but mo&s;t of the trade is confined within the limits of the Creek and Cherokee nations, which do not lie above three hundred miles from the coa&s;t.</P>
<P>The native animals here are nearly the &s;ame as tho&s;e of Mexico and Florida, which we &s;hall &s;oon have occa&s;ion to mention; in particular, they have the urus, which the Engli&s;h improperly call a buf|falo. The European cattle are va&s;tly increa&s;ed in this, as in the other plantations: the wool of their &s;heep is not inferior to the Engli&s;h. There is great plenty of poultry, and other fowls; but manual labour is remarkably dear in this country.</P>
<P>The chief rivers of the Carolinas are, Albemarle River, Pentague, Nen&s;e, Cape Fear or Clarendon River, Wateree, Santee, A&s;hley River, Cooper River, Colliton, Cambahee, and Savannah, which &s;eparates South-Carolina from Georgia. The ocean is &s;o &s;hallow near the coa&s;t, that a &s;hip of any great burden cannot approach it, except in &s;ome few places. There has not yet been found one good harbour in North-Carolina; the be&s;t are tho&s;e of Roanoak, at the mouth of Albemarle River, and Pimlico. In South-Carolina are the harbours of
<PB N="332" REF="3330">
Winyaw or George Town, Charles Town, and Port Royal. The chief capes are, Cape Hatteras, Cape Fear, and Cape Carteret.</P>
<P>The method of &s;ettling in this plea&s;ant country has hitherto been, to pitch upon a void piece of ground, and either to purcha&s;e it at the rate of twenty pounds for one thou&s;and acres, and one &s;hil|ling quit-rent for every hundred acres, or el&s;e pay a penny an acre quit-rent yearly to the proprietors, without purcha&s;e-money; the former method is the mo&s;t common, and the tenure a freehold. The land being laid out, the purcha&s;er builds upon it, rai&s;es &s;tock, plants orchards, and makes &s;uch com|modities as when &s;old procure him &s;laves, hou&s;e|hold-goods, and other conveniences; and after this is done, he may yearly increa&s;e his capital, and by indu&s;try become rich.</P>
<P>Among the Indian nations behind the Carolinas, the mo&s;t con&s;iderable are the Creeks and Chero|kees, of whom the men are generally tall, but the women little: they anoint their bodies with oil, and expo&s;e them to the &s;un, which occa|&s;ions their &s;kins to be of a dark brown: the men paint them&s;elves of various colours, red, blue, yellow, and black; they wear generally a girdle, with a piece of cloth drawn between their legs, and turned over the girdle, both before and behind, which looks &s;omething like breeches. The wo|men wear a kind of petticoat to their knees: both mon and women in the winter wear mantles two yards &s;quare, which they wrap round their bodies, as the Romans did their toga, generally keeping their arms bare. They are very healthful, and have hardly any di&s;ea&s;es, except tho&s;e occa&s;ioned by drinking rum, and the &s;mall-pox; tho&s;e who do not drink are exceeding long-lived. Their food, in&s;tead of bread, is Indian corn, boiled and &s;ea&s;oned, like ha&s;ty-pudding; and this is called
<PB N="333" REF="3340">
hommony: they al&s;o boil veni&s;on, and make broth of it, and eat all manner of fle&s;h. They are a ge|nerous good-natured people, and very humane to &s;trangers; patient in want and pain, &s;low to an|ger, and not ea&s;ily provoked; but when they are thoroughly incen&s;ed, they are implacable; very quick of apprehen&s;ion, and gay of temper; their public conferences &s;hew them to be men of ge|nius, and they have a natural eloquence.</P>
<P>Carolina was the la&s;t country in America planted by the Engli&s;h, after Sir Walter Raleigh's unfortu|nate attempt to &s;ettle colonies there in the reign of queen Elizabeth. It &s;eems to have been entirely overlooked, till the re&s;toration of Charles II. The mini&s;try being informed, that Carolina would pro|duce wine, oil, and &s;ilk, and almo&s;t every thing that England wanted, procured a patent or grant to them&s;elves, dated the 24th of March 1663, of great part of this coa&s;t; the grantees being Edward earl of Clarendon, lord-chancellor; George, duke of Albemarle, the general; William, lord Cra|ven; John, lord Berkley; the lord Anthony A&s;h|ley Cooper; Sir George Carteret; Sir William Colleton; and their heirs. The&s;e proprietors, however, did little towards planting it, until the year 1670, when lord A&s;hley &s;truck out a whim&s;i|cal kind of government for the colony, erecting a palatine or &s;overeign, with a council to be a check upon him; which involved them in perpetual quarrels, and almo&s;t de&s;troyed the plantation, as &s;oon as it was &s;ettled; to prevent which, they were at length obliged to &s;ell their &s;hares to the crown; and it is now a royal government, only the an|ce&s;tor of the earl of Granville thought fit to re|tain his &s;eventh &s;hare. The pre&s;ent governor of North-Carolina is William Tryon, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> and of the South, lord Charles Greville Montague.</P>
<P><PB N="334" REF="3350">
Both North and South Carolina are divided into counties, and the&s;e again into pari&s;hes or town &s;hips.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t planters in Albemarle county, were wards the north, upon what is called Albemarle River; but mo&s;t of them afterwards removed, for conveniency, to A&s;hley River. This county is inter&s;ected with rivers, on the banks of which dwell many Indians. South of Albemarle is Cla|rendon county, the Indians of which are the mo&s;t barbarous of any in the province. The&s;e two counties form what is properly called the govern|ment of North-Carolina; and are in a way at pre|&s;ent of being greatly improved, and of rivalling, if not exceeding, South-Carolina. The tobacco which North-Carolina produces is by the inhabi|tants &s;old to the Virginians, who &s;end it to Eng|land.</P>
<P>Craven county is inhabited, be&s;ides Engli&s;h, by a con&s;iderable number of French families. It lies upon the borders of Congaree or Santee River, which divides South from North-Carolina, and &s;ends ten members to the a&s;&s;embly.</P>
<P>South of this lies Berkley county, containing the two fine rivers of Cooper and A&s;hley. Upon a neck of land, between the&s;e two rivers, &s;tands Charles Town, the capital of the province. A&s;h|ley River is navigable for &s;hips twenty miles above the town, and for near forty for boats and petti|augers, or large canoes. Charles Town is the great mart of the province; but no &s;hips of above two hundred tons can pa&s;s its bar. Its neighbour|hood may vie for beauty with any country in the world; and a little expence would make its fortifi|cations &s;trong, ornamental, and u&s;eful. At pre&s;ent it &s;tands as fair as any city to become the capital of North-America. Some of its hou&s;es are brick, others of wood, but all of them hand&s;ome and elegant;
<PB N="335" REF="3360">
and the church is the mo&s;t magnificent of any pro|te&s;tant one on the continent of America. The French, the pre&s;byterians, and the quakers, have all their &s;everal places of wor&s;hip. Here the go|vernor re&s;ides, the a&s;&s;embly &s;its, the courts of ju|dicature are held, and the bu&s;ine&s;s of the province is tran&s;acted. Dorche&s;ter is another thriving town in this di&s;trict.</P>
<P>South of Berkley county lies that of Colliton, the north-ea&s;t parts of which are full of Indians. The two chief rivers of this county are North-Edi&s;tow and South-Edi&s;tow, the banks of which are full of thriving plantations; and on tho&s;e of North-Edi&s;tow lies Wilton, or New-London, built under the direction of a Swi&s;s gentleman, call|ed Luberbuller.</P>
<P>Granville county is the mo&s;t &s;outherly of any in Carolina, and lies along the river Savannah. In this county is a Swi&s;s &s;ettlement called Purry&s;|burgh, and the river and harbour of Port-Royal, which is one of the fine&s;t in all America. Though it was the late&s;t &s;ettled, on account of its neigh|bourhood to the Spaniards, it is now the mo&s;t pro|mi&s;ing of any in South-Carolina. The Vaudois, at Purry&s;burgh, apply them&s;elves, with great dili|gence and &s;ucce&s;s, to the culture of &s;ilk.</P>

<HEAD>GEORGIA.</HEAD>
<P>In the year 1732, a number of public-&s;pirited gentlemen, taking into con&s;ideration the va&s;t be|nefit that might ari&s;e from the tract of land lying between the Savannah river and the river Alata|maha, which is contained in Charles the Second's charter, and undoubtedly belonged to England, formed a &s;cheme of making it &s;ub&s;ervient to many noble purpo&s;es, by erecting it into a bulwark for our &s;outhern colonies again&s;t the Spaniards; of
<PB N="336" REF="3370">
of producing great benefits to the mother-country but, above all, of giving employment to va&s;t num+bers of people who were burthen&s;ome at home to their friends and pari&s;hes; and petitioned the king for a charter, which was accordingly granted them This charter, which was dated that year, con&s;ti|tuted them a corporation, by the name of Tru&s;|tees for e&s;tabli&s;hing a colony in Georgia, includ|ing all that country &s;ituated in South-Carolina, which lies from the mo&s;t northern &s;tream of the Savannah river, along the coa&s;t, to the mo&s;t &s;outhern &s;tream of the Alatamaha, and we&s;t from the heads of the &s;aid rivers re&s;pectively, in a direct line, to the South-Sea. The corporation was ve&s;ted with all the nece&s;&s;ary powers, for the term of twenty-one years from the date of the charter; particularly, to collect benefactions for fitting out the emigrants, and &s;upporting them, till their hou&s;es could be built, and their lands cleared. General Oglethorpe, one of the tru&s;tees, a gentle|man of unbounded benevolence and public &s;pirit, commanded the fir&s;t embarkation to Georgia, to whom the Creek nation voluntarily relinqui&s;hed their right to all the lands lying between the above-mentioned rivers, which they did not u&s;e them&s;elves. Upon this, Mr. Oglethorpe laid out the town of Savannah; and erected &s;everal forts, to cover the colony again&s;t any ho&s;tile attempts of the Spaniards or Indians. In the year 1734, a con|&s;iderable number of prote&s;tant Saltzburghers went over, who, with others of their countrymen, who followed, were &s;ettled in a town on the Savannah, which they called Ebenezer; and, by their habits of indu&s;try and &s;obriety, they &s;oon became a con&s;i|derable &s;ettlement. In 1734, another embarka|tion, con&s;i&s;ting of three hundred men, one hun|dred and ten women, one hundred and two boys, and eighty-three girls, arrived from England, mo&s;t
<PB N="337" REF="3380">
of them at the public expence. In 1735, one hundred and &s;ixty Scotch Highlanders, all able-bo|died men, went over, and &s;ettled them&s;elves upon Alatamaha River, &s;ixteen miles by water from the i&s;land of St. Simon. They gave the name of Da|rien to a &s;mall fort they built there, and that of New-Inverne&s;s to a &s;mall town they afterwards added to it. In February 1736, Mr. Oglethorpe, with about three hundred pa&s;&s;engers on board two &s;hips, anchored in the road of Savannah, and &s;oon after laid the foundations of the town and fort of Frederica. Be&s;ides the private benefactions received by the tru&s;tees during the term of their charter, large &s;upplies were granted by parliament. In 1739, a &s;pecimen of Georgian raw &s;ilk was exhibited in London, which the merchants, who dealt in that commodity, declared to be as good as any raw &s;ilk that came from Italy, and worth at lea&s;t twenty &s;hillings per pound. In 1742, about five or &s;ix thou&s;and Spaniards and Indians invaded Georgia, from St. Augu&s;tine, in about fifty ve&s;&s;els of all kinds; but were repul&s;ed by general Oglethorpe, at the head of the Engli&s;h forces, and a &s;mall bo|dy of Indians, under Tomo Chichi's &s;on. From that time it remained undi&s;turbed, but not out of danger from the Spaniards, till the reduction of St. Augu&s;tine, and the ce&s;&s;ion not only of that town, but of all Florida, by the la&s;t peace.</P>
<P>Whatever might be the cau&s;e, it is certain, this infant colony drooped and langui&s;hed from the year 1742, till Mr. Ellis was appointed governor; but under his admini&s;tration, it became again of &s;uch importance, that his pre&s;ent maje&s;ty, upon removing him to another government, rewarded him with a hand&s;ome pre&s;ent of money for his ad|mini&s;tration of that of Georgia.</P>
<P>Though &s;ome parts of Georgia are le&s;s proper for cultivation than others, it is univer&s;ally allowed
<PB N="338" REF="3390">
to be a rich and delicious country in general, pro|ducing Indian corn, oats, barley, potatoes, pump|kins, melons, cucumbers, green peas, and garden|beans, with &s;allading of all kinds, throughout the year. Nectarines, plumbs, and peaches grow here in great abundance, and might, by cultivation, be rendered equal, if not &s;uperior, to any in Europe. The grapes grow wild, and are ripe in June; and Engli&s;h apple and pear trees, and &s;ometimes apri|cot trees, agree with the &s;oil. The white and black mulberry afford excellent nouri&s;hment for the &s;ilk worms, the propagation of which was one of the great inducements for &s;ettling the colony. Oranges and olives thrive, e&s;pecially in the &s;outhern parts, to the greate&s;t perfection. Their chief tim|ber trees are oaks, of which they have &s;ix or &s;even kinds, pines, hickery, cedar, cypre&s;s, walnut, &s;a&s;&s;a|fras, beech trees, and many others, for which the Europeans have no names; be&s;ides a great variety of flowering &s;hrubs.</P>
<P>Georgia produces variety of game, from the be|ginning of November to March; &s;uch as a &s;mall kind of woodcocks and partridges, turkies weigh|ing from twenty to thirty pounds, turtle-doves, wild-gee&s;e, ducks, teal, widgeons, with great quan|tities of wild pigeons; not to mention other birds, little known in Europe. In the &s;ummer-time the inhabitants kill deer, and in winter ducks. They have likewi&s;e the po&s;&s;om, or, as they call it, the opo&s;&s;om, which &s;huts up its young in a fal&s;e belly, and are &s;aid to be excellent food, as well as racoons. Tygers are very common in this country, and bears, who&s;e cubs eat like young pigs. Their woods abound al&s;o with wild cattle, and wolves and &s;nakes; but none of the la&s;t are venemous, ex|cept the rattle-&s;nake, for the bite of which the na|tives have a ready and infallible cure. Their rivers are pe&s;tered with &s;harks and alligators; but, at the
<PB N="339" REF="3400">
&s;ame time, their coa&s;ts are &s;tored with trout, mullet, whitings, and a va&s;t variety of other fi&s;h, which are both cheap and good. They have va&s;t quan|tities of oy&s;ters; but they are not &s;o delicious as tho&s;e of England. They have likewi&s;e clams, mu&s;cles, and very large prawns.</P>
<P>There are &s;everal i&s;lands on the coa&s;t of this co|lony; the chief are Amelia, Cumberland, and St. Simon's I&s;land. The fir&s;t, lying &s;even leagues to the north of St. Augu&s;tine, is about two miles broad, and thirteen long. The &s;econd, lying about twenty-one miles &s;outh of Frederica, forms the in|let of Amelia Sound, which it commands, by means of a fort called Fort William, and has fine &s;prings of water. The third, lying near the northern mouth of the Alatamaha, is &s;aid to be a|bout three miles in breadth, and forty-five in length. In the middle of this i&s;land &s;tands Frederica, which is well fortified, and has a regular magi&s;tracy.</P>
<P>The town of Savannah lies ten miles up the river of that name, where it forms a half moon, and where &s;hips, that draw ten or twelve feet water, may ride for a mile, within ten yards of the bank. Oppo&s;ite to it is an i&s;land of very rich pa&s;turage. The river is pretty wide, and the water fre&s;h; and from the key of the town, you &s;ee the whole cour&s;e of it towards the &s;ea, with the i&s;land Tybec, which forms the mouth of the river; and, the other way, you &s;ee the river for about &s;ixty miles up into the country. Savannah and Frederica are now con&s;iderable towns.</P>
<P>When the property of Carolina was purcha&s;ed by his late maje&s;ty, orders were i&s;&s;ued for building eleven towns here and in Carolina; each of which was to have a di&s;trict of twenty thou&s;and acres of land &s;quare, to be divided into &s;hares of five acres for each man, woman, or child of one family, which was to be augmented, as the planters &s;hould
<PB N="340" REF="3410">
be in a condition to cultivate a larger quantity: each town was al&s;o to be formed into a pari&s;h, the extent whereof was to be about &s;ix miles round; and, as &s;oon as the pari&s;h contained one hundred ma&s;ters of families, it was qualified to &s;end two members to the a&s;&s;embly of the province, and to enjoy the &s;ame privileges as any of the other pro|vinces: the ground round each town, being mark|ed out, was to belong in common to all the inha|bitants, till &s;hared out to each of them: there were to be three hundred acres of land near each town to be common for ever, without being charged with rent; and no per&s;on, by virtue of any former grant, was to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of any land within &s;ix miles of each town: the rent payable for every hundred acres, after ten years, was to be four &s;hillings a-year; and to every European &s;ervant, whether male or female, fifty acres of land were al&s;o to be di&s;tributed, free of all rent, for ten years.

<HEAD>FLORIDA.</HEAD>
<P>Florida, which was ceded to Great-Britain by the late treaty of peace, and, including a part of Loui&s;iana, is now divided into the govern|ments of Ea&s;t and We&s;t Florida, terminates to the &s;outh on the Gulph of Mexico; to the north, on the Apalachian and Cherokee mountains, or the Great Lakes; to the ea&s;t, on Georgia, the Atlantic Ocean, the Channel of Bahama, and the Gulph of Florida; and, to the we&s;t, its bound|aries are, a line drawn along the middle of the ri|ver Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi, from its &s;ource to the river Iber|ville, and from thence, by a line drawn along the middle of that river and the Lakes Maurepas and Pontchartrain, to the &s;ea. It is of a va&s;t extent,
<PB N="341" REF="3420">
&s;tretching, it is &s;aid, near one thou&s;and miles in length; but its breadth varies greatly, a con&s;idera|ble part of it con&s;i&s;ting of a penin&s;ula, which grows gradually narrower, till it terminates in a point.</P>
<P>Florida, properly &s;o called, was fir&s;t di&s;covered in 1497, by John Cabot, a Venetian mariner, in the &s;ervice of Henry VII. King of England. It was more compleatly di&s;covered in the year 1512 by Juan Ponce de Leon, a Spaniard, who gave it the name of Florida, becau&s;e it was fir&s;t &s;een in Ea&s;ter, called Pa&s;qua de Flores, in the language of his country; or, as Herrera alledges, becau&s;e it was covered with flowers, and the mo&s;t beauti|ful blo&s;&s;oms.</P>
<P>A country &s;o exten&s;ive mu&s;t vary &s;omewhat in point of air and climate; but it may, upon the whole, be called very warm, though the great heats in the &s;outhern parts are much allayed by the cool breezes from the &s;ea; and &s;uch as are more inland, towards the north, feel a little of the roughne&s;s of the north-we&s;t wind, which, more or le&s;s, diffu&s;es its chilling breath over the whole continent of North-America, carrying fro&s;t and &s;now many degrees more to the &s;outhward in the&s;e regions, than the north-ea&s;t wind does in ours.</P>
<P>On the American continent the winters are cold and &s;evere, as far as 34 or 35 degrees of north la|titude, which is farther to the &s;outh than the Streights of Gibraltar in Europe, and va&s;t &s;hoals of ice are &s;een floating in the &s;ea, which is frequently frozen to a &s;mall di&s;tance from the &s;hore, in the latitude of 44 or 45 degrees north, which are the &s;ame parallels under which the &s;outhern parts of France lie. This difference in the climate may perhaps, in a great mea&s;ure, be accounted for, by con&s;idering the amazing extent of uncultivated land covered with fore&s;ts, and intermixed with va&s;t lakes and mar&s;hes, over which the north wind in America blows. The air, however, is pure and
<PB N="342" REF="3430">
whole&s;ome, as evidently appears from the &s;ize, vigour, and longevity of the Floridan Indians, in all which re&s;pects they far exceed the Mexicans.</P>
<P>The &s;oil, except on the &s;ea coa&s;t, is rich and fertile, producing frequently two or three crops of Indian corn in the year, and might, with pro|per cultivation, be made to bear every &s;ort of grain. Here are all kinds of timber and fruit trees, e&s;pecially pines, laurels, palms, cedars, cy|pre&s;s, and che&s;nut trees, which grow to an ex|traordinary length and &s;ize, and, with the oaks, afford nouri&s;hment to &s;wine: but the wood mo&s;t prized, and in greate&s;t plenty, is the &s;a&s;&s;afras, of which con&s;iderable quantities are exported. Excel|lent limes and prunes al&s;o grow here in great abun|dance, with vines of various &s;orts, and cotton trees, hemp, flax, pul&s;e, roots, and herbs; and there is no &s;carcity of game, fowl, and fi&s;h, where &s;ufficient indu&s;try is exerted to procure the&s;e gifts of nature. The root mendihoca, of which the ca&s;&s;ava flour and bread are made, is very com|mon; and there is a kind of grain, like our oats, that &s;hoots up &s;pontaneou&s;ly in mar&s;hy places, and by the &s;ides of rivers. Of the fruits, there is one called tuna, &s;o exqui&s;ite and whole&s;ome, when ripe, that among the Europeans it goes by the name of the cordial julep. Excellent beef, veal, and mutton are the produce of the country, together with hor&s;es fit for draught and carriage, &s;o cheap, that they may be purcha&s;ed for the value of a crown in European commodities. The other pro|ducts of Florida are ambergrea&s;e, cochineal, in|digo, &s;ilk-gra&s;s; amethy&s;ts, turquoi&s;es, lapis la|zuli, and other precious &s;tones; copper, quick|&s;ilver, pit-coal, iron ore, and a kind of &s;tone-pitch, called copea, which the Spaniards u&s;ed as tar for their &s;hipping: pearls al&s;o are found on the coa&s;ts of Florida.</P>

Of the mountains, the mo&s;t con&s;iderable are the Apalachian, which divide Carolina, and the re&s;t of the Briti&s;h plantations, from Florida. A va&s;t num|ber of noble rivers pa&s;s through this country, mo&s;t of which ri&s;e in the Apalachian mountains, and fall into the Gulph of Mexico, or the Atlantic Ocean. The chief are the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi, the Ohio, the Coza or Cou&s;&s;a, and the river St. John. The Mi&s;&s;i|&s;&s;ippi, which the French call St. Louis, is, in many re&s;pects, the fine&s;t river in the world. It runs a very long cour&s;e, free from &s;hoals and cataracts, and navi|gable within &s;ixty leagues of its &s;ource. The channel is every where deep, and the current gentle, except at a certain &s;ea&s;on, when, like the Nile, it overflows. Its banks are adorned with a delightful variety of meadows and groves, inhabited by a va&s;t number of Indian tribes. What renders the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi more con&s;iderable, is the number of large and navigable rivers that fall into it, both from the ea&s;tward and we&s;tward: of the fir&s;t, Mr. de la Sale, in the relation he pre&s;ented to count Frontenac of his voyage on that river, affirms, there are &s;ix or &s;even, each three hundred leagues in length; of which the mo&s;t con|&s;iderable are, the Oubache or River of St. Jerome, the river Illinois, the Cherokee river, and the Ohio, on which &s;tands Fort Pitt and Pitt&s;burgh, a va&s;t river, which runs along the back of New-York, Maryland, and Virginia: in the Indian language it &s;ignifies a fair river, and is navigable &s;ix hun|dred miles, traver&s;ing the mo&s;t beautiful and fruit|ful countries in the world, and receiving ten or twelve rivers, be&s;ides innumerable brooks: of the rivers that fall into the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi, on the we&s;t &s;ide, the chief is the Mi&s;&s;bure. The Coza or Cou&s;&s;a, which the French call Mobille, is a very large river, which has its &s;ource in the Apalachian mountains, and falls into the Gulph of Mexico one hundred miles &s;outh of the town of Manhela, or Mobille.

Nothing is more delightful than the meadows, which are fit for &s;eed of all kinds. In &s;ome parts, the &s;oil yields three or four crops in the year; for the winter con&s;i&s;ts only in heavy rains, without any nipping fro&s;ts. Almo&s;t all &s;orts of trees which Europe affords are to be found here, be&s;ides a variety of others unknown to us, and &s;ome of them of great value; &s;uch as lofty cedars, which di&s;til a gum that is &s;aid to excel all the noble&s;t European perfumes; and cotton-trees, which are of a prodigious height. The whole country abounds with an infinite variety of game, fowl, cattle, and indeed every thing that life can de&s;ire. The woods and lakes, both here and
<PB N="345" REF="3460">
in Ea&s;t Florida, are full of deer, goats, lions, leo|pards, wolves, hares, rabbits, elks, buffaloes, pan|thers, bears, wild cats, beavers, otters, foxes, ra|coons, &s;quirrels, and martins. The rivers abound with fi&s;h, and al&s;o with &s;nakes and allegators. As for the winged &s;pecies, here are turkies, par|tridges, parrots, pelicans, bu&s;tards, phea&s;ants, pi|geons, turtles, blackbirds, thru&s;hes, herons, &s;torks, cranes, &s;nipes, eagles, hawks, &s;wans, gee&s;e, ducks, and many others, &s;ome of which have their plumage elegantly variegated. The natives, who are di|vided into innumerable tribes, the mo&s;t con&s;idera|ble of whom are, the Cherokees, Creeks, Choctaws, Chicke&s;aws, and Natches, are of an olive complec|tion, their bodies robu&s;t, and finely proportioned: both &s;exes go generally naked, except only a deer|&s;kin round their wai&s;t. They &s;tain their &s;kins with the juice of plants. Their hair is black and long, and they have a method of twi&s;ting it about their heads &s;o as to make it look very graceful. Their weapons are bows and arrows, which they manage with great dexterity: the &s;trings of their bows are made of the &s;inews of &s;tags, and their arrows are pointed with the teeth of fi&s;hes, or &s;harp|ened &s;tones. The women are very hand&s;ome, and well &s;haped, and withal &s;o active, that they will &s;wim acro&s;s broad rivers with their children on their backs, or climb with &s;urprizing agility to the tops of the highe&s;t trees. In religion, they are bi|goted idolaters, wor&s;hipping the &s;un and moon, and bearing an extreme aver&s;ion to all Chri&s;tians; which, indeed, is not to be wondered at, &s;ince the horrid cruelties exerci&s;ed by the Spaniards on the natives of the i&s;land of Cuba, and Mexico, could not fail to excite the utmo&s;t abhorrence and dread of them in tho&s;e &s;avages, in&s;tead of recommending their religion, which could not be called Chri&s;tiani|ty, though it might be genuine popery.</P>

There are but few European &s;ettlements of any con&s;equence, either in Ea&s;t or We&s;t Florida. In the former, the principal place is St. Augu&s;tine, &s;tanding on the ea&s;tern coa&s;t of the penin&s;ula, about &s;eventy leagues from the Gulph of Florida and Channel of Bahama, thirty &s;outh of the river Alatamaha, or Alatumacha, and forty-&s;even from the town and river of Savannah. It is &s;ituated in lat. 30 north, and lies along the &s;hore, at the bot|tom of a hill, in the form of a parallelogram, the &s;treets cutting each other at right angles. The port is formed by an i&s;land and a long point of land, al|mo&s;t divided from the continent by a river, which falls into the &s;ea two miles &s;outh of the town. About a mile to the northward of the town &s;tands the ca&s;tle, defended by four ba&s;tions, and pretty &s;trong. The entrance into the port lies between the i&s;land and the point of land, and is about one mile and a quarter over, but very &s;hallow, as is in|deed mo&s;t part of the coa&s;t of Florida.</P>
<P>The next place to St. Angu&s;tine, at lea&s;t when the Spaniards were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of this country, was St. Matthio, &s;ituated about fifteen leagues to the north of the former, towards Georgia.</P>
<P>Mr. Rolles, a public-&s;pirited gentleman, and member in the Briti&s;h parliament for Barn&s;taple in Devon&s;hire, having had a grant of a tract of land in this country, hath planned a &s;ettlement upon the river St. John, to which he hath already car|ried over a con&s;iderable number of adventurers.</P>

the hands of the Engli&s;h, it will &s;oon become more con&s;iderable. The &s;oil of the neighbouring coun|try is &s;aid to be but indifferent, and the harbour in|convenient, yet there is an ea&s;y entrance from it into the Gulph of Mexico, and con&s;equently an opportu|nity of carrying on a lucrative trade with the Spani|ards. Its &s;ituation is al&s;o advantageous for the peltry trade with the Indians, the river being large, extend|ing far within land, and yielding, as &s;ome &s;ay, pearls, which are found in a &s;ort of &s;hell-fi&s;h, between a mu&s;cle and an oy&s;ter, by the antients called pinna.</P>
<P>Pen&s;acola &s;tands on the we&s;t &s;ide of the bay to which it gives name, about ten leagues ea&s;t of Dauphin I&s;le, at the mouth of the river Mobille. The harbour is the be&s;t upon all this coa&s;t of the gulph, being large, &s;afe from all winds, with four fathom water at the entrance, and &s;even or eight farther in. A fine river enters the bay on the ea&s;t &s;ide of the harbour, which comes about one hundred miles out of the country, after being formed by the junction of two other rivers. The town is not con&s;iderable at pre&s;ent; but it is pro|bable, from the commodiou&s;ne&s;s of its &s;ituation and harbour, it will &s;oon make a better figure.

<P>New-Orleans, which was the only place of any note in Loui&s;iana that was not ceded to the Eng|li&s;h by the late treaty of peace, and which the French have &s;ince yielded up to the Spaniards, is &s;ituated between the ea&s;tern &s;hore of the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ip|pi and the Fi&s;h River, near the lakes Pontchar|train and Maurepas, and about eighteen leagues from the &s;ea. It is a pretty large hand&s;ome town, but &s;ubject to mo&s;t ruinous inundations; be&s;ides, the navigation, according to Charlevoix, between it and the &s;ea, is &s;o very difficult, that none but &s;mall ve&s;&s;els and flat-bottomed boats can get up to it,

<HEAD>NEW-MEXICO, including CALIFORNIA,</HEAD>
<P>New-Mexico, &s;o called becau&s;e of its being di&s;|covered later than Old-Mexico, is bounded on the north by high mountains, beyond which is a coun|try altogether unknown; by Loui&s;iana on the ea&s;t; by New-Spain on the &s;outh; and on the we&s;t by the Gulph of California, and the Rio Colorado; extending, it is &s;aid, above one hundred miles from ea&s;t to we&s;t, and about nine hundred from &s;outh to north; but the twentieth part of the country, within the&s;e limits, is neither cultivated nor inhabited, either by Spaniards or Indians. As it lies in the mid&s;t of the temperate zone, the climate, in general, is very plea&s;ant; the &s;um|mers, though very warm, are neither &s;ultry nor un|whole&s;ome; and the winters, though pretty &s;harp, are far from being in&s;upportable, and, for the mo&s;t part, clear and healthy.</P>
<P>The greate&s;t encomiums are lavi&s;hed on the fer|tility of the &s;oil, the richne&s;s of the mines, and the variety of valuable commodities produced in this country. It is &s;aid to be beautifully diver&s;ified with fields, meadows, ri&s;ing grounds, and rivers; abounding with fruit and timber-tees, turquoi&s;es, emeralds, and other precious &s;tones, mines of gold and &s;ilver, a great variety of wild and tame cattle, fi&s;h, and fowls. Upon the whole, we may &s;afely
<PB N="349" REF="3500">
affirm, that New-Mexico is among the plea&s;ante&s;t, riche&s;t, and mo&s;t plentiful countries in America, or any other part of the world. There are few great or navigable rivers in it: the mo&s;t con&s;ide|rable are, the Rio Solado and Rio del Norte, which, with &s;everal &s;maller &s;treams, fall into the Gulph of Mexico. On the coa&s;t of the gulph are divers bays, ports, and creeks, which might be ea&s;ily converted into excellent harbours, if the Spa|niards were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of any portion of that com|mercial &s;pirit which animates the other maritime nations of Europe.</P>
<P>The Spani&s;h writers tell us, that New-Mexico is inhabited by a great variety of Indian nations or tribes, totally unconnected with each other; but the principal are the Apaches, a brave, warlike, re&s;olute people; fond of liberty, and the inveterate enemies of tyranny and oppre&s;&s;ion. About the clo&s;e of the la&s;t century, thinking them&s;elves ag+grieved by the Spani&s;h government, they made a general in&s;urrection, and did a great deal of mi&s;|chief; but were at la&s;t obliged to &s;ubmit, and have &s;ince been curbed by &s;tronger garri&s;ons. Mo&s;t of the natives are now Chri&s;tians. When the Spaniards fir&s;t entered this country, they found the natives well cloathed, their lands cultivated, their villages neat, and their hou&s;es built with &s;tone. Their flocks al&s;o were numerous, and they lived more comfortably than mo&s;t of the other &s;avages of America. They were &s;o &s;kilful in &s;hooting, that with an arrow they could &s;trike all the grain out of an ear of corn, without breaking it, at a con&s;iderable di&s;tance. As to religion, they were idolaters, and wor&s;hipped the &s;un and moon; but whether they offered human &s;acrifices, we are not &s;ufficiently informed.</P>

<P>California, the mo&s;t northern of all the Spani&s;h dominions on the continent of America, towards the Pacific Ocean, was for a long time &s;uppo&s;ed to be an i&s;land; but, at la&s;t, was found to be only a penin&s;ula, i&s;&s;uing from the north coa&s;ts of Ame|rica, and extending into the Pacific Ocean eight hundred miles, from Cape Seba&s;tian, in 43&deg;. 30&prime;. north latitude, towards the &s;outh-ea&s;t, as far as Cape St. Lucar, in 22&deg;. 32&prime;. north latitude. The ea&s;tern coa&s;t lies nearly parallel with that of Mexi|co, oppo&s;ite to it; and the &s;ea between is called the Gulph or Lake of California, or the Vermilion Purple, or Red Sea.</P>
<P>The breadth of the penin&s;ula is very unequal; towards the north it is near two hundred miles broad, but at the &s;outh extremity it tapers away, and is &s;carcely fifty miles over.</P>
<P>California was fir&s;t di&s;covered to be a penin&s;ula by Father Caino, or Kino, a German Je&s;uit, who landed in it from the i&s;land of Sumatra, and pa&s;&s;ed into New-Mexico, without cro&s;&s;ing any other wa|ter than Rio Azul, or the Blue River, about north latitude 35&deg;. The more &s;outhern part was known to the Spaniards &s;oon after the di&s;covery of Mexi|co, for Cortes di&s;covered it in 1535; but they did not till lately penetrate far into it, contenting them|&s;elves with the pearl-fi&s;hery on the coa&s;t.

Sir Francis Drake landed there in 1578, and took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of California, for his mi&s;tre&s;s queen Eli|zabeth, by the name of New-Albion; the king of the country actually inve&s;ting him with its &s;ove|reignty, and pre&s;enting him with his crown of beautiful feathers; the people too, thinking the Engli&s;h more than men, began to &s;acrifice to them, but were re&s;trained. Though the Engli&s;h have never attempted to &s;ettle any colonies here, yet they &s;eem to have a better right than the Spani|ards, if ever they &s;hould think fit to lay claim to it.</P>
<P>Though it lies, for the mo&s;t part, in the tempe|rate zone, there are great heats in the &s;ummer on the coa&s;t, but the inland parts are very temperate; and though the winters are pretty &s;evere, they are very healthy. The &s;oil is various: to the we&s;tward of the river Collorado it is level and fruitful, inter|&s;per&s;ed with delightful woods, cool refre&s;hing &s;prings and rivulets, and the mo&s;t enchanting pa&s;|tures and meadows; but, in other places, the coun|try is mo&s;tly wild, rugged, and barren, over-run with rocks, &s;ands, and mountains, and without a &s;uffi|cient quantity of water to make them yield either corn or pa&s;ture: &s;ome of the mountains, however, yield a great variety, both of fruit and fore&s;t-trees, particularly a kind of tree, that bears a fruit called mi&s;cales, which is gathered all the year round; with fine pi&s;tachios, figs of different colours, and a tree called by the natives palo &s;anto, which bears not only a plea&s;ant fruit, but an excellent perfume. There is a &s;hrub-tree named pitahaya, which bears no leaves, but a very delicious fruit, being rich and well tempered, with a grateful acid. It re|&s;embles a hor&s;e-che&s;nut externally; but the pulp comes nearer a fig than any other fruit: in &s;ome it is white, in others yellow, and &s;ometimes red. Here al&s;o are pompions and water-melons, of a pro|digious
<PB N="352" REF="3530">
&s;ize, a plea&s;ant &s;ort of fruit called xicanes, grapes, with a great variety of other fruits, and no le&s;s than fourteen &s;orts of grain. The &s;oil, in many places, is &s;o rich, that the plants bear fruit three times a-year.</P>
<P>As to quadrupeds, here are deer, of which two kinds are peculiar to the country; a par|ticular &s;pecies of &s;heep, buffaloes, beavers or animals much re&s;embling them, a peculiar &s;pe|cies of wild dogs, lions, wild cats, and many other wild bea&s;ts. The hor&s;es, mules, a&s;&s;es, oxen, &s;heep, hogs, goats, and other quadru|peds, that have been imported hither from Spain and Mexico, multiply exceedingly. Of the two &s;pecies of deer peculiar to California, that called taye by the natives is greatly e&s;teemed, and eat with the &s;ame reli&s;h as veni&s;on by our epicures. Of the feathered kind here is a great variety; in particular, Vanegas tells us, that the coa&s;t is plentifully &s;tocked with peacocks, bu&s;tards, gee&s;e, cranes, vultures, gulls, larger than gee&s;e, cormo|rants, mews, quails, linnets, larks, nightingales, and many other &s;pecies.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to fi&s;h, the multitude and variety with which the Gulph of California, the Pacific O|cean, and the rivers are &s;upplied, is almo&s;t incredible. Salmon, turbot, barbel, &s;kate, mackarel, pilchards, thornbacks, &s;oals, bonettas, and many other &s;pecies, are caught here, with very little trouble; together with pearl-oy&s;ters, common delicious oy&s;ters, cray|fi&s;h, lob&s;ters, and a variety of exqui&s;ite &s;hell-fi&s;h. However, of the te&s;taceous kind, the mo&s;t remark|able and abundant is the tortoi&s;e, caught in the ut|mo&s;t plenty upon the coa&s;ts. On the South-Sea coa&s;t al&s;o is a &s;hell-fi&s;h, the mo&s;t beautiful that can be imagined, being of an elegant vivid blue colour, like the lapis lazuli.</P>
<P>California affords one of the riche&s;t pearl-fi&s;heries in the world, and is likewi&s;e thought to have mines.</P>

As to in&s;ects, they &s;warm here, as in mo&s;t warm countries; yet they are neither &s;o numerous or trouble&s;ome as in &s;ome, on account of the dry|ne&s;s of the &s;oil and climate.</P>
<P>There are two con&s;iderable rivers in California, viz. Rio Collorado, and Rio du Carmel, with &s;e|veral &s;maller &s;treams, and fine ports, bays, creeks, and roads, both on the ea&s;t and we&s;t &s;ide, which is the rea&s;on of its having been formerly &s;o much frequented by our privateers in the South-Seas.</P>
<P>We had almo&s;t forgot to mention a &s;pecies of manna found here, being a juice which ex&s;udates from a tree, and which is as &s;weet as &s;ugar, tho' not &s;o white, and plea&s;ant to the eye.</P>
<P>In the heart of the country there are plains of &s;alt, quite firm, and clear as cry&s;tal, which, con&s;i|dering the va&s;t quantities of fi&s;h of all &s;orts found here, might be of great advantage to any civilized nation that &s;hould po&s;&s;e&s;s them&s;elves of the coun|try.</P>
<P>There is a great variety of &s;avage tribes in Ca|lifornia. Tho&s;e that live on the ea&s;t &s;ide of the penin&s;ula are &s;aid to be great enemies to the Spa|niards; but, in the other parts, they &s;eem to be ve|ry ho&s;pitable to all &s;trangers. The inland coun|try, e&s;pecially towards the north, is populous. The Indians, in mo&s;t re&s;pects, re&s;emble tho&s;e we have already taken notice of in other parts of A|merica. They have a great many ab&s;urd, ridicu|lous cu&s;toms, opinions, and &s;uper&s;titions. They go almo&s;t naked, and pay great deference to their prie&s;ts, who al&s;o pretend to be magicians and phy|&s;icians.

policy, and refinement, all the other nations of America differ only in the modes of barbarity; being nearly &s;imilar in capacity and di&s;po&s;ition. Even among the&s;e &s;avages, a love of ornament prevails more among the women than the men; this is a female weakne&s;s that &s;eems common to all countries. Here the women are &s;et off with pearls, and all the other &s;plendid trinkets, which nature affords, or their ingenuity can invent. Father To|raval tells us, that the Californians di&s;play great ingenuity in their nets: "I can affirm, (&s;ays he) that of all the nets I ever &s;aw in Europe and New-Spain, none are comparable to them, either in whitene&s;s, the mixture of colours, or the &s;trength and workman&s;hip, in which they repre&s;ent a va&s;t variety of figures."</P>
<P>It is but lately that the Spaniards had any &s;ettle|ment on this penin&s;ula; and what they have is on|ly a village, near Cape St. Lucar, at the &s;outh end of it, which they call California. The Manilla &s;hips touch here &s;ometimes, in their cour&s;e to Acapulco; and the place is likely to become con&s;i|derable in time, in con&s;equence of the pearl-trade carried on with the natives.</P>
<P>There are many &s;mall i&s;lands on the coa&s;t of this penin&s;ula, both in the South-Sea and the Gulph; and it is ob&s;erved, that Capt. Dampier propo&s;ed &s;eeking a north-we&s;t pa&s;&s;age, by doubling Cape Blanco, at the northern extremity of California.</P>

Along the Pacific Ocean it &s;tretches above two thou&s;and miles, and the coa&s;t towards the North Sea cannot extend le&s;s than one thou&s;and &s;ix hundred miles; but the breadth is very unequal. Towards the north-we&s;t it is &s;aid to be between &s;ix and &s;even hundred miles over, while, towards the &s;outh-ea&s;t, the breadth does not exceed &s;ixty miles. It is governed by a viceroy, and divided into the three audiences of Guadalajara, Mexico, and Guatimala; the fir&s;t of which contains the provinces of Cinaloa, Culiacan, Chiamettan, Xa|li&s;co, Guadalajara Proper, Xacatecas, and New-Bi&s;|cay; the &s;econd, tho&s;e of Mechoacan, Mexico Proper, Panuco, Tla&s;cala, Guaxaca, Taba&s;co, and Yucatan; and the third, tho&s;e of Chiapa, Soconu&s;|ca, Guatimala Proper, Varapaz, Honduras, Ni|caragua, Co&s;ta-Rica, and Veragua.</P>
<P>Though the greater part of Mexico lies within the torrid zone, yet the air is temperate and healthy. As you approach the equinoctial, it nece&s;&s;arily grows hotter; but in no place is the atmo&s;phere heated to &s;uch a degree as to render the climate in|&s;upportable. This ari&s;es from the land and &s;ea breezes, which blow alternately; and the great number of lakes and rivers, the vapours from which cool the air, and render it mild, &s;oft, and plea&s;ant. The greate&s;t heats are during the months of February, March, and April, when the &s;un is &s;eldom ob&s;cured by clouds, and the waters are dried up in &s;uch a manner, that it is difficult to meet with any in many places. The rainy &s;ea&s;on begins towards the clo&s;e of April, and continues un|til the month of September; being always pre|ceded by tempe&s;ts or tornadoes, thunder, light|ning, and hurricanes, when the wind blows almo&s;t

from every point of the heavens, increa&s;ing daily in fury till the month of June, at which time the rain falls as if a &s;econd deluge were to en&s;ue. No country under heaven abounds more with grain, delicious fruits, roots, and vegetables; many of which are peculiar to it, or at lea&s;t to America. Of the&s;e the mo&s;t remarkable are, bamboes, man|groves, and logwood, which grow on the coa&s;ts; red and white cotton-trees, cedars, blood-wood, and maho, of which the natives make ropes and cables; light-wood, of which they make floats, being as light as cork; white-wood, the cabbage|tree, the calaba&s;h, cacao, and venella, which the Spaniards call bexuco or bainilla; plantains, ba|nanas, pine-apples, &s;apadillo, avogato pear, mam|mee, mammee-&s;apota, grape, prickle, bibby, and other curious fruit-trees; be&s;ides which, the Spa|niards have introduced mo&s;t of the European fruits. Mexico al&s;o produces the poi&s;onous man|chineel apple, gourds of a prodigious &s;ize, melons, &s;ilk-gra&s;s, tamarinds, and locu&s;t-trees; the little, black, white, and borachio &s;apotoe trees, the la&s;t of which takes its name from the inebriating quality of the fruit. To the&s;e we may add the grenadillo de China, creeping-plant, and the may-hey, which furni&s;hes the natives with thread for linen and cord|age, and al&s;o a bal&s;am and liquor, which, when fer|mented, is as plea&s;ant and &s;trong as wine: from this too is di&s;tilled a &s;trong &s;pirit, not unlike brandy.</P>
<P>Other valuable productions of New-Spain are, co|pal, aninie, tacamahaca, caranica, liquid amber, and oil of amber. Bal&s;am of Peru is al&s;o found in Mexi|co, guiacum, china-root, &s;ar&s;aparilla, and the root mechoacan, which are well known to druggi&s;ts and apothecaries, and of excellent u&s;e in a variety of di&s;tempers. Be&s;ides the maiz or native grain of Mexico, the Spaniards have introduced the u&s;e of barley, wheat, pea&s;e, beans, and other grain;
<PB N="357" REF="3580">
pul&s;e, roots, and vegetables, which are now com|mon in every province. Rice grows abundantly, and flouri&s;hes extremely, on account of the long wet &s;ea&s;ons. Trees are all the year in leaf, blo&s;|&s;om, or fruit; and every month in the year pre&s;ents an appearance of &s;pring, &s;ummer, and autumn, al|together.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t remarkable animals of New-Spain are, the pecarree, a little black &s;hort-legged animal, that has &s;ome re&s;emblance of a hog, but his navel grows on his back; the waree, like the former, but &s;ome|thing le&s;s; the opo&s;&s;um; the moo&s;e-deer; the guanoe, of the &s;hape of a lizard, but as big as a man's leg; the flying-&s;quirrel, which has a &s;mall body, and a loo&s;e &s;kin, which he extends like wings, and is born up by the wind a con&s;iderable time; the &s;loth, which is about the bigne&s;s of a &s;paniel, and feeds on the leaves of trees, but is &s;o long of get|ting down one tree and up another, that he grows lean on the journey; the armadillo, &s;o named from his &s;hell, re&s;embling armour, in which he can in|clo&s;e him&s;elf; the racoon, pretty much re&s;embling a badger; the ounce, or tyger-cat; beavers; the manatee, a kind of fi&s;h, as big as an ox, and excel|lent eating; five or &s;ix &s;pecies of tortoi&s;es; the gar-fi&s;h, which has a &s;harp bone at the end of his &s;nout like a &s;pear; and the paracood, a fi&s;h about an ell long, and well ta&s;ted, but unwhole&s;ome at &s;ome &s;ea&s;ons.</P>
<P>Of the feathered kind, the mo&s;t remarkable are, the macaw, the quam, the cura&s;oe, the cardinal, and the humming-bird.</P>
<P>Among many other reptiles and in&s;ects are, the rattle-&s;nake, the migua, and the cochineal-fly. The mi-gua is an in&s;ect &s;o &s;mall that it cannot ea&s;ily be di&s;cerned, and u&s;ually &s;trikes into a man's legs. If it is let alone, it will get deep into the fle&s;h, where it lays a great many nits or eggs, which increa&s;e to

the bigne&s;s of a pea; and, if the part is &s;cratched, it immediately fe&s;ters, and endangers the lo&s;s of a limb. The cochineal fly is bred in a fruit, that grows on a &s;hrub about five feet high: when the fruit opens, the&s;e in&s;ects take wing, and hover a little while over the tree, and then fall down dead on the &s;heets that are &s;pread for them.</P>
<P>There are &s;ome high mountains on the we&s;tern coa&s;t of New-Spain, near the Pacific Ocean, mo&s;t of which are &s;aid to be vulcanos. Several rivers ri&s;e in the&s;e mountains, and fall &s;ome into the Gulph of Mexico, and &s;ome into the South-Sea, on both of which there are &s;everal capes and bays. Among the bays on the gulph, are tho&s;e of Cam|peachy and Honduras.</P>
<P>The principal commodities of New-Spain are, wool, cotton, &s;ugar, &s;ilk, cochineal, chocolate, fea|thers, honey, bal&s;ams, drugs, dying woods, &s;alt, tallow, hides, tobacco, ginger, amber, pearls, pre|cious &s;tones, ja&s;per, porphyry, exqui&s;ite marble, and gold and &s;ilver.</P>
<P>The gold and &s;ilver mines are found in the rocky barren parts of the country. There are &s;everal, it is &s;aid, of the former; and no fewer than a thou|&s;and of the latter. Gold is al&s;o found in grains, or du&s;t, in the &s;ands of rivers and torrents. Who|ever di&s;covers a mine of gold or &s;ilver, is at liberty to work it, paying the king a tenth of the pro|duct, and limiting him&s;elf within fifty yards round the place upon which he has fixed. All the &s;ilver and gold, dug or found in grains, is entered in the royal exchequer; and it is reported, that, not|with&s;tanding great quantities are run and conceal|ed, no le&s;s than two millions of &s;ilver marks, weigh|ing eight ounces each, are entered yearly, out of which they coin &s;even hundred thou&s;and marks, into pieces of eight, half pieces of eight, quarter|pieces, rials, and half-pieces; the value of the lat|ter being about three-pence &s;terling.</P>

The people of Mexico, and the re&s;t of the Spani&s;h We&s;t-Indies, are prohibited trading with any but the &s;ubjects of Spain; nor are foreigners &s;uffered to vi&s;it their coa&s;ts. The traffic of Mexi|co is one of the riche&s;t and mo&s;t exten&s;ive in the world; for they trade with the Philippine I&s;lands, near the coa&s;t of China, through the South-Sea or Pacific Ocean; with Peru and Chili, through the &s;ame &s;ea; and with Old-Spain, and the Spani&s;h i&s;lands and &s;ettlements on that &s;ide, through the North-Sea and Atlantic Ocean; all which trades are held lawful. There is al&s;o a very con&s;iderable &s;muggling, or clande&s;tine trade, carried on by the Spaniards and Indians in America, with the Eng|li&s;h, French, and Dutch.</P>
<P>The whole of the trade between Old-Spain and the Spani&s;h dominions in America, is carried, on by annual &s;hips, u&s;ually divided into three cla&s;&s;es, the flota, the regi&s;ter &s;hips, and galleons.</P>
<P>The flota is a fleet of three men of war, and fourteen or fifteen merchant-&s;hips, from four hun|dred to one thou&s;and tons burthen: they are loaded almo&s;t with every &s;ort of goods which Europe produces for exportation; all &s;orts of wool|lens, linens, &s;ilks, velvets, laces, gla&s;s, paper, and cutlery; all &s;orts of wrought iron, watches, clocks, quick&s;ilver for the u&s;e of their mines, hor&s;e|furniture, &s;hoes, &s;tockings, books, pictures, milita|ry &s;tores, wines, fruits, &amp;c. &s;o that all the trading part of Europe are highly intere&s;ted in the cargo of this fleet. Spain it&s;elf &s;ends out little more than the wine and fruit; this, with the freight and commi&s;&s;ions to the merchant, and the duty to the king, is almo&s;t all the advantage which that king|dom derives from her commerce with the Indies. This fleet is fitted out at Cadiz, and de&s;tined for La Vera Cruz, &s;ituated on the gulph in the king|dom of Mexico: they are not permitted to break
<PB N="360" REF="3610">
bulk, on any account, till they arrive there. When all the goods are landed and di&s;po&s;ed of at La Ve|ra Cruz, the fleet takes in the plate, precious &s;tones, cochineal, indigo, cocoa, tobacco, &s;ugar, and hides, which are the returns for Old-Spain. From La Vera Cruz they &s;ail to the Havannah, which is the place of their rendezvous, where they meet the gal|leons. The&s;e are another fleet, which carry on all the trade of Terra-Firma, by Carthagena; and of Peru, by Panama and Porto-Bello; in the &s;ame manner as the flota &s;erves for New-Spain. When the flota arrives at the Havannah, and joins the galleons and regi&s;ter-&s;hips, which a&s;&s;emble at the &s;ame port from all quarters, &s;ome of the clean|e&s;t and be&s;t &s;ailing ve&s;&s;els are di&s;patched to Old-Spain, with advice of the contents of the&s;e &s;everal fleets, as well as with trea&s;ure and goods of their own, that the court may judge what indulto or duty is proper to be laid on them, and what convoy is nece&s;&s;ary for their &s;afety.</P>
<P>Regi&s;ter-&s;hips are &s;ent out by merchants at Cadiz and Seville, when they judge that goods mu&s;t be wanted at any particular ports in the We&s;t-Indies. Their way is, to petition the council of the Indies for a licence to &s;end a &s;hip of three hundred tons burthen, or under, to that port: they pay for this licence forty or fifty thou&s;and dollars, be&s;ides pre|&s;ents to the officers, in proportion to the con|nivance nece&s;&s;ary to the de&s;ign; for though the licence runs only to three hundred tons at mo&s;t, the ve&s;&s;el fitted out is &s;eldom le&s;s than &s;ix hundred. This &s;hip and cargo are regi&s;tered at the pretended burthen: it is required too, that a certificate be brought from the king's officer at the port to which &s;he is bound, that &s;he does not exceed the &s;ize at which &s;he is regi&s;tered; all this pa&s;&s;es of cour&s;e. The&s;e are what they call regi&s;ter-&s;hips, and by the&s;e the trade of Spani&s;h-America has been carried
<PB N="361" REF="3620">
on principally for &s;ome years pa&s;t; which practice has been thought as much to the prejudice of their trade, as it is contrary to all their former maxims for carrying it on.</P>
<P>The fleet which is called the galleons con&s;i&s;ts of|eight men of war, of five hundred tons each, de|&s;igned principally to &s;upply Peru with military &s;tores; but, in reality, laden not only with tho&s;e, but with every other kind of merchandize, on a private account, &s;o as to be in too weak a condi|tion either to defend them&s;elves, or to protect others. Under the convoy of the&s;e are twelve &s;ail of merchant-&s;hips, not inferior to the galleons in burthen. This fleet of the galleons is regulated in much the &s;ame manner as the flota; and is de&s;tined for the exclu&s;ive commerce of Terra firma, and the South-Sea, as the flota is for that of Mexico.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as this galleon fleet arrives at Car|thagena, expre&s;&s;es are di&s;patched to Porto-Bello, and to all the adjacent towns, but particularly to Panama, that they may get ready all the trea&s;ure, which is depo&s;ited there, to meet the galleons at Porto-Bello; at which place all that are con|cerned in the various branches of this exten&s;ive trade a&s;&s;emble. There is no part of the world, where bu&s;ine&s;s of &s;uch great importance, is ne|gociated in &s;o &s;hort a time; for &s;ometimes in a fortnight the fair is over. During the fair, heaps of wedges and ingots of &s;ilver are thrown about upon the wharfs, as things of no value. The di&s;play of gold, &s;ilver, and precious &s;tones, on one hand, and of the curious workman&s;hip of the va|rious ingenious fabrics of Europe on the other, is truly a&s;toni&s;hing.</P>
<P>The whole trade between the Ea&s;t-Indies and Spani&s;h America, is carried on by one great gal|leon, which arrives at Acapulio on the South Sea, from the Phillipine I&s;lands, in the month of De|cember.

They &s;ee no other land in the whole voyage of three thou&s;and leagues, which they per|form in five months, than the little Ladrones. The &s;hip is laden with all the rich commodities of the Ea&s;t, as cloves, pepper, cinnamon, nutmegs, mace, tea, china, Japan wares, callicoes, plain and painted mu&s;lins of every &s;ort, &s;ilks, precious &s;tones, rich drugs, Per&s;ian carpets, benjamin, camphire, ivory, and gold du&s;t; all which amounts to a pro|digious value, this one &s;hip having more riches in it than &s;ome whole fleets. At the &s;ame time the rich &s;hip from Lima comes in, which is computed to bring no le&s;s than two millions of pieces of eight in &s;ilver, or four hundred and fifty thou&s;and pound &s;terling. Several other &s;hips from the different ports of Chili and Peru, meet upon the &s;ame oc|ca&s;ion; and be&s;ides the traffic for the Philippine commodities, there is very large dealing for every thing, which the&s;e countries have to exchange with one another, as well as for all &s;orts of European goods. The fair at Acapulco la&s;ts &s;ometimes for thirty days. As &s;oon as the goods are di&s;po&s;ed of, the galleon prepares to &s;et out on her voyage to the Philippines, with her returns, chiefly in &s;ilver; but with &s;ome European goods, and other commo|dities of America. We &s;peak here as though there were but one ve&s;&s;el in the trade with the Phi|lippines, and in fact there is only nominally one trading ve&s;&s;el, the galleon it&s;elf, of about two thou&s;and tons; but another attends her commonly, as a &s;ort of convoy, which generally carries &s;uch a quantity of goods as, in a great mea&s;ure, di&s;ables her from executing that office. The galleon has often one thou&s;and people on board, either intere&s;t|ed in the cargo, or merely as pa&s;&s;engers; and there is no trade in which &s;o large profits are made, the captain of the ve&s;&s;el, the pilot, the mate, and even the common &s;ailors, making in one voyage what,
<PB N="363" REF="3640">
in their &s;everal ranks, may be con&s;idered as ea&s;y fortunes. The Je&s;uits, before their &s;uppre&s;&s;ion, are &s;aid to have had the profits of this &s;hip to &s;up|port their mi&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>New-Spain produces a va&s;t quantity of &s;ugar, e&s;pecially towards the Gulph of Mexico, and about Guaxaca and Guatimala; &s;o that here are more &s;ugar mills than in any other part of Spani&s;h A|merica; but the &s;ugar is chiefly con&s;umed in the city of Mexico and the mona&s;teries, in chocolate, &s;weetmeats, pre&s;erves, and confectionary wares; a great deal al&s;o is &s;ent from Guaxaca, Guatimala, and other provinces, to Mexico and Panama, and from thence is conveyed by &s;ea to Lima, Guaiaquil, and Baldivia. There is a great trade al&s;o in goods manufactured of cotton, and in indigo and cochineal. It is &s;aid, the people of Nicaragua and Honduras employ three hundred thou&s;and mules and hor&s;es, to carry corn, &s;ugar, cocoa, &amp;c. into the inland provinces, and particularly to the city of Mexico. When the galleons come to Vera Cruz, the number of carriages, men and hor&s;es, mules and a&s;&s;es, employed to carry the trea&s;ure of the country, with the tobacco, &s;ugar, and other pro|ductions of Guatimala and Guaxaca, to Vera Cruz, is incredible. The carriage al&s;o of the European goods, that come by the galleons, back again to the different parts of the kingdom, is a con&s;idera|ble article of trade; the &s;ilver alone brought from Zacatacas is &s;aid to employ &s;ix thou&s;and mules.</P>
<P>By an article of the la&s;t treaty of peace, the king of Spain gives up all claim or right to mo|le&s;t the Engli&s;h in cutting logwood in the bays of Campeachy and Honduras.</P>
<P>New-Spain is at pre&s;ent inhabited by a mixed people; con&s;i&s;ting of the native Indians; the Spa|niards, and other Europeans; the unmixed de|&s;cendants of the Spaniards, who are called Creoli;
<PB N="364" REF="3650">
the Me&s;tizos, or i&s;&s;ue of the Spaniards by Ame|ricans; the Me&s;tiches, or the i&s;&s;ue of &s;uch i&s;&s;ue; the Terceroons des Indies, or the children of the la&s;t, married to Spaniards; and the Quarteroons dez Indies, who&s;e de&s;cendants are allowed the &s;ame privileges as true Spaniards. The negroes are likewi&s;e pretty numerous, being imported from the coa&s;t of Africa for various purpo&s;es, and many of them admitted to their freedom. The i&s;&s;ue of an European and a negro con&s;titutes another di&s;tinc|tion, called Mulatto; be&s;ides which, there is a mixed breed of negroes and Indians, which is generally deemed the lowe&s;t rank of the people.</P>
<P>There are &s;ome tribes of Indians, both in the open country and the mountains, that &s;till pre&s;erve their freedom; but mo&s;t of them are &s;ubject to the Spaniards, and have embraced the popi&s;h re|ligion. Among the free Indians are tho&s;e on the Mo&s;quito &s;hore, where the Engli&s;h have a go|vernor, and &s;ome &s;ettlements; the&s;e Indians being implacable enemies to the Spaniards, but firm friends and allies to the Engli&s;h. Great numbers of Indians are employed by the Spaniards in work|ing their gold and &s;ilver mines.</P>
<P>The&s;e natives in general are tall, clean, well pro|portioned, and hand&s;ome: their complexion is a deep olive, and both &s;exes have long, black, lank, coar&s;e hair on their heads; but they &s;uffer none on the other parts of their bodies. Some tribes look upon flat no&s;es as a great beauty. Almo&s;t all the Mexicans paint their bodies with the figures of va|rious birds and bea&s;ts, and anoint them with oil or fat. Some tribes are cloathed; but the men of others go almo&s;t quite naked. The Mexicans, in general, have their no&s;es, lips, ears, necks, and arms, adorned with pearls and other jewels, or trinkets, made of gold, &s;ilver, or &s;ome other metal. The free Indians are &s;aid to be a brave, generous,
<PB N="365" REF="3660">
humane people, except in the article of human &s;a|crifices; but the others are become cruel, treache|rous, cowardly, mean, thievi&s;h, and altogether vi|cious. Though the free Indians di&s;cover a great veneration for the &s;un and moon, they have no image of them, but a great many of human form. They cultivate but little &s;oil, and live chiefly by hunting and fi&s;hing. Be&s;ides all the dome&s;tic of|fices, the women &s;pin, weave, and dre&s;s cotton and linen cloths, for their own and their hu&s;bands apparel.</P>
<P>As to the Spaniards of Mexico, Gage tells us, that he was amazed to find the clergy, both &s;ecular and regular, rivaling the quality in their dre&s;s and luxurious way of life; they drank, they gamed, they &s;wore, they wenched, and made a je&s;t of their vows of poverty, getting money enough, many of them, to return to Old-Spain, and purcha&s;e bi&s;hop|rics. It is frequent, he &s;ays, for a prie&s;t, who has but an ordinary cure in Mexico, to lay up ten or twelve thou&s;and crowns in ten years; and to live plentifully all the time, and be in a manner adored by the common people.</P>
<P>As to the laity, he &s;ays, there is not a more bi|gotted, or a lewder people on the face of the earth: a pre&s;ent to the church wipes off the odium of the greate&s;t crimes; and the way the people are in|&s;tructed in their religion here, as in Old-Spain, is by plays and theatrical entertainments in their churches.</P>
<P>Few are &s;o unacquainted with hi&s;tory, as not to know that America, or the New-World, was fir&s;t di&s;covered by Columbus, a native of Genoa, to|wards the fifteenth century. Among the other di&s;coverers and conquerors, after Columbus, was Hernando Cortez, who embarked for the i&s;land of Hi&s;paniola, anno 1504, and from thence went to Cuba, and had a great &s;hare in the reduction of that i&s;land: whereupon Diego Vela&s;quez, the go|vernor,
<PB N="366" REF="3670">
made choice of him to command the forces intended to invade the empire of Mexico. Cor|tez &s;ailed from St. Jago de Cuba, on the 18th of November 1518, and touching at the Havannah, he &s;ailed again from thence the 10th of February, and arrived at the i&s;land of Cozumel, near the coa&s;t of Jucatan, a few days after, where he mu&s;tered his forces, con&s;i&s;ting of five hundred and eight foot, &s;ixteen hor&s;e, and one hundred and nine &s;eamen, be&s;ides his two chaplains.</P>
<P>He &s;ailed from Cozumel the 4th of March 1518, and having doubled Cape Catoch, he continued his voyage to the mouth of the river Taba&s;co, in the Bay of Campeachy, where he landed, defeated the Indians, and took the town of Taba&s;co, after which he embarked his forces, and &s;ailed to St. John de Ulva, where landing his forces, he receiv|ed an emba&s;&s;y from Motezuma, the emperor.</P>
<P>Cortez &s;oon after burnt his &s;hips, and began his march for the capital city of Mexico, and coming to Tla&s;cala, the 23d of September 1519, he was joined by that people, who were at war with the Mexicans. While Cortez remained here, he re|ceived another emba&s;&s;y from Montezuma, inviting him to his capital; but Cortez, pretending this was a treacherous de&s;ign, fell upon the &s;ubjects of Montezuma, and cut &s;everal thou&s;ands of them in pieces; at which the emperor was &s;o terrified, that he offered to re&s;ign him&s;elf to the general's plea|&s;ure, and accordingly opened the gates of his capi|tal to Cortez, who arrived there the 19th of No|vember 1519.</P>
<P>Not long after, Cortez &s;eized the per&s;on of the emperor, and made him his pri&s;oner, and his offi|cers proceeded to plunder the city; whereupon there happened a general in&s;urrection of the na|tives, who drove the Spaniards out of the city; and Montezuma, it is pre&s;umed, was murdered by
<PB N="367" REF="3680">
the Spaniards, when they found they could not carry him off alive; for he was never heard of af|terwards.</P>
<P>Cortez, having received a reinforcement of Spa|niards from Europe, returned towards Mexico a|gain, and inve&s;ted that city by land, as well as wa|ter, making him&s;elf ma&s;ter of it the 13th of Au|gu&s;t 1521; in which &s;iege, it is &s;aid, one hundred thou&s;and Mexicans were de&s;troyed.</P>
<P>The re&s;t of the provinces of this empire &s;ubmit|ted to Cortez, &s;oon after the &s;urrender of the capi|tal: they were u&s;ed, however, with that barbarity, that Cortez was &s;ent for over to Spain, to give an account of his conduct; but he carried trea&s;ure enough with him to purcha&s;e his peace, and get his commi&s;&s;ion of generali&s;&s;imo confirmed. At his return he &s;ent &s;ome &s;hips to the Spice I&s;lands, in the Ea&s;t-Indies, but the Portugue&s;e drove them from thence; he al&s;o attempted to make further di&s;coveries in the South-Seas, but was un&s;ucce&s;sful in both attempts: whereupon he went over to Spain again, whither &s;o many complaints of his oppre&s;&s;ion and cruelty followed him, that he was not &s;uffered to return to Mexico again; but re|mained a kind of a pri&s;oner at large in the court of Spain till his death, which happened on the 2d of December 1545, in the &s;ixty-&s;econd year of his age. His body was &s;ent over to Mexico, and in|terred in the cathedral of that city.</P>
<P>The principal cities in New-Spain are, Mexico, the capital; Granada, in the province of Nicaragua; Puebla de los Angelos, and Vera Cruz, in the pro|vince of Tla&s;cala; Guadalajara, Honduras, and Guatimala, in the provinces &s;o called; Campeachy, in the province of Jucatan or Yucatan; and Aca|pulco, in that of Mexico Proper.</P>

and &s;eventy miles we&s;t of the Gulph of Mex|ico. In point of regularity, it exceeds all the cities in the univer&s;e; the &s;treets being &s;o &s;treight, and exactly di&s;po&s;ed, that from any part of the town the whole is vi&s;ible. The want of gates, walls, and artillery, together with the five great cau&s;eways leading to the city, renders Mexico extremely re|markable. All the buildings are convenient; but the public edifices, e&s;pecially the churches and con|vents, are magnificent. The income of the grand cathedral amounts to near eighty thou&s;and pounds &s;terling per annum, out of which the archbi&s;hop has fifteen thou&s;and pounds, be&s;ides va&s;t &s;ums ari&s;|ing from perqui&s;ites. The number of the inhabi|tants is computed at three hundred thou&s;and, who are &s;aid to draw annually from the mines above ten millions of money, without reckoning the va&s;t &s;ums &s;ecreted, in order to defraud the king of his rights; yet, with the&s;e almo&s;t incredible trea&s;ures, the people may be reckoned poor, as mo&s;t of them live beyond their fortunes, and terminate a life of profu&s;ion in the mo&s;t wretched indigence. What mo&s;t &s;trikes the eye of a traveller here is, the va&s;t quantity of jewels, gold and &s;ilver plate, and toys, expo&s;ed to &s;ale in the &s;treets, together with the mo&s;t valuable commodities of Europe and A&s;ia.</P>
<P>Acapulco &s;tands in 17&deg;. north latitude, on a bay of the South-Sea, about two hundred and ten miles &s;outh-ea&s;t from Mexico. The haven is large and commodious, and the entrance &s;e|cured by a flat i&s;land running acro&s;s, at each end of which is a deep channel, &s;ufficiently broad for the greate&s;t ve&s;&s;els. The only inconvenience is, that &s;hips mu&s;t enter by the &s;ea-wind, and go out by the land-breeze, which &s;eldom fail to &s;ucceed each other alternately; &s;o that they are frequently blown off to &s;ea, after repeated attempts to make the harbour.

During the fair, after the arrival of the annual Lima and Manilla &s;hips, the town is &s;o crouded with &s;trangers, that great num|bers are obliged to pitch tents in the neighbour|hood for their accommodation. It is &s;uppo&s;ed, that the Manilla galleon carries off from Acapulco at lea&s;t ten millions of dollars, in return for the goods &s;he brought thither, and for the payment of the Spani&s;h garri&s;ons in the Philippine I&s;les.</P>
<P>Vera Cruz, or Ulva, &s;tands on the Gulph of Mexico, about &s;eventy leagues from the capital. It is very &s;trong, both by nature and art, being the great mart of all the Spani&s;h trade in the North-Sea; and has a &s;afe, commodious, though not ca|pacious harbour. The air is &s;o unhealthy, that no Spaniards of di&s;tinction make their con&s;tant re&s;idence in it. A prodigious trade is carried on here, not on|ly with Mexico, but by Mexico with the Ea&s;t-In|dies; and al&s;o with Old-Spain, Cuba, Jucatan, Pe|ru, and all the interior part of the Spani&s;h domi|nions. After the arrival of the flota and galleons from Old-Spain there is a great fair, which conti|nues almo&s;t till their departure. The warehou&s;es are con&s;tantly full of the commodities and manu|factures of Europe, A&s;ia, and America.</P>

<P>THIS va&s;t penin&s;ula, extending it&s;elf from the I&s;thmus of Darien to Cape Horn, in the form of a triangle, goes by the general name of Peruviana, although all the countries included within it do not acknowledge the dominion of the crown of Spain. The heart of the country hath not yet been reduced: the Portugue&s;e are in po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of a large tract, and &s;ome other nations have found means to e&s;tabli&s;h them&s;elves on the coa&s;t. On one &s;ide the Spani&s;h territories reach no farther than from the North Sea to the equinectial, and commence again at Rio de la Plata on the other, the fine country of Brazil occupying the middle &s;pace; and from the River of Plate quite to the Straits of Magellan, the Spaniards rather claim than po&s;&s;e&s;s a real dominion. Indeed, the terri|tories already in their hands are of &s;uch extent, and afford &s;uch va&s;t trea&s;ures, that they have no temp|tations to make either conque&s;ts or di&s;coveries; and the Portugue&s;e are much in the &s;ame &s;ituation. Hence there is a va&s;t tract of interior country, &s;tretching for near two thou&s;and miles from ea&s;t to we&s;t, and above one thou&s;and from &s;outh to north, &s;till po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the natives, and little known to any European nation; but which, there is great rea&s;on to believe, is infinitely rich in gold, &s;ilver, gems, drugs, fruits, cattle, corn, and many other commodities.</P>
<P>The Spani&s;h dominions in South-America are under two governors, &s;tiled viceroys and captain|generals, &s;ubordinate to whom are &s;everal au|diences, as tho&s;e of Panama, Terra-Firma, Chu|qui&s;aca, Quito, Lima, Los Charcas, and Chili, con&s;i&s;ting each of a pre&s;ident and a certain number
<PB N="371" REF="3720">
of coun&s;ellors, appointed by the king, with the in|ferior officers dependent on them. Commonly the viceroys and pre&s;idents hold their authority for &s;e|ven years, and the inferior magi&s;trates for three or four; though the viceroys have power to renew their commi&s;&s;ions, upon their exhibiting proofs of their having faithfully di&s;charged their duty. No|thing, however, is more certain, than that mo&s;t of them look upon their commi&s;&s;ions as a kind of harve&s;t, that will occur but once in their life; and therefore lo&s;e no opportunity to make the mo&s;t of it, by fleecing and oppre&s;&s;ing the people. The &s;tated appointments of the viceroys are not very great; that of the viceroy of Peru, notwith&s;tand|ing the great dignity of the employment, is no more than forty thou&s;and pieces of eight per an|num; but then they have occa&s;ional &s;alaries and perqui&s;ites, which exceed all computation; for this rea&s;on, the&s;e employments are u&s;ually be&s;towed on favourite noblemen of broken fortune, who, by this means, &s;oon lay up &s;ufficient re&s;ources for new &s;cenes of luxury and di&s;&s;ipation.</P>

<HEAD>TERRA-FIRMA.</HEAD>
<P>Terra-Firma, otherwi&s;e called New-Ca&s;tile or Ca&s;tilla del Oro, is bounded by the North-Sea (part of the Atlantic Ocean) on the north; by the &s;ame &s;ea and Guiana on the ea&s;t; by the country of the Amazons and Peru on the &s;outh; and by the Pacific Ocean and Veragua on the we&s;t. It lies between &s;ixty-two and eighty-three degrees of we&s;t longitude, and between the equator and twelve degrees of north latitude; being upwards of twelve hundred miles in length from ea&s;t to we&s;t, and eight hundred in breadth from north to &s;outh. It had the name of Ca&s;tilla del Oro from the quanti|ties
<PB N="372" REF="3730">
of gold found in the di&s;trict of Uraba and other parts; and was fir&s;t di&s;covered by the celebrated Columbus, in his third voyage.</P>
<P>The climate is neither plea&s;ant nor healthy; the inhabitants, one part of the year, being &s;corched by the mo&s;t inten&s;e and burning heat, and the other almo&s;t drowned with perpetual floods of rain, pour|ing from the &s;ky with &s;uch violence as if a general deluge was to en&s;ue.</P>
<P>In &s;o large a tract of country, the &s;oil mu&s;t ne|ce&s;&s;arily vary. Accordingly in &s;ome parts, it is a barren &s;and, or drowned mangrove land, that will &s;carce produce any kind of grain; in others, it yields Indian corn, balms, gums, and drugs, al|mo&s;t all manner of fruits, as well of Old as of New-Spain, &s;ugar, tobacco, Brazil wood, and &s;everal kinds of dying woods; a variety of precious &s;tones, particularly emeralds and &s;apphires; veni&s;on, and other game. The plantations of cacao, or choco|late nuts, in the di&s;trict of the Caraccas, are e&s;teem|ed the be&s;t in America. The mountains abound with tygers, and, according to &s;ome, with lions, and great numbers of other wild bea&s;ts. The ri|vers, &s;eas, and lakes, teem with fi&s;h, and al&s;o with alligators; and the bowels of the earth were once furni&s;hed with the riche&s;t trea&s;ures, now almo&s;t ex|hau&s;ted. The &s;ame may be &s;aid of the pearl-fi&s;he|ries on the coa&s;t, which are far from being &s;o pro|fitable now as formerly.</P>
<P>Terra-Firma is a very mountainous country. Terra-Firma Proper, in particular, con&s;i&s;ts of pro|digious high mountains, and deep vallies, flooded more than half the year. The mountains in the provinces of Carthagena and St. Martha, accord|ing to Dampier, are the highe&s;t in the world, be|ing &s;een at &s;ea two hundred miles off: from the&s;e run a chain of hills, of almo&s;t equal height, quite through South-America, as far as the Straits of Ma|gellan, called the Cordilleras des Andes. The

province of Venezuela al&s;o, and di&s;trict of the Ca|raccas, the mo&s;t northerly parts of South-America, are almo&s;t a continued chain of hills, &s;eparated by &s;mall vallies, pointing upon the coa&s;t of the North-Sea. A chain of barren mountains, almo&s;t impa&s;|&s;able, runs through the province of Popayan, from north to &s;outh, &s;ome whereof are volcanos; but, towards the &s;hores of the Pacific Ocean, it is a low country, flooded great part of the year.</P>
<P>The principal rivers of Terra-Firma are the Darien, Chagtre, Santa Maria, Conception, Rio Grande, or Magdalena, Maricaibo, and Oroonoko.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t con&s;iderable gulphs or bays, whether on the South or North Seas, are the gulphs of Darien, Trie&s;to, Vinezuela, and Paria or Andalu|&s;ia; the bays of Panama, St. Michael, Portobello, Guaira, Curiaco, Carthagena, and Sino. The chief capes are, Samblas Point, Cape Canoa, Cape del A|gua, Swart Point, Cape de Vela, Cape Conquibacoa, Cape Cubelo, Cape Blanco, Cape Galara, Cape Three Points, and Cape Na&s;&s;au; all on the north &s;hore of Terra-Firma.</P>

<P>Terra-Firma Proper lies in the form of a cre&s;cent, about the &s;pacious bay of Panama, being the i&s;th|mus which joins South and North-America; and extending in length, between the two &s;eas, three hundred miles, but in breadth, where the i&s;thmus is narrowe&s;t, only &s;ixty. Here are found gold mines, gold &s;ands, and fine pearls; and though the land is generally rough, there are &s;ome fruitful vallies, watered by rivers, brooks, and &s;prings.

It is &s;trongly fortified and garri&s;on|ed, and the walls mounted with large cannon.

Both the road and whole coa&s;t abound in a great variety of excellent fi&s;h. At the bottom of the &s;ea are found numbers of pearls, and the oy&s;ters in which they are found are remarkably delicious. This kind of fi&s;hery is of great advantage to the inhabitants of all the i&s;lands in the bay; and there are few per&s;ons of &s;ub&s;tance about Penama, who do not employ at lea&s;t a part of their &s;laves in it. The &s;laves thus em|ployed mu&s;t be expert &s;wimmers, and capable of holding their breath a long time. During the &s;ea&s;on, eight, ten, or twenty of them &s;et out, un|der the command of an officer, in a boat, from the i&s;lands, where they have huts built for their lodgings, to &s;uch parts of the bay as are known to produce pearls, and where the depth of the water is not above ten, twelve, or fifteen fathoms. Here they come to an anchor; and the negroes, having a rope fa&s;tened round their bodies, and the other end to the &s;ide of the boat, take with them a &s;mall weight to accelerate their &s;inking, and plunge into the water. On reaching the bottom, they take up an oy&s;ter, which they put under the left arm; the &s;econd they hold in their left hand, and the third in their right; with the&s;e three oy&s;ters, and &s;ometimes another in their mouth, they ri&s;e to breathe, and put them in a bag. When they have re&s;ted them|&s;elves a while, they dive a &s;econd time; and thus continue till they have either compleated their ta&s;k, or their &s;trength fails them. Every one of the&s;e

The remainder, however large or beautiful, are the negro's own property; nor has the ma&s;ter the lea&s;t claim to them, the &s;laves being allowed to &s;ell them to whom they plea&s;e, though the ma&s;ter generally purcha&s;es them at a very &s;mall price.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the toil of this fi&s;hery, from the oy&s;ters adhering &s;trongly to the rocks, the negroes are in no &s;mall danger from &s;ome kinds of fi&s;h, which either &s;eize them, or run again&s;t them &s;o violently as either to kill them, or cru&s;h them again&s;t the bot|tom. Every negro, to defend him&s;elf again&s;t the&s;e animals, carries with him a &s;harp knife, with which the fi&s;h being &s;truck, immediately flies off. The officers keep a watchful eye on the&s;e voracious creatures, and, on di&s;covering them, &s;hake the ropes fa&s;tened to the negroes bodies, that they may be upon their guard. Many, on the diver's being in danger, have thrown them&s;elves into the water, with the like weapon, to a&s;&s;i&s;t in his defence; but all their dexterity and precaution frequently have not been &s;ufficient to protect the diver from being devoured by the&s;e fi&s;h, or lo&s;ing a leg or an arm by their bite.</P>

harbour is &s;o large, deep, and &s;afe, that Columbus, who fir&s;t di&s;covered it, gave it the name of Porto-Bello, or the Fine Harbour, which is now com|monly u&s;ed to denote the town. The number of the hou&s;es is about one hundred and thirty, mo&s;t of them of wood, large and &s;pacious, forming one long &s;treet along the &s;trand, with other &s;maller ones cro&s;&s;ing it. The governor of the town is al|ways a gentleman of the army, &s;ubordinate to the pre&s;ident of Panama; but having under him the commandants of the forts that defend the harbour. At the ea&s;t end of the town, on the road to Pana|ma, is a place called Guinea, where all the negroes of both &s;exes, whether &s;laves or free, have their ha|bitations. This place is very much crouded when the galleons are here; mo&s;t of the inhabitants of the town quitting their hou&s;es entirely, for the &s;ake of letting them; while others content them&s;elves with a &s;mall part, in order to make money of the re&s;t. The Mulattoes, and other poor families al|&s;o, remove either to Guinea or to cottages already erected near it, or built on the occa&s;ion. Great num|bers of artificers likewi&s;e, who flock to Porto-Bello from Panama, to work at their re&s;pective callings during the fair, lodge in Guinea for cheapne&s;s. Towards the &s;ea, in a large tract between the town and Gloria ca&s;tle, barracks are erected, in mo&s;t of which the &s;hips crews keep &s;talls of &s;weetmeats, and other kinds of eatables, brought from Spain; but at the conclu&s;ion of the fair, when the &s;hips put to &s;ea, all the&s;e buildings are taken down, and the town returns to its former tranquillity and empti|ne&s;s. In 1739, the harbour was defended by a ca&s;tle and two forts, which were all demoli&s;hed by Admiral Vernon, who, with &s;ix &s;hips only, made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of this port. The country about Porto-Bello is over-run with mountains and impe|netrable fore&s;ts, except a few vallies, in which are
<PB N="377" REF="3780">
&s;ome &s;cattered farms. Among the mountains that &s;urround the harbour, one di&s;tingui&s;hed by the name of Capiro, and its &s;uperior loftine&s;s, is a &s;ort of barometer to the country, by foretelling every change of the weather. Its top is always covered with clouds, of a den&s;ity and darkne&s;s &s;eldom &s;een in tho&s;e of the atmo&s;phere. When the&s;e clouds thicken, increa&s;e their blackne&s;s, and &s;ink below their u&s;ual &s;tation, it is a &s;ure &s;ign of a tempe&s;t; while, on the other hand, their clearne&s;s and a&s;|cent as certainly indicate the approach of fair wea|ther. The&s;e changes are very &s;udden and fre|quent here. The &s;ummit of the mountain is &s;carce ever clear from clouds; and, when it hap|pens, it is only, as it were, for an in&s;tant. Except in the time of the fair, all the inhabitants of Porto|bello do not amount to three thou&s;and, half of whom are Indians, Mulattoes, or negroes; the Spaniards of any &s;ub&s;tance not chu&s;ing to re&s;ide in a place &s;o extremely unhealthy, and fatal even to the lives of the natives. Ulloa tells us, that the cattle brought hither from Panama or Carthagena, lo&s;e their fle&s;h &s;o fa&s;t in the be&s;t pa&s;tures, as to become &s;carce eat|able: he a&s;&s;ures us al&s;o, that neither hor&s;es or a&s;&s;es are bred here. The heat, indeed, is exce&s;&s;ive, and the torrents of rain &s;o dreadful, &s;udden, and impetuous, that one not accu&s;tomed to them would imagine a &s;econd deluge was a coming. The&s;e torrents al&s;o are accompanied with frightful tempe&s;ts of thunder and lightning, the awfulne&s;s of the &s;cene being heightened by the repercu&s;&s;ions from the mountains, and the &s;hrieks and howlings of multitudes of monkeys of all kinds, which inha|bit the &s;urrounding woods.</P>
<P>Fre&s;h water pours down in &s;treams from the mountains, &s;ome running without the town, and others cro&s;&s;ing it. The&s;e waters are very light and
<PB N="378" REF="3790">
dige&s;tive; qualities which in other countries would be very valuable, but are here pernicious, pro|ducing di&s;&s;enteries, which the patient very &s;eldom &s;urvives. However, the&s;e rivulets, formed into re&s;ervoirs, &s;erve the purpo&s;es of bathing, which is here found to be very conducive to health.</P>
<P>As the fore&s;ts almo&s;t border on the hou&s;es of the town, tygers often make incur&s;ions into the &s;treets during the night, carrying off fowls, dogs, and other dome&s;tic animals, and &s;ometimes even chil|dren have fallen a prey to them. Be&s;ides the &s;nares u&s;ually laid for them, the negroes and mulattoes, who fell wood in the fore&s;ts of the mountains, are very dextrous in encountering them; and &s;ome, for a &s;lender reward, even &s;eek them in their re|treats.</P>
<P>The town of Porto-Bello, which is thinly inha|bited by rea&s;on of its noxious air, the &s;carcity of provi&s;ions, and the barrenne&s;s of the &s;oil, becomes, after the arrival of the galleons, one of the mo&s;t populous towns in the world. He who had &s;een it quite empty, and every place wearing a me|lancholy a&s;pect, would be filled with a&s;toni&s;hment, to &s;ee the bu&s;tling multitudes in the time of the fair, when every hou&s;e is crowded, the &s;quares and &s;treets encumbered with bales of merchandize and che&s;ts of gold and &s;ilver, the harbour full of &s;hips and ve&s;&s;els, &s;ome loaded with provi&s;ions from Carthage|na, and others with the goods of Peru, as cocoa, Je&s;uits bark, Vicuna wool, and Bezoar &s;tones; and this town, at all other times dete&s;ted for its deli|terious qualities, becomes the &s;taple of the riches of the Old and New World, and the &s;cene of one of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable branches of trade in the univer&s;e. Formerly the fair was limited to no par|ticular time; but as a long &s;tay in &s;uch a &s;ickly place extremely affected the health of the traders,
<PB N="379" REF="3800">
his catholic maje&s;ty tran&s;mitted an order that the fair &s;hould not la&s;t above forty days, and that, if in that time the merchants could not agree on their rates, tho&s;e of Spain &s;hould be allowed to carry their goods up the country to Peru; and accord|ingly, the commodore of the galleons has orders to re-embark them, and return to Carthagena; but otherwi&s;e, by virtue of a compact between the merchants of both kingdoms, and ratified by the king, no Spani&s;h trader is to &s;end his goods, on his own account, beyond Porto-Bello. The Engli&s;h were formerly allowed to &s;end a &s;hip annually to this fair, which turned to great account; and, whil&s;t the a&s;&s;iento contract &s;ub&s;i&s;ted, either with the Engli&s;h or the French, one of their principal fac|tories was at Porto-Bello.</P>
<P>In the year 1695, the Scotch parliament pa&s;&s;ed an act for creating a company to trade to Africa, and the Ea&s;t and We&s;t Indies, under his maje&s;ty's letters patent, which the company obtained. The de&s;ign was &s;o plau&s;ible that it induced &s;everal Eng|li&s;h and Hamburgh merchants to engage deeply in the adventure, in con&s;equence of which divers &s;hips were equipped, and a body of forces rai&s;ed to plant a colony on or near the i&s;thmus of Darien. The territory which the adventurers took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of was near the north-we&s; point of the gulph. Here they built the fortre&s;s of New Edinburgh, and denominated the &s;urrounding country Cale|donia. The Indian princes being then at war with the Spaniards, joyfully received the Scotch, in hopes of being able to expel the Spaniards by their a&s;&s;i&s;tance. For &s;ome time the new colony flouri&s;hed extremely; but their good fortune &s;oon met with a check from the jealou&s;y of the Engli&s;h Ea&s;t India company, and the complaints of the court of Madrid. The former complained of a violation of their charter, and the latter of a vio|lation
<PB N="380" REF="3810">
of the treaties &s;ub&s;i&s;ting between Spain and Great Britain. Accordingly the Engli&s;h parliament interpo&s;ed, and addre&s;&s;ed king William to vacate the charter granted to the Scotch company. The Scotch defended their rights with all the arguments of rea&s;on and ju&s;tice; but the influence of their adver&s;aries was too powerful, and all mea&s;ures, the mo&s;t iniquitous, ba&s;e, and tyrannical, were taken to ruin the infant &s;ettlement. The Hamburghers were prevailed on to withdraw their &s;ub&s;criptions; the merchants of London were threatned with the mini&s;terial di&s;plea&s;ure, and orders were &s;ent to the Engli&s;h plantations to deny the coloni&s;ts all pro|vi&s;ions and a&s;&s;i&s;tance. In a word, &s;uch was the power of faction, and private intere&s;t, that the na|tion was robbed of the benefit of one of the mo&s;t u&s;eful e&s;tabli&s;hments ever projected, the advantages of which mu&s;t have appeared in the mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible manner, whenever a rupture happened between England and Spain; for while the I&s;thmus re|mained in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the colony, the Spani&s;h trea&s;ures mu&s;t have been detained in America.</P>
<P>The province of Carthagena is neither rich, fer|tile, nor populous: it produces indeed &s;ome valu|able gums, balms, and drugs, but no mines of gold and &s;ilver, nor any great quantity of corn or cattle.</P>
<P>Carthagena, the metropolis of the province, is not only a fine opulent city, but a &s;trong fortre&s;s, &s;ituate in 10&deg; 25&prime; 48&prime; &frac12; north latitude, and in the longitude of 30&deg; 19&prime; 36&Prime; from the peak of Teneriffe, on a &s;andy i&s;land, called a penin&s;ula by mo&s;t wri|ters. The harbour lies between the i&s;land and the main, and the entrance is at the &s;outh-we&s;t end; the other pa&s;&s;age, called Bocca-chica, having been filled up by order from the court of Spain, &s;ince the un&s;ucce&s;sful attack made upon the town in the year 1741, by admiral Vernon and general
<PB N="381" REF="3820">
Wentworth. To the ea&s;tward the town has a com|munication, by means of a wooden bridge, with a large &s;uburb, called Xexemani, built on an|other i&s;land, which is joined to the continent by a bridge of the &s;ame materials. The fortifications both of the city and &s;uburbs are con&s;tructed in the modern fa&s;hion, and built with free-&s;tone; and, in time of peace the garri&s;on con&s;i&s;ts of ten compa|nies of &s;eventy-&s;even men each, be&s;ides the militia. The city and &s;uburbs are well laid out, the &s;treets &s;treight, broad, uniform, and well paved. The hou&s;es are built of &s;tone or brick, with balconies and lettices of wood, which is more durable in this cli|mate than iron, the latter being &s;oon corroded by the acrimonious quality of the nitrous atmo&s;phere. The city is populous, though mo&s;t of the inhabi|tants are the de&s;cendants of the Indian tribes; but it is by no means opulent, compared with many other cities in South America, the country producing no mines; and even the money for paying the &s;a|laries of the governor and inferior officers, and the garri&s;on, coming from Santa F&egrave; and Quito. Yet there are many per&s;ons who have acquired large fortunes by commerce, who&s;e hou&s;es are &s;plendid, and who live in every re&s;pect with great magnifi|cence. At a &s;mall di&s;tance from the &s;uburb of Xexemani, on a hill, is a fort called St. Lazaro, commanding both the city and &s;uburbs, and afford|ing a very exten&s;ive and agreeable pro&s;pect over the &s;ea and land.</P>
<P>The government of Carthagena was indepen|dent of any other till the year 1739, when the viceroy of New Granada was appointed. It ex|tends about fifty-three leagues, from we&s;t to ea&s;t, and eighty-five from &s;outh to north, containing &s;everal fruitful vallies, called by the natives Savan|nahs, in which are many &s;ettlements of Europeans, Spani&s;h Creoles, and Indians. The bay of Cartha|gena is the fir&s;t place in America at which the gal|leons
<PB N="382" REF="3830">
are allowed to touch; and the public &s;ales on the&s;e occa&s;ions, though far &s;hort of tho&s;e at Porto-Bello, are very con&s;iderable. The traders of the inland provinces of Santa-Fe, Popayan, and Quito, lay out not only their own &s;tock, but al&s;o the monies intru&s;ted to them by commi&s;&s;ions, for &s;everal &s;orts of goods, and tho&s;e &s;pecies of provi|&s;ions which are mo&s;t wanted in their re&s;pective countries. The two provinces of Santa Fe and Po|payan have no other way of &s;upplying them&s;elves with the latter, than from Carthagena. Their traders bring gold and &s;ilver in &s;pecie, ingots, and du&s;t, and al&s;o emeralds; for, be&s;ides the &s;ilver mines at Santa-Fe, which daily increa&s;e by fre&s;h di&s;|coveries, there are others, which yield the fine&s;t emeralds; but the value of the&s;e gems being now fallen in Europe, and particularly in Spain, the trade in them is, by nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equence, greatly declined. All the&s;e mines produce great quantities of gold, which is carried to Choco, and there pays one-fifth to the king, at an office erected for that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>The climate of Carthagena is exce&s;&s;ive hot; yet the inhabitants commonly enjoy a good &s;tate of health, and generally live to a great age. The di&s;ea&s;es that make the greate&s;t havock here, e&s;pe|cially among the Europeans, are a &s;pecies of the vomito prieto, or black vomit, called chapoteado, and the lepro&s;y. The latter is &s;o frequent, that an ho&s;pital hath been erected for patients labouring un|der that loath&s;ome di&s;temper. At Carthagena like|wi&s;e that painful tumour in the mu&s;cles of the legs and thighs, occa&s;ioned by the entrance of the dracuncula or Guinea worm, &s;o common on the coa&s;t of Africa, and in &s;ome of the We&s;t India i&s;lands, is extremely trouble&s;ome, e&s;pecially to the natives. There is another in&s;ect called nigua, peculiar to this coun|try and Peru, where it is called pigue, &s;o extreme|ly
<PB N="383" REF="3840">
&s;mall as &s;carce to be vi&s;ible to the naked eye, which breeds in the du&s;t, and in&s;inuates it&s;elf into the &s;oles of the feet, the toes, and the legs, pierc|ing the &s;kin with &s;uch &s;ubtilty, that there is no be|ing aware of it before it has made its way to the fle&s;h. They cau&s;e an extreme pain, e&s;pecially when they have penetrated deep, as they &s;ometimes do, quite to the bone; and then the inci&s;ion is not on|ly attended with exqui&s;ite torture, but much trou|ble, and real danger.</P>
<P>Proceeding towards the &s;outh, the next province we meet with is Santa Martha, which extends in length about two hundred miles, and in breadth, from ea&s;t to we&s;t, one hundred and forty. It is full of mountains, &s;ome of which are &s;o high that they are covered with &s;now; but abound not only with gold, but with emeralds, &s;apphires, ja&s;per, and marble of an exqui&s;ite vein and poli&s;h. There are al&s;o &s;alt mines in the province.</P>
<P>The capital, which gives name to the province, and is the &s;ee of a bi&s;hop and the re&s;idence of the governor, is a middling town, &s;ituated on a branch of the Rio Grande, and having a direct communi|cation with the North Sea.</P>
<P>On the &s;outhern frontier of Santa Martha lies the little province of Rio de la Hacha. The country is plea&s;ant, tolerably healthy, and exceeding fruitful, having a pearl fi&s;hery on the coa&s;t, and mines of ja&s;|per and chalcedony within land. Rio de la Hacha, the capital, is a &s;mall place at the mouth of the river, about one hundred and twenty miles from Santa Martha.</P>
<P>The province of Venezuela, including the di&s;|trict of Caraccas, lies on the North Sea. It is very large, populous, and fertile, yielding plenty of grain, fruits, cocoa, &s;ugar, and tobacco, and feed|ing great flocks of &s;heep and black cattle; but labours under a &s;carcity of fre&s;h water. Venezu|ela

or Cora, the capital, &s;tands on the North Sea, being the &s;ee of a bi&s;hop, and the re&s;idence of the governor.</P>
<P>Maracaibo is a con&s;iderable town upon the lake of that name.</P>
<P>Caraccas, which gives name to a di&s;trict, is a large wealthy town within land. In the &s;ame di&s;|trict is al&s;o Porto-Cavallo, a &s;ea-port town. A great contraband trade is carried on by the Engli&s;h and Dutch on this coa&s;t, in &s;pite of all the vigi|lance of the Spaniards.</P>
<P>Beyond the province of Venezuela lies that of New-Andalu&s;ia, which, including the di&s;tricts of Comona and Paria, is of great extent. The pro|duce of this country chiefly con&s;i&s;ts in dying-drugs, gums, medicinal roots, Brazil-wood, &s;ugar, tobac|co, and &s;ome valuable timber, the interior parts being woody and mountainous; but inter&s;per&s;ed with fine vallies, that yield corn and pa&s;turage.</P>
<P>Comana, or, as &s;ome writers call it, New-Cordu|ba, the capital, &s;tands about nine miles from the North-Sea. The town of St. Thomas is generally &s;et down as the capital of New-Andalu&s;ia, though it is certainly &s;ituated without the limits thereof, in the juri&s;diction of Surinam, near the mouth of the great river Oronooko.</P>
<P>New-Granada, called &s;ometimes Santa-Fe, and Ca&s;tella del Oro, is an inland province of great extent, beautifully diver&s;ified with mountains and valleys. The mountains contain gold, &s;ilver, and emeralds, and the vallies produce corn, cattle, roots, and fruits, with great quantities of guaiacum, balms, gums, drugs of various kinds, with other rich articles of commerce. Santa Fe de Bogata, the capital not only of this province, but of all Terra Firma, and the &s;eat of the viceroy, of the royal audience, and an archbi&s;hop, is a large, populous, opulent, and well built city, &s;ituated on the banks
<PB N="385" REF="3860">
of a lake, with altars at &s;tated di&s;tances, higher than the hou&s;es, on which, as on the arches, may be &s;een amazing quantities of the riche&s;t wrought plate and jewels. Ulloa ob&s;erves, that the o&s;tenta|tion and emulation of the inhabitants of Quito, in their funerals, is &s;o extraordinory, that they may be &s;aid to toil, &s;cheme, and endure the greate&s;t la|bour and fatigue, merely to enable their &s;ucce&s;&s;ors to lavi&s;h honours upon a carca&s;e in&s;en&s;ible to all pa|geantry.</P>
<P>Of the other towns in Quito, the principal are Guiaquil and Paita.</P>
<P>Guiaquil is a con&s;iderable town, at the mouth of the river from which it takes its name. The com|merce here con&s;i&s;ts chiefly in cocoa, timber, &s;alt, horned cattle, mules, hides, tobacco, wax, Guinea|pepper, drugs, and a kind of cotton, called loua de ciebo, &s;o extremely fine that no method of &s;pinning it hath hitherto been invented. The Guiaquil is here about two miles over, and the navigation of it performed by &s;mall ve&s;&s;els, canoes, and balzas or rafts, which the Indians &s;teer with &s;urprizing dexte|rity.</P>
<P>Paita is a &s;mall &s;ea port, that was taken by com|modore (late lord) An&s;on, in 1741. The &s;oil round Paita is &s;andy and barren; for, be&s;ides the total want of rain, there is not &s;o much as a &s;mall rivulet near it; &s;o that the inhabitants are obliged to fetch that nece&s;&s;ary fluid from Colan, a town on the &s;ame bay, at the di&s;tance of four leagues.</P>
<P>The natives of Terra-Firma and Quito have ne|ver been thoroughly &s;ubdued, and probably never will, as they are not only a gallant, warlike people, but have almo&s;t impregnable fa&s;tne&s;&s;es to retire to, and bear an inveterate hatred to the Spaniards. On the I&s;thmus of Darien they have lank, coar&s;e, black hair, which generally hangs down to the mid|dle of their back. Their natural complexion is a
<PB N="386" REF="3870">
copper colour, or orange-tawny; and their eye-brows are naturally as black as jet. They anoint them&s;elves all over with oil, to render their &s;kins &s;mooth, &s;leek, and &s;upple. Both men and women paint their bodies with the figures of men, bea&s;ts, birds, trees, and the like: the women are the painters, and their chief colours are red, yellow, and blue, which are very bright. They wear no cloaths, only the women have a clout, that is tied before and behind, by a &s;tring, round their middles. The men go quite naked, without &s;o much as a clout; but they have a piece of &s;ilver or gold plate, in the &s;hape of a half-moon, hanging over their mouths, and pinching the bridle of their no&s;e with its points. The women have rings in the gri&s;tles of their no&s;es, which hang over their mouths; but the&s;e, in both &s;exes, are chiefly worn on &s;ome public occa&s;ions, and they always take them off at meals. Be&s;ides the&s;e, the men, women, and children wear &s;trings or chains of teeth, &s;hells, beads, and the like, which hang down from the neck upon the brea&s;t. She mu&s;t be a poor woman who has not fifteen or twenty pounds weight of the&s;e &s;trings; but they do not wear them when in their hou&s;es. The women take care of the plantations; and the men build the hou&s;es or huts, and go a hunting or fi&s;hing. Their arms are bows, arrows, lances, and daggers, or great knives; and many of them of late u&s;e fire-arms, which they purcha&s;e of the Eu|ropeans. When a woman is brought to bed, ano|ther takes her and her child to the river, and wa&s;hes them. The child, after the fir&s;t month, is laid upon a board, as in Virginia and Carolina. Some writers tell us al&s;o, that be&s;ides the dark complec|tioned Indians, there are &s;ome of a pure milk-white, without the lea&s;t tincture of red; having al&s;o the hair of their head and eye-brows white, and $Word$, &s;hort, milk-white down upon their bodies.</P>

The cruelties and ravages committed by Pedro|rias and others, who fir&s;t reduced the&s;e provinces under the crown of Spain, almo&s;t exceed belief. Pedrorias and his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors did not de&s;troy le&s;s in Terra-Firma only, than eight hundred thou&s;and people; and plundered the country of &s;everal mil|lions of gold. The governor and his officers, eve|ry day, invented new torments, to make the Indians di&s;cover their gold; &s;ome they racked, others they burnt by inches, till they expired in torments. Many thou&s;ands were de&s;troyed on the coa&s;t of New-Andalu&s;ia, by being obliged to dive for pearls beyond their &s;trength. It was a common thing to cut off the no&s;es of men and women in &s;port, and give them to the dogs. They kept packs of great ma&s;tiffs, on purpo&s;e to hunt and tear in pieces the Indians; and would often kill an Indian without any offence given, and lend a brother Spaniard a quarter of a man, as one would lend a neighbour a quarter of pork or mutton, to feed their dogs.</P>
<P>The greate&s;t prince of the country, named Ba|gota, from whom the capital city was afterwards called Santa F&eacute; de Bagota, after he had brought in a prodigious quantity of gold, by di&s;patching ex|pre&s;&s;es to every part of his dominions, was &s;o tor|tured, to make him produce more, that he expired under the hands of his mercile&s;s per&s;ecutors.</P>

<HEAD>PERU.</HEAD>
<P>Peru, formerly a powerful empire, extended from 60 to 81&deg;. of we&s;t longitude, and from the equator to the 25&deg;, of &s;outh latitude, that is, near two thou&s;and miles from north to &s;outh, and about five hundred, where broade&s;t, from ea&s;t to we&s;t; being bounded by Popayan on the north; by the Cordilleras des Andes, which &s;eparate it from the country of the Amazons and Paraguay or La Plata,
<PB N="388" REF="3890">
on the ea&s;t; by Chili, and La Plata, properly &s;o called, on the &s;outh; and by the Pacific Ocean, or South-Sea, on the we&s;t; but the province la&s;t de&s;cribed on the north, is now under the viceroy of Santa F&eacute; de Bagota, and not of Peru; the latter, however, pre&s;ides over a va&s;t extent of country; viz. the re&s;t of Peru, Jucatan, Paraguay, and Chili.</P>
<P>The coa&s;t of Peru, along the Pacific Ocean, is a high bold &s;hore. About thirty miles within land, is a chain of mountains, called the Sierras; and beyond the&s;e, about eighty miles, are prodigious high mountains, called the Cordilleras des Andes, which, with the Sierras, run the whole length of South-America, upwards of three thou&s;and miles. The upper parts of them are always covered with &s;now, and the air is &s;o pure and &s;ubtle that it is not fit for re&s;piration; accordingly, there are no ani|mals upon them, wild or tame. It never rains in that part of the country which lies near the &s;ea|coa&s;t, unle&s;s within three or four degrees of the equator, which lie within the province of Quito; but the country is well watered by the rivers, which fall from the Andes into the South-Sea: the&s;e they turn into their fields and gardens, and, by that means, have their vintage and harve&s;t at what time they plea&s;e, this being the only country betwixt the tropics that affords wine. The wind blows continually from the &s;outh or &s;outh-we&s;t, at &s;ea, near the coa&s;t. The weather is bright, when the &s;un is in the northern &s;igns, and hazy, when &s;outh of the equator, though no rain falls.</P>
<P>The land along the &s;ea-&s;hore is a dry barren &s;and, except in &s;ome few places. The Sierras are al&s;o barren hills; but the low grounds and vallies, at the bottom of them, are fruitful, producing al|mo&s;t all manner of grain and fruits. This part of the country is the be&s;t inhabited, being not only
<PB N="389" REF="3900">
the mo&s;t fruitful, but the mo&s;t temperate; for the &s;andy plains, near the &s;ea, are exce&s;&s;ive hot.</P>
<P>The Peruvian &s;heep, called pacos or huancu, are of the bigne&s;s of a &s;tag, and re&s;emble a camel. The body is covered with a coar&s;e kind of wool; they are very tractable, and were formerly the only bea&s;ts of burthen among the Indians. Their fle&s;h is very good meat, and e&s;teemed as innocent as a chicken. Their height is from four feet to four and a half. They generally carry an hun|dred-weight; and walk, holding their heads up, with wonderful gravity and maje&s;ty, and &s;o regular a pace, that no beating will make them alter it. At night, it is impo&s;&s;ible to make them move with their burthen; they lie down till it is taken off, to go and graze. Their common food is a &s;ort of gra&s;s, &s;omewhat like a &s;mall ru&s;h, with which all the mountains are covered. The&s;e &s;heep eat little, and never drink; &s;o that they are very ea&s;ily kept. Ths Spaniards u&s;e them in the mines, to carry the ore to the mills. The vicunnas are &s;haped much like the pacos, only they are &s;maller and lighter. The Spaniards call them Indian goats, becau&s;e they al&s;o re&s;emble that animal. Their wool is very fine, and much valued; be&s;ides, the bezoar &s;tone, which is &s;aid to expel poi&s;on, and to perform many notable cures, is found in them. Their deer are much le&s;s than ours. They have not many wild bea&s;ts; and &s;uch as they have are not very fierce and dan|gerous. The cattle imported from Europe are va&s;tly increa&s;ed; and mo&s;t of them run wild, and are hunted, like other game. The Peruvians had no tame fowl, but the nuana, &s;omewhat re&s;embling the duck, but much larger.</P>
<P>Among their fore&s;t trees, the mo&s;t valuable is the quinquina, ot Je&s;uits bark, which grows in the mountains of Poto&s;i, and al&s;o in the province of Quito. It is about the &s;ize of a cherry tree, the
<PB N="390" REF="3910">
leaves round and indented, and bears a long red|di&s;h flower, from whence ari&s;es a pod, with a kernel like an almond; but neither the kernel nor the fruit have the &s;ame virtues as the bark. In the plains of Truxillo there is a &s;ort of tree, which bears twenty or thirty flowers, all of them different, and of divers colours, hanging together like a bunch of grapes. From a tree, called maguey, they get honey, vinegar, and drink. The &s;talks and leaves are not only good to eat, but may be wrought like hemp; from them al&s;o they draw the thread called pica. The wood &s;erves to cover hou&s;es; the prickles, or thorns, for needles; and the Indians u&s;e the fruit in&s;tead of &s;oap. Sar&s;apa|rilla, dragon's blood, &s;ome rhubarb, tamarinds, Camina oil, &s;torax, guaiacum, and &s;everal &s;orts of gums and drugs, ananas, guavoes, patalas, bananas, and melons are produced here, be&s;ides many other fruits and vegetables. They have likewi&s;e plenty of European corn, wine, and oil, with apples, pears, figs, &amp;c. The ca&s;&s;avi root they make bread of here, as in other parts of America. Mo&s;t of the bal&s;am that bears the name of Peru, and proceeds from the trunk and branches of a little tree, comes from Mexico.</P>
<P>Gold is found in every province of Peru, wa&s;hed down from the mountains; and there are plenty of &s;ilver mines, of which the riche&s;t are tho&s;e of Po|to&s;i, di&s;covered in 1545. They con&s;i&s;t of &s;olid rock; and the ore is &s;o hard that they break it with hammers, and it &s;plits as if it were flint.</P>
<P>The quick&s;ilver mines, near Lima, were not di&s;|covered till 1567; and the Spaniards did not be|gin to refine their &s;ilver with mercury at Poto&s;i, till 1571.</P>
<P>All the natives of this empire now acknowledge them&s;elves &s;ubjects of Spain, and outwardly, at lea&s;t, make profe&s;&s;ion of popery, though they ge|nerally
<PB N="391" REF="3920">
retain a &s;trong inclination towards their an|tient idolatry. Not only tho&s;e that work in the mines, but all the re&s;t in general, are treated in the mo&s;t in&s;olent, bruti&s;h, and oppre&s;&s;ive manner by the Spaniards, both clergy and laity; only it is &s;aid, the Je&s;uits, before their &s;uppre&s;&s;ion, u&s;ed them much more civilly than the re&s;t of their country|men, and, by that means, had a great a&s;cendency over them, and were much loved and re&s;pected by them.</P>
<P>The native Peruvians are generally of a middling &s;tature and olive complexion: their hair, as tha of all other people between the tropics, is always black; mo&s;t of them have their heads &s;haved, and the hair of their beards, and other parts of their bodies, is pulled up, from time to time, with tweez|ers, whenever any appears, except that on their eye-brows and eye-lids, at lea&s;t, &s;uch was their practice, when the Spaniards fir&s;t &s;ettled among them; but the manners of the greater part, with|out doubt, are much changed now, though, per|haps, not for the better.</P>
<P>Their principal manufactures, at the above-men|tioned period, were woollen and cotton cloths, which they wove, and dyed into all manner of co|lours; but no man was &s;uffered to wear a garment, cap, or turbant, of different colours, but tho&s;e of the royal blood. The carpets on which they lay were made of the wool of their country &s;heep, or the fine hair of their goats; and their hammocks of cotton, or net-work. They had little or no trade, either with foreigners, or with one another: every family having its plantation, and almo&s;t all nece&s;&s;a|ries within it&s;elf.</P>
<P>Their carpenters had no other tools than hatchets, made of copper or flint; their &s;tone-cutters no other tools than &s;harp flints and pebbles; and pullies, and other engines, were entirely unknown to them;
<PB N="392" REF="3930">
yet, under all the&s;e di&s;advantages, they rai&s;ed &s;trong and magnificent edifices. Their needles were thorns, or fine bones, and their threads the &s;inews of animals, or the fibres of plants, or of the bark of a certain tree; &s;ci&s;&s;ars they had none; and their knives were flint, or copper: their combs were made of long thorns, &s;et on each &s;ide of a piece of cane, which &s;erved for the back of the comb; and the razors they &s;haved their heads with were no better than &s;harp flints; in which operation the pa|tient &s;uffered &s;o much, that there was nothing the Spaniards carried over more acceptable to them, than the razors and &s;ci&s;&s;ars: they had no looking-gla&s;&s;es; but, in&s;tead of them, the Peruvian ladies made u&s;e of a round plate of poli&s;hed bra&s;s, or copper; and in this the natives of the Ea&s;t-Indies agree with them, having no other mirrors at this day than what they get of the Europeans. The &s;everal nations were di&s;tingui&s;hed by their head|dre&s;&s;es; &s;ome wearing a kind of turbant of cotton-linen, others a &s;ingle piece, others a kind of hats, and others caps in the form of a &s;ugar|loaf, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Nothing &s;truck them more than the blackne&s;s of the negroe-&s;laves that the Spaniards brought with them; they could not believe it to be na|tural, having never &s;een a black in America; they de&s;ired the Spaniards, therefore, to let them make experiment, and try if they could not wa&s;h off the black paint, as they took it to be.</P>
<P>The Peruvians exceed mo&s;t nations in the world in quickne&s;s of wit, and &s;trength of judgment. Such of them as have had the advantage of ma&s;t|ers, &s;ince the arrival of the Spaniards, have general|ly made an extraordinary proficiency. When the Spaniards fir&s;t appeared among them, they ac|knowledged one Almighty being, maker of heaven and earth, whom they called Pacha-Camac, i. e.
<PB N="393" REF="3940">
the &s;oul of the univer&s;e; but they &s;eldom erected Temples, or offered &s;acrifices to him. The next object of their adoration was the Sun, to which they offered &s;acrifices of all &s;orts of cattle, e&s;pecially lambs and fowls, corn, and even the be&s;t and fine&s;t clothes, all which they burnt in the place of incen&s;e, rendering their thanks and prai&s;es to the Sun, for having &s;u&s;tained and nouri&s;hed all tho&s;e things for the u&s;e and &s;upport of mankind. They had al&s;o their drink-offerings, made of Indian corn &s;teeped in water.</P>
<P>All the prie&s;ts of the Sun, that officiated in the city of Cu&s;co, were of the blood royal. Be&s;ides the wor&s;hip of the Sun, they paid &s;ome adoration to the images of &s;everal animals and vegetables, that had a place in their temple.</P>
<P>They had four grand fe&s;tivals annually, be&s;ides tho&s;e they celebrated every moon. The fir&s;t, cal|led Raymi, was held in the month of June, im|mediately after the &s;ummer &s;ol&s;tice, with great pomp and &s;olemnity, in honour of the Sun, and in commemoration of the fir&s;t inca, Manca Capac, and Caya Mama-Ocla, his wife and &s;i&s;ter.</P>
<P>It is evident, that they believed the &s;oul &s;urvived the body, by the &s;ncas con&s;tantly declaring that they &s;hould go to re&s;t, or into a &s;tate of happine&s;s, provided for them by their God and father the Sun, when they left this world.</P>
<P>As to the Creolians here, though almo&s;t utter &s;trangers to true religion, they are &s;aid to be &s;uper|&s;titious even to a higher degree, than the Spaniards of Europe. They are very careful to &s;ay their ro&s;ary often every day, and to provide a religious habit, to die and be buried in; being per&s;uaded, that when clad in alivery &s;o much re&s;pected here below, they &s;hall, without any difficulty, be admitted into heaven. They &s;carce know what it is to pray to God, but addre&s;s them&s;elves only to the Virgin and the &s;aints.</P>
<P><PB N="394" REF="3950">
The mo&s;t beggarly and meane&s;t of the Europe. ans become gentlemen, as &s;oon as they find them|&s;elves tran&s;ported among the Indians, blacks, mu|lattoes, Me&s;tizoes &amp;c. Any good or generous ac|tions performed by them are the effects of their vanity and imaginary nobility.</P>
<P>The Creolians are &s;aid to bear a great antipathy to the native Spaniards, of which one rea&s;on is &s;up|po&s;ed to be, becau&s;e they &s;ee tho&s;e &s;trangers in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the prime places of the &s;tate. In their outward behaviour they affect great gravity, like European Spaniards, to whom they are not in|ferior in wit and genius, acutene&s;s, and under&s;tand|ing, but le&s;s active and hardy.</P>
<P>Effeminacy and &s;loth &s;eem to be peculiar to the country, becau&s;e it is too good; for it is ob|&s;erved, that tho&s;e who have been bread to labour in Spain, grow idle here in a &s;hort time, like the Creolians. They are &s;ober as to wine, but eat a great deal, and after an indecent manner, &s;ometimes all out of the &s;ame di&s;h, and without forks.</P>
<P>In matters of love, the Creolians yield to no na|tion, freely &s;acrificing to that pa&s;&s;ion, mo&s;t of what they have; and though covetous upon all other occa&s;ions, they are generous beyond mea&s;ure to women. There is nothing &s;candalous here in con|cubinage; nay, it is a &s;ort of di&s;grace not to keep mi&s;tre&s;s. It is even frequent enough to &s;ee married men for&s;ake their wives, to adhere to mulattoes and blacks. Ba&s;tards are as much regarded as the lawfully begotten, provided they are owned by the father; and there is no di&s;grace inherent to that birth.</P>
<P>The clergy, e&s;pecially the inferior &s;ort, and the friars, if not much belied, exceed the laity in libertini&s;m almo&s;t as much as they do in wealth, pride, and lazine&s;s. The Je&s;uits are &s;aid to have been richer here than in Mexico, in which their confi&s;cated e&s;tates and effects were computed to a|mount
<PB N="395" REF="3960">
to the immen&s;e value of &s;eventy-&s;even mil|lions of pia&s;ters, or three hundred and eighty-five millions of French livres.</P>
<P>The Creolian women, though not &s;hut up, as they are in Spain, yet &s;eldom go abroad by day; but at night, 'tis &s;aid, they go a courting, and tho&s;e who are mode&s;te&s;t by day, are then the bolde&s;t, their faces being covered with their veils. They are, for the mo&s;t part, &s;prightly enough, and their complexion good, but not la&s;ting. Tho&s;e propo&s;als, which a lover would not dare to make in another country, without the indignation of a mode&s;t woman, are &s;o far from &s;candalizing here, that they are reckoned e&s;&s;ential to gallantry: in&s;tead of taking offence at them, as indicating an ill opinion of their virtue, they return thanks, as for an honour done to them.</P>
<P>Before the appointment of a viceroy at Santa F&eacute; in new Granada, Peru contained the three audiences of Lima, or Los Reyes, Los Charcas, or La Plata, and Quito, but now only the two former, and not even the whole of the&s;e; for, according to Don Ulloa, the audience of Los Charcas comprehends Tucuman and Paraguay.</P>
<P>The audience of Lima, or Los Reyes is bounded on the north by Quito; on the ea&s;t, by the Cordil|lera mountains; on the &s;outh, by the audience of Los Charcas; and, on the we&s;t, by the Pacific Ocean, being about &s;even hundred and &s;eventy miles in length, from &s;outh to north, but of unequal breadth. The climate and &s;oil are &s;aid to vary greatly in this audience, e&s;pecially the former; and that in the compa&s;s of a few miles, in which all the vici&s;&s;itudes of weather are &s;ometimes experienced in twenty-four hours.</P>
<P>Lima, the capital not only of this audience but of all Peru, is &s;ituated in a &s;pacious and delightful valley, not far from the &s;ea, in the latitude of 12&deg; 2&prime; 31&Prime;. &s;outh. A river of the &s;ame name wa&s;hes the
<PB N="396" REF="3970">
walls, over which there is, or was, a hand&s;ome &s;tone bridge; for no longer ago than the year 1746, on the 28th of October, a dreadful &s;hock of an earthquake almo&s;t entirely de&s;troyed this city in the &s;pace of three minutes, burying in the ruins tho&s;e inhabi|tants, who, endeavouring to &s;ave their mo&s;t precious moveables, had not made &s;ufficient ha&s;te into the &s;treets and &s;quares At the &s;ame time, the &s;ea re|ceding to a con&s;iderable di&s;tance, returned with &s;uch violence, that Callao, which was the port of Lima, and all the neighbouring country were laid under water; men, women and hou&s;es being &s;wept away with the torrent; nineteen ve&s;&s;els out of twen|ty-three were &s;unk, and the frigate, called St. Fir|min, was carried by the force of the waves to a great di&s;tance up the country. For the &s;pace of four months the concu&s;&s;ions continued, with &s;hort intervals, and many of them were as violent as the fir&s;t; &s;o that before the twenty-fourth of the follow|ing year, no le&s;s than four hundred and fifty &s;hocks had been felt, &s;ome of them no le&s;s dreadful than the fir&s;t. Above twelve thou&s;and lives peri&s;hed in the ruins of their own effects and property. It is probable it hath now, in a great mea&s;ure, recovered its former &s;plen|dor; but how far, we cannot po&s;itively &s;ay. Howe|ver, it is &s;till the capital and great emporium of Peru, and the re&s;idence of the viceroy, who&s;e government is triennial; though at the expiration of that term, the &s;overeign may renew his commi&s;&s;ion. He en|joys all the pomp and prerogatives of royalty. All officers are appointed, and places filled up by him. For the &s;ecurity of his per&s;on, he has two corps of guards, one of hor&s;e and the other of halbardiers. The hor&s;e guards con&s;i&s;t of one hundred and &s;ixty, under the command of a captain and lieutenant: their uniforms are blue, laced with &s;ilver. The hal|bardiers, in number fifty, are clad in crim&s;on-velvet wai&s;tcoats, deeply laced with gold, and do duty in rooms leading to the royal audience chamber.
<PB N="397" REF="3980">
Be&s;ides the&s;e, there is another guard within the palace, of a hundred men, being a detachment from the garri&s;on of Callao. All are occa&s;ionally em|ployed in executing the orders of the viceroy, and enforcing the decrees of the tribunals, after they have received the royal a&s;&s;ent; for &s;uch the con|currence of the viceroy is e&s;teemed, who, be&s;ides a&s;&s;i&s;ting at the courts of ju&s;tice, and councils, gives daily audience to all degrees of per&s;ons. The &s;upreme tribunal at Lima, called audienca, is held in the viceroy's palace, and con&s;i&s;ts of eight auditors, and a fi&s;cal, for civil affairs. Here is al&s;o a chamber of accounts, a board of trea&s;ury, a court for the effects of per&s;ons dying inte&s;tate, and without law|ful heirs, a council of commerce, and a tribunal of the inqui&s;ition, many convents, chapels and ho&s;pitals, with an univer&s;ity, in which are profe&s;&s;ors of the &s;everal &s;ciences, and three &s;ubordinate col|leges. The inhabitants of this city, as of all the others in Spani&s;h America, con&s;i&s;t of Spaniards, Me&s;tizoes, Mulattoes, Indians, and Negroes. The Spani&s;h families were very numerous; there having been no fewer, at a moderate computation, before the earthquake, than eighteen thou&s;and whites in this capital, a third or fourth part of whom con&s;i&s;ted of the chief nobility in Peru. The great kept coaches and cala&s;hes, and chai&s;es were &s;o common, that no family of any note was without one. The number of mules and camels was com|puted at eight thou&s;and, whence we may judge of the populou&s;ne&s;s of the city, and the opu|lence of the inhabitants, who were reckoned to a|mount to &s;eventy thou&s;and, including all degrees; and to expend in rich &s;ilks, laces, pearls, and jewels, above a million &s;terling annually. If Lima was not &s;ubject to earthquakes, it would be one of the mo&s;t de&s;irable places of abode in the world; but, unhappily, the interval between the&s;e is never of a length &s;ufficient to obliterate the remembrance of
<PB N="398" REF="3990">
them: however, though frequent and &s;udden, they never fail to give a &s;hort warning of their approach by a rumbling noi&s;e in the bowels of the earth, which is in&s;tantly followed by di&s;mal howlings of the dogs. The bea&s;ts of burthen too, which hap|pen to be pa&s;&s;ing the &s;treets, &s;top, and by a natural in&s;tinct throw open their legs, the better to &s;ecure them&s;elves from falling. Lima is not only the capi|tal of Peru and the &s;eat of the government, but the centre of all the trade carried on throughout South-America, di&s;tributing through the provinces the va|rious products and manufactures, both of A&s;ia and Europe, and receiving in return the &s;uperfluities of each, to be &s;ent either to Europe, or to other cities and towns on the continent: in particular, all the wealth of the &s;outhern provinces, being brought to Lima, is embarked on board the fleet, which &s;ails from Callao to Panama, about the time that the galleons arrive from Europe. The proprietors of the trea&s;ure tran&s;mit it to the merchants of Lima, who traffic at the fair with this and their own &s;tock. The &s;ame fleet, in returning, touches at Paita, where the European merchandizes of va|lue, purcha&s;ed at Porto-Bello fair, are landed, in order to avoid the delay and danger of &s;ailing to Callao, and &s;ent on droves of mules to Lima; but tho&s;e of le&s;s value are carried thither by &s;ea.</P>
<P>Callao, the port of Lima, lies &s;ix miles we&s;t of it. The Spaniards have no harbour to compare with this in the South-Sea, for beauty, conveni|ence, and &s;ecurity; the large&s;t ve&s;&s;els may lie with perfect &s;afety in the road of Callao, the water being extremely deep, and the port &s;creened from the winds by the i&s;land of St. Laurence, which al&s;o breaks the &s;urges rolling from the &s;outh-we&s;t. Before the la&s;t earthquake, neither the garri&s;on nor fortifications were con&s;iderable; and the inhabitants did not exceed four or five hundred. We may judge of the importance of this harbour, from what
<PB N="399" REF="4000">
we have &s;aid of the commerce of Lima. Two flotas annually &s;ail from hence; one for Arica, near Poto&s;i, about the end of February, which, having received the &s;ilver on board, returns in the month of March; the other for Panama, in the beginning of May, with all the trea&s;ures and merchandize of Poto&s;i, Chili, and Peru: tho&s;e of Chili are brought by the Valparai&s;o fleet. Be&s;ides the&s;e fleets, two &s;hips &s;ail annually for Acapulco, freighted with gold and &s;ilver; and the commodities they bring back are lodged in magazines here, and retailed to all the &s;outhern provinces of America.</P>
<P>The other places of any note in this audience are, Cu&s;co, Ariquiba, Guamanga, Truxillo, Guamcha|co, and Sangallo.</P>
<P>Cu&s;co, the capital of the empire of Peru before the arrival of the Spaniards, and the &s;eat of the In|cas, &s;tands above three hundred and twenty-&s;ix miles from Lima towards the ea&s;t. It was then very large, magnificent, and populous. Here &s;tood the famous Temple of the Sun, which was called Curiachanchi, and contained immen&s;e riches. The incas re&s;ided in a part of the citadel, the walls of which were incru&s;ted with gold and &s;ilver, and the whole fortre&s;s was built of &s;tones, &s;o long that &s;e|veral oxen could hardly draw one of them.</P>
<P>Cu&s;co is &s;till a con&s;iderable town, containing about fifteen or &s;ixteen thou&s;and Spaniards, Creo|lians, and Indians. The air is &s;aid to be very pure and whole&s;ome, and the neighbouring country very plea&s;ant and fruitful. Here are &s;ome manufactures of bays and cotton cloth, and leather; and in the adjacent mountains are gold and &s;ilver mines.</P>
<P>Arequiba &s;tands about one hundred leagues to the &s;outh of Lima, in the valley of Quiloa, on a fine river, by which it has a communication with the &s;ea, di&s;tant about twenty leagues. It is one of the mo&s;t beautiful and plea&s;ant towns in all Peru,
<PB N="400" REF="4010">
and enjoys a good air; but is very &s;ubject to earth|quakes. A part of the &s;ilver of Poto&s;i and Los Charcas is brought hither to be &s;ent to Callao.</P>
<P>Guamanga is a pretty large town, one hundred and eighty miles from Lima towards the ea&s;t. Here is the &s;ee of a bi&s;hop, and an univer&s;ity, with profe&s;&s;ors of divinity, philo&s;ophy, and law. The trade of this town con&s;i&s;ts chiefly in gilt leather, a &s;pecies of pavilions for beds, confecti|onary pa&s;tes, marmalades, jellies, pre&s;erved quin|ces, and other articles of luxury. The air is &s;aid to be very fine and &s;erene.</P>
<P>Truxillo is one of the principal cities of Peru, &s;tanding two hundred and fifty miles from Lima towards the north-we&s;t, and about half a league from the &s;ea, in a &s;andy &s;oil. The hou&s;es are all low, on account of the frequent earthquakes, with which all the &s;ea coa&s;t is vi&s;ited. The inhabitants carry on a prodigious trade in wine, brandy, &s;ugar, flax, and marmalade. Guamchaco is a &s;mall port, two leagues from Truxillo, but neither &s;afe nor commodious.</P>
<P>Sangallo is another &s;ea-port, about twenty-&s;ix leagues to the &s;outhward of Lima, which carries on &s;ome trade.</P>
<P>The audience of Los Charcas, or La Plata, is equal in the extent of its juri&s;diction to that of Lima; but many parts of it is over-run with fo|re&s;ts and va&s;t de&s;erts. It is bounded by the au|dience of Lima on the north; by Paraguay on the ea&s;t; by Chili and Tucuman on the &s;outh; and by the Pacific Ocean on the we&s;t, extending from 25 to 17&deg;. 10&prime;. &s;outh latitude, that is five hundred and &s;eventy miles in a &s;trait line; but taking in the windings of the coa&s;t, above &s;ix hun|dred miles; and from ea&s;t to we&s;t, where broad|e&s;t, about four hundred miles.</P>
<P><PB N="401" REF="4020">
The climate is various, the coa&s;ts being in&s;uf|ferably hot, while the inland parts are rather upon the other extreme.</P>
<P>The &s;oil is, generally &s;peaking, fruitful, e&s;pe|cially in vallies among the mountains, in the in|land parts, mo&s;t of which are well watered. The principal commodities of the country are &s;ilver, gold, pimento, commonly called Jamaica pepper, which produces to the inhabitants a neat return of &s;ix hundred thou&s;and pieces of eight annually. Throughout the whole extent of the audience are exceeding rich mines, &s;ome near the coa&s;t, and others in the inland parts.</P>
<P>The principal towns in this audience are La Plata, Poto&s;i, La Paz, Atacoma, Arica, Ylo, and Santa Cruz de la Sierra.</P>
<P>La Plata, the capital, which had its name from the mines in its neighbourhood, &s;tands about two hundred and fifty miles from the neare&s;t &s;ea-coa&s;t to the ea&s;t, and &s;even hundred and eighty from Lima, towards the &s;outh-ea&s;t. The inhabitants, including Indians, are &s;aid to exceed fourteen thou|&s;and. Here is the &s;eat of the governor of the province, of the archbi&s;hop, an univer&s;ity, and court of inqui&s;ition, &s;ubordinate to that of Lima; but there is a great &s;carcity of water.</P>
<P>Poto&s;i, &s;o famous on account of the rich &s;ilver mines in its neighbourhood, &s;tands about &s;ixty miles from La Plata to the &s;outh-ea&s;t. The Spa|niards and Creolians here are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of immen&s;e riches. All their cloaths are of gold and &s;ilver &s;tuffs, and their kitchen furniture and plates of &s;ilver, which is not to be wondered at in a country where that metal is as common as copper and iron are el&s;ewhere. They have great fro&s;ts and &s;nows here in May, June, and July; and the neighbour|ing country is barren and uncouth, e&s;pecially the mountains, that contain the mines. The town is
<PB N="402" REF="4030">
&s;aid to be near two leagues in compa&s;s, and con|&s;equently the large&s;t in Peru. There are four principal mines of &s;ilver, be&s;ides other &s;maller ones. Notwith&s;tanding the barrenne&s;s of the country, the town is well provided with every nece&s;&s;ary, &s;ome provinces &s;ending the be&s;t of their grain and fruit, others their cattle, and others their manufactures. Tho&s;e who trade in European commodities, re|&s;ort to Poto&s;i, as to a market, where they are &s;ure of converting their merchandize into &s;ilver. Another &s;pecies of commerce, carried on by a &s;et of people called Aviadores, con&s;i&s;ts in exchanging coin, towards paying the nece&s;&s;ary expences of the workmen, for ingots and pinnos. As for the article of quick&s;ilver, it is wholly engro&s;&s;ed by the crown. Though the mines do not yield a fourth part of what they did formerly, yet from the wealth of the galleons, and the number of wedges and bars of &s;ilver on board, we may conclude, that the trea&s;ure extracted at this day is very con&s;ide|rable, and would be more &s;o, were the Spaniards as &s;kilful in metallurgy as &s;ome other nations. From the year 1545, when the mines were fir&s;t di&s;covered, to 1574, the king's fifth is &s;aid to have amounted to &s;eventy-&s;ix millions of pe&s;os, or pieces of eight.</P>
<P>The di&s;covery of the mines is &s;aid to have been owing to the following accident: An Indian, called Hualpa, pur&s;uing &s;ome wild goats up the moun|tains, and coming to a &s;teep place, laid hold of a &s;hrub to a&s;&s;i&s;t his a&s;cent, which yielding to his weight, came up by the roots, and di&s;clo&s;ed a ma&s;s of &s;ilver. At the &s;ame time he ob&s;erved large lumps of the metal in the earth, which ad|hered to the roots of the plant. With the fir&s;t fruits of his di&s;covery, the Indian, who lived at Porco, about twenty miles from Poto&s;i, ha&s;tened home, wa&s;hed the &s;ilver, and made u&s;e of it, re+pairing,
<PB N="403" REF="4040">
when his &s;tock was exhau&s;ted, to the mountain for a new &s;upply. In cour&s;e of time, an intimate friend of his ob&s;erving the extraor|dinary change in his circum&s;tances, was de&s;irous of knowing the cau&s;e; and urging him clo&s;ely upon this head, obtained an ample di&s;covery of the whole &s;ecret. For &s;ome time they maintained a kind of partner&s;hip; but Hualpa refu&s;ing to di&s;clo&s;e his method of purifying the metal, &s;o of|fended his comrade, that he immediately revealed the whole to his ma&s;ter Villareal, a Spaniard, who lived at Porco.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the &s;ilver mines near Poto&s;i, there are many others in the audience, e&s;pecially towards Chili. There are al&s;o &s;ome of gold.</P>
<P>La Paz is a con&s;iderable town, &s;ituated near the &s;pring-head of a river, about two hundred and twenty miles from La Plata to the north-we&s;t; and one hundred and twenty-five from the &s;ea-coa&s;t to the ea&s;t. The mountains of the adjacent coun|try are &s;aid to abound in gold, and the plains and vallies in grain, fruit trees, and fields of maiz. About thirty miles to the north-we&s;t of this town lies the lake of Titicaca, which is &s;aid to be eighty miles in circumference, and to have a communi|cation with the lake of Paria, di&s;tant above one hundred and twenty miles to the &s;outh, and almo&s;t as large.</P>
<P>Atacoma is a &s;mall place, forty leagues up the country from Cobija, a village on the coa&s;t, where there is a &s;mall creek or harbour. Atacoma gives name to a de&s;ert of great extent, and very wild and hideous, lying between it and Copiapo in Chili.</P>
<P>Arica &s;tands on the &s;ea-coa&s;t, near three hundred miles from Poto&s;i, and has a good harbour, but contains only about one hundred and fifty families. Formerly mo&s;t of the &s;ilver of Poto&s;i was &s;hipped here for Lima, but now it is chiefly &s;ent by land

as the &s;afe&s;t, though mo&s;t expen&s;ive conveyance. Agi, or Guinea pepper, is much cultivated near this town.</P>
<P>Ylo is a &s;mall port, at the mouth of a river, in the 18th degree of &s;outh lat.</P>
<P>Santa Cruz de la Sierra, or the Holy Cro&s;s of the Mountain, is the capital of a little province, &s;ituated about fifty-five miles from La Plata to the north ea&s;t.</P>
<P>The coa&s;t of Peru, in South America, was fir&s;t di&s;covered by &s;ome &s;hips &s;ent from Panama, by Va&s;co Numes de Bilboa, in the year 1514. They returned to him with an account of the riches that country afforded: but Va&s;co being recalled &s;oon after, and put to death, it was no more thought of, till Francis Pizarro, after taking a view of it him&s;elf, went over to Spain, and procured a com|mi&s;&s;ion from the Emperor Charles V. to impower him, and two other adventurers, to make a con|que&s;t of it, and &s;hare the profits; whereupon Pizarro rai&s;ed a body of forces, and &s;et &s;ail for America, where he arrived in 1530, at Nombre de Dios in Terra-Firma. Having marched his forces over land to Panama, he embarked them there again, and landing in Peru, found the Peruvi|ans engaged in a civil war, one party defending their lawful Prince, and the other headed by an u&s;urper, or pretender to his throne.</P>
<P>Pizarro, joining the malecontents, made him|&s;elf ma&s;ter of a town called Tumbez, where he found a prodigious trea&s;ure; after that he fell up|on the emperor, or inca, though he had &s;ent him an emba&s;&s;y, offering to &s;ubmit him&s;elf and his country to the dominion of the Spaniards, defeat|ed him, made him pri&s;oner, and not long after put him to death. Then Pizarro having received a reinforcement from Spain under Almagro, an|other of the adventurers, marched to Cu&s;co, the
<PB N="405" REF="4060">
capital, which he took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of in October, 1532, and on the 6th of January, 1533, he laid the foundation of Lima.</P>
<P>The emperor Charles V. being informed of the&s;e conque&s;ts, granted Pizarro the viceroy&s;hip of all that part of Peru, extending from the equator four hun|dred leagues to the &s;outhward; and to Almagro he granted all the country two hundred leagues farther &s;outh. Whereupon Almagro marched to the &s;outh|ward, and invaded Chili, after he had, with great difficulty, pa&s;&s;ed the Andes, on which he lo&s;t mo&s;t of his men. Having made &s;ome progre&s;s in the conque&s;t of Chili, upon hearing that Pizarro had made his brother governor of Cu&s;co, and in|tended to di&s;pute his right to that capital, he re|turned to Peru, over the de&s;ert by the &s;ea-&s;ide, which extended two hundred leagues, by which march his men &s;uffered as much by the heat and want of water, as they had done in the moun|tains by the cold: however, he at length arrived at Cu&s;co, and made Ferdinando Pizarro, the go|vernor, pri&s;oner. Thus began a civil war between Almagro and Francis Pizarro, which continued &s;ome time with various &s;ucce&s;s; but at length Al|magro was defeated, taken pri&s;oner, and put to death by the Pizarro's.</P>
<P>And now the viceroy Pizarro being &s;olely po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed of the empire of Peru, extended his con|que&s;ts farther &s;outh, &s;ending the famous Baldivia to penetrate farther into Chili; and about the &s;ame time di&s;covered the &s;ilver mines of La Plata and Poto&s;i.</P>
<P>In the mean time the viceroy continuing to op|pre&s;s the Almagrians, young Almagro, the natu|ral &s;on of the conqueror, formed a party again&s;t him, and killed him in his palace at Lima: after which the young Almagro was proclaimed viceroy of Peru, on the 26th of June, 1540; but Vacca
<PB N="406" REF="4070">
de Ca&s;tro, a new viceroy, arriving from Europe, defeated Almagro, took him pri&s;oner, and be|headed him.</P>
<P>Gonzalo Pizarro, afterwards u&s;urping the go|vernment, was defeated and put to death by Ga&s;co, the pre&s;ident of Lima, anno 1548. This in&s;urrec|tion being &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, &s;everal commanders were &s;ent upon new conque&s;ts, and particularly Baldivia, to endeavour to compleat the conque&s;t of Chili. Ac|ingly Baldivia entered upon this conque&s;t in 1540, and founded the capital city of St. Jago in 1541. He afterwards built the town of Coquimbo, or Se|rena; but the civil wars breaking out again in Peru, he was obliged to return thither, leaving the command of his forces to Franci&s;co Villagra, his lieutenant, from whom the Chili&s;ians recovered great part of their country again; and it was with difficulty that Villagra defended him&s;elf in St. Jago. Baldivia returning to Chili with a &s;trong reinforce|ment of troops, relieved his lieutenant, who was be&s;ieged in St. Jago, recovered the country he had lo&s;t, and built the town of Conception, Baldivia, and Imperial; but tyrannizing over the Chili&s;ians, it occa&s;ioned a general revolt, in which Baldivia was taken pri&s;oner, and put to death by pouring melted gold down his throat. Mo&s;t of the towns he had built were taken, and the Spaniards, in a manner, driven out of Chili: however, they re|covered the towns near the &s;ea-coa&s;t. The Dutch endeavoured to &s;ettle colonies on this coa&s;t in the year 1643, but could not effect it. In the year 1670, Sir John Narborough was &s;ent by king Charles II. to take a view of the coa&s;t of Chili; but on the report he made of his voyage, it was not thought advi&s;eable to attempt to make any &s;ettlement on that &s;ide. There is a clu&s;ter of i&s;lands called the Gallipagos, lying four hundred miles we&s;t of Peru, under the equator.</P>

<HEAD>TUCUMAN.</HEAD>
<P>Although the Spaniards po&s;&s;e&s;s only a few cities, in the exten&s;ive province of Tucuman, they have neverthele&s;s the dominion of the whole. Ulloa ex|pre&s;ly calls it a government within the juri&s;diction of Los Charcas; but neither he, nor any other writer, a&s;certains its exact limits, or de&s;cribes the country with any degree of accuracy. It lies to the we&s;tward of Paraguay, and &s;outh of the river of Plate; but where it begins or ends we cannot preci&s;ely determine. According to the late&s;t geo|graphers, it does not extend beyond the 37&deg;. of &s;outh latitude. Ulloa &s;ays it reaches from north to &s;outh, above one hundred leagues. The cities po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the Spaniards, are St. Jago del E&s;tero, &s;o called from a river on which it is &s;ituated, who&s;e inundations greatly contribute to fertilize the adja|cent land, St. Miguel del Tucuman, Neu&s;tra Senno|ra de Talavara, Cordova de la Nueva, Andalu&s;ia, Rioja, and the large village of San Salvador. The two fir&s;t of the&s;e are the mo&s;t con&s;iderable; the two la&s;t are &s;mall, and built without order or &s;ymmetry. The chief de&s;ign of the court of Madrid in maintain|ing &s;ettlements here, is to &s;ecure a communication between the colonies on the South and North Seas; for the commodities of the country of them&s;elves would hardly reimbur&s;e the expence of keeping garri&s;ons: they con&s;i&s;t chiefly in honey, wax, &s;ugar, wine, cotton, woollen &s;tuffs manufactured by the natives; and mules, much admired for their &s;trength and agility, on which account, great numbers of them are exported to the other pro|vinces of South America.</P>

<HEAD>PARAGUAY.</HEAD>
<P>Paraguay, or La Plata, is bounded by the country of the Amazons on the north; by Bra|zil on the ea&s;t; by Patagonia on the &s;outh; and by Peru and Chili on the we&s;t; extending, it is &s;aid, fifteen hundred miles in length, from north to &s;outh, and almo&s;t as much in breadth. It takes the names of Paraguay and La Plata, from the rivers &s;o called. The land, generally &s;peaking, is very rich and fruitful, producing plenty of wheat, and other European grain, rice, Indian corn, &s;ugar|canes, &s;ome vines, and whole woods of peaches, almonds, figs, &amp;c. together with cotton, indigo, pimento, ipecacuanha, a great variety of other drugs and herbs; among which is that called Paraguay, which probably gives name to the river, and is an excellent emetic, u&s;ed not only by the Indians, but by the Spaniards and Portugue&s;e, all over Peru, Chili, and Brazil. As this is the only country where it is produced, the demand for it is &s;o great, that it would &s;uffice alone to form a very flouri&s;h|ing trade, were there no other article of commerce; but, be&s;ides the abovementioned, here are al&s;o va&s;t herds of cattle, with hor&s;es, mules, &s;heep, and goats, hogs wild and tame, and plenty of fi&s;h, fowls, and veni&s;on. The Portugue&s;e and Spaniards kill great numbers of the cattle merely for their hides and tallow. There is a kind of boars, who&s;e navel is &s;aid to grow upon their backs, and who&s;e fle&s;h is not only very whole&s;ome and nouri&s;hing, but of a mo&s;t delicate ta&s;te. Of wild bea&s;ts, here are ba|boons very tall and &s;trong, lions, tygers, leopards, foxes &amp;c. &s;ome of the &s;nakes are &s;aid to be of a mon&s;trous &s;ize, namely twenty or thirty feet in length, and &s;everal feet round. The rivers breed great numbers of alligators and crocodiles, which
<PB N="409" REF="4100">
are &s;aid to be harmle&s;s, and very good to eat, e&s;pecially roa&s;ted. Mines not only of iron and cop|per, but of gold, &s;ilver, and the fine&s;t amethy&s;ts, we are told, have been di&s;covered in this country; but whether any of them are wrought, we cannot &s;ay.</P>
<P>To the we&s;t of the great river Paraguay, are va&s;t plains, extending &s;ome hundred miles, with very little wood upon them, and &s;carce a hill to be &s;een; but in that part of the country which lies to the ea&s;t of the river, and is divided from Brazil by a ridge of mountains, where the Je&s;uits are &s;aid to have erected a temporal and &s;piritual monarchy, there is a variety of hills and valleys, woods, and plains: this part of the country is al&s;o well culti|vated. Whether the Je&s;uits &s;till maintain their authority here, &s;ince their expul&s;ion from the domi|nions of Spain and Portugal, we cannot po&s;itively &s;ay. But this much is certain, that, before that happened, they not only refu&s;ed to &s;ubmit to the edicts of tho&s;e powers, but even oppo&s;ed their troops in the field; which, among other cau&s;es, mu&s;t undoubtedly have contributed not a little to their expul&s;ion.</P>
<P>The chief river of this country is the Paraguay, from which it takes its name; and which, after i&s;&s;uing from the Laguna de Los Xarayes, in 15&deg;. &s;outh latitude, it runs through it from north to &s;outh, and is joined by &s;everal other rivers. A|bout the 28&deg;. it is joined by the Paranas, and about the 30&deg;. by the Uragua, a large river, and, near Buenos Ayres, by the river of Plate, which ri&s;es in Peru, and after its junction gives name to the river, till it falls into the Atlantic Ocean, fifty leagues below Buenos Ayres. There are al&s;o many lakes in Paraguay, the chief of which are the Xaraya, Caracoraes, and Venoras.</P>
<P>The climate of Paraguay is very little different from that of Spain; and the di&s;tinctions between

the &s;ea&s;ons much the &s;ame. In winter, indeed, violent tempe&s;ts of wind and rain are very frequent, accompanied with &s;uch dreadful claps of thunder and lightning, as fill the inhabitants, though u&s;ed to them, with terror and con&s;ternation. In &s;um|mer, the exce&s;&s;ive heats are mitigated by gentle breezes, which con&s;tantly begin at eight or nine in the morning. In &s;hort, for the enjoyment of life, e&s;pecially with regard to the &s;alubrity of the air, a finer country cannot be imagined.</P>

<P>Almo&s;t every fore&s;t of this country abounds with bees, which make their hives in the hollow of trees. There are here ten different &s;pecies of the&s;e u&s;eful in&s;ects. That mo&s;t e&s;teemed for the white|ne&s;s of its wax, and the delicacy of its honey, is called opemus, but is very &s;carce.

<P>Be&s;ides maiz, manioc, and potatoes, which thrive very well in &s;everal places, and in which the food of tho&s;e Indians who cultivate the earth chiefly con&s;i&s;ts, there are in this country many fruits and &s;imples not known in Europe. In par|ticular, there are &s;ome fruits, of which the Spani|ards make excellent &s;weetmeats. Some have plant|ed vines, which do not thrive equally well in every di&s;trict. Wheat has been &s;own in &s;ome places; but it is &s;eldom made u&s;e of but for cakes, and other things of that kind. There are every where venomous herbs, with which &s;ome Indians poi&s;on their arrows; but the antidotes are equally com|mon; and among others, the herb called Sparrows herb, which forms pretty large bu&s;hes, and was di&s;covered, and obtained its name, in the following manner.</P>
<P><PB N="411" REF="4120">
Among the different kinds of &s;parrows found in the&s;e provinces, mo&s;t of which are of the &s;ize of our black-birds, there is a very pretty one called Macagua. This little creature is very fond of the fle&s;h of vipers, again&s;t whom, for this rea&s;on, he wages a continual war. As &s;oon, therefore, as he &s;pies one of the&s;e reptiles, he whips his head under his wing, and gathers him&s;elf up into a round ball, without the lea&s;t appearance of life or motion; he does not, however, cover his eyes &s;o entirely, but that he may peep through the feathers of his wing, and ob&s;erve the motions of his game, which he &s;uffers to approach without &s;tirring, until he finds it near enough to receive a &s;troke of his bill, which he then &s;uddenly di&s;charges at it. The viper im|mediately returns the compliment with another of his tongue, but the minute the &s;parrow finds him|&s;elf wounded, he flies to his herb, eats &s;ome of it, and is in&s;tantly cured. He then returns to the charge, and has recour&s;e to his herb every time the viper &s;tings him. This conflict la&s;ts till the viper, de&s;titute of the &s;ame re&s;ource, has lo&s;t all his blood; as &s;oon as the reptile is dead, the &s;parrow falls to work upon the carca&s;e, and concludes the fea&s;t with a new do&s;e of his antidote.</P>
<P>There are few countries which breed &s;o great a number, and &s;o many different &s;pecies of &s;erpents and &s;uch other reptiles; but there are a great many of them no way poi&s;onous, or who&s;e poi&s;on is any way dangerous. The Indians know the&s;e innocent though frightful reptiles, take them up alive in their hands, and make girdles of them, without any bad con&s;equence. There are &s;ome of the&s;e creatures twenty-two feet long, and proportionably thick, that &s;wallow whole &s;tags, if we may believe the Spaniards, who a&s;&s;ure us they have been eye|witne&s;&s;es to their feats this way. The Indians &s;ay, that the&s;e mon&s;ters engender at the mouth, that

the young ones tear their way into the world through the &s;ides of their mothers, after which the &s;tronge&s;t devours the weake&s;t. And were it not for this di&s;po&s;ition of Providence, Father Anthony Ruiz de Montoya, who &s;eems to credit this account, ob&s;erves, that it would be impo&s;&s;ible to &s;tir out of doors, without meeting with the&s;e terrible animals. Among tho&s;e who are oviparous, there are &s;ome which lay very large eggs, and make u&s;e of in|cubation to hatch them.</P>
<P>The rattle-&s;nake, &s;o common in &s;everal provinces of North-America, is no where more &s;o than in Pa|raguay. It has been ob&s;erved in this country, that this reptile &s;uffers greatly when its gums are too much di&s;tended with venom; and that, to get rid of this venom, it falls upon every thing in its way with two crooked fangs, pretty large at their roots, but terminating in a point, and, by means of a hol|low in the&s;e fangs, pours into the wound it makes all the humour that tormented it. The effects of the bite of this and many other kinds of &s;erpents is very &s;udden; &s;ometimes the blood i&s;&s;ues vio|lently at the eyes, no&s;e, ears, gums, and roots of the nails; but there are antidotes to be found every where again&s;t this poi&s;on. The mo&s;t &s;ucce&s;sful are, a &s;tone to which they have given the name of St. Paul, bezoard, and a poultice of chewed gar|lick. The very head of the animal, and its liver, which is likewi&s;e eaten to purify the blood, are equally efficacious. The &s;ure&s;t method, however, is to begin by making an inci&s;ion directly in the part that has been &s;tung, and then apply brim&s;tone to it; nay, this drug alone has been often found to make a perfect cure.</P>
<P>There are here, likewi&s;e, &s;ome hunting &s;erpents, which climb up the trees to di&s;cover their prey, and from thence dart upon it when within reach, &s;queeze it &s;o tight that it cannot &s;tir, and then de|vour
<PB N="413" REF="4140">
it alive at their lei&s;ure. But when they have eat up whole carca&s;es, they become &s;o heavy that they cannot move; and, as they have not &s;ome|times a &s;ufficient degree of natural heat to dige&s;t &s;uch enormous meals, would inevitably become the victims of their own voracity, did not nature &s;ugge&s;t to them a remedy, which rea&s;on certainly would never permit them to employ. On this oc|ca&s;ion, the mon&s;ter turns up his belly to the &s;un, who&s;e heat makes it putrify; the worms then breed in it, and the birds coming to their a&s;&s;i&s;tance, feed upon a &s;uperfluity, which otherwi&s;e would mo&s;t certainly kill him: the patient takes care not to let the birds go too great lengths, and, in a &s;hort time after this extraordinary operation, finds him&s;elf as well as ever. But it often happens, they &s;ay, that the &s;kin of the &s;erpent clo&s;es upon the branches of trees, upon which he has been in too great ha&s;te to &s;tation him&s;elf; this is a &s;crape, out of which he mu&s;t find it a much more difficult matter to extri|cate him&s;elf than the former.</P>
<P>Many of the&s;e reptiles live upon fi&s;h; and Fa|ther Montoya, from whom I have taken almo&s;t all the&s;e particulars, informs us, that he happened one day to e&s;py a huge &s;nake, who&s;e head was as big as a calf's, fi&s;hing on the banks of a river. The fir&s;t thing that the mon&s;ter did was to di&s;charge by its mouth a great quantity of foam into the river; he then thru&s;t his head into the water, and kept it very quiet, till a great many &s;mall fi&s;hes, attracted by the foam, had gathered about it; when, &s;uddenly opening his jaws, he laid about him, and &s;wallowed the fi&s;h in great numbers. Another time, the &s;ame author a&s;&s;ures us, he &s;aw an Indian of the talle&s;t &s;tature, who happened to be fi&s;hing up to his mid|dle in water, &s;wallowed alive by a huge &s;nake, which the next day vomited his prey a&s;hore, quite whole, all to the bones, which were cru&s;hed to
<PB N="414" REF="4150">
pieces, as if they had been brui&s;ed between two mill-&s;tones. This mon&s;trous &s;pecies of reptiles never quit the water; and in the rapids, which are pretty common in the Parana, they are often &s;een &s;wimming with a huge tail, and their head, which is likewi&s;e very large, above water. The In|dians &s;ay, that they engender in the &s;ame manner as land animals; and that the males often attack women, as it is pretended monkeys do in &s;ome countries. One thing, however, is certain, and that is, that Father Montoya was one day called upon to hear the confe&s;&s;ion of an Indian woman, whom, while &s;he was wa&s;hing &s;ome linen on the banks of a river, one of the&s;e animals attacked, and, as &s;he &s;aid, offered violence to her. The mi&s;|&s;ionary found her &s;tretched upon the &s;pot, where &s;he &s;aid the thing had happened: &s;he told him, "She was &s;ure &s;he had but a few minutes to live;" and, in fact, expired almo&s;t as &s;oon as &s;he had fini&s;hed her confe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Paraguay was fir&s;t di&s;covered by Seba&s;tian Ga|boto, who pa&s;&s;ed from Rio de la Plata, in 1526, to the river Parana, in &s;mall barks, and thence entered the river called Paraguay. Don Pedro de Men|doza, the fir&s;t governor of Buenos-Ayres, gave Juan de Ayolos a commi&s;&s;ion, and a body of forces, to complete the reduction of it; but it was the Je|&s;uits who fir&s;t brought a con&s;iderable part of it in|to actual obedience. Soon after Juan de Sobras had founded the city called Nue&s;tra Senora de la A&s;&s;umption, a few Je&s;uits went to Paraguay, pro|perly &s;o called, and converted about fifty Indian families; who &s;oon induced many others to follow their example, on account of the peace and tran|quility they enjoyed under the direction of the fathers. They had long di&s;dained to &s;ubmit to the arms of the Portugue&s;e and Spaniards; but the Je|&s;uits, by learning their language, conforming to
<PB N="415" REF="4160">
their manners, cultivating their minds, and incul|cating &s;uch doctrines as were mo&s;t likely to pro|mote their views, &s;oon acquired great authority among them, and made numerous converts, till at la&s;t, by &s;teadily pur&s;uing the &s;ame artful mea&s;ures, they arrived at that degree of power and influence they now or lately po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, as being in a manner the ab&s;olute &s;overeigns of a great part of this ex|ten&s;ive country; for above three hundred and fifty thou&s;and families are &s;aid to have been &s;ubject to the fathers, living in an obedience and awe border|ing upon adoration; yet procured without any vio|lence, or con&s;traint. There were above three&s;core pari&s;hes on the banks of the rivers Paraguay and Parana, not exceeding the di&s;tance of thirty miles from each other: in each of the&s;e there was a Je|&s;uit, &s;upreme in all cau&s;es, civil, military, and ec|cle&s;ia&s;tic, who might be regarded as a petty prince, governing not only with the &s;way of a &s;overeign, but with the influence and reputation of an oracle. He nominated the chiefs in all the different de|partments; the cacique held of him; the general received his commi&s;&s;ion and in&s;tructions from him; and all his deci&s;ions were without appeal. The &s;ame reverend father who pre&s;ided over the civil oeconomy, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by two others, performed al&s;o all the duties of a pari&s;h-prie&s;t; catechi&s;ing the In|dians, &s;aying ma&s;s, exhorting, marrying, confe&s;|&s;ing, impo&s;ing penance, vi&s;iting the &s;ick, and chaunting in the churches, which are very neat and elegant. Such was the idea conveyed of the beha|viour of the&s;e fathers by the writers of their or|der, particularly the celebrated Muratori: fame, however, treated their characters with more &s;everi|ty, and accu&s;ed them of pride and haughtine&s;s, in carrying their authority to an exce&s;s, &s;o far as to cau&s;e even the magi&s;trates to be corrected before them with &s;tripes, while they &s;uffered per&s;ons of
<PB N="416" REF="4170">
the highe&s;t di&s;tinction, within their juri&s;diction, to ki&s;s the hems of their garments, as the greate&s;t ho|nour to which they could po&s;&s;ibly arrive. To this might be added, the utter abolition of all ideas of property, which indeed was rendered u&s;ele&s;s, by the general magazines and &s;torehou&s;es which they e&s;tabli&s;hed, and from which, and the herds of cat|tle kept for the public u&s;e, they &s;upplied the wants of individuals, as occa&s;ion required; yet it reflected on the character of the fraternity, that they po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed large property them&s;elves, and claimed the ab&s;olute di&s;po&s;al of the meane&s;t effects in Para|guay. All manufactures were theirs; every natu|ral commodity was brought to them; and the trea&s;ures remitted yearly to the &s;uperior of the or|der were a proof, that zeal for religion was not the only motive that induced the reverend fathers to encounter &s;o many difficulties, and labour &s;o inde|fatigably in the&s;e mi&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the parochial or provincial governments, there was a kind of &s;upreme council, compo&s;ed of an annual meeting of all the fathers, who concerted the mea&s;ures nece&s;&s;ary for promoting the common concerns of the mi&s;&s;ion, framed new laws, correct|ed or aboli&s;hed old ones, and adapted every thing el&s;e to circum&s;tances. It is &s;aid to have been one of the great objects of the annual councils, to take &s;uch mea&s;ures as &s;hould effectually deprive &s;trangers of all intelligence concerning the &s;tate of the mi&s;|&s;ion. Hence the natives were re&s;trained from learning the Spani&s;h tongue; and were taught, that it was dangerous to their &s;alvation to hold any intercour&s;e with a &s;ubject of Spain or Portugal. But the circum&s;tance that rendered their de&s;igns mo&s;t liable to &s;u&s;picion was, the e&s;tabli&s;hment of a military force: every pari&s;h had its corps of hor&s;e and foot, who were duly exerci&s;ed every Sunday; and it was &s;aid, the whole amounted to a body of
<PB N="417" REF="4180">
&s;eventy or eighty thou&s;and well-di&s;ciplined troops, amazingly expert in the u&s;e of firelocks and bay|onets, and al&s;o of &s;lings, with which they threw &s;tones of four or five pounds weight, with a&s;toni&s;h|ing force and dexterity.</P>
<P>Such was the &s;tate of this country &s;ome years ago. As to its pre&s;ent &s;ituation, we can advance nothing po&s;itively, for want of authentic intelli|gence.</P>
<P>The natives of Paraguay are of a moderate &s;tature, and well proportioned, their faces flat, and rather round than oval, their complexion olive; and they have long black hair, as &s;trong as hor&s;ehair: they formerly wore the &s;kin of &s;ome bea&s;t over their &s;houlders, as a mantle, and another about the wai&s;t, but now conform to the Spani&s;h fa&s;hions. They are a brave people, but lazy and indolent, and dull at invention; but imitate almo&s;t any thing, and are become excellent mechanics, &s;ince the Europeans furni&s;hed them with patterns.</P>
<P>Formerly they wor&s;hipped the &s;un, moon and &s;tars, thunder and lightning, groves, rivers, and animals, and allowed of polygamy and concu|binage; &s;o that the greate&s;t objection they had at fir&s;t to Chri&s;tianity was, that one man was con|fined by it to one woman. It is &s;aid, when a young Indian woman &s;aw a fellow &s;he liked, &s;he u&s;ed to acquaint the mi&s;&s;ionary with it, who &s;ent for the man and propo&s;ed the matter to him; if he ap|proved of it, the match was made, and the prie&s;t gave them his ble&s;&s;ing. Some of the unconverted tribes are &s;aid to fatten the pri&s;oners they make, and to fea&s;t on them. Dead bodies among &s;ome are laid up in great pots, which, from a notion that the &s;ouls are buried with them, they take care to cover with hollow or concave lids, to pre|vent their being &s;tifled. The wives of the caciques, or petty princes, wear a kind of triple crown made
<PB N="418" REF="4190">
of &s;traw, and their lords hang doe-&s;kins over their &s;houlders; the re&s;t wear only a piece wrapped round their middle, and hanging down to their knees. The boys and girls go quite naked. They wrap up their infants as &s;oon as born in a tiger's &s;kin, and give them the brea&s;t for a little while, and then a piece of half raw meat to &s;uck. At the death of a near relation the men cut off a finger of their left hand, in token of mourning; and if it be a hand&s;ome daughter, they make a great fea&s;t and drink out of her &s;kull. Their beds are the hides of oxen, or tygers, &s;pread on the ground; but the people of rank u&s;e hammocks of net|work.</P>
<P>The above-mentioned Father Charlevoix thus characterizes the &s;avages of Paraguay. The na|tives in general, but e&s;pecially the Chacone&s;e, and the Guaranis, are of an advantageous &s;tature; and there have been found men among them above &s;even feet high. Their features differ greatly from ours; and the colours, with which they paint them|&s;elves, give them &s;uch an a&s;pect, that &s;trangers can|not, at fir&s;t &s;ight, help being terrified a little. And, accordingly, they pretend by this means to &s;trike a terror into their enemies. A Spani&s;h captain, who had &s;erved with reputation in Europe, having been commanded again&s;t &s;ome Indians of Chaco, that lived pretty near Santa Fe, was &s;o thunder|&s;truck with their appearance, that he fainted away. Mo&s;t of the men go quite naked, all to a parcel of feathers, of different colours, hanging to a &s;tring about their wai&s;t. But at their public &s;olemnities, they wear caps made of the &s;ame feathers. In very cold weather, they wrap them&s;elves up in a kind of cap and cloak, made of &s;kins pretty well dre&s;&s;ed, and adorned with painted figures. Among &s;ome nations the women are not better covered than the men. The bad qualities common to all the&s;e
<PB N="419" REF="4200">
people, are ferocity, incon&s;tancy, perfidy, and drunkenne&s;s. They are all &s;prightly, though very dull of apprehen&s;ion in every thing that does not fall immediately under the &s;en&s;es. There is, pro|perly &s;peaking, no form of government among them; every town indeed has its cacique; but the&s;e chiefs have no authority, but in proportion to the e&s;teem they have acquired. Several do nothing but rove from place to place with their furniture, which con&s;i&s;ts of nothing but a mat, a hammock, and a calaba&s;h. The cabins of tho&s;e who live in towns, are, among &s;everal nations, no better than wretched hovels made with branches of trees, and covered with &s;traw, or rather gra&s;s. Tho&s;e who live neare&s;t to Tucuman, are, it &s;eems, better lodged and better cloathed.</P>
<P>Their favourite liquor is chica, of which I have already made mention. They a&s;&s;emble to drink it, and to dance and &s;ing; and in the&s;e exerci&s;es they per&s;i&s;t till they are all drunk. They then quarrel, and from words &s;oon proceed to blows; &s;o that their merry-makings &s;eldom terminate without blood&s;hed, if not in the death of &s;ome of the gue&s;ts. Several take advantage of the confu&s;ion to be revenged on their enemies. The&s;e exerci&s;es are almo&s;t peculiar to the men. The women gene|rally withdraw, the moment they perceive the liquor begins to get the better of the men, and carry off with them all the arms they can lay their hands upon. A &s;mall matter is &s;ufficient to breed a war between the&s;e nations; but their unconquerable inveteracy again&s;t the Spaniards ea&s;ily unites them again, on the fir&s;t alarm from that quarter.</P>
<P>Almo&s;t all the&s;e Indians are anthropophagites, or man-eaters, and have no other occupation but war and pillage, which they exerci&s;e with &s;uch craft and ob&s;tinacy, that they have rendered them&s;elves formidable to their neighbours, particularly the
<PB N="420" REF="4210">
Spaniards, who do not chu&s;e to engage them, even when &s;urprized, with equal arms; their courage, in that ca&s;e, changing to fury. Nay, many of their women have been known on &s;uch occa&s;ions, to &s;ell their lives at a very dear rate, rather than &s;urrender to the be&s;t armed &s;oldiers. When they have re|&s;olved to plunder a country-&s;eat, or village, there is no art they do not practice to lull the inhabitants into a fatal &s;ecurity, or get out of their way, when they have &s;truck their blow. They will watch for whole years, the opportunity of &s;urprizing them, without running any ri&s;k. For this purpo&s;e, they have &s;pies abroad, who never march but by night; when they make nothing of crawling along, if re|qui&s;ite, on their elbows, which, for this rea&s;on, are always covered with a callus. Some Spaniards have been weak enough to think, that the&s;e &s;pies, by &s;ome magic power, a&s;umed the forms of do|me&s;tic animals, in order to examine what was doing in their hou&s;es.</P>
<P>Their arms are bows and arrows, and the manca|na, a kind of lance or javelin, made of a very hard, and very heavy wood, pretty thick, fifteen palms long, and terminating in a deer's horn, with a beard to it. This weapon they u&s;e with great &s;trength and dexterity; and by means of a rope, to which it is fa&s;tened, draw in the man it has wounded unle&s;s he had re&s;olution enough to pull it out They generally &s;aw the necks of their pri&s;oner with the jaw-bone of a fi&s;h, and then pull off hi &s;calp, which they pre&s;erve as a monument of their victory, and di&s;play in all their entertainments.</P>
<P>They are &s;uch bold and able hor&s;emen, that the Spaniards will repent but once, their having &s;o we &s;tocked with hor&s;es all the&s;e parts of the continent Swift as the&s;e animals are, the Indians of Chac$ &s;top them in full &s;peed, and vault upon them, $$ matter whether &s;ideways or from behind, without
<PB N="421" REF="4220">
any a&s;&s;i&s;tance but that of their javelins, upon which they &s;pring. They then, without &s;tirrups or bri|dles, without any thing in &s;hort but a halter, not only keep their &s;eat, but turn the proud animal which way they plea&s;e, and make him fly at &s;uch a rate, as to leave behind them the be&s;t mounted Spaniards. As mo&s;t of them go always naked, their &s;kin is very hard. Father Locano a&s;&s;ures us, he has &s;een the head of a Mocovi, the &s;kin of which was half an inch thick.</P>
<P>The women of Chaco prick their faces, brea&s;ts, and arms, like the Moori&s;h women of Africa and Spain; they are very robu&s;t, bring forth with great ea&s;e, and, as &s;oon as delivered, bathe them&s;elves and children in the next lake or river. They are treated by their hu&s;bands with great &s;everity, becau&s;e per|haps, they are very much addicted to jealou&s;y, and have no manner of tenderne&s;s for their children. They bury their dead on the very &s;pot where they expire; and plant a javelin over the grave, fa&s;ten|ing to it the &s;kull of an enemy, e&s;pecially of a Spaniard, if they can get one. They then remove from the place, and even avoid pa&s;&s;ing it, till the decea&s;ed is totally forgotten.</P>
<P>The inhabitants of Paraguay, upon the Ea&s;tern Guayra, at the fir&s;t arrival of the Spaniards in that part of America, lived in towns that were pretty populous, and the caciques of which, by being hereditary and independent of one another, had a great deal of authority over their &s;ubjects. Sometimes, however, as it happens in all nations more addicted to the arts of war than tho&s;e of peace, private per&s;ons acquired this rank by their valour; and not &s;eldom by a &s;ingular facility in &s;peaking well the language of the country, which, according to Father Montoya, who was a perfect ma&s;ter of it, yields in nothing to any of the fine&s;t we are acquainted with. The chief prerogatives
<PB N="422" REF="4230">
enjoyed by the caciques, con&s;i&s;ted in a right to the labour of their &s;ubjects, for the purpo&s;es of agricul|ture; and the u&s;e of their daughters, when they required it.</P>
<P>At the death of a cacique, it was lawful for one of his brothers to marry the widow; but this &s;el|dom happened. In general, the&s;e Indians did not approve of &s;uch marriages between near relations; and the men among them, who have embraced the Chri&s;tian religion, never marry any of their rela|tions, even within tho&s;e degrees with which the church readily di&s;pen&s;es. But the caciques could have more wives than one. As to their religion, they acknowledged but one God; for if they ex|pre&s;&s;ed any veneration for the bones of their jug|glers, whom they had &s;een perform &s;uch things in their life-time, as, in their opinion, &s;urpa&s;&s;ed the &s;trength of nature, they by no means con&s;idered them as divinities, though the &s;pecies of wor&s;hip they paid them differed but little from that which other nations pay their idols. They never, howe|ver, offered any &s;acrifices to God; nor could any regular form of wor&s;hip be di&s;covered among them.</P>
<P>They reckoned their years by winters; but &s;el|dom went beyond ten, without making a mi&s;take. They judged of its being time to ri&s;e, when the Pleiades began to make their appearance above the horizon. They imagined there was a tiger and a great dog in the heavens, which devoured the &s;un and the moon, as often as the&s;e luminaries hap|pened to be eclip&s;ed; and the&s;e events greatly alarmed them. The hu&s;bands, on their wives be|ing brought to bed, ob&s;erved a rigorous fa&s;t; and neither hunted nor conver&s;ed with any one during that time, firmly believing, that the child's life de|pended on their punctually complying with this cu&s;tom. They u&s;ed a kind of bapti&s;m; but au|thors
<PB N="223" REF="4240">
do not give us any &s;atisfactory account of it. But the ceremonies they ob&s;erved in giving names to their new-born children, will be&s;t &s;erve to give us a ju&s;t idea of the &s;avagene&s;s of this nation. Thinking it unlawful to perform the ceremony with|out the death of a pri&s;oner of war, they deferred it, till they could make one. After entertaining him plentifully for &s;everal days, and even giving him his choice of as many young girls, or grown up women as he thought proper, they cut his throat on the day appointed for that purpo&s;e, with great ceremony. As &s;oon as he was dead, every one touched his body, or &s;truck it with a &s;tick; and during this operation they gave names to all the children, that had not as yet received any. This done, the body was cut up, and every family took home a piece of it to make into broth, of which every one took a mouthful, not excepting children at the brea&s;t, whom their mothers took care to make partakers of this helli&s;h repa&s;t.</P>
<P>Their manner of receiving per&s;ons, returned from a long journey, had &s;omething very odd in it. The traveller, on entering his cabbin, im|mediately &s;eated him&s;elf, without uttering a &s;ingle &s;yllable; and, the next moment the women began to walk round and round him, ob&s;erving, all the time, the &s;ame &s;ilence, till at la&s;t they &s;uddenly bur&s;t out into exclamations, which were followed by a long relation of all the di&s;agreeable events that had happened in his family, during his ab|&s;ence; the men, covering their faces, repeated the &s;ame things with a low voice; and this ceremony la&s;ted a longer or &s;horter time in proportion to the e&s;teem they had for the traveller. At la&s;t they all congratulated him on his happy arrival, and enter|tained him in the be&s;t manner they were able.</P>
<P>The women, on the death of their hu&s;bands, u&s;ed to throw them&s;elves from &s;ome eminence, high
<PB N="424" REF="4250">
enough to cripple them&s;elves the remainder of their lives. The Indians believed, that the &s;oul, on its leaving the body, never wandered at any great di&s;|tance from it, but kept it company in the grave, where they, accordingly, left a vacancy for it to re&s;ide in. The fir&s;t who embraced the Go&s;pel, could &s;carce be prevailed on to renounce this prac|tice; and Chri&s;tian women have been pretty often di&s;covered going privately to the graves of their children and hu&s;bands, in order to &s;ift the mould over them, as their &s;ouls, they &s;aid, would be too much burthened without this precaution.</P>
<P>When a girl was old enough to be married, they put her into the hands of a woman, who, for eight days together, employed her in mo&s;t laborious ta&s;ks; fed her very ill, and withal never gave her a moment's re&s;t. By her manner of bearing this trial, they judged if &s;he was laborious, and other|wi&s;e qualified to undertake the care of a family. At the expiration of this term, they cut off her hair, and declared her marriageable. It would have been criminal in a young woman to keep company with a man before &s;he had pa&s;&s;ed through this trial; or, at lea&s;t, &s;he mu&s;t have done it very privately, to e&s;cape puni&s;hment.</P>
<P>The Guaranis placed great faith in certain men, who at once acted the part of fortune-tellers and phy&s;icians, pretending to draw certain information of what was to happen from the &s;inging of birds; and to have received from heaven the power of cur|ing all manner of di&s;ea&s;es. Their whole quackery, however, con&s;i&s;ted in &s;ucking the part affected, and then pretending to extract from it &s;omething, which they had the precaution of taking into their mouths before they went to work; but pro|duced, with the greate&s;t a&s;&s;urance, as the cau&s;e of all the patient's illne&s;s, who&s;e imagination they greatly calmed by this &s;tratagem. This, no doubt,
<PB N="425" REF="4260">
was doing a great deal. Be&s;ides, they never wor|ried their patients with drugs and operations; &s;o that if they did not a&s;&s;i&s;t nature, neither did they ob&s;truct her; and if they did not cure, neither did they kill their patients. The Guaranis had like|wi&s;e their conjurers, who boa&s;ted a power of killing whoever they thought proper; and had, in fact, &s;o far bewitched numbers, as to make them believe that &s;everal had been carried off by the &s;ecret power of their incantations; &s;o that it was &s;ometimes enough for a man to have an enemy, to be &s;eized with a pa|nic, and even die of it, if he had not wherewith to bribe the&s;e impo&s;tors.</P>
<P>Paraguay is divided into &s;everal provinces, which take their names from the rivers that pa&s;s through it, and of which Paraguay and La Plata, proper|ly &s;o called, are the chief. Paraguay contains &s;everal towns, but none of any note be&s;ides A&s;&s;ump|tion, which is &s;ituated in 25&deg;. 11&prime;. according to the late&s;t ob&s;ervations, at the conflux of the rivers Parana and Paraguay, and is a large well built and populous city. It was built by the Spaniards, anno 1538. The territory about it is exceeding rich and fruitful, and the air &s;o temperate, that the trees are cloathed with a con&s;tant delightful verdure.</P>
<P>La Plata &s;ometimes denotes the whole of Para|guay, and &s;ometimes only a part or province of it. In the latter &s;en&s;e it comprehends all that country bounded on the ea&s;t and &s;outh-ea&s;t by the Atlantic Ocean; on the &s;outh by Terra Magellanica; on the we&s;t by Tucuman; and on the north by the provinces of Paraguay Proper, and Parana. It takes its name from the great river La Plata, fir&s;t di&s;covered, in 1515, by Juan Diaz de Solis; but denominated La Plata by Seba&s;tian Gabato, from the great quantity of the precious metals he pro|cured from the adjacent inhabitants, imagining it
<PB N="426" REF="4270">
was the produce of the country, though, in fact, they brought it from Peru.</P>
<P>This country lies between 32 and 37&deg;. of &s;outh latitude. The climate is plea&s;ant and healthy. Their winter is in May, June, and July, when the nights are indeed very cold, but the days moderate|ly warm; the fro&s;t is neither violent nor la&s;ting, and the &s;nows very incon&s;iderable.</P>
<P>The country con&s;i&s;ts mo&s;tly of plains of a va&s;t extent, and exceeding rich &s;oil, producing all &s;orts of European and American fruits, wheat, maiz, cotton, &s;ugar, honey, &amp;c. and abounding with &s;uch excellent pa&s;tures, that the bea&s;ts brought hi|ther from Spain are multiplied to &s;uch a degree, that they are all in common, no man claiming any property in them, but every man takes what he hath occa&s;ion for. The number of black cattle, e&s;pecially, is &s;o prodigious, that many thou&s;ands of them are killed merely for their hides, every time the &s;hips go for Spain, and their carca&s;es left to be devoured by wild bea&s;ts and birds of prey, which are al&s;o very numerous. Sometimes, when they cannot vend their hides, they will kill them for their tongues; and tho&s;e who care not to be at the trouble to fetch them from the plains, may buy them for a trifle. There is a curious account in lord An&s;on's voyage of the manner of hunting them on hor&s;eback; and of catching and killing them, by throwing a noo&s;e on their horns at full gallop, the hor&s;es being trained to the &s;port. Hor&s;es are no le&s;s numerous, and in common, like the other cattle; &s;o that a man may have as many as he plea&s;es for the catching, and of tho&s;e that are already broke, one may buy &s;ome of the be&s;t, and of the true Spani&s;h breed, for a piece of eight per head. Wild-fowl al&s;o is in great plenty here; partridges, in particular, are more numerous, and as large and tame as our hens; &s;o that one may
<PB N="427" REF="4280">
kill them with a &s;tick. Their wheat makes the fine&s;t and white&s;t of bread; and, in a word, they &s;eem to want for nothing here, e&s;pecially the na|tives, but &s;alt and fuel. The former the Spaniards have brought to them from other parts; and the latter they &s;upply them&s;elves with, by planting va&s;t numbers of almond, peach, and other trees, which re|quire no other trouble than putting the kernels into the ground, and by the next year, we are told, they begin to bear fruit. The return for European commodities is &s;o great here, that it almo&s;t exceeds belief; an ordinary two-penny knife fetching a crown, and a gun of the value of ten or twelve &s;hil|lings, twenty or thirty crowns, and &s;o of the re&s;t.</P>
<P>The river of Plate, as we ob&s;erved already, ri&s;es in Peru, and receives a great many others in its cour&s;e, the chief of which is the Paraguay. The water of it is &s;aid to be very clear and &s;weet, and to petrify wood, and contains &s;uch plenty and variety of fi&s;h, that the people catch great quantities of them without any other in&s;trument than their hands. It runs mo&s;tly to the &s;outh and &s;outh-ea&s;t, and is navigable the greater part of its cour&s;e by the large&s;t ve&s;&s;els, and full of delightful i&s;lands. All along its banks are &s;een the mo&s;t beautiful birds of all kinds; but it &s;ometimes overflows the adjacent country to a great extent, and is infe&s;ted by &s;er|pents of a prodigious bigne&s;s. From its junction with the Paraguay to its mouth is above two hun|dred leagues. We may form &s;ome judgment of its largene&s;s by the width of its mouth, which is &s;aid to be about &s;eventy leagues. Before it falls into the Paraguay, it is called Panama.</P>
<P>Nue&s;tra Sennora de Buenos Ayres, the capital of the province, taking its name from the plea&s;antne&s;s of the climate, was founded in 1535, under the di|rection of Pedro de Mendoza, at that time go|vernor. It &s;tands on a point called Cape Blanco,
<PB N="428" REF="4290">
on the &s;outh &s;ide of the Plata, fronting a &s;mall ri|ver, in 34&deg;. 34&prime;. 38&Prime;. of &s;outh latitude, in a fine plain, ri&s;ing by a gentle a&s;cent from the river. Nothing can exceed the temperature of the air, the fertility of the &s;oil, or the beautiful verdure, which over&s;preads the whole face of the country about this city, of which the inhabitants have an uninterrupted pro&s;pect, as far as the eye can reach. Buenos Ayres has &s;treight broad &s;treets, and is of a con&s;iderable extent, containing no le&s;s than three thou&s;and hou&s;es, built mo&s;tly of chalk or brick. Here is a very hand&s;ome &s;quare, with a magnifi|cent cathedral, and a ca&s;tle, in which the governor holds his court, with a garri&s;on of three thou&s;and men. The Spaniards bring hither part of the trea&s;ures of Peru down the river, and &s;hip them for Spain, with va&s;t quantities of hides, and other com|modities of this country. The river is here &s;even leagues in breadth, and navigable by any &s;hip &s;ix|ty leagues above the town, and no farther, by rea|&s;on of a cataract.</P>
<P>Within the government of Buenos Ayres are three other towns, called Monte de Video, Corri|entes, and Santa F&eacute;; but they are not large enough to merit a de&s;cription.</P>

<P>The viceroyalty of Peru extends not only over tho&s;e va&s;t countries within the juri&s;diction of the audiences of Lima and Los Charcos, but tho&s;e al&s;o in the audience of Chili.</P>
<P>Chili, taken in a large &s;en&s;e, reaches from the frontiers of Peru to the Straits of Magellan, the di&s;tance being three hundred and fifty leagues. The&s;e two kingdoms are &s;eparated by the di&s;trict of Atacama, which extends eighty leagues between the province of the &s;ame name, being the la&s;t of Peru,
<PB N="429" REF="4300">
and the Valley of Copayapu, the fir&s;t in Chili. Ea&s;tward, &s;ome parts of this kingdom terminate on the frontiers of Paraguay, properly &s;o called, though &s;ome uninhabited de&s;erts intervene, and others on the government of Buenos Ayres, or La Plata, properly &s;o called; though between the&s;e are the pampas, or wide extended plains. Its we&s;tern boundary is the South-Sea, extending near|ly from 27&deg;. the latitude of Copayapu, to 53&deg;. 30&prime;. &s;outh. But to confine our&s;elves to the true extent of this kingdom, as inhabited by the Spa|niards, it begins at Copayapu, and terminates at the large i&s;land of Chiloe, the &s;outhern extremity of which is in 24&deg;. of &s;outh latitude; and its extent, from we&s;t to ea&s;t, is the di&s;tance between the Cor|dillera, which is here of a &s;tupendous height, and the coa&s;t of the South-Sea.</P>
<P>Chili lying &s;outh of the equator, the &s;ea&s;ons are al|mo&s;t oppo&s;ite to tho&s;e in the northern hemi&s;phere; but the face of the country, except on the &s;ea-coa&s;t, is beautiful, and the climate whole&s;ome. On the ea&s;t, the country is &s;kreened by the Andes; while, from the we&s;t, the air is cooled by the mo&s;t refre&s;hing &s;ea-breezes. Along the coa&s;t of the Pacific Ocean, they enjoy not only a fine temperate air, but a clear &s;erene heaven, mo&s;t part of the year. Sometimes, indeed, the winds that blow from the mountains are exceeding &s;harp in winter; but, in general, this is one of the mo&s;t comfortable climates in the world, being a medium between the inten&s;e heats of the torrid zone and the piercing colds of the frigid.</P>
<P>The Andes, being covered with &s;now great part of the year, &s;upply the country with innumerable rivulets, which greatly contribute to its extraordi|nary fertility. There are many vulcanos among the&s;e mountains, and the air is &s;o &s;harp and &s;ubtle, that they cannot be pa&s;&s;ed without great danger.
<PB N="430" REF="4310">
They run almo&s;t from one end of America to the other, beginning in Terra-Magellanica or Patago|nia, and traver&s;ing the kingdom of Chili, the pro|vince of Buenos Ayres, the empire of Peru, the audience of Quito, the va&s;t region of Terra-Firma; and then, contracting them&s;elves, as it were, for a pa&s;&s;age, at the I&s;thmus of Darien, widen again, and pa&s;s through the provinces and kingdoms of Nica|ragua, Guatimala, Co&s;ta-Rica, Mexico, and others more to the northward. In Chili they are &s;aid to be of &s;uch a va&s;t height, that the Alps are no more than hillocks to them.</P>
<P>The &s;oil of Chili, in general, is amazingly fertile, producing Indian and European corn, hemp, wine, fruits, and all the nece&s;&s;aries of life in the greate&s;t a|bundance and perfection. The produce of the Eu|ropean fruit trees here is &s;o exuberant, that the boughs mu&s;t be propped, to enable them to bear the weight of the fruit. The orchards, in particular, yield great quantities of all kinds of apples. The &s;trawberries are as big as pears, and mo&s;t com|monly red, but in &s;ome places white and yel|low. In the gardens of the cities near the &s;ea|coa&s;t, they have orange-trees in bloom or fruit all the year. Olives al&s;o, and almond trees, thrive very well; and there is great plenty of the mo&s;t noble and generous wines, e&s;pecially the Mu&s;ca|del. The grapes are va&s;tly large, and the trunks of the vines, in &s;ome places, as thick as a man's body.</P>
<P>This country abounds in mines of gold, &s;ilver, copper, tin, quick&s;ilver, iron, and lead. In the countries of Coquambo and Gua&s;co, mines of all kinds of metals are &s;o very common, that the whole earth &s;eems to be wholly compo&s;ed of mine|rals; and it is here tho&s;e of copper are worked, of which the great guns for Peru and the neighbour|ing kingdoms are made, with the bells of churches,
<PB N="431" REF="4320">
and family uten&s;ils. Neither the &s;ilver, quick&s;il|ver, or leadmines in Chili are much worked, becau&s;e there is plenty of &s;ilver in Peru, and little occa&s;ion for lead; and as to &s;ilver, be&s;ides the rich mines of that metal in Peru, the working of the gold mines here is more profitable and le&s;s chargeable, not to mention what is got from the natives, and wa&s;hed down from the mountains by brooks and torrents. All the gold thus collected in Chili, mo&s;t of which is from twenty-one to twenty-three carrats fine, is brought to Lima to be coined; and by the ac|counts con&s;tantly taken, amounts, one year with another, to &s;ix hundred thou&s;and dollars; but that clande&s;tinely &s;ent, by way of the Cordilleras, is &s;aid to be near four hundred thou&s;and; con&s;equently, the whole mu&s;t be at lea&s;t a million.</P>
<P>The other products and commodities of Chili are, cattle of all kinds, e&s;pecially mules; tallow, hides, dried fi&s;h, flax, cordage, cocoa-nuts, &s;ole leather tanned, Cordovan leather, gra&s;&s;a, char|qui, and neats tongues. Of mo&s;t of the&s;e articles great quantities are exported, e&s;pecially to Lima and Panama; whence they receive, in return, the merchandize of the Ea&s;t-Indies and Europe.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides all the advantages mentioned above, Chi|li is &s;aid to be free from venomous creatures; &s;uch as vipers, &s;nakes, &s;corpions, and toads; nor are there any panthers, tygers, or other mi&s;chievous animals, except &s;ome lions of a &s;mall kind, which &s;ometimes attack and kill &s;heep and goats, but fly from men. That &s;pecies of hogs which have their navels on their backs, and are called pecarees, is found here. The&s;e, we are told, go in great herds, with each a leader; and that, till he is killed, it is dangerous to attack them, but that when he falls, they immediately di&s;per&s;e. The hair of the wild|goats, and the wool of the &s;heep called guanacos, which are &s;haped like camels, but of a le&s;s &s;ize, are
<PB N="432" REF="4330">
&s;aid to be as &s;oft and fine as &s;ilk, and u&s;ed for much the &s;ame purpo&s;es.</P>
<P>We have already related, under Peru, how the Spa|niards e&s;tabli&s;hed them&s;elves in this country: as the martial genius of the natives greatly retarded their conque&s;ts, &s;o it has always been the cau&s;e why the Spani&s;h &s;ettlements here are &s;o di&s;proportionate to the extent, fertility, and riches of the country. The free Indians are much more numerous than the Spaniards, who are computed at no more than twenty thou&s;and. All the inhabitants of Chili, including Europeans, Me&s;tizoes, mulat|toes, and negroes, are reckoned at one hundred and fifty thou&s;and only. Even the free Indians, it &s;eems, now acknowledge the dominion of the king of Spain, and pay tribute to his governor; but the &s;ubjected Indians belong entirely to the Spa|niards, living among them, and &s;erving them in the &s;ame manner as the natives of Peru and Mexi|co. The greater part of Chili is &s;till po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the free Indians, who are rather allies than &s;ubjects of Spain, having, it is &s;aid, in the la&s;t treaty, con|&s;ented to acknowledge the king of Spain for their lawful &s;overeign, only upon condition that they were &s;uffered to continue under the protection of their own laws and government; an engagement which it will be hazardous for the Spaniards to break, however it may counteract their great de&s;ign of gaining entire po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the&s;e countries, and thereby repairing the con&s;tant decline of wealth, and decay of the precious metals, in their other &s;ettlements. The free Indians are governed by their own chiefs, whom the Spaniards call ca|ciques, who claim no authority, be&s;ides that of admini&s;tering ju&s;tice, and commanding their tribes in time of war; having neither palaces, guards, nor revenue, or any other badges of &s;overeign au|thority. The Chili&s;ians are of a middle &s;tature,
<PB N="433" REF="4340">
&s;trong built, of a tawny complexion, and have long black hair on their heads, but pluck off that on their chins or other parts of their bodies. They are tall, robu&s;t, active, and courageous, enduring fatigue, heat and cold, to admiration. Their arms are pikes, bows, arrows, and &s;words; and their di&s;ci|pline much more regular than that of the other In|dians. Their manners are very &s;imple. They have no gold or &s;ilver, though the&s;e metals are &s;o common in their country. All their bedding is &s;ome &s;kins, laid on the ground; and they eat on the ground, or el&s;e on a little bench, and wipe their hands on a broom, in&s;tead of a napkin. Their food is of maiz, fruits, herbs, and what they catch by hunting and fi&s;hing. Their drink al&s;o is made of maiz toa&s;ted, &s;teeped and boiled, or of fruits. Their furniture con&s;i&s;ts of four or five di&s;hes, and &s;ome wooden &s;poons, or &s;hells, a ca|laba&s;h or gourd to drink out of, and a leaf of a tree or maiz, for a &s;alt-&s;eller. When they make bread, they &s;et great earthen platters, full of &s;and upon the fire, and when hot enough, take them off, put the grains of maiz into the hot &s;and, &s;tir them about, till they be toa&s;ted enough for the purpo&s;e, and then grind them between two &s;tones. They let blood with a &s;harp flint, fixed in a little piece of wood, and ju&s;t long enough to open a vein. Though they can neither read nor write, yet they have a peculiar way of regi&s;tering events, and keeping accounts of things committed to their charge, by &s;trings of different &s;izes, in which they make knots of &s;everal colours, called qui|pos. Frezier tells us, that the knowledge of the&s;e knots is a &s;ecret &s;cience, which fathers do not re|veal to their children, till they find their death draw near.</P>
<P>There never was a temple or idol found in this country, nor does it appear that they ever wor&s;hip|ped
<PB N="434" REF="4350">
any; yet they have &s;ome confu&s;ed notions of a future &s;tate, for they put meat, drink, and cloaths into the coffins of the decea&s;ed, to &s;erve them in the other world.</P>
<P>The &s;ubjected Indians are divided into little lord|&s;hips, con&s;i&s;ting of a certain number of families, more or le&s;s, called commanderies, which the king of Spain gives to whom he plea&s;es. If the Indians &s;erve their lord, he mu&s;t not only maintain them, but give each of them thirty pieces of eight a|year. On the other hand, if the Indians are not in|clined to live with their lord, they are excu&s;ed, on condition of paying him an annual tribute of ten pieces of eight.</P>
<P>The free Indians, at pre&s;ent, admit Spani&s;h mi&s;|&s;ionaries among them, and &s;hew an inclination to embrace the go&s;pel-doctrine, to which their great|e&s;t objection is, le&s;t it &s;hould bring them to &s;lavery. They enter ea&s;ily into the Spani&s;h mea&s;ures, which gives great plea&s;ure to the coloni&s;ts, in hopes they may thereby bring them to &s;ubmit voluntarily to the yoke, which they could not impo&s;e upon them by force.</P>
<P>The audience of Chili is divided into three pro|vinces, viz. the provinces or bi&s;hoprics of St. Ja|go and Conception, and the province of Chicuito, which lies beyond the mountains.</P>
<P>The principal places in the bi&s;hopric of St. Ja|go, or Chili Proper, are St. Jago, and Valperai&s;o.</P>
<P>St. Jago, the capital of Chili, founded in the year 1541 by Valdivia, &s;tands in 33&deg;. 40&prime;. &s;outh la|titude, at the we&s;t foot of the Cordillera mountains, on the little river Mapocho, which gives name to a valley of great extent, and &s;upplies the city with water, for cooling and clean&s;ing the &s;treets, watering their gardens, and other purpo&s;es. In the centre of the city &s;tands the grand piazza, which, like that at Lima, is &s;quare, with a very
<PB N="435" REF="4360">
beautiful fountain in the middle. Here are the apartments of the governor or pre&s;ident, the palace of the royal audience, the town-hou&s;e, the public pri&s;on, the cathedral, and many other hand&s;ome public and private buildings. The Spaniards in St. Jago, and the large &s;uburb of Chimba on the other &s;ide of the river, are reckoned to amount to eight thou&s;and, and the other inhabitants to about thirty thou&s;and. Tho&s;e who have acquired for|tunes at Baldivia, Valparai&s;o, and Conception, re|pair hither, to &s;pend their days in ea&s;e and enjoy|ment. In the neighbourhood are the gold mines of Tiltil, and the Lavaderoes, by their concerns in which many of the citizens ama&s;s va&s;t fortunes. The royal audience re&s;iding in St. Jago, &s;ince its removal from Conception, is compo&s;ed of a pre&s;i|dent, four auditors, and a fi&s;cal; together with an officer, who bears the title of protector of the In|dians. Though &s;ubordinate, in &s;ome re&s;pects, to the viceroy of Peru, the determinations of the court are without appeal, except to the council of the In|dies. The pre&s;ident is al&s;o governor and captain|general of the whole kingdom of Chili, in which quality he re&s;ides one half of the year in the capital, and the other at Conception. There is a tribunal of the inqui&s;ition in this city, and the &s;ee of a bi|&s;hop, &s;ubordinate to the archbi&s;hop of Lima. Earthquakes have often done a great deal of da|mage here: that of 1647 was &s;o violent, that it al|mo&s;t overturned the whole town, and left &s;uch un|whole&s;ome vapours in the air, that all the inhabi|tants died, except about three or four hundred. Another dreadful &s;hock in 1730, laid the city in ruins.</P>
<P>Valparai&s;o, a &s;mall town, is &s;ituated in 32&deg;. 15&prime;. &s;outh latitude. The bay or harbour, tho' greatly expo&s;ed in winter to the north winds, which then blow with great violence, is much frequented by
<PB N="436" REF="4370">
&s;hips from Callao and Panama. Though there is a fort here, called Ca&s;tello Blanco, and other works, they are generally in a bad condition, which is the ca&s;e of mo&s;t of the Spani&s;h fortifications in Ame|rica.</P>
<P>The other places in this province worth men|tioning are, Quintero, La Serena or Coquimbo, Gua&s;co, and Copiapo.</P>
<P>Quintero is a &s;mall place, five leagues to the northward of Valparai&s;o, having a port much fre|quented by &s;hipping, but entirely without defence.</P>
<P>La Serena, or Coquimbo, is a &s;mall place, &s;itu|ated a quarter of a league from the &s;ea, on the ri|ver Coquimbo, in 30&deg;. of &s;outh latitude, accord|ing to Dampier. It had the name of Serena from the deliciou&s;ne&s;s of the climate; for here the &s;ky is continually &s;erene and plea&s;ant, the winters warm, and the &s;ummer heats tempered with refre&s;hing breezes. The &s;oil too is &s;aid to be as fertile as the climate is delightful. Coquimbo gives name to a large bay, the mouth of which is two leagues and a half wide, and the bottom every where good. In the neighbouring country are mines of gold, &s;ilver, and copper, and al&s;o, if we can tru&s;t to &s;ome ac|counts, of quick&s;ilver and iron.</P>
<P>Gua&s;co is a &s;ea-port, but little frequented, &s;itu|ated on a &s;mall river of the &s;ame name, thirty miles to the north of La Serena, according to Dampier, but, according to the maps, ninety-five. The neigh|bouring country is &s;aid to be well peopled with Spaniards.</P>
<P>Copiapo is an open town, one hundred and &s;even|ty-five miles to the north of La Serena, taking its name from a river. There are gold mines directly above the town, and others at two or three leagues di&s;tance, whence they bring the ore on mules to the mills within the town. The ounce of gold
<PB N="437" REF="4380">
here is &s;old for twelve or thirteen pieces of eight, ca&s;t. Be&s;ides the gold mines, there are about Co|piapo many of iron, copper, tin, and lead, with &s;al gem, &s;altpetre, &s;ulphur, load&s;tone, and lapis lazuli</P>
<P>The province or bi&s;hopric of Conception lies to the &s;outh of that of St Jago. The mo&s;t con&s;idera|ble places in it are, the towns of Conception and Baldivia.</P>
<P>Conception, &s;ituated in 36&deg;. 43&prime;. 15&Prime;. &s;outh lati|tude, at the bottom of a bay of the &s;ame name, is the olde&s;t European Spani&s;h e&s;tabli&s;hment in Chi|li, and the &s;econd city in point of dignity. The &s;ame earthquake that de&s;troyed St. Jago, in 1730, laid this city al&s;o in ruins. The harbour is good, and pretty much frequented; but the fortifications of very little importance, though there is, or ought to be, a garri&s;on of three thou&s;and five hundred men. That the fortifications in Chili and Peru are in a ruinous condition, and the garri&s;ons &s;carce half their complement, is owing to the negligence and &s;ecurity, but chiefly to the avarice, of the go|vernors, who think of nothing but enriching them|&s;elves. The beauties of the country adjacent to this city are enchanting; and the returns of nature, for the hu&s;bandman's toil, exuberant. Some far|mers apply them&s;elves wholly to rai&s;ing corn, others to breeding and fattening of &s;heep and cat|tle; &s;ome to the breeding of hor&s;es, and others to the culture of vines and fruit trees: hence, the vallies are filled with cattle, and the fleecy kind; and &s;o numerous is the breed of hor&s;es, that one which would co&s;t thirty or forty pounds in the cheape&s;t country in Europe, may be here pur|cha&s;ed for a twentieth part of the &s;um.</P>
<P>The pea&s;ants in the neighbourhood of Concep|tion are remarkable for their addre&s;s in the u&s;e of the noo&s;e and lance. According to Ullea with
<PB N="438" REF="4390">
the&s;e weapons they will combat the fierce&s;t bull, throwing the noo&s;e &s;o artfully, as to lay certain hold of &s;ome part of the body. When a bull is haltered, they draw the k$ot, at the &s;ame time giving &s;purs to their hor&s;es, and ham&s;tringing him with their lances, &s;o that the animal is taken and di&s;abled at the &s;ame in&s;tant This dexterity in throwing the noo&s;e, and ham&s;tringing the animal in an in&s;tant, while they ride at full &s;peed, cannot fail of &s;urprizing Europeans. In private quarrels al&s;o, they fight with the noo&s;e and lance; all attacks from which they are taught to parry with &s;uch dexterity, that, after a combat of an hour, it is no uncommon ca&s;e to &s;ee the parties &s;eparate untouched, notwith&s;tanding both have exerted the greate&s;t alertne&s;s.</P>
<P>Conception is the &s;ee of a bi&s;hop, which was transferred hither at the time that the city Imperial was de&s;troyed by the Indians. The inhabitants are numerous; the fertility of the &s;oil, and the excel|lency of the climate, having induced a great num|ber of Spaniards and Me&s;tizoes to &s;ettle here.</P>
<P>Baldivia, or, as the Spaniards &s;pell it, Valdivia, &s;tands about one hundred and ninety five miles &s;outh of Conception, at the bottom of a fine bay, in 39&deg;. 36&Prime; &s;outh latitude, on a river to which it gives name, as it takes its own from the fir&s;t conqueror of this country. It is defended by four &s;trong ca&s;tles, mounting above a hundred pieces of fine bra&s;s cannon; but there is never a &s;ufficient number of gunners and carriages, nor &s;tore of ammunition: be&s;ides, what dependence can be placed upon a gar|ri&s;on compo&s;ed of tran&s;ported criminals, who are &s;ent hither in&s;tead of being la&s;hed to the oar on board the gallies. The inhabitants are &s;aid to amount to about two thou&s;and. Ten large &s;hips are employed in the trade between this port and Lima, which con&s;i&s;ts chiefly in gold, corn, hides,

<P>The province of Chicuito, which lies on the op|po&s;ite &s;ide of the Andes, and by &s;ome is reckoned a part of La Plata, is &s;aid to contain &s;everal towns, of which Mendoza, San Juan de la Frontera, Uto, and St. Lewis, are mentioned as the chief; but no particular de&s;cription is given of them.</P>
<P>Off the coa&s;t of Chili are a great many i&s;lands, the chief of which are Chiloe, St. Mary's, Quiriquina, de la Moca or Mocha, Juan Fernandes, Tierra, and Fuera.</P>

<P>Chiloe is a large and beautiful i&s;land, containing a town called Ca&s;tro, and &s;urrounded with a great number of &s;maller i&s;lands, to which it gives name; but the other three are incon&s;iderable.</P>
<P>The i&s;land of Juan Fernandes, of which there is a minute de&s;cription in An&s;on's Voyage, lies up|wards of one hundred leagues from the continent, in 33&deg;. 40&prime;. of &s;outh latitude. It is about twelve leagues round, full of hills, inter&s;per&s;ed with &s;mall plea&s;ant vallies and &s;avannahs, which, if cultivated, would produce any thing proper for the climate.

<HEAD>TERRA-MAGELLANICA, or PATAGONIA.</HEAD>
<P>Terra-Magellanica, or Patagonia, comprehends all that country extending from Chili and Para|guay to the utmo&s;t extremity of South America, that is, from 35 almo&s;t to 54&deg;. of latitude; being &s;urrounded by the countries ju&s;t mentioned, the South and North Seas, and the Straits of Magellan, which &s;eparate it from the i&s;land called Terra del Fuego, and extend about one hundred and &s;ixteen leagues in length, from &s;ea to &s;ea, but only from half a league to three or four in breadth.</P>
<P>This country had the name of Terra-Magellani|ca from Ferdinand Magellan, a Portugue&s;e officer in the &s;ervice of the catholic king, who is reported to have &s;ailed through the &s;traits, that al&s;o bear his name, from the North to the South Sea, in the year 1510.</P>

Towards the north, it is &s;aid to be covered with wood, and &s;tored with an inex|hau&s;tible fund of large timber; whereas, to the &s;outhward, not &s;o much as a &s;ingle tree, fit for any mechanical purpo&s;e, is to be &s;een; yet there is good

pa&s;ture, and incredible numbers of wild horned cat|tle and hor&s;es, which were fir&s;t brought hither by the Spaniards, and have increa&s;ed amazingly. Fre&s;h water, we are told by &s;ome writers, is very &s;carce; but if that was really the ca&s;e, we cannot &s;ee how the pre&s;ent inhabitants, and &s;uch multitudes of cat|tle, could &s;ub&s;i&s;t. The ea&s;t coa&s;t is mo&s;tly low land, with few or no good harbours: one of the be&s;t is Port St. Julian.</P>
<P>Patagonia is inhabited by a variety of Indian tribes, as the Patagons, from which the country takes its name, the Pampas, the Co&s;&s;ares, &amp;c. of whom we know very little; only it appears, from the accounts of former voyages, lately confirmed by commodore Byron and his crew, that &s;ome of them are of a gigantic &s;tature, and cloathed with &s;kins; but it would &s;eem, that there are others, who go al|mo&s;t quite naked, notwith&s;tanding the inclemency of the climate. Some of them al&s;o, that live about the Straits, if we may credit the navigators who have pa&s;&s;ed that way into the South Sea, are perfect &s;avages; but tho&s;e with whom commo|dore Byron and his people conver&s;ed, are repre|&s;ented as of a more gentle humane di&s;po&s;ition, on|ly, like other &s;avages, they live on fi&s;h and game, and what the earth produces &s;pontaneou&s;ly.</P>
<P>The Spaniards once built a fort upon the Straits, and left a garri&s;on in it, to prevent any other Eu|ropean nation pa&s;&s;ing that way into the South Sea; but mo&s;t of the men peri&s;hed by famine, whence the place obtained the name of Port Famine; and no people have attempted to plant colonies here ever &s;ince.</P>
<P>About the middle of the Strait is a promontory, called Cape Froi&s;ard, which is the mo&s;t &s;outherly on the continent of South-America.</P>
<P>On the coa&s;ts of Patagonia lie a great number of i&s;lands, or clu&s;ters of i&s;lands. On the we&s;t coa&s;t
<PB N="442" REF="4430">
are the i&s;lands Madre de Dios, Santa Trinidad, Santa Cruz, the I&s;les of the Chunians and Huil|lans, the Sarmientos, and many others, to the number of eighty in all, as &s;ome &s;ay. Of tho&s;e on the &s;outh coa&s;t the mo&s;t con&s;iderable are, Terra del Fuego, and Staten Land. The fir&s;t had its name, which &s;ignifies the Land of Fire, from the fir&s;t di&s;|coverers, upon their ob&s;erving &s;ome great fires, &s;uppo&s;ed to be volcanos, upon it, as they pa&s;&s;ed in the night through the &s;traits that lie between it and the continent. It is not certain whether it is a &s;ingle i&s;land or a clu&s;ter of i&s;lands; or whe|ther it is inhabited or not. The land appears to be rough and mountainous, inter&s;ected with deep narrow vallies, and watered by a great many brooks and rivers. Some tell us, that it is in|habited, and that the inhabitants are naturally as fair as the Europeans; that they go naked, and paint thair bodies; and that tho&s;e on the &s;outh &s;ide are rude, treacherous, and barbarous; while tho&s;e on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide are &s;imple, affable, and perfectly harmle&s;s. The &s;outhern extremity of this i&s;land, or clu&s;ter of i&s;lands, is called Cape Horn. Staten Land is repre&s;ented as an i&s;land much re&s;embling Terra del Fuego. Betwixt the&s;e lie the &s;traits which take their name from Le Maire, one of the circumnavigators of the globe. To the north of Staten Land, in the Atlantic Ocean, lie Falkland I&s;lands, on which the Engli&s;h and French were &s;aid to have lately made &s;ettlements.</P>
<P>The I&s;le of Penquins, which lies near the ea&s;t coa&s;t of Patagonia, is remarkable only for taking its name from a white-headed bird, as large as a goo&s;e, with which it abounds.</P>

<HEAD>BRASIL.</HEAD>
<P>All that tract of country &s;tretching along the &s;ea-coa&s;t from the mouth of the river La Plata,
<PB N="443" REF="4440">
in the 35&deg;. of &s;outh latitude, to the great river of Amazons, under the equator, that is, upwards of two thou&s;and miles, is denominated Brazil, and &s;ubject to the crown of Portugal. It is reported to extend from ea&s;t to we&s;t, or from the Atlantic to Paraguay, about nine hundred miles, though the Portugue&s;e have no &s;ettlements in the interior country.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t a&s;pect of this country from the &s;ea is rather unfavourable, as it appears high, rough, and unequal; but, on a nearer view, nothing can be more delightful, the eminences being covered with woods, the trees of which are mo&s;t|ly evergreens, and the vallies and &s;avannahs with the mo&s;t refre&s;hing verdure Far within land, indeed, are high mountains, which &s;eparate it from the Spani&s;h province of Paraguay or La Plata, and in the&s;e are innumerable &s;prings and lakes, from whence i&s;&s;ue abundance of rivers, that fall into the great rivers Amazon and Para|guay, or run acro&s;s the country from we&s;t to ea&s;t, and fall into the Atlantic Ocean.</P>
<P>In &s;o va&s;t a tract, it cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed that the climate is alike, and the &s;ea&s;ons uniform. The northern provinces, which lie towards the equator, like other countries in the like &s;ituation, are &s;ubject to great rains and variable winds, particularly in the months of March and September, when they have &s;uch deluges of rain, with &s;torms and torna|does, that the country is almo&s;t quite overflowed, and the air rendered unhealthful. As to the more &s;outhern provinces, there is no country between the tropics where the heats are more tolerable, or the air more healthful than this; being con&s;tantly re|fre&s;hed with breezes from the &s;ea, and abounding with lakes and rivers, which annually overflow their banks; and in the inland parts the winds that blow from the mountains are &s;till cooler than tho&s;e that blow from the ocean.</P>
<P><PB N="444" REF="4450">
This country breeds a great variety of &s;erpents and venomous creatures; among which are, the In|dian &s;alamander, a kind of four legged in&s;ect, who&s;e &s;ting is mortal; the ibibaboka, a kind of &s;erpent, about &s;even yards long, and half a yard in circumference, who&s;e poi&s;on is in&s;tantaneou&s;ly fatal to the human kind; the rattle-&s;nake, which grows here to an enormous &s;ize; the liboya, or roebuck|&s;nake, which is &s;aid to be able to &s;wallow a roe|buck whole, with its horns, being between twenty and thirty feet in length, and two or three yards in circumference; &s;corpions, one &s;ort of which are between four and five feet long; lizards, of three or four feet long; mellipides, both venomous and dangerous; and many others. The pi&s;mires here are very large, numerous, and de&s;tructive, devouring all that comes in their way.</P>
<P>Among the wild bea&s;ts of Bra&s;il are, ant-bears; tygers or madilloes; porcupines; janonveras, a very fierce ravenous animal, &s;omewhat like a greyhound; armadilloes; various &s;orts of monkeys, &s;ome of which are very large; that called by Europeans the &s;loth, or lazy bea&s;t; and the topira&s;&s;on, a crea|ture between a bull and an a&s;s, but without horns, and harmle&s;s, &amp;c. The fle&s;h of the topera&s;&s;on is good, and ta&s;tes like beef. They have great plen|ty of deer, hares, and other game, and a variety of other animals, wild and tame.</P>
<P>No country on earth affords a greater number of birds; &s;ome remarkable for their beauty, and others for their ta&s;te. Of the fir&s;t &s;ort is the humming|bird, &s;o called from the noi&s;e he makes with his wings, when he &s;ucks the juices of flowers. Co|real, who calls it colubri, &s;ays, it is not much big|ger than a fly, and has a mo&s;t melodious voice, like that of a nightingale, and near as loud. Their feathers, which way &s;oever you turn them, appear of a different colour and hue, like tho&s;e of
<PB N="445" REF="4460">
the &s;un-beams through a pri&s;m, on which account, it is not unfitly called by the natives the &s;un-beam. The anhima hath a horn two or three inches long growing out of its forehead, and, on that account, is called by Europeans the unicorn-bird. The toucan is of the bigne&s;s of a wood-pigeon, and of a perfect jet-black all over, except under the brea&s;t and belly, which is of a fine yellow, and a &s;mall cir|cle of red about the neck; but what is mo&s;t ex|traordinary in this bird is, that its bill is bigger than the re&s;t of its body, yellow without and red within, and about a &s;pan long. The guira, called by Europeans the &s;ea-curlew, and the &s;ame with the numonius indicus, and arenata concinea, of the Latin authors, is remarkable for its often changing its native colour, being at fir&s;t black, then a&s;h-co|loured, next white, afterwards &s;carlet, and la&s;t of all crim&s;on, which la&s;t grows richer and deeper the longer the bird liveth. The cocoi, a very beautiful bird, parroquets, parrots, cuckatoo&sacute;, macaws, and variety of others, are very common here. Their eat|able fowls are turkies, very large and delicious; a &s;ort of white hens, and other poultry; ducks, and other &s;uch water-fowl. Their bats are of a pro|digous &s;ize. It is &s;aid, they will go into hou&s;es in the night, and if they find any per&s;ons a&s;leep, and uncovered, they will fa&s;ten on them, and &s;uck their blood.</P>
<P>The &s;ea-coa&s;ts, lakes, and rivers, are &s;tored with great plenty and variety of fi&s;h, among which is the globe-fi&s;h, called by the Latins orbis minor, from its orbicular form, which is &s;o be&s;et all round with &s;harp &s;pikes, like tho&s;e of a hedgehog, that it bids defiance to all fi&s;hes of prey. But of all the living creatures in this &s;ea, the mo&s;t remarkable is the &s;ea-bladder, &s;o called becau&s;e it greatly re&s;embles one, and &s;wims on the &s;urface of the waves. The in&s;ide is only filled with air, except about a &s;poon|ful
<PB N="446" REF="4470">
of water, that &s;erves to poi&s;e it. The &s;kin is very thin and tran&s;parent, and, like a bubble rai&s;ed in the water, reflects all the colours of the &s;ky.</P>
<P>Of woods, roots, and plants, here is a va&s;t variety. Brazil or red wood is very common here, e&s;pe|cially in rocky and barren ground, where it often grows to a great height and con&s;iderable thick|ne&s;s. The flowers are of a bright red, and have a &s;trong aromatic and refre&s;hing &s;mell. The wood is of a red colour, hard and dry, and is u&s;ed in dying red; but the red which it produces is far from being of the be&s;t kind. It is al&s;o in &s;ome ca&s;es u&s;ed as a medicine, both as a &s;tomachic and a&s;tringent. They have five different kinds of palm trees here, with &s;ome fine woods of ebony, citron, cotton-trees, ma&s;tick, be&s;ides many others, &s;ome of which di&s;til excellent bal&s;ams, and diffu&s;e a mo&s;t exqui&s;ite fragrancy, and others yield the mo&s;t delicious fruits.</P>
<P>Of the other commodities and products of Bra|&s;il, the chief are ambergrea&s;e, ro&s;in, bal&s;ams, in|digo, &s;weet meats, &s;ugar, tobacco, gold, diamonds, beautiful pebbles, chry&s;tal, emeralds, ja&s;per, and other precious &s;tones, in all which the Portugue&s;e carry on a va&s;t trade. The mines of gold and dia|monds were fir&s;t opened in the year 1681, and have &s;ince yielded above five million &s;terling annually, of which &s;um a fifth belongs to the crown. The diamond mines are farmed at about thirty thou&s;and pounds yearly, which is thought to be &s;carce a fifth of what they actually produce. The Bra&s;il clayed &s;ugar is much finer and whiter than that we bring home from our plantations; and their to|bacco is al&s;o remarkably good. Of the la&s;t arti|cle, they export great quantities to the coa&s;t of Africa; where they not only di&s;po&s;e of it to the natives, but even &s;upply the ve&s;&s;els of other na|tions, who are obliged to purcha&s;e it, for the con|venience
<PB N="447" REF="4480">
of carrying on the gold-du&s;t and &s;lave trade with any tolerable advantage. The north and &s;outh parts of Bra&s;il abound with horned cat|tle, which are hunted for their hides, of which no le&s;s than twenty thou&s;and are annually exported to Europe.</P>
<P>The Portugue&s;e trade hither is &s;o increa&s;ed, that in&s;tead of twelve &s;hips, formerly employed in the Bra&s;il commerce, there are never fewer than one hundred &s;ail of large ve&s;&s;els con&s;tantly going and returning from tho&s;e colonies. The &s;lave trade, from the multitude of &s;laves annually tran&s;ported from Africa to Bra&s;il mu&s;t employ a great number of &s;hipping. All the &s;hips employed in the Bra&s;il trade, being under the direction of the govern|ment, have their appointed &s;ea&s;ons for going and returning, under convoy of a certain number of men of war; nor can a &s;ingle &s;hip clear out, or &s;et &s;ail, except with the fleet, but by a &s;pecial licence from the king, which is &s;eldom granted. The fleets &s;ail in the following order, and at the following &s;tated periods: that to Rio Janeiro &s;ets &s;ail in Ja|nuary; that to Bahia, or the Bay of All Saints, in February; and the third fleet to Fernambuco, in the month of March. The cargoes of the&s;e fleets, like tho&s;e of the Spani&s;h to their American colonies, con&s;i&s;t of a variety of articles, furni&s;hed by &s;everal European nations.</P>
<P>The crown revenue ari&s;ing from this colony is &s;aid to amount to two hundred thou&s;and pounds &s;terling in gold, if we may credit &s;ome late writers, be&s;ides the duties and cu&s;toms on merchandize im|ported from that quarter.</P>
<P>For the better regulation of government, Bra&s;il is divided into fifteen provinces, called capitaneas, or captainries, the whole being a principality, which gives title to the pre&s;umptive heir of the crown of Portugal. Of the&s;e captainries, eight only are an|nexed
<PB N="448" REF="4490">
to the crown, the re&s;t being fiefs, made over to &s;ome of the nobility, in reward of their extraor|dinary &s;ervices, who do little more than acknow|ledge the &s;overeignty of the crown of Portugal.</P>
<P>The principal places in Bra&s;il are, St. Salvadore, Rio de Janeiro, and Fernambuco.</P>
<P>St. Salvador, called al&s;o Cividad de Bahia, the mo&s;t magnificent, populous, and opulent city of Bra&s;il, &s;tands in the province, and on the Bay of All Saints, (Bahia de todos los Santos) in 12&deg;. 11&prime;. &s;outh latitude. It is not only &s;trong by nature, but well fortified, and always defended by a good gar|ri&s;on. A prodigious trade is carried on in this ci|ty, which is al&s;o the &s;ee of an archbi&s;hop, and the re&s;idence of the viceroy, who acts both in a civil and military capacity, and maintains the &s;tate and court of a &s;overeign prince. The air and climate are inferior to tho&s;e of &s;ome of the other provinces. The &s;treets here are crouded with negroes, men and women, quite naked, except a &s;mall clout round their middle. There are al&s;o &s;hops, and other open places, filled with the&s;e mi&s;erable naked crea|tures, expo&s;ed to public &s;ale, like cattle.</P>
<P>Rio de Janeiro, a rich and populous city, &s;tands about two leagues from the main ocean, on a bay formed by the river of the &s;ame name. It is al&s;o called St. Seba&s;tian, having an admirable port, which is now more re&s;orted to by the Portugue&s;e than any other in Bra&s;il, on account of the gold and diamonds which are found in the mountains of this and the neighbouring province of St. Vin|cent. The Rio de Janeiro is &s;aid to have been &s;o named by John de Solis, who fir&s;t di&s;covered it, in the month of January. The town and bay are guarded by &s;everal forts.</P>
<P>Fernambuco, Fernambucco, or Pernambuco, the chief town of the province to which it gives name, and one of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable in Bra&s;il.
<PB N="449" REF="4500">
It is al&s;o called Rerief, or Arrarife, from a neigh|bouring harbour of that name, which is now the &s;tronge&s;t in all Bra&s;il, a number of forts being erected all round, and the acce&s;s naturally &s;o intri|cate and dangerous, by rea&s;on of the concealed rocks, &s;ands, and little i&s;lands about it, that the a&s;|&s;i&s;tance of a &s;kilful pilot is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to avoid them. Hence the name Fernambuco would &s;eem to be only a contraction of In&s;erno Boco, or the Mouth of Hell.</P>
<P>There are many more towns in Bra&s;il, and &s;ome of them con&s;iderable; as Olinda, in the province of Fernambuco; Paraiba, St. Vincent, Tamora, or Tamarica, and Sierra, in the provinces &s;o named; Belem, or Para, in the province of Paria; and Maragnano, in an i&s;land and captainry of that name, towards the northern extremity of Bra&s;il.</P>
<P>About thirty miles north of the province of St. Vincent, which is the mo&s;t &s;outherly of Bra&s;il, lies the little republic of St. Paul, &s;urrounded by lofty mountains and thick fore&s;ts. This &s;tate was ori|ginally compo&s;ed of outlaws from all the neigh|bouring colonies, Spaniards, Portugue&s;e, Creoles, Me&s;tizoes, mulattoes, and negroes, who took re|fuge on this &s;pot, and lived at fir&s;t without order, &s;ociety, faith, honour, or religion; preying upon each other, and &s;ub&s;i&s;ting by mutual rapine, and the plunder of their neighbours; but the inconve|niences attending this way of life, and the danger to which it expo&s;ed them, &s;oon drove them into confederacies, and the&s;e, at la&s;t, produced a regular democracy. If they were more numerous, they would be formidable to the Portugue&s;e colonies; but as they are not reputed above four or five thou&s;and, and want fire-arms, they give no appre|hen&s;ions, and con&s;equently no attempts are made to reduce them. At pre&s;ent, this little community elaims entire independence; though they pay an
<PB N="450" REF="4510">
annual tribute to the king out of their gold mines, rather to pre&s;erve commercial benefits than to ac|knowledge his &s;overeignty, being far &s;hort of the fifth of the produce of their mines. This the Bra&s;ilian government are not ignorant of; but know not how to force a people that inhabit &s;uch inacce&s;&s;ible mountains, and are ever fortifying tho&s;e pa&s;&s;es, which they think not to be &s;trong enough by nature. It was the tyranny of the Bra&s;ilian go|vernors that gave birth to this little &s;tate, which is grown now &s;o jealous of its liberty, that no &s;tranger is &s;uffered to &s;et foot within its dominions, except run-away &s;laves; and if the&s;e, after a full examination, are not able to clear them&s;elves of all &s;ini&s;ter de&s;igns, they are in&s;tantly put to death.</P>
<P>The territory of the republic is &s;aid to produce good wheat, and to be very proper for feeding cattle; and the gold mines in it are reported to be exceeding rich. Their capital, called St. Paul, we are told al&s;o, is a neat, well built, and opulent town; but all that is known of them is from the reports of negro-&s;laves, who have found means to make their e&s;cape from them.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides their &s;ettlements on the continent of Bra|&s;il, the Portugue&s;e have now a flouri&s;hing colony on the i&s;land of St. Catherine, though it was ori|ginally peopled by the convicts and outlaws tran&s;|ported from Bra&s;il and Portugal. This i&s;land, &s;ituated in 27&deg;. 35&prime;. of &s;outh latitude, is one of the mo&s;t beautiful, temperate, and fertile &s;pots in the world, extending about twenty-&s;even miles in length, and &s;ix in breadth. A great part of the i&s;land is over-run with thick woods, which appear perpetually green, and abound with orange, lemon, citron, guava, cabbage, and cotton trees, and game. This i&s;land yields al&s;o Indian wheat, &s;ugar|canes, melons, &s;a&s;&s;afras, guiacum, the be&s;t potatoes
<PB N="451" REF="4520">
in the world, and many other drugs, roots, and plants.</P>
<P>Of the natives in Bra&s;il, the mo&s;t con&s;iderable tribes are, the Tapuyers, and Topinamboys; of whom the former inhabit the northern, and the other the &s;outhern parts. The former are men of a good &s;tature, of a dark copper colour, their hair black, and hanging over their &s;houlders; but they &s;uffer no hair on their bodies or faces, and go almo&s;t naked, the women only concealing their pudenda with leaves, like their mother Eve. Their ornaments are, glittering &s;tones, hung upon their lips or no&s;|trils, and bracelets of feathers upon their arms: the men have al&s;o a cap or coronet of feathers.</P>
<P>The complexions of the Topinamboys are not &s;o dark as their northern neighbours, who live nearer the line; and neither the one nor the other as tho&s;e of the Africans, who lie under the &s;ame parallels. The native Bra&s;ilians are partly freemen, and partly &s;laves; but the negro-&s;laves are much more va|lued, being of a more robu&s;t con&s;titution, and fitter for labour.</P>
<P>The Bra&s;ilians have been repre&s;ented as a &s;avage people, devoid of all principles of religion, cruel in war, and cannibals, or devourers of human fle&s;h; but the&s;e &s;tories are generally looked upon as fic|tions of the Portugue&s;e, to ju&s;tify their cruel and inhuman treatment of them.</P>
<P>It is &s;aid, they believe in certain invi&s;ible beings, the di&s;pen&s;ers of good and evil, the rewarders and puni&s;hers of virtue and vice; and their notion with re&s;pect to a future &s;tate is, that after death they &s;hall vi&s;it their ance&s;tors, dwelling beyond the An|des; but they have no temples. Their prie&s;ts practi&s;e the &s;ame craft as tho&s;e in more civilized nations: they make them believe, that if they bring them offerings, tho&s;e invi&s;ible beings, who give them food and all the good things they enjoy, will
<PB N="452" REF="4530">
pro&s;per their affairs; but if they neglect this, &s;ome dreadful calamity will overtake them.</P>
<P>As to government, they are &s;aid to have their ca|ciques or chiefs, who admini&s;ter ju&s;tice to the peo|ple in time of peace, and command them in their expeditions again&s;t their enemies; their arms be|ing bows, arrows, wooden clubs or &s;words, and &s;hields. Their towns have no walls or fortifica|tions; and their method of carrying on war is chiefly by ambu&s;cades, &s;udden unexpected attacks, and incur&s;ions.</P>
<P>The Portugue&s;e di&s;covered this country in the year 1500; but did not plant it till the year 1549, when they fixed them&s;elves at the Bay of All Saints, and built the city of St. Salvador. The French al&s;o made &s;ome attempts to plant colonies upon this coa&s;t; but were driven from thence by the Portugue&s;e, who remained in Bra&s;il almo&s;t without a rival, till the year 1623: at that time, being under the dominion of the king of Spain, with whom the United Provinces were at war, the Dutch We&s;t-India company invaded Bra&s;il, and &s;ubdued the northern provinces. But the Dutch were entirely driven out of Bra&s;il in 1654: however, the We&s;t-In|dia company &s;till continuing their preten&s;ions to Bra&s;il, and committing depredations on the Portu|gue&s;e at &s;ea, the latter agreed, in 1661, to pay the Dutch eight tons of gold, to relinqui&s;h their claim to that country, which was accepted; and the Por|tugue&s;e have remained in peaceable po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it ever &s;ince.</P>

<HEAD>AMAZONIA.</HEAD>
<P>This country obtained the name of Amazonia, or the Country of the Amazons, from the Spaniards &s;eeing, when they fir&s;t entered the river, great num|bers of women on the banks of it with arms in their
<PB N="453" REF="4540">
hands; but the&s;e, it afterwards appeared, they carried only to ea&s;e their hu&s;bands, as they do the baggage in all their expeditions. The river of the Amazons is one of the large&s;t in the world, and is &s;aid to ri&s;e in the Cordilleras, eight or ten leagues ea&s;t of Quito; but, as others will have it, from the Lake Laurio|cha, near Guanaco in Peru, increa&s;ing &s;o, as it ad|vances towards the Atlantic, into which it di&s;|charges it&s;elf by eighty-four channels, that it is &s;e|veral leagues broad, and from thirty to forty fa|thom deep, five hundred leagues from its mouths, which take in a &s;pace of fifty or &s;ixty leagues, between Cape North, on the coa&s;t of Guiana, and Cape Laparate, on the coa&s;t of Bra&s;il. A great many rivers fall into it on both &s;ides, of which the Rio Negro, Xanxa, and Maranhon, are the chief, or among the chief. Taking in all the windings and turnings, it is computed to run five thou&s;and miles, from its &s;pring-head to its mouth; and, like all other rivers between the tropics, over|flows the country in the rainy &s;ea&s;on.</P>
<P>Amazonia is bounded by Terra-Firma on the north; by Bra&s;il, and the Atlantic Ocean, on the ea&s;t; by another part of Bra&s;il, and La Plata, on the &s;outh; and by Peru and Quito on the we&s;t; but little is known of it, except along the banks of the river, and the we&s;t frontiers of the Portu|gue&s;e colonies in Bra&s;il.</P>
<P>The celebrated M. Condamine made a voyage down the River of Amazons not a great many years ago, and has publi&s;hed a very entertaining journal of that adventure; to which we mu&s;t refer the reader, not having room here to epitomize it.</P>
<P>Neither Spaniards, Portugue&s;e, nor any other European nation have yet made any &s;ettlements in this country; &s;o that the Indians remain a free people, not &s;ubject to any foreign dominion. The air is cooler here than could be well expected &s;o
<PB N="454" REF="4550">
near the equator, which proceeds from the heavy rains, that occa&s;ion the rivers to overflow their banks one half of the year; and from the cloudy weather, and &s;hortne&s;s of the days, which never exceed twelve hours. A bri&s;k ea&s;terly wind al&s;o cools the air, which blows from the Atlantic O|cean quite through the country, &s;o &s;trong, that ve&s;|&s;els are thereby enabled to &s;ail again&s;t the &s;tream, and perform a voyage up the River of Amazons al|mo&s;t as &s;oon as down it, which requires eight or ten months. Here are terrible &s;torms of thunder and lightning, during the time of the rains.</P>
<P>The face of the country is &s;aid to be very beau|tiful, and the &s;oil fertile, producing cocoa-nuts, ananas or pine apples, guavas, bananas, and other tropical fruits; cedar, iron-wood, &s;o called from its weight and den&s;ity, red wood, oak, ebony, logwood, and many other &s;orts of dying woods and drugs; together with tobacco, cotton, &s;ugar, maiz, ca&s;&s;avi root, yams, potatoes, &s;ar&s;aparilla, and canela, or &s;purious cinnamon.</P>
<P>They have &s;tore of excellent honey, balm, wild fowl, and veni&s;on, in their woods, which al&s;o abound with tigers, wild boars, buffaloes, &amp;c. The honey is exqui&s;ite, and the balm good again&s;t all wounds. Parrots are as numerous here as pigeons in Eng|land, and as good meat. They have va&s;t numbers of fi&s;h of all &s;orts in the rivers and lakes; and, among others, manatees or &s;ea-cows, that are am|phibious, and feed on the banks; and tortoi&s;es, of a large &s;ize and delicate ta&s;te; but the fi&s;hers mu&s;t be upon their guard again&s;t crocodiles, alligators, and water-&s;erpents.</P>
<P>The natives, like almo&s;t all the Americans, are of a good &s;tature, have hand&s;ome features, long black hair, and copper complexions. They are reported to have a ta&s;te for the imitative arts, e&s;pe|cially &s;culpture and painting, and make good me|chanics.
<PB N="455" REF="4560">
Their cordage is made of the barks of trees, their &s;ails of cotton, their hatchets of tor|toi&s;e-&s;hells or hard &s;tones, their chi&s;&s;els, planes, and wimbles, of the teeth and horns of wild bea&s;ts, and their canoes are hollowed trees. They &s;pin and weave them&s;elves cotton garments; and their hou&s;es or huts are of wood, thatch, and clay. Their arms, in general, are darts and javelins, bows, and arrows, with targets of cane or fi&s;h-&s;kins. They are &s;uch good archers, that they kill fi&s;h in the wa|ter with their arrows, which they eat without bread or &s;alt. The &s;everal nations are governed by their chiefs or caciques; for it is ob&s;ervable, that the monarchical form of government hath prevail|ed almo&s;t univer&s;ally, both among the antient and modern barbarians, as requiring a le&s;s refined policy than the republican &s;y&s;tem. The regalia by which the chiefs are di&s;tingui&s;hed are, a crown of parrots feathers, a chain of lions teeth or claws about their middle, and a wooden &s;word in their hand. Both &s;exes &s;ometimes wear mantles of the &s;kins of bea&s;ts, or cotton, but generally go naked. In &s;ome nations the men thru&s;t pieces of cane through the fore&s;kin of their pudenda, their ears, and under lips, and hang gla&s;s beads at the gri&s;tle of their no&s;es, which bob to and fro when they &s;peak; but in others, they wear plates of gold at their ears and no&s;trils. All the&s;e nations allow of polygamy, or a plurality of wives and concubines; and the women here, as in the other American nations, do the mo&s;t labo|rious work. They wor&s;hip the images of their an|tient heroes, or &s;ubordinate deities; but we hear of no temples, or orders of prie&s;ts among them.</P>
<P>The Je&s;uits, before their expul&s;ion from the Spani&s;h and Portugue&s;e dominions, are &s;aid to have made a con&s;iderable progre&s;s in convert|ing the natives; but whether any of them &s;till continue here, or have quitted the country,
<PB N="456" REF="4570">
and given place to other orders, we cannot pretend to &s;ay.</P>
<P>Several voyages have been made up and down the River of Amazon, both by Spaniards and Portugue&s;e, who were &s;ent to make di&s;coveries; from whom, and the Je&s;uits, all our knowledge of the country is derived. Of the Spaniards, the chief are, Gonzalo Pizarro, brother of the marquis, who conquered Peru and Orellana; and of the Portugue&s;e, Texeira.</P>

<HEAD>GUIANA, or CARIBEANA.</HEAD>
<P>Guiana, or Caribeana, is bounded on the ea&s;t and north by the Atlantic Ocean, and the river Oroonoko; on the &s;outh by the country of the Amazons; and on the we&s;t by the provinces of Grenada and New-Andalu&s;ia, in Terra-Firma, from which it is &s;eparated both on the we&s;t and north, by the river Orconoko. It extends above twelve hundred miles from the north-ea&s;t to the &s;outh-we&s;t, that is, from the mouth of the river Oroo|noko to the mouth of the River of Amazons, and near &s;ix hundred in the contrary direction.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t geopraphers divide it into two parts, call|ing the country along the coa&s;t Caribeana Proper, and the interior country Guiana Proper: the la&s;t is al&s;o &s;tiled El Dorado by the Spaniards, on account of the immen&s;e quantity of gold it is &s;uppo&s;ed to contain.</P>
<P>The Portugue&s;e, French, and Dutch, have all &s;ettlements along the coa&s;t. What lies &s;outh of Cape North belongs to the fir&s;t of the&s;e nations; the coa&s;t between Cape North and Cape Orange is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the natives; French Guiana, Old Cayenne, or Equinoctial France, extends from Cape Orange, about two hundred and forty miles
<PB N="457" REF="4580">
along the coa&s;t, to the river Marani, where the Dutch territory begins, and extends to the mouth of the Oroonoko.</P>
<P>Along the coa&s;t the land is low, mar&s;hy, and &s;ubject to inundations in the rainy &s;ea&s;on, from a multitude of rivers which de&s;cend from the in|land mountains. Hence it is, that the atmo&s;phere is &s;uffocating hot, moi&s;t, and unhealthful, e&s;pecially where the woods have not been cleared away. In|deed, the Europeans are forced to live in the mo&s;t di&s;agreeable &s;ituations, and fix their colonies at the mouths of the rivers, amid&s;t &s;tinking mar&s;hes, and the putrid ooze of &s;alt mora&s;&s;es, for the con|veniency of exportation and importation.</P>
<P>The chief &s;ettlements of the French in Guiana are in the I&s;le of Cayenne, which lies a hundred miles we&s;t of Cape Orange, at the mouth of a river of the &s;ame name. It is about &s;eventeen leagues in com|pa&s;s, well wooded and watered, admirably culti|vated, and extremely fertile in &s;ugar, tobacco, maiz, herbage, and the nece&s;&s;aries of life; but the French fort at the bottom of the harbour is wholly &s;up|plied with fre&s;h water by rain, which is pre&s;erved in large ci&s;terns. At the ea&s;ternmo&s;t point of the i&s;land is the town and fort of St, Lewis. The town contains above two hundred hou&s;es, occupied by mechanics and trade&s;men, and the fort has a good garri&s;on. Clo&s;e by the fort al&s;o is &s;ecure an|choring for a great number of &s;hipping, in all &s;ea|&s;ons of the year. The French fir&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hed them&s;elves in this i&s;land, and the neighbouring con|tinent, in the year 1635, under the conduct of Mr. Bretigny, who lo&s;t his life by the hand of the na|tives. This unlucky accident reduced the colony to the greate&s;t di&s;tre&s;s; but they bravely defended them&s;elves again&s;t numerous armies of Indians, till the arrival of a reinforcement. However, they
<PB N="458" REF="4590">
afterwards abandoned this i&s;land, and the Engli&s;h took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; but the French returning, obliged them to quit it; who were, in their turn, expelled by the Dutch, under the command of admiral Binks. The Dutch held their conque&s;t but a &s;hort time; for they were driven out by the count d'E&s;|trees, the French admiral, the &s;ame year; &s;ince which time it has been held by France, though the Hollanders have made &s;ome attempts to re|cover their lo&s;s.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to Dutch Guiana, we &s;hall fir&s;t pre&s;ent our readers with a &s;hort extract of what is mo&s;t curious in an account of that country, lately publi&s;hed by a gentleman, who re&s;ided &s;everal years at Surinam, as a phy&s;ician, and then add what fur|ther &s;eems nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>Guiana, according to that gentleman, was fir&s;t di&s;covered by Columbus in 1498. It lies between the 7&deg;. of north, and the 5&deg;. of &s;outh latitude, and be|tween the 53 and 60&deg;. of longitude we&s;t from Lon|don. It is bounded on the north and ea&s;t by the Atlantic; on the we&s;t by the rivers Oroonoko and Negroe; and on the &s;outh by the river of Amazons.</P>
<P>It is now divided between the Spaniards, Dutch, French, and Portugue&s;e; but except its &s;ea-coa&s;t, and lands adjacent to its rivers, it has hitherto re|mained unknown to all but its original natives; and even of the&s;e, it is only in the Dutch territories that foreigners have any knowledge; for tho&s;e of the Spaniards, French, and Portugue&s;e, are in|acce&s;&s;ible to them.</P>
<P>This country, on account of the diver&s;ity and fertility of its &s;oil, and of its vicinity to the equator, which pa&s;&s;es through it, affords almo&s;t all the pro|ductions of the different American countries be|tween the tropics, be&s;ides a variety peculiar to it&s;elf.</P>
<P><PB N="459" REF="4600">
Dutch Guiana was formerly the property of the Engli&s;h, who made &s;ettlements at Surinam, where a kind of corrupt Engli&s;h is &s;till &s;poken by the ne|groes. The Dutch took it in the reign of Charles the &s;econd; and it was ceded to them by treaty in 1674, in exchange for what they had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in the province now called New York.</P>
<P>The land for fifty miles up the country from the &s;ea coa&s;t is flat; and, during the rainy &s;ea&s;ons, covered two feet high with water. This renders it inconceivably fertile, the earth, for twelve inches deep, being a &s;tratum of perfect manure: an at|tempt was once made to carry &s;ome of it to Bar|badoes; but the wood-ants &s;o much injured the ve&s;&s;el, that it was never repeated. The exce&s;&s;ive richne&s;s of the &s;oil is a di&s;advantage, for the canes are too luxuriant to make good &s;ugar; and, there|fore, during the fir&s;t and &s;econd crop, are con|verted into rum.</P>
<P>There are &s;ome trees on this part, but they are &s;mall and low, con&s;i&s;ting chiefly of a &s;mall &s;pecies of palm, intermixed with a leaf near thirty feet long, and three feet wide, which grows in clu&s;ters called a Troelie; and, at the edges of running|water, with mangroves.</P>
<P>Farther inward the country ri&s;es, and the &s;oil, though &s;till fertile, is le&s;s durable. It is covered with fore&s;ts of valuable timber, that are always green; and there are &s;ome &s;andy-hills, though no mountains; in the French territories, however, there are mountains, according to the report of the Indians, for they have never been vi&s;ited by any other people.</P>
<P>In this country the heat is &s;eldom di&s;agreeable: the trade-winds by day, the land breezes in the evening, and the invariable length of the nights, with gentle dews, refre&s;h the air, and render it temperate and &s;alubrious. There are two wet &s;ea|&s;ons,
<PB N="460" REF="4610">
and two dry, of three months each, in every year; and, during more than a month in each wet &s;ea&s;on, the rain is ince&s;&s;ant. The dry &s;ea&s;ons com|mence &s;ix weeks befor&eacute; the equinoxes, and con|tinue &s;ix weeks after. The wet &s;ea&s;ons are more whole&s;ome than the dry, becau&s;e the rains keep the waters that cover the low lands, next the &s;ea, fre&s;h and in motion; but during the dry &s;ea&s;on it &s;tagnates, and, as it wa&s;tes, becomes putrid, &s;end|ing up very unwhole&s;ome exhalations. Blo&s;&s;oms, green and ripe fruit, are to be found upon the &s;ame tree in every part of the year. There are &s;ome fine red and white agates in Guiana, which remain untouched; and mines of gold and &s;ilver, which the Dutch will not &s;uffer to be wrought.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides many trees and plants common to it with other countries, and which have been often and accurately de&s;cribed, Guiana produces many pecu|liar to it&s;elf, particularly the &s;imaraba-tree, the bark of the roots of which is e&s;teemed a &s;pecific in dy|&s;entries; the caruna, a &s;mall poi&s;onous nut, which the Indians reduce to powder, and conceal under their nails at their meetings, when they intend to re|venge an injury, till they can put it into the drink of their victim; the woorara, a &s;pecies of the nibbees, called by the Spaniards bejucos, which are a &s;ort of ligneous cordage, &s;ome flat, &s;ome round. The round nibbees are innoxious; the flat poi&s;onous. The woorara is a flat nibbee, u&s;ed by the Indians in a compo&s;ition to poi&s;on their arrows.</P>
<P>There are &s;ome animals al&s;o peculiar to Guiana, particularly the Iaubba. This animal is amphi|bious, and about the &s;ize of a pig four months old. The head is &s;haped like that of a pug-dog, and its feet are like a dog's, but it has no tail. The &s;pecies of monkies in Guiana are innumerable. Perhaps their kinds multiply by a promi&s;cuous mixture, as dogs do among us. There are bats
<PB N="461" REF="4620">
here twice as large as ours, and without a tail. Mo&s;t people in Guiana &s;leep in hammocks, as more &s;ecure from &s;erpents and poi&s;onous in&s;ects; but this does not &s;ecure them from the bats, which approach any part of the body that is uncovered, generally the feet, open a vein, and &s;uck the blood till they are &s;atisfied. There is al&s;o peculiar to Guiana a large venomous toad, called the pipa. Its young are bred in the back of the male, where the female depo&s;ites the eggs.</P>
<P>There is a great variety of beautiful birds in Guiana, but mo&s;t of them are common to it with &s;ome other countries, and have been often de&s;cribed. Several per&s;ons in the Dutch colony employ them|&s;elves, and their &s;laves, in killing and pre&s;erving birds for the cabinets of Europe.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t of the fi&s;hes of Guiana al&s;o are common to it with other countries; among the re&s;t is the torpedo, or numbing-fi&s;h.</P>
<P>Guiana abounds in &s;erpents of various kinds. There is one &s;ort not venomous, that mea&s;ures &s;ometimes above thirty feet in length, and three in circumference. It has a taper tail, armed with two claws, like tho&s;e of a dunghill cock. Small deer have been found in their &s;tomach. There are al&s;o &s;ome of tho&s;e called amphis baena.</P>
<P>The in&s;ects of Guiana are innumerable, owing to the con&s;tant warmth and humidity of the cli|mate; but the mo&s;t remarkable are &s;uch as are well known, and have been often de&s;cribed.</P>
<P>The inhabitants of Guiana are either natives, who are of a reddi&s;h brown, or negroes and Euro|peans, or a mixed progeny of the&s;e in various com|binations. The natives are divided into different tribes, more or le&s;s enlightened, and poli&s;hed, as they are more or le&s;s remote from the settlements of the Europeans. They allow polygamy, and have no divi&s;ion of lands. The men go to war,
<PB N="462" REF="4630">
hunt, and fi&s;h, and the women look after dome&s;tic concerns, &s;pin, weave, in their fa&s;hion, and look after the planting ca&s;&s;ava and manive, the only things which in this country are cultivated by the natives. Their arms are bows and arrows, &s;hort poi&s;oned arrows, blown through a reed, which they u&s;e in hunting, and clubs made of a heavy wood called iron wood. They eat the dead bodies of tho&s;e that are &s;lain in war, and &s;ell for &s;laves tho&s;e they take pri&s;oners; their wars being chiefly undertaken to furni&s;h the European plan|tations. All the different tribes go naked. On particular occa&s;ions they wear caps of feathers; but, as cold is wholly unknown, they cover no part but that which di&s;tingui&s;hes the &s;ex. They are chear|ful, humane, and friendly, but timid, except when heated by liquor, and drunkenne&s;s is a very com|mon vice among them.</P>
<P>Their hou&s;es con&s;i&s;t of four &s;takes &s;et up in a qua|drangular form, with cro&s;s poles, bound together by &s;lit nibbees, and covered with the large leaves called troelies. Their life is ambulatory, and their hou&s;e, which is put up and taken down in a few hours, is all they have to carrry with them. When they remove from place to place, which, as they inhabit the banks of rivers, they do by water in &s;mall canoes, a few ve&s;&s;els of clay made by the women, a flat &s;tone, on which they bake their bread, and a rough &s;tone, on which they grate the roots of the ca&s;&s;ava, a hammock and a hatchet, are all their furniture and uten&s;ils; mo&s;t of them however have a bit of looking-gla&s;s framed in pa|per, and a comb.</P>
<P>Their poi&s;oned arrows are made of &s;plinters of a hard heavy wood, called cacario; they are about twelve inches long, and &s;omewhat thicker than a coar&s;e knitting needle; one end is formed into a &s;harp point; round the other is wound &s;ome cot|ton,
<PB N="463" REF="4640">
to make it fit the bore of the reed, through which it is to be blown. They will blow the&s;e ar|rows forty yards with ab&s;olute certainty of hitting the mark, and with force enough to draw blood, which is certain and immediate death. Again&s;t this poi|&s;on no antidote is known. The Indians never u&s;e the&s;e poi&s;oned arrows in war, but in hunting only, and chiefly again&s;t monkies; the fle&s;h of an ani|mal thus killed may be &s;afely eaten, and even the poi&s;on it&s;elf &s;wallowed with impunity.</P>
<P>All the tribes of Indians in Dutch Guiana believe the exi&s;tence of one &s;upreme God, the au|thor of nature, and of inferior beings, always di&s;|po&s;ed to mi&s;chief, exactly &s;uch as our devils. They have conjurers among them, who pretend to have an intercour&s;e with the&s;e devils, and an influ|ence over them; and have ceremonies much like what is called paw-wawing in other parts of Ame|rica, which has been often de&s;cribed: they &s;eem rather to wi&s;h than believe a future &s;tate; and as they &s;uffer no anxiety about the next hour, they &s;uffer &s;till le&s;s about the next life.</P>
<P>They bury their dead naked: when the ceremo|ny is over they drown their &s;orrows in a drunken fea&s;t; and when the body has lain &s;o long in the earth, that the fle&s;h is &s;uppo&s;ed to be rotten. The bones are taken out and di&s;tributed among the re|lations: this ceremony is al&s;o attended with a drunken fea&s;t. The ceremony of marriage is nothing more. Though polygamy is allowed, it is not often practi&s;ed: but when the wife is grown old and di&s;agreeable, a girl about eight years old is taken into the hou&s;e, who acts as a &s;ervant in dome&s;tic employments, till about eleven, and being then marriageable becomes a wife.</P>
<P>The Indians here have no chief; yet, living in a &s;tate in which artificial wants have not produced a general oppo&s;ition of intere&s;t, and where natural
<PB N="464" REF="4650">
wants are ea&s;ily &s;upplied, their vices are but few. Continence before marriage is not con&s;idered as a virtue; a man cares not whether the woman he marries is a virgin or not; but no injury is &s;o &s;ure|ly revenged as the infidelity of a wife.</P>
<P>Nothing is cultivated here by the natives but plantains, ca&s;&s;ava, and yams; and one month's cultivation is &s;ufficient for all the&s;e. The men are all hunters, and they can always find game or fi&s;h, if they prefer it, without danger or toil. They dre&s;s it by boiling, either in water or in the juice of ca&s;|&s;ava, and &s;ea&s;on it very high with kyan, or red pep|per. The only &s;et time of eating is the evening, when they return from hunting; in general, they eat whenever they are hungry. They &s;carce know &s;alt; but &s;ometimes pre&s;erve animal food by &s;moke-drying it. Their drink is water or a fer|mented liquor, prepared from the plantain, called pievoree; when they have plenty of this, they are continually drunk, &s;o that their indolence and im|providence, by preventing a con&s;tant &s;upply, be|come public and private ble&s;&s;ings.</P>
<P>As the &s;upplying the wants of nature in &s;o fer|tile and delightful a country takes up but a &s;mall portion of the time, they fill up the intervals by various amu&s;ements: they bathe and &s;wim in the rivers, in large companies, &s;everal times a day, without di&s;tinction of &s;ex; and they &s;wim &s;o well, that they may almo&s;t be reckoned among amphi|bious animals. At other times they vi&s;it each other, and are mutually entertained with the &s;im|ple occurrences of their lives, and a great variety of fables, which are merry, &s;ignificant, and moral. Sometimes they dance, and frequently bur&s;t into immoderate laughter; and &s;ometimes they recline indolently in their hammocks, where they not on|ly &s;leep, but eat, conver&s;e, and play, blow a kind

<P>The women &s;uffer nothing in child-$Word$, which is attended either with danger or $Span$. The mother and child, immediately after $Span$, are plunged into the water, and the next day the re|turns to her dome&s;tic employment, as if nothing had happened. The children are fed, and during their infancy no other care is taken of them; none are &s;ickly, or deformed: the boys, as they grow up, attend the father in hunting, and the girls a&s;&s;i&s;t the mother. In old age, they become wrinkled; but never either bald or grey. As they have no me|thod of computing time to any number of years, their age cannot be a&s;certained; but there is &s;uffi|cient rea&s;on to conclude, that their lives are long.</P>
<P>In all their traffic with each other, or with Eu|ropeans, they e&s;timate every thing by their pre&s;ent want of it; they will at one time demand a hatchet, for what at another time they will exchange for a fi&s;h-hook.</P>
<P>This blamele&s;s and happy people live together upon terms of perfect equality, having no di&s;tinc|tion but of age, or per&s;onal merit; neither have they any divi&s;ion of property; each amicably parti|cipates the ample ble&s;&s;ings of a delightful and ex|ten&s;ive country; envy, fraud, and violence are pre|cluded, natural de&s;ires are immediately and innocent|ly indulged, and government rendered wholly unne|ce&s;&s;ary. Thus far the abovementioned gentleman.</P>
<P>The &s;tates of Holland, to whom the colony of Surinam originally belonged, made it over to the Dutch We&s;t-India company; but that company not being in a conditon to &s;end thither the nece&s;&s;a|ry &s;upplies, made over a third part of their &s;hare to the magi&s;trates of Am&s;terdam, and another third part to Mynheer Van Aar&s;ens, lord of Sommel&s;|dyk. Hence this colony is the joint property of
<PB N="466" REF="4670">
the We&s;t-India company, the city of Am&s;terdam, and the lord of Sommel&s;dyk; but the &s;overeignty of it belongs to the States-General. According|ly, of the board of directors at Am&s;terdam, by which this colony is governed, five are cho&s;en by the magi&s;trates of that city, four by the We&s;t-In|dia company, and one by the lord of Sommel&s;dyk; but the governor mu&s;t be approved by the States-General, and take an oath to them, as well as to the directors.</P>
<P>The colony is now in the mo&s;t flouri&s;hing con|dition; and a con&s;iderable trade is carried on in &s;ugar, tobacco, gums, dying drugs and woods, cof|fee, cotton, flax, and &s;kins; not only with Eu|rope, but the We&s;t-India i&s;lands, e&s;pecially the Bri|ti&s;h. Be&s;ides Surinam, the capital, there are no le&s;s than &s;even or eight inland towns belonging to the colony all rich, populous, and commercial, and about five hundred plantations.</P>
<P>Surinam, which gives name to the adjacent country for a hundred miles round, &s;tands within the river of the &s;ame name, in 6&deg;. 16&prime;. north lati|tude.

<P>To the north-we&s;t of the colony of Surinam lies that of Berbice, which takes its name from a river, and is al&s;o governed by directors, cho&s;en from among the proprietors in Holland, who, in 1732, obtained a privilege from the States-General to render the navigation to this colony free, and al&s;o to levy cer|tain duties, both on the inhabitants and &s;hips going out or in.</P>

<HEAD>JAMAICA.</HEAD>
<P>Jamaica, the large&s;t of all the Briti&s;h We&s;t-In|dian I&s;lands, extends from 75&deg;. 57&prime;. to 78&deg;. 37&prime;. we&s;t longitude, and from 17&deg;. 48&prime;. to 18&deg;. 50&prime;. of north latitude; being about one hundred and &s;ixty miles in length, from Point Negril, on the we&s;t, to Point Morant, on the ea&s;t; and &s;eventy from Portland Pitch, on the &s;outh, to Gallina Point, on the north, where it is broade&s;t; but be|ing
<PB N="468" REF="4690">
of an oval form, it grows narrower towards each end. It lies near four thou&s;and five hundred miles &s;outh-we&s;t of England, one hundred &s;outh of Cuba, and &s;eventy we&s;t of Hi&s;paniola, contain|ing between four and five millions of acres.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the air, there is no country be|tween the tropics where the heat is more moderate, being con&s;tantly cooled with refre&s;hing breezes, frequent rains, and nightly dews: however, it is unwhole&s;ome, e&s;pecially on the &s;ea coa&s;t, and ex|ce&s;&s;ively hot in the mornings all the year round, till about eight o'clock, when the &s;ea-breeze begins, increa&s;ing gradually till about twelve, when it is commonly &s;tronge&s;t, and la&s;ts till two or three, when it begins to die away till about five o'clock, when it is quite &s;pent, and returns no more till next morning. About eight in the evening begins a land-breeze, which blows four leagues into the &s;ea, and continues increa&s;ing till twelve at night, after which it decrea&s;es till four in the morning, when it cea&s;es, and returns again at night. The &s;ea-breeze is &s;tronger at &s;ome times than at others, and more &s;o near the coa&s;t than within land; where|as, it is ju&s;t the rever&s;e with the land-breeze. Sometimes the &s;ea-breeze blows day and night for a week or two. In December, January, and Fe|bruary, the north wind blows furiou&s;ly, checking the growth of the canes, and all other vegetables, on the north &s;ide of the i&s;land; but the mountains cover the &s;outh &s;ide from them. Though it often rains at other times, yet the months of May and October bring the heavie&s;t and mo&s;t la&s;ting rains; and the ea&s;t and we&s;t parts of the i&s;land, contain|ing large tracts of inclo&s;ed ground, are more &s;ub|ject to &s;torms of wind and rain, and more unwhole|&s;ome than the &s;outh and north. The &s;outh winds bring the mo&s;t rain; no rains are la&s;ting on the &s;outh &s;ide of the i&s;land, that come from the land.
<PB N="469" REF="4700">
Fro&s;t and &s;now are never &s;een here; but &s;ometimes large hail, e&s;pecially on the mountains, where the air is always cooler than in the low lands. The land-wind blowing in the nights, and the &s;ea-breeze in the day time, no &s;hip can come into port but in the day-time, nor go out but &s;oon after day-break.</P>
<P>The dews here are &s;o great within land, that the water drops from the leaves of the trees in the morning as if it had rained; but there are &s;eldom any fogs, at lea&s;t in the plain or &s;andy places near the &s;ea.</P>
<P>Earthquakes are very frequent in Jamaica; the inhabitants expect one every year. A re|markable one happened in 1668, which was felt all over the i&s;land. It was ob&s;erved, that the ground ro&s;e like the &s;ea in waves, as the earth|quake pa&s;&s;ed along; but this was nothing to that which happened at Port Royal in 1692, by which that town was almo&s;t &s;wallowed up.</P>
<P>As to the &s;oil, and face of the i&s;land there is a ridge of hills, called the Blue Mountains, that runs from ea&s;t to we&s;t, through it, furrowed by deep gullies on the north and &s;outh &s;ides, made by the violent rains, which &s;all almo&s;t every day on tho&s;e mountains, the tops of which are crowned with different kinds of trees, cedar, lignum vitae, mahogany, and the like, which render them equal|ly plea&s;ant and profitable to the inhabitants. Se|veral fine rivers al&s;o, &s;tored with fi&s;h, and navi|gable by canoes, take their ri&s;e from them. A lower ridge runs parallel to the greater, and the vallies or &s;avannahs are exceeding level, with|out &s;tones, fit for pa&s;ture, and fruitful, when cleared of wood, e&s;pecially on the &s;outh &s;ide of the i&s;land. After the rains, or &s;ea&s;ons, as they are called, their &s;avannahs are very plea&s;ant: but, after long droughts, look quite parched and burnt up. One may ride many miles in them without meet|ing
<PB N="470" REF="4710">
the lea&s;t a&s;cent. They produce &s;uch quanti|ties of gra&s;s that the inhabitants are &s;ometimes forced to burn it. Notwith&s;tanding the many rivers and lakes, water in &s;ome places is very &s;carce, and in others &s;o mixed with &s;and and &s;e|diment, that it is not fit for u&s;e, till purified for &s;ome days in earthen jars; and many cattle, in &s;ome years, peri&s;h for want of water. There are &s;everal &s;alt &s;prings in the i&s;land, which form a &s;alt river, and &s;everal lakes. Near the &s;ea, as at Port Royal, the well water is bracki&s;h, and un|whol&s;ome. Though the &s;oil of Jamaica in ge|neral is exceeding fertile, yet it is thought not one fourth of the &s;ugar ground upon the i&s;land is cultivated: even the grounds lying near the ri|vers and the &s;ea are in many places over-run with wood, in&s;omuch that a planter who has patented three or four thou&s;and acres, has &s;eldom above five hundred well cultivated. One acre, in &s;ome places, has been known to yield &s;everal hog&s;heads of &s;ugar.</P>
<P>The principal vegetables and produce of the i&s;land, be&s;ides &s;ugar and rum, are cacao, of which chocolate is made, cotton, coffee, indigo, pimento, commonly called cod or Jamaica pepper, oranges, lemons, citrons, palms, pomegranates, &s;haddocks, mamies, &s;our-&s;ops, papao, pine apples, cu&s;tard apples, &s;tar apples, prickly pears, Alicada pears, melons, plantains, and guavas; dying woods, gums, and medicinal drugs, as guaiacum, China root, &s;ar&s;a|parilla, ca&s;&s;ia fi&s;tula, tamarinds, venellas. Jamaica al&s;o produces &s;ome tobacco, but of a coar&s;e kind, and cultivated only for the &s;ake of the negroes, who are fond of it; Indian and Guinea corn, with peas of various kinds, but none re&s;embling tho&s;e of Great Britain, except tho&s;e which are reared with great care and tenderne&s;s in gardens, toge|ther with cabbages and a variety of roots, par|ticularly
<PB N="471" REF="4720">
ca&s;&s;ava, of which they make bread, yams, and potatoes.</P>
<P>The woods are &s;tored with berries; but apples, and tho&s;e fruits that are more peculiar to cold coun|tries, thrive but poorly in Jamaica. Be&s;ides the productions we have mentioned, many others may be found in the accounts of the naturali&s;ts, who have treated of the i&s;land, particularly the manchineel tree, which bears a beautiful but poi&s;onous apple, and the wild cinnamon, which is e&s;teemed a &s;overeign remedy for di&s;pelling wind, and a&s;&s;i&s;ting dige&s;tion.</P>
<P>After all, the &s;ugar cane is the glory and chief &s;upport of Jamaica. This plant is thought to have been known to the Romans, and to have been ori|ginally a native of the Canary I&s;lands, from whence the Spaniards and Portugue&s;e, after they began to trade with Africa, carried it to their own countries, and al&s;o to their Ea&s;t and We&s;t India &s;ettlements.</P>
<P>The con&s;umption of &s;ugar in Great Britain, one year with another, has been computed at &s;eventy thou&s;and hog&s;heads, each containing twelve hundred weight, and all our colonies are &s;uppo&s;ed to produce, on an average, eight hundred and fifty thou&s;and hog&s;heads of &s;ugar yearly. It is computed that there are three hundred &s;ail of &s;hips &s;ent every year to our &s;ugar colonies from Great-Britain, which are navigated by four thou&s;and five hundred &s;ea|men; that the frieght of the &s;ugars brought hither amount to a hundred and &s;eventy thou&s;and pounds &s;terling per annum, and the duty, commi&s;&s;ion, &amp;c. to little le&s;s than two hundred thou&s;and more. As to the exports from hence to our &s;ugar colonies, it appeared by the cu&s;tom-hou&s;e books, in 1726, that all the Briti&s;h manufactures, exported to Bar|badoes, all the Leeward I&s;lands, and Jamaica, the latter of which generally takes as much for the Spa|ni&s;h trade, &amp;c. as all tho&s;e other i&s;lands, amounted
<PB N="472" REF="4730">
to two hundred and thirty-four thou&s;and, &s;even hundred and eighty-five pounds, &s;eventeen &s;hillings, &s;terling. We may venture to a&s;&s;ert, that they are a third more now.</P>
<P>The Jamaica &s;ugar is &s;aid to be the be&s;t of all our plantations, and made with the greate&s;t ea&s;e. There were about &s;ixty &s;ugar mills in Jamaica as long ago as 1670, which made about two million of pounds weight of &s;ugar; and it is &s;aid, they now make ten times as much as they did then. The Jamaica rum is e&s;teemed the be&s;t in the world, and is in the greate&s;t reque&s;t in England. We are told about four thou&s;and puncheons of it are exported yearly.</P>
<P>There are few colonies in America &s;o well &s;tocked with cattle as this: hor&s;es, a&s;&s;es, and mules, are very cheap; and there would have been numbers of horned cattle, had not the inhabitants, who mind planting much more than grazing, le&s;|&s;ened their &s;tock by their inattention; &s;o that, at pre&s;ent, they are &s;upplied with beef from the Briti&s;h colonies on the continent, whence they have al&s;o &s;alted pork and fi&s;h, flour, pea&s;e, &amp;c. Their &s;heep are large and fat, and their fle&s;h very good; but the wool, which is long and full of hairs, is worth nothing. Beef cannot be kept many days, though it be &s;alted, and fre&s;h beef is ready to cor|rupt in four or five hours. Butchers therefore al|ways kill in the morning, ju&s;t before day, and by &s;even o'clock the markets are over.</P>
<P>Ma&s;ters are obliged to furni&s;h their &s;ervants, both whites and blacks, with three pounds of &s;alt beef, pork, or fi&s;h, every week, be&s;ides ca&s;&s;avi bread, yams, and potatoes. Here are abundance of goats, rabbits and hogs, but no hares or deer. Of wild fowl their is a great variety, as ducks, teal, widgeons, gee&s;e, turkies, pidgeons, Guinea-hens, plover, flamingo's, &s;nipes, parrots, paroquets, and humming birds.</P>
<P><PB N="473" REF="4740">
The bays, roads, and rivers of Jamaica abound with excellent fi&s;h, of almo&s;t all the European and American kinds; but the tortoi&s;e is by much the mo&s;t valuable, both for its &s;hell and fi&s;h, the latter being accounted the mo&s;t delicious, and, at the &s;ame time, the mo&s;t whole&s;ome in all the In|dies. The manatee, or &s;ea-cow, which is often taken in calm bays, by the Indians, is reckoned extraordinary good eating.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the&s;e ordinary provi&s;ions, the racoon, a &s;mall quadruped, is eaten; rats are al&s;o &s;old by the dozen, and when they have been bred among the &s;ugar canes, are thought, by &s;ome people, very delicious food. Snakes and &s;erpents, and co&s;&s;i, a &s;ort of worms, are eaten by the Indians and ne|groes.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t common drink is water, or rum di|luted with water, and punch. Great quantities al&s;o of Madeira wine are drank, that wine having this particular quality, that it keeps better in a hot place, or expo&s;ed to the &s;un, than in a cool cellar: cyder, beer, and ale are al&s;o brought hither from the northern colonies. It is ob&s;erved that pa&s;&s;en|gers, when they come fir&s;t to Jamaica, &s;weat con|tinually in great drops, for three quarters of a year, yet they are not more dry than in England, nor even fainti&s;h.</P>
<P>This and all the other governments in the Briti&s;h American I&s;lands, are royal governments. The king appoints the governor and council, and the repre&s;entatives are cho&s;en by the freemen of every pari&s;h, and tho&s;e a&s;&s;emblies make laws, but they mu&s;t be confirmed by the court of England.</P>
<P>The inhabitants are either Engli&s;h, or of Engli&s;h extraction, born on the i&s;land: Indians, negroes, mulattos, or me&s;tize, or the de&s;cendants of them. The Engli&s;h, and tho&s;e of Engli&s;h extraction, may be thirty thou&s;and; the Indians are but few,
<PB N="474" REF="4750">
mo&s;t of the natives having been de&s;troyed by the Spaniards. The negroes on the i&s;land are about a hundred thou&s;and.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the militia there is generally a regiment of foot from Great-Britain here; and a &s;quadron of Briti&s;h men of war is u&s;ually &s;tationed at Port Royal, even in time of peace. Sir William Trelaw|ney, Bart. is the pre&s;ent governor and&mdash;Fore&s;t, <ABBR>e&s;q</ABBR> commodore of the &s;quadron. The principal part of the revenues accruing to the crown of Great-Britain from Jamaica, is the duty ari&s;ing from &s;ugar, rum, and mela&s;&s;es, imported from hence, which is very con&s;iderable.</P>
<P>The religion of the church of England is the e&s;tabli&s;hed religion in all the Briti&s;h i&s;lands; but there are yet no bi&s;hops; the bi&s;hop of London's commi&s;&s;ary is the principal eccle&s;ia&s;tic in the&s;e i&s;lands.</P>
<P>Jamaica is divided into nineteen pari&s;hes or precincts, the chief towns in which are St Jago de la Vega, or Spani&s;h Town, King&s;ton, Port-Pa&s;|&s;age, and Port-Royal.</P>
<P>St. Jago de la Vega, or Spani&s;h Town, &s;tands on the river Cobre, in a plea&s;ant valley. The hou&s;es, though but one &s;tory high, con&s;i&s;t of &s;eve|ral commodious apartments, all of them well fur|ni&s;hed and fini&s;hed with mahogony. Here the governor and mo&s;t of the principal people of the i&s;land re&s;ide, and the a&s;&s;emblies and courts of ju&s;|tice are held; in con&s;quence of which there are many coaches and chariots belonging to it, with plays, balls, concerts, and &s;uch like polite diver|&s;ions; but there is only one church and a chapel. Spani&s;h Town &s;ends three repre&s;entatives to the a&s;|&s;embly. Before the governor's hou&s;e is an exchange, to which the merchants and others repair to do bu&s;ine&s;s. The chief inhabitants often take an air|ing in a &s;avannah that lies clo&s;e by the town.

<P>King&s;ton, the large&s;t town in the i&s;land, &s;tands on the bay or harbour of Port-Royal, ten or twelve miles &s;outh ea&s;t of St. Jago, and five by water, but fifteen by land, from Port-Royal. It &s;tands com|modiou&s;ly for fre&s;h water, and all other conve|niencies of life, being about a mile long, and half a mile broad, with hand&s;ome regular &s;treets. The harbour is one of the mo&s;t commodious in Ame|rica. It is about three leagues broad in mo&s;t places, and &s;o deep that a &s;hip of &s;even hundred tons may lay clo&s;e to the &s;hore. and it can &s;afely contain a thou&s;and &s;ail. Its entrance is defended by Fort Charles, one of the &s;tronge&s;t belonging to the Engli&s;h i&s;lands, a battery of &s;ixty pieces of can|non, and a garri&s;on of regulars, maintained by the crown. The river Cobre, on which Spa|ni&s;h Town &s;tands, falls into this bay.</P>
<P>Port Royal, notwith&s;tanding the calamities that have befallen it, its hot and dry &s;ituation, and the want of fre&s;h water, &s;tones, and gra&s;s, hath been, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, rebuilt, and its commo|diou&s;ne&s;s hath tempted many to &s;ettle on the &s;eemingly devoted &s;pot, and run all ri&s;ks.</P>
<P>Port-Pa&s;&s;age, or Pa&s;&s;age Fort, is a &s;ea-port town, &s;even miles &s;outh-ea&s;t of St. Jago, at the mouth of the river Cobre, &s;o called, becau&s;e it is the greate&s;t thoroughfare in the i&s;land. The fort here mounts ten or twelve guns.</P>

<P>Barbadoes, the mo&s;t con&s;iderable of all the Briti&s;h &s;ugar i&s;lands next to Jamaica, one of the chief, and mo&s;t windwardly, except Tobago, of the Carib|bees, is &s;aid to lie ninety miles &s;outh-ea&s;t of Martini|co, and &s;eventy ea&s;t of St. Vincent; between 59&deg;. 50&prime;. and 60&deg;. 2&prime;. we&s;t of London; and between 12&deg;. 56&prime;. and 13&deg;. 16&prime;. north latitude; extending twenty-five miles from north to &s;outh, and fifteen from ea&s;t to we&s;t. The &s;uperficial content is about one hundred and &s;even thou&s;and acres.</P>
<P>The climate is hot, e&s;pecially for eight months in the year, but not unwhole&s;ome; for though there are no land breezes, there are others ari&s;ing from the &s;ea, which increa&s;e as the &s;un advances to, and abate as he declines from the meridian. A temperate regimen renders it as &s;afe to live in as any climate in Europe, &s;outh of Britain; and ac|cording to the opinion of many, as Britain it&s;elf. The days are very near equal, the &s;un ri&s;ing about &s;ix and &s;etting about &s;ix all the year round. The rains fall here as in other parts of the torrid zone, chiefly when the &s;un is vertical. The damps or dews are &s;o great in the night, that every bit of iron will &s;oon be eaten up with ru&s;t, if it be not in con&s;tant u&s;e. The twilights are &s;o &s;hort here, that it is dark three quarters of an hour after &s;un|&s;et. They have &s;ometimes hurricanes in autumn, by which the plantations &s;uffer greatly; but they are not &s;o frequent as in the neighbouring i&s;lands.</P>

Barbadoes is generally a plain level country, with &s;ome &s;mall hills; and the woods have been all cut down to make room for the plantations of &s;ugar-canes, which now take up almo&s;t the whole i&s;land, and render it the mo&s;t valuable plantation to Great-Britain, for its &s;ize, that it ever po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed. Notwith&s;tanding the &s;mallne&s;s of the i&s;land, its &s;oil is different, being in &s;ome places &s;andy and light, in others rich, and in others &s;pungy; but all of them cultivated, according to their &s;everal na|tures: &s;o that the i&s;land pre&s;ents to the eye the mo&s;t beautiful appearance of &s;pring, &s;ummer, and au|tumn, producing &s;ugar, rum, mola&s;&s;es, cotton, indigo, ginger, pine-apples, guavas, plantains, oranges, lemons, citrons, limes, or dwarf-lemons, aloes, tamarinds, mangroves, calaba&s;hes, cedars, cacao and cocoa-nuts, prickled-apples, pome|granates, papays, cu&s;tard-apples, with fig-trees, mangroves, calaba&s;hes, cedars, cabbage, ca&s;&s;ia, fi&s;tula, ma&s;tic, and bulley-trees. The citrons of Barbadoes afford the fine&s;t drams and &s;weetmeats; and the juice of the limes are the mo&s;t agreeable &s;ouring we know of; and great quantities are now imported into Great-Britain and Ireland.</P>
<P>The inhabitants have few orchards or gardens, becau&s;e they employ their lands in a more profita|ble culture; and they can bring Indian corn from North-America cheaper than it can be &s;old for, when growing upon the i&s;land.</P>
<P>As for animals, here are abundance of hogs, which are much finer eating than tho&s;e of Eng|land, oxen, cows, hor&s;es, a&s;&s;es, goats, monkeys, and racoons, with a few &s;heep and rabbits; but the mutton is inferior to that of England.</P>
<P>Of wild fowl here are teals, curlews, plovers, &s;nipes, wild pidgeons, wild-ducks, and a kind of bird called a man of war. The tame pidgeons, pullets, ducks, and poultry of all kinds, that are
<PB N="478" REF="4790">
bred in Barbadoes, have a fine flavour, and are accounted more delicious than tho&s;e of Europe.</P>
<P>In&s;ects are very numerous, but not venomous in Barbadoes, nor do either their &s;nakes or &s;corpions ever &s;ting.</P>
<P>The &s;urrounding &s;ea abounds with fi&s;h, &s;ome of which are almo&s;t peculiar to it&s;elf, as parrot-fi&s;h, &s;nappers, and grey-cavellos, tarbums, and coney|fi&s;h. Their mullets, lob&s;ters, and crabs, are excel|lent; and the green turtle, the greate&s;t delicacy that antient or modern luxury can boa&s;t of: be|&s;ides the variety of eating in it, it is at once &s;o light and nutritive, that no bad con&s;equences are known to attend it from indige&s;tion or &s;urfeit, be the quan|tity devoured ever &s;o great.</P>
<P>This i&s;land has two &s;treams that are called rivers on each &s;ide, with wells of good water all over it; and large ponds or re&s;ervoirs for rain|water: and in its center it is &s;aid to have a bitu|minous &s;pring, which &s;ends forth a liquor like tar; and &s;erves for the &s;ame u&s;es as pitch or lamp-oil.</P>
<P>It has been computed, that between twenty and thirty thou&s;and hog&s;heads of &s;ugar are exported from hence, one year with another.</P>
<P>With regard to indigo, great quantities of which were formerly exported from hence, now little or none is made; but of &s;craped and &s;calded ginger, lignum-vitae, citron water, mela&s;&s;es, rum, lime|juice and fruits, they export va&s;t quantities.</P>
<P>As to imports, they bring lumber, that is tim|ber of all kinds, bread, flour, Indian corn, rice, tobacco, &s;ome &s;alt beef and pork, fi&s;h, pul&s;e, and other provi&s;ions, from the northern colonies; &s;laves from the coa&s;t of Africa; wine from Madeira, Tercera, and Fial, and likewi&s;e &s;ome brandy; beef and pork from Ireland; &s;alt from Cura&s;&s;ao; O&s;naburghs, linen of all &s;orts, broad cloth and
<PB N="479" REF="4800">
ker&s;eys, &s;ilks and &s;tuffs, red caps, &s;tockings and &s;hoes of all &s;orts, gloves and hats, millenary ware and perriwigs, laces, peas, beans, and oats, bi&s;cuit, wine, &s;trong beer, pale ale, pickles, candles, butter, and chee&s;e, iron-ware for their &s;ugar-works, leaden ware, powder and &s;hot, bra&s;s and copper-wares, &amp;c. from Old England.</P>
<P>The inhabitants of Barbadoes are reducible to three cla&s;&s;es, viz. the ma&s;ters, the white &s;ervants, and the black &s;ervants: the former are either Engli&s;h, Scotch, or Iri&s;h, with &s;ome Dutch, French, Portugue&s;e, and Jews. The white &s;ervants, whe|ther by covenant or purcha&s;e, lead more ea&s;y lives than the common day-labourers in England; and when they come to be over&s;eers, their wages, and other allowances, are con&s;iderable. As to the black &s;ervants, it is the intere&s;t of every planter to be more careful of them than even of the white; the former, unle&s;s they &s;hould happen to be made free, with all their po&s;terity, being his perpetual pro|perty. Mo&s;t of the negroes are employed in the field; but &s;ome of them work in the &s;ugar-mills and &s;torehou&s;es; while tho&s;e of both &s;exes, who are mo&s;t likely and handy, are employed as hou&s;e|maids and menial &s;ervants. The original price of a negroe, when he comes from Guinea, is from twenty to forty pounds &s;terling, according to their likelihood; but when they improve in any me|chanic, or other trade, the price ri&s;es greatly: &s;o that four hundred pounds has been refu&s;ed for a good &s;ugar-boiler. The men are indulged in a plurality of wives. But it is ridiculous to imagine that their being converted to Chri&s;tianity intro|duces any alteration in their &s;tate of &s;ervitude. All the difference is, that a planter of any huma|nity may &s;hew &s;ome indulgence to a negroe, who di&s;covers &s;entiment or reflexion enough, to de&s;ire to be baptized. But the truth is, the negroes, in
<PB N="480" REF="4810">
general, are of &s;uch di&s;po&s;itions, as call for the ut|mo&s;t vigilance, and the mo&s;t &s;evere di&s;cipline. They are ob&s;tinate, &s;ullen, treacherous, and vin|dictive; and many of them &s;hew but few faculties that entitle them to be con&s;idered as rational crea|tures. Plantains are the chief &s;upport of the negroes, who have various ways of dre&s;&s;ing them; but they have every week, at &s;tated times, an allowance of Indian corn, bread, &s;alt-fi&s;h, or &s;alt-pork. Every negroe family has a cabin; and adjoining to it, a &s;mall piece of ground, by way of garden, in which the more indu&s;trious &s;ort plant potatoes, yams, and other roots, and rear live &s;tock, which they are at liberty to eat or convert into money for their own u&s;e: and it is incredible what &s;avings of this kind &s;ome of them make. They are fond of rum and tobacco; and they generally lay out their earnings in fine cloaths, and ornaments for them|&s;elves and their wives. The negroes, mulattos, and me&s;tize &s;laves upon the i&s;land are computed at one hundred thou&s;and.</P>
<P>The governor of Barbadoes has a &s;alary of two thou&s;and pound &s;terling, payable out of the four and half per cent. be&s;ides a third of all &s;eizures. The council con&s;i&s;ts of twelve members, and the a&s;&s;embly of twenty-two, cho&s;en yearly, out of the &s;everal pari&s;hes, viz. two for each, by a majority of votes. Mo&s;t of the civil officers are appointed by the governor, who al&s;o collates rectors to the pari&s;hes of the i&s;land. The perqui&s;ites of them are very con|&s;iderable; and their &s;tated &s;alary about one hundred and fifty, or two hundred pounds a year; but the rectory of St. Michael's in Bridgetown is &s;uppo&s;ed to be worth &s;even or eight hundred pounds a year. The church affairs of Barbadoes are governed by a &s;urrogate of the bi&s;hop's appointment. There are upon the i&s;land &s;ome Jews and Quakers, but very

<P>As to the military e&s;tabli&s;hment, here are &s;everal forts, with a good train of artillery, and a militia con&s;i&s;ting of &s;ix regiments of foot, two of hor&s;e, and a troop, called the troop of hor&s;e guard.</P>
<P>The i&s;land is divided into &s;everal precincts, and the&s;e again into pari&s;hes, in which the only place of any note is Bridgetown, &s;ituate on Carli&s;le bay, in the &s;outh we&s;t part of the i&s;land, and having the be&s;t, or rather the only harbour therein. It is rec|koned the fine&s;t and large&s;t town in all the Caribbee-I&s;lands, if not in all the Engli&s;h We&s;t-India colonies, taking its name from a bridge in the ea&s;t part of it, erected over the waters that come from the neighbouring mar&s;hes, after rains; but a dreadful fire lately de&s;troyed a great part of it. It is the &s;eat of the governor, council, and a&s;&s;embly; and al&s;o of the court of chancery. The governor's hou&s;e is about a mile out of the town, which is not reckoned very healthy, on account of the neigh|bouring mar&s;hes. There are &s;everal forts and bat|teries about the town and bay, the latter of which is large enough to contain five hundred &s;ail, and has twenty fathom anchorage, in water &s;o clear, that one &s;ees the bottom, but &s;o rocky, that ca|bles are always buoyed up with ca&s;ks.</P>
<P>Here is a college, with a revenue for profe&s;&s;ors in the &s;everal &s;ciences, to which colonel Codrington was the principal benefactor.</P>
<P>This i&s;land was fir&s;t re&s;orted to by the Engli&s;h in the reign of king James I. but James earl of Carli&s;le obtained the fir&s;t grant of it in 1625, the fir&s;t year of king Charles I. who parcelled it out to &s;everal adventurers, that tran&s;ported them|&s;elves hither. They found no inhabitants, but a good breed of hogs, &s;uppo&s;ed to have been left here by the Spaniards and Portugue&s;e, in their
<PB N="482" REF="4830">
voyages to the continent of America. The ad|venturers applied them&s;elves at fir&s;t to the planting of tobacco, which not thriving as expected, they planted cotton and indigo, which yielded a con|&s;iderable profit; but they made little &s;ugar till 1647, when the colonels Modiford, Drax, and Walrond, with other cavaliers, living unea&s;y under the u&s;urpation, converted their e&s;tates into money, and tran&s;ported them&s;elves to Barbadoes, where they erected &s;ugar works, and acquired very great e&s;tates; and, in the year 1650, the white inhabi|tants of the i&s;land were increa&s;ed to upwards of 30,000, with twice that number of negroes, who exerci&s;ed their ma&s;ters with con&s;tant con&s;piracies, in hopes of recovering their liberty; but not &s;uc|ceeding, were &s;everely puni&s;hed. King Charles II. purcha&s;ed the property of the i&s;land, in 1661, ever &s;ince which time Barbadoes has been a royal government, and the colony granted a duty of four and a half per cent on their &s;ugars, for main|taining the forces and fortifications of the i&s;land, which amounts to ten thou&s;and pounds per annum; but is not always applied to the purpo&s;es it was de&s;igned for, and proves an in&s;upportable burthen on the planters, no other i&s;land having &s;o high a duty laid on their &s;ugars. De Ruyter, the Dutch admiral, treacherou&s;ly attempted to &s;urprize this i&s;land in 1669, in a time of peace, but was bravely repul&s;ed.</P>

<HEAD>St. CHRISTOPHER'S.</HEAD>
<P>The I&s;land of St. Chri&s;topher's, called by our &s;eamen St. Kitts, lies between 17&deg;. 10&prime;. and 17&deg;. 46&prime;. north latitude, about 62&deg;. 30&prime;. we&s;t of Lon|don, four miles north of Nevis, and about &s;ixty from Antigua. Its length, from ea&s;t to we&s;t, is twenty-five miles and a half; its greate&s;t breadth,
<PB N="483" REF="4840">
from north to &s;outh, &s;even; and its circumference about &s;eventy-five.</P>
<P>It was di&s;covered by Chri&s;topher Columbus in his fir&s;t voyage to America, who is &s;aid to have called it St. Chri&s;topher, not from his own name, but from the figure of a very high mountain in the upper part of it, which bearing a le&s;&s;er on its &s;ummit, put him in mind of the picture of St. Chri&s;topher, who is repre&s;ented as a giant, with our infant Saviour on his back.</P>
<P>The air is &s;ultry, but plea&s;ant and healthful. Some repre&s;ent it as one of the mo&s;t delightful i&s;lands in the world. A ridge of mountains runs through the i&s;land, the tops of which are over|grown with palmettoes, cotton trees, lignum-vitae, but the &s;ides and the &s;kirts of them are very fertile. This i&s;land produces not only &s;ugar, but to|bacco, indigo, ginger, pine-apples, papaus, tama|rinds, prickle-pears, two different kinds of pep|per, with cotton, maize, gourds, water-melons, lettuce, par&s;ley, peas, pur&s;lane, and many other vegetables. The produce of &s;ugar is &s;aid to be fourteen thou&s;and hog&s;heads per annum, at a me|dium, the quality of which is reckoned &s;uperior to that of Barbadoes. The i&s;land, in general, is well &s;upplied with &s;prings and hot baths, the mountains being of a &s;ulphureous compo&s;ition. In a mountain about three miles north of Fort Charles, there is &s;aid to be a &s;ilver mine: but it is not worked. The whole land on the i&s;land, fit for &s;ugar planta|tion, does not exceed, it is thought, 24000 acres, and tho&s;e of light &s;andy &s;oil. At the &s;outh-ea&s;t end are &s;alt ponds, which yield a &s;alt more &s;trong and pungent than the French. They are &s;aid to make three hog&s;heads of &s;ugar here to one of rum.</P>
<P>There are &s;everal forts in the i&s;land, well provi|ded with arms, artillery, and military &s;tores. The
<PB N="484" REF="4850">
inhabitants are computed at about eight thou&s;and whites, and above eighteen thou&s;and negroes.</P>
<P>Ba&s;&s;eterre, the capital, is &s;aid to be a very hand|&s;ome town. It is &s;ituated on a cape, that has a bay on each &s;ide, fit for &s;hipping, and is &s;ecured by Londonderry fort towards the ea&s;t, and by &s;ix batteries, rai&s;ed at different landing places, and mounting forty-three cannon.</P>
<P>This i&s;land was di&s;covered, as we have already ob&s;erved, by Columbus in his fir&s;t voyage to Ame|rica. The Spaniards having de&s;erted it, the Engli&s;h and French took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it in 1625, and di|vided it between them. They lived in great amity together, till a war broke out between the two na|tions, when the Engli&s;h drove the French entirely out of the i&s;land; and the country having been yielded to the crown of Great-Britain, by the treaty of Utrecht, all the French territory was &s;old for the benefit of the public.

<P>It is more noted for good harbours, than all the Engli&s;h i&s;lands in the&s;e &s;eas; yet &s;o encompa&s;&s;ed with rocks, that it is of dangerous acce&s;s in many parts of it, e&s;pecially to tho&s;e that are not well acquainted with the coa&s;t. Of the&s;e har|bours, the chief are, None&s;uch, St. John's, En|gli&s;h, and Falmouth harbours, Willoughby and Carli&s;ie bays.</P>
<P>The climate is hotter than Barbadoes, and very &s;ubject to hurricanes. The &s;oil is &s;andy, and much of it overgrown with wood; but what is wor&s;e, there are but few &s;prings, and not &s;o much as a

Its product is much the &s;ame with that of the other Caribbee-I&s;lands. As good Mu&s;covado &s;u|gar is now made here as in any of the &s;ugar i&s;lands, and they al&s;o have learned the art of claying it.</P>
<P>This i&s;land contains about &s;eventy thou&s;and acres, and produces, one year with another, about &s;even|teen or eighteen thou&s;ond hog&s;heads of &s;ugar, with ginger, cotton, pine-apples, plantanes, wild cinna|mon, and other tropical fruits, and &s;ome tobacco. There is more veni&s;on here than in any other of our Caribbee i&s;lands, with great plenty of fowl and black cattle.</P>

<HEAD>NEVIS.</HEAD>
<P>Nevis is about &s;ix leagues in circumference, and lies only three or four miles &s;outh of St. Chri&s;to|pher's. The &s;oil is fruitful, and the &s;taple com|modity &s;ugar, which &s;erves all the purpo&s;es of mo|ney. Here are &s;ometimes violent rains and tor|nadoes, as in the other i&s;lands, and the air is even hotter than that of Barbadoes. There are many remarkable in&s;ects and reptiles, as the flying tyger, the horn-fly, and fly-catcher, and a kind of &s;nail called the &s;oldier; and &s;ome of the lizards are of a mon&s;trous &s;ize. The &s;ea abounds with a variety of excellent fi&s;h, as groopers, rock-fi&s;h, old-wives, cavallies, wel&s;hmen, mudfi&s;h, wilks, cockles, lob|&s;ters, &amp;c. Land crabs are very common on this i&s;le: they are &s;maller than &s;ea crabs, and make little burrows, like rabbits, in the woods, towards the tops of the mountains. The only venomous creatures are &s;corpions and centipedes.</P>

They have plenty of a&s;paragus here, and there is a tree called diddle-doo, which bears a lovely blo&s;&s;om of the fine&s;t yellow and &s;carlet colours, and is e&s;teemed a &s;overeign remedy again&s;t the green &s;ickne&s;s. The liquorice-bu&s;h runs wild along the &s;tone walls of common fields, like the vine; but there is no lignum vitae, or iron wood, here. The butter of this i&s;land is not good, and new chee&s;e far wor&s;e. The &s;heep have no horns nor wool, but are hairy and &s;mooth &s;kinned, and generally full of &s;mall red or black &s;pots, re&s;em|bling tho&s;e of a fine &s;paniel. They breed twice a year, if not oftener, and generally bring two, three, or four lambs at a time; and what is more ex|traordinary, &s;uckle them all. The rams are of a red pale colour, with a thick row of long &s;trait red hair hanging down from the lower jaw to their brea&s;t, as far as the fore legs. The hogs, being fed with Indian corn, Spani&s;h potatoes, and &s;ugar-cane juice, are exceeding &s;weet food, white, and fat; and &s;o are the fowls and turkies, which are fed with the &s;ame diet. The ground doves here are about the &s;ize of a lark, of a chocolate colour, &s;potted with a dark blue, their heads like that of a robin-red-brea&s;t, and their eyes and legs of a mo&s;t pure red.</P>

<P>Mon&s;errat was di&s;covered by Columbus in 1493. It lies twenty-five miles almo&s;t &s;outh &s;outh-ea&s;t from Nevis; twenty we&s;t &s;outh-we&s;t from An|tigua; forty north-we&s;t from Guadaloupe; and two hundred and forty from Barbadoes. It is of an oval figure; about three leagues in length; the &s;ame in breadth; and eighteen in compa&s;s. The Spaniards gave it the name of Mon&s;errat from a fancied re&s;emblance that it bore to a mountain of that name near Barcelona, in Old Spain; where is a famous chapel dedicated to the Ble&s;&s;ed Virgin.</P>
<P>The climate, &s;oil, and produce of Mont&s;errat are much the &s;ame as tho&s;e of the other Engli&s;h Carib|bee I&s;lands. The mountains yield cedars, the Cy|pre&s;s-tree, the iron-tree, with other woods, and &s;ome odoriferous &s;hrubs. It is well watered and fruitful; and the planters formerly rai&s;ed a great deal of indigo. The &s;urrounding &s;eas produce &s;ome hide|ous mon&s;ters, particularly two, which from their re|markable ugline&s;s, as well as the poi&s;onous quality of their fle&s;h, are called &s;ea devils. The lamanture, by &s;ome called the &s;ea-cow, is found in this i&s;land, and generally at the entrance of fre&s;h water rivers. According to the accounts we have of it, it is an amphibious animal; and lives mo&s;tly on herbage. Its fle&s;h is reckoned very whole&s;ome food, when &s;alted; and they are &s;o large, that two or three of them load a canoe.</P>
<P>The re&s;idence of the governor of the Leeward I&s;lands is either upon Nevis, Antigua, Mont|&s;errat, or St. Chri&s;topher's; but each of the three i&s;lands, where he does not re&s;ide, has a deputy|governor of its own, who is appointed by the crown likewi&s;e, and who pre&s;ides both over the a&s;&s;embly and the council; the latter of which, in

Part of the e&s;tate ari&s;ing from it, amounting, as it is &s;aid, to two thou&s;and pounds a year, with two plantations in Barbadoes, was bequeathed, in 1710, by Chri&s;topher Codring|ton, <ABBR>e&s;q</ABBR> governor and captain-general of Bar|badoes, to the &s;ociety for propagating the go&s;pel, towards the in&s;truction of the negroes, in the Ca|ribbee I&s;lands, in the Chri&s;tian religion, and the erection of a college at Barbadoes, for teaching the liberal arts.</P>
<P>The land of this i&s;land lies low, but is fertile: the inhabitants apply them&s;elves chiefly to the breeding of cattle, and rai&s;ing provi&s;ions, with which they &s;upply the neighbouring i&s;lands. Many of the commodities, however, which are rai&s;ed in the other We&s;t India i&s;lands, may be al&s;o rai&s;ed here, &s;uch as citrons, pomegranates, oranges, rai&s;ins, Indian figs, maiz, cocoa-nuts, cinnamon, pine-apples, and the &s;en&s;itive plant, with various kinds of woods and drugs, &s;uch as Bra&s;il, ebony, pepper, indigo, and the like.

<P>Dominica lies between Martinico and Guade|loupe, about eight leagues from each, being near twenty-eight miles long, and thirteen broad. Be|fore the late peace, by which this and the two fol|lowing were ceded to Great-Britain, it was a neu|tral i&s;land, and &s;erved occa&s;ionally to wood and water in. Next to Canada and Loui&s;iana, it may be con&s;idered as one of the mo&s;t valuable acqui&s;i|tions we obtained by that peace. When it was reduced by lord Rollo towards the clo&s;e of the late war, he found almo&s;t the whole windward coa&s;t &s;ettled by the French, notwith&s;tanding it had been formally declared to be neutral by the treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle, in 1648. There is no commo|dity or vegetable produced by the riche&s;t of our other i&s;lands, that may not be rai&s;ed here in great abundance. The declivities of the hills may be cultivated to the very tops, &s;o gentle is their ri&s;e;

and they often terminate in beautiful, well wa|tered, fruitful vallies. The &s;oil is of a black mould, and remarkably rich. It contains about thirty rivers, one of them navigable up the country for &s;ome miles. Here, as in &s;ome others of the Carib|bees, is a &s;ulphur mountain, and hot &s;pring, equal in &s;alubrity to tho&s;e of Bath in England; and the fine fruits, particularly the pine-apples, are &s;uperior to any that grow on the French i&s;lands; and no better timber of every kind is to be found, than what grows in Dominica. At the north-we&s;t end of the i&s;land, is a deep &s;pacious &s;andy bay, called Prince Rupert's; and well &s;ecured from the winds by mountains on all &s;ides. There are &s;till about three or four hundred natives upon the i&s;land. By the late&s;t advices, it appears, that the &s;ale and &s;ettlement of the lands in this and the other neutral i&s;lands advance very fa&s;t.&mdash;Young, <ABBR>e&s;q</ABBR> is lieutenant governor.</P>

<P>Tobago lies forty leagues &s;outh by we&s;t from Barbadoes; about thirty-five &s;outh-ea&s;t from St. Vincent; forty ea&s;t from Granada; and between thirty and forty from the Spani&s;h Main. It is thirty-two miles in length, about nine in breadth, and &s;eventy in circumference; &s;o that it is ra|ther larger than Barbadoes, or indeed any of our Leeward I&s;lands: and, near the north-ea&s;t extremi|ty, lies a &s;mall i&s;land, called Little Tobago, which is two miles in length, and one in breadth.</P>
<P>The climate of Tobago is far more temperate than could be expected in an i&s;land that is but 11&deg;. 10&prime;. north from the equator; for the force of the &s;un is dimini&s;hed by the &s;ea breezes. The &s;pice and gum-trees, with which it abounds, contribute to its &s;alubrity. Tobago has another favourable circum&s;tance to recommend it; namely, its lying out of the tract of tho&s;e hurricanes that often prove &s;o fatal to the other We&s;t-India i&s;lands. The north-we&s;t extremity is mountainous; but the re&s;t of the i&s;land agreeably diver&s;ified with ri&s;ings and fallings. The &s;oil, in general, is a rich black mould proper for producing, in the greate&s;t plenty, whatever is rai&s;ed in other parts of the We&s;t-Indies. There are many &s;prings, together with commodious bays and creeks. But the valuable trees which grow here are, perhaps, its greate&s;t riches; for be|&s;ides the different kinds of wood that are found in the other We&s;t-Indian I&s;lands, it is &s;aid, that the true nutmeg-tree, and the cinnamon-tree, with that which produces the real gum-copal, are found on this i&s;land. The fig-trees on Tobago are reck|oned equal to tho&s;e in Spain and Portugal. India and Guinea-corn, French-beans, various kinds of peas, the cu&s;hou-apple, that is both meat and

<P>As for animals, here are wild hogs, pickerees, which re&s;emble a hog, armadilloes, guanoes, which are of the alligator kind, Indian conies; and badgers, hor&s;es, cows, a&s;&s;es, &s;heep, deer, goats, and rabbits. No i&s;land in the world, we are told, can boa&s;t &s;uch a variety of fi&s;hes, both &s;hell and others, particularly turtle and mullets, of a mo&s;t delicious ta&s;te.

The&s;e i&s;lands produce very fine timber, &s;ugar, indigo, tobacco, pea&s;e, and millet; but the cocoa-tree does not thrive &s;o well in them as in the other i&s;lands. There is a lake in a mountain about the middle of the i&s;land, that &s;upplies it with fre&s;h-water &s;treams, and &s;everal bays and harbours lie round it, that might be fortified to great advantage; &s;o that it is very convenient for &s;hipping, not being &s;ubject to hurricanes.</P>

leagues to the north of Jamaica, one hundred miles to the ea&s;t of Jucatan, as many to the &s;outh of Cape Florida, and commands the entrance of both the gulphs of Mexico and Florida, and the Windward Pa&s;&s;age; &s;o that the Spaniards, who are the only po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of it, may, with a tolerable fleet, not only &s;ecure their own trade, but annoy their neighbours.</P>
<P>There are no winters in this i&s;land; but in July and Augu&s;t, when the &s;un is vertical, the rains and &s;torms are great, otherwi&s;e the country would be in|tolerably hot. The faire&s;t &s;ea&s;on is when the &s;un is furthe&s;t off, and then it is hotte&s;t in the morning; for towards noon a &s;ea-breeze &s;prings up, which blows pretty bri&s;k till the evening. The trade|winds in the&s;e &s;eas blow from the north-ea&s;t. At the full and change of the moon, from October to April, there are bri&s;k winds at north and north-we&s;t, which in December and January often turn to &s;torms, though this is called the fair &s;ea&s;on. It is finely watered, and agreeably diver&s;ified with woods, lawns, and valleys. The &s;oil is capable of producing, in the greate&s;t plenty, every thing that we have mentioned to grow in other American i&s;lands; but the Cuba (commonly called the Ha|vannah) tobacco is thought to excel that of all the world. The pine apples here are excellent, and their &s;ugars would equal their tobacco in goodne&s;s, had they hands to cultivate their canes. The other products are, ginger, long pepper, and other &s;pices; ca&s;&s;ia, ma&s;tic, aloes, large cedars, and other oderi|ferous trees; oaks, pines, palm-trees, plenty of large vines, fine cotton-trees, plantains, bananas, ananas, guavas, lemons, cocoas, and two &s;orts of fruit, called camilor and guanavana; the fir&s;t like a china-orange, and the other in the &s;hape of a heart, with a juice between &s;weet and acid. The copper mines here furni&s;h the Spani&s;h plantations with a

&s;ufficiency of that metal for all their bra&s;s guns. Gold du&s;t is &s;ound in the &s;ands of the rivers; but it is uncertain whether there are any gold or &s;ilver mines, the hopes of which occa&s;ioned the butchery of all the antient inhabitants, who were either un|able or unwilling to di&s;cover them: if there are any, they are not worked. A chain of hills runs through the middle of the i&s;land; but the land near the coa&s;t is generally a level, champaign country. The interior parts lie quite uncultivated and unin|habited; and it hath been ob&s;erved, that the i&s;land contains more churches than farms more prie&s;ts than planters, and more lazy bigots than u&s;eful la|bourers.</P>
<P>Cuba has many good ports and harbours, which are of great advantage to &s;hips for pa&s;&s;ing the gulph in &s;afety; but there are &s;carce any naviga|ble rivers. Both the coa&s;ts and rivers abound with fi&s;h, and al&s;o with alligators. There are great conveniences for making &s;alt; but the inhabitants avail them&s;elves very little of them. The cattle brought hither by the Spaniards have multiplied ex|ceedingly, va&s;t numbers now running wild in the woods, of which many are killed chiefly for their hides and tallow, that are &s;ent to Spain. Their fle&s;h al&s;o, being cut into pieces and dried in the &s;un, &s;erves to victual &s;hips. The&s;e cattle are often &s;o fat, that they die through the burthen of their grea&s;e. Cuba has likewi&s;e abundance of mules, hor&s;es, &s;heep, wild boars, and hogs, together with wild and tame fowl, parrots, partridges, blue heads, large tortoi&s;es, quarries of flint, and &s;everal fountains of bitumen, which is u&s;ed in&s;tead of pitch, as well as for medicinal purpo&s;es. Upon the whole, the i&s;land is plea&s;ant, and its pre&s;ent &s;tate flouri&s;h|ing, the Spaniards having every year for a con&s;i|derable time pa&s;t, particularly &s;ince the taking of the Havannah, added &s;omething to its improve|ment.

Formerly its exportations never equalled tho&s;e of the &s;mall Briti&s;h i&s;land of Antigua. The rea&s;on of this, next to the indolence of the Spa|niards, was the great facility with which the inha|bitants make their money, by means of the galleons and the flota, and the very great contraband trade that is carried on here, in defiance of their laws and regulations, and even with the connivance of the government of the i&s;land.</P>
<P>It is divided into &s;even provinces, the civil government of which is dependent on that of St. Domingo, or Hi&s;paniola; and as to &s;piritu|als, its bi&s;hop, who&s;e &s;ee is at St. Jago, though he commonly re&s;ides at the Havannah, is &s;uffragan to the archbi&s;hop of St. Domingo. The ea&s;t part of the i&s;land is &s;aid to be under the governor of St. Jago, and the we&s;t of the governor of the Ha|vannah. There are many con&s;iderable towns in the i&s;land, but the two ju&s;t mentioned are the chief.</P>
<P>St. Jago, which &s;till retains the name of the ca|pital, though now much inferior to the Havannah, &s;tands at the bottom of a large bay, about two leagues from the &s;ea, on the &s;outh-ea&s;t &s;ide of the i&s;land. It is di&s;tingui&s;hed from St. Jago in Chili by the addition of di Cuba, as the other is by that of di Chili. Since the un&s;ucce&s;sful attempt made by the Engli&s;h under admiral Vernon and general Wentworth, the fortifications have been repaired, and the town hath recovered &s;ome degree of its former lu&s;tre, carrying on a good trade with Old and New Spain, and above all with the Canaries.</P>
<P>The Havannah &s;tands on the north-we&s;t coa&s;t of the i&s;land, fifty leagues from Cape St. Antonio, its we&s;ternmo&s;t point; four hundred and ninety miles we&s;t from St. Jago; forty one leagues &s;outh of the Cape of Florida, the gulph of which it com|mands, by being &s;ituated at its mouth; and two

days &s;ail from the Straits of Bahama. The town it&s;elf, di&s;tinct from the fortifications, is about two miles in circuit, and contains about twenty-&s;ix thou&s;and &s;ouls. Though the port is one of the fine&s;t and mo&s;t &s;ecure in the world within; yet the narrowne&s;s of its pa&s;&s;age has rendered it &s;o difficult of acce&s;s, that the galleons have been often in&s;ult|ed and taken within &s;ight of it, without receiving any a&s;&s;i&s;tance from the fortifications. The churches here are inconceivably magnificent, and rich, in plate and ornaments; the &s;treets clean and &s;treight, but narrow; and the hou&s;es are of &s;tone, and make a good appearance, but are ill furni&s;hed. The inhabitants, in general, are &s;aid to be more &s;ociable and conver&s;ible than tho&s;e of the other Spani&s;h dominions in America. The city, which is one of the riche&s;t in America, e&s;pecially when the galleons are here, &s;tands in the mo&s;t fruitful part of the i&s;land on the we&s;t &s;ide, along the &s;hore, which rounds &s;o much that above half of it is wa&s;hed by the &s;ea, and the re&s;t by two branches of the river La|gida. There is a fine &s;quare, with uniform build|ings in the middle of it. This city is of the great|e&s;t importance to the Spaniards of all the cities in America, being the place of rendezvous for all their fleets, in their return from that quarter of the world to Spain, and lying at the mouth of the gulph of Florida, through which they are all obliged to pa&s;s. The Spaniards, therefore, not without rea&s;on, call it the Key of all the We&s;t-Indies, to lock or open the door or entrance thereto; and indeed no &s;hips can pa&s;s that way without leave from this port. Here is always a &s;quadron of Spani&s;h men of war; and here, in Septem|ber, meet the galleons, flota, and other &s;hips, from &s;everal ports, both of the continent and i&s;lands, to the number of perhaps fifty or &s;ixty &s;ail, to take
<PB N="499" REF="5000">
in provi&s;ions and water, with great part of their lading, and for the convenience of returning to Spain in a body. A continual fair is kept till their departure, which is generally before the end of the month; when a proclamation is made, forbidding any that belong to the fleet to &s;tay in the town, on pain of death, and, upon firing a warning gun, they all go on board. The value of the cargo is &s;eldom le&s;s than &s;even millions &s;terling; &s;o that it may well be imagined, a place of &s;uch import|ance is in a condition both to defend it&s;elf, and to protect the &s;hips that frequent it. Towards the clo&s;e of the late war, this city, after a long and ob&s;tinate defence, was &s;urrendered, with all its forts and dependencies, to his Britannic maje&s;ty's arms, by capitulation, on the 12th of Augu&s;t 1762; but was re&s;tored by the peace. The Spaniards have been bu&s;y, &s;ince that time, in repairing the da|mages which the fortifications received during the &s;iege, and adding new ones, be&s;ides taking every other precaution to &s;ecure it, for the future, from all attempts of an enemy.</P>
<P>Two leagues from the Havannah by land, but little more than a league by &s;ea, lies the town of Guan Abacoa.</P>

<P>Though the climate is hot, yet it is not reckon|ed unwhole&s;ome, being refre&s;hed by breezes and rains. It is allowed to be both the mo&s;t fruitful and plea&s;ante&s;t i&s;land in the We&s;t Indies, being di|ver&s;ified with hills and vallies, woods and rivers, producing ananas, bananas, grapes, oranges, le|mons, citrons, toronias, limes, dates, and apri|cots, fairer and better ta&s;ted than tho&s;e of the other i&s;lands, together with whole fore&s;ts of cab|bage trees, elms, oaks, pines, acajou, and other trees, large and lofty. The other commodities are &s;ugar, hides, indigo, cotton, cocoa, coffee, ginger, tobacco, &s;alt, wax, honey, amber-grea&s;e, and va|rious kinds of drugs and dying woods. Croco|diles and alligators infe&s;t its coa&s;ts and rivers; but they abound at the &s;ame time with tortoi&s;es. The hor&s;es and herds of cattle here are &s;aid to be innumerable, and &s;ufficient to &s;upply mo&s;t of the neighbouring colonies.</P>
<P>The i&s;land is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed partly by the French, and partly by the Spaniards, the former being &s;et|tled in the north-we&s;t part, and the latter in the &s;outh: but the French have improved their &s;et|tlements to &s;uch a degree, and are grown &s;o pow|erful, that they may make them&s;elves ma&s;ters of the whole i&s;land, whenever they plea&s;e. Upon the whole, however, the population of this i&s;land bears no proportion to the extent of it. The profits the French make from its products are
<PB N="501" REF="5020">
immen&s;e; and, according to &s;ome authors, in &s;ugar, indigo, tobacco, and coffee, thirty years ago, their exports amounted to about one million two hundred thou&s;and pounds &s;terling annually. During the la&s;t war, their exports, as appeared from the prodigious value of the &s;hips that were taken, mu&s;t have con&s;iderably exceeded that &s;um; and &s;ince the peace of 1763, nothing has been wanting on the part of the French, to render their &s;ettlement on St. Domingo a counterbalance for all the ce&s;|&s;ions which they were obliged to make to the Engli&s;h by that treaty. In this they are greatly a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the Spaniards them&s;elves, who, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of great trea&s;ures, but without indu&s;try, lavi&s;h the former to purcha&s;e from their French neigh|bours the returns of the latter.</P>
<P>This i&s;land was the fir&s;t of the Spaniards di&s;co|veries, and for &s;ome time the center of their commerce in America. After their conque&s;ts in Peru they &s;lighted it, the gold found here being nothing in compari&s;on to what they met with in that kingdom. The Buccaneers and other adven|turers came hither afterwards, to hunt the cattle the Spaniards had imported, which were grown wild, and killed incredible numbers of them for their hides and tallow; and here they al&s;o u&s;ed to victual their &s;hips. The French, finding the i&s;land almo&s;t de&s;erted, took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the north-we&s;t part of it, which they &s;till po&s;&s;e&s;s; whereupon the Spaniards returned and &s;ettled, in the &s;outh part of the i&s;land again, to prevent other nations &s;eizing that, and interrupting their navigation to the continent.</P>
<P>It is &s;aid, the con&s;ideration that chiefly induced the court of England to re&s;tore the i&s;lands of Guadaloupe and Martinico to the French by the late definitive treaty, was, that mo&s;t of the inhabitants of tho&s;e i&s;lands, would in that ca&s;e

have removed to Hi&s;paniola, and there, in a &s;hort time, rai&s;ed more &s;ugar than both of them pro|duced. The French in this i&s;land were lately in arms again&s;t their governors; but as to the cau&s;e, we have no information that can be depended on.</P>
<P>The principal places belonging to the Spaniards in the i&s;land are St. Domingo, Conception de la Vega, St. Jago de los Cavalieros, Monte Chri&s;|to, and Porto de la Plata.</P>
<P>St. Domingo, the capital, is a large well built city, &s;ituate on a &s;pacious harbour on the &s;outh &s;ide of the i&s;land, containing about thirty thou&s;and in|habitants, and defended by a ca&s;tle and other works.

St. Domin|go is al&s;o the re&s;idence of the governor-general of the Spani&s;h Indies, and of an archbi&s;hop, and court of royal audience. The archbi&s;hop's &s;uf|fragans are the bi&s;hops of Conception in this i&s;land, St. John's in Porto Rico, St. Jago in Cuba, Ven|zuela in New Ca&s;tile, and of the city of Hon|duras. The juri&s;diction of the court of Royal Audience extends to all the Spani&s;h We&s;t-Indian i&s;lands. In &s;hort, this city owes its pre&s;ent &s;upport to the lawyers and clergymen, who&s;e profe&s;&s;ions oblige them to re&s;ide in it. A fine navigable river falls into the &s;ea a little to the we&s;t of it.</P>
<P>Conception is a con&s;iderable town, and the &s;ee of a bi&s;hop, twenty leagues north of St. Domingo. St. Jago de los Cavalieros lies ten leagues north-we&s;t of Conception, and enjoys a fine air. Porto la Plata, or the Haven of Silver, &s;tands on an arm of the &s;ea, thirty five leagues north of St. Domingo, and Monto Chri&s;to, at the mouth of the river Ya|guey, ten miles we&s;t of Porta de la Plata, and forty north-we&s;t from St. Domingo.</P>

<P>Cape St. Fran&ccedil;ois, &s;ituate on the north &s;ide of the i&s;land, is in a flouri&s;hing opulent condition, having a fine harbour, a bri&s;k trade, and about eight thou&s;and inhabitants.</P>
<P>St. Lewis, or Port Lewis, &s;tands on a &s;mall i&s;land on the &s;outh-we&s;t coa&s;t of the i&s;land, and has a good harbour with a fort, but labours un|der a &s;carcity of fre&s;h water.</P>
<P>Port Paix is a place of con&s;iderable &s;trength, ly|ing oppo&s;ite the i&s;land of Tortuga, on the north-we&s;t coa&s;t of the i&s;land.</P>
<P>Petit Guaves, and Leogane, &s;tand on Donna Maria Bay near Cape St. Nicholas, at the we&s;t end of the i&s;land. The former is the olde&s;t French &s;ettlement in the i&s;land, and a place of con&s;iderable trade; and the latter is the re&s;idence of the French governor-general, and of the royal judicature, with that of the &s;upreme council, who&s;e juri&s;diction ex|tends from Cape Mougon to the river Artibonite.</P>
<P>There are two other &s;mall places belonging to the French called La Petite Riviere, and L'E&s;terre, the latter of which &s;tands a little within land.</P>
<P>The i&s;land of Tortuga, mentioned above, had its name from the turtles with which it formerly abound|ed. It is about &s;ix leagues long from ea&s;t to we&s;t, and three where broade&s;t. The French have a popu|lous flouri&s;hing &s;ettlement, called Cayona, with a har|bour in the &s;outh part of the i&s;land. It yields all the commodities found in the other We&s;t-Indian i&s;lands, together with wild boars; but has little or no fre&s;h water. Of the other i&s;lands on this coa&s;t, the chief are Savona, and Mona, belong|ing to the Spaniards. Hi&s;paniola is &s;eparated from Cuba and Jamaica by what is called the Wind|ward-pa&s;&s;age.</P>

<HEAD>PORTO-RICO.</HEAD>
<P>Porto-Rico is parted from Hi&s;paniola by a narrow channel, being about a hundred and twenty miles long, and &s;ixty broad. The air here is ex|ce&s;&s;ive hot and unwhole&s;ome, e&s;pecially during the rainy &s;ea&s;on. The i&s;land is al&s;o &s;aid to be &s;ubject to great droughts and hurricanes, and much ex|po&s;ed to the de&s;cents of privateers. The princi|pal commodities in which the inhabitants deal are &s;ugar, ginger, hides, cotton thread, and raw cot|ton, ca&s;&s;ia, ma&s;tic, &amp;c. Their pork is excellent, and &s;o is the fle&s;h of their kids, but their mutton is poor dry food. They have good &s;hip-timber, and fruit-trees, with rice and Indian corn. A num|ber of brooks and rivers de&s;cend from the moun|tains, which run from ea&s;t to we&s;t, and are planted with woods.</P>
<P>The north part of the i&s;land, which is the mo&s;t barren, is &s;aid to contain various mines, &s;ome of them of &s;ilver and gold; but it does not appear that any of them are worked, though it is con|fidently affirmed, that gold-du&s;t is often found in the &s;ands of the rivers. The woods are &s;tored with parrots, wild pidgeons, and other fowl. Eu|ropean poultry is found here in plenty, and their coa&s;ts abound with fi&s;h. A breed of dogs, that the Spaniards brought over to hunt and tear in pieces the defencele&s;s natives, are &s;aid to run wild in the woods near the &s;ea-&s;hore, and &s;ub&s;i&s;t upon land-crabs, that burrow in the ground.</P>
<P>This i&s;land was conquered by the earl of Cum|berland, at his own expence, in the reign of queen Elizabeth; but he was obliged to abandon it again, having lo&s;t mo&s;t of his men by &s;ickne&s;s in the lat|ter end of the &s;ummer, when this and all other places in the&s;e latitudes are very unhealthy.</P>
<P>Infinite pains have been taken by the Spani&s;h government to prevent an illicit trade at this place;
<PB N="505" REF="5060">
but &s;uch is the convenience of its &s;ituation for that traffic, that all the &s;evere edicts i&s;&s;ued again&s;t it have been ineffectual.</P>
<P>The capital of the i&s;land is St. John's, &s;ituated on a &s;mall i&s;land on the north coa&s;t, within the harbour, which the Spaniards called Porto-Rico, from the trea&s;ures they found there. It is well built and populous, and the &s;eat of a governor, as well as a bi&s;hop's &s;ee. Both the town and the entrance of the harbour are &s;trongly fortified. The former is al&s;o joined to the Main I&s;land by a cau&s;e|way.</P>
<P>The other places in Porto Rico worth mention|ing, are Port del Agnada, where the flota provide them&s;elves with water, and other nece&s;&s;aries, in their voyage to Spain; and Boraba d'Inferno, famous for an excellent turtle fi&s;hery.

This i&s;land is the large&s;t on the coa&s;t, being about twenty-five leagues in length, and twenty in breadth. The air is &s;aid to be un|whole&s;ome, but the &s;oil fruitful, producing &s;ugar, tobacco, indigo, cotton, ginger, and Indian corn.

<P>Margarita, &s;ituate two hundred miles we&s;t of Trinidad, is about thirty five miles in compa&s;s. It abounds with verdant groves and pa&s;tures, fruits, and Indian corn, and was formerly highly prized
<PB N="506" REF="5070">
for its pearl fi&s;hery; but the rapaciou&s;ne&s;s of the Spaniards hath &s;ince de&s;troyed that fi&s;hery; nor do pearls bear the &s;ame price now as when America was fir&s;t di&s;covered. The greate&s;t inconveniency of the i&s;land is the want of fre&s;h water. Since the year 1620, when the Dutch invaded the i&s;land and demoli&s;hed the ca&s;tle, it hath been abandoned by the natives.</P>
<P>There are many more &s;mall i&s;lands in the&s;e &s;eas belonging to the Spaniards, &s;uch as the Gol|den I&s;land, I&s;le of Pines, the Samballas I&s;lands, the Ba&s;timentos, and Sotoventos, on the coa&s;t of Terra Firma, be&s;ides tho&s;e in the South Sea.</P>

<HEAD>MARTINICO.</HEAD>
<P>MARTINICO, the mo&s;t con&s;iderable of the French We&s;t-Indian i&s;lands, is &s;ituated a hundred and twenty miles north-we&s;t of Barba|does, between the fourteenth and fifteenth degree of north latitude, being about &s;ixty miles long, but &s;carce twenty broad in any place.</P>
<P>The inland part is mountainous, and many ri|vulets fall from thence into the &s;urrounding &s;ea; and there are &s;everal &s;afe and commodious har|bours, all well fortified, with good roads for &s;hip|ping. The produce of the i&s;land con&s;i&s;ts of &s;ugar, tobacco, cotton, ginger, indigo, cacao, aloes, pimento, cocoes, plantains, and other tropical fruits. The coa&s;ts abound with turtles; but the French are not &s;o expert in fi&s;hing for them as the Engli&s;h.</P>
<P><PB N="507" REF="5080">
Though Martinico is generally &s;aid to be health|ful for tho&s;e that are &s;ettled upon it, yet it is certain that the va&s;t quantity of water, which runs through it, creates a humidity which is very nox|ious to the con&s;titution of the inhabitants.</P>
<P>In the year 1700, the French &s;ettled upon the i&s;land of Martinico were computed to be fifteen hundred, be&s;ides the negroes whom they em|ployed, and great numbers of Caribbeans, who were readmitted into the i&s;land, but were obliged to work as &s;laves, and to live among the French, that they might have no opportunity to form con|&s;piracies and plots with their countrymen, or to a&s;&s;ociate together. Before it was &s;ubdued by the Engli&s;h in the la&s;t war, it could rai&s;e ten thou&s;and white inhabitants, fit to carry arms, and above forty thou&s;and negroes or &s;laves. Be&s;ides this force, &s;ome companies of regulars were always quartered in the i&s;land; &s;o that nothing but the mo&s;t notorious mi&s;conduct could have rendered the Briti&s;h troops ma&s;ters of it with &s;o little lo&s;s as they &s;uffered on that occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>Martinico is not only the re&s;idence of the go|vernor-general and intendant, but likewi&s;e of a &s;overeign council, which &s;uperintends all their other i&s;lands, and even the &s;ettlements on St. Do|mingo and Tortuga. The governor-general is commonly a man of quality; and both he and the intendant, and the lieutenant-governor, are paid out of the finances of Old France. The governor of Martinico as well as Guadaloupe is paid in &s;ugar, as, indeed, are all the other officers of the i&s;land, excepting &s;ome incon&s;iderable &s;ums, that i&s;&s;ue from the trea&s;ury of Old France. The hundred weight of &s;ugar is rated at four livres ten &s;ols. The go|vernors are allowed &s;ixty thou&s;and pounds weight, with a pen&s;ion of one thou&s;and crowns paid in Old France. The lieutenant-governors have twenty
<PB N="508" REF="5090">
thou&s;and pounds weight, and five thou&s;and livres &s;alary. The king's judges, attornies, and other officers, have each an allowance of &s;ix thou&s;and weight; but the coun&s;ellors of the &s;overeign's council have no more than twelve hundred weight, or twelve of their negroes exempted from the ca|pitation tax. This is a tax paid by the white men and the free negroes, who are hired &s;ervants, and con&s;i&s;ts of a hundred weight of coar&s;e &s;ugar a year, for each dome&s;tic or negroe, who is em|ployed in manufacturing it; and of &s;ix livres for every other. All provi&s;ions imported into the i&s;land are &s;ubject to a duty of one per cent. in &s;pecie; and the third of all forfeitures and fines goes to the crown. Martinico owes its flouri&s;hing &s;tate to the French government having tran&s;ported thither, by way of puni&s;hment, great numbers of its prote&s;tant &s;ubjects, &s;ome of whom voluntarily &s;ettled there.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t con&s;iderable places in the i&s;land are St. Pierre, or St. Peter's, Fort Royal, and Trinity-town.</P>
<P>St. Pierre was built in 1665, and is a hand&s;ome town, extending along the &s;hore, and wa&s;hed by a river on each &s;ide. There is a &s;trong fort, be&s;ides &s;everal batteries, and other works, that command both the town and road, the former of which is al&s;o walled.</P>
<P>Fort Royal lies at the di&s;tance of &s;even leagues by land, and nine by water from St. Pierre. It is al&s;o well fortified; but is otherwi&s;e far inferior to St. Pierre.</P>
<P>Trinity-Town is a flouri&s;hing &s;ettlement at the bottom of Trinity-Bay.</P>
<P>The harbour or bay called Cul de Sac Robert, is a very fine and &s;afe one, being two leagues deep, and having water enough for the large&s;t &s;hip, with two i&s;lands at its entrance to break the force of the waves.</P>

<HEAD>GUADALUPE.</HEAD>
<P>Guadalupe, &s;o named by Columbus from its re&s;embling tho&s;e of that name in Spain, is &s;ituate in 16&deg;. north latutude, thirty leagues north-we&s;t from Martinico. It is &s;aid to be near an hundred leagues in compa&s;s, but is cut in two by a deep gulph, or bay, on each &s;ide, and a channel called the Salt River.</P>
<P>The air of Guadalupe is preferable to that of Martinico, being more &s;alubrious, and le&s;s &s;ultry. Its products are &s;ugar, coffee, cotton, ba&s;tard cin|namon, indigo, ginger, and many other vegetables, particularly the copau-tree, from which is extracted a mo&s;t excellent bal&s;am; the milk &s;hrub, &s;o called from its yielding a &s;ub&s;tance like milk, when pre&s;&s;ed, which falls little &s;hort of the capau bal|&s;am; the moubane-tree, which bears a yellow plum, with which the natives fatten their hogs; and the corbary-tree, the gum of which, when hardened in the &s;un, becomes &s;o tran&s;lucent, that the Caribbeans wear it formed into beads and bracelets. Many of the mountains with which Gua|dalupe abounds, are covered with wood; and no|thing can be more verdant, or more beautifully variegated than the large fruitful plains, which lie at the bottom.</P>
<P>One of the mountains is &s;aid to emit a continual &s;moke, and to communicate a &s;ulphureous ta&s;te to the neighbouring &s;treams.</P>
<P>Such is the fertility of Guadalupe, that it hath been a&s;&s;erted, that if it was as well peopled, and cul|tivated as Barbadoes, it would yield &s;ugar enough for all Europe. One hundered thou&s;and hog&s;|heads, we are told, were exported yearly from it before the la&s;t war, when it was reduced by the Engli&s;h. The mo&s;t remarkable bird upon the i&s;land
<PB N="510" REF="5110">
is that called the Devil, which is peculiar to this i&s;land and Dominica: it is a bird of pa&s;&s;age, of the &s;ize of a pullet, and all its plumage coal black: it lives on fi&s;h, which it catches in the &s;ea at night, being unable to bear the light in the day|time, when flying; &s;o that they often run again&s;t interpo&s;ing objects, and fall down. After their fi&s;h-hunting in the night, they repair to a moun|tain, called the Devil's Mountain, where they lodge by pairs in holes, like rabbits. Their fle&s;h is good nouri&s;hing food, though of a fi&s;hy ta&s;te.</P>
<P>The i&s;land is pe&s;tered with an in&s;ect called a ravet, &s;haped like a cock-chafer, of a &s;tinking &s;mell, and preying upon books and furniture; and whatever they do not gnaw, is di&s;coloured by their ordure: but great numbers of them are de&s;troyed by a kind of &s;piders, &s;ome of which are as big as a man's fi&s;t. The bees of Guadaloupe are very different from tho&s;e of Europe, being black, &s;maller, and without &s;tings. The&s;e bees, in&s;tead of making combs, lay their honey in bladders of wax, about the form and &s;ize of a pidgeon's egg. The only u&s;e that is made of their wax, which is of a dark purple colour, is to &s;ecure the corks of bottles: the honey is never of a thicker con&s;i&s;t|ence than that of olive oil.</P>
<P>The Cul de Sacs, as the French call them, or gulphs about this i&s;land, abound with turtle, &s;harks, land crabs, and various other fi&s;hes.</P>
<P>One of the two divi&s;ions of the i&s;land is called Grande-Terre; and the other is divided into Capes Terre, or Cabes Terre, and Ba&s;&s;e-Terre, which la&s;t is al&s;o the name of the capital, a con&s;iderable town, &s;ituated on both &s;ides of Bailiff River, and well fortified.</P>
<P>This i&s;land, as well as Martinico, was reduced by the Briti&s;h arms in the late war; but re&s;tored by the definitive treaty of peace. The French fir&s;t began to &s;end colonies to it about the year 1632.</P>
<P><PB N="511" REF="5120">

It was di&s;covered by Columbus in his &s;econd voyage to America, anno 1493; and named by him Marigalante, or the Gallant Mary, after the name of his &s;hip. This i&s;land abounds with tobacco, cinnamon-trees, and other products of the Caribbee I&s;lands; and contains a great many grottos, where large crabs are found; as al&s;o &s;everal rivers, and ponds of fre&s;h water. Along the ea&s;tern &s;hore run high perpendicular rocks, which give &s;helter to va&s;t numbers of tro|pical birds, they being as full of holes as a pidgeon|hou&s;e.</P>
<P>Before the la&s;t reduction of it by the Briti&s;h arms, it manufactured about one thou&s;and hog&s;heads of &s;ugar yearly. The French began to &s;end colonies about the year 1647.</P>

<HEAD>ST. LUCIA.</HEAD>
<P>St. Lucia, one of the i&s;lands formerly call|ed Neutral, but by the la&s;t definitive treaty of peace, ceded in full right to France, lies two miles &s;outh of Martinico, and is about twenty-two miles in length; and eleven in breadth. It is &s;aid to be much the fine&s;t and mo&s;t convenient of any of the Caribbee I&s;lands, being diver&s;ified with hills and vallies, well watered, and furni&s;hed with excel|lent harbours. The land is rich; but a great part of it is covered with woods, which abound in wild fowl, and yield great quantities of excellent tim|ber. The neighbouring &s;ea is well &s;tored with fi&s;h.</P>
<P>There are three other &s;mall i&s;lands belonging to the French in the&s;e &s;eas, viz. St. Martin, St. Bartho|lomew
<PB N="512" REF="5130">
and De&s;eada, or De&s;iderada, i. e. the De|&s;irable I&s;land. St. Martin lies a little to the north-we&s;t of St. Bartholomew, which is ten leagues north of St. Chri&s;topher's. De&s;eada, &s;ituate about twenty miles from Guadaloupe, is &s;aid to produce the be&s;t cotton of any of the French I&s;lands. It had its name from Columbus, being the fir&s;t land he di&s;covered in his &s;econd voyage to America, anno 1493. St. Martin is of no con&s;equence; but St. Bartholomew's, tho' encompa&s;&s;ed with for|midable rocks, yet produces tobacco and ca&s;&s;ava, with &s;ome excellent woods, and lime-&s;tone.</P>

<P>THE Dutch We&s;t-India I&s;lands are St. Eu|&s;tatia, Saba, Cura&s;&s;ao, Bonaire, and Aruba. The two fir&s;t are Caribbee I&s;lands; but the three la&s;t lie off the coa&s;t of Terra-Firma. St. Eu&s;ta|tia, &s;ituate three leagues north-we&s;t of St. Chri&s;to|pher's, is a very well cultivated i&s;land, about three leagues in compa&s;s. Be&s;ides tobacco, the inhabi|tants have of late years rai&s;ed and exported great quantities of &s;ugar. They al&s;o breed hogs, rabbits, goats, and all &s;orts of poultry. The air is whole|&s;ome, but it is &s;ubject to terrible thunder-claps, earthquakes, and hurricanes; and there is a &s;car|city of fre&s;h-water. Before a hurricane, it is &s;aid, the birds lay them&s;elves flat on the ground: the rain that precedes it, is always &s;alt and bitter.</P>
<P>This i&s;land is reckoned the &s;tronge&s;t of all the Caribbee I&s;lands, there being but one landing place, which is commanded by a fort, and may be ea&s;ily defended by a few men. The Dutch fir&s;t took

po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it in 1635; and &s;ince the treaty of Ry&s;wick, have remained in quiet po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it.</P>
<P>Saba is a &s;mall plea&s;ant i&s;land, thirteen miles north-we&s;t of Eu&s;tatia. The &s;ea is &s;o &s;hallow a|bout it, that none but but &s;loops can come near it; nor even they, but at a &s;mall creek on the &s;outh &s;ide of the i&s;land. Mo&s;t of the inhabitants are &s;aid to be &s;hoe-makers, or dealers in &s;hoes. There is a de|lightful valley in the i&s;land, which produces nece&s;|&s;aries for the inhabitants, with &s;ome indigo and cotton.</P>
<P>Cura&s;&s;ao, or Curacoa, is about nine or ten leagues in length, and five in breadth; lying in 12&deg;. 14&prime;. north latitude; nine or ten leagues from the coa&s;t of Terra-Firma.</P>
<P>The climate is neither whole&s;ome, nor agreea|ble, nor the &s;oil fruitful; yet the i&s;land is popu|lous, and the indu&s;try of the inhabitants &s;uch, that it produces a great deal of &s;ugar and tobacco. It is well &s;upplied with provi&s;ions, and all other commodities from Europe, and the other Dutch &s;ettlements, in which it carries on a very lucrative and exten&s;ive contraband trade with the Spaniards in Terra-Firma. Let the Spani&s;h governors pro|hibit this trade never &s;o &s;everely, the Spaniards &s;tand &s;o much in need of European commodities, that they will run all hazards to obtain them. The chief town and harbour is about three leagues from the &s;outh-ea&s;t end of the i&s;land. The town, for its &s;ize, is one of the faire&s;t and fine&s;t in America, and contains every thing nece&s;&s;ary to render it commodious and agreeable, as far as the climate and &s;oil will permit. The other Dutch i&s;lands of Bonacre and Aruba are con&s;iderable, chiefly (which is al&s;o the ca&s;e of Cura&s;&s;ao) for their &s;itua|tion near the coa&s;t of Terra-Firma, which gives the inhabitants an opportunity of carrying on a

<P>The i&s;land al&s;o naturally produces mo&s;t of the We&s;t Indian commodities; but is much infe&s;ted with mu&s;kettoes. St. Croix, or Santa Cruz, a &s;mall i&s;land, about twenty leagues we&s;t of St. Chri&s;topher's, is under the protection of the king of Denmark; but mo&s;tly the property of &s;ome Iri&s;h gentlemen. The &s;oil is &s;aid to be rich, producing many excel|lent dying and other woods, proper for hou&s;e and &s;hip-building, together with oranges, citrons, granates, lemons, the mandioca root, and the papau|tree, the fruit of which makes a mo&s;t excellent &s;weet-meat.</P>

It has feathers of all the colours in the rain|bow, but the ends are of a golden colour, as is al&s;o the belly; its &s;ides are of an emerald green; the neck has a circle as red as a carbuncle; the bill and legs are black as jet; its eyes like diamonds; and there is a green tuft of feathers on its crown. They live on the juice of flowers, e&s;pecially tho&s;e of the cotton tree, &s;mell like amber, and build their ne&s;ts, which are curiou&s;ly lined with cotton down and &s;ilk, among the thick leaves of the boughs.</P>
<P>There are al&s;o painted crabs here, which are &s;aid to be very good meat. Some of them have vio|let-coloured &s;hells; others yellow, full of purple &s;pecks; and others tawny, with red &s;treaks. They creep down the hills in May, con&s;uming all the herb|age in their way, and after going four times to the water to wa&s;h them&s;elves, retire to the woods; but at a certain &s;ea&s;on, the females take to the &s;ea, and there lay their eggs, which being afterwards ca&s;t a&s;hore, and warmed by the &s;un, produce young ones, that creep to the woods, and as they grow bigger climb up the rocks, where the old ones keep together in va&s;t multitudes, and &s;o &s;top up the holes that they cannot be found out. They creep out of their &s;hells through an opening at the tail, which is &s;carce di&s;cernible, and thus lie bare and &s;tripped of their &s;hells, being only covered with a thin &s;kin, which at la&s;t grows as firm as that they left.</P>
<P>Salt Tortuga is a barren, rugged, uninhabited i&s;land, &s;ituated north-we&s;t from Margarita, in the latitude of 10&deg;. 35&prime;. north, and &s;o named to di&s;tin|gui&s;h it from the other turtle i&s;lands on the coa&s;t of America, on account of a large &s;alt pond at the ea&s;t end of it, within two hundred paces of the &s;ea,

<HEAD>The BAHAMA ISLANDS.</HEAD>
<P>THE Bahama I&s;lands, belonging to Great-Britain, are &s;ituated in the Atlantic Ocean, to the north of the i&s;land of Cuba, and not far from the coa&s;t of Florida, &s;tretching from the north-we&s;t to the &s;outh-ea&s;t, between 21 and 27&deg;. of north latitude. They are very numerous, and twelve of them pretty large.</P>
<P>Bahama, which is the large&s;t, being about fifty miles in length, though very narrow, and gives name to the re&s;t, lies twenty-five leagues from the continent of Florida. It enjoys a &s;erene temperate air, with a fruitful &s;oil, well watered every where with &s;prings and rivulets.</P>
<P>Though the&s;e were the fir&s;t lands di&s;covered in America by Columbus the Spaniards never thought of &s;ettling in them. The Engli&s;h knew nothing of them till 16$7, when Capt. William Sayle, being bound to Carolina, was forced among them by a &s;torm, which gave him an opportunity of ex|amining them carefully, particularly that which at pre&s;ent is known by the name of Providence. At
<PB N="517" REF="5180">
his return, he reported the benefit they might be of to the &s;tate; upon which, grants of them were made out to proprietors; but the government was re&s;erved in the hands of the crown. None of them, however, are yet &s;ettled, except Providence, Lucays, and Harbour I&s;land; which &s;eems &s;ur|prizing, as they would certainly prove of the great|e&s;t advantage to Great-Britain, if properly culti|vated.</P>
<P>The Straits of Bahama, which the Briti&s;h fleet &s;o happily cleared in the la&s;t expedition again&s;t the Havannah, are well known to navigators, for the dangers and difficulties that attend the pa&s;&s;ing them.</P>
<P>The&s;e i&s;lands lying near to Hi&s;paniola, and to the noted port of the Havannah, in the i&s;land of Cuba, where the Spani&s;h galleons and flota always rendezvous before they return to Europe, having the Gulph of Florida to the we&s;t, and the Wind|ward Pa&s;&s;age to the ea&s;t of them, in time of peace they are capable of great improvement in point of trade, and have always been a good retreat for di&s;|abled &s;hips, blown from different parts of the con|tinent of America. In time of war, the Briti&s;h cruizers and privateers &s;tationed at the Bahama I&s;lands, are more capable to ob&s;truct and annoy the Spani&s;h trade, homeward-bound, than any that are &s;tationed at the re&s;t of the Briti&s;h colonies in Ame|rica. Accordingly, New-Providence, which is a very thriving colony, was of great benefit to the Briti&s;h trade in the late war. The chief town of the i&s;land is called Na&s;&s;au.</P>
<P>Many of the&s;e i&s;lands, through the dangers at|tending the navigation to them, are &s;o little known, that it is uncertain whether they are inhabited or not. They are &s;uppo&s;ed to amount altogether to near five hundred; but many of them are only barren rocks.</P>

<HEAD>The BERMUDAS, or SUMMER ISLANDS.</HEAD>
<P>The Bermudas, or Summer I&s;lands, are a clu&s;ter of i&s;lands lying in the Atlantic Ocean, in 32&deg;. 20&prime;. north latitude, about &s;even or eight hundred miles ea&s;t from Cape Hatoras, in South-Carolina, which is the neare&s;t land to them. They are &s;aid to be about four hundred in number, but mo&s;t of them &s;o &s;mall and barren as not to be habitable. How they got the name of Bermudas is uncertain; but the other is a corruption of Sommers, from Sir George Sommers, who was &s;hipwrecked on them in 1609. No part of the world enjoys a clearer air or a more temperate climate, or is better furni&s;hed with plenty of fle&s;h, fi&s;h, poultry, fruits, herbs, and roots. However, we are told by &s;ome late vovage-writers, that both the air and &s;oil of the&s;e i&s;lands have undergone a mo&s;t &s;urprizing al|teration for the wor&s;e, &s;ince they were fir&s;t di&s;co|vered.</P>
<P>Formerly the Bermudas abounded with fine ce|dars, of which there are &s;till con&s;iderable remains, that &s;erve for building of &s;loops, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the New England white pine. Ambergrea&s;e is often found, and whales caught on this coa&s;t; and the turtle-fi&s;hing trade is of great &s;ervice for the &s;ub|&s;i&s;tence of the inhabitants. The governor, it is &s;aid, has ten pounds for every whale that is caught. There is a breed of black hogs here, that are thought to have been left by the Spaniards; and a white chalk &s;tone, which is ea&s;ily chi&s;&s;elled, and exported for building gentlemen's hou&s;es in the We&s;t-Indies. Some tobacco is rai&s;ed in the&s;e
<PB N="519" REF="5200">
i&s;lands, and they abound in excellent oranges and palmetto trees; but the water, except what falls from the clouds, and is pre&s;erved in ci&s;terns, is bracki&s;h.</P>
<P>The chief i&s;land is St. George, which is not a|bove &s;ixteen miles in length, and three, at mo&s;t, in breadth. There are three clergymen in the i&s;land, who have a hand&s;ome provi&s;ion: and Dr. Bark|ley, late bi&s;hop of Cloyne, propo&s;ed the erecting a college here, for the education of the Indians; but the de&s;ign mi&s;carried. The i&s;land takes its name from the chief town.</P>

<HEAD>NEWFOUNDLAND.</HEAD>
<P>Newfoundland is of a triangular form, and a|bout as big as Ireland, being two hundred and eighty miles in length from north to &s;outh, and nine hundred and thirty in circumference. There is no coa&s;t in the world better accommodated with harbours all round. Tho&s;e on the ea&s;t and &s;outh coa&s;ts are be&s;t known, namely Bonavi&s;ta, Trinity, Capelin, and Conception bays, Torbay, St. John's, Harbour, the Bay of Bulls, Fre&s;h Water Bay, tho&s;e of Bilcay, St. Mary, Placentia, Bay of Fortune, or St. Peter's, and the Bay of De&s;pair; but the mo&s;t famous and con&s;iderable is the Bay of Placentia. On the north the i&s;land is &s;eparated from Terra de Labrador, or New Britain, by the Strait of Bellei&s;le, which runs N. E. and is about twenty-eight miles over in its narrowe&s;t part; on the we&s;t it has the Gulph of St. Lawrence, and on the &s;outh and ea&s;t the Atlantic Ocean. The mo&s;t we&s;tern point is called Cape Rye, and the mo&s;t &s;outherly Cape Race, or Raz.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the climate of Newfoundland, it is inten&s;ely hot in &s;ummer, and in&s;upportably cold in winter, from the very &s;ituation, and a variety of
<PB N="520" REF="5210">
natural cau&s;es. For four or five months in the winter the ground is covered with &s;now, frozen as hard as cry&s;tal. The &s;outhern and ea&s;tern coa&s;ts &s;eldom enjoy a very &s;erene &s;ky, from their neigh|bourhood to the Great Bank, which is almo&s;t con|&s;tantly covered with a thick fog; but in the north|ern and we&s;tern parts the &s;ky is very clear, both in &s;ummer and winter.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the &s;oil, it is in general a very barren country, full of bleak mountains and naked rocks. Mo&s;t of the meadows and vales produce nothing but a kind of mo&s;s. Many &s;pecies of timber, however, grow here in the utmo&s;t perfec|tion, and the firs are as fit for ma&s;ts as tho&s;e of Nor|way. There are &s;aid al&s;o to be &s;ome fruitful &s;pots in it, and a kind of rye which grows naturally with out culture, and is very nouri&s;hing, with wild &s;trawberries, and ra&s;pberr&s;es. The i&s;land abounds with wild fowl, and with deer, hares, rabbits, foxes, &s;quirrels, bears, beavers, wolves, otters, and other quadrupeds; and the &s;ea is plentifully &s;tocked with different kinds of delicious fi&s;h, be|&s;ides cod, the &s;taple commodity. It is certain, however, that the inhabitants would be in the ut|mo&s;t di&s;tre&s;s for broad, and many other nece&s;&s;aries, but for the exports thither from the mother-coun|try, or the continent of America, from which they have almo&s;t every thing, except fi&s;h, veni&s;on, and wild fowl.</P>
<P>The chief and almo&s;t only trade here is in fi&s;h; of which there is &s;uch plenty on the coa&s;ts of the i&s;land, that the wh$$e would almo&s;t might be &s;up|plied from it: all &s;orts being taken here in im|men&s;e quantities; but the principal fi&s;hery is of cod, wherewith at lea&s;t five hundred &s;ail of &s;hips are laden every year, for France, Spain, Portugal, Italy, England, and other parts. The main fi&s;hery is on the great bank, and the other banks about
<PB N="521" REF="5220">
this i&s;land, as al&s;o along the coa&s;t. The great bank is a va&s;t mountain under water, extending in length according to the mo&s;t accurate &s;ea-charts, from the forty-fir&s;t degree of north latitude to 49&deg;. 25&prime;. and in breadth from 42&deg;. 30&prime;. to 51&deg;. 30&prime;. of longitude we&s;t from London.</P>
<P>The depth of water on it is from five to &s;ixty fathom. But whatever be the figure or dimen|&s;ion of this bank, it is covered with a va&s;t quan|tity of &s;hells, and &s;everal kinds of fi&s;h of all &s;izes, mo&s;t of which &s;erve for food to the cod-fi&s;h, who&s;e number here &s;eems to equal the grains of &s;and on the bank it&s;elf. Between two and three hundred ve&s;&s;els have loaded here annually, for two centuries, yet this va&s;t con&s;umption has produced no apparent diminution of their numbers.</P>
<P>The next Bank, is called the Green-Bank. The charts make it about a hundred and twenty miles long, and about fifty over where broade&s;t: it lies off the &s;outh coa&s;t of Newfoundland. There are &s;everal other banks, but they are not con&s;iderable enough to de&s;erve particular notice.</P>
<P>The Great Strand, or drying place for fi&s;h, which is about a league in extent, lies between two &s;teep hills, one of which is &s;eparated from the Strand by a &s;mall rivulet, which forms a kind of lake cal|led the little bay, abounding with &s;almon. The Great Strand may contain at once wherewithal to load three&s;core &s;hips. There is another le&s;&s;er Strand for the u&s;e of the inhabitants, who fi&s;h all along the coa&s;t. The fi&s;hing &s;ea&s;on is from &s;pring to September. All the train oil, that comes from Newfoundland, is drawn chiefly from the livers of the cod. The principal towns are Placentia, Bonavi&s;ta, and St. John.</P>
<P>The Indians of this i&s;land are &s;aid to be a gentle, mild, tractable people, ea&s;ily gained by civility and good u&s;age. They paint their bodies, and in winter
<PB N="454" REF="5230">
are covered with &s;kins and furs, e&s;pecially round the wai&s;t. Their &s;tature is &s;mall, but mu&s;cular and robu&s;t, their che&s;ts full, and their faces broad, to a degree of deformity. None of the &s;avages of this i&s;land are ever found with a beard, which is generally a&s;cribed to a prevailing cu&s;tom among them of plucking the hairs up by the roots, the moment they begin to appear; an operation in which they are very dextrous. Pilfering, cunning, and duplicity are &s;aid al&s;o to be ingredients in the character of tho&s;e people; nor are they a&s;hamed, when detected; or provoked, when obliged to make re&s;titution. They are reported to be more rational in their religious opinions than the Indians on the continent; to have carried &s;ome arts, particularly pottery, to great perfection; and to di&s;cover &s;ome &s;eeds of genius capable of great improvement by cultivation.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t &s;ettlements were made by the Engli&s;h, in the year 1010, and the French were permitted to &s;ettle here in the reign of King Charles II. but were obliged to quit the i&s;land by the peace of Utrecht in 1713, only they were left at liberty to dry their nets on the northern &s;hores. Towards the end of the late war, the French &s;urprized the i&s;land, and took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, by capitulation, of St. John's, on the 27th of June 1762; but in September following were compelled to leave it. By the fifth article of the definitive treaty of peace, the &s;ubjects of France have a liberty of fi&s;hing and drying on a part of the coa&s;t of the i&s;land of Newfoundland, &s;uch as is &s;pe|cified in the fifteenth article of the treaty of U|trecht; al&s;o the liberty of fi&s;hing in the gulph of St. Laurence, at the di&s;tance of three leagues from all the coa&s;ts belonging to Great-Britain, and at the di&s;tance of fifteen leagues from the coa&s;ts
<PB N="523" REF="5240">
of the i&s;land of Cape Breton. The i&s;lands of St. Pierre and Miquelon were al&s;o ceded to them by the &s;ixth article, to &s;erve as a &s;helter for their fi&s;her|men; but they are not to forrify the&s;e i&s;lands. By the eighteenth article of the &s;aid peace, his catholic maje&s;ty de&s;i&s;ts from any preten&s;ions, in favour of his &s;ubjects, to the right of fi&s;hing in the neigh|bourhood of the i&s;land of Newfoundland.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>CAPE-BRETON.</HEAD>
<P>This i&s;land, which, from the nature of its &s;ituation, is of the utmo&s;t con&s;equence to the Briti&s;h colonies and fi&s;heries in America, lies be|tween 45 and 57&deg;. of north latitude, and between 61 and 62&deg;. of we&s;t longitude, being about one hundred miles in length, and fifty in breadth. It is &s;eperated from Nova Scotia by the narrow Strait of Can&s;o, or Fron&s;ac; and is about twenty leagues from Newfoundland.</P>
<P>All the northern coa&s;t is very high, and almo&s;t inacce&s;&s;ible; nor is it much ea&s;ier to land any where on the we&s;t coa&s;t, till you come to the Strait of Fron&s;ac; but on the &s;outh-ea&s;t there are &s;everal good harbours, bays, and creeks, e&s;pecially that of Loui&s;bourg, which is one of the fine&s;t in America, being almo&s;t four leagues round, and having every where &s;ix or &s;even fathom water.</P>
<P>The climate here is much the &s;ame with that of Quebec, only more &s;ubject to fogs; the air, howe|ver, &s;eems to be pretty whole&s;ome.</P>
<P>The i&s;land abounds with lakes and rivers, coals, and lime&s;tone; and though there are many barren &s;pots in it, apples, pul&s;e, wheat, and other corn, flax and hemp, are or may be rai&s;ed in it. Of the timber-trees, the mo&s;t common are oaks of a prodigious bigne&s;s, pines fit for ma&s;ts, a&s;h,
<PB N="524" REF="5250">
maple, plane, and a&s;pin trees. There is no oc|ca&s;ion for digging deep, or draining the waters, to come at the coals here, as in other countries.</P>
<P>There are hou&s;es, hogs, oxen, &s;heep, goats, and poultry on the i&s;land, but game is &s;carce. The partridges are almo&s;t as big as phea&s;ants, and not unlike them in the colour of their feathers. The quantities of cod and other fi&s;h on the coa&s;t is almo&s;t incredible; and there is no &s;carcity of whales, &s;ea|wolves, porpoi&s;es, and &s;eals.</P>
<P>This i&s;land was one of our conque&s;ts in the be|ginning of the late war; Loui&s;bourg, its fortre&s;s, with the i&s;land of St. John, and its other appur|tenances, having been &s;urrendered, by capitula|tion, on the 26th of July, 1758. It was before taken from the French, by the Engli&s;h, in 1745; but re&s;tored by the treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle, in 1748. To avoid expence, and prevent the French from &s;ettling on it again, all the fortifications at Loui&s;bourgh have been demoli&s;hed.</P>
<P>There are &s;everal i&s;lands lying round Cape Bre|ton, among which are tho&s;e of St. Peter, and Ma|dame, or Maurepas; but the chief is St. John's, the produce of which is nearly the &s;ame as that of Cape Breton, but the &s;oil is &s;aid to be much better. This la&s;t hath lately been made a &s;eparate govern|ment; and a town, it is &s;aid, hath been laid out in it, to be called Charlotte Town.</P>
