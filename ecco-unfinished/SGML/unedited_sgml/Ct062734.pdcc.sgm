<L>The moral of my Tale is this,</L>
<L>Variety's the &s;oul of bli&s;s.</L>
<L>But &s;uch Variety alone</L>
<L>As makes our home the more our own.</L>
<L>As from the heart's impelling pow'r</L>
<L>The life-blood pours it's genial &s;tore;</L>
<L>Tho', taking each a various way,</L>
<L>The active &s;treams meandring play</L>
<L>Thro' ev'ry artery, ev'ry vein,</L>
<L>All to the heart return again;</L>
<L>From thence re&s;ume their new career,</L>
<L>But &s;till return, and center there:</L>
<L><PB N="24" REF="23">So real Happine&s;s below</L>
<L>Mu&s;t from the Heart &s;incerely flow;</L>
<L>Nor, li&s;t'ning to the Syren's &s;ong,</L>
<L>Mu&s;t &s;tray too far, or re&s;t too long.</L>
<L>All human plea&s;ures thither tend;</L>
<L>Mu&s;t there begin, and there mu&s;t end;</L>
<L>Mu&s;t there recruit their languid force,</L>
<L>And gain fre&s;h vigour from their &s;ource.</L>
