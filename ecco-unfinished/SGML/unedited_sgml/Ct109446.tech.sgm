<HEAD>PREFATORY DEDICATION.
TO
LORD HAWKE,
BARON TOWTON.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My Lord,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN an aera when ambition&mdash;dissipation&mdash;and
hypocritic gentlene&s;s of man|ners
are profe&s;&s;edly the pur&s;uits of the
mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed characters;&mdash;when
the external graces are more coveted,
and more a&s;&s;iduou&s;ly cultivated than the
virtues of the heart:&mdash;In an aera, my
Lord, when many authors, and &s;ome
the mo&s;t eminent, labour to promote
the fir&s;t&mdash;encrea&s;e the &s;econd&mdash;heighten
the poli&s;h of the third&mdash;and pro&s;titute
their pens, as if determined, to extingui&s;h
the la&s;t, by every art of fal&s;e rea&s;oning,
<PB N="vi" REF="4">
by every invention of imagination; it
may appear &s;ingular, that this little vo|lume,
directly militating again&s;t the&s;e
accompli&s;hments of the great world,
and attempting to &s;upply their places
by qualities built on the more &s;olid
ba&s;is of religion and morality, &s;hould
a&s;k for patronage from one whom
fate has ordained to move in that
elevated &s;phere; but, my Lord, even
in courts the mo&s;t notorious for the
profligacy of manners, virtue has ever
found &s;ome votaries.</P>
<P>The corruptions of vice become con|&s;equential
in proportion as they be|come
fa&s;hionable;&mdash;and folly a&s;&s;umes
the air of ornamental grace, and diffu&s;es
it&s;elf almo&s;t univer&s;ally, only when che|ri&s;hed
and &s;upported by tho&s;e whom the
little world look up to in the &s;uperior
walks of life, and con&s;ider as exam|ples
of imitation.</P>
<P><PB N="vii" REF="5">
From hence we find the advocates
for error perpetually multiplying, and
the clear fountain of true happine&s;s ex|changed
for the turbid &s;tream of unpro|fitable
plea&s;ure.&mdash;For it is certain, real
felicity cannot be obtained but by a
firm adherence to virtue, and a deter|mined
conformity to its dictates.&mdash;The
glare of vice may, for a while, dazzle
the &s;ight; but it cheers not the &s;oul, or
makes glad the heart from the purity of
its lu&s;tre: like an <HI>ignis fatuus</HI> it leads
us into perplexities&mdash;doubts&mdash;and mi&s;|fortune,
and there leaves us to &s;truggle
with the calamities it has enticed us to pur&s;ue.</P>
<P>The intent, therefore, of the follow|ing
&s;heets, is to give a reli&s;h for the religi|ous
and moral duties; that the veil un|der
which vice approaches the young
and inexperienced may be thrown a&s;ide;
and its allurements, too often fatally &s;uc|ce&s;sful,
be expo&s;ed and evidently di&s;|covered
<PB N="viii" REF="6">
as the harpies of mi&s;chief, and
the harbingers of de&s;truction.</P>
<P>The intent is by gentle means to lead
the negligent and incautious into the
path of rectitude,&mdash;implant in their bo|&s;oms
a love of truth,&mdash;and from the
richne&s;s of the manure and fertility of
the &s;oil make the young plant &s;hoot up
with vigour, and bring forth the plea|&s;ant
fruit of goodne&s;s in abundance and
perfection.</P>
<P>The intent is, I will not &s;ay to make
every man the builder of his own for|tune,
but I will &s;ay more, the e&s;tabli&s;her
of his own peace;&mdash;a ble&s;&s;ing infinitely
more valuable than fame&mdash;riches&mdash;or
power.&mdash;For if he inculcates the maxims
herein contained, he will pa&s;s through
the bu&s;tle of the bu&s;y world, though
&s;urrounded with the &s;nares of villainy,
and machinations of treachery, in &s;afety
and without reproach:&mdash;and when he
<PB N="ix" REF="7">
retires into the &s;eque&s;tered and &s;olitary
&s;cene, he will provide for him&s;elf a rich
repa&s;t, where reflection will feed on the
con&s;olitary comfort of &s;elf-approbation,
and his hours pa&s;s away in the &s;weetne&s;s
of content.&mdash;He will view the misfor|tunes
of mankind with an eye of pity,
and afford them relief:&mdash;He will behold
the plea&s;ures of his neighbours with a
&s;mile of &s;ympathy, and enjoy them as
his own:&mdash;he will pay every tribute
due to his Creator, with gratitude and
joy, and will hold conver&s;e with the God
of his wor&s;hip from the incorruptibility
of his heart, and the purity of his actions.</P>
<P>From your Lord&s;hip's well-known
love of the &s;ocial virtues,&mdash;from that phi|lanthropy
with which your bo&s;om is re|plete,&mdash;from
the ri&s;ing progeny of lit|tle
innocents with which Heaven has
ble&s;&s;ed you, it cannot be doubted but
every effort intended to produce the&s;e
effects will meet with your countenance
<PB N="x" REF="8">
and protection.&mdash;On the&s;e con&s;idera|tions,
therefore, I have ventured to de|dicate
this &s;election to your Lord&s;hip,
flattering my&s;elf the liberty will not be
offen&s;ive, as the motive originated from
an hone&s;t and laudable zeal, and the de|&s;ire
of &s;hewing the gratitude and defe|rence
with which I am,</P>
<CLOSER><SALUTE>My Lord,</SALUTE>
Your Lord&s;hip's mo&s;t devoted,
mo&s;t obedient,
and very humble Servant,

<HEAD>SENTIMENTAL BEAUTIES
AND
MORAL DELINEATIONS.</HEAD>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>ACUTENESS IN REPLICATION.</HEAD>
<P>THIS has ever been allowed a happine&s;s
peculiar to the female &s;ex, particularly on
&s;ubjects wherein they are in &s;ome degree con|versant;
for their imaginations generally keep
pace with the narration, that they anticipate its
end, and are ready to deliver their &s;entiments on
it as &s;oon as it is fini&s;hed, while &s;ome of the
male hearers, who&s;e minds were buried in &s;et|tling
the propriety, comparing the circum&s;tances,
and examining the con&s;i&s;tencies of what was &s;aid,
are obliged to pau&s;e and di&s;criminate before they
think of an&s;wering.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="16">
Indeed a man of reflection, if he does not
keep an intimate commerce with the world, will
be &s;ometimes &s;o entangled in the intricacies of
inten&s;e thought, that he will have the appear|ance
of a confu&s;ed and perplexed expre&s;&s;ion,
while a &s;prightly woman will extricate her&s;elf
with that lively and <HI>rash dexterity</HI> which will al|mo&s;t
always plea&s;e, though it is very far from being always right.</P>
<P>It is ea&s;ier to confound than convince an op|ponent;
the former may be effected by a turn
that has more happine&s;s than truth in it, but a
young lady's vanity &s;hould not be too much ela|ted
with this fal&s;e applau&s;e, which is given, not
to her merit, but her &s;ex: &s;he has not per|haps
gained a victory, though &s;he may be al|lowed
a triumph; and it &s;hould humble her to
reflect, that the tribute is paid, not to her
&s;trength, but her weaken&s;s. It is worth while
to di&s;criminate between the applau&s;e, which is
given from the complai&s;ance of others, and that
which is paid to our own merit.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<PB N="3" REF="17">
<HEAD>AFFABILITY.</HEAD>
<P>IN order to render our&s;elves amiable in &s;o|ciety,
we &s;hould correct every appearance
of har&s;hne&s;s in our behaviour. That courte&s;y
&s;hould di&s;tingui&s;h our demeanour, which &s;prings,
not &s;o much from &s;tudied politene&s;s, as from a
mild and gentle heart. We &s;hould follow the
cu&s;toms of the world in matters indifferent; but
&s;top when they become &s;inful. Our manners
ought to be &s;imple and natural, and of cour&s;e
they will be engaging. Affectation is certain
deformity&mdash;By forming them&s;elves on fanta&s;tic
models, and vying with one another in every
reigning folly, the young begin with being ri|diculous,
and end in being vicious and immo|ral.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>ANXIETY, THE VICE OF AGE.</HEAD>
<P>IGNORANCE of what is good or evil &s;hould cor|rect
Anxiety about worldly &s;ucce&s;s. As ra&s;h|ne&s;s
is the vice of youth, the oppo&s;ite extremes
of immoderate care is the vice of advancing
<PB N="4" REF="18">
years, but &s;ince attention is &s;o often fru&s;trated,
is &s;hould never be allowed to deprive us of tran|quillity;
that degree of uncertainty therefore
ought to render us temperate in pur&s;uit, calm
the perturbation of hope and fear, and cure the
pain of anxiety.</P>
<P>Anxiety is the poi&s;on of human life. It is the
parent of many &s;ins, and of more mi&s;eries. In a
world where every thing is &s;o doubtful;&mdash;where
we may &s;ucceed in our wi&s;h, and be mi&s;erable,
&mdash;where we may be di&s;appointed, and be ble&s;s'd
in the di&s;appointment; what means a re&s;tle&s;s
&s;tir and commotion of the mind? Solicitude
cannot alter the cour&s;e, or unravel the intricacy
of human events:&mdash;Curio&s;ity cannot pierce thro'
the cloud which the Supreme Being hath made
impenetrable to the human eye&mdash;Wi&s;dom com|mands
man to retire after he has done all that
was incumbent on him, and to po&s;&s;e&s;s his mind
in peace. By going beyond this point, by giving
him&s;elf up to immoderate concern about un|known
events, he can do nothing to advance
his &s;ucce&s;s, and does much to ruin his Peace;
&mdash;he plants within his brea&s;t the thorn which is
long to gall him&mdash;To the vanity of life he adds
<PB N="5" REF="19">
vexation of &s;pirit, which is wholly of his own
creation, not of diving appointment.</P>
<P>For the dubious goods of this world were
never de&s;igned by God to rai&s;e &s;uch eager at|tachment.
They were given to man for his oc|ca&s;ional
refre&s;hment, not for his chief felicity:
be &s;etting an exce&s;&s;ive value upon objects which
were intended only for his &s;econdary regard, he
changes their nature. Seeking more &s;atisfaction
from them than they are able to afford, he re|ceives
le&s;s than they might give; from a mi&s;|taken
care to &s;ecure his happine&s;s, he brings
upon him&s;elf certain mi&s;ery.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>INDISCRIMINATE APPLAUSE.</HEAD>
<P>IT is the fault of many that they do not always
carefully di&s;tingui&s;h between running into the
error of detraction, and its oppo&s;ite extreme of
unde&s;erved prai&s;e&mdash;This proceeds from the fal&s;e
idea they entertain, that the direct contrary to
what is wrong, mu&s;t be right. Thus the dread
of only being &s;u&s;pected of one fault, makes them
actually guilty of another.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="20">
The de&s;ire of avoiding the imputation of envy,
impels them to be in&s;incere; and to e&s;tabli&s;h a
reputation for &s;weetne&s;s of temper and genero|&s;ity,
they affect to &s;peak &s;ometimes of very in|different
characters with the mo&s;t extravagant
applau&s;e. But this habit of exaggeration greatly
weakens their credit, and de&s;troys the weight
of their opinion on other occa&s;ions; for people
very &s;oon di&s;cover what degree of faith is to be
given both to their judgment and their veracity.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>METHOD IN THE ARRANGEMENT OF
IDEAS.</HEAD>
<P>IN delivering our &s;entiments on particular &s;ub|jects,
there is nothing which is attended
with better effect, and makes us appear to
more advantage than offering our opinions with
clearne&s;s and preci&s;ion; and this only can be
done by arranging them in proper order, &s;o that
they may appear regularly to ari&s;e one from
the other: this is &s;tiled method, and prevents
confu&s;ion; hinders us from indulging in the
luxuriance of fancy, running into de&s;ultory di|gre&s;&s;ions,
and makes us appear &s;uperior to our
subject.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="21">
Where great &s;prightline&s;s is the natural bent
of the temper, girls &s;hould endeavour to habi|tuate
them&s;elves to a cu&s;tom of ob&s;erving,
thinking, and rea&s;oning. It is not nece&s;&s;ary
that they &s;hould devote them&s;elves to ab&s;tru&s;e
&s;peculation, or the &s;tudy of logic; but &s;he who
is accu&s;tomed to give a due arrangement to her
thoughts, to rea&s;on ju&s;tly and pertinently on
common affairs, and judicious&s;ly to deduce effects
from their cau&s;es, will be a better logician than
&s;ome of tho&s;e who claim the name, becau&s;e
they have &s;tudied the art. That &s;pecies of
knowledge, which appears to be the re&s;ult of
reflection rather than of &s;cience, &s;its peculiarly
well on women.</P>
<P>It is not uncommon to find a lady, who,
though &s;he does not know a rule of &s;yntax,
&s;carcely ever violate one; and who con&s;tructs
every &s;entence &s;he utters with more propriety
than many a learned dunce, who has every rule
of Ari&s;totle by heart, and who can lace his own
thread-bare di&s;cour&s;e with golden &s;hreds of
Cicero and Virgil.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<PB N="8" REF="22">
<HEAD>AVARICE.</HEAD>
<P>ONE of the vices of old age, which appears
the most unaccountable, is that covetous
attachment to worldly intere&s;t with which it is
often charged. But this too can naturally be
deduced from the &s;en&s;e of its feeblene&s;s and
decay.</P>
<P>In proportion as the vigour both of body and
mind declines, timidity may be expected to
encrea&s;e. With anxious and fearful eye, the
aged look forward to the evils which threaten
them, and to the changes which may befal.
Hence, are they apt to overvalue riches, as the
in&s;truments of their defence again&s;t the&s;e dangers,
and as the mo&s;t certain means of &s;ecuring them
again&s;t &s;olitude and di&s;re&s;pect.</P>
<P>But though this cautious frugality may be ju&s;ti|fied;
&s;ordid avarice can by no means be excu&s;ed.
They &s;hould be charitable and do good. They
&s;hould mix beneficence to their friends, with a
cheerful enjoyment of the comforts which befit
<PB N="9" REF="23">
their &s;tate. They will then receive the returns
of real re&s;pect and love. Otherways, by their
riches, they procure no more than pretended
demon&s;trations of regard; while their ill-judged

<P>AWE is the fir&s;t &s;entiment which ari&s;es in the

<HEAD>BEHAVIOUR.</HEAD>
<P>ONE of the chief beauties in a female cha|racter
is that mode&s;t re&s;erve, that re|tiring
delicacy which avoids the public eye, and
is di&s;concerted even at the gaze of admiration.
For when a girl cea&s;es to blu&s;h, &s;he has lo&s;t the
mo&s;t powerful charm of beauty. That extreme
&s;en&s;ibility, which it indicates, is pecularly en|gaging.</P>
<P>Silence in company, particularly a large one,
is never mi&s;taken by the judicious and di&s;cerning

the female &s;ex. Dignity of behaviour is nece&s;|&s;ary
at public places, but care mu&s;t be taken
not to mi&s;take that for that confident ea&s;e, that
unaba&s;hed countenance which &s;eems to &s;et the
company at defiance.</P>
<P>Women &s;hould be cautious even in di&s;playing
their good &s;en&s;e. It is often thought a&s;&s;uming
a &s;uperiority over the re&s;t of the company; but
their learning &s;hould be kept a profound &s;ecret,
<PB N="12" REF="26">
e&s;pecially from men, who generally look with
a jealous and malign eye on a woman of great
parts, and a cultivated under&s;tanding.</P>
<P>The great art of plea&s;ing in conver&s;ation con|&s;i&s;ts
in making the company plea&s;ed with them|&s;elves.
Detraction &s;hould be avoided, e&s;pecially
among&s;t women where their own &s;ex is con|cerned;
it would be more noble for them to
&s;hew a compa&s;&s;ionate &s;ympathy to the unfortu|nate,
e&s;pecially to tho&s;e who are rendered &s;o
by the villainy of men. It is a laudable pride, as
well as &s;ecret plea&s;ure, which ought to be in|dulged
in being the friend and refuge of the un|happy,
but without the vanity of &s;hewing it.</P>
<P>Every &s;pecies of indelicacy in conver&s;ation
&s;hould be con&s;idered as &s;hameful and highly di&s;|gu&s;ting.
A &s;acred regard &s;hould ever be had to
truth, for lying is a mean and de&s;picable vice;
though a lively embelli&s;hment of a humourous
&s;tory, which is only intended to promote inno|cent
mirth, cannot be under&s;tood to fall under
that head.</P>
<P>Gentlene&s;s of &s;prit and manners is extremely

<P>A fine woman, like other fine things in nature,
has her proper point of view, from which &s;he
may be &s;een to mo&s;t advantage. To fix this
point requires great judgment, and an intimate

mode of female manners, the ladies &s;eem to ex|pect
that they &s;hall regain their a&s;cendency over
men, by the fulle&s;t di&s;play of their per&s;onal charms,
by being always in their eyes at public places, by
conver&s;ing with them with the &s;ame unre&s;erved
freedom as they do with one another; in &s;hort, by
re&s;embling men as near as they can. The folly of
this expectation and conduct will &s;oon be &s;hown.
For the power of a fine woman over the hearts
of men, of men of the fine&s;t parts, is even be|yond
what &s;he conceives. They are &s;en&s;ible of
the plea&s;ing illu&s;ion, but they cannot, nor do
they wi&s;h, to de&s;olve it. But if &s;he id determined
to di&s;pel the charm, it certainly is in her power,
&s;he may &s;oon reduce <HI>the angel to a very ordi|nary
girl.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="28">
There is a native dignity in ingenious mo|de&s;ty
to be expected in the gentler &s;ex, which

all innocent freedoms, provided her virtue
is &s;ecure, is both gro&s;ly indelicate and dange|rous,
and has proved fatal to many who have

<P>In fine, to form a complete lady &s;he &s;hould

<P>THE mind of each &s;ex has &s;ome natural kind

<HEAD>COMPASSION.</HEAD>
<P>COMPASSION is an emotion of which we
ought never to be a&s;hamed. Graceful, parti|cularly
in youth, is the fear of &s;ympathy, and the
heart that melts at the tale of woe. We &s;hould
not permit ea&s;e and indulgence to contract our
affections, and wrap us up in &s;elfi&s;h enjoyment.
But we &s;hould accu&s;tom our&s;elves to think of the
di&s;tre&s;&s;es of human life, of the &s;olitary cottage,
the dying parent, and the weeping orphan.
Nor ought we ever to &s;port which pain and di&s;|tre&s;s
in any of our amu&s;ements; nor treat even
the meane&s;t in&s;ect with wanton cruelty.</P>
<P>It has been objected, and it is to be feared
with &s;ome rea&s;on, that female conver&s;ation is
too frequently tinctured with a cen&s;orious &s;pirit,
<PB N="17" REF="31">
and that ladies are &s;eldom apt to di&s;cover much
tenderne&s;s for the errors of a fallen &s;i&s;ter. No
arguments can ju&s;tify, no pleas extenuate it.</P>
<P>To in&s;ult over the mi&s;eries of an unhappy
creature is inhuman, not to compa&s;&s;ionate them is
unchri&s;tian. The worthy part of the &s;ex always
epre&s;s them&s;elves humanely on the failings of
others, in proportion to their own undeviating
goodne&s;s, and by that gentle virtue are prompted
to alleviate the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of the unfortunate and

friend of this &s;ort to pour out their heart to,
they &s;hould be &s;ure of their honour and &s;ecrecy.
She &s;hould not be a married woman, e&s;pecially
if &s;he lives happily with her hu&s;band.</P>
<P>There are certain unguarded moments, in
which &s;uch a woman, though the be&s;t and
<PB N="18" REF="32">
worthie&s;t of her &s;ex, may let hints e&s;cape, which,
at other times, or to any other per&s;on than her
hu&s;band, &s;he would be incapable of; nor will a
hu&s;band in this ca&s;e feel him&s;elf under the &s;ame
obligation of &s;ecrecy and honour, as if confi|dence
had originally been put in him&s;elf, e&s;pe|cially
on &s;ubjects which the world is apt to treat
lightly.</P>
<P>Making confidants of &s;ervants &s;hould be care|fully
avoided. Dignity, not properly under|&s;tood,
very readily degenerates into pride, which
enters into no friend&s;hips, becau&s;e it cannot bear
an equal, and is &s;o fond of flattery as to gra&s;p at
it even from &s;ervants and dependents.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t intimate confidants, therefore, of
proud people, are valets-de-chambres, and wait|ing

<P>Women endeavour to ju&s;tify them&s;elves to

Sometimes they plead ignorance, or at lea&s;t un|certainty
of the gentleman's real &s;entiments.
Sometimes they plead the decorum of their &s;ex,
which enjoins an equal behaviour to all men,
and forbids them to con&s;ider any man as a lover,
till he has directly told them &s;o. But they are
not entitled to plead the obligation of their
virtues in oppo&s;ition to the &s;uperior ones of
gratitude, ju&s;tice, and humanity.</P>
<P>The man is entitled to all the&s;e, who prefers
one woman to the re&s;t of her &s;ex, and perhaps
who&s;e greate&s;t weakne&s;s is this very preference.
The truth of the matter is, vanity and the love
<PB N="29" REF="43">
of admiration is &s;o prevailing a pa&s;&s;ion among&s;t
the &s;ex, that they can be fond of the love, when
they are indifferent to, or, even, when they de&s;|pi&s;e
the lover.</P>
<P>But the deepe&s;t, and mo&s;t artful coquettry is
employed by women of &s;uperior ta&s;te and &s;en&s;e,
to engage and fix the heart of a man whom the
world, and whom they them&s;elves e&s;teem, al|though
they are determined never to marry
him. His conver&s;ation amu&s;es them, and his at|tachment
is the highe&s;t gratification to their
vanity; nay, they can &s;ometimes be gratified
with the utter ruin of his fortune, fame, and
happine&s;s.</P>
<P>How odious mu&s;t characters of this kind ap|pear,

<P>Such a woman may always convert a lover,
if &s;he cannot give him her affections, into a warm

<P>Every &s;entiment of e&s;teem will remain; but
love, though it requires very little food, and is
ea&s;ily &s;urfeited with too much, yet it requires
&s;ome. He will view her in the light of a mar|ried
woman; and though pa&s;&s;ion &s;ub&s;ides, yet a
man of a candid and generous heart, always re|tains

If &s;he loves him &s;he &s;hould not di&s;cover to him
the full extent of her love; no, not although &s;he

otherwi&s;e the certain con&s;equence, however
concealed, is &s;atiety and di&s;gu&s;t: nature in this

<P>If &s;he &s;ees evident proofs of a gentleman's
attachment, and is determined to &s;hut her heart
again&s;t him, &s;he &s;hould treat him honourable and
humanely. She &s;hould not let him linger in a
mi&s;erable &s;u&s;pence, but be anxious to let him
know her &s;entiments with regard to him; and
this may be done by a variety of ways,&mdash;from a
certain &s;pecies of ea&s;y familiarity in behaviour
he may be &s;atisfied, if he has any di&s;cernment,
he has nothing to hope for,&mdash;from &s;ollicitou&s;ly
avoiding his company,&mdash;from the interpo&s;ition of
a common friend to explain matters to him.
But, if the&s;e methods are ineligible, opportunities
of letting him explain him&s;elf, &s;hould not be

to downright vice; but to a heart which is

the divine commands without ardour, love and

highe&s;t importance to every other part of reli|gion

to our happine&s;s. It diffu&s;es an au&s;pici|ous
influence over the whole of virtue. It is
often found a powerful in&s;trument in humanizing
the manners of men, and taming their unruly
pa&s;&s;ions. It &s;mooths what is rough, and &s;oftens
what is fierce in our nature. It is the great
purifier of the affections. It in&s;pires contempt
of the low gratifications belonging to animal
life. It promotes a humble and cheerful con|tentment
with our lot, and &s;ubdnes the eager
de&s;ire of riches and of power, which has filled

the latter blunts and deba&s;es them, and produces
a dull, cold, and &s;elfi&s;h &s;pirit. The precious &s;en|&s;ibility

<P>Sen&s;ibility, delicacy and an ingenuous temper,

dear to &s;en&s;ible hearts; they &s;hould carefully
cheri&s;h every &s;uch indication in a young female;

wanting. The preci&s;e and premature wi&s;dom,
which &s;ome girls have cunning enough to a&s;&s;ume,
is of a more dangerous tendency than any of
their natural failings can be, as it effectually
covers tho&s;e &s;ecret bad di&s;po&s;itions, which, if they
di&s;played them&s;elves, might be rectified. The

&s;hould not be di&s;regarded, even in childhood.</P>
<P>That bold, independent enterprizing &s;pirit,
which is &s;o much admired in boys, &s;hould not,
when it happens to di&s;cover it&s;elf in the other

be taught to give up their opinions betimes,
and not pertinaciou&s;ly carry on a di&s;pute, even
if they know them&s;elves to be in the right.
Yet they &s;hould not be robbed of the liberty of
private judgment, but by no means encouraged
to contract a contentious or contradictory turn.
It is of the greate&s;t importance to their future
happine&s;s, that they &s;hould acquire a &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive
temper, and a forbearing &s;pirit: for it is a le&s;|&s;on

practi&s;e, when they come abroad into

<P>There is more piety, as well as more &s;en&s;e,

for all the purpo&s;es of a &s;ocial, a happy, and an
u&s;eful life, and tho&s;e who hope to do a great

know any thing of the malignity of &s;in, the blind|ne&s;s

heart; they will al&s;o know, that the heart will
always remain after the very be&s;t po&s;&s;ible edu|cation,
full of infirmity and imperfection.&mdash;They
&s;hould con&s;ider that they are not educa|ting
cherubims and &s;eraphims, by men and

<P>Our pa&s;&s;ions them&s;elves by proper manage|ment,

not be turned to profitable account, if prudently
rectified, and &s;kilfully directed into the road of
&s;ome neighbouring virtue. Envy and lying
mu&s;t be always excepted, they mu&s;t be radically
cured before any good can be expected from
the heart which has been infected with them.
For envy, though pa&s;&s;ed through all the moral

their extinction would po&s;&s;ibly do, even if that

are friendly and beneficial when under proper

<HEAD>EFFECTS OF RELIGION.</HEAD>
<P>RELIGION prepares the mind of man for all
the events of this incon&s;tant &s;tate, in&s;tructs
him in the nature of true happine&s;s; early weans
him from an undue love of the world: afflictions
do not attack him by &s;urpri&s;e, and therefore do
not overwhelm him; he is equiped for the
&s;torm, as well as the calm, in this dubious navi|gation
of life. He is not overcome by di&s;&s;appoint|ment,
when that which is mortal dies; when
<PB N="55" REF="69">
that which is mutable begins to change; and
when that which he knew to be tran&s;ient pa&s;&s;es
away.</P>
<P>Religion not only purifies, but al&s;o fortifies
the heart, &s;o that the devout man is neither
lifted up by &s;ucce&s;s, nor enervated by &s;en&s;uality,
he meets the changes in his lot without unmanly
dejection.&mdash;He is inured to temperance and
re&s;traint.&mdash;he has learned firmne&s;s, and &s;elf-com|mand.&mdash;He
is accu&s;tomed to look up to &s;upreme
providence, not with reverence only, but with
tru&s;t and hope.</P>
<P>In pro&s;perity he cultivates his mind. Stores
it with u&s;eful knowledge, with good principles,
and virtuous di&s;po&s;itions. The re&s;ources remain
entire when the day of trouble comes. His
chief plea&s;ures are always of the calm innocent
and temperate kind, and over tho&s;e, the changes
of the world have the lea&s;t power. His mind is
a kingdom to him, and he can ever enjoy it.</P>

<P>SUPERSTITION and enthu&s;ia&s;m are two ca|pital

the one hand, attaching men with immoderate
zeal, to the ritual and external part of religion.
Enthu&s;ia&s;m, on the other, directing their whole
intention to internal emotions, and my&s;tical
communications with the &s;piritual world; while
neither the one, nor the other, has paid &s;uffi|cient
regard to the great moral duties of the
Chri&s;tian life. Indeed the horror of &s;uper&s;tition

contempt for all external in&s;titutions; whil&s;t

<HEAD>ANGER AND ENVY CONTRASTED.</HEAD>
<P>ANGER is le&s;s rea&s;onable and more &s;incere
than envy. Anger breaks out abruptly;
envy is a great prefacer: anger wi&s;hes to be
under&s;tood at once: envy if fond of remote
<PB N="57" REF="71">
hints and ambiguities; but ob&s;cure as it's oracles
are, it never cea&s;es to deliver them till they are
perfectly comprehended: anger repeats the
$word$ circumstances over again; envy invents
new ones at every fre&s;h recital: anger gives a
broken, vehement, and interrupted narrative;
envy tells a more con&s;i&s;tent, and more probable,
though a fal&s;er tale: anger is exce&s;&s;ively im|prudent,
for it is impatient to di&s;clo&s;e every
thing it knows; envy is di&s;creet for it has a
great deal to hide: anger never con&s;ults times
or &s;ea&s;ons; envy waits for the lucky moment
when the wound it meditates may be made the
mo&s;t exqui&s;itely painful, and the mo&s;t incurably
deep: anger u&s;es more invective; envy does
more mi&s;chief.</P>
<P>Simple anger &s;oon runs it&s;elf out of breath,
and is exhau&s;ted at the end of it's tale; but it
is for that cho&s;en period that envy has trea&s;ured
up the mo&s;t barbed arrow in its whole quiver:
anger puts a man out of him&s;elf; but the truly
malicious generally pre&s;erve the appearance of
&s;elf-po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, or they could not &s;o effectually
injure: anger talks loudly of its own wrongs;
envy of its adver&s;ary's inju&s;tice: anger is a vio|lent
act; envy a con&s;tant habit: no one can be
always angry, but he may be always envious.</P>
<P><PB N="58" REF="72">
An angry man's enmity (if he be generous)
will &s;ub&s;ide when the object of his re&s;entment
becomes unfortunate; but the envious man can
extract food from his malice out of calamity
it&s;elf, if he finds his adver&s;ary bears it with
dignity, or is pitied or a&s;&s;i&s;ted in it. The rage
of the pa&s;&s;ionate man is totally extingui&s;hed by
the death of his enemy; but the hatred of the
malicious is not buried even in the grave of his
rival; he will envy the good name he has left
behind him; he will envy him the tears of his
widow, the pro&s;perity of his children, the
e&s;teem of his friends, the prai&s;es of his epitaph;
nay, the very magnificence of his funeral.</P>

<HEAD>EVENTS UNCERTAIN.</HEAD>
<P>MAN walketh in a vain &s;how. His fears are
often as vain as his wi&s;hes. As what flat|tered
him in expectation, frequently wounds
him in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; &s;o that the event to which
he looked forward with an anxious and fearful
eye, has often, when it arrived, laid its terrors
a&s;ide; nay, has brought in its train unexpected
ble&s;&s;ings.</P>
<P><PB N="59" REF="73">
Both good and evil are beheld at a di&s;tance;
through a per&s;pective which deceives. The
colours of objects when nigh, are entirely dif|ferent

deceived in their pro&s;pects of happine&s;s. They
judge by the &s;en&s;ations of the pre&s;ent moment,
and in the fervour of de&s;ire pronounce confi|dently
concerning the de&s;ired object. But reflect
not that their minds, like their bodies, undergo
great alteration from the &s;ituation into which
they are thrown, and the progre&s;&s;ive &s;tages of
life through which they pa&s;s.</P>
<P>Hence, concerning any conditon which is
yet untried, they conjecture with much uncer|tainty.
In imagination they carry their pre|&s;ent
wants, inclinations, and &s;entiments into
the &s;tate of life to which they a&s;pire. But no
&s;ooner have they entered into it than their &s;en|timents
and inclinations change. New wants
and de&s;ires ari&s;e, new objects are required to
gratify them; and by con&s;equence their old di&s;|&s;atisfaction
returns, and the void which was to

<HEAD>FALSE SENTIMENT.</HEAD>
<P>THERE is a refined jargon, which has infe&s;t|ed

varni&s;h of virtue to conceal the deformity of

per&s;ons to make a je&s;t of religion, to break
through the mo&s;t &s;olemn ties and engagements,
to practi&s;e every art of latent fraud and open
&s;eduction, and yet to value them&s;elves on &s;peak|ing
and writing &s;entimentally.</P>
<P><PB N="61" REF="75">
Error is never likely to do &s;o much mi&s;chief
as when it di&s;gui&s;es its real tendency, and puts
on an engaging and attractive appearance.
Many a young woman who would be &s;hocked
at the imputation of an intrigue, is extremely
flattered at the idea of a &s;entimental connexion,
though perhaps with a dangerous and de&s;igning
man. Such an engagement will be infinitely
dearer to her vanity, than an avowed and au|thori&s;ed
attachment.</P>
<P>In order to maintain the &s;entimental cha|racter
with dignity and propriety, a woman en|tertains
the mo&s;t elevated ideas of di&s;propor|tionate
alliances, and di&s;intere&s;ted love; and
con&s;iders fortune, rank, and reputation as mere
chimerical di&s;tinctions and vulgar prejudices.
And among the many &s;mooth mi&s;chiefs of &s;enti|ment,
it is one of its &s;ure and &s;ucce&s;sful frauds
to affect the mo&s;t frigid indifference to tho&s;e
external and pecuniary advantages, which is
its great and real object to obtain.</P>
<P>A &s;entimental girl very rarely entertains any
doubt of her per&s;onal beauty; for &s;he has been
daily accu&s;tomed to contemplate it her&s;elf, and
to hear it from others. She will not, therefore,
<PB N="62" REF="76">
be very &s;olicitous for the confirmation of a truth
&s;o &s;elf-evident; but &s;he &s;u&s;pects her preten&s;ions
to under&s;tanding are more likely to be di&s;puted;
and, for that rea&s;on, greedily devours every
compliment offered to tho&s;e perfections which
are le&s;s obvious, and more refined. She is per|&s;uaded
that men need only open their eyes to
decide on her beauty; while it will be the mo&s;t
convincing proof of the ta&s;te, &s;en&s;e, and ele|gance
of her admirer that he can di&s;cern, and
flatter tho&s;e qualities in her.</P>
<P>This latent but leading foible forms a clue to
the heart; directed by this the lover affects to
overlook that beauty which attracts common
eyes: while he be&s;tows the mo&s;t delicate prai&s;es
on the beauties of the mind; and fini&s;hes the
climax of adulation by hinting &s;he is &s;uperior

<P>The&s;e &s;ublime attachments, if they end not
in &s;eduction, &s;eldom conclude delightfully, even
though they &s;hould terminate in the vulgar cata|&s;trophe

&s;oon fleets away, and the deluded godde&s;s is

<HEAD>FRIENDSHIP.</HEAD>
<P>IN young minds there is commonly a &s;trong
propen&s;ity to particular intimacies and friend|&s;hips.
Youth, indeed, is the &s;ea&s;on when friend|&s;hips
are &s;ometimes formed, which not only con|tinue
through &s;ucceeding life, but which glow
to the la&s;t, with a tenderne&s;s unknown to the
connections begun in cooler years. The pro|pen&s;ity
therefore is not to be di&s;couraged;
though at the &s;ame time, it mu&s;t be regulated
with much circum&s;pection and care.</P>
<P>Too many of the pretended friend&s;hips of
youth, are mere combinations in plea&s;ure. They
are often founded on capricious likings, &s;udden|ly
contracted, and as &s;uddenly di&s;&s;olved&punc; Some|times
they are the effect of intere&s;ted complai|&s;ance
and flattery on the one &s;ide, and of cre|dulous
fondne&s;s on the other. Such ra&s;h and dan|gerous
connections &s;hould be avoided, le&s;t they
afterwards load us with di&s;honour.</P>
<P><PB N="70" REF="84">
We &s;hould ever have it fixed in our memories,
that by the character of tho&s;e whom we choo&s;e
for our friends our own is likely to be formed,
and will certainly be judged of by the world.
We ought, therefore, to be &s;low and cautious
in contracting intimacy; but when a virtuous
friend&s;hip is once e&s;tabli&s;hed we mu&s;t ever con|&s;ider
it as a &s;acred engagement.</P>
<P>We &s;hould not expo&s;e our&s;elves to the re|proach
of lightne&s;s and incon&s;tancy; which al|ways
be&s;peak either a trifling or a ba&s;e mind.
We &s;hould not reveal any &s;ecrets of our friends;
but be faithful to his intere&s;ts. For&s;ake him
not in danger; and abhor the thought of acqui|ring
any advantage by his prejudice or hurt.</P>
<P>In the choice of friends principal regard &s;hould
be had to goodne&s;s of heart and fidelity. If
they po&s;&s;e&s;s ta&s;te and genius, that will make
them more agreeable and u&s;eful companions.
To tho&s;e who de&s;erve the name of friends we
&s;hould always unbo&s;om our&s;elves with the mo&s;t
un&s;u&s;picious confidence. An open temper, if re|&s;trained
but by tolerable prudence, will make us,
upon the whole, much happier than a &s;u&s;picious
one, although by it we may &s;ometimes &s;uffer.</P>
<P><PB N="71" REF="85">
Coldne&s;s and di&s;tru&s;t are but the too certain
con&s;equences of age and experience; but they
are unplea&s;ant feelings, and need not be antici|pated
before their time. We &s;hould never di&s;clo&s;e

<HEAD>GALLANTRY.</HEAD>
<P>THOUSANDS of women of the be&s;t hearts
and fine&s;t parts have been ruined by men
who approach them under the &s;pecious name of
friend&s;hip. But &s;uppo&s;ing a man to have the
mo&s;t undoubted honour, yet his friend&s;hip to
woman is often &s;o near a-kin to love, that if
&s;he be very agreeable in her per&s;on, &s;he will
probably very &s;oon find a lover, where &s;he wi&s;hed
only to meet a friend. Yet women &s;hould be
warned again&s;t that weakne&s;s &s;o common among
the vain, the imagination that every man who
takes particular notice of them is a lover. No|thing
can expo&s;e them more to ridicule, than ta|king
up a man on the &s;u&s;picion of being their
lover, when perhaps he never once thought
<PB N="72" REF="86">
of them in that view; and giving them&s;elves
tho&s;e airs &s;o common to &s;illy women on &s;uch oc|ca&s;ions.</P>
<P>For there is a kind of unmeaning gallantry
much practi&s;ed by &s;ome men, which, by tho&s;e
who have any di&s;cernment, will readily be found
harmle&s;s. The little ob&s;ervances, attentions
and compliments of &s;uch men &s;hould be regarded
as things of cour&s;e, which they repeat to every
agreeable woman of their acquaintance. There
is a familiarity they are apt to a&s;&s;ume, which a
proper dignity of behaviour will be ea&s;ily able to
check.</P>
<P>But there are people, who&s;e &s;entiments, and
particularly who&s;e ta&s;tes, corre&s;pond naturally,
like to a&s;&s;ociate together, although neither of
them have the mo&s;t di&s;tant view of any further
connection. But this &s;imilarity of minds often
gives ri&s;e to tenderne&s;s &s;uperior to what friend|&s;hip
demands, it will be prudent in this ca&s;e to
keep a watchful eye over our&s;elves, le&s;t our hearts

<P>He is the patron of the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed. Compa&s;|&s;ion

<P>Indu&s;try is not only the in&s;trument of im|provement,

enjoy. For it is labour only which gives reli&s;h

The acqui&s;ition of knowledge is one of the mo&s;t

of it di&s;covers a liberal mind, and is connected
with many accompli&s;hments, and may virtues.
But though our train of life &s;hould not lead us
to &s;tudy, the cour&s;e of education always fur|ni&s;hes
proper employments to a well-di&s;po&s;ed

<P>Generous ambition and &s;en&s;ibility to prai&s;e,

that any affluence of fortune, or any elevation

<HEAD>INTENT OF RELIGION.</HEAD>
<P>IF there be any principle fully a&s;certained by

for a &s;tate of trial and improvement to man.
His preparation for a better world required a
gradual purification, carried on by &s;teps of pro|gre&s;&s;ive
di&s;cipline. The &s;ituation here a&s;&s;igned him
was &s;uch as to an&s;wer this de&s;ign, by calling
forth all his active powers, by giving full &s;cope
to his moral di&s;po&s;itions, and bringing to light
his whole character. Hence it became proper,
that difficulty and temptation &s;hould ari&s;e in the
cour&s;e of his duty; ample rewards were pro|mi&s;ed
to virtue; but the&s;e rewards were left,
as yet, in ob&s;curity and di&s;tant pro&s;pect.</P>
<P>The impre&s;&s;ions of &s;en&s;e were &s;o balanced

<PB N="92" REF="106">
faith and &s;en&s;e,&mdash;between con&s;cience and
de&s;ire,&mdash;between pre&s;ent plea&s;ure and future
good. In this conflict the &s;ouls of good men
are tried,&mdash;improved and &s;trengthened:&mdash;in this
field their honours are reaped;&mdash;here are formed
the capital virtues of fortitude, temperance,
and self-denial;&mdash;moderation in pro&s;perity, pa|tience

<HEAD>LOVE OF JUSTICE.</HEAD>
<P>A SENSE of ju&s;tice &s;hould be the foundation

early intercour&s;e with the world, and even in our
mo&s;t youthful amu&s;ements, no unfairne&s;s &s;hould
be found. That &s;acred rule of doing all things
to others, according as we wi&s;h they would do
unto us, &s;hould be engraved on our minds.
For this end, we &s;hould impre&s;s our&s;elves with
a deep &s;en&s;e of the orginal, and natural equa|lity
of men.</P>
<P>Whatever advantages of birth or fortune we
po&s;&s;e&s;s, we ought never to di&s;play them with an
<PB N="93" REF="107">
o&s;tentatious &s;uperiority. We &s;hould leave the
&s;ubordinations of rank, to regulate the inter|cour&s;e
of more advanced years.&mdash;In youth it
becomes us to act among our companions, as
man with man. We &s;hould remember how un|known
to us are the vici&s;&s;itudes of the world;
and how often they, on whom ignorant and
contemptuous young men once looked down
with &s;corn, have ri&s;en to be their &s;uperiors in
future years.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>SELF-KNOWLEDGE.</HEAD>
<P>TO acquire a thorough knowledge of our|&s;elves,
is an attainment no le&s;s difficult
than important. For men are generally unwil|ling
to &s;ee their own imperfections; and when
they are willing to enquire into them, their
&s;elf-love impo&s;es upon their judgment. Their
intercour&s;e with one another a&s;&s;i&s;ts their delu|&s;ion,
to which, of them&s;elves, they are prone.</P>
<P>For the ordinary commerce of the world, is
a commerce of flattery and fal&s;ehood; where
reciprocality they deceive and are deceived,
<PB N="94" REF="108">
where every one appears under an a&s;&s;umed
form, profe&s;&s;es e&s;teem, which he does not feel,
and be&s;tows prai&s;e in order to receive it.</P>
<P>There are three characters which every man
&s;u&s;tains; and the&s;e often extremely different
from one another. One which he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es is
his own opinion;&mdash;another, which he carries in
e&s;timation of the world;&mdash;and a third, which he
bears in the judgment of God:&mdash;it is only the la&s;t
which a&s;certains what he really is. Whether
the character which the world forms of him,
be above or below truth, it imports not much
to know. But it is of eternal con&s;equence, that
the character which a man po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es in his own
eyes, be formed upon that which he bears in
the &s;ight of God.</P>
<P>He &s;hould enquire, after laying a&s;ide all par|tiality
for him&s;elf, and exploring the heart with
&s;uch accurate &s;crutiny, as may bring all hidden
defects to light, whether he be not con&s;cious,
that the fair opinion which the world entertains
of him, is founded on their partial knowledge,
both of his abilities and virtues.&mdash;He &s;hould be
willing that all his actions &s;hould be publicly
canva&s;&s;ed.&mdash;He &s;hould bear to have his thoughts
laid open.</P>
<P><PB N="95" REF="109">
When he has kept from vice, it &s;hould be
known whether his innocence proceeded from
purity of principle, or from worldly motives;
&mdash;whether any malignity or envy ri&s;es within
him, when he compares his own condition with
that of others.&mdash;He &s;hould enquire whether
he has been as &s;ollicitous to regulate his heart, as
to pre&s;erve his manners from reproach;&mdash;pro|fe&s;&s;ing
him&s;elf a Chri&s;tian, whether the &s;pirit of
Chri&s;t has appeared in his conduct;&mdash;declaring
that he hopes for immortality, whether that
hope &s;urmounted undue attachment to the pre|&s;ent
life.</P>
<P>Such inve&s;tigation, &s;eriou&s;ly pur&s;ued, may
produce to every man many di&s;coveries of him|&s;elf;
di&s;coveries, not plea&s;ing, perhaps, to va|nity,
but &s;alutary and u&s;eful. For he can only
be a flatterer, but no true friend to him&s;elf,
who aims not at knowing his own defects, as

<HEAD>CHEERFULNESS OF OLD AGE, AND LE|VITY

<P>CHEERFULNESS, in old age, is graceful. It
is the natural concomitant of virtue. But
this is widely different from the levity of youth.
Many things are allowable in that early period,
which, in maturer years, would de&s;erve cen&s;ure;
but which in old age, become both ridiculous
and criminal.&mdash;By awkwardly affecting to imitate
the manners, and to mingle in the vanities of the
young; as the aged depart from the dignity,
&s;o they forfeit the privileges of grey hairs.
But if by follies of this kind they are degraded,
they are expo&s;ed to much deeper blame, by
de&s;cending to vicious plea&s;ure, and continuing
to hover round tho&s;e &s;inful gratifications to
which they were once addicted.</P>
<P>Amu&s;ement and relaxation the aged require
and may enjoy: but they &s;hould con&s;ider well by

<HEAD>PUBLIC LIFE,

<P>HE who lives always in public cannot live to
his own &s;oul. Conver&s;ation and inter|cour&s;e
with the world is, in &s;everal re&s;pects, an
education for vice. From earlie&s;t youth we are
accu&s;tomed to hear riches and honour extolled
as the chief po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of man, and propo&s;ed to
us as the principal aim of our future pur&s;uits.
We are trained up to look with admiration on
the flattering marks of di&s;tinction which they
be&s;tow. In que&s;t of tho&s;e fancied ble&s;&s;ings, we

profit.</P>
<P>The &s;oft names and plau&s;ible colours under
which deceit, &s;en&s;uality, and revenge are pre|&s;ented

good and evil. We often meet with
crimes authorized by high examples, and re|warded
with the care&s;&s;es and &s;miles of the

<HEAD>LOVE.</HEAD>
<P>WHAT is commonly called love among&s;t the

to the man who prefers any individual to
the re&s;t of the &s;ex; &s;uch a man &s;he often marries
with little of either per&s;onal e&s;teem or affection.
Indeed without an unu&s;ual &s;hare of natural &s;en|&s;ibility,
and very peculiar good fortune, a woman
in this country has very little probability of
marrying for love.</P>
<P>For love is not to begin on the part of the fe|male,
but entirely to be the con&s;equence of a
man's attachment to her. Nature has therefore
as wi&s;ely and benevolently a&s;&s;igned to the tender
&s;ex, a greater flexibility of ta&s;te on this subject.</P>
<P><PB N="99" REF="113">
Some agreeable qualities recommend a gentle|man
to common good liking, and friend&s;hip.
In the cour&s;e of acquaintance, he contracts an
attachment. When a woman perceives it, it
excites her gratitude; this ri&s;es into preference,
and this preference, perhaps, at la&s;t advances to
&s;ome degree of attachment, e&s;pecially if it
meets with cro&s;&s;es and difficulties; for the&s;e,

<HEAD>MARRIAGE.</HEAD>
<P>THERE is nothing which renders a woman

to happine&s;s to be married. Be&s;ides the
gro&s;s indelicacy of the &s;entiment, it is a fal&s;e
one, as thou&s;ands of women have experienced.
But a married &s;tate, if entered into from pro|per
motives of e&s;teem and affection, is the hap|pie&s;t,
makes women the mo&s;t re&s;pectable in the
eyes of the world, and the mo&s;t u&s;eful members
of &s;ociety. Care &s;hould be taken not to relin|qui&s;h
the ea&s;e and independence of a &s;ingle life,
to become the &s;laves of a fool, or a tyrant's
caprice.</P>
<P>Love is very &s;eldom produced at fir&s;t &s;ight;
at lea&s;t, in that ca&s;e, it mu&s;t have a very un|ju&s;tifiable
foundation. True love is founded on
e&s;teem, in a corre&s;pondence of ta&s;tes and &s;enti|ments,
and &s;teals on the heart imperceptibly.
Therefore, before the affections come to be in
the lea&s;t engaged to any man, women &s;hould
examine their tempers, their ta&s;tes, and their
<PB N="113" REF="127">
hearts. <HI>very &s;everely;</HI> and &s;ettle in their own
minds, what are the requi&s;ites to their happi|ne&s;s
in a married &s;tate; and, as it is almo&s;t im|po&s;&s;ible
that they &s;hould get every thing they
wi&s;h, they &s;hould come to a &s;teady determina|tion
what they are to confider as e&s;&s;ential, and
what may be &s;acrificed.</P>
<P>Should they have hearts di&s;po&s;ed by nature
for love and friend&s;hip, and po&s;&s;e&s;s tho&s;e feel|ings
which enable them to enter into all the re|finements
and delicacies of the&s;e attachments,
matters &s;hould be well con&s;idered before they
give them any indulgence.</P>
<P>Should they have the misfortune to have &s;uch
tempers, and &s;uch &s;entiments deeply rooted in
them; &s;hould they have &s;pirit and re&s;olution to
re&s;i&s;t the &s;ollicitations of vanity, the per&s;ecution
of friends: and can they &s;upport the pro&s;pect of
the many inconveniences attending the &s;tate of
an old maid, then they may indulge them&s;elves
in that kind of &s;entimental reading and con|ver&s;ation,
which is mo&s;t corre&s;pondent to their
feelings.</P>
<P>But if it is found, on a &s;trict &s;elf-examination,
that marriage is ab&s;olutely e&s;&s;ential to their
<PB N="114" REF="128">
happine&s;s, the &s;ecret &s;hould be kept inviolable
in their own bo&s;oms;&mdash;but they &s;hould &s;hun,
as they would do the mo&s;t fatal poi&s;on, all that
&s;pecies of reading and conver&s;ation, which
warms the imagination, which engages and
&s;oftens the heart, and rai&s;es the ta&s;te above the
leavel of common life. If they do otherwi&s;e,
let them con&s;ider the terrible conflict of pa&s;|&s;ions
this may afterwards rai&s;e in their brea&s;ts.</P>
<P>If this refinement once takes deep root in
their minds, and they do not mean to obey its
dictates, but marry from vulgar and mercenary
views, they may never be able to eradicate it
entirely, and then it will embitter all their mar|ried
days. In&s;tead of meeting with &s;en&s;e,&mdash;ten|derne&s;s,&mdash;delicacy,&mdash;a
lover,&mdash;a friend,&mdash;an
equal companion in an hu&s;band, they may be
tried with in&s;ipidity and dulne&s;s;&mdash;&s;hocked with
indelicacy;&mdash;and mortified by indifference.</P>
<P>To avoid the&s;e complicated evils, joined to
others which may ari&s;e from the opinion of the
world relative to the infelicity thence ari&s;ing;
women, who are determined, at all events, to
marry, &s;hould have all their reading and amu&s;e|ments
of &s;uch a kind, as do not affect the heart nor

the imagination, except in the way of wit and
humour.</P>
<P>Whatever are a woman's views in marrying,
&s;he &s;hould take every po&s;&s;ible precaution to pre|vent
being di&s;appointed. If fortune, and the
plea&s;ure it brings be her aims, the principal &s;e|curity
&s;he can have for this will depend on her
marrying a good natured, generous man; who
de&s;pi&s;es money, and who will let her live where
&s;he can be&s;t enjoy that plea&s;ure, that pomp, and
parade of life for which &s;he married him.</P>
<P>In order to en&s;ure felicity, it is difficult to
point out in the married &s;tate the mo&s;t effectual
method; nor can we advi&s;e whom a woman
&s;hould marry, but we may with great confi|dence
advi&s;e whom &s;he &s;hould not marry.</P>
<P>A companion that may entail and hereditary
di&s;ea&s;e on po&s;terity, particularly madne&s;s &s;hould
be avoided. Such ri&s;que is the height of impru|dence
and highly criminal.</P>
<P>A woman &s;hould not marry a fool; he is the
mo&s;t <HI>intractable</HI> of all animals; he is led by his
pa&s;&s;ions and caprices, and is incapable of hear|ing
<PB N="116" REF="130">
the voice of rea&s;on. Be&s;ides it may probably
too hurt a woman's vanity to have an hu&s;band,
for whom &s;he has rea&s;on to blu&s;h and tremble
every time he opens his lips in company.</P>
<P>But the wor&s;t circum&s;tance that attends a fool,
in his con&s;tant jealou&s;y of his wife's being thought
to govern him. This renders it impo&s;&s;ible to
lead him; and he is continually doing ab&s;urd
and di&s;agreeable things, for not other rea&s;on but
to &s;hew he dare to them.</P>
<P>A rake is always a &s;u&s;picious hu&s;band, be|cau&s;e
he has only known the mo&s;t worthle&s;s of
the &s;ex.</P>
<P>Women, who have a &s;en&s;e or religion, &s;hould
not think of hu&s;bands who have none. If they
have tolerable under&s;tandings, they will be glad
that their wives have religion, for their own
&s;akes, and for the &s;ake of their familes; but it will
&s;ink them in their e&s;teem.</P>

<HEAD>OLD AGE.</HEAD>
<P>OLD Age is a &s;tage of the human cour&s;e,
which every one hopes to reach; it is a pe|riod
ju&s;tly entitled to general re&s;pect. Even
its failings ought to be touched with a gentle

by &s;upplying occupation to the mind.</P>
<P>Old age begins its advances by di&s;qualifying
men either from reli&s;hing the one, or for taking
an active part in the other; while it withdraws
their accu&s;tomed &s;upports, it impo&s;es, at the &s;ame

<P>In the former &s;tages of their journey, hope
continued to flatter them with many a fair and
enticing pro&s;pect; but as old age increa&s;es
the&s;e illu&s;ions vani&s;h.&mdash;Life is contracted within
a narrow and barren circle.&mdash;Year after year
&s;teals &s;omewhat away from their &s;tore of com|fort,&mdash;deprives
them of &s;ome of their antient

incapacitates them for &s;ome function

<P>The querulous temper, to them imputed, is to
be con&s;idered as a natural infirmity rather than
a vice: the &s;ame apology cannot be made for

declining years.</P>
<P>It is too common to find the aged at declared
enmity with the whole &s;y&s;tem of pre&s;ent cu&s;|toms

He &s;hould acquire an intere&s;t in divine favour;

<HEAD>SELF COMMUNION</HEAD>
<P>AS recommended by men of virtue and true

<P>By this the pious man walks among the vari|ous

the giddy crowd are &s;trangers. A certain odour
of &s;anctity remains upon his mind, which, for

world.</P>
<P>As he views the world with the eye of a chri&s;|tian
he will &s;ee, that however men appear to move
and act after their own plea&s;ure, they are never|thele&s;s
retained in &s;ecret bonds by the Almighty;

thou&s;ands, from race to race, continue to &s;plit.
The love of plea&s;ure, natural to man in every

ardour.&mdash;Novelty adds fre&s;h charms, as yet,
<PB N="165" REF="179">
to every gratification.&mdash;The world appears to

amount? They may all be comprized in few
words, not to hurt our&s;elves, and not to hurt
others by our pur&s;uit of plea&s;ure, and tho&s;e will
be fully effected by temperance. Within the&s;e

<P>Hence by this virtue we are not called to re|nounce
plea&s;ure, but to enjoy it in &s;afety.&mdash;In|&s;tead
of abridging it, we are exhorted to pur|&s;ue
it on an exten&s;ive plan; we have mea&s;ures

found &s;ome thorn &s;pring to wound us; &s;ome

<HEAD>TRUE GENUINE SENTIMENT.</HEAD>
<P>TRUE genuine &s;entiment may be &s;o connected

is &s;o far from being di&s;agreeable, that a
portion is indi&s;pen&s;ibly nece&s;&s;ary in an engaging

and be cheri&s;hed by a virtuous education, not
compounded of irregular pa&s;&s;ions and artificially
refined by books of unnatural fiction, and impro|bable
adventure.</P>
<P>But this dangerous merit cannot be too rigid|ly

<PB N="167" REF="181">
po&s;&s;e&s;s it into inconveniencies from which
le&s;s intere&s;ting characters are happily exempt.
Strong &s;en&s;ibility may carry a very amiable tem|per

&s;uffer them&s;elves to feel a rea&s;onable preference,
before it &s;trengthens into a violent attachment.</P>
<P>When an innocent girl of this open, tru&s;ting,
tender hearty happens to meet with one of her
own &s;ex and age, who&s;e addre&s;s and manners

de&s;ire to commence a friendship with her.
&mdash;She feels the mo&s;t lively impatience at the re|&s;traint
of company and the decorums of ceremony.
&mdash;She longs to be alone with her,&mdash;longs to a&s;&s;ure
her of the warmth of her tenderne&s;s,&mdash;and gene|rally
a&s;cribes to the fair &s;tranger all the good
qualities &s;he feels in her own heart, or rather all
tho&s;e which &s;he has met with in her reading,
di&s;per$ed in a variety of heroines.&mdash;She is per|&s;uaded
that her new friend unites them all in
her&s;elf, becau&s;e &s;he carries in her prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing
countenance the promi&s;e of them all.</P>
<P>If hints of her defects are given, &s;he mi&s;takes
the voice of di&s;cretion for the in&s;inuation of an
<PB N="168" REF="182">
uncharitable di&s;po&s;ition. At fir&s;t &s;he li&s;tens to
them with a generous impatience, and after|wards
with a cold and &s;ilent di&s;dain, and de|&s;pi&s;es
them as the effect of prejudice mi&s;repre|&s;entation,
or ignorance.</P>
<P>Yet this tru&s;ting confidence, this hone&s;t indi&s;|cretion,
is, at this early period of life, as amia|ble
as it is natural; and will, if <HI>wi&s;ely</HI> cultivated,
produce, at its proper &s;ea&s;on, fruits infinitely
more valuable than all the guarded circum&s;pec|tion
of premature, and therefore artificial pru|dence.
Nay, if the younger part of the &s;ex are
&s;ometimes deceived in the choice of a friend, they
enjoy even then an higher degree of &s;atisfaction
than if they never tru&s;ted.&mdash;For to be always
clad in the burthen&s;ome armour of &s;u&s;picion is
more painful and inconvenient, than to run the
hazard of &s;uffering, now and then, a tran&s;ient in|jury.</P>
<P>The&s;e ob&s;ervations chiefly re&s;pect the inex|perienced;
for it is a certainty that women are
capable of as faithful and as durable friend&s;hip
as any of the other &s;ex. They can enter not

<HEAD>GOVERNMENT OF TEMPER.</HEAD>
<P>EVERY human creature is &s;en&s;ible of the pro|pen&s;ities

it &s;hould be his care to correct and &s;ubdue;
particularly in the early period of life; el&s;e,
when arrived at a &s;tate of maturity, he may
relap&s;e into tho&s;e faults which were originally in
his nature, and which will require to be dili|gently
watched, and kept under, through the
whole cour&s;e of life;&mdash;for the cultivation of an
amiable di&s;po&s;ition is a great part of religious
duty; &s;ince nothing leads more directly to the
breach of charity, and to the injury and mo|le&s;tation
of our fellow-creatures, than the in|dulgence
of an ill temper.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to a woman, the principal vir|tues
and vices mu&s;t be of a dome&s;tic kind.&mdash;
Within the circle of her own family and de|pendents
lies her &s;phere of action&mdash;the &s;cene
of almo&s;t all tho&s;e ta&s;ks and trials, which mu&s;t
<PB N="170" REF="184">
determine her character and her fate here and
hereafter.&mdash;The happine&s;s of her hu&s;band, chil|dren,
and &s;ervants, mu&s;t depend on her temper;
and it will appear, that the greate&s;t good or
evil which &s;he may ever have in her power to
do, may ari&s;e from her correcting or indulging
its infirmities.</P>
<P>The greatest outward ble&s;&s;ings cannot afford
enjoyment to a mind unea&s;y and ruffled within.
&mdash;A fit of ill humour will &s;poil the fine&s;t enter|tainment,
and is as real a torment as the mo&s;t
painful di&s;ea&s;e.&mdash;Another unavoidable con&s;e|quence
of ill temper, is the di&s;like and aver&s;ion
of all who are witne&s;&s;es to it; and, perhaps, the
deep and la&s;ting re&s;entments of tho&s;e who &s;uffer
from its effects.</P>
<P>We all, from &s;ocial and &s;elf-love, earne&s;tly
de&s;ire the e&s;teem and affection of our fellow-creatures;
and indeed our condition renders
them &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to us, that the wretch, who
has forfeited them, mu&s;t feel de&s;olate and un|done&mdash;deprived
of all the be&s;t enjoyments and
comforts the world can afford&mdash;and given up to
his inward mi&s;ery, unpitied and &s;corned.</P>
<P><PB N="171" REF="185">
Every temper is inclined, in &s;ome degree, to
pa&s;&s;ion, peevishne&s;s, or ob&s;tinacy: we &s;hould
therefore always watch the bent of our nature,
and apply remedies proper for the infirmities to
which we are mo&s;t liable.&mdash;The fir&s;t is &s;o injuri|ous
to &s;ociety, and &s;o odious in it&s;elf, that men
who give way to it render them&s;elves, not only
di&s;gu&s;ting, but dangerous:&mdash;hurried on by the
violence of rage, they break through the bounds

di&s;regard truth&mdash;&s;acrifice ju&s;tice&mdash;and di&s;grace,
as well as offend, the dignity of their Creator.</P>
<P>In a female character, one &s;hould think that
&s;hame alone would be &s;ufficient to pre&s;erve a
young woman from becoming a &s;lave to it; for
it is as unbecoming her character to be betrayed
into ill behaviour by pa&s;&s;ion, as by intoxication;
and &s;he ought to be a&s;hamed of the one, as
much as the other.&mdash;Gentlene&s;s,&mdash;meekne&s;s,&mdash;
and <HI>patience,</HI> are her peculiar di&s;tinctions, and
<HI>an enraged woman is one of the mo&s;t di&s;gu&s;ting
&s;ights in nature.</HI></P>
<P>The placid countenance&mdash;the mild deport|ment
&mdash;and a &s;mooth addre&s;s, are &s;trong incen|tives
to ju&s;t admiration, and to hone&s;t prai&s;e.&mdash;
<PB N="172" REF="186">
But the&s;e perfections all fall victims to that
mon&s;ter pa&s;&s;ion.&mdash;It behoves us therefore to re|tire
from &s;uch an occa&s;ion of &s;in,&mdash;and wait
till we are cool, before we pre&s;ume to judge
of what has pa&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>By accu&s;toming our&s;elves thus to conquer and
di&s;appoint our anger, we &s;hall, by degrees, find
it grow weak and manageable, so as to leave
our rea&s;on at liberty.&mdash;We &s;hall be able to re|&s;train
our tongue from evil, and our looks and
ge&s;tures from all expre&s;&s;ions of violence and ill|will.</P>
<P>Pride, which produces so many evils in the

Whoever cultivates in him&s;elf a proper humi|lity,&mdash;a

a due re&s;pect for others, will
find but &s;mall temptation to violent or unrea|&s;onable
anger.</P>
<P>Whenever, therefore, we feel our&s;elves high|ly
enraged, we &s;hould &s;u&s;pect our&s;elves to be
in the wrong, and re&s;olve to &s;tand the delibe|rate
deci&s;ion of our own con&s;cience before we ca&s;t

upon another the puni&s;hment which is perhaps
due to our&s;elves.&mdash;This &s;elf-examination will,
at lea&s;t, give us time to cool, and, if we are
ju&s;t, as it &s;hould be our chief aim to be &s;o, will
di&s;po&s;e us to balance our own wrong with that
of our antagoni&s;t, and to &s;ettle the account
with him on equal terms.</P>
<P>There are many who acquire the character
of ill-temper, when in reality they merit not the
&s;everity of the accu&s;ation; and this ari&s;es mere|ly
from their mode of replication, or their man|ner
of interrogating&mdash;as they are generally and
unfortunately attended with a &s;pecies of tart|ne&s;s
on every trivial occa&s;ion.&mdash;This indicates
to common ob&s;ervers a degree of petulance, and
&s;eems to take its origin from a jealou&s;y, or ra|ther
fear of their own con&s;equence being de|graded
or injured in &s;ome re&s;pect.&mdash;This &s;hould
be carefully avoided, for the very appearance
of peevi&s;hne&s;s, is ungraceful and painful.</P>
<P>The fretful man, though he injures us le&s;s,
di&s;gu&s;ts us more than him who is pa&s;&s;ionate:&mdash;

on trifles,&mdash;and engro&s;&s;ed by a paltry &s;elf-love,
<PB N="174" REF="188">
which knows not how to bear the appre|hen&s;ion

enduring inconveniences, we &s;hall ha|bituate
our&s;elves to bear them with ea&s;e, and
good humour, when occa&s;ioned by others.</P>
<P>We &s;hould endeavour, by denying our&s;elves
now and then innocent indulgences, to ac|quire
a habit of command over our pa&s;&s;ions
and inclinations, particularly &s;uch as are
likely to lead us into evil; and ab&s;tract our
minds from that attention to trifling circum|&s;tances,
which u&s;ually creates this unea&s;ine&s;s.&mdash;
Our minds &s;hould, therefore, have always &s;ome
objects in pur&s;uit worthy of them, that they
may not be engro&s;&s;ed by &s;uch, as are in them|&s;elves

<P>THE things in our own power, are in their

or hindered; but tho&s;e that are not
in our power are feeble, &s;ervile, liable to oppo&s;ition,
and not ours, but anothers.</P>
<P>When any frightful and di&s;couraging imagi|nations

and meet it boldly, with this reflection, that it
is only our apprehension of things, and not the
real nature of the things them&s;elves.</P>
<P>We &s;hould, on all occa&s;ions, reflect with our|&s;elves,
of what nature and condition tho&s;e things
are, that mini&s;ter delight, or are u&s;eful and be|neficial
to us, and that we have a natural tend|ency

beginning at the &s;lighte&s;t and mo&s;t incon&s;iderable
things, and &s;o ri&s;e to the higher and more va|lauble.</P>
<P>In every action we undertake, we &s;hould con|&s;ider
fir&s;t with our&s;elves, and weigh well the na|ture
and circum&s;tances of the thing; nay,
though it be a &s;light one repre&s;ent to our&s;elves
what accident we may probably meet with, and
determine to pre&s;erve our minds and rea&s;son un|di&s;turbed
&mdash;by which means we &s;hall be guarded again&s;t their di&s;agreeable effects; which never
can be done, if we &s;uffer every one to di&s;com|po&s;e
us.</P>
<P>That which gives men di&s;quiet, and makes
their lives mi&s;erable, is not the nature of things
as they really are, but the notions and opinions
which they form to them&s;elves concerning them.&mdash;wherever
therefore we meet with ob&s;tructions
and perplexities&mdash;and fall into them, let us be
ju&s;t, and not lay the blame where it is not due;
but impute it all to our&s;elves, and our prijudi|cate
opinions.</P>
<P>We &s;hould never be exalted with any excel|lence
that is not properly our own.&mdash;We &s;hould
<PB N="201" REF="215">
content our&s;elves with making a right u&s;e of
our own ideas, and when we manage the&s;e as
we ought, we may be allowed to plea&s;e our|&s;elves;
for this is being exalted with &s;ome ex|cellence
that is properly ours.</P>
<P>Let us not trouble our&s;elves with wi&s;hing that
things may be ju&s;t as we would have them; but
well plea&s;ed that they &s;hould be ju&s;t as they are,
then we &s;hall live ea&s;y.</P>
<P>Upon every fre&s;h accident we ought to turn
our eyes inward, and examine how we are qua|lified
to encounter it,&mdash;and prepare our&s;elves to
meet it with patience and re&s;olution&mdash;If we u&s;e
our&s;elves to the&s;e, by begrees no accident what|ever
will be able to &s;urprize or &s;ubdue us.</P>
<P>Our con&s;tant care &s;hould be to behave our|&s;elves
in the affairs of human life, with the
&s;ame decency as at a public entertainment&mdash;If
any thing be offered us, we &s;hould receive it;
with mode&s;ty; if it pa&s;s by us, and be &s;ent to
another, let us not withhold it from him, or keep
what was not intended us; if it be not come
down to us, let us not &s;hew our&s;elves eager nor
<PB N="202" REF="216">
&s;natch at it greedily, but wait patiently till it
comes to our turn.&mdash;In ca&s;e of riches, honour,
power or preferment, we &s;hould manage our|&s;elves
in the &s;ame manner: it will render us
plea&s;ing to man, and acceptable to God.</P>
<P>The world we &s;hould con&s;ider as a theatre,
that our parts in this play of life is determined
by the poet; upon him it mu&s;t depend whether
we &s;hall act a long or &s;hort one; whether our
characters &s;hall be high or low;&mdash;if therefore
he a&s;&s;igns us that of a beggar, we mu&s;t be care|ful
to humour it well;&mdash;if a cripple&mdash;or a
prince&mdash;or a private ob&s;cure man, and whatever
it be, we mu&s;t make the be&s;t of it.&mdash;The play|ing
of the parts commendably depends on our|&s;elves
&mdash;the giving them out, and choo&s;ing the
actors is not ours but another per&s;on's.</P>
<P>It is always in our power to come off conque|rors,
provided we will never engage in any
combats, but &s;uch who&s;e &s;ucce&s;&s;es will be deter|mined
by our own choice.</P>
<P>If we &s;ee any per&s;on advanced to an eminent
&s;tation of honour and power, or any other kind
<PB N="203" REF="217">
of pro&s;perity, we &s;hould avoid being pre&s;ently
&s;urprized with a fal&s;e idea of his condition, nor
ra&s;hly pronounce him happy;&mdash;for if all the
happine&s;s and tranquillity of our minds depend
upon things within our own power, there can
be no room for envy of emulation.</P>
<P>When any man reviles of &s;trikes us we &s;hould
con&s;ider that it is not the tongue that gives us
the opprobrious language, or the hand that deals
the blow that injures or affronts us; but it is
our own re&s;entment of it, as an injury or af|front,
that makes if &s;uch to us; the provoca|tion
is entirely owing to our own apprehen&s;ions
which &s;wells us into revenge.</P>
<P>It is nece&s;&s;ary to keep all tho&s;e calamities, of
which mankind are mo&s;t afraid, con&s;tantly be|fore
our eyes, and let them be familiar to our
minds; but above all, death &s;hould be ever pre|&s;ent
there;&mdash;it is an excellent remedy again&s;t
ba&s;e and mean thoughts, and a powerful re&s;traint
to all immoderate de&s;ires.</P>
<P>If we re&s;olve to make wi&s;dom and virtue the
&s;tudy and bu&s;ine&s;s of our lives, we mu&s;t be &s;ure
<PB N="204" REF="218">
to arm our&s;elves beforehand again&s;t all the in|conveniencies
and di&s;couragements that are like
to attend this re&s;olution.&mdash;We &s;hall meet with
many &s;coffs and much deri&s;ion&mdash;but let us not be
affected, or &s;upercilious; only &s;tick clo&s;e to
whatever we are in our judgment convinced is
virtuous and becoming&mdash;and con&s;ider this as our
proper &s;tation a&s;&s;igned by God, which we mu&s;t
not quit upon any terms; and remember,
that if we per&s;evere in goodne&s;s, tho&s;e very
men who derided us at fir&s;t, will afterwards
turn our admirers;&mdash;but if we give way to
their reproaches, and are vanqui&s;hed by them,
we &s;hall render our&s;elves doubly, and mo&s;t de|&s;ervedly
ridiculous.</P>
<P>If we ever happen to accommodate our&s;elves
to the humour of the world, for the &s;ake of re|putation
and applau&s;e;&mdash;we &s;hould take notice
that it is below a philo&s;opher:&mdash;and therefore
content our&s;elves upon all occa&s;ions with really
being what we would be thought&mdash;but if we
will need be thought &s;o too, we should de&s;erve
our own good opinion: that will be &s;ufficient.</P>
<P>If we ob&s;erve &s;ome other per&s;on more care&s;&s;ed
than our&s;elves;&mdash;invited to entertainments when
<PB N="205" REF="219">
we are left out;&mdash;&s;aluted before we are
taken notice of;&mdash;thought more proper to ad|vi&s;e
with, and his coun&s;el followed rather than
ours;&mdash;we &s;hould con&s;ider whether the&s;e re|&s;pects
paid to him are good things, or evil;&mdash;if
they de&s;erve to be e&s;teemed good, this ought
to be matter of joy to us;&mdash;but if they be evil,
how unrea&s;onable is it to be troubled becau&s;e
they have not fallen to our &s;hare.</P>
<P>We &s;hould con&s;ider with our&s;elves &s;eriou&s;ly,
what figure is mo&s;t fit for us to make in the
world; and then fix upon a method and rule
in order hereunto: which we &s;hould be &s;ure to
ob&s;erve nicely, both at home alone, and abroad
in company.</P>
<P>One of our principal rules &s;hould be &s;ilence;&mdash;and
when we di&s;cour&s;e, confine our&s;elves to &s;uch
&s;ubjects as are nece&s;&s;ary, and expre&s;s our &s;en&s;e
in as few words as po&s;&s;ible. Loquacity is a mo&s;t
impertinent intruder on &s;ociety; and many
u&s;ele&s;s words, though the pride of the &s;peaker,
the de&s;truction of his con&s;equence,&mdash;an un|pardonable
infringement on the laws of good-breeding,&mdash;and
a fatigue to his auditors.</P>
<P><PB N="206" REF="220">
Whenever we happen into company, where
we have authority, and influence enough to do
it, we &s;hould try to change the di&s;cour&s;e if unin|&s;tructive,
unentertaining, or offen&s;ive, and bring
it to becoming &s;ubjects:&mdash;but if we are among
people of another temper, &s;uch as will not en|dure
re&s;traint or reproof, then it behoves us to
hold our own tongues.</P>
<P>Loud laughing is a mark of ill-breeding&mdash;laughing
at our own jokes, too oft the effect of
ignorance:&mdash;we &s;hould not indulge even in
laughing at all but upon few occa&s;ions, and then
it &s;hould not be much.</P>
<P>If po&s;&s;ible we &s;hould avoid &s;wearing altoge|ther,
it is vulgar and impious&mdash;but if we can|not
do that ab&s;olutely, we &s;hould be &s;ure to de|cline
it as much as is in our power.</P>
<P>All public entertainments and mixed compa|nies
without they are calculated to produce in|nocent
amu&s;ement, improve the under&s;tanding,
or poli&s;h the manners, &s;hould be declined:&mdash;but
if any extraordinary occa&s;ion calls us to them,
we &s;hould keep a &s;trict guard upon our&s;elves,
<PB N="207" REF="221">
le&s;t we &s;hould be infected with rude and vulgar
conver&s;ation; for though a man be never &s;o
clear him&s;elf, yet, by frequenting company
that are tainted, he will of nece&s;&s;ity contract
&s;ome pollution from them.</P>
<P>U&s;e and nece&s;&s;ity &s;hould be the rule of all the
provi&s;ions we make for the body&mdash;we &s;hould
choo&s;e meat and drink&mdash;apparel&mdash;hou&s;e&mdash;and
retinue of &s;uch kinds, and in &s;uch proportions
as will mo&s;t conduce to the&s;e purpo&s;es.&mdash;but as
for all beyond this, which mini&s;ters to vanity
and luxury, let us retrench and de&s;pi&s;e.</P>
<P>To render us truly amiable, in the &s;ight of
the ju&s;t and virtuous, nothing, however it may be
laughed at by the di&s;&s;olute, contributes &s;o much
to that end as cha&s;tity,&mdash;but how perfect &s;o|ever
ours may be, the conceit of this &s;hould not
make us trouble&s;ome to others, that are more
frail; nor &s;hould we be too lavi&s;h in either re|proving
their failings, nor in commendation of
our own virtue.</P>
<P>If we happen to be told at any time, that
another per&s;on hath &s;poken ill of us, we &s;hould
<PB N="208" REF="222">
never trouble our&s;elves to confute the report,
or excu&s;e the thing without being publicly cal|led
forth, and the pre&s;ervation of character
makes it nece&s;&s;ary;&mdash;but rather put all up with
this reply,&mdash;that we have &s;everal faults be&s;ides
that, and if he had known us more, he would
have &s;poken wor&s;e.&mdash;</P>
<P>In familiar conver&s;ations with our friends
and acquaintance, we &s;hould never make it our
bu&s;ine&s;s to entertain the company with tedious
narratives of our&s;elves, or our own affairs&mdash;The
exploits by which we have &s;ignalized our|&s;elves,&mdash;the
&s;ucce&s;&s;es we have obtained,&mdash;the
dangers we have encountered&mdash;or the afflictions
we have undergone, may be very
agreeable &s;tories for us to tell; yet they will
not be equally &s;o for others to hear.</P>
<P>It will not become us to render our&s;elves the
common buffoon, and be always trying to make
a company laugh; for this is a nice and very
tickli&s;h thing, exceeding apt to degenerate into
vice and folly&mdash;and he that only &s;tudies men's
diver&s;ion, &s;hall be &s;ure at the &s;ame time to lo&s;e
their re&s;pect.</P>
<P><PB N="209" REF="223">
Of all kinds of di&s;cour&s;e, none is more un&s;afe,&mdash;none
more de&s;picable than that which breaks
in upon mode&s;ty and good manners.&mdash;Wherever
therefore any per&s;on flies out into ob&s;cenity, if
such a liberty dare be taken, we &s;hould reprove
him publicly, and put a &s;top to his lewd conver|&s;ation;&mdash;but
if that cannot conveniently be
done, yet at lea&s;t we may do our&s;elves the
ju&s;tice to di&s;approve it; and by forbearing
to join with him&mdash;by blu&s;hing for him&mdash;and by
chiding looks, let all the company &s;ee plainly,
that we dete&s;t his filthy ribaldry.</P>
<P>When the idea of any plea&s;ure &s;trikes our
imagination, as we mu&s;t on other occa&s;ions, &s;o
&s;hould we in this, e&s;pecially &s;tand upon our
guard, and not &s;uffer our&s;elves to be hurried
away with the impetuous torrent;&mdash;we &s;hould
not run eagerly upon enjoyment, nor improve
the thought into action;&mdash;but take time to con|&s;ider,
and let that time be employed in making
a ju&s;t computation between the duration of the
plea&s;ure, and that of the repentance &s;ure to
follow it; and then we &s;hall not fail to check
our inclinations, and chide our&s;elves for indulg|ing
them in any degree at all.</P>
<P><PB N="210" REF="224">
When upon mature deliberation we are per|&s;uaded
a thing is fit to be done&mdash;let us do it
boldly, and not affect privacy in it, nor con|cern
our&s;elves at all what impertinent cen&s;ures,
or reflections the world may pa&s;s upon it; for
if the thing be ju&s;t and innocent, it is fooli&s;h to
&s;tand in fear of tho&s;e, who will them&s;elves do
ill in cen&s;uring and condemning what we do
well.</P>
<P>If we take upon us a character above our ca|pacity,
we fall into a twofold inconvenience;&mdash;fir&s;t,
to mi&s;carry in what we have under|taken;
and then to lo&s;e the opportunity of un|dertaking
&s;omewhat el&s;e, more proportionable
to our abilities, in which we might have come
off with honour.</P>
<P>In all the affairs of human life, we &s;hould
take care not to hurt our mind, or offend our
judgment; and this rule, if cautiou&s;ly ob&s;erved
in all our deportment, will be a mighty &s;ecu|rity
to us in all our undertakings, and prevent
us from being injured by folly, or aggreived
by impetuo&s;ity.</P>
<P><PB N="211" REF="225">
At the age of fourteen women begin to be
courted and care&s;&s;ed; then they think that the
recommending them&s;elves to the affections of
the men is the only bu&s;ine&s;s they have to attend
to; and &s;o pre&s;ently fall to tricking&mdash;to dre&s;|&s;ing&mdash;and
practi&s;ing all the little engaging arts
peculiar to their &s;ex: in the&s;e they place all
their hopes, as they do all their happine&s;s in
the &s;ucce&s;s of them:&mdash;But they &s;hould under|&s;tand,
that there are other attractives much
more powerful than the&s;e; that the re&s;pect we
pay them, is not due to their beauty, &s;o much
as to their mode&s;ty, and innocence, and unaf|fected
virtue: and that the&s;e are the true,&mdash;the
irre&s;i&s;tible charms, &s;uch as will make the
&s;ure&s;t and mo&s;t la&s;ting conque&s;ts.</P>
<P>There is no &s;urer &s;ign of &s;tupidity, and want
of &s;en&s;e, than to trifle away a great deal of time
in things relating to the body, as to be long at
exerci&s;e&mdash;or at meals&mdash;or drinking&mdash;or in the
other functions of nature. For we ought to
look upon all that is done to the body as things
by the by, and the improvement of the &s;oul, as
that which challenges our time, and is the true
and main end, and bu&s;ine&s;s of our lives.</P>

We &s;hould never profe&s;s our&s;elves philo&s;o|phers,
