<HEAD>REMARKS on the BILL To Prevent FRAUDS Committed by Bankrupts, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>BEFORE I come to the more immediate Subject of this Book, <HI>viz.</HI> the Bankrupts Bill, it cannot be a|mi&s;s to enter a little into the Hi&s;tory of its Intro|duction, Propo&s;ing, and Pa&s;&s;ing in the Parliament; in which, if I have had any Share, I am very willing to leave the World to cen&s;ure me, as the Effects of this Bill are or are not of general Good to the Trade of <HI>England,</HI> and, in &s;hort, to the whole Nation.</P>
<P>I need not remind the Reader of the unhappy Circum|&s;tances of Trade in general, occa&s;ion'd by a long War, great Lo&s;&s;es at Sea, and a general Stop upon the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Trade.</P>
<P>Nor was our Lo&s;s at Sea &s;ingly occa&s;ion'd by the War, though on that Score Trade had felt &s;everal very &s;evere Shocks, particularly in two <HI>Barbadoes</HI> Fleets, one Ea&s;t Country Fleet, and a Multitude of other Ships which fell into the Enemies Hands; but, as if Heaven had particularly &s;tretcht out its Hand to touch us in the mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible Article, our Trade; has happen'd unu&s;ual Tempe&s;ts which made
<PB N="2" REF="3">
&s;trange Havock among our Shipping; and that more than a|ny former Hi&s;tory can remind us of in &s;o &s;hort a time.</P>
<P>Particularly the Great Storm, on the 27th of <HI>Nov.</HI> 1703. in which an innumerable Number of our Ships peri&s;hed; and the Lo&s;s among the Merchants was incredible.</P>
<P>The very &s;ame time Twelve month, we had &s;o many Storms, tho' le&s;s &s;evere, that Abundance of Ships were ca&s;t away on every Coa&s;t of <HI>England,</HI> but particularly on the North.</P>
<P>In <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> la&s;t Summer, a Tempe&s;t, equally violent as the Great Storm, &s;unk 14 <HI>Barbadoes</HI> Ships, ju&s;t come into <HI>Plymouth</HI> Sound, with all their Loading, and mo&s;t of their Men; and made a dreadful Havock at <HI>Port&s;mouth,</HI> and I&s;le of <HI>Wight.</HI></P>
<P>In <HI>Barbadoes,</HI> a Hurricane de&s;troy'd, I think, Two or Three and Twenty of our Merchants Ships.</P>
<P>The <HI>Jamaica</HI> Fleet felt the Force of it at Sea, and were terribly &s;cattered; &s;ome came &s;tragling home, &s;ome fell into the Enemies Hand, &s;ome peri&s;hed at Sea, and the re&s;t with their Convoy made for <HI>New York,</HI> and <HI>New England,</HI> to repair having &s;uffered extraordinary Damage.</P>
<P>The&s;e, and a Multitude of Circum&s;tances, too many to reckon up here, fell heavy upon Trade, which added to the general Ob&s;truction of the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Trade, and Deadne&s;s of our Manufactures, had among others this mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary Con|&s;equence, that an unu&s;ual Number of Trade&s;-men, as well Merchants as others, &s;unk under the Calamity, and became Bankrupt.</P>
<P>Now, as in former times, the Liberties and Refuges Bank|rupts had found became grievous and &s;candalous to the Na|tion, the Parliament at &s;undry times had made very &s;evere Laws to prevent the Advantages which In&s;olvents took by tho&s;e Retreats to injure and abu&s;e their Creditors.</P>
<P>But when, as before, the Multitude of In&s;olvents increa|&s;ed to &s;uch a Degree, and many hone&s;t Families fell into the
<PB N="3" REF="4">
&s;ame Circum&s;tances, the Severity of the&s;e Laws, de&s;ign'd a|gain&s;t Knaves, fell &s;o &s;everely on the the mi&s;erable and un|fortunate, tho' hone&s;t Traders, that it began to move the Nation to Compa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>The priviledg'd Places being &s;uppre&s;s'd, the Rules of the <HI>Fleet</HI> and <HI>Queen's-Bench</HI> became &s;o throng'd, and the Objects &s;o melancholy, that &s;ome of the cruelle&s;t Creditors began to relent.</P>
<P>The <HI>E&s;cape Act,</HI> as it was call'd, had fill'd the Pri&s;ons with a great Number of Debtors; who being committed without Bail, had no Hopes of ever being delivered, but by the ge|neral Jayl-Delivery of the Grave.</P>
<P>Under this Circum&s;tance Matters &s;tood, when one Mr. <HI>Pit|kin,</HI> a Linnen-Draper, breaking for a very great Sum of Mo|ney, and that with all the dark Circum&s;tances of a de&s;igned Fraud, Application was made to the Parliament by his Cre|ditors for Relief again&s;t this notorious Cheat.</P>
<P>This produc'd the Form of a Bill in general again&s;t Bank|rupts, but the Parliament being ju&s;t coming to a Conclu&s;ion, and the Se&s;&s;ion at an end, there was no time to fini&s;h it as a Law; and &s;o it was given over for that Year.</P>
<P>The Sub&s;tance of this Act was very &s;hort, only to compel the Bankrupt to come in, and &s;urrender him&s;elf, Goods, Books, and Effects to his Creditors; and to a&s;certain the Pe|nalties and Puni&s;hments in Ca&s;e he did not.</P>
<P>Upon the meeting of this pre&s;ent Parliament, this Bill was the fir&s;t thing read in the Hou&s;e, and being committed to a Committee to con&s;ider of it, it lay before them a long time.</P>
<P>'Tis needle&s;s to recite here the Attempts made to put it forward, and by whom: The Bill was all this while a Pro|vi&s;ion only to puni&s;h; but as it &s;eem'd a &s;ufficient Foundati|on to an&s;wer both Debtor and Creditor, &s;everal Per&s;ons on both &s;ides began to con&s;ider how to make it a compleat Act, and both to relieve the mi&s;erable but hone&s;t Debtor already
<PB N="4" REF="5">
fallen into Di&s;a&s;ter, and &s;ecure Trade again&s;t the numerous Mi&s;chiefs of Bankrupts for the future,</P>
<P>And the Bu&s;ine&s;s now before me is, To propo&s;e how this Act may be rendered u&s;eful to the&s;e two happy Ends; and, if po&s;&s;ible, to provide again&s;t and warn us of all the common Abu&s;es of Knaves, which may pervert the End of this, and rob the publick of the Good that is &s;o plainly de|&s;ign'd in it to both Parties.</P>
<P>But a little to per&s;ue the Hi&s;tory of the Bill: It was a great Advantage to the good De&s;ign of making a compleat Act, that there happen'd an Ab&s;urdity in the fir&s;t Contri|vance, which, when it came to be examined into, made it almo&s;t impracticable, as it was; and that was this,</P>
<P>The Act was to compel Bankrupts to &s;urrender them&s;elves and Effects to the Commi&s;&s;ioners. Now the Ca&s;e was thus, When a Commi&s;&s;ion of Bankrupt is taken out again&s;t a Man, the Creditors are at Liberty to come in, or not come in; he that refu&s;es to come in, has indeed no Share of the Bank|rupt's E&s;tate, but is left to get his Debt how he can, and has a Right of Action again&s;t the Debtor as before.&mdash;'Tis true, if he recovers any thing, it &s;hall be recovered again by the Commi&s;&s;ion; but he may lie &s;till, and wait, and fall upon the poor Debtor at la&s;t.</P>
<P>Now to make the Debtor &s;urrender all his Effects to the Commi&s;&s;ion, and yet leave him expos'd to all the Creditors that pleas'd to &s;tand out, was fir&s;t unju&s;t to the Creditor, to &s;hare all among a few, and leave the re&s;t without any thing; and barbarous to the Debtor, to force him to give up his whole E&s;tate to a part of his Creditors, and leave him ex|pos'd to the Mercy of the re&s;t with nothing to pay.</P>
<P>From this Circum&s;tance it &s;eem'd &s;o rational, either to force all the Creditors to come in, or to di&s;charge the Debtor from them that &s;tood out, that when &s;uch an Offer was made to the Hou&s;e, it was too rea&s;onable to be oppo&s;ed; and on the fir&s;t Motion made in the Hou&s;e, it was ordered, <HI>That the</HI>
<PB N="5" REF="6">
<HI>Committee be empower'd to receive a Clau&s;e for the Encourage|ment of &s;uch Bankrupts as &s;hall voluntarily &s;urrender their Effects to the u&s;e of their Creditors.</HI></P>
<P>This was the Birth of the following Law: For now it re|main'd only to con&s;ider, what could encourage the Man to &s;trip him&s;elf naked, and make an hone&s;t Surrender?&mdash;And the An&s;wer was natural, <HI>HIS LIBERTY.</HI> What could you give him that would co&s;t the Creditors le&s;s? What that he could value more? A Thou&s;and Arguments offer'd them&s;elves to u&s;her this into the Bill, and little but mere Tri|fling was urg'd again&s;t it.</P>
<P>It was unan&s;werably argued to the faint Oppo&s;ers of this Bill, That no Man could pay more than all; That to keep a Man in Pri&s;on, when you had &s;tript him naked, was un|chri&s;tian and unrea&s;onable; That to make a Man &s;urrender all he had, and not give him his Liberty, was to &s;tarve him, and put him to Death for Debt, which, however a Crime, was not yet made Fellony by the Law; That to force him to &s;urrender all his Effects, and not give him leave to work for Bread, was to force Men upon Perjuries, and all &s;orts of Ex|tremities, for fear of peri&s;hing; That this would be the way to make more Bankrupts, and Bankrupts more fraudulent; &s;ince De&s;peration would now run them upon all po&s;&s;ible Me|thods to &s;ecure their Effects abroad, and afterwards them|&s;elves, and &s;o Commi&s;&s;ions would be able to reach nothing; That to make Men de&s;perate, was the way to make them Knaves; and as there never was any Law but &s;ome way or other might be evaded or avoided, this would put Mens In|ventions upon the rack for new Methods to defraud their Creditors; That this would farther encrea&s;e the Complaint already made of our Trade&s;-men taking Sanctuary in foreign Countries, and robbing the Nation of its People, &s;ince now not a few only of our Bankrupts, but all Bankrupts mu&s;t go beyond Sea, to avoid a Law, by the Severity of which they mu&s;t be &s;o hardly treated; and a general Depopulation mu&s;t
<PB N="6" REF="7">
in time follow us, as far as extends to all our unfortunate Trade&s;-men; That not our People only, but va&s;t Riches would be thus carried out of the Nation, all our Bankrupts being thus forced to carry their Creditors E&s;tates with them to &s;ub&s;i&s;t them, and enable them to trade and maintain their Families abroad; That this Law was unju&s;t in its Nature, becau&s;e 'twas all Penalty and no Reward, and had a Ten|dency to bring Men to a Nece&s;&s;ity of Puni&s;hment, without any room to avoid it, &s;ince the Man was bound to Mi&s;ery every way; he was to be hang'd if he did not &s;urrender, and &s;tarv'd if he did.</P>
<P>There were Abundance more Arguments u&s;ed of the like Nature, which were never yet an&s;wer'd, and which made the Act appear &s;o Rational, &s;o Nece&s;&s;ary, and &s;o Chri&s;tian, that few People oppos'd it of any Con&s;ideration; and tho&s;e that did were brought to this, that they could not object a|gain&s;t the Bill, only they would not have had it pa&s;s'd till the next Se&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Again&s;t this was urged the pre&s;ent Nece&s;&s;ity of the Bill, the Di&s;a&s;ters of Trade having crowded us with Bankrupts, whom the Cruelty and Ob&s;tinacy of Creditors had driven to &s;uch Extremities, that they liv'd langui&s;hing in Pri&s;ons and priviledg'd Places, where they were forc'd to &s;ub&s;i&s;t, <HI>and at an expen&s;ive Rate too,</HI> upon the E&s;tates of their Creditors, and upon tho&s;e very E&s;tate, which, upon the lea&s;t rea&s;onable Encouragement, they were willing to &s;urrender: That this at la&s;t brought them to have nothing, either for them&s;elves, or Creditors; and then, having no hope of Deliverance, they went abroad, and the Creditors lo&s;t all that they might have had.</P>
<P>And indeed the&s;e things began to be &s;o &s;candalous to the whole Nation, that even the Creditors them&s;elves &s;eem'd ea|ger for this Bill, and, I am forward to &s;ay, will be the great|e&s;t Gainers by it.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="8">
Nothing was more frequent than for a Bankrupt to make a good Offer, perhaps of 5 to 10 and 15s. <HI>per l.</HI> to his Creditors, which all but Two or Three Men would be willing to accept:&mdash;And the&s;e Two or Three Men, either ra&s;hly, and incon&s;ide|rately ob&s;tinate, or having &s;ecret Expectations of more ad|vantageous Offers, or from Malice, Revenge, or a hundred various Cau&s;es, ab&s;olutely reject all Compo&s;ition: Now by the harden'd Cruelty of the&s;e Two or Three, the Man is kept in the Mint or Rules in Mi&s;ery and Di&s;tre&s;s, till in time a Wife and Family and other Circum&s;tances wa&s;te the whole Sum; the re&s;t of the Creditors lo&s;e the Offer they had made them, and the mi&s;erable Man has nothing at all to pay.</P>
<P>I could go on here to publi&s;h, <HI>and did de&s;ign it,</HI> a melancholy Journal of the Barbarities and unheard of Cruelties of Creditors in many particular In&s;tances, which Po&s;terity would hardly be|lieve could be practi&s;ed in this Prote&s;tant Nation, where we pretend to generous Principles, and to practi&s;e Compa&s;&s;ion to the mi&s;erable: I could give a dreadful Li&s;t of the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of Families, who have really peri&s;h'd under the&s;e Barbarities; and who&s;e Mi&s;eries his Heart mu&s;t be harder than mine that can bear to relate.</P>
<P>I choo&s;e therefore to cover them with an univer&s;al Blank, that they may not ri&s;e up in Judgment, even in this World, again&s;t the Honour of the Prote&s;tant Religion, and the gene|ral Character of my Native Country: and &s;ince the Progre&s;s of it is &s;topt, I de&s;ire to have the Particulars forgotten, by which we were labouring in <HI>England,</HI> to recover the Name of the mo&s;t barbarous Nation under the Sun.</P>
<P>Nor &s;hall I record, to their Reproach, the Names and En|deavours of &s;ome Men to loo&s;e a Bill of &s;uch general U&s;eful|ne&s;s to the Nation, from their own Concern in the Cruelties above&s;aid, and for the Sake of private Ca&s;es, where they had &s;ome Debtors under their Hands, who they were loth &s;hould e&s;cape them: I congratulate the poor Men that are thus deli|vered from the Power of unrea&s;onable Creditors; and I con|gratulate
<PB N="8" REF="9">
gratulate tho&s;e Creditors too, in their being re&s;train'd from being &s;o wicked as they would be, and being forc'd to be mo|derate, though again&s;t their Wills.</P>
<P>The&s;e Men indeed made &s;ome Clamours at this Bill, upon the Lords ordering the Merchants to come up, and give their Opinions; but the Arguments were &s;o weak, and the People appear'd &s;o hot, and &s;o vi&s;ibly partial, that the Lords, con|vinc'd by the Rea&s;onablene&s;s and Ju&s;tice of the Bill, agreed to it with &s;ome Amendments; to which Amendments the Commons agreed; and the Bill obtain'd the Royal A&s;&s;ent the 19th of <HI>March,</HI> 1705. The Sub&s;tance of which is as fol|lows.</P>
<P>THE Bill Enacts, That who&s;oever &s;hall become Bankrupt after the <HI>24</HI>th of <HI>June,</HI> and &s;hall not, within thirty Days after Notice given, that a Commi&s;&s;ion of Bankrupt is i&s;&s;ued again&s;t them, &s;urrender them&s;elves to the Commi&s;&s;ion|ers, &amp;c. and &s;ubmit to be examined upon Oath, &amp;c. and conform to all the Statutes already in Force again&s;t Bankrupts, and di&s;cover how, and in what manner, they have di&s;po&s;ed of their E&s;tates, and al&s;o deliver up to the &s;aid Commi&s;&s;ioners all &s;uch Goods, Wares, &amp;c. as at the time of &s;uch Exami|nation is in their Cu&s;tody, &amp;c. wearing Apparel excepted; in Default, or wilful Omi&s;&s;ion thereof, upon lawful Convi|ction, &s;hall &s;uffer as a Felon.</P>
<P>All Per&s;ons who &s;hall &s;urrender and conform as above &s;hall be allowed <HI>5 per Cent.</HI> of the Net Produce of the E&s;tate &s;o &s;urrendred, and &s;hall be fully &s;et free and di&s;charged from all former Debts; and if arre&s;ted afterwards, &s;hall be di&s;|charg'd on common Bail, and may plead in general the Cau&s;e of Action accrued before they became Bankrupt.</P>
<P>The Allowance of <HI>5 per Cent.</HI> &s;hall not exceed <HI>200</HI> l. in the whole, nor be allow'd at all, unle&s;s the Effects amount to <HI>8 s.</HI> in the Pound; but the Commi&s;&s;ioners to be left to Di&s;|cretion what to allow.</P>

Per&s;ons who conceal any of the Bankrupts Effects, or receive any Tru&s;t for them, if within thirty Days after Notice given them, they do not di&s;cover them to the Commi&s;&s;ioners, &s;hall forfeit <HI>100 l.</HI> and double the Value concealed, but if they di&s;cover voluntarily, &s;hall have <HI>3 per Cent.</HI> for all that &s;hall be recovered by &s;uch Di&s;overy.</P>
<P>Commi&s;&s;ioners to have Power to &s;tate open Accompts, and &s;hall accept the Ballance in full Payment.</P>
<P>No Bankrupt that has given above <HI>100 l.</HI> on the Marriage of any of his Children, unle&s;s they can prove upon Oath they were then worth more than the &s;aid <HI>100 l.</HI> all their Debts paid; or that hath lo&s;t in one Day the Value of <HI>5 l.</HI> or in the whole, <HI>100 l.</HI> within a Year, before he became a Bankrupt, at any &s;ort of Game or Play, &s;hall have any Benefit by this Act.</P>
<P>Former Bankrupts, again&s;t whom Commi&s;&s;ions have been i&s;&s;ued before the <HI>10th</HI> of <HI>March,</HI> have Liberty to come in till the <HI>24th</HI> of <HI>June;</HI> and on the &s;ame Terms of Surrender &s;hall have the Benefit of this Act.</P>
<P>No Di&s;covery upon Oath as above &s;hall entitle the Bank|rupt to the Benefit of this Act, unle&s;s the Commi&s;&s;ioners or the major part of them certify to the Lord Chancellor or Keeper, &amp;c. that the &s;aid Bankrupt has conform'd to this Act, and that there doth not appear any Rea&s;on to doubt the &s;aid Oath and Di&s;covery; and unle&s;s the &s;aid Certificate &s;hall be confirm'd by the &s;aid Lord Chancellor or Keeper, &amp;c. or Two of the Judges, to whom &s;uch Certificate &s;hall be referr'd, and the Creditors to be heard if they de&s;ire.</P>
<P>No Expence to be allowed to the Commi&s;&s;ioners for Eat|ing and Drinking; and if any Commi&s;&s;ioner &s;hall order any &s;uch Expence to be made, &amp;c. to be for ever di&s;abled to act as a Commi&s;&s;ioner.</P>
<P><PB REF="11">
I confe&s;s I cannot but wonder why the Gentlemen that oppos'd this Law, <HI>&s;o univer&s;ally de&s;ir'd,</HI> &s;hould be &s;o eager again&s;t it.&mdash;I am loth to &s;ugge&s;t <HI>what &s;ome for want of Charity are of the Opinion is too true</HI> that the&s;e Men, whether Drapers or others, taking large Credit them&s;elves are loth to be depriv'd of the Opportunity when they &s;hall find Occa&s;ion to break to their Advantage: I won't affirm, that the&s;e Gentlemen having al|ways practi&s;ed the &s;candalous Method of &s;tanding out in Compo&s;itions, to get collateral, clande&s;tine Securities, are loth to venture &s;tanding upon even hand with other Men in Ca&s;es of Bankrupts;&mdash;Nor will I &s;ay they frequently &s;et up young Men without Stocks, give them large Credits at fir&s;t; under the Shadow of which Sham Beginnings they get into other Mens Debt, and pay the&s;e off with their Neigh|bours E&s;tates: I won't &s;ay they all do, as one of them own'd to me he did, <HI>viz.</HI> &s;tretch the Law to get a Man out of his Hou&s;e, and then &s;wear him a Bankrupt, though he never had committed the lea&s;t Act of Bankrupcy, but what they forc'd him to.</P>
<P><HI>I won't &s;ay,</HI> (tho' I doubt 'tis too true) that they have by Cruelties and Oppre&s;&s;ions, got already &s;eperate Payments and private Con&s;iderations from Bankrupts, under their Power, and made them purcha&s;e their Favour at the Price of abu&s;ing the re&s;t of their Creditors, which &s;eparate Sums <HI>mu&s;t now be refunded,</HI> and the Knavery of it appear.</P>
<P><HI>But this I will &s;ay,</HI> that unle&s;s the&s;e or &s;uch as the&s;e are the Rea&s;ons, 'tis a perfect My&s;tery to the World, why the&s;e Gentlemen, or any Man of Trade in <HI>England,</HI> &s;hould be a|gain&s;t this Bill; and I wonder they have not attempted to &s;how &s;ome better Rea&s;ons for it.</P>
<P>And this I mu&s;t &s;ay, That this Act &s;ets all Creditors on an equal foot with one another; and takes away all the Advan|tages ob&s;tinate de&s;igning Knaves had over hone&s;t Men: Cre|ditors will now fare all alike; they will go Hand in Hand to make the be&s;t of the Bankrupt's E&s;tate, and all have their Share in it.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="12">
I &s;hall now enter a little into the probable Advantages of this Bill to the Publick, as well as in particular to both Creditor and Debtor; and then de&s;cend to the Methods proper to be taken on both Sides, in the Pur&s;uit of this Act, to make it u&s;eful to the Publick: And, I doubt not, before I have done, the Gentlemen who &s;eem'd to be again&s;t this Act will be ve|ry glad it has pa&s;s'd, and very &s;en&s;ible with how much mi|&s;taken Zeal they oppos'd their own Benefit.</P>
<P>I &s;hall not in the Advantages of this Bill in&s;i&s;t much upon the Debtor's Part; 'tis plain, his Advantage con&s;i&s;ts in ob|taining his Liberty, to try his Fortune again in&punc; the World, and go to work for Bread, that he may &s;upport his Family, and live.&mdash;If he has a more than common Stock of Princi|ple, he has room given him, if ever God in his Providence tru&s;ts him again with an E&s;tate, he has an Opportunity put in his Hand to recover the Reputation of his Integrity, which having &s;uffered &s;ome Scandal, he may re&s;tore by a gratui|tous Payment of tho&s;e Creditors, from whom he has been legally di&s;charged. And I cannot quit this Head, without earne&s;tly moving &s;uch Men to remember, that the Obligation of Con&s;cience mu&s;t remain as far as with corre&s;ponding Cir|cum&s;tances they can rea&s;onably an&s;wer things, be&s;ides a Debt of Gratitude to &s;uch Creditors in particular, who being kind, tender, and forward to comply with rea&s;onable Offers, have been untainted with the Cruelties that have helpt to ruin and de&s;troy the Nation.</P>
<P>Again the Vici&s;&s;itude of Fortunes mu&s;t weigh with tho&s;e Gentlemen, that have left in them any thing of a Sen&s;e of humane Mi&s;ery; you Gentlemen that being delivered by this Act from the Cruelty and Fury of your Creditors.&mdash;Per|haps &s;ome of you may live to &s;ee tho&s;e very Creditors reduc'd and Bankrupt, when you are free again, and flouri&s;hing.</P>
<P>Remember then the Condition you are in now, remember who &s;ets up, and who pulls down, and double the Genero&s;ity of your Principle, by the timeing your Hone&s;ty to their Ne|ce&s;&s;ity;
<PB N="$$" REF="13">
let your Compa&s;&s;ion to their Misfortunes te&s;tify how well you merited Compa&s;&s;ion in your own; and never reflect on their ill Treatment of you, if they are of the Number of your pre&s;ent Oppo&s;ers, but heap Coles of Fire upon their Heads, by letting them &s;ee your Sence of Honour and Con|&s;cience has an ab&s;olute Dominion over your Pa&s;&s;ions and Re|&s;entments; that you are Gentlemen enough to forget Inju|ries, and Chri&s;tians enough to relieve your Enemies.</P>
<P>Perhaps &s;ome may think this Labour lo&s;t, but I cannot ask Pardon for the Digre&s;&s;ion; if it moves but one Man in Ten Thou&s;and to act the generous and hone&s;t part, I am &s;atisfy'd, and &s;hall not think I have labour'd in vain.</P>
<P>But I mu&s;t own, after all, the Advantages of this Bill &s;eem to be va&s;tly great and exten&s;ive, beyond what I can touch at; on the part of the Creditor, on the part of Trade in general, and on the part of the whole Nation.</P>
<P>The Effect it has on the pre&s;ent Di&s;tre&s;&s;es of Bankrupts al|ready in&s;olvent, which &s;ome merciful Men, Thanks be to their Ignorance, would have had omitted, are indeed con&s;i|derable; and made &s;o at this time by the unu&s;ual Multitude of &s;uch unhappy Ca&s;es, which now lie upon the Nation.</P>
<P>But the&s;e are Trifles to what's to come, and though I am very glad to &s;ee the Generality of the Trading part of the People are &s;en&s;ible of it; yet I cannot but a little enter into the Particulars of it, for the Sake of tho&s;e who pretend to pro|fe&s;s &s;ome Ignorance upon that Account.</P>
<P>1&s;t. I think I may affirm, we &s;hall not have &s;o many Bank|rupts as we had before, no not by a very great Number; and this I make plain from the&s;e Con&s;equences.</P>
<P N="1">1. That the E&s;tates of Bankrupts being immediately &s;ur|rendred, and fairly divided among the Creditors, the Fall of one Man will not have the &s;ame fatal Effect upon others, as it formerly had, when they lo&s;t Stock and Block; and when Dividends being po&s;tpon'd, and by the Knavery of Commi&s;|&s;ioners, perhaps wholly &s;unk, the Creditor has not been able to wait, but &s;inks under the Lo&s;s.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="13" REF="14">
2. Ob&s;&s;inate Creditors can no longer make willing Cre|ditors loo&s;e their E&s;tates, and force the Debtor to live upon the Stock that &s;hould be divided among them; by which means Lo&s;&s;es will not fall &s;o heavy upon the Sufferer, which now is too often the Ruin of the Creditor as well as Debtor, and makes one follow the other to the End of the Chapter. But now all the va&s;t Sums &s;quander'd away in the Mint, Rules, Pri&s;ons, Commi&s;&s;ions of Bankrupt, in Suits at Law, bribing of Officers, and Pri&s;on-keepers, and the like will be hone&s;tly &s;har'd among the Creditors, to help &s;upport them under the Lo&s;s, which of it &s;elf is often times Load enough, not to need the Addition of &s;uch de&s;tructive Articles.</P>
<P N="3">3. The fraudulent Bankrupt has his way hedg'd up; he will now find it &s;o difficult to break thro' the Bars and Bolts of the Law, that where Ten ventur'd before to rob their Creditors, and contrive a Rupture, it is probable, and I hope rational to believe, &s;carce one will do it now; &s;ince whoever he is that will attempt to break by De&s;ign, has but two Doors open for him, <HI>viz.</HI> Perjury or Bani&s;hment. Now tho' there may be found a Villain &s;o harden'd, &s;uch an Incendiary in Trade, that to ama&s;s an E&s;tate will venture upon God and Man, and neither values Bani&s;hment out of the Kingdom of <HI>England,</HI> no nor out of the Kingdom of Heaven; that will for&s;wear him&s;elf to &s;tay, or purcha&s;e the Brand of Infamy, and be gone; yet all Men will allow, &s;uch Difficulties, &s;uch Hazards, and &s;uch Con&s;equences attend both, that Men will not be &s;o forward to venture.</P>
<P>He that will fly and abandon his Country and Friends, in|deed has the &s;afe&s;t Part, and may go, and even that way the Nation is well rid of him, and he can never come home a|gain: He is bani&s;h'd for Life with that infamous Title of a common Thief; and if ever, <HI>Pitkin</HI> like, he &s;hould be reco|vered and brought back by Force, he goes directly to the Gallows, as he de&s;erves.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="15">
He that will &s;tay at home, mortgages Soul and Body to make a Re&s;erve, if he has any &s;eparate Hopes, he mu&s;t &s;wear as thro' a 10 Inch Plank: At the &s;ame time he is hedg'd about with Dangers; and if he has not laid his Matters very nicely together, if either for good Will or ill Will it &s;hould ever come out, he is gone, and he dyes without Benefit of Clergy: If it never comes out, he lives in a con&s;tant Dread of it, is a Slave to every one he has tru&s;ted; and be&s;ides the Trifle of the Perjury, and little regarded Terror of &s;omething here|after, which &s;ometime or other may come upon him hand in hand with Death, there is a &s;ettled Unea&s;ine&s;s lea&s;t &s;ometime or other he &s;hall be betrayed even by him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Will any Man doubt whether fewer Men will venture than did before. 'Tis plain, Gentlemen, now, there will be nothing to be got by breaking, but what will be had at &s;uch a Price, that the Purcha&s;e is not worth the Repentance: No Man in his Wits will venture; he mu&s;t be compleatly a Vil|lain that will go, and he mu&s;t have Walls of Bra&s;s about his Heart, and be fenc'd again&s;t all &s;orts of common Terrors, that dare &s;tay here; That can look Ju&s;tice and his Creditors in the Face with a Lye, and keep a &s;teady Countenance with a Load of intollerable Guilt.</P>
<P>That perhaps &s;ome &s;uch Men may be found is not un|likely, but that equal Numbers of them to what were before &s;hould be &s;een, is highly improbable; and were there no other Advantage to Trade from this Bill, than the le&s;&s;ening the Numbers of Bankrupts, it is an Article worth all the re&s;t.</P>
<P N="2">2. In the next Place, there will be fewer Commi&s;&s;ions of Bankrupt i&s;&s;ued than u&s;ual; and, if I may gue&s;s right, I am of the Opinion not One to Five.</P>
<P>When Creditors know, that the Debtor, upon delivering his Effects upon Oath, &s;hall obtain his Liberty, to what pur|po&s;e &s;hould they take out a Commi&s;&s;ion? If the Debtor offers his Effects, and a voluntary Oath, and they &s;ee Rea&s;on to be|lieve him &s;incere, what Occa&s;ion is there of the Commi&s;&s;i|oners?</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="16">
When the Debtor knows, that upon a Commi&s;&s;ions being taken out, he mu&s;t come in, and &s;urrender, upon Pain of Death, to what purpo&s;e &s;hould he decline making an Oath, and hone&s;tly coming in at fir&s;t?</P>
<P>At the Beginning of a Di&s;a&s;ter, when a Trade&s;-man falls, he is generally tender, willing to be fair, open, and for|ward to make a free Offer; Retreats and Time, put Men up|on Shiftings and Subterfuges, Mints, Rules, and the Society there, harden them in their Circum&s;tances: This Act takes them into its Protection at fir&s;t, upon &s;tated Terms ea&s;y for the Creditor, and &s;afe for the Debtor, and &s;ecures him from fal|ling into Hands that may debauch his Principles, and prompt him to more Evil than he under&s;tood before: And, I believe, no body will di&s;pute with me this Propo&s;ition, That were all Debtors complyed with in the fir&s;t Offers to their Creditors, the Creditors would have been Gainers, and the Morals of the Debtors have been better pre&s;erv'd.</P>
<P>If then the Man in his fir&s;t Sorrows is clos'd with his all, hone&s;tly tender'd, as frankly accepted, while the Man is &s;in|cere, and willing to be hone&s;t, all Men will allow there will be no need of Commi&s;&s;ions; the Charges, Dilemma's, and long Croud of Inconveniencies that attend Statutes, will be &s;av'd, and even this way this Act will be a publick Benefit to Trade.</P>
<P>This Bill is a kind of Truce between Debtor and Creditor; the Debtor is fallen into Decay, and coming to his Creditor, as his injur'd Friend, tells him, how willing he is to make him Satisfaction to the utmo&s;t of his Capacity, and to give up all he has in the World to that End; and the Creditor by this Act is oblig'd to accept it: The Creditor comes to the Debtor, and tells him, <Q>&startq;&endq;You have taken my Goods, and now you are not able to make me Satisfaction, pray be &s;o ju&s;t to me to make Satisfaction as far as you can, and give me up what you have,</Q> for 'tis all mine; and by this Act he is bound to comply with him: And both the&s;e are con&s;o|nant

<P>The Cries of oppre&s;s'd Families, &s;tarving by the inexorable Cruelty of mercile&s;s Creditors, will be heard no more among us; Debtors will be no more made de&s;perate by the Credi|tors refu&s;ing the &s;incere&s;t Offers, and Families obliged to live and &s;pend the Stocks of their Creditors.</P>
<P>Above all the Grievances, both real and pretended, of Mint, Rules, Pri&s;oners at large, Protections, and all the long roll of Law Shams, equally mi&s;chievous both to Debtor and Creditor, will now be entirely &s;unk of Cour&s;e: The Keepers of the Pri&s;ons Warden, Mar&s;hal, &amp;c. will have no Men in their Hands, <HI>at lea&s;t upon the Article of Trade,</HI> that either can ask them any Favour, or to whom they can give any Protection. Thirty Days the Mint may skreen a Bankrupt, bu$ after that he &s;hall be demanded as a Felon, and be fetch'd even from the Horns of the Altar.</P>
<P>Pity and Compa&s;&s;ion will now cea&s;e to be a Debt to Men in Misfortune, for who would be mov'd with the Mi&s;eries of tho&s;e, who, if they will be hone&s;t, may be &s;afe and re|fu&s;e it.</P>
<P>Here will be no Shelterers in the&s;e Sanctuaries above the Law, this Act, with no other Coercive than that of Mens own Intere&s;t, will bring Men back; the true Sanctuary of an hone&s;t Man will be in the Arms of the Law: In&s;tead of flying from the Law for fear of Puni&s;hment, he now will fly to the Law for Protection; in&s;tead of ab&s;conding and hiding him&s;elf from his Creditors, now he will run to &s;eek them out, offer them all he has as their Due, and demand his Liberty as his Right, which they have no Power to abridge him of, or deny him.</P>

It remains now to attempt two things; fir&s;t, to antici|pate tho&s;e People, who, by the Craft and Subtilty of the times, always furni&s;h them&s;elves with Methods to evade the Laws.</P>
<P N="2">2. To direct Men who hone&s;tly de&s;ign to do what this Law obliges them to, in order both to the Satisfaction of their Creditors, and their own Liberty.</P>
<P>As to evading this Law, I mu&s;t &s;ay this to it, that I be|lieve no Law has been lately made le&s;s &s;ubject to the Chicane and Artifice of Men of Cunning than this; though it is not without its weak part neither: I &s;hall endeavour to examine it &s;trictly.</P>
<P>1&s;t. This I pretend to affirm for the Satisfaction of the ob|jecting Creditor, there is not one Flaw, not one loo&s;e Place, not one Inch of Room for the Debtor to creep out by, on your Side; if he is once a Bankrupt, you have him fa&s;t, he mu&s;t &s;urrender him&s;elf, Books, Goods, and Effects, and &s;wear they are all he has, you have left him nothing but the Cloths on his Back, not a Bed to lie on, not a Knife to cut his Bread with, nor a Penny to buy him any; and if he fails in the lea&s;t Point, he lies at your Mercy for his Life.</P>
<P>I know 'tis objected, that the Felony part will never be put in Execution.&mdash;I would advi&s;e no Debtor to run the Ri&s;que, e&s;pecially if any of tho&s;e Gentlemen happen to be their Cre|ditors, who have &s;o vigorou&s;ly appear'd again&s;t this Bill: I cannot que&s;tion, but that Creditor, that by an E&s;cape War|rant would put his Debtor in Pri&s;on for Life, would al&s;o take away his Life, if the Law furni&s;h'd him with Power to do it.</P>
<P>If there is any weak Part in this Law, 'tis I think on the Debtor's &s;ide.</P>
<P N="1">1. When a Man breaks, and has &s;urrendred all he has in the World, it &s;eems to leave him at the Mercy of the Commi&s;&s;ioners, whether they will believe his Oath, and whether they will certify for him to my Lord Keeper, or no.</P>
<P><PB N="$$" REF="19">
I confe&s;s, I pre&s;s'd hard in Parliament for an Amendment to this Part, and was for adding the&s;e Words, <Q>&startq;&endq;<HI>Which Cer|tificate the &s;aid Commi&s;&s;ioners are hereby requir'd to make in ..... Days after the &s;aid Oath,</HI></Q> <HI>or to &s;hew Cau&s;e,</HI> &amp;c. Which Amendment was &s;o rea&s;onable, that I doubt not it would have been agreed to by both Hou&s;es, had there been Time for it.</P>
<P>But I would have no Man di&s;courag'd for want of this Clau&s;e, for the Nature of the thing, and the true De&s;ign of the Clau&s;e join together to &s;hew the Commi&s;&s;ioners their Duty in this Ca&s;e; and as the Commi&s;&s;ioners of Bankrupt are but the Lord Keeper's Servants and Deputies, he is their Judge; and it &s;hall not be &s;ufficient to a Commi&s;&s;ioner to &s;ay to the Bankrupt, I will not certify that I do believe you, or I will not believe you, but he &s;hall certify that he does, or does not, and upon his Refu&s;al, my Lord Keeper is too ju&s;t not to oblige him to it.</P>
<P>And the Words of the Act explain this, which does not &s;ay, Unle&s;s the Commi&s;&s;ioner &s;hall certify that he does not doubt, but unle&s;s he &s;hall certify that he <HI>has no Rea&s;on to doubt;</HI> &s;o that the Liberty of the Bankrupt do$$ not depend upon his <HI>will</HI> or <HI>will not,</HI> but upon the Rea&s;on he has for it; of which Rea&s;on I pre&s;ume no Commi&s;&s;ioner will pretend to &s;ay my Lord Keeper is not the Judge.</P>
<P>The Commi&s;&s;ioner then is to certify, or he is not; if he certifies to the Relea&s;e of the Debtor yet it is not deci&s;ive, for my Lord Keeper mu&s;t confirm it, and the Creditor &s;hall be heard; what is this but making my Lord Keeper judge of the Commi&s;&s;ioners Certificate, in behalf of the Creditor? <HI>On the oth$r Hand,</HI> he certify in the Negative, &s;hall not the Lord Keeper be Judge of his Rea&s;ons, and the Debtor be heard, this would not be con&s;onant to Rea&s;on or Ju&s;tice at all.</P>
<P>Again, if the Lord Keeper &s;hall be Judge what he &s;hall certify, &s;hall he not be Judge whether he ought to certify at all or no?&mdash;Our Laws are grounded
<PB REF="20">
upon Rea&s;on; and this would be to act contrary to Rea&s;on, and con&s;equently again&s;t the Sen&s;e, Intent, and Mean|ing of the Act it &s;elf, and no Debtor need fear Relief again&s;t &s;uch an Oppre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>My Lord Chancellor, Lord Keeper, &amp;c. has the ab&s;olute Power of naming the Commi&s;&s;ioners to every Statute; he that &s;hould offer &s;uch an apparent Partiality, and refu&s;e ar|bitrarily to certify to a Debtor's Di&s;charge, or his Rea&s;ons a|gain&s;t it, mu&s;t have very mean Thoughts of my Lord Keeper's Ju&s;tice, if ever he expected to be tru&s;ted in a Com|mi&s;&s;ion again, and have the Liberty of a Debtor, or the E|&s;tates of Creditors committed to him.</P>
<P>Nor can the Commi&s;&s;ioners teaz the Debtor with that u&s;ual ruinous Cavil of the Creditors, we are not &s;atisfied, and you mu&s;t make a farther Di&s;covery, we believe this is not all; for here the Surrender and Oath is actually fini&s;h'd, before the Certificate can be demanded: The Di&s;covery is per|fect, or it is not; if it is not perfect, the Commi&s;&s;ions know it, or they do not; if they know it, the matter of a Certifi|cate is at an end, the Man mu&s;t be indicted for Perjury, and die as a Felon; if they do not know it, yet they mu&s;t certify.</P>
<P>But they may have Grounds to &s;u&s;pect; the&s;e Su&s;picions then mu&s;t be Legal Su&s;picions or Moral.&mdash;A Legal Su&s;picion I do not under&s;tand, and cannot think any thing can rai&s;e ju&s;tifi|able Doubts in this Ca&s;e, but a moral A&s;&s;urance, deficient on|ly in Form and literal Points; and of all the&s;e, my Lord Keeper &s;hall without que&s;tion be Judge.</P>
<P>Again, &s;hould Commi&s;&s;ioners refu&s;e or delay their Certifi|cates in &s;uch Ca&s;es as the&s;e, it would quite invert the De&s;ign of this Act, which really is, to have Bankrupts &s;urrender their Effects; and if once the Commi&s;&s;ioners render the Deb|tor's Liberty precarious, we &s;hall run back into wor&s;e Di&s;a|&s;ters than we were in before: Debtors will all fly from the Terror of the fir&s;t part of the Act, being not &s;ecur'd of the Mercy of the &s;econd.</P>
<P><PB REF="21">
This would be, <HI>indeed,</HI> to make it a Law, <HI>To bani&s;h Bank|rupts, and their Effects, beyond Sea,</HI> and not a Law to prevent their Frauds.</P>
<P>The&s;e Rea&s;ons, I hope, will be &s;ufficient to move the Bank|rupt to &s;urrender without Fear, and to let the Commi&s;&s;ioners know, that to refu&s;e them Ju&s;tice in this Ca&s;e, will be but a vain Attempt to &s;erve private Intere&s;ts, and ruin the De&s;ign of the Act, in which perhaps they may find them&s;elves over|rul'd by the Lord Keeper, and u&s;ed as they de&s;erve.</P>
<P>I had &s;ome Thoughts here, to have an&s;wered the weak fooli&s;h Objections again&s;t this Act.</P>
<P>As that People will break the fa&s;ter for it; that they will run on to the la&s;t Ga&s;p, and being &s;ure upon what foot they &s;hall be accepted and di&s;charg'd, will &s;tand as long as they can; that when broke in any tolerable Circum&s;tances, they were always well treated before, and the like.</P>
<P>That any Man will beeak <HI>for the Sake of beginning again with</HI> 5 per Cent. is too ab&s;urd to need an An&s;wer; that Men will be encourag'd to run <HI>to the la&s;t,</HI> is ju&s;t arguing again&s;t Fact; 'tis plain, this Act takes all po&s;&s;ible Care to encourage them to &s;urrender <HI>in time,</HI> by an Encouragement of 5 <HI>per Cent. and none,</HI> if they do not pay 8 <HI>s.</HI> per <HI>l.</HI> 'Tis as plain, Men held out to the la&s;t Ga&s;p before, by the Terrors <HI>of ill &V;&s;age</HI> they expected if they fell. As to Peoples being always kind, when Debtors offer high, there are &s;uch innumerable In&s;tan|ces of the contrary that I refer them to Practice, particularly of a late Citizen and Draper, who peri&s;h'd in Jail, and, as &s;ome &s;ay, of meer want, under the Severity of a Statute, when one Ship brought home Effects for him but a few Days after his Death, which, added to what they had before, was &s;ufficient to pay all his Debts, and 5 <HI>s.</HI> per <HI>l.</HI> over; and yet they were &s;o far from Compa&s;&s;ion to him, that they would neither &s;upply him with Food, or Phy&s;ick, but let him dye under <HI>their Commi&s;&s;ion Mercy.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="22">
I could give innumerable In&s;tances of the like Trade Le|nity, &s;ufficient to warn Debtors from throwing them&s;elves upon the Mercy of their Creditors; but 'tis too obvious to want any &s;uch Illu&s;tration.</P>
<P>The remaining Que&s;tion is, What mu&s;t the Debtor do now, to obtain the Ju&s;tice of this Law at the Hands of his Cre|ditors?</P>
<P>The An&s;wer to this is &s;hort and direct.</P>
<P>1&s;t. Be very plain, genuine, and &s;incere on your part, and, making no Re&s;erves or He&s;itations, give &s;uch evident Demon|&s;trations of an untainted Integrity, that no Creditor or Com|mi&s;&s;ioner, without blu&s;hing, can have the lea&s;t Jealou&s;y, or the lea&s;t Shadow of Su&s;picion, that the wor&s;t Enemy cannot have the Face to deny you the Certificate. <HI>There is &s;omething in Truth,</HI> &s;omething in <HI>Native Hone&s;ty</HI> &s;o ju&s;t, &s;o genuine, &s;o natural, and &s;o free, that even Malice it &s;elf &s;ubmits to the Power of it, and Envy is a&s;ham'd to appear again&s;t it.</P>
<P N="2">2. If &s;uch a Behaviour gives you no Advantage with mer|cenary brib'd Commi&s;&s;ioners, and it &s;hould be your Misfor|tune to meet with &s;uch, depend upon it, it will &s;tand your Friend with my Lord Keeper; <HI>the Power of Truth</HI> will pre|vail there, and Hone&s;ty will be too con&s;picuous not to be di&s;|cern'd by a Judge &s;o impartial, and &s;o penetrating as his Lord|&s;hip is allow'd to be, by Men of all Parties.</P>
<P>I know, 'tis recommended by &s;ome People to fly to poli|tick Methods, and make, as they call it, &s;ure Work with them; the&s;e are &s;uch as follow.</P>
<P N="1">1. To tho&s;e who are already Bankrupt, and who are left to their Liberty, whether they will come in or no; that they &s;hould &s;tate to the Creditors what they are able to &s;urrender, and capitulate with them to con&s;ent to their Di&s;charge, or not agree to the Surrender.</P>
<P N="2">2. To tho&s;e hereafter who are oblig'd to come in upon Pain of Death, to &s;ecure all their Effects po&s;&s;ible at the fir&s;t Rupture, and then make Conditions with the Commi&s;&s;ioners
<PB N="22" REF="23">
and Creditors, during the Thirty Days, which Conditions if they will accept, they are di&s;charg'd of cour&s;e; if not, they have Thirty Days to prepare to be gone in.</P>
<P>As to the&s;e things, I confe&s;s, if Commi&s;&s;ioners and Credi|tors appear refractory and &s;crupulous, and refu&s;e Men their Liberty after fair Surrenders, it will drive People to &s;uch things, and more that I could mention; and 'tis a good Cau|tion to Commi&s;&s;ioners and Creditors, not to trapan their Deb|tors into Surrenders, and then trick them into Pri&s;ons, and refu&s;e their Di&s;charges; and for this end I name the&s;e things.</P>
<P>But that which clears up the thing to me, is, To what End &s;hould the Creditors or Commi&s;&s;ioners deny the Man his Di&s;charge?&mdash;If by delaying it, they could hope for farther Di&s;covery, there was &s;omething to be &s;aid for it; but the Debtor is foreclo&s;ed in that by his Oath, and the Penalty of Felony on an imperfect Surrender.</P>
<P>If they can di&s;cover any thing he has re&s;erv'd, though af|ter the Di&s;charge, he forfeits the Liberty they gave him, and his Life too. To what purpo&s;e then can they deny the Cer|tificate? It mu&s;t be meer naked Malice, and ungrounded Prejudice; and I believe mo&s;t Commi&s;&s;ioners will be not ve|ry forward to &s;how them&s;elves to my Lord Keeper in that, or to run the Ri&s;que of his Lord&s;hip's Cen&s;ure.</P>
<P>They cannot put him off here with the Sugge&s;tion, that they do not believe him, and that he mu&s;t think of a far|ther Di&s;covery; for a farther Di&s;covery is his De&s;truction, and lies upon them to find out, and detect him in, not for him to di&s;cover.</P>
<P>I cannot omit to examine here what may entitle the Bank|rupt to the Honour of the Penalty of this Act, I mean the Gallows: And I think 'tis nece&s;&s;ary to hint it, as well to warn him what will condemn him, that he may avoid it, as to prevent needle&s;s Terrors upon well meaning Men, and the needle&s;s Awe which &s;ome Creditors, I under&s;tand already, think to fix upon their Debtors, to fright them from taking the Benefit of this Act.</P>

<P>I do not wonder therefore to hear Men exclaim again&s;t this Act, who have got large Shares of the E&s;tates of their Debtors in their Hands; and who by Cunning, by Force, and a hundred Pretences, have made private Bargains with Debtors, who &s;ign Compo&s;itions for a Colour, and to draw other Men in, but get private Bonds, collateral Securities, and the like, from the poor Debtor, to bring them to that Compliance. This Act will be a Day of Judgment to &s;uch Peo|ple, and hone&s;t Men will now &s;ee who rob'd them. The&s;e Men I take to be wor&s;e Cheats than the Bankrupt, becau&s;e they drive a Man into a Crime, by &s;uch a Force which they know the Nece&s;&s;ity of his Affairs will not &s;uffer him to re&s;i&s;t. They are Thieves of other Mens E&s;tates; for though they &s;eek but
<PB N="24" REF="25">
a ju&s;t Debt, and that is their Excu&s;e; yet they prompt the poor Man to pay them, what they know is none of his own.</P>
<P>The Debtor, 'tis true, is equally in Debt to every Credi|tor &s;eparately, and ought to pay them the whole; but after a Fraction, and he is unable to di&s;charge the particular Obli|gation, he becomes then oblig'd to them all as a Body, and in Hone&s;ty mu&s;t not pay one more in Proportion than ano|ther; he that does is not hone&s;t, and he that prompts him to do it to obtain any Relaxation, or Abatement of Pro&s;ecution, is a wor&s;e Knave than he; that Creditor that takes it wilfully, and in &s;uch a manner, is an acce&s;&s;ary to one of the wor&s;t of Cheats.&mdash;And let him be who he will, he is a De&s;troyer of other Mens Property, and a Robber of his Neighbour.</P>
<P>That this Act will make Abundance of &s;uch Frauds as the&s;e publick, I make no doubt; and that the guilty mu&s;t refund, I believe they do not doubt; and I que&s;tion not, but this is the principal Rea&s;on, why &s;ome People fly out again&s;t the Act, and again&s;t me for my Share in it:&mdash;And let them rail, their Guilt makes them angry, but hone&s;t Men will &s;hare in the Re&s;titution they mu&s;t make, and that's my Sa|tisfaction: I take them all to be politick Thieves, and rejoice to &s;ee them come off &s;o well, and not fare like Thieves of le&s;s Guilt, that die only becau&s;e they have the Misfortune to come within the Letter of the Law.</P>
<P>Let no Bankrupt therefore blu&s;h to own, what cruel Cre|ditors have lain hard upon them to do, whom they have made wrong their other Creditors, to give them private Satisfaction. This Law is made not to puni&s;h you for the Concealment, but them for the Encroachment, and to bring them to Re|&s;titution, that hone&s;t Creditors may &s;tand upon the &s;ame foot with them; and Compo&s;itions make a better Show than they u&s;ed to do.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="26">
And I cannot omit here, what I purpo&s;ely re&s;erv'd to this Place, that this Act will produce this Benefit to Trade among the re&s;t, that mo&s;t Bankrupts will make better Compo&s;itions than before; and there are Abundance of Rea&s;ons to be given for it;
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. The tedious Expences of &s;ecuring, and coming at the Effects will be &s;hortned.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. The Ea&s;ine&s;s of Concealments will be &s;traightned, and the Occa&s;ion of them in part removed.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. Clande&s;tine, collateral, and &s;eperate Agreements with Creditors, and partial, private Payments be effectual|ly de&s;troyed.</ITEM>
</LIST>
All which will contribute to pre&s;erve the E&s;tate of the Bank|rupt, and con&s;equently make the Dividend the larger.</P>
<P>That the Divi&s;ion of the Bankrupt's E&s;tate will be &s;ooner, is a thing I need not &s;pend time about, becau&s;e 'tis apparent it mu&s;t come &s;ooner into the Hands of the Commi&s;&s;ioners; and the Bankrupt will be always a&s;&s;i&s;tant to the collecting and recovering it, which, as it has been, cannot often be had.</P>
<P>But to return to the Danger of the Debtor in his &s;urrender|ing his Effects to his Creditor.</P>
<P>Every forgotten Debt, which may be really owing to the Bankrupt, and which in his Accompt he may not have given in, will not expo&s;e him to the Penalty of this Act: 'Tis true, if after &s;uch Surrender, the Bankrupt &s;hould go about to re|ceive the Money, and apply it to his private U&s;e, or &s;hould be put in mind of &s;uch a Debt owing to him, and &s;hould not immediately di&s;cover it, he would in either of tho&s;e Ca&s;es in|cur the Penalty, and de&s;ervedly &s;uffer it.</P>
<P>I would there&s;ore, <HI>in this Ca&s;e,</HI> to avoid the Cen&s;ure and Mi&s;con&s;tructions of Mankind, and to remove the Opportu|nity and Advantages any Man <HI>might make</HI> of other's Infirmi|ty;
<PB N="26" REF="27">
I would, <HI>I &s;ay,</HI> recommend to every Bankrupt, that comes in, and claimes the Benefit of this Act, under the Account of his Affairs, which he gives, <HI>and before his Oath,</HI> to &s;ub&s;cribe &s;ome &s;hort Provi&s;o like this:</P>
<P><Q>&startq;&endq;I <HI>A. B.</HI> do farther declare, That if there be <HI>any Er|ror</HI> in the &s;aid Accounts, or if any Debt due, or to grow due to me from any Per&s;on, <HI>not incerted</HI> in this Account, or any Goods or Effects of mine remaining in any Per&s;ons Hands, not mentioned and di&s;covered <HI>in this &s;aid Account;</HI> it is not <HI>wilfully</HI> made, <HI>omitted,</HI> or <HI>conceal</HI>'d, and &s;hall be faithfully di&s;cover'd, <HI>recti|fy'd,</HI> and <HI>&s;urrender'd,</HI> as &s;oon as it &s;hall occur to my Knowledge and Remembrance.</Q></P>
<P>I am not in&s;en&s;ible, that Men who&s;e Affairs are declining, are not always <HI>the exacte&s;t People</HI> in their Books: 'Tis a me|lancholy thing to be always ballancing <HI>Accompts of Lo&s;s;</HI> there is &s;omething unplea&s;ant in the very A&s;pect of things, when <HI>all goes to rack;</HI> Omi&s;&s;ions, Mi&s;takes, and forgotten Articles are never &s;o frequent, as when Men, knowing they are <HI>playing a lo&s;ing Game,</HI> grow de&s;perate, and care not which way things go; and in the&s;e Hurries it may happen, that an hone&s;t well-meaning Man may forget both a Debt or a Credit; <HI>a great many</HI> little Clau&s;es may &s;lip his Memory, and yet really de&s;ign no wrong. <HI>God forbid</HI> Men &s;hould be hang'd <HI>for forgetting,</HI> while no Fraud is intended in the De&s;ign: Let &s;uch therefore not fear; the Law is not de&s;igned for a Trap to catch Men upon Advantages; Commi&s;&s;ioners and Commi&s;&s;ioners are not Ambu&s;cades to &s;urprize Men.&mdash;I would therefore have no Man fear, in &s;uch Ca&s;es, to make an hone&s;t Di&s;covery, nor <HI>to come again</HI> if afterwards he finds any thing has &s;lipt his Memory, and hone&s;tly di&s;cover and re&s;tore it: Such a Man will meet with Encouragement,
<PB N="27" REF="28">
not Reproach; and the Hone&s;ty of a &s;econd Di&s;covery will be a Confirmation of the Sincerity of the Fir&s;t.</P>
<P>This Law is made to encourage <HI>hone&s;t Men,</HI> and to puni&s;h <HI>Knaves:</HI> 'Tis made to make <HI>Knavi&s;h Debtors</HI> deliver, and <HI>Knavi&s;h Creditors</HI> refund; and in this it &s;eems to have in it all the parts of a perfect Law.</P>
<P>I have been told the Lawyers are hard at work to find out <HI>&s;ome Flaws</HI> in this Act, and &s;tudying how they may &s;till <HI>hamper the Debtor</HI> after he has done all the Act requires, and is actually di&s;charged:&mdash;And really I would have tho&s;e Gentlemen go on with their pious Endeavours; the Di&s;cove|ry of their De&s;igns will only clear the way for the Parliament <HI>another Se&s;&s;ions</HI> to add &s;uch Clau&s;es, as, <HI>if need be,</HI> &s;hall far|ther explain and determine all the Doubts remaining, and bar all the Back-Doors and Outlets to Knavery on one Hand, and Cruelty on the other.</P>
<P>There may, <HI>for ought I know,</HI> be one publick Misfortune in this Bill; with which I &s;hall clo&s;e this Account, and, if po&s;&s;ible, propo&s;e an equivalent.</P>
<P>The Mi&s;chief I &s;peak of is, to the Manufacture of <HI>B$$bing</HI> and <HI>Bullying,</HI> which will be in great Danger of being lo&s;t, to the Ruin and impoveri&s;hing Abundance of poor indu&s;trious Families, who are now maintain'd by the laudable Employ|ment of <HI>Bayliffs,</HI> Bayliffs <HI>Followers, Sergeants, Yeomen, Mar|&s;hal's-Men,</HI> and all the worthy <HI>et cetera's</HI> of <HI>Setters, Spungers, Apprai&s;ers, Brokers, Spunging Hou&s;es,</HI> private <HI>Pri&s;ons,</HI> and the like, who now live on the Life Blood of Trade&s;-men, and help pull down tho&s;e, that are falling fa&s;t enough of them|&s;elves.</P>
<P><HI>Add to the&s;e,</HI> the Fall of Rents in the <HI>Mint</HI> and <HI>Rules,</HI> where Bills begin to be &s;een upon the Doors already, by the Mul|titude of People, who, Creditors <HI>finding this Act will as last compel them to it,</HI> begin to agree with, and voluntarily relea&s;e;&mdash;and where in time the like De&s;olation may be probable to en|&s;ue, as already has happen'd in <HI>White-Fryers.</HI></P>

<HI>Jayl$</HI> will al&s;o be Sharers in this Di&s;a&s;ter, <HI>Waiters, Ten|ders, Turnkeys,</HI> &amp;c. will lo&s;e their Fees; and tho&s;e Ne&s;ts of Cruelty and Mi&s;ery be like a Cage without a Bird.</P>
<P>Multitudes of laborious People, call'd <HI>Sollicitors,</HI> and <HI>Petty fogging Attorneys, Hackney-Bails, Affidavit-Men,</HI> and the like, may now be in Danger to lo&s;e their Employment, lo&s;e the Opportunity of taking large Pay for doing <HI>no Bu&s;ine&s;s,</HI> and charging double Fees for leaving People <HI>wor&s;e than they find the.</HI></P>
<P>Now as as this can no way be immediately prevented, I cannot think I am able to &s;ay any thing more to their Con|&s;olation than to propo&s;e <HI>&s;ome Equivalent</HI> to prevent the entire Ruin of &s;o many <HI>Diligent People,</HI> and their <HI>De|pendents.</HI></P>
<P>And that this may be effectual, I &s;hall divide it as I have done the People.</P>
<P N="1">1. As to the Fraternity of the <HI>Catchpoles,</HI> I propo&s;e to them hone&s;tly, and for the Good of their Country, to a&s;|&s;emble together, and make a Detatchment of Ten Thou|&s;and able-body'd Men out of their Society, <HI>a Number they can very well &s;pare,</HI> and offer their Service on board Her Maje&s;ty's Fleet, to fight in Defence of the Kingdom, and make amends for the Damage they have done at Home, by ruining many Thou&s;and hone&s;t Families they might have &s;av'd; and this 'tis plain, they may do, and yet leave enough of their Trade to execute all the nece&s;&s;ary part of the Law.</P>
