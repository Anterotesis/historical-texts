<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>THE following little Piece was written at the reque&s;t of Mr. SHERIDAN, who thought that whatever was &s;aid of the late Manager, or of his Succe&s;&s;ors, would come with a better grace from a third per&s;on than from the parties concerned. I am happy to have had it in my power to oblige him; and heartily wi&s;h that the candour and indulgence, which the Public have &s;hewn to the&s;e Scenes, may prove a Prelude to the &s;ucce&s;s of his &s;u|perior abilities to entertain them. His laurels being yet green from the fame of the DUEN|NA, revived in my mind the idea of two cha|racters, Crotchet and Sir Dulcimer Dunder, which it is well known that I had in contem|plation about twelve years ago, and which were then intended to &s;erve as an introduction to a Comick Opera. The thought propo&s;ed for the &s;ubject matter of the <HI>Prologue,</HI> was kindly worked up by a friend, who de&s;ired to remain concealed, but who&s;e &s;tile and manner are too familiar to the Stage, not to betray him to the Publick, who will doubtle&s;s be plea&s;ed to &s;ee him di&s;po&s;ed, even in his retirement, to contribute to their amu&s;ements.</P>

<HEAD>PROLOGUE.</HEAD>
<L>Scribblers are Sport&s;men; and as Sport&s;men are,</L>
<L>Some hit, &s;ome mi&s;s, &s;ome poach, and &s;ome beat fair;</L>
<L>This wounds a &s;traggling bird; that often tries,</L>
<L>But never kills; he &s;hoots and &s;huts both eyes:</L>
<L>Like our Train'd Bands, the mark he never hits&mdash;</L>
<L>He &s;corns to &s;ee the murder he commits;</L>
<L>Some will whole coveys take, nineteen in twenty!</L>
<L>And then you &s;mack your lips&mdash;for game is plenty.</L>
<L>In &s;hort, by you their merits mu&s;t be tried&mdash;</L>
<L>And woe to them, who are not qualified!</L>
<L>Another &s;imile we mean to broach&mdash;</L>
<L>A new one too!&mdash;The Stage is a Stage-Coach.&mdash;</L>
<L>A Stage-Coach!&mdash;why?&mdash;I'll tell you if you a&s;k it&mdash;</L>
<L><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Boxes.</NOTE>Here &s;ome take places, and &s;ome mount the ba&s;ket<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Gallery.</NOTE>.</L>
<L>Our Cattle too, that draw the Stage along,</L>
<L>Are of all &s;orts and &s;izes&mdash;weak and &s;trong,</L>
<L>Brown, grey, black, bay, bri&s;k, tame, blind, lame, lean, old and young!</L>
<L>If as we're jogging on, we &s;ometimes &s;top,</L>
<L>Some &s;cold within, and &s;ome a&s;leep will drop,</L>
<L>While &s;ailors and their doxies &s;ing and roar o'top!</L>
<L>The Coachman Manager will &s;ometimes plea&s;e ye&mdash;</L>
<L>But &s;hou'd he &s;tuff the Coach too full, and &s;queeze ye,</L>
<L>You then begin to &s;wear&mdash; "Zounds! &s;hut the door,</L>
<L>"We're cramm'd already&mdash;here's no room for more&mdash;</L>
<L>"You're &s;o damn'd fat&mdash;a little farther, Sir!</L>
<L>"Your elbow's in my &s;tomach&mdash;I can't &s;tir."</L>
<L>Hoit! Hoit! the Coachman then drives on apace,</L>
<L>And &s;mack! with other &s;tages runs a race.</L>
<L>Thro' thick and thin we da&s;h, now up, now down,</L>
<L>Now rai&s;e a du&s;t, now rattling thro' the Town;</L>
<L>Now fir&s;t, now la&s;t, now jolted, crack! we fall.</L>
<L>Laugh'd, pelted, hooted at, and damn'd by all!</L>
<L><PB N="19" REF="22">Your late Old Coachman, tho' oft &s;pla&s;h'd by dirt,</L>
<L>And out in many a &s;torm, retires unhurt;</L>
<L>Enjoys your kind reward for all his pains,</L>
<L>And now to other hands re&s;igns the reins.</L>
<L>But the new partners of the old Machine,</L>
<L>Hoping you'll find it &s;nug, and tight and clean,</L>
<L>Vow that with much civility they'll treat you,</L>
<L>Will drive you well, and plea&s;antly will &s;eat you,</L>
<L>The road is not all turnpike&mdash;and what wor&s;e is,</L>
<L>They can't in&s;ure your watches or your pur&s;es;</L>
<L>But they'll a&s;&s;ure you, that their be&s;t endeavour</L>
<L>Shall not be wanting to obtain your favour;</L>
<L>Which gain'd&mdash;Gee up! the Old Stage will run for ever!</L>
