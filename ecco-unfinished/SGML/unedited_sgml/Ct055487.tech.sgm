<HEAD>REFLECTIONS
ON THE
Prohibition Act.</HEAD>
<OPENER>London, <DATE>Jan. 10. 1707-08.</DATE>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>BY yours of the fir&s;t In&s;tant, you require
my Opinion about the <HI>Prohibition Act,</HI>
in Terms manife&s;tly indicating your
Fear and Concern lea&s;t we &s;hould be deprived
of it. I know not what Rea&s;ons you may have
for &s;uch Apprehen&s;ions; and perhaps You and
I never differ'd more then in the Matter of the
pre&s;ent Subject; about which I &s;hall hone&s;tly
and plainly give you my Thoughts, and handle
the Point with that Freedom and Sincerity
which the Weight of the Subject de&s;erves, be|ing
under no Re&s;triction that I know of to the
contrary. To which Purpo&s;e I &s;hall lay down
the Two following Po&s;itions.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="3">
I. That the Act of Parliament prohibiting
the U&s;e of the Manufactured Silks, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> of <HI>In|dia,
China,</HI> and <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> in this Nation, is one
of the happie&s;t and be&s;t Laws we enjoy, re|lating
to Trade.</P>
<P>II. That we are not in any Danger of lo&s;ing
it; that is to &s;ay, that it is not like to be Re|pealed;
but on the contrary, will &s;tand firm
and un&s;haken to future Ages, notwith&s;tanding
the De&s;igns and Attempts of all its Adver|&s;aries.</P>
<P>1.
That the <HI>Prohibition Act</HI> is one of the
happie&s;t and be&s;t Laws we enjoy relating to
Trade.</P>
<P>To prove this, there is nothing further Ne|ce&s;&s;ary
then to con&s;ider the Circum&s;tance and
Condition of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Manufactures for the
Space of &s;ix or &s;even Years before and after
that Law took Place, and fairly to compare
them together; by which the Nece&s;&s;ity, as
well as the U&s;efulne&s;s of that &s;ea&s;onable Act,
will evidently appear, to all unbia&s;ed and un|prejudiced
Per&s;ons.</P>
<P>The Places where the&s;e Manufactures, <HI>before
the late Inundation of</HI> India <HI>Goods,</HI> more e&s;pe|cially
flouri&s;hed, were <HI>London, Canterbury</HI> and
<HI>Norwich;</HI> together with the Counties of <HI>E&s;&s;ex,
<PB N="5" REF="4">
Suffolk, Norfolk, Hartford</HI> and <HI>Cambridge,</HI> who&s;e
Employment chiefly con&s;i&s;ted in making <HI>Yarn</HI>
for <HI>London</HI> and <HI>Norwich.</HI></P>
<P>As to <HI>London,</HI> the Manufactures were almo&s;t
lo&s;t by the coming in of <HI>East India</HI> Goods, for
divers Years before the obtaining of the <HI>$rohi|bition;</HI>
the Trade&s;man generally undone, whole
Streets uninhabited, many of our be&s;t Arti&s;ts
left the Kingdom; &s;ome went to <HI>Holland,</HI> &s;ome
to <HI>Ireland,</HI> others to <HI>Scotland.</HI> Tho&s;e that re|main'd
were not half employ'd; the re&s;t redu|ced
to the greate&s;t Extremities, of whom many
begged their Bread, and were forced to be main|tain'd
by their Pari&s;hes.</P>
<P>And if it fared thus with <HI>London,</HI> it could
not be much better with <HI>Norwich,</HI> who&s;e Nu|merous
Families had nothing to depend on, but
their own Manufactures, which tho&s;e of <HI>India</HI>
&s;o directly oppo&s;e: No wonder therefore if the
former &s;unk, whil&s;t the other prevail'd, and
le&s;s wonder &s;till, they &s;hould &s;o heartily join
with the Manufacturers of <HI>London</HI> to &s;eek Re|lief
<HI>where it was only to be had.</HI></P>
<P>As for <HI>Canterbury,</HI> the Mi&s;ery of the People
at the Time I &s;peak of, was &s;carce to be cre|dited,
their Manufacture was intirely lo&s;t and
given up, the Manufacturers fled from their
Habitations in &s;uch Multitudes, that at the
Time the <HI>Prohibition Act</HI> pa&s;&s;ed, that famous
<PB N="6" REF="5">
City was reduced from <HI>near a Thou&s;and, to
about Fifty Looms.</HI></P>
<P>The Counties before-mention'd, depending
chiefly upon <HI>London</HI> and <HI>Norwich,</HI> for buying
up their <HI>Yarn,</HI> bore an equal Share in the Com|mon
Calamity, were left without Employment,
&s;ome turning them&s;elves to new Ways of get|ting
their Bread, others &s;eeking for it in Foreign
Countries, leaving their Wives and Children to
the Pari&s;hes; by which Means we were not only
&s;trip'd of the Profitable Labour of many thou|&s;and
Hands, <HI>the least of which is of more Value
to this Nation than all the Manufactured Silks of</HI>
India, China <HI>and</HI> Per&s;ia, but were forced to con|vey
both our <HI>Art and our Hands</HI> to Foreign
Countries, unhappily teaching them to fight us
at our own Weapons, and to be Ma&s;ters of <HI>all
our My&s;tery, and all our Trade at the$ame Time.</HI>
And of what Con&s;equence this might have been
to <HI>Great Britain,</HI> woful Experience would be|fore
this have taught us all, had not the Legi|&s;lative
Power intervened, and prevented <HI>us by
this happy, &s;ea&s;onable and u&s;eful Act.</HI></P>
<P>Let us now take a View of the pre&s;ent State
and Condition of Trade in the Places and Coun|ties
aforemention'd, that were thus Sunk, De|&s;erted
and Depopulated by the&s;e <HI>Indian Manu|factures.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="6">
And tho' it mu&s;t be own'd that the Space of
<HI>Eighteen Months</HI> given by the Act to the Deal|ers
in tho&s;e Commodities, to di&s;po&s;e of the va$t
Quantities of them which were then in the Na|tion,
together with the Influence of the Com|panies,
and the Bent of all Sorts and Degrees of
People towards the&s;e Goods, did nece&s;&s;arily
&s;u&s;pend for &s;ome Time the De&s;ign and Influence
of this Law; yet, God be thanked, the Time
is now come, when all Men that do not &s;hut
their Eyes, both &s;ee and feel the Benefit and
Advantage of it. It cannot be expected that any
Thing in the World can re&s;tore the Manufa|ctures
of <HI>Great Britain</HI> to their full Advantage
and Height, &s;o long as the War continues; and
we mu&s;t be all content to &s;ubmit to the Common
Inconveniencies, till Peace be re&s;tored to <HI>Europe.</HI>
But as far as our pre&s;ent Circum&s;tances will ad|mit,
this &s;ea&s;onable Act has relieved us; and I
dare adventure to &s;ay, effectually too, as plainly
appears in the following In&s;tances.</P>
<P>In <HI>London,</HI> the Maker has a Market for his
Goods, Arti&s;ts and Work-men <HI>are return'd from
the Places of their Di&s;per&s;ion, and find a full Em|ployment
for all their Hands; the empty Streets
and Hou&s;es are again Inhabited,</HI> and higher
Rents paid for them than before. <HI>Several New
Species</HI> of Manufactures &s;et up, and every Day
<HI>increa&s;ing and improving upon our Hands;</HI> a great
Part of which are Exported to our Neighbours,
and as much in Vogue with them as they are in
<PB N="8" REF="7">
Fa&s;hion with us: And I doubt not, but the
Export of the&s;e Goods will be much higher yet,
if we continue the general U&s;e and Fa&s;hion of
them at Home; for it mu&s;t always be noted,
<HI>That Fa&s;hions generally reach as far as the Hon|our
and Reputation of a Nation Influenceth,</HI> of
which we have too pregnant an In&s;tance in a
Neighbouring Country.</P>
<P><HI>Norwich</HI> gets up again apace; they have a
Market for their Goods, and Employment for
their Hands, and their Circum&s;tance being the
&s;ame, it fares with them ju&s;t as it does with
<HI>London. They fell,</HI> and Thanks be to God and
our Legi&s;lators, <HI>they are ri&s;en together.</HI></P>
<P>The Ca&s;e mu&s;t needs be the &s;ame al&s;o with
Re&s;pect to the &s;everal Counties, who&s;e Employ|ment
depends upon <HI>London</HI> and <HI>Norwich,</HI> as
before was noted; &s;o that there needs nothing
more to be Remarked in Relation to them, then
that <HI>their Affairs are Re&s;tored and Retrieved in
an exact Proportion to that of tho&s;e Two great
Marts.</HI></P>
<P>As for <HI>Canterbury,</HI> the Influence of this Act
is more vi&s;ibly &s;een there, than in any Place in
the Nation. <HI>That City was even become De&s;o|late;
they are now return'd to their Homes,</HI> as
as before they left them, <HI>in Shoals and Compa|$es.</HI>
Their Hou&s;es and their Bellies are full.
They rather want Hands then Work; <HI>and
<PB N="9" REF="8">
there is at this Day neither Complaint nor Decay
among&s;t them for lack of Employment.</HI></P>
<P>We ought now to con&s;ider this Law as it
Effects the Nation in general, <HI>in its Merchan|dizes,
Manufactures and Lands.</HI> But I mu&s;t be
very &s;hort in the&s;e Particulars. And I think I
need take Notice of the <HI>Turky</HI> and <HI>Italian</HI> Mer|chants
only, under the fir&s;t Head; who like all
other Exporters, <HI>cannot po&s;&s;ibly carry their Trade
farther than the Vend of their Imports will Sup|port.</HI>
And I take <HI>it to be Demon&s;tration that
the&s;e Gentlemen mu&s;t long &s;ince have laid down
the greate&s;t Part of their Bu&s;ine&s;s, if this Law
had not interven'd.</HI> Our Silken Manufacture at
Home was both &s;upplanted and &s;upplied by <HI>In|dian</HI>
Goods. Upon which Account we could
have no Demand or Occa&s;ion for Raw Silks
from <HI>Turky</HI> and <HI>Italy,</HI> and &s;etting that Commo|dity
a&s;ide, there are no other Effects in tho&s;e
Countries, &s;ufficient to carry on a Valuable
Trade, that can be di&s;po&s;ed of in <HI>Great Britain.</HI>
So that we are intirely indebted to this Act for
the mo&s;t, both of our Exports and Imports,
to and from tho&s;e Places; the Advantage and
Profit of which redounds to the Manufacturer as
well as to the Merchant; &s;o that we are at
once beholding to this Law, under the pre&s;ent
Head of our Con&s;ideration, for the Circulation
of our Money, the Pre&s;ervation of onr Com|merce,
and the Employment of our People.
But there are other Advantages that attend this
<PB N="10" REF="9">
Act, which the People of <HI>Leeds, Halifax, Wake|field,
Beedal,</HI> and other Places in <HI>York&s;hire</HI> par|take
of; where New Manufactures are &s;et up
for <HI>Tar$,</HI> great Quantities of which are &s;ent
every Week to <HI>London</HI> and <HI>Norwich,</HI> and are
there Manufactured. Many other Places like|wi&s;e
in <HI>Great Britain</HI> have begun other Manu|factures,
which are like to prove more or le&s;s
Profitable, according to the Skill of the Di|rectors;
all Hands here find Work. There is
no want in the&s;e Places of publick Work-Hou&s;es
for the Willing Labourer of any Sex,
Age or Condition.</P>
<P>It would be wa&s;ting of Time to &s;hew that
that this Law is of great Advantage to the
Landed Men of the Nation. I am per&s;waded
there is not one Gentleman of an E&s;tate in it,
that is not throughly convinced of the Truth of
the A&s;&s;ertion. But that nothing may pa&s;s <HI>Gra|tis
dictum,</HI> let it only be con&s;ider'd, That this
I&s;land can neither increa&s;e nor &s;upport its
Riches, but by Trade and Commerce. This is
the Life and Blood of the Nation, which as
from the Heart, di&s;per&s;eth and communicates
Vigour and Influence to the Whole, and every
Branch and Member of it. And &s;o far as this
Law has retriev'd, reviv'd and improv'd our
Manufactures, &s;o far as it has enabled us to con|tinue
and increa&s;e our Profitable Exports, and
the Produce of them; &s;o far as it has recalled
our Exiles, and &s;trengthen'd our Hands, <HI>&s;o far
<PB N="11" REF="10">
it has advantaged our Lands,</HI> increa&s;ed our
Rents, and enabled the Tenants to pay both
the QUEEN and the Landlord. I hope
there is now enough &s;aid, and nothing &s;aid but
Matter of Fact, to &s;upport and e&s;tabli&s;h my fir&s;t
Po&s;ition concerning the U&s;efulne&s;s and Value
of this happy Law; and there is nothing left
under this Head, but to return our ju&s;t Ac|knowledgments
to tho&s;e Worthy Patriots, who
received &s;o kindly <HI>the Application of the Di&s;tre&s;|&s;ed;</HI>
apprehended &s;o clearly <HI>the Cau&s;e of their
Mi&s;ery;</HI> relieved &s;o &s;ea&s;onably <HI>a &s;inking People,</HI>
and e&s;tabli&s;h'd &s;o firmly <HI>this glorious Law.</HI> May
the Ble&s;&s;ings of Heaven attend them and their
Po&s;terity, and be as la&s;ting as the happy Effects
of this Act.</P>
<P>It is time now to e&s;tabli&s;h the &s;econd Po&s;iti|on.
And the very repeating of it, will I hope
make the Ta&s;k ea&s;ie enough. It runs thus.</P>
<P>2. We are not in any Danger of lo&s;ing this
Act, that is to &s;ay, it is not like to be Re|peal'd:
But on the contrary, will &s;tand firm
and un&s;haken to future Ages, notwith&s;tanding
the De&s;igns and Attempts of its Adver&s;aries.</P>
<P>I. And fir&s;t I think this Act will &s;tand by
rea&s;on of its own intrin&s;ick Worth and Value.</P>
<P>II. Becau&s;e its Enemies are few.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="11">
III. Becau&s;e they who &s;hall attempt to Repeal
it, may find the Task more Difficult then they
are aware of.</P>
<P>IV. Becau&s;e of the Mi&s;ery and De&s;olation the
Repealing it would occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>1. As to the fir&s;t Rea&s;on why the Act &s;hould
&s;tand, I need not &s;ay any Thing here; the
whole foregoing Di&s;cour&s;e, being a Demon&s;tra|tion
of its Worth, Value and U&s;efulne&s;s to this
Nation.</P>
<P>2. And as to the &s;econd Rea&s;on, unle&s;s the
Ladies be reckon'd in the Number, I believe
the A&s;&s;ertion is actually and literally true. <HI>Few
doubtle&s;s they are, if compared with the Number
or Value of tho&s;e for who&s;e &s;ake the Bill was
Enacted;</HI> I &s;peak Politically, for by the latter,
<HI>I mean not only the Manufactures, but the whole
Nation.</HI> After all, I am more at a lo&s;s to know
who <HI>are Enemies to this Law,</HI> then in concern
for their Numbers. I know the Cau&s;e of Fear,
were it freely own'd, can proceed from nothing
but <HI>the Strength and Influence of the Companies.</HI>
But I mu&s;t crave leave to &s;ay, that People may
fear where no Fear is, and fancy they are in
Danger, when no body de&s;igns to hurt them;
and excepting &s;ome Rumors about the Town,
perhaps indu&s;triou&s;ly &s;pread Abroad, to try the
Temper of the People; I have good rea&s;on to
believe <HI>this to be the true State of the Matter.</HI>
<PB N="13" REF="12">
The <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Companies are made up of the
Wealthie&s;t Merchants and Gentry of the Nati|on,
who have large E&s;tates, and great Stakes in
the Government: I hope mo&s;t of them, I am
&s;ure &s;ome of them, have the Welfare and Pro&s;|perity
of their Country more at Heart than to
to Wi&s;h, much le&s;s to Endeavour <HI>the Repealing
to this Act;</HI> and it is my real Opinion, that
there is no &s;uch De&s;ign on Foot, <HI>I cannot think
&s;o hardly</HI> of the&s;e Gentlemen, and there can be
no Danger from any other Quarter. But &s;up|po&s;ing,
not allowing the wor&s;t of the Ca&s;e, I
mu&s;t &s;till add,</P>
<P>3. Even the united Company it &s;elf, Strong
and Potent as it is, might, and I hope would
mi&s;carry in the Attempt. The Matter in con|te&s;t
would then be, <HI>Whether the Nation &s;hould
&s;ink that the Company might ri&s;e? Whether the
Staple Manufactures of</HI> Great Britain <HI>&s;hould be
once more de&s;troyed, to exalt the tempting Exce&s;&s;es
of</HI> India, China <HI>and</HI> Per&s;ia? <HI>Whether our be&s;t Ar|ti&s;ts
&s;hould make a Second Experiment to In&s;truct
our Neighbours in our Mi&s;$ries and Improve|ments,
that we may &s;trave more Luxuriou&s;ly in</HI>
Indian-<HI>Habits? Whether we &s;hould Empty our
&s;elves of our Numbers and Strength to make more
room for prohibited Goods? And whether the
whole mu&s;t be Impoveri&s;h'd to Enrich a few?</HI> If
the&s;e Things can be dige&s;ted, &s;uch an Attempt
might po&s;&s;ibly prevail. But in the mean time,
I think we are &s;afe enough; and I think we are
<PB N="14" REF="13">
&s;o, <HI>becau&s;e we are &s;afe in the Honour and Ju&s;tice
of our Legi&s;lators.</HI> Tho&s;e that made this Law
have Power to pre&s;erve it; and the Value of it
is too precious to part with for &s;uch Gugaws as
we mu&s;t have in Exchange for it; e&s;pecially
when by loo&s;ing it, we intail upon the Nation
&s;uch <HI>a deluge of Mi&s;eries</HI> as are hinted above.
Not that all the Misfortunes that would come
upon us are there enumerated; there are others
yet behind that would effectually do our Bu&s;i|ne&s;s,
and render us as compleatly mi&s;erable as
our Grand Enemy could wi&s;h, and our own
Folly de&s;erve. Of the&s;e I will only mention
Three, as &s;o many &s;tanding Arguments for my
Fourth Rea&s;on why this Act will not be Re|pealed,
<HI>viz.</HI> Becau&s;e of the Mi&s;ery and De&s;ola|tion
it would occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>4. The&s;e Three Misfortunes are the carrying
out of all our Bullion. The &s;uddenne&s;s of the
Blow; and the probable Con&s;equences of it.</P>
<P>It cannot be denyed that the pre&s;ent Trade to
<HI>India,</HI> under all its Re&s;trictions, <HI>requires an Ex|port
of Bullion much greater, not only than the
Nation can &s;pare, but indeed than it po&s;&s;e&s;&s;eth.</HI>
Now if this Act were Repealed, it mu&s;t be in
favour of the Companies, and on purpo&s;e to en|large
their Trade and Dealing with tho&s;e Coun|tries.
This mu&s;t of cour&s;e require a greater Ex|port
of Bullion, which as our Ca&s;e &s;tands, can
be no otherwi&s;e &s;upplied <HI>but from the Coin;</HI>
<PB N="15" REF="14">
which &s;ingle Point con&s;idered, is of the la&s;t
Con&s;equence to this Nation, and needs no Ap|plication.
I &s;uppo&s;e every Body will readily
grant, That the Companies Traded to <HI>India</HI>
much higher for the Seven Years preceding the
Act, than in the Seven Years that followed it;
the Con&s;equence of which nece&s;&s;arily was, <HI>That
in the former Seven Years they carried out &s;eve|ral
Hundred Thou&s;and Pounds</HI> per Annum <HI>in
Bullion, more than in the latter:</HI> Which Sum,
whatever it be, is &s;aved to us purely by force
of this Act.</P>
<P>The &s;uddenne&s;s of the Blow is a &s;tuning Ar|ticle.
The Manufacturers Livelyhood was not
heretofore &s;natched from them at one Stroke,
as it would be in this Ca&s;e; they were enured
to Want, and learned to Starve by degrees; but
by R$pealing this Act, <HI>Poverty would come upon
them like an armed Man;</HI> &s;uddenly, inevitably,
<HI>and there would be none to help:</HI> And what Per|plexity,
what Mi&s;ery, what De&s;olation; nay,
what Agitations and Convul&s;ions all this might
occa&s;ion, is much fitter for private Reflection,
than publick Repre&s;entation. I love not to
mention <HI>the beginnings of &s;uch Woes,</HI> and tremble
to think <HI>now they would End.</HI></P>
<P>Since therefore there is &s;o much Good alrea|dy
procured by this Law, and &s;o much more to
be expected; &s;ince &s;uch Mi&s;ery mu&s;t needs at|tend
the Repeal of it, and perhaps more than is
<PB N="16" REF="15">
fit to be &s;ugge&s;ted. Why &s;hould it be Ima|gined,
much le&s;s Credited, That the Thing can
be effected, or ever will be attempted? 'Tis too
hard and injurious a Thought <HI>upon the Compa|nies;</HI>
and 'tis a di&s;honourable and unworthy Re|flection
<HI>upon the Government.</HI> It will not, it
never can be; 'tis raving and phren&s;ie to &s;up|po&s;e
it, becau&s;e it would be madne&s;s, and a ju|dicial
De&s;ertion to De&s;ign it; 'tis putting an
End to the War <HI>the &s;horte&s;t Way.</HI> In &s;hort, 'tis
French Slavery, and Wooden Shooes all over.
I will only add, That <HI>&s;o long as we are Ble&s;t
with our pre&s;ent Con&s;titution, and a Britti&s;h Par|liament;
&s;o long I verily believe, this Act will
&s;tand firm and un&s;haken;</HI> that is, I hope and
tru&s;t, &s;o long as the Sun and Moon endureth.</P>
<P>Thus I have done with the main part of your
Letter; there is nothing now behind but to
Con&s;ider the Four Arguments, for the &s;etting
a&s;ide this Bill, which you &s;ay you find &s;o often
in &s;ome Peoples Mouths. In Truth, <HI>the&s;e Ar|guments</HI>
as you are plea&s;ed to call them, are not
only fo <HI>Weak, but &s;o Provoking,</HI> that I &s;carce
know with what Language to treat them; but
becau&s;e you reque&s;t it, I will &s;et them down,
and endeavour to Expo&s;e them as they well de|ferve.</P>
<P><HI>Object.</HI>
1. It &s;eems, the Exports of our Wool|len
Manufactures are le&s;&s;ened &s;ince this Act
was made.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="16">
2. Our Imports of Wrought Silk from our
<HI>European</HI> Neighbours are increa&s;ed.</P>
<P>3. By Repealing this Act, it is not de&s;ign|ed
to take away the Employment of the Peo|ple,
but only to change the <HI>Prohibition</HI> into
an Impo&s;ition.</P>
<P>4. The Nece&s;&s;ities of the Nation require
this to be done, to rai&s;e a FUND for the
WAR.</P>
<P>1. The fir&s;t of the&s;e Arguments is deceit|fully
laid down, and would conclude no|thing,
&s;uppo&s;ing it to be true. To convince
you of this, I would only de&s;ire you to con|&s;ider
what Part of our Manufactures are le&s;s
Exported then heretofore. If this be affirm|ed
of our Fine Manufactures made of Wool,
and Silk and Wool, <HI>it is a Mi&s;take in Fact;</HI>
for there never was a Time when &s;o many of
the&s;e, which directly oppo&s;e the <HI>Indian</HI> Goods,
were Exported to <HI>HOLLAND, HAM|BURGH</HI>
and <HI>PORTUGAL,</HI> as of late
Years. And there is a plain Rea&s;on for the
Encrea&s;e of the&s;e Exports, to wit, the &s;mall
Quantity of prohibited Manufactures brought
into <HI>GREAT BRITAIN,</HI> &s;ince that Act
commenced: For &s;ince that Time, our own
Fine Manufactures have &s;upplied their Place
both at Home and Abroad. And if it be af|firmed
<PB N="18" REF="17">
in re&s;pect only of our Cour&s;er Wool|lens;
all it will conclude is, that we &s;uffer
much in this Article, for want of TRADE
with the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Dominions, which no body
will deny: But then this Misfortune is not
to be imputed to the <HI>Prohibition Act,</HI> but to
the Hou&s;e of <HI>BO&V;RBON</HI>'s &s;eizing of, and
hindring our TRADE to tho&s;e Countries.</P>
<P>2. As to the &s;econd Argument, 'tis wholly
deny'd. Men may affirm what they plea&s;e.
But I in&s;i&s;t upon it, and the Dealers in Fo|reign
Silks know it to be true; That from
the Year One Thou&s;and Six Hundred and
Sixty there never was &s;o little of this Manu|facture
imported into <HI>GREAT BRITAIN,</HI>
as within the&s;e Six Years la&s;t pa&s;t; and a
great Part even of this too, is run in upon
us by the Smugler and unfair Trader, with|out
paying the Cu&s;toms. The <HI>Britti&s;h</HI> Ma|nufacturer
pays in our own Markets, Ten or
Fifteen Pound <HI>Per Cent.</HI> more for Raw Silk
than the <HI>Dutch</HI> do, by rea&s;on the latter are
allowed to draw back the Cu&s;toms. But this
Mi&s;chief cannot be imputed to any Deficien|cy
in the <HI>Prohibition Act,</HI> but to the want of
due Care in paying the Cu&s;toms upon the
Imports of the&s;e Goods back again, and the
Practi&s;es of the unfair Dealer.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="18">
3. The third Argument is both Deceitful
and Fal&s;e, by pretending to in&s;inuate, that a
high Duty upon <HI>Indian</HI> Goods would &s;ecure
the Manufacture at Home. It is &s;omething
&s;trange that the Manufacturer &s;hould be &s;ecu|red
by that which de&s;troys the Manufacture,
and that a Weaver in <HI>Spittle-fields</HI> &s;hould thrive
the better, becau&s;e <HI>Indian</HI> Silks are Sold the
Dearer. Ala&s;s it is not the Rate or Price,
but the Quantity of the&s;e Goods that effects
the Profit of the Importer, and the Ruin of
the Manufacturer. And is it po&s;&s;ible, that <HI>an
Impo&s;ition</HI> can prevent great Quantities from
coming in? It is not pretended, on the con|trary,
an Impo&s;ition is laid on purpo&s;e that
they might be brought in. <HI>Nothing can keep
them out but a Prohibition; and nothing can
let them in but an Impo&s;ition.</HI> Be&s;ides, Expe|rience
has taught us, that a high Duty is a
Bait to &s;ome Men, that never fails to tempt
them to defraud the Government, and preju|dice
the Manufacturer and fair Dealer. And
indeed the Fraud is but too Practicable, by
pretending to Export them, and then running
them in again; &s;o that whatever Price is paid
by the Buyer for the Goods that have fairly
paid the High Duty; to be &s;ure the&s;e that
are Run may be afforded Cheap enough, en|tirely
to de&s;troy the Poor Remnant of <HI>Britti&s;h</HI>
Manufacture, the other would leave us. Be|&s;ides,
were the&s;e Commodities, &s;uch as could
<PB N="20" REF="19">
not ea&s;ily be Run, and did they come from
Countries that took off Proportionable Quan|tities
of our own Produce in Exchange for
them; it were yet to be con&s;ider'd what Duty
ought to be laid on them, to bring them up|on
a Level with our own Manufactures; for
this mu&s;t be done before the Manufacture at
Home can be &s;ecured. Now the Value of the
Labour of the People of <HI>India</HI> bearing no
greater Proportion to ours, then One does to
Six; it follow, that to effect this Secu|rity,
no le&s;s Impo&s;ition can be laid on <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI>
Goods than Five Hundred Pound <HI>per
Cent.</HI> as was done in the CASE of the <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI>
Sugars, to &s;ecure the Produce of our
<HI>A$$rican</HI> Colonies, which had the de&s;igned
$$$ect, and amounted to a Prohibition; for
&s;ince the Pa&s;&s;ing of that ACT, none of tho&s;e
Sugars have been con&s;umed in <HI>Great Britain.</HI>
I do not &s;ay, were this Impo&s;ition laid on,
that the <HI>Britti&s;h</HI> Manufactures could be Se|cure;
and it is plain, no Impo&s;ition can make
them &s;o; for &s;uch is the Fondne&s;&s;e $$f all Sorts
of People for the&s;e Goods, that va&s;t Quanti|ties
of them would go off, let the Price be
what it will. Nor does it at all concern the
Manufacturer, at what Rate the&s;e Goods are
Sold, it being the Quantity, and the Oppo&s;i|$ion,
and not the Price that de&s;troys us. And
this De&s;truction of our Manufactures would
&s;till be more certain, by the Running of the
<PB N="21" REF="20">
Goods, and the Practi&s;e of Smuglers and un|fair
Dealers, as before was noted.</P>
<P>4. The fourth Argument is a Home one
indeed; and if it be true, which God forbid,
'tis the be&s;t News the <HI>French</HI> King ever heard
&s;ince his Head was crown'd, and the wor&s;t
that ever befel this Nation. But pray, Sir,
who are the Men that are &s;o Bold as to a&s;&s;ert,
<HI>That the Nece&s;&s;ities of the Nation require this to
be done, to rai&s;e a Fund for the War?</HI> That is
to &s;ay, that we are &s;o Exhau&s;ted, that a Year|ly
Fund of 100000 <HI>l.</HI> cannot be found out
without Repealing this Act. I cannot forbear
to think that &s;uch Notions as the&s;e, and &s;o &s;tu|diou&s;ly
advanced, have a very evil Tendency
in them, and are meant to di&s;pirit and di&s;cou|rage
the People, to make them weary and di&s;|&s;atisfied
with the Ju&s;t and Nece&s;&s;ary Mea&s;ures
we are ingaged in, and the Managers of the
War; to Expo&s;e the Nakedne&s;s of the Land to
its Enemies, and to Weaken both the Hearts
and Han$$$ of its Friends. <HI>Ways and Means
are Parliamentary Affairs;</HI> and it is fit the Me|thods
of rai&s;ing Money &s;hould be left to tho&s;e
who&s;e Province it is to &s;upply Her Maje&s;ty's
Ju&s;t Occa&s;ions, and to take Care of the Subject.
But if any Regard is to be had to the A&s;&s;erti|on
above, it would render the&s;e Two Things
Incompatible; for if no Money can be rai&s;ed
without Repealing the <HI>Prohibition Act, either
the Money mu&s;t be wanted, or the Nation mu&s;t be
<PB N="22" REF="21">
ruined;</HI> by either of which Accidents, the
Common Cau&s;e is given up. This is the <HI>Di|lemma</HI>
the&s;e Gentlemen would bring us into;
becau&s;e this is the Condition they would have
it believed we are in. I have not Patience to
dwell any longer on this Subject; but hope I
may &s;ay with good A&s;&s;urance that this War
may and will be carry'd on, and I hope effe|ctually
too, without running any great Ri&s;que
to the Nation; much more without expo&s;ing
our Selves and Po&s;terity to utter Ruine, to
E&s;tabli&s;h a Fund for One Hundred Thou&s;and
Pounds <HI>per Annum.</HI></P>
