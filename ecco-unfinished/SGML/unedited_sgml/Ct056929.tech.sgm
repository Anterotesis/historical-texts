<HEAD>A
LETTER to M^r HOW.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AFTER &s;uch an Account as you have
given of your &s;elf in the Five fir&s;t Pages
of your Book, with the Aver&s;ion you
have to any thing which &s;hou'd interrupt you in
your more <HI>Reclu&s;e</HI> Studies; I pre&s;ume no Man
cou'd imagin you would break thorough your own
Mea&s;ures to attack a <HI>poor Prefacer,</HI> as you call me,
and wholly quitting the Argument, amu&s;e the
World, and content your &s;elf to La&s;h the Author
with the Severity of your Wit.</P>
<P>Herein, Sir, I mu&s;t own, that not only your
Opponent, but all the Town &s;eem Di&s;appointed
exceedingly, that Mr. <HI>How,</HI> who thinks the Sub|ject
not worth An&s;wering, &s;hou'd trouble his Head,
or &s;pend his Time about the Impertinence of a
<HI>&s;orry Prefacer.</HI></P>
<P>When I Addre&s;s'd the Preface to you, I thought
I had &s;o carefully Revis'd both it and the Book,
that, as I mention'd to you, I cou'd no-where be
<PB N="2" REF="3" MS="Y">
tax'd with Exceeding the Rules of Charity and
Good Manners.</P>
<P>And tho' I wou'd always make them both my
Rule, yet I thought my &s;elf oblig'd to it more
now than ordinarily, by how much the per&s;on to
whom, and the per&s;ons of whom I wrote, were
equally known and very much valued by me; and
I did not que&s;tion but I &s;hou'd either not be Repli'd
to at all, or it wou'd be done with the Charity of a
<HI>Chri&s;tian,</HI> the Civility of a <HI>Gentleman,</HI> and the
Force and Vigour of a <HI>Scholar.</HI></P>
<P>But &s;ince it &s;eems good to you, Sir, to de&s;cend
&s;o far below your &s;elf as to quit the Di&s;pute offer'd,
and fall upon me per&s;onally, and to mix Raillery
and Reproach with your Argument, <HI>which, I am
&s;ure, you know too well to think betters the Cau&s;e:</HI> You
mu&s;t blame your &s;elf, Sir, for Obliging me in my
own Defence to be a little freer with you than
otherwi&s;e I &s;hou'd have thought had become me.</P>
<P>Nor, Sir, &s;hou'd I have engag'd with you, even
in my own Defence, knowing I am to &s;truggle
with &s;o unequal a Match both as to your Learning
and Reputation, had I not &s;een your Book differ
&s;o much from your Con&s;tant Character; and par|don
me, Sir, for the Word, <HI>in many places from
the Truth.</HI></P>
<P>And &s;ince I am oblig'd thus publickly to Ani|madvert
upon my Superiors, for &s;uch I own you
to be both in Learning and Office,</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="4" MS="Y">
I &s;hall ask your Leave to lay down &s;everal
Mi&s;takes, upon which I mu&s;t be allow'd to &s;up|po&s;e
you have gone in the Cen&s;ures which you
have made; which Suppo&s;itions I draw from the
whole Tenour of your Writing.</P>
<P>I pre&s;ume, Sir, that you are mi&s;taken in the&s;e
Four Points, in the <HI>Per&s;on, Temper, Profe&s;&s;ion,</HI> and
<HI>Intention</HI> of the Author.</P>
<P>Which Mi&s;takes, I &s;hall venture to &s;uppo&s;e,
are the Rea&s;ons which moved you to treat your
Adver&s;ary with &s;o much indecent Contempt.</P>
<P>As to my Per&s;on and Temper: 'Tis true, Sir,
I have cho&s;en to conceal my Name; and though,
bating Human Frailty, Sins and Misfortunes, I know
no Rea&s;on why the Argument &s;hould be a&s;ham'd
of the Author, or the Author of the Argument:
Yet when I con&s;ider'd how con&s;tant a practice it
is in the World to An&s;wer an Argument with Re|criminations
in&s;tead of Rea&s;onings, I thought it be&s;t
to continue retir'd, that the Ca&s;e I had enter'd upon
might not come clogg'd with the dead Weight of
the Meanne&s;s and Imperfections of the Author.</P>
<P>I need not go back to the In&s;tance of our Savi|our,
who&s;e Arguments were Confronted with the
Contempt of that Que&s;tion, <HI>Is not this the Car|penter's
Son?</HI> For I find that even Mr. <HI>How</HI> him|&s;elf
<PB N="4" REF="5" MS="Y">
wou'd have &s;earch'd my Character to have
compleated his Remarks with Per&s;onal Reflecti|ons.</P>
<P>And yet I cannot imagine what Relation my
Name has to the Argument; it cou'd be on|ly
u&s;eful to furni&s;h you with &s;omething in my
Character to Reproach me with; which, <HI>God
knows, you might have found enough of.</HI></P>
<P>But what wou'd all this be to the Point in hand?
The Occa&s;ional Conformity of Di&s;&s;enters is not
Condemn'd or Defended by the Names of Authors
on either &s;ide, but by Truth, Scripture, and Rea|&s;on.</P>
<P><HI>Thou was't altogether born in Sin,</HI> &s;ays the High-Prie&s;t,
and the Elders of the <HI>Sanhedrim</HI> to the
Poor Man whom chri&s;t had heal'd; <HI>and doe&s;t thou
teach us?</HI> And yet the poor Man was in the Right;
and if I am &s;o, though I was the meane&s;t and mo&s;t
&s;candalous of Scriblers, is my Argument the
wor&s;e?</P>
<P>But, Sir, to An&s;wer all tho&s;e Particulars, and
let you know that I am not altogether &s;o &s;hy of
my Name as you imagine, I &s;hall give you a Ge|nuine
hone&s;t Account of my &s;elf, and then my
Name is at your Service.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, Sir, I am to tell you, that I am, and ac|knowledge
my &s;elf to be, po&s;&s;e&s;s'd with a &s;trong
Aver&s;ion to Doubling and Shifting in Points of
<PB N="5" REF="6" MS="Y">
Religion; and do think that the Ca&s;e in hand is
to be allow'd no le&s;s: and therefore wrote the
Enquiry with Two very hone&s;t De&s;igns; <HI>viz.</HI> To
&s;ee if by Strength of Argument I cou'd receive
Satisfaction; And to Explode, and, as far as in me
lies, to Oppo&s;e the Practice.</P>
<P>Secondly, Had your Book given me, or any
body el&s;e that I can meet with, <HI>who&s;e Judgment
is to be valued,</HI> the Satisfaction I de&s;ir'd; I a&s;&s;ure
you, I am &s;o little fond of an Opinion, becau&s;e it
is mine, that I &s;hou'd not have been a&s;ham'd to
have own'd my &s;elf mi&s;taken; and po&s;&s;ibly have
&s;hown as much Humiliay in Acknowledging it, as
you think I have Pride in Oppo&s;ing.</P>
<P>As to Per&s;onal Mi&s;carriages and Misfortunes, of
which no Man has more, and which, perhaps, may
weaken the Reputation of the Author, but I am
&s;ure ought not of my Argument: To them I
&s;hall only &s;ay, God <HI>in his Merciful Providence has
heal'd the La&s;t, and, I hope, has pardon'd the Fir&s;t:</HI>
And if &s;o, I am upon even Terms in point of
Rea&s;oning.</P>
<P>By this you may &s;ee I am &s;en&s;ible of the Beam
in my own Eye, and have for &s;ome years taken
up the part of a Penitent on that very account;
but did never under&s;tand that thereby I was barr'd
from Enquiring into what I judg'd Scandalous to
the Profe&s;&s;ion of a Party in General, of whom,
<HI>though unworthy,</HI> I was a Member.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="7" MS="Y">
Nor, Sir, am I any-where guilty of Judging
another, where the Ca&s;e is not &s;o plain, as that
it really &s;eems to &s;peak it &s;elf: For I mu&s;t remem|ber
al&s;o, that we are no more to call Good, Evil,
or Evil, Good, than we are to Judge one ano|ther.</P>
<P>Thus, Sir, I am gone over my own Character;
and &s;hall only demand this from you of Right,
That, &s;o far as Truth and Hone&s;ty is on my &s;ide,
it may not, nor ought not to be de&s;pis'd for
being u&s;her'd in by an unworthy In&s;trument.</P>
<P>And 'tis &s;trange, Sir, that you who Animadvert
upon me for Judging, &s;hould &s;o &s;everely judge
me, and that wrongfully too, as &s;hall appear in
the Particulars of this &s;hort Di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<P>I cou'd not be &s;atisfi'd to &s;ay le&s;s to this Point
on the&s;e Accounts, becau&s;e I mu&s;t put in a <HI>Caveat</HI>
again&s;t Per&s;onal Reflections as unfair in the Di&s;|pute:
He that plea&s;$s fir&s;t to Confute the Argu|ment,
is welcome to &s;how his Wit in Satyrizing
upon the Follies and Afflictions of the Author:
And there I leave it, and proceed to what I con|ceive
is your Third Mi&s;take about me.</P>
<P><HI>Viz.</HI> My Profe&s;&s;ion. And this you &s;eem to
make plain, while from the 13th, to the 24th Page,
you treat me as an Independent, and &s;pend your
Time to Reply to the particular Tenents in di&s;pute
between You and Them; which, with Submi&s;&s;ion,
I conceive to be nothing at all to the purpo&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="8" MS="Y">
After this, <HI>P.</HI> 30, 31, 32, I am talk'd with as a <HI>Fifth-Monarchy-man,</HI>
and a <HI>Leveller;</HI> what of the&s;e Prin|ciples
any-where appears in the Enquiry, I con|fe&s;s
I am at a lo&s;s to know; nor, Sir, have you been
&s;o kind to lay it down.</P>
<P>Indeed I own my &s;elf &s;omewhat &s;urpriz'd to
&s;ee you run on in An&s;wering the &s;crupulous Inde|pendent
about <HI>Kneeling at the Sacrament,</HI> and the
Extravagant <HI>Fifth-Monarchy-man,</HI> about &s;eizing the
Properties of Mankind for the U&s;e of the Saints;
and &s;uch things as the&s;e, by way of Reply to an
<HI>Enquiry about Occa&s;ional promi&s;cuous Conformity:</HI> and am
&s;till at a Lo&s;s to find an Antecedent to this Relative.</P>
<P>I a&s;&s;ure you I am no <HI>Independent,</HI> nor <HI>Fifth-Monar|chy-man,</HI>
nor <HI>Leveller.</HI> You have &s;hown your Learn|ing,
Sir, and Confuted an Error incon&s;i&s;tent with
Civil Society: Very well; but this had been bet|ter
done by it &s;elf; it had no more relation to the
Ca&s;e in hand, than a Lecture again&s;t the <HI>Alchoran;</HI>
and you might as well conjecture me to be a <HI>Ma|hometan,</HI>
as a <HI>Fifth-Monarchy-man,</HI> from any thing in
the Book that looks like either. But, Sir, &s;ince
I am led by you to give an account of my Pro|fe&s;&s;ion,
which, I hope, I &s;hall always be ready
to do; I &s;hall do it in few words: That I am
of the &s;ame Cla&s;s, and in the &s;ame Denomination
of a Di&s;&s;enter with your &s;elf, your Office excepted,
and am willing to be guided by, and to practi&s;e
the Great Rule of Chri&s;tian Charity in all the pro|per
<PB N="8" REF="9" MS="Y">
and legal Extents of it: Indeed I have more
need to practi&s;e it than you, becau&s;e I &s;tand more
in need of it from others, with re&s;pect to the Cau|&s;es
already nam'd. And however, by wre&s;ting
Words, and mi&s;taking my Intentions, you are plea|&s;ed
to &s;ee nothing of it; I am not yet convinc'd
that I have broken that Great Chri&s;tian Rule of
Charity, in any thing I have written.</P>
<P>I come now to the Fourth Thing in which you
are mi&s;taken, which is in my <HI>Intentions;</HI> in which
you ra&s;hly, and, I a&s;&s;ure you, wrongfully judge me,
however cautious you wou'd have me be of judging
others: But, Sir, <HI>Humanum eft Errare;</HI> you are no
more Infallible, I &s;ee, than I, and are fallen into
the &s;ame ra&s;h Error you Reprove me for with &s;o
much Severity; by judging, that the principal De|&s;ign
of this Book was to reflect upon a Worthy
Gentleman, who is nam'd in the Preface: And in
one place you are pleas'd to join me with the
Party who Oppos'd him, and bring me in making
my Court to them.</P>
<P>All the&s;e, Sir, I &s;hall make appear to be not
only Mi&s;takes, but groundle&s;s Mi&s;takes; &s;uch as
nothing but the &s;ame Thoughts which put you out
of Temper, cou'd lead you into: And I can &s;o|lemnly
Appeal in the Form you have &s;et down,
that you have wrong'd me in your Cen&s;ure.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, Sir, the <HI>Enquiry</HI> was publi&s;h'd Three years
ago, and therefore cou'd not be de&s;ign'd as a Per|&s;onal
<PB N="9" REF="10" MS="Y">
Invective again&s;t the Gentleman you &s;peak
of: All that can be &s;aid, is, That the Cau&s;e be|ing
again given, the Re-printing it was de&s;ign'd
as a Reproof to the Practice: and &s;o much I own.
As for <HI>Per&s;ons,</HI> I am indifferent; <HI>if the Coat fits any
body, let them wear it.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly, Sir, I declare my &s;elf, if of any Party,
I am, and ever was for the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Liberty, and
for the putting &s;uch Men into the Magi&s;tracy, who,
in Concurrence with the King, our Supreme Magi|&s;trate,
wou'd protect and pre&s;erve that Liberty.
And, as a Per&s;on every way qualified to execute a
Tru&s;t of &s;o much Honour, whether profitable or
not, I won't examine, I gave my Vote for Sir <HI>Thomas
Abney,</HI> and &s;hou'd ha' done &s;o, if I had the Power
of Ten Thou&s;and Voices; and no Man has more
Re&s;pect for, or Opinion of his Hone&s;ty and Ability
than my &s;elf: Nor have I, God be thank'd, any
Occa&s;ion to &s;ay this to flatter him; <HI>for I neither
want his Favour, nor fear his Anger.</HI></P>
<P>Herein therefore I pre&s;ume to &s;ay you have been
entirely mi&s;taken; and the&s;e Errors have led you
to wa&s;te your Time, and the Reader's too, in ma|king
needle&s;s Remarks, and An&s;wering tho&s;e peo|ple
who never Oppos'd you.</P>
<P>I come now to that part of your Book which re|&s;pects
the Ca&s;e in hand; which, as it is the lea&s;t
part, and indeed &s;eems to agree with the Title,
that it is only a <HI>Con&s;ideration</HI> of the Preface; <HI>for really,
<PB N="10" REF="11" MS="Y">
with &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, there is very little An&s;wer to the Fact:</HI>
So it requires not that I &s;hou'd Reply to the Argu|ment;
for I &s;ee none, but that drawing back the
Curtain which you have &s;pread over the Subject, I
&s;hou'd &s;et it in a True Light, that all Men may
judge by their own Con&s;ciences, and the Scripture-Rule,
and take care they be not di&s;tingui&s;h'd out
of their Rea&s;on and Religion by the Cunning and
Artifice of Words.</P>
<P>Plea&s;e therefore, Sir, to admit me to run over
your Book with as mode&s;t Animadver&s;ions as my
ju&s;t Defence will allow; and I am content to &s;tand
Corrected, where I fail in point of Decency.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, You quarrel with me for a &startq;<HI>Breach of Kind|ne&s;s
and Equity, in biding my own Name, and Reveal|ing
yours. De&s;igning my &s;elf to fight in the Dark, and
expecting you to do it in open Light.</HI>&endq; And you give
us Five whole Pages, including the Quotation of
your &s;elf in your Preface to the Inhabitants of <HI>Tor|rington,</HI>
to &s;how your Indifferency in Controverted
Di&s;putes, and con&s;equently your Unwillingne&s;s to
engage in this.</P>
<P>Truly, Sir, as to the Fir&s;t, I thought a publick
Appeal to you, who are a publick Per&s;on, had
been no Sin again&s;t Kindne&s;s or Equity; if it be,
I ask your Pardon.</P>
<P>As to my Concealing my Name, I have given
you my Rea&s;ons already; and as to my Expo&s;ing
yours, had you thought fit to have Replied to the
<PB N="11" REF="12" MS="Y">
Book which lay Three years unan&s;wer'd, without
being addre&s;s'd to any per&s;on in particular, you had
been at Liberty to have remain'd as unexpos'd as
the Author.</P>
<P>But the Enquiry being unan&s;wer'd, gave &s;ome
people more prejudice again&s;t the Integrity of Di&s;|&s;enters
in general, than I cou'd wi&s;h to have found;
upon which I thought it nece&s;&s;ary to have the Mat|ter
di&s;cu&s;s'd, if po&s;&s;ible; and knew no Man more
concern'd to do it, <HI>nor more capable than your
&s;elf.</HI></P>
<P>Nor is your An&s;wering me &s;uch a Di&s;appoint|ment
as you are pleas'd to mention; but that you
&s;hou'd attempt it, and do it to no more purpo&s;e,
is, I confe&s;s, more Di&s;appointment to me than
any thing I cou'd ha' met with.</P>
<P>Whether, Sir, the Indifferency you are &s;o pleas'd
with in your Temper, be Congruous to your Pro|fe&s;&s;ion
as a <HI>Go&s;pel Mini&s;ter,</HI> I &s;hall not examine:
Whether you that are Pa&s;tor of a Di&s;&s;enting-Church,
and Admini&s;ter the Ordinances of Chri&s;t
to a Select People, in a way Di&s;&s;enting from the
E&s;tabli&s;h'd Church, and thereby maintain a Schi&s;m
in the &s;aid E&s;tabli&s;h'd Church, ought to be &s;o indiffe|rent
as to boa&s;t that you never per&s;uaded any Man
to Conform, or not to Conform, I leave it to your
&s;elf to con&s;ider; I am &s;ure, if I was arriv'd to that
Coldne&s;s in the matter my &s;elf, I wou'd Conform
immediately; for I think what I affirm'd in the
<PB N="12" REF="13" MS="Y">
<HI>Enquiry,</HI> Page $word$. remains a Truth unan&s;wer'd by
you: &startq;<HI>That Schi&s;m from a True E&s;tabli&s;h'd Church
of Chri&s;t, is a great Sin; and if I can Conform, I ought
to Conform.</HI>&endq;</P>
<P>From this Declaration of your own Indifferency
to meddle in Matters of Controver&s;y, with your
Rea&s;ons for it, which I &s;uppo&s;e you wou'd have ta|ken
as Introductory to what follows, you are pleas'd
to proceed <HI>very angrily</HI> to examine why I engage you
in this quarrel: I have given you an account of it
already with all the hone&s;ty and plainne&s;s I can;
and I thought a per&s;on in your Place wou'd never
have Re&s;ented the being put upon the Defence of
his Profe&s;&s;ion, or being civilly ask'd a Que&s;tion
about it; and I cannot but ob&s;erve how carefully
you avoid, being engag'd in the pre&s;ent Di&s;pute.</P>
<P><HI>I ought to have been well a&s;&s;ur'd, you &s;ay,</HI>
(1.) That you did advi&s;e one way or the other; <HI>Or,</HI>
(2.) That you ought to have done &s;o.</P>
<P>Really, Sir, I think it immaterial whether you
<HI>were,</HI> or no; or, whether you <HI>ought,</HI> or no;
for I never Charg'd you with the fir&s;t, or affirm'd
the la&s;t; but only ask'd this fair Que&s;tion:</P>
<P>Whether it was allow'd by Di&s;&s;enters in general,
or by your Congregation in particular? To which
Que&s;tion you give no An&s;wer.</P>
<P>But I &s;hall an&s;wer you hone&s;tly and directly:
I am a&s;&s;ur'd, as far as Rationally I can be, by Con|&s;equences
of things, <HI>that you have not advi&s;ed one
<PB N="13" REF="14" MS="Y">
way or other:</HI> Nor do I affirm you ought to have
done &s;o, unle&s;s the per&s;on concern'd, applied to
you for Advice in point of Con&s;cience on the Ca&s;e;
if he did, I do not &s;ee how you could decline it.
&s;o that to me, it &s;eems, you either were oblig'd,
or not oblig'd, as the Application of the per&s;on
concern'd might alter the Ca&s;e; I do not &s;ay you
were oblig'd officiou&s;ly to tender your Advice in
the Ca&s;e: <HI>If I am wrong here, I &s;hall acknowledge my
Error when I am better inform'd.</HI></P>
<P>The next thing will come clo&s;e to the Point;
Whether it be a <HI>Fault,</HI> an <HI>unlawful Action,</HI> or no,
for a Di&s;&s;enter, <HI>as &s;uch,</HI> to hold Occa&s;ional Com|munion
with the E&s;tabli&s;h'd Church, and, at the
&s;ame time, continue in, or return to his Relative
Conjunction with a Separate Church?</P>
<P>That it is not a &s;in&s;ul Act &s;imply to have Com|munion
with the E&s;tabli&s;h'd Church, I willingly
agree. But &s;ince on this Point depends the Weight
of our pre&s;ent Di&s;pute, I mu&s;t conclude, That I
think 'tis a &s;in&s;ul Act Circum&s;tantially and Con|junctively.</P>
<P>And becau&s;e I wou'd be rightly under&s;tood, I
&s;hall endeavour to be Explicit, though I run the
hazard of being counted impertinent.</P>
<P>I have laid down the Ca&s;e, I thought, fairly,
and of which you are pleas'd to take no notice, in
the <HI>Enquiry,</HI> Page 12.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="15" MS="Y">
&startq;He who Di&s;&s;ents from an E&s;tabli&s;h'd Church from
any other Rea&s;ons but &s;uch as the&s;e; That he re|ally
believes the &s;aid E&s;tabli&s;h'd Church is not of the
pure&s;t In&s;titution, but that be can &s;erve God in a Form

his Duty to do it &s;o, and no otherwi&s;e: Such a one

<P>And thus, Sir, I am brought to my Argument
again: Of which I &s;hall give you this &s;hort Ab|&s;tract;
and you, or any body el&s;e, are welcome
to be angry with me, if you will be pleas'd fir&s;t
to An&s;wer it:</P>
<P>That he who Di&s;&s;ents from the E&s;tabli&s;h'd Church, ex|cept
from a true Principle of Con&s;cience, is guilty of a great
Sin.</P>
<P>That he who Conforms to the E&s;tabli&s;h'd Church again&s;t
his Con&s;cience, is guilty of a great Sin.</P>
<P>That he who both Di&s;&s;ents and Conforms at the &s;ame time
and in the &s;ame Point of Religion, mu&s;t be guilty of one
of the&s;e great Sins.</P>
<P>That he who has committed either of the&s;e Sins, ought
not to be receiv'd again on either &s;ide on any other Terms
than as a Penitent.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="16" MS="Y">
I do not examine, as I hinted then, whether
the Gentleman you would embroil me with, be
thus guilty; <HI>be that to him&s;elf.</HI></P>
<P>But I mu&s;t now come to your Di&s;tinctions:
Indeed, Sir, I believe as you &s;ay, that taking which
&s;ide you will, you may puzzle the mo&s;t of plain
people, who are but of ordinary Under&s;tandings in
the Controver&s;y about Ceremonies: And give me
leave to add, That &s;uch is the Subtilty and Nicety
of Sophi&s;tical Rea&s;onings, that Men may almo&s;t
Di&s;tingui&s;h them&s;elves into, and out of any Opini|on;
and &s;ome People, who are Ma&s;ters of the Art
of Nice Arguing, too often lo&s;e both Them&s;elves
and their Religion in the Labyrinths of Words:
<HI>School Divinity and Practical Chri&s;tianity are Two things,</HI>
and &s;eldom under&s;tood by the &s;ame Heads.</P>
<P>But, Sir, with the greate&s;t Re&s;pect, and &s;ome
Concern, let me tell you, I did not think to find
all the Difference between the Di&s;&s;enters and the
Church of <HI>England</HI> d windl'd into <HI>Three additional Ap|pendices,
in which we have &s;ome Difference, and &s;o:</HI> and
this from Mr. <HI>How,</HI> who is Pa&s;tor of a Separate
Church.</P>
<P>If we differ from them in Trifles, or have but
a Trifling Difference, I think we can never ju&s;tify
making &s;o large a Cha&s;m in the Church; we have
much to an&s;wer for, without que&s;tion, in the too
fatal Divi&s;ions of this Nation, if it has all been
occa&s;ion'd by a few &s;mall Appendices.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="17" MS="Y">
If our Differences are not Matters of Con&s;cience,
I have no more to &s;ay; if they are, 'tis a My&s;te|ry
yet hidden from the Common Under&s;tand|ings,
how they can be fir&s;t in&s;i&s;ted on from a
Principle of Con&s;cience, and then wav'd with|out
acting again&s;t that Con&s;cience, which only
could ju&s;tify the fir&s;t in&s;i&s;ting on them: If you
can Di&s;tingui&s;h us into this, I am mi&s;taken.</P>
<P>I allow your Di&s;tinctions of Sins, which are
Con&s;i&s;tent or Incon&s;i&s;tent with the Chri&s;tian State
to be Orthodox and Right.</P>
<P>I allow your Di&s;tinctions of Negative and Af|firmative
Precepts, and, according to my weak
Talent, agree with you in them.</P>
<P>But the Con&s;equence you draw, with &s;ubmi&s;&s;i|on,
does not reach the Ca&s;e; which is, That &s;cru|pulous
Per&s;ons ought to be fully per&s;uaded in their
own Minds; and Fellow-Chri&s;tians were not to
Judge, but to Receive them.</P>
<P>This you have an&s;wer'd your &s;elf, <HI>P.</HI> 13. to be
meant in dubious and &s;mall Matters: And if we
mu&s;t &s;tick here, we are next to Examine, Whether
the Difference between Us and the E&s;tabli&s;h'd
Church be only in dubious and &s;mall Matters; if
it be, I know not how we &s;hall Ward off the Blow
of being guilty of Schi&s;m; the Sin of which I &s;up|po&s;e
you will not di&s;pute. Wherefore to de&s;cend
to &s;ome Particulars&mdash;- If I know why we Di&s;&s;ent
<PB N="17" REF="18" MS="Y">
from the E&s;tabli&s;h'd Church, 'tis principally on &s;uch
accounts as the&s;e.</P>
<P>1. On account of the Epi&s;copal
<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="marg"><HI>Clark&s;on</HI>'s No-Scripture-Evidence for Dioce&s;an Bi&s;hops.</NOTE> Hierarchy, Prelatical Ordination
and Super-intendency.</P>
<P>2. On account of their impo&s;ing things own'd
to be indifferent, as Terms of Communion.</P>
<P>3. On account of their impo&s;ing things own'd
to be otherwi&s;e indifferent, as made nece&s;&s;ary by
the Command of the Civil Magi&s;trate.</P>
<P>As to Partial Conformity, Di&s;&s;enting in &s;ome
things, and Conforming in others, which you men|tion
<HI>Page.</HI> it does not &s;eem to concern this Ca&s;e.
No Man among the Di&s;&s;enters, I believe, pretend|ed
to Di&s;&s;ent in every thing; but we are &s;peaking
of Conforming in tho&s;e very Points in which we
Di&s;&s;ent, and that no le&s;s than the <HI>Article of Com|munion.</HI></P>
<P>If the&s;e are your &s;mall things, I am content to
&s;tand by it, and ready to prove, as I &s;aid in the
<HI>Enquiry:</HI></P>
<P>That whoever Separates from this Church, and
at the &s;ame time Conforms to it; by Conforming,
denies his Di&s;&s;ent being Lawful; or, by his Di&s;&s;ent|ing,
Damns his Conforming as Sinful.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="19" MS="Y">
All this, Sir, you have not thought fit to touch
upon, for Rea&s;ons which you know be&s;t; and I
really wonder you &s;hou'd take &s;o much pains to
Cavil at me and a &s;imple Preface, which really
was not worth your while; and when you have
led your &s;elf into the Argument, take no notice of
the thing it &s;elf, as it is Objected, but Di&s;tingui&s;h
&s;o nicely about the &s;maller matters, and omit the
greater.</P>
<P>If we differ from the E&s;tabli&s;h'd Church in &s;mall
things only, we are to blame to make the Breach &s;o
wide: Was it for &s;mall and dubious Things only
that we &s;uffer'd Proce&s;s of the Law, Excommuni|cations,
Seizures of our E&s;tates, and Impri&s;onment
of our Per&s;ons? And &s;ince you are pleas'd to bring
in that Honourable Gentleman, &s;peaking in the
fir&s;t Per&s;on to the Point, as an Inference drawn from
your Di&s;tinctions, and your &s;elf telling us what
be may perhaps do;</P>
<P>Give me leave to go through tho&s;e Suppo&s;ititi|ous
Ca&s;es with you, Sir. <HI>As to the particular Per&s;on,
you concern him in it, not I.</HI></P>
<P>1. <HI>You &s;ay,</HI> &startq;He may have Arguments &s;o &s;pecious, that
&s;uppo&s;ing he Err, may Impo&s;e upon the Judgment, and
thereby Direct the Practice of a very Intelligent, Di&s;|cerning,
and Upright-hearted Man, &s;o as to make him
think that which is perhaps an Error, his pre&s;ent Duty,
and &s;o not offer Violence to his Con&s;cience.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="20" MS="Y">
I An&s;wer: Admit he does &s;o; yet while you at
the &s;ame time allow <HI>he Errs,</HI> that is, Sins; why
ought not he to be admoni&s;hed to Repent of that
Sin, before he be receiv'd again into Communion?
This is what I mean by being receiv'd as a Peni|tent:
You grant (<HI>P.</HI> 9.) a Man is to do the part
of a Penitent for a Fault; and this Error is a Fault,
though it were an Error of Ignorance.</P>
<P>2. <HI>Then you &s;ay, P.</HI> 18. &startq;As judging &s;uch a Church
true as to E&s;&s;entials, he may think (Occa&s;ion inviting)
he hath greater Rea&s;on, though it be Defective in Acci|dents,
to Communicate with it &s;ometimes, than to &s;hun
its Communion always.&endq;</P>
<P>Pardon me, Sir, I mu&s;t &s;ay this &s;eems a Sophi&s;m
in Religion; for allow he may think &s;o, you mu&s;t
allow he ought not to think &s;o. And why <HI>Occa&s;ion
inviting?</HI> why not <HI>Occa&s;ion compelling?</HI> 'Tis mani|fe&s;t,
Force cou'd not <HI>compel,</HI> why &s;hou'd Occa&s;ion
<HI>invite?</HI></P>
<P>I confine not my Argument to this Gentleman;
but of Others I can prove, That Force cou'd not
<HI>compel</HI> them, but Occa&s;ion, that is, Honour and
Preferment cou'd <HI>invite</HI> them. Now if you plea&s;e
to Reconcile this for me, I &s;hall be gotten over one
Point; Whether a Man can ju&s;tify &s;uffering to the
Ruin, perhaps of his Family, rather than com$ly
with that which he may do without impo&s;ing upon
his Con&s;cience, and which, Occa&s;ion inviting, he
may judge lawful?</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="21" MS="Y">
You have another Di&s;tinction which, I confe&s;s,
I hardly think to be Rational, that is, Unprofitable
Preferment, <HI>Page $word$.</HI> Fir&s;t, I neither understand
that the In&s;tance you are upon is Unprofitable, nor
believe it; nor that the Epethite can be proper to
the word; for that which is Unprofitable, cannot
be a Preferment.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t al&s;o ob&s;erve here, Sir, that the Conformi|ty
exacted in the late Reigns, was not &s;o large as
what the&s;e Gentlemen are pleas'd to comply with
voluntarily. Now as to the Ceremonies you in|&s;i&s;t
on, and which indeed I do not, as the way of
Admini&s;tration, Kneeling, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> it was allow'd to
be &s;o indifferent then, that many receiv'd in the
Church Standing. But when the&s;e <HI>Unprofitable Pre|ferments,</HI>
as you plea&s;e to call them, invite, they
&s;eek of them&s;elves what before they cou'd not be
forc'd to.</P>
<P>3. <HI>You ask us another Que&s;tion:</HI> &startq;What if &s;ome
have thought that alone a &s;ufficient Rea&s;on for their
Occa&s;ional Communion with a Church, with whom they
have not con&s;tant Communion, That they may te&s;tify to
the World they Decline it not as no Church, but &s;o far
practically own it as the Rea&s;on of the thing requires;
may they not be &s;uppo&s;ed to do this, as thinking it a
good Rea&s;on, whether it be &s;o or no, without going again&s;t
Con&s;cience herein?&endq;</P>
<P>Truly, Sir, I mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e the&s;e <HI>It may be's,</HI> and
<HI>Why may not's,</HI> are put in to make out what you &s;aid
<PB N="21" REF="22" MS="Y">
<HI>Page $word$.</HI> that you cou'd puzzle a mean Under&s;tand|ing
both ways; and, I thank God, you are driven
to the Nece&s;&s;ity of the&s;e Arts. But to let you &s;ee
the&s;e Suppo&s;itions may be replied to;</P>
<P>1. Sir, the Church of <HI>England</HI> however, mu&s;t
own Her &s;elf very much oblig'd to &s;uch Gentlemen
who will Conform only to Vindicate her Reputa|tion.</P>
<P>2. They may be &s;uppo&s;ed to do thus, but they
cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed to do &s;o without a manife&s;t
gro&s;s Ignorance, and taking that for a good Rea&s;on
which is none at all: For if, Sir, you will admit
that a Man is in the Right as to him&s;elf, while he
thinks he is &s;o, then you open the way to the fatal
Latitude of all manner of Error; for no Man is
guilty of an Error, as an Error, but as his Judg|ment
may be perverted to believe him&s;elf right,
when he is wrong.</P>
<P>Page 19. <HI>you are pleas'd to Object for me:</HI>
&startq;Since, Sir, you think it not unlawful to Communicate
with &s;uch a Church &s;ometimes, why &s;hou'd you not (for
Common Order-&s;ake) do it always?&endq;</P>
<P>Sir, if you plea&s;e to give me leave to ask Que|&s;tions
for my &s;elf, I wou'd &s;tate it &s;omething more
fairly to the Ca&s;e in hand, thus: <HI>Since, Sir, you
think it not Unlawful to Communicate with &s;uch
a Church &s;ometimes, why &s;hou'd you not, to avoid
the ju&s;t Imputation of Schi&s;m, which is a great
Sin, have done it always?</HI> And why never do
<PB N="22" REF="23" MS="Y">
it, but when upon an Occa&s;ion of Preferment
inviting, you find it nece&s;&s;ary to protect you from
the Penalty of the Law?</P>
<P>I &s;hou'd ha' been very glad you had &s;tated this
Que&s;tion fully, and &s;uppo&s;e what An&s;wer you
plea&s;e; for, <HI>upon my word, I can &s;uppo&s;e none,</HI>
unle&s;s I wou'd bring him in, owning the Crime,
and repenting of it; which I &s;hou'd be glad to,
hear of.</P>
<P>What you &s;ay, I &s;hall &s;tare at, Page 20. &startq;<HI>I wil|lingly
admit, that what is &s;imply be&s;t, may not be be&s;t for
Practice in pre&s;ent Circum&s;tances.</HI>&endq; And I mu&s;t like|wi&s;e
re-mind you, Sir, That what may be &s;imply
Lawful, may be unlawful Circum&s;tantially: And
&s;o I affirm this to be, and dare undertake to prove
it &s;o, without coming into the Number of <HI>Solomon</HI>'s
Fools, with whom you have rank'd me for <HI>propo|&s;ing
ha&s;tily beyond Seven Men that can render a Rea&s;on.</HI></P>
<P>Here, Sir, <HI>viz.</HI> at your 20th Page; I mu&s;t leave
you to Combat with the <HI>Independents;</HI> and let them
an&s;wer for them&s;elves; I am not at all concern'd
in the Quarrel.</P>
<P>And you &s;pend three or four Pages as an Advo|cate
for the Church of <HI>England,</HI> concerning Modes
and Ge&s;tures; in which, I am &s;ure, I am far from
placing the lea&s;t Weight, where &s;erious Chri&s;tianity
is to be found; and God forbid either you or I, Sir,
&s;hou'd be found making a Rent in the Chri&s;tian
Union of this Church and Nation, if their Kneel|ing
<PB N="23" REF="24" MS="Y">
at the Sacrament, or the U&s;e of a Liturgy, were
all the Di&s;pute; 'tis you have led me into &s;aying
any thing of the Difference between the National
Church and the Di&s;&s;enters.</P>
<P>I know that the <GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> of the Primitive Church
included the Forms of their Admini&s;trations and
Publick Services; and need not recite my Autho|rities
for it to you, who know it better than I;
nor that they are found in the Time of <HI>Tertullian,</HI>
and long before him. But I know al&s;o, and the
contrary has never been prov'd, that tho&s;e Forms
were not impos'd as Terms of Communion, and
under the Penalty of Laws, at lea&s;t till the Divi|&s;ion
of the Church between the <HI>Arians</HI> and the
Orthodox, when Error and Per&s;ecution got into
the Church, and the Evil Spirit reign'd, to the De|&s;truction
of both &s;ides.</P>
<P>And now, Sir, I find you no more talking to
me till you come to <HI>Page</HI> 25. where you are plea|&s;ed
to Satyrize upon my Title and Preface.</P>
<P>Really, Sir, I believe my &s;elf capable to Defend
my Book again&s;t all that the Power of Cavil and
Sophi&s;try can &s;ugge&s;t; and therefore I am not &s;o|licitous
for my Preface and Title-page.</P>
<P>But that I may &s;atisfy your Reque&s;t; and tel|ling
you fir&s;t, that-you oblige me to it: I &s;hall
be plain.</P>
<P>&startq;You de&s;ire me to examine my own heart, what I
meant by that &s;ugge&s;tion? In Ca&s;es of Preferment,
<PB N="24" REF="25" MS="Y">
mentioned in the Title; was it not to In&s;inuate, that Pre|ferment
was the Inducement to that Worthy Per&s;on to
act agai&s;t his Con&s;cience?&endq;</P>
<P>Sir, Will you be plea&s;ed to <HI>Examin&eacute; your own Rea|&s;on,</HI>
how that can be, when the Words were print|ed
Three years before the Fact; and I appeal to
God and the World, whether you have not wrong|fully
Judg'd me then. But to make it more plain:</P>
<P>I do not &s;ay he, or any body el&s;e, does it for Pre|ferment;
<HI>you are pleas'd &s;trangely to mi&s;take me:</HI> I &s;ay,
they may have the Preferment without it.</P>
<P>'Tis done to &s;ave their Money, to &s;ave the Five
hundred Pounds, which is the Penalty of the Act:
I am &s;orry you have not read the Book before you
ventur'd to make &s;o &s;evere a Remark. For your bet|ter
Information therefore, Sir, I refer you to <HI>P.</HI> 19.
in the <HI>Enquiry,</HI> where my Words are plain.</P>
<P>As to the Worthy Gentleman, <HI>who&s;e Cau&s;e you would
have this to be;</HI> you &s;ay this has been his known
Judgment and Practice &s;everal years.</P>
<P>Tho' it were true, yet, Sir, this is no Argument
to prove the thing lawful or to prove that it is not
practi&s;ed, even in every part that I have laid down,
by others before him, and like to be &s;o after him;
it only quits him of doing it again&s;t his Con&s;cience,
to qualify him&s;elf for the unprofitable Preferment
you mention: <HI>and this I never Charg'd him with.</HI></P>
<P>That he has done the Fact, no body Di&s;putes;
but that he did it again&s;t his Con&s;cience, I never
<PB N="25" REF="26" MS="Y">
alledg'd; <HI>you put that upon me, Sir, unju&s;tly:</HI> Be
his Con&s;cience to God and him&s;elf, I know better
than to judge him, nor can you without a Breach
of Charity &s;ugge&s;t it of me.</P>
<P>Nor do I any-where &s;ay that others have
acted again&s;t their Con&s;ciences that do &s;o; po&s;&s;i|bly
they may, by the help of <HI>nice Di&s;tingui&s;hing,</HI>
Rea&s;on them&s;elves into a Belief of their being in
the Right.</P>
<P>But the Point in Debate is, Whether, <HI>whatever
their Opinions may be in the Ca&s;e,</HI> the Act it &s;elf
be not, as I have &s;aid, Circum&s;tantially &s;inful:
For I hope you will grant me they are never the
more in the Right for its being their Opinion;
Truth is always unmov'd, &s;ullen, and the &s;ame,
whatever Glo&s;s our Fancy or Intere&s;t puts upon it.</P>
<P>But &s;ince you will have it be this Gentleman's
practice, which I think no Reputation to him, nor
Defence of the Practice: Nor do I think you or
he can ju&s;tify your Di&s;&s;enting from the Church of
<HI>England,</HI> and that Practice together: Since, I
&s;ay, you will have it be that Gentleman's practice;
all you gain by that in point of Argument, is, That
he did not do it again&s;t his Con&s;cience, nor to
&s;erve the pre&s;ent Turn. And what then? I affirm
to you, I neither meant him, nor any Man el&s;e,
but him that is Guilty; and I meant him, and eve|ry
body el&s;e, if they are guilty. And what is all
this to the purpo&s;e? The Que&s;tion is not here,
<PB N="26" REF="27" MS="Y">
Who is, or is not guilty of it; but whether the
thing in its own Nature, aggravated with the Cir|cum&s;tances
of Turn and Return, timed for Pre|ferment,
with all the black <HI>Et cetera's</HI> of it, as 'tis
lately practic'd, and as I have laid it down, be a
Crime, or no?</P>
<P>If this Gentleman you <HI>would Embroil me with,</HI> did
formerly live in a general, or ordinary Communion,
both with the Church of <HI>England,</HI> and a private Con|gregation,
before either the Preferments I mention
invited, or the Penalty of the Law forced him to
it; Then he &s;tands clear of this part of the Charge,
That he did it for the Protection of his Intere&s;t;
but &s;till the Matter of Fact is true.</P>
<P>Thus, Sir, I have &s;aid what I thought my &s;elf
oblig'd to by way of Reply to your Con&s;iderations:
And as to your &s;evere Cen&s;ures, tho' I have a great
Opinion of your Charity, however you &s;eem to
be out of Temper in this Ca&s;e; yet I appeal from
your Judgment, to the Judgment of Truth; and
waving all your puzzling Di&s;tinctions, which my
Re&s;pect for your Per&s;on and Character, will not
permit me to De&s;cant upon; give me leave to
make this &s;hort Conclu&s;ion.</P>
<P>Sincerity is the Glory of a Chri&s;tian; the Native
Lu&s;tre of an hone&s;t Heart is impo&s;&s;ible to be hid;
'twill &s;hine through all his Life in one Action or
another, in &s;pite of Scandal; and it wants no Arti|fice

If the Practice we Di&s;cour&s;e of be to be Defend|ed,
<HI>let it be a Practice;</HI> I mean, let it be Volun|tary,
let it be Free and Spontaneous; and if Gentle|men,
who have &s;uch a Latitude in their Opinions,
wou'd not have it thought they are mov'd to it by
their Intere&s;ts, let them practice it openly, and not
Time it &s;o to the very <HI>Eve</HI> of an Election, as to
have it &s;peak of it &s;elf, and, as it were, force Men
to believe it done on purpo&s;e; nay, let them not

as to have it &s;poken in Contempt, with Cir|cum&s;tances
that &s;top the Mouths of Argument, and

Religion is not a thing, the Forms whereof are
of &s;uch Indifference, as you &s;eem to make it; that
'tis not a light thing to &s;hift and change Commu|nion
with an E&s;tabli&s;h'd, and with a Separate

before he was Cho&s;en?</HI> Or, whether any thing el&s;e you
Cen&s;oriou&s;ly Charge me with be true, or no, &s;eems
to me not worth your while to Examine? Since if
I &s;hou'd grant them all, the Argument of Occa&s;io|nal
Conformity remains untouch'd.</P>
<P>If the Truth be made the wor&s;e for my Temper,
I am &s;orry for it: But this is another of Mr. <HI>How</HI>'s
Paradoxes, <HI>and &s;omething like your Unprofitable
Preferment,</HI> that Truth, tho' it be mix'd with the
wor&s;t Temper in the World, &s;hou'd thereby be &s;o
deba&s;ed, as to become wor&s;e than Error.</P>
<P>Sir, I had ended here, but for a Clau&s;e you force
me to Reply to, concerning the Old <HI>Puritans,</HI> who
you tax me with abu&s;ing: Indeed 'twas as remote
from my Thoughts, as 'twas, that ever it was po&s;&s;i|ble
you cou'd treat an Adver&s;ary with &s;uch Lan|guage.</P>
<P>And, but that I &s;hall not &s;uffer my &s;elf to be
tran&s;ported beyond the Bounds of Civility, and &s;o
fall into your Error, I could allow my &s;elf to be
very much mov'd, That &s;uch a Man as you &s;hould
venture to Charge me with what is neither true in
Fact, nor can be &s;ugge&s;ted by Con&s;equence from
any thing I have wrote: And, Sir, you mu&s;t give
<PB N="29" REF="30" MS="Y">
me leave to &s;ay, I am &s;orry you &s;hou'd lay your &s;elf
&s;o open, and force me to &s;o &s;evere a Remark.</P>
<P>You are pleas'd to affirm, That I indu&s;triou&s;ly
repre&s;ent the Primitive <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Puritans, as if they
were generally of my <HI>&s;tingy, narrow</HI> Spirit.</P>
<P>And here you run upon me with ill Language,
<HI>How I could think to Impo&s;e upon the World in a matter of
&s;o recent Memory;</HI> and, <HI>How I could have the Confi|dence,</HI>
&amp;c. This is really a new &s;ort of Stile from
Mr. <HI>How.</HI></P>
<P>Sir, I have indu&s;triou&s;ly examin'd the Book I wrote;
and, as I am &s;ure I never entertain'd a Thought
in prejudice of the beft Character which can be gi|ven
tho&s;e Primitive Reformers; &s;o I cannot find one
word in the whole Book which can, no, not with
the help of an <HI>Inuendo,</HI> be &s;o much as pretended
to look that way.</P>
<P>Wherefore, Sir, unle&s;s you can make it out, or,
by the help of &s;ome of your Di&s;tinctions, come off
from it; I hope you will do me &s;o much Ju&s;tice, as
you are a Man of Truth and Hone&s;ty, to recant the
Scandal, and acknowledge your &s;elf mi&s;taken.</P>
<P>And that I may leave it to every body to judge,
whether I have not ju&s;t Ground for what I &s;ay; I
&s;hall qaote here all that I have &s;aid relating to the
<HI>Puritans,</HI> and impartially lay down the Matter of
Fact.</P>
<P>After I had given a &s;hort Abridgment of our
Reformation, and Recited the Controver&s;y be|tween
<PB N="30" REF="31" MS="Y">
Bi&s;hop <HI>Ridley</HI> and Bi&s;hop <HI>Hooper,</HI> I pro|ceeded
thus, Page the 6th. &startq;<HI>When Queen</HI> Eliza|beth
<HI>Re&s;tored the Prote&s;tant Religion, and the Church
enjoy'd its Peace again, the Debate reviv'd: But the
fir&s;t E&s;tabli&s;hment of King</HI> Edward, <HI>obtain'd &s;o on
the Minds of Men, that the farther Reformation was
rejected: The other Party being not at all Convinc'd,
tho' Over rul'd, &s;ubmitted their Per&s;ons to the Laws,
but not their Opinions; affirming, That it was the Duty
of every Chri&s;tian to endeavour to &s;erve God with the
greate&s;t Purity of Wor&s;hip as was po&s;&s;ible; and that
this was the pure&s;t Wor&s;hip which came neare&s;t the Di|vine
In&s;titution, which they believed the E&s;tabli&s;h'd
Liturgy did not; and therefore in Con&s;cience they
mu&s;t be Di&s;&s;enters.&endq;</HI></P>
<P>Having made this Quotation, which I have
&s;ufficient Authotity to prove genuine, from a Ma|nu&s;cript
of a famous Man in tho&s;e days, which
I have &s;een, and on occa&s;ion am ready to pro|duce;
I go on thus:</P>
<P>&startq;<HI>It mu&s;t be own'd, that the Original Authors of the&s;e
Di&s;putes were Learned, Devout, and Singularly Pious,
&s;trict in Conver&s;ation to Exce&s;s,</HI> if that were po&s;&s;i|ble;
<HI>and from thence, in a &s;ort of happy Deri&s;ion, were
call'd</HI> Puritans: <HI>Of whom I &s;hall &s;ay nothing, but leave
for a Record the la&s;t Speech of a famous Foreigner;</HI>&endq;</P>
<P>Sit anima mea, cum Puritannis Anglicanis.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="32" MS="Y">
This is all the Words that have the lea&s;t Retro|&s;pect
on the <HI>Puritans;</HI> unle&s;s you will pretend
that a few words, <HI>Page</HI> 24. is meant of them,
which no Man can have any Colour of Rea&s;on
for: But le&s;t that &s;hou'd be pretended, I &s;hall quote
them al&s;o, <HI>Page</HI> 24.</P>
<P>&startq;The Di&s;&s;enters can never pretend to be Di&s;&s;enters
upon the meer Principle of Purity of Wor&s;hip, as I have
related in the beginning of this Di&s;cour&s;e; if &s;uch &s;hall
be receiv'd as blamele&s;s into their Communion, who have
De&s;erted them upon occa&s;ion of Preferment.&endq;</P>
<P>This refers back to <HI>Page</HI> 12. where, I &s;ay, I &s;hall
give my E&s;&s;ay as to what I under&s;tand a real Di&s;|&s;enting
Prote&s;tant is; not can it refer to any other
place: But <HI>if you &s;hou'd &s;till &s;ay</HI> it looks back to the
<HI>Puritans,</HI> 'twou'd puzzle a better Head than mine
to find out a Reflection on them in it.</P>
<P>But this is not the only thing in which you are
pleas'd to injure both me and the Truth: For,
<HI>Page</HI> 28. you tell me with &s;ome Heat too, &startq;<HI>That
throughout my Book, &s;uch as are not &s;o &s;tingily</HI> (your
Favourite-word, Sir) <HI>bigotted to a Party,</HI> as I,
are treated with this &s;ort of Charity, to be &s;til'd
<HI>Painted Hypocrites, &s;uch as play Bo-peep with God Al|mighty;
That if &s;uch an Occa&s;ion offer it &s;elf to any
of them to &s;erve God and their Country in a publick
Station; do what the Law requires, and which they
think they may &s;inle&s;ly do in order to it; do tre&s;pa&s;s
upon their Con&s;ciences, and Damn their Souls to &s;ave
their Countries.</HI>&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="33" MS="Y">
Sir, <HI>for God-&s;ake,</HI> how came you to let your Pa&s;|&s;ion
thus out-run your Memory?</P>
<P>There is not one word of all this true; <HI>pardon
me that I am oblig'd in my own Defence to &s;ay &s;o;</HI>
I refer you to the Original to convince your
&s;elf of it, and I'll take the pains to go along with
you in the Examination.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, As to <HI>painted Hypocrites,</HI> 'tis &s;poken of the
whole Body of Prote&s;tants in <HI>England, in haec Verba.</HI></P>
<P>P. 8. &startq;<HI>I mu&s;t acknowledge it fares with the Church of</HI>
England, <HI>and with Di&s;&s;enters both, as it has always
far'd with Chri&s;t's Church in the whole World; that
while &s;uppre&s;s'd and per&s;ecuted, their Profe&s;&s;ors were
few, and their Profe&s;&s;ion more &s;evere: But when Re|ligion
comes to be the Mode of a Country,</HI> &s;o many
painted Hypocrites, there's the word, <HI>get into
the Church, that Guile is not to be &s;een till it arrive to
Apo&s;tacy.</HI>&endq;</P>
<P>Pray, Sir, who can the&s;e <HI>painted Hypocrites</HI> refer
to, that you &s;hould &s;ay, <HI>Inuendo, All tho&s;e that are
not of my Party, or that are not &s;o &s;tingy as I?</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e painted Hypocrites mu&s;t belong to that
Religion which is the Mode of the Country; which
mu&s;t rather mean the Church of <HI>England</HI> than the
Di&s;&s;enters; and yet if I meant either of them, it
cannot be made a Reflection, becau&s;e 'tis confin'd
only to &s;uch as are Apo&s;tates from Religion, not &s;uch
as continue to Conform to both or either of them.</P>
<P>This is Judging me indeed neither with Charity
nor Truth: The next Words are, <HI>Such as play Bo|peep
<PB N="33" REF="34" MS="Y">
with God Almighty.</HI> Pray, good Sir, reflect on
<HI>Solomon,</HI> and what is &s;aid of &s;uch as judge of a Mat|ter
before they hear it: I am per&s;uaded you did not
read the Clau&s;e; which is thus:</P>
<P>I had been Examining the woful Excu&s;e of &s;ome
people, and <HI>too many &s;uch we had,</HI> who wou'd take
the Sacrament at the Church, and pretend 'twas done
only as a Civil Action; on which I made &s;uch Re|marks
as, I think, &s;o prophane a Practice de&s;erv'd;
and at la&s;t added, <HI>This is playing Bo-peep with God Al|mighty.</HI></P>
<P>And, pray Sir, if I may be &s;o free with you, do
but examine the Circum&s;tance as I have laid it
down, and tell me from the Sincerity of your Soul,
<HI>if you are not of the &s;ame mind.</HI></P>
<P>The other Reflection is on &s;uch, who, tho' it be
again&s;t their Con&s;ciences, pretend 'tis to &s;erve their
Country: Of the&s;e, I &s;ay, &startq;<HI>They are Patriots indeed,
who will Damn their Souls to &s;ave their Country:</HI>&endq;
Not that thereby I imply, that to take the Sacra|ment
with the Church of <HI>England,</HI> wou'd Damn any
man's Soul, if he Communicated with a right Prin|ciple;
but to do it to &s;erve a Turn, which is the
Que&s;tion in hand, I won't an&s;wer for, tho 'it were
Inverted from the Church to a Di&s;&s;enting Congre|gation.</P>
<P>All the&s;e In&s;tances, Sir, and more which I could
reckon up, &s;erve to make me admire wherein I have
&s;o provok'd you, as to remove you from your wont|ed
Candor: And &s;ince my Writing on a Cau&s;e,
<PB N="34" REF="35">
which I expected fairer Quarter in, &s;o Exceedingly
moves you, I &s;hall chu&s;e rather to lay down the
Controver&s;y, than to Engage with a per&s;on, who,
I &s;hou'd be very much concern'd to &s;ee exceed the
Rules which he has with &s;o much Succe&s;s, and with
&s;o much Applau&s;e pre&s;crib'd to others.</P>
<P>I always thought Men might Di&s;pute without
Railing, and Differ without Quarrelling; and that
Opinions need not affect our Tempers: But &s;ince it
is not to be found, I leave it to tho&s;e who have a
better Talent that way than I.</P>
