<HEAD>A TREATISE, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>IT &s;eems &s;trange to me, that in a Country where Theatrical Repre&s;entations are &s;o much admired, and both Kinds of the Drama carried to &s;o great a Perfection, the Bu&s;ine&s;s of the Stage &s;hould be &s;o little un|der&s;tood.</P>
<P>Upon the lea&s;t favourable Calculation, the Number of tho&s;e called Play-Followers, can|not be rated at le&s;s than twelve thou&s;and in this Metropolis, and yet were I to allow the four and twentieth Part of the&s;e, a Capacity of determining on the Excellence, or Imper|fections of a Performance, or a Performer, I am &s;atisfied I &s;hould do the Public more than Ju&s;tice.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="3">
Nor is this Judgment the Re&s;ult of Spleen or Prejudice, but founded on a Combination of Facts, which cannot have e&s;caped the Ob|&s;ervation of tho&s;e, who are not either cur&s;ed with Ignorance, or blinded by Partiality.</P>
<P>I have &s;een an excellent Actor, who&s;e Form, perhaps, has not been extremely de|licate, or the Di&s;po&s;ition of his Features plea&s;ing, regarded by the Spectators with idle Eyes;
<Q><L>Thinking his Prattle to be tedious.</L></Q>
Whil&s;t another Performer, who from &s;ome lucky Circum&s;tance at his &s;etting out, has ac|quir'd the Favour of the Public, after mi&s;tak|ing a Sentiment of <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI>'s, made his Exit with a louder Plaudit, than is given to <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> at his Entrance. Nor does the Madne&s;s end here, for when this Nonpareil, this Phoenix of the Imagination has been puffed as high as the Breath of Popularity can blow him,&mdash;why then his Friends, apprehen&s;ive that their little Hero's airy Ca&s;tle will have a Tumble, from a Con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of the Weak|ne&s;s of its Foundation, endeavour to prop it by a collateral Pillar; and now, for&s;ooth, he is to commence Poet, he who has given &s;o many In&s;tances of his Ta&s;te and Judg|ment for the be&s;t Writers mu&s;t be able to compo&s;e admirably him&s;elf; wrought upon by the&s;e Adulations, the Pen is drawn, <HI>Mo|liere, Dancour, Le Sage</HI> be&s;ieg'd, their Works ravaged, a Plot and Characters car|ried

off in Triumph, and after about two Months tran&s;lating, vamping, altering, turn|ing Ver&s;e into Pro&s;e, and Pro&s;e into Ver&s;e, out comes the flim&s;y Piece, but no more like its Fathers than I am to <HI>Hercules.</HI> No matter for that tho', he is a great Actor, and mu&s;t be of con&s;equence a great Writer; pri|vate A&s;&s;urance has been before given that &s;uch a Thing is on the Anvil, that my Lord&mdash;, and Dr.&mdash;, and Mr.&mdash;have &s;een it, and pro|nounce it great; thus the Town is prepared, and up flies the Curtain, there may be &s;een the poor deluded Audience with lack-lu&s;tre Eyes gazing at their <HI>Ro&s;cius,</HI> applauding as heartily, as if <HI>Nero</HI> was the Performer, and Death was to be the con&s;equence of Di&s;like; at la&s;t we are di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, with an Invitation to the &s;ame Soop-Meagre Repa&s;t the &s;uc|ceeding Night, all of us in Raptures; I had the Luck to be po&s;ted in the Rear of a reverend and grea&s;y Doctor, who&s;e Belches of Applau&s;es at the Moral would have cer|tainly put (in <HI>Fribble</HI>'s Phra&s;e) a Period to my Exi&s;tence, had not I met with Relief from the fragrant Whi&s;pers of &s;ome of the &s;ofter Sex in the Boxes behind me, who&s;e Ob&s;ervations, (to do them Ju&s;tice) were at lea&s;t as wi&s;e as the Par&s;on's before me.</P>
<P><Q>&startq;Well, Mi&s;s, how do ye like it? Oh! extravagantly: Lord, he is the comicalle&s;t Creature; I thought I &s;hould have died with laughing: I vow I was quite a|&s;ham'd.&endq;</Q>&mdash;

<HI>John</HI> with the Chair puts an End to the li&s;ping Prattle of the pretty Igno|rant. Home they fly with a flaming Ac|count to Madam; Madam tells my Lady; my Lady, my Lord; my Lord, the ***; and &s;o bounce they all croud to the new Farce, where I &s;hall leave them with this trite Re|flection.</P>
<Q><L>Qui vult decipi, decipiatur.</L></Q>
<P>And here I am apprehen&s;ive lea&s;t the Ill|nature and Malice of the World &s;hould ap|ply the above Picture, from a di&s;tant Like|ne&s;s in &s;ome incon&s;iderable Feature to an ad|mired Dramatick Genius, who now re&s;ides in the Navel of this Metropolis. Oh fye! no &s;uch thing; by the Theology of the <HI>Hot|tentots</HI> I &s;wear 'tis no &s;uch Matter: Alack-a-day, the Man I mean was dead before the other was born; he was indeed once a bright Star that held his Place on high: But, re&s;t his Soul, he has not been one of us the&s;e thirty years.</P>
<P>But effectually to de&s;troy the Appearance of any Analogy between the two Gentle|men, and at the &s;ame time do Ju&s;tice to the Character of the afore&s;aid Dramatick Genius, who&s;e Reputation has been villainou&s;ly tra|duced by &s;ome evil-minded People, I &s;hall &s;et the World right with regard to a cruel
<PB N="7" REF="6">
Mi&s;take that it has eagerly adopted for this Month pa&s;t.</P>
<P>It has been proclaimed at Market-Cro&s;&s;es, and indu&s;triou&s;ly whi&s;pered, even in Churches, that Mr. <HI>G.</HI> was the Author of a paltry Farce, lately exhibited, call'd, <HI>Mi&s;s in her Teens.</HI> Oh! nothing &s;o fal&s;e; for not to mention how improbable it is, that &s;o judicious, correct, and lively a Genius would produce &s;o contemptible and mi&s;era|ble a Work, I happen to be in the Secret, and can trace the Ri&s;e and Progre&s;s of the Farce.</P>
<P>The Original came over, accompanied by a Kitt, in the interior Pocket of a Refugee from <HI>Rochelle.</HI> This Gentleman, by an In|vitation from the Mayor and Magi&s;trates of <HI>Sutton Cowfield juxta Litchfield,</HI> has long rejoic'd in the double Vocation of in&s;tructing the Ma&s;ters and Mi&s;&s;es of that Corporation in the Arts of &s;peaking <HI>French,</HI> and handling their Legs; his lei&s;ure Hours, in order to perfect him&s;elf in our Language, were em|ploy'd in tran&s;lating the <HI>Pari&s;iene</HI> of <HI>Dancour.</HI> The Par&s;on of the Pari&s;h hap|pened to get a View of the Work, and thinking our Hero an extraordinary Genius in the rapid Acqui&s;ition of Tongues, tran&s;|mitted the Piece to the Head of St. <HI>M&mdash;y-H&mdash;ll, O&mdash;d.</HI> Dr. <HI>K&mdash;g</HI> knowing it would &s;uit the Ta&s;te and Genius of the B&mdash;p of <HI>L&mdash;ff,</HI> inclos'd it to that reverend P&mdash;e.
<PB N="8" REF="7">
The B&mdash;p was infinitely pleas'd with the Moral and Matter, but a little puzzled as to the Poetry: <HI>S&mdash;n D-k</HI>'s Judgment was called in to determine that Point, who happen|ing to &s;hew it to his Patrone&s;s my Lady <HI>T</HI>&mdash;, &s;he being a Critick in this way, ima|gined, that the Characters a little heightened would hit the Gu&s;to of an Engli&s;h Audi|ence; and in order to do the Piece as much Ju&s;tice as po&s;&s;ible, a&s;&s;ign'd the Care of the different Parts to different Genius's. To Mr. <HI>Ru&s;&s;el</HI> &s;he committed the comical ones, &s;uch as <HI>Fribble</HI> and <HI>Fla&s;h;</HI> the Tragical, &s;uch as Mi&s;s and her Father, and indeed all the other Per&s;onages of the Drama, to the Conduct of <HI>S&mdash;n D&mdash;k.</HI> How far this Triumvirate, this <HI>Augu&s;tus, Lepidus,</HI> and <HI>Anthony</HI> of the Republick of Letters, have &s;ucceeded in their Attempt, I &s;ubmit to the Judgment of eighteen different Audi|ences; different I call them, for I have &s;till &s;o much Charity for the publick Ta&s;te as to &s;uppo&s;e, that no one Man has &s;een the Farce twice.</P>
<P>Thus much for Preface, and now for the ge|neral De&s;ign of this Treati&s;e, which is merely calculated to open the Eyes of the Injudicious, and by tracing the Ri&s;e and Progre&s;s of the Pa&s;&s;ions, together with their Effects on the Or|gans of our Bodies, enable them to judge how far the Imitation of tho&s;e Pa&s;&s;ions on the Stage be natural, and give them not only an Oppor|tunity
<PB N="9" REF="8">
of being rationally plea&s;ed, but of communicating to others, why they are &s;o.</P>
<P>I have often heard complaints, and that from Men of allowed Under&s;tanding, that their Knowledge was a Burthen to them, that they were never half &s;o happy, as when every Trifle gave them Plea&s;ure, when they could laugh with equal Satisfaction at a <HI>Yates,</HI> as a <HI>Macklin.</HI> But if you examine the in|trin&s;ic Worth of the&s;e Men, you will &s;oon di&s;|cover, that they have but barely &s;ipp'd of the Fountain of Knowledge, or el&s;e were de&s;ign|ed by Nature, as mere Parenthe&s;es, that the World might either do with, or without; but from a partial Mi&s;take of their Parents, have been &s;ent to acquire what they can never obtain.</P>
<Q><L>And &s;o bewildered in the Maze of Schools,</L>
<L>They turn out Coxcombs, Nature meant but Fools.</L></Q>
<P>I am not &s;o old, but I can well remember the Time, when <HI>Hippe&s;ley,</HI> gave me as much plea&s;ure as <HI>John&s;on; Hurlo-Thrumbo,</HI> as <HI>Ho|race;</HI> but I am not a jot di&s;pleas'd at the Improvement of my Ta&s;te, and as I have &s;trongly at Heart the Welfare of every Indivi|dual, do, from the bottom of my Soul, wi&s;h that all tho&s;e to whom Wi&s;dom is burthen|&s;ome, were for their own Happine&s;s, and the Good of Mankind, what they &s;eem de|&s;irous
<PB N="10" REF="9">
of being, ab&s;olute Ideots, Blanks in the Creation.</P>
<P>On the&s;e Owlets, who&s;e Eyes are too weak to &s;u&s;tain the Shock of Light, I turn my Back, and addre&s;s my&s;elf to tho&s;e Eagles who are willing to &s;oar, and have Organs capable of &s;urveying the Sun in its Meridian, with them we will endeavour to explore the hid|den Sources of tho&s;e Pa&s;&s;ions, which either deform or dignify the Ma&s;ter-piece of the Creation, and attempt a De&s;cription of their fatal Con&s;equences, or &s;alutary Effects.</P>
<P>The word Pa&s;&s;ion is applied to the different Motions and Agitations of the Soul, ac|cording to the different Objects, that pre|&s;ent them&s;elves to the Sen&s;es; how or by what means this mutual Action, or Com|munication between Soul and Body is effect|ed, remains a Secret to us; all our Attempts to re&s;olve it into any thing prior, or more &s;imple have been fruitle&s;s and ineffectual, ex|cept we refer to the immediate Will and A|gency of the fir&s;t Cau&s;e it&s;elf. As all, who have hitherto treated on the Pa&s;&s;ions, are puzzled about their Number and Divi&s;ion, I &s;hall not attempt the Di&s;covery of a Secret which has eluded the Searches of &s;o many Philo&s;ophers, but content my&s;elf with the ordinary Di&s;tribution, <HI>viz.</HI> into the Pa&s;&s;ions of De&s;ire, &s;uch as Plea&s;ure, Pain, Love, Ha|tred, &amp;c. and the ira&s;cible ones, namely, Courage, Anger, De&s;pair, &amp;c. but the mo&s;t
<PB N="11" REF="10">
natural Divi&s;ion of them in my Judgment, is into painful and plea&s;ureable, and in this Sen&s;e, all the Pa&s;&s;ions may be reduced to Love and Hatred, nay perhaps to one, Love; and even that may be altogether re&s;olved in|to Self-Love, and this into a Principle of Self-Pre&s;ervation, or nece&s;&s;ary invincible De&s;ire of Plea&s;ure or Happine&s;s. The re&s;t are only Ri|vulets from this Source, or &s;pecial Applications of this Principle to particular Occa&s;ions, thus, the De&s;ire of any thing under the Appearance of its Goodne&s;s, Suitablene&s;s, or Nece&s;&s;ity; &s;o our Happine&s;s con&s;titutes the Pa&s;&s;ion of Love; the De&s;ire of avoiding any thing apprehended to be mi&s;chievous or hurtful, con&s;titutes Hatred or Aver&s;ion; the De&s;ire of a Good, which at the &s;ame time appears probable, and in our Reach con&s;titutes Hope, but if the Good appear improbable, difficult, or impo&s;&s;ible it con&s;titutes Fear or De&s;pair; the unexpected Ratification of a Wi&s;h creates Joy. The De&s;ire of Happine&s;s to another in Affliction is Compa&s;&s;ion; the De&s;ire of another's Puni&s;hment, Revenge, or Malice. The &s;ingle De&s;ire of Happine&s;s, then, is the Spring and Motive of all our Pa&s;&s;ions, as tho&s;e are of all our Actions, but as it is impo&s;|&s;ible to per&s;ue the Subject before us, with|out being to metaphy&s;ical and ab&s;tracted for every Comprehen&s;ion, and this Treati&s;e is calculated for the Meridian of all Capacities, I &s;hall at pre&s;ent, wave a farther Di&s;qui&s;ition
<PB N="12" REF="11">
into the Origin of the Pa&s;&s;ions, and apply my &s;elf to their &s;everal Effects on the Organs of our Bodies. With the Pa&s;&s;ion of Rage, we will begin, and here it mu&s;t be ob&s;erved that every Pa&s;&s;ion has &s;everal Degrees, &s;uitable to the Subject it is imployed about; the Expre&s;|&s;ion of the Voice and Eyes are quick, and le&s;s violent Rage is different from the Extra|vagance of that Pa&s;&s;ion; in the fir&s;t Circum|&s;tance, their is a Loudne&s;s in the Tone of the Voice, a Rapidity in the Utterance, and a live|ly Quickne&s;s in the Eye; in the la&s;t, the Vio|lence and Force of the Pa&s;&s;ion are curbs to our natural Powers, the Voice is low, but forcible, the Utterance $lower, and an extra|vagant Wildne&s;s in the Eye. But in every Degree of this Pa&s;&s;ion, the Mu&s;cles are contracted, and their Force encrea&s;ed, whe|ther this be occa&s;ioned by the Blood or Spirits being rapidly drove from the other Parts of the Body, to the extream and Mu&s;|cular ones, as the Arms, Legs and Face, we will leave to $h$ Determination of the Phy&s;icians. We will now pre&s;ent you with two In&s;tances, $n order to e&s;tabli&s;h the fore|going Ob&s;ervation, the fir&s;t in <HI>Richard</HI> the IIId&punc; the Reply of that Monarch to the Lord <HI>Stanly;</HI> take the Pa&s;&s;age: <HI>Richard,</HI> <Q>&startq;where are thy Forces then to $eat the Enemy back?&endq;</Q> <HI>Stanly,</HI> `my Forces are all ready in the North,' <HI>Richard,</HI> <Q>&startq;in the North, why what do they do in the North? when they &s;hould &s;erve their S$ver$$g$ $n the We&s;t&punc;&endq;</Q> here ob&s;erve
<PB N="13" REF="12">
the Execution and Judgment of Mr. <HI>G.</HI> His Imitation will give you a perfect Know|ledge of the Effects of the fir&s;t Degree of this Pa&s;&s;ion; with regard to the la&s;t, tho' the Actor has denied me his A&s;&s;i&s;tance, yet the Poet has done ju&s;tice to that Mode of the Mind, in the Character of <HI>Othello,</HI> <Q>&startq;Villain be &s;ure you prove my Love a Whore,&endq;</Q> to that Pa&s;&s;age, I refer the Reader. But why do I tire the Public with my trifling Ob&s;er|vations on this Pa&s;&s;ion, when the immortal <HI>Shake&s;pear,</HI> has &s;o finely de&s;cribed the Effects of Rage, in <HI>Harry</HI> the Vth that Monarch before an Engagement, is recommending a Deportment to his Men, and advi&s;es them to imitate the Action of the Tyger, &s;tiffen the Sinews, &s;ummons up the Blood, to lend the Eye a terrible A&s;pect; let it pry through the Portage of the Head, to &s;et the Teeth, and &s;tretch the No&s;trils wide, hold hard the Breath, and bend up every Spirit to his full Height.</P>
<P>The Effects of the Pa&s;&s;ions, are &s;o very different in different Men, and often &s;o com|plicated and mixed, that it would be almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible, to trace their &s;everal Connections, and de&s;cribe their various Effects, I &s;hall therefore bid adieu to the Subject in General, but may have many Opportunities in the Cour&s;e of this Tract, to pre&s;ent you with occa&s;ional Ob&s;ervations, on the Pa&s;&s;ions, &s;o far as they regard the particular Modes of par|ticular Minds.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="13">
Now let us examine how far the Conduct of the pre&s;ent Actors, is con&s;i&s;tent with the foregoing Rules: But as it would be a tedious Difficulty to run through a Di&s;qui&s;ition of the &s;everal Faults and Perfections of all the Play|ers, who are arrived to any Degree of Excel|lence, I &s;hall confine my&s;elf to tho&s;e alone, whom the Good or Prejudice of the Public have ranked in the fir&s;t Cla&s;s.</P>
<P>With <HI>G.</HI> who&s;e great Popularity has given him a claim to the Preheminence, we will begin. And as the Eye is the Scence fir&s;t gratified, or di&s;gu&s;ted, it may not be impro|per to enquire what kind of Prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion a|ri&s;es in the Mind, from the Appearance of Mr. <HI>G</HI>'s. Figure, and here I am afraid frail Nature has been a little unkind, and tho' I mu&s;t own I have very di&s;tinct Ideas of big and great, yet &s;uch is the Folly of the Million, that they expect a more than ordinary Ap|pearance from a Man, who is to perform ex|traordinary Actions; it is in vain, to tell them, that <HI>Charles</HI> of <HI>Sweden,</HI> was but five feet five, or <HI>Alexander</HI> the Great, a very lit|tle Man, the fal&s;e A&s;&s;ociation is &s;o deeply rooted into their Minds, that you may as well attempt to per&s;uade them that Night and Ap|paritions have no Connection: they are di&s;|&s;atisfied, when they &s;ee a Bulls-Pizzle, a dried Elves-Skin, in <HI>Fal&s;taff</HI>'s Language, bullying a Congregation of Heroes, and &s;u&s;pect the Veracity of the Poet, when he tells them, that the&s;e Men are
<Q><PB N="15" REF="14">
<L>Fit to di&s;turb the Peace of all the World,</L>
<L>And rule it when its wilde&s;t.</L></Q></P>
<P>But as the Advantage of a fine Figure, is merely an accidental Good, the Want of it &s;hould never draw an Imputation on Mr. <HI>G.</HI> e&s;pecially as there is nothing offen&s;ive in the Frame and Di&s;po&s;ition of his Body, and tho' his want of Stature, &amp;c. may le&s;&s;en the Dignity of &s;ome Characters, yet its properly enough adapted for others; nay, in my Opinion, this Defect adds greatly to the Merit of <HI>G.</HI> for if by the Force of Action, he can conquer a fir&s;t Prejudice, which is generally ob&s;tinate, it proves him po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a Genius, that few, very few Actors have been ble&s;&s;ed with. Thus much for his Per&s;on, in the Gro&s;s, but as the Face is more e&s;&s;entially concerned in acting, than all the other Parts of the Body, it may not be ami&s;s to examine how the Features of our little Hero are form'd, for what is called the Looking of a Character, his lively and pier|cing Eyes, are particularly happy in the Ex|pre&s;&s;ion of &s;udden Joy, or quick Rage; but I cannot &s;ay they convey the Pa&s;&s;ions of Love, Grief, and Horror with equal Force: as the Face is the Index of the Mind, the Voice is the Interpreter, which in Mr. <HI>G.</HI> is various, articulate and harmonious, to which, I wi&s;h I could add la&s;ting, but to
<PB N="16" REF="15">
the Mortification of his Hearers, it generally (in the Jockeys Phra&s;e,) rides re&s;ty, and &s;tops before half the Cour&s;e is run.</P>
<P>Thus much for the corporal Defects or Advantages of Mr. <HI>G.</HI> let us now take a View of him in Action, and con&s;ider whe|ther he is artful in the concealing his na|tural Blemi&s;hes, and judicious in the Ap|plication of his Talents; and for this Pur|po&s;e, it will be mo&s;t convenient both to the Reader, and my&s;elf, to regard him in a &s;ingle Light; let it be <HI>Lear,</HI> and I the rather chu&s;e this Character, becau&s;e Mr&punc; <HI>G.</HI> where he is right, is no where &s;o ma&s;terly.</P>
<P>The Portrait that <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> has given us of <HI>Lear,</HI> is that of a good hearted Man, ea&s;ily provoked, impatient of Contradiction, and ha&s;ty in Re&s;olution. The Poet him|&s;elf, who &s;eldom fails to direct the Actor, has thought an Apology nece&s;&s;ary at the o|pening of the Play, for what might appear immoral in the Conduct, or Expre&s;&s;ions of his Hero, by laying the Blame on a natural Habit, <HI>'tis &s;aid that I am Choleric;</HI> and then, as a Te&s;timony of the Humanity and innate Goodne&s;s of his Di&s;po&s;ition, upon hear|ing the tragical End of his unnatural Daugh|ters, at the Clo&s;e of the Play, this tender, this affectionate Expre&s;&s;ion is put into his Mouth.</P>
<LG>
<PB N="17" REF="16">
<L>Ungrateful as they were,</L>
<L>Tho' the Wrongs they have heaped on me are numberle&s;s;</L>
<L>I feel a Pang of Nature for them yet.</L>
</LG>
<P>This I take to be a Sketch of <HI>Lear</HI>'s moral Character, a Circum&s;tance that never ought to e&s;cape the View of the Actor.</P>
<P>And here, &s;orry I am, to &s;et out with an Ob&s;ervation that Mr. <HI>G.</HI> &s;eems quite regardle&s;s of, both <HI>Lear</HI>'s Attributes, and that at a junc|ture too, where the Poet's Excu&s;e is but barely &s;ufficient, and the Player's A&s;&s;i&s;tance ab&s;o|lutely nece&s;&s;ary; the Pa&s;&s;age I mean, is the Cur&s;e at the End of the fir&s;t Act, which in my Judgment, and I am not &s;ingular, &s;hould be utter'd with a Rage almo&s;t equal to Phren|zy, quick and rapid as a Whirlwind, no Mark of Malice, no Premeditation, no Solemnity; the Provocation, the Per&s;ons again&s;t whom the Cur&s;e is denounced, <HI>Lear</HI>'s Character, all con&s;pire to render &s;uch a Behaviour ab&s;urd: nor can I ea&s;ily pardon the Tears &s;hed at the Conclu&s;ion; the whole Pa&s;&s;age is a Climax of Rage; that &s;trange Mixture of Anger and Grief is to me highly unnatural; and be&s;ides, this unmanly Sniveling lowers the Con&s;equence of <HI>Lear;</HI> this&punc; Practice may, with Propriety, be introduced in the Imitation of a vex'd Girl, who cries becau&s;e &s;he can't (in the vulgar Tongue) gain her Ends. But dear <HI>G.</HI> get
<PB N="18" REF="17">
your Friend <HI>H&mdash;ym&mdash;n</HI> to draw an enraged Monarch, and &s;ee whether he will make any U&s;e of the Handkerchief: Nor can I admit the ill-judged Applau&s;e of the Multitude as a Plea for the Continuation of this Trick. The Tran&s;ition from one Pa&s;&s;ion to another, by the Suddenne&s;s of the Contra&s;t, throws a &s;tronger Light on the Execution of the Ac|tor; and thus the Groundlings, who are caught more by the Harmony and Power of the Voice than Propriety, are ea&s;ily drawn in to applaud what mu&s;t grieve the Judicious. I have been the longer on the la&s;t Particular, becau&s;e it is not in this Place alone, that Mr. <HI>G.</HI> traps the Unwary by the &s;ame Bait, his unreal Mockery in <HI>Macbeth,</HI> and two memo|rable Speeches in the fir&s;t Scene of <HI>Chamont,</HI> are In&s;tances which I hope he will hereafter never &s;uffer to ri&s;e in Judgment again&s;t him. We all now know how the Shilling came un|der the Candle&s;tick, the Trick is di&s;cover'd.</P>
<P>It will now (I pre&s;ume) be expected that I &s;hould, agreeable to my Promi&s;e, oppo&s;e to this Error in Mr. <HI>G.</HI> one of his Excellencies; but, for the &s;ake of Method, permit me fir&s;t to di&s;cover the Pa&s;&s;ages wherein I think him mi&s;taken, and then we will proceed to the Recital of his Perfections without Fear of In|terruption.</P>
<P>The next Scene in which <HI>Lear</HI> is capitally concern'd, and where I think Mr. <HI>G.</HI> &s;ome|times
<PB N="19" REF="18">
erroneous, is the Middle of the &s;econd Act.</P>
<P>The poor old King is introduced in a Storm, expo&s;ed to the Fury of the warring Ele|ments, and that no Circum&s;tance of Horror might be omitted, he is &s;urrounded by Dark|ne&s;s, and has no Companion in his Mi&s;ery, but a Man in whom he could place no Con|fidence, as having but ju&s;t entertain'd him; and here one would think it impo&s;&s;ible to ag|gravate the Di&s;tre&s;s, or increa&s;e our Pity, and yet the Poet has artfully contrived to heighten both, by throwing <HI>Lear</HI> into Madne&s;s.</P>
<P>Let us now take a View of the Actor's De|portment in this Situation; but it may not be improper fir&s;t to ob&s;erve, that as Madne&s;s is defin'd, to be right Rea&s;oning on wrong Principles, there is always a Con&s;i&s;tency in the Words and Actions of a Madman: Thus much may be gathered from a Scene naturally drawn, tho' by no means a Subject for Co|medy, in the <HI>Pilgrim</HI> of <HI>Fletcher</HI>'s, the &s;ot|ti&s;h <HI>Engli&s;hman</HI> does not command the Winds and Seas, nor the Scholar call for Beer; you find the whole Group of Lunaticks employ'd on the Circum&s;tances that fir&s;t di&s;turb'd their Imaginations; the Par&s;on, whom po&s;&s;ibly a long Law-Suit for Tithes had drove to Po|verty and De&s;pair, does not quit his Claim to a tenth Pig. But we need not have Recour&s;e to foreign A&s;&s;i&s;tance, the Subject before us will &s;ufficiently demon&s;trate what we want;
<PB N="20" REF="19">
the U&s;e I would make of the Obfervation is, that it be a Direction to the Actor to em|ploy his fir&s;t Enquiry into the Cau&s;e of the Madne&s;s he is to repre&s;ent, that his Deport|ment may be conducted &s;uitably therewith. For example in <HI>Lear;</HI> we find <HI>Lear</HI>'s Mind, at fir&s;t, entirely po&s;&s;e&s;s'd with the Thoughts of his Daughters Ingratitude, which was the immediate Cau&s;e of his Di&s;tre&s;s, to this he &s;ubjoins &s;ome Reflections on the State and Na|ture of his Afflictions, and thus far his Rea|&s;on holds; but when his Mind makes a far|ther Progre&s;s, and looks back to the remote Cau&s;e, which was a voluntary Re&s;ignation of the Regal Power, then the Idea of his former Grandeur ri&s;es to his View; which, when he compares with his pre&s;ent Mi&s;ery, and ob|&s;erves the Impo&s;&s;ibility of remounting the Throne he had quitted, then his Brains turn, and his Rea&s;on for&s;akes him.</P>
<P>The De&s;ire of Royalty then is the Point that di&s;tracts <HI>Lear</HI>'s Judgment; and the Be|lief that he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es that Royalty, the State of his Madne&s;s; all his Expre&s;&s;ions are full of the Royal Prerogative.</P>
<LG>
<L>&mdash;I pardon that Man's Life.</L>
<L>You cannot kill me for Coining, I am</L>
<L>The King him&s;elf.</L>

<P>How then is this mad Monarch to be em|ployed in picking Straws, and boyi&s;h
<PB N="21" REF="20">
Trifling, or in Actions more <HI>a-propos,</HI> more &s;uitable to his imaginary Dignity, &s;uch as fre|quent Mu&s;ings, with the Finger on the Brow, as if the Welfare of Kingdoms depend|ed on his Care, i&s;&s;uing Orders to his Atten|dan$s, or in &s;ome Act that expre&s;&s;es Regal Power; I own I am weak enough, tho' in Con|tradiction to Mr. <HI>G.</HI> to think the la&s;t Method be&s;t; and if my Advice might be taken, every Motion&punc; every Look, &s;hould expre&s;s an Ex|travagance of State and Maje&s;ty; and when mad <HI>Tom</HI> is con&s;ulted as a learned <HI>Theban: Lear</HI> &s;hould not, if he would be directed by me, pull his Rags, play with his Straws, or betray the lea&s;t Mark of his knowing the real Man; but with great Solemnity, a con|tracted Brow, one Hand on <HI>Edgar's</HI> Shoul|der, his Finger on his Brea&s;t, or &s;ome Action that &s;hould denote Superiority, &s;eem to con|&s;ult him on a knotty Point, but no Sign of Equality, no Familiarity, no &s;itting down Cheek by Jowl; this might be a proper Re|pre&s;entarion of a mad Taylor, but by no means corre&s;ponds with my Idea of King <HI>Lear.</HI></P>
<P>Nor &s;hould he be le&s;s in earne&s;t in all his Stratagems; his Project for &s;hoeing a Troop of Hor&s;e with Felt, &s;hould be delivered with Rapture, as if he had hit on a ma&s;terly Ex|pedient; nor would I have him expre&s;s le&s;s Joy, but with a Tincture of Bitterne&s;s and Rancour, at &s;urveying the Execution of his Scheme, when he &s;hould have it in his Power to revenge his Wrongs,
<Q><PB N="22" REF="21">
<L>Steal upon his Sons-in-law,</L></Q>
and then,
<Q><L>Kill, kill, kill.</L></Q></P>
<P>How far this Pa&s;&s;age has been mi&s;taken by Mr. <HI>G.</HI> I &s;ubmit to the Judicious; and here let me add, that I will undertake to demon|&s;trate, that <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> has not put one Ex|pre&s;&s;ion into the Mouth of <HI>Lear</HI> throughout the whole Cour&s;e of his Madne&s;s, but what bears a vi&s;ible Relation to the fir&s;t Cau&s;e of it.</P>
<P>As the&s;e are the principal Mi&s;takes we have to lay to Mr. <HI>G</HI>'s. Charge, the Gratifica|tion of his Enemies is at an end; his Friends may now uncloud their Brow, throw a&s;ide their Chagrin, and prepare for a Recital of his Perfections.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>G</HI>'s. whole Behaviour during the fir&s;t Act (except as before excepted) is natural and ma&s;terly, the choleric Man happily marked in the Scenes with <HI>Cordelia, Kent,</HI> and at the Di&s;covery of his elde&s;t Daughter's Ingratitude; and indeed, wherever quick Rage is to be expre&s;s'd, no Actor does the Poet &s;o much Ju&s;tice, nor is he le&s;s &s;ncce&s;sful in tincturiug all the Pa&s;&s;ions, with a certain Feeblene&s;s &s;uitable to the Age of the King, the De&s;ign of the Author, and the rai&s;ing in the Minds of the Audience a &s;tronger

Feeling, and Compa&s;&s;ion for <HI>Lear</HI>'s Suffer|ings. And tho', in the general Conduct of the&punc; mad Scenes, Mr. <HI>G.</HI> is, in my Opinion, faulty; yet in many particular In&s;tances, his Judgment and Execution demands the highe&s;t Applau&s;e. There is a Mixture of Di&s;traction, with the Joy, that he expre&s;&s;es at
<Q><L>Was it not plea&s;ant to &s;ee a Thou&s;and, with red-hot Spits, come hi&s;&s;ing in upon them.</L></Q>
that I have &s;eldom &s;een equall'd; nor can he be ea&s;ily excell'd where the Tortures of <HI>Lear</HI>'s Mind, and the Fatigues of his Body, throw him into a Swoon, <HI>G</HI>'s Preparation is fine&punc; and the Execution of the Thing it&s;elf inimitable, &s;uch a Death-like Palene&s;s in his Countenance, &s;uch an Inactivity in his Limbs, that only <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI>'s Words can do him Ju&s;tice,
<Q><L>He is indeed Death's Counterfeit.</L></Q>
Nor can I leave him without my particular Thanks for the Entertainment he has given me at his Recovery from Madne&s;s, and Re|collection of <HI>Cordelia.</HI> The Pa&s;&s;ions of Joy, Tenderne&s;s, Grief, and Shame are blended together in &s;o ma&s;terly a Manner, that the Imitation would do Honour to the Pencil of a <HI>Rubens,</HI> or an <HI>Angelo.</HI></P>
<P>The la&s;t Circum&s;tance that I &s;hall trou|ble the Reader with, is the fatigue, weari|ne&s;s,

and at the &s;ame time, &s;oldier-like and manly Plea&s;ure that <HI>G.</HI> expre&s;&s;es at having vanqui&s;hed the Mini&s;ters of his inhuman Daughter's la&s;t Commands. I could add one Ob&s;ervation to the foregoing, but as I differ from the Actor, tho' I mu&s;t own &s;ome Ar|guments may be brought in his Defence, and I have promi&s;ed to mention no more of his Faults, I &s;hall be &s;ilent, and am, for once plea&s;ed with <HI>Tate</HI>'s Alteration of <HI>Shake&s;pear,</HI> becau&s;e it has prevented my commenting on Mr. <HI>G</HI>'s. Manner of Dying, about which, I am afraid, we &s;hould have &s;ome Di&s;putes.</P>
<P>At la&s;t then the Ta&s;k is fini&s;hed, and hap|py &s;hall I e&s;teem my&s;elf, if the&s;e loo&s;e Hints can contribute to improve the general Ta&s;te of the Publick, or convey the lea&s;t In&s;truction to a very great, I wi&s;h I could add, perfect Actor.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Q.</HI> next claims our Attention; and as his Superiority in the Character of <HI>Othello</HI> had been univer&s;ally allow'd, 'till a Caveat was entered by a young and new Actor from <HI>Dublin,</HI> it may not be unentertaining to op|po&s;e the&s;e great Men&punc;in this Part, and exa|mine to which the Laurel is due.</P>
<P>As <HI>G</HI>'s. Per&s;on is &s;o in&s;ignificant and trifling, <HI>Q</HI>'s. is too cumber&s;ome and un|weildy; as the fir&s;t is deficient in Characters that require Con&s;equence and Dignity, &s;o is the la&s;t in tho&s;e that demand Ea&s;e and Bu&s;tle.</P>

I would here con&s;ider the Di&s;po|&s;ition of the Features in the&s;e Gentlemen, but as the black Covering in this Part before us, hinders our di&s;cerning the Action of the Mu&s;cles, we cannot determine to which the Preference ought to be given, only from a general Ob&s;ervation, <HI>Q.</HI> would, were the Blacking removed, be mo&s;t &s;ucce&s;sful in the Scenes of Rage, <HI>B.</HI> in tho&s;e of Tenderne&s;s.</P>

The old Gentleman's Tale, from Want of Varie|ty, is not quite &s;o entertaining to us, as it was to <HI>De&s;demona;</HI> and the young one's, his
<PB N="26" REF="25">
Friends &s;ay, from Diffidence, rather too flat and in&s;ipid.</P>
<P>It was a Saying of one of the <HI>Roman</HI> Orators to a Client, who had given him a long Detail of the ill Treatment he had received from a Neighbour: <Q>&startq;Friend, this Account can't be genuine, your Narration is too cold; had you really been as ill-us'd as you &s;ay, your Rage, on the Recital, would be equal to the Provocation.&endq;</Q> Can <HI>Othello,</HI> then, a Man of Honour, and a Soldier, hear him&s;elf accu&s;ed of u&s;ing Spells, and having recour&s;e to Witchcraft, without te&s;tifying a Warmth in the Defence of his Reputation: Nor would it be ea&s;y for a Man of his Character, who had made the flinty and Steel-couch of War his thrice-driven Bed of Down, to recall to his Mind the Battles, Sieges&punc; and di&s;a&s;trous Chances he had en|counter'd, without being animated with the Story, and &s;hewing different Emotions, &s;ui|table to the various Accidents of his Life. Turn your Eye to the Deportment of one of your Companions, upon the Repetition of an Adventure that bears but a remote Relation to the Subject before us, your Ob&s;ervations there, will be more convincing than any Ar|guments I can produce. <HI>B</HI>'s. De&s;ign in this Pa&s;&s;age, &s;eems to be nearer&punc; the Mark than the other's, but from Inexperience, or Timi|dity, he is va&s;tly defective in the Execution;

if the fir&s;t, it will &s;oon be corrected; and the la&s;t, as it flows from a Diffidence of him|&s;elf, and is a Proof of his Re&s;pect and Defe|rence for the Judgment of the Audience, ought to meet with the highe&s;t Indul|gence.</P>
<P>The &s;econd Act brings <HI>Othello</HI> and <HI>De&s;|demona</HI> to <HI>Cyprus,</HI> where the Rapture of both is increa&s;ed, by the Fears they had &s;u&s;tained for each other, during the late Storm&punc; And here, from the Sweetne&s;s and Compa&s;s of Mr. <HI>B</HI>'s. Voice, he is much &s;uperior to Mr. <HI>Q.</HI> There is, indeed, a Mixture of Di&s;tre&s;s in his Joy, which, as he cannot employ with any Kind of Propriety in this Place, I &s;hould be glad he would part with. The next Scene is the quelling of a Broil contrived by <HI>Iago</HI> on the Watch; the Time, the Place, the Per&s;ons, one would imagine, &s;hould here convey &s;ufficient In&s;tructions to the Actor, and yet neither <HI>Q.</HI> nor <HI>B.</HI> are correctly right: The fir&s;t has Dignity without Rage, the la&s;t Rage without Dignity; when the former re|proaches the Mutineers with their being in a Town of War,
<Q><L>Yet wild, the People's Hearts brim full of Fear.</L></Q>
his Utterance is as &s;toical as at
<Q><L>Fathers, we once again are met in Council.</L></Q>
<PB N="28" REF="27">
And when the latter di&s;charges <HI>Ca&s;&s;io</HI> from the Service, his Behaviour is that of a Gen|tleman &s;tripping a Valet de Chambre, and not a General ca&s;hiering an Officer: Nor is he le&s;s mi&s;taken in his Addre&s;s to <HI>Montano,</HI> his Upbraidings are de&s;titute both of Warmth, and Bitterne&s;s.

<P>But we mu&s;t now prepare our Attention for the third Act, the great Scene of Bu&s;i|ne&s;s; and here I could wi&s;h for a larger Compa&s;s than this Tract will afford me; I would then endeavour to pay my little Tri|bute to the Genius of the Author, at the &s;ame time that I am attempting to do Ju&s;tice to the Skill of the Actor; but circum&s;cribed as I am, I can take no Notice of the for|mer, but as it a&s;&s;i&s;ts my Ob&s;ervations on the latter.</P>
<P>The great Fault I have to charge the Actors with in this Scene, is their betraying a Con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of what is to &s;ucceed; or, in other Words, being jealous before they have rea&s;on. <HI>Iago,</HI> in all the Speeches that work up <HI>Othello</HI> to the Height he de&s;ires, does not drop the lea&s;t Hint of the Di&s;loyalty of <HI>De&s;|demona,</HI> but only gives his Friend to under|&s;tand,

<P>The Increa&s;e of Rage at the Ob&s;tinacy of <HI>Iago</HI> is natural enough, but why &s;hould the Jea|lou&s;y be received here, more than at any other foregoing Pa&s;&s;age of the Play? And be|&s;ides, the Artifice of <HI>Iago</HI> is de&s;troyed by this Means, who, &s;eeing the Rea&s;on of <HI>Othello</HI> di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by a Torrent of contending Pa&s;&s;i|ons, &s;eizes on the Opportunity of pouring into his Mind a Su&s;picion, which, at another Time, would have been denied Admittance, and &s;o with no other Preparation than the rai&s;ing a Storm, which he knew how to di|vert, he comes plump at once with,
<Q><L>O! my Lord, beware of Jealou&s;y.</L></Q>

<P>You have, Sir, I doubt not, been often told; that your Expre&s;&s;ions of Grief and Tenderne&s;s are very becoming, and they told you Truth; but let not this Per&s;ua&s;ion draw you into a Pro&s;titution of the Excel|lence; for, not to mention that your Judg|ment will &s;uffer in the Eyes of the Di&s;cerning, your hackneying the Pa&s;&s;ion, and applying it indi&s;criminately, will take from its Weight, and lower its Force, even with the Injudici|ous: If you cry one Minute for Joy, and another for Sorrow, as in Lord <HI>Townly,</HI> a Man would be puzzled to know whether you were angry or plea&s;ed; and, in the pre|&s;ent Ca&s;e, a Degree of Anger is rather the Pa&s;&s;ion than Sorrow.</P>
<P>The Clo&s;e of the &s;econd Speech has, in|deed, &s;ome Di&s;tre&s;s; <HI>Othello's Occupation's</HI>
<PB N="32" REF="31">
<HI>gone;</HI> and is finely calculated by the Author for the Advantage of the Actor; the Rage that en&s;ues upon the Sight of <HI>Iago,</HI> who was the immediate Cau&s;e of <HI>Othello</HI>'s Affliction, is a fine Oppo&s;ition to the re&s;ign'd, calm De&s;pair that preceeds it: I can't boa&s;t much of the Execution of either <HI>Q.</HI> or <HI>B.</HI> in the climactick Speech of
<Q><L>Villain, be &s;ure.</L></Q>
I call it one Speech, for tho&s;e little Breaks of,

Action and Attitude, with the Totterings of <HI>Iago,</HI> convey to my Mind a pretty &s;trong Idea of Wre&s;tling, but do not di&s;turb my Tranquillity with any Emotions of Terror; nor does <HI>Q</HI>'s. Method of Collaring and quitting, and then collaring again, cor|re&s;pond with my Conception of the Pa&s;&s;age: There is a Connection through the whole Speech; and, to give the Mind an Opportu|nity of cooling by a Walk cro&s;s the Stage, is an Error that I could not have thought Mr. <HI>Q</HI>'s. Experience would have committed. Nor do I much admire the Utterance of either <HI>Q.</HI> or <HI>B.</HI> in this Place; the Growl of the fir&s;t

is as far from right, as the Vociferation of the la&s;t; the former wants Fury, and the latter a forcible Energy, which Loudne&s;s can never couvey. An Octavo would &s;carce have Room enough for a minute and critical Enquiry into the Defects and Perfections of both the&s;e Gentlemen in this Part.</P>

And what an Earne&s;tne&s;s does he expre&s;s for the Succe&s;s of her &s;hort Prayer,
<Q><L>Amen, with all my Heart.</L></Q></P>
<P>With this, take a View of his Behaviour after the Di&s;covery of her Innocence, and then tell me, whether the Tenderne&s;s, Love, Grief and Pity, that <HI>B.</HI> blends with every Incident in the two la&s;t Acts, or the &s;tern, brutal, unfeeling Behaviour of <HI>Q.</HI> be mo&s;t con&s;i&s;tent with the true Character of <HI>O|thello.</HI></P>
<P>I cannot but confe&s;s, notwith&s;tanding all I have &s;aid of Mr. <HI>B.</HI> that frequent Trips are made by him in &s;everal Pa&s;&s;ages of the Play, but as he has the Pleas of Youth and Inexpe|rience in his Favour, I &s;hall leave him to Time for Amendment and private Correcti|on; but if through Vanity he continues ob|&s;tinate, he mu&s;t expect a publick Admoni|tion. With one Hint more I &s;hall leave him, and that is with regard to his Deport|ment: In the Pa&s;&s;ion of Grief, by a vil|lainous Habit, he throws his Body out of the Line, his Head is projected, and his Body
<PB N="36" REF="35">
drawn tottering after. But for a more pic|ture&s;que De&s;cription of his Figure, take this Line of <HI>Pope</HI>'s,
<Q><L>And, like a wounded Snake, draws his &s;low Length along.</L></Q>
Not to mention the cla&s;ping of the Hands together, which is either an aukward Action, or aukwardly executed; but were it ever &s;o graceful, it is too frequently repeated.</P>
<P>There is no Part that I can at pre&s;ent re|collect, which &s;o ab&s;olutely depends on what the Laureat figuratively calls, the Returning of the Ball, as the Character in que&s;tion. I defy the greate&s;t <HI>Othello</HI> that ever was born, unle&s;s he be well provided with an Antient, properly to expre&s;s either the Hero or the jealous Lover: Nor, indeed, can the Skill and Addre&s;s of <HI>Iago</HI> be placed in a con&s;picuous Light without the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of a judicious <HI>Othello.</HI> Suppo&s;e then, as the&s;e Characters are &s;o clo&s;ely connected, we be&s;tow a few Periods on the mo&s;t artful, in&s;inuating, thorough-paced Villain that ever was in|debted for Detection and Infamy to the Pen of a Poet.</P>
<P>And here, were I inclined to favour the Prejudices of the Public, I &s;hould intreat, not demand their Regard to an Actor, who, in the Part of <HI>Iago,</HI> is at lea&s;t equal to any
<PB N="37" REF="36">
<HI>Othello</HI> this Age has produced; but as my pre&s;ent Purpo&s;e is the Di&s;covery of Ab&s;urdity and Ignorance, however protected by partial Popularity, and the drawing from Ob&s;curity real Merit, however depre&s;&s;ed by Folly or Faction, take my &s;incere Sentiments of <HI>Macklin</HI> in the Character of <HI>Iago</HI> without Apology.</P>
<P>Be it our fir&s;t Care then to con&s;ider in what Light (I mean as to Quality and For|tune) <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> has pre&s;ented <HI>Iago</HI> to us. I think we may venture to affirm, that the En&s;ign was a Dependant on the General; nay, perhaps a Dome&s;tick, from the Im|ployment a&s;&s;ign'd to <HI>Emilia,</HI>
<Q><L>I pray thee let thy Wife attend on her.</L></Q>
This may be &s;afely concluded: Be&s;ides, we find <HI>Othello</HI> frequently imploying <HI>Iago</HI> in Offices that bear no relation to his Com|mand,
<Q><L>Go to the Port and di&s;embark my Coffers.</L>
<L>Fetch De&s;demona hither, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</L></Q>
My Penetration can di&s;cover but one Place where <HI>Iago</HI> offers at di&s;obeying the Injuncti|ons of his Ma&s;ter,
<Q><L>I do not like the Office.</L></Q>
<PB N="38" REF="37">
And here &s;o many other Rea&s;ons may be a&s;|&s;igned be&s;ides Equality of Condition, that no Conclu&s;ion can be fairly drawn, oppo&s;ite to what has been advanced. I have been the longer on this Point, becau&s;e, on the Settling of it, depends the Propriety of <HI>Macklin</HI>'s Deportment thro' the whole Play.</P>
<P>If then there be no Difference between the&s;e Characters but what is given by a &s;upe|rior Commi&s;&s;ion; that is, was the State of the <HI>Venetian</HI> Army the &s;ame as with us, <HI>Mack|lin</HI>'s Conduct is wrong; but if <HI>Iago</HI>'s Situa|tion was what I have pre&s;um'd it, his di&s;tant ob&s;equious Behaviour is critically right, and the Judgment both of his Competitors and Cen&s;urers erronecus and ab&s;urd.</P>
<P>Let us now proceed to examine whether Mr. <HI>Macklin</HI> is happy in looking this Cha|racter. I think it is generally agreed that his Mu&s;cles are luckily formed for marking the Villain; but it has been objected, that Nature has denied him the Advantage of expre&s;&s;ing the open, &s;incere, hone&s;t Man; or, in other Words, of playing the Hypocrite well in this Part. If the&s;e witty Gentlemen will tell me what Rules they have for judging of Counte|nances, I &s;hall think their Critici&s;m worth an An&s;wer; but let <HI>Macklin</HI>'s Vi&s;age be ever &s;o unfortunate, I am &s;ure he has the Art of looking more like a Rogue at one Time than another, which is all that either I, they, or
<PB N="39" REF="38" MS="Y">
the Poet have a Right to expect from him.</P>
<P><HI>Macklin</HI>'s Skill and Judgment cannot be &s;ufficiently commended in the third Act. I have &s;een an applauded Player, puffed with the low Ambition of being the di&s;tingui&s;hed Per|former, crack his Lungs, &s;plit his own Trembling-pipe, and our Ears, in order to catch an ignorant <HI>Bene</HI> from the hard Hands of the Gallery. Be it <HI>Macklin</HI>'s peculiar Ex|cellence not to attempt the obtaining more Con&s;equence, or a higher Regard than the Author has thought fit to allow him; from his mode&s;t and decent Deportment, you are always taught that he has a Superior, both in Quality and Character, on the Stage. Oh! cur&s;e on tho&s;e unmannerly bellowing Blu&s;|terers. Go, go ye <HI>Herods;</HI> go, and learn that Sentiments, nay, Pa&s;&s;ions can have Energy and Force, without Noi&s;e and Vociferation. Reform, ye Ranters! or, by <HI>Thalia, Clio,</HI> and all the Nine, who&s;e In&s;pirations you have villainou&s;ly abu&s;ed, I'll attack you in the Face of the Audience; and, with the Pipe of <HI>Gracchus,</HI> force you to Moderation, ye Termagants!</P>
<P>But to proceed. Heigh ho! Lord! what a Fury am I in: P&mdash;x take the&s;e Fellows, th$y have &s;o rouz'd my Gall, that I am quite unfit for Panegyrick; and as <HI>Macklin</HI> has been &s;uch an ill-natur'd Cur as to give me no Open for Invective and Satire in the Play
<PB N="40" REF="39">
before us, I &s;hall leave him, till I find my&s;elf in a Di&s;po&s;ition capable of doing Ju&s;tice to his Merit, and my Sen&s;e of it.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Q.</HI> I &s;u&s;pect, will be thought to make but an odd Kind of Figure in this Pamphlet: Why, be it right or wrong, as he appears in my Eye, you have him; if you except one or two Stoical Characters, Mr. <HI>Q</HI>'s. Merit, as a Tragedian, is not very high in my Opinion. In <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI>'s Plays you have very little De|clamation; and where the Pa&s;&s;ions are to be expre&s;&s;ed, Mr. <HI>Q.</HI> appears to me, be&s;ides the Ab&s;ence of &s;ome natural Powers, to want one Requi&s;ite, without which no Performer will ever plea&s;e me; that is, Feeling.</P>
<P>But tho' this Gentleman does not become the Bu&s;kin, no Man appears with more Suc|ce&s;s in the Sock, and glad I &s;hould have been had it come within my pre&s;ent Purpo&s;e, to have paid him due Acknowledgments for the Plea&s;ure he has given me in <HI>Fal&s;taff, Ma&s;k|well,</HI> and, indeed, all his Comic Parts. But if the publick Regard &s;hould attend my pre|&s;ent Labours, his Excellence, with that of his Fellow-Labourers in the &s;ame Vineyard, may be &s;oon the Subject of another Pam|phlet.</P>
<P>And now, Reader, if thou ha&s;t any G$$d|nature indulge me with thy Attention, $word$ I be&s;tow a few Periods on my&s;elf and my Work. A young Writer, which I profe&s;s
<PB N="41" REF="40">
my&s;elf, and I don't de&s;pair of being believed, has a Kind of Right by Pre&s;cription to re|&s;erve two Pages to him&s;elf; not that I &s;hould, at this Time, have exerted my Prerogative, had not my Book&s;eller informed me, that my Copy was deficient almo&s;t Half a Sheet: You are, therefore, to regard all that follows, not as calculated for Information or Enter|tainment, but merely de&s;igned to fatisfy the craving Appetite of tho&s;e who in&s;i&s;t on de|vouring &s;uch a Number of Lines and Words for their Twelvepence.</P>
<P>To &s;et forward then. This Treati&s;e is a&mdash;, a&mdash;, a&mdash;; the D&mdash;l take me if I know what to &s;ay:&mdash;Thus it is to force a Genius. Hold; let me think:&mdash;Oh! now I have it, that this Treati&s;e (as its Force is levelled again&s;t that <HI>Hydra,</HI> Prejudice) will have many Enemies, I don't doubt; that it will give great Enter|tainment to the Frequenters of a certain Coffee-Hou&s;e I have as little doubt: Me|thinks I behold the in&s;ulting Tyrants gather round my Fir&s;t-born, my early, only Hope. See how they tear him! now, now they mangle him. Oh! my poor Boy,

Food for Criticks. Then, Sirrah! be it my Advantage over thee, that I have obliged one Man in my Life; thy Prattle is in&s;olent; thy Silence ill-natur'd, and thy Works &s;o ap|parently bad, that thou denie&s;t tho&s;e very Criticks the Reputation of di&s;covering an Error.
