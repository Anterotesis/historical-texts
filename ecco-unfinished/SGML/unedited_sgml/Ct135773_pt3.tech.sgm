<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THOUGH the Character of Mr.
SHENSTONE is too well known, and
his Reputation as a Writer too firmly e&s;ta|bli&s;hed,
to require any further commenda|tion,
yet it may perhaps be expected that
&s;ome apology &s;hould be made for this Ad|ditional
Volume of his Works, containing
Familiar Letters to &s;ome of his mo&s;t in|timate
Friends.</P>
<P>To tho&s;e who may think &s;uch an apo|logy
requi&s;ite, it might be &s;ufficient to &s;ay,
that the reception which the former Vo|lumes
have met with, affords the &s;tronge&s;t
rea&s;on to believe that an addition to them
would be very acceptable to the Public;
and that the Author's talent in <HI>epi&s;tolary</HI>
writing appears not to have been inferior to
that which di&s;tingui&s;hes his other compo|&s;itions.</P>
<P><PB N="iv" REF="3">
BUT it may be objected, that, whatever
their merit may be, <HI>Letters,</HI> not intended
for the Public, ought not to be publi&s;hed;
and that an act of this kind is a violation of
Private Friend&s;hip.</P>
<P>THIS objection, it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, car|ries
with it &s;uch an air of delicacy, that the
per&s;ons here concerned are very willing to
give it all due attention. At the &s;ame time
they cannot but ob&s;erve, that it will not
hold in all ca&s;es, and therefore mu&s;t un|avoidably
be &s;ubject to &s;ome limitations&mdash;
that the&s;e limitations mu&s;t vary, as the cir|cum&s;tances
of ca&s;es happen to vary&mdash;and
that not to make proper allowances for &s;uch
circum&s;tances is highly unrea&s;onable&mdash;in|jurious
to many who have de&s;erved well of
the Public by this very conduct, and detri|mental
to the intere&s;ts of Literature. It
might perhaps be difficult, and is by no
means nece&s;&s;ary, to enumerate the&s;e &s;everal
limitations. It will be &s;ufficient in this
place to &s;ay, that where neither the repu|tation
<PB N="v" REF="4">
of the Writer, nor that of any other
per&s;on, is injured, there the force of the
objection evidently cea&s;es. And it is not
only believed, on the mo&s;t mature delibera|tion,
that this is the ca&s;e in the pre&s;ent in|&s;tance;
but moreover that there are po&s;itive
good rea&s;ons in its favour, re&s;pecting as
well the Writer's character in this <HI>&s;pecies</HI> of
compo&s;ition, as the &s;atisfaction and enter|tainment
of the Reader.</P>
<P>THE encouragement which has been
u&s;ually given to Works of this nature
might &s;eem to make the&s;e ob&s;ervations un|nece&s;&s;ary!
But it was not thought &s;ufficient
barely to &s;helter this publication under the
&s;anction of &s;uch an authority; as it is well
known that the wantonne&s;s of curio&s;ity has
&s;ometimes encouraged de&s;igns by no means
ju&s;tifiable: and it is as readily acknowledg|ed
that the following Letters are deficient
in many particulars requi&s;ite to excite that
curio&s;ity, being neither written on popular
&s;ubjects, nor addre&s;&s;ed to per&s;ons of rank
<PB N="vi" REF="5">
and eminence in the world. They will not
fail however to afford an agreeable enter|tainment
to &s;uch as can reli&s;h an animated
di&s;play of the various efforts of a fine Ima|gination
for a length of years, whether
amu&s;ing it&s;elf with rural embelli&s;hments, or
occupied in other plea&s;ures of learned re|tirement,
and a warm di&s;intere&s;ted friend|&s;hip.
Such are the &s;ubjects of the follow|ing
Letters! and if any per&s;on &s;hould &s;till
retain a doubt concerning the propriety of
perpetuating them in this manner, he &s;hall
be finally referred to the Writer's own au|thority,
who, in a letter dated October 23,
1754, thus expre&s;&s;es him&s;elf:</P>
<P>&startq;I CONFESS to you that I am con&s;idera|bly
mortified by Mr. W&mdash;'s conduct in
regard to tho&s;e Letters (meaning his own
letters to that gentleman's brother); and,
rather than they &s;hould have been &s;o un|nece&s;&s;arily de&s;troyed, would have given
more money than it is allowable for me
to mention with decency. I look upon
<PB N="vii" REF="6">
my Letters as &s;ome of my <HI>chef-d'oeuvres;</HI>
and could I be &s;uppo&s;ed to have the &s;mal|le&s;t
preten&s;ions to propriety of &s;tyle or &s;en|timent,
I &s;hould imagine it mu&s;t appear
principally in my Letters to his brother,
and one or two more friends. I con&s;ider
them as the records of a friend&s;hip that
will be always dear to me, and as the
hi&s;tory of my mind for the&s;e twenty years
pa&s;t.&endq;</P>
<P>WHEN it is con&s;idered how &s;eldom &s;o
valuable a collection of real corre&s;pondence
is to be met with, and how difficult it is to
&s;upply the want of it by a fictitious one, it
cannot be doubted that the Public will be
plea&s;ed to &s;ee the lo&s;s here complained of &s;o
well repaired, and to be furni&s;hed with &s;uch
genuine examples of the Author's &s;tyle and
&s;entiments, together with an authentic hi&s;tory
of his mind, for &s;o long a &s;pace of time.</P>
<P>To conclude: The talents of this Au|thor,
on whatever &s;ubject they were exerci&s;ed,
<PB N="viii" REF="7">
were &s;o uncommon, and the fame of his lit|tle
<HI>Ferme orn&eacute;e,</HI> under the conduct of a ta&s;te
entirely original, was become &s;o con&s;iderable,
that every &s;pecimen of the one, and every
anecdote relative to the improvement of the
other, &s;eemed too intere&s;ting to be buried
in oblivion: at lea&s;t, they were thought &s;o
by tho&s;e to whom the <HI>greater</HI> part of this
Collection is addre&s;&s;ed:&mdash;per&s;ons indeed
confe&s;&s;edly partial to the Writer's talents,
and intere&s;ted in his commendations; but
at the &s;ame time per&s;ons neither &s;o regard|le&s;s
of their Friend's reputation, nor their
own, as to have hazarded either, without
the &s;tronge&s;t per&s;ua&s;ion that their partiality
had not impo&s;ed upon their judgement;
and that it was no indecent o&s;tentation in
them, by this public act, to te&s;tify, that
they e&s;teemed it not only a peculiar felicity
in their fortunes, but likewi&s;e &s;ome degree
of credit, to have enjoyed the plea&s;ures of
&s;uch a Friend&s;hip throughout &s;o con&s;iderable
a period of human life.</P>

<SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AS my head is con&s;iderably more confu&s;ed than
u&s;ual, by rea&s;on of a bad cold, I &s;hall aim no
higher in this letter than at bare <HI>recitative,</HI> re&s;erving
all my <HI>airs</HI> for a &s;ea&s;on when my mind is more in <HI>tune.</HI>
Such, I hope, will be the time which you &s;et apart to
attend the <HI>chief mu&s;ician,</HI> at Birmingham. I thorough|ly
<PB N="2" REF="9">
de&s;ign to lend an <HI>ear</HI> to <HI>his</HI> performance, on condi|tion
he will not refu&s;e one to a propo&s;al I intend to
make, of having, one day or other, a merry &s;train as
The Lea&s;owes. But if you have any <HI>penchant</HI> to &s;ee
the face of your humble &s;ervant at Birmingham, your
mo&s;t effectual way will be to inform him when the&s;e
&s;olemn nuptials betwixt Tweedle-dum and Tweedle-dee
are to be con&s;ummated. I will, <HI>certes,</HI> not be
ab&s;ent at the throwing of the &s;tocking, any more
than Par&s;on Evans in Shake&s;pear would be &startq;ab&s;ence
at the grace.&endq; I have &s;ent a &s;ong, not that I am
&s;ure I have not &s;ent it before; but that, if you can
&s;ee any joke that it containeth, the fore-mentioned
gentleman may be a&s;ked to tran&s;late it into mu&s;ic.
When I u&s;e this expre&s;&s;ion, you will, peradventure,
look upon it as my opinion, that in mu&s;ical compo|&s;itions
&s;ound ought as much to an&s;wer &s;en&s;e as one
language does another, in&s;omuch, that &s;uch and
&s;uch thoughts ought to bring into our heads &s;uch and
&s;uch &s;ounds, and <HI>vice ver&s;a.</HI> But in ca&s;e there is no
&s;en&s;e, and no thought, the more languages a &s;entence
is tran&s;lated into, the more 'tis expo&s;ed. And in
ca&s;e it be the misfortune of my little piece to have
neither, I beg that Mr. Marriett may not inform any|body
what it &s;ignifies in mu&s;ic. As a farther proof
of the confu&s;ed &s;tate of my intellects, you &s;ee, almo&s;t
at the end of my letter, my thanks for the packet,

<OPENER><DATE>1739.</DATE></OPENER>
<P>WELL! and &s;o I fat me down in my room,
and was reading <HI>Pamela</HI>&mdash;one might furpipeni&s;h
this book with &s;everal pretty decorations, thought
I to my&s;elf; and then I began to de&s;ign cuts for it,
in particular places. For in&s;tance, one, where Pa|mela
is forced to fall upon her knees in the arbor:
a &s;econd, where &s;he is in bed, and Mrs. Jewkes holds
one hand, and Mr. B. the other: a third, where Pa|mela
&s;its &s;ewing in the &s;ummer-hou&s;e, &amp;c. So I ju&s;t
&s;ketched them cut, and &s;ent my little hints, &s;uch as
they were, to Mr. R&mdash;n. As &s;oon as I had &s;ealed
my letter, in comes Mrs. Arnold<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">His hou&s;e-keeper, of whom very re&s;pectful mention is made in the cour&s;e of' this corre&s;pondence.</NOTE>&mdash;&startq;Well, Mrs.
Arnold, &s;ays I, this Mr. Jago never comes&mdash;what
can one do? I'm as dull as a beetle for want of
company.&endq; &startq;Sir, &s;ays &s;he, the hen&mdash;&endq; &startq;What
makes you out of breath? &s;ays I, Mrs. Arnold;
what's the matter?&endq; &startq;Why, Sir, &s;ays &s;he, the
hen that I &s;et la&s;t-&s;abbath-day-was-three-weeks has
ju&s;t hatched, and has brought all her eggs to
good.&endq; &startq;That's brave indeed, &s;ays I.&endq; &startq;Ay, that
it is, &s;ays &s;he, &s;o be and't plea&s;e G&mdash;d an how that

<PB N="5" REF="12">

&startq;No, thank ye, Mrs. Arnold, &s;ays I; but aren't

I thought you wern't without one about you, &s;ays
I&mdash;! don't think, &s;ays I, Mrs. Arnold, but your
&s;oul was de&s;ign'd for a hen, originally;&endq; &startq;Why,
and If I <HI>had</HI> been a hen, &s;ays &s;he, I believe I &s;hould
have done as much for my chickens as yonder
great black-and-white hen does, tho' I &s;ay't that
&s;hou'd not &s;ay't, &s;aid &s;he.&endq; Aye, that you would,

&startq;No, &s;ays &s;he, I doubt there is ne'er-a-one.&endq;
&startq;Well, &s;ays I, Mrs. Arnold, you and your chicken

I &s;at down, and wrote thus far: &s;crattle, &s;crattle,
goes the pen&mdash;why how now? &s;ays I&mdash;what's the
matter with the pen? So I thought I would make an
end of my letter, becau&s;e, my pen went &s;crattle, &s;crat|tle.
Well, I warrant I &s;hall have little plea&s;ure
when Mr. Jago <HI>comes;</HI> for I never, fixed my heart

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE>
<DATE>1739.</DATE></OPENER>
<P>I CANNOT avoid imagining the fir&s;t part of your
letter was mere raillery. I am &s;ure it gave me
a good deal of plea&s;ure (for I can bear very well to
hear my foibles expo&s;ed, though not my faults), and
on that account mu&s;t needs make grateful mention
of it. I acknowledge the oddne&s;s of the letter which
occa&s;ioned it, and could not expect that &s;uch an ill-formed
application could have produced an an&s;wer
&s;o very oratorical. In the fir&s;t place, you lay open
the &s;ubject, or indeed, what you call the offices in
which I am plea&s;ed to employ you. In the next,
you alledge your own inability to enter upon mat|ters
of &s;uch great concernment. That this is rhe|torical,
nay, pure rhetoric, I gather from the, e$|ordiams
of all the declamations that I ever heard in
my life. 'Tis, moreover, not uncommon with de|claimers
to give &s;ome rea&s;ons why they &s;hould not
ab&s;olutely-decline the &s;ubject, though they are &s;en|&s;ible
<PB N="7" REF="14">
of their in&s;ufficiency (otherwi&s;e they might be
expected to &s;it down, and hold their tongues). And
this is what you have done, by &s;aying that you are
unwilling to di&s;&s;ent from the world in regard to the
&s;ubjects you are engaged in; that you, therefore,
cho&s;e to &s;teer a middle cour&s;e, by that means avoid|ing
the imputation of pre&s;umption on the one hand,
and indifference on the other. When this is done,
you enter gravely upon the &s;ubject, and, to give it a
greater per&s;picuity, divide it into two parts. The
fir&s;t part happens to be &startq;concerning the purcha&s;e of
<HI>an</HI> hor&s;e,&endq; On this occa&s;ion, you inform me, that
I am in a good country for hor&s;es; and &s;econdly, that
I have a number of acquaintance round about me,
who are very well &s;killed in the nature of them. Now
each of the&s;e informations &s;eems, at fir&s;t &s;ight, to
mean no more than what I have better opportunities
of knowing than the per&s;on who informs me, and, on
this account, to err in point of &s;uperfluity. But,
upon &s;econd thoughts, they have <HI>this force</HI> (to &s;peak
like a grammarian); namely, that I am entirely
negligent of my own affairs; and, &s;econdly, that I
care not whom I give trouble to, if I can but avoid
it my&s;elf; &s;o that the &s;entences have really a beauty,
when one &s;earches beneath their &s;uperficies. After
you have &s;aid this and more, which includes all that
can be &s;aid upon the &s;ubject, you de&s;cend to the &s;e|cond divi&s;ion, in relation to which I am too grateful
to be otherwi&s;e than <HI>&s;erious</HI> in my acknowledge|ments.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="15">
I HAD not expatiated thus far, but to &s;hew that I
am not in&s;en&s;ible of a fneer; nor &s;hould I expatiate
any farther, but to prove that I am equally &s;en&s;ible of
a &s;avour.</P>
<P>I DESIRE you would believe, that I ab&s;olutely a&s;|&s;ent
to your critique: That &s;ome of your &s;entiments
were my own before I communicated the ver&s;es; and
others, as &s;oon as you had favoured me with the di&s;|covery
of them: That I would, <HI>per prae&s;entes,</HI> return
my thanks for them; which you might ju&s;tly have
claimed, whether I had approved them or not. One
exception to this approbation my mode&s;ty bids me
mention, on account of your too great partiality in
my favour. My gratitude you are entitled to with|out
exception or limitation.</P>
<P>IT will, perhaps, gratify your curio&s;ity to know,
that Mr. G. has a copy of ver&s;es in the la&s;t maga|zine,
entitled, &startq;The little Cur.&endq; There are &s;everal
$$rokes that are picture&s;que and humourous; I be|lieve
it was done in ha&s;te. The motto is exequi&s;ite,
and much more properly applied by Mr. G. than
the Emperor Adrian, in my opinion, notwith&s;tanding
all that Pope &s;ays. Tell me your judgement of Mr.
L&mdash;n's in the &s;ame paper. The epigram &startq;To
one who refu&s;ed to walk in the Park, &amp;c.&endq; is a
good one.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="16">
I HAVE waved &s;ending the ver&s;es to Mr. Somervile
at pre&s;ent, becau&s;e I hope to &s;ee you &s;oon either at
The Lea&s;owes or at Birmingham. I cannot tell whether
I &s;hall have time to inclo&s;e in this letter my ballad.
If I do, con&s;ider it only as &s;ome words that I chu&s;e
to make u&s;e of to &s;ome notes of which I am more than
ordinarily fond<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">The tune &startq;Come, and li&s;ten to my ditty, &amp;c.&endq; The words founded upon a true hi&s;tory of Queen Elizabeth, who, looking from a ca&s;tle wherein &s;he was a pri&s;oner, and &s;eeing a country milk-maid &s;inging, expre&s;&s;ed great envy at the girl's condition, and di&s;&s;atisfaction with regard to her own.</NOTE>. It is as much de&s;igned for my
own &s;inging (in private I mean) as ever was a bottle
of cherry-brandy for an old woman's drinking.
Now I think of it, I really believe that I every day
approach nearer and nearer to the capacity, the way,
the in&s;ignificancy, of an old woman. Mrs. Arnold
has certainly, by her <HI>charms,</HI> her incantations, and
her conver&s;ations together, contributed a good deal
to this transformation. Pray come over if you can,
and try to rein&s;tate me in my right mind, in propor|tion

<HEAD>V. To a Friend, from London, de&s;cribing his Tem|per,

<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE>
From Mr. Wintle's, Per|fumer,
near Temple-Bar,
&amp;c. <DATE>6th Feb. 1740.</DATE></OPENER>
<P>I AM now with regard to the <HI>town</HI> pretty much
in the &s;ame &s;tate in which I expect to be always
with regard to the <HI>world;</HI> &s;ometimes exclaiming and
railing again&s;t it; &s;ometimes giving it a good word,
and even admiring it. A &s;un-&s;hiny day, a tavern|&s;upper
after a play well acted, and now and then
an invigorating breath of air in the Mall, never fail
of producing a chearful effect. I don't know whe|ther
I gave you any account of Quin's acting Fal|&s;taff
in my former letter: I really imagined that I
&s;aw you tittering on one &s;ide me, &s;haking your &s;ides,
and &s;ometimes &s;carce containing your&s;elf. You will
<PB N="13" REF="20">
pardon the attitude in which I placed you, &s;ince it
was what &s;eemed <HI>natural</HI> at that circum&s;tance of time.
&mdash;Comus I have once been at, for the &s;ake of the
&s;ongs, though I dete&s;t it in any <HI>light:</HI> but as a <HI>dra|matic</HI>
piece, the <HI>taking</HI> of it &s;eems a <HI>prodigy;</HI> yet in|deed
<HI>&s;uch-a-one,</HI> as was pretty tolerably accounted for
by a gentleman who &s;at by me in the <HI>boxes.</HI> This
learned &s;age, being a&s;ked how he liked the play, made
an&s;wer, &startq;He could not tell&mdash;pretty well, he thought
&mdash;or indeed as well as any other play&mdash;he always
took it, that people only came there to &s;ee and to
be &s;een&mdash;for as for what was &s;aid, he owned,
he never under&s;tood any thing of the matter.&endq;
I told him, I thought a great many of its admirers
were in his ca&s;e, if they would but own it.</P>
<P>ON the other hand, it is amazing to con&s;ider to
what an univer&s;ality of learning people make pre|ten&s;ions
here. There's not a drawer, a chair or hack|ney
coach-man, but is politician, poet, and judge of
polite literature. Chimney-&s;weepers damn the Con|vention,
and black-&s;hoe-boys cry up the Genius of
Shake&s;pear. &startq;The Danger of writing Ver&s;e&endq; is a
very good thing; if you have not read it, I would
recommend it to you as poetical. But now I talk
of Learning, I mu&s;t not omit an interview which I
accidentally had the other night in company with
Lord D&mdash;and one Mr. C&mdash;. We were taken to &s;up
at a private hou&s;e, where I found a per&s;on whom I
had never &s;een before. The man behaved exceeding
<PB N="14" REF="21">
mode&s;tly and well; till, growing a little merry over
a bottle (and being a little countenanced by the
&s;ubject we were upon), he pulls out of his pocket
about half a dozen ballads, and di&s;tributes them
among&s;t the company. I (not finding at fir&s;t they
were of his own compo&s;ition) read one over, and,
finding it a dull piece of &s;tuff, contented my&s;elf with
ob&s;erving that it was exceedingly well <HI>printed.</HI> But
to &s;ee the man's face on this occa&s;ion would make
you pity the circum&s;tance of an author as long as you
live. His jollity cea&s;ed (as a flame would do, &s;hould
you pour water upon it); and, I believe, for about
five minutes, he &s;poke not a &s;yllable. At length,
recovering him&s;elf, he began to talk about his coun|try-&s;eat,
about Houghton-Hall, and &s;oon after de|&s;ired
a health, imagining (as I found afterwards) that
Lord D&mdash;would have given Sir Robert's. But he did
not, naming Sir T&mdash;L&mdash;: mine, which followed,
was that of Mr. L&mdash;. Now, who do you think this
&s;hould be, but hone&s;t Ralph Freeman (at lea&s;t the
writer of the paper &s;o &s;ub&s;cribed), your father's old
friend and intimate, Sir Robert's right-hand, a per|&s;on
that lives elegantly, drives &s;ix of the be&s;t hor&s;es
in town, and plays on St. John's organ: (you know
Mr. L&mdash;is not only Sir Robert's greate&s;t enemy, but
the Gazetteer's proper antagoni&s;t.) We were invited
to &s;ee him very civilly, and indeed the man behaved
with the utmo&s;t good-humour, without arrogance, or
any attempts at wit, which, probably, would not
<PB N="15" REF="22">
have been very &s;ucce&s;sful.&mdash;A&s;k your father what he
would &s;ay to me, if I &s;hould join in the cau&s;e with
his old friend, and take a good annuity under Sir
Robert, which, I believe, I might have; and little
encouragement, God knows, have I met with on the
other &s;ide of the que&s;tion. I &s;ay, I believe I <HI>might
have,</HI> becau&s;e I know a certain per&s;on gives pen&s;ions
of three pounds a-week to porters and the mo&s;t il|literate
&s;tupid fellows you can imagine, to talk in
his behalf at ale-hou&s;es: where they &s;it &s;o long a
time, and are as regularly relieved as one centry re|lieves
another.&mdash;At lea&s;t tell him that I expect in
his an&s;wer to my letter (which I &s;hall not allow him
to a&s;&s;ign to you), he write &s;omething to confirm me
in my integrity, and to make me prefer him, and
you, and hone&s;ty, to lace, brocade, and the &s;miles of
the ladies,
<Q>&startq;Et Veneri, &amp; cunis, &amp; plumis Sardanapali.&endq;</Q>
But I hope to keep my Hercules in view, whether
in print or manu&s;cript; and though I am as fond of
plea&s;ure as mo&s;t people, yet I &s;hall ob&s;erve the rule,
<Q>&startq;Po&s;itam &s;ic tangere noli.&endq;</Q></P>
<P>I DESIRE I may hear from you next po&s;t: I have

<P>IF I wi&s;h for a <HI>large</HI> fortune, it is rather for the

<P>DR. Ratcliff has &s;ent me a letter, which gives me

<P>WONDERFUL were the dangers and difficul|ties
through which I went, the night I left
you at Barels: which I looked upon as ordained by
fate for the temporal punl&s;hment of ob&s;tinacy. It
was very kind, and in character, for you to endea|vour
to deter me from the ways of darkne&s;s; but

have an undoubted right to indulge my&s;elf in them,

they &s;hould be <HI>lenia tormenta;</HI> and I mu&s;t own the
labours I underwent that night did not come with|in
the bounds which my imagination had pre&s;cribed.
I cannot forbear mentioning one imminent danger.
I rode along a con&s;iderable piece of water, covered &s;o
clo&s;e with trees, that it was as probable I might
have pur&s;ued the channel, which was dangerous, as
my way out of it. Or, to put my ca&s;e in a more
poetical light, having by night intruded upon an
amour betwixt a Wood-nymph and a River-god, I
owed my e&s;cape to Fortune, who conveyed me from
the vengeance which they might have taken. I put
up finally at a little alehou&s;e about ten o'clock, and
lay all night awake, counting the cords which &s;up|ported
me, which I could more &s;afely &s;wear to than

I do not wonder he plea&s;ed extremely; but to a

An Athenian audience would have &s;hewn their

<P>I THANK you for the favour of your la&s;t letter,
particularly your readine&s;s in tran&s;mitting to me
any thing of Mr. Somervile's. It &s;o fell out, that
<PB N="26" REF="33">
Mr. Outing delivered to me the ver&s;es, and I had
the plea&s;ure of reading them, about a moment before
he gave me your epi&s;tle.</P>
<P>THE town expected &s;omething of importance, name|ly,
a motion for a committee of enquiry into late
mea&s;ures, would be moved for to-day. If any thing
of this nature has been carrying on, I will add an
account of it before I clo&s;e my letter. In the mean
time it is, I believe, very credible, that Lord Or&s;ord
has a continued influence over the King; and that
the Duke of Argyle is &s;ufficiently di&s;gu&s;ted, to have
talked of the re&s;ignation of his po&s;ts again.</P>
<P>AN odd &s;tory enough the following, and I believe
true! Somebody, that had ju&s;t learnt that H&mdash;e W&mdash;'s
gentleman's name was Jack&s;on, writes a letter to Mr.
Floyer, Keeper of the Tower, intimating his ma&s;ter's
de&s;ire to &s;peak with him. Floyer dre&s;&s;es the next
morning, and waits upon H&mdash;e, comes into his
room&mdash;&startq;Sir, &s;ays H&mdash;e, I really dont't know
you&mdash;&endq; &startq;Sir, my name is Floyer&mdash;&endq; &startq;Ay, by

you for all that&mdash;&endq; &startq;Sir, &s;ays he, I am Keeper of

<P>&startq;YOUR la&s;t letter gave me a good deal of unea&s;i|ne&s;s
in regard to Mr. Somervile's indi&s;po&s;ition.
I hope, if he is better, you will omit no opportunity
of gratifying me with the news of it. I &s;hall be glad
to employ you and Mr. Jago in my little rivulet be|fore
winter comes, when one mu&s;t bid adieu to ru|ral
beauties. Tho&s;e charming &s;cenes, which the
poets, in order to render them more compleat, have
furni&s;hed with ladies, mu&s;t be &s;tript of all their or|naments.
Tho&s;e incomparable nymphs, the Dryads
and the Nereids, which have been my con&s;tant com|panions
this &s;hort &s;ummer, will vani&s;h to more plea&s;|ing
<PB N="28" REF="35">
climes; and I mu&s;t be left to &s;eek my a&s;&s;i&s;tace
in real beauties in&s;tead of imaginary ones. In &s;hort,
I am thinking to live part of this winter in Worce&s;ter,
or &s;ome other town. I was at a concert there, a very
full one, lately. I ob&s;erved Dr. Mackenzie talking
to Mr. Lyttelton; and I hope, on that account, he
is in his intere&s;t: otherwi&s;e Mr. Somervile would
do Mr. Lyttelton great &s;ervice by engaging him.&mdash;
Mr. Lyttelton took occa&s;ion to mention to me the
obligation he lay under to Mr. Somervile for his let|ter,
as well as his other de&s;igns in his favour&mdash;that
he had long received great plea&s;ure from that gentle|man's
pen, and wi&s;hed for the honour of his ac|quaintance.
I told him, I believed the &s;atisfaction
would be mutual, or to that purpo&s;e. He added,
that The Chace was an <HI>extremely</HI> beautiful poem, the
be&s;t by far ever written on the &s;ubject. But now
the fiddles &s;queaked, the harp&s;ichord jingled, and the
performers began to feel the divine enthu&s;ia&s;m. The
god of mu&s;ic invaded them as he did the Sibyll of
old:

<DATE>Jan. 21, 1741.</DATE></OPENER>
<P>YOU &s;ee I am <HI>extremely expeditious</HI> in an&s;wering
your letter; the rea&s;on of which is a very pow|erful
one, namely, the information which I received
ta&s;t night, that it would be agreeable to you I &s;hould
do &s;o. Plea&s;e therefore to &s;et a&s;ide the &s;um of
eighteen pence, or thereabouts, for letters which
you will receive whil&s;t I am in London; and, to
make it &s;eem the le&s;s profu&s;ely &s;quandered, con&s;ider
it among&s;t any other ca&s;ual expences which you care|le&s;sly
&s;ubmit to, merely to gratify your curio&s;ity.</P>
<P>I WENT the other night, with the greate&s;t expecta|tions,
to &s;ee &startq;The Merry Wives of Wind&s;or&endq; per|formed
at Covent-Garden. It is impo&s;&s;ible to expre&s;s
how much every thing fell below my ideas. But I
have <HI>con&s;idered &s;ence;</HI> and I find that my expectations
were really more unju&s;t than their manner of acting.
<PB N="30" REF="37">
<HI>Per&s;ons,</HI> in order to act well, &s;hould have &s;omething
of the author's fire, as well as a polite education.
And what makes this the clearer to me is, that you
hear ten plays well read by gentlemen in company,
to one that you find well performed upon the &s;tage.&mdash;
Nothing can be more ignorant or affected than the
&s;cornful airs which &s;ome people give them&s;elves at a
country play; becau&s;e, for&s;ooth, they have &s;een plays
in town. The truth is, the chief advantage of plays
in town lies entirely in the &s;cenery. You &s;eldom
ob&s;erve a &s;et of &s;trollers without one or two actors
who are quite equal to their parts; and I really
know of no good one at either of the two Theatres
Royal, except Cibber who rarely acts, and Mrs.
Clive. I will add one more, in <HI>compliance</HI> with my
<HI>own</HI> ta&s;te <HI>merely;</HI> and that is Mr. Neal, a fellow who,
by <HI>playing the fool,</HI> has gained my particular <HI>e&s;teem.</HI></P>
<P>AFTER the play, we had an <HI>entertainment;</HI> fal&s;ely
&s;o called! It was that of Orpheus and Eurydice, the
mo&s;t <HI>un-mu&s;ical</HI> thing I ever heard, and which la&s;ted,
I believe, three hours, with &s;ome intermixtures of
Harlequin; both &s;o dull, and yet heard with pa|tience,
that I was amazed, a&s;toni&s;hed, confounded:
but really a <HI>man</HI> of <HI>&s;en&s;e</HI> ought not to be &s;o; becau&s;e
they were not calculated for <HI>him.</HI></P>
<P>I WANT you here extremely: pray come up for a
week. I &s;uppo&s;e you will not, &s;o I will not argue

<P>AS I have no &s;ort of library in town, I find &s;e|veral
minutes upon my hands, for which, if
I employ them in &s;cribbling to my friends, they are
but <HI>&s;lenderly obliged</HI> to me. I hope no friend of mine
will ever be induced, by my <HI>example,</HI> to do any thing
but avoid it; I believe no one breathing can &s;ay with
more truth, &startq;Video meliora, &amp;c.&endq; It is not from a
&s;pirit of jealou&s;y that I would advi&s;e my acquaintance
to &s;eek happine&s;s in the regular path of a fixed life.
But, though I very highly approve it, and envy it,
my particular turn of mind would be as little &s;atisfied
with it as it is like to be in a <HI>different</HI> one. Yet,
however I <HI>complain,</HI> I mu&s;t own I have a good deal
reconciled my&s;elf to this mixture of gratification and
di&s;appointment, which mu&s;t be my lot till the la&s;t
totally prevails.</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="39">
YET, after all, to tell you the truth, I am not plea&s;ed
with being advi&s;ed to retire. I was &s;aying the other
day to Mr. Outing, that I <HI>had</HI> been ambitious more
than I was at pre&s;ent, and that I grew le&s;s &s;o every
day. Upon this he chimed in with me, and approved
my de&s;pondency; &s;aying, &startq;that <HI>he</HI> al&s;o had been am|bitious,
but found it would not do.&endq; Do you
think I liked him much for this?&mdash;no&mdash;I wheeled
about, and &s;aid, &startq;I did not think with him; for I
&s;hould always find my&s;elf whetted by di&s;appoint|ments,

of the game.&endq; I &s;pent a night with him and
Mr. Meredith, and with him and Mr. Dean: in the
latter party he had laid his hand upon his &s;word &s;ix
times, and <HI>threatened to put a dozen men to death,</HI> one of
which was Broughton the prize-fighter.&mdash;Mr. Whi&s;t|ler's
company &s;eldom <HI>relieves</HI> me on an evening; and
I go to plays but <HI>&s;eldom,</HI> becau&s;e I intend no more to
<HI>give countenance</HI> to the <HI>pit.</HI>&mdash;I have got a belt!!!
which di&s;tingui&s;hes me as much as a <HI>garter</HI>&mdash;it capti|vates
the eyes of all beholders, and binds their under|&s;tandings
in golden bandage.&mdash;I heard a pedant pun|ning
upon the word <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">; and a wag whi&s;pering
that I was related to <HI>Belti&s;hazzar.</HI> In &s;hort I may &s;ay,

<P>I WRITE to you out of the abundant inclination
I have to hear from you; imagining that, as you

circum&s;tances. The chief aver&s;ion which &s;ome peo|ple
have to orders is, what I fancy you will remove
in &s;uch as you conver&s;e with. I take it to be owing
partly to dre&s;s, and partly to the <HI>avowed profe&s;&s;ion</HI> of
religion. A young clergyman, that has di&s;tingui&s;hed

<HI>&s;hining</HI> in a dark-coloured coat.&mdash;You mu&s;t con&s;ider
me yet as a man of the world, and endeavouring to

how &s;tupid I have been ever &s;ince I came home, in&s;o|much
that I cannot write a common letter without
&s;ix repetitions. This is the third time I have begun
yours, and you &s;ee what &s;tuff it is made up of. I

I have nothing to <HI>communicate.</HI> But I would be glad to
know, whether you are under a nece&s;&s;ity of re&s;iding
on week-days; and, if not, why I may not expect you
a day or two at The Lea&s;owes very &s;oon.&mdash;Did you
make any enquiry concerning the number of my

any farther than as a laugh is an indication
that people are delighted. This, joined with his

The Lea&s;owes, <DATE>Sept. 23, 1741.</DATE></OPENER>
<P>I WAS very agreeably entertained by your la&s;t let|ter,
as indeed I am by every one of yours. It
were affectation to except a paragraph or two on ac|count
of partiality, where, to &s;ay the truth, the par|tiality
it&s;elf plea&s;es one. This I am very po&s;itive
of, that to have a friend of your temper and ta&s;te
will always give me plea&s;ure, whether I plea&s;e the
world or no; but to plea&s;e ever &s;o much, without
&s;ome &s;uch friend&s;hip, would in all probability &s;ig|nify
but little. I &s;hall, therefore, value any means
that tend to confirm my opinion of your e&s;teem for
me, preferably to any that &s;hew me I am merely de|&s;erving
<PB N="36" REF="43">
of it. After all, though a very limited num|ber
of <HI>friends</HI> may be &s;ufficient, an idle per&s;on &s;hould
have a large <HI>acquaintance;</HI> and I believe I have the
lea&s;t of any one that ever rambled about &s;o much as
I have done. I do not know how it is, but I ab&s;o|lutely
de&s;pair of ever being introduced into the
world. It may be objected by &s;ome (but you will
not object it), that I may be acquainted with a &s;uf|ficient
number of people that are my <HI>equals,</HI> if I <HI>will</HI>
They may be my <HI>equals</HI> and <HI>&s;uperiors</HI> whom they
mean, &s;or aught I care; but their conver&s;ation gives
me no more plea&s;ure than the <HI>canking</HI> of a goo&s;e, or
the quacking of a duck, in affluent circum&s;tances:
rather <HI>le&s;s</HI> indeed of the two, becau&s;e the idea of the
fat goo&s;e flatters one's appetite; but the <HI>human goo&s;e</HI>
is neither fit to be heard nor eaten. I wi&s;h indeed
to be <HI>&s;hewn into</HI> good company; but, if I can at all
di&s;tingui&s;h the nature of my inclinations, it is more
in hopes of meeting with a refined conver&s;ation, than
any thing el&s;e. I do not at all in&s;i&s;t that my genius
is <HI>better</HI> than that of my vociferous neighbours; if
it is <HI>different,</HI> it is a &s;ufficient rea&s;on why I &s;hould
&s;eek &s;uch companions as &s;uit it; and whether they
are found in high or low life, is little to the pur|po&s;e.
But you will perhaps di&s;cern the operations
of <HI>vanity</HI> in all my endeavours; I will not di&s;agree
with you, provided you will allow <HI>amu&s;ement</HI> an equal
&s;hare in them. It is the vanity to be intimate with
men of di&s;tingui&s;hed &s;en&s;e, not of di&s;tingui&s;hed for|tune.
<PB N="37" REF="44">
And this is a vanity which you &s;hould not
di&s;approve, becau&s;e it will bind me a la&s;ting friend to
you and your family.</P>
<P>I HAVE been over at Shis$hall, and, in order to

I confe&s;s I was &s;omewhat diverted; and my hor&s;e

to turn &s;port&s;man, I &s;hould &s;oon break my neck for
&s;ear the hunt&s;man &s;ould de&s;pi&s;e me.</P>
<P>I WILL certainly endeavour to &s;ee you at Birming|ham;

the mean time: and contrive, if you can, to make it
look like a packet as your la&s;t did, for the &s;ight
thereof is exceedingly comfortable.</P>
<P>THOUGH my wi&s;hes will not &s;uffer me to believe

<P>YOU mu&s;t give me leave to complain of your la&s;t
letter, three parts of which is filled with mere
apology: I thought we had &s;ome time agreed, for our
mutual emolument, to lay a&s;ide ceremonies of this
&s;pecies, till I was made Poet-laureat, and you Bi&s;hop
of Winche&s;ter.&mdash;Why Bi&s;hop of Winche&s;&s;ter, for God's
&s;ake? Why&mdash;becaus;e&mdash;he is Prelate of the Garter&mdash;
an order, in all kinds of ceremony &s;o greatly abound|ing.&mdash;
Here am I &s;till, trifling away my time, my mo|ney,
and, I think, my health, which I fancy greatly
inferior to what it would be in the country. Truth
is, I do make &s;hift to vary my days a little here; and,
calling to mind the many irk&s;ome hours, the &s;tupid
identity, of which I have been &s;o often &s;ick in the
country, I conclude that I am le&s;s <HI>unhappy</HI> than I &s;hall
find my&s;elt a: home.&mdash;However, next month I hope
to &s;ee The Lea&s;owes with an appetite.&mdash;Walks in the

&mdash;Mr. Outing, the la&s;t time I &s;aw him, told me how
Dr. Mackenzie cured him of ever fighting with &s;crubs,

<P>MR. A&mdash;was honourably acquitted: Lord A&mdash;,
who was pre&s;ent, and behaved very in&s;olently they
&s;ay, was hi&s;&s;ed out of court. They proved his ap|plication

<P>I CANNOT forbear immediately writing to you:
the plea&s;ure you la&s;t letter gave me put it out of

<HI>&s;i fort attendri,</HI> that I could not bear any re&s;traint upon
my ability to &s;hew my gratitude. It is an ob&s;ervation
I made upon reading to-day's paper, which contains
an account of C. Khevenhuller's &s;ucce&s;s in favour of

<PB N="52" REF="59">

all the time you and I &s;hall enjoy together, ab&s;tract|ed

perhaps amount to a $olid year and a half. How
$mall a proportion!</P>
<P>PEOPLS will &s;ay to one that talks thus, &startq;Would
you die?&endq; To &s;et the ca&s;e upon a right footing,
they mu&s;t take away the hopes of greater happine&s;s

together with the bodily <HI>pain</HI> of dying, and addre&s;s
me in a di&s;po&s;ition betwixt mirth and melancholy;
and I could ea&s;ily re&s;olve them.</P>
<P>I DO not know how I am launched out &s;o far into

whining; the effect of the wind&mdash;did it come
from the winds? to the winds will I deliver it:

namely, an inclination to be witty, yet I a&s;&s;ure you
it was not any punctilious con&s;ideration of that kind
that has kept me &s;o long &s;ilent. Indeed with &s;ome
people one would &s;tand upon the nice&s;t punctilios;
for though ceremony be altogether lighter than vanity
it&s;elf, yet it &s;urely weighs as much as the acquain|tance
of the unde&s;erving. But this is trifling, be|cau&s;e
it can have no reference to a per&s;on for whom
I have the greate&s;t affection.</P>
<P>IN regard to my Oxford affairs, you did all I could
expect. I have wrote &s;ince to Mr. M&mdash;, who, ei|ther
for your &s;ake or mine, will, I dare &s;ay, &s;ettle
them to my &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P><PB N="55" REF="62">
I WISH your journey and head-ach would have
permitted you to have been a little more particular
concerning the &s;eat of the Mu&s;es; but I &s;uppo&s;e no|thing

<P>MR. Whi&s;tler has relap&s;ed at Whitchurch; but
purpo&s;ed, when I la&s;t heard from him, to go to
London before this time. I do not entirely under|&s;tand
his &s;chemes, but &s;hould have been &s;incerely
glad of his company with me this winter; and, he
&s;ays, he is not fond of London.&mdash;For my part, I
de&s;igned to go thither the next month, but the fever
(which is chiefly violent in towns) di&s;courages me.</P>
<P>SOME time ago, I read Spen&s;er's Fairy Queen;
and, when I had fini&s;hed, thought it a proper time
to make &s;ome additions and corrections in my trifling
imitation of him, The School-mi&s;tre&s;s.&mdash;His &s;ubject
is certainly bad, and his action inexpre&s;&s;ibly con|fu&s;ed;
but there are &s;ome particulars in him that
charm one. Tho&s;e which afford the greate&s;t &s;cope
for a ludicrous imitation are, his &s;implicity and ob|&s;olete
phra&s;e; and yet the&s;e are what give one a very
&s;ingular plea&s;ure in the peru&s;al. The burle&s;que
which they occa&s;ion is of quite a different kind to
that of Philips's Shilling, Cotton's Trave&s;tie, Hudi|bras,
or Swift's works; but I need not tell <HI>you</HI> this.
I inclo&s;e a copy, for your amu&s;ement and opinion;
<PB N="56" REF="63">
which, if franks are plentiful, you may return, and
&s;ave me the <HI>tedious</HI> trouble of writing it over again.
The other paper was, <HI>bona fide,</HI> written to divert my

actions equally reputable.</P>
<P>MR. Somervile's poem, upon hawking, called,
&startq;Field Sports,&endq; I &s;uppo&s;e, is out by this time. It
was &s;ent to Mr. Lyttelton, to be read to the Prince, to
whom it was in&s;cribed. It &s;eems, he is fond of hawk|ing.</P>

<HEAD>XXIV. To the &s;ame, with a Continuation of the
&s;ame Subject.</HEAD>
<OPENER>Dear Mr. Graves!
<DATE>June, 1742.</DATE></OPENER>
<P>I AM glad the &s;tay you make in Hereford&s;hire
amu&s;es you, even though it puts you upon pre|ferring
the place you re&s;ide at to my own place of
re&s;idence. I do not know whether it be from the
prejudice of being born at The Lea&s;owes, or from
any real beauty in the &s;ituation; but I would wi&s;h
no other, would &s;ome one, by an addition of two
hundred pounds a year, put it in my power to ex|hibit
my own de&s;igns. It is what I can now do in
no other method than on paper. I live in &s;uch an
un-oeconomical manner, that I mu&s;t not indulge my|&s;elf
in the plantation of a tree for the future. I
have glutted my&s;elf with the extremity of &s;olitude,
and mu&s;t adapt my expences more to &s;ociable life.
It is on this account that it &s;eems more prudent for
me to buy a chair while I am in town, than to carry
down twelve guineas for the model of the tomb of
Virgil, an urn, and a &s;cheme or two more of like
nature.&mdash;I long to have my picture, <HI>di&s;tantly</HI> approach|ing
to a profile (the be&s;t manner I can think of to
expre&s;s my&s;elf), drawn by Davi&s;on. I have &s;een
your &s;i&s;ter's, and think the <HI>face</HI> well done in every
re&s;pect; but am greatly indignant with other things
of a le&s;s fixed nature. The cap, though a good cap
<PB N="58" REF="65">
enough, has a vile effect; the formality of &s;tays, &amp;c.
not agreeable.&mdash;I do not know if you &s;aw the picture
of a Scotch girl there at full length? Mi&s;s Graves
has the advantage of her's, or any picture there,
in her per&s;on; but certainly this girl's hair is in|expre&s;&s;ibly
charming! there is the genteele&s;t neg|ligence
in it I ever &s;aw in any picture:&mdash;what fol|lows,
but that I wi&s;h your &s;i&s;ter would give orders
to pull off her cap, and have hair after the manner
of this picture?&mdash;To &s;peak abruptly; as it <HI>is,</HI> I di&s;|approve
it: were it altered, I &s;hould like it beyond
any I ever &s;aw.&mdash;I am glad you are reading Spen|&s;er:
though his plan is dete&s;table, and his <HI>invention</HI>
le&s;s wonderful than mo&s;t people imagine, who do not
much con&s;ider the obviou&s;ne&s;s of allegory; yet, I
think, a per&s;on of your di&s;po&s;ition mu&s;t take great
delight in his <HI>&s;implicity,</HI> his good-nature, &amp;c. Did
you ob&s;erve a &s;tanza that begins a canto &s;omewhere,</P>
<P>&startq;Nought is there under heav'n's wide hollowne&s;s
That breeds,&endq;&amp;c.?</P>
<P>WHEN I bought him fir&s;t, I read a page or two
of the Fairy Queen, and cared not to proceed. Af|ter
that, Pope's Alley made me con&s;ider him lu|dicrou&s;ly;
and in that light, I think, one may read
him with plea&s;ure. I am now (as Ch&mdash;mley with&mdash;),
from trifling and laughing at him, really in love
with him. I think even the metre pretty (though
<PB N="59" REF="66">
I &s;hall never u&s;e it in earne&s;t); and that the la&s;t Alex|andrine
has an extreme maje&s;ty.&mdash;Does not this line
&s;trike you? (I do not ju&s;tly remember what canto it is

<P>PRESUMING you may be at Ti&s;&s;ington by this

you in your travels; and will <HI>equally</HI> affect
me as they relate to you. Above all things, be par|ticular
in regard to your calculations re&s;pecting Mi$|kleton.
I would have certainly met you there, as
you de&s;ired me: there is no company I am fonder
of than yours and your &s;i&s;ter's; and no place at
which I have &s;pent more agreeable hours than Mic|kleton.
But your brother has lo&s;t one of his recom|mendations
in my eye; that is, his <HI>irregularity</HI> of
hou&s;e-keeping. He has &s;everal left which are &s;uf|ficient
to pre&s;erve my utmo&s;t e&s;teem; but that was
a jewel indeed! I love to go where there is nothing

incon&s;i&s;tency in my equipage. But where a
con&s;iderable family keeps up its forms (as marriage
requires), I &s;hould not care to appear with an hired
hor&s;e, and a <HI>Sancho</HI> for my valet. The ca&s;e is, I
<HI>could</HI> live in a way genteel enough, and uniformly

not to appear of a piece; yet that <HI>infrequent</HI>
pain is not a balance for the &s;ub&s;tantial happine&s;s
which I find in an urn, a &s;eal, a &s;nuff-box, an engrav|ing,
or a bu&s;t. Ambition, too, as it puts me upon
wi&s;hing to make a figure, makes me very indifferent
as to making a common every-day-gentlemanly
figure; and &s;aves me from appearing &s;olicitous a|bout
the &startq;$es <HI>mediocriter</HI> &s;plendidae,&endq; by rai&s;ing my

in cataracts; but I hope you will rather con&s;ider
it as a mark of my <HI>confidence,</HI> and, con&s;equently, my
&s;incere e&s;teem and affection: for, I take it, the for|mer
&s;eldom &s;ub&s;i&s;ts without the latter. And as to
what I &s;aid about my love of flattery, I hope, you
will not con&s;true it as. any <HI>hint;</HI> neither, if I am
right, would you be &s;o ungenerous as to comply
with me. I &s;incerely think that flattery among&s;t
foes is ab&s;olutely de&s;irable; among&s;t one's <HI>common

among&s;t <HI>friends,</HI> its con&s;equences are of too dangerous
a nature.</P>

<OPENER>Dear Mr. Graves,
<DATE>1743.</DATE></OPENER>
<P>DR. Swift would not have &s;crupled to print your
parody, with his name to it. Why &s;hould you,
<HI>without</HI> your name? I had a violent inclination to
print it in a large folio, four leaves, price four|pence:
but I dare not do it, for fear you &s;hould
think it of evil importance with regard to the clergy.
You excell me infinitely in a way in which I take
mo&s;t plea&s;ure; odd picture&s;que de&s;cription. Send
me word whether I &s;hall print it or no&mdash;and that
right &s;oon.&mdash;I have lingered in town till now, and
did not receive your letter till this morning.&mdash;I do
not know whether I &s;hall &s;end you with this letter a
little thing which I wrote in an afternoon, and, with
proper <HI>demands</HI> of being concealed as the author, &s;old
for two guineas. Next time I am in town, I will
get money like a haberda&s;her. I will amu&s;e my&s;elf
with finding out the people's weak &s;ide, and &s;o fur|ni&s;h
them with <HI>&s;uitable non&s;en&s;e.</HI>&mdash;I would have you
do the &s;ame.&mdash;Make your wit bear your charges. In|deed,
as to the little parody you &s;end, it would fix
your reputation with men of &s;en&s;e as much as (great|ly
more than) the whole tedious character of Par&s;on
Adams. I read it half a year ago; the week after
I came to town: but made Mr. Shuckburgh take it
again, imagining it altogether a very mean per|formance.&mdash;
<PB N="71" REF="78">
I liked a tenth part pretty well; but,
as Dryden &s;ays of Horace (unju&s;tly), he, &s;hews his
teeth without laughing: the greater part is <HI>unnatural</HI>
and <HI>unhumorous.</HI> It has &s;ome advocates; but, I ob|&s;erve,
tho&s;e not &s;uch as I ever e&s;teemed ta&s;ters.
Finally, what makes <HI>you endeavour</HI> to like it?</P>
<P>MY printer was preparing his bill for The School|mi&s;tre&s;s,
when I &s;topped him &s;hort, with a hint to
go to Dod&s;ley, who has not yet reckoned with me
for Hercules. Let <HI>the dead</HI> bury their <HI>dead.</HI> Dr.
Young's Complaint is the be&s;t thing that has come
out this &s;ea&s;on (the&s;e <HI>twenty years,</HI> Pope &s;ays) ex|cept
mine, for &s;o <HI>thinks</HI> every author, who does not
think proper to &s;ay &s;o: poor Pope's hi&s;tory in Cib|ber's
Letter, and the print of him upon the Mount
of Love (the <HI>coar&s;e&s;t</HI> is mo&s;t <HI>humorous</HI>), mu&s;t &s;urely
mortify him. Your &s;i&s;ter does me great honour to
think my hint any thing; but I am quite zealous
in my approbation of that Scotch lady's hair. I
will <HI>ever</HI> aim at <HI>oddne&s;s</HI> for the future; it is cheaper
to follow ta&s;te than fa&s;hion, and whoever he be that
devotes him&s;elf to <HI>ta&s;te</HI> will be <HI>odd</HI> of cour&s;e.&mdash;You
&s;end me the ver&s;es on Lord Ilay: they were hacked
about town three months ago, and I &s;aw them.
The town is certainly the &s;cene for a man of curio&s;i|ty.&mdash;
I do not purpo&s;e to be long away; but I mu&s;t
think of retrenching.&mdash;I have ten thou&s;and things
to tell you, but I have not room. Such people as
<PB N="72" REF="79">
<HI>we</HI> &s;hould meet as regularly to compare notes as
trade&s;men do to &s;ettle accounts, but oftener; there

ab&s;ence. Every one gets po&s;ts, preferments, but my|&s;elf.&mdash;
Nothing but my ambition can &s;et me on a

There is a now play acted at Drury

<HEAD>XXXII. To Mr. GRAVES, de&s;cribing his Situation,

<OPENER>Dear Mr. Graves,
The Leafowes.</OPENER>
<P>TO-MORROW morning I &s;et out for Chelten|ham,
to make trial of the waters there. I &s;hall,
perhaps, add to this letter at &s;everal &s;tages, and
conclude it at the place to which I am going; &s;o
that, like tho&s;e &s;prings, you may, perhaps, find it
impregnated with the nature of all tho&s;e places
through which it pa&s;&s;es; perhaps quite the con|trary.</P>
<P>&mdash;, if I mi&s;take not the man, is an encourager
of works of ta&s;te, &amp;c. though I am going to in|&s;tance
this oddly: he was a hearty &s;tickler for my
poem upon Hercules at Bath, as D. Jago &s;ent me
word. Perhaps it was complai&s;ance to Mr. Lyttel|ton,
with whom, Charles, &amp;c. he is intimate, if,
as I &s;aid before, I do not mi&s;take the per&s;on. I flat|ter
my&s;elf, I do not; and I hope that we two &s;hall
ever find the &s;ame per&s;ons, or the &s;ame kind of per|&s;ons,
our friends, and al&s;o our enemies.</P>
<P>IF I get over this ill habit of body, depend upon
it, I <HI>will</HI> have a <HI>reverend</HI> care of my health, as
Sir John Fal&s;taff advi&s;es the Chief Ju&s;tice. I &s;olve
all the tempe&s;ts that di&s;turb my con&s;titution into
<PB N="79" REF="88">
<HI>wind:</HI> it plagues me, fir&s;t, in the &s;hape of a bad
appetite, then indige&s;tion, then lowne&s;s of &s;pirits
and a flux of pale water, and at night by watchings,
re&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s, twitchings of my nerves, or a &s;leep more
di&s;tracted than the mo&s;t active &s;tate of watchfulne&s;s.
But I think purging le&s;&s;ens all the&s;e &s;ymptoms, and
I tru&s;t my &s;cheme that I am entering upon is right.</P>
<P>I WAS on Monday at Hagley, to wait on Mr.
Lyttelton, who was gone to Sir John A&s;tley's, to &s;ee
his grand edifice.&mdash;As to Mrs, Lyttelton, if her af|fability
is not artificial, I mean, if it does not owe
its original (as it <HI>ought to do</HI> its <HI>management</HI>) to art,
I cannot conceive a per&s;on more amiable;&mdash;but <HI>&s;en&s;e</HI>
and <HI>elegance</HI> cannot be feigned: to <HI>exhibit</HI> them, is
to <HI>have</HI> them.</P>
<P>How is my &s;ong &s;et? Mi&s;s Carrington procured
it that favour; but I have never &s;een a copy, nor knew
of its being to be printed. Howard has &s;et another
of mine, which I received la&s;t po&s;t; but my harp|&s;ichord
is out of order, and I have found no one yet
to explain the hieroglyphics which convey it. You
may probably find it in &s;ome future number of the
Briti&s;h Orpheus. &startq;By the &s;ide of a &s;tream, &amp;c.&endq;</P>
<P>I AM in as good &s;pirits this in&s;tant as ever I was
in my life: only &startq;Mens turbidum laetatur.&endq; My
head is a little confu&s;ed; but I often think &s;eriou&s;ly,
<PB N="80" REF="89">
that I ought to have the mo&s;t ardent and <HI>practical</HI>
gratitude (as the Methodi&s;ts chu&s;e to expre&s;s them|&s;elves)
for the advantages that I have: which, though
not eminently &s;hining, are &s;uch, to &s;peak the truth,
as &s;uit my particular humour, and con&s;equently
<HI>de&s;erve</HI> all kind of acknowledgement. If a poet
&s;hould addre&s;s him&s;elf to God Almighty, with the
mo&s;t earne&s;t thanks for his goodne&s;s in allotting him
an e&s;tate that was over-run with &s;hrubs, thickets,
and coppices, variegated with barren rocks and pre|cipices,
or floated three parts in four with lakes
and mar&s;hes, rather than &s;uch an equal and fertile
&s;pot as the &startq;&s;ons of men&endq; delight in; to my ap|prehen&s;ion,
he would be guilty of no ab&s;urdity.&mdash;
But of this I have compo&s;ed a kind of prayer, and
intend to write a little &s;peculation on the &s;ubject;
this kind of gratitude I a&s;&s;uredly ought to have,
and have. For my health, if one reflects, a coun|try-fellow's
&s;tock of it would be unfit for &s;olitude;
would di&s;po&s;e one rather to bodily feats, and, what
Fal&s;taff calls in Poins, <HI>gambol</HI> faculties, than mental
contemplations; and would give one that kind of
pain which &s;prings from <HI>impatience.</HI> My con&s;titution
was given me originally good; and with regard to
it now (as G. Barnwell &s;ays) &startq;What am I?&mdash;What

dizzy, and I never enterprize any &s;tudy of greater
&s;ubtlety than a news-paper. I cannot &s;ay the journey
to L&mdash;would be at all <HI>formidable</HI> to me; for I
ride about fifteen miles, as I compute it, every day
before dinner. But the nights from home would
be in&s;upportable to me. I have fatigued Mrs. Ar|nold's
a&s;&s;iduity, to the injury of her health; by oc|ca&s;ioning
her to &s;it in my room a'nights, light my
candle, put it out again, make me per&s;piratory
<PB N="84" REF="93">
wheys, and &s;lops; and am amu&s;ed by the mo&s;t &s;illy
animadver&s;ions &s;he is capable of making. I never
knew her u&s;efulne&s;s till now; but I <HI>now</HI> prefer her
to <HI>all of her station.</HI> If I get over this di&s;order, con|cerning
which I have bad apprehensions, you may
depend upon &s;eeing me the fir&s;t Sunday I dare ven|ture
forth. I hope <HI>you</HI> continue mending. The be|nefit
of <HI>riding</HI> is only not univer&s;al, and would cure
<HI>me</HI> too, could I but make one previous advance to|wards
health. Have you tried cold-bathing? Per|haps
it may not &s;uit your ca&s;e. I wi&s;h I had not
dropt it. I take my fluctuation of nerves to be
cau&s;ed, as that of the &s;ea is, by wind; which I am
continually pumping up, and yet find it &s;till renew|ed.
When I am ju&s;t &s;inking to &s;leep, a &s;udden
twitch of my nerves calls me back again&mdash;to watch|fulne&s;s
and vexation! I con&s;ider my&s;elf as in the
&s;tate of the philo&s;opher, who held a bullet betwixt
his finger and thumb, which, whenever he was about
to nod, was ordered &s;o as to fall into a large bra&s;s
pan, and wake him&mdash;that he might pur&s;ue his lucu|brations.</P>
<P>I WILL mention one circum&s;tance regarding the
weakne&s;s of my nerves;&mdash;and not my &s;pirits, for
I told you tho&s;e were tolerable:&mdash;the lea&s;t noi&s;e that
is, even the falling of a fire-&s;hovel upon the floor,
if it happen unexpectedly, &s;hocks my whole frame;
and I actually believe that a gun fired behind my
<PB N="85" REF="94">
back, unawares, amid&s;t the &s;tillne&s;s of the night,
would go near to kill me with its noi&s;e.</P>
<P>I AM ju&s;t going to bed; and dare not be any more
attentive, as I hope to clo&s;e my eyes for a minute.
So fare you well!</P>
<P>IT is now &s;ix o'clock in the morning, and I have
had about five hours middling &s;leep; which encou|rages
me greatly: &s;o I will <HI>hope</HI> to be able to &s;ee
you next Sunday &s;evennight.</P>
<P>WHAT think you of the battle? Are not you
&s;o much in love with our King, that you could find
in your heart to &s;erve him in any profitable po&s;t he
might a&s;&s;ign you?</P>
<P>CAPT. L&mdash;is wounded in the thigh.</P>
<P>WHEN I ride in my chair round my neighbour|hood,
I am as much &s;tared and wondered at, as a
giant would be that &s;hould walk through Pall-mall.
My vehicle is at <HI>least as</HI> uncommon hereabouts as
a blazing comet. My chief plea&s;ure lies in finding
out a thou&s;and roads, and delightful little haunts
near home, which I never dreamt of: egregious
&s;olitudes, and mo&s;t incomparable bye-lanes; where

<HEAD>XXXIV. To Mr. GRAVES, written in Hay-Harve&s;t.</HEAD>
<OPENER>Dear Mr. Graves,
<DATE>July 3, 1743.</DATE></OPENER>
<P>I DID not part from you without a <HI>great deal</HI> of
melancholy. To think of the <HI>&s;hort</HI> duration of
tho&s;e interviews which are the objects of one's <HI>con|tinual</HI>
wi&s;hes, has been a reflection that has plagued
me of old! I am &s;ure I returned home with it then,
more aggravated, as I fore&s;aw my&s;elf returning to
the &s;ame &s;eries of melancholy hours from which you
had a while relieved me, and which I had <HI>particularly</HI>
&s;uffered under all this la&s;t &s;pring! I wi&s;h to God,
you might happen to be &s;ettled not far from me:
a day's journey di&s;tance, however; I mean, an <HI>ea&s;y</HI>
one. But the odds are infinitely again&s;t me. I
mu&s;t only <HI>rely</HI> for my happine&s;s on the hopes of a
never-cea&s;ing corre&s;pondence!</P>
<P>SOON after you were gone, I received my packet.
The hi&s;tory of Worce&s;ter&s;hire is mere &s;tuff. T&mdash;
I am &s;o fond of, that, I believe, I &s;hall have his part
of the collection bound over again, neatly and &s;epa|rately.
But &s;ure Hammond has no right to the lea&s;t
<HI>inventive</HI> merit, as the preface-writer would in&s;inuate.
I do not think there is a &s;ingle thought, of any
eminence, that is not literally tran&s;lated. I am
a&s;toni&s;hed he could content him&s;elf with being &s;o lit|tle
an original.</P>
<P><PB N="87" REF="96">
MR Lyttelton and his lady are at Hagley. A
malignant caterpillar has demoli&s;hed the beauty of
all our <HI>large</HI> oaks. Mine are &s;ecured by their lit|tlene&s;s.
But, I gue&s;s, the park &s;uffers; a large wood
near me being a mere winter piece for nakedne&s;s.</P>
<P>AT pre&s;ent, I give my&s;elf up to riding and thought|le&s;&s;ne&s;s;
being re&s;olved to make trial of <HI>their</HI> efficacy
towards a tolerable degree of health and &s;pirits.
I wi&s;h I had you for my director. I &s;hould proceed
with great confidence of &s;ucce&s;s; though I am
brought very low by two or three fits of a fever
&s;ince I &s;aw you. Had I written to you in the mid&s;t
of my di&s;pirited condition, as I was going, you would
have had a more tender and unaffected letter than
I <HI>can</HI> write at another time: what I think, perhaps,
at all times; but what &s;ickne&s;s can alone elicit from
a temper fearful of whining.</P>
<P>SURELY the &startq;nunc formo&s;i&s;&s;imus annus&endq; is to be
limited to hay-harve&s;t. I could give my rea&s;ons: but
you will imagine them to be, the activity of country
people in a plea&s;ing employment; the full verdure
of the &s;ummer; the prime of pinks, woodbines, ja&s;|mines,
&amp;c. I am old; very old; for few things
give me &s;o much mechanical plea&s;ure as lolling on a
bank in the very heat of the &s;un,
<Q><L>&startq;When the old come forth to play</L>
<L>On a &s;un-&s;hine holiday&mdash;&endq;</L></Q>
<PB N="88" REF="97">
And yet it is as much as I can do to keep Mrs. Ar|nold
from going to neighbouring hou&s;es in her &s;mock,
in de$pite of decency and my known di&s;approbation.</P>
<P>I FIND my&s;elf more of a patriot than l ever thought
I was. Upon reading the account of the battle, I
found a very &s;en&s;ible plea&s;ure, or, as the Methodi&s;ts
term it, perceived my heart <HI>enlarged,</HI> &amp;c. The map
you &s;ent me is a pretty kind of <HI>toy,</HI> but does not
enough particularize the &s;cenes of the war, &amp;c. which
was the end I had in view when I &s;ent for it.</P>
<P>&startq;O DURA me&s;&s;orum ilia!&endq; About half the ap|petite,
dige&s;tion, &s;trength, &s;pirits, &amp;c. of a mower,

them to my new acquaintance, Mr. Lyt|telton
Brown. I like the humour of the ballad you

&startq;Cannon, Cannon,&endq; are admirably expre&s;&s;ive of the
&s;ound, I dare &s;ay: I mean, jointly with its echo;

<P>YOU may rea&s;onably have expected a letter be|fore
now, either as an acknowledgement for
your genteel pre&s;ent, or at lea&s;t by way of informa|tion
that I had received it. The prints have given
me a plea&s;ure, which, however con&s;iderable, would
&s;oon have langui&s;hed, if I had bought them at a
&s;hop; but which is now built upon the e&s;teem I
have for the giver, and cannot have a more durable
foundation.&mdash;As for the re&s;t, I am mo&s;t plea&s;ed with
the view of Matlock, and &s;hall have no peace of
mind till I have &s;een the original. I have been gild|ing
the frames, and wi&s;hing all the while for your
company.</P>
<P>I WILL alter the ballad according to your advice;
dividing it into three parts, and adding a &s;tanza or
two to the &s;horte&s;t, &s;ome time or other. I have had
no opportunity of trying the tunes. &startq;Arno's vale&endq;
has pretty words, and recommends it&s;elf to one's
imagination by the probability that it was written
on a real occa&s;ion&mdash;the &s;imilitude of rhimes in the
clo&s;e inexcu&s;able. For all that has been the &s;ubject
of my letter hitherto, as the country people &s;ay, I

as to the &s;ongs I will re-pay you.</P>

would run thus: &startq;The Villa, a Poem; containing a

A good excu&s;e for lazine&s;s! you will &s;ay: and lazy

my own &s;ayings; but I could not con&s;cientiou&s;ly
u&s;e a joke to you which I had u&s;ed in another let|ter,
without owning it.&mdash;In &s;hort, it is nece&s;&s;ary to

have &s;ome <HI>earthly</HI> aim in view; the next world,
whether it be in reality near or far off, is always
<HI>&s;een</HI> at a di&s;tance. All that the generality of young
people can do is, to act <HI>con&s;i&s;tently with</HI> their ex|pectations
there. Now, though &s;ame, &amp;c. be obvi|ou&s;ly

that of having no <HI>hopes</HI> here, becau&s;e one &s;ees no|thing

not but I would act with &s;o much indifference as to
bear all di&s;appointment unconcernedly&mdash;as, I dare

upon an equally &s;prightly footing with ambition,
and that is love; which, as it <HI>regularly tends</HI> to ma|trimony,
requires certain favours from fortune and
circum&s;tance to render it proper to indulge in.&mdash;

<HEAD>XXXIX. To Mr. GRAVES, on Social Happine&s;s.</HEAD>
<OPENER>Dear Mr. Graves,
<DATE>About 1745.</DATE></OPENER>
<P>THERE is not a &s;yllable you tell me concerning
your&s;elf in your la&s;t letter, but what applied
to <HI>me</HI> is mo&s;t literally true. I am &s;en&s;ible of the
daily progre&s;s I make towards in&s;ignificancy, and
it will not be many years before you &s;ee me ar|rived
at the <HI>ne plus ultra.</HI> I believe it is ab&s;olutely
impo&s;&s;ible for me to acquire a con&s;iderable degree
of knowledge, though I can under&s;tand things well
enough at the time I read them. I remember a
preacher at St. Mary's (I think it was Mr. E&mdash;)
trade a notable distinction betwixt <HI>apprehen&s;ion</HI> and
<PB N="101" REF="110">
<HI>comprehen&s;ion.</HI> If there be a real difference, pro|bably
it may find a place in the explication of my
genius. I envy you a good <HI>general</HI> in&s;ight into the
writings of the learned. I mu&s;t aim at nothing
higher than a well-concealed ignorance.&mdash;I was think|ing,
upon reading your &s;etter, <HI>when</HI> it was that you
and Mr. Whi&s;tler and I went out of the road of hap|pine&s;s.
It certainly was where we fir&s;t deviated
from the turnpike-road of life. Wives, children,
alliances, vi&s;its, &amp;c. are nece&s;&s;ary objects of our &s;o|cial
pa&s;&s;ions; and whether or no we can, through
particular circum&s;tances, be happy <HI>with,</HI> I think it
plain enough that it is not po&s;&s;ible to be happy <HI>with|out</HI>
them. All attachments to inanimate beauties,
to curio&s;ities, and ornaments, &s;atiate us pre&s;ently.&mdash;
The fanciful tribe has the di&s;advantage to be natural|ly
prone to err in the choice of <HI>la&s;ting</HI> plea&s;ures:
and when our pa&s;&s;ions have habitually wandered,
it is too difficult to reduce them into their proper
chanels. When this is the ca&s;e, nothing but the
change or variety of amu&s;ements &s;tands any chance
to make us ea&s;y, and it is not long ere the whole
&s;pecies is exhau&s;ted. I agree with you entirely in
the nece&s;&s;ity of a <HI>&s;ociable</HI> life in order to be happy:
I do not think it much a paradox, that any com|pany
is better than <HI>none.</HI> I think it obvious enough
as to the pre&s;ent hour; and as to any future influence,
&s;olitude has exceeding &s;avage effects on our di&s;|po&s;itions.&mdash;
I have wrote out my elegy: I lay no man|ner
<PB N="102" REF="111">
of &s;tre&s;s but upon the piety of it.&mdash;Would it
not be a good kind of motto, applied to a per&s;on
you know, that might be taken from what is &s;aid of
<HI>Ophelia</HI> in <HI>Hamlet,</HI>
<Q><L>&startq;I tell thee, faithle&s;s prie&s;t!</L>
<L>A mini&s;tring angel &s;hall Ophelia be</L>
<L>When thou art howling.&endq;</L></Q></P>
<P>I HAVE amu&s;ed my&s;elf often with this &s;pecies of
writing &s;ince you &s;aw me; partly to divert my pre&s;ent
<HI>impatience,</HI> and partly as it will be a picture of mo&s;t
that pa&s;&s;es in my mind; a portrait which <HI>friends</HI> may
value.&mdash;I &s;hould be glad of your profile: if you have
objections, I drop my reque&s;t.&mdash;I &s;hould be heartily
glad if you would come and live with me, for any
&s;pace of time that you could find convenient. But
I will depend on your coming over with Mr. Whi&s;tler
in the &s;pring. I may po&s;&s;ibly take a jaunt towards
yon ere long: the road would furni&s;h me out &s;ome
vi&s;its; and, by the time I reached you, perhaps,
afford me a kind of climax of happine&s;s. If I do
not, I &s;hall perhaps be a little time at Bath. I
do not &s;peak of this la&s;t as a &s;cheme from which I
entertain great expectations of plea&s;ure. It is long
&s;ince I have con&s;idered my &s;elf as <HI>undone.</HI> The <HI>world</HI>
will not perhaps con&s;ider me in that light entirely,
till I have married my maid. Adieu!</P>

<P>MY life, for aught I fee, will pa&s;s away ju&s;t

improvement into my circum&s;tances to give a cheer|ful

you will hear with &s;ome &s;atisfaction that I continue
&s;till the &s;ame. And this kind of <HI>identity,</HI> I think, I
could promi&s;e you, though every circum&s;tance in my
fortune, every particle of my body, were changed;
and others, ever &s;o heterogeneous, &s;ub&s;tituted in
their place. After this, it would be no compliment
to &s;ay, that the <HI>pretended</HI> heir to the&s;e kingdoms
could not alter it, were he to &s;ubvert the Briti&s;h con|&s;titution;
which mu&s;t, out of all doubt, be the con&s;equence
of his &s;ucce&s;s. The rebellion, you may
gue&s;s,
is the &s;ubject of all conver&s;ation. Every in|dividual
nailer here takes in a news-paper (a more
<HI>pregnant</HI> one by far than any of the London ones),
and talks as familiarly of <HI>kings</HI> and <HI>princes</HI> as ever
Ma&s;ter Shallow did of John of Gaunt. Indeed it
is no bad thing that they do &s;o; for I cannot con|ceive
that the people want &s;o much to be convinced

not &s;ay we could expre&s;s them &s;o politely.&mdash;I like
Secker's the be&s;t of any &s;ermon on this occa&s;ion.

from a <HI>change,</HI> as no man of &s;en&s;e can
po&s;&s;ibly doubt of, when fairly &s;tated: and, I own,
I cannot &s;ee one &s;ingle <HI>good</HI> it could produce, in com|pen&s;ation
for its inevitable and abundant <HI>mi&s;chiefs.</HI>&mdash;
I have read Dr. Sherlock's &s;ermon on this occa&s;ion:

mu&s;t make, to avoid a lethargy.&mdash;Public places I
want to vi&s;it a little; to peep at and renew my idea
of the <HI>world's</HI> vanity; but either Bath, or London
would &s;teep me &s;o far in poverty, that I &s;hould not
probably emerge before the middle of next &s;ummer.

<HEAD>XLI. To the &s;ame, with Remarks on the Execution

<OPENER>Dear Mr. Grave,
1746, ineunte anno.</OPENER>
<P>I BELIEVE it is impo&s;&s;ible for me to di&s;agree
with you on any other &s;core, than the &s;canty
pittances you allot me of your company; and, if I
have di&s;clo&s;ed any &s;ymptoms of re&s;entment on that
account, you will, perhaps, overlook them, out of
regard to the motive from which they proceeded.&mdash;
I thank you for your peru&s;al of that trivial poem.
If I were going to print it, I &s;hould give way to your
remarks <HI>implicitly,</HI> and would not <HI>dare</HI> to do other|wi&s;e.
But &s;o long as I keep it in manu&s;cript, you
will pardon my &s;illy prejudices, if I chu&s;e to read
and &s;hew it with the addition of mo&s;t of my new
&s;tanzas. I own, I have a fondne&s;s for &s;everal, imagin|ing
them to be <HI>more</HI> in Spen&s;er's way, yet more in|dependent
on the antique phra&s;e, than any part of
the poem; and, on that account, I cannot yet pre|vail
on my&s;elf to bani&s;h <HI>them</HI> entirely; but were I
to print, I &s;hould (with <HI>&s;ome</HI> reluctance) give way
to your &s;entiments (which I know are ju&s;), namely,
that they render the work too diffu&s;e and flimzy, and
&s;eem rather excre&s;cences than e&s;&s;ential parts of it.</P>
<P><PB N="107" REF="116">
BUT of the&s;e things I &s;ay no more now. I pur|po&s;e
&s;taying a month with Mr. Whi&s;tler in Decem|ber,
if it &s;uits him; and then I hope I &s;hall have a
great deal of your company. Let me hear &s;ome|thing
in your next of your <HI>dome&s;tic affairs.</HI> I beg
you would not make any grand deci&s;ion, without
giving me &s;ome previous information. I e&s;teem this
as due to the friend&s;hip I have &s;o long profe&s;&s;ed for
you, and from the friend&s;hip you have &s;o long pro|fe&s;&s;ed
for me.</P>
<P>I LOOK upon the death of the two Lords as equally
decent upon their re&s;pective principles. Lord Kil|marnock,
I &s;uppo&s;e, joined the rebels through a view
of bettering his circum&s;tances, con&s;ceious to him&s;elf
that he was guilty of a crime the moment he did &s;o.
This is agreeable to his &s;peech before the Lords,
and to that melancholy which he di&s;covered upon
the &s;caffold. Death, aggravated by guilt, would &s;it
heavier upon him than upon the other, even &s;up|po&s;ing
him to have had the &s;ame re&s;olution. Bal|merino's
life was quite <HI>unie,</HI> and his death equal to
the character he aimed at. We are to ob&s;erve, that
he meant to &s;uffer as a Friend to the Stewarts, a Sol|dier,
and a Scot&s;man. The fir&s;t he manife&s;ted when
he came out of the Tower, by his reply of &startq;God &s;ave
King J&mdash;s;&endq; the &s;econd, by his dre&s;s, and num|berle&s;s
o&s;tentations of intrepidity; the la&s;t, by his
plaid night-cap. Did you hear the &s;tory of his &s;end|ing
<PB N="108" REF="117">
a me&s;&s;age to Lord Kilmarnock? &startq;That he had
been practi&s;ing how to lye upon the block; and
had found out, the ea&s;ie&s;t way of receiving the
blow was, to bite his tongue hard: or even if
he bit it off, it was no matter, they &s;hould have
no further n&s;e for it.&endq; His behaviour &s;eems to
have wanted coolne&s;s, or el&s;e to equal that of Adrian,
Cato, Sir T. More, &amp;c. or any of tho&s;e heroes who
had &s;pirit enough to make an o&s;tentation of their
unconcern. I had, from the printed accounts of
their behaviour, an idea of their per&s;ons, exactly
conformable to the de&s;cription I read afterwards in
your paper;&mdash;but enough&mdash;you &s;end me &s;terling
maters of fact, and I return you tin&s;el ob&s;ervations.&mdash;
I thank you for accenting Cr$m$rtie and Balm$r$no;
I learnt Cullo$den from you <HI>before.</HI></P>
<P>I HAVE had little company &s;ince I &s;aw you.&mdash;
One day indeed I was &s;urprized by a vi&s;it from Mr.
Thom&s;on, Author of The Sea&s;ons.&mdash;Mr. Lyttelton
introduced him.&mdash;I have not room to tell you all
that pa&s;&s;ed.&mdash;They prai&s;ed my place extravagantly;&mdash;
propo&s;ed alterations, &amp;c. Thom&s;on was very face|tious,
and very complai&s;ant; invited me to his hou&s;e
at Richmond. There were many things &s;aid worth
<HI>telling,</HI> but not <HI>writing</HI> to you.&mdash;This has been a
&s;ummer that I have &s;pent more <HI>socially</HI> than any one

<P>YOUR neighbour, I &s;ee, is not a little embarra&s;&s;ed
with his mills at Whitchurch I have long had an
eye upon his adverti&s;ement in the London Evening
Po&s;t, and been not a little &s;candalized thereat.
What has the name of a poet to do with the pub|lication
of lands and tenements? or the idea of
harmony with the noi&s;e of a water-mill? yet has
<PB N="110" REF="119">
he extracted mu&s;ic from the &s;ubject, and mirth from
his misfortunes; having &s;ent me a ballad upon the
miller, written with much ea&s;e and &s;ome drollery.</P>
<P>As to the light in which you place your pre&s;ent

&s;ituation I could wi&s;h you for your <HI>own &s;ake:</HI> for
&s;o far as I am concerned in your elevation, I can
a&s;&s;ure you very faithfully, that no circum&s;tances in

or recommend you to my re&s;pect, than the pre&s;ent.
My <HI>affection,</HI> you will ea&s;ily ob&s;erve, from the very
<HI>nature</HI> of affection in general, would &s;tand no chance
to be increa&s;ed by your promotion; and as for re|&s;pect,

<PB N="111" REF="120">
of <HI>my</HI> lamentations, I will not now enter upon the
rea&s;onablene&s;s of them. It is a &s;ubject, to tell you
the truth, on which you cannot reply without &s;ome
danger of hurting me.&mdash;As for politics (you will
blame this letter for dwelling &s;o much upon the &s;ub|ject
of yours); but as for politics, I think <HI>poets</HI> are
<HI>tories</HI> by nature, &s;uppo&s;ing them to be by nature
poets.&mdash;The love of an individual per&s;on or family,
that has worn a crown for many &s;ucce&s;&s;ions, is an in|clination
greatly adapted to the fanciful tribe. On
the other hand, mathematicians, ab&s;tract-rea&s;oners,
of no manner of attachment to per&s;ons, at lea&s;t to
the <HI>vi&s;ible</HI> part of them, but prodigiou&s;ly devoted
to the ideas of virtue, liberty, intere&s;t, and &s;o forth,
are generally <HI>whigs.</HI> It happens agreeably enough to
this maxim, that the whigs are friends to that wi&s;e,
plodding, un-poetical people the Dutch&mdash;the to|ries,
on the other hand, are taken mightily with
that &s;hewy, o&s;tentatious nation the French. Fox|hunters,
that re&s;ide among&s;t the beauties of nature,
and bid defiance to art, in &s;hort, that have intellects
of a poetical <HI>turn,</HI> are frequently tories&mdash;citizens,
merchants, &amp;c. that &s;carce &s;ee what nature is, and
con&s;equently have no preten&s;ions to a poetical ta&s;te,
are, I think, generally argumentative and whiggi&s;h;&mdash;
but perhaps I carry this too far.&mdash;Something there
is in it, however, you will &s;ee: not that I would ap|ply
what I here &s;ay to particular revolutions, &amp;c.
I would only advance &s;omething general and &s;pecu|lative.

<OPENER>Dear Mr. Graves,
The Lea&s;owes,

<P>THOUGH I feel an irre&s;i&s;ible propen&s;ity to
write to you this very po&s;t, yet I cannot &s;ay that
I am able to advance any thing tending either to your
<PB N="113" REF="122">
own or my &s;atisfaction.&mdash;What is wor&s;t of all is, I
cannot fix the time of &s;eeing you with &s;much pre|ci&s;ion
as I would always endeavour where my plea&s;ure
is &s;o much concerned&mdash;I will tell you the whole af|fair.&mdash;I
have for a long &s;ea&s;on purpo&s;ed to drink the
Bath waters this &s;pring; and <HI>did</HI> think of &s;etting out
in a week's time, when I received your letter, pur|po&s;ing
to &s;tay there a month; and from thence take
a circuit which &s;hould indulge me in a &s;ight of you,
Mr. Whi&s;tler, and &s;ome few others, in my way home.
The latter part of this &s;cheme (though far the more
agreeable to me) was rather doubtful and precari|ous;
depending (as you expre&s;s it) on the &s;tate of my
finances after a month's continuance at Bath; which
I con&s;idered, and <HI>do</HI> con&s;ider, as a very probable means
of bettering my con&s;titution.&mdash;Now I covet to &s;ee you
&s;o much, that I would bring nothing but health in
competition.&mdash;What I wi&s;h is, that you could, with
convenience, either <HI>ha&s;ten</HI> or <HI>delay</HI> your journey, that
you might find me before mine, or after my return,
though I &s;hould infinitely, and for many rea&s;ons, pre|fer
the former. I long to talk with you particularly
now. I have much to &s;ay in regard to our friend's
amour, to which you alluded in your la&s;t. I reque&s;t
it as a favour of you, that you would conjure him,
by the friend&s;hip I have ever born him, and by any
e&s;teem which he has ever profe&s;&s;ed for me, that he
would do nothing very <HI>material</HI> in the affair till I
<PB N="114" REF="123">
have talked it over, and given him my faithful
&s;entiments, &startq;quod cen&s;et amiculus.&endq;</P>
<P>I AM not willing the balance &s;hould turn entirely
on the whig &s;ide: I would give it a greater equili|brium,
if the following &s;ugge&s;tion might effect it.
Tories, I &s;aid, have great, and &s;ometimes partial
affections for the <HI>per&s;on</HI> of a king.&mdash;We will &s;uppo&s;e
that kings are alternately good and bad: their loyal|ty
to the good one is commendable; their partiality
to the bad one not to be vindicated. Whigs have
<HI>no</HI> pa&s;&s;ion, <HI>no</HI> gratitude, towards the good prince:
there they are wrong. They are &s;evere upon the bad
one, in which they are ju&s;tifiable. I wi&s;h I had not
begun the&s;e whole&s;ale di&s;tinctions, this mi&s;erable
&s;pecimen of my politics. I prote&s;t again&s;t all epi&s;to|lary
di&s;putes. I am now embarra&s;&s;ed in one, on
much &s;uch another &s;core, which fills up all my let|ter;
for I love the la&s;t word, like a &s;cold or a child.&mdash;I
thank you for your little anecdotes from time
to time: you may depend upon it, that I have
never heard any thing <HI>before;</HI> for I never <HI>do</HI> hear any thing.&mdash;I am one very thankful letter in debt
to your neighbour Whi&s;tler. I have at pre&s;ent no|thing
but the <HI>propen&s;ity</HI> of a good corre&s;pondent; but
I will write &s;oon. In the mean time, if you &s;ee
him, ask him if he goes to Bath or Bri&s;tol this &s;ea|&s;on.&mdash;
I beg you would write to me directly <HI>when</HI>
you can come, and how I may regulate my motions

and Pain.</HEAD>
<OPENER>Dear Mr. Graves,
The Lea&s;owes,
<DATE>June the la&s;t, 1747.</DATE></OPENER>
<P>IT is now, I believe, near half a year &s;ince I had
the favour of a letter from you. When I wrote
la&s;t, I di&s;covered a more than ordinary &s;olicitude for
<HI>one</HI> immediate an&s;wer. It puzzles me to account for
your unu&s;ual &s;ilence, otherwi&s;e than upon &s;uppo&s;ition
of &s;ome offence you have taken: and it puzzles me
as much to gue&s;s by what behaviour of mine I have
been &s;o unhappy as to give you that offence.</P>
<P>I AM vain enough to imagine that the little me|rit
I have, de&s;erves &s;omewhat more regard than I
have met with from the world. Be that as it will,
the di&s;appointment I mu&s;t undergo, by any <HI>appearance</HI> of neglect from the friends I value, would more
effectually di&s;pirit me than any other what&s;oever.</P>
<P><PB N="116" REF="125">
I HAVE publi&s;hed my de&s;ign of vi&s;iting you, and
Mr. Whi&s;tler in Oxford&s;hire, to all the world. A
thou&s;and incidents have hitherto interfered with it,
which I will not now recount. But when I look
back upon the regular &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of them, it looks as
if De&s;tiny had &s;ome hand in detaining me. The
mo&s;t <HI>vigorous</HI> of my <HI>hopes</HI> dwell upon &s;eeing you next
winter, though I am not a little indulgent to <HI>those</HI>
that tell me I may &s;ee you long before.</P>
<P>I HAVE brought my place here to greater per|fection
than it has ever yet appeared in; and, with
the <HI>mob,</HI> it is in &s;ome vogue. Neverthele&s;s, I do not
know that I ever reli&s;hed if le&s;s in my life than I
have done this &s;ummer. Bad health, bad &s;pirits, no
company to my mind, and no corre&s;pondences, are
enough to bla&s;t the &s;weete&s;t &s;hades, and to poi&s;on
the pure&s;t fountains. Some of the&s;e misfortunes I
can impute to my own mi&s;conduct, and it embitters
them. The two l&s;t I can le&s;s account for, having
at all times done all I was able to recommend my|&s;elf
to my <HI>friends,</HI> behaving at the &s;ame time with
courte&s;y to the re&s;t of the world. The fact is not
true; otherwi&s;e I might re&s;olve it into this, that I
alone am idle, and all the world is <HI>bu&s;y.</HI></P>
<P>I FANCY you will imagine I lay too much &s;tre&s;s
upon Mr. Thom&s;on's vi&s;it, when I mention the fol|lowing
in&s;cription upon a &s;eat in Virgil's grove:

<HEAD>XLV. To the &s;ame, with Thoughts on Advice.</HEAD>
<OPENER>Dear Mr. Graves,
The Len&s;owes,
<DATE>Sept. 21, 1747.</DATE></OPENER>
<P>I AM under &s;ome apprehen&s;ion that you dread
the &s;ight of a letter from me, as it &s;eems to lay
claim to the compliment of an an&s;wer. I will there|fore
write you one that &s;hall wave its privilege, at
lea&s;t till &s;uch time as your lei&s;ure encourages, or
your pre&s;ent di&s;&s;ipation does not forbid, you to &s;end
one.&mdash;I dare now no longer expatiate upon the af|fair
you have in hand; it is enough for me if you
will excu&s;e the freedom I <HI>have</HI> taken. I have often
known <HI>delay</HI> produce good effects in &s;ome ca&s;es which
even &s;agacity it&s;elf could not &s;urmount; and, if
I thought I did not go too far, would pre&s;ume to
recommend it now. You know I have very little
of the temper of an alderman. I almo&s;t hate the
<HI>idea</HI> of wealthine&s;s as much as the <HI>word.</HI> It &s;eems
to me to carry a notion of fulne&s;s, &s;tagnation, and
in&s;ignificancy. It is this di&s;po&s;ition of mine that
can <HI>alone</HI> give any weight to the advice I &s;end you,
as it proves me not to give it through any partiality
to fortune. As to what remains, you are, I hope,
a&s;&s;ured of the value I mu&s;t ever have for you in <HI>any</HI>
<PB N="120" REF="129">
circum&s;tances, and the regard I &s;hall always &s;hew
for any that belongs to you. I cannot like you <HI>le&s;s</HI>
or <HI>more.</HI>&mdash;I now drop into other matters. Bergen,
I &s;ee, is taken at la&s;t; pray what are the &s;entiments
of your political companions? I dined &s;ome time
ago with Mr. Lyttelton and Mr. Pitt, who both
agreed it was worth twenty thou&s;and men to the
French; which is a light in which I never u&s;ed to
con&s;ider it. Any little intimation that you plea&s;e to
<HI>confer</HI> upon me, enables me to &s;eem <HI>wi&s;e</HI> in this
country for a month; particularly if I take care to
adju&s;t my face accordingly.&mdash;As I was returning la&s;t
Sunday from church, whom mould I meet in my
way, but that <HI>&s;weet-&s;ouled</HI> bard Mr. James Thom&s;on,
in a chai&s;e drawn by two hor&s;es lengthways.&mdash;
I welcomed him into the country, and a&s;ked him
to accompany Mr. Lyttelton to The Lea&s;owes (who
had offered me a vi&s;it), which he promi&s;ed to do.
So I am in daily expectations of them and all the
world this week. I fancy they will lavi&s;h all their
prai&s;es upon <HI>nature,</HI> re&s;erving none for poor <HI>art</HI> and
<HI>me.</HI> But if I ever live, and am able to perfect my
&s;chemes, I &s;hall not de&s;pair of plea&s;ing the few I
fir&s;t began with, <HI>the few friends prejudiced in my fa|vour;</HI>
and then &startq;Fico por los malignatores.&endq; Cen|&s;ures
will not affect me; for I am armed &s;o &s;trong
in <HI>vanity,</HI> that they will pa&s;s by me as the idle wind
which I regard not.&mdash;I think it pretty near equal,
in a country place, whether you gain the &s;mall num|ber
<PB N="120" REF="130">
of ta&s;ters, or the <HI>large crowd</HI> of the vulgar. The
latter are more frequently met with, and <HI>gape,</HI> &s;tu|pent.
and <HI>&s;tare</HI> much more. But one would chu&s;e
to plea&s;e a few <HI>friends</HI> of ta&s;te before mob or gentry,
the great vulgar or the &s;mall; becau&s;e therein one
gratifies both one's &s;ocial pa&s;&s;&s;&s;ions and one's pride,
that is, one's <HI>&s;elf</HI>-love. Above all things, I would
wi&s;h to plea&s;e <HI>you;</HI> and if I have a wi&s;h that pro|jects
or is prominent beyond the re&s;t, it is to &s;ee
you placed to your &s;atisfaction near me; but For|tune
mu&s;t vary from her u&s;ual treatment before &s;he
favours me &s;o far.&mdash;And yet there <HI>was</HI> a time, when
one might probably have prevailed on her. I knew
not what to do.&mdash;The affair was &s;o intricately cir|cum&s;tanced&mdash;
your &s;urprizing &s;ilence after the hint
I gave.&mdash;Mr. D&mdash;offering to &s;erve any friend of
mine; nay, pre&s;&s;ing me to u&s;e the opportunity.&mdash;
His other relations, his guardians, teizing him with
&s;ure &s;ymptoms of a rupture in ca&s;e of a refu&s;al on
<HI>their</HI> &s;ide.&mdash;Mr. P&mdash;&s;oliciting me if the place were

impartiality, &s;elf-intere&s;t (which I <HI>little</HI> regard|ed),
endeavouring to di&s;tract me; I think I never
&s;pent &s;o di&s;agreeable an half-year &s;ince I was born.
To clo&s;e the whole, I could not <HI>fore&s;ee</HI> the event,
which is almo&s;t foretold in your la&s;t letter, and I
knew I could not &s;erve you; but I mu&s;t render it a

the latter of the&s;e being the purpo&s;e of <HI>this</HI> mine

of you, in the mean time, to inform me, by a let|ter,

<P>As I was returning from church on Sunday la&s;t,
whom &s;hould I meet, in a chai&s;e, with two hor&s;es
length-ways, but that right friendly bard, Mr.
Thom&s;on? I complimented him upon his arrival in
this country, and a&s;ked him to accompany Mr. Lyt|telton
to The Lea&s;owes, which he &s;aid he would with
abundance of plea&s;ure; and &s;o we parted. Yon will
ob&s;erve, that the more &s;tre&s;s I lay upon this vi&s;it,
and the more I <HI>di&s;cover</HI> to you, the more &s;ub&s;tantial
is my apology for deferring mine into Warwick&s;hire.
I own, I am plea&s;ed with the pro&s;pect of &s;hewing
them &s;omething at The Lea&s;owes beyond what they
expect. I have begun my terras on the high hill
I &s;hewed you, made &s;ome con&s;iderable improvements
in Virgil's grove, and fini&s;hed a walk from it to
the hou&s;e, after a manner which you will approve.

They are going to build a ca&s;tle in the park round
the lodge, which, if well executed, mu&s;t have a good

anticipate every thing which I propo&s;e to do when
I become <HI>rich;</HI> but as that is never likely to be,
perhaps it is not of any importance;&mdash;but what I

<P>IF I come to your hou&s;e, positively I will not go
to &s;ee Mr. M&mdash;. He has been twice as near me as
The Grange, with C&mdash;L&mdash;, and never deemed

But I complain unju&s;tly of you; for, as you

<OPENER>Dear Mr. Jago,
<DATE>Sunday,
Feb. 14, 1747-8.</DATE></OPENER>
<P>I AM tempted once more to apologize for the un|&s;ea&s;onable
vi&s;it I paid you, though I feel my&s;elf
entirely innocent in that re&s;pect, even as much &s;o as
the po&s;t-boy was guilty; for had my previous letter
arrived in due time, you had then been furni&s;hed
with an opportunity of waving my company till a
more convenient &s;ea&s;on. I was <HI>only,</HI> or, at lea&s;t,
<HI>chiefly</HI> unea&s;y upon <HI>your</HI> account. I &s;pent my time
very agreeably, and only le&s;s &s;o than I might, had
I not been con&s;cious to my&s;elf that I was intruding
upon dome&s;tic tenderne&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>I SPENT the Sunday night and the next day at
Mr. Wren's; and am now ju&s;t returned from Mr.
Dolman's, who has made me a genteel pre&s;ent of
Spence's Polymetis. I have not yet <HI>read</HI> many dia|logues

rea&s;on to be well enough &s;atisfied with the &s;imple

Mr. Lowth's poem. I have long known of this
intended <HI>introduction</HI> (which I accidentally found to
have been &s;ettled betwixt them before I publi&s;hed
<HI>mine</HI> on the &s;ame &s;ubject), and a little dreaded the
<HI>form</HI> of it. I have long ago made con&s;iderable im|provements
<PB N="133" REF="142">

publi&s;h it once more; after which, let it &s;leep in

<P>I know I have thrown a great number of carele&s;s
things into your hands. I know to <HI>whom</HI> I in|tru&s;ted
my follies; but I know <HI>not</HI> what they <HI>are:</HI>&mdash;
I believe, in general, that they con&s;i&s;t of mis-begot|ten
embryos and abortive births, which it had been
merely decent to have buried in&mdash;&s;ome part of my
garden;&mdash;but I was morally a&s;&s;ured that you would
expo&s;e nothing of mine to my di&s;advantage. As
to &s;ome that are <HI>le&s;s imperfect,</HI> you promi&s;ed your ob|&s;ervations,
and I de&s;ire you would make them with
the utmo&s;t freedom. I can bear any cen&s;ure which
you &s;hall pa&s;s by way of letter, and I beg once more
that you would not be &s;paring. It will be e&s;teemed
as great a favour as you can do me. When they
have gone, t$$ough your hands, and tho&s;e of one
<PB N="134" REF="143">
or two more friends, I &s;hall, perhaps, think of pub|li&s;hing
them; though as to that, much depends
upon the advice I receive, and previou&s;ly on the op|portunity
I have of receiving it. I am in hopes that
you will be pretty full in di&s;covering to me, <HI>which
you di&s;like the lea&s;t, what faults you find,</HI> and <HI>what
improvements they are capable of.</HI> I &s;et you a tedious
ta&s;k; but I will return the favour as far as I am able,
either in <HI>the &s;ame way</HI> or any other. This brings
me to &s;ay, that, if there be any compositions of
yours that you would have me correct (and there
are &s;everal of which I want a copy), I would beg
you to &s;end them. Your Blackbird excels any
&s;inging-bird I ever heard; and I be&s;eech you to
convey it to The Lea&s;owes by the next opportunity,
that he may acquire fame near other rills, and in
other valleys, than tho&s;e in which he was produced.</P>
<P>I HAVE many compliments to make in your country;
to Mr. H&mdash;, Mrs. N&mdash;, Mrs. J&mdash;, Mr. F&mdash;, Mr.

I will a&s;&s;uredly call and &s;pend a night with you.&mdash;

I HAVE &s;uffered greatly by raising at the black

mine for his own; which latter I &s;ent in order to
be commuted at Birmingham, and was almo&s;t &s;tarved

There is no trifling with any <HI>part</HI> of orthodoxy with
impunity.&mdash;That is the moral.</P>
<P>I HAVE received a very obliging letter from Lady
Luxborough, wherein &s;he tells me that Lady Hart|ford
admires my place in her de&s;cription. Mr.
Thom&s;on is intimate at Lady Hartford's; and I &s;up|po&s;e
Lady Hartford may have been informed by
Lady L. that Mr. Thom&s;on has been here; &s;o I con|clude,
in mere vanity, that my farm is advancing in
reputation.</P>
<P>WHAT think you of Mr. Carte's Hi&s;tory? or what
of his narrative concerning the Pretender's touching
for the King's evil! I think one is not, however,
to give up his book entirely; becau&s;e, with <HI>all his
&s;uper&s;tition,</HI> he may have &s;everal anecdotes that one

<P>I HAVE had great expectations from the beautiful

<PB N="136" REF="145">
like nothing in the world as old B&mdash;'s callimanco

<P>I HAVE nothing to add worth beginning upon
another page; but I happened not to make a regular
conclusion in my preceding one.</P>
<P>YOU mu&s;t give me &s;ome time to colour you a
collection of flowers (that octavo edition I &s;hewed
you here); and then I will make Mrs. Jago a pre|&s;ent
of it. I believe I can engage Mr. Dolman to
a&s;&s;i&s;t me, who is much my &s;uperior in point of ac|curacy;

but I would not have you content your&s;elf with a

<P>I HAVE had a couple of paintings given me &s;ince
you were here. One of them is a Madona, valued,
as it is &s;aid, at ten guineas in Italy, but which you
would hardly purcha&s;e at the price of five &s;hillings.
However, I am endeavouring to make it out to be
one of Carlo Maratt's, who was a fir&s;t hand, and
famous for Madonas; even &s;o as to be nick-named
&startq;Cartuccio delle Madonne&endq; by Salvator Ro&s;a. Two
letters of the cypher (CM) agree; what &s;hall I do
with regard to the third? It is a &s;mall piece, and
&s;adly blackened. It is about the &s;ize (though not

and has much &s;uch a frame.</P>
<P>A PERSON may amu&s;e him&s;elf almo&s;t as cheaply

mea&s;ure back before I can get into it my&s;elf, and
no kind of re&s;olution to take a &s;ingle &s;tep. My
chief amu&s;ements at pre&s;ent are the &s;ame they have

French have what they call a <HI>parque orn&eacute;e;</HI> I &s;up|po&s;e,
approaching about as near to a garden as the

<HI>ferme orn&eacute;e;</HI> though, if I had money, I &s;hould hardly
confine my&s;elf to &s;uch decorations as that name re|quires.
I have made great improvements; and the

I &s;uppo&s;e your objections were grounded on

le&s;s weight, as they &s;uppo&s;ed you acted indi&s;creetly
your&s;elf: I can &s;ay but little on the occa&s;ion. You
know&mdash;better than I do. Only this I mu&s;t add,
that I have &s;o great an e&s;teem for your &s;i&s;ter, that
it will be nece&s;&s;ary to my <HI>ea&s;e,</HI> that whoever marries
her &s;he &s;hould be happy.</P>

<OPENER>Dear Mr. Jago,
<DATE>Sept. 3, Saturday night, 1748.</DATE></OPENER>
<P>I HARDLY know whether it will be prudent in
me to own, that I wrote you a <HI>long letter</HI> upon
the receipt of your la&s;t, which I now have upon
my table. I condemn this habit in <HI>my&s;elf</HI> entirely,
and &s;hould, I am &s;ure, be very unhappy, if my
friends, by my example, &s;hould be induced to con|tract
the &s;ame. The truth is, I had not expre&s;&s;ed
my&s;elf in it to my mind, and it was full of blots,
and blunders, and interlinings; yet, &s;uch as it was,
it had wearied my attention, and given me a di&s;in|clination
to begin it afre&s;h. I am now impatient
to remove any &s;cruple you may have concerning my
grateful &s;en&s;e of all your favours, and the invariable
continuance of my affection and e&s;teem.&mdash;I find by
your la&s;t obliging letter, that my machinations and
devices are not entirely private.&mdash;You knew of my
draught of Hagley Ca&s;tle about the bigne&s;s of a
barley-corn; you knew of our intended vi&s;it to
<PB N="145" REF="154">
Lady Luxborough's; and I mu&s;t add, Mr. Thomas
Hall knew of my contrivance for the embelli&s;hment
of Mr. Hardy's hou&s;e. Nothing is there hid that
&s;hall not be revealed.&mdash;Our vi&s;it to Barrels is now
Over and pa&s;t.&mdash;Lady Luxborough has &s;een Hagley
Ca&s;tle in the original:&mdash;and as to my de&s;ire that
my draught might be &s;hewn to no <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> &s;oul,
you &s;urely did but ill comply with it, when you
&s;hewed that <HI>drawing</HI> to a <HI>Clergyman.</HI> However, you
may have acted up to my <HI>real</HI> meaning, if you
have taken care not to &s;hew it to any connoi&s;&s;eu$.
I meant chiefly to guard again&s;t any one that knows
the rules, in who&s;e eyes, I am &s;ure, it could not
turn to my credit.&mdash;Pray how do you like the
fe&s;toons dangling over the oval windows?&mdash;It is the
chief advantage in repairing an old hou&s;e, that one
may deviate from the rules without any extraordinary
cen&s;ure.</P>
<P>I WILL not trouble you <HI>now</HI> with many particu|lars.
The intent of Tom's coming is, to de&s;ire your
company and Mrs. Jago's this week.&mdash;I &s;hould be
extremely glad if your convenience would allow you
to come on Monday or Tue&s;day; but, if it is <HI>entirely</HI>
impracticable, I would be&s;eech you not to put <HI>off</HI>
the vi&s;it longer than the Monday following, for the
leaves of my groves begin to fall a great pace.&mdash;
I beg once more, you would let no &s;mall incon|venience
prevent your being here on Monday.&mdash;As
<PB N="146" REF="155">
to my vi&s;it at Icheneton, you may depend upon
it &s;oon after; and I hope you will not &s;tand upon
punctilio, when I mention my inclination that you
may all take a walk through my coppices before
their beauty is much impaired. Were I in a &s;prightly
vein, I would aim at &s;aying &s;omething genteel by
way of <HI>an&s;wer</HI> to Mrs. Jago's compliment.&mdash;As it
is, I can only thank her for the <HI>&s;ub&s;tance,</HI> and applaud
the <HI>politene&s;s</HI> of it.&mdash;I po&s;tpone all other matters till

<P>I THANK you very <HI>&s;en&s;ibly</HI> for the ver&s;es with

give me leave, when I &s;ee you, to propo&s;e &s;ome lit|tle

of late acquired an <HI>ea&s;e</HI> in writing; and I

<HI>here.</HI>&mdash;As it is, I will erect an $urn in Virgil's Grove

<HEAD>LIII. To the &s;ame.</HEAD>
<OPENER>Dear Mr. Jago,
Sunday night,
<DATE>Sept, 11, 1748.</DATE></OPENER>
<P>I TAKE this opportunity of acknowledging the
ju&s;tice of your excu&s;es. Mrs. Jago's pre&s;ent cir|cum&s;tances
render her vi&s;it quite impracticable, and
yours I have the &s;ame kind of rea&s;on to di&s;pen&s;e
with; as I gue&s;s, that &s;he could as &s;oon take a
journey <HI>her&s;elf</HI> at this time, as bear that <HI>you</HI> &s;hould.&mdash;
But to &s;ay I was not greatly mortified, would be
<PB N="148" REF="157">
doing my&s;elf the greate&s;t inju&s;tice. <HI>Di&s;appointed</HI> I
was, you may be &s;ure, to hear excu&s;es; even as
much as Sir John Fal&s;taff, when Mr. Dombledon
put him in mind of <HI>&s;ecurity,</HI> in&s;tead of &s;ending him
<HI>two</HI> and <HI>thirty yards</HI> of &s;attin to make him a <HI>&s;hort</HI>
cloak. And on the whole, I began to accu&s;e you
and Mrs. Jago of <HI>colloguing</HI> together, to fix your
vi&s;it at a time when you were well a&s;&s;ured you &s;hould
have an <HI>apology</HI> to &s;end me in&s;tead. Now, if I &s;hould
pre&s;s this accu&s;ation, pray how would you evade
the force of it?&mdash;The next thing I am to &s;peak to,
is your ver&s;es. I have made you my acknowledg|ments
<HI>before;</HI> and as you are &s;o good as to accept
them, I will not trouble you with additional pro|fe&s;&s;ions,
or repetitions of the pa&s;t. I will depend
upon your good-&s;en&s;e for an excu&s;e, if I only add
what I think proper as to any <HI>alteration;</HI> wherein
I have a view to <HI>your</HI> credit, as well as my <HI>own.</HI> I
confe&s;s, it requires &s;ome nicety to in&s;cribe &s;uch an
elegy as &startq;The Gold-finches&endq; without the danger you
fore&s;aw. But I think it <HI>may</HI> be done (and <HI>is</HI> pretty
nearly) in &s;uch manner that no man of <HI>ta&s;te</HI> will be
tempted to ridicule it; and as for the vulgar, of
whatever <HI>rank</HI> they be, it is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary
many times to <HI>give them up. Ta&s;te</HI> and <HI>tenderne&s;s</HI> are
ab&s;olutely connected; and you may very readily call
to mind &s;ome charming things, that mu&s;t excite the
laughter of your men of <HI>fire</HI> and <HI>banter,</HI> but are
by no means thought the wor&s;e of by men of <HI>true
<PB N="149" REF="158">
genius.</HI> I will only mention Andrew Marvel's <HI>Fawn</HI>
in Dryden's Mi&s;cellanies. I inclo&s;e the elegy with
&s;ome few propo&s;ed alterations, &s;o I will not ri&s;que
the <HI>filing</HI> my <HI>letter</HI> with critici&s;m. I al&s;o inclo&s;e
the other ver&s;es you &s;ent me, which I think good
ones, and to &s;tand in need of little alteration, be|&s;ide
that of the inglorious name at the head of them;
to which, not with&s;tanding, I will never &s;ubmit. Pray
who is the young gentleman that tran&s;lates your
elegy into Latin?&mdash;The new dre&s;s will give you
&s;ome amu&s;ement; and, if the&s;e lines <HI>be</HI> the product
of the genius of a boy of that age, he will in a year's
time be able to extend the &s;ame of your compo&s;i|tions.
I &s;hall then be glad to &s;ee &startq;The Gold-finches&endq;
under his hand; though I have no extraordinary
fondne&s;s for the Latin poetry of a modern; at lea&s;t,
till your elde&s;t &s;on begins to tran&s;late our madri|gals.</P>
<P>I HAVE not yet &s;een Mr. Thom&s;on's &startq;Ca&s;tle of
Indolence.&endq;&mdash;I waited for a &s;maller edition; but am
now too impatient not to &s;end for it on Thur&s;day
next.&mdash;I am fully bent on rai&s;ing a neat urn to him
in my lower grove, if Mr. Lyttelton does not in|&s;cribe
one at Hagley <HI>before</HI> me. But I &s;hould be ex|tremely
glad of your advice whereabouts to place
it.&mdash;You &s;peak of my dwelling in the Ca&s;tle of In|dolence,
and I verily believe I <HI>do.</HI> There is &s;omething
like enchantment in my pre&s;ent inactivity; for, without
<PB N="150" REF="159">
any kind of lett or impediment to the correction of
my trifles that I &s;ee, I am in no wi&s;e able to make
the lea&s;t advances. I think within my&s;elf I could
proceed if you were here; and yet I have rea&s;on to
believe, if you were here, we &s;hould only ramble
round the groves, and chat away the time; and
perhaps <HI>that,</HI> upon the <HI>whole,</HI> is of full as much
importance.&mdash;I do not know but I do my&s;elf &s;ome
little inju&s;tice here, for I <HI>have</HI> wrote out my <HI>levitics</HI>
and my <HI>$word$,</HI> good and bad, with many ornaments
from the pencil; and the next thing I do will be to
tran&s;cribe my elegies. The fault is, I take no pains
to <HI>improve</HI> what I tran&s;cribe, and con&s;equently am
only able to exhibit my non&s;en&s;e in a fairer dre&s;s.&mdash;
You mu&s;t give me leave, ere it be long, to in&s;ert
two or three lines (I think in <HI>ver&s;e)</HI> before Mrs.
Jago's flower-piece.&mdash;I am &s;ure, I am obliged to her
for a fruit I greatly love&mdash;it was not entirely ripe;
but it was the only one I have ta&s;ted &s;ince I was la&s;t

Did not you tell me of a treati&s;e that your Mr. Mil|ler

a double plea&s;ure from any prai&s;es which it receives.&mdash;
I had here la&s;t Wedne&s;day Dean Lyttelton, Mr.

The Lea&s;owes,
<DATE>Mar. 15, 1749-50.</DATE></OPENER>
<P>THOUGH I have not hitherto troubled you with
a letter, I have not been void either of <HI>inquiry</HI> or
<HI>information,</HI> concerning the &s;tate of your affairs, and
<PB N="163" REF="172">
of Mr. Hardy's health. Indeed it is now &s;everal
weeks &s;ince I collected &s;ome particulars from your
brother, and I am now impatient for further intelli|gence.
As to the circum&s;tances of our friendly re|ception
at Wroxall, Mr. John Jago has probably
enough acquainted you with them. He <HI>would,</HI> how|ever,
&s;educe me to give you a di&s;tinct account; being
a&s;&s;ured, as he &s;ays, that Mr. Wren's behaviour mu&s;t
afford a good &s;ubject for drollery. I do not know
how far this would be proper; but I think, when I
write again to my friend Wren, to give <HI>him</HI> a &s;ketch
of his own character, ju&s;t as it appeared to us during
the time of our vi&s;it. Perhaps it may avail a little.
Amid&s;t his violent pa&s;&s;ion for gardening, if he would
but prune away &s;ome wild excre&s;cences from one or
two branches of his character, he might bring him|&s;elf
to bear good fruit. He &s;hould <HI>weed</HI> his <HI>mind</HI> a
little; where there has &s;prung up a mo&s;t luxuriant crop
of puns, that threaten to choak all its whole&s;ome pro|ductions&mdash;
&startq;Spinas animo fortius quam agro evellat.&endq;
He has good &s;en&s;e and good-nature; pity he &s;hould
di&s;gui&s;e them!&mdash;not but that it is better to have the
<HI>&s;ub&s;tance</HI> alone than the <HI>forms alone,</HI> and &s;o I conclude.
Since I came home, I have done little el&s;e than plant
bu&s;hes, hazel, hawthorn, crabtree, elder, &amp;c. toge|ther
with &s;ome flowering &s;hrubs that I have had gi|ven
me, and &s;ome that I have purcha&s;ed to the amount
of twenty &s;hillings. I think nothing remarkable has
occurred; only, one mi&s;erable tempe&s;tuous day, I
<PB N="164" REF="173">
had my Lord Stamford, who called to see my walks.
My Lord promi&s;ed to come again in the &s;ummer, and
invited me more than once to Enville. By the way,
he is now building a Gothic green-hou&s;e by Mr.
Miller's direction, and intends to build ca&s;tles, and
God-knows-what. By all accounts, the place is well
worth &s;eeing when you come into the country, which
I hope you will not fail to do this &s;pring. Pray do
not you embroil me with Mr. Miller, in regard to <HI>any</HI>
ob&s;ervations I made in his walks. Remember, there
were a great many things with which I was highly de|lighted;
and forget that there were a few al&s;o which
I &s;eemed le&s;s to admire. Indeed, I thought it idle to
regulate my expre&s;&s;ions, among&s;t friends only, by the
&s;ame rules which I ought to ob&s;erve in mixed com|pany.
I &s;ay <HI>ought,</HI> for <HI>he</HI> has been exceedingly fa|vourable
to <HI>me</HI> in his repre&s;entation of The Lea&s;owes.&mdash;
I hope to &s;ee Mr. Fancourt with you, when you
come this &s;pring; and why not your brother? he can
&s;pend half a week every now and then at Wroxall.</P>
<P>I HAVE nothing to <HI>in&s;ert</HI> or <HI>inclo&s;e</HI> in this letter that
can render it at all agreeable.&mdash;I cannot <HI>write,</HI> I can|not
<HI>think.</HI> I can ju&s;t mu&s;ter up attention enough to
give orders to my workmen; I &s;aunter about my

then, I believe, our natural indolence would be a kind
of match for our ambition. I &s;hall probably enlarge

good deal upon this &s;ubject; but I have only room to
de&s;ire you would give me your opinion how I &s;hould
in&s;cribe my urn to Mr. Somervile. &startq;Author of The

<P>I ACKNOWLEDGE my&s;elf obliged to you for pro|curing

&s;afe, as I have a pretty &s;trong a&s;&s;urance I <HI>shall</HI> do mo&s;t
<PB N="166" REF="175">
articles of which my &s;ervant Tom has the care.&mdash;
He has punctuality and management, to <HI>atone</HI> for his
<HI>imperfections.</HI> He brought me tho&s;e paper-&s;culled
bu&s;ts from Wroxall entirely unhurt, contrary to the
expectation of all that &s;aw them; after which, he
might undertake for almo&s;t any thing.&mdash;The por|trait
is undoubtedly a good one. I &s;hewed it to
Mr. Smart (who is a painter him&s;elf, though a cler|gyman),
and he allowed as much; added al&s;o; that
it had &s;omething of Sir Godfrey Kneller, as well as
of Sir Peter Lely.&mdash;The flower-piece is very good,
&s;o far as relates to the flowers; the dog and parrot
abominable, and the grapes very exceptionable. I
never con&s;idered the two flower-pieces at Icheneton
with attention enough to cau&s;e a preference; having
never any thoughts that <HI>either</HI> would fall to my &s;hare.
I &s;hall add nothing with regard to your choice; but
that I &s;incerely <HI>hope</HI> yours is the better piece. I
never heard of Ca&s;teels, I own; nor can I find his
name in any of my accounts of the painters, though
they take in pretty modern ones: but I can &s;ay this
for your comfort, that if he excelled in any thing,
it was probably in flowers: for I &s;ee his name at
the bottom of tho&s;e flower-pieces that I have in water
colours, as the de&s;igner of them; and I think the
de&s;igns are good. Though I could with neither the
Cupid nor the fruit-piece had e&s;caped us, yet is there
no blame to be laid at your door; at lea&s;t &s;uppo&s;ing
that you are endowed with nothing more than ra|tional
<PB N="167" REF="176">
conjecture, and that you are not gifted with
prophe&s;y.</P>
<P>AND now, having &s;poken, I think, to <HI>mo&s;t</HI> parts
of your letter, I proceed to &s;ay a word or two in
the way of appendix. Fir&s;t then, after five or &s;ix
weeks work of ma&s;ons and carpenters, I plainly di&s;|cover
that my hou&s;e is an unfini&s;hable thing;&mdash;and
yet, I per&s;uade my&s;elf, there will never be wanting
a room in it, where you may &s;pend an agreeable
day with your undoubted friend.&mdash;Did ever tell you
how <HI>un&s;ea&s;onably</HI> the three fiddles &s;truck up in my
grove about an hour after you left me; and how
a &s;et of ten bells was heard from my wood the
evening after? It might have pa&s;&s;ed for the harmony
of &s;ome a&euml;rial &s;pirit, who was a well-wi&s;her to us
poor mortals; but that I think, had it been &s;o, it
would have been addre&s;&s;ed to the <HI>better &s;ort,</HI> and of
con&s;equence have been heard whil&s;t <HI>you</HI> were <HI>here.</HI>
This by way of introduction to what I am going to
tell you. Mr. Pixell has made an agreement with
his club at Birmingham, to give me a day's mu&s;ic
in &s;ome part of my walks. The time is not yet
fixed; but, if you were an idle man, and could be
brought over at a day or two's notice, I would give
it you, and be in hopes I could entertain you very
agreeably.</P>

the bu&s;ine&s;s or amu&s;ements of an idle man&mdash;as if
&s;uch a per&s;on's time was &s;o wholly filled up, that
he could not find half an hour to write a line to
his friend. It is be&s;t to acknowledge lazine&s;s at fir&s;t,
and that there are particular intervals, when one is
much le&s;s di&s;po&s;ed to write even a few lines than at
others; and then, as to lazine&s;s, one has nothing to
do but to plead human frailty; which, if a per&s;on
has not too many frailties be&s;ides, may perhaps
be indulged him. However, &startq;Veniarn petimu&s;que,
damu&s;que,&endq; will not fail to weigh with every good|natured
man. The chief dealing I have with Harris
the Jew is, for the intelligence which he brings me
concerning you and Mrs. W&mdash;; but it &s;eldom amounts
<PB N="170" REF="179">
to much more than that you are well, and in your
garden.</P>
<P>He is an Ebrew Jew, or he would tell me you
had purcha&s;ed a couple of genteel hor&s;es, or a chai&s;e
and pair, and were coming over to The Lea&s;owes to
&s;pend a week with me.</P>
<P>NEVERTHELESS, I hope to &s;ee you &s;oon: but <HI>en
pa&s;&s;ant</HI> I a&s;&s;ure you, I &s;hall go in about a month
to Mr. Jago's, and from thence to Mr. Miller's;
who, I believe I told you, was here, with Mr. Lyt|telton,
Lady Ayle&s;bury, Colonel Conway, &amp;c. I
think I never an&s;wered your query concerning Co|lonel
Lyttelton.&mdash;He is the &s;ame per&s;on that you
remember, and your prophe&s;y concerning him has
been literally accompli&s;hed. He is a man of courage,
genius, genero&s;ity, and politene&s;s; has been for|tunate
in the world; was made a Colonel at about
&s;ix and twenty; di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf in &s;everal cam|paigns;
married the Dutche&s;s of Bridgewater; and
had the other day about &s;ixteen thou&s;and pounds
left him by. Colonel Jefferies, a very di&s;tant rela|tion.
He has a &s;eat, and &s;peaks, in the Hou&s;e of
Commons; has bought a town and country-hou&s;e,
the latter of which he is ornamenting in the modern
way. His Dutche&s;s the mo&s;t unceremonious even-tempered
woman that lives.&mdash;So enjoy the &s;pirit of
prophe&s;y, and exert it again.&mdash;It needs little more
<PB N="171" REF="180">
than good &s;en&s;e. Which of the hi&s;torians is it, that
foretold in his hi&s;tory a very remarkable &s;eries of
events, by dint of this alone, and which were all
accompli&s;hed? Let me know what you are doing
now. Have you repaired the farm-hou&s;e you talked
of?&mdash;and have you remembered to make the man
a couple of good large niches in his chimney cor|ner,
where he and his family may &s;pend a more
comfortable evening than was ever &s;pent by any
fir&s;t mini&s;ter in Chri&s;tendom&mdash;perhaps al&s;o conver&s;e
more to the purpo&s;e? You tell me nothing of your
Mr. Jago, Seignior Benedict, the new-married man.
Tell him to leave his wife and family for a day or
two, &s;addle his mule, and come over to The Lea&s;owes.&mdash;
Tell him, all plea&s;ures are heightened by a little
di&s;continuance.&mdash;Tell him, did I &s;ay?&mdash;how can
you for &s;hame advi&s;e him &s;o contrarily to your own

<P>IT never can be that I owe you for three letters;
as to two, I will agree with you; one that I
received together with my books, and the other
&s;oon after; but that I am indebted for more than
the&s;e&mdash;
<Q><L>&startq;Credat Judaeus. Apella,</L>
<L>Non ego.&endq;</L></Q>
Even that &s;ame &startq;Judaeus A pella&endq; who affords me
this very opportunity of &s;ending my compliments
to you and Mrs. W&mdash;, and of a&s;&s;uring you, that
If I had not purpo&s;ed to have &s;een you, I had wrote
to you long ago.</P>
<P>MASTER Harris talks very re&s;pectfully of your
garden; and we have no di&s;pute, &s;ave only in one
point&mdash;he &s;ays, that you labour very hard in your
vocation; whereas I am not willing to allow that
all the work you ever did, or will do in it, is worth
a &s;ingle bunch of radi&s;hes. However, I dare not
contradict him too much, becau&s;e he waits for my
letter</P>
<P>How happy are you, that can hold up your &s;pade,
and cry, &startq;Avaunt, Satan!&endq; when a toyman offers
<PB N="173" REF="182">
you his deceit&s;ul vanities! Do not you rejoice in|wardly,
and pride your&s;elf greatly in your own phi|lo&s;ophy?
<Q><L>&startq;'Twas thus&mdash;</L>
<L>The wife Athenian cro&s;s'd a glitt'ring fair:</L>
<L>Unmov'd by tongues and &s;ights he walk'd the
place,</L>
<L>Thro' tape, tags, tin&s;el, gimp, perfume, and
lace;</L>
<L>Then bends from Mars's Hill his awful eyes,</L>
<L>And, &startq;What a world I never want!&endq; he cries.&endq;</L>
<L>PARNELL</L></Q>
Mean time, do not de&s;pi&s;e others that can find
any needful amu&s;ement in what, I think, Bunyan
very aptly calls <HI>Vanity Fair;</HI> I have been at it many
times this &s;ea&s;on, and have bought many kinds of
merchandize there. It is a part of philo&s;ophy, to
adapt one's pa&s;&s;ions to one's way of life; and the
&s;olitary un&s;ocial &s;phere in which I move makes me
think it happy that I can retain a reli&s;h for &s;uch
trifles as I can draw into it. Mean time, I dare
not rea&s;on too much upon this head. Rea&s;on,
like the famous concave mirrour at Paris, would, in
two minutes, vitrify all the Jew's pack: I mean,
that it would immediately de&s;troy all the form, co|lour,
and beauty, of everything that is not merely
<PB N="174" REF="183">
u&s;eful.&mdash;But I ramble too far, and you do not want
&s;uch &s;peculations. My intent, when I &s;at down,
was to tell you, that I &s;hall probably &s;ee you very

<OPENER>Dear Mr.&mdash;,</OPENER>
<P>WITH the utmo&s;t gratitude for the ob&s;er|vations
which you &s;ent me, and with the
highe&s;t opinion of their propriety in general, do I
&s;it down to an&s;wer your obliging letter. You will
not take it ami&s;s, I know, if I &s;cribble broken hints,
and trace out little &s;ketches of my mind, ju&s;t as I
&s;hould go near to explain it if I were upon the &s;pot,
as often as I think of you, which I beg leave to a&s;|&s;ure
you happens many times in a day. They &s;ay,
&startq;A word to the wi&s;e is enough;&endq; a word, there|fore,
to a friend of under&s;tanding may be &s;uppo&s;ed
to be &s;omething more than enough, becau&s;e it is
probable he is acquainted with three parts of one's
<PB N="175" REF="184">
mind before.&mdash;The cen&s;ure you have pa&s;&s;ed upon
Milton's Lycidas, &s;o far as it regards the metre which
he has cho&s;en, is unexceptionably ju&s;t; and one
would imagine, if that argument concerning the
di&s;tance of the rhimes were pre&s;&s;ed home in a pub|lic
e&s;&s;ay, it &s;hould be &s;ufficient to extirpate that kind
of ver&s;e for ever. As to my opinion concerning the
choice of Engli&s;h metre, I dare not touch upon the
&s;ubject; and I will give you my rea&s;on: I began upon
it in a letter which I intended for you about a month
ago; and I &s;oon found that I had filled a &s;heet of
paper with my di&s;&s;ertation, and left no room for
other things which I had more mind to communicate.
Be&s;ide, I found it &s;o blotted that I did not chu&s;e
to &s;end it; and as the &s;ubject is &s;o extremely co|pious,
I &s;hall decline it entirely, till <HI>talking</HI> may
prove as effectual as <HI>writing.</HI>&mdash;As to your advice
with regard to my publications, I believe it to be
ju&s;t, and &s;hall, in all probability, pur&s;ue it.&mdash;I am
afraid, by your account, that Dod&s;ley has publi&s;hed
my name to &startq;The School-mi&s;tre&s;s.&endq; I was a good
deal di&s;plea&s;ed at his publi&s;hing that poem without my
knowledge, when he had &s;o many opportunities of
giving me &s;ome previous information; but, as he
would probably di&s;regard my re&s;entment, I cho&s;e
to &s;tifle it, and wrote to him directly upon the re|ceipt
of yours, that I would be glad to furni&s;h him
with an improved copy of &startq;The School-mi&s;tre&s;s,&endq; &amp;c.
for his &s;econd edition. He accepts it with &s;ome
<PB N="176" REF="185">
complai&s;ance, de&s;ires it &s;oon; and I am at a fault
to have the opinion of my friends, what alterations
or additions it will be proper to in&s;ert. I have &s;crib|bled
a copy, which I &s;end this day to Mr. Graves
and Mr. Whi&s;tler; bat I am greatly fearful I &s;hall
not receive their critici&s;ms time enough, and I &s;hall
have the &s;ame longing for yours. A journey to
Whitchurch, which I have long propo&s;ed, might
unite all the&s;e advantages; and I heartily wi&s;h I

<P>WHAT a &s;tupid fool was I, to &s;hew you tho&s;e
letters of my friend Graves, wherein he de|clares
him&s;elf &s;o freely again&s;t a regular corre|spondence!
See the effects of it! You have taken im|mediate
advantage of his example, and I mu&s;t never
more expect an an&s;wer to any letter that I &s;end you,
<PB N="177" REF="186">
in le&s;s than half a century. I wrote to you after
I came home, to thank you for all your kindne&s;s
at I&mdash;, &amp;c.; but not a &s;yllable have I been able
to receive from you, or a word that I could hear
concerning you. I could, however, very ea&s;ily con|vince
you, that Mr. Graves (your precedent) is not
altogether &s;o hardened an offender as you may ima|gine.
His la&s;t letter is a very affectionate recan|tation.
I inclo&s;e that part of it which regards
Mr. F&mdash;</P>
<P>WHAT a number of &s;chemes are irreparably broken
by the &s;udden death of the Prince of Wales! Yours,
my good friend, which &s;eems to be de&s;troyed among&s;t

Your intere&s;t in Mr. N&mdash;will remain the &s;ame, I
<HI>&s;uppo&s;e;</HI> and if he would but &s;erve you nearer <HI>home;</HI>
I will have no &s;ort of quarrel with him that he did
not tran&s;plant you into Cornwall.&mdash;It is at lea&s;t &s;ome

the more <HI>ambitious</HI> hopes of more <HI>a&s;piring</HI> people as
liable to be &s;uddenly extingui&s;hed as one's own.
However, the death of the Prince gave me a good
deal of concern, though it no way affected my <HI>par|ticular</HI>

and generous qualities, which could recommend him
to one's <HI>affection.</HI></P>

MR. Graves has &s;ent me two copies of ver&s;es.
One on Medals, to Mr. Walker; and the other, on

<HEAD>LXIV. To Mr. GRAVES.</HEAD>
<OPENER>Dear Mr. Graves,
The Lea&s;owe&s;
<DATE>Feb. 16, 1750-1.</DATE></OPENER>
<P>SINCE I received your letter, I have been a week
at W&mdash;. I believe I may have told you, that
I never was fond of that place. There is too much
trivial elegance, too much punctilio for me; and
perhaps, as you expre&s;s it, too much <HI>&s;peculation.</HI>
But I was fearful I might entirely lo&s;e Mr. Whi&s;tler's
acquaintance, if I did not make, an effort once in
five years to return his vi&s;it. Be&s;ides, I &s;hould have
had no hopes of &s;eeing him at The Lea&s;owes here|after;
and I am extremely de&s;irous of &s;eeing both
<HI>him</HI> and <HI>you</HI> here, having made many alterations
which I do not undertake but with an eye to the
approbation of my more ingenious friends; but he
&s;eems, to my great &s;urprize, to renounce the thing
called <HI>ta&s;te</HI> in buildings, gardens, &amp;c. is grown
weary of his own little embelli&s;hments at W&mdash;, and
longs to &s;ettle in London for the greater part of his
time. This, I believe, he would put in execution
immediately; but that he thinks it might give &s;ome
unea&s;ine&s;s to his mother, if he &s;hould quit the hou&s;e
that &s;he with &s;o much difficulty obtained for him.
<HI>I</HI> too am sick of the word <HI>ta&s;te;</HI> but I think the
<HI>thing</HI> it&s;elf the only proper <HI>ambition,</HI> and the <HI>&s;pecific
plea&s;ure</HI> of all who have any &s;hare in the faculty of
imagination. I need not mention my rea&s;ons; you
<PB N="181" REF="190">
will &s;oon conceive them. And, however the ca&s;e
be, there is one branch of it which &s;o totally en|gro&s;&s;es
the per&s;ons with whom I principally con|ver&s;e,
that I was a&s;toni&s;hed to hear him &s;peak even
with indifference concerning the reigning ta&s;te for
rural decorations. I could ill forbear telling Mr.
Whi&s;tler, that he was now <HI>litterally</HI> a beau in a band|box;
but the freedom might have given more of|fence
than the joke was worth. He has improved
the place extremely; but I do not like his colon|nades.
You know, nothing of that kind is tolera|ble,
unle&s;s regularly executed in &s;tone: that is one
thing. Another is, that colonnades are ornaments
which will not <HI>bear</HI> to be very <HI>diminutive.</HI> Mr.&mdash;
(who&s;e hou&s;e only I &s;aw) has been at the expence
of a large cornice round it, in mo&s;t elaborate brick|work;
but with regard to his &s;tucco-work <HI>within</HI>
doors, he is quite <HI>extravagant.</HI>&mdash;I mention the&s;e
things upon a &s;uppo&s;ition that you may like to
hear <HI>any</HI> thing that regards the place; but indeed
they are &s;o mighty trifling, that I ought to doubt
my &s;uppo&s;ition. I &s;upped with Mr. P&mdash;'s fa|mily
once at Mr. W&mdash;'s, and once at Mr. W&mdash;'s,
and all was mighty well; only I happen to have
a violent aver&s;ion to card-playing, and at W&mdash;
I think they do nothing <HI>el&s;e:</HI> &s;o that, on account
of my ignorance at quadrille, or any creditable
game, I was forced to lo&s;e my money, and two
evenings out of my &s;even, at Pope Joan with Mr.
<PB N="182" REF="191">
P&mdash;'s children. Mr. W&mdash;, to make me
amends, invited me to breakfa&s;t, and &s;hewed me
your ver&s;es. I a&s;&s;ure you, you have no occa&s;ion for
a better advocate than Mr. W&mdash;; whether with re|gard
to his <HI>judgement,</HI> or his zeal in behalf of the
&s;ubject, the ver&s;es, or the poet. I would fain have
obtained a copy; but he did not care to give one
without your commi&s;&s;ion. I hope <HI>you</HI> will oblige
me &s;o far. I like them very much; the &s;ubject
is genteel, and the ver&s;es ea&s;y and elegant. We
agreed upon one or two different readings; and one
&s;tanza that concerns cards &s;hould, I think, be cor|rected.
Not that I would have you le&s;s &s;evere upon
cards neither; I was even glad to find, that you
gave them &s;o little quarter. I &s;ometimes thought
that Mr. W&mdash;'s &s;eeming fondne&s;s for them was a
kind of <HI>contre-coeur.</HI>&mdash;Be that as it will, his ob|jection
to the &s;tanza, as well as mine, was &s;olely
founded on the ver&s;ification, not the &s;entiment. I
liked his Latin ver&s;es; but they do not interfere
with yours. Send me a copy, and confine my u&s;e
of it by what limitations you plea&s;e. My reigning
toy at pre&s;ent is a pocket-book; and I glory as
much in furni&s;hing it with the ver&s;es of my ac|quaintance,
as others would with bank-bills. I did
not know when I went to W&mdash;, but I might have
heard Mrs. G&mdash;<HI>accu&s;ed of certain que&s;tions touching
their law</HI> (I mean of forms and ceremonies); but I
did <HI>not.</HI> On the contrary, I had the &s;atisfaction of
<PB N="183" REF="192">
hearing her per&s;on, her temper, and her under&s;tand|ing,
much commended; but this I did not want:
the delicacy of your ta&s;te is equal with me to a
thou&s;and commendations. Mrs. W&mdash;is really &s;o
much altered by her indi&s;po&s;ition, that I did not
know her. She talks of going to Bath this &s;ea&s;on;&mdash;
I talked of it too, and wi&s;h it of all earthly things.
You mu&s;t know, I could not have come to Claver|ton
<HI>in&s;tead</HI> of going to W&mdash;, as I did not determine
on the expedition at home; but at a friend's hou&s;e,
where I was betwixt twenty and thirty miles on my
way thither. Be&s;ides, I would allow my&s;elf more
time when I turn my face towards Bath, than I
could this winter. Your invitation, as it is very
obliging, &s;o it has many concurring circum&s;tances to
recommend it at this time. I want to recover my
health, which mu&s;t be recovered by Bath, or <HI>nothing;</HI>
I want to have you read &s;ome trifles of mine, which
mu&s;t be ratified by you, or <HI>no one;</HI> but principally,
and above all, do I long to &s;ee you, my old friend,
and Mrs. G&mdash;, whom I expect you &s;hould render
my new one.&mdash;I am obliged for your charitable en|deavours
to &s;upport my &s;pirits. Your company
would do it effectually, but &s;carce any thing le&s;s, in
<HI>winter.</HI> Solitary life, limited circum&s;tances, a phleg|matic
habit, and di&s;agreeable events, have given me
a melancholy turn, that is hardly di&s;&s;ipated by the
mo&s;t &s;erene &s;ky; but in a north-ea&s;t wind is quite
intolerable, After a long &s;tate of this kind, upon
<PB N="184" REF="193">
every acce&s;s of amu&s;ement, one is apt to think it is
not <HI>right</HI> to be happy; that it is one of Wolla&s;ton's
implicit lyes; a treating things contrary to what
they <HI>de&s;erve.</HI>&mdash;Your &s;ituation at Claverton is admired
by mo&s;t people; and, if you could connect &s;ome
little matter in the neighbourhood, would be as
&s;urely envied.</P>

<OPENER>Dear Mr. G&mdash;,
The Lea&s;owes,
<DATE>Sept. 17, 1751.</DATE></OPENER>
<P>I AM very &s;en&s;ibly obliged to you for the <HI>diligence</HI>
and <HI>expedition</HI> which you have &s;hewn in an&s;wer|ing
my late reque&s;t: I cannot feel the very <HI>tender|ne&s;s</HI>
of friend&s;hip to be at all abated in me by our
long &s;eparation; nor will it at any time be po&s;&s;ible
I &s;hould, &s;o long as I receive &s;uch te&s;timonies of your
u&s;ual <HI>kindne&s;s</HI> and <HI>ingenuity.</HI>&mdash;I have no &s;ort of ex|captions
to make again&s;t the province in which you
were engaged at Cheltenham, nor the light in which
you appeared. What you lo&s;t in any one's opinion
<PB N="186" REF="195">
of your independency, you would gain in their idea
of your merit, genius, and learning; and then you
had all tho&s;e other advantages <HI>par di&s;&s;u.</HI>&mdash;As to the
compliments that were paid to Mrs. G&mdash;, you have
&s;omething of the &s;ame &s;ort of rea&s;on to be plea&s;ed
with them, that I have to be plea&s;ed with tho&s;e
that are given to my place; which I con&s;ider as
naturally po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of many beauties, each of them
brought to light and perfected through my own
di&s;cernment, care, and cultivation. And then your
plea&s;ure ought, to be &s;o much greater than mine,
as you have a nobler &s;ubject to enjoy.&mdash;Mrs. G&mdash;
has too much &s;en&s;e to object again&s;t the freedom of
this &s;imilitude.</P>
<P>I CANNOT help adding a few &s;trokes to your
picture of Mrs. S&mdash;. I think her an extremely <HI>&s;u|perficial</HI>
female-pedant: for, after an interval of many
years &s;ince I fir&s;t conver&s;ed with her at Mr.&mdash;'s,
I found her conver&s;ation turn &s;olely upon the &s;ame
<HI>topics, definitions,</HI> and <HI>quotations.</HI> I believe, I could
ea&s;ily enough have recommended my&s;elf; to a greater
degree of her favour; but her vanity and affecta|tions
were beyond what I could bear.&mdash;Your ac|count
of&mdash;is very picture&s;que, and agreeable to
the idea I always had of him; but I believe that
idea was perfected by what ob&s;ervations I made when
I had &s;ome of his company at London.&mdash;There was
&s;omething accountable enough to me in their bur|le&s;quing
<PB N="187" REF="196">
Mr. L&mdash;'s monody. He is, you know,
engaged in a party; and his poem (though an ex|traordinary
fine compo&s;ition) was too tender for the
public ear. It &s;hould have been printed privately,
and a number of copies di&s;per&s;ed only among their
friends and acquaintance;&mdash;but even &s;o it would
have been re-publi&s;hed; and it was too good to
&s;uppre&s;s. I wi&s;h the burle&s;quers of &s;uch <HI>ingenuous</HI>

<P>I HEARD, once before, it was burle&s;qued under
the title of &startq;An Elegy on the Death of a favou|rite
Cat;&endq; but the burle&s;que will die, and the
poem will &s;urvive.&mdash;You tell me, &startq;The Author of
Peregrine Pickle &s;ays, if you will flatter Mr. Lyt|telton
well, he will at la&s;t make you a Middle&s;ex
Ju&s;tice;&endq; and it happened oddly that, whil&s;t I
was reading your letter, a neighbour told me, I was
put in the commi&s;&s;ion of the peace. I have never
received a &s;ingle line from Mr. Whi&s;tler, and I be|lieve
my journey to W&mdash;has given the final blow
to our friend&s;hip. Pray was not Mr. Blandy &s;ome
relation of theirs, or only their attorney? The af|fair

fair is uncommonly &s;hocking; and I fancy the <HI>ge|nuine</HI>
accounts that Mr. W&mdash;&s;ends you will be cu|rious
anecdotes at Bath.&mdash;I &s;uppo&s;e you have painted
your room with oil colours, and made it <HI>really</HI> hand|&s;ome.&mdash;
I drew out a fe&s;toon and a medal &s;ome time
ago, for a pannel over Mr. P&mdash;'s chimney; but they
knew not what to make of the medal, and had only
the fe&s;toon executed in &s;tone colour, by a common
painter;&mdash;yours is better, and in character.&mdash;I am
a degree more frugal than you; for I only u&s;e quick
lime, and either blue or yellow &s;and, to take away
the objection which I have to whited walls.</P>
<P>I PAID a vi&s;it to Mr. Lyttelton, the Dean, &amp;c.
&s;ince he came down; but had little of their com|pany,
for they thought Sir Thomas was dying:
however, by unparalleled &s;trength of con&s;titution,
he lingered in violent pain till la&s;t Saturday, when
he died, very much lamented. He had good na|tural
parts, well improved by reading modern writers,
and by the knowledge of the world: extremely pru|dent,
con&s;iderate, humane, polite, and charitable.&mdash;
I have jumbled his more obvious qualities together,
that you may not think I am u&s;urping the province
of a news-man. Sir George will lo&s;e no time in
building a new hou&s;e, or doing what is more than

<HEAD>LXVI. To Mr: GRAVES, on the Death of Mr.
SHENSTONE'S Brother.</HEAD>
<OPENER>Dear Mr. Graves,
The Lea&s;owes,
<DATE>Feb. 14, 1752.</DATE></OPENER>
<P>YOU will be amazed at my long &s;ilence; and
it might rea&s;onably excite &s;ome di&s;gu&s;t if my
days had pa&s;&s;ed of late in the manner they u&s;ed to
do: but I am not the man I was; perhaps I never
<PB N="190" REF="199">
<HI>&s;hall</HI> be. Alas! my deare&s;t friend! I have lo&s;t my
only brother! and, &s;ince the fatal clo&s;e of Novem|ber,
I have had neither peace nor re&s;pite from agoniz|ing
thoughts!</P>
<P>You, I think, have <HI>&s;een</HI> my brother; but perhaps
had no opportunity of di&s;tingui&s;hing him from the
groupe of others whom we call <HI>good-natured</HI> men.
This part of his character was &s;o vi&s;ible in his
countenance, that he was generally beloved at &s;ight;
<HI>I,</HI> who mu&s;t be allowed to know him, do a&s;&s;ure you,
that his under&s;tanding was no way inferior to his
benevolence. He had not only a found judgement,
but a lively wit and genuine humour. As the&s;e
were many-times eclip&s;ed by his native ba&s;hfulne&s;s,
&s;o his benevolence only &s;uffered by being &s;hewn to
an exce&s;s. I here mean his giving too indi&s;crimi|nately
into tho&s;e jovial meetings of company, where
the warmth of a &s;ocial temper is di&s;covered with
lea&s;t re&s;erve; but the virtues of his head and heart
would &s;oon have &s;hone without alloy. The foibles
of his youth were wearing off; and his affection for
me and regard to my advice, with his own good
&s;en&s;e, would &s;oon have rendered him all that I could
have wi&s;hed in a &s;ucce&s;&s;or. I never in my life knew
a per&s;on more &s;incere in the expre&s;&s;ion of his love
or di&s;like. But it was the <HI>former</HI> that &s;uited the
propen&s;ity of his heart; the <HI>latter</HI> was as tran&s;ient
as the &s;tarts of pa&s;&s;ion that occa&s;ioned it. In &s;hort,
<PB N="191" REF="200">
with much true genius and real fortitude, he was,
according to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> acceptation, &startq;a truly ho|ne&s;t
man;&endq; and I think I may al&s;o add, a truly
Engli&s;h character; but &startq;habeo, dixi? immo <HI>habui</HI>
&startq;fratrem &amp; amicum, Chreme!&endq; All this have I
<HI>lo&s;t</HI> in him. He is now in regard to <HI>this</HI> world no
more than a mere idea; and this idea, therefore,
though deeply tinged with melancholy, I mu&s;t, and
&s;urely <HI>ought</HI> to, cheri&s;h and pre&s;erve.</P>
<P>I BELIEVE I wrote you &s;ome account of his illne&s;s
la&s;t &s;pring; from which to all appearance he was
tolerably well recovered. He took the air, and
vi&s;ited about with me, during the warmer months
of &s;ummer; but my plea&s;ure was of &s;hort duration.
&startq;Hae&s;it lateri lethalis arundo!&endq; The peripneumony
under which he laboured in the &s;pring had termi|nated
in an adhe&s;ion of the lungs to the pleura, &s;o
that he could never lie but upon his right &s;ide; and
this, as the weather grew colder, occa&s;ioned an ob|&s;truction
that could never be &s;urmounted.</P>
<P>THOUGH my rea&s;on forewarned me of the event,
I was not the more prepared for it.&mdash;Let me not
dwell upon it.&mdash;It is altogether in&s;upportable in
<HI>every re&s;pect;</HI> and my imagination &s;eems more a&s;|&s;iduous
in educing pain from this occa&s;ion, than I
ever yet found it in admini&s;tering to my plea&s;ure.&mdash;
This hurts me to no purpo&s;e&mdash;I know it; and yet,
<PB N="192" REF="201">
when I have avocated my thoughts, and fixed them
for a while upon common amu&s;ements, I &s;uffer the
&s;ame &s;ort of con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s as if I were guilty of a
crime. Believe me, this has been the mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible
affliction I ever felt in my life; and you, who know
my anxiety when I had far le&s;s rea&s;on to complain,
will more ea&s;ily <HI>conceive</HI> it now, than I am able to
de&s;cribe it.</P>
<P>I CANNOT pretend to fill up my paper with my
u&s;ual &s;ubjects.&mdash;I &s;hould thank you for your re|marks
upon my poetry; but I de&s;pi&s;e poetry: and
I might tell you of all my little rural improve|ments;
but I hate them.&mdash;What can I now expect
from my &s;olitary rambles through them, but a &s;eries
of melancholy reflections and irk&s;ome anticipations?&mdash;
Even the plea&s;ure, I &s;hould take in &s;hewing them
to <HI>you,</HI> the greate&s;t they can afford me, mu&s;t be now
greatly inferior to what it might formerly have been.</P>
<P>How have I pro&s;tituted my &s;orrow on occa&s;ions
that little concerned me! I am a&s;hamed to think
of that idle &startq;Elegy upon Autumm,&endq; when I have
&s;o much more important cau&s;e to hate and to con|demn
it <HI>now;</HI> but the glare and gaiety of the Spring
is what I <HI>principally</HI> dread; when I &s;hall find all
things re&s;tored but my poor brother, and &s;omething
like tho&s;e lines of Milton will run for ever in my
thoughts:
<Q><PB N="193" REF="202">
<L>&startq;Thus, with the year,</L>
<L><HI>Sea&s;ons</HI> return; but not to <HI>me</HI> returns</L>
<L>A brother's cordial &s;mile, at eve or morn.&endq;</L></Q>
I &s;hall then &s;eem to wake from amu&s;ements, com|pany,
every <HI>&s;ort</HI> of inebriation with which I have
been endeavouring to lull my grief a&s;leep, as from
a dream; and I &s;hall feel as if I were, <HI>that in&s;tant,</HI>
de&s;poiled of all I have chiefly valued for thirty years
together; of all my pre&s;ent happine&s;s, and all my
future pro&s;pects. The melody of birds, which he
no more mu&s;t hear; the chearful beams of the &s;un,
of which he no more mu&s;t partake; <HI>every</HI> wonted
plea&s;ure will produce that <HI>&s;ort</HI> of pain to which my
temper is mo&s;t obnoxious. Do not con&s;ider this as
poetry.&mdash;Poetry on &s;uch occa&s;ions is no more than
literal truth. In the pre&s;ent ca&s;e it is <HI>le&s;s;</HI> for half
the tenderne&s;s I feel is altogether &s;hapele&s;s and in|expre&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>AFTER all, the wi&s;dom of the world may per|haps
e&s;teem me a gainer. Ill do they judge of this
event, who think that any &s;hadow of amends can be
made for the death of a brother, and the di&s;appoint|ment
of all my &s;chemes, by the acce&s;&s;ion of &s;ome
fortune, which I never can enjoy!</P>
<P>THIS is a mournful narrative: I will not, there|fore,
enlarge it.&mdash;Among&s;t all changes and chances,
I often think of you; and pray there may be no

<HEAD>LXIX To Mr. G&mdash;, on the Receipt of his Picture.</HEAD>
<OPENER>Dear Mr. G&mdash;,
The Lea&s;owes,
<DATE>Oct. 3, 1752</DATE></OPENER>
<P>I AM very unfeignedly a&s;hamed to reflect how long
it is &s;ince I received your pre&s;ent, and how much
longer it is &s;ince I received your letter. I have been
re&s;olving to write to you almo&s;t daily ever &s;ince you
left me; yet have fooli&s;hly enough permitted avo|cations
(of infinitely le&s;s importance than your cor|re&s;pondence)
to interfere with my gratitude, my in|tere&s;t,
and my inclination. What apology I have to
make, though no way adequate to my negligence,
is in &s;hort as follows. After the receipt of your
letter, I deferred writing till I could &s;peak of the
arrival of your picture.&mdash;This did not happen till
about a month or five weeks ago, when I was em|barra&s;&s;ed
with ma&s;ons, carvers, carpenters, and com|pany,
<PB N="199" REF="208">
all at a time. And though it were idle enough
to &s;ay, that I could not find <HI>one</HI> vacant hour for my
purpo&s;e, yet in truth my head was &s;o confu&s;ed by
the&s;e multifarious di&s;tractions, that I could have writ|ten
nothing &s;atisfactory either to <HI>my&s;elf</HI> or <HI>you:</HI> no|thing
worth a &s;ingle <HI>penny,</HI> &s;uppo&s;ing the po&s;tage
were to co&s;t you no more. The workmen had not
<HI>fini&s;hed my rooms</HI> a minute, when Lady Luxborough,
Mrs. Davies, and Mr. Outing arrived, with <HI>five</HI>
&s;ervants and a <HI>&s;et</HI> of hor&s;es, to &s;tay with me for
&s;ome time. After a nine days vi&s;it, I returned with
them to Barrels, where I continued for a week;
and whither (by the way) I go again with Lord Dud|ley
in about a fortnight's time. Other company fil|led
up the inter&s;tices of my &s;ummer; and I hope
my dear friend will accept of this apology for &s;o
long a cha&s;m of &s;ilence, during which I have been
uniformly at his &s;ervice, and true to that inviolable
friend&s;hip I &s;hall ever bear him.</P>
<P>I PROCEED now to thank you for the <HI>di&s;tinction</HI>
you &s;hew me, in &s;ending me your picture: I do it

my Lady Luxborough with all her &s;ervants that have
<HI>&s;een you</HI> pronounce, as well as I; con&s;equently more
valuable to a <HI>friend</HI> than a face he does not know,
though it were one of Raphael's. The &s;mile about
the mouth is bad; as it agrees but ill with the
gravity of the eyes, and as a &s;mile ever &s;o little
<PB N="200" REF="209">

it is <HI>tran&s;itory.</HI> However, this may be altered, when
I can meet with a good painter. I have no <HI>other</HI>
objection, but to the prominence of the belly. The
hair, I think, is good; and the coat and band no
way exceptionable. I have given it all the advan|tage
I can: it has a good light, and makes part of
an elegant chimney-piece in a genteel, though lit|tle
breakfa&s;t-room, at the end of my hou&s;e.</P>
<P>MR. Whi&s;tler and I are now upon good terms,

<P>LADY Luxborough &s;aid very extraordinary things

<OPENER>Dear Mr. Jago,

<P>COULD I with convenience mount my hor&s;e,
and ride to Harbury this in&s;tant, I &s;hould much
more willingly do &s;o than begin this letter. Such ter|rible
events have happened to us, &s;ince we &s;aw each
other la&s;t, that, however irk&s;ome it may be to dwell
upon them, it is in the &s;ame degree unnatural to
&s;ub&s;titute any &s;ubject in their place.</P>
<P>I DO &s;incerely forgive your long &s;ilence, my good
friend, indeed I do; though it gave me unea&s;ine&s;s. I
hope you do the &s;ame by mine. I own, I could not
readily account for the <HI>former</HI> period of yours, any
otherwi&s;e than by &s;uppo&s;ing that I had &s;aid or done
&s;omething, in the levity of my heart, which had given
you di&s;gu&s;t; but being con&s;cious to my&s;elf of the
mo&s;t &s;incere regard for you, and believing it could
never be di&s;credited for any <HI>trivial</HI> inadvertencies, I
remember, I continued &s;till in expectation of a letter,
and did not dream of writing till &s;uch time as I had
<PB N="203" REF="212">
received one. I tru&s;ted you would write at <HI>la&s;t;</HI> and
that, by all my pa&s;t endeavours to demon&s;trate my
<HI>friend&s;hip,</HI> you would believe the <HI>tree</HI> was rooted in
my heart, whatever irregularity you might ob&s;erve in
the <HI>branches.</HI></P>
<P>THIS was my &s;ituation before that dreadful aera
which gave me &s;uch a &s;hock as to bani&s;h my be&s;t
friends for a time out of my memory. And when they
recurred, as they did the fir&s;t of any thing, I was made
acquainted with that deplorable misfortune of yours!
Believe me, I &s;ympathized in <HI>your</HI> affliction, nothwith|&s;tanding
my own; but alas! what comfort could I
admini&s;ter, who had need of every po&s;&s;ible a&s;&s;i&s;tance to
&s;upport my&s;elf? I wrote indeed a few letters with
<HI>difficulty;</HI> among&s;t the re&s;t, one to my friend Graves;
but it was to vent my complaint.&mdash;I will &s;end you the
letter, if you plea&s;e, as it is by far my lea&s;t painful
method of conveying you &s;ome account of my &s;itua|tion.
Let it convince you, that I could have written
nothing at that time, which could have been of any
&s;ervice to you: let it afford you, at lea&s;t, a faint
&s;ketch of my deare&s;t brother's character; but let it not
appear an o&s;tentatious di&s;play of &s;orrow, of which I
am by no means guilty. I know but too well that I
di&s;covered upon the occa&s;ion, what &s;ome would call,
an unmanly tenderne&s;s; but I know al&s;o, that &s;orrow
upon &s;uch &s;ubjects as the&s;e is very con&s;i&s;tent with vir|tue,
and with the mo&s;t ab&s;olute re&s;ignation to the ju&s;t

decrees of Providence&mdash;&startq;Hominis e&s;t enim affici do|lore,
<HI>&s;entire;</HI> re&s;i&s;tere tamen &amp; &s;olatia admittere,
non &s;olatiis non egere.&endq; Pliny.&mdash;I drank, pur|cha&s;ed
amu&s;ements, never &s;uffered my&s;elf to be a mi|nute
without company, no matter what, &s;o it was but
continual. At length, by an attention to &s;uch con|ver&s;ation
and &s;uch amu&s;ements as I could at other
times de&s;pi&s;e, I forgot &s;o far as to be chearful.&mdash;And
after this, the &s;ummer, through an almo&s;t con&s;tant
&s;ucce&s;&s;ion of lively and agreeable vi&s;itants, proved
even a &s;cene of jollity.&mdash;It was inebriation all, though
of a mingled nature; yet has it maintained a &s;ort of
truce with grief, till time can a&s;&s;i&s;t me more effectu|ally
by throwing back the event to a di&s;tance.&mdash;
Now, indeed, that my company has all for&s;aken me,
and I am delivered up to winter, &s;ilence, and reflec|tion,
the incidents of the la&s;t year revive apace in my
memory; and I am even a&s;toni&s;hed to think of the
gaiety of my &s;ummer. The fatal anniver&s;ary, the
&startq;dies quem &s;emper acerbum, &amp;c.&endq; is beginning to
approach, and every face of the &s;ky &s;ugge&s;ts the ideas
of la&s;t winter.&mdash;Yet I find my&s;elf; chearful in <HI>company;</HI>
nor would I recommend it to you to be much alone.&mdash;
You would lay the highe&s;t obligation upon me by
coming over at this time.&mdash;I pre&s;&s;ed your brother,
whom I &s;aw at Birmingham, to u&s;e his influence with
you; but if you can by no means undertake the jour|ney,
I will take my &s;peedie&s;t opportunity of &s;eeing
you at Harbury.&mdash;Mr. Miller invited me &s;trenuou&s;ly
<PB N="205" REF="214">
to meet Dr. Lyttelton at his hou&s;e; but I believe my
mo&s;t convenient &s;ea&s;on will be, when my Lord Dud|ley
goes to Barrels; for I can but ill bear the pen&s;ive|ne&s;s
of a long and lonely expedition. After all, if
you <HI>could</HI> come hither fir&s;t, it would afford me the
mo&s;t entire &s;atisfaction.&mdash;I have been making altera|tions
in my hou&s;e that would amu&s;e you; and have
many matters to di&s;cour&s;e with you, which it would
be endle&s;s to mention upon paper.&mdash;Adieu! my dear

<OPENER>Dear Mr. Graves,
The Lea&s;owes,
<DATE>July 15, 1753.</DATE></OPENER>
<P>I SEND you my Ode, as I &s;ent it to the Dutche&s;s
&s;ome weeks ago. Why I pitched upon one read|ing
&s;ooner than another, I will not now explain:
nor will I trouble you to make any fre&s;h remarks
upon it at pre&s;ent; only, when you happen to read
it over at your lei&s;ure, if any thing occurs to you
that would tend to perfect It, I would beg you oc|ca&s;ionally
to make &s;ome memorandums. I have not
yet received an an&s;wer; but, as I accompanied the
ver&s;es with a letter, I &s;uppo&s;e I &s;hall receive one
in return. I al&s;o added, to fill a blank &s;pace in my
paper-book, a poem which I call &startq;The Vi&s;ta;&endq;
and which you may perhaps recollect: how pro|perly
I know not, for I had the benefit of no per&s;on's
<HI>judgement</HI> or advice.</P>
<P>LORD Dudley made Mr. Dolman a pre&s;ent of a
piece of plate, a large cup, in con&s;ideration of his
&s;i&s;ter's being at Broom about half a year. There
was on it, one &s;upporter awkwardly enough hold|ing
up the coronet in his paw, and from the co|ronet
proceeded a label, with &startq;Amoris ergo Dud|ley.&endq;
I do not know who was the manager, or
whence he had the in&s;cription; but I think from
<PB N="218" REF="227">
Dr. H&mdash;. This is <HI>elegant</HI> and <HI>enough.</HI> Neverthele&s;s,
as there may be &s;ome convenience in dazzling the
eyes of the people where I dwell, and as <HI>&s;uch</HI> eyes
as theirs are net to be dazzled, and hardly <HI>&s;truck,</HI>
by <HI>$legance</HI> alone, I cho&s;e the method that was mo&s;t
<HI>magnificent.</HI>&mdash;I wi&s;h they are not invidious enough
to &s;ay, that <HI>his</HI> arms are engraved there for want of
&s;ome of my <HI>own:</HI> &s;o I would not be long before
I remove their notable &s;ugge&s;tion.&mdash;I have truly &s;o
low an opinion of arms &s;ince they became purcha&s;ea|ble
by money, and &s;ince the pre&s;ent unlimited u&s;e
of them, that, were I to find a coat to my name in
the office which I did not like, I would not u&s;e it;
but &s;ub&s;titute what was more agreeable: yet &s;ome
<HI>&s;ort</HI> of <HI>right</HI> or <HI>claim</HI> is requi&s;ite to &s;atisfy one's de|licacy
with an opinion of <HI>property;</HI> and indeed to
fix one's <HI>choice,</HI> where one has the whole furniture
of the univer&s;e for <HI>its</HI> object.&mdash;After all, the vulgar
are more &s;truck with arms than any thing; &startq;&s;tupet
in titu$is &amp; imaginibus;&endq; and, I believe, there
were near two hundred people gathered round Lady
Luxborough's landeau at Birmingham, and declaring
her arms to be very <HI>noble,</HI> or otherwi&s;e.&mdash;I do not,
therefore, chu&s;e to employ a vulgar <HI>mind</HI> about this
matter.&mdash;Were you to go to London, I &s;hould gladly
&s;olici <HI>you;</HI> or if you have any friend you could write
to in town, to &s;earch the office; for really I have
none that I like <HI>for the purpo&s;e.</HI> It will not co&s;t

really do not know what Mr. Hylton will put upon
it: I find, he con&s;ults with Dr. B&mdash;, my Lord's phy|&s;ician.&mdash;
&startq;<HI>De</HI> Dudley&endq; would run most abomina|bly,
and &startq;Baro Dudley&endq; may be authorized by the
frequent practice of Maittaire.&mdash;If it is in&s;cribed
&startq;Dudley&endq; <HI>alone,</HI> I can add the re&s;t if I &s;hould here|after
think proper; and I wi&s;h it may be &s;o.</P>
<P>MY ver&s;es to the Colonel are not yet tran&s;cribed.</P>
<P>I THINK the Latin in&s;cription to your brother
very elegant; and I &s;hould not care to have any

this little hi&s;tory of his life perpetuated&mdash;&startq;His
&s;altem, &amp;c.&endq; And were you to put it into Eng|li&s;h,
it would be too long for an in&s;cription; un|le&s;s
you were, by means of a printed elegy with
notes, or any other &s;uch method, to produce the
&s;ame effect; and then you might make the epitaph
as &s;hort as you plea&s;ed.&mdash;After all, the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> method
is perhaps as eligible. When the affair is nearer
a conclu&s;ion, I &s;hould be glad to be of any &s;ervice.&mdash;
I will think, and write again about it.</P>

<HEAD>LXXV. To Mr. JAGO.</HEAD>
<OPENER>Dear Mr. Jago,
The Lea&s;owes,
<DATE>Jan. 29, 1754.</DATE></OPENER>
<P>I AM at a lo&s;s how to begin this letter.&mdash;I will
not, however, after the u&s;ual way, give you a
tedious li&s;t of <HI>apologies</HI> in the front of it. Some ac|count
of my long &s;ilence you will find di&s;per&s;ed
throughout the letter; and as for what is deficient,
I will depend upon your friend&s;hip.</P>
<P>THERE has not been a per&s;on here, &s;ince you left
me, of whom I could obtain the lea&s;t intelligence
concerning you. And as an enquiry by the po&s;t
was my only obvious method, I do acknowledge my|&s;elf
to blame, notwith&s;tanding all the excu&s;es that I
can make.</P>
<P>AMIDST that conflux of vi&s;itants whom I received
this la&s;t &s;ea&s;on, I was hardly once <HI>&s;o</HI> happy as I
<PB N="223" REF="232">
was in <HI>your</HI> company: I was the happier in &s;eeing
<HI>you</HI> &s;o; and, if you remember, I took notice at the
time, how little your vivacity was impaired in com|pari&s;on
of my own. If I was <HI>then</HI> but a dull <HI>com|panion;</HI>
gue&s;s whether &s;olitude and winter were likely
to make me a better <HI>corre&s;pondent.</HI> That vein of
gaiety and humour, which you were once To partial
as to di&s;cover in my letters, will &s;carce appear there
any more: not even to the eyes of the mo&s;t partial
friend I have. Should you deny what I a&s;&s;ert, and
impute it to a fit of &s;pleen, yet you may <HI>allow</HI> that
it will &s;carce enliven any letter that I write in <HI>winter.</HI>
Friend&s;hip &s;till remains! Friend&s;hip, like the root
of &s;ome perennial flower, even <HI>then</HI> perhaps gathers
&s;trength in &s;ecret, that it may afford a better di&s;play
of its colours in the &s;pring.</P>
<P>I DO not pretend this to be an adequate apology.
I know, my deare&s;t friend, that you both <HI>like</HI> to &s;ee
and hear from me: it proves, however, that you
have no great <HI>lo&s;s</HI> either of my letters or my com|pany.</P>
<P>I AM, as the phra&s;e is, deeply penetrated by the
civilities of your Mr. Miller. Me toot a &s;hort din|ner
with me once this &s;ea&s;on, dropping Sir George
at Mr. P&mdash;'s. He could not have plea&s;ed me bet|ter.
Here he happened to meet Mr. Lyttelton and
Captain Whood. He afterwards breakfa&s;ted here,
<PB N="224" REF="233">
and in general &s;eemed glad of every occa&s;ion to
bring me the genteele&s;t company. To him I owe
Mi&s;s Banks and Lord Temple. Can you think that
Radway now, as well as Harbury, has no attractions
for me? You know me too well; but I have not
truly &s;uch a &s;tate of health as to dare to be from
home. Friends will &s;ay, &startq;you may be as free at
our hou&s;es as your own, &amp;c.&endq; and they will <HI>mean</HI>
as they <HI>&s;ay;</HI> but if you cannot make <HI>your&s;elf</HI> &s;o,
what is all this to the purpo&s;e?</P>
<P>I CANNOT give you a detail of what has pa&s;&s;ed
with me &s;ince I &s;aw you. Lord Dudley, with my|&s;elf,
made one vi&s;it to Lord Plymouth's. We met
Mr. and Mrs. Winnington.&mdash;We took a trip to Mr.
Vernon's, where we found Mr. Coventry and other
company. The impre&s;&s;ions I received from them
would afford &s;ubject for <HI>conver&s;ation</HI> betwixt you and
me; but I mu&s;t not a&s;&s;ign too much of my paper to
that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>LORD Plymouth's piece of water &s;hould have been
a &s;erpentine river. I could give you &s;trong rea&s;ons.&mdash;
I think my Lord &s;uch a character as will make
a reputable figure in life&mdash;<HI>beloved</HI> he <HI>is,</HI> and <HI>mu&s;t</HI>
be at fir&s;t &s;ight.&mdash;Lady Plymouth is the mo&s;t amiable
of women; and, of all the world, the propere&s;t per|&s;on
that my Lord could have cho&s;en. The plan for
their hou&s;e I think right; &s;uppo&s;ing it right to con|tinue
<PB N="225" REF="234">
it where it is. The park is capable of &s;ome
con&s;iderable beauties. Lord Plymouth has been once
here &s;ince, and talks of cau&s;ing me to come, and de|&s;ign
for his environs.&mdash;I &s;eem to be highly in his
favour.&mdash;I hope &s;ome time to meet you there.</P>
<P>MY Ode, after an a&s;toni&s;hing delay, was pre&s;ented
to the Dutche&s;s of Somer&s;et. It produced me two
genteel letters from her Grace. I am well &s;atisfied
with the event, for &s;ome rea&s;ons which I will one
day give you&mdash;none of moment.&mdash;Soon after this,
Dod&s;ley pre&s;&s;ed me to contribute, as amply as I
plea&s;ed, to a fourth volume of his Mi&s;cellanies. I at
fir&s;t meant to do &s;o pretty largely; I then changed
my mind, and &s;ent only &s;ome little pieces. Part of
the&s;e were my own; part Mr. Whi&s;tler's, Mr.
Graves's, and &s;ome accidental pieces of others, which
I found in my bureau.&mdash;I purpo&s;ed to &s;end &s;ome|thing
of yours too; of <HI>my&s;elf,</HI> if I was <HI>hurried;</HI> el&s;e,
not without your con&s;ent. What I thought of was,
your Linnets. La&s;t week he writes me word, that
the town will now be too much engro&s;&s;ed by the
bu&s;ine&s;s of elections; and that he does not proceed
this winter.&mdash;So that we &s;hall now, you &s;ee, have
time to meet, or write upon the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>MR. Graves &s;ent me the inclo&s;ed little fable, for
Dod&s;ley, if I approved it.&mdash;I made &s;ome alterations,
and &s;ent it.&mdash;Return it to me, if you plea&s;e.&mdash;It
<PB N="226" REF="235">
is pretty; but the in&s;cription mu&s;t be &startq;To a
Friend.&endq;</P>
<P>SOME corre&s;pondence I have had this winter with
Mr. Hylton, about toys and trinkets which he gets
done for me in London. He is by far a better
<HI>friend</HI> and <HI>corre&s;pondent</HI> than a <HI>poet.</HI> Should you take
a trip to town, he would be quite <HI>proud</HI> to &s;ee you.</P>
<P>I AM now, like the re&s;t of the world, peru&s;ing Sir

<HI>joins</HI> me, in preferring Clari&s;&s;a. The author wants
the art of <HI>abridgement</HI> in every thing that he has writ|ten,
yet I am much his admirer.</P>

<HEAD>LXXVI. To Mr. GRAVES, on the Alternations of
Plea&s;ure and Pain.</HEAD>
<OPENER>Dear Mr. Graves,
The Lea&s;owes,
<DATE>April 19, 1754.</DATE></OPENER>
<P>IT is a long, long time, according to the com|putation
of friend&s;hip, &s;ince I had the plea&s;ure
of a line from you; and I write chiefly to remind you
of it, not with any hopes of affording you the
amu&s;ement of a &s;ingle minute. In truth, I have not
&s;pirits for it. The &s;everity, the duration, the &s;oli|tude,
of this winter have well-nigh exhau&s;ted them.&mdash;
The &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, the regular &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, of pain and
plea&s;ure becomes every day more clear to me. It
begins to &s;eem as ordinary as the cour&s;e of day and
night. Thus my la&s;t &s;ummer was the mo&s;t amu&s;ing
I ever &s;aw; my winter the mo&s;t di&s;agreeable&mdash;al|low
me to except one only: I mean, that ever|mournful
winter which robbed me of my deare&s;t.
relation. Sometimes this pain and plea&s;ure are con|tra&s;ted
within the compa&s;s of a day; &s;ometimes
in different weeks, &amp;c. &amp;c. However, do not think
me &s;uper&s;titious; there is hardly a per&s;on that is
<HI>le&s;s</HI> &s;o. Yet I am firmly per&s;uaded of the alternation,
either in the mind, or in the events them&s;elves. My
&s;ummer, I &s;aid before, was highly entertaining; my
winter rendered equally di&s;agreeable, by a long-con|tinued
&s;quabble among&s;t our principal pari&s;hioners,
<PB N="228" REF="237">
and by the death of my be&s;t-beloved and the mo&s;t
accompli&s;hed of my relations, M&mdash;D&mdash;. She ri&s;qued
going to London for the &s;ake of finding &s;omething
<HI>new;</HI> was &s;eized with the &s;mall-pox, and died in all
her bloom.&mdash;The natural consequence which we
&s;hould draw from ob&s;ervations of this &s;ort is, equa|nimity; &startq;aequam memento rebus, &amp;c.&endq; and again,
&startq;&s;perat infe&s;tis, metuit &s;ecundis, &amp;c.&endq; Enough of
this, which I &s;hould not mention but that the fact
it&s;elf &s;trikes me continually more and more; and
were I to mark the plea&s;ing and unplea&s;ing parts
of my exi&s;tence in an almanac, as the Romans did
their <HI>Fa&s;ti</HI> and <HI>Nefa&s;ti,</HI> I know not if, at the year's
end, the black and white marks would not nearly
balance each other.</P>
<P>I HAVE bought &startq;Hogarth's Analy&s;is:&endq; it is really
entertaining; and has, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, adju&s;ted my
notions with regard to beauty in general. For in|&s;tance,
were I to draw a &s;hield, I could give you
rea&s;ons from hence why the &s;hape was plea&s;ing or
di&s;agreeable. I would have you <HI>borrow</HI> and read
it.</P>
<P>GRANDISON I cannot think equal to Clari&s;&s;a;

author of it de&s;erves a bi&s;hopric.</P>

<HEAD>LXXVII. To the &s;ame, on the Death of Mr.
WHISTLER.</HEAD>
<OPENER>Dear Mr. Graves,
The Lea&s;owes,
<DATE>June 7, 1754.</DATE></OPENER>
<P>THE melancholy account of our dear friend
Whi&s;tler's death was conveyed to me, at the
&s;ame in&s;tant, by yours and by his brother's letter.
I have written to his brother this po&s;t; though I
am very ill able to write upon the &s;ubject, and would
willingly have waved it longer, but for decency.
The triumvirate, which was the greate&s;t happine&s;s
and the greate&s;t pride of my life, is broken! The
fabric of an ingenuous and di&s;intere&s;ted friend&s;hip
has lo&s;t a noble column! yet it may, and <HI>will,</HI> I
tru&s;t, endure till one of us be laid as low. In truth,
one can &s;o little &s;atisfy one's &s;elf with what we &s;ay
upon &s;uch &s;ad occa&s;ions, that I made three or four
e&s;&s;ays before I could <HI>endure</HI> what I had written to his
brother.&mdash;Be &s;o good as excu&s;e me to him as well
as you can, and e&s;tabli&s;h me in the good opinion
of him and Mr. Walker.</P>
<P>POOR Mr. Whi&s;tler! how do all our little &s;trifes
and bickerments appear to us at this time! yet we
may with comfort reflect, that they were not of a
<HI>&s;ort</HI> that touched the <HI>vitals</HI> of our friend&s;hip; and I
may &s;ay, that we fondly loved and e&s;teemed each
<PB N="231" REF="240">
other, of nece&s;&s;ity&mdash;&startq;Tales animas <HI>oportuit</HI> e&s;&s;e con|cordes.&endq;
Poor Mr. Whi&s;tler! not a &s;ingle acquaint|ance
have I made, not a &s;ingle picture or curio&s;ity
have I purcha&s;ed, not a &s;ingle embelli&s;hment have I
given to my place, &s;ince he was la&s;t here, but I have
had his approbation and his amu&s;ement in my eye.
I will a&s;&s;uredly in&s;cribe my larger urn to his memo|ry;
nor &s;hall I pa&s;s it without a plea&s;ing melancho|ly
during the remainder of my days. We have each
of us received a plea&s;ure from <HI>his</HI> conver&s;ation, which
no other conver&s;ation can afford us at our pre&s;ent
time of life.</P>
<P>ADIEU! my dear friend! may our remembrance
of the per&s;on we have lo&s;t be the &s;trong and ever|la&s;ting
cement of our affection! A&s;&s;ure Mr. John
Whi&s;tler of the regard I have for him, upon his <HI>own</HI>
account, as well as his brother's. Write to me;
directly if you have opportunity. Whether you have

<HEAD>LXXVIII. To the &s;ame.</HEAD>
<OPENER>Dear Mr. Graves,
The Lea&s;owes,
<DATE>July 15, 1754.</DATE></OPENER>
<P>THE <HI>particulars</HI> relating to our poor friend's de|parture
occa&s;ioned me much concern, and in|deed
&s;ome tears: yet as <HI>tho&s;e</HI> particulars are what
one covets to hear, and the melancholy which they
produce is never unmixed with plea&s;ure, I think
my&s;elf much obliged to you for the care you took
to convey them. It is po&s;&s;ible, the letters I wrote
to you and Mr. J. Whi&s;tler might appear too tender
from a <HI>mere</HI> friend of the decea&s;ed; but there is a
&s;ympathy betwixt friends, which is not always found
among&s;t relations; nor does <HI>kindred</HI> imply <HI>friend&s;hip</HI>
a whit more than <HI>friend&s;hip</HI> does <HI>kindred.</HI> It is not
many weeks ago, that I had a bill filed again&s;t me
in Chancery by young D&mdash;, the only near rela|tion
I have by the mother's &s;ide, and the next in
lineal &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to my &s;hare of the Peun's e&s;tate.&mdash;
Do not let this &s;urprize you&mdash;I believe the affair
will be accommodated.&mdash;He only wanted to procure
a divi&s;ion of the Harborough e&s;tate at a large ex|pence,
which might be better adju&s;ted without <HI>any;</HI>
in other words, to run his head again&s;t a &s;tone-wall,
that he might have a chance of cau&s;ing it to tumble
upon <HI>me.</HI> Would you con&s;ent that I &s;hould &s;uffer
him to have the man&s;ion-hou&s;e at Harborough thrown
into his lot? Were I &s;o to do, I could make it ad|vantageous
<PB N="233" REF="242">
to my&s;elf, and the di&s;pute were at an
end; but I have a kind of romantic veneration for
that <HI>place</HI> and <HI>family;</HI> which, if you remember, I
have expre&s;&s;ed in one of my be&s;t elegies<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Elegy xv.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>PRAY what will become of our letters to Mr.
Whi&s;tler? As I am not con&s;cious of any thing di&s;|honourable
in mine (and I am <HI>&s;ure</HI> I may &s;ay the
&s;ame of yours), methinks I could with that they
might not be de&s;troyed. It is from a few letters
of my own or others alone, accidentally pre&s;erved,
that I am able to recollect what I have been doing
&s;ince I was born.</P>
<P>I MET, when I was la&s;t at Barrels, a &s;urgeon of
Bath, who&s;e name, I think, was Cleland. He knew
your name and place; but, I find, was not personal|ly
acquainted with you.&mdash;I am glad enough to hear
that your place gets into vogue. It is, I think,
what you &s;hould <HI>chu&s;e,</HI> upon all accounts. Let the
beauty of the place guide them to the merits of its
<HI>owner.</HI> I have often thought, my&s;elf, that were a
per&s;on to live at The Lea&s;owes, of more merit than
my&s;elf, and a few degrees more worldly prudence,
he could &s;carce want opportunities to procure his
own advancement. My rural embelli&s;hments are per|haps
more con&s;iderable than yours; but then the
vicinity of Bath might occa&s;ion you a greater conflux.&mdash;
Your unexpen&s;ive illuminations plea&s;e me highly.
<PB N="234" REF="243">
I have purpo&s;ed the&s;e many years to purcha&s;e a &s;et
of tin-lamps, of about four-pence a-piece, to &s;tick
again&s;t trees, and to u&s;e upon occa&s;ion in my cop|pice;
or rather in my grove, where &s;ome of the
water-falls would not fail to &s;hew delightfully.</P>
<P>You a&s;ked me about Jago's preferment. The liv|ing
<HI>last given</HI> him by the Bi&s;hop of Worce&s;ter is,
I believe, near an hundred pounds a year. With
this, he has Harbury, of about fifty; and Che&s;ler|ton,
a &s;ort of chapel of ea&s;e, about forty; in the
<HI>whole,</HI> therefore, about a hundred and ninety: but
then he is obliged to keep a curate; and what I think
yet wor&s;e is, that he cannot make it <HI>convenient</HI> to
<HI>live</HI> at his new &s;ituation, which is a pretty one.</P>
<P>I HAVE had &s;ome vi&s;itants this &s;ea&s;on; indeed
as many, and as con&s;iderable, as &s;uch a &s;ort of &s;ea|&s;on
could afford me. A Scotch peer called upon
me in his way through Birmingham: his title was
D&mdash;. He &s;eemed to have a very clear head, a very
polite and ea&s;y manner, and all the refinement of
true ta&s;te, <HI>without</HI> the warmth or appetite.&mdash;I could
not help thinking him, on many accounts, cha|racteri&s;tic
of the Scotti&s;h nation.</P>
<P>WOULD to God I could &s;ee you and Mrs. Graves
here this &s;ummer! I have the &s;ame wi&s;h it may be
<PB N="235" REF="244">
<HI>my</HI> lot to vi&s;it <HI>you</HI> next autumn. Be a&s;&s;ured, I <HI>purpo&s;e</HI>
it.</P>
<P>I EXPECT Dod&s;ley every week. He will, I am
convinced, be for publi&s;hing his Mi&s;cellany next win|ter.
Would Mr. W&mdash;, think you, agree, that you
and I &s;hould be allowed to publi&s;h &s;uch of poor Mr.
Whi&s;tler's papers there, as we judged were mo&s;t like|ly
to do credit to his memory?</P>
<P>ADIEU! dear Mr. Graves. Let us reconcile our
affections to the ordinary events of life; and let us
adopt my friend Jago into our &s;econd triumvirate.
I am, however, always, with <HI>peculiar</HI> attachment,

<HEAD>LXXIX. To the &s;ame, on hearing that his Letters to
Mr. WHISTLER were de&s;troyed.</HEAD>
<OPENER>Dear Mr. Graves,
The Lea&s;owes,
<DATE>Oct. 23, 1754.</DATE></OPENER>
<P>IT is certainly &s;ome argument of a <HI>peculiarity</HI> in
the e&s;teem I bear you, that I feel a readine&s;s to
acquaint you with <HI>more</HI> of my foibles than I care to
tru&s;t with any other per&s;on. I believe nothing &s;hews
us more plainly either the different <HI>degrees</HI> or <HI>kinds</HI>
of regard that we entertain for our &s;everal friends
(I may al&s;o add the <HI>difference</HI> of their <HI>characters</HI>),
than the ordinary &s;tyle and tenor of the letters we
addre&s;s to them.</P>
<P>I CONFESS to <HI>you,</HI> that I am con&s;iderably mortified
by Mr. John W&mdash;'s conduct in regard to my letters
to his brother; and, rather than they &s;hould have
been &s;o unnece&s;&s;arily de&s;troyed, would have given
more money than it is allowable for me to mention
with <HI>decency.</HI> I look upon my letters as &s;ome of <HI>my</HI>
chef-d'oeuvres; and, could I be &s;uppo&s;ed to have
the lea&s;t preten&s;ions to propriety of &s;tyle or &s;enti|ment,
<PB N="237" REF="246">
I &s;hould imagine it mu&s;t appear, principally,
in my letters to his brother, and one or two more
friends. I con&s;idered them as the records of a <HI>friend|&s;hip</HI>
that will be always <HI>dear</HI> to me, and as the
<HI>hi&s;tory</HI> of my <HI>mind</HI> for the&s;e twenty years la&s;t pa&s;t.
The amu&s;ement I &s;hould have found in the peru&s;al
of them would have been altogether innocent; and
I would gladly have pre&s;erved them, if it were only
to explain tho&s;e which I &s;hall pre&s;erve of his bro|ther's.
Why he &s;hould allow either <HI>me</HI> or <HI>them</HI> &s;o
very little weight as not to <HI>con&s;ult</HI> me with regard
to them, I can by no means conceive. I &s;uppo&s;e
it is not <HI>un-cu&s;tomary</HI> to return them to the &s;urviving
friend. I had no an&s;wer to the letter which I wrote
Mr. J. W&mdash;. I received a ring from him; but as
I thought it an inadequate memorial of the friend|&s;hip
which his brother had for me, I gave it to my
&s;ervant the moment I received it; at the &s;ame time
I have a neat &s;tandi&s;h, on which I cau&s;ed the lines
Mr. W&mdash;left with it to be in&s;cribed, and which
appears to me a much more agreeable remembrancer.</P>
<P>I HAVE read your new production with plea&s;ure;
and as this letter begins with a confe&s;&s;ion of foibles,
I will own, that through mere lazine&s;s I have &s;ent you
back your copy in which I have made &s;ome era&s;e|ments,
in&s;tead of giving you my rea&s;ons on which
tho&s;e era&s;ements were founded. Truth is, it &s;eems
to me to want mighty few variations from what is
<PB N="238" REF="247">
now the pre&s;ent text; and that, upon one more pe|ru&s;al,
you will be able to give it as much perfection
as you mean it to have. And yet, did I &s;uppo&s;e
you would in&s;ert it in Dod&s;ley's Collection, as I &s;ee
no rea&s;on you have to the contrary, I would take
any pains about it that you &s;hould de&s;ire me. I
mu&s;t beg another copy, at your lei&s;ure.</P>
<P>I SHOULD like the in&s;cription you mention upon
a real &s;tone-urn, which you purcha&s;e very rea&s;ona|ble
at Bath: but you mu&s;t not ri&s;que it upon the va&s;e
you mention, on any account whatever.</P>
<P>Now I mention Bath, I mu&s;t acquaint you, that I
have received intelligence from the younger Dod|fley,
that his brother is now there, and that none of
the papers I &s;ent him are yet <HI>&s;ent to pre&s;s;</HI> that he
expects his brother home about the fourth or fifth
of November, when he proceeds with his publication.
Po&s;&s;ibly you may go to Bath whil&s;t he is there, and,
if &s;o, may chu&s;e to have an interview.</P>
<P>I SHALL &s;end two or three little pieces of my
own, in hopes that you will adju&s;t the reading, and
return them as &s;oon as you conveniently can. All
I can &s;end to-night is this &startq;Ode to Memory.&endq; I
&s;hall in the la&s;t place de&s;ire your opinion as to the
manner of <HI>placing</HI> what is &s;ent. The fir&s;t pages of

<PB N="239" REF="248">
propo&s;e ours for the la&s;t; but as to the <HI>order,</HI> it will

<P>WERE I to pronounce my &s;entence upon the
long &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of our corre&s;pondence, I &s;hould
impute the blame of it, in almo&s;t <HI>equal</HI> mea&s;ure, to
<HI>your&s;elf</HI> and to <HI>me.</HI> To <HI>you,</HI> for an omi&s;&s;ion of the

for waiting in expectation of it, and for neglecting
to do <HI>ju&s;tice</HI> to the &s;entiments of my heart on the
occa&s;ion of your late preferment. Great were the
hopes I had indeed conceived, that your increa&s;e of
revenue had been accompanied with a place of re|&s;idence
which was more <HI>to your mind</HI> than that where
you at pre&s;ent abide; but I do not find by any ac|counts
that you purpo&s;e to leave Harbury: for which,
no doubt, you have rea&s;ons which I do not yet pe|netrate,
but which may demand my a&s;&s;ent the mo|ment
you di&s;cover them. I have but little to &s;ay
of the life I have led &s;ince you received &s;ome ac|count
<PB N="240" REF="249">
of me from Mr. Hylton in London. The Win|ter,
or at lea&s;t its <HI>mini&s;ters,</HI> continued to tyrannize
during the <HI>minority</HI> of Spring; and the Spring has
alike been &s;low in giving up the reins to Summer.
Of con&s;equence, I &s;eem in a &s;ort of middle &s;tate,
betwixt a dull half-animated grub and an in&s;ignifi|cant
loco-motive fly. Neither in the <HI>one</HI> &s;tate or
<HI>other</HI> am I of the lea&s;t importance; but, from the
advances which I have <HI>already</HI> made, you are <HI>some|what</HI>
the more likely to find me in your garden.
About a fortnight ago I received a line or two from
our intimate acquaintance and &s;chool-fellow Mr. Hall.
It was brought me by Sir Edward Boughton's gar|dener;
a fellow of good ta&s;te, to whom Mr. Hall
de&s;ired I would cau&s;e The Lea&s;owes to be &s;hewn.
I find you have delighted Mrs. Hall by &s;ome altera|tions
which you propo&s;e for their environs, and which
they thoroughly re&s;olve to put in execution. When
I come over into Warwick&s;hire, as I hope to do
&s;oon, I &s;hall be very glad to make them a vi&s;it in
your company. My &s;pirits, though far from good,
are better in the main than they were in winter,
and on &s;ome peculiar days are rai&s;ed as high as to
<HI>alacrity; very</HI> &s;eldom higher, &s;eldom &s;o high.</P>
<P>You mu&s;t (from hence at lea&s;t) take matters in
the order or rather <HI>di&s;order</HI> in which they occur:
Mr. Miller I &s;aw on Wedne&s;day la&s;t in Lady Lyt|telton's
coach, who &s;topped two minutes at my gate
<PB N="241" REF="250">
on her return from London. I enquired concerning
you; but could gather no intelligence.&mdash;Mr. Hylton,
who is now in Warwick&s;hire (if he have not &s;trolled
to London), has been with me &s;everal months this
&s;ummer. He is adding a room or two to his place,
which lies very near me; and purpo&s;es to re&s;ide
there as &s;oon as it is fini&s;hed. The &s;ituation is not
void of beauties; but, if you will pardon the vanity,
mu&s;t veil its bonnet to mine. I have heard of plant|ing
hollies, pyracanthas, and other berry-bearing
greens, to attract tho&s;e Blackbirds which you have
&s;o effectually celebrated: it &s;hall be <HI>my</HI> ambition to
plant good neighbours; and, what with Lord Dudley
and his exotics, Mr. Hylton with his fo&s;&s;ils, and my|&s;elf
with my <HI>ferme orn&eacute;e,</HI> is there not &s;ome room to ex|pect
that we may attract the ta&s;ters this way? but
fir&s;t we mu&s;t take &s;ome care to <HI>adverti&s;e</HI> them where
their trea&s;ures lie.&mdash;Another day is pa&s;&s;ed, and Mr.
Miller, &amp;c. has again been with me, and waked me
out of a &s;ound &s;leep to breakfa&s;t.&mdash;He mentions with
what reluctance he <HI>left</HI> a &s;urveyor at Radway, em|ployed
in taking plans of the field of battle near
Edge-hill. This he purpo&s;es to enrich with a number
of anecdotes, gleaned from his neighbourhood; which
mu&s;t probably render it extremely entertaining: and
&s;urely Edge-hill fight was never more unfortunate to
the nation, than it was lucky for Mr. Miller! He
prints, together with this plan, another &s;heet of Rad|way
Ca&s;tle. I approve his de&s;ign. He will, by this
<PB N="242" REF="251">
means, turn every bank and hillock of his e&s;tate there,
if not into <HI>cla&s;&s;ical,</HI> at lea&s;t into <HI>hi&s;torical</HI> ground.</P>
<P>I HAVE done mighty little about my grounds &s;ince
la&s;t winter. As indolence has on <HI>many</HI> occa&s;ions con|tributed
to <HI>impair</HI> my finances, it is bu&s;t ju&s;t that it
&s;hould &s;ometimes contribute to <HI>re&s;tore</HI> them. Yet I
am not quite de&s;titute of &s;omething new for your
amu&s;ement.</P>
<P>OF late I have neither <HI>read</HI> nor <HI>written</HI> a &s;yllable.
What pleated me la&s;t was &startq;Hogarth's Analy&s;is.&endq; I
expect Dod&s;ley down every week; and as he will
&s;pend a few days with me, I could wi&s;h you were to
meet him. His genius is truly poetical, and his &s;en|timents
altogether liberal and ingenuous.</P>
<P>I AM, at pre&s;ent, a &s;urveyor of roads; employed in
repairing my lane to the turnpike. How glad &s;hould
I be to meet you, End to &s;hew you its <HI>beauties!</HI> to &s;hew

well as his <HI>performances</HI> at Lappa!&mdash;how glad &s;hould I
be to &s;ee you! yea, I would hardly fail to return with
you to Harbury; were you to add this one obligation.
I left Mr. Miller in doubt whether he would not &s;ee me
at Radway &s;ome time next week. Evil and caprici|ous
health (the particulars of which would make a de|tail
of no importance) de&s;troys all my punctuality,

firm to &s;upport the fabric of friend&s;hip, which has lo&s;t

<P>SHALL I beg a line from you, as &s;oon as may be?&mdash;
I do, mo&s;t earne&s;tly.</P>
<P>I AM given to under&s;tand that I may expect a
vi&s;it this &s;ummer from the Bi&s;hop of Worce&s;ter;
from Lord Ward, Lord Coventry, and Lord Guern|&s;ey.&mdash;It
may be &s;o; but honours of <HI>this &s;ort,</HI> which
would formerly have affected me, perhaps <HI>too</HI> deeply,
have now lo&s;t much of their wonted poignancy. Can
<HI>&s;uch</HI> per&s;ons bear to &s;ee the &s;cenes <HI>riant,</HI> and to find
the <HI>owner</HI> gloomy? Let <HI>them,</HI> as they are <HI>able,</HI> make
<PB N="244" REF="253">
my circum&s;tances more affluent; and they &s;hall find
the <HI>relection</HI> in <HI>my</HI> face and in <HI>their</HI> reception; but,
as this will never be, it is no compliment to declare,
that an hour or two's interview with you or Mr.
Graves outweighs the arrival of the whole Briti&s;h
Peerage.</P>
<P>SOMETHING el&s;e I have to &s;ay. Young Pixell la&s;t
winter told me, that the organi&s;t of Worce&s;ter had
&s;et your Ode (The Blackbirds) to mu&s;ic; that he
<HI>liked</HI> the mu&s;ick; and that he would &s;ing it next
evening at the Birmingham concert. I have not
heard him mention it <HI>&s;ince,</HI> and I <HI>forgot</HI> to enquire;
but, if you happen to have the notes, I &s;hould be
glad if you would inclo&s;e them for me.</P>
<P>I HAVE been of late much bent upon the encrea&s;e
of <HI>horns</HI> in this neighbourhood.&mdash;Do not interpret
me <HI>perver&s;ely;</HI> I mean French-horns only. My Lord
Dudley has had a per&s;on to teach two of his &s;er|vants&mdash;
nothing&mdash;at my in&s;tigation; but your old ac|quaintance
Maurice, <HI>who lives at the corner of my cop|pice,</HI>

ear. I have borrowed a horn for him. Adieu!</P>

<HEAD>LXXXII. To Mr. JAGO, on their Contribution to
DODSLEY'S Mi&s;cellanies.</HEAD>
<OPENER>Dear Mr. Jago,
The Lea&s;owes,
<DATE>Jan. 22, 1755.</DATE></OPENER>
<P>I AM &s;ure you mu&s;t be puzzled how to account
for my &s;ilence, after the honour you have done
me by your ver&s;es, and the reque&s;t you made that
I would <HI>write.</HI>&mdash;I am al&s;o as much at a lo&s;s how to
give a proper weight to my apology. To &s;ay I have
been ill, would perhaps imply too much; when I
would only allude to that &s;tate of heavine&s;e and de|jection
which is &s;o frequently my lot at this time of
the year; and which renders me both <HI>aver&s;e</HI> to wri|ting,
and utterly di&s;&s;atisfied with every thing that I
<HI>do</HI> write.</P>
<P>IF at any time my head grew a little le&s;s confu&s;ed
than ordinary, I was obliged to devote my attention
to the affair in which I had &s;o <HI>fooli&s;hly</HI> involved my|&s;elf
with Dod&s;ley. You are unable to conceive what
vexation it has given me: I could not endure, to
<HI>di&s;appoint</HI> him: of con&s;tquence, it has been my lot
to &s;tudy the delicacies of <HI>poetry</HI> when my brain was
not &s;ufficient to indite a piece of common pro&s;e; but
as the <HI>mou&s;e</HI> (by which I mean my <HI>own</HI> performances)
will &s;o &s;oon make its ridiculous appearance, it were
totally impolitic in me to expatiate on the labours
of the <HI>mountain.</HI>&mdash;The fir&s;t letter I received from you
<PB N="248" REF="257">
left me greatly di&s;&s;atisfied. I was then to &s;end D&mdash;
my <HI>final</HI> in&s;tructions in a po&s;t or two.&mdash;You took lit|tle
notice of any query I made; and intimated a dis|approbation,
which agreed <HI>too well</HI> with my own
internal &s;entiments.&mdash;I knew not but you were <HI>angry</HI>
at the <HI>liberties</HI> I had taken; though I could have
&s;uppre&s;&s;ed any &s;ingle paper which I had then convey|ed
to London.&mdash;Little did I <HI>then</HI> imagine that it was
in my power to have protracted the affair till <HI>now.</HI>
Had that been the ca&s;e, I &s;hould have troubled you
with repeated emba&s;&s;ies; for I abhor the tediou&s;ne&s;s
of the po&s;t, and my &s;ervants do little at this time
of the year that is of more importance than their
ma&s;ter's poetry.</P>
<P>YOUR next letter convinced me that you had
taken no offence; and &s;o far I was happy: but then
I wanted to have your Goldfinches as correct as
your Blackbirds; there were <HI>&s;ome</HI> things I wi&s;hed
you to alter; and others in regard to which I was
de&s;irous to &s;peak my <HI>&s;entiments.</HI> Add to this, my
own <HI>ver&s;es,</HI> with which I was infinitely <HI>more</HI> di&s;&s;atis|fied.
Why then did I not write?&mdash;The true rea&s;on
was, that I was pre&s;&s;ed by D&mdash;to &s;end conclu&s;ions
every po&s;t; and though I have had all this lei&s;ure
(as it <HI>happens</HI>) &s;ince you wrote, I never could <HI>depend</HI>
upon more than the &s;pace of a day or two. Be|&s;ides,
critici&s;ms in the way of letter are extremely
tedious and di&s;&s;atisfactory; in&s;omuch, that I am
<PB N="249" REF="258">
thoroughly determined never to print any thing for
the future, unle&s;s I have the company of my friends
when i &s;end to the pre&s;s. Hurried as I then was, I
&s;ent up your two copies, and what I propo&s;ed for him
of my own, with a kind of <HI>di&s;cretionary</HI> power to &s;e|lect
the be&s;t readings. How you would approve of
this mea&s;ure I knew not; but I had this to plead in
my behalf, that D&mdash;was a per&s;on of ta&s;te <HI>him&s;elf;</HI>
that he had, as I imagined, many learned friends to
a&s;&s;i&s;t him; that his <HI>intere&s;t</HI> was concerned in the per|fection
of his Mi&s;cellany; and that I &s;ubmitted my
own pieces to the &s;ame judgement.</P>
<P>AFTER all, I am but indifferently &s;atisfied with the
pre&s;ent &s;tate of the&s;e contributions. D&mdash;writes
ju&s;t &s;o much as he deems <HI>ncce&s;&s;ary</HI> in the way of
bu&s;ine&s;s, and pa&s;&s;es by a thou&s;and points in my letters,
which de&s;erve an an&s;wer. His la&s;t acquaints me,
that he has &s;pent a whole day in the arrangement
of what I have &s;ent him; and that he purpo&s;es to
&s;end me <HI>proof-&s;heets</HI> before the clo&s;e of this week,
de&s;iring I would &s;end them back by the return of
the po&s;t. Whether they arrive on Saturday or on
Monday, I can keep them till the Thur&s;day follow|ing.</P>
<P>AND this brings me, in the la&s;t place, to the main
purpo&s;e of this letter.&mdash;It is a reque&s;t on which I
lay great &s;tre&s;s; and which you mu&s;t not refu&s;e me
<PB N="250" REF="259">
upon almo&s;t any con&s;ideration.&mdash;I beg, in &s;hort, that
you would promi&s;e me the favour of your company
on Monday (or even Tue&s;day) next, if po&s;&s;ible; and
let us jointly fix the readings of <HI>your</HI> pieces, of my
<HI>even,</HI> and tho&s;e of our common <HI>friends.</HI>&mdash;You will
immediately comprehend the <HI>expediency of this; now,
in particular, that our names are to appear.</HI> Some
alterations I think <HI>nece&s;&s;ary</HI> in your Goldfinches, and
there are two or three &s;tanzas which I think you
might improve.&mdash;Neverthele&s;s, I will not pretend
that this journey is &s;o <HI>requi&s;ite</HI> upon your <HI>own</HI> ac|count
as <HI>mine;</HI> and will recommend it upon no other
footing than the plea&s;ure you will receive by the
obligation which you will confer.</P>
<P>I THOUGHT to have concluded here; but, as an
envelope is now become altogether nece&s;&s;ary, have
a temptation to proceed which I did not &s;ee before.</P>
<P>IT is now become Friday the twenty-fourth of
January. The packets I &s;end, and the reque&s;t that
I make upon &s;o <HI>little</HI> warning, will, at fir&s;t, a&s;toni&s;h
you.&mdash;Unfore&s;een interruptions would not &s;uffer me
to di&s;patch my courier &s;ooner.&mdash;What then remains,
but that I endeavour to adju&s;t this affair agreeably
to its <HI>pre&s;ent</HI> circum&s;tances?</P>
<P>You will readily conceive, from what you ob&s;erve
in my packers, how de&s;ireable your company is to
<PB N="250" REF="260">
me at this juncture. Suppo&s;ing it then in your <HI>power</HI>
to come over on Monday, Tue&s;day, or even Wed|ne&s;day,
I am inclined to believe you <HI>will.</HI> Sup|po&s;ing
it <HI>not</HI> &s;o, I can fore&s;ee you will not have lei|&s;ure
to &s;atisfy my queries by the return of the
bearer: and what I would <HI>next</HI> propo&s;e is, that you
would either &s;uffer me to &s;end again to you betwixt
this time and Thur&s;day next; or that you would
your&s;elf di&s;patch a purpo&s;e-me&s;&s;enger, and allow me
to pay for his journey.&mdash;In either of the&s;e <HI>latter</HI>
ca&s;es, I am &s;ure you &s;o well know the nature of my
pre&s;ent irre&s;olution, that you will endeavour to afford
me all the a&s;&s;i&s;tance you are able.</P>
<P>ADIEU! my dear friend! and depend upon my

<OPENER>Dear Mr. Jago,
The Lea&s;owes,
<DATE>Feb. 22 1755.</DATE></OPENER>
<P>I RECEIVED a letter from Dod&s;ley, dated the
fifteenth of February; informing me that you
were then in town, had been with him, and left your
<PB N="252" REF="261">
directions whither he might &s;end you a &s;et of Mi&s;|cellanies.</P>
<P>FEBRUARY the twentieth, and not <HI>before,</HI> arrived
young H&mdash;with your letter; very obligingly in|tended
to give me previous notice of your journey;
but which, by the iniquity of chance, tended only
to acquaint me with an opportunity which I had <HI>lo&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>THERE is nothing could have been &s;o fortunate
as your journey to London, had Mr. H&mdash;thought
proper to bring your letter in due time.&mdash;What ex|cu&s;e
he made for his neglect, or whether he made
any, I have really forgot. This I know, that the
whole affair has been unlucky. There has been
abundant time for consultation, and a perfect &s;eries
of opportunities of which we have not been &s;uffered
to avail our&s;elves.&mdash;It is now three weeks or a month
&s;ince I corrected the proof-&s;heets; was &s;o hurried in
the doing of it that I &s;carce knew what I wrote;
and yet, in &s;pite of all this hurry, the book is hither|to
unpubli&s;hed. <HI>Now,</HI> indeed, it mu&s;t be much too
late for alterations, as D&mdash;has given me &s;ome room
to expect a book this very day&mdash;I know but little
what he has done in con&s;equence of that di&s;cretiona|ry
power with which I, through ha&s;te, was obliged
to intru&s;t him: but in what I have done <HI>my&s;elf,</HI> you
may expect to find all the effects of <HI>dulne&s;s precipi|tated.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="253" REF="262">
IT is now the twenty-third of February, and I
have received no fre&s;h account of our friend Dod|&s;ley's
proceedings; nor am I able to <HI>trace</HI> them, as
I expected, in the news-papers.</P>
<P>As to your &s;hare of this Mi&s;cellany, you can have
no cau&s;e to be di&s;latisfied.&mdash;After what manner he
has thought proper to print Lady L&mdash;'s ver&s;es, I am
a good deal uncertain; but I apprehend he has not
followed her own readings very preci&s;ely, and that
the blame thereof is to be thrown upon me.&mdash;I am
concerned for the memory of my poor friend Whi&s;t|ler,
and regret that his <HI>better</HI> pieces did not fall into
my hands. I think that Dod&s;ley, however, would
have done him greater ju&s;tice, had he in&s;erted his
tran&s;lation of &startq;Horace and Lydia.&endq; It is true, the
tran&s;lations of that Ode are out of number; but <HI>his,</HI>
if I mi&s;take not, had many beauties of its own.&mdash;I
do not know whether I ever hinted to you, that <HI>his</HI>
genius and that of Ovid were apparently congenial.&mdash;Had
he cultivated his with equal care, perhaps
the &s;imilitude had been as obvious as that of your
twin-daughters.&mdash;Mr. Graves has one &s;mall well|poli&s;hed
gem in this collection; his ver&s;es upon Me|dals.&mdash;
His little conjugal Love-&s;ong is al&s;o natural
and ea&s;y.&mdash;I <HI>told</HI> you what I lea&s;t di&s;liked of my <HI>own</HI>
puerilities.&mdash;If the printing of my Rural In&s;criptions
be <HI>invidious,</HI> it was altogether owing to the in&s;tiga|tion
<PB N="254" REF="263">
of Sir G&mdash;L&mdash;. There are four or five little
matters, which, if he have printed with my name,
incorrect as they are, I &s;hall be utterly di&s;con&s;olate;
at lea&s;t, till I get &s;ight of a &s;ucceeding impre&s;&s;ion.&mdash;For
though I am not much &s;olicitous about a poetical
reputation (and indeed it is of little importance to &s;o
<HI>dome&s;tic</HI> an animal as my&s;elf), yet I could ill endure
to pa&s;s for an affected, powerle&s;s <HI>pretender.</HI></P>
<P>AND now no more upon the &s;ubje&s;t.&mdash;I have no|thing
to add that can the lea&s;t amu&s;e you.&mdash;You,
who have been conver&s;ant with all the bu&s;y and the

make a letter entertaining.&mdash;Indeed you never <HI>did.</HI>&mdash;I
&s;hall be glad, however, to receive a <HI>long</HI> one,

<P>I HAVE pa&s;&s;ed a very dull and unamu&s;ive winter;

<P>I HAVE &s;o long expected the favour of a few
lines from you, that I begin at la&s;t to que&s;tion
whether you received the letter I &s;ent you. It was
inclo&s;ed in one to Mr. M&mdash;, whom I reque&s;ted to
further it with all convenient expedition. I am nei|ther

indeed, if I <HI>were,</HI> could I endure the thoughts of
tran&s;cribing them. The chief intention of it, how|ever,
was to acquaint you of Mr. H&mdash;'s unhappy
delay in the delivery of that letter with which you
favoured me from Radway.</P>
<P>WHAT confirms me in a &s;u&s;picion that my la&s;t let|ter
mi&s;carried is, that Mr. Wren lately acquainted
me of your being at Wroxall upon bu&s;ine&s;s, and of
your making &s;ome &s;light mention of Mr. Dod&s;ley's
publication, without intimating that you di&s;covered
any de&s;ign you had of writing to me. This is mere
preamble and &s;tuff: implying nothing more than
the de&s;ire I have to <HI>hear</HI> from you, when it ought
al&s;o to expre&s;s how impatiently I long to <HI>&s;ee</HI> you.
Worldly concerns and my winterly &s;tate of health
have detained me at home for the&s;e many months
pa&s;t: worldly concerns may have confined you like|wi&s;e;
but as your health and &s;pirits are univer&s;ally
<PB N="256" REF="265">
better than mine, and as you have much le&s;s di&s;like
to travelling than my&s;elf, I would hope that my ab|&s;ence
from Harbury will never cau&s;e you to <HI>neglect</HI>
any <HI>opportunity</HI> of coming hither. For my own part,
I have been meditating upon a vi&s;it to you all this
winter; and do, at this time, re&s;olve mo&s;t &s;trenuou&s;ly
to perform it before June. But the many &s;uch
&s;chemes of plea&s;ure in which I have been di&s;appoint|ed
are a &s;ort of check upon my expre&s;&s;ions, and
make me promi&s;e with <HI>fear.</HI> As to Dod&s;ley's per|formance,
which you mu&s;t have received before this
time, I will make no ob&s;ervations till I have the
plea&s;ure of &s;eeing you: and yet there are many points
I would di&s;cu&s;s, and many accounts I want to give
you. So many indeed, that they would furni&s;h out
perhaps a &s;uperficial drawling letter; but would
&s;erve infinitely better for conver&s;ation, with the book
before us. The volume, I am told, is well received
in town; though political intellgience mu&s;t engro&s;s
much of its pre&s;ent attention.</P>
<P>MR. HYLTON is in my neighbourhood, and upon

and that, not merely as it will afford me great plea|&s;ure,
but as, at the &s;ame time, it will ea&s;e me of

<OPENER>Dear Mr. Graves,
The Lea&s;owes,
<DATE>April 4, 1755.</DATE></OPENER>
<P>YOU will be harra&s;&s;ed with my letters till you
condemn my exce&s;&s;ive lei&s;ure as loudly as I
have lamented that you &s;hould ever feel the <HI>want</HI> of
it. Nor is it a point &s;o ea&s;ily decided <HI>which</HI> of us
may be the greater <HI>&s;ufferer;</HI> you through my <HI>officiou&s;|ne&s;s,</HI>
or I by your long <HI>&s;ilence.</HI> Yet the partiality
which you have ever &s;hewn me will, I think, di&s;po&s;e
you to receive my letters more patiently than it is
in my power to &s;u&s;tain the lo&s;s of <HI>yours.</HI> After all,
I &s;hould not write at pre&s;ent, but that the Mi&s;cel|lanies
with which Dod&s;ley compliments us arrived
la&s;t week at The Lea&s;owes. I de&s;ire therefore you
would acquaint ice, whether the &s;ett that he means
for you &s;hould remain here till your arrival; or if
you chu&s;e that I &s;hould &s;end it by the Birmingham-&s;tage
to Bath. Having made this enquiry, I was
thinking to conclude; but cannot reconcile my&s;elf
to the <HI>novelty</HI> of &s;ending <HI>you</HI> three empty pages. The
Parliament will ri&s;e too &s;oon for the publication
of my &startq;Rural Elegance;&endq; and having performed
my promi&s;e to Dod&s;ley, I think no more about &s;uch
<HI>laurels</HI> as the <HI>public</HI> can be&s;tow upon me, but am
giving all my attention to &s;uch as I can purcha&s;e
of my nur&s;ery-man. I wi&s;h, however, that the vo|lume
<PB N="261" REF="270">
may recompence Dod&s;ley for his trouble: I may
al&s;o add, for his ingenuity, and for his politene&s;s in
giving each of us a compleat &s;ett. They are elegant|ly
bound, and all as much alike as po&s;&s;tble.</P>
<P>THE pre&s;ent cri&s;is of &s;tate-affairs does not &s;eem to
favour his publication, as the attention of the pub|lic
mu&s;t lean greatly to that quarter. I &s;aw a letter
from Sir William M&mdash;(who corre&s;ponds with
Lady Luxborough), which placed the &s;truggles of the
mini&s;try in a clearer light than they had yet appear|ed
to me. It &s;eems that per&s;ons of all denomina|tions
are for carrying on the war with vigour; and
the King's application for a Vote of Credit was re|ceived
with general approbation. The zeal of the
Parliament was indeed &s;o remarkable on this occa|&s;ion,
that, in&s;tead of the 600, 000 <HI>l.</HI> at fir&s;t intended,
it was thought proper to propo&s;e a million. But
the &s;ervices were a&s;certained, and the Chancellor of
the Exchequer made accountable for the application
of it. The augmentation of the fleet with 20,000
&s;eamen; the rai&s;ing, 5000 marines on a plan of di|viding
them into &s;mall companies, which will render
them more u&s;eful both by &s;ea and land; the com|pletion
and reinforcement of the Iri&s;h regiments;
are the u&s;es to which this million is to be appro|priated.
Mr. Fox and his land-war-party &s;at mute,
whi&s;t Mr. Legge with great openne&s;s and per&s;picuity
explained the pre&s;ent &s;chemes; as they were calcu|lated
<PB N="262" REF="271">
to exert our whole &s;trength at &s;ea, and, if po&s;|&s;ible,
no where el&s;e. Mr. Dodington, who, it &s;eems,
has not &s;poke of many years, charmed every body.
His wit did not only entertain, but animate and af|fect
his hearers. &startq;<HI>It were better,</HI> he &s;aid, <HI>than lo&s;e
the dominion of the Ocean, that the Ocean &s;hould over|whelm
us: for what Briton could wi&s;h to leave a po&s;|terity
crawling upon this i&s;land, only to feel the ty|ranny,
and &s;well the victories, of France?&endq;</HI> It &s;eems,
F&mdash;, in his oppo&s;ition to the Duke of Newca&s;tle, is
&s;upported by the Duke of Cumberland, his army,
and the Scotch: that the mini&s;try (or the D. of N&mdash;'s
party) &s;eem not di&s;plea&s;ed with a pro&s;pect of uniting
with the Tories, who now hold the balance; and it
&s;eems the Tories, by Sir William's letter, are as
little di&s;plea&s;ed to unite with the Mini&s;try.</P>
<P>You will gue&s;s that good part of this political ac|count
is <HI>tran&s;cribed;</HI> and you will gue&s;s aright. I
had &s;ome thoughts that it might amu&s;e you, and had
no occa&s;ion to u&s;e other expre&s;&s;ions.&mdash;Let me now,
once more, return to the futile objects of my <HI>own</HI>
amu&s;ement. The impre&s;&s;ion upon this letter will
be taken from my new real. The motto that I have
pitched upon is, SVP$REST MEMORIA: though I yet
retain &s;ome hanke$ ing after the &s;ingle word PRAE|TERITIS.
Probably this, however, is not the la&s;t
&s;eal that I &s;hall cau&s;e this man to cut in &s;teel. The
altar is not yet fini&s;hed: ANTE OMNIA MVSAE; but
<PB N="263" REF="272">
it does not quite &s;atisfy me.&mdash;I will inclo&s;e the two

mu&s;t not think I build too much upon any compli|ment
which he there makes me.&mdash;It is true, I think

mu&s;t conjecture, when their piece is publi&s;hed, that

he has, unaccountably I think, &s;ent your books <HI>hither,</HI>

<OPENER>Dear Mr-Graves,
The Lea&s;owes,
<DATE>Mar. 7, 1757&punc;</DATE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE pa&s;&s;ed a very dull and unamu&s;ive win|ter
here&mdash;the wor&s;e, for being neither <HI>di&s;po&s;ed</HI> nor
<HI>qualified</HI> to keep up a corre&s;pondence with my friends:
with <HI>you,</HI> among the <HI>chief;</HI> and yet it is upon you
that I mu&s;t depend to make up my deficiencies with
Mr. Dod&s;ley.&mdash;The poor man has been afflicted with
the mo&s;t <HI>la&s;ting</HI> fit of the gout he ever underwent
before.&mdash;His patience, on the&s;e occa&s;ions, is inimita|ble.&mdash;
His excur&s;ion to the <HI>Regions of Terror and Pity</HI>
is not the only in&s;tance of his ability to compo&s;e ver&s;es
in the mid&s;t of pain. When he &s;ent me a copy of it,
<PB N="266" REF="275">
he let me know, that he had tran&s;mitted another to
yo$ by the &s;ame po&s;t: I &s;hould be glad to receive
your remarks upon it, ere I communicate my own. I
have, for &s;ome weeks pa&s;t, found my head &s;o terribly
confu&s;ed, that it has been with difficulty I could
<HI>think</HI> or <HI>expre&s;s</HI> my&s;elf on the mo&s;t &s;uperficial topic.
I hope, in a little time, to be able to examine it
more attentively than I can at pre&s;ent: yet, in the
mean while, mu&s;t acknowledge, that I think his &s;ub|ject
capable of furni&s;hing extraordinary beauties for
an Ode: and <HI>&s;uch,</HI> I think, he &s;hould <HI>call</HI> it; drop|ping
the narrative parts and the connexions as much
as po&s;&s;ible. I cannot wi&s;h him to print it without
very <HI>material</HI> alterations, and what would occa&s;ion
almo&s;t the &s;ame trouble as it would require to <HI>new|write</HI>
it. I do not mean this as a condemnation of
what he has already done, &s;o much as a proof of
my opinion how much he will be able to improve it.
<HI>After all,</HI> it will &s;carce affect me half &s;o much as
his Tragedy. He is &s;o <HI>hone&s;t</HI> a man, that the work
he has to give the world is much better than the
&s;pecimen: or, to borrow an idea from <HI>my &s;ituation,</HI>
the grain that he has to deliver will prove much bet|ter
than the &s;ample. It is with &s;hame I acknowledge
I have not yet &s;ent him his epilogue; and I feel the
greater comp$nction of mind upon this &s;core, as it
is po&s;&s;ible he may impute my neglect to Garrick's
refu&s;al of his play. This weighs nothing with you
or me; a thou&s;and motives may affect a Manager,
<PB N="267" REF="276">
that have little or nothing to do with the merit of
the performance; yet he may &s;o far thank Mr. Gar|rick,
that whatever his refu&s;al takes from the <HI>re|putation</HI>
of his Tragedy, it will, through Dod&s;ley's
indu&s;try, add apparently to its value. I have not
yet been able to &s;atisfy my&s;elf with every part of your
epilogue, and mu&s;t either omit &s;ending it at pre&s;ent,
or mu&s;t &s;end him an imperfect copy. If you write
to him, let me beg you to give the mo&s;t favourable
account you <HI>can</HI> of me.</P>
<P>SOMEBODY acquainted me (I think it was Mr.
Talbot) that your old friend Ballard had bequeath|ed
you his coins for a legacy. I was truly glad to
hear it; but have wondered &s;ince, that you never
once informed me of &s;o con&s;iderable an acqui&s;ition.</P>
<P>I REMEMBER a poem of yours, called&mdash;, upon

more to &s;ee. Be &s;o kind as to &s;end me a copy of

In particular, I remember that upon Enigmas,

without your previous con&s;ent. You know, I &s;up|po&s;e,
that Dod&s;ley's other Mi&s;cellanies do not ap|pear

<PB N="268" REF="277">
with his Ode, a few Elegies publi&s;hed by Mr.
Whitehead. They are, I think, worth your peru&s;al;
and de&s;igned by my worthy friend to excite my emu|lation.&mdash;
Alas! that I am &s;o ill able to de&s;erve the
encouragements which I receive from him!</P>
<P>My neighbour Ba&s;kerville, at the clo&s;e of this
month, publi&s;hes his fine edition of Virgil. It will,
for <HI>type</HI> and <HI>paper,</HI> be a perfect curio&s;ity. He follows
the Cambridge edition.</P>
<P>WHAT think you of their management in regard
to Mr. Byng? I cannot help thinking the King
&s;hould <HI>pardon</HI> him. The Court-martial, by acquit|ting
him of cowardice or di&s;affection, have left no
<HI>motive</HI> for his <HI>negligence,</HI> be&s;ide an <HI>error of his judge|ment:</HI>
for we <HI>cannot</HI> impute it to <HI>&s;upinene&s;s, indifference,</HI>
or <HI>inattention.</HI> And then to &s;entence a man for er|ror,
is to expect infallibility. That twelfth article

<P>WHAT remarks I had to make upon our friend
Dod&s;ley's Ode, I &s;ent him the la&s;t po&s;t.
I would gladly have occa&s;ioned them to pa&s;s by
Claverton; but, having delayed them &s;o long, I was
impatient to convince him that I had not <HI>wholly</HI> dis|regarded
his reque&s;t. They are indeed pretty co|pious:
and yet I have re&s;erved to my&s;elf the pri|vilege
of re-critici&s;ing when I &s;ee his altered copy.
I recommended to him the addition which you pro|po&s;ed,
and &s;ome others; and if he will but take the
pains that I have chalked out for him, I doubt not
that he will render it an excellent Ode, though he
may not find it a very <HI>popular</HI> one. I have al&s;o &s;ent
him a copy of our epilogue, not much different from
what you &s;aw; to the&s;e I added my little Ode on
Lady Luxborough's furni&s;hing her library, and Perry's
Ver&s;es upon the Malvern-waters. At the clo&s;e of
the&s;e la&s;t, there appears (with Perry's approbation), a
&s;hort addre&s;s to Dr. Wall of Worce&s;ter; a very eminent
phy&s;ician, and the great patron of this mineral, who
has promoted a &s;ub&s;cription in the county towards
<HI>building,</HI> near this well, for the accommodation of
&s;trangers.</P>
<P><PB N="270" REF="279">

in the re&s;t, and to return me the copy.</P>

&s;carce bear examination: nor do I think that you
rather wi&s;h to have <HI>found</HI> that &s;et of medals, than to
have them <HI>given</HI> you by a decea&s;ed friend. A&s;&s;ured|ly,
if we do not allow plea&s;ure to be <HI>predominant</HI> in
this kind of melancholy, we de&s;troy the foundation
of all tragic or elegiac writings; Melpomene has no

have taken with our friend Dod&s;ley's pen&s;ive Ode
have been employed to no purpo&s;e. But you want
not the&s;e pedantic flouri&s;hes, and are wholly of my

<P>MARTIN'S Magazine is, I believe, pretty ob&s;cure;

&s;pirits renders me but ill able to revi&s;e. I believe,
<PB N="272" REF="281">
I am, even now, the principal cau&s;e that his two
volumes remain yet unpubli&s;hed; nor can I expre&s;s
the pain it gives me, to be thus detrimental to his
intere&s;ts, and to delay the publication of &s;o much
better pieces than my own. I am al&s;o di&s;&s;atisfied
upon <HI>another &s;core:</HI> I mean, that I have been wanting
to my&s;elf, in not a&s;king the benefit of your advice;
which I have heretofore experienced to be at once
&s;o <HI>comfortable</HI> and &s;o <HI>advantageous;</HI> but although the
&s;cheme was projected in &s;ummer, the bu&s;ine&s;s of cor|rection
was (by <HI>me</HI> at lea&s;t) deferred till winter, and
then I had neither &s;pirits to <HI>correct</HI> or to <HI>corre&s;pond.</HI></P>
<P>I AM really as much obliged to you for the pains
which yon took on my behalf in London, as though
the <HI>&s;ubject</HI> of your enquiry were a thing of more <HI>im|portance</HI>
to me; but, indeed, you can hardly conceive
how indifferent I am now grown, not only as to ar|ticles
of <HI>that &s;ort,</HI> but to aught that regards external
&s;plendour.</P>
<P>I REALLY have not time to enter upon the merits
of inoculation; but am very &s;ure that Mrs. G&mdash;'s
danger was enough to influence <HI>your</HI> determination.
I am heartily glad to hear of her recovery; and
can but look upon the weeks which I purpo&s;e to pa&s;s
&s;ome time hereafter with you at Claverton, as the
mo&s;t agreeable of any that belong to the remainder
of my life. I am &s;en&s;ible, that if I <HI>coveted</HI> to <HI>&s;hine</HI>
<PB N="275" REF="282">
in poetry, I &s;hould lo&s;e no time in vi&s;iting public

limited, and I &s;hall vi&s;it <HI>you</HI> on the account of
<HI>friend&s;hip;</HI> that is (pa&s;t all doubt) on a much <HI>better principle.</HI></P>
<P>I HAVE <HI>long</HI> meant to write to you, and have ac|cordingly
given <HI>&s;ome</HI> an&s;wer to mo&s;t parts of your
la&s;t letter. Neverthele&s;s, the occa&s;ion of this pre|&s;ent
letter is quite of another kind,&mdash;A young painter
of my acquaintance is advi&s;ed to go to Bath; has a
recommendation to the Bi&s;hop of B&mdash;, who will in|troduce
him to the Duke of N&mdash;. And though I
cannot &s;o ea&s;ily bring him acquainted with nobles
or prime-mini&s;ters, I can give him directions to my
friend, who, in point of ta&s;te, is their &s;uperior. The
per&s;on then, who, I &s;uppo&s;e, will be the bearer of
this letter, has, by dint of mere ingenuity, ri&s;en to
a con&s;iderable eminence in fruit-pieces, &amp;c. He has
been employed by Lord Lyttelton, and is much ad|mired
at Oxford: for my own part, I believe you
will think he is in few re&s;pects inferior to, and has
(if I am not mi&s;taken) &s;ome advantages of, Stran|over;
but you will &s;ee his pieces. All I have to
&s;ay further on the occa&s;ion is, that he is a native of
our pari&s;h, and a particular friend of <HI>mine;</HI> and if
it were in your power to promote his intere&s;t at Bath,
you would not only highly gratify <HI>me,</HI> but at the

<HEAD>XCI. On the &s;ame.</HEAD>
<OPENER>Dear Mr. Graves,
The Lea&s;owes,
<DATE>May 30, 1758.</DATE></OPENER>
<P>I THANK God, I have recovered a tolerable de|gree
of health this &s;pring; though by no means
free from &s;o much heavine&s;s and la&s;&s;itude, as
renders
me aver&s;e to all activity both of body and mind. In
the cour&s;e of my di&s;order, &s;o long as I could bear
to
think of <HI>any</HI> &s;ublunary enjoyment, I remembered
my
friends, and of cour&s;e thought much of <HI>you;</HI>
but its
advances were &s;o precipitate, when I &s;ent for the
phy&s;icians, that I &s;oon received a <HI>wrench</HI> from
every
object of this world: and it was by &s;low degrees,
even after my recovery, that my mind took &s;o much
root again as appears nece&s;&s;ary for its immediate
&s;upport. I &s;uppo&s;e you have been informed that my
fever was in great mea&s;ure hypochondriacal; and
left my nerves &s;o extremely &s;en&s;ible, that, even
on
no very intere&s;ting &s;ubject, I could readily think my|&s;elf
into a vertigo: I had almo&s;t &s;aid an epilep&s;y;
for &s;urely I was oftentimes near it. It became, there|fore,
expedient for my recovery, to amu&s;e my&s;elf
with a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of the mo&s;t trivial objects I could
<PB N="275" REF="284">
find; and this kind of carele&s;&s;ne&s;s I have indulged
till it is grown into an habit. Even letters to my
friends are hardly con&s;i&s;tent with my rule of health;
yet I could be no longer &s;ilent with regard to <HI>you,</HI>
without feeling a &s;en&s;ation that would hurt me <HI>more.</HI>
This may fairly enough be termed the fir&s;t <HI>letter</HI> I
have wrote &s;ince my recovery; wherein if I &s;hould
tell you one half that I am inclined to do, relating to
this dreadful illne&s;s, what room &s;hould I then leave
to &s;peak on any other &s;ubject? I mu&s;t, therefore, tell
the&s;e things by word of mouth, or write them &s;ome
other time. The journies which my friends, and in|deed
phy&s;icians, propo&s;e for me, are what certainly
bid faire&s;t for the completion of my cure: yet there
are many, many things, which, however unfit for
the ta&s;k, I mu&s;t endeavour to adju&s;t before I can leave
home with any po&s;&s;ibility of enjoyment. Need I
mention any other than my cur&s;ed embarra&s;&s;ment
with D&mdash;; who, during my <HI>danger,</HI> was induced to
&s;top proceedings; but is now beginning law afre&s;h,
and, by the removal of tenants from <HI>his</HI> &s;hare of the
Harborough e&s;tate, has now wriggled him&s;elf into
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of almo&s;t one half of <HI>mine?</HI> However, I
am not without hopes of &s;eeing all terminated in a
little time; nor entirely without a pro&s;pect of &s;eeing
you at Claverton this &s;ummer. That you may think
this the more probable, I am pre&s;&s;ed by two young
gentlemen, whom I very much e&s;teem, to accompany
them on a visit to Mr. Bamfylde in Somer&s;et&s;hire.
<PB N="276" REF="285">
The&s;e two gentlemen are, Mr. Dean and Mr. Knight.
Perhaps you may have heard of Mr. Bamfylde, who
is very much at Bath; is there now with his lady, or
has left the place but lately; and who&s;e fortune,
per&s;on, figure, and accompli&s;hments, can hardly leave
him long unnoticed in any place where he re&s;ides.
Yet my vi&s;it to E&s;tercomb mu&s;t be of &s;econdary con|&s;equence
to me, whil&s;t you live by the road-&s;ide. I
am much obliged to you for your compliment on my
Poematia in Dod&s;ley's Mi&s;cellanies; which came very
&s;ea&s;onably, considering how I had been mortified by
the fir&s;t &s;ight of what was done. To &s;peak the truth,
there are many things appear there very contrary
to my intentions; but which I am more de&s;irous
may be attributed to the un&s;ea&s;onablene&s;s of my fe|ver,
than to my friend D&mdash;'s precipitation. My pur|po&s;e
was to acknowledge as <HI>mine,</HI> none of the pieces
which now follow the longer Ode to Lady Luxbo|rough.
Her name was actually era&s;ed; as al&s;o my
own at the clo&s;e of your Fable. The ver&s;es by Mrs.
Bennet to Mr. Richard&s;on were ab&s;olutely new to
me; where my name occurs again. All this is a|gain&s;t
me; as a thing in it&s;elf invidious to have one's
name recur &s;o often, and as my <HI>own lines contradict</HI>
the merit which my friends &s;o liberally allow me.&mdash;
The ver&s;es of mine in the &s;ixth volume (which was
printed before the fifth) were printed without my
knowledge; and when I &s;ent up an improved copy,
it arrived a good deal too late. As things happen,
<PB N="277" REF="286">
I am made to own &s;everal things of inferior merit
to tho&s;e which I <HI>do not</HI> own.&mdash;All this is again&s;t
me; but my thoughts are avocated from this edition,
and wholly fixed upon a future; wherein, I hope,
Dod&s;ley will be prevailed upon to omit &s;ome things
al&s;o from <HI>other</HI> hands which di&s;credit his collection:
and, to balance <HI>all my di&s;comforts</HI> on this head, the
world will know that I ant e&s;teemed by a per&s;on
whom I e&s;teem &s;o much as you.&mdash;I know not how
it happens, but the ta&s;te for humorous poetry does
not prevail at this time: yet I cannot agree with Mr.
J. Warton, that it is no poetry <HI>at all,</HI> any more than
that a good repre&s;entation of Dutch boors is not a
picture.&mdash;His brother, the Profe&s;&s;or, is to be here
with his pupil Lord Donnegal, &amp;c. this &s;ummer.&mdash;
Mr. Spence and Mr. Dod&s;ley will &s;tay a day or two
here this month in their way to Scotland; and Mr.
Home, the author of Douglas, &amp;c. called on me, and
we &s;pent an evening together at Admiral Smith's.
Thus my <HI>f$rme orn&eacute;e</HI> procures me interviews with per|&s;ons
whom it might otherwi&s;e be my <HI>wi&s;h</HI> rather
than my good-fortune to &s;ee. Would to God, it could
attract <HI>you,</HI> whom I more long to &s;ee than any one!
and let me tell you, there were con&s;iderable addi|tions
made to it la&s;t year: Dod&s;ley's pre&s;ent of Fau|nus;
a new Gothic-building, or rather a &s;kreen, which
co&s;t ten pounds; and the ruins of a Priory, which,
however, make a tenant's hou&s;e, that pays me tole|rable
poundage,&mdash;I am growing a little into <HI>your</HI>
<PB N="278" REF="287">
ta&s;te: why &s;hould not you advance farther into <HI>mine?</HI>
I mean, I have a love for medals, by means of &s;ome
that have been given me: yet do not think that I
&s;hall ever rival <HI>you</HI>&mdash;my object is only <HI>beauty,</HI> and
I love only tho&s;e of exqui&s;ite workman&s;hip; &s;o that
this is no more a rival&s;hip than that of two per&s;ons
who admire the &s;ex, but love different individuals;
a rival&s;hip, which, I tru&s;t, is more likely to cement
our friendship than di&s;unite us; which it is my <HI>con|viction</HI>
and my <HI>comfort</HI> no <HI>&s;ort</HI> of rival&s;hip will ever
do. I have hardly room to expre&s;s my good wi&s;hes
for long health and happine&s;s to Mrs. Graves and
your little family, and to &s;ub&s;cribe my&s;elf, my dear

<OPENER>Dear Mr. Graves,
<DATE>July 22, 1758.</DATE></OPENER>
<P>IT gives me great anxiety when I reflect how long
I have waited for the &s;atisfaction of a line from
you. I beg, if you are alive and well, you will let
me know &s;o by the next po&s;t.</P>
<P>MR. Dod&s;ley and Mr. Spence have been here and
&s;tayed a week with me. The former was in certain
hopes of &s;eeing you in town; but I do not find that
<PB N="279" REF="288">
he either &s;aw or heard from you, which <HI>adds</HI> to my
anxiety.</P>
<P>I HAVE &s;een few whom I liked &s;o much, upon &s;o
little acquaintance, as Mr. Spence; extremely polite,
friendly, chearful, and mater of an infinite fund of
&s;ubjects for agreeable conver&s;ation. Had my affairs
permitted me, they had certainly drawn me with
them into Scotland; whither they are gone, for about
a month, upon a journey of curio&s;ity.</P>
<P>I BELIEVE it will give you plea&s;ure to hear that
my law-&s;uit with D&mdash;is accommodated, by the
generous interpo&s;ition of my Lord Stamford; con|cerning
who&s;e benevolence and magnanimity it is
impo&s;&s;ible for me to &s;peak in the terms which they
de&s;erve. It is ended, I hope, not very <HI>di&s;advantage|ously</HI>
for me; apparently with <HI>one</HI> advantage, of being
intirely exculpated in the opinion of all mankind.
The common method (as M. Bruyere ob&s;erves) is to
condemn <HI>both</HI> on the&s;e occa&s;ions. This &s;uits peo|ple's
indolence, and favours their impartiality. And
though the equitablene&s;s of my whole conduct in this
affair was &s;elf-evident to all that were near me, yet
I found many that were inclined to blame us <HI>both,</HI>
and <HI>&s;ome</HI> that I could never convince till <HI>now</HI> that
the fault was not <HI>wholly</HI> mine.</P>
<P><PB N="280" REF="289">
YOUR &startq;Pepper-box and Salt-&s;eller&endq; are in one

&s;ome friend among&s;t the writers of the Monthly Re|view;
for I have not only e&s;caped a flogging, but
am treated with great civility.</P>
<P>I NEVER know how to leave off when I begin

<HEAD>XCIII. To the &s;ame, containing an Account of his
Excursions and Amu&s;ements.</HEAD>
<OPENER>Dear Mr. Graves,
The Lea&s;owes,
<DATE>Nov. 25, 1758.</DATE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE had daily expectations of a line from
you the&s;e two months: con&s;cious, however, that
I did not de&s;erve any; and affording a manife&s;t in|&s;tance
of the in$atuations of &s;elf-love. The la&s;t let|ter
that I received of yours is dated the clo&s;e of
July, &s;ince which time I have been chiefly engaged
in my cu&s;tomary amu&s;ements; embelli&s;hing my farm,
and receiving the company that cams to &s;ee it. My
<PB N="281" REF="290">
principal <HI>excur&s;ions</HI> have been to Enville, on Lord
Grey's birth-day; to Lord Ward's, upon another
Invitation; and to the Worce&s;ter Mu&s;ic-meeting. I
need not mention what an appearance there was of
company at Worce&s;ter; dazzling enough, you may
&s;uppo&s;e, to a per&s;on who, like me, has not &s;een a
public place the&s;e ten years. Yet I made a &s;hift to
enjoy the &s;plendour, as well as the mu&s;ic that was
prepared for us. I pre&s;ume, nothing in the way of
harmony can po&s;&s;ibly go further than the Oratorio
of &startq;The Me&s;&s;iah.&endq; It &s;eems the be&s;t compo&s;er's be&s;t
compo&s;ition. Yet I fancied I could ob&s;erve <HI>&s;ome parts</HI>
in it, wherein Handel's judgement failed him;
where the ma&s;ic was not equal, or was even <HI>oppo&s;ite,</HI>
to what the words required. Very many of the
noble&s;&s;e, whom I had &s;een at The Lea&s;owes, were as
complai&s;ant to me as po&s;&s;ible; whereas it was my
<HI>former</HI> fate, in public places, to be as little regarded
as a journeyman &s;hoe-maker.&mdash;There I fir&s;t &s;aw our
pre&s;ent Bi&s;hop; al&s;o our late Bi&s;hop's monument,
which is fine.&mdash;La&s;tly, there I fir&s;t &s;aw my Lady
Coventry; to whom, I believe, one mu&s;t allow all
that the world allows in point of beauty. She is
certainly the mo&s;t <HI>unexceptionable</HI> figure of a woman
I ever &s;aw; and made mo&s;t of the ladies there &s;eem
of almo&s;t another <HI>&s;pecies.</HI> On the whole, I was not
a little plea&s;ed that I had made this excur&s;ion; and
returned with double reli&s;h to the <HI>enjoyment</HI> of my
<HI>farm.</HI> It is now high time to take &s;ome notice of
<PB N="282" REF="291">
your obliging letter. I think I was not told the
purport of the journey you made to London; &s;o can
only &s;ay, I am very &s;orry for the aggravating circum|&s;tances
of your di&s;appointment; and hope, long be|fore
this time, that Mrs. Graves is quite recovered.&mdash;Did
I forget to make your excu&s;es to Dod&s;ley or
no?&mdash;he was here (as I remember) &s;oon after, with
Mr. Spence, in their way to Scotland&mdash;Mr. Spence,
the very man <HI>you</HI> would like, and who would like <HI>you,</HI>
of all mankind. He took my Elegies into Scotland,
and &s;ent them back on his return, with a &s;heet or
two of critici&s;ms, and an hand&s;ome letter.&mdash;How
much am I intere&s;ted in the pre&s;ervation of his friend|&s;hip!&mdash;
and yet, &s;uch is my <HI>de&s;tiny</HI> (for I can give
it no other name), I have never wrote to him <HI>&s;ince.</HI>
This <HI>impartiality</HI> of my neglect, you mu&s;t accept <HI>your|&s;elf</HI>
as <HI>&s;ome</HI> apology: but to proceed; Mr. Spence
cho&s;e him&s;elf an oak here for a &s;eat, which I have

abilities. However, it is not too late, even if you
care to publi&s;h it this winter.&mdash;His play comes on
(I fancy <HI>this very night</HI>) at Covent-garden. What
he &s;ays in behalf of this &s;tep is, that there was no
glimp&s;e of probability, that Garrick would ever ad|mit
it at the other hou&s;e<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">He &s;ays, the players liked it, and &s;eemed inclined to take pains with it.</NOTE>.&mdash;Mrs. Bellamy is his
Cleone, and &s;peaks the epilogue, of which more anon.
I &s;uppo&s;e he acts by Lord Che&s;terfield's opinion: for
I know, when he was going to print it (&s;ince he
came home) with a <HI>proper</HI> dedication to Mr. Garrick,
my Lord then prevented him, telling him, it <HI>would</HI>
be acted one day or other.&mdash;Did I ever &s;end you a
copy of the epilogue, with all the additions and al|terations? Dod&s;ley fir&s;t liked, then di&s;liked it, and
la&s;tly liked it again; only de&s;iring me to &s;often the
&s;atire, &s;horten the whole (for it was upwards of &s;ixty
lines), and add a complimentary clo&s;e to the <HI>boxes.</HI>
All this I have endeavoured, and &s;ent it him la&s;t Mon|day.
<HI>You</HI> would not care to own it: and he would
fain have <HI>me;</HI> but I think neither of us &s;hould run
the ri&s;que, where &s;o little honour is to be acquired;
yet Mr. Melmoth's name to the prologue is an in|ducement.&mdash;
I was very near &s;urprizing you at Cla|verton
this autumn, with my friend young Knight,
in his way to Mr. Bamfylde's; but he goes <HI>again</HI> in
&s;pring, and I mall certainly accompany him; I have

Were you and I le&s;s intimate, le&s;s experienced,

MR. Dod&s;ley tells me, he received a letter from

at Bath: I &s;hould be glad to receive from you any
particulars of its &s;ucce&s;s. He is publi&s;hing an elegant
edition of it, which I expect by this very po&s;t. The
new plate of my grove, which will appear at the end
of his Melpomene, is perhaps liable to &s;ome excep|tions,
but by much the be&s;t that has yet appeared:
do not forget to &s;end me your objections to it. As
to the epilogue, I have totally bani&s;hed, I think,
every one of the lines which he <HI>&s;ub&s;tituted;</HI> have left
to him the choice of two or three readings for the
four la&s;t lines; and though none of them quite plea&s;e
me, yet the epilogue, on the whole, di&s;covers more
of genius, is more &s;pirited, and le&s;s inaccurate. I
&s;hall be glad to find that you think the &s;ame with

<P>IN regard to your place, &s;o far as I can form an

more <HI>adequate</HI> materials than either your fortune or
perhaps your place. Do not imagine, however, that

<P>DEPEND upon it, I &s;hall &s;ee Claverton before

As to Dod&s;ley's publi&s;hing this winter, he may po&s;|&s;ibly

con&s;iders that they are, or ought to be, the &s;tandard

to give them the poli&s;h of another &s;ummer. 'Twas

literally tran&s;lated from Phaedrus was &startq;The Wolf

<P>As to the in&s;cription, I will endeavour to adju&s;t

<OPENER>Dear Mr. Graves,
The Lea&s;owes,

<P>THOUGH I write to you again &s;o &s;oon, yet it
really grieves me to hear the complaint which
you &s;o often make for want of time. I, who have
time to <HI>wa&s;te</HI> by lu&s;tres, cannot have patience with
the world, that &s;uffers <HI>you</HI> to want the lei&s;ure which
you would employ to &s;o much better purpo&s;es. Per|haps,
however, you are as <HI>happy</HI> as more lei&s;ure could
<HI>make</HI> you; the ca&s;e is not &s;o <HI>clear</HI> as to leave me
&s;atisfied of the contrary. And yet, as the plea&s;ures
of imagination have an undoubted claim to a real
exi&s;tence, they mu&s;t &s;urely afford very <HI>lively</HI> &s;en&s;a|tions
to per&s;ons of your &s;en&s;ibility and refinement.&mdash;Be
this as it may, I <HI>will</HI> always <HI>murmur</HI> that you
can &s;o ill &s;pare time for literary amu&s;ement. Never|thele&s;s,
make <HI>one</HI> effort, and fini&s;h the ta&s;k you have
now before you. I mu&s;t confe&s;s, you may naturally
reply, that I am now become an intere&s;ted per&s;on;
<PB N="304" REF="313">
but <HI>this,</HI> I am &s;ure, will be no check to your acti|vity.</P>
<P>MR. William Duncombe &s;ent (with the fir&s;t vo|lume
of Horace) one of the &s;atires in M&s;. <HI>in&s;cribed to

I find <HI>my</HI> name is changed to &startq;Hawke&s;worth.&endq;&mdash;Who
knows but I lo&s;t this compliment by writing to you,
my friend, while I &s;hould have been writing to him?&mdash;
if &s;o, indeed, you ought to make it up to me;
and I am &s;ure I &s;hall prize <HI>your</HI> compliment beyond
that of which I have been deprived.</P>
<P>THE view of B&mdash;, which you mention, I have in|deed
&s;een a long time ago; but &s;urely the <HI>water-fall</HI>
is quite dete&s;table. There is &s;omething on each &s;ide,
as I remember, that puts one in mind of a porridge|pot
boiling over beneath the pot-lid. The appear|ance
of the hou&s;e and the back-ground is better;
this was adju&s;ted by the painter, the other (as I think
Smith told me) by an old hou&s;e-&s;teward of Lord
T&mdash;'s.</P>
<P>I HAVE inclo&s;ed another copy of the lines to Venus,
for your emendation.&mdash;Thank you for the &s;tanza you

<PB N="305" REF="314">

ea&s;ier.</P>
<P>You will ob&s;erve, that I take great liberties with
the Fables you a&s;k me to revi&s;e.&mdash;Dod&s;ley mu&s;t think
me <HI>very</HI> fanta&s;tical or <HI>wor&s;e,</HI> while I was correcting
tho&s;e he wrote at The Lea&s;owes.&mdash;I find my <HI>ear</HI>
much more apt to take offence th&aacute;n mo&s;t other peo|ple's;
and, as <HI>his</HI> is far le&s;s delicate than mine, he
mu&s;t of cour&s;e believe, in many places, that I altered
merely for alteration's &s;ake. I cannot be ea&s;y with|out

&startq;&s;elon.&endq;</P>
<P>I HAVE not written to Dod&s;ley any decent letter

now apply my&s;elf to write half a &s;core Fables, and,
if he chu&s;es it, a tran&s;lation of La Motte's Di&s;cour&s;e
upon the &s;ubject.&mdash;Your reply in regard to the de|lay
of <HI>my</HI> publication cannot be an&s;wered; that is
certain.</P>
<P>WHITFIELD'S Journal, I <HI>fear,</HI> is purged of its
<HI>mo&s;t</HI> ridiculous pa&s;&s;ages.&mdash;Dod&s;ley brought one down

which I &s;aw in your brother's at Mickleton.</P>
<P>THE painter whom I ju&s;t mentioned to have taken
&s;ome portraits through my recommendation, and to
have painted a ruin for my green-room, offers to
give me my picture if I chu&s;e to &s;it.-Were you
here to lend me your a&s;&s;i&s;tance, I &s;hould certainly
comply.&mdash;Mean while, tell me what you think of
&s;ome of the attitudes that I inclo&s;e. What I my&s;elf
prefer at pre&s;ent is, to <HI>le&s;&s;en</HI> my <HI>dimen&s;ions</HI> (which of
it&s;elf gives a kind of beauty), and to appear in a
kind of night-gown agreeable to the attitude mark|ed
AA. The man evidently hits off likene&s;&s;es, and
is e&s;teemed to <HI>&s;hine</HI> among the painters of Birming|ham.
I &s;hall be forced to have your picture copied
by him, which, by means of dampne&s;s, flies off the
canvas; &s;o that, on the whole, I &s;hall re-pay his
compliment.&mdash;This la&s;t article puts me in mind that
I owe you my picture, whenever you demand it; but

<OPENER>Dear Mr. Graves,
The Lea&s;owes,
<DATE>Jan. 8, 1760.</DATE></OPENER>
<P>WERE I to regulate my compliments by the
arrival of <HI>times</HI> and &s;ea&s;ons, I &s;hould congra|tulate
you upon a <HI>corre&s;pondence</HI> which now enters
upon its three and twentieth year.&mdash;Our <HI>friend&s;hip</HI> is
of &s;omething older date; and is not this an <HI>atchieve|ment</HI>
that de&s;erves the honour of a <HI>triumph</HI> both for
you and me too?&mdash;More, I am &s;ure, than the regular
de&s;truion of fifteen or twenty thou&s;and wretches in
the field con&s;idering how <HI>uncommon</HI> we find friend|&s;hips
of &s;o long a duration, and how <HI>cheap</HI> we find
&s;uch victories, not only on the Pru&s;&s;ian, but on the
Au&s;trian &s;ide.</P>
<P>MR. Cambridge (Scriblerus), who called here this
autumn, was con&s;idering this ma&s;&s;acre rather in a phi|lo&s;ophical
than political view; and, indeed, it does
not appear to me that plague, earthquake, or famine,
are more pernicious to the human race, than what
the world calls Heroes; but enough of this.</P>
<P>YOUR want of lei&s;ure gives me pain; &s;urely, if I
may gue&s;s by one or two of your la&s;t letters, you
have enlarged the number of your &s;cholars, and ex|tended
your domsitic cares, beyond what your cir|cum&s;tance.
<HI>require.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="308" REF="317">
You mu&s;t not judge of my painter's abilities by
the &s;mall &s;ketch I inclo&s;e.&mdash;I de&s;ired him to give me
a <HI>&s;light</HI> one; and have, perhaps, ruined even <HI>that</HI>
by endeavouring to bring it nearer to what the picture
now <HI>is, my&s;elf.</HI> It will give you a tolerable idea in
mo&s;t points, except the Pan, which has his face turn|ed
towards the front; and is not near &s;o con&s;idera|ble.&mdash;
I cho&s;e to have this <HI>term</HI> introduced, not only
as he carries my favourite reeds, but as he is the
principal <HI>&s;ylvan</HI> deity.&mdash;The Water-nymph below
has the word &startq;Stour&endq; on the mouth of her urn;
which, in &s;ome fort, ri&s;es at The Lea&s;owes. On the
&s;croll is, &startq;Flumina amem &s;ylva&s;que inglorius,&endq; al|luding
to them <HI>both.</HI>&mdash;The Pan, you will perhaps ob|&s;erve,
hurts the <HI>&s;implicity</HI> of the picture&mdash;not much,
as we have managed him; and the intention here is,
I think, a balance.</P>
<P>THE dog on the other &s;ide is my faithful Lucy,
which you perhaps remember; and who <HI>mu&s;t</HI> be
<HI>nearer</HI> the <HI>body</HI> than &s;he perhaps would if we had
more room. However, I believe, I &s;hall cau&s;e her
head to cut off that little clu&s;ter of angles, where the
balu&s;trade joins the ba&s;e of the arch. The balu&s;|trade
is an improvement we made the other day:
it is, I think, a great one; not only as it gives a
&s;ymmetry or balance to the curtain of which you
complained, bat as it extends the <HI>area</HI> on which I
<PB N="309" REF="318">
&s;tand, and &s;hortens the <HI>length</HI> of this <HI>half-arch.</HI> The
painter objected to a tree; I know not why; unle&s;s
that we could introduce no <HI>&s;tem</HI> without encroaching
too much upon the land&s;cape: but the rea&s;on he gave
was, it would be an injury to the face. The con|&s;ole
is an Apollo's head. The impo&s;t does not go
further than the pila&s;ter, which ends the corner;
and here the drawing is erroneous. We are, I think,
to have a carpet, though we know not well how to
manage it.</P>
<P>AND now, I mu&s;t tell you the dimen&s;ions. The
figure it&s;elf is three feet, three inches and a half;
the whole picture four feet, eleven inches, by three
feet, two inches and three-quarters.&mdash;The colour of
the gown, a &s;ea-green; wai&s;tcoat and breeches, buff|colour;
&s;tockings white, or rather pearl-colour; cur|tain
a terra-&s;ienna, or very rich reddi&s;h brown.&mdash;I
think the whole will have a good effect; but be&s;eech
you to &s;end me your opinion <HI>directly.</HI> There are &s;ome
things we can alter; but there are others we mu&s;t not.</P>
<P>YOU &s;hall have one of the &s;ize you de&s;ire in the
&s;pring; but will you not calculate for &s;ome one place
in your room? The painter takes very &s;trong like|ne&s;&s;es;
is young; rather daring than delicate in his
manner, though he paints well in enamel; good|natured;
&s;lovenly; would improve much by applica|tion.

<OPENER>Dear Mr. Graves,
The Lea&s;owes,
<DATE>Feb. 9, 1760.</DATE></OPENER>
<P>I COULD not under&s;tand, by Mr. Dod&s;ley's la&s;t
letter to me, that he had any <HI>&s;ort</HI> of intention to
publi&s;h his Fables this winter. Pre&s;uming upon this
delay, and having neither had the <HI>lei&s;ure</HI> nor the
<HI>frame</HI> of mind fit to take his preface into con&s;idera|tion,
I have hitherto deferred to do &s;o; and can only
&s;ay in <HI>general,</HI> that I could wi&s;h you had happened to
be more copious in your ob&s;ervations. La Motte's
Di&s;cour&s;e on Fables is a mo&s;t excellent performance;
containing, as appears to <HI>me,</HI> all that need be &s;aid
upon the &s;ubject, and this expre&s;&s;ed with all imagina|ble
elegance and per&s;picuity. I believe I &s;hall ad|vi&s;e
our friend D&mdash;to make more ample u&s;e of this
di&s;&s;ertation. There is a tran&s;lation of La Motte into
<HI>pro&s;e,</HI> which is altogether <HI>below contempt;</HI> and yet,
for aught I know, the <HI>only</HI> one. The word <HI>na$ve</HI> is
very probably <HI>that</HI> for which he has &s;ub&s;tituted the
world <HI>lively;</HI> though by no means of &s;imilar import.
<HI>Natural</HI> approaches nearer it; but according to La
Motte is not preci&s;e: and, as the words <HI>na&iuml;f</HI> and

if Dod&s;ley approve it, of admitting cuts into your

<P>AND now, from <HI>cuts</HI> I proceed to <HI>pictures.</HI> Al|cock's
portrait of me is in a manner fini&s;hed; and
has been hung up for the&s;e nine days pa&s;t, in its
carved frame, oppo&s;ite to the fire-place in my library.
<HI>They &s;ay</HI> it is a likene&s;s, allowing for the diminution
of &s;ize. Indeed, if I can conclude any thing from
the &s;trong re&s;emblance which he has produced of
<HI>others</HI> here, I may form &s;ome <HI>conjecture</HI> that he has.
not failed in mine.&mdash;Be this as it will, the picture is,
upon the whole, a tolerably plea&s;ing one; and this is
<PB N="314" REF="323">
the <HI>mo&s;t</HI> I mu&s;t dare to &s;ay, con&s;idering my own per|&s;on
makes &s;o large a part of it.</P>
<P>WHAT think you of a tawney or reddi&s;h brown
for the robe or night-gown, with black for the wai&s;t|coat
and breeches, re&s;erving green for the curtain?
though green is, with me at lea&s;t, no very gay colour,
nor has it that <HI>effect</HI> which you apprehended in the
drapery. Terra-&s;ienna is a delightful colour; &s;o, I
think, is Roman ocre burnt. Let me know then,
what objections you have to the drapery ju&s;t now
propo&s;ed. Let me know al&s;o any de&s;ign that you
think mo&s;t plea&s;ing for a back-ground; or any &s;tory
of two or three figures, that would be &s;uitable for a
relievo.</P>
<P>FROM <HI>pictures</HI> I proceed to <HI>painters.</HI> I believe,
Alcock would go and &s;ettle at Bath, if Amos Green
could be induced to join him. Amos Green is the
name of the painter whom I recommended to you
<HI>before my fever.</HI> He is e&s;teemed inferior to no one
in England for fruit. He al&s;o paints flowers, in&s;ects,
and dead-game, <HI>very</HI> well. To this he would adjoin
the bu&s;ine&s;s of water-painting. Alcock would paint
portraits in oil; and to this he would add enamel-painting:
both of them the be&s;t-natured young fel|lows
in the world. Now &s;uppo&s;e them al&s;o <HI>ingenious,</HI>
and tell me whether they would have a chance to
<HI>t$rive.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="315" REF="324">
You ought to have very con&s;iderable <HI>amends,</HI> if
you are to be plagued with writing and with mu&s;ic-ma&s;ters.&mdash;
I believe I rate your time and trouble at
a much higher price than you do your&s;elf.</P>
<P>DR. Black&s;tone has rai&s;ed him&s;elf to a very eminent
figure indeed in the world of letters. I rejoice at
it, without one particle of envy, both as he is your
friend, and a per&s;on of merit. I believe no one be|&s;ides
your&s;elf would have dreamt of your odd ana|logy
betwixt him and me.&mdash;I know not <HI>how</HI> they
came to in&s;ert that in&s;ipid Song of mine&punc; in the
Chronicle.&mdash;What &s;en&s;ation it cau&s;ed in me, was
that of di&s;approbation; as it looked like laying &s;tre&s;s
on what one knows to be of no importance.</P>
<P>THE chief points wherein my picture varies from
your drawing is in the corner below the ba&s;e of the
pede&s;tal; where an antique va&s;e is introduced with
a flower and two or three leaves of the &s;carlet Gera|nium.
The gilt va&s;e agrees well enough with the
gold fringe on the edge of the curtain; but the whole
is &s;o <HI>&s;ubdued,</HI> as not to catch the eye too &s;trongly.
It was chiefly meant to obviate the di&s;agreeablene&s;s
of the <HI>parallel</HI> lines and angles occa&s;ioned by the &s;tep
in that corner; but it crowds that &s;ide a little, if one
look from top to bottom; and, though a plea&s;ing
<PB N="316" REF="325">
object, it is hard to &s;ay whether it do more good or
harm.</P>
<P>IT is time now to take my leave, with my hearty
re&s;pects to Mrs. Graves, and with the u&s;nal a&s;&s;urance,
that I remain your mo&s;t affectionate and faithful

<HEAD>CII. To the &s;ame, on his neglecting his Corre&s;pon|dence.</HEAD>
<OPENER>Dear Mr. Graves,
The Lea&s;owes,
<DATE>July 7, 1760.</DATE></OPENER>
<P>I MUST confe&s;s that I do not altogether find
your argument conclusive.&mdash;An hurry of bu&s;ine&s;s
<HI>may</HI> be nece&s;&s;ary, and &s;omewhat incon&s;i&s;tent with fre|quent
corre&s;pondence; but a &s;tate of <HI>lei&s;ure,</HI> which
I wi&s;hed you, does not imply a cour&s;e of <HI>di&s;&s;ipation;</HI>
which makes your pre&s;ent apology for not writing to
me before. And &s;o, betwixt bu&s;ine&s;s at one time
and di&s;&s;ipation at another, I am to be defrauded of a
corre&s;pondence that is quite e&s;&s;ential to my well-being.
Pardon me, if, on &s;uch occa&s;ion, you find me ex|tremely
clear-&s;ighted in the foibles of my friends;
and do not &s;ay with the man in Horace, &startq;Cur in
amicorum vitiis, &amp;c.&endq; The <HI>matter</HI> is too <HI>important</HI>
for me to connive at any &s;ort of &s;ophi&s;m.&mdash;However,
<PB N="317" REF="326">
to make you ea&s;y on this head, I am convinced the
letter was owing to <HI>you;</HI> for which I will draw my
apology neither from <HI>bu&s;ine&s;s</HI> nor di&s;&s;ipation: and yet
how ju&s;tly might I palliate my long &s;ilence upon
<HI>either</HI> footing! Since I wrote to you, I have been
<HI>bufied</HI> in bringing about a conclu&s;ion with D&mdash;. The
letters, journies, &amp;c. <HI>previous</HI> and <HI>po&s;terior</HI> to the exe|cution
of articles, would afford me noble matter for
excu&s;e.&mdash;The con&s;tant attendance upon workmen (of
which I have fourteen or fifteen this very day), mak|ing
a piece of water below my Priory, would pro|duce
more on the &s;core of <HI>di&s;&s;ipation</HI>&mdash;you remember
the place. This, at pre&s;ent, is my chief employment,
although Alcock is drawing on the &s;ide of my table.&mdash;
I wonder you do not get &s;ome little urns turned,
in any &s;ort of wood, about fourteen or fifteen inches
high, and painted on the &s;ide with figures, in the
manner of &s;ome antique ba&s;&s;o-relievo. He has done
&s;omething of this &s;ort for me. You may, if you &s;o
plea&s;e, have the ground a dark <HI>bronze,</HI> and the figures
a <HI>light</HI> one. I am of late grown fond of bronze
(which you your&s;elf may ea&s;ily execute), and I think
it always was your ta&s;te.&mdash;Dod&s;ley comes hither in
about a fortnight, and prints <HI>one</HI> edition of his
Fables by means of Ba&s;kerville's pre&s;s and paper.
<HI>Mean time,</HI> he is to <HI>give</HI> me his picture done by Rey|nolds;
and to <HI>&s;end</HI> me two bronzed pla&s;ter urns, of
about twelve inches, with ba&s;&s;o-relievo; and two
figures (ditto) of Homer and Virgil (of about twenty|one
<PB N="318" REF="327">
one inches) for two niches in my library. The parcel
is to be pieced out with Ogilby's Virgil, which I
want for the &s;ake of the land&s;capes.&mdash;And now to the
particulars of your letter.</P>
<P>I CAN readily conceive how much greater plea&s;ure
you mu&s;t receive from the <HI>retinue</HI> of your journey,
than an Archbi&s;hop can from all his equipage; and
I can truly allure you, I find a plea&s;ure in every plea|&s;ure
you enjoy.</P>
<P>YOUR room, indeed, will be a noble one; but be
&s;ure remember the &startq;Imploravit opes hominis, fr|ae|numque

my &s;entiments, I think you will. I think with you
in regard to Tri&s;tram Shandy; &s;o does the author of
the Monthly Review, you will &s;ee. I bought Webb
in&s;tantly; but have not read it. Lord Lyttelton is
<HI>allowedly</HI> the author of tho&s;e Dialogues; who&s;e the
very la&s;t, I do not know. There is a noble &s;pecimen
of Scotch poetry tran&s;lated from the Er&s;e language
&mdash;I have had two copies &s;ent me from Scotland;
and, had I two franks, would &s;end you one. &startq;Chry|&s;al, or The Adventures of a Guinea&endq; (real charac|ters
intended), will amu&s;e you. Something <HI>ever</HI> oc|curs
that ob&s;tructs my travelling at all&mdash;and though
I long <HI>ardently</HI> to vi&s;it you, the Lord knows when it
will be; yet <HI>be</HI> it certainly will, when I accompany
Mr. Knight to Mr. Bamfylde's: where I am pre&s;&s;ingly
<PB N="319" REF="328">

<OPENER>Dear Mr. Graves,
The Lea&s;owes,
<DATE>Mar. 1, 1761.</DATE></OPENER>
<P>ALTHOUGH this interval in our corre&s;pon|dence
mu&s;t be placed, I fear, to <HI>my</HI> account, you
will hardly think it mends the matter to <HI>fill</HI> my pre|&s;ent
letter even with the be&s;t-grounded apologies&mdash;
I will only mention a bad &s;tate of health, which has
been my lot this winter, as a general excu&s;e for two
or three months &s;ilence; and then declare, as with,
truth I may, that the e&s;teem and affection which you
have &s;o well de&s;erved of me have never undergone
the lea&s;t diminution or abatement. It is with me a
melancholy ta&s;k, to <HI>write</HI> letters when I am not well;
although it be the time, of all others, when it is mo&s;t
nece&s;&s;ary for me to <HI>receive</HI> them.&mdash;Our friend Dod|&s;ley,
I pre&s;ume, has &s;ent you a book of his Fables
before this time. What merit I have there, is in
the <HI>E&s;&s;ay;</HI> in the <HI>original Fables,</HI> although I can hard|ly
claim a &s;ingle Fable as my own; and in the <HI>Index,</HI>
which I cau&s;ed to be thrown into the form of <HI>Morals,</HI>
<PB N="320" REF="329">
and which are almo&s;t wholly mine. I wi&s;h to God
it may &s;ell; for he has been at great expence about
it. The two rivals which he has to dread are, the
editions of Richard&s;on and of Croxall.&mdash;The <HI>Fables</HI>
in Croxall are tolerably written: his <HI>reflections,</HI> little
to the purpo&s;e, either for boys or grown people.&mdash;
Richard&s;on's <HI>Improvement of L'E&s;trange</HI> would be a bet|ter
collection, both for the <HI>Fables</HI> and the <HI>moral Re|flections,</HI>
had he not admitted, through an extravagant
and mi&s;taken love of drollery, that vulgarity of
phra&s;e which in many places is not <HI>common Engli&s;h.</HI>&mdash;
This I think a true &s;tate of the ca&s;e: &s;ay the be&s;t
you can in behalf of Dod&s;ley.&mdash;As to his cuts, though
to <HI>him</HI> expen&s;ive, they will hardly, I fear, meet with
much of your approbation&mdash;the &s;cale is much too
&s;mall&mdash;and the emblematic prints which are larger
will &s;carce, I fear, be under&s;tood.&mdash;I procured a copy
from Ba&s;kerville <HI>before</HI> the plates were <HI>in&s;erted,</HI> and
have eau&s;ed my painter (Alcock) to &s;upply the va|cancies
with &s;ome devices of my own&mdash;&s;ome account
of which I &s;end you, as it may amu&s;e you for a minute.
I want one or two to compleat my &s;cheme, and &s;hould
be glad if you would propo&s;e &s;ome in your next letter.&mdash;
I return you my hearty thanks for the hints you
gave for the Cambridge ver&s;es; but when I received
them it was too late, and I my&s;elf too much indi&s;|po&s;ed,
either to throw them into proper form, or
even to an&s;wer that gentleman's letter, which I
thought a very genteel one.&mdash;I know not what he did
<PB N="321" REF="330">
on that occa&s;ion, having &s;een neither Cambridge nor
Oxford ver&s;es&mdash;Mr. Dod&s;ley gave me &startq;The En|virons

may find five thon&s;and readers, whom the manage|ment
of that work plea&s;es more than <HI>me.</HI>&mdash;I will try
to get you &s;ome of the <HI>cuts,</HI> if you de&s;ire me to do
&s;o, though it will reflect a kind of tacit di&s;like of
the <HI>whole</HI> performance.&mdash;His brother publi&s;hes this
winter &startq;The Works of Soame Jenyns,&endq; in three
pocket-volumes; and a Chine&s;e novel from a M&s;.
tran&s;lation, revi&s;ed, &amp;c. by a friend of mine. You
have perhaps heard me &s;peak of Mr. Percy&mdash;he <HI>was</HI>

of our be&s;t old ballads in three volumes.&mdash;He
has a large folio M&s;. of ballads, which he &s;hewed me,
and which, with his own natural and acquired ta|lents,
would qualify him for the purpo&s;e as well as
any man in England. I propo&s;ed the &s;cheme for
him <HI>my&s;elf,</HI> wi&s;hing to &s;ee an elegant <HI>edition</HI> and good
collection of this kind.&mdash;I was al&s;o to have a&s;&s;i&s;ted
him in &s;electing and rejecting; and in fixing upon
the bell readings: but my illne&s;s broke off our cor|re&s;pondence,

I had not gone. In the two <HI>former</HI> re&s;pects, the
journey an&s;wered my expectation:&mdash;but, alas! your
brother was gone into Hereford&s;hire. I, however,
alighted out of the chai&s;e; and the hou&s;e-keeper very
civilly &s;hewed me his delightful parlour, that looks
into the meadows, the Prebends' gardens, and down
the Severn to Malvern-hills. A more agreeable
<PB N="327" REF="336">
town-hou&s;e cannot po&s;&s;ibly be found any where. But
I regretted, when I reached the inn, that I had not
a&s;ked to &s;ee his children; for I either heard them up|&s;tairs,
had a glimp&s;e of them at the window, or fan|cied,
to a degree of conviction, that they were mo&s;t
of them within the hou&s;e. I now return to remark
upon &s;ome particulars in your letter&mdash;I believe it is
that indifference you complain of, which is the <HI>grand</HI>
detriment to genius in an advanced part of life. In
all <HI>poetical</HI> affairs, we are too apt to cry out with
Pallas, &startq;Non e&s;t mihi tibia tanti;&endq; and this ren|ders
all our efforts tame, pro&s;aic, and judicious. But
this propensity, as well as many others, we &s;hould
guard again&s;t, upon the approach of age; change
the object of our amu&s;ements; cheri&s;h hopes, well or
ill-grounded, of finding that plea&s;ure in the novelty
of objects, which we have not found in any indi|vidual.
The&s;e are the means of <HI>pre&s;erving our vi|vacity</HI>
a &s;omewhat longer time than it naturally la&s;ts;
but how far it is <HI>prudent</HI> to attach our&s;elves to the
world that we mu&s;t leave, is a point which <HI>you</HI> better
can determine. Refined ta&s;te, as it implies a <HI>love</HI> of
phy&s;ical beauty, has this tendency.</P>
<P>THERE is nothing can be more rational than what
you &s;ay about the expediency of <HI>lo&s;ing no time,</HI> if I
mean to collect and publi&s;h what I have written.
You are indeed very partial to my abilities; but, al|lowing
for <HI>that,</HI> what you mention <HI>coincides</HI> with
<PB N="323" REF="337">
what I have thought my&s;elf, and this for &s;ome years
pa&s;t. A more agreeable kind of <HI>di&s;traction</HI> in &s;um|mer,
and an indifferent &s;tate of health and &s;pirits in
winter, have hitherto prevented any progre&s;s in the
correction of my pieces. To the&s;e I might add a
<HI>&s;u&s;pence</HI> about the compo&s;itions, and the manner pro|per
for publication. I am now mo&s;t inclined to
make a collection of the whole; I mean, the be&s;t of
what are already printed or in M&s;; to publi&s;h them
by &s;ub&s;cription in a large <HI>quarto</HI> &s;ize for the &s;ake of
profit; and to apologize for this method, by mention|ing
the expence of top and tail-pieces, with which
I mean they &s;hall be embelli&s;hed. Some of <HI>the&s;e</HI> (by
the bye) may be taken from my farm, the re&s;t em|blematical,
in an ea&s;y and carele&s;s, but, at the &s;ame
time, elegant, manner. I &s;hould think the in&s;tance
of Mr. Pope might render this method not di&s;reputa|ble;
and it might be adverti&s;ed (as was done by Mr.
Spence), that, unle&s;s a certain number were &s;ub&s;cribed
for, the whole affair &s;hould be no farther pro&s;ecuted.
This would put it in the way of many friends to &s;erve
me, who (I flatter my&s;elf), <HI>with inclination,</HI> e&s;teem
them&s;elves void of <HI>opportunity.</HI> Let me beg you to
think &s;eriou&s;ly of this, as well as of a general title|page,
before you write again.</P>
<P>THANK you kindly for all the little diverting
anecdotes that are contained in your letter. I am
glad to hear your <HI>place</HI> brings you company; partly,
<PB N="329" REF="338">
as it tends to amu&s;e you; and yet more, as it tends
to make your merit more con&s;picuous. You and I

you to &s;eek &s;ome <HI>advantage</HI> from your commerce
with <HI>great men.</HI>&mdash;The boy, who was here with you
and Mrs. Graves, was here la&s;t Friday evening with a
Mr. Jolliffe and his &s;on; the latter of whom ob&s;erved
your name upon the bench, and &s;eemed proud to
declare that he was once your &s;chool-fellow. Mr.
Stratford (to whom I had written about gold|fi&s;hes)
&s;ays in his an&s;wer, &startq;I had the plea&s;ure from
Bath of waiting upon Mr. G&mdash;, and was as much
&s;atisfied with the miniature beauties of his place,
as with the polite reception I met with from the

oblige me by pre&s;enting my compliments to that

&s;tands high in my e&s;teem.&mdash;The account of Gothic
architecture, &amp;c. is curious; but I have found it in
Dr. Warburton's edition of Pope.&mdash;I inclo&s;e the

my intentions, &amp;c. concerning them; and &s;ince, I
hear that they have appeared in &s;ome one of the

I &s;urely gave a copy to nobody be&s;ides; and tho&s;e

<PB N="330" REF="339">
not know of Mr. Warton's compliment; but he is
very obliging to me on all occa&s;ions, and &s;ends me
all that he publishes.&mdash;I have not yet read Dr. Robin|&s;on's
Hi&s;tory, to my &s;hame be it &s;poken, though
I have the honour to. know the author.&mdash;I hope the

<P>I SEE my friend Dod&s;ley has <HI>let off</HI> his little <HI>&s;quib</HI>
upon the marriage, in the Chronicle. &startq;<HI>The King

me, from Ba&s;kerville's pre&s;s, on the &s;ame occa&s;ion,
very <HI>pomp$$&s;ly</HI> printed, the mo&s;t de&s;picable Grub-&s;treet
I ever &s;aw.</P>
<P>I HAVE made &s;ome little improvements about my
place; have taken away the wall in front, and made
a hand&s;ome ring; have extended my path, in one
p$ece of ground, greatly for the better&mdash;but the
grand water in the valley will make no figure till
next &s;pring.</P>
<P>I HAVE al&s;o a&s;&s;i&s;ted my friend Hull the comedian
in altering the Tragedy of &startq;Ro&s;amond;&endq; had it
brought upon the &s;tage to a full hou&s;e at Birming|ham,
where it was very well received; put Hull into
a way of making an indirect compliment to the pre|&s;ent
King in the ten la&s;t lines of his Epilogue, which
<PB N="331" REF="340">
was followed by &startq;God &s;ave great George,&endq; &amp;c. in a
full chorus of the audience and actors drawn out
abrea&s;t upon the &s;tage.</P>
<P>SINCE this, there has been depo&s;ited in my hands
a large collection of Poetry, by a Mi&s;s Wheatly of
Wal&s;all: many of the pieces written in an excellent
and truly cla&s;&s;ical &s;tyle; &s;imple, &s;entimental, harmo|nious,
and more correct than I almo&s;t ever &s;aw writ|ten
by a lady. They will be publi&s;hed, I believe, by
&s;ub&s;cription, under the patronage of Lord Dart|mouth.</P>
<P>BUT nothing in the poetical way has plea&s;ed me
better than a compliment which I received about nine
days ago by the po&s;t, under the feigned name <HI>Cot|&s;wouldia.</HI>&mdash;She
mu&s;t be &s;ome Glouce&s;ter&s;hire lady that

It &s;eems written by &s;omebody of fa&s;hion by the &s;tyle.&mdash;Can
you form any conjecture?</P>
<P>THERE was a Mr. Freeman of Bet&s;tow (or &s;ome
&s;uch name) with two or three ladies in a coach and
&s;ix that were here not long before; a very genteel

<P>I REALLY know not how to &s;top, when I begin a

<HEAD>CVI. To the &s;ame, &s;ugge&s;ting to him a Subject for
Poetry.</HEAD>
<OPENER>Dear Mr. Graves,
The Lea&s;owes,
<DATE>May 20, 1762.</DATE></OPENER>
<P>I FIND you will <HI>not</HI> write, unle&s;s I give a regular
an&s;wer to your letters; and yet, God knows, I
have a better excu&s;e for my delay, than I wi&s;h my
friend to have for his punctilio; I mean, indi&s;po&s;i|tion.&mdash;Whence
is has happened, I cannot &s;ay, unle&s;s
I may blame the&s;e continual ea&s;t winds; but I have
&s;uffered more from the &s;miles of Spring, than I have
really done from the frowns of Winter.</P>
<P>HAVING premi&s;ed thus much, I lay your letter
before me. The expence of printing a &s;$eet of tho&s;e
commendatory ver&s;es at a common pre&s;s is eighteen
shillings; and at Ba&s;kerville's about three pounds,
ten &s;hillings: nor do I mean any decorations, unle&s;s
perhaps &startq;The King-fi&s;her,&endq; or &startq;View of my
Grove,&endq; which, you know, I <HI>have</HI> engraven ready
to <HI>my</HI> hands. So you &s;ee that <HI>this</HI> offering to vanity
is not likely to be the mo&s;t expen&s;ive.</P>
<P><PB N="333" REF="342">
I WISH you had be&s;towed &s;omewhat more attention
upon <HI>the title;</HI> in which ca&s;e, I really believe the job
had been executed long ago. Pray be &s;o kind as to
re-con&s;ider it.&mdash;Is not &startq;The Garland of Friend&s;hip&endq;
a little too quaint? for that, as I remember, was what
I propo&s;ed.&mdash;The <HI>motto</HI> which you propo&s;ed was a
very good one; and I think al&s;o, that the addition
of the next line would be an improvement to it;
&startq;Et i&s;ti errori nomen virtus po&s;ui&s;&s;et hone&s;tum.&endq;
But I do not love <HI>double</HI> mottoes; &s;o, if I admit this,
I mu&s;t exclude what I propo&s;ed; which, to &s;peak the
truth, was of my own invention.</P>
<P>THE cu&s;tom of prefixing commendatory ver&s;es to
collections of poetry is now &s;eemingly grown ob&s;o|lete.
Be&s;ides, in my ca&s;e, they would only &s;hew
that I had <HI>taken</HI> up more fame than my funds would
an&s;wer. I return you many thanks for <HI>your</HI> poetical
benevolence; but why do you mention it under the
name of <HI>Epigram?</HI> I do not even chu&s;e that it &s;hould
have the air of <HI>&s;imile</HI> from the <HI>beginning:</HI>
<Q><L>&startq;Lo the tall youth, by partial fate's decree,</L>
<L>To affluence born, and from re&s;traint &s;et free;</L>
<L>How pleas'd he, &amp;c.&endq;</L></Q></P>
<P>I HAVE taken <HI>this</HI> and &s;ome <HI>other</HI> liberties with it,
and &s;hall in&s;ert it among the re&s;t; unle&s;s you chu&s;e
to <HI>redeem</HI> it, with &s;omething more to your &s;atisfaction:
<PB N="334" REF="343">
for, to &s;peak with frankne&s;&s;, I think it better calcu|lated
to do <HI>me</HI> honour than <HI>your&s;elf;</HI> though I could
e&s;teem it <HI>good,</HI> if it came from a per&s;on who&s;e abili|ties
I re&s;pected le&s;s than yours. There is a &s;ubject
here, which I would recommend to you, if by &s;o
doing I &s;hould lay you under no <HI>re&s;traint.</HI> It is my
principal ca&s;cade. Its appearance well re&s;embles the
playfulne&s;s of infancy; &s;kipping from &s;ide to &s;ide,
with a thou&s;and antic motions, that an&s;wer no other
purpo&s;e than the mere amu&s;ement of the proprietor.&mdash;
Other &s;imilitudes, &amp; c, would here occur;
<Q>&startq;Cui enim na&s;centi faciles arri&s;erunt Mu&s;ae, &amp;c.&endq;</Q>
It then proceeds a few hundred yards, where it <HI>rolls</HI>
and <HI>&s;lits iron</HI> for manufactures of all kinds; re|&s;embling
the graver toils of manhood, either in ac|quiring
money, or furni&s;hing the conveniencies, com|forts,
or ornaments of life: and in this manner it
proceeds, under the name of The Stour, &s;upplying
works for ca&s;ting, forging and &s;naping iron, for every
civil or military purpo&s;e. Perhaps you may not know
that my rills are the principal &s;ources of this river;
or that this river &s;upplies <HI>more</HI> iron-works than al|mo&s;t
any &s;ingle river in the kingdom: for &s;o my
friend Mr. Knight told me.</P>
<P>THE Mr. D&mdash;you enquire after, and who wrote
the <HI>be&s;t</HI> addre&s;s Sir Robert Walpole ever <HI>received,</HI> is
Mr. Dodington.&mdash;Did I never &s;end you a li&s;t of all

it out when I find an opportunity; as I purpo&s;e al&s;o
to give you &s;ome account of our &s;everal merits in
Dod&s;ley's Fables. By the way, do not the ver&s;es to
Dr. Cornwallis (now Bi&s;hop) affect you &s;en&s;ibly, vol.
VI. p. 138?&mdash;they do <HI>me,</HI> whenever I read them;
aud I cannot help applying them to my&s;elf. I feel
&s;omewhat of the &s;ame &s;en&s;ation when I read &startq;The
Letters of Henry and Frances;&endq; in which (from
&s;elf-partiality, no doubt) I find my&s;elf extremely like
Henry.</P>
<P>PRAY let me hear, if you plea&s;e, of Mr. Daven|port.&mdash;I
wi&s;h I had learnt to <HI>draw</HI> well in early life;
it would have given me &s;ome very great advantages.&mdash;Let
me hear al&s;o much of Mr. Melmoth, who, I
pre&s;ume, has left you long before this time. I did
once de&s;ign to have &s;ent you down my propo&s;als for
a &s;ub&s;cription, and reque&s;ted the favour of <HI>you two</HI>
to &s;ettle them finally, without any further reference
to my&s;elf; but my head and &s;pirits have been too
bad to undertake even a common letter.&mdash;What think
you or Dr. Lowth's Grammar?&mdash;Livie met him at
Mr. Dod&s;ley's; and &s;ays, he is well plea&s;ed with <HI>our</HI>
fronti&s;piece, &amp;c. to Horace. Livie could not pre&s;ent
his book to Lord Bute, <HI>him&s;elf,</HI> on account of my
Lord's indi&s;po&s;ition. Mr. Dalton (Dr. Dalton's bro|ther),
<PB N="336" REF="345">
who teaches the King to draw, pre&s;ented it.
It &s;eems, this Dr. Dalton (who gave the drawing
of Lord Bute's arms) has lodgings in the palace,
and &s;ees the King every day. <HI>While</HI> Livie was <HI>with</HI>
him, word came that the King was coming into his
room; upon which, Livie was &s;ent out another way.&mdash;
The King a&s;ked Dalton, whom he had with him?&mdash;and
was an&s;wered, an editor of Horace, who had
in&s;cribed it to Lord Bute.&mdash;Daltqn is to pre&s;ent a
copy to the King,</P>
<P>I INCLOSE to you a &s;pecimen of the decorated parts
of Horace, with the fronti&s;piece.&mdash;The book will be
publi&s;hed in a month's time, when I mean you a
copy from tho&s;e that are allotted to me.</P>
<P>MY Lord Bute's arms are unexceptionably well-fini&s;hed.&mdash;
The other plates, either through negli|gence,
or the wilfulne&s;s of the de&s;igner and engraver,
have given me infinite trouble and vexation. How|ever,
with about <HI>two-thirds</HI> of my directions ob&s;erved,
they will, I hope, afford you &s;ome plea&s;ure; and dis|cover
&s;omewhat more <HI>beauty</HI> and <HI>&s;pirit</HI> than one com|monly

<HEAD>CVII. To the &s;ame.</HEAD>
<OPENER>Dear Mr. Graves,
The Lea&s;owes,
<DATE>Nov. 20, 1762.</DATE></OPENER>
<P>DO I really owe you an apology? you who are
embarra&s;&s;ed with &s;uch a number of momen|tous
concerns, as hardly allow a fair trial to letters of
mere amu&s;ement? Alas! I cannot &s;helter my long
&s;ilence under a &s;uppo&s;ition of this kind. I believe,
I even <HI>hope,</HI> that you have di&s;approved my long neg|lect;
as I can very faithfully a&s;&s;ure you I have repeated|ly
done <HI>my&s;elf.</HI> There are certain times and &s;ea&s;ons
when I have not either the <HI>power</HI> or the <HI>will</HI> to
write: as Hannibal &s;aid about attacking Rome,
&startq;quandoque mentem non dari, quandoque pote&s;ta|tem.&endq;
This being an intellectual kind of <HI>lethargy,</HI>
it would have been at lea&s;t a friendly office, if you
had <HI>rouzed</HI> me, as you <HI>might</HI> have done, by a &s;uper|numerary
letter. I never receive a line from you,
but I feel an almo&s;t irre&s;i&s;tible propensity to an&s;wer
it that very in&s;tant. Impediments &s;ometimes occur;
and, that in&s;tant being neglected, matter is accumu|lated
for a longer letter than I am always re&s;olute
enough to undertake: at the &s;ame time, I can never
content my&s;elf with uttering one half of what I have
to &s;ay.&mdash;Pray is not that <HI>good &s;ort of man,</HI> to whom
you allude, a Mr. K&mdash;? Let him be ever &s;o good a
&s;ort of man in the common e&s;timation, I dare aver
him to be neither an ingenious per&s;on nor a candid
<PB N="338" REF="347">
critic. There may be fifty or more preferable read|ing
to what are received in this new Horace; yet he
will find a better <HI>text</HI> there, <HI>upon the whole,</HI> than in
any one edition before extant. As to the <HI>beauty</HI> of
<HI>type</HI> and <HI>pre&s;s-work,</HI> it is too obvious to need vindi|cation.
The accuracy of the <HI>latter</HI> almo&s;t exceeds
what was ever found in any other book. Then as
to the <HI>fronti&s;piece,</HI> it is, I think, much &s;uperior to
&s;uch as <HI>ordinarily</HI> occur; the <HI>&s;ubject</HI> animated, and
well-cho&s;en; and the <HI>execution</HI> very commendable: at
lea&s;t if we allow for the <HI>nice</HI> touches which it requir|ed,
and the <HI>uncommon difficulty</HI> of getting any thing
of this kind done to one's direction.</P>
<P>MR. Walpole is a lively and ingenious writer;
not always accurate in his determinations, and much
le&s;s &s;o in his language; too often led away by a de|&s;ire
of routing prejudices and de&s;troying giants: and
yet there is no province wherein he appears to more
advantage, in <HI>general,</HI> than in throwing new light
upon Characters in Briti&s;h Hi&s;tory. I wi&s;h he would
compo&s;e a regular work, making this his principal
point. He has, with great labour, in his Book of
Painters, recorded matters of little importance, rela|tive
to people that were of le&s;s. I have a right to
be &s;evere, for his volumes co&s;t me above thirty &s;hil|lings;
yet, where he drops the <HI>antiquarian</HI> in them,
his remarks are &s;triking, and worth peru&s;al.&mdash;I have
&s;ent for &startq;Ge&s;ner's Rural Poems,&endq; and intend to &s;ee
<PB N="339" REF="348">
&startq;The Death of Abel;&endq; though I expect to find
&s;mall plea&s;ure in this <HI>poetical pro&s;e,</HI> unle&s;s exqui&s;itely
well-tuned.&mdash;Thank you for the anecdote of Lord
Courteney: a thou&s;and &s;uch &s;ort of things, that en|gage
the public attention, are never capable of pene|trating
the depth of my retirement.</P>
<P>MR. Melmoth you will probably &s;ee often, as he
intends to make Bath his place of re&s;idence. The
<HI>Omphale</HI> you &s;ent me is a mo&s;t excellent figure, and I
&s;hall wi&s;h much to get a good ca&s;t of it; at lea&s;t,
when I am able to afford it.&mdash;When I write again,
I will give you the be&s;t account I can of <HI>my &s;hare</HI> in
Dod&s;ley's new Fables; though it will be no ea&s;y mat|ter
to &s;peak <HI>&s;eparately</HI> of it with any preci&s;ion.</P>

are many others whom I would di&s;tingui&s;h, if my

tally exactly with my own opinion: at lea&s;t, allowing

too long <HI>already</HI>&mdash;till many of the compo&s;i|tions
will not appear to the &s;ame advantage as be|fore,
and till I have not half the power that I had
formerly to improve them. When I am low-&s;pirit|ed,
I almo&s;t &s;hudder at this tremendous contract with
the publick; when my &s;pirits are elevated, I &s;ee the
nece&s;&s;ity that you do, of not lo&s;ing a moment's time&mdash;were
you here a week, you would put the matter
upon a footing that was unalterable&mdash;would to God
you <HI>were</HI> here, or any one <HI>like</HI> you! however, it is
probable you will <HI>&s;oon</HI> hear from me again upon this
very &s;ubject&mdash;I <HI>know</HI> this, that, <HI>if</HI> I print at <HI>all,</HI> the
&s;ub&s;cription is by no means to be neglected this pre|&s;ent
winter.&mdash;I have &s;een our friend Dr. Charleton
many times this &s;ea&s;on; at The Lea&s;owes; at Mr.
Knight's; at his own hou&s;e; and at my Lord Foley's.
<PB N="342" REF="351">
This vi&s;it to my Lord Foley's was performed about
three weeks ago. I went with young Knight; and
the company of the Doctor and Sir Francis Charleton
took off all re&s;traint, and made the vi&s;it perfectly
agreeable. My Lord's behaviour was entirely free
and ho&s;pitable; and his conver&s;ation lively and en|tertaining&mdash;I
mu&s;t confe&s;s, far beyond the idea which
I have been taught to conceive of him. His table
the mo&s;t magnificent, I believe, of any Nobleman's
for thirty miles round. His park, and Woobery-hill
adjacent, afford views that are either exten&s;ive, wild,
beautiful; or grand. The portico before his lodge
de&s;erves particular notice. His hou&s;e large, and com|modious,
and well furni&s;hed; but &s;carce any of the
rooms <HI>high</HI> enough to &s;tand the te&s;t of modern criti|ci&s;m.
But what &s;trikes more than all the re&s;t, is the
magnificence of his chapel&mdash;which however I cannot
&s;tay to de&s;cribe; for I this very <HI>moment</HI> receive your
letter.&mdash;After having written &s;o much before, I can
only touch upon &s;ome few particulars.&mdash;I believe,
my &s;cheme of publication will proceed in a little
time, and that you will &s;oon hear from me again.&mdash;If
you can po&s;&s;ibly excu&s;e me to Mr. Davenport, and
keep me well with him for a week or fortnight, I
will not fail to write him a re&s;pectful letter.&mdash;I am
truly a&s;hamed of my neglect; but have written more
letters within this week than I have done for a quar|ter
of a year before.&mdash;That there is a faction forming
again&s;t Lord B&mdash;, I readily believe. The war may

there is a very material difference; which it would

<P>A THOUSAND thanks to you for the very
obliging and humorous Poem which you are &s;o
kind to &s;end me. I really think it very ingenious,
and, upon the whole, extremely correct; although I
have taken the liberty of propo&s;ing one or two hints
for farther improvement. The relation that it bears
to me and my place <HI>may</HI> tend to prejudice my <HI>judge|ment;</HI>
but I cannot conceive that it requires aught
be&s;ide <HI>impartiality,</HI> to reli&s;h the beauties of this Poem.
I beg I may receive a fair copy in your own hand,
as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible; and I will con&s;ider, in the mean
time, how to &s;hew it to the publick in the mod ad|vantageous
manner. It certainly does me <HI>honour:</HI>
as things are at pre&s;ent circum&s;tanced, it may <HI>tend</HI> to
do me <HI>good;</HI> which I am very &s;ure you would be
glad to &s;ee. I am a little a&s;hamed to be &s;o much
behind-hand with you, in favours of <HI>this</HI> and <HI>other</HI>
kinds: but I live in hopes there may come a day,
when I &s;hall find occa&s;ion to expre&s;s my gratitude.
The pictures you &s;ent arrived &s;afe on Thur&s;day: and
have been &s;ince cleaned, and put up in their places.
I cannot enter upon this &s;ubject now; finding it al|mo&s;t
&s;ix o'clock at night, and having ju&s;t received a
letter from Mr. Dod&s;ley which he requires me to an|&s;wer
by return of po&s;t. It relates to the <HI>&s;cheme</HI> men|tioned
in his la&s;t, which is intended for my emolu|ment;

but which I mu&s;t not expect to &s;ucceed, with|out
con&s;iderable mortification. This <HI>inter nos.</HI>&mdash;You

<HI>Edge-hill,</HI> at your lei&s;ure. It is po&s;&s;ible that, in order
to keep clear of flattery, I have &s;aid le&s;s in its fa|vour

<HEAD>CIX. TO SHERRINGTON DAVENPORT, E&s;&abque;</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE>
The Lea&s;owes,
<DATE>Jan. 4, 1763.</DATE></OPENER>
<P>MR. G&mdash;tells me, that you have done me the
honour to lay &s;ome &s;tre&s;s upon receiving a let|ter
from me. Alas! it mu&s;t be owing purely to your
benevolence, which makes you wi&s;h to hear of an
ab&s;ent friend, and not to any expectations you can
rea&s;onably form of entertainment from his pen. The
long letter with which you favoured me was &s;o very
lively as well as ingenious, that I de&s;paired of draw|ing
<PB N="346" REF="355">
from my fountains the vivacity you do from the
Bath waters. But, be this as it will, the vein of
friend&s;hip that runs through your letter demands
my ample&s;t acknowledgements; and if you will ac|cept
of <HI>&s;uch</HI> returns, I promi&s;e they will be as <HI>hearty</HI>
as they are <HI>in&s;ipid.</HI></P>
<P>I AGREE with you, that the fir&s;t &s;allies of imagina|tion
will generally prove the mo&s;t &s;prightly, and
that they will often comprehend the principal fea|tures
of a &s;ubject. They are of the nature of dead-colouring
in a portrait; which one &s;ometimes thinks
more &s;pirtted than the &s;ame performance when fini&s;h|ed.
And yet a <HI>good</HI> painter will not <HI>hurt</HI> a portrait
by the &s;ub&s;equent labour he be&s;tows upon it, nor
will a <HI>good</HI> writer injure his piece by the pains he
takes to round and perfect it. It mu&s;t be &s;ome de|fect
in the ta&s;te of either that makes his diligence
detrimental, or gives occa&s;ion for a &s;tander-by to cry
out, &startq;Manum de tabula.&endq; I believe it will appear
upon examination, that works which co&s;t mo&s;t labour
have generally been thought the <HI>ea&s;ie&s;t</HI> and plea&s;ed
the <HI>longe&s;t.</HI> One cannot, however, deny that there
is a &s;ort of per&s;ons formed by nature for <HI>&s;hooting-fly|ing</HI>
(which, by the way, I could never <HI>do),</HI> and that
their &s;allies of imagination are what they can hardly
improve by any future pains. The&s;e may be called
men of wit and fire, but it is the union of <HI>ta&s;te</HI> with
the&s;e that con&s;titutes fine writing. True ta&s;te will
<PB N="347" REF="356">
never &s;tiffen or over-charge any performance: it will
rather be employed to &s;mooth, &s;implify, and give that
ea&s;e on which <HI>grace</HI> depends. One can as little de|ny
that there are <HI>kinds</HI> of writing which have a bet|ter
chance than others to &s;ucceed without much la|bour,
which &s;tart forth mature at <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> as Pallas did
from the brain of Jupiter. Works of <HI>humour</HI> are of|ten
of this &s;ort; and there are many in&s;tances in But|ler's
Hudibras. Yet I think the humour of <HI>Swift</HI>
was greatly owing to a judicious <HI>revi&s;al.</HI>&mdash;Pardon
me, my dear friend, for this tedious di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, which
you little thought of bringing upon your&s;elf by the
obliging hint you gave concerning tho&s;e ver&s;es upon
Venus. I do acknowledge that an additional &s;tanza
there, containing a reflexion on Chine&s;e architecture,
were better laid a&s;ide. It &s;eemed to me one of the
&startq;&s;plendida peccata,&endq; that might be a little <HI>popular</HI>
at this <HI>time;</HI> and has, therefore, for this &s;ea&s;on, ap|peared
on a board by the &s;ide of the Venus. We,
who cannot erect fre&s;h temples, or even add a new
garden-&s;eat every &s;pring, are obliged to make the
mo&s;t we can of a new and tolerable copy of ver&s;es,
that co&s;ts us <HI>thought</HI> in&s;tead of <HI>money;</HI> and even at a
pinch to piece out a dull &s;cene with duller poetry:
how el&s;e could I keep my place in countenance, &s;o
near the pompous piles of Hagley? And yet there
are few <HI>fa&s;hionable</HI> vi&s;itants that do not &s;hew an <HI>af|fection</HI>
for the little Amoret, as much as they admire
the &s;lately Sachari&s;&s;a&mdash;&startq;plerumque gratae <HI>divitibus

of palaces yet e&s;teem a root-hou&s;e or a
cottage
as a de&s;ireable object in their gardens.&mdash;Is it not
from
having experienced the imperfection of happine&s;s in
higher life, that they are led to <HI>conceive</HI> it more
com|pleat
beneath a roof of &s;traw; where, perhaps, it
may really be as defective as in the apartments of a
King or a Mini&s;ter?&mdash;A thou&s;and thanks to you and
Mrs. Davenport $or the accommodations you &s;o kind|ly
offer me. Experience will no more &s;uffer me
to
que&s;tion the <HI>cordiality</HI> than the politene&s;s of
your re|ception.
What an amu&s;ing picture have you given
of Bath! plea&s;ures carried to the utmo&s;t height,
and
opiates ready when one is cloyed with plea&s;ures!
And yet let me confe&s;s a truth, you have <HI>lightly</HI>
touched upon tho&s;e <HI>very</HI> articles which would
prove
to me the mo&s;t <HI>&s;pecifically</HI> plea&s;ing. For can
any
temptation be &s;tronger, than to &s;ay that <HI>you</HI>
re&s;ide
there? and does not my friend G&mdash;re&s;ide at Claver|ton,
of who&s;e genius and friend&s;hip I have had
proofs
the&s;e twenty years pa&s;t? and have you not Mr.
Webb, and now Mr. Melmoth, to make Bath <HI>envia|$$e</HI>
for the re&s;idence of literature? What a joy would
it afford me to go on a party with you to Percefield,
whither Mr. and Mrs. Morrice gave me the mo&s;t
pre&s;&s;ing invitations!&mdash;The&s;e &s;urely are plea&s;ures of
which&mdash;I <HI>hope</HI> one day to partake.</P>
<P><PB N="349" REF="358">
MY health, generally bad in winter and &s;pring,
has hitherto been tolerable. The <HI>influenza</HI> of la&s;t
&s;pring continued to depre&s;s me half the &s;ummer.
Would you think the ver&s;es I inclo&s;ed were written
on that occa&s;ion by a young journeyman &s;hoe-maker:
and one that lives at the village of Rowley, near
me? He con&s;idered my di&s;order in &s;omewhat too
<HI>grave</HI> a light, as I did not think my life endangered
by it; but, allowing for this, and the <HI>partiality</HI> he
&s;hews <HI>me,</HI> you will think the lines pretty extraordinary
for one of <HI>his occupation.</HI> They are not, however,
the <HI>only,</HI> or, perhaps, the <HI>chief</HI> &s;pecimens of his ge|nius;
and yet, before he came tome, his principal
knowledge was drawn from <HI>Magazines.</HI> For the&s;e:
two or three years pa&s;t, I have lent him Cla&s;&s;ics, and
other books in Engli&s;h. You &s;ee, to <HI>him,</HI> I am a
great Maecenas; although you and my friend expect
me to become an author by &s;ub&s;cription. On this
head I will &s;ay no more at <HI>pre&s;ent,</HI> than that I am
infinitely obliged by your extreme friendly offers.
My friend G&mdash;, who knows my &s;entiments, has &s;ome|times

<P>MY la&s;t letter mull have been confused, and the
arrival of it, I fear, uncertain.</P>
<P>THE hare and birds, in one of the pictures which
you &s;ent me, I think, are well; the other parts of
it indifferent; the greyhound wor&s;t of all. The
portrait is by no means equal to its companion, ei|ther
in beauty of the per&s;on, or &s;kill of the painter;
yet it matches &s;o well with the other, that I find
my parlour very much embelli&s;hed by it. Pardon
the freedom with which I critici&s;e your pre&s;ent; and

<P>I AM truly glad to find &s;o worthy a Nobleman,

<P>I HAVE heard nothing &s;ince I wrote la&s;t in regard

I have &s;uch a tribe of humours and peculiarities, that
