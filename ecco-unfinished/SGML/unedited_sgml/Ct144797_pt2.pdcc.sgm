<P>THE different and almo&s;t directly oppo&s;ite derivations of the name of this river, that have been offered by the learned, afford ano|ther &s;triking proof of the general uncertainty of etymology. It has
<PB N="2" REF="5">
been derived by Baxter from a Briti&s;h word, &s;ignifying "the extended river<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Vide Glo&s;&s;arium Antiq. Brit. I. Baxter in verbo.</NOTE>;" while Skinner, on the other hand, deduces it from a Cambro-Briti&s;h epithet rendered by "pent in<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">See Skinner in verbo.</NOTE>." Though the improbability of this la&s;t conjecture is evident, on the fir&s;t &s;ight of its wide and exten&s;ive bed, yet has it the &s;anction al&s;o of Cambden's authority, whom Somner &s;u&s;pects to have mi&s;taken the &s;en&s;e of the Briti&s;h word,
<PB N="3" REF="6">
to which he refers it, and to have confounded it with a Saxon one, which greatly re&s;embles it in &s;ound<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot"><P>Tine, fluvius, hodi&egrave;que &s;ic dictus in Agro Northumbren&s;i:&mdash;So called, &s;aith Cambden, if we may believe the Britons, for that by rea&s;on of his narrow banks he is &s;trait pent in; for &s;o &s;ignifieth tin, as they &s;ay, in the Briti&s;h tongue, &s;o be.&mdash; For Britons and Briti&s;h, he &s;hould haply have rather &s;aid Saxons and Saxonic, the word being of that &s;ignification with the&s;e (as may be &s;een in Tinan), but not in tho&s;e."&mdash;Somner, Saxon Dict. in verbo.</P>
<P>Bullet, in his Memoires &s;ur la Langue Celtique, tom. i, p. 346, derives the name of our river from a Celtic word, &s;ignifying <HI>double,</HI> i. e. a river formed of two rivers.

On a &eacute;tendu par abus le nom de Tine &agrave; chacu$e des rivieres qui la forment."</P></NOTE>.</P>
<P>The opinion that the names of our rivers are of Saxon origin, has been lately controverted by the author of the Hi&s;tory of Manche&s;ter, who a&s;&s;erts, with great plau&s;ibility of argument, that mo&s;t of them are Briti&s;h, and the &s;ame now as when fir&s;t impo&s;ed<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">"Few of the Briti&s;h names," &s;ays he, "have de&s;cended to us&mdash;The appellations of our places have been all lo&s;t, but tho&s;e of our rivers are generally pre&s;erved; the former are confined to a &s;mall extent of region, and known only to a few; but rivers flow through a length of country, and communicate their names and waters to different di&s;tricts and various a&s;&s;ociations of men; while tho&s;e, therefore, are ea&s;ily lo&s;t, the&s;e are pretty faithfully retained;&mdash; &s;uch are the Avons, the Cams, the Tynes, &amp;c." He adds, "I have previou&s;ly &s;hewn the word Avon to have been frequently contracted into A$n, An, or Un, and as D'Avon and T'Avon are both the &s;ame with it, &s;o are they contracted in the &s;ame manner; the latter is reduced into Tayne, the name of a frith in Scotland; into Taune or Tone, that of a river in Somer&s;et&s;hire; and into Teyne, that of a current in Stafford&s;hire, &amp;c."</NOTE>.</P>
<P>No literary monuments have been tran&s;mitted to inform us with certainty by what name this river was di&s;tingui&s;hed while the Roman legions were &s;tationed on its banks.</P>
<P>It occurs not as a river of Northumberland in Ptolomy's ancient map of Britain; if it was not then called the Vedra, which is the name of a river marked in it, about the place where that of Tyne ought to be found<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot"><P>Ptolomy is generally thought to have written under Trojan, who began his reign A. D. 99; Hadrian, and Antoninus Pius, who ended his in the year 162. His numerous and manife&s;t errors are very di&s;couraging; the learned and candid Baron Clerk &s;aid he always con&s;idered Ptolomy among&s;t the mo&s;t incorrect of all ancient authors. Several things, however, as Hor&s;ley has ob&s;erved, might ju&s;tly be pleaded to excu&s;e his inac|curacies, and great allowances mu&s;t be made for the time in which he wrote. This mu&s;t apologize for his omi&s;&s;ion of the Tine, and of Newca&s;tle under any name, "for," adds the &s;ame ingenious writer "unle&s;s Vedra mean the Tine, and O&s;tia Vedrae, the Roman &s;tation and town at the mouth of this river, near South-Sheilds, they are namele&s;s in this Geographer."</P>

<P>The following is a ju&s;t and accurate de&s;cription of the river Tyne:</P>
<P>"The river Tyne ri&s;es from different &s;ources; &s;ome of them about &s;ixty miles to the north-we&s;t, and others about fifty to the we&s;t and &s;outh-we&s;t from Newca&s;tle, and from thence to its entrance into the &s;ea at Tynemouth is about ten miles; but if we mea&s;ure by the windings of the river, it will be more in both ca&s;es.&mdash;The channel betwixt New|ca&s;tle and Tynemouth is of a very different width and depth, &s;o that the tide is more rapid in &s;ome places than in others. The entrance into the harbour at the low lights is very narrow; but the channel forms into a fine large ba&s;on for the whole length of Sheilds, capable of holdin$ above two thou&s;and &s;ail of large &s;hips. Above which, the tide &s;pread$ over the exten&s;ive &s;lats of Jarrow-Slake; and then, for a great length &s;ome a remarkably fine broad and deep pool called the Long-Reach, all which contain an immen&s;e quantity of water. After this the tide is ob&s;tructed by &s;everal windings and narrow places in the channel, till it comes within about a mile of Newca&s;tle, where it runs in an open and wider pool, till it flows about two miles above the town, when it is a good deal intercepted in its cour&s;e by a large i&s;land, con&s;i&s;ting of many acres, called the King's Meadows; after flowing round this i&s;land by two narrow channels, and through &s;everal beautiful windings, it ri&s;es a little above the village of Newburn; in all about &s;even or eight miles above New|ca&s;tle.</P>
<P>"The tides commonly flow about four hours and a half, and ebb about &s;even hours and a half at Newca&s;tle bridge: and the perpendicular ri&s;e of the river here in a &s;pring tide will &s;ometimes be about eleven or twelve feet, and at Tynemouth bar about eighteen feet: but both the&s;e circum&s;tances vary greatly from the different winds, and the different quan|tities of fre&s;h water in the river: in a north-we&s;terly wind they will &s;ometimes ri&s;e three feet higher than is mentioned above; and in a &s;outh-we&s;terly one, &s;ometimes &s;carcely half &s;o high: and in &s;ome of our great land floods, the tide has not &s;ufficient forces to &s;tem and turn the current, which will &s;et downwards during the whole &s;well of the tide."</P>

<P>It appears, by an inqui&s;ition taken at Newca&s;tle upon Tyne on the Tue&s;day in Ea&s;ter week, 1417, that anciently all tho&s;e fi&s;hermen that went out to fi&s;h at &s;ea from that port, were accu&s;tomed to live in a &s;treet a&s;&s;igned to them in that town, called Fi&s;her-Gate, to prevent the regrating of the fi&s;h before they were brought up to that town, and had paid the king his cu&s;toms and prizes.&mdash;Murray MS. p. 235.</P>
<P>By another inqui&s;ition taken at the &s;ame town on the Thur&s;day following, it appears that complaints had been exhibited again&s;t the priors of Durham and Tinmouth; as al&s;o again&s;t the abbot of Newmin&s;ter, for making wears in the river Tyne, which en|croached on the deep cour&s;e of the water, that is the king's &s;tream, called the channel and middleway, and for having nets of &s;uch &s;mall &s;ize as to de&s;troy the brood of &s;almon and other fi&s;hes.&mdash;Ibid. p. 211.</P></NOTE>.</P>

<P>The proper di&s;po&s;al of the gravel, &amp;c. brought for the purpo&s;e of balla&s;ting the empty &s;hips that traded hither for coal, appears at this early period to have been an object of con|cern to the corporation of Newca&s;tle, without who&s;e intervention it is not improbable but that the bed of the Tyne had been choked up long ago with this adventitious matter and one of the mo&s;t important of our rivers by that means rendered unnavigable. The mayor and burge&s;&s;es of Newca&s;tle, it &s;hould &s;eem, were at this time fir&s;t inve&s;ted with the power of depo&s;iting this balla&s;t where there would be the lea&s;t danger of its falling into and damaging their river, although in &s;everal conte&s;ts concerning this power they have been de&s;irous of claiming it by pre&s;cription as con&s;ervators of the Tyne, &s;trengthened by an ad|ditional authority derived to them from the &s;tatute 34 Hen. VIII. cap. 9.</P>
<P>From the circum&s;tance of this being the fir&s;t mention that occurs of balla&s;t-&s;hores, it &s;eems probable that the coal trade was now fir&s;t beginning to be of con&s;iderable con&s;e|quence. In a cour&s;e of years and great increa&s;e of commerce, the&s;e balla&s;t-&s;hores have crowded the banks of the Tyne on both &s;ides with artificial mountains.</P>
<P>Bourne tells us that a place below Sand-Gate, where there is at pre&s;ent a great ropery, was the fir&s;t balla&s;t-&s;hore out of the town, the &s;ite of which, as al&s;o of the burying-ground, which &s;till retains the name of Balla&s;t-Hills, a little lower down the river, had been pur|cha&s;ed by the corporation of Newca&s;tle of the Lords of Biker, for that and other purpo&s;es.</P></NOTE>.</P>

Un&s;atisfied with the fir&s;t, he appears to have made a &s;econd voyage thither, &s;oon after his return to Britain, and was to have been accompanied in it by Alchfrid, the king's &s;on, if that pious prince had not been prevented by his father's expre&s;s injunctions to the contrary. Afterwards having taken the ton&s;ure, he was two years a monk in the i&s;le of St. Honorat, in France, and going a third time to Rome, was deputed from thence, by Pope Vitalian, in company with Theodore and Adrian, two di&s;tingui&s;hed eccle&s;ia&s;ties, emi|nent for both &s;acred and profane learning, as a mi&s;&s;ionary into Britain.</P>

Leland, on I know not what authority, has a&s;&s;erted, that Theodore, Archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, founded the mona&s;tery of St. Peter, at the mouth of the Were, and al&s;o this at Jarrow, in honour of St. Paul.&mdash;Collectanea, vol. iv. tom. iii. p. 70.</P></NOTE>, a Saxon monk, of great eminence in his time, who having been a &s;oldier in his earlier youth,

The windows were glazed by arti&s;ts brought from France. He added to his mona&s;tery an ample library, which he &s;tored with Greek and Latin volumes, imported by him&s;elf from Italy.

<P>It is ob&s;ervable in the in&s;cription on this bell (&s;ee plate of Mi&s;cellaneous Antiquities, N^o 8.), which is plainly to be under&s;tood "SANCTE PAULE ORA PRO NOBIS," that the A in ORA, the R in PRO, and the N in NOBIS, have, probably through the ignorance of the founder, been turned up&s;ide down in the mould. To the &s;ame cau&s;e may be attributed the tran&s;po&s;ition of &s;ome of the letters; the V after the L in PALUS, ought to precede it; and the S that follows, be taken to the end of the word NOBIS, where, in&s;tead of that letter, there is an E turned up&s;ide down, which ought to follow the L, and make the word "Paule," in the vocative ca&s;e, to agree with "Sancte."

<P>NOTWITHSTANDING what has been advanced to the contrary by the learned Hor&s;ley, &s;ome recent di&s;coveries &s;eem clearly to prove to us, that the Romans had a &s;tation in this place during their re&s;i|dence in Britain<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot"><P>See Mi&s;cellaneous Antiquities (plate of) No. 11, 12, 13, 14.&mdash;No. 11 is an exact repre&s;entation of the front of a Roman altar found in Tinmouth Ca&s;tle in Northumber|land, by Major Durnford, at the depth of &s;ix feet in the earth, where it had been laid as a foundation &s;tone, probably of the ancient Chri&s;tian church, which is &s;aid to have been erected there &s;oon after the introduction of that faith into Britain. The lower part of it, by whatever accident, is much defaced, and it is at pre&s;ent quite flat at the top, though we may &s;uppo&s;e it to have had originally a focus there, which the workmen, in order to make it &s;quare and bed properly, may have been obliged to take off. The in&s;cription is plainly to be read: "Jovi optimo maximo Aelius Rufus Praefectus Cohortis quartae Lin|gonum." The Lingones were a people of Champagne in France, and are well known to have been among the Roman auxiliary troops of infantry, but this is our fir&s;t informa|tion where the fourth cohort of them was &s;tationed in Britain.</P>
<P>No. 12, repre&s;ents a &s;tone nearly &s;quare, one foot nine inches by one foot ten, which was found al&s;o in the &s;ame place, June 12, 1783, where it had been laid in the foundation of &s;ome of the ancient buildings.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t letter of what I call the fir&s;t line of the in&s;cription, is confe&s;&s;edly faint and doubtful: the &s;econd letter appears plainly to be a Y, as does the third to be an R, though at fir&s;t &s;ight it re&s;embles a P. There can be no doubt concerning any of the others. Whether or not the &s;tone, which I take to have been a tablet on a temple erected there to &s;ome god of the winds, has undergone any alterations, when it was wrought up in the Chri&s;tian &s;tructure, I am not able to a&s;certain. As there are none but the mo&s;t u&s;ual contractions in the other lines, I was induced to think there was none in the fir&s;t, and therefore read the whole:
<Q><L>Gyrum, Cumbas, et Templum &s;ecit Caius Julius Verus</L>
<L>Maximinus Legionis &s;extae victricis ex voto.</L></Q>
I &s;uppo&s;e Gyrum to mean here "a circular harbour for the &s;hipping," and, in favour of this hypothe&s;is, have to ob&s;erve that there is &s;till a rece&s;s of that form, called Prior's Haven, adjoining on the &s;outh to Tinmouth Ca&s;tle, which has every appearance of hav|ing been one of the artificial harbours of that great people, and is, I pre&s;ume, the place alluded to in the in&s;cription.</P>
<P>Scheffer, in his Book de Militia Navali Veterum, p. 212, cites Columella, lib. ix. as de&s;cribing the ancient mode of making harbours in the following words: "praejaciuntur in Gyrum moles."</P>
<P>This word &s;eems to have been corrupted afterwards into "Gyrrus," in the ba&s;e Latinity: &s;ee Dufre&s;ne in verbo, where he gives us a quotation from an authority of the date of A. D. 1064, in which the following pa&s;&s;age occurs: "Eant et redeant pi&s;catores Gyr|rum." If this does not mean that "The fi&s;hermen &s;hall have ingre&s;s and regre&s;s to and from the harbour," I fear it will be difficult to point out its &s;ignification.</P>
<P>Scheffer abovecited, p. 71, &s;peaking of the word "Cumba" being frequently u&s;ed for "Cymba" tells us: "Cumbam nominat quam &s;upra Cymbam diximus, u&s;itata Latinis &s;cribendi con&s;uetudine, qua U Graecorum in U &s;uum vertunt."</P>
<P>"Fecit" is with the &s;tricte&s;t propriety u&s;ed here to &s;ignify "making" a harbour, "building" &s;hips or barges, and "erecting" a temple.</P>
<P>If this Maximinus be the per&s;on who was afterwards made emperor, this in&s;cription may be dated &s;ome little time before A. D. 235.</P>
<P>No. 13 and 14 give &s;ide views of the altar: on one of which the pre&s;ericulum, &s;ecuris, &s;ece&s;pita and bullock's head, all of rude de&s;ign and execution, are common ornaments; but the &s;nakes, one on each &s;ide of the patera, on the other, appear &s;ingular.</P></NOTE>.</P>

<P>Mr. Camden &s;ays, that he will not gain&s;ay this opinion, but he dares confidently affirm that this place in the time of the Romans was called Tunacellum, which &s;ignifies as much as the promontory of Tuna, or Tina, where the fir&s;t cohort called Aelia Cla&s;&s;ica, be|cau&s;e it was fir&s;t rai&s;ed by the Emperor Hadrian, who&s;e family name was Aelius, was in pay for &s;ea &s;ervice; for the Romans had their naves lu&s;oriae, or light frigates, in their border rivers, both for the &s;uppre&s;&s;ing of the excur&s;ions of the neighbouring enemy, and the making of incur&s;ions upon them, as may be &s;een in the Codex Theodo&s;ii, under the title "De Lu&s;oriis Danubii," <HI>i. e.</HI> light ve&s;&s;els on the Danube.</P>
<P>Under the Saxon Heptarchy this place was called Tunace&s;ter, not, as Bede affirms, from the Abbot Tunna, a mere romantic &s;tory, which if we recommend to the reader, it mu&s;t be only for his diver&s;ion, and not for any truth in it, but from its &s;ituation on the mouth of the river Tine.

This being told to the abbot, he &s;oon concluded that there mu&s;t needs have been &s;ome treachery in his own hou&s;e, and, &s;ifting into the matter, the fraud was detected, and the manager of the &s;ame convicted; whereupon he was &s;ent away to the cell of Thinemue, there to do perpetual penance for his crime.

<P>"On the death of John, abbot of St. Albans, A. D. 1214, William Trumpinton was elected to that abbacy. After the death of King John, he vi&s;ited Thynemue, and other cells. When the abbot goes to Thynemue, he is to be attended by &s;ix e&s;quires, who to this effect have extraordinary feofs of the land of the church. The&s;e &s;ix are at the abbot's charge, both going and coming; but upon their own hor&s;es, the which to be &s;ightly and &s;trong enough to carry, according to cu&s;tom, if need be, the habits of a monk behind each &s;quire. If any hor&s;e belonging to any of the&s;e &s;quires &s;hall happen to die by the way, the abbot is to give him ten &s;hillings for his lo&s;s. It is to be ob&s;erved that the abbot is to a&s;k the king's licence to go to &s;uch remote parts of the kingdom, and &s;o near to Scotland, when&s;oever he de&s;igns to repair to Thynmue. When arrived there, he is to behave him&s;elf mode&s;tly, correcting the family, not to be a tyrant, not &s;quandering the provi&s;ions and &s;tores of the hou&s;e; but con&s;idering he is come thither to reform all that requires it, and to vi&s;it his flock with fatherly affection. This abbot pro|ceeded to Thynemue, attended by &s;uch a multitude as looked like an army. There he reformed what was ami&s;s, and was de&s;ired by the prior to di&s;charge him of that office, becau&s;e he was grown old. The old prior of Thynemue with much difficulty obtained leave to quit that dignity, and was all the re&s;t of his life kept by the abbot as his coun|&s;ellor, and at his table."

vi&s;ited Tinmouth, and the other cells of that mona&s;tery. The mode of his vi&s;itation of this place was as follows: he had &s;ix e&s;quires to ac|company him, who were on that account well enfeoffed with lands of that church. The&s;e e&s;quires travelled on their own hor&s;es, but were &s;upported at the abbot's expencc; the&s;e hor&s;es were to be good ones, each able to carry an e&s;quire, and, if need required, a monk's clothes behind him; and for every one of them that &s;hould happen to die on the journey, the abbot was to allow ten &s;hillings. It appears on this occa&s;ion that the abbot was not permitted to vi&s;it the&s;e remote parts, bordering on the kingdom of Scotland, without a &s;pecial licence from the King.</P>

<P>The following occurs in the London Gazette: "War-Office, February 27th, 1779. Colonel Spencer Cowper, lieutenant-governor of Tinmouth Ca&s;tle."</P>
<P>I made the &s;ub&s;equent ob&s;ervations on a vi&s;it to the remains of this place, June 20th, 1780.</P>
<P>In the ruins of Tinmouth mona&s;tery there are &s;till ob&s;ervable three rece&s;&s;es in the &s;outh wall, near the entrance to the oratory of St. Mary; one is &s;aid to have been the confe&s;&s;ional chair, divided by a &s;tone partition, where there has been anciently a grate.&mdash;Another of them has evidently been the cavity for containing the holy water, and the third the clo&s;et for the con&s;ecrated ho&s;t.&mdash;It is remarkable that the capitals of the columns have each of them a different kind of ornament.</P>
<P>The oratory of St. Mary has been cleaned out by order of the governor, and &s;hut up to pre&s;erve it from future de&s;ecrations.</P>
<P>On the out&s;ide of this oratory, are cut in a &s;ort of blue &s;tone, different from the re&s;t, now almo&s;t defaced by time and the fret of the &s;ea, the arms of Tinmouth priory, viz. gules, three crowns or: tho&s;e of the abbey of St. Albans, <HI>i. e.</HI> azure, a cro&s;s &s;altire or, as u&s;ed at pre&s;ent by the borough of St. Albans; and in the middle the common Greek abbreviation of the name of Je&s;us, erroneou&s;ly interpreted Je&s;us hominum &s;alvator&mdash; for it con&s;i&s;ts of a Greek $ota, ep&s;ilon and &s;igma.&mdash;The arms of Tinmouth priory were originally tho&s;e of O&s;win, King of Northumberland.&mdash;See Mi&s;cellaneous Antiquities, (plate of,) No. 1.</P>
<P>Among the ruins in the we&s;t part of the church, is a pillar of the very rude&s;t Saxon architecture, which has probably been a part of the original building. On the &s;outh &s;ide of the grand entrance to the church is a Saxon arch with a Gothic capital.</P>
<P>I ob&s;erved a whim&s;ical anachroni&s;m in &s;culpture on an upright &s;tone in the priory church|yard, where in the cre&s;t of the &s;hipwright's arms Noah's ark is pierced for guns, and has a quarter-deck. "The 30th of February" occurs on a grave-&s;tone. In an in&s;cription on a &s;tone covering the remains of a child of five years of age, the infant (for want of proper pointing) is plainly made to have a wife and child. A per&s;on of the &s;ame name with Baronet Liddell has taken the arms of that family upon his tomb-&s;tone, forgetting to omit the hand, gules, of Ul&s;ter.&mdash;The following quaint in&s;cription occurs, ibid.</P>

<P>On a curious oar, that belonged to the admiralty court of the town of Newca&s;tle upon Tyne, and which is &s;till pre&s;erved in the archives of the corporation, the arms of that town are painted after the direction of the above grant, without a motto&mdash;The date, "A^o. DNI 1606."</P>

<P>I am indebted for the &s;ub&s;equent very intere&s;ting &s;trictures on Mr. Wallis's mo&s;t erro|neous account (See his Hi&s;tory of Northumberland) of the courts of Newca&s;tle upon Tyne, to the above Nathanael Pun&s;hon, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> under &s;heriff.</P>
<P>"Mr. Wallis has been mi&s;informed in almo&s;t every in&s;tance re&s;pecting the civil government of Newca&s;tle. Speaking of the mayor's court of record, he &s;ays, "No attor|neys are allowed to plead in it, but &s;uch as are free of the corporation." By which, one would &s;uppo&s;e he means free burge&s;&s;es: if this be his meaning, he is mi&s;taken; for if an attorney be regularly admitted at We&s;tmin&s;ter, having &s;erved his clerk&s;hip to an attorney of the mayor's court, he has a right to be admitted there, whether he be a free|man or not.&mdash;He &s;ays, "It has &s;ix &s;erjeants at mace to attend it."&mdash;Now there are eight, <HI>viz.</HI> The water-bailiff, who bears the great mace, the &s;heriff's &s;erjeant, and &s;ix common &s;erjeants, who are all &s;erjeants at mace, and called &s;o in the charter.&mdash;"An action com|menced in it may be brought to trial for 30<ABBR>s.</ABBR> but will co&s;t more money and time in the &s;heriff's court, out of which an action may be removed into the mayor's at any time before a jury is &s;worn; but not of the mayor's into the &s;heriff's." Here again he is wrong; in the fir&s;t place, it is very &s;eldom that either the mayor's or &s;heriff's court takes cogni|zance of debts under 40 &s;hillings, being re&s;trained by a clau&s;e in the act of parliament (of William and Mary) e&s;tabli&s;hing the Court of Reque&s;ts, commonly called the Court of Con&s;cience, from holding pleas of &s;uch &s;mall debts, except for rent re&s;erved upon lea&s;e, and &s;ome other cau&s;es of action, which the Court of Con&s;cience does not extend to. Then with re&s;pect to the removal of cau&s;es from the &s;heriff's court to the mayor's, there never was an in&s;tance of any &s;uch removal; for no cau&s;e can be removed either from the &s;heriff's court to the mayor's, or from the mayor's to the &s;heriff's. The&s;e two courts are coeval, being in&s;tituted by the &s;ame charter (more &s;trictly &s;peaking, they may be &s;aid to be con|tinued by the &s;ame charter); they are of &s;imilar juri&s;diction and practice, and only differ in this particular, <HI>viz.</HI> that actions are brought again&s;t free burge&s;&s;es in the mayor's court, and again&s;t foreigners, or non-freemen in the &s;heriff's. "The juries of this and the &s;heriff's court are the &s;ame; they are returned every Chri&s;tmas by the &s;everal wards of the corporation, at their wardmote inque&s;t, where particular wards appoint per&s;ons to &s;erve as jurymen for every month in the year."&mdash;There is no &s;uch court as that of a ward|mote in Newca&s;tle at pre&s;ent; nor do I believe there ever was, though the town is divided into wards, and con&s;tables appointed to each.</P>
<P>"Upon a cau&s;e being removed out of the &s;heriff's court into this (the mayor's), and it appearing to the mayor that a verdict hath been obtained again&s;t the plaintiff for more than his ju&s;t debt, the mayor may remit the cau&s;e to judgment for the ju&s;t debt only." After ob&s;erving that cau&s;es are not removed, or removable, in this manner, it is needle&s;s to &s;ay that there is no &s;uch practice in Newca&s;tle.</P>
<P>With regard to the &s;heriff's court, he &s;ays, "The attorneys who plead in it are ap|pointed by the mayor and court of aldermen." There is no court of aldermen in New|ca&s;tle. The attorneys are admitted there in the &s;ame manner as in the mayor's court.</P>
<P>The fees mentioned by Mr. Wallis are very different from what are taken and al|lowed. Indeed, they were not well known, and con&s;equently different charges were often made till the 15th and 19th of June, 1767, one being the mayor's, and the other the &s;heriff's jury day, when the fees of the two courts were &s;ettled. "The defendant may (after the verdict is given, and before judgment is entered) &s;top judgment by taking the cau&s;e before the mayor, for time to pay the money recovered." There never was a$$ &s;uch practice in Newca&s;tle. "If either party cannot &s;tay in town till the day of trial, his te&s;timony in writing will be allowed for good evidence." By the word party, I &s;up|po&s;e he means the plaintiff or defendant; and if this were allowed, it would be &s;uch an inducement to perjury as never was known, or admitted in any court of law.</P>
<P>The court of guild is holden thrice a year, as Mr. Wallis ob&s;erves, but not for the purpo&s;es he mentions; the principal bu&s;ine&s;s of the guild is for the apprentices and &s;ons of freemen to petition for their freedom; they are called by the &s;tyle of the company that their ma&s;ters or fathers were of: this is what is termed "calling their guilds." And the wardens and &s;tewards of each company attend there to put a &s;top to, or prevent any per&s;on from obtaining his freedom, who, they apprehend, is not entitled to it. An apprentice$$ called thrice in guild, or rather at three different guilded $word$; the &s;on of a $word$ only once. And if an objection be made, or a &s;top put to his guild, the per&s;on making the objection is &s;ummoned before the common-council, to give his rea&s;on for &s;topping the guild. And if he &s;hew good cau&s;e for making the objection, then the per&s;on applying cannot be &s;worn a freeman till the objection be removed. But if no &s;top be put, or ob|jection made at guild, then the per&s;on applying may at any time afterwards be &s;worn a free burge&s;s before the mayor, or any other magi&s;trate. This is the principal bu&s;ine&s;s of the court, and not for turning over apprentices, or hearing differences between them and their ma&s;ters, as Mr. Wallis tells us. The oath taken by a freeman on his admi&s;&s;ion, is very different from that mentioned by Mr. Wallis. Hence it appears, that he has been &s;trangely mi&s;informed with re&s;pect to the different courts in Newca&s;tle; and as he has men|tioned &s;ome that neither do, nor ever did exi&s;t there; &s;o al&s;o he has omitted to mention one, <HI>i. e.</HI> the county court, that &s;till continues to be held."</P>
<P>In the time of the commonwealth, it appears that the magi&s;trates of Newca&s;tle upon Tyne puni&s;hed &s;colds with the branks, and drunkards by making them carry a $$b, called the drunkard's cloak, through the &s;treets of that town.

<P>"Near Luxemburg, at a &s;hort di&s;tance from the coal mines, are found con&s;iderable quan|tities of petrified wood. The Abbot de Sauvages makes mention, in the Memoirs of the French Academy for 1743, of &s;ome fragments of &s;tony wood, &s;trongly incru&s;ted up in the bark, with one or two inches of coal, in which this petrifaction was performed. It is very common to find, lying over coal mines, wood which is not entirely di&s;&s;olved; but according as it is buried to a greater depth, it is more &s;en&s;ibly altered.</P>
<P>"At Brull, near Cologn and Bonn, M. de Bury, a famous collier of Liege, by dig$$ing into a v$lley, found a &s;ort of earth coal, which was nothing el&s;e but wood, that had been covered by a mountain of earth. There are &s;everal mines wherein none can mi&s;take the trunks and branches of trees, and other remains of wood; heaps of fo&s;&s;il wood are met with at a great depth, di&s;po&s;ed by benches, and &s;eparated from one another by beds of earth, and all of them affording good rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect a pa&s;&s;ing of the ligneous nature, or a true tran&s;mutation of wood into coal. At the bottom of that chain of mountains that runs from Lyons to Stra&s;burgh, on the high road between the&s;e two cities, M. Fontaine, of the Academy of Sciences, di&s;covered one of tho&s;e &s;ubterraneous fore&s;ts, and took with him to Paris &s;everal of the pieces, collected at hazard, which Mr. Macquer and the au|thor of this treati&s;e, Mr. Morand, were commi&s;&s;ioned to examine. They found there|in two &s;ub&s;tances different from each other; the fir&s;t was real wood, which had been pre&s;erved in the earth in its natural &s;tate, &s;ome parts of a browni&s;h colour, others entirely black: the &s;econd underwent no alteration in the a&s;&s;emblage of the fibres that compo&s;e the ligneous body, in the knots they produce, in their weight and in their colour. The bark that had been con&s;umed with rottenne&s;s was replaced by a &s;andy matter that adhered &s;trongly to the wood. The&s;e pieces, who&s;e ligneous body was entire, burnt well and were converted by fire into a good and real vegetable coal.</P>
<P>"In &s;everal &s;amples portions were found, who&s;e ligneous fibres were interrupted in their continuity, and reduced into a coaly matter, which crumbled by the pre&s;&s;ure of the fingers, and blacked them as charcoal of the willow tree.</P>
<P>"There was another piece which might be called very curious by rea&s;on of the changes it underwent. The ligneous fibres were therein very perceptible as to their di&s;po&s;ition, but the whole of them had contracted a complete mineralization. All the extremities of the fibres were black, and retained the lu&s;tre of finely-poli&s;hed jet: and the whole piece was heavy, as pieces of petrified wood are known to be. The &s;econd &s;ub&s;tance was purely earthy. In &s;everal parts of Germany mines of fo&s;&s;il wood have been di&s;covered, known by the name of Holtz-kohlen. The&s;e coals are of different kind, and as much di&s;tingui&s;hed by their colour as their properties. Some authors think that tho&s;e heaps of fo&s;&s;il wood may lead to the finding of real coal, and that, if the wood-coal be not &s;uch, it is becau&s;e it does not lie deep enough in the earth, for the woods being re&s;olved to the nece&s;&s;ary degree, that con&s;titutes the &s;tone coal: but this preten&s;ion does not &s;eem to have any good grounds, if it be con&s;idered that good and true coal is often met with at a very little depth in the earth, and &s;ometimes pretty near the &s;urface. It &s;eems more natural to &s;eek the cau&s;e that has hindered this coal of fo&s;&s;il wood from becoming true coal, in the different earthy, &s;aline, or bituminous &s;ub&s;tances wherein it is found. Their nature perhaps is not fit for operating this mineralization, or even $span$ an impediment to it."

<P>"The&s;e vegetable forms, and the &s;trata containing them, are the certain indication of coal, not only in Derby&s;hire, but in every part of the kingdom which I have vi&s;ited; and I am informed that the &s;ame phenomenon holds equally true in every other part of the world yet explored. Sir A&s;hton Lever's incomparable Mu&s;eum of natural curio&s;ities contains the mo&s;t perfect &s;pecimens, and the greate&s;t variety of fo&s;&s;il vegetables, if I may be al|lowed to call them &s;o, I ever &s;aw.</P>
<P>"Now &s;ince it appears that all &s;trata accompanying coal univer&s;ally abound with vege|table forms, it &s;eems to indicate that all coals were originally derived from the vegetables thus enveloped in the &s;tone or clay."</P>
<P>"On coal, let it be ob&s;erved, that from its always pre&s;enting it&s;elf in beds of &s;tone, or clay, impre&s;&s;ed with vegetable forms, and having been met with in various &s;tages of its tran&s;mutation, from the vegetable &s;ub&s;tance to that of perfect coal, it has with rea&s;on been concluded to derive its origin from remains of vegetables."&mdash;Eternity of the World, by G.

<P>"In &s;tone too of a totally different nature from marble or lime&s;tone, vegetable impre&s;|&s;ions, and the remains of land animals, are every where obvious; and what is equally &s;ingular, coal never occurs but in the beds of matter, that are thus impre&s;&s;ed with &s;uch land ani|mals and vegetables."&mdash;Ibid. p. 30.</P>

<P>The worth &s;taith is plainly derived from the Anglo-Saxon &s;ta&wyn;e, ripa, littus, &s;tatio navium.

The waggon-way &s;hould be made into the &s;tore-hou&s;e, at &s;uch a height from the ground, as to permit the coals to run from the waggons down a &s;pout into the ve&s;&s;els; or el&s;e to fall down into the &s;tore-hou&s;e, as occa&s;ion may require. This kind of &s;tore-hou&s;e is well adapted to di&s;patch, and &s;aving expence; for a waggon-load of coals may be delivered either into the &s;tore-hou&s;e or ve&s;&s;els in&s;tantly, with very little trouble; and if the coals were expo&s;ed to the effects of the &s;un and rain, they would be greatly injured in their quality, but being lodged under cover of the &s;tore-hou&s;e, they are pre&s;erved."</P>
<P>When the waggons are emptied into a keel or ve&s;&s;el by a &s;pout, it is called a trunk &s;taith.&mdash;At Whitehaven, they are called &s;teers. When a waggon lets fall its contents down one of the&s;e &s;pouts, the noi&s;e at a di&s;tance very much re&s;embles a clap of thunder.

See Anglo-Saxon Vocabulary, Ceol, navis. On the fir&s;t arrival of the Saxons in this i&s;land, they came over in three long &s;hips, &s;tyled by them&s;elves, as Ver&s;tegan informs us, keeles. In the Chartulary of Tinmouth mona&s;tery, the &s;ervants of the prior who wrought in the barges, are called, A. D. 1378, kelers, an appellation plainly &s;ynonimous with our pre&s;ent keelmen.</P>
<P>In the olde&s;t books of the Ho&s;tmen's company, keelmen are mentioned, A. D. 1600. Their ve&s;&s;els are called keels or lightners. The chief per&s;on on board the keel is called the &s;kipper. Vox compo&s;ita ex &s;cip, navis, et wer, vir; euphonice &s;kipper, Gramm. Angl. Sax. c. 3, reg. 20. The cabin of the keel is called the huddock;&mdash;this is probably a diminutive from hutte, cabin, as paddock from padde, a toad, hillock from hill, &amp;c. See Sewel's Dutch Dictionary in verbo.</P>
<P>They call the great oar, u&s;ed as a kind of rudder at the &s;tern of this ve&s;&s;el, the &s;wape. Swappe, to &s;trike or fling down with violence, occurs in Chaucer.</P>
<P>The poles with which the keelmen on certain occa&s;ions navigate their ve&s;&s;els, are called puys.&mdash;Poy, appoyo, Spani&s;h. Appuy, of appuyer, French, to &s;upport, is a pole u&s;ed by rope dancers to poi&s;e them&s;elves with.</P>
<P>With the&s;e puys our keelmen pu&s;h on their keels in &s;hallow water in the following manner, when it is inconvenient to u&s;e &s;ails or oars.</P>
<P>One on each &s;ide of the ve&s;&s;el going toward the prow puts down his pole to the bottom, in a po&s;ition inclined towards the head of the keel; at the &s;ame time thru&s;ting again&s;t it forcibly with his &s;houlder, and walking down on the ga$$ was towards th$ &s;tem, as the keel moves under him; by this means the keel gains a tolerably quick and even cour&s;e on the water: having walked the whole length of the ve&s;&s;el, they pluck up the puys, re|turn ha&s;tily to the prow, put them down again, and thru&s;t $word$ before.</P>
<P>Keel-bullies is a term u&s;ed for this &s;pecies of waterme$$ bullies is al&s;o a common appellation among the people concerned in the in the coal work for brothers:&mdash;it is probably derived from the ob&s;olete adjective boo$e, beloved.&mdash;See A&s;h's Dictionary.</P>

<P>There occurs ibid. date July 28, 10 Hen. VIII. an act "that no ho&s;teman nor non other man being free of this fellow&s;hip &s;hall buy any goods of their ho&s;ts."</P>
<P>About the year 1520, among the impo&s;itions mentioned in the&s;e merchants books, "beyond the &s;ea," occur "for every two chalder of coals &frac12;.&mdash;for every chalder of grind|&s;tones &frac12;." Yet in the &s;ame books in their li&s;ts of impo&s;itions for 1603 and 1618, no men|tion occurs of coals or grind&s;tones, after the ho&s;tmen had been incorporated by royal charter. It is la&s;tly ob&s;ervable, that out of the 48 names that are found in that charter, 38 occur al&s;o about the &s;ame time in the merchants books.&mdash;See in the &s;tatute of Her|ring, 31 Ed. III. cap. 1, ho&s;telers in the port of Yarmouth, who &s;eem greatly to have re&s;embled the ho&s;tmen in the coal-trade at Newca&s;tle, and were, like the latter, a kind of mediators between the buyers and &s;ellers. Cambden, in his Britannia, vol. ii. fol. 1319, gives the following etymon:</P>
<P>"The word ho&s;tmen may not improperly be taken to be traders into the ea&s;tern parts of Europe, and may have their name from the Latin word ou&s;tmanni, <HI>i. e.</HI> the ea&s;tmen, a trading into tho&s;e parts, as well as the ou&s;tmanni, <HI>i. e.</HI> the ea&s;tmen, who came from the &s;ea coa&s;t of Germany into Ireland, where, under colour of trade and merchandi&s;e, being admitted into &s;ome of their cities, in a &s;hort time they began a very terrible war."</P>

It is lawful to di&s;train the goods of ru&s;ties, and tho&s;e that live in the country, within their markets and without, within their hou&s;es al&s;o and without; and that without licence of the bailiff, unle&s;s when they come to the court, or be in the army, or guarding the ca&s;tle; but it is not lawful for one burge&s;s to di&s;train the goods of another, without leave of the bailiff Of mayor. If a burge&s;s inherit any thing from a villain, or other per|&s;on, the pleas that are moved in the borough may be pleaded there, except tho&s;e that be|long to the crown. If a burge&s;s be indited, let him not be impleaded without the borough, unle&s;s for defect of court, nor ought he to an&s;wer concerning an appeal without day or term, unle&s;s he has happened to give a fooli&s;h an&s;wer, or in matters relating to the crown, or belore the ju&s;tices itinerant.</P>
<P>"If a &s;hip arrive at Tinmouth, and will not go away, by a council of the burge&s;&s;es, any per&s;on may purcha&s;e merchandi&s;e of that &s;hip.&mdash;If a plea be moved between the burge&s;&s;es and an itinerant merchant, the matter may be determined before three floods of the tide. Merchandi&s;es brought to the town by &s;ea, ought to be canied a&s;hore, except &s;alt and herring, which may be &s;old on board. Whoever &s;hall hold land in the borough a year and a day ju&s;tly, and without claim, if the claimant be within the kingdom, he is not bound to an&s;wer &s;uch claimant. If a burge&s;s have a &s;on at his table in his hou&s;e, let the &s;on have equal liberty with his father.&mdash;If a villain come to the borough to &s;tay and hold land in the borough a year and a day, without any prolocution of his lord or him&s;elf to any term, let him remain in the borough as a burge&s;s. No foreigner ought to buy cloth to dye, unle&s;s he be of the cu&s;tom of the borough. Any burge&s;s may &s;ell his land, and go where he plea&s;es, unle&s;s his land be indited or claimed. If a burge&s;s be impleaded in a plea, whence battle may ari&s;e, by any villain, or inhabitant of the country, let him defend him&s;elf by the law, which he has in his cu&s;tom, unle&s;s he be impeached of any crime, for which he ought ju&s;tly to light, nor ought a burge&s;s to fight with a villain, if there be not a prior claim to his burgage. It is not lawful for a foreign merchant to buy wool, &s;kins, or any other things, either in the market or the country. The forfeiture of a burge&s;s towards the bailiff ought to go to the common fund. In the borough there ought neither to be given merchet, heriot, bloodwit, or &s;tengedwit. Every burge&s;s may have a furnace and mill. If any one &s;ell any of his bread or ale, it &s;hall be forfeited to the bailiff, who may act thus: if he incurs the forfeit twice, he mu&s;t pay it; if three, he mu&s;t be puni&s;hed by common-council of the burge&s;&s;es. No foreigner to be permitted to cut fi&s;h to &s;ell. A burge&s;s may carry his corn out of the country whither&s;oever he plea&s;es without licence."</P></NOTE>.</HEAD>
<P>ALL the &s;ons of a free burge&s;s claim the franchi&s;e of their father by patrimony: there is a kind of double franchi&s;e; the fellow&s;hip with

the general body, called the freedom of the town, and that of &s;ome particular company, u&s;ually &s;tyled the freedom of a trade; and the per|&s;on who enjoys both is &s;aid to be free of town and trade.</P>
<P>If a father, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a right of franchi&s;e, die before admi&s;&s;ion, all his &s;ons forfeit their claim. No natural &s;on can inherit the franchi&s;e.</P>
<P>with a right to vote for two repre&s;entatives in parliament, every bur|ge&s;s, and widow of a burge&s;s, may claim two &s;tints on the common and common-pa&s;ture of the town. Every freeman is al&s;o exempt from the payment of tolls, quay dues, river dues, &amp;c. Franchi&s;e is al&s;o obtained by &s;ervitude. Anciently this &s;ervitude was in &s;ome companies for ten years; it cannot at pre&s;ent be for le&s;s than &s;even. A ma&s;ter, being free of the town only, cannot make his apprentice<NOTE N="v" PLACE="foot"><P>Kennet, in the Glo&s;&s;ary to his Parochial Antiquities, cites a deed, dated 12 Ed.

IV. that "none &s;hall put &s;on on daughter to &s;erve as ap|prentice to any craft in any city or borough, except they have land or rent to the value of twenty &s;hillings per annum. Apprentices are mentioned in the ordinaries of the &s;adlers and glovers companies of Newca&s;tle, dated 1436. The&s;e are the earlie&s;t accounts I have met with of this kind of &s;ervitude.</P></NOTE> free; for, in order to this, the franchi&s;e of &s;ome company is indi&s;pen&s;able.</P>
<P><PB N="367" REF="377">Some privileges are obtained by marriage: if a per&s;on who has a right to the franchi&s;e of Newca&s;tle, marry a freeman's daughter before his admi&s;&s;ion, he pays on &s;uch admi&s;&s;ion 6<ABBR>s.</ABBR> 8<ABBR>d.</ABBR> le&s;s than tho&s;e who claim the &s;ame freedom either by patrimony or &s;ervitude.</P>
<P>The franchi&s;e devolves on a freeman's widow; &s;he can enfranchi&s;e the apprentices of her hu&s;band, if he had been free of any company, and &s;he continues to carry on his b&s;fine&s;s; &s;he inherits al&s;o her hu&s;|band's exemption from tolls, quay dues, &amp;c. all which are lo&s;t if &s;he afterwards marry a non-freeman.</P>
<P>The franchi&s;e of Newca&s;tle, it is &s;aid, cannot be &s;old, but may be pre&s;ented as a gift, when it is u&s;ually &s;tyled an honorary or per&s;onal freedom.</P>
<P>It has been generally &s;uppo&s;ed, that an honorary freeman can neither tran&s;mit his franchi&s;e to his &s;ons, nor confer it upon his apprentices.</P>
<P>The determination of this que&s;tion will, probably, at &s;ome time or other, occa&s;ion much trouble to the corporation of Newca&s;tle.</P>
<P>The form of the oath, on the admi&s;&s;ion of a freeman of Newca&s;tle, concludes with an expre&s;&s;ion that &s;eems to imply that every burge&s;s is bound to a per&s;onal defence of the town.</P>
<P>It is u&s;ual, on admi&s;&s;ion, to pre&s;ent the mayor or alderman who ad|mits, with a &s;ilver penny.</P>
<P>By the charter of the 42d of Elizabeth, March 22d, 1600, it was ordered that burge&s;&s;es &s;hould be admitted by the mayor and burge&s;&s;es, or common-council, whereof the mayor and &s;ix aldermen were to be &s;even.</P>
<P>By the charter of King James I. 1604, all cu&s;toms, rights and liberties of the town of Newca&s;tle, held by former charter or pre&s;crip|tion, were confirmed to it.</P>
<P><PB N="368" REF="378">The following pa&s;&s;age occurs in the ordinary of the bakers and brewers, dated September 28th, 1579. Every brother was enjoined to live in the town of Newca&s;tle, and "continue therein as a burge&s;&s;e of the &s;ame towne, to watch and ward, and beare &s;cott and lott as other burge&s;&s;es of the &s;ame towne ought to doe."</P>
<P>No freeholder in Newca&s;tle has a right to vote for a member of parliament for that town, as &s;uch, unle&s;s he be al&s;o a free burge&s;s thereof; neither have they votes for repre&s;entatives for the county of Northumberland; &s;o that by far the greater number of the inhabitants cannot be &s;aid to be repre&s;ented in parliament.</P>
<P>The odium anciently entertained again&s;t the Scotti&s;h nation, and which hardly yet has &s;ub&s;ided among the vulgar, mu&s;t be referred to as one of the leading rea&s;ons, why &s;o few of the pre&s;ent inhabitants of Newca&s;tle enjoy the franchi&s;e of that town. There is a clau&s;e in the ordinary of almo&s;t every company, that no Scot&s;man born &s;hould be taken apprentice; and it is highly improbable that any of that once ho&s;tile people would, at lea&s;t before the time of King James I. be ad|mitted to a freedom of the town, either after re&s;iding any time in it, or on the payment of a fine: which &s;eem to have been the ancient terms of admi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>There was an E&s;&s;ay on Charters publi&s;hed a few years ago at New|ca&s;tle upon Tyne, by Mr. Collier, in which the account of the origin of burge&s;&s;es, except of the claim by &s;ervitude, is entirely chimerical, and evinces in almo&s;t every line that the writer was totally unacquaint|ed with his &s;ubject.</P>

<P>WHATEVER relates to this &s;ubject is extremely intere&s;ting, as the&s;e miracle plays were the fir&s;t and earlie&s;t of our dramatic exhibitions<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Warton's Hi&s;tory of Poetry, vol. i. p. 242.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The&s;e appear to have been acted in the open air, in what was called in &s;ome places the Play-Field, or in &s;ome &s;pot calculated to &s;hew the performance to the greate&s;t crowd of &s;pectators<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Arnot's Hi&s;tory of Edinburgh, p. 76.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>They are reported to have been many of them very indelicate and ob&s;cene<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>They were not without their u&s;e<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot"><P>Warton ut &s;upra, vol. ii. p. 179. "Not only," he tells us, "in teaching the great truths of &s;cripture to men who could not read the bible, but in aboli&s;hing the barbarous attachment to military games and the bloody contentions of the tournament, which had &s;o long, pre|vailed as the &s;ole &s;picies of popular amu&s;ement.&mdash;Rude, and even ridiculous, as they were, they &s;oftened the manners of the pcople, by diverting the publick attention to &s;pectacles in which the mind was concerned." See al&s;o Appendix to Drake's Eboracum, p. 29, 30, 31.</P>
<P>I know not when this kind of entertainment fir&s;t began. The Che&s;ter plays appear to have been written A. D. 1328.</P>
<P>Mr. Warton, who &s;miles at the idea of their having anciently committed to the black|&s;miths the handling of the "Purification," an old play &s;o called, would have had &s;till greater rea&s;on, could he have a&s;&s;igned with truth to the company of taylors "the De&s;cent into Hell."</P></NOTE> however, not only in impre&s;&s;ing on the rude minds of an unlettered pcople the chief hi&s;tories of their

<P>By the ordinary of the millers, dated 1578, we may infer that the Corpus Chri&s;ti plays were at that time on the decline, and never acted but by a &s;pecial command of the magi&s;trates of Newca&s;tle. "When&s;o|ever," &s;ays that authority, "the generall plaies of the towne &s;hall be commanded by the mayor, &amp;c." they are to play "the an|tient playe of their fellow&s;hip, called "the Deliverance of the Chil|dren of I&s;rell out of the Thraldome, Bondage, and Servitude of King Pharo<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot"><P>The title of the weavers' play was the "Beringe of the Cro&s;&s;e."</P>
<P>Weaver, in his Funeral Monuments, p. 405, informs us that about the beginning of the reign of King James, the&s;e Corpus Chri&s;ti plays were finally &s;uppre&s;&s;ed in all towns of the kingdom.</P></NOTE>."</P>
<P>Thus al&s;o in that of the hou&s;e-carpenters, dated July 3d, 1579, it is ordered, that "when&s;oever the generall plaies of the towne &s;hall be plaied," they &s;hall play "the Burial of Chri&s;t," pertaining an|ciently to the &s;aid fellow&s;hip.</P>
<P>To this effect al&s;o it was ordered by that of the ma&s;ons A. D. 1581, "that at all times hereafter for ever when&s;oever the generall plaies of the towne of Newca&s;tle, antiently called the Corpus Chri&s;ti plays, &s;hall be plaied, they &s;hall cau&s;e to be &s;et forth and plaied among other plaies of the &s;aid towne the plaie antientlye named "the Buriall of our Lady Saint Mary the Virgin."</P>
<P>And la&s;tly, by the joiners' ordinary, dated 1589, it was provided that "when&s;oever it &s;hall be thought nece&s;&s;ary by the mayor, &amp;c. to comand to be &s;ett forth and plaied or exerci&s;ed any general playe or martial exerci&s;e, they &s;hall attend on the &s;ame and do what is a&s;&s;igned them."</P>
<P>Bourne has pre&s;erved the following copy of the ancient play belong|ing to the company of &s;hipwrights, in Newca&s;tle upon Tyne. I &s;ought in vain in all the archives of the &s;everal &s;ocieties of that town for another. After the reformation, they were probably de&s;troyed in|du&s;triou&s;ly as reliques of popi&s;h &s;uper&s;tition.</P>

By this time, or more probably at a &s;till earlier period, a Roman way conducted hither from the more &s;outhern parts of the pro|vince: I know not whether the appearance of that road in &s;ucceeding times, from the top of the hill now called Bottle-Bank, might not have given its pre&s;ent appellation to Gate&s;head, of which the &s;imple etymology is "the head of the gate," <HI>i. e.</HI> way.

<P>That "Ad Murum" was the then name of Newca&s;tle, &s;eems to be clearly proved by the Itinerary of Richard of Cirence&s;ter, di&s;covered &s;ince the publication of the Britannia Romana, and edited by a Mr. Bertram, who was &s;o fortunate as to find the MS. in Sweden. It appears not only from the very curious ancient map affixed to this work, but al&s;o from the fourth and fifth iters de&s;cribed therein, that the Roman way divided at Vino|vium, the pre&s;ent Binche&s;ter, in the county of Durham, from whence one of the branches conducted to Corbridge, &amp;c. by way of Lanche&s;ter and Ebche&s;ter, while the other led through Epiacum, the pre&s;ent Che&s;ter-le-Street, to the town called "Ad Murum," upon the Roman wall, the pre&s;ent Newca&s;tle upon Tyne, where it &s;eems to have terminated, as no ve&s;tiges thereof have ever been traced to the north of that place.</P>
<P>This Richard of Cirence&s;ter lived about the end of the fourteenth century, and appears to have been the Leland of his age.&mdash;He &s;earched all our mona&s;tic libraries, and drew up the geography of Britain from memoirs left by a Roman general, whom Dr. Stukeley per&s;uades him&s;elf to have been Agricola. Hor&s;eley, p. 387, &s;eems to authori&s;e this &s;up|po&s;ition, ob&s;erving that mo&s;t of our military ways were probably laid by Agricola; none certainly were made till after Claudius' conque&s;t, A.

Of five hundred places which it mentions in Britain and Ireland, one hundred and fifty are new or more correctly fixed.&mdash;Gough's Brit. Topog. vol. i. p. 13.</P>
<P>Dr. Stukeley is of opinion that the original itinerary and map which Richard copied, was con&s;tructed in Agricola's time, though afterwards additions were made to it.&mdash;Such names as ad pontem, ad murum, ad vallum, &amp;c. intimate that the roads were generally made or marked out, but towns, cities, ca&s;tles not then built.</P></NOTE> again of

this place under the new appellation of Ad Murum (at wall), and the re&s;idence of a Northumbrian king<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot"><P>Bede tells us that Peada, the &s;on of Pendan, King of the Midland Angles, came to O&s;win, King of Northumberland, to demand his daughter Alcfleda in marriage. O&s;win refu&s;ed his con&s;ent to this match, till Peada &s;hould be baptized and embrace Chri&s;tianity. Either through the love of this fair virgin, or of truth, the condition was accepted, and he was baptized, together with his retinue, adds this writer, by Bi&s;hop Finan, at a royal town called Ad Murum, which, in the next chapter he tells us, was clo&s;e to the Roman wall and at the di&s;tance of twelve miles from the ea&s;tern &s;ea.&mdash;Lib. iii. cap. 21.</P>
<P>Dr. Smith, in his note on the above pa&s;&s;age, differs, as he well might, from the common opinion that Ad Murum was the pre&s;ent Walton, a village near the confines of Cumber|land, and above thirty miles from the &s;ea, and fixes it at Walbottle, an ob&s;cure village, about &s;ix miles we&s;t of Newca&s;tle. A &s;imilarity of &s;ound in the name has, it &s;eems, occa|&s;ioned both the&s;e errors, for &s;uch have our later di&s;coveries clearly enabled us to call them; Ad Murum being unque&s;tionably the pre&s;ent Newca&s;tle upon Tyne, where there are &s;till both traditionary and printed accounts, that the Saxon kings of Northumberland had their palace. See Grey's Chorographia, p. 12. "After the departure of the Romans, the kings of Northumberland kept their re&s;idence and had their hou&s;e now called Pandon-Hall; it was a &s;afe bulwark, having the Picts wall on the north &s;ide, and the river of Tyne on the &s;outh." The Roman mea&s;ures would probably be retained in Bede's time; and if we believe Dr. Gale, who, in his edition of Antoninus' Itinerary, tells us that fifteen Engli&s;h miles an&s;wer to twenty Roman, his account of the di&s;tance of Newca&s;tle from the &s;ea will be &s;trictly true.</P></NOTE>.</P>
<P>During the heptarchy, which la&s;ted from the year 587 to 826, New|ca&s;tle upon Tyne, by the name of Ad Murum, or the later appella|tion of Monk-Che&s;ter, appears to have continued to be one of the chief &s;eats of our Northumbrian kings<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot"><P>"The Saxons (who generally built on Roman foundations) held it in the greate&s;t e&s;teem, and during the heptarchy made it the chief &s;eat of the kings of the Northumbers, who adorned it with &s;o great a number of mona&s;teries that from them it obtained the name of Munk-Che&s;ter."&mdash;Warburton's MS.

<P>In the preface to the Hi&s;tory of the Nunnery of Newca&s;tle, are hazarded conjectures why Ad Murum changed its name for Monk-Che&s;ter, which cannot appear altogether improbable to tho&s;e who are inclined to think, with our writers in general, that that ap|pellation &s;ignifies "the fortified re&s;idence of monks," an etymology which, however, has been controverted by Charlton, in his Hi&s;tory of Whitby, p. 51, where he endeavours to explain it to be a corruption of "Roman Che&s;ter."</P></NOTE>.</P>

<P>On the morning of the 19th, in&s;tead of the ho&s;tages that were ex|pected, the Scotti&s;h general received a letter from the governor, &amp;c. of Newca&s;tle, containing their re&s;olution not to give a final an&s;wer till the Monday following.

<P>The Scots interpreted this la&s;t letter of Sir John Marley as an in&s;ult, and began, almo&s;t in&s;tantly after the receipt thereof, a mo&s;t violent firing from their &s;everal batteries upon the town-wall, and the &s;everal regiments were drawn up, &s;tanding to their arms while the breaches were in readine&s;s, and the mines &s;prung. About three o'clock in the afternoon, tlie town garri&s;on by their counter-mines had very nearly approached &s;ome chambers, where the gun-powder was lodged for blowing up the walls; which being &s;ignified to General Leven, he or|dered immediately that fire &s;hould be given to tho&s;e two mines endan|gered, and afterwards to maintain the breaches carefully, whil&s;t a general a&s;&s;ault &s;hould be made from all quarters: a little after, the day failing and the breaches being made, though not &s;o large and pa&s;&s;able as was

needful, the re&s;t of the mines were fired, and the regiments advanced all at once towards the breaches, and tho&s;e places of the wall which were opened by the mines. In this attempt, however, they were ex|cellently entertained by the be&s;ieged, who left nothing une&s;&s;ayed to repel the fury of the a&s;&s;ault. They played ince&s;&s;antly from the ca&s;tle upon the breaches and the flanking towers of the walls, with &s;cattered &s;hot; and the Scots received a con&s;iderable lo&s;s of &s;oldiers and officers of quality: yet &s;till tliey pre&s;&s;ed on, and, after two hours de&s;perate di&s;|pute upon the breaches, forced their fir&s;t entry at the mine &s;prung on the we&s;t &s;ide of the town, near to Clo&s;e-Gate.

And no marvel, for they were accounted 30,000 men, and the town&s;men were but in all 1500 men, wearied with continual watch and duty, though men of great courage, and &s;ought it gallantly to the la&s;t: for the Newgate-Ward, which was under Captain Cuthbert Carr, was taken by the enemy, who entered at the afore&s;aid places, and encompa&s;&s;ed them be|fore and behind: and Pilgrim-Street-Gate was maintained by Captain George Errington, Lieutenant William Rob&s;on, and En&s;ign Thomas Swan, who &s;ought and killed very many: they them&s;elves not having one hurt, until they were encompa&s;&s;ed by the enemy before and behind; and even then they would not parley with the Scots, who &s;ougth again&s;t them without, but did capitulate with Lieutenant Colonel Smelair who loved and ho|noured them, and kept his agreement well with them, that not one of them was &s;obbed of his clothes or money, not were any of his men &s;uffered to give any evil word; and it was the great ble&s;&s;ing of God that in all that time there was not one man &s;lain nor hurt, although that company con&s;i&s;ted of nine &s;core men, all trade&s;men: and there were divers fallies made out at that gate, for it was the longe&s;t of all the gates of the town, being barrocaded and &s;hut up.

<P>"Thus," adds Bourne, "was the town taken from the King, after an ob&s;tinate and gallant defence, and may well a&s;&s;ume the motto be&s;towed upon it, 'Fortiter defendendo triumphans.'

At the mouth of this river &s;tands a large village called Tinmouth, with a fort, which com|mands the entry; but is in bad repair towards the land&mdash;ve&s;&s;els of 500 tons can enter the harbour. The town is &s;urrounded only by an old ruinous wall, without ramparts or ditches; and is commanded by heights on all &s;ides. It is in this neighbourhood they dig the coals, which are &s;o well known throughout all the kingdom, as coals are &s;hipped only from thence and from Sunderland, a &s;mall town at three leagues di&s;tance, which is &s;carcely known but by the nobleman who takes his title from it. From London to New|ca&s;tle, there are &s;eventy leagues of as fine a country as is in the world; fifteen from New|ca&s;tle to Scotland, and twenty to Lanca&s;ter. In the counties of York, We&s;tmoreland, Cum|berland, Northumberland, and in the bi&s;hoprick of Durham, are all the excellent &s;tuds; con&s;equently the cavalry and dragoons might be ea&s;ily mounted. Be&s;ides 20,000 car|riages and cart hor&s;es, which carry coals from the mines to Newca&s;tle and Sunderland, will be found in that country, and may be u&s;eful for carrying the baggage of the army; but a more important con&s;ideration is, that the greate&s;t part of the inhabitants of the&s;e di&s;tricts are well affected towards his maje&s;ty, and may join him without any hindrance. The length of the navigation is the only objection that can be fore&s;een; to which it may be an&s;wered, that the difficulty con&s;i&s;ts in &s;ailing from Dunkirk, and leaving the coa&s;t; but that &s;hips when they are once at &s;ea have nothing to fear; and it is immaterial whe|ther the de&s;cent is made on the &s;econd or on the fourth day.

<P>"On Monday, October 10th, 1715, the rebels marched to Morpeth, about 300 &s;trong, all hor&s;e; they had expectation of &s;urprizing Newca&s;tle; preparing to march to New|ca&s;tle, which they expected &s;hould open its gates to them, a party having &s;eized the po&s;t at Felton-Bridge, and one Thomas Gib&s;on, a black&s;mith of Newca&s;tle, whom they ap|prehended, and detained as a &s;py, which he is thought to have been from Alderman White, of Newca&s;tle, a zealous gentleman for the govemment; and finding &s;ome delay in it, they promi&s;ed them&s;elves to have it in a few days, and in the mcan time marched to Hex|ham. But even before any regular forces entered Newca&s;tle, the magi&s;trates and deputy lieutenants, having fir&s;t &s;u&s;picion, and &s;oon after po&s;itive intelligence of the de&s;igns of the rebels to &s;urpri&s;e it, had effectually prevented it, and had taken all imaginable precaution for their &s;ecurity, rai&s;ing immediately what men they could, &s;ecuring and impri&s;oning all papi&s;ts and &s;u&s;pected per&s;ons; arming and encouraging the inhabitants for their own de|fence. Indeed, the magi&s;trates &s;hewed a very commendable zeal in the intere&s;t of the King, and the &s;ervice of the town; and no le&s;s courage in their application to the defence of the place. They got the militia and train bands, who about that time were ordered to mu&s;ter at Killingworth-Moor, near the town, to be taken into it for its better defence. At the &s;ame time the Earl of Scarborough, lord lieutenant of the county of Northumberland, repaired with his friends to Newca&s;tle; and the gentry of tho&s;e parts, after his lord&s;hip's example, mounted their neighbours and tenants on hor&s;ebakc, &s;o that the town was full of hor&s;es and men, both town&s;men and countrymen unanimou&s;ly declaring for King George. A body of 700 volunteers were armed by the town for their immediate guard. The keel|men offered a body of 700 men more to be always ready at half an hour's warning; an a&s;&s;ociation having been &s;igned by the whole body of loyal inhabitants. In the middle of this hurry, a battalion of foot, and part of a regiment of dragoons, came to Newca&s;tle, and than all their fears vani&s;hed. On the 18th of October, Lieutenant-General Carpenter, with Hotham's regiment of foot, and Cobham's, Mole&s;worth's, and Churchill's draggons, arrived at Newca&s;tle, the gates of which were walled up with &s;tone and lime very &s;trong.

<P>In the night between Saturday the 16th and Sunday 17th of No|vember this year, the river Tyne, &s;woln to an amazing height by a land flood, which had been occa&s;ioned by an unremitted fall of heavy rains in the we&s;t, &s;wept away the bridge at Newca&s;tle upon Tyne, with the lo&s;s of many lives, and immen&s;e damages of the inhabitants of that place, and its vicinity<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot"><P>About eleven o'clock it began, and continued to ri&s;e till about &s;even o'clock next morning, when it was about &s;even feet four inches above the common flow of a good &s;pring tide, in Bewick's entry, in the &s;treet called the Clo&s;e. It continued at a &s;tand between &s;even and eight o'clock next morning, and then gradually decrea&s;ed. About two o'clock that morning, &s;everal &s;hips and keels were driven from their moorings, and a very great quantity of tar, timber, deals, &amp;c. was &s;wept off the key, upon which al&s;o four &s;hips were left &s;tranded, when the flood &s;ub&s;ided. About an hour afterwards, the arches of Tyne bridge began to fill up, and between three and four o'clock, part of it to|wards Gate&s;head fell in, and &s;even of the inhabitants were drowned. The &s;toppage of water at the bridge occa&s;ioned a violent current in the Clo&s;e and Sandhill, to the north corner of which a boat was rowed. About five o'clock, the north arch adjoining to the toll &s;hop on the bridge fell in: providentially the wind blew from the north-ea&s;t; had it blown from the we&s;t, it might have occa&s;ioned a greater rapidity, and been attended with &s;till more fatal con&s;equences. The water fell between eight and nine o'clock five inches; from nine to ten, &s;ixteen inches; from ten to eleven, twenty-five inches; from eleven to twelve, thirty-two inches; from twelve to one, it fell four feet; from one to two, five feet four inches; and was off the key at four o'clock that afternoon, when it had &s;ub&s;ided in all about eight feet.&mdash;Paper communicated by Mr. Thomas Aubone.</P>

<P>"He &s;aid moreover, that before and at the time of making King Richard's charter, which was before any liberties granted to Newca&s;tle by King John, the priors of this hou&s;e took and had all the premi&s;es freely and quietly, &amp;c. by virtue of cu&s;tom of liberties granted to them by their &s;aid charter by land and water, whereof he found his church &s;eized, &amp;c.</P>

<P>"And as to the charging or di&s;charging of &s;hips, and of merchandi&s;es, &amp;c. they &s;aid, that whereas the &s;aid port of Tyne is only the King's, as often as the prior &s;hould do &s;o, the King was manife&s;tly injured, being then, and always before, in &s;eizin and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the &s;aid port.</P>

<P>"They al&s;o &s;aid, that in tho&s;e hou&s;es at Shields, there were fi&s;hers and brewers, and victuallers, &amp;c. &s;o rich that they were able to give loading and victuals for 100 or 200 &s;hips, which ought to apply them&s;elves at Newca&s;tle upon Tyne, and there buy their victuals for the bettering the &s;aid town. Whereupon they &s;aid, that the &s;aid prior is the only occupier of the King's &s;oil, and the only taker away of the &s;aid King's town of Newca&s;tle, and that he the &s;aid prior had &s;ixteen fi&s;hers or more, with great boats, fi&s;hing in the &s;ea yearly for traffick's &s;ake only, and not for maintenance of his hou&s;e; whereof the King received neither toll nor cu&s;tom.</P>
<P>They &s;aid al&s;o, that the &s;aid prior and his men come out with their hor&s;es and car|riages, and out of &s;uch &s;hips as came thither, got nece&s;&s;aries for them&s;elves, &s;o that mo&s;t times &s;hips and boats return empty and half laden to other ports than to New|ca&s;tle afore&s;aid, whereby the King cannot receive his due pri&s;es and cu&s;toms.</P>
<P>"And after they &s;aid that John of the Vale, I &s;uppo&s;e De le Val, being judge itine|rant, 7 Edw. I. It was then reported by the jury, that the prior of Tinmouth built a $word$ upon the bank on the water of Tyne on one &s;ide, and the prior of Durham levied, or built another on the other &s;ide, where no towns ought to be, unle&s;s lodges only for fi&s;hermen; and that the fi&s;hermen have there &s;old their fi&s;hes, which ought to have been &s;old at Newca&s;tle, to the great hurt of the &s;aid town, and lo&s;s of the King's pri&s;es: and that both the &s;aid priors of Tinmouth and Durham have cau&s;ed to be made brewers, and fi&s;hers, having great &s;hips, whereas they ought to have but boats, and have cau&s;ed bread to be baked there, which ought to have been baked at New|ca&s;tle.</P>

<P>"THE <HI>original claim</HI> of the <HI>mayor and burge&s;&s;es</HI> to the <HI>juri&s;diction of the river Tyne,</HI> was from King <HI>Henry the Sixth.</HI></P>

<P>"The Queen, by her letters patent, dated the <HI>30th day of Augu&s;t,</HI> in the <HI>31&s;t year</HI> of her <HI>reign,</HI> touching the office of the high admiralty of the river of Tine and port of Newca&s;tle, <HI>grants the rever&s;ion to the mayor and burge&s;&s;es of Newca&s;tle,</HI> by rea&s;on it, was granted under the great &s;eal of England, bearing date the <HI>fifth of February,</HI> 1522, unto <HI>Charles Lord Howard of Effingham,</HI> among&s;t other things, in his &s;aid patent in the office of lord high admiral of England, &amp;c. for life, <HI>who outlived the Queen,</HI> and <HI>died 26th January in the &s;ixteenth</HI> year of <HI>King James.</HI></P>
<P>"King James, in the &s;econd year of his reign, being humbly &s;upplicated by the mayor and burge&s;&s;es of Newca&s;tle, that he would be graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed to confirm all their antient grants and charters, and to give them further powers, e&s;pecially of the river Tyne, the King confirms the&s;e charters, but grants nothing new, only alters the election of their officers, and pre&s;cribes them new oaths to be admini&s;tred to the &s;aid officers in their elections, which charter is in the Chapel of Rolls.</P>
<P>"Al&s;o, the King and his Council grants them the con&s;ervancy of the river of Tyne, by giving <HI>nine articles</HI> upon the <HI>29th of January,</HI> 1613, and joined in the &s;aid order <HI>the Bi&s;hop of Durham</HI> and other ju&s;tices of peace of the county of Durham and Northum|berland, with the &s;ix aldermen of the &s;aid town of Newca&s;tle. But <HI>three years after</HI> the mayor, aldermen and jury of the burge&s;&s;es, exhibited a <HI>great complaint to the king and Council</HI> at Whitehall, <HI>of the great decay of the river,</HI> occa&s;ioned by the &s;aid commi&s;&s;ioners, through their neglect and breach of tru&s;t.

<P>HAVING this day viewed the harbour of Tinmouth, and particularly that part of the entry thereof lying between the Low-Lights and the Black-Middens; I am of opinion that it will be a great addition to the &s;ecurity of ve&s;&s;els entering and going our of the &s;aid harbour; if the loo&s;e &s;tones that lie &s;cattered upon the North &s;hore, between the Mu&s;cle-Scalp and the Prior-Stones, were removed: the&s;e &s;tones in &s;ome places ex|tend them&s;elves into the channel, &s;o that &s;hips which happen by accident to take the ground, often receive damage that would be prevented by their removal; and al&s;o by affording a greater width and capacity, would greatly add to the convenience of ve&s;|&s;els working to windward, either into or out of the harbour.</P>
<P>The rocks called the Prior-Stones, I am of opinion, for the &s;ame rea&s;on, &s;hould be re|moved and made level; together with &s;uch others as ob&s;truct the channel, as far as they can be got at.</P>
<P>The &s;tones that lie near the Black-Middens, may be &s;towed away in the hollows of this ledge of rocks, &s;o as to &s;trengthen and increa&s;e the utility thereof, as a break|water, and which, if carefully depo&s;ited in the method of a pile of cannon-&s;hot, I am of opinion, will lie, where they &s;hall be placed. Tho&s;e at a greater di&s;tance may be laid in the &s;ame method, on a ridge extending over the highe&s;t part of the ground be|tween the Black-Middens and the &s;hore; which will al&s;o add to the break-water, and in &s;ome mea&s;ure prevent the current from dividing near high-water into two chan|nels; and as to tho&s;e &s;tones that lie up &s;till nearer to the Mu&s;cle-Scalp, they may be depo&s;ited under the high cliffs, which will tend to the defence and &s;ecurity th$$$$$. Tho&s;e &s;tones may be removed in different ways; each of which according to $$$$$$|&s;tances may have its advantage; and indeed, I would advi&s;e them all to be tried, from whence it may be with certainty determined which way is ex$c$$able at the lea&s;t charge.</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. The &s;maller kind of &s;tones may be moved by hand-barrows.</P>

<P>PURSUANT to the reque&s;t of the right wor&s;hipful John Baker, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> mayor, and of the corporation of Newca&s;tle upon Tyne:</P>
<P>We the ma&s;ter, &amp;c. of this hou&s;e, having this day taken a &s;urvey of the rocks and loo&s;e &s;tones, lying between the Low-Lights and Black-Middens, are of opinion, that taking up and removing the &s;aid rocks and &s;tones, would be of the greate&s;t advantage and utility to the navigation of the river Tyne, viz. where the rocks and &s;tones now lie, there would be a bed of ouze and &s;and, con&s;equently a fine ba&s;on and re&s;ervoir for the fir&s;t influx of the &s;tood-tide; and it is evident that &s;hips or ve&s;&s;els will work in or out of the river Tyne with the greater &s;afety.</P>

<HEAD><HI>APPENDIX, P. 32. (No. 2.)</HI> A particular Ca&s;e determined in the Court of King's Bench, on the Act, viz. 19 Geo. II. for the better Pre&s;ervation of Rivers in England.</HEAD>
<P>A PERSON invented a machine or ve&s;&s;el, called a Hopper (and obtained a patent for it), to take balla&s;t out of &s;hips in rivers, in order to convey the &s;ame to the &s;ea, and there drop it. The Hopper was &s;o contrived, that the balla&s;t. might be dropped from its bottom any where at plea&s;ure, as opportunities offered, without being perceived by any, but tho&s;e in the Hopper, or very near it.</P>
<P>This Hopper came into the river Tyne, and (be&s;ides the above objection), after trial, it was found to wa&s;te its balla&s;t as it &s;ailed, in &s;uch a degree, as to di&s;colour the water where it pa&s;&s;ed; and being generally di&s;approved of, Alderman Smith, a ju&s;tice of the peace at Newca&s;tle upon Tyne (in order to put a &s;top to its being further u&s;ed there), upon an information made to him, again&s;t one Bruckle&s;bank, a &s;hipma&s;ter, for balla&s;t being ca&s;t out of his &s;hip into the Hopper, in order that &s;uch balla&s;t might be dropt into the water, and not ca&s;t on the land where the tide never flows, &s;ummoned Bruck|le&s;bank, and, on due proof, convicted and fined him according to the act: Bruckle&s;|bank, &s;upported by the patentee, brought an action again&s;t the alderman for &s;o doing, which was tried at Northumberland a&s;&s;izes, when the jury gave a &s;pecial verdict, whereon the ca&s;e was argued in the court of King's Bench, and decided as follows, viz.</P>
<P>M. 32. G. 2. Bruckle&s;bank and Smith. On a &s;pecial verdict from Northumberland a&s;&s;izes, it was &s;tated, that the defendant, Mr. Smith, was a ju&s;tice or the peace for the town and county of Newca&s;tle upon Tyne; and that the plaintiff was ma&s;ter of a &s;hip, floating in the river Tyne, being a navigable river; that three tons of balla&s;t and more were unloaded out of the &s;aid &s;hip, into a machine or ve&s;&s;el called a Hopper, in the &s;aid river, with intent that it &s;hould be carried therein into the high and open &s;eas, and that it was accordingly carried out of the &s;aid river into the high and open &s;eas, and was there ca&s;t out of the &s;aid Hopper, where the water was more than 14 fathom deep, at a di&s;tance from any port, haven, channel, or navigable river: whereupon the &s;aid Mr. Smith convicted the plaintiff as an offender again&s;t this act. And the plaintiff brought his action. It was urged, on behalf of the plaintiff, that this was no offence within the meaning of the act; that the mi&s;chief which the legi&s;lature had in view, was throwing the balla&s;t or rubbi&s;h either on the &s;hore, or the &s;ides of rivers, and below the full &s;ea-mark. But this was in the open and high &s;ea, above 14 fathom deep, at a di&s;tance from any port, haven, channel, or river. By Lord Mansfield, Ch. J. This is a general que&s;tion, which goes farther than this particular ca&s;e: but it is a very plain and clear ca&s;e, and expre&s;sly again&s;t the prohibition of the act; which provides, that it &s;hall not be thrown but upon the land. Whereas this man &s;ays, that he has found a better way, than that which the act has expre&s;sly pre&s;cribed: but here is &s;uch an opening to fraud in this way, that he has thought a better one, that it would be danger|ous to tru&s;t to this method, though it were not prohibited. However, it is enough, that it is contrary to the direct and expre&s;s provi&s;ion of the act. Indeed, if it was put into the Hopper, in order merely to carry it upon the land; that would only be the proper means of doing it, and therefore would not be an offence within the act: but this is with intent to lay it in the water; and there can be no &s;ecurity as to the place where the Hopper may drop it. It is mighty ea&s;y, from the con&s;truction of the Hopper, to drop it privately. And it is al&s;o the intere&s;t of the per&s;on who carries it in the
<PB N="589" REF="599">
Hopper, to drop it as &s;oon as he can; that he may come the &s;ooner again to fetch more The &s;hifting it out of one &s;hip into another, without intention to drop it any where, would not be a ca&s;e within the act: for that would not be a ca&s;ting or throw|ing out at all, within the meaning of the act. And judgment was given by the court, unanimou&s;ly, for the defendant, the ju&s;tice. Burrow, Mansfield. 656.</P>

<HEAD>APPENDIX, P. 63. JARROW.</HEAD>
<P>THE large fragment of a Roman &s;tone found at Jarrow, and in&s;cribed, "Om|nium Fil' Hadriani," &amp;c. I &s;uppo&s;e to have been part of an altar erected in honour of all the adopted &s;ons of the Emperor Hadrian: taking this for granted, the word "omnium" mu&s;t have been preceded by "pro &s;alute." See an in&s;cription on a &s;tone found at the other extremity of the Roman wall, and now or lately at Boulne&s;s, in the county of Cumberland, and others.</P>
<P>Hadrian was over in per&s;on in Britain, A. D. 120.</P>
<P>Antoninus Pius, who &s;ucceeded him in the empire, was one of tho&s;e adopted &s;ons alluded to in the in&s;cription.&mdash;Con&s;ult "Vita Hadriani&mdash;Script. Hi&s;t. Augu&s;t."</P>
<P>The other Roman &s;tone, found in the &s;ame place, appears, like that at Tinmouth, to have been a tablet on the front of &s;ome temple, or other publick building, and acquires con&s;iderable importance from the circum&s;tance of its containing the name of our i&s;land, Britannia, at full length. I &s;u&s;pect that the word "o&s;tium" has followed "utrumque;" and that it perhaps may have been brought from the &s;tation of South Shields. The word o&s;tium may, however, with the &s;tricte&s;t propriety, be applied to the very &s;pot where it was found. I &s;hall hazard an explanation of this curious in&s;crip|tion, at the &s;ame time leaving the learned, who are conver&s;ant in this &s;pecies of anti|quities and who may depend upon the faithfulne&s;s of the annexed repre&s;entation, to judge for them&s;elves.</P>
<P>I would &s;upply the lacunae thus:</P>
<P>Diffu&s;is provinciis in Britannia ad utrumque o&s;tium exercitus po&s;uit (or) &s;ieri &s;ecit.</P>
<P>And tran&s;late it as follows:</P>
<P>"The army erected this on the exten&s;ion of the Roman dominion in Britain from the we&s;tern to the ea&s;tern &s;ea."</P>
<P>N. B. I mu&s;t ob&s;erve in this place, that, as I &s;et out with a re&s;olution not to &s;uppre&s;s any hi&s;torical evidence, I could not but in&s;ert the returns of crimes found on the vi&s;i|tation of Jarrow, Tinmouth mona&s;tery, &amp;c. which I found in the Cotton Library; yet, I flatter my&s;elf I &s;hall be thought to have done this, rather to &s;hew what &s;ort of pretences were made for &s;uppre&s;&s;ing the religious hou&s;es at the Reformation, than either becau&s;e I believed the facts my&s;elf, or wi&s;hed to incline others to what I fear would be generally con&s;idered as a very uncharitable &s;pecies of credulity.</P>

<P>"I examined this with a copy which was produced at the bar of the Hou&s;e of Lords, 24th February, 1717, and &s;worn to be a true copy. G. G.</P>

<P>N. B. This clau&s;e of the King's approving of the recorder and town-clerk is new, and not in former charters; and as this charter of Charles II. is only a charter of con|firmation, and not granted npon a &s;urrender of former charters and franchi&s;es, it is doubtful whethcr this clau&s;e doth re&s;train the former liberties and charters of the cor|poration. Vide Raym. 439. Comb. 316. 1 Salkeld 168. Skinner 5769. The method of electing officers in a corporation by an old charter, cannot be altered by a new charter; but acting under the new charter, is an evidence of their con&s;ent making it good.</P>
<P>The King cannot re&s;ume an intere&s;t he hath already granted, unle&s;s the grantee concur. But in this ca&s;e, the corporation hath concurred by accepting it, and pro|ceeding accordingly, which is an evidence of their con&s;ent.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>(From Grey's MSS.)</HEAD>
<P>A^o. 1684, Sir Nath. John&s;on wrote a letter to the corporation that the King ex|pected a &s;urrender' of their charter, or that the mayor, recorder, &s;heriff, and town-clerk, might be always in the King's power to appoint or confirm; upon which the corporation &s;ent a petition to the King, &s;igned by Sir William Blatkett, mayor, and all the common-council (which is entered in the book of orders), whereby they de&s;ire the King to confirm their ancient privileges, and promi&s;e and agree that the mayor, re|corder, &s;heriff, and town-clerk, &s;hall be of his Maje&s;ty's appointing.</P>
<P>They again addre&s;s the King by Sir Geo. Jeffreys when he came judge this circuit, July, anno 1684, and promi&s;e the &s;ame thing.</P>
<P>A Quo Warranto &s;erved February 11th, 1687.</P>
<P>March 7th, 1687, a &s;urrender of their charter is actually &s;ealed, and &s;ent up&mdash;(Sir William Creagh, mayor, went to London, March 13th, with the &s;urrender)&mdash;Qu. if it was inrolled? N. B. Tlns is all entered in the book of orders.</P>
<P><PB N="643" REF="653">Vide proclamation to re&s;tore charters&mdash;printed in the State Tracts, vol. i. p. 49, by which it appears that the &s;urrender of Newca&s;tle charter was not inrolled. In a letter dated 3d November, 1688, &s;ub&s;cribed by Silve&s;ter Petyt, and directed to Mr. Douglas, are the&s;e words: "As for the-proclamation and orders touching the cor|porations, I was at the Crown-office, and the clerk told me they were all &s;ent under &s;eal to all the corporations, and that Green, a me&s;&s;enger, had tho&s;e for Newca&s;tle, and believes you have them before this; and becau&s;e you think the Gazet not &s;ufficient, I have &s;ent you the proclamation and order printed by the King's printers, and think you may (if the other be not come) give credit to the&s;e."</P>

<HEAD>A Ca&s;e concerning the Surrender of Charters to King James II. and the opinion of Mr. Holt, who was afterwards lord chief ju&s;tice of the King's Bench, taken ju&s;t before King William came in.</HEAD>
<P>THE mayor, aldermen, and common-coun&s;el, A. D. 1684, &s;urrendered to the King the magi&s;terial part of their charter (but it was not inrolled), and the King granted a new charter, and therein con&s;tituted &s;everal new aldermen, re&s;erving a power to di&s;|place the mayor and aldermen at his plea&s;ure, &s;ignified by an order of the privy &s;eal.</P>
<P>Afterwards the King (by virtue of the power in the new charter) by mandamus, December 24th, turns out the mayor and aldermen; and A^o. 1687 appoints others who are cho&s;en in their places, who make another &s;urrender of the charter (March 7th, 1687) more at large than the former &s;urrender (but this la&s;t &s;urrender was not inrolled), and a new charter granted, in which a power is re&s;erved in the King to place or di&s;place.</P>
<P>Then the King makes an order to di&s;place the new mayor, aldermen, and all officers; and by a proclamation, 17th October, 1688, requires the corporations who&s;e &s;urren|ders were not inrolled, to take upon them to act as corporations, and where places were vacant by death, or otherwi&s;e, to fill them up, and an order of coun&s;el for the purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>Qu. 1. If this proclamation doth repeal the two la&s;t charters without &s;cire facias?</P>
<P>R. I conceive the new charters are void, becau&s;e the fir&s;t was not &s;urrendered, nor was that &s;urrender of the power of making magi&s;trates inrolled, and there need no &s;cire facias.</P>
<P>Qu. 2. If the aldermen who were di&s;placed by the powers in the fir&s;t new charter, and had been aldermen before the &s;urrender, are again aldermen, and may by law act as &s;uch by virtue of the proclamation and order of coun&s;el?</P>
<P>R. Tho&s;e who were aldermen by the old charter before any &s;urrender, are alder|men, and may by law act as &s;uch.</P>
<P>Qu. 3. If tho&s;e officers in the corporation, who had offices for a year, mu&s;t not be recho&s;en before they can act?</P>
<P>R. In mo&s;t corporations the mayor, and other officers who are annual, continue af|ter the expiration of the year, until another be &s;worn; therefore I think it &s;it that he that was mayor at the time of the fir&s;t &s;urrender, do &s;urrender his office of mayor, and then that the corporation proceed to a new election of a new mayor, as in ca&s;e of death of a mayor; and after the election of the mayor, and his being &s;worn, let the &s;heriff and other officers (that are annual) and were in office at the time of the fir&s;t &s;urrender, re&s;ign their offices, and then let the corporation proceed to the electing and &s;wearing new ones in their places.</P>
<P>Qu. 4. What electors mu&s;t choo&s;e officers into vacant offices, whether tho&s;e that were electors for that year (in which) the charter was fir&s;t &s;urrendered (the electors being cho&s;en only for a year), or the election to be made by &s;ummoning the &s;everal com|panies and &s;ocieties, who u&s;ed annually on Michaelmas Monday to make an election of the mayor and other officers?</P>
<P><PB N="644" REF="654">R. Let new electors be cho&s;en for the re&s;idue of the year en&s;uing before the mayor makes his re&s;ignation of his office, and let their election be according to cu&s;tome, for the proclamation gives them this power, though the u&s;ual day be pa&s;t.</P>
<P>Qu. 5. Whether tho&s;e new-made freemen by mandates, or the la&s;t mentioned char|ters, pattents or grants, can claim any benefit or advantage thereby, or are &s;uch free|doms extingui&s;hed?</P>
<P>R. Such freedoms as were made &s;ince the fir&s;t &s;urrender are void.</P>

<HEAD><HI>APPENDIX, P. 196. Anno 1^o Gull. &amp; Mariae.</HI> An Act for erecting a Court of Con&s;cience at Newca&s;tle upon Tyne.</HEAD>
<LETTER>
<P>WHEREAS it hath been found by long experience, that the erecting of a court for recovery of &s;mall debts, and relieving of poor debtors in London, under the value of forty &s;hillings, hath been of great benefit and advantage to the poore &s;ort of freemen and inhabitants of the &s;aid city, and hath prevented many great mi&s;chiefs and inconveniencies that would otherwi&s;e have fallen upon them by the charges of arre&s;t and other proce&s;&s;e &amp; proceedings in law; and fora&s;much as the towne and county of the towne of Newca&s;tle upon Tyne is very large and populous, con&s;i&s;ting of many poor freemen, artificers, labourers, and others inhabiting therein, among&s;t whom, for want of the like good order and e&s;tabli&s;hment, divers vexatious &s;uits for divers debts, and in &s;everal actions upon the ca&s;e upon a&s;&s;ump&s;its have been and are commenced and pro&s;ecuted as well in the courts at We&s;tmin&s;ter as in other courts or places, which hath been and is the occa&s;ion of much more expence to the parties than the re&s;pective debts and cau&s;es of action for which they &s;ue have amounted unto, to the ruine of them, their wives and children, and by meanes thereof great charges to the corporation for their &s;upport and maintenance have been contracted and occa&s;ioned; for remedy whereof, be it enacted by the King and Queen's mo&s;t excellent Maje&s;ties, by and with the ad|vice and con&s;ent of the Lords &s;pirituall and temporall and Commons in this pre&s;ent par|liament a&s;&s;embled, and by authority of the &s;ame, that there be a court to be commonly called or known by the name of a Court of Reque&s;ts, or Con&s;cience, for relie&s;e of the poorer &s;ort of people in &s;mall debts and actions upon the ca&s;e upon a&s;&s;ump&s;its in the towne and county of the towne of Newca&s;tle upon Tyne erected and e&s;tabli&s;hed, and &s;uch court is hereby erected and e&s;tabli&s;hed for and within the &s;aid towne and county of the towne of Newca&s;tle upon Tyne, to have continuance for ever; and that the maior, aldermen, and common-council of the &s;aid towne for the time being (or the major part of them) whereof the mayor and &s;ix aldermen to be &s;eaven, &s;hall and are hereby impowered and required from time to time once in every yeare to nominate, elect, and choo&s;e &s;uch and &s;oe many per&s;ons as they &s;hall think fitt, not being under the

<L>And rai&s;e the &s;able rook."</L>
<BIBL>JAGO'S EDGEHILL.</BIBL></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE tools of borers are of the &s;imple&s;t kind, and con&s;i&s;t of iron rods, each between three and four feet long, and about an inch and a half &s;quare, with a &s;crew (a bed and what fits into it) at each end, by which they are united, and lengthened out as the hole increa&s;es in its depth. The chi&s;el is about eighteen inches long, and two and a half broad at the end, and is fixed to the lowe&s;t of the rods. The uppermo&s;t rod is furni&s;hed with an eye, wherein to in&s;ert a piece of timber for an handle for two or more workmen to take hold of at once. Their mode of operation is to lift up the rods a little, and then let them fall again, turning them at the &s;ame time gently round: by a continuance of this motion a round hole is fretted and worn by degrees through the harde&s;t &s;trata.</P>
<P>When the chi&s;el is quite blunted, or has cut down four or &s;ix inches, the rods are lifted up<NOTE N="$" PLACE="foot"><P>The borers can put on handles for two, three, or four per&s;ons to work, as they find it nece&s;&s;ary. After they get down to a certain depth, the rods are wrought by a bracke: a box of wood is in&s;erted fir&s;t into the ground, to keep the rods in a &s;traight direction. A triangle is erected over the &s;pot where the boring is made, for the &s;ake of drawing up the rods: they have one key to un&s;crew, and another to &s;ecure the rods from falling back again. They u&s;e a clo&s;e wimble to bring up &s;ludge and &s;oft matter.</P>
<P>The e&s;tabli&s;hed prices of boring are &s;aid to be 5 &s;hillings per fathom for the fir&s;t five fathoms&mdash;10 &s;hil|lings for the next five&mdash;15 &s;hillings per fathom for the &s;ub&s;equent five&mdash;and &s;o continually increa&s;ing, &s;hil|lings per fathom at the end of every five fathoms. The borer u&s;ually finds all his own implements; but when a whin&s;tone occurs above a foot in thickne&s;s, he is paid by the day. Three inches diameter for a bore-hole, or boring, is &s;ufficient. The whin&s;tone &s;ometimes re&s;i&s;ts the harde&s;t-tempered &s;teel, and can &s;carce be wrought upon.</P></NOTE>, either altogether, if there be convenience, or by pieces, when a key is u&s;ed to keep the rods from dropping down into the hole, and being either lo&s;t, or re|coverable only with great labour. The chi&s;el is &s;crewed off, and the wimple or &s;coop put on. This being put down brings up afterwards the du&s;t or pulveri&s;ed matter of the &s;tratum, through which the chi&s;el has cut, and &s;hews as well what kind of matter they are boring in as the exact depth thereof.</P>
<P>The &s;kilful workmen, however, feel ea&s;ily, and di&s;tingui&s;h the &s;orts of &s;trata they are upon by the difficulty or facility with which they advance downwards. The prin|cipal part of the borer's art depends on keeping the hole clean, and ob&s;erving every variation of the &s;trata with care and attention.</P>
<P><PB N="679" REF="691">By the wetne&s;s of the rods they know when any feeder of water is pricked, and by their falling down as it were without any labour, when they are upon an old wa&s;te or colliery that has been wrought before.</P>
<P>This is an art of the utmo&s;t u&s;e and importance in collieries; for by boring previou&s;ly to the &s;inking of a pit, the owner procures mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential data whereon to proceed, being informed before hand of the nature of the earth, minerals and waters through which he has to pa&s;s, and knowing to an inch or &s;o how deep his coal lies, as well as its quality, and the thickne&s;s of the &s;tratum or bed<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Vide Encyclopaedia, Edinburgh, quarto, in voce "Coalieries;" al&s;o The Complete Collier.</NOTE>. The boring notes<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Wallis's Hi&s;tory of Northumberland, vol. i. p. 129.</NOTE> of collieries are the grand arcana of the coal trade, and &s;ecrets which the owners by no means chu&s;e to di&s;cover to the prying eyes of the curious philo&s;opher.</P>
<P>No lea&s;e is taken of any ground which has not previou&s;ly been explored by boring. The boring being completed, in order to win the coals, they afterwards &s;ink what is called the &s;haft<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">sceaft Sagitta. Cu&s;pis, Lignum, teres. Ben&s;on's Anglo-Saxon Vocabulary.</NOTE> of the pit, i. e. the narrow, round, perpendicular pa&s;&s;age into the mine</P>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>DIP AND RISE OF THE STRATA OF COAL.</HEAD>
<P>BY the &s;inking of the &s;haft is opened out a communication with the bed of the coal. The &s;trata of this fo&s;&s;il are &s;eldom or never found to lie in a true horizontal &s;ituation, but generally have an inclination or de&s;cent, called the dip<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot"><P>In all places where the &s;trata lie regular, they are divided and &s;ubdivided, &amp;c. Though it is often otherwi&s;e; for their regularity is frequently interrupted, and the &s;trata broken and di&s;ordered by &s;undry cha&s;ms, breaches or fi&s;&s;ures, which are differently denominated according to their various dimen&s;ions, and the matters with which they are filled, viz. dikes, hitches, and troubles.</P>
<P>Dikes are the large&s;t kind of fi&s;&s;ures; they &s;eem to be nothing but a cr$$k or breach of the &s;olid &s;trata, occa&s;ioned by one part of them being broken away and fallen from the other. They generally run in $ &s;traight line tor a con&s;iderable length, and penetrate from the &s;urface to the greate&s;t depth ever yet tried, in a direction &s;ometimes perpendicular to the horizon, and &s;ometimes obliquely. The &s;ame kinds of &s;trata are found lying upon each other in the &s;ame order, but the whole of them greatly elevated or depre&s;&s;ed, on the one &s;ide of the dike as on the other. The&s;e fi&s;&s;ures are &s;ometimes two or three feet wide, and &s;ometimes many fathoms. If the fi&s;&s;ure or dike be of any con&s;iderable width, it is g$nerally filled with heterogeneous matter, different from that of the &s;olid &s;trata on each &s;ide of it.

<P>The &s;trata are generally found lying upon each other in the &s;ame order on one &s;ide of the dike as on the other, as mentioned above, and nearly of the &s;ame thickne&s;&s;es, appearing to have been originally a continua|tion of the &s;ame regular &s;trata, and the dike only a breach by &s;ome later accident, perpendicularly or ob|liquely down through them, by which one part is removed to a &s;mall di&s;tance, and depre&s;&s;ed to a lower &s;itua|tion than the other.</P>
<P>But this is not the only alteration made in the &s;trata by dikes; for generally, to a con&s;iderable di&s;tance on each &s;ide of the dike, all the &s;trata are in a kind of &s;hattered condition, very tender, ea&s;ily pervious to water, and deba&s;ed greatly in their quality, and their inclination to the horizon often altered.</P>
<P>Troubles may be denominated dikes or the &s;malle&s;t degree; for they are not a real breach, but only an approach towards it which has not taken a full effect. The &s;trata are generally altered by a trouble, from their regular &s;ite to a different po&s;ition. When the regular cour&s;e of the &s;trata is nearly level, a trouble will cau&s;e a &s;udden and con&s;iderable a&s;cent or de&s;cent: where they have in their regular &s;ituation a certain de|gree of a&s;cent or de&s;cent, a trouble either increa&s;eth it, or alters it to a contrary po&s;ition; and a trouble has the&s;e effects upon the &s;trata in common with dikes, that it greatly deba&s;eth them from their original quality; the partings are &s;eparated, the backs and cutters disjoined, and their regularity di&s;ordered. The original cubic and pri&s;matic figures of which the &s;trata were compo&s;ed, are broken, and the di&s;location filled with heterogeneous matter; and the whole &s;trata are reduced to a fo&s;ter and more friable &s;tate.</P>

Sometimes there are fi&s;&s;ures or interruptions of &s;ome con&s;ider|able quantities, being coaled &s;trata, &s;tone and other materials, jumbled together: This proves that the&s;e has been &s;uch a partial di&s;ruption of the &s;trata of the earth, as we all along &s;uppo&s;e was effected by the De|luge, but not &s;uch a hotch-potch or total mixture and confu&s;ion as others would pretend."</P>
<P>Pennant, in his Tour, vol. ii. p. 56, &s;peaking of the mines at Whitehaven, &s;ays, "The beds of coal are nine or ten feet thick, and dip to the we&s;t one yard in eight.

It is only inflammable &s;ub&s;tance, &s;o volatile that it is always in form of vapour, and is called fire damp. By its obviours qualities it is di&s;|gui&s;hed from another damp, which is much more common, and has the power of extingui&s;hing flame, a&s;|&s;i&s;ting of fixed air.</P>
<P>The fire damp i&s;&s;ues out of crevices, m$ves it&s;elf with the air of the mine, and when thus mined is $$ dangerous&mdash;from experiments an inflammable &s;ub&s;tance.

This inflammable vapour then, when it ru&s;h$$ out, will float to the upper part of the $ui$$, and lodge in any little cavity it may meet with, ju&s;t water does on the &s;urface of the earth, and will not mix with the &s;urrounding, air, except by means of a little agitation. When it appears in this manner in mi$$s where it is not very cop ous, the miners &s;et fire to it by means or a candle and a long &s;tring; but it is g$$ rally mo&s;t convenient to get quit of it by leading a long wide pipe from the vapour to the external air, and there making at terminate in the a&s;h-pit of a f$rnace. It this be clo&s;e in all other places, there will be a con&s;tant draught of the vapour from the inferior parts of the mine to $$ed the fire.

An admirable and mo&s;t forcible way to drive up water by fire, not by drawing or &s;ucking it upwards, for that mu&s;t be, as the philo&s;opher calleth it, "intra &s;phaeram activitatis," which is but at &s;uch a di&s;tance. But this way hath no bounder, it the ve&s;&s;els be &s;trong enough: for I have taken a piece of a whole cannon, whereof the end was bur&s;t, and filled it three quarters full of water, &s;topping and &s;crewing up the broken end, as all&s; the touch-hole; and making a con&s;tant fire under it, within twenty-four hours it bur&s;t, and made a great crack: &s;o that having a way to make my ve&s;&s;els, &s;o that they are &s;trengthened by the force within them, and the one to fill after the other.

<P>In the Univer&s;al Magazine for September, 1747, is a plate and account of the engine to rai&s;e waters by fire. After mentioning the Marquis of Worce&s;ter's invention of it about A. D. 1663, the writer &s;ays, it by dormant till Captain Savery, Tr$a&s;urer to the Sic and Wounded Office, having read the Marquis's book, took the him, and pretended to find out this &s;ecret of nature by &s;uch chance as upon experiment is found could not give him any $word$ idea; and to become the credit thereof to him&s;elf, he bought up and $urn$ all the Marquis's books he could find. Thus Captain Savory claimed the credit of this machine to him&s;elf, and obtained a patient for the &s;ole $$$$ting thereof, as I have been told. The Captain $$$de a gr$$t many experiments to bring this machine to perfection and erected &s;everal with good &s;ucce&s;s on gentlemen's &s;$ats for private u&s;e, but he could never bring it to bear for working of coal pi$ of mine$ $word$ becau&s;e &s;uch a work required a &s;team too dangerou&s;ly &s;trong to be attempted in his way.

<P>I know not what kind of engines the following were, which are d&s;cribed in the Life of Lord Keeper N$rth, of the date of 1676: "The coal-mines in Lumley Park are the greate&s;t in the north, and produce the be&s;t coal. The&s;e collieries had but one drain of water drawn by two engines, one of three &s;tories, the other of two. All the pits for two or three miles together were drained into the&s;e drains.
