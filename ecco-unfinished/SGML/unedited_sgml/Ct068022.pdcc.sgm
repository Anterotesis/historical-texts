<P>_LIFE, as SHAKESPEAR &s;ays, is like a poor Player, and a poor Play|er is like to be a poor Life; nay, any Life, unle&s;s tolerably acted, is like to be a poor one.</P>
<P>THE World's a Stage, Life an ir|regular Drama, our Pa&s;&s;ions are the
<PB N="iv" REF="4">Players, our Sen&s;es the Scenes, and Rea&s;on a drow&s;y Part of the Audi|ence, that cannot, or will not, mind what's performing around him.</P>
<Q><L>Life is but a Joke&mdash;and our Art at the be&s;t,</L>
<L>Is &s;olely in making the mo&s;t of the Je&s;t.</L></Q>
<P>To help the Joke on, you greatly contribute, and I &s;ometimes am al|low'd to play an under Part to you.</P>
<P>LET me not rake up the A&s;hes of the Dead; di&s;turb the <HI>Manes</HI> of the Great decea&s;ed, or disfurni&s;h the Trophies of ancient Law-Givers, to make a Panegyric on your Lord Chief Ju&s;tice&s;hip. Come ye Sons of &s;terling Humour, <HI>Lucian, Rablais, Cervantes,</HI> and THOU, the mo&s;t
<PB N="v" REF="5">witty, mo&s;t worthy of all, immortal <HI>SWIFT,</HI> in&s;pire me. Teach me to paint THEE and thy Court&mdash;It will not be&mdash;not one Ray of all their mighty Power will they beam on me&mdash;unhappy Ru&s;tic.</P>
<P>SUFFER me then, as Your <HI>At|torney-General,</HI> to addre&s;s You, and offer a Ca&s;e to Your Lord&s;hip, which comes immediately under Your Ju|ri&s;diction.</P>
<P>IT is the whole Art and My&s;tery of HUM-BUGGING. This is a very ancient Science, and, as <HI>Maimonedes</HI> reports in the <HI>Mun&s;ter</HI> MSS. was fir&s;t taught by the <HI>Aegyp|tians.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Hermes Tri&s;megi&s;tus,</HI> and <HI>Zoro|a&s;ter,</HI> were <HI>Hieroglyphical Hummers.</HI></P>
<PB N="vi" REF="6">
<P>THE fir&s;t found out the <HI>Philo&s;opher's Stone,</HI> the other invented <HI>Oracles.</HI></P>
<P>IT is very difficult to come to a right Account of tho&s;e dark and fa|bulous Ages. The fir&s;t Authors of An|tiquity to be depended upon for their Veracity, are, <HI>Herodotus, Aelian, Pliny</HI> the <HI>Naturali&s;t,</HI> and Sir <HI>John Man|devile.</HI></P>
<P>IN the Life of <HI>Ther&s;ites, Herodo|tus</HI> gives us an Account of a very re|markable <HI>Hum.</HI> It was called, <HI>The Trojan Hor&s;e;</HI> though &s;ome Authors will tell you it was a <HI>Mare;</HI> others, that it was a <HI>Cow;</HI> and that the Model of it being pre&s;erved in the <HI>Cretan Mu&s;aeum,</HI> gave <HI>Daedalus</HI> the Hint for carrying on the Intrigue for Madam <HI>Pa&s;iphaae</HI> with <HI>Europa</HI>'s <HI>Gal|loway.</HI></P>
<PB N="vii" REF="7">
<P><HI>ULYSSES</HI> we may &s;et down as a tolerable <HI>Hummer; vide</HI> the Re|ports, Ca&s;es, and Tryals, of <HI>Rhe&s;us, Achilles, Palamedes, Philoctetes, Ajax, Circe, Calip&s;o,</HI> &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>
<P>LADY <HI>Penelope,</HI> his Spou&s;e, was not a Jot behind Hand with him. She carried on a good Sort of a <HI>Joke</HI> on her Side the Water. Ah, my LORD, that undoing at <HI>Night</HI> what has been done in the <HI>Day,</HI> is too of|ten the Ca&s;e at pre&s;ent with mo&s;t of the Male and Female De&s;cendants from <HI>Adam.</HI></P>
<P>HER Web is a good Emblem of the Morning Re&s;olves of Sobriety, and the Evening Temptations to break them.</P>
<PB N="viii" REF="8">
<P>IN vain may we rea&s;on di&s;pa&s;&s;i|onately, declare for Ab&s;tinence and good Hours. It is all but a Web. At Night, Claret and good Company unravel all our Re&s;olutions.</P>
<P>AND Faith, <HI>entre nous,</HI> I think we are in the Right of it. Time will not &s;tay for us, why &s;hould we &s;tay for Time. The future Moments are &s;carcely worth reflecting on, the pa&s;t too painful to remember, and the pre&s;ent only fit for Laughter. Let us then &s;ocially &s;acrifice to <HI>Mirth</HI> and <HI>true Humour:</HI> As in the ancient Days of Plea&s;antry our Forefathers ta&s;ted the Sweets of joyful Society.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Spirit of Ho&s;pitality</HI> pre|&s;ided at their Tables; <HI>Wit</HI> and <HI>good Humour</HI> were their Companions; and <HI>Fancy</HI> furni&s;h'd out the Fea&s;t.</P>
<PB N="ix" REF="9">
<P>But to return to my Hi&s;tory.</P>
<P><HI>ALEXANDER the Great</HI> was a famous <HI>Hummer;</HI> he per&s;uaded the <HI>Macedonians</HI> into a Belief he was the Son of <HI>Jupiter;</HI> but he carried the Joke rather too far, for he be|lieved it him&s;elf at la&s;t; &s;o may pro|perly be &s;aid to be <HI>&s;elf-hum'd:</HI> Like the Mi&s;er who pick'd his own Pocket.</P>
<P><HI>ALCIBIADES</HI> was certainly a very great Ma&s;ter of this Science: But why &s;hould I di&s;turb the tawny Mold of the&s;e Du&s;t-converted Heroes; not but there were &s;ome very pretty Fellows formerly to be &s;ure. For In|&s;tance;</P>
<P><HI>SCIPIO</HI> was a very mode&s;t Fel|low; yet I take <HI>Laelius</HI> to be but a led <HI>Captain,</HI> and <HI>Socrates</HI> little better than a <HI>Putt: Demo&s;thenes</HI> &s;aid a great
<PB N="x" REF="10">many good Things, and <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> had certainly &s;omething very &s;mart about him: <HI>Mark Anthony</HI> was a very <HI>jemmy Fellow,</HI> and <HI>Cleopatra</HI> quite the Thing to be &s;ure; <HI>Lucretia</HI> was a Fright, and <HI>Virginius</HI> a Bea&s;t of a Fellow: <HI>Virgil</HI> had a good deal of the Gentle|man about him, and <HI>Horace</HI> was a very hone&s;t Fellow: <HI>Ovid</HI> was a good Woman's Man, and <HI>Cicero</HI> tolerable Company: But what's all this to the Purpo&s;e, if the fine Fellows of for|mer Ages were alive now, they would be looked on little better than <HI>Tra|montanes.</HI></P>
<P>FOR pray, what Figure would <HI>Phocion</HI> cut in a <HI>Pump-Room,</HI> or how would <HI>Hannibal</HI> behave in a <HI>Minuet. Uly&s;&s;es</HI> might do &s;omething at <HI>Brough|ton</HI>'s perhaps, but what would become of <HI>Ari&s;tides</HI> at a <HI>Ma&s;querade,</HI> or who
<PB N="xi" REF="11">would take <HI>Epaminondas</HI> for a Partner at a <HI>Card-Table?</HI></P>
<P>IT is not by &s;laying of Mon&s;ters, founding of Empires, or being Tem|pe&s;t-to&s;s'd for half a Score Years, we now become great. The Sy&s;tem of Life is entirely altered. If we mu&s;t give Battle, what can we better kill than out Time. And if we would do any Thing for Po&s;terity, we may endeavour to increa&s;e the In|fant Inhabitants of the <HI>Foundling-Ho&s;pital;</HI> and as to encountring Fa|tigues, the rule Jolts of a Hackney-Coach over the rough irregular Streets, and broken Pavement, is enough to di&s;|compo&s;e the Oeconomy of both Limbs and Linnen of the prettie&s;t Fellow ex|i&s;ting.</P>
<P>I BEG Pardon for this Digre&s;&s;ion, and &s;hall leave the Ancients to their
<PB N="xii" REF="12">Commentators, and look into our own Times, &s;ee how far this <HI>Hum|bugg,</HI> (or <HI>Humbuzz,</HI> as <HI>Ben John|&s;on</HI> calls it:) I &s;ay, &s;ee how far it has &s;pread.</P>
<P>ITS Etymology is difficult to a&s;cer|tain; though <HI>Machaon,</HI> in his <HI>Tu&s;can</HI> Treati&s;e upon <HI>Mu&s;cular Motion,</HI> de|rives it from the Sounds which i&s;&s;ued from the No&s;trils of the <HI>Phoenician Fanatics,</HI> when they pretended to un|dergo the Operation of the Spirit. No bad <HI>Hum</HI> that, nor badly propagated &s;ince. It became general in <HI>Cromwel</HI>'s Time, who mu&s;t be allowed a <HI>Hero in Humming.</HI></P>
<P>IN the merry Days of King <HI>Charles</HI> the Second, all the&s;e formal Fa&s;hions were bani&s;h'd, and a new Branch of this Science was introduced by <HI>Jack
<PB N="xiii" REF="13">Bite</HI> and Mi&s;s <HI>Quibble,</HI> who lived very hand&s;omely at the Court by &s;elling Bargains.</P>
<P>THEY have continued, Courtiers-like, in E&s;teem and out, as Caprice and Con&s;titution commanded, till a younger Brother, tired of <HI>Levee</HI> De|pendance, &s;truck a bold Stroke, and &s;et up for him&s;elf.&mdash;The Story is thus:</P>
<P>YOUNG HUMM, the Buck I &s;peak of, is a collateral De&s;cendant from the Hou&s;e of <HI>Legend:</HI> A long Time he had been put to his Shifts, rambling about &s;ometimes as a <HI>Gip&s;y,</HI> a <HI>Mounte|bank Doctor,</HI> a <HI>Methodi&s;t Preacher,</HI> an <HI>Italian Count,</HI> a <HI>Fortune Hunter,</HI> a <HI>decay'd Gentleman,</HI> an <HI>Oculi&s;t,</HI> &amp;c. At la&s;t he &s;truck at the Stage, and re|&s;olved to commence <HI>Actor.</HI> He made his fir&s;t Appearance in the little
<PB N="xiv" REF="14">Theatre in the <HI>Haymarket,</HI> in the Character of a <HI>Bottle Conjurer.</HI></P>
<P>WHAT became of him afterwards I could never learn, till by the late Adverti&s;ement for <HI>Macklin</HI>'s Benefit, we find that <HI>Actor</HI> has employed him to fill his Hou&s;e for him.</P>
<P>I WISH Your Lord&s;hip would lay a Fine on all &s;uch Pretenders to Wit, Science, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> That no Pedlar in Poetry, no plagiary Humouri&s;t, no uncla&s;&s;i|cal Critic, &s;hall have Liberty to vend his Dregs for true Doctrine.</P>
<P>FOR my own Part, I &s;hall, as Your <HI>Attorney-General,</HI> prefer a Bill again&s;t all Pretenders to <HI>Hum,</HI> who dare practi&s;e without being able to &s;hew a &s;en&s;ible Diploma; or, at lea&s;t a De|putation from the Court of good Hu|mour.</P>
<PB N="xv" REF="15">
<P>THAT is the Court which all Men ought to practi&s;e in, e&s;pecially all tho&s;e who with natural or acquired Qualifications are capable of taking upon them the Character of fine Com|panions.</P>
<P>WITH Submi&s;&s;ion to Your Lord|&s;hip's Judgment, I cannot help giving it as my Opinion, that however Fame-worthy Wit, Wi&s;dom, and Learning are, Good-nature is much their &s;u|perior.</P>
<P>MY e&s;teeming Good-nature before Wit, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> may be thought in me to proceed from the common Vice of railing at what I cannot enjoy.</P>
<P>I ALLOW it; yet mu&s;t beg Leave to ob&s;erve, that although Wit is very plea&s;ing, it is &s;ometimes as hurtful; it often rai&s;es up a Foe, &s;eldom makes a Friend.</P>
<PB N="xvi" REF="16">
<P>A MAN of Wit and Humour may ju&s;tly be compared to a beautiful Girl without a Fortune; they both attract many Admirers, who pay &s;trong Court for Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; but it is momentary Self-Gratification only they aim at. After, long Enjoyment blunts the Edge of Appetite, and Familiarity renders every wi&s;h'd-for Perfection common. Satiety &s;ucceeds De&s;ire, and the former Lovers are no longer anxious after Enjoyment. What is then to become of tho&s;e Victims to Frolic? The Girl langui&s;hes out her Di&s;ea&s;e-&s;horten'd Days in an Ho&s;pi|tal; and the Man of Wit, broken-hearted, peri&s;hes in Goal, under the mi&s;erable Reflections of mi&s;pent Time and ba&s;ele&s;s Friend&s;hips.</P>
<P>BUT, Mr. SPARKS, give me Leave &s;eriou&s;ly to addre&s;s you, and in this
<PB N="xvii" REF="17">public Manner declare, That if every one, who likes you as an Actor, was to be a Witne&s;s, like me, of your Be|haviour in private Life, You would, if <HI>po&s;&s;ible,</HI> be much more re&s;pected than You are at pre&s;ent. You are very plea&s;ing as an Actor, highly di|verting as a Companion, but more Prai&s;e-worthy as <HI>a Man.</HI> I know You to be a &s;en&s;ible Friend, an indul|gent Father, and an affectionate Hu&s;|band. The&s;e are Qualities none can exceed, few come up to. When the Sallies of Wit and Humour &s;hall de|cay, when the Grape's enlivening Juice becomes ta&s;tele&s;s, and when the be&s;t Company cea&s;es to be entertaining, this Character &s;hall remain. Then in Your la&s;t, in Your late&s;t Moments, &s;hall You enjoy the &s;ecret Satisfaction of an hone&s;t well-&s;pent Life.</P>
<PB N="xviii" REF="18">
<P>LONG may tho&s;e Moments be di&s;tant.</P>
<P>I HAVE almo&s;t thought my&s;elf into a Fit of the Vapours, and, I believe, at this pre&s;ent Reading, You are not much better; therefore, if Your Lord|&s;hip plea&s;es, I'll call a new Cau&s;e, and con&s;ider of &mdash; what &mdash; why my&s;elf, tho' that is a Topic hardly worth Con|&s;ideration, and what, indeed, I am very unfit for.</P>
<P>METHINKS &s;ome ha&s;ty Readers may cry out, What is all this about, this <HI>Humdrum?</HI> What a Plague does this <HI>Stevens</HI> trouble us with him&s;elf and &s;uch Stuff? Why, that's true, faith, I can plead nothing in Defence of this Paper-wa&s;ting Practice, this CACOETHES SCRIBENDI, (there's Learn|ing, my Lord) I &s;ay, I can plead no|thing
<PB N="xix" REF="19">in Defence of my&s;elf but Idle|ne&s;s and the Fa&s;hion; and if they don't acquit me&mdash;why I'm undone, that's all.</P>
<P>YOU &s;ay in Your EPILOGUE, that the Town is the Jury: To them therefore I &s;ubmit; and if any Per|formance of mine, either as an Author, or Actor, can amu&s;e them, my End is an&s;wered, my Labour paid: But if, on the Contrary, I'm condemned, why, Silk-worm like, I'll wrap my&s;elf up in my own Labours, and do&s;e out the re&s;t of my Days in Dirt and De&s;pair; a mi&s;erable <HI>Momento</HI> to all wou'd-be Wits my Cotemporaries.</P>
<P>IT is very hard to be witty, and a melancholy Thing, very melancholy indeed, when we want to arrive at Wit: And Dulne&s;s (fa&s;t Friend to us
<PB N="xx" REF="20">Rhime-makers) claps an Embargo on our Under&s;tandings. But though I can't come at Wit, I may at Sincerity; and, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of that, dare &s;ay, if a &s;ingle Page in the following Burle&s;que meets with Approbation from the Readers of Ta&s;te in this Metropolis, I &s;hall from thenceforth begin to have a good Opinion of a certain Son of Indi&s;cretion, called,</P>

<HEAD>PREFACE TO THE Second ACT.</HEAD>
<P>IN this Second Part, the Reader, if he will give him&s;elf the Trouble of looking over them, will find &s;ome Notes, which &s;eem as if de&s;ign'd to drole on Mr. <HI>War|burton</HI>'s Ob&s;ervations. They were &s;o. For though Mr. <HI>Warburton</HI> is uni|ver&s;al in Learning, he is not quite &s;o perfect in Judgment and Ta&s;te; un|le&s;s, like the great Mr. <HI>Addi&s;on,</HI> he
<PB N="70" REF="70">&s;uffers Prejudice to get the better of both.</P>
<P>EVERY Part of <HI>Grammar</HI> he is Ma&s;ter of, yet there is one Part of Speech he is &s;ometimes deficient in; which is, <HI>Good Manners.</HI> This, I think, is obvious to every Reader, who will peru&s;e his Notes on SHAKE|SPEAR; for he has, out of the Fulne&s;s of his Spleen, been pleas'd to lead the <HI>Players</HI> with &s;everal gro&s;s, unde&s;erved Epithets, throughout his Annotations.</P>
<P>FOR, whenever any Interpolation, by an ignorant Tran&s;criber, has been foi&s;ted into the Text, he is not con|tent with ca&s;ting the Odium on the Players, but immediately adds the Epithets, <HI>fooli&s;h, infamous, imperti|nent,</HI> or <HI>prophane.</HI> Certainly he mu&s;t forget SHAKFSPEAR was a <HI>Player;</HI> if he does not, in regard to &s;o great a
<PB N="71" REF="71">Genius, he might treat his Brethren with a little more Lenity.</P>
<P>THE U&s;age the Actors have re|ceived from him, urged me,
<Q><L>The meane&s;t in Renown;</L>
<L>The poore&s;t Trifler of the Town,</L></Q>
to twirl a Sling again&s;t this <HI>Cla&s;&s;ical Goliah;</HI> for, I think, every Per&s;on belonging to the Theatres, has a Right to treat that Man with Ridicule, who endeavours to throw them into Con|tempt.</P>
<P>LIKE <HI>Scaliger,</HI> he quits the Gen|tleman when he takes up the Critic, and thinks a Multitude of Learning will attone for an Abundance of Rudene&s;s; but, with Submi&s;&s;ion to his Scholar&s;hip, Good-nature is as far before great Learning, as the Actions
<PB N="72" REF="72">of the Heart to the Intentions of the Head.</P>
