<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT TO The fir&s;t publication of this <HI>Epi&s;tle.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THIS paper is a &s;ort of bill of complaint, be|gun many years &s;ince, and drawn up by &s;natches, as the &s;everal occa&s;ions offered. I had no thoughts of publi&s;hing it, till it plea&s;ed &s;ome Per&s;ons of Rank and Fortune [the Authors of <HI>Ver&s;es to the Imitator of Horace,</HI> and of an <HI>Epi&s;tle to a Doctor of Di|vinity from a Nobleman at Hampton Court]</HI> to attack, in a very extraordinary manner, not only my Writings (of which, being public, the Public is judge) but my <HI>Per|&s;on, Morals,</HI> and <HI>Family,</HI> whereof, to tho&s;e who know me not, a truer information may be requi&s;ite. Being divided between the nece&s;&s;ity to &s;ay &s;omething of <HI>my|&s;elf,</HI> and my own lazine&s;s to undertake &s;o awkward a ta&s;k, I thought it the &s;horte&s;t way to put the la&s;t hand to this Epi&s;tle. If it have any thing plea&s;ing, it will be that by which I am mo&s;t de&s;irous to plea&s;e, the <HI>Truth</HI> and the <HI>Sentiment;</HI> and if any thing offen&s;ive, it will be only to tho&s;e I am lea&s;t &s;orry to offend&punc; <HI>the vicious</HI> or <HI>the ungenerous.</HI></P>
<P>Many will know their own pictures in it, there be|ing not a circum&s;tance but what is true; but I have,
<PB N="4" REF="6">
for the mo&s;t part, &s;pared their <HI>Names,</HI> and they may e&s;cape being laughed at, if they plea&s;e.</P>
<P>I would have &s;ome of them know, it was owing to the reque&s;t of the learned and candid Friend to whom it is in&s;cribed, that I make not as free u&s;e of theirs as they have done of mine. However, I &s;hall have this advantage, and honour, on my &s;ide, that whereas, by their proceeding, any abu&s;e may be directed at any man, no injury can po&s;&s;ibly be done by mine, &s;ince a name|le&s;s Character can never be found out, but by its <HI>truth</HI> and <HI>likene&s;s.</HI> <BIBL>P.</BIBL></P>

<HEAD>EPISTLE TO Dr. ARBUTHNOT.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">An Apology for him&s;elf and his Writings.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Ep. to Dr. Arbuthnot.]</HI> AT the time of publi&s;hing this Epi&s;tle, the Poet's patience was quite exhau&s;ted by the endle&s;s impertinence of Poeta&s;ters of all ranks and conditions; as well tho&s;e who courted his favour, as tho&s;e who envied his reputation. So that now he had re&s;olved to quit his hands of both together, by the publication of a DUNCIAD. This de&s;ign he commu|nicated to his excellent Friend Dr. ARBUTHNOT, who, although as a man of Wit and Learning he might not have been di&s;|plea&s;ed to &s;ee their common injuries revenged on this pernicious Tribe; yet, as our Author's Friend and Phy&s;ician, was&s;olicitous of his ea&s;e and health; and therefore unwilling he &s;hould pro|voke &s;o large and powerful a party.</P>
<P>Their difference of opinion, in this matter, gives occa&s;ion to the following <HI>Dialogue.</HI> Where, in a natural and familiar detail of all his Provocations, both from flatterers and &s;landerers, our Author has artfully interwoven an Apology for his <HI>moral</HI> and <HI>poetic</HI> Character.</P>
<P>For after having told his ca&s;e, and humourou&s;ly applied to his Phy&s;ician in the manner one would a&s;k for a Receipt to kill Vermin, he &s;trait goes on, in the common Character of A&s;kers of advice, to tell his Doctor that he had already taken his party, and determined of his remedy. But u&s;ing a preamble, and in|troducing it (in the way of Poets) with a Simile, in which he names <HI>Kings, Queens, and Mini&s;ters of State,</HI> his Friend takes the alarm, begs him to forbear, to &s;tick to his &s;ubject, and to be ea&s;y under &s;o common a calamity.</P>
<P>To make &s;o light of his di&s;a&s;ter provokes the Poet: he breaks the thread of his di&s;cour&s;e, which was to lead his Friend gently, and by degrees, into his project; and abruptly tells him the ap|plication of his Simile, at once,
<Q><L>Out with it, <HI>Dunciad!</HI> let the &s;ecret pa&s;s, &amp;c.</L></Q>
<PB N="6" REF="8">
But recollecting the humanity and tenderne&s;s of his Friend, which, he apprehends, might be a little &s;hocked at the apparent &s;everity of &s;uch a proceeding, he a&s;&s;ures him, that his good&punc;na|ture is alarmed without a cau&s;e, for that nothing has le&s;s feeling than this &s;ort of Offenders; which he illu&s;trates in the Examples of a <HI>damn'd Poet,</HI> a <HI>detected Slanderer,</HI> a <HI>Table-Para&s;ite,</HI> a <HI>Church-Buffo$n,</HI> and a <HI>Party-Writer</HI> [from &vers; 1 to 100.]</P>
<P>But, in this enumeration, coming again to <HI>Names,</HI> his Friend once more &s;tops him, and bids him con&s;ider what ho&s;tilities this general attack will &s;et on &s;oot. So much the better, replies the Poet; for, con&s;idering <HI>the &s;trong antipathy of bad to good,</HI> enemies they will always be, either open or &s;ecret: and it admits of no que&s;tion, but a Slanderer is le&s;s hurtful than a Flatterer. For, &s;ays he (in a plea&s;ant Simile addre&s;&s;ed to his Friend's profe&s;&s;ion)
<Q><L>Of all mad creatures, if the learn'd are right,</L>
<L>It is the &s;laver kills, and not the bite.</L></Q>
And how abject and exce&s;&s;ive the flattery of the&s;e creatures was, he &s;hews, by ob&s;erving, that they prai&s;ed him even for his in&s;irmities; his bad health, and his inconvenient &s;hape [&vers; 100 to 125.]</P>
<P>But &s;till it might be &s;aid, that if he could bear this evil of Author&s;hip no better, he &s;hould not have wrote at all. To this he an&s;wers, by lamenting the natural bent of his di&s;po&s;ition, which, from his very birth, had drawn him &s;o &s;trongly towards <HI>Poetry,</HI> as if it were in execution of &s;ome &s;ecret decree of Heaven for crimes unknown. But though he offended in becoming an Author, he offended in nothing el&s;e. For his early ver&s;es were perfectly innocent and harmle&s;s,
<Q><L>Like gentle Fanny's was my flowing theme,</L>
<L>A painted mi&s;tre&s;s, or a purling &s;tream.</L></Q>
Yet even then, he tells us, two enraged and hungry Critics fell upon him, without the lea&s;t provocation. But this might have been borne, as the common lot of di&s;tinction. But it was <HI>his</HI> peculiar i$l-fortune to create a Jealou&s;y in One, whom not only many good offices done by our Author to him and his friends, but a &s;imilitude of genius and &s;tudies might have inclined to a reciprocal affection and &s;upport. On the contrary, that other|wi&s;e amiable Per&s;on, being, by nature, timorous and &s;u&s;picious; by education a party-man; and, by the circum&s;tances of fortune, be&s;et with flatterers and pick-thanks; regarded our Author as his Rival, &s;et up by a contrary Faction, with views de&s;tructive of public liberty, and his friends reputation. And all this, with as
<PB N="7" REF="9">
little provocation from Mr. Pope's conduct in his poetic, as in his civil character.</P>
<P>For though he had got a Name (the reputation of which he agreeably rallies in the de&s;cription he gives of it) yet he never, even when mo&s;t in fa&s;hion, &s;et up for a Patron, or a Dictator among&s;t the Wits; but &s;till kept in his u&s;ual privacy; leaving <HI>the whole Ca&s;talian &s;tate,</HI> as he calls it, to a Mock-Mecenas, whom he next de&s;cribes [&vers; 125 to 261.]</P>
<P>And, &s;truck with the &s;en&s;e of that dignity and felicity in&s;epar|able from the character of a true Poet, he breaks out into a pa&s;&s;ionate vow for a continuance of the full Liberty attendant on it. And to &s;hew how well he de&s;erves it, and how &s;afely he might be tru&s;ted with it, he concludes his wi&s;h with a de&s;cription of his temper and di&s;po&s;ition [&vers; 261 to 271.]</P>
<P>This naturally leads him to complain of his Friends, when they con&s;ider him in no other view than that of an <HI>Author:</HI> as if he had neither the &s;ame right to the enjoyments of life, the &s;ame concern for his highe&s;t intere&s;ts, or the &s;ame di&s;po&s;itions of benevolence, with other people.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, he now admoni&s;hes them, in his turn, that they do not con&s;ider to what they expo&s;e him, when they urge him to write on; namely, to the <HI>&s;u&s;picions</HI> and the <HI>di&s;plea&s;ure</HI> of a Court; who are made to believe, he is always writing; or at lea&s;t to the fooli&s;h <HI>critici&s;ms</HI> of court &s;ycophants, who pretend to find him, by his &s;tyle, in the immoral libels of every idle &s;cribler: though he, in the mean time, be &s;o far from countenancing &s;uch worthle&s;s tra&s;h in others, that he would be ready to execrate even his own be&s;t vein of poetry, if made at the expence of Truth or Innocence.</P>
<LG>
<L>Cur&s;t be the ver&s;e, how well &s;o e'er it flow,</L>
<L>That tends to make one worthy man my foe;</L>
<L>Give Virtue &s;candal, Innocence a fear,</L>
<L>Or from the &s;oft-ey'd virgin &s;teal a tear.</L>
</LG>
<P>(Sentiments, which no efforts of genius, without the concur|rence of the heart, could have expre&s;&s;ed in &s;trains &s;o exqui&s;itely &s;ublime) that the &s;ole object of his re&s;entment was <HI>vice</HI> and <HI>ba&s;ene&s;s.</HI> In the detection of which, he artfully takes occa&s;ion to &s;peak of <HI>that</HI> by which he him&s;elf had been injured and of|fended: and concludes with the character of one who had wantonly outraged him, and in the mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible manner [&vers; 271 to 334.]</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="10">
And here, moved again with fre&s;h indignation at his &s;lan|derers, he takes the advice of Horace, <HI>&s;ume &s;uperbiam qua$&s;itam meritis,</HI> and draws a fine picture of his moral and poetic conduct through life. In which he &s;hews that not <HI>fame,</HI> but VIRTUE was the con&s;tant object of his ambition: that for this he oppo&s;ed him&s;elf to all the violence of Cabals, and the treacheries of Courts: the various iniquities of which having di&s;tinctly &s;peci|fied, he &s;ums them up in that mo&s;t atrocious and &s;en&s;ible of all, [&vers; 334 to 359]</P>
<LG>
<L>The whi&s;per, that to greatne&s;s &s;till too near,</L>
<L>Perhaps yet vibrates on his <HI>SOV'REIGN'S</HI> ear.</L>
<L>Welcome for thee, fair <HI>Virtue!</HI> all the pa&s;t:</L>
<L>For thee, fair <HI>Virtue!</HI> welcome ev'n the la&s;t.</L>
</LG>
<P>But here again his Friend interrupts the &s;trains of his divine enthu&s;ia&s;m, and de&s;ires him to clear up an objection made to his conduct, at Court. "That it was inhumane to in&s;ult the Poor, "and ill-breeding to affront the Great." To which he replies, That indeed, in his pur&s;uit of <HI>Vice,</HI> he rarely con&s;idered how Knavery was circum&s;tanced; but followed it, with his Vengeance, indifferently, whether it led to the Pillory, or the Drawing-Room [&vers; 359 to 368.]</P>
<P>But le&s;t this &s;hould give his Reader the idea of a &s;avage in|tractable Virtue, which could bear with nothing, and would pardon nothing, he takes to him&s;elf the &s;hame of owning that he was of &s;o ea&s;y a nature, as to be duped by the &s;lendere&s;t ap|pearances, a pretence to <HI>Virtue</HI> in a <HI>witty Woman:</HI> &s;o forgiving, that he had &s;ought out the object of his beneficence in a <HI>per&s;onal Enemy:</HI> &s;o humble, that he had &s;ubmitted to the conver&s;ation of <HI>bad Poets:</HI> and &s;o forbearing, that he had curbed in his re|&s;entment under the mo&s;t &s;hocking of all calumnies, <HI>abu&s;es on his Father and Mother</HI> [&vers; 368 to 388.]</P>
<P>This naturally leads him to give a &s;hort account of their births, fortunes, and di&s;po&s;itions; which ends with the tendere&s;t wi&s;hes for the happine&s;s of his Friend; intermixed with the mo&s;t pathetic de&s;cription of that filial Piety, in the exerci&s;e of which he makes his own happine&s;s to con&s;i&s;t.</P>
<LG>
<L>Me let the tender office long engage</L>

About ten, being at &s;chool at Hide-park-corner, where he was much neglected, and &s;uffered to go to the Comedy with the greater boys, he turned the tran&s;actions of the Iliad into a play, made up of a number of &s;peeches from Ogilby's tran&s;lation, tacked together with ver&s;es of his own. He had the addre&s;s to per&s;uade the upper boys to act it; he even prevailed on the Ma&s;ter's Gardener to re|pre&s;ent Ajax; and contrived to have all the actors dre&s;&s;ed after the pictures in his favourite Ogilby. At twelve he went with

his Father into the Fore&s;t: and then got fir&s;t acquainted with the writings of Waller, Spencer, and Dryden; in the order I have named them. On the fir&s;t &s;ight of Dryden, he found he had what he wanted. His Poems were never out of his hands; they became his model; and from them alone he learnt the whole magic of his ver&s;ification. This year he began an epic Poem, the &s;ame which Bp. Atterbury, long afterwards, per|&s;uaded him to burn. Be&s;ides this, he wrote, in tho&s;e early days, a Comedy and Tragedy, the latter taken from a &s;tory in the Legend of <HI>St. Genevieve.</HI> They both de&s;ervedly underwent the &s;ame fate.

<P>When in the&s;e latter ages, human learning rai&s;ed its head in the We&s;t, and its tail, <HI>verbal critici&s;m,</HI> was, of cour&s;e, to ri&s;e with it; the madne&s;s of Critics &s;oon became &s;o offen&s;ive, that the &s;ober &s;tupidity of the monks might appear the more tolerable evil. <HI>J. Argyropylus,</HI> a mercenary Greek, who came to teach &s;chool in Italy, after the &s;acking of Con&s;tantinople by the Turks,
<PB N="21" REF="24" MS="Y">
u&s;ed to maintain that <HI>Cicero</HI> under&s;tood neither Philo&s;ophy nor Greek: while another of his Countrymen, <HI>J. La&s;caris</HI> by name, threatened to demon&s;trate that <HI>Virgil</HI> was no Poet. Coun|tenanced by &s;uch great examples, a French Critic afterwards un|dertook to prove that <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> did not under&s;tand Greek, nor <HI>Titus Livius,</HI> Latin. It was the &s;ame di&s;cernment of &s;pirit, which has &s;ince di&s;covered that <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> was ignorant of He|brew; and <HI>Era&s;mus</HI> &s;o pitiful a Lingui&s;t, that, <HI>Burman</HI> a&s;&s;ures us, were he now alive, he would not de&s;erve to be put at the head of a country &s;chool. For though time has &s;trip'd the pre|&s;ent race of Pedants of all the real accompli&s;hments of their pre|dece&s;&s;ors, it has conveyed down this &s;pirit to them, unimpaired; it being found much ea&s;ier to ape their manners, than to imitate their &s;cience. However, tho&s;e earlier Ribalds rai&s;ed an appe|tite for the Greek language in the We&s;t: in&s;omuch, that <HI>Her|molaus Barbarus,</HI> a pa&s;&s;ionate admirer of it, and a noted Critic, u&s;ed to boa&s;t, that he had invoked and rai&s;ed the Devil, and puz|zled him into the bargain, about the meaning of the Ari&s;totelian ENTEAEXEIA. Another, whom <HI>Balzac</HI> &s;peaks of, was as eminent for his Revelations: and was wont to &s;ay, that the meaning of &s;uch or &s;uch a ver&s;e, in <HI>Per&s;ius,</HI> no one knew but GOD and him&s;elf. While the celebrated <HI>Pomponius Laetus,</HI> in exce&s;s of Veneration for Antiquity, became a real Pagan, rai&s;ed altars to Romulus, and &s;acrificed to the Gods of Latium: in which he was followed by our countryman, <HI>Baxter,</HI> in every thing, but in the expence of his &s;acrifices.</P>
<P>But if the Greeks cried down <HI>Cicero,</HI> the Italian Critics knew how to &s;upport his credit. Every one has heard of the childi&s;h exce&s;&s;es into which the ambition of being thought CICERONIANS carried the mo&s;t celebrated Italians of this time. They ab&s;tained from reading the Scriptures for fear of &s;poiling their &s;tyle: Cardinal <HI>Bembo</HI> u&s;ed to call the Epi&s;tles of St. Paul by the contemptuous name of <HI>Epi&s;tolaccias, great overgrown Epi&s;tles.</HI> But ERASMUS cured their frenzy in that ma&s;terpiece of good &s;en&s;e, his <HI>Ciceronianus.</HI> For which (in the way Luna|tics treat their Phy&s;icians) the elder <HI>Scaliger</HI> in&s;ulted him with all the brutal fury peculiar to his family and profe&s;&s;ion.</P>

His &s;on <HI>Jo&s;eph,</HI> and <HI>Salma&s;ius</HI> had indeed &s;uch endowments of nature and art, as might have rai&s;ed modern learning to a rival|&s;hip with the ancient? Yet how did they and their adver&s;aries tear and worry one another.

Who, when he was preparing &s;omething of <HI>Julius Scaliger's</HI> for the Pre&s;s, de&s;ired the Author would give him directions concerning his Picture, which was to be &s;et before the book. Who&s;e an&s;wer (as it &s;tands in his col|lection of Letters) is, that if the engraver could collect together the &s;everal graces of Ma&s;&s;ini&s;&s;a, Xenophon, and Plato, he might then be enabled to give the public &s;ome faint and imperfect re|&s;emblance of his Per&s;on. Nor was <HI>Salma&s;ius's</HI> judgment of his own parts le&s;s favourable to him&s;elf; as M. <HI>Colomies</HI> tells the &s;tory.

<HI>Dennis</HI> &s;o brutally attacked the Tragedy of <HI>Cato,</HI> he wrote that humourous piece called <HI>A narrative of his madne&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>Thus things continued till Mr. Pope's growing reputation, and &s;uperior genius in Poetry gave umbrage to his friend's fal&s;e delicacy: and then it was he encouraged Philips and others (&s;ee his Letters) in their clamours again&s;t him as a Tory and Jacobite, who had a&s;&s;i&s;ted in writing the <HI>Examiners;</HI> and, under an affected care for the Government, would have hid, even from him&s;elf, the true grounds of his di&s;gu&s;t. But his jealou&s;y &s;oon broke out, and di&s;covered it&s;elf, fir&s;t to Mr. Pope, and, not long after, to all the world. <HI>The Rape of the Lock</HI> had been written in a very ha&s;ty manner, and printed in a collection of Mi&s;cellanies. The &s;ucce&s;s it met with encouraged the Author to revi&s;e and enlarge it, and give it a more important air, which was done by advancing it into a mock-epic Poem. In order to this it was to have its Machinery; which, by the hap|pie&s;t invention, he took from the <HI>Ro&s;yeru&s;ian</HI> Sy&s;tem. Full of this noble conception, he communicated it to Mr. Addi&s;on, who he imagined would have been equally delighted with the improvement. On the contrary, he had the mortification to have his friend receive it coldly; and more, to advi&s;e him again&s;t any alteration; for that the poem in its original &s;tate was a delicious little thing, and, as he expre&s;&s;ed it, <HI>merum &s;al.</HI> Mr. Pope was &s;hocked for his friend; and then fir&s;t began to open his eyes to his Character.</P>
<P>Soon after this, a tran&s;lation of the fir&s;t book of the Iliad appeared under the name of Mr. Tickell; which coming out at a critical juncture, when Mr. Pope was in the mid&s;t of his engagements on the &s;ame &s;ubject, and by a creature of Mr. Addi&s;on's, made him &s;u&s;pect this to be another &s;haft from the &s;ame quiver: And after a diligent enquiry, and laying many odd circum&s;tances together, he was fully convinced that it was not only publi&s;hed with Mr. Addi&s;on's participation, but was
<PB N="27" REF="30" MS="Y">
indeed his own performance. Mr. Pope, in his fir&s;t re&s;ent|ment of this u&s;age, was re&s;olved to expo&s;e this new Ver&s;ion in a &s;evere critic upon it. I have now by me the Copy he had marked for this purpo&s;e; in which he has cla&s;&s;ed the &s;everal faults in tran&s;lation, language, and numbers, under their pro|per heads. But the growing &s;plendor of his own work &s;o eclip&s;ed the faint efforts of this oppo&s;ition, that he tru&s;ted to its own weakne&s;s and malignity for the ju&s;tice due to it. About this time, Mr. Addi&s;on's &s;on in law, the E. of Warwick, told Mr. Pope, that it was in vain to think of being well with his Father who was naturally a jealous man; that Mr. Pope's &s;u|perior talents in poetry had hurt him, and to &s;uch a degree, that he had underhand encouraged <HI>Gildon</HI> to write a thing about Wycherley, in which he had &s;currilou&s;ly abu&s;ed Mr. Pope and his family; and for this &s;ervice he had given Gildon ten gui|neas, after the pamphlet was printed. The very next day Mr. Pope, in a great heat, wrote Mr. Addi&s;on a Letter, where|in he told him, he was no &s;tranger to his behaviour; which, however, he &s;hould not imitate: But that what he thought faul|ty in him, he would tell him fairly to his face; and what de|&s;erved prai&s;e he would not deny him to the world: and, as a proof of this di&s;po&s;ition towards him, he had &s;ent him the in|clo&s;ed, which was the <HI>Character,</HI> fir&s;t publi&s;hed &s;eparately, and afterwards in&s;erted in this place of the Epi&s;t. to Dr. Arbuth|not. This plain dealing had no ill effect. Mr. Addi&s;on treat|ed Mr. Pope with civility, and, as Mr. Pope believed, with ju&s;tice, from this time to his death, which happened about three years after.</P>

<HEAD>THE Fir&s;t Satire of the Second Book OF HORACE IMITATED.</HEAD>
<P>WHOEVER expects a <HI>Paraphra&s;e</HI> of Horace, or a faithful Copy of his genius, or manner of writing, in the&s;e IMITATIONS, will be much di&s;appointed. Our Author u&s;es the Roman Poet for little more than his canvas: And if the old de&s;ign or colouring chance to &s;uit his purpo&s;e, it is well: if not, he employs his own, without &s;cruple or ceremony. Hence it is, he is &s;o frequently &s;erious where Horace is in je&s;t; and at ea&s;e where Horace is di&s;turbed. In a word, he regulates his movements no further on his Original, than was nece&s;&s;ary for his concurrence, in pro|moting their common plan of <HI>Reformation of manners.</HI></P>
<P>Had it been his purpo&s;e merely to paraphra&s;e an ancient Sati|ri&s;t he had hardly made choice of Horace; with whom, as a Poet, he held little in common, be&s;ides a comprehen&s;ive know|ledge of life and manners, and a certain <HI>curious felicity</HI> of ex|pre&s;&s;ion, which con&s;i&s;ts in u&s;ing the &s;imple&s;t language with dig|nity, and the mo&s;t ornamented, with ea&s;e. For the re&s;t, his harmony and &s;trength of numbers, his force and &s;plendor of colouring, his gravity and &s;ublime of &s;entiment, would have ra|ther led him to another model. Nor was his temper le&s;s unlike that of Horace, than his talents. What Horace would only &s;mile at, Mr. Pope would treat with the grave &s;everity of Per|&s;ius: And what Mr. Pope would &s;trike with the cau&s;tic light|ening of Juvenal, Horace would content him&s;elf in turning into ridicule.</P>
<P>If it be a&s;ked then, why he took any body at all to <HI>imitate,</HI> he has informed us in his <HI>Adverti&s;ement.</HI> To which we may add, that this &s;ort of Imitations, which are of the nature of <HI>Parodies,</HI> add reflected grace and &s;plendor on original wit. Be|&s;ides, he deem'd it more mode&s;t to give the name of Imitations to his Satires, than, like De&s;preaux, to give the name of Sa|tires to Imitations.</P>

<P>VER. 3. <HI>Scarce to wi&s;e</HI> Peter&mdash;Chartres] It has been com|monly ob&s;erved of the Engli&s;h, that a Rogue never goes to the Gallows without the pity of the Spectators, and their parting cur&s;es on the rigour of the Laws that brought him thither: and this has been as commonly a&s;cribed to the <HI>good nature</HI> of the people. But it is a mi&s;take. The true cau&s;e is their hatred and envy of power. Their compa&s;&s;ion for Dunces and Scoun|drels (when expo&s;ed by great writers to public contempt, either in ju&s;tice to the age, or in vindication of their own Characters) has the &s;ame &s;ource.

<P>VER. 7. <HI>Tim'rous by nature, of the Rich in awe,]</HI> The delicacy of this does not &s;o much lie in the ironical application of it to him&s;elf, as in its &s;eriou&s;ly characteri&s;ing the Per&s;on for who&s;e advice he applies.</P>
<P>VER. 12. <HI>Not write?</HI> &amp;c.] He has omitted the mo&s;t hu|mourous part of the an&s;wer,
<Q><L>Peream male, &s;i non</L>

For conci&s;ene&s;s, when it is clear (as in this place) gives the highe&s;t grace to elegance of expre&s;&s;ion.&mdash;But what follows is as much above the Original, as this falls &s;hort of it.</P>
<P>VER. 20. <HI>Hart&s;horn]</HI> This was intended as a plea&s;antry on the novelty of the pre&s;cription.</P>
<P>VER. 23. <HI>What? like Sir Richard,</HI> &amp;c.] Mr. Molyneux, a great Mathematician and Philo&s;opher, had a high opinion of Sir Richard Blackmore's poetic vein. <HI>All our Engli&s;h poets, ex|cept Milton</HI> (&s;ays he, in a letter to Mr. Locke) <HI>have been mere</HI>
<PB N="55" REF="56">
<HI>ballad-makers in compari&s;on of him.</HI> And Mr. Locke, in an&s;wer to this ob&s;ervation, replies, <HI>I find, with plea&s;ure, a &s;trange har|mony throughout, between your Thoughts and mine.</HI> Ju&s;t &s;o a Roman Lawyer, and a Greek Hi&s;torian, thought of the poetry of Cicero. But the&s;e being judgments made by men out of their own profe&s;&s;ion, are little regarded. And Pope and Juvenal will make Blackmore and Tully pa&s;s for Poeta&s;ters to the world's end.</P>

<P>VER. 99. <HI>In durance, exile, Bedlam, or the Mint,]</HI> The Poet, in our equal Government, might talk of the di&s;a&s;ters incident to wit, at his ea&s;e, and with all this levity of &s;tyle. But it was a &s;erious matter with Horace; and is &s;o &s;till with our witty Neigh|bours; one of whom has well expre&s;&s;ed their condition, in the following lines,</P>

Our Author's abundance of Wit has made his readers backward in acknowledging his Humour. But the veins are equally rich; and the one flows with ea&s;e, and the other is always placed with propriety.</P>

<P>Ibid. <HI>Could pen&s;ion'd Boileau&mdash;Could Laureate Dryden]</HI> It was Horace's purpo&s;e to compliment the former times, and therefore he gives the virtuous examples of Scipio and Laelius; it was Mr. Pope's, to &s;atirize the pre&s;ent, and therefore he gives the vicious examples of Louis, Charles, and James. Either way the in&s;tances are equally pertinent; but in the latter they have ra|ther greater force. Only the line,

In the begin|ning of George I. lord Hallifax, of his own motion, &s;ent for Mr. Pope, and told him, it had often given him concern that &s;o great a Poet had never been di&s;tingui&s;hed; that he was glad it was now in his power to &s;erve him; and, if he cared to accept it, he &s;hould have a pen&s;ion not clogged with any engagements. Mr. Pope thanked him, and de&s;ired time to con&s;ider of it. After three months (having heard nothing further from that Lord) he wrote him a letter to repeat his thanks; in which he took oc|ca&s;ion to mention the affair of the <HI>pen&s;ion</HI> with much indifference. So the thing dropt till Mr. Craggs came into the Mini&s;try. The affair of the <HI>pen&s;ion</HI> was then re&s;umed. And this mini&s;ter, in a very frank and friendly manner, told Mr. Pope, that three hun|dred pounds a year was then at his &s;ervice: that he had the ma|nagement
<PB N="68" REF="71">
of the &s;ecret-&s;ervice money, and could pay him &s;uch a pen&s;ion, without its being known, or ever coming to account. But now Mr. Pope declined the offer without he&s;itation: only, in return for &s;o friendly a propo&s;al, he told the Secretary, that if at any time he wanted money he would draw upon him for 100 or 200 l. which liberty, notwith&s;tanding, he never took. Mr. Craggs more than once pre&s;&s;ed him on this head; and urged the conveniency of a Chariot; which Mr. Pope was &s;en|&s;ible enough of: But the precariou&s;ne&s;s of that &s;upply made him very prudently decline the thoughts of an equipage, which it was much better never to &s;et up, than not properly to &s;up|port.</P>

VER. 80. <HI>The Soul &s;ub&s;ides, and wickedly inclines To &s;eem but mortal ev'n in &s;ound Divines.]</HI> Horace was an Epicurean, and laughed at the immortality of the &s;oul.

To <HI>this</HI> his ridicule is pointed. Our Poet, with more &s;obriety
<PB N="85" REF="87">
and judgment, has turned the ridicule, from the Doctrine, which he believed, upon tho&s;e Preachers of it, who&s;e fea&s;ts and compotations in Taverns did not edify him: and &s;o has added &s;urprizing humour and &s;pirit to the ea&s;y elegance of the Ori|ginal.</P>

<Q><L>Cur eget indignus qui&s;quam, te divite?</L></Q>
is here admirably paraphra&s;ed. And it is ob&s;ervable in the&s;e <HI>Imitations,</HI> that where our Poet keeps to the &s;entiments of Ho|race, he rather piques him&s;elf in excelling the mo&s;t fini&s;hed touches of his Original, than in correcting or improving the more inferior parts. Of this uncommon excellence all his Writ|ings bear &s;uch marks, that it gave countenance to an invidious imputation, as if his chief talent lay in copying finely. But if ever there was an inventive genius in Poetry it was Pope's. But his fancy was &s;o corrected by his judgment and his imitation &s;o

<P>VER. 128. <HI>As M**o's was, etc.]</HI> I think this light &s;troke of &s;atire ill placed; and hurts the dignity of the preceding mo|rality. Horace was very &s;erious, and properly &s;o, when he &s;aid,

<PB N="90" REF="92">
cau&s;e. He had prepared his apology for this liberty, in the pre|ceding line, where he pays a fine compliment to Augu&s;tus:
<Q><L>quare</L>

Thus in &s;erving him&s;elf of his friend to temper the rigidity of one &s;ect of philo&s;ophy, while the Apo|&s;tle is employed to rectify the loo&s;ene&s;s of the other, he brings Mr. <HI>Lyttelton</HI> and St. <HI>Paul</HI> acquainted; for tho&s;e who correct oppo&s;ite extremes mu&s;t needs meet; and &s;o we &s;ee the <HI>Patriot</HI>

<P>THE Reflections of <HI>Horace,</HI> and the Judgments pa&s;t in his Epi&s;tle to <HI>Augu&s;tus,</HI> &s;eem'd &s;o &s;ea&s;on|able to the pre&s;ent Times, that I could not help apply|ing them to the u&s;e of my own Country. The Author thought them con&s;iderable enough to addre&s;s them to his Prince; whom he paints with all the great and good qua|lities of a Monarch, upon whom the Romans depended for the Encrea&s;e of an <HI>Ab&s;clute Empire.</HI> But to make the Poem entirely Engli&s;h, I was willing to add one or two of tho&s;e which contribute to the Happine&s;s of a <HI>Free People,</HI> and are more con&s;i&s;tent with the Welfare of <HI>our Neigh|bours.</HI></P>
<P>This Epi&s;tle will &s;how the learned World to have fal|len into Two mi&s;takes: one, that <HI>Augu&s;tus was a Patro$ of Poets in general;</HI> whereas he not only prohibited all but the Be&s;t Writers to name him, but recommended that Care even to the Civil Magi&s;trate: <HI>Admonebat Pra$|tores, ne paterentur Nomen &s;uum ob&s;olefieri,</HI> etc. The other, that this Piece was only a <HI>general Di&s;cour&s;e of Poetry;</HI> whereas it was an <HI>Apology for the Poets,</HI> in order to render <HI>Augu&s;tus</HI> more their Patron. <HI>Horace</HI> here pleads the Cau&s;e of his Cotemporaries, fir&s;t again&s;t the Ta&s;te of the <HI>Town,</HI> who&s;e humour it was to magnify the Authors of the pre|ceding Age; &s;econdly again&s;t the <HI>Court</HI> and <HI>Nobility,</HI> who encouraged only the Writers for the Theatre; and la&s;tly again&s;t the <HI>Emperor</HI> him&s;elf, who had conceived them of little U&s;e to the Government. He &s;hews (by a View of the Progre&s;s of Learning, and the Change of
<PB REF="142">
Ta&s;te among the Romans) that the Introduction of the Polite Arts of <HI>Greece</HI> had given the Writers of his Time great advantages over their Predece&s;&s;ors; that their <HI>Mo|rals</HI> were much improved, and the Licence of tho&s;e an|cient Poets re&s;trained: that <HI>Satire</HI> and <HI>Comedy</HI> were be|come more ju&s;t and u&s;eful; that whatever extravagan|cies were left on the Stage, were owing to the <HI>Ill Ta&s;te</HI> of the <HI>Nobility;</HI> that Poets, under due Regulations, were in many re&s;pects u&s;eful to the <HI>State,</HI> and concludes, that it was upon them the <HI>Emperor</HI> him&s;elf mu&s;t depend, for his Fame with Po&s;terity.</P>
<P>We may farther learn from this Epi&s;tle, that <HI>Horace</HI> made his Court to this Great Prince by writing with a decent Freedom toward him, with a ju&s;t Contempt of his low Flatterers, and with a manly Regard to his own Character. <BIBL>P.</BIBL></P>

VER. 69. <HI>Shake&s;pear.]</HI> Shak &s;pear and Ben John&s;on may truly be &s;aid not much to have thought of this Immortality, the one in many pieces compo&s;ed in ha&s;te for the Stage: the other in his latter works in general, which <HI>Dryden</HI> call'd his <HI>Dotages.</HI> P. Ibid. <HI>Shake&s;pear&mdash;For gain, not glory, etc.]</HI> SHAKESPEAR knew perfectly well what belonged to a true compo&s;ition, as ap|pears from <HI>the Tempe&s;t,</HI> and <HI>the Merry Wives of Wind&s;or.</HI> But he generally complied with the ignorance, and the ill ta&s;te of his Au|dience. However, in his mo&s;t irregular plays his wit and &s;ublimity make amends for his tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion of the rules of art, and &s;up|port him in it. But, happily for the improvement of the Drama, he had a competitor in JOHNSON; who, with a greater tempta|tion to comply with the bad ta&s;te of the age, yet had not the &s;ame force of genius to &s;upport an irregular compo&s;ition. John&s;on, therefore, borrowed all he could from art; and like an expe|rienced general, when he could not depend on his natural &s;trength, never ventured from behind his lines. The con&s;equence was, that Shake&s;pear having once tried to reform the ta&s;te [See Hamlet] and, on failing, had complied with it, became the favourite Poet of the People; while John&s;on, who, for the rea&s;on given
<PB N="153" REF="152">
above, could not be &s;o complai&s;ant, was all his life long in a &s;tate of war with them. This, and not (as is commonly imagined) the ignorance of one, and the &s;uperior knowledge of the other, was the true cau&s;e of that difference which we find between the&s;e two Capital Writers, in the art and con&s;truction of their pieces. So that here, we &s;ee, a want of &s;ufficient na|tural genius accidentally contributed to the refinement of the Engli&s;h &s;tage.</P>

<P>VER. 104. <HI>Bentley]</HI> This excellent critic, who had the for|tune to be extravagantly de&s;pi&s;ed and ridiculed by two of the greate&s;t wits, and as extravagantly feared and flattered by two of the greate&s;t Scholars of his time, will de&s;erve to have that ju|&s;tice done him now, which he never met with while alive.</P>
<P><PB N="158" REF="157">
He was a great ma&s;ter both of the languages and the learn|ing of polite Antiquity; who&s;e writings he &s;tudied with no other de&s;ign than to correct the errors of the text. For this he had a &s;trong natural under&s;tanding, a great &s;hare of penetration, and a &s;agacity and acumen very uncommon. All which qualities he had greatly improved by long exerci&s;e and application. Yet, at the &s;ame time, he had &s;o little of that elegance of judgment, we call <HI>Ta&s;te,</HI> that he knew nothing of <HI>Style,</HI> as it accommo|dates it&s;elf, and is appropriated to the various kinds of compo|&s;ition. And the faculties of his Under&s;tanding being infinitely better than tho&s;e of his Imagination, the <HI>&s;tyle of poetry</HI> was what he had the lea&s;t idea of. So that, that clearne&s;s of concep|tion, which &s;o much a&s;&s;i&s;ted his critical &s;agacity, in di&s;covering and reforming errors in books of &s;cience, where a philo&s;ophical preci&s;ion, and grammatical exactne&s;s of language is employed, &s;erved but to betray him into ab&s;urd and extravagant conjec|tures when ever he attempted to reform the text of a Poet, who&s;e diction he was always for deducing to the pro&s;aic rules of logi|cal &s;everity; and whenever he found what a great ma&s;ter of &s;peech calls <HI>verbum ardens,</HI> he was &s;ure not to leave it till he had thoroughly quenched it in his critical &s;tandi&s;h. But to make philology amends, he was a perfect ma&s;ter of all the my&s;teries of the ancient <HI>Rythmus.</HI></P>
<P>The mo&s;t important of his works, as a &s;cholar, is his <HI>Critic on the Epi&s;tles of Phalaris:</HI> and the lea&s;t con&s;iderable, his <HI>Remarks on the Di&s;cour&s;e concerning Free-thinking.</HI> Yet the fir&s;t, with all its &s;uperiority of Learning, Argument, and Truth, was borne down by the vivacity and clamour of a Party, which carried the Public along with them: while the other, employed only in the ea&s;y and trifling ta&s;k of expo&s;ing a very dull and very ignorant Rhap&s;odi&s;t, was as extravagantly extolled. For it was his odd fortune (as our Poet expre&s;&s;es it) to pa&s;s for<Q><L>A Wit with Dunces, and a Dunce with Wits:</L></Q>
<PB N="159" REF="158">
whereas in truth he was neither one nor the other. The inju&s;tice that had been done him in the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> ca&s;e, made him always &s;peak, among&s;t his friends, of the blind partiality of the public in the <HI>latter,</HI> with the contempt it de&s;erved. For however he might &s;ometime mi&s;take his fort, he was never the dupe of the Pub|lic judgment. Of which a learned Prelate, now living, gave me this in&s;tance: He accidentally met Bentley in the days of Phalaris; and after having complimented him on that noble piece of Critici&s;m (the <HI>An&s;wer</HI> to the Oxford writers) he bad him not be di&s;couraged at this run upon him: for tho' they had got the laughers on their &s;ide, yet mere wit and raillery could not long hold out again&s;t a work of &s;o much merit. To which the other replied, <Q>&startq;Indeed, Dr. S. I am in no pain about the matter. For I hold it as certain, that no man was ever written out of reputation, but by him&s;elf.&endq;</Q> What pity, that he &s;hould live to verify his own maxim!</P>
<P>Ibid. <HI>his de&s;p'rate hook]</HI> Alluding to the &s;everal pa&s;&s;ages of Milton, which Bentley has reprobated, by including within hooks, &s;ome with judgment, and &s;ome without.</P>
<P>VER. 108. <HI>The Mob of Gentlemen who wrote with Ea&s;e;]</HI> The Poet has here very happily exemplified this envied quality of <HI>ea&s;y writing</HI> in the turn of the ver&s;es that expo&s;e it. The&s;e wits formed them&s;elves, for the mo&s;t part, on <HI>Suckling,</HI> a fine and original genius. But on &s;o &s;lippery a ground it was no won|der &s;uch Imitators &s;hould fall; and either &s;ink his free and ea&s;y manner into in&s;ipidity, or abu&s;e it to ribaldry and licentiou&s;ne&s;s: they did both; till ea&s;y writing came to be defined a negligence of <HI>what</HI> they &s;aid, and <HI>how</HI> they &s;aid it. This was called writ|ing like a <HI>Gentleman.</HI> But as fa&s;hions take their turn, Lord Shafte&s;bury has introduced a new &s;ort of <HI>Gentleman-like writing,</HI> which con&s;i&s;ts indeed, like the other, in a negligence of what is &s;aid, but joined to much affectation in the manner of &s;aying it.</P>

<PB N="162" REF="161">
met, to be a Cur-dog. So our re&s;pectable Laureat will needs imitate his betters, and <HI>dare to deride</HI> too with the be&s;t. <Q>&startq;In what raptures (&s;ays he) have I &s;een an audience, at the fu|rious &s;u&s;tian and turgid rants of Nat. Lee's <HI>Alexander the Great.</HI> Let me give you a &s;ample. Alexander, in a full croud of courtiers, &s;ays,
<LG>
<L>When Glory, like the dazzling <HI>Eagle,</HI> &s;tood</L>
<L>Perch'd on my Beaver in the Granic flood;</L>
<L>When <HI>Fortune's</HI> &s;elf my &s;tandard trembling bore,</L>
<L>And the pale <HI>Fates</HI> &s;tood frighted on the &s;hore;</L>
<L><HI>When the</HI> Immortals on the billows rode,</L>
<L>And I my&s;elf appear'd the leading God.</L>
</LG>
If this pa&s;&s;age has merit, let us &s;ee what figure it would make upon canvas; what &s;ort of picture would ari&s;e from it. If Le Brun had &s;een this lofty de&s;cription, what one image could he have po&s;&s;ibly taken from it? In what colours could he have &s;hewn us <HI>Glory perch'd upon a beaver?</HI> How could he have drawn Fortune trembling? Or indeed what u&s;e could he have made of <HI>pale Fates,</HI> or <HI>Immortals riding upon billows,</HI> with this blu&s;tering God of his own making at the head of them?&endq;</Q> <HI>Apol. for his life,</HI> p. 88. Ed. oct.&mdash;If the <HI>Audience were in raptures</HI> I admire their good ta&s;te: for, I think, the&s;e &s;ix lines are as truly &s;ublime as any thing we have in the Eng|li&s;h Language. But the Critic is for having the images they convey painted. And, it mu&s;t be owned, this is no ill te&s;t of di&s;tingui&s;hing <HI>&s;ound</HI> from <HI>&s;ub&s;tance.</HI> He is indeed a little mi&s;|taken in his Painter, as the Connoi&s;&s;eurs will tell him. For this &s;ubject demands the genius of Rubens rather than Le Brun. And, from &s;uch a one, he might have a very good picture for his money. He &s;eems not to have reflected that <HI>Fortune</HI> and the
<PB N="163" REF="162">
<HI>Fates</HI> tho' imaginary, are yet per&s;onified Beings. And <HI>Glory,</HI> here, is &s;omething more &s;ub&s;tantial; for by the line,
<Q><L>When Glory like the dazzling Eagle &s;tood, etc.</L></Q>
is meant that Glory appear'd in the &s;hape of an Eagle on his cre&s;t.</P>
<P>The truth is, the&s;e &s;ix lines, unluckily for the Laureate's critici&s;m, contain not only the mo&s;t <HI>&s;ublime</HI> but the mo&s;t <HI>judi|cious</HI> imagery that poetry could conceive or paint. The <HI>fir&s;t</HI> line alludes to the tradition of an Eagle's hovering over Alex|ander's head, at the battle of Arbela, as a pre&s;age of Victory; Lee, I &s;uppo&s;e, might think him&s;elf at liberty to transfer it to the pa&s;&s;age of the Granicus; and this the poet has made the ground of his fine imagination, of <HI>Glory</HI> in the &s;hape of an <HI>Eagle,</HI> in the &s;tyle of Homer, who repre&s;ents Terror, Affright, and a number of &s;uch fanta&s;tic Beings, &s;warming on the cre&s;ts of his heroes.</P>
<P>The repre&s;enting <HI>Fortune,</HI> in the <HI>third</HI> line, as his &s;tandard|bearer, is very happy. It is not only in the true &s;pirit of poetry, but it gives us a right idea of the nature of his A&s;iatic expedi|tion; and the making her <HI>tremble,</HI> as &s;he di&s;played it, in the pa&s;&s;age of the Granicus, the ju&s;te&s;t notion of the exceeding ra&s;h|ne&s;s of that adventure.</P>
<P>The <HI>fourth</HI> line greatly heightens all the&s;e images, by making the <HI>Fates</HI> them&s;elves (who had de&s;tined the Per&s;ian empire to de|&s;truction, and called Alexander out of Greece to execute their
<PB N="164" REF="163">
decrees) as half afraid that this de&s;perate Madman would fru&s;trate their purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>But the &s;ublime of the <HI>two la&s;t</HI> ver&s;es exceeds all the re&s;t. They are a beautiful allu&s;ion to the battle of Scamander in Homer, where Achilles led on the Gods them&s;elves to the de&s;truction of Troy, thro' the billows of that River, which oppo&s;ed their pa&s;&s;age. And the exqui&s;ite judgment of the Poet in this allu|&s;ion is &s;een by tho&s;e who have heard that Achilles was Alexan|der's model of Heroi&s;m, and Homer his favourite Hi&s;torian. La&s;tly, as to the propriety of Alexander's thus extolling his own actions, the Poet is ju&s;tified by Q. Curtius, from whom we learn that it was his cu&s;tom.</P>
<P>From what has been &s;aid, we may collect how dangerous it is for a writer to give his opinion out of his own Profe&s;&s;ion, how well &s;oever he may &s;ucceed within it. For this ju&s;tice is due to the Laureate, that that part of his book, where he has drawn the characters of the &s;et of Players on whom he formed him&s;elf, or whom he emulated, and that, with a performance equal to the mo&s;t perfect of theirs, is indeed (bating the &s;ingu|larity of his phra&s;e) a Ma&s;ter-piece in its kind. So nece&s;&s;ary was that ancient direction</P>

<P>When Mr. Addi&s;on, in the year 1713, had fini&s;hed his <HI>Cato,</HI> he brought it to Mr. Pope for his judgment. Our Poet, who thought the &s;entiments excellent, but the action not enough theatrical, gave him his opinion fairly, and told him that he had better not bring it upon the Stage, but print it like a cla&s;&s;ical performance, which would perfectly an&s;wer his de&s;ign. Mr. Addi&s;on approved of this advice; and &s;eemed di&s;po&s;ed to follow it. But &s;oon after he came to Mr. Pope, and told him, that &s;ome friends, whom he could not di&s;oblige, in&s;i&s;ted on his hav|ing

Our Poet exe|cuted his commi&s;&s;ion in the mo&s;t friendly manner; and the Play, and the project for bringing it upon the Stage, had their approbation and encouragement. Throughout the carriage of this whole affair, Mr. Addi&s;on was &s;o exceedingly afraid of party imputations, that when Mr. Pope, at his reque&s;t wrote the fa|mous prologue to it, and had &s;aid,
<Q><L>"Britons, ARISE, be worth like this approv'd,</L>
<L>"And &s;hew you have the virtue to be mov'd.</L></Q>

which the following in&s;tance will put out of doubt. The famous HUGO GROTIUS had, &s;ome how or other, &s;urprized the world into an early admiration of his parts and virtues. But his Grace Archbi&s;hop Abbot was not the dupe of dazzling appearances. In one of his <HI>Re&s;cripts</HI> to Sir Ralph Winwood, at the Hague, he unma&s;ks this forward Dutchman, who a little before had been &s;ent over to England by the States. <Q>&startq;You mu&s;t take heed how you tru&s;t DOCTOR GROTIUS too far, for I perceive him to be so ADDICTED TO SOME PARTIALITIES IN THOSE PARTS, THAT HE FEARETH NOT TO LASH SO IT MAY SERVE A TURN. At his fir&s;t coming to the King, by rea&s;on, of his good Latin tongue, he was &s;o tedious and full of tittle-tattle, that the KING's <HI>judgment was of him that he was &s;ome</HI> PEDANT, full of words, and of NO GREAT JUDG|MENT. And <HI>I my&s;elf di&s;covering</HI> that to be his habit, as if he did imagine that every man was bound to hear him &s;o long as he would talk, did privately give him notice thereof, that he &s;hould plainly and directly deliver his mind, or el&s;e he would make the King weary of him. This did not take place but that afterwards he fell to it again, as was e&s;pecially ob&s;erved one night at &s;upper at the Lord Bi&s;hop of Ely's, whither being brought by Mr. Ca&s;aubon (as I think) my Lord intreated him to &s;tay to &s;upper, which he did. There was pre&s;ent Dr. Steward and another Civilian, unto whom he flings out &s;ome que&s;tion of that profe&s;&s;ion, and was &s;o full of words, that Dr. Steward afterwards told my Lord, <HI>That he did perceive by him,</HI>

<HI>that, like a</HI> SMATTERER, <HI>he had &s;tudied &s;ome two or three que&s;tions, whereof when he came in company he mu&s;t be talking to vindicate his &s;kill; but, if he were put from tho&s;e, he would &s;hew him&s;elf but a</HI> SIMPLE FELLOW. There was pre&s;ent al&s;o Dr. Richard&s;on, the King's profe&s;&s;or of Divinity in Cam|bridge, and another Doctor in that Faculty, with whom he falleth in al&s;o about &s;ome of tho&s;e que&s;tions, which are now controverted among&s;t the Mini&s;ters in Holland. And be|ing matters wherein he was &s;tudied, he uttered all his &s;kill concerning them. MY LORD OF ELY SITTING STILL AT THE SUPPER ALL THE WHILE, AND WONDERING what a man he had there, who never being in the place or company before could overwhelm them &s;o with talk for &s;o long a time.

<P>VER. 52. <HI>Bred up at home, etc.]</HI> The Reader may po&s;&s;ibly have a curio&s;ity to know &s;omething more of Mr. Pope's educa|tion than what this ver&s;e tells him; and tho' much more would be too trifling to enter into a ju&s;t volume of his life, it may do no di&s;honour to one of the&s;e cur&s;ory notes. He was taught his letters very early by an Aunt; and, from thence, to his eighth year, he took great delight in reading. He learn'd to write of him&s;elf by copying after printed books, who&s;e characters he brought him&s;elf to imitate in great perfection. At eight, he was put under one <HI>Taverner,</HI> a Prie&s;t, who taught him the rudi|ments of the Latin and Greek tongues, together: From him, in a little time, he was &s;ent to a private &s;chool at Twiford near
<PB N="210" REF="208">
Winche&s;ter. Here, he continued about a year, and was then re|moved to another, near Hyde-park Corner. Under the&s;e two la&s;t Ma&s;ters he lo&s;t the little he had got under the Prie&s;t. At Twelve, he went with his Father into the Fore&s;t; where he was, for a few months, under another Prie&s;t, and with as little &s;ucce&s;s as before. For, as he u&s;ed to &s;ay, he never could learn any thing which he did not pur&s;ue with plea&s;ure. And the&s;e mi&s;erable pedants had not the art of making his &s;tudies an amu&s;ement to him. Upon the remnants, therefore, of this &s;mall &s;tock, &s;o hardly picked up, &s;o ea&s;ily lo&s;t, and recovered (as we &s;hall &s;ee) with &s;o much la|bour, he at length thought fit to become his own ma&s;ter. And now the only method of &s;tudy he pre&s;cribed to him&s;elf was read|ing tho&s;e cla&s;&s;ic writers, who afforded him mo&s;t entertainment. So that while he was intent upon the &s;ubject, with a &s;trong ap|petite for Knowledge, and an equal pa&s;&s;ion for Poetry, he in|&s;en&s;ibly got Latin and Greek. And, what was extraordinary, his impatience of re&s;traint, in the u&s;ual forms, did not hinder his &s;ubjecting him&s;elf; now he was his own ma&s;ter, to all the drudgery and fatigue of perpetually recurring to his Grammar and Lexicon. By the time he was fifteen he had acquired a very ready habit in the learned languages; when a &s;trong fancy came into his head to remove to London, to learn French and Italian. His Family (who&s;e only object was the pre&s;ervation of his mi&s;erably infirm body) regarded it as a very wild project. But he per&s;i&s;ted in it, and they gave way: to town he went; and ma&s;tered tho&s;e two languages with &s;urprizing di&s;patch. The whole trea&s;ure of Parna&s;&s;us now lay open to him; and, between this and his twentieth year, his con&s;tant employment was read|ing
<PB N="211" REF="209">
the mo&s;t con&s;iderable poets and critics in the Greek, La|tin, French, Italian, and Engli&s;h languages. But, all this, with|out much order, as chance threw them in his way, or the ca|price of de&s;ultory reading directed his choice. This being one continued indulgence of his curio&s;ity or amu&s;ement, made him always &s;peak of the&s;e four or five years as the mo&s;t plea&s;urable part of his life.</P>
<P>Yet his true under&s;tanding would not &s;uffer him to continue long the dupe of &s;o defective an education. For a va&s;t memory, and an accurate judgment, which remedied many of its incon|veniences, made him but the more &s;en&s;ible of them all. So that, at twenty, when the impetuo&s;ity of his &s;pirits began to &s;uf|fer his genius to be put under re&s;traint, he went over all the parts of his education a-new, from the very beginning, and in a regu|lar, and more artful manner. He penetrated into the general grounds and rea&s;ons of &s;peech; he learnt to di&s;tingui&s;h the &s;e|veral &s;pecies of &s;tyle; he &s;tudied the peculiar genius and charac|ter of each language; he reduced his natural talent for poetry to a &s;cience, and ma&s;tered tho&s;e parts of philo&s;ophy that would mo&s;t contribute to enrich his vein. And all this, with &s;uch continued attention, labour, and &s;everity, that he u&s;ed to &s;ay, he had been &s;even years (that is, from twenty to twenty-&s;even) in unlearning all he had been acquiring for twice &s;even.</P>

At the Revolution he left off trade, and converted his effects into money, amount|ing to between fifteen and twenty thou&s;and pounds, with which he retired into the country. As he was a Papi&s;t he could not purcha&s;e, nor put his money to intere&s;t on real &s;ecurity; and as he adhered to the intere&s;ts of King James, he made a point of con&s;cience not to lend it to the new Government: &s;o he kept it in his che&s;t, and lived upon the Principal; till, by that time his &s;on came to the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, it was almo&s;t all fairly &s;pent.</P>

<HEAD>THE SATIRES of Dr. DONNE.</HEAD>
<P>THE <HI>manly Wit</HI> of Donne, which was the Character of his genius, &s;uited be&s;t with <HI>Satire;</HI> and in this he excell|ed, tho' he wrote but little; &s;ix &s;hort poems being all we find among&s;t his writings of this &s;ort. Mr. Pope has em|belli&s;hed two of them with his wit and harmony. He called it <HI>ver&s;ifying</HI> them, becau&s;e indeed the lines have nothing more of numbers than their being compo&s;ed of a certain quan|tity of &s;yllables. This is the more to be admired, becau&s;e, as appears by his other poems, and e&s;pecially from that fine one called the <HI>Progre&s;s of the Soul,</HI> his Ver&s;e did not want harmony. But, I &s;uppo&s;e, he took the <HI>&s;ermoni propiora</HI> of Horace too &s;eriou&s;ly, and &s;o would imitate it literally, or rather was con|tent with the character his ma&s;ter give of Lucilius,
<Q><L>Emunctae naris durus componere ver&s;us.</L></Q>
Having &s;poken of his <HI>Progre&s;s of the Soul,</HI> let me add, that Po|etry never lo&s;t more than by his not pur&s;uing and fini&s;hing that noble De&s;ign; of which he has only given us the Introduction. With regard to his Satires, it is almo&s;t as much to be lament|ed that Mr. Pope did not give us a Paraphra&s;e, in his manner, of the <HI>Third,</HI> the noble&s;t Work not only of This, but perhaps of any &s;atiric Poet. To &s;upply this lo&s;s in &s;ome &s;mall degree, I have here in&s;erted it, in the ver&s;ification of Dr. Parnell. It will at lea&s;t &s;erve to &s;hew the force of Dr. Donne's genius, and of Mr. Pope's; by removing all that was ru&s;tic and &s;hocking in the former, and not being able to reach one &s;ingle grace of the other.</P>

VER. 104. <HI>So Luther etc.]</HI> Our Poet, by judiciou&s;ly tran&s;|po&s;ing this fine &s;imilitude, has given new lu&s;tre to his Author's thought. The Lawyer (&s;ays Dr. Donne) enlarges the legal in&s;truments for conveying property to the bigne&s;s of <HI>glo&s;s'd civil Laws,</HI> when it is to &s;ecure his own ill-got wealth. But let the &s;ame Lawyer convey property for you, and he then omits even the nece&s;&s;ary words; and becomes as conci&s;e and ha&s;ty as the loo&s;e po&s;tils of a modern Divine. So <HI>Luther</HI> while a Monk, and, by his In&s;titution, obliged to &s;ay Ma&s;s, and pray in per&s;on for others, thought even his <HI>Pater-no&s;ter</HI> too long. But when he &s;et up for a Governor in the Church, and his bu&s;ine&s;s was to direct others how to pray for the &s;ucce&s;s of his new Model; he then lengthened the Pater-no&s;ter by a new clau&s;e. This
<PB N="265" REF="261">
repre&s;entation of the fir&s;t part of his conduct was to ridicule his want of devotion; as the other, where he tells us, that the <HI>ad|dition</HI> was the <HI>power and glory clau&s;e,</HI> was to &s;atirize his ambi|tion; and both together to in&s;inuate that, from a Monk, he was become totally <HI>&s;ecularized.</HI>&mdash;About this time of his life Dr. Donne had a &s;trong propen&s;ity to Popery, which appears from &s;everal &s;trokes in the&s;e &s;atires. We find among&s;t his works, a &s;hort &s;atirical thing called a <HI>Catalogue of rare books,</HI> one article of which is intitled, <HI>M. Lutherus de abbreviatione Orationis Do|minicae,</HI> which &s;hews he was fond of the joke. As his putting Era&s;mus and Reuchlin in the rank of Lully and Agrippa &s;hews what were then his &s;entiments of Reformation. I will only ob&s;erve, that this Catalogue was written in imitation of Rabelais's
<PB N="266" REF="262">
famous <HI>Catalogue of the Library of St. Victor.</HI> It is one of the fine&s;t &s;trokes in that extravagant &s;atire (which was then the Manual of the Wits) and &s;o became the &s;ubject of much imita|tion; the be&s;t of which are this of Dr. Donne's and one of Sir Thomas Brown's.</P>

VER. 29. <HI>Seen him I have,</HI> &amp;c.] This and other &s;trokes of commendation in the following poem, as well as his forbearing him on all occa&s;ions, were in acknowledgement of a certain &s;er|vice the Mini&s;ter had done a Prie&s;t at Mr. Pope's &s;olicitation. Our Poet, when he was about &s;eventeen, had a very ill fever in the country, which, it was feared, would end fatally. In this condition, he wrote to Southcot, a Prie&s;t of his acquaintance, then in town, to take his la&s;t leave of him. Southcot with great affection and &s;olicitude applied to Dr. Radcliffe for his advice. And not content with that, he rode down po&s;t, to Mr. Pope, who was then an hundred miles from London, with the Doctor's directions; which had the de&s;ired effect. A long time after this, Southcot, who had an intere&s;t in the Court of France, writing to a common acquaintance in England, informed him that there was a good abbey near Avignon, which he had credit enough to get, were it not from an apprehen&s;ion that his promotion would give umbrage to the Engli&s;h Court, to which he (Southcot) by his intrigues in the Pretender's &s;ervice, was become very obnoxious. The per&s;on to whom this was written happening to acquaint Mr. Pope with the ca&s;e, he immediately wrote to Sir Robert Wal|pole about it; begged that this embargo might be taken off; and acquainted him with the grounds of his &s;olicitation: He told him he was indebted to Southcot for his life, and that more than his life was engaged for the di&s;charge of his obligation, for he was certainly to &s;atisfy it in purgatory, if he could not do it here. The Mini&s;ter received it favourably, and with much good-nature wrote to his brother, then in France, to remove this ob&s;truction. In con&s;equence of which Southcot got the abbey.

It was of little im|portance to enquire into the truth or fal&s;hood of the report, &s;ince what the Poet intended to &s;ay, on this occa&s;ion, was not to re|flect on Dr. Middleton, whom he e&s;teemed and had a per&s;onal regard for; but, on the contrary, to own the excellence of his judgment, in general, in words that only amount to this, <HI>though &s;o able a judge as Dr. Middleton him&s;elf &s;hould approve the Latinity, I &s;ay it is bad and barbarous.</HI> In which he u&s;es no greater freedom with this learned Man than he &s;ometimes did with tho&s;e he mo&s;t valued, as Dr. Swift and others.</P>

<P>The lines above have been commonly given as an in&s;tance of this ungenerous backwardne&s;s in doing ju&s;tice to merit. And,

indeed, if fairly given, would bear hard upon the Author, who believed the per&s;on here celebrated to be one of the greate&s;t cha|racters in private life that ever was; and known by him to be, <HI>in fact,</HI> all, and much more than he had feigned in the imaginary virtues of <HI>the man of Ro&s;s.</HI> One, who, whether he be con&s;idered in his civil, &s;ocial, dome&s;tic, or religious character, is, in all the&s;e views, an ornament to human nature.</P>
<P>And, indeed, we &s;hall &s;ee, that what is here &s;aid of him agrees only with &s;uch a Character. But as both the thought and the expre&s;&s;ion have been cen&s;ured, we &s;hall con&s;ider them in their order.</P>

We are &s;o ab&s;olutely governed by cu&s;|tom, that to act contrary to it, creates even in virtuous men, who are ever mode&s;t, a kind of diffidence, which is the parent of <HI>Shame.</HI> But when, to this, there is joined a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s that, in for&s;aking cu&s;tom, you follow truth and rea&s;on, the in|dignation ari&s;ing from &s;uch a con&s;cious virtue, mixing with <HI>&s;hame,</HI> produces that amiable <HI>aukwardne&s;s,</HI> in going out of the fa&s;hion, which the Poet, here, celebrates.</P>

<P>The Empre&s;s THEODORA was the daughter of one Acaces, who had the care of the wild bea&s;ts, which the <HI>Green faction</HI> kept for the entertainment of the people. For the Empire was, at that time, divided between the two Factions of the <HI>Green</HI> and <HI>Blue.</HI> But Acaces dying in the infancy of Theodora, and her two Si&s;ters, his place of <HI>Ma&s;ter of the Bears</HI> was di&s;po&s;ed of to a &s;tranger; and his widow had no other way of &s;upport|ing her&s;elf than by pro&s;tituting her three Daughters, who were all very pretty, on the public Theatre. Thither &s;he brought them in their turns as they came to years of puberty. Theo|dora fir&s;t attended her Si&s;ters in the habit and quality of a
<PB N="315" REF="310">
&s;lave. And when it came to her turn to mount the &s;tage, as &s;he could neither dance, nor play on the flute, &s;he was put into the lowe&s;t cla&s;s of Buffoons to make diver&s;ion for the Rabble; which &s;he did in &s;o arch a manner, and complained of the in|dignities &s;he &s;uffered in &s;o ridiculous a tone, that &s;he became the ab&s;olute favourite of the people. After a complete cour&s;e of infamy and pro&s;titution, the next place we hear of her is at Alexandria, in great poverty and di&s;tre&s;s: from whence (as it was no wonder) &s;he was willing to remove. And to Con&s;tan|tinople &s;he came, but after a large circuit thro' the Ea&s;t, where &s;he worked her way, by a free cour&s;e of pro&s;titution. JUSTI|NIAN was at this time con&s;ort in the Empire with his Uncle <HI>Ju&s;tin,</HI> and the management of affairs entirely in his hands. He no &s;ooner &s;aw Theodora than he fell de&s;perately in love with her, and would have married her immediately, but that the Empre&s;s <HI>Euphemia,</HI> a barbarian, and unpolite, but not illiberal in her nature, was then alive. And &s;he, altho' &s;he refu&s;ed him nothing el&s;e, yet ob&s;tinately refu&s;ed giving him this in&s;tance of her complai&s;ance. But &s;he did not live long: and then, nothing but the ancient Laws, which forbad a &s;enator to marry with a common pro&s;titute, hindered Ju&s;tinian from executing this ex|traordinary project. The&s;e, he obliged Ju&s;tin to revoke; and then, in the face of the &s;un, married his dear Theodora. A ter|rible example (&s;ays the Hi&s;torian) and an encouragement to the mo&s;t &s;hamele&s;s licence. And now no &s;ooner was THEODORA (in the Poet's phra&s;e) <HI>owned by Greatne&s;s,</HI> than &s;he, whom not long before it was thought <HI>unlucky</HI> to meet, and a <HI>pollution</HI> to touch, became the idol of the Court. There was not a &s;ingle Magi&s;trate (&s;ays Procopius) that expre&s;&s;ed the lea&s;t indig|nation at the &s;hame and di&s;honour brought upon the &s;tate; not a &s;ingle Prelate that &s;hewed the lea&s;t de&s;olation for the public &s;candal. They all drove to court &s;o precipitately, as if they were &s;triving to prevent one another in her good graces. Nay, the <HI>very &s;oldiers</HI> were emulous of the honour of becoming the Champions of her Virtue. As for the common people, who had &s;o long been the &s;pectators of her &s;ervility, her Buffoonry,
<PB N="316" REF="311">
and her Pro&s;titution, they all in a body threw them&s;elves at her feet, as &s;laves at the foot&s;tool of their Mi&s;tre&s;s. In a word, there was no man, of what condition &s;oever, that &s;hewed the lea&s;t di&s;like of &s;o mon&s;trous an elevation. In the mean time, Theodora's fir&s;t care was to fill her Coffers, which &s;he &s;oon did, with immen&s;e wealth. To this end, Ju&s;tinian and &s;he pretend|ed to differ in their principles.

<P>I have so great a Trust in your In|dulgence towards me, as to believe you cannot but Patronize this Imitation, so much in your own manner, and whose Birth I may truly say is o$ing to you. In that Confidence, I would not suppre&s;s the Criticisms made upon it by the Reverend Doc|tor, the rather, since he has promised to mend the faults in the next Edition, with the same Goodne&s;s he has practised to Milton. I hope you will believe that while I$pre&s;s my Regard for you, it is only out of Modesty I conceal my Name; since, tho perhaps, I may not profe&s;s myself your admirer so much as some others, I cannot but be, with as much inward Respect, Goodwill, and Zeal as any Man,</P>

<P>One RICHARD SMITH, a Book-binder and Pri&s;oner for Debt within the Liberties of the King's Bench, and Bridget Smith, his Wife, were found, about 8 a Clock in the Morning, hanging in their Chamber, about 2 Yards di&s;tant from each other; and below in the Kitchen their little Child, about Two Years old, was found in a Cradle &s;hot thro' the head. They were all neatly dre&s;s'd, in clean lin|nen, a Curtain was drawn between the Man and Woman, a Pi$tol loaded lying near him, and a Knife by her. He was hang'd with a new Cord, which She was &s;een to twi&s;t a|bout her hand the Day before. Upon the Nail which She hang'd on was a broken piece of Tape, be&s;ides the Cord, She was in, which was taken from the bed. She was 7 Months gone with Child, and when found, w$rm, but the Man quite cold. She was known to be a Papi&s;t, but the Chri&s;tian Religion mu&s;t have been quite defaced in both, by the wild notions in the following Letters which were left in the Room. One of which directed to their Landlord and two others inclo&s;ed to Mr Brindley, a Book-binder in New Bond &s;treet</P>

<P>IT is now about the Time I promis'd Pay|ment to Mr. Brooks, which I have per|formed in the be&s;t Manner I was able. I wi&s;h it had been done more to your Satisfaction; but the Thing was impo&s;&s;ible. I here return you my hearty Thanks for the Favours, which I have received; it being all the Tribute I am able to pay. There is a certain anonymous Per&s;on, whom you have &s;ome Knowledge of, who, I am inform'd, has taken &s;ome Pains to make the World believe he has done me Services&punc; I wi&s;h that &s;aid Per&s;on had never troubled his Head about my Affairs; I am &s;ure he had no Bu&s;ine&s;s with them; for it is intire|ly owing to his meddling that I came Penny|le&s;s into this Place; whereas had I brought Twenty Pounds in with me, which I could ea&s;ily have done, I could not then have mi&s;s'd getting my bread here, and in time have been able to come to Terms with my Plaintiff, who&s;e menaces I believe could not have la&s;ted always. I mu&s;t not here conclude, for my meddling Friend's Man Sancho Pancho would perhaps take it ill, did I nor make mention of him; therefore if it lies in your Way, let Sancho know that his Impudence and In&s;olence was not &s;o much forgotten as de&s;pis'd. I &s;hall now make an End of this Epi&s;tle, de&s;iring you to publi&s;h the inclos'd; as to the Manner how, I leave it intirely to your Judgment.

<P>THESE Actions, con&s;ider'd in all their Circum&s;tances, being &s;omewhat uncome|mon, it may not be improper to give $ome-Account of the Can&s;e, and that it was an in|ve$erate Hatred we conceiv'd again&s;t Poverty and Rags; Evils that through a Train of un|lucky Accidents were become inevitable; for we appeal to all that ever knew us, whether we were either idle or extravagant&punc; whether $$$o we have not taken as much Pains to get o$$ Living as our Neighbours, altho' not at|tended with the &s;ame Succe&s;s. We apprehend the $$king our Child's Life away to be a Circum&s;tance for which we &s;hall be general|$ $ondemn'd; but for our own Parts, we are perfectly ea&s;y upon that Head. We are &s;atisfied it is le&s;s Cruelty to take the Child with us, even &s;uppo&s;ing a State of Anni|hilation&punc; as &s;ome dream of, than to leave her friendle&s;s in the World, expos'd to Ignorance and Mi&s;ery; now, in order to obviate &s;ome Cen&s;ures, which may proceed either from Ignorance or Malice, we think it proper to inform the World that we firmly believe the Exi&s;tence of Almighty God; that this Belief of ours is not an implicit Faith, but deduced from the Nature and Rea&s;on of Things; we believe the Exi&s;tence of an Almighty Being, from the Con&s;ideration of his wonderful Works; from a Con&s;ideration of his wonderful Works; from a Con&s;ideration of tho&s;e in|numerable, cele&s;tial and glorious Bodies, and from their wonderful Order and Harmony. We have al&s;o &s;pent &s;ome Time in viewing tho&s;e Wonders, which are to be &s;een in the minute Part of the World, and That with great Plea&s;ure and Satisfaction; from all which Particulars we are &s;atisfied that &s;uch amazing Things could not po&s;&s;ibly be with|out a fir&s;t Mover, without the Exi&s;tence of an Almighty Being; and as we know the wonderful God to be Almighty, &s;o we cannot help believing but that he is al&s;o good, not implacable; not like &s;uch Wretches as Men are, not taking Delight in the Mi&s;eries of his Creature; for which Rea&s;on we re&s;ign up our Breaths unto him without any terrible Ap|prehen&s;ions, &s;ubmitting our &s;elves to tho&s;e Ways, which in his Goodne&s;s he &s;hall plea&s;e to appoint after Death. We al&s;o believe the Exi&s;tence of unbodied Creatures, and think We have Rea&s;on for that Belief; although We don't pretend to know their Way of &s;ub&s;i&s;ting. We are not ignorant of tho&s;e Laws made $word$ TERROREM, but leave the Di&s;po&s;al of our Bodies to the Wi&s;dom of the Coroner and his Jury; the Thing being indifferent to us where our Bodies are laid; from whence it will ap|pear how little anxious we are about a HIC JACET; we for our Parts neither expect nor de&s;ire &s;uch Honours, but &s;hall content our &s;elves with a borrowed Epitaph, which we &s;hall incert in this Paper.</P>
<LG>
<L>Without a Name, for ever &s;ilent, dumb;</L>
<L>Du&s;t, A&s;hes, nought el&s;e is within this Tomb;</L>
<L>Where We were born or bred it matters not,</L>
<L>Who were our Parents, or hath us begot,</L>
<L>We were, but now are not; think no more of us</L>
<L>For as We are, &s;o you'll be t$rn'd to D$&s;t.</L>
</LG>
<P>It is the Opinion of Naturali&s;ts, that our Bodies are at certain Stages of Life compo&s;ed of new Matter; &s;o that a great many poor Men have new Bodies oftner than new Clothes; now as Divines are not able to in|form us which of tho&s;e &s;everal Bodies &s;hall ri&s;e at the Re&s;urrection&punc; it is very probable that the decea&s;ed Body may be for ever &s;ilent as well as any other.</P>
<P>The Coroner's Inque&s;t found them both guilty of Self Murder, and of Wilful Murder, as to the Child. They were both buried in the Cro&s;s-Way near the Turnpike at <HI>New|in$t$n.</HI></P>
