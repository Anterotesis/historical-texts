<LG>
<L>IN every rank of life the friends of love,</L>
<L>(From Godde&s;&s;es below to Gods above)</L>
<L>We claim you for our patrons, and prefer</L>
<L>Our &s;uit to tho&s;e, who&s;e judgment cannot err;</L>
<L>For you have hearts, and we make no appeal</L>
<L>But to the te&s;t of what tho&s;e hearts &s;hall feel.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>If Nature quits us, every hope is fled,</L>
<L>For we have nought to tender in her &s;tead,</L>
<L>No pageant to exhau&s;t the Trea&s;urer's che&s;t,</L>
<L>Or rob the Painter of his natural re&s;t:</L>
<L>Failing to plea&s;e, we aim not to &s;urpri&s;e;</L>
<L>Palling your ears, we cannot fea&s;t your eyes.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But we believe you never will &s;ubmit</L>
<L>To naturalize the&s;e &s;ub&s;titutes for wit,</L>
<L>Therefore it is, our author keeps the &s;tage</L>
<L>With all the pertinacity of age;</L>
<L>Not in defiance of the Public will,</L>
<L>But in the hope that you'll &s;upport him &s;till;</L>
<L>Not in exclu&s;ion of another's name,</L>
<L>For dear to him is every brother's fame,</L>
<L>But to &s;hew genius of a &s;tronger growth,</L>
<L>Which el&s;e might &s;ink to indolence and &s;loth,</L>
<L>That feeble plants, when nouri&s;h'd by your care,</L>
<L>Ev'n in the winter of their age will bear.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>If, ere the hour &s;hall come that lay$ to re&s;t</L>
<L>All hopes and fears within the human brea&s;t,</L>
<L>Once more your Poet ventures to convene</L>
<L>His Mu&s;e's Patrons to the moral &s;cene,</L>
<L>'Tis in the hope that for your favors pa&s;t</L>
<L>He may yet make &s;ome &s;mall return at la&s;t.</L>
<L>Here, if he fails, and &s;hou'd this night's event</L>
<L>Prove that your favors and his fires are &s;pent,</L>
<L>What on the part of candor &s;hall be &s;aid,</L>
<L>But that his heart was &s;touter than his head?</L>
<L>But that, advancing to a fre&s;h attack,</L>
<L>He dropt, and <HI>"died with harne&s;s on his back!"</HI></L>

<SPEAKER>David.</SPEAKER>
<P>WELL! I could almo&s;t &s;wear&mdash;yet I won't be &s;ure. I wi&s;h he would look back once again.&mdash;Yes it is, by St. George, it is my dear brother Frederick.&mdash;Ah! my &s;weet fellow, wel|come to England! Don't you remember little David?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fred.</SPEAKER>
<P>David! may I believe my eyes? 'Tis he, &s;ure enough. Come to my arms my brave lad! Why you are alter'd out of knowledge, and in the navy uniform&mdash;That's right, my boy, there you're in your proper line.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>David.</SPEAKER>
<P>Aye, aye, Sir!&mdash;But we'll talk of that by-and-by. How are you in the fir&s;t place? How fares it with you, my hearty? where are you come from? what &s;ort of a cruize have you had in t'other country? Have you fallen in with father?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fred.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, nor do I wi&s;h him to know of my arrival as yet.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="6" REF="5">
<SPEAKER>David.</SPEAKER>
<P>Be it &s;o, be it &s;o! Mum's the word for that.&mdash;Are you come home full or empty? Egad, you'll find father cling plaguily by the claws, damn'd clo&s;e in the lockers.&mdash;If you are bare of the ready, I've plenty.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fred.</SPEAKER>
<P>Thank you, David, thank you heartily; but I can &s;hift. Keep your money my good lad.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>David.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not that, with your leave; I know a little better than &s;o, we may hope.&mdash;But what brings you home o'the &s;udden?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fred.</SPEAKER>
<P>My father's peremptory commands.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>David.</SPEAKER>
<P>Enough &s;aid: then 'tis on account of &s;i&s;ter's wedding.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fred.</SPEAKER>
<P>I believe not&mdash;but I did not know till this moment &s;he was married. Tell me the particu|lars, for 'tis intere&s;ting intelligence.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>David.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why &s;he's married, that's all I can tell you; &s;he has got a mate of father's own chu&s;ing; &s;o he thinks he has done a mighty feat, and rigg'd her out for a fair weather voyage; but between you and me, I &s;u&s;pect there's foul wind in feather|bed bay, and a kind of cat-and-dog harmony on board between 'em; that's my notion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fred.</SPEAKER>
<P>I can well believe it: She has not the be&s;t temper in the world. What is the gentle|man's name and condition?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>David.</SPEAKER>
<P>Wrangle is his name, and wrangling I &s;u&s;pect to be his condition; but I heartily di&s;like the man, and therefore I wou'd not have you take his character from me: &s;ee him, and judge for your&s;elf.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fred.</SPEAKER>
<P>There is one marriage in our family then to begin with; and now I mu&s;t tell you, David, in confidence, that I do not believe it was on account of this wedding my father call'd me home in &s;uch ha&s;te, but with a view to another.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>David.</SPEAKER>
<P>Like enough, like enough; that's your look-out, thank Heaven, and not mine.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fred.</SPEAKER>
<P>Bad luck for me, David, if it is as I fear; but you know Sir Paul Ruby is now dead, and my fir&s;t love is a widow, young, blooming, and
<PB N="7" REF="6">
mi&s;tre&s;s of a mine of wealth: You can remember Clara Middleton, how devotedly I was attach'd to her, and how cruelly my father tore me from her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>David.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do I remember it? Yes, to be &s;ure, and in my mind never forgave old cru&s;ty for his hard|heartedne&s;s to this hour; but if that be his &s;port, let him come on: By the Lord Harry, Fred. you'll be a gay fellow if you can bring that prize into harbour.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fred.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hu&s;h! hu&s;h! that can never be.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>David.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why you are in the right not to be too &s;ure, for all the world is after her; but if &s;he has a hankering for you &s;till, you know&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fred.</SPEAKER>
<P>Heaven forbid!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>David.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, well, I won't flatter you, brother, you are a little gone off to be &s;ure, rather the wor&s;e for wear, a &s;mall matter out of trim, but we can &s;oon put that to rights, if your timbers are but &s;taunch.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fred.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is not there I &s;hou'd fail, let us hope; but if death was the alternative, I cou'd not give my hand to Lady Ruby.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>David.</SPEAKER>
<P>I take you now; you'll be no man's &s;e|cond; I &s;ee how it is with you, fir&s;t oar or none at all.&mdash;Lord love you, what a whim is that! 'Tis no denial to a good &s;hip becau&s;e another man has commanded her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fred.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are wide of the mark, friend David; it is not that I object to Lady Ruby as a widow, for I dare &s;ay &s;he is &s;till beautiful as an angel.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>David.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's more than I know, for I never &s;aw one; but I'm &s;ure &s;he's as fre&s;h and as fine as a dai&s;ey.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fred.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why that is as lowly a &s;imilitude as you can well find for her; but with all her charms, and all her riches, and all the love &s;he cou'd be&s;tow upon me, were it warm and flattering as in our fonde&s;t moments, the barrier between us would be in&s;uperable: fate has di&s;united us for ever.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>David.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then fate has play'd you a very foul trick, let me tell you; for, &s;earch the world through, you will no where find her fellow.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="8" REF="7">
<SPEAKER>Fred.</SPEAKER>
<P>If I dare tru&s;t you with a &s;ecret, I wou'd put that to the trial; and yet I think you are too good a fellow to tell tales.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>David.</SPEAKER>
<P>Give me none to tell, and that's a &s;ure way to prevent it; but I think you might venture to tru&s;t me too.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fred.</SPEAKER>
<P>This it is, and I'll make a &s;hort &s;tory of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>David.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do &s;o!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fred.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have brought a virtuous and lovely girl with me into England&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>David.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fred.</SPEAKER>
<P>Who has been the pre&s;erver of my life, the companion of my journey from Padua to this place, and whom I have pledg'd my&s;elf to make the partner of my fortune.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>David.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your wife?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fred.</SPEAKER>
<P>My wife: the word is pa&s;&s;ed, and I mu&s;t keep it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>David.</SPEAKER>
<P>To be &s;ure you mu&s;t; but I'm &s;orry for it; there's no more to be &s;aid.&mdash;Death and fury! What a torrent will you have about your ears! Why, father will come down on you like a water|&s;pout.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fred.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am now &s;eeking out &s;ome place where &s;he can be lodg'd and boarded with people of re|putation, till I can arrange my affairs; but I have been &s;o long out of England, that I am almo&s;t as much a &s;tranger in London as her&s;elf. Perhaps, David, you can help me out.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>David.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why that's what I'm thinking of: I have a friend, a right one, as &s;taunch an old cock as ever crow'd, my navy agent, Billy Bu&s;tler by name. I'm to dine with him to-day&mdash;and he has a &s;i&s;ter Kate by the &s;ame token; a good &s;oul! but if your Mi&s;s is'nt of the right &s;ort, look you&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fred.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh fie, fie,! Can you &s;uppo&s;e any other|wi&s;e?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>David.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, well! but a word in time, you know&mdash;for Kate's a pure maiden, you mu&s;t think, with a good deal of the buckram about her. Lord!
<PB N="9" REF="8">
how I do &s;et her up &s;ometimes. So, if you've &s;towed away all your court&s;hip, d'ye &s;ee, and got your marriage tack fairly a-board, why upon the&s;e terms I think I have intere&s;t enough with Kate to coax her into compliance.&mdash;Now, what &s;ay you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fred.</SPEAKER>
<P>Let us about it directly; for my lovely charge is expecting me, and time is precious.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>David.</SPEAKER>
<P>Say no more, my bright fellow! As for Billy, he's a &s;ure card. Give me your arm, and we'll be down upon him in a whiff.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. W.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah, my dear, dear Mr. Wrangle, I have been &s;ighing for a &s;ight of you this many a long hour: Where in the world have you hidden your|&s;elf from the eyes of your fond doating wife?&mdash;Come, come, my love, look kindly upon me: We that are &s;o happy in each other, &s;hould always meet with rapture.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. W.</SPEAKER>
<P>Don't &s;ay &s;o, don't &s;ay &s;o. Can you lay your hand upon your heart, and &s;ay you love me to the full as well as ever you did?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. W.</SPEAKER>
<P>Better, better.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. W.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, you don't.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. W.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, I do.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. W.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'll &s;wear you don't; I know to a certainty your affection abates, whereas mine in|crea&s;es every hour: nay, it is &s;o exce&s;&s;ive, that I am almo&s;t afraid it grows trouble&s;ome to you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. W.</SPEAKER>
<P>Don't fear it; from my &s;oul I believe our fondne&s;s for each other is equal and alike: The uninterrupted harmony of our nuptial &s;tate, and the fidelity I have ever manife&s;ted&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. W.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, and what has my fidelity been, I would a&s;k? Notorious, unique, the talk of all

the town. I am really &s;o pointed at in all compa|nies as a mere dome&s;tic creature, that I am almo&s;t a&s;ham'd to &s;hew my face in any fa&s;hionable circle.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. W.</SPEAKER>
<P>Never mind their &s;neering; your own con&s;cience can acquit you of de&s;erving it.&mdash;If I were you, Mrs. Wrangle, I wou'd &s;ometimes pa&s;s an evening at home, if it were only to &s;hew them you de&s;pi&s;e their &s;pleen.</P>
</SP>

<P>The pre&s;ent indeed! How can you ex|pect it? Is'nt it opera night? Wou'd you wi&s;h to deprive me of my only plea&s;ure? Is there any thing in life I love &s;o well as an opera?</P>

<P>With the opera to help it out.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. W.</SPEAKER>
<P>The opera indeed!

<SPEAKER>Frederick.</SPEAKER>
<P>FRIEND of my life! my benevolent pre&s;erver! I have now happily accompli&s;h'd one effort of my gratitude, by e&s;corting you to an a&s;ylum, where per&s;ecution cannot reach you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sabina.</SPEAKER>
<P>Generous Mowbray! I do wi&s;h to tell you, in the language you have taught me, how my poor heart is penetrated with your goodne&s;s to me, but I am not eloquent; I can only &s;ay I do thank you for your care of me, and for bringing me to your charitable country, which I do honor from my &s;oul; indeed I do honor it; but, alas! it is not for me ever to be happy in it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fred.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why do you &s;ay that? I am incapable of deceiving you: this in&s;tant I am going to my fa|ther, and be a&s;&s;ur'd it &s;hall not be many days before the dubious &s;ituation you are in &s;hall be honorably done away, and all my promi&s;es fulfill'd</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sabina.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no, no, my good friend, I &s;hall not call upon you for tho&s;e promi&s;es; we are now in England, and tho&s;e promi&s;es are nothing, they are void.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fred.</SPEAKER>
<P>What can you mean, Sabina? Do you &s;u&s;pect my integrity?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sabina.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do not &s;u&s;pect you at all&mdash;but you was &s;ick, take notice, very &s;ick, and derang'd in your &s;en&s;es, when, becau&s;e I did do my po&s;&s;ible in pity and compa&s;&s;ion, to a&s;&s;i&s;t you in your malady, you was pleas'd to make tho&s;e promi&s;es you &s;peak, and I did let them pa&s;s for the time, &s;aying nothing to the contrary of them, becau&s;e they were very good and commodious for me, as a &s;ingle woman, travelling alone with you, under pro|tection of your honor; but now that you are at home&punc; again, and, thanks to Heaven! in good
<PB N="32" REF="31">
health, I &s;hall not be &s;o ba&s;e to let you ruin your|&s;elf by marrying poor me, only becau&s;e you pledg'd your word when you did hardly know what that word meant.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fred.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nobly conceiv'd! but I am not that wretch, to &s;acrifice my honor to a mean and mer|cenary eva&s;ion: Tho' my heart has been wounded, as you know, it has not been debas'd; and I am determin'd to go this in&s;tant to my father, and an|nounce the re&s;olution I have taken.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sabina.</SPEAKER>
<P>Stop, I conjure you, &s;top! I have &s;ome|thing on my mind to tell you.&mdash;Ah, mi&s;ericorde! What is a-coming now?</P>

<SPEAKER>Fred.</SPEAKER>
<P>Our conference, Madam, is at an end. I was on the point of my departure.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady R.</SPEAKER>
<P>By no means let me ha&s;ten it: I &s;hou'd be &s;orry to deprive the lady of one moment of your company.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fred.</SPEAKER>
<P>It has been my good fortune to be the lady's companion for &s;ome time, and we are ju&s;t arriv'd in England. Mademoi&s;elle Ro&s;ny is an emigrant of noble birth, as much to be admir'd for her virtues, as &s;he is to be pitied for her mis|fortunes.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady R.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ro&s;ny! is that the lady's name?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sabina.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, Madam, that is my name: Alas! I am the la&s;t that bear it: Tho&s;e that did honor to it once are now no more: I am a mi&s;erable &s;olitary relict.</P>

<SPEAKER>Fred.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sabina, you &s;hall &s;pare your&s;elf the pain|ful recital: Lady Ruby, if I rightly know her, is not curious to inquire into the private hi&s;tories of the unfortunate.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady R.</SPEAKER>
<P>In point of idle curio&s;ity, I hope you do me no more than ju&s;tice; but to know misfor|tunes for the purpo&s;e of relieving them, permit me to &s;ay that I am curious.&mdash;If Mademoi&s;elle Ro&s;ny &s;hou'd prefer the protection of one of her own &s;ex to her pre&s;ent &s;ituation, my heart and hou&s;e are open to receive her.</P>

<P>What &s;ay you, amiable Sabina? I am, like you, a &s;olitary woman: will you con&s;ent to be my companion and friend?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sabina.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have all po&s;&s;ible empre&s;&s;ment for your goodne&s;s, and certainly &s;o charming a lady cannot fail to have a tender heart for the unhappy; but I am without a friend in England, except this worthy gentleman, and I do think he will advi&s;e me for the be&s;t. It &s;eems to me that you are not quite e&s;trang'd to one another: Mr. Mowbray is very honorable and good to poor me; I pray you let me hear what he will &s;ay.</P>

I am now going to my father&mdash;I need not &s;ay how much my fate de|pends upon that interview.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sabina.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no, no! I do once more pray and implore of you, Mr. Frederick, not to &s;peak of me to your father: I have rea&s;ons for that, which it would be great pain and difficulty for me to expli|cate to you; but, &s;ince my lady is &s;o good to per|mit me to come to her, I do pray you let me avail my&s;elf of her kind favor, and then, when I will make my confe&s;&s;ion to her, you &s;hall find your&s;elf very happy that you have not &s;poken to your father.</P>

<SPEAKER>Sir Miles.</SPEAKER>
<P>To be &s;ure, that's the way to be un|der&s;tood, &s;on Wrangle; whereas to be verbo&s;e and circum&s;tantial, is to be tedious; and when a man is tedious, you know, 'tis ten to one if his hearers are not tir'd with his preamble, before he lets them into the body of his bill.</P>

<SPEAKER>Sir Miles.</SPEAKER>
<P>I don't &s;ay it does, I don't &s;ay it does; yet a fault it is, lie where it will, and every man has his faults, which it is the part of a friend to tell him of, it is the part of a father&mdash;You your&s;elf are not without faults, &s;on Wrangle.</P>

<LG>
<L>Ah woe the time! and, therefore, 'tis I &s;ee</L>
<L>So many pitying eyes are turn'd on me;</L>
<L>So kind they look, as if they wou'd impart</L>
<L>Some of their own brave &s;pirit to my heart:</L>
<L>And where's the wonder, as the ca&s;e appears,</L>
<L>If tho&s;e who rule the waves &s;hou'd calm our fears?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Oh! generous nation, pardon if I &s;ay</L>
<L>What my poor thoughts &s;ugge&s;t in my poor way;</L>
<L>But I do think that Heav'n ordain'd a ne&s;t</L>
<L>On your white cliffs where halcyon peace may re&s;t,</L>
<L>Sever'd one &s;pot of con&s;ecrated ground,</L>
<L>And bade old Neptune roll his waves around:</L>
<L>Then put his trident in Britannia's hand,</L>
<L>And gave the watery world to her command;&mdash;</L>
<L>And &s;he &s;hall hold it for all time to come,</L>
<L>Tho' hair-brain'd prophets may denounce her doom;</L>
<L>For &s;ure I am, the ruler of the wind</L>
<L>Will never harm the friends of human-kind.</L>
<L>But it is not for humble me to &s;peak</L>
<L>Of things &s;o great, with faculties &s;o weak;</L>
<L>Enough that when I came, for&s;aken, poor,</L>
<L>A wand'ring emigrant, and &s;ought your door,</L>
<L>Your generous favor gave me a retreat</L>
<L>Where the Mu&s;e haunts, and where the Graces meet,</L>
<L><PB REF="70">
Where beauty and benevolence unite</L>
<L>To cheer the &s;oul and animate the &s;ight,</L>
<L>Where from the <HI>fond&eacute;</HI> of the &s;upporting pit,</L>
<L>Row above row the Briti&s;h worthies &s;it,</L>
<L>Pre&s;enting to the view a &s;plendid ring,</L>
<L>Firm to their Country, loyal to their King;</L>
<L>And proving, by the grace with which they're pleas'd,</L>
<L>That the be&s;t Critics &s;oone&s;t are appeas'd.</L>
