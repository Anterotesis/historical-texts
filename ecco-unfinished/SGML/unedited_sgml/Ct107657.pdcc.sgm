<HEAD>THE TWINS, OR, THE FEMALE TRAVELLER.</HEAD>
<P>_IN the reign of Queen Anne, who&s;e memory is &s;till dear to millions, there lived in the county of Glou|ce&s;ter a merchant, who had acquired by traffick a &s;ufficient fortune to make him ea&s;y the remainder of his days. He was ble&s;t by heaven with a tender wife, and two lovely children, a &s;on and daughter; beautiful twins, &s;o like each other, as not to be di&s;tingui&s;h|ed without a &s;trict examination. Their educa|tion and early promi&s;e of virtue, gave the utmo&s;t joy to the fond parents.</P>
<P>The indulgent father (not caring to tru&s;t his darling &s;on Frederick out of his &s;ight) well know|ing that in common &s;chools, youth often imbibe vice that plunges them into evils too &s;tubhorn to be conquer'd, provided a tutor for him in his own hou&s;e, whom we &s;hall call Mentor; where, in a few years, he drank &s;uch large draughts of learning, that he was able to in&s;truct others.</P>
<P>But what was more extraordinary, his beauti|ful &s;i&s;ter Lucretia equall$d him in every branch of learning, unle&s;s in tho&s;e robu&s;t exerci&s;es that did not become the tenderne&s;s of that delicate &s;ex.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="3">The parents, happy as this world could make them in two &s;uch lovely children, were the joy and delight of all that had the happine&s;s to know them; and would often dre&s;s their blooming daughter in her brother's cloaths, to innocently impo&s;e on their frequent vi&s;itants, who&s;e com|mon mi&s;takes would create mirth for the whole company.</P>
<P>Thus the time pa&s;s'd away in virtuous plea|&s;ures, 'till the admired twins had reach'd their fourteenth year, without the lea&s;t cloud of &s;or|row to damp their joys; but before the year was expired, death &s;natch'd the virtuous mother from an incon&s;olable hu&s;band, and lamenting children, who notwith&s;tanding their learning, had not phi|lo&s;ophy enough to &s;top their &s;ighs, or dry their tears. However time, that wears away memory, or removes it at a greater di&s;tance (for if grief were to continue with the &s;ame force that it be|gins, the &s;tronge&s;t and wi&s;e&s;t per&s;on upon earth could not bear it) drove away ince&s;&s;ant &s;orrow, tho' whole ages would never obliterate the cau&s;e of their grief.</P>
<P>The pious father, now fixt his only future Comfort upon the loved pledges &s;he had left be|hind her, and began to think it was time his &s;on &s;hould travel to improve his ob&s;ervations of the world, tho' it was a new death to think of parting with him. His former traffick to &s;everal di&s;tant climates, with an unblemi&s;h'd character, had gain'd him friends in mo&s;t places of Europe, where he intended his &s;on &s;hould vi&s;it; but the &s;or|rows, &s;ighs and tears that were &s;hed at parting of the Father, Son, and Si&s;ter, are not to be ex|pre&s;s'd in words; and their parent a thou&s;and times repented the fatal &s;eparation. However,
<PB N="5" REF="4">
the appointed day arrived, which we will draw a veil over to hide their tender parting.</P>
<P>In company with our young traveller, went a relation, who&s;e name was Ferdinand, a young|er brother to an ancient family, much of the &s;ame age, and the &s;ame promi&s;es of growing virtue; which was &s;ome con&s;olation for the terrible part|ing with his dear father, and lovely &s;i&s;ter, who had now pa&s;s'd the age of &s;eventeen; a time dangerous to the amiable &s;ex, adorn'd with beau|ty, and endow'd with fortune; yet
<Q><L>When love's well tim'd, 'tis not a Fault to love;</L>
<L>The &s;trong, the brave, the virtuous and the wi&s;e,</L>
<L>Sink in the &s;oft captivity together.</L></Q></P>
<P>But the lea&s;t particle of that flame had not yet reach'd her brea&s;t; &s;he was courted by many, even with the con&s;ent of her father, who told her, that he would not have her give her hand, but where &s;he could be&s;tow her heart. Lucretia thank'd him for his tender regard he had for her peace and repo&s;e, yet begg'd &s;he might not turn her mind to think of the wedlock-&s;tate; repeating at the &s;ame time the&s;e lines:
<Q><L>O let not marriage tempt me to my ruin.</L>
<L>Tru&s;t not to man; they are by nature fal&s;e,</L>
<L>Di&s;&s;embling, &s;ubtle, cruel, and incon&s;tant:</L>
<L>When a man talks of love, with caution hear him;</L>
<L>But if he &s;wears, he'll certainly deceive me.</L></Q>
Well! my child, reply'd the father, I am well plea&s;ed at thy caution; it &s;hows thy wi&s;dom; but then, in an&s;wer to your author, I mu&s;t reply in the poetic &s;train, tho' a thing I am &s;eldom prone to.
<Q><PB N="6" REF="5">
<L>When hearts and minds are pair'd above,</L>
<L>There is no harmony like love.</L></Q>
Alas! my dear father, return'd the daughter, were we to &s;earch the <HI>Poets</HI>, we could find many arguments on both &s;ides; therefore I once more beg we may drop the &s;ubject, and grant me more time e'er I launch on the turbulent &s;ea of ma|trimony, that too often proves the &s;hipwreck of our peace; for I mu&s;t own, the various lovers that pretend to offer me their vows, &s;eem mon|&s;ters all, and ready to devour me. I have no room yet in my brea&s;t, but duty for you, and a &s;i&s;terly love for my dear brother; therefore I once more beg you wou'd di&s;mi&s;s 'em all, who knows, but &s;ome quarrel may en&s;ue, and blood may be the con&s;equences, which would kill my peace of mind for ever.</P>
<P>The father was &s;o much moved with her good &s;en&s;e and open heart, that he comply'd with her de&s;ires, and di&s;mi&s;s'd her retinue of lovers with all the decency he could, yet all would not take his coun&s;el to withdraw; two of them &s;till wou'd force them&s;elves into the hou&s;e; and being both powerful men, of good education and fortunes, the father, without the breach of ho&s;pitality and good manners, could not decently get rid of them; neither had he indeed any objection to ei|ther of them for a &s;on-in-law, but his daughter's aver&s;ion to wedlock, which time might remove. <HI>Lucretia</HI> &s;till follow'd her &s;tudies &s;o ardently, as if &s;he had every thing to learn, which gave her father &s;ome unea&s;ine&s;s, fearing it &s;hould impair her health; therefore, he prevail'd upon her to learn mu&s;ic and dancing; the latter &s;he had learnt, when a child, but had been &s;o thir&s;ty af|ter
<PB N="7" REF="6">
knowledge of a &s;ublimer &s;tamp, that had thru&s;t it out of her memory; however, to plea&s;e &s;o good a father, at proper times, &s;he learnt of her ma&s;ters, and &s;oon attain'd perfection both in mu&s;ic and dancing. I have &s;een mu&s;ic and &s;ongs of her own compo&s;ition, that would not di&s;credit the greate&s;t ma&s;ters.</P>
<P>Now two months were &s;tole away, and no tydings from our young travellers, which gave the utmo&s;t terror to the father and the fair <HI>Lu|cretia</HI>, who expected to hear from him weekly. This &s;evere di&s;appointment, with the vexation and importunity the young ladies two lovers gave her, almo&s;t di&s;tracted her. The father &s;ent to all his former corre&s;pondents abroad; but their an&s;wers gave no information, either of him, or his companion. <HI>What a wretch</HI>, wou'd the father cry, <HI>was I to part with my dear &s;on, the &s;taff of my declining age! and &s;end him to meet a fate that might have been avoided</HI>; yet &s;ometimes the flatterer hope, would &s;teal in and comfort them; that a thou&s;and accidents might fall to prevent their hearing from him.</P>
<P>The continual agitations of the mourning fa|ther's mind wrought &s;o much upon him, that the decay of his body &s;eem'd to denote a di&s;&s;olu|tion from his &s;oul, and the image of death ap|pear'd before him. When he found he was &s;um|mon'd to the eternal regions, he call'd his lovely daughter to approach his bed, who attended, all drown'd in tears. <HI>I am going</HI>, (&s;aid her fa|ther) <HI>to pay that debt we all are bound to nature. Grief for the lo&s;s of my beloved &s;on, has ha&s;ten'd my journey, for I am convinced he is no longer in this world; had he a being here, I am a&s;&s;ured by
<PB N="8" REF="7">
this time, we &s;hould have heard from him. Thou, my lovely and &s;urviving child, mu&s;t dry thy tears, when I am laid in earth. Remember the dead are happy, freed from the cares and troubles of the world. The living mourn for them&s;elves; mo&s;t of the pangs I feel are from leaving thee behind; but thy knowlodge and virtue will, I hope, &s;u&s;tain thee from the fallacious mazes of this world, and guide thy unerring &s;teps. I have fini&s;h'd my will in thy behalf, where all I have is thine, &s;ave a few le|gacies to my faithful &s;ervants.&mdash;See my corps be laid in the &s;ame grave with my dear wife, and heaven for ever ble&s;s thee!</HI> After this he mur|mur'd to him&s;elf a &s;hort prayer, and &s;ent his la&s;t breath into the bo&s;om of his lovely daughter, who was ready to accompany him in death, with the weighty burthen of her &s;orrows.</P>
<P>Now was this amiable creature left an orphan, tho' the care of her fortune, by her father's will, was entirely at her own di&s;po&s;al, without a guardian, tho' &s;he had but ju&s;t reach'd her 18th year. Never child &s;hew'd a more &s;incere &s;or|row for a parent's lo&s;s than &s;he did; yet her good &s;en&s;e inform'd her, tears could not revive the dead.</P>
<P>Mentor, her brother's tutor, remain'd &s;till in the hou&s;e, and prov'd very &s;erviceable to her in &s;ettling her affairs. Bu&s;ine&s;s is often an allay to grief, while idlene&s;s and &s;loth nouri&s;h vice; yet all her worldly affairs could not bury the melancholy thoughts of her father and brother's death.</P>
<P>After her time of bu&s;ine&s;s &s;eem'd over, her two trouble&s;ome lovers began to try if her father's death had not alter'd her mind; but all their eloquence could not prevail; &s;he appear'd more
<PB N="9" REF="8">
inflexible than ever; gave them to under&s;tand that &s;he was mi&s;tre&s;s of her&s;elf, would remain &s;o, and not put her liberty in the power of ano|ther. One of them took this as a final denial, but the other, either being more in love, or re&s;olving to be more ob&s;tinate, plagued her &s;till with his pa&s;&s;ion; and when he could not &s;ee her, pe&s;ter'd her with loving epi&s;tles, which &s;he has con&s;tantly committed to the flames. Finding the&s;e had no effect, he had recour&s;e to &s;tratagems; but all were baffled by the good conduct of the virtuous young lady. At la&s;t, by bribes to one of her maids, he gain'd admittance into her apartment in the night, and after intreaties fail'd, would have u&s;ed force; but the courageous lady, &s;natch|ing up a pi&s;tol from the window, drove him with his trembling fears out of the hou&s;e, and the next morning turn'd her faithle&s;s &s;ervant after him.</P>
<P>For &s;ome time &s;he heard no more of him; but one morning early walking in her garden to in|dulge her &s;orrows, &s;he was of a &s;udden &s;eiz'd by three fellows, and this impious lover at the head of them. He gain'd by his gold the key of the garden, thro' the means of that treacherous &s;ervant &s;he had turn'd away. When he had hurry'd the poor lady out of the garden un&s;een by any, he forced her on hor&s;eback, and thro' by-roads brought her to a hou&s;e in a forre&s;t, &s;uitable to his barbarous intention, tho' adorn'd with water, woods and lawns; when the wretch had &s;ecur'd Lucretia in a chamber, he let her know there &s;he &s;hould remain, till &s;he con&s;ented to marry him, and fixt the time within the month; and if &s;he would not con&s;ent, when that time was expired, he would try another method. The &s;orrowful Lucretia made him no reply,
<PB N="10" REF="9">
which &s;o provoked the Knight, he &s;ullenly left her to her own thoughts; but to make an ad|dition to her grief, he &s;ent the very wretch to attend her, that had brought her to this calamity.</P>
<P>The virtuous Lucretia, tho' in this di&s;tre&s;s, drew courage out of hone&s;ty, and determin'd to &s;uffer death, rather than lo&s;e her honour; nei|ther did the mon&s;ter's threats di&s;arm her of her rea&s;on. Her &s;oul was too great to &s;hed tears on this occa&s;ion. She re&s;olved to try the di&s;hone&s;t attendant, and as gold had corrupted her to a deed that was vicious, &s;he had &s;ome hopes, it might turn the ballance on the &s;ide of virtue, but to no purpo&s;e, the wretch delighted more in evil than good, and told her plainly, &s;he was glad it was in her power to be reveng'd of her for putting her out of her &s;ervice.</P>
<P>How do'&s;t thou know, reply'd Lucretia, but I may comply with this furious man, and make one article in our agreement to puni&s;h thee! where is then they hope, or revenge?</P>
<P>Why indeed, reply'd the wretch, there is &s;ome rea&s;on in what you &s;ay, but I know you &s;o well, I am a&s;&s;ured you will not puni&s;h your&s;elf, as you call it, to puni&s;h me, therefore I will &s;tick to my fir&s;t principle; be&s;ides I have the be&s;t part of my reward before-hand.</P>
<P>This reply, &s;truck the poor lady dumb, how|ever, her thoughts were not idle, and the more to indulge them; &s;he turn'd her face towards the window that look'd over the garden wall into a footpath that run thro' the wood, where &s;he per|ceiv'd her Mentor in di&s;gui&s;e of a pea&s;ant, ob|&s;erving the avenues to the hou&s;e: Her heart was reviv'd at the &s;ight, &s;he took an opportunity to &s;hew her&s;elf, while the maid was in the out|ward
<PB N="11" REF="10">
room, and by &s;igns gave him to under&s;tand &s;he dur&s;t not &s;peak to him. She had a pencil in her pocket, and a &s;mall book call'd the <HI>Govern|ment of the Tongue</HI>, written by the Author of the <HI>Whole Duty of Man</HI>. She tore out a blank leaf and wrote the following lines.</P>

<CLOSER><SIGNED>LUCRETIA.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>When the note was fini&s;h'd, &s;he wrapt it about her bodkin, threw it over the wall with all her &s;trength, and had the &s;atisfaction to &s;ee him take it up, but her vile attendant coming in that mo|ment, &s;he dur&s;t not ob&s;erve more. The innocent Lucretia at this di&s;covery &s;eem'd better pleas'd; hope dawn'd in her countenance, and ca&s;t a lu&s;tre over her clouded beauty, which was taken notice of by her attendant.</P>
<P>Why madam, cry'd this wicked woman, your mind &s;eems more compos'd than it was, I fancy we &s;hall reconcile you to your fortune, women's pa&s;&s;ions are of &s;hort duration, I don't doubt but you'll forgive the Knight, and then a pardon for me comes of cour&s;e. I can't tell, reply'd the lady, our fate will be obey'd.</P>
<P>The &s;ervant ran immediately to acquaint her ma&s;ter with this &s;eeming good news, who made as much ha&s;te to be inform'd of the reality from Lucretia's own mouth, who gave him &s;uch doubtful an&s;wers that &s;eem'd to cheri&s;h hope more than de&s;pair; he began to make excu&s;es
<PB N="12" REF="11">
for his proceeding, and lay the fault on his ex|ce&s;s of love. Left her with tran&s;ports in his countenance that &s;eem'd to &s;ay he did not doubt his happine&s;s.</P>
<P>There was a <HI>Harp&s;icord</HI> in the chamber, and the more to deceive 'em, &s;he &s;at her down and &s;ung the following &s;ong, the words and mu&s;ic of her own compo&s;ing.
<Q><L>The &s;ight of meads, and purling &s;treams,</L>
<L>Will &s;ooth the &s;orrows in my brea&s;t,</L>
<L>Come balmy &s;lumbers, chearful dreams,</L>
<L>And lull my troubled &s;oul to re&s;t.</L></Q>
Her <HI>mu&s;ic</HI>, and harmonious voice, &s;oon drew the knight to li&s;ten to her &s;ong, with raptures. He told his wicked a&s;&s;ociate that a day or two more her mind would be &s;et at re&s;t, and he did not doubt but in a little time &s;he would be di&s;|pos'd to make him happy.</P>
<P>When &s;he had done &s;inging, he enter'd the room, paying her a thou&s;and ful&s;om compli|ments on her voice, &amp;c. which &s;he &s;eem'd not to be di&s;pleas'd with, but beg'd he would give her leave to re&s;t, to recover her fright, and fa|tigue. This the knight took as a good omen, af|ter making &s;everal ridiculous compliments, &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ively retir'd, taking her attendant along with him; but had caution enough to lock the door of her outward appartment, and put the key in his pocket. This was ob&s;erved by the lady, with no little concern; however, &s;he was at more lei&s;ure to comtemplate her misfortune. She of|ten look'd with wi&s;hing eyes towards the wood for the tutor, but in vain. While &s;he was think|ing, with her back towards the window, &s;he
<PB N="13" REF="12">
heard &s;omething &s;trike again&s;t it, and fall down in the garden, &s;he look'd out, yet could not per|ceive any one that threw it; but to her mortifi|cation, beheld a paper under the window. She was at her wits end; for if the Knight found it, &s;he knew her &s;cheme of liberty would prove abortive. But as heaven ever guards the good and ju&s;t, &s;he was put out of this dilemma, by ob&s;erving a reil of fi&s;hing lines on the chimney-piece, and as Lucretia had often taken that inno|cent diver&s;ion, &s;he hoped to &s;ucceed in her under|taking; &s;he took off one of the longe&s;t lines from the reel, which was loaded with lead near the hook, and after many e&s;&s;ays brought up the dangerous letter. She open'd it with trembling hands, aad found as follows.</P>

<P>If this note had fallen into the hands of the Knight, all had been prevented, but now &s;he went to re&s;t, after a &s;light repa&s;t, and &s;lept with a heart more at ea&s;e. In the morning &s;he ro&s;e early, dre&s;t her&s;elf, and waited with impatience for the hour of her freedom. The appointed time came, but no deliverer appear'd, what was her anxiety!
<PB N="14" REF="13">
when the morning dawn'd, and no hopes of li|berty, the whole long, long day, and en&s;uing night pa&s;t in the &s;ame tedious expectation, but to no purpo&s;e, nor in all that time had &s;leep once clos'd her eye-lids.</P>
<P>In the middle of the third night, while &s;he was addre&s;&s;ing her prayers to heaven, &s;he was di&s;turb|ed in her meditations with the noi&s;e of her door being broke open, with the greate&s;t violence, when four men ma&s;k'd, and di&s;guis'd, enter'd her apartment; their leader took off his vizard, when &s;he knew him to be her long expected Mentor. Her tran&s;port of joy was &s;o great that not knowing what &s;he did, &s;he embraced him with the utmo&s;t tenderne&s;s: <HI>My dear deliverer</HI>, cry'd &s;he, <HI>art thou come at la&s;t, when all hopes were fled? My deare&s;t lady</HI>, reply'd <HI>Mentor, lo&s;e no time, but follow me, I'll tell you as we go the rea|&s;on of my delay</HI>. When they came to the garden wall, they help'd her over by a ladder to the o|ther &s;ide, mounted her behind the tutor, and rode as fa&s;t as their hor&s;es could carry them, ne|ver &s;topping till they arrived at the lady's hou&s;e. The moment &s;he was taken off her hor&s;e, the fatigue, want of re&s;t, and the former troubles of her &s;oul, threw her into a &s;woon, her maid &s;er|vants put her to bed, and it was &s;ome hours e'er they could bring her to a &s;en&s;e of her liberty; but when &s;he was a&s;&s;ured of her &s;afety at home, among her own &s;ervants, &s;he would not ta&s;te food, or repo&s;e before &s;he had thank'd Mentor for the &s;ignal &s;ervice he had perform'd: &s;he reach'd from her cabinet a bank bill of five hundred gui|neas, which with great reluctance he accepted: <HI>I am over paid, madam</HI>, &s;aid he, <HI>in the action, good deeds are rewarded in them&s;eles</HI>. He then
<PB N="15" REF="14">
proceeded to tell her in what manner he accom|pli&s;h'd his de&s;ign, and the rea&s;on of his delay in the execution. 'When I left your lady&s;hip, or rather the hou&s;e where you was impri&s;on'd, I went home in order to prevail upon your tenants to a&s;&s;i&s;t me in gaining your freedom, but found I had a harder ta&s;k than I at fir&s;t imagin'd; mo&s;t of them had &s;cruples, &s;ome thro' fear, and others guided by intere&s;t, alledging if they were found out, the Knight was a per&s;on of that power, he would find means to ruin them for their a&s;&s;i&s;t|ing you, and it was two full days e'er I could bring matters to bear. Be&s;ides one of the per|&s;ons that gave us his a&s;&s;i&s;tance had brought a letter directed to your father; but hearing of his death, all the per&s;ua&s;ions I was ma&s;ter of could not prevail upon him to deliver it to me, or tell me who he brought it from, and is re&s;olv'd to give it into no hands but your own.'</P>
<P>This account rais'd Lucretia's curio&s;ity, &s;he &s;ent for the per&s;on upon the in&s;tant, who appear|ed in the habit of a &s;ailor, tho' a carriage and behaviour that &s;poke him above the common &s;ort. As &s;oon as he enter'd, he &s;aid, "Madam, I know the fatigue and fears you have been in, will not allow this a proper time to read the contents of &s;o long a letter, therefore, I beg you will defer it till the morning, when re&s;t has com|pos'd your mind and body." "Sir, return'd the lady, before I know the purport of that letter, I am well a&s;&s;ured re&s;t, or food, mu&s;t be a &s;tranger to me, therefore I beg you will not keep me any longer in the uncertain &s;tate of doubt." The me&s;&s;enger deliver'd the letter, &s;he examin'd the direction, but could not find out the hand. She broke it open with &s;ome emotion, and ca&s;ting
<PB N="16" REF="15">
her eye upon the name at bottom, gave a great &s;hriek, and fainted on the bed, where &s;he &s;at; when &s;he reviv'd, &s;he ki&s;s'd the name, and cry'd it was from her dear brother! &s;he then proceeded to read the contents, which were as follows.</P>

<P>I Doubt not but you will be &s;urpriz'd at my long &s;ilence, and to receive this letter not of my own writing; but to clear that, a wound I receiv'd in my right hand obliges me to employ a friend upon this occa&s;ion. You know, my dear father, we &s;et &s;ail with a fair wind, which continued till we lo&s;t &s;ight of my dear native country. The third day a violent &s;torm aro&s;e, and we were compell'd to beat it about for fourteen days, &s;ubmitting to the mercile&s;s winds and waves, and when it abated we found our&s;elves in the bay of <HI>Bi&s;cay,</HI> to&s;s'd to and fro in &s;uch a manner by the &s;well of the &s;ea, (tho' the winds were hu&s;h'd) that we were in danger of being &s;hipwreck'd for &s;everal days. When the weather prov'd favourable, and the bil|lows &s;eem'd gone to re&s;t, we pur&s;ued our voyage for the coa&s;t of <HI>France;</HI> but in the du&s;k of the even|ing perceiv'd a ve&s;&s;el, that &s;eem'd to labour to &s;peak with us; we were not prepar'd for an enemy, there|fore in the night chang'd our cour&s;e, put out all our lights, in hopes to get from them; but when the morning dawn'd, we found our caution was to no purpo&s;e, for the ve&s;&s;el was not half a league off: Our chief hopes were, that &s;he might prove a friend, but to our mortification, &s;oon di&s;cover'd her <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> colours. We crouded all our &s;ails to get from her, but the wind falling, our ve&s;&s;el made but little way, and our pur&s;uers making u&s;e of oars, &s;oon came within gun-&s;hot; we had but &s;ix &s;mall guns on board,

however the captain re&s;olv'd to defend him&s;elf, and the pa&s;&s;engers came into that re&s;olution. The fir&s;t di&s;charge of their cannon, and &s;mall arms, &s;hot down her colours, which I being eager to rai&s;e again, was wounded in the right hand by a mu&s;ket ball, and our captain kill'd at the &s;ame time, with two &s;uitors and a pa&s;&s;enger; we return'd their fire, but did 'em but little damage, and we all thought it was the wi&s;e&s;t way to &s;ubmit, for re&s;i&s;tance would prove but in vain. They on the in&s;tant enter'd our &s;hip, and made prize of us. The captain of this freebooter was an <HI>Iri&s;hman,</HI> and us'd us with the greate&s;t humanity, ordered his &s;urgeon to dre&s;s my wound, and gave me all the accommodation his ve&s;|&s;ell could afford. The prize did not an&s;wer his expectation, however that made no alteration in his kind treatment; nay he told us &s;everal times, as &s;oon as he arriv'd in <HI>Spain,</HI> our ran&s;oms &s;hould be very moderate, and he would &s;end us home with the fir&s;t conveniency. This generous u&s;age lighten'd our &s;orrows, but it would not heal the grief of my wound, nor the anxiety I felt, that I could not in|form my dear father and &s;i&s;ter of my misfortune. I acquainted the captain with my troubles, who wrote a letter ready to be given any <HI>Dutch</HI> or <HI>French</HI> ve&s;&s;el we might meet with thro' the <HI>Straits,</HI> for he was bound for <HI>Barcelona,</HI> the capitol city of <HI>Cata|lonia,</HI> one of the <HI>Provinces</HI> of <HI>Spain</HI>. But e'er we could make the <HI>Straits</HI> of <HI>Gibraltar,</HI> two <HI>Al|gerine</HI> rovers pur&s;ued us, and after a terrible fight, we were a &s;econd time taken, and fell into much wor&s;e hands than our other ma&s;ters, for our ob&s;ti|nate defence made them treat us with the utmo&s;t barbarity, which in generous &s;pirits ought to have created e&s;teem. Our new tyrants cruiz'd about the <HI>Straits Mouth</HI> three weeks to no purpo&s;e, therefore

made &s;ail for the port of <HI>Algiers,</HI> where they were receive$ with the utmo&s;t joy by the inhabitants. My compa$ion and I, with our two &s;ervants, were bought of an hone&s;t <HI>Moor,</HI> that had formerly been in <HI>England</HI> with <HI>Hamet</HI> the <HI>Amba&s;&s;ador;</HI> he &s;poke tolerable <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> treated us very well, and agreed with us for a thou&s;and pounds, and fifty yards of cloth &s;carlet, as he call'd it, for our ran|&s;om, ordering our letters to be ready to &s;end to our friends in <HI>England,</HI> with the &s;oone&s;t. In the mean time, we wanted nothing but our liberty, and other &s;laves were treated with humanity; therefore I think the &s;tories of the many hard&s;hips captives un|dergo, cannot be all truths. Provi&s;ions are very plentiful, and good at <HI>Algiers</HI>. We had not been pri&s;oners a fortnight, e'er the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> captain came to us, and made propo&s;als concerning our liberty; he inform'd us he had prevail'd with twelve other &s;laves, the en&s;uing night, to run away with a &s;mall ve&s;&s;el in the port, and if we would accompany him, he would carry us into <HI>Spain,</HI> and from thence give us our liberty; in &s;hort, we agred, every thing &s;uc|ceeded to our wi&s;hes, and we are now &s;afe in the city of <HI>Barcelona</HI> in <HI>Spain</HI>. The bearer will in|form you, my dear father, the rea&s;on of my &s;tay here.

I hope this long letter will come time enough to prevent &s;u&s;picions of my death, and find you both in health and happi|ne&s;s, which &s;hall be the daily prayer and wi&s;hes of your mo&s;t dutiful &s;on,</P>

</LETTER>
<P><HI>Heaven be truly prai&s;ed</HI>, cry'd the lovely Lu|cretia, <HI>for this news, but I fear, my brother, the

knowledge of our dear father's death, will &s;hock thy tender &s;oul, with ever living &s;orrow. My bro|ther informs my father in the letter, you will ac|quaint us with the rea&s;on of his &s;tay at</HI> Barcelona. <HI>Madam</HI>, reply'd the me&s;&s;enger, <HI>his love detains him there, love of as fair a lady as ever</HI> Spain <HI>produced, their hearts are firmly united; and if your father had been living, I was to have return'd with his con&s;ent, and brought the happy couple to pay their duty at his feet. What then, are they already wedded, &s;aid the lady. No, madam</HI>, re|ply'd the me&s;&s;enger, <HI>the lady loves your brother &s;o well, that &s;he would not have him do any thing to break the bonds of duty</HI>. At this, they broke off their di&s;cour&s;e, and all retir'd to their repo&s;e. The next morning the young lady &s;eem'd very thoughtful, taking &s;everal turns about her chamber, as if her mind was ruminating on &s;omething very extraordinary; which her maid ob&s;erving, a&s;k'd her what it was that di&s;turb'd her? but had no other an&s;wer, than, go call <HI>Mentor</HI>, and the me&s;&s;enger that brought the let|ter from my brother. When they came in, and were &s;eated, by her order, &s;he look'd upon 'em both alternately, for &s;ome moments, then broke her &s;ilence in this manner: <HI>I am going to declare an affair, that will very much &s;urprize you; I am re&s;olved to embark with the &s;oone&s;t for</HI> Spain, <HI>to vi&s;it my brother and his lovely mi&s;tre&s;s; but to do it with as much decency as po&s;&s;ible, I intend to di&s;|gui&s;e my &s;ex</HI>. This declaration very much &s;ur|prized indeed, her two auditors; in vain they laid the hazards and dangers of the attempt be|fore her; &s;he overturn'd all their arguments by per&s;i&s;ting, and they had nothin$ $word$ do, but to prepare for their voyage. In th$ days every
<PB N="$$" REF="19">
thing was ready, and at night they &s;et out for <HI>Dover</HI>, where they intended to wait for a ve&s;&s;el to <HI>Calais</HI>; for the lady's intention was to travel thro' <HI>France</HI>, and embark for <HI>Spain</HI>, at <HI>Mar&s;eilles</HI>; the war between <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Spain</HI> prevented her voyage in an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> ve&s;&s;el. When they landed at <HI>Calais</HI>, they hired po&s;t chai&s;es, and in &s;ixteen days arrived at <HI>Mar&s;eilles</HI>, without any accident on the road.</P>
<P>As <HI>Lucretia</HI>, with <HI>Mentor</HI>, the me&s;&s;enger and the &s;ervants were viewing the gallies, a young gentleman, of a noble mein, ran up to her, ki&s;s'd her, and embraced her with &s;uch rap|tures, that &s;he could not immediately di&s;engage her&s;elf from his arms. The &s;udden &s;urprize quite confounded her, and &s;he was at a lo&s;s how to behave. My dear friend (cry'd the gentleman) how came you to <HI>Mar&s;eilles</HI> before me, whom I left at <HI>Barcelona? Lucretia</HI> made no an&s;wer, her &s;urprize was &s;o great; but her attendants inter|po&s;ing, convinced the gentleman he was mi&s;|taken, tho' it was &s;ome time before he could be|lieve his eyes. The lady &s;oon recollected her|&s;elf, and did not doubt, by his mentioning <HI>Bar|celona</HI>, but this gentleman was an acquaintance of her brother's, and might be ea&s;ily mi&s;taken thro' their prodigious likene&s;s. A &s;ecret &s;atis|faction &s;tole into her brea&s;t, which at la&s;t appear|ed in her countenance.</P>
<P>The gentleman begg'd pardon for his rude mi&s;take; but Sir, &s;aid he, you &s;o much re&s;em|ble a dear friend I have left in <HI>Spain</HI>, that I &s;hou'd be proud of your acquaintance; in &s;hort, the lady was re&s;olved to invite them to her lodg|ings, and t$ together, that &s;he might be fur|ther inform $word$ her beloved brother.</P>
<P><PB N="2$" REF="20">The young gentleman &s;oon con&s;ented to her propo&s;al of &s;upping together; and there being conveniencies in the &s;ame hou&s;e, he made an agreement with the landlord for an apartment contiguous to <HI>Lucretia</HI>'s. He went on board the ve&s;&s;el for his &s;ervants and goods (for he was bu$ ju&s;t arriv'd when he met <HI>Lucretia</HI>) order'd them to the &s;ame hou&s;e, and thought him&s;elf happy with his new acquaintance. When they were at &s;upper, the gentleman could not keep his eyes off <HI>Lucretia</HI>. "Sir, &s;aid he, the more I look or you, the more I di&s;cover the likene&s;s of my friend in every feature; all the difference is, your com+plexion is more fair, and your voice has more &s;oftne&s;s in it." Pray Sir, &s;aid <HI>Lucretia</HI>, who i$ this friend of yours? The gentleman proceede$ to acquaint her with all &s;he knew already, whic$ we need not repeat; extoll'd the beauty of th$ lady, who&s;e perfections of the mind were equa$ to her outward charms. "My friend <HI>Frederic$</HI> told me, &s;aid the gentleman, he had &s;ent a me$+&s;enger to his father and &s;i&s;ter, to acquaint the$ with his &s;tory; but his long delay, or perha$ his death, makes him fear they have not receive his Letter." 'Tis true, reply'd the me&s;&s;eng$ that &s;at at &s;upper, my voyage was longer than expected; but you know I told you mada$ (looking at the lady) we were detain'd by co$+trary winds, or you would have had your br$+ther's letter &s;ooner. This unexpected &s;peech p$ the lady's tutor into &s;uch confu&s;ion, that <HI>Ferd$+nand</HI>, for it was he, had opportunity to exami$ their countenances, and &s;oon found out the trut$&punc;</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding their endeavours to &s;moth it, a &s;ilence of &s;ome minutes e$ued; the lady blu&s;hes, and the me&s;&s;enger's anxiety for letti$

his tongue betray the &s;ecret, confe&s;&s;ed all. Good heaven! cry'd out <HI>Ferdinand</HI>, and can it be the lovely &s;i&s;ter of my dear friend, the fair <HI>Lucre|tia</HI>, whom I have heard him mention with &s;o much tenderne&s;s; for heaven's-&s;ake, madam, re|cover your confu&s;ion; the &s;ecret &s;hall be for ever lock'd up in my brea&s;t, you &s;hall command my life: And tho' I was going to <HI>England</HI> to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of an ample fortune by the death of an elder brother, who&s;e death I much lament, yet you mu&s;t give me leave to attend you back to <HI>Barcelona</HI>, where you will meet your brother. This &s;peech gave the lady time to recover her|&s;elf a little. Sir, &s;aid &s;he, I tru&s;t you with this &s;ecret, which I am a&s;&s;ured your friend&s;hip for my brother will prevail upon you to keep; but mu&s;t not prevent your journey to <HI>England</HI>, by $our return with me to <HI>Barcelona</HI>. I would obey $ll your commands but this, replied <HI>Ferdinand</HI>, be&s;ides I may render you &s;ome little &s;ervices when we arrive there. Many compliments pa&s;s'd $etween this amiable couple, and <HI>Lucretia</HI> did $ot &s;eem di&s;plea&s;ed that he conquered all her $rguments again&s;t his not returning with her: $he ve&s;&s;el was not ready to &s;ail for <HI>Barcelona</HI> $or many days, and every day <HI>Ferdinand</HI> be|$$me more in love; yet in all this time his eyes $nly declared his pa&s;&s;ion; his tongue was mute $word$ that &s;ubject. One day as they were diverting $em&s;elves on the river, turning a point of land, $ boat met theirs &s;o violently, that with the &s;ud|$n &s;hock they were forc'd into the water. There $ere &s;ome ladies in the other boat, that were $ry much concer$ed at the accident, and order|$ their waterm$$ to give their a&s;&s;i&s;tance. <HI>Fer|$and, Mentor</HI>, the me&s;&s;enger, and &s;ervants,
<PB N="$$" REF="22">
&s;aved them&s;elves by &s;wimming, but poor <HI>Lu|cretia</HI> &s;unk to the bottom. <HI>Ferdinand</HI> &s;eeing her danger, plunged after her, and with the greate&s;t difficulty brought her to &s;hore, even with the hazard of his life. The ladies in the other boat being near a villa of their own, had their whole company conducted there, in order to recover the fright, and &s;hift their wet cloaths. <HI>Lucretia</HI> tho' very feint, was in the utmo&s;t di&s;tre&s;s at this accident, for fear of a di&s;covery; and her lover <HI>Ferdinand</HI> &s;eemed to be in &s;ome perplexity. So when they arrived at the hou&s;e, which was near the river-&s;ide, mens cloaths were provided for every body but <HI>Lucretia</HI>; and the &s;i&s;ters &s;ent her a woman's habit to put on, which &s;he could not forbear &s;miling at. She dre&s;t her&s;elf with the greate&s;t ha&s;te, and came out with her hair loo&s;e about her &s;houlders. The &s;i&s;ters were &s;urprized at her beauty, and genteel mien in a woman's dre&s;s, and paid her a great many compliments upon it. One of the ynung ladies undertook to dre&s;s her head, and dry her hair, ornamenting it with jewels, and flowers, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> After this, &s;ome refre&s;hment was prepared; but when the company met together, <HI>Ferdinand</HI> was &s;o charm|ed with <HI>Lucretia</HI>, in her proper dre&s;s, that the &s;i&s;ters took notice of it. Don't you think, &s;aid the lady, I have taken &s;ome pains with your friend? I prote&s;t when I look in the gla&s;s, I am a&s;hamed of my-&s;elf, to be outdone in beauty by one of the contrary &s;ex. The&s;e prai&s;es rai&s;ed a blu&s;h in the face of <HI>Lucretia</HI>, which <HI>Ferdinand</HI> perceiving, changed the di&s;cour&s;e. After dinner, they diverted them&s;elves in the garden, 'till it was time to think of going back to <HI>Mar&s;eilles</HI>. Their cloaths being now dry, every one put on
<PB N="24" REF="23">
their own; and the ladies would have their &s;er|vants accompany them to &s;ee them &s;afe to their lodgings. When <HI>Lucretia</HI> open'd her pur&s;e, af|ter coming to her lodgings, to gratify the &s;ervants for the trouble they had undergone on their ac|counts, &s;he was &s;urpriz'd to find a paper with a hand&s;ome diamond ring in it. The note con|taian'd the following words:
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE><HI>SIR,</HI></SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THERE are many in&s;tances of per&s;ons being &s;truck with love at fir&s;t &s;ight; I have a for|tune large enough to make you happy, if happine&s;s can con&s;i&s;t in money. When I braided tho&s;e charm|ing locks, I twi&s;ted fetters for my heart, to bind me your eternal &s;lave. This declaration is again&s;t the rule of our &s;ex's mode&s;ty; but what rules can be &s;et to love? I beg you will wear the inclo&s;ed trifle for my &s;ake, tho' I took the freedom to open your pur&s;e unknown to you, which you left in the clo&s;et where you undre&s;t; it was only thus to declare my love, and offer you my heart, with my fortune, which is independent. Con&s;ider of it; but then con&s;ider, your &s;lights, or refu&s;al, will be the death of one, who will not live, but for you.</P>
</LETTER></P>
<P>The amazement and confu&s;ion in her counte|nance, was ob&s;erved by her faithful lover, who almo&s;t gue&s;s'd the &s;ecret, for lover's eyes are quick &s;ighted; however &s;he confirm'd his &s;u&s;pi|cions, by giving it him to read, &s;aying at the &s;ame time, "Alas! what a fatal mi&s;take is this? Fatal indeed, madam, reply'd <HI>Ferdinand</HI>, (re|turning the letter) but it mu&s;t be the fate of all who look upon you." This declaration pro|nounced &s;o unexpectedly, threw a blu&s;h of &s;hame
<PB N="25" REF="24">
and anger into <HI>Lucretia</HI>'s face; &s;he gave him no an&s;wer, but went out of the apartment with re|&s;entment, leaving the poor lover in the utmo&s;t terror of de&s;pair. The perplexities this affair, with that of the letter, had almo&s;t made her for|get the &s;ervants whom &s;he had order'd to attend below. She gave her re&s;pects to the ladies, and bid the &s;ervants tell them &s;he would come the next day once more to thank them for their good|ne&s;s. After this <HI>Lucretia</HI> retir'd to her apart|ment, and went to bed, without &s;upping with <HI>Ferdinand</HI>, as u&s;ual; but re&s;t was a &s;tranger to her: &s;he &s;ometimes thought &s;he ought not to be cruel to a man who &s;aved her life, at the hazard of his own; but then &s;he imagin'd that was the cau&s;e of his pre&s;umptious love; the more &s;he thought, the more &s;he found excu&s;es in his fa|vour, however &s;he determin'd to make her voyage to <HI>Barcelona</HI> without him, tho' it was &s;ome time before &s;he could come to that re&s;olution. The next morning the captain of the ve&s;&s;el came to acquaint them he &s;hould be ready to &s;ail the next day; every thing was order'd to be ready, with the utmo&s;t privacy, to conceal it from her lover.</P>
<P><HI>Lucretia</HI> &s;eem'd plea&s;ed with the thought of em|barking without him, yet at the &s;ame time, there was too much cruelty, &s;he imagin'd in her inten|tion. However, &s;he was re&s;olv'd to &s;atisfy the lady, it was out of her power to return her love, by revealing her &s;ex. Orders were given to <HI>Mentor</HI> to provide a boat, for the re&s;t of her peo|ple were bu&s;y in preparing for their voyage. The river is &s;o rapid in many places that pa&s;&s;en|gers go out, and let the boatmen tow the ve&s;&s;el up again&s;t the &s;tream: the 2d time <HI>Lucretia</HI> and <HI>Mentor</HI> landed, the rope broke, and the boat with
<PB N="26" REF="25">
the &s;teer&s;man alone, was drove with the force of the &s;tream above a mile back, till it was thrown upon a bank of &s;and; the two watermen that were on &s;hore, were obliged to go back in order to help her off, while <HI>Lucretia</HI> with <HI>Mentor</HI> re|&s;olved to walk &s;lowly on, to &s;tay for them at the next place they were to go on board. They wait|ed two hours, and no boat appear'd; this delay gave them &s;ome unea&s;ine&s;s, therefore they de|termin'd to pur&s;ue their journey by land, which was not above two miles farther; but the &s;un growing hot, obliged them to re&s;t in a little <HI>Cabaret</HI> on the road. They had not been there a quarter of an hour, before they ob&s;erved a &s;er|vant of the ladies, where they intended to go, very bu&s;y in di&s;cour&s;e with a gentleman, who held an open letter in his hand as they pa&s;s'd by the <HI>Cabaret</HI>; the &s;ervant ca&s;t his eyes upon <HI>Lu|cretia</HI>, and cry'd to the per&s;on that was with him, <HI>that's the very gentleman!</HI> and both pa&s;s'd the hou&s;e. Our di&s;guis'd lady could not apprehend what they meant, yet &s;eem'd a little unea&s;y, tho' &s;he knew not for what, yet conceal'd her appre|hen&s;ions from <HI>Mentor</HI>, who did not ob&s;erve what pa&s;s'd. A few minutes after, <HI>Mentor</HI> went to|wards the water-&s;ide to look for the boat; he had not gone forty paces e'er the gentleman, that had pa&s;s'd by with the &s;ervant, enter'd the <HI>Cabaret</HI>, came up to <HI>Lucretia, Sir</HI>, &s;aid he, <HI>I de&s;ire a word in private</HI>, and at the &s;ame time, took her by the &s;leeve of her coat, leading her a little roughly in|to the garden of the <HI>Cabaret; Lucretia</HI> was &s;o full of confu&s;ion, that her pre&s;ence of mind for&s;ook her, and &s;he follow'd in&s;en&s;ibly.</P>
<P>When they came to the mo&s;t retir'd part of the garden, the gentleman drew his &s;word, <HI>come, Sir</HI>,
<PB N="27" REF="26">
&s;aid he, <HI>draw! I have no time to lo&s;e! I mu&s;t puni&s;h the lady that loves you, by thy death&iexcl; I have di&s;|covered her pa&s;&s;ion for you by the letter &s;he &s;ent you ju&s;t now, her &s;ervant brought it to me, and I ought to hate her for loving a per&s;on at the fir&s;t &s;ight, after &s;lighting all my vows and a&s;&s;iduities for years toge|ther. There's the letter</HI> (continued the gentleman, throwing it upon the ground) <HI>if you long to read it, you mu&s;t kill me fir&s;t, then you may peru&s;e it at your lei&s;ure, and vi&s;it the ungrateful fair, who dies every moment till &s;he &s;ees your face. Wou'd to heaven, &s;he never had, then time might have melted her hard heart, and di&s;po&s;ed her to have re|warded my con&s;tant affection</HI>. During this &s;peech, poor <HI>Lucretia</HI> was full of the utmo&s;t terrors, and trembling with agonies, which the gentleman ob&s;erving, cry'd, <HI>What art thou then a coward? and dare&s;t pre&s;ume to love? defend thy-&s;elf, or I'll &s;tab thee through thy timerous heart</HI>. Hold, pro|phane wretch! cry'd <HI>Ferdinand, Lucretia</HI>'s gene|rous lover, who that moment appeared with his &s;word in his hand, and hurt not that precious life! This &s;udden interruption &s;omewhat &s;ur|prized the &s;tranger; however, as <HI>Ferdinand</HI>'s &s;word was oppo&s;ed again&s;t him, they made &s;eve|ral furious pa&s;&s;es at each other, 'till at la&s;t the &s;tranger was di&s;arm'd, without receiving any wound on either &s;ide. Ju&s;t as the combat was fini&s;h'd, <HI>Mentor</HI> came in, wi$h the ladies they were going to vi&s;it, which he &s;topp'd, as they were pa&s;&s;ing by in their coach! <HI>Lucretia</HI> &s;eeing them, put her hand to her face to hide her con|fu&s;ion, but however, was re&s;olved to di&s;cover her&s;elf, to end all di&s;putes, for the &s;tranger &s;eem'd to harbour rancour in his heart again&s;t her. <HI>La|dies</HI>, (&s;aid Lucretia) <HI>I have endangered my life
<PB N="28" REF="27">

<P>The different countenances at this di&s;covery, cannot be de&s;crib'd; however an hour's conver|&s;ation reconcil'd the affair; the lady prevailed upon <HI>Lucretia</HI> to keep the ring in commemoration of this affair, accepting at the &s;ame time one from her. The lady's lover &s;ued a pardon from <HI>Lu|cretia</HI>, in &s;uch terms, that &s;eem'd to promi&s;e fair|er for his mi&s;tre&s;s's heart than all his former vows had done; and they took leave of each o|ther with mutual promi&s;es of remembrance. When <HI>Ferdinand</HI> and <HI>Lucretia</HI> were &s;eated in the boat, that waited for them, they were &s;ilent for &s;ome time, he daring not to lift his eyes up to her face. <HI>Lucretia</HI> at the &s;ame time began to lo&s;e &s;ome part of her rigour, for a man, that perhaps had twice &s;aved her life. What was his crime? love! a virtuous love, and from a man who&s;e rank and fortune might de&s;erve her. <HI>Men|tor</HI> ob&s;erv'd them both, and attributed <HI>Lucretia</HI>'s &s;ilence to her late fear, and by <HI>Ferdinand</HI>'s taci|turnity imagin'd he might have receiv'd &s;ome hurt. <HI>Come, Madam</HI>, (&s;aid <HI>Mentor</HI> to <HI>Lucretia) your fears are now over, be chearful. No,</HI> Mentor, reply'd <HI>Lucretia, not while I keep on this habit; I never once thought of the dangers I am liable to by wearing it; this la&s;t adventure might have been fatal, had it not been prevented by the timely a&s;|&s;i&s;tance of this gentleman</HI>, pointing to <HI>Ferdinand.

This morning</HI>, reply'd Ferdinand, <HI>when I aro&s;e, I was inform'd by our landlord, that the lady with you were gone up the river; I own I in&s;tinctively follow'd, for my mind &s;eem'd to forbode &s;ome dan|ger might attend you; I got into another boat, and follow'd till we came to that of yours, which the men had ju&s;t &s;et clear from the &s;and-bank; by them I was inform'd which way you went, I landed, and pur&s;ued the &s;ame path; when I came within a hun|dred paces of the</HI> Cabaret, <HI>I took notice of two per&s;ons bu&s;y in di&s;cour&s;e, one of them cry'd out with tran&s;port!</HI> Wou'd to heaven the &s;tripling villain had been &s;wallow'd by the waves e'er <HI>I&s;abella</HI> had &s;een his face! <HI>After this &s;peech they parted, and the gentleman proceeded with ha&s;ty &s;teps to|wards the</HI> Cabaret, <HI>which he enter'd before I could overtake him; you know the re&s;t, and I &s;hall think this day one of the happie&s;t of my life</HI>. &mdash; Here ca&s;ting his eyes on <HI>Lucretia</HI>, they encounter'd hers, who with a mode&s;t blu&s;h, turn'd a&s;ide to hide her confu&s;ion; it was plain to <HI>Mentor</HI> love was kindling in her heart, which did not di&s;|plea&s;e him, knowing both their virtuous inclina|tions. <HI>Lucretia</HI>, before &s;he got to their lodgings, began to repent her de&s;ign of going to <HI>Barcelona</HI> without <HI>Ferdinand</HI>, and wi&s;h'd &s;he had never &s;et that re&s;olution. Alas! Love will make a great progre&s;s in a little time; when once the gates of the heart is open, he ru&s;hes in like a torrent, till every corner is fill'd with the plea&s;|ing pa&s;&s;ion. <HI>Lucretia</HI> &s;eem'd more a&s;hamed of her di&s;gui&s;e than ever, began to think it &s;ome &s;tain to mode&s;ty, &s;ince her &s;oul was fill'd with the ideas of love, and wonder'd at her&s;elf &s;he had not found it before; however, now it was too late, for the next morning was fix'd for their

embarking. It was with &s;ome &s;hame <HI>Lucretia</HI> look'd upon <HI>Ferdinand</HI> in the morning, when they enter'd the ve&s;&s;el, tho' &s;he was a&s;&s;ured no one knew of her de&s;ign to go without him but her&s;elf; in &s;hort, before they arrived at <HI>Barce|lona, Lucretia</HI> gave <HI>Ferdinand</HI> hopes &s;he would not prove inexorable. The a&s;&s;iduous lover did not let a moment pa&s;s without declaring his pa&s;|&s;ion, till by mutual con&s;ent they exchanged hearts, and &s;he promis'd if her brother con&s;ent|ed, one day &s;hould join all their hands. Never were two lovers more happy, with regard to virtue, for I dare an&s;wer for'em both, there was not a vicious thought within either of their &s;ouls.</P>
<P>The favourable wind, and weather, made the voyage to <HI>Barcelona</HI> &s;hort, though it &s;eem'd tedi|ous to <HI>Ferdinand:</HI> it was late in the evening e'er they were landed, therefore they were oblig'd to take up their lodgings at an inn. In the morn|ing, <HI>Lucretia</HI> told <HI>Ferdinand</HI> &s;he intended to &s;ur|prize her brother, therefore begg'd he would bring him to the inn without acquainting him of her arrival. The lover &s;eem'd pleas'd with the de&s;ign, and went immediately to find out <HI>Frederick</HI>. We mu&s;t now leave <HI>Ferdinand</HI> and <HI>Lucretia</HI>, and give a &s;hort account of the amour between <HI>Frederick</HI> and the lady he was in love with.</P>
<P>When the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> captain arrived at <HI>Barcelona</HI> from <HI>Algiers</HI>, from whence they had made their e&s;cape; he treated the two gentlemen with the utmo&s;t genero&s;ity, and being obliged to return to &s;ea again to follow his employment, he left them ma&s;ters of his hou&s;e during his ab&s;ence, with orders to his &s;ervants to receive all their

commands as if they were given by him&s;elf, in|tending at his return, to carry them to <HI>Mar&s;eilles</HI> in his own ve&s;&s;el.</P>
<P>The Captain before he embark'd, brought <HI>Fer|dinand</HI> and <HI>Frederick</HI> acquainted in &s;everal fa|milies, that they might pa&s;s their time with more &s;atisfaction; mo&s;t of the&s;e new acquaintance did not regard the &s;tiff formal cu&s;toms of the <HI>Spaniards</HI>, for their families were originally ei|ther <HI>Engli&s;h, Scots</HI>, or <HI>Iri&s;h</HI>, therefore the ladies were not coop'd up as they generally are in <HI>Spain</HI>; 'tis true, they were all of the <HI>Roman</HI> religion, yet they never offer'd to make converts of their gue&s;ts. <HI>Donna Leonora</HI>, was one of this amiable compa|ny; her father not long &s;ince dead, had left her a fortune upwards of 800,000 crowns; yet her per&s;on was beyond expre&s;&s;ion beautiful, not to be equall'd, but by the charms of the mind: <HI>Fre|derick</HI>'s heart &s;oon felt the impre&s;&s;ion of her image, yet was plung'd into de&s;pair, when he was in|form'd the governor's &s;on, <HI>Don Lopez</HI> was his ri|val; a per&s;on potent for him to cope withal, and he too often had the mortification to find &s;he re|ceived his addre&s;&s;es without any di&s;plea&s;ure. The pains of his mind brought a di&s;order on his body, and he was &s;eiz'd with a violent fe|ver. <HI>Ferdinand</HI> his companion, knew the &s;ource of his di&s;temper, therefore encouraged him to love on; <HI>'tis time enough to de&s;pair</HI>, &s;aid he, <HI>when &s;he has refus'd your vows.

was going to reply, word was brought, &s;everal gentlemen and ladies were come to vi&s;it him, among the re&s;t <HI>Donna Leonora</HI> enter'd, conducted by <HI>Don Lopez</HI>. The &s;ight agitated the mind of poor <HI>Frederick</HI>, that the blood bur&s;t out of his no&s;e. <HI>Leonora</HI> &s;tood next the bed, gave him her handkerchief to &s;top it, which he re|ceived with a trembling hand; but that was at|tributed to his weakne&s;s, by all but <HI>Don Lopez</HI>, who was ob&s;erved by <HI>Ferdinand</HI> to change colour &s;everal times. When the company was gone, <HI>Ferdinand</HI> told his friend the ob&s;ervation he had made, and further, the concern <HI>Leonora</HI> &s;eem'd to &s;hew at the accident; adding, <HI>I am convinced &s;he loves you</HI>.</P>
<P>O flatterer, reply'd <HI>Frederick</HI>, but I forgive your friend&s;hip; you mean it well, we are too apt to believe what we wi&s;h; in &s;hort, our lover became a little more compo&s;ed, and in two days he had &s;trength enough to walk about his apart|ment. The third day, he received the vi&s;its of his acquaintance, to congratulate the recovery of his health; but neither <HI>Don Lopez</HI>, or <HI>Leonora</HI> came, which much &s;urprized him. When the company retired, a &s;ervant brought him a letter, which he &s;aid required an an&s;wer. He broke open the &s;eal with &s;ome emotion, and read as follows:

While they were di&s;|cour&s;ing on this &s;ubject, another letter was de|liver'd to him, which he knew to be <HI>Leonora</HI>'s hand; he trembled at breaking open the &s;eal, and his weakne&s;s was &s;uch, that his friend was obliged to &s;upport him.</P>

This tender &s;cene was interrupted by the entrance of <HI>Ferdinand</HI> and <HI>Pedro</HI>, who&s;e joy was beyond ex|pre&s;&s;ion to find him &s;afe. <HI>Leonora</HI> at their pre|&s;ence endeavoured to hide a little of that tender|ne&s;s &s;he had in her heart for her dear <HI>Frederick</HI>; but like the &s;un breaking thro' a cloud, her eyes would &s;hine upon him. 'And why &s;hould they not? their hearts were united; by fate de&s;tined to each other, and their vows regi&s;ter'd in hea|ven. However, <HI>Leonora</HI> could not lull the troubles of her heart to re&s;t, till they arrived that evening at her country &s;eat. Nothing but plea&s;ures and diver&s;ions were thought of; but amid&s;t all, <HI>Frederick</HI> remember'd his father, and amiable &s;i&s;ter, di&s;covering to his lovely <HI>Leonora</HI> all his circum&s;tances, and the fears that mu&s;t &s;urround 'em for this life, in not hearing from him in &s;o long a time. When <HI>Donna Leonora</HI> under&s;tood every thing, &s;he &s;aid, 'My dear <HI>Fre|derick</HI>, though I love you more than my own life, yet our nuptials mu&s;t be deferr'd till you have the con&s;ent of &s;o tender a father. It &s;hall be my care to provide a proper me&s;&s;enger, and as you are incapable of writing your&s;elf, thro' the wound in your hand, if you will dictate, I will be your Amanuen&s;is, provided you do not mention any thing of our loves, but leave that to <HI>Pedro</HI>, whom I intend &s;hall be the me&s;&s;enger: Mo&s;t of the families in <HI>Barcelona</HI>, that you are acquainted with, have kept up the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> lan|guage. <HI>Pedro</HI> by making &s;everal voyages with my late worthy father, and living in the family,

under&s;tands it perfectly well. If you will give him proper directions, he &s;hall prepare for his voyage tomorrow.' Every thing was agreed to, and the letter was wrote by the lovely <HI>Leonora</HI> (which you have read already) <HI>Pedro</HI> embark'd the next day, in a &s;hip bound for <HI>Mar&s;eilles</HI>, but by a violent &s;torm was blown on the coa&s;t of <HI>Africa</HI>, and obliged to wait for a fair wind, in the port of <HI>Oran</HI>, full &s;ix weeks. In the mean time, the lovers and friends pa&s;s'd their hours with the utmo&s;t contentment at <HI>Leonora</HI>'s coun|try hou&s;e, without the lea&s;t mole&s;tation, or hear|ing from <HI>Don Lopez</HI>. But to &s;et <HI>Leonora</HI>'s heart intirely at re&s;t, they had news brought them that the governor of <HI>Barcelona</HI> had &s;ent him to <HI>Madrid</HI>, to &s;ollicit a place at court. In the mid&s;t of their joys, the generous <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> captain return'd from his voyage, and had taken &s;everal rich prizes from the <HI>Algermes</HI>, to be revenged on them for their late captivity, and redeem'd a great number of chri&s;tian &s;laves, one of which he had taken into his &s;ervice. The captain being in|form'd where his gue&s;ts were, went to vi&s;it them with his new &s;ervant. The &s;ervant no &s;ooner ca&s;t his eyes on <HI>Ferdinand</HI>, but he cry'd out with the utmo&s;t tran&s;port, <HI>What do I &s;ee! my dear ma&s;ter, that I have been &s;eeking the&s;e four months! Ferdinand</HI> &s;oon knew him to be the favourite &s;ervant of his brother; he enquired after his health, but the me&s;&s;enger inform'd him with a melancholy countenance, he had been laid in the tomb of his ance&s;tors above four months, dying of a violent and &s;udden fever: Tho' a very large fortune de&s;cended to <HI>Ferdinand</HI> by his death, he could not help &s;hedding tears for the lo&s;s of &s;o good a brother, ever indulgent to him.</P>
<P><PB N="42" REF="41">The &s;ervant inform'd him he embark'd on a &s;mall ve&s;&s;el bound for <HI>Diep</HI>, in order to &s;earch for him in &s;ome of the cities in <HI>France</HI>; but were chas'd by a <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> privateer, near that port, and taken, but before they arriv'd at <HI>St. Seba&s;tians</HI> (where they were bound) they were retaken by a rover of <HI>Barbary</HI>, and within the <HI>Straits</HI>, were met with by the valiant <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> captain, who after a terrible engagement boarded the rover, who &s;urrender'd after the lo&s;s of three parts of his men; thus was I the third time a pri&s;oner, but releas'd by the genero&s;ity of the captain, who took me into his &s;ervice; and now, continued the &s;ervant, I think my&s;elf at the heighth of happine&s;s in finding my dear ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>It was nece&s;&s;ary <HI>Ferdinand</HI> &s;hould make a voy|age to <HI>England</HI> with the &s;oone&s;t, to &s;ettle his af|fairs, that requir'd his &s;peedy pre&s;ence; when the time of his departure came, it proved a me|lancholly day to him and the two lovers he left behind him. They &s;aw him on board, and re|tir'd to <HI>Leonora</HI>'s town-hou&s;e, not fearing any thing in the ab&s;ence of <HI>Don Lopez</HI>; waiting with impatience for the return of <HI>Pedro</HI>, who had ex|ceeded his limited time.</P>
<P>We will now return to <HI>Ferdinand</HI> and <HI>Lucre|tia</HI>, whom we left at the inn, with <HI>Mentor</HI> and <HI>Pedro</HI>, the me&s;&s;enger, who had orders not to ap|pear, for fear of being known. When <HI>Ferdin|and</HI> came to the hou&s;e of <HI>Donna Leonora</HI>, he was &s;omething &s;urpriz'd to find all in darkne&s;s; how|ever, he rung the bell, and a &s;ervant open'd the door, who inform'd him his mi&s;tre&s;s was at her country &s;eat, with <HI>Don Frederick</HI>, (as he call'd him) who is ill with &s;ome wounds he has lately received. This intelligence gave <HI>Ferdinand</HI>
<PB N="43" REF="42">
very great concern, tho' by all his enquiry, he could not learn who he had fought with. When he return'd to the inn, he cautiou&s;ly examin'd the ma&s;ter of the hou&s;e, but he found by his an&s;wers he was ignorant of the matter; he re|turn'd to <HI>I&s;abella</HI>'s again, without &s;eeing his dear <HI>Lucretia</HI>, to know if the &s;ervant could give him any further light into this affair: 'Sir, &s;aid the &s;ervant, all I know is that <HI>Don Frederick</HI> was wounded, but is now much better, and I know it is kept as a &s;ecret, therefore I &s;hould not have di&s;cover'd it to you, if you had not been one of his be&s;t friends.' <HI>Ferdinand</HI> was plea&s;ed that he was out of danger, yet could not dive into the my&s;tery; however, he return'd to his ador'd <HI>Lucretia</HI>, and told her tenderly of this unlucky affair, which drew tears in her eyes; they re|&s;olved the next morning to go as privately as po&s;&s;ible to <HI>Leonora</HI>'s country-hou&s;e, they hired a coach and mules, and &s;et out by break of day.</P>
<P>While they were upon the road, they were contriving how they &s;hould di&s;cover <HI>Lucretia</HI> to her brother, fearing if it was &s;udden, the &s;trong emotion might endanger his health; however, they had not determined which way to proceed, when they arrived at the gate; but you may gue&s;s <HI>Ferdinand</HI>'s &s;urpri&s;e, when the fir&s;t per&s;on he ca&s;t his eyes on was <HI>Don Lopez</HI>, very p$le and wan, looking out of the window, but retir'd on the in&s;tant. Heaven! &s;aid <HI>Ferdinand</HI>, loud e|nough to be heard by <HI>Lucretia</HI>, How &s;hall I &s;olve this riddle! She was &s;urpriz'd at the&s;e words, and a&s;k'd him the meaning of it. Madam, re|ply'd <HI>Ferdinand</HI>, I'm all amazement! but beg you will &s;tay in the coach, while I enter the hou&s;e to be better inform'd of what I &s;ee, if my

eyes have not deceived me. The &s;ervants were over-joy'd when they beheld <HI>Ferdinand</HI>, and flew into the garden, to acquaint <HI>Donna Leonora</HI> and <HI>Frederick</HI> with the welcome news. <HI>Ferdinand</HI>, follow'd 'em; when the two lovers perceiv'd him, they ran with open arms to embrace him. Their joy, for &s;ome time, made them forget to a&s;k him the meaning of this &s;udden return, for they knew it was impo&s;&s;ible he &s;hould have been &s;o far as <HI>England</HI>, and back again. <HI>Fer|dinand</HI> demanded fir&s;t, if his dear friend's wounds were heal'd? Yes, thank heaven, reply'd <HI>Donna I&s;abella</HI>, but I am amazed how you came to know any thing of that unhappy accident. Well, return'd <HI>Ferdinand</HI>, perhaps I may &s;ur|prize you more; I have brought &s;ome friends to vi&s;it you, if you will retire to an apartment, I'll bring them one by one to you. <HI>Frederick</HI> and <HI>I&s;abella</HI>, full of expectation, enter'd the hall with|out returning him an an&s;wer; the fir&s;t that was introduced was <HI>Pedro</HI>, whom the good-natur'd <HI>Frederick</HI> embraced, a&s;king at the &s;ame time, how his dear father and &s;i&s;ter fared? Here is one that can inform you better, reply'd <HI>Ferdinand</HI>, introducing <HI>Mentor</HI>. Heavens! my dear tutor! cry'd <HI>Frederick</HI>, am I awake, and do I indeed embrace the man that led my wandering &s;teps to virtue and learning! I hope, reply'd <HI>Mentor</HI>, em|bracing him, among your other &s;tudies, you have learnt philo&s;ophy, and re&s;ignation to the will of heaven, in hearing lo&s;&s;es patiently: We are all born to die &mdash; your father &mdash; is dead, re|ply'd <HI>Frederick</HI>! the be&s;t of fathers! and of men! my ab&s;ence has brought death to cut the thread of his life. Allow me, my dear <HI>I&s;abella</HI>, to pay this tribute of my tears to his rever'd memory.
<PB N="45" REF="44">
The whole company could not refrain from weeping, at his filial &s;orrow; after &s;ome time allow'd for grief, he wiped his eyes, and enquired after his dear &s;i&s;ter. Sir, reply'd <HI>Ferdinand</HI>, I have another gentleman to introduce, that &s;aw her la&s;t, and can give the be&s;t account of her. He went out, and return'd leading <HI>Lucretia</HI> by the hand; at her &s;ight, <HI>Frederick</HI> was &s;truck with a&s;toni&s;hment, and wonder ty'd his tongue; <HI>I&s;a|bella</HI> cry'd out it mu&s;t be &s;he! my dear &s;i&s;ter; &s;he is too much like the image in my heart to be mi&s;taken. The tran&s;ports of this tender meeting over-whelm'd &s;ome part of <HI>Frederick</HI>'s grief for his father's death. Some hours were &s;pent in re|lating their hi&s;tories to each other; but <HI>Ferdinand</HI> intreating <HI>Frederick</HI> to let him into the meaning of what he &s;aw in the window, before he enter'd. If you have &s;een <HI>Don Lopez</HI> here, reply'd <HI>Frede|rick</HI>, I know it mu&s;t &s;omething &s;urprive you; I'll reveal it to you in a few words: After you you were embark'd on your intended voyage, my dear <HI>Leonora</HI> and I retir'd to this place, to be out of the hurry of <HI>Barcelona</HI>; one morning early amu&s;ing my&s;elf with <HI>angling</HI>, till my lovely <HI>I&s;a|bella</HI> was dre&s;t, a fi&s;herman pa&s;&s;ing by in a boat, gave me this letter, which you may read.</P>

<P>When I read this note, I own, I could not re&s;i&s;t the call of pity for his unhappy pa&s;&s;ion, and &s;incerely wi&s;h'd to avoid this meeting, but it could not be; the tyrant honour appear$d before me, and drove away compa&s;&s;ion. When I met my dear <HI>Leonora</HI>, &s;he took notice that my coun|tenance was di&s;order'd, however, I conceal'd every thing from her, ro&s;e in the morning by break of day, and got in the wood without be|ing ob&s;erv'd by any one, where I found the im|patient <HI>Don Lopez</HI>, in a mean habit; he turn'd &s;hort towards the inner part of the wood, and I follow'd without &s;peaking to each other; when we came to a little green plat, he &s;top'd, and turn'd upon me, <HI>this is the &s;pot</HI>, &s;aid he, <HI>where one of us mu&s;t leave his life:</HI> We both drew our &s;words and daggers, giving and receiving &s;eve|ral wounds, at la&s;t I had the good fortune to run him thro' the body; he fell, and faintly &s;aid, 'You have conquer'd me, and approaching death will cure the wound <HI>Leonora</HI>'s eyes made, and as I mu&s;t not enjoy her, live and be happy with. &mdash; At that word he fainted, I was too weak to give him a&s;&s;i&s;tance; therefore I made all the ha&s;te I could to <HI>Leonora</HI>'s, as &s;oon as I got in, I directed the &s;ervants where he lay, and order'd 'em to bring him as gently as po&s;&s;ible, which they did. I need

not repeat the agonies poor <HI>Leonora</HI> was in; &s;he order'd a coach immediately, and went her&s;elf for a &s;urgeon, he found I had no dangerous wound, when I was dre&s;t, he &s;earch'd tho&s;e of <HI>Don Lopez</HI> and promis'd &s;ome hopes of life. To make &s;hort of my hi&s;tory, we both recover'd, but <HI>Don Lopez</HI> is not able to go abroad; he is &s;o grateful for the u&s;age he has received here, that he has conquer'd his pa&s;&s;ion, and wi&s;hes us ble&s;t in each other.</P>
<P><HI>Lucretia</HI> now de&s;ired &s;he might put off for ever the habit of a man, that had given her &s;o much unea&s;ine&s;s, which was &s;oon done with the a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance of her dear &s;i&s;ter; <HI>Leonora</HI> di&s;po&s;ed of her effects in <HI>Spain</HI>, and re&s;olved to go with her lover to <HI>England</HI>, the land of liberty. When <HI>Don Lopez</HI> heard of the&s;e &s;trange events, he begg'd leave to come among them, that he might pay his grati|tude, his per&s;on was tall, genteel and well made, tho' his lo&s;s of &s;o much blood made him appear pale and wan; when he enter'd the apartment, the whole company ro&s;e to &s;alute him, he was &s;ur|prized at the beauty of <HI>Lucretia</HI>, who was now dre&s;s'd in her proper habit. 'I have been inform'd (&s;aid <HI>Don Lopez</HI>) that the women of <HI>England</HI> are <HI>Angels</HI>, and if they are all like you, my Inform|ation is true. I wi&s;h you all the happine&s;s heaven can be&s;tow upon you, and beg I may have the honour to join tho&s;e hands who&s;e hearts I know have long been united'.</P>
<P>The two ladies blu&s;h'd at this &s;peech of <HI>Don Lopez</HI>, but as their lovers were de&s;tin'd for their hu&s;bands, why &s;hould they delay their happine&s;s, <HI>Frederick</HI> gave his con&s;ent that <HI>Ferdinand</HI> &s;hould wed his &s;i&s;ter, with a dowry equal to his fortune, but he valued not fortune; but as riches are e&s;|&s;ential to worldly happine&s;s, they &s;hould not be

neglected; but all the wealth on earth cannot be a ble&s;&s;ing without the pairing of hearts and mind. The day was fix'd for their nuptials, which were &s;olemnized in private; <HI>Don Lopez</HI> was father to both the happy couples. In a few days after, <HI>Leonora</HI> di&s;po&s;ed of her E&s;tate at <HI>Barcelona</HI>, &amp;c. which amounted to near two hundred thou&s;and pounds; rewarded the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Captain according to his merit, embark'd on board his &s;hip for <HI>Mar|&s;eilles</HI>, with all their &s;ervants; paid a vi&s;it to <HI>I&s;a|bella</HI>, the lady who fell in love with <HI>Lucretia</HI>; found her wedded to her lover; journeyed from thence to <HI>Calais</HI>, arrived &s;afe in their own coun|try, where (after they had &s;ettled a hand&s;ome pen&s;ion for life on <HI>Mentor</HI>, bountifully rewarded the &s;ervant, and faithful <HI>Pedro</HI>, who &s;till dwells in the Family) they now live among their te|nants and neighbours, happy in a numerous race of prattling innocents, patterns of their parents virtues.</P>
