<P>MINISTERS in all countries are very cau|tions, and very carele&s;s&mdash;In France, as well as England, they lock up letters and &s;tate papers in <HI>Green boxes;</HI> but &s;ometimes the&s;e boxes are not well taken care of&mdash;it was to this caution, and this carele&s;&s;ne&s;s, that I am indebted for the di&s;covery of Mon&s;ieur <HI>De Sartine's</HI> politics. For, about &s;ix weeks &s;ince, a bro|ther Jacobin and my&s;elf, in our morning rounds, called at Mademoi&s;elle <HI>Du Th&eacute;'s.</HI> Madamoi&s;elle's femme de chambre, a little arch brunette, who&s;e eyes &s;eemed to require ab&s;olution, having opened the door, engaged the attention of my companion; &s;o that, without any inquiries from the maid, I &s;lipped up &s;tairs, to be of e|qual &s;ervice to the mi&s;tre&s;s. The toilet door being open, I walked in, in hopes of finding her there; but I &s;oon &s;aw my mi&s;take; for, upon one of the &s;ophas I di&s;covered a chapeau de bras and &s;word; which ex|citing my curio&s;ity, I examined the room more clo&s;ely, and, behind the veil of the gla&s;s, to my great delight, I perceived a <HI>Green box.</HI> In &s;hort, Mon&s;ieur De Sar|tine, who had come late from his Maje&s;ty, was, at that moment, in Madamoi&s;elle Du Th&eacute;'s arms, while his <HI>Green box</HI> was in mine; and I leave you to think which of the two was the be&s;t plea&s;ed. I immediately &s;natch|ed up this trea&s;ure of &s;ecrecy, and, hiding it under my gown, without di&s;turbing my brother, who was occu|pied in devotion, I ha&s;tened home to &s;tudy politics. I own, at fir&s;t, I had &s;ome &s;cruples about opening the
<PB N="4" REF="3">box, but I reflected how much it was the duty of my profe&s;&s;ion to di&s;cover all &s;ecrets; and, I argued, that, if it was profane, even in kings, to conceal their thoughts from their confe&s;&s;ors, a mini&s;ter who locked up his &s;ecrets mu&s;t be an enemy to religion, and, if not him|&s;elf, certainly his <HI>Green box</HI> &s;hould be put to the <HI>que|&s;tion.</HI>&mdash;But, why reveal the&s;e &s;ecrets? It's fair to di&s;co|ver, but not to di&s;clo&s;e them.&mdash;To this I an&s;wer, that the papers them&s;elves mu&s;t be my defence&mdash;Po&s;&s;ibly, &s;ome critics may, at fir&s;t, be inclined to compare Sar|tine's box to Pandora's, and the editor to a &s;econd E|pimetheus; but they will &s;oon do me the ju&s;tice to make &s;ome di&s;tinction between us. It was not till <HI>af|ter</HI> he had opened his box that war and di&s;cord broke forth; but all the mi&s;chief was done in France, long <HI>before</HI> I opened M. Sartine's. The fable &s;ays, Hope alone re&s;ted at the bottom: An allegory, very flatter|ing to the Editor of the <HI>Green box.</HI>&mdash;In &s;hort, if the&s;e papers &s;how how little rea&s;on we have to depend on the French mini&s;try, or the Engli&s;h oppo&s;ition, I &s;hall tru&s;t to the judgment of every friend of France to ap|prove or condemn this publication.&mdash;O you, my coun|trymen, whom I love, and who ought to love me for flying my country for your &s;ake<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">As &s;oon as the Editor had determined to publi&s;h the&s;e papers, he thought it advi&s;eable to retire to Holland.&mdash;The Ba&s;tille has never been a friend to the liberty of the pre&s;s.</NOTE>, will you not at la&s;t think and act like Frenchmen of true &s;pirit?</P>
<P>&mdash;The editor has publi&s;hed the &s;everal papers without any arrangement, but merely as he drew them out of the box, leaving it to the &s;uperior &s;agacity of his readers to form their own opinions as they may natu|rally ari&s;e from reading them.</P>

<HEAD>INSTRUCTIONS FOR MYSELF<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It co&s;t the Editor great pains to decypher the&s;e private memorandums&mdash;they appeared by the M. S. to have been &s;ketched out at different times by M. De Sartine, &s;ometimes with a pen, and &s;ometimes with a pencil.</NOTE>.</HEAD>
<P>WHENEVER His Maje&s;ty talks to me about the di&s;tre&s;s of the people, the low &s;tate of the finances, or of &s;uch things, I mu&s;t expatiate on glory, the love of empire, Louis le Grand, &amp;c.</P>
<P>If his Maje&s;ty &s;hould inquire for the particulars of our lo&s;s at Pondicherry, I will immediately recount the arms, ammunition, and warlike &s;tores, &s;o gloriou&s;ly ta|ken at Senegal. It is but a &s;light tran&s;ition from A&s;ia to Africa, and his Maje&s;ty is no pedant in geography.</P>
<P>D'E&s;taing's &s;quadron is in &s;o bad a way, that it is now high time for me to di&s;cover that I always have thought he would not &s;ucceed&mdash;I have looked melan|choly for the two la&s;t levees; but this is not enough. I mu&s;t take a decided line&mdash;I am therefore determined, at all events, the very fir&s;t time the King mentions D'E&s;taing, to <HI>&s;hake my head;</HI> nay, I have my doubts whether it may not be eligible&mdash;even to <HI>&s;hrug up my &s;houlders.</HI></P>
<P>Though it is very right to prai&s;e &s;o young a King as ours, for his genero&s;ity and di&s;intere&s;ted love for Ame|rica, yet it's not politic to &s;ay too much of this. In an ab&s;olute monarchy, it is dangerous to talk &s;o warm|ly
<PB N="6" REF="5">of the love of liberty; be&s;ides it may appear a little incon&s;i&s;tent; for, tho' we are now &s;o kind to Ameri|ca, we can't quite forget how the Engli&s;h differed in opinion with us about Cor&s;ica; and if our court is &s;o liberal to Dr Franklyn, does not his Britannic Maje&s;ty &s;upport poor Paoli?</P>
<P>I begin to think it's high time we &s;hould furni&s;h his Maje&s;ty with a mi&s;tre&s;s in our intere&s;ts; for, though the Queen, who is quite our friend, governs him pretty well at pre&s;ent, it cannot be rea&s;onably &s;uppo&s;ed, that a wife can long retain her influence. I mu&s;t talk to <HI>Du Th&eacute;</HI> on this &s;ubject&mdash;&s;ome woman mu&s;t always go|vern France; and whether Madame Maintenon was a wife, or a mi&s;tre&s;s, &s;he equally refuted the Salic law.</P>
<P>It will be very prudent to hire a good quantity of poets, painters, &s;culptors, and engravers, to keep his Maje&s;ty in good humour with him&s;elf, and chace away all melancholy thoughts from Ver&s;ailles. On every occa&s;ion of bad news, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to give va|riety to adulation. Sometimes to pre&s;ent his Maje&s;ty with an ode or two, in which he &s;hall be ranked with the Jupiters, the Apollos, the Alexanders, &amp;c.&mdash;at o|ther times to &s;urpa&s;s, if po&s;&s;ible, the flattering pencil of Le Brun&mdash;now to repre&s;ent in allegory, his protection of America, under the form of a fountain, with thir|teen &s;pouts watering thirteen laurels&mdash;Invention mu&s;t be racked for new de&s;igns in medals; for example, his Maje&s;ty binding thirteen faggots&mdash;His Maje&s;ty a colo&s;|&s;us, one foot at Paris, the other at Philadelphia. The misfortune is, it will be almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible to invent no|velties; for, while Louis XIV. was at war with the Hollanders, he had almo&s;t as many medals in honour
<PB N="7" REF="6">of his love of liberty, as he &s;uffered defeats for actually combating again&s;t it. However, if medals can't be managed well, we may try what tape&s;try can do. Col|bert was a cunning Scot, and certainly founded the Gobelins, as a new re&s;ource for flattery. We mu&s;t improve on this &s;y&s;tem, and new hang the Louvre with wor&s;ted laurels over the thirteen American &s;tripes in|ter&s;per&s;ed with fleur de lys.</P>
<P>Neckar either has a little too much con&s;cience, or he deceives people very artfully; for he refu&s;es any &s;alary for his office; yet, if he has no douceurs, no bribes, no contracts, how very fal&s;e the old proverb is, <HI>point d' argent point de Sui&s;&s;e!</HI></P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAD the honour to receive your commands, con|veyed in the mo&s;t obliging manner, by your &s;ecre|tary. The connections which &s;ome years re&s;idence here has enabled me to form, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the introduc|tions you have &s;o judiciou&s;ly pointed out, may give me &s;ome few occa&s;ions of making di&s;coveries, not wholly unworthy your attention. But, I mu&s;t own, I fear the&s;e will be but few; were I employed in this kind of <HI>&s;ecret emba&s;&s;y,</HI> by almo&s;t any one but Mon&s;ieur de Sartine, I might, perhaps, magnify trifles, and repeat trite details, with an officiou&s;ne&s;s and my&s;tery &s;ufficient
<PB N="8" REF="7">to promote my own intere&s;t. But, when I write to you, what event can I communicate, which your wi&s;|dom will not have fore&s;een? What opinions can I &s;ugge&s;t, that can be new to your under&s;tanding? This difficulty would be great in any country: In England it has double force.&mdash;Alas! in the&s;e times, a &s;py's office here is almo&s;t a &s;inecure: A dozen news-papers in the morning, and as many fre&s;h ones every evening, rob us of all our bu&s;ine&s;s: A &s;ecret, even in private affairs, is a prodigy in London; but, as to public matters, it is the patriot's boa&s;t, that a free con&s;titu|tion abhors &s;ecrecy: And &s;o, indeed, it &s;eems; for, not only the minute&s;t accounts of the army, the navy, and the taxes, but the mini&s;ter's letters, official in|&s;tructions, and, in &s;hort, every paper, the di&s;clo&s;ure of which may &s;erve oppo&s;ition, and tend to prejudice the mini&s;ters, by a premature di&s;covery of their plans, are perpetually called for, and mu&s;t lie on the tables of Parliament; where, as &s;oon as they are once brought, their contents, one way or other, get into print; con&s;equently, a few days after they are pu|bli&s;hed, the French mini&s;ters are not only as much in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of them as the Engli&s;h, but &s;tudy them far more attentively, and to ten times more advantage, than <HI>they</HI> do who called for their di&s;clo&s;ure in Eng|land.&mdash;All this is bad encouragement to a &s;py at London. News-papers, pamphlets, parliamentary de|bates, remembrancers, and all the infinite variety of periodical libels, under the conduct of our good friend Mr Almon, leave but a &s;canty and beaten field of po|litics for private di&s;covery. To be of any real u&s;e, I mu&s;t limit my re&s;earches to the &s;ecret motives, and
<PB N="9" REF="8">concealed intere&s;ts of the contending factions. The Engli&s;h them&s;elves publi&s;h the text of politics&mdash;I mu&s;t write the comment. Engaged as we are m$a war, which the &s;peeches, writings, predictions, and menaces of the oppo&s;ition in England have led us to attempt, it will be of mo&s;t con&s;equence to penetrate their in|tentions, to trace their true de&s;igns, and, in &s;ho$t, to be a <HI>&s;py on their hearts;</HI> a &s;tudy to which a di&s;|banded Je&s;uit has, perhaps, the be&s;t key, by con&s;ul$ing his own. I am invited to dine with Lord Shelburne in a few days; after which, I &s;hall &s;eize the fir&s;t occa|&s;ion to tran&s;mit my next de&s;patches; happy to give every te&s;timony of my perfect re&s;pect and attachment to Mr de Sartine.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU &s;hou'd have heard from me before now, but, as I cou'd not &s;afely write by the po&s;t, I waited for this private conveyance; particularly as I wi&s;hed to acknowledge, in the mo&s;t &s;ecure manner, your goodne&s;s in allowing me to draw for 200 Luidores par avance&mdash;A few days after I wrote to you la&s;t, I dined with Lord Shelburne. Mon&s;r. &mdash; &s;poke of me &s;o favourably to his friend Dr Price, the celebrated calculator, that the Dr advi&s;ed his Lord&s;hip to invite me&mdash;It was on the 30th January, a kind of fe&s;tival to all true republicans&mdash;I went with Dr Price; and when we were announced, we found his Lord&s;hip in his li|brary, with the whole Shelburne party; that is to &s;ay,
<PB N="12" REF="11">with his two friends Col. Barr&eacute; and Coun&s;ellor Dun|ning.&mdash;The&s;e great &s;tate&s;men were rather oddly em|ployed&mdash;They were attending to Dr Prie&s;tley on a lec|ture of electricity, which I found however had &s;ome reference to politics. At fir&s;t indeed they only tried experiments of curio&s;ity&mdash;one of them was ridiculous enough&mdash;They put the Orator Dunning on a little &s;tool with gla&s;s legs. He is fat and &s;hort; and put me in mind of Dr La&s;t's examination in Foot's Devil on Two Sticks&mdash;I a&s;ked whether they put him there to harangue; when Lord Shelburne very ob&s;igingly di|rected me to put my finger to the orator's no&s;e, from which, to my great di&s;plea&s;ure, &s;parks &s;lew out; &s;o that I immediately &s;u&s;pected this machine was con|&s;tructed to light up his countenance: But they told me this was only a prologue before the operation, which now came on; for he de&s;cended from the &s;tool, and they put a wire round his neck to pa&s;s the electric fire through his throat; for this orator is hu&s;ky, and Dr Prie&s;tley flatters him&s;elf that the&s;e manoeuvres con|tinued regularly for a few years, may at la&s;t di&s;&s;olve the phlegm, and re&s;tore his voice&mdash;As &s;oon as the&s;e philo&s;ophical politics were over, Col. Barr&eacute; entered in|to conver&s;ation with me&mdash;A man of abilities, but very noi&s;y!&mdash;However, I was very happy to find he had a mo&s;t exten&s;ive acquaintance in France, and indeed in all quarters of the globe; though I own, when he told me he was particularly intimate with you, I was rather a|&s;toni&s;hed that you had never given me a hint of it<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Though I have not the &s;lighte&s;t acquaintance with the $$$ond, I'll not di&s;claim it&mdash;perhaps I may improve on the $word$</NOTE>.&mdash;
<PB N="13" REF="12">The Colonel has a fine voice for the eloquence of op|po&s;ition&mdash;a deep ba&s;e to expre&s;s the doubts and fears of a patriot, and the cadence of muttering thunder to threaten <HI>a mini&s;ter.</HI> With the&s;e two orators alone, Lord Shelburne &s;hares his councils and his hopes; and not injudiciou&s;ly; for the one has the reputation of being the be&s;t advocate <HI>in a bad cau&s;e,</HI> and the other is cer|tainly the be&s;t &s;tory-teller in Europe.&mdash;You &s;ee then, this party is a little expo&s;ed to divi&s;ion and jealou&s;y. Indeed they are tolerably &s;ecure of unanimity; at lea&s;t, of a greater degree of it than any other party&mdash;How|ever, a few &s;ubaltern friends might give them more effect; for, at pre&s;ent, they &s;eem like three admirals without any ve&s;&s;els under their conduct; but they are too proud to be united to any &s;et of men, mini&s;ters or oppo&s;ition.&mdash;His Lord&s;hip indeed is a kind of mini&s;ter by <HI>anticipation,</HI> and his time at pre&s;ent is a rehear&s;al of what he hopes it will actually be at la&s;t; he practi|&s;es the <HI>etiquette</HI> of greatne&s;s in his own hou&s;e; he treats his private company as they were at his pu|blic levee; he addre&s;&s;es them <HI>en routine;</HI> he proportions his &s;miles, and gives a limited quantity of compliments &s;uitable to their different ranks; affecting to adapt him&s;elf and accommodate his conver&s;ation to the level of his audience.</P>
<P>As far as I can judge, he is very fond of pa&s;&s;ing for the Maecenas of England; he would be thought to encourage all the fine arts; and, if a new kind of mou&s;e-trap was invented, he would be mortified not to be thought the patron of &s;o u&s;eful an arti&s;t; his conver&s;ation, which turns mo&s;tly on politics, is a med|ley of the &s;entiments and &s;ayings of his two friends, and
<PB N="14" REF="13">his two philo&s;ophers; &s;o that he &s;eems a talking Ency|clopoedie, where the different &s;ubjects of the compo&s;ition are &s;upplied by the proper profe&s;&s;ors; the <HI>art militaire,</HI> and <HI>knowledge of the world,</HI> by Col. Barr&eacute; the tricks and &s;ubtile di&s;tinctions of law by Mr Dunning; philo&s;o|phy and &s;ceptici&s;m by Dr Prie&s;tley; and political para|doxes by my friend Dr Price.&mdash;All this cannot fail of making out &s;omething &s;triking, though not original; we admire the picture, though the trees are done by one, the cattle by another, and the figures by a third, and &s;o on; for the de&s;ign at lea&s;t is great, and the combi|nation of &s;uch &s;cattered beauties is curious and &s;plen|did&mdash;My Lord him&s;elf &s;tudies finances mo&s;t; he has all kinds of li&s;ts of all kinds of things; and he had the goodne&s;s to tell me, in confidence, that he has di&s;co|vered &s;o many thou&s;and fre&s;h &s;ubjects for taxes, that he could quite charm the nation with new impo&s;ts, if he was but once mini&s;ter. So attentive is he to the&s;e calculations, that he thinks of them at all times and places; and he a&s;&s;ured the Hou&s;e of Lords, in a de|bate about America, that he rode out every day in Hyde-park to a&s;certain more preci&s;ely the proportion|able number of hor&s;es in England, by calculating tho&s;e in Middle&s;ex, in order to a general tax on &s;addles and bridles.&mdash;How far &s;uch a party as this can &s;erve the French mini&s;ters, by attacking tho&s;e of England, I leave it to your &s;uperior &s;agacity to determine: It is to me a much le&s;s doubtful point, how far they would &s;erve you, if they were mini&s;ters them&s;elves.&mdash;I hope &s;oon to give you &s;ome &s;ketch of the <HI>Rockingham Party;</HI> in the mean time, I remain, with the utmo&s;t re&s;pect, your's, &amp;c.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>MY DEAR FRIEND,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM but ju&s;t returned from a tedious levee of the Queen's, where your American Amba&s;&s;adors had their fir&s;t audience&mdash;a &s;incere head-ach might plead my excu&s;e for not fulfilling my promi&s;e of writing&mdash;But I know you are anxious to hear how their Excel|lencies are liked, or rather <HI>tolerated</HI>&mdash;Con&s;idering all, then, pretty well!&mdash;But, indeed, you mu&s;t thank the Counte&s;s <HI>Jule de Polignac</HI> and me for it&mdash;for, it was no very ea&s;y matter to per&s;uade her Maje&s;ty to <HI>endure</HI> them.

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>EVERY day I am more convinced how hard a ta&s;k it is to di&s;cover valuable &s;ecrets. You &s;eemed aware of this, when you pointed out people whom you thought could a&s;&s;i&s;t me in my emba&s;&s;y. At the head of this li&s;t was Mon&s;. <HI>Le Te&s;&s;ier.</HI> I had my fir&s;t audience of him at his hotel in Market-lane; and this was the re&s;ult. He a&s;&s;ured me he &s;till loved his country, but, at pre&s;ent, this love mu&s;t be a little &s;u|&s;pended, for he was now director of the opera, and had &s;olemnly bound him&s;elf to his patrons, never to &s;peak or write about politics; be&s;ides all the lei&s;ure
<PB N="17" REF="16">time he had was devoted to learning the rudiments of the Engli&s;h language in the morning, in order to criti|ci&s;e the be&s;t and mo&s;t refined works in it in the evening.&mdash;I told him, though this might check out conferring in public, yet we might have nightly conferences. 'Ah! Mon&s;. he cried, recollect <HI>Baumarchais</HI> and <HI>De|on!</HI> If you and I were to meet in this way, it would renew the idea of a <HI>&s;py wedding,</HI> and one of us mu&s;t forfeit the dignity of being thought of the male gender.' &mdash;Still he a&s;&s;ured me, he loved his country and Mon&s;. <HI>De Sartine.</HI> And, at la&s;t, he hit on a method, without breaking his promi&s;e to his patrons, to communicate &s;ecrets quite in a new way, more curious than hints in hieroglyphics, or libels in lemon juice&mdash;And how is this? you will &s;ay. Why, in &s;hort, merely by the fa&s;hion of dre&s;&s;ing his hair&mdash;Of dre&s;&s;ing his hair!&mdash;Yes, it is &s;o; for, having fixed on our plan of &s;ignals, I can now, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of a good gla&s;s, even a|cro&s;s the opera-hou&s;e, interpret his thoughts on politics by the <HI>po&s;ition</HI> and <HI>number</HI> of his curls&mdash;For example&mdash;as &s;tocks are likely to fall or ri&s;e, <HI>they,</HI> too, will mount or de&s;cend above or below his ear, which hence will become a kind of barometer, or graduated &s;cale for all the variations of public gambling,&mdash;&s;o, too, I &s;hall &s;ee by their <HI>extention</HI> or <HI>contraction,</HI> whether mini&s;ters will be <HI>rigid</HI> or <HI>relaxed</HI> towards America; and, by aug|menting or dimini&s;hing their number, he can convey to me his opinions whether factions will become more or le&s;s numerous, which is the material point during the &s;ittings of parliament.&mdash;I wi&s;hed, indeed, that he would improve on this la&s;t idea, and &s;et apart the dif|ferent &s;ides of his head to expre&s;s his remarks on the oppo&s;ite parties in politics; the right, for the mini&s;try,
<PB N="18" REF="17">the left, for oppo&s;ition; one &s;et of buckles for the whigs, and the oppo&s;ite for the tories; and &s;o compare the Ayes and the Noes by the different proportion of buckles on the oppo&s;ite ears&mdash;But this, he &s;aid, was exacting too much&mdash;and, even, if Mrs Hubbard could be reconciled to &s;uch a paradox in hair-dre&s;&s;ing, the very novelty might alarm &s;u&s;picion, and lead to detec|tion&mdash;However, he will be very correct in what he does communicate, and, for that rea&s;on, he now calls his valet de chambre his &s;ecretary, as he is to copy out the ideas of his head on his hair.&mdash;Thus, Sir, you &s;ee how difficult it is to profit even by our friends; and on what delicate di&s;tinctions my &s;ources of intelligence mu&s;t depend: Yet I &s;hall avail my&s;elf as much as I can of them, in order to obey your commands.</P>

<P>THE Reader may po&s;&s;ibly expect the letter on the Rockingham party, which the &s;py promi&s;ed in one of his former$d &s;patches; but the Editor has found it impo&s;&s;ible to publi&s;h it. It is true, there was one in the box upon this &s;ubject, but very much blotted and era&s;ed: As far as it could be made out, it appeared very &s;evere on this Rockingham party, as they are called.&mdash;Po&s;&s;ibly Sartine might have thought that &s;uch profe&s;&s;ed enemies of the Engli&s;h, were of cour&s;e, the be&s;t friends of the Engli&s;h mini&s;try, and accordingly effaced this &s;atire again&s;t his own intere&s;t; or, perhaps, politene&s;s conquered party; and, though the ludicrous account of the Shelburnites did not much offend him, he entirely di&s;approved of &s;erious per&s;onalities, upon any &s;ubject or occa&s;ion.&mdash;However it was, he had blot|ted out &s;ome words, and left others remaining&mdash;for example, there &s;eemed to have been (but it was &s;carce|ly intelligible) a good deal at fir&s;t about ari&s;tocracy, and again&s;t the ob&s;olete preten&s;ions of &s;ome noblemen, who think they are perfectly qualified for Mini&s;ters in the&s;e times, becau&s;e their relations were plain, hone&s;t people la&s;t century.&mdash;This was half rubb'd out, but near it, <HI>hereditary virtue</HI> was very legible. There was a que&s;tion, why the de&s;cendants of Dutch families,
<PB N="31" REF="30">&s;hould pretend to lead his pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty, merely be|cau&s;e their ance&s;tors were King William's followers; or why George the Third &s;hould prefer two or three Dukes now a days, becau&s;e Charles the Second was fond of their great grand-mothers.&mdash;This too had the pen drawn acro&s;s it; and over it, Sartine had written in capital letters&mdash;STAUNCH, OLD WHIGS.</P>
<P>Clo&s;e to the names of Grenville and Burke, I could ju&s;t make out <HI>&s;tamp act</HI> and <HI>declaratory law,</HI> and a word or two about incon&s;i&s;tency and party; but the&s;e were followed by a long &s;tring of compliments on wi&s;dom and eloquence. There &s;eemed to be a kind of allegory about this party; it was called an ho&s;pital for invalid Admirals and Generals; a parliamentary Chel&s;ea for wounded honour, and decayed reputation: Sartine had blotted this too, by way of keeping up a light and &s;hade, in this mutilated manu&s;cript, for the character which followed, were youthful indi&s;cretion, and <HI>Newmarket</HI> were the only words era&s;ed in whole pages of panegyric.</P>
<P>By way of po&s;t&s;cript, the &s;py had given a li&s;t of tho&s;e who were always to be admitted to Lord Rocking|ham's levee; this it &s;eems his wife had obtained by vi|&s;iting Lady Rockingham's femme de chambre, who had got a copy from the Marquis's porter; it was torn, but, on the fragments, I &s;aw Mr Burke, Mr Nollikins, Mr Charles Turner, the Duke of Grafton, Jack Lee, Jack Ryder, Sir George Howard, and, at the corner, <HI>Captain</HI> Wal&s;ingham, with a quaere as to the <HI>Colonel.</HI></P>

<HEAD>Her <HI>MAJESTY</HI>'S An&s;wer to My Letters, inclo&s;ing <HI>MAU|REPAS</HI>' and <HI>NECKAR</HI>'S.</HEAD>
<LETTER>
<P>S&mdash;</P>
<P>I HAVE &s;tudied very attentively the letter you &s;ent me.&mdash;That Maurepas and Neckar &s;hould hold &s;uch language, does not in the lea&s;t &s;urpri&s;e me, but that you &s;hould &s;een affected by their apprehen&s;ions, is a point I cannot account for.&mdash;The King, you &s;ay, appears to be out of &s;pirits with the war.&mdash;I grant it; and am rather plea&s;ed he is &s;o; for it will incline him &s;till le&s;s to interfere in the management of it. Had the commencement of it been marked with any very encouraging circum&s;tances, it is probable, he might have become more alert and inqui&s;itive in the bu&s;ine&s;s, than would have &s;uited either my ambition or your intere&s;t. No, Sartine! let us once e&s;tabli&s;h our party, by whatever means, in the management of this war, and doubt not but we &s;hall &s;oon have victories and triumphs to compen&s;ate for a little pre&s;ent di&s;grace.&mdash;A&s;k Vergennes whether he does not think as I do on this &s;ubject.&mdash;Or, &s;hould we even be forced to aban|don our &s;y&s;tem, we may at all times negotiate with equal advantage: Nay, the <HI>Duke de Nivernois</HI> a&s;&s;erts,
<PB N="46" REF="45">(and, I think, he is ju&s;tified in it), that the more un|&s;ucce&s;sful the war is on our part, the more &s;ecure we &s;hall be of an advantageous peace.&mdash;The Engli&s;h, from a fooli&s;h affectation of magnanimity, acquire humility from triumphs; &s;o that the more victories they gain, the fewer conce&s;&s;ions they require.&mdash;They will never beat us out of our ability to conquer them in treaties.</P>
<P>So far for your &s;tate&s;men's timid and de&s;ponding arguments.&mdash;But to the letter, which you inclo&s;e me from the officious Bi&s;hop of &mdash; I &s;carcely think a reply can be nece&s;&s;ary. He begins with expre&s;&s;ions of the highe&s;t admiration at the &s;pirit and genius which he affects to di&s;cover in me, and which he pro|nounces to be &s;o extraordinary from my youth and &s;ex.&mdash;He in&s;tances, in a very flattering &s;tyle, the glo|rious effects of female enterpri&s;e and ability, from A&s;&s;yrian Semiramis to Ru&s;&s;ian Catharine; and then deliberately enters upon a formal panegyric on the &s;u|perior virtue and beauty of retired dignity and do|me&s;tic felicity: A &s;ituation, which, with more zeal than argument, he a&s;&s;erts, will yield the true&s;t fame to a wedded Prince&s;s: And, with a provoking confi|dence, re&s;ts his proofs on the &s;ingle in&s;tance of Char|lotte of England.</P>
<P>Tell the good Bi&s;hop I have no objection to his &s;tyle, nor to his introduction: But I had rather have him for my hi&s;torian than my coun&s;ellor. A&s;&s;ure him, however, that I very thankfully accept all his compliments; and reject nothing but his doctrine.</P>
<P>Were I inclined to debate the point with him, as a matter of argument only, inexperienced as I am, I &s;hould not doubt but that the better rea&s;ons would
<PB N="47" REF="46">appear on my &s;ide. It is &s;carcely po&s;&s;ible for a wo|man, whom Fate has de&s;tined to partake a throne, to be capable, much le&s;s de&s;irous, of deriving her hap|pine&s;s from the tranquil duties, and frivolous enjoy|ments, which &s;uit the &s;phere, and con&s;titute the habits of tho&s;e in a le&s;s exalted &s;tate. From her infancy, her de&s;ires and expectations are moulded on a diffe|rent bia&s;s&mdash;her cradle is watched with more jealou&s;y than affection, and her maturer age is looked forward to, not with the fond anticipation of parental love, but with the intere&s;ted impatience of political &s;peculation.&mdash;The cultivation of her mind is on principles which oppo&s;e the growth of every tender plant which the hand of Nature has placed there&mdash;the &s;eedlings of gentle affection and &s;ympathetic fondne&s;s, are torn out as weeds. She mu&s;t accu&s;tom her&s;elf to be without choice in the mo&s;t important intere&s;ts of life.&mdash;She mu&s;t not think of love&mdash;nor can imagine the being loved.&mdash;She has no inducements to form attachments of friend|&s;hip in a country &s;he will be compelled to leave; nor can her filial affection be great, when &s;he con&s;iders that her <HI>happine&s;s</HI> is but a &s;econdary object to her pa|rents. At length the &s;tate requires its &s;acrifice of her, and &s;he is wedded without choice.&mdash;From that mo|ment, ob&s;erve the curious ju&s;tice that is exacted from her: <Q>You are now to attach your mind to dome&s;tic &startq;delights&mdash;You are now to cultivate affection and &s;ocial love&mdash;Avoid all interference in matters of &s;tate. Private virtues and accompli&s;hments are a Queen's be&s;t ornaments; nothing beyond is amiable; no|thing &endq;engaging.</Q>&mdash;In this manner, I remember, did my great aunt &mdash; harangue me on my
<PB N="48" REF="47">leaving Vienna; and the good Bi&s;hop appears to be a teacher of the &s;ame per&s;ua&s;ion. But, is there &s;en&s;e or rea&s;on in &s;uppo&s;ing that the con&s;titution of the mind can at once be &s;o entirely changed? Can it in&s;tantly repo&s;&s;e&s;s it&s;elf of tho&s;e feelings and inclina|tions which every attempt had been made to era|dicate?&mdash;When in earlie&s;t &s;pring you have killed the root, will you call for the luxuriance of a &s;ummer's &s;hade? In all other &s;ituations of life, the force of ha|bit and education is admitted.&mdash;No per&s;on in Paris marrying a girl, who, from her infancy, has been bred at St Cyr, expects to find at once the manners and principles of a fini&s;hed <HI>precieu&s;e;</HI> as rea&s;onably might the beau at Pekin require, that the maid, who, to at|tain one &s;pecies of beauty, has been cramped and crip|pled from her cradle, &s;hould dance at her marriage, with the activity of a Chine&s;e <HI>Heinel</HI>&mdash;From tho&s;e only who are born to royalty, are &s;uch incon&s;i&s;tencies re|quired&mdash;We are readily &s;uffered to con&s;ider our&s;elves as creatures of a political relation and importance, till it is the intere&s;t of the &s;tate to portion us into exile&mdash;But is the <HI>Queen</HI> to be &s;till more in&s;ignificant than the <HI>Prince&s;s?</HI> Is the <HI>policy</HI> of her marriage the only &s;tate-bu&s;ine&s;s &s;he is capable of under&s;tanding? Was the <HI>ne|gotiation</HI> for her affection the la&s;t &s;he is to be con&s;ulted in? Is &s;he to be related to the empire on who&s;e throne &s;he &s;its, only by the alliance &s;he has given it? And, in &s;hort, to be made u&s;e of in the grand political engine, as the <HI>pivot</HI> on which nations are united and brought into co-operation; yet, in the working of it, to be de|nied the credit of being a part of the machine? I wi&s;h tho&s;e, who are &s;o de&s;irous of &s;eeing &s;uch a prodigy of
<PB N="49" REF="48">dome&s;tic maje&s;ty, would al&s;o draw out the plan on which &s;o amiable a &s;cheme is to be carried into execu|tion&mdash;I confe&s;s my&s;elf, that I have no very accurate ideas of a Paris Penelope&mdash;Perhaps, to give the true dignity to &s;uch a &s;tate, they would have the whole bu|&s;ine&s;s of dome&s;tic felicity and conjugal tenderne&s;s, be|tween a royal pair, conducted with the &s;ame ceremony with which the alliance commenced. And, really, it would be an inju&s;tice, that they, who&s;e obedient affec|tions were won by proxy and emba&s;&s;ies, &s;hould be put to the fatigue of &s;upporting the tender connection without &s;imilar interferences. On this plan, a due dig|nity might &s;till be pre&s;erved&mdash;the form of demanding an <HI>audience</HI> &s;hould precede each familiar <HI>vi&s;it;</HI> and no <HI>private conference</HI> &s;hould ever degenerate into a <HI>tet&eacute; a tet&eacute;&mdash;Billet-deux emba&s;&s;ies</HI> might be frequent, through which the &s;oft intercour&s;e of &s;ighs and compliments might be carried on with a &s;uitable decorum&mdash;<HI>Exclu&s;ive treaties,</HI> with regard to &s;miles and the <HI>doux yeux,</HI> would be adju&s;ted by a <HI>pacte de famille;</HI> and, though no ap|pearance of favouriti&s;m &s;hould exi&s;t, yet the &s;overeign might be permitted to <HI>ki&s;s hands on being pre&s;ented</HI>&mdash;with an heir&mdash;It would be unpolite to require the con|&s;tancy of either to be <HI>guarant&eacute;ed</HI>&mdash;However, on the ab&s;ence of the Monarch, he might appoint a re&s;ident, with limited powers, or to act only as <HI>charg&eacute; des affairs.</HI></P>
<P>Excu&s;e my writing with &s;uch levity; but there is a ridicule in the inju&s;tice of all arguments again&s;t the privileges of our &s;ex, of what ever rank, which makes it impo&s;&s;ible to an&s;wer them with &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s.</P>
<PB N="50" REF="49">
<P>&mdash;In &s;hort, I have con&s;idered what pur&s;uits are be&s;t calculated to give &s;atisfaction to my own mind.&mdash;I feel no real delight in the elegant di&s;&s;ipations of a court, though I affect to lead them. The admiration I receive is too much cha&s;ti&s;ed by re&s;pect to &s;ituation, to flatter mere female vanity; the gratifying which is the only true inducement to be graceful or amiable.&mdash;To deter me from the pur&s;uit of politics, or a de&s;ire of governing, let &s;uch dull morali&s;ts as the Bi|&s;hop quote the Salic law, and all the common place in|ferences which ungallant policy has drawn from it.&mdash;On a true female &s;pirit it mu&s;t act rather as an induce|ment.&mdash;It would be impious in any of us to pre|tend that the <HI>Original Interdiction</HI> would have opera|ted otherwi&s;e on our minds than it did on our fir&s;t parents: And had Eve partaken of a throne in a coun|try like France, the mere provocation of the <HI>Salic Law</HI> would have prevented her knowing re&s;t till &s;he had acquired a &s;hare in the government.&mdash;</P>
