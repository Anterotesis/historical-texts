<HEAD>THE
EXPEDITION
OF
HUMPHRY CLINKER.</HEAD>
<LETTER>
<OPENER>To Dr. LEWIS.</OPENER>
<P>I SHOULD be very ungrateful, dear
Lewis, if I did not find my&s;elf di&s;|po&s;ed
to think and &s;peak favourably of
this people, among whom I have met with
more kindne&s;s, ho&s;pitality, and rational
entertainment, in a few weeks, than ever
I received in any other country during
the whole cour&s;e of my life.&mdash;Perhaps,
<PB N="2" REF="4">
the gratitude excited by the&s;e benefits
may interfere with the impartiality of my
remarks; for a man is as apt to be pre|po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed
by particular favours as to be
prejudiced by private motives of di&s;gu&s;t.
If I am partial, there is, at lea&s;t, &s;ome me|rit
in my conver&s;ion from illiberal preju|dices
which had grown up with my con|&s;titution.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t impre&s;&s;ions which an Engli&s;h|man
receives in this country, will not
contribute to the removal of his preju|dices;
becau&s;e he refers every thing he
&s;ees to a compari&s;on with the &s;ame articles
in his own country; and this compari&s;on
is unfavourable to Scotland in all its ex|teriors,
&s;uch as the face of the country in
re&s;pect to cultivation, the appearance of
the bulk of the people, and the language
of conver&s;ation in general.&mdash;I am not &s;o
far convinced by Mr. Li&s;mahago's argu|ments,
but that I think the Scots would
do well, for their own &s;akes, to adopt the
Engli&s;h idioms and pronunciation; tho&s;e
of them e&s;pecially, who are re&s;olved to
pu&s;h their fortunes in South-Britain.&mdash;
I know, by experience, how ea&s;ily an
Engli&s;hman is influenced by the ear, and
how apt he is to laugh, when he hears his
own language &s;poken with a foreign or
<PB N="3" REF="5">
provincial accent.&mdash;I have known a mem|ber
of the hou&s;e of commons &s;peak with
great energy and preci&s;ion, without being
able to engage attention, becau&s;e his ob|&s;ervations
were made in the Scotch dia|lect,
which (no offence to lieutenant Li&s;|mahago)
certainly gives a clowni&s;h air
even to &s;entiments of the greate&s;t dignity
and decorum.&mdash;I have declared my opi|nion
on this head to &s;ome of the mo&s;t
&s;en&s;ible men of this country, ob&s;erving,
at the &s;ame time, that if they would em|ploy
a few natives of England to teach the
pronunciation of our vernacular tongue,
in twenty years there would be no diffe|rence,
in point of dialect, between the
youth of Edinburgh and of London.</P>
<P>The civil regulations of this kingdom
and metropolis are taken from very dif|ferent
models from tho&s;e of England, ex|cept
in a few particular e&s;tabli&s;hments,
the nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equences of the union.
&mdash;Their college of ju&s;tice is a bench of
great dignity, filled with judges of cha|racter
and ability.&mdash;I have heard &s;ome
cau&s;es tried before this venerable tribu|nal;
and was very much plea&s;ed with the
pleadings of their advocates, who are by
no means deficient either in argument or
elocution. The Scotti&s;h legi&s;lation is
<PB N="4" REF="6">
founded, in a great mea&s;ure, on the civil
law; con&s;equently, their proceedings vary
from tho&s;e of the Engli&s;h tribunals; but,
I think, they have the advantage of us
in their method of examining witne&s;&s;es
apart, and in the con&s;titution of their
jury, by which they certainly avoid the
evil which I mentioned in my la&s;t from
Li&s;mahago's ob&s;ervation.</P>
<P>The univer&s;ity of Edinburgh is &s;up|plied
with excellent profe&s;&s;ors in all the
&s;ciences; and the medical &s;chool, in par|ticular,
is famous all over Europe.&mdash;The
&s;tudents of this art have the be&s;t opportu|nity
of learning it to perfection, in all its
branches, as there are different cour&s;es
for the <HI>theory of medicine,</HI> and the <HI>practice
of medicine;</HI> for <HI>anatomy, chemi&s;try, botany,</HI>
and the <HI>materia medica,</HI> over and above
tho&s;e of <HI>mathematics</HI> and <HI>experimental phi|lo&s;ophy;</HI>
and all the&s;e are given by men of
di&s;tingui&s;hed talents. What renders this
part of education &s;till more complete, is
the advantage of attending the infirmary,
which is the be&s;t in&s;tituted charitable
foundation that I ever knew. Now we
are talking of charities, here are &s;everal
ho&s;pitals, exceedingly well endowed, and
maintained under admirable regulations;
and the&s;e are not only u&s;eful, but orna|mental
<PB N="5" REF="7">
to the city. Among the&s;e, I &s;hall
only mention the general work-hou&s;e, in
which all the poor, not otherwi&s;e provided
for, are employed, according to their dif|ferent
abilities, with &s;uch judgment and
effect, that they nearly maintain them|&s;elves
by their labour, and there is not a
beggar to be &s;een within the precincts of
this metropolis. It was Gla&s;gow that &s;et
the example of this e&s;tabli&s;hment, about
thirty years ago.&mdash;Even the kirk of Scot|land,
&s;o long reproached with fanataci&s;m
and canting, abounds at pre&s;ent with mi|ni&s;ters
celebrated for their learning, and
re&s;pectable for their moderation.&mdash;I have
heard their &s;ermons with equal a&s;toni&s;h|ment
and plea&s;ure.&mdash;The good people of
Edinburgh no longer think dirt and cob|webs
e&s;&s;ential to the hou&s;e of God.&mdash;Some
of their churches have admitted &s;uch or|naments
as would have excited &s;edition,
even in England, a little more than a
century ago; and p&s;almody is here prac|ti&s;ed
and taught by a profe&s;&s;or from the
cathedral of Durham:&mdash;I &s;hould not be
&s;urpri&s;ed, in a few years, to hear it ac|companied
with an organ.</P>
<P>Edinburgh is a hot-bed of genius.&mdash;
I have had the good fortune to be made
acquainted with many authors of the fir&s;t
<PB N="6" REF="8">
di&s;tinction; &s;uch as the two Humes, Ro|bert&s;on,
Smith, Wallace, Blair, Fergu&s;on,
Wilkie, &amp;c. and I have found them all
as agreeable in conver&s;ation as they are
in&s;tructive and entertaining in their writ|ings.
The&s;e acquaintances I owe to the
friend&s;hip of Dr. Carlyle, who wants
nothing but inclination to figure with the
re&s;t upon paper. The magi&s;tracy of
Edinburgh is changed every year by elec|tion,
and &s;eems to be very well adapted
both for &s;tate and authority.&mdash;The <HI>lord
provo&s;t</HI> is equal in dignity to the <HI>lord mayor
of London;</HI> and the <HI>four bailies</HI> are equiva|lent
to the rank of aldermen.&mdash;There is
a <HI>dean of guild,</HI> who takes cognizance of
mercantile affairs; a trea&s;urer; a town|clerk;
and the council is compo&s;ed of
deacons, one of whom is returned every
year, in rotation, as repre&s;entative of every
company of artificers or handicraft&s;men.
Though this city, from the nature of its
&s;ituation, can never be made either very
convenient or very cleanly, it has, never|thele&s;s,
an air of magnificence that com|mands
re&s;pect.&mdash;The ca&s;tle is an in&s;tance
of the &s;ublime in &s;cite and architecture.&mdash;
Its fortifications are kept in good order,
and there is always in it a garri&s;on of re|gular
&s;oldiers, which is relieved every
<PB N="7" REF="9">
year; but it is incapable of &s;u&s;taining a
&s;iege carried on according to the modern
operations of war.&mdash;The ca&s;tle hill,
which extends from the outward gate to
the upper end of the high-&s;treet, is u&s;ed
as a public walk for the citizens, and
commands a pro&s;pect, equally exten&s;ive
and delightful, over the county of Fife,
on the other &s;ide of the Frith, and all
along the &s;ea-coa&s;t, which is covered
with a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of towns that would &s;eem
to indicate a con&s;iderable &s;hare of com|merce;
but, if the truth mu&s;t be told,
the&s;e towns have been falling to decay
ever &s;ince the union, by which the Scots
were in a great mea&s;ure deprived of their
trade with France.&mdash;The palace of Holy|rood-hou&s;e
is a jewel in architecture,
thru&s;t into a hollow where it cannot be
&s;een; a &s;ituation which was certainly not
cho&s;en by the ingenious architect, who
mu&s;t have been confined to the &s;cite of
the old palace, which was a convent.
Edinburgh is con&s;iderably extended on
the &s;outh &s;ide, where there are divers
little elegant &s;quares built in the Engli&s;h
manner; and the citizens have planned
&s;ome improvements on the north, which,
when put in execution, will add greatly
<PB N="8" REF="10">
to the beauty and convenience of this ca|pital.</P>
<P>The &s;ea-port is Leith, a flouri&s;hing
town, about a mile from the city, in the
harbour of which I have &s;een above one
hundred &s;hips lying all together. You
mu&s;t know, I had the curio&s;ity to cro&s;s
the Frith in a pa&s;&s;age-boat, and &s;tayed
two days in Fife, which is remarkably
fruitful in corn, and exhibits a &s;urpri&s;ing
number of fine &s;eats, elegantly built, and
magnificently furni&s;hed. There is an in|credible
number of noble hou&s;es in every
part of Scotland that I have &s;een.&mdash;Dal|keith,
Pinkie, Ye&s;ter, and lord Hopton's,
all of them within four or five miles of
Edinburgh, are princely palaces, in every
one of which a &s;overeign might re&s;ide at
his ea&s;e.&mdash;I &s;uppo&s;e the Scots affect the&s;e
monuments of grandeur.&mdash;If I may be
allowed to mingle cen&s;ure with my re|marks
upon a people I revere, I mu&s;t ob|&s;erve,
that their weak &s;ide &s;eems to be va|nity.&mdash;I
am afraid that even their ho&s;pi|tality
is not quite free of o&s;tentation.&mdash;
I think I have di&s;covered among them
uncommon pains taken to di&s;play their
fine linen, of which, indeed, they have
great plenty, their furniture, plate, hou&s;e-|keeping,
<PB N="9" REF="11">
and variety of wines, in which
article, it mu&s;t be owned, they are pro|fu&s;e,
if not prodigal.&mdash;A burgher of
Edinburgh, not content to vie with a ci|tizen
of London, who has ten times his
fortune, mu&s;t excel him in the expence
as well as elegance of his entertainments.</P>
<P>Though the villas of the Scotch nobi|lity
and gentry have generally an air of
grandeur and &s;tate, I think their gardens
and parks are not comparable to tho&s;e
of England; a circum&s;tance the more
remarkable, as I was told by the inge|nious
Mr. Philip Miller of Chel&s;ea, that
almo&s;t all the gardeners of South-Britain
were natives of Scotland. The verdure
of this country is not equal to that of
England.&mdash;The plea&s;ure-grounds are, in
my opinion, not &s;o well laid out accord|ing
to the <HI>genius loci;</HI> nor are the lawns,
and walks, and hedges kept in &s;uch de|licate
order.&mdash;The trees are planted in
prudi&s;h rows, which have not &s;uch an
agreeable natural effect, as when they
are thrown into irregular groupes, with
intervening glades; and the firs, which
they generally rai&s;e around their hou&s;es,
look dull and funereal in the &s;ummer
&s;ea&s;on.&mdash;I mu&s;t confe&s;s, indeed, that
they yield &s;erviceable timber, and good
<PB N="10" REF="12">
&s;helter again&s;t the northern bla&s;ts; that
they grow and thrive in the mo&s;t barren
&s;oil, and continually per&s;pire a fine bal|&s;am
of turpentine, which mu&s;t render the
air very &s;alutary and &s;anative to lungs of
a tender texture.</P>
<P>Tabby and I have been both frighten|ed
in our return by &s;ea from the coa&s;t
of Fife.&mdash;She was afraid of drowning,
and I of catching cold, in con&s;equence
of being drenched with &s;ea-water; but
my fears, as well as her's, have been hap|pily
di&s;appointed.&mdash;She is now in per|fect
health; I wi&s;h I could &s;ay the &s;ame
of Liddy.&mdash;Something uncommon is
the matter with that poor child; her
colour fades, her appetite fails, and her
&s;pirits flag.&mdash;She is become moping
and melancholy, and is often found in
tears.&mdash;Her brother &s;u&s;pects internal
unea&s;ine&s;s on account of Wil&s;on, and de|nounces
vegeance again&s;t that adventurer.
&mdash;She was, it &s;eems, &s;trongly affected
at the ball by the &s;udden appearance of
one Mr. Gordon, who &s;trongly re&s;embles
the &s;aid Wil&s;on; but I am rather &s;u&s;pi|cious
that &s;he caught cold by being over|heated
with dancing.&mdash;I have con&s;ulted
Dr. Gregory, an eminent phy&s;ician of
an amiable character, who advi&s;es the
<PB N="11" REF="13">
land air, and the u&s;e of goat-milk whey,
which, &s;urely, cannot have a bad effect
upon a patient who was born and bred
among the mountains of Wales.&mdash;The
doctor's opinion is the more agreeable, as
we &s;hall find tho&s;e remedies in the very
place which I propo&s;ed as the utmo&s;t ex|tent
of our expedition&mdash;I mean the bor|ders
of Argyle.</P>
<P>Mr. Smollett, one of the judges of the
commi&s;&s;ary court, which is now &s;itting,
has very kindly in&s;i&s;ted upon our lodging
at his country-hou&s;e, on the banks of
Lough-Lomond, about fourteen miles be|yond
Gla&s;gow. For this la&s;t city we
&s;hall &s;et out in two days, and take Stir|ling
in our way, well provided with re|commendations
from our friends at Edin|burgh,
whom, I prote&s;t, I &s;hall leave with
much regret. I am &s;o far from thinking
it any hard&s;hip to live in this country,
that, if I was obliged to lead a town life,
Edinburgh would certainly be the head|quarters

<LETTER>
<PB N="12" REF="14">
<OPENER>To Sir WATKIN PHILLIPS, Bar^t. of
Je&s;us college, Oxon.
DEAR KNIGHT,</OPENER>
<P>I AM now little &s;hort of the <HI>Ultima
Thule,</HI> if this appellation properly belongs
to the Orkneys or Hebrides. The&s;e la&s;t
are now lying before me, to the amount
of &s;ome hundreds, &s;cattered up and down
the Deucalidonian &s;ea, affording the mo&s;t
picture&s;que and romantic pro&s;pect I ever
beheld&mdash;I write this letter in a gentle|man's
hou&s;e, near the town of Inverary,
which may be deemed the capital of the
We&s;t Highlands, famous for nothing &s;o
much as for the &s;tately ca&s;tle begun, and
actually covered in by the late duke of
Argyle, at a prodigious expence&mdash;Whe|ther
it will ever be completely fini&s;hed is
a que&s;tion&mdash;</P>
<P>But, to take things in order.&mdash;We
left Edinburgh ten days ago; and the
further North we proceed, we find Mrs.
Tabitha the le&s;s manageable; &s;o that her
<PB N="13" REF="15">
inclinations are not of the nature of the
load&s;tone; they point not towards the pole.
What made her leave Edinburgh with re|luctance
at la&s;t, if we may believe her
own a&s;&s;ertions, was a di&s;pute which &s;he
left unfini&s;hed with Mr. Moffat, touch|ing
the eternity of hell torments. That
gentleman, as he advanced in years, be|gan
to be &s;ceptical on this head, till, at
length, he declared open war again&s;t the
common acceptation of the word <HI>eternal.</HI>
He is now per&s;uaded, that <HI>eternal</HI> &s;igni|fies
no more than an indefinite number of
years; and that the mo&s;t enormous &s;inner
may be quit for <HI>nine millions, nine hundred
thou&s;and, nine hundred and ninety-nine years
of hell-fire;</HI> which term or period, as he
very well ob&s;erves, forms but an incon|&s;iderable
drop, as it were, in the ocean of
eternity&mdash;For this mitigation he contends,
as a &s;y&s;tem agreeable to the ideas of good|ne&s;s
and mercy, which we annex to the
&s;upreme Being&mdash;Our aunt &s;eemed will|ing
to adopt this doctrine in favour of the
wicked; but he hinted, that no per&s;on
whatever was &s;o righteous as to be ex|empted
entirely from puni&s;hment in a fu|ture
&s;tate; and that the mo&s;t pious Chri|&s;tian
upon earth might think him&s;elf ve|ry
happy to get off for a fa&s;t of &s;even or
<PB N="14" REF="16">
eight thou&s;and years in the mid&s;t of fire
and brim&s;tone. Mrs. Tabitha revolted
at this dogma, which filled her at once
with horror and indignation&mdash;She had re|cour&s;e
to the opinion of Humphry Clin|ker,
who roundly declared it was the
popi&s;h doctrine of purgatory, and quoted
&s;cripture in defence of the <HI>fire everla&s;ting,
prepared for the devil and his angels</HI>&mdash;The
reverend me&s;ter Mackcorkendale, and all
the theologi&s;ts and &s;aints of that per&s;ua|&s;ion
were con&s;ulted, and &s;ome of them
had doubts about the matter; which
doubts and &s;cruples had begun to infect
our aunt, when we took our departure
from Edinburgh.</P>
<P>We pa&s;&s;ed through Linlithgow, where
there was an elegant royal palace, which
is now gone to decay, as well as the town
it&s;elf&mdash;This too is pretty much the ca&s;e
with Stirling, though it &s;till boa&s;ts of a
fine old ca&s;tle, in which the kings of
Scotland were wont to re&s;ide in their mi|nority&mdash;But
Gla&s;gow is the pride of Scot|land,
and, indeed, it might very well pa&s;s for
an elegant and flouri&s;hing city in any part
of Chri&s;tendom. There we had the good
fortune to be received into the hou&s;e of
Mr. Moore, an eminent &s;urgeon, to
whom we were recommended by one of
<PB N="15" REF="17">
our friends at Edinburgh; and, truly,
he could not have done us more e&s;&s;en|tial
&s;ervice&mdash;Mr. Moore is a merry fa|cetious
companion, &s;en&s;ible and &s;hrewd,
with a con&s;iderable fund of humour; and
his wife an agreeable woman, well bred,
kind, and obliging&mdash;Kindne&s;s, which I
take to be the e&s;&s;ence of good-nature and
humanity, is the di&s;tingui&s;hing characte|ri&s;tic
of the Scotch ladies in their own
country&mdash;Our landlord &s;hewed us every
thing, and introduced us to all the world
at Gla&s;gow; where, through his recom|mendation,
we were complimented with
the freedom of the town. Con&s;idering
the trade and opulence of this place, it
cannot but abound with gaiety and di|ver&s;ions&mdash;Here
is a great number of
young fellows that rival the youth of the
capital in &s;pirit and expence; and I was
&s;oon convinced, that all the female beau|ties
of Scotland were not a&s;&s;embled at
the hunters ball in Edinburgh&mdash;The
town of Gla&s;gow flouri&s;hes in learning, as
well as in commerce&mdash;Here is an univer|&s;ity,
with profe&s;&s;ors in all the different
branches of &s;cience, liberally endowed,
and judiciou&s;ly cho&s;en&mdash;It was vacation
time when I pa&s;&s;ed, &s;o that I could not
entirely &s;atisfy my curio&s;ity; but their
<PB N="16" REF="18">
mode of education is certainly preferable
to ours in &s;ome re&s;pects&mdash;The &s;tudents
are not left to the private in&s;truction of
tutors; but taught, in public &s;chools or
cla&s;&s;es, each &s;cience by its particular pro|fe&s;&s;or
or regent.</P>
<P>My uncle is in raptures with Gla&s;gow
&mdash;He not only vi&s;ited all the manufac|tures
of the place, but made excur&s;ions
all round, to Hamilton, Pai&s;ley, Ren|frew,
and every other place within a
dozen miles, where there was any thing
remarkable to be &s;een in art or nature.
I believe the exerci&s;e, occa&s;ioned by the&s;e
jaunts, was of &s;ervice to my &s;i&s;ter Liddy,
who&s;e appetite and &s;pirits begin to revive
&mdash;Mrs. Tabitha di&s;played her attractions
as u&s;ual, and actually believed &s;he had en|tangled
one Mr. Maclellan, a rich inkle-manufacturer,
in her &s;nares; but when
matters came to an explanation, it ap|peared
that his attachment was altogether
&s;piritual, founded upon an intercour&s;e of
devotion, at the meeting of Mr. John
We&s;ley; who, in the cour&s;e of his evan|gelical
mi&s;&s;ion, had come hither in per|&s;on&mdash;At
length, we &s;et out for the banks
of Lough-Lomond, pa&s;&s;ing through the lit|tle
borough of Dumbarton, or (as my un|cle
will have it) Dunbritton, where there
<PB N="17" REF="19">
is a ca&s;tle, more curious than any thing of
the kind I had ever &s;een&mdash;It is honoured
with a particular de&s;cription by the ele|gant
Buchannan, as an <HI>arx inexpugnabilis,</HI>
and, indeed, it mu&s;t have been impreg|nable
by the antient manner of be&s;ieging.
It is a rock of con&s;iderable extent, ri&s;ing
with a double top, in an angle formed by
the confluence of two rivers, the Clyde
and the Leven; perpendicular and inac|ce&s;&s;ible
on all &s;ides, except in one place
where the entrance is fortified; and there
is no ri&s;ing-ground in the neighbourhood
from whence it could be damaged by any
kind of battery.</P>
<P>From Dumbarton, the We&s;t High|lands
appear in the form of huge, du&s;ky
mountains, piled one over another; but
this pro&s;pect is not at all &s;urpri&s;ing to a na|tive
of Glamorgan&mdash;We have fixed our
head-quarters at Cameron, a very neat
country-hou&s;e belonging to commi&s;&s;ary
Smollett, where we found every &s;ort of
accommodation we could de&s;ire&mdash;It is
&s;ituated like a Druid's temple, in a grove
of oak, clo&s;e by the &s;ide of Lough-|Lomond,

tru&s;t her&s;elf again upon the water, and
to come hither it was nece&s;&s;ary to cro&s;s a
&s;mall inlet of the &s;ea, in an open ferry|boat&mdash;This
country appears more and

<P>When the Lowlanders want to drink a
chearupping-cup, they go to the public
hou&s;e, called the Change-hou&s;e, and call
for a chopine of two-penny, which is a
thin, yea&s;ty beverage, made of malt;
not quite &s;o &s;trong as the table-beer of
England&mdash;This is brought in a pewter
&s;toop, &s;haped like a &s;kittle, from whence
it is emptied into a quaff; that is a curi|ous
cup made of different pieces of wood,
&s;uch as box and ebony, cut into little

with delicate hoops, having two ears or
handles&mdash;It holds about a gill, is &s;ome|times
tipt round the mouth with &s;ilver,
and has a plate of the &s;ame metal at bot|tom,
with the landlord's cypher engraved
&mdash;The Highlanders, on the contrary, de|&s;pi&s;e
this liquor, and regale them&s;elves
with whi&s;ky; a malt &s;pirit, as &s;trong as
geneva, which they &s;wallow in great
quantities, without any &s;igns of inebria|tion.
They are u&s;ed to it from the cra|dle,
and find it an excellent pre&s;ervative
again&s;t the winter cold, which mu&s;t be
extreme on the&s;e mountains&mdash;I am told
that it is given with great &s;ucce&s;s to in|fants,
as a cordial in the confluent &s;mall|pox,
when the erruption &s;eems to flag,
and the &s;ymptoms grow unfavourable&mdash;
The Highlanders are u&s;ed to eat much
more animal food than falls to the &s;hare
of their neighbours in the Low-country&mdash;
They delight in hunting; have plenty of
deer and other game, with a great num|ber
of &s;heep, goats, and black-cattle run|ning
wild, which they &s;cruple not to kill
as veni&s;on, without being at much pains

<P>Inverary is but a poor town, though it
&s;tands immediately under the protection
<PB N="20" REF="22">
of the duke of Argyle, who is a mighty
prince in this part of Scotland. The
pea&s;ants live in wretched cabins, and
&s;eem very poor; but the gentlemen are
tolerably well lodged, and &s;o loving to
&s;trangers, that a man runs &s;ome ri&s;que of
his life from their ho&s;pitality&mdash;It mu&s;t
be ob&s;erved that the poor Highlanders
are now &s;een to di&s;advantage&mdash;They have
been not only di&s;armed by act of parlia|ment;
but al&s;o deprived of their antient
garb, which was both graceful and con|venient;
and what is a greater hard&s;hip
&s;till, they are compelled to wear breeches;
a re&s;traint which they cannot bear with
any degree of patience: indeed, the ma|jority
wear them, not in the proper place,
but on poles or long &s;taves over their
&s;houlders&mdash;They are even debared the
u&s;e of their &s;triped &s;tuff, called Tartane,
which was their own manufacture, prized
by them above all the velvets, brocards,
and ti&s;&s;ues of Europe and A&s;ia. They
now lounge along in loo&s;e great coats, of
coar&s;e ru&s;&s;et, equally mean and cumber|&s;ome,

it is, the government

at who&s;e hou&s;e we dined a few days ago,
can repeat them all in the original Gaelick,
which has a great affinity to the Welch,
not only in the general &s;ound, but al&s;o in
a great number of radical words; and I
make no doubt but that they are both
&s;prung from the &s;ame origin. I was not

Low-country, but Sa&s;&s;enagh, or Saxons;
<PB N="22" REF="24">
a &s;trong pre&s;umption, that the Lowland

Welch&mdash;It mu&s;t be owned, however, that
this people are better provided than we in
&s;ome articles&mdash;They have plenty of red
deer and roebuck, which are fat and de|licious
at this &s;ea&s;on of the year&mdash;Their
&s;ea teems with amazing quantities of the

means to procure very good claret at a
very &s;mall expence.</P>
<P>Our landlord is a man of con&s;equence
in this part of the country; a cadet from
the family of Argyle, and hereditary cap|tain
of one of his ca&s;tles&mdash;His name, in
plain Engli&s;h, is Dougal Campbell; but
as there is a great number of the &s;ame
appellation, they are di&s;tingui&s;hed (like
the Welch) by patronimics; and as I
have known an antient Briton called Ma|doc
ap-Morgan, ap-Jenkin, ap-Jones, our
Highland chief de&s;igns him&s;elf Dou'l
Mac-ami&s;h mac-'oul ich-ian, &s;ignifying

Dougal, the &s;on of James, the &s;on of
Dougal, the &s;on of John&mdash;He has travel|ed
in the cour&s;e of his education, and is
di&s;po&s;ed to make certain alterations in his
dome&s;tic oeconomy; but he finds it im|po&s;&s;ible
to aboli&s;h the antient cu&s;toms of
the family; &s;ome of which are ludicrous
enough&mdash;His piper, for example, who is
an hereditary officer of the hou&s;ehold,
will not part with the lea&s;t particle of his
privileges&mdash;He has a right to wear the
kilt, or antient Highland dre&s;s, with the
pur&s;e, pi&s;tol, and durk&mdash;a broad yellow
ribbon, fixed to the chanter-pipe, is
thrown over his &s;houlder, and trails along
the ground, while he performs the func|tion
of his min&s;trel&s;y; and this, I &s;up|po&s;e,
is analogous to the pennon or flag
which was formerly carried before every
knight in battle&mdash;He plays before the
laird every Sunday in his way to the kirk,
which he circles three times, perform|ing
the family march, which implies de|fiance
to all the enemies of the clan; and
every morning he plays a full hour by the
clock, in the great hall, marching back|wards
and forwards all the time, with a
&s;olemn pace, attended by the laird's kin&s;|men,
who &s;eem much delighted with the

with a variety of pibrachs or airs, &s;uited
to the different pa&s;&s;ions, which he would
either excite or a&s;&s;uage.</P>
<P>Mr. Campbell him&s;elf, who performs
very well on the violin, has an invincible
antipathy to the &s;ound of the Highland
bag-pipe, which &s;ings in the no&s;e with a
mo&s;t alarming twang, and, indeed, is
quite intolerable to ears of common &s;en|&s;ibility,
when aggravated by the echo of a
vaulted hall&mdash;He therefore begged the
piper would have &s;ome mercy upon him,
and di&s;pen&s;e with this part of the morn|ing
&s;ervice&mdash;A con&s;ultation of the clan
being held on this occa&s;ion, it was unani|mou&s;ly
agreed, that the laird's reque&s;t
could not be granted without a danger|ous
encroachment upon the cu&s;toms of
the family&mdash;The piper declared, he could
not give up for a moment the privilege he
derived from his ance&s;tors; nor would
the laird's relations forego an entertain|ment
which they valued above all others
&mdash;There was no remedy; Mr. Campbell,
being obliged to acquie&s;ce, is fain to &s;top
his ears with cotton; to fortify his head
with three or four night-caps, and every
morning retire into the penetralia of his
habitation, in order to avoid this diurnal
annoyance. When the mu&s;ic cea&s;es, he
<PB N="25" REF="27">
produces him&s;elf at an open window that
looks into the court-yard, which is by
this time filled with a crowd of his va&s;&s;als
and dependents, who wor&s;hip his fir&s;t ap|pearance,
by uncovering their heads, and
bowing to the earth with the mo&s;t humble
pro&s;tration. As all the&s;e people have
&s;omething to communicate in the way of
propo&s;al, complaint, or petition, they
wait patiently till the laird comes &s;orth,
and, following him in his walks, are fa|voured
each with a &s;hort audience in his
turn. Two days ago, he di&s;patched above
an hundred different &s;ollicitors, in walk|ing
with us to the hou&s;e of a neighbour|ing
gentleman, where we dined by invita|tion.
Our landlord's hou&s;e-keeping is
equally rough and ho&s;pitable, and &s;avours
much of the &s;implicity of ancient times:
the great hall, paved with fiat &s;tones, is
about forty-five feet by twenty-two, and
&s;erves not only for a dining-room, but al|&s;o
for a bed-chamber to gentlemen-de|pendents
and hangers-on of the family. At
night, half a dozen occa&s;ional beds are rang|ed
on each &s;ide along the wall. The&s;e are
made of fre&s;h heath, pulled up by the roots,
and di&s;po&s;ed in &s;uch a manner as to make
a very agreeable couch, where they l$e,
without any other covering than the plaid
&mdash;My uncle and I were indulged with &s;e|parate
<PB N="26" REF="28">
chambers and down beds, which
we begged to exchange for a layer of
heath; and indeed I never &s;lept &s;o much
to my &s;atisfaction. It was not only &s;oft and
ela&s;tic, but the plant, being in flower, dif|fu&s;ed
an agreeable fragrance, which is
wonderfully refre&s;hing and re&s;torative.</P>
<P>Ye&s;terday we were invited to the fune|ral
of an old lady, the grand-mother of a
gentleman in this neighbourhood, and
found our&s;elves in the mid&s;t of fifty
people, who were regaled with a &s;ump|tuous
fea&s;t, accompanied by the mu&s;ic of
a dozen pipers. In &s;hort, this meeting
had all the air of a grand fe&s;tival; and
the gue&s;ts did &s;uch honour to the enter|tainment,
that many of them could not
&s;tand when we were reminded of the
bu&s;ine&s;s on which we had met. The com|pany
forthwith taking hor&s;e, rode in a
very irregular cavalcade to the place of in|terment,
a church, at the di&s;tance of two
long miles from the ca&s;tle. On our arri|val,
however, we found we had commit|ted
a &s;mall over&s;ight, in leaving the corp&s;e
behind; &s;o that we were obliged to wheel
about, and met the old gentlewoman half
way, carried upon poles by the neare&s;t re|lations
of her family, and attended by
the <HI>coronach,</HI> compo&s;ed of a multitude of
old hags, who tore their hair, beat their
<PB N="27" REF="29">
brea&s;ts, and howled mo&s;t hideou&s;ly. At
the grave, the orator, or <HI>&s;enachie,</HI> pro|nounced
the panegyric of the defunct,
every period being confirmed by a yell of
the <HI>coronach.</HI> The body was committed
to the earth, the pipers playing a pibroch
all the time; and all the company &s;tand|ing
uncovered. The ceremony was
clo&s;ed with the di&s;charge of pi&s;tols; then
we returned to the ca&s;tle, re&s;umed the
bottle, and by midnight there was not
a &s;ober per&s;on in the family, the females
excepted. The '&s;quire and I were, with
&s;ome difficulty, permitted to retire with
our landlord in the evening; but our en|tertainer
was a little chagrined at our re|treat;
and afterwards &s;eemed to think it
a di&s;paragement to his family, that not
above a hundred gallons of whi&s;ky had
been drank upon &s;uch a &s;olemn occa&s;ion.
This morning we got up by four, to hunt
the roebuck, and, in an half an hour,
found breakfa&s;t ready &s;erved in the hall.
The hunters con&s;i&s;ted of Sir George Col|quhoun
and me, as &s;trangers, (my uncle
not chu&s;ing to be of the party) of the
<HI>laird in per&s;on, the laird's brother, the laird's
brother's &s;on, the laird's &s;i&s;ter's &s;on, the
laird's father's brother's &s;on,</HI> and all their
<HI>fo&s;ter brothers,</HI> who are counted parcel of
the family: but we were attended by an
<PB N="28" REF="30">
infinite number of <HI>Gaellys,</HI> or ragged
Highlanders, without &s;hoes or &s;tockings.</P>
<P>The following articles formed our
morning's repa&s;t: one kit of boiled eggs;
a &s;econd, full of butter; a third, full of
cream; an entire chee&s;e, made of goat's
milk; a large earthen pot full of honey;
the be&s;t part of a ham; a cold veni&s;on
pa&s;ty; a bu&s;hel of oat meal, made in thin
cakes and bannocks, with a &s;mall wheaten
loaf in the middle for the &s;trangers; a large
&s;tone bottle full of whi&s;ky, another of
brandy, and a kilderkin of ale. There
was a laddle chained to the cream kit,
with curious wooden bickers to be filled
from this re&s;ervoir. The &s;pirits were
drank out of a &s;ilver quaff, and the ale
out of horns: great ju&s;tice was done to
the collation by the gue&s;ts in general;
one of them in particular ate above two
dozen of hard eggs, with a proportion|able
quantity of bread, butter, and ho|ney;
nor was one drop of liquor left up|on
the board. Finally, a large roll of
tobacco was pre&s;ented by way of de&s;ert,
and every individual took a comfortable
quid, to prevent the bad effects of the
morning air. We had a fine chace over
the mountains, after a roebuck, which
we killed, and I got home time enough
<PB N="29" REF="31">
to drink tea with Mrs. Campbell and our
'&s;quire. To-morrow we &s;hall &s;et out on our
return for Cameron. We propo&s;e to cro&s;s
the Frith of Clyde, and take the towns of
Greenock and Port-Gla&s;gow in our way.

<OPENER>To Dr. LEWIS.
DEAR DICK,</OPENER>
<P>ABOUT a fortnight is now elap&s;ed,
&s;ince we left the capital of Scotland, di|recting
our cour&s;e towards Stirling, where
we lay&mdash;The ca&s;tle of this place is &s;uch
another as that of Edinburgh, and affords
a &s;urpri&s;ing pro&s;pect of the windings of
the river Forth, which are &s;o extraordina|ry,
that the di&s;tance from hence to Alloa
by land, is but four miles, and by water it is
twenty-four. Alloa is a neat thriving
town, that depends in a great mea&s;ure on
the commerce of Gla&s;gow, the merchants
of which &s;end hither tobacco and other
articles, to be depo&s;ited in warehou&s;es for
exportation from the Frith of Forth. In
our way hither we vi&s;ited a flouri&s;hing
iron-work, where, in&s;tead of burning
wood, they u&s;e coal, which they have the
art of clearing in &s;uch a manner as
frees it from the &s;ulphur, that would
<PB N="31" REF="33">
otherwi&s;e render the metal too brittle for
working. Excellent coal is found in al|mo&s;t
every part of Scotland.</P>
<P>The &s;oil of this di&s;trict produces &s;carce
any other grain but oats and barley; per|haps
becau&s;e it is poorly cultivated, and
almo&s;t altogether uninclo&s;ed. The few
inclo&s;ures they have con&s;i&s;t of paultry
walls of loo&s;e &s;tones gathered from the
fields, which indeed they cover, as if they
had been &s;cattered on purpo&s;e. When I
expre&s;&s;ed my &s;urprize that the pea&s;ants
did not di&s;encumber their grounds of the&s;e
&s;tones; a gentleman, well aquainted with
the theory as well as practice of farming,
a&s;&s;ured me that the &s;tones, far from being
prejudicial, were &s;erviceable to the crop.
This philo&s;opher had ordered a field of his
own to be cleared, manured and &s;own with
barley, and the produce was more &s;canty
than before. He cau&s;ed the &s;tones to be
replaced, and next year the crop was as
good as ever. The &s;tones were removed
a &s;econd time, and the harve&s;t &s;ailed; they
were again brought back, and the ground
retrieved its fertility. The &s;ame experi|ment
has been tried in different parts of
Scotland with the &s;ame &s;ucce&s;s&mdash;A&s;toni&s;h|ed
at this information, I de&s;ired to know
in what manner be accounted for this
<PB N="32" REF="34">
&s;trange phenomenon; and he &s;aid there
were three ways in which the &s;tones might
be &s;erviceable. They might po&s;&s;ibly re|&s;train
an exce&s;s in the per&s;piration of the
earth, analogous to colliquative &s;weats,
by which the human body is &s;ometimes
wa&s;ted and con&s;umed. They might act
as &s;o many fences to protect the tender
blade from the piercing winds of the
&s;pring; or, by multiplying the reflexion
of the &s;un, they might increa&s;e the warmth,
&s;o as to mitigate the naural chilne&s;s of
the &s;oil and climate&mdash;But, &s;urely this ex|exce&s;&s;ive
per&s;piration might be more ef|fectually
checked by different kinds of
manure, &s;uch as a&s;hes, lime, chalk, or
marl, of which la&s;t it &s;eems there are
many pits in this kingdom: as for the
warmth, it would be much more equally
obtained by inclo&s;ures; one half of the
ground which is now covered, would be
retrieved; the cultivation would require
le&s;s labour; and the ploughs, harrows,
and hor&s;es, would not &s;uffer half the da|mage
which they now &s;u&s;tain.</P>
<P>The&s;e north-we&s;tern parts are by no means
fertile in corn. The ground is naturally
barren and moori&s;h. The pea&s;ants are poor|ly
lodged, meagre in their looks, mean
in their apparel, and remarkably dirty.
<PB N="33" REF="35">
This la&s;t reproach they might ea&s;ily wa&s;h
off, by means of tho&s;e lakes, rivers, and
rivulets of pure water, with which they
are &s;o liberally &s;upplied by nature. Agri|culture
cannot be expected to flouri&s;h
where the farms are &s;mall, the lea&s;es &s;hort,
and the hu&s;bandman begins upon a rack
rent, without a &s;ufficient &s;tock to an&s;wer
the purpo&s;es of improvement. The gra|naries
of Scotland are the banks of the
Tweed, the counties of Ea&s;t and Mid-Lothian,
the Car&s;e of Gowrie, in Perth|&s;hire,
equal in fertility to any part of
England, and &s;ome tracts in Aberdeen|&s;hire
and Murray, where I am told the
harve&s;t is more early than in Northum|berland,
although they lie above two de|grees
farther north. I have a &s;trong cu|rio&s;ity
to vi&s;it many places beyond the
Forth and the Tay, &s;uch as Perth, Dun|dee,
Montro&s;e, and Aberdeen, which
are towns equally elegant and thriving;
but the &s;ea&s;on is too far advanced, to ad|mit
of this addition to my original plan.</P>
<P>I am &s;o far happy as to have &s;een
Gla&s;gow, which, to the be&s;t of my recol|lection
and judgment, is one of the pret|tie&s;t
towns in Europe; and, without all
doubt, it is one of the mo&s;t flouri&s;hing in
Great Britain. In &s;hort, it is a perfect
<PB N="34" REF="36">
bee-hive in point of indu&s;try. It &s;tands
partly on a gentle declivity; but the
greate&s;t part of it is in a plain, watered by
the river Clyde. The &s;treets are &s;traight,
open, airy, and well paved; and the
hou&s;es lofty and well built of hewn
&s;tone. At the upper end of the town,
there is a venerable cathedral, that may
be compared with York min&s;ter or We&s;t|min&s;ter;
and, about the middle of the
de&s;cent from this to the Cro&s;s, is the col|lege,
a re&s;pectable pile of building, with
all manner of accommodation for the pro|fe&s;&s;ors
and &s;tudents, including an elegant
library, and an ob&s;ervatory well provid|ed
with a&s;tronomical in&s;truments. The
number of inhabitants is &s;aid to amount
to thirty thou&s;and; and marks of opu|lence
and independency appear in every
quarter of this commercial city, which,
however, is not without its inconveniences
and defects The water of their public
pumps is generally hard and bracki&s;h,
an imperfection the le&s;s excu&s;able, as the
river Clyde runs by their doors, in the
lower part of the town; and there are ri|vulets
and &s;prings above the cathedral,
&s;ufficient to fill a large re&s;ervoir with ex|cellent
water, which might be thence di&s;tri|buted
to all the different parts of the ci|ty.

It is of more con&s;equence to con&s;ult
the health of the inhabitants in this ar|ticle,
than to employ &s;o much attention in
beautifying their town with new &s;treets,
&s;quares, and churches. Another defect,
not &s;o ea&s;ily remedied, is the &s;hallowne&s;s
of the river, which will not float ve&s;&s;els
of any burthen within ten or twelve
miles of the city; &s;o that the merchants
are obliged to load and unload their &s;hips
at Greenock and Port-Gla&s;gow, &s;ituated
about fourteen miles nearer the mouth of
the Frith, where it is about two miles
broad.</P>
<P>The people of Gla&s;gow have a noble
&s;pirit of enterpri&s;e&mdash;Mr. Moore, a &s;ur|geon,
to whom I was recommended from
Edinburgh, introduced me to all the prin|cipal
merchants of the place. Here I
became acquainted with Mr. Cochran,
who may be &s;tiled one of the &s;ages of this
kingdom. He was fir&s;t magi&s;trate at the
time of the la&s;t rebellion. I &s;at as mem|ber
when he was examined in the hou&s;e
of commons; upon which occa&s;ion Mr.
P&mdash;ob&s;erved he had never heard &s;uch
a &s;en&s;ible evidence given at that bar&mdash;I
was al&s;o introduced to Dr. John Gordon,
patriot of a truly Roman &s;pirit, who is the
father of the linen manufacture in this
<PB N="36" REF="38">
place, and was the great promoter of the
city workhou&s;e, infirmary, and other
works of public utility. Had he lived
in ancient Rome, he would have been
honoured with a &s;tatue at the public ex|pence.
I moreover conver&s;ed with one
Mr. G&mdash;&s;sf&mdash;d, whom I take to be one
of the greate&s;t merchants in Europe. In
the la&s;t war, he is &s;aid to have had at one
time five and twenty &s;hips, with their
cargoes, his own property, and to have
traded for above half a million &s;terling
a year. The la&s;t war was a fortunate pe|riod
for the commerce of Gla&s;gow&mdash;The
merchants, con&s;idering that their &s;hips
bound for America, launching out at once
into the Atlantic by the north of Ireland,
pur&s;ued a track very little frequented by
privateers, re&s;olved to in&s;ure one another,
and &s;aved a very con&s;iderable &s;um by this
re&s;olution, as few or none of their &s;hips
were taken&mdash;You mu&s;t know I have a
&s;ort of national attachment to this part of
Scotland&mdash;The great church dedicated to
St. Mongah, the river Clyde, and other
particulars that &s;mack of our Welch lan|guage
and cu&s;toms, contribute to flatter
me with the notion, that the&s;e people are
the de&s;cendants of the Britons, who once
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed this country. Without all que&s;|tion,
<PB N="37" REF="39">
this was a Cumbrian kingdom: its
capital was Dumbarton (a corruption of
Dumbritton) which &s;till exi&s;ts as a royal
borough, at the influx of the Clyde and
Leven, ten miles below Gla&s;gow. The
&s;ame neighbourhood gave birth to St.
Patrick, the apo&s;tle of Ireland, at a place
where there is &s;till a church and village,
which retain his name. Hard by are
&s;ome ve&s;tiges of the famous Roman wall,
built in the reign of Antonine, from the
Clyde to the Forth, and fortified with
ca&s;tles, to re&s;train the incur&s;ions of the
Scots or Caledonians, who inhabited the
We&s;t-Highlands. In a line parallel to this
wall, the merchants of Gla&s;gow have de|termined
to make a navigable canal be|twixt
the two Friths, which will be of in|credible
advantage to their commerce, in
tran&s;porting merchandize from one &s;ide
of the i&s;land to the other.</P>
<P>From Gla&s;gow we travelled along the
Clyde, which is a delightful &s;tream, ad|orned
on both &s;ides with villas, towns,
and villages. Here is no want of groves,
and meadows, and corn-fields inter|&s;per&s;ed;
but on this &s;ide of Gla&s;gow,
there is little other grain than oats and
barley; the fir&s;t are much better, the la&s;t
much wor&s;e, than tho&s;e of the &s;ame &s;pe|cies
<PB N="38" REF="40">
in England. I wonder, there is &s;o
little rye, which is a grain that will thrive
in almo&s;t any &s;oil; and it is &s;till more
&s;urpri&s;ing, that the cultivation of pota|toes
&s;hould be &s;o much neglected in the
Highlands, where the poor people have
not meal enough to &s;upply them with
bread through the winter. On the other
&s;ide of the river are the towns of Pai&s;ley
and Renfrew. The fir&s;t, from an incon|&s;iderable
village, is become one of the
mo&s;t flouri&s;hing places of the kingdom,
enriched by the linen, cambrick&punc; flowered
lawn, and &s;ilk manufactures. It was for|merly
noted for a rich mona&s;tery of the
monks of Clugny, who wrote the famous
<HI>Scoti-Chronicon,</HI> called <HI>The Black Book of
Pai&s;ley.</HI> The old abbey &s;till remains, con|verted
into a dwelling-hou&s;e, belonging to
the earl of Dundonald. Renfrew is a pretty
town, on the banks of Clyde, capital of
the &s;hire, which was heretofore the patri|mony
of the Stuart family, and gave the
title of baron to the king's elde&s;t &s;on,
which is &s;till a&s;&s;umed by the prince of
Wales.</P>
<P>The Clyde we left a little on our left-hand
at Dunbritton, where it widens into
an ae&s;tuary or frith, being augmented by
the influx of the Leven. On this &s;po$
<PB N="39" REF="41">
&s;tands the ca&s;tle formerly called Alcluyd,
wa&s;hed by the&s;e two rivers on all &s;ides,
except a narrow i&s;thmus, which at
every &s;pring-tide is overflowed. The
whole is a great curio&s;ity, from the quality
and form of the rock, as well as from the
nature of its &s;ituation&mdash;We now cro&s;&s;ed
the water of Leven, which, though no|thing
near &s;o con&s;iderable as the Clyde, is
much more tran&s;parent, pa&s;toral, and de|lightful.
This charming &s;tream is the
outlet of Lough-Lomond, and through a
tract of four miles pur&s;ues its winding
cour&s;e, murmuring over a bed of pebbles,
till it joins the Frith at Dunbritton. A
very little above its &s;ource, on the lake,
&s;tands the hou&s;e of Cameron, belonging
to Mr. Smollett, &s;o embo&s;omed in an oak
wood, that we did not &s;ee it till we were
within fifty yards of the door. I have
&s;een the Lago di Garda, Albano, De Vico,
Bol&s;ena, and Geneva, and, upon my ho|nour,
I prefer Lough-Lomond to them all;
a preference which is certainly owing to
the verdant i&s;lands that &s;eem to float upon
its &s;urface, affording the mo&s;t inchanting
objects of repo&s;e to the excur&s;ive view.
Nor are the banks de&s;titute of beauties,
which even partake of the &s;ublime. On
this &s;ide they di&s;play a &s;weet variety of
<PB N="40" REF="42">
woodland, corn-field, and pa&s;ture, with
&s;everal agreeable villas emerging as it
were out of the lake, till, at &s;ome di&s;tance,
the pro&s;pect terminates in huge moun|tains
covered with heath, which being in
the bloom, affords a very rich covering
of purple. Every thing here is romantic
beyond imagination. This country is
ju&s;tly &s;tiled the Arcadia of Scotland; and
I don't doubt but it may vie with Arca|dia
in every thing but climate.&mdash;I am
&s;ure it excels it in verdure, wood, and
water.&mdash;What &s;ay you to a natural ba&s;on

<OPENER>To DR. LEWIS.
DEAR DOCTOR,</OPENER>
<P>IF I was di&s;po&s;ed to be critical, I
&s;hould &s;ay this hou&s;e of Cameron is too
near the lake, which approaches, on one
&s;ide, to within &s;ix or &s;even yards of the
window. It might have been placed in a
higher &s;ite, which would have afforded a
more exten&s;ive pro&s;pect and a drier at|mo&s;phere;
but this imperfection is not
chargeable on the pre&s;ent proprietor, who
purcha&s;ed it ready built, rather than be
at the trouble of repairing his own family-hou&s;e
of Bonhill, which &s;tands two miles
from hence on the Leven, &s;o &s;urrounded
with plantation, that it u&s;ed to be known
by the name of the Mavis (or thru&s;h) Ne&s;t.
Above that hou&s;e is a romantic glen or clift
of a mountain, covered with hanging woods,
having at bottom a &s;tream of fine water
that forms a number of ca&s;cades in its
de&s;cent to join the Leven; &s;o that the
<PB N="44" REF="46">
&s;cene is quite enchanting. A captain of
a man of war, who had made the circuit of
the globe with Mr. An&s;on, being con|ducted
to this glen, exclaimed, &startq;Juan
Fernandez, by God!&endq;</P>
<P>Indeed, this country would be a per|fect
paradi&s;e, if it was not, like Wales,
cur&s;ed with a weeping climate, owing to
the &s;ame cau&s;es in both, the neighbour|hood
of high mountains, and a we&s;terly
&s;ituation, expo&s;ed to the vapours of the
Atlantic ocean. This air, however, not|with&s;tanding
its humidity, is &s;o healthy,
that the natives are &s;carce ever vi&s;ited by
any other di&s;ea&s;e than the &s;mall-pox, and
certain cutaneous evils, which are the
effects of dirty living, the great and ge|neral
reproach of the commonalty of this
kingdom. Here are a great many living
monuments of longaevity; and among
the re&s;t a per&s;on, whom I treat with &s;in|gular
re&s;pect, as a venerable druid, who
has lived near ninety years, without pain
or &s;ickne&s;s, among oaks of his own plant|ing.&mdash;He
was once proprietor of the&s;e
lands; but being of a projecting &s;pirit,
&s;ome of his &s;chemes mi&s;carried, and he
was obliged to part with his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion,
which hath &s;hifted hands two or three
times &s;ince that period; but every &s;uc|ceeding
<PB N="45" REF="47">
proprietor hath done every thing
in his power, to make his old age ea&s;y and
comfortable. He has a &s;ufficiency to
procure the nece&s;&s;aries of life; and he
and his old woman re&s;ided in a &s;mall con|venient
farm-hou&s;e, having a little garden
which he cultivates with his own hands. This
ancient couple live in great health, peace,
and harmony, and, knowing no wants, enjoy
the perfection of content. Mr. Smollet
calls him the admiral, becau&s;e he in&s;i&s;ts
upon &s;teering his plea&s;ure-boat upon the
lake; and he &s;pends mo&s;t of his time in
ranging through the woods, which he de|clares
he enjoys as much as if they were
&s;till his own property&mdash;I a&s;ked him the
other day, if he was never &s;ick, and he
an&s;wered, Yes; he had a &s;light fever the
year before the union. If he was not
deaf, I &s;hould take much plea&s;ure in his
conver&s;ation; for he is very intelligent,
and his memory is &s;urpri&s;ingly retentive&mdash;
The&s;e are the happy effects of tempe|rance,
exerci&s;e, and good nature&mdash;Not|with&s;tanding
all his innocence, however,
he was the cau&s;e of great perturbation to
my man Clinker, who&s;e natural &s;uper&s;ti|tion
has been much injured, by the h$&s;to|ries
of witches, fairies, gho&s;ts, and gob|lins,
which he has heard in this country&mdash;
<PB N="46" REF="48">
On the evening after our arrival, Hum|phrey
&s;trolled into the wood, in the cour&s;e
of his meditation, and all at once the
admiral &s;tood before him, under the &s;ha|dow
of a &s;preading oak. Though the
fellow is far from being timorous in ca&s;es
that are not &s;uppo&s;ed preternatural, he
could not &s;tand the &s;ight of this appari|tion,
but ran into the kitchen, with his
hair &s;tanding on end, &s;taring wildly, and
deprived of utterance. Mrs. Jenkins, &s;ee|ing
him in this condition, &s;creamed aloud,
&startq;Lord have mercy upon us, he has &s;een
&s;omething!&endq; Mrs. Tabitha was alarm|ed,
and the whole hou&s;e in confu&s;ion.
When he was recruited with a dram, I
de&s;ired him to explain the meaning of all
this agitation; and, with &s;ome reluctance,
he owned he had &s;een a &s;pirit, in the &s;hape
of an old man with a white beard, a black
cap, and a plaid night gown. He was
undeceived by the admiral in per&s;on, who,
coming in at this juncture, appeared to
be a creature of real fle&s;h and blood.</P>
<P>Do you know how we fare in this Scot|ti&s;h
paradi&s;e? We make free with our
landlord's mutton, which is excellent, his
poultry-yard, his garden, his dairy, and
his cellar, which are all well &s;tored. We
have delicious &s;almon, pike, trout, perch,
<PB N="47" REF="49">
par, &amp;c. at the door, for the taking. The
Frith of Clyde, on the other &s;ide of the
hill, &s;upplies us with mullet, red and grey,
cod, mackarel, whiting, and a variety of
&s;ea-fi&s;h, including the fine&s;t fre&s;h herrings
I ever ta&s;ted. We have &s;weet, juicy beef,
and tolerable veal, with delicate bread
from the little town of Dunbritton; and
plenty of partridge, grow&s;e, heath-cock,
and other game in pre&s;ents.</P>
<P>We have been vi&s;ited by all the gentle|men
in the neighbourhood, and they have
entertained us at their hou&s;es, not barely
with ho&s;pitality, but with &s;uch marks of
cordial affection, as one would wi&s;h to
find among near relations, after an ab&s;ence
of many years.</P>
<P>I told you, in my la&s;t, I had projected
an excur&s;ion to the Highlands, which pro|ject
I have now happily executed, under
the au&s;pices of Sir George Colquhoun, a
colonel in the Dutch &s;ervice, who offered
him&s;elf as our conductor on this occa&s;ion.
Leaving our women at Cameron, to the
care and in&s;pection of Lady H&mdash;
C&mdash;, we &s;et out on hor&s;eback for In|verary,
the county town of Argyle, and
dined on the road with the Laird of Mac|farlane,
the greate&s;t genealogi&s;t I ever
knew in any country, and perfectly ac|quainted
<PB N="48" REF="50">
with all the antiquities of Scot|land.</P>
<P>The Duke of Argyle has an old ca&s;tle
at Inverary, where he re&s;ides when he is
in Scotland; and hard by is the &s;hell of
a noble Gothic palace, built by the la&s;t
duke, which, when fini&s;hed, will be a
great ornament to this part of the High|lands.
As for Inverary, it is a place of
very little importance.</P>
<P>This country is amazingly wild, e&s;pe|cially
towards the mountains, which are
heaped upon the backs of one another,
making a mo&s;t &s;tupendous appearance of
&s;avage nature, with hardly any &s;igns of
cultivation, or even of population. All
is &s;ublimity, &s;ilence, and &s;olitude. The
people live together in glens or bottoms,
where they are &s;heltered from the cold
and &s;torms of winter: but there is a mar|gin
of plain ground &s;pread along the &s;ea
&s;ide, which is well inhabited and improv|ed
by the arts of hu&s;bandry; and this I
take to be one of the mo&s;t agreeable tracts
of the whole i&s;land; the &s;ea not only keeps
it warm, and &s;upplies it with fi&s;h, but af|fords
one of the mo&s;t ravi&s;hing pro&s;pects
in the whole world; I mean the appear|ance
of the Hebrides, or We&s;tern I&s;lands,
to the number of three hundred, &s;cattered
<PB N="49" REF="51">
as far as the eye can reach, in the mo&s;t
agreeable confu&s;ion. As the &s;oil and cli|mate
of the Highlands are but ill adapted
to the cultivation of corn, the people ap|ply
them&s;elves chiefly to the breeding and
feeding of black cattle, which turn to
good account Tho&s;e animals run wild all
the winter, without any &s;helter or &s;ub&s;i&s;t|ence,
but what they can find among the
heath. When the &s;now lies &s;o deep and
hard, that they cannot penetrate to the
roots of the gra&s;s, they make a diurnal
progre&s;s, guided by a &s;ure in&s;tinct, to the
&s;ea-&s;ide at low water, where they feed
on the <HI>alga marina,</HI> and other plants that
grow upon the beach.</P>
<P>Perhaps this branch of hu&s;bandry,
which requires very little attendance and
labour, is one of the principal cau&s;es of
that idlene&s;s and want of indu&s;try, which
di&s;tingui&s;hes the&s;e mountaineers in their
own country&mdash;When they come forth in|to
the world, they become as diligent and
alert as any people upon earth. They are un|doubtedly
a very di&s;tinct &s;pecies from their
fellow-&s;ubjects of the Lowlands, again&s;t
whom they indulge an ancient &s;pirit of
animo&s;ity; and this difference is very di&s;|cernible
even among per&s;ons of family and
education. The Lowlanders are general|ly
<PB N="50" REF="52">
cool and circum&s;pect, the Highlanders
fiery and ferocious: but this violence of
their pa&s;&s;ions &s;erves only to inflame
the zeal of their devotion to &s;trangers,
which is truly enthu&s;ia&s;tic.</P>
<P>We proceeded about twenty miles be|yond
Inverary, to the hou&s;e of a gentle|man,
a friend of our conductor, where
we &s;tayed a few days, and were fea&s;ted in
&s;uch a manner, that I began to dread the
con&s;equence to my con&s;titution.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the &s;olitude that pre|vails
among the&s;e mountains, there is no
want of people in the Highlands. I am
credibly informed that the duke of Ar|gyle
can a&s;&s;emble five thou&s;and men in
arms, of his own clan and &s;urname, which
is Campbell; and there is be&s;ides a tribe
of the &s;ame appellation, who&s;e chief is
the Earl of Breadalbine. The Macdo|nalds
are as numerous, and remarkably
warlike: the Camerons, M 'Leods, Fra|&s;ers,
Grants, M 'Kenzies, M 'Kays,
M 'Pher&s;ons, M 'Into&s;hes, are powerful
clans; &s;o that if all the Highlanders, in|cluding
the inhabitants of th$ I&s;les, were
united, they could bring into the field an
army of forty thou&s;and fighting men, ca|pabable
of undertaking the mo&s;t danger|ous
enterprize. We have lived to &s;ee
<PB N="51" REF="53">
four thou&s;and of them, without di&s;cipline,
throw the whole kingdom of Great Bri|tain
into confu&s;ion. They attacked and
defeated two armies of regular troops,
accu&s;tomed to &s;ervice. They penetrated
into the centre of England; and after|wards
marched back with deliberation, in
the face of two other armies, through an
enemy's country, where every precaution
was taken to cut off their retreat. I know
not any other people in Europe, who,
without the u&s;e or knowledge of arms,
will attack regular forces &s;word in hand,
if their chief will head them in battle.
When di&s;ciplined, they cannot fail of be|ing
excellent &s;oldiers. They do not walk
like the generality of mankind, but trot
and bounce like deer, as if they moved
upon &s;prings. They greatly excel the
Lowlanders in all the exerci&s;es that re|quire
agility; they are incredibly ab&s;te|mious,
and patient of hunger and fatigue;
&s;o &s;teeled again&s;t the weather, that in tra|velling,
even when the ground is covered
with &s;now, they never look for a hou&s;e, or
any other &s;helter but their plaid, in which
they wrap them&s;elves up, and go to &s;leep
under the cope of heaven. Such people,
in quality of &s;oldiers, mu&s;t be invincible,
when the bu&s;ine&s;s is to perform quick
<PB N="52" REF="54">
marches in a difficult country, to &s;trike &s;ud|den
&s;trokes, beat up the enemy's quar|ters,
harra&s;s their cavalry, and perform
expeditions without the formality of ma|gazines,
baggage, forage, and artillery.
The chieftain&s;hip of the Highlanders is
a very dangerous influence operating at
the extremity of the i&s;land, where the
eyes and hands of government cannot be
&s;uppo&s;ed to &s;ee and act with preci&s;ion and
vigour. In order to break the force of
clan&s;hip, admini&s;tration has always prac|ti&s;ed
the political maxim, <HI>Divide et impera.</HI>
The legi&s;lature hath not only di&s;armed
the&s;e mountaineers, but al&s;o deprived them
of their ancient garb, which contributed
in a great mea&s;ure to keep up their mili|tary
&s;pirit; and their &s;lavi&s;h tenures are
all di&s;&s;olved by act of parliament; &s;o that
they are at pre&s;ent as free and independ|ent
of their chiefs, as the law can make
them: but the original attachment &s;till re|mains,
and is founded on &s;omething prior
to the <HI>feudal &s;y&s;tem,</HI> about which the wri|ters
of this age have made &s;uch a pother,
as if it was a new di&s;covery, like the <HI>Co|pernican
&s;y&s;tem.</HI> Every peculiarity of po|licy,
cu&s;tom, and even temperament, is
affectedly traced to this origin, as if the
feudal con&s;titution had not been common
<PB N="53" REF="55">
to almo&s;t all the natives of Europe. For
my part, I expect to &s;ee the u&s;e of trunk|ho&s;e
and buttered ale a&s;cribed to the in|fluence
of the <HI>feudal &s;y&s;tem.</HI> The connec|tion
between the clans and their chiefs is,
without all doubt, <HI>patriarchal.</HI> It is
founded on hereditary regard and affec|tion,
cheri&s;hed through a long &s;ucce&s;&s;ion
of ages. The clan con&s;ider the chief as
their father, they bear his name, they
believe them&s;elves de&s;cended from his fa|mily,
and they obey him as their lord,
with all the ardour of filial love and vene|ration;
while he, on his part, exerts a pa|ternal
authority, commanding, cha&s;ti&s;ing,
rewarding, protecting, and maintaining
them as his own children. If the legi&s;|lature
would entirely de&s;troy this connec|tion,
it mu&s;t compel the Highlanders to
change their habitation and their names.
Even this experiment has been formerly
tried without &s;ucce&s;s&mdash;In the reign of
James VI. a battle was fought with|in
a few &s;hort miles of this place, be|tween
two clans, the M 'Gregors and the
Colquhouns, in which the latter were de|feated:
the Laird of M 'Gregor made
&s;uch a barbarous u&s;e of his victory, that
he was forfeited and outlawed by act of
parliament: his lands were given to the
<PB N="54" REF="56">
family of Montro&s;e, and his clan were
obliged to change their name. They
obeyed &s;o far, as to call them&s;elves &s;eve|rally
Campbell, Graham, or Drummond,
the &s;urnames of the families of Argyle,
Montro&s;e, and Perth, that they might
enjoy the protection of tho&s;e hou&s;es; but
they &s;till added M 'Gregor to their new
appellation; and as their chief was de|prived
of his e&s;tate, they robbed and
plundered for his &s;ub&s;i&s;tence.&mdash;Mr. Ca|meron
of Lochiel, the chief of that clan,
who&s;e father was attainted for having
been concerned in the la&s;t rebellion, re|turning
from France in obedience to a pro|clamation
and act of parliament, pa&s;&s;ed
at the beginning of the late war, payed a
vi&s;it to his own country, and hired a farm
in the neighbourhood of his father's hou&s;e,
which had been burnt to the ground. The
clan, though ruined and &s;cattered, no &s;ooner
heard of his arrival than they flocked to
him from all quarters, to welcome his re|turn,
and in a few days &s;tocked his farm
with &s;even hundred black cattle, which
they had &s;aved in the general wreck of their
affairs: but their beloved chief, who was
a promi&s;ing youth, did not live to enjoy the
fruits of their fidelity and attachment.</P>
<P><PB N="55" REF="57">
The mo&s;t effectual method I know to
weaken, and at length de&s;troy this in|fluence,
is to employ the commonalty in
&s;uch a manner as to give them a ta&s;te of
property and independence&mdash;In vain the
government grants them advantageous
lea&s;es on the forfeited e&s;tates, if they have
no property to pro&s;ecute the means of
improvement&mdash;The &s;ea is an inexhau&s;ti|ble
fund of riches; but the fi&s;hery cannot
be carried on without ve&s;&s;els, ca&s;ks, &s;alt,
lines, nets, and other tackle. I conver&s;|ed
with a &s;en&s;ible man of this country,
who, from a real &s;pirit of patrioti&s;m, had
&s;et up a fi&s;hery on the coa&s;t, and a ma|nufacture
of coar&s;e linen, for the employ|ment
of the poor Highlanders. Cod is
here in &s;uch plenty, that he told me he
had &s;een &s;even hundred taken on one line,
at one hawl&mdash;It mu&s;t be ob&s;erved, how|ever,
that the line was of immen&s;e length,
and had two thou&s;and hooks, baited with
mu&s;cles; but the fi&s;h was &s;o &s;uperior to
the cod caught on the banks of New|foundland,
that his corre&s;pondent at Li&s;|bon
&s;old them immediately at his own
price, although Lent was ju&s;t over when
they arrived, and the people might be
&s;uppo&s;ed quite cloyed with this kind of
diet&mdash;His linen manufacture was like|wi&s;e
<PB N="56" REF="58">
in a pro&s;perous way, when the late
war intervening, all his be&s;t hands were
pre&s;&s;ed into the &s;ervice.</P>
<P>It cannot be expected, that the gentle|men
of this country &s;hould execute com|mercial
&s;chemes to render their va&s;&s;als
independent; nor, indeed, are &s;uch
&s;chemes &s;uited to their way of life and in|clination;
but a company of merchants
might, with proper management, turn to
good account a fi&s;hery e&s;tabli&s;hed in this
part of Scotland&mdash;Our people have a
&s;trange itch to colonize America, when
the uncultivated parts of our own i&s;land
might be &s;ettled to greater advantage.</P>
<P>After having rambled through the
mountains and glens of Argyle, we vi&s;it|ed
the adjacent i&s;lands of Ila, Jura, Mull,
and Icolmkill. In the fir&s;t, we &s;aw the re|mains
of a ca&s;tle, built in a lake, where
Macdonald, lord or king of the i&s;les,
formerly re&s;ided. Jura is famous for
having given birth to one Mackcrain,
who lived one hundred and eighty years
in one hou&s;e, and died in the reign of
Charles the Second. Mull affords &s;eve|ral
bays, where there is &s;afe anchorage;
in one of which, the Florida, a &s;hip of
the Spani&s;h armada, was blown up by one
of Mr. Smollett's ance&s;tors&mdash;About forty
<PB N="57" REF="59">
years ago, John duke of Argyle is &s;aid
to have con&s;ulted the Spani&s;h regi&s;ters,
by which it appeared, that this &s;hip had
the military che&s;t on board&mdash;He employed
experienced divers to examine the wreck;
and they found the hull of the ve&s;&s;el &s;till
entire, but &s;o covered with &s;and, that
they could not make their way between
decks; however, they picked up &s;eve|ral
pieces of plate, that were &s;cattered a|bout
in the bay, and a couple of fine bra&s;s
cannon.</P>
<P>Icolmkill, or Iona, is a &s;mall i&s;land
which St. Columba cho&s;e for his habita|tion&mdash;It
was re&s;pected for its &s;anctity,

<P>Having &s;ent round our hor&s;es by land,

<OPENER>To Mi&s;s LAETITIA WILLIS, at Glouce&s;ter.
MY DEAREST LETTY,</OPENER>
<P>NEVER did poor pri&s;oner long for
deliverance, more than I have longed for
an opportunity to di&s;burthen my cares in|to
your friendly bo&s;om; and the occa|&s;ion
which now pre&s;ents it&s;elf, is little le&s;s
than miraculous&mdash;Hone&s;t Saunders Mac|awly,
the travelling Scotchman, who goes
every year to Wales, is now at Gla&s;gow,
buying goods, and coming to pay his re|&s;pects
to our family, has undertaken to
deliver this letter into your own hand&mdash;
We have been &s;ix weeks in Scotland, and
&s;een the principal towns of the kingdom,
where we have been treated with great ci|vility&mdash;The
people are very courteous;
and the country being exceedingly ro|mantic,
&s;uits my turn and inclinations&mdash;
I contracted &s;ome friend&s;hips at Edin|burgh,
which is a large and lofty city,
full of gay company; and, in particular,
commenced an intimate corre&s;pondence
<PB N="60" REF="62">
with one mi&s;s R&mdash;t&mdash;n, an amiable
young lady of my own age, who&s;e charms
&s;eemed to &s;often, and even to &s;ubdue the
&s;tubborn heart of my brother Jery; but
he no &s;ooner left the place than he re|lap&s;ed
into his former in&s;en&s;ibility&mdash;I
feel, however, that this indifference is
not the family-con&s;titution&mdash;I never ad|mitted
but one idea of love, and that has
taken &s;uch root in my heart, as to be e|qually
proof again&s;t all the pulls of di&s;|cretion,
and the fro&s;ts of neglect.</P>
<P>Dear Letty! I had an alarming adven|ture
at the hunters ball in Edinburgh&mdash;
While I &s;at di&s;cour&s;ing with a friend in a
corner, all at once the very image of Wil|&s;on
&s;tood before me, dre&s;&s;ed exactly as
he was in the character of Aimwell! It
was one Mr. Gordon, whom I had not &s;een
before&mdash;Shocked at the &s;udden appari|tion,
I fainted away, and threw the whole
a&s;&s;embly in confu&s;ion&mdash;However, the
cau&s;e of my di&s;order remained a &s;ecret to
every body but my brother, who was
likewi&s;e &s;truck with the re&s;emblance, and
&s;colded after we came home&mdash;I am very
&s;en&s;ible of Jery's affection, and know he
&s;poke as well with a view to my own in|tere&s;t
and happine&s;s, as in regard to the
honour of the family; but I cannot bear
<PB N="61" REF="63">
to have my wounds probed &s;everely&mdash;I
was not &s;o much affected by the cen&s;ure
he pa&s;&s;ed upon my own indi&s;cretion, as
with the reflection he made on the con|duct
of Wil&s;on&mdash;He ob&s;erved, that if he
was really the gentleman he pretended to
be, and harboured nothing but honour|able
de&s;igns, he would have vindicated
his preten&s;ions in the face of day&mdash;This
remark made a deep impre&s;&s;ion upon my
mind&mdash;I endeavoured to conceal my
thoughts; and this endeavour had a bad
effect upon my health and &s;pirits; &s;o it
was thought nece&s;&s;ary that I &s;hould go to
the Highlands, and drink the goat-milk|whey.</P>
<P>We went accordingly to Lough-Lo|mond,
one of the mo&s;t enchanting &s;pots
in the whole world; and what with this
remedy, which I had every morning fre&s;h
from the mountains, and the pure air,
and chearful company, I have recovered
my fle&s;h and appetite; though there is
&s;omething &s;till at bottom, which it is not
in the power of air, exerci&s;e, company, or
medicine to remove&mdash;The&s;e incidents
would not touch me &s;o nearly, if I had a
&s;en&s;ible confidant to &s;ympathize with my
affliction, and comfort me with whole|$ome
advice&mdash;I have nothing of this kind,
<PB N="62" REF="64">
except Win Jenkins, who is really a good
body in the main, but very ill qualified
for &s;uch an office&mdash;The poor creature is
weak in her nerves, as well as in her un|der&s;tanding;
otherwi&s;e I might have
known the true name and character of
that unfortunate youth&mdash;But why do I
call him <HI>unfortunate?</HI> perhaps the epithet
is more applicable to me for having li&s;ten|ed
to the fal&s;e profe&s;&s;ions of&mdash;But,
hold! I have as yet no right, and &s;ure I
have no inclination to believe any thing
to the prejudice of his honour&mdash;In that
reflection I &s;hall &s;till exert my patience&mdash;
As for Mrs. Jenkins, &s;he her&s;elf is really
an object of compa&s;&s;ion&mdash;Between vani|ty,
methodi&s;m, and love, her head is al|mo&s;t
turned. I &s;hould have more regard
for her, however, if &s;he had been more
con&s;tant in the object of her affection;
but, truly, &s;he aimed at conque&s;t, and
flirted at the &s;ame time with my uncle's
footman, Humphry Clinker, who is re|ally
a de&s;erving young man, and one Dut|ton,
my brother's valet de chambre, a
debauched fellow; who, leaving Win in
the lurch, ran away with another man's
bride at Berwick.</P>
<P>My dear Willis, I am truly a&s;hamed of
my own &s;ex&mdash;We complain of advan|tages
<PB N="63" REF="65">

inexperience, &s;en&s;ibility, and all that;
but I have &s;een enough to believe, that
our &s;ex in general make it their bu&s;ine&s;s
to en&s;nare the other; and for this pur|po&s;e,
employ arts which are by no means
to be ju&s;tified&mdash;In point of con&s;tancy,
they certainly have nothing to reproach
the male part of the creation&mdash;My poor
aunt, without any regard to her years and
imperfections, has gone to market with
her charms in every place where &s;he
thought &s;he had the lea&s;t chance to di&s;|po&s;e
of her per&s;on, which, however,
hangs &s;till heavy on her hands&mdash;I am a|fraid
&s;he has u&s;ed even religion as a de|coy,
though it has not an&s;wered her ex|pectation&mdash;She
has been praying, preach|ing,
and catechi&s;ing among the metho|di&s;ts,
with whom this country abounds;
and pretends to have &s;uch manife&s;ta|tions
and revelations, as even Clinker
him&s;elf can hardly believe, though the
poor fellow is half crazy with enthu&s;ia&s;m.
As for Jenkins, &s;he affects to take all her
mi&s;tre&s;s's reveries for go&s;pel&mdash;She has al|&s;o
her heart-heavings and motions of the
&s;pirit; and God forgive me if I think un|charitably,
but all this &s;eems to me to
be downright hypocri&s;y and deceit&mdash;Per|haps,

is much &s;ubject to vapours&mdash;Since we

for &s;ome folks that we &s;caped drownding;
for mi&s;tre&s;s was very frexious, and &s;eem|ed

They &s;ay as how it has got n'er a bot|tom,

<LETTER>
<OPENER>To Sir WATKIN PHILLIPS, Bar^t. at
Oxon.
DEAR KNIHGT,</OPENER>
<P>ONCE more I tread upon Engli&s;h
ground, which I like not the wor&s;e for
the &s;ix weeks' ramble I have made among
the woods and mountains of Caledonia;
no offence to the <HI>land of cakes, where ban|nocks
grow upon &s;traw.</HI> I never &s;aw my
uncle in &s;uch health and &s;pirits as he
now enjoys. Liddy is perfectly recovered;
and Mrs. Tabitha has no rea&s;on to com|plain.
Neverthele&s;s, I believe, &s;he was,
till ye&s;terday, inclined to give the whole
Scotch nation to the devil, as a pack of
in&s;en&s;ible brutes, upon whom her accom|pli&s;hments
had been di&s;played in vain.&mdash;
At every place where we halted, did &s;he
<PB N="70" REF="72">
mount the &s;tage, and flouri&s;hed her ru&s;ty
arms, without being able to make one
conque&s;t. One of her la&s;t e&s;&s;ays was
again&s;t the heart of &s;ir George Colquhoun,
with whom &s;he fought all the weapons
more than twice over.&mdash;She was grave and
gay by turns&mdash;&s;he moralized and metho|dized&mdash;&s;he
laughed, and romped, and
danced, and &s;ung, and &s;ighed, and ogled,
and li&s;ped, and fluttered, and flattered&mdash;
but all was preaching to the de&s;art&mdash;The
baronet, being a well-bred man, carried
his civilities as far as &s;he could in con|&s;cience
expect, and, if evil tongues
are to be believed, &s;ome degrees farther;
but he was too much a veteran in gallan|try,
as well as in war, to fall into any
ambu&s;cade that &s;he could lay for his affec|tion.&mdash;While
we were ab&s;ent in the High|lands,
&s;he practi&s;ed al&s;o upon the laird
of Ladri&s;hmore, and even gave him the
rendezvous in the wood of Drum&s;cail|loch;
but the laird had &s;uch a reverend
care of his own reputation, that he came
attended with the par&s;on of the pari&s;h,
and nothing pa&s;&s;ed but &s;piritual commu|nication.&mdash;After
all the&s;e mi&s;carriages,
our aunt &s;uddenly recollected lieutenant
Li&s;mahago, whom, ever &s;ince our fir&s;t
arrival at Edinburgh, &s;he &s;eemed to have
<PB N="71" REF="73">
utterly forgot; but now &s;he expre&s;&s;ed
her hopes of &s;eeing him at Dumfries, ac|cording
to his promi&s;e.</P>
<P>We &s;et out from Gla&s;gow by the way
of Lanerk, the county-town of Clyde&s;|dale,
in the neighbourhood of which, the
whole river Clyde, ru&s;hing down a &s;teep
rock, forms a very noble and &s;tupendous
ca&s;cade. Next day we were obliged to
halt in a &s;mall borough, until the car|riage,
which had received &s;ome damage,
&s;hould be repaired; and here we met
with an incident which warmly in|tere&s;ted
the benevolent &s;pirit of Mr.
Bramble.&mdash;As we &s;tood at the window of
an inn that fronted the public pri&s;on, a
per&s;on arrived on hor&s;eback, genteelly,
tho' plainly, dre&s;&s;ed in a blue frock, with
his own hair cut &s;hort, and a gold-laced
hat upon his head.&mdash;Alighting, and giving
his hor&s;e to the landlord, he advanced to
an old man who was at work in paving
the &s;treet, and acco&s;ted him in the&s;e
words: &startq;This is hard work for &s;uch an
old man as you.&endq;&mdash;So &s;aying, he took
the in&s;trument out of his hand, and be|gan
to thump the pavement.&mdash;After a
few &s;trokes, &startq;Have you never a &s;on
(&s;aid he) to ea&s;e you of this labour?&endq;
&startq;Yes, an plea&s;e your honour, (replied
<PB N="72" REF="74">
the &s;enior) I have three hopeful lads,
but, at pre&s;ent, they are out of the
way.&endq; &startq;Honour not me (cried the
&s;tranger); it more becomes me to ho|nour
your grey hairs.&mdash;Where are
tho&s;e &s;ons you talk of?&endq; The ancient
paviour &s;aid, his elde&s;t &s;on was a captain
in the Ea&s;t-Indies; and the younge&s;t had
lately inli&s;ted as a &s;oldier, in hopes of
pro&s;pering like his brother. The gentle|man
de&s;iring to know what was become
of the &s;econd, he wiped his eyes, and
owned, he had taken upon him his old
father's debts, for which he was now in
the pri&s;on hard by.</P>
<P>The traveller made three quick &s;teps
towards the jail, then turning &s;hort,
&startq;Tell me, (&s;aid he) has that unnatural
captain &s;ent you nothing to relieve
your di&s;tre&s;&s;es?&endq; &startq;Call him not un|natural
(replied the other); God's
ble&s;&s;ing be upon him! he &s;ent me a
great deal of money; but I made a
bad u&s;e of it; I lo&s;t it by being &s;ecuri|ty
for a gentleman that was my land|lord,
and was &s;tript of all I had in the
world be&s;ides.&endq; At that in&s;tant a
young man, thru&s;ting out his head and
neck between two iron bars in the pri&s;on-window,
exclaimed, &startq;Father! father!
<PB N="73" REF="75">
if my brother William is in life, that's
he!&endq; &startq;I am!&mdash;I am!&mdash;(cried the
&s;tranger, cla&s;ping the old man in his
arms, and &s;hedding a flood of tears)&mdash;
I am your &s;on Willy, &s;ure enough!&endq;
Before the father, who was quite con|founded,
could make any return to this
tenderne&s;s, a decent old woman bolting
out from the door of a poor habitation,
cried, &startq;Where is my bairn? where is
my dear Willy?&endq;&mdash;The captain no
&s;ooner beheld her, than he quitted his fa|ther,
and ran into her embrace.</P>
<P>I can a&s;&s;ure you, my uncle, who &s;aw
and heard every thing that pa&s;&s;ed, was
as much moved as any one of the parties
concerned in this pathetic recognition.&mdash;
He &s;obbed, and wept, and clapped his
hands, and hollowed, and finally ran
down into the &s;treet. By this time, the
captain had retired with his parents, and
all the inhabitants of the place were a&s;&s;em|bled
at the door.&mdash;Mr. Bramble, never|thele&s;s,
pre&s;&s;ed thro' the crowd, and enter|ing
the hou&s;e, &startq;Captain, (&s;aid he) I beg
the favour of your acquaintance&mdash;I
would have travelled a hundred miles
to &s;ee this affecting &s;cene; and I &s;hall
think my&s;elf happy, if you and your
<PB N="74" REF="76">
parents will dine with me at the public
hou&s;e.&endq; The captain thanked him for
his kind invitation, which, he &s;aid, he
would accept with plea&s;ure; but, in the
mean time, he could not think of eating
or drinking, while his poor brother was in
trouble.&mdash;He forthwith depo&s;ited a &s;um
equal to the debt in the hands of the ma|gi&s;trate,
who ventured to &s;et his brother
at liberty without farther proce&s;s; and
then the whole family repaired to the inn
with my uncle, attended by the crowd,
the individuals of which &s;hook their
town&s;man by the hand, while he returned
their care&s;&s;es without the lea&s;t &s;ign of
pride or affectation.</P>
<P>This hone&s;t favourite of fortune, who&s;e
name was Brown, told my uncle, that he
had been bred a weaver, and, about eigh|teen
years ago, had, from a &s;pirit of
idlene&s;s and di&s;&s;ipation, enli&s;ted as a &s;ol|dier
in the &s;ervice of the Ea&s;t-India com|pany;
that, in the cour&s;e of duty, he had
the good fortune to attract the notice and
approbation of lord Clive, who preferred
him from one &s;tep to another, till he at|tained
the rank of captain and pay-ma&s;|ter
to the regiment, in which capacities
he had hone&s;tly ama&s;&s;ed above twelve
<PB N="75" REF="77">
thou&s;and pounds, and, at the peace, re|&s;igned
his commi&s;&s;ion.&mdash;He had &s;ent &s;e|veral
remittances to his father, who re|ceived
the fir&s;t only, con&s;i&s;ting of one
hundred pounds; the &s;econd had fallen
into the hands of a bankrupt; and the
third had been con&s;igned to a gentleman
of Scotland, who died before it arrived;
&s;o that it &s;till remained to be accounted
for by his executors. He now pre&s;ented
the old man with fifty pounds for his pre|&s;ent
occa&s;ions, over and above bank notes
for one hundred, which he had depo&s;ited
for his brother's relea&s;e.&mdash;He brought
along with him a deed ready executed,
by which he &s;ettled a perpetuity of four|&s;core
pounds upon his parents, to be in|herited
by their other two &s;ons after their
decea&s;e.&mdash;He promi&s;ed to purcha&s;e a
commi&s;&s;ion for his younge&s;t brother; to
take the other as his own partner in a
manufacture which he intended to &s;et up,
to give employment and bread to the in|du&s;trious;
and to give five hundred
pounds, by way of dower, to his &s;i&s;ter,
who had married a farmer in low circum|&s;tances.&mdash;Finally,
he gave fifty pounds
to the poor of the town where he was
born, and fea&s;ted all the inhabitants with|out
exception.</P>
<P><PB N="76" REF="78">
My uncle was &s;o charmed with the cha|racter
of captain Brown, that he drank
his health three times &s;ucce&s;&s;ively at din|ner.&mdash;He
&s;aid, he was proud of his ac|quaintance;
that he was an honour to
his country, and had in &s;ome mea&s;ure re|deemed
human nature from the reproach
of pride, &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s, and ingratitude.&mdash;
For my part, I was as much plea&s;ed with
the mode&s;ty as with the filial virtue of
this hone&s;t &s;oldier, who a&s;&s;umed no merit
from his &s;ucce&s;s, and &s;aid very little of
his own tran&s;actions, though the an&s;wers
he made to our inquiries were equally &s;en|&s;ible
and laconic. Mrs. Tabitha behaved
very graciou&s;ly to him until &s;he under|&s;tood
that he was going to make a tender
of his hand to a per&s;on of low e&s;tate, who
had been his &s;weet-heart while he worked
as a journeyman-weaver.&mdash;Our aunt was
no &s;ooner made acquainted with this de|&s;ign,
than &s;he &s;tarched up her behaviour
with a double proportion of re&s;erve; and
when the company broke up, &s;he ob&s;erv|ed,
with a to&s;s of her no&s;e, that Brown
was a civil fellow enough, con&s;idering
the lowne&s;s of his origin; but that For|tune,
though &s;he had mended his cir|cum&s;tances,
was incapable to rai&s;e his
<PB N="77" REF="79">
ideas, which were &s;till humble and ple|beian.</P>
<P>On the day that &s;ucceeded this adven|ture,
we went &s;ome miles out of our road
to &s;ee Drumlanrig, a &s;eat belonging to the
duke of Queen&s;berry, which appears like
a magnificent palace erected by magic,
in the mid&s;t of a wilderne&s;s.&mdash;It is indeed
a princely man&s;ion, with &s;uitable parks
and plantations, rendered &s;till more &s;trik|ing
by the nakedne&s;s of the &s;urrounding
country, which is one of the wilde&s;t tracts
in all Scotland.&mdash;This wildne&s;s, however,
is different from that of the Highlands; for
here the mountains, in&s;tead of heath, are
covered with a fine green &s;warth, afford|ing
pa&s;ture to innumerable flocks of &s;heep.
But the fleeces of this country, called
Nith&s;dale, are not comparable to the
wool of Galloway, which is &s;aid to equal
that of Sali&s;bury plain. Having pa&s;&s;ed
the night at the ca&s;tle of Drumlanrig, by
invitation from the duke him&s;elf, who is
one of the be&s;t men that ever breathed,
we pro&s;ecuted our journey to Dumfries, a
very elegant trading town near the bor|ders
of England, where we found plenty
of good provi&s;ion and excellent wine, at
very rea&s;onable prices, and the accommo|dation
<PB N="78" REF="80">
as good in all re&s;pects as in any
part of South-Britain.&mdash;If I was confined
to Scotland for life, I would chu&s;e Dum|fries
as the place of my re&s;idence. Here we
made enquiries about captain Li&s;mahago,
of whom hearing no tidings, we proceed|ed,
by the Solway Frith, to Carli&s;le. You
mu&s;t know, that the Solway &s;ands, upon
which travellers pa&s;s at low water, are ex|ceedingly
dangerous, becau&s;e, as the tide
makes, they become quick in different
places, and the flood ru&s;hes in &s;o impe|tuou&s;ly,
that pa&s;&s;engers are often over|taken
by the &s;ea, and peri&s;h.</P>
<P>In cro&s;&s;ing the&s;e treacherous Syrtes with
a guide, we perceived a drowned hor&s;e,
which Humphry Clinker, after due in|&s;pection,
declared to be the very identical
bea&s;t which Mr. Li&s;mahago rode when
he parted with us at Felton-bridge in Nor|thumberland.
This information, which
&s;eemed to intimate that our friend the
lieutenant had &s;hared the fate of his hor&s;e,
affected us all, and above all our aunt
Tabitha, who &s;hed &s;alt tears, and obliged
Clinker to pull a few hairs out of the
dead hor&s;e's tail, to be worn in a ring as
a remembrance of his ma&s;ter: but her
grief and ours was not of long duration;
<PB N="79" REF="81">
for one of the fir&s;t per&s;ons we &s;aw in Car|li&s;le,
was the lieutenant <HI>in propria per&s;$na,</HI>
bargaining with a hor&s;e-dealer for another
&s;teed, in the yard of the inn where we
alighted.&mdash;Mrs. Bramble was the fir&s;t
that perceived him, and &s;creamed as if &s;he
had &s;een a gho&s;t; and, truly, at a proper
time and place, he might very well have
pa&s;&s;ed for an inhabitant of another world;
for he was more meagre and grim than
before.&mdash;We received him the more cor|dially
for having &s;uppo&s;ed he had been
drowned; and he was not deficient in ex|pre&s;&s;ions
of &s;atisfaction at this meeting.&mdash;
He told us, he had enquired for us at
Dumfries, and been informed by a travel|ling
merchant from Gla&s;gow, that we
had re&s;olved to return by the way of
Cold&s;tream.&mdash;He &s;aid, that in pa&s;&s;ing the
&s;ands without a guide, his hor&s;e had
knocked up; and he him&s;elf mu&s;t have
peri&s;hed, if he had not been providential|ly
relieved by a return po&s;t-chai&s;e.&mdash;He
moreover gave us to under&s;tand, that his
&s;cheme of &s;ettling in his own country
having mi&s;carried, he was &s;o far on his
way to London, with a view to embark
for North-America, where he intended to
pa&s;s the re&s;t of his days among his old
<PB N="80" REF="82">
friends the Miamis, and amu&s;e him&s;elf in
fini&s;hing the education of the &s;on he had
by his beloved Squinkinacoo&s;ta.</P>
<P>This project was by no means agreeable
to our good aunt, who expatiated upon
the fatigues and dangers that would at|tend
&s;uch a long voyage by &s;ea, and after|wards
&s;uch a tedious journey by land&mdash;
She enlarged particularly on the ri&s;que he
would run, with re&s;pect to the concerns of
his precious &s;oul, among &s;avages who
had not yet received the glad tidings of
&s;alvation; and &s;he hinted that his aban|doning
Great-Britain might, perhaps,
prove fatal to the inclinations of &s;ome de|&s;erving
per&s;on, whom he was qualified to
make happy for life. My uncle, who is
really a Don Quixote in genero&s;ity, under|&s;tanding
that Li&s;mahago's real rea&s;on
for leaving Scotland was the impo&s;&s;ibility
of &s;ub&s;i&s;ting in it with any decency upon
the wretched provi&s;ion of a &s;ubaltern's
half-pay, began to be warmly intere&s;ted
on the &s;ide of compa&s;&s;ion.&mdash;He thought it
very hard, that a gentleman who had
&s;erved his country with honour, &s;hould be
driven by nece&s;&s;ity to &s;pend his old age,
among the refu&s;e of mankind, in &s;uch a
remote part of the world.&mdash;He di&s;cour&s;ed
<PB N="81" REF="83">
with me upon the &s;ubject; ob&s;erving,
that he would willingly offer the lieute|nant
an a&s;ylum at Brambleton-hall, if he
did not fore&s;ee that his &s;ingularities and
humour of contradiction would render
him an intolerable hou&s;e-mate, though his
conver&s;ation at &s;ome times might be both
in&s;tructive and entertaining: but, as
there &s;eemed to be &s;omething particular
in his attention to Mrs. Tabitha, he and I
agreed in opinion, that this intercour&s;e
&s;hould be encouraged, and improved, if
po&s;&s;ible, into a matrimonial union; in
which ca&s;e there would be a comfortable
provi&s;ion for both; and they might be
&s;ettled in a hou&s;e of their own, &s;o that
Mr. Bramble &s;hould have no more of their
company than he de&s;ired.</P>
<P>In pur&s;uance of this de&s;ign, Li&s;mahago
has been invited to pa&s;s the winter at
Brambleton-hall, as it will be time enough
to execute his American project in the
&s;pring.&mdash;He has taken time to con&s;ider of
this propo&s;al; mean while, he will keep
us company as far as we travel in the
road to Bri&s;tol, where he has hopes of
getting a pa&s;&s;age for America. I make no
doubt but that he will po&s;tpone his voy|age,
and pro&s;ecute his addre&s;&s;es to a hap|py
<PB N="82" REF="84">
con&s;ummation; and &s;ure, if it pro|duces
any fruit, it mu&s;t be of a very pe|culiar
flavour. As the weather continues
favourable, I believe, we &s;hall take the
Peak of Derby&s;hire and Buxton Wells in
our way.&mdash;At any rate, from the fir&s;t
place where we make any &s;tay, you &s;hall

<OPENER>To Dr. LEWIS.
DEAR DOCTOR,</OPENER>
<P>THE pea&s;antry of Scotland are cer|tainly
on a poor footing all over the king|dom;
and yet they look better, and are
better cloathed than tho&s;e of the &s;ame
rank in Burgundy, and many other places
of France and Italy; nay, I will venture
to &s;ay they are better fed, notwith&s;tand|ing
the boa&s;ted wine of the&s;e foreign
countries. The country people of North-Britain
live chiefly on oat-meal, and milk,
chee&s;e, butter, and &s;ome garden-&s;tuff,
with now and then a pickled-herring, by
way of delicacy; but fle&s;h-meat they &s;el|dom
or never ta&s;te; nor any kind of
&s;trong liquor, except two-penny, at times
of uncommon fe&s;tivity&mdash;Their breakfa&s;t
is a kind of ha&s;ty pudding, of oat-meal
or pea&s;e-meal, eaten with milk. They
have commonly pottage to dinner, com|po&s;ed
of cale or cole, leeks, barley or
<PB N="84" REF="86">
big, and butter; and this is reinforced
with bread and chee&s;e, made of &s;kimmed-milk&mdash;At
night they &s;up on &s;owens or
flummery of oat-meal&mdash;In a &s;carcity of
oats, they u&s;e the meal of barley and
pea&s;e, which is both nouri&s;hing and pa|latable.
Some of them have potatoes;
and you find par&s;nips in every pea&s;ant's
garden&mdash;They are cloathed with a coar&s;e
kind of ru&s;&s;et of their own making,
which is both decent and warm&mdash;They
dwell in poor huts, built of loo&s;e &s;tones
and turf, without any mortar, having a
fire-place or hearth in the middle, gene|rally
made of an old mill-&s;tone, and a
hole at top to let out the &s;moke.</P>
<P>The&s;e people, however, are content,
and wonderfully &s;agacious&mdash;All of them
read the Bible, and are even qualified to
di&s;pute upon the articles of their faith;
which, in tho&s;e parts I have &s;een, is en|tirely
Pre&s;byterian. I am told, that the
inhabitants of Aberdeen&s;hire are &s;till more
acute. I once knew a Scotch gentleman
at London, who had declared war again&s;t
this part of his countrymen; and &s;wore
that the impudence and knavery of the
Scots, in that quarter, had brought a re|proach
upon the whole nation.</P>
<P><PB N="85" REF="87">
The river Clyde, above Gla&s;gow, is
quite pa&s;toral; and the banks of it are
every where adorned with fine villas.
From the &s;ea to its &s;ource, we may reckon
the &s;eats of many families of the fir&s;t rank,
&s;uch as the duke of Argyle at Ro&s;eneath,
the earl of Bute in the i&s;le of that name,
the earl of Glencairn at Finlay&s;ton, lord
Blantyre at Are&s;kine, the dutche&s;s of
Douglas at Bothwell, duke Hamilton at
Hamilton, the duke of Douglas at
Douglas, and the earl of Hyndford at
Carmichael. Hamilton is a noble pa|lace,
magnificently furni&s;hed; and hard
by is the village of that name, one of the
neate&s;t little towns I have &s;een in any
country. The old ca&s;tle of Douglas be|ing
burned to the ground by accident,
the late duke re&s;olved, as head of the fir&s;t
family in Scotland, to have the large&s;t
hou&s;e in the kingdom, and ordered a
plan for this purpo&s;e; but there was only
one wing of it fini&s;hed when he died. It
is to be hoped that his nephew, who is
now in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his great fortune, will
complete the de&s;ign of his predece&s;&s;or&mdash;
Clyde&s;dale is in general populous and
rich, containing a great number of gen|tlemen,
who are independent in their for|tune;
but it produces more cattle than
<PB N="86" REF="88">
corn&mdash;This is al&s;o the ca&s;e with Twee|dale,
through part of which we pa&s;&s;ed,
and Nid&s;dale, which is generally rough,
wild, and mountainous&mdash;The&s;e hills are
covered with &s;heep; and this is the &s;mall
delicious mutton, &s;o much preferable to
that of the London-market. As their
feeding co&s;ts &s;o little, the &s;heep are not
killed till five years old, when their fle&s;h,
juices, and flavour, are in perfection;
but their fleeces are much damaged by
the tar, with which they are &s;meared to
pre&s;erve them from the rot in winter, dur|ing
which they run wild night and day,
and thou&s;ands are lo&s;t under huge

cannot contrive &s;ome means to &s;helter
this u&s;eful animal from the inclemencies

perpetual rains, which are more prejudi|cial

<P>On the little river Nid, is &s;ituated the
ca&s;tle of Drumlanrig, one of the noble&s;t
&s;eats in Great-Britain, belonging to the
duke of Queen&s;berry; one of tho&s;e few
noblemen who&s;e goodne&s;s of heart does
honour to human-nature&mdash;I &s;hall not pre|tend
to enter into a de&s;cription of this
palace, which is really an in&s;tance of the
<PB N="87" REF="89">
&s;ublime in magnificence, as well as in
&s;ituation, and puts one in mind of the
beautiful city of Palmyra, ri&s;ing like a
vi&s;ion in the mid&s;t of the wilderne&s;s.
His grace keeps open hou&s;e, and lives
with great &s;plendour&mdash;He did us the ho|nour
to receive us with great courte&s;y,
and detain us all night, together with a|bove
twenty other gue&s;ts, with all their
&s;ervants and hor&s;es, to a very con&s;idera|ble
number&mdash;The dutche&s;s was equally
gracious, and took our ladies under her
immediate protection. The longer I live,
I &s;ee more rea&s;on to believe that preju|dices
of education are never wholly era|dicated,
even when they are di&s;covered
to be erroneous and ab&s;urd. Such ha|bits
of thinking as intere&s;t the grand pa&s;|&s;ions,
cleave to the human heart in &s;uch
a manner, that though an effort of rea|&s;on
may force them from their hold for a
moment, this violence no &s;ooner cea&s;es,
than they re&s;ume their gra&s;p with an en|crea&s;ed
ela&s;ticity and adhe&s;ion.</P>
<P>I am led into this reflection, by what
pa&s;&s;ed at the duke's table after &s;upper.
The conver&s;ation turned upon the vulgar
notions of &s;pirits and omens, that prevail
among the commonalty of North-Britain,
and all the company agreed, that nothing
<PB N="88" REF="90">
could be more ridiculous. One gentle|man,
however, told a remarkable &s;tory
of him&s;elf, by way of &s;peculation&mdash;&startq;Be|ing
on a party of hunting in the North,
(&s;aid he) I re&s;olved to vi&s;it an old
friend, whom I had not &s;een for twen|ty
years&mdash;So long he had been retired
and &s;eque&s;tered from all his acquain|tance,
and lived in a moping melan|choly
way, much afflicted with low|ne&s;s
of &s;pirits, occa&s;ioned by the death
of his wife, whom he had loved with
uncommon affection. As he re&s;ided
in a remote part of the country, and
we were five gentlemen with as many
&s;ervants, we carried &s;ome provi&s;ion with
us from the next market town, le&s;t we
&s;hould find him unprepared for our re|ception.
The roads being bad, we
did not arrive at the hou&s;e till two
o'clock in the afternoon; and were a|greeably
&s;urpri&s;ed to find a very good
dinner ready in the kitchen, and the
cloth laid with &s;ix covers. My friend
him&s;elf appeared in his be&s;t apparel at
the gate, and received us with open
arms, telling me he had been expect|ing
us the&s;e two hours&mdash;A&s;toni&s;hed at
this declaration, I a&s;ked who had given
him intelligence of our coming? and
<PB N="89" REF="91">
he &s;miled without making any other
reply&mdash;However, pre&s;uming upon our
former intimacy, I afterwards in&s;i&s;ted
upon knowing; and he told me, very
gravely, he had &s;een me in a vi&s;ion of
the &s;econd &s;ight&mdash;Nay, he called in the
evidence of his &s;teward, who &s;olemnly
declared, that his ma&s;ter had the day
before appri&s;ed him of my coming,
with four other &s;trangers, and ordered
him to provide accordingly; in con&s;e|quence
of which intimation, he had
prepared the dinner which we were now
eating; and laid the covers according
to the number foretold.&endq; The incident
we all owned to be remarkable, and I en|deavoured
to account for it by natural
means. I ob&s;erved, that as the gentle|man
was of a vi&s;ionary turn, the ca&s;ual
idea, or remembrance of his old friend,
might &s;ugge&s;t tho&s;e circum&s;tances, which
accident had for once realized; but that
in all probability he had &s;een many vi|&s;ions
of the &s;ame kind, which were never
verified. None of the company directly
di&s;&s;ented from my opinion; but from the
objections that were hinted, I could plain|ly
perceive, that the majority were per|&s;uaded
there was &s;omething more extra|ordinary
in the ca&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="90" REF="92">
Another gentlemen of the company,
addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to me, &startq;Without all
doubt, (&s;aid he) a di&s;ea&s;ed imagina|tion
is very apt to produce vi&s;ions; but
we mu&s;t find &s;ome other method to ac|count
for &s;omething of this kind, that
happened within the&s;e eight days in my
neighbourhood&mdash;A gentleman of a
good family, who cannot be deemed a
vi&s;ionary in any &s;en&s;e of the word, was
near his own gate, in the twilight, vi|&s;ited
by his grandfather, who has been
dead the&s;e fifteen years&mdash;The &s;pectre
was mounted &s;eemingly on the very
hor&s;e he u&s;ed to ride, with an angry
and terrible countenance, and &s;aid
&s;omething, which his grand&s;on, in the
confu&s;ion of his fear, could not under|&s;tand.
But this was not all&mdash;He lifted
up a huge hor&s;e-whip, and applied it
with great violence to his back and
&s;houlders, on which I &s;aw the impre&s;|&s;ion
with my own eyes. The appari|tion
was afterwards &s;een by the &s;exton
of the pari&s;h, hovering about the tomb
where his body lies interred; as the
man declared to &s;everal per&s;ons in the
village, before he knew what had hap|pened
to the gentleman&mdash;Nay, he ac|tually
came to me as a ju&s;tice of the
<PB N="91" REF="93">
peace, in order to make oath of the&s;e
particulars, which, however, I declin|ed
admini&s;tering. As for the grand&s;on
of the defunct, he is a &s;ober, &s;en&s;ible,
worldly-minded fellow, too intent up|on
&s;chemes of intere&s;t to give into re|veries.
He would have willingly con|cealed
the affair; but he bawled out
in the fir&s;t tran&s;port of his fear, and,
running into the hou&s;e, expo&s;ed his
back and his &s;conce to the whole fami|ly;
&s;o that there was no denying it in
the &s;equel. It is now the common di&s;|cour&s;e
of the country, that this ap|pearance
and behaviour of the old
man's &s;pirit, portends &s;ome great cala|mity
to the family, and the good wo|man
has actually taken to her bed in
this apprehen&s;ion.&endq;</P>
<P>Though I did not pretend to explain
this my&s;tery, I &s;aid, I did not at all
doubt, but it would one day appear to be
a deception; and, in all probability, a
&s;cheme executed by &s;ome enemy of the
per&s;on who had &s;u&s;tained the a&s;&s;ault;
but &s;till the gentleman in&s;i&s;ted upon the
clearne&s;s of the evidence, and the concur|rence
of te&s;timony, by which two credi|t$ble
witne&s;&s;es, without any communica|tion
one with another, affirmed the ap|pearance
<PB N="92" REF="94">
of the &s;ame man, with who&s;e
per&s;on they were both well acquainted&mdash;
From Drumlanrig we pur&s;ued the cour&s;e
of the Nid to D$umfries, which &s;tands
&s;everal miles above the place where the
river falls into the &s;ea; and is, after Gla&s;|gow,
the hand&s;ome&s;t town I have &s;een in
Scotland&mdash;The inhabitants, indeed, &s;eem
to have propo&s;ed that city as their model;
not only in beautifying their town and re|gulating
its police, but al&s;o in pro&s;ecut|ing
their &s;chemes of commerce and ma|nufacture,
by which they are grown rich
and opulent.</P>
<P>We re-entered England, by the way
of Carli&s;le, where we accidentally met
with our friend Li&s;mahago, whom we had
in vain inquired after at Dumfries and
other places&mdash;It would &s;eem that the cap|tain,
like the prophets of old, is but lit|tle
honoured in his own country, which
he has now renounced for ever&mdash;He gave
me the following particulars of his vi&s;it
to his native &s;oil&mdash;In his way to the place
of his nativity, he learned that his ne|phew
had married the daughter of a
burgeois, who directed a weaving manu|facture,
and had gone into partner&s;hip
with his father-in-law: chagrined with
this information, he had arrived at the
<PB N="93" REF="95">
gate in the twilight, where he heard the
&s;ound of treddles in the great hall, which
had exa&s;perated him to &s;uch a degree,
that he had like to have lo&s;t his &s;en&s;es:
while he was thus tran&s;ported with indig|nation,
his nephew chanced to come
forth, when, being no longer ma&s;ter of
his pa&s;&s;ion, he cried, &startq;Degenerate ra&s;|cal!
you have made my father's hou&s;e
a den of thieves;&endq; and at the &s;ame time
cha&s;ti&s;ed him with his hor&s;e-whip; then,
riding round the adjoining village, he
had vi&s;ited the burying-ground of his an|ce&s;tors
by moon-light; and, having paid
his re&s;pects to their <HI>manes,</HI> travelled all
night to another part of the country&mdash;
Finding the head of his family in &s;uch a
di&s;graceful &s;ituation, all his own friends
dead or removed from the places of their
former re&s;idence, and the expence of
living encrea&s;ed to double of what it had
been, when he fir&s;t left his native coun|try,
he had bid it an eternal adieu, and
was determined to &s;eek for repo&s;e among
the fore&s;ts of America.</P>
<P>I was no longer at a lo&s;s to account for
the apparition, which had been de&s;cribed
at Drumlanrig; and when I repeated the
&s;tory to the lieutenant, he was much
plea&s;ed to think his re&s;entment had been
<PB N="94" REF="96">
&s;o much more effectual than he intended;
and he owned, he might at &s;uch an hour,
and in &s;uch an equipage, very well pa&s;s
for the gho&s;t of his father, whom he was
&s;aid greatly to re&s;emble&mdash;Between
friends, I fancy Li&s;mahago will find a re|treat
without going &s;o far as the wig|wams
of the Miamis. My &s;i&s;ter Tabby
is making continual advances to him, in
the way of affection; and, if I may tru&s;t to
appearances, the captain is di&s;po&s;ed to
take opportunity by the forelock. For
my part, I intend to encourage this cor|re&s;pondence,
and &s;hall be glad to &s;ee them
united&mdash;In that ca&s;e, we &s;hall find a way
to &s;ettle them comfortably in our own
neighbourhood. I, and my &s;ervants,
will get rid of a very trouble&s;ome and ty|rannic
gouvernante; and I &s;hall have the
benefit of Li&s;mahago's conver&s;ation,
without being obliged to take more of his
company than I de&s;ire; for though an
olla is a high-flavoured di&s;h, I could not
bear to dine upon it every day of my life.</P>
<P>I am much plea&s;ed with Manche&s;ter,
which is one of the mo&s;t agreeable and
flouri&s;hing towns in Great-Britain; and I
perceive that this is the place which hath
animated the &s;pirit, and &s;ugge&s;ted the chief
manufactures of Gla&s;gow. We propo&s;e
<PB N="95" REF="97">
to vi&s;it Chat&s;worth, the Peak, and Buxton,
from which la&s;t place we &s;hall proceed di|rectly
homewards, though by ea&s;y jour|nies.
If the &s;ea&s;on has been as favourable
in Wales as in the North, your harve&s;t is
happily fini&s;hed; and we have nothing
left to think of but our October, of
which let Barns be properly reminded.
You will find me much better in fle&s;h than
I was at our parting; and this &s;hort &s;epa|ration

<PB N="99" REF="101">
<OPENER>To Dr. LEWIS.
DEAR LEWIS,</OPENER>
<P>LISMAHAGO is more paradoxical than
ever.&mdash;The late gulp he had of his native
air, &s;eems to have blown fre&s;h &s;pirit into
all his polemical faculties. I congratulat|ed
him the other day on the pre&s;ent flou|ri&s;hing
&s;tate of his country, ob&s;erving
that the Scots were now in a fair way to
wipe off the national reproach of pover|ty,
and expre&s;&s;ing my &s;atisfaction at the
happy effects of the union, &s;o con&s;picu|ous
in the improvement of their agricul|ture,
commerce, manufactures, and man|ners&mdash;
The lieutenant, &s;crewing up his
features into a look of di&s;&s;ent and di&s;gu&s;t,
commented on my remarks to this effect&mdash;
&startq;Tho&s;e who reproach a nation for its po|verty,
when it is not owing to the
profligacy or vice of the people, de|&s;erve
no an&s;wer. The Lacedaemonians
were poorer than the Scots, when they
took the lead among all the free &s;tates
<PB N="100" REF="102">
of Greece, and were e&s;teemed above
them all for their valour and their vir|tue.
The mo&s;t re&s;pectable heroes of
ancient Rome, &s;uch as Fabricius, Cin|cinnatus,
and Regulus, were poorer
than the poore&s;t freeholder in Scotland;
and there are at this day individuals in
North-Britain, one of whom can pro|duce
more gold and &s;ilver than the
whole republic of Rome could rai&s;e at
tho&s;e times when her public virtue &s;hone
with unrivalled lu&s;tre; and poverty was
&s;o far from being a reproach, that it
added fre&s;h laurels to her fame, becau&s;e
it indicated a noble contempt of wealth,
which was proof again&s;t all the arts of
corruption&mdash;If poverty be a &s;ubject for
reproach, it follows that wealth is the
object of e&s;teem and veneration&mdash;In
that ca&s;e, there are Jews and others in
Am&s;terdam and London, enriched by
u&s;ury, peculation, and different &s;pe|cies
of fraud and extortion, who are
more e&s;timable than the mo&s;t virtuous
and illu&s;trious members of the com|munity.
An ab&s;urdity which no man
in his &s;en&s;es will offer to maintain.&mdash;
Riches are certainly no proof of me|rit:
nay they are often (if not mo&s;t
commonly) acquired by per&s;ons of &s;or|did
<PB N="101" REF="103">
minds and mean talents: nor do
they give any intrin&s;ic worth to the po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;or;
but, on the contrary, tend to
pervert his under&s;tanding, and render
his morals more depraved. But, grant|ing
that poverty were really matter of
reproach, it cannot be ju&s;tly imputed
to Scotland. No country is poor that
can &s;upply its inhabitants with the ne|ce&s;&s;aries
of life, and even afford arti|cles
for exportation. Scotland is rich
in natural advantages: it produces
every &s;pecies of provi&s;ion in abundance,
va&s;t herds of cattle and flocks of &s;heep,
with a great number of hor&s;es; pro|digious
quantities of wool and flax,
with plenty of cop&s;e wood, and in &s;ome
parts large fore&s;ts of timber. The
earth is &s;till more rich below than above
the &s;urface. It yields inexhau&s;tible
&s;tores of coal, free-&s;tone, marble, lead,
iron, copper, and &s;ilver, with &s;ome gold.
The &s;ea abounds with excellent fi&s;h,
and &s;alt to cure them for exportation;
and there are creeks and harbours round
the whole kingdom, for the conveni|ence
and &s;ecurity of navigation. The
face of the country di&s;plays a &s;urpri&s;ing
number of cities, towns, villas, and
villages, &s;warming with people; and
<PB N="102" REF="104">
there &s;eems to be no want of art, in|du&s;try,
government, and police: &s;uch
a kingdom can never be called poor, in
any &s;en&s;e of the word, though there
may be many others more powerful
and opulent. But the proper u&s;e of
tho&s;e advantages, and the pre&s;ent pro|&s;perity
of the Scots, you &s;eem to derive
from the union of the two kingdoms!&endq;</P>
<P>I &s;aid, I &s;uppo&s;ed he would not deny
that the appearance of the country was
much mended; that the people lived bet|ter,
had more trade, and a greater quan|tity
of money circulating &s;ince the union,
than before. &startq;I may &s;afely admit the&s;e
premi&s;es, (an&s;wered the lieutenant)
without &s;ub&s;cribing to your inference.
The difference you mention, I &s;hould
take to be the natural progre&s;s of
improvement&mdash;Since that period, other
nations, &s;uch as the Swedes, the
Danes, and in particular the French,
have greatly increa&s;ed in commerce,
without any &s;uch cau&s;e a&s;&s;igned. Be|fore
the union, there was a remarkable
&s;pirit of trade among the Scots, as ap|peared
in the ca&s;e of their Darien com|pany,
in which they had embarked no
le&s;s than four hundred thou&s;and pounds
&s;terling; and in the flouri&s;hing &s;tate of
<PB N="103" REF="105">
the maritime towns in Fife, and on the
ea&s;tern coa&s;t, enriched by their trade
with France, which failed in con&s;e|quence
of the union. The only &s;olid
commercial advantage reaped from that
mea&s;ure, was the privilege of trading
to the Engli&s;h plantations; yet, ex|cepting
Gla&s;gow and Dumfries, I don't
know any other Scotch towns concern|ed
in that traffick. In other re&s;pects,
I conceive the Scots were lo&s;ers by the
union.&mdash;They lo&s;t the independency of
their &s;tate, the greate&s;t prop of nation|al
&s;pirit; they lo&s;t their parliament, and
their courts of ju&s;tice were &s;ubjected
to the revi&s;ion and &s;upremacy of an
Engli&s;h tribunal.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Softly, captain, (cried I) you can|not
be &s;aid to have lo&s;t your own par|liament,
while you are repre&s;ented in
that of Great-Britain.&endq; &startq;True, (&s;aid
he, with a &s;arca&s;tic grin) in debates of
national competition, the &s;ixteen peers
and forty-five commoners of Scotland,
mu&s;t make a formidable figure in the
&s;cale, again&s;t the whole Engli&s;h legi&s;|lature.&endq;
&startq;Be that as it may, (I ob|&s;erved)
while I had the honour to &s;it in
the lower hou&s;e, the Scotch members
had always the majority on their &s;ide.&endq;
&startq;I under&s;tand you, Sir, (&s;aid he) they
<PB N="104" REF="106">
generally &s;ide with the majority; &s;o
much the wor&s;e for their con&s;tituents.
But even this evil is not the wor&s;t they
have &s;u&s;tained by the union. Their
trade has been &s;addled with grievous
impo&s;itions, and every article of living
&s;everely taxed, to pay the intere&s;t of
enormous debts, contracted by the
Engli&s;h, in &s;upport of mea&s;ures and
connections in which the Scots had no
intere&s;t nor concern.&endq; I begged he
would at lea&s;t allow, that by the union
the Scots were admitted to all the privi|leges
and immunities of Engli&s;h &s;ub|jects;
by which means multitudes of them
were provided for in the army and navy,
and got fortunes in different parts of Eng|land,
and its dominions. &startq;All the&s;e,

all intents and purpo&s;es, and are in a
great mea&s;ure lo&s;t to their mother-coun|try.
The &s;pirit of rambling and adventure
has been always peculiar to the natives of
Scotland. If they had not met with en|couragement
in England, they would
have &s;erved and &s;ettled, as formerly, in
other countries, &s;uch as Mu&s;covy,
Sweden, Denmark, Poland, Germany,
France, Piedmont, and Italy, in all
which nations their de&s;cendents conti|nue

<P><PB N="105" REF="107">
By this time my patience began to fail,
and I exclaimed, &startq;For God's &s;ake, what
has England got by this union which,
you &s;ay, has been &s;o productive of mi&s;|fortune
to the Scots.&endq; &startq;Great and mani|fold
are the advantages which England
derives from the union (&s;aid Li&s;maha|go,
in a &s;olemn tone.) Fir&s;t and fore|mo&s;t,
the &s;ettlement of the prote&s;tant
&s;ucce&s;&s;ion, a point which the Engli&s;h
mini&s;try drove with &s;uch eagerne&s;s, that
no &s;tone was left unturned, to cajole and
bribe a few leading men, to cram the
union down the throats of the Scotti&s;h
nation, who were &s;urpri&s;ingly rever&s;e to
the expedient. They gained by it a
con&s;iderable addition of territory, ex|tending
their dominion to the &s;ea on
all &s;ides of the i&s;land, thereby &s;hutting
up all back-doors again&s;t the enterprizes
of their enemies. They got an ac|ce&s;&s;ion
of above a million of u&s;eful
&s;ubjects, con&s;tituting a never-failing
nur&s;ery of &s;eamen, &s;oldiers, labourers,
and mechanics; a mo&s;t valuable acqui|&s;ition
to a trading country, expo&s;ed to
foreign wars, and obliged to maintain
a number of &s;ettlements in all the four
quarters of the globe. In the cour&s;e
of &s;even years, during the la&s;t war, Scot|land
<PB N="106" REF="108">
furni&s;hed the Engli&s;h army and
navy with &s;eventy thou&s;and men, over
and above tho&s;e who migrated to their
colonies, or mingled with them at home in
the civil departments of life. This was a
very con&s;iderable and &s;ea&s;onable &s;upply
to a nation, who&s;e people had been for
many years decrea&s;ing in number, and
who&s;e lands and manufactures were ac|tually
&s;uffering for want of hands. I
need not remind you of the hackneyed
maxim, that, to a nation in &s;uch circum|&s;tances,
a &s;upply of indu&s;trious people
is a &s;upply of wealth; nor repeat an
ob&s;ervation, which is now received as an
eternal truth, even among the Engli&s;h
them&s;elves, that the Scots who &s;ettle in
South Britain are remarkably &s;ober,
orderly, and indu&s;trious.&endq;</P>
<P>I allowed the truth of this remark, add|ing,
that by their indu&s;try, oeconomy,
and circum&s;pection, many of them in
England, as well as in her colonies,
ama&s;&s;ed large fortunes, with which they
returned to their own country, and this
was &s;o much lo&s;t to South-Britain.&mdash;
&startq;Give me leave, &s;ir, (&s;aid he) to a&s;&s;ure
you, that in your fact you are mi&s;taken,
and in your deduction, erroneous.&mdash;
Not one in two hundred that leave
<PB N="107" REF="109">
Scotland ever returns to &s;ettle in his
own country; and the few that do re|turn,
carry thither nothing that can
po&s;&s;ibly dimini&s;h the &s;tock of South-|Britain;
for none of their trea&s;ure &s;tag|nates
in Scotland&mdash;There is a continual
circulation, like that of the blood in
the human body, and England is the
heart, to which all the &s;treams which it
di&s;tributes are refunded and returned:
nay, in con&s;equence of that luxury
which our connexion with England hath
greatly encouraged, if not introduced,
all the produce of our lands&punc; and all
the profits of our trade, are engro&s;&s;ed
by the natives of South Britain; for
you will find that the exchange be|tween
the two kingdoms is always
again&s;t Scotland; and that &s;he retains
neither gold nor &s;ilver &s;ufficient for her
own circulation.&mdash;The Scots, not con|tent
with their own manufactures and
produce, which would very well an|&s;wer
all nece&s;&s;ary occa&s;ions, &s;eem to
vie with each other in purcha&s;ing &s;uper|fluities
from England; &s;uch as broad|cloth,
velvets, &s;tuffs, &s;ilks, lace, furs,
jewels, furniture of all &s;orts, &s;ugar,
rum, tea, chocolate, and coffee; in a
word, not only every mode of the
<PB N="108" REF="110">
mo&s;t extravagant luxury, but even
many articles of convenience, which
they might find as good, and much
cheaper in their own country. For all
the&s;e particulars, I conceive, England
may touch about one million &s;ter|ling
a-year.&mdash;I don't pretend to make
an exact calculation; perhaps, it may
be &s;omething le&s;s, and, perhaps, a
great deal more.&mdash;The annual revenue
ari&s;ing from all the private e&s;tates of
Scotland cannot fall &s;hort of a million
&s;terling; and, I &s;hould imagine, their
trade will amount to as much more.&mdash;
I know, the linen manufacture alone
returns near half a million, exclu&s;ive
of the home-con&s;umption of that arti|cle.&mdash;
If, therefore, North-Britain pays
a balance of a million annually to Eng|land,
I in&s;i&s;t upon it, that country is
more valuable to her in the way of
commerce, than any colony in her po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion,
over and above the other advan|tages
which I have &s;pecified: therefore,
they are no friends, either to England
or to truth, who affect to depreciate the
northern part of the united kingdom.&endq;</P>
<P>I mu&s;t own, I was at fir&s;t a little net|tled
to find my&s;elf &s;chooled in &s;o many
particulars.&mdash;Though I did not receive
<PB N="109" REF="111">
all his a&s;&s;ertions as go&s;pel, I was not pre|pared
to refute them; and I cannot help
now acquie&s;cing in his remarks &s;o far as
to think, that the contempt for Scotland,
which prevails too much on this &s;ide the
Tweed, is founded on prejudice and er|ror.&mdash;
After &s;ome recollection, &startq;Well,
captain, (&s;aid I) you have argued
&s;toutly for the importance of your own
country: for my part, I have &s;uch a
regard for our fellow-&s;ubjects of North-Britain,
that I &s;hall be glad to &s;ee the
day, when your pea&s;ants can afford to
give all their oats to their cattle, hogs,
and poultry, and indulge them&s;elves
with good wheaten loaves, in&s;tead of
&s;uch poor, unpalatable, and inflamma|tory
diet.&endq; Here again I brought my|&s;elf
into a premunire with the di&s;puta|ceous
Caledonian. He &s;aid, he hoped
he &s;hould never &s;ee the common people
lifted out of that &s;phere for which they
were intended by nature and the cour&s;e of
things; that they might have &s;ome rea&s;on
to complain of their bread, if it were mix|ed,
like that of Norway, with &s;aw-du&s;t
and fi&s;h-bones; but that oatmeal was, he
apprehended, as nouri&s;hing and &s;alutary
as wheat-flour, and the Scots in general
thought it at lea&s;t as &s;avoury.&mdash;He affirmed,
<PB N="110" REF="112">
that a mou&s;e, which, in the article of
&s;elf-pre&s;ervation, might be &s;uppo&s;ed to
act from infallible in&s;tinct, would always
prefer oats to wheat, as appeared from ex|perience;
for, in a place where there was
a parcel of each, that animal had never
begun to feed upon the latter till all
the oats were con&s;umed: for their nutri|tive
quality, he appealed to the hale, ro|bu&s;t
con&s;titutions of the people who lived
chiefly upon oatmeal; and, in&s;tead of
being inflammatory, he a&s;&s;erted, that it
was a cooling &s;ub-acid, bal&s;amic and
mucilaginous; in&s;omuch, that in all in|flammatory
di&s;tempers, recour&s;e was had
to water-gruel, and flummery made of
oa$meal.</P>
<P>&startq;At lea&s;t, (&s;aid I) give me leave to
wi&s;h them &s;uch a degree of commerce
as may enable them to follow their own
inclinations.&endq;&mdash;&startq;Heaven forbid!
(cried this philo&s;opher) Woe be to
that nation, where the multitude is
at liberty to follow their own inclina|tions!
Commerce is undoubtedly a
ble&s;&s;ing, while re&s;trained within its pro|per
channels; but a glut of wealth
brings along with it a glut of evils:
it brings fal&s;e ta&s;te, fal&s;e appetite,
fal&s;e wants, profu&s;ion, venality, con|tempt
<PB N="111" REF="113">
of order, engendering a &s;pirit of
licentiou&s;ne&s;s, in&s;olence, and faction,
that keeps the community in continual
ferment, and in time de&s;troys all the
di&s;tinctions of civil &s;ociety; &s;o that
univer&s;al anarchy and uproar mu&s;t en|&s;ue.
Will any &s;en&s;ible man affirm,
that the national advantages of opu|lence
are to be &s;ought on the&s;e terms?&endq;
&startq;No, &s;ure; but I am one of tho&s;e who
think, that, by proper regulations, com|merce
may produce every national bene|fit,
without the allay of &s;uch concomi|tant
evils.&endq;</P>
<P>So much for the dogmata of my friend
Li&s;mahago, whom I de&s;cribe the more
circum&s;tantially, as I firmly believe he
will &s;et up his re&s;t in Monmouth&s;hire.
Ye&s;terday, while I was alone with him,
he a&s;ked, in &s;ome confu&s;ion, if I &s;hould

and a &s;oldier, provided he &s;hould

I an&s;wered, without he&s;itation,
that my &s;i&s;ter was old enough to judge for
her&s;elf; and that I &s;hould be very far
from di&s;approving any re&s;olution &s;he
might take in his favour.&mdash;His eyes
&s;parkled at this declaration. He de|clared,
he &s;hould think him&s;elf the hap|pie&s;t
<PB N="112" REF="114">
man on earth to be connected with
my family; and that he &s;hould never be

<OPENER>To Sir WATKIN PHILLIPS, Bar^t. at

DEAR WAT,</OPENER>
<P>ADVENTURES begin to thicken as
we advance to the &s;outhward.&mdash;Li&s;maha|go
has now profe&s;&s;ed him&s;elf the admirer
of our aunt, and carries on his addre&s;&s;es
under the &s;anction of her brother's appro|bation;
&s;o that we &s;hall certainly have a
wedding by Chri&s;tmas. I &s;hould be glad
you was pre&s;ent at the nuptials, to help
me to throw the &s;tocking, and perform
other ceremonies peculiar to that occa|&s;ion&mdash;
I am &s;ure it will be productive
of &s;ome diver&s;ion; and, truly, it would
be worth your while to come acro&s;s
the country on purpo&s;e to &s;ee two &s;uch ori|ginal
figures in bed together, with their
laced night-caps; he, the emblem of good
chear, and &s;he, the picture of good na|ture.
All this agreeable pro&s;pect was
clouded, and had well nigh vani&s;hed en|tirely,
<PB N="114" REF="116">
in con&s;equence of a late mi&s;under|&s;tanding
between the future brothers-in-|law,
which, however, is now happily
removed.</P>
<P>A few days ago, my uncle and I, going
to vi&s;it a relation, met with lord Oxming|ton
at his hou&s;e, who a&s;ked us to dine
with him next day, and we accepted the
invitation.&mdash;Accordingly, leaving our
women under the care of captain Li&s;ma|hago,
at the inn where we had lodged the
preceding night, in a little town, about a
mile from his lord&s;hip's dwelling, we
went at the hour appointed, and had a
fa&s;hionable meal &s;erved up with much
o&s;tentation to a company of about a dozen
per&s;ons, none of whom we had ever &s;een
before.&mdash;His lord&s;hip is much more re|markable
for his pride and caprice, than
for his ho&s;pitality and under&s;tanding;
and, indeed, it appeared, that he con|&s;idered
his gue&s;ts merely as objects to
&s;hine upon, &s;o as to reflect the lu&s;tre of
his own magnificence.&mdash;There was much
&s;tate, but no courte&s;y; and a great deal of
compliment without any conver&s;ation.&mdash;
Before the de&s;ert was removed, our noble
entertainer propo&s;ed three general toa&s;ts;
then calling for a gla&s;s of wine, and
bowing all round, wi&s;hed us a good af|ternoon.
<PB N="115" REF="117">
This was the &s;ignal for the
company to break up, and they obeyed
it immediately, all except our '&s;quire, who
was greatly &s;hocked at the manner of this
di&s;mi&s;&s;ion.&mdash;He changed coutenance, bit
his lip in &s;ilence, but &s;till kept his &s;eat,
&s;o that his lord&s;hip found him&s;elf obliged
to give us another hint, by &s;aying, he
&s;hould be glad to &s;ee us another time.
&startq;There is no time like the time pre&s;ent
(cried Mr. Bramble); your lord&s;hip has
not yet drank a bumper to <HI>the be&s;t in
Chri&s;tendom.</HI>&endq; &startq;I'll drink no more bum|pers
to-day (an&s;wered our landlord);
and I am &s;orry to &s;ee you have drank too
many.&mdash;Order the gentleman's carriage
to the gate.&endq;&mdash;So &s;aying, he ro&s;e and
retired abruptly; our '&s;quire &s;tarting up
at the &s;ame time, laying his hand upon
his &s;word, and eying him with a mo&s;t fe|rocious
a&s;pect. The ma&s;ter having vani&s;h|ed
in this manner, our uncle bad one of
the &s;ervants to &s;ee what was to pay; and
the fellow an&s;wering, &startq;This is no inn,&endq;
&startq;I cry you mercy, (cried the other) I
perceive it is not; if it were, the land|lord
would be more civil.&mdash;There's a
guinea, however; take it, and tell
your lord, that I &s;hall not leave the
country till I have had an opportunity

<PB N="118" REF="118">
the rage of his indignation, that he mi&s;|took
its object.&mdash;He wanted to quarrel
with Mr. Bramble; he &s;aid, he had been
di&s;honoured on his account, and he look|ed
for reparation at his hands.&mdash;My un|cle's
back was up in a moment; and he
de&s;ired him to explain his preten&s;ions.&mdash;
&startq;Either compel lord Oxmington to give
me &s;atisfaction, (cried he) or give it me
in your own per&s;on.&endq; &startq;The latter
part of the alternative is the mo&s;t ea&s;y
and expeditious (replied the '&s;quire,
&s;tarting up): if you are di&s;po&s;ed for a
walk, I'll attend you this moment.&endq;</P>
<P>Here they were interrupted by Mrs.
Tabby, who had overheard all that
pa&s;&s;ed.&mdash;She now bur&s;t into the room,
and running betwixt them, in great agi|tation,
&startq;Is this your regard for me, (&s;aid
&s;he to the lieutenant) to &s;eek the life of
my brother?&endq; Li&s;mahago, who &s;eem|ed
to grow cool as my uncle grew hot,
a&s;&s;ured her he had a very great re&s;pect
for Mr. Bramble, but he had &s;till more
for his own honour, which had &s;uffered
pollution; but if that could be once pu|rified,
he &s;hould have no further cau&s;e of
di&s;&s;atisfaction.&mdash;The '&s;quire &s;aid, he
&s;hould have thought it incumbent upon
him to vindicate the lieutenant's honour;
<PB N="119" REF="119">
but, as he had now carved for him&s;elf, he
might &s;wallow and dige&s;t it as well
as he could.&mdash;In a word, what
betwixt the mediation of Mrs. Tabitha,
the recollection of the captain, who per|ceived
he had gone too far, and the re|mon&s;trances
of your humble &s;ervant, who
joined them at this juncture, tho&s;e two
originals were perfectly reconciled; and
then we proceeded to deliberate upon the
means of taking vengeance for the in&s;ults
they had received from the petulant peer;
for, until that aim &s;hould be accompli&s;h|ed,
Mr. Bramble &s;wore, with great em|pha&s;is,
that he would not leave the inn
where we now lodged, even if he &s;hould
pa&s;s his Chri&s;tmas on the &s;port.</P>
<P>In con&s;equence of our deliberations, we
next day, in the forenoon, proceeded in a
body to his lord&s;hip's hou&s;e, all of us,
with our &s;ervants, including the coach|man,
mounted a-hor&s;eback, with our
pi&s;tols loaded and ready primed.&mdash;Thus
prepared for action, we paraded &s;olemnly
and &s;lowly before his lord&s;hip's gate, which
we pa&s;&s;ed three times in &s;uch a manner, that
he could not but &s;ee us, and &s;u&s;pect the
cau&s;e of our appearance.&mdash;After dinner
we returned, and performed the &s;ame ca|valcade,
which was again repeated the
<PB N="120" REF="120">
morning following; but we had no oc|ca&s;ion
to per&s;i&s;t in the&s;e manoeuvres.&mdash;
About noon, we were vi&s;ited by the gen|tleman,
at who&s;e hou&s;e we had fir&s;t &s;een
lord Oxmington.&mdash;He now came to make
apologies in the name of his lord&s;hip, who
declared he had no intention to give of|fence
to my uncle, in practi&s;ing what
had been always the cu&s;tom of his hou&s;e;
and that as for the indignities which had
been put upon the officer, they were of|fered
without his lord&s;hip's knowledge,
at the in&s;tigation of his valet de chambre.
&mdash;&startq;If that be the ca&s;e, (&s;aid my uncle, in
a peremptory tone) I &s;hall be contented
with lord Oxmington's per&s;onal ex|cu&s;es;
and I hope my friend will be
&s;atisfied with his lord&s;hip's turning
that in&s;olent ra&s;cal out of his &s;ervice.&endq;

upon taking per&s;onal vengeance for
the per&s;onal injuries I have &s;u&s;tained.&endq;</P>
<P>After &s;ome debate, the affair was ad|ju&s;ted
in this manner.&mdash;His lord&s;hip,
meeting us at our friend's hou&s;e, declar|ed
he was &s;orry for what had happened;
and that he had no intention to give um|brage.&mdash;
The valet de chambre a&s;ked par|don
of the lieutenant upon his knees,
when Li&s;mahago, to the a&s;toni&s;hment of
<PB N="121" REF="121">
all pre&s;ent, gave him a violent kick on
the face, which laid him on his back, ex|claiming
in a furious tone, &startq;<HI>Oui je te
pardonne, gens foutre.</HI>&endq;</P>
<P>Such was the fortunate i&s;&s;ue of this pe|rilous
and adventure, which threatened abun|dance
of vexation to our family; for the
'&s;quire is one of tho&s;e who will &s;acrifice
both life and fortune, rather than leave
what they conceive to be the lea&s;t &s;pe$k
or blemi&s;h upon their honour and reputa|tion.
His lord&s;hip had no &s;ooner pro|nounced
his apology, with a very bad
grace, than he went away in &s;ome di&s;or|der,
and, I dare &s;ay, he will never invite
another Welchman to his table.</P>
<P>We forthwith quitted the field of this
atchievement, in order to pro&s;ecute our

DEAR DICK,</OPENER>
<P>AT what time of life may a man think
him&s;elf exempted from the nece&s;&s;ity of
&s;acrificing his repo&s;e to the puctilios of a
contemptible world? I have been engag|ed
in a ridiculous adventure, which I &s;hall

will not be much longer delayed, as we
have now performed almo&s;t all our vi&s;its,
and &s;een every thing that I think has
any right to retard us in our journey
homewards&mdash;A few days ago, under|&s;tanding
by accident, that my old friend
Baynard was in the country, I would not
pa&s;s &s;o near his habitation without pay|ing
him a vi&s;it, though our corre&s;pon|dence
had been interrupted for a long
cour&s;e of years.</P>
<P>I felt my&s;elf very &s;en&s;ibly affected by
the ideas of our pa&s;t intimacy, as we ap|proached
the place where we had &s;pent &s;o
many happy days together; but when we

arrived at the hou&s;e, I could not recog|nize
any one of tho&s;e objects, which had
been &s;o deeply impre&s;&s;ed upon my re|membrance&mdash;
The tall oaks that &s;haded
the avenue, had been cut down, and the
iron gates at the end of it removed, toge|ther
with the high wall that &s;urrounded the
court yard. The hou&s;e it&s;elf, which was
formerly a convent of Ci&s;tercian monks,
had a venerable appearance; and along
the front that looked into the garden, was
a &s;tone gallery, which afforded me many
an agreeable walk, when I was di&s;po&s;ed
to be contemplative&mdash;Now the old front
is covered with a &s;creen of modern archi|tecture;
&s;o that all without is Grecian,
and all within Gothic&mdash;As for the garden,
which was well &s;tocked with the be&s;t fruit
which England could produce, there is
not now the lea&s;t ve&s;tage remaining of
trees, walls, or hedges&mdash;Nothing ap|pears
but a naked circus of loo&s;e &s;and,
with a dry ba&s;on and a leaden triton in
the middle.</P>
<P>You mu&s;t know, that Baynard, at his
father's death, had a clear e&s;tate of fifteen
hundred pounds a-year, and was in other
re&s;pects extremely well qualified to make
a re&s;pectable figure in the common|wealth;
but, what with &s;ome exce&s;&s;es of
<PB N="124" REF="124">
youth, and the expence of a conte&s;ted e|lection,
he in a few years found him&s;elf
encumbered with a debt of ten thou&s;and
pounds, which he re&s;olved to di&s;charge
by means of a prudent marriage&mdash;He ac|cordingly
married a m$&s; Thom&s;on, who&s;e
fortune amounted to double the &s;um that
he owed&mdash;She was the daughter of a ci|tizen,
who had failed in trade; but her
fortune came by an uncle, who died in
the Ea&s;t-Indies&mdash;Her own parents being
dead, &s;he lived with a maiden aunt, who
had &s;uperintended her education; and, in
all appearance, was well enough qualifi|ed
for the u&s;ual purpo&s;es of the married
&s;tate&mdash;Her virtues, however, &s;tood ra|ther
upon a negative, than a po&s;itive foun|dation&mdash;
She was neither proud, in&s;olent,
nor capricious, nor given to &s;candal, nor
addicted to gaming, nor inclined to gal|lantry&mdash;
She could read, and write, and
dance, and &s;ing, and play upon the harp|&s;ichord,
and &s;matter French, and take a
hand at whi&s;t and ombre; but even the&s;e
accompli&s;hments &s;he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by halves
&mdash;She excelled in nothing. Her conver|&s;ation
was fla$, her &s;tile mean, and her
expre&s;&s;ion embarra&s;&s;ed&mdash;In a word, her
character was totally in&s;ipid. Her per|&s;on
was not di&s;agreeable; but there was
<PB N="125" REF="125">
nothing graceful in her addre&s;s, nor en|gaging
in her manners; and &s;he was &s;o
ill qualified to do the honours of the
hou&s;e, that when &s;he &s;at at the head of
the table, one was always looking for
the mi&s;tre&s;s of the family in &s;ome other
place.</P>
<P>Baynard had flattered him&s;elf, that it
would be no difficult matter to mould
&s;uch a &s;ubject after his own fa&s;hion, and
that &s;he would chearfully enter into his
views, which were wholly turned to do|me&s;tic
happine&s;s. He propo&s;ed to re&s;ide
always in the country, of which he was
fond to a degree of enthu&s;ia&s;m, to cul|tivate
his e&s;tate, which was very improv|able;
to enjoy the exerci&s;e of rural di|ver&s;ions;
to maintain an intimacy of cor|re&s;pondence
with &s;ome friends that were
&s;ettled in his neighbourhood; to keep a
comfortable hou&s;e, without &s;uffering his
expence to exceed the limits of his in|come;
and to find plea&s;ure and employ|ment
for his wife in the management and
avocations of her own family&mdash;This,
however, was a vi&s;ionary &s;cheme, which
he never was able to realize. His wife
was as ignorant as a new-born babe of
every thing that related to the conduct of
a family; and &s;he had no idea of a coun|try
<PB N="126" REF="126">
life&mdash;Her under&s;tanding did not reach
&s;o far as to comprehend the fir&s;t princi|ples
of di&s;cretion; and, indeed, if her
capacity had been better than it was, her
natural indolence would not have permit|ted
her to abandon a certain routine, to
which &s;he had been habituated. She had
not ta&s;te enough to reli&s;h any rational en|joyment;
but her ruling pa&s;&s;ion was va|nity,
not that &s;pecies which ari&s;es from
&s;elf-conceit of &s;uperior accompli&s;hments,
but that which is of a ba&s;tard and idiot
nature, excited by &s;hew and o&s;tentation,
which implies not even the lea&s;t con&s;ci|ou&s;ne&s;s
of any per&s;onal merit.</P>
<P>The nuptial peal of noi&s;e and non&s;en&s;e
being rung out in all the u&s;ual changes,
Mr. Baynard thought it high time to make
her acquainted with the particulars of the
plan which he had projected&mdash;He told
her that his fortune, though &s;ufficient to
afford all the comforts of life, was not
ample enough to command all the &s;uper|fluities
of pomp and pageantry, which,
indeed, were equally ab&s;urd and intolera|ble&mdash;
He therefore hoped &s;he would have
no objection to their leaving London in
the &s;pring, when he would take the op|portunity
to di&s;mi&s;s &s;ome unnece&s;&s;ary do|me&s;tics,
<PB N="127" REF="127">
whom he had hired for the occa|&s;ion
of their marriage&mdash;She heard him in
&s;ilence, and after &s;ome pau&s;e, &startq;So, (&s;aid
&s;he) I am to be buried in the country!&endq;
He was &s;o confounded at this reply, that
he could not &s;peak for &s;ome minutes: at
length he told her, he was much morti|fied
to find he had propo&s;ed any thing
that was di&s;agreeable to her ideas&mdash;&startq;I
am &s;ure (added he) I meant nothing
more than to lay down a comfortable
plan of living within the bounds of our
fortune, which is but moderate.&endq;
&startq;Sir, (&s;aid &s;he) you are the be&s;t judge
of your own affairs&mdash;My fortune, I
know, does not exceed twenty thou|&s;and
pounds&mdash;Yet, even with that
pittance, I might have had a hu&s;band
who would not have begrudged me a
hou&s;e in London&mdash;&endq; &startq;Good God!
my dear, (cried poor Baynard, in the
utmo&s;t agitation) you don't think me
&s;o &s;ordid&mdash;I only hinted what I thought
&mdash;But, I don't pretend to impo&s;e&mdash;&endq;
&startq;Yes, &s;ir, (re&s;umed the lady) it is
your prerogative to command, and my
duty to obey&mdash;&endq;</P>
<P>So &s;aying, &s;he bur&s;t into tears and re|tired
to her chamber, where &s;he was join|ed
by her aunt&mdash;He endeavoured to re|collect
<PB N="128" REF="128">
him&s;elf, and act with vigour of
mind on this occa&s;ion; but was betray|ed
by the tenderne&s;s of his nature, which
was the greate&s;t defect of his con&s;titution.
He found the aunt in tears, and the niece
in a fit, which held her the be&s;t part of
eight hours, at the expiration of which,
&s;he began to talk incoherently about
<HI>death</HI> and her <HI>dear hu&s;band,</HI> who had &s;at
by her all this time, and now pre&s;&s;ed her
hand to his lips, in a tran&s;port of grief
and penitence for the offence he had
given&mdash;From thence forward, he care|fully
avoided mentioning the country;
and they continued to be &s;ucked deeper
and deeper into the vortex of extrava|gance
and di&s;&s;ipation, leading what is
called a fa&s;hionable life in town&mdash;About
the latter end of July, however, Mrs.
Baynard, in order to exhibit a proof of
conjugal obedience, de&s;ired of her own
accord, that they might pay a vi&s;it to his
country hou&s;e, as there was no company
left in London. He would have excu&s;ed
him&s;elf from this excur&s;ion, which was
no part of the oeconomical plan he had
propo&s;ed; but &s;he in&s;i&s;ted upon making
this &s;acrifice to his ta&s;te and prejudices,
and away they went with &s;uch an equi|page
as a&s;toni&s;hed the whole country&mdash;
<PB N="129" REF="129">
All that remained of the &s;ea&s;on was en|gro&s;&s;ed
by receiving and returning vi&s;its
in the neighbourhood; and, in this in|tercour&s;e,
it was di&s;covered that &s;ir John
Chickwell had a hou&s;e-&s;teward and one
footman in livery more than the comple|ment
of Mr. Baynard's hou&s;ehold. This
remark was made by the aunt at table,
and a&s;&s;ented to by the hu&s;band, who ob|&s;erved
that &s;ir John Chickwell might ve|ry
well afford to keep more &s;ervants than
were found in the family of a man who
had not half his fortune. Mrs. Baynard
are no &s;upper that evening; but was &s;eiz|ed
with a violent fit, which completed
her triumph over the &s;pirit of her con&s;ort.
The two &s;upernumerary &s;ervants were ad|ded&mdash;
The family plate was &s;old for old
&s;ilver, and a new &s;ervice procured; fa|&s;hionable
furniture was provided, and the
whole hou&s;e turned top&s;y turvy.</P>
<P>At their return to London, in the be|ginning
of winter, he, with a heavy heart,
communicated the&s;e particulars to me in
confidence. Before his marriage, he had
introduced me to the lady as his particu|lar
friend; and I now offered in that cha|racter,
to lay before her the nece&s;&s;ity of
reforming her oeconomy, if &s;he had any
regard to the intere&s;t of her own family,
<PB N="130" REF="130">
or complai&s;ance for the inclinations of her
hu&s;band&mdash;But Baynard declined my of|fer,
on the &s;uppo&s;ition that his wife's
nerves were too delicate to bear expo&s;tu|lation;
and that it would only &s;erve to
overwhelm her with &s;uch di&s;tre&s;s as would
make him&s;elf mi&s;erable.</P>
<P>Baynard is a man of &s;pirit, and had &s;he
proved a termagant, he would have
known how to deal with her; but, either
by accident or in&s;tinct, &s;he fa&s;tened upon
the weak &s;ide of his &s;oul, and held it &s;o
fa&s;t, that he has been in &s;ubjection ever
&s;ince&mdash;I afterwards advi&s;ed him to carry
her abroad to France or Italy, where he
might gratify her vanity for half the ex|pence
it co&s;t him in England; and this
advice he followed accordingly&mdash;She was
agreeably flattered with the idea of &s;eeing
and knowing foreign parts, and foreign
fa&s;hions; of being pre&s;ented to &s;ove|reigns,
and living familiarly with princes.
She forthwith &s;eized the hint which I
had thrown out on purpo&s;e, and even
pre&s;&s;ed Mr. Baynard to ha&s;ten his depar|ture;
&s;o that in a few weeks they cro&s;&s;ed
the &s;ea to France, with a moderate train,
&s;till including the aunt; who was her
bo&s;om coun&s;ellor, and abetted her in all
her oppo&s;ition to her hu&s;band's will&mdash;
<PB N="131" REF="131">
Since that period, I have had little or no
opportunity to renew our former corre|&s;pondence&mdash;
All that I knew of his tran&s;|actions,
amounted to no more than that
after an ab&s;ence of two years, they re|turned
&s;o little improved in oeconomy,
that they launched out into new oceans of
extravagance, which, at length, obliged
him to mortgage his e&s;tate&mdash;By this time
&s;he had bore him three children, of which
the la&s;t only &s;urvives, a puny boy of
twelve or thirteen, who will be ruined in
his education by the indulgence of his
mother.</P>
<P>As for Baynard, neither his own good
&s;en&s;e, nor the dread of indigence, nor
the con&s;ideration of his children, has been
of force &s;ufficient to &s;timulate him into
the re&s;olution of breaking at once the
&s;hameful &s;pell by which he &s;eems en|chanted&mdash;
With a ta&s;te capable of the
mo&s;t refined enjoyment, a heart glowing
with all the warmth of friend&s;hip and hu|manity,
and a di&s;po&s;ition &s;trongly turned
to the more rational plea&s;ures of a retired
and country life, he is hurried about in a
perpetual tumult, amid&s;t a mob of beings
plea&s;ed with rattles, baubles, and gew|gaws,
&s;o void of &s;en&s;e and di&s;tinction,
that even the mo&s;t acute philo&s;ophy would
<PB N="132" REF="132">
find it a very hard ta&s;k to di&s;cover for
what wi&s;e purpo&s;e of providence they
were created&mdash;Friend&s;hip is not to be
found; nor can the amu&s;ements for which
he &s;ighs be enjoyed within the rotation of
ab&s;urdity, to which he is doomed for life.
He has long re&s;igned all views of improv|ing
his fortune by management and atten|tion
to the exerci&s;e of hu&s;bandry, in
which he delighted; and as to dome&s;tic
happine&s;s, not the lea&s;t glimp&s;e of hope
remains to amu&s;e his imagination. Thus
bla&s;ted in all his pro&s;pects, he could not
fail to be overwhelmed with melancholy
and chagrin, which have preyed upon
his health and &s;pirits in &s;uch a manner,
that he is now threatened with a con|&s;umption.</P>
<P>I have given you a &s;ketch of the man,
whom the other day I went to vi&s;it&mdash;At
the gate we found a great number of pow|dered
lacquies, but no civility&mdash;After we
had &s;at a con&s;iderable time in the coach,
we were told, that Mr. Baynard had rode
out, and that his lady was dre&s;&s;ing; but
we were introduced to a parlour, &s;o very
fine and delicate, that in all appearance it
was de&s;igned to be &s;een only, not inha|bited.
The chairs and couches were
carved, gilt, and covered with rich da|ma&s;k,
<PB N="133" REF="133">
&s;o &s;mooth and &s;lick, that they
looked as if they had never been &s;at upon.
There was no carpet on the floor; but
the boards were rubbed and waxed in &s;uch
a manner, that we could not walk, but
were obliged to &s;lide along them; and as
for the &s;tove, it was too bright and po|li&s;hed
to be polluted with &s;ea coal, or
&s;tained by the &s;moke of any gro&s;s mate|rial
fire&mdash;When we had remained above
half an hour &s;acrificing to the inho&s;pita|ble
powers in this <HI>temple of cold reception,</HI>
my friend Baynard arrived, and under|&s;tanding
we were in the hou&s;e, made his
appearance, &s;o meagre, yellow, and de|jected,
that I really &s;hould not have
known him, had I met with him in any
other place&mdash;Running up to me, with
great eagerne&s;s, he &s;trained me in his em|brace,
and his heart was &s;o full, that for
&s;ome minutes he could not &s;peak&mdash;Hav|ing
&s;aluted us all round, he perceived our
uncomfortable &s;ituation, and conducting
us into another apartment, which had fire
in the chimney, called for chocolate&mdash;
Then, withdrawing, he returned with a
compliment from his wife, and, in the
mean time, pre&s;ented his &s;on Harry, a
&s;hambling, blear-eyed boy, in the habit
of a hu&s;&s;ar; very rude, forward, and im|pertinent&mdash;
<PB N="134" REF="134">
His father would have &s;ent
him to a boarding-&s;chool, but his mam|ma
and aunt would not hear of his lying
out of the hou&s;e; &s;o that there was a cler|gyman
engaged as his tutor in the fa|mily.</P>
<P>As it was but ju&s;t turned of twelve,
and the whole hou&s;e was in commotion to
prepare a formal entertainment, I fore|&s;aw
it would be late before we dined, and
propo&s;ed a walk to Mr. Baynard, that
we might conver&s;e together freely. In
the cour&s;e of this perambulation, when I
expre&s;&s;ed &s;ome &s;urpri&s;e that he had re|turned
&s;o &s;oon from Italy, he gave me to
under&s;tand, that his going abroad had no$
at all an&s;wered the purpo&s;e, for which he
left England; that although the expence
of living was not &s;o great in Italy as at
home, re&s;pect being had to the &s;ame rank
of life in both countries, it had been
found nece&s;&s;ary for him to lift him&s;elf a|bove
his u&s;ual &s;tile, that he might be on
&s;ome footing with the counts, marqui&s;es,
and cavalieres, with whom he kept com|pany&mdash;
He was obliged to hire a great
number of &s;ervants, to take off a great
variety of rich cloaths, and to keep a
&s;umptuous table for the fa&s;hionable &s;coroc|coni
of the country; who, without a con|&s;ideration
<PB N="135" REF="135">
of this kind, would not have
payed any attention to an untitled fo|reigner,
let his family or fortune be ever
&s;o re&s;pectable&mdash;Be&s;ides, Mrs. Baynard was
continually &s;urrounded by a train of ex|pen&s;ive
loungers, under the denominations
of language-ma&s;ters, mu&s;icians, painters,
and ciceroni; and had actually fallen in|to
the di&s;ea&s;e of buying pictures and an|tiques
upon her own judgment, which was
far from being infallible&mdash;At length &s;he
met with an affront, which gave her a
di&s;gu&s;t to Italy, and drove her back to
England with &s;ome precipitation. By
means of frequenting the dutche&s;s of
B&mdash;'s conver&s;azione, while her grace
was at Rome, Mrs. Baynard became ac|quainted
with all the fa&s;hionable people
of that city, and was admitted to their a&s;|&s;emblies
without &s;cruple&mdash;Thus favour|ed,
&s;he conceived too great an idea of
her own importance, and when the du|che&s;s
left Rome, re&s;olved to have a con|ver&s;azione
that &s;hould leave the Ro|mans
no room to regret her grace's de|parture.
She provided hands for a mu|&s;ical
entertainment, and &s;ent bighetti of
invitation to every per&s;on of di&s;tinction;
but not one Roman of the female &s;ex ap|peared
at her a&s;&s;embly&mdash;She was that night
<PB N="136" REF="136">
&s;eized with a violent fit, and kept her bed
three days, at the expiration of which &s;he
declared that the air of Italy would be
the ruin of her con&s;titution. In order to
prevent this cata&s;trophe, &s;he was &s;peedily
removed to Geneva, from whence they
returned to England by the way of Lyons
and Paris. By the time they arrived at
Calais, &s;he had purcha&s;ed &s;uch a quanti|ty
of &s;ilks, &s;tuffs, and laces, that it was
nece&s;&s;ary to hire a ve&s;&s;el to &s;muggle them
over, and this ve&s;&s;el was taken by a cu&s;|tom-hou&s;e
cutter; &s;o that they lo&s;t the
whole cargo, which had co&s;t them above
eight hundred pounds.</P>
<P>It now appeared, that her travels had
produced no effect upon her, but that of
making her more expen&s;ive and fanta&s;tic
than ever:&mdash;She affected to lead the fa&s;hion,
not only in point of female dre&s;s, but in eve|ry
article of ta&s;te and connoi&s;&s;eur&s;hip. She
made a drawing of the new fa&ccedil;ade to the
hou&s;e in the country; &s;he pulled up the
trees, and pulled down the walls of the
garden, &s;o as to let in the ea&s;terly wind,
which Mr. Baynard's ance&s;tors had been
at great pains to exclude. To &s;hew her
ta&s;te in laying out ground, &s;he &s;eized into
her own hand a farm of two hundred
acres, about a mile from the hou&s;e, which
<PB N="137" REF="137">
&s;he parcelled out into walks and &s;hrub|beries,
having a great ba&s;on in the middle,
into which &s;he poured a whole &s;tream that
turned two mills, and afforded the be&s;t
trout in the country. The bottom of the
ba&s;on, however, was &s;o ill &s;ecured, that it
would not hold the water which &s;trained
through the earth, and made a bog of the
whole plantation: in a word, the ground
which formerly payed him one hundred
and fifty pounds a year, now co&s;t him
two hundred pounds a year to keep it
in tolerable order, over and above the fir&s;t
expence of trees, &s;hrubs, flowers, turf,
and gravel. There was not an inch of
garden ground left about the hou&s;e, nor
a tree that produced fruit of any kind;
nor did he rai&s;e a tru&s;s of hay, or a bu&s;hel
of oats for his hor&s;es, nor had he a &s;ingle
cow to afford milk for his tea; far le&s;s did
he ever dream of feeding his own mutton,
pigs, and poultry: every article of hou&s;e|keeping,
even the mo&s;t incon&s;iderable,
was brought from the next market town,
at the di&s;tance of five miles, and thither
they &s;ent a courier every morning to fetch
hot rolls for breakfa&s;t. In &s;hort, Baynard
fairly owned that he &s;pent double his
income, and that in a few years he &s;hould
be obliged to &s;ell his e&s;tate for the pay|ment
<PB N="138" REF="138">
of his creditors. He &s;aid his wife
had &s;uch delicate nerves, and &s;uch imbe|cillity
of &s;pirit, that &s;he could neither
bear remon&s;trance, be it ever &s;o gentle,
nor practi&s;e any &s;cheme of retrenchment,
even if &s;he perceived the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;uch
a mea&s;ure. He had therefore cea&s;ed
&s;truggling again&s;t the &s;tream, and endea|voured
to reconcile him&s;elf to ruin, by
reflecting that his child at lea&s;t, would
inherit his mother's fortune, which was &s;e|cured
to him by the contract of marriage.</P>
<P>The detail which he gave me of his
affairs, filled me at once with grief and
indignation. I inveighed bitterly again&s;t
the indi&s;cretion of his wife, and reproach|ed
him with his unmanly acquie&s;cence un|der
the ab&s;urd tyranny which &s;he exerted.
I exhorted him to recollect his re&s;olution,
and make one effectual effort to di&s;engage
him&s;elf from a thraldom, equally &s;hame|ful
and pernicious. I offered him all the
a&s;&s;i&s;tance in my power. I undertook to
regulate his affairs, and even to bring
about a reformation in his family, if he
would only authori&s;e me to execute the
plan I &s;hould form for his advantage. I
was &s;o affected by the &s;ubject, that I could
not help mingling tears with my remon|&s;trances,
and Baynard was &s;o penetrated
<PB N="139" REF="139">
with the&s;e marks of my affection, that he
lo&s;t all power of utterance. He pre&s;&s;ed
me to his brea&s;t with great emotion, and
wept in &s;ilence. At length he exclaimed,
&startq;Friend&s;hip is undoubtedly the mo&s;t
precious balm of life! Your words,
dear Bramble, have in a great mea&s;ure
recalled me from an aby&s;s of de&s;pon|dence,
in which I have been long over|whelmed&mdash;
I will, upon honour, make
you acquainted with a di&s;tinct &s;tate of
my affairs, and, as far as I am able to
go, will follow the cour&s;e you pre&s;cribe.
But there are certain lengths which my
nature&mdash;The truth is, there are ten|der
connexions, of which a bachelor
has no idea&mdash;Shall I own my weakne&s;s?
I cannot bear the thoughts of making
that woman unea&s;y&mdash;&endq; &startq;And yet,
(cried I) &s;he has &s;een you unhappy for
a &s;eries of years&mdash;unhappy from her
mi&s;conduct, without ever &s;hewing the
lea&s;t inclination to alleviate your di&s;|tre&s;s&mdash;&endq;
&startq;Neverthele&s;s (&s;aid he) I am
per&s;uaded &s;he loves me with the mo&s;t
warm affection; but the&s;e are incon|gruities
in the compo&s;ition of the hu|man
mind which I hold to be inexpli|cable.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="140" REF="140">
I was &s;hocked at his infatuation, and
changed the &s;ubject, after we had agreed
to maintain a clo&s;e corre&s;pondence for the
future&mdash;He then gave me to under&s;tand,
that he had two neighbours, who, like
him&s;elf, were driven by their wives at full
&s;peed, in the high road to bankruptcy
and ruin. All the three hu&s;bands were
of di&s;po&s;itions very different from each
other, and, according to this variation,
their con&s;orts were admirably &s;uited to
the purpo&s;e of keeping them all three in
&s;ubjection. The views of the ladies were
exactly the &s;ame. They vied in grandeur,
that is, in o&s;tentation, with the wife of Sir
Charles Chickwell, who had four times
their fortune; and &s;he again piqued her|&s;elf
upon making an equal figure with a
neighbouring peere&s;s, who&s;e revenue tre|bled
her own. Here then was the fable of
the frog and the ox, realized in four diffe|rent
in&s;tances within the &s;ame county: one
large fortune, and three moderate e&s;tates,
in a fair way of being bur&s;t by the infla|tion
of female vanity; and in three of
the&s;e in&s;tances, three different forms of
female tyranny were exerci&s;ed. Mr. Bay|nard
was &s;ubjugated by practi&s;ing upon
the tenderne&s;s of his nature. Mr. Milk|&s;an,
being of a timorous di&s;po&s;ition,
<PB N="141" REF="141">
truckled to the in&s;olence of a termagant.
Mr. Sowerby, who was of a temper nei|ther
to be moved by fits, nor driven by
menaces, had the fortune to be fitted with
a help$ate, who a&s;&s;ailed him with the
weapons of irony and &s;atire; &s;ometimes
&s;nee$ing in the way of compliment; &s;ome|times
throwing out &s;arca&s;tic compari&s;ons,
implying reproaches upon his want of
ta&s;te, &s;pirit, and genero&s;ity: by which
means &s;he &s;timulated his pa&s;&s;ions from one
act of extravagance to another, ju&s;t as the
circum&s;tances of her vanity required.</P>
<P>All the&s;e three ladies have at this time
the &s;ame number of hor&s;es, carriages, and
&s;ervants in and out of livery; the &s;ame
variety of dre&s;s; the &s;ame quantity of
plate and china; the like ornaments in
furniture; and in their entertainments
they endeavour to exceed one another in
the variety, delicacy, and expence of their
di&s;hes. I believe it will be found upon
enquiry, that nineteen out of twenty, who
are ruined by extravagance, fall a &s;acrifice
to the ridiculous pride and vanity of &s;illy
women, who&s;e parts are held in contempt
by the very men whom they pillage and
en&s;lave. Thank heaven, Dick, that among
all the follies and weakne&s;&s;es of human
<PB N="142" REF="142">
nature, I have not yet fallen into that of
matrimony.</P>
<P>After Baynard and I had di&s;cu&s;&s;ed all
the&s;e matters at lei&s;ure, we returned to|wards
the hou&s;e, and met Jery with our
two women, who had come forth to take
the air, as the lady of the man&s;ion had
not yet made her appearance. In &s;hort,
Mrs. Baynard did not produce her&s;elf, till
about a quarter of an hour before dinner
was upon the table. Then her hu&s;band
brought her into the parlour, accompa|nied
by her aunt and &s;on, and &s;he receiv|ed
us with a coldne&s;s of re&s;erve &s;ufficient
to freeze the very &s;oul of ho&s;pitality.
Though &s;he knew I had been the intimate
friend of her hu&s;band, and had often &s;een
me with him in London, &s;he &s;hewed no
marks of recognition or regard, when I
addre&s;&s;ed my&s;elf to her in the mo&s;t friend|ly
terms of &s;alutation. She did not even
expre&s;s the common complement of, <HI>I am
glad to &s;ee you;</HI> or, <HI>I hope you have enjoyed
your health &s;ince we had the plea&s;ure of &s;ee|ing
you;</HI> or &s;ome &s;uch words of cour&s;e:
nor did &s;he once open her mouth in the
way of welcome to my &s;i&s;ter and my niece:
but &s;at in &s;ilence like a &s;tatue, with an
a&s;pect of in&s;en&s;ibility. Her aunt, the
model upon which &s;he had been formed,
<PB N="143" REF="143">
was indeed the very e&s;&s;ence of in&s;ipid for|mality:
but the boy was very pert and
impudent, and prated without cea&s;ing.</P>
<P>At dinner, the lady maintained the
&s;ame ungracious indifference, never &s;peak|ing
but in whi&s;pers to her aunt; and as
to the repa&s;t, it was made up of a parcel
of kick&s;haws, contrived by a French
cook, without one &s;ub&s;tantial article
adapted to the &s;atisfaction of an Engli&s;h
appetite. The pottage was little better
than bread &s;oaked in di&s;hwa&s;hings, luke|warm.
The ragouts looked as if they
had been once eaten and half dige&s;ted:
the frica&s;&s;ees were involved in a na&s;ty yel|low
poultice; and the rotis were &s;corched
and &s;tinking, for the honour of the fu|met.
The de&s;ert con&s;i&s;ted of faded fruit
and iced froth, a good emblem of our land|lady's
character; the table-beer was &s;our,
the water foul, and the wine vapid; but
there was a parade of plate and china, and
a powdered lacquey &s;tood behind every
chair, except tho&s;e of the ma&s;ter and
mi&s;tre&s;s of the hou&s;e, who were &s;erved by
two valets dre&s;&s;ed like gentlemen. We
dined in a large old Gothic parlour, which
was formerly the hall. It was now paved
with marble, and, notwith&s;tanding the
fire, which had been kindled about an
<PB N="144" REF="144">
hour, &s;truck me with &s;uch a chill &s;en&s;a|tion,
that when I entered it the teeth
chattered in my jaws&mdash;In &s;hort, every
thing was cold, comfortle&s;s, and di&s;gu&s;t|ing,
except the looks of my friend Bay|nard,
which declared the warmth of his
affection and humanity.</P>
<P>After dinner we withdrew into another
apartment, where the boy began to be
impertinently trouble&s;ome to my niece
Liddy. He wanted a play-fellow, for|&s;ooth;
and would have romped with her,
had &s;he encouraged his advances&mdash;He was
even &s;o impudent as to &s;natch a ki&s;s, at
which &s;he changed countenance, and
&s;eemed unea&s;y; and though his father
checked him for the rudene&s;s of his be|haviour,
he became &s;o outrageous as to
thru&s;t his hand in her bo&s;om: an in&s;ult to
which &s;he did not tamely &s;ubmit, though
one of the milde&s;t creatures upon earth.
Her eyes &s;parkling with re&s;entment, &s;he
&s;tarted up, and lent him &s;uch a box in
the ear, as &s;ent him &s;taggering to the other
&s;ide of the room.</P>
<P>&startq;Mi&s;s Melford, (cried his father) you
have treated him with the utmo&s;t
propriety&mdash;I am only &s;orry that the
impertinence of any child of mine
&s;hould have occa&s;ioned this exertion of
<PB N="145" REF="145">
your &s;pirit, which I cannot but applaud
and admire.&endq; His wife was &s;o far
from a&s;&s;enting to the candour of his apo|logy,
that &s;he ro&s;e from table, and, taking
her &s;on by the hand, &startq;Come, child,
(&s;aid &s;he) your father cannot abide
you.&endq; So &s;aying, &s;he retired with this
hopeful youth, and was followed by her
gouvernante: but neither the one nor the
other deigned to take the lea&s;t notice of
the company.</P>
<P>Baynard was exceedingly di&s;concerted;
but I perceived his unea&s;ine&s;s was tinctur|ed
with re&s;entment, and derived a good
omen from this di&s;covery. I ordered the
hor&s;es to be put to the carriage, and,
though he made &s;ome efforts to detain us
all night, I in&s;i&s;ted upon leaving the hou&s;e
immediately; but, before I went away, I
took an opportunity of &s;peaking to him
again in private. I &s;aid every thing I could
recollect, to animate his endeavours in
&s;haking off tho&s;e &s;hameful trammels. I
made no &s;cruple to declare, that his wife
was unworthy of that tender complai&s;ance
which he had &s;hewn for her foibles: that
&s;he was dead to all the genuine &s;entiments
of conjugal affection; in&s;en&s;ible of her
own honour and intere&s;t, and &s;eemingly
de&s;titute of common &s;en&s;e and reflection.
<PB N="146" REF="146">
I conjured him to remember what he
owed to his father's hou&s;e, to his own re|putation,
and to his family, including even
this unrea&s;onable woman her&s;elf, who was
driving on blindly to her own de&s;truction.
I advi&s;ed him to form a plan for retrench|ing
&s;uperfluous expence, and try to con|vince
the aunt of the nece&s;&s;ity for &s;uch a
reformation, that &s;he might gradually pre|pare
her niece for its execution; and I
exhorted him to turn that di&s;agreeable
piece of formality out of the hou&s;e, if he
&s;hould find her aver&s;e to his propo&s;al.</P>
<P>Here he interrupted me with a &s;igh, ob|&s;erving
that &s;uch a &s;tep would undoubted|ly
be fatal to Mrs. Baynard&mdash;&startq;I &s;hall
lo&s;e all patience, (cried I), to hear you
talk &s;o weakly&mdash;Mrs. Baynard's fits
will never hurt her con&s;titution. I
believe in my con&s;cience they are all
affected: I am &s;ure &s;he has no feeling
for your di&s;tre&s;&s;es; and, when you are
ruined, &s;he will appear to have no feel|ing
for her own.&endq; Finally, I took his
word and honour, that he would make an
effort, &s;uch as I had advi&s;ed; that he
would form a plan of oeconomy, and, if
he found it impracticable without my a&s;|&s;i&s;tance,
he would come to Bath in the
winter, where I promi&s;ed to give him the
<PB N="147" REF="147">
meeting, and contribute all in my power
to the retrieval of his affairs&mdash;With this
mutual engagement we parted; and I &s;hall
think my&s;elf &s;upremely happy, if, by my
means, a worthy man, whom I love and
e&s;teem, can be &s;aved from mi&s;ery, di&s;grace,
and de&s;pair.</P>
<P>I have only one friend more to vi&s;it in
this part of the country, but he is of a
complexion very different from that of
Baynard. You have heard me mention
Sir Thomas Bullford, whom I knew in Ita|ly.
He is now become a country gentle|man;
but, being di&s;abled by the gout
from enjoying any amu&s;ement abroad, he
entertains him&s;elf within doors, by keep|ing
open hou&s;e for all comers, and play|ing
upon the oddities and humours of his
company: but he him&s;elf is generally the
greate&s;t original at his table. He is very
good-humoured, talks much, and laughs
without cea&s;ing. I am told that all the
u&s;e he makes of his under&s;tanding at pre|&s;ent,
is to excite mirth, by exhibiting his
gue&s;ts in ludicrous attitudes. I know not
how far we may furni&s;h him with enter|tainment
of this kind, but I am re&s;olv|ed
to beat up his quarters, partly with a
view to laugh with the knight him&s;elf,
and partly to pay my re&s;pects to his lady,
<PB N="148" REF="148">
a good-natured &s;en&s;ible woman, with whom
he lives upon very ea&s;y terms, although &s;he
has not had the good fortune to bring him
an heir to his e&s;tate.</P>
<P>And now, dear Dick, I mu&s;t tell you
for your comfort, that you are the only
man upon earth to whom I would pre|&s;ume
to &s;end &s;uch a long-winded epi&s;tle,
which I could not find in my heart to cur|tail,
becau&s;e the &s;ubject intere&s;ted the
warme&s;t pa&s;&s;ions of my heart; neither
will I make any other apology to a cor|re&s;pondent
who has been &s;o long accu&s;|tomed
to the impertinence of</P>

<PB N="149" REF="149">
<OPENER>To Sir WATKIN PHILLIPS, Bart. at
Oxon.
DEAR KNIGHT,</OPENER>
<P>I BELIEVE, there is &s;omething mi&s;|chievious
in my di&s;po&s;ition, for nothing
diverts me &s;o much as to &s;ee certain cha|racters
tormented with fal&s;e terrors.&mdash;
We la&s;t night lodged at the hou&s;e of &s;ir
Thomas Bullford, an old friend of my
uncle, a jolly fellow, of moderate intel|lects,
who, in &s;pite of the gout, which
hath lamed him, is re&s;olved to be merry
to the la&s;t; and mirth he has a particular
knack in extracting from his gue&s;ts, let
their humour be never &s;o cau&s;tic or refrac|tory.&mdash;
Be&s;ides our company, there was in
the hou&s;e a fat-headed ju&s;tice of the peace,
called Frogmore, and a country prac|titioner
in &s;urgery, who &s;eemed to be our
landlord's chief companion and confi|dant.&mdash;
We found the knight &s;itting on a
couch, with his crutches by his &s;ide, and
his feet &s;upported on cu&s;hions; but he
<PB N="150" REF="150">
received us with a hearty welcome, and
&s;eemed greatly rejoiced at our arrival.&mdash;
After tea, we were entertained with a &s;o|nata
on the harp&s;ichord by lady Bullford,
who &s;ung and played to admiration; but
&s;ir Thomas &s;eemed to be a little a&s;inine
in the article of ears, though he affected
to be in raptures, and begged his wife to
favour us with an <HI>arietta</HI> of her own com|po&s;ing.&mdash;
This <HI>ari$tta,</HI> however, &s;he no
&s;ooner began to perform, than he and
the ju&s;tice fell a&s;leep; but the mo|ment
&s;he cea&s;ed playing, the knight
waked &s;norting, and exclaimed, &startq;<HI>O
cara!</HI> what d'ye think, gentlemen?
Will you talk any more of your Pargo|le&s;i
and your Corelli?&endq;&mdash;At the &s;ame
time, he thru&s;t his tongue in one cheek,
and leered with one eye at the doctor and
me, who &s;at on his left hand.&mdash;He con|cluded
the pantomime with a loud laugh,
which he could command at all times ex|tempore.&mdash;
Notwith&s;tanding his di&s;order,
he did not do penance at &s;upper, nor did
he ever refu&s;e his gla&s;s when the toa&s;t
went round, but rather encouraged a
quick circulation, both by precept and
example.</P>
<P>I &s;oon perceived the doctor had made
him&s;elf very nece&s;&s;ary to the baronet.&mdash;
<PB N="151" REF="151">
He was the whet&s;tone of his wit, the butt
of his &s;atire, and his operator in certain
experiments of humour, which were oc|ca&s;ionally
tried upon &s;trangers.&mdash;Ju&s;tice
Frogmore was an excellent &s;ubject for this
&s;pecies of philo&s;ophy; &s;leek and corpu|lent,
&s;olemn and &s;hallow, he had &s;tudied
Burn with uncommon application, but
he &s;tudied nothing &s;o much as the art of
living (that is, eating) well.&mdash;This fat
buck had often afforded good &s;port to our
landlord; and he was frequently &s;tarted
with tolerable &s;ucce&s;s, in the cour&s;e of
this evening; but the baronet's appetite
for ridicule &s;eemed to be chiefly excited
by the appearance, addre&s;s, and conver|&s;ation
of Li&s;mahago, whom he attempted
in all the different modes of expo&s;ition;
but he put me in mind of a conte&s;t that
I once &s;aw betwixt a young hound and an
old hedge-hog&mdash;The dog turned him over
and over, and bounced, and barked, and
mumbled; but as often as he attempted
to bite, he felt a prickle in his jaws, and
recoiled in manife&s;t confu&s;ion:&mdash;The
captain, when left to him&s;elf, will not
fail to turn his ludicrous &s;ide to the com|pany,
but if any man attempts to force
him into that attitude, he becomes &s;tub|born
<PB N="152" REF="152">
as a mule, and unmanageable as an
elephant unbroke.</P>
<P>Divers tolerable jokes were cracked
upon the ju&s;tice, who ate a mo&s;t uncon|&s;cionable
&s;upper, and, among other
things, a large plate of broiled mu&s;h|rooms,
which he had no &s;ooner &s;wallowed
than the doctor ob&s;erved, with great gra|vity,
that they were of the kind called
<HI>champignons,</HI> which in &s;ome con&s;titutions
had a poi&s;onous effect.&mdash;Mr. Frogmore,
&s;tartled at this remark, a&s;ked, in &s;ome
confu&s;ion, why he had not been &s;o kind
as to give him that notice &s;ooner.&mdash;He
an&s;wered, that he took it for granted, by
his eating them &s;o heartily, that he was
u&s;ed to the di&s;h; but as he &s;eemed to be
under &s;ome apprehen&s;ion, he pre&s;cribed
a bumper of plague water, which the
ju&s;tice drank off immediately, and retired
to re&s;t, not without marks of terror
and di&s;quiet.</P>
<P>At midnight we were &s;hewn to our
different chambers, and in half an hour,
I was fa&s;t a&s;leep in bed; but about three
o'clock in the morning I was waked with
a di&s;mal cry of <HI>Fire!</HI> and &s;tarting up, ran
to the window in my &s;hirt.&mdash;The night
was dark and &s;tormy; and a number of
<PB N="153" REF="153">
people half-dre&s;&s;ed ran backwards and
forwards thro' the court-yard, with links
and lanthorns, &s;eemingly in the utmo&s;t
hurry and trepidation.&mdash;Slipping on my
cloaths in a twinkling, I ran down &s;tairs,
and, upon inquiry, found the fire was
confined to a back-&s;tair, which led to a
detached apartment where Li&s;mahago
lay.&mdash;By this time, the lieutenant was
alarmed by bawling at his window, which
was in the &s;econd &s;tory, but he could not
find his cloaths in the dark, and his room|door
was locked on the out&s;ide.&mdash;The
&s;ervants called to him, that the hou&s;e had
been robbed; that, without all doubt,
the villains had taken away his cloaths,
fa&s;tened the door, and &s;et the hou&s;e on
fire, for the &s;tair-ca&s;e was in flames.&mdash;In
this dilemma the poor lieutenant ran about
the room naked like a &s;quirrel in a cage,
popping out his head at the window be|tween
whiles, and imploring a&s;&s;i&s;tance.&mdash;
At length, the knight in per&s;on was
brought out in his chair, attended by my
uncle and all the family, including our
aunt Tabitha, who &s;creamed, and cried,
and tore her hair, as if &s;he had been di&s;|tracted.&mdash;
Sir Thomas had already ordered
his people to bring a long ladder, which
was applied to the captain's window, and
<PB N="154" REF="154">
now he exorted him earne&s;tly to de&s;cend.
&mdash;There was no need of much rhetoric
to per&s;uade Li&s;mahago, who forthwith
made his exit by the window, roaring all
the time to the people below to hold fa&s;t
the ladder.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the gravity of the
occa&s;ion, it was impo&s;&s;ible to behold this
&s;cene without being &s;eized with an incli|nation
to laugh. The rueful a&s;pect of
the lieutenant in his &s;hirt, with a quilted
night-cap fa&s;tened under his chin, and
his long lank limbs and po&s;teriors ex|po&s;ed
to the wind, made a very pic|ture&s;que
appearance, when illumined by
the links and torches which the &s;ervants
held up to light him in his de&s;cent.&mdash;All
the company &s;tood round the ladder, ex|cept
the knight, who &s;at in his chair, ex|claiming
from time to time, &startq;Lord have
mercy upon us!&mdash;&s;ave the gentleman's
life!&mdash;mind your footing, dear cap|tain!
&mdash;&s;oftly!&mdash;&s;tand fa&s;t!&mdash;cla&s;p the
ladder with both hands!&mdash;there!&mdash;
well done, my dear boy!&mdash;O bravo!&mdash;
an old &s;oldier for ever!&mdash;bring a blan|ket&mdash;
bring a warm blanket to com|fort
his poor carca&s;e&mdash;warm the bed
in the green room&mdash;give me your
hand, dear captain&mdash;I'm rejoiced to &s;ee
thee &s;afe and &s;ound with all my heart.&endq;
<PB N="155" REF="155">
Li&s;mahago was received at the foot of
the ladder by his innamorata, who &s;natch|ing
a blanket from one of the maids,
wrapped it about his body; two men-&s;er|vants
took him under the arms, and a
female conducted him to the green room,
&s;till accompanied by Mrs. Tabitha, who
&s;aw him fairly put to bed.&mdash;During this
whole tran&s;action, he &s;poke not a &s;yllable,
but looked exceeding grim, &s;ometimes at
one, &s;ometimes at another of the &s;pecta|tors,
who now adjourned in a body to the
parlour where we had &s;upped, every
one &s;urveying another with marks of
a&s;toni&s;hment and curio&s;ity.</P>
<P>The knight being &s;eated in an ea&s;y
chair, &s;eized my uncle by the hand, and
bur&s;ting into a long and loud laugh,
&startq;Matt, (cried he) crown me with oak, or
ivy, or laurel, or par&s;ley, or what you
will, and acknowledge this to be a <HI>coup
de maitre</HI> in the way of waggery&mdash;ha,
ha, ha!&mdash;Such a <HI>cami&s;icata, &s;cagliata,
beffata!&mdash;O, che roba!</HI>&mdash;O, what a

for a Ro&s;a, a Rembrandt, a Schalken!
&mdash;Zooks, I'll give a hundred guineas
to have it painted!&mdash;what a fine de|&s;cent

what a groupe below!&mdash;what expre&s;&s;ion
<PB N="156" REF="156">
above!&mdash;what an a&s;pect!&mdash;did you
mind the a&s;pect?&mdash;ha, ha, ha!&mdash;and
the limbs, and the mu&s;cles&mdash;every
toe denoted terror!&mdash;ha, ha, ha!&mdash;
then the blanket!&mdash;O, what <HI>co&s;tume?</HI>
St. Andrew! St. Lazarus! St. Barra|bas!
&mdash;ha, ha, ha!&endq; &startq;After all then,
(cried Mr. Bramble very gravely) this
was no more than a fal&s;e alarm.&mdash;We
have been frightened out of our beds,
and almo&s;t out of our &s;en&s;es, for the
joke's &s;ake.&endq; &startq;Ay, and &s;uch a joke!
(cried our landlord) &s;uch a farce! &s;uch
a <HI>denouement!</HI> &s;uch a <HI>cata&s;trophe!</HI>&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Have a little patience (replied our
'&s;quire); we are not yet come to the
<HI>cata&s;trophe;</HI> and pray God it may not
turn out a tragedy in&s;tead of a farce.
&mdash;The captain is one of tho&s;e &s;atur|nine
&s;ubjects, who have no idea of hu|mour.&mdash;
He never laughs in his own
per&s;on; nor can he bear that other
people &s;hould laugh at his expence.&mdash;
Be&s;ides, if the &s;ubject had been properly
cho&s;en, the joke was too &s;evere in all
con&s;cience.&endq; &startq;'Sdeath! (cried the
knight) I could not have bated him an
ace had he been may own father; and
as for the &s;ubject, &s;uch another does
not pre&s;ent it&s;elf once in half a centu|ry.&endq;
Here Mrs. Tabitha interpo&s;ing,
<PB N="157" REF="157">
and bridling up, declared, &s;he did not
&s;ee that Mr. Li&s;mahago was a fitter
&s;ubject for ridicule than the knight him|&s;elf;
and that &s;he was very much afraid,
he would very &s;oon find he had mi&s;taken
his man.&mdash;The baronet was a good
deal di&s;concerted by this intimation, &s;ay|ing,
that he mu&s;t be a Goth and a barba|rian,
if he did not enter into the &s;pirit of
&s;uch a happy and humorous contrivance.
&mdash;He begged, however, that Mr. Bram|ble
and his &s;i&s;ter would bring him to rea|&s;on;
and this reque&s;t was reinforced by
lady Bullford, who did not fail to read
the baronet a lecture upon his indi&s;cretion,
which lecture he received with &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion
on one &s;ide of his face, and a leer upon
the other.</P>
<P>We now went to bed for the &s;econd
time; and before I got up, my uncle had
vi&s;ited Li&s;mahago in the green room, and
u&s;ed &s;uch arguments with him, that when
we met in the parlour he &s;eemed to be
quite appea&s;ed.&mdash;He received the knight's
apology with a good grace, and even pro|fe&s;&s;ed
him&s;elf plea&s;ed at finding he had
contributed to the diver&s;ion of the com|pany.&mdash;
Sir Thomas &s;hook him by the
hand, laughing heartily; and then de&s;ired
a pinch of &s;nuff, in token of perfect re|conciliation&mdash;
<PB N="158" REF="158">
The lieutenant, putting his
hand in his wai&s;tcoat pocket, pulled out,
in&s;tead of his own Scotch mull, a very
fine gold &s;nuff box, which he no &s;ooner
perceived than he &s;aid, &startq;Here is a &s;mall
mi&s;take.&endq; &startq;No mi&s;take at all (cried
the baronet): a fair exchange is no
robbery.&mdash;Oblige me &s;o far, captain,
as to let me keep your mull as a
memorial.&endq; &startq;Sir, (&s;aid the lieute|nant)
the mull is much at your &s;ervice;
but this machine I can by no means
retain.&mdash;It looks like compounding a
&s;ort of felony in the code of honour.&mdash;
Be&s;ides, I don't know but there may
be another joke in this conveyance;
and I don't find my&s;elf di&s;po&s;ed to be
brought upon the &s;tage again.&mdash;I
won't pre&s;ume to make free with your
pockets, but I beg you will put it up
again with your own hand.&endq;&mdash;So
&s;aying, with a certain au&s;terity of a&s;|pect,
he pre&s;ented the &s;nuff-box to the
knight, who received it in &s;ome confu|&s;ion,
and re&s;tored the mull, which he
would by no means keep, except on the
terms of exchange.</P>
<P>This tran&s;action was like to give a
grave ca&s;t to the conver&s;ation, when my
uncle took notice that Mr. Ju&s;tice Frog|more
<PB N="159" REF="159">
had not made his appearance either
at the night-alarm, or now at the general
rendezvous. The baronet hearing Frog|more
mentioned, &startq;Od&s;o! (cried he) I
had forgot the ju&s;tice.&mdash;Pr'ythee, doc|tor,
go and bring him out of his ken|nel.&endq;
&mdash;Then laughing till his &s;ides were
well &s;haken, he &s;aid he would &s;hew the
captain&punc; that he was not the only per&s;on
of the drama exhibited for the entertain|ment
of the company. As to the night|&s;cene,
it could not affect the ju&s;tice, who
had been purpo&s;ely lodged in the farther
end of the hou&s;e, remote from the noi&s;e,
and lulled with a do&s;e of opium into the
bargain. In a few minutes, Mr. Ju&s;tice
was led into the parlour in his night-cap
and loo&s;e morning gown, rolling his head
from &s;ide to &s;ide, and groaning piteou&s;ly all
the way.&mdash;&startq;Je&s;u! neighbour Frogmore,
(exclaimed the baronet) what is the
matter?&mdash;you look as if you was not a
man for this world.&mdash;Set him down
&s;oftly on the couch&mdash;poor gentle|man!
&mdash;Lord have mercy upon us!&mdash;
What makes him &s;o pale, and yellow,
and bloated?&endq; &startq;Oh, &s;ir Thomas!
(cried the ju&s;tice) I doubt 'tis all over
with me&mdash;Tho&s;e mu&s;hrooms I eat at
your table have done my bu&s;ine&s;s&mdash;
<PB N="160" REF="160">
ah! oh! hey!&endq; &startq;Now the Lord
forbid! (&s;aid the other)&mdash;what! man,
have a good heart.&mdash;How does thy &s;to|mach
feel?&mdash;hah?&endq;</P>
<P>To this interrogation he made no re|ply,
but throwing a&s;ide his night gown,
di&s;covered that his wai&s;tcoat would not
meet upon his belly by five good inches at
lea&s;t. &startq;Heaven protect us all! (cried &s;ir
Thomas)&mdash;what a melancholy &s;pecta|cle!
&mdash;never did I &s;ee a man &s;o &s;udden|ly
&s;welled, but when he was either ju&s;t
dead, or ju&s;t dying.&mdash;Doctor, can'&s;t
thou do nothing for this poor object?&endq;
&startq;I don't think the ca&s;e is quite de&s;perate
(&s;aid the &s;urgeon), but I would advi&s;e
Mr. Frogmore to &s;ettle his affairs with
all expedition; the par&s;on may come
and pray by him, while I prepare a
gly&s;ter and an emetic draught.&endq; The
ju&s;tice, rolling his languid eyes, ejaculated
with great fervency, &startq;Lord, have mercy
upon us! Chri&s;t, have mercy upon
us!&endq;&mdash;Then he begged the &s;ur|geon,
in the name of God, to di&s;patch&mdash;
As for my worldly affairs, (&s;aid he)
they are all &s;ettled but one mortgage,
which mu&s;t be left to my heirs&mdash;but
my poor &s;oul! my poor &s;oul! what
will become of my poor &s;oul?&mdash;mi&s;er|able
<PB N="161" REF="161">
&s;inner that I am!&endq; &startq;Nay,
pr'ythee, my dear boy, compo&s;e thy|&s;elf
(re&s;umed the knight); con&s;ider the
mercy of heaven is infinite; thou can'&s;t
not have any &s;ins of a very deep dye
on thy con&s;cience, or the devil's in't.&endq;
&startq;Name not the devil (exclaimed the ter|rified
Frogmore), I have more &s;ins to
an&s;wer for than the world dreams of.&mdash;
Ah! friend, I have been &s;ly&mdash;&s;ly&mdash;
damn'd &s;ly!&mdash;Send for the par&s;on
without lo&s;s of time, and put me to
bed, for I am po&s;ting to eternity.&endq;&mdash;
He was accordingly rai&s;ed from the couch,
and &s;upported by two &s;ervants, who led
him back to his room; but before he
quitted the parlour, he intreated the good
company to a&s;&s;i&s;t him with their prayers.
&mdash;He added, &startq;Take warning by me, who
am &s;uddenly cut off in my prime, like
a flower of the field; and God forgive
you, &s;ir Thomas, for &s;uffering &s;uch
poi&s;onous tra&s;h to be eaten at your
table.&endq;</P>
<P>He was no &s;ooner removed out of hear|ing,
than the baronet abandoned him&s;elf
to a violent fit of laughing, in which he
was joined by the greate&s;t part of the
company; but we could hardly prevent
<PB N="162" REF="162">
the good lady from going to undeceive
the patient, by di&s;covering, that while he
&s;lept his wai&s;tcoat had been &s;traitened by
the contrivance of the &s;urgeon; and that
the di&s;order in his &s;tomach and bowels
was occa&s;ioned by &s;ome antimonial wine,
which he had taken over night, under the
denomination of plague-water.&mdash;She
&s;eemed to think that his apprehen&s;ion
might put an end to his life: the knight
&s;wore he was no &s;uch chicken, but a
tough old rogue, that would live long
enough to plague all his neighbours.&mdash;
Upon enquiry, we found his character did
not intitle him to much compa&s;&s;ion or re|&s;pect,
and therefore we let our landlord's
humour take its cour&s;e.&mdash;A gly&s;ter was
actually admini&s;tered by an old woman of
the family, who had been &s;ir Thomas's
nur&s;e, and the patient took a draught
made with oxymel of &s;quills to forward
the operation of the antimonial wine,
which had been retarded by the opiate of
the preceding night. He was vi&s;ited by
the vicar, who read prayers, and began to
take an account of the &s;tate of his &s;oul,
when tho&s;e medicines produced their ef|fect;
&s;o that the par&s;on was obliged to
hold his no&s;e while he poured forth &s;pi|ritual
<PB N="163" REF="163">
con&s;olation from his mouth. The
&s;ame expedient was u&s;ed by the knight
and me, who, with the doctor, entered
the chamber at this juncture, and found
Frogmore enthroned on an ea&s;ing-chair,
under the pre&s;&s;ure of a double evacuation.
The &s;hort intervals betwixt every heave
he employed in crying for mercy, confe&s;|&s;ing
his &s;ins, or a&s;king the vicar's opinion
of his ca&s;e; and the vicar an&s;wered, in a
&s;olemn &s;nuffling tone, that heightened the
ridicule of the &s;cene. The emetic having
done its office, the doctor interfered, and
ordered the patient to be put in bed again.
When he examined the <HI>egi&s;ta,</HI> and felt his
pul&s;e, he declared that much of the <HI>virus</HI>
was di&s;charged, and, giving him a compo|&s;ing
draught, a&s;&s;ured him he had good
hopes of his recovery.&mdash;This welcome
hint he received with the tears of joy in his
eyes, prote&s;ting, that if he &s;hould recover,
he would always think him&s;elf indebted
for his life to the great &s;kill and ten|derne&s;s
of his doctor, who&s;e hand he
&s;queezed with great fervor; and thus he
was left to his repo&s;e.</P>
<P>We were pre&s;&s;ed to &s;tay dinner, that
we might be witne&s;&s;es of his re&s;u&s;cita|tion;
but my uncle in&s;i&s;ted upon our
<PB N="164" REF="164">
departing before noon, that we might
reach this town before it &s;hould be dark.
&mdash;In the mean time, lady Bullford con|ducted
us into the garden to &s;ee a fi&s;h|pond
ju&s;t fini&s;hed, which Mr. Bramble
cen&s;ured as being too near the parlour,
where the knight now &s;at by him&s;elf,
dozing in an elbow-chair after the fa|tigues
of his morning atchievement.&mdash;
In this &s;ituation he reclined, with his
feet wrapped in f$annel, and &s;upported
in a line with his body, when the door
flying open with a violent &s;hock, lieu|tenant
Li&s;mahago ru&s;hed into the room
with horror in his looks, exclaiming,
&startq;A mad dog! a mad dog!&endq; and
throwing up the window &s;a&s;h, leaped
into the garden.&mdash;Sir Thomas, waked by
this tremendous exclamation, &s;tarted up,
and forgetting his gout, followed the
lieutenant's example by a kind of in&s;tinc|tive
impul&s;e.&mdash;He not only bolted thro'
the window like an arrow from a bow,
but ran up to his middle in the pond be|fore
he gave the lea&s;t &s;ign of recollection.
Then the captain began to bawl, &startq;Lord,
have mercy upon us!&mdash;pray, take care
of the gentleman!&mdash;for God's &s;ake,
mind your footing, my dear boy!&mdash;
<PB N="165" REF="165">
get warm blankets&mdash;comfort his poor
carca&s;e&mdash;warm the bed in the green
room.&endq;</P>
<P>Lady Bullford was thunder &s;truck at
this phaenomenon, and the re&s;t of the
company gazed in &s;ilent a&s;toni&s;hment,
while the &s;ervants ha&s;tened to a&s;&s;i&s;t their
ma&s;ter, who &s;uffered him&s;elf to be carried
back into the parlour without &s;peaking a
word.&mdash;Being in&s;tantly accommodated
with dry clothes and flannels, comforted
with a cordial, and replaced <HI>in &s;tatu quo,</HI>
one of the maids was ordered to chafe his
lower extremities, an operation in con|&s;equence
of which his &s;en&s;es &s;eemed to re|turn
and his good humour to revive.&mdash;
As we had followed him into the room,
he looked at every individual in his turn,
with a certain ludicrous expre&s;&s;ion in his
countenance, but fixed his eye in parti|cular
upon Li&s;mahago, who pre&s;ented
him with a pinch of &s;nuff, and when he
took it in &s;ilence, &startq;Sir Thomas Bullford,
(&s;aid he) I am much obliged to you
for all your favours, and &s;ome of them
I have endeavoured to repay in your
own coin&endq; &startq;Give me thy hand
(cried the baronet); thou ha&s;t indeed
payed me <HI>Scot and lot;</HI> and even left a
<PB N="166" REF="166">
balance in my hands, for which, in
pre&s;ence of this company, I promi&s;e to
be accountable.&endq;&mdash;So &s;aying, he laugh|ed
very heartily, and even &s;eemed to en|joy
the retaliation which had been exacted
at his own expence; but lady Bullford
looked very grave; and in all probabili|ty
thought the lieutenant had carried his
re&s;entment too far, con&s;idering that her
hu&s;band was valetudinary&mdash;but, accord|ing
to the proverb, <HI>he that will play at
bowls mu&s;t expect to meet with rubbers.</HI></P>
<P>I have &s;een a tame bear, very divert|ing
when properly managed, become a
very dangerous wild bea&s;t when teized
for the entertainment of the &s;pectators.&mdash;
As for Li&s;mahago, he &s;eemed to think
the fright and the cold bath would have
a good effect upon his patient's con&s;titu|tion;
but the doctor hinted &s;ome appre|hen&s;ion
that the gouty matter might, by
&s;uch a &s;udden &s;hock, be repelled from the
extremities and thrown upon &s;ome of the
more vital parts of the machine.&mdash;I
&s;hould be very &s;orry to &s;ee this progno&s;tic
verified upon our facetious landlord, who
told Mrs. Tabitha at parting, that he
hoped &s;he would remember him in the
di&s;tribution of the bride's favours, as he
<PB N="167" REF="167">
had taken &s;o much pains to put the cap|tain's
parts and mettle to the proof.&mdash;
After all, I am afraid our '&s;quire will ap|pear
to be the greate&s;t &s;ufferer by the b$|ronet's
wit; for his con&s;titution is by no
means calculated for night-alarms.&mdash;He
has yawned and &s;hivered all day, and
gone to bed without &s;upper; &s;o that, as
we have got into good quarters, I ima|gine
we &s;hall make a halt to-morrow; in

pa&s;&s;ed a-hor&s;eback, whom (gracious
Heaven!) I in&s;tantly di&s;covered to be
Wil&s;on! He wore a white riding-coat,
with the cape buttoned up to his chin;
looked remarkably pale, and pa&s;&s;ed at a
round trot, without &s;eeming to ob&s;erve
us&mdash;Indeed, he could not &s;ee us; for
there was a blind that concealed us from
the view. You may gue&s;s how I was af|fected
at this apparition&mdash;The light for|&s;ook
my eyes; and I was &s;eized with &s;uch
a palpitation and trembling, that I could
not &s;tand. I &s;at down upon a couch, and
&s;trove to compo&s;e my&s;elf, that my bro|ther
might not perceive my agitation;
but it was impo&s;&s;ible to e&s;cape his prying
eyes&mdash;He had ob&s;erved the object that
alarmed me; and, doubtle&s;s, knew him
at the fir&s;t glance&mdash;He now looked at me
<PB N="175" REF="175">
with a &s;tern countenance; then he ran
out into the &s;treet, to &s;ee what road the
unfortunate hor&s;eman had taken&mdash;He af|terwards
di&s;patched his man for further
intelligence, and &s;eemed to meditate &s;ome
violent de&s;ign. My uncle, being out of
order, we remained another night at the
inn; and all day long Jery acted the part
of an indefatigable &s;py upon my conduct
&mdash;He watched my very looks with &s;uch
eagerne&s;s of attention, as if he would
have penetrated into the utmo&s;t rece&s;&s;e$
of my heart&mdash;This may be owing to his
regard for my honour, if it is not the ef|fect
of his own pride; but he is &s;o hot,
and violent, and unrelenting, that the
&s;ight of him alone throws me into a flut|ter;
and really it will not be in my
power to afford him any &s;hare of my af|fection,
if he per&s;i&s;ts in per&s;ecuting me at
this rate. I am afraid he has formed
&s;ome &s;cheme of vengeance, which will
make me completely wretched! I am a|fraid
he &s;u&s;pects &s;ome collu&s;ion from
this appearance of Wil&s;on.&mdash;Good
God! did he really appear? or was it
only a phantom, a pale &s;pectre to appri&s;e
me of his death?</P>
<P>O Letty, what &s;hall I do?&mdash;where &s;hall
I turn for advice and con&s;olation?&mdash;&s;hall
<PB N="176" REF="176">
I implore the protection of my uncle,
who has been always kind and compa&s;|&s;ionate.
&mdash;This mu&s;t be my la&s;t re&s;ource.
&mdash;I dread the thoughts of making him
unea&s;y; and would rather &s;uffer a thou|&s;and

meaning of Wil&s;on's coming hither:&mdash;
perhaps, he was in que&s;t of us, in order
to di&s;clo&s;e his real name and &s;ituation:&mdash;
but wherefore pa&s;s without &s;taying to
make the lea&s;t inquiry?&mdash;My dear Wil|lis,
I am lo&s;t in conjecture.&mdash;I have not

<OPENER>To Sir WATKIN PHILLIPS, Bar^t. of
Je&s;us college, Oxon.
DEAR WATKIN,</OPENER>
<P>I YESTERDAY met with an incident
which I believe you will own to be very
&s;urpri&s;ing&mdash;As I &s;tood with Liddy at the
window of the inn where we had lodged,
who &s;hould pa&s;s by but Wil&s;on a-hor&s;e|back!
&mdash;I could not be mi&s;taken in the
per&s;on, for I had a full view of him as
he advanced; I plainly perceived by my
&s;i&s;ter's confu&s;ion that &s;he recognized him
at the $word$ time. I was equally a&s;toni&s;h|ed
and incen&s;ed at his appearance, which I
could not but interpret into an in&s;ult, or
&s;omething wor&s;e. I ran out at the gate,
and, &s;eeing him turn the corner of the
&s;treet, I di&s;patched my &s;ervant to ob&s;erve
his motions, but the fellow was too late
to bring me that &s;atisfaction. He told me,
however, that there was an inn, called the
Red Lion, at that end of the town, where
he &s;uppo&s;ed the hor&s;eman had alighted,
<PB N="179" REF="179">
but that he would not enquire without fur|ther
orders. I &s;ent him back immediate|ly
to know what &s;trangers were in the
hou&s;e, and he returned with a report that
there was one Mr. Wil&s;on lately arrived.
In con&s;equence of this information I
charged him with a note directed to that
gentleman, de&s;iring him to meet me in
half an hour in a certain field at the town's
end, with a ca&s;e of pi&s;tols, in order to
decide the difference which could not be
determined at our la&s;t rencounter: but I
did not think proper to &s;ub&s;cribe the bil|let.
My man a&s;&s;ured me he had delivered
it into his own hand; and, that having
read it, he declared he would wait upon
the gentleman at the place and time ap|pointed.</P>
<P>M`Alpine beingan old &s;oldier, and lucki|ly
&s;ober at the time, I entru&s;ted him with
my &s;ecret. I ordered him to be within call,
and, having given him a letter to be deliver|ed
to my uncle in ca&s;e of accident, I repaired
to the rendezvous, which was an inclo&s;ed
field at a little di&s;tance from the high|way.
I found my antagoni&s;t had already
taken his ground, wrapped in a dark
hor&s;eman's coat, with a laced hat flapped
over his eyes; but what was my a&s;toni&s;h|ment,
when, throwing off this wrapper,
<PB N="180" REF="180">
he appeared to be a per&s;on whom I had
never &s;een before! He had one pi&s;tol
&s;tuck in a leather belt, and another in his
hand ready for action, and, advancing a
few &s;teps, called to know if I was ready
&mdash;I an&s;wered, &startq;No,&endq; and de&s;ired a par|ley;
upon which he turned the muzzle
of his piece towards the earth; then re|placed
it in his belt, and met me half
way&mdash;When I a&s;&s;ured him he was not the
man I expected to meet he &s;aid, <HI>it might
be &s;o:</HI> that he had received a &s;lip of pa|per
directed to Mr. Wil&s;on, reque&s;ting
him to come hither; and that as there
was no other in the place of that name,
he naturally concluded the note was in|tended
for him, and him only&mdash;I then gave
him to under&s;tand, that I had been injur|ed
by a per&s;on who a&s;&s;umed that name,
which per&s;on I had actually &s;een within
the hour, pa&s;&s;ing through the &s;treet on
hor&s;eback; that hearing there was a Mr.
Wil&s;on at the Red Lion, I took it for
granted he was the man, and in that be|lief
had writ the billet; and I expre&s;&s;ed
my &s;urprize, that he, who was a &s;tranger
to me and my concerns, &s;hould give me
&s;uch a rendezvous, without taking the
trouble to demand a previous explana|nation
&mdash;He replied, that there was no
<PB N="181" REF="181">
other of his name in the whole county;
that no &s;uch hor&s;eman had alighted at the
Red Lion &s;ince nine o'clock, when he
arrived&mdash;that having had the honour to
&s;erve his maje&s;ty, he thought he could
not decently decline any invitation of this
kind, from what quarter &s;oever it might
come; and that if any explanation was
nece&s;&s;ary, it did not belong to him to de|mand
it, but to the gentleman who &s;um|moned
him into the field&mdash;Vexed as I was
at this adventure, I could not help ad|miring
the coolne&s;s of this officer, who&s;e
open countenance prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed me in his
favour.&mdash;He &s;eemed to be turned of for|ty;
wore his own &s;hort black hair, which
curled naturally about his ears, and was
very plain in his apparel&mdash;When I beg|ged
pardon for the trouble I had given
him, he received my apology with great
good humour.&mdash;He told me that he lived
about ten miles off, at a &s;mall farm hou&s;e,
which would afford me tolerable lodging,
if I would come and take the diver&s;ion of
hunting with him for a few weeks; in
which ca&s;e we might, perhaps, find out
the man who had given me offence&mdash;I
thanked him very &s;incerely for his courte|ous
offer, which, I told him, I was not
at liberty to accept at pre&s;ent, on account
<PB N="182" REF="182">
of my being engaged in a family partie;
and &s;o we parted, with mutual profe&s;&s;ions
of good will and e&s;teem.</P>
<P>Now tell me, dear knight, what am I
to make of this &s;ingular adventure?&mdash;Am
I to &s;uppo&s;e that the hor&s;eman I &s;aw was
really a thing of fle&s;h and blood, or a
bubble that vani&s;hed into air?&mdash;or mu&s;t
I imagine Liddy knows more of the mat|ter
than &s;he chu&s;es to di&s;clo&s;e?&mdash;If I
thought her capable of carrying on any
clande&s;tine corre&s;pondence with &s;uch a fel|low,
I &s;hould at once di&s;card all tender|ne&s;s,
and forget that &s;he was connected
with me by the ties of blood&mdash;But how
is it po&s;&s;ible that a girl of her &s;implicity
and inexperience, &s;hould maintain &s;uch
an intercour&s;e, &s;urrounded, as &s;he is with
&s;o many eyes, de&s;titute of all opportuni|ty,
and &s;hifting quarters every day of her
life!&mdash;Be&s;ides, &s;he has &s;olemnly promi&s;ed
&mdash;No&mdash;I can't think the girl &s;o ba&s;e&mdash;&s;o
in&s;en&s;ible to the honour of her family.&mdash;
What di&s;turbs me chiefly, is the impre&s;|&s;ion
which the&s;e occurrences &s;eem to make
upon her &s;pirits&mdash;The&s;e are the &s;ymptoms
from which I conclude that the ra&s;cal has
&s;till a hold on her affection&mdash;&s;urely I have
a right to call him a ra&s;cal, and to con|clude
<PB N="183" REF="183">
that his de&s;igns are infamous&mdash;But
it &s;hall be my fault if he does not one day
repent his pre&s;umption&mdash;I confe&s;s I
cannot think, much le&s;s write on this &s;ub|ject,
with any degree of temper or pati|ence;
I &s;hall therefore conclude with tell|ing
you, that we hope to be in Wales by
the latter end of the month: but before
that period you will probably hear again
from</P>

<OPENER>To Sir WATKIN PHILLIPS, Bar^t. at
Oxon.
DEAR PHILLIPS,</OPENER>
<P>WHEN I wrote you by la&s;t po&s;t, I
did not imagine I &s;hould be tempted to
trouble you again &s;o &s;oon: but I now &s;it
down with a heart &s;o full that it can|not
contain it&s;elf; though I am un|der
&s;uch agitation of &s;pirits, that you are
to expect either method or connexion
in this addre&s;s&mdash;We have been this day
within a hair's breadth of lo&s;ing hone&s;t
Matthew Bramble, in con&s;equence of a
cur&s;ed accident, which I will endeavour to
explain.&mdash;In cro&s;&s;ing the country to get
into the po&s;t road, it was nece&s;&s;ary to ford
a river, and we that were a-hor&s;eback
pa&s;&s;ed without any danger or difficulty;
but a great quantity of rain having fallen
la&s;t night and this morning, there was
&s;uch an accumulation of water, that a
mill-head gave way, ju&s;t as the coach was
pa&s;&s;ing under it, and the flood ru&s;hed
<PB N="185" REF="185">
down with &s;uch impetuo&s;ity, as fir&s;t float|ed,
and then fairly overturned the car|riage
in the middle of the &s;tream&mdash;Li&s;ma|hago
and I, and the two &s;ervants, al$ght|ing
in&s;tantaneou&s;ly, ran into the river to
give all the a&s;&s;i&s;tance in our power.&mdash;Our
aunt, Mrs. Tabitha, who $ad the good
fortune to be uppermo&s;t, was already
half way out of the coach window, when
her lover approaching, di&s;engaged her
entirely; but, whether his foot &s;lipt, or
the burthen was too great, they fell over
head and ears in each other's arms. He
endeavoured more than once to get up,
and even to di&s;entangle him&s;elf from her
embrace, but &s;he hung about his neck
like a mill-&s;tone (no bad emblem of ma|trimony,)
and if my man had not proved
a &s;taunch auxiliary, tho&s;e two lovers would
in all probability have gone hand in
hand to the &s;hades below&mdash;For my part,
I was too much engaged to take any cog|nizance
of their di&s;tre&s;s.&mdash;I &s;natched out
my &s;i&s;ter by the hair of the head, and,
dragging her to the bank, recollected
that my uncle had not yet appeared&mdash;
Ru&s;hing again into the &s;tream, I met
Clinker hauling a&s;hore Mrs. Jenkins, who
looked like a mermaid with her hair di|&s;hevelled
about her ears; but, when I a&s;k|ed
<PB N="186" REF="186">
if his ma&s;ter was &s;afe, he forthwith
&s;hook her from him, and &s;he mu&s;t have
gone to pot, if a miller had not &s;ea&s;on|ably
come to her relief.&mdash;As for Hum|phrey,
he flew like lightning to the coach,
that was by this time filled with water,
and, diving into it, brought up the poor
'&s;quire, to all appearance, deprived of
life&mdash;It is not in my power to de&s;cribe
what I felt at this melancholy &s;pectacle&mdash;
it was &s;uch an agony as baffles all de&s;crip|tion!
The faithful Clinker, taking him
up in his arms, as if he had been an in|fant
of &s;ix months, carried him a&s;hore,
howling mo&s;t piteou&s;ly all the way, and I
followed him in a tran&s;port of grief and
con&s;ternation&mdash;When he was laid upon
the gra&s;s, and turned from &s;ide to &s;ide,
a great quantity of water ran out at his
mouth, then he opened his eyes, and
fetched a deep &s;igh&mdash;Clinker perceiving
the&s;e &s;igns of life, immediately tied up his
arm with a garter, and, pulling out a hor&s;e|fleam,
let him blood in the farrier &s;tile.&mdash;
At fir&s;t a few drops only i&s;&s;ued from the
orifice; but the limb being chafed, in a
little time the blood began to flow in a
continued &s;tream, and he uttered &s;ome in|coherent
words, which were the mo&s;t wel|come
&s;ounds that ever &s;aluted my ear.
<PB N="187" REF="187">
There was a country inn hard by, the
landlord of which had by this time come
with his people to give their a&s;&s;i&s;tance.&mdash;
Thither my uncle being carried, was un|dre&s;&s;ed
and put to bed, wrapped in warm
blankets; but having been moved too
&s;oon, he fainted away, and once more lay
without &s;en&s;e or motion, notwith&s;tanding
all the efforts of Clinker and the land|lord,
who bathed his temples with Hun|gary
water, and held a &s;melling-bottle to
his no&s;e. As I had heard of the efficacy
of &s;alt in &s;uch ca&s;es, I ordered all that
was in the hou&s;e to be laid under his head
and body; and whether this application
had the de&s;ired effect, or nature of her&s;elf
prevailed, he, in le&s;s than a quarter of an
hour, began to breathe regularly, and
&s;oon retrieved his recollection, to the un|&s;peakable
joy of all the by-&s;tanders. As
for Clinker, his brain &s;eemed to be affect|ed.
&mdash;He laughed, and wept, and danced
about in &s;uch a di&s;tracted manner, that
the landlord very judiciou&s;ly conveyed
him out of the room. My uncle, &s;eeing
me dropping wet, comprehended the
whole of what had happened, and a&s;ked
if all the company was &s;afe?&mdash;Being an|&s;wered
in the affirmative, he in&s;i&s;ted up|on
my putting on dry clothes; and, hav|ing
<PB N="188" REF="188">
&s;wallowed a little warm wine, de&s;ired
he might be left to his repo&s;e. Before I
went to &s;hift my&s;elf, I inquired about the
re&s;t of the family&mdash;I found Mrs. Tabitha
&s;till delirious from her fright, di&s;charg|ing
very copiou&s;ly the water &s;he had &s;wal|lowed.
She was &s;upported by the cap|tain,
di&s;tilling drops from his uncurled
periwig, &s;o lank and &s;o dank, that he
looked like father Thame without his
$edges, embracing I&s;is, while &s;he ca&s;cad|ed
in his urn. Mrs. Jenkins was pre|&s;ent
al&s;o, in a loo&s;e bed-gown, without
either cap or handkerchief; but &s;he &s;eem|ed
to be as little <HI>compos mentis</HI> as her mi&s;|tre&s;s,
and acted &s;o many cro&s;s purpo&s;es
in the cour&s;e of her attendance, that, be|tween
the two, Li&s;mahago had occa&s;ion
for all his philo&s;ophy. As for Liddy, I
thought the poor girl would have actu|ally
lo&s;t her &s;en&s;es. The good-woman of
the hou&s;e had &s;hifted her linen, and put
her into bed; but &s;he was &s;eized with the
idea that her uncle had peri&s;hed, and in
this per&s;ua&s;ion made a di&s;mal out-cry;
nor did &s;he pay the lea&s;t regard to what I
&s;aid, when I &s;olemnly a&s;&s;ured her he was
&s;afe. Mr. Bramble hearing the noi&s;e, and
being informed of her apprehen&s;ion, de|&s;ired
&s;he might be brought into his cham|ber;
<PB N="189" REF="189">
and &s;he no &s;ooner received this in|timation,
than &s;he ran thither half naked,
with the wilde&s;t expre&s;&s;ion of eagerne&s;s
in her countenance&mdash;Seeing the '&s;quire
&s;itting up in the bed, &s;he &s;prung forwards,
and, throwing her arms about his neck,
exclaimed in a mo&s;t pathetic tone, &startq;Are
you&mdash;Are you indeed my uncle&mdash;My
dear uncle!&mdash;My be&s;t friend! My fa|ther!
&mdash;Are you really living? or is it
an illu&s;ion of my poor brain!&endq; Hone&s;t
Matthew was &s;o much affected, that he
could not help &s;hedding tears, while he
ki&s;&s;ed her forehead, &s;aying, &startq;My dear
Liddy, I hope I &s;hall live long enough
to &s;hew how &s;en&s;ible I am of your af|fection
&mdash;But your &s;pirits are fluttered,
child&mdash;You want re&s;t&mdash;Go to bed and
compo&s;e your&s;elf&mdash;&endq; &startq;Well, I will
(&s;he replied)&mdash;but &s;till methinks this
cannot be real&mdash;The coach was full of
water&mdash;My uncle was under us all&mdash;
Gracious God!&mdash;You was under water
&mdash;How did you get out?&mdash;tell me
that? or I &s;hall think this is all a de|ception
&mdash;&endq; &startq;In what manner I was
brought out, I know as little as you
do, my dear (&s;aid the '&s;quire); and,
truly, that is a circum&s;tance of which
I want to be informed.&endq; I would have
<PB N="190" REF="190">
given him a detail of the whole adven|ture,
but he would not hear me until I
&s;hould change my clothes; &s;o that I had
only time to tell him, that he owed his
life to the courage and fidelity of Clin|ker;
and having given him this hint, I
conducted my &s;i&s;ter to her own cham|ber.</P>
<P>This accident happened about three
o'clock in the afternoon, and in little
more than an hour the hurricane was all
over; but as the carriage was found to
be &s;o much damaged, that it could not
proceed without con&s;iderable repairs, a
black&s;mith and wheelwright were imme|diately
&s;ent for to the next market-town,
and we congratulated our&s;elves upon be|ing
hou&s;ed at an inn, which, though re|mote
from the po&s;t-road, afforded ex|ceeding
good lodging. The women be|ing
pretty well compo&s;ed, and the men
all a-foot, my uncle &s;ent for his &s;ervant,
and, in the pre&s;ence of Li&s;mahago and
me, acco&s;ted him in the&s;e words&mdash;&startq;So,
Clinker, I find you are re&s;olved I
&s;han't die by water&mdash;As you have fi&s;hed
me up from the bottom at your own
ri&s;que, you are at lea&s;t entitled to all
the money that was in my pocket, and
there it is&mdash;&endq; So &s;aying, he pre&s;ented
<PB N="191" REF="191">
him with a pur&s;e containing thirty
guineas, and a ring nearly of the &s;ame
value&mdash;&startq;God forbid! (cried Clinker)
your honour &s;hall excu&s;e me&mdash;I am a
poor fellow; but I have a heart&mdash;O!
if your honour did but know how I re|joice
to &s;ee&mdash;Ble&s;&s;ed be his holy name,
that made me the humble in&s;trument&mdash;
But as for the lucre of gain, I renounce
it&mdash;I have done no more than my duty
&mdash;No more than I would have done
for the mo&s;t worthle&s;s of my fellow|creatures
&mdash;No more than I would have
done for captain Li&s;mahago, or Archy
Macalpine, or any &s;inner upon earth&mdash;
But for your wor&s;hip, I would go
through fire as well as water&mdash;&endq; &startq;I
do believe it, Humphry (&s;aid the

&startq;Lord make me thankful

I under&s;tand your honour's looks&mdash;I
would not give offence&mdash;but my heart

When he quitted the room, Li&s;|mahago
&s;aid, he &s;hould have a much bet|ter
opinion of his hone&s;ty, if he did not
whine and cant &s;o abominably; but that
he had always ob&s;erved tho&s;e weeping and
praying fellows were hypocrites at bot|tom.
Mr. Bramble made no reply to this
&s;arca&s;tic remark, proceeding from the
lieutenant's re&s;entment of Clinker's hav|ing,
in pure &s;implicity of heart, ranked
him with M'Alpine and the &s;inners of
the earth.&mdash;The landlord being called
to receive &s;ome orders about the beds,
told the '&s;quire that his hou&s;e was very
much at his &s;ervice, but he was &s;ure he
&s;hould not have the honour to lodge him
and his company. He gave us to under|&s;tand
<PB N="193" REF="193">
that his ma&s;ter, who lived hard by,
would not &s;uffer us to be at a public
hou&s;e, when there was accommodation
for us at his own; and that, if he had
not dined abroad in the neighbourhood
he would have undoubtedly come to offer
his &s;ervices at our fir&s;t arrival. He then
launched out in prai&s;e of that gentleman,
whom he had &s;erved as butler, repre&s;ent|ing
him as a perfect miracle of goodne&s;s
and genero&s;ity. He &s;aid he was a per&s;on
of great learning, and allowed to be the
be&s;t farmer in the country:&mdash;that he had
a lady who was as much beloved as him|&s;elf,
and an only &s;on, a very hopeful
young gentleman, ju&s;t recovered from a
dangerous fever, which had like to have
proved fatal to the whole family; for, if
the &s;on had died, he was &s;ure the parents
would not have &s;urvived their lo&s;s&mdash;He
had not yet fini&s;hed the encomium of Mr.
Denni&s;on, when this gentleman arrived
in a po&s;t-chai&s;e, and his appearance &s;eem|ed
to ju&s;tify all that had been &s;aid in his
favour. He is pretty well advanced in
years, but hale, robu&s;t, and florid, with
an ingenuous countenance, expre&s;&s;ive of
good &s;en&s;e and humanity. Having con|doled
with us on the accident which had
happened, he &s;aid he was come to con|duct
<PB N="194" REF="194">
us to his habitation, where we &s;hould
be le&s;s incommoded than at &s;uch a paultry
inn, and expre&s;&s;ed his hope that the la|dies
would not be the wor&s;e for going thi|ther
in his carriage, as the di&s;tance was
not above a quarter of a mile. My
uncle having made a proper return to this
courteous exhibition, eyed him attentive|ly,
and then a&s;ked if he had not been at
Oxford, a commoner of Queen's college?
When Mr. Denni&s;on an&s;wered, &startq;Yes,&endq; with
&s;ome marks of &s;urpri&s;e&mdash;&startq;Look at me

him by the hand, and gazing at him
earne&s;tly,&mdash;&startq;I prote&s;t, (cried he,) I do

Loyd of Glamorgan&s;hire, who was &s;tu|dent

who had ju&s;t entered the room with &s;ome
coals for the fire, no &s;ooner heard the&s;e
words, than, throwing down the &s;cuttle
on the toes of Li&s;mahago, he began to
caper as if he was mad, crying&mdash;&startq;Mat|thew

Loyd of Glamorgan!&mdash;O Provi|dence!
&mdash;Matthew Loyd of Glamor|gan!&endq;

&startq;Your wor&s;hip mu&s;t forgive me&mdash;Mat|thew

Humphrey, fumbling in his bo&s;om, pull|ed
out an old wooden &s;nuff-box, which he
pre&s;ented in great trepidation to his ma&s;|ter,
who, opening it immediately, per|ceived
a &s;mall cornelian &s;eal, and two

&startq;And why were not the&s;e tokens pro|duced
before?&endq; &startq;My mother told
me &s;he had wrote to Glamorgan&s;hire,
at the time of my birth, but had no
an&s;wer; and that afterwards, when &s;he
made enquiry, there was no &s;uch per|&s;on
in that county.&endq; &startq;And &s;o in con|&s;equence
of my changing my name and
going abroad at that very time, thy
poor mother and thou have been left
to want and mi&s;ery&mdash;I am really &s;hock|ed
at the con&s;equence of my own folly.&endq;
&mdash;Then, laying his hand on Clinker's
head, he added, &startq;Stand forth, Matthew

little &s;urpri&s;ed at this di&s;covery, upon which
Mr. Denni&s;on facetiou&s;ly congratulated
both the father and the &s;on: for my part,
I &s;hook my new-found cou&s;in heartily by
the hand, and Li&s;mahago complimented
<PB N="197" REF="197">
him with the tears in his eyes, for he had
been hopping about the room, &s;wearing
in broad Scotch, and bellowing with the
pain occa&s;ioned by the fall of the coal-&s;cuttle
upon his foot. He had even vow|ed
to drive the <HI>&s;aul</HI> out of the body of
that mad ra&s;cal: but, perceiving the un|expected
turn which things had taken, he
wi&s;hed him joy of his good fortune, ob|&s;erving
that it went very near his heart,
as he was like to be a great toe out of
pocket by the di&s;covery&mdash;Mr Denni&s;on
now de&s;ired to know for what rea&s;on my
uncle had changed the name by which he
knew him at Oxford, and our '&s;quire &s;a|tisfied
him, by an&s;wering to this effect.&mdash;
&startq;I took my mother's name, which was
Loyd, as heir to her lands in Glamor|gan&s;hire;
but, when I came of age, I
&s;old that property, in order to clear my
paternal e&s;tate, and re&s;umed my real
name; &s;o that I am now Matthew
Bramble of Brambleton-hall in Mon|mouth&s;hire,
at your &s;ervice; and this
is my nephew, Jeremy Melford of Bel|field,
in the county of Glamorgan.&endq;
At that in&s;tant the ladies entering the
room, he pre&s;ented Mrs. Tabitha as his
&s;i&s;ter, and Liddy as his niece. The old
gentleman &s;aluted them very cordially,
<PB N="198" REF="198">
and &s;eemed &s;truck with the appearance of
my &s;i&s;ter, whom he could not help &s;ur|veying

this time dropt upon one knee, by the
&s;ide of Mrs. Tabitha, who, eyeing him
a&s;kance, and flirting her fan with marks
of agitation, thought proper, after &s;ome
conflict, to hold out her hand for him
to ki&s;s, &s;aying, with a demure a&s;pect,
&startq;Brother, you have been very wicked:

got the trick of the eye, and the tip of
the no&s;e of my uncle Loyd of Flluy|dwellyn;

&s;eemed much plea&s;ed with this acqui&s;ition
to the family.&mdash;She took him by the hand,
declaring &s;he &s;hould always be proud to
own her connexion with a virtuous young
man, who had given &s;o many proofs of
his gratitude and affection to her uncle.&mdash;
Mrs. Winifred Jenkins extremely flut|tered
between her &s;urprize at this di&s;co|very,

&s;weet-heart, exclaimed in a giggling tone,

<OPENER>To Dr. LEWIS.
DEAR DICK,</OPENER>
<P>SINCE the la&s;t trouble I gave you, I
have met with a variety of incidents, &s;ome
of them of a &s;ingular nature, which I re|&s;erve
as a fund for conver&s;ation; but there
are others &s;o intere&s;ting, that they will
not keep in <HI>petto</HI> till meeting.</P>
<P>Know then, it was a thou&s;and pounds
to a &s;ixpence, that you &s;hould now be ex|ecuting
my will, in&s;tead of peru&s;ing my
letter! Two days ago, our coach was
overturned in the mid&s;t of a rapid river,
where my life was &s;aved with the utmo&s;t
difficulty, by the courage, activity, and
pre&s;ence of mind of my &s;ervant Humphry
Clinker&mdash;But this is not the mo&s;t &s;ur|pri&s;ing
circum&s;tance of the adventure&mdash;
The &s;aid Humphry Clinker proves to be
Ma$thew Loyd, $word$ &s;on of one Mat|thew
Loyd of $word$, if you know
any &s;uch per&s;on&mdash;You &s;ee, Doctor, that
<PB N="202" REF="202">
notwith&s;tanding all your philo&s;ophy, it is
not without &s;ome rea&s;on that we Welch|men
a&s;cribe &s;uch energy to the force of
blood&mdash;But we &s;hall di&s;cu&s;s this point on
&s;ome future occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>This is not the only di&s;covery which I
made in con&s;equence of our di&s;a&s;ter&mdash;
We happened to be wrecked upon a
friendly &s;hore&mdash;The lord of the manor
is no other than Charles Denni&s;on, our
fellow-rake at Oxford&mdash;We are now hap|pily
hou&s;ed with that gentleman, who has
really attained to that pitch of rural feli|city,
at which I have been a&s;piring the&s;e
twenty years in vain. He is ble&s;&s;ed with
a con&s;ort, who&s;e di&s;po&s;ition is &s;uited to
his own in all re&s;pects; tender, generous,
and benevolent&mdash;She, moreover, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es
an uncommon &s;hare of under&s;tanding,
fortitude, and di&s;cretion, and is admir|ably
qualified to be his companion, con|fidant,
coun&s;ellor, and coadjutrix. The&s;e
excellent per&s;ons have an only &s;on, about
nineteen years of age, ju&s;t &s;uch a youth
as they could have wi&s;hed that Heaven
would be&s;tow to fill up the mea&s;ure of
their enjoyment&mdash;In a word, they know
no other allay to their happine&s;s, but their
apprehen&s;ion and anxiety about the life
and concerns of this beloved object.</P>
<P><PB N="203" REF="203">
Our old friend, who had the misfor|tune
to be a &s;econd brother, was bred to
the law, and even called to the bar; but
he did not find him&s;elf qualified to &s;hine
in that province, and had very little in|clination
for his profe&s;&s;ion&mdash;He di&s;obliged
his father, by marrying for love, with|out
any con&s;ideration of fortune; &s;o that
he had little or nothing to depend upon
for &s;ome years but his practice, which af|forded
him a bare &s;ub&s;i&s;tence; and
the pro&s;pect of an increa&s;ing family, be|gan
to give him di&s;turbance and di&s;quiet.
In the mean time, his father dying, was
&s;ucceeded by his elder brother, a fox-hunter
and a &s;ot, who neglected his af|fairs,
in&s;ulted and oppre&s;&s;ed his &s;ervants,
and in a few years had well nigh$ ruined
the e&s;tate, when he was happily carried
off by a fever, the immediate con&s;equence
of a debauch. Charles, with the appro|bation
of his wife, immediately deter|mined
to quit bu&s;ine&s;s, and retire into the
country, although this re&s;olution was
&s;trenuou&s;ly and zealou&s;ly oppo&s;ed by every
individual, whom he con&s;ulted on the
&s;ubject. Tho&s;e who had tried the expe|riment,
a&s;&s;ured him that he could not pre|tend
to breathe in the country for le&s;s than
the double of what his e&s;tate produced;
<PB N="204" REF="204">
that, in order to be upon the footing of a
gentleman, he would be obliged to keep
hor&s;es, hounds, carriages, with a &s;uitable
number of &s;ervants, and maintain an ele|gant
table for the entertainment of his
neighbours; that farming was a my&s;tery,
known only to tho&s;e who had been bred
up to it from the cradle, the &s;ucce&s;s of it
depending not only upon &s;kill and indu&s;|try,
but al&s;o upon &s;uch attention and
oeconomy as no gentleman could be &s;up|po&s;ed
to give or practi&s;e; accordingly,
every attempt made by gentlemen mi&s;|carried,
and not a few had been ruined
by their pro&s;ecution of agriculture&mdash;Nay,
they affirmed that he would find it cheap|er
to buy hay and oats for his cattle, and
to go to market for poultry, eggs, kitchen
herbs, and roots, and every the mo&s;t in|con&s;iderable
article of hou&s;e-keeping,
than to have tho&s;e articles produced on
his own ground.</P>
<P>The&s;e objections did not deter Mr.
Denni&s;on, becau&s;e they were chiefly
founded on the &s;uppo&s;ition, that he would
be obliged to lead a life of extravagance
and di&s;&s;ipation, which he and his con&s;ort
equally dete&s;ted, de&s;pi&s;ed, and determin|ed
to avoid&mdash;The objects he had in view,
were health of body, peace of mind, and
<PB N="205" REF="205">
the private &s;atisfaction of dome&s;tic quiet,
unallayed by actual want, and uninter|rupted
by the fears of indigence&mdash;He was
very moderate in his e&s;timate of the ne|ce&s;&s;aries,
and even of the comforts of life
&mdash;He required nothing but whole&s;ome
air, pure water, agreeable exerci&s;e, plain
diet, convenient lodging, and decent ap|parel.
He reflected, that if a pea&s;ant
without education, or any great &s;hare of
natural &s;agacity, could maintain a large
family, and even become opulent upon a
farm, for which he payed an annual rent
of two or three hundred pounds to the
landlord, &s;urely he him&s;elf might hope
for &s;ome &s;ucce&s;s from his indu&s;try, having
no rent to pay, but, on the contrary,
three or four hundred pounds a-year to
receive&mdash;He con&s;idered, that the earth
was an indulgent mother, that yielded her
fruits to all her children without di&s;tinc|tion.
He had &s;tudied the theory of agri|culture
with a degree of eagerne&s;s and de|light;
and he could not conceive there
was any my&s;tery in the practice, but
what he &s;hould be able to di&s;clo&s;e by dint
of care and application. With re&s;pect to
hou&s;hold expence, he entered into a mi|nute
detail and inve&s;tigation, by which
he perceived the a&s;&s;ertions of his friends
<PB N="206" REF="206">
were altogether erroneous&mdash;He found he
&s;hould &s;ave &s;ixty pounds a-year in the
&s;ingle article of hou&s;e-rent, and as much
more in pocket-money and contingen|cies;
that even butcher's-meat was twen|ty
per cent. cheaper in the country that
in London; but that poultry, and almo&s;t
every other circum&s;tance of hou&s;e-keep|ing,
might be had for le&s;s than one half
of what they co&s;t in town; be&s;ides, a con|&s;iderable
&s;aving on the &s;ide of dre&s;s, in
being delivered from the oppre&s;&s;ive im|po&s;ition
of ridiculous modes, invented
by ignorance, and adopted by folly.</P>
<P>As to the danger of vying with the
rich in pomp and equipage, it never gave
him the lea&s;t di&s;turbance. He was now
turned of forty, and, having lived half
that time in the bu&s;y &s;cenes of life, was
well &s;killed in the &s;cience of mankind.
There cannot be in nature a more con|temptible
figure than that of a man, who
with five hundred a year pre&s;umes to ri|val
in expence a neighbour who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es
five times that income&mdash;His o&s;tentation,
far from concealing, &s;erves only to di&s;co|ver
his indigence, and render his vanity
the more &s;hocking; for it attracts the
eyes of cen&s;ure, and excites the &s;pirit of
inquiry. There is not a family in the
<PB N="207" REF="207">
county, nor a &s;ervant in his own hou&s;e,
nor a farmer in the pari&s;h, but what
knows the utmo&s;t farthing that his lands
produce, and all the&s;e behold him with
&s;corn or compa&s;&s;ion. I am &s;urpri&s;ed that
the&s;e reflections do not occur to per&s;ons
in this unhappy dilemma, and produce a
&s;alutary effect; but the truth is, of all the
pa&s;&s;ions incident to human nature, vani|ty
is that which mo&s;t effectually perverts
the faculties of the under&s;tanding; nay,
it &s;ometimes becomes &s;o incredibly de|praved,
as to a&s;pire at infamy, and find
plea&s;ure in bearing the &s;tigmas of re|proach.</P>
<P>I have now given you a &s;ketch of the
character and &s;ituation of Mr. Denni&s;on,
when he came down to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of
this e&s;tate; but as the me&s;&s;enger, who
carries the letters to the next town is ju&s;t

<PB N="208" REF="208">
<OPENER>To Dr. LEWIS.</OPENER>
<P>ONCE more, dear doctor, I re&s;ume
the pen for your amu&s;ement.&mdash;It was on
the morning after our arrival that, walk|ing
out with my friend, Mr. Denni&s;on,
I could not help breaking forth into the
warme&s;t expre&s;&s;ions of applau&s;e at the
beauty of the &s;cene, which is really in|chanting;
and I &s;ignified, in particular,
how much I was plea&s;ed with the di&s;po&s;i|tion
of &s;ome detached groves, that afford|ed
at once &s;helter and ornament to his ha|bitation.</P>
<P>&startq;When I took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the&s;e
lands, about two and twenty years ago,
(&s;aid he) there was not a tree &s;tanding
within a mile of the hou&s;e, except
tho&s;e of an old neglected orchard,
which produced nothing but leaves and
mo&s;s.&mdash;It was in the gloomy month of
November, when I arrived, and found
the hou&s;e in &s;uch a condition, that it
might have been ju&s;tly &s;tiled the <HI>tower
of de&s;olation.</HI>&mdash;The court-yard was co|vered
<PB N="209" REF="209">
with nettles and docks, and the
garden exhibited &s;uch a rank plantation
of weeds as I had never &s;een before;&mdash;
the window-&s;hutters were falling in
pieces;&mdash;the &s;a&s;hes broken;&mdash;and
owls and jack-daws had taken po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion
of the chimnies.&mdash;The pro&s;pect
within was &s;till more dreary.&mdash;All was
dark, and damp, and dirty beyond
de&s;cription;&mdash;the rain penetrated in
&s;everal parts of the roof;&mdash;in &s;ome
apartments the very floors had given
way;&mdash;the hangings were parted from
the walls, and &s;haking in mouldy rem|nants;
&mdash;the gla&s;&s;es were dropping
out of their frames;&mdash;the family-pic|tures
were covered with du&s;t;&mdash;and all
the chairs and tables worm-eaten and
crazy.&mdash;There was not a bed in the
hou&s;e that could be u&s;ed, except one
old-fa&s;hioned machine, with a high-gilt
te&s;ter, and fringed curtains of yellow
mohair, which had been, for aught I
know, two centuries in the fami|ly.
&mdash;In &s;hort, there was no furniture
but the uten&s;ils of the kitchen; and
the cellar afforded nothing but a few
empty butts and barrels, that &s;tunk &s;o
abominably, that I would not &s;uffer
any body to enter it until I had fla&s;hed
<PB N="210" REF="210">
a con&s;iderable quantity of gun-powder
to qualify the foul air within.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;An old cottager and his wife, who
were hired to lie in the hou&s;e, had left
it with precipitation, alledging, among
other cau&s;es of retreat, that they could
not &s;leep for frightful noi&s;es, and that
my poor brother certainly walked after
his death.&mdash;In a word, the hou&s;e ap|peared
uninhabitable; the barn, &s;table,
and out-hou&s;es were in ruins; all the
fences broken down, and the fields ly|ing
wa&s;te.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;The farmer who kept the key never
dreamed I had any intention to live
upon the &s;pot.&mdash;He rented a farm of
&s;ixty pounds, and his lea&s;e was ju&s;t
expiring.&mdash;He had formed a &s;cheme
of being appointed bailiff to the e&s;tate,
and of converting the hou&s;e and the
adjacent grounds to his own u&s;e.&mdash;A
hint of his intention I received from
the curate at my fir&s;t arrival; I there|fore
did not pay much regard to what
he &s;aid by way of di&s;couraging me
from coming to &s;ettle in the country;
but I was a little &s;tartled when he gave
me warning that he &s;hould quit the
farm at the expiration of his lea&s;e, un|le&s;s
<PB N="211" REF="211">
I would abate con&s;iderably in the
rent.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;At this period I accidentally became
acquainted with a per&s;on, who&s;e friend|&s;hip
laid the foundation of all my pro|&s;perity.
In the next market-town, I
chanced to dine at an inn with a Mr.
Wil&s;on, who was lately come to &s;ettle
in the neighbourhood.&mdash;He had been
lieutenant of a man of war: but quit|ted
the &s;ea in &s;ome di&s;gu&s;t, and mar|ried
the only daughter of farmer Bland,
who lives in this pari&s;h, and has ac|quired
a good fortune in the way of
hu&s;bandry.&mdash;Wil&s;on is one of the be&s;t
natured men I ever knew; brave,
frank, obliging, and ingenuous.&mdash;He
liked my conver&s;ation, I was charmed
with his liberal manner; an acquain|tance
immediately commenced, and
this was &s;oon improved into a friend|&s;hip
without re&s;erve.&mdash;There are cha|racters
which, like &s;imilar particles of
matter, &s;trongly attract each other.&mdash;
He forthwith introduced me to his fa|ther-in-law,
farmer Bland, who was
well acquainted with every acre of my
e&s;tate, of con&s;equence well qualified
to advi&s;e me on this occa&s;ion.&mdash;Find|ing
<PB N="212" REF="212">
I was inclined to embrace a coun|try
life, and even to amu&s;e my&s;elf with
the occupations of farming, he approv|ed
of my de&s;ign&mdash;He gave me to un|der&s;tand
that all my farms were under|lett;
that the e&s;tate was capable of
great improvement; that there was
plenty of chalk in the neighbourhood;
and that my own ground produced ex|cellent
marle for manure.&mdash;With re|&s;pect
to the farm, which was like to
fall into my hands, he &s;aid he would
willingly take it at the pre&s;ent rent;
but at the &s;ame time owned, that if I
would expend two hundred pounds in
enclo&s;ure, it would be worth more than
double the &s;um.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Thus encouraged, I began the exe|cution
of my &s;cheme without further
delay, and plunged into a &s;ea of ex|pence,
though I had no fund in re&s;erve,
and the whole produce of the e&s;tate
did not exceed three hundred pounds
a year.&mdash;In one week, my hou&s;e was
made weather-tight, and thoroughly
clean&s;ed from top to bottom; then it
was well ventilated by throwing all the
doors and windows open, and making
blazing fires of wood in every chimney
from the kitchen to the garrets.&mdash;The
<PB N="213" REF="213">
floors were repaired, the &s;a&s;hes new glaz|ed,
and out of the old furniture of the
whole hou&s;e, I made &s;hift to &s;it up a
parlour and three chambers in a plain
yet decent manner.&mdash;The court-yard
was cleared of weeds and rubbi&s;h, and
my friend Wil&s;on charged him&s;elf with
the dre&s;&s;ing of the garden; bricklayers
were &s;et at work upon the barn and
&s;table; and labourers engaged to re|&s;tore
the fences, and begin the work
of hedging and ditching, under the di|rection
of farmer Bland, at who&s;e re|commendation
I hired a careful hind
to lie in the hou&s;e, and keep con&s;tant
fires in the apartments.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Having taken the&s;e mea&s;ures, I re|turned
to London, where I forthwith
&s;old off my hou&s;hold-furniture, and, in
three weeks from my fir&s;t vi&s;it, brought
my wife hither to keep her Chri&s;t|mas.
&mdash;Con&s;idering the gloomy
&s;ea&s;on of the year, the drearine&s;s of the
place, and the decayed a&s;pect of our
habitation, I was afraid that her re&s;olu|tion
would &s;ink under the &s;udden tran&s;|ition
from a town-life to &s;uch a melan|choly
&s;tate of ru&s;tication; but I was
agreeably di&s;appointed.&mdash;She found
the reality le&s;s uncomfortable than the
<PB N="214" REF="214">
picture I had drawn.&mdash;By this time,
indeed, things were mended in appear|ance.
&mdash;The out-hou&s;es had ri&s;en out of
their ruins; the pigeon-hou&s;e was re|built,
and repleni&s;hed by Wil&s;on, who
al&s;o put my garden in decent order,
and provided a good &s;tock of poultry,
which made an agreeable figure in my
yard; and the hou&s;e, on the whole,
looked like the habitation of human
creatures.&mdash;Farmer Bland &s;pared me a
milch-cow for my family, and an ordi|nary
&s;addle-hor&s;e for my &s;ervant to go
to market at the next town.&mdash;I hired a
country lad for a footman; the hind's
daughter was my hou&s;e-maid, and my
wife had brought a cook-maid from
London.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Such was my family when I began
hou&s;e-keeping in this place, with three
hundred pounds in my pocket, rai&s;ed
from the &s;ale of my &s;uperfluous furni|ture
&mdash;I knew we &s;hould find occupa|tion
enough through the day to employ
our time; but I dreaded the long win|ter
evenings; yet for the&s;e too we
found a remedy.&mdash;The curate, who
was a &s;ingle man, &s;oon became &s;o natu|ralized
to the family, that he generally
lay in the hou&s;e; and his company
<PB N="215" REF="215">
was equally agreeable and u&s;eful.&mdash;He
was a mode&s;t man, a good &s;cholar, and
perfectly well qualified to in&s;truct me
in &s;uch country matters as I wanted to
know.&mdash;Mr. Wil&s;on brought his wife
to &s;ee us, and &s;he became &s;o fond of
Mrs. Denni&s;on, that &s;he &s;aid &s;he was
never &s;o happy as when &s;he enjoyed the
benefit of her conver&s;ation.&mdash;She was
then a fine buxom country la&s;s, ex|ceedingly
docile, and as good-natured
as her hu&s;band Jack Wil&s;on; &s;o that a
friend&s;hip en&s;ued among the women,
which hath continued to this day.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;As for Jack, he hath been my con|&s;tant
companion, coun&s;ellor, and com|mi&s;&s;ary.
&mdash;I would not for a hundred
pounds you &s;hould leave my hou&s;e
without &s;eeing him.&mdash;Jack is an uni|ver&s;al
genius&mdash;his talents are really
a&s;toni&s;hing&mdash;He is an excellent car|penter,
joiner, and turner, and a cun|ning
arti&s;t in iron and bra&s;s.&mdash;He not
only &s;uperintended my oeconomy, but
al&s;o pre&s;ided over my pa&s;times.&mdash;He
taught me to brew beer, to make cyder,
perry, mead, u&s;quebaugh, and plague-water;
to cook &s;everal outlandi&s;h deli|cacies,
&s;uch as <HI>ollas, pepper pots, pillaws,
corys, chabobs,</HI> and <HI>&s;tufatas.</HI>&mdash;He under|&s;tands
<PB N="216" REF="216">
all manner of games from che&s;s
down to chuck-farthing, &s;ings a good
&s;ong, plays upon the violin, and
dances a hornpipe with &s;urpri&s;ing agili|ty.
&mdash;He and I walked, and rode, and
hunted, and fi&s;hed together, without
minding the vici&s;&s;itudes of the weather;
and I am per&s;uaded, that in a raw,
moi&s;t climate, like this of England,
continual exerci&s;e is as nece&s;&s;ary as food
to the pre&s;ervation of the individual.&mdash;
In the cour&s;e of two and twenty years,
there has not been one hour's interrup|tion
or abatement in the friend&s;hip &s;ub|&s;i&s;ting
between Wil&s;on's family and
mine; and, what is a rare in&s;tance of
good fortune, that friend&s;hip is conti|nued
to our children.&mdash;His &s;on and
mine are nearly of the &s;ame age and the
&s;ame di&s;po&s;ition; they have been bred
up together at the &s;ame &s;chool and
college, and love each other with the
warme&s;t affection.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;By Wil&s;on's means, I likewi&s;e form|ed
an acquaintance with a &s;en&s;ible phy|&s;ician,
who lives in the next market-town;
and his &s;i&s;ter, an agreeable old
maiden, pa&s;&s;ed the Chri&s;tmas holidays
at our hou&s;e.&mdash;Mean while I began my
farming with great eagerne&s;s, and that
<PB N="217" REF="217">
very winter planted the&s;e groves that
plea&s;e you &s;o much.&mdash;As for the neigh|bouring
gentry, I had no trouble from
that quarter during my fir&s;t campaign;
they were all gone to town before I
&s;ettled in the country; and by the
&s;ummer I had taken mea&s;ures to defend
my&s;elf from their attacks.&mdash;When a
gay equipage came to my gates, I was
never at home; tho&s;e who vi&s;ited me
in a mode&s;t way, I received; and ac|cording
to the remarks I made on their
characters and conver&s;ation, either re|jected
their advances, or returned their
civility.&mdash;I was in general de&s;pi&s;ed
among the fa&s;hionable company, as a
low fellow, both in breeding and cir|cum&s;tances;
neverthele&s;s, I found a few
individuals of moderate fortune, who
gladly adopted my &s;tile of living;
and many others would have acceded
to our &s;ociety, had they not been pre|vented
by the pride, envy, and ambition
of their wives and daughters.&mdash;Tho&s;e,
in times of luxury and di&s;&s;ipation, are
the rocks upon which all the &s;mall
e&s;tates in the country are wrecked.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I re&s;erved in my own hands, &s;ome
acres of ground adjacent to the hou&s;e,
for making experiments in agriculture,
according to the directions of Lyle,
<PB N="218" REF="218">
Tull, Hart, Duhamel, and others who
have written on this &s;ubject; and qua|lified
their theory with the practical ob|&s;ervations
of farmer Bland, who was
my great ma&s;ter in the art of hu&s;ban|dry.
&mdash;In &s;hort, I became enamoured
of a country life; and my &s;ucce&s;s
greatly exceeded my expectation.&mdash;
I drained bogs, burned heath, grubbed
up furze and fern; I planted cop&s;e and
willows where nothing el&s;e would grow;
I gradually inclo&s;ed all my farms, and
made &s;uch improvements, that my
e&s;tate now yields me clear twelve hun|dred
pounds a year.&mdash;All this time
my wife and I have enjoyed unin|terrupted
health, and a regular flow of
&s;pirits, except on a very few occa&s;ions,
when our chearfulne&s;s was invaded by
&s;uch accidents as are in&s;eparable from
the condition of life.&mdash;I lo&s;t two chil|dren
in their infancy, by the &s;mall-pox,
&s;o that I have one &s;on only, in whom
all our hopes are centred.&mdash;He went
ye&s;terday to vi&s;it a friend, with whom
he has &s;tayed all night, but he will be
here to dinner.&mdash;I &s;hall this day have
the plea&s;ure of pre&s;enting him to you
and your family; and I flatter my&s;elf
you will find him not altogether un|worthy
of our affection.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="219" REF="219">
&startq;The truth is, either I am blinded by
the partiality of a parent, or he is a boy
of a very amiable character; and yet
his conduct has given us un&s;peakable
di&s;quiet.&mdash;You mu&s;t know, we had
projected a match between him and a
gentleman's daughter in the next coun|ty,
who will in all probability be heire&s;s
of a con&s;iderable fortune; but, it
&s;eems, he had a per&s;onal di&s;gu&s;t to the
alliance.&mdash;He was then at Cambridge,
and tried to gain time on various pre|tences;
but being pre&s;&s;ed in letters by
his mother and me to give a definitive
an&s;wer, he fairly gave his tutor the &s;lip,
and di&s;appeared about eight months
ago.&mdash;Before he took this ra&s;h &s;tep, he
wrote me a letter, explaining his objec|tions
to the match, and declaring, that
he would keep him&s;elf concealed until
he &s;hould under&s;tand that his parents
would di&s;pen&s;e with his contracting an
engagement that mu&s;t make him mi|&s;erable
for life, and he pre&s;cribed the
form of adverti&s;ing in a certain news|paper,
by which he might be apprized
of our &s;entiments on this &s;ubject.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;You may ea&s;ily conceive how much we
were alarmed and afflicted by this elope|ment,
which he had made without drop|ping
<PB N="220" REF="220">
the lea&s;t hint to his companion
Charles Wil&s;on, who belonged to the
&s;ame college.&mdash;We re&s;olved to puni&s;h
him with the appearance of neglect, in
hopes that he would return of his own
accord; but he maintained his purpo&s;e
till the young lady cho&s;e a partner for
her&s;elf; then he produced him&s;elf,
and made his peace by the mediation
of Wil&s;on.&mdash;Suppo&s;e we &s;hould unite
our families by joining him with your
niece, who is one of the mo&s;t lovely
creatures I ever beheld.&mdash;My wife is
already as fond of her as if &s;he were
her own child, and I have a pre&s;enti|ment
that my &s;on will be captivated by
her at fir&s;t &s;ight.&endq; &startq;Nothing could
be more agreeable to all our family
(&s;aid I) than &s;uch an alliance; but,
my dear friend, candour obliges me to
tell you, that I am afraid Liddy's heart
is not wholly di&s;engaged&mdash;there is a
cur&s;ed ob&s;tacle&mdash;&endq; &startq;You mean
the young &s;troller at Glouce&s;ter (&s;aid
he)&mdash;You are &s;urpri&s;ed that I &s;hould
know this circum&s;tance; but you will
be more &s;urpri&s;ed when I tell you that
&s;troller is no other than my &s;on George
Denni&s;on&mdash;That was the character he
a&s;&s;umed in his eclip&s;e.&endq; &startq;I am, in|deed,
<PB N="221" REF="221">
a&s;toni&s;hed and overjoyed, (cried
I) and &s;hall be happy beyond expre&s;|&s;ion
to &s;ee your propo&s;al take effect.&endq;</P>
<P>He then gave me to under&s;tand that
the young gentleman, at his emerging
from concealment, had di&s;clo&s;ed his pa&s;|&s;ion
for Mi&s;s Melford, the niece of Mr.
Bramble of Monmouth&s;hire. Though
Mr. Denni&s;on little dreamed that this was
his old friend Matthew Loyd, he neverthe|le&s;s
furni&s;hed his &s;on with proper creden|tials,
and he had been at Bath, London, and
many other places in que&s;t of us, to make
him&s;elf and his preten&s;ions known.&mdash;The
bad &s;ucce&s;s of his enquiry had &s;uch an
effect upon his &s;pirits, that immediately at
his return he was &s;eized with a dangerous
fever, which overwhelmed his parents
with terror and affliction; but he was
now happily recovered, though &s;till weak
and di&s;con&s;olate. My nephew joining us
in our walk, I informed him of the&s;e cir|cum&s;tances,
with which he was wonder|fully
plea&s;ed. He declared he would pro|mote
the match to the utmo&s;t of his power,
and that he longed to embrace young Mr.
Denni&s;on as his friend and brother.&mdash;Mean
while, the father went to de&s;ire his wife
to communicate this di&s;covery gradually
to Liddy, that her delicate nerves might
not &s;uffer too &s;udden a &s;hock; and I
<PB N="222" REF="222">
imparted the particulars to my &s;i&s;ter Tab|by,
who expre&s;&s;ed &s;ome &s;urprize, not alto|gether
unmixed, I believe, with an emo|tion
of envy; for, though &s;he could have
no objection to an alliance at once &s;o ho|nourable
and advantageous, &s;he he&s;itated
in giving her con&s;ent, on pretence of the
youth and inexperience of the parties: at
length, however, &s;he acquie&s;ced, in con&s;e|quence
of having con&s;ulted with captain
Li&s;mahago.</P>
<P>Mr. Denni&s;on took care to be in the
way when his &s;on aarrived at the gate,
and, without giving him time or oppor|tunity
to make any enquiry about the
&s;trangers, brought him up &s;tairs to be
pre&s;ented to Mr. Loyd and his family&mdash;
The fir&s;t per&s;on he &s;aw, when he entered
the room, was Liddy, who, notwith&s;tanding
all her preparation, &s;tood trembling in the
utmo&s;t confu&s;ion&mdash;At &s;ight of this object
he was fixed motionle&s;s to the floor, and,
gazing at her with the utmo&s;t eagerne&s;s of
a&s;toni&s;hment, exclaimed, &startq;Sacred hea|ven!
what is this!&mdash;ha! wherefore&mdash;.&endq;
Here his &s;peech failing, he &s;tood &s;training
his eyes, in the mo&s;t emphatic &s;ilence&mdash;
&startq;George (&s;aid his father) this is my
friend Mr. Loyd.&endq; Rou&s;ed at this
intimation, he turned and received my
&s;alute, when I &s;aid, &startq;Young gentleman,
<PB N="223" REF="223">
if you had tru&s;ted me with your &s;ecret
at our la&s;t meeting, we &s;hould have
parted upon better terms.&endq; Before he
could make any an&s;wer, Jery came round
and &s;tood before him with open arms.&mdash;
At fir&s;t, he &s;tarted and changed colour;
but after a &s;hort pau&s;e, he ru&s;hed into his
embrace, and they hugged one another as
if they had been intimate friends from
their infancy: then he payed his re&s;pects
to Mrs. Tabitha, and advancing to Lid|dy,
&startq;Is it po&s;&s;ible, (cried he) that my
&s;en&s;es do not play me fal&s;e!&mdash;that I &s;ee
Mi&s;s Melford under my father's roof&mdash;
that I am permitted to &s;peak to her
without giving offence&mdash;and that her
relations have honoured me with their
countenance and protection.&endq; Liddy
blu&s;hed, and trembled, and faultered&mdash;
&startq;To be &s;ure, &s;ir, (&s;aid &s;he) it is a very
&s;urpri&s;ing circum&s;tance&mdash;a great&mdash;
a providential&mdash;I really know not
what I &s;ay&mdash;but I beg you will think
I have &s;aid what's agreeable.&endq;</P>
<P>Mrs. Denni&s;on interpo&s;ing &s;aid, &startq;Com|po&s;e
your&s;elves, my dear children.&mdash;
Your mutual happine&s;s &s;hall be our
peculiar care.&endq; The &s;on going up to
his mother, ki&s;&s;ed one hand; my niece
bathed the other with her tears; and the
good old lady pre&s;&s;ed them both in their
<PB N="224" REF="224">
turns to her brea&s;t.&mdash;The lovers were too
much affected to get rid of their embar|ra&s;&s;ment
for one day; but the &s;cene was
much enlivened by the arrival of Jack
Wil&s;on, who brought, as u&s;ual, &s;ome
game of his own killing.&mdash;His hone&s;t
countenance was a good letter of recom|mendation.
&mdash;I received him like a dear
friend after a long &s;eparation; and I could
not help wondering to &s;ee him &s;hake Jery
by the hand as an old acquaintance.&mdash;
They had, indeed, been acquainted &s;ome
days, in con&s;equence of a diverting inci|dent,
which I &s;hall explain at meeting.&mdash;
That &s;ame night a con&s;ultation was held
upon the concerns of the lovers, when the
match was formally agreed to, and all the
marriage-articles were &s;ettled without the
lea&s;t di&s;pute.&mdash;My nephew and I pro|mi&s;ed
to make Liddy's fortune five thou|&s;and
pounds. Mr. Denni&s;on declared,
he would make over one half of his e&s;tate

that, con&s;idering their youth, they
&s;hould undergo one year at lea&s;t of proba|tion

<P>As the law requires that the parties
&s;hould be &s;ome weeks re&s;ident in the pa|ri&s;h,
we &s;hall &s;tay here till the ceremony is

will be publi&s;hed for all four together.&mdash;

<OPENER>To Sir WATKIN PHILLIPS, Bar^t. at
Oxon.
DEAR WAT,</OPENER>
<P>EVERY day is now big with incident
and di&s;covery&mdash;Young Mr. Denni&s;on
proves to be no other than that identical
per&s;on whom I have execrated &s;o long, un|der
the name of Wil&s;on&mdash;He had eloped
from college at Cambridge, to avoid a
match that he dete&s;ted, and acted in dif|ferent
parts of the country as a &s;troller,
until the lady in que&s;tion made choice of
a hu&s;band for her&s;elf; then he returned
to his father, and di&s;clo&s;ed his pa&s;&s;ion for
Liddy, which met with the approbation
of his parents, though the father little
imagined that Mr. Bramble was his old
companion Matthew Loyd. The young
gentleman, being impowered to make ho|nourable
propo&s;als to my uncle and me,
had been in &s;earch of us all over Eng|land,
<PB N="227" REF="227">
without effect; and he it was whom
I had &s;een pa&s;s on hor&s;eback by the win|dow
of the inn, where I &s;tood with my
&s;i&s;ter, but he little dreamed that we were
in the hou&s;e&mdash;As for the real Mr. Wil&s;on,
whom I called forth to combat, by mi&s;|take,
he is the neighbour and inti|mate
$riend of old Mr. Denni&s;on, and
this connexion had &s;ugge&s;ted to the &s;on
the idea of taking that name while he re|mained
in ob&s;urity.</P>
<P>You may ea&s;ily conceive what plea&s;ure
I mu&s;t have felt on di&s;covering that the
honour of our family was in no danger
from the conduct of a &s;i&s;ter, whom I love
with uncommon affection; that, in&s;tead
of deba&s;ing her &s;entiments and views to a
wretched &s;troller, &s;he had really capti|vated
the heart of a gentleman, her equal
in rank and &s;uperior in fortune; and that,
as his parents approved of his attach|ment,
I was on the eve of acquiring a
brother-in-law &s;o worthy of my friend&s;hip
and e&s;teem. George Denni&s;on is, with|out
all que&s;tion, one of the mo&s;t accom|pli&s;hed
young fellows in England. His
per&s;on is at once elegant and manly, and
his under&s;tanding highly cultivated. Tho'
his &s;pirit is lofty, his heart is kind; and
<PB N="228" REF="228">
his manner &s;o engaging, as to command
veneration and love, even from malice
and indifference. When I weigh my own
character with his, I am a&s;hamed to find
my&s;elf &s;o light in the balance; but the
compari&s;on excites no envy&mdash;I propo&s;e
him as a model for imitation&mdash;I have
endeavoured to recommend my&s;elf to his
friend&s;hip, and hope I have already found
a place in his affection. I am, however,
mortified to reflect what flagrant inju&s;|tice
we every day commit, and what ab|&s;urd
judgment we form, in viewing ob|jects
through the fal&s;ifying medium of
prejudice and pa&s;&s;ion. Had you a&s;ked
me a few days ago, the picture of Wil&s;on
the player, I &s;hould have drawn a por|trait
very unlike the real per&s;on and cha|racter
of George Denni&s;on&mdash;Without all
doubt, the greate&s;t advantage acquired in
travelling and peru&s;ing mankind in the
original, is that of di&s;pelling tho&s;e &s;hame|ful
clouds that darken the faculties of the
mind, preventing it from judging with
candour and preci&s;ion.</P>
<P>The real Wil&s;on is a great original,
and the be&s;t tempered, companionable
man I ever knew&mdash;I que&s;tion if ever he
was angry or low &s;pirited in his life. He
<PB N="229" REF="229">
makes no preten&s;ions to letters; but he
is an adept in every thing el&s;e that can
be either u&s;eful or entertaining. Among
other qualifications, he is a complete
&s;port&s;man, and counted the be&s;t &s;hot in
the county. He and Denni&s;on, and Li&s;|mahago
and I, attended by Clinker, went
a-&s;hooting ye&s;terday, and made great ha|vock
among the partridges&mdash;To-morrow
we &s;hall take the field again&s;t the wood|cocks
and &s;nipes. In the evening we
dance and &s;ing, or play at commerce, loo,
and quadrille.</P>
<P>Mr. Denni&s;on is an elegant poet, and
has written &s;ome detached pieces on the
&s;ubject of his pa&s;&s;ion for Liddy, which
mu&s;t be very flattering to the vanity of
a young woman&mdash;Perhaps he is one of
the greate&s;t theatrical geniu&s;es that ever
appeared. He &s;ometimes entertains us
with reciting favourite &s;peeches from our
be&s;t plays. We are re&s;olved to convert
the great hall into a theatre, and get up
the <HI>Beaux Stratagem</HI> without delay&mdash;I think
I &s;hall make no contemptible figure in
the character of <HI>Scrub;</HI> and Li&s;mahago
will be very great in <HI>Captain Gibbet</HI>&mdash;Wil|&s;on
undertakes to entertain the country
people with <HI>Harlequin $keleton,</HI> for which
he has got a jacket ready painted with his
own hand.</P>
<P><PB N="230" REF="230">
Our &s;ociety is really enchanting. Even
the &s;everity of Li&s;mahago relaxes, and
the vinegar of Mrs. Tabby is remarkably
dulcified, ever &s;ince it was agreed that
&s;he &s;hould $ake precedency of her niece
in being fir&s;t noo&s;ed: for, you mu&s;t know,
the day is fixed for Liddy's marriage;
and the banns for both couples have been
already once publi&s;hed in the pari&s;h
church. The Captain earne&s;tly begged
that one trouble might &s;erve for all, and
Tabitha a&s;&s;ented with a vile affectation
of reluctance. Her inamorato, who came
hither very &s;lenderly equipt, has &s;ent for
his baggage to London, which, in all
probability, will not arrive in time for the
wedding; but it is of no great con&s;e|quence,
as every thing is to be tran&s;acted
with the utmo&s;t privacy&mdash;Meanwhile,
directions are given for making out the
contracts of marriage, which are very fa|vourable
for both females; Liddy will be
&s;ecured in a good jointure; and her aunt will
remain mi&s;tre&s;s of her own fortune, ex|cept
one half of the intere&s;t, which her
hu&s;band &s;hall have a right to enjoy for
his natural life: I think this is as little in
con&s;cience as can be done for a man
who yokes with &s;uch a partner for
life.</P>
<P><PB N="231" REF="231">
The&s;e expectants &s;eem to be &s;o happy,
that if Mr. Denni&s;on had an agreeable
daughter, I believe I &s;hould be for making
the third couple in this country dance.
The humour &s;eems to be infectious; for
Clinker, alias Loyd, has a month's mind
to play the fool, in the &s;ame fa&s;hion, with
Mrs. Winifred Jenkins. He has even
&s;ounded me on the &s;ubject; but I have
given him no encouragement to pro&s;ecute
this &s;cheme&mdash;I told him I thought he
might do better, as there was no engage|ment
nor promi&s;e &s;ub&s;i&s;ting; that I did
not know what de&s;igns my uncle might
have formed for his advantage; but I
was of opinion, that he &s;hould not, at
pre&s;ent, run the ri&s;que of di&s;obliging him
by any premature application of this
nature&mdash;Hone&s;t Humphry prote&s;ted
he would &s;uffer death &s;ooner than do
or &s;ay any thing that &s;hould give
offence to the '&s;quire: but he owned he
had a kindne&s;s for the young woman, and
had rea&s;on to think &s;he looked upon him
with a favourable eye; that he con&s;ider|ed
this mutual manife&s;tation of good will,
as an engagement under&s;tood, which
ought to be binding to the con&s;cience of
an hone&s;t man; and he hoped the '&s;quire
<PB N="232" REF="232">
and I would be of the &s;ame opinion,
when we &s;hould be at lei&s;ure to be&s;tow
any thought about the matter&mdash;I believe
he is in the right; and we &s;hall find time
to take his ca&s;e into con&s;ideration&mdash;You
&s;ee we are fixed for for &s;ome weeks at
lea&s;t, and as you have had a long re&s;pite,

MY DEAR, DEAR LETTY,</OPENER>
<P>NEVER did I &s;it down to write in
&s;uch agitation as I now feel&mdash;In the cour&s;e
of a few days, we have met with a num|ber
of incidents &s;o wonderful and intere&s;t|ing,
that all my ideas are thrown into con|fu&s;ion

either method or coherence in what
I am going to relate&mdash;my deare&s;t Willis.
Since my la&s;t, the a&s;pect of affairs is
totally changed!&mdash;and &s;o changed!&mdash;but,
I would fain give you a regular detail&mdash;
In pa&s;&s;ing a river, about eight days ago,
our coach was overturned, and &s;ome of
us narrowly e&s;caped with life&mdash;My uncle
had well nigh peri&s;hed&mdash;O Heaven, I
cannot reflect upon that circum&s;tance
without horror&mdash;I &s;hould have lo&s;t my be&s;t
friend, my father and protector, but for
the re&s;olution and activity of his &s;ervant
Humphry Clinker, whom Providence
<PB N="234" REF="234">
really &s;eems to have placed near him for
the nece&s;&s;ity of this occa&s;ion.&mdash;I would
not be thought &s;uper&s;titious; but &s;urely
he acted from a &s;tronger impul&s;e than
common fidelity&mdash;Was it not the voice
of nature that loudly called upon him to
&s;ave the life of his own father? for, O
Letty, it was di&s;covered that Humphry
Clinker was my uncle's natural &s;on.</P>
<P>Almo&s;t at the &s;ame in&s;tant, a gentle|man,
who came to offer us his a&s;&s;i&s;tance,
and invite us to his hou&s;e, turned out to
be a very old friend of Mr. Bramble&mdash;
His name is Mr. Denni&s;on, one of the
worthie&s;t men living; and his lady is a
perfect &s;aint upon earth. They have an
only &s;on&mdash;who do you think is this only
&s;on?&mdash;O Letty!&mdash;O gracious heaven!
how my heart palpitates, when I tell you
that this only &s;on of Mr. Denni&s;on, is that
very identical youth who, under the name
of Wil&s;on, has made &s;uch ravage in my
heart!&mdash;Yes, my dear friend! Wil&s;on and
I are now lodged in the &s;ame hou&s;e, and
conver&s;e together freely&mdash;His father ap|proves
of his &s;entiments in my favour;
his mother loves me with all the tender|ne&s;s
of a parent; my uncle, my aunt, and
my brother, no longer oppo&s;e my incli|nations
&mdash;On the contrary, they have a|greed
<PB N="235" REF="235">
to make us happy without delay;
and in three weeks or a month, if no
unfore&s;een accident intervenes, your friend
Lydia Melford, will have changed her
name and condition&mdash;I &s;ay, if <HI>no accident
intervenes,</HI> becau&s;e &s;uch a torrent of &s;uc|ce&s;s
makes me tremble!&mdash;I wi&s;h there
may not be &s;omething treacherous in this
&s;udden reconciliation of fortune&mdash;I have
no merit&mdash;I have no title to &s;uch felicity?
Far from enjoying the pro&s;pect that lies be|fore
me, my mind is harra&s;&s;ed with a con|tinued
tumult, made up of hopes and
wi&s;hes, doubts and apprehen&s;ions&mdash;I can
neither eat nor &s;leep, and my &s;pirits are
in perpetual flutter.&mdash;I more than ever
feel that vacancy in my heart, which your
pre&s;ence alone can fill.&mdash;The mind, in
every di&s;quiet, &s;eeks to repo&s;e it&s;elf on
the bo&s;om of a friend; and this is &s;uch a
trial as I really know not how to &s;upport
without your company and coun&s;el&mdash;I
mu&s;t therefore, dear Letty, put your
friend&s;hip to the te&s;t&mdash;I mu&s;t beg you
will come and do the la&s;t offices of maiden|hood
to your companion Lydia Mel|ford.</P>

<OPENER>To Dr. LEWIS.
DEAR DICK,</OPENER>
<P>YOU cannot imagine what plea&s;ure I
have in &s;eeing your hand-writing, after
&s;uch a long ce&s;&s;ation on your &s;ide of our
corre&s;pondence&mdash;Yet, Heaven knows, I
have often &s;een your hand-writing with
di&s;gu&s;t&mdash;I mean, when it appeared in ab|breviations
of apothecary's Latin&mdash;I like
your hint of making intere&s;t for the rever|&s;ion
of the collector's place, for Mr. Li&s;|mahago,
who is much plea&s;ed with the
&s;cheme, and pre&s;ents you with his com|pliments
and be&s;t thanks for thinking &s;o
kind of his concerns&mdash;The man &s;eems to
mend, upon further acquaintance. That
har&s;h re&s;erve, which formed a di&s;agree|able
hu&s;k about his character, begins to
peel off in the cour&s;e of our communica|tion
&mdash;I have great hopes that he and
Tabby will be as happily paired as any
two draught animals in the kingdom;
<PB N="245" REF="245">
and I make no doubt but that he will
prove a valuable acqui&s;ition to our little
&s;ociety, in the article of conver&s;ation, by
the fire-&s;ide in winter.</P>
<P>Your objection to my pa&s;&s;ing this &s;ea&s;on
of the year at &s;uch a di&s;tance from home,
would have more weight if I did not
find my&s;elf perfectly at my ea&s;e where I
am; and my health &s;o much improved,
that I am di&s;po&s;ed to bid defiance to gout
and rheumati&s;m.&mdash;I begin to think I have
put my&s;elf on the &s;uperannuated li&s;t too
&s;oon, and ab&s;urdly &s;ought for health in
the retreats of lazine&s;s&mdash;I am per&s;uaded
that all valetudinarians are too &s;edentary,
too regular, and too cautious&mdash;We
&s;hould &s;ometimes increa&s;e the motion of
the machine, to <HI>unclog the wheels of life;</HI>
and now and then take a plunge amid&s;t
the waves of exce&s;s, in order to ca&s;e-har|den
the con&s;titution. I have even found
a change of company as nece&s;&s;ary as a
change of air, to promote a vigorous cir|culation
of the &s;pirits, which is the very
e&s;&s;ence and criterion of good health.</P>
<P>Since my la&s;t, I have been performing
the duties of friend&s;hip, that required a
great deal of exerci&s;e, from which I hope
to derive &s;ome benefit&mdash;Under&s;tanding,
by the greate&s;t accident in the world, that
<PB N="246" REF="246">
Mr. Baynard's wife was dangerou&s;ly ill of
a pleuritic fever, I borrowed Denni&s;on's
po&s;t-chai&s;e, and went a-cro&s;s the country
to his habitation, attended only by Loyd
(quondam Clinker) on hor&s;eback.&mdash;As the
di&s;tance is not above thirty miles, I ar|rived
about four in the afternoon, and
meeting the phy&s;ician at the door, was
informed that his patient had ju&s;t expired.
&mdash;I was in&s;tantly &s;eized with a violent e|motion,
but it was not grief.&mdash;The fami|ly
being in confu&s;ion, I ran up &s;tairs into
the chamber, where, indeed, they were
all a&s;&s;embled&mdash;The aunt &s;tood wringing
her hands in a kind of &s;tupefaction of
&s;orrow, but my friend acted all the ex|travagancies
of affliction&mdash;He held the
body in his arms, and poured forth &s;uch
a lamentation, that one would have
thought he had lo&s;t the mo&s;t amiable con|&s;ort
and valuable companion upon earth.</P>
<P>Affection may certainly exi&s;t indepen|dent
of e&s;teem; nay, the &s;ame object may
be lovely in one re&s;pect, and dete&s;table
in another&mdash;The mind has a &s;urpri&s;ing
faculty of accommodating, and even at|taching
it&s;elf, in &s;uch a manner, by dint of
u&s;e, to things that are in their own nature
di&s;agreeable, and even pernicious, that it
cannot bear to be delivered from them
<PB N="247" REF="247">
without reluctance and regret. Baynard
was &s;o ab&s;orbed in his delirium, that he did
not perceive me when I entered, and de|&s;ired
one of the women to conduct the aunt
into her own chamber.&mdash;At the &s;ame time
I begged the tutor to withdraw the boy,
who &s;tood gaping in a corner, very little
affected with the di&s;tre&s;s of the &s;cene.&mdash;
The&s;e &s;teps being taken, I w$ited till the
fir&s;t violence of my friend's tran&s;port was
abated, then di&s;engaged him gently from
the melancholy object, and led him by the
hand into another apartment; though he
&s;truggled &s;o hard, that I was obliged to
have recour&s;e to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of his valet
de chambre.&mdash;In a few minutes, how|ever,
he recollected him&s;elf, and folding
me in his arms, &startq;This (cried he) is a
friendly office, indeed!&mdash;I know not
how you came hither; but, I think,
Heaven &s;ent you to prevent my going
di&s;tracted.&mdash;O Matthew! I have lo&s;t
my dear Harriet!&mdash;my poor, gentle,
tender creature, that loved me with &s;uch
warmth and purity of affection&mdash;my
con&s;tant companion of twenty years!
&mdash;She's gone&mdash;&s;he's gone for ever!&mdash;
Heaven and earth! where is &s;he?&mdash;
Death &s;hall not part us!&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="248" REF="248">
So &s;aying, he &s;tarted up, and could
hardly be with-held from returning to the
&s;cene we had quitted&mdash;You will perceive
it would have been very ab&s;urd for me
to argue with a man that talked &s;o madly.
&mdash;On all &s;uch occa&s;ions, the fir&s;t torrent
of pa&s;&s;ion mu&s;t be allowed to &s;ub&s;ide
gradually.&mdash;I endeavoured to beguile his
attention by &s;tarting little hints and in&s;i|nuating
other objects of di&s;cour&s;e imper|ceptibly;
and being exceedingly plea&s;ed
in my own mind at this event, I exerted
my&s;elf with &s;uch an extraordinary flow of
&s;pirits as was attended with &s;ucce&s;s.&mdash;
In a few hours, he was calm enough to
hear rea&s;on, and even to own that Hea|ven
could not have interpo&s;ed more effec|tually
to re&s;cue him from di&s;grace and
ruin.&mdash;That he might not, however, re|lap&s;e
into weakne&s;&s;es for want of com|pany,
I pa&s;&s;ed the night in his chamber,
in a little tent bed brought thither on pur|po&s;e;
and well it was I took this precau|tion,
for he &s;tarted up in bed &s;everal
times, and would have played the fool,
if I had not been pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>Next day he was in a condition to
talk of bu&s;ine&s;s, and ve&s;ted me with
full authority over his hou&s;hold, which I
<PB N="249" REF="249">
began to exerci&s;e without lo&s;s of time,
tho' not before he knew and approved of
the &s;cheme I had projected for his advan|tage.
&mdash;He would have quitted the hou&s;e
immediately; but this retreat I oppo&s;ed.
&mdash;Far from encouraging a temporary
di&s;gu&s;t, which might degenerate into an
habitual aver&s;ion, I re&s;olved, if po&s;&s;ible,
to attach him more than ever to his Hou&s;|hold
Gods.&mdash;I gave directions for the fu|neral
to be as private as was con&s;i&s;tent
with decency; I wrote to London, that
an inventory and e&s;timate might be made
of the furniture and effects in his town-hou&s;e,
and gave notice to the landlord,
that Mr. Baynard &s;hould quit the premi|&s;es
at Lady-day; I &s;et a per&s;on at work
to take account of every thing in the
country-hou&s;e, including hor&s;es, carriages,
and harne&s;s; I &s;ettled the young gentle|man
at a boarding-&s;chool, kept by a cler|gyman
in the neighbourhood, and thither
he went without reluctance, as &s;oon as he
knew that he was to be troubled no more
with his tutor, whom we di&s;mi&s;&s;ed.&mdash;The
aunt continued very &s;ullen, and never ap|peared
at table, though Mr. Baynard payed
his re&s;pects to her every day in her own
chamber; there al&s;o &s;he held conferences
with the waiting-women and other &s;er|vants
<PB N="250" REF="250">
of the family: but, the moment her
niece was interred, &s;he went away in a po&s;t-chai&s;e
prepared for that purpo&s;e: &s;he did
not leave the hou&s;e, however, without
giving Mr. Baynard to under&s;tand, that
the wardrobe of her niece was the perqui|&s;ite
of her woman; accordingly that
worthle&s;s dr$b received all the clothes,
laces, and linen of her decea&s;ed mi&s;tre&s;s,
to the value of five hundred pounds, at a
moderate computation.</P>
<P>The next &s;tep I took was to di&s;band
that legion of &s;upernumerary dome&s;tics,
who had preyed &s;o long upon the vitals
of my friend: a parcel of idle drones,
&s;o intolerably in&s;olent, that they even
treated their own ma&s;ter with the mo&s;t
contemptuous neglect. They had been
generally hired by his wife, according to
the recommendation of her woman, and
the&s;e were the only patrons to whom they
payed the lea&s;t deference. I had there|fore
uncommon &s;atisfaction in clearing the
hou&s;e of tho&s;e vermin. The woman of
the decea&s;ed, and a chambermaid, a valet
de chambre, a butler, a French cook, a
ma&s;ter gardner, two footmen, and a coach|man,
I payed off, and turned out of the
hou&s;e immediately, paying to each a
month's wages in lieu of warning. Tho&s;e
<PB N="251" REF="251">
whom I retained, con&s;i&s;ted of a female
cook, who had been a&s;&s;i&s;tant to the French|man,
a hou&s;e maid, an old lacquey, a
po&s;tilion, and under-gardener. Thus I
removed at once a huge mountain of ex|pence
and care from the &s;houlders of my
friend, who could hardly believe the evi|dence
of his own &s;en&s;es, when he found
him&s;elf &s;o &s;uddenly and &s;o effectually re|lieved.
His heart, however, was &s;till
&s;ubject to vibrations of tenderne&s;s,
which returned at certain intervals, ex|torting
&s;ighs, and tears, and exclamations
of grief and impatience: but the&s;e fits
grew every day le&s;s violent and le&s;s fre|quent,
'till at length his rea&s;on obtained
a complete victory over the infirmities of
his nature.</P>
<P>Upon an accurate inquiry into the &s;tate
of his affairs, I find his debts amount to
twenty thou&s;and pounds, for eighteen
thou&s;and pounds of which &s;um his e&s;tate
is mortgaged; and as he pays five per
cent. intere&s;t, and &s;ome of his farms are
unoccupied, he does not receive above
two hundred pounds a year clear from his
lands, over and above the intere&s;t of his
wife's fortune, which produced eight hun|dred
pounds annually. For lightening
this heavy burthen, I devi&s;ed the follow|ing
<PB N="252" REF="252">
expedient.&mdash;His wife's jewels, toge|ther
with his &s;uperfluous plate and furni|ture
in both hou&s;es, his hor&s;es and carri|ages,
which are already adverti&s;ed to be
&s;old by auction, will, according to the e&s;|timate,
produce two thou&s;and five hun|dred
pounds in ready money, with which
the debt will be immediately reduced to
eighteen thou&s;and pounds&mdash;I have under|taken
to find him ten thou&s;and pounds at
four per cent. by which means he will
&s;ave one hundred a-year in the article of
intere&s;t, and perhaps we &s;hall be able to
borrow the other eight thou&s;and on the
&s;ame terms. According to his own &s;cheme
of a country life, he &s;ays he can live com|fortably
for three hundred pounds a year;
but, as he has a &s;on to educate, we will
allow him five hundred; then there will
be an accumulating fund of &s;even hun|dred
a-year, principal and intere&s;t, to pay
off the incumbrance; and, I think, we
may mode&s;tly add three hundred, on the
pre&s;umption of new-lea&s;ing and improv|ing
the vacant farms: &s;o that, in a couple
of years, I &s;uppo&s;e there will be above a
thou&s;and a-year appropriated to liquidate
a debt of &s;ixteen thou&s;and.</P>
<P>We forthwith began to cla&s;s and &s;et
apart the articles de&s;igned for &s;ale, under
<PB N="253" REF="253">
the direction of an upholder from Lon|don;
and, that nobody in the hou&s;e might
be idle, commenced our reformation with|out
doors, as well as within. With Bay|nard's
good leave, I ordered the gardener
to turn the rivulet into its old channel,
to refre&s;h the fainting Naiads, who had &s;o
long langui&s;hed among mouldring roots,
withered leaves, and dry pebbles.&mdash;The
&s;hrubbery is condemned to extirpation;
and the plea&s;ure-ground will be re&s;tored
to its original u&s;e of corn-field and pa&s;|ture.
&mdash;Orders are given for rebuilding the
walls of the garden at the back of the
hou&s;e, and for planting clumps of firs, in|termingled
with beech and che&s;nut, at the
ea&s;t end, which is now quite expo&s;ed to
the &s;urly bla&s;ts that come from that quar|ter.
All the&s;e works being actually be|gun,
and the hou&s;e and auction left to
the care and management of a reputable
attorney, I brought Baynard along with
me in the chai&s;e, and made him acquaint|ed
with Denni&s;on, who&s;e goodne&s;s of heart
would not fail to engage his e&s;teem and
affection.&mdash;He is indeed charmed with
our &s;ociety in general, and declares that
he never &s;aw the theory of true plea&s;ure
reduced to practice before.&mdash;I really be|lieve
it would not be an ea&s;y ta&s;k to find
<PB N="254" REF="254">
&s;uch a number of individuals a&s;&s;embled
under one roof, more happy than we are
at pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t tell you, however, in confidence,
I &s;u&s;pect Tabby of tergiver&s;ation.&mdash;I have
been &s;o long accu&s;tomed to that original,
that I know all the caprices of her heart,
and can often perceive her de&s;igns while
they are yet in embrio&mdash;She attached her|&s;elf
to Li&s;mahago for no other rea&s;on
but that &s;he de&s;paired of making a more
agreeable conque&s;t.&mdash;At pre&s;ent, if I am
not much mi&s;taken in my ob&s;ervation, &s;he
would gladly convert the widowhood of
Baynard to her own advantage.&mdash;Since he
arrived, &s;he has behaved very coldly to
the captain, and &s;trove to fa&s;ten on the
other's heart, with the hooks of over|&s;trained
civility.&mdash;The&s;e mu&s;t be the in|&s;tinctive
efforts of her con&s;titution, rather
than the effects of any deliberate de&s;ign;
for matters are carried to &s;uch a length
with the lieutenant, that &s;he could not re|tract
with any regard to con&s;cience or re|putation.
Be&s;ides, &s;he will meet with
nothing but indifference or aver&s;ion on the
&s;ide of Baynard, who has too much &s;en&s;e
to think of &s;uch a partner at any time,
and too much delicacy to admit a thought
of any &s;uch connexion at the pre&s;ent junc|ture
<PB N="255" REF="255">
&mdash;Meanwhile, I have prevailed upon
her to let him have four thou&s;and pounds
at four per cent. towards paying off his
mortgage. Young Denni&s;on has agreed
that Liddy's fortune &s;hall be appropriat|ed
to the &s;ame purpo&s;e, on the &s;ame terms.
&mdash;His father will &s;ell out three thou&s;and
pounds &s;tock for his accommodation.&mdash;
Farmer Bland has, at the de&s;ire of Wil|&s;on,
undertaken for two thou&s;and; and I
mu&s;t make an effort to advance what fur|ther
will be required to take my friend
out of the hands of the Phili&s;tines. He
is &s;o plea&s;ed with the improvements made
on this e&s;tate, which is all cultivated like
a garden, that he has entered him&s;elf as a
pupil in farming to Mr. Denni&s;on, and re|&s;olved
to attach him&s;elf wholly to the prac|tice
of hu&s;bandry.</P>
<P>Every thing is now prepared for our
double wedding. The marriage-articles
$or both couples are drawn and executed;
and the ceremony only waits until the
parties &s;hall have been re&s;ident in the
pari&s;h the term pre&s;cribed by law. Young
Denni&s;on betrays &s;ome &s;ymptoms of im|patience;
but, Li&s;mahago bears this
nece&s;&s;ary delay with the temper of a phi|lo&s;opher.
&mdash;You mu&s;t know, the captain
does not &s;tand altogether on the founda|tion
<PB N="256" REF="256">
of per&s;onal merit. Be&s;ides his half-pay,
amounting to two and forty pounds
a year, this indefatigable oeconomi&s;t has
ama&s;&s;ed eight hundred pounds, which he
has &s;ecured in the funds. This &s;um ari&s;es
partly from his pay's running up while
he remained among the Indians; partly
from what he received as a con&s;ideration
for the difference between his full ap|pointment
and the half-pay, to which he
is now re&s;tricted; and partly from the
profits of a little traffic he drove in pel|try,
during his &s;achem&s;hip among the
Miamis.</P>
<P>Liddy's fears and perplexities have
been much a&s;&s;uaged by the company of
one Mi&s;s Willis, who had been her inti|mate
companion at the boarding-&s;chool.
Her parents had been earne&s;tly &s;ollicited
to allow her making this friendly vi&s;it on
&s;uch an extraordinary occa&s;ion; and two
days ago &s;he arrived with her mother,
who did not chu&s;e that &s;he &s;hould come
without a proper gouvernante. The young
lady is very &s;prightly, hand&s;ome, and a|greeable,
and the mother a mighty good
&s;ort of a woman; &s;o that their coming
adds con&s;iderably to our enjoyment. But
we &s;hall have a third couple yoked in the
matrimonial chain. Mr. Clinker Loyd
<PB N="257" REF="257">
has made humble remon&s;trance, through
the canal of my nephew, &s;etting forth the
&s;incere love and affection mutually &s;ub|&s;i&s;ting
between him and Mrs. Winifred
Jenkins, and praying my con&s;ent to their
coming together for life. I would have
wi&s;hed that Mr. Clinker had kept out of
this &s;crape; but as the nymph's happine&s;s
is at &s;take, and &s;he has had already &s;ome
fits in the way of de&s;pondence, I, in order
to prevent any tragical cata&s;trophe, have
given him leave to play the fool, in imi|tation
of his betters; and I &s;uppo&s;e we
&s;hall in time have a whole litter of his
progeny at Brambleton-hall. The fel|low
is &s;tout and lu&s;ty, very &s;ober and
con&s;cientious; and the wench &s;eems to
be as great an enthu&s;ia&s;t in love as in re|ligion.</P>
<P>I wi&s;h you would think of employing
him &s;ome other way, that the pari&s;h may
not be over&s;tocked&mdash;you know he has
been bred a farrier, con&s;equently belongs
to the faculty; and as he is very docile,
I make no doubt but, with your good in|&s;truction,
he may be, in a little time,
qualified to act as a Wel&s;h apothecary.
Tabby, who never did a favour with a
good grace, has con&s;ented, with great re|luctance,
to this match. Perhaps it hurts
<PB N="258" REF="258">
her pride, as &s;he now con&s;iders Clinker
in the light of a relation; but, I believe,
her objections are of a more &s;elfi&s;h na|ture.
She declares &s;he cannot think of
retaining the wife of Matthew Loyd in
the character of a &s;ervant; and &s;he fore|&s;ees,
that on &s;uch an occa&s;ion the woman
will expect &s;ome gratification for her pa&s;t
&s;ervices. As for Clinker, exclu&s;ive of
other con&s;iderations, he is &s;o tru&s;ty, brave,
affectionate, and alert, and I owe him &s;uch
per&s;onal obligations, that he merits more
than all the indulgence that can po&s;&s;ibly
be &s;hewn him, by</P>

<OPENER>To Sir WATKIN PHILLIPS, Bar^t. at
Oxon.
DEAR KNIGHT,</OPENER>
<P>THE fatal knots are now tied. The
comedy is near a clo&s;e; and the curtain
is ready to drop: but, the latter &s;cenes
of this act I &s;hall recapitulate in order.&mdash;
About a fortnight ago, my uncle made
an excur&s;ion acro&s;s the country, and
brought hither a particular friend, one
Mr. Baynard, who has ju&s;t lo&s;t his wife,
and was for &s;ome time di&s;con&s;olate, though
by all accounts he had much more cau&s;e
for joy than for &s;orrow at this event.&mdash;
His countenance, however, clears up a|pace;
and he appears to be a per&s;on of
rare accompli&s;hments.&mdash;But, we have re|ceived
another &s;till more agreeable rein|forcement
to our company, by the arrival
of Mi&s;s Willis from Gloce&s;ter. She was
Liddy's bo&s;om friend at boarding+&s;chool,
and being earne&s;tly &s;ollicited to a&s;&s;i&s;t at
the nuptials, her mother was &s;o obliging as
<PB N="260" REF="260">
to grant my &s;i&s;ter's reque&s;t, and even to
come with her in per&s;on. Liddy, accom|panied
by George Denni&s;on and me, gave
them the meeting half-way, and next day
conducted them hither in &s;afety. Mi&s;s
Willis is a charming girl, and, in point of
di&s;po&s;ition, an agreeable contra&s;t to my
&s;i&s;ter, who is rather too grave and &s;enti|mental
for my turn of mind.&mdash;The other
is gay, frank, a little giddy, and always
good-humoured. She has, moreover, a
genteel fortune, is well born, and remark|ably
hand&s;ome.&mdash;Ah Phillips! if the&s;e
qualities were permanent&mdash;if her humour
would never change, nor her bea$$ies de|cay,
what efforts would I not make&mdash;But
the&s;e are idle reflections&mdash;my de&s;tiny mu&s;t
one day be fulfilled.</P>
<P>At pre&s;ent we pa&s;s the time as agree|ably
as we can.&mdash;We have got up &s;everal
farces, which afforded un&s;peakable enter|tainment
by the effects they produced
among the country people, who are ad|mitted
to all our exhibitions.&mdash;Two nights
ago, Jack Wil&s;on acquired great applau&s;e
in Harlequin Skeleton, and Li&s;mahago
&s;urprized us all in the character of Pierot.
&mdash;His long lank &s;ides, and &s;trong marked
features, were all peculiarly adapted to his
part.&mdash;He appeared with a ludicrous
<PB N="261" REF="261">
&s;tare, from which he had di&s;charged all
meaning: he adopted the impre&s;&s;ions of
fear and amazement &s;o naturally, that
many of the audience were infected by
his looks; but when the &s;keleton held
him in chace his horror became mo&s;t di|vertingly
picture&s;que, and &s;eemed to en|dow
him with &s;uch praeternatural agility
as confounded all the &s;pectators. It was
a lively repre&s;entation of Death in pur&s;uit
of Con&s;umption, and had &s;uch an effect
upon the commonalty, that &s;ome of them
&s;hrieked aloud, and others ran out of the
hall in the utmo&s;t con&s;ternation.</P>
<P>This is not the only in&s;tance in which
the lieutenant has lately excited our won|der.
His temper, which had been &s;oured
and &s;hrivelled by di&s;appointment and
chagrin, is now &s;welled out, and &s;moothed
like a rai&s;in in plum-porridge. From
being re&s;erved and punctilious, he is
become ea&s;y and obliging. He cracks
jokes, laughs and banters, with the mo&s;t
facetious familiarity; and, in a word, en|ters
into all our &s;chemes of merriment
and pa&s;time&mdash;The other day his baggage
arrived in the waggon from London, con|tained
in two large trunks and a long
deal box not unlike a coffin. The trunks
were filled with his wardrobe, which he
<PB N="262" REF="262">
di&s;played for the entertainment of the
company, and he freely owned, that it
con&s;i&s;ted chiefly of the <HI>opima &s;polia</HI> taken
in battle. What he &s;elected for his wed|ding
&s;uit, was a tarni&s;hed white cloth
faced with blue velvet, embroidered with
&s;ilver; but, he valued him&s;elf mo&s;t upon
a tye-periwig, in which he had made his
fir&s;t appearance as a lawyer above thirty
years ago. This machine had been in
buckle ever &s;ince, and now all the &s;ervants
in the family were employed to frizz it
out for the occa&s;ion, which was ye&s;terday
celebrated at the pari&s;h church. George
Denni&s;on and his bride were di&s;tingui&s;hed
by nothing extraordinary in their apparel.
His eyes lightened with eagerne&s;s and
joy, and &s;he trembled with coyne&s;s and
confu&s;ion. My uncle gave her away, and
her friend Willis &s;upported her during
the ceremony.</P>
<P>But my aunt and her paramour took
the pas, and formed, indeed, &s;uch a pair
of originals, as, I believe, all England
could not parallel. She was dre&s;&s;ed in
the &s;tile of 1739; and the day being cold,
put on a manteel of green velvet laced
with gold: but this was taken off by the
bridegroom, who threw over her &s;houlders
a fur cloak of American &s;ables, valued at
<PB N="263" REF="263">
four&s;core guineas, a pre&s;ent equally agree|able
and unexpected. Thus accoutred,
&s;he was led up to the altar by Mr. Den|ni&s;on,
who did the office of her father:
Li&s;mahago advanced in the military &s;tep
with his French coat reaching no farther
than the middle of his thigh, his cam|paign
wig that &s;urpa&s;&s;es all de&s;cription,
and a langui&s;hing leer upon his counte|nance,
in which there &s;eemed to be &s;ome|thing
arch and ironical. The ring, which
he put upon her finger, he had concealed
till the moment it was u&s;ed. He now
produced it with an air of &s;elf-compla|cency.
It was a curious antique, &s;et
with ro&s;e diamonds: he told us after|wards,
it had been in his family two
hundred years, and was a pre&s;ent from his
grand-mother. The&s;e circum&s;tances a|greeably
flattered the pride of our aunt
Tabitha, which had already f$und un|common
gratification in the captain's ge|nero&s;ity;
for he had, in the morning,
pre&s;ented my uncle with a fine bear's &s;kin,
and a Spani&s;h fowling-piece, and me with
a ca&s;e of pi&s;tols curiou&s;ly mounted with
&s;ilver. At the &s;ame time he gave Mrs.
Jenkins an Indian pur&s;e, made of &s;ilk
gra&s;s, containing twenty crown pieces.
You mu&s;t know, this young lady, with
<PB N="264" REF="264">
the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Mr. Loyd, formed the
third couple who ye&s;terday &s;acrificed to
Hymen. I wrote to you in my la&s;t, that
he had recour&s;e to my m$diation, which I
employed &s;ucce&s;sfully with my uncle;
but Mrs. Tabitha held out 'till the love-&s;ick
Jenkins had two fits of the mother;
then &s;he relented, and tho&s;e two cooing
turtles were caged for life&mdash;Our aunt
made an effort of genero&s;ity in furni&s;hing
the bride with her &s;uperfluities of clothes
and linen, and her example was followed
by my &s;i&s;ter; nor did Mr. Bramble and
I neglect her on this occa&s;ion. It was, in|deed,
a day of peace-offering&mdash;Mr. Den|ni&s;on
in&s;i&s;ted upon Liddy's accepting two
bank notes of one hundred pounds each,
as pocket-money; and his lady gave her
a diamond necklace of double that value.
There was, be&s;ides, a mutual exchange of
tokens among the individuals of the two
families thus happily united.</P>
<P>As George Denni&s;on and his partner
were judged improper objects of mirth,
Jack Wil&s;on had re&s;olved to execute &s;ome
jokes on Li&s;mahago, and after &s;upper be|gan
to ply him with bumpers, when the la|dies
had retired; but the captain perceiving
his drift, begged for quarter, alledging
that the adventure, in which he had en|gaged,
<PB N="265" REF="265">
was a very &s;erious matter; and
that it would be more the part of a good
Chri&s;tian to pray that he might be &s;treng|thened,
than to impede his endeavours
to fini&s;h the adventure.&mdash;He was &s;pared
accordingly, and permitted to a&s;cend the
nuptial couch with all his &s;en&s;es about
him.&mdash;There he and his con&s;ort &s;at in
&s;tate, like Saturn and Cybele, while the
benediction-po&s;&s;et was drank; and a cake
being broken over the head of Mrs. Ta|bitha
Li&s;mahago, the fragments were di&s;|tributed
among the by&s;tanders, according
to the cu&s;tom of the antient Britons, on
the &s;uppo&s;ition that every per&s;on who are
of this hallowed cake, &s;hould that night
have a vi&s;ion of the man or woman whom
Heaven de&s;igned &s;hould be his or her
wedded mate.</P>
<P>The weight of Wil&s;on's waggery fell
upon hone&s;t Humphry and his &s;pou&s;e,
who were bedded in an upper room, with
the u&s;ual ceremony of throwing the &s;tock|ing.
&mdash;This being performed, and the
company withdrawn, a &s;ort of catter|wauling
en&s;ued, when Jack found means
to introduce a real cat &s;hod with walnut-&s;hells,
which galloping along the boards,
made &s;uch a dreadful noi&s;e as effectually
<PB N="266" REF="266">
di&s;compo&s;ed our lovers.&mdash;Winifred
&s;creamed aloud, and &s;hrunk under the
bed-cloaths.&mdash;Mr. Loyd, believing that
Satan was come to buffet him <HI>in propria
per&s;ona,</HI> laid a&s;ide all carnal thoughts, and
began to pray aloud with great fervency.
&mdash;At length, the poor animal, being more
afraid than either, leaped into the bed,
and meauled with the mo&s;t piteous excla|mation.
&mdash;Loyd, thus informed of the na|ture
of the annoyance, ro&s;e and &s;et the
door wide open, &s;o that this trouble&s;ome
vi&s;itant retreated with great expedition;
then &s;ecuring him&s;elf, by means of a dou|ble
bolt, from a &s;econd intru&s;ion, he was
left to enjoy his good fortune without fur|ther
di&s;turbance.</P>
<P>If one may judge from the looks of the
parties, they are all very well &s;atisfied with
what has pa&s;&s;ed.&mdash;George Denni&s;on and
his wife are too delicate to exhibit any
&s;trong-marked &s;igns of their mutual &s;atis|faction,
but their eyes are &s;ufficiently ex|pre&s;&s;ive.
&mdash;Mrs. Tabitha Li&s;mahago is ra|ther
ful&s;ome in &s;ignifying her approbation
of the captain's love; while his deport|ment
is the very pink of gallantry.&mdash;He
&s;ighs, and ogles, and langui&s;hes at this
amiable object; he ki&s;&s;es her hand, mut|ters
<PB N="267" REF="267">
ejaculations of rapture, and &s;ings ten|der
airs; and, no doubt, laughs internal|ly
at her folly in believing him &s;incere.&mdash;
In order to &s;hew$how little his vigour was
impaired by the fatigues of the preceding
day, he this morning danced a Highland
&s;arabrand over a naked back-&s;word, and
leaped &s;o high, that I believe he would
make no contemptible figure as a vaulter
at Sadler's Wells.&mdash;Mr. Matthew Loyd,
when a&s;ked how he reli&s;hes his bargain,
throws up his eyes, crying, &startq;For what
we have received, Lord make us thank|ful:
amen.&endq;&mdash;His helpmate giggles,
and holds her hand before her eyes, af|fecting
to be a&s;hamed of having been in
bed with a man.&mdash;Thus all the&s;e widgeons
enjoy the novelty of their &s;ituation; but,
perhaps their note will be changed, when
they are better acquainted with the nature
of the decoy.</P>
<P>As Mrs. Willis cannot be per&s;uaded to
&s;tay, and Liddy is engaged by promi&s;e to
accompany her daughter back to Glou|ce&s;ter,
I fancy there will be a general mi|gration

<OPENER>To DR. LEWIS.
DEAR DOCTOR,</OPENER>
<P>MY niece Liddy is now happily &s;ettled
for life; and captain Li&s;mahago has taken
Tabby off my hands; &s;o that I have no|thing
further to do, but to comfort my
friend Baynard, and provide for my &s;on
Loyd, who is al&s;o fairly joined to Mrs.
Winifred Jenkins.&mdash;You are an excellent
genius at hints.&mdash;Dr. Arbuthnot was but
a type of Dr. Lewis in that re&s;pect.&mdash;
What you ob&s;erve of the ve&s;try-clerk
<PB N="269" REF="269">
de&s;erves con&s;ideration.&mdash;I make no doubt
but Matthew Loyd is well enough quali|fied
for the office; but, at pre&s;ent, you
mu&s;t find room for him in the hou&s;e.&mdash;
His incorruptible hone&s;ty and indefati|gable
care will be &s;erviceable in &s;uperin|tending
the oeconomy of my farm; tho' I
don't mean that he &s;hall interfere with
Barns, of whom I have no cau&s;e to complain.
&mdash;I am ju&s;t returned with Baynard, from a
&s;econd trip to his hou&s;e, where every thing
is regulated to his &s;atisfaction.&mdash;He could
not, however, review the apartments
without tears and lamentation, &s;o that
he is not yet in a condition to be left
alone; therefore I will not part with him till
the &s;pring&punc; when he intends to plunge in|to
the avocations of hu&s;bandry, which
will at once employ and amu&s;e his atten|tion.
&mdash;Charles Denni&s;on has promi&s;ed to
&s;tay with him a fortnight, to &s;et him
fairly afloat in his improvements; and
Jack Wil&s;on will &s;ee him from time to
time; be&s;ides, he has a few friends in the
country, whom his new plan of life will
not exclude from his &s;ociety.&mdash;In le&s;s than
a year, I make no doubt, but he will find
him&s;elf per$ectly at ea&s;e both in his mind and
body, for the one had dangerou&s;ly affect|ed
<PB N="270" REF="270">
the other; and I &s;hall enjoy the exqui|&s;ite
plea&s;ure of &s;eeing my friend re&s;cued
from mi&s;ery and contempt.</P>
<P>Mrs. Willis being determined to return
with her daughter, in a few days, to Glou|ce&s;ter,
our plan has undergone &s;ome al|teration.
&mdash;Jery has per&s;uaded his brother-in-law
to carry his wife to Bath; and I
believe his parents will accompany him
thither.&mdash;For my part, I have no inten|tion
to take that route.&mdash;It mu&s;t be &s;ome|thing
very extraordinary that will induce
me to revi&s;it either Bath or London.&mdash;
My &s;i&s;ter and her hu&s;band, Baynard and
I, will take leave of them at Glouce&s;ter,
and make the be&s;t of our way to Bramble|ton-hall,
where I de&s;ire you will prepare
a good chine and turkey for our Chri&s;tmas
dinner.&mdash;You mu&s;t al&s;o employ your
medical &s;kill in defending me from the
attacks of the gout, that I may be in good
ca&s;e to receive the re&s;t of our company,
who promi&s;e to vi&s;it us in their return
from the Bath.&mdash;As I have laid in a
con&s;iderable &s;tock of health, it is to be
hoped you will not have much trouble
with me in the way of phy&s;ic, but I in|tend
to work you on the &s;ide of exerci&s;e.
&mdash;I have got an excellent fowling-piece
<PB N="271" REF="271">
from Mr. Li&s;mahago, who is a keen
&s;port&s;man, and we &s;hall take the heath in
all weathers.&mdash;That this &s;cheme of life may
be pro&s;ecuted the more effectually, I in|tend
to renounce all &s;edentary amu&s;ements,
particularly that of writing long letters;
a re&s;olution, which, had I taken it &s;ooner,
