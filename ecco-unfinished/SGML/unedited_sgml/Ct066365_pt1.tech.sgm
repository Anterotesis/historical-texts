<P>ON a mild evening in September la&s;t,
as the two nieces of Col. Dormer, a
gentleman of &s;mall fortune, in Rutland, were
leaning over the terrace wall of their uncle's
garden, admiring the radiant lu&s;tre of the
&s;etting &s;un, the mixed gold and azure which
played on a ru&s;tic temple belonging to a
<PB N="4" REF="5">
neighbouring villa, prai&s;ing the heart-felt
plea&s;ures of retirement, and the tranquil
joys of a rural life, the lovely Lady H&mdash;,
who&s;e charms had rai&s;ed her to the mo&s;t
di&s;tingui&s;hed rank, happened to pa&s;s by, in
a &s;uperb carriage, with a numerous train of
attendants, in her way to the North.</P>
<P>The &s;i&s;ters, for which we &s;hall hereafter
account, were differently affected: Loui&s;a
beheld this &s;plendid equipage with languid
admiration, and returned to contemplate the
objects which had before engaged her at|tention.</P>
<P>The eyes of Maria, on the contrary, fol|lowed
the coach till it was out of &s;ight: &s;he
continued &s;ome time after gazing at vacan|cy:
awaking at length from her reverie, &s;he
looked at her &s;i&s;ter in &s;ilence; &s;he &s;ighed;
her bo&s;om beat with an emotion unknown
before; &s;he forgot &startq;the radiant lu&s;tre of
the &s;etting &s;un, the mixed gold and azure
<PB N="5" REF="6">
which played on the ru&s;tic temple, the
heart-felt plea&s;ures of retirement, the
tranquil joys of a rural life;&endq; and felt,
for the fir&s;t time, the poi&s;on of ambition at
her heart.</P>
<P>She walked &s;lowly, with her &s;i&s;ter, to|wards
the hou&s;e; &s;he &s;topped&mdash;after a &s;hort
pau&s;e&mdash;&startq;Don't you think, Loui&s;a?&endq;&mdash;&s;he
he&s;itated&mdash;con&s;cious of the idea which filled
her whole &s;oul, &s;he fixed her eyes on the
ground; the ri&s;ing blu&s;h of mode&s;ty ex|panded
on her lovely cheek.</P>
<P>The &s;upper-bell now made them quicken
their pace; but, before they obey its &s;um|mons,
let me introduce to the acquaintance
of my reader the two heroines of my &s;tory,
with the re&s;pectable man under who&s;e roof
they had pa&s;&s;ed the la&s;t ten years of their
lives.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II.</HEAD>
<P>LOUISA and Maria Villiers were
the twin daughters of a country gen|tleman;
or, to u&s;e a phra&s;e more &s;uited to
his character, a <HI>&s;quire,</HI> a race happily almo&s;t
extinct, who was de&s;cended from a worthy
family in Nottingham&s;hire. To give his
hi&s;tory in few words, before he arrived at
the age of thirty-two he had wa&s;ted a de|cent
e&s;tate in the elegant plea&s;ures of
racing, cock-fighting, and drinking, with
beings as much below the &s;tandard of hu|manity
as him&s;elf; and &s;ent out of the
world, with a broken heart, an amiable wife
after two years marriage.</P>
<P>He died him&s;elf, happily for his daugh|ters,
whil&s;t they were &s;till of an age to pro|fit
by the excellent education given them by
their mother's brother, Col. Dormer; who,
in every literary pur&s;uit becoming their &s;ex,
<PB N="7" REF="8">
had been him&s;elf their preceptor; and who
had gone even beyond the bounds of his
little fortune to procure them, as far as his
remote &s;ituation and retired manner of living
made po&s;&s;ible, tho&s;e external accompli&s;h|ments
on which mo&s;t grave people are apt
to &s;et too little value; or, in the words of
a late noble writer, to give them &startq;The
Graces.&endq;</P>
<P>This gentleman, the worthy protector of
our heroines, was the younger &s;on of the
younger &s;on of a very noble family in a
di&s;tant part of the kingdom: he had en|tered
early into the army, where he had
$erved with honour; but a weak con&s;titu|tion,
&s;ome military di&s;appointments, a native
love of retirement, a quarrel with the head
of his family, and the death of a wife he
loved to adoration, had determined him to
quit the &s;ervice at thirty, though he had
every thing to hope from continuing in it:
he had bought a &s;mall hou&s;e, with an e&s;tate
<PB N="8" REF="9">
of about five hundred pounds a year, at
Belfont, a delightful village in Rutland;
where, as the human mind mu&s;t always have
a pur&s;uit, he acquired a pa&s;&s;ion for garden|ing;
a pa&s;&s;ion which filled up tho&s;e hours
which might have lain heavy on his hands,
and cha&s;ed the mon&s;ter <HI>Ennui,</HI> to avoid
who&s;e chilling embrace, men turn rakes,
heroes, game&s;ters, politicians, and hunt
Folly through her ever-varying circles.</P>
<P>But to return: the &s;hattered remains of
Mr. Villiers's e&s;tate, after paying a heavy
load of debt, produced about three thou|&s;and
pounds; which, with good birth, and
a more than common &s;hare of beauty, com|po&s;ed
the whole patrimony of our amiable
orphans.</P>

<P>I HAVE &s;aid, my heroines were hand|&s;ome:
they were much more; they had
the &s;oul, as well as the outward form, of
beauty: they had countenance, character,
expre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Loui&s;a was fair, her features regular, her
hair auburn, her eyes the cele&s;tial blue of
the poets: &s;he had a look of blended &s;oft|ne&s;s,
languor, and indolence, which &s;trongly
painted the native features of her mind.</P>
<P>Maria&mdash;But as &s;he is to &s;tand on the
foreground of the picture, &s;he de&s;erves a
more particular de&s;cription.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="4" TYPE="chapter">
<PB N="10" REF="11">
<HEAD>CHAP. IV.</HEAD>
<OPENER>MARIA then&mdash;</OPENER>
<P>Her face was oval, her complexion
brown, her eyes dark and full of fire, her
no&s;e Greek, her mouth &s;mall, her teeth re|gular
and of the mo&s;t pearly whitene&s;s, her
under lip a little pouting. Her che&s;nut
tre&s;&s;es would have waved (if the de&s;potic
tyrant Fa&s;hion had allowed them the liberty
of waving) in natural ringlets down her bo|&s;om.
She was tall, and elegantly formed;
her every motion exqui&s;itely graceful: but
it was a gracefulne&s;s I know not how to de|fine;
it was what courts may improve, but
cannot be&s;tow; it was native, I had almo&s;t
&s;aid <HI>wild;</HI> it was un&s;tudied, &s;pontaneous,
and varied, as the lovely play of the leaves
when gently agitated by the breath of Ze|phyr.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="12">
Natural in all, &s;he had, when conver&s;ing
with tho&s;e &s;he loved, a &s;mile of bewitching
&s;weetne&s;s; but, when injured, a look of in|effable
di&s;dain; a look which however be|came
her, becau&s;e it evidently aro&s;e from
the occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>Warm, &s;incere, &s;imple, unaffected, undi&s;|gui&s;ed,
every turn of temper and of &s;enti|ment
was painted in&s;tantaneou&s;ly on her
countenance.</P>
<P>She had one charm, which is of infinitely
more importance than is generally &s;up|po&s;ed;
I mean, that luxurious melody of
voice in &s;peaking, which pa&s;&s;es irre&s;i&s;tibly
to the heart.</P>
<P>Though beauty was the portion of each,
yet nothing could have le&s;s re&s;emblance
than the per&s;ons of the&s;e &s;i&s;ters; though
virtue formed the ba&s;is of each character,
<PB N="12" REF="13">
yet nothing could differ more than the fea|tures
of their minds. Loui&s;a was mild, in|active,
tender, romantic; Maria quick, im|patient,
&s;prightly, playful: nor were their
views and wi&s;hes le&s;s oppo&s;ite; Loui&s;a fan|cied
Happine&s;s repo&s;ed on ro&s;es in the &s;hade,
Maria &s;ighed to pur&s;ue the fugitive godde&s;s
through the brilliant mazes of the world.
Each had the bloom of health; but it
glowed more vivid on the cheek of Maria.</P>
<P>Col. Dormer, their uncle and guardian,
though he had pa&s;&s;ed his youth in the
mixed &s;ociety of mankind, &s;till retained that
beautiful &s;implicity of character which is
generally the companion of very exalted un|der&s;tanding:
he was well-bred, as much
from his early intercour&s;e with the great
world (an intercour&s;e which had been long
almo&s;t entirely &s;u&s;pended), as from the feel|ings
of a heart naturally de&s;irous to plea&s;e;
but that good-breeding never pa&s;&s;ed the
bounds of the mo&s;t exact and undeviating
<PB N="13" REF="14">
&s;incerity. Generous to the extent of his
income, frank, ho&s;pitable, chearful, his ta|ble
was the &s;eat of decent plenty and convi|vial
delight.</P>
<P>An enthu&s;ia&s;tic admirer of truth, nature,
and genuine beauty; his hou&s;e, his gar|dens,
his fields, every thing around him, re|flected
his own mind.</P>
<P>Simplicity, neatne&s;s, elegance, were the
characteri&s;tics of his little domain: delicate
in his choice, attentive in his culture, his
flowers bloomed more fair, his fruit had a
more delicious flavour, than tho&s;e of his
more opulent neighbours.</P>
<P>Indeed his mo&s;t &s;triking failing was that
of valuing him&s;elf rather too much on this
&s;ubordinate merit: he would, I am afraid,
have been better plea&s;ed with the reputa|tion
of being the mo&s;t &s;kilful gardener, than
the be&s;t officer, or even the worthie&s;t man,
in the kingdom.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="15">
He was tall, had fine eyes, a dark and ra|ther
pale complexion; with the air and de|portment
of a man who had &s;een that world
from which he had long withdrawn.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="5" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. V.</HEAD>
<P>MR. Dormer this evening perceived a
thoughtfulne&s;s and con&s;traint in
Maria's behaviour, which, being unu&s;ual,
exceedingly alarmed him: he told her &s;o;
&s;he pleaded, what &s;he really felt, the head|ach,
and retired early to her apartment.</P>
<P>She pa&s;&s;ed the night without re&s;t; the
ideas of coaches, coronets, titles, filled her
mind, and effectually murdered &s;leep. She
ro&s;e, determined to pa&s;s the winter in Lon|don,
the only place where, according to her
<PB N="15" REF="16">
new-born idea, beauty and merit were al|lowed
their &s;terling value; but greatly per|plexed
in what manner to propo&s;e to her
uncle a de&s;ign which &s;he was ab&s;olutely cer|tain
he would di&s;approve.</P>
<P>Col. Dormer, though he knew the human
heart, had yet never thought of taking his
nieces into more active &s;cenes of life: he
had fallen into the common mi&s;take of peo|ple
pa&s;t the meridian of their days, who,
feeling tranquillity their greate&s;t good, do
not &s;ufficiently reflect that it is in&s;ipid at
that &s;ea&s;on when expectation and the wi&s;h
for novelty are the &s;prings which actuate
the mind; when all opens fair on the dawn|ing
imagination, and a thou&s;and ideal plea|&s;ures
play in the chearful rays of hope.</P>
<P>Youth is of it&s;elf gay and vivacious;
Maria po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in a &s;uperior degree every
charm of that enchanting age; her conver|&s;ation
exceedingly amu&s;ed him, and it never
<PB N="16" REF="17">
occurred to him that his might not equally
amu&s;e her, or that &s;he could have a wi&s;h
beyond the little paradi&s;e of Belfont.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="6" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. VI.</HEAD>
<P>MARIA wi&s;hed to methodize her plan,
a plan &s;he was however re&s;olved at
all events to pur&s;ue, before &s;he propo&s;ed the
journey to her uncle. After waiting two
months, a conjuncture pre&s;ented it&s;elf, which
&s;eemed favourable to her wi&s;hes: by the will
of a relation &s;he was, though not of age, to
receive immediately a legacy of two hundred
pounds, which &s;he was to employ in what|ever
manner &s;he thought proper, without
accounting to her guardian.</P>
<P>A favourite &s;ervant of her late mother, a
woman of worthy character, had ju&s;t before
<PB N="17" REF="18">
taken a hou&s;e in Berners-&s;treet, and had
written to entreat her recommendation of
&s;ome &s;ingle lady to hire her be&s;t apartments,
which &s;he a&s;&s;ured her were fitted up with
the utmo&s;t elegance.</P>
<P>And, what made this hou&s;e particularly
agreeable to her, it was in the next &s;treet
to a lady with whom &s;he had made an ac|quaintance
the preceding &s;ummer; a lady
whom &s;he extremely loved, and under who&s;e
protection &s;he hoped to be introduced, with
every advantage, into the brilliant circle for
which her heart now &s;o ardently panted.</P>
<P>This lady, Mrs. Herbert, was a young
widow of fa&s;hion and unblemi&s;hed charac|ter;
rich, good-humoured, lively, di&s;&s;i|pated,
and a little capricious; &s;he had
&s;pent the &s;ummer with a family in Col.
Dormer's neighbourhood, and, finding no
being half &s;o plea&s;ing in the little <HI>coterie</HI>
with whom &s;he lived when in the country,
<PB N="18" REF="19">
had di&s;tingui&s;hed Maria by a very flattering
preference; a preference which her young
heart, then unemployed, ever on the <HI>qui
vive,</HI> and not ab&s;olutely &s;atisfied with the
calm though &s;teady affection of her &s;i&s;ter,
returned by the mo&s;t animated friend&s;hip.</P>
<P>Nor was Mrs. Herbert in&s;en&s;ible to Ma|ria's
regard; on the contrary, &s;he had her
perpetually with her, and found a thou&s;and
charms in her conver&s;ation: &s;he had indeed
taken &s;uch an amazing fancy to her, that
nothing but this amiable girl's being fifty
times hand&s;omer than her&s;elf, could have
prevented her giving her an invitation to
her hou&s;e in town.</P>
<P>Mrs. Herbert really loved Maria, as much
as &s;he could love any thing except admira|tion;
but that was her primary object, and
&s;he well knew, the &s;cience of light and &s;hade
was as nece&s;&s;ary a &s;tudy to a beauty as to a
painter.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="20">
She therefore cho&s;e for her con&s;tant
companion, particularly in public, a long,
lean, brown, young lady, of good family,
and not ungenteel, but with a face about
three &s;cruples hand&s;omer than that of Me|du&s;a;
doated on the Opera and Ranelagh
becau&s;e there were no two places where peo|ple
looked &s;o well; and abjured the Pan|theon,
not becau&s;e it was <HI>tri&s;te,</HI> but becau&s;e
it was unbecoming.</P>
<P>To this friend Maria would at fir&s;t have
communicated her de&s;ign, had &s;he not plea&s;ed
her&s;elf with the idea of &s;urprizing her by
an unexpected vi&s;it.</P>
<P>She was a little tempted to a&s;k Loui&s;a to
accompany her; but when &s;he reflected, that
by &s;o doing &s;he &s;hould leave her uncle in
ab&s;olute &s;olitude, &s;he waved the idea, and
determined to undertake the journey alone.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="21">
Had &s;he a&s;ked her concurrence, &s;he had
however probably been refu&s;ed. Loui&s;a's
blue eyes had not been turned on the ru&s;tic
temple merely to admire the radiant lu&s;tre
of the &s;etting &s;un, but to contemplate <HI>the
human face divine,</HI> in the per&s;on of a very
hand&s;ome youth, the only &s;on of the &s;quire
of the pari&s;h, but who, happily, had not an
atom of &s;quire-i&s;m in his compo&s;ition.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, Loui&s;a loved; Maria's hour was
not yet come; a di&s;tinction which will &s;uf|ficiently
account for the different manner in
which they had been affected by the brilli|ant
object which had bani&s;hed peace from
the bo&s;om of the latter.</P>
<P>After &s;ettling the plan with her&s;elf, Ma|ria
determined to pur&s;ue it the moment &s;he
could a&s;&s;ume &s;ufficient courage to di&s;clo&s;e
to Col. Dormer her wi&s;h to pa&s;s a few
months in London.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="22">
She knew he would remon&s;trate, but &s;he
had previou&s;ly re&s;olved it &s;hould be in vain:
&s;he was clear his di&s;approbation would be
only temporary; and painted to her&s;elf in
glowing colours his rapture and &s;urprize,
when he &s;hould &s;ee her return to Belfont,
after an ab&s;ence of two or three months, with
a ducal coronet on her coach; an event of
which &s;he had not the remote&s;t doubt.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="7" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. VII.</HEAD>
<P>TO recount all Maria's timid efforts to
unveil her purpo&s;e to her uncle, and
to ob&s;erve how often her heart failed her,
would be exceedingly unintere&s;ting to the
reader. Suffice it then to &s;ay, that, after
&s;everal weeks of irre&s;olution, during which
the agitation of her mind exceedingly af|fected
<PB N="22" REF="23">
her temper, and in &s;ome degree her
health, Maria propo&s;ed the journey with
he&s;itation, and her uncle re&s;i&s;ted with firm|ne&s;s;
till, at la&s;t, wearied out, not con|vinced,
and at once di&s;tre&s;&s;ed and &s;oftened
by &s;eeing the gloom continue, which he
hoped would have pa&s;&s;ed over like a light
cloud before the &s;ummer breeze, he, after a
thou&s;and cautions again&s;t the arts of a world
to which &s;he was a perfect &s;tranger, reluc|tantly
gave his con&s;ent.</P>
<P>He cautioned her, not again&s;t the giants
of modern novel, who carry off young ladies
by force in po&s;t-chai&s;es and &s;ix with the
blinds up, and confine free-born Engli&s;h
women in their country hou&s;es, under the
guardian&s;hip of mon&s;ters in the &s;hape of fat
hou&s;ekeepers, from which durance they are
happily relea&s;ed by the compa&s;&s;ion of Ro|bert
the butler; but again&s;t worthle&s;s ac|quaintance,
unmerited calumny, and ruinous
expence.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="24">
The fir&s;t dangers he knew were generally
imaginary, the latter, alas! too real.</P>
<P>After many long conver&s;ations, in which
this amiable old man drew a faithful pic|ture
of the various evils to which &s;he was
going unnece&s;&s;arily to expo&s;e her&s;elf; and
which &s;he heard with the attention gene|rally
given by pre&s;umptuous, believing,
un&s;u&s;pecting youth to the prudent le&s;&s;ons of
wary experience; her journey was fixed for
Tue&s;day the 10th of January; and an old
grey-headed footman, who had lived twenty

like ju&s;t drawing in the dark &s;hades
of his pencil, though the lines &s;eemed a
good deal exaggerated: &s;he reflected, &s;he

her mind, &s;he found her own &s;cale prepon|derate;
and ea&s;ily obviated all the dangers
he had &s;o elaborately di&s;played, by deter|mining
to make no new acquaintance to

down the fore-gla&s;s of the chai&s;e for that

painted to her lively imagination the gaudy

<P>MR. Dormer and Loui&s;a &s;tood &s;ome
time at the window without &s;peak|ing:
at length the latter put an end to the
&s;ilence, by venturing to a&s;k her uncle a
que&s;tion, which probably the reader may
have been inclined to a&s;k already; &startq;Why,
if he fore&s;aw &s;uch dangers in her &s;i&s;ter's
being in London unprotected, he had not
him&s;elf accompanied her?&endq;</P>
<P>He was &s;truck by the que&s;tion, as it had
more than once obtruded it&s;elf on his own
mind: he an&s;wered her as he had before
an&s;wered him&s;elf: he pleaded his decline of
life, his indolence of temper, his delicate
health, his di&s;gu&s;t of the world, his love of
tranquillity and retirement.</P>
<P>He did not perhaps him&s;elf really per|ceive
the governing &s;pring of his reluctance

<P><PB N="29" REF="30">
At another &s;ea&s;on he would not have he&s;i|tated
a moment; but to leave his garden
during the three mo&s;t important months of
the year&mdash;his early flowers, his hyacinths
then ready to blow, his tulips, his anemo|nies,
his auriculas; his lovely new polyan|thus,
the invaluable pre&s;ent of a curious
friend at the Hague&mdash;all the blooming hope
of the genial &s;pring, the floral pride of the

marks its progre&s;s by de&s;truction.</P>

changed her &s;tyle, &s;poke of Mrs. Her|bert's

<P>IN the cour&s;e of the evening's conver&s;a|tion,

di&s;appointment in re&s;pect to Mrs. Herbert,
had begged leave to introduce her&punc; to a
<PB N="36" REF="37">
mighty agreeable widow lady, to whom this
good woman had formerly been hou&s;e|keeper,
and who lived in the &s;ame &s;treet.
This lady was, to u&s;e Mrs. Merrick's own
phra&s;eology, one of <HI>the quality,</HI> and kept
the very be&s;t <HI>of</HI> company.</P>
<P>Maria's heart bounded with joy at the
propo&s;al; &s;he had no time to lo&s;e; her
money might be all &s;pent before Mrs. Her|bert
returned; the re&s;ource of which I &s;hall

were &s;everal ladies then in town who vi&s;ited
at Col. Dormer's, yet &s;he was not &s;uffici|ently

the kind of protection &s;he wanted.</P>
<P>Mrs. Merrick waited on the lady in the
morning; who, after a very minute enquiry
into Maria's &s;ituation, family, character,
and connexions, and on hearing &s;he was
a particular friend of Mrs. Herbert's,

that world for which her little heart panted:

&s;tarted into ideal exi&s;tence, and re&s;umed its
pri&s;tine glow.</P>
<P>As &s;he wi&s;hed to proportion the means to
the end, &s;he went to her bureau, and
counted her wealth: &s;he found it amounted
to an hundred and ninety-four pounds thir|teen

&s;hillings and &s;ix-pence, a &s;um which
&s;he &s;uppo&s;ed would la&s;t her a good part of

had another re&s;ource: a mine unopened;
and to all but her&s;elf, undi&s;covered; a mine
&s;he thought inexhau&s;tible.</P>

<P>Her portmanteau was her only <HI>confidante;</HI>

and a tragedy.</P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="40">
Though &s;he had expectations from the
two fir&s;t, yet it was on the la&s;t &s;he placed
her dependance.</P>
<P>Diffident as &s;he was by nature, that en|thu&s;ia&s;m
in&s;eparable from true genius, broke
through the veil which mode&s;ty would have
thrown over the merit of this piece; &s;he
felt &s;he had &s;ucceeded beyond her warme&s;t
hopes: the fable was intere&s;ting and pa|thetic,
the characters &s;trongly marked, and
the language at once mellifluous and &s;ub|lime.</P>
<P>Certain of her tragedy being received
with rapture by the managers, if her affairs
&s;hould oblige her to offer it, &s;he had no dif|ficulty,
but in determining to which hou&s;e
to give the preference.</P>
<P>The &s;hining talents of Mr. Garrick, of
which &s;he had heard and read &s;o much,

actor had left off playing him&s;elf in new
pieces; a circum&s;tance extremely mortify|ing
to her &s;elf-love, as &s;he had drawn the
hero of her piece with a view to his per|forming
the character.</P>
<P>At length &s;he determined to take every
po&s;&s;ible opportunity of &s;eeing tragedies at
both theatres, and to regulate her conduct
by the different degrees of merit in the per|formers.</P>
<P>As &s;he had however no pre&s;ent intention

from the heights of Parna&s;&s;us to con&s;ult

baronet, of one of the be&s;t families in

healthy country girl, whil&s;t dairy-maid
at his &s;eat in&mdash;&s;hire, took a fancy to
her, and kept her &s;everal years.</P>
<P><PB N="49" REF="49">
As &s;he was at once artful and imperious,
&s;he gained &s;uch an a&s;cendant over her anti|quated
lover, that at the end of fifteen
years, during which he had turned her out
of the hou&s;e, and taken her in again, at

had la&s;ted longer than u&s;ual, very gene|rou&s;ly

about a year from the date of this honoura|ble
alliance was kind enough to make his
exit, leaving her in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of two thou|&s;and
pounds a year, half of which was in
her own di&s;po&s;al.</P>
<P>As the people of di&s;tinction in the neigh|bourhood
&s;hewed no very &s;triking propen|&s;ity

&s;he very &s;en&s;ibly determined to tran&s;plant

loo, and now and then give a &s;upper, may
with very little difficulty, and without pro|ducing
a certificate of her virtuous life and
conver&s;ation (unle&s;s her deviations from the
rule of right have been very public indeed),
make her way into <HI>company,</HI> often into <HI>good
company,</HI> and &s;ometimes, but this is rather
uncommon, into <HI>the be&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>But, that we may not rate her lady&s;hip's
&s;agacity too high, it is proper to ob&s;erve,
that this plan was not originally her own,
but was fir&s;t &s;ugge&s;ted to her by a gentle|man,
with whom, whil&s;t he was on a vi&s;it
to the late Sir John, &s;he had contracted a

<P>This gentleman, who, from having been
a lieutenant in the Ea&s;t-India Company's

&s;o admirable an oeconomi&s;t, that he main|tained

<P>OUR digre&s;&s;ion being ended, we beg
leave to re&s;ume Lady Hardy.</P>
<P>This amiable protectre&s;s of the blooming
Maria was, at the time when our hi&s;tory
commences, about the age of forty-three,
from which &s;he had the mode&s;ty to &s;ub|tract
only eleven years.</P>
<P>She was, as to her per&s;on, what in the
country is called a hearty, hale, comely,
portly, woman; tall, large made, plump;
with coar&s;e features, a ruddy complexion,
<PB N="55" REF="55">
and an air and manner not very expre&s;&s;ive
of feminine &s;oftne&s;s.</P>
<P>Her tone of voice was &s;trong and ma&s;cu|line;
her addre&s;s forward and &s;elf-&s;ufficient;
&s;he had an ea&s;y confidence, which nothing
could di&s;concert, a good natural under&s;tand|ing,
with that in&s;tinctive cunning which in
the common concerns of life is of more im|portance
than all the under&s;tanding in the
world.</P>
<P>She was vain, ignorant, in&s;olent, a&s;|&s;uming,
vociferous, and &s;atirical; which
la&s;t quality &s;he found of infinite &s;ervice in
intimidating all who were once unfortu|nately
enrolled on her vi&s;iting li&s;t, from
daring to drop her acquaintance.</P>
<P>She was gallant, but without much deli|cacy
of choice; her fir&s;t favourite, from a
&s;imilarity of &s;entiment, was Captain Wil&s;on;
but though he was her <HI>home,</HI> yet her heart
<PB N="56" REF="56">
&s;ometimes deviated into a temporary <HI>vi&s;it,</HI>
when &s;he met with a hand&s;ome en&s;ign who&s;e
time hung heavy on his hands.</P>
<P>She was however &s;o di&s;intere&s;ted a lover
of virtue, that though &s;he has now and
then, as we have already &s;aid, ventured to
di&s;obey its dictates her&s;elf, &s;he would not
allow any of her acquaintance to tran&s;gre&s;s
its &s;malle&s;t law with impunity; nor was &s;he
ever known to give quarter to the minute&s;t
degree of female indi&s;cretion in another.</P>

<P>JOHN and the chair arrived; Maria &s;et
out; Lady Hardy received her at the
top of the &s;tairs, prai&s;ed her beauty, criti|cized
her dre&s;s, laughed at her <HI>mauvai&s;e
honte</HI> (for &s;he blu&s;hed, trembled, and &s;tam|mered
<PB N="57" REF="57">
like an idiot), and led her into the
a&s;&s;embly.</P>
<P>Maria entered the rooms, equally agitated
by plea&s;ure and apprehen&s;ion: on advancing,
a cold tremor &s;eized her, &s;he turned pale,
&s;he &s;topped; &s;he felt, and felt painfully, the
di&s;advantage of not having been earlier in|troduced
into the world; &s;he wanted that
happy &s;elf-confidence which is the indul|gent
companion of unblu&s;hing folly, but
which tho&s;e of &s;trong &s;en&s;e and quick feel|ings
can only acquire by being, almo&s;t from
infancy, in a crowd.</P>
<P>She looked round her with a timidity
which for a time &s;u&s;pended all her powers:
the lights, the numerous company, the glare
of dre&s;s, the impertinently enquiring eyes of
the women, who had been apprized they
were to &s;ee a new beauty; the more com|placent,
but not le&s;s curious, regards of a
few of the men (the greater part being too
<PB N="58" REF="58">
much engro&s;&s;ed by their cards to have af|forded
a glance even to Venus her&s;elf, if
&s;he had de&s;cended <HI>in propria per&s;ona</HI>) di&s;|concerted,
and almo&s;t turned her to a
&s;tatue.</P>
<P>She was awed, &s;he was intimidated by a
&s;et of beings in the aggregate, whom con&s;i|dered
individually &s;he would probably have
de&s;pi&s;ed; at lea&s;t if &s;he had known their true
characters.</P>
<P>A confu&s;ed murmur of admiration, as
Lady Hardy led her through the apart|ments,
added at once to her embarra&s;&s;ment
and her charms.</P>
<P>As beauty was a flower not very common
in this autumnal <HI>parterre,</HI> the lovely Maria
excited a&s;toni&s;hment; &s;he would have ex|cited
more animated &s;en&s;ations had any men

<P>A Quarter of an hour had elap&s;ed, our

mind; her apprehen&s;ions had given place to
unmixed plea&s;ure; her ideas were &s;till in
&s;ome degree tumultuous, but it was the tu|mult
of delight: when Lady Hardy offered
her a card for one of the gold quadrille
tables; &s;he was too happy not to be in|clined
to comply with any thing: but had

She &s;at down without having dared to en|quire

and had the good fortune to ri&s;e from the

&s;uppo&s;ed, did not dimini&s;h her happine&s;s.</P>
<P>She had ju&s;t cut out, and was pa&s;&s;ing
from one room to another, Lady Hardy
leaning with an air of intimacy on her arm,
when a &s;ervant announced Lord Melvile.</P>
<P>She turned ha&s;tily at the &s;ound of a title;
a &s;ound for which &s;he had li&s;tened impa|tiently
the whole evening in vain.</P>
<P><PB N="61" REF="61">
This young nobleman, the only &s;on of
the Earl of Claremont, who&s;e rank and cha|racter
intitled him to &s;hine in more di&s;tin|gui&s;hed
circles, happening to dine in the
neighbourhood, had accidentally, in his way
to Arthur's, rambled into Lady Hardy's,
who&s;e parties he generally honoured with
his pre&s;ence about once a year.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t object that &s;truck his &s;ight was
Maria, her countenance dre&s;t in &s;miles of
undi&s;&s;embled plea&s;ure, talking earne&s;tly to
Lady Hardy.</P>
<P>So much beauty, under &s;uch protection,
mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily attract the notice of every
man who was at all its votary.</P>
<P>Lord Melvile's eyes met tho&s;e of Maria;
&s;he blu&s;hed; he regarded her with an at|tention
the mo&s;t flattering po&s;&s;ible to her
charms; but in which, if &s;he had known
<PB N="62" REF="62">
the world, &s;he would probably have ob|&s;erved
a mixture of &s;omething like hope,
not quite &s;o flattering to her virtue.</P>
<P>If the well-known character of her <HI>chape|ron,</HI>
&startq;whom (to borrow the admirable de|finition
of Fielding) every body knew to
be what nobody cho&s;e to call her,&endq; might
naturally encourage ideas unfavourable to
Maria's honour, her own pre&s;ent appear|ance
was not very well adapted to de&s;troy
them.</P>
<P>The tran&s;port of &s;eeing her&s;elf in the
chearful haunts of men after a week of un|comfortable
&s;olitude, the admiration &s;he had
excited, perhaps her &s;ucce&s;s at play which
pointed out a new &s;ource of <HI>ways and means,</HI>
with the revival of that brilliant imagination
which had at fir&s;t &s;educed her from Belfont,
and the &s;ight of a man &s;he thought formed
to realize her fairy dreams of greatne&s;s; all
con&s;pired to give a glow to her complexion,
<PB N="63" REF="63">
a fire to her eyes, a gaiety, I had almo&s;t &s;aid
a <HI>levity,</HI> to her air, which it was not difficult
to mi&s;interpret.</P>
<P>Fre&s;h and blooming as Hebe, playful as
the Mother of the Loves, her form, her
manner, invited the &s;poiler, whom the pu|rity
of her heart would, if known, have
repelled.</P>
<P>If &s;he appeared charming to Lord Mel|vile,
he did not &s;eem le&s;s &s;o to her.</P>
<P>Among&s;t &s;uch men as compo&s;ed Lady
Hardy's a&s;&s;embly, he &s;eemed, what indeed
he was, a being of a &s;uperior order.</P>
<P>To a countenance full of expre&s;&s;ion, eyes
that anticipated all he meant to &s;ay, and a
form more perfect than that of the Belvedere
Apollo, Lord Melvile added that air of di|&s;tinction,
that ea&s;y dignity, compared to
which, beauty alone is a meer dead letter.</P>
<P><PB N="64" REF="64">
His addre&s;s was polite, &s;pirited, in&s;inu|ating;
his conver&s;ation that happy mixture
of good &s;en&s;e and frivolou&s;ne&s;s which makes
the mo&s;t plea&s;ing of all compounds, and is
&s;o particularly agreeable to women.</P>
<P>He had read, he had travelled; he knew
books and mankind; but the latter had un|fortunately
been &s;hewn to him through the
wrong end of the per&s;pective.</P>
<P>His father, Lord Claremont, be&s;ides being
naturally of a gloomy and &s;u&s;picious turn of
mind, had &s;een the world in the way mo&s;t
likely to give him unfavourable impre&s;&s;ions
of it; he had &s;tood high in admini&s;tration;
and, on a change of men, had figured not
le&s;s con&s;picuou&s;ly on the &s;ide of oppo&s;ition:
the &s;chool of modern politicks not being the
pure&s;t &s;chool of rectitude, he had found a
great part of tho&s;e with whom he co-ope|rated
knaves, and therefore naturally
<PB N="65" REF="65">
enough, though very fal&s;ely, concluded
knavery to be the characteri&s;tic of mankind.</P>
<P>For &s;uch a world he had endeavoured to
form his &s;on, and had, in this view, &s;pared
no expence or trouble to improve and adorn
his per&s;on, poli&s;h his behaviour, cultivate
his under&s;tanding, and corrupt his heart;
in all which points his labours had been
crowned with tolerable &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>He found it however impo&s;&s;ible to eradi|cate,
and very difficult even to &s;u&s;pend, a
warm &s;u&s;ceptibility of &s;oul, and an extreme
good-nature, both which &s;trongly oppo&s;ed
tho&s;e cold, uncomfortable, &s;elfi&s;h maxims, on
which he endeavoured to form Lord Mel|vile's
character.</P>
<P>He read him uncea&s;ing lectures on the
univer&s;al depravity of mankind, the &s;up|po&s;ed
total &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s of the human heart;
and, to confirm his precepts by the more
<PB N="66" REF="66">
forcible language of example, he introduced
him early into the intimate &s;ociety of a &s;et
of men, who&s;e general principles were as
profligate as their outward conduct was re|gular
and decent; and of women who prac|ti&s;ed
every vice with impunity, under the
ma&s;k of hypocri&s;y, and the &s;anction of <HI>bon
ton.</HI></P>
<P>To pur&s;ue my favourite allu&s;ion: in the
variegated garden of human life and man|ners,
he indu&s;triou&s;ly pointed out the weeds
to his &s;on's ob&s;ervation, and concealed from
him with not le&s;s &s;edulous anxiety the flowers
with which it at lea&s;t equally abounds.</P>
<P>Though he had in&s;tilled the&s;e de&s;tructive
principles into the young bo&s;om of Lord
Melvile, principles calculated not only to
loo&s;en the bonds that hold &s;ociety together,
but to rob it of all its &s;weets, he had in|&s;tructed
him to conceal them with the ut|mo&s;t
care.</P>
<P><PB N="67" REF="67">
He had taught him to &startq;&s;mile without
being plea&s;ed, to care&s;s without affection;&endq;
to profe&s;s friend&s;hip for the man he regarded
with aver&s;ion, and re&s;pect and e&s;teem for the
woman he beheld with contempt: to dre&s;s
vice in the graceful garb of virtue, and con|ceal
a heart filled with the deepe&s;t de&s;ign,
under the beauteous veil of hone&s;t un&s;u&s;|pecting
integrity.</P>
<P>He had &s;ucceeded in making him one of
the mo&s;t plea&s;ing men in the world; he had
not ab&s;olutely failed in making him one of
the mo&s;t artful. But, though his &s;y&s;tem of
conduct was formed on his father's plan, his
heart frequently revolted again&s;t it: his
principles were narrow and &s;elfi&s;h, his feel|ings
generous and humane.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, he had learned to <HI>&s;mile and &s;mile,</HI>

<P>Nothing is more ea&s;y. Whil&s;t he conti|nued
to &s;ee Maria, and for &s;ome hours
after, he thought her charming; but he was
too much inured to beauty, to receive from
<PB N="76" REF="76">
it very forcible or very la&s;ting impre&s;&s;ions,
though it never failed to excite his admira|tion
for the moment.</P>
<P>His attention to her was natural: &s;he was
the only very hand&s;ome woman in the room;
&s;he was young; &s;he was new; &s;he had,
though educated in the country, an air of
fa&s;hion, an elegance of manner as well as
of per&s;on, which the re&s;t of this re&s;pectable
company in &s;ome degree wanted; &s;he had
fine &s;en&s;e, and &s;prightline&s;s, mixed with a
very intere&s;ting &s;tyle of &s;entiment; &s;he had
with him, that lively de&s;ire to plea&s;e which
&s;eldom fails of attaining its end; and what
was of &s;till more importance, &s;he had di&s;tin|gui&s;hed
him, the moment &s;he &s;aw him, in
the manner mo&s;t flattering to his &s;elf-love.</P>
<P>His coquetry had therefore given the ad|ditional
quarter of an hour; he had ob|&s;erved
her refu&s;al to engage at quadrille;
and, on the information of her blu&s;h, and
<PB N="77" REF="77">
Lady Hardy's very intelligible &s;mile, had
ju&s;tly placed it to his own account; he
thought this complai&s;ance demanded &s;ome
little &s;acrifice on his part, and what le&s;s
could he make than an idle quarter of an
hour?</P>
<P>In &s;hort, he wi&s;hed to &s;ecure, though his
pre&s;ent engagements left him without the
lea&s;t intention to pur&s;ue, his conque&s;t.</P>
<P>He even quitted her with a kind of half
reluctance, and went &s;o far as to enquire
her name.</P>
<P>As his chair pa&s;t along the &s;treets, he
recollected her with plea&s;ure; it was indeed
that tranquil, languid, unimpa&s;&s;ioned &s;tyle
of plea&s;ure with which he had formerly con|templated
the &s;tatue of the Medicean Ve|nus;
but &s;till it was plea&s;ure.</P>
<P><PB N="78" REF="78">
He thought of her, it is true, without
emotion, but he <HI>thought of her;</HI> her image,
in all its native loveline&s;s,</P>

<P>His Lord&s;hip, having found this <HI>jewel of a

neighbouring kingdom, had kindly con|de&s;cended,
&s;uch is the empire of caprice, to
tran&s;plant her into <HI>his own fair garden.</HI></P>
<P>She pre&s;ided at his table, and did the ho|nours
of his hou&s;e; a &s;ituation, however, for
which neither her birth or education had
very di&s;tingui&s;hingly fitted her.</P>
<P>This amiable object of his Lord&s;hip's pre|&s;ent

at Paris, had fallen early into the hands
<PB N="80" REF="80">
of an officer in the Swi&s;s guards, had com|pleted
her &s;tudies in the Rue St. Honor&eacute;,
where, after a variety of adventures, &s;he
had attracted the notice of an old French
nobleman, who, after entering into a con|vention
with her as his declared mi&s;tre&s;s,
being di&s;gu&s;ted with a few little vivacities
$o which the warmth of her temper made
her &s;ometimes unhappily &s;ubject, obligingly
contrived to transfer her to <HI>mi Lor Anglois,</HI>
as the ea&s;ie&s;t way of getting rid of her, with|out
altercation, trouble, or expence: a cir|cum&s;tance
which we beg leave to &s;ubmit to
the con&s;ideration of every Engli&s;h gentleman
when he &s;ets out on his travels.</P>
<P>Lord Melvile found an elegant &s;upper,
ready to be &s;erved, <HI>et des convives,</HI> the
younger &s;i&s;ter of Dorignon, ju&s;t arrived,
and a little Marquis, who, on pretence of
joining his regiment, then in garri&s;on in the
Provinces, had left Paris, with all the
money he could procure, and eloped to
London with <HI>la petite Janeton.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="81" REF="81">
The countenance of Dorignon was dre&s;t
in &s;miles, which, being unu&s;ual, had the
greater power of attraction.</P>
<P>Lord Melvile, who, as he had made
&s;upper wait an hour, expected a &s;torm, was
enchanted with his reception. He entered
with ardour into the intere&s;ts of <HI>la petite
Janeton,</HI> and pre&s;t her earne&s;tly to fix her
re&s;idence in his hou&s;e; an invitation &s;he had
too much <HI>polite&s;&s;e</HI> to refu&s;e.</P>
<P>Dorignon was this evening uncommonly
brilliant: &s;he had carried her point in re|&s;pect
to her &s;i&s;ter, without even having had
the trouble to &s;ignify her commands.</P>
<P>She was in &s;ome pain about Mon&s;. le
Marquis, who might be an impediment to
her &s;i&s;ter's advancement, and who could be
of no further &s;ervice, as the voyage was
made, and his <HI>louis'</HI> reduced almo&s;t to the
<PB N="82" REF="82">
&s;ingular number: &s;he however con&s;idered
&s;he was in a country of liberty, where no|thing
in nature was more ea&s;y, if he &s;hould
grow trouble&s;ome, than to give him his au|dience
of di&s;mi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>She might even, by a little <HI>tour d'addre&s;&s;e,</HI>
make a merit of delivering him up to his
father.</P>
<P>Full of the&s;e agreeable ideas, and a thou|&s;and
more which pre&s;ented them&s;elves to her
fertile imagination, &s;he put in practice all
her convivial powers of plea&s;ing, the fruits
of her exten&s;ive knowledge of the heart of
man, and the various roads by which it is
acce&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>The divine creature! What engaging vi|vacity!

<P><PB N="83" REF="83">
Her &s;allies indeed were &s;ometimes a little
eccentric; but did not tho&s;e very &s;allies
&s;tamp a greater value on her paroxy&s;ms of
good humour? Could any thing be &s;o in&s;i|pid

<P>She was ruining him, it is true; <HI>mais

<P>And was it not the <HI>ton</HI> to be a little <HI>de|rang&eacute;?</HI>
Would not a wife, at any time, re|trieve
his affairs?</P>
<P>Such a proof too &s;he had given of her
di&s;intere&s;ted attachment! had &s;he not for
him (for &s;o he had been taught to believe)
abandoned Mon&s;. le Duc&mdash;in the very

<PB N="84" REF="84">
Duc, it mu&s;t be owned, was old and poor;
but &s;till it was a &s;acrifice, and he ought to
be grateful.</P>
<P>To be grateful? We know not what idea
this phra&s;e may pre&s;ent to our reader; but
to us it &s;eems to want no comment.</P>
<P>His Lord&s;hip was not however &s;en&s;ible his
pa&s;&s;ion for the fair &s;tranger was on the de|cline:
perhaps he did not chu&s;e to perceive
it, as he felt he had not &s;ufficient re&s;olution
to give her her <HI>cong&eacute;,</HI> though he knew his
&s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to her impertinent tyranny had
extremely lowered his character.</P>
<P>A little inclination, and more caprice,
had at fir&s;t forged tho&s;e chains which habit
and indolence had now riveted too &s;trongly
for common efforts to break: his good-na|ture
too contributed to render it difficult for
him to make tho&s;e efforts.</P>
<P><PB N="85" REF="85">
And wherefore &s;hould he undertake &s;o
painful a ta&s;k? If &s;he had, in &s;ome little
degree, cea&s;ed to intere&s;t, yet &s;he &s;till con|tinued
to amu&s;e, him; and to be amu&s;ed
was of infinitely more con&s;equence than
people in general imagined.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, his bondage could not be of long
continuance: his father, who wanted money
to pay off a mortgage, would nece&s;&s;arily
marry him, and then the affair would die a
natural death, without any unplea&s;ing ex|ertion
on his &s;ide, or any pretence for al|tercation
or reproaches on hers.</P>
<P>She could not expect him to di&s;obey his

<P>IT was one of tho&s;e clear fro&s;ty mornings

the &s;ea&s;on, the blue &s;erene almo&s;t rival|ing
the brighte&s;t tints of a &s;ummer &s;ky,
when Col. Dormer and Loui&s;a, impatient
to hear from their dear wanderer, drove, as
<PB N="92" REF="90">
&s;oon as they had breakfa&s;ted, to meet their
letters at Stamford.</P>
<P>Col. Dormer was &s;urprized at receiving
no an&s;wer from Mrs. Herbert; to whom he
had written the day after Maria left Bel|font,
to recommend her in the &s;tronge&s;t
terms to that friend&s;hip &s;he had &s;o warmly
profe&s;&s;ed for this amiable girl, which he
began to fear ab&s;ence had totally de&s;troyed.</P>
<P>He was not le&s;s &s;urprized that Maria had
not mentioned this friend of her heart in
either of the two letters which he had al|ready
received from her.</P>
<P>He con&s;idered the &s;cene of di&s;&s;ipation in
which Mrs. Herbert was immer&s;ed, and
therefore excu&s;ed that &s;ilence for which he
was prepared; but could not account for
&s;o blameable an inattention in Maria: he
had, this very day, written to chide her
gently for &s;o unpardonable a neglect, and
<PB N="93" REF="91">
to a&s;k a thou&s;and que&s;tions re&s;pecting her
fair friend.</P>
<P>As Maria abhorred every approach to
deceit, &s;he had her&s;elf reflected on this
omi&s;&s;ion, and thought her&s;elf obliged in
honour to communicate to her uncle a cir|cum&s;tance,
of which, for his own tranquil|lity,
&s;he could have wi&s;hed him to remain
ignorant: &s;he had done this in the letter
that now waited him at Stamford; &s;he
however &s;oftened the information by &s;aying
what was true, that Mrs. Herbert was every
day expected in England; and that, in the
mean time, &s;he was under the protection of
a lady who was &s;o happy as to be of her
acquaintance.</P>
<P>This letter, having been written the day
of her vi&s;it to Lady Hardy, and &s;ent away
before &s;he left her own hou&s;e, arrived at
the &s;ame time with that to Loui&s;a, giving
an account of the delightful evening &s;he

had pa&s;t in <HI>the be&s;t company,</HI> and of her
new-born pa&s;&s;ion for Lord Melvile.</P>
<P>Loui&s;a, who, though romantic, was le&s;s
&s;ubject to receive &s;udden impre&s;&s;ions, and a
thou&s;and times more di&s;creet than Maria,
&s;aw a great deal to di&s;approve in her &s;i&s;ter's
letter; &s;he therefore made u&s;e of that li|berty
to which every human being, of
every age and &s;ex, has an unque&s;tioned
right, and in which her uncle had always
indulged them, even when children, of ne|ver
communicating their letters, except from
choice: &s;he read it attentively, folded it up,
and, &s;aying her &s;i&s;ter was well, put it with
great &s;eeming compo&s;ure in her pocket.</P>

<P>LOUISA was, however, alarmed. She
knew the purity of Maria's heart, the
dignity of her &s;entiments; but &s;he al&s;o
knew her indi&s;cretion: &s;he knew &s;he was
much le&s;s beloved in the little circle of their
acquaintance than her&s;elf, and that any im|prudence
of hers would therefore be infi|nitely
more fatal.</P>
<P>There was a regularity in the mind of
Loui&s;a, which &s;et her amiable qualities in
the cleare&s;t and mo&s;t favourable light: the
virtues of Maria, on the contrary, though
perhaps &s;tronger, were wild and Pindaric,
and therefore too often mi&s;taken or over|looked.</P>
<P>Loui&s;a's attention was always at home;
&s;he was polite to every creature with whom
&s;he conver&s;ed, and polite almo&s;t equally to
<PB N="96" REF="94">
all: Maria's &s;oul was on wing to oblige the
few &s;he loved; but &s;he was &s;ubject to little
ab&s;ences in the common intercour&s;e of life;
ab&s;ences which wore the appearance of a
pride to which her heart was a &s;tranger,
and which very naturally made her a thou|&s;and
enemies whom &s;he had never thought
of offending.</P>
<P>From a &s;imilar inattention, Maria was in|di&s;creet:
&s;he overlooked, perhaps &s;he de|&s;pi&s;ed,
tho&s;e trifling forms, which ma&s;k vice,
and protect virtue.</P>
<P>Con&s;cious of her own integrity, and true
even to exce&s;s, &s;he di&s;dained every &s;pecies
of di&s;gui&s;e.</P>
<P>Had &s;he faults? they appeared in their
native colours to every eye.</P>
<P>Had &s;he virtues? &s;he left them to &s;hine
by their own unborrowed lu&s;tre.</P>
<P><PB N="97" REF="95">
Her mind, not $e&s;s pure and un&s;ullied,
was obvious and tran&s;parent as the clear ri|vulet
in the &s;eque&s;tered vale.</P>
<P>Maria &s;hould have avoided with care that

formed to be &s;afe and happy in the undi&s;tin|gui&s;hed

<P>MR. Montague was the gentleman of

as the magnet which drew Loui&s;a's eyes to
the ru&s;tic temple, and the latent cau&s;e of
her attachment to the &s;hades of Belfont.</P>
<P>He was the only &s;on of the lord of the
manor, to whom the whole village, except
Col. Dormer's e&s;tate, belonged.</P>
<P>He had been educated at Eton till &s;even|teen;
and at the time when we have cho&s;en
to begin our narrative, being exactly one-and-twenty,
was a fellow-commoner of Tri|nity
College, Cambridge, where he had the
reputation of being a young man of un|common
genius, and an excellent cla&s;&s;ical
&s;cholar.</P>
<P><PB N="101" REF="99">
His father, a man of &s;trong &s;en&s;e, a kind
of rural philo&s;opher, who held the pre&s;ent
<HI>macaroni</HI> race in the utmo&s;t horror, had
taken infinite pains to accompli&s;h him in all
tho&s;e manly exerci&s;es, of which force, agi|lity,
and health, are generally both the con|&s;equence
and the reward.</P>
<P>He was of opinion, in which we entirely
agree with him, though again&s;t great autho|rities,
that &s;trength of body had a natural
tendency to produce &s;trength of mind.</P>
<P>Active and light as air, Mr. Montague
danced, fenced, walked, rode, played
cricket, and &s;hot flying, better than any
man, of whatever rank, in the next &s;even
counties: nor was he quite untaught in the
le&s;s gentleman-like exerci&s;es of quarter-&s;taff,
boxing, and wre&s;tling; exerci&s;es which the
good old man in&s;i&s;ted, by multiplying the
means of defence, were calculated to in|crea&s;e
courage, a con&s;ideration of no little
importance.</P>
<P><PB N="102" REF="100">
As his father had the be&s;t pack of hounds
in the neighbourhood, and was him&s;elf a
keen &s;port&s;man, he had early in&s;pired him
with the ambition of being <HI>in at the death:</HI>
and though hunting was not his favourite
amu&s;ement, yet in the&s;e degenerate days,

to keep up that of <HI>men.</HI></P>
<P>But to Mr. Montague; his accompli&s;h|ments
were not all of the corporeal kind;
he was pa&s;&s;ionately attached to the enchant|ing

concealed her &s;entiments even from her

Mr. Montague &s;aw her with a delight of

<P>She awaked, &s;he regretted the fleeting

vegetated!</P>
<P><PB N="112" REF="110">
She aro&s;e at nine, and prepared to ar|range

<P>The fir&s;t two hours were devoted to her
<HI>fri&s;eur:</HI> &s;he had a morning vi&s;it to pay af|terwards
to Lady Hardy; and was to be in|troduced
in the evening by this indulgent
friend to a brilliant card party, for which
&s;he had received an invitation at her hou&s;e

<P>The lady by whom &s;he was invited had
been particularly di&s;tingui&s;hed by Lord

party, and he had made a bow of acknow|ledgement
and a&s;&s;ent.</P>
<P>She meditated during breakfa&s;t on the

counted her winnings at play; &s;he-read

regretted the time &s;he had &s;o unfortunately

<P>She &s;at down to her toilet: &s;he &s;tudied

<P>She was too much in earne&s;t not to &s;uc|ceed.
Lady Hardy called at &s;even; our

than the &s;tar of morning.</P>
<P>She entered the rooms; &s;he mixed in the
circle who were not at play; &s;he found al|mo&s;t
the &s;ame faces as the night before; &s;he
did not however find the &s;ame admiration;
as &s;he was no longer new, &s;he attracted very
little notice.</P>
<P><PB N="114" REF="112">
She looked round with a glance of en|quiry;
that glance of enquiry was vain;
alas! the <HI>mo&s;t charming of mankind</HI> was far
away. Her cheek glowed with a blu&s;h of
wounded &s;en&s;ibility and di&s;appointment.</P>
<P>She &s;at down to quadrille; &s;he knew not
a card &s;he played: her eyes were continu|ally
turned towards the door; her heart
fluttered at the &s;ound of every carriage
which &s;topped.</P>
<P>The &s;econd pool ended, &s;he was pre&s;&s;ed

<P><PB N="115" REF="113">
The hours pa&s;t on; &s;he grew impatient;
&s;he looked every moment at her watch: ten

<P>She found the women di&s;plea&s;ing, the

He &s;aid ten thou&s;and flattering things,

<P>&startq;<HI>A propos,</HI> Melvile, who is that im|men&s;e
fine girl to whom you was talking
ju&s;t now in the pit?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;The very woman, Charles, of whom
I was &s;peaking to you la&s;t night. Don't
you think her lovely?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Lovely? &s;he is enchanting&mdash;will you
introduce me?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;With plea&s;ure! I love to communicate
happine&s;s.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="129" REF="127">
&startq;But when?&mdash;how!&mdash;to-night&mdash;now
&mdash;this very in&s;tant&mdash;as they go out.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;A little patience, my good friend; to|morrow
night you &s;hall &s;ee her at Hardy's.
This good lady keeps Sunday; and your
acquaintance, as you are the <HI>ton,</HI> will be
an acqui&s;ition of which &s;he will be proud,
and for which I &s;hall receive her thanks.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I may depend on you?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Do you doubt my honour? She may
be worth <HI>your</HI> attention, as you are at
pre&s;ent unemployed.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;But pray? I want the <HI>carte du pais.</HI>
This divine girl? is &s;he kind?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I &s;hould think not: though her man|ner
is a little equivocal. She is at lea&s;t,
you &s;ee, <HI>en bon train.</HI>&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="130" REF="128">
&startq;She is in good hands certainly. But
to be plain; you have no de&s;igns there
your&s;elf? for I would by no means in|terfere.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;None, upon my word; though I think
her angelic, and her behaviour to me has
not been di&s;couraging: but I have too
much on my hands already.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Who, and what, is &s;he? I never &s;aw
her before. Is &s;he of fa&s;hion? &s;he has
that air.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;All I know of her, I learnt from Hardy's
<HI>maitre d'hotel,</HI> of whom I enquired. She
is ju&s;t come from the country, is alone in
a lodging, and her name is Villiers. This
is all the fellow him&s;elf ever heard about
her. You know Hardy is not very &s;cru|pulous
in her acquaintance, nor indeed
has &s;he a right to be &s;o.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="131" REF="129">
&startq;Alone in lodgings? That circum&s;tance
is promi&s;ing: &s;he is certainly nobody:
therefore one may hazard breaking
through forms.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;O fear nothing, Charles: the conque&s;t
will not be difficult.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;You know I am naturally timid with
women.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Your timidity here would be ab&s;urd,
She &s;eems to me a little adventurer, who
is looking out for men of a certain rank:
I know not with what de&s;ign, nor is it
material. You will be&s;t learn her views
from her&s;elf: perhaps they may differ
from yours, but you will probably bring
her to rea&s;on.&endq;</P>
<P>In the&s;e terms of re&s;pect, e&s;teem, and ten|der
veneration, did <HI>the mo&s;t amiable of man|kind</HI>
<PB N="132" REF="130">
&s;peak of a woman, who thought <HI>him</HI>
all but a divinity, and who amu&s;ed her&s;elf
with the idea of their hearts having been
formed for each other.</P>
<P>Yet let us be candid: Lord Melvile
might in &s;ome degree &s;tand excu&s;ed.</P>
<P>The impropriety of her unprotected &s;itua|tion,
and her apparent intimacy with a wo|man
of Lady Hardy's very equivocal cha|racter,
were &s;ufficient pleas to ju&s;tify &s;u&s;pi|cion.</P>
<P>Had he only &s;ilently doubted her conduct,
we would have forgiven him; but the very
unfeeling manner in which he endeavoured
to awaken tho&s;e doubts in the mind of an|other,
was equally mean, unju&s;t, and un|manly.</P>
<P>Nor was he le&s;s culpable in attempting
to en&s;nare her into an inclination which
<PB N="133" REF="131">
promi&s;ed to make her unhappy, and which
could afford no advantage to him&s;elf, &s;itu|ated
as he was, but the gratification of a
contemptible &s;elfi&s;h vanity, the lowe&s;t of
all human pa&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>After encountering &s;ome little difficulties
in getting to their coach, the ladies drove
to Mi&s;s Villiers's lodgings, where they
&s;upped together.</P>
<P>A new world had opened on the mind of
Maria. How different was this evening from
tho&s;e &s;pent at cards, with the &s;ociety in
which &s;he had lived the la&s;t fortnight!</P>
<P>She was enchanted with the entertain|ment,
and not le&s;s with the audience.</P>
<P>With all her partiality for Lord Melvile,
&s;he could not avoid ob&s;erving, that though
he really looked much hand&s;omer this even|ing
than when &s;he had fir&s;t &s;een him, yet
<PB N="134" REF="132">
that the &s;triking air of ea&s;y dignity, which
had &s;o particularly charmed her, was not,
as at Lady Hardy's, &s;olely appropriated to
his Lord&s;hip.</P>
<P>He had there appeared a being of a &s;u|perior
order; he was here only an elegant
man of fa&s;hion among&s;t his equals.</P>
<P>He retained the &s;ame air of di&s;tinction,
the &s;ame graces of deportment; but he
&s;hared the&s;e advantages with a thou&s;and
others; whereas at Lady Hardy's they were
peculiar to him&s;elf.</P>
<P>She $elt al&s;o, but &s;he felt it without envy,
of which not an atom entered into her com|po&s;ition,
that &s;he was not the only hand&s;ome
woman in London.</P>
<P>Lady Hardy to-night, by the whole tenor
of her conver&s;ation, endeavoured to fan into
a flame that &s;park of inclination which
<PB N="135" REF="133">
Maria, who was &s;incerity it&s;elf, had con|fe&s;&s;ed
for Lord Melvile: an attempt in
which &s;he &s;ucceeded but too well.</P>
<P>She did this with no more important
view than that of bringing a man of his
rank oftener to her hou&s;e; as &s;he was a
little a&s;hamed, and not without rea&s;on, of
the general &s;tyle of her male vi&s;itants.</P>
<P>As to the cruelty of &s;acrificing the peace,
and perhaps the honour, of a young, inno|cent,
un&s;u&s;pecting woman, who regarded
her as her guide and protectre&s;s, to &s;o very
trifling an intere&s;t of her own, it weighed
little with her: &s;he was a woman of the
world, and con&s;equently above the weak|ne&s;s
of feeling for any thing but her&s;elf.</P>
<P>Had &s;he been que&s;tioned on this point,
&s;he would have &s;aid coolly, &startq;'Tis her

After introducing his friend to the lady

tenderne&s;s; &s;aid little, but with that
irre&s;olute tone of voice, that &s;eeming timi|dity,
&s;o exactly re&s;embling love, and &s;o dan|gerous
to women who do not know the

<P>His coquetry redoubled at Sir Charles's
approach; he even thought her more lovely
on &s;eeing her &s;o much the admiration of
another.</P>
<P>He entreated permi&s;&s;ion to vi&s;it her, which
he obtained; he a&s;ked the &s;ame permi&s;&s;ion

<P>LORD Melvile, who felt him&s;elf unea&s;y

from the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of his inten|tion
to part with her, and of the plan laid to
make her engage in another connexion, and
who&s;e vanity was agreeably flattered by the
artle&s;s attention, and very obvious partiality,
of the young, the lovely, the unaffected,
the innocent, Maria, paid a vi&s;it to the

where he was to dine with Lord
Claremont, and &s;ettle the preparations for
<PB N="146" REF="144">
their journey into York&s;hire, which was to
take place the next morning.</P>
<P>He found her laone, he made a long vi&s;it,
he led her to talk more, and on a greater
variety of &s;ubjects, than &s;he had had an op|portunity
of doing at Lady Hardy's.</P>
<P>The plea&s;ure of &s;eeing him, and the lively
de&s;ire of fixing a heart on the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of
which &s;he felt her own happine&s;s depended,
called forth all her native vivacity, and gave
new graces to an under&s;tanding naturally
&s;trong, and improved and poli&s;hed by the
cares of her excellent uncle Col. Dormer.</P>
<P>He found the charms of her mind not le&s;s
attractive than tho&s;e of her form; and, if he
had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a heart, it would have been
undoubtedly in the greate&s;t po&s;&s;ible danger.</P>
<P>He was however &s;afe: the di&s;&s;ipated life
to which he had been long accu&s;tomed, the
<PB N="147" REF="145">
fal&s;e principles he had imbibed in the cour&s;e
of a$ very ill-directed education, and his
early connexions with the mo&s;t abandoned
of the other &s;ex, which naturally gave him
unfavourable ideas of the be&s;t, had de|&s;troyed
all the finer feelings of his &s;oul, and
rendered him almo&s;t a Stoic to every &s;pecies
of beauty.</P>
<P>Charming as Maria was, and plea&s;ing as
he found her conver&s;ation, &s;he amu&s;ed and
flattered, without intere&s;ting, him.</P>
<P>He felt infinitely more plea&s;ure in the
idea of triumphing over his friend Sir
Charles, than in that of being beloved by
a woman whom he thought of all women
mo&s;t lovely.</P>
<P>Dead to the genuine tran&s;ports of love
and delicate friend&s;hip, incapable of the
tender ties of affection, of tho&s;e endearing
relations which &s;trew the thorny paths of
<PB N="148" REF="146">
life with unfading ro&s;es, vanity was the
only &s;entiment of which he really felt the
empire; and Dorignon her&s;elf had only
held him by that imperious caprice, tho&s;e
well-di&s;&s;embled variations of temper and of
character, of which women of her wretched
profe&s;&s;ion know the effect, and which, by
keeping the mind in continual agitation, the
pa&s;&s;ions in perpetual play, prevent their
&s;ub&s;iding into that torpid calm which is the
mortal, the incurable, di&s;ea&s;e of inclina|tion.</P>
<P>He left the unexperienced Maria fully
per&s;uaded of his tenderne&s;s: he had looked
pa&s;&s;ionately, talked incoherently, and dur|ing
the whole vi&s;it had addre&s;&s;ed her in that
equivocal &s;tyle which &s;elf-love, e&s;pecially
when attended by ignorance of the world,
never fails to interpret to its own advantage.</P>
<P>He had vowed there was enchantment in
her form, in her conver&s;ation, in her &s;mile,
<PB N="149" REF="147">
which it was not in man to re&s;i&s;t; had left
the room three times with well-di&s;&s;embled
reluctance, and had returned as often to
bid her <HI>once more</HI> adieu.</P>
<P>She had not the remote&s;t doubt of his in|tention
to marry her: a mind like his mu&s;t
be incapable of any views, but &s;uch as were
dictated by the mo&s;t perfect honour.</P>
<P>She fondly imagined the journey he was
going to take with his father had been con|certed
by him&s;elf, in order to &s;ecure a fa|vourable
opportunity of confe&s;&s;ing a pa&s;&s;ion
which her birth and connexions (we mean
her <HI>family</HI> connexions) gave Lord Clare|mont
no pretence to di&s;approve.</P>
<P>She therefore depended on his Lord&s;hip's
acquie&s;cence; for as to fortune, &s;he thought
that a con&s;ideration infinitely below the at|tention

Lady Hardy came in, laughed at her gra|vity,
and, though with great difficulty, &s;e|duced
her to a card party: &s;he lo&s;t fifty
guineas at loo, found the company dete&s;ta|ble,
and came home determined to play no
more; her little exchequer was wa&s;ting
away, and &s;he was in danger of being di&s;|tre&s;t
before her great plan was accom|pli&s;hed;
a plan in which her heart was now
intere&s;ted, though vanity had been its pri|meval
&s;ource.</P>
<P>She could indeed have applied to the ma|nagers
of one of the theatres, in re&s;pect to

naturally attract general attention, and ap|pear
with double eclat.</P>
<P><PB N="157" REF="156">
If this event, of which &s;he, had little
doubt, &s;hould take place, it was her deter|mination

a public charity; a circum&s;tance which

reception; e&s;pecially with the acting mana|ger
of Drury-Lane, of who&s;e exten&s;ive be|nevolence;
and di&s;intere&s;ted protection of the

<P>All concern for her lo&s;s at cards being
ab&s;orbed in the&s;e agreeable reflections, &s;he

her&s;elf to the God of &s;lumbers, who, to

<P>MARIA'S latent pa&s;&s;ion for the theatre
being, by this train of thinking,
awakened, &s;he determined on going to &s;ee
the new tragedy of Braganza, which was
announced for the following day; and to

new tragedy.</P>
<P>John returned, with this an&s;wer, that
every part of the hou&s;e was taken, and not
<PB N="159" REF="158">
a &s;ingle place to be had for Braganza till
the thirtieth night.</P>
<P>Great as her di&s;appointment was, &s;he

<P>She anticipated her own &s;ucce&s;s in that of

<P>JUST at the moment of John's return,
Lady Hardy entered the room; &s;he
heard his me&s;&s;age, and Maria's reflection,
with a &s;mile.</P>
<P>&startq;My dear,&endq; &s;aid &s;he, &startq;you know no|thing
of the&s;e affairs; the hou&s;e being
engaged for thirty nights is a je&s;t, as
there are not &s;o many nights during the
&s;ea&s;on on which it is po&s;&s;ible this tragedy
can be played&punc; but there are a &s;et of
people, favourites of the hou&s;ekeeper,
many of them people whom nobody
knows, who are to be &s;erved fir&s;t; and
till they have determined on what nights
to go, no other per&s;on can be admitted:
you will perhaps imagine this preference
is given to rank and con&s;equence; not at
all: I have known a counte&s;s refu&s;ed a
<PB N="161" REF="160">
box, which has been given to the wife of
her linendraper.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;You look incredulous, my dear: I
will convince and oblige you at the &s;ame
time: I have a friend who is on the fa|vourite
li&s;t, &s;he &s;hall &s;end for a box for
to-morrow night, and we will be of her
party: give me pen, ink, and paper, this
moment.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;La Ro&s;e, &s;tep to Mrs. H&mdash;, and
bring an an&s;wer to this note.&endq;</P>
<P>La Ro&s;e returned with Mrs. H&mdash;'s
compliments, that her lady&s;hip might de|pend
on a box for Braganza the next night,
or any other &s;he cho&s;e.</P>
<P>&startq;You mu&s;t know, my dear,&endq; pur&s;ued
Lady Hardy, &startq;that this incomprehen&s;ible
conduct of the managers is one rea&s;on
why people of fa&s;hion have, in &s;ome de|gree,
<PB N="162" REF="161">
de&s;erted the play hou&s;es, and de|voted
&s;o many of their evenings to cards:
my good friend Pam has infinite obliga|tions
to the politicks of Drury-Lane.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;But, my dear Mi&s;s Villiers, I have
&s;omething much more important to &s;ay to
you: you are young and inexperienced,
and want the advice of a &s;incere friend
like me: you are playing a lo&s;ing game,
with every winning card in your hand.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;You expect to fix Lord Melvile (for I
am no &s;tranger to your mo&s;t &s;ecret views)
by waiting at home in &s;olitude for his vi|&s;its.
Nothing can be &s;o ab&s;urd, believe
me, as this conduct: if you wi&s;h to attract
the attention of a man of fa&s;hion, it mu&s;t
be by becoming a fa&s;hionable woman.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;You are in a road where you promi&s;e
to go far, if you do not unfortunately
mi&s;take your way.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="163" REF="162">
&startq;You have youth, beauty, politene&s;s,
under&s;tanding; and, wherever you ac|quired
it, an air of the world: you have
every per&s;onal requi&s;ite to make an <HI>eclat,</HI>
but you want that exterior &s;plendor which
alone can &s;et your perfections in full day.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;If you wi&s;h to carry your point, you
mu&s;t have a hou&s;e, &s;ervants, carriage,
and a thou&s;and other nece&s;&s;ary <HI>et ceteras,</HI>
without which you will ever be regarded
as one whom nobody knows, and be ad|mitted
into good company by a kind of
courte&s;y which is exceedingly humili|ating.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Your poor old John, with his &s;ank
grey locks, and antique civility, trotting
before a hackney chair, is a $ight more
ridiculous than you, who know little of
this town, can imagine.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="164" REF="163">
&startq;Let me &s;end you my coach-maker to|morrow;
I will find you a ready-furni&s;hed
hou&s;e, and a footman with the true in&s;o|lence

this plan, give cards and &s;uppers; be
at every fa&s;hionable place of amu&s;ement,
dre&s;t with the mo&s;t &s;tudied elegance,

beauty, and in le&s;s than &s;ix weeks I &s;hall
&s;ee Lady Melvile's carriage at my door.&endq;</P>
<P>Ideas &s;o con&s;onant to Maria's wi&s;hes,
could not fail of being attended to with de|light:
&s;he forgot the &s;tate of her almo&s;t ex|hau&s;ted
finances, and con&s;ented to all Lady
Hardy propo&s;ed: after a moment's reflec|tion,
&s;he objected to taking a hou&s;e, as &s;he
was determined on no account to leave Mrs.
Merrick; &s;he agreed, without he&s;itation,
to take a more fa&s;hionable footman, but
without parting from her faithful John, and
to hire a chariot by the month.</P>
<P><PB N="165" REF="164">
She was particularly anxious to make
this new arrangement before Lord Melvile
returned from the country: Lady Hardy
undertook the whole; and it was agreed be|tween
them, that her carriage and new foot|man
&s;hould attend her the Saturday morn|ing
following.</P>
<P>Behold her then on the eve of appear|ing,
be&s;ides an apartment at three guineas
a week, with a carriage and two footmen,
on an income of le&s;s than an hundred
pounds a year.</P>
<P>Perfect madne&s;s!&mdash;I readily grant it, and
it would be happy for &s;ociety, if this mad|ne&s;s
was confined to the young, the inex|perienced,
the &s;anguine, bo&s;om of our he|roine;
who&s;e reliance, however ill founded,
on Lord Melvile's honourable pa&s;&s;ion was
&s;uch, that &s;he thought a month the longe&s;t
time this imprudent expence could conti|nue;
<PB N="166" REF="165">
nay, &s;he determined it &s;hould be the
longe&s;t, and re&s;olved ab&s;olutely to leave
London the latter end of March, if &s;he was
not before that time Lady Melvile.</P>
<P>She al&s;o con&s;idered that, if nece&s;&s;ary, &s;he
had a con&s;iderable &s;um in bank in her port|manteau:
&s;he e&s;timated her epic poem at
100<HI>l.,</HI> her novel at 200<HI>l.,</HI> and her play,
including the copy, at 500<HI>l.;</HI> on the whole
800<HI>l.:</HI> a &s;um, in the aggregate, to which
the little additional expences &s;he was going
to incur bore no manner of proportion.</P>
<P>She had &s;ome little debts to milliners,
hairdre&s;&s;ers, &amp;c. but they were trifles; &s;he
had money remaining in her bureau; into
the preci&s;e &s;um &s;he had not had the courage

<P>It was of importance that &s;he &s;hould

<P>She was impatient for &s;ix o'clock; &s;ix

<P><PB N="168" REF="167">
Maria was ab&s;orbed in expectation; &s;he

the entertainment &s;he was going to receive.</P>
<P>She had heard much of the tragedy which

<P>The fir&s;t act pa&s;&s;ed, the &s;econd began:
the hero and heroine of the piece had not
yet appeared; Maria expected them with
the warme&s;t impatience.</P>
<P>The beautiful de&s;cription of the tri|umphant
entry of the royal pair, a de&s;crip|tion

adorned with all the flowery charms of
diction, rai&s;ed her ideas of the bright

de&s;criptive colouring, in this in&s;tance, ri|valed

<P>The bright Loui&s;a of the theatre ap|peared;
&s;he came forward.</P>

She found her judgement &s;atisfied, but

<P>She felt the &s;tronge&s;t degree of approba|tion,

<P>The part of Loui&s;a was fine writing, de|livered

Maria's cheeks were &s;uffu&s;ed with crim&s;on

her in the following terms:</P>
<P>&startq;I have read your tragedy, young lady,

the conduct &s;uch as the &s;evere&s;t

painted in the mo&s;t glowing colours, and
the &s;tyle even luxuriantly poetical; but

<P>&startq;But, alas! you have many difficulties to
&s;urmount, of which you have not at pre|&s;ent

be a&s;toni&s;hed when I tell you, it requires
no &s;mall degree of intere&s;t even to get

<P>&startq;No, my dear madam, I will take upon

<P>Maria was delighted with the fir&s;t part of
this &s;peech; the latter &s;he looked on as the
peevi&s;hne&s;s of age, and perhaps of di&s;ap|pointment.</P>

<P>ON the third day from his leaving Lon|don,
Lord Claremont, with his &s;on,

<P>We &s;hould have premi&s;ed that <HI>la petite

<P>The noble ma&s;ter of this &s;uperb man&s;ion
led Dorignon through a &s;uite of magnificent
apartments, once honoured by other gue&s;ts,
and, entering the dining-room, placed her at
the head of his table, of which he de&s;ired
her to do the honours.</P>
<P><PB N="186" REF="187">
Lord Melvile blu&s;hed, a &s;park of virtue
&s;till remained unextingui&s;hed in his bo&s;om;
his degenerate pa&s;&s;ions had not entirely con|quered
the faithful monitor within; his
heart revolted to &s;ee this wretched woman
occupy the &s;eat once filled by his noble, his
amiable, mother.</P>
<P>He ate little, he was gloomy, he was &s;i|lent;
the &s;prightly &s;allies of Dorignon
mi&s;&s;ed of their u&s;ual effect.</P>
<P>He looked up, the picture of Lady Clare|mont
met his eyes; the blood ru&s;hed to his
heart, a tear of remor&s;e &s;tarted, he fancied
he &s;aw the picture glow with indignation;
he ro&s;e from table, pretended illne&s;s, and
retired.</P>
<P>Neither Dorignon, nor Lord Claremont,
had the lea&s;t idea of the cau&s;e of Lord
Melvile's emotion, though it was too ob|vious
<PB N="187" REF="188">
to e&s;cape the eyes of either: both
were &s;urprized at his retiring; but, as Lord
Claremont took no notice of his ab&s;ence,
Dorignon thought it prudent to ob&s;erve the
&s;ame conduct.</P>
<P>No other vi&s;ible cau&s;e appearing, the
convivial trio imagined his lord&s;hip's preci|pitate
retreat aro&s;e from his jealou&s;y of the
We&s;t Indian, who, full of the &s;ame idea,
enjoyed his &s;uppo&s;ed triumph over a rival
in every re&s;pect &s;o much his &s;uperior.</P>
<P>The dinner, the wines, were exqui&s;ite;
the gla&s;s went round; Dorignon, convinced
&s;he had riveted Lord Melvile's chains more
firmly than ever, di&s;played all the charms
of her <HI>&s;&ccedil;avoir vivre;</HI> &s;he was &s;inging a
<HI>chan&s;on &agrave; boire</HI> when a &s;ervant informed the
company that Lord Melvile had &s;et out for
London in ten minutes after he left the
room.</P>
<P><PB N="188" REF="189">
Dorignon did not expect this &s;troke; it
di&s;concerted all her mea&s;ures; &s;he he&s;itated
what &s;tep to take, turned alternately red and
pale, and was on the point of propo&s;ing to
follow him, when Lord Claremont, who
cho&s;e to di&s;&s;emble his &s;urprize, told her his
&s;on was gone to town by his order, on &s;ome
unfore&s;een bu&s;ine&s;s of great importance to
him&s;elf; but that he and Mr. Martin, the
name of her new lover, would do all in
their power to amu&s;e her till Lord Melvile's
return, which he &s;uppo&s;ed would be in
about a week.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IX.</HEAD>
<P>LORD Melvile, on leaving the dining-room,
retired to his own apartment,
his heart torn by contending pa&s;&s;ions, which
bani&s;hed peace from his agitated bo&s;om; he
de&s;pi&s;ed him&s;elf for his attachment to &s;o un|worthy
an object as Dorignon, yet felt not
the le&s;s &s;trongly the a&s;cendant &s;he had
gained over his heart.</P>
<P>He &s;aw no alternative between &s;ubmit|ting
to re&s;ume his inglorious chains, and &s;et|ting
out that moment for London: his in|clination
pointed out the fir&s;t; but &s;hame,
remor&s;e, his re&s;pect for the memory of his
noble mother, and perhaps a mixture of
jealou&s;y and de&s;pight, carried it for the
latter.</P>
<P>He found &s;ome difficulty in taking this
laudable re&s;olution, and, con&s;cious of his
<PB N="190" REF="191">
own weakne&s;s, determined on &s;etting out
without &s;eeing Dorignon, and without giv|ing
his indignation time to cool.</P>
<P>He threw him&s;elf into the chai&s;e, and
drove from the door; he looked back, hap|pily
for him, his Circ&eacute; was not in &s;ight.</P>
<P>The chai&s;e drove on; Lord Melvile had
courage to per&s;evere in advancing, though
Dorignon's idea perpetually obtruded it&s;elf
on his imagination; the charms of her form
indeed were not &s;uch as ju&s;tified his infatua|tion;
&s;he was, in re&s;pect to per&s;onal attrac|tions,
much below mediocrity; but her
&s;prightly &s;allies, her <HI>&s;&ccedil;avoir vivre,</HI> her <HI>pi|quantes
caprices;</HI> her unbounded, her liber|tine
vivacity, unfettered by the chains of
either politene&s;s, decency, or good-nature;
her dexterity in varying the &s;cene from
&s;torm to &s;un&s;hine, from rage to &s;oftne&s;s;
in &s;hort, tho&s;e wretched artifices to which
beauty need not, and probity will not, de|&s;cend,
<PB N="191" REF="192">
held him in a &s;tate of willing &s;la|very,
from which he &s;carce had firmne&s;s of
mind enough to attempt getting relea&s;ed.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="10" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. X.</HEAD>
<P>LORD Melvile reached Grantham that
night, though very late; he &s;at down
and wrote to Dorignon; he upbraided, he
&s;oothed, he upbraided again; he tore the
letter; he determined to break his chains.</P>
<P>He reflected on his life of gallantry; he
was di&s;&s;atisfied; he blu&s;hed for the indeli|cacy
of his pa&s;t attachments; he deter|mined
to renounce the pur&s;uit of venal
beauty.</P>
<P>He wi&s;hed to be beloved, to &s;eek an affair
of the heart; he did well; refinement in
<PB N="192" REF="193">
vice is one &s;tep, and no incon&s;iderable one,
towards virtue.</P>
<P>This train of thinking naturally led him
to remember the blooming, the amiable,
the lovely, the innocent Maria, who, with
every charm of youth and beauty which the
abandoned Dorignon wanted, had the re|commendation
of having di&s;tingui&s;hed him
from all his &s;ex; &s;he had convinced him of
her unaffected tenderne&s;s by endeavouring to
conceal it, and by a thou&s;and little circum|&s;tances,
which, though &s;ufficiently percepti|ble,
are difficult to de&s;cribe.</P>
<P>He therefore determined on pur&s;uing his
conque&s;t, and de&s;tined Mi&s;s Villiers to the
honour of being his favourite &s;ultana, as
&s;oon as decency, after his marriage, would
allow him to make an arrangement.</P>
<P>His heart, for a moment, revolted at the
idea of &s;eduction; but he &s;oon-&s;ilenced the
unwelcome monitor.</P>
<P><PB N="193" REF="194">
He was born with better feelings; he was
naturally humane, tender, compa&s;&s;ionate;
but he had, unfortunately for him&s;elf, been
educated by a father, who, as we have al|ready
ob&s;erved, had taken the mo&s;t unwea|ried
pains to eradicate from his expanding
mind tho&s;e &s;ocial affections which the Deity
has planted in our bo&s;oms for the wi&s;e&s;t
purpo&s;es.</P>
<P>By the repeated in&s;tructions of this fa|ther,
whom he both loved and revered, he
had rea&s;oned him&s;elf into the per&s;ua&s;ion,
tha$ there exi&s;ts no real principle of action
but what is merely &s;elfi&s;h; and that the fir&s;t,
indeed the only, duty of every being, is to
pur&s;ue its own particular gratification.</P>
<P>In re&s;pect to the other &s;ex, his reverend
Mentor had a&s;&s;ured him, that woman is as
much de&s;tined, by the Creator, the prey of
man, as the lamb of the wolf; and that
<PB N="194" REF="195">
compunction was as little required, and
would be as contrary to the rule of right,
and the e&s;tabli&s;hed order of nature, in the
one pur&s;uit as in the other.</P>
<P>Allow me to ob&s;erve, that immorality in the
extreme, that abandoned &s;tate of mind, in the
compo&s;ition of which hardne&s;s of heart makes
a nece&s;&s;ary ingredient, is &s;eldom attained by
the young. Pure, unmixed, unfeeling de|pravity
is the glorious privilege of age.</P>
<P>Lord Melvile's heart, that faithful ad|vi&s;er
when we obey its cooler dictates, told
him the&s;e principles were erroneous; but
he had been directed to &s;tudy morals, as
a &s;cience, in the admirable writings of the
new French philo&s;ophers; a race, who, di&s;|&s;atisfied
with the beauteous workman&s;hip of
heaven, have endeavoured, to the utmo&s;t
extent of their limited abilities, to mould
human nature into a form as di&s;torted, and
as different from that which the great Crea|tor
<PB N="195" REF="196">
gave it, as the head of a North Ameri|can
&s;avage, or the foot of a Chine&s;e woman
of quality.</P>

&s;uch meritorious pains to convince mankind
they are on a level with the bea&s;ts that pe|ri&s;h!

<P>Free-thinking, to take this re&s;pectable

A few young men, indeed, like Lord
Melvile, catch it on the rebound at Paris,
whither it has travelled with our one-hor&s;e

on principles which appeared to him at

it was not for his intended bride, who
might for aught he knew, as he had never

her exchequer, <HI>that</HI> was in a melancholy

<P>John, being called upon, produced her
bills; which, including mercer, milliner,

Drury-Lane would more than pay it.</P>

&s;o extremely in her own disfavour, her new

by an involuntary, and to her&s;elf almo&s;t
unperceived, impul&s;e, &s;he &s;tarted from her
&s;eat, and met him in the middle of the
room.</P>
<P>His triumphant &s;mile of gratified vanity
brought her back, for a moment, to com|mon
&s;en&s;e; &s;he recollected &s;he was violating

to her chair.</P>
<P>Lord Melvile &s;eated him&s;elf by her,
without &s;eeming to know there was any
other per&s;on in the room.</P>
<P>His foftened tone of voice, the plea&s;ure
vi&s;ible in his eyes, Mi&s;s Villiers's apparent
confu&s;ion, the glance of tenderne&s;s &s;he could
not conceal, all tended to confirm ideas un|favourable
to the honour of our heroine;
and might indeed have ju&s;tified them in
<PB N="204" REF="205">
minds much more inclined to candor than
any pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>The point was now decided; nothing
could be more clear; &s;he had refu&s;ed to
play in expectation of her lover&mdash;the cha|riot

unveiled.</P>
<P>Swift as the electrical fire, the malignant
whi&s;per ran from table to table.</P>
<P>Detraction, however, had not yet ventured
to &s;peak her own genuine language; &s;he
had employed only the &s;mall &s;till voice of
timid &s;u&s;picion.</P>
<P>She had ju&s;t appeared, glided lightly
round the rooms, and retired.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XIII.</HEAD>
<P>LORD Melvile had arrived in Gro&s;ve|nor-&s;treet
at one; had dre&s;&s;ed, and
dined at home alone.</P>
<P>He found his hou&s;e a de&s;$$$ without the
enlivening caprices of Dorignon.</P>
<P>He traver&s;ed the apartments, where &s;oli|tude
and &s;ilence reigned.</P>
<P>The fe&s;tive board, the lively repartee,
the &s;ong, the dance, were no more.</P>
<P>He felt an involuntary &s;adne&s;s, which he
determined to remove by di&s;&s;ipation.</P>
<P>He ordered his chair, called at the Pan|theon,
&s;poke to &s;ome of his friends, engaged
him&s;elf to &s;up with Lady B. heard half a
&s;ong, and found his melancholy increa&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="206" REF="207">
His bo&s;om &s;till felt a frightful void; the
image of Dorignon &s;till haunted him; &s;he
&s;till occupied a heart accu&s;tomed to her
chains; Mi&s;s Villiers alone could di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;s
her.</P>
<P>To Mi&s;s Villiers's lodgings, therefore, he
directed his chairmen; where being in|formed
&s;he was at Lady Hardy's a&s;&s;embly,
he re&s;olved on honouring this amiable re|lict
with a vi&s;it.</P>
<P>Thus much by way of parenthe&s;is, and
we proceed.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="14" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. XIV.</HEAD>
<P>LADY Hardy, who had overheard
&s;ome good-natured conjectures in re|&s;pect
to her young friend, was exceedingly
<PB N="207" REF="208">
alarmed; not for her young friend, but for
her&s;elf; for her own honour, and the im|maculate
reputation of her a&s;&s;emblies.</P>
<P>To the fame, as well as to the happine&s;s,
of Mi&s;s Villiers, con&s;idered ab&s;tractedly as
Mi&s;s Villiers, &s;he was mo&s;t &s;toically indif|ferent;
but to what might be &s;aid to her
di&s;advantage as the acquaintance of Lady
Hardy, and by Lady Hardy introduced into
the fa&s;hionable world, &s;he was even trem|blingly
alive.</P>
<P>She had found her one <HI>whom nobody
knew,</HI> and had produced her as a woman of
character and fa&s;hion to this re&s;pectable
&s;et, to whom &s;he was therefore re&s;pon&s;ible
for all which might happen.</P>
<P>She was &s;en&s;ible her own &s;ituation in the
ever-varying region of <HI>bon ton</HI> was a fabrick
rai&s;ed on a very &s;andy foundation; and
that, if the lea&s;t atom &s;hould give way, the
<PB N="208" REF="209">
whole &s;uper&s;tructure would probably fall
to the ground.</P>
<P>She had no other choice remaining than
either to &s;upport Mi&s;s Villiers as a per&s;on
of family and character, for who&s;e conduct
&s;he dare be an&s;werable; or to give her up
as a little adventurer, who had deceived
her, and was unworthy her future protec|tion.</P>
<P>Had &s;he been able to develop Lord Mel|vile's
real intentions in re&s;pect to this lovely
girl, &s;he would have found no difficulty in
taking her mea&s;ures: but his behaviour was
to the la&s;t degree equivocal; he &s;eemed to
like her, he &s;hewed her the mo&s;t pointed,
the mo&s;t re&s;pectful attention; and the ac|count
Mrs. Merrick had given of Mi&s;s
Villiers's birth and connexions, &s;eemed to &s;et
her above any addre&s;s incon&s;i&s;tent with ho|nour.</P>
<P><PB N="209" REF="210">
The good lady was, it mu&s;t be ob&s;erved,
a &s;tranger to his lord&s;hip's treaty with the
nabob's daughter, which the trump of
Fame had not yet announced to the world.</P>
<P>This important &s;ecret, had &s;he known
it, would have determined her conduct in a
moment; but &s;he could not give up the
flattering idea of &s;eeing her hou&s;e graced
with the pre&s;ence of Lady Melvile, who
with &s;uch per&s;onal attractions, if this very
probable event &s;hould take place, mu&s;t in|fallibly
be &s;oon at the head of the fa&s;hion|able
world.</P>
<P>In this perplexing uncertainty, as her
oracle, Captain Wil&s;on, happened not to
be pre&s;ent to give her his opinion, &s;he
thought it mo&s;t prudent to endeavour at &s;i|lencing
the ri&s;ing murmur of &s;lander, by
drawing Lord Melvile's attention from
Maria, and engaging him in conver&s;ation
her&s;elf.</P>
<P><PB N="210" REF="211">
&startq;Did your lord&s;hip look in at the Pan|theon?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I did, madam, and &s;taid about five mi|nutes.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Was there much company, my lord?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;A great number of people, madam,
and &s;ome that one knew. Lady B&mdash;was
there, and looked like a divinity.&endq;</P>
<P>(Here Mi&s;s Villiers changed colour, and
his lord&s;hip proceeded.)</P>
<P>&startq;One goes every where &s;ometimes, but I
dete&s;t the Pantheon; 'tis the temple of
<HI>ennui</HI>&mdash;'tis a church over a charnel|hou&s;e.&endq;</P>

&s;ettle a di&s;pute about a renounce at a whi&s;t|table
<PB N="211" REF="212">
in another room, Lord Melvile, after
talking about five minutes in a half-whi&s;per
to our heroine, ro&s;e rather abruptly, and
de&s;ired his chair to be called.</P>
<P>Our heroine (truth obliges us to confe&s;s
her inconceivable indi&s;cretion) ro&s;e at the
&s;ame in&s;tant; and the hall re-echoed with
&startq;Mi&s;s Villiers's carriage and &s;ervants!&endq;</P>
<P>A thou&s;and enquiring glances followed
them (for they went together) through the
<HI>&s;uite</HI> of apartments; a thou&s;and mouths,
eager to &s;peak, opened at once; a thou|&s;and
faded countenances bloomed anew with
a momentary glow of malevolent delight.</P>
<P>The potent godde&s;s of detraction now
returned triumphant to the charge, ex|panded
her du&s;ky pinions unappalled, and
&s;hed her venom on each antiquated bo&s;om.</P>

Three hoary Sibyls formed a private con|clave,

&startq;Pray, madam, who is this paragon of

<P>Half the company at the card-tables
wi&s;hed their re&s;pective parties at an end,
that they might be at liberty to inve&s;tigate
this weighty affair.</P>
<P>Lady Bla&s;t left her pool, unfini&s;hed, to

door.</P>
<P>Had &s;he waited three minutes longer,
&s;he would have &s;een him go away, as he
was engaged to &s;up with the beautiful Lady
B&mdash;; but that was not the point at which
&s;he aimed.</P>
<P>She hurried home, and di&s;patched cards
to a dozen of her female friends (a venera|ble
band, who had figured forty years be|fore
as her &s;i&s;ter demi-reps), to drink cho|colate
with her at twelve the next morning.</P>
