<HEAD>Some farther Account OF THE Original Di&s;putes In <HI>IRELAND,</HI> &amp;c,</HEAD>
<P>_I Need make no Apology for my En|quiries into this Affair, with one who was entirely a Stranger, &s;ee|ing he was no Stranger to the Thing I enquir'd after: It is enough to &s;ay, that meeting with a &s;en&s;ible and intelligent Per&s;on, <HI>one of the People call'd</HI> QUAKERS, and who came lately from <HI>Dublin,</HI> and falling into an Acquaintance with him, he occa&s;ionally menti|on'd the Heats and Wrangling which they had very unhappily fallen into in <HI>Ireland,</HI> about the Currency of <HI>Copper-Money</HI> there.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="3">
I had indeed, a long time wi&s;h'd for &s;uch an Opportunity to talk with &s;omebody or other on that Subject, for I always believ'd what I am now confirm'd in, <HI>namely,</HI> that we never had a true, or at be&s;t, not a full Account of that Matter; and I that always lov'd to keep one Ear open, and if po&s;&s;ible, to hear both Sides of a Que&s;tion, had for &s;ome time &s;u&s;pended my Judgment in this Ca&s;e, in hopes that I &s;hou'd one time or other come to hear more of it.</P>
<P>In con&s;equence of this Re&s;erve of my Thoughts I told the hone&s;t QUAKER, I &s;hou'd be very glad to have a full Account of that Affair, and ask'd him, if he had been acquainted with it? He gravely reply'd, Why truly I am well acquainted with it, Friend; but I find the Peo|ple of <HI>England</HI> neither well acquainted with it, or willing to be inform'd: They are not all &s;o, <HI>&s;aid I,</HI> for I am very de&s;irous to be inform'd of it; and then I told him what I have &s;aid above, of my &s;o long wi&s;hing for a full Account, and believing we had not been well us'd in it before.</P>
<P>Truly Friend, <HI>&s;ays he, thou</HI> ha&s;t judg'd rightly as to <HI>thy</HI> having heard but Part of this Story; but I fear <HI>thy</HI> Patience will not &s;erve <HI>thee</HI> to hear the whole, for <HI>verily</HI> it will take up much Time, e&s;pecially in my &s;low Way of &s;peaking.</P>
<P>Well, I pre&s;s'd him to give me a full Account of it, a&s;&s;uring him, that I had as much Pati|ence as Curio&s;ity; and that, <HI>in a word,</HI> I had &s;o much De&s;ire to hear it, that I cou'd not want
<PB N="5" REF="4">
Patience, if it held all Night, de&s;iring him not to &s;horten any Part of; upon which he under|took it, <HI>and began thus:</HI></P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t he told me,</HI> That he &s;uppos'd the chief In|formation I had receiv'd of that Affair, was, from the Votes and Re&s;olves of the Parliament of <HI>Ireland,</HI> and their &s;everal Addre&s;&s;es to the King; <HI>I told him,</HI> It was &s;o, including only two or three Letters, or Adverti&s;ements, publi&s;h'd by way of Libel, or Pamphlet, in &s;ome of our publick Papers.</P>
<P><HI>In truth,</HI> Friend, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> I &s;aw tho&s;e Papers too, but they &s;eem'd to be written by &s;ome Hand as ignorant as officious; &s;o that I &s;hou'd almo&s;t think, tho&s;e which argued again&s;t the Copper-Money, were hir'd by the Adver&s;ary to expo&s;e the Cau&s;e, and give Advantages again&s;t them&s;elves.</P>
<P>Well, <HI>&s;aid I,</HI> but what &s;ay you to the Pro|ceedings in the Parliament of <HI>Ireland?</HI></P>
<P>As for that, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> e'en let <HI>thee</HI> and I lay them a&s;ide for the pre&s;ent; <HI>verily,</HI> they need not &s;o much as be nam'd in the Ca&s;e; neither &s;hall I have any Occa&s;ion <HI>to &s;peak of them</HI> in all my Di&s;cour&s;e, except only as <HI>thou</HI> &s;ee&s;t I do now, <HI>namely,</HI> to let <HI>thee</HI> know, that <HI>I do not &s;peak of them.</HI></P>
<P>Tho&s;e A&s;&s;emblies, <HI>added he,</HI> which <HI>ye</HI> call <HI>Parlia|ments,</HI> are Numbers of Men call'd together by our Government, to make and amend Laws, redre&s;s
<PB N="6" REF="5">
the Grievances, and do divers Things which are needful to be done; but they are compos'd of fallible Men, and I will not &s;ay they cannot Err, and be Mi&s;taken, even in their Parliament Ca|pacity; whether they have been now mi&s;taken, or impos'd upon by &s;ubtle Men from Without-Doors, is not my pre&s;ent Bu&s;ine&s;s to &s;ay, or <HI>thine</HI> to enquire; to which I gave a little <HI>Hum,</HI> with like Gravity, <HI>and &s;o he went on.</HI></P>
<P><HI>He told me then,</HI> That I mu&s;t therefore learn to di&s;tingui&s;h in this Affair, between what was done in Parliament, and what was done out of Parliament; for indeed, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> the Scheme of all this Matter was laid, and much tran&s;acted, before the Parliament came together, and con|&s;equently what happen'd in Parliament, cou'd not be the Cau&s;e of what Oppo&s;ition was re&s;olv'd on, becau&s;e then it mu&s;t act before it had a Be|ing; whether what was done in Parliament, was an Effect con&s;equent to what went before? <HI>Of that, Friend,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>judge Thou.</HI></P>
<P>Nor, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> have you in <HI>England</HI> been only mi|&s;taken, by turning your Eyes to the Votes of Par|liament, and to &s;ome fooli&s;h weak Papers, where one Part of the Fact is repre&s;ented, and the o|ther taken no Notice of; by which means your Judgments are bia&s;s'd, and prepo&s;&s;e&s;s'd, in Fa|vour of that which is mo&s;t popular: But <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> if I am not mi&s;taken, <HI>thou</HI> art, and the People here in <HI>England</HI> have been amus'd, and led quite be&s;ide the Que&s;tion; <HI>ye</HI> are taken up in di&s;cu&s;&s;ing the Terms of the Grant; calculating the Value of the New Coin; the Profits of the Patentee; and
<PB N="7" REF="6">
the Advantage, or Di&s;advantage, which accrues to the Kingdom of <HI>Ireland</HI> by this <HI>Copper-Mo|ney;</HI> in all which Di&s;putes and Calculations, <HI>adds my Friend,</HI> the <HI>Men of Art,</HI> thy <HI>Sons of Figures and Cyphers</HI> are mo&s;t extreamly wrong, as I may tell <HI>thee</HI> hereafter.</P>
<P>But there is, <HI>adds he,</HI> a previous Que&s;tion, which &s;hou'd have been fir&s;t determin'd; and that is, <HI>What the main Que&s;tion is?</HI> for verily we are by no means agreed about that yet, and till that is an&s;wer'd, all the re&s;t is beating the Air, and dancing in a Circle.</P>
<P>Why, <HI>&s;ays I,</HI> the main Que&s;tion (as I under|&s;tand it) is, Whether the Farthings and Half|pence are prejudicial, de&s;tructive, and dangerous to the People of <HI>Ireland,</HI> or whether they are not?</P>
<P>No, no, Friend <HI>&s;ays my</HI> QUAKER, <HI>thou</HI> art mi&s;taken quite, that is a Que&s;tion, (and I may &s;ay &s;omething to that al&s;o hereafter) but that is not the main Que&s;tion to be di&s;cu&s;s'd, or which was fir&s;t di&s;cus'd among us, in order to come at a clear Under&s;tanding of this Matter.</P>
<P>Why, <HI>&s;aid I,</HI> this was the Que&s;tion debated and re&s;olv'd in your Parliament.</P>
<P>I tell <HI>thee, &s;aid he &s;omewhat pecvi&s;hly,</HI> I am not &s;peaking of the Parliament; I wou'd not have them &s;o much as nam'd, or any-thing done by them, mention'd; I am &s;earching deeper into this Wound, than tho&s;e State-Surgeons cou'd go, and
<PB N="8" REF="7">
enquiring into what was before their Sitting, <HI>I mean in their la&s;t Sitting;</HI> therefore let them be no more &s;poken of in it.</P>
<P>Well, <HI>&s;ays I,</HI> then the Que&s;tion mu&s;t be, whe|ther the People of <HI>Ireland</HI> are willing to receive the&s;e Farthings and Halfpence, or not; or whe|ther they are illegally and arbitrarily impos'd up|on them.</P>
<P>No, no, Friend, <HI>&s;ays the</HI> QUAKER, <HI>thou</HI> art &s;till out of the right Way, <HI>thou</HI> wilt never come at the Bottom of the Bu&s;ine&s;s, by the&s;e Enqui|ries; for in that the Patent will an&s;wer <HI>thee,</HI> and the People of <HI>Ireland</HI> will an&s;wer <HI>thee</HI> in the other: <HI>Then he added with &s;ome Warmth,</HI> The Farthings and Halfpence were not forc'd upon <HI>us illegally,</HI> or <HI>arbitrarily,</HI> for they were not forc'd upon <HI>us</HI> at-all: The Patent (or Grant) gave no Power to <HI>impo&s;e them;</HI> neither were WE in <HI>Ire|land</HI> oblig'd to take one Ounce of them, unle&s;s we freely and willingly (and by our own Choice) agreed to take them. <HI>On the contrary,</HI> the Peo|ple, <HI>as they</HI> extreamly wanted them, <HI>&s;o they</HI> uni|ver&s;ally approv'd of them: I a&s;&s;ure <HI>thee,</HI> I have not heard of one Gain&s;ayer, or that offer'd to make the lea&s;t Complaint again&s;t them, 'till they had been current, and pa&s;t as Current-money a|mong us, for &s;everal Months.</P>
<P>What then is the Ca&s;e, <HI>&s;aid I,</HI> for you &s;eem &s;omething my&s;terious about it?</P>
<P>Why, the main Que&s;tion, <HI>Friend, &s;ays he,</HI> was, whether the Patent was rightly granted? And &s;o
<PB N="9" REF="8">
the Quarrel was a Debate of Intere&s;t, and lay be|tween <HI>William Wood,</HI> the pre&s;ent Patentee, and <HI>&s;ome other Per&s;ons,</HI> who laid their Hands upon it, in their Imagination: This, I &s;ay, is the Debate, and may be &s;tated thus, <HI>viz.</HI> Whether the Coin|age of <HI>Copper-Money, being very profitable in it&s;elf,</HI> &s;hou'd continue to the &s;aid <HI>William Wood,</HI> to whom the King had granted it, or whether it wou'd not be much better to &s;et him a&s;ide, and get it for <HI>our &s;elves.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Hum! &s;aid I again,</HI> but who do you mean by <HI>our &s;elves?</HI></P>
<P>Nay, <HI>&s;ays the</HI> QUAKER, but <HI>thou</HI> may'&s;t not enquire too far into the Secrets of others, that is not right; howbeit, I may (perhaps) open &s;ome Part of the Matter unto <HI>thee,</HI> in the latter End of the Story; for I do not &s;ay, that the Men have no Names, nor do I &s;ay, that their Names are not known al&s;o: But of that al&s;o in its Place.</P>
<P>I begin to under&s;tand you, Friend, <HI>&s;ays I,</HI> and if I am right, you would have us believe, that there was an original De&s;ign, or Con&s;piracy, a|mong a Sett of Per&s;ons in <HI>Ireland; in &s;hort,</HI> to &s;up|plant Mr. <HI>Wood,</HI> get his Patent &s;et a&s;ide, and af|terward to get a Grant of it for them&s;elves.</P>
<P>Verily, <HI>thou ha&s;t &s;aid, &s;ays the</HI> QUAKER, but I did not tell <HI>thee,</HI> that I wou'd have <HI>thee</HI> believe me; for of what Con&s;equence is it to me, <HI>Friend, &s;ays he,</HI> when I talk to <HI>thee</HI> of the&s;e Things, whe|ther <HI>thou</HI> believe&s;t me or no?</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="9">
Well, well, <HI>&s;ays I,</HI> I &s;ee you are &s;earching it to the Bottom indeed; pray go on with your Story then, and I will not interrupt you any more with my Enquiries: So he went on indeed, in a &s;urprizing manner, <HI>to me;</HI> and by which I was fully convinc'd, that really we in <HI>England</HI> had all-along taken this Affair by the wrong Handle, had &s;een it in a fal&s;e Light, and that in|deed we knew nothing at-all of the Matter.</P>
<P>He then went on, I &s;ay, and repeating to me the general Satisfaction with which the People of <HI>Ireland</HI> (as he had &s;aid before) fir&s;t receiv'd the Farthings and Halfpence; <HI>he told me,</HI> they did receive them, as Things they had not only a good Opinion of, but as what they were in great Want of; that after the fir&s;t News of the Grant, and that the Coining of them was in hand, which was &s;ome time before they arriv'd, the People were very impatient for their coming, and often expre&s;s'd their Concern, le&s;t the Coinage &s;hou'd not go forward; that this did not ari&s;e from the u&s;ual Eagerne&s;s of People after Novelty, but from the real Want the Country was in of &s;mall Money, for the Supply of petty Ca&s;h, Ex|change of larger Species, for buying Provi&s;ions in &s;mall Quantities, and for all the other Occa|&s;ions, in which &s;mall Money is u&s;ually made u&s;e of.</P>
<P><HI>He told me,</HI> that as &s;oon as the Copper-Mo|ney appear'd, it met with a general Approbation; the People took it with &s;o free a Con&s;ent, that it became univer&s;ally current: There was no Ob|jections
<PB N="11" REF="10">
rais'd, either again&s;t its Figure, which was very beautiful, or the Workman&s;hip, which was compleat, or the Value and Finene&s;s of the Metal, which (it was well known) the Grant it &s;elf had provided for, and which in Appear|ance &s;eem'd to be &s;uch as was rea&s;onable, and duely proportion'd to the Nature of the thing, and to the U&s;age in other Parts of the King's Do|minions, in like Ca&s;es.</P>
<P>It is true, <HI>he &s;aid,</HI> they were &s;omething LIGHTER than the <HI>Farthings</HI> and <HI>Halfpence</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> but then, <HI>he added,</HI> they were HEAVIER than the <HI>Bodles</HI> and <HI>Baubees</HI> in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and there was ju&s;t Rea&s;ons to be given for the Difference in both; but, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> of that I &s;hall talk far|ther with <HI>thee</HI> hereafter.</P>
<P>Then he went on to tell me, that this general Approbation of the People continued a great|while; for verily <HI>Friend, &s;ays he,</HI> we very &s;en&s;i|bly felt the Ea&s;e they were to us in Trade; the Shop-keepers (in particular) felt the Advantage in their Retail Bu&s;ine&s;s; and it was impo&s;&s;ible we cou'd act again&s;t our Light, &s;o as to com|plain of that which we &s;o univer&s;ally rejoic'd at: I &s;ay, <HI>he affirm'd,</HI> that this general Approba|tion of the People continued a great-while, and that even when Complaints began to be heard, they had not their beginning among the trading Part of the Nation: Nay, <HI>he told me, and bid me remark it,</HI> that &s;ome of tho&s;e very Per&s;ons who afterwards appear'd to be concern'd mo&s;t vi|olently again&s;t the Copper-Farthings, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> were for &s;ome time the mo&s;t forward to approve of
<PB N="12" REF="11">
them, and applaud the Advantage, which ac|crued to the Publick by them; that they were Advocates on all publick Occa&s;ions for the Pa|tentee; appear'd extreamly pleas'd that the Coin obtain'd &s;o general a Currency in Trade, and that the People were &s;o well &s;atisfy'd with it; and, <HI>&s;ays he in his rough Way,</HI> whether they LY'D then, or &s;ince, they know be&s;t.</P>
<P>Well but, <HI>&s;ays I,</HI> art <HI>thou</HI> well &s;atisfy'd, or can'&s;t <HI>thou</HI> make it appear, that the&s;e Men did not change their Opinion, 'till, <HI>as thou &s;ay'&s;t,</HI> they form'd a Con&s;piracy to &s;upplant Mr. <HI>Wood</HI>'s Patent.</P>
<P>Nay, <HI>Friend, &s;ays he, thou</HI> do&s;t not u&s;e me fair|ly now; for that is to put me upon the Proof of Hours and Minutes, when Things were done, which were done in the Dark; for as <HI>thou</HI> ha&s;t call'd it a <HI>Con&s;piracy, (which 1 did not)</HI> it mu&s;t then be &s;ecret, and I cannot &s;peak to Minutes; but 'tis enough to &s;ay, <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> That tho&s;e very Men did &s;ome time after rai&s;e Clamours, and bring evil Ac|cu&s;ations again&s;t the Grant for <HI>Farthings</HI> and <HI>Half|pence,</HI> again&s;t the Coin it&s;elf, and again&s;t <HI>thy</HI> Friend, <HI>William Wood,</HI> the Patentee, to whom the Privilege is granted. And, <HI>Secondly,</HI> That &s;ome Per&s;ons have propos'd to get a Grant to them|&s;elves, and &s;et up &s;uch another Coinage on their own Account, as &s;oon as this can be &s;et a&s;ide: This, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> I believe they will put no-body to the Trouble of proving.</P>
<P>Then he gave me a long Account of the Per|&s;ons concern'd, the Mea&s;ures concerted, and the
<PB N="13" REF="12">
Advantages propos'd by tho&s;e People, who, <HI>as he &s;aid,</HI> were thus engag'd again&s;t Mr. <HI>Wood</HI>'s Patent, and by what Arts they propos'd to bring it before the King, in order to obtain the recalling Mr. <HI>Wood</HI>'s Grant: When I wou'd have ask'd him, by what &s;ecret Management they had been able to bring it into Parliament, and brought the Hou&s;es to e&s;pou&s;e it, as they had done; he took me &s;hort, and &s;eem'd angry, reminding me, that he had &s;aid, he wou'd not meddle with that Part, or &s;o much as name the Parliament, in all his Di&s;cour&s;e; that he cou'd give me a &s;uffi|cient Account of the Matter without it; and that I might enquire that Part of &s;ome-body el&s;e, if I found his Relation was imperfect.</P>
<P>I pacify'd him as well as I cou'd, and brought him to go on; then he gave him&s;elf &s;ome <HI>loo&s;e</HI> at the Inju&s;tice and Unfairne&s;s of this Proceed|ing; how they abus'd the People, in laying the Complaint in their Names, who, <HI>as he &s;aid,</HI> he was well inform'd, never complain'd at all, or had any Inclination to do &s;o: Not the Privy-Council, <HI>he &s;aid,</HI> not the Lord Lieutenant, not the Mayor and Aldermen of <HI>Dublin,</HI> or of any other City, had ever any Petitions, or Repre&s;entations, a|gain&s;t the <HI>Farthings</HI> and <HI>Halfpence;</HI> no Grand-Ju|ry ever pre&s;ented them; no Merchants; <HI>in a Word, he added,</HI> that no Man, or Society of Men, open'd their Mouths again&s;t them; nay, <HI>adds he,</HI> I may &s;ay, not a Dog wagg'd his Tongue again&s;t them, 'till this Fire bur&s;t out, as from a &s;ecret Mine (like a Powder-Plot) to blow up both <HI>Patent</HI> and <HI>Patentee,</HI> in order to &s;et up an|other in its Room.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="13">
He goes on then to tell me, That this being the &s;ecret Hi&s;tory of the Thing it&s;elf, the Per|&s;ons concern'd in it were not &s;o &s;ecret, but that many People gue&s;s'd at their Names, as well as their Undertaking; and it was given out, that they were Men of &s;uch Figure and Intere&s;t, that they did not doubt they &s;hou'd obtain their Re|que&s;t, <HI>namely,</HI> To &s;et a&s;ide the <HI>Patent: He &s;aid,</HI> It was not known at fir&s;t which Way they wou'd go to work, or what Mea&s;ures they wou'd take to get this done, much le&s;s was it &s;o much as gue&s;s'd, that they wou'd get the Parliament to e&s;pou&s;e it: Nor, <HI>adds he,</HI> do I &s;ay yet, that the Parliament did appear in it, by the procuring of the&s;e Men, and therefore I &s;ay nothing to that; for he kept clo&s;e to the Point, that he wou'd not concern the Parliament in any Part of his Di&s;|cour&s;e, nor wou'd he &s;uffer me &s;o much as to name them on that Occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>Thus, <HI>he &s;aid,</HI> the fir&s;t Prejudices began in Avarice and private Intere&s;t, among a Sett of Men, who form'd their De&s;igns wholly and &s;ole|ly upon the View of their own Advantage.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as they had form'd their De&s;ign, <HI>he &s;aid,</HI> they &s;et their Wheels to work, to rai&s;e Complaints among the People, again&s;t the <HI>Cop|per-Money;</HI> and tho', <HI>he &s;aid,</HI> they went about it with the utmo&s;t Subtlety and Art, and &s;pread their empty Objections among the People, by their Agents, in &s;everal Parts of the Kingdom, yet they con'd never make any-thing of it, nor bring their <HI>Clamours</HI> to be popular; for the People
<PB N="15" REF="14">
being &s;en&s;ible of the Utility of the <HI>Copper-Money,</HI> not only by Judgment or Opinion, but by Expe|rience, and by feeling the Difference in their Trade, cou'd never be brought to join with them in their Complaints, much le&s;s to make any Ap|plication to the Government again&s;t them; tho' <HI>as he &s;aid,</HI> he was inform'd, much Endeavour was us'd to bring them to it; &s;o that, <HI>in a Word, he &s;aid,</HI> they &s;eem'd di&s;courag'd and &s;ilent again; and People began to think, they had given over the De&s;ign; but in this, <HI>he added,</HI> we were mi|&s;taken; for as Avarice is unwearied, they &s;eem'd to imitate the fam'd Re&s;olution,</P>
<P><HI>&mdash;Acheronta movebo,</HI></P>
<P><HI>Then he told me,</HI> he heard, that a little before the meeting of the Parliament, they had renew'd their Attack, and try'd &s;ome great Per&s;on; he does not &s;ay (neither was he certain) who it was, but intimates &s;ome Man of Note; and that find|ing &s;till no Encouragement (every unprejudic'd Per&s;on being again&s;t them) they gave it out, that they wou'd bring it into Parliament; and, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> I hear (&s;ince I came away) it has been brought into Parliament; but that, <HI>adds he,</HI> as al&s;o being &s;ince my arriving in <HI>England,</HI> I will have nothing to &s;ay to.</P>
<P>Here he &s;eem'd to &s;top, as if he had done, and &s;o indeed he had, as to the Hi&s;torical Part of his Account; but I, who wanted much to hear his Opinion of the Arguments on both Sides, &s;oon &s;et him on again.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="15">
But pray, <HI>&s;ays I,</HI> what had they to &s;ay again&s;t the <HI>Farthings</HI> and <HI>Halfpence?</HI> for you &s;ay they were evidently u&s;eful to the Country.</P>
<P>I did indeed, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> affirm to <HI>thee,</HI> that the People were pleas'd with them, and found them very beneficial; and I own, my Opinion is, they were really &s;o; but <HI>thou</HI> know'&s;t that greater People than I, &s;ay they are of another Opinion: Now this he &s;aid with a kind of a <HI>Grin,</HI> that in my Thoughts intimated a Contempt of tho&s;e Opinions; and then he went on, <HI>and told me,</HI> That as to the Arguments tho&s;e Men brought again&s;t the Copper-Money, before he came away; they were, <HI>he &s;aid,</HI> the weake&s;t, and mo&s;t emp|ty, that ever he cou'd have expected to have come from Men of Sence, and that they had no Weight at-all in them; and even the Com|mon People began, <HI>to u&s;e his own Words,</HI> to have them in Deri&s;ion.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, <HI>he &s;aid,</HI> they gave it out, that they were u&s;ele&s;s; that there was no Occa&s;ion for them; that Farthings and Halfpence, indefinite|ly and merely as Farthings and Halfpence, were of no Service to the Kingdom of <HI>Ireland;</HI> that they were of no Advantage to the Commerce; <HI>nay, he added,</HI> they went farther at length, for they wou'd have it be, that they were prejudi|cial and de&s;tructive to Trade; but they &s;eem'd to forget in this, that they were preparing a Mine again&s;t their own Project, and al&s;o that the common Opinion of the People was again&s;t them; and indeed, they began to expo&s;e them|&s;elves
<PB N="17" REF="16">
by it, to ridicule and Laughter; &s;eeing <HI>he &s;aid,</HI> they dropt that Part, tho' not without acknowledging it to be a Mi&s;take, and then pub|lickly own'd, that they wou'd have tho&s;e <HI>Eng|li&s;h Farthings</HI> and <HI>Halfpence</HI> cry'd down; and that they wou'd &s;upply the Country with others coin'd among them&s;elves; and to make this look a little popular, they talk'd of &s;etting to-work upon &s;ome Copper-Mines, which were formerly di&s;cover'd in their own Country.</P>
<P>This, <HI>he &s;aid,</HI> had been a little more rational, if they cou'd ha' got over two Things, <HI>namely,</HI> (1.) Upon what foot this cou'd be done, if what they had given-out before, and had not yet re|call'd, were true; <HI>namely,</HI> That meer <HI>Farthings</HI> and <HI>Halfpence</HI> were de&s;tructive to the Trade of the Kingdom. (2.) That the Kingdom had no need of them.</P>
<P>But fir&s;t, to bla&s;t the <HI>Farthings</HI> and <HI>Halfpence</HI> in general, as <HI>de&s;tructive</HI> and <HI>needle&s;s,</HI> and then tell the World, they intended to <HI>make &s;ome them|&s;elves;</HI> this was &s;o plain a Di&s;covery, <HI>he &s;aid,</HI> that whatever it did in <HI>Ireland,</HI> he ob&s;erv'd the People got hold of it here in <HI>England,</HI> and almo&s;t made a Je&s;t of the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Nation, for being &s;o gro&s;sly impos'd upon.</P>
<P>Upon this, <HI>he &s;aid,</HI> they pull'd in their Horns a little, <HI>as it were,</HI> and taking Breath, they began upon a new Sett of Arguments; but the&s;e, <HI>he &s;aid,</HI> were (in the examining them) found to be as weak, and had as little Weight in them as the other, only that indeed there was not &s;o gro&s;s an

Ab&s;urdity, nor &s;o barefac'd an In&s;ult upon the Country, in them, as in the other.</P>
<P>Then he told me, how their Emi&s;&s;aries ran up and down, exclaiming again&s;t the Inju&s;tice of putting a Coinage upon them from <HI>England;</HI> that it was an Inva&s;ion of the Liberties of the People; that it was a Monopoly, and a Piece of Arbi|trary Power; nay, &s;ome went farther, and re|flected upon the Grant it&s;elf, and con&s;equently upon the Per&s;on granting it; and that it was a dangerous Precedent at be&s;t; that the King had been impos'd upon by <HI>William Wood,</HI> and <HI>his Ac|complices;</HI> and had had the State of Affairs in <HI>Ireland</HI> very much mi&s;repre&s;ented to him, in&s;inu|ating, <HI>he &s;aid,</HI> that the King had granted this <HI>Patent,</HI> without the Advice of his Council, or without being duly inform'd of the State of Things in <HI>Ireland.</HI></P>
<P>This was a &s;ure Card, <HI>he &s;aid,</HI> to bring all the Papi&s;ts, and Enemies to the <HI>Government,</HI> into the Party, and to make them univer&s;ally Enemies to the <HI>Copper-Coinage,</HI> they being known to be forward, and glad of an Opportunity to clo&s;e with any-thing, which they think will make a Clamour at the <HI>Engli&s;h Government,</HI> or the pre&s;ent Admini&s;tration under the Reign of King <HI>GEORGE.</HI></P>
<P>This was a wicked, but a very politick Step, <HI>he &s;aid,</HI> for then (and not till then) the Com|plaint at the <HI>Engli&s;h Farthings</HI> and <HI>Halfpence</HI> be|gan to be loud, and make a Noi&s;e; and that Noi&s;e to be propagated in the remote&s;t Parts

of the Country; and thus, <HI>added he,</HI> Friend <HI>Wood</HI> &s;uffers in good Company, for the Clamour at the <HI>Farthings</HI> and <HI>Halfpence</HI> became really a Clamour at the <HI>Government.</HI></P>
<P>Well, <HI>&s;aid I,</HI> but why was this &s;o weak and &s;o empty a Complaint?</P>
<P>Why <HI>truly, &s;aid he,</HI> becau&s;e it was <HI>not Truth,</HI> and then he went of his own Accord into a Di&s;|cour&s;e upon the Merits of the <HI>Patent,</HI> and par|ticularly upon the Right the King had to grant &s;uch a <HI>Patent:</HI> The Clamour again&s;t <HI>England, he &s;aid,</HI> and particularly again&s;t the King, was not on|ly an ill-natur'd thing, but was without &s;ufficient ground; for, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> they can't deny but the Coin|age is the King's; that it is his Prerogative, and one of the ordinary Appendixes to the Right of <HI>Government;</HI> that the King (in all Nations where they have Kings reigning) appoint the Coinage of Money; that the Image and Super&s;cription tell who&s;e it is; and that <HI>Ireland,</HI> no more than <HI>England</HI> or <HI>Scotland</HI> cou'd complain again&s;t it; in both which Places, as he under&s;tood it, <HI>he &s;aid,</HI> the Coinage was appointed by the King; and particularly, <HI>Farthings</HI> and <HI>Halfpence</HI> had formerly been coin'd in <HI>England,</HI> for the Account of private Per&s;ons, and that by <HI>Patent,</HI> or <HI>Grant,</HI> in the &s;ame manner as was now in <HI>Ireland;</HI> and there|fore the granting, or appointing, &s;uch a Coinage cou'd not be illegal or arbitrary.</P>
<P>Then he took Notice of the Terms of the <HI>Pa|tent</HI> it&s;elf; the Care his Maje&s;ty had taken of the Rights and Properties of his Subjects of <HI>Ire|land,</HI>
<PB N="20" REF="19">
in the Terms of the Grant, and in the Li|mitations of the Privileges given to the <HI>Paten|tee;</HI> and as a Digre&s;&s;ion, he expre&s;s'd him&s;elf very largely, and indeed more fully than I expected from one of his Profe&s;&s;ion, in Defence of his Maje&s;ty's Conduct, and of the Mini&s;ters of State al&s;o, in this very Grant.</P>
<P>The King, <HI>he &s;aid,</HI> had &s;hewn &s;uch a Care and Concern, for the Good of all his Subjects in <HI>Ireland,</HI> as well for their Liberties, as the Pro&s;perity of their Trade, in all the Articles of this <HI>Patent,</HI> as evidently &s;hew'd, he fully un|der&s;tood the true Intere&s;t of the Kingdom, and the State of his People <HI>there;</HI> and that he neither was, or cou'd be impos'd upon by my Friend <HI>Wood,</HI> or any-one el&s;e; and &s;uch a Care as ought to make 'em a&s;ham'd (whoever they were) who had &s;ugge&s;ted to the contrary: <HI>Then he went on, and told me</HI> all the Limitations, which were in&s;erted in the <HI>Patent,</HI> by which the Fine|ne&s;s of the Metal, with the Weight and Value of the <HI>Farthings</HI> and <HI>Halfpence</HI> were a&s;certain'd, that &s;o the People might not be injur'd in either, the Quantity al&s;o to be coin'd a&s;certain'd, that they might not be glutted with an exorbi|tant Sum; and that, <HI>after all,</HI> the People were entirely left at Liberty to take <HI>them,</HI> or refu&s;e <HI>them,</HI> no Man having any Power to impo&s;e one &s;ingle <HI>Farthing</HI> or <HI>Halfpenny</HI> upon them, without their Con&s;ent.</P>
<P>Here he expatiated again upon the Difference between the mild and gentle Reign of King <HI>GEORGE,</HI> and the former Tyranny which
<PB N="21" REF="20">
they groan'd under, in the Times of King <HI>Charles</HI> II. and King <HI>James</HI> II. and the fal&s;e Money and Cop|per-Money impos'd in both the&s;e Reigns; parti|cularly the la&s;t, when little more than a Copper <HI>Halfpenny</HI> was made current for <HI>Half a Crown;</HI> but this (however hand&s;omely indeed expre&s;s'd) I omit for want of Room.</P>
<P>He likewi&s;e enlarg'd upon the Conduct and Fidelity of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Mini&s;ters of State, in the &s;everal In&s;pections, References, and Reports from one to another, in the ordinary Forms of pa&s;|&s;ing this <HI>Patent;</HI> how it had all the mature Con|deration, and Con&s;ultation, as well before the <HI>Privy-Council,</HI> as the <HI>Trea&s;ury,</HI> the <HI>Attorney-Gene|ral,</HI> and the <HI>Lord-Chancellor,</HI> thro' all who&s;e Hands it &s;everally pa&s;s'd; in order that nothing unju&s;t, illegal, or arbitrary, or hard, and &s;evere to the People of <HI>Ireland,</HI> &s;hou'd pa&s;s, or be al|low'd in it: Particularly he &s;poke [with the ut|mo&s;t Regard] of Mr. <HI>Wa&mdash;le,</HI> who, <HI>he &s;aid,</HI> fully under&s;tood the Nature of the Thing, and he was not to be impos'd upon by any-body, in &s;uffering &s;uch a <HI>Grant</HI> to pa&s;s in the King his Ma&s;ter's Name, without &s;o many Precautions and Provi&s;ions, as wou'd for ever make it im|po&s;&s;ible for the wor&s;t Enemy the King had, to lay any ju&s;t Reproach, either upon the Nature of the <HI>Grant,</HI> or the Manner of granting it: <HI>And here he told me,</HI> That be&s;ides the Care taken to li|mit the <HI>Patentee</HI> [as above] from any Mi&s;appli|cation of the <HI>Patent,</HI> to the Injury or Burden of the Subject, due Care was al&s;o taken to appoint &s;uch a <HI>Checque</HI> and <HI>Comptrole</HI> over the <HI>Patentee,</HI> as that it &s;hou'd not be in his Power to make
<PB N="22" REF="21">
any Excur&s;ions, beyond the Bounds of the &s;aid Powers granted; and to fini&s;h all, the <HI>Comptoller</HI> [thus appointed] was to make report, from time to time, to the <HI>Lords of the Trea&s;ury,</HI> of all that &s;hould be done in Pur&s;uance of the <HI>Patent:</HI> This, <HI>he &s;aid,</HI> was particularly owing to the Conduct of Mr. <HI>Wa &mdash;le;</HI> of whom he &s;aid a great|deal, and greatly to his Advantage, which I have not Room to bring in here.</P>
<P>I confe&s;s, I was &s;urpriz'd to hear all this from a Stranger, who had liv'd thus remote; and was extreamly glad, to find his Maje&s;ty, and his Mini&s;ters of State, &s;o well treated; and that the King e&s;pecially, who&s;e Actions [I was before a&s;&s;ur'd] are always guided with the mo&s;t exqui|&s;ite Care, and Concern, for the Good of his Sub|jects, in all his Dominions; I &s;ay, I was ex|treamly glad, to find his Maje&s;ty had &s;o much Ju&s;tice done him, and that his whole Admini&s;tra|tion was &s;o effectually vindicated by a plain [but well-meaning] Man, &s;o remote from the Place where the&s;e Things were done.</P>
<P>But I confe&s;s, when he told me, that by this <HI>Grant</HI> the People of <HI>Ireland</HI> were left &s;o entirely free in this whole Affair, that they might take the &s;aid Copper-Money, or refu&s;e it, as they pleas'd; that not the meane&s;t Per&s;on in the Kingdom was to be impos'd upon, or oblig'd to accept them in Payment, or deliver their Goods for them; I &s;ay, when I heard this, and that he pull'd out a Copy of the <HI>Grant,</HI> and &s;hew'd it me in &s;o many Words, I was, from that Mo|ment, entirely at a lo&s;s, to find which Way the
<PB N="23" REF="22">
Injury to the People of <HI>Ireland</HI> cou'd be made out, or the Damage to their Trade be made rational; but then I pull'd out &s;ome Printed Papers, which I had met with in the Town, where this Matter was very much canvas'd, as particularly <HI>Mi&s;t's Journal, the Whitehall Evening-Post, Boyer's</HI> &s;canda|lous <HI>Political State,</HI> and &s;uch like Pamphlets; and began to enter into &s;ome Di&s;cour&s;e about them.</P>
<P>But he took me &s;hort with a Que&s;tion: Do'&s;t <HI>thou</HI> know, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> what our People in <HI>Ireland</HI> &s;ay of tho&s;e Libels? No, <HI>&s;ays I;</HI> Why they &s;ay, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> that Friend <HI>William Wood</HI> the <HI>Pa|tentee,</HI> had hir'd &s;ome &s;ubtle Fellow to write a Libel, and publi&s;h it in <HI>Mi&s;t's Journal, &amp;c.</HI> which was to be perform'd weakly and &s;candalou&s;ly, to form Cavils again&s;t the Patent, that he might have the Advantage of confuting and expo&s;ing them; as tho&s;e who write Dialogues make the Enquirer propo&s;e none but weak Que|&s;tions, that they may be an&s;wer'd to the Ad|vantage of the Party he writes for.</P>
<P><HI>I told him,</HI> that was begging the Que&s;tion, and alledging nothing, e&s;pecially as to the Objections about the Value, and the Injury done the People: Nay, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> I do not tell <HI>thee</HI> that 'tis &s;o, but that indeed it is done very weakly and folli&s;h|ly, that cannot be denied.</P>
<P>But one thing, <HI>he &s;aid,</HI> cou'd not be omitted as to the&s;e Libels; <HI>namely,</HI> How much con|cern'd the Party who oppos'd this Patent, were, to make their Clamours popular; and that you in <HI>England &s;aid he,</HI> &s;hou'd hear one &s;ide of
<PB N="24" REF="23">
the Que&s;tion, where you cou'd not &s;o readily know what the Sentiments of the People in <HI>Ire|land</HI> were, which is the other &s;ide of it: <HI>Then he ob&s;erv'd,</HI> how unju&s;t and unfair the Way of Arguing was; that &s;eeing the &s;mall Copper-Money is chiefly appointed for the U&s;e of the Common People, and that in the Retail Trade, tho&s;e People are indeed, be&s;t able to judge whether they had Need of them, and whether they were any Con|venience to them or no; yet <HI>in Truth, &s;ays he,</HI> they have not been enquir'd of in this Mat|ter.</P>
<P>Here he made another Digre&s;&s;ion upon the Want they had been in for many Years, of &s;uch Species of Money; how Retailers, for want of &s;mall Money, were oblig'd to keep long Scores, and give long Credit to their Cu&s;tomers, for little things, till they were frequently forgot, or more frequently lo&s;t; that tho&s;e who wou'd not keep &s;uch Scores, and give &s;uch Credit, were oblig'd to &s;it &s;till, and not &s;ell their Goods; &s;o that Trade was cramp'd, and made both difficult and hazardous: That all the Help they had again&s;t this, was from &s;everal &s;orts of &s;mall Money, &s;uch as <HI>Rapps, French Threepences, Rials,</HI> and &s;uch like; which, in the fir&s;t Place, <HI>he &s;aid,</HI> did not &s;upply the want of <HI>Farthings</HI> and <HI>Halfpence,</HI> their Quan|tity being &s;mall: And, 2. They were brought into <HI>Ireland</HI> much more to the Lo&s;s of the Publick, than the Copper-Money now complain'd of.</P>
<P>For Brevity &s;ake, I omit a great deal of what he offer'd on that Account, wherein I thought it was &s;o evidence that <HI>Ireland</HI> was in great Want
<PB N="25" REF="24">
of a Copper Coinage, that I wonder'd much at what I had heard here in <HI>England</HI> upon that Sub|ject: But to go on, I then ask'd him what he &s;aid to all the Calculations which I &s;hew'd him in our printed Papers, of the great Lo&s;s to the Publick, which there wou'd nece&s;&s;arily be in this Money at la&s;t, the exorbitant Gain of the <HI>Paten|tee,</HI> and the Inju&s;tice of both.</P>
<P><HI>He told me,</HI> It was evident to any that wou'd impartially look into that Matter, that tho&s;e Calculations were all fal&s;e and unju&s;t; and that they were made, by Per&s;ons who either mi&s;took thro' Ignorance, or from a wor&s;e Principle; and that he wou'd undertake to convince me, that not one of them was ju&s;tly drawn up; <HI>he added,</HI> that he cou'd ea&s;ily confute them all; nay, <HI>added he,</HI> even <HI>Friend Wood</HI> him&s;elf, or tho&s;e who have written in his Defence, have not given the due Weight to his own Cau&s;e; but much more is to be &s;aid on that Occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>I wou'd have enter'd, one by one, into the ge|neral Valuations on the one &s;ide, and on the o|ther, which I &s;hew'd him in the printed Papers; but <HI>he &s;aid,</HI> it needed not; that he had &s;een them all, and that he wou'd give me a few Ex|planations, which if I thought fit to be&s;tow my Thoughts upon, wou'd enable me to give full An&s;wers to them all, wherever I met with them.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t, he &s;aid,</HI> No Man ought to &s;uppo&s;e, that a Coinage of <HI>Farthings</HI> and <HI>Halfpence</HI> cou'd be &s;et-up, wherein the Coin &s;hou'd bear the full Weight and Value of the Principles from which
<PB N="26" REF="25">
it was form'd; or that there &s;hou'd not be an Al|lowance for the preparing the Metal, and the Incidents attending it; for the Coinage it&s;elf, and the Uten&s;ils, Places of Workman&s;hip, Officers, and Per&s;ons employ'd, <HI>that is to &s;ay,</HI> Labour, <HI>and the like;</HI> the general Coinage <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> is not done without it.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly, he &s;aid,</HI> No Man ought to &s;uppo&s;e, that the Grant was given to any Per&s;on for &s;uch an Undertaking, attended with &s;o much Ri&s;que, Application and Expence, and where &s;o great a Stock al&s;o was requir'd, and that he, <HI>the Undertaker,</HI> &s;hou'd not have a rea&s;onable Gain from it, for the Encouragement of the Undertaking.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly, he &s;aid,</HI> if the&s;e Allowances for the Expences, and Incidents in preparing and coining this Money, did not exceed the like Allowances, which have u&s;ually been made in the like Ca&s;es, [except where the different Circum&s;tance of the Country made it rea&s;onable] then the <HI>Patentee</HI> has not put any-thing upon the World, which is not ju&s;tifiable by the Cu&s;tom and U&s;age of <HI>Patentees,</HI> in like Ca&s;es, and al&s;o by the Privileges and Grants of this particular <HI>Patent.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e three Con&s;iderations, <HI>he &s;aid,</HI> wou'd effectually remove all ju&s;t Complaints from the Per&s;on, or Conduct, of the <HI>Patentee;</HI> and as to the Value of his <HI>Farthings</HI> and <HI>Hal&s;pence,</HI> and as to the Advantage or Di&s;advantage to Trade, and to the Publick by them, he wou'd &s;peak to that Part by it&s;elf.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="26">
As to the Value of the Copper, the Expence of Coinage, and Profit of the <HI>Patentee,</HI> he &s;tated them together thus:</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> he objected, that there was &s;ome De|bate about the current Value of Copper in <HI>Ire|land,</HI> which &s;ome wou'd have be call'd 1 <HI>s. per</HI> Pound, others 1 <HI>s.</HI> 2 <HI>d. per</HI> Pound; but as he &s;aid, he had been a Merchant, and had imported Copper him&s;elf, as well from <HI>Sweden</HI> as from <HI>England,</HI> and likewi&s;e from <HI>Barbary,</HI> he cou'd not afford to &s;ell the Copper in Bulk, under 14 <HI>d.</HI> but often &s;old it for 15 <HI>d. per</HI> Pound; that if Mr. <HI>Wood,</HI> by buying it in <HI>England,</HI> did get it cheaper, that was not the Que&s;tion here at-all; but we ought to &s;uppo&s;e it at 1 <HI>s.</HI> 2 <HI>d. per</HI> Pound.</P>
<P>Now, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> I am not to enquire what the Profit to the <HI>Patentee</HI> immediately is, upon this Pound of Copper, for that is not the Que&s;tion; but what it is more than the Profit of the like Coinage in <HI>England,</HI> and then &s;ee what Rea&s;ons can be given for the Difference; and by this it will appear whether the <HI>Patentee</HI> is chargable with Exorbitance, or not.</P>
<P>In <HI>England, &s;ays he,</HI> a Pound of Copper makes 45 <HI>Hal&s;pence,</HI> &s;ometimes 46; in <HI>Ireland,</HI> by this new Patent, we have 60; &s;o that Friend <HI>Wood</HI> &s;ays, he makes 7 <HI>d. halfpenny</HI> in a Pound of <HI>Copper</HI> more of his Coinage than is made in <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="27">
I was &s;urpriz'd at his Way of reckoning, for I was going to draw the Account out in Co|lumns, as the printed Papers have done; but he took me &s;hort; No, no, <HI>he &s;aid,</HI> their Bu&s;ine&s;s was not to enquire what Mr. <HI>Wood</HI> got by the Coinage, but what he got more than was gotten by the &s;ame Works in <HI>England;</HI> for if they in <HI>Ireland</HI> had but Neighbours Fare, it was what cou'd not be objected again&s;t: Therefore, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> I have nothing to do with the Expence of preparing the Metal, or of the Coinage, the Al|lowances on one hand or other; here is 7 <HI>d. halfpenny per</HI> Pound Difference, let us &s;ee how Friend <HI>Wood</HI> accounts for that, and what he has to &s;ay why he &s;hou'd make <HI>Ireland</HI> pay 7 <HI>d. half|penny per</HI> Pound more than <HI>England</HI> pays for the &s;ame Species.</P>
<P>Well, <HI>&s;aid I,</HI> this is a &s;hort Way of coming at the Que&s;tion, indeed; pray go on.</P>
<P>Why fir&s;t, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> the Copper in <HI>Ireland</HI> is granted to be of the Value of 1 <HI>s.</HI> 2 <HI>d. per</HI> Pound, which is 2 <HI>d.</HI> more than in <HI>England;</HI> &s;o there is 2 <HI>d.</HI> of the 7 <HI>d. halfpenny;</HI> then there is the Difference of Exchange upon his Money, which at 10 <HI>per Cent.</HI> is 3 <HI>d.</HI> in the Half-Crown more; but becau&s;e a very critical Oppo&s;er may in&s;i&s;t, that the&s;e two Articles relating only to the Difference of Value between <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Ireland,</HI> are there|fore in &s;ome re&s;pect the &s;ame, I will &s;et by the Difference of the Price of Copper in this part of the Di&s;cour&s;e, and only take the bare Ex|change of Money, which the <HI>Patentee</HI> mu&s;t &s;ink,
<PB N="29" REF="28">
to bring back his Money to <HI>England,</HI> in order to go to Market for more Copper.</P>
<P>This Rate of Exchange being one time with another 10 <HI>per Cent.</HI> is 2 <HI>s. per l.</HI> which is ju&s;t 3 <HI>d.</HI> on the Pound of Copper.</P>
<P>Then, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> there is the Charge of &s;hip|ping the Coin, &s;uppo&s;e at <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> or <HI>London,</HI> when fini&s;h'd; the Freight to <HI>Ireland;</HI> the Landing there; the Ri&s;que of the Sea; the Charge on|&s;hore, <HI>&s;uch as</HI> Warehou&s;e-room, Commi&s;&s;ion to the Per&s;ons di&s;po&s;ing of it, and Commi&s;&s;ion a|gain for remitting back the Effects: If all this is not to be computed at 10 <HI>per Cent.</HI> more, I mu&s;t &s;ee &s;ome Rea&s;ons given to the contrary, which I do not &s;ee yet, before I allow it.</P>
<P>He then went on to innumerate &s;everal other Particulars, which added to Mr. <HI>Wood</HI>'s Charge, as well before, as after the Coinage here, which the Coinage at the <HI>Tower</HI> is not loaded with; Particularly, that all Mr. <HI>Wood</HI>'s Servants, and Workmen, Engines, Tools, Buildings, and Con|veniences, are hir'd on purpo&s;e, and maintain'd &s;olely for this one Work; and con&s;equently his Charge of Servants and Workmen is greater, than at the <HI>Tower,</HI> where all things are prepar'd for other Branches of the Coinage, as well as that of the Copper-Money, and where the Servants are employ'd in common upon the one as well as the other, and con&s;equently the Charge is not equal: But all this, <HI>he &s;aid,</HI> he only mention'd, for that be&s;ides this, the other two Articles had brought his Calculation beyond what his Argu|ment
<PB N="30" REF="29">
call'd for; and it appear'd, that <HI>Ireland</HI> had their <HI>Farthings</HI> of Mr. <HI>Wood</HI> cheaper, the Circum|&s;tances of their Situation con&s;ider'd, one <HI>Half|penny</HI> in a Pound-weight, than <HI>England</HI> receiv'd theirs from the <HI>Tower.</HI></P>
<P>With this Addition al&s;o, That if the <HI>Farthings</HI> and <HI>Halfpence,</HI> both in <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Ireland,</HI> were all to be melted down, and reduc'd into meer Copper-Metal, the &s;aid Copper-wou'd &s;ell for 2 <HI>d. per</HI> Pound weight more than the reduc'd Copper in <HI>England</HI> wou'd &s;ell for; &s;o that <HI>Ireland</HI> wou'd be le&s;s a Lo&s;er than <HI>England,</HI> by 1 <HI>s.</HI> 4 <HI>d. per l.</HI> Sterling; which is 6 <HI>l.</HI> 13. 4 <HI>per Cent.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I told him,</HI> I cou'd not deny but his Calculation was ju&s;t &s;o far.</P>
<P>Well then, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> I have gain'd that Point, and <HI>thou</HI> mu&s;t allow, that Friend <HI>Wood</HI> does not get more by the <HI>Farthings</HI> and <HI>Halfpence</HI> in <HI>Ire|land,</HI> than the Government gains, (if it be gain'd) by the like Species coin'd at the <HI>Tower.</HI></P>
<P>Likewi&s;e, <HI>&s;aid he, thou</HI> can'&s;t not but &s;ee, that the <HI>Government</HI> of <HI>England</HI> has acted not only with a due Regard to Ju&s;tice, but with a prudent Re|gard to the Subjects of <HI>Ireland;</HI> not to lay any Bur|then upon them, but what the Nature of the thing, and the Circum&s;tances of the Kingdom made nece&s;&s;ary; and that they are &s;o far from having rea&s;on to complain of being oppre&s;s'd, or impos'd arbitrarily upon, and having harder Terms than <HI>England,</HI> that on the contrary, they have rather the Advantage, than the Di&s;advan|tage,

of <HI>England,</HI> in this Grant, and that in every Part of it.</P>
<P>But where then, <HI>&s;aid I,</HI> is Mr. <HI>Wood</HI>'s Profit?</P>
<P><HI>I tell thee,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>&s;peaking a little warm,</HI> That's nothing to me, or to <HI>thee,</HI> as to the Matter in debate: If there is a Profit in the Coinage in the <HI>Tower,</HI> &s;o there may be to him in his Coin|age at <HI>Bri&s;tol;</HI> and yet even in that, as I have told <HI>thee</HI> already, his Profit mu&s;t be much le&s;s than theirs at the <HI>Tower,</HI> many Ways; but that, <HI>he &s;aid,</HI> was one of the pre&s;ent Que&s;tions which he challeng'd me to an&s;wer, if I cou'd, <HI>namely,</HI> Whether Mr. <HI>Wood,</HI> Friend <HI>Wood he call'd him,</HI> had made any Advantage, by virtue of this Grant, more than was made of the like Coin|age in <HI>England?</HI> And whether <HI>Ireland</HI> had not their <HI>Farthings</HI> and <HI>Halfpence</HI> as cheap, <HI>their own Circum&s;tances only excepted,</HI> as <HI>England</HI> had theirs? Which indeed, I cou'd not deny.</P>
<P>But I have not done with <HI>thee</HI> yet, <HI>&s;ays my</HI> QUAKER; for I &s;hall now undertake to tell <HI>thee,</HI> and perhaps prove it as plainly as I have done the other:</P>
<P N="1">1. That as the <HI>Patentee</HI> really does, and indeed mu&s;t, di&s;po&s;e of the&s;e <HI>Farthings</HI> and <HI>Half|pence,</HI> they are in effect, very little Lo&s;s to <HI>Ireland;</HI> no, tho' they were to be reduc'd immediately to their fir&s;t Principles, and &s;old in Bulk as meer Copper.</P>
<P N="2">2. That as he may di&s;po&s;e of them, and as I, <HI>&s;ays the</HI> QUAKER, am told, he has of|fer'd to di&s;po&s;e of them, they will be &s;o far
<PB N="32" REF="31">
from being any Lo&s;s to the publick Stock of the Kingdom, that if <HI>Ireland</HI> will do Ju|&s;tice to the <HI>Patentee</HI> and his A&s;&s;igns, they &s;hall after a certain Period of Years, call them all in at Demand, and he &s;hall pay for them the full Value they were at fir&s;t i&s;&s;u'd out at, and that in the current Money of <HI>Ireland.</HI></P>
<P>I look'd a little &s;urpriz'd at him, and de&s;ir'd to know how this cou'd be made out? <HI>He told me,</HI> it wou'd be too long to enter upon at that time, unle&s;s I had a great-deal more Patience than he thought I had; however, as he found me eager to be inform'd, and that, <HI>he &s;aid,</HI> I might &s;et it in a clear Light to others, <HI>he told me,</HI> he wou'd enter a little upon the Fir&s;t, and if we had not Time for the re&s;t, it &s;hou'd be adjourn'd to our next Lei&s;ure.</P>
<P>He began then with the Fir&s;t, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>He bid me ob&s;erve, that as <HI>Farthings</HI> and <HI>Halfpence</HI> were the lowe&s;t Species of Coin, &s;o they were di&s;pos'd of, <HI>generally &s;peaking,</HI> among the meane&s;t &s;ort of the trading People; and in Con&s;equence of this, <HI>he &s;aid,</HI> they were ordina|rily exchang'd for the meane&s;t Species of Mo|ney; and that particularly, for <HI>French Threepen|ces</HI> and <HI>Groats,</HI> quarters of <HI>Livres, and the like,</HI> and at the be&s;t, for <HI>Rials</HI> or <HI>Cobbs</HI> by weight, or <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Money by tale.</P>
<P>Of the la&s;t we cou'd not &s;uppo&s;e, <HI>he &s;aid,</HI> much was receiv'd; but of the former, the greate&s;t Part; it ought then to be enquir'd, <HI>he</HI>

upon the <HI>Scots Bodles,</HI> and <HI>Baubees,</HI> both which went current in <HI>&V;l&s;ter,</HI> and were, tho' <HI>Copper,</HI> con&s;iderably lighter, and le&s;s worth, than the <HI>New Farthings</HI> and <HI>Halfpence</HI> coin'd by Friend <HI>William Wood,</HI> as he call'd him.</P>
<P>I cou'd not deny the Force of this Argu|ment, nor cou'd I avoid the Con&s;equence of it; which he had laid down thus:</P>
<P>If then, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> this <HI>New Copper Coin</HI> be pur|chas'd with another <HI>Coin</HI> equally deficient, which yet is current in the &s;ame Kingdom of <HI>Ireland;</HI> then <HI>Ireland</HI> can lo&s;e nothing by the <HI>Farthings</HI> and <HI>Halfpence;</HI> becau&s;e 'tis evident, they wou'd only &s;upply the Place of Foreign Coins, and prevent the Encrea&s;e, which are already receiv'd at a like Lo&s;s, and which if the <HI>Copper Money</HI> did not come in, wou'd daily encrea&s;e, the Want of &s;mall Mo|ney appearing to grow greater and greater in <HI>Ireland.</HI></P>
<P>Having gone through this Part of his Argu|ment, which he enlarg'd much more upon, than I have room here to give an Account of, I pre&s;s'd him to enter upon his Second Article, which, <HI>he &s;aid,</HI> was &s;o &s;ignificant, and which I &s;eem'd to wonder &s;o much at; and I promis'd him my Attention, being, <HI>as indeed I was,</HI> impatient to hear his Explanation of what I thought was &s;o my&s;terious: So he repeated the whole Article; for I am not afraid <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> or doubtful that I &s;hall not make it out to <HI>thy</HI> Satisfaction: The Article is as follows, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="35">
Fir&s;t, <HI>he &s;aid,</HI> he laid it as a Foundation, that <HI>Friend Wood, &s;o he call'd the Patentee,</HI> &s;hou'd &s;ell his <HI>Farthings</HI> and <HI>Halfpence</HI> for Manufactures ei|ther of Wool or Flax, as he told me he had offer'd to do for &s;ome Part of them.</P>
<P><HI>I reply'd,</HI> I knew that Mr. <HI>Wood</HI> intended to do &s;o, and that if he did not immediately exchange the the <HI>Farthings</HI> and <HI>Halfpence</HI> for Linnen and Wool|len Manufactures, he was &s;uch a Friend to the Commerce of <HI>Ireland,</HI> and had re&s;olv'd to encou|rage it &s;o much, that he re&s;olv'd to ve&s;t a great Part of the Species he receiv'd for them in tho&s;e Goods, and to Ship the &s;ame for the <HI>We&s;t-Indies.</HI></P>
<P>Very well, <HI>he &s;aid;</HI> then he undertook to prove that for all tho&s;e <HI>Farthings</HI> and <HI>Halfpence</HI> which &s;hould be &s;o ve&s;ted in Woollen or Linnen Manu|factures of <HI>Ireland,</HI> to be carry'd out of the King|dom, whether to <HI>England,</HI> or the <HI>We&s;t-Indies, Ireland</HI> &s;hou'd gain con&s;iderably, tho' the &s;aid <HI>Farthings</HI> and <HI>Halfpence</HI> were immediately melted again, and reduc'd into <HI>Copper</HI> Metal.</P>
<P>I li&s;ten'd earne&s;tly to this Di&s;cour&s;e, and waited the Demon&s;tration; which he began thus:</P>
<P>Previous, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> to the Computations and Schemes that may be nece&s;&s;ary to explain this Article, <HI>thou</HI> mu&s;t grant me one ju&s;t Di&s;tinction; <HI>namely,</HI> That we are not now &s;peaking of the Profit or Lo&s;s accruing to this or that private Per&s;on in <HI>Ireland,</HI> in any Part of what may be &s;poken of about
<PB N="37" REF="36">
the <HI>Farthings</HI> and <HI>Halfpence,</HI> but of the Pro|fit or Lo&s;s to the publick Stock of <HI>Ireland</HI> as a Nation.</P>
<P><HI>For Example,</HI> Fir&s;t, <HI>he &s;aid,</HI> the Value of any Product form'd by the Indu&s;try of the Peo|ple, was of no real Advantage to, and did not encrea&s;e the publick Stock of the Coun|try, if that Product was not &s;ent away, and exported out of the Kingdom; for as to what was con&s;um'd at-home, whatever was gain'd by the &s;everal Artificers and Manu|facturers thro' who&s;e Hands it pa&s;s'd, was lo&s;t again in his Hands who was the la&s;t Con&s;umer, and &s;o the general Stock re|main'd the &s;ame.</P>
<P N="2">2. Of tho&s;e Manufactures which are export|ed, no Part can be e&s;teem'd a Diminution of the publick Stock, but the fir&s;t Princi|ples of the Manufacture, all the re&s;t is Gain to the Stock; and con&s;equently what|ever is return'd, or paid for it, is clear Pro|fit to the publick Stock of the Country.</P>
<P>Now, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> for Example, If a Pound of Wool, co&s;ting 3 <HI>d.</HI> by various Improvements, arrives to the Value of 5 <HI>s.</HI> in Manufactures (as it is ma|fe&s;t in &s;ome Manufactures, it will double that Value,) and if then <HI>thy Friend Wood</HI> gives two Pound of <HI>Copper Halfpence,</HI> value 5 <HI>s.</HI> for this Pound of Wool manufactur'd, tho' this two Pound of <HI>Halfpence</HI> be immediately melted, and reduc'd into <HI>Copper</HI> Metal, and &s;old for 14 <HI>d. per</HI> Pound, which is 2 <HI>s.</HI> 4 <HI>d.</HI> the publick Stock of the Kingdom of <HI>Ireland</HI> gains two Shillings and one Penny by the Exchange.</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="37">
I confe&s;s I was confounded at this Computa|tion, and at fir&s;t did not readily apprehend it, wherefore <HI>I ask'd him,</HI> what came of the almo&s;t numberle&s;s Families of Handicrafts, Labourers, and Manufacturers employ'd in bringing the Ma|nufacture &s;o wrought from the Fleece to the Merchandize.</P>
<P>Become of them? <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> they are all paid by one another; what they earn, they &s;pend; it circulates from one to another; they gain by Work, the eat, and lo&s;e it again, and &s;till 'tis within our&s;elves; the publick Stock neither en|crea&s;es or decrea&s;es by that; but the <HI>Copper</HI> which <HI>thy</HI> Friend brings in, leave 2 <HI>s.</HI> 1 <HI>d.</HI> of &s;olid un|con&s;umable Metal in Specie in the Kingdom, more than the 3 <HI>d.</HI> which it carried away.</P>
<P>This 2 <HI>s.</HI> 1 <HI>d.</HI> is a real Value, it will go to <HI>Scotland,</HI> or <HI>England,</HI> or <HI>Portugal,</HI> or any-where, and exchange it&s;elf into Gold or Silver, if you plea&s;e, and come home as valuable as it went out, and will never dimini&s;h, unle&s;s lo&s;t by &s;ome &s;ub&s;equent Conduct, to which this has no relation.</P>
<P>I had not one Word to &s;ay again&s;t this, nor can I &s;ince, tho' I have propos'd it to &s;everal in the very &s;ame terms which the QUAKER &s;ta|ted it to me; <HI>I &s;ay,</HI> I cannot meet with one &s;ub|&s;tantial Objection again&s;t it, &s;o I leave it for any one to confute, who think they can confute it.</P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="38">
But now FRIEND, <HI>&s;ays my</HI> QUAKER, I have not done with <HI>thee</HI> yet; my next Que&s;tion is, If the Profit to the publick Stock be thus great, under the unnece&s;&s;ary Suppo&s;ition of a Reduction of the <HI>Copper Coin</HI> to its meer fir&s;t Prin|ciples, what an immen&s;e Gain to the publick Stock of <HI>Ireland</HI> mu&s;t it be, if this Coin re|mains current; for tho' it is true, &s;imply con&s;i|der'd, that it is of no more Value than the 2 <HI>s.</HI> 1 <HI>d.</HI> to which it may be reduc'd, yet it is really a Loan to the Kingdom of <HI>Ireland</HI> of 2 <HI>s.</HI> 11 <HI>d.</HI> more, in every 5 <HI>s.</HI> current Ca&s;h, which Loan it &s;upplies the Nation with, for the Convenience of its Commerce, without any Intere&s;t; and if there &s;hou'd be the Value of 200,000 <HI>l.</HI> in Far|things thus made current for any Number of Years, the Advantage of this in Trade is &s;carce to be computed, &s;eeing it is capable (always &s;ug|ge&s;ting it to be laid out in Manufactures) of keeping the Poor of the whole Kingdom em|ploy'd, and con&s;uming the Product in a foreign Nation.</P>
<P>And this is the Foundation, <HI>added he,</HI> on which, <HI>I &s;aid before, and &s;ay it now,</HI> let <HI>Ireland</HI> pay Intere&s;t for this Loan, to the <HI>Patentee,</HI> but at 3 <HI>per Cent.</HI> the <HI>Patentee</HI> may oblige him&s;elf, his Executors, Ad|mini&s;trators, and A&s;&s;igns, at any time after thir|ty Years, to call the&s;e <HI>Farthings</HI> and <HI>Halfpence</HI> all in, and pay for them at the full Rate as <HI>Far|things</HI> and <HI>Halfpence;</HI> or let them be melted down in <HI>Ireland,</HI> and pay the Difference.</P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="39">
I li&s;ten'd to this Part too, with Attention, tho' it &s;eem'd to be but a Speculation; but upon ex|amining it, I cou'd not deny the Fact, or find a|ny Falacy in the rea&s;oning Part.</P>
<P>My QUAKER &s;eeing me &s;ilent, began to &s;mile at me; and now my Friend, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> what Occa&s;ion has here been for &s;uch a plentiful Show|er of Railery at King <HI>George,</HI> and his Govern|ment in <HI>England?</HI> or at the Mini&s;ters of State? or at <HI>Friend Wood?

<P>Really, <HI>&s;ays I, thou</HI> ha&s;t made it &s;o plain to me, I think they have been impos'd upon indeed; 'tis true, I thought &s;o before, but I cou'd not make it out &s;o clearly as I can now.</P>
<P>Well, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> I am glad thou art convinc'd at la&s;t; but now &s;hall I ask <HI>thee</HI> a Que&s;tion or two about what I hear &s;ince I came to <HI>Eng|land?</HI> for <HI>thou, &s;ays he,</HI> may'&s;t perhaps, know more of that Part than I do, or, <HI>at lea&s;t, thou</HI> can'&s;t, as a Piece of News, tell me whether it be true or not.</P>
<P>What are your Que&s;tions, <HI>&s;ays I?</HI></P>
<P>Why, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> one of my Que&s;tions is this: I under&s;tand it has been de&s;ir'd of our King, by &s;ome People, that he &s;hou'd i&s;&s;ue out his Pro|clamation to forbid the taking the&s;e <HI>Farthings</HI> and <HI>Halfpence</HI> in the Kingdom of <HI>Ireland.</HI></P>
<P>I interrupted him there, <HI>and told him,</HI> I be|liev'd that was his Mi&s;take, and that, as I was
<PB N="41" REF="40">
inform'd, it was only an Application or Addre&s;s to the King, to command his Officers and Re|ceivers of the Revenue, not to take them in Payment.</P>
<P>Why, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> even what <HI>thou</HI> &s;ay'&s;t, is the &s;ame thing in a le&s;&s;er Degree, but I do not mean that; but as I &s;aid to <HI>thee,</HI> I have been inform'd, that &s;ome People have endeavour'd, or re&s;olv'd to endeavour, to obtain a Proclamation to com|mand the People not to take them; or, <HI>added he,</HI> to &s;peak in <HI>thy</HI> Country Way in the like Ca&s;es, <HI>to cry them down.</HI></P>
<P>Well, <HI>&s;ays I,</HI> and what do you infer from that?</P>
<P>Why, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> I wou'd ask <HI>thee</HI> a Que&s;tion upon that Subject: Whether wou'd it not be as arbitrary and illegal to have commanded us not to have pa&s;s'd them as current, and not to take them in Payment as current Money, as it wou'd have been to have commanded them to pa&s;s cur|rent by virtue of the King's Prerogative?</P>
<P><HI>I an&s;wer'd,</HI> If the Coinage was the King's by Right, and by Prerogative, as he had granted, it cou'd not have been arbitrary either <HI>to cry them up,</HI> or <HI>cry them down;</HI> but both had been in the King's Power to do, without any Com|plaint ju&s;tly lying again&s;t it.</P>
<P><HI>He &s;aid,</HI> I did not keep to the <HI>Terms</HI> of his <HI>Que|&s;tion;</HI> he did not que&s;tion the Prerogative of the King, <HI>one way or other;</HI> it was none of his Bu&s;ine&s;s or Intention &s;o much as to meddle with it; but
<PB N="42" REF="41">
his Que&s;tion was, Whether one was not as much an Act of Tyranny, or Arbitrary Power, as the other?</P>
<P><HI>I told him,</HI> Yes, without Que&s;tion they were equally arbitrary, or equally rightful.</P>
<P>Well then, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> with what A&s;&s;urance mu&s;t tho&s;e Men act, who cou'd fir&s;t cen&s;ure the <HI>Pa|tent</HI> as an illegal Grant, and an arbitrary putting the <HI>Copper Coin</HI> upon the People, tho' it was not impos'd upon them neither, and yet cou'd de&s;ire the King to impo&s;e the Negative upon them; for it mu&s;t be, that as the <HI>Patent</HI> leaving the Peo|ple free, they had certainly a Right to refu&s;e them, as well as to take them; &s;o certainly they are &s;till free, and have a Right to take them, as well as refu&s;e them.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, <HI>he added,</HI> that he thought we went all upon a wrong Argument here in another Ca&s;e, for want of di&s;tingui&s;hing rightly of the thing; for, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> the Grant to <HI>thy</HI> Friend <HI>Wood</HI> does not exert the Prerogative of the King, as is u&s;ual in all Grants, and Patents of this Kind, and that relate to the Coin.</P>
<P><HI>Then he told me,</HI> That, <HI>as he had &s;aid before,</HI> there had been &s;everal Grants of this Kind be|fore this; and the King of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> had given the <HI>Copper</HI> Coinage to particular Per&s;ons be|fore now, by <HI>Patent,</HI> and that in <HI>England</HI> in par|ticular; nor was it ever e&s;teem'd to be arbitrary or illegal to declare them current.</P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="42">
But that in this Grant the King having with an unu&s;ual Tenderne&s;s to his People, left it in their Choice, whether to take them, or refu&s;e them, they were to be therefore di&s;tingui&s;h'd from the general Coinage of the King's Domi|nions, and were rather a Merchandize than a Coin; and if &s;o, <HI>&s;ays he, I</HI> do not &s;ee upon what Foundation tho&s;e Men cou'd proceed, who in|tended to move the King (if any did do &s;o) to <HI>cry them down by Proclamation,</HI> &s;eeing, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> eve|ry Man is free, and it is the undoubted Property of the People, if they have any Property at-all, to deal in, buy and &s;ell any Goods and Merchan|dize what&s;oever, if not prohibited, and made contraband by Law.</P>
<P>The&s;e <HI>Farthings</HI> and <HI>Halfpence</HI> then, <HI>he &s;aid,</HI> are nothing but a certain Quantity of <HI>Copper</HI> Me|tal &s;old in &s;mall Pieces, and which the King has given Leave to the Proprietor of them to &s;tamp with a certain Mark, by which they may be par|ticularly known, and the Value of them a&s;cer|tain'd; we are not bound &s;o much, <HI>added he,</HI> as to know them by their Names, but they are carried to Market as coin'd <HI>Copper</HI> Metal, and if any will buy them, as no doubt they have a Right to do, <HI>well and good;</HI> then <HI>Wm. Wood, thy</HI> Friend, who is the Proprietor, &s;ells them, as he and the People can agree; if they will not buy, he mu&s;t keep them till they will buy, or other|wi&s;e di&s;po&s;e of them as he thinks fit.</P>
<P>And ju&s;t thus, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> it is in this very Coun|try of <HI>England,</HI> for I need not carry <HI>thee</HI> out of
<PB N="44" REF="43">
<HI>thy</HI> Knowledge for an Example; and then he brought a mo&s;t clever compleat Parallel from the Block-Tin in <HI>Cornwall:</HI> The Tin in <HI>Corn|wall, he &s;aid,</HI> was as much <HI>a Coin</HI> as my Friend <HI>Wood</HI>'s <HI>Farthings</HI> and <HI>Halfpence</HI> in <HI>Ireland,</HI> and my Friend <HI>Wood</HI>'s <HI>Farthings</HI> and <HI>Halfpence</HI> as much a Merchandize as the Blocks of Tin in <HI>Cornwall;</HI> they are both, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> the Property of private Per&s;ons, yet both are &s;tamp'd with the &s;everal Marks and In&s;criptions, which are &s;e|verally appointed by the King's Authority; the Standard of both their Weight and Finene&s;s, <HI>adds he,</HI> are likewi&s;e adju&s;ted and &s;ettled by the &s;ame Authority, and the Works are equally call'd by the &s;ame Name, <HI>viz.</HI> a Coinage.</P>
<P>The Blocks of Tin are brought to the &s;everal <HI>Stanuary Towns</HI> in <HI>Cornwall</HI> appointed for the Coinage of Tin, and there by the King's Offi|cers they are e&s;&s;ay'd and coin'd; nor, <HI>adds he,</HI> do I put the Word <HI>Coin'd</HI> upon them, but 'tis call'd &s;o there upon the Spot; and when they are thus coin'd, the Goodne&s;s and Finene&s;s of the Metal being fir&s;t a&s;certain'd, and then the Blocks are current, <HI>that is,</HI> they are carried to Market, and any-body may buy them that plea&s;e.</P>
<P>Thus, <HI>he told me,</HI> it was with Mr. <HI>Wood</HI>'s Coinage; <HI>thy</HI> Friend <HI>Wood, &s;ays he,</HI> does no more, his <HI>Copper</HI> is brought to <HI>Bristol,</HI> which is his <HI>Sta|nuary Town,</HI> or Place of Coinage, there they are form'd into &s;uch Pieces as the Market calls for, and there the Metal is e&s;&s;ay'd, and the Value of it a&s;certain'd by proper Per&s;ons; then
<PB N="45" REF="44">
it is &s;tamp'd, and &s;uch Marks and In&s;criptions made upon them as is directed by the King's Authority; <HI>and what then?</HI> Why then 'tis a cur|rent Merchandize, and 'tis carry'd to <HI>Ireland</HI> to Market, where any-body may buy them that plea&s;e.</P>
<P>This Con&s;ideration, <HI>he &s;aid,</HI> gave the People a Right to buy them, and as <HI>Copper,</HI> in whatever Shape, was not prohibited in <HI>Ireland,</HI> none cou'd be forbid admitting them to be imported, unle&s;s they were &s;o prohibited by Law, or be forbid|den to buy them and &s;ell them, when they were imported, and that when, and as often, and at what Price or Value the Buyer and Seller cou'd agree for.</P>
<P>And by the &s;ame Rule, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> the&s;e, or any other Goods of the like Nature, may be made current by the common Con&s;ent of the People in any other Part of the King's Dominions; and here he enter'd into a very fine and ingenious Di&s;cour&s;e upon the great Ea&s;e with which a coin'd Merchandize might (the King con&s;ent|ing) be made current in all the di&s;tant Parts of the King's Dominions, with due Calculations and Allowances for the intrin&s;ick Value of the Materials, and for the Proportions to the Rates of Exchange, or the Lo&s;s and Gain in the inter|cour&s;e of Commerce between <HI>England</HI> and all the &s;aid di&s;tant Places re&s;pectively.</P>
<P>But when I was big with Expectations for his en|larging on &s;o <HI>agreeable</HI> and &s;o <HI>improving</HI> a <HI>Subject,</HI> he turn'd it back again to <HI>Ireland,</HI> and the Subject we
<PB N="46" REF="45">
were upon before, in this plea&s;ant and u&s;ual man|ner; I am not going, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> to carry <HI>thee</HI> off of <HI>thy</HI> Argument, to follow my Notions, which per|haps are out of <HI>thy</HI> Way, I bring it back to the Ca&s;e in hand, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> and to the Proportions in this Coinage of <HI>thy</HI> Friend <HI>Wood</HI> in <HI>Ireland,</HI> and it wou'd not be ami&s;s, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> to enlarge a little upon the Argument, how well the Value is pro|portion'd and calculated to the Rate of Ex|change, either to <HI>England,</HI> or between <HI>Ireland</HI> and any other Country in <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>It may not, <HI>&s;aid I,</HI> be &s;o much out of my Way as you imagine, to talk of proportioning a petty Coinage for other Places be&s;ides <HI>Ireland;</HI> on the contrary, <HI>&s;aid I,</HI> I &s;hall be very glad to hear you talk on that Subject too, becau&s;e I fancy you have &s;pent &s;ome Thoughts that Way.</P>
<P>Yes, <HI>he &s;aid,</HI> he had, but it was too con&s;ide|rable a Subject to enter into at pre&s;ent, and he wou'd give me an Hour or two by it&s;elf on that Part, when I wou'd; but <HI>he &s;aid,</HI> he cou'd not give up this Ca&s;e of the <HI>Copper</HI> Money in <HI>Ireland,</HI> without ob&s;erving one thing more, <HI>viz.</HI> that the Proportions between the current and the intrin|&s;ick Value were &s;o well calculated and adju&s;ted, that notwith&s;tanding all that had been objected in Publick, and in Private, yet there was a nearer Proportion in the <HI>Copper</HI> Money, than in any o|ther Foreign Species of Money that were current at that time in the Kingdom; I mean a Propor|tion, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> to the Value of Exchanges from other Countries; and that a Foreign Bill of Ex|change made payable at <HI>Dublin,</HI> wou'd much
<PB N="47" REF="46">
better be Paid in <HI>Copper Farthings,</HI> than in <HI>French</HI> or <HI>Dutch,</HI> or any other Money, except only in <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Guineas; and, <HI>he added,</HI> that there was a greater Weight of Argument lay upon this Part, than I was yet aware of; but this al&s;o we agreed to adjourn.</P>
<P><HI>He then concluded with telling me,</HI> He hop'd he might &s;ay, that the King and the Mini&s;ters of State in <HI>England</HI> know the State of Affairs in <HI>Ireland</HI> &s;o well, and were &s;o heartily concern'd for the publick Good of the Kingdom, that he was in great Hopes they &s;hou'd not be depriv'd of the Advantage of this &s;mall Coinage, which, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> if we &s;hou'd, it wou'd be an infinite Di&s;|advantage to our Commerce.</P>
<P>We had a great-deal of Di&s;cour&s;e more of this Kind, but I have not room to give any farther Account of it at this Time.</P>
