<P>ROYAL-RELIGION! &s;ays the Fir&s;t Man that looks on the Book, what d'ye mean by that? Did ever Man write a Book on &s;o Empty a Sub|ject? This is like my Lord <HI>Roche&s;ter</HI>'s Poem up|on Nothing, or the Niceties of Entity and Non-Entity. Royal-Religion! a Demon&s;tration of a <HI>Vacuum</HI> in Nature, a <HI>Salamander</HI> in the Fire, <HI>Lawyers</HI> Hone&s;ty, <HI>Jews</HI> Charity, <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Humanity, a <HI>Brute</HI>'s Ab&s;tinence, a <HI>Prie&s;t</HI>'s Conti|nence, or a <HI>Whore</HI>'s Maidenhead.</P>
<P>Well Gentlemen, ha' Patience, while we make a little &s;earch after this Novelty: And &s;ince the Religion of Prin|ces is under a little Scandal, bear with us a while, and we'll make Enquiry about it, perhaps we may find &s;ome Religion among Crown'd Heads; where we mi&s;s it, we'll let you know; and if we find it, we'll not fail to give you no|tice.</P>
<P>But why &s;hould any Man bu&s;ie him&s;elf to no purpo&s;e? &s;ays another Learned Objector. Name me one King that ever had any Religion in him, I'll name you forty that never troubl'd their Heads about God or Devil; never liv'd as if there was either, or thought it worth while to enquire whether there was or no.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="3">
It may be &s;o, Gentlemen; but don't di&s;courage a body in the Enquiry. Neither is that an Argument; for, if there be one Good Man in forty Kings, there's as many in proportion as there is of any Cla&s;s of Men in the World; be&s;ides, there is not above one King to Five Millions of Subjects all over <HI>Europe,</HI> one with another, and if there be one Religious King in an Age, 'tis above a Proportion in the account of Good and Bad; therefore, pray let us go on with the Enquiry, and if we can find out this One in forty, if we can &s;how you his <HI>Star</HI> in the <HI>Ea&s;t,</HI> we hope you will join with us to go and wor&s;hip him.</P>
<P>But where &s;hall we look for him? In what Quarter of the World &s;hall we hear of him? Is there no Old Prophecy, to guide us in the Enquiry, $word$ <HI>Merlin, No&s;trada|mus, Mother Shipton, Lilly, Gadbury, Partridge,</HI> and all the Sooth&s;ayers of the Age? Can his Character be found in none of the Calendars, or among the Strange and Wonder|fuls of the Times? Let us Enquire nicely, and who knows what may be the con&s;equence of a diligent Search.</P>
<P>Really, Gentlemen, after having ran&s;ack'd <HI>Europe</HI> for Pious Kings, Men of Hone&s;ty and Principles, Men of Religion, wearing the Badge of Sovereignty upon their Heads, and the Stamp of Chri&s;tian in their Hearts, having rummag'd Hi&s;tory, and &s;ingl'd out a very few, I cannot but inform you who they are.</P>
<P>But before I come to them, I think 'tis needful to let you &s;ee how much fruitle&s;s Pains has been taken this way, and how much Labour lo&s;t; in &s;hort, to give you the Negatives where we found it not.</P>
<P>And, Fir&s;t, we came to <HI>Rome;</HI> Any body would ha' thought to ha' found Religion there; and tho' a Man with one Crown upon his Head, might be a Sinner, he that had three Crowns, who claim'd the Divine Succe&s;&s;ion, and the Mi&s;&s;ion of the Infallible Spirit, mu&s;t needs be the Man; here we began to &s;ing <HI>Nunc dimittis</HI> with Old
<PB N="5" REF="4">
<HI>Simeon,</HI> and de&s;ign'd to call the Place <HI>Bethel,</HI> and to write over it, <HI>Surely the Lord is in this Place, and I knew it not.</HI></P>
<P>But when we &s;earch'd into the Holy Juggle, and &s;aw clearly the Sacred Fraud; how Intere&s;t govern'd all their Pretences, and what prodigious Cheats were conceal'd under the Pontif of St. <HI>Peter;</HI> when, with the Prophet <HI>Ezekiel,</HI> we were carry'd into the Inner Rooms, and vi&s;ited the Chambers of Abomination; when, by the Unbia&s;s'd Eye of Rea&s;on and Reflexion, we en|tred into the Apartments of Darkne&s;s, and &s;aw the <HI>Arcana</HI> of the Sanctified See, a &s;udden Light &s;hone into the Place, and di&s;covered this Golden In&s;cription, written on the In&s;ide of the <HI>Sancta Ca&s;a</HI> of the <HI>Vatican,</HI>
<Q><L>Heu quantum profuit hoec Fabula Chri&s;ti!</L></Q>
Away we came; we had enough of the Search.</P>
<P>From thence we con&s;idered the Imperial Court, his Imperial Maje&s;ty's Piety, his Zeal in Religion, his Holy Life, his Bare-footed Proce&s;&s;ions, his Religious Ob&s;erva|tion of Treaties and Confederates, and the like, we con|cluded,
<Q><L>Hic jacet in Tumulo Religio Religio&s;$.</L></Q>
But &s;earching a little farther into the Treaties of <HI>Ca&s;chaw,</HI> and the &s;undry Capitulations with the poor Prote&s;tants&punc; of <HI>Hungaria,</HI> and finding among &s;ome Old Records of Count <HI>Teckely</HI>'s, which were taken in the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Mongatz,</HI> a &s;ad and melancholy account of Bloody Ma&s;&s;acres and Cruel Deva&s;tations committed on the Prote&s;tants, under the &s;o|lemne&s;t Treaties and Engagements, and repeated Oaths of Parties: and a Prote&s;tation made by Count <HI>Secini</HI> be|fore his Death, that they found it &s;afer to tru&s;t the Faith of the <HI>Turk</HI> than the Emperor, and a great dead of &s;uch Black Stuff as this: We concluded in the Words of the Angel, <HI>Re&s;urrexit, non e&s;t hic.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="5">
We pa&s;s'd from hence into <HI>Poland;</HI> never did poor Enqui|rers meet with &s;uch Di&s;appointments; here we found a new King, and a new Convert, both in one; they &s;aid, he had lately chang'd his Religion; but upon Enquiry, we &s;ound that a Mi&s;take, for it was plainly prov'd he had none before: So it was concluded, he had newly embrac'd Re|ligion, as &s;uch, and as might rea&s;onably be expected from a Man newly become a Chri&s;tian; we made no que&s;tion but we &s;hould find a Warm Zeal, a Hearty Profe&s;&s;ion, and a Red-hot Chri&s;tian; we found he went con&s;tantly to Ma&s;s, and &s;aid over his <HI>Aves</HI> and <HI>Paterno&s;ters</HI> mo&s;t Religiou&s;ly; was con&s;tantly at <HI>Ve&s;pers,</HI> and ro&s;e before Day to his <HI>Mat|tins;</HI> and now we thought we had found Religion out: but all of a &s;udden his <HI>Saxon</HI> Troops began to march, and without &s;o much as declaring War, without Quarrel, with|out Pretence, without the lea&s;t Shadow of Hone&s;ty, he in|vaded <HI>Livonia,</HI> depending upon the Minority of the King of <HI>Swedeland,</HI> and his being at the &s;ame time embarre&s;&s;ed with a War in <HI>Denmark.</HI></P>
<P>We were agoing to quit <HI>Poland</HI> upon this, when on a &s;udden we were call'd to look back to the Cardinal Primate, who being in the <HI>Interregnum</HI> the Sovereign of <HI>Poland,</HI> de&s;erves our Notice; and being a Prince and a Prie&s;t, both together, Sanctified in Life, and Sacred in Per&s;on, we had a wonderful Opinion of him; but hear|ing that he being a Roman Catholick Prelate, had join'd with a Heretick Prince to depo&s;e his Roman Catholick Ma&s;ter; it appear'd, his Politick Intere&s;t had got Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his Religious; and &s;o we laid him by as an Hermaphro|dite in Religion, and made a Trip to <HI>Mo&s;covy.</HI></P>
<P>The Czar of <HI>Mo&s;covy,</HI> we were told, was a Furious Chri&s;tian, and we did not know but he might have &s;omething of this Divine Quality in him; but when we examined things, and found him executing two or three thou&s;and People in a day, putting whole Families to
<PB N="7" REF="6">
Death for the Offences of one of the Blood; we knew Re|ligion too well, to look any longer for her in Tyranny and Barbarity, and &s;o we found our Labour in Vain there too.</P>
<P>The late Duke of <HI>Hol&s;tein,</HI> had been &s;o Raki&s;h with the <HI>Swede,</HI> and made &s;uch loud Clamours at the <HI>Dane,</HI> that we De&s;pair'd of finding this Royal-Religion in tho&s;e Parts; it had been Entertain'd a great while by the Young King of <HI>Sweden</HI>'s Father, <HI>Charles</HI> the Eleventh; but he being Dead, it fled from the Clime, for fear of being Frozen to Death, before this Young Hero was at Lei&s;ure for it.</P>
<P>We con&s;idered, <HI>France</HI> is a Kingdom, in which much of this Matter had been Talk'd of: we Examin'd the Crown'd Legend back to <HI>Henry</HI> the Third; he was a mo&s;t Zealous Prince, and Exceeding Pious; but the Barbarous Murther of the Duke of <HI>Gui&s;e</HI> blotted him quite out of Our Roll.</P>
<P><HI>Henry</HI> the Fourth, Encourag'd us to find it in his Story; he having been a Champion for his Religion, and Main|tained a Bloody War for Seventeen years, again&s;t almo&s;t all the Power of <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Spain;</HI> but when at la&s;t he was put to the Tryal, he &s;hew'd the World, he Fought for the Crown, and not for the Religion, for he Denied the la&s;t, to Enjoy the fir&s;t.</P>
<P><HI>Lewis</HI> the Thirteenth, Gave us to under&s;tand, he had more Zeal than Religion; and at fir&s;t view of his Hi&s;tory, bid us not Trouble Our Heads with it, for he was not the Man.</P>
<P>The pre&s;ent King of <HI>France,</HI> bids exceeding Fair, for the Mo&s;t Religious Prince in the World: If innumerable Re|liques, which hang about every Part of his Body, if alight|ing out of his Coach and Kneeling down in the Dirt, in the very High-Way, while the Ble&s;&s;ed Ho&s;t is Carried by, with <HI>Infinite Te Deums at No&s;tre-Dame;</HI> and Thanking God for more Victories than ever he Gave him, will Di&s;tingui&s;h a Monarch to be a Man of Religion, this is He.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="7">
What, tho' the Blood of Thou&s;ands of Towns and Villa|ges, who&s;e Inhabitants have been Murthered in his Sight, are a Pretence for &s;ome People to le&s;&s;en his Immortal Cha|racter; the&s;e are the Effects of War, which his Enemies have forced him to, by pre&s;uming to Check the Current of his Conque&s;ts, and his Ju&s;t pur&s;uit of Glory.</P>
<P>What, tho' 'tis pretended he has Unju&s;tly Di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;s'd the Princes of <HI>Lorrain,</HI> and the <HI>Spaniard</HI> in <HI>Burgogne;</HI> what, tho' he Invaded the <HI>Dutch</HI> in Seventy two, and Over-run their whole Country, without Declaring War; what, tho' he Bombarded <HI>Genoa,</HI> and laid the mo&s;t Glorious Pal|laces of the <HI>Senators</HI> in A&s;hes; all the&s;e are but nece&s;&s;ary Corrections of tho&s;e Petty Neighbouring Princes, who ju&s;t|ly De&s;erv'd it for Di&s;obeying the Commands of the Great|e&s;t Prince in the World.</P>
<P>What, tho' he has Di&s;&s;olv'd the Edict of <HI>Nants,</HI> and Ba|ni&s;h'd Three Hundred Thou&s;and of his Prote&s;tant Subjects; this is but a farther Confirmation of his Steadine&s;s and Zeal for the Church, and con&s;equently of his being Ma|&s;ter of Religion; and &s;ince no Faith is to be kept with He|reticks, who &s;hall blame him for u&s;ing his Prote&s;tant Sub|jects as he did, Zeal for Religion might move him to that: be&s;ides, being an Ab&s;olute Monarch, and having the &s;ame Right to his People, as a Farmer has to his Cattel, &s;hall any one ask him what he does with his Own; If any one ask &s;uch a Fooli&s;h Que&s;tion, 'tis a Sign they do not know what belongs to Arbitrary-Power.</P>
<P>All the&s;e Things had never Diverted us from our fixing this Royal Quality with this Heroick King, had he not Lately Di&s;oblig'd us in breaking the Treaty of Partition, &s;olemnly Made, Ratified and Exchang'd, and in &s;eizing the Monar|chy of <HI>Spain,</HI> which we can no way Reconcile to the Te&s;t of his mo&s;t Illu&s;trious Character.</P>
<P>The Duke of <HI>Savoy</HI> came next in View, for though he is not a King, he wou'd be one; and rather than not be
<PB N="9" REF="8">
call'd a King, is Content with the empty Title, without a Kingdom, and be call'd King of <HI>Jeru&s;alem;</HI> which, as the <HI>French</HI> man &s;aid, is to be his, <HI>when he can catch.</HI></P>
<P>There's a Prodigious Face of Religion, on all this Prince's Behaviour; and take him as a Man, I hardly find &s;uch ano|ther in a Station &s;o high; Virtue &s;eems to be mixt with Ga|lantry, throughout all the Concerns of his Court, and they are the be&s;t Regulated Hou&s;hold in <HI>Europe;</HI> Religion has a peculiar Intere&s;t in his Family; and in &s;hort, had we never &s;een him in the Field, he had pa&s;t for a very Religious Prince.</P>
<P>But, when we came into his Cabinet, and found him Tracing the Steps of his Subtil Progenitor, <HI>Charles Ema|nuel;</HI> when we found he fir&s;t broke his Faith with the Con|federacy, afterwards with the <HI>French,</HI> Married his Daugh|ter to a King, and then refus'd her the Title of Queen; when we found him to Day per&s;ecuting his Subjects of the Val|leys, to morrow haranguing them as his faithful Friends, and putting Arms into their Hands.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, when we found him Fal&s;e and Fickle, we con|cluded the Princes of <HI>Europe</HI> were to blame to be Cheated Twice, but they mu&s;t be mad that venture him the Third time; in &s;hort, we found 'twas to no purpo&s;e, to continue the Search of Religion among Politicks and Intrigues; and that whatever that Prince may do in advancing his Royal Character, 'tis pa&s;t doubt, that he'll never much Improve his Religious; he may make him&s;elf be own'd for a King, &s;ooner than he will ever pa&s;s with us for a Chri&s;tian, and &s;o we turn'd our Backs upon him.</P>
<P>We were at &s;ome lo&s;s now, where to carry on the Search; <HI>Europe</HI> was found &s;o barren of this Royal Quality, that we had &s;ome thought of going over into <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> and look for it among the <HI>Turks,</HI> but we altered that ra&s;h Re&s;olution, and turn'd about to look into <HI>Spain.</HI></P>
<P>Here we found two Kings, but both Young, and having &s;hown very little of their Piety in the World, we left them
<PB N="10" REF="9">
to fight it out. Not Doubting but he will be the mo&s;t Religious King that keeps the Crown longe&s;t, becau&s;e Succe&s;s &s;anctifies all the Frauds of Life.</P>
<P>We only wi&s;h, neither the <HI>French</HI> on one Hand, nor the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> or <HI>Dutch</HI> on the other Hand, would concern them|&s;elves in the Quarrel, but leave that War for the Diver&s;ion of <HI>Europe,</HI> to be Carried on by tho&s;e Two Warlike Nations, the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> and the <HI>Portugue&s;e:</HI> Never &s;uch a Farce was Acted on the Stage of the World, as wou'd be there; as to Fighting, Swaggering, Running Away, &amp;c.</P>
<P><HI>Portugal</HI> came next in Our Thoughts, and a great deal of the &s;how of Religion and Piety has been &s;een in the Pa|lace of the Court at <HI>Lisbon;</HI> but when we come to De|po&s;ing of Brothers, and going to Bed to their Wives; taking the Crown from the King's Head, and then lying with his Wife, we never Examined Circum&s;tances; but as to <HI>Reli|gion-Royal,</HI> we found it would never do.</P>
<P>At la&s;t, we came to <HI>E&mdash;, K&mdash;C</HI>&mdash;the Fir&s;t, pre&s;ent|ed him&s;elf the likelie&s;t Object; for if a Man can give a greater Demon&s;tration of his Love to Religion, than Dying for the Church, we are mi&s;taken; and therefore we cannot forbear affirming, that certainly we have found the fir&s;t of the &s;ort at home.</P>
<P>An Ill Natur'd <HI>Calves-Head Di&s;&s;enter,</HI> &s;tept in, and ob|jected Three Things; the Book of Sports, Executing L. <HI>Strafford</HI> again&s;t his Con&s;cience, and taking a Prayer out of the Romance call'd&mdash;and putting it into his Book of <HI>Eikon Ba&s;ilik&eacute;.</HI></P>
<P>As to the fir&s;t and the la&s;t, they appear to be none of his Actions, the One put out by <HI>A. B. L.</HI> and the Other put in by and as to the Ca&s;e of the Lord <HI>Strafford,</HI> he publickly Repented of it.</P>
<P>Great Claim has been put in for this Matter, on behalf of the Two Crown'd Sons of the la&s;t Mention'd P&mdash;ce.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="10">
As to the fir&s;t, If above Fifty B&mdash;ds with Innumerable In|&s;tances of Lewdne&s;s; if pretending all his Days to be a Pro|te&s;tant, and at the &s;ame time being a &s;uppo&s;ed P&mdash;; if the&s;e things will not bar him from the Claim to Religion, he &s;hall have my Vote.</P>
<P>His Brother without doubt, has a much better Claim, and there is no que&s;tion, but when the Hundred Years are Compleat, &s;hall receive a Badge of Saint&s;hip from <HI>Rome;</HI> mean time, this mu&s;t be own'd, let his Real Religion be what it will, he Suffer'd as much for it as any Man of his Character in the World, but his Memory won't go down with the <HI>Engli&s;h;</HI> and if I &s;hou'd &s;ay, he was the Man, no Body would believe me.</P>
<P>If any Man Charge this as a Banter on Crown'd heads, and on Religion, I tell 'em they are Mi&s;taken; and as there is too much Matter of Fact in the Hi&s;tory of it, &s;o I mu&s;t tell them, 'tis le&s;s than a ju&s;t Return to tho&s;e hot Mouth'd Gentlemen, who have be&s;tow'd a Plentiful &s;torm of their Wit, as they call it, upon a Manual call'd, A Collection of Prayers, u&s;ed by King <HI>William.</HI></P>
<P>I know nothing, but the General Scandal on the Religion of Princes, which can be a Handle for the&s;e Gentlemens Railery; and becau&s;e, perhaps few of the Kings of <HI>Europe,</HI> ever troubl'd them&s;elves with Private Devotion, therefore the late King mu&s;t be &s;o too.</P>
<P>Princes perform the Duties of Religion, as a Matter of State, and common Court-Ceremony appoints the Cha|plains in Ordinary to attend at their Sea&s;on; the Hours of Prayer, are Regulated as the Hours of Play, and the Clerk of the Clo&s;et, has his Work al&s;o; the&s;e are hand|&s;ome General ways of Treating God Almighty Civilly, and the Prince vouch&s;afes to be pre&s;ent, as often as he plea&s;es; and we are very willing to Cry up the Devotion and Piety of tho&s;e that do &s;o.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="11">
But as for Clo&s;et Secret Devotion, Private Serious Prayer, Hearty Application to the God and Maker of us all, commit|ting all to his Conduct, &s;eeking the Face of the Almighty, his Favour, Protection, Coun&s;el and Ble&s;&s;ing; we Challenge Hi&s;tory of Times pa&s;t, or Experience of Time within Me|mory, to match the In&s;tance before us.</P>
<P>As to the Matter of Fact, which &s;ome have the Impu|dence to Que&s;tion, I appeal to the Te&s;timony Given by the Late Reverend and Learned Prelate Dr. <HI>Tillot&s;on,</HI> Late L. A. B. of <HI>Canterbury;</HI> which Te&s;timony, as I have had the Honour to hear him Expre&s;s, &s;o there are many Liv|ing Witne&s;&s;es of it.</P>
<P>I &s;et this in the Front of the Debate, becau&s;e, even tho&s;e who are willing to believe the be&s;t of his Late Maje&s;ty, and would be glad to have it True, are yet forward to ask, of the Book of Prayers Publi&s;h'd in his Maje&s;ties Name, <HI>Do you really believe the King made u&s;e of them.</HI></P>
<P>I confe&s;s, the Novelty of the thing, the rarity of a Pray|ing Prince, may make the Que&s;tion the more Excu&s;able.</P>
<P>But I proceed to Con&s;ider, his Late Maje&s;ty in his Soli|tudes, and to Examine, what Authority we have to believe, that the&s;e Prayers Publi&s;h'd as his, are <HI>Genuine.</HI></P>
<P>Fir&s;t, I affirm the Late Dr. <HI>Tillot&s;on,</HI> has often Expre&s;s'd him&s;elf of his Maje&s;ty, thus, That he was a very Devout Per&s;on, and a Con&s;tant Ob&s;erver of Religious Duties, both in Publick and Private.</P>
<P>Secondly, I Appeal to his Lord&s;hip, the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Nor|wich,</HI> and to his Preface to this Manual; wherein he gives an Account of the Con&s;tant Solemnity his Maje&s;ty ob&s;erv'd, in the Receiving the Sacrament, and the Extraordinary time of Preparation, which he Separated for him&s;elf, from the mo&s;t Pre&s;&s;ing Affairs, even in the very Camp; which I give you in his Lord&s;hips Words, thus; here is plainly the Pi|cture of a Serious and Devout Chri&s;tian King, and the Au|thority of a Chri&s;tian Bi&s;hop to Confirm it.</P>
<DIV2>
<PB N="13" REF="12">
<HEAD>The Preface to the PRAYERS.</HEAD>
<P><Q>&startq;&endq;THe&s;e Prayers are faithfully Printed without the lea&s;t Variation from the Original Papers, which his Maje&s;ty con&s;tantly u&s;ed.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;&endq;Although they were admirably &s;uited to the Circum|&s;tances of his Maje&s;ty's Royal Condition, yet the Matter of them is cho&s;en with &s;o much Judgment, that they in a manner comprehend all the things for which a Chri&s;ti|an Man ought to Pray; and may afford great A&s;&s;i&s;tance to vertuou&s;ly di&s;po&s;ed Per&s;ons of all Ranks and Qualities in their Religious Exerci&s;es.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;&endq;By their being made Publick, Men will &s;ee the high Re|gard his Maje&s;ty had for the Duties of the Chri&s;tian Reli|gion, and how well he employed him&s;elf at the Lord's Table; where his Behaviour was ever mo&s;t Grave, Hum|ble, and Devout.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;&endq;As often as his Maje&s;ty received the Sacrament, which he never failed to do four times in the Year, he always &s;et apart two or three Days to prepare him&s;elf for it.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;&endq;When he was in the Camp, if urgent Affairs put him by the Sea&s;ons he u&s;ually allotted for his Preparation# he ordered the Sacrament to be deferr'd till the Lord's Day following, that he might have Opportunity to fit him&s;elf worthily to partake of tho&s;e Holy My&s;teries.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;&endq;There is al&s;o very good Rea&s;on to believe, that he made u&s;e of &s;ome of the&s;e Prayers, every Morning and Evening, when he retir'd into his Clo&s;et to Pray; in which Daily Devotions, they, who had the Honour to attend his Per|&s;on, well knew, that he was mo&s;t Con&s;tant and Re|gular.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="13">
<Q>&startq;&endq;It is therefore hoped, that &s;ome Right hereby will be done to the Sacred Memory of that excellent Prince, who was the Glorious In&s;trument of pre&s;erving the pure Re|ligion, the Ancient Laws, and known Liberties of this Kingdom.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;&endq;Which Invaluable Ble&s;&s;ings, he hath al&s;o perpetuated to us by e&s;tabli&s;hing the Succe&s;&s;ion of the Crown in the Prote&s;tant Line, and leaving the immediate Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion thereof to her pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty, our mo&s;t Gracious Sove|reign Queen <HI>ANNE.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Here's a Living Te&s;timony from an Unbia&s;s'd Pen, and from an Unque&s;tion'd Authority, to the Piety and Re|ligion of a Devout Prince.</P>
<P>If his Lord&s;hip, the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Norwich,</HI> had any need for me to give the World his Character, to add to the Reputation of his Te&s;timony, &s;omething might be ex|pected that way.</P>
<P>But as he is a Per&s;on eminent in Piety, as well as in Office, of a known and un&s;potted Integrity, and a Practicer of that very Quality which he applauds in his Chri&s;tian Sovereign, there can lie no Objection again&s;t the Truth of it, but what will be a Satyr upon it|&s;elf.</P>
<P>His Lord&s;hip's De&s;ign too, mu&s;t be plainly and up|rightly, what he profe&s;&s;es, <HI>viz.</HI> to do right to the Sa|cred Memory of that Excellent Prince, who was the Glorious In&s;trument of pre&s;erving the Pure Religion, the Ancient Laws, and the known Liberties of this Kingdom.</P>
<P>This was not a Time for my Lord to expect much from the World, for either pre&s;erving the Memory, or recommending the Example of King <HI>William,</HI> when &s;o many value them&s;elves upon Ill-treating him on both Accounts.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="14">
My Lord of <HI>Norwich</HI> therefore, &s;tands &s;o much the clearer in that Point, by how much there is no room to imagine, his De&s;ign could be any thing el&s;e than he expre&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>Thirdly, I Appeal to his Menial Attendants, who&s;e Te|&s;timony, will &s;till Confirm the particular, as to the Time which his Maje&s;ty every Day &s;et apart for Private Devotion; and without breach of Charity, I can &s;ay, I do believe few a|bout him &s;par'd &s;o much time for the Solemn Occa&s;ion of Private Prayer, as the King him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Fourthly, I Appeal to the Eye Witne&s;&s;es of his Actions in the Field; and there are Thou&s;ands of Gentlemen, who Declare, they never knew him Enter upon any Great Action, but that Immediately before he adventur'd him&s;elf, he recommended him&s;elf to the Divine Protection; as par|ticularly at the Great Battel of <HI>Landen,</HI> where the Night before the Battel, his Maje&s;ty Lodg'd in his Coach, and in the Morning had his Chaplain call'd into the Coach, to pray with him.</P>
<P>I need not tell the World, with what Undauntedne&s;s of Re&s;olution he adventured into the Hotte&s;t Action; how Fearle&s;s and Unconcern'd, he look'd in the Face of Danger; after having thus prepar'd him&s;elf for Death, Hi&s;tory is too full of his Prodigious Actions, and the Minds of Men have too great an <HI>Idea</HI> of his Exalted Memory, to require any &s;uch Excur&s;ion of my Pen. But I mu&s;t &s;ay, I firmly believe, it was the con&s;tant preparedne&s;s of his Condition, that &s;et|tled and fix'd his Temper, in a perfect Re&s;ignation to the Sovereign Di&s;po&s;al, and caus'd him to be perfectly Hearty and Unconcern'd, in the Greate&s;t Danger: Since no Man can be &s;o truly brave, as the Man who&s;e Con&s;cience &s;peaks com|fortable things to him, in the Minute of Danger.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="15">
After all the&s;e particular In&s;tances, I Appeal to the Man|ner of his Death; with what Compo&s;ure of Mind did he prepare for it; with what Ea&s;ine&s;s did he talk of him&s;elf, and of the Affairs of the Kingdom; with what Freedom did he quit all the Great Things of the World; how did he lay down the Scepter as a Burthen, and re&s;ign the Crown with a Willingne&s;s, too Great to be Counterfeited.</P>
<P>We are apt to &s;u&s;pect the Solemne&s;t and mo&s;t Publick Ap|pearances of Living Devotion; but at the Hour of Death, it's another thing, he that can Di&s;&s;emble then, is arriv'd to a Degree of hardne&s;s, beyond what the wor&s;t Enemy could ever &s;ugge&s;t of him.</P>
<P>And I wi&s;h, &s;ome good Pen were admitted to Print, what a certain highly Dignified Prelate, has often been plea&s;ed to relate, of what pa&s;&s;ed between his late Maje&s;ty and him&s;elf, in the la&s;t Moments of his Life, after his Receiving the Sacrament, and during his other Prepara|tions for Death.</P>
<P>'Tis known, his Maje&s;ty was not &s;urpriz'd with Death on a &s;uddain, but had &s;ome Days Notice, and Time and Strength &s;ufficient to Declare him&s;elf freely, and did &s;o.</P>
<P>The chief End of renewing the&s;e Melancholy Parts of his Actions, is to make it appear, that it is not &s;o Improbable a Story, that the&s;e Prayers Publi&s;h'd by the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Norwich,</HI> and &s;aid to be u&s;ed by the late King, were <HI>Genuine,</HI> and were really his own.</P>
<P>The Affirmative, the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Norwich,</HI> who&s;e Hand is to the Work, has made &s;olemn; and as the Negative can ne|ver be proved, I think nothing can de&s;ire a greater Confir|mation.</P>
<P><HI>Probability Clear, Proof Po&s;itive, Circum&s;tances Concurring;</HI> he that would not hang a Thief on tho&s;e Three Heads, ought to be hang'd him&s;elf; he that will doubt after the&s;e
<PB N="17" REF="16">
Heads thus clear'd up, will Doubt for ever, and ought to have all men Doubt, both his Hone&s;ty and his Under&s;tand|ing.</P>
<P>And after all, what can be the Rea&s;on, and who the Per|&s;ons that make u&s;e of them, again&s;t the Memory of his Maje&s;ty?</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> 'Tis remarkably vi&s;ible, all that are Enemies to the pre&s;ent E&s;tabli&s;hment, hate his Memory, vilifie his Name, and endeavour to le&s;&s;en his Glory, and <HI>&egrave; contra,</HI> generally &s;peaking, all tho&s;e who reflect on the Memory of King <HI>William,</HI> hate the pre&s;ent Government: Would you have the Character of a High Church-man painted in little, his Prologue is <HI>Prayer,</HI> his Epilogue is <HI>Anathema</HI>'s and <HI>Cur|&s;es, Pa&s;&s;ive Obedience</HI> and the Church is the Introduction, and Railing at King <HI>William</HI> is the Conclu&s;ion.</P>
<P>Show me a Pamphlet, a <HI>New A&s;&s;ociation,</HI> a <HI>Wolf &s;tript.</HI> But as the Danger of the Church is the Pretence, Railings, Wide Reflections upon King <HI>William</HI> and his Memory, are the Means.</P>
<P>To who&s;e Charge do they lay the horrid Crime of e&s;ta|bli&s;hing Schi&s;m by a Law, and introducing the damnable Act of Toleration? 'Tis all heap'd up to the Reproach of the Memory of King <HI>William.</HI></P>
<P>Who do they charge with filling the Eccle&s;ia&s;tick Pre|ferments with Enemies to the Church, and putting in Presbyterian Bi&s;hops? 'Tis all laid at the Door of King <HI>William.</HI></P>

<P>'Tis King <HI>William</HI> they call an U&s;urper, and yet pretend her Maje&s;ty is not concern'd in the Matter; as if the Queen's Title did not depend upon the Validity of the Revolution.</P>
<P>'Tis to him they lay the &s;ubjecting the Divine Authority of Princes to the Bondage of Laws and the Slavery of Par|liaments, and making the Maje&s;ty of Heaven, <HI>repre&s;ented in his Vicegerent the King,</HI> &s;toop to the Supremacy of Original and Collective Power.</P>
<P>'Tis this Man's Memory they cur&s;e for Depriving them of the &s;weet Revenues rai&s;ed out of the Per&s;ecuted Di&s;&s;en|ters, and the whol&s;ome Advantage of Plundering their Neighbours.</P>
<P>'Tis the hated Memory of King <HI>William</HI> they blame for interrupting the Succe&s;&s;ion in the Right-Line, and prevent|ing a General Union of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>French</HI> Principles as well as Power.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, All our <HI>French</HI> Wars, our <HI>Dutch</HI> Settlement, our Whiggi&s;h Lords, all our Taxes, our Debts and Deficiencies, the Danger of the Church, the terrible Encroachments of Di&s;&s;enters; it's all King <HI>William;</HI> he was an <HI>Occa&s;ional Con|formi&s;t,</HI> a <HI>Lutheran,</HI> a <HI>Presbyterian;</HI> nay, the Author of this has a rallying Letter &s;ent him from a Clergy-man of the <HI>Church of England,</HI> who calls King <HI>William</HI> a <HI>Papi&s;t,</HI> and a <HI>Jacobite.</HI></P>
<P>'Tis &s;trange to me, they never charg'd him with a De&s;ign to bring in the <HI>French</HI> Army, and re&s;tore King <HI>James.</HI></P>

No wonder the&s;e Gentlemen won't believe the Prayers we &s;peak of, were ever made u&s;e of by him; if he as certainly us'd tho&s;e Prayers as they con&s;tantly pray'd for his Confu|&s;ion, they are certainly genuine.</P>
<P>I look on it as a &s;ingular Providence, that the&s;e Prayers came u&s;her'd into the World under the Patronage of &s;o Re|verend a Hand; after who&s;e Name put to the Introduction, the Authentick Copy can have no Objection.</P>

<P>Had the Book come out without a Name, it had met with forty Ridiculing Banters in Print before now; it had been call'd a Fanatick Plot, a Sham of the Party; and <HI>J.

<P>Mr. <HI>L. ali&agrave;s W.</HI> who never &s;wore to this Government, and &s;wears he never will; would ha' made another <HI>Wolf &s;tript</HI> of it, and have call'd it a <HI>New A&s;&s;ociation;</HI> from whence his &s;tigmatizing Pen would certainly, according to his u&s;ual &s;hare of Bra&s;s, have told the World the Party were plotting to bring King <HI>William</HI> to Life again, and depo&s;ing Queen <HI>Anne</HI> to &s;et him up again.</P>
<P>That Voluminous Gentleman is humbly de&s;ir'd, the next time he is pleas'd to reflect on the Memory of King <HI>William,</HI> and his Title to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Crown, to let the World know how he can make that out not to be an Invective, a meer Satyr upon the Queen.</P>
<P>Al&s;o, he is de&s;ir'd to tell us, how he can have the Face to compliment Her Maje&s;ty, and Her &s;itting on the Throne of her Ance&s;tors, and yet refu&s;e to take the Oaths, and re|cognize her ju&s;t Title? and, whether if any Man &s;hould let
<PB N="20" REF="19">
Her Maje&s;ty know it, She wou'd not believe he had the Im|pudence to Banter Her?</P>
<P>As to the Memory of King <HI>William,</HI> it needs no Addition from my Pen; it lives with a profound E&s;teem in the Mind of every True <HI>Engli&s;h-man,</HI> that has a Value for the Prote|&s;tant Religion, and the Peace of his Native Country; it lives abroad in the Hearts of all Nations, where he has made good the Saying of our Saviour, <HI>That a Prophet's Honour is not in his own Country.</HI></P>
<P>I confe&s;s, I am at a lo&s;s how to imagine, any Prote&s;tant can reflect upon King <HI>William,</HI> if a Roman Catholick does not re&s;pect his Memory, or did not love his Per&s;on; I can neither wonder at it, nor blame them; for I cannot cen&s;ure any Man for being Faithful to what he profe&s;&s;es: But for a <HI>Church of England</HI> Man, who actually join'd in the Revo|lution, as they in general did for him, to turn upon the King, I wou'd fain ask &s;uch Gentlemen, What wou'd they have had?</P>
<P>If they did not join in the Prince's Expedition, they could hardly be Church-men; for the whole Church was in the thing, and King <HI>James</HI> own'd it to be &s;o to the la&s;t; and when the Mob took him at <HI>Fever&s;ham,</HI> and he &s;aw a Clergy|man in the Crowd, he call'd him to him, and de&s;ir'd him to &s;peak to the People to be quiet, and with Tears in his Eyes told him, <HI>Sir, 'Tis the Men of your Coat have brought me to this;</HI> and repeated it twice with great earne&s;tne&s;s and con|cern.</P>
<P>Now the Church-men being wholly concern'd, I don't &s;ay only concern'd but wholly, in bringing in a Foreign Power; and this they carry'd on till the late King went a|way. What is it they would have had? I cou'd never &s;ee one of their Books or Writings that propos'd a <HI>Medium;</HI> &s;ince they did not approve of King <HI>William</HI>'s being &s;et up, what wou'd they ha' done?</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="20">
What is it they would have had? A Protector would never ha' pleas'd them, the Word would ha' &s;melt too rank: I wi&s;h they would tell us what Articles, what Conditions would they have made with their Angry Prince, to have re&s;tor'd him, and recall'd him, and how would they have oblig'd him to keep them.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t People who are di&s;contented at the pre&s;ent Condi|tion, can tell, how it might be made better; but the&s;e Peo|ple cannot pre&s;cribe a Method, what el&s;e at that time they could ha' done, and how they could ha' been &s;afe in their Property and Religion.</P>
<P>We demand therefore a Ce&s;&s;ation of their Tongue as to <HI>Billingsgate,</HI> and Reproach upon King <HI>William</HI> and the late Revolution, &s;o long at lea&s;t, as till they tell us what Me|dium cou'd have &s;upplied the filling up the Throne with the late King <HI>William</HI> and Queen <HI>Mary,</HI> and how Property, Liberty, and the Prote&s;tant Religion, could ha' been &s;e|cur'd.</P>
<P>If they cannot Reply to this, what have they to &s;ay to King <HI>William?</HI> And why all this ill Language and Re|proach upon his Memory, that they will not allow him to be a King, nor a Chri&s;tian.</P>
<P>As to his Actions in the Field, or on the Throne, they are far from wanting my Pen to defend them; but as to his Per&s;onal Piety, his Real Religion, I take the Freedom to af|firm, from unque&s;tionable Witne&s;s, ju&s;tifiable Authority, and &s;ome little po&s;itive Knowledge, He was a Prince of the greate&s;t Piety, Sincerity, and unfeigned Religion, as either Hi&s;tory relates, or Memory informs of in the World; and I am not convinc'd, that I need not except any Crown'd Head that ever Reign'd, except, and only except his Royal Con&s;ort, and her Glorious Si&s;ter.</P>
<P>If he was not a Prince of Religion, let them &s;how me a Prince in the World that ever was! And 'twould take up a large Volume to run back the Parallel to the beginning of Hi&s;tory.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="21">
I confe&s;s, it would too much reproach the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Calen|dar, to ran&s;ack our Throne, to find a Prince equal to King <HI>William;</HI> and 'tis a misfortune, that the Character of our Kings will not bear a Secret Hi&s;tory: We have not above two or three Crown'd Heads that <HI>England</HI> can pretend to, before King <HI>William,</HI> who&s;e Character values it&s;elf upon that frail Article, call'd <HI>The Religion of Princes;</HI> it has been &s;o remote from their general Practice, that really it has nor been much in the Pretence; and indeed, I have never read over the Scruples King <HI>Henry</HI> the Eighth made, about put|ting away his Wife <HI>Katherine</HI> of <HI>Spain,</HI> without my thoughts fill'd with the utmo&s;t Contempt both of the Per&s;ons and the Times, to hear them call'd Scruples of Con&s;cience; and Bi&s;hops, and all &s;orts of Eccle&s;ia&s;ticks, were &s;ummon'd to|gether to &s;atisfie the King's Con&s;cience, a Mi&s;&s;ion to <HI>Rome;</HI> and an Examination of Matters in the Points of Con&s;angui|nity in all the Univer&s;ities in <HI>Europe,</HI> were carried on with all po&s;&s;ible Vigour, and all for the &s;atisfaction of his Ma|je&s;ty's Con&s;cience.</P>
<P>Had &s;ome of the States-men of that Age, found out ways to ha' &s;atisfied another importuning Affair in his Maje&s;ty's Con&s;titution, they might ha' taken much le&s;s Pains about his Con&s;cience; for if it may be gue&s;s'd by the re&s;t of his Conduct, if the After-management of that Prince may be the Te&s;t of his real Tenderne&s;s, no Man in the World &s;hew'd le&s;s Concern for Religion, otherwi&s;e than it &s;erv'd to cover the De&s;ign of his Lu&s;t, his Covetou&s;ne&s;s, or his Tyrannick Temper.</P>
<P>Indeed, we have had &s;o much of this Royal Banter in former Ages in <HI>England,</HI> that a Prince ought to have more Religion in him than ever King had before him, before he can expect the World &s;hould believe he has any more Sin|cerity than his Ance&s;tors.</P>

<P>But, what &s;hall we &s;ay to the In&s;trument? God Almighty was pleas'd to &s;how the Sovereignty of his Government and to let us &s;ee he can &s;anctifie the De&s;ign, in any Work, without &s;anctifying the Agent; and had the Abbeys and Mona&s;teries in <HI>England</HI> been poor and empty Cells, had the Lands, and not the Monks and Prie&s;ts, been out of the way, had he not had more occa&s;ion for the Revenues than the Reformation of the Church; I believe I make no Breach upon my Charity, when I &s;ay, that in all probability they had &s;tood to this Day, that is, at lea&s;t from any di&s;turbance they might ha' found from the Con&s;cience of that King.</P>
<P>Con&s;cience! what a &s;trange Play-thing did that King make of his Con&s;cience!</P>
<P N="1">1. In putting away his Wife after he had liv'd eighteen years with her; and as often as he had a mind to a New Bed-fellow, putting away or putting to death &s;everal others after her.</P>
<P N="2">2. In de&s;troying the Abbeys and Mona&s;teries; which, however we are pleas'd with the matter who are Prote&s;tants, in him that was a Papi&s;t could be nothing but a Sacrilegious Robbing the Church, alienating the Charity of the Dead, and Robbing other Men of their Due.</P>
<P N="3">3. In his Cruelty and Thir&s;t of Blood; who at the &s;ame time put to death Prote&s;tants for denying the Real Pre&s;ence, and Papi&s;ts for denying to acknowledge his immediate Su|premacy.</P>
<P>If King <HI>Henry</HI> the Eighth lop'd off the Branches of Pope|ry, King <HI>Edward</HI> the Sixth laid the Ax to the Root of it; he gave it the Mortal Wound, and it died under his hand: And 'tis the Glory of our Reformation, that God, who had

<P>What that Prince would have been, if he had liv'd to ha' &s;hown him&s;elf in the World, no body can tell; but he died early enough to prevent all po&s;&s;ible Scandal upon his Mo|rals, and liv'd long enough to &s;how more Sincerity, and more Zeal to Religion, than any Prince that ever &s;at upon the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Throne, or any other Throne in the World.</P>
<P>The peculiar Quality of the Royal Religion we are upon, is expre&s;s'd very much in the Book we are now in Debate about.</P>
<P>And what is the Title of this Book? <HI>A Book of Prayers.</HI> When Kings Pray, it may well be put in a Book. And 'tis remarkable to all the World, that in all our Li&s;t of Kings, from the Conque&s;t to King <HI>William,</HI> there is not one word of Prayer recorded, no, not in the mo&s;t Flattering, Ful&s;om Hi&s;tories of their Lives, except of King <HI>Edward</HI> the Sixth and King <HI>William.</HI></P>
<P>I omit <HI>Eikon Ba&s;ilik&eacute;,</HI> and the Martyrdom of King <HI>Charles</HI> the Fir&s;t in this ca&s;e, becau&s;e one is liable to Exception; and the other, a Ca&s;e without Example, which does not reach our Ca&s;e.</P>
<P>I come now to the Credit of the Book we are upon; for, with tho&s;e People who are not willing to have this Book genuine, and who have a&s;&s;aulted it with Banter and Ridi|cule, who will have King <HI>William</HI> have no Religion, becau&s;e they have little them&s;elves, or becau&s;e he did not plea&s;e them; after they have done with their incoherent Rail|lery, and find it in&s;ufficient, then they a&s;&s;ault the Book it &s;elf.</P>

<P>But the pre&s;ent Subject of our Di&s;cour&s;e, his late Glorious Maje&s;ty, at his Death, gave Convincing Proofs, that he felt the Compo&s;ure of a Calm Con&s;cience; and I know no great|ter Te&s;timony of a Sincerity in Religion.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="26">
As to his Dying in the Church of <HI>England,</HI> 'tis plain he Died in the Communion of that Church, in that the Ble&s;|&s;ed Sacrament was Admini&s;tred to him, by the Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> not many Hours before his Death; and which he Receiv'd with extraordinary Marks of Devo|tion.</P>
<P>As to his An&s;wer given to the Que&s;tion, which he has been &s;o much reproached for, he an&s;wer'd, He Died a Chri|&s;tian, and in Communion with the Reform'd Prote&s;tant Church, according to that Glorious Principle of Charity, which his Maje&s;ty always retain'd for all Societies of Sin|cere Chri&s;tians, and which, as far as in him lay, he always Promoted and Encourag'd, both by his Commands and his Royal Example.</P>
<P>May the exceeding Candor of his Temper, the Exten&s;ive|ne&s;s of his Charity; and the Healing Principle, which on all occa&s;ions appear'd in him, be the Pattern for this whole Nation to Imitate.</P>
<P>May all Succeeding Princes, who &s;hall &s;it on the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Throne, Acknowledge, Serve, and Pray to their Great So|vereign Maker like him; let him be &s;o far their Pattern, let them &s;how the King and the Chri&s;tian like him.</P>
<P>And whenever this Nation is ble&s;t again with a Praying and a Fighting Monarch; may they treat him better, be|tray him le&s;s, and love him more; lea&s;t Heaven &s;erve them then, as he has done now, and take him from them when they have mo&s;t need of him.</P>
