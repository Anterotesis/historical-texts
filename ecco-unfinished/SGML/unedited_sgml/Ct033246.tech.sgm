<HEAD>A Faithful
NARRATIVE, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>_SORRY am I&mdash;yea very
grievous it is unto me, that
the unchri&s;tian Treatment I
have lately undergone, com|pelleth
me to complain of that
Malevolence which me&s;eemeth
hath &s;oured the Milk of human Kindne&s;s,
and engendered Rancour and Envy in the
Room of Peace and brotherly Affection.&mdash;
An Office of Humanity in which I was late|ly
concerned, hath been &s;o cruelly, not to
call it heatheni&s;hly mi&s;repre&s;ented to my
Prejudice, that I were more in&s;en&s;ible than
the Bea&s;ts that peri&s;h, could I &s;it tamely
under the Spout of Slander, without &s;eeking
to ju&s;tify the Uprightne&s;s of my Intention in
the Face of God and Man. It having been
<PB N="4" REF="3">
indu&s;triou&s;ly whi&s;pered about, that I was
aiding and abetting in a Confederacy again&s;t
the Peace and Con&s;cience of my Neighbour
<HI>Habbakkuk Hilding,</HI> Ju&s;tice, Chapman and
Dealer, whereby the Brain of the &s;aid
<HI>Hilding</HI> was mi&s;erably di&s;tempered, &s;o as to
render him incapable of carrying on his
Trade, or providing for his Wife and nu|merous
Family; I, in Ju&s;tice to my own
Character, as well as to the Intent that tho&s;e
Per&s;ons who were guilty of this ba&s;e and
enormous Crime, may be properly &s;tigma|tized
and puni&s;hed, for their Barbarity.&mdash;I
&s;ay, being moved by the&s;e Con&s;iderations,
I will now, with the utmo&s;t Sincerity and
Regard to Truth, narrate the Particulars of
this heinous Tran&s;action, that the Publick
may &s;ee whether I have not acted as became
an hone&s;t Man, a good Neighbour, and
zealous Chri&s;tian.&mdash;</P>
<P>Fir&s;t then, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to premi&s;e
that I have for &s;ome Time pa&s;t, lived on
the Foot of friendly Intercour&s;e with the
above mentioned <HI>Hilding,</HI> being thereunto
moved by the Report of divers &s;ub&s;tantial
and creditable Hou&s;ekeepers in the Neigh|bourhood,
who a&s;&s;ured me that he had
quitted all the vicious and abandoned Cour&s;es
of his former Life, and now behaved in
every re&s;pect, like a &s;ober Subject and vigi|lant
Magi&s;trate; and although during the
Term of our Acquaintance, I have known
<PB N="5" REF="4">
him break out into &s;undry Irregularities both
in Life and Conver&s;ation, I cannot help
owning that he was upon the whole, more
calm and moderate than one could well ex|pect
of a Per&s;on &s;o long accu&s;tomed to
Riot, Outrage and all manner of Profligacy.
His latter Exce&s;&s;es I charitably imputed to a
&s;mall Re&s;idue of the old Leaven working
with the Infirmities of old Age; and with
regard to &s;ome temporary Paroxi&s;ms of De|lirium
to which he was &s;ubject, I was given
to under&s;tand that they proceeded from a
di&s;ordered Imagination, originally produced
by &s;ome unlucky overthrows he had &s;u&s;tain'd
in the Warfare of an Author.</P>
<P>It was to this Cau&s;e, I a&s;cribed divers ex|travagancies
which I of late ob&s;erved in his
private Deportment: Such as mixing To|bacco
with his Beer, and in&s;i&s;ting upon our
pledging him in that unpalatable Compo&s;i|tion;
&s;wearing with horrid Imprecations,
that if we refu&s;ed to do him Ju&s;tice, we
&s;hould be forthwith committed to <HI>Bridewell:</HI>
He was al&s;o &s;eized with the unaccountable
Whim of &s;moaking his Pipe at his po&s;terior
Chimney, of leaking in his favourite Con|&s;table's
Hat, and one Night at the Club,
where he always u&s;ed to fabricate our Punch,
in&s;tead of Sugar he di&s;&s;olved a large Quan|tity
of purging Salts. When we complained
of the Sophi&s;tication he &s;wore that what he
had done was for the Pre&s;ervation of Health,
<PB N="6" REF="5">
on the Authority of one Dr. <HI>Thump&s;cull,</HI>
whom he repre&s;ented as the greate&s;t Phy&s;i|cian
upon Earth, who had at length di&s;co|vered
the univer&s;al Catholicon, which was
no other than <HI>Acton</HI>-Water impregnated
with the&s;e Salts. Sometimes he would &s;ink
into a State of profound mu&s;ing, during
which he would neither reply to our Inter|rogations,
nor drink off his Gla&s;s, which
formerly he never u&s;ed to neglect; but &s;hift
his Chew from one Cheek to another, and
twi&s;t his Mouth into various Contor&s;ions
without Intermi&s;&s;ion; then he would, all of
a &s;udden, &s;nap his Fingers, pronounce &s;ome
incoherent Cur&s;e, and tilting him&s;elf upon
one Hip, emit a very audible Explo&s;ion;
which indeed every Member had the Privi|lege
of doing; in as much as the Club is
&s;tiled the <HI>Free</HI> and <HI>Ea&s;y.</HI></P>
<P>&startq;A&s;&s;uredly, (&s;aid I to my&s;elf) the&s;e
Symptoms indicate a total Subver&s;ion of
Intellect; for, they have continued for
&s;everal Days &s;ucce&s;&s;ively, whereas, his for|mer
Fits &s;eldom la&s;ted longer than a few
Hours. I mu&s;t ob&s;erve his Conduct
more narrowly, before I venture to de|clare
my&s;elf, le&s;t I &s;hould incur the
Penalty of the Law for Defamation; and
&s;o &s;oon as I &s;hall be convinced that he is
in reality <HI>non compos,</HI> perform the Duties
of my own Con&s;cience, in warning the
re&s;t of his Friends and Relations, &s;o as
<PB N="7" REF="6">
that he may be properly re&s;trained from
doing Mi&s;chief.&endq;&mdash;Actuated by the&s;e
Chri&s;tian Con&s;iderations, and none other,
I redoubled my Vi&s;its to his Hou&s;e, and in
one of the&s;e, &s;eeing two Per&s;ons enter, with
very important Countenances, I retired to
another Apartment on the Suppo&s;ition that
they were come upon Bu&s;ine&s;s; and when
they withdrew, returned to the Room they
had left, where I found Mr. <HI>Hilding</HI> foam|ing
at the Mouth with a very particular
Wildne&s;s in his Looks, and other Marks of
extreme Agitation, which was the more re|markable
as he had been perfectly &s;ober and
&s;edate when I quitted the Room.</P>
<P>I could not help &s;u&s;pecting that this vio|lent
Emotion was the Effect of what had
happened between him and tho&s;e Strangers;
and even began to be apprehen&s;ive that they
had been tampering with him on the Score
of Religion, according to the Practice of
&s;ome <HI>Roman</HI> Catholick Prie&s;ts, who lie in
wait for tho&s;e Symptoms of a decayed Un|der&s;tanding,
in order to make Converts to
their damnable Communion; for, my poor
Neighbour raved exceedingly about St. <HI>Paul</HI>
and the <HI>Apocalyp&s;e;</HI> and with many Oaths
pronounced the reproachful Terms of Rogue,
Ra&s;cal, Hypocrite, Goo&s;e, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which I &s;up|po&s;e
were be&s;towed upon the &s;aid Vi&s;itants.
He who &s;eemed to be the principal Figure,
was a long, lean, lank, mi&s;hapen Spectre,
<PB N="8" REF="7">
with an aukward, &s;hambling, Goo&s;e-like
Gait, a Neck of prodigious Exten&s;ion, and
a mo&s;t &s;imple Phy&s;iognomy, which at that
Time I really took to be the Re&s;ult of
con&s;ummate Di&s;&s;imulation. In a Word, I
dreaded &s;ome Je&s;uitical Con&s;piracy, and re|&s;olved
to watch them more narrowly in their
future Vi&s;itations.</P>
<P>I accordingly hinted my Su&s;picions to
Mrs. <HI>Hilding,</HI> who thanked me for my
kind Concern, and actually gave me Notice
the very next Day, that the &s;ame Per&s;ons
were returned: I then, for my own Ju&s;tifi|cation,
engaged two of my Neighbours to
accompany and a&s;&s;i&s;t me in this charitable
Work, and repairing to my Friend <HI>Hab|bakkuk</HI>'s
Hou&s;e, we were privately intro|duced
into an Apartment where we could
overhear the Conver&s;ation that pa&s;&s;ed be|tween
him and his Gue&s;ts. The fir&s;t Voice
we heard was that of his Wor&s;hip, who in
a very vehement Tone &s;poke to the follow|ing
Purpo&s;e. &startq;Blood and Thunder! Sir
<HI>Go&s;ling,</HI> don't tell me of your Favours;
I am &s;ure I have purcha&s;ed them at a
damned dear Price. Zounds! I have
been hooted at, beat and battered, lo&s;t
my Sen&s;es, my Teeth and Reputation in
your Service; and the Devil confound me
if I have the lea&s;t Inclination to reim|bark
at the&s;e Years, in &s;uch a de&s;perate
Quarrel.&endq; The other having &s;olemnly re|buked
<PB N="9" REF="8">
him for his profane Swearing, as a
Practice altogether indecent and of evil Ex|ample
in a Magi&s;trate; de&s;ired him to recol|lect
what he owed, in point of Gratitude,
to the Man who had re&s;cued him from the
Contempt of the World, and the Horrors of
Indigence, from which all his Talents could
not defend him. &startq;Have not I (&s;aid the
Remon&s;trant) relieved you in your Ne|ce&s;&s;ities,
been the Bawd to your Perform|ances;
and, in De&s;pite of all Decorum,
erected you into a Judge over your Fel|lows;
and now that I am in&s;ulted in
publick, do you refu&s;e to &s;tand forth in
my Behalf?&endq; <HI>Habbakkuk,</HI> irritated by
the&s;e Upbraidings, replied in a furious Accent,
&startq;Damme, Sir, you mu&s;t give me leave to
act the Remembrancer in my Turn. Pray,
am not I the Per&s;on who, in Defiance to
his own Con&s;cience, hath been an humble
and a&s;&s;iduous Mini&s;ter to your Vanity and
Self-conceit? Have I not been your Bully
in private Conver&s;ations, repre&s;enting you
as a mighty Orator, profound State&s;man,
immen&s;e Scholar, Critick and Wit? Have
I not even pro&s;tituted my own Judgment
and Character &s;o far as to celebrate you for
the&s;e Talents in the Works I have pub|li&s;hed?
Have not I played the Part of
your Zany or Jack-Pudding in weekly
Lucubrations again&s;t the <HI>Jacobites,</HI> until
the mo&s;t zealous Whig was &s;ick of my
<PB N="10" REF="9">
Buffoonery, and totally di&s;carded me and
mine A&s;s? I have not only buttered you,
Sir <HI>Go&s;ling,</HI> but by G&mdash;d, I have de|&s;cended
&s;o low as to write Panegyrick
upon the mo&s;t contemptible of tho&s;e
who had &s;cribbled in your Prai&s;e; and
what is my Recompen&s;e for all this Sa|crifice?
Why truly, you have put me
in a Way of getting Bread when I have
no longer Teeth to eat it. But granting,
as you ob&s;erve, my Talents could &s;carce
keep me from &s;tarving in my Youth,
when all my Faculties were in Perfection,
what a Figure &s;hould I now cut, were I
to declare War again&s;t Antagoni&s;ts who
are allowed to have Health, Strength, and
Dexterity on their Side? Have you for|got
what a &s;curvy Champion I proved in
the Character of <HI>Hercules Vinegar,</HI> when
I was detected in playing Booty and hi&s;&s;ed
off the Stage? Don't you &s;till perceive in
my Countenance Marks of repeated Dam|nation?
And will you per&s;i&s;t in de&s;iring
me to expo&s;e my&s;elf to fre&s;h Dangers and
Di&s;grace by a&s;&s;uming the Title of <HI>Cen&s;or</HI>
of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> to which I have ju&s;t as
good a Claim as the under Turn-key of
<HI>Bridewell</HI> has to the Government of <HI>Gib|raltar?</HI>
'Sdeath! Sir <HI>Go&s;ling,</HI> it but ill
becomes me to attack tho&s;e who really are
the Inhabitants of <HI>Grub&s;treet?</HI>&mdash;Me, who
at many different Periods of my Life have
<PB N="11" REF="10">
had no Habitation at all; who was indeed
literally the Inhabitant of the fir&s;t Street
that pre&s;ented me with a dry Bulk, or
convenient Penthou&s;e for the Night's
Lodging; who would have rejoiced at
being admitted into any Garret in <HI>Grub|&s;treet,</HI>
or Cellar in <HI>Thieving-Lane,</HI> where
I could have enjoyed the Benefits of a
clean Straw-Couch, and a Cover over
my Head; who have been fain to hire
my&s;elf as Author to a Puppet-&s;hew Man;
and even to blow the Trumpet in Quality
of Herald to a Collection of wild Bea&s;ts
at <HI>Bartholomew</HI> Fair, rather than per|&s;evere
in &s;uffering the incredible Fa|tigue,
continual Apprehen&s;ion, and un|numbered
Drubbings annexed to the
Employment of a Bawdy-hou&s;e Bully,
which I exerci&s;ed for the Space of two
whole Years: hath not the Hor&s;e-laugh
of the Public been turned again&s;t me, by
almo&s;t every Per&s;on whom I have attemp|ted
to ridicule? witne&s;s that facetious Ra&s;|cal
who even di&s;puted my Exi&s;tence, and
actually proved me defunct, while his
Cu&s;tomers were treated with Tea at my
Expence. With what Face then can I
take the Field again&s;t Antagoni&s;ts whom
you in your Con&s;cience know and have
often owned to be Soldiers of Courage and
Proof, and who knew perfectly well
<PB N="12" REF="11">
how to manage tho&s;e Batteries of Ridicule
again&s;t me? An&s;wer me that Sir <HI>Go&s;ling.</HI>&endq;</P>
<P>I was much plea&s;ed and comforted at
hearing this Expo&s;tulation, which was not
only &s;en&s;ible and di&s;creet, but moreover
fraught with a becoming Mode&s;ty, which I
had never before marked in the Conver&s;a|tion
of my poor Friend: For, he was al|ways
ob&s;erved to have that Failing of low
Minds, which is &s;hewn by Humility and
Fawning in the Day of Trouble; and by
Arrogance and over-weening Conceit in his
better Fortune&mdash;But tho&s;e evil Coun&s;ellors
were not thus to be baffled in their perni|cious
De&s;ign&mdash;Sir <HI>Go&s;ling</HI> &s;till proceeded in
his Incentives, affirming that <HI>Habbakkuk</HI>
would, in the War which he had projected,
have divers con&s;iderable Advantages over his
Adver&s;aries, in as much as he was already ren|dered
callous and in&s;en&s;ible, by the numberle&s;s
Di&s;graces he had undergone; con&s;equently
ca&s;e-hardened again&s;t the Weapons of the
Foe, who might perhaps &s;u&s;tain &s;ome acci|dental
Stroke in the Cour&s;e of the Cam|paign;
while he could not po&s;&s;ibly &s;uffer
the lea&s;t Diminution in point of Glory and
Importance; &s;o happily was he placed be|low
the Level of Ridicule or Cen&s;ure.
&startq;Let me illu&s;trate this A&s;&s;ertion (&s;aid he)
with the Example of your Friend and
quondam Companion <HI>Buckhor&s;e</HI> the Shoe-cleaner
and Brui&s;er, who&s;e Character and
<PB N="13" REF="12">
Situation bears a &s;trong Analogy with
your own. Would not that indefatigable
Veteran, who hath been pummelled out
of all the Sen&s;ations, and indeed almo&s;t out
of the Appearance of human Nature,
have palpably the be&s;t of the Match in
engaging with an Hero of &s;uperior Sen&s;i|bility
and Fame? Surely, yes&mdash;becau&s;e
there is &s;omething which by the Chance
of Battle he might gain, and nothing
which by being defeated, he could lo&s;e&mdash;
all that I require of you, is to march
forth in Proce&s;&s;ion, like a &s;turdy Prize-fighter,
who with Sword in Hand and a
Number of Patches on his Skull, the
Marks of former Prowe&s;s, challenges his
rival Warriors to &s;ingle Combat&mdash;Sound
the Trumpet of Defiance again&s;t all tho&s;e
Champions who are either your Foes or
mine: Whatever Talents they may have,
or what&s;oever may have been their Suc|ce&s;s;
treat them all as Cowards, A&s;&s;es,
Grubs and Vermin; but let loo&s;e the
chief Torrent of your Gall again&s;t that
Ra&s;cal <HI>Peregrine Pickle,</HI> who hath
brought us both to Ridicule and Shame&mdash;if
you &s;hould chance to &s;ee him in your
March, take Po&s;t in the next Kennel,
and be&s;patter him with Dirt; that is
an Exerci&s;e in which I am &s;ure he is
not your Equal. Should he decline the
Encounter, pur&s;ue him with Abu&s;e&mdash;
<PB N="14" REF="13">
your blind Brother will join the Cry, and
ring the Changes upon the Words <HI>mean,
low, &s;tupid, Scandal</HI> and <HI>Scurrility.</HI>&endq;</P>
<P>Here he was interrupted by the unfortu|nate
<HI>Habbakkuk,</HI> who exclaimed in a mo&s;t
outragious Strain. &startq;Death and the Devil
and Damnation! d' ye want to make me
a Laughing-&s;tock to the lowe&s;t of the
Rabble&mdash;does not all the World know
that <HI>Habbakkuk Hilding</HI> was never heard
of as an Author, until he opened an
Office for the Sale of Scurrility and per|&s;onal
Abu&s;e, which was known by the
Name of <HI>Hilding</HI>'s Scandal Shop, and be|came
as notorious as the Oratory of <HI>Clare-Market?</HI>&mdash;have
you forgot what a Stab
the Liberty of the Pre&s;s received, on ac|count
of my Pre&s;umption, and the In&s;o|lence
of certain Per&s;ons? Sir <HI>Go&s;ling,</HI> d-mn
my Blood, we know one another.&endq;&mdash;In
this Place he &s;uffered another Interruption,
by the Knight, who with &s;ome Expre&s;&s;ions
of kind Concern, took Notice that <HI>Hab|bakkuk</HI>'s
Countenance was changed, that
his Eyes &s;eemed hollow, and one Side of his
Mouth convul&s;ed; and begged he would take
a few Drops of a &s;alutary Elixir, which he (Sir
<HI>Go&s;ling</HI>) always carried in his Pocket for
his own U&s;e, becau&s;e he was &s;ubject to the
&s;ame Irregularity of Spirits.&mdash;I no &s;ooner
heard this Offer made, then I applied one
Eye to a &s;mall Hole in the Partition, and
<PB N="15" REF="14">
&s;aw the &s;aid Sir <HI>Go&s;ling</HI> pour a Quantity of
that pernicious Drug into a Gla&s;s of Water,
and make a Tender of it to the unhappy Pa|tient,
who with much Reluctance &s;wal|lowed
the Do&s;e, in con&s;equence of the re|peated
Entreaties and Blandi&s;hments of the
two Strangers; and they &s;eeing their Train
take Effect, muttered &s;omething in a low
Voice, with many &s;trange Ge&s;ticulations,
which I was equally a&s;toni&s;hed and afraid
to behold.</P>
<P>In a few Minutes the Effect of this dia|bolical
Philtre was but too evident&mdash;the
mi&s;erable Patient &s;eemed to undergo a mo|mentary
Slumber, from which he &s;tarted in
a violent Bur&s;t of Laughter: Then he began
to &s;ing with great Vociferation&mdash;ki&s;&s;ed his
Vi&s;itants, &s;wore they had in&s;pired him with
the Spirit of <HI>Alexander;</HI> that he would fight
Sir <HI>Go&s;ling</HI>'s Quarrels, until he &s;hould have
put all his Enemies under his Feet. Terri|fied
at the&s;e &s;udden and amazing Symptoms
of Frenzy and Delu&s;ion, I poured forth an
Ejaculation to Heaven that I might be pre|&s;erved
from the Power of &s;uch infernal Sor|cery,
and retired without Lo&s;s of Time to
my own Hou&s;e, being followed by my two
Friends, who as yet did not know the true
Source of my Fears&mdash;I am not one of
tho&s;e incredulous People who will not be|lieve
there are Spells to take the Rea&s;on
Pri&s;oner; therefore I kept within Doors,
<PB N="16" REF="15">
praying for my unhappy Friend, and wait|ing
to &s;ee the I&s;&s;ue of tho&s;e damnable Arts
that were practi&s;ed upon him&mdash;when lo!
next Morning, I had Occa&s;ion to ob&s;erve
the Power of Infatuation in its full Extent.</P>
<P>About eleven o'Clock, <HI>Hilding</HI>'s Door was
be&s;et with a &s;trange Crew of both Sexes,
who I at fir&s;t imagined, were a&s;&s;embled as
u&s;ual in the Characters of Plaintiff and De|fendant;
but I was &s;oon undeceived, by
venturing to go out, and taking my Station
among the Spectators that &s;tood at &s;ome
Di&s;tance from the Skirts of this Mob. The
fir&s;t Per&s;on of Con&s;equence that appeared at
the Door was his own Brother, who, as
well as <HI>Habbakkuk,</HI> is Proprietor of a twelve
penny Office, and commonly di&s;tingui&s;hed
by the Title of the blind Mu&s;ter-Ma&s;ter
General of the Tag, Rag and Bob-tail.
Sure I am, he acted in that Capacity, on
this Occa&s;ion, giving Directions to an Under|&s;trapper
to range the whole Troop into diffe|rent
Divi&s;ions, and appoint a Leader to each.
The&s;e Di&s;po&s;itions being made, every Indivi|dual
was regaled with a large Gla&s;s of Geneva,
and then <HI>Habbakkuk</HI> appearing in Per&s;on,
was &s;aluted with three Chears, and the Ac|clamation
of &startq;Long live the invincible Sir
<HI>Alexander Drawcan&s;ir.</HI>&endq;&mdash;I was not a
little &s;urprized to hear my unhappy Neigh|bour
dubbed with a Title prefixed to an In|ver&s;ion
of my own Name&mdash;but this was
<PB N="17" REF="16">
doubtle&s;s the Work of his In&s;tigators, who
regarded me with an evil Eye, becau&s;e they
probably knew I had cautioned him again&s;t
their enormous Practices.</P>
<P>They had by this Time reduced him to
a deplorable Object&mdash;his whole Face and
upper Garment were bedaubed with Snuff,
his Mouth was crammed with Tobacco, the
Tincture of which ran down his Beard in
divers yellow Streams: His Eyes &s;eemed to
reel, and he &s;taggered into the Street like
an intoxicated Tinker, exclaiming in a fran|tic
Strain, &startq;Damn them for Mi&s;creants! I'll
cut and carve and carbonado the whole
Race&mdash;bring me my <HI>Bucephalus,</HI> ye
Slaves.&endq;&mdash;So totally was the Judgment of
this poor Wretch perverted, that he mount|ed
a Jack-A&s;s which they had prepared for
the Purpo&s;e, in the full Per&s;ua&s;ion, that it
was the identical Steed of <HI>Alexander</HI> the
<HI>Great:</HI> But, in nothing was his Frenzy
more con&s;picuous than in his Behaviour,
while he rode round the Ranks to review
his Forces, with a curtailed Mop&s;tick, by
way of leading Staff, in his Hand, he made
Obei&s;ance to his blind Brother, as to the
Author of the Iliad; &s;hook Hands with a
Con&s;table, calling him by the Name of
<HI>Ari&s;totle;</HI> imagined he &s;aw <HI>Pindar</HI> in the
Per&s;on of a Shoe-Black, and <HI>Horace</HI> repre|&s;ented
by a Thief-Taker: By the &s;ame In|fatuation
<PB N="18" REF="17">
he beheld the re&s;t of the Ancients
in his Army, per&s;onated by Vagabonds,
Pick-pockets, and Ballad-&s;ingers, whom his
Brother had enli&s;ted into the Service; and
riding up to a draggle-tailed Bunter, who had
lo&s;t her No&s;e in the Exerci&s;e of her Occupa|tion,
he addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to her by the Appel|lation
of the adorable <HI>Amelia,</HI> &s;wore by all the
Gods &s;he was the Pattern of all earthly Beauty
and Perfection; and that he had exhau&s;ted
his whole Fancy in celebrating her Name&mdash;To
this Compliment &s;he an&s;wered in a &s;nuff|ling
Tone, &startq;Ju&s;tice, you're a comical Bitch;
I wi&s;h you would treat me with a Dram
this cold Morning,&endq; and before he could
reply, he was acco&s;ted by a &s;habby Fellow
dre&s;&s;ed in a Soldier's old Coat, who in a
whimpering Accent, &s;econded the Lady's
Reque&s;t, giving his Wor&s;hip to under&s;tand
that the divine <HI>Amelia</HI> had for three Days
ta&s;ted nothing &s;tronger than &s;ome brown
Caudle of his own making. In con&s;equence
of this Remon&s;trance, <HI>Habbakkuk</HI> pre&s;ented
him with an old Iron Tobacco-Box, &s;ay|ing,
&startq;Well, Mr. <HI>Booth,</HI> here is &s;omething
you may pledge in her Behalf at the next
Gin-&s;hop.&endq;&mdash;He then put him&s;elf at
their Head, and ordered the whole Caval|cade
to march.</P>
<P>Accordingly they proceeded down <HI>Ca|therine-&s;treet</HI>
to the <HI>Strand,</HI> in a mo&s;t tu|multuous
<PB N="19" REF="18">
Manner, bellowing Defiance to all
who &s;hould pre&s;ume to oppo&s;e them; their
Commander leading the Van upon A&s;s|back,
and his Brother bringing up the Rear,
under the Guidance of one who called him|&s;elf
<HI>Jones,</HI> and pretended to be a Gentle|man;
though he was in reality no other
than a Player's Ba&s;tard, and had been for|merly
tran&s;ported under another Name&mdash;
His Right-Hand Man was one <HI>Partridge,</HI> a
notorious Felon and Impo&s;tor; and on his
Left &s;talked a &s;trange uncouth Figure with
a long Beard, whom the &s;aid <HI>Jones</HI> &s;tiled
the Philo&s;opher of the Hill; but, he after|wards
proved to be a Sheep-&s;tealer in Di&s;|gui&s;e&mdash;as
for <HI>Amelia</HI> and her beloved <HI>Booth,</HI>
they marched Hand in Hand immediately
behind the General; the Wi$e brandi&s;hing
a Broom&s;tick, and the Hu&s;band weilding a
Di&s;taff, with a Gly&s;ter-pipe fixed to his
Button-Holes&mdash;He &s;uffered a great many fu|rious
Looks from a termagant Oy&s;ter-Wench
called <HI>Matthews,</HI> who walked at a little Di|&s;tance
from this fond Couple, and frequently
flouri&s;hed her Knife at them, with all the
Marks of Jealou&s;y and De&s;pair.</P>
<P>In this Manner they continued their March
without Oppo&s;ition, to the Terror of his
Maje&s;ty's peaceable Subjects; and made an
Halt on the Banks of the Kennel that wa|ters
the <HI>New Church</HI> in the <HI>Strand</HI>&mdash;here
<PB N="20" REF="19">
they &s;topped with a View to &s;end off De|tachments
to different Quarters of the Town,
when all of a &s;udden the above-mentioned
<HI>Mattkews,</HI> &s;eeing a decent Gentlewoman cro&s;|&s;ing
the Street, ran up to <HI>Habbakkuk</HI> with vio|lent
Emotion, crying, &startq;D&mdash;n my Eyes!
Ju&s;tice, now is the Time to &s;tand by me,
for there's the B&mdash;ch Mi&s;s <HI>Williams,</HI>
Waiting-Maid to Madam <HI>Random,</HI> com|ing
for a Warrant to have me nabbed for
nimming her Gown and Capuchin.&endq;&mdash;
At the &s;ame In&s;tant, <HI>Partridge</HI> having de|&s;cried
a Journeyman Barber, with a remark|ably
long Chin, pa&s;&s;ing by <HI>Somer&s;et-Hou&s;e,</HI>
in Conver&s;ation with another Man, roared
out with uncommon Symptoms of Affright,
&startq;Blood! We &s;hall all be grabbed, don't

his Peeter and Queer <HI>Jo&s;eph</HI>&mdash;'tis
Time to &s;habb off, d&mdash;n my Liver.&endq; With
the&s;e Words he betook him&s;elf to his Heels,
and fled with great Expedition, being fol|lowed
by the <HI>p&s;eudo Jones</HI> and <HI>Man of the
Hill,</HI> who though they did not rightly con|ceive
his Meaning, knew them&s;elves too
well to hazard any Explanation with the
<PB N="21" REF="20">
Officers of Ju&s;tice&mdash;This Defection pro|duced
an univer&s;al Pannick among the Sol|diers
and even Officers of the &s;econd Line:
in&s;omuch that a general Rout en&s;ued, and
the blind Chieftain was overthrown by
<HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> in his Retreat.</P>
<P><HI>Habbakkuk</HI> &s;eeing this Di&s;order in his
Troops, clapped Spurs to his A&s;s and pur|&s;ued
the Fugitives, cur&s;ing them for their
Cowardice, and exhorting them to return;
but they &s;oon vani&s;hed notwith&s;tanding his
Remon&s;trances, and when he wheeled about
to encourage the re&s;t to per&s;evere in their
Duty, the greate&s;t Part of them were al|ready
di&s;per&s;ed, and his chief Friends and
Favourites in the Cu&s;tody of a Con&s;table,
who at my Solicitation had been detached
by Ju&s;tice <HI>Le Gard,</HI> to apprehend the Ring|leaders
of &s;uch a Riot again&s;t the Laws of
the Land, and the Peace of his Maje&s;ty's
loyal Subjects.&mdash;This Event, in&s;tead of calm|ing,
rather inflamed the Delirium of the
unfortunate <HI>Hilding,</HI> who uttered many
frantic Imprecations again&s;t the Cowards
who had betrayed him, &s;wore, in Imitation
of his Predece&s;&s;or and Name&s;ake, that he
would pur&s;ue his Conque&s;ts in his own Per|&s;on,
then couching his Mop&s;tick, with a
&s;trange and ludicrous Di&s;tortion of Feature,
applied his Heels to the Sides of the &s;up|po&s;ed
<HI>Bucephalus,</HI> with Intent to charge his
<PB N="22" REF="21">
Opponents, whom, it &s;eems, he mi&s;took for
one <HI>Peregrine Pickle</HI> and his A&s;&s;ociates, in
as much as he addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to Mr. Con|&s;table
as to the &s;aid <HI>Pickle,</HI> exclaiming,</P>
<P>&startq;I know thee well, a Blood thou art,&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Lord <HI>Pickle,</HI> So am I,&endq;&mdash;With the&s;e
Words he would have a&s;&s;aulted the Peace
Officer, had not my&s;elf and &s;everal of his
Neighbours laid hold on him, and carried him
to his own Hou&s;e, where by the Advice of
an able Phy&s;ician, he was immediately
blooded, bli&s;tered and purged.</P>
<P>But his Frenzy &s;till continues, and the
Doctor &s;eems to de&s;pair of his Recovery.
For tho' by dint of the Evacuations he hath
undergone, the Rage of his Frenzy is in
&s;ome Mea&s;ure abated, he &s;till continues de|prived
of his Sen&s;es, and is between whiles
&s;eized with &s;hocking Fits of Horror and De|&s;pair,
during which he is often heard to cry,
&mdash;&startq;Save me from that Ruffian <HI>Pipes!</HI> bind
him over; he &s;hakes his Cudgel at me.&mdash;What,
no Evidence for Love or Money!
Ha! <HI>Polypheme</HI> approaches, with his <HI>Cyclo|pian</HI>
Eye! tie me under the Belly of a Ram.&mdash;I
cry you Mercy, a <HI>Mi&s;nomer. Trun|nion</HI>
is the Man.&mdash;Spare me, &s;pare me, good
Commodore! I own I have wronged you,
as well as your Nephew <HI>Peregrine,</HI> and his
Cou&s;in <HI>Random.</HI>&mdash;I have robb'd them both,
and then rai&s;ed a fal&s;e Report again&s;t them.
<PB N="23" REF="22">
&mdash;But my poor Con&s;cience &s;uffers for all.&mdash;
I have damned my&s;elf for the Sake of that
mi&s;creant <HI>Scrag.</HI> O that I could &s;ee him
&s;cragged in good Earne&s;t!&mdash;Mercy! Mer|cy!
I will find Bail.&mdash;Gentlemen, I plead
guilty.&mdash;Do'nt pickle me.&mdash;I &s;han't quit
Co&s;t.&mdash;I am poor Carrion.&mdash;Don't you
perceive, I &s;tink of Mortality.&endq; Such is the
pre&s;ent Situation of this wretched Man. As
for his Aiders and Abettors, they were forth|with
committed to the Hou&s;e of Correction;
and what is remarkable, <HI>Amelia</HI> and <HI>Booth,</HI>
at the very fir&s;t, performed the Operation of
Milldolling, like Per&s;ons well &s;killed and
long experienced in that &s;alubrious Ex|erci&s;e.</P>
<P>This being a fair and impartial Account
of the whole Tran&s;action, I leave the World
to judge whether I have been to blame in
my Conduct towards the &s;aid <HI>Hilding,</HI> which
was purely the Re&s;ult of Humanity and
Compa&s;&s;ion; or whether the Wrath of God
and Man will not, in all probability, pur&s;ue
the infamous Authors of his Mi&s;hap, who
not contented with the Mi&s;ery they have al|ready
entailed upon him, have trumped up
a fal&s;e and &s;candalous Account of certain
Victories which they pretend he obtained in
the above narrated Expedition; tho' they
took care to con&s;ult their own Safety, by
keeping them&s;elves without the Reach of
<PB N="24" REF="23">
that Tumult in which they had involv'd their
innocent Friend: But, doubtle&s;s, their De|&s;ign
is to impo&s;e upon that vain Lunatick,
with feigned Reports of his own Prowe&s;s,
that he may be incited to take the Field
again, and become &s;ub&s;ervient to their &s;ordid
and unchri&s;tian Views of Intere&s;t and Re|venge.</P>
<P>That the Father of Mercy would take
Pity on his deplorable Condition, and deliver
him, and all of us, from their perfidious Arts
and infernal Snares, is the fervent Prayer of
his unfeigned Wellwi&s;her,</P>
