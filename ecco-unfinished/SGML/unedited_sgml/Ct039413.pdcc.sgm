<P>THE Author begs Leave to premi&s;e, that in this E&s;&s;ay, he has retained &s;ome few of the ob&s;olete Words of <HI>Spen&s;er,</HI> and adopted the Sim|plicity of the Diction in the ludicrous Ca&s;t, at the End of mo&s;t of the Stanzas, to give it more the Air of that great Original.&mdash;He thinks he need not make any Apology for the Stile and Mea&s;ure of the Ver&s;e, they being generally, if not univer|&s;ally allowed, the mo&s;t &s;uitable for Works of this Kind. &mdash; In order to make it more intelligible, at the Foot of each Page, is given an Explanation of the ob&s;olete Words, as they occur. &mdash; As to the

modern Terms of the Ladies Dre&s;s, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> (which per|haps may be thought by &s;ome, to require as much Explanation as the ob&s;olete Ones) he pre&s;umes as they are pretty well known among the Ladies and Beau Monde, he may be excu&s;ed a Di&s;cu&s;&s;ion.&mdash; Upon the whole, he hopes, that the novel Manner of thus treating the&s;e Subjects, will in &s;ome Mea&s;ure atone for its many Imperfections.</P>
