<P>THE colony of Virginia, which had entered heartily into the general a&s;&s;ociation from the begin|ning, began now to feel the effects of their oppo&s;ition to government. They had not as yet proceeded to any acts of violence, though they were ripe for the mo&s;t violent mea&s;ures. What contributed much to incen&s;e and irritate to the highe&s;t pitch, was the haughtine&s;s and fury of their Governors: A noble|man of a furious temper, and un&s;ufferable pride, who being of an arbitrary di&s;po&s;ition, was more di&s;po&s;ed to rule according to his own will, than according to the laws of the colony, and the &s;pirit of the Engli&s;h con&s;titution. This colony having delegates at the ge|neral congre&s;s, fully declared their principles, and &s;he wed what their opinions of the government were.
<PB N="4" REF="4">The Governor con&s;idered it as an affront to his pow|er for the coloni&s;ts to choo&s;e commi&s;&s;ioners to repre|&s;ent them in an a&s;&s;embly which held the power and authority of Britain at defiance. He proceeded therefore to &s;uch mea&s;ures; as plainly hinted his jea|lou&s;y of the loyalty of the Virginians, and intimated by palpable &s;ignatures that he mi&s;tru&s;ted them, and in|tended to behave towards them as a people really di&s;affected to his Maje&s;ty's government. The Virgi|nians had very different notions of loyalty from Lord Dunmore; they con&s;idered loyalty to be directed by certain laws, which &s;et bounds to it; whereas he mea&s;ured his ideas of loyalty by the power of his Ma|je&s;ty and the emoluments that attended it. Re&s;pect to the Sovereign mu&s;t always keep pace with the laws of the land, otherwi&s;e it degenerates into &s;ervile adulation, and i&s;&s;ues in actual &s;lavery. Almo&s;t every viceroy lays claim to dignity and dominion equal to the Sovereign him&s;elf, and is more di&s;gu&s;ted at oppo|&s;ition to his power and intere&s;t than at oppo&s;ition to his Ma&s;ter's authority. An hungry nobleman, edu|cated in all the high notions of his own con&s;equence, without patrimony to &s;upport his dignity, is of all men whatever the mo&s;t unfit for a &s;ub&s;titute of royal|ty; his vanity would gra&s;p an empire, and his pride would devour the habitable world. When once he is exalted to preferment, where emoluments are like|ly to be had to increa&s;e his power, he &s;oon turns op|pre&s;&s;or to advance a &s;tep higher. The ranks of men beneath him are only con&s;idered as &s;o many beings made for no other end than to &s;erve the purpo&s;es of his avarice, power, and ambition. The Virginians had always been among the free&s;t in expre&s;&s;ing their re&s;olutions, and the readie&s;t in &s;hewing their determi|nations
<PB N="5" REF="5">to &s;upport at all ri&s;ks and events what they judged or termed the rights of America. In other re|&s;pects they pre&s;erved the greate&s;t order, quietne&s;s, and tranquility in the province; and not with&s;tanding the anxiety excited by the prorogation and di&s;&s;olu|tion of their a&s;&s;emblies, and the expiration of their mi|litia laws in con&s;equence thereof, which in that coun|ty where a great part of the people are in a &s;tate of &s;lavery, was a circum&s;tance of an alarming nature, yet with the&s;e cau&s;es of complaint the people &s;eemed to pay a more than ordinary degree of attention and per&s;onal regard to the Earl of Dunmore, their Gover|nor. In this &s;tate of affairs however the want of a legal a&s;&s;embly &s;eemed to give &s;ome &s;anction to the holding of a convention: upon which a provincial congre&s;s was a&s;&s;embled in the month of March, 1775, who under the colour of an old law of the year 1738, which was &s;till &s;aid to be in force, took mea&s;ures for arraying the militia; but to &s;upply the defects in that law in &s;ome mea&s;ure, to remedy which it was pretended all the &s;ub&s;equent ones had been pa&s;&s;ed, they recom|mended to each county to rai&s;e a company of volun|teers for the better defence and protection of the province.</P>
<P>This proceeding greatly alarmed the Governor; for it was an interference with this power of the crown, in a matter of very great con&s;equence; and it is &s;uppo&s;ed that the Governor had either neglected his duty, or that they intended no longer to tru&s;t the defence of the province in his hands. Such daring proceedings would have probably rou&s;ed a man le&s;s &s;u&s;ceptible of an affront than Lord Dunmore, and have produced &s;ome enquiry into the cau&s;e thereof. His Lord&s;hip, in&s;tead of making a particular enquiry into
<PB N="6" REF="6">the cau&s;e of this re&s;olution, which he apprehended he perfectly under&s;tood, proceeded immediately to prevent the effects, which he fore&s;aw would follow of con&s;equence. There was a public magazine belong|ing to the colony in the capital of William&s;burgh, which was laid up in there, in ca&s;e of any emergency ari&s;ing from the tumults of the negroes, or any other accident that might happen in the country. The Go|vernor intended to &s;ucure this magazine for &s;ear the coloni&s;ts &s;hould make u&s;e of it in a way detrimental to the intere&s;ts of government. He employed the cap|tain of an armed ve&s;&s;el which lay at a few miles di&s;|tance in James's river, with a detachment of marines to convey the powder by night aboard the &s;hip.&mdash; Tho' this mea&s;ure was conducted with great privacy, it was by &s;ome means di&s;covered the next morning, when the apparent &s;ecrecy and &s;eeming my&s;terious|ne&s;s of the act, increa&s;ed the con&s;ternation and alarm, among the inhabitants, who immediately a&s;&s;embled with arms &s;uch as they had in their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, with an intention of demanding or perhaps obtaining re&s;titu|tion of the gun-powder. The mayor and corpora|tion however prevented their proceeding to any ex|tremities whil&s;t they pre&s;ented an addre&s;s to the Go|vernor, &s;tating the injury, reclaiming the powder as a matter of right, and &s;hewing the dangers to which they were peculiarly liable from the in&s;urrection of the &s;laves, a calamity which for &s;ometime had been particularly apprehended, and which the removal of their only defence would at any time accelerate.</P>
<P>His Lord&s;hip acknowledged that the gun-powder had been removed by his order, and &s;aid that as he had heard of an in&s;urrection in a neighbouring coun|ty, and did not think it &s;ecure in the magazine, he
<PB N="7" REF="7">had removed it to a place of perfect &s;ecurity; but pro|mi&s;ed that it &s;hould be returned when ever any in&s;ur|rection rendered it nece&s;&s;ary. He al&s;o &s;aid, that it had been removed in the night to prevent giving an alarm; and expre&s;&s;ed great &s;urpri&s;e at the people's a&s;&s;embling in arms;&mdash;and further ob&s;erved, that he did not think it prudent to put powder into their hands in &s;uch a &s;ituation. Whether this an&s;wer &s;atisfied the magi&s;trates or not does not appear very evident, but for the pre&s;ent they prevailed on the people to retire quietly to their hou&s;es, without any particular outrage being committed. It appeared that they were far from intending any outrage, for it was proved by the mo&s;t inconte&s;tible evidence before the a&s;&s;em|bly that the officers of the men of war on that &s;ta|tion, and particularly the gentleman that removed the powder, and was mo&s;t particularly obnoxious, ap|peared publicly in the &s;treets during the time of the greate&s;t commotion without receiving the &s;malle&s;t in|&s;ult. A report being however &s;pread in the evening, that a detachment from the men of war were upon their march to the city, the people again took to their arms, and continued all night upon the watch, as if in expectation of an attack from an enemy.&mdash; They al&s;o from this time enerea&s;ed the night paroles; and &s;hewed an evident de&s;ign to protect the magazine from any further attempts.</P>
<P>The whole value of the gunpowder and arms in the magazine, for any purpo&s;e to which they were capa|ble of being converted, either in the hands of friends or enemies, appeared very inadequate to the alarm, &s;u&s;picion, and di&s;turbance which this mea&s;ure excited. &mdash;The quantity of powder removed amounted only to fifteen half barrels, containing fifty pounds each,
<PB N="8" REF="8">of a very ordinary &s;ort, aad the remaining &s;tock left in the magazine, to about &s;ix of the fame &s;ort. Nei|ther does it appear that the number of &s;erviceable mu&s;kets was &s;ufficient to an&s;wer any e&s;&s;ential purpo&s;e, or even to ju&s;tify apprehen&s;ion, and the caution of &s;tripping the&s;e of their locks only marked their &s;u&s;pi|cion from whence it proceeded. A con&s;iderable quan|tity of old arms and common trading guns were not touched. Upon the whole, this act derived its only importance from time, manner, and circum&s;tance. A jealou&s;y had ari&s;en between the Governor and the coloni&s;ts, from a cau&s;e exceedingly obvious, and nei|ther the conduct of the one nor the other was direct|ed by candour and di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s. The Governor &s;eems to have been exceedingly irritated at the be|haviour of the people in the&s;e commotions, and proba|bly re&s;ented it too highly (con&s;idering the times,) a&s;|&s;embling in arms, not only without, but with an evi|dent intention to oppo&s;e his authority. In this warmth of temper &s;ome threatenings were thrown out, which upon cool reflection would probably have been avoid|ed. Among the&s;e a threatening of &s;etting up the roy|al &s;tandard, of enfranchi&s;ing the negroes, arming them again&s;t their ma&s;ters, and de&s;troying the city, with o|ther expre&s;&s;ions of a &s;imilar nature and tendency, &s;pread a general alarm throughout the colony, and excited a &s;ort of abhorrence of government, and an incurable &s;u&s;picion of its de&s;igns.&mdash;Several public meetings were now held in different counties, in all which the mea&s;ures of &s;eizing and removing the pow|der, as well as the governors threatenings were re|probated in the &s;tronge&s;t terms. Some of the gen|tlemen of Hanover, and others of the neighbouring counties, were not &s;atisfied with &s;imple declarations
<PB N="9" REF="9">They a&s;&s;embled in arms to a con&s;iderable number, un|der the conduct of a Mr Henry, who was one of the provincial delegates to the general congre&s;s, and marched towards William&s;burgh with an avowed de|&s;ign to obtain re&s;titution for the gunpowder, but to take &s;uch effectual mea&s;ures for &s;ecuring the public trea&s;ury, as &s;hould prevent its experiencing a &s;i|milar fate with the magazine. A negociation was however entered into with the magi&s;trates, when they had arrived within a few miles of the town, in which it was fully &s;ettled, that the Receiver-general of the colony's &s;everity for paying the value of the powder, &s;hould be accepted as a re&s;titution, and that upon the inhabitants engaging for the future to guard both trea&s;ury and magazine, the in&s;urgents &s;hould return to their habitations.</P>
<P>The Governor began now to perceive that the af|fair was now &s;erious, and that the people were in ear|ne&s;t; he thought him&s;elf and his family in danger, and provided for &s;afety aboard the Fowey man of war in James's river, while his Lord&s;hip, with the a&s;|&s;i&s;tance of a detachment of marines, converted his pa|lace into a little garri&s;on, fortified it in the be&s;t man|ner he was able, and &s;urrounded it with artillery. A proclamation was then i&s;&s;ued by the Governor and his council, in which Henry and his followers were charged with rebellious practices, in extorting the va|lue of the powder from the Receiver-general, and the pre&s;ent commotions were attributed to di&s;affec|tion in the people and a de&s;ire of changing the e&s;ta|bli&s;hed form of government, &s;erving only to afford more room for altercation, and to encrea&s;e the heat and di&s;content. Several county meetings were held, the conduct of Henry vindicated and applauded, and
<PB N="10" REF="10">re&s;olutions pa&s;&s;ed that at the ri&s;que of every thing dear, he and his followers &s;hould be indemnified from all &s;uffering, lo&s;s and injury, upon that account. The charge of di&s;affection was peremptorily denied, and tho&s;e of changing the form of government, and cau&s;|ing the pre&s;ent troubles, retorted. They in&s;i&s;ted that they wanted nothing but to pre&s;erve their ancient con&s;titution, and only oppo&s;ed innovations, and that all the di&s;turbances &s;prung from the Governor's late conduct.</P>
<P>As there are times when all circum&s;tances &s;eem to con&s;pire towards the nouri&s;hment and increa&s;e of po|litical, as well as natural di&s;orders, &s;o it appeared now in Virginia, every thing tended to one common cen|tre of di&s;tru&s;t, jealou&s;y, and di&s;content. The copy of &s;ome letters from the Governor to the mini&s;ter of the American department were by &s;ome means pro|cured, and containing not only unfavourable, but un|fair and unju&s;t repre&s;entations, as well as of facts, as of the temper and di&s;po&s;ition of the colony. Thus one di&s;tru&s;t begot another, until all confidence being totally lo&s;t on both &s;ides, every fal&s;e report that was circulated was believed on either, and &s;erved up for a time to keep up the public fever.</P>
<P>In this &s;tate of commotion and di&s;order, upon the arrival of di&s;patches from England, the General a&s;|&s;embly was &s;uddenly and unexpectedly convened by the Governor, June 1&s;t. The grand motive for this mea&s;ure was to procure their approbation and ac|ceptance of the terms included in Lord North's con|ciliatory motion, and the parliamentary re&s;olutions founded thereon. His Lord&s;hip accordingly in his &s;peech u&s;ed his utmo&s;t addre&s;s to carry his point: he
<PB N="11" REF="11">&s;tated the favourable di&s;po&s;ition of parliament as well as of government towards the colonies, the modera|tion, tenderne&s;s, and equity which induced the pre|&s;ent advances towards a happy reconciliation. He dwelt upon the ju&s;tice of their contributing to the com|mon defence, and bearing an equitable proportion of the public burdens; and ob&s;erved, that as no &s;peci|fic &s;um was demanded, they had an opportunity of giving free &s;cope to their ju&s;tice and liberality, and whatever they gave would be a free gift, in the fulle&s;t &s;en&s;e of the terms; that they would thus &s;hew their reverence to parliament, and manife&s;t their duty and attachment to the Sovereign, and the kindne&s;s with which it would be taken, that they met on their &s;ide; the favourable di&s;po&s;ition &s;hewn on the other, to|wards bringing the pre&s;ent unhappy di&s;putes to a pe|riod. He al&s;o took pains to convince them from the re&s;olutions and proceedings of parliament, that a full redre&s;s of grievances would be the immediate con&s;e|quence of their compliance. This &s;peech, though flattering and plau&s;ible, was con&s;idered as only words of cour&s;e, intended to an&s;wer the purpo&s;e of the go|vernment, without any intention of redre&s;&s;ing any of tho&s;e grievances which were complained of. It was not fully credited, that provided the a&s;&s;embly would grant the &s;upplies which were wanted, that any more notice would be taken of the heavy grievances they were groaning under.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t act of the a&s;&s;embly was the appointment of a committee to enquire into the cau&s;e of the late di&s;turbances, and particularly to examine the &s;tate of the magazine, that nece&s;&s;ary mea&s;ures might be taken for &s;upplying the want of what had been taken away. Tho' the magazine was the property of the colony,
<PB N="12" REF="12">it was in the cu&s;tody of the Governor who appointed a keeper, &s;o that an application to him was nece&s;&s;ary for admittance. While &s;ome di&s;pute aro&s;e concern|ing this &s;ubject, and before the order for admittance was obtained, &s;ome people in the town and neigh|bourghood broke into the magazine, and carried off &s;ome of the arms. Several members of the Hou&s;e of Burge&s;&s;es u&s;ed their per&s;onal intere&s;t and application in getting as many of them returned back as they could. It appeared by the report of the Committee that they found mo&s;t of the remainder of the powder buried in the magazine yard, where it had been de|po&s;ited by the Governor's orders, and &s;uffered con&s;i|derable damage from the rains; the depriving the mu&s;kets of their locks was likewi&s;e di&s;covered, as well as the nakedne&s;s of the magazine in all re&s;pects. A|mong other things which tended to provoke the peo|ple was the planting of &s;pring guns in the magazine, without giving any public notice of this mode of &s;e|curity, and &s;ome effect they had taken at the time of the late depredations. Whil&s;t the Governor's &s;peech, with the propo&s;itions which it recommended were yet under the con&s;ideration of the a&s;&s;embly, and before the addre&s;s was determined, con&s;cience, which makes cowards of all guilty per&s;ons, had made his Lord|&s;hip, for fear of con&s;equences, retire with his Lady on board the Fowey man of war, which then lay near York Town, on the river of the &s;ame name. It is highly probable that his Lord&s;hip had been informed of the rage of the people upon the di&s;covery of the &s;pring guns, and being con&s;cious of &s;ome guilt in that matter,, thought fit to withdraw to a place of more &s;ecurity and &s;afety. He left a me&s;&s;age behind him for the Hou&s;e of Burge&s;&s;es, informing them, that he
<PB N="13" REF="13">thought it prudent to retire to a place of &s;afety, as he was &s;ully per&s;uaded that both him&s;elf and his fami|ly were con&s;tant danger of falling &s;acrifices to the blind and unmea&s;urable fury of the people, but that &s;o far from interrupting their &s;itting, he hoped they would &s;ucce&s;sfully acquit them&s;elves in the great bu&s;i|ne&s;s before them, that he would render the communi|cation between him and the hou&s;e as ea&s;y and as &s;afe as po&s;&s;ible; and that he thought it would be more a|greeable to them to &s;end &s;ome of their members to him as occa&s;ion &s;hould require, than to have the trou|ble of removing their whole body to a nearer place. He a&s;&s;ured them that he &s;hould attend as u&s;ual to the duties of his office, and of his good di&s;po&s;ition to re|&s;tore that harmony which had been &s;o unhappily in|terrupted. Such meanne&s;s and imbecility in the Go|vernor tended much to weaken the cau&s;e of govern|ment in that province; for it argued both a &s;u&s;picion of guilt, and a di&s;tru&s;ting the people, which was not the method to reconcile their minds to any plan the government &s;hould propo&s;e.</P>
<P>When the me&s;&s;age was produced, the Council and Burge&s;&s;es &s;ent an addre&s;s to his Lord&s;hip, declaring their unbelief that any per&s;on in the province could meditate &s;o horrid and atrocious a crime as his Lord|&s;hip apprehended, lamenting that he had not acquaint|ed them with the grounds of his unea&s;ine&s;s before he had adopted that mea&s;ure, as they would have u&s;ed all the po&s;&s;ible means to have removed every cau&s;e of di&s;quietude: they feared that his removal from the &s;eat of government would be a means of increa&s;ing the unea&s;ine&s;s which unhappily prevailed among the people, and they declared that they would chearfully concur in any mea&s;ure that he &s;hould propo&s;e for the
<PB N="14" REF="14">&s;ecurity of him&s;elf and family; ob&s;erving how im|practicable it would be to carry on the bu&s;ine&s;s of the &s;e&s;&s;ions with any degree of propriety or di&s;patch, while he was at &s;uch a di&s;tance, and &s;o inconvenient|ly &s;ituated. They concluded by intreating him to re|turn with his Lady and family to the palace, which would afford great public &s;atisfaction, and be the likely method of quieting the minds of the people.</P>
<P>Upon the tenth of June, Lord Dunmore returned a written an&s;wer, in which he ju&s;tified his apprehen|&s;ions of danger from the public notoriety of the com|motions and tumults among the people, as well as from the menaces and threatenings with which they were attended; be&s;ides he complained of the gene|ral conduct and behaviour of the Hou&s;e of Burge&s;&s;es, and &s;pecified &s;everal charges again&s;t that body.&mdash; That they had countenanced the violent and di&s;order|ly proceedings of the people, particularly with regard to the magazine, which was forced open and plun|dered in pre&s;ence of &s;ome of the members; that in|&s;tead of committing tho&s;e per&s;ons who had been guilty of &s;o daring and heinous an offence, they only endeavoured to procure a re&s;titution of the arms.&mdash; That the Hou&s;e or its Committee had proceeded to a &s;tep fraught with the mo&s;t alarming con&s;equences, in appointing guards without his approbation or con|&s;ent, under pretence of protecting the magazine, thereby &s;hewing a de&s;ign of u&s;urping the executive power, and of &s;ubverting the con&s;titution. He took notice that no means could be effectual for affording the &s;ecurity they propo&s;ed to concur in, but by re|in&s;tating him in the full powers of his office, by open|ing the courts of ju&s;tice, and re&s;toring the energy of the laws, by di&s;arming all independent companies, or
<PB N="15" REF="15">other bodies of men rai&s;ed and acting in defiance of legal authority; by obliging the immediate return of the King's arms and &s;tores, and by what was no le&s;s e&s;&s;ential than any other matter, their own example, and their endeavours to remove that general delu&s;ion which kept the minds of the people in a continual ferment, and thereby to aboli&s;h that malice and &s;pi|rit of per&s;ecution, which now operated &s;o danger|ou&s;ly again&s;t tho&s;e who from duty and affection to their King and country oppo&s;ed the pre&s;ent mea&s;ures, and who from principle and conviction differed with the multitude in political principles. That the&s;e were the means to afford the &s;ecurity requi&s;ite for all par|ties; and that for the accompli&s;hment of tho&s;e ends, together with the great object and nece&s;&s;ary bu&s;ine&s;s of the &s;e&s;&s;ion, he &s;hould have no objection of their adjournment to the town of York, where he would meet them, and remain till the bu&s;ine&s;s was fini&s;hed. He concluded by repre&s;enting, that unle&s;s they had a &s;incere and active regard of &s;eizing the opportunity which was now offered by parliament, of e&s;tabli&s;hing the freedom of their country upon a fixed and known foundation, and of uniting them&s;elves with their fel|low &s;ubjects of Great Britain in one common bond of intere&s;t and mutual a&s;&s;i&s;tance, his return to Williams|burgh would be as fruitle&s;s to the people as it might po&s;&s;ibly be dangerous to him; but that if their pro|ceedings manife&s;ted that happy di&s;po&s;ition, he would return with the greate&s;t joy, and con&s;ider it as the mo&s;t fortunate event of his life, if they gave him an opportunity to be an in&s;trument of promoting their happine&s;s, and of being a &s;ucce&s;sful mediator between them and the &s;upreme authority.</P>
<PB N="16" REF="16">
<P>The &s;oftening terms in the conclu&s;ion of this long and tedious me&s;&s;age, were by no means equal to re|move the acrimony excited by tho&s;e &s;evere charges and implications in the former part of it. They con|&s;idered the &s;mooth words as nothing more than poli|tical court fine&s;&s;e, to which all courtiers are accu&s;tom|ed, without ever intending to perform what they &s;ay. The charges which his Lord&s;hip brought a|gain&s;t the Hou&s;e of Burge&s;s produced a reply of an uncommon length, under the form of an addre&s;s, which was full of the bitterne&s;s of recrimination, as well as of defen&s;ive arguments, and an examination of facts. This was a method of addre&s;s no ways plea&s;ing to the pride, and ambition of the Governor, who wanted to conceal &s;ome facts by which his honour and character were much tarni&s;hed.</P>
<P>The Hou&s;e had now received the report of its com|mittee concerning the cau&s;e of the late di&s;turbance, backed with the de&s;po&s;ition of a number of Briti&s;h merchants, who were re&s;ident in different and re|mote parts of the colony, all who&s;e te&s;timonies tend|ed to &s;hew the general tranquility which prevailed previous to the affair of the powder, and the Gover|nor's declaration with regard to the emancipating of the &s;laves; the latter of which &s;o far as it was be|lieved, had particularly irritated the people, yet notwith&s;tanding quiet and order were every where re&s;tored, and &s;till continued; that there was a general acquie&s;cence every where in the determinations of the general and provincial congre&s;s; but they all con|curred in believing that the people had no de&s;ign or wi&s;h of an independency on Great Britain; on the contrary that they had an eager de&s;ire for &s;uch a con|nection, as it &s;tood before the late acts of parliament.
<PB N="17" REF="17">They were unanimous in their opinion, that a redre&s;s of grievances complained of, would e&s;tabli&s;h a per|fect tranquility, and produce a reconciliation with the parent &s;tate.</P>
<P>To refute the charges of di&s;affection and di&s;loyalty, the Hou&s;e of Burge&s;&s;es took a retro&s;pective view of the behaviour of the people, and of &s;everal tran&s;ac|tions in the colony for &s;ome years back; they &s;tated the happine&s;s which they derived from the conduct of former Governors, as a &s;triking contra&s;t to their pre|&s;ent &s;ituation. They attributed that happine&s;s particu|larly in a very late in&s;tance to the di&s;countenancing of tale-bearers and malicious informers, to the proper examination of every &s;ubject, and the taking of no|thing upon tru&s;t; and finally, to the tran&s;mitting home a faithful repre&s;entation of things in the colo|ny. They &s;tate their former conduct with re&s;pect to his Lord&s;hip, and ob&s;erved that changes &s;eldom hap|pen without &s;ome &s;ufficient cau&s;e; that re&s;pect was not to be obtained by force from a free people:&mdash; that nothing was more likely to in&s;ure it as dignity of character, a candid and exemplary conduct. That they did not mean to in&s;inuate that his Lord&s;hip had de&s;ignedly mi&s;repre&s;ented facts; but it was feared he too ea&s;ily grave credit to de&s;igning per&s;ons, who to the great injury of the community, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed much too large a &s;hare of his confidence. They denied the facts, and examined with great &s;everity the repre&s;ent|ations contained in two letters which were &s;ent to Lord Dartmouth, which have already been hinted. The&s;e they repre&s;ented as exceedingly imperious and unju&s;t, being founded on mi&s;conception, mi&s;informa|tion, the height of colouring, the mi&s;taking of the a&s;|&s;umption of facts without proof or evidence to &s;upport
<PB N="18" REF="18">them. They then proceeded to ju&s;tify the &s;teps that had been taken with regard to their &s;uppo&s;ed coun|tenance to the acts done concerning the magazine, and the other matters which excited, and afterwards inflamed the controver&s;y.</P>
<P>Upon the fourteenth of June the Hou&s;e of Bur|ge&s;&s;es pre&s;ented their addre&s;s in an&s;wer to the Gover|nor's &s;peech, in which they entered into a long di&s;|cu&s;&s;ion of the propo&s;ition contained in the parliamen|tary re&s;olution, founded upon Lord North's concilia|tory motion. This they combated upon the &s;ame principles and grounds, with a variety of arguments, of the &s;ame nature with tho&s;e that have been already &s;tated; and they ultimately declared, that as it only changed the form of expre&s;&s;ion, without le&s;&s;ening its burthen, they could not clo&s;e with the terms. They yb&s;erved that the&s;e were only offered as the &s;enti|ments of an individual part of the whole empire; and for a final determination they referred the affair to the General Congre&s;s, before whom they would lay the paper. To them al&s;o they referred the di&s;covery of the proper mode of repre&s;enting their well-founded grievances, which his Lord&s;hip a&s;&s;ured them would meet with the attention and regard &s;o ju&s;tly due to them. In behalf of them&s;elves, they made the fol|lowing declaration:&mdash;we have exhau&s;ted every mode of application which our invention could &s;egge&s;t, as proper and promi&s;ing. We have decently remon&s;tra|ted with parliament; they have added new injuries to the old; we have wearied our King with &s;upplica|tions, and he has not deigned to an&s;wer us. We have appealed to the native honour and ju&s;tice of the Bri|ti&s;h nation; their efforts in our favour have been hi|therto ineffectual.&mdash;When the rea&s;onings on both
<PB N="19" REF="19">&s;ides are impartially con&s;idered, it mu&s;t be allowed that the tempers of the di&s;putants appear very mani|fe&s;tly intermingled with their arguments. Their in|tere&s;ts al&s;o appear vi&s;ibly to weigh heavy in the &s;cale of di&s;putation, which in all things that relate to human things bear a mighty &s;way. Lord Dunmore proba|bly imagined to rule in Virginia in &s;uch a manner, (ac|cording to his inclination) and for &s;uch a time till his fortune was &s;ufficiently enlarged, and being di&s;appoint|ed in his view, would be likely to colour his account of the proceedings of the coloni&s;ts in the highe&s;t ta&s;te. The Virginians, who con&s;idered them&s;elves as a free people, and not under the juri&s;diction of a legi&s;lature where they were not repre&s;ented, viewed in all tho&s;e acts which the Governor was for putting in execution as acts of tyranny and oppre&s;&s;ion, which he for the &s;ake of his own intere&s;t wanted to force upon them. They were irritated with the thought of having new taxing impo&s;ed upon them, without their con&s;ent, and were not likely to &s;peak favourably of the agent im|mediately employed to inforce the payment of them. New taxes have always been unpopular in all &s;tates, when the people could not perceive their own inte|re&s;ts in paying of them; and it is highly impolitic to propo&s;e a taxation that is univer&s;ally contrary to the minds of the &s;ubjects. What makes taxation &s;till more di&s;agreeable is, when the government of a na|tion creates places of &s;inecure, which are &s;upported merely by burdens laid upon the people. In this ca&s;e the &s;ubjects con&s;ider their &s;ub&s;tance wa&s;ted for no valuable purpo&s;e, but rather u&s;ele&s;ly &s;pent in &s;upport|ing idle and u&s;ele&s;s members of the community, that might be otherwi&s;e engaged in &s;ome active employ|ment. A labouring and indu&s;trious people, who gain
<PB N="20" REF="20">their &s;ub&s;tance from labour and frugality, can never well endure to &s;ee it &s;pent upon haughty noblemen and in&s;olvent courtiers.</P>
<P>It will readily be &s;ugge&s;ted, that in this &s;tate of ill-humour and di&s;tru&s;t on both &s;ides, every day would produce new occa&s;ions of di&s;pute and altercation.&mdash; Every new occurrence afforded new rea&s;ons of &s;u&s;|picion, and fre&s;h bickerings happened every day:&mdash; There was a continual intercour&s;e by addre&s;&s;es, me&s;&s;a|ges, and an&s;wers, between the Hou&s;e of Burge&s;&s;es and the Fowey man of war, which was now the court of the Governor. This was a &s;ingular &s;ituation; an attempt to govern without choo&s;ing or finding it &s;afe to &s;et a foot on &s;hore in the country to be governed; it had all the appearance of an abdication, or de&s;erting the government at a time when there was the mo&s;t need of &s;teadine&s;s, advice, and execution.</P>
<P>When the nece&s;&s;ary bills were pa&s;&s;ed, and the ad|vanced &s;ea&s;on required their attendance in their &s;eve|ral counties, the Council and Burge&s;&s;es jointly en|treated the Governor's pre&s;ence to give his a&s;&s;ent to them, and fini&s;h the &s;e&s;&s;ion. They took notice that though the bu&s;ine&s;s had been greatly impeded by his ab&s;ence from the feat of government, and they had &s;ubmitted to the inconvenience of repeatedly &s;ending their members twelve miles to attend his Excellency on board a &s;hip of war, they could not but think it highly improper, and too great a departure from the con&s;titutional and accu&s;tomed practice of tran&s;acting bu&s;iness, to pre&s;ent the bills to him at any other place than the capital. His Excellency returned a rough an&s;wer to this reque&s;t. He in&s;i&s;ted upon his right of calling them to any place of the colony where the ex|igency of affairs might render their attendance nece&s;|&s;ary,
<PB N="21" REF="21">He further ob&s;erved, that as he had not been acquainted with the whole proceedings of the a&s;&s;em|bly, he knew of no bills of importance, which if he were inclined to ri&s;que his per&s;on again among the people, they had to pre&s;ent to him, nor whether they were &s;uch as he could a&s;&s;ent to if they had.</P>
<P>To obviate the&s;e objections, though it was an un|precedented act, the a&s;&s;embly &s;ent the bills, as well as other papers which were afterwards demanded, on board the Fowey, for his in&s;pection. The mo&s;t im|portant and intere&s;ting of the&s;e bills &s;eemingly to all parties was, that for the payment of the forces who had lately under his Lord&s;hip's command &s;uffered con&s;iderably, at the &s;ame time they had done e&s;&s;ential &s;ervice to their country by their bravery and &s;ucce&s;s in the Indian war. The bill was objected to by the Governor, for its impo&s;ing a tax upon the importa|tion of &s;laves, and for &s;ome informality in re&s;pect to the emi&s;&s;ion of paper money. The other bills were approved of.</P>
<P>The Hou&s;e of Burge&s;&s;es upon this returned an ad|dre&s;s to his Lord&s;hip, intreating him that he would meet them the en&s;uing day at William&s;burgh to pa&s;s the bills that were ready; they expre&s;&s;ed their hopes that he could not &s;till entertain any groundle&s;s fears of per&s;onal danger; but declared, that it was impo&s;&s;ible he could remain under &s;o &s;trange an influence, and pledged their honour and every thing &s;acred for his &s;ecurity. If nothing could pre|vail, they reque&s;ted that he would grant a commi&s;&s;ion for pa&s;&s;ing &s;uch bills as he approved. This was the la&s;t addre&s;s of the Hou&s;e of Burge&s;&s;es to his Excel|lency. Lord Dunmore per&s;i&s;ted to the objections he had made to the bill; and &s;aid that the well-ground|ed
<PB N="22" REF="22">cau&s;e he had for believing his per&s;on not &s;afe at William&s;burgh increa&s;ed daily. That he therefore could not meet them, as they requ&s;ted, at the capital, but that he would be ready to receive the Hou&s;e on the following Monday, at his pre&s;ent re&s;idence, for the purpo&s;e of giving his a&s;&s;ent to &s;uch bills as he &s;hould approve. This an&s;wer put an end to all pub|lic corre&s;pondence and bu&s;ine&s;s between Lord Dun|more and the colony. The transferring the legi&s;lative council and hou&s;e of repre&s;entatives of a great coun|try on board a man of war, was evidently not to be expected. The danger of the members of the coun|cil and hou&s;e of repre&s;entatives in &s;uch a &s;ituation if on other accounts it were po&s;&s;ible they could put them&s;elves into it, was no le&s;s than Lord Dunmore's could be upon land. To have put them&s;elves into the hands and power of an enraged Governor, who had declared them guilty of rebellion, and threatened them with military laws, would have been an in&s;tance of imprudence, unworthy of any people of common &s;en&s;e. The Governor's general character as a man of prudence and di&s;cretion, was not &s;o remarkable as to tempt them to run &s;uch a ri&s;k. They therefore wi&s;ely declined going a-board to his Lord&s;hip, and voted his Lord&s;hip's demand a breach of privilege.&mdash; They &s;aid, the unrea&s;onable delays thrown into their proceedings, and the eva&s;ive an&s;wers given to their &s;incere and decent addre&s;&s;es, gave them rea&s;on to fear that a dangerous attack was meditated again&s;t the un|happy people of that colony, and it was therefore their opinion that they &s;hould prepare for the pre|&s;ervation of their ine&s;timable rights and privileges.&mdash; They concluded by &s;trongly expre&s;&s;ing their loyalty to the king and regard to the mother country, and
<PB N="23" REF="23">upon this they concluded the &s;e&s;&s;ion. Thus unhap|pily was an end put for the pre&s;ent to the Engli&s;h government in the colony of Virginia, which it is doubtful, if ever it &s;hall be re&s;tored again by either force or goodwill.</P>
<P>Upon the 18th of July, a convention of delegates was appointed to &s;upply the place of the a&s;&s;embly, who had an unlimited confidence repo&s;ed in them by the people, and became accordingly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of an unlimited power in all public affairs. The&s;e immedi|ately took in hand the rai&s;ing and embodying of an armed force, as well as providing means for its &s;up|port, and pur&s;ued every other means which could tend to place the colony in a &s;trong &s;tate of defence. &mdash;The&s;e were dangerous &s;teps, the con&s;equence of which i&s;&s;ued in actual rebellion again&s;t government, and expo&s;ed the colonies to the vengeance of the for|mer executive power. Again&s;t the charge of rebel|lion they vindicated them&s;elves by tracing the mea|&s;ures of government that led to the pre&s;ent unhappy &s;tate of public affairs. They &s;et forth the cau&s;e of their meeting, and &s;hewed the nece&s;&s;ity of immedi|ately putting the country in a &s;tate of defence for the protection of their lives, liberties, and properties.&mdash; They concluded that what they had done was pur&s;u|ed with the &s;tronge&s;t regard to faith and loyalty, and they declared, that as on the one hand they were determined, at the peril of the extreme&s;t hazards, to maintain their ju&s;t rights and privileges; &s;o on the o|ther hand, it was their fixed and unalterable re&s;olu|tion to di&s;band &s;uch forces as were for the defence of the colony, whenever their dangers were removed, and America re&s;tored to its former &s;tate of tranquility and happine&s;s.</P>
<PB N="24" REF="24">
<P>In de&s;putes of this &s;ort it is common for each par|ty to think them&s;elves in the right, and their argu|ments will always partake of that colouring which is neare&s;t to private intere&s;t. Per&s;ons who have been educated from their infancy in ideas of royal preroga|tive and the omnipotence of government, will always think it &s;trange to hear a people in&s;i&s;ting upon the principles of the &s;ocial compact, and the rights of &s;o|ciety; this in the fir&s;t degree has a rebellious &s;ound in their ears, and they are ready to conclude that &s;uch a people de&s;erve the &s;evere&s;t puni&s;hment for in|dulging &s;uch di&s;loyal notions and &s;entiments. In free &s;tates where men are accu&s;tomed to examine all things freely, it appears as &s;trange to hear of the will of a few being a law to a whole &s;ociety, and every one to bend his neck at the nod of a grand monarch.&mdash; Such a &s;tate of exi&s;tence to free men appears to be wor&s;e than none at all, and they would &s;ooner die than live under &s;uch a &s;lavery. Rea&s;on on both &s;ides would determine the point &s;peedily, would each par|ty &s;tand to her impartial dictates; but pa&s;&s;ion for the mo&s;t part takes the lead, and the voice of rea&s;on is but little regarded. Yet it will be found next to a maxim, that the common people &s;eldom depart from rea&s;on till they are corrupted by the precepts or ex|ample of the great. Their demands are generally rea&s;onable, and founded upon principles of common &s;en&s;e, till they are corrupted and mi&s;led by their &s;upe|riors, who often corrupt them for their own intere&s;t, and makes them at la&s;t dupes to their lu&s;ts and pa&s;&s;ions. For as corrupt as human nature is &s;aid to be, it is ma|nife&s;t, that provided men were to have the tutorage which God has provided unadulterated, the common ranks of men would &s;hew more virtue than tho&s;e un|der
<PB N="25" REF="25">the influence of greate&s;t refinement. It ap|pears marvelous to a plain well-meaning man to hear it affirmed that per&s;ons whom he &s;ees daily commit|ting all &s;ort of vice without &s;hame is be&s;t qualified to be a magi&s;trate or ruler of the people. He can hard|ly bring his mind to think that reverence is due to &s;uch as do not reverence God and love truth.</P>
<P>Upon this occa&s;ion Lord Dunmore fell into that mi&s;take which the government at home, and almo&s;t all the governors abroad have fallen into. He ima|gined that he could per&s;uade the &s;laves to take up arms; and that government had more friends in the colony than there really were. This has been an univer&s;al mi&s;take all along in the ideas of government. They have continually imagined, and al&s;o declared, that their friends in the colonies were numerous, their cau&s;e pro&s;perous, when the event declared the very contary. Whatever was the pre&s;ent ground of his progre&s;s he was determined though he &s;hould be obliged for the pre&s;ent to relinqui&s;h, not to abandon his hopes, nor entirely to lo&s;s &s;ight of the country which he had governed. Being joined with tho&s;e friends of government who had rendered them&s;elves obnoxious to the people, to continue with &s;afety in the country, as well as by a number of run-a-way ne|groes, and &s;upported by the frigates of war which were upon the &s;tation, endeavoured to e&s;tabli&s;h &s;uch a marine force as would enable him, by means of the rivers which render the mo&s;t valuable parts of that rich country acce&s;&s;able by water, to be always at hand, and ready to profit by any favourable occa&s;ion that offered.</P>
<P>Some &s;uch &s;y&s;tem as this he &s;eems to have intend|ed to pur&s;ue: for by degrees he equipped and
<PB N="26" REF="26">armed a number of ve&s;&s;els, of different kinds and &s;izes, in one of which he con&s;tantly re&s;ided, never &s;etting his foot on &s;hore, but in an ho&s;tile manner. This force thus put together, was however only calculat|ed for depredation, and never became equal to any e&s;&s;ential &s;ervice. The former indeed was in &s;ome degree a matter of nece&s;&s;ity; for as the people on &s;hore would not &s;erve tho&s;e on board with proper provi&s;ions or nece&s;&s;aries, they mu&s;t either have &s;tarv|ed, or endeavoured to provide them by force. The Virginians pretended that while the depredations were confined to the&s;e nece&s;&s;ary objects, the re&s;pect which they bore to the rank of the Governor, pre|vented his marching with any re&s;i&s;tance; but their nature was &s;oon changed into open and avowed ho&s;ti|lity. Obnoxious per&s;ons they &s;aid were &s;eized and carried a-board the &s;hips; plantations were ravi&s;hed and de&s;troyed, the negroes carried off; hou&s;es burnt, and at la&s;t lives lo&s;t on both &s;ides. In one of tho&s;e expeditions his Lord&s;hip de&s;troyed a number of iron cannon, and carried off &s;ome others, which he &s;up|po&s;ed were provided for the purpo&s;es of rebellion, though the Virginians affirm they were &s;hip guns.&mdash; The&s;e proceedings occa&s;ioned the &s;ending of &s;ome of the new rai&s;ed detachments to protect the coa&s;ts, and from thence en&s;ued a little mi&s;chievous plundering war, incapable of affording honour and benefit, and in which at length every drop of water and every nece&s;&s;ary was purcha&s;ed, at the price and the ri&s;que of blood.</P>
<P>During this &s;tate of ho&s;tility, Dunmore procured a few &s;oldiers from different parts, with who&s;e a&s;&s;i&s;tance an attempt was made to burn a port town in an im|portant &s;ituation called Hampton. It would appear
<PB N="27" REF="27">that the inhabitants had &s;ome previous notice of this de&s;ign; for they had &s;unk boats in the entrance of the harbour, and thrown &s;uch other ob&s;tacles in the way as rendered the approach of the &s;hips, and con&s;e|quently the landing impracticable on the day on which this attack was begun. The &s;hips cut a way through the boats in the night, and began to canonade the town in a furious manner in the morning; but in this critical &s;ituation they were relieved from their appre|hen&s;ions and danger by the arrival of the detachment of riflemen from William&s;burgh, who had marched all night to their a&s;&s;i&s;tance. The&s;e, joined with the inhabitants, attacked the &s;hips &s;o vigorou&s;ly with their &s;mall arms, that they were obliged precipitately to quit their &s;tation, with the lo&s;s of &s;ome men, and of a tender which was taken.</P>
<P>Upon the &s;eventh of November, in con&s;equence of this repul&s;e, a proclamation was i&s;&s;ued by the Gover|nor, dated on board the &s;hip William of Norfolk, declaring, that as the civil law was at pre&s;ent in&s;uffi|cient to prevent and puni&s;h trea&s;ons and traitors, that martial law &s;hould take place, and be executed throughout the colony; and it required all per&s;ons capable of bearing arms to repair to his Maje&s;ty's &s;tandard, or to be con&s;idered as traitors.</P>
<P>This mea&s;ure of &s;etting the &s;laves at liberty gave le&s;s &s;urpri&s;e, and probably had le&s;s effect in exciting an in&s;urrection from its being &s;o long threatened and apprehended, than if it had been more immediate and unexpected. It was however received with the great|e&s;t horror in all the colonies, and was &s;everely con|demned at home, as tending to loo&s;e the bonds of &s;o|ciety, to de&s;troy dome&s;tic &s;ecurity, and to encourage the mo&s;t barbarous of minkind to the commi&s;&s;ion of
<PB N="28" REF="28">the mo&s;t horrid crimes and the mo&s;t inhuman cruel|ties. That was confounding the innocent with the guilty, and expo&s;ing tho&s;e who were the be&s;t friends to government to the &s;ame lo&s;s of property, danger, and de&s;truction, with the mo&s;t incorregible rebels.&mdash; It was &s;aid to e&s;tabli&s;h a precedent of a mo&s;t danger|ous nature in the new world, by giving a legal &s;anc|tion to arraying and embodying of African negroes, to appear in arms again&s;t the whole people, and to encounter them upon an equal footing in the field; for however ill-founded di&s;tinctions with re&s;pect to co|lour may appear, when examined by the te&s;t of nature, rea&s;on and philo&s;ophy; yet while things conti|nue in the pre&s;ent &s;tate, while commerce, luxury, and avarice, render &s;lavery a principal object in the po|litical &s;y&s;tem of every European power, that po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es dominion in America, the idea of a pre-eminence mu&s;t always be cheri&s;hed, and con&s;idered as a nece&s;&s;ary po|licy.</P>
<P>This rea&s;on, however plau&s;ible, is in its own nature immoral and unju&s;t, and the Virginians, as well as the government who encouraged and gave &s;anction to &s;la|very, could not well expect that providence would always look on and &s;uffer them to tyrannize over poor innocents that had never done them any harm, and by nature de&s;erved as much to be free as them&s;elves. Claims of liberty made by men who them&s;elves keep others in &s;lavery, are made with a very ill grace; and had the Briti&s;h government by emancipating the &s;laves meant well to the rights of mankind, every wi&s;e and good man would have wi&s;hed them &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>The proclamation, with Lord Dunmore's pre&s;ence, and the encouragement of the &s;mall marine force he had with him, produced &s;ome effect in the town of
<PB N="29" REF="29">Norfolk and the adjacent country, where many of the people were well-affected to government. He was accordingly joined by &s;ome hundreds, both of blacks and whites, and many others who did not choo&s;e to take an active part publicly abjured the Congre&s;s with all its acts, and all conventions and committees whatever. Lord Dunmore probably now expected that the facility and good di&s;po&s;ition which he experienced here would have been &s;o general as to have enabled him to have rai&s;ed a con&s;iderable body of armed troops, and probably without any foreign a&s;&s;i&s;tance, to have had the glory of reducing one part of the province by the means of the other. This plea&s;ing expedition was interrupted by intelligence that a party of the rebels were marching towards them with all expedition. To fru&s;trate their de&s;ign, and to protect the well-affected, he took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a po&s;t called the Great Bridge, which lay at &s;ome di&s;tance from Norfolk, which was a pa&s;s of great con|&s;equence, being the only way that they could ap|proach to the town. Here he con&s;tructed a fort on the Norfolk &s;ide of the Bridge which he furni&s;hed well with artillery, and rendered as defen&s;ible as the time would admit. Notwith&s;taeding the loyalty of the people in this quarter which included two &s;mall coun|ties, it does not appear that his force was at all con|&s;iderable, either as to number or quality; he had 200 regulars including the grenadiers of the 14th regi|ment, and a body called the Norfolk volunteers; the re&s;t were a motley figure of blacks and whites. The coloni&s;ts under the command of Colonel Woodford fortified them&s;elves al&s;o within le&s;s than cannon &s;hot of his Lord&s;hip's forces; they had a narrow cau&s;e|way in the front which behoved to be pa&s;&s;ed to come
<PB N="30" REF="30">at their works, &s;o that both parties appeared pretty well &s;ecured from &s;urpri&s;e. In this &s;tate they conti|nued quiet and peaceable for &s;ome days, until at length his Lord&s;hip formed a de&s;ign of &s;urpri&s;ing them in their entrenchments. This was undertaken be|fore daylight by Captain Fordyce, who at the head of his grenadiers, amounting to about &s;ixty, led on the attack. They boldly pa&s;&s;ed the cau&s;eway, and marched up to the entrenchments with fixed bayonets, and with a coolne&s;s and intrepidity which excited both the a&s;toni&s;hment and prai&s;e of their enemies;&mdash; for they were not only expo&s;ed nakedly to the fire in front, but enfiladed by another part of the works.&mdash; The brave Captain, with &s;everal of his men fell, the Lieutenant with others were taken, and all who re|mained of the grenadiers company, whether pri&s;oners or not, were wounded.</P>
<P>The fire of the artillery from the fort enabled our troops to retire without pur&s;uit, as well as to carry off many of the dead and wounded. It was reported that the &s;laves did more injury to the King's party than they did to their enemies, which &s;hews how little they were to be tru&s;ted in any enterpri&s;e of con&s;equence. It is has been &s;aid that our people were led into this unfortunate affair through the de|&s;igned fal&s;e intelligence of a de&s;erter, who was in|&s;tructed for the purpo&s;e; whatever there was in this, it was a great pity that &s;uch uncommon bravery &s;hould have been wa&s;ted to no purpo&s;e. The con|querors interred Captain Fordyce with all the honors of war, and with the re&s;pect that was due to his me|rit, as well as to the gallantry which &s;ignalized his la&s;t moments. The Engli&s;h pri&s;oners were treated with
<PB N="31" REF="31">great kindne&s;s: but the Americans who had joined the King's &s;tandard were treated with rigour.</P>
<P>The King's forces retired from the po&s;t at the Great Bridge the en&s;uing night without any other lo&s;s than &s;ome pieces of cannon, and &s;ome trifling &s;tores which they left behind; and as all hopes in this enterpri&s;e were now at an end, Lord Dunmore thought &s;it to abandon the town and neighbourhood of Norfolk, and retired again with his people aboard the &s;hips, which were con&s;iderably increa&s;ed in number by tho&s;e which they had found in that port. Many of the friends of government, who were called tories by the other party, thought it prudent with their families to &s;eek the &s;ame &s;helter, whither they al&s;o carried the mo&s;t portable and valuable of their effects. Thus his Lord&s;hip formed a con&s;iderable fleet with re&s;pect to the number of ve&s;&s;els and tonnage, and the&s;e were al|&s;o crowded with people; but the &s;hips were without force, and continued months without hands to navi|gate them. The rebels took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Norfolk, and the fleet removed to a greater di&s;tance. While the&s;e things were carrying on, a &s;cheme had been in agitation for rai&s;ing a con&s;iderable force at the back of the colonies, particularly at Virginia and in the Carolinas, where it was known there were many well affected to the King's government, it was hoped that &s;ome of the Indian nations might be indu|ced to become partles in this de&s;ign; and that thus u|nited, they not only would make &s;uch a diver&s;ion as would greatly alarm and di&s;tre&s;s the rebels, but that they would penetrate &s;o far towards the coa&s;t as to form a communication with Lord Dunmore. This &s;hews how earne&s;t the partizans were in pur&s;uing a fa|vourite &s;cheme, at the expence of honour, truth, ju&s;tice
<PB N="32" REF="32">and mercy. This de&s;ign was framed by one Connel|ly, a native of Penn&s;ylvania, an active, enterpri&s;ing man, who appears to have been well calculated for any enterpri&s;e where villany and intrigue were nece&s;|&s;ary. Lord Dunmore approved of his project, who by this time was ready to gra&s;p at every &s;hadow of an opportunity to gratify his revenge again&s;t the Virgini|ans. Connelly having obtained his Lord&s;hip's appro|bation began and carried on a negociation with the Ohio Indians, and his friends among the back &s;ettlers upon the &s;ubjects. Having, as he imagined, &s;ucceed|ed according to his wi&s;hes, he returned to Lord Dun|more, who &s;ent him with the nece&s;&s;ary credentials to Bo&s;ton where he received a commi&s;&s;ion from Gene|ral Gage to act as Colonel-commandant, with a&s;&s;ur|ances af a&s;&s;i&s;tance and &s;upport, at the time and in the manner appointed. Promi&s;es of this &s;ort were ea&s;ily made, but often when the fulfilment was required difficulties aro&s;e which rendered them totally abor|tive. It was intended according to this &s;cheme, that the garri&s;ons which Great Britain had at Detroit, and &s;ome other parts of the remote back &s;ettlements, with their artillery and ammunition, &s;hould be &s;ub&s;er|vient to this de&s;ign, and the adventurer expected to draw &s;ome a&s;&s;i&s;tance, at lea&s;t of volunteers and offi|cers, from the neare&s;t parts of Canada. He him&s;elf was to grant all commi&s;&s;ions to the officers, and to have the &s;upreme command of the new forces in all things, and as &s;oon as they were in condition he was to penetrate through Virginia to meet Lord Dun|more at a certain time in the month of April, in the neighbourhood of Alexandria, upon the river of Pon|towmac, who was to bring &s;uch a naval force, and o|ther a&s;&s;i&s;tance as was judged nece&s;&s;ary for the pur|po&s;e.
<PB N="33" REF="33">It was al&s;o a part, and no incon&s;iderable one of this &s;cheme, provided it had been &s;ucceeded, to have cut off the communication between the northern and the &s;outhern colonies.</P>
<P>So far had matters &s;ucceeded in idea, and the &s;cheme had &s;omething of a favourable appearance in it; but then it was not yet put in execution, and the practical part of it remained yet to be tried. Con|nolly with his imagination full of new &s;chemes, &s;et out on his expedition, but on his road through Ma|ryland to the &s;cene of action, and when he was &s;o far advanced, that the wor&s;t &s;eemed nearly over, the vi|gilance or &s;u&s;picious temper of one of the commit|tees fru&s;trated all his hopes. He was taken up upon &s;u&s;picion with one of his a&s;&s;ociates who travelled a|long with him, his papers betrayed every thing.&mdash; Among the&s;e was the general &s;cheme of the de&s;ign, a a letter from Lord Dunmore to one of the Indian Chiefs, with &s;uch other authentic te&s;timonies as left nothing to be doubted. The papers were publi&s;hed by the congre&s;s, and the undertakers &s;ent to pri&s;on. As it does not appear that the loyali&s;ts were very le|nient to tho&s;e that differed from them in political opi|nions during the &s;hort time of their &s;uperiority in the county of Norfolk and the adjoining parts, &s;o now upon the turn and change of affairs, the obtaining a plau&s;ible &s;hew of ju&s;tice, under the colour of retalia|tion, afforded &s;uch a favourable opportunity for the practice of &s;everity and the gratification of private pique and natural malignity on the other &s;ide, as it never known to be neglected by any party in &s;i|milar circum&s;tances. For though many had taken &s;helter a-board the &s;hips, a much greater number re|mained behind, &s;ome of them being willing to run a
<PB N="34" REF="34">little danger rather than abandon their property:&mdash; others hoped that their conduct from its moderation would bear an enquiry, and the majority from their having no pro&s;pect of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence if they quitted their homes, and an expectation that their ob&s;curity would &s;ave them from notice. But &s;uch charges of oppre&s;|&s;ion, inju&s;tice, and cruelty were made on both &s;ides as are u&s;ually done in &s;uch ca&s;es.</P>
<P>In the mean time the people in the fleet were di&s;|tre&s;&s;ed for the want of provi&s;ions and nece&s;&s;aries of every &s;ort, and were cut off from every kind of &s;uc|cour on &s;hore. This occa&s;ioned frequent &s;kirmi&s;hes between the armed &s;hips and boats, and the forces that were &s;tationed on the coa&s;t, particularly at Nor|folk. The Liverpool man of war at length arrived from England, a flag was &s;ent a-&s;hore, to put the que&s;|tion whether they would &s;upply his Maje&s;ty's &s;hips with provi&s;ions, which being an&s;wered in the negative and the &s;hips in the harbour being continually annoy|ed by the fire of the rebels from that part of the town that lay next the water, it was determined to de&s;troy it and di&s;lodge them by de&s;troying it. Previous notice being given to the inhabitants that they might remove from the danger, the fir&s;t day of the new year was &s;ignalized by the attack, when a violent cannon|ade from the Liverpool frigate, two &s;loops of war, and the Governor's armed &s;hip the Dunmore, &s;econd|ed by parties of &s;ailors, who landed and &s;et fire to the neare&s;t hou&s;es, &s;oon produced the de&s;ired effect, and the whole troops were reduced to a&s;hes. There were at that time various accounts concerning the burning of Norfolk; the royali&s;ts affirmed that the rebels burnt a great part of it them&s;elves, and they on the other hand throw the whole of the charge upon Lord
<PB N="35" REF="35">Dunmore and the King's friends. From a Gazette publi&s;hed in the Governor's &s;hip, whether he had re|moved the printing pre&s;s, it appears that is was only intended to de&s;troy that part of the town which mo&s;t annoyed the &s;hips, but Lord Dunmore's Gazettes are not to be con&s;idered of much more credit than the accounts of the Virginians. Whoever was the au|thor of this cata&s;trope, it is certain that this town was con&s;umed to a&s;hes in this unfortunate conte&s;t. When a fire is once kindled, it is not ea&s;y to pre&s;cribe li|mits to its progre&s;s, or to determine by what accidents it may be extended beyond the bounds that may be de&s;igned by tho&s;e who kindled it at fir&s;t. On this oc|ca&s;ion a few of tho&s;e who landed were killed, as al&s;o &s;ome of the town&s;men and the provincials.</P>
<P>Such was the fate of the unfortunate town of Nor|folk, the mo&s;t con&s;iderable for commerce of any town in the colony, and &s;o growing and flouri&s;hing was it before the&s;e unhappy troubles, that in the two years from 1773 to 1775, the rents of the hou&s;es encrea&s;ed from 8,000<ABBR>l.</ABBR> to 10,000<ABBR>l.</ABBR> a year.&mdash;The whole lo&s;s was e&s;timated at above 300,000<ABBR>l.</ABBR>&mdash;Though Lord Dunmore might think he had ju&s;t rea&s;ons for what he did on this occa&s;ion, and might probably plead nece&s;|&s;ity for this mea&s;ure, it was undoubtedly a grievous office, as well as an odious ta&s;k to a Governor, to be him&s;elf a principal actor in burning and de&s;troying the be&s;t town in his government. The rebels after this di&s;mal tran&s;action, attempted to cut off every re|&s;ource from the &s;hips, and partly to puni&s;h the friends of government, burnt and de&s;troyed the plantations with inreach of the water, and obliged the people to remove with their cattle, provi&s;ions, and portable ef|fects farther into into the country.</P>
<PB N="36" REF="36">
<P>The &s;ituation of other Governors in America was not more eligible than that of Lord Dunmore.&mdash;Lord William Campbell in South Carolina, having as they &s;aid entered into a negociation with the Indians for coming in to &s;upport government in that province, and having al&s;o &s;ucceeded in exciting a number of tho&s;e back &s;ettlers, who are de&s;tingui&s;hed in the Ca|rolina &s;tile by the name of Regulators, to e&s;pou&s;e the &s;ame cau&s;e, the di&s;covery of tho&s;e mea&s;ures be|fore they were ripe for execution, occa&s;ioned &s;uch a tumult among the people, that he thought it nece&s;&s;ary to retire from Charle&s;town aboard a &s;hip of war in the river, from whence he returned no more to the &s;eat of his government. It is &s;ome what &s;trange that the&s;e Governors &s;hould have had &s;o little regard pay|ed them, and &s;o little authority in the&s;e provinces, as in none of them to have a majority of the people up|on their &s;ide. They mu&s;t certainly have been ex|ceedingly unpopular in former times, and ruled with rigour in their governments, otherwi&s;e it could never have happened that the general voice of the people would have been &s;o univer&s;ally again&s;t them.&mdash;To prevent any ill effects from Campbell's negociation, one Mr Drayton, who was judge of the &s;uperior court and one of the mo&s;t leading men in the colony, march|ed with a &s;trong armed force to the back &s;ettlements, where a treaty was concluded between him and the leaders of the Regulators, in which the differences between them were attributed to mi&s;information and mi&s;under&s;tanding of each others views and de&s;igns, and a tenderne&s;s of con&s;cience on the parts of the lat|ter, which prevented their &s;igning the a&s;&s;ociations, or pur&s;uing any mea&s;ures again&s;t government; but as they were engaged neither by word nor act to im|pede
<PB N="37" REF="37">or contravene &s;uch proceedings as &s;hould be a|dopted and pur&s;ued by the province in general, nor give any information, aid, or a&s;&s;i&s;tance, to any Briti&s;h troops as &s;hould at any time arrive in it; &s;o they were to be entirely free in their conduct, otherwi&s;e to enjoy a &s;afe neutrality, and to &s;uffer no mole&s;tation for their not taking an active part in the pre&s;ent trou|bles. It is probable that the report of Lord William Campbell's misfortune, and the force under Mr Dray|ton, prevailed more with the&s;e Regulators than any principles of ju&s;tice or moderation. They found that their &s;chemes were di&s;covered, and they wanted to colour them in the be&s;t manner they could. It was prudent in Drayton to make this agreement, and thereby free him&s;elf and the colony from a war which mu&s;t have greatly emberra&s;&s;ed them on this oc|ca&s;ion.</P>
<P>The government of the province was now lodged in the council of &s;afety, con&s;i&s;ting of thirteen per&s;ons, with the occa&s;ional a&s;&s;i&s;tance of a committee of ninety one. As they were informed that an armament was preparing in England, which was particularly intend|ed again&s;t the colony, no means were left untried for its defence, in di&s;ciplining the forces, procuring arms and gunpowder, and particularly in fortifying and &s;e|curing Charle&s;town. Similar mea&s;ures were pur&s;ued in North Carolina, with only this difference&mdash;Gover-Martin was more active and vigorous in his proceed|ings, but attended with as little &s;ucce&s;s as the other Governors. The provincial congre&s;s, committees, and governors were in a continued &s;tate of the mo&s;t violent warfare. Upon a number of charges, parti|cularly of fomenting a civil war, and executing an in|&s;urrection among the negroes, he was declared an
<PB N="38" REF="38">enemy to America in general, and to that colony in particular, and all per&s;ons forbidden to hold any com|munication with him. The&s;e declarations he an&s;wer|ed with a proclamation of uncommon length which the provincial congre&s;s re&s;olved to be a fal&s;e, &s;canda|lous, &s;currilous, malicious, and &s;editious libel, and or|dered it to be burnt by the hand of the common hang|man.</P>
<P>The Governor had a palace at New Burn, which he now fortified with an expectation that by means of the back &s;ettlers and the Scotch inhabitants, as well as the Highland emigrants, which were numerous in the province, he would be able to rai&s;e a large force and make a con&s;iderable diver&s;ion. But the watch|ful eye of jealou&s;y which &s;eldom &s;uffers the &s;malle&s;t hints given by an enemy to e&s;cape an interpretation, perceived the de&s;igns of the Governor. Before his de&s;ign could be affected, the moving of &s;ome cannon &s;tirred up &s;uch a commotion among the people, that he found it nece&s;&s;ary to abandon his palace, and to retire a-board a &s;loop of war in Cape Fear river.&mdash; The people upon this occa&s;ion di&s;covered powder, &s;hot, ball, and various military &s;tores and implements that had been buried in the palace, garden, and yards. This &s;erved to inflame them exceedingly, every man con&s;idering it as if it had been a plot again&s;t him&s;elf in particular. In other re&s;pects the province followed the example of their neighbours in South Carolina, by e&s;tabli&s;hing a council and committee of &s;afety, with other &s;ub&s;titutes for a regular and permanent govern|ment. They al&s;o pur&s;ued the &s;ame method of pro|viding for defence, of rai&s;ing, arming, and &s;uporting forces, and of training the militia, and &s;hewed equal vigour and readine&s;s in all their proceedings. The
<PB N="39" REF="39">provincial congre&s;s publi&s;hed an addre&s;s to the inha|bitants, of the &s;ame nature with &s;everal others that have been mentioned, containing the &s;tronge&s;t expre&s;|&s;ions of loyalty and affection, and declaring an earne&s;t de&s;ire of reconciliation. Such were the proceedings in the &s;outhern colonies during this &s;ea&s;on;&mdash;but we mu&s;t now return to the proceedings in Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Bay, and particularly of the armies in and about Bo&s;|ton.</P>
<P>General Gage having returned to England the be|ginning of October, the command in chief devolved upon General Howe.&mdash;This officer &s;oon after his taking upon him the command i&s;&s;ued a proclamation, by which &s;uch of the inhabitants as attempted to quit the town without licence, were condemned to mili|tary execution, if detected and taken, and if they e&s;caped, to be proceeded again&s;t as traitors, and their effects to be forfeited.&mdash;By another proclamation, &s;uch as obtained permi&s;&s;ion to leave the town, were by &s;evere penalties excluded from carrying more than a &s;mall &s;pecified &s;um of money along with them. He al&s;o enjoined &s;igning and entering into an a&s;&s;ociation, by which the remaining inhabitants offered their per|&s;ons for the defence of the town, and &s;uch of them as he approved of were to be armed, formed into companies, and were to be in&s;tructed in military ex|erci&s;es and di&s;cipline, the remainder being obliged to pay their quotas in money towards the common de|fence.</P>
<P>The limited time for which the &s;oldiers in the pro|vincial army before Bo&s;ton were inli&s;ted, was near a|bout expired, and it was nece&s;&s;ary that &s;ome mea&s;ures &s;hould be taken for &s;upplying their place. A com|mitte of the general congre&s;s, con&s;i&s;ting of &s;ome of
<PB N="40" REF="40">the mo&s;t re&s;pectable members, were &s;ent thither to take the nece&s;&s;ary mea&s;ures, in conjunction with Ge|neral Wa&s;hington, for keeping it from di&s;banding.&mdash; This was a work of &s;mall difficulty, for the whole ar|my enli&s;ted for an year to come, for certain. Of all the difficulties which the Americans met in attempts towards e&s;tabli&s;hing a military force, nothing affected them &s;o grievou&s;ly, or was &s;o hard to remedy as gun|powder. For though they u&s;ed the utmo&s;t diligence in collecting nitre, and all the other parts of the manufacture, the re&s;ource from their indu&s;try was &s;low and with regard to any con&s;iderable effect it was di&s;|tant. They had not yet opened that commerce, nor entered into tho&s;e mea&s;ures with foreign &s;tates, which have &s;ince procured them a &s;upply of military &s;tores. The &s;carcity of powder was &s;o great, that it was &s;aid the troops at Bunkers-hill had not a &s;ingle charge left at the end of that &s;hort engagement; and it is al&s;o &s;aid by &s;ome that the weakne&s;s of the army before Bo&s;|ton in that re&s;pect was at one time &s;o great, that no|thing but General Howe's ignorance of that circum|&s;tance could have &s;aved them from being di&s;per&s;ed and ruined. They left nothing undone to &s;upply that defect, and among other temporary expedients had contrived to purcha&s;e without notice or &s;u&s;picion all the powder upon the African coa&s;t, and plundered the magazines in the i&s;land of Burmuda of about 100 barrels, which was carried off, as was pretended, without the knowledge of the inhabitants.</P>
<P>While plundering, threatening, and ho&s;tility was con&s;tantly carried on upon the &s;ea coa&s;t, the town of of Falmouth in the northern part of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Bay, was doomed to &s;hare in the calamities which were di&s;pen&s;ed to Norfolk in Virginia, upon October 18,
<PB N="41" REF="41">on account of &s;ome violence or mi&s;behaviour relative to the loading of a ma&s;t &s;hip, drew the vengeance of the Admiral in that &s;tation upon this devoted place, and occa&s;ioned an order for its de&s;truction.</P>
<P>The officers who commanded the &s;hips upon that occa&s;ion, gave two hours previous notice to the inha|bitants to provide for their &s;afety, and this time was further enlarged till next morning, under the cover of a negociation for delivering their artillery and &s;mall arms at the price of &s;aving the town. This however they refu&s;ed to comply with, but had made u&s;e of the intermediate time in removing as many of their effects as they could procure carriages for, or as the darkne&s;s and the confu&s;ion of the night would admit.</P>
<P>About nine o'clock in the morning a cannonade was begun and continued with little intermi&s;&s;ion thro' the day. Above 3000 &s;hot, be&s;ides bombs and car|ca&s;es, were thrown into the town, and the &s;ailors landed to compleat the de&s;truction, but were repul|&s;ed with the lo&s;s of a few men. The principal part of the town which lay next the water, con&s;i&s;ting of a|bout 130 dwelling hou&s;es, 278 &s;tores, and warehou&s;es, with a large new church, a new hand&s;ome court hou&s;e, with the public library, were reduced to a&s;hes; about 100 of the wor&s;t hou&s;es being favoured by their &s;ituation and di&s;tance, e&s;caped de&s;truction, though not without damage. Tho' the &s;ettlements in this quar|ter were new, being mo&s;tly e&s;tabli&s;hed &s;ince the la&s;t war, this &s;mall town was amazingly thriving, being &s;ituated on a fine harbour, and having a very con&s;ider|able trade, &s;o that it was computed to contain about 600 families, though little more than one-third of that number of dwelling-hou&s;es. The burning of church|es and libraries is a new &s;pecies of warfare, left to
<PB N="42" REF="42">the improvement of this polite age to be practi&s;ed by a people who boa&s;t of their civilization, humanity and politene&s;s. In the mo&s;t barbarous ages, churches, colleges, and &s;eminaries of learning, were held &s;acred by all parties, and it was never known, that either in the civil wars or in any foreign ones that Engli&s;hmen waged war with learning and religion. This &s;pecies of warfare was left to di&s;grace the pre&s;ent age, and to be handed down as a reproach to the government of Britain to the late&s;t po&s;terity.</P>
<P>The de&s;truction of Falmouth provoked the congre&s;s to the la&s;t degree, and probably pu&s;hed on the a&s;|&s;embly of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Bay to the daring mea&s;ure of granting letters of marque and repri&s;als, and e&s;tabli&s;h|ing courts of admiralty for the trial and condemnation of Briti&s;h &s;hips. In this law they declare an intention of only defending the coa&s;ts and navigation of Ame|rica, extending the power of capture only to &s;uch &s;hips as &s;hould be employed in bringing &s;upplies to the armies employed again&s;t them. From this time they did all that was in their power to &s;eize &s;uch &s;hips as brought &s;upplies to the troops.</P>
<P>During the cour&s;e of the &s;ummer, articles of confe|deration and perpetual union between the &s;everal co|lonies which were already a&s;&s;ociated, with liberty of admi&s;&s;ion to tho&s;e of Quebec, St. John's, Nova Sco|tia, the two Floridas and Bermudas, containing rules then general government in peace and war, both with re&s;pect to foreigners and each other, were drawn up by the general congre&s;s, and by them tran&s;mitted to their different colonies for the in&s;pection and con&s;ider|ation of their re&s;pective a&s;&s;emblies. If the&s;e articles met with their approbation, they were to empower their delegates to the en&s;uing congre&s;s to ratify and
<PB N="43" REF="43">confirm them; and from that time the union which they e&s;tabli&s;hed was to continue firm until, be&s;ides a redre&s;s of grievances, reparation was made for the lo&s;&s;es &s;u&s;tained by Bo&s;ton, for the burning of Charles|town, for the expences of the war; and until the Bri|ti&s;h troops were withdrawn from America:&mdash;When the&s;e events &s;hould take place, the colonies were to return to their former connections and friend&s;hip with Great Britain; but on failure therof, the confedera|tion was to be perpetual.</P>
<P>The people in general were not however &s;uffici|ently provoked, nor their affections and prejudices &s;ufficiently broken, to accede to a confederacy, tho' conditionally framed and worded, which yet led to a total &s;eparation from the mother country. For tho' they had taken up arms, and oppo&s;ed the government, yet &s;till it was general, under the hope of obtaining thereby a redre&s;s of grievances; and that being the more near and agreeable object, they would not wil|lingly look to any thing further, e&s;pecially to one &s;o dreadful as a total &s;eparation. It required more time in the contemplation of real or &s;uppo&s;ed injuries, and in &s;peculation upon future ones, together with fre&s;h and con&s;tant &s;ources of irritation, to arrive at that habit of hatred and vexation, which was nece&s;&s;ary to break ties of &s;o long a continuance, to render &s;o new an idea familiar.</P>
<P>When the autumn approached, and appearances of plenty gave the coloni&s;ts grounds to conjecture what might be &s;pared out of the abundance of a plentiful harve&s;t, it was re&s;olved by the congre&s;s that if the late re&s;training laws were not repealed within &s;ix months from the 20th of July, on which they commanded that the cu&s;tom-hou&s;e &s;hould be every where &s;hut up, and
<PB N="44" REF="44">their ports from that time be open to every &s;tate in Europe which would admit and protect their com|merce, free of all duties, and for every kind of com|modity excepting only teas and the merchandize of Great Britain and her dependencies. And the more to encourage foreigners to engage to trade with them, they pa&s;&s;ed a re&s;olution that they would to the utmo&s;t of their power maintain and &s;upport &s;uch free|dom of commerce for two years certain, after its com|mencement, notwith&s;tanding any reconciliation with Great Britain, and as much longer as the pre&s;ent ob|noxious laws &s;hould continue. They al&s;o immedi|ately &s;u&s;pended the non-importation agreement in favour of all &s;hips that &s;hould bring gunpowder, ni|tre, &s;ulphur, good mu&s;quets fitted with bayonets, or bra&s;s field pieces, &s;uch &s;hips to be deducted in return with the full value of their cargoes.</P>
<P>About the clo&s;e of the year, the general congre&s;s publi&s;hed a declaration as an an&s;wer to the royal pro|clamation, for &s;uppre&s;&s;ing rebellion and &s;edition, which was i&s;&s;ued at St. James's on the twenty-third of Au|gu&s;t. In this declaration they denied the charges of forgetting their allegiance, of trea&s;on and rebellion, and took particular notice of the dangerous tenden|cy and indi&s;criminate nature of a clau&s;e prohibiting under the &s;evere&s;t penalties the carrying on of any corre&s;pondence from England with any per&s;ons in rebellion, or the aiding or abetting of &s;uch. But not content with critical ob&s;ervations, they conclude with a declaration in name of the people of the unit|ed colonies, that whatever puni&s;hment &s;hall be in|flicted upon any per&s;on in the power of their ene|mies, for favouring, aiding or abetting the cau&s;e of American liberty, &s;hould be retaliated in the &s;ame
<PB N="45" REF="45">kind and the &s;ame degree upon the&s;e in their power, who have favoured, aided or abetted, or &s;hould fa|vour or abet the &s;y&s;tem of mini&s;terial oppre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>We &s;hall leave for a while the political manaeuvres of both &s;ides, and give a more particular account of the armies within and about Bo&s;ton.</P>
<P>By the delays and misfortunes which the tran&s;ports and victuallers from England and Ireland experi|enced, our forces in Bo&s;ton were reduced to great di&s;|tre&s;s. What added to the&s;e afflictions which they al|ready &s;uffered, was the mortification that they had of &s;eeing &s;everal ve&s;&s;els which were laden with nece&s;&s;aries and comforts of life, taken in the very entrance of the harbour; whil&s;t different circum&s;tances of tide, wind, or &s;ituation, di&s;abled the &s;hips of war from pre|venting the mi&s;chief. The lo&s;s of mo&s;t of the coal &s;hips was &s;everely felt, as fewel could not be procur|ed, and the climate rendered that article indi&s;pen&s;ible. The mi&s;erable inhabitants were &s;till in a more deplor|able condition. Detained again&s;t their will, cut off from all intercourse with their friends, expo&s;ed to all the consequences of that contempt and aver&s;ion, with which a great part of them were regarded by the &s;ol|diers, and at the &s;ame time in want of every nece&s;&s;ary of life. Grievous however as this &s;ituation was it &s;erved as a &s;ort of refuge to tho&s;e who were either zealous in favour of the king's government, or &s;o di&s;|&s;atisfied with the new &s;tate of things that they could no longer live with comfort, &s;ome of them hardly with &s;afety in their own homes.</P>
<P>It was now greatly dreaded that the military &s;tores would fail, and &s;alt provi&s;ions at la&s;t grew &s;carce.&mdash; The troops at Bunkers-hill &s;uffered great hard&s;hips, being obliged to lye in tents all the winter under the
<PB N="46" REF="46">driving &s;nows, and expo&s;ed to the almo&s;t intolerable winds of the climate in that &s;ea&s;on, with which the &s;trict and con&s;tant duty occa&s;ioned by the &s;trength and nearne&s;s of the enemy, rendered that &s;ervice exceed|ingly &s;evere both to the private men and the officers. Many and various attempts were made to remedy and le&s;&s;en &s;ome of the wants that now prevailed in the ar|my. That of firing, which was mo&s;t immediately and tolerably pre&s;&s;ing, was in &s;ome mea&s;ure relieved by the de&s;truction of hou&s;es. It mu&s;t undoubtedly have been a bitter reflection to men of any feelings to think of the cau&s;e of pulling down the dwellings and habit|ations of their own brethren and friends to &s;upply the nece&s;&s;ity of wants created by yielding obedience to an authority to which the con&s;titution never had nor could give any &s;anction. Severe afflictions brought on in the cour&s;e of providence, in which men have them&s;elves no active hand, may be borne with patience and fortitude, in hopes of better things; but when men ru&s;h wilfully into mi&s;eries, by pur&s;uing either doubtful or manife&s;tedly bad mea&s;ures, reflection adds much to their &s;ufferings. The commander in chief, who had in the Briti&s;h &s;enate declared his opinion con|cerning this unju&s;t and ruinous war, could not but feel the pangs of remor&s;e, in now being a chief agent in bringing mi&s;eries both upon him&s;elf and his fellow &s;ubjects. When the ideas of honour and heroi&s;m are directly oppo&s;ed to ju&s;tice and con&s;cience, they will be found wanting in their influence to &s;upport a man in extreme di&s;tre&s;s, provided he has the &s;malle&s;t degree of &s;en&s;ibility.</P>
<P>The attempts made to procure provi&s;ions were not attended with great &s;ucce&s;s. Some ve&s;&s;els were &s;ent to Barbadoes to procure what could be had of &s;uch
<PB N="47" REF="47">nece&s;&s;aries as the i&s;land afforded, and by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Governor a very moderate quantity was ob|tained; and it was &s;uppo&s;ed, and not without rea&s;on, that had the matter been fully known, they would not have &s;ucceeded &s;o well as they did. The&s;e i&s;land|ers being now cut off from their u&s;ual re&s;ources, and having, as they &s;aid, a famine &s;taring them in the face, with 80,000 blacks and 20,000 white people to feed, and no &s;ufficient &s;tock in hand, nor any cer|tain &s;upply in pro&s;pect, could not be &s;uppo&s;ed to &s;pare much for the relief of the army at Bo&s;ton. The con|duct of the Governor was loudly complained of, and occa&s;ioned a direct addre&s;s to the King from the a&s;|&s;embly, &s;etting forth in a detail their own melancho|ly &s;ituation, and imprudence of the conduct of the Governor.</P>
<P>As nece&s;&s;ity is one of tho&s;e laws which rou&s;es the human faculties to invention, and makes men try every po&s;&s;ible mea&s;ure to relieve them&s;elves, another &s;cheme was fallen upon to &s;upply the troops with provi&s;ions and nece&s;&s;aries. A detachment of marines, with an armed &s;hip, and &s;ome tran&s;ports, were &s;ent to Sa|vannah in Georgia, with a view as the event &s;eemed, to declare off obtaining cargoes of rice and other pro|vi&s;ions, whether by force or otherwi&s;e. The militia therefore however took to their arms, and would not permit them to land, nor the &s;hips to hold any corre|&s;pondence with the &s;hore. In the cour&s;e of the de|bate which aro&s;e upon this occa&s;ion, &s;ome officers belonging to the colony were &s;eized and detained on board the &s;hips, and their relea&s;e being haughtily re|fu&s;ed, and other provoking circum&s;tances occurring on both &s;ides, &s;ome batteries were &s;peedily erected by the militia, on the banks of the river, and an engagement
<PB N="48" REF="48">with cannon and &s;mall arms took place, in which &s;ome blood was &s;pilt, and &s;even loaded ve&s;&s;els belonging to the colony, and which the commanders of the King's armed ve&s;&s;els by &s;ome collu&s;ions which the captains and owners, had got po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of, and who&s;e cargoes would have effectually an&s;wered their purpo&s;e, were de&s;ignedly burnt in the conflict.</P>
<P>In this &s;tate of matters with the King's forces the provincials before Bo&s;ton were well covered, and well &s;upported in their lines. They waited with the great|e&s;t anxiety the &s;etting in of the fro&s;t, which in that part of the world &s;ets in about Chri&s;tmas, and gene|rally covers the harbour and all the adjoining rivers and creeks with a &s;urface of &s;olid ice. They found|ed their great hopes upon this as a mo&s;t powerful a&s;|&s;i&s;tant, by who&s;e aid they had not only extended their views to the recovery of the town, but to the &s;eizure and de&s;truction of the fleet, as well as of the land for|ces.</P>
<P>The openne&s;s and mildne&s;s of the winter di&s;appoint|ed tho&s;e &s;anguine hopes; for the weather was uncom|monly mild, and the fro&s;ts had none of tho&s;e effects which they &s;anguinely expected. Their expectation probably had &s;ome influence upon their operations, and their continuing more quiet than they otherwi&s;e would have done. The arrival of a copy of the King's &s;peech, with an accaunt of the fate of the petition from the continental congre&s;s, is reported to have ex|cited the greate&s;t degree of rage and indignation a|mong&s;t them; as an evidence of their indignation, they burnt his Maje&s;ty's &s;peech publicly in the camp, and on this occa&s;ion they changed their colours from a plain red ground which they had hitherto u&s;ed, to a flag with thirteen &s;tripes, as a &s;ymbol of the union and number of the colonies.</P>

<P>Some ve&s;&s;els at length arrived at Bo&s;ton from Bri|tain and Ireland, which in &s;ome mea&s;ure alleviated the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of the King's forces in the town and the camp; and though the winter was not &s;o &s;evere as to an&s;wer the expectations of the provincials, the climate had &s;o much influence as to make both parties fond of their ea&s;e, to check the &s;pirit of enterpri&s;e, and to prevent the effu&s;ion of blood: &s;o that for near three months a great quiet prevailed.</P>
<P>During this &s;tate of affairs, the American cruizers and privateers, though exceedingly poor and con|temptible, being for mo&s;t part no better than whale boats, grew daily more numerous and &s;ucce&s;sful a|gain&s;t the tran&s;ports and &s;tore &s;hips, and among a multitude of other prizes had the fortune of taking one which gave a new colour to their military opera|tions. This was an ordnance &s;hip from Woolwich, which had &s;eparated from her convoy, and being her&s;elf of no force, was taken without defence by a &s;mall privateer. This ve&s;&s;el contained, be&s;ides a &s;mall mortar upon a new con&s;truction, &s;everal pieces of fine bra&s;s cannon, a large quantity of &s;mall arms and ammunition, with all manner of tools, uten&s;ils and machines nece&s;&s;ary for camps, and artillery in the greate&s;t abundance. The lo&s;s of this &s;hip was much re&s;ented in England, and occa&s;ioned &s;ome &s;evere re|flections upon the admiralty, both within and with|out doors; for hazarding a cargo of &s;uch value and importance in a defencele&s;s ve&s;&s;el. This &s;hip and cargo gave new &s;trength to the provincials, and fur|ni&s;hed them with many things they &s;tood much in need of. Be&s;ides it gave them fre&s;h &s;pirits when they perceived what they could do by properly ex|erting their &s;trength, and the natural powers and op|portunities
<PB N="50" REF="51">which providence had given them. The&s;e &s;ucce&s;&s;es by &s;ea made them more attentive, and cau&s;|ed them in all quarters to keep a &s;harp look out, while the Kings fleet were through nece&s;&s;ity confined in the harbour of Bo&s;ton. It indeed highly provoked and chagrined the army in the town and on Bunker's-hill, to &s;ee provi&s;ion and other nece&s;&s;aries ju&s;t &s;natch|ed from them before their eyes, and when their hopes were at the height of expectation of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing them. Notwith&s;tanding of the&s;e &s;evere di&s;appointments, the town and camp remained quiet and unmole&s;ted by the enemy until the end of February.</P>
<P>When all things &s;eemed in a perfect calm on both &s;ides, the tranquility of Bo&s;ton was on the beginning of March unexpectedly di&s;turbed by &s;ome &s;udden and unexpected movements on the &s;ide of the coloni&s;ts.&mdash; This was &s;aid to be occa&s;ioned by the congre&s;s re|ceiving intelligence of the prohibitary acts, and of hiring of foreign troops; upon this information, they immediately di&s;patched in&s;tructions to General Wa&s;h|ington, totally to change the mode of carrying on the war, and to bring the affair at Bo&s;ton to the &s;peedie&s;t deci&s;ion that was po&s;&s;ible, in order that the army might be di&s;engaged, and at liberty to oppo&s;e the new dangers with which they were threatened. Whatever might be the rea&s;ons of this &s;udden altera|tion of affairs, a battery was opened at a place called Phips's Farm, near the &s;ide of the water, on the night of the &s;econd of March, from whence a &s;evere bom|bardment and cannonade was carried on again&s;t the town, and repeated on the en&s;uing nights. This greatly alarmed the army in the town, and all hands were bu&s;ily employed in quenching fires, and extin|gui&s;hing the flames of hou&s;es, the u&s;ual attendants of
<PB N="51" REF="52">&s;uch an attack. While they were employed in this &s;ort of exerci&s;e, they &s;aw with inexpre&s;&s;ible &s;urpri&s;e on the morning of the 5th of March &s;ome con&s;ider|able works appear on the other &s;ide of the town up|on the heights of Dorche&s;ter point, which had been erected in the preceding night, and from whence a twenty-four pounder and a bomb battery were &s;oon after opened. Some Briti&s;h officers that were pre|&s;ent confe&s;&s;ed that the expedition with which the&s;e works were thrown up with their &s;udden and unex|pected appearance, recalled to their minds tho&s;e won|derful &s;tories of inchantment and invi&s;ible agency, which are &s;o frequent in the Ea&s;tern romances.&mdash; They were ready to imagine that they had got into fairy land, where &s;piritual agency is &s;uppo&s;ed to &s;up|ply the place of bodily exertions. They could not however but con&s;ider, that they were now dealing with a people that were in earne&s;t, and who were not inferior to them&s;elves in indu&s;try, to &s;upport the cau&s;e they were engaged in. Both the art and in|du&s;try of the coloni&s;ts began now to be alarming to our troops; they perceived that the men whom they had been taught to de&s;pi&s;e as cowards and poltroons, were now their equals, if not their &s;uperiors, both in application and intrepidity. The &s;ituation of our ar|my was now very critical. The new works, along with tho&s;e other which it is evident would be &s;peed|ily con&s;tructed on &s;ome neighbouring hills, would command the town and a con&s;iderable part of the harbour and beach, from whence an embarkation mu&s;t take place in the event of a retreat, and render the communication between the troops in the works at Bo&s;ton neck and the main body, difficult and dan|gerous.</P>
<PB N="52" REF="53">
<P>In the&s;e circum&s;tances no alternative remained but to abandon the town, or di&s;lodge the enemy, and de|&s;troy the new works. General Howe adopted the latter, and took the nece&s;&s;ary mea&s;ures for the em|barkation on that very evening for five regiments, with the light infantry and grenadiers, upon a &s;ervice which the whole army mu&s;t of cour&s;e have ultimately been engaged in. Providence at this time fru&s;trated the de&s;igns of the General, and probably for his own good, for had he proceeded to attack the work it is not improbable that his whole army would have been ruined. The provincials were eager for a battle, and they were provided for an attack, and would have made &s;uch a re&s;i&s;tance as would have been fatal to our army.</P>
<P>This de&s;ign was fru&s;trated by a violent &s;torm, which raged that night, and rendered an embarka|tion impo&s;&s;ible, and &s;o &s;aved the lives of many brave men, which mu&s;t have fallen in &s;uch a ra&s;h encounter. &mdash;Whatever intrepedity there might be in General Howe's intention on this occa&s;ion, it does not appear that his purpo&s;e was dictated by wi&s;dom; for before he had &s;tormed the works of the enemy, his army mu&s;t have been greatly thinned, and the coloni&s;ts were likely after that to have &s;tood their ground, and to have di&s;puted every inch with his Excellency for the palm of victory. Bunker's-hill might have taught the General what the provincials could do, even when they were but indifferently armed, and ill provided with ammunition, and now that they were greatly reinforced and &s;upplied with &s;tores, arms, and ammunition of all &s;orts, they were not likely to give way &s;o ea&s;ily, but to u&s;e their utmo&s;t power to be revenged upon men whom they con&s;idered as in|vaders
<PB N="53" REF="54">of their country, and murderers of their friends. The General's &s;cheme was the very &s;cheme the co|loni&s;ts wanted him to pur&s;ue, and had he pur&s;ued his de&s;ign, his whole army mu&s;t have been cut off.</P>
<P>It is not however to be wondered at, that with an high &s;en&s;e of the Briti&s;h military honour, as well as of his own, the General &s;hould hazard much rather than &s;ubmit to the indignity of abandoning the town. He commanded a force which he knew had been con&s;i|dered and repre&s;ented here as &s;ufficient to look down all the oppo&s;ition in America; and which in reality with re&s;pect to the number of regiments, if not of men, the excellency of the troops, the character of the of|ficers, and the powerful artillery which they po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ed, would have been re&s;pectable in any country, and dangerous to any enemy. With &s;uch troops to give up that town which had been the original cau&s;e of the war, and the con&s;tant object of contention &s;ince it commenced, to a raw and undi&s;ciplined militia, &s;eemed exclu&s;ive of all other ill con&s;equences, a di&s;grace not to be borne. But the&s;e brave men had by a variety of events, and perhaps it will be thought, and not without good rea&s;on, through original error and mi&s;|conduct in the arrangement of the war, been reduced to &s;uch circum&s;tances, and hedged in in &s;uch a man|ner, that no means were left for an exertion of their force and courage; that they were now &s;ubject to the greate&s;t danger, without affording any pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s. The wild roda montade of Briti&s;h va|lour which had been re&s;ounded through all corners of the empire were now proved to be only empty &s;ounds without any meaning, for tho' Briti&s;h troops will fight as well as any others, when under a proper influence, yet there is nothing in either the men or
<PB N="54" REF="55">the country that gives a ulaim to an exclu&s;ive mono|poly of bravery. They were now fighting with their own countrymen, animated with the &s;trong in&s;piring &s;pirit of liberty, with all that is dear to mankind at the point of their &s;words, and not with men who were fighting for the honour of a grand monarch, who&s;e in|tere&s;t and theirs are very different. Though the idea of military glory may in&s;pire &s;ome officers that have &s;uffered their minds to roam in the field of ro|mance, and have through an habit of thinking wrought up their minds to think it a glory to die in battle, yet the common &s;oldiers are not acquainted with &s;uch refinement, but both feel and fear natural evils, e&s;pecially when their con&s;ciences hint to them &s;ome doubt concerning the ju&s;tice of the cau&s;e of a war.</P>
<P>Fortune, or in better phra&s;e providence, prevented the perilous trial which the General propo&s;ed. On the day that &s;ucceeded the tempe&s;t the de&s;ign was re&s;umed; but on a clo&s;er in&s;pection new difficulties aro&s;e: it was di&s;covered that a new work had been thrown up which was much &s;tronger than any of the former, and that the whole were now &s;o compleatly fortified, that all hopes of forcing them was at an end. It now al&s;o became evident that Bo&s;ton was not a place very happily cho&s;en for the improvement of any advantage which might be obtained towards the re|duction of the colonies. This was fore&s;een by many from the beginning, but the mini&s;try who were &s;o &s;ure of conquering the coloni&s;ts with a few grenadiers and red coats, thought all places equally ea&s;ily &s;ubdued. It was an infatuation which from the beginning of this ruinous war had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed all its friends, that they have always boa&s;ted of their own &s;trength and
<PB N="55" REF="56">de&s;pi&s;ed their enemies; from the meane&s;t court toad-eater to the mini&s;ter him&s;elf, nothing was ever to be heard but the &s;ounds of the victory, valour, and intre|pidity of the Briti&s;h troops; when after all, every year has been attended with repeated lo&s;&s;es, di&s;ap|pointment, and di&s;grace. People that think gravely, and believe in providence, have all along inferred, that there has been &s;omething of a divine hand in our pre&s;ent di&s;a&s;ters, and that the national infidelity and wickedne&s;s has had a great &s;hare in our misfortunes, while others reciprocate the blame upon each other, and endeavour to clear them&s;elves of having an hand in the mi&s;management, but have done every thing for the be&s;t. In ages pa&s;t, which we, now turned a po|lite people, call barbarous, it was always the fa&s;hion in going to war to con&s;ider providence as the be&s;t al|ly, and for that rea&s;on our fathers &s;eldom neglected to u&s;e the proper means to procure the a&s;&s;i&s;tance there|of, but this is now accounted a weakne&s;s and imbe|cility of mind, unworthy of an enlightened age.</P>
<P>Upon viewing the &s;ituation of the rebels, and the re&s;olution which they &s;hewed to make a vigorous re|&s;i&s;tance, if not a bold attack upon our men, nothing remained but to abandon the town, and to convey the troops, artillery, and &s;tores, aboard the &s;hips. This la&s;t re&s;ort was not free of difficulty. This part of the hi&s;tory of the war is very differently repre&s;ented. Government writers affirm that the enemy remained quiet during the time of the embarkation, and made not the &s;malle&s;t attempt to give the troops any di&s;tur|bance, while others, and &s;ome who were pre&s;ent wit|ne&s;&s;es and had a &s;hare of the di&s;a&s;ter, have affirmed that our troops &s;uffered prodigiou&s;ly by an heavy fire from the provincials, owing as they affirm to a breach of
<PB N="56" REF="57">agreement on the part of General Howe, who had engaged with Wa&s;hington to remove peaceably, and not de&s;troy any of the &s;tores which he did not carry away, nor touch the works and fortifications of the town. This agreement was broken by the Engli&s;h General, it is &s;aid, upon which the enemy opened their batteries upon our men, and de&s;troyed many of them in the embarkation. This can hardly be believ|ed of General Howe, who is a man of honour and ve|racity, and mu&s;t certainly have proceeded from &s;ome other cau&s;e. The mini&s;try have declared that there was not any convention or agreement between the two Generals, though it has been generally under|&s;tood that the &s;aving of the town depended upon &s;ome &s;ort of convention between them. It is not very pro|bable that the Engli&s;h troops would have left Bo&s;ton without demoli&s;hing it, had there not been &s;ome pro|mi&s;e made on both &s;ides for this purpo&s;e. Had the troops &s;et fire to the town before the embarkation, the provincials would have attacked them with all their force, and probably have ruined the whole ar|my, but as they did not &s;tir at the fir&s;t till the embark|ation was almo&s;t fini&s;hed, it gives rea&s;on to conclude than there was &s;ome agreement which &s;ome of the &s;oldiers might break through, when they thought they were nearly &s;afe from the attack of their enemy.&mdash; This might happen without the General's knowledge. That there was a de&s;ign of burning the the town, is confirmed from combu&s;tibles being laid, and ready for firing in different parts of the town, and that the &s;elect men were permitted to go out and hold a conference with General Wa&s;hington upon the &s;ubject. This &s;eems not to have been contradicted on either hand.</P>
<PB N="57" REF="58">
<P>Notwith&s;tanding all the &s;ecurity that was taken, the embarkation could not be regulated as could have been wi&s;hed, though ten days were &s;pent in the carrying it into execution; many di&s;orders and &s;ome lo&s;s happened through ha&s;te, precipitation, and hurry. It re&s;embled more the emigration of a nation, and the breaking up of a camp, than a &s;imple embarkation.&mdash; Fifteen hundred of the inhabitants, who&s;e attachment to the royal cau&s;e had rendered them obnoxious to their countrymen, incumbered the tran&s;ports with their families and effects. The officers were great &s;ufferers on this occa&s;ion; they had laid out their mo|ney upon furniture and &s;uch other coveniences as were nece&s;&s;ary to render their &s;ituation agreeable, but no purcha&s;ers could be found for the&s;e effects, and it would have been extreme cruelty to many of them to have been under the nece&s;&s;ity of leaving their whole &s;ub&s;tance behind them. The &s;oldiers were em|barra&s;&s;ed with continual duty, and all carriages and labour that could be procured in the town were of cour&s;e monopolized by the emigrant inhabitants.&mdash; Every per&s;on had &s;ome private concern which was &s;ufficient to employ his time and thoughts. The &s;ick and wounded, women and children, called for every care and attention; and of cour&s;e encrea&s;ed the em|bara&s;sment and di&s;tre&s;s. It will be ea&s;y to &s;uppo&s;e &s;ome part of the confu&s;ion incident to &s;uch circum|&s;tances.</P>
<P>The General was in a pitiable &s;ituation; but he bore it with great fortitude, and conducted the whole with great temper and addre&s;s. Some di&s;con|tents appeared, which were to be endured and allay|ed. Scarcity of provi&s;ions and ill &s;ucce&s;s always breed di&s;contents in camps, and as many, both officers and
<PB N="58" REF="59">&s;oldiers, were not altogether hearty in the war, they were on that account more ready to complain. This was in &s;ome mea&s;ure the ca&s;e on this occa&s;ion. The General having received no advices from England, &s;ince the preceding month of October, they con&s;ider|ed them&s;elves in a great mea&s;ure abandoned, and left to extricate them&s;elves as they could out of the unfortunate &s;ituation in which they were involved.&mdash; Mutual di&s;contents and jealou&s;ies prevailed between the army and navy; each attributing to the other the cau&s;e of &s;ome part of that unea&s;ine&s;s it&s;elf felt. Di&s;|contents are exceedingly fruitful; one generates many others in a very &s;hort &s;pace of time. The intended voyage to Halifax was &s;ubject to circum&s;tances of a very alarming nature. The coa&s;t which is at all times dangerous, was dreadfully &s;o at this tempe&s;tuous e|quinoxial &s;ea&s;on, and the multitude of &s;hips, which amounted to 150, increa&s;ed the difficulties and appre|hen&s;ion. As the high north ea&s;t winds now prevailed, they were al&s;o liable to be blown off to the We&s;t In|dies, without a &s;tock of provi&s;ions in any degree &s;uffi|cient to &s;ub&s;i&s;t them in &s;uch a pa&s;&s;age. And what rendered matters &s;till more irk&s;ome, they were going to a barren mi&s;erable country, which was incapable of affording tho&s;e reliefs which they &s;o much wanted. It could not e&s;cape the ob&s;ervation, and was highly vexing to the military, that all this dangerous voyage when compleated, was directly &s;o much out of their way. They were going to the northern extremities of the continent, when their bu&s;ine&s;s lay in the &s;outh|ern, or at lea&s;t about the centre.</P>
<P>The nece&s;&s;ity of their pre&s;ent &s;ituation, left no choice of mea&s;ures, and regret was u&s;ele&s;s. Upon March 17, as the rear embarked, General Wa&s;hing|ton marched into the town with drums beating, colours
<PB N="59" REF="60">flying, and in all the triumph of victory. And indeed it was a compleat victory for the pre&s;ent, &s;ee|ing he had made troops that were reckoned invinci|ble, abandon a town which they had fortified as well as they could, with all the precipitation that u&s;ually happens in &s;ignal defeats. The evacuation of Bo&s;ton which in the &s;tile of the day was called only a change o$ po&s;ition, was certainly a flight under as great ap|prehen&s;ions of fear and de&s;truction as ever happened to any army. The marks of fear and hurry were vi|&s;ible in what they left behind them. They left a con|&s;iderable quantity of artillery and &s;tores upon Bunker-hill and Bo&s;ton-neck, which they had not time to car|ry off, through hurry and fear; and though they at|tempted to render the cannon un&s;erviceable, the hur|ry which then prevailed prevented that de&s;ign.&mdash; They threw &s;ome mortars and cannon unto the wa|ter, which were afterwards weighed by the people of the town. But all circum&s;tances concur to &s;hew what influence panic and dread had upon them in the embarkation.</P>
<P>When General Wa&s;hington entered the town, he was received by the remaining inhabitants, and ac|knowledged by the refugees, who now recovered their ancient po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion with every mark of gratitude and re&s;pect that could be po&s;&s;ibly &s;hewn to a deliver|er. The a&s;&s;embly of the province were not le&s;s zeal|ous in their public acknowledgements. His an&s;wer was proper, mode&s;t, and becoming his &s;ituation.&mdash; He &s;poke like a man that did not pur&s;ue vain glory, but &s;ought the welfare of his country, and maintained the natural rights of mankind. The policy of Bri|tain had made him a rebel, but his country looked up|on him as a &s;aviour and deliverer. What is the genu|ine
<PB N="60" REF="61">character of the parties concerned, time and after ages will declare better than the pre&s;ent can do.</P>
<P>Thus was the long conte&s;ted town of Bo&s;ton at length given up the colony of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ett's-bay freed from a war, and left at liberty to adopt every mea&s;ure which could tend to its future &s;trength and &s;ecurity. It was above a week before the weather permitted the fleet to get clearly out of the harbour and road; but they were afterwards well compen&s;ated in their pa&s;&s;age, their voyage to Hallifax being &s;horter and more happy than could have been rea&s;onably expect|ed. Several &s;hips of war were left behind to protect the ve&s;&s;els which &s;hould arrive from England; in which they were not perfectly &s;ucce&s;&s;ful. The great extent of the bay, with its numerous creeks and i|&s;lands, and the number of &s;mall ports that &s;urrounded it, afforded &s;uch opportunities to the provincial arm|ed boats, and privateers that they took a number of tho&s;e which were &s;till in ignorance that the town had changed its ma&s;ters.</P>
<P>Upon the Briti&s;h forces leaving Bo&s;ton, it might have been expected, that they would have left a garri|&s;on in Ca&s;tle William to have kept the command of the harbour; but this was not thought a &s;afe mea&s;ure. By the motion of the coloni&s;ts, and particularly their taking their &s;tations on the neighbouring i&s;lands, it was conjectured that they intended to attack Ca&s;tle-William, the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of which would have been a means of &s;hutting up the &s;hips of war in the harbour. General Howe before he left the place blew up the fortifications to render it un&s;erviceable for the time. It argues that he was afraid of the expedition of the provincials, that they &s;hould even take the ca&s;tle be|fore he got the &s;hips out of the harbour; this does
<PB N="61" REF="62">not &s;ay that he put much tru&s;t either in the valour of his troops, or the naval force he had in Bo&s;ton har|bour. Of all the defeats that have been given to the coloni&s;ts &s;ince the beginning of this di&s;mal war, there does not appear to have been either as great &s;igns of hurry or flight in any of them, as happened to the Bri|ti&s;h forces in this change of their po&s;ition.</P>
<P>General Wa&s;hington was now in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the capital of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ett's Bay; but being ignorant of the de&s;tination of the fleet, and apprehen&s;ive of an attempt upon New York, he detached &s;everal regi|ments for the protection of that city, on the very day upon which he took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Bo&s;ton. The roy|al army were not as yet in a &s;ituation which admitted of their undertaking any expedition. They wanted both provi&s;ions and refre&s;hment before they undertook any expedition of con&s;equence. They did not, it was &s;aid, exceed nine thou&s;and effective men, and were in other re&s;pects very ill provided. This army, which was three times more numerous than was thought &s;ufficient to conquer all America, was now like the Trojans &s;ent to traver&s;e the &s;ea to &s;eek new habita|tions, with a number of the inhabitants of Bo&s;ton, who had carried all they could along with them, in hopes of better times. This was a mortifying blow to the &s;chemes of the mini&s;try, who had given out that the &s;ight of a few grenadiers would frighten the whole colonies into a compliance with their mea&s;ures. Their invincible troops were now obliged to abandon Bo&s;ton before a new rai&s;ed militia, who were cow|ards accounted at home, that neither would nor could fight.</P>
<P>The e&s;tates and effects of tho&s;e emigrants who ac|companied General Howe to Halifax were ordered
<PB N="62" REF="63">to be &s;old, and the produce applied to the public &s;er|vice. Some who ventured to &s;tay behind, though they knew them&s;elves obnoxious to the pre&s;ent go|vernment, were brought to trial as public enemies and betrayers of their country; and the e&s;tates of &s;uch as were found guilty were confi&s;cated in the &s;ame manner. But nothing occupied &s;o much the mind of the people of Bo&s;ton, or had &s;o much attention paid to it by the province in general, as the putting of that town in &s;uch a &s;tate of defence as might prevent a repe|tition of tho&s;e evils which it lately experienced. For this purpo&s;e the greate&s;t diligence was u&s;ed in forti|fying the town and harbour, &s;ome foreign engineers were procured to &s;uperintend the works, and every inhabitant devoted two days in the week to its con|&s;truction. Some have much doubted if Bo&s;ton can be rendered tenable again&s;t an army, though the works may pre&s;erve it from in&s;ult. It will not be ea|&s;y however for a fleet to approach it, provided Ca&s;|tle William is well fortified and well manned, to de|fend the harbour. No fleets or armies have attempt|ed to mole&s;t that town &s;ince General Howe's depar|ture.</P>
<P>We had left Colonel Arnold before Quebec; it will be nece&s;&s;ary to take a view of his proceedings before that city. While the&s;e things we have now related were carried on at Bo&s;ton, the blockade of Quebec was continued by Arnold under great hard|&s;hips and difficulties. Reinforcements arrived &s;low|ly, and the Canadians, who are exceedingly fickle and incon&s;tant, were di&s;heartened and wavering. Some have thought that the congre&s;s were unequal in con|duct as well as re&s;ources, to the management of &s;o ma|ny operations at the &s;ame time; and it is not to be
<PB N="63" REF="64">wondered at, if they &s;hould not be able to manage &s;o many things at once according to their wi&s;hes, when the government of Britain blundered &s;o egregiou&s;ly in one leading object. Whatever there was in this, it is certain that the &s;uccours that were &s;ent &s;uffered in|credible hard&s;hips in their march; which they endur|ed with that fortitude which had hitherto di&s;tingui&s;h|ed the provincials in this war. On the other hand, General Carleton with his u&s;ual vigilance, guarded again&s;t every effort of fraud, force, or &s;urpri&s;e; but as all &s;upplies were cut off from the country, the in|habitants and garri&s;on &s;uffered many di&s;tre&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>As the &s;ea&s;on approached in which &s;upplies from England were expected, the Americans grew more active in their operations. They again renewed the &s;iege, and erected batteries, and made &s;everal attempts by fire &s;hips and otherwi&s;e to burn the ve&s;&s;els in the harbour. They failed in the&s;e attempts, tho' &s;ome of them were executed with great boldne&s;s and in|trepidity. Their troops were at one time drawn up, and &s;caling ladders, with every other preparation in readine&s;s for &s;torming the town, during the confu&s;ion which they expected the fire would have produced.&mdash; Though they had not all the &s;ucce&s;s they wi&s;hed, they however burnt a great part of the &s;uburbs, and the remaining hou&s;es being pulled down to prevent the &s;preading of the flames, afforded a mo&s;t &s;ea&s;onable re|lief of fuel to the town, which had for &s;ome time been exceedingly di&s;tre&s;&s;ed for the want of that nece&s;|&s;ary. While matters were in this &s;ituation, upon the 25th of March, a party of Canadians which had been embodied by Mr Beaujeu with a de&s;ign of rai&s;|ing the &s;iege, were encountered and ea&s;ily di&s;per&s;ed by a detachment of the rebels. This gave &s;pirits to
<PB N="64" REF="65">the provincials, but the effect was temporary and could not la&s;t long. Having failed in all their attempts of burning the town by bombs and hot balls, their hopes of taking it by &s;torm failed, while the&s;e of tak|ing it by a regular &s;iege daily le&s;&s;ened. Their artil|lery were too &s;mall and light to do much execution again&s;t a walled town, well fortified, and though not at pre&s;ent well defended, yet it was &s;upplied with a garri&s;on equal to the number of the be&s;iegers. Al|though con&s;iderable reinforcements arrived in the re|mote parts of the province, the various impediments of bad roads, and want of nece&s;&s;aries &s;uitable to the &s;ervice, prevented them from joining the troops en|gaged in the &s;iege. In this &s;tate of de&s;pondency, the &s;mall pox, the &s;courge and terror of the we&s;tern world, broke out, and made great ravages among them. Nor was the immediate effect with re&s;pect to life and health the wor&s;t con&s;equences of this calami|ty: for that di&s;order being con&s;idered by the Ameri|cans as a plaugue, and regarded with all the horror incident to that name, the dreadful infection broke in upon every other con&s;ideration, and rendered it difficult, if not impracticable, to &s;u&s;tain di&s;cipline, or pre&s;erve order. In this &s;ituation they intended to rai&s;e the &s;iege before the arrival of &s;uccours from England to the garri&s;on, which were &s;oon expected. General Woo&s;ter had gone to Montreal to make pre|paration nece&s;&s;ary for facilitating that purpo&s;e, when the I&s;is man of war, and two frigates which had &s;ail|ed from England, had forced their way through the ice, and arrived at Quebec before it was practicable for the provincials to make a retreat. The unex|pected &s;ight of the &s;hips threw them into confu&s;ion, which was heightened by the immediate effect of
<PB N="65" REF="66">cutting off all communication with their forces on the different &s;ides of the river.</P>
<P>General Carleton was too well ver&s;ed in military affairs to lo&s;e an opportunity of &s;eizing the advanta|ges which the pre&s;ent &s;ituation afforded. A &s;mall de|tachment of land forces which arrived with the &s;hips of war, together with the marines, being landed with the utmo&s;t expedition, and joined to the garri&s;on up|on the 6th of May, the Governor marched immedi|ately to attack the provincial camp. He found eve|ry thing there in the greate&s;t confu&s;ion; they had not even covered them&s;elves with an intrenchment, and having already begun a retreat, upon the appear|ance of the King's troops they fled, abandoning their artillery, &s;caling ladders, and other matters of incum|brance. The flight was &s;o precipitate as &s;carcely to admit of any execution, nor were the King's troops in any condition for a pur&s;uit, if prudence could even have ju&s;tified the mea&s;ure.</P>
<P>Thus Quebec was freed from a mixed &s;iege and blockade, after it had been inve&s;ted about five months, and Canada pre&s;erved by the fortitude and con&s;tancy of General Carleton and the garri&s;on, which did them great honour. From this time the provincials expe|rienced a continued &s;eries of lo&s;&s;es and misfortunes in that province. The Governor &s;hewed him&s;elf wor|thy of his &s;ucce&s;s, by an act which immediately &s;uc|ceeded it, and which does credit to his humanity.&mdash; A number of &s;ick and wounded provincials lay &s;cat|tered about and hid in woods and villages, when they were in the greate&s;t danger of peri&s;hing under the complicated pre&s;&s;ure of want, fear, and di&s;ea&s;e. To prevent this melancholy con&s;equence, he i&s;&s;ued a pro|clamation, commanding the proper officers to find
<PB N="66" REF="67">out the&s;e unhappy per&s;ons, and to afford them all ne|ce&s;&s;ary relief and a&s;&s;i&s;tance at the public expence, whil&s;t to render the benefit compleat, and to prevent ob&s;tinacy and apprehen&s;ion from marring its effect, he a&s;&s;ured them that as &s;oon as they were recovered, they &s;hould have their liberty to return to their re|&s;pective provinces. This was truly generous as well as humane, and &s;peaks for General Carleton more than the greate&s;t victory could have done. Such a noble greatne&s;s of mind mu&s;t procure the e&s;teem of his greate&s;t enemies, and adorn his character in the view of all worthy men. It is only a great man that can perform &s;uch noble and di&s;intere&s;ted deeds, and &s;oar above the mean and pitiful pa&s;&s;ion of revenge and re&s;entment.</P>
<P>About the end of May, &s;everal regiments from Ire|land, one from England, and another from General Howe, together with the Brun&s;wick troops, arrived &s;ucce&s;&s;ively in Canada, &s;o that the whole forces in the province, when complicated, were e&s;timated at about 13,000 men. The general rendezvous was at the Three Rivers which lies half way between Quebec and Mount Real, and at the computed di&s;tance of a|bout ninety miles from each. This place lies on the north &s;ide of the river St. Lawrence, and takes its name from the neighbourhood of one of the branch|es of a large river, who&s;e waters are di&s;charged thro' three mouths into that great re&s;ervoir.</P>
<P>The provincials after their flight from Quebec con|tinued to retreat till they arrived on the banks of the river Sorrel, which falls into the river St. Lawrence, about 140 miles from Quebec, where they joined &s;ome of their reinforcements that had not been able to pro|ceed farther to their a&s;&s;i&s;tance; but they were now
<PB N="67" REF="68">&s;unk in their &s;pirits, and much enfeebled in their ac|tions; and to compleat their misfortunes, the &s;mall pox had &s;pread through all their quarters. The&s;e di&s;couraging circum&s;tances were not &s;ufficient to damp the &s;pirits of their enterpri&s;ing leaders. Notwith|&s;tanding all their pa&s;t fatigues and di&s;appointments, they formed a very daring plan with great addre&s;s, which had it &s;ucceeded according to its intention, would have been &s;everely felt by the King's forces. This plan was to &s;urpri&s;e the Briti&s;h troops at the three rivers; which if it had taken place, and been attended with all the &s;ucce&s;s it was capable of, might have been ranked among the mo&s;t con&s;iderable mili|tary exploits of that nature ever performed.</P>
<P>The Briti&s;h and Brun&s;wick forces were at this time much &s;eparated. A con&s;iderable body were &s;tationed at Three Rivers, under the command of Ge|neral Frazer. Another under that of Brigadier-Ge|neral Ni&s;bet, lay near them on board the tran&s;ports. The large&s;t body was along with the General Carle|ton, Burgoyne, Philips, and the German General, Reide&s;al, in &s;everal divi&s;ions, by land and water, on their way from Quebec. The di&s;tance from Sorrel was about fifty miles, and the &s;everal armed ve&s;&s;els and tran&s;ports full of troops, which had got up high|er than Three Rivers lay full in the way. In the face of all the&s;e dangers and difficulties, a body of about 2000 men, under the command of Major-General Thomp&s;on, embarked at Sorrel in fifty boats, and coa&s;ting the &s;outh &s;ide of the lake St. Peter, where the river St. Laurence &s;preads to a great extent, ar|rived at Newlet, from whence they fell down the ri|ver by night, and pa&s;&s;ed to the other &s;ide, with an in|tention of &s;urpri&s;ing the forces under the command
<PB N="68" REF="69">of General Frazer. The place called Three Rivers is rather to be con&s;idered as a long village than a re|gular town; and the de&s;ign was to attack before break of day, with a &s;trong detachment of the end, while two &s;maller parties were drawn up in readine&s;s to co|ver or &s;upport them.</P>
<P>The circum&s;tances concurring to give effect to this de&s;ign, were too numerous to afford any &s;trong con|fidence of &s;ucce&s;s. It was one of tho&s;e bold under|takings which might have produced great advantages; but it was of too perilous a nature for any thing le&s;s than the mo&s;t de&s;perate &s;ituation to ju&s;tify. The pro|vincials were neither &s;ufficiently numerous, nor pro|vided with artillery for &s;uch a daring and dangerous encounter; their troops were but lately rai&s;ed and unexperienced in the art of war, and they were now going to engage old troops under the command of great and experienced officers, furni&s;hed with every thing nece&s;&s;ary for either attacking or re&s;i&s;ting an e|nemy. Though the circum&s;tances of the parties had been equal, the i&s;&s;ue would &s;till have been doubtful, as &s;ome of the be&s;t forces in Britain, and perhaps in the world; were under the command of great officers, who&s;e honour as &s;oldiers and commanders of the be&s;t troops, was likely to prevent them from behaving un|worthy of the character they had long &s;u&s;tained.&mdash; There were many, if not every probable chance a|gain&s;t the coloni&s;ts: they were uncertain of arriving at the time propo&s;ed, as conveyance of troops by wa|ter was exceedingly uncertain as to time. The &s;mall|e&s;t &s;quall of wind on the lake might retard or inter|rupt their pa&s;&s;age, and in&s;tead of arriving at the time propo&s;ed, as actually happened, they might be a great while longer in reaching the de&s;ired point. The at|tempt
<PB N="69" REF="70">was therefore a mo&s;t de&s;perate enterpri&s;e, &s;carcely con&s;i&s;tent with any rules or maxims of com|mon prudence.</P>
<P>They mi&s;&s;ed their time by about an hour, and tho' they pa&s;&s;ed the armed &s;hips without ob&s;ervation, yet they were di&s;covered, and the alarm given at their landing. They afterwards got into bad grounds, and were involved in many difficulties, which threw them into di&s;order and confu&s;ion. In this condition they found General Frazer's corps ready to receive them, having landed &s;everal light &s;ix ponuders, which were played upon them with great execution. While they were thus engaged in the front, Brigadier Ne&s;bit, who&s;e tran&s;ports lay higher up the river, landed his forces full on their way back. Nothing was now left but a retreat, the performance of which was a thing more to be wi&s;hed for that rea&s;onably expected. Nes|bit's corps kept the &s;ide of the river to prevent their e&s;cape to their boats, while Fra&s;er pur&s;ued them, and galled them &s;everely with his light artillery. Between both they were driven for &s;ome miles through a deep &s;wamp which they pa&s;&s;ed with inconceivable toil, ex|po&s;ed to con&s;tant danger, and enduring every degree of di&s;tre&s;s. The Briti&s;h troops at length grew weary with the pur&s;uit, and the wood afforded them a wi&s;h|ed for &s;helter. The fir&s;t and &s;econd in command, with about two hundred others, were taken pri&s;on|ers, and it is &s;omewhat &s;trange that they were not all taken or de&s;troyed. The Briti&s;h forces were but lately arrived, and were not recovered from the fa|tigues of a long voyage, they were therefore as una|ble to pur&s;ue as the others were to &s;tand a &s;evere at|tack.</P>
<PB N="70" REF="71">
<P>This was the la&s;t vigorous pu&s;h which the provin|cials made for the conque&s;t of Canada. The Briti&s;h army having joined at Three Rivers, pu&s;hed forward by land and water with great expedition. They had now nothing but the ordinary chances of the way to interrupt their march, and they made all the expedi|tion that they could to arrive at the Sorrel. They arrived there upon the 15th of June, and found the enemy had abandoned the place &s;ome hours before, and di&s;mantled the batteries which they had erected to defend the entrance into the river, and had carried off their artillery and &s;tores. A &s;trong detachment was landed here, under the command of General Burgoyne, with orders to advance along the Sorrel to St. John's, while the remainder of the fleet and army &s;ailed up the river Longueil, the place of pa&s;&s;age from the i&s;land of Montreal to La Prairie on the continent. Here they di&s;covered that the enemy had abandoned the city and i&s;land of Montreal on the preceding evening, and that if the wind had been favourable, they might have met at this place. The army was immediately landed on the continent, and marching by La Prairie, cro&s;&s;ed by the penin&s;ula formed by the St. Lawrence and the Sorrel, in order to join Gene|ral Burgoyne at St. John's, where they expected a &s;tand and a &s;trong re&s;i&s;tance would have been made by the coloni&s;ts.</P>
<P>Burgoyne pur&s;ued his march along the Sorrel with|out intermi&s;&s;ion; but with much caution, as was ne|ce&s;&s;ary in a country where there was &s;till &s;u&s;picion of an enemy, and where their la&s;t and mo&s;t de&s;perate efforts were to be expected. In this the King's Ge|nerals were greatly mi&s;taken: for it appeared after|terwards not to have been any part of the plan of the

General Burgoyne arrived at St John's on the evening of the 18th of June, where he found the buildings on flames and nearly every thing de&s;troyed that could not be carried away.&mdash; The provincials acted in the &s;ame manner at Cham|blee, and burned &s;uch ve&s;&s;els as they were not able to drag up the rapids in their way to Lake Champlain, where they immediately embarked for Crown Point. Though their flight was precipitate, they &s;u&s;tained no lo&s;s, and General Sullivan who commanded the re|treat received public thanks for the prudence with which he conducted it, by which he &s;aved their ruin|ed army, at a time when it was encumbered with a va&s;t number of &s;ick, mo&s;t of whom were ill of the &s;mall pox.</P>
<P>An end was now put to the war in Canada; the ad|vantages of which were however con&s;iderably check|ed by the re&s;traint which was now laid upon the fur|ther operations of the army in that quarter. For as the coloni&s;ts were ma&s;ters of Lake Champlain, it was impo&s;&s;ible for the forces to proceed to the &s;outhward until &s;uch a number of ve&s;&s;els were con&s;tructed or ob|tained, as would afford a &s;uperiority, and enable them to cro&s;s that lake with &s;afety. The doing of this was a work of much labour and time: for though &s;ix arm|ed ve&s;&s;els were &s;ent from England for that purpo&s;e, the falls of Chamblee rendered the means of convey|ing highly difficult, and a matter which required much ingenuity and indu&s;try. A va&s;t number of other ve&s;|&s;els were al&s;o nece&s;&s;arily to be con&s;tructed, both for conveyance and protection. But we mu&s;t for awhile leave General Burgoyne and his army, and proceed to the operations on &s;ome other part of the continent.</P>

<P>North Carolina was this year in a &s;tate of great commotion. The Governor and the a&s;&s;embly were at open war, and each party u&s;ed their utmo&s;t endeavor to de&s;troy the other. Governor Martin we have al|ready ob&s;erved, was obliged to &s;eek refuge on board a &s;hip of war in Cape Fear river. This di&s;a&s;ter did not damp his ardour in the &s;ervice of government, nor re&s;train his attempts to reduce the province of North Carolina to obedience. He had received intelligence, that a &s;quadron of men of war with &s;even regiments under the conduct of Sir Peter Parker and Lord Corn|wallis, were to depart from Ireland on an expedition to the &s;outhern colonies in the beginning of the year, and that North Carolina was their fir&s;t if not their principal object. This encrea&s;ed his confidence, and rou&s;ed him to attempt &s;omething in the mean time. He al&s;o was informed that General Carleton with a &s;mall detachment, was on his way from New England to meet him at Cape Fear. He had formed a con|nection with a body of de&s;perate renegades, who had lately been con&s;idered as rebels and, enemies to the provincial e&s;tabli&s;hment, who went by the name of Regulators, and have been taken notice of in this hi&s;|tory. Having a&s;&s;embled a number of the&s;e and &s;ome Highland emigrants, he thought to accompli&s;h the re|duction of the in&s;urgents, even independent of the expected force. That colony was deemed the weak|e&s;t in America, except Georgia; and the two parties we have mentioned were numerous, active and daring, and the former as well as the latter were zealou&s;ly at|tached to the cau&s;e of government. The Highland|ers were con&s;idered as naturally warlike, and the Re|gulators, from their &s;ituation and manner of living, to be much bolder, hardier, and better mark&s;men, than
<PB N="73" REF="74">tho&s;e who had been bred to other cour&s;es, and in more civilized parts of the country. The Governor &s;ent &s;everal commi&s;&s;ions to the&s;e people, for the rai&s;|ing and commanding of regiments, and granted ano|ther to one Mr M'Donald to act as their General.&mdash; Along with the commi&s;&s;ion he &s;ent al&s;o a proclamation commanding all per&s;ons upon their allegiance to re|pair to the royal &s;tandard, which was erected by Ge|neral M'Donald about the middle of February. Go|vernor Martin had not well con&s;idered the character of either the General or troops he was now employing, though they were de&s;perate and wicked to an ex|treme, and capable of the mo&s;t daring actions when there was no immediate danger, yet being unprinci|pled, and having fixed the object before them, and being under no di&s;cipline, they were by no means to be tru&s;ted&mdash;All cau&s;es were alike to them, unle&s;s their own intere&s;t, which did not appear to be more con|nected with the cau&s;e of government than with that of the coloni&s;ts. Their after conduct declared that they were not much to be depended upon. They were in general a &s;ort of free booters, who delight|ed more in the plunder that attended commotions than in the defence of any cau&s;e what&s;oever. Their man|ner of war was again&s;t tho&s;e who had no arms of defence, but when they met with force they were rea|dy to fly, unle&s;s when they were &s;urrounded and could not get away. Such were the men, by means of who&s;e a&s;&s;i&s;tance Governor Martin thought to re|duce the province of Carolina to obedience.</P>
<P>This new General and his new rai&s;ed army were not long till they were brought to a trial of their prow|e&s;s; for upon the provincials receiving advice of their
<PB N="74" REF="75">a&s;&s;embling at a place called Cro&s;s Creek, Brigadier-General Moore was immediately ordered to march a|gain&s;t them at the head of a provincial regiment which he commanded, with &s;uch militia as he could collect, and &s;ome pieces of cannon. He marched within a few miles of them, and took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of an important po&s;t called Rockfort Bridge, which, as he was much inferior to them in &s;trength, he immediately entrench|ed and rendered defen&s;ible. He had not been ma|ny days in this &s;tation, where he was receiving and waiting for &s;uccours, than General M'Donald ap|proached at the head of his army, and &s;ent a letter to Moore, inclo&s;ing the Governor's proclamation, and recommending to him and his party to join the King's &s;tandard, by a given hour next day, or he mu&s;t be un|der the nece&s;&s;ity of con&s;idering them as enemies.</P>
<P>As Moore knew that the provincial forces were marching from all quarters, he protracted the negoci|ation, in hopes that the tory army, as they were cal|led, might have been &s;urrounded. In his final an|&s;wer he declared, that he and his officers con&s;idered them&s;elves as engaged in a cau&s;e the mo&s;t glorious and honourable in the world&mdash;the defence of the li|berties of mankind; he reminded the emigrants of the ungrateful return they had made to the kind re|ception they had met in the colony; and the Gene|ral, with &s;ome of his officers, of an oath they had ta|ken a little before, and upon which they were permit|ted to come into the country, that they only came to &s;ee their relations, without any concern whatever in public affairs. In return to the proclamation he &s;ent them the te&s;t propo&s;ed by the congre&s;s, with a proffer, that if they &s;ub&s;cribed it and laid down their arms, they &s;hould be received as friends; but if they refu&s;|ed
<PB N="75" REF="76">to comply, they might expect con&s;equences &s;imilar to tho&s;e which they had held out to his people. In the mean time Mr M'Donald perceived the danger he was in of being inclo&s;ed, and abruptly quitting his ground, endeavoured with con&s;iderable dexterity, by forced marches, the unexpected pa&s;&s;ing of rivers, and the greate&s;t quickne&s;s of movement, to di&s;engage him|&s;elf. It is thought to have been the &s;cheme of this party to bring Governor Martin, with Lord William Campbel, aad General Clinton, who had by this time joined them into the interior part of the country, which they judged would be a means of uniting all the back &s;ettlers of the &s;outhern colonies in the roy|al cau&s;e, of bringing forward the Indians, and of en|couraging the well-affected, to &s;hew them&s;elves in all places.</P>
<P>The provincials were however &s;o clo&s;e in the pur|&s;uit, and &s;o alert in cutting the country and &s;eizing the pa&s;&s;es, that M'Donald at length found him&s;elf under the nece&s;&s;ity of engaging one Colonel Ca&s;well, who with about 1000 militia and minutemen had tak|en po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a place called Moore Creek Bridge, where they had thrown up an intrenchment. The royali&s;ts were by all accounts much &s;uperior in num|ber, being about 3000 &s;trong; even M'Donald him|&s;elf after the battle confe&s;&s;ed that they were 1500.&mdash; The emigrants began the attack with great fury; but M'Leod; the &s;econd in command, and a few more of their brave&s;t officers being killed, at the fir&s;t attack, the &s;uddenly lo&s;t all &s;pirit, fled with the greate&s;t pre|cipitation, and, as the coloni&s;ts affirm, de&s;erted their General, who was taken pri&s;oner, as were nearly all their leaders, and the re&s;t totally broken and di&s;per&s;|ed. It is often the fate of the Highlanders, when
<PB N="76" REF="77">they meet with a &s;teady re&s;i&s;tance, and lo&s;e any of their chiefs, to make a precipitate flight. Their fu|ry is violent, but it is &s;oon over; and if the troops whom they engage can &s;tand their fir&s;t attack, they will be very ready to conquer them, or at lea&s;t to put them to flight.</P>
<P>This victory greatly elated the Carolinians. They had &s;hewn that their province was not &s;o weak as was imagined; for though their force in the engage|ment was not con&s;iderable, they had rai&s;ed 10,000 men in the &s;pace of ten days. But what was &s;till more flattering, they had encountered Europeans, who had held them in the mo&s;t &s;overeign contempt, both as men and &s;oldiers in the field, and had defeated them with an inferior force.</P>
<P>Had the zeal of this people been kept dormant till the forces had arrived from England, it is highly pro|bable that the &s;outhern colonies would have con&s;i|derably felt the impre&s;&s;ion of the in&s;urrection of the Regulators and emigrants. But now their force and &s;pirits were &s;o entirely broken, their leaders being &s;ent to different pri&s;ons, and the re&s;t &s;tripped of their arms, and watched with all the eyes of di&s;tru&s;t and &s;u&s;picion, that no future effort could rea&s;onably be expected from them. Governor Martin appears to have had more zeal than di&s;cretion for the cau&s;e of government, and &s;eems to have been totally ignorant of the temper and di&s;po&s;ition of the colony he govern|ed;&mdash;for as he was informed of the de&s;tination of troops from Ireland to the &s;outhern provinces, he ought to have waited till their arrival, when his emi|grants and Regulators could have done &s;ome &s;ervice. But the method which he took was an effectual one to arm the province, and have them in readine&s;s when
<PB N="77" REF="78">the King's troops arrived, to give them a warm re|ception. By all that one can learn from the hi&s;tory of this war, it &s;eems to have been rai&s;ed by the igno|rance and pride of the &s;everal Governors of the pro|vinces, who mi&s;informed government with regard to the &s;tate of the colonies. There does not &s;eem to have been one of them on the &s;ide of government, that neither know the number of their friends nor the power of their enemies. Martin and his friends were totally mi&s;taken in rating the prowe&s;s of the in|&s;urgents, and de&s;pi&s;ing the power of the coloni&s;ts.&mdash; And it is a mi&s;take that has prevailed at home &s;ince the beginning of this de&s;tructive war, that the valour and power of our troops could not be re&s;i&s;ted, and that the coloni&s;ts were mean &s;pirited, cowardly, and in&s;ignificant. It mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed that it is extremely difficult to regulate or re&s;train the caprice or violence of tho&s;e leaders, who a&s;&s;ume authority on &s;uch occa&s;ions. They have not always been the wi&s;e&s;t in the Kingdom of Great Britain that have been &s;ent to be Governors of our colonies: they are generally the friends of the mini&s;ter, or &s;ome of their friends, and that is accounted a &s;ufficient qualification.</P>
<P>The congre&s;s were not inattentive to their own in|tere&s;ts in the mid&s;t of the&s;e tumults in the different colonies, and they turned their view to objects of im|portance in all parts of the colonies. The blunders of our mini&s;try and their late Governors taught them wi&s;dom. They joined execution with de&s;ign, and en|deavoured to execute their plans as &s;peedily as pru|dence required. Upon the third of March they fit|ted out a &s;quadron of five frigates, under the command of Commodore Hopkins, who &s;ailed to the Bahama i&s;lands, when they &s;tripped the i&s;land of Providence,
<PB N="78" REF="79">which is the principle one, of a con&s;iderable quanti|ty of artillery and &s;tores. They were however di&s;ap|pointed in the powder, which they mo&s;t wanted, through the prudence of the Governor, who &s;ent an hundred and fifty barrels of it away in a &s;mall ve&s;&s;el the night before they landed. They brought off the Governor, and &s;ome other public per&s;ons, as pri&s;on|ers; and after taking &s;everal prizes in their return, fell on at la&s;t with the Gla&s;gow frigate of war, accom|panied with a tender, the latter of which they took, and the former e&s;caped with difficulty, after a &s;harp engagement.</P>
<P>All this time, Lord Dunmore, with his fleet of fu|gitives, continued on the coa&s;ts, and in the rivers of Virginia, and remained in a hovering &s;ituation for a great part of the year; but as every place was now &s;trictly guarded, the&s;e unhappy people who had put them&s;elves under his protection, &s;uffered very great di&s;tre&s;&s;es. The heat of the weather, and the badne&s;s and &s;carcity of water and provi&s;ions, with the clo&s;e|ne&s;s and na&s;tine&s;s of the &s;mall ve&s;&s;els in which they were crouded, by degrees produced that infectious and malignant di&s;temper which is known by the name of pe&s;tilential fever. This dreadful di&s;order made great havoc among them, but particularly affected the negroes, mo&s;t of whom it &s;wept away. After various adventures, in which they were driven from place to place, and from i&s;land to i&s;land, by the Virgi|ans, &s;everal of the ve&s;&s;els were driven on &s;hore in a gale of wind, and the wretched fugitives became cap|tives to their own countrymen. At la&s;t, every place being &s;hut up again&s;t them, and ho&s;tile to the remain|der, and neither water nor provi&s;ions to be obtained, even at the expence of blood, it was found nece&s;&s;ary
<PB N="79" REF="80">towards the beginning of Augu&s;t to burn the &s;malle&s;t and lea&s;t valuable ve&s;&s;els, and to &s;end the remainder, amounting to 40 or 50 fail, with the exiles, to &s;eek &s;helter and retreat in Florida, Bermudas, and the We&s;t Indies. In this manner ended the hopes enter|tained by the employment of the negroes, to &s;uppre&s;s the rebellion in the &s;outhern colonies. This mea&s;ure, rather invidious than powerful, tended much to in|flame the di&s;contents in the&s;e colonies, without ad|ding any &s;trength to the King's arms. The unhappy creatures that engaged in it are &s;aid to have peri&s;hed almo&s;t to a man. This conduct of Lord Dunmore's in employing the negroes, and in burning Norfolk was extolled by the tories at home as the mo&s;t righte|ous and heroic proceeding, and all the venal new&s;pa|pers in the nation echoed his Lord&s;hip's prai&s;es, and commended his tran&s;actions. His lo&s;&s;es and defeats were denied or concealed by government as long as po&s;&s;ible, till Dunmore's di&s;grace drove the mini&s;try to &s;till more de&s;perate experiments, and every new pro|ject to fulfil their de&s;igns, expo&s;ed more and more their folly and malignity. Every new &s;tep in their pro|ceedings demon&s;trated the darkne&s;s of their under|&s;tanding, and a real want of &s;y&s;tem and method in all they attempted to perform.</P>
<P>Providence for a &s;ea&s;on &s;eemed al&s;o to frown upon their &s;chemes and mea&s;ures, and what was either pur|&s;ued without wi&s;dom, or carried on through pride and ambition, was fru&s;trated by an immediate hand of providence. The fleets, tran&s;ports, and victuallers, which had been &s;ent to America, met with exceeding|ly bad weather in their pa&s;&s;age, and &s;o many delays and untoward circum&s;tances of different &s;orts befel them, that in a great degree fru&s;trated the end of
<PB N="80" REF="81">their de&s;tination. Sir Peter Parker's &s;quadron which &s;ailed from Port&s;mouth in the end of the year, met with unexpected delays in Ireland, and bad weather afterwards, &s;o that they did not arrive at Cape Fear till the beginning of May, where they were detained by various cau&s;es till the end of the month. They met there with General Clinton, who had already been from New York, and from thence proceeded to Virginia, where he had &s;een Lord Dunmore, and finding that no &s;ervice could be effected at either place, with his &s;mall force came to this place to wait for them. This &s;ea&s;on of the year was very unfortu|nate for the troops, and much again&s;t any operations which they intended to perform. The exce&s;&s;ive heat rendered the troops &s;ickly, even at Cape Fear, notwith&s;tanding the plenty of refre&s;hments they pro|cured, and the little labour they had upon their hands. They found it nece&s;&s;ary to do &s;omething, and Charle&s;town, the capital of South Carolina, be|ing within the line of Sir Peter Parker and Lord Cornwallis's in&s;tructions, they determined to make an impre&s;&s;ion in that quarter. They had little informa|tion of General Howe's &s;ituation, nor did General Clinton know of his evacuating Bo&s;ton but through the channel of an American new&s;paper. And it happen|ed &s;o unfortunately, that a ve&s;&s;el which General Howe had di&s;patched from Halifax with orders for their proceeding to the northward met with &s;uch delays in her pa&s;&s;age that &s;he did not arrive at Cape Fear till af|ter their departure.</P>
<P>The fleet anchored off Charle&s;town bar in the be|ginning of June. They were joined before they proceeded to action by the Experiment man of war: and the naval force then con&s;i&s;ted of the Commodore
<PB N="81" REF="82">Sir Peter Parker's &s;hip of 50 guns; the Experiment, of the &s;ame force; the Active, Solebay, Acteon, and Syren, of 28 guns each; the Sphynx, of 20, an hired armed &s;hip of 22, a &s;mall &s;loop of war, an arm|ed &s;chooner, and the Thunderer bomb-ketch. The pa&s;&s;age of the bar was a work of time, difficulty, and danger, e&s;pecially to the two large &s;hips, which tho' they had taken out their guns, and u&s;ed every other means to lighten them as much as po&s;&s;ible, both touch|ed the ground, and &s;truck &s;everal times. The land forces were commanded by General Clinton, Lord Cornwallis, and Brigadier-General Vaughan. It is &s;omewhat &s;urpri&s;ing, that at the time General Clin|ton &s;ailed from Bo&s;ton, General Lee at the head of a &s;trong detachment from the army before that place immediately &s;et out to &s;ecure New York, from the &s;uppo&s;ed attempt, the former would have made upon that city. Having &s;ucceeded in that object, General Clinton could not but be &s;urpri&s;ed at his arrival in Virginia, to find Lee in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and in the &s;ame &s;tate of preparation in which he had left him at New-York. Upon Clinton's departure from Cape Fear, Lee traver&s;ed the continent with the utmo&s;t expedi|tion, to &s;ecure North Carolina. And at length up|on the further progre&s;s of the fleet and army to the &s;outhward, General Lee again with equal celerity proceeded to the defence of Charle&s;town. It was &s;carcely credible that &s;o much expedition could have been made by any man in &s;uch a warm climate at that &s;ea&s;on of the year, and perhaps no man ever po&s;ted &s;o &s;wiftly amid&s;t &s;o great difficulties and di&s;advantages.&mdash; The animating &s;pirit of liberty gives wings to inven|tion, and vigour to the animal &s;pirits, which &s;laves and dupes to power know nothing of. It could not
<PB N="82" REF="83">have been in the power of tho&s;e who&s;e mind was not invigorated by &s;ome animating principles, to have gone through the fatigues, wearine&s;&s;es, and watchings of &s;uch a tedious journey.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t object of our forces after pa&s;&s;ing the bar was the back of a fort which had been lately erected, though not yet quite furni&s;hed nor rendered altoge|ther complete, upon the &s;outh we&s;t point of Sullivan I&s;land. This fort commanded the pa&s;&s;age to Charle&s;|town, which lay farther we&s;t by &s;ix miles di&s;tance;&mdash; and though it had been but lately con&s;tructed, was properly con&s;idered the key of that harbour. It was &s;aid that it was repre&s;ented to our officers as in a more imperfect &s;tate than it was found; but &s;uppo&s;ing it had been more perfect than it was, he could not ima|gine that a raw militia could have been able to have defended it for any length of time again&s;t the great weight of metal and the force of fire from our &s;hips, even excluding the co-operation of the land forces. So impartial were our people in their judgment con|cerning their own prowe&s;s, and the force and valour of their enemies. The colonies had con&s;idered the danger before they engaged in it, and knew the opi|nion which the Briti&s;h forces had of their courage; they were determined for once to put the Briti&s;h in|trepidity to trial, and &s;hew them a &s;pecimen what a militia animated by the &s;pirit of liberty could do.</P>
<P>Our troops were landed on Long I&s;land, which lies nearer, and to the ea&s;tward of Sullivan's, being &s;eparated only by &s;ome &s;hoals, and a creek called the Breech, which are deemed pa&s;&s;able at low water, the ford being repre&s;ented to our people as only 18 inches in depth in that &s;tate. The Carolinians had po&s;ted &s;ome forces within a few pieces of cannon near
<PB N="83" REF="84">the north ea&s;t extremity of Sullivan's I&s;land, at the di&s;tance of two miles from the fort, where they had thrown up works to prevent the pa&s;&s;age of the royal army over the breach. General Lee was encamped with a con&s;iderable body of forces upon the continent at the back and to the northward of the i&s;land, with which he had a communication open by a bridge of boats, and could by that means at any time march the whole or any part of his forces to &s;upport that po&s;t which was oppo&s;ed to our men's pa&s;&s;age from Long-I&s;land. The latter is a naked burning &s;and, where the troops &s;uffered greatly from their expo&s;ure to the inten&s;e heat of the &s;un. Both the fleet were greatly di&s;tre&s;&s;ed through the badne&s;s of the water: that which is found upon the &s;ea coa&s;t of Carolina be|ing every where bracki&s;h. Nor were they in a better condition with re&s;pect to the quantity or qua|lity of their provi&s;ions. Tho' the greate&s;t di&s;patch was nece&s;&s;ary on account of the&s;e inconveniences, yet &s;uch delays occurred in carrying the de&s;ign into exe|cution, that it was near the end of the month before the attack on Sullivan's I&s;land took place; a &s;ea&s;on which was applied by the provincials with great dili|gence for compleating their works. Every thing being at length &s;ettled between the commamders by &s;ea and land, the Thunderer Bomb, covered by the armed &s;hip, took her &s;tation in the morning, and began the attack by throwing &s;hells at the fort as the fleet advanced. About eleven o'clock, the Bri&s;tol, Experiment, Active, and Solebay, brought up di|rectly again&s;t the fort, and began a mo&s;t furious and ince&s;&s;ant canonade.&mdash;The Sphynx, Acteon, and Syren, were ordered to the we&s;tward, to take their &s;tation between the end of the i&s;land and Charles
<PB N="84" REF="85">town, with a de&s;ign to explode the works of the fort, and, if po&s;&s;ible, to cut off the communication between the i&s;land and continent, which would of cour&s;e cut off the retreat of the garri&s;on, as well as all &s;uccours for its a&s;&s;i&s;tance. There was al&s;o another intention in this po&s;ition of the &s;hips, namely, to prevent any attempt of &s;ending the &s;hips to interrupt the attack.&mdash; This part of the de&s;ign was rendered unfortunate by the &s;trange un&s;kilfulne&s;s of the pilot, who entangled the frigates in the &s;hoals called the Middle Grounds, where they all &s;tuck fa&s;t; and though two of them were in &s;ome time got off with danger and difficulty, it was then too late, and they were at no condition to execute the intended &s;ervice. The Acteon could not be got off, and was burnt by the officers and crew the next morning, to prevent her materials and &s;tores from becoming a prey to the enemy.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t a continued cannonade from the &s;hips &s;eemed &s;ufficient to &s;hake the firmne&s;s of the brave&s;t foe, and daunt the courage of the brave&s;t &s;oldiers, the return made from the fort was equally terrible, and could not fail of calling for re&s;pect as well as of &s;triking terror into every Briti&s;h &s;eaman.</P>
<P>In the mid&s;t of that dreadful roar of artillery, they &s;tood to their guns with the greate&s;t firmne&s;s and con&s;tancy, and fired with &s;uch deliberation and cool|ne&s;s, that they &s;eldom mi&s;&s;ed their aim. The &s;hips &s;uf|fered prodigiou&s;ly; they were almo&s;t torn to pieces, and the &s;laughter was dreadful. Scarcely was ever Bri|ti&s;h valour put to &s;o &s;evere a trial, nor ever did our ar|my in any engagement of the &s;ame nature meet with &s;o rude an encounter. They began now to find that Sullivan fort was not &s;o ea&s;ily taken as they appre|hended, and that the cowards in Carolina had chang|ed
<PB N="85" REF="86">their character. The &s;prings of the Bri&s;tol's ca|ble were cut off by the &s;hot, and &s;he lay for &s;ome time expo&s;ed as a mark to the fire of the fort, and was mo&s;t terribly raked. Captain Morris, who had &s;hewn much bravery was covered with wounds, though he &s;till kept his &s;tation, and refu&s;ed to retire, until his arm being &s;hot off, he was carried away in a condi|tion that did not afford a po&s;&s;ibility of his recovery.&mdash; The quarter deck of the Bri&s;tol was once cleared of every per&s;on except the Commodore, who &s;tood a|lone a &s;pectacle of firmne&s;s and intrepidity, which has been never excelled, and &s;eldom equalled. The o|thers on that deck were either carried down to have their wounds dre&s;&s;ed, or were killed in the conflict. Captain Scott, of the Experiment, had his own &s;hare of his danger or glory, who, be&s;ides the lo&s;s of an arm, received &s;o many other wounds, that his life was at fir&s;t de&s;paired of. Our fleet thought once that they had &s;ilenced the fort, and concluded that the day was their own, and that the forces on &s;hore might have taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion thereof, but in this they were mi&s;tak|en; for this &s;ilence proceeded from the want of am|munition which the provincials had to carry from the continent. It &s;eems indeed extraordinary that a de|tachment of land forces was not ready to take the advantage of the &s;ilence of the fort, and improve this opportunity. The rea&s;ons of this have never been &s;ufficiently cleared up by any well-authenticated ac|counts: &s;ome have blamed the commander in chief for not co operating with the fleet, whil&s;t others have attempted to &s;hew that it was impo&s;&s;ible for the land forces to afford them any a&s;&s;i&s;tance. To &s;et forth the bravery of our &s;eamen, it was &s;trongly a&s;&s;erted at home, that they drove the Americans from the fort;
<PB N="86" REF="87">but this does not at all appear to have have been the ca&s;e. For the garri&s;on received the thanks and prai&s;e of the Americans, as well as of General Lee, which is a proof that they did not believe that they abandoned the fort, de&s;erted the guns, or were chang|ed, though they might be, and certainly were, rein|forced.</P>
<P>During this &s;evere and hot conte&s;t, the &s;eamen looked often and impatiently towards the ea&s;t to &s;ee the land forces advance from Long I&s;land, to draw the rebels from the fort and entrenchments. In the&s;e hopes they were grievou&s;ly di&s;appointed. What was the rea&s;on of this inaction of the land forces has never been fully explained. The papers publi&s;hed by au|thority are &s;o totally defective and un&s;atisfactory up|on this point, that it is impo&s;&s;ible to learn any thing from them to clear up this matter. The Gazette upon this occa&s;ion is the mo&s;t jarring and incon&s;i&s;tent account that ever was given of any tran&s;action of &s;uch a nature, and it is impo&s;&s;ible to form any other conclu&s;ion from that paper, than that it was compo&s;|ed to throw mi&s;t and darkne&s;s upon the &s;ubject.&mdash; From the day that the action at Bunker's hill happen|ed till this pre&s;ent time, the method of literary compo|&s;ition, as well as the art of war&punc; &s;eems to have for&s;ak|en the Briti&s;h mini&s;try and officers; for in their ac|count of the various tran&s;actions of this unhallowed war, there appears to be nothing but confu&s;ion, in|con&s;i&s;tency, and want of method</P>
<P>The Gazette &s;ays, that the King's troops were &s;topped by an impracticable depth of water, where they expected to have pa&s;&s;ed almo&s;t dry&s;hod. This is &s;uch an imputation upon the character of the offi|cers, and particularly the commander in chief, as &s;ets
<PB N="87" REF="88">them forth in the mo&s;t de&s;picable light. To &s;uppo&s;e that General Clinton and his officers &s;hould have been nineteen days in that &s;mall i&s;land, without ever examining until the very time of action the nature of the only pa&s;&s;age by which they could render any &s;er|vice to their friends, and an&s;wer the purpo&s;e of their landing and the end of the expedition, appears an in|tolerable want of military prudence and cricum&s;pec|tion. In the way the Gazette tells this &s;tory, Gene|ral Clinton de&s;erved to have been &s;everely cen&s;ured and puni&s;hed for his negligence and inattention; for provided he had intended to have driven a flock of &s;heep over the continent, it would have been nece&s;&s;a|ry to have &s;ounded the depth of the water before hand to have found whether it was po&s;&s;ible to pa&s;s them over without drowning of them. There might perhaps be rea&s;on for concealing the true &s;tate of this affair, and probably no blame to be imputed to the commander and officers. General Clinton certainly acted wi&s;ely in not attempting to pa&s;s over to the con|tinent, for there was &s;uch a force under General I$ee, and &s;o well po&s;ted, that had our men advanced, as was expected, it would have been impo&s;&s;ible to have &s;aved them from a total overthrow. The com|mander in chief in that expectation was never believ|ed to have written the&s;e accounts that were written in his name concerning his mi&s;take about the depth of the water: this was always con&s;idered as a mini&s;teri|al apology framed by tho&s;e who manufactured the Gazette, who for want of common &s;en&s;e put in that ab&s;urdity into the paper. They were not willing to allow that the coloni&s;ts had either force or courage to oppo&s;e our men, and therefore they created &s;even feet of water to pre&s;erve their power and courage,
<PB N="88" REF="89">and to &s;upport their own idea of the American pu&s;il|animity. It was not the depth of the water that pre|vented General Clinton from attacking Sullivan Fort, but his own prudence and &s;agacity, who when he perceived upon a nearer in&s;pection the force of the enemy, and that to attack them would be attended with certain de&s;truction to his own army, he wi&s;ely de&s;i&s;ted from an experiment that could do no good, but would have been attended with much evil, both to him&s;elf and the cau&s;e he was engaged in. It has been the happine&s;s of the&s;e brave officers who have &s;erved the pre&s;ent government in this ruinous war, ne|ver to have their actions fairly &s;tated in the public ac|counts of their proceedings. They have at one time been extolled beyond all the limits of di&s;cretion, as heroes of extraordinory magnitude, and by the very &s;ame authority le&s;&s;ened and depreciated to the lowe&s;t degree of character.</P>
<P>By comparing all accounts concerning the attack upon Sullivan I&s;land, it appears that our people had been mi&s;taken in e&s;timating the force and &s;trength of the coloni&s;ts, and that they &s;ound that they had much more to do than &s;ubdue Sullivan &s;ort. An army rea|dy appointed and well po&s;ted was prepared to receive them, which if they had proceeded to attack, they mu&s;t have fallen a &s;acrifice to their own folly and ra&s;h|ne&s;s.</P>
<P>This action continued till the darkne&s;s of the night compelled the a&s;&s;ailants to de&s;i&s;t; they however &s;hew|ed much eagerne&s;s, notwit&s;tanding their wearine&s;s, lo&s;s, and fatigue to give up the enterpri&s;e. Sir Peter Parker after u&s;ing every effort which bravery is capa|ble of, finding that all hope of &s;ucce&s;s was at an end, and the ebbing tide near &s;pent, withdrew his &s;hat|tered
<PB N="89" REF="90">ve&s;&s;els between nine and ten o'clock of the evening, after an engagement which had been &s;up|ported for above ten hours with uncommon courage and bravery. The Bri&s;tol had 111, and the Experi|ment 79 men killed and wounded, and both &s;hips had received &s;o much damage, that the provincials con|ceived hopes that they could not have been got over the bar. The frigates did not &s;uffer &s;o &s;everely, for the provincials pointed their fire principally at the great &s;hips. The Bomb ve&s;&s;el did little &s;ervice upon this occa&s;ion; there appeared to be a real want of art in the management of the mortars, for &s;ome were overcharged, and the beds &s;o &s;hattered and loo&s;ed that they were rendered u&s;ele&s;s.</P>
<P>It was not expected that their &s;mall in&s;ignificant fort would have been able to have with&s;tood the heavy fire of our &s;hips the &s;pace of one hour, though upon trial it was found that after ten hours &s;evere cannon|ade, it was as far from being reduced as at the be|ginning. The provincials &s;hewed on this occa&s;ion both &s;kill and intrepedity, which would have done honour to veteran troops; both officers and men per|formed their duty to the amazement of their enemies, and conducted their fire with &s;uch deliberation and de&s;ign, that almo&s;t every &s;hot did execution. The carnage a-board the Bri&s;tol and Experiment was dreadful, and the &s;hips were hulled in a terrible man|ner. The guns of the fort are &s;aid to have been 42. pounders, and were formerly tho&s;e that belonged to the Foudroyant man of war, which had been formerly taken from the French: the&s;e did dreadful execution: The Briti&s;h &s;ailors did all that brave men could do, but as the land forces could not po&s;&s;ibly a&s;&s;i&s;t them,
<PB N="90" REF="91">they were obliged with great reluctance to give up this dangerous and fatal attempt.</P>
<P>Colonel Moultrie, who commanded in the fort, re|ceived great and de&s;erved prai&s;e from his country|men, for the courage and conduct by which he was &s;o much di&s;tingui&s;hed in its defence. The garri&s;on al&s;o received great applau&s;e, and a &s;erjeant was pub|licly honoured with a pre&s;ent of a &s;word, from the pre&s;ident of the congre&s;s, for a particular act of bra|very. This defence greatly rai&s;ed the character of the Carolinians and the &s;outhern colonies, and taught our mini&s;try that the coloni&s;ts in all quarters were in earne&s;t. They had fal&s;ely affirmed, that the colonies in the &s;outh were not &s;o hardy and brave as the New England ones and tho&s;e in the north, and that the cli|mate, or &s;omething peculiar to tho&s;e colonies, made them all naturally cowards. This was now fully re|futed by an experiment which the mini&s;try could not help feeling in the mo&s;t tender manner, though their pen&s;ioned &s;cribblers continue to harp &s;till upon the &s;ame &s;tring, and repeat the &s;ame notes. Men who are them&s;elves &s;laves either to their lu&s;ts, or to the will and plea&s;ure of other men, have no ideas concern|ing tho&s;e exertions, both of mind and body, with which the &s;pirit of liberty in&s;pires tho&s;e that are po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed with it. It is with &s;uch as it is with di&s;hone&s;t men who them&s;elves pay no regard to truth, they be|lieve that there is no &s;uch thing as hone&s;ty in the world.</P>
<P>The apologies at home for this mi&s;carriage were as incon&s;i&s;tent as the attempt it&s;elf. The blame was laid upon the heat of the weather and the depth of the water, which was not fore&s;een till the moment of ac|tion, and by this kind of apology, when they were
<PB N="91" REF="92">commending the wi&s;dom of the officers and the brave|ry of the Briti&s;h troops, they were expo&s;ing them to the world as de&s;titute of common &s;en&s;e and di&s;cretion. The heat of the weather might have ea&s;ily been fore|&s;een, and the depth of the water &s;ounded in the &s;pace of nineteen days. But the advocates for the &s;chemes of the mini&s;try were willing rather to publi&s;h the gro&s;|&s;e&s;t ab&s;urdities, than to admit that their &s;chemes were erroneous, or that the coloni&s;ts had any courage.</P>
<P>Before we proceed to the progre&s;s of the grand army under General Howe, it mu&s;t be ob&s;erved, that during the&s;e tran&s;actions in Carolina, the continental congre&s;s took an opportunity to &s;ound the minds of the people concerning a declaration of independency, and by every po&s;&s;ible means to prepare them for it.&mdash; Upon the 15th of May they &s;ent a &s;ort of circular mainife&s;to to the &s;everal colonies, &s;tating the cau&s;es which rendered it, as they &s;aid, nece&s;&s;ary, that all au|thority of the crown &s;hould be totally &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, and all the powers of government taken into their own hands. As this was an adventerous proceeding, and new in the hi&s;tory of &s;ociety, we will be obliged to take a view of the arguments offered by the coloni&s;ts in defence of their practice, as well as of tho&s;e offered by government for their claims of legi&s;lation. To &s;et this matter in as clear a light as po&s;&s;ible, we &s;hall fir&s;t take a view of the proceedings of parliament, which occa&s;ioned this manife&s;to, and afterwards the re&s;olu|tion of the congre&s;s. This &s;hall nearly be done in the words and &s;tile of the debates and &s;peeches in both hou&s;es. The &s;ubject is copious, and though it is a|bridged as much as po&s;&s;ible, yet it &s;till will appear bulky to the view of many, but it will be impo&s;&s;ible to under&s;tand the merits of this controver&s;y without
<PB N="92" REF="93">&s;ome particular con&s;ideration of the tran&s;actions at home. To determine fairly with re&s;pect to this unhap|py di&s;pute, the &s;prings of action mu&s;t always be kept in view and the&s;e we only can learn from the various proceedings and debates which were antecedent to the operations of the different &s;hips of war. Admini|&s;tration was now &s;o clo&s;ely entangled in the American war, and a &s;y&s;tem of their own devi&s;ing, that there was &s;carcely a po&s;&s;ibility of overthrowing the one without overthrowing the other: and that &s;y&s;tem was &s;o firmly &s;upported, that nothing le&s;s than &s;ome ex|traordinary and violent convul&s;ion appeared even ca|pacle of &s;haking its foundation. Yet notwith&s;tand|ing of this &s;ecurity, the mini&s;try could not help feel|ing great unea&s;ine&s;s at the accounts that were daily received from the colonies during the &s;itting of parli|ament. For though oppo&s;ition were not very &s;trong in number, they were very quick &s;ighted in di&s;cover|ing their faults, and as indefetigable in expo&s;ing them, and having effect through all their winding mazes up to their cau&s;es. Matters were now come to that pa&s;s that it was &s;carcely po&s;&s;ible to put a good face on them either to the parliament or to the nation. The mi|ni&s;try were on this occa&s;ion put to their la&s;t &s;hifts to make things appear with any decem$$$nd of grace to the public.</P>

<P>THE calling of a new parliament had rubbed off &s;ome mini&s;terial incumbrances; all engage|ments, promi&s;es, and mi&s;takes with the old were now obliterated with one da&s;h. But a new and heavy reckoning had already been contracted in one &s;e&s;&s;ion, which had elap&s;ed, of that pre&s;ent parliament. The re&s;training bills pa&s;&s;ed by the new parliament were to have affixed a &s;eal to all the acts of its predece&s;&s;ors. The general di&s;tre&s;s ari&s;ing from a general puni&s;h|ment in the colonies, would, it was hoped, render the majority the avengers of the cau&s;e of government, and the puni&s;hers of the incorrigible. The concilia|tory re&s;olution, independent of every other thing, in its double capacity of converting and dividing, was &s;uppo&s;ed well adapted to accompli&s;h all that was wanted. To the&s;e was al&s;o added, an army &s;ufficient as the &s;anguine opinion to look America into &s;ubjec|tion, without the trouble of &s;triking a blow. And to
<PB N="94" REF="95">crown the whole, a naval force was to be &s;ent, which of it&s;elf would be almo&s;t equal to accompli&s;h the whole purpo&s;e. Time has already &s;hewn how badly the mini&s;try have been acquainted with the &s;tate of the Americans.</P>
<P>The&s;e branches of the &s;cheme of the mini&s;try be|came a &s;ubject of animadver&s;ion, and it was not an ea|&s;y ta&s;k for their friends to &s;et a&s;ide the charges of mi&s;|information, ignorance, mi&s;conception, and want of capacity, which would attend them. The que&s;tions concerning the war were exceedingly embarra&s;&s;ing. It was a&s;ked, &s;ince extremities were determined upon, why was not a &s;ufficient force &s;ent in time to prevent or overcome all oppo&s;ition? Why has a cour&s;e been pur&s;ued for &s;everal years to provoke the colonies, warn them of their danger, and give them time to put them&s;elves into the pre&s;ent &s;trong &s;tate of de|fence? If it now appears, &s;aid the oppo&s;ers of the mini&s;try, that five times the number are not &s;ufficient for the &s;ervice, how could the mini&s;ter be &s;o totally ignorant and mi&s;informed as to &s;uppo&s;e that 10,000 men could &s;ubdue America without blood&s;hed?&mdash; Tho&s;e and many other que&s;tions were put to the mi|ni&s;ter, which he could not ea&s;ily an&s;wer.</P>
<P>To remedy the evils ari&s;ing from pa&s;t tardine&s;s and inaction, it was now determined to carry on the war with a vigour that would a&s;toni&s;h all Europe, and to employ &s;uch an army in the en&s;uing campaign as ne|ver before had been &s;een in the we&s;tern world. This was alledged, be&s;ides the main and grand object, would mo&s;t effectually &s;ilence all clamours, and pre|vent troubles and u&s;ele&s;s enquiries. When the peo|ple were once heartily engaged in a war, they would not take time to recollect, much le&s;s to animadvert,
<PB N="95" REF="96">upon the original cau&s;e of the di&s;pute, but would in their u&s;ual manner, and from their natural di&s;po&s;ition, carry it on with keenne&s;s, and if gratified now and then with a brilliant &s;troke of &s;ucce&s;s, take no further notice concerning future burthens and con&s;equences. By this method the public opinion would be &s;ecured; they had already &s;hewn a decided &s;uperiority in par|liament, the efforts of the minority &s;truggling with the general opinion, and directed again&s;t the apparent national intere&s;t, would only tend to render them every day more feeble, and deprive then of that po|pularity that is the &s;oul of oppo&s;ition. This was good enough rea&s;oning for a cabinet exerci&s;e, but the prac|tice of it was not &s;o very ea&s;y. The Americans were now upon their guard, and provided for the wor&s;t they could do, and there were now many things to dim the brilliance of the &s;trokes of &s;ucce&s;s they had in view. As the public opinion depended upon the&s;e brilliant &s;trokes, it was impo&s;&s;ible to gain it before they were made, and as all they had yet done was of a different character, the public could not give them credit for any thing that was yet to come.</P>
<P>There was one thing which greatly &s;hewed the ficklene&s;s and the incon&s;i&s;tency of the people. The late checks which the Americans had given our troops affected the national and military pride. Many of tho&s;e who had not approved of our late conduct with re&s;pect to the colonies, thought it now too late to look back, or to enquire into pa&s;t cau&s;es; They now thought that government was to be &s;upported at all events, and that they were not to he&s;itate at any expence or dan|ger to pre&s;erve our dominions, and whoever was right in the beginning, the American in&s;olence de&s;erved cha&s;ti&s;ement at that pre&s;ent time. This was a method
<PB N="96" REF="97">of rea&s;oning immoral in its nature, and de&s;troyed eve|ry principle of truth and virtue; for if the Ameri|cans were right in the beginning, and we were in the wrong, it would certainly have been a laudable and ju&s;t proceeeding to have confe&s;&s;ed our error, and to have for&s;aken it. But becau&s;e our brethren would not depart from ju&s;tice, rather than confe&s;s our faults and reform our conduct, we would pur&s;ue them to death for their in&s;olence of being virtuous. This &s;ets forth a number of men in a mo&s;t pitiful and di&s;advan|tageous point of view, who throw ju&s;tice and equity out of the que&s;tion, and for the &s;ake of a &s;elfi&s;h policy pur&s;ue the mo&s;t iniquitious and immoral practices.&mdash; We &s;hall &s;ee when we come to the arguments upon the principal merits of this controver&s;y, what has been &s;aid upon this point.</P>
<P>The lo&s;s ari&s;ing from the want of the American commerce was for &s;ome time not felt. The prodigi|ous remittances in corn during our &s;carcity, which, we mu&s;t do the commercians the ju&s;tice to &s;ay, they with hone&s;ty made in di&s;charge of their debts, with the much larger than their u&s;ual &s;um which they were enabled to pay, from the advanced prices of oil and tobacco, and other commodities, all together occa&s;ion|ed a prodigious influx of money. The &s;ailing of the flota from Spain, the armament again&s;t Algiers, and the peace between the Turks and the Ru&s;&s;ians, occa|&s;ioned an unu&s;ual demand for goods and manufactures of various &s;orts, from Spain, the north of Europe, and Turkey, which keeping up a bri&s;k circulation in trade, bu&s;ine&s;s and money, all contributed to the &s;ame ef|fect. The &s;upplying of an army and navy with provi|&s;ions and nece&s;&s;aries of every &s;ort, at &s;o prodigious a di&s;tance, gave employment and emolument to an infi|nite

<PB N="97" REF="99">number of people engaged in the tran&s;port &s;er|vice, which would have been otherwi&s;e idle, and cau&s;ed &s;uch a bu&s;tle of bu&s;ine&s;s and circulation of ca&s;h, as checked all ob&s;ervation of other deficiencies, and &s;tifled all attention to future con&s;equences. A golden harve&s;t was not only opened to the view of contrac|tors, but they had already enjoyed &s;uch a &s;hare of the fruits, as was &s;ufficient to excite the mo&s;t eager rage for its continuance and renewal. It would be &s;uper|fluous to mention the numberle&s;s dealers and gambel|lers in the lottery &s;tocks, and other money tran&s;ac|tions, who generally profit by all wars. The&s;e con|tributed for a &s;ea&s;on to keep up the &s;pirit of the peo|ple, and to animate them to this civil contention.&mdash; This temporary flow of the &s;pirits of &s;ome individu|als in the nation could not animate the whole body, nor long continue to flow in the &s;ame manner in the &s;ame per&s;ons. It was no more than a &s;ort of tempo|rary impul&s;e ari&s;ing from an accidental cau&s;e, which was &s;oon likely to cea&s;e, when a con&s;umption equal to the irregularity of the former motion of &s;pirits in the body politic would readily happen. The Ame|rican We&s;t Indian and African merchants, with the planters in the We&s;t Indies, had long fore&s;een, and al|ready too deeply experienced the fatal effects of the pre&s;ent unhappy conte&s;t. They with &s;everal mer|chants in the capital and Bri&s;tol, &s;till wi&s;hed and &s;truggled to have matters re&s;tored to their ancient &s;tate, and reprobated all the mea&s;ures that tended to the pre&s;ent cri&s;is.</P>
<P>A great number of the people in other places, tho' le&s;s loud in their demand for peace, &s;till were di&s;&s;a|tisfied with the pre&s;ent mea&s;ures. In Ireland almo&s;t
<PB N="98" REF="100">all the people, except a few pen&s;ioners or &s;ome of the clergy, were again&s;t the mea&s;ures of government.</P>
<P>There was a &s;trange indifference and want of feel|ing prevailed at this time among all ranks of people, with regard to public affairs, through all the country; of which there was a &s;trong proof given which will readily recur to every's body's memory, that the ac|counts of many of the late military tran&s;actions, as well as political proceedings of very great importance, were received with as much indifference, and canva&s;|&s;ed with as much coolne&s;s and unconcern, as if they had happened to two nations with which they were no ways connected. We mu&s;t from the&s;e ob&s;erva|tions except the people of Scotland, who almo&s;t uni|ver&s;ally, &s;o far as they could be de&s;cribed or di&s;tin|gui&s;hed under any particular denomination, not only applauded, but offered their lives and fortunes in &s;up|port of the pre&s;ent mea&s;ures. The &s;ame approba|tion was al&s;o given, and a&s;&s;urances made, tho' with le&s;s earne&s;tne&s;s and unanimity by a great number of towns in England. One thing which may be con&s;ider|ed as a political barometer with re&s;pect to the &s;enti|ments of the lower ranks of people in ca&s;es of that nature, was at this time exceedingly low, namely, the recruiting &s;ervice. This went on &s;lowly, and very few either in England or Ireland were fond of either the land or &s;ea &s;ervice, though great encouragement was given, and no means was left untried for making of extraordinary levies. In the mid&s;t of all the&s;e po|litical commotions, the city of London made a capital figure in oppo&s;ition to the mini&s;try and the mea&s;ures which they were now pur&s;uing. A petition and re|mon&s;trance was agreed upon by the livery of that ci|ty, which &s;trongly reprobated the mea&s;ures that were
<PB N="99" REF="101">going on, but as the King would not receive it upon his throne, it was not pre&s;ented.</P>
<P>Some &s;hort time before the&s;e tran&s;actions of the city of London which related to the petition and re|mon&s;trance, a letter was recieved from the commit|tee of New York, addre&s;&s;ed to the Lord Mayor, Al|dermen, and common council, together with a copy of their a&s;&s;ociation, a recital of mo&s;t of tho&s;e grievan|ces and complaints which we have often taken notice of in this hi&s;tory. In this paper they rejected and cen&s;ured &s;everely Lord North's conciliatory propo&s;i|tions. They declared that the colony was willing and ready according to the ancient con&s;titution, and upon equitable emergencies, to contribute to the &s;upport of the empire; but al&s;o declared, that as Engli&s;hmen they would do it of their voluntary gift, and not by arbitrary compul&s;ion. They te&s;tified their fidelity and inviolable loyalty, with their affection to their coun|try; they &s;tated the great danger of further provoca|tion with re&s;pect to the colonies, declaring the unani|mity of their citizens in defending their rights at all ri&s;ques, and they &s;ignified their confidence and tru&s;t in the vigorous exertions of the city of London to|wards re&s;toring union, mutual confidence, and peace to the whole empire. All the&s;e proceedings mark|ed the &s;pirit and temper of the people both at home and in the colonies, but the mini&s;try being bent upon their own &s;chemes, remained callous to all notices, advice, petitions, remon&s;trances, and exhortations.&mdash; It appears that this was to them and their party the hour and power of darkne&s;s.</P>
<P>The officers in the army were not altogether fond of the American war; &s;ome per&s;ons of the fir&s;t rank who had commi&s;&s;ions, re&s;igned and refu&s;ed to, &s;erve
<PB N="100" REF="102">any longer in a &s;ervice &s;o unnatural in it&s;elf and ru|inous to the Briti&s;h empire. Among the&s;e the Earl of Effingham made the fir&s;t figure. This nobleman who&s;e military genius had led him when a youth in|to the army, and &s;ince prompted him to ripen theory with practice, whereever real &s;ervice was to be found, by acting as a volunteer in the war between the Turks and Ru&s;&s;ians, had &s;ince his return, as a peer in parliament, uniformly oppo&s;ed the whole &s;y&s;tem of mea&s;ures pur&s;ued again&s;t the Americans, and finding that it was incon&s;i&s;tent with his character and unbecoming his dignity to inforce the mea&s;ures with his &s;word which he had utterly condemned as a legi&s;|lator. He accordingly, after declaring his readine&s;s to &s;erve his King and country again&s;t their enemies, re&s;igned his commi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>The Earl of Effingham's re&s;ignation, or rather the cau&s;e from which it proceeded, gave great offence, and his reque&s;t of retaining his rank in the army was not complied with. Several officers had not &s;hewn that willingne&s;s in going upon this &s;ervice that they would have &s;hewn upon any other occa&s;ion. A few who could not overcome their repugnance to it, now quitted and gave up. But the majority thought that where the &s;uperior power of King and parlia|ment had decided, it was no part of their military du|ty to enquire into the ju&s;tice and policy of the quar|rel. The conduct of Lord Effingham rendered him extremely popular among tho&s;e who held &s;imilar opi|nions with regard to American mea&s;ures, and who compo&s;ed a numerous body in England and Ireland. This &s;oon appeared in the city of London, where a|mong the re&s;olutions pa&s;&s;ed in the common hall on
<PB N="101" REF="103">Mid&s;ummer day, and which were afterwards pre&s;ent|ed to the King, public thanks were ordered to be given to the Right Honourable the Earl of Effingham, who having con&s;i&s;tently with the principles of an Eng|li&s;hman, refu&s;ed to draw the &s;word which has been employed to the honour of his country, again&s;t the lives and liberties of his fellow-&s;ubjects in America. And &s;oon after an addre&s;s of thanks, but &s;till in &s;trong|er terms, was pre&s;ented to him from the guild of mer|chants in Dublin.</P>
<P>This la&s;t body, who in Dublin form a corporation, pre&s;ented al&s;o an addre&s;s of thanks to the &s;everal peers, who, as they ob&s;erve, in &s;upport of the con&s;ti|tution and in oppo&s;ition to a weak and wicked admini|&s;tration, prote&s;ted again&s;t the American re&s;training bills. This addre&s;s to the prote&s;ting Lords, to which was affixed the corporation &s;eal, was &s;ent to each &s;e|parately, and a &s;eparate an&s;wer given, all of which were publi&s;hed at that time. The &s;heriffs and com|mons of the city of Dublin had for &s;ome time endea|voured to obtain the concurrence of the Lord May|or and board of aldermen, in a petition to the throne again&s;t the mea&s;ures pur&s;ued with re&s;pect to the colo|nies, but were an&s;wered by the latter upon their fir&s;t application that the matter was of the highe&s;t im|portance, and therefore inexpedient. Upon a &s;ub|&s;equent occa&s;ion however they &s;eem to have concur|red in the mea&s;ure, as a committee of &s;ix aldermen, with as many commoners, and the recorder, were ap|pointed to draw up a petition and addre&s;s. This ta&s;k being at la&s;t accompli&s;hed, was arre&s;ted in its pro|gre&s;s by a negative from the mayor and aldermen.&mdash; This occa&s;ioned a di&s;pute between the &s;he|riffs
<PB N="102" REF="104">and commons, and the mayor and court of al|dermen, which was carried on with great warmth, and ended in &s;ome &s;erious re&s;olutions and declarations.</P>
<P>The impo&s;&s;ibility of purcha&s;ing and providing for negroes which the pre&s;ent di&s;pute had occa&s;ioned in our We&s;t India i&s;lands, together with the lo&s;s of the American markets for &s;laves, and the impediment cau&s;ed by the proclamations of council again&s;t the ex|portation of arms and ammunition, had, altogether, nearly extingui&s;hed our American trade. This lo&s;s was more particularly felt by the port of Liverpool, which had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a much greater part of that com|merce, than any other in the kingdom. When the Guinea &s;hips arrived, they were laid up, in an uncer|tainty of their &s;uture di&s;po&s;ition, while their crews looked in vain for other employment. As the branch|es of commerce were al&s;o &s;lackened in a great degree, and that the crews of the Greenland &s;hips upon their return in July and the beginning of Augu&s;t, were ac|cording to cu&s;tom di&s;charged the number of &s;eamen out of employment in that town became great, and ac|cording to &s;ome calculations amounted to near 3000.</P>
<P>In this &s;ituation the &s;eamen complained that an at|tempt was made by the merchants to lower their wa|ges, in con&s;equence of which a violent commotion was rai&s;ed among them, in which they cut the rigging of &s;ome &s;hips to pieces, a&s;&s;aulted &s;ome hou&s;es, and committed other acts of violence. They at la&s;t di&s;|per&s;ed, and all became quiet. But they &s;eizing a num|ber of them, and &s;ending them to pri&s;on, rekindled the flame with greater violence, &s;o that nothing could have been expected but the de&s;truction of that flou|ri&s;hing town. The &s;ailors immediately a&s;&s;embled, pro|cured not only fire arms, but cannon, and were pro|ceeding
<PB N="103" REF="105">to the de&s;truction of the pri&s;on, when its &s;afe|ty was procured by the enlargement of their compa|nions. But their rage was too much heated by li|quor to be appea&s;ed by conce&s;&s;ions. They not only proceeded to de&s;troy the hou&s;es of obnoxious per|&s;ons, but marched in a body to demoli&s;h the exchange. The exchange was barricaded, &s;hut up, and defend|ed by the merchants and town &s;men, and &s;ome lives were lo&s;t upon this occa&s;ion; but the arrival of &s;ome light hor&s;e put an end to this di&s;order. In a &s;hort time there was &s;ufficient employment found for the &s;ailors in the King's &s;ervice.</P>
<P>About this time Mr Penn, late Governor, and one of the proprietors of Penn&s;ylvania, arrived from thence with a petition from the general congre&s;s to the King, which he pre&s;ented through the hands of the Earl of Dartmouth. During the time that this petition hung in &s;u&s;pence, the mo&s;t &s;anguine hopes were formed by tho&s;e who were earne&s;t for peace, or friends to America, that it would have led to an happy reconciliation, e&s;pecially as it had already tran&s;pired that it contained expre&s;&s;ions of the great|e&s;t loyalty, and was couched in the mo&s;t humble and moderate terms. But in proportion as the&s;e hopes were received, was the degree of the di&s;appointment to tho&s;e who &s;o eagerly wi&s;hed for &s;o de&s;irable an event, when they found that Mr Penn was informed that no an&s;wer would be given to his petition. The Americans had al&s;o laid great &s;tre&s;s upon the &s;ucce&s;s of this final application, and were &s;aid to have relaxes their operations con&s;iderably upon that idea, until they heard the event. This petition, which was &s;ub|&s;cribed by all the members of the congre&s;s, was full of expre&s;&s;ions of duty, re&s;pect, and loyalty to the King
<PB N="104" REF="106">and of affection to the parent &s;tate. They attributed all the differences and misfortunes which had hither|to taken place, to a pernicious &s;y&s;tem of government adopted at the end of the la&s;t war, and to the evil de|&s;igns and conduct of mini&s;ters &s;ince that time. They declared that they not only ardently de&s;ired that the former harmony between the mother country and the colonies might be re&s;tored, but that a concord might be e&s;tabli&s;hed between them, upon &s;o firm a ba&s;is as to perpetuate its ble&s;&s;ings, uninterrupted by future differences, to &s;ucceeding generations in both coun|tries. That notwith&s;tanding the &s;ufferings of his Ma|je&s;ty's loyal colonies during the cour&s;e of the pre&s;ent controver&s;y, their brea&s;ts retain too tender a regard to the kingdom from whence they derived their ori|gin, to reque&s;t &s;uch a conciliation as might in any manner be incon&s;i&s;tent with her dignity or her wel|fare. That the&s;e, related as they were to her, ho|nour and duty, as well as inclination, induce them to &s;upport and advance; and the apprehen&s;ions that now oppre&s;s their hearts with un&s;peakable grief being once removed, his Maje&s;ty will find his faithful &s;ubjects on that continent ready and willing at all times, as they have ever been, with their lives and fortunes, to a&s;|&s;ert and maintain the rights and intere&s;ts of his Ma|je&s;ty, and of their mother country.</P>
<P>When this ruinous war and all its con&s;equences are con&s;idered, and the lengths which the parties had pro|ceeded to are remembered, they &s;ugge&s;t a doubt of the &s;ecurity of the &s;entiments that were &s;et forth in this petition. But the following part explains the parti|cular intention of what has ju&s;t now been mentioned. "With all humility &s;ubmitting to your Maje&s;ty's wi&s;e con&s;ideration, whether it may not be expedient for
<PB N="105" REF="107">facilitating the&s;e important purpo&s;es, that your Ma|je&s;ty be plea&s;ed to direct &s;ome mode by which the united applications of your faithful coloni&s;ts to the throne, in pur&s;uance of their common councils may be improved into a happy and permanent reconcilia|tion; and that in the mean time mea&s;ures may be taken for preventing the further de&s;truction of the lives of your Maje&s;ty's &s;ubjects, and that &s;uch &s;ta|tutes as more immediately di&s;tre&s;s any of your Ma|je&s;ty's colonies may be repealed."</P>
<P>Whatever the inward intentions of the parties might be, the language was conciliatory, and the re|que&s;t not immoderate. Such as favoured the plan of pacification by conce&s;&s;ion, complained loudly of Lord Dartmouth's an&s;wer, as calculated to drive the colo|nies to the la&s;t extremities of independence and fo|reign connections: for this reception, they &s;aid, of &s;o dutiful and decent an addre&s;s, amounted to no le&s;s than a renouncing of their allegiance. The friends of the mini&s;try took it in a different light. They granted that the petition had a very decent appear|ance: but then the authority of parliament was not formally acknowledged. They were al&s;o &s;till in arms, and on that account there was no &s;ecurity that they could give that could be relied on. It was &s;aid that they wanted to gain time by a negociation, until they had formed a government, and e&s;tabli&s;hed their &s;trength in &s;uch a manner as would render all efforts for their reduction ineffectual. We had already gone too far in the expense of a war, and &s;hould not now &s;top &s;hort, but reap the benefits to government which always ari&s;e from an un&s;ucce&s;sful rebellion. And be|&s;ides the&s;e great objects of puni&s;hing the obnoxious, and providing for our friends, to rivet, without leav|ing
<PB N="106" REF="108">room for a future conte&s;t, that unconditional &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion upon America, which no treaty or negocia|tion could ever obtain. If amicable terms were en|tered into, all our expence and preparation would be thrown away; we mu&s;t &s;hrink back from our propo|&s;als made to foreign princes for hiring their troops, which would di&s;grace us in their eyes, as our tame|ne&s;s in putting up with the in&s;olence of our own peo|ple, would render us contemptible in the eyes of all Europe; and all that we had done would neither im|pre&s;s the colonies with a &s;en&s;e of our dignity nor with the terror of our power. It was added, that the na|tion was prepared by the language of war for the e|vent, and it was not certain, if the temper of the na|tion was &s;uffered to cool, that the people at another time would be &s;o ready to &s;upport &s;uch an undertak|ing. This favourable di&s;po&s;ition was therefore to be cultivated and employed in the critical moment. This was a part of the mini&s;terial rea&s;oning at that time, and &s;hews the &s;pirit with which they were po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ed.</P>
<P>As the time of the meeting of the parliament drew near, addre&s;&s;es were poured in from all quarters, &s;ome in the mo&s;t violent, and &s;ome in a more moderate &s;tile, but all condemning the conduct of the Ameri|cans, approving of all the acts of government, and in general recommending a per&s;everance in the &s;ame &s;trong mea&s;uures, until the colonies were reduced to a thorough obedience, and brought to a full &s;en&s;e both of their errors and duty. In &s;ome of the&s;e ad|dre&s;&s;es, &s;evere and unju&s;t reflections were thrown forth again&s;t tho&s;e gentlemen who had oppo&s;ed admi|&s;tration in the pre&s;ent American mea&s;ures, who were repre&s;ented as factious and de&s;perate men, and &s;tigma|matized,
<PB N="107" REF="109">as being not only encouragers, but in a great mea&s;ure the authors, of the American rebellion.&mdash; This greatly inflamed the leaders of the minority a|gain&s;t the procurers of the addre&s;&s;es, and only &s;erved to irritate the &s;pirit of oppo&s;ition again&s;t the mini&s;ters and mea&s;ures which the addre&s;&s;es were intended to &s;upport. It is well known with how much difficulty many of the addre&s;&s;es were procured, and how few, after all the diligence of mini&s;terial agents, &s;ub&s;cribed them. All &s;en&s;ible men con&s;idered them as nothing more than the dictates of the mini&s;try, and the &s;ub|&s;criptions forced &s;ignatures or te&s;timonies of the worth|le&s;sne&s;s of the &s;ub&s;cribers. In &s;ome places the &s;ub|&s;cribers con&s;i&s;ted principally of pen&s;ioners, crown of|ficers, and dependents upon &s;ome friends at the court. Some of the&s;e were truly reputable and of an inde|pendent principle of mind, and refu&s;ed to &s;ign &s;uch ad|dre&s;&s;es as their heart could not con&s;ent to. What made &s;ome of tho&s;e addre&s;&s;ers more &s;u&s;picious was, they were generally promoted by &s;uch as were never re|markable for their attachment to the revolution prin|ciples, and who had been deeply involved in an unna|tural rebellion again&s;t King George the Second, in behalf of the pretender. The&s;e were now leading men in promoting the addre&s;&s;es both in England and Scotland, which made tho&s;e who were called whigs &s;u&s;pect that there was &s;ome &s;ecret carrying on, unfriendly to the con&s;titution, and that the American war was only a colour for a deeper &s;cheme, which was excogitated in &s;ecret, and would be revealed when all things were ready for its execution. Peo|ple who were acquainted with the Jacobites through|out the kingdom, and knew &s;omething of their private conver&s;ation, could not but be a&s;toni&s;hed at their
<PB N="108" REF="110">zeal for the pre&s;ent government. It alarmed the friends of the revolution to &s;ee all things put into their hands when they were certain they &s;till held the &s;ame principles which gave occa&s;ion to the revolution. It was &s;aid that they had &s;een their error, and were now friends to government, from a principle of con|viction; but &s;uch as knew them were certain that this was fal&s;e; for in their private cabals, and among their friends, they fully di&s;covered their &s;entiments concerning the <HI>good old cau&s;e.</HI> It gave great ground of &s;u&s;picion that this addre&s;s was a mere delu&s;ion, when the town of Manche&s;ter, remarkable for its re|bellion in the year 1745, took the lead in this pro|ceeding.</P>
<P>The oppo&s;ition on this occa&s;ion &s;et forth the con|duct of the addre&s;&s;ers in the &s;tronge&s;t colours, and per|haps all the charity that was nece&s;&s;ary was not prac|ti&s;ed in their de&s;criptions. It was &s;aid that the ad|dre&s;&s;ers were the legitimate offspring of tory towns, though they &s;prung up accidentally in others from the tory party; and all the reproach of encouraging civil war and deva&s;tation was thrown upon them: and it was added, that di&s;traction at home and di&s;honour a|broad were the con&s;tant effects of the predominance of tory councils. The&s;e charges were laughed at on the other &s;ide, who being &s;trong in the &s;anction of au|thority, turned the tables upon the whigs, and charg|ed them not only with cau&s;ele&s;s oppo&s;ition, but with di&s;affection to government; that if they appeared to &s;upport it for a time, it was only becau&s;e they had rendered it &s;ub&s;ervient to their own faction; but that whenever it was put upon an independent and re|&s;pectable foundation, their eternal enmity could not be concealed. About this time the preachers began
<PB N="109" REF="111">after a long intermi&s;&s;ion to enter upon politics.&mdash; Some of the&s;e di&s;tingui&s;hed by the name of Method|i&s;ts began to revive the doctrines of pa&s;&s;ive obedience and non-re&s;i&s;tance, nearly as it had been a&s;&s;erted in the la&s;t century. By degrees this mode of preaching went higher, and all the jargon of Sir Robert Filmer was retailed in &s;everal pulpits. On the other hand, &s;everal clergymen, e&s;pecially among&s;t the di&s;&s;enters, e&s;pou&s;ed the cau&s;e of liberty with much fervour.&mdash; Among all the champions on either &s;ide of the que&s;|tion, none di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves &s;o much as Dr Price, who profe&s;&s;edly defended civil liberty, upon principles that all his opponents, who have been ve|ry numerous, were never able to confute. Many in|genious things have been &s;aid by Dr John&s;on and Dr Shebbeare, but it is ea&s;y to perceive a pen&s;ion operat|ing through the whole of their di&s;cu&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>The whigs were now divided into two parties, or rather tories, under colour of that name, oppo&s;ed the real whigs. Their di&s;pute took now a new turn.&mdash; The court whigs, as they were called, reproached the other with having abandoned their principles.&mdash; They &s;aid that true whigs were the &s;tronge&s;t &s;upporters, not the mean betrayers, of the rights of parlia|ment. That formerly whigs oppo&s;ed the crown when it &s;et up prerogative in oppo&s;ition to parliament, but that now corrupt degenerate whigi&s;m, maliciou&s;ly and uncon&s;titutionally, oppo&s;ed the crown becau&s;e it act|ed in concurrence with parliament, and in &s;upport of its inherent rights. That tho&s;e whom the oppo&s;ition called tories, (at a time when toryi&s;m is lo&s;t in loyal|ty and love of liberty) were much more de&s;erving the appellation of whigs, than they who now pro&s;tituted its name, and di&s;graced its principles by abetting an
<PB N="110" REF="112">in&s;olent and &s;lavi&s;h rebellion again&s;t the &s;ole guardians of freedom and order.</P>
<P>The other party retorted the&s;e charges with &s;corn. They &s;aid that the court whigs were &s;o fond of their new allies, the tories, that they had perfectly gleaned their opinions, arguments and language, and that they denied toryi&s;m to exi&s;t becau&s;e they had become to|ries them&s;elves. It was a&s;&s;erted that whigi&s;m did not con&s;i&s;t in &s;upporting the power of parliament, or any other power, but of the rights of the people: That as long as parliaments protected the&s;e rights, &s;o long was a parliament &s;acred: But if parliament &s;hould become an in&s;trument of invading them, it was no better in any re&s;pect, and wor&s;e in &s;ome, than any other in&s;trument of arbitrary power; and that the ancient whigs, like the moderns, contended not for names, but for things. They affirmed further, that the tories now, as well as formerly, are true to their principles. They never quarrelled with a parliament of their own party; that is, a parliament &s;ub&s;ervient on the crown, arbitrary, intolerant, and an enemy to the freedom of mankind. That if parliament de&s;troy the liberty of the &s;ubject in America, they are turn|ing its principles every where. They &s;aid, that to be burdened by parliament is not law and liberty, as the tories, in the ma&s;k of whigs, have the effrontery to a&s;&s;ert; but to have the public exigencies judged of, and its contribution a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by a parliament or &s;ome a&s;&s;embly (the name is immaterial) of <HI>its own choice,</HI> this is law and liberty, and nothing el&s;e is &s;o. Such they &s;aw were whig principles; becau&s;e if they were different, the whig principles could not form a &s;cheme of liberty, but would be ju&s;t as &s;lavi&s;h as any that were imputed to the ranke&s;t &s;lavery.</P>
<PB N="111" REF="113">
<P>The nation by this method of rea&s;oning was divid|ed and &s;ubdivided, and for a time became &s;o much en|gaged in debates, that they forgot their own intere&s;ts. Towards the meeting of parliament, they began to revive a little, and to throw off that langour which had for &s;ome time &s;eized them. Petitions now met the addre&s;&s;es from various parts of the kingdom, and it was for &s;ome time doubtful which way the &s;cale would preponderate. From cities of London and Bri&s;tol very long repre&s;entations were pre&s;ented, dwelling chiefly upon the inefficacy of all the late co|ercive and re&s;trictive mea&s;ures; the mi&s;chiefs which were inevitable to our trade from the de&s;truction of the American commerce, and the advantage which our rival neighbours would derive from our divi&s;ions.</P>
<P>The di&s;tre&s;&s;es of the Newfoundland fi&s;hery be|came now an object of attention: government had not con&s;idered a point that every ordinary di&s;cerner might have perceived with half an eye. The Americans by way of retaliation had cut off all provi&s;ions from the fi&s;hers in that part of the world, which threw them into the greate&s;t confu&s;ion, and brought di&s;tre&s;s upon all tho&s;e who were employed by &s;ea or by land. To prevent the dreadful con&s;equence of famine, a number of &s;hips, in&s;tead of being loaded with fi&s;h, were nece&s;&s;arily &s;ent off light to procure flour and pro|vi&s;ions where they were to be found.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, it was computed, that to the value of a full half million &s;terling was left in the bow|els of the deep, and for ever lo&s;t to mankind, by the fir&s;t operations of the fi&s;hery bill. Tho&s;e who were aver&s;e to the American mea&s;ures con&s;idered the cala|mities which fell on the Briti&s;h fi&s;hery as a &s;ort of judg|ment from Heaven again&s;t tho&s;e who made laws to
<PB N="112" REF="114">deprive mankind of the benefits of nature. To the &s;ame cau&s;e they were ready to attribute a dreadful tempe&s;t, the fury of which was chiefly di&s;charged on the &s;hores of Newfoundland. This awful wreck of nature, was as &s;ingular in its circum&s;tances, as fatal in its effects. The &s;ea is &s;aid to have ri&s;en thirty feet almo&s;t in&s;tantaneou&s;ly. Above &s;even hundred boats with their people peri&s;hed, and &s;everal &s;hips with their crews. Nor was their mi&s;chief le&s;s on the land, the waves overpa&s;&s;ing all mounds, and &s;weeping every thing before them. The &s;hores pre&s;ented a &s;hock|ing &s;pectacle for &s;ome time after, and the fi&s;hing nets were hauled up loaded with human bodies.</P>
<P>The circumstances together with the ill &s;ucce&s;s of the la&s;t campaign, and the difficulty of recruiting at home, &s;eemed for a while to ca&s;t a damp upon the &s;pirits which had been rai&s;ed and kept alive with &s;o much indu&s;try, for carrying on the American war. But the court was not di&s;couraged. Through all ob|&s;tacles they proceeded directly to their object. They opened &s;everal negociations on the continent of Eu|rope, in order to &s;upply the deficiency at home. It was however a matter of difficulty to procure the aid they wanted. The greatne&s;s of the di&s;tance, and the adventuring into a new world were terrifying, and rendered the pro&s;pect of return doubtful. Germany was the only open market for that &s;ort of merchan|di&s;e: but the &s;ending of its people to &s;uch a di&s;tance being liable to be con&s;trued as contrary to the con&s;ti|tution of the empire, might have happened to be re|&s;ented by the emperor, or by &s;ome other of the prin|ces of the empire. And provided the opinions or de&s;ires of men, who were con&s;trained to act like ma|chines, had been matters at all to have been con&s;ider|ed, the idea of &s;uch a voyage to an inland people,
<PB N="113" REF="115">who &s;carcely knew the &s;caby report, mu&s;t have been hateful and odious in the highe&s;t degree.</P>
<P>In the&s;e difficulties a negociation is &s;aid to have been &s;et on foot with the court of Peter&s;burgh for 50,000 Ru&s;&s;ians, but without effect. A long negoci|ation was al&s;o carried on at the Hague, for the Scotch Brigades, which had for many years been employed in the Dutch &s;ervice, and always been allowed to be re|cruited from Scotland. The Dutch who con&s;ider their own ca&s;e once to have been the &s;ame with that of the Americans, avoided falling into an incon&s;i&s;ten|cy in helping to oppre&s;s others by rejecting the pro|po&s;al. The Dutch con&s;idered this war as extremely impolitical, and, except tho&s;e in the Scotch intere&s;t, it was generally condemned over all Holland. It is not to the honour of Great Britain, that in all the coun|tries of Europe, in which public affairs are a &s;ubject of either writing or conver&s;ation, the general voice has been in favour of the Americans. It is &s;aid that Vol|taire and Rou&s;&s;eau, who &s;eldom agreed in any one thing, were unanimous in their opinion in behalf of America, and condemned the mea&s;ures of the Briti&s;h mini&s;try. It has been always affirmed by the friends of the mini&s;try, that the oppo&s;ition of their mea&s;ures was frivolous and unrea&s;onable, and proceeded from di&s;affection; but even men and philo&s;ophers quite un|intere&s;ted, have had the &s;ame opinion with tho&s;e that have been &s;o unju&s;tly charged with di&s;&s;affection.</P>
<P>After that the mini&s;try were di&s;appointed in their hopes of a&s;&s;i&s;tance from Holland and Ru&s;&s;ia, they were obliged to apply to the petty German princes for a &s;ufficient number of their &s;lavi&s;h va&s;&s;als to a&s;&s;i&s;t in en&s;laving the colonies. The&s;e little tyrants, who &s;uppo&s;e that their &s;ubjects are made for no other pur|po&s;e but to &s;erve the ends of their ambition, and
<PB N="114" REF="116">&s;upply that beggarly dignity which they affect to &s;up|port, were ready to bring their &s;laves to &s;o good a market, where they were &s;ecured in a &s;ufficient price for them, whether dead or alive, to uphold the taudry &s;plendor of their de&s;potical courts. The princes of He&s;&s;e and Brun&s;wick, and &s;ome others of inferior &s;ig|nificance, furni&s;hed the quotas agreed for, but even the&s;e were &s;till in&s;ufficient to accompli&s;h the &s;anguin|ary purpo&s;e of a mini&s;try that thir&s;ted greedily after blood. It was thought al&s;o nece&s;&s;ary to &s;end five bat|talions of his Maje&s;ty's electoral troops to the garri|&s;ons of Gibraltar, to replace the like number of Eng|li&s;h forces, with an intention to increa&s;e the power of the Briti&s;h army in America. Had the liberties of all Europe been at &s;take, or the Prote&s;tant religion been in the utmo&s;t danger, the government of Britain could not have &s;hewn more anxiety, than they did to have the coloni&s;ts brought to unconditional &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the will of mini&s;ters. In the mid&s;t of all this zeal and diligence to fulfil the ends of their &s;chemes, they were dreadfully thwarted by the hand of Providence, which though they them&s;elves could not or would not perceive it, was ob&s;erved by all the world be&s;ide, who had opportunity to contemplate the events. After providing 5000 oxen, 14,000 &s;heep, and a va&s;t num|ber of hogs, and large quantities of vegetables, toge|ther with 5000 chaldrons of coals, and large abun|dance of &s;our crout, with near half a million value of &s;alt provi&s;ions, the wind and weather proved unfavour|able. The fleet was detained upon our coa&s;ts, and to&s;&s;ed about with tempe&s;ts, till the greate&s;t part of the &s;heep and hogs peri&s;hed, &s;o that the channel was &s;trewed with floating carca&s;es of the&s;e animals. The &s;our crout fermented too fa&s;t, and of con&s;equence pe|ri&s;hed. The wind and weather did not prove favour|able
<PB N="115" REF="117">after they cleared the coa&s;t.&mdash;In the mid|&s;eas, wind and weather were particularly unfavoura|ble, and nearer they approached America the wind grew more contrary and tempe&s;tuous. The periodi|cal &s;ands blew full in their teeth, and drove them from the coa&s;t, and &s;everal of them were blown to the We&s;t Indies, where they arrived in great di&s;tre&s;s. Others which were got entangled with the American coa&s;ts, were either taken or &s;eized in tho&s;e harbours and creeks, where they put in for &s;helter. The few that arrived at Bo&s;ton were prodigiou&s;ly &s;hattered, and their cargoes &s;uffered greatly. Very little of the va&s;t provi&s;ion, procured at an enormous, expence ar|rived at the place of its de&s;tination.</P>
<P>The account of the&s;e di&s;a&s;ters rendered the mini&s;try &s;till more unpopular, and the nation con&s;idered the&s;e misfortunes as much to proceed from mi&s;management as from accidental cau&s;es. They perceived that nei|ther the &s;ea&s;on of the year, nor the cour&s;e of the winds had been taken into the &s;cheme of the mini&s;try; that they had &s;ent away the fleets at an improper &s;ea|&s;on, as if they intended to throw all the provi&s;ions in|to the &s;ea, and wantonly to wa&s;te the &s;ub&s;tance of the nation. Their policy had failed in almo&s;t every thing, and their &s;chemes were all abortive. Finding that the nation was more and more di&s;gu&s;ted with their proceedings, they wanted to turn the views of the people to &s;ome new object. Nothing is more ready to attract the attention, and affect the minds of per|&s;ons of any failing, than objects of di&s;tre&s;s: the huma|nity of this country was now addre&s;&s;ed in behalf of tho&s;e who had &s;uffered in the American war, and a &s;ub&s;cription was opened about the end of the year, for the relief of the &s;oldiers at Bo&s;ton, and of the wi|dows and children of tho&s;e that were &s;lain. The
<PB N="116" REF="118">&s;cheme was mo&s;t liberally &s;upported, and &s;everal thou&s;and pounds were &s;ub&s;cribed in a &s;hort time. That part of the &s;cheme that related to the &s;oldiers was con&s;idered as by no means an act of charity; for as government had received money to &s;upply the troops, it was thought fit they &s;hould be &s;upplied therewith, without begging from the public. Many therefore witheld their bounty both on that ac|count, and al&s;o out of principle, becau&s;e they would not have an hand in carrying on &s;o unju&s;t and un|righteous as war, as they con&s;idered this to be. O|thers thought too much had been &s;pent already, and therefore refu&s;ed to give any &s;upport to a &s;cheme that only would in the end ruin the nation. To move the &s;ympathy of the nation, &s;ome &s;hips were loaded with maimed &s;oldiers, their wives and children, in the mo&s;t wretched condition. The pre&s;ent was a mo&s;t pitiful &s;pectacle; and exerted the humanity of the benevo|lent. This was the fir&s;t ocular demon&s;tration that we had at home that the Americans could fight. We had been told that the provincials would not &s;tand, that they run away at the &s;ight of our men; and few of our &s;oldiers were either killed or wounded. But now the que&s;tion was in every one's mouth, who wounded and maimed them in &s;uch a manner? Hence it began to be believed, even at home, that the colo|ni&s;ts would fight, and that our lo&s;s had been greater than the mini&s;try had told us. This &s;ub&s;cription was con&s;idered as a &s;ort of political touch&s;tone, and the degree of attachment to government was &s;uppo&s;ed to be mea&s;ured by the extent of the bounty.</P>
<P>The mini&s;try were now at their la&s;t &s;hift with re gard to means to be u&s;ed to keep the &s;pirit of the people in favour of the American war. Con&s;piracies were contrived to throw reproach upon the lords
<PB N="117" REF="119">and gentlemen in oppo&s;ition to the mea&s;ures of go|vernment, and the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed noblemen and gentlemen were pointed at. They were charged with being the incendiaries, who by their dark and wicked practices had kindled the war. This kind of &s;tile was crammed into many addre&s;&s;es, and the news|papers were indu&s;triou&s;ly filled with it. It was confi|dently a&s;&s;erted in the&s;e mini&s;terial vehicles of &s;candal and abu&s;e, that a very great number of letters from the mo&s;t con&s;iderable peers and members of parlia|ment had been intercepted, and were actually in the hands of government. The&s;e it was &s;aid would be laid before The council of the nation, when the tower would be &s;peedily fitted with per&s;ons of rank, and a rich harve&s;t of impeachments and puni&s;hments &s;uc|ceed. This &s;candal was carried &s;o far, that it was &s;aid, a number of the members of both hou&s;es who were de&s;cribed and under&s;tood, would not venture to attend their duty in parliament at the meeting there|of. The&s;e were impotent malicious &s;hifts, which ge|nerally attend a weak cau&s;e, and are never practi&s;ed unle&s;s by de&s;perate and wicked men. They always &s;ugge&s;t the crimes which they accu&s;e others of, and &s;ometimes put into the minds of bad men, to do what they never would have thought of.</P>
<P>At the opening of the &s;e&s;&s;ion of parliament, an ex|traordinary report of a con&s;piracy went abroad, which at fir&s;t &s;eemed alarming, but in the end appear|ed as full of folly as it was of wickedne&s;s. This mat|ter is &s;o well known, and was &s;o fully &s;et forth in the gazette and other papers, that it is needle&s;s to en|large upon it. It may &s;uffice to ob&s;erve, that Mr Sayre, a banker in London, and an American by birth, was accu&s;ed of a de&s;ign of &s;eizing the per&s;on of the King, to convey him out of the nation, and then
<PB N="118" REF="120">overturn the government. The means &s;aid to have been provided for this end were &s;o inadequate, that it could hardly have entered into the minds of any per&s;on $n the u&s;e of their rea&s;on, either to have con|trived &s;uch a &s;cheme, or to have believed the exi&s;tence of &s;uch a contrivance. The conclu&s;ion of this mat|ter demon&s;trated the folly and wickedne&s;s of the a|gents, and the di&s;tre&s;s of government for &s;chemes to divert the minds of the people from brooding upon their blunders and mi&s;management. It never hap|pens under wi&s;e governments that &s;uch inadequate means are propo&s;ed to an&s;wer &s;uch purpo&s;es, in all &s;tates where they have ranked among the follies and infirmities of the &s;tates, or &s;tate&s;men who have pur|&s;ued them. And this feeble device to &s;candalize the patriots, will &s;tand po&s;ted among the follies of the Briti&s;h mini&s;try for this year, in all the records where it is mentioned. Tho&s;e who were in the oppo&s;ition to the mea&s;ures of the mini&s;try, held his Maje&s;ty's per&s;on as &s;acred as his mo&s;t intimate cabinet friends, and in all things that belonged to his real honour would have ventured more than tho&s;e who accu&s;ed them of di&s;&s;affection. Tho&s;e who are guilty of giv|ing princes bad council, are never tho&s;e that can &s;afely be tru&s;ted in the time of imminent danger. Since the days of Floddenfield, one hone&s;t man like the Earl of Douglas, is worth all the nobles of a na|tion for the &s;afety and honour of a Sovereign.</P>
<P>The &s;peech from the throne fully declared the re|&s;olution of the cabinet, and nothing but war and un|conditional &s;ubmission was propo&s;ed to the coloni&s;ts. The various addre&s;&s;es echoed the &s;ame doctrine, and the majority in parliament confirmed what&s;oever the mini&s;try propo&s;ed. The minority made a good de|fence, and oppo&s;ed with much &s;pirit the addre&s;s that
<PB N="119" REF="121">was propo&s;ed to be made to the King's &s;peech. The &s;peech was taken to pieces, and every part of it mo&s;t &s;everely examined. The mini&s;ters were charged with having brought their &s;overeign into the mo&s;t di&s;|graceful and unhappy &s;ituation of any monarch now living. Their conduct had already wre&s;ted the &s;cep|tre of America out of the hands of their &s;overeign, and now they wanted to attempt impo&s;&s;ibilities, to recover what they had lo&s;t through wantonne&s;s and incapacity. The charge brought again&s;t the colo|ni&s;ts with re&s;pect to their intention of independency from the beginning of the controver&s;y was refuted by arguments which the mini&s;terali&s;ts could not contra|dict. It was affirmed again&s;t them, and they could not refute it, that their accu&s;ing the coloni&s;ts of this de&s;ign was only to cover their own guilt and mi&s;ma|nagement; and that the Americans had not behaved in&s;idiou&s;ly, but fairly and openly in all their transac|tions with government: that they had from the begin|ning told the mini&s;try, openly, hone&s;tly, and boldly, without di&s;gui&s;e or re&s;erve, and declared to all the world, that they would not &s;ubmit to be taxed arbi|trarily by any body of men what&s;oever, where they were not repre&s;ented. They did not whi&s;per nor conceal their &s;entiments in this particular, but had from the beginning &s;poken uniformly the &s;ame language. They had plainly told what they would do if pre&s;&s;ed to the la&s;t extremity, and therefore the mini&s;try were fully informed from the beginning with their whole de|&s;ign. But the accu&s;ations now brought again&s;t them were only mean patched coverings of the nakedne&s;s of ba&s;e actions, which all men that were not lo&s;t to every feeling of human nature would be a&s;hamed of.</P>
<P>The mini&s;try could not at this time pretend that they had gone blindfold into tho&s;e fooli&s;h and ab&s;urd
<PB N="120" REF="122">mea&s;ures which they were bent in pur&s;uing; for they had been warned every &s;e&s;&s;ion of parliament what would be the i&s;&s;ue. Their mea&s;ures &s;eem to have proceeded from wilfulne&s;s and ob&s;tinacy, rather than from ignorance and mi&s;take: they were bent upon bringing the colonies to unconditional &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, with a view to render them &s;ub&s;ervient to arbitrary purpo&s;es of government, to &s;erve their own pa&s;&s;ions and appetites for pen&s;ions and places.</P>
<P>It appears &s;omewhat &s;trange, that at this time, and ever &s;ince, the mini&s;try have thrown the reproach of the ill &s;ucce&s;s of the American war, upon the gentle|men in the oppo&s;ition, when there has never been any thing demanded in parliament for carrying it on, but has been granted according to their own de&s;ires and wi&s;hes. They were indeed forewarned by men who &s;aw more clearly than they either did or would &s;ee, what would be the i&s;&s;ue of &s;uch wild and impolitic mea&s;ures, and were advi&s;ed to de&s;i&s;t from ruining the empire. This was all that the minority ever did, and this was all that they could charge them with in carrying on the American war, or interrupting its intended &s;ucce&s;s. The mini&s;try &s;plit upon a rock which has ruined them all along. They tru&s;ted to the information of their own pen&s;ioned Governors, who having fallen out with the coloni&s;ts, were care|ful to mi&s;repre&s;ent them, and to deceive their ma&s;ters for the &s;ake of their own emolument and advantage. The&s;e hirelings of State were now &s;o &s;oured by the opposition of the people to their mea&s;ures and de&s;igns, and had met with &s;uch di&s;appointments, that their whole information to government was dictated by a fettled revenge.</P>
<PB N="121" REF="123">
<P>The de&s;ign of bringing in foreign troops occa&s;ioned a long and &s;evere debate in parliament. This mea|&s;ure was cen&s;ured both as illegal and impolitical. To bring in a foreign force into the Briti&s;h dominions was con&s;idered contrary to the law of the land, and ex|po&s;ing our own weakne&s;s; and moreover &s;hewed a de&s;ign in government, rather than not rule ab&s;olutely over their own &s;ubjects, to cringe to German &s;laves, to help them to &s;upport their tyranny. It was &s;aid, that tho&s;e who would not hear the rea&s;onable reque&s;ts of their own &s;ubjects, were now turned &s;uppliants to petty &s;tates for aid to &s;upport their arbitrary mea|&s;ures.</P>
<P>There are times of general infatuation, when even tho&s;e who di&s;approve of the public mea&s;ures that tend to ruin them, gave them as much &s;upport as if they were conducted with the greate&s;t wi&s;dom, and were calculated to promote their true intere&s;ts. Tho' the country gentlemen in parliament were called up|on to mind their own intere&s;ts and to oppo&s;e tho&s;e &s;teps of the mini&s;try which led to the ruin of the nation, yet they &s;till voted with the court, and divided in general with the mini&s;ter. They were a&s;ked if they would for ever &s;uffer their eyes to be blinded, and not &s;uffer them&s;elves to &s;ee the de&s;truc|tive mea&s;ures that were carrying on, without once he&s;itating or reflecting upon the common ruin in which they were involving them&s;elves and the whole nation? Would they &s;till follow without examination or enqui|ry, tho&s;e leaders that had deceived and mi&s;led them in every thing, until they had brought the nation in|to its pre&s;ent di&s;a&s;trous &s;ituation? Had they yet had time to con&s;ider the difficulties attending the &s;upport of 70,000 men, on the other &s;ide the Atlantic? Had they con&s;idered, or made any calculation, how many
<PB N="122" REF="124">thou&s;and tons of &s;hipping would be nece&s;&s;ary for their conveyance and for their &s;upport, or what the expence might amount to, of &s;upplying them from Smithfield market, with vegetables, and all other nece&s;&s;aries from London and its neighbourhood.&mdash; The&s;e were matters of &s;erious con&s;ideration. The land tax was to be rai&s;ed to four &s;hillings in the pound and the mo&s;t &s;anguine imagination could &s;carcely hope that ever it would be again lowered, even &s;up|po&s;ing the mo&s;t fortunate change of circum&s;tances.&mdash; Many arguments were u&s;ed by the minority to &s;hew the pre&s;ent evils, and future bad tendency of carry|ing on the American war; but the mini&s;try were &s;o full of their own &s;cheme of &s;ubjugating the coloni&s;ts, that they would li&s;ten to no advice, however &s;alutary. The&s;e di&s;putes proceeded from the King's &s;peech, and they are &s;o long and tedious, that to give them at full length would be irk&s;ome to the reader. It is &s;ufficient to ob&s;erve, that the debates were princi|cipally carried on for and again&s;t an addre&s;s to the King, on account of the &s;peech from the throne. The amendment propo&s;ed by the minority was rejected by the majority, and the original que&s;tion carried for the addre&s;s without a divi&s;ion.</P>
<P>The next topic of debate was concerning the &s;ending of Hanoverian troops to Gibraltar. In this debate, the friends of the mini&s;ter were divided in their opinion; even tho&s;e who had warmly &s;upported the American war oppo&s;ed this mea&s;ure, and when the mea&s;ure came to be debated, the mini&s;ter found many of tho&s;e he thought were his friends joined with tho&s;e in the oppo&s;ition. It was in&s;i&s;ted upon in the mo&s;t peremptory terms, that the mea&s;ure was ille|gal and uncon&s;titutional in the la&s;t degree; that it was repugnant and &s;ubver&s;ive of the principles of the
<PB N="123" REF="125">bill of rights; that it would e&s;tabli&s;h a precedent of a mo&s;t alarming and dangerous tendency, as it recog|nized a right in the crown to introduce foreigners in|to Britain, and to rai&s;e armies without the con&s;ent of parliament; that it was &s;till more alarming, and re|quired the more immediate reprobation, from its be|ing wanton and unnece&s;&s;ary in point of policy, and from its being &s;o &s;trenuou&s;ly defended by the mini&s;ters, both of which afforded too much room for apprehen|&s;ion, that its avowed purpo&s;es covered others of a ve|ry different nature. The mini&s;try vindicated the mea&s;ures upon the plea of nece&s;&s;ity, and the ground of precedent, namely, that of the Dutch troops being brought into England in the year 1745. It was al&s;o in&s;i&s;ted upon as thoroughly legal and con&s;titutional, and the crown lawyers endeavoured to re&s;train the con&s;truction of the bill of rights, by &s;hewing that its operation extended no farther than this i&s;land. The mini&s;ter was now pu&s;hed hard, both by &s;ome of his friends and tho&s;e who had been uniformly in the op|po&s;ition, to &s;hew his real intention in propo&s;ing &s;uch a clau&s;e in the addre&s;s to the King, as hinted that they con&s;idered it as a favour to have Hanoverian troops &s;ent to Gibraltar, and wanted him to give a&s;|&s;urance, that if the addre&s;s was &s;uffered to pa&s;s in that form, that he would on &s;ome future day to be appointed, bring the legality of the mea&s;ure under the con&s;ideration of the Hou&s;e. The mini&s;ter was however ab&s;olutely inflexible upon that point. He con&s;idered this peevi&s;hne&s;s of his party as de&s;erving rather reprehen&s;ion than indulgence. They could obtain no direct an&s;wer from him; and at length, when he could no longer &s;hift an an&s;wer, he &s;aid, with an apparent indifference, which he &s;uppo&s;ed would intimidate the de&s;erters, that another time
<PB N="124" REF="126">would afford a fitter opportunity of di&s;cu&s;&s;ing the &s;ub|ject than the pre&s;ent. Many of the country gentle|men con&s;idered this &s;teadine&s;s of the mini&s;ter as ex|ceedingly ill timed; but he had as much intere&s;t and addre&s;s as to &s;et matters to right for the pre&s;ent, and got the threatened &s;torm put over.</P>
<P>One particular circum&s;tance which attended the&s;e debates, was the defection of General Conway from admini&s;tration, who after expre&s;&s;ing his utmo&s;t de|te&s;tation of that mini&s;terial principle, that per&s;ons hold|ing places mu&s;t implicitly &s;upport government in all ca&s;es what&s;oever, and however contrary to their prin|ciples; he then condemned in the mo&s;t deci&s;ive terms the American war, which he declared to be cruel, un|natural, and unnece&s;&s;ary; calling it in plain terms a butchery of his fellow &s;ubjects, and to which his con|&s;cience forbad him to give a&s;&s;ent. He condemned e|very idea of conquering the coloni&s;ts, upon all the rules of ju&s;tice, expediency, and practibility. He &s;poke in the mo&s;t unre&s;erved terms again&s;t the right of taxation, and wi&s;hed to &s;ee the declaratory law re|pealed, though it had been pa&s;&s;ed under his own au&s;|pices, when in admini&s;tration; and though on ab&s;tract legal principles he thought it right, and at the time of pa&s;&s;ing proper and nece&s;&s;ary, rather than it &s;hould be employed to colour de&s;igns the mo&s;t oppo&s;ite to the intentions publicly declared of tho&s;e who &s;upported it in parliament, and particularly oppo&s;ite to tho&s;e of his own at the time of his moving it. He called upon the mini&s;ter to give &s;ome information concerning the &s;tate of affairs in America, that they might know with certainty upon what ground they &s;tood, and were likely hereafter to &s;tand, before they pa&s;&s;ed a bloody addre&s;s which would be a &s;tanding record a|gain&s;t them, and which, notwith&s;tanding the profu&s;ion
<PB N="125" REF="127">of &s;ophi&s;tical arguments, that were now u&s;ed to be palmed upon them, by endeavouring to explain away it &s;ub&s;tance, and to repre&s;ent it only as froth and com|pliment, would not only be found a curb upon, but mu&s;t in a great degree influence their conduct throughout the &s;e&s;&s;ion, notwith&s;tanding any information they might have to the contrary. Some of the country gentlemen likewi&s;e &s;aid, they had gone with the mi|ni&s;ter in the preceding &s;e&s;&s;ion, upon the &s;uppo&s;ition, that he had given them authentic information with regard to America, but now finding by the event that they had been impo&s;ed upon, and totally deceived, it became ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to have a full and clear &s;tate of affairs laid before them, prior to their enter|ing upon any bu&s;ine&s;s upon the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>This matter pre&s;&s;ed very hard upon admini&s;tration, and vexed them exceedingly. The accounts from A|merica were at this time unfavourable; and it was doubtful whether we had any thing left there. The mini&s;ter had influence enough to &s;tave off any particu|lar enquiry concerning information that was in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, but there was as much already gone abroad and publi&s;hed from other &s;ources, as rendered it diffi|cult to account for the failure of &s;ucce&s;s in many in|&s;tances, and to guard again&s;t the cen&s;ure which of cour&s;e attended it. Indirect acknowledgments were made, that matters had not been carried on as could have been wi&s;hed, but where the error lay they could not tell: but that a great force was now to be &s;ent out, which would in&s;ure &s;ucce&s;s, and matters would take a new turn. Thus did the mini&s;try promi&s;e one time after another, without having either any formed plan or de&s;ign that had the &s;malle&s;t probability in them.</P>
<P>The Duke of Grafton at this time de&s;erted the mi|ni&s;try, which alarmed them greatly;&mdash;he gave for a
<PB N="126" REF="128">rea&s;on that they had mi&s;led him by fal&s;e information, and had never given a true account of the &s;tate of A|merican affairs: that they had never given a true ac|count of the facts with regard to the di&s;po&s;ition of the coloni&s;ts, and that he had always been made to believe that matters would never come to an extremity of that nature which had happened, but that an appearance of coer&s;ion was all that was requi&s;ite to e&s;tabli&s;h a re|conciliation, and that the &s;tronger government appear|ed, and the better it was &s;upported, the &s;ooner all di&s;|putes would be adju&s;ted. He declared, that nothing le&s;s than a repeal of all the American laws which had been pa&s;&s;ed &s;ince the year 1763, could now re&s;tore peace and happine&s;s, or prevent the mo&s;t de&s;tructive and fatal con&s;equences&mdash;con&s;equences which could not even be thought of without feeling the utmo&s;t de|gree of grief and horror. In the Hou&s;e of Lords it was fairly proved, upon the Duke of Manche&s;ter's mo|tion concerning the Hanoverian troops, that it was in|con&s;i&s;tent with the bill of rights to bring in foreign troops, without an act of parliament, into any part of the Briti&s;h dominions; and that the doing thereof was di&s;&s;olving the con&s;titution, and &s;etting a&s;ide the laws of the land, whereby the crown was made &s;uperior to all law, and the liberties of the &s;ubject totally over|turned. The debates upon this &s;ubject on this occa|&s;ion were warm, and all the arguments in favour of ar|bitrary power, and tho&s;e again&s;t it, were canva&s;&s;ed a|gain and again. Some lawyers maintained doctrines in defence of the mea&s;ures totally oppo&s;ite to the whole Briti&s;h con&s;titution, for which they were &s;everely re|proved.</P>
<P>After many debates to no purpo&s;e, the e&s;timates for carrying on the war were laid before parliament, and pa&s;&s;ed by a large majority. After this, &s;ome
<PB N="127" REF="129">changes happened in admini&s;tration. The Duke of Grafton re&s;igned the privy &s;eal, and was &s;ucceeded by the Earl of Dartmouth, who was &s;ucceeded by Lord George Germaine. The Earl of Rochford hav|ing retired from bu&s;ine&s;s, was &s;ucceeeded by Lord Weymouth, who had continued out of employment &s;ince his re&s;ignation on the affair of Faulkland's I&s;land. Several other changes happened about this time, according as the humours of the court chanced to operate.</P>
<P>The petition of the congre&s;s, which had been deli|vered to his Maje&s;ty by Mr Penn, became now the &s;ub|ject of a warm debate. A copy of this petition was brought before the Lords, among &s;everal other pa|pers, when a noble Duke in oppo&s;ition ob&s;erved, that he &s;aw Mr Penn below the bar, and moved that he might be examined, in order to e&s;tabli&s;h the authenti|city of the petition, before they entered into any de|bates upon its contents, thereby to obviate the doubts which might ari&s;e upon that head, and be a mean of interrupting their proceedings. This motion alarm|ed the mini&s;try exceedingly. They ea&s;ily perceived that the motion was not merely intended to authenti|cate the petition, but that it extended to laying be|fore the Hou&s;e all the information concerning Ameri|ca, which they could draw from a per&s;on &s;o much ma&s;ter of the &s;ubject as Mr Penn. They objected to the motion in point of order; on its informality; on its want of precedent, being contrary to the e&s;tabli&s;h|ed mode of proceeding; that the bringing in of extra|neous matter by &s;urpri&s;e, and breaking in upon the mo&s;t &s;erious and important deliberations, by &s;uddenly calling their intention off to the examination of wit|ne&s;&s;es, and to new &s;ubjects of di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, would be de|&s;tructive of the order and gravity which always di&s;tin|gui&s;hed
<PB N="128" REF="130">their proceedings. They al&s;o contended that this mea&s;ure would e&s;tabli&s;h a mo&s;t pernicious prece|dent, as it would nece&s;&s;arily follow, that every petition from whatever quarter of the globe, mu&s;t be accompa|nied by evidence to e&s;tabli&s;h its authenticity. They ob&s;erved, that improper que&s;tions might be a&s;ked Mr Penn, which might draw from him what might tend to prejudice him with re&s;pect to his private for|tune and affairs in America; that his evidence might have the &s;ame effect with re&s;pect to others who were friends to government in America, and who, by a pub|lic expo&s;ure of their private conduct in its favour, would be liable to per&s;onal danger, and ruin to their fortunes. The&s;e trifling objections were all an&s;wer|ed in &s;uch a manner, that none of the mini&s;teriali&s;ts could make a reply, but the motion was rejected by a majority of 36 to 22. The nobleman who made the motion, and who is remarkable for his per&s;everence, made another, that Mr Penn be examined at the bar the next day. Tho' this motion could no be de|cently refu&s;ed, yet &s;o di&s;agreeable was every &s;pecies of enquiry to the mini&s;try, that another debate aro&s;e upon it; but it was at length agreed that he &s;hould be examined, at a time appointed, which was the 10th of December.</P>
<P>Many curious particulars came out in the examina|tion of Mr Penn which government would have de|&s;ired never to have been known. He informed the Hou&s;e in the mo&s;t clear and di&s;tinct manner of all the particulars concerning which he was interrogated, and &s;poke with an ingenuity that did him much ho|nor. He informed them concerning what the colo|ni&s;ts intended to do, and what they did not, and a|mong other things, declared that they had no inten|tion
<PB N="129" REF="131">to attempt independency, unle&s;s they were dri|ven to it by the violence of the mother country. He made no he&s;itation in declaring the &s;trength of his own province, and informed them that the colony contained 60,000 men able to carry arms; that of the&s;e 20,000 had entered voluntarily to &s;erve with|out pay, and were armed and embodied before his de|parture. Being a&s;ked concerning that volunteer force, he replied, that it included men of the be&s;t fortune and character in the province, and that it was compo&s;ed generally of men who were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of property, either landed or otherwi&s;e. That an ad|ditional body of 4,500 minute men had &s;ince been rai&s;ed in the province, who were to be paid when cal|led out to &s;ervice. That they had the means and materials of ca&s;ting iron cannon in great plenty; that they ca&s;t bra&s;s cannon in Philadelphia, and that they made &s;mall arms in great abundance and perfection. He concealed nothing that could be of &s;ervice to in|form this nation of what was her intere&s;t and duty to ob&s;erve, concerning the colonies.</P>
<P>After the examination was fini&s;hed, the Duke of Richmond who had propo&s;ed it, made a motion for reconciliation with America upon the footing of the petition, which after a long debate was rejected by a large majority, and matters left to proceed upon the ruinous plan upon which they had been hitherto carried on. It was ea&s;y to perceive that government was determined to pur&s;ue the &s;anguinary mea|&s;ure of reducing the colonies to unconditional &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion in &s;pite of all conviction of the im|po&s;&s;ibility thereof; for though all conciliatory &s;chemes were rejected, the prohibitory act was brought in and &s;upported with great zeal. This bill was a full proof of the lengths they intended to go, and fully &s;hewed the extent of their purpo&s;es. This act
<PB N="130" REF="132">totally forbade all trade and intercour&s;e with the thir|teen united colonies. All property belonging to the Americans whether of &s;hips or goods, on the high &s;eas, or in the harbours, are declared forfeited to the captors, being the officers and crews of his Ma|e&s;ty's &s;hips of war; and &s;everal clau&s;es of the bill were in&s;erted, to facilitate and le&s;&s;en the expence of the condemnation of prizes, and the recovery of prize money. There were &s;everal other clau&s;es in this bill incon&s;i&s;tent with all the rules of ju&s;tice and &s;ound policy, which gave the Congre&s;s a &s;uffi|cient handle in point of argument for proceeding to their act of independency. They were now thrown out of the King's protection, and made rebels and out-laws by a new act of parliament, which was con|&s;idered by them as incon&s;i&s;tent with the &s;everal laws of the con&s;titution; for which rea&s;on it was argued that the compact between the King and the people being thereby di&s;&s;olved by an act of the ruling powers, the people in the colonies were thereby freed from all obligations of obedience, and were again brought back to a &s;tate of nature. There appeared a real want of wi&s;dom and ju&s;tice in this prohibitory bill; for though they had yet no proof that the province of Georgia had acceded to the a&s;&s;ociation, yet that province was included in the bill, and given up by au|thority of parliament to be plundered by every war|&s;hip that &s;hould come upon the coa&s;t. But what was mo&s;t barbarous and ab&s;urd in the re&s;training act was, that all tho&s;e who &s;hould be taken on board any Ame|rican ve&s;&s;els were indi&s;criminately to be compelled without di&s;tinction of per&s;ons to &s;erve as common &s;ailors in our &s;hips of war. This was a refinement in tyranny, which was wor&s;e than death, and which the mo&s;t &s;avage nations had never thought of nor prac|ti&s;ed.
<PB N="131" REF="133">To make pri&s;oners, who &s;hould have the mi&s;|fortune to be taken in this plundering war, fight a|gain&s;t their own families, kindred and countrymen, and after being plundered them&s;elves, to become ac|complices in plundering their brethren, was a &s;tretch of cruelty beyond the invention of heathens, and could only be devi&s;ed by papi&s;ts or jacobites. This cruelty was &s;till heightened by this dreadful circum|&s;tance, that the&s;e unhappy per&s;ons who were thus compelled were &s;ubject to the articles of war, and liable to be &s;hot for de&s;ertion. This devili&s;h and ty|rannical law re&s;embled much the Scotch law of in|qui&s;ition, by which the pri&s;oner was &s;queezed or rack|ed with boots and thumbikins till he di&s;covered all his friends or accomplices, and thereby was made the in&s;trument of the ruin of tho&s;e that were deare&s;t to him, and whom he loved be&s;t. If ever any human creature &s;hall in any age of the world attempt to vin|dicate or colour this law with the varni&s;h of humani|ty, he mu&s;t be by all the friends of human nature con|&s;idered, as allied to a rank of beings who are &s;tran|gers to all idea of mercy and benevolence. To be reduced to &s;uch a condition as this law &s;uppo&s;es, is the la&s;t degree of wretchedne&s;s, and indignity to which human nature can be &s;ubjected. It obliged Engli&s;hmen to practi&s;e a cruelty unknown to the mo&s;t &s;avage nations. Such a compul&s;ion upon pri&s;oners as this bill enforced was never known to be practi&s;ed in any ca&s;e of war or rebellion; and the only examples of this &s;ort that can be produced mu&s;t be found among&s;t pirates, the out laws and enemies of human &s;ociety. The chief author of this tyrranical law may ea&s;ily be traced from a &s;peech of a certain law Lord, who de|clared while the bill was depending, That we were not now to con&s;ider the que&s;tions of original
<PB N="132" REF="134">right or wrong, ju&s;tice or inju&s;tice; we were now en|gaged in a war, and mu&s;t u&s;e our utmo&s;t efforts to ob|tain the ends propo&s;ed by it; we mu&s;t fight or be pur&s;ued; and the ju&s;tice of the cau&s;e mu&s;t give way to our pre&s;ent &s;ituation. To this he applied the la|conic &s;peech of a Scotch &s;oldier of fortune in the &s;er|vice of Gu&s;tavus Adolphus, who pointing to the e|nemy, &s;aid to his men, See you tho&s;e lads; kill them or they will kill you. Such a &s;peech from one of the fir&s;t judges of the nation, &s;hews plainly what ju&s;tice we may expect, provided our juries do not protect us. The &s;evere&s;t puni&s;hment that could be inflicted upon &s;uch an enemy to human nature, would be to confine him to be a perpetual witne&s;s of &s;upreme benevolence and philanthropy. It is &s;ufficient to rou&s;e the re&s;ent|ment of all who have the &s;malle&s;t degree of humanity in them to hear or read &s;uch a &s;peech. It brings to the readers remembrance a &s;peech which Milton puts into the mouth of one of his fallen angels: EVIL, BE THOU MY GOOD.</P>
<P>The coloni&s;ts who had hitherto deferred the pro|ject of independency, which was &s;ugge&s;ted to them by the mea&s;ures of the parliament, were now driven to this mea&s;ure by the violent proceedings that have been already mentioned. They found that they were now to be pro&s;ecuted with all the vengeance that the government could inflict, and that while they remained in a &s;tate of dependance upon Great Bri|tain, no nation could afford them any a&s;&s;i&s;tance. They therefore came to a re&s;olution to declare them&s;elves independent &s;tates, and to renounce all allegiance to the Briti&s;h government, and all political connection with the mother country. In their declaration of inde|pendency they give the rea&s;ons of their proceedings,
<PB N="133" REF="135">and &s;et forth to the world the grievances they had long complained of without being heard. Their own words will be&s;t &s;how their rea&s;ons and sentiments up|on the &s;ubject.</P>

<HEAD>In CONGRESS, July 4, 1776.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">A DECLARATION by the REPRESENTATIVES of the UNITED STATES of America, in General Congre&s;s a&s;&s;embled.</HEAD>
<P>When in the cour&s;e of human events it becomes nece&s;&s;ary for one people to di&s;&s;olve the political bands which have connected them with another, and to a&s;|&s;ume among the powers of the earth the &s;eparate and equal &s;tation to which the laws of nature and of Na|ture's God intitle them, a decent re&s;pect to the opi|nions of mankind requires that they &s;hould declare the cau&s;es which impel them to the &s;eparation.</P>
<P>We hold tho&s;e truths to be &s;elf evident; that all men are created equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights; that among the&s;e are life, liberty, and the pur&s;uit of hap|pine&s;s. That to &s;ecure the&s;e rights, governments are in&s;tituted among men, deriving their ju&s;t powers from the con&s;ent of the governed; and, whenever any form of government becomes de&s;tructive of the&s;e ends, it is the right of the people to alter and aboli&s;h it, and to in&s;titute a new government, laying its foundation on &s;uch principles, and organizing its powers in &s;uch form, as to them &s;hall &s;eem mo&s;t likely to effect their &s;afety
<PB N="134" REF="136">and happine&s;s. Prudence indeed will dictate that go|vernments long e&s;tabli&s;hed &s;hould not be changed for light and tran&s;ient cau&s;es; and accordingly all expe|rience hath &s;hewn, that mankind are more di&s;po&s;ed to &s;uffer, while evils are &s;ufferable, than to right them&s;elves by aboli&s;hing the forms to which they are ac|cu&s;tomed; but, when a long train of abu&s;es and u&s;ur|pations, pur&s;uing invariably the &s;ame object, evinces a de&s;ign to reduce them under ab&s;olute de&s;poti&s;m, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off &s;uch govern|ment, and to provide new guards for their future &s;e|curity. Such has been the patient &s;ufferance of the&s;e colonies, and &s;uch is now the nece&s;&s;ity which con&s;trains them to alter their former &s;y&s;tems of government. The hi&s;tory of the pre&s;ent&mdash;of&mdash;, is a hi&s;tory of repeated injuries and u&s;urpations; all having in direct object the e&s;tabli&s;hment of an ab&s;olute tyr|rany over the&s;e &s;tates. To prove this, let facts be &s;ubmitted to a candid world.</P>
<P>He has refu&s;ed his a&s;&s;ent to laws, the mo&s;t whole|&s;ome and nece&s;&s;ary for the public good.</P>
<P>He has forbidden his governors to pa&s;s laws of im|mediate and pre&s;&s;ing importance, unle&s;s &s;u&s;pended in their operation till his a&s;&s;ent &s;hould be obtained; and, when &s;o &s;u&s;pended, he has utterly neglected to attend them.</P>
<P>He has refu&s;ed to pa&s;s other laws for the accom|modation of large di&s;tricts of people, unle&s;s tho&s;e people would relinqui&s;h the rights of repre&s;entation in the legi&s;lature; a right ine&s;timable to them, and formidable to tyrants only.</P>
<P>He has called together legi&s;lative bodies at places unu&s;ual, uncomfortable, and di&s;tant from the depo&s;i|tory
<PB N="135" REF="137">of their public records, for the &s;ole purpo&s;e of fatiguing them into compliance with his mea&s;ure.</P>
<P>He has di&s;&s;olved Repre&s;entative's Hou&s;es repeated|ly, for oppo&s;ing, with manly firmne&s;s, his inva&s;ions on the rights of the people.</P>
<P>He has refu&s;ed, for a long time after &s;uch di&s;&s;olu|tion, to cau&s;e others to be erected; whereby the le|gi&s;lative powers, incapable of annihilation, have re|turned to the people at large for their exerci&s;e; the State remaining in the mean time expo&s;ed to all the dangers of inva&s;ion from without, and convul&s;ions within.</P>
<P>He has endeavoured to prevent the population of the&s;e States; for that purpo&s;e ob&s;tructing the laws for naturalization of foreigners, refu&s;ing to pa&s;s others to encourage their migrations hither, and rai&s;ing the con|ditions of new appropriations of lands.</P>
<P>He has ob&s;tructed the admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice, by refu&s;ing his a&s;&s;ent to laws for e&s;tabli&s;hing judiciary powers.</P>
<P>He has made judges dependent on his will alone, for the tenure of their offices, and the amount and payment of their &s;alaries.</P>
<P>He has erected a multitude of new offices, and &s;ent hither &s;warms of officers to harra&s;s our people, and eat out their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence.</P>
<P>He has kept among as in times of peace &s;tanding armies, without the con&s;ent of our legi&s;latures.</P>
<P>He has affected to render the military independent of, and &s;uperior to, the civil power.</P>
<P>He has combined with others to &s;ubject us to a ju|ri&s;diction foreign to our con&s;titution, and unacknow|ledged by our laws, giving his a&s;&s;ent to their preten|ded acts of legi&s;lation:</P>

<P>For quartering large bodies of armed troops among us:</P>
<P>For protecting them, by a mock trial, from puni&s;h|ment for any murders which they &s;hould commit on the inhabitants of the&s;e States:</P>
<P>For cutting off our trade with all parts of the world:</P>
<P>For impo&s;ing taxes on us without our con&s;ent:</P>
<P>For depriving us, in many ca&s;es, of the benefit of trial by jury:</P>
<P>For tran&s;porting us beyond &s;eas to be tried for pre|tended offences:</P>
<P>For aboli&s;hing the free &s;y&s;tem of Engli&s;h laws in a neighbouring province, e&s;tabli&s;hing therein an arbi|trary government, and enlarging its boundaries, &s;o as to render it at once an example and fit in&s;trument for introducing the &s;ame ab&s;olute rule into the&s;e colonies:</P>
<P>For taking away our charters, aboli&s;hing our mo&s;t valuable laws, and altering fundamentally the forms of our governments:</P>
<P>For &s;u&s;pending our own legi&s;latures, and declaring them&s;elves inve&s;ted with power to legi&s;late for us in all ca&s;es what&s;oever.</P>
<P>He has abdicated government here, by declaring us out of his protection, and waging war again&s;t us.</P>
<P>He has plundered our &s;eas, ravaged our coa&s;ts, burnt our towns, and de&s;troyed the lives of our peo|ple.</P>
<P>He is, at this time, tran&s;porting large armies of fo|reign mercenaries, to complete the works of death, de&s;olation, and tyranny, already begun with circum|&s;tances of cruelty and perfidy &s;carcely paralleled in the mo&s;t barbarous ages, and totally unworthy the head of a civilized nation.</P>
<PB N="137" REF="139">
<P>He has con&s;trained our fellow-citizens, taken cap|tive on the high &s;eas, to bear arms again&s;t their coun|try, to become the executioners of their friends and brethren, or to fall them&s;elves by their hands.</P>
<P>He has excited dome&s;tic in&s;urrections among&s;t us, and has endeavoured to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers the mercile&s;s Indian &s;avages, who&s;e known rule of warfare is an undi&s;tingui&s;hed de&s;truc|tion of all ages, &s;exes, and conditions.</P>
<P>In every &s;tage of the&s;e oppre&s;&s;ions we have petiti|oned for redre&s;s, in the mo&s;t humble terms; our re|peated petitions have been an&s;wered only by repeat|ed injury.&mdash;A prince, who&s;e character is thus marked by every act which may define a tyrant is unfit to be the ruler of a free people.</P>
<P>Nor have we been wanting in attention to our Bri|ti&s;h brethren. We have warned them frequently of attempts, by their legi&s;lature, to extend an unwar|rantable juri&s;diction over us; we have reminded them of the circum&s;tances of our emigration and &s;et|tlement here; we have appealed to their native ju&s;|tice and magnanimity; and we have conjured them by the ties of our common kindred, to di&s;avow the&s;e u&s;urpations, which would inevitably interrupt our connections and corre&s;pondence. They too have been deaf to the voice of ju&s;tice and con&s;anguin|ity. We mu&s;t therefore acquie&s;ce in the nece&s;&s;ity which denounces our &s;eparation, and hold them, as we hold the re&s;t of mankind, enemies in war, in peace friends.</P>
<P>We, therefore, the repre&s;entatives of the United States of America, in general congre&s;s a&s;&s;embled, ap|pealing to the Supreme Judge of the world, for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the name, and by

<P>THIS &s;ubject was largely debated at home by wri|ters of different characters and capacities.&mdash;The crimes of the coloni&s;ts were painted in the &s;tronge&s;t colours by &s;everal court writers. Their perjury in breaking their oath of allegiance to the King, their ingratitude to the mother country, which had nou|ri&s;hed and brought them up like children were &s;trong|ly repre&s;ented and in&s;i&s;ted upon. The right of Bri|tain to tax them in all ca&s;es what&s;oever was &s;et forth in the &s;tronge&s;t light that the authors were able to re|pre&s;ent it; and di&s;tinctions were devi&s;ed to &s;hew, that all coloni&s;ts when they leave a country mu&s;t be ruled by laws in many ca&s;es different from tho&s;e in the mo|ther country. The lawyers found that the coloni&s;ts po&s;&s;e&s;s no freeholds in the &s;ame manner that the pa|rent &s;tate po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es them, and upon this principle con|cluded, that as the coloni&s;ts were not freeholders, they had no claim of a repre&s;entation more than tho&s;e in Britain who have not freehold e&s;tates.</P>
<P>The friends of the coloni&s;ts con&s;idered this kind of rea&s;oning as unju&s;t, ab&s;urd, and inconclu&s;ive. They in|&s;i&s;ted that the fir&s;t coloni&s;ts carried all the rights of Engli&s;hmen along with them, and were as much Eng|li&s;hmen in New England as in Old England. That they were not bani&s;hed for any crimes they had com|mitted in their own country, nor had they tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed any laws which they were bound to obey; that they had purcha&s;ed lands of the original proprietors, and had received a charter of protection from the mo|ther
<PB N="150" REF="153">country at the expence of their trade and com|merce; and that their obedience to government, and protection from it were reciprocal. It was added, that no people are obliged to obey an authority which refu&s;es to afford them protection when it is in its power to do it, but much le&s;s when it is exerci&s;ed to deprive them of their liberty, and tends to en&s;lave them. That there could be no arbitrary power law|ful where the rulers are not ab&s;olutely perfect; be|cau&s;e the pa&s;&s;ions and appetites of men in the po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion of power will always be ready to make them a|bu&s;e it. That an ab&s;olute and uncontroulable power of the parliament over America could never be found|ed in right or &s;ound policy, till once all the members of both Hou&s;es were endowed with as much wi&s;dom, prudence, and rectitude as would infallibly direct them to command what was mo&s;t conducible to the good of the whole upon plain and &s;elf-evident principles.&mdash; And &s;uppo&s;e they were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the&s;e qualifica|tions they &s;till could have no authority over per&s;ons equally free and wi&s;e, without their own con&s;ent freely given. The rea&s;oners on this &s;ide of the que&s;tion con&s;idered the metaphy&s;ical quirks of court ca&s;ui&s;ts and lawyers, as mean &s;elfi&s;h &s;ubterfuges, calculated to throw mi&s;t upon rea&s;on and common &s;en&s;e, and in all their arguments confined them&s;elves to tho&s;e topics which were intelligible to the meane&s;t capacities.</P>
<P>The principal objects of the war this campaign were the relief of Quebec, and the recovery of Ca|nada, and attack upon the &s;outhern colonies, and the-reduction of New York. Some of the execution of the fir&s;t parts of this plan has been &s;hewn already, and the &s;ucce&s;s which attended them fully &s;et forth. Great hopes were founded upon this la&s;t part of the &s;cheme.
<PB N="151" REF="154">The greate&s;t part of the province of New York is en|clo&s;ed in i&s;lands, which being long and narrow were expo&s;ed on all &s;ides to the ho&s;tilities of our fleets, and to the de&s;cent of our troops, with every advantage in their favour, whil&s;t they continue in a &s;tate of enmity. When reduced, the protection of the &s;hips of war would be as effectual in their pre&s;ervation as their ho&s;tility had been in their reduction. The central &s;i|tuation of this province afforded great advantages. The war could be carried on with equal facility, either in Connecticut and the continent of New York on the ea&s;tern &s;ide, or in New Jer&s;ey and from thence to Penn&s;ylvania on the we&s;tern; or it might have been transferred to and from either place at plea&s;ure. So that this &s;ituation enabled the Briti&s;h commander to pre&s;cribe the &s;cene of action, and to quit it when he had a mind, while if the army was withdrawn from the field, he might by means of the Great North Ri|ver, and the different channels between the i&s;lands and the main land, with his &s;hips and detachments harra&s;s and ruin the adjacent countries; at the &s;ame time that the provincials, however powerful, could make no at|tempt upon the i&s;lands that would not be attended with the greate&s;t di&s;advantages, and liable to the mo&s;t eminent danger. Another great object in view from this &s;ituation was, that provided General Carleton could join General Howe by the North or Hud&s;on's River, they would then cut off all communication be|tween the northern and &s;outhern colonies. To crown the&s;e advantages, Long I&s;land which was con&s;idered as a &s;tore-hou&s;e, for both the fleet and army was to be held for the &s;upply of all nece&s;&s;aries; and it was &s;uppo&s;ed the inhabitants were well-affected to the cau&s;e of government. Some part of this plan of oper|ation
<PB N="152" REF="155">was not &s;o very difficult, but experience proved that the whole &s;cheme was by no means practicable.</P>
<P>The management of this la&s;t part of the plan was committed to Lord Vi&s;count Howe and his brother Sir William Howe, two officers of good characters and known abilities, in whom the nation put much confidence, and the government &s;eemed al&s;o to tru&s;t. A powerful army was appointed for this &s;ervice, be|&s;ides the Briti&s;h forces of about 10000 Waldeckers and He&s;&s;ians. The whole force, provided all the parts had been united at fir&s;t, was &s;uppo&s;ed to have amount|ed to 35,000 men. Perhaps this might be only the calculation which was made upon paper, that gene|rally exceeds the true complement by a con&s;iderable degree. It is not likely that ever &s;uch a number at one time could be brought to action in any one place. It was however a formidable armament, and a larger army than ever had been &s;ent by any European pow|er to the continent of America. With an army inferi|or in number to this, Alexander the Great made him|&s;elf ma&s;ter of the whole Per&s;ian empire. The troops were &s;uppo&s;ed to be the be&s;t in the world, and under the command of as good officers as were in all Eu|rope They were well provided with all &s;orts of provi|&s;ions, warlike &s;tores, and ammunition, and be&s;ides &s;up|ported by a numerous fleet, well appointed and com|manded by the be&s;t officers. The General and Ad|miral, be&s;ides their military power, were inve&s;ted with authority as commi&s;&s;ioners by act of parliament, for re&s;toring peace to the colonies, and for granting par|don to &s;uch as &s;hould de&s;erve mercy. It may be ob|&s;erved here, that the ideas of mercy &s;uppo&s;ed in po|litical &s;tates &s;eldom an&s;wer the ends propo&s;ed by the offering of it, and this appeared evidently in the me|thod
<PB N="153" REF="156">now propo&s;ed of offering mercy to the coloni&s;ts. It was mercy which was to be merited by actions to be performed contrary to rea&s;onable conviction of error, and was no way calculated to gain the affections or reach the heart. Mercy never &s;uppo&s;es merit, but al|ways implies forgivene&s;s freely and graciou&s;ly be&s;tow|ed, from a &s;en&s;e of which all rebellious principles and errors of mind are overcome, and tho&s;e that are for|given obey and return to their duty, merely out of love. Had Lord and General Howe's mercy proceed|ed upon this principle, the American war had been ended long ago, and Great Britain would not have &s;marted under the rod of a civil war, nor groaned un|der &s;uch a load of taxes and national debt as &s;he does at pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>The &s;ituation of the army at Halifax, was far from being eligible; the country was barren, and not ca|pable of affording a &s;ufficient quantity of provi&s;ions, nor was the place even fit to afford a &s;ufficient quar|ter for the private men, who were obliged to continue aboard the &s;hips during the whole time they &s;tayed there.</P>
<P>While the General waited at Halifax for reinforce|ments from Britain, he grew impatient, being pre&s;&s;ed by the want of provi&s;ions, and other di&s;advantages.&mdash; He at la&s;t, without waiting for his brother Lord Howe, departed from Halifax, with Admiral Shuld|ham, about the 10th of June, and arrived at Sandy Hook about the end of the month. Sandy Hook is a point of land that lies at the entrance into that con|fluence of &s;ounds, roads, creeks, and bays, which are formed by New York, Staten, and Long I&s;lands, the continent on either &s;ide, with the North and Rariton Rivers. On their pa&s;&s;age they were joined by &s;ix
<PB N="154" REF="157">tran&s;ports with highland troops on board, who had been &s;eparated from &s;everal of their companions in their voyage. The&s;e that were mi&s;&s;ing, with about 450 &s;oldiers, and &s;everal officers, were taken by the American cruizers. and carried into Bo&s;ton. Gene|ral Howe found the places of acce&s;s to New York I&s;land, &s;trongly fortified, defended by a numerous ar|tillery; and guarded by a va&s;t number of troops little inferior to an army. This made the General alter his re&s;olution of making a de&s;cent on that part. Long I&s;land on account of its extent, did not admit of being &s;o &s;trongly guarded; it was however in a tolerable &s;tate of defence, and had con&s;iderable encampments on the end of the i&s;land next to New York, and &s;everal works thrown upon the mo&s;t acce&s;&s;ible parts of the coa&s;t, as well as at the &s;tronge&s;t internal pa&s;&s;es. Staten I&s;land being of le&s;s con&s;equence, was neglected, and not &s;o much attended to. This was certainly a great neglect in the provincials, who ought undoubtedly to have guarded again&s;t all po&s;&s;ible attempts of their enemies, and from what they had experienced in the defence of Sullivan I&s;land, ought to have remembered that a good re&s;i&s;tance at fir&s;t would have been ready to have damped the courage of the invaders, and have made them more timorous in their future attacks.</P>
<P>Upon the third of July, the General landed on the i&s;land, without oppo&s;ition, to the great joy of many of the inhabitants, who, being on the &s;ide of govern|ment, had &s;uffered greatly for their loyalty. The troops were cantoned in the villages where they receiv|ed plenty of fre&s;h provi&s;ions which they now much wanted, and regaled them&s;elves with the fruits of the i&s;land, and refre&s;hed their &s;pirits. General Howe was here met by Governor Tryon, with &s;everal other
<PB N="155" REF="158">well-affected to government who had taken refuge on board a &s;hip at Sandy Hook. The&s;e gave him an ac|count of the &s;trength of the provincials. He was al|&s;o joined by about &s;ixty gentlemen from New Jer&s;ey, who came to take up arms in the royal cau&s;e, and a|bout 200 militia of the i&s;land, which were embodied for the &s;ame purpo&s;e. This afforded a flattering pro&s;|pect to the General, that when the army was landed and collected in force to &s;upport the loyali&s;ts, &s;uch numbers would join it, as would contribute much to bring the war to a &s;peedy conclu&s;ion.</P>
<P>This was an idea that mi&s;led both the government at home, and the officers abroad, and ruined the &s;uc|ce&s;s of the greate&s;t part of their mea&s;ures: they judg|ed of the body of the coloni&s;ts from a few &s;amples which they had of creatures that were under the influ|ence of crown officers, and fal&s;ely concluded, that all the provinces would be of the &s;ame temper as &s;oon as they had an opportunity to di&s;cover their loyalty, but experience convinced them that they were mi&s;taken, though they continued to boa&s;t of the number of their friends and of the multitude of loyal coloni&s;ts that flocked to the royal &s;tandard.</P>
<P>Lord Howe arrived at Halifax about a fortnight af|ter the General's departure, from whence he proceed|ed to Staten I&s;land, where he arrived about the mid|dle of July. His fir&s;t act was to &s;end a flag a&s;hore, with a circular letter to the &s;everal late Governors of the colonies, acquainting them with his power civil and military, and de&s;ired that they would publi&s;h as generally as po&s;&s;ible, for the information of the peo|ple, a declaration with accompanied the letter. In this declaration the informed the public of the powers with which he and his brother were inve&s;ted, by virtue
<PB N="156" REF="159">of an act of parliament to grant general and particular pardons to all tho&s;e, who in the mid&s;t of the tumult and di&s;order of the times, might have deviated from their ju&s;t allegiance, and who were willing, by a &s;peedy return to their duty, to reap the benefits of the royal favour, and of declaring any province, county, town, port, di&s;trict, or place to be at the peace of his Maje&s;ty; in which the penal provi&s;ions of that law would cea&s;e in their favor. It al&s;o promi&s;ed that a due con&s;ideration &s;hould be had to the &s;ervices of all per&s;ons who contributed to re&s;toring the public tran|quility.</P>
<P>The&s;e papers were immediately forwarded by Ge|neral Wa&s;hington to the congre&s;s, and as &s;peedily pub|li&s;hed by them in all the new&s;paper$, with a preface and comment in form of a re&s;olution, &s;etting forth their opinion of the nature and tendency of that de|claration. They &s;aid that they had publi&s;hed it, that the people of the United States might be informed of what nature are the commi&s;&s;ioners, and what the terms, with the expectation of which the court of Britain had endeavoured to amu&s;e and di&s;arm them; and that the few who &s;till remained &s;u&s;pended by a hope found|ed either in the ju&s;tice or moderation of that court, might now at length be convinced, that the valour alone of their country is &s;ufficient to &s;ave their liberties. The comment, added to the declaration, took away all the influence and force that was in it, to produce the ef|fect that was intended by it. It an&s;wered one of the&s;e purpo&s;es which the government and the Admiral had in view. The Americans turned it into ridicule, and branded it with the epithets of in&s;idious and fool|i&s;h. At this time &s;everal flags were &s;ent on &s;hore by Lord Howe, accompanied with letters to George
<PB N="157" REF="160">Wa&s;hington, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> which that officer refu&s;ed to re|ceive, as not being addre&s;&s;ed with the title and in the form due to the rank which he held under the United States. The congre&s;s highly applauded the dignity of this conduct in a public re&s;olution pa&s;&s;ed for the purpo&s;e; by which they directed, that for the future none of their commanders &s;hould receive any letter or me&s;&s;age from the enemy, but &s;uch as &s;hould be di|rected to them in the character which they re&s;pec|tively &s;u&s;tained. At length Adjutant-general Pater|&s;on was &s;ent to New York by General Howe, with a letter to <HI>George Wa&s;hington, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR></HI> &amp;c. &amp;c. Wa&s;hing|ton received him with great politene&s;s, and the u&s;ual ceremony of blindfolding him in pa&s;&s;ing through the fortifications and di&s;pen&s;ed with in his favor. Pater|&s;on regretted, in the name of his principal, the diffi|culties which had ari&s;en with re&s;pect to addre&s;&s;ing the letters; declared their high e&s;teem for his per&s;on and character, and that they did not mean to derogate from the re&s;pect due to his rank; and it was hoped the <HI>etceteras</HI> implied every thing, and would remove the impediments of their corre&s;pondence. The Ge|neral replied, that a letter directed to any one in a public character, &s;hould have &s;ome de&s;cription or in|dication of it, otherwi&s;e it would appear a mere pri|vate letter; that it was true the <HI>etceteras</HI> implied eve|ry thing, but they al&s;o implied any thing; and that he &s;hould ab&s;olutely decline any letter that was direct|ed to him as a private per&s;on, when it related to his public &s;tation. A long conference en&s;ued on the &s;ubject of pri&s;oners, and the complaints that were made on both &s;ides, particularly by the congre&s;s, re|lative to the treatment they received. The Adjutant having ob&s;erved, that the commi&s;&s;ioners were armed
<PB N="158" REF="161">with great powers; that they would derive the great|e&s;t plea&s;ure from effecting an accomodation; and that he him&s;elf wi&s;hed to have that vi&s;it con&s;idered as mak|ing the fir&s;t advances towards that de&s;irable object.&mdash; He received for an&s;wer, among other things, that by what had appeared, their powers were only to grant pardons; that tho&s;e who had committed no offence, nor done any fault, wanted no pardon; and that they were only defending what they deemed their indi&s;put|able right. Pater&s;on was received by Wa&s;hington in great military &s;tate, and the utmo&s;t politene&s;s was ob|&s;erved on both &s;ides.</P>
<P>It was about this time, and previous to the arrival of the fleet and army at New York, that plots in fa|vour of the royal cau&s;e were di&s;covered in New York and Albany, which occa&s;ioned much trouble. Some few were executed, great numbers were confined, and many abandoned their hou&s;es, through the influence of their fears. The&s;e were pur&s;ued as outlaws and enemies to their country. The e&s;tates of the&s;e unfor|tunate people, again&s;t whom there were proofs, were &s;eized. In the mean time &s;ome new forms of govern|ment were e&s;tabli&s;hed in all tho&s;e colonies which judg|ed the former in&s;ufficient for their &s;ituation, and the others made the nece&s;&s;ary alterations to adopt old forms to their new &s;y&s;tem. The declaration of inde|pendency was al&s;o publi&s;hed in all the colonies, and every where received and accompanied with the great|e&s;t te&s;timonies of joy. This confidence and boldne&s;s in the mid&s;t of &s;o untried and dangerous a &s;truggle, and at the approach of &s;o formidable an inva&s;ion, made many conclude that the colonies were either very pre|&s;umptuous, knew of &s;ome internal &s;trength, or had cer|tainty of foreign a&s;&s;i&s;tance. This might have been a|larming
<PB N="159" REF="162">to Great Britain, had not her governors been infatuated with the ideas of dominion and arbitrary power, that they could neither perceive what was for their own honour, nor the intere&s;t of their &s;overeign.</P>
<P>It was a long time before all the troops de&s;tined for this &s;ervice arrived; the fir&s;t divi&s;ion of the He&s;&s;ians with a number of Briti&s;h which attended them, &s;ailed directly to Halifax, as Lord Howe had done, being &s;till ignorant of the General's departure from that place. By this means the month of Augu&s;t was con|&s;iderably advanced before they arrived at New York, and it was of cour&s;e longer before any expedition of importance could be undertaken by the commi&s;&s;ion|ers. They were joined in the mean time by Sir Peter Parker and General Clinton, who had returned with the &s;quadron and forces from South Corolina, as well as by &s;ome regiments from Florida and the We&s;t Indies. When all the forces, except the He&s;&s;ians which were expected were arrived, an attempt upon Long I&s;land was re&s;olved, as being mo&s;t practicable, and therefore better fitted for the fir&s;t e&s;&s;ay than New York, becau&s;e it afforded a greater &s;cope for di&s;play|ing of military &s;kill and experience with advantage: it al&s;o abounded with tho&s;e &s;upplies which &s;o great a body of men as were now a&s;&s;embled by &s;ea and land, demanded. Upon the 22d of Augu&s;t, the fleet hav|ing taken nece&s;&s;ary mea&s;ures for covering the de&s;cent, the army was landed without oppo&s;ition near Utrecht and Grave&s;end on the &s;outh we&s;t end of the i&s;land, and not far from the Narrows where it approaches neare&s;t to Staten I&s;land. At that time General Put|nam was encamped with a &s;trong force at Brookland and Brooklyn, at a few miles di&s;tance on the North Coa&s;t, where his works covered the breadth of a &s;mall
<PB N="160" REF="163">penin&s;ula, having the Ea&s;t River, which &s;eparat|ed him from New York, on his left&punc; a mar&s;h which extended to Gowan's cave on his right, with the Bay and Governor's I&s;land to his back. The armies were &s;eparated by a range of hills covered with wood, which inter&s;ect the country from ea&s;t to we&s;t, and are in that part called the Heights of Guana. The di|rect road to the enemy lay through a village called Flat Bu&s;h, where the hills commenced, and near which was one of the mo&s;t important pa&s;&s;es. As the army advanced, the north coa&s;t was to the left, the &s;outh to the right, and Flat Bu&s;h was nearly in the centre be|tween both. The i&s;land in that part is formed nar|row by Jamaica Bay in the right, but &s;oon turns wide. General Putnam had detached a good part of his army to occupy the woody hills and po&s;&s;ess the pa&s;|&s;es; and provided the commanders had been &s;kilful and vigilant, they could not have ea&s;ily pa&s;&s;ed. It ap|pears, however, that it was not the plan of the colo|ni&s;ts to attempt any de&s;perate experiment, till once they had exerci&s;ed their troops in &s;kirmi&s;hes, and taught them the po&s;&s;ibility of conque&s;t in their turn.&mdash; They knew that the Briti&s;h troops were brave, and longed for nothing more than an opportunity to &s;ig|nalize them&s;elves, and put an end to the war by a bold pu&s;h.&mdash;Their intere&s;t and &s;afety both de|pended much upon &s;peedy action. The coloni&s;ts were as yet raw troops, and wanted experience in war; a &s;udden attack and a &s;ignal overthrow would have di&s;pirited them, and fru&s;trated all their hopes of defending their country and gaining their liberty.&mdash; What was by our troops called cowardice, was in them the greate&s;t prudence, and true&s;t wi&s;dom.&mdash; They avoided indu&s;triou&s;ly coming to any general ac|tion,
<PB N="161" REF="164">becau&s;e it was not yet their intere&s;t to do it.&mdash; The wearying and harra&s;&s;ing our forces an&s;wered all the purpo&s;es of a general engagement, without &s;laughter and blood&s;hed to them&s;elves.</P>
<P>Lord Cornwallis, according to orders, marched on immediately with the re&s;erve to Flat Bu&s;h, where finding the provincials in po&s;&s;ession of the pa&s;s, he complied with his orders in making no attempt upon it. When the whole army was landed, the He&s;&s;ians under the command of General Hei&s;ter, compo&s;ed the centre at Flat Bu&s;h. Major-General Grant com|manded the left wing which extended to the coa&s;t; and the principal army containing the greate&s;t part of the Briti&s;h forces under the command of General Clinton, Earl Percy, and Lord Cornwallis, turned &s;hort to the right, and approached the oppo&s;ite coa&s;t at Flat Land. Had our Generals been going to at|tack the brave&s;t troops that ever &s;erved in Flanders or Germany, they could not have been more on their guard than when they were going to attack men they had determined to be cowards and pol|troons.</P>
<P>When every thing was prepared for forcing the hills, and advancing towards the lines of the provin|cials, General Clinton at the head of the van of the army, con&s;i&s;ting of the light infantry, light hor&s;e, and grenadiers under Lord Cornwallis, with the fourteen field pieces, began in the evening of the 26th as &s;oon as it was dark, to march from Flat Land, and having pa&s;&s;ed through the part of the country called the New Lots, they arrived upon the road that cro&s;&s;es the hills from Bedford to Jamaica, where turning to the left towards the former of the&s;e places, they &s;eized a con|&s;iderable pa&s;s which the Americans had through &s;ome
<PB N="162" REF="165">unaccountable neglect left unguarded. The main body under Lord Percy, with ten field pieces, fol|lowed at a moderate di&s;tance, and the way being thus &s;ucce&s;sfully opened, the whole army pa&s;&s;ed the hills without noi&s;e or impediment, and de&s;cended by the town of Bedford into the lower country, which lay between them and Putnam's lines. The engagement was begun early in the morning by the He&s;&s;ians, at Flat Bu&s;h, and by General Grant along the coa&s;t, and a warm canonade, with a &s;harp fire of &s;mall arms, was eagerly &s;upported on both &s;ides for &s;ome hours. During this time the King's troops gained no advan|tage, but were upon the point of being repul&s;ed, had not the &s;hips in the mean time made &s;everal motions to the left, and attacked a battery on Red Hook, both to di&s;tract the right of the coloni&s;ts who were engag|ed with General Grant, and to call off their attention totally from the left and rear, where their greate&s;t danger lay. Tho&s;e who were engaged with the He&s;&s;ians were the fir&s;t who perceived the march of the Bri|ti&s;h army, and the danger they them&s;elves were in;&mdash; they accordingly retreated in large bodies, and in good order, with their artillery, with a de&s;ign to recover their camp. They were however attacked furiou&s;ly by the King's troops, and driven back into the woods, where they were met by the He&s;&s;ians and alternately intercepted and cha&s;ed by the dragoons and light in|fantry. In the&s;e critical and de&s;perate circum&s;tances, &s;ome of their regiments, though overpowered by num|bers, forced their way to the lines, through all the difficulties and and dangers that oppo&s;ed and &s;urround|ed them. Others, not le&s;s brave, peri&s;hed in the at|tempt. Some kept the woods and e&s;caped, while o|thers, le&s;s fortunate, were lo&s;t under the &s;ame protec|tion.
<PB N="163" REF="166">The nature of the country, and the variety of &s;ituation, occa&s;ioned a repetition and continuance of &s;mall engagements, pur&s;uits and &s;laughter, which la&s;ted for many hours.</P>
<P>Had the &s;kill and attention of the American Gene|rals on this occa&s;ion been equal to the bravery of their troops, the Briti&s;h Generals would have repented their landing upon Long I&s;land; but Putnam &s;uffered him|&s;elf to be &s;o effectually entrapped, that the bravery of his forces were rendered ineffectual, through the want of capacity in their commander. The right wing of the provincials, which was engaged with General Grant on the coa&s;t, were &s;o late in knowing what was carrying on in other parts, that they were intercepted in their retreat by &s;ome of the Briti&s;h troops, who in the morning had not only turned round the hill upon their left, but had traver&s;ed the whole extent of the country in their rear. Such of them as did not flee to the woods, which were the greater number, were obliged to throw them&s;elves into the mar&s;h at Cow|an's Cave, where many were drowned, and others peri&s;hed in the mud. A con&s;iderable number, how|ever, made their e&s;cape this way to the lines, though they were much thinned by the fire of the pur&s;uers.</P>
<P>The lo&s;s of the Americans on this occa&s;ion was ve|ry con&s;iderable, but not &s;o great as our accounts re|pre&s;ented it; it was &s;aid that they lo&s;t 3,000 men in|cluding about 1000 pri&s;oners. Almo&s;t a whole regi|ment from Maryland, con&s;i&s;ting altogether of young men of the be&s;t families, was &s;aid to have been totally cut off; but it was found afterwards, that many of the&s;e had e&s;caped among the re&s;t. Their own accounts do not acknowledge any &s;uch numbers &s;lain as our people affirmed; tho' it was confe&s;&s;ed that they lo&s;t a
<PB N="164" REF="167">number of their be&s;t and brave&s;t troops. But what was wor&s;t on their &s;ide, this defeat da&s;hed their hopes of &s;ucce&s;s, and damped their &s;pirits. New &s;ol|diers full of &s;pirits and pride of bodily &s;trength, can &s;carcely conceive any advantage over them, which the old can derive from di&s;cipline, and a knowledge of their bu&s;ine&s;s. And if they are commanded, and &s;kil|fully led to action in this temper, &s;o that tho&s;e who oppo&s;e them are deprived of an opportunity of turning the&s;e advantages to account, they will do won|derful execution; for as they are not capable of per|fectly under&s;tanding danger, and are not acquainted by experience of the pain and vexation of wounds, they are often more daring and adventurous than old &s;oldiers. But when they find courage and &s;trength totally u&s;ele&s;s, and when they are making the greate&s;t, and, as they imagine; the mo&s;t effectual efforts, and that they are &s;urrounded, overpowered, and de&s;troy|ed, by means that they cannot under&s;tand, they with|draw all due confidence from tho&s;e things on which they had before placed too much, and a&s;cribe an irre|&s;i&s;table power to military &s;kill and di&s;cipline, which they do not really po&s;&s;e&s;s. From the&s;e con&s;iderations they abandon their natural &s;trength, and it is gene|rally a long time before they dare tru&s;t their new knowledge and &s;kill &s;o far as to bring it effectually to action.</P>
<P>The commanders of the provincial troops commit|ted unpardonable errors on this occa&s;ion; they &s;carce|ly di&s;covered as much prudence and di&s;cernment as the meane&s;t country pea&s;ant would have done, had he been placed at the head of their army: they had tak|en no care to watch the motions of their enemy, nor to guard tho&s;e pa&s;&s;es that might have been ea&s;ily de|fended
<PB N="165" REF="168">again&s;t even a &s;uperior force, and would have prevented them from being &s;urrounded.&mdash;They ought to have had &s;couts and watches placed in all parts of the i&s;land, and to have &s;ecured every po&s;t that was in the &s;malle&s;t degree tenable. They ought to have had parties concealed behind every hedge, wall, or ditch, to have fired by &s;urpri&s;e upon every advanced party of their foes, which might have retreated to the main body when &s;ore pre&s;&s;ed, and given the alarm in due time. They might, as they knew the country had flanking parties of &s;wift troops, who might have thin|ned their enemies by occa&s;ional attacks, and fled to redoubts and thickets, and marched another way and made a fre&s;h attack on another quarter. They ought to have neglected no po&s;&s;ible methods of defence that could have been devi&s;ed in &s;uch a trying and critical &s;ituation. The apologies of the American Generals are childi&s;h and trifling. They repre&s;ented that they had no idea of &s;o many troops being landed on the i&s;land; but they ought to have been acquainted with every circum&s;tance, and watched every motion of the enemy. General Howe &s;hewed a great mea&s;ure of &s;kill and conduct in his military arrangement, and the whole attack was conducted with much prudence and &s;agacity; the men al&s;o &s;hewed much valour and in|trepedity, and as &s;oldiers behaved well. Their ardor was &s;o great, that the Generals could with dif|ficulty prevent them from attacking the American lines, in their keenne&s;s in pur&s;uing the fugitives. And it was imagined by &s;ome &s;anguine people that they would have carried all before them; but in &s;uch ca&s;es it is not ea&s;y for partizans to keep moderation in their conjectures. It is highly probable, that there was an emulation between the Briti&s;h and He&s;&s;ian
<PB N="166" REF="169">troops, to di&s;tingui&s;h them&s;elves in this engagement, which made both parties the more eager to do &s;ome|thing that might be taken notice of. Three of the enemy's commanders were taken pri&s;oners, viz. Ma|jor-General Sullivan, and the Brigadier General Lord Stirling, and Udell, and ten other field officers. The lo&s;s on the &s;ide of the Briti&s;h and He&s;&s;ian troops was &s;aid to be very incon&s;iderable, being under 350 killed and wounded, of which the former did not make a fifth part. The provincial accounts rate our lo&s;s much higher, and it is rea&s;onable to &s;uppo&s;e that our gazettes indu&s;triou&s;ly concealed part of our lo&s;s at home, as many who were pre&s;ent in the action affirm|ed that the lo&s;s of the Briti&s;h forces was much more con&s;iderable. Our army encamped on the front of the enemy's lines, and on the 28th of Augu&s;t broke ground in form at 600 yards di&s;tance, from a redoubt, which covered their enemy's left.</P>
<P>It was a lo&s;s to the Americans, that General Wa&s;h|ington at this time did not command them, nor does it appear that the plan of operation was of his devi&s;|ing. He during the time of the engagement pa&s;&s;ed over from New York to Long I&s;land, and is &s;aid to have bur&s;t out in a bitter exclamation of grief, when he perceived the ineveitable ruin of &s;ome of his be&s;t troops. Nothing was now left but to u&s;e the be&s;t means to pre&s;erve the remainder of the army upon Long I&s;land. He knew that the &s;uperior power of the royal artillery would &s;oon &s;ilence their batteries, and that if the lines were forced in their pre&s;ent &s;itua|tion, con&s;idering the &s;uperiority of the King's troops in number, and the pre&s;ent dejectment of the provin|cial troops, there was little hope of pre&s;erving them from being either killed or taken. If he &s;hould rein|force
<PB N="167" REF="170">them he would hazard the lo&s;s of New York, which was already threatened on all &s;ides, and kept in continual alarm by the fleet.&mdash;Another danger that threatened, which was eqally to be avoided, the war &s;hips only waited for a fair wind, to enter and take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Ea&s;t River, which would have totally cut off all communication between the i&s;lands. In this &s;ituation there was no hope left, except in a re|treat, which was even exceedingly difficult under the watchful eye of an active enemy, with a powerful army flu&s;hed with &s;ucce&s;s, almo&s;t clo&s;e to their works.&mdash; This difficult ta&s;k was however undertaken and exe|cuted, with great addre&s;s and abilities, by General Wa&s;hington. On the 29th in the night, their troops were withdrawn from the camp and their different works, and with their baggage, &s;tores, and almo&s;t all their artillery, were conveyed to the water &s;ide, em|barked, and pa&s;&s;ed over the Ferry to New York, with wonderful &s;ilence and order, that our army tho' within 600 yards, did not perceive the lea&s;t motion, and were &s;urpri&s;ed in the morning of finding the lines abandoned, and &s;eeing their rear guard in their boats and out of danger. Tho&s;e that are acquainted with the u&s;ual noi&s;e and confu&s;ion which attend decamp|ing, &s;o many thou&s;ands of men, even in open day, will be obliged to acknowledge that this retreat required an extraordinary addre&s;s to conduct it, and mu&s;t be al|lowed a ma&s;ter-piece in its kind in the art of war. It &s;hewed plainly, that General Wa&s;hington knew how to profit by the mi&s;carriage of others, and had the ca|pacity to turn his misfortune to his own honour. Af|ter the retreat from Long I&s;land, General Sullivan was &s;ent upon parole, with a me&s;&s;age from Lord Howe to the Congre&s;s. In this he &s;tated, that tho' he could
<PB N="168" REF="171">not treat with them in the character of a con|gre&s;s, he was very glad of having a conference with &s;ome of their members, whom he would con&s;ider only as private gentlemen, and would him&s;elf meet them at &s;uch place as they &s;hould appoint. He &s;aid that he had, together with the General, full powers to compromi&s;e di&s;putes between Great Britain and America, upon terms advantageous to both, for ob|taining which he had been detained near two months, and his arrival had been on that account pre|vented, before the declaration of independency took place. He wi&s;hed that a compact might be &s;ettled at this time before any deci&s;ive blow was &s;truck, and neither party could &s;ay that they were compelled to enter into the agreement.</P>
<P>That if the Congre&s;s had a mind to treat, many things which they had not yet a&s;ked, might and ought to be granted to them; and if upon the conference any probable ground of accomodation appeared, the authority of congre&s;s mu&s;t afterwards be acknow|ledged, or the compact could not be complete.</P>
<P>The an&s;wer of the congre&s;s was, that being the re|pre&s;entatives of the free and independent States of America, they could not with propriety &s;end any of their members in their private characters; but that ever de&s;irous of e&s;tabli&s;hing peace upon rea&s;onable terms they would appoint a committee to know whether he had any authority to treat with per&s;ons authorized by congre&s;s for that purpo&s;e in behalf of America, and what that authority was, and to haer &s;uch prepo&s;itions as he &s;hould think fit to make re&s;pecting the &s;ame.&mdash; Dr Franklin, Mr Adams, and Mr Rutlege was ap|pointed as a committee upon this occa&s;ion, and ac|cordingly waited upon Lord Howe, in Staten I&s;land.
<PB N="169" REF="172">The committee &s;ummed up the account of this con|ference, which they laid before the congre&s;s, in the following terms. "Upon the whole it did not ap|pear to your committee, that his Lord&s;hip's commi&s;|&s;ion contained any other authority than what is con|tained in the act of parliament; viz. that of granting pardons, with &s;uch exceptions, as the commi&s;&s;ioners &s;hall think proper to make, and of declaring Ameri|ca, or any part of it, to be in the King's peace upon &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion. For as to the power of enquiring into the &s;tate of America, which his Lord&s;hip mentioned to us, and of conferring and con&s;ulting with any per&s;ons the commi&s;&s;ioners might think proper, and repre&s;ent the re&s;ult of &s;uch conver&s;ations to the mini&s;try, who (provided the colonies &s;hould &s;ubject them&s;elves) might after all, or might not, at their plea&s;ure, make any alterations in the former in&s;tructions to governors, or propo&s;e in parliament any amendment of the acts complained of, we apprehend any expectation from the effect of &s;uch a power would have been too un|certain and precarious to be relied on by America, had &s;he &s;till continued in her &s;tate of dependence.</P>
<P>In this manner the hopes of negociation ended be|tween the commi&s;&s;ioners and the congre&s;s. The mi|ni&s;terial demogogues at home called loudly out a|gain&s;t the colonies for not accepting of Lord Howe's and the General's propo&s;als; they now devoted all the thirteen united colonies to de&s;truction, and con&s;idered it as a mo&s;t righteous, as well as mo&s;t ne|ce&s;&s;ary proceeding, to wa&s;te them by fire and &s;word. The right of Great Britain to do with America as &s;he plea&s;ed, and to a&s;&s;e&s;s the people by acts of parlia|ment, without her con&s;ent, was always taken for granted as a fir&s;t principle; while both the truth of
<PB N="170" REF="173">the principle, and its utility were denied by the Unit|ed Colonies. They con&s;idered the lodging of &s;uch a power in the hands of men, who&s;e intere&s;t it was to burden them, to ea&s;e them&s;elves by oppre&s;&s;ing them was neither ju&s;t nor rea&s;onable, and contrary to all found policy. It was &s;aid that when the Romans &s;ent out colonies they made them always as free as tho&s;e at home, and never attempted to tax them more than other citizens; that they were always Romans, however far from Italy, had the &s;ame laws, immuni|ties, and privileges, that all other citizens po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, and that when Governors or Prefects attempted to op|pre&s;s any province, they were &s;everely puni&s;hed by the &s;enate; and that any Roman citizen in any part of the empire, who had proper qualifications like others, might become a &s;enator, as well as tho&s;e within Italy. But this was not the ca&s;e of the Briti&s;h coloni&s;ts, who were not admitted to any &s;hare in the &s;enatorial au|thority, except in a nominal &s;en&s;e, which was of no importance, without the sanction of a &s;uperior power. It was added, that the Romans behaved with much more re&s;pect to conquered nations than we did to na|tural &s;ubjects and born citizens; for provided the nations whom the Romans &s;ubdued inclined to become Romans, they were ruled by the &s;ame laws, and ob|tained the &s;ame privileges; and were &s;upported and defended by the laws of the empire, as if they had al|ways belonged to it.</P>
<P>The Briti&s;h commi&s;&s;ioners having a double author|ity, when their hopes of negociation failed, they were determined to pu&s;h their military power with more vigour. It would appear that men when they act in the character of &s;oldiers con&s;ider moral obligation to be different from what it is when they act in other
<PB N="171" REF="174">characters. The two commanders in chief had in the &s;enate condemned the laws made again&s;t the Ameri|cans, but now they they are employed to execute them at the expence of blood, and the danger of their own lives. The policy of nations and the ideas of per&s;ons in high life concerning ju&s;tice and equity, are very often contrary to the fundamental maxims of morality, which men would de&s;ire to have practi&s;ed when applied to them&s;elves.</P>
<P>The royal army was now divided from the i&s;land of New York by the ea&s;t river, and the men were im|patient to pa&s;s that narrow limit. They po&s;ted them|&s;elves along the coa&s;t wherever they could &s;ee or front their enemies, and erected batteries to an&s;wer, if not &s;ilence theirs. A fleet con&s;i&s;ting of upwards of 300 &s;ail including tran&s;ports, covered the face of the wa|ters, while the &s;hips of war hovering round the i&s;land threatened de&s;truction to every part, and were conti|nually engaged with one or other of the batteries, by which it was &s;urrounded. The &s;mall i&s;lands between the oppo&s;ite &s;hore were perpetual objects of conte&s;t, until by the force of a well &s;erved artillery, the aid of the &s;hips and the intrepedity of the troops, they &s;ecured tho&s;e that were mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary for their fu|ture operations.</P>
<P>Thus an almo&s;t con&s;tant cannonade was kept up for many days, and the troops who had &s;o lately e&s;caped from imminent danger, had little time to quiet their ap|prehen&s;ions. At length all things being prepared for a de&s;cent, &s;everal motions were made by the &s;hips in the North River, with a de&s;ign to draw the attention of the provincials to that &s;ide of the i&s;land. Other parts were al&s;o threatened. to encrea&s;e the uncertain|ty of the real object of attack. The &s;eizing of the
<PB N="172" REF="175">i&s;land of Montre&s;or near Hellgate, and erecting a battery on it to &s;ilence one which the provincials had at Floren's Nook, had the appearance of landing in that part, which was near the centre of New York i&s;land. Whil&s;t the coloni&s;ts were in this &s;tate of &s;u&s;|pence and expectation, the fir&s;t divi&s;ion of the army un|der the command of Gen. Clinton, with Earl Cornwal|lis, Major-General Vaughan, Brigadier-General Le&s;lie, and the He&s;&s;ian Colonel Dunop, embarked at the head of Newton Bay, which runs deep into Long-I&s;land, and where they were out of all view of the enemy. Covered by five &s;hips of war upon their en|trance into the river, they proceeded to Kep's bay about three miles north of New York, where being le&s;s expected than in &s;ome other places, the prepara|tion for defence was not &s;o great. The works were notwith&s;tanding tolerably &s;trong and &s;upported with men, but the fire from the &s;hips was &s;o &s;evere and well directed, that the works were de&s;erted, and the army landed without oppo&s;ition.</P>
<P>The provincials, who dreaded the fury of the men of war, abandoned New York, with their other po&s;ts on that part of the i&s;land, and retired to the North end, where their principal &s;trength lay. They were obliged to leave a great part of their artillery and mi|litary &s;tores, which were con&s;iderable, behind. They had &s;ome men &s;lain and a few taken pri&s;oners in the retreat and &s;kirmi&s;hes which happened during their &s;tay.&mdash;The King's troops &s;uffered con&s;iderably, but this lo&s;s was conealed as much as po&s;&s;ible,&mdash; and was never made public by government accounts. Many of the American regiments behaved badly on this occa&s;ion. Their late &s;evere lo&s;&s;es on Long I&s;land appeared vi&s;ible in their behaviour at this time. A
<PB N="173" REF="176">part of the Briti&s;h army took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of New York and the re&s;t encamped near the centre of the i&s;land, with their right on Floren's Nook, on the Ea&s;t River, and the left near Bloomingdale, and thus occupied the i&s;land from &s;hore to &s;hore, which, though it is about &s;ixteeen miles in length, is not above one in breadth. It appeared from the beginning, that the provincials did not account the i&s;land and city of New York worth ri&s;king a general engagement, nor was it their plan in general to venture much at one time, but to exerci&s;e their troops in con&s;tant &s;kirmi&s;hes, and wa&s;te the Briti&s;h forces by degrees. General Wa&s;hington took po&s;t at King&s;bridge, by which he had a commu|nication with the continent of New York, and where he erected &s;trong works on both &s;ides of the pa&s;&s;age, which &s;eemed to defy a &s;trong force. Their neare&s;t encampment was on the heights of Harleim, at the di&s;tance of about a mile and an half. There was be|tween them M'Gowan's pa&s;s, and the &s;trong grounds called Morrris's Heights lay between and King&s;bridge, which were defen&s;ible again&s;t a very &s;uperior force. In this &s;ituation of the armies, &s;kirmi&s;hes frequently happened, and it was found that by degrees the late apprehen&s;ions of the provincials began to wear away. This was the great object which General Wa&s;hington had in view; he knew that when his men once began to perceive that they could fight without being killed, and could occa&s;ionally beat those who had defeated them, they would, in proce&s;s of time, become fitter for greater attempts, and conquer in their turn.</P>
<P>General Howe had not been many days in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of New York, when that city was &s;et on fire by &s;ome that had &s;tayed behind, and concealed them&s;elves for that purpo&s;e, being determined, if po&s;&s;ible, to pre|vent
<PB N="174" REF="177">its being of any benefit to the conquerer. They had prepared combu&s;tibles with great art and ingenu|ity, and took the opportunity of dry weather and a bri&s;k wind to &s;et fire to the city about midnight in se|veral places at the &s;ame time. Thus near a third part of that beautful city was reduced to a&s;hes, and unle&s;s the activity of the troops, as well as of the &s;ailors, had pre&s;erved the remainder, it had all been con&s;umed. Some of tho&s;e who were thought to have been con|cerned in kindling the flames were thrown into the mid&s;t of them by the &s;oldiers, and burnt to death;&mdash; though it could never yet be a&s;certained who were the real authors of this conflagration nor were the &s;oldiers certain that tho&s;e whom they threw into the flames had any hand in kindling of them. Tho&s;e that know how little &s;oldiers are given to enquire into the truth of a cau&s;e of this &s;ort, will not wonder much at their burning the innocent as readily as the guilty.</P>
<P>General Howe, finding that no attempt could be made with &s;ucce&s;s upon the &s;ide of New York, but that any attempt of that kind would be attended with the greate&s;t danger, determined upon a new plan of operation, which would oblige the provincials either to quit their &s;ituation, or render their holding it ex|tremely dangerous. For this purpo&s;e, on the 11th of October the greater part of the army embarked in flat boats and other &s;mall ve&s;&s;els proper for the &s;ervice, and pa&s;&s;ed &s;ucce&s;sfully through the dangerous naviga|tion of Hellgate, which forms a communication be|tween the Ea&s;t River and the Sound, and landed on Frog&s;neck near the town of Ea&s;t Che&s;ter, which lies on the continent belonging to New York, on the &s;ide of Connecticut.&mdash;Earl Percy, with two Brigades of Briti&s;h troops and one of He&s;&s;ians, continued in the
<PB N="175" REF="178">lines near Haerlem, to cover New York. Had Ge|neral Wa&s;hington commanded old troops, which he could have depended upon, General Howe might have paid dear for this adventure. Had Wa&s;hington attacked Percy in the mean time of the embarkation, all the forces under the Earl might have been cut off, without the re&s;t being able to afford them the &s;malle&s;t aid or a&s;&s;i&s;tance. There was only one thing which could have pre&s;erved them, namely the fleet, which &s;urrounded the i&s;land, which could have afford|ed them protection almo&s;t in any &s;ituation into which they could have been reduced. This fleet was of va&s;t &s;ervice in all the operations of the army, and indeed it does not appear that our troops could have done a|ny thing unle&s;s they had been protected by the fleet. In this the provincials were chiefly inferior, being to-totally de&s;titute of any force of this nature. The ar|my was obliged to halt for &s;ome days at Frog's Neck, to wait for the arrival of provi&s;ions and &s;tores, and for a reinforcement that was drawn from Staten I&s;land. When the&s;e arrived they marched through Pelham manor to New Roche&s;ter, which lies on the coa&s;t of the &s;ound, which is the name of that channel, which &s;eparates Long I&s;land from the continent.&mdash; Here they were joined by the greate&s;t part of a regi|ment of light hor&s;e from Ireland, the re&s;t of the troops had been taken in their pa&s;&s;age by the American crui|zers upon the coa&s;t. They were al&s;o joined by the &s;econd divi&s;ion of He&s;&s;ians, under General Knyphausen, with a regiment of Waldeckers, both of which had arrived at New Yorrk &s;ince the army had depart|ed from it. The chief object of this expedition was to cut off the communication between Wa&s;hington and the ea&s;tern colonies: and if this mea&s;ure did not
<PB N="176" REF="179">bring him to an engagement, to enclo&s;e him on all &s;ides in this fa&s;tne&s;&s;es on the North end of York I&s;land. The King's troops were now ma&s;ters of the lower road to Connecticut and Bo&s;ton, but to gain the upper it was nece&s;&s;ary to advance to the higher grounds called the White Plains. This is a rugged, &s;toney, and mountainous tract of ground, and is on|ly part of an a&s;cent to a country that is &s;till higher, rougher, and of more difficult acce&s;s. When the ar|my advanced to the higher grounds it was judged ne|ce&s;&s;ary to leave the &s;econd divi&s;ion of He&s;&s;ians with the regiment of Waldeck, at New Rochelle, to keep a communication between the &s;upplies of provi|&s;ions and nece&s;&s;aries that were to arrive at that port. The army was now truly &s;o powerful, that it was en|abled to &s;upport every &s;ervice.</P>
<P>General Howe &s;oon began to find that he had now another game to play than what he had upon Long I&s;land.&mdash;Wa&s;hington fore&s;aw the intention of this &s;cheme, and provided again&s;t its effects. He perceiv|ed the danger he would be in, if the Briti&s;h General &s;ucceeded in his &s;cheme; that he would be compel|led to commit the whole fortune of the war, and the &s;afety of all the colonies to the hazard of a general en|gagement. In his pre&s;ent &s;tate this would have been highly imprudent; his troops were not well recover|ed from the terror of their late misfortunes, and in ca&s;e he &s;hould have been defeated, there could &s;carcely be a po&s;&s;ibility of a retreat. His army is &s;aid at this time to have been much reduced by &s;ickne&s;s, which the &s;everity of the &s;ervice, indifferent quarters, bad cloathing, the want of &s;alt and other nece&s;&s;aries, join|ed to a &s;lovenline&s;s that naturally prevailed in New England and the northern colonies, had rendered ge|neral,
<PB N="177" REF="180">and very fatal to their army. A grand move|ment was accordingly made by the whole, in a line of &s;mall detachments, and entrenched camps, which oc|cupied every height and &s;trong guard from Valentine's Hill near King's Bridge on the right, to White Plains and the upper road to Connecticut on the left. In this &s;ituation they found the whole line of the King's troops as they marched at a moderate di&s;tance. The deep river Brunx covered their rear, whil&s;t the open ground to the la&s;t afforded a &s;ecure pa&s;&s;age for their &s;tores and baggage for the upper country. A garri|&s;on was left to defend Fort Wa&s;hington, the lines of Haerlem, and King&s;bridge.</P>
<P>General Howe in this &s;ituation of the enemy thought it nece&s;&s;ary to proceed with caution and great circum&s;pection. The progre&s;s of the army was &s;low, the march clo&s;e, the encampments compact, and well guarded with artillery, and the whole was conducted in the mo&s;t regular, and warlike manner. In &s;pite of all the caution of the General, the provincials convey|ed parties over the Brunx to interrupt their march, which occa&s;ioned many &s;kirmi&s;hes in which the King's forces were conquerors. But it had this effect upon the coloni&s;ts, that it gradually inured them to hard|&s;hips, and rendered war familiar to them. When the King's troops approached White Plains, their ene|mies quitted their detached camps along the Brunx, and joining their left, took a &s;trong ground of encamp|ment before the Briti&s;h on the former. When all things were prepared, and ready for action, the army marched early in the morning in two columns towards White Plains, with their left wing commanded by General Hei&s;ter. Before mid-day, all the enemy's ad|vanced parties retired back within their works, be|fore
<PB N="178" REF="181">the light infantry and the He&s;&s;ian Cha&s;&s;eurs. The army formed with the right upon the road, from Mam|aroneck, about a mile di&s;tant from their centre, and the left to the Brunx, near about the &s;ame di&s;tance from the right flank of their entrenchments. The A|mericans had a party lodged in an advantageous po&s;t that was &s;eparated from their right flank by the Brunx, and which al&s;o by its windings covered that corps in front from the left of the Briti&s;h army. As this po&s;t would have been of great con&s;equence, in at|tacking that flank of the entrenchment, Brigadier-General Le&s;lie, with the &s;everal Brigades of Briti&s;h troops, the He&s;&s;ian grenadiers under Colonel Do|nop, and a battalion of that corps were ordered to di&s;|lodge the enemy. Previous to the attack, Colonel Rall, who commanded a brigade of He&s;&s;ians on the left, had pa&s;&s;ed the Brunx, and gained a po&s;t, which enabled him to annoy the enemy's flank, while they were engaged with the other forces in the front.</P>
<P>The pa&s;&s;age of the river was difficult, but the troops performed it with readine&s;s and alacrity, and the 28th and 35th regiments having pa&s;&s;ed fir&s;t, form|ed with great &s;teadine&s;s on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide under the fire of their enemies. On this occa&s;ion the public ac|counts &s;ay nothing of the lo&s;s of our troops, but &s;uch as were upon the &s;pot have declared that our men &s;uffered &s;everely, and that the troops were greatly thinned by the fire of the enemy. They, however, a&s;cended a &s;teep hill, in defiance of all oppo&s;ition, and ru&s;hing upon the enemy, drove them from their works. The re&s;t of the troops &s;hewed no le&s;s fortitude and &s;teadine&s;s in &s;upporting the&s;e two regiments. The gaining of this important po&s;t took up a con&s;iderable time, which was prolonged by the enemy's &s;till &s;up|porting
<PB N="179" REF="182">a &s;cattered engagement, under defence of the adjoining walls and hedges. In the evening the He&s;&s;ian grenadiers were ordered forward within cannon &s;hot of the entrenchments, the 2d brigade of the Briti&s;h formed in the rear, and the two He&s;&s;ian brigades on the left of the &s;econd. The right and centre of the army did not remove from the ground upon which they were formed. In that po&s;ition the whole army lay upon their arms during the night with a full intention and in the fulle&s;t expectation to en|gage in the morning, and to attack the provincial camp.&mdash;General Wa&s;hington, with great addre&s;s before the morning had mea&s;ured out more work for the Briti&s;h forces. He had drawn back this encamp|ment in the night, and greatly &s;trengthened his lines by additional works. For this rea&s;on the attack was deferred, and it was thought nece&s;&s;ary to wait for the arrival of the fourth brigade, and of two battalions of the &s;ixth, which had been left with Earl Percy at New York. Upon the arrival of the&s;e troops, the nece&s;&s;ary di&s;po&s;itions were made in the evening for attacking the enemy on the la&s;t day of October, but a very wet night and morning prevented the de&s;ign from being executed as was intended.</P>
<P>General Wa&s;hington, who knew the intention of our General, had not the &s;malle&s;t intention ventur|ing an engagement, while it was po&s;&s;ible to avoid it. He knew that delay was in &s;ome re&s;pects a victory to him, and that &s;mall &s;kirmi&s;hes, that could not in the lea&s;t affect the public &s;afety, would train his men to war and innure them to danger, better than a general engagement, which in one day might decide their own and the fate of their country.</P>
<P>The enemies of Wa&s;hington confe&s;&s;ed, that in the
<PB N="180" REF="183">cour&s;e of this campaign, and more particularly in this part of it, he fully performed the part of a great commander.</P>
<P>It was &s;aid by the Americans, that upon our men covering four or five batteries with a powerful artil|lery preparatory to an attack, together with the ge|neral's knowledge, that by turning his camp the Bri|ti&s;h forces might become po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of hills at his back which totally commanded it, he found it nece&s;&s;ary to change his &s;ituation. He accordingly quitted his camp in the night of the fir&s;t of November, and took high|er grounds towards the North Ca&s;tle di&s;trict, after having &s;et fire to the town or village of White Plains, as well as to all the hou&s;es and forage near the lines. The Kings troops next day took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their entrenchments. General Howe, finding that all his art could not draw Wa&s;hington to an engagement, and that the nature of the country and his pre&s;ent &s;i|tuation did not admit of his being forced to one, de|termined not to &s;pend his time in fruitle&s;s manoeuvres, without performing any thing of con&s;equence. He therefore re&s;olved to take this opportunity to drive the provincials out of York I&s;land, which their army could not prevent. For this purpo&s;e General Knyp|hau&s;en cro&s;&s;ed the country from New Rochelle, and having taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of King&s;bridge without oppo&s;i|tion, entered York I&s;land, and took his &s;tation to the North of Fort Wa&s;hington, to which the enemy had retired at his approach. Fort Wa&s;hington lay on the we&s;t &s;ide of New York I&s;land, near to King&s;bbridge Bow, and Jeffery's Nook, and almo&s;t facing Fort Lee in the Jer&s;ey &s;ide, from which it was &s;eparated by the North River. This was a &s;trong work, but not &s;uffi|cient to re&s;i&s;t heavy artillery, and it was by no means
<PB N="181" REF="184">of a &s;ufficient extent for any other purpo&s;e, except &s;trengthening the lines. But the &s;ituation was ex|ceedingly &s;trong and the approaches difficult.</P>
<P>Upon the 13th of November the army returned &s;lowly by the North River, and encamped on the heights of Fordham, at a moderate di&s;tance from King&s;bridge, with the North River on the right, and the Brunx on the left. Every thing being prepared for attacking the fort, a &s;ummons was &s;ent to Co|lonel M'Gaw, who commanded it, to &s;urrender, who declaring that he was determined to defend it to the la&s;t extremity, a general a&s;&s;ault was re&s;olved upon, to &s;ave the time that would be lo&s;t in making regular approaches. The garri&s;on con&s;i&s;ted of near 3000 men, and the &s;trong guards near the fort were co|vered with lines and works. Four attacks were made at the &s;ame time. The fir&s;t on the north fide, com|manded by General Knyphau&s;en, at the head of two columns of He&s;&s;ians and Waldeckers. The &s;econd on the ea&s;t was led on by Brigadier-General Mat|thew, at the head of the fir&s;t and &s;econd battalion of light infantry, and two battalion of guards, &s;upport|ed by Lord Cornwallis, with the fir&s;t and &s;econd bat|talions of grenadiers, and the 33d regiment. The&s;e troops cro&s;&s;ed the Ea&s;t River in flat boats, and as the enemies works there extended the breadth of the i&s;land, redoubts and batteries were erected on the op|po&s;ite &s;hore, both to cover the landing of the troops and to annoy tho&s;e works which were near the water. The third attack, which was principally intended as a feint to di&s;tract the provincials, was conducted by Lieutenant-Colonel Sterling, with the forty &s;econd regiment, who pa&s;&s;ed the Ea&s;t River lower down, be|tween the &s;econd and fourth attacks. The la&s;t at|tack
<PB N="182" REF="185">was made by Lord Percy, with the party that he commanded on the &s;outh part of the i&s;land. All the attacks were &s;upported by a numerous, powerful, and well &s;erved artillery. The He&s;&s;ians commanded by General Knyphau&s;en, had a thick wood to pa&s;s, where the provincials were advantageou&s;ly po&s;ted, and where a warm engagement was continued for a long time, in which the former was greatly expo&s;ed, and &s;uffered much, though they behaved with much bravery and firmne&s;s. The light infantry were lad on in the mean time, and were expo&s;ed both before and after to a very &s;mart and continual fire from the ene|my, who were covered by the rocks and the trees, a|mong which they were po&s;ted. The troops, howe|ver, with their u&s;ual alertne&s;s and activity, extricated them&s;elves by climbing up a very &s;teep hill, when they di&s;per&s;ed the enemy, and made way for the landing the re&s;t of the troops, without oppo&s;ition. During the&s;e tran&s;actions, Earl Percy having carried an ad|vanced work on his &s;ide, Colonel Stirling was ordered to attempt a landing, and two battalions of the &s;e|cond brigade to &s;upport him. The colonel performed this &s;ervice with great bravery, but with con&s;iderable lo&s;s; he advanced his boats through a heavy fire, which they bore with great firmne&s;s, and forcing his way to a &s;teep place, gained the &s;ummit, and took 170 pri&s;oners, notwith&s;tanding the enemy made a bold and good de|fence. While the&s;e things were carrying on, Colo|nel Rall, who led the column of General Knyphau|&s;en's attack, having forced the enemy, after a con&s;i|derable oppo&s;ition from their &s;trong ports oppo&s;ite to his line, pu&s;hed on to their works, and lodged this co|lumn within an hundred yards of the fort; and being &s;oon joined by the General with the left column, who
<PB N="183" REF="186">had at length overcome the impediments which he met with in the wood, the garri&s;on &s;urrendered pri&s;on|ers of war. The lo&s;s on either &s;ide, according to the public accounts, was not &s;o great as might have been expected from the length and variety of the ac|tion. The quantity of gunpowder found in the fort was utterly inadequate to the purpo&s;e of almo&s;t the &s;horte&s;t defence. A re&s;pectable authority ob&s;erves; how &s;o large a body was left with &s;o poor a provi&s;ion, is extremely unaccountable: And adds, But the nar|rative of all the&s;e tran&s;actions is hitherto imperfect.&mdash; To make this &s;ubject clear to the reader, it mu&s;t be remembered, that the fortifying the&s;e places at this time with &s;o many men, and with &s;o &s;hort provi&s;ions, was intended to an&s;wer a particular de&s;ign, which it did. General Wa&s;hington knew that our troops would attempt &s;torming the fort, provided it did not &s;urrender; he therefore ordered his men to hold out as long as they could with convenient &s;afety, and en|deavour to thin the Briti&s;h ranks as much as po&s;&s;ible, and at la&s;t &s;urrender. Had he left only a few they would have done but little damage to our troops, but as the garri&s;on was tolerably &s;trong and &s;ecured with|in their works, they were on that account able to make a greater &s;laughter among our troops, and &s;o make any future operations more ea&s;y to the provinci|als. The troops in the fort were few in compari&s;on of the killed and wounded of our men in this unhappy attack; for Britain has not to this day, nor ever will, get a true account of the killed and wounded at White Plains and Fort Wa&s;hington. The people in the ci|ty of New York were as great &s;trangers to the tran&s;|actions at White Plains as the people in Britain; for notwith&s;tanding the multitude of killed, that were
<PB N="184" REF="187">every day left upon the field, and the numbers that were carried to the ho&s;pitals, the people were made believe that every little repul&s;e which was given to the Americans was attended with great lo&s;s on their &s;ide, and almo&s;t none on ours. The new&s;papers, under the direction of the commanders in chief by &s;ea and land, like our Gazette at home, always echoed the prai&s;es and victories of our troops, and defamed the coloni&s;ts. not only as rebels, but as cowards that would not fight, but always ran away when an enemy appear|ed. A gentleman, who was above &s;ix months at New York and Long I&s;land, and &s;aw and knew the mo&s;t part of the tran&s;actions from the fir&s;t landing on Staten I&s;land, declared that the number of wounded men which he &s;aw brought in almo&s;t every day, was incredi|ble; but how they happened to be wounded he never could learn; for he was always told that the Americans would not fight, but were perfect cowards. He al&s;o ob&s;erved that he imagined the rea&s;on why our men gave out that there were &s;o few killed, when there were &s;o many wounded, was to cover their real lo&s;s, under the pretence of the provincial fire not doing &s;o much execution as their own. But according to the ob&s;ervations that he made, he found that the killed were as many in proportion to the wounded among our men as among the rebels. The Briti&s;h troops were undoubtedly much thinned by the engagements on White Plains and at Fort Wa&s;hington, and though the be&s;t face was put upon matters that the ca&s;e would admit of, yet it mu&s;t be granted that the Engli&s;h for|ces &s;uffered much and lo&s;t more than they gained by the victory. The provincial commander under&s;tood his own intere&s;t better than to venture upon any ge|neral engagement, to expo&s;e his raw and unexperien|ced
<PB N="185" REF="188">troops, to the fury of men who were de&s;perate, and who con&s;idered even death it&s;elf a &s;ort of victory, as relieving them from con&s;tant fatigue, hunger, and di&s;appointment. He knew that con&s;tant little &s;kir|mi&s;hes would in proce&s;s of time remove from the minds of men the horrors and dread of battle, and teach them to conquer as well as fight. Our men were at fir&s;t flu&s;hed with &s;ucce&s;s, when they &s;aw their enemies flee from one po&s;t to another, and concluded that it was fear that made them retreat, and a &s;en&s;e of their va|lour that made them de&s;ert their po&s;ts: But in this they were mi&s;taken. The Americans only fled, be|cau&s;e it was wi&s;e and prudent to do &s;o, and they con|&s;idered it to be a wi&s;er method to pre&s;erve their troops than expo&s;e them for advantages of &s;mall importance. Many great enemies to America, who were witne&s;&s;es of tho&s;e tran&s;actions, have confe&s;&s;ed of late, that our lo&s;s was greater than it was &s;aid to be at that time, and American cowardice has vani&s;hed away in&s;en&s;ibly, nobody can tell how. The provincials, who were in our Gazettee and court new&s;papers at that time &s;aid to have been three times the number of our men in every battle, have &s;ince, by the &s;ame channel, been proved to have been much inferior in number to Ge|neral Howe's forces in every engagement, both when they lo&s;t and when they gained the day. It is very perplexing to an hi&s;torian when he finds the &s;ame au|thority vary &s;o often upon the &s;ubject, and controvert matters of fact that it has already confirmed in the mo&s;t &s;olemn manner. It is manife&s;t that the truth of facts cannot be certainly a&s;certained by any of the court or mini&s;terial accounts of the&s;e times; for what they have at one time affirmed for truth, they have at another declared to be the gro&s;&s;e&s;t fale&s;hood. Truth
<PB N="186" REF="189">is mo&s;t likely to be found from the American records, who, though they may have coloured &s;ome points &s;trongly, yet have &s;upported con&s;i&s;tency in their pub|lications of matters of fact concerning this war.</P>
<P>When our troops had fini&s;hed the conque&s;t of Fort Wa&s;hington, they next proceeded to over-run the Jer&s;ies, and Lord Cornwallis was &s;ent with a &s;trong body of men to attack Fort Lee. The garri|&s;on of two thou&s;and abandoned the fort, and left their &s;tores, artillery, and tents behind them. Our troops after this over-run the greate&s;t part of the Jer|&s;ies, without oppo&s;ition; the enemy every way flying before them, and at length extended their winter can|tonments from New Brun&s;wick to the Delaware. It was thought, had they had means of pa&s;&s;ing the Dela|ware, they might have taken Philadelphia, when the people were in a con&s;ternation at their progre&s;s; but the Americans were &s;o prudent as either to de&s;troy or carry off all the boats upon that river.</P>
<P>While the&s;e things were carrying on in the Jer&s;ies, General Clinton, with &s;ome Briti&s;h and He&s;&s;ian troops, and a &s;quadron of &s;hips under Sir Peter Parker, were &s;ent to make an attack upon Rhode I&s;land. They &s;ucceeded ea&s;ily in this enterprize. Upon December the 8th, the provincials abandoned the i&s;land, and the Briti&s;h and He&s;&s;ian troops took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it, with|out any lo&s;s, and at the &s;ame time blocked up Com|modore Hopkins's &s;quadron, which was in the har|bours of Providence, on the adjoining continent.&mdash; The Engli&s;h &s;quadron and troops continued here dur|ing the winter, where they had better quarters than any other of the King's troops. Hitherto the King's forces had &s;ucceeded in all their attempts &s;ince their landing in Staten I&s;land. The provincial army was
<PB N="187" REF="190">much decrea&s;ed, both by captivity and de&s;ertion, but they always found new &s;ources of recruit and &s;upply, which much a&s;toni&s;hed our Generals, as well as it a|larmed the government.</P>

<P>AS the progre&s;s of the Briti&s;h arms in Canada had been much retarded by many unfor&s;een accidents, as well as by the want of wi&s;dom in the cabinet, it was now propo&s;ed to pur&s;ue the war with more vigour in tho&s;e parts. Some &s;trong efforts had been made in 1776 to remove the ob&s;tacles that had &s;o long re|&s;trained its progre&s;s, and the officers employed in that &s;ervice had &s;urmounted wondrous difficulties. The
<PB N="189" REF="192">burden of this &s;ervice fell upon the officers and men in that quarter of the world, who&s;e abilities, zeal, and per&s;everance, were worthy of the prai&s;es of tho&s;e who employed them. It was an arduous ta&s;k they were at this time to perform. They had almo&s;t to create a fleet of above thirty fighting ve&s;&s;els of differ|ent &s;orts and &s;izes, all furni&s;hed with cannon, which was a very &s;tupendous work; for though &s;ome of tho&s;e that were at this time built were con&s;tructed from old ve&s;&s;els, the advantage, except what was de|rived from the materials, was very little. The labour in forming and building them was much the &s;ame as if the materials had been new. But this was not the harde&s;t part of the labour, nor the greate&s;t difficulty that &s;tood in the way of the progre&s;s of this expedi|tion. The&s;e ve&s;&s;els were to be tran&s;ported over land, and dragged up rapids again&s;t the &s;tream for a con&s;i|derable length of way. It was a ta&s;k of great magni|tude to carry 30 long boats, a number of flat boats, a gondola, weighing 90 tons, and 400 batteaux, up the rapids of There&s;a and St. John's. The labour attending the execution of this work, appeared &s;o grievous and perplexed, that it even damped the vi|gour of the Engli&s;h &s;eamen. They did not indeed bear the whole burden of this work; the &s;oldiers had al&s;o their &s;hare in the labour and fatigue; and, what was both unrea&s;onable and a thing to be lamented, the pea&s;ants and country people of Canada were taken from their ploughs and other employments, and com|pelled by power to bear a &s;hare in toils and labor, from which they could derive neither honour nor advan|tage. The whole proceeding had more the appear|ance of a project of Knight errantry, than a &s;cheme of any utility for &s;ubduing the coloni&s;ts. It &s;hewed
<PB N="190" REF="193">what zeal and &s;trength could do, rather than di&s;cover|ed what rea&s;on would have &s;ugge&s;ted to men endowed with rational powers and faculties.</P>
<P>This equipment was completed in the &s;pace of three months, but the nature of the &s;ervice required that it &s;hould have been done &s;ooner. The winter was fa&s;t approaching, two inland &s;eas to be pa&s;&s;ed, the force of the enemy, which was not known, was to be conquered, and the &s;trong po&s;ts of Crown Point and Ticonderago defended and &s;upported by them, were to be encountered &s;word in hand.</P>
<P>To the&s;e impediments were added the communica|tions between the Lakes Champlain and St. George, did not admit the pa&s;&s;age of tho&s;e ve&s;&s;els of force, which, though &s;ucce&s;sful in the one, might be equally wanted in the other. And though all the&s;e difficult|ies were &s;urmounted, and Lake George pa&s;&s;ed, there &s;till remained a long and dangerous march, through intricate fore&s;ts, wide mora&s;&s;es, and an uncleared country, &s;till in a &s;tate of nature, before they could reach Albany, which was the fir&s;t po&s;t to the &s;outh|ward that could afford them the &s;malle&s;t accomodation. The&s;e difficulties vani&s;hed in the eyes of commanders who had promi&s;ed much, and imagined that the rug|gedness of the way would be the greate&s;t impediment in their way to Albany. The force of the provinci|als was &s;carcely ever taken into the account. The objects which they had in view were great, the glory to be obtained tempting, and their anxious de&s;ire of obtaining the end which they had in view &s;eemed to le&s;&s;en difficulties which would have been in&s;urmounta|ble to per&s;ons of a cold and languid re&s;olution. They &s;ugge&s;ted to them&s;elves, that provided they could re|cover the Lakes and reach Albany before the &s;everity
<PB N="191" REF="194">of winter &s;et in, the northern army would have a prin|cipal &s;hare in the glory of bringing the war to a pe|riod. They imagined that they could pour ruin at their plea&s;ure either into the heart of the middle or of the northern colonies, each of which would be ex|posed to them in its mo&s;t tender and defencele&s;s parts. Whil&s;t Hud&s;on's River would &s;ecure their communi|cation with General Howe, it would likewi&s;e &s;eparate and di&s;connect the &s;outhern and Northern colonies, leaving the latter to fall under the weight of both ar|mies, or to accept of &s;uch terms as they could ob|tain, without the participation of their brethren in the &s;outh. Nor could General Wa&s;hington attempt to hold any po&s;t in New York, or the Jer&s;ies, with &s;uch a &s;uperiority of force as already oppre&s;&s;ed him in front, and Carleton's army in his rear.</P>
<P>The &s;ucce&s;s of the forces on the &s;ide of New York, encrea&s;ed the ardour and impatience, as well as the jealou&s;y of this northern army, every one imagining that the war would be over before he could have an opportunity of &s;haring in the honour of the event.</P>
<P>In all the&s;e &s;peculations they forgot that the Briti&s;h navy could not a&s;&s;i&s;t them in their way to Albany after they pa&s;&s;ed the lakes, and that whatever progre&s;s the troops in New York had made, that it was more ow|ing to the countenance of the navy, than their own intrepidity, that they had &s;ucceeded. They could ex|pect no &s;hips of war to enfilade the enemy at Still Wa|ter, or Saratoga; and in ca&s;e they were violently at|tacked in &s;ome fore&s;t or &s;wamp, they would have no war &s;hips to defend them, nor tran&s;ports to carry them off. It has been an infatuation that has con&s;tantly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the conductors of this war, that the valour and intrepidity of the Briti&s;h forces could &s;urmount
<PB N="192" REF="195">every difficulty, and that the provincials were ab&s;o|lute cowards and poltroons, that dur&s;t not face arm|ed men. This language, even in the mid&s;t of all our defeats and di&s;graces, has been continually u&s;ed by e|very mini&s;terial hireling, both at home and abroad.&mdash; There could certainly be little honour or glory obtain|ed by brave men beating cowards, and when the prow|e&s;s of the Briti&s;h troops has been extolled to the &s;kies, the Americans have always been repre&s;ented as the greate&s;t cowards.</P>
<P>Though our troops pur&s;ued their work with the mo&s;t unremitted ardour and indu&s;try, yet it was not till the month of October that the new fleet was in condition to &s;eek the enemy upon Lake Champlain.&mdash; The force was now con&s;iderable with re&s;pect to the place and &s;ervice, and extraordinary with re&s;pect to the time &s;pent in preparing it; and &s;uch as in former times would have been accounted a re&s;pectable force even upon the European &s;eas. The &s;hip called the Inflexible, which was the Admiral's, had been new con&s;tructed at St. John's in 28 days from the time of laying her keel, and mounted 18 &s;ix pounders. One &s;chooner mounted 14, and another 12 &s;ix pounders, be&s;ides howizers; and a gondola, 7 nine pounders; twenty &s;mall ve&s;&s;els, under the denomination of gun|boats, carried bra&s;s field pieces from 9 to 24 pound|ers, or were armed with howitzers.&mdash;Some long boats were furni&s;hed in the &s;ame manner. About an equal number of large boats acted as tenders. Tho&s;e that have been mentioned were all intended for war ve&s;|&s;els. There were be&s;ides the&s;e a great number ap|pointed for the tran&s;portation of the army, with its &s;tores, artillery, baggage, and provi&s;ions.</P>

<P>The armament was conducted by Captain Pringle, and the fleet navigated by 700 prime &s;eamen, of whom 200 were volunteers from the tran&s;ports, who after having rivalled tho&s;e belonging to the &s;hips of war in all the toils of preparation, now boldly and free|ly joined with them in the danger of the expedition. The guns were &s;erved by detachments of men and offi|cers belonging to the corps of artillery. No equip|ment of the kind was ever better appointed, or more amply furni&s;hed with all kinds of provi&s;ions for the in|tended expedition. The force of the provincials up|on the Lakes was in no re&s;pect equal to that which was &s;ent again&s;t them, either with regard to the good|ne&s;s of the ve&s;&s;els, the number of guns, furniture of war, or weight of metal. Though the coloni&s;ts were &s;en&s;ible of the nece&s;&s;ity of pre&s;erving the dominion of the lakes, and a&s;&s;i&s;ted in that de&s;ign with the original force in their hands, with a great advantage in point of time for its increa&s;e, their intentions in that re&s;pect were counteracted by many e&s;&s;ential, and &s;ome in&s;ur|mountable deficiencies. They wanted timber, &s;hip|builders, artillery, and all the materials nece&s;&s;ary for &s;uch an equipment. Carpenters and all others con|cerned in &s;hip-building were fully employed at the &s;ea ports, in con&s;tructing and fitting out privateers, whil&s;t the remotene&s;s and the difficulty of the com|munication, rendered the &s;upply of bulky materials extremely tedious.</P>
<P>Con&s;idering the difficulties they had to combat, the coloni&s;ts di&s;covered a great degree of ingenuity, fore|ca&s;t, and a&s;&s;iduity, and &s;hewed as much &s;pirit and per|&s;everence as their enemies had employed again&s;t them. Their fleet amounted to fifteen ve&s;&s;els of different kinds, con&s;i&s;ting of two &s;chooners, one &s;loop, one cutter,
<PB N="194" REF="198">three gallies, and eight gondolas. The principal mounted twelve &s;ix and four pounders. They were commanded by Benedict Arnold, who had now to &s;up|port, upon a new element, the reputation he had gain|ed by a Canada expedition. And, con&s;idering the di&s;advantages he had to combat, gained as much ho|nour as a &s;ea officer, as he had done as a general of a land army.</P>
<P>Upon the 11th of October, General Carleton pro|ceeded up the Lake, and di&s;covered the enemy's fleet drawn up with great judgment, being po&s;ted in a very advantageous &s;ituation, and forming a &s;trong line to defend the pa&s;&s;age between the i&s;land Volicour and the we&s;tern main. They had at fir&s;t placed them&s;elves with &s;o much &s;kill behind the i&s;land, that their &s;itua|tion was only di&s;covered by accident. Had not the royal &s;quadron di&s;covered their &s;ituation in due time, they would left them behind, an event, provided it had happened, that would have been attended with the mo&s;t &s;erious con&s;equences. It has been &s;aid, that the appearance of a three ma&s;ted &s;hip upon the Lakes threw the provincials into the utmo&s;t confu&s;ion. It does not appear however that a matter of &s;uch pub|lic nature &s;hould have been &s;o long concealed from them. The confu&s;ion of the coloni&s;ts at the &s;ight of the King's troops was at that time very common &s;tile, and con&s;tantly affirmed by the friends of the mini&s;try. The King's forces found in experience that they had more to do than merely to cro&s;s the Lakes. A &s;evere battle en&s;ued, and was vigorou&s;ly maintained on both &s;ides; but the wind proving unfavourable, &s;o that the &s;hip Inflexible, and &s;ome other ve&s;&s;els of force, could not be worked up to the enemy, the weight of the ac|tion fell upon the &s;chooner Carleton, and the gun|boats,
<PB N="195" REF="199">which they &s;u&s;tained with great firmne&s;s.&mdash; Such amazing efforts of re&s;olution were di&s;played, it was &s;aid, by both men and officers as received the ap|plau&s;e of the commanders. This plainly &s;uppo&s;es that as &s;o much prai&s;e was thought due to the Briti&s;h &s;u|perior force, that the provincials had not behaved as cowards, but mu&s;t have made a &s;tout re&s;i&s;tance.&mdash; The detachment from the corps of artillery were highly di&s;tingui&s;hed, and performed the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential &s;ervice in the gun boats. But the &s;ame impediments &s;till continuing, Captain Pringle, with the con&s;ent of the General, thought it nece&s;&s;ary for the pre&s;ent to withdraw tho&s;e that were engaged, from the action. At the approach of night he brought the whole fleet to anchor in a line, and as near as po&s;&s;ible to the e|nemy, in order to prevent their retreat. The King's forces had not much to boa&s;t of in this action, though the Americans &s;uffered &s;everely, having one of their be&s;t &s;chooners burnt, and a gondola, carrying three or four guns, &s;unk. It is rea&s;onable to &s;uppo&s;e, that their other ve&s;&s;els &s;uffered in &s;ome proportion. They were &s;en&s;ible of their inferiority, and took the oppor|tunity of the night of endeavouring to e&s;cape under the protection of Crown Point. Arnold planned and executed th&s;s de&s;ign with great ability, and &s;o far &s;uc|ceeded that they were out of &s;ight next morning.&mdash; The chace was however continued without intermi&s;|&s;ion, both on that and the following day, and the wind at la&s;t changing, which had been at fir&s;t favour|able to the Americans, became otherwi&s;e, &s;o that they were overtaken and brought to action a few leagues from Crown Point, about the middle of the day, up|on the 13th of October.</P>
<PB N="196" REF="200">
<P>A warm engagement now en&s;ued, which continued for upwards of two hours, wherein the coloni&s;ts made a bold re&s;i&s;tance, and made the King's troops feel what they never expected. During the time of the battle, tho&s;e ve&s;&s;els that were a-head pu&s;hed on to Crown Point, and pa&s;&s;ing it, e&s;caped to Ticondera|go; but two gallies and five gondolas, which remain|ed with Arnold, made a de&s;perate re&s;i&s;tance. During this action the Wa&s;hington galley, with Waterberg, a Brigadier-General, and the &s;econd in command on board, &s;truck, and was taken. Arnold at la&s;t found that it was impo&s;&s;ible to with&s;tand the &s;uperiority of force with which he was now attacked, and al&s;o found him&s;elf but badly &s;upported by &s;ome of the Captains of the ve&s;&s;els, he was determined that his men &s;hould not be made pri&s;oners, nor his ve&s;&s;els fall into the hands of his enemies. This almo&s;t &s;eemed impo&s;&s;ible to be prevented; but Arnold, who&s;e genius was fruitful of re&s;ources, executed this de&s;ign with equal dexterity and re&s;olution, and run the Congre&s;s gal|ley, in which he him&s;elf was, with the five gondolas on &s;hore, in &s;uch a manner as to land the men &s;afely, and blow up the ve&s;&s;els, in &s;pite of every effort that was made to prevent it. The re&s;olution of this in|trepid officer &s;truck even his enemies with &s;urpri&s;e, and gave the Engli&s;h commander to under&s;tand, that he had now to engage with one who was in ear|ne&s;t, and who would lo&s;e no opportunity to make the mo&s;t of both misfortunes and advantages. This de|feat did not le&s;&s;en, but rai&s;ed Arnold in the e&s;teem of his countrymen. He was prai&s;ed and applauded for his conduct, and it was &s;aid that he had not only behaved like a brave &s;oldier, but that he had fully ex|ecuted the duty of an able naval commander. That
<PB N="197" REF="201">the mo&s;t experienced &s;eamen could not have found a greatet number of re&s;ources, by the dexterity of his manoeuvres and evolutions, and the mo&s;t advantageous choice of &s;ituation, to compen&s;ate for the want of force than he did; and when his ve&s;&s;els were almo&s;t torn to pieces, he retreated with the &s;ame re&s;olution that he had fought; and by the mo&s;t happy and mo&s;t criti|cal judgment, prevented his men and &s;hips from fal|ling into the hands of the enemy. But they chiefly gloried in the dangerous attention he paid to a nice point of honour, in keeping his flag flying, and not quitting his galley till &s;he was in flames, le&s;t the ene|my &s;hould have boarded and &s;truck it. Such intrepe|dity in any of the Briti&s;h commanders would have been echoed in all the venal new&s;papers throughout the kingdom, and con&s;idered as an act of heroi&s;m of un|common magnitude.</P>
<P>Lake Champlain was now recovered, and the pro|vincial force thereon nearly de&s;troyed, a galley and three &s;trong ve&s;&s;els being all that e&s;caped to Ticonde|rago; but the de&s;ign of this expedition was far from being fulfilled. Much was to be done before the nor|thern army could co-operate with General Howe.&mdash; The provincials upon the defeat of their little fleet, &s;et fire to Crown Point, and de&s;troyed every thing which they could not carry away, and left the place, and returned to the main body at Ticonderago. Ge|neral Carleton took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the ruins, where he was &s;oon joined by the army. He remained there near a month, when winter began to approach, which is &s;evere in the&s;e parts, &s;o it was not practicable to pur|&s;ue the pre&s;ent advantages far. Detachments and re|connoitering parties advanced at one time on both &s;ides of the Lake, and proceeded within a &s;mall di&s;|tance
<PB N="198" REF="202">of Ticonderago, at the &s;ame time that &s;ome &s;py ve&s;&s;els appeared within cannon &s;hot of the works, to examine the nature of the channel and &s;ound its depth. It was believed that the General ordered this to be done with a de&s;ign to attack the place, and that he had this project in contemplation. But the &s;trength of the works, the difficulties of the approach, the countenance of the enemy, and the ignorance of their number, with other forcible rea&s;ons, prevented this de&s;ign from being executed.</P>
<P>It appeared evident that this po&s;t could not be for|ced without con&s;iderable lo&s;s of men, whil&s;t the advan|tages ari&s;ing from &s;ucce&s;s would have been compara|tively nothing. Though even the provincials had been vanqui&s;hed, and the King's troops had met with no more re&s;i&s;tance, yet they could not, like the New Englanders, march in winter through woods and thickets, in the mid&s;t of &s;now and rain, and carry their baggage and artillery along with them. This was a part of military excerci&s;e that our Generals were not acquainted with, and which they did not chu&s;e to put in practice. To march on foot at the head of an army up to the knees in &s;now, to plunge through mud, to pa&s;s rivulets and waters up to the middle, to lye all night upon &s;now in the open field, were ma|noeuvres of warfare that even General Carleton had not e&s;&s;ayed. To Arnold this would have been a ta&s;k of difficulty, but he would have attempted it, and al&s;o performed it. Our men might have in &s;ome de|gree gone through the fatigue, but it would have been impo&s;&s;ible for a great many of the officers to have endured it.</P>
<P>The &s;ea&s;on was &s;o far advanced, that the pa&s;&s;ing of Lake George could not be undertaken without ex|po&s;ing
<PB N="199" REF="203">the army to a winter campaign in the inho&s;pi|table and impracticable wilds towards the &s;outh. All that could be expected from the taking of Ticondera|ga was only the reduction of works which were more indebted to nature than art for their &s;trength, and perhaps a few cannon; but as the army could not &s;tay there during the winter, the former might be re|paired and the latter replaced by the provin|cials, before the army could interrupt their proceed|ings in the en&s;uing &s;ummer. But if the defence &s;hould be ob&s;tinate, although the King's troops &s;hould be &s;ucce&s;sful, the army would thereby be &s;o much weakened, that all the pro&s;pect of advantage for the future would in a great mea&s;ure be rendered void.&mdash; The difficulty of keeping open the communication with Canada, and &s;ub&s;i&s;ting the army during the win|ter, appeared obvious. General Carleton therefore re-embarked the army, without attempting to reduce Ticonderago, and cantoned his men in Canada for the winter in the be&s;t manner the country could afford.&mdash; It is manife&s;t that the Briti&s;h forces in gaining the do|minion of the Lake Champlain, met with a re&s;i&s;tance which they did not expect, and that the vigour of Ge|neral Carleton for an immediate campaign was &s;uffi|ciently abated. Had he pur&s;ued his cour&s;e with as much re&s;olution as Arnold did his expedition to Cana|da in the former year, there is rea&s;on to conclude that he might have reached Albany without much op|po&s;ition. But the troops and ve&s;&s;els had met with a more vigourous oppo&s;ition than was expected, and the lo&s;s of the King's forces was greater than e|ver the public were made acquainted with. But it has been the continued practice throughout the whole
<PB N="200" REF="204">war to conceal from the nation the lo&s;&s;es which were &s;u&s;tained in the engagements with the coloni&s;ts.</P>
<P>It may be now nece&s;&s;ary to take a view of the pro|gre&s;s of the war in the &s;outh, and con&s;ider the tran&s;|actions of the grand army in New York and the Jer|&s;ies. &mdash;Near the conclu&s;ion of the la&s;t cam|paign, Lord Cornwallis had almo&s;t over-run the Jer&s;ies, and had approached near to Philadelphia.&mdash; Nothing, except the Delaware, appeared to be an im|pediment in the way of the royal army, becoming ma&s;ters of the city of Philadelphia and the adjoining provinces. The Americans had at this time no army competent to re&s;i&s;t the progre&s;s of the royal forces. The period of time that Wa&s;hington's army had been enli&s;ted was now expired, and the greate&s;t part of his men were gone home to their re&s;pective places of a|bode. It was &s;aid, that the number of his forces that continued embodied did not exceed three thou&s;and men. At the opening of the campaign his army was rated at twenty-five thou&s;and, and &s;ome affirmed that at that time it was more numerous, but now it was greatly reduced, and &s;carcely exceeded three thou&s;and effective troops. Some &s;mall parties from per&s;onal attachment, local circum&s;tances, or a &s;uperior per&s;e|verance or bravery, &s;till continued with the Gene|rals Wa&s;hington and Lee, but were &s;o incon&s;iderable a force as not to demand much attention from the royal army. It required &s;ome time to rai&s;e a new army, which in the mean time could afford but little a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance or comfort to the coloni&s;ts.</P>
<P>About this time an accident happened which was very detrimental to the intere&s;t of America, and tend|ed much to di&s;courage the colonies. This was the taking of General Lee. That officer, at the head of
<PB N="201" REF="205">a party of men, being on his march to join General Wa&s;hington, who had a&s;&s;embled the Pen&s;ylvania mi|litia to &s;ecure the banks of the Delaware was from the di&s;tance of the Briti&s;h cantonments betrayed into a fatal &s;ecurity, by which, in cro&s;&s;ing the uppermo&s;t part of New Jer&s;ey, from the North River, he fixed his quarters, and lay, carele&s;ly guarded, at &s;ome di&s;tance from the main body. He was betrayed by an inhabi|tant, for the &s;ake of a reward, who informed Colonel Harcourt of the &s;ituation he was in, who having made an excur&s;ion at the head of a &s;mall detachment of light hor&s;e, conducted his mea&s;ures with &s;o much addre&s;s and &s;ecrecy, that the guard was evaded, the centuries &s;eized without noi&s;e, the quarters forced, and Lee car|ried off, though all that part of the country was in his favour, and that &s;everal guard po&s;ts and armed pa|troles lay in the way. There &s;eems to have been much carele&s;sne&s;s in the conduct of the General on this occa&s;ion, and but little judgment in tho&s;e who formed the po&s;ts, and &s;et up the patrole. Had the po&s;ts and patroles been placed as they ought to have been in the time of war and inva&s;ion, it would have been impo&s;&s;ible for one hor&s;eman to have gone over &s;uch a tract of country, to &s;ay nothing of a detach|ment, without alarming the inhabitants, and a&s;&s;embling tho&s;e that had arms. The &s;malle&s;t and the mo&s;t &s;e|cret po&s;tern way ought not to be neglected, from the margin of the &s;ea bank to the centre of a country, and from the centre to the extremities of the whole. General Lee acted at this time with as little judgment as he did with care; for provided he had con&s;ulted the dictates of political wi&s;dom and &s;agacity, he would have kept the &s;tricte&s;t guard to have &s;hewn the peo|ple an example, to put them in mind of the danger
<PB N="202" REF="206">they were in from a vigilant enemy, that watched every opportunity to take an advantage. By neglect|ing this practice, he, to his &s;ad experience, &s;hewed an example of the truth of this ob&s;ervation.</P>
<P>In many ca&s;es the making a &s;ingle officer pri&s;oner would have been a thing of very little con&s;ideration or moment; but in the then &s;tate of America, when their forces were raw, a general deficiency of milita|ry &s;kill prevailed, and the inexperience of the offi|cers was even a greater grievance than the want of di&s;cipline among the &s;oldiers. In &s;uch a ca&s;e the lo&s;s of a commander, who&s;e &s;pirit of enterpri&s;e was direct|ed by great &s;kill in his profe&s;&s;ion, acquired by active as well as actual &s;ervice, was of the utmo&s;t importance, and the more di&s;tre&s;&s;ing, as there was little ground to hope that it could be &s;oon &s;upplied.</P>
<P>As General Lee was con&s;idered by tho&s;e at home as the very chief of all the American officers, it was imagined that his being taken would have had a con&s;i|derable effect upon di&s;tre&s;&s;ing the coloni&s;ts, and putting an end to the war. The rejoicing among the tories and jacobites, on account of this event, was &s;carcely prudent, decent, or becoming. Some per&s;onal ani|mo&s;ity between Mr Lee and &s;ome other officers in the army, as well as per&s;ons of power at court, were &s;up|po&s;ed to have contributed not a little to the triumph and exultation on that occa&s;ion. The taking of Gene|ral Lee was al&s;o attended with a circum&s;tance which has produced much inconvenience on both &s;ides, and of much pain and calamity to many individuals. Not long before this accident a cartel, or &s;omething of the like nature, had been e&s;tabli&s;hed for the exchange of pri&s;oners between the Generals Howe and Wa&s;hing|ton, which had been carried into execution &s;o far as
<PB N="203" REF="207">time and circum&s;tances would admit. As General Lee was particularly obnoxious to government, it was &s;aid, and &s;uppo&s;ed, that General Howe was con|fined by his in&s;tructions from parting with him upon any condition, provided the fortune of war &s;hould put him into his power. General Wa&s;hington not having at this time any pri&s;oner of rank equal to Lee, propo&s;|ed to exchange &s;ix field officers for him; the number being intended to balance the de&s;parity: or if this was refu&s;ed, that he might be treated and con&s;idered ac|cording to his &s;tation, according to the practice of all civilized and poli&s;hed nations, and the precedent which the Americans had already &s;hewn with regard to Bri|ti&s;h officers in their hands, until an opportunity offer|ed for a direct and equal change. The pride of our mini&s;try, and the pre&s;ent &s;pirit of the Briti&s;h officers were rai&s;ed to a degree a little too high to li&s;ten to any reque&s;t of this nature from a rebel commander in chief. It was expected that in a little time the colo|ni&s;ts would be brought to the feet of the mini&s;ter, and General Lee would be dealt with as a &s;tate pri&s;oner, and treated as one of the chiefs in the rebellion. Pro|&s;criptions of a great extent were meditated, and there was nothing wanting but &s;ucce&s;s to let the world &s;ee how mini&s;terial vengeance would be executed. Ge|neral Wa&s;hington therefore received for an&s;wer, that as Mr Lee was a de&s;erter from his Maje&s;ty's &s;ervice, he was not to be con&s;idered as a pri&s;oner of war; that he had not at all come within the conditions of a car|tel, nor could he receive any of its benefits. General Lee had re&s;igned his half pay at the beginning of the American conte&s;t, and was none of his Maje&s;ty's offi|cers. He could only be con&s;idered as a &s;ubject of go|vernment, like the re&s;t of tho&s;e who were in arms in
<PB N="204" REF="208">America, and in no re&s;pect came under the de&s;crip|tion of a de&s;erter from his Maje&s;ty's &s;ervice. In the propo&s;als for a cartel no particular exceptions of per|&s;ons had been made, and General Wa&s;hington treated this doctrine of the mini&s;try with the utmo&s;t contempt.</P>
<P>In the mean time Lee was confined in the clo&s;e&s;t manner, and watched and guarded with all the &s;trict|ne&s;s and jealou&s;y which a &s;tate criminal could have experienced in the mo&s;t dangerous political conjunc|ture. This conduct not only &s;u&s;pended the cartel, but induced retaliation on the other &s;ide; &s;o that Colonel Campbell, who had hitherto enjoyed every degree of liberty con&s;i&s;tent with his condition, and had been treated with great humanity by the people of Bo&s;ton, was now thrown into a dungeon, and treated with a rigour equal to the indulgence he had formerly expe|rienced. &mdash;The officers who were pri&s;oners in the &s;outhern colonies, though they were not treated &s;o &s;everely as Colonel Campbell, were however deprived of their parole liberty, and other conveniences, which made their &s;ituation uncommonly ea&s;y. It was de|clared that their future treatment &s;hould, in every de|gree be regulated by that which General Lee experi|enced, and that their per&s;ons should be an&s;werable in the utmo&s;t extent for any violence that was offered to him. According to the rules of ju&s;tice, our mini&s;try could expect no other &s;ort of conduct from the colo|ni&s;ts towards our officers, and whatever might hap|pen to them, the blame mu&s;t have re&s;ted upon them|&s;elves.</P>
<P>According to the boa&s;ting of that time, General Lee was to have been brought over to England to be tri|ed as a &s;tate pri&s;oner, and there is no que&s;tion, that if the mini&s;try had not been embarra&s;&s;ed with regard to
<PB N="205" REF="209">their own officers which were pri&s;oners in America, General Lee would have felt their vengeance to the utmo&s;t extent. But though he was particularly ill u&s;ed for a time, the &s;ituation of many Briti&s;h officers pre&s;erved him from the vengeance that was intended for him.</P>
<P>In the mid&s;t of the &s;everal trying circum&s;tances which happened about this time, the American con|gre&s;s &s;hewed a wonderful &s;teadine&s;s and re&s;olution.&mdash; Far from de&s;ponding, or giving way to any thing like unconditional &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, they made no overtures to|wards any &s;ort of an accomodation. Pride, &s;hame, and the hope of &s;ubduing the coloni&s;ts, prevented the government to make any propo&s;als of accomodation to the congre&s;s. The coloni&s;ts, as was nece&s;&s;ary in their pre&s;ent &s;ituation, prepared to renew the war with all the vigour they were ma&s;ters of, and to repair their &s;hattered forces with the utmo&s;t diligence. It was imagined that by their lo&s;&s;es in the Jer&s;ies, and in other parts of the continent, that they would never be able again to make any re&s;i&s;tance again&s;t the King's forces; and that the lo&s;s of General Lee would totally break their &s;pirits. But all the&s;e events only rou&s;ed them the more, and called forth into exerci&s;e every latent principal of exertion that remained in their &s;ouls.&mdash; They were now convinced that temporary armies were not competent for the great object they had in view, and that though men engaged for a &s;hort and li|mited time might repel a &s;udden inva&s;ion, yet when op|po&s;ed to the con&s;tant attacks of a powerful enemy, and the continual efforts of regular forces, they were far from being &s;ufficient. They found in experience, that they could not hope with an army of new men, changed every year, to make any effectual &s;tand again&s;t
<PB N="206" REF="210">veteran troops, and their pre&s;ent critical &s;ituation did not permit time for changes of trained men for new levies, which for &s;ome time could be of little &s;ervice. To remedy this evil for the future, which could not be guarded again&s;t at pre&s;ent, the congre&s;s i&s;&s;ued orders about the middle of September for levying 88 batta|lions, the &s;oldiers being bound by the terms of enli&s;t|ment to &s;erve during the continuance of the war.</P>
<P>The number of battalions which each colony was by this ordinance appointed to rai&s;e and &s;upport, may be con&s;idered as nearly an exact political &s;cale of their comparative &s;trength framed by tho&s;e who were in|tere&s;ted in its correctne&s;s, and well acquainted with their re&s;pective circum&s;tances. Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ett's Bay and Virginia were the highe&s;t in the &s;cale, being to fur|ni&s;h 15 battalions each; Penn&s;ylvania came next, and was rated at 12, North Carolina 9; Connecticut and Maryland 8 each; New York and the Jer&s;ies each 4, the latter being con&s;idered as one government.&mdash; This was the pre&s;ent compliment of men to be rai&s;|ed to make up a &s;tanding army during the continuance of the war, and when full, were thought &s;ufficient for any emergency. It mu&s;t be allowed that the con|gre&s;s took every rational &s;tep to form this army, and the army when rai&s;ed did not di&s;appoint their expect|ations. Money was not wanted, nor any encourage|ment that could be given to animate the &s;pirits of the people to enli&s;t.</P>
<P>The liberality of the congre&s;s in its encourage|ment to the troops was proportioned to the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;peedily completing the new army. They not on|ly gave a bounty of twenty dollars to each &s;oldier at the time of enli&s;ting, but allotted lands at the end of the war to &s;uch as &s;urvived, and to the repre&s;entatives
<PB N="207" REF="211">of all that &s;hould happen to be &s;lain in battle in differ|ent &s;tated proportions, from 500 acres, the allotment of a Colonel, to 150, which was that of an En&s;ign; the private men and the non-commi&s;&s;ioned officers were to have 100 acres each.&mdash;To prevent the thoughtle&s;s, the prodigal, or worthle&s;s, obtaining for trifles what was due to the brave and meritorious, for their blood and &s;ervices, all the&s;e lands were render|ed unalienable during the war, no a&s;&s;ignment being to be admitted at its conclu&s;ion. The congre&s;s had be|fore, as an encouragement to their forces, decreed, that all their officers, by &s;ea or land, who were or might be di&s;abled in action, &s;hould receive during life, one half of the monthly pay to which they were en|titled by their rank in the &s;ervice, at the time of their meeting with the misfortune. Though the&s;e encou|ragements were great, yet it appears as if the condi|tion of &s;erving during the war was not generally a|greeable to a people &s;o little accu&s;tomed to any kind of &s;ubordination and re&s;traint. So that in the month of November the congre&s;s found it nece&s;&s;ary to admit of another mode of enli&s;ting for the term of three years. This was certainly more rea&s;onable, though perhaps it might not an&s;wer the purpo&s;e of a &s;tanding army &s;o well. According to this new mode, the &s;ol|diers were to receive the &s;ame bounty with others, but were cut out from any allotments of lands. It has been affirmed by the people at home that even after all the&s;e encouragements that the bu&s;ine&s;s of re|cruiting went on &s;lowly. But this does not at all ap|pear; for when the time of action called them forth, we do not find that their armies were deficient; and even the Briti&s;h mini&s;ter in the &s;enate affirmed, though
<PB N="208" REF="212">afterwards he changed his tone, that they were dou|ble in number to the King's forces.</P>
<P>The rea&s;on of making promi&s;es of land to the &s;oldi|ers was intended to be a counter-balance to a &s;imilar mea&s;ure adopted by the crown.&mdash;Large grants of vacant lands were made, to be di&s;tributed at the end of the troubles to every one of the royal highland emigrants, and &s;ome other new rai&s;ed troops in Ame|rica, as a reward for their expected zeal and loyalty in the reduction of the coloni&s;ts. A mea&s;ure which tended more to excite and increa&s;e the animo&s;ity of the people, than any others which could have been devi&s;ed in &s;uch circum&s;tances. For they univer&s;ally con&s;idered the term vacant as &s;ignifying the &s;ame thing as forfeited, which being an effect of the trea&s;on laws yet unknown in America, excited the greater hor|ror; the people being well aware, from the experi|ence of other countries, that if the &s;weets of forfeiture were once ta&s;ted it would be equally happy and unu|&s;ual if any other limits than tho&s;e which nature had a&s;&s;igned, could re&s;train its operation. The annual &s;upplies rai&s;ed in the colonies by their re&s;pective a&s;|&s;emblies being in&s;ufficient to provide for the extraordi|nary expences of &s;o large an army, together with other numerous contingencies in&s;eperable from &s;uch a war, the congre&s;s found it nece&s;&s;ary to negociate a loan to an&s;wer the&s;e purpo&s;es. They accordingly pa&s;&s;ed a re|&s;olution to borrow five millions of dollars at an intere&s;t of four per cent, and to pledge the faith of the Unit|ed States for the payment of both principal and inte|re&s;t.</P>
<P>The wi&s;dom and prudence of the congre&s;s did not for&s;ake them in the time of the greate&s;t hardships;&mdash; they always &s;ound expedients and re&s;ources an&s;wera|ble to the exigencies of their affairs. In this critical
<PB N="209" REF="213">&s;ituation of their country, when the pre&s;ervation of their country, and the pre&s;ervation of Philadelphia was almo&s;t hopele&s;s, and a time when Lord Cornwal|lis had over-run the Jer&s;ies, and the Briti&s;h forces had taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the towns and po&s;ts on the Delaware, the congre&s;s publi&s;hed an addre&s;s to the people in general, but more particularly to tho&s;e of Philadelphia and the neighbouring &s;tates. The inten|tion of this addre&s;s was to awaken the attention of the people, remove their de&s;pondency, renew their hopes and &s;pirits, and confirm their intentions of &s;upporting the war, by &s;hewing that no other means were left for the pre&s;ervation of their rights and liberties, for which they originally contended. But it was princi|pally de&s;igned to promote the completing of the new army, and to call out the inhabitants to the defence of Philadelphia. For the&s;e purpo&s;es they enumerat|ed the cau&s;es of the troubles, the grievances they had endured, the late oppre&s;&s;ive laws that had been pa&s;&s;ed again&s;t them; they in&s;i&s;ted much upon the contempt that had been thrown upon their petitions and appli|cations for redre&s;s of grievance; and to &s;hew that no alternative but war, or a tame &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion and re&s;igna|tion of all that could be dear to mankind; they a&s;&s;ert|ed, that even the boa&s;ted commi&s;&s;ioners for giving peace to America had not offered nor did yet of|fer, any terms but pardon upon ab&s;olute &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion.&mdash; From this detail and the&s;e premi&s;&s;es they deduced the nece&s;&s;ity of the act of independency, affirming that it would have been impo&s;&s;ible for them to have defend|ed their rights again&s;t &s;o powerful an agre&s;&s;or, aided by large armies of foreign mercenaries, or to have obtained that a&s;&s;i&s;tance from other &s;tates, which was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to their pre&s;ervation, whil&s;t they
<PB N="210" REF="214">acknowledged the &s;overeignty, and confe&s;&s;ed them&s;elves &s;ubjects of that power again&s;t which they had taken up arms, and were engaged in &s;o cruel a war. They &s;et forth the &s;ucce&s;s that had in general attended their cau&s;e and exertions, contending that the pre&s;ent &s;tate of weakne&s;s and danger did not proceed from any ac|tual lo&s;s or defeat, or from any defect of valour in their troops, but merely from the expiring of the terms of tho&s;e &s;hort enli&s;tments, which had in the be|ginning been adopted from an attention to the ea&s;e of the people. They a&s;&s;ured them that foreign &s;tates had already rendered them e&s;&s;ential &s;ervices, and had given them the mo&s;t po&s;itive a&s;&s;urances of further aid. And they excited the indignation of the people by ex|patiating upon the unrelenting, cruel, and inhuman manner in which the war was carried on, not only by the auxiliaries, but even by the Briti&s;h forces them|&s;elves. They in&s;i&s;ted, with an energy peculiar to men &s;en&s;ible of &s;o great an injury, upon the behaviour of the Briti&s;h men and officers, in murdering the defencele&s;s, plundering the innocent, ravi&s;hing women and de&s;troying infants. The colouring on this occa|&s;ion might po&s;&s;ibly be too &s;trong, but it has been al|lowed on all hands that there was too much rea&s;on for complaints of this kind. This odium fell fir&s;t up|on the He&s;&s;ians, and &s;ince that time has re&s;ted upon them, though the Briti&s;h troops were far from e&s;cap|ing a &s;hare of this imputation. The former being na|turally fierce, cruel, and ignorant of the rights of man|kind, were acquainted with no laws but tho&s;e of de&s;poti&s;m, and with no manners, except tho&s;e e&s;ta|bli&s;hed within the narrow confines of their own go|vernment, knew no di&s;tinction between ravaging and plundering an enemy's country, where no pre&s;ent ad|vantage
<PB N="211" REF="215">was intended, except booty nor any future benefit, except that of weakening the enemy, and the reducing a malcontent people to a due &s;en&s;e of obedi|ence to their &s;overeign.</P>
<P>It was &s;aid, to reconcile tho&s;e barbarians to &s;o new and &s;trange an adventure, &s;ome idea had been held out to them in Germany, that they &s;hould obtain large portions of lands which they were to conquer in Ame|rica; and that this notion, however ab&s;urd, had made them at fir&s;t con&s;ider the original po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors as their natural enemies; but when they di&s;covered their mi&s;|take, they con&s;idered the moveable plunder of the country not only as a matter of right but as an ade|quate recompence for undertaking &s;uch a voyage, and engaging in &s;uch a war. Perhaps this military rapine and plunder may be acccounted for without &s;uch adoption as this now mentioned. It was ob&s;erved from the beginning, the mo&s;t mortal antipathy &s;ub&s;i&s;ted be|tween the Americans and He&s;&s;ians: the former con|tending for freedom and filled with the highe&s;t notions of the natural rights of mankind, regarded with equal contempt and abhorrence a people whom they con&s;idered as the mo&s;t &s;ordid of all mercenary &s;laves, in re&s;igning all their faculties to the will and plea&s;ure of a petty de&s;pot, and becoming the ready in&s;truments of cruel tyranny. They reproached them with the highe&s;t degree of moral turpitude in thus engaging in a dome&s;tic quarrel, in which they had neither intere&s;t nor concern, and quitting their homes in the old world, to butcher a people in the new, from whom they had never received the &s;malle&s;t offence or injury; but who, on the contrary, had for a century pa&s;t, afforded a comfortable a&s;ylum to their harra&s;&s;ed and oppre&s;&s;ed countrymen, who had fled in multitudes thither
<PB N="212" REF="216">to e&s;cape from a tyranny &s;imilar to that under which they were now acting, and to enjoy the ble&s;&s;ings of a liberty mo&s;t generou&s;ly held out to them, of which the&s;e mercenaries would mo&s;t impiou&s;ly bereave the German as well as the Engli&s;h Americans. Such &s;en|timents and reproaches did not fail to encrea&s;e their natural ferocity and rapaciou&s;ne&s;s, and it is &s;aid that they continued in a cour&s;e of plundering until they became &s;o encumbered and loaded with &s;poil, and &s;o anxious for its pre&s;ervation, that it turned to be a great hin|drance to their military operations. It is a thing ob|vious to all who have con&s;idered human nature, and made ob&s;ervations upon the different characters of men in &s;ociety, that tho&s;e under de&s;potic governments are generally the mo&s;t ignorant and the mo&s;t cruel of mankind, and keene&s;t of plundering their enemies.&mdash; Men who are in&s;tructed in the rights of human nature, unle&s;s in the very heat of pa&s;&s;ion, will be ready to go|vern their behaviour by the laws of humanity, and &s;hudder at cruelty which perverts the fir&s;t principles of nature.</P>
<P>However much this conduct of the He&s;&s;ian troops might be contrary to the nature and di&s;po&s;ition of the Briti&s;h commanders, it was an evil not ea&s;ily to be re|medied. They were afraid to hazard the &s;ucce&s;s of the war in &s;o di&s;tant a &s;ituation, and &s;uch precarious and critical circum&s;tances, by quarrelling with auxila|ries who were nearly as numerous and powerful as their own forces. Allowances were nece&s;&s;ary, it was &s;aid, to be made for differences of manners, opinions, and even ideas of military rules and practice. Men mu&s;t make &s;ome apologies for errors which they them|&s;elves in &s;ome mea&s;ure pur&s;ue; and which, although they do not proceed in the &s;ame manner, in the end
<PB N="213" REF="217">come to the &s;ame conclu&s;ion. It will be impo&s;&s;ible, by any principles of moral rectitude, to vindicate ei|ther the practice of the warriors or the authors of the war.</P>
<P>General Howe had undoubtedly great difficulty to &s;upport that character which he and his family have long &s;u&s;tained, by acting according to his wi&s;hes in ma|naging parties on this occa&s;ion. It was next to impo&s;|&s;ible that the deva&s;tation and di&s;order practiced by the He&s;&s;ians &s;hould not operate upon the Briti&s;h troops.&mdash; It would have been difficult to puni&s;h tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions on the one &s;ide which were practi&s;ed without re&s;erve or reprehen&s;ion on the other. Every &s;ucce&s;sful devi|ation from order and di&s;cipline in war is generally &s;uc|ceeded by others &s;till greater. No relaxation can take place without the mo&s;t ruinous con&s;equences. The &s;oldier who at fir&s;t &s;hrinks at trifling exce&s;&s;es, will, in a &s;hort time, if they pa&s;s without reprehen&s;ion, pro|ceed without he&s;itation to the greate&s;t enormities.</P>
<P>From the&s;e cau&s;es above-mentioned aro&s;e the&s;e com|plaints of the Americans concerning the de&s;olation that was &s;pread over the Jer&s;ies, and which, by affecting friends and moderate people, as well as enemies, did great injury to the royal cau&s;e. The latter were thereby united more clo&s;ely, and urged to action, and the former were in great numbers detached from the royal cau&s;e. This effect was not confined to the imme|diate &s;ufferers; it extended through the colonies, where the accounts of the conduct of the army was publi&s;hed, and imbittered the minds of all the coloni&s;ts again&s;t the military and the cau&s;e they were &s;upport|ing. When the accounts of the barbarities of our army were tran&s;mitted to Europe, they greatly affect|ed our national character, e&s;pecially in France, where
<PB N="214" REF="218">the people in general through the whole cour&s;e of this conte&s;t have been &s;trongly on the &s;ide of the Ameri|cans. Among tho&s;e the reports were received gree|dily and as readily believed. There was one proceed|ing that was greatly cen&s;ured by all our neighbours, and ju&s;tly de&s;erved to be reprobated by all civilized nations;&mdash;that was the de&s;truction of the public libra|ry at Trenton, and of the college and library at Prince|town, together with a celebrated orrery, made by Rottenhou&s;e, &s;aid to be the be&s;t in the world. The&s;e were de&s;troyed by our army without remor&s;e or com|punction. It would appear that the Engli&s;h and German troops made war with literature it&s;elf; for the library at New York &s;eems to have met with the &s;ame fate, for a Gla&s;gow book&s;eller declared in pa&s;&s;ing through Newca&s;tle, that he purcha&s;ed a book in Gla&s;gow, which was part of the plunder of New York. In the mo&s;t Gothic times of barbarity it was &s;eldom known that places of learning, or tho&s;e public wor&s;hip were plundered by the fierce&s;t enemy. It was left to the pre|&s;ent poli&s;hed and polite age, and the pre&s;ent mild go|vernment, to make war with literature and the go&s;pel. To turn places of divine wor&s;hip into theatres or play|hou&s;es, or to reduce them to a&s;hes, was re&s;erved for tho&s;e heroes who acted under the au&s;pices of a mini|&s;ter who had once been di&s;graced for cowardice and di&s;obedience by the highe&s;t authority, and knew bet|ter to pu&s;h on others to dangerous exploits than ri&s;k his own life in the &s;malle&s;t degree. The invi&s;ible en|ergy of this cowardly influence, &s;eems to have pervad|ed the whole mea&s;ures of our army on this occa&s;ion, and pu&s;hed them on to practices which future ages will reflect upon with horror and a&s;toni&s;hment. The pre|&s;ident of the college of Princetown in New Jer&s;ey was
<PB N="215" REF="219">become peculiarly obnoxious to the friends of govern|ment: he had been called from North Britain to that appointment, and had for many years been con|&s;picuous for an attachment to liberty. The leading party in his own country, who were never his friends while he continued there, were the principal promot|ers of the American war in North Britain, and as he was well known to many in the army who were con|nected with that party and their friends, it was &s;up|po&s;ed that the de&s;pite &s;hewed to this college was prin|cipally aimed at the pre&s;ident. He was lately made a member of the continental congre&s;s which rendered him &s;till more con&s;picuous as well as obnoxious. A &s;ermon which he preached before the congre&s;s, tho' a very moderate and &s;en&s;ible di&s;cour&s;e, was &s;erved in Scotland in the &s;ame manner as the college over which he pre&s;ided was &s;erved in America. It was publi&s;h|ed in Edinburgh and Gla&s;gow with notes mo&s;t di&s;|re&s;pectful to the author and the cau&s;e which he was engaged in &s;upporting. The old enmity that was &s;hewn to him when in his own country, on this occa|&s;ion broke out with new violence, and that party which has long been &s;apping the foundations of the church of Scotland, &s;hewed an inclination by their at|tacks upon his character to aim a blow at the churches in America. In England their ob&s;ervations were laughed at, and in America de&s;pi&s;ed, but their inten|tions were thereby known, and their folly made ma|nife&s;t to all men.</P>
<P>In about a month after the taking of New York, the inhabitants of that i&s;land pre&s;ented a petition to Lord and General Howe, the commi&s;&s;ioners for re&s;tor|ing peace to the colonies, &s;igned by Daniel Hor&s;e|mander and Oliver de Lany, and 946 others, declaring
<PB N="216" REF="220">their allegiance, and their <HI>acknowledgment</HI> of the <HI>con|&s;titutional authority</HI> of Great Britain over the colonies, and praying that in con&s;equence of former declarations i&s;&s;ued by the commi&s;&s;ioners that the city and country might be re&s;tored to his Maje&s;ty's peace and protec|tion. This petition to the commi&s;&s;ioners was follow|ed by another to the &s;ame purpo&s;e, from the freehold|ers and inhabitants of Queen's county in Long I&s;land. It was ob&s;erved of the&s;e petitions, that the acknow|ledgment of the con&s;titutional &s;upremacy in one, and of the con&s;titutional authority in the other, was ve|ry guardedly expre&s;&s;ed, all mention of parliament and the great que&s;tion of unconditional &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion being left totally untouched.&mdash;It is al&s;o remarka|ble that though the inhabitants of New York I&s;land and Queen's county, be&s;ides rai&s;ing a con&s;iderable bo|dy of troops for the King's &s;ervice, and e&s;tabli&s;hing a &s;trong militia for the common defence, had given e|very other te&s;timony of loyalty which could be ex|pected or wi&s;hed, yet their petitions were not taken notice of, nor were they re&s;tored to tho&s;e rights which they expected in con&s;equence of the declarations, as well as of the late law for the appointment of com|mi&s;&s;ioners.</P>
<P>The doubtful and critical &s;ituation of Philadelphia, which by a night or two's fro&s;t would have been ex|po&s;ed to the Briti&s;h forces, obliged the congre&s;s, about the end of the year to remove to Baltimore Town, in Maryland. In this &s;tate of public danger, the Ameri|cans were not a little alarmed by &s;ome di&s;&s;entions in the congre&s;s. The declaration for independency, as was already mentioned, had met with much oppo&s;ition in Philadelphia, not only from the tories, but from many who in all matters had been among the mo&s;t forward
<PB N="217" REF="221">in oppo&s;ing the claim of the crown and parliament.&mdash; The carrying of the que&s;tion through the province by a great majority was far from le&s;&s;ening the bitterne&s;s of tho&s;e who oppo&s;ed it, among whom were mo&s;t of the quakers, who were a powerful body in that colo|ny. The di&s;contented in this affair, as is often the ca&s;e, forgetting their former profe&s;&s;ions and princi|ples, mingled their pa&s;&s;ions and re&s;entments with their pre&s;ent oppo&s;ition, and joined with tho&s;e they had formerly per&s;ecuted and de&s;pi&s;ed, again&s;t their friends, whereby a &s;trong and formidable oppo&s;ition was form|ed. This oppo&s;ition appears to have been formed of men who joined in oppo&s;ition to government at fir&s;t from principles of mere private intere&s;t, or had in the hurry of party been brought over to take a &s;ide, with|out con&s;idering well the con&s;equences. The&s;e were &s;omewhat like a party we have at home, who will ex|claim loudly again&s;t the mea&s;ures of the government, which appear to affect their own intere&s;t, but in the time of a general election, either for fear of &s;ome private lo&s;s, or for the &s;ake of a bribe will act diame|trically contrary to all their profe&s;&s;ions of public &s;pi|rit, and declared regard to the common weal.</P>
<P>In con&s;equence of this di&s;&s;ention, and ill &s;ucce&s;s of the provincial arms during a great part of the cam|paign, &s;ome who minded their own intere&s;t and &s;afety more than the common cau&s;e of the colonies, de&s;erted the congre&s;s, and fled to New York to the Briti&s;h commi&s;&s;ioners to claim the benefit of the general par|don that had been offered, expecting as matters then &s;tood to return &s;peedily home in triumph. Among the&s;e was Mr. Galloway, whom we &s;hall have occa|&s;ion to take notice of afterwards; the family of the Allens, and &s;ome other leading men in Penn&s;ylvania
<PB N="218" REF="222">and the Jer&s;ies. The&s;e were not &s;o trouble&s;ome to the coloni&s;ts as &s;ome others that kept their places, who were &s;o numerous that upon the approach of the King's forces to the Delaware, they prevented the or|der for fortifying Philadelphia from being carried in|to execution. This incon&s;i&s;tent and alarming opera|tion in the &s;eat of life and action obliged General Wa&s;hington to detach three regiments under the com|mand of Lord Sterling, effectually to quell the oppo|&s;ition of party, and to give energy to the mea&s;ure of fortifying the city. This decicive conduct an&s;wered all his purpo&s;es, except that of fortifying the city, a de&s;ign which &s;eems to have been given up as not prac|ticable, or probably not thought nece&s;&s;ary at this time.</P>
<P>The &s;ea&s;on of the year began now to turn &s;evere, though the fro&s;t was not &s;o &s;et in as to make a pa&s;|&s;age a-cro&s;s the Deleware; the King's troops found it nece&s;&s;ary to go into cantonments about the middle of December. Their cantonments formed an exten|&s;ive chain from Brun&s;wick on the Rariton to the De|laware, occupying not only the towns, po&s;ts and villa|ges, which came within the de&s;cription of the line, but tho&s;e al&s;o on the banks of the Delaware for &s;everal miles, &s;o that the latter compo&s;ed a front at the end of the line, which looked over to Philadelphia. The royal forces &s;eemed now to enjoy perfect tranquility, and there appeared no danger of their de&s;igns being interrupted, or of their &s;ecurity putting them in dan|ger. The Americans were in &s;uch a &s;ituation, as &s;eemed not to promi&s;e any thing in their favour, nor threat|en any mole&s;tation to their enemies. In this &s;tate of affairs a bold and intrepid enterprize was executed, which in its fir&s;t appearance &s;hewed more of brilliancy
<PB N="219" REF="223">than real energy, but in its con&s;equences changed in a great mea&s;ure the whole fortune of the war.</P>
<P>General Wa&s;hington, who had more through de|&s;ign than nece&s;&s;ity reduced his army to the &s;eemingly low &s;tate in which it then was, had u&s;ed all methods in his power to make the enemy believe in the pre&s;ent appearances, and had &s;ufficiently impre&s;&s;ed them with an idea of his impotency. On this account the King's forces, imagining there was now no danger, began to enjoy them&s;elves in their winter quarters, and lived in a &s;ecurity con&s;i&s;tent with their ideas of &s;afety. Colo|nel Rall, a brave and experienced officer, was &s;tation|ed with three battalions of He&s;&s;ians, a few Briti&s;h light hor&s;e, and fifty Cha&s;&s;eurs, making in all about fif|teen hundred, at Trenton on the Delaware, which was the highe&s;t po&s;t that the Briti&s;h troops occupied upon that river. Colonel Donop lay at Bordentown, a few miles lower down the river; a third body was &s;tationed at Burlington, within twenty miles of Phila|delphia. The troops at Trenton, as well as the other corps in the neighbouring cantonments, partly from an apprehen&s;ion of the weakne&s;s of the enemy, and part|ly from the contempt in which they held them, con&s;i|dered them&s;elves in as perfect a &s;tate of &s;ecurity, as if they had been performing garri&s;on duty in their own country, in a time of the profounde&s;t peace. This &s;uppo&s;ed &s;ecurity as is u&s;ual with military people, in|crea&s;ed the licentiou&s;ne&s;s and laxne&s;s of di&s;cipline, which has been already taken notice of, and produced an inattention to the po&s;&s;ibility of the &s;urpri&s;e, which upon no principles of military prudence can be ju&s;tifi|ed, in the neighbourhood of an enemy however weak and contemptible.</P>
<PB N="220" REF="224">
<P>General Wa&s;hington had partly fore&s;een what would happen, and made him&s;elf particularly ac|quainted with all the circum&s;tances of the troops in the&s;e cantonments, and as he perceived the danger that was intended for Philadelphia, thought it was now a proper occa&s;ion to prevent it, by giving his e|nemies a blow that they would &s;incerely feel. To per|form this de&s;ign, he re&s;olved to attack the Briti&s;h troops in their cantonments, by bringing his troops together in one point, and by making an attack upon them &s;eparately, make a bold pu&s;h to defeat them in their &s;eque&s;tered and &s;ecure &s;ituation. Should he hap|pen to &s;ucceed only in part of his plan, he was per&s;uad|ed he could make his enemies contract their conton|ments, and make them for&s;ake the vicinity of the ri|ter when they found that it was not a &s;ufficient guard to cover their quarters from in&s;ult and danger. By this means he would for the pre&s;ent &s;ecure Philadelphia, which was the principal object of his attention. For the&s;e purpo&s;es he took the nece&s;&s;ary mea&s;ures for a&s;|&s;embling his troops, which con&s;i&s;ted chiefly of drafts from the militia of Pen&s;ylvania and Virginia. The&s;e were to march in three divi&s;ions to an appointed &s;ta|tion on the Delaware as &s;oon as it was dark, and with as little noi&s;e as po&s;&s;ible. This was performed upon the evening of Chri&s;tmas. Two of the&s;e divi&s;ions were commanded by the Generals Erving and Cadwallader, the fir&s;t of which was to pa&s;s the river at Trenton-Ferry, about a mile below the town, and the other &s;till lower towards Bordentown. The principal corps was commanded by General Wa&s;hington in per&s;on, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the Generals Sullivan and Green, and con|&s;i&s;ted of about 2500 men, provided with a train of ten &s;mall bra&s;s field pieces. With this corps he arrived
<PB N="221" REF="225">at Mr Kenny's Ferry, at the time appointed, hoping before midnight to pa&s;s over that divi&s;ion, and the ar|tillery, and then it would be no difficulty to reach that place before daylight, and effectually to &s;urpri&s;e Colonel Rall's brigade. The pa&s;&s;age was however difficult; the river was &s;o encumbered with ice that it was with great labour that they could work the boats cro&s;s the river, which retarded their pa&s;&s;age &s;o much that it was near four o'clock before it was com|pleted. They were al&s;o hindered in their march by a violent &s;torm of &s;now and hail, which rendered the way &s;o &s;lippery, that it was with difficulty they reach|ed the place of their de&s;tination by eight o'clock.</P>
<P>The detachments were formed in two divi&s;ions im|mediately upon their landing, one of which turning to their right, took the lower road to Trenton; and the other, with General Wa&s;hington, proceeded along the upper road to Pennington. Notwith&s;tanding the de|lays and interruptions they met with, and the advan|ced &s;tate of day light, the He&s;&s;ians had no knowledge of their approach, until an advanced po&s;t at &s;ome di&s;|tance from the town was attacked by the upper divi|&s;ion; the lower divi&s;ion about the &s;ame time driving in the out grounds on their &s;ide.&mdash;The regiment of Rall having been detached to &s;upport the picquet which was fir&s;t attacked, was &s;oon put into di&s;order by the re|treat of that party, and obliged to rejoin the main bo|dy. Colonel Rall now bravely charged the enemy, but being &s;oon mortally wounded, the troops were thrown into di&s;order, after a &s;hort encounter, and dri|ven from their artillery, which con&s;i&s;ted of &s;ix bra&s;s field pieces. Thus overpowered and nearly &s;urround|ed, after an ineffectual attempt to retreat to Prince|town, the three regiments of Rall, Lo&s;sberg, and
<PB N="222" REF="226">Knyphau&s;en, were obliged to &s;urrender pri&s;oners of war. Some few of the Cha&s;&s;eurs, and &s;ome &s;tragglers made their e&s;cape along the river &s;ide to Bordentown. Several of the He&s;&s;ians that had been out plundering in the country and accordingly ab&s;ent from their duty that morning, took the &s;ame way of &s;aving them&s;elves, while their crime was concealed under the general misfortune.</P>
<P>The lo&s;s of the He&s;&s;ians in killed and wounded was very incon&s;iderable; their lo&s;s in this re&s;pect did not exceed forty at mo&s;t. The lo&s;s of the Americans was &s;till more incon&s;iderable. The pri&s;oners amounted to 918. Thus one part of General Wa&s;hington's plan was executed with &s;ucce&s;s; but the two others failed in the execution, the quantity of ice being &s;o great that the divi&s;ions under Erving and Cadwallader, found the river at the places they were to cro&s;s impa&s;&s;ible. Had not this happened, and that the fir&s;t according to his orders had been able to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Bridge over Trenton Creek, not one of tho&s;e that fled to Bor|dentown would have e&s;caped. Had the de&s;ign been executed in all its parts, and the three divi&s;ions had joined after the affair at Trenton, it &s;eems probable, that they would have &s;wept all the po&s;ts on the river before them.</P>
<P>In his pre&s;ent &s;ituation, General Wa&s;hington could not proceed farther in his plan of operation. The force he had with him was far from being able to maintain its ground at Trenton, there being a body of light infantry at Princetown, which was only a few miles di&s;tant, which by the junction of Donop's bri|gade, or other bodies from the neare&s;t cantonments, would have &s;oon &s;wallowed up his little army. He ac|cordingly repa&s;&s;ed the Delaware the &s;ame evening,
<PB N="223" REF="227">carrying with him the pri&s;oners, who with their artil|lery and colours, afforded a day of new and joyful tri|umph in Philadelphia. This &s;mall &s;ucce&s;s wonderful|ly rai&s;ed the &s;pirit of the coloni&s;ts. It is a &s;trange, but a general di&s;po&s;ition in mankind to be more afraid of tho&s;e they do not know, than of tho&s;e with whom they are acquainted. Difference of dre&s;s, of arms, complexion, beard, colour of the hair or eyes, with the general mein and countenance, have on various occa&s;ions had &s;urpri&s;ing effects, upon even brave and experienced &s;oldiers. The He&s;&s;ians had hitherto been very terrible to the Americans, and the taking a whole brigade of them pri&s;oners, appeared &s;o incredible at Philadelphia, that the very time they were marching to that city, people were contending in different parts that the whole &s;tory was a fiction, and that indeed it could not be true. The charm was however broken, and the He&s;&s;ians were no longer terrible. The&s;e invincible troops were found both to be vulnerable, and capable of being &s;ubdued; and the Americans found, that by &s;uitable exertions of their own &s;trength they were a match for the mo&s;t terrible of their ene|mies. From this time they began to under&s;tand their own importance, and made our men find their impre&s;|&s;ion more heavily than for &s;ome time before. This &s;o far turned the &s;cale of &s;ucce&s;s, that our troops ne|ver after that time gained an advantage that was of any real emolument to them.</P>
<P>General Wa&s;hington was now reinforced by &s;everal regiments from Virginia and Maryland, as well as with &s;everal new bodies of Pen&s;ylvania militia, who with tho&s;e of that province under his command, were much di&s;tingui&s;hed in the hard &s;ervice of the en&s;uing winter campaign. The &s;urpri&s;e at Trenton did not excite
<PB N="224" REF="228">le&s;s amazement in the Briti&s;h and auxiliary quarters than it did joy in tho&s;e of the Americans. That three old veteran regiments of a people that make war a profe&s;&s;ion, &s;hould lay down their arms to a ragged and untrained militia, and that with &s;carcely any lo&s;s on their &s;ide, &s;eemed an event of &s;o extraordinary a na|ture, that it gave full &s;cope to the operation of con|jecture, &s;u&s;picion, cen&s;ure, and malignity, as different per&s;ons were differently affected. General Howe was blamed for making &s;o exten&s;ive a chain of cantonments; Rall was blamed for marching out of the town to meet the enemy; and the He&s;&s;ians were blamed for cow|ardice in the opinion of their allies. General Howe was certainly led into this error by the deep &s;cheme which General Wa&s;hington had laid,&mdash;and he was catched in a &s;nare that very few per&s;ons could have e|&s;caped. The American General had &s;o exqui&s;itely counterfeited weakne&s;s, fear, and di&s;tre&s;s, that even his own friends had the &s;ame apprehen&s;ions that his enemies had concerning his &s;ituation. It was no won|der that General Howe imagined there was no danger from a General that appeared to have neither men, money, nor any pre&s;ent re&s;ources.&mdash;The friends of General Howe vindicated his character by alledging, that he not only depended upon the weakne&s;s of the enemy, but was influenced to make &s;uch cantonments to cover and protect Monmouth country, where a great number of the people were well-affected to govern|ment. It was added in his defence, that perhaps no line of cantonment or po&s;ts can be &s;o perfectly con|trived as not to admit of an impre&s;&s;ion, in &s;ome part, by a force much inferior to the aggregate power of the defen&s;ive. It upon the whole appears, that on this occa&s;ion General Howe was outwitted by General
<PB N="225" REF="229">Wa&s;hington. As to Colonel Rall, provid|ed the charge again&s;t him was ju&s;t, his mi&s;conduct proceeded from the &s;ame error which prevailed ge|nerally among both officers and men of the Briti&s;h as well as the He&s;&s;ian forces. From their &s;ucce&s;&s;es and &s;uperiority in the former campaign, which they per|ceived they had in every action, they held the colo|ni&s;ts in the utmo&s;t contempt, both as men and as &s;ol|diers; and were ready to attribute all their advanta|ges to their own per&s;onal bravery, which were in fact derived from a number of other occurrent circum&s;tances; from military &s;kill, experience, and di&s;cipline, from the &s;uperior excellency of their &s;mall arms, ar|tillery, and of all other engines, and &s;upplies nece&s;|&s;ary for war; and &s;till more particularly to a better &s;upply, and a more dexterous u&s;e of the bayonets, which gave them a great &s;uperiority over the Ameri|cans, who were but badly furni&s;hed with this kind of arms, and were not expert in the u&s;e of them.</P>
<P>The King's troops began now to perceive that they had more to do than &s;port them&s;elves in winter quar|ters. The alarm that was now &s;pread induced the Briti&s;h and auxiliary troops immediately to a&s;&s;emble, and General Grant, with the forces at Brun&s;wick to advance &s;peedily to Princetown, whil&s;t Lord Corn|wallis who was gone to New York in his way to Eng|land, found it nece&s;&s;ary to delay his voyage, and re|turn to the defence of the Jer&s;eys. They found that they were not now without an enemy to encounter, for General Wa&s;hington having received reinforcements, had again pa&s;&s;ed the Delaware, and was with his whole force at Trenton. Lord Cornwallis advanced pre&s;ently to attack him, and found him &s;trongly po&s;t|ed at the back of Trenton Creek, and in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of
<PB N="226" REF="230">the Bridge and other pa&s;&s;ages which were well co|vered and defended by artillery. After a few &s;kir|mi&s;hes, a canonade en&s;ued, which continued until night; the Briti&s;h forces on this occa&s;ion were oblig|ed to proceed with con&s;iderable caution, and the re|membrance of the fate of the He&s;&s;ians made our of|ficers more cautious than on &s;ome former occa&s;ion. A brigade of the Briti&s;h troops lay that night at Maidenhead, &s;ix miles from Trenton, and another up|on its march from Brun&s;wick, con&s;i&s;ting of the 17th, the 40th, and 55th regiments under the command of Lieutenant colonel Mawhood, were at Princetown about the fame di&s;tance from Maidenhead. This be|ing the &s;ituation of both &s;ides, General Wa&s;hington, who was far from intending to hazard a battle hav|ing u&s;ed the nece&s;&s;ary precautions of keeping up the patroles and every other appearance of remaining in his camp, and leaving &s;mall parties to go the rounds and guard the bridge and the fords, he withdrew the re&s;t of his forces in the dead of the night, with the mo&s;t profound &s;ilence. They marched with &s;uch ex|pedition to Princetown, that &s;uppo&s;e they took a large compa&s;s by Allen&s;town partly to avoid Trenton, or A&s;&s;umpink Creek, and partly to avoid the brigade which lay at Maidenhead, their van fell in at &s;urpri&s;e next morning, with Colonel Mawhood, who had ju&s;t begun his march. Mawhood, not having the &s;mall|e&s;t idea of their force, being prevented by the fog|gine&s;s of the morning and other circum&s;tances from &s;eeing its extent, con&s;idered it only as an attempt of &s;ome flying party to interrupt his march, and having di&s;per&s;ed tho&s;e by whom he was fir&s;t attack|ed, pu&s;hed forwards without further apprehen&s;ions. But in a &s;hort time he found that not only the 17th
<PB N="227" REF="231">regiment which he led was attacked on all &s;ides by a &s;uperior force, but that it was al&s;o &s;eparated and cut of from the re&s;t of the brigade, while he di&s;co|vered by the continual di&s;tant firing, that the 55th, which followed was not in better circum&s;tances.</P>
<P>In this dangerous &s;ituation, Colonel Mawhood &s;hewed much bravery, and his regiment behaved with great firmne&s;s. After a violent engagement, and the greate&s;t exertions of courage and di&s;cipline, they at length forced their way through the enemy with their bayonets, and pur&s;ued their march to Maidenhead. The 55th was &s;everely pre&s;&s;ed, and finding it impo&s;&s;i|ble to pur&s;ue their march, retreated and returned by Hill&s;borough to Brun&s;wick. The 40th regiment, which was &s;till at Princetown when the action begun, &s;uffered le&s;s than the others, and retreated by ano|ther road to the &s;ame place. The coloni&s;ts confe&s;&s;ed the bravery of Colonel Mawhood and the 17th regi|ment, and declared that nothing could exceed their valour and intrepedity. The accounts of the killed and wounded on this occa&s;ion are &s;o differently repre|&s;ented that it is not ea&s;y to extract the truth with cer|tainty from &s;o many various repre&s;entations. Our accounts &s;ay that the number of killed, con&s;idering the warmth of the engagement, was not &s;o con&s;idera|ble as might have been expected; it is however al|lowed that 200 of the&s;e three regiments were taken pri&s;oners, and the killed were &s;omewhat fewer. The lo&s;s of the Americans was &s;aid to be much greater, e&s;pecially in killed, though from their own accounts we are informed that even in &s;lain the number of their men was inferior to ours. They lo&s;t Major-General Mercer belonging to Virginia, who was much e&s;teem|ed and lamented. Some have endeavoured to account
<PB N="228" REF="232">for a phenomenon in this la&s;t war, which has always at home been repre&s;ented as a fact, that there were always more of the coloni&s;ts killed in every action than there were of the King's troops. The manner of accounting for this di&s;parity in the &s;lain is, that the arms of the coloni&s;ts were not &s;o good, nor did they know how to u&s;e them &s;o well, as the King's forces; that in loading their pieces in the hurry of action they did not take time to charge properly.&mdash; This is a defect common to both &s;ides, and if a piece is not properly charged, the goodne&s;s of it will pro|duce little effect; all the effect proceeding from a good firelock depends upon the charging of it. The &s;oldiers in our regiments were not all veterans more than the Americans; and a young recruit new come to a regiment, though he knows &s;omething of the ex|erci&s;e, will be ju&s;t as raw in the day of battle as a mi|litiaman or a coloni&s;t, and be in as great a hurry in loading his piece.</P>
<P>This phenomenon is re&s;olved by the Americans by denying the fact, and a&s;&s;erting on the other hand that in all engagements upon equal ground and equal ad|vantages, the difference of killed and wounded on each &s;ide was very nearly equal. Whatever there may be in this di&s;pute, one thing is certain, that the coloni&s;ts had the better in this engagement.</P>
<P>This &s;pirited and unexpected movement of Wa&s;hing|ton, with its animated con&s;equences, recalled Lord Cornwallis from the Delaware, who was not without apprehen&s;ion for the &s;aftety of the troops and the magazines at Brun&s;wick. The Americans &s;till avoid|ing a general action, and &s;atisfied with the pre&s;ent advantages, cro&s;&s;ed the Mile&s;tone River, without any further attempt. In a few weeks however they overrun
<PB N="229" REF="233">Ea&s;t Jer&s;ey as well as the We&s;t, &s;preading them&s;elves over the Rariton, even unto E&s;&s;ex county, whereby &s;eizing Newark, Elizabeth-town and Woodbridge, they became ma&s;ters of the coa&s;t oppo&s;ite to Staten I&s;land. They took their principal po&s;ts with &s;o much judgment, that it was not practicable to di&s;lodge them. The King's army retained only the two po&s;ts of Brun&s;|wick and Amboy, the one &s;ituated a few miles up the Rariton, the other on a point of land at its mouth, and both holding an open communication with New York by &s;ea. Thus by a few well-concerted and &s;pi|rited actions was Philadelphia &s;aved, Penn&s;ylvania freed from danger, the Jer&s;eys clearly recovered, and a victorious and far &s;uperior army reduced to act up|on the defen&s;ive, and for &s;everal months re&s;trained within very narrow and inconvenient limits. The&s;e actions, and the rai&s;ing him&s;elf from the &s;eemingly lowe&s;t &s;tate of di&s;tre&s;s in which he appeared to be in, exalted the character of General Wa&s;hington as a commander very high, both in Europe and America: and with his proceedings and &s;ub&s;equent conduct &s;erved all together to give &s;anction to that appellation which is now generally applied to him, of the Ameri|can Fabius. The&s;e events cannot be attributed to any mi&s;conduct in the Briti&s;h officers and the men whom they commanded, but depended entirely upon the happy application of a number of powerful and con|curring circum&s;tances, which were far beyond their reach to controul. Many of the&s;e things which now happened had been fore&s;een and foretold from the beginning, both by tho&s;e who oppo&s;ed publicly or regretted in private this war, and as others are obvi|ous to all men, it may not be improper to mention &s;ome of tho&s;e cau&s;es that clogged it with particular difficulties.</P>
<PB N="230" REF="234">
<P>The principal of the&s;e were, the va&s;t extent of that continent, with its unu&s;ual di&s;tribution into great tracts of cultivated and wild territory, the long extent of &s;ea coa&s;t in its front, and the boundle&s;s wa&s;tes at the back of the inhabited countries, afforded re&s;ource or &s;helter in all circum&s;tances; the numberle&s;s inac|ce&s;&s;able po&s;ts and &s;trong natural barriers formed by the various combinations of woods, mountains, rivers, lakes, and mar&s;hes. All the&s;e properties and circum|&s;tances, with others apertaining to the climate and &s;ea&s;ons, may be &s;aid to fight the battles of the inha|bitants in a defen&s;ive war. To the&s;e may be added, others le&s;s local.&mdash;The unexpected union and un|known &s;trength of the colonies, the judicious appli|cation of that &s;trength by &s;uiting the defence to the nature, genius, and abilities of the inhabitants, as well as to the natural advantages of the country, thereby rendering it a war of po&s;ts, &s;urprizes, and &s;kirmi&s;hes, in&s;tead of a war of battles. To all the&s;e may be ad|ded, the people were not bridled by &s;trong cities, nor fettered by luxury in tho&s;e that were otherwi&s;e, &s;o that the reduction of a capital had no effects up|on the re&s;t of the provinces, and the army could re|tain no more territory than what it occupied, which was again lo&s;t as &s;oon as it departed to another quar|ter.</P>
<P>The army under Lord Cornwallis was now &s;adly &s;traitened; during the remaining part of the winter, and the whole &s;pring, while they continued at Brun&s;|wick and Amboy, they underwent a &s;evere and un|remitted duty, whil&s;t their ranks were continually thinned by a continued &s;eries of &s;kirmi&s;hes, which were productive of no rival advantages on either &s;ide, except that they inured the coloni&s;ts to military
<PB N="231" REF="235">&s;ervice. Now every load of forage that was procur|ed, and every article of provi&s;ion which did not come from New York, was fought for and purcha&s;ed at the expence of blood.</P>
<P>The con&s;equences of the late military outrages in the Jer&s;eys were now &s;everely felt in the pre&s;ent change of circum&s;tances. As &s;oon as fortune turned, and the means were in their power, the &s;ufferers of all parties, the well-di&s;po&s;ed to the royal cau&s;e, as well as the neutrals and waverings, now ro&s;e as one man, to avenge their per&s;onal injuries and particular op|pre&s;&s;ion, and being pu&s;hed on by a keener &s;pur than any which a public cau&s;e or general motive could have excited, became its bittere&s;t and mo&s;t determined e|nemies. Thus the whole country, with a few excep|tions, became ho&s;tile: Tho&s;e who were incapable of arms, acting as &s;pies, and keeping a continual watch for tho&s;e who bore them, &s;o that the &s;malle&s;t mo|tion could not be made, without its being expo&s;ed and di&s;covered, before it could produce the effects for which its was intended. Such were the froward events that during the winter damped the hopes of a victorious army, and nipt the laurels of the forego|ing pro&s;perous campaign. Con&s;idering the behavi|our of our army, it was a ju&s;t act of providence which befel them, and the Americans were &s;ufficiently vin|dicated in ju&s;tice for the pre&s;ent retaliations.</P>
<P>It has been formerly taken notice of, that &s;everal attempts had been made to call off the attention of the &s;outhern colonies from the general alliance to their own immediate defence by involving them effectually in civil war and dome&s;tic contention, either through the means of the well-affected in general, the Regu|lators and Highland emigrants in the Carolinas, or
<PB N="232" REF="236">of the negroes in Virginia. The charges which the in&s;urgents brought again&s;t their governors have al&s;o been taken notice of, namely of endeavouring to bring the &s;avages down again&s;t them, the people to promote their de&s;igns of tyranny and de&s;poti&s;m. The di&s;ap|pointment in the&s;e attempts did not damp the zeal of the Briti&s;h agents among the Indian nations, nor ren|der them hopele&s;s of &s;till performing &s;ome e&s;&s;ential &s;ervice by engaging the&s;e people to make a diver&s;ion, and to attack the &s;outhern colonies in their back and defencele&s;s parts. The Indians are in general fickle in their faith, greedy of pre&s;ents, and eager for &s;poil, and it is not difficult to work &s;o upon the&s;e pa&s;&s;ions as to engage them in the mo&s;t de&s;perate and inhuman enterprizes. By a proper application of pre&s;ents they may be per&s;uaded to break treaties which they have lately made, or to pur&s;ue the mo&s;t ba&s;e de&s;igns again&s;t tho&s;e with whom they appear to be in the &s;tricte&s;t friend&s;hip.</P>
<P>The agents on this occa&s;ion u&s;ed all the methods which were in their power to bring over tho&s;e &s;ava|ges to their own &s;avage purpo&s;es and de&s;igns. They held out to them that a Briti&s;h army was to land in We&s;t Florida, and after penetrating the creeks Chick|e&s;aw and Cherokee countries, and being joined by the warriors of tho&s;e nations, they were to invade the Carolinas and Virginia, whil&s;t another formidable force by &s;ea and land was to make a powerful im|pre&s;&s;ion on the coa&s;ts. Circular letters were &s;ent to the &s;ame import to Mr Stuart the principal agent for Indian affairs, to the inhabitants of the back &s;ettle|ments, requiring all the well-affected as well as all tho&s;e who were willing to pre&s;erve them&s;elves and their families from the ineveitable calamaties and de|&s;truction
<PB N="233" REF="237">of an Indian war, to be in readine&s;s to re|pair to the royal &s;tandard, as &s;oon as it was erected in the Cherokee country, and to bring with them their hor&s;es, cattle, and provi&s;ions, for all which they were promi&s;ed payment. They were likewi&s;e required for their pre&s;ent &s;ecurity and future di&s;tinction from the King's enemies, to &s;ub&s;cribe immediately to a paper, declaratory of their allegiance. This &s;cheme was &s;o plau&s;ible that it &s;eemed to operate wonderfully upon the minds of the Indians, and to have prepared them in a great mea&s;ure for a general confederacy again&s;t the colonies. Even the &s;ix nations who had before agreed to a &s;trict neutrality, now began to commit &s;e|veral &s;mall ho&s;tilities, which were afterwards di&s;avow|ed by their elders and chiefs. The Creek Indians, more violent, began the &s;outhern war with all their u&s;ual barbarity, until finding that the expected &s;uc|cours did not arrive, they with a fore&s;ight uncommon among Indians, &s;topt &s;uddenly &s;hort, and repenting of what they had done, were in the pre&s;ent &s;tate of affairs ea&s;ily excu&s;ed: and being afterwards applied to for a&s;&s;i&s;tance by the Cherokees, returned for an|&s;wer, that they, the latter, had plucked the thorn out of their foot, and were welcome to keep it.</P>
<P>The Cherokees however fell upon the adjoining colonies with determined fury, carrying for a part of the &s;ummer ruin and de&s;truction wherever they came, &s;calping and &s;laughtering the people, and totally de&s;troying their &s;ettlements. They were &s;oon however checked, and &s;everely experienced, that things were much altered &s;ince the time of their for|mer warfare upon the &s;ame ground, and that the martial &s;pirit now prevalent in the colonies was ex|tended to their remote&s;t frontiers. They were not
<PB N="234" REF="238">only repul&s;ed and defeated in every action by the neigh|bouring militia of Virginia and Carolina, but pur&s;ued into their own country, where their towns were de|moli&s;hed, their corn de&s;troyed, and their warriors thinned in repeated engagements, until the nation was nearly extirminated, and the wretched &s;urvivors were obliged to &s;ubmit to any terms pre&s;cribed by the vic|tors, whil&s;t the neighbouring nations were &s;ilent &s;pec|tators of their calamities. The Indian war was not more fortunate with re&s;pect to its effects on the friends of government in tho&s;e quarters, who are &s;aid to a man to have expre&s;&s;ed the utmo&s;t aver&s;ion to the au|thors, and abhorrence of the cruelty of that mea&s;ure, and that &s;ome of the chief leaders of the tories avow|ed a recantation of their former principles, merely on that account. It was in the mid$$ of the bu&s;tle and danger of war, and when the &s;cale of fortune &s;eemed to preponderate again&s;t the coloni&s;ts, by the defeat on Long I&s;land and the reduction of New York, at a time when a great and invincible force by &s;ea and land, carried ruin and conque&s;t wherever it directed its cour&s;e, that all the members of the congre&s;s ven|tured to &s;ign that remarkable treaty of perpetual compact and union between the thirteen revolted co|lonies. As we have &s;een this treaty at large in ano|ther part, we &s;hall now pa&s;s over it without &s;aying any more concerning it.</P>
<P>As the political debates of this year and the pro|ceeding in parliament, are exceeedingly long and diffu|&s;ive, an account of them in this place, though they naturally fall in, would di&s;unite the hi&s;tory and the progre&s;s of the war; they &s;hall therefore be added at the conclu&s;ion of the hi&s;tory of this year.</P>
<PB N="235" REF="239">
<P>We have already given an account of the &s;ituation of the armies in America during the winter and great|er part of the &s;pring. As the &s;ea&s;on opened and en|larged the field of enterprize, the Briti&s;h commanders &s;eized the advantages and opportunities which their naval &s;uperiority pre&s;ented to them in a country deep|ly inter&s;ected with navigable rivers, and continually laid open in other parts by the numberle&s;s inlets and channels which the peculiar con&s;truction of the i&s;lands and coa&s;ts admit in their connection with the ocean and tho&s;e rivers. In the mean time, a con&s;iderable body of provincial troops was formed under the di|rection of-Sir William Howe, which in proce&s;s of time amounted to &s;everal thou&s;ands, and which under that denomination included not only Americans but Briti&s;h and Iri&s;h refugees from the di&s;terent parts of the continent. The officers of this body were gen|tlemen, who for their attachment to the royal cau&s;e had been obliged to for&s;ake their re&s;pective provin|ces, or tho&s;e who lived under that protection in the New York I&s;lands. The&s;e new troops were for the time of their &s;ervice placed upon the &s;ame footing as to pay, &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, and cloathing with the e&s;tabli&s;h|ed national bodies of the royal army: With this ad|vantage to the private men and non-commi&s;&s;ioned of|ficers, that they were entitled to con&s;iderable allot|ments of lands at the end of the troubles. This mea|&s;ure, be&s;ides its utility in point of &s;trength, afforded &s;ome pre&s;ent provi&s;ion to tho&s;e, who having lo&s;t eve|ry thing in this unhappy conte&s;t, were now thrown upon the crown, as their only refuge and &s;upport, whil&s;t on the other &s;ide, in&s;tead of their being an heavy and unprofitable burden to the crown, they were placed in a condition which enabled them to become
<PB N="236" REF="240">active and u&s;eful in&s;truments in effecting its purpo&s;es. At the &s;ame time, this addition of &s;trength derived from and growing in the country, carried a very flat|tering appearance, and &s;eemed to indicate re&s;ources for carrying on the war in the very &s;cene of action. This was a deception which government continually indulged, and to which they have always been dupes. Tho&s;e emigrants and tories, the greate&s;t of which had fled from di&s;tant parts with their families and with what they could carry with them, were much in the &s;ame &s;ituation with the army; they had no re&s;i|dence till the war was over, and could only for once recruit the troops. There were but few of them that were in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of property, and during the time of the war could be of no more &s;ervice than com|mon recruits; and provided the war &s;hould end &s;uc|ce&s;sfully, could be of no more &s;ervice than any others who &s;hould choo&s;e to &s;ettle in the country. Even in tho&s;e parts that were con&s;idered loyal, it was only the pre&s;ence of the army that made them &s;o, and it was nece&s;&s;ity, and not principle, that drove them to the royal &s;tandard.</P>
<P>Governor Tryon was placed at the head of this new corps, who already in his civil capacity com|manded the militia, and who had been at much pains in e&s;tabli&s;hing it for the &s;upport of the royal cau&s;e.&mdash; He now bore the rank of a Major-general of the pro|vincials. This junction of a few tory provincials with the royal army, was con&s;idered at home as a wonder|ful acqui&s;ition. The friends of the mini&s;try began to boa&s;t that the Americans were all coming over to the King's forces, and that there were as many on the &s;ide of government as there were on the &s;ide of the congre&s;s. This fooli&s;h and indeed fal&s;e ga&s;conade ex|po&s;ed
<PB N="237" REF="241">the friends of government very much; for it appeared exceedingly my&s;tical that &s;eeing there were &s;o many of the Americans on the &s;ide of the royal cau&s;e, that there &s;hould be occa&s;ion every year for new recruits to the army, and new large &s;ums of mo|ney for carrying on the war. Fal&s;ehood and incon|&s;tancy are in&s;eparably connected.</P>
<P>General Howe having found by experience that the coloni&s;ts were not to be &s;o ea&s;ily conquered as he imagined, formed a plan of de&s;troying their &s;tores and magazines in all tho&s;e places where he could reach them by the aid and a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the &s;hipping. He was informed that they gathered con&s;iderable &s;tores and magazines at a place called Peeks-Kill, which lies about 50 miles up the North River from New-York, which &s;erved as a kind of port to Courtland manor, by which it had received provi&s;ions, and di&s;pen&s;ed &s;upplies. The Americans during the win|ter had built and erected mills, as well as e&s;tabli&s;hed magazines, in a rough and mountaneous tract called Courtland manor. This was a grand repo&s;itory, and a place of great &s;ecurity; upon this they had be|&s;towed much pains and expence, and furni&s;hed it with immen&s;e &s;tores and provi&s;ions of all &s;orts.</P>
<P>Sir William Howe was informed of the&s;e circum|&s;tances in general, and was convinced of the con&s;e|quences which would en&s;ue, provided the&s;e re&s;ources which the enemy had provided with &s;o much labour and indu&s;try were cut off. He knew that a general atttempt upon Courtland-manor would not only be dangerous on account of the &s;trength of the county, but impracticable from the nature of the ground, and mu&s;t prove abortive; as the length, parade, and the manner of preparation, would afford the coloni&s;ts
<PB N="238" REF="242">time for preparation, and warn them of his de&s;ign; &s;o that the force in that quarter would be gathered again&s;t him, and he would have to fight every inch of his way, under a moral certainty of lo&s;s, without any pro&s;pect of &s;ucceeding. And &s;uppo&s;e he &s;hould even be able to defeat their troops, they would have time to carry away the magazines to another place.</P>
<P>Peek's-kill was however within reach, and the Ge|neral determined to profit by that circum&s;tance.&mdash; Colonel Bird, with 500 men, under the protection of a frigate of war, and other armed ve&s;&s;els, was &s;ent up the North River for that purpo&s;e. They &s;et out upon this expedition upon the third of March and reached the place before the alarm was given to the country. Upon their approach, the provincials, either finding or imagining them&s;elves unequal to the defence of the place, and being convinced that they had not time to remove any thing but them&s;elves and their arms, &s;et fire to the barracks and principal &s;tore-hou&s;es, and then retreated to a &s;trong pa&s;s about two miles di&s;tance, which commanded the entrance into the mountains, and covered a road which led to the mills and other &s;tores. The Briti&s;h troops found upon their landing that the provincials had left them little to do, and that they could not carry away what &s;till remained for want of time, compleated the con|flagration, and had the honour of burning tho&s;e &s;tores which had e&s;caped the flames of the provincials.&mdash; The troops re-imbarked, when the &s;ervice was per|formed, and the armament, after de&s;troying &s;everal &s;mall craft laden with provi&s;ions, returned.</P>
<P>This &s;ervice however was far from fulfilling the main de&s;ign of General Howe. Tho&s;e magazines were not of &s;o much importance and magnitude as
<PB N="239" REF="243">had been repre&s;ented, and &s;omething was &s;till to be done to di&s;tre&s;s the enemy, and to weaken their re|&s;ources. He had received intelligence that large quantities of &s;tores and provi&s;ions were depo&s;ited in the town of Danbury, and other places in the borders of Connecticut, which lay contigious to Courtland ma|nor. An expedition was accordingly undertaken for the de&s;truction of the&s;e magazines, the charge of which was committed to Governor Tryon, who was a&s;&s;i&s;ted by General Agnew, and Sir William F$r&s;kine. This expedition was &s;aid to have been formed upon a plan of General Tryon, who had &s;tattered him&s;elf with finding many provincials in that quarter to join him as &s;oon as he &s;hould appear at the head of the King's troops. This new General found him&s;elf un|der a very grievous mi&s;take. The detachment ap|pointed to this &s;ervice con&s;i&s;ted of 2000 men, who having embarked under the convoy of a proper naval armament, were landed in Norwalk in Connecticut, upon April 25th, about twenty miles to the &s;outhward of Danbury. As the country was no way prepared for &s;uch a vi&s;it, having no apprehen&s;ion of &s;uch a de|&s;ign, the troops advanced without interruption, and arrived at Danbury the following day. They now perceived that the country was ri&s;ing, not to join Ge|neral Tryon's &s;tandard as he imagined, but to inter|cept his retreat, and as no carriages could have been procured, if it had been otherwi&s;e, to bring off the &s;tores and provi&s;ions, they immediately proceeded to the de&s;truction of the provi&s;ions and magazine. In the execution of this &s;ervice the town was reduced to a&s;hes. This has been a method of carrying on war in which our army has been exceedingly &s;ucce&s;s|ful; from whence it would appear that they con&s;i|dered
<PB N="240" REF="244">the country as no longer belonging to the King but totally an enemy's country, which was to be wholly laid wa&s;te. Tryon and his detachment found this expedition attended with more difficulties than he fore&s;aw or was aware of; he did not expect that in that colony, where he promi&s;ed him&s;elf &s;o ma|ny friends, that he would meet with &s;uch re&s;i&s;t|ance as happened to him in his return. This de|tachment returned on the twenty-&s;eventh by the way of Kingsfield, without any fear that they would meet with any violent a&s;&s;ault from the people of Con|necticut. In the mean time the Generals Woo&s;ter, Arnold, and Sullvian, having collected as many of the militia as they could upon &s;o &s;udden an emergen|cy, marched with all expedition to cut off their re|treat, or to interrupt their march, till a larger body of forces could be collected. Woo&s;ter hung upon the rear of the detachment, whil&s;t Arnold, by cro&s;&s;ing the country, gained their front in order to di&s;pute their pa&s;&s;age through Kingsfield. Nor could the formidable appearance of the Briti&s;h forces, who had covering parties well furni&s;hed with field pieces on their flank and rear, nor the tumultuary manner in which a militia not very numerous were got together, pre|vent the Americans upon every advantageous ground from making bold attempts to interrupt the progre&s;s of the King's army. In one of the&s;e &s;kir|mi&s;hes General Woo&s;ter was mortally wounded. He was a brave and experienced officer, and had &s;erved with reputation in the two former wars; when he was verging upon the &s;eventieth year of his age, he fell nobly and bravely &s;upporting the liberties of his country, again&s;t a power which he con&s;idered de&s;po|tical, and which wanted to en&s;lave America. He di|ed

<PB N="241" REF="246">with the &s;ame re&s;olution that he had lived, and was much lamented by his friends. The royal forces had &s;carcely got clear of Woo&s;ter when they found them&s;elves engaged with Arnold. who had gotten po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Ridgefield, and with le&s;s than an hour's advantage of time had already thrown up an en|trenchment to cover his front. The troops however forced the village, and drove back the coloni&s;ts, who made a &s;tout re&s;i&s;tance, con&s;idering the &s;mallne&s;s of their number and the hurry in which they had been brought together. The action was &s;harp, and Ar|nold di&s;played his u&s;ual intrepedity. His hor&s;e hav|ing been &s;hot within a few yards of our foremo&s;t ranks he &s;uddenly di&s;entangled him&s;elf, and drawing out a pi&s;tol, &s;hot the &s;oldier dead, who was running up to transfix him with a bayonet. Our men on this occa|&s;ion had but little to boa&s;t of, for upon equal grounds and advantages Arnold's men were fully their match. General Tryon found none of tho&s;e loyal Americans he hoped for on this expedition. He lay all night at Ridgefield, and renewed his march on the 28th.&mdash; The next day was not more au&s;picious than the for|mer to our new General. The Americans were re|inforced with troops and cannon, and harra&s;&s;ed our army greatly during this day's march. Every advan|tageous po&s;t was &s;eized and di&s;puted, whil&s;t hovering parties on the flanks and rear endeavoured to di&s;turb the order of the march, and to profit of every difficul|ty of ground. The army at length gained the hill of camps within cannon &s;hot of their &s;hips, which afford|ed the be&s;t pro&s;pect they had met with &s;ince they left them. It was now evening, and their ammunition was exhau&s;ted, although it is reported that they had been &s;upplied with &s;ixty rounds a man, at their &s;etting
<PB N="242" REF="247">out upon this expedition. The forces immediately form|ed upon the high ground, where the enemy &s;eemed more determined and re&s;olute in their attack than they had been hitherto. In this &s;ituation, the General order|ed the troops to advance, and to charge with the bay|onets. It was now the la&s;t pu&s;h they were obliged either to make their way to the &s;hips through the enemy, or yield the day. They boldly broke through the provincial lines, and every thing being prepared for their reception, they embarked without further mole&s;tation.</P>
<P>In this expedition our men de&s;troyed large quanti|ties of corn, flower, and &s;alt provi&s;ions; a number of tents, with various military &s;tores and nece&s;&s;aries.&mdash; The lo&s;s of men on the King's &s;ide, according to our accounts, was very incon&s;iderable; this was the u&s;ual &s;tile on the&s;e occa&s;ions. The killed, wounded, and mi&s;&s;ing, amounted only to 172, of whom more than two-thirds were wounded. The general lo&s;s, ac|cording to all our accounts, on the &s;ide of the Ameri|cans was more than double, and the number of the &s;lain about four to one. The Americans gave a ve|ry different account of the&s;e actions, and rate our lo&s;s as high as their own. Perhaps &s;ome allowances are to be made on both &s;ides in giving an account of tho&s;e tran&s;actions. It is plain to any impartial per&s;on who reads our own accounts of this expedition, that our men were hard pre&s;&s;ed, and exceedingly glad to reach their &s;hips, and that they never dur&s;t attempt to look for either &s;tores or provi&s;ions, after they knew that the country began to ri&s;e; and if the impre&s;&s;ion of the Americans had been &s;o feeble as for near two days only to kill and wound 172 men out of two thou|&s;and, they might have ea&s;ily been driven back, di&s;|per&s;ed,
<PB N="243" REF="248">and totally routed; and the army having pur|&s;ued its march without &s;o much mole&s;tation as it met with during the whole retreat. The enemy kept clo&s;e upon them till they were under cover of their &s;hips, which appears to have been the only thing that &s;aved them from being totally de&s;troyed or taken pri|&s;oners. On the &s;ide of our troops there were no officers, it is &s;aid, killed. The Americans, be&s;ides old General Woo&s;ter, lo&s;t &s;everal gentlemen, three colonels, and Doctor Atwater, a gentleman of con&s;i|deration in that country. The number of officers that happened to be in the&s;e &s;kirmi&s;hes were out of all proportion to the number of men. The rawne&s;s of the militia, together with their weakne&s;s in point of number, obliged all the officers in that part of the country, as well as gentlemen, to act the part of com|mon &s;oldiers and u&s;e the mo&s;t uncommon exertions, as well as to expo&s;e them&s;elves in an extraordinary degree. This may account for the number of men of rank in their &s;ervice who fell on their &s;ide. Up|on the whole effect, this expedition did not an&s;wer the expectation upon which it was founded. The &s;tores at Danbury were far from being what they were repre&s;ented to have been; and though much mi&s;chief was done, it was doubtful whether the lo&s;s and the ri&s;k that was run on the one &s;ide was equiva|lent to the lo&s;s &s;u&s;tained on the other. The&s;e &s;ecret expeditions had as yet come much &s;hort of General Howe's expectations, and General Tryon was &s;adly di&s;appointed in his hopes of finding a loyal reinforce|ment in Connecticut.</P>
<P>It was not long till the people of Connecticut made a very &s;uitable retaliation, by paying a vi&s;it to Long I&s;land. Having been informed that commi&s;&s;aries had
<PB N="244" REF="249">for &s;ome time been employed in the ea&s;t end of Long I&s;land, in procuring forage, grain, and other nece&s;&s;a|ries for the Briti&s;h forces, and that the&s;e articles had been depo&s;ited for embarkation, at a little port called Sagg Harbour; the di&s;tance of that place from New York, and the weakne&s;s of the protection, which con&s;i&s;ted only of one company of foot, and an armed &s;chooner of twelve guns, afforded encouragement for fru&s;trating that &s;cheme of &s;upplying the wants of the army. The chief difficulty lay in pa&s;&s;ing and repa&s;&s;ing of the found, which was continually traver&s;ed by the Briti&s;h cruizers. This difficulty was however &s;ur|mounted, and the expedition put into execution.&mdash; Colonel Meigs, a daring and enterprizing officer, who had attended Arnold in the Canada expedition, and to whom danger as well as fatigue was become fami|liar. He had been taken pri&s;oner in the attempt to &s;torm the city of Quebec, and was now the conductor of this enterprize. Having pa&s;&s;ed his detachment in whale boats through the &s;ound, and landed on the north branch of the i&s;land, where it is inter&s;ected by a bay that runs in far from the ea&s;t end, and having carried their boats over the arm of land which was in their way, to prevent all di&s;covery from the royal cruizers, they embarked again in the bay, which Meigs cro&s;&s;ed with 150 men, and landed on the &s;outh branch of the i&s;land, within four miles of Sagg Har|bour. They arrived at the place on the morning of the 24th of May, before break of day, and notwith|&s;tanding the re&s;i&s;tance which they met with from the guard and the crews of the ve&s;&s;els, and the vigorous efforts of the &s;chooner, which kept up a continual fire of round and grape &s;hot, within 150 yards di&s;tance, they fully completed their de&s;ign; having burnt a do|zen
<PB N="245" REF="250">of brigs and &s;loops which lay at the wharf, and entirely de&s;troyed every thing on the &s;hore. They brought off with them about 90 pri&s;oners, con&s;i&s;ting of the officers who commanded with the men, the commi&s;&s;aries, mo&s;t of the ma&s;ters and crews of the &s;mall ve&s;&s;els, which they de&s;troyed. There is a cir|cum&s;tance which is &s;omewhat curious, provided it is literally true, a&s;&s;erted by the Americans. They &s;ay that the party returned to Guildford in Connecticut, in 25 hours from the time of their departure, having dur|ing that &s;pace not only effectually compleated the de|&s;ign of their expedition, but having traver&s;ed no le&s;s by land and water than 90 miles. A degree of expe|dition that is a little incredible, and from which, if the fact is e&s;tabli&s;hed, it would appear that Meigs po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;es no &s;mall portion of that &s;pirit which operated in the Canada expedition. In this manner did the peo|ple of Connecticut return the vi&s;it of his Maje&s;ty's forces, and gained as much advantage as their friend General Tryon, with a great deal of le&s;s lo&s;s, and in a far &s;horter time. This was a &s;ignature of enterprize in the behaviour of the coloni&s;ts, which was ominous to the King's forces, and &s;hewed what the &s;pirit of &s;uch men would lead them to, if once they were compleatly armed, and in a proper &s;tate of di&s;cip|line.</P>
<P>The &s;pring was now over, and the &s;ea&s;on for action far advanced, but from &s;ome improvidence and inat|tention very unaccountable at home, the army was re&s;trained from taking the field through the want of tents and field equipage. Lord Cornwallis however made a &s;hift with the old tents to encamp the forces at Brun&s;wick on the hills that commanded the Rari|ton, and formed a communication from that river to
<PB N="246" REF="251">Amboy: The example being followed at the latter place by General Vaughan. This delay was of the greate&s;t importance to the coloni&s;ts. The winter campaign had been principally carried on by detach|ments of the militia, the greater part of whom return|ed home when the &s;ervice was expired. Others, more generous, more patient of labour, or more &s;an|guine in the common cau&s;e, out-&s;tayed the allotted time merely from a con&s;ideration of the weakne&s;s of the army, and the ruin which mu&s;t attend their de|parture before it was reinforced. The bu&s;ine&s;s of recruiting under the engagement of &s;erving during the war, or even for three years went on &s;lowly. The term of &s;ervice it is &s;aid, was contrary to the genius of the people, and the different provinces found the greate&s;t difficulty in rai&s;ing their complement of troops which had been allotted to them by the congre&s;s. Their la&s;t re&s;ort for the pre&s;ent was to make draughts from the militia. Such an act of violence upon tho&s;e who were contending for liberty on the mo&s;t enlarged plan, and who con&s;idered all the rights of freemen as &s;a|cred, was both weari&s;ome and dangerous. Every method was tried to avoid having recour&s;e to this di&s;agreeable mea&s;ure, and final re&s;ource. In &s;ome of the colonies the enli&s;ting of apprentices, and of Iri&s;h indented &s;ervants, was permitted, contrary to former re&s;olutions and decrees, with a promi&s;e of indemnifi|cation to their ma&s;ters. Another thing which hinder|ed the &s;udden recruiting of the army in the Jer&s;eys was, that the New England provinces, which abound|ed with men, were taken up with their own dome&s;tic affairs. An inva&s;ion was expected on the &s;ide of Ca|nada; Hud&s;on's River and Rhode I&s;land afforded con|tinual room for apprehen&s;ion; nor did an expe|dition
<PB N="247" REF="252">again&s;t Bo&s;ton appear at all impo&s;&s;ible, e&s;pecially as the great number of Briti&s;h prizes that were brought into that port, had be&s;ides rendered it an object of the fir&s;t importance, and renewed and even increa&s;ed, if po&s;&s;ible, the dete&s;tation and abhorrence with which that people had been long regarded. In &s;uch circum|&s;tances, the advantages of an early campaign, and the benefit which the coloni&s;ts derived from a delay are obvious. The fine weather brought reinforce|ments from all the quarters to the Jer&s;eys. Tho&s;e who &s;huddered at a winter's campaign grew bold in &s;ummer; and the certainty of a future winter had no greater effect than di&s;tant evils u&s;ually have. Gene|ral Wa&s;hington having received new reinforcements quitted his former &s;tation in the latter end of May, in the neighbourhood of Morri&s;town, and advanced within a few miles of Brun&s;wick, when he took po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of the &s;trong country along Middle Brook. A great part of the after events of the war in the Jer|&s;eys depended upon this movement. Wa&s;hington turned that advantageous &s;ituation to every account of which it was capable. His camp winding along the cour&s;e of the hills, was &s;trongly entrenched and well covered with artillery; and it was al&s;o well &s;e|cured by the difficulties of approach, which the ground in its front threw in the way of an enemy.&mdash; In this &s;ituation he commanded a view of the Briti&s;h encampment on the hills of Brun&s;wick, and of much of the intermediate country towards that place and Amboy.</P>
<P>The Briti&s;h plan of operations was at this time a little perplexed; Wa&s;hington had taken &s;uch mea|&s;ures as neither our mini&s;try at home, nor our com|manders abroad, had &s;o much as thought of, even in
<PB N="248" REF="253">idea. They had been well informed of many con&s;e|quences, which they looked upon as vi&s;ionary, which happened as they had been foretold, but they con|tinued under the &s;ame delu&s;ion and infatuation.&mdash; There were two &s;chemes which occurred to the Bri|ti&s;h General. The fir&s;t to penetrate from New-York through the Jer&s;eys to the Delaware; to drive Wa&s;hington before him, and clear tho&s;e provinces of the enemy; reduce the inhabitants to &s;o effectual a &s;tate of &s;ubjection as to e&s;tabli&s;h a &s;afe and open com|munication between New York and the army. Af|ter this to &s;ecure the pa&s;&s;age of the Delaware, be|come ma&s;ters of Philadelphia, which would be the centre from which they would di&s;tribute conque&s;t and correction to all the colonies. This was undoubted|ly by much the &s;horte&s;t method; but even then there were &s;everal very great difficulties in the way of the execution of this project. Wa&s;hington was to be brought to a deci&s;ive action and al&s;o defeated, other|wi&s;e they could not proceed without leaving all be|hind expo&s;ed to his army. This could not be done contrary to his inclination, and it was not probable that he would ri&s;k a battle without &s;uch vi&s;ible ad|vantages as would either in&s;ure the victory to him or render our army incapable of pur&s;uing this plan of operation. Should our army leave him behind and pa&s;s the Delaware, they would have an enemy in front, and a &s;trong army in the rear, which was far from being advi&s;eable; and in ca&s;e that this project &s;hould fail, it would be the ruin of the royal cau&s;e in America. Our mini&s;try, who never have &s;een far before them, have &s;ince con&s;idered this as the mo&s;t elegible plan, and blamed General Howe for not put|ting it in execution; but according to all the concur|ring
<PB N="249" REF="254">circum&s;tances at that time, it appeared impo&s;&s;ible to have put this plan into execution. The mini&s;ter for the American department, who in his ideas of war has always differed from every brave officer, may perhaps imagine that this &s;cheme might have been executed by ob&s;erving the method which he practi&s;ed at Minden; but as he gave no particular orders to General Howe upon this head, he ought not to accu&s;e him for not doing what he found to be wholly imprac|ticable.</P>
<P>The other plan, which was more tedious, but at the &s;ame time probable, and attended with le&s;s imme|diate difficulty and lo&s;s of blood, was to make u&s;e of the &s;hipping, which had never failed in doing e&s;&s;en|tial &s;ervice, and to attack Penn&s;ylvania by the &s;ide of Che&s;apeak Bay. This opened the way into the rich|e&s;t and be&s;t of the central colonies, and led either di|rectly or by cro&s;&s;ing a county of no great extent, to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the object intended. When this point was gained, Philadelphia was to become a place of arms, and the centre of action, whil&s;t every part of the fertile and flouri&s;hing provinces of Pen&s;ylva|nia, Virginia and Maryland, would, from their deep bays and navigable rivers, be expo&s;ed to the combin|ed powerful action, and continual operation of the land and &s;ea forces. But before this plan was adopt|ed, mea&s;ures were taken in the Jer&s;eys, if po&s;&s;ible, to bring General Wa&s;hington to an action.</P>
<P>But be&s;ides the operations intended to be perform|ed in the central provinces, there was another to be carried on in the North, on the &s;ide of Canada, where very con&s;iderable army had been collected, and by the &s;ucce&s;s upon the lakes in the la&s;t campaign had a way opened for it to penetrate into the back parts
<PB N="250" REF="255">of the New England and New York provinces.&mdash; The command of this army was committed to Gene|ral Burgoyne, who was reported to be the author of the plan. The great body was to be &s;econded by a le&s;&s;er expedition from the uppermo&s;t part of Canada by the way of O&s;wego to the Mohawk river. This &s;cheme was eagerly adopted by the mini&s;try, who founded the greate&s;t hopes upon its &s;ucce&s;s. All the advantages that had ever been expected from the com|plete po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Hud&s;on's River, the e&s;tabli&s;hment of a communication between the two armies, the cut|ting off all intercour&s;e between the northern and &s;outhern colonies, with the con&s;equent opportunity of cru&s;hing the former, detached and cut off from all a&s;&s;i&s;tance, it was now hoped would have been realiz|ed. The greater hopes were indulged concerning this plan, from the opinion entertained of the effect of the &s;avages upon the minds of the Americans. It was known that the coloni&s;ts in general were in great dread of them from their cruel and wa&s;ting manner of making war. The&s;e were therefore collected at a great expence, and with much labour from all parts of the continent. In a word, this expedition &s;eemed to become the favourite mini&s;terial object of this year. It was worthy of that mini&s;ter, to who&s;e care the management of the war in that department was com|mitted, and in the hi&s;tory of his life will fill up &s;ome pages not much to his honour. The &s;cheme and the execution will be &s;een more clearly afterwards when we come to the war in Canada.</P>
<P>A number of Briti&s;h and German recruits having at la&s;t arrived at New York, with tents and field equi|page, Sir William Howe, about the middle of June, marched into the Jer&s;eys, to endeavour to bring the provincial General to an engagement. The provincials
<PB N="251" REF="256">were in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a &s;trong po&s;t, from which it was not ea&s;y to drive them; and General Wa&s;hington, be&s;ides the &s;trength of his &s;ituation, was now ren|dered con&s;iderable by new reinforcements. Several &s;trong bodies, under the command of the Generals Gates, Par&s;ons, and Arnold, advanced to the border of the North River, where they were ready to pa&s;s over to the Jer&s;eys, whenever there &s;hould be an op|portunity for action, or the nece&s;&s;ity of their friends required their a&s;&s;i&s;tance. At the &s;ame time the Jer|&s;ey militia a&s;&s;embled from all quarters with the great|e&s;t readine&s;s and zeal, to a&s;&s;i&s;t in the general cau&s;e; &s;o that whatever motion the army made, or whatever po&s;ition it took, it was watched and &s;urrounded with enemies. General Howe, tru&s;ting to the goodne&s;s of his troops and the experience of his officers, tried every method he could devi&s;e to provoke Wa&s;hing|ton to an engagement, and to make him change his &s;ituation. He pu&s;hed forward detachments and made motions as if he intended to pa&s;s him and advance to the Delaware. This mea&s;ure failing of &s;ucce&s;s, he advanced in the front of his lines, where he con|tinued for four days, examining the approaches to his camp, and accurately &s;crutinizing the &s;ituation of his po&s;ts, hoping that &s;ome weak and unguarded part might be found, upon which an attack might have been made with &s;ome probability of &s;ucce&s;s, or that when the armies were &s;o near, chance, inadvertency, impatience, or error, might occa&s;ion &s;ome movements or produce &s;ome circum&s;tance, which would bring on a general engagement. General Wa&s;hington knew the whole importance and value of his &s;ituation. As he had too much temper to be provoked or &s;urprized into a mea&s;ure which would have made him give up
<PB N="252" REF="257">his real advantages, &s;o he had too much penetra|tion to lo&s;e them by circumvention or flight. He had profited &s;o long by his cautious line of conduct, from which he had not hitherto departed, nor deviat|ed during the cour&s;e of the troubles in America, of never committing the fortune of his country to the hazard of a &s;ingle action, that he was not now inclin|ed to alter his plan, or change the rule of his con|duct, when he was not pre&s;&s;ed by any nece&s;&s;ity to do it.</P>
<P>General Howe did not give up all hopes of bring|ing Wa&s;hington from his &s;trong &s;ituation, and pur&s;u|ed a plan that had well nigh an&s;wered his de&s;ign.&mdash; Upon the 19th of June, he &s;uddenly retreated, and not without &s;ome vi&s;ible &s;ignatures of precipitation, from his po&s;ition in the front of the enemy, and with|drawing his troops from Brun&s;wick, retreated with the whole army towards Amboy. This partly pro|duced the effect which he intended. The army was eagerly pur&s;ued by &s;everal large bodies of provincial regulars, as well as of the Jer&s;ey militia, under the command of the Generals Maxwell, Lord Stirling, and Conway; the latter of whom was a Colonel of the Iri&s;h brigades, and one of that numerous train of officers in the French &s;ervice, who had taken an ac|tive part again&s;t Great Britain in this unhappy war. The royal army in this feigned retreat were guilty of &s;ome particular exce&s;&s;es; enormities, which were thought to have been permitted on purpo&s;e to enflame the pa&s;&s;ions of the coloni&s;ts, and to promote the ge|neral de&s;ign of bringing them to an engagement, were committed on this occa&s;ion.&mdash;To com|plete the delu&s;ion of the Americans, the bridge which was intended for the Delaware was thrown o|ver
<PB N="253" REF="258">the channel which &s;eparates the continent from Staten I&s;land. The heavy baggage, and all the in|cumbrances of the army were pa&s;&s;ed over; &s;ome of the troops followed, and every thing was in immedi|ate preparation for the pa&s;&s;age for the re&s;t of the ar|my. By the&s;e mea&s;ures, if the immediate de&s;ign fail|ed of &s;ucce&s;s, every thing was forwarded as much as it could be for the intended embarkation; a mea&s;ure with which the Americans were as yet unacquainted, and of which they had not any information. Every circum&s;tance concurred, along with the vanity natural to mankind, to induce the Americans to believe that it was a real and not a pretended flight, and that it proceeded from a knowledge of their &s;uperiority, and a dread of their power. General Wa&s;hington, not|with&s;tanding all his caution, was &s;o far impo&s;ed upon by this feint, that he quitted his &s;ecure po&s;ts upon the hills, and advanced to a place called Qubble-town, to be nearer at hand to protect or &s;upport his advanced parties. Wa&s;hington was very near on this occa&s;ion en&s;nared, and was certainly very much off his guard to &s;uffer him&s;elf to become a dupe to a piece of mere artifice, which he might readily have perceived could proceed from none of the&s;e cau&s;es which he imagined determined General Howe to decamp, and pa&s;s his men over the channel. Some days pa&s;&s;ed while the&s;e motions and manoeuvres were carrying on, when the Briti&s;h General on a &s;udden changed his cour&s;e and marched his army back by different routs, and with great expedition to Amboy. There were three things he had in view by this change of his po&s;ition. To cut of &s;ome of the principal advanced parties to bring the enemy to an engagement in the neighbourhood of Qubble-town; or if this de&s;ign &s;hould fail through
<PB N="254" REF="259">the celerity of the enemy, it was intended that Lord Cornwallis, who with his column of troops was to take a con&s;iderable circuit to the right, &s;hould, by turning the left of the provincials, take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of &s;ome pa&s;|&s;es in the mountains, which by their &s;ituation and command of ground would have reduced them to a nece&s;&s;ity of abandoning that &s;trong camp, which had hitherto afforded them &s;o advantageous a &s;ecurity.&mdash; This part of Lord Cornwallis's appointment had more difficulties attending it than were at fir&s;t perceived; for after he had di&s;per&s;ed &s;ome &s;mall advanced parties he fell in with about 3000 men under the command of Lord Stirling, &s;trongly po&s;ted in a woody country, and well covered by artillery judiciou&s;ly di&s;po&s;ed full in his way, and &s;eemingly determined to di&s;pute his pa&s;&s;age with great vigour and firmne&s;s. The Briti&s;h and He&s;&s;ian troops, by a mutual emulation, exerted all their vigour, and fought with great intrepedity; they pre&s;&s;ed forward to try who &s;hould fir&s;t come to a clo&s;e-engagement with the enemy, and overcome all ob&s;tacles. The coloni&s;ts, who both knew that they were not an equal match for the Briti&s;h be&s;t troops, and be&s;ides were ordered not to hazard too much, made the be&s;t u&s;e of their artillery and &s;mall arms up|on their enemy as they advanced, and then retreated as fa&s;t as they could. Several men on both &s;ides were killed on this occa&s;ion, though we have never yet had a true and di&s;tinct account of the killed and wound|ed.</P>
<P>The Americans, who had the advantage of the woods, and had their artillery well placed and al&s;o well &s;upplied, did con&s;iderable execution upon the Briti&s;h troops, of which our accounts make no men|tion.
<PB N="255" REF="260">They were however forced to fly with &s;ome lo&s;s, and left three pieces of bra&s;s cannon in the hands of the Briti&s;h guards and the He&s;&s;ian grenadi|ers. Our men pur&s;ued the fugitives as far as We&s;t|field, but the woods and the inten&s;e heat of the wea|ther prevented the pur&s;uit producing any effect. In this attack tho&s;e who boa&s;ted of victory &s;uffered more than the vanqui&s;hed, and the fatigue of their march rendered them unfit for any action in a &s;hort time.</P>
<P>General Wa&s;hington by this time perceived his er|ror, and &s;peedily remedied it by withdrawing his ar|my from the plains, and again recovered his &s;trong camp upon the hills. At the &s;ame time perceiving the further de&s;ign of Lord Cornwallis, he &s;ecured tho&s;e pa&s;&s;es upon the mountains, the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of which by the Briti&s;h troops would have laid him under the ne|ce&s;&s;ity of a critical change of &s;ituation, which could not be executed without much danger. Thus was General Howe's well concerted &s;cheme of bringing the enemy to action, or at lea&s;t of withdrawing them from their &s;trong holds, rendered abortive by the caution and prudence of General Wa&s;hington. In this attempt General Howe &s;hewed a great deal of military addre&s;s and foreca&s;t, and did all that any of|ficer could have done to fulfil the de&s;ign which he had in view. But he was &s;o well matched in point of General&s;hip by General Wa&s;hington, that the ut|mo&s;t bounds of his military plans and operations were inve&s;tigated by that officer, either before they were executed, or as &s;oon as they began to be put in prac|tice, and generally prevented from producing any effect.</P>
<P>Sir William Howe was now convinced that Wa&s;h|ington was too firmly attached to his defen&s;ive plan
<PB N="252" REF="261">of operation in conducting the war, to be induced by any other means than by &s;ome very clear and de|cided advantage, to hazard a general engagement.&mdash; Nothing now remained to be done in the Jer&s;eys.&mdash; To advance to the Delaware through an enemy's country, and with &s;uch a force in his rear, appeared to the Briti&s;h commanders a project pregnant with folly, and approaching near to madne&s;s. They had found by experience that the provincials could fight when they perceived that it was for their advantage, and that in ca&s;e of marching through the Jer&s;eys to the Delaware, they would have many difficulties, and what aggravated the circum&s;tances, was, that the King's troops knew of no friends before them in ca&s;e of any misfortune. All delay and wa&s;te of time now in the Jer&s;eys was fruitle&s;s, and could an&s;wer no va|luable purpo&s;e; it was better to employ the troops in &s;ome other quarter, where &s;ome advantages might be gained. This was the opinion of the Briti&s;h of|ficers in general, as well as of the commanders in chief. General Howe accordingly returned with his troops to Amboy, and pa&s;&s;ed them over to Staten I&s;land, from whence the embarkation was to take place.</P>
<P>The preparation for this grand expedition excited a general alarm over all America. Bo&s;ton, the North River, the Delaware, Che&s;apeak Bay, were alternate|ly con&s;idered as its objects. General Wa&s;hington en|deavoured to inform him&s;elf in the be&s;t manner he could concerning the object of this expedition; he made u&s;e of all the &s;pies he had about New York and other parts, to try if he could &s;ift out the place of its de&s;tination, that he might put the people upon their guard, and provide again&s;t the impending danger.&mdash;
<PB N="257" REF="262">It was one of the manife&s;t advantages of the&s;e &s;ea adventures, that it was next to impo&s;&s;ible for Gene|ral Wa&s;hington directly to know where the &s;torm would fall. He was therefore under the nece&s;|&s;ity to continue in his pre&s;ent &s;ituation, and the King's troops were proceeding to the place of de&s;tination before he could be in readine&s;s to re&s;i&s;t them. By this means he could not have that choice of po&s;ts, by which hitherto he had had it in his power to avoid an action.</P>
<P>While this grand expedition was preparing, and the Americans were in anxious apprehen&s;ion concern|ing its de&s;tination, a &s;pirited adventure was underta|ken by a few of the provincials. This adventure not only retaliated the &s;urpri&s;e of General Lee, but &s;eem|ed to procure an indemnification for his per&s;on. Up|on the 10th of June, Colonel Barton, a provincial of|ficer, with &s;ome other officers and volunteers, pa&s;&s;ed over by night from Providence to Rhode I&s;land, and though they had a long pa&s;&s;age by water, they elud|ed the watchfulne&s;s of the &s;hips of war which &s;ur|rounded the i&s;land, and conducted their enterprize with &s;uch &s;ilence, &s;ecrecy, boldne&s;s, and dexterity, that they &s;urpri&s;ed General Pre&s;cot, who command|ed in chief, in his quarters, and brought him and his aid de-camp, through all tho&s;e perils, &s;afe to the con|tinent. The method they pur&s;ued was, as &s;oon as they came near the King's &s;hips they muffled their oars, and rowed to the place of their de&s;tination, where the rowers lay upon their oars, and the Colo|nel and his party went a-&s;hore. They proceeded to the General's quarters through a field of growing corn, unperceived by any of the guards upon the i&s;land, and came &s;traight to the hou&s;e where the Ge|neral was; and having &s;ecured a centinel at the door,
<PB N="258" REF="263">Colonel Barton boldly ru&s;hed in, and found the Ge|neral, with mo&s;t of his cloathes off, going to bed.&mdash; There was not much ceremony u&s;ed in conver&s;a|tion; he was ordered immediately to come off ju&s;t as he was, and to keep &s;ilence, otherwi&s;e he &s;hould die that moment he made the &s;malle&s;t noi&s;e, both he and his aid-de-camp; but provided they did not make noi&s;e or re&s;i&s;tance, they &s;hould be u&s;ed as gentlemen, and receive no harm. They were carried off in this manner, and led by the Colonel and his party thro' the field of corn and brought to the boat that was waiting for their arrival, in which they were immedi|ately put and carried to the continent. This was a mo&s;t terrible mortification to General Pre&s;cot, who not long before this had carried matters to &s;uch a length as to &s;et a price upon the head of General Ar|nold, and offered a reward of 1000<ABBR>l.</ABBR> for taking his per&s;on, as if he had been a common outlaw, or a rob|ber; an in&s;ult which Arnold returned by offering 500<ABBR>l.</ABBR> to &s;uch as &s;hould apprehend General Pre&s;cot, &s;ignifying that he did not think him worth a thou&s;and pounds, nor of &s;o much value as him&s;elf. Amid&s;t all the hurry and threatening of war, the continental congre&s;s did not forget tho&s;e &s;econdary means, that as well as immediate intere&s;t, render men brave and intrepid in the cau&s;e of his country. As a te&s;timony of public gratitude and an excitement to virtue and true patrioti&s;m, they ordered, that a monument &s;hould be erected at Bo&s;ton in honour of Major-General Warren, who commanded and fell at the battle of Bunker's-hill; and another in Virginia in honour of Brigadier-General Mercer, who was &s;lain in the ac|tion near Princetown in the Jer&s;eys. The re&s;olution conveyed in a very few words the highe&s;t eulogium
<PB N="255" REF="264">on the characters and merits of the decea&s;ed. They al|&s;o decreed that the former of the&s;e gentlemen, and the younge&s;t &s;on of the latter, &s;hould be educated at the expence of the United States. As General Mer|cer had a good landed e&s;tate, the propriety of adopt|ing his younge&s;t &s;on, as the child of the public is abundantly evident. It was ea&s;y to perceive, that men who were &s;o zealous in pur&s;uing wi&s;e and pru|dent mea&s;ures in the mo&s;t inferior parts of policy, were not to be over-reached by a people drowned in corruption, and &s;unk in vice.</P>
<P>Though the preparations for the grand expedition had been pur&s;ued for &s;ome time with great zeal and alacrity, and the crews of 300 ve&s;&s;els had given their a&s;&s;i&s;tance, yet &s;uch were the unavoidable delays inci|dent to &s;uch extreme operations, that it was not till the 23d of July that the fleet and army could depart from Sandy Hook. With a de&s;ign to deceive and perplex the provincials, the General ordered &s;ome tran&s;ports with a &s;hip cut down to act as a floating battery, up the North River, a little before the em|barkation was compleated; a feint which &s;ucceeded &s;o far as to induce General Wa&s;hington to detach a con&s;iderable body of his troops a-cro&s;s that river.&mdash; The force that embarked upon this expedition con|&s;i&s;ted of thirty-&s;ix Briti&s;h and He&s;&s;ian battalions, in|cluding the light infantry and grenadiers, a powerful artillery, a body of New Yorkers, called the Queen's rangers, and a regiment of light hor&s;e. Seventeen bat|talions, with a regiment of light hor&s;e, and the re|mainder of the new provincial troops, were left for the protection of New York and the adjoining i&s;lands. Seven battalions remained in Rhode I&s;land. So much was the army weakened by keeping po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of
<PB N="260" REF="265">the&s;e places, which it was indi&s;pen&s;ibly nece&s;&s;ary to hold as important po&s;ts. General Howe had once intended to have taken a greater force with him up|on this occa&s;ion, but upon the repre&s;entation of Sir Henry Clinton, who was to command in his ab&s;ence, of the danger which the i&s;lands would be expo&s;ed to from the exten&s;ivene&s;s of their coa&s;ts, and the great number of po&s;ts what were nece&s;&s;arily to be maintain|ed; he acknowledged the force of the&s;e arguments by di&s;embarking &s;everal regiments.</P>
<P>Many conjectures were formed by the provincials concerning this expedition, though they were as yet uncertain concerning its real de&s;tination. It howe|ver alarmed them greatly, though it did not di&s;pirit them.&mdash;There was another thing that &s;eemed to threaten them at this time with dreadful con&s;equences. General Burgoyne was making a rapid progre&s;s in the North, and &s;ome of their own officers but had behav|ed indifferently. Ticonderago had been given up in a manner that was not expected, and &s;ome of the offi|cers were greatly blamed for giving it up &s;o ea&s;ily.&mdash; They on this occa&s;ion behaved with a firmne&s;s that would have done honour to a Roman &s;enate, and did not &s;hew the &s;malle&s;t de&s;pondency under the&s;e misfor|tunes. They immediately i&s;&s;ued orders to recal all the troops to the head quarters, and an enquiry to be made into the conduct of the general officers who had abandoned Ticonderago;&mdash;they directed General Wa&s;hington to appoint other commanders, and to &s;ummon &s;uch numbers of the militia from the Ea&s;tern and central provinces for the Northern &s;ervice, as he &s;hould judge &s;ufficient for re&s;training the progre&s;s of the enemy. The mea&s;ures taken on this occa&s;ion to check the progre&s;s of General Burgoyne, in the con|clu&s;ion
<PB N="261" REF="266">fulfilled their mo&s;t &s;anguine expectations, as we &s;hall &s;ee in its proper place.</P>
<P>This new expedition was at fir&s;t not attended with favourable circum&s;tances; the winds were contrary, and its progre&s;s to the place of de&s;tination was &s;low.&mdash; It co&s;t them a week before they could gain the Capes of the Delaware. When they arrived there the com|manders received information that the enemy had tak|en mea&s;ures for rendering the navigation of that river impracticable, which damped the &s;pirits of the com|manders in pur&s;uing their de&s;ign by that way. They at la&s;t gave it up, and adopted another plan. The pa&s;&s;age by Che&s;apeak Bay to that part of Maryland, which lies towards the ea&s;t of that va&s;t inlet, which is not far from Philadelphia, was now fixed upon as more open, and being attended with fewer ob&s;tacles to hin|der their operations. But here again the winds were contrary in this part of the voyage, &s;o that it was pa&s;t the middle of Augu&s;t before they entered Che&s;apeak Bay; this was a circum&s;tance very unfavourable at this &s;ea&s;on of the year, when the weather was hot, and when the &s;hips were crowded with men and hor&s;es cooped up together in the &s;ame ve&s;&s;els. And which mu&s;t have been attended with the mo&s;t fatal con&s;e|quences, provided the commander in chief had not taken care to guard again&s;t every event, by the un|bounded provi&s;ion he had made for the voyage, as a failure of any one article, even that of water, would have been irremediable in tho&s;e parts at that &s;ea&s;on.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as they entered the Bay the winds turned favourable, &s;o that the fleet reached the mouth of the Elk, near its extremity, in &s;afety, through a mo&s;t $ntricate and dangerous navigation, for &s;uch a multi|tude
<PB N="262" REF="267">of ve&s;&s;els, in which the Admiral performed the different parts of a commander, inferior officer, and pilot, with great ability and per&s;everance. Having proceeded up the Elk as far as it was capable of ad|mitting their pa&s;&s;age, the army was at length relieved from its long and tedious confinement on board the tran&s;ports, being landed without oppo&s;ition at Elk Ferry on the 25th of Augu&s;t, in a degree of health and &s;pirits &s;carcely to have been expected. One part of the army advanced at the head of the Elk, and the other continued at the landing place, to protect and forward the artillery &s;tores and nece&s;&s;ary provi|&s;ions; for the General did not permit the troops to be encumbered with any baggage, and the &s;carcity of car|riage rendered a great abridgement in the article of tents nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>General Wa&s;hington, who had for &s;ome time been in &s;u&s;pen&s;e concerning the de&s;tination of this arma|ment was at la&s;t truly informed of the place of its ap|pointment; this had generally been well conjectured from the fir&s;t of its preparation, though none pretend|ed to be particularly certain of the very point where it would operate. The General as &s;oon as he was &s;ufficiently informed of the landing of the enemy, marched his army from the Jer&s;eys to the defence of Philadelphia, and upon hearing that the enemy was landed at the Elk, advanced to the Brandy Wine Creek or River which runs cro&s;s the country about half way to that city, and falls into the Delaware.&mdash; The force of the coloni&s;ts, including the militia, a|mounted to near 15000 men, making allowance for po&s;ts, and parties placed to keep a proper commu|nication with tho&s;e parts that were of the mo&s;t e&s;&s;en|tial &s;ervice to them to maintain. The King's forces
<PB N="263" REF="268">were near about the &s;ame number or &s;omewhat more numerous.</P>
<P>In order to quiet the minds of the people in Pen&s;yl|vania, Delaware counties, and the adjacent parts of Maryland, and to prevent the total de&s;ertion, and de&s;o|tion of the country in the front of the army, the Ge|neral publi&s;hed a declaration, promi&s;ing that the &s;tricte&s;t regularity &s;hould be ob&s;erved, and good order and di&s;cipline kept up by the army; that the mo&s;t ef|fectual &s;ecurity and protection &s;hould be given to all his Maje&s;ty's peaceable and well di&s;po&s;ed &s;ubjects;&mdash; extending at the &s;ame time this &s;ecurity and protection to &s;uch per&s;ons, who not having been guilty of a&s;&s;um|ing legi&s;lative power, might otherwi&s;e have acted le|gally in &s;ubordinate &s;tations, upon the provi&s;ion of their immediate returning to their habitation, and behaving peaceably for the future. This declaration al&s;o offered pardon to all officers and &s;oldiers in arms, who &s;hould &s;urrender them&s;elves to the royal army.&mdash; This was like many other declarations of the &s;ame kind very little regarded, and produced no effect.&mdash; It proceeded upon a &s;uppo&s;ition which has been the univer&s;al infatuation of the royal party from the beginning of this ruinous war, namely, that there were great numbers of per&s;ons well affected to the King through all their colonies, when in truth, except in a very few places, there were none but &s;uch as were thoroughly enemies to the royal cau&s;e, and were ready to take up arms again&s;t it. Had General Wa&s;h|ington publi&s;hed a &s;imilar declaration to the King's army, he would have found as many de&s;erters as Sir William Howe did, and his declaration would have produced much the &s;ame effect. There has been no|thing which has rendered our General officers and
<PB N="264" REF="269">commi&s;&s;ioners more ridiculous than their proclama|tions and official declarations. The&s;e have been &s;o defective in point of compo&s;ition, and &s;o enigmatical in their &s;tile, that they have had generally the ap|pearance of being the compo&s;itions of &s;ome blunder|ing lawyers, who always write not to be under&s;tood. All the papers in general which have been publi&s;hed &s;ince the beginning of this war, whether the accounts of battles, the victory and other tran&s;actions have been written more in the &s;tile of the Sibyline oracles than in the expe&s;&s;ion of narrations intended to inform the public concerning matters of fact.</P>
<P>The royal army did not leave the head of the Elk until the third of September, when they began their march towards Philadelphia. In the mean time the provincials had advanced from Brandy Wine, and tak|en po&s;t at Red Clay Creek, from whence they pu&s;hed forward detachments to &s;eize the difficult po&s;ts in the woods, and to interrupt the march of the royal forces by continual &s;kirmi&s;hes. As the country was woody and difficult, and not well known by the roy|ali&s;ts, and the coloni&s;ts under&s;tood how to improve &s;uch circum&s;tances, the General was obliged to march &s;lowly, and ob&s;erve great caution; and con&s;idering his &s;ituation, and the character of the commander in oppo&s;ition, there was much nece&s;&s;ity for caution and circum&s;pection in every &s;tep of his march. The Bri|ti&s;h troops, were indeed brave, well commanded, and under good di&s;cipline; they were ready and willing to fight at command, but then they could not perform impo&s;&s;ibilities. They had lately felt that the colo|ni&s;ts could fight, and make a more formidable im|pre&s;&s;ion upon their ranks than they had beed taught to believe that they ever could. This had removed
<PB N="265" REF="270">that fanta&s;tic apprehen&s;ion that the provincials were all cowards, and made even the private &s;oldiers be|come le&s;s &s;anguine in their ideas of victory.</P>
<P>General Howe was now from nece&s;&s;ity as well as from his human di&s;po&s;ition, &s;paring of his men. He knew that recruits were to be brought from a great di&s;tance, and procured with difficulty even at the &s;ource. Every man killed, wounded, or taken, was to him an irretrievable lo&s;s, and &s;o far as it went, an incurable weakening of the army, for the pre&s;ent year at lea&s;t.&mdash;On the other hand, the enemy were at home. Every lo&s;s they &s;u&s;tained was not only imme|diately repaired, but the military abilities of the &s;ur|vivors were encrea&s;ed by every de&s;truction of their fellows. This caution could not prevent &s;ome &s;kir|mi&s;hes, in which the royal forces were &s;aid to he always victorious. It mu&s;t be ob&s;erved that in the&s;e &s;kir|mi&s;hes the coloni&s;ts generally fled but it was from one po&s;t to another; when, after they had killed a number of our men advancing, they retired to another po&s;t without any lo&s;s.</P>
<P>This was an effectual method to thin our army in|&s;en&s;ibly without much lo&s;s to them&s;elves, and was in effect a &s;low but &s;ure victory. It was thought at this time, that the Americans did not make all the u&s;e of the advantages of the country that might have been expected, by harra&s;&s;ing and interrupting the progre&s;s of the King's troops; but it is plain tho&s;e that affirm this are not acquainted with the de&s;igns of General Washington, nor the &s;cheme he now had in view.&mdash; He wanted to try his men by a more general action, with as much &s;afety to his army and the main cau&s;e as po&s;&s;ible; for this rea&s;on he retired beyond Brandy Wine, and took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the heights, that cover|ed
<PB N="266" REF="271">the fords, with an intention of di&s;puting the pa&s;|&s;age of that river. In this &s;ituation upon the 11th of of September the Briti&s;h forces advanced in two co|lumns towards the enemy. The right, under the command of General Knyphau&s;en, marched directly to Chad's Ford, which lay in the centre of the enemy's line, where they expected and waited for the principal attack: their right and left covered le&s;s practicable fords and pa&s;&s;ages for &s;ome miles on either hand. An heavy canonade began on both &s;ides about ten o'clock, which was continued and well &s;upported during the day, whil&s;t General Howe, to amu&s;e and deceive the enemy, made repeated attempts for forcing the fords, as if the pa&s;&s;age of the river had been the principal object he had in view. The Americans, to fru&s;trate this intention, had pa&s;&s;ed &s;everal detachments to the other &s;ide, who continued a cour&s;e of &s;kirmi&s;h|es, &s;ometimes advancing and &s;ometimes retreating, till at la&s;t they were driven over the river. General Howe finding that he met with a more vigorous re|&s;i&s;tance than he at fir&s;t expected, endeavoured to com|pleat by &s;tratagem what he could not perform by force, continued the appearance of an attack to keep up the attention of the coloni&s;ts in the neighbourhood of Chad's Ford, where they &s;uppo&s;ed the whole of the King's forces were in front, but in the mean time de|tached Lord Cornwallis at the head of the &s;econd co|lumn to the left, to march in a long circle until he gain|ed the forks of the Brandy Wine, where the divi&s;ion of the river rendered it more practicable. By this judicious movement his Lord&s;hip pa&s;&s;ed both branch|es of the river at Trimbles and Jeffery's Ford, with|out oppo&s;ition or difficulty, about two o'clock in the afternoon, and then turning down the river took the
<PB N="267" REF="272">road to Dilworth to fall upon the right of the provin|cials. General Wa&s;hington received &s;ooner notice of this manoeuvre than General Howe expected, and had provided again&s;t its con&s;equences as well as he could. He detached General Sullivan with all the force he could &s;pare from the main body to oppo&s;e Lord Corn|wallis. Sullivan performed this commi&s;&s;ion with great judgment and ability. He took a &s;trong po&s;t on the commanding grounds above Birmingham church with his left extending towards Brandy Wine, his artillery was advantageou&s;ly di&s;po&s;ed, and both flanks covered with thick woods.</P>
<P>Lord Cornwallis, who did not at all imagine that his march was known by the enemy, was a little &s;urpriz|ed to find Sullivan &s;o well po&s;ted and ready to oppo&s;e him. He was obliged to halt, and to form the line of battle, &s;o it was four o'clock before he could begin the action. The Briti&s;h troops began the attack, and met with a warm re&s;i&s;tance; the artillery and &s;mall arms played upon them furiou&s;ly, and they left many on the field as they advanced. They however ru&s;hed on through all ob&s;tacles, and di&s;lodged their enemies with much difficulty. The grenadiers and guards, and the be&s;t of our troops were engaged in this action.&mdash; Having driven the Americans from their po&s;t they pur|&s;ued them into the woods on their rear; but in the mean time a part of the provincials right wing which had not &s;uffered much, took a &s;econd po&s;t in a wood on the &s;ame &s;ide, where they made a &s;tout re&s;i&s;tance, and were driven from it with much difficulty.&mdash; Some of the Briti&s;h troops in the eagerne&s;s of pur&s;uit were &s;o deeply entangled in the woods that it was night before they could join the main body. When now the Briti&s;h forces imagined that they had gained
<PB N="268" REF="273">a complete victory, and were advancing, they came upon a party of the enemy that had not yet been en|gaged, and which had taken a &s;trong po&s;t to cover the retreat of the defeated wing of their army. A very warm engagement now en&s;ued; and this po&s;t was &s;o vigorou&s;ly defended that it was &s;ome time after it was dark before it could be forced. Nor does it appear by comparing accounts that it was forced at all; be|cau&s;e the provincials kept it as long as it was of any &s;ervice, and they could &s;ee to fight, and then retreat|ed in good order. The rea&s;on given why our troops did not pur&s;ue the enemy were, that the General did not know the ground, and was unacquainted with Gen Knyphau&s;en's &s;ituation, and were not able to pro|ceed any further; all which were matters of fact.&mdash; Knyphau&s;en, after &s;ucce&s;sfully amu&s;ing the coloni&s;ts all the day with the apprehen&s;ion of an attack which he did not intend, made good his pa&s;&s;age in the evening, when he found that his enemy was deeply engaged on the right. He carried the entrenchment, and took the battery and cannon which defended Chad's Ford. At this time the approach of the Briti&s;h troops which had been engaged in the woods, threw the provincials into confu&s;ion, and a retreat was ordered and made in the face of the King's forces. It was &s;aid that the latene&s;s of the night, and the darkne&s;s of the evening prevented the King's troops from pur&s;uing, as it had done, tho&s;e on the right wing, but the truth of the matter was, that both &s;ides were &s;ufficiently wearied of that day's exerci&s;e.</P>
<P>Such as follow the reports of government at that time have affirmed that a few hours more would have produced a total defeat to the Americans; but they knew but little of the operations of that tedious and
<PB N="269" REF="274">ho&s;tile day's work that make this conclu&s;ion. The provincials had not &s;uffered more than the King's troops, and though they gave way to the mad impe|tuo&s;ity of de&s;perate men for a little, yet they recover|ed their po&s;ts, and rai&s;ed redoubts which our troops were obliged to attack a-new, with a great expence of blood, as well as much fatigue.</P>
<P>A great part of the American troops, among whom &s;ome of the Virginian regiments, and the whole body of their artillery behaved exceedingly well in &s;everal actions of this day, and &s;hewed &s;uch a degree of or|der, &s;teadine&s;s, and valour, as would have done ho|nour to the mo&s;t veteran forces. Some of their more raw troops did not behave &s;o well. The lo&s;s on both &s;ides, when we compare the different accounts, was nearly about equal. In our Gazette the lo&s;s of the coloni&s;ts was computed at about 300 killed 600 wounded, and 400 taken pri&s;oners. They al&s;o lo&s;t ten &s;mall field pieces, and a howitzer, of which, all except one, was bra&s;s. The lo&s;s on the &s;ide of the King's troops was e&s;timated in the Gazette near to 500, of which the &s;lain did not make one third. No officers of great note were killed on either &s;ide. The Americans did not deny that their lo&s;s was nearly to the amount that has been mentioned, but they &s;ay, and give &s;ome rea&s;ons for what they affirm, that the lo&s;s on our &s;ide was equal, if not &s;uperior, to theirs. That there were &s;ome of the attacks of our men de&s;|perate, which expo&s;ed them to danger when they could do no execution upon their opponents; that the coloni&s;ts kept up a well directed fire upon them as they advanced, and when they were out of breath and ready to fall on with the bayonets, they retreated fa&s;ter than they were able to pur&s;ue them; that they
<PB N="270" REF="275">often led them on to meet a fre&s;h party who after giving them a few well-aimed vollies retired and left them in the &s;ame manner to pur&s;ue as they were able. That by this method of fighting the provincials were very little expo&s;ed and yet did great execution upon their enemies.</P>
<P>In this engagement General Howe acted the part of a &s;killful General and did all that was in his power to obtain a complete victory.&mdash;His detaching of Lord Cornwallis and his column was a wi&s;e and prudent manoeuvre, and in this he nearly out-&s;chemed General Wa&s;hington.&mdash;But the other &s;hewed a rea|dine&s;s of invention and penetration in detaching Sulli|van, that &s;hewed he knew how to make the be&s;t even of a di&s;advantage. Whatever may be the merits of both generals it mu&s;t be granted that the King's army was led on with great judgment, and commanded with much &s;agacity, and the commanding officers did all that could have been expected of great commanders. It is to be ob&s;erved, that in this battle the provincial forces were met in the open field, and with no great advantage of &s;ituation. The King's troops obtained a victory, but not of that final and deci&s;ive kind which the public were made to expect from the boa&s;ting of the mini&s;try, and the &s;uppo&s;ed valour of our men. It had been long imagined by &s;ome, and po&s;itively af|firmed by the &s;anguine &s;upporters of this war, that provided the King's troops could meet the rebels in an open field they would &s;oon put an end to the war; and now they had fought from break of day till the &s;tars appeared, and were little farther advanced than when they began. The armies were nearly equal in number, and by the confe&s;&s;ion of our men and officers the ground nearly the &s;ame to both, and yet a whole
<PB N="271" REF="276">day's de&s;perate fighting made very little alteration in the &s;tate of the war. General Howe had gained a victory and the enemy had fled, but the conqueror was obliged to be as cautious and as much upon his guard after the victory as before; which &s;hews that it was no way deci&s;ive. General Wa&s;hington &s;oon repaired his lo&s;s and was in a few days ready for the field. The Briti&s;h army was now po&s;ted at Concord and A&s;htern, whil&s;t a detachment was &s;ent to &s;eize Wilmington, which was made a receptacle for the &s;ick and the wounded. Upon his march towards Go&s;hen, the Briti&s;h general received information, that the enemy had quitted Philadelphia, and were advanced upon the Lanca&s;ter road, a few miles above that place. Upon this advice he took &s;uch effectual mea&s;ures for bringing them to an engagement, that nothing but the event which happened could have pre|vented his de&s;ign. An exce&s;&s;ive fall of rain which overtook both armies upon their march, and which continued without intermi&s;&s;ion for 24 hours, rendered both parties equally incapable for action.</P>
<P>General Howe lo&s;t this opportunity, and though he tried all his art for &s;everal days, and moved back|wards and forwards, and in all directions belonging to the art of war, he could not bring the Americans into the &s;ituation they had been in before. While he was bu&s;ied in marching and counter-marching, he re|ceived information that General Wayne with 1500 men, was lying in the woods upon &s;ome &s;cheme of enterprize, in the rear, and at a &s;mall di&s;tance from the left wing of the army. He detached Major Gene|ral Grey with two regiments and a body of light in|fantry to &s;urprize them in the night. General Grey conducted this enterprize with equal ability and &s;uc|ce&s;s,
<PB N="272" REF="277">though perhaps not with that humanity which is &s;o generally con&s;picuous in his character. In imi|tation of a &s;imilar proceeding at the battle of Minden, he took effectual mea&s;ures that a &s;ingle &s;hot &s;hould not be fired in the cour&s;e of the expedition, and that the execution &s;hould only be done by the point of the bayonets. The night favoured this de&s;ign, as the troops marched &s;ilently on the enemy unawares; had they been perceived before they came near it would not have been ea&s;y to have attacked them, as they would have &s;pent &s;ome fires upon their enemy, and retreated for &s;afety. In pur&s;uing this de&s;ign the pro|vincial out-po&s;ts, and pickets, were compleatly &s;ur|prized and forced, without noi&s;e, about one in the morning, and the troops being directed by the light of their fires, ru&s;hed in upon the encampment, where a &s;evere and horrible execution en&s;ued, about 300 being either killed or wounded upon the &s;pot, and a number of pri&s;oners taken. The remainder e&s;caped by the darkne&s;s of the night, and &s;ome prudent di&s;|po&s;itions made by the officer who commanded the A|mericans, with the lo&s;s of the greate&s;t part of their baggage, arms, and &s;tores. The conquerors in this action lo&s;t only a captain of light infantry, and three private men, and about as many wounded. The Bri|ti&s;h troops as well as the officer that commanded them gained but little honour by this midnight &s;laughter.&mdash; It &s;hewed rather de&s;perate cruelty than real valour to put &s;o many men to the &s;word who were not under arms, but the greate&s;t part a&s;leep in their huts or tents &s;unk in drow&s;ine&s;s which is common to all men in the night when they are expecting no danger.&mdash; The commanding officer of the provincials was much to blame for being at all off his guard when he was &s;o near
<PB N="273" REF="278"><GAP DESC="MISSING">an enemy; for had his out guards been placed &s;o as to have given the alarm in time, they might have been able either to have defended them&s;elves, or fled from the fury of a de&s;perate enemy.</P>
<P>It was &s;aid that a great number of tho&s;e that were killed on that occa&s;ion, were people who had left their hou&s;es and fled for &s;helter into the woods for fear of the enemy; that few of them had any arms, and were not in a &s;ituation to defend them&s;elves. It is the unavoidable con&s;equence of all wars, but e&s;pe|cially civil wars, to involve the innocent and helple&s;s in the &s;ame hard&s;hips and di&s;tre&s;s, with the guilty; and it is frequently in &s;ome ca&s;es difficult to di&s;tin|gui&s;h the one from the other in the mid&s;t of the bu&s;tle of war and the commixture of parties. Acci|dents of this nature falling out in the hands of Gene|ral Grey or Sir William Howe, carried a wor&s;e a&s;pect, than if they had happened under the autho|rity of a Vaughan, a Grant, or a Prevo&s;t. The profe&s;&s;ions of liberty which the&s;e fir&s;t gentlemen had &s;o often made, and their former character, as hu|mane and brave men, made any action that had the appearance of cruelty, or was inimical to the gene|ral rights of mankind, &s;trike the attention of the public more forcibly, than any tran&s;actions from the hands of tho&s;e from whom no better things were ex|pected. It was even painful to many true friends of the Briti&s;h con&s;titution, that one of the fir&s;t and greate&s;t officers in Europe, and a profe&s;&s;ed friend of the na|tural rights of mankind, &s;hould &s;o much as be &s;u&s;|pected of an action unworthy of his character. They endeavoured to cover this tran&s;action with the mantle of charity, and to put as favourable a con&s;truction upon it as po&s;&s;ible. Hi&s;tory mu&s;t do ju&s;tice to truth,
<PB N="274" REF="279">and tran&s;mit tran&s;actions to po&s;terity as they happen|ed, without re&s;pect of per&s;ons or regard to particular attachments. The&s;e ideas of honour, which military men often are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of determine them to pur&s;uits, which, as philo&s;ophers, their minds can never ap|prove. It has much the appearance of incon&s;i&s;ten|cy, for men to di&s;approve of a war as unrighteous, and oppre&s;&s;ive, and yet become the principal conduc|tors of it, and leaders in the oppre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>General Howe finding that the enemy could not by any means be brought to action, and that they were ardently abandoning the protection of the capital, rather than hazard a final deci&s;ion, took mea&s;ures, to po&s;&s;e&s;s him&s;elf of the command of the Schuylkill, which at length enabled him to pa&s;s the army over that river without oppo&s;ition. Upon September 26th he advanced to Germantown, and next morning Lord Cornwallis took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Philadelphia. Thus was this rich and flouri&s;hing city the capital of the mo&s;t ri&s;ing colony, and the &s;eat of the general congre&s;s of delegates, who gave laws and govern|ment to the continent of North America, reduced without oppo&s;ition, and of con&s;equence without da|mage. It remains as yet among the my&s;teries of this war, why the coloni&s;ts &s;o ea&s;ily gave up this city, and why the king's troops &s;o &s;oon abandoned and left it. The Americans on this occa&s;ion acted with a prudence, and fore&s;ight, which was not the priviledge of our commanders, and commi&s;&s;ioners. They well knew that the keeping of this city, and the ob&s;tacles which they had prepared in the river Delaware to embarra&s;s the enemy, would &s;o weaken General Howe's army before he could receive any reinforce|ments, that they would have it in their power either
<PB N="275" REF="280">to make the city too hot for him, or make him aban|don it, without running the ri&s;k of a general engage|ment in the open fields. Mud I&s;land and Red Bank, were left to be mortal thorns in the &s;ides of the king's forces, where a few could do execution upon great numbers, and e&s;cape when they plea&s;ed with little injury to them&s;elves. It will appear in the hi&s;tory of this campaign, that the Americans had other de&s;igns in giving up Philadelphia, than becau&s;e they were not able to keep it.&mdash;It had been reported that the inhabitants of that city were determined to reduce it to a&s;hes, rather than it &s;hould become a place of arms, and the centre of operation to Briti&s;h fleets and armies: but though this was propo&s;ed by &s;ome it was never agreed to. The Quakers at this time were very trouble&s;ome to the coloni&s;ts: &s;ome of their principal people were great|ly attached to the royal cau&s;e, and would give no &s;e|curity by word or writing for their behaviour. They would neither promi&s;e &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the then govern|ment, nor engage to hold no corre&s;pondence with the king's forces. They even refu&s;ed to confine them&s;elves to their re&s;pective dwelling hou&s;es, and boldly appealing to the laws for redre&s;s and &s;ecurity to their per&s;ons, &s;trongly reproached tho&s;e who un|der the pretence of a&s;&s;erting and protecting the liber|ties of the &s;ubjects, had involved the whole continent in a civil war, and contention; and who at the &s;ame time, in the mo&s;t tyrannical manner, deprived them of their per&s;onal liberty, and of every &s;ecurity which they derived from the laws. It was replied, that the laws them&s;elves, and all other con&s;iderations, mu&s;t give way to public &s;afety, in ca&s;es of great and emi|nent danger; that there was no new or particular
<PB N="276" REF="281">hard&s;hip in the pre&s;ent mea&s;ure, which was ju&s;tified by the practice of all &s;tates in &s;imilar circum&s;tances: that in England in its highe&s;t &s;tate of freedom, and under its happie&s;t government, the habeas corpus law was &s;u&s;pended in ca&s;es of internal commotion, or the apprehen&s;ion of foreign inva&s;ion, that there &s;u&s;|picion only was a &s;ufficient ground for &s;ecuring the per&s;ons of &s;ubjects, without regard to rank, quality, or any &s;ecurity they might propo&s;e to give for their peaceable behaviour; but that their &s;ituation was much more favourable, if their incorrigible ob|&s;tinacy, their dangerous de&s;igns again&s;t the &s;tate, and their mortal enmity to the government, had not precluded them from its benefits. They were not retained in per&s;on merely upon &s;u&s;picion, how|ever &s;trong and well grounded that was, and how|ever ju&s;tifiable the mea&s;ures would be upon that ground only; it was immediately in their power to return in the mo&s;t unre&s;trained liberty to their habita|tions, only by complying with that very moderate te&s;t of their principles, and conduct which was re|quired, and &s;hewing that obedience to government, and good di&s;po&s;ition to the &s;tate, which every mem|ber of &s;ociety owes to the community to which he belongs, as a return for the protection he receives. But that as they denied all allegiance to the &s;tate, they of cour&s;e di&s;claimed its protection, and forfeit|ed all the privileges of citizen&s;hip; whil&s;t by refu&s;ing every &s;ecurity for their peaceable demeanour, they could only be con&s;idered as its mo&s;t dangerous and determined enemies. As the&s;e gentlemen were un|conquerable in their re&s;olution not to &s;ubmit to the propo&s;ed te&s;t, they were all &s;ent to Virginia as a place of &s;ecurity upon the approach of the royal army.</P>
<PB N="277" REF="282">
<P>When Lord Howe received intelligence of the &s;uc|ce&s;s at Brandywine, and the determined progre&s;s of the army to Philadelphia, he took the mo&s;t &s;peedy and effectual mea&s;ures for conducting the fleet and tran&s;ports round to the Delaware, not only to be at hand to concur in the active operations of the cam|paign, but to &s;upply the army with provi&s;ions and &s;tores, which he knew by this time would be indi&s;|pen&s;ibly nece&s;&s;ary. The voyage was intricate tedi|ous and dangerous, and nothing le&s;s than a &s;kill and ability equal to that which was exerted in the con|duct and managment of &s;o great a number of &s;hips, could have prevented the lo&s;s from being con&s;ider|able.</P>
<P>The pa&s;&s;age to Philadelphia was yet impracticable, the fleet drew up and anchored along the we&s;tern or Pen&s;ylvania &s;hore, from Ready-I&s;land to Newca&s;tle. After the Briti&s;h troops had taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Phi|ladelphia, their fir&s;t object was the erecting of bat|teries to command the river, both to prevent the in|tercour&s;e of the American ve&s;&s;els between their up|per and lower po&s;ts, and to protect the city from any in&s;ult by water. The nece&s;&s;ity and propriety of this mea&s;ure became obvious as &s;oon almo&s;t as it was determined upon. The day immediately after the ar|rival of the forces, the American frigate, Delaware, of 32 guns, anchored within five hundred yards of the unfini&s;hed batteries, and being &s;econded by ano|ther frigate, with &s;ome &s;maller ve&s;&s;els, they began and &s;upported a very heavy cannonade for &s;ome hours, upon the batteries and the town. They did not however di&s;cover the judgment which their know|ledge might have been &s;uppo&s;ed to afford them; for upon the falling back of the tide the Delaware
<PB N="278" REF="283">grounded, &s;o that &s;he could not be got off. This was &s;oon perceived by the grenadiers, who brought their battalion field pieces to play upon her with &s;o true an aim, and full effect, that the Delaware was obliged to &s;trike her colours, and was boarded by an officer and a detachment of the grenadiers. Ge|neral Cleveland profited by the effect of the battalion guns, by directing the whole fire of the batteries again&s;t the other ve&s;&s;els which were compelled to re|tire, with the lo&s;s of a &s;chooner which was driven a&s;hore.</P>
<P>The Americans had be&s;towed much labour and ex|pence to render the Delaware unnavigable; they had con&s;tructed great and numerous works to render the pa&s;&s;age to Philadelphia impracticable. In the pro&s;e|cution of this de&s;ign they had erected works and bat|teries, upon a flat low mar&s;hy i&s;land, or rather a bank of mud or &s;and, which had been rai&s;ed and heaped up by the water near the junction of the Schuylkill and the Delaware, and which from its nature was called Mud I&s;land.&mdash;On the &s;ide oppo|&s;ite to New Jer&s;ey, at a place called Red Bank, they had al&s;o con&s;tructed a fort or redoubt, well planted with heavy cannon. In the deep navi|gable channel between and under the cover of the&s;e batteries, they had &s;unk &s;everal ranges of frames, to which, from a &s;imilitude in the con&s;truction, they had given the French name of Chevaux de Frize, being compo&s;ed of conver&s;e beams, firmly joined pointing in various directions, and &s;trongly headed with iron. The&s;e were &s;o ponderous and heavy, and &s;unk in &s;uch a depth of water, as rendered it equally difficult for them to be weighed or cut through, and de&s;tructive to any one &s;hip that &s;hould happen to &s;trike upon them.
<PB N="279" REF="284">It was, however, impo&s;&s;ible to attempt to remove the&s;e, or to open the channel till once the command of the &s;hores on both &s;ides was fully obtained. About three miles farther down they had &s;unk other ranges of the&s;e machines, and were con&s;tructing other exten&s;ive works for their protection, which though they were not yet fini&s;hed, were in &s;uch for|wardne&s;s as to be provided with artillery, and to com|mand their object. This fortification was erected on the Jer&s;ey &s;ide, at a place called Bellings Point.&mdash; The&s;e works and machines were further &s;upported by &s;everal gallies mounting heavy connon, together with two floating batteries, a number of armed ve&s;&s;els and &s;mall craft of various kinds, and &s;ome fire &s;hips. In &s;hort the Delaware &s;eemed to teem with every de|fen&s;ive preparation which could render the navigation of the river impracticable to the fleet, and exceed|ingly dangerous to all large ve&s;&s;els that &s;hould attempt to approach Philadelphia.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t operation which was tried by the army was to di&s;lodge the enemy from Billings Fort. This office was appointed to Colonel Stirling, who perform|ed the &s;ervice effectually. For the provincials retir|ed as &s;oon as they heard of his approach, &s;piked up the cannon, &s;et fire to the barracks, and abandoned the place. Captain Hammond of the Roebuck, with great difficulty, and &s;ome oppo&s;ition from the enemy, cut away and weighed &s;o much of the Chevaux de Frize, as opened a narrow pa&s;&s;age for the &s;hips thro' the lower barriers. After the detachment which was &s;ent upon this fir&s;t exploit were returning from Jer&s;ey, another regiment was &s;ent to meet them at Che&s;ter, in order to form a &s;ufficient e&s;cort for a large convoy of provi&s;ions to the camp. The army was
<PB N="280" REF="285">&s;till lying at German Town, a very long and populous village, about &s;ix miles from Philadelphia, and which &s;tretching on both &s;ides of the great road to the north|ward forms a continued &s;treet of two miles of length. &mdash;The line of encampment cro&s;&s;ed German Town at right angles about the centre, the left wing extended on the we&s;t to the Schuylkill. That wing was cover|ed in front by the German Cha&s;&s;eurs, both mounted and unmounted; a battalion of light infantry, and the Queen's Rangers, were in the front of the right; and the fortieth regiment, with another battalion of light infantry were po&s;ted at the head of the village. Lord Cornwallis lay at Philadelphia with four battalions of grenadiers, and as we have ob&s;erved, three regiments had been detached on the &s;ide of Che&s;ter. The Ame|ricans were encamped at Shippach Creek about &s;ix|teen miles from German Town. They had received &s;ome reinforcements, and were well acquainted with the &s;ituation of the royal forces: they knew that the army was weakened by the detachments made to Philadelphia and Che&s;ter. The&s;e circum&s;tances indu|ced an enterprize which was very little expected by General Howe, and which the former caution of Ge|neral Wa&s;hington had by no means promi&s;ed. In|&s;tead of keeping as u&s;ual upon the defen&s;ive, the co|loni&s;ts now became the a&s;&s;ailants. They quitted their &s;trong po&s;t at Shippach Creek, at &s;ix in the evening, and marched all night to &s;urpri&s;e the royal army in its camp at German Town. Upon the 4th of Octo|ber their approach was di&s;covered by the patroles, and the army was immediately called to arms. They began their attack upon the 40th regiment, and the light infantry by which it was accompanied. The&s;e troops, after making all the re&s;i&s;tance they were able, were
<PB N="281" REF="286"><GAP DESC="MISSING">Mu&s;grave, who commanded in that quarter, to &s;top the impetuo&s;ity of the enemy, threw him&s;elf and &s;ix companies of the 40th regiment into a large &s;trong &s;tone hou&s;e, which lay full in the front of the provin|cials, which put a &s;top to their career, and their hope of immediately taking full po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the town; which had they effected would have enabled them ef|fectually to have &s;eparated the right and left wings of the King's army. Mu&s;grave kept his &s;ituation, and fired out at the windows, till General Grey came to his relief with three battalions of the third brigade, who attacked the enemy with vigour, &s;upported by Brigadier General Agnew at the head of the fourth brigade. The engagement was now for &s;ome time very warm, and it was for a &s;ea&s;on doubtful how mat|ters would turn. The King's troops had now full u&s;e for all the &s;kill and vigour they were ma&s;ters of, and with difficulty &s;tood their ground again&s;t the fierce attack of the Americans. The latter were howe|ver attacked from the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the village by two regiments of the right wing, which put them in|to di&s;order, and they retired out of the town with con&s;iderable lo&s;s. The&s;e were not the only part of the king's forces that were engaged on this occa&s;ion; the Pickets on the right &s;upported by the 4th and 45th regiments were warmly engaged with the left wing of the provincials. But General Grey, who had driven the right of the enemy out of the village, had now time to bring a&s;&s;i&s;tance to the right, who at this time were in con&s;iderable need of it: Upon his approach the Americans retreated, and were very gently pur&s;ued by our forces. The rea&s;ons given by our officers why they pur&s;ued with &s;o little vigour, was,
<PB N="282" REF="287">that the country was woody, &s;trong, and enclo&s;ed, that the pur&s;uit they made was attended with no effect; and one thing which proves the provincials were not hard pur&s;ued, they carried their cannon clear off. It is manife&s;t in this engagement that the Briti&s;h forces were pretty clo&s;ely engaged, and were made to feel that the cowards in Wa&s;hington's army, were on &s;ome occa&s;ions not &s;o ea&s;ily driven off. The morning being mi&s;ty, prevented &s;ome part of the American &s;uc|ce&s;s in this battle; for they could not improve the advantages they gained at fir&s;t, on account that they did not &s;ee the true &s;ituation of the enemy; and before they could advance &s;o as to pur&s;ue their ad|vantage with &s;ucce&s;s, the king's troops were recover|ed from their &s;urprize, and in a better condition to receive them. They al&s;o affirmed that they often could not &s;ee their own different bodies, and were on that account unable to act in concert. It was al&s;o &s;aid, that &s;ome of their parties in the thickne&s;s of the fog, poured their fire upon each other through a blind mi&s;take on both fides, of being engaged with the enemy. General Wa&s;hington was pre&s;ent at this engagement, and paid great compliments to his troops on the right wing, for their good behaviour, but as he was not witne&s;s to the behaviour of the left wing, he did not pay them &s;o high compliments, becau&s;e he had not &s;ufficient ground to found his opinion.&mdash; This was a more de&s;perate action than that of Bran|dywine, and the lo&s;s of the king's troops was much more con&s;iderable. Our accounts make our lo&s;s only 553 killed, wounded and pri&s;oners, and the Ameri|can lo&s;s about a thou&s;and, killed wounded and taken. The Americans rate our lo&s;s con&s;iderably more, and
<PB N="283" REF="288">their own le&s;s than our accounts do. Some of our brave&s;t officers fell in this engagement; among the number of the killed were Brigadier General Agnew, and Colonel Bird, but the number of wounded of|ficers was con&s;iderable. The Americans lo&s;t Gene|ral Na&s;h, and &s;everal other officers. In this battle the coloni&s;ts made the attack, and though they were repul&s;ed with &s;ome lo&s;s, &s;hewed them&s;elves for|midable adver&s;aries, capable of charging with re&s;o|lution, and retreating with good order. This action damped the hopes of our generals concerning gain|ing any compleat victory, even in an open and fair engagement; they found that the Briti&s;h forces could do little more than &s;tand their ground again&s;t the charge of the be&s;t troops of the coloni&s;ts, and were even put into di&s;order by them, though fully upon their guard. This fully convinced General Howe, that provided the Americans &s;hould have been con|&s;iderably reinforced, and inclined to make &s;uch ano|ther attack, that his whole force would not be able to with&s;tand them, unle&s;s he could gain &s;ome re|markable po&s;t of defence which he was not likely &s;oon to obtain. The American troops began now to under&s;tand their own con&s;equence, and perceived that the impre&s;&s;ion they made on their enemies was &s;everely felt; they therefore became more daring, and con&s;idered our forces far from being invincible. General Wa&s;hington, although he was cautious in engaging, yet in all tho&s;e actions where he was pre|&s;ent and led on the troops, he either gained &s;ome ad|vantage, or made &s;uch an impre&s;&s;ion upon his ene|mies, that they &s;everely felt the influence of his pre|&s;ence.</P>
<PB N="284" REF="289">
<P>The taking of Philadelphia was not attended with all the advantages expected from that conque&s;t. The American army &s;till kept the field, and till the Dela|ware could be cleared, it was manife&s;t that the army could not &s;upport it&s;elf in Philadelphia during the winter. The whole effect of the campaign depend|ed upon cleaning the river, and receiving &s;upplies from the fleet. About two weeks after the la&s;t battle the king's troops removed from Germantown to Philadelphia, as being a more convenient &s;ituation for the reduction of Mud-I&s;land, and for joining ope|rations with the naval force in opening the naviga|tion of the river. The Americans upon the removing of the king's troops, returned to their old camp at Shepach Creek where they continued.</P>
<P>General Howe, and his brother the Admiral, were employed in concerting mea&s;ures for opening the river, and removing all ob&s;tructions. This was an operation in which they found great difficulty, and which employed the utmo&s;t efforts of their military &s;kill and ability. The General ordered batteries to be rai&s;ed on the we&s;tern &s;hore, on the Pen&s;ylvanian &s;ide, in hopes of a&s;&s;i&s;ting in di&s;lodging the enemy from Mud-I&s;land; the difficulty of acce&s;s to which, was found to render the reduction of it much more tedi|ous and difficult than had been expected. He al&s;o detached a &s;trong body of He&s;&s;ians acro&s;s the river at Cooper's Ferry oppo&s;ite to the town, who were to march down and force the redoubt of Red Bank, whil&s;t the &s;hips and the batteries on the other &s;ide, were to carry on their attacks of Mud-I&s;land, and the enemies marine force. The He&s;&s;ian detachment was led on by Colonel Donop, who had gained &s;ome re|putation in &s;everal actions in this war; it con&s;i&s;ted,
<PB N="285" REF="290">be&s;ides light infantry and Cha&s;&s;eurs, of three batta|lions of grenadiers, and the regiments of Mirbach. The American force at Red Bank was e&s;timated about 800 men.</P>
<P>The di&s;po&s;itions for this attack have been repre&s;ent|ed as the mo&s;t ma&s;terly in their kind; and the valour and courage of the troops highly extolled; but not|with&s;tanding of all the vigour &s;hewn by our forces both by &s;ea and land, this enterprize failed of &s;uc|ce&s;s, and the 800 cowards in Red-Bank killed a thou&s;and of the brave&s;t troops in the world. Golo|nel Donop attacked the enemy's trenches with the utmo&s;t gallantry, and after a very &s;harp action carried an exten&s;ive out-work; but he found the enemy better covered in the body of the redoubt, and the defence more vigorous than he expected. Some have thought that the Americans &s;uffered him to en|ter the outwork on purpo&s;e, that they might prevent him from ever getting out again; and if this was their de&s;ign, they gained the point they had in view. For this brave colonel was there mortally wounded, and taken pri&s;oner; &s;everal of his be&s;t officers were killed, or di&s;abled; and the He&s;&s;ians after a de&s;perate engagement were repul&s;ed with great lo&s;s. Colonel Mingerede, the next in command, was al&s;o danger|ou&s;ly wounded, and the detachment was brought off by lieutenant colonel Lin&s;ing; having &s;uffered much in the approach to, and retreat from the attack, by the fire of the provincial gallies and floating bat|teries. The lo&s;s of the He&s;&s;ians on this occa&s;ion, was on this &s;ide the Atlantic, reduced to 500 men, but from the be&s;t imformation on the other &s;ide, it was determined to be a 1000, and not below 900 men. The&s;e German hirelings received the reward
<PB N="286" REF="291">of their &s;ervice on this occa&s;ion, and though they be|haved with great bravery, no per&s;on who con&s;iders their principles of action can lament their fall. For men to have hired them&s;elves to fight again&s;t the rights of human nature, degrades them beneath the very bea&s;ts of the field; courage and bravery engaged again&s;t virtue and liberty, is like the dragon and his angels fighting again&s;t Michael and his angels.</P>
<P>The attack by water was not more &s;ucce&s;sful than that which was made by land; the men of war and frigates, appointed for this attack, having pa&s;&s;ed with difficulty through the low barrier, took every po&s;&s;ible di&s;po&s;ition, that the nature and &s;ituation of the work could admit, for the de&s;truction of the upper works, and defences. But when all this was done, the &s;hips could not bring their fire to bear, &s;o as to do much injury to the works. The Americans had, by de&s;ign|ed ob&s;tructions, &s;o altered the cour&s;e and channel of the river, that the bed thereof was greatly changed from its natural cour&s;e. By this means the Augu&s;ta man of war and the Merlin &s;loop, were grounded &s;o fa&s;t, at a little di&s;tance from the chevaux de frize, that there remained not the &s;malle&s;t po&s;&s;ibility of getting them off. While they were in this &s;ituation they were in danger of being de&s;troyed by four fire-&s;hips, that were &s;ent down by the enemy, upon the Augu&s;ta. The effect of the&s;e fire-ve&s;&s;els was, however, prevent|ed by the activity of the &s;ailors; yet this was of little &s;ervice to the Augu&s;ta, which took fire in the engage|ment, and obliged the others to make all the ha&s;te they could to get out of the reach of the explo&s;ion. In the&s;e pre&s;&s;ing and difficult circum&s;tances, the Mer|lin was &s;peedily de&s;erted, and laid in a train of de|&s;truction; and the greater part of the officers and crew
<PB N="286" REF="292">of the Augu&s;ta were &s;aved. The &s;econd lieutenant, chaplain and gunner, and a very con&s;iderable part of the common men unhappily peri&s;hed. This is the fir&s;t time we have had occa&s;ion to meet with a chap|lain in the hi&s;tory of this war; and it is not ea&s;y to conceive of what &s;ervice any of that character can be, in carrying on &s;uch cruel and bloody tran&s;actions. Men who carry on an offen&s;ive war, either upon ab|&s;urd or doubtful principles, mu&s;t be very ignorant, to imagine that any creature like this that was unfor|tunately lo&s;t on this occa&s;ion, can, by any formal or occa&s;ional devotion, &s;anctify and action in it&s;elf immo|ral. If there was no other thing to bla&s;t the &s;ucce&s;s of a war, the improper and irreverent devotion that is paid to the Almighty, both by the chaplains and their audiences, is &s;ufficient to do it. There is no money wor&s;e &s;pent, than that which is laid out upon tho&s;e military officers called chaplains: They are in general more the patterns of vice than of virtue, and with re|gard to &s;ea chaplains, when the author of their in|&s;tallment is con&s;idered, there is not much good to be expected from them at pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>The bad &s;ucce&s;s of this enterprize, though it &s;tag|gered the confidence of the leaders of the war, yet it did not totally damp their re&s;olution; and nece&s;&s;ity, as well as a &s;en&s;e of military honour, &s;purred them on to make a new attempt to open the Delaware. Till this was done, all their former proceedings were as &s;o much vain labour, and fruitle&s;s toil; they therefore adopted new &s;chemes, pur&s;ued new mea&s;ures, and took other ground. Nor were the coloni&s;ts idle on their part, in preparing every ob&s;truction they could devi&s;e to render all the efforts of the fleet and army un&s;uc|ce&s;sful. They knew of what con&s;equence it was to
<PB N="288" REF="293">them, to keep the naval force &s;eparated from the army, and to render the communication between them tedious and difficult. They accordingly did all that they could to &s;trengthen their defences. Though they did not expect that they would be able to with|&s;tand the united force of the fleet and army, yet they knew that they could weaken them both with little da|mage to them&s;elves; which, upon the whole, would be &s;o much gain to them. After much preparation, and &s;evere labour, as well as imminent danger, the officers and &s;eamen conveyed &s;ome heavy artillery, provi&s;ions, and &s;tores up the river, by a different channel, on the We&s;t &s;ide, to a &s;mall mar&s;hy i&s;land, where they erected batteries, which greatly incommoded the works of the Americans. On the 13th of November every thing being prepared for the attack, the I&s;is and Somer&s;et men of war, pa&s;&s;ed up the Ea&s;t channel, in order to attack the provincial works in the front: &s;e|veral frigates drew up again&s;t a new fort which was erected on the Jer&s;ey &s;ide near Manto creek, which was &s;o &s;ituated as to flank the men of war in their &s;tations; and two armed ve&s;&s;els, mounted with 24 pounders, made their way through the narrow chan|nel on the we&s;t &s;ide, at the back of Hogg-I&s;land. This was a matter of the greate&s;t con&s;equence with regard to the &s;ucce&s;s of the attack, as the&s;e two ve&s;|&s;els in concert with the batteries newly erected in Province I&s;land, enfiladed the principal works which the provincials had erected upon Mud-I&s;land. An heavy fire was begun and maintained on both &s;ides, till the &s;hips of war and the armed ve&s;&s;els about night &s;ilenced the batteries on Mud I&s;land. The garri&s;on who under&s;tood that the utmo&s;t force of both army and navy would next morning be applied

<PB N="289" REF="295">to reduce the fort, &s;et fire to all their works in the night and retired. It was never known what lo&s;s the provincials &s;u&s;tained in the &s;everal a&s;&s;aults upon this fort; in our accounts their lo&s;s of men is &s;aid to have been con&s;iderable, and certainly they mu&s;t have &s;uffered &s;ome lo&s;s; but the whole troops that were in the fort were not equal in number to the half of the &s;lain, on the &s;ide of the royal forces. The lo&s;s of our fleet was not con&s;iderable, con&s;ider|ing the danger it was expo&s;ed to, though a great number were wounded, and &s;everal lo&s;t their lives on this occa&s;ion. The coloni&s;ts left &s;ome artillery and &s;tores, which fell into the hands of our troops. In a few days after Lord Cornwallis pa&s;&s;ed over with a de|tachment from Che&s;ter to Billings-Fort, where he was joined by a body of forces ju&s;t arrived from New-York. They marched all together to Red-Bank, which the provincials abandoned at their approach, leaving their artillery and &s;ome &s;tores behind them.</P>
<P>The American &s;hipping had now lo&s;t all protec|tion on either fide of the river; their gallies and other ve&s;&s;els took the advantage of a favourable night to pa&s;s the Barriers of Philadelphia, and e&s;caped to places of &s;ecurity farther up the river. To &s;ecure the&s;e an officer with a party of &s;eamen was ordered to man the Delaware frigate, which was lately taken and lying at Philadelphia, and to take &s;uch mea&s;ures as might prevent the remainder from e&s;caping. The crews of the American ve&s;&s;els finding them&s;elves &s;ur|rounded, &s;et fire to their &s;hips and left them. About &s;eventeen of different &s;orts, including two floating-batteries and fire-&s;hips, were all con&s;umed. After gaining all the&s;e advantages, the &s;ea&s;on of the year, and other ob&s;tructions, rendered the clearing of the river for any effectual purpo&s;es altogether impracti|cable,
<PB N="290" REF="296">&s;o that the making or di&s;covering &s;uch a chan|nel, as might admit of tran&s;ports or ve&s;&s;els of ea&s;y burden with provi&s;ions and nece&s;&s;aries for the u&s;e of the army, was all that could be obtained for the pre|&s;ent.</P>
<P>General Wa&s;hington was now reinforced with a recruit of 4000 men from the northern army, and advanced within 14 miles of Philadelphia, to a place called White March, where he encamped in a &s;trong &s;ituation, with his right to the Wi&s;&s;ahechon Creek, and his front partly covered by Sandy Run. This movement made General Howe imagine that he in|tended &s;ome enterprize, and that his late reinforce|ment would encourage him to hazard a battle for the recovery of Philadelphia. This was not at all his intention; he knew that his movement would &s;ugge&s;t this idea to General Howe, and make him draw out his army to field, which in the middle of winter would harra&s;s the troops, and di&s;tre&s;s both the men and officers. The Engli&s;h general imagined that either Wa&s;hington would give him battle, or that if he ob&s;erved his u&s;ual caution, there might be &s;ome vulnerable part in his camp, where he might be attacked with &s;ucce&s;s. For the&s;e rea&s;ons he marched his army on the 4th of December at night, and took po&s;t on Che&s;nut-hill, on the front of Wa&s;h|ington's camp on the next morning. Finding that their right afforded no opening for an attack, he changed his ground before day light upon the &s;eventh, and took a new &s;tation, oppo&s;ite to their centre and left. A few &s;kirmi&s;hes happened, in which the king's troops were the conquerors, who pur&s;ued the flying parties almo&s;t to their works. The general continued for three days con&s;tantly in their &s;ight, and advanced within a mile of their works; but when he had exa|mined
<PB N="291" REF="297">them with great attention, he found them inac|ce&s;&s;ible, and &s;o gave up his de&s;ign as entirely fruitle&s;s. The army &s;uffered greatly from the &s;everity of the weather, both officers and men being totally de&s;titute of tents and field accoutrements. Sir William Howe accordingly began his march to Philadelphia upon the 8th in full view of the enemy, who &s;uffered him to return as he came without gaining any one point ex|cept much toil and fatigue to the men and the officers. This, General Wa&s;hington fore&s;aw would be the con|&s;equence, and it was all that he intended by his move|ment; for he immediately removed his camp from White March to Valley Forge upon the Schuyl|kill, about 15 miles from Philadelphia, in a very &s;trong and &s;ecure &s;ituation.</P>
<P>General Howe, as the &s;ea&s;on was now too far ad|vanced to admit of any other attention except what related to the accommodation of the troops, &s;ent a grand detachment out to procure forage for the win|ter, which performed its purpo&s;e with &s;ucce&s;s. The Americans continued during the winter in huts in their camp, without returning to their homes, or going into winter quarters. This &s;hewed their great zeal for the cau&s;e they were engaged in, and the un|bounded influence which General Wa&s;hington had over the minds of the Americans. Thus ended the campaign upon the Delaware; a campaign, concern|ing which there have been &s;everal opinions, and which affords room for very &s;erious reflections. The Briti&s;h troops had been in general &s;ucce&s;sful, without gaining any advantage; for with all their victories, and the &s;trong tide of &s;ucce&s;s which was &s;aid to attend them, at the clo&s;e of the campaign the amount of all their labours and battles was &s;imply a good winter lodging in the city of Philadelphia; whil&s;t the troops po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed
<PB N="292" REF="298">no more of the adjacent country, than they immedi|ately commanded with their arms. Another di&s;cou|ragement attended the conclu&s;ion of this campaign, was, that though the coloni&s;ts might fight them when they had a mind, and with advantage to them&s;elves, it was impo&s;&s;ible for the royal army to bring them to an engagement again&s;t their will. This occa&s;ioned much unea&s;ine&s;s in England, among the promoters of this unrighteous war; who had been &s;o much elated with the news of the fir&s;t &s;ucce&s;&s;es, and had boa&s;ted in the mo&s;t extravagant manner. Gloomy reflections began now to crowd upon them, and guilt and di&s;appoint|ment greatly chagrined their minds. They began to find that victory and defeat were nearly attended with the &s;ame con&s;equences. The &s;ub&s;tance of the nation was wa&s;ted, its be&s;t blood was &s;pilt, yet &s;till there was nothing done. The American war was nearly in the &s;ame &s;tate that it was at the beginning, merely with this difference, that the coloni&s;ts were inured to war and could make a better defence. In the beginning of this year the mini&s;terial boa&s;ting run very high, concerning the marvellous things that General Howe would do in the &s;pring; and when they received the account of the defeat in the Jer&s;eys; the had fixed their hopes upon the atchievements which were to be performed by the northern army under General Burgoyne. We mu&s;t now leave Sir William Howe in his winter quarters in Philadelphia, and look back to the affairs of Canada and the Lakes.</P>
<P>In viewing the hi&s;tory of the &s;outhern campaign, we have beheld a train of victories without any equi|valent advantages, and heard of wonderful atchieve|ments without &s;o much as &s;eeing one province &s;ubdu|ed; a large fleet and a numerous army of the be&s;t
<PB N="293" REF="299">troops ever &s;ent over the Atlantic, confined in their operations to the defence of a &s;ingle city, without being able to &s;ecure two leagues of country for the &s;pace of a few days. The northern campaign was &s;till more un&s;ucce&s;sful; for there we meet with nothing except di&s;grace, defeat, and di&s;appointment. The war upon the &s;ide of Canada and the Lakes was com|mitted to Lieutenant General Burgoyne, an officer who&s;e abilities were unque&s;tioned, and who&s;e &s;pirit of enterprize, and thir&s;t for military glory, though it might be rivalled, could not po&s;&s;ibly be exceeded. It is &s;omewhat doubtful, notwith&s;tanding the prai&s;es that were lavi&s;hed upon that officer, whether his ca|pacity was adequate to the arduous undertaking he was now engaged in. The fertility of his imagina|tion, and the brilliancy of his fancy, &s;eem to have prevailed more in his character than &s;oundne&s;s of judgment, true caution, or penetration.</P>
<P>The appointment of General Burgoyne to this com|mand was far from being plea&s;ing to General Carleton and his friends; it gave great offence to the general, who by his good conduct pre&s;erved Quebec, defended Canada, and recovered Lake Champlain. He felt &s;everely the affront, that when he had brought mat|ters &s;o far forward, that the command &s;hould be taken from him and given to another, as if in&s;tead of having merited honour for his &s;ervices he had de&s;erved di&s;|grace, and mortification. It was &s;aid that his powers had been dimini&s;hed in proportion to the greatne&s;s of his &s;ervices. His military command before extend|ed to every part of America, wither he might find it nece&s;&s;ary to conduct the army under his command. It was now &s;uddenly re&s;trained to the narrow limits of his own province. His friends ob&s;erved that he
<PB N="294" REF="300">had in the preceding campaign, not only driven the enemy out of Canada, but had formed a great naval armament, and de&s;troyed the enemy's force upon Lake Champlain, recovered Crown Point, and put all things in that quarter in a fair way of &s;ucceeding the next campaign. That nothing prevented him from taking Ticonderago except the latene&s;s of the &s;ea&s;on, when he would have immediately pro&s;ecuted the war to the &s;outhward. He had, during the winter, applied his u&s;ual indu&s;try in forwarding every pre|paration which might promote the &s;ucce&s;s of the de|&s;ign in the en&s;uing campaign. When the &s;ea&s;on opened the communication with England, in&s;tead of the reinforcements he required, and expected for ful|filling of his purpo&s;e, he received an arrangment to|tally new, which was neither planned according to, nor was the execution in any degree left to his di&s;cre|tion. The mini&s;ter for the American department had formed the whole &s;cheme, and had proceeded &s;o far as to determine every detachment to be made from the larger bodies to be employed in two &s;eperate ex|peditions. General Carleton was not even con&s;ulted concerning the number and nature of the troops, which were to remain under his command for the de|fence and &s;ecurity of Canada. In a word, the army which he lately commanded was taken out of his hands, and placed under the command of officers who had lately acted under his authority, and placed in independent commands, and ordered to receive their in&s;tructions from Sir William Howe; which was no le&s;s than an open in&s;ult to Sir Guy Carleton, who had been already informed by General Howe, that the di&s;tance of their operations would prevent all commu|nication between them. The mini&s;ter on this occa|&s;ion
<PB N="295" REF="301">&s;hewed a real want of ability for directing &s;uch great and di&s;tant operations; he took for granted that he perceived the force of the enemy, and all the re&s;our&s;es which they might have to fru&s;trate his plan, when he did not &s;o much as con&s;ider the difficulties that even aro&s;e from the very nature of the country. With regard to the force of the coloni&s;ts in that quar|ter, neither the mini&s;ter, nor any of the commanders appear to have had the &s;malle&s;t information. Gene|rals and troops on a &s;udden &s;tarted up, that were never heard of, nor believed to exi&s;t till the very mo|ment of action; and a thou&s;and impediments were found to &s;tand in the way of this expedition, that the mini&s;ter never dreamed of, and which his genius never &s;ugge&s;ted to him.</P>
<P>Sir Guy Carlton, notwith&s;tanding the di&s;grace which the mini&s;ter had done him, behaved with a greatne&s;s of &s;oul which did him much honour. He &s;hewed, that though he was &s;en&s;ible of the affront which he had received, yet he knew how to pa&s;s over an injury, and did not &s;uffer any per&s;onal di&s;grace to hinder him from &s;erving his country, and what he conceived to be the public cau&s;e thereof. He applied him&s;elf with the &s;ame diligence and activity to forward by every po&s;&s;ible means, and to &s;upport in all its parts, the ex|pedition, as if it had been his contrivance and &s;olely his own plan. This conduct though it was what go|vernment did not de&s;erve from this officer, yet was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for carrying on the de&s;ign of this expedition; and though in the end it mi&s;gave, it was more owing to the management of General Carleton, that it proceeded &s;o far as it did, than to any good conduct of the mini&s;ter who formed the plan thereof. The arrangment was &s;o complicated, and the parts of
<PB N="296" REF="302">the expedition &s;o numerous, and many of them un|known in practice, that it was no wonder that it did not &s;ucceed. In all its parts it appeared to be the offspring of folly and the creature of madne&s;s. Carle|ton did all in his power to give it birth, and though he was not its parent he acted the part of a good nur&s;e, and withheld no a&s;&s;i&s;tance that was in his power to render it effectual.</P>
<P>The mini&s;ters at home and e&s;pecially the lord at the head of the American department were deeply intere&s;ted in the &s;ucce&s;s of this expedition; they had founded the mo&s;t &s;anguine expectations concerning it, and had in idea anticipated the glorious advantages that would be derived from it. Nothing was left un|done on their &s;ide, as far as their penetration could reach, to render it effectual. All things were pre|pared according to the number of troops that could be &s;pared for that particular &s;ervice, which were thought conducive to give efficacy to their operations. Canada was expected to afford a warlike though un|di&s;ciplined militia, well calculated for and acquainted with the nature and &s;ervice of the country. To &s;trengthen and increa&s;e this irregular force, arms and accoutrements were amply provided to &s;upply tho&s;e numerous loyali&s;ts, who were expected to join the royal army as &s;oon as it approached the frontiers of the&s;e provinces. A powerful artillery was provided to drive the rebels from all their po&s;ts and thickets; and it was con&s;idered as a thing impo&s;&s;ible that any number of irregular troops could &s;tand before &s;uch a well appointed army of veterans. In this particular the mini&s;try rea&s;oned falaciou&s;ly; for though the colo|ni&s;ts were not &s;uch old troops as &s;ome of the regi|ments which were &s;ent again&s;t them, they were far
<PB N="297" REF="303">from being irregular. They knew di&s;cipline and obeyed command, with great exactne&s;s, and were de|termined to venture their lives for the cau&s;e they were engaged in. And it was found upon trial that they were not &s;o ea&s;ily combated as Lord George Ger|maine and General Burgoyne had imagined.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the&s;e forces already mentioned, &s;everal na|tions of &s;avages had been induced to come into the field; a mea&s;ure which will fix an everla&s;ting di&s;grace upon the authors, and leave a blot upon the pre&s;ent reign, that nothing but the death of time it&s;elf will be able to wipe away. This mea&s;ure was defended by mini&s;terial advocates upon the &s;uppo&s;ed nece&s;&s;ity of the ca&s;e: as if from the character of the Indians it were manife&s;t that they could not be &s;till, and if not engaged in the king's &s;ervice, would join the Americans. This was a vain and fal&s;e apprehen&s;ion; for the colo|ni&s;ts had already refu&s;ed their &s;ervice, and they had agreed to &s;tand neuter, and live quietly. It was only the pre&s;ents given them by mini&s;terial agents, who wanted them to attend the army for the purpo&s;es of &s;calping and murder, that induced them to take up the hatchet. General Carleton would not employ them, but in the preceding year civilly di&s;mi&s;&s;ed them; his humanity would not permit him to make u&s;e of &s;uch illicit in&s;truments of war, and as his orders were not &s;o particularly expre&s;s on that head, he made no u&s;e of their &s;ervice. But now a more high and per|emptory authority po&s;itively enjoined the making u&s;e of them; and it was &s;uppo&s;ed to be one of the favo|rite and mo&s;t enchanting &s;chemes of that authority, to bring forth tho&s;e barbarians to the field, for the &s;ake of glutting its revenge upon the refractory colo|ni&s;ts. It will hardly be credited in after ages, that
<PB N="298" REF="304">in a reign marked &s;o often with the epithet <HI>pious,</HI> that an order &s;hould ever have come forth with the royal &s;anction, to let loo&s;e &s;avage barbarians upon helple&s;s old men, women, and children. Whatever were the rea&s;ons why General Carleton did not employ the &s;avages in a more early and effectual manner, they were far from giving &s;atisfaction to mini&s;try, and their friends at home. It was in&s;i&s;ted that every appear|ance of lenity was actual cruelty in the effect, becau&s;e it operated as an incentive to di&s;obedience, and in|crea&s;ed the objects of puni&s;hment. That on the con|trary, partial &s;everity was general mercy; as timely exertions of ju&s;tice, and &s;trict inflictions of puni&s;h|ments, were at all times the &s;ure means of preventing crimes. That the only method of &s;peedily cru&s;hing the rebellion, was to render the &s;ituation of the actors in it, &s;o intolerable, that a ce&s;&s;ation from danger and ble&s;&s;ings of repo&s;e, &s;hould become the only objects of their contemplation and hope. That the means were but little to be attended to, when they led to the accompli&s;hment of &s;o great and happy a purpo&s;e as the de&s;truction of rebellion, and the re&s;toration of order and legal government. And in all convul&s;ions of &s;tates the innocent were but two frequently involv|ed in the calamities which were intended for the guilty; but &s;uch was the lot and condition of man|kind, and this evil however much deplored, could not in numberle&s;s in&s;tances be prevented. This doc|trine was &s;upported by the avowed friends of the mini&s;try, whether out of office, or in the &s;ubordinate departments of the &s;tate; and it was undoubtedly agreeable to the opinions of the mini&s;ters, and &s;hewed that General Carleton's &s;cruples with regard to em|ploying the &s;avages, were in no re&s;pect acceptable to them.</P>
<PB N="299" REF="305">
<P>The arguments made u&s;e of to &s;upport this doc|trine, were all founded in the fir&s;t in&s;tance, upon the mo&s;t palpable fal&s;hoods; for they all take for granted what never was nor can be proved, namely, that the coloni&s;ts were in a &s;tate of rebellion according to the fundamental laws of the Briti&s;h con&s;titution. There were no laws exi&s;ting at the time the controver&s;y be|gan, that determined an oppo&s;ition to uncon&s;titution|al acts of parliament, rebellion. It could not there|fore be an exertion of ju&s;tice, to employ &s;avages to inforce new arbitrary &s;tatutes, which were contrary to the very genius of the con&s;titution. According to the&s;e court advocates, it would have been equally ju&s;t to have employed barbarians to have prevented the revolution, or it is &s;till ju&s;t to emply them to over|turn its principles. Before they had endeavour|ed to cru&s;h a rebellion with all the cruelty of &s;avage barbarity, they ought fir&s;t to have enquired whether it exi&s;ted, and whether, what they &s;o called, was not created by them&s;elves. Legal government con&s;i&s;ts in ob&s;erving the con&s;titutional laws of the empire, and not in pur&s;uing modern &s;tatues, which are dia|metrically oppo&s;ite to the fir&s;t principles of our fun|damental laws. To make acts of power through the influence of corruption in the legi&s;lature, that infringe the liberties and the natural rights of the &s;ubjects, and then to determine it rebellion to re&s;i&s;t them, is the &s;ame thing as to declare the whole code of fundamental &s;tatutes, rebellious acts, and the framers of them traitors. It would require no more to prove this point, than only to place the old laws of the land and &s;ome modern &s;tatutes in oppo&s;ite co|lumns. But it was no wonder, that the promoters of this war were not very nice concerning the means
<PB N="300" REF="306">they made u&s;e of, &s;eeing they had adopted the popi&s;h maxims, that the end &s;anctifies the means. After generations, when they read the hi&s;tory of this war, will be equally a&s;toni&s;hed, both at the end and the means made u&s;e of to attain it. It is a very curious maxim, that partial &s;everity is general mercy, e&s;pe|cially when it is con&s;idered that both the guilt and the mi&s;ery proceed from tho&s;e that now pretended to have a right to puni&s;h. It was &s;uch mercy as it would be to take away the lives of &s;o many innocent people that the re&s;t may be fitter to be made &s;laves.</P>
<P>However much Sir Guy Carleton di&s;approved of making u&s;e of the &s;avages, he was now obliged by a &s;pecial authority to u&s;e his influence to bring them over to the mea&s;ures of government: accordingly pre&s;ents were liberally di&s;tributed among them, which an&s;wered the purpo&s;e intended. The regular force appointed to this expedition, conducted by General Burgoyne, con&s;i&s;ted of Briti&s;h and German troops, to the number of near 8000; of the&s;e 3217 were Brun&s;wickers; watermen and artillery made a corps of about 2000, and the &s;avages about 1200.</P>
<P>Canada was largely rated, and the inhabitants greviou&s;ly oppre&s;&s;ed: they felt &s;en&s;ibly the propor|tion which they were appointed to furni&s;h towards this campaign. In the propo&s;als laid before the mi|ni&s;ter, be&s;ides the militia and various other kinds of workmen, &s;uppo&s;ed nece&s;&s;ary to be immediately at|tached to the army, and to accompany it on the ex|pedition, chains of the militia, patroles, and po&s;ts, were expected to occupy the woods in the frontiers in the rear of the army, partly to intercept the com|munication between the enemy and the ill-affected in Canada, partly to prevent de&s;ertion, and to procure
<PB N="301" REF="307">intelligence, and for various other exigencies which might contribute to keep the country quiet. There was another great call upon them for workmen to compleat the fortifications at Sorrel, St Johns, Cham|blee, and the i&s;le of Noix, which it was &s;uppo&s;ed, would amount to 2000 men. But a &s;till greater call upon the Canadians, and the more grievous as it was at their feeding &s;ea&s;on, was for the tran&s;port of all provi&s;ions, artillery, &s;tores, and baggage of the army, from the different repo&s;itories to the water, and af|terwards at the carrying places, be&s;ide the corves for making the roads. It was e&s;timated that their &s;ervice would for &s;ome time before, and at the open|ing of the campaign, require no fewer than 2000 men, be&s;ides a very large proportion of hor&s;es and carts. The mini&s;try certainly did not make a fair e&s;timate of the profit and lo&s;s that would ari&s;e to the empire in pur&s;uing this expedition: for &s;uppo&s;e all things had &s;ucceeded according to their wi&s;hes, and they had been able to &s;ubdue all the colonies, the de&s;truction made in the mean time would not have again been made up for ages to come, nor would the money expended ever again be put into a circulation for the common advantage of the community. This war has been a war founded in mini&s;terial vengeance and ambition, without having &s;o much as a &s;ingle principle, or one object of common utility in its com|plexion. The friends and foes of government have both &s;uffered, and would have &s;uffered &s;uppo&s;e they had united in &s;upporting their mea&s;ures without the lea&s;t war or oppo&s;ition. Had all the Briti&s;h empire join|ed mutually in &s;upporting the &s;chemes of the pre&s;ent mini&s;try, without a di&s;&s;enting voice, and the mea&s;ures had been pur&s;ued for half a century, there would
<PB N="302" REF="308">have been very little difference between the inhabi|bitants of that empire, and the Indian &s;avages. The tendency of the whole of this admini&s;tration has been to depre&s;s the &s;pirit of liberty which is the &s;oul of true greatne&s;s, without which neither commerce, arts, or &s;ciences ever flouri&s;hed.</P>
<P>General Burgoyne, who was now at the head of this expedition, was a&s;&s;i&s;ted by able and excellent officers. Of the&s;e were Major General Philips of the artillery, who had acquired much honour by his conduct in the late war in Germany. He had like|wi&s;e under him Brigadier General Frazer, Powel, and Hamilton, all officers who had di&s;tingui&s;hed them|&s;elves in former &s;ervices; and with the&s;e the Brun&s;|wick Major General Baron Reide&s;el, and Brigadier General Specht. The army was in every re&s;pect in the be&s;t condition that could po&s;&s;ibly be expected or de&s;ired, the troops being, in the &s;tile of the army, in high &s;pirits, admirably di&s;ciplined and very healthy.</P>
<P>An expedition was determined to the Mohawk river, and Colonel St Ledger was appointed to the command thereof. The troops employed in this ex|pedition from the army were about 7 or 800, con|&s;i&s;ting of 200 drawn from the 8th and 34th regi|ments, a regiment of the New-Yorkers, lately rai&s;ed by Sir John John&s;on, being chiefly emigrants from his own country adjoining to the intended &s;cene of action, with &s;ome Hanau Cha&s;&s;eurs, a company of Ca|nadians, and another of newly rai&s;ed rangers. The&s;e were joined by a &s;trong body of Savages, in part con|ducted, or more properly commanded by officers from Britain and America. The regular force left in Canada, including the Highland emigrants under that denomination, amounted to about 3700 men.</P>
<PB N="303" REF="309">
<P>The army being at length arrived and encamped at the River Bouquet, on the we&s;t &s;ide of Lake Champlain, and at no very great di&s;tance to the north|ward of Crown Point, General Burgoyne, there met the Indians in congre&s;s, and afterwards, in compli|ance with the cu&s;toms of tho&s;e people, gave them a war fea&s;t. The &s;peech which he made to the &s;avages upon this occa&s;ion has been publi&s;hed. It was cal|culated, in tho&s;e powerful &s;trains of elocution by which that gentleman is di&s;tingui&s;hed, to excite their ardour in the common cau&s;e, and at the &s;ame time to repre&s;s their barbarity. For this purpo&s;e he took pains in explaining to them the di&s;tinction between a war carried on again&s;t a common enemy, in which the whole country and people were ho&s;tile, and the pre|&s;ent, in which good and faithful &s;ubjects were largely, and of nece&s;&s;ity, intermixed with rebels and traitors. Upon this principle he laid down &s;everal injunctions for the government of their conduct, particularly, that they &s;hould only kill tho&s;e who were oppo&s;ed to them in arms; that old men, women, children, and pri&s;oners &s;hould be held &s;acred from the knife or hatchet, even in the heat of actual conflict; that they &s;hould only &s;calp tho&s;e whom they had &s;lain in fair oppo&s;ition; but that under no pretence, &s;ubtlety, or colour of prevarication, they &s;hould &s;calp the wound|ed, or even dying; much le&s;s kill per&s;ons in that con|dition, by way of evading the injunction. And they were promi&s;ed a compen&s;ation for pri&s;oners, but in|formed that they &s;hould be called to an account for &s;calps. The&s;e endeavours did in &s;ome mea&s;ure miti|gate, but were not of force wholly to re&s;train their ferocity, of which &s;ome unhappy in&s;tances after|wards appeared.</P>
<PB N="304" REF="310">
<P>By the mo&s;t favourable account of this matter which has ju&s;t now been given from a very impartial authority, it appears that the &s;avages were to be paid both for their pri&s;oners and &s;calps, only they were to be called to an account for the latter. But it does not &s;eem a matter very clear how they were to be brought to an account, or how the general was to know the difference between a &s;calp taken from the head of one that was already dead, and one that was alive when &s;calped. They were to &s;calp tho&s;e only whom they had &s;lain in fair oppo&s;ition, but this was a matter not ea&s;ily to be decided, and the proclama|tion that followed &s;oon after this &s;peech, &s;eems to hint that &s;calps of all &s;orts might be taken from the heads of tho&s;e de&s;cribed in the proclamation. Gene|ral Burgoyne's arguments and the colouring be gives to the cau&s;e and characters of the Americans, imply that their could be very &s;mall offence in the Indians proceeding to extremities. The horrible denounci|ations of war dre&s;t in the mo&s;t formidable and terrific &s;hapes again&s;t tho&s;e who per&s;i&s;ted in ho&s;tility, but too plainly hinted, how agreeable Indian barbarity was to the commander in chief.</P>
<P>The General &s;oon after di&s;per&s;ed a manife&s;to, cal|culated to &s;pread terror among the contumacious, and particularly to revive in their minds every latent impre&s;&s;ion of fear, derived from knowledge or infor|mation of the cruel operations of the &s;avages, who&s;e numbers were accordingly magnified, and their eager|ne&s;s to be let loo&s;e to their prey, de&s;cribed with un|common energy. The force of that great power, which was now &s;pread by &s;ea and land, to embrace or to cru&s;h every part of America, was di&s;played in full, lofty, and expre&s;&s;ive language. The rebellion,
<PB N="305" REF="311">with its effects, and the conduct of the pre&s;ent gover|nors and governments, were charged with the high|e&s;t colouring, and exhibited a mo&s;t hideous picture, of unparalleled inju&s;tice, cruelty, per&s;ecution and ty|ranny. Encouragement and employment were a&s;|&s;ured to tho&s;e, who with a di&s;po&s;ition and ability &s;uit|ed to the purpo&s;e, &s;hould actually a&s;&s;i&s;t in redeeming their country from &s;lavery, and in the re-e&s;tabli&s;h|ment of legal government. Protection and &s;ecurity, clogged with conditions, re&s;tricted by circum&s;tances, and rather imperfectly or inexplicitly expre&s;&s;ed, were held out to the peaceable and indu&s;trious, who con|tinued in their habitations. And all the calamities and outrages of war, arrayed in their mo&s;t terrific forms, were denounced again&s;t tho&s;e who per&s;evered in their ho&s;tility.</P>
<P>The army having made a &s;hort &s;tay at Crown Point, for the e&s;tabli&s;hment of magazines, and ho&s;pital, and other nece&s;&s;ary &s;ervices, proceeded, in concert with the naval armament, to inve&s;t Ticonderoga, which was the fir&s;t object of their de&s;tination. Although the ra&s;h and ill conducted attempt made upon that place in the year 1758, with the con&s;equent repul&s;e and heavy lo&s;s &s;u&s;tained by the Briti&s;h army, render|ed it at that time an object of general attention, it may not at this di&s;tance of time be wholly unnece&s;|&s;ary to take &s;ome notice of its &s;ituation, as well as of its &s;tate of defence.</P>
<P>Ticonderoga lies on the we&s;tern &s;hore, and only a few miles to the northward from the commencement of that narrow inlet, by which the water from Lake George is conveyed to Lake Champlain. Crown Point lies about a dozen miles farther north at the extremity of that inlet. The fir&s;t of the&s;e places is
<PB N="306" REF="312">&s;ituated on an angle of land, which is &s;urrounded on three &s;ides by water, and that covered by rocks. A great part of the fourth &s;ide was covered by a deep mora&s;s, and where that fails, the old French lines &s;till continued as a defence on the north-we&s;t quarter. The Americans &s;trengthened the&s;e lines with addi|tional works and a blockhou&s;e. They had other po&s;ts with works and blockhou&s;es, on the left, to|wards Lake George. To the right of the French lines they had al&s;o two new blockhou&s;es with other works.</P>
<P>On the ea&s;tern &s;hore of the inlet, and oppo&s;ite to Ticonderoga, the Americans had taken &s;till more pains in fortifying a high circular hill to which they gave the name of Mount Independence. On the &s;ummit of this, which is Tableland, they had erected a &s;tar fort, enclo&s;ing a large &s;quare of barracks, well fortified and &s;upplied with artillery. The foot of the mountain, which on the we&s;t &s;ide projected into the water, was &s;trongly entrenched to its edge, and the entrenchment well lined with heavy artillery. A battery about half way up the mount, &s;u&s;tained and covered the&s;e lower works.</P>
<P>The Americans, with their u&s;ual indu&s;try, had join|ed the&s;e two po&s;ts by a bridge of communication thrown over the inlet. This was like many other of their performances, a great and mo&s;t laborious work. The bridge was &s;upported in 22 &s;unk piers of very large timber, placed at nearly equal di&s;tances; the &s;paces between the&s;e were filled with &s;eparate floats, each about fifty feet long and twelve feet wide, &s;trongly fa&s;tened together with chains and rivers, and as effectually attached to the &s;unk pillars. On the Lake Champlain &s;ide of the bridge, it was defended
<PB N="307" REF="313">by a boom compo&s;ed of very large pieces of timber, fa&s;tened together by rivetted bolts and double chains, made of iron an inch and half &s;quare. Thus not only a communication was maintained between the&s;e two po&s;ts, but all acce&s;s by water from the northern &s;ide was totally cut off.</P>
<P>It is to be ob&s;erved, that as the inlet immediately after pa&s;&s;ing Ticonderoga, a&s;&s;umes a new form, &s;ud|denly widening to a con&s;iderable breadth, and be|coming navigable to ve&s;&s;els of burden, &s;o from thence it al&s;o holds the name of Champlain, although it is not yet properly a part of the lake. On the other hand, the &s;outhern gut from Lake George, be&s;ides being narrow, is al&s;o rendered unnavigable by &s;hal|lows and falls; but on its arrival at Ticonderoga, it is joined by a great body of water on the ea&s;tern &s;ide, called, in this part, South River, but higher up to|wards its &s;ource, before the junction of the elder branch with the younger, which runs from South Bay, it is known under the appellation of Wood Creek. The confluence of the&s;e waters at Ticonde|roga, forms a &s;mall bay to the &s;outhward of the bridge of communication, and the point of land form|ed by their junction, is compo&s;ed of a mountain called Sugar Hill.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the apparent &s;trength of Ticon|deroga from what we have hitherto &s;een, it is entire|ly overlooked, and its works effectually commanded by Sugar Hill. This circum&s;tance occa&s;ioned a con|&s;ultation among the Americans as to the fortifying of that Mount; but their works were already far too exten&s;ive for their powers of defence, and would re|quire ten or twelve thou&s;and men to be effectually manned. It was likewi&s;e hoped, that the difficulty
<PB N="308" REF="314">of acce&s;s to the Sugar Mount, and the rugged in|equality of its &s;urface, would prevent the enemy from attempting to profit of its &s;ituation.</P>
<P>It would be exceedingly difficult from the informa|tion before us, to form any authentic e&s;timate of the number of Americans that were in the actual defence of the&s;e two po&s;ts. It appears by the commander in chief, General St. Clair's exculpatory letter to the congre&s;s, as well as by the re&s;olutions of the council of war, which accompanies it, that his whole force, including 900 militia, who were to quit him in a few days, was only about 3000 men; that the&s;e were ill equipped, and wor&s;e armed; particularly in the ar|ticle of bayonets, an arm &s;o e&s;&s;ential in the defence of lines, that they had not one in ten of their number.&mdash; This account would &s;eem not only &s;atisfactory but conclu&s;ive, if it had not been contradicted by others. In a detail of the tran&s;actions of the campaign, tran&s;|mitted by the war office of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts Bay to the American deputies in France, and for the conveyance of which a light &s;hip was &s;ent out on purpo&s;e, they &s;tate St. Clair's force at near 5000 men well equip|ped and armed. It is, however, to be ob&s;erved, that they talk with great bitterne&s;s of the General's con|duct, as he had done in his fir&s;t letter to congre&s;s, with re&s;pect to the behaviour of two of their regiments. It may al&s;o be &s;uppo&s;ed, that in a &s;tatement of their affairs intended to operate upon the &s;entiments and conduct of a court, from which they already received e&s;&s;ential benefits, and looked forward to much great|er, they would rather increa&s;e the weight of blame upon an unfortunate officer, than detract from the public opinion of their own conduct and power, by at|tributing weakne&s;s to their councils, or inefficacy to their arms.</P>
<PB N="309" REF="315">
<P>As the royal army approached to the object of its de&s;tination, it advanced with equal caution and order on both &s;ides of the lake, the naval force keeping its &s;tation in the centre, until the one had begun to en|clo&s;e the enemy on the land &s;ide, and the frigates and gun-boats ca&s;t anchor ju&s;t out of cannon-&s;hot from their works. Upon the near approach of the right wing on the Ticonderago &s;ide, upon the 2d of July, the Americans immediately abandoned and &s;et fire to their works, block-hou&s;es, and &s;aw-mills, towards Lake George, and without &s;ally, interpo&s;ition, or the &s;malle&s;t motion of diver&s;ion, permitted Major-General Philips to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the very advantageous po&s;t of Mount Hope, which be&s;ides commanding their lines in a great and dangerous degree, totally cut off all their communication with that lake. The &s;ame &s;upinene&s;s and total want of vigour appeared in every thing on their &s;ide, except in the keeping up of an ineffectual roar of cannon, which was &s;o much con|temned on the other as not to be once returned.</P>
<P>In the mean while, the royal army proceeded with &s;uch expedition in the con&s;truction of its works, the bringing up of artillery, &s;tores and provi&s;ions, and the e&s;tabli&s;hments of its po&s;ts and communications, that by the 5th, matters were &s;o far advanced, as to re|quire little more time for compleatly inve&s;ting the po&s;ts on both &s;ides of the lake. Sugar Hill was al&s;o examined, and the advantages it pre&s;ented were &s;o important, though attended with infinite labour and difficulty, from the nece&s;&s;ity of making a road $o its top through very rough ground, and con&s;tructing a level there for a battery, that this arduous ta&s;k was undertaken, and already far advanced towards its
<PB N="310" REF="316">completion, through the &s;pirit, judgment, and active indu&s;try of General Phllips.</P>
<P>In the&s;e circum&s;tances, a ha&s;ty council was on that day held by the American Generals, to which their principal went, as he informs us, already predeter|mined as to his conduct. It was repre&s;ented, that their whole effective numbers were not &s;ufficient to man one half of the works; that as the whole mu&s;t be con&s;equently upon con&s;tant duty, it would be impo&s;|&s;ible for them to &s;u&s;tain the fatigue for any length of time; and that as the enemy's batteries were ready to open, and the place would be completely inve&s;ted on all &s;ides within twenty-four hours, nothing could &s;ave the troops but an immediate evacuation of both po&s;ts. This determination was unanimou&s;ly agreed to by the council, and the place was accordingly eva|cuated on that night.</P>
<P>However ju&s;tly this repre&s;entation of their condi|tion and circum&s;tance was founded, and however ne|ce&s;&s;ary the determination of the council was in ths pre|&s;ent &s;tate of their a&s;iairs, one apparently capital error on the &s;ide of the commanders, mu&s;t &s;trike every common ob&s;erver. If their force was not &s;ufficient for the defence of the work, why did they not form this re&s;olution in time? Why did they not withdraw the troops, artillery, and &s;tores, and demoli&s;h the works before the arrival of the enemy? Why did they wait to be nearly &s;urrounded, until their retreat was more ruinous than a &s;urrender under any condi|tions that could be propo&s;ed, and little le&s;s de&s;tructive in the event, than if the works had been carried by &s;torm?</P>
<P>The&s;e are que&s;tions that time and better informa|tion alone can an&s;wer, if ever they &s;hould clearly an|&s;wer, in favour of the American Generals.</P>
<PB N="311" REF="317">
<P>The baggage of the army, with &s;uch artillery, &s;tores, and provi&s;ions, as the nece&s;&s;ity of the time would permit, were embarked with a &s;trong detach|ment on board above 200 batteaux, and di&s;patched, under convoy of five armed gallies, up the &s;outh river, in their way to Skene&s;borough. The main army took its route by the way of Ca&s;tletown to reach the &s;ame place by land.</P>
<P>July 6. The fir&s;t light of the morning had no &s;oon|er di&s;covered the flight of the enemy, than their main body was eagerly pur&s;ued by Brigadier General Fra|zer, at the head of his brigade, con&s;i&s;ting of the light troops, grenadiers, and &s;ome other corps. Major-General Reide&s;el was al&s;o ordered to join in the pur|&s;uit by land, with the greater part of the Brun&s;wick troops, either to &s;upport the Brigadier, or to act &s;e|parately, as occa&s;ion might require, or circum&s;tances direct. The enemy left a prodigious artillery behind them, which with tho&s;e taken or de&s;troyed in the ar|med ve&s;&s;els at Skene&s;borough, amounted to no le&s;s than 128 pieces, of all &s;orts, &s;erviceable and un&s;er|viceable. They al&s;o left &s;ome military &s;tores of dif|ferent &s;orts, and no incon&s;iderable &s;tock of provi&s;ions in the forts.</P>
<P>General Burgoyne conducted the pur&s;uit by water in per&s;on. That bridge and tho&s;e works, which the Americans laboured hard for ten months to render impenetrable, were cut through in le&s;s time by the Briti&s;h &s;eamen and artificers, than it would have co&s;t them to have de&s;cribed their &s;tructure. In a word, they did their bu&s;ine&s;s with &s;uch &s;peed and effect, that not only the gun boats, but the Royal George and Inflexible frigates, had pa&s;&s;ed through the bridge by nine o'clock in the morning. Several regiments
<PB N="312" REF="318">embarked on board the ve&s;&s;els, and the pur&s;uit up the river was &s;upported with &s;uch vigour, that by three o'clock in the afternoon, the foremo&s;t brigade of the gun-boats, was clo&s;ely engaged with the enemies gal|lies near Skene&s;borough Falls. In the mean time, three regiments which had been landed at South. Bay, a&s;cended and pa&s;&s;ed a mountain with great ex|pedition, in order to attack the enemy's works at the Falls, and thereby cut off their retreat. But their &s;peedy flight prevented the execution of their de&s;ign. Upon the approach of the frigates, the gallies, which were already overborne by the gun boats, lo&s;t all &s;pirit; two of them were accordingly taken, and three blown up. The rebels now giving way to their de&s;pair, &s;et fire to their works, &s;tockaded forts, mills, and batteaux, after which they e&s;caped as well as they could up the Wood Creek. This &s;troke &s;eemed to complete the ruin of their ill-fated army, for their batteaux were deeply loaded, be&s;ides their baggage, with ammunition, &s;tores, and provi&s;ions; &s;o that they were now left naked in the woods, de&s;titute of pro|vi&s;ion, and without any other means of defence, than what they derived from the arms in their hands.</P>
<P>Confu&s;ion and di&s;may, equally attended their main body on the left. The &s;oldiers had lo&s;t all re&s;pect for, and confidence in their commanders. It would be fruitle&s;s to expect re&s;olution, where no order nor command could be maintained.</P>
<P>Brigadier Frazer continued and &s;upported the chace through the vehement heat of a burning day, with his u&s;ual activity and vigour. Having received intel|ligence that the enemy's rear were at no great di&s;tance and were commanded by Colonel Francis one of their be&s;t and brave&s;t officers, his troops lay that night on
<PB N="313" REF="319">their arms. He came up with the enemy, on the 7th, at five in the morning, whom he found &s;trongly po&s;t|ed, with great advantage of ground, and a &s;till great|er &s;uperiority in point of number. As he expected every moment to be joined by General Reid&s;el, and was apprehen&s;ive that the enemy might e&s;cape if he delayed, he did not he&s;itate to begin the attack.&mdash; The advantages which they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in ground and number, and perhaps more than both, the goodne&s;s of their commander, induced them to make a better &s;tand than might have been expected from their condition in other re&s;pects.</P>
<P>As Frazer's corps was not &s;upported near &s;o &s;oon as had been expected, the engagement was long;&mdash; and though the light infantry and grenadiers gave &s;e|veral &s;triking proofs of their &s;uperiority, affairs were &s;till undecided and critical. The arrival of the Ger|mans was at length decicive. The enemy fled on all &s;ides, leaving their brave commander, with many o|ther officers, and about 200 private men, dead on the field. About the &s;ame number, be&s;ides a colonel, &s;e|ven Captains, and ten Subalterns were taken pri&s;on|ers. Above 600 were &s;uppo&s;ed to be wounded, ma|ny of whom peri&s;hed mi&s;erably in the woods. The principal lo&s;s on the &s;ide of the royal army, was that of Major Grant, a brave officer, who was killed.&mdash; St. Clair, with the van of the American army, was at this time at Ca&s;tletown, about &s;ix miles farther on.&mdash; Upon the account of this di&s;a&s;ter, and of the more fa|tal &s;troke at Skene&s;borough, and under the appre|hen&s;ion of being intercepted at Fort Anne, he &s;truck on to the woods on his left, probably uncertain whe|ther he &s;hould direct his cour&s;e towards the New
<PB N="314" REF="320">England provinces, and the upper part of Connec|ticut, or to Fort Edward.</P>
<P>During the&s;e advantages on the left, Colonel Hill was detached with the 9th regiment from Skene&s;bo|rough towards Fort Anne, in order to intercept the fugitives who fled along the Wood Creek, whil&s;t ano|ther part of the army was employed in carrying bat|teaux over the falls, in order to facilitate their move|ment to di&s;lodge the enemy from that po&s;t. In that expedition, the Colonel was attacked by a body of the enemy, con&s;i&s;ting, as he conceived, of &s;ix times the number of his detachment, who finding all their ef|forts in front ineffectual to force the judicious po&s;i|tion which he had taken, attempted to &s;urround the regiment. This alarming attempt put him under the nece&s;&s;ity of changing his ground in the heat of action. Nothing le&s;s than the mo&s;t perfect di&s;cipline, &s;upport|ed by the coole&s;t intrepidity, could have enabled the regiment to execute &s;o critical a movement in the face of the enemy, and in &s;uch circum&s;tances. It was however performed with &s;uch &s;teadine&s;s and effect, that the enemy, after an attack of three hours, were &s;o totally repul&s;ed, and with &s;uch lo&s;s, that after &s;et|ting fire to Fort Anne, they fled with the utmo&s;t pre|cipitation towards Fort Edward, upon the Hud&s;on's river.</P>
<P>The lo&s;s of the royal army, in all this &s;ervice, and in &s;o many different engagements, &s;ome of which were warm, and &s;eemed liable to lo&s;s, was very &s;mall.&mdash; The whole in killed and wounded, not much exceed|ing two hundred men.</P>
<P>Such was the rapid torrent of &s;ucce&s;s, which &s;wept every thing away before the northern army in its out|&s;et. It is not to be wondered at, if both officers and
<PB N="315" REF="321">private men were highly elevated with their fortune, and deemed that and their prowe&s;s to be irre&s;i&s;table, if they regarded their enemy with the greate&s;t con|tempt, con&s;idered their own toils to be nearly at an end, Albany to be already in their hands; and the re|duction of the northern provinces to be rather a mat|ter of &s;ome time, than an ardous ta&s;k full of difficulty and danger.</P>
<P>At home, the joy and exultation was extreme; not only at court, but with all tho&s;e who hoped or wi&s;hed the unqualified &s;ubjugation, and the unconditional &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion of the colonies. The lo&s;s in reputation was greater to the Americans, and capable of more fa|tal con&s;equences, than even that of ground, or po&s;ts, of artillery, or of men. All the contemptuous and mo&s;t degrading charges which had been made by their enemies, of their wanting the re&s;olution and abilities of men, even in the defence of whatever was dear to them, were now repeated and believed. Tho&s;e who &s;till regarded them as men, and who had not yet lo&s;t all affection to them as brethren,; who al&s;o retained hopes that a happy reconciliation upon con&s;titution|al principles, without &s;acrificing the dignity, or the ju&s;t authority of government on the one &s;ide, or a derelic|tion of the rights of freemen on the other, was not even now impo&s;&s;ible, notwith&s;tanding their favourable di&s;po&s;itions in general, could not help feeling upon this occa&s;ion, that the Americans &s;unk not a little in their e&s;timation. It was not difficult to diffu&s;e an opinion, that the war in effect was over; and that any further re&s;i&s;tance would &s;erve only to render the terms of their &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion the wor&s;e. Such were &s;ome of the immediate effects of the lo&s;s of tho&s;e grand keys of North America, Ticonderago, and the lakes.</P>
<PB N="316" REF="322">
<P>The Americans were in this &s;tile degraded both by the tories and others, who were either lukewarm in the cau&s;e of liberty, or from &s;elfi&s;h con&s;iderations wi&s;h|ed a total reduction of the colonies. But the tri|umphing of the wicked is &s;hort; matters were not long in taking a retrogade turn, and all this triumph was changed into &s;orrow and mourning.</P>
<P>General Burgoyne continued for &s;ome days with the army partly at Skene&s;borough, and partly &s;pread in the adjoining country. They were under the ne|ce&s;&s;ity of waiting for the arrival of tents, baggage, and provi&s;ions. In the mean time, no labour was &s;pared in opening roads by the way of Fort Anne, for ad|vancing again&s;t the enemy. Equal indu&s;try was u&s;ed in clearing the Wood Creek from the ob&s;tacles of fal|len trees, &s;unken &s;tones, and other impediments which had been laid in the way by the enemy, in order to o|pen a pa&s;&s;age for batteaux, for the conveyan&ccedil;e of artil|lery, &s;tores, provi&s;ions, for camp equipage. Nor was le&s;s diligence u&s;ed at Ticonderago, in the carrying of gun boats, provi&s;ions, ve&s;&s;els, and batteaux, over land into Lake George. The&s;e were all laborious works, but the &s;pirit of the army was at that time &s;uperior to toil or danger.</P>
<P>General Schuyler was at Fort Edward upon the Hud&s;on's river, where he was endeavouring to collect the militia, and had been joined by St. Clair with the wretched remains of his army, who had taken a round about march of &s;even days through the woods, in which, from the exceeding badne&s;s of the weather, with the want of covering provi&s;ions, and all manner of nece&s;&s;aries, they had &s;uffered the mo&s;t extreme mi|&s;ery. Many others of the fugitives had al&s;o arrived, but &s;o totally broken down, that they were nearly as
<PB N="317" REF="323">de&s;titute of arms, ammunition, and all the materials of war, as they were of vigour, hope, and &s;pirit, to u&s;e them with effect.</P>
<P>Although the direct di&s;tance from Fort Anne, where the batteaux navigation on Wood Creek determined, or even from Skene&s;borough, to Fort Edward, was no greater, than what in England would be con&s;ider|ed as a moderate ride of exerci&s;e, yet &s;uch is the &s;a|vage face, and impracticable nature of the country, and &s;uch were the artificial difficulties which the in|du&s;try of the enemy had thrown in the way, that the progre&s;s of the army thither, was a work of much preparation, time, and labour. It will &s;carcely be be|lieved in after times, and may now be received with difficulty in any other part of the world, that it co&s;t an active and &s;pirited army, without an enemy in force to impede its progre&s;s, not many fewer days in pa&s;&s;ing from one part to another of a country, than the di&s;|tance, in a direct line, would have mea&s;ured miles, yet &s;uch, however extraordinary is the fact.&mdash;Be&s;ides that the country was a wilderne&s;s in almo&s;t every part of the pa&s;&s;age, the enemy had cut large timber trees in &s;uch a manner, on both &s;ides of the road, as to fall acro&s;s and lengthways, with their branches interwo|ven; &s;o that the troops had &s;everal layers of the&s;e frequently to remove, in places where they could not po&s;&s;ibly take any other direction. The face of the country was likewi&s;e &s;o broken with creeks and mar&s;h|es, that in that &s;hort &s;pace they had no le&s;s than forty bridges to con&s;truct, be&s;ides others to repair; and one of the&s;e was of log-work over a mora&s;s two miles in extent. All the&s;e toils and difficulties were encoun|tered and overcome by the troops with their u&s;ual pirit and alacrity. The enemy were too weak, too
<PB N="318" REF="324">much di&s;pirited, and probably too much afraid of the Indians, to add very materially to the&s;e difficulties.&mdash; Some &s;kirmi&s;hing and firing there was, however, on every day's march, in which, as u&s;ual, they con&s;tantly came off lo&s;ers.</P>
<P>It is true, that General Burgoyne might have a|dopted another route to Hud&s;on's river, by which mo&s;t of the&s;e particular difficulties would have been avoided. By returning down the South river to Ti|conderago, he might again have embarked the army on Lake George, and proceeded to the fort which takes its name, and lies at its head, from whence there is a waggon road to Fort Edward. To this it was objected, and probably with rea&s;on, that a retrogade motion in the height of victory, would tend greatly to abate that panic with which the enemy were con|founded and overwhelmed; that it would even cool the ardour, and check the animation of the troops, to call them off from the pro&s;ecution of their &s;ucce&s;s to a cold and &s;piritle&s;s voyage; and that their expedi|tion would undoubtedly be checked by the re&s;i&s;tance and delay which they mu&s;t expect at Fort George; whereas when the garri&s;on perceived that the army was marching in a direction, which was likely to cut off their retreat, they would undoubtedly con&s;ult their &s;afety in time by abandoning the po&s;t.</P>
<P>The enemy abandoned Fort Edward, and retired to Saratoga, at the approach of the royal army, which, from the impediments we have &s;een in the march, was not until the end of July. The enthu&s;ia&s;m of the ar|my, as well as of the General, upon their arrival on the Hud&s;on's river, which had been &s;o long the object of their hopes and wi&s;hes, may be better conceived than de&s;cribed. As the enemy, by previou&s;ly aban|doning
<PB N="319" REF="325">Fort George, and burning their ve&s;&s;els, had left the lake entirely open, a great embarkation of provi&s;ions, &s;tores, and nece&s;&s;aries, was already arriv|ed at that po&s;t from Ticonderago. The army was ac|cordingly fully and immediately employed, in tran&s;|porting tho&s;e articles, with artillery, batteaux, and &s;uch other matters as they judged nece&s;&s;ary for the pro&s;ecution of their future mea&s;ures, from Fort George to Hud&s;on's river.</P>
<P>Nothing could exceed the a&s;toni&s;hment and terror, which the lo&s;s of Ticonderago, and its immediate con|&s;equences, &s;pread throughout the New England pro|vinces. The General's manife&s;to, in which he di&s;|played the powers and numbers of the &s;avages, added perhaps to the effect. It was remarkable, however, that in the mid&s;t of all the&s;e di&s;a&s;ters, and con&s;equent terrors, no &s;ort of di&s;po&s;ition to &s;ubmit appeared in any quarter.</P>
<P>The New England governments in particular, tho' mo&s;t immediately menaced, did not &s;ink under their apprehen&s;ion of the common danger. They, as well as the Congre&s;s, acted with vigour and firmne&s;s in their efforts to repel the enemy. Arnold, whom we have lately &s;een at the engagement at Danbury, was immediately &s;ent to the reinforcement of the northern army, who carried with him a train of artil|lery, which he recived from Wa&s;hington. On his ar|rival he drew the American troops back from Sarato|ga to Still Water, a central &s;ituation between that place and the mouth of the Mohawk river, where it falls into Hud&s;on's. This movement was to be the nearer at hand to check the progre&s;s of Colonel St. Leger, who was now advancing upon the former of the&s;e rivers. His forces were daily increa&s;ed thro'
<PB N="320" REF="326">the outrages of the &s;avages, who, notwith&s;tanding the regulations and endeavours of General Burgoyne were too prone to the exerci&s;e of their u&s;ual cruel|ties, to be effectually re&s;trained by any means. The friends of the royal cau&s;e, as well as its enemies, were equally victims to their indi&s;criminate rage. Among other in&s;tances of this nature, the murder of Mi&s;s M'Crea, which happened &s;ome &s;mall time after, &s;truck every brea&s;t with horror.&mdash;Every circum|&s;tance of this horrid tran&s;action &s;erved to render it more calamitous and afflicting. The young lady is repre&s;ented to have been in all the innocence of youth and bloom of beauty. Her father was &s;aid to be deep|ly intere&s;ted in the royal cau&s;e; and to wind up the cata&s;trophe of this odious tragedy, &s;he was to be mar|ried to a Briti&s;h officer on the very day that &s;he was ma&s;&s;acred.</P>
<P>This tragedy will &s;tand as a deep blot in the annals of the pre&s;ent government as long as the &s;un revolves in his cour&s;e around this terre&s;trial globe.&mdash;This ma&s;&s;acre, and others its concomitants, will in &s;ome fu|ture reckoning make that coward tremble who is &s;aid to have given it &s;anction by the authority of his ma&s;|ter on this &s;ide the Atlantic; and that hero which boa&s;ted great things in his &s;anguinary proclamations, will find the gho&s;ts of innocents haunt him when the weapons of warfare are buried in peace.</P>
<P>Occa&s;ion was thence taken to exa&s;perate the peo|ple, and to blacken the royal party and army. Peo|ple were too apt to jumble promi&s;cuou&s;ly, and to place in one point of view, the cruelty of the&s;e barbarians, and the cau&s;e in which they were exerted. They e|qually execrated both.&mdash;Whil&s;t they abhorred and dete&s;ted that army which &s;ubmitted to accept of &s;uch
<PB N="321" REF="327">an aid, they loudly condemned and reprobated that government, which could call &s;uch auxiliaries into a civil conte&s;t; thereby endeavouring, as they &s;aid, not to &s;ubdue but to exterminate a people whom they af|fected to con&s;ider, and pretended to reclaim as &s;ub|jects. General Gates, in the cour&s;e of the&s;e tran&s;ac|tions, was not wanting by &s;everal publications to ag|gravate and inflame the picture of the&s;e exce&s;&s;es; and with no &s;mall effect.</P>
<P>By this means, the advantages expected from the terror that was con&s;tantly excited by the&s;e &s;a|vage auxiliaries were not only counteracted; but this terror rather, it may be thought, produced a directly contrary effect. The inhabitants of the open and frontier countries had no choice of acting; they had no means of &s;ecurity left, but by abandoning their habitations, and taking up arms. Every man &s;aw the nece&s;&s;ity of becoming a temporary &s;oldier, not only for his own &s;ecurity, but for the protection and de|fence of tho&s;e connections which are dearer than life it&s;elf. Thus an army was poured forth by the woods, mountains, and mar&s;hes, which in this part were thickly &s;own with plantations and villages. The A|mericans recalled their courage; and when their re|gular army &s;eemed to be entirely wa&s;ted, the &s;pirit of the country produced a much greater and more for|midable force.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the army under General Bur|goyne, in the neighbourhood of Fort Edward, began to experience tho&s;e difficulties, which increa&s;ed as it farther advanced, until they at length became in&s;ur|mountable. From the 30th of July, to the 15th of Augu&s;t, the army was continually employed, and eve|ry po&s;&s;ible mea&s;ure u&s;ed for the bringing forward of
<PB N="322" REF="328">batteaux, provi&s;ions, and ammunition from Fort George to the fir&s;t navigable part of Hud&s;on's river, a di&s;tance of about 18 miles. The toil was exce&s;&s;ive, in this &s;ervice, and the effect in no degree equivalent to the expence of labour and time. The roads were in &s;ome parts &s;teep, and in others required great re|pairs. Of the hor&s;es which had been &s;upplied by contract in Canada, through the various delays and accidents attending &s;o long and intricate a combina|tion of pa&s;&s;age by land, and carriage by water, not more than one third was yet arrived. The indu&s;try of the General had been able to collect no more than 50 teams of oxen, in all the country through which he had marched, or in this in which he at pre&s;ent &s;ojourn|ed. The&s;e re&s;ources were totally inadequate to the purpo&s;es of &s;upplying the army with provi&s;ions for its current con&s;umption, and to the e&s;tabli&s;hment at the &s;ame time of &s;uch a magazine as would enable in to pro&s;ecute the further operations of the campaign.&mdash; Exceeding heavy rains added to all the&s;e difficulties; and the impediments to the &s;ervice were &s;o various and &s;tubborn, that after the utmo&s;t exertion for fif|teen &s;ucce&s;&s;ive days, there was not above four days provi&s;ions in &s;tore, nor above ten batteaux in the Hud&s;on's River.</P>
<P>In the&s;e embarra&s;&s;ing and di&s;tre&s;&s;ing circum&s;tances, the General received intelligence, that Colonel St. Leger had arrived before, and was conducting his o|perations again&s;t Fort Stanwix. He in&s;tantly and ju&s;tly conceived, that a rapid movement forward at this critical juncture, would be of the utmo&s;t import|ance. If the enemy proceeded up the Mohawk, and that St. Leger &s;ucceeded, he would be liable to get between two fires; or at any rate, General Burgoyne's
<PB N="323" REF="329">army would get between him and Albany, &s;o that he mu&s;t either &s;tand an action, or by pa&s;&s;ing the Hud&s;on's River, endeavour to &s;ecure a retreat higher up to the New England provinces. If on the other hand, he abandoned Fort Stanwix to its fate, and fell back to Albany, the Mohawk country would of cour&s;e be en|tirely laid open, the junction with St. Leger e&s;tabli&s;h|ed, and the combined army at liberty and lei&s;ure to pre&s;cribe and chu&s;e its future line of operation.</P>
<P>The propriety of the movement was evident; but the difficulty lay, and great indeed it was, in finding means to carry the de&s;ign into execution. To main|tain &s;uch a communication with Fort George during the whole time of &s;o exten&s;ive a movement, as would afford a daily &s;upply of provi&s;ion to an army, whil&s;t its di&s;tance was continually increa&s;ing, and its cour&s;e liable to frequent variations, was obviou&s;ly impractica|ble. The army was too weak to afford a chain of po&s;ts for &s;uch an extent: continual e&s;corts for every &s;eparate &s;upply, would be a &s;till greater drain; and in either ca&s;e, the enemy had a body of militia within a night's march at White Creek, &s;ufficient to break the line of communication.</P>
<P>Some other &s;ource of &s;upply was therefore to be &s;ought, or the de&s;ign to be dropped, and the pro&s;|pect of advantage which it pre&s;ented totally relinqui&s;h|ed. The enemy received large &s;upplies of live cat|tle from the New England provinces, which pa&s;&s;ing the upper part of the Connecticut river, took the route of Manche&s;ter, Arlington, and other parts of the New Hamp&s;hire grants, a tract of land di&s;puted be|tween that province and New York, until they were at length depo&s;ited at Bennington, from whence they were conveyed as occa&s;ion required to the rebel ar|my.
<PB N="324" REF="330">Bennington lies between the forks of the Ho|&s;ick River, before their obtaining that name, and with|out being touched by either, and not 20 miles to the ea&s;tward of Hud&s;on's; a place &s;o ob&s;cure, and &s;o in|capable from &s;ituation of being otherwi&s;e, that nothing but the pre&s;ent troubles could have called it into no|tice. It was however at this time, be&s;ides being a &s;tore for cattle, a depo&s;it for large quantities of corn, and other nece&s;&s;aries; and what rendered it an ob|ject of particular attention to the royal army, a large number of wheel carriages, of which they were in par|ticular want, were al&s;o laid up there. This place was guarded by a body of militia, which underwent &s;uch frequent changes that its number was nece&s;&s;arily uncertain.</P>
<P>The General &s;aw that the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of this depo|&s;it, would at once remove all the impediments that re|&s;trained the operations of the army, and enable him to proceed directly in the pro&s;ecution of his de&s;ign.&mdash; He accordingly laid a &s;cheme to &s;urprize the place, and entru&s;ting the execution of it to the German Lieu|tenant Colonel Baum, who had been immediately &s;e|lected, and was then preparing to conduct an expedi|tion tending to &s;imilar purpo&s;es, towards the borders of the Connecticut River.</P>
<P>The force allotted to this &s;ervice amounted to about 500 men, con&s;i&s;ting of about 200 of Reide&s;el's di&s;|mounted German dragroons, Captain Frazer's mark&s;|men, the Canada volunteers, a party of provincials, who were perfectly acquainted with the country, and about a hundred Indians; the corps carried with them two light pieces of artillery.</P>
<P>In order to facilitate this operation, and to be rea|dy to take advantage of its &s;ucce&s;s, the army moved
<PB N="325" REF="331">up the ea&s;t &s;hore of Hud&s;on's River, where it encamp|ed nearly oppo&s;ite to Saratoga, having at the &s;ame time thrown a bridge of rafts over, by which the advanced corps were pa&s;&s;ed to that place. At the &s;ame time Lieutenant Colonel Breyman's corps, con&s;i&s;ting of the Brun&s;wick grenadiers, light infantry, and Cha&s;&s;eurs, were po&s;ted at Batten Kill, in order if nece&s;&s;ary to &s;up|port Baum.</P>
<P>The latter in his march fell in with a party of the enemy who were e&s;corting &s;ome cattle and provi&s;ions, both of which he took with little difficulty, and &s;ent back to the camp. The &s;ame fatal impediment which retarded all the operations of the army, viz. the want of hor&s;es and carriages, concurred with the badne&s;s of the roads in rendering Baum's advice &s;o tedious, that the enemy were well informed of the de&s;ign, and had time to prepare for his reception. Upon his approach to the place, having received intelli|gence that the enemy were too &s;trong to be attacked by his pre&s;ent force with any pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s, he took a tolerable good po&s;t near Santcoick mills on the nearer branch of what comes afterwards the Ho|&s;ick River, which is there called Walloon Creek, and at about four miles di&s;tance from Bennington; di&s;|patching at the &s;ame time an expre&s;s to the General with an account of his &s;ituation.</P>
<P>Colonel Breyman was accordingly di&s;patched from Batten-Kill to reinforce Baum. That evil fortune now began to appear, which for &s;ome time after con|tinued to &s;weep every thing before it. Breyman was &s;o overlayed by bad weather, &s;o &s;unk and embarra&s;|&s;ed in bad roads, and met with &s;uch delays from the weakne&s;s and tiring of hor&s;es, and the difficulty of pa&s;|&s;ing
<PB N="326" REF="332">the artillery carriages, through a country &s;carce|ly practicable at any time, and now rendered much wor&s;e by the continual rain, that he was from eight in the morning of the 15th of Augu&s;t, to four in the afternoon of the &s;ame day, notwith&s;tanding every po&s;|&s;ible exertion of men and officers, in getting forward about twenty-four miles.</P>
<P>General Starke, who commanded the militia at Bennington, determined not to wait for the junction of the two parties, advanced in the morning, whil&s;t Breyman was yet &s;truggling with the difficulties of his march, to attack Baum in his po&s;t, which he had en|trenched, and rendered as defen&s;ible as time and its nature would permit. The loyal provincials who were along with him were &s;o eager in their hopes to find what they wi&s;hed to be real, that when the ene|my were &s;urrounding his po&s;t on all &s;ides, they for &s;ome time per&s;uaded him, that they were bodies of armed friends who were coming to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance.&mdash; The Colonel &s;oon di&s;covered their error, and made a brave defence. His &s;mall works being at length car|ried on every &s;ide, and his two pieces of cannon tak|en, mo&s;t of the Indians, with &s;everal of the provinci|als, Canadians, and Briti&s;h mark&s;men, e&s;caped in the woods. The German dragoons &s;till kept together, and when their ammunition was expended were brave|ly led by their Colonel to charge with their &s;words.&mdash; They were &s;oon overwhelmed, and the &s;urvivors, a|mong whom was their wounded Colonel, were made pri&s;oners.</P>
<P>Breyman, who had the hard fortune not to receive the &s;malle&s;t information of this engagement, arrived near the &s;ame ground about four in the afternoon, where in&s;tead of meeting his friends, he found his de|tachments
<PB N="327" REF="333">attacked on all &s;ides by the enemy. Not|with&s;tanding the &s;evere fatigue they had undergone, his troops behaved with great vigour and re&s;olution, and drove the Americans in the beginning from two or three different hills, from which they had po&s;ts.&mdash; They were however at length overpowered, and their ammunition being unfortunately expended, although each &s;oldier had brought out forty rounds in his pouch they were obliged with great reluctance to abandon the two pieces of artillery they had brought with them, and to retreat in the be&s;t manner they could; a circum&s;tance to which the latene&s;s of the evening was very favourable.</P>
<P>The lo&s;s of men &s;u&s;tained by the&s;e two engage|ments could not be le&s;s than five or &s;ix hundred, of whom however, the greater part were pri&s;oners.&mdash; But this was not the only or the greate&s;t lo&s;s. The reputation and courage which it afforded to the mili|tia to find that they were able to defeat regular for|ces; that neither Engli&s;hmen nor Germans were in|vincible, nor invulnerable in their impre&s;&s;ions; and the hope and confidence excited by the artillery, and other trophies of victory, were of much greater con&s;e|quence. This was the fir&s;t turn which fortune had taken in favour of the Americans in the northern war &s;ince &s;ome time before the death of Montgome|ry; misfortune had &s;ucceeded misfortune, and defeat had trod upon the heel of defeat, &s;ince that period. This was the fir&s;t in&s;tance in the pre&s;ent campaign, in which &s;he &s;eemed even wavering, much le&s;s that &s;he for a moment quitted the royal &s;tandard. The exult|ation was accordingly great on the one &s;ide; nor could the other avoid &s;eeling &s;ome damp that ea|gerne&s;s
<PB N="328" REF="334">of hope, and receiving &s;ome check to that a&s;+&s;ured confidence of &s;ucce&s;s which an unmixed &s;eries of fortunate events mu&s;t naturally excite.</P>
<P>St. Leger's attempt upon Fort Stanwix, (now nam|ed by the Americans Fort Schuyler) was &s;oon after its commencement favoured by a &s;ucce&s;s &s;o &s;ignal, as would in other ca&s;es, and a more fortunate &s;ea&s;on, have been decicive as to the fate of a &s;tronger and much more important fortre&s;s. General Harkiner, a leading man of that country, was marching at the head of eight or nine hundred of the Tryon county militia, with a convoy of provi&s;ions, to the relief of the &s;ort. St. Leger, well aware of the danger of being attacked in his trenches, and of with&s;tanding the whole weight of the garri&s;on in &s;ome particular, and probably weak point at the &s;ame in&s;tant, and equally well under&s;tand|ing the kind of &s;ervice for which the Indians were pe|culiarly calculated, judiciou&s;ly detached Sir John John&s;on with &s;ome regulars, the whole or part of his own regiment, and the &s;avages, to lie in ambu&s;h in the woods, and intercept the enemy upon their march.</P>
<P>It &s;hould &s;eem by the conduct of the militia and their leader, that they were not only totally ignorant of all military duties, but that they had even never heard by report of the nature of an Indian war, or of that pe|culiar &s;ervice in the woods, to which from its nature and &s;ituation their country was at all times liable.&mdash; Without an examination of their ground, without a reconnoitering or flanking party, they plunged blindly into the trap that was laid for their de&s;truction. Be|ing thrown into &s;udden and ineveitable di&s;order, by a near and heavy fire on almo&s;t all fides, it was complet|ed by the Indians, who in&s;tantly pur&s;uing their fire, ru&s;hed in upon their broken ranks, and made a mo&s;t
<PB N="329" REF="335">dreadful &s;laughter among&s;t them with their &s;pears and hatchets. Notwith&s;tanding their want of conduct, the militia &s;hewed no want of courage in their deplor|able &s;ituation. In the mid&s;t of &s;uch extreme danger, and &s;o bloody an execution, rendered &s;till more terri|ble by the horrid appearance and demeanour of the principal actors, they recollected them&s;elves &s;o far as to recover an advantageous ground, which enabled them after to maintain a &s;ort of running fight, by which about one third of their number was pre&s;erved.</P>
<P>The lo&s;s was &s;uppo&s;ed to be on their &s;ide about 400 killed, and half that number pri&s;oners.&mdash;It was thought of the greater con&s;equence, as almo&s;t all tho&s;e who were con&s;idered as the principal leaders and in|&s;tigaters of rebellion in that country were now de|&s;troyed. The triumph and exultation were accord|ingly great, and all oppo&s;ition from the militia in that country was &s;uppo&s;ed to be at an end. The circum|&s;tance of old neighbourhood and per&s;onal knowledge between many of the parties in the pre&s;ent rage and animo&s;ity of faction, could by no mean, be favourable to the exten&s;ion of mercy; even &s;uppo&s;ing that it might have been otherwi&s;e practi&s;ed with prudence and &s;afe|ty, at a time when the power of the Indians was ra|ther prevalent, and that their rage was implacable. For according to their computation and ideas of lo&s;s, the &s;avages had purcha&s;ed this victory exceedingly dear, 33 of their number having been &s;lain, and 29 wounded, among whom were &s;everal of their principal leaders, and of their di&s;tingui&s;hed and favourite war|riors. This lo&s;s accordingly rendered them &s;o di&s;con|tented, intractable, and ferocious, that the &s;ervice was greatly affected by their ill di&s;po&s;ition. The unhappy pri&s;oners were however its fir&s;t objects; mo&s;t of whom
<PB N="330" REF="336">they inhumanly butchered in cold blood. The New Yorkers, rangers, and other troops, were not with|out lo&s;s in this action.</P>
<P>On the day, and probably during the time of this engagement, the garri&s;on, having recived intelligence of the approach of their friends, endeavoured to make a diver&s;ion in their favour, by a vigourous and well conducted fally, under the direction of Colonel Willet, their &s;econd in command. Willet conducted his bu&s;ine&s;s with ability and &s;pirit. He did con&s;idera|ble mi&s;chief in the camp, brought off &s;ome trophies no incon&s;iderable &s;poil, &s;ome of which con&s;i&s;ted of articles that were greatly wanted, a few pri&s;oners, and returned with little or no lo&s;s. He afterwards under|took, in company with another officer, a much more perilous expedition. They pa&s;&s;ed by night through the be&s;iegers works, and in contempt of the danger and cruelty of the &s;avages, made their way for 50 miles through pathle&s;s woods, and unexplored mora&s;|&s;es, in order to rai&s;e the country and bring relief to the fort. Such an action demands the prai&s;e even of an enemy.</P>
<P>Colonel St. Leger left no means untried to profit of his victory by intimidating the garri&s;on. He &s;ent verbal and written me&s;&s;ages, &s;tating their hopele&s;s &s;ituation, the utter de&s;truction of their friends, the im|po&s;&s;ibility of their obtaining relief, as General Bur|goyne, after de&s;troying every thing in his way, was now at Albany receiving the &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion of all the ad|joining counties, and by prodigiou&s;ly magnifying his own force.&mdash;He repre&s;ented, that in this &s;tate of things, if through an incorrigible ob&s;tinacy, they &s;hould continue a hopele&s;s and fruitle&s;s defence, they would, according to the practice of the mo&s;t civilized
<PB N="331" REF="337">nations, be cut off from all conditions, and every hope of mercy. But he particularly dwelt upon the pains he had taken in &s;oftening the rage of the Indians for their late lo&s;s, and obtaining from them &s;ecurity, that in ca&s;e of an immediate &s;urrender of the fort, every man of the garri&s;on &s;hould be &s;pared; whil&s;t on the other hand they declared with the mo&s;t bitter execra|tions, that if they met with any further re&s;i&s;tance, they would not only ma&s;&s;acre the garri&s;on, but that every man, woman, and child, in the Mohawk coun|try would nece&s;&s;arily, and however again&s;t his will, fall &s;acrifices to the fury of the &s;avages. This point he &s;aid he pre&s;&s;ed entirely on the &s;core of humanity; he promi&s;ed on his part, in ca&s;e of an immediate &s;ur|render, every attention which a humane and gene|rous enemy could give.</P>
<P>The Governor, Colonel Gan&s;evort, behaved with great firmne&s;s. He replied, that he had been entru&s;ted with the charge of that garri&s;on by the U|nited States of America; that he would defend the tru&s;t committed to his care at every hazard, and to the utmo&s;t extremity; and that he neither thought him&s;elf accountable for, nor &s;hould he at all concern him&s;elf about any con&s;equences that attended the di&s;|charge of his duty. It was &s;hrewdly remarked in the fort, that half the pains would not have been taken to di&s;play the force immediately without, or the &s;ucce&s;s at a di&s;tance, if they bore any proportion at all to the magnitude in which they were repre&s;ented.</P>
<P>The Briti&s;h commander was much di&s;appointed in the &s;tate of the fort. It was &s;tronger, in better con|dition, and much better defended than he expected.&mdash; After great labour in his approaches, he found his ar|tillery deficient, being in&s;ufficient in weight to make
<PB N="332" REF="338">any con&s;iderable impre&s;&s;ion. The only remedy was to bring his approaches &s;o near that they mu&s;t take effect; which he &s;et about with the greate&s;t diligence. In the mean time, the Indians continued &s;ullen and in|tractable. Their late lo&s;&s;es might have been cured by certain advantages; but the misfortune was, they had yet got no plunder, and their pro&s;pect of getting any &s;eemed to grow every day fainter. It is the pe|culiar characteri&s;tic of that people, to exhibit in cer|tain in&s;tances degrees of courage and per&s;everence, which &s;hock rea&s;on and credibility, and to betray in others the greate&s;t irre&s;olution and timidity; with a total want of that con&s;tancy which might enable them for any length of time to &s;truggle with difficulty.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t the commander was carrying on his opera|tions with the utmo&s;t indu&s;try, the Indians received a flying report that Arnold was coming with a thou&s;and men to relieve the fort. The commander endeavour|ed to hearten them, by promi&s;ing to lead them him|&s;elf, to bring all his be&s;t troops into action, and by car|rying their leaders out to mark a field of battle, and the flattery of con&s;ulting them upon the intended plan of operation .Whil&s;t he was thus endeavouring to &s;oothe their temper, and to revive their flagging &s;pi|rits, other &s;couts arrived with intelligence, probably contrived in part by them&s;elves, which fir&s;t doubled, and afterwards trebled the number of the enemy, with the comfortable addition, that Burgoyne's army was entirely cut to pieces. The Colonel returned to the camp, and called a council of their chiefs, hoping that by the influence which Sir John John&s;on, and the &s;uperintendants Claus and Butler had over them, they might &s;till be induced to make a &s;tand. He was di&s;|appointed. A part of the Indians decamped whil&s;t
<PB N="333" REF="339">the council was &s;itting, and the remainder threatened peremptorily to abandon him, if he did not immedi|ately retreat.</P>
<P>Augu&s;t 22d. The retreat was of cour&s;e precipi|tate; or it was rather, in plain terms, a flight, attend|ed with di&s;agreeable circum&s;tances. The tents, with mo&s;t of the artillery, &s;tores, &s;ell into the hands of the garri&s;on. It appears by the Colonel's own account that he was apprehen&s;ive of danger from the fury of his &s;avage allies, as the could from the re&s;entment of his declared American enemies. It al&s;o appears from the &s;ame authority, that the Me&s;&s;a&s;ages, a nation of &s;avages to the we&s;t, plundered &s;everal of the boats be|longing to the army. By the American accounts, which are in part confirmed by others, it is &s;aid that they robbed the officers of their baggage, and of eve|ry other article to which they took any liking; and the army in general of their provi&s;ions. They al&s;o &s;ay, that at a few miles di&s;tance from the camp, they fir&s;t &s;tripped of their arms, and afterwards murdered with their own bayonets all tho&s;e Briti&s;h, German, and American &s;oldiers, who from an inability to keep up, fear, or any other cau&s;e, were &s;eparated from the main body.</P>
<P>The &s;tate of the fact with re&s;pect to the intended re|lief of the fort is, that Arnold had advanced by the way of Half Moon up the Mohawk River 2000 men for that purpo&s;e; and that for the greater expedition, he had quitted the main body, and arrived by forced marches through the woods, with a detachment of 900 at the fort, on the 24th on the evening, two days af|ter the &s;iege had been rai&s;ed.&mdash;So that upon the whole, the intractablene&s;s of the Indians, with their watchful apprehen&s;ions of danger, probably &s;aved
<PB N="334" REF="340">them from a cha&s;ti&s;ement, which would not have been tenderly admini&s;tered.</P>
<P>Nothing could have been more untoward in the pre&s;ent &s;ituation of affairs, than the unfortunate i&s;&s;ue of this expedition. The Americans repre&s;ented this and the affair at Bennington as a great and glorious victories. Nothing cuold-exceed their exultation and confidence. Gan&s;evort and Willer, with General Starke and Colonel Warner, who had commanded at Bennintgon, were ranked among&s;t tho&s;e who were con&s;idered as the &s;aviours of their country. The nor|thern militia began now to look high, and to forget all di&s;tinctions between them&s;elves and regular troops. As this confidence, opinion, and pride increa&s;ed, the apprehen&s;ion of General Burgoyne's army of cour&s;e declined, until it &s;oon became to be talked of with in|difference and contempt, and even its fortune to be publicly progno&s;ticated. In the mean time, General Gates, on who&s;e conduct and ability it appears the Americans had placed much reliance, arrived to take the command of the army; an event which gave a new &s;pur to their exertion, and afforded an additional &s;upport to their hopes. The arrival of Gates enabled Arnold, who &s;till held the next place in every thing to the commander in chief, and between whom it ap|pears the mo&s;t perfect harmony prevailed, to &s;et out on that expedition to Fort Stanwix, which has been ju&s;t related.</P>
<P>During this time, General Burgoyne continued in his camp on the ea&s;tern &s;hore of the Hud&s;on's River, nearly oppo&s;ite to Saratoga, where he u&s;ed the mo&s;t unremitting indu&s;try and per&s;everence, in bringing &s;tores and provi&s;ions forward from Fort George. As a &s;well of the water occa&s;ioned by great rains had car|ried
<PB N="335" REF="341">away his bridge of rafts, he threw another, of boats, over the river at the fame place. Having at length by good management obtained and brought forward about thirty days provi&s;ion, with other ne|ce&s;&s;ary &s;tores, he took a re&s;olution of pa&s;&s;ing the Hud|&s;on's River, with the army, which he accordingly car|ried into execution towards the middle of September, and encamped on the heights and in the plain of Sa|ratoga, the enemy being then in the neighbourhood of Still Water.</P>
<P>Though this mea&s;ure of pa&s;&s;ing the Hud&s;on's river, has not only been a &s;ubject of much di&s;cu&s;&s;ion at home but al&s;o of parliamentary enquiry; yet as it &s;till lies open, without any deci&s;ion on its merits, and that the General's in&s;tructions are not publicly known, nor per|haps all his motives thoroughly under&s;tood, we &s;hall not pre&s;ume to form any opinion upon the que&s;tion. It will be &s;ufficient to ob&s;erve, that in his letter to the American Mini&s;ter he &s;ays, That he thinks it a duty of ju&s;tice to take upon him&s;elf the mea&s;ure of having pa&s;&s;ed the Hud&s;on's River, in order to force a pa&s;&s;age to Albany. And that he did not think him&s;elf author|ized to call any men into council, when the peremp|tory tenor of his orders, and the &s;ea&s;on of the year&punc; admitted of no alternative. He al&s;o gives, in a &s;ub|&s;equent part of the &s;ame letter, the following &s;tate of his rea&s;oning, at a time when the army was in very critical and hazardous circum&s;tances. "The expedi|tion I commanded was evidently meant at fir&s;t to be <HI>hazarded.</HI> Circum&s;tances might requre it &s;hould be <HI>devoted;</HI> a critical junction of Mr Gates's force with Mr Wa&s;hington might po&s;&s;ibly decide the fate of the war; the failure of my junction with Sir Harry Clin|ton, or the lo&s;s of my retreat to Canada, could only
<PB N="336" REF="342">be a partial misfortune." Whether his retreat was at this period quite practicable, even if his orders had not been to advance at all hazards, is uncertain.</P>
<P>Such it &s;eems were the principles of the General's conduct in &s;ome of the &s;ucceeding events. As the ar|my advanced along the river towards the enemy, they found the country very impracticable, being covered with thick woods, and a continual repair of bridges nece&s;&s;ary. Being at length arrived in the front of the enemy, &s;ome woods only of no great extent inter|vening, the General put him&s;elf at the head of the Briti&s;h line which compo&s;ed the right wing.&mdash;That wing was covered by General Frazer and Colonel Breyman, with the grenadiers, and light infantry of the army, who kept along &s;ome high grounds which commanded its right flank, being them&s;elves covered by the Indians, provincials, and Canadians, in the front and flanks. The left wing and artillery under the Majors General Philips and Reide&s;el, kept along the great road and meadows by the river &s;ide.</P>
<P>The enemy, being incapable from the nature of the country of perceiving the different combinations of the march, i&s;&s;ued from their camp in great force, with a de&s;ign of turning the right wing, and taking the Bri|ti&s;h line on the flank. Being unexpectedly checked in this de&s;ign, by the &s;trong po&s;ition of General Fra|zer, they immediately countermarched, and the &s;ame particularity of country which had occa&s;ioned their mi&s;take, now operating as effectually to prevent the di&s;covery, and con&s;equently the taking and advantage of their &s;ub&s;equent movement, they directing their principal effort to the left of the &s;ame wing.</P>
<P>The Briti&s;h troops were not a little &s;urprized at the boldne&s;s with which they began the attack, and the

<PB N="337" REF="344">vigour and ob&s;tinacy with which it was &s;u&s;tained, from three o'clock in the afternoon till after &s;un&s;et. Ar|nold led on the enemy, and &s;ought danger with an ea|gerne&s;s, and intrepedity which though much in his character was at no time more eminently di&s;tingui&s;h|ed. The enemy were, however, continually &s;upplied with fre&s;h troops, whil&s;t the weight of the action lay principally for a long time upon the 20th, the 21&s;t, and 62d regiments. It will be needle&s;s to &s;ay, that they behaved with their u&s;ual firmne&s;s and gallantry, though it may not be totolly &s;uperfluous to ob&s;erve, that the greater part of the&s;e three regiments, were engaged for near four hours without intermi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t of the other corps of the army, bore al&s;o good &s;hare in the bu&s;ine&s;s of the day. The 24th regiment, which belonged to Frazer's brigade, with the grena|diers and a part of the light infantry, were for &s;ome time brought into action, and charged with their u&s;u|al &s;pirit and bravery. Breyman's riflemen and &s;ome other parts of his corps, al&s;o did good &s;ervice; but the&s;e troops only acted partially and occa&s;ionally, as the heights on which they had been originally po&s;t|ed, were of two great importance to be totally evacu|ated.</P>
<P>Major-General Philips upon fir&s;t hearing the firing made his way with Major Williams and a part of the artillery through a very difficult part of the wood, and from that time rendered mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential &s;ervice.&mdash; It &s;eems as if in one in&s;tance his pre&s;ence of mind had nearly &s;aved the army, when, in the mo&s;t critical point of time, he re&s;tored the action by leading up the 20th regiment, the enemy having then a great &s;uperi|ority of fire. Though every part of the artillery performed almo&s;t wonders, the brave Captain Jones
<PB N="338" REF="345">(who was unfortunately, though gloriou&s;ly, killed) with his brigade, were particularly di&s;tingui&s;hed.&mdash; Major-General Reide&s;el al&s;o exerted him&s;elf to bring up a part of the left wing, and arrived in time to charge the enemy with bravery and effect. Ju&s;t as the light clo&s;ed, the enemy retired; and left the roy|al army ma&s;ters of the field of battle. The dark|ne&s;s equally prevented pur&s;uit and pri&s;oners.</P>
<P>Upon the whole the royal army gained nothing but honour by this arduous &s;truggle and hard-fought bat|tle. They had now grappled with &s;uch an enemy as they had never before encountred in America; and &s;uch as they were too apt to imagine it could not pro|duce. The flattering ideas that the Americans could only fight under the covert of walls, hedges, or en|trenchments, and were in capable of &s;u&s;taining a fair and open conflict in the field were now at an end.&mdash;This opinion had al&s;o been in &s;ome mea&s;ure &s;haken in the &s;outh. Here they met with a foe who &s;eemed as ea|ger for action, as carele&s;s of danger, and as indiffer|ent with re&s;pect to ground or cover as them&s;elves;&mdash; and after a hard and clo&s;e conte&s;t of four hours, hand to hand, when darkne&s;s put an end to the engage|ment, the royal forces but barely kept the field, and the Americans only returned to the camp.</P>
<P>We lo&s;t many brave men in this action, and it was not much matter of comfort that the Americans had lo&s;t a great number. The army lay all night on their arms in the field of battle, and in the morning took a po&s;ition nearly within cannon &s;hot of the enemy's camp, fortifying their right wing, and extending their left &s;o as to cover tho&s;e meadows through which the river runs, and where their batteaux and ho&s;pitals were placed. The 47th regiment, with that of He&s;&s;e
<PB N="339" REF="346">Hanau, and a corps of provincials, were encamped in the meadows as an additional &s;ecurity. The enemy's right was incapable of approach, and their left was too &s;trongly fortified to be in&s;ulted.</P>
<P>The zeal and alacrity of the Indians began from this time to &s;lacken.&mdash;Though the General com|plains in his di&s;patches of the ill effects of their de|&s;ertion, he does not &s;pecify the particular time of their abandoning the army. This clo&s;e and danger|ous &s;ervice was by no means &s;uited to their di&s;po&s;ition, and the pro&s;pect of plunder was narrowed to no|thing. Fidelity and honour were principles for which they had no terms, and of which they could frame no ideas. Some letters had lately pa&s;&s;ed between Gates and General Burgoyne, in which bitter re|proaches relative to the barbarities committed by the &s;avages were thrown out by the one, and tho&s;e charg|es were in general denied, and in part palliated by the other.&mdash;The &s;avages likewi&s;e received &s;ome check on account of the murder of Mi&s;s M-Crea.&mdash; Upon &s;ome or all of the&s;e accounts, they de&s;erted the army in the &s;ea&s;on of its danger and di&s;tre&s;s, when their aid would have been mo&s;t particularly u&s;eful, and afforded a &s;econd in&s;tance within a &s;hort time, of the little reliance that could be placed on &s;uch aux|iliaries.</P>
<P>A great de&s;ertion al&s;o prevailed among&s;t the Cana|dians and Briti&s;h provincials, nor does it &s;eem as if the fidelity or &s;ervices of tho&s;e who remained, were much depended on or e&s;teemed. General Burgoyne had from the beginning, nor did it entirely for&s;ake him at this time, a firm hope of being powerfully &s;uc|coured if wanted, or at any rate of being met and joined at Albany by a &s;trong force from the army at
<PB N="340" REF="347">New York. He now received with great difficulty a letter in cypher from Sir Harry Clinton, informing him of his intention to make a diver&s;ion on the North River, by attacking the Fort Montgomery, and &s;ome other fortre&s;&s;$s which the rebels had erected in the Highlands, in order to guard the pa&s;&s;age up that ri|ver to Albany. Though this diver&s;ion fell far &s;hort of the aid which the General expected, he however hoped that it might afford e&s;&s;ential &s;ervice by oblig|ing Gates to divide his army. He accordingly re|turned the me&s;&s;enger, and afterwards di&s;patched two officers in di&s;gui&s;e, and other confidential per&s;ons, all &s;eparately and by different routes, to acquaint Clinton with his exact &s;tate, &s;ituation, and condition; to pre&s;s him urgently to the immediate pro&s;ecution of his de&s;ign; and to inform him that he was enabled in point of provi&s;ion, and fixed in his determination, to hold his pre&s;ent po&s;ition, in the hope of favour|able events, until the 12th of the following month.</P>
<P>In the mean time every means were u&s;ed for forti|fying the camp, and &s;trong redoubts were erected for the protection of the magazines and ho&s;pitals, not on|ly to guard again&s;t any &s;udden attacks, but for their &s;ecurity in any future movement which the army might make in order to turn the enemy's flank. The &s;tricte&s;t watch on the motions of the enemy, and at|tention on every quarter to their own &s;ecurity, be|came every day more indi&s;pen&s;ible, as Gates's army was continually increa&s;ing in force by the acce&s;&s;ion of fre&s;h bodies of the militia.</P>
<P>The &s;pirit of exertion and enterprize which was now rai&s;ed in the New England provinces, was be|come too general, and too much animated by &s;ucce&s;s, to be ea&s;ily with&s;tood at once in all the different points
<PB N="341" REF="348">of its direction. Whil&s;t General Burgoyne was ful|ly engaged with Gates and Arnold, and found him|&s;elf immediately involved in circum&s;tances &s;ufficiently perplexing, all his difficulties were increa&s;ed, and his &s;ituation was rendered much more critical and preca|rious, by an unexpected enterprize of the militia from the other parts of New Hamp&s;hire and the head of the Connecticut, totally to cut of all means of com|munication with Canada, by recovering the forts of Ticonderago and Mount Independence, and becom|ing again ma&s;ters, at lea&s;t, of Lake George.</P>
<P>The expedition was under the direction of Gene|ral Lincoln, and the immediate execution was com|mitted to the Colonels Brown, John&s;ton, and Wood|bury, with detachments of about 500 men each.&mdash; They conducted their operations with &s;uch &s;ecrecy and addre&s;s, that they effectually &s;urprized all the out|po&s;ts between the landing place at the north end of Lake George, and the body of the fortre&s;s of Ticon|derago. Mount Defiance, Mount Hope, the French lines, and a block-hou&s;e, with 200 batteaux, an arm|ed &s;loop, and &s;everal gun-boats, were almo&s;t in&s;tantly taken. Four companies of foot, with nearly an equal number of Canadians, and many of the officers and crews of the ve&s;&s;els were made pri&s;oners; whil&s;t they afforded liberty for a number of their own people, who were confined in &s;ome of the works they had taken, and after repeated &s;ummons to Brigadier Powel who commanded, and who gallantly rejected all their pro|po&s;als, they for four days made reiterated attacks upon the works at Ticonderago, and Mount Indepen|dence; until finding they were repul&s;ed in every a&s;|&s;ault, and totally unequal to the &s;ervice, they at length abandoned the de&s;ign.</P>
<PB N="342" REF="349">
<P>In the beginning of October, General Burgoyne thought it expedient, from the uncertainty of his &s;itu|ation, to le&s;&s;en the &s;oldiers ratios of provi&s;ions; a mea&s;ure, which however di&s;agreeable to an army, was now &s;ubmitted to with a chearfulne&s;s which me|rited the highe&s;t regards, and did the greate&s;t honors to the troops. Things continued in this &s;tate until the 7th of October, when there being no appearance or intelligence of the expected co-operations, and the time limited for the &s;tay of the army in the pre&s;ent camp within four or five days of being expired, it was judged advi&s;eable to make a movement to the ene|my's left, not only to di&s;cover whether there were any po&s;&s;ible means of forcing a pa&s;&s;age, &s;hould it be judged nece&s;&s;ary to advance, or of di&s;lodging them for the convenience of the retreat, but al&s;o to cover a forage of the army, which was exceedingly di&s;tre&s;|&s;ed by the pre&s;ent &s;carcity.</P>
<P>A detachment of 1500 regular troops, with two twelve pounders, two howitzers, and &s;ix &s;ix-pounders, were ordered to move, being commanded by the General in per&s;on, who was &s;econded by tho&s;e ex|cellent officers, the Majors General Philips and Reide|&s;el, with Brigadier-General Frazer. No equal num|ber of men was ever better commanded, and it would have been difficult indeed to have matched the men with any equal number.&mdash;The guard of the camp upon the high grounds was committed to the Brigadiers General Hamilton and Speight; that of the redoubts and the plain near the river, to Briga|dier Goll. The force of the enemy immediately in the front of the lines, was &s;o much &s;uperior, that it was not thought &s;afe to augment the detachment be|yond the number we have &s;tated.</P>
<PB N="343" REF="350">
<P>The troops were formed within three quarters of a mile of the enemy's left, and the irregulars were pu&s;hed on through bye ways to appear as a check on their rear. But the further intended operations of the detachment were prevented, by a very &s;udden and mo&s;t rapid attack of the enemy upon the Briti&s;h grenadiers, who were po&s;ted to &s;upport the left wing of the line. Major Ackland, at the head of the grenadiers, &s;u&s;tained this fierce attack with great re&s;olution; but the numbers of the enemy enabling them, in a few minutes, to extend the attack along the whole front of the Germans, who were po&s;ted immediately on the right of the grenadiers, it became impracticable to move any part of that body, for the purpo&s;e of forming a &s;econd line to &s;upport the flank, where the great weight of the fire &s;till fell.</P>
<P>The right was &s;till unengaged; but it was &s;oon per|ceived that the enemy were marching a &s;trong body round their flank, in order to cut off their retreat.&mdash; To oppo&s;e this bold and dangerous attempt, the light infantry, with a part of the 24th regiment, which were joined with them at that po&s;t, were thrown into a &s;econd line, in order to recover the retreat of the troops into camp.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t this motion was yet in proce&s;s, the enemy pu&s;hed a fre&s;h and &s;trong reinforcement to decide the action on the left, which being totally overpowered by &s;o great a &s;uperiority, was compelled by dint of force to give way; upon which, the light infantry and 24th regiment, were obliged, by a very quick movement, to endeavour to &s;ave that wing from being totally ruined.&mdash;It was in this movement, that the brave Brigadier General Frazer was mortally wound|ed. An officer who&s;e lo&s;s would have been general|ly
<PB N="344" REF="351">felt, and his place with difficulty &s;upplied, in a corps of the mo&s;t accompli&s;hed officers.</P>
<P>The &s;ituation of the detachment was now exceed|ingly critical; but the danger to which the lines were expo&s;ed were &s;till more alarming and &s;erious. Philips and Reide&s;el were ordered to cover the retreat, and tho&s;e troops which were neare&s;t, or mo&s;t di&s;engaged, returned as fa&s;t as they could for their defence.&mdash; The troops in general retreated in good order, tho' very hard pre&s;&s;ed. They were obliged to abandon &s;ix pieces of cannon, the hor&s;es not only being de|&s;troyed, but mo&s;t of the brave artillery-men, who had as u&s;ual, under the conduct of Major Will&icirc;ams, di&s;|played the utmo&s;t &s;kill and ability in their profe&s;&s;ion, along with the mo&s;t undaunted re&s;olution, being ei|ther killed or dangerou&s;ly wounded.</P>
<P>The enemy pur&s;ued their &s;ucce&s;s with great eager|ne&s;s. The troops had &s;carce entered the camp, when the Americans &s;tormed it in different parts with un|common fiercene&s;s; ru&s;hing to the lines through a &s;e|vere fire of grape &s;hot and &s;mall arms, with the utmo&s;t fury. Arnold led on the attack with his u&s;ual impe|tuo&s;ity, again&s;t a part of his entrenchments into which the light infantry under Lord Balcarres, with a part of the line, had thrown them&s;elves by order. He there met with a brave and ob&s;tinate re&s;i&s;tance. The action continued very warm for &s;ome time, each &s;ide &s;eeming to vie with the other in ardour and per&s;ever|ance. In this critical moment of glory and danger, Arnold was grievou&s;ly wounded, ju&s;t as he was for|cing his way into, or had already entered the works. This could not fail to damp his party, who after long and repeated efforts were finally repul&s;ed.</P>
<PB N="345" REF="352">
<P>Affairs were not &s;o fortunate in another quarter.&mdash; Colonel Breyman, who commanded the German re|&s;erve, being killed, the entrenchment defended by that corps were carried &s;word in hand, and they were to|tally routed with the lo&s;s of their baggage, tents, and artillery. This misfortune was not retrieved, altho' orders for the recovery of the po&s;t were di&s;patched by the General; and his relation of the tran&s;action &s;eems to imply &s;ome blame to tho&s;e who failed in the execution. By this means the enemy gained a dan|gerous opening on our right and rear. The night on|ly put an end to the engagement.</P>
<P>It would &s;eem that nothing could now exceed the di&s;tre&s;s and calamity of the army. They bore it with that excellency of temper, and that unconquerable firmne&s;s and re&s;olution, which are natural to, and were worthy of Briti&s;h &s;oldiers. It was evidently impo&s;|&s;ible to continue in their pre&s;ent &s;ituation, without &s;ubmitting to a certainty of de&s;truction on the en&s;uing day. A total change of po&s;ition was accordingly un|dertaken, and as it &s;eems to have been conceived with great judgment was carried into execution during the night, with a degree of coolne&s;s, &s;ilence, order, and intrepidity, which has &s;eldom been equalled, and will certainly never be exceeded. It was not the movement of a wing or a part, it was a general remove of the whole army, of the camp and artillery, from its late ground to the heights above the ho&s;pital;&mdash; thus, by an entire change of front, to reduce the ene|my to a nece&s;&s;ity of forming an entire new di&s;po&s;ition. All this was accompli&s;hed in the darkne&s;s, and under the doubt and apprehen&s;ion of &s;uch a night, &s;o fatally u&s;hered in, and accompanied throughout with circum|&s;tances of &s;uch uncommon peril, as were &s;ufficient to
<PB N="346" REF="353">di&s;turb the be&s;t formed mind, and to &s;hake the firme&s;t re&s;olution, without lo&s;s, and what was &s;till more, with|out di&s;order.</P>
<P>Many brave men fell on this unfortunate day. The officers &s;uffered exceedingly. Several who had been grievou&s;ly wounded in the late action, and who di&s;|dained an ab&s;ence from any danger in which their fel|lows were involved, were again wounded in this.&mdash; Among tho&s;e of greater note, or who were di&s;tin|gui&s;hed by higher rank, who fell, be&s;ides General Frazer and Colonel Breyman, whom we have men|tioned, Sir James Clarke aid de camp to Gen. Bur|goyne, was mortally wounded and taken pri&s;oner&mdash; Major Williams of the artillery, and Major Ackland of the grenadiers, were al&s;o taken, the latter being wounded. Upon the whole, the li&s;ts of killed and wounded, though avowedly imperfect, and not inclu|ding the Germans, were long and melancholy.</P>
<P>On the next day, the army, being &s;en&s;ible nothing le&s;s than a &s;ucce&s;sful and deci&s;ive action could extricate them from their pre&s;ent difficulties, continued without effect, during its cour&s;e, to offer battle repeatedly in their new po&s;ition, to the enemy. They were pre|paring with great coolne&s;s, the carrying of mea&s;ures into execution, which were le&s;s dangerous, though not le&s;s effectual, than the attack of a brave and de&s;|perate enemy, in &s;trong and fortified ground. A con|tinued &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of &s;kirmi&s;hes were, however, carried on, and the&s;e did not pa&s;s without lo&s;s on both &s;ides.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the Briti&s;h general di&s;covered, that the enemy had pu&s;hed a &s;trong body forward to turn his right, which if effected, he would have been completely enclo&s;ed on every &s;ide. Nothing was left to prevent this fatal con&s;equence, but an immediate
<PB N="347" REF="354">retreat to Saratoga. The army accordingly began to move at nine o'clock at night; and though the move|ment was within mu&s;ket &s;hot of the enemy, and the army encumbered in the retreat with all its baggage, it was made without lo&s;s. A heavy rain which fell that night, and continued on the en&s;uing day, though it impeded the progre&s;s of the army, and increa&s;ed the difficulties of the march, &s;erved at the &s;ame time to re|tard, and in a great mea&s;ure to prevent the pur&s;uit of the enemy. In this unhappy nece&s;&s;ity, the ho&s;pital with the &s;ick and wounded, was of cour&s;e, and mu&s;t have been inevitably abandoned. In this in&s;tance&punc; as well as in every other which occurred in the cour&s;e of the&s;e tran&s;actions, General Gates behaved with an attention and humanity, to all tho&s;e whom the for|tune of war had thrown into his hands, which does honour to his character.</P>
<P>On the &s;ide of the Americans, the lo&s;s in killed and wounded was great; and it is &s;uppo&s;ed exceeded that of the Briti&s;h. They, however, lo&s;t no officer of note; but the Generals Lincoln and Arnold were both dangerou&s;ly wounded.</P>
<P>From the impediments in the march which we have mentioned, the army did not pa&s;s the fords of the Fi&s;h Kill Creek, which lies a little to the northward of Saratoga, until the 10th in the morning. They found a body of the enemy already arrived, and throwing up entrenchments on the heights before them, who retired at their approach over a ford of the Hud&s;on's river, and there joined a greater force, which was &s;tationed to prevent the pa&s;&s;age of the army.&mdash;No hope now remained but that of effecting a retreat, at lea&s;t as far as Fort George, on the way to Canada. For this purpo&s;e,
<PB N="348" REF="355">a detachment of artificers under a &s;trong e&s;cort, was &s;ent forward to repair the bridges, and open the road to Fort Edward. But they were not long departed from the camp, when the &s;udden appearance of the enemy in great force, on the oppo&s;ite heights, with their apparent preparation to pa&s;s the Fi&s;h Kill, and bring on an immediate engagement, rendered it ne|ce&s;&s;ary to recal the 47th regiment, and Frazer's mark&s;men, who, with Mackey's provincials, com|po&s;ed the e&s;cort. The workmen had only commenced the repair of the fir&s;t bridge, when they were aban|doned by their provincial guard, who ran away, and left them to &s;hift for them&s;elves, only upon a very &s;light attack of an incon&s;iderable party of the enemy. All the force of di&s;cipline, and all the &s;tubbornne&s;s derived from its mo&s;t confirmed habits, were now ne|ce&s;&s;ary to &s;upport even the appearance of re&s;olution.</P>
<P>The farther &s;hore of the Hud&s;on's river, was now lined with detachments of the enemy, and the bat|teaux loaded with provi&s;ions and nece&s;&s;aries, which had attended the motions of the army up the river, &s;ince its departure from the neighbourhood of Still Water, were expo&s;ed, notwith&s;tanding any protection which could po&s;&s;ibly be afforded, to the continual fire and attacks of the&s;e detachments. Many boats were taken, &s;ome retaken, and a number of men lo&s;t in the &s;kirmi&s;hes, upon the&s;e occa&s;ions. At length it was found that the provi&s;ions could only be pre|&s;erved by landing and bringing them up the hill to the camp; a labour which was accompli&s;hed under a hea|vy fire with difficulty and lo&s;s.</P>
<P>In the&s;e deplorable circum&s;tances, councils of war were held, to con&s;ider of the po&s;&s;ibility of a further retreat. The only mea&s;ure that carried even the ap|pearance
<PB N="349" REF="356">of practicability, hard, difficult, and dange|rous as it was, was by a night march to gain Fort Ed|ward, the troops carrying their provi&s;ions upon their backs. The impo&s;&s;ibility of repairing the roads and bridges, and of conveying in their pre&s;ent &s;ituation the artillery and carriages, were too evident to admit of a que&s;tion. It was propo&s;ed to force the fords at or near Fort Edward.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t preparations were making for carrying this forlorn and de&s;perate re&s;olve into execution, intelli|gence was received, that the enemy had already with great fore&s;ight, provided for every po&s;&s;ible mea&s;ure, that could be adopted for an e&s;cape, and that this final re&s;ort was accordingly cut off. Be&s;ides, being &s;trong|ly entrenched oppo&s;ite to the fords which it was in|tended to pa&s;s, they had a &s;trong camp, and provided with artillery, on the high and ri&s;ing grounds, be|tween Fort Edward and Fort George; whil&s;t their parties were every where &s;pread along the oppo&s;ite &s;hore of the river, to watch or intercept the motions of the army, and on their own, the enemy's po&s;ts were &s;o clo&s;e, that they could &s;carcely make the &s;malle&s;t movement without di&s;covery.</P>
<P>Nothing could be more deplorably calamitous, than the &s;tate and &s;ituation of the army. Worn down by a &s;eries of hard toil, ince&s;&s;ant efforts, and &s;tubborn ac|tion; abandoned in their utmo&s;t nece&s;&s;ity and di&s;tre&s;s by the Indians; weakened by the de&s;ertion, or di&s;ap|pointed and di&s;couraged by the timidity and inef|ficacy of the Canadians and Provincials; and the re|gular troops reduced by repeated and heavy lo&s;&s;es, of many of their be&s;t men and mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed officers, to the number of only 3,500 effective fighting men, of whom not quite 2,000 were Briti&s;h. In the&s;e cir|cum&s;tances,
<PB N="350" REF="357">and this &s;tate of weakne&s;s, without a po&s;|&s;ibility of retreat, and their provi&s;ion ju&s;t exhau&s;ted, they were inve&s;ted by an army of four times their own number, who&s;e po&s;ition extended three parts in four of a circle round them; who refu&s;ed to fight from a knowledge of their condition; and who from the nature of the ground could not be attacked in any part.</P>
<P>In this helple&s;s condition, obliged to lie con&s;tantly on their arms, whil&s;t a continued cannonade prevaded all the camp, and even rifle and grape &s;hot fell in every part of the lines, the Briti&s;h troops retained their con|&s;tancy, temper, and fortitude, in a wonderful and al|mo&s;t unparalleled manner. As true courage &s;ubmits with great difficulty to de&s;pair, they &s;till flattered them|&s;elves with the hope of &s;uccour from their friends on the New York &s;ide, or, perhaps with not le&s;s fervent wi&s;hes, of an attack from the enemy; thereby to quit all &s;cores at once, and either to have an opportunity of dying gallantly, or extricating them&s;elves with hon|our. In the mean time, the enemy's force was con|tinually increa&s;ed by the pouring in of the militia from all parts, who were all eager to partake of the glory, the &s;poil, or the plea&s;ure of beholding the degradation of tho&s;e whom they had &s;o long dreaded, and whom they unhappily con&s;idered as their mo&s;t implacable enemies.</P>
<P>At length, no &s;uccour appearing, no rational ground of hope of any kind remaining, an exact ac|count of the provi&s;ions was taken on the evening of the 13th of October, when it was found that the whole &s;tock in hand, would afford no more than three days bare &s;ub&s;i&s;tence for the army. A council was immediately called; and the General thinking it
<PB N="351" REF="358">right and ju&s;t, in a matter &s;o momentous to individu|als, as well as the whole, to obtain the general opi|nion and &s;uffrage of the army, &s;o far as it could with propriety be collected, invited, be&s;ides the generals and field officers, all the captains commanding corps or divi&s;ions, to a&s;&s;i&s;t at the council. The re&s;ult was, an unanimous determination to open a treaty and en|ter into a convention with General Gates.</P>
<P>Gen. Gates &s;hewed no marks of arrogance, nor betrayed any &s;igns of being carried away by the pre|&s;ent extraordinary torrent of &s;ucce&s;s. The terms were moderate, con&s;idering the ruined &s;tate and irre|trievable circum&s;tances of the army; and that it was already in effect at the enemy's mercy, being equally incapable of &s;ub&s;i&s;ting where it was, and of making its way to a better &s;ituation. The principal difficulty related to a point of military honour, in which the Briti&s;h generals and troops were peremptory, and Gates far from being &s;tiff.</P>
<P>The principal articles of the convention, exclu&s;ive of tho&s;e which related to the provi&s;ion and accommo|dation of the army, in its way to Bo&s;ton, and during its &s;tay at that place. were, That the army &s;hould march out of the camp with all the honours of war, and its camp artillery, to a fixed place where they were to depo&s;it their arms: to be allowed a free embarkation and pa&s;&s;age to Europe from Bo&s;ton, upon condition of their not &s;erving again in America, during the pre&s;ent war; the army not to be &s;eparared, particu|larly the men from the officers; roll calling and other duties of regularity to be admitted; the officers to be admitted on parole, and to wear their &s;ide arms; all private property to be &s;acred, and the public deli|vered upon honour; no baggage to be &s;earched or
<PB N="352" REF="359">mole&s;ted; all per&s;ons of whatever country, apper|taining to, or following the camp, to be fully com|prehended in the terms of capitulation; and the Ca|nadians to be returned to their own country, liable to its conditions.</P>
<P>General Gates fulfilled all the conditions, &s;o far as he was, or &s;hould be concerned in them, with the ut|mo&s;t punctuality and honour. His humanity and po|litene&s;s, in every part of this bu&s;ine&s;s, have been much celebrated; without a &s;ingle detraction, &s;o far as has yet been heard, from the mo&s;t unfavourable accounts that have been given of his conduct. This was the more prai&s;e worthy, as &s;ome late as well as former circum|&s;tances, had highly enraged the American militia; the army in its la&s;t movements, whether from military nece&s;&s;ity, or the vexation and ill-temper incident to their &s;ituation, or the joint operation of both, having burnt and de&s;troyed many hou&s;es, and &s;ome of them buildings of great value. The extraordinary and &s;e|vere execution which now took place upon the North River, would al&s;o have afforded too much colour for a different mode of conduct. It is even &s;aid, and we do not find it has been contradicted, that this general paid &s;o nice an attention to the Briti&s;h military honour, and to the character and feelings of tho&s;e brave troops who now experienced &s;o deplorable a rever&s;e of for|tune, that he kept his army clo&s;e within their lines, and did not &s;uffer an American &s;oldier to be a witne&s;s to the degrading &s;pectacle of piling their arms.</P>
<P>The Americans &s;tate the whole number who laid down their arms, including Canadians, provincials, volunteers regulars, and irregulars, of all &s;orts, at 752 men. In this number is undoubtedly included, though not &s;pecified, all the artificers, labourers, and
<PB N="353" REF="360">followers of the camp. They al&s;o &s;tate the number of &s;ick and wounded left in the ho&s;pitals at the retreat from the camp near Still Water, to 528 men, and the lo&s;s be&s;ides in the army, in killed, wounded, ta|ken, or de&s;erted, from the 6th of July downwards, to 2,933; the total amount of the&s;e numbers being 9,213 men. By another account, the number is car|ried above ten thou&s;and. They al&s;o got a fine train of artillery, amounting to 35 pieces of different &s;orts and &s;izes.</P>
<P>During the&s;e unfortunate tran&s;actions, Lieutenant General Sir Henry Clinton, conducted his expedition up the North river with great &s;ucce&s;s. He had em|barked about 3000 men for that &s;ervice, accompani|ed by a &s;uitable naval force, con&s;i&s;ting of &s;hips of war, armed gallies, and &s;maller ve&s;&s;els, under the conduct of Commodore Hotham. Their fir&s;t object was the reduction of the forts Montgomery and Clinton, which tho' of con&s;iderable &s;trength, being at that time in a very unguarded &s;tate, it was determined to attempt by a coup de main. They were &s;ituated on either &s;ide of a creek, which de&s;cended from the mountains to the North river, and their communication pre&s;erved by a bridge. Several nece&s;&s;ary motions being made to ma&s;k the real de&s;ign, the troops were landed in two divi&s;ions, at &s;uch a di&s;tance from their object, as occa&s;ioned a con&s;iderable and difficult march through the mountains; which was however calculated and conducted with &s;uch preci&s;ion, that the two detach|ments arrived on the oppo&s;ite &s;ides of the creek, and their &s;eperate attack on the forts, at nearly the &s;ame time. The &s;urprize and terror of the garri&s;ons was increa&s;ed by the appearance of the &s;hips of war, and the arrival and near fire of the gallies, which approach|ed
<PB N="354" REF="361">&s;o clo&s;e as to &s;trike the walls with their oars. The a&s;&s;ault on both &s;ides of the creek was exceedingly vi|gorous, and the impetuo&s;ity of the troops &s;o great, that notwith&s;tanding a very con&s;iderable defence, both the forts were carried by &s;torm. As the &s;oldiers were much irritated, as well by the fatigue they had undergone, and the oppo&s;ition they met, as by the lo&s;s of &s;ome brave and favourite officers, the &s;laugh|ter of the enemy was con&s;iderable.</P>
<P>Upon the lo&s;s of the forts, the rebels &s;et fire to two fine new frigates, and to &s;ome other ve&s;&s;els, which with their artillery and &s;tores were all con&s;umed.&mdash; Another fort called Con&s;titution, was in a day or two after, upon the approach of the combined land and naval force, precipitately &s;et on fire and abandoned.&mdash; General Tryon al&s;o, at the head of a detachment, de|&s;troyed a new and thriving &s;ettlement called Conti|nental Village, which contained barracks for 1500 men, with con&s;iderable &s;tores. The artillery taken in the three forts, amounted to 67 pieces of different &s;izes. A large quantity of artillery and other &s;tores, with ammunition, and provi&s;ions, were al&s;o taken. A large boom and chain, the making of which was &s;up|po&s;ed to have co&s;t 70,000<ABBR>l.</ABBR> and the con&s;truction of which was con&s;idered as an extraordinary proof of American labour, indu&s;try, and &s;kill, was in part de|&s;troyed, and in part carried away.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, the American lo&s;s in value, was probably greater than upon any other occa&s;ion &s;ince the commencement of the war. Their &s;trength and attention were drawn away to the northward, and other things mu&s;t have been neglected, whil&s;t they applied both to the principal object.</P>
<P>Our lo&s;s in killed and wounded was not great as to number, but &s;ome di&s;tingui&s;hed and much lamented
<PB N="355" REF="362">officers fell. Of the&s;e, be&s;ides Lieutenant Colonel Campbell, who commanded the attack on Fort Mont|gomery, Major Sill, was from the general e&s;teem he had acquired through his many excellent qualities, univer&s;ally regretted. Major Grant of the New York volunteers, and Count Grabou&s;ki, a Poli&s;h no|bleman, and aid de camp to General Clinton, were al&s;o &s;lain in the a&s;&s;ault on the&s;e forts.</P>
<P>The expedition did not end with this &s;ucce&s;s. Sir James Wallace, with a flying &s;quadron of light fri|gates, and General Vaughan, with a con&s;iderable detachment of troops, continued, for &s;everal days, their excur&s;ion up the river, carrying terror and de|&s;truction wherever they went. At the very time that General Burgoyne was receiving the mo&s;t favourable conditions for him&s;elf and a ruined army, the fine vil|lage or town of E&s;opus, at no very great di&s;tance, was reduced to a&s;hes, and not a hou&s;e left &s;tanding. The extraordinary deva&s;tation which attended every part of this expedition, of the nece&s;&s;ity of which we are not judges, was productive of a pathetic, but &s;e|vere letter, from General Gates, then in the height of victory, to General Vaughan.</P>
<P>On the approach of Gates, the troops and ve&s;&s;els retired to New York, having di&s;mantled the forts, and for a time at lea&s;t, having left the river defence|le&s;s. But that enterprize, though conducted with conducted with &s;pirit and ability, was of little moment in the general account.</P>
<P>Such was the unfortunate i&s;&s;ue of the northern cam|paign; the event of an expedition which was under|taken with the mo&s;t confident hopes, and for &s;ome time pur&s;ued with very flattering appearances of &s;uc|ce&s;s. It was &s;uppo&s;ed the principal means for the im|mediate
<PB N="356" REF="363">reduction of the colonies; but it has only &s;erved, in conjunction with other operations, which in the fir&s;t in&s;tance have &s;ucceeded better, to demon|&s;trate the difficulties attending the &s;ubjugation of a numerous people at a great di&s;tance, in an exten&s;ive country marked with &s;trong lines, and abounding in &s;trong natural defences, if the re&s;ources of war are not exceedingly deficient, and that the &s;pirit of the people is in any degree proportioned to their &s;itua|tion. It may now, whatever it was in the beginning, be a matter of doubt, whether any &s;uperiority of power, of wealth, and of di&s;cipline, will be found to over-balance &s;uch difficulties.</P>
<P>It would not be ea&s;y at pre&s;ent, as many things nece&s;&s;ary to be known have not yet been fully ex|plained, and improper, as the whole is &s;till a &s;ubject of public inve&s;tigation, to attempt forming any judgment upon the general plan or &s;y&s;tem of this campaign.&mdash; The general conduct of the war this year has alrea|dy undergone much cen&s;ure; and undoubtedly, the &s;ending of the grand army at &s;uch a di&s;tance to the &s;outhward, whil&s;t the inferior was left &s;truggling with in&s;urmountable difficulties in the north, when it would &s;eem that their junction or co-operation, would have rendered them greatly &s;uperior to any force which could have been po&s;&s;ibly brought to oppo&s;e their pro|gre&s;s, &s;eems, in this view of things, not to be ea&s;ily accounted for. It is, however, a &s;ubject, upon which no conclu&s;ive opinion can yet be formed.</P>
<P>To conclude this part of the hi&s;tory of the Ameri|can war it may nece&s;&s;ary to ob&s;erve, that the &s;chemes that were devi&s;ed fru&s;trated them&s;elves. The appoint|ing of General Burgoyne in the place of Sir G. Carle|ton threw a damp upon the progre&s;s of the war upon
<PB N="357" REF="364">the lakes. This officer had the year before carried all things &s;ucce&s;sfully with the greate&s;t judgment, and humanity al&s;o; but all on a &s;udden the management was taken out of his hands, and an officer appointed, who neither knew the country nor the genius of the people; who was indeed brave, but ra&s;h and adven|trous. Though Carleton contributed as much as he could, to the mea&s;ures of the campaign, yet he could not transfu&s;e his own prudence and &s;agacity into ano|ther, nor direct the execution of &s;uch difficult adven|tures, when he was not pre&s;ent. The march was long and difficult, hazardous in every &s;tep and a &s;ingle &s;tep was fatal; great caution was required, and it required the abilities of Sir Guy Carleton, to have directed the foot&s;teps of &s;uch an army through &s;uch a wilderne&s;s, fore&s;ts, and thickets. Of this officer General Wolfe gave the mo&s;t flattering te&s;timony, by &s;etting him on high above all the Briti&s;h officers then known to him. The changing of this officer in a great mea&s;ure fru&s;trated the &s;ucce&s;s of the war upon the lakes.</P>
<P>Another thing which greatly tended to ruin the progre&s;s of General Burgoyne, was the proclamation which he publi&s;hed full of bomba&s;t threatenings of cruelty and &s;laughter. It was this made all the coun|try arm at once in their own defence, when they heard their fate determined in &s;uch a peremptory manner. Had this general contrived a &s;cheme for his own ruin, he could not have done it more effectually than by thus warning the people what he intended to do. It was this proclamation that rouzed the colo|ni&s;ts and made them all run to arms to defend their own lives and tho&s;e of their families, from the hands of &s;avage Indians and more &s;avage Europeans. The murder of Mrs M'Rae, though it was not immed&icirc;ate|ly
<PB N="358" REF="365">known, became like a mill&s;tone about the neck of the Briti&s;h affairs in that quarter ever &s;ince; it both produced a damp upon the minds of the authors of the murther, and kindled the keene&s;t fire of re&s;ent|ment in the brea&s;ts of all the coloni&s;ts. They now &s;aw their fate, and endeavoured all that was in their power to prevent it; every man now became a &s;oldier ready to revenge the blood of his friends upon their murderers. General Burgoyne had not merely an army to combat, but a country of armed men, and could not move a foot but where he was &s;ure to meet an enemy, from the boy of &s;ixteen to the grey hairs of &s;ixty.</P>
<P>The detachments which he &s;ent were al&s;o badly arranged, and proper methods of communication were not ob&s;erved, nor the way &s;ecured for a retreat, in ca&s;e of a defeat; he tru&s;ted to the valour and di&s;ci|pline of his troops, which though exceedingly good, could not perform impo&s;&s;ibilities, as he found in expe|rience. He &s;oon began to find that even the valour of his men was de&s;pi&s;ed, and that they were a&s;&s;aulted and defeated, by men they had mocked, ridiculed, and laughed at. He was truly an object of pity on account of his di&s;tre&s;s, but on account of his folly an object of laughter.</P>
<P>To conclude the hi&s;tory of this year, it may be ne|ce&s;&s;ary to give the Reader an extract of the letters which pa&s;&s;ed between General Burgoyne and General Gates, before the convention at Saratoga, as al&s;o the articles of convention them&s;elves. Lord Howe wrote from on board the Eagle, June 20, 1776 in this man|ner. I cannot, my worthy friend, permit the letters and parcels which I have &s;ent you, to be carried, without adding a word upon the &s;ubject of the injurious extre|mities,
<PB N="359" REF="366">in which our unhappy di&s;putes have engaged us. You will learn the nature of my mi&s;&s;ion from the official di&s;patches which I have recommended to be forwarded by the &s;ame conveyance. Retaining all the earne&s;tne&s;s I ever expre&s;&s;ed to &s;ee our differences ac|commodated, I &s;hall conceive if I meet with the di&s;|po&s;ition of the colonies, which I was once taught to expect, the mo&s;t flattering hopes of proving &s;erviceable in the objects of the king's paternal &s;olicitude, by pro|moting the e&s;tabli&s;hment of la&s;ting peace and union with the colonies. But if the deep rooted prejudices of America, and the nece&s;&s;ity of preventing her trade from pa&s;&s;ing into foreign channels, mu&s;t keep us &s;till a divided people, I &s;hall from every private as well as public motive mo&s;t heartily lament, that it is not the moment wherein tho&s;e great objects of my ambition are to be attained; and that I am to be longer de|prived of an opportunity to a&s;&s;ure you per&s;onally of the regard with which I am your &s;incere and faith|ful &s;ervant, HOWE.</P>
<P>P. S. I was di&s;appointed of the opportunity I ex|pected for &s;ending this letter at the time it was dated, and have ever &s;ince been prevented by calms and con|trary winds, from getting here to inform Gen. Howe of the commi&s;&s;ion with which I have the &s;atisfaction to be charged, and of his being joined in it. Off Sandy Hook, July 12, To Benjamin Franklin, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> Philadelphia.</P>
<P>Upon the thirteenth of July an an&s;wer to this let|ter was &s;ent by Dr. Franklin to Lord Vi&s;count Howe in which there are &s;everal remarks which had they been attended to, might have prevented the &s;hedding of much innocent blood. The tenor of the letter fol|lows:</P>
<PB N="360" REF="367">
<LETTER>
<P>I received &s;afe, the letters your lord&s;hip &s;o kindly forwarded to me, and beg you to accept my thanks. The official di&s;patches to which you refer me, contain nothing more, than what we had &s;een in the act of parliament, viz. offering pardon upon &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, which I was &s;orry to find, as it mu&s;t give your lord&s;hip pain, to be &s;ent &s;o far upon &s;o hopele&s;s a bu&s;ine&s;s. Directing pardon to the coloni&s;ts, who are the very parties injured, expre&s;&s;es indeed, that opinion of our ignorance, ba&s;ene&s;s, and in&s;en&s;ibility, which your un|informed and proud nation has long been plea&s;ed to entertain of us; but it can have no other effect than that of encrea&s;ing our re&s;entment. It is impo&s;&s;ible that we &s;hould think of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to a government, that has with the mo&s;t wanton barbarity and cruelty burnt our defencele&s;s towns in the mid&s;t of winter; ex|cited the &s;avages to ma&s;&s;acre peaceful farmers, and our &s;laves to murder their ma&s;ters; and is even now bringing foreign mereenaries to deluge our &s;ettlements with blood. The&s;e attrocious injuries have extin|gui&s;hed every &s;park of affection for that parent count|ry we once held &s;o dear; but were it po&s;&s;ible for us to forget them it is not po&s;&s;ible for you, I mean the Bri|ti&s;h nation, to forgive the people you have &s;o heavily injured; you can never confide again in the&s;e as fel|low &s;ubjects, and permit them to enjoy equal freedom to whom you know you have given &s;uch ju&s;t cau&s;es of la&s;ting enmity: and this mu&s;t impel you, if we are again under your government, to endeavour the breaking of our &s;pirits by the &s;evere&s;t tyranny, and ob&s;erving by every means in your power, our growing &s;trength and pro&s;perity. But your lord&s;hip mentions the king's paternal &s;olicitude for promoting the e&s;ta|bli&s;hment of la&s;ting peace and union with the colo|nies.
<PB N="361" REF="368">If by peace is here meant, a peace to be en|tered into by di&s;tinct &s;tates, now at war, and his ma|je&s;ty has given your lord&s;hip power to treat with us: of &s;uch peace, I may venture to &s;ay, though without authority, that I think a treaty for that purpo&s;e not quite impracticable, before we enter into foreign al|liances; but I am per&s;uaded you have no &s;uch powers. Your nation, though (by puni&s;hing tho&s;e American governors who have fomented the di&s;cord, rebuilding our burnt towns, and repairing as far as po&s;&s;ible the mi&s;chiefs done us) &s;he might recover a great &s;hare of our regard, and the greate&s;t &s;hare of our growing commerce, with all the advantages of that additional &s;trength to be derived from a friend|&s;hip with us; yet I know too well her abounding pride, and deficient wi&s;dom, to believe &s;he will ever take &s;uch &s;alutary mea&s;ures. Her fondne&s;s for con|que&s;t as a warlike nation, her lu&s;t of dominion as an ambitious one, and her thir&s;t for a gainful monopoly as a commercial one (none of them legitimate cau&s;es of war) will all join to hide from her eyes every view of her true intere&s;t, and will continually goad her on in the&s;e ruinous di&s;tant expeditions, &s;o de&s;tructive, both of lives and of trea&s;ure, that they mu&s;t prove as de|&s;tructive to her in the end, as the Croi&s;ades formerly were to mo&s;t of the nations in Europe. I have not the vanity, my lord, to think of intimidating, by thus predicting the effects of this war, for I know it will in England, have the fate of all former predic|tions, not to be believed till the event &s;hall verify it.</P>
<P>Long did I endeavour, with unfeigned and unwea|ried zeal, to pre&s;erve from breaking, that fine and noble china va&s;e the Briti&s;h empire; for I know,
<PB N="362" REF="369">that being once broken, the &s;eparate parts could not retain even their &s;hare of the &s;trength and value, that exi&s;ted in the whole; and that a perfect re-union of tho&s;e parts could &s;carce ever be hoped for. Your lord&s;hip may po&s;&s;ibly remember the tears of joy that wet my cheek when, at your good &s;i&s;ter's in London, you once gave me expectations that a reconciliation might &s;oon take place. I had the misfortune to find tho&s;e expectations di&s;appointed, and to be treated, as the cau&s;e of the mi&s;chief I was labouring to pre|vent. My con&s;olation under that groundle&s;s and malevolent treatment was, that I retained the friend|&s;hip of many wi&s;e and good men in that country, and among the re&s;t, &s;ome &s;hare in the regard of Lord Howe.</P>
<P>The well-founded e&s;teem, and permit me to &s;ay, affection, which I &s;hall always have for your lord&s;hip, make it painful for me to &s;ee you engaged in conduct|ing a war, the great ground of which as de&s;cribed in your letter, is the nece&s;&s;ity of preventing the Ame|rican trade from pa&s;&s;ing into foreign channels; to me it &s;eems, that neither the ob&s;tinacy nor the retaining of any trade, how valuable &s;oever, is an object for which men may ju&s;tly &s;pill each others blood; that the true and &s;ure means of extending and &s;ecuring commere is the goodne&s;s and cheapne&s;s of commodi|ties; and that the profits of no trade can ever be equal to the expence of compelling it and holding it by fleets and armies. I con&s;ider this again&s;t us, therefore as both <HI>unju&s;t</HI> and <HI>unwi&s;e;</HI> and I am per&s;uaded that cool and di&s;pa&s;&s;ionate po&s;terity will condemn to infamy, tho&s;e who advi&s;ed it; and that even &s;ucce&s;s will not &s;ave from &s;ome degree of di&s;honour, tho&s;e who volun|tarily engaged to conduct it. I know your great mo|tive
<PB N="363" REF="370">of coming hither, was the hope of being in&s;tru|mental in a reconciliation; and believe when you find that to be impo&s;&s;ible, on any terms given you to pro|po&s;e, you will relinqui&s;h &s;o odious a command, and return to a more honourable private &s;tation.</P>

<P>This letter has been truly prophetic, and the warning given in it ought to have been mo&s;t &s;eriou&s;ly con&s;idered by the government: but &s;uch has been the infatuation of the public managers, that they have re|garded no warnings from either their friends or their enemies.</P>
<P>Upon the 13th of October when the treaty was fir&s;t begun General Burgoyne wrote the following card to General Gates. Lieutenant General Bur|goyne is de&s;irous of &s;ending a field officer with a me&s;|&s;age to Major General Gates, upon a matter of high con&s;equence to both armies. He reque&s;ts to be in|formed at what hour General Gates will receive him to-morrow morning. The an&s;wer was, Major Gene|ral Gates will receive a field officer from Lieutenant General Burgoyne at the advanced po&s;ts of the army of the United States, at ten o'clock to-morrow morn|ing from which he will be conducted to head quarters. Dated the Camp of Saratoga, 9 o'clock.</P>
<P>Upon October 14 Major King&s;ton delivered the fol|lowing me&s;&s;age, to Major General Gates. After hav|ing &s;ought you twice, Lieutenant General Burgoyne has waited &s;ome days in his pre&s;ent po&s;ition, deter|mined to try a third conflict, again&s;t any force you could bring to attack him. He is apprized of the &s;u|periority
<PB N="364" REF="371">of your numbers and the di&s;po&s;ition of your troops to impede his &s;upplies, and render his retreat a &s;eene of carnage on both &s;ides. In this &s;ituation he is impelled by humanity, and thinks him&s;elf ju&s;tified by e&s;tabli&s;hed principles and precedents of State, and of war, to &s;pare the lives of brave men upon honourable terms; &s;hould Major General Gates be inclined to treat upon this idea, General Burgoyne will propo&s;e a ce&s;&s;ation of arms during the time nece&s;&s;ary to com|municate the preliminary terms, by which, in any ex|tremity, he and his army would abide.</P>
<LETTER>
<P>In an&s;wer to this the following propo&s;als were made and an&s;wers given by General Burgoyne.</P>
<P N="1">I. General Burgoyne's army being exceedingly reduced by repeated defeats, de&s;ertion, &s;ickne&s;s, &amp;c. their provi&s;ions exhau&s;ted, their military hor&s;es, tents and baggage taken or de&s;troyed, their retreat cut off, and their camp inve&s;ted, they can only be allowed to &s;urrender pri&s;oners of war.</P>
<P>Lieutenant General Burgoyne an&s;wered, that how|ever much reduced his army, they would never admit that their retreat is cut off while they have arms in their hands.</P>
<P N="2">II. The officers and &s;oldiers may have the baggage belonging to them. The generals of the United States never permit individuals to be plundered.</P>
<P N="3">III. The troops under his Excellency General Bur|goyne will be conducted by the mo&s;t convenient route to New England, marching by ea&s;y marches and &s;uf|ficiently provided for by the way.</P>
<P>This article is an&s;wered by General Burgoyne's fir&s;t propo&s;itions, which is here annexed.</P>
<P N="4">IV. The officers will be admitted on parole; may wear their &s;ide arms, and will be treated with the li|berality
<PB N="365" REF="372">cu&s;tomary in Europe, &s;o long as they by pro|per behaviour continue to de&s;erve it; but tho&s;e who are apprehended having broke their parole, as &s;ome Briti&s;h officers have done, mu&s;t expect to be clo&s;e confined. The an&s;wer made to this article was;&mdash; There being no officer in this army under or capable of being under the de&s;cription of breaking parole this article needs no an&s;wer.</P>
<P N="5">V. All public &s;tores, artillery, arms, ammunition, carriages, hor&s;es, &amp;c. mu&s;t be delivered to commi&s;|&s;ioners appointed to receive them.</P>
<P>An&s;. All public &s;tores may be delivered, arms ex|cepted.</P>
<P N="6">VI. The&s;e terms being agreed to, and &s;igned, the troops under his Excellency General Burgoyne's com|mand, may be drawn up in their encampments, where they will be ordered to ground their arms, and may thereupon be marched to the river &s;ide to be pa&s;&s;ed over to Bennington.</P>
<P>An&s;. This article inadmi&s;&s;able in any extremity-Sooner than this army will &s;ubmit to ground their arms in their encampment, they will ru&s;h on the ene|my, determined to take no quarter.</P>

</LETTER>
<P>At &s;un-&s;et Major King&s;ton met the adjutant gene|ral of Major General Gates's army, and delivered the following me&s;&s;age; If General Gates does not mean to recede from the &s;ixth article the treaty ends at once. The army will to a man proceed to any act of de&s;peration rather than &s;ubmit to this article. The ce&s;&s;ation of arms ends this evening.</P>

<P>Major King&s;ton has authority to &s;ettle the place of meeting of officers propo&s;ed. Major King&s;ton &s;ettled it on the ground where Mr Schuyler's hou&s;e &s;tood. In the time of this negotiation General Burgoyne &s;ent the following me&s;&s;age to General Gates:</P>
<P>In the cour&s;e of the night Lieutenant General Bur|goyne has received intelligence that a con&s;iderable force has been detached from the army under Gen. Gates, during the cour&s;e of the negotiations of the treaty depending upon them. Lieutenant General
<PB N="369" REF="376">Burgoyne conceives this, if true, to be not only a vio|lation of the ce&s;&s;ation of arms, but &s;ubver&s;ive of the principles on which the treaty originated, viz. a great &s;uperiority in General Gates's army. Lieutenant General Burgoyne, therefore requires, that two offi|cers, on his part, be permitted, to &s;ee that the &s;trength of the forces, now oppo&s;ed to him is &s;uch as will con|vince him that no &s;uch detachment has been made; and that the &s;ame principle of &s;uperiority, upon which the treaty fir&s;t began &s;till &s;ub&s;i&s;ts.</P>
<P>It does not appear that any an&s;wer was given to this me&s;&s;age. The articles of covention follow.</P>
<P N="1">I. The troops under Lieutenant General Burgoyne, to march out of their camp with the honours of war, and the artillery of the entrenchments to the verge of the river, where the old fort &s;tood, where the arms and artillery are to be left; the arms to be piled up by word of command from their own officers.</P>
<P N="2">II. A free pa&s;&s;age to be granted the army under Lieutenant General Burgoyne, to Great Britain, on condition of not &s;erving again in N. America during the pre&s;ent conte&s;t: and the port of Bo&s;ton is a&s;&s;igned for the entry of tran&s;ports, whenever General Howe &s;hall &s;o order.</P>
<P N="3">III. Should any cartel take place by which the army under General Burgoyne, or any part of it, may be exchanged, the foregoing article to be void, as far as &s;uch exchange &s;hall be made.</P>
<P N="4">IV. The army under Lieutenant General Bur|goyne to march to Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ett's Bay by the mo&s;t ex|peditious and convenient rout; and to be quar|tered in, near, or as convenient as po&s;&s;ible, that the march of the troops may not be delayed when tran&s;|ports arrive to receive them.</P>
<PB N="370" REF="377">
<P N="5">V. The troops to be &s;upplied on their march, and during their being in quarters with provi&s;ions by Ma|jor General Gates's orders, at the &s;ame rate of rations as the troops of his own army; and if po&s;&s;ible, the officers hor&s;es and cattle are to be &s;upplied with fo|rage at the u&s;ual rates.</P>
<P N="6">VI. All officers to retain their carriages, bat hor&s;es, and other cattle; and no baggage to be mole&s;ted or &s;earched, Lieutenant General Burgoyne giving his honour, that there are no public &s;tores &s;ecreted there|in, Major General Gates will of cour&s;e take the ne|ce&s;&s;ary mea&s;ures for a due performance of this article.

<P>This convention, concerning which there appears to have been a great deal of ceremony for very little purpo&s;e, &s;hews more the pride and ambi|tion of the Briti&s;h General, than his wi&s;dom and pru|dence. The requi&s;itions which he made, provided they had not been granted, would have expo&s;ed him and his whole army to certain ruin and de&s;truction; for there was not the lea&s;t probability that he was able to fight &s;uch a &s;uperior force, which knew his weak|ne&s;s, and were provided for any attack that he could have made. He might, as he threatened, have led on his men, and refu&s;ed quarter; but under the pre&s;|&s;ing influence of hunger and fatigue, it is not to be &s;uppo&s;ed they would have gained any thing, except the honour of falling like mad-men, for the &s;ake of a cau&s;e which they never examined, but taken upon the work of their officers and commanders. Men ex|hau&s;ted with hunger and fatigue, fainting under a de|cay of animal &s;pirits, were not &s;oldiers very fit for ru&s;hing upon an enemy, three times their number, and &s;upplied with the needful &s;upplies of nature, which they wanted. General Gates knew well what would have been the con&s;equence, but was unwilling to leave the &s;laughter of a Briti&s;h army, as a monument in hi&s;tory, of the &s;everity of the coloni&s;ts towards their oppre&s;&s;ing brethren. He &s;eems to have humour|ed the Briti&s;h General rather, as one under an infatua|tion, than dealt with him as a general of an army. Gates will be remembered for his humanity, as well as greatne&s;s of &s;oul, while hi&s;tory continues to hand
<PB N="373" REF="380">down the tran&s;actions of mankind to po&s;terity; and the convention of Saratoga will remain a proof, both of his mercy and politene&s;s.</P>
<P>General Burgoyne certainly made as much by this convention as he po&s;&s;ibly could have expected; and much more than his &s;ituation promi&s;ed; but his nice|ne&s;s concerning punctilios, might have marred all his &s;ucce&s;s in it, and brought &s;udden ruin upon a number of brave and innocent men. The mercy of his ene|mies, and the prudence of their commander, wrought more for him than either his own wi&s;dom, or his merit. Had General Gates and his army been in his &s;ituation, there are many rea&s;ons to determine us to think, that he would not have &s;hewn the &s;ame clemen|cy that he him&s;elf met with.&mdash;His daring and bloody proclamation, to &s;et loo&s;e the &s;calping &s;avages upon peaceable and quiet pea&s;ants, who were em|ployed about their rural employments, as our people at home, declared a di&s;po&s;ition that &s;avoured nothing of mercy or clemency: and it would have been no wonder, if they had mea&s;ured to this boa&s;ting officer that mea&s;ure which he threatened to mete out to them. It was however, happy that the &s;word was re&s;trained, and &s;o many lives pre&s;erved; and it ought to teach our commanders to &s;hew more mercy than they have done on &s;ome occa&s;ions. Though our proud nation has declared the&s;e colonies rebels, the re&s;t of Europe have a different opinion of them, &s;ince they became independent; and our cruelty to them, may on &s;ome future occa&s;ion, bring &s;everities upon our own heads.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XIII.</HI> The confu&s;ed &s;tate of the nation at home.&mdash;The Mini&s;try alarmed by the news of the Convention at Saratoga.&mdash; Conceal it as long as they can.&mdash;Occa&s;ions many de|bates in parliament.&mdash;A treaty of commerce between the Colonies and France.</HEAD>
<P>THE national expectations were rai&s;ed to &s;uch an high pitch, with regard to the &s;ucce&s;s of the northern army, that the news of its &s;low operations and embarr$&s;ments, began to operate in creating me|lancholy and apprehen&s;ions of di&s;appointment through|out the whole nation. The progre&s;s of General Bur|goyne in his march from Canada to Albany, was not &s;o rapid and &s;ucce&s;sful as the mini&s;try had given rea|&s;on to expect in their confidence of boa&s;ting. Tho' &s;ome of his advanced parties had been &s;ucce&s;sful and defeated their enemy, yet their own lo&s;s was con&s;i|derable, and their progre&s;s to Albany interrupted by &s;o many accidents, that the people at home be|gan to be unea&s;y, and concluded that the &s;ecrets of this expedition were not fairly repre&s;ented. They had almo&s;t anticipated the whole extent of the di&s;a&s;|ter before the news of it had arrived; and the cata&s;|trophe was not more extraordinary than many fore&s;aw it would happen to be. The whole nation was in an univer&s;al murmur concerning the i&s;&s;ue of this expedi|tion. The friends of the mini&s;ter endeavoured to co|lour tho&s;e delays and di&s;appointments with all their u&s;ual arts of apology, and promi&s;ed &s;anguinely upon
<PB N="375" REF="382">the &s;ucce&s;s of the event, from the caution that was u&s;ed in execution of this project. All their arts were in&s;ufficient to di&s;gui&s;e their own apprehen&s;ions, or to per&s;uade the people that they were not in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of intelligence the mo&s;t unfavourable to the nation and di&s;honourable to them&s;elves. Of all the com|manders that were &s;ent to America, there were none in whom the zealous promoters of the war pla|ced greater hopes and confidence than in Gen. Bur|goyne; his abilities were extolled beyond the ordi|nary bounds of commendation, and it was thought impo&s;&s;ible that any American force could oppo&s;e him. The Scotch nation, who were &s;anguinary promoters of this ruinous war, at the &s;ame in&s;tant that they were reproaching General Howe, pa&s;&s;ed the mo&s;t extrava|gant encomiums upon General Burgoyne. He had threatened the coloni&s;ts with &s;everities, which they approved of, and their &s;anguine hopes made them be|lieve that he was well able to accompli&s;h his threaten|ings. Some accounts that came from America prece|ding the convention at Saratoga, which were not very favourable, were interpreted as reports rai&s;ed by the patriots to weaken the hands of government; and of|ten &s;hipma&s;ters, who arrived at Port Gla&s;gow and Greenock brought tidings of great comfort to the mi|ni&s;try, which were contrived on their voyages, or re|ceived from others, at the &s;econd, third, or fourth hands. The&s;e unauthenticated reports in a &s;hort time lo&s;t all credit, and <HI>even</HI> the Scots, who thought the &s;ucce&s;s of this expedition infallible, began to doubt and waver concerning its &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>General Burgoyne's &s;ucce&s;s at Ticonderago, with the total defeat and ruin which for a &s;ea&s;on every where attended the Americans in their precipitate
<PB N="376" REF="383">flight on the borders of Lake George, excited the greate&s;t triumph and exultation on the &s;ide of the mi|ni&s;try; and whil&s;t it wonderfully rai&s;ed their &s;pirits, was con&s;idered nearly as crowning the hopes of all tho&s;e who had &s;upported or approved of the war. So ready are mankind to be elevated above mea&s;ure with what they fondly wi&s;h for and expect. It was ob&s;erved that the northern expedition was the favour|ite creature of government. The tran&s;actions on the further &s;ide of Jer&s;ey, and the operations about Phi|ladelphia, were only con&s;idered in a very &s;ubordinate point of view. As the mini&s;ter for the American de|partment had all the honour and applau&s;e of this mea|&s;ure, which was con&s;idered entirely as a creature of his own, it is not to be reckoned wonderful, that both he and his brethren in office &s;hould be deeply intere&s;t|ed in the event, and approve them&s;elves highly on the appearance of &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>The &s;ub&s;equent di&s;patches from their favourite Ge|neral did not long &s;upport the hopes which were &s;ounded on the fir&s;t &s;ucce&s;&s;es. The unexpected diffi|culties and delays which the army experienced in ad|vancing a few miles fom Skene&s;borough to the &s;outh|ward, were, however, counterbalanced in opinion by its arrival on the Hud&s;on's River, the retreat of the enemy from the Fort Edward, their abandoning Fort George and the Lake, by which a free pa&s;&s;age was opened from Ticonderago, and St. Leger's &s;ucce&s;s in defeating and ruining the Tryon county militia near Fort Stanwix. All the former and pre&s;ent &s;anguine expectations which had been formed, were however in a great mea&s;ure overthrown by the advices which were received &s;ometime previous to the meeting of parliament; an event which was probably this year
<PB N="377" REF="384">held back in the full confidence of its being u&s;hered in with the particulars of &s;ome great and deci&s;ive &s;uc|ce&s;s. Tho&s;e which came to hand, after a tedious &s;ea&s;on of expectation, bore a very different com|plexion. The in&s;uperable difficulties that nece&s;&s;arily &s;u&s;pended the operations of an army in &s;uch a coun|try, and under &s;uch circum&s;tances, were now practi|cally di&s;covered. The double defeat of Baum and Breyman, by a &s;uppo&s;ed broken and ruined militia, in an attempt to remove or to le&s;&s;en &s;ome of tho&s;e difficul|ties, was &s;till more di&s;piriting, and not in any de|gree cured by the hopes which the General expre&s;&s;ed of &s;upport and a&s;&s;i&s;tance from the co-operation of Sir William Howe's army; both as it marked a de&s;pon|dency of &s;ucce&s;s from their own force, and that the mini&s;ters knew the impo&s;&s;ibility of his receiving any &s;upport from that quarter. But, as if it had been to crown the climax of ill news and ill fortune, the &s;ame di&s;patches were accompanied with others from Sir Guy Carleton, which brought an account of the failure of the expedition to Fort Stanwix, the bold and unex|pected attack of the rebels on the &s;ide of Ticonderago, and of a &s;till more unexpected and extraordinary event in a &s;hort &s;ketch of the de&s;perate and doubtful action which was fought on the 19th of September, between General Burgoyne and Arnold; which, naked as it was of circum&s;tances, &s;eemed to &s;hew the latter to be the a&s;&s;ailant, by the mention of his returning to his camp, when darkne&s;s had put an end to the com|bat.</P>
<P>Although the knowledge of the&s;e events &s;eemed to open a view to &s;ome of the &s;ucceeding misfortunes, and even &s;eemed to pre&s;age a part of the&s;e &s;evere hard&s;hips and calamities which befel the northern ar|my,
<PB N="378" REF="385">it was &s;till hoped by tho&s;e who were mo&s;t &s;an|guine in their expectations, that the General being &s;o near Albany, could not fail in making his march good to that place; and that then being &s;ecurely lodged, he would have an opportunity of concerting matters with Sir Henry Clinton, and of their jointly or &s;eparately di&s;tre&s;&s;ing the northern colonies; or if the &s;ea&s;on and other circum&s;tances did not favour that de&s;ign, they might determine upon the propriety of maintain|ing the po&s;t at Albany, during the winter; or of ad|vancing to New York, if it was thought more eligi|ble. In the wor&s;t ca&s;e that could happen, it was ne|ver doubted but they would be able to make good a retreat to Canada. So great was the faith of the mini&s;try and their &s;anguinary &s;upporters, in the omni|potence of this army, that they judged it impo&s;&s;ible for any force the Americans could &s;end again&s;t them to conquer them; and tho&s;e who hinted the &s;malle&s;t &s;u&s;|picion of the&s;e troops not being invincible, were ready to become the objects of the &s;evere&s;t ridicule. Many for a good while had progno&s;ticated the di&s;a&s;ter which befel this army, and freely declared their &s;entiments; but their mo&s;t rational conjectures were interpreted as proceeding from di&s;affection to the government, and a &s;pirit of rebellion. Many of the old Jacobites, who had now by means of a &s;ecret influence worked them&s;elves into power, or by means of their friends, had &s;lipt into places of &s;inecure, began to &s;peak of rebel|lion in a new &s;tile, and throw the &s;candal of it upon the be&s;t friends of the Briti&s;h con&s;titution. Some of them even proceeded &s;o far as to affirm that the revolution was it&s;elf a rebellion, and that the colo|ni&s;ts were no le&s;s rebels for pleading their rights from that con&s;titution.</P>
<PB N="379" REF="386">
<P>The heroi&s;m of the Frazers, and other chiefs who had made had made but an indifferent figure at Cullo|den was now extoled to the &s;kies, and the Scotch Highlanders under their command were repre&s;ented as the mo&s;t invincible troops in the world. The co|loni&s;ts were &s;et forth in all the ridiculous attitudes of rebellion, cowardice, and in&s;ignificance; &s;o one would have thought that in&s;tead of &s;ending &s;uch irre&s;i&s;table troops to &s;ubdue them, that the very draughts of our army might have &s;erved for that purpo&s;e. There is always an incon&s;i&s;tency in the language and conduct of men when they are under the influence of preju|dice, and ruled by their pride and pa&s;&s;ions; and of all the characters in &s;ociety, there are none &s;o ready to give way to the&s;e unrea&s;onable affections, as tho&s;e who are inclined to the lu&s;t of dominion and arbitrary power. The noble&s;t exertions of the human mind, and the pure&s;t principles of freedom and liberty are an eye-&s;ore to men affected with the lu&s;t of domina|tion.</P>
<P>Amid&s;t the various conte&s;ts and debates in parlia|ment, and the di&s;putes at home concerning the Ame|rican war, the news of the convention at Saratoga, and the &s;urrender of General Burgoyne's whole ar|my threw a con&s;iderable damp upon the confidence of the mini&s;try, and almo&s;t confounded tho&s;e who had exceeded all bounds in their extravagance of boa&s;ting. While parliament were hotly di&s;puting concerning the mea&s;ures to be adopted for carrying on the war, and all rational propo&s;als for an accomodation were re|jected by a dead majority, upon the third of Decem|ber, the di&s;mal news of the &s;urrender of the whole northern army arrived, and the fir&s;t certain accounts thereof were di&s;clo&s;ed by the mini&s;ter who had the
<PB N="380" REF="387">honour of directing it. The a&s;toni&s;hment of all could not exceed the confu&s;ion of the mini&s;ters; they were thunder-&s;truck at the tidings, and a guilty confu&s;ion over&s;pread their countenances. Altho' not convinced of their error, nor converted from principles which are a di&s;grace to human nature, they almo&s;t gna&s;hed their teeth for pain, and were reduced to feel the ago|nies of condemnation. Though the lo&s;s of &s;o many brave men and citizens was much to be lamented, yet the indignation of the people, and the ignorance, wick|edne&s;s, and folly of the contrivers of that unju&s;t and horrid war, carried off a great degree of the &s;orrow which many felt at the lo&s;s and di&s;grace of our army. As our troops were taken pri&s;oners of war, &s;ome thought it more fortunate than if they had been killed in battle, in a cau&s;e, the orthodoxy of which had never yet been fully demon&s;trated by the mo&s;t &s;anguine ad|vocates thereof.</P>
<P>It may ea&s;ily be &s;uppo&s;ed that tho&s;e who had been from the beginning again&s;t that bloody and unrea&s;on|able war, would be ready to let the mini&s;try hear of the folly and weakne&s;s of their mea&s;ures. The mini|&s;ter's declaration in the Hou&s;e of Commons concerning the convention of Saratoga, brought forth the &s;evere&s;t as well as the mo&s;t ju&s;t and equitable charges again&s;t him. The principle and policy of the war were arraigned, and the incapacity of the mini&s;try to carry it on, &s;uppo&s;e it had been ju&s;t, was painted in the &s;tronge&s;t colours. The whole plan of the expedition was condemned in the &s;tronge&s;t terms; it was declared an ab&s;urd, incon|&s;i&s;tent and impracticable &s;cheme, and which the chief of a tribe of &s;avages would have been a&s;hamed to ac|knowledge. The hero of his &s;cheme was told that they did not judge him from events, but had warned him
<PB N="381" REF="388">of the fatal con&s;equences of his plan before this event had happened. That they had been laughed at for warning him of what had happened, and told that they were &s;peaking by prophecy. The a&s;ked him if he was now &s;atisfied with the truth of their prophe|cies and predictions. They affirmed that ignorance had &s;tamped every &s;tep of the expedition, but it was the ignorance of the mini&s;ter, and not of the general; a mini&s;ter that would venture &s;itting in his clo&s;et, not only to direct the general operations, but all the parti|cular movements of a war carried on in the interior de&s;arts of America, and at the di&s;tance of three thou|&s;and miles.</P>
<P>The northern expedition was perhaps as ill-contriv|ed and un&s;ucce&s;sfully executed, as any that is record|ed in hi&s;tory. The pretended de&s;ign of it was to form a junction between Sir William Howe and Gene|ral Burgoyne, through woods and de&s;arts, rivers and lakes; where many large ve&s;&s;els were to be built, many exten&s;ive woods to be cut through, and roads continu|ally impa&s;&s;able, to be levelled, mended, and repaired. This mea&s;ure might have been effected by &s;ea in le&s;s than a month, without much danger, and at a more moderate expence. But the ignorance, and &s;tupidity of the contriver of this expedition is beyond all pa|rallel in hi&s;tory; for at the very time that he intend|ed that the two armies &s;hould join, he ordered the one army to march from New York to the &s;outhward, and commanded the northern army from Canada to follow it. This was a &s;trange method for the&s;e two bodies to meet in any center, to march in the &s;ame line of direction after each other; but this mini&s;ter, who ever &s;ince his &s;ervice in the la&s;t war had formed ideas of military operations, different from all others
<PB N="382" REF="389">of mankind, was now determined to practi&s;e accord|ing to his own plan of manoeuvres. He perceived by a kind of intuition all the woods and &s;wamps in Ame|rica, and had &s;o formed his plan of operation, that the General was not at liberty to deviate one inch from his appointment. In this re&s;pect, the General was altogether cramped in his commi&s;&s;ion, and was under the nece&s;&s;ity either to run headlong to his own de|&s;truction, or to di&s;obey the orders of his &s;uperiors.&mdash; Perhaps the commander in chief in this expedition o|ver-rated his own abilities, and ra&s;hly engaged to per|form a ta&s;k which he had not perfectly examined, nor thoroughly under&s;tood; and he is greatly to be blam|ed for per&s;i&s;ting to execute a plan which he found concerted by folly, ignorance, and ambition. No General who knew the duties of his office would have engaged to pur&s;ue the plan of any mini&s;ter of &s;tate, without having a di&s;cretionary power of directing the &s;ubordinate mea&s;ures according to the be&s;t of his own judgment.</P>
<P>It was fully perceived by all di&s;cerning per&s;ons, that the mini&s;ter had no &s;ettled plan of the American war, though he ob&s;tinately per&s;i&s;ted in carrying it on, and would not deviate from the &s;everal &s;chemes of his own folly and ignorance, which he had begun. Whether he was the dupe of fal&s;e information, or wilfully contrived incon&s;i&s;tencies, is not altogether evident; but his own account of the &s;tate of America was glaringly prepo&s;terous. At one time he gave out that they were only a trifling mob, and that nine-tenths of the people were zealous for government;&mdash; and yet what is exceedingly &s;trange, this large and va&s;t majority &s;uffered them&s;elves to be fleeced and dri|ven like &s;heep by that ragged handful of their own
<PB N="383" REF="390">rabble. The next day, when all the feudal dungeons of Germany were to be &s;coured for military &s;laves to cut the throats of the&s;e rebels, and the &s;ub&s;tance of Britain exhau&s;ted to maintain them, the Americans were become numerous, and powerful. The delu&s;ion was become highly contagious, and they were to be brought to their &s;en&s;es by nothing &s;hort of the exer|tion of the whole &s;trength of the mother country.&mdash; We were again told that the coloni&s;ts were all cow|ards; that the &s;ight of an Engli&s;h grenadier, was &s;uffi|cient to throw a whole province into a panic; but what &s;eemed &s;trangely incon&s;i&s;tent, was, that near 60,000 men, with an immen&s;e naval force, &s;hould be &s;ent to reduce the&s;e cowards and poltroons. This &s;ort of incon&s;i&s;tency plainly &s;hewed, that the mini&s;try had no true intelligence of matters of fact, but were ready to believe tho&s;e &s;lavi&s;h wretches their governors in America, who only told them &s;tories agreeable to their depraved inclinations, and &s;uited their lies to their own intere&s;t, and the ambition of the court.</P>
<P>The affair of Saratoga, was a di&s;mal commentary upon the ignorance and incon&s;i&s;tency of the Minden Hero and his brethren; he could not now deny that one of the be&s;t appointed armies that ever had been &s;ent from Europe to America had been obliged to de|liver up their arms, and &s;urrender to tho&s;e that he had repre&s;ented as a contemptible rabble, without di&s;|cipline. It was now that the mini&s;ters began to talk of peace, and to affirm what all the world know to be fal&s;e, that they were inclined to peace from the begin|ning; but the truth of the matter was, they could not tell what to &s;ay: they were catched in their own &s;nare, and entangled in toils of their own making.&mdash; They now began to feel that the American war was
<PB N="384" REF="391">a very &s;erious affair, and produced events totally beyond the reach of their apprehen&s;ion. But what methods to pur&s;ue were not ea&s;ily to be determined; they had no wi&s;dom to devi&s;e proper plans; they had no de&s;ire for peace, and they knew not how to carry on the war. Their enemies began now to collect all their mi&s;carriages, and point out their cau&s;es. Among many others, the hiring and employing &s;avages was ful|ly di&s;cu&s;&s;ed; and it mu&s;t be allowed that this mea&s;ure will, as long as the hi&s;tory thereof is handed down to po&s;terity, di&s;grace the pre&s;ent reign, and tho&s;e mini|&s;ters that promoted it. The &s;ums &s;pent in hiring &s;a|vages were enormous, and their &s;ervice rather hurtful than u&s;eful to tho&s;e who employed them, and a di&s;|grace to any government. Their method of making war is horrible, and &s;hocking to the manners of all ci|vilized nations: it far exceeds the ferocity of any other barbarions that have been recorded by either ancient or modern hi&s;tory. The&s;e &s;avages have but two principal objects in all their wars; the one is the in|dulgence of their native cruelty, by the de&s;truction, or if po&s;&s;ible, the extermination of their enemies; and the other, which depends upon the former, is the glo|ry of acquiring the greate&s;t number of &s;calps, which are hung up and pre&s;erved with the greate&s;t care in their huts, as perpetual trophies of victory, conque&s;t, and per&s;onal prowe&s;s.</P>
<P>As they have neither pecuniary emoluments, nor tho&s;e honorary titles or di&s;tinctions which are &s;o flat|tering in civilized nations, to be&s;tow, the rewards of danger and warfare con&s;i&s;ts in human &s;calps, in human fle&s;h, and the gratifications ari&s;ing from torturing, mangling, roa&s;ting alive by &s;low fires, and frequently even devouring their captives. The&s;e are the re|wards

<PB N="385" REF="393">of Indian warriors, and &s;uch are the horrors of an Indian war. There is one apology which the mi|ni&s;try made for employing the &s;avages, namely, that if his Maje&s;ty had not employed them, that the rebels would have done it. But this, like many others of their apologies, was without all foundation. There was no proof or evidence that the coloni&s;ts ever in|tended to employ the&s;e barbarians, or had they ever attempted to enter into any offen&s;ive alliance with them. All that ever they de&s;ired of them was, that they would ob&s;erve a &s;trict neutrality, and be quiet.&mdash; They had actually entered into a treaty of neutrality with the five famous Indian nations, which our mini|&s;try had bribed to violate, and to act offen&s;ively again&s;t the colonies. At the very time the Americans were entering into treaties of neutrality with as many of the &s;avages as they could per&s;uade to that mea&s;ure, the Briti&s;h agents under the direction of the mini&s;try, were hiring the barbarians to de&s;troy the &s;ubjects of the empire from one end of America to another.&mdash; This was demon&s;trated by &s;everal papers that came be|fore the Hou&s;e of Commons.</P>
<P>The wickedne&s;s of this infernal &s;cheme will cleave to the authors of it, and, like a mil&s;tone, &s;ink down to de&s;truction all the other mea&s;ures that ever they &s;hall be engaged in; for the hi&s;tory of mankind cannot &s;hew a &s;ingle in&s;tance where providence ever honour|ed any per&s;ons by being in&s;truments of doing good, who had wilfully and ob&s;tinately per&s;i&s;ted in doing &s;o much evil. For the &s;ake of having the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of &s;avage butchers to ma&s;&s;acre old men, women, and children, the government paid the enormous &s;um of 150,000<ABBR>l.</ABBR> though they never could bring above 7 or 800 of them into the field. It is a thing beyond all
<PB N="386" REF="394">di&s;pute, that it was not the intention of the mini&s;try to qua&s;h what they called rebellion, but to extirpate the whole race of tho&s;e malcontents in America.&mdash; For if it had been their intention to have put an end to the rebellion, they would undoubtedly have pur&s;u|ed wi&s;er mea&s;ures than they have ever yet done. It affords but a melancholy reflection to the &s;ubjects of Great Britain to find that the morality of this war is always put out of the que&s;tion, and the nece&s;&s;ity for carrying it on is urged upon principles that would di&s;grace Indian &s;avages. We have pa&s;&s;ed the Rubicon, and have entered the field of di&s;grace and ruin, and for that rea&s;on we mu&s;t not retract, but go on from evil to wor&s;e. Such principles of action, when read in hi&s;tory by impartial future ages, will make our po&s;|terity &s;hudder to think from what a &s;trange race of men they have de&s;cended.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the folly and madne&s;s of all the &s;chemes of the mini&s;try concerning this war, the prime mini&s;ter in the Hou&s;e of Commons had the effrontery to declare, "that events had turned out very differ|ently from what he had rea&s;on to expect." It is not ea&s;y to &s;ay what idea &s;ome men have of providence, but if this mini&s;ter actually believes that there is a di|vine providence, he could have no rea&s;on to believe that things would fall out otherwi&s;e than they have happened; for among all the rea&s;ons a&s;&s;igned for this unju&s;t and unrighteous war, there is not one that any &s;ober man could &s;atisfy his con&s;cience with, or declare was worthy of the blood of one &s;ingle &s;ubject.</P>
<P>As the mini&s;try now on account of nece&s;&s;ity, began to think of terms of reconciliation with the colonies, a great part of the public debates of parliament, and di&s;putes through the nation, were employed on that
<PB N="387" REF="395">&s;ubject.&mdash;The bill it&s;elf, and the commi&s;&s;ioners ap|pointed to manage the negociation did not promi&s;e fair for a reconciliation;&mdash;they were all the meane&s;t creatures of the court, and of the mini&s;try that were appointed to this commi&s;&s;ion: and though in their own e&s;teem and that of their friends, they were con&s;i|dered great men, yet no particular action of their whole lives had &s;o di&s;tingui&s;hed them as to give a &s;anc|tion to their appointment. The whole of this pro|ceeding was con&s;idered by wi&s;e men rather as a mi|ni&s;terial farce, than a real intention of reconciliation with the colonies. It was ea&s;ily for&s;een what would be the i&s;&s;ue of this comic opera, both from the &s;ea|&s;on in which it was propo&s;ed to be acted, as well as from the wi&s;dom of the managers, and the abilities of the actors on the &s;ide of Great Britain. A treaty was already concluded between France and America, which was not likely to be di&s;annulled by the con|gre&s;s for the &s;ake of plea&s;ing a mini&s;try that had wan|tonly and cruelly &s;hed the blood of their be&s;t and near|e&s;t friends and relations. Nor were they likely to break their faith and their fir&s;t public treaty with a new ally, and &s;o expo&s;e their infidelity to all the world, for the advantage of a parent &s;tate, that had behaved as a barbarous and cruel &s;tep-mother. And &s;uppo&s;e there had been no &s;uch ob&s;tacles in the way, was it probable that they would li&s;ten to any terms from the pre&s;ent mini&s;try or their agents. The whole of this political farce was con&s;idered as only a &s;cheme to wa&s;te a little money upon a needy nobleman and other two mini&s;terial favourites. One of which had for &s;ome time gained the confidence of the people by acting the hypocrite, and had been in training by the mover of the puppets for &s;ome years, and was judged worthy to
<PB N="388" REF="396">act a part in this new comedy. The whole of the proceedings at home concerning this conciliatory bill, convinced all parties before the commi&s;&s;ioners depart|ed what would be the &s;ucce&s;s of their commi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>While matters were agitated at home according to the different humours and di&s;po&s;itions of party, a &s;ort of key to the commi&s;&s;ioners with re&s;pect to their &s;uc|ce&s;s, was &s;ent through the medium of General Bur|goyne to the Earl of Thanet, by General Gates, one of the commanding officers in the American &s;ervice. This conquering General declares his concern at the unhappy rupture between the mother country and the colonies, and &s;ays that he could not help feeling for the misfortunes brought upon his native country by the wickedne&s;s of that admini&s;tration who began and had continued that unju&s;t, impolitic, cruel, and unnatural war. He &s;tates, that the di&s;membering of the empire, the lo&s;s of commerce, of power and con|&s;equence among&s;t the nations, with the downfall of public credit, are but the beginnings of tho&s;e evils which mu&s;t inevitably be followed by a thou&s;and more, unle&s;s timely prevented by &s;ome lenient hand, &s;ome &s;tate phy&s;ician, with the firmne&s;s, integrity, and the abilities of a Chatham, joined to the wi&s;dom, vir|tue, and ju&s;tice of a Cambden. Such a man, he ob|&s;erved, aided by per&s;ons as independent in their for|tunes as un&s;ullied in their honours, and who never bowed their heads to Baal, might yet &s;ave the &s;inking &s;tate. But that great object could only be obtained, he added, by confirming that independency, which the people of the continent of America were deter|mined only to part with along with their lives. Such a mini&s;ter, he &s;aid, would do as all other wi&s;e &s;tate&s;|men had done before him. He would be true to the
<PB N="389" REF="397">intere&s;ts and welfare of his country, and by re&s;cinding the re&s;olutions pa&s;&s;ed to &s;upport that &s;y&s;tem which no power on earth can e&s;tabli&s;h, he will endeavour to re|&s;tore &s;o much of the empire in pro&s;perity and honour as the circum&s;tances of the times and the mal-admini|&s;tration of tho&s;e who ruled before him, have left to his government. The United States of America were, he &s;aid, willing to be the friends, but would never &s;ubmit to be the &s;laves of the parent &s;tate. They are, &s;aid he, by con&s;anguinity, by commerce, by language, and by affections, which naturally &s;pring from the&s;e, more attached to England than to any other country under the &s;un. Therefore, added he, &s;purn not the ble&s;&s;ing that yet remains. In&s;tantly withdraw your fleets and armies, cultivate the friend&s;hip and com|merce of America. Thus and thus only can England hope to be great and happy. Seek that in a commer|cial alliance; &s;eek it ere it be too late, for there only you mu&s;t expect to find it. The&s;e were hints which the mini&s;try might have profited by, had not the things that belonged to their own, and the nations peace been $hid from their eyes.</P>
<P>After the&s;e hints, and others of the like kind that had been frequently given by the greate&s;t authority in America, it was altogether vain to &s;end commi&s;&s;ioners with any other powers than what had an immediate relation to grant fully and freely tho&s;e leading objects of this great conte&s;t. The commi&s;&s;ioners were far from men of either the character or capacity of a Chatham or a Cambden, and the mini&s;try were far from granting &s;uch powers as were nece&s;&s;ary to ac|compli&s;h a reconciliation. This letter which was in|tended as a friendly hint to Great Britain, was not al|lowed to be read in the hou&s;e where is was commu|nicated.
<PB N="390" REF="398">This had no friendly a&s;pect, at a time when commi&s;&s;ioners were going to America to treat about reconciliation; and it plainly &s;hewed, that di&s;&s;imula|tion and hypocri&s;y were at the foundation of the whole proceeding. There could be no more di&s;honour in reading a letter &s;ent by a rebel officer, than in &s;ending commi&s;&s;ioners to negociate with rebel &s;tates. But when men once fall into the maze of incon&s;i&s;tency, there is no end of their wandering. The Briti&s;h mi|ni&s;try wanted one e&s;&s;ential principle nece&s;&s;ary in all reconciliations, and that is, the &s;pirit of forgivene&s;s: they were determined at the &s;ame time that they pro|po&s;ed a reconciliation, to remember their old claims, and indulge the &s;uppo&s;ition of rebellion and di&s;affec|tion in the character of the coloni&s;ts. And it would require more charity than the nature of the thing ad|mits of, for tho&s;e that are any way acquainted with the characters of the Briti&s;h mini&s;try to believe that they intended &s;incerely to promote a reconciliation.&mdash; Had they actually intended to have promoted this de|&s;irable end, they would have withdrawn their fleets and armies, and &s;hewed &s;ome &s;igns of forgivene&s;s by removing the objects of terror and de&s;truction. This would have intimated a di&s;po&s;ition of being reconciled, and inclined the minds of the Americans to have li&s;tened to an accomodation. But men coming with arms in their hands, did not &s;hew very &s;ignificant marks of reconciliation. It was generally &s;uppo&s;ed that the influence of contractors, and other mini&s;terial tools, a &s;ort of political vermin, that live upon the ruin and &s;ores of the public, had a mighty hand in pre|venting the &s;ucce&s;s of all conciliatory mea&s;ures, by vo|ting on the &s;ide of every motion that any way tend|ed to clog the negociation. Among the&s;e devourers
<PB N="391" REF="399">of the community, the rea&s;onablene&s;s of the war and the honour of the nation, were con&s;tant topics of ar|gument, when their real meaning was their own inte|re&s;t and emolument. While parliament were debat|ing concerning a method of reconciliation, the French had actually &s;igned a treaty of commerce with the Americans, and had a fleet ready to &s;ail to &s;upport it. Of all this the mini&s;try were either ignorant, or at lea&s;t pretended to be &s;o; and when they were requir|ed to &s;peak explicitly upon the &s;ubject, replied they had only heard of the&s;e things. It was not long till the mini&s;ter was obliged to bring the French King's declaration into the Hou&s;e, with many grievous com|plaints of the treachery of the French, and their per|fidy in breaking the faith of treaties. This was con|&s;idered as a de&s;erved rub to the mini&s;ter and the am|ba&s;&s;ador at Paris, who had not endeavoured to be bet|ter informed concerning matters of &s;o great import|ance to the nation. As to the breach of faith in tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ing treaties, it did not appear that there was any treaties that con&s;idered the American independence as forbidden in it; or that the French might not enter into a treaty with the&s;e coloni&s;ts, provided they were free &s;tates, as well as England did with the States of Holland. The charge of perfidy, &s;uppo&s;ing the French might in former ca&s;es have de&s;erved it, could not in this be &s;o well applied to them; and it was con&s;idered as mini&s;terial cant u&s;ed in all ca&s;es when nations enter|ed into war.</P>
<P>The doctrine of French perfidy was fully publi&s;hed by the friends of the mini&s;ter, more with a de&s;ign to inflame the nation again&s;t the Americans than again&s;t the Hou&s;e of Bourbon. It was believed that the peo|ple in general would now con&s;ider the war in a new
<PB N="392" REF="400">light, and engage heartily again&s;t the coloni&s;ts, be|cau&s;e they had entered into a treaty with the French King. Whatever might be the &s;ecret views and de|&s;igns of the parties, yet there appeared nothing in the face of the public tran&s;actions, uncommon, unju&s;t, or unrea&s;onable. The mini&s;try had by a cour&s;e of vio|lent and uncon&s;titutional mea&s;ures drive the coloni&s;ts to a &s;tate of independency, and they had now pub|li&s;hed that independency, and declared them&s;elves free &s;tates to the world. In the view of the powers of Eu|rope, the American colonies belonged no more to Great Britain than the United States of Holland be|longed to the Spani&s;h monarchy; they could not in entering into any treaty with the thirteen colonies, or &s;tates in America, be con&s;idered as guilty of infring|ing any treaty that had been formerly made between any nations in Europe, unle&s;s this ca&s;e had been ex|pre&s;&s;ed in &s;uch a treaty. It was undoubtedly as lit|tle imagined by any &s;tate in Europe that Great Bri|tain would have behaved &s;o impolitically as to drive her colonies to the &s;tep they had now taken, as that it is unju&s;t for any power in Europe to enter into a treaty of commerce with them. The whole force of this charge of perfidy depends upon the ju&s;tice of our conduct with America, and of her right to declare her&s;elf independent, when &s;he could not po&s;&s;e&s;s tho&s;e natural rights which the laws of England have &s;ecur|ed to all the &s;ubjects of the Briti&s;h empire. It might not even be incumbent upon the French to enquire into the nature of the claims of parties; the que&s;tion which they principally were concerned to know was, the matter of fact, whether the coloni&s;ts were inde|pendent &s;tates? If Great Britain in her hour of fol|ly and madne&s;s, had driven them from her, it was no
<PB N="393" REF="401">perfidy in any other nations to &s;erve their own intere&s;t by entering into a commercial negociation with them.</P>
<P>The idea of the treachery of the French, and that now the cau&s;es of the war were changed, or at lea&s;t in &s;ome mea&s;ure altered, produced a wonderful change upon the minds of many who otherwi&s;e di&s;approved the proceedings again&s;t the Americans. Some by confounding the ideas of the ju&s;tice of the American re&s;i&s;tance, with tho&s;e of the inju&s;tice of the French in|terference, began to view them as one object, and thought that the whole was now a French war:&mdash; and others through the hope of particular gain, en|gaged heartily in the conte&s;t, and commenced ho&s;tili|ties for the &s;ake of plunder. A great number of pri|vateers were fitted out by combinations of merchants, and gentlemen, to di&s;tre&s;s the trade of the French, under the notion that the French were their enemies for making a treaty with the coloni&s;ts, by which their monopoly of trade was interrupted. The ju&s;tice and morality of the cau&s;e were totally put out of the que&s;tion, and private intere&s;t was the grand &s;pring of action and leading motive for man&s;laughter, blood|&s;hed, and plunder.</P>
<P>The convention of Saratoga had for &s;ome time been matter of altercation at home; the troops who were made pri&s;oners of war had not been &s;ent home according to agreement, and the mini&s;terial writers were now bu&s;ily employed in publi&s;hing the perfidy of the Americans, as well as the treachery of the French. The cau&s;e and circum&s;tances of this delay were not as yet known in Britain, and every one was left to in|dulge his own conjecture. As nothing could be affirm|ed for certain, the hirelings of the mini&s;try, who&s;e con&s;ciences generally are not very &s;crupulous with re|gard
<PB N="394" REF="402">to truth, &s;ounded with a loud alarm, that all the articles of convention had been broken by the con|gre&s;s, and they, as well as the French, were a faithle&s;s as well as rebellious a&s;&s;embly. As circum&s;tances con|cerning this tran&s;action were not &s;ufficiently known for impartial per&s;ons to form a judgment upon, the&s;e &s;criblers were &s;ufferered to go on without any reply or contradiction. The ground of this accu&s;ation was a complaint of the Briti&s;h officers concerning their quarters near Bo&s;ton, as being neither conformable to their expectation nor rank, or to the terms of conven|tion and capitulation. Upon this head, General Bur|goyne in his complaint to the congre&s;s, had expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf in &s;trong terms, which they con&s;idered as charging them with a violation of the conditions of the convention, and with a de&s;ign in him and his men to con&s;ider the capitulation as broken; for as he had charged them with infringing the articles, they con|ceived that he did not con&s;ider him&s;elf bound by them, when once he and his men were out of their power&mdash; They al&s;o in&s;i&s;ted that they had &s;ufficient rea&s;ons to be|lieve that the &s;oldiers had not delivered up all their ac|coutrements, which they con&s;idered as a breach of the articles of capitulation. Their re&s;olution upon this head the writers of the Annual Regi&s;ter call a paltry re&s;olution, &s;hameful in its nature, and highly di&s;grace|ful to the congre&s;s. But the&s;e authors ought to have remembered that tho&s;e that are unfaithful in little will al&s;o be unfaithful in much; and one article of conven|tion is really as binding as another. The charge of infringing the capitulation depends upon the matters of fact, whether the men did &s;ecret their accoutre||ments, or whether the Americans could really afford the Briti&s;h officers as good quarters as they thought
<PB N="395" REF="403">they had rea&s;on to expect from their rank, and the terms of capitulation? The authors already mention|ed are obliged to acknowledge, that the Briti&s;h com|manders had made a requi&s;ition of &s;ome deviation from the terms of convention, which they &s;ay was ra|ther unlucky in point of time. They had reque&s;ted the embarkation of the convention troops, either at the &s;ound, near New York, or at Rhode I&s;land, in|&s;tead of Bo&s;ton, which was the place appointed for their departure. And in con&s;equence of the hope entertained that this propo&s;al would have been com|plied with, the tran&s;ports for the conveyance were a&s;|&s;embled at Rhode I&s;land. The congre&s;s refu&s;ed to comply with this requi&s;ition, alledging that it afford|ed grounds of &s;u&s;picion, that the mea&s;ure was propo|&s;ed merely to afford an opportunity to the convention troops, to join their fellows with an intention of mak|ing &s;ome pretence for evading or breaking the terms of capitulation, and continuing to act in America to the great detriment of the common cau&s;e. What con|firmed this &s;u&s;picion, they &s;aid, was, that the 26 tran&s;ports which were provided at Rhode I&s;land were in&s;ufficient for the conveyance of 5 or 6000 men in a winter voyage to Europe: and that in the pre&s;ent &s;tate of things, with re&s;pect to provi&s;ions both in the Bri|ti&s;h fleet and army, it was &s;carcely po&s;&s;ible that they could have been victualled for &s;o long a voyage and &s;o great a number of men in &s;o &s;hort a time. When all the&s;e things are con&s;idered it will not appear &s;o plain that the Americans tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed the articles of convention; but that if there was any infringement of them, that it was on the part of Great Britain and her officers. But what confirms the matter, that the coloni&s;ts did not break the convention, is, what Gene|ral Burgoyne declared in the Hou&s;e of Commons,
<PB N="396" REF="404">namely, that the convention was not broken, but &s;u&s;|pended, which was owing to our own government not ratifying the agreement. It appears now perfectly clear from what that General hath him&s;elf acknow|ledged, that the Americans have had good rea&s;ons for what they have done; and all that the hirelings of the court have &s;aid is no more than that common &s;lander which they threw forth again&s;t all whom they do not con&s;ider in their intere&s;t.</P>
<P>The coloni&s;ts on their part accu&s;e our armies of the greate&s;t barbarities and cruelty, which they executed upon inoffen&s;ive women, old men, and children, un|provoked, and for no rea&s;on, unle&s;s to &s;atisfy an innate principle of wanton &s;avagene&s;s, equal to that of their brethren of the Indian tribes. It were to be wi&s;hed that the Briti&s;h troops had behaved with more huma|nity, both for the &s;ake of their own character and that of the nation they belonged to; but when the cau&s;es and fir&s;t principles of the war are con&s;idered, the ex|ecution and effects of it could not be well expected to be otherwi&s;e than they have happened. The Ame|ricans were fir&s;t painted in all the ugly and dete&s;tible colours of di&s;affection and rebellion, and repre&s;ented as a people of the mo&s;t abominable and factious princi|ples; unworthy of favour, fair play, or even exi&s;t|ence. Men in a military profe&s;&s;ion are not in gene|ral over nice in examining the truth of government de&s;criptions; they are its &s;ervants, and reckon them|&s;elves obliged to obey the mandates thereof implicitly. The &s;everal acts of &s;everity which they commit, they generally impute to their orders, and con&s;ider the actions and the guilt which attends them, the proper|ty of their employers. Slaughter to them appears in the &s;ame light with their other military exerci&s;es, a ne|ce&s;&s;ary
<PB N="397" REF="405">effect of &s;uperior command, for which the fir&s;t authority is only accountable. The burning of Ae&s;o|pus, and killing &s;o many unarmed people, though it may appear to tho&s;e who view objects in a moral light as &s;hockingly cruel, in the fir&s;t in&s;tance, yet to &s;oldiers it appears no more than an accident of war, with which no man's con&s;cience was concerned.</P>
<P>It is &s;omewhat &s;urpri&s;ing, that the humanity with which General Gates treated General Burgoyne and his army, &s;hould not have had &s;ome effect upon the fu|ture conduct of our army, and made them more mer|ciful to people who had &s;hewn &s;o much clemency to their brethren. Yet all this favour and politene&s;s &s;hewn by the coloni&s;ts was repaid by fre&s;h and repeat|ed acts of military barbarity. Such is the caprice of erroneous principles when once they are a&s;&s;umed, that they di&s;po&s;e men to rea&s;on prepo&s;terou&s;ly and to draw conclu&s;ions that cannot be ju&s;tly inferred from any data given in rea&s;on or human nature. It was ar|gued in defence of Briti&s;h cruelty that the objects thereof were rebels, and that no cruelty to &s;uch was unju&s;t; that it came not under the notion of cruelty, but ju&s;tice, which was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to &s;upport the honours of the laws and the government. That the mercy &s;hewn by the Americans proceeded from a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of their error and guilt, or from an hy|pocritical policy to throw a reproach upon our army, by unprincipled acts of clemency.&mdash;This method of rea&s;oning proceeded upon taking for granted a point which is yet exceedingly doubtful; namely that the grounds of the war on the part of Britain were &s;uffi|ciently clear and ju&s;t; and that the principles of rebel|lion on the &s;ide of the coloni&s;ts were abundantly plain from our laws and con&s;titution.&mdash;The&s;e are points
<PB N="398" REF="406">which ought to have been &s;elf-evident before the war had been begun; and beyond all &s;u&s;picion before it had been carried on with &s;o much &s;everity and blood|&s;hed.</P>
<P>Whatever might be the opinions of the mini&s;try, the nation in general were of a different opinion; the people were &s;hocked at the reports of &s;uch unprovoked acts of barbarity, and &s;poke with great freedom concerning the authors of the war.&mdash; The common people in general, by following nature more clo&s;ely than tho&s;e in high life, judge with more impartiality concerning right and wrong; their minds are not warped by the prejudices of party, nor entan|gled in the toils of court &s;ophi&s;try and intrigue.&mdash; <HI>Vox populi&mdash;vox Dei,</HI> is a more univer&s;al rule than a great many people will allow it be; the people, un|le&s;s when very powerful means are u&s;ed to corrupt them, &s;eldom judge wrong concerning public affairs; and though by courtiers and mini&s;terial demagogues, they are accounted the &s;cum of the earth, yet they are rather the &s;alt thereof, from whence the &s;avour of truth flows, and is di&s;cerned among them when it is to be perceived no where el&s;e.</P>
<P>As the congre&s;s were inexorable with regard to all the &s;olicitations and remon&s;trances of General Bur|goyne and the Briti&s;h officers, and their mea&s;ures ap|peared now to be &s;ettled points with them. It was al|ledged, that their re&s;olution, which &s;u&s;pended the ra|tification of the convention of Saratoga, proceeded from the expectation of the ratification of a treaty be|tween them and France; and that they only made the non-ratification of the convention by Great Britain a pretence for their not fulfilling their part of the agree|ment. All this is exceedingly problematical. Tho'
<PB N="399" REF="407">the&s;e circum&s;tances might each of them have their par|ticular influence, yet they had warrantable groups to &s;u&s;pend the convention. It was nece&s;&s;ary that the quarters of the convention troops &s;hould be di&s;charg|ed by the government of Great Britain, which as yet had taken no &s;teps for that purpo&s;e, nor given any &s;ecurity for defraying the expences which the troops had incurred during their &s;tay at Bo&s;ton. There is no doubt but as they had rea&s;onable cau&s;es for &s;u&s;pend|ing the convention, that they had al&s;o other political rea&s;ons for making u&s;e of the&s;e cau&s;es. They were clo&s;ely pre&s;&s;ed by a part of the King's forces, at that time in actual po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable of their cities, for greatne&s;s, wealth, and commanding &s;ituation, they con&s;idered that &s;uffering tho&s;e conven|tion troops to be &s;ent to Europe from whence they might be ea&s;ily replaced, would turn the &s;cales of war again&s;t them, and therefore as they had &s;ufficient proofs of the troops having in &s;ome in&s;tances tran&s;gre&s;|&s;ed the convention, though they might have in other ca&s;es overlooked &s;uch a tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion: yet as their own &s;afety depended much upon the opportunity they now had of taking the advantage thereof, they reck|oned them&s;elves &s;ufficiently ju&s;tified in what they did. It is not in any degree doubtful that our mini&s;try, not|with&s;tanding all their complaints of infidelity on the part of the coloni&s;ts, would have taken the &s;ame ad|vantage of circum&s;tances of the &s;ame nature.</P>
<P>It does not however appear that the Americans were influenced by any certainty of the treaty with France, when they pa&s;&s;ed their re&s;olution &s;u&s;pending the ratification of the convention, for the re&s;olution was pa&s;&s;ed on the 8th of January, and the ratification of the treaty did not arrive in America till the 2d of
<PB N="400" REF="408">May. The coloni&s;ts were &s;ufficiently provoked to take &s;ome re&s;olute &s;teps, for their country was mo&s;t dreadfully harra&s;&s;ed, wa&s;ted, and burnt by our troops. The Briti&s;h forces, in&s;tead of carrying on a regular war, began now to act as free booters and plunder|ers. Colonel Abercromby made &s;ome predatory ex|cur&s;ions into the Jer&s;ies, and on the Delaware, where he killed &s;ome men, and carried off as much booty as he could find. By our accounts at home he &s;u&s;tained no lo&s;s in the&s;e excur&s;ions; but from &s;ome accounts which have been received from that quarter of the world, it is confidently affirmed that his lo&s;s was great|er than his advantages; and that though he did much mi&s;chief, that he paid well for it in lo&s;s of men, which then was &s;everely felt. The lo&s;s of the Americans on the&s;e occa&s;ions was exceedingly great, but this only tended to exa&s;perate them, and not to humble them; it rou&s;ed their &s;pirits, but did not depre&s;s them, and they exerted all their powers to make repri&s;als whenever they could find an opportunity. Their pri|vateers were in general pretty &s;ucce&s;sful in taking Briti&s;h ve&s;&s;els, and ventured even &s;o far as to make at|tacks upon our coa&s;ts. Cunningham and Jones, two captains of privateers, created much alarm upon the coa&s;ts of Ireland and Scotland, and the latter had well nigh &s;et fire to Whitehaven on the coa&s;t of Eng|land; he landed &s;ome of his men in the bay of Kirkud|bright, and plundered the hou&s;e of L. Selkirk, of all the plate that was in it. And it is &s;uppo&s;ed that had his Lord&s;hip been at home, that Jones intended to have carried him off a pri&s;oner. The enormity of this of|fence of Captain Jones was aggravated by the mini&s;try with the epithets of rebellion, villany, and inju&s;|tice; and his character de&s;cribed as one of the mo&s;t
<PB N="401" REF="409">abominable in the world. The Americans who em|ployed him were charged with all his pa&s;t iniquities, as well as with his pre&s;ent crimes, and they were now con&s;idered as the mo&s;t daring invaders that ever ex|i&s;ted upon this habitable globe. The people who brought this charge did not con&s;ider that the Ameri|cans had learned this method of attack and plunder|ing from the Briti&s;h government and troops, and were ready to return the accu&s;ations with double force up|on the Engli&s;h nation; which had without provoca|tion burnt their towns, murdered their inoffen&s;ive farmers, women and children, in the mo&s;t wanton and cruel manner. It was, truly, exceedingly ridiculous to hear the complaints and accu&s;ations that were brought at this time again&s;t the Congre&s;s and the A|mericans, for invading our coa&s;ts, when our troops were carrying &s;word and fire into their country as far as they dur&s;t go. The mo&s;t inveterate enemies of the Colonies could not &s;ay that the&s;e freebooters upon our coa&s;ts, had as yet committed any barbarities; but had behaved with an addre&s;s &s;uitable to the mo&s;t civilized characters in carrying on war. They had ra|vi&s;hed no women, murdered no old men or children, nor behaved rudely to any people beyond the com|mon rules of the faire&s;t war; and yet no Turks nor &s;avages could be repre&s;ented in a wor&s;e point of light. Paul Jones was repre&s;ented as the chief of traitors to his country, while as yet his identity was not fully a&s;|certained nor could any tell to what country he be|longed. This adventerous freebooter, whatever might be his country or character, was ju&s;t as hone&s;t a pirate as any other of the commanders of privateers upon the coa&s;t. In any nation to give authority to men to a&s;&s;ault hone&s;t traders upon the high &s;eas,
<PB N="402" REF="410">becau&s;e of the quarrels of princes, or &s;tates, is to give &s;anction to companies of robbers, and by the au|thority of government to give men liberty to commit the mo&s;t flagrant inju&s;tice.</P>
<P>It may appear, in &s;ome future period, exceedingly &s;trange that at the very time that Great Britain was appointing commi&s;&s;ioners to treat with the coloni&s;ts concerning a reconciliation, that even at that moment &s;he was committing the mo&s;t cruel and barbarous de|predations upon the coa&s;ts and in the country of the Americans. Towards the end of May &s;ome expedi|tions from Rhode I&s;land, were very de&s;tructive to the coloni&s;ts. The&s;e plundering parties &s;pared neither &s;hips, boats, &s;tores, hou&s;es, nor places of wor|&s;hip; all things &s;acred and profane, were di&s;po&s;ed of in the &s;ame manner, that is, were con&s;umed by fire. Private property, as well as public &s;tores, were de|&s;troyed, and every thing u&s;eful to man that the fire could con&s;ume was in many places reduced to a&s;hes. The officers who were employed in the&s;e expeditions who were generally as zealous as the &s;oldiers in acts of depredation, being a&s;hamed of what they had done, laid the blame of burning private hou&s;es upon the violence and rage of the men, and &s;aid they were contrary to their orders and intentions. This was con&s;idered as only an apology to cover in part tho&s;e enormities, which they could not vindicate either to the world or their own con&s;ciences.</P>
<P>The Americans made many charges of cruel|ty, &s;ome of which were but too well founded again&s;t the troops of Britain on the&s;e occa&s;ions. Particularly the refu&s;ing of quarter, and of &s;laughtering men in cold blood, &s;everal of whom neither had arms in their hands nor were in any military capacity. On the
<PB N="403" REF="411">&s;ide of Rhode I&s;land the charges were of the mo&s;t po&s;i|tive nature; and they complained of the troops for car|rying off the mo&s;t peaceable inhabitants of the coun|try, and detaining them as pri&s;oners of war, until they &s;hould in &s;ome future time be exchanged for an equal number of &s;oldiers taken on their &s;ide. It was replied in defence of our officers and men, that as all men in that country were obliged by their laws to car|ry arms from &s;ixteen to &s;ixty, they were therefore to be con&s;idered, and treated as &s;oldiers at all times, whether they were found in actual &s;ervice or not.&mdash; This was very feeble and weak rea&s;oning; for the &s;ame thing may be &s;aid of Engli&s;hmen at home. They are bound by the laws to &s;erve in the militia from a certain age to another period of their lives, and in any &s;imilar ca&s;e ought to be made pri&s;oners of war.</P>
<P>The&s;e were methods not very likely to produce a reconciliation, though this practice was con&s;idered by many at home as the mo&s;t certain and probable me|thod of effecting it. Like all the other &s;chemes of our mini&s;try the&s;e barbarous methods produced a quite contrary effect to what they were intended. They rou&s;ed the minds of the coloni&s;ts and heated their re|&s;entment to &s;uch a degree, that they were more ready to &s;eek to be revenged, than to be reconciled to men who were continuing to do them &s;uch e&s;&s;ential inju|ries. It was impo&s;&s;ible for the Americans to believe that the&s;e per&s;ons ever intended to be reconciled, who were continuing to &s;pill their be&s;t blood, and lay all their country wa&s;te by fire and &s;word wherever they could find an opportunity. The&s;e were &s;uch &s;igna|tures of reconciliation, as are not u&s;ually practi&s;ed by tho&s;e who have &s;incere friend&s;hip in their hearts.&mdash; From the&s;e circum&s;tances it was ea&s;ily fore&s;een, that
<PB N="404" REF="412">Great Britain was neither &s;incere in her intentions, nor indeed de&s;ired reconciliation upon any other prin|ciple than unconditional &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion. And nothing but the &s;tronge&s;t legi&s;lative a&s;&s;urance that &s;he would &s;tand to an agreement, could have warranted the coloni&s;ts to treat with her commi&s;&s;ioners. Suppo&s;e the Ame|ricans had even been di&s;po&s;ed to have accepted the terms propo&s;ed in the commi&s;&s;ion, yet they could not have tru&s;ted the &s;ecurity that was given for the performance of the articles. The men that offered the&s;e terms were the very men that were wa&s;ting their country, and &s;hedding their blood, who could not be tru&s;ted in any thing, as they had not the confidence of their own nation, and could not po&s;&s;ibly have the confidence of the people they were &s;laughtering and de&s;troying. It was therefore nece&s;&s;ary, that a deed of the whole legi&s;lature &s;hould be given before com|mi&s;&s;ioners had been &s;ent to treat concerning reconci|liation.</P>
<P>There was &s;till an apprehen&s;ion that ruled in the minds of the Briti&s;h mini&s;try, and which uniformly led them into many blunders, namely, that the coloni&s;ts were greatly divided among them&s;elves. Under the influence of this apprehen&s;ion, they imagined that the plan of reconciliation which they had formed and with which they them&s;elves were &s;carcely &s;atisfied, would be &s;o alluring to the coloni&s;ts that they would throw off the authority of the Congre&s;s, and accept of the terms of reconciliation. Before the conciliatory bills were fully reduced into form and &s;hape, a rough draught of them was &s;ent off to America to Governor Tryon, at New York, for him to circulate among the people of the revolted colonies at large. This pro|duced a wor&s;e effect than had been fore&s;een, by our
<PB N="405" REF="413">court politicians. It greatly a&s;toni&s;hed and provoked their own army at New-York and other parts in Ame|rica; their indignation was rai&s;ed at the affront thereby put upon them, and nothing could exceed the degra|dation which they felt from the conce&s;&s;ions in this bill. They had been made to believe that they would be &s;upported with &s;ufficient aid to carry on the war with vigour, and to fini&s;h it &s;oon. The nature and cir|cum&s;tances of the war, and the long cour&s;e of inju|ries and lo&s;&s;es which had been offered and received, had by this time rendered every individual a party in the conte&s;t. The &s;oldiers had been taught to think that nothing le&s;s than ab&s;olute conque&s;t on their &s;ide, and unconditional &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion on the other could bring the war to a conclu&s;ion. They blu&s;hed at the re|collection, and thought their per&s;onal honour wound|ed in the recantation which was now made of all that haughty language and treatment, which they had been accu&s;tomed to hold out, or offer to rebels. Mi|litary men in general do not examine deeply into the merits of a cau&s;e, where pre&s;ent hope of advantage, or martial honours are to be acquired. Ju&s;tice and equity are but &s;eldom annexed to the ideas of offen|&s;ive war. When once ho&s;tilities are begun, in the ideas of &s;oldiers, re&s;i&s;tance in defending the mo&s;t &s;a|cred right is con&s;idered an injury. And whoever fights again&s;t them is con&s;idered as their enemies, though they them&s;elves are the unju&s;t invaders, and alone come under the notion of enemies. The offi|cers and &s;oldiers at this time felt the di&s;appointment more &s;everely, as they had been made to expect a reinforcement of 20,000 men, and in&s;tead of this a&s;&s;i&s;tance had only received an incon&s;i&s;tent and ab|&s;urd paper &s;ub&s;titute. It is not ea&s;y to de&s;cribe the
<PB N="406" REF="414">&s;urprize and amazement of the officers in the army; they vented their indignation again&s;t the mini&s;try in louder exclamations than ever they had done again&s;t the Americans, and did not only cur&s;e the managers in their hearts, but bur&s;t out into violent execrations of the loude&s;t nature. The numerous body of Ameri|can refugees found them&s;elves in a wor&s;e &s;ituation; their feelings were more pungent and exqui&s;ite than even tho&s;e of the army. They had fled to the army in expectation of &s;oon having the leading rule and the chief po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions in America in their power, to|gether with the hopes of gratifying their revenge upon tho&s;e whom they thought had u&s;ed them ill. They found not in the bills any &s;ecurity to them for the things they expected, and they knew what they de&s;erved at the hands of their countrymen. A more di&s;mal &s;ituation cannot be conceived, than their ap|prehen&s;ion, &s;ugge&s;ted to them.</P>
<P>The method of publication of the&s;e bills produced as bad an effect as the &s;ending of them. They had been &s;ent through the country by Tryon in the be&s;t manner he could, which was con&s;idered by the Con|gre&s;s as an in&s;idious method to divide the people and to corrupt them. They therefore &s;hewed &s;uch a contempt of this method of proceeding that they or|dered the bills immediately to be publi&s;hed in their Gazettes and &s;hewn to all America, with very profit|able notes and commentaries. The addre&s;s of the Congre&s;s and General Wa&s;hington on this occa&s;ion, might have taught our mini&s;try and commi&s;&s;ioners the characters of the men they had now to deal with.&mdash; General Wa&s;hington, in an&s;wer to a letter from Go|vernor Tryon, in which he de&s;ired him to circulate &s;everal copies of the draughts of the bills &s;ent him
<PB N="407" REF="415">among the men and officers of his army inclo&s;ed in his letter to him a printed news paper in which they had been in&s;erted by order of the Congre&s;s, accompanied by the re&s;olutions of that a&s;&s;embly upon the &s;ubject. This &s;hews in what &s;overeign contempt the&s;e papers and their authors were held in by the Congre&s;s, and how little they feared their influence among the peo|ple. Governor Turnbull, in an&s;wer to a &s;imilar letter &s;ent to him, ob&s;erved that propo&s;itions of peace were u&s;ually made from the &s;upreme authority of one con|tending power to the like or &s;imilar authority of the other: And that the pre&s;ent was the fir&s;t in&s;tance within his recollection in which they had been ad|dre&s;&s;ed to the people at large of the oppo&s;ite power, as an overture of reconciliation. He proceeded,&mdash; "There was a day when even this &s;tep from our then acknowledged parent &s;tate, might have been accepted with joy and gratitude, but that is lo&s;t, and pa&s;t irre|vocably. The repeated rejection of our &s;incere and humble petitions, at the commencement of ho&s;tilities; the inhumanity which has marked the pro&s;ecution of the war on your part in its &s;everal &s;tages; the in&s;o|lence which di&s;plays it&s;elf on every petty advantage; the cruelties which have been exerci&s;ed on tho&s;e un|happy men, whom the fortune of war has thrown into your hands; all the&s;e are in&s;uperable bars to the idea of concluding a peace with Great Britain, upon any other conditions, than the mo&s;t ab&s;olute and per|fect independence. He concluded his letter with the following ob&s;ervations upon the re&s;toration of union by a la&s;ting and honourable peace, which he declared to be the ardent wi&s;h of every hone&s;t American, namely, 'The Briti&s;h nation may then find us as affection|ate and valuable friends as we are now determined
<PB N="408" REF="416">and fatal enemies, and will derive from that friend|&s;hip more &s;olid and real advantages, than the mo&s;t &s;anguine can expect from conque&s;t.'</P>
<P>It mu&s;t have greatly mortified the pride of Gover|nor Tryon to find that his papers were treated with &s;o much contempt by the Congre&s;s, and &s;till more on the account that they produced no effect upon the people. The&s;e were the two ends of this publication of the rough draughts of the&s;e bills: fir&s;t to intimi|date and frighten the Congre&s;s, and &s;econdly to divide the people. Neither of the&s;e de&s;igns happen|ed to take any effect. What the mini&s;try at home imagined would create divi&s;ions among the coloni&s;ts, united them more clo&s;ely together; for they &s;aw that Britain fir&s;t wanted to make them behave like knaves, and then to treat them like fools, to make them break their agreement with an ally that had a&s;&s;i&s;ted them in their di&s;tre&s;s, and throw them&s;elves into the hands of tyrants and per&s;ecutors, who had &s;laughtered their people, and wa&s;ted their country. During the time the&s;e tran&s;actions were carrying on, neither the Congre&s;s nor General Wa&s;hington were remi&s;s in making vigorous preparations for another cam|paign; whil&s;t both in their public acts &s;et forth to the people the hopes of it being the la&s;t, and of their driving the Briti&s;h forces out of America. General Wa&s;hington had now fully proved their patience and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion in their long winter encampment; he therefore &s;truck off all the unnece&s;&s;ary baggage of both men and officers to the clo&s;e&s;t bounds of nece&s;|&s;ity, and made every other reformation which make them nimble in &s;ervice and effective in action. He al&s;o wrote a public letter to the farmers in the mid|dle colonies, reque&s;ting them to fatten cattle for the
<PB N="409" REF="417">army, for the en&s;uing campaign. By this experi|ment he found how his name and character operated in their e&s;teem.&mdash;The Congre&s;s, among other things which &s;hewed their attention to the war, i&s;|&s;ued a re&s;olution &s;trongly urging the young gentle|men of the different colonies, to rai&s;e a body of light cavalry at their own expence, during the campaign; promi&s;ing them &s;uch allurements, as were calculated to reconcile that order of men to the re&s;traints and duties of a military life, in the &s;imple rank and cha|racter of private volunteers.</P>
<P>The perfect knowledge of the ratification of the treaty between France and America, had not yet ar|rived on the we&s;tern continent, though it was general|ly believed it had taken effect. The agents for our government were on that account more bu&s;y to ren|der it ineffectual by u&s;ing all means directly or indi|rectly that were in their power. Nor were the Con|gre&s;s wanting on their part in u&s;ing the mo&s;t probable and rational means to bafflle all the attempts of their enemies, and to render the Briti&s;h commi&s;&s;ion of no effect. After &s;everal deliberations and re&s;olutions, a declaration was publi&s;hed by the Congre&s;s, That any man or body of men, who &s;hould pre&s;ume to make any convention or partial agreement with com|mi&s;&s;ioners under the crown of Great Britain, &s;hould be con&s;idered and treated as enemies to the United States. That the United States could not with pro|priety, hold any conference or treaty with any com|mi&s;&s;ioners on the part of Great Britain, unle&s;s they &s;hould as a preliminary thereto, either withdraw their fleets and armies, or el&s;e in po&s;itive and expre&s;s terms acknowledge the independence of the &s;tates. And in as much as it appeared to be the
<PB N="410" REF="418">de&s;ign of their enemies, to lull them into a fatal &s;ecu|rity, they called upon the &s;everal &s;tates to u&s;e the mo&s;t &s;trenuous exertions, to have their re&s;pective quo|tas of troops in the field as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible; and that all their militia might be held in readine&s;s to act as occa&s;ion &s;hould require. All their re&s;olutions upon this &s;ubject were unanimou&s;ly agreed to, notwith&s;tand|ing that we were a&s;&s;ured at home, that the Congre&s;s was divided and that there were &s;carcely two of them of one opinion. The&s;e means of deception were very fatal to our mini&s;try, for they totally ruined their credit with the nation; for their mo&s;t &s;incere friends who echoed all they &s;aid, did not even believe them, and often when they really told the truth they were not believed, till people were convinced by other means of the certainty thereof.</P>
<P>The fatal day at la&s;t approached which fini&s;hed the &s;eparation between Britain and America; Silas Deane arrived expre&s;s from Paris at York-Town, where the Congre&s;s had a&s;&s;embled &s;ince the lo&s;s of Philadelphia, with tho&s;e in&s;truments that &s;tampt a &s;eal upon that &s;eparation. He had &s;ailed from France in a royal frigate of 28 guns, appointed for the purpo&s;e, and brought with him copies of the two treaties of alli|ance and commerce, for the ratification of the Con|gre&s;s, which had been concluded between France and the United States. The la&s;t of the&s;e was the fir&s;t that had been executed, being &s;igned on the 30th of January; the treaty of alliance was dated the 6th of February. Mr Deane al&s;o brought an account of many other matters that were highly plea&s;ing as well as what related to the negociation, and its ratification.</P>
<P>The joy of the Americans was by this tran&s;action rai&s;ed to an high pitch, and could only be equalled
<PB N="411" REF="419">by their public demon&s;trations thereof. The Con|gre&s;s immediately publi&s;hed a Gazette, which, be&s;ide a &s;ummary account of the general information they had received, exhibited &s;ome of the mo&s;t flattering articles of the treaties, with their own ob&s;ervations upon them to the people; the equity, genero&s;ity, and honour of the French King were extolled in an high degree. In this paper they &s;eemed to count upon Spain as being already a party virtually in the alli|ance; and to con&s;ider the naval force of both united in their cau&s;e. They al&s;o &s;eemed to depend much upon the the friend&s;hip of other powers, and exulted in the favourable di&s;po&s;ition of Europe in general to America. It was a &s;cheme of the greate&s;t folly for the court of Great Britain to pretend to bring about a reconciliation between this nation and America, according to Lord North's conciliatory bills; the coloni&s;ts were now independent &s;tates, and had pro|cured an alliance that was likely to &s;upport that in|dependency; without fir&s;t acknowledging that inde|pendency there was not the &s;malle&s;t probability that ever a treaty would commence. The &s;ending of com|mi&s;&s;ioners after they knew of this treaty between France and the colonies, was a &s;cheme fraught with folly, weakne&s;s, and ab&s;urdity.</P>
<P>About &s;ix days after Mr Deane arrived at York-Town, General Sir Henry Clinton arrived to take the command of the army at Philadelphia, in the room of Sir William Howe. This was alarming and grievous to the officers and &s;oldiers, who exceedingly regard|ed General Howe, and was held in great e&s;teem by them all. In the beginning of June the commi&s;&s;ioners from England arrived in the Delaware. The Earl of Carli&s;le, Mr Eden, and Governor John&s;tone, were
<PB N="412" REF="420">joined mutually in this commi&s;&s;ion. The&s;e commi&s;|&s;ioners appear to have had more confidence in the &s;uc|ce&s;s of their commi&s;&s;ion, than the nature and contents of it, or the &s;ea&s;on in which it came, promi&s;ed them. Upon the 9th of June, immediately after their arrival, they di&s;patched a letter with the acts of parliament and a copy of their commi&s;&s;ion, and other papers to the pre&s;ident of the Congre&s;s; but their &s;ecretary Dr Fergu&s;on who was intended to carry the papers, and to act as an agent for conducting the negociation upon the &s;pot with the Congre&s;s, being refu&s;ed a pa&s;|port for that purpo&s;e, they were obliged to forward them by the common means of conveyance. Never were commi&s;&s;ioners from any court, &s;o much di&s;liked and held in &s;uch contempt, as our commi&s;&s;ioners were by the American Congre&s;s. When the letters and commi&s;&s;ion came to hand, it was long debated whe|ther they &s;hould be read, and it was with difficulty they were admitted to be taken the &s;malle&s;t notice of.</P>
<P>The commi&s;&s;ioners propo&s;ed at their fir&s;t beginning of this bu&s;ine&s;s, &s;everal conce&s;&s;ions and arrangements, which in a more early period would have re&s;tored peace and felicity to the whole empire. They offered to con&s;ent to the immediate ce&s;&s;ation of ho&s;tilities by &s;ea and land&mdash;to re&s;tore a free intercour&s;e and to re|new the common benefits of civilization, through the &s;everal parts of the empire. To extend every free|dom to trade, that the re&s;pective intere&s;ts on both &s;ides could require.&mdash;To agree that no military force &s;hould be kept up in the different &s;tates in North A|merica, without the con&s;ent of the general Congre&s;s, or of the particular a&s;&s;emblies.&mdash;To concur to mea|&s;ures calculated to di&s;charge the debts of America,
<PB N="413" REF="421">and to rai&s;e the credit and value of paper circulation. To perpetuate the common union, by a reciprocal de|putation of an agent or agents from the different &s;tates, who &s;hould have the privilege of a &s;eat and voice in the parliament of Great Britain; or if &s;ent from Britain in that ca&s;e, to have a &s;eat and a voice in the a&s;&s;emblies of the different &s;tates to which they might be deputed re&s;pectively, in order to attend to the &s;e|veral intere&s;ts of tho&s;e by whom they were deputed. And in &s;hort to e&s;tabli&s;h the power of the re&s;pective legi&s;latures in each particular &s;tate, to &s;ettle its re|venue, its civil and military e&s;tabli&s;hment, and to exerci&s;e a perfect freedom of legi&s;lation, and internal government; &s;o that the Briti&s;h &s;tates throughout North America, acting with Great Britain in peace and war, under one common &s;overeign, might have the irrevocable enjoyment of every privilege, that was &s;hort of a total &s;eparation of intere&s;t, or con&s;i&s;tent with that union of force on which the &s;afety of the common religion and liberty depends. The&s;e were humbling conce&s;&s;ions, and &s;hewed the meanne&s;s of the mini&s;try, who in the hour of their di&s;tre&s;s, were rea|dy to grant much more than would have been accept|ed with thankfulne&s;s when their pride would not &s;uf|fer them to li&s;ten to any rea&s;onable accommodation. They de&s;pi&s;ed the mo&s;t humble and rea&s;onable pe|titions, which did not require the half of what now they were ready to propo&s;e them&s;elves, when they might have known that their propo&s;als could not be accepted. There are none &s;o mean &s;pirited in the time of adver&s;ity, as the&s;e that are haughty in the time of &s;ucce&s;s and pro&s;perity. The mini&s;ter was now lying pro&s;trate at the feet of the&s;e coloni&s;ts, to whom he had declared he would not li&s;ten, till he had them at
<PB N="414" REF="422">his feet. The hi&s;tory of this tran&s;action may be a warning to future mini&s;ters, and crowned heads may learn from hence, that to govern with mildne&s;s and in mercy is the &s;ure&s;t method to extend government, or keep the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of what they enjoy. Mankind are not born with chains about their necks, nor with &s;addles on their backs, to be bound when princes plea&s;e, or to be ridden upon when they have a mind.</P>
<P>The&s;e papers produced &s;everal long debates in the Congre&s;s, which were renewed upon different days, from the eleventh till the &s;eventeenth of June, but their an&s;wer which they returned by Henry Laurens, was &s;ufficiently brief, &s;ignificant, and conclu&s;ive.&mdash; They ob&s;erved to the commi&s;&s;ioners, that the acts of the Briti&s;h parliament, the commi&s;&s;ion from their &s;overeign, and their letter &s;uppo&s;ed the people of tho&s;e &s;tates to be &s;ubjects to the crown of Great Bri|tain, and were founded upon the idea of dependence, which was totally inadmi&s;&s;ible. They informed them that they were inclined to peace, notwith&s;tanding the unju&s;t claims from which the war originated, and the &s;avage manner in which it had been conducted. They would therefore be ready to enter upon the con&s;i|deration of a treaty of peace and commerce, not in|con&s;i&s;tent with treaties already &s;ub&s;i&s;ting, when the King of Great Britain &s;hould demon&s;trate a &s;incere di&s;po&s;ition for that purpo&s;e. But the only &s;olid proof of that di&s;po&s;ition would be, an explicit acknowledge|ment of the independence of tho&s;e &s;tates, or the with|drawing of his fleets and armies.</P>
<P>Thus, an opportunity was lo&s;t which cannot be cal|led back to Great Britain, by procra&s;tinating the means till the &s;ea&s;on was over. Such were the con|ditions which an unhappy concurrence of events in|duced
<PB N="415" REF="423">on the one &s;ide, and what the operation of the &s;ame ca&s;es rendered inadmi&s;&s;ible on the other. The Congre&s;s, at the &s;ame time, i&s;&s;ued an unanimous ap|probation of the conduct of General Wa&s;hington, in refu&s;ing a pa&s;&s;port to Dr Fergu&s;on. This was a mor|tifying &s;troke to the pride of the Profe&s;&s;or of Moral Philo&s;ophy, who had left the charge of his pupils to another, for the office of &s;ecretary to the commi&s;&s;ion|ers, with an intention, as was &s;uppo&s;ed, to rai&s;e money in a &s;horter way, than by teaching dry morals in an univer&s;ity. His hi&s;tory of Cival he imagined would introduce him to the Congre&s;s; and Governor John|&s;tone made a &s;ort of merit of his reputation in the re|public of letters.&mdash;But however famous he might be in the republic of letters, his commi&s;&s;ion rendered him unfit for the republics in America.</P>
<P>When the Briti&s;h commi&s;&s;ioners found that they could obtain no acce&s;s to the Congre&s;s, they employ|ed them&s;elves in addre&s;&s;ing the people at large, which the Congre&s;s were &s;o far from interrupting, that they gave free &s;cope to the controver&s;y without engaging in it them&s;elves. The commi&s;&s;ioners &s;eem to have carried along with them an idea, which at the time of their appointment, was endeavoured with great care to be e&s;tabli&s;hed in England, and which had from the beginning mi&s;led the mini&s;try in all their mea&s;ures, namely, "that the bulk of the Americans were well affected to the Briti&s;h government, and that the great|e&s;t part of the remainder were only held in a &s;tate of delu&s;ion by the Congre&s;s," they accordingly, when the negociation failed, directed their publications in appeals to the people at large; &s;eemingly thereby to realize in &s;ome degree the charges &s;o repeatedly made on the other &s;ide, that their only object was
<PB N="416" REF="424">under the in&s;idious appearance of conciliation, to ex|cite either a &s;eparation among&s;t the colonies, or the people to tumults again&s;t their re&s;pective govern|ments. For this purpo&s;e they publi&s;hed the follow|ing manife&s;to and proclamation.&mdash;"Having amply and repeatedly made known to the Congre&s;s, and having al&s;o proclaimed to the inhabitants of North America in general, the benevolent overtures of Great Britain towards a re-union and coalition with her colonies, we do not think it con&s;i&s;tent either with the duty we owe to our country, or with a ju&s;t regard to the characters we bear, to per&s;i&s;t in holding out offers which in our e&s;timation required only to be known to be gratefully accepted; and we have ac|cordingly, except only the commander in chief, who will be detained by military duties, re&s;olved to return to England a few weeks after the date of this mani|fe&s;to and declaration. Previous however, to this de|ci&s;ive &s;tep, we are led by a ju&s;t anxiety for the great objects of our mi&s;&s;ion, to enlarge on &s;ome complaints which may not have been &s;ufficiently under&s;tood, to recapitulate to our fellow &s;ubjects the ble&s;&s;ings which we are empowered to confer, and to warn them of the continued evils to which they are at pre&s;ent blind|ly and ob&s;tinately expo&s;ing them&s;elves.</P>
<P>To the members of the Congre&s;s we again declare, that we are ready to concur in all &s;atisfactory and ju&s;t arrangements for &s;ecuring to them and their re&s;pec|tive con&s;tituents, the re-e&s;tabli&s;hment of peace, with the exemption from any impo&s;ition of taxes by Great Britain, and the irrevocable enjoyment of every pri|vilege con&s;i&s;tent with that union and force on which our mutual pro&s;perity, and the &s;afety of our common religion and liberties depend. We again a&s;&s;$rt that
<PB N="417" REF="425">the members of the Congre&s;s were not authorized by their con&s;tituents, either to reject our offers without the previous con&s;ideration and con&s;ent of the &s;everal a&s;&s;emblies and conventions, their con&s;tituents, or to refer us to pretended foreign treaties, which they knew were delu&s;ively framed in the fir&s;t in&s;tance, and which have never yet been ratified by the people of this continent. And we once more remind the members of the Congre&s;s, that they are re&s;pon&s;ible to their countrymen, to the world, and to God, for the con|tinuance of this war, and for all the mi&s;eries with which it mu&s;t be attended.</P>
<P>To the general a&s;&s;emblies and conventions of the dif|ferent colonies, plantations, and provinces abovemen|tioned, we now &s;eparately make the offers which we originally tran&s;mitted to the Congre&s;s; and we here|by call upon and urge them to meet expre&s;&s;ively for the purpo&s;e of con&s;idering whether every motive, po|litical as well as moral, &s;hould not decide their re&s;o|lution to embrace the occa&s;ion of cementing a free and firm coalition with Great Britain. It has not been, nor is it our wi&s;h, to &s;eek the objects which we are commi&s;&s;ioned to pur&s;ue, by fomenting popular divi&s;ions and partial cabals; we think &s;uch conduct would be ill &s;uited to the generous nature of the of|fers made, and unbecoming the dignity of the king and the &s;tate which make them. But it is both our wi&s;h and our duty to encourage and &s;upport any men or bodies of men, in their return of loyalty to our &s;overeign and affection to our fellow &s;ubjects. To all others, free inhabitants of this once happy empire, we al&s;o addre&s;s our&s;elves. Such of them as are actually in arms, of what&s;oever rank or de&s;cription, will do well to recol|lect, that the grievances, whether real or &s;uppo&s;ed,

<P>To tho&s;e who&s;e profe&s;&s;ions it is to exerci&s;e the func|tions of religion on this continent; it cannot &s;urely be un|known that the &s;overeign power with which the Con|gre&s;s is endeavouring to connect them&s;elves, has ever been aver&s;e to toleration, and inveterately oppo&s;ed to the intere&s;t and freedom of the place of wor&s;hip which they &s;erve; and that Great Britain, from whom they are for the pre&s;ent &s;eparated, mu&s;t both from the principles of their con&s;titution, and of prote&s;tanti&s;m, be at all times the be&s;t guardian of religious liberty, and mo&s;t di&s;po&s;ed to promote and extend it.&mdash;To all tho&s;e who can e&s;timate the ble&s;&s;ings of peace and its influence over agriculture, arts, and commerce, who can feel a due anxiety for the education and e&s;tabli&s;h|ment of their children, or who can place a ju&s;t value on dome&s;tic &s;ecurity, we think it &s;ufficient to ob&s;erve, that they are made by their leaders to continue in|volved in all the calamities of war, without having either a ju&s;t object to pur&s;ue, or a &s;ub&s;i&s;ting grievance which may not in&s;tantly be redre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>But if there be any per&s;on who, dive&s;ted of mi&s;|taken re&s;entment, and uninfluenced by &s;elfi&s;h intere&s;t, really think that it is for the benefit of the colonies to &s;eparate them&s;elves from Great Britain, and that &s;o &s;eparated they will find a con&s;titution more mild, more free, and better calculated for their pro&s;perity than
<PB N="419" REF="427">that which we are impowered and di&s;po&s;ed to renew and improve; with &s;uch per&s;ons we will not di&s;pute a po&s;ition which &s;eems to be &s;ufficiently con|tradicted, by the experience they have had. But think it right to leave them fully aware of the change, which the maintaining of &s;uch a po&s;ition mu&s;t make in the nature and future conduct of this war, more e&s;pecially when to this po&s;ition is added, the pretend|ed alliance with the court of France. The policy, as well as the benevolence of Great Britain, have thus far checked the extremes of war when they tended to di&s;tre&s;s a people &s;till con&s;idered as our fellow &s;ub|jects; and to de&s;olate a country &s;hortly to become again a &s;ource of mutual advantage; but when that country profe&s;&s;es the unnatural de&s;ign, not only of e&s;tranging her|&s;elf from us, but of mortgaging her&s;elf and her re&s;ources to our enemies, the whole conte&s;t is changed; and the que&s;tion is, how far Great Britain may, by every means in her power, de&s;troy or render u&s;ele&s;s a con|nection contrived for her ruin and the aggrandize|ment of France. Under &s;uch circum&s;tances, the laws of &s;elf pre&s;ervation mu&s;t direct the conduct of Great Britain; and if the colonies are to become an acce&s;|&s;ion to France, will direct her to render that acce&s;&s;ion of as little avail as po&s;&s;ible to her enemies.</P>
<P>If there are any who notwith&s;tanding the&s;e rea&s;on|ings, the independence of the&s;e colonies will, in the re|&s;ult, be acknowledged by Great Britain; to them we an|&s;wer without re&s;erve, that we neither po&s;&s;e&s;s nor ex|pect powers for that purpo&s;e; and that if Great Bri|tain could ever &s;ink &s;o low, as to adopt &s;uch a mea|&s;ure, we &s;hould not have thought our&s;elves compel|lable to be the in&s;truments in making a conce&s;&s;ion which in our opinion would be calamitous to the colonies for
<PB N="420" REF="428">whom it was made, and di&s;graceful as well as calami|tous to the country from whom it is required. And we think proper to declare, that in this &s;pirit and &s;en|timent we have regularly written from the continent to Great Britain.</P>
<P>It will now become the colonies, regularly to call to mind their own &s;olemn appeals to heaven in the beginning of the conte&s;t, that they took arms only for the redre&s;s of grievances, and that it would be their wi&s;h, as well as their intere&s;t to remain forever connected with Great Britain. We again a&s;k them whether all their grievances real or &s;uppo&s;ed, have not been amply and fully redre&s;&s;ed;&mdash;and we in&s;i&s;t that the offers we have made leave nothing to be wi&s;hed in point either of immediate or permanent &s;e|curity; if tho&s;e offers are now rejected, we withdraw from the exerci&s;e of a commi&s;&s;ion with which we have in vain been honoured; the &s;ame liberality will no longer be due from Great Britain, nor can it either in ju&s;tice or policy be expected from her.</P>
<P>In fine, and for the further manife&s;tation, as well of the di&s;po&s;ition we bear, as of the gracious and ge|nerous purpo&s;es of the commi&s;&s;ion under which we act, made and pa&s;&s;ed the la&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion of parliament, intituled, an act to enable his maje&s;ty to appoint com|mi&s;&s;ioners with &s;ufficient powers to treat, conduct, and agree upon the means of quieting the di&s;orders now &s;ub&s;i&s;ting in certain colonies, plantations, and pro|vinces, in North America, having been plea&s;ed to au|thorize and empower us to grant a pardon or pardons, to any number or de&s;cription of per&s;ons, within the colonies plantations and provinces of New Hamp&s;hire, Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ett's Bay, Rhode I&s;land, Connecticut, New-York, New-Jer&s;ey, Penn&s;ylvania, the three lower

<PB N="424" REF="432">matters herein contained." Given at New-York, this third day of October, 1778.</P>
<P>This manife&s;to was &s;igned by the commi&s;&s;ioners and publi&s;hed as far as po&s;&s;ible among the coloni&s;ts. Mr Drayton, one of the delegates for South Carolina, made a large and &s;evere an&s;wer to it, where all the ar|guments of the Commi&s;&s;ioners were treated in a very ma&s;terly and animated manner, which plainly &s;hewed, that whatever excellencies the Briti&s;h Commi&s;&s;ioners might have in other re&s;pects, they were inferior in the exerci&s;e and management of argument and literary compo&s;ition, to this &s;ingle combatant who had now engaged them. The technical law terms, and formal phra&s;es of this manife&s;to, were matter of mere laugh|ter to the American <HI>literati;</HI> and in &s;hort the proclama|tion was handled in &s;uch a manner, that the whole in|tended effect thereof was rendered quite abortive.&mdash; The ju&s;tice of its fir&s;t principles were ab&s;olutely de|nied, and the &s;upremacy of the mother country over the colonies &s;ince the act of independency, con&s;idered as ridiculous and ab&s;urd. Pardons and remi&s;&s;ions &s;o fully offered to tho&s;e that were con&s;idered in a &s;tate of rebellion, were treated with contempt, as &s;up|po&s;ing what the coloni&s;ts did not admit, that free &s;tates could be in a &s;tate of rebellion with re&s;pect to any other power. The clemency and mercy of the &s;o|vereign, was viewed in a very different light by the Americans, from what it was repre&s;ented by the com|mi&s;&s;ioners, and they con&s;idered all the pre&s;ent offers thereof as &s;tratagems of policy to lead them into a &s;nare. What the commi&s;&s;ioners ob&s;erved with regard to their &s;olemn appeals to Heaven, in the beginning of the conte&s;t, "that they took arms for the redre&s;s of grievances only, and that it was then their wi&s;h as
<PB N="425" REF="433">well as their intere&s;t to remain forever connected with Great Britain; they accounted it the greate&s;t &s;ophi&s;|try when u&s;ed in an argument at this time. Great Bri|tain had rejected all their former petitions, and treat|ed all their earne&s;t reque&s;ts with &s;corn; and it was now out of her power to redre&s;s the new and fre&s;h grievances that they had rea&s;on to complain of &s;ince the&s;e petitions had been pre&s;ented. The Commi&s;|&s;ioners could not rai&s;e from the dead, their beloved friends and dear relations, whom their haughty nation had &s;lain in a cruel and unrea&s;onable war; nor was it in the power of Britain, through a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of ages, to make reparation for the injury &s;he had done them.</P>
<P>She had driven them by her violence and cruelty, to declare them&s;elves independent, and to enter into a treaty with foreign powers for their a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and wanted now to redre&s;s their grievances, at the ex|pence of the blood of their friends, the ruin of their country, and their public faith. Had Britain offered &s;ooner, the half of what &s;he now propo&s;ed, it would have been accepted thankfully, and gratefully re|ceived; but the time was now pa&s;t for redre&s;&s;ing of grievances, in the manner propo&s;ed by the Commi&s;|&s;ioners.</P>
<P>The Americans told the publi&s;hers of the manife&s;to, that they had already concluded a &s;olemn treaty with France, on the footing of, and for e&s;tabli&s;hing of their independency. That if they now treated with the Commi&s;&s;ioners upon the ground of dependence, they &s;hould at once break their treaty with France, for|feit their credit with all foreign nations, be con&s;i|dered as a faithle&s;s and infamous people, and for ever|more be cut off from the hope of foreign &s;uccour or re&s;our&s;e. At the &s;ame time they would be thrown
<PB N="426" REF="434">totally on the mercy of tho&s;e, who had already pur|&s;ued every mea&s;ure of fraud, force, cruelty, and de|ceit for their de&s;truction; as neither the King, the mi|ni&s;ters, nor the parliament of England, would be un|der the nece&s;&s;ity of ratifying any one condition, which they agreed upon with the Commi&s;&s;ioners. Or if they ever found it nece&s;&s;ary to ratify them for the pre&s;ent purpo&s;e, it would be to call a new parliament, to undo the whole. Nothing, they &s;aid, could be tru&s;ted to an enemy whom they had already found &s;o faithle&s;s, and &s;o ob&s;tinately per&s;evering in malice and cruelty. The fraudulent intention of the propo&s;ed negociations, they &s;aid, was &s;trongly evinced by the Commi&s;&s;ioners, who went far beyond their avowed powers; being neither warranted by the commi&s;&s;ion, nor by the acts of parliament which they pre&s;ented. The&s;e arguments had more effect upon the minds of the people, than all the pompous promi&s;es and threat|nings in the manife&s;to and proclamation. The whole proceedings of the Commi&s;&s;ioners were con&s;idered as political craft to en&s;nare, intangle, and &s;educe the peo|ple; that having once put them off their guard, they might be more ea&s;ily &s;ubdued, and brought to accept the terms which were propo&s;ed to them.</P>
<P>There were &s;everal concurrent circum&s;tances which tended to fru&s;trate this negociation. It was too long in being propo&s;ed, for if our mini&s;try actually intend|ed a reconciliation, they ought to have made their of|fers thereof before the French treaty was concluded: for it was quite irrational to &s;uppo&s;e, that a people who were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the &s;malle&s;t degree of honour or principle, would immediately break a &s;olemn treaty, and the fir&s;t of the kind they had ever been engaged in. The imagination of &s;ucce&s;s, on the part of the
<PB N="427" REF="435">Commi&s;&s;ioners, mu&s;t have proceeded from the idea of what they them&s;elves would have done in the like circum&s;tances, or what they believed was lawful to be done on &s;uch an occa&s;ion. The conduct which they were in this tran&s;action authorized to pur&s;ue, marks, with the &s;tronge&s;t empha&s;is, the opinion of the mini|&s;try, with regard to treaties of the mo&s;t &s;olemn nature: that when their own ambition, pride, or intere&s;t, are to be fulfilled, they account it no crime to break a po|&s;itive agreement. If it was lawful for the Americans to break their new treaty with the French, it could be no crime in any others to do the &s;ame thing. And the mini&s;try, through the channel of their Commi&s;&s;ion|ers, were now publi&s;hing to all the world, their opinion of the faith of treaties; that they were no longer to be ob&s;erved, than &s;omething which they &s;uppo&s;ed better might be obtained. This kind of proceeding gave the world rea&s;on to believe that the charges brought again&s;t our mini&s;try in the French and Span|i&s;h re&s;cripts, were not without foundation; and that the charges of perfidy brought again&s;t the French, were more than balanced by our pre&s;ent conduct ex|pre&s;&s;ed in this new commi&s;&s;ion. Many thought that the charges of perfidy came with an ill grace from a court, that had with great &s;olemnity &s;ent out Commi&s;|&s;ioners with power and authority, to per&s;uade and in|force a reconciliation upon principles of the ba&s;e&s;t in|fidelity towards a party who had lately engaged in a treaty with an independent people. There were no rea&s;ons to per&s;uade our mini&s;try, that the Americans would keep their faith to Britain if they &s;hould pur&s;ue the doctrine they were now taught by the Engli&s;h Commi&s;&s;ioners; for men who &s;hould break &s;uch a &s;olemn treaty as they had now entered into with the
<PB N="428" REF="436">French nation, could not be &s;uppo&s;ed to be a people to be tru&s;ted in any matter what&s;oever.</P>
<P>The abandoning Philadelphia, which had been the object of near two years conte&s;t, and the precipi|tate retreat of our army, were no ways favourable to the propo&s;ed negociation. This having happened about the time of the arrival of the Commi&s;&s;ioners, was of it&s;elf &s;ufficient to have fru&s;trated the intention of the commi&s;&s;ion. Men with a commi&s;&s;ion from a &s;overeign who&s;e forces were retreating, and had ju&s;t abandoned the advantage of two years war, could not promi&s;e them&s;elves great &s;ucce&s;s in any treaty; and the more advantageous the offers which they &s;hould make in &s;uch circum&s;tances were, the more their con|ce&s;&s;ions were likely to be con&s;idered as proofs of weak|ne&s;s, and not of any good intention. The rea&s;on of the Briti&s;h troops abandoning Philadelphia, is one of tho&s;e my&s;teries of the pre&s;ent war that has not as yet been unveiled, or cleared up on this &s;ide the Atlantick, with any degree of con&s;i&s;tency. It has been alledged that the rea&s;on of this precipitate retreat proceeded from the knowledge of the French &s;quadron under D'E|&s;taing being upon the coa&s;t; but whatever might be the apprehen&s;ions of the general, from circum&s;tances he had learned in England before his embarking for America, of a French force coming to that part of the world, it is plain that neither the army nor navy ap|prehended any &s;uch thing, till after the 5th of July, when Lord Howe received the intelligence, by his cruizers, that D'E&s;taing's fleet had been &s;een on the coa&s;t of Virginia. It was indeed happy for both the fleet and army that they had made their e&s;cape before D'E&s;taing's arrival; for had the French fleet &s;hut up the Delaware, their ca&s;e would have been very critical,
<PB N="429" REF="437">if not ab&s;olutely de&s;perate. But it does not appear from any thing that has yet been publi&s;hed to the world, that this new danger was in the lea&s;t apprehend|ed by Lord Howe, who ought to have been in the &s;e|cret as well as Sir Henry Clinton, nor has General Clinton ever given it as a rea&s;on of his abandoning Philadelphia, that a French fleet was upon the coa&s;t. It would appear that the evacuation of Philadelphia was determined before Sir William Howe returned to England, and that there were &s;ome rea&s;ons independent of the arrival of the French fleet which made it ne|ce&s;&s;ary to abandon that city.</P>
<P>Experience, during the winter, had taught our ge|nerals that the Americans were determined to a&s;&s;ault them with all their force, as &s;oon as they could find a &s;uitable opportunity; they had al&s;o di&s;covered by their attack upon them at German-Town, that in ca&s;e of an univer&s;al or general engagement, that matters would at lea&s;t be doubtful. They could not remain cooped up in Philadelphia, and they could not march into the country without ri&s;king a battle with great di&s;|advantage. In ca&s;e of a defeat they could not get aboard their &s;hips but with the greate&s;t danger.&mdash; They had no hopes of any reinforcement from Bri|tain which had been promi&s;ed la&s;t year, and the troops were much weakened through &s;kirmi&s;hes, &s;ickne&s;s, and other circum&s;tances attending war and a foreign climate. It was plainly perceived, that though they were in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Philadelphia, that they could not continue in that city, nor in ca&s;e of a defeat make a &s;afe retreat from it on board their &s;hips, as there was not &s;uch free acce&s;s to &s;hips of war for their de|fence in time of embarking as at New-York.</P>
<PB N="430" REF="438">
<P>From the attack they experienced in their retreat, it plainly appears that General Wa&s;hington had his troops in readine&s;s, and was de&s;igned to have attacked them in the city of Philadelphia, or to have given them battle provided they had come to the field.&mdash; From the apprehen&s;ion of the uncertain con&s;equences of &s;uch an attack, as now all hope of &s;upply from England was lo&s;t, they thought it mo&s;t convenient to retreat to New-York, where the fleet could more conveniently a&s;&s;i&s;t, or relieve them in ca&s;e of any di&s;|a&s;ter. It was exceedingly unfavourable to the Com|mi&s;&s;ioners, that the army was obliged to make &s;uch a precipitate flight, at the very time they were offering their conciliatory propo&s;als; and it was not probable that even the wavering part of the people would give much attention to the addre&s;&s;es of Commi&s;&s;ioners with a flying army at their heels. From the very begin|ning of the war our commanders &s;eem to have had their chief dependance upon the fleet: for without the aid and a&s;&s;i&s;tance thereof they never performed any action worthy of any particular con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>The evacuation of Philadelphia was as unexpected as it was alarming to the friends of government, and their advocates were greatly at a lo&s;s to account for a mea&s;ure, the rea&s;ons of which appeared totally my&s;|terious to them. They were almo&s;t a&s;hamed to con|fe&s;s the fact it&s;elf, and for &s;ome time remained in &s;u&s;|pen&s;e concerning the authenticity of the accounts which informed them of the event. The di&s;tre&s;s of the American army during the winter, had been de|&s;cribed in &s;uch &s;trong terms, and their inability to make any longer an oppo&s;ition to the King's forces, that the retreat from Philadelphia appeared &s;o aenig|matical, that they could not tell how to account for it. It was given out that Sir Henry Clinton intended
<PB N="401" REF="439">&s;ome home &s;troke, by which he would put an end to the war, and bring the coloni&s;ts to ab&s;olute &s;ubmi&s;|&s;ion; for as the particulars of the retreat, and the &s;ub&s;equent lo&s;&s;es, were for a time concealed, it was always hoped that General Clinton had &s;ome great object in view, when he evacuated a city of &s;o much importance for its &s;ituation to the Briti&s;h forces.&mdash; What he was about to do, and the marvelous effects of his proceedings, were publi&s;hed with as much confidence as if they had already been accompli&s;hed; and tho&s;e who were no friends to General Howe, were at this time more extravagant in their predic|tions concerning the &s;ucce&s;s of Sir Henry Clinton. Whether they really believed what they affirmed is much to be doubted; it rather appeared that their expre&s;&s;ion of their hopes concerning the &s;ucce&s;s of General Clinton were intended as accu&s;ations again&s;t General Sir William Howe, for not having fulfilled their expectations in reducing the Americans. It was not long till the character of this officer was &s;everely attacked from all quarters in mini&s;terial news-papers, and pamphlets, and his &s;ervices depreciated with much rancour and abu&s;e. This was principally intended as a defence of the mini&s;try, e&s;pecially of that &s;tate offi|cer who held the American department; the advo|cates for the court, could now devi&s;e no other me|thod of defending their mea&s;ures, than by reproach|ing General Howe for partiality and inactivity in di&s;|charging the office of general. This reproach came with an ill grace from tho&s;e who had but a little time before extolled Sir William Howe, both for caution, courage, and the management of the war. The truth of the matter was, that all the officers that were &s;ent to America during this war had found in experience,
<PB N="432" REF="440">that it was different from what the mini&s;try had re|pre&s;ented it, and that all the parts of the plan for car|rying it on were founded in error and mi&s;take; that it was a plan totally disjointed and uncemented in all its principles and parts, and could be executed by no officer with any certainty of &s;ucce&s;s. It was this made all the general officers de&s;ire to be recalled one after another as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible, and to quit a &s;cene of ac|tion where there was nothing to be expected except di&s;grace and di&s;appointment. Sir William Howe be|came now the chief object of court re&s;entment, and all the mini&s;terial &s;cribblers were &s;et loo&s;e upon him, who did not &s;pare to give him a liberal &s;hare of abu&s;e. While the di&s;putants at home were vigorou&s;ly &s;up|porting their different opinions concerning the &s;ucce&s;s and i&s;&s;ue of the war, the actors on the principal &s;tage were more warmly engaged, in the hotte&s;t and warm|e&s;t &s;ea&s;on of the year, in acting their parts with various &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>Upon the 18th day of June the Briti&s;h army evacu|ated Philadelphia to the &s;urprize of all Europe. It had been given out with the greate&s;t confidence that this city, as being mo&s;t centrical, was to be held as a place of arms and re&s;ource, for carrying on the war in both the northern and &s;outhern colonies; and it was generally &s;uppo&s;ed that the Americans were not able to drive the Briti&s;h forces out of it, nor were they able to face our troops in the open field. The news of this &s;udden retreat and evacuation, greatly puzzled all the mini&s;terial connoi&s;&s;eurs in politics, and they were greatly embarra&s;&s;ed to a&s;&s;ign proper rea|&s;ons for &s;uch a ha&s;ty and precipitate mea&s;ure. Phila|delphia had been con&s;idered as a great object only twelve months before, and it was then confidently affirmed that the reduction of that city would deter|mine

<PB N="433" REF="442">the fate of America; it had only been held one winter, with much difficulty, and was now &s;uddenly given up without a&s;&s;igning any rea&s;on for &s;uch an evacuation. This gave room for many conjectures, no ways favourable to the wi&s;dom and prudence of the conductors of the war, as different parties, in judg|ing of circum&s;tances, could not in idea, form a plau|&s;ible conjecture concerning the rea&s;ons of this &s;udden and precipitate retreat; this phaenomenon was equally puzzling to the friends of the mini&s;try, and tho&s;e that were enemies to the war. It was &s;ome time before the court advocates could recover them&s;elves from the con&s;ternation into which they were thrown by this di&s;agreeable intelligence.</P>
<P>The whole Briti&s;h army pa&s;&s;ed the Delaware with|out any interruption or danger, for which they were much obliged to the good and wi&s;e management of Admiral Lord Howe, who, on that and &s;everal other occa&s;ions, di&s;covered a knowledge in his profe&s;&s;ion beyond what is common to many. General Wa&s;h|ington had received information of the de&s;ign of eva|cuating Philadelphia, and had already &s;ent General Maxwell with his brigade to reinforce the Jer&s;ey militia, and to throw all the ob&s;tructions po&s;&s;ible in the way of the march of our army; that by inter|rupting their march he him&s;elf might be enabled to bring up his force in proper time, to make an advan|tage of tho&s;e opportunities, which it was rea&s;onable to &s;uppo&s;e, &s;o long a march, through &s;o dangerous a country, would have afforded of attacking them with great &s;ucce&s;s. This detachment, when joined by the militia, broke down the bridges, but did not attack our army, becau&s;e the Briti&s;h forces were va&s;tly &s;u|perior in numbers to the American corps under the
<PB N="434" REF="443">command of General Maxwell. The latter, on ac|count of this &s;uperiority, was obliged to abandon the &s;trong pa&s;s at Mount Holly without venturing any oppo&s;ition. Notwith&s;tanding of this, Maxwell had cut out &s;o much work for our army, that their march was exceedingly &s;low, and attended with incredible fatigue; the impediments were innumerable, and the weather was exce&s;&s;ively warm, &s;o that the march of the army was fatiguing beyond the mea&s;ure of human conception. It would have required a great con&s;ciou&s;|ne&s;s of the ju&s;tice and equitablene&s;s of any cau&s;e, to have enabled men to &s;uffer &s;o much toil and labour in &s;upporting it.</P>
<P>The Briti&s;h troops were incumbered with an en|ormous baggage, comprehending provi&s;ions, and the number of wheel-carriages and loaded hor&s;es was &s;o great, as to cover the extent of twelve miles in the narrow line in which the troops were obliged to march on account of the &s;ituation of the country. One part of this incumbrance was nece&s;&s;ary for the &s;ub&s;i&s;tance of the army; for unle&s;s they had carried their provi|&s;ions along with them, they would have found none in the country through which they were marching, as all the people were their enemies, and had cut off all means of &s;ub&s;i&s;tance from the troops, which was not within their immediate comprehen&s;ion. It was therefore nece&s;&s;ity, as well as wi&s;dom, that deter|mined General Clinton to carry along with him &s;uch an enormous train of baggage. It would have argued the mo&s;t con&s;ummate folly, to have ri&s;ked the fate of a whole army, for the trouble that attended the con|veyance of a certain and &s;ufficient &s;upply of things ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary. General Maxwell's expedition began to be more and more felt; though he had not
<PB N="435" REF="444">engaged our army, nor killed any of the troops with the weapons of war, he had done them infinite mi&s;|chief. The heat of the weather, which was then exce&s;&s;ive, with the clo&s;ene&s;s of the narrow roads through the woods, and the con&s;tant labour of renew|ing and repairing bridges in a country, every where inter&s;ected with creeks, and mar&s;hy brooks, were &s;everely felt. Such hard&s;hips and difficulties could not be &s;uppo&s;ed to have been undertaken without very pre&s;&s;ing cau&s;es; and we mu&s;t certainly &s;up|po&s;e that Philadelphia was con&s;idered as a place alto|gether untenable by the Briti&s;h forces, otherwi&s;e they would not have undertaken &s;uch an hazardous and fatiguing march in a &s;ea&s;on of the year, when &s;uch enterprizes, under &s;uch circum&s;tances, are next to impo&s;&s;ible to perform. There is &s;till &s;omething of my&s;tery in this tran&s;action, which has not been con|fe&s;&s;ed by our court politicians, and which, on this &s;ide the Atlantic, has not been perfectly unveiled. Gen. Wa&s;hington, or &s;ome other of the coloni&s;ts, perhaps could unfold this my&s;tery and lay open the &s;ecret. It carries all the evidence implied in moral certainty, that our troops believed they could not keep Phila|delphia, or that our mini&s;try were mad to order &s;uch an evacuation without any &s;olid rea&s;on, and to expo&s;e the troops to &s;o much danger. From the many im|pediments which the army met with in its march, its progre&s;s was exceedingly &s;low; and this is the only rea|&s;on by which we can account for its &s;pending &s;o many days in pa&s;&s;ing through &s;o narrow a country. There were many interruptions in this march, which our ac|counts of it conceal or glo&s;s over in the mo&s;t favour|able manner. One particular difficulty which great|ly embarra&s;&s;ed the general, was, whether to take the
<PB N="436" REF="445">direct road to Staten I&s;land acro&s;s the Rariton to|wards the left, or turn from Allen's-Town to the right, and march toward the &s;ea-coa&s;t to Sandy Hook. The fir&s;t was the &s;treighte&s;t and neare&s;t march, but has &s;ome difficulties which Sir Henry Clinton de&s;ired much to avoid. He was informed that the Generals Wa&s;hington and Lee, with the American army, had already pa&s;&s;ed the Delaware; and had al&s;o heard that General Gates with the northern army was ad|vancing to join them on the Rariton. The&s;e were circum&s;tances which had not been fore&s;een in their full light, at the time of evacuating Philadelphia, when it was intended to lead the army towards the left, in the direct way to Staten I&s;land. The difficul|ty of pa&s;&s;ing the Rariton with the enemy in front, when the troops were incumbered with &s;uch heavy baggage, was a matter of the mo&s;t &s;erious con&s;idera|tion: For in ca&s;e of a defeat, or even of a repul&s;e, the provi&s;ion of the army might have been lo&s;t, and the troops reduced to the extremity of famine and di&s;tre&s;s. Be&s;ides, it appears to have been the inten|tion of General Clinton to avoid, if po&s;&s;ible, any ge|neral engagement with the provincial forces upon this occa&s;ion. Since the affair at German-Town, the Bri|ti&s;h generals had become &s;ome what more cautious in courting a general action, as they had formerly done; they had, on that occa&s;ion, experienced what the coloni&s;ts were able to attempt, and that they were not &s;o much upon the re&s;erve of &s;tanding an attack in the open field, as had been always &s;uppo&s;ed, and con&s;tantly &s;et forth in the boa&s;ting ga&s;conades of court writers. It was probably one chief rea&s;on for eva|cuating Philadelphia, that our forces might not run the hazard of a general experiment of American intre|pidity,
<PB N="437" REF="446">as in ca&s;e of any great di&s;a&s;ter ari&s;ing from &s;ome de&s;perate attack, it would have been impo&s;&s;ible to have recruited the army, or to have received a&s;|&s;i&s;tance from Britain in proper time to have &s;aved the army's total ruin. The &s;ame cau&s;e that operated in making Sir Henry Clinton abandon Philadelphia, pre|vailed in determining him, if po&s;&s;ible, to avoid an en|gagement in his march towards New-York. For the&s;e rea&s;ons, he re&s;olved to pur&s;ue the right hand cour&s;e towards the &s;ea, as the mo&s;t &s;afe and eligible in his pre&s;ent circum&s;tances.</P>
<P>General Wa&s;hington, who had cro&s;&s;ed the Dela|ware far above Philadelphia, at a place called Coryel's Ferry, was apprehen&s;ive that the &s;low motions of his enemies were intended to lead him into the low coun|try, and then, by a rapid movement on the right, en|deavour to gain po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the &s;trong grounds above him, and &s;o enclo&s;e him to the river, and force him to an engagement under every di&s;advantage. In this particular he was certainly deceived, as the &s;ituation of the Briti&s;h forces rendered them incapable of any &s;uch rapid movements; but this &s;lowne&s;s on the one &s;ide, retarded the motions of the other. It is how|ever exceedingly probable, from all the various cir|cum&s;tances attending the marches on both &s;ides, that General Wa&s;hington intended to have made his chief attack at the pa&s;&s;age of the Rariton; which from all probable circum&s;tances, he concluded would have been the cour&s;e of their march, and which he knew would have afforded great advantage in an attack. General Clinton certainly intended at fir&s;t, to have marched in the manner, and in the cour&s;e, which Wa&s;hington apprehended, until at Allen's-Town, he found that Wa&s;hington was before him; when being
<PB N="438" REF="447">apprehen&s;ive that the attack would become general, and probably the i&s;&s;ue doubtful, he was under a ne|ce&s;&s;ity of altering his march towards the &s;ea coa&s;t, by which he gained in his march, and they lo&s;t in pro|portion. It was &s;ome time before the coloni&s;ts per|ceived that the Briti&s;h forces had departed from their expected line of direction. It was nece&s;&s;ity, not de|&s;ign or fore&s;ight, as has been alledged by &s;ome, which made the Briti&s;h general change the direction of his march. When he marched out of Philadelphia, he did not imagine that his retreat would be &s;o &s;uddenly ob&s;erved, or that General Wa&s;hington would have been &s;o ready as to have gained the Rariton before he had pa&s;&s;ed it; but in this he was deceived, and for this rea&s;on he altered his march, and took the right-hand road leading to the &s;ea coa&s;t. The fleet was a &s;pecial object of his hope, which he expected would endeavour to be ready to receive his troops in ca&s;e of any di&s;a&s;ter: This was a &s;pecial rea&s;on why he altered his cour&s;e, and marched towards the coa&s;t; for it is plain that he avoided as much as po&s;&s;ible to come to any general engagement with the coloni&s;ts, while he was at a di&s;tance from the fleet.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as General Wa&s;hington perceived that the Briti&s;h troops had altered their cour&s;e, and were marching towards the &s;ea coa&s;t, he immediately chang|ed his plan, and &s;ent &s;everal detachments of his be&s;t troops, under the command of the Marquis de la Fayette, to harra&s;s the army in its march, while he advanced at a proper di&s;tance with all his force. As the advanced parties of the provincials came near to the rear of the Briti&s;h forces, and the &s;ituation be|came critical, General Wa&s;hington ordered General Lee, with two brigades, to reinforce and take the
<PB N="439" REF="448">command of the advanced corps. This party con&s;i&s;t|ed of about five thou&s;and men, according to the ac|count which General Wa&s;hington gave under his own hand. Others who &s;peak from conjecture, have &s;et forth, that this corps con&s;i&s;ted of more than five thou&s;and; but there is no certainty in this conjec|ture.</P>
<P>Sir Henry Clinton in his march to a place called Freehold, judging, from the number of the provincials that hung upon his rear, that their main body was not far di&s;tant, began to be in concern for the baggage, which had always been, for good rea&s;ons, a principal object of his attention. He wi&s;ely re&s;olved to free that part of the army from this incumbrance and impediment; he therefore placed the baggage under the management of General Knyphau&s;en, who led the fir&s;t column of the army. The other, which covered the march, was now di&s;engaged and ready for action, and was compo&s;ed of the be&s;t troops in the army, commanded by the general him&s;elf. This corps con&s;i&s;ted of the third, fourth, and fifth brigades of Briti&s;h, two battalions of Briti&s;h, and the He&s;&s;ian grenadiers, a battalion of light infanty, the guards, and the tenth regiment of light dragoons. The&s;e were troops, that had been heretofore accounted invincible, and which none of the provincials dur&s;t &s;o much as face in the open field; with the&s;e brigades Gen. Clinton endeavoured to make the be&s;t defence he could, though it appears not that he was free of fear with regard to the event; for he had ordered Gen. Knyphau&s;en to march at break of day with all the carriages and baggage, and to direct their cour&s;e to Middle-Town, which lay at twelve miles di&s;tance on their way, in an high and &s;trong country. The com|mander
<PB N="440" REF="449">in chief, with the &s;econd divi&s;ion, continued &s;ome hours on the ground in the neighbourhood of Freehold, both to cover the march of the baggage, and to afford time for the long range of carriages to get clear on their way. This caution and care was exceedingly nece&s;&s;ary as the event proved; for it was not long till the American force appeared advan|cing in their rear, and pur&s;uing them with an inten|tion to attack them.</P>
<P>Upon the 25th of June, about eight o'clock in the morning, when the army began to march, &s;ome par|ties of the provincials appeared in the woods and at|tacked the troops upon the left flank; the&s;e being only flying parties, were made to retire by the light troops. But as the rear-guard de&s;cended from the heights of Freehold, into a valley about three miles in length and one in breadth, &s;everal columns of the coloni&s;ts appeared al&s;o de&s;cending into the plain, who about ten o'clock began to cannonade the rear. At the &s;ame time that this attack was made upon the rear, the general received intelligence that two &s;trong bodies of troops were marching to flank the army; this, in the modern military &s;tile, was called march|ing in force on both &s;ides to attack them in the flanks. This greatly alarmed the general, for he perceived that it was their de&s;ign to attack the baggage, and as the carriages were then entangled in narrow defiles for &s;ome miles, it &s;eemed a matter of the greate&s;t con|&s;equence to guard again&s;t this danger. As the affair appeared to be critical, the general devi&s;ed the only method that could have been at that time fallen upon to deliver him&s;elf out of that embarra&s;&s;ment. He re|&s;olved to make a vigorous attack upon that body which hung upon his rear and harra&s;&s;ed it, which he con|cluded
<PB N="441" REF="450">would call back the flanking parties to the a&s;|&s;i&s;tance of tho&s;e that were thus engaged, and thereby give an opportunity to the baggage to e&s;cape. For although General Wa&s;hington was marching with his whole army, which was believed to be far greater than it really was, yet as the main body was &s;epa|rated from this advanced corps which attacked Lord Cornwallis in the rear, by two con&s;iderable defiles, he did not imagine that he could pa&s;s a greater body of troops through the&s;e narrows, during the execution of that mea&s;ure which he intended, than what the force along with him was able to oppo&s;e; whil&s;t on the other hand, even with that divi&s;ion of the army, Wa&s;hington's &s;ituation would be &s;ufficiently critical, provided he &s;hould come upon him, whil&s;t he was &s;truggling in the defiles. He was however doubtful of this matter, and to guard again&s;t every po&s;&s;ible re|&s;ult that might happen in ca&s;e of a general engage|ment, he called back a brigade of the Briti&s;h infantry, and the &s;eventeenth regiment of light dragoons from Knyphau&s;en's divi&s;ion, and left them orders to take a po&s;t which would effectually cover his right flank, being the &s;ide on which he was mo&s;t jealous of being attacked. In the mean time the Queen's light dra|goons had engaged with &s;ome of the American ca|valry, under the Marquis de Fayette, and put them to flight, and had driven them back upon their own foot. The General then made di&s;po&s;itions to attack the Americans in the plain; but before he could ad|vance, the unexpectedly fell back, and po&s;ted them|&s;elves in a &s;trong &s;ituation, on the heights above Monmouth Hou&s;e. The weather in this &s;ea&s;on of the year is in tho&s;e parts always exceedingly warm; but upon this day it was &s;o violently hot as to be
<PB N="442" REF="451">&s;carcely exceeded by the mo&s;t &s;ultry &s;ummers of that continent. This was a very di&s;agreeable circum&s;tance to our army, which was already very much fatigued by their march, and the &s;evere labour of clearing the way and repairing bridges. The mo&s;t vigorous ex|ertions were, however, at this time nece&s;&s;ary, and the circum&s;tances of our army required a more than ordinary vigour to make good their march, and &s;ave their baggage. The Briti&s;h grenadiers had now &s;uf|ficient employment for all their valour and intrepidity: This body, with the village of Freehold on their left and the guards on their right, began the attack with great fury. The provincials were aware of their im|petuo&s;ity, and guarded again&s;t the effects of it; and according to appointment, gave way after a &s;hort attack, and led their enemy directly upon the &s;econd line, which was ready to receive them. It was here the very flower of the Briti&s;h army was re&s;i&s;ted in a manner they never expected: Their fierce attack was re&s;olutely &s;u&s;tained, and their fury &s;o much abated by the bold re&s;i&s;tance of the coloni&s;ts, that they were forced to be witne&s;&s;es of their enemies forming them|&s;elves, when they thought they had totally routed them, in a new advantageous po&s;t, from whence they were not able to drive them. Our accounts of this engagement are very unfairly given, and the circum&s;tances of this battle are de&s;cribed with &s;uch a partiality to Sir Henry Clinton, and the valour of the Briti&s;h troops, that the writers them&s;elves, in&s;tead of doing honour to the general and his men, afford &s;uf|ficient hints to enable others to infer, that there was much more under&s;tood than they were willing to expre&s;s. They allow that, according to their own &s;tile, after the enemy was completely routed, they,
<PB N="443" REF="452">with a very unu&s;ual degree of recollection as well as re&s;olution, took a third po&s;ition with &s;o much judg|ment, that their front was covered by a mar&s;hy hol|low, which &s;carcely admitted the po&s;&s;ibility of an at|tack. This does not well agree with a complete and total defeat. The truth of the matter is, that the whole manner and method of the coloni&s;ts proceeding was but one plan. They perceived the intention of the Briti&s;h general, and knew the pre&s;&s;ing circum|&s;tances he was in: that he intended to make a re|&s;olute and vigorous attack to &s;ave his baggage, and if po&s;&s;ible to defeat that advanced party that hung upon his rear. They therefore provided again&s;t a de&s;perate attack, by forming in two lines, and taking new po&s;ts, to which they retired regularly when they were &s;everely pre&s;&s;ed. This both &s;aved their men, and fatigued their enemy, and afforded new advan|tages, which the Engli&s;h forces could not obtain. By the re&s;i&s;tance which our men had met with from the fir&s;t and &s;econd lines, but e&s;pecially from the &s;econd, their vigour was &s;ufficiently abated, and they found from experience that tho&s;e men whom they had &s;o often determined to be cowards, were very different from what they apprehended.</P>
<P>General Clinton found, from the vigorous re&s;i&s;tance the provincials had made again&s;t his be&s;t troops, and from the po&s;t they had now taken, that the i&s;&s;ue would be very doubtful, &s;hould he attempt to di&s;|lodge them from the po&s;t they were now in. After he had made &s;ome di&s;po&s;itions, as if he meant to attack them, by bringing up the &s;econd line, and making the light infantry and rangers turn to the left, he de&s;i&s;ted from the attempt. His be&s;t troops had now done
<PB N="444" REF="453">all that they were able to do; they were overpower|ed with heat, wearied with fatigue, and had been &s;everely handled in the two former attacks; and the others that were now ready to have made the third, were neither of the &s;ame character for intrepidity, nor in ca&s;e of a repul&s;e, were they likely to have made a good retreat in their pre&s;ent &s;ituation. He therefore thought it better not to pre&s;s the affair any further. In this he behaved prudently, for as he had as yet been engaged with but a part of the American army, and the main force was advancing, he would have been obliged to have engaged fre&s;h troops, with an army already very much fatigued by the former actions. He had &s;o far gained his inten|tion, with regard to the baggage, as the convoy was now without the reach of danger. The American army made a bold attempt to cut off the retreat of the light infantry, which laid the general under the nece&s;&s;ity of making &s;ome new arrangements, which, con&s;idering the exce&s;&s;ive heat of the day, were ex|ceedingly difficult to be effected, but were ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for the pre&s;ervation of the army. The Briti&s;h forces at length returned to the po&s;t, from whence the provincials had at fir&s;t retreated, after quitting the plain.</P>
<P>The event ju&s;tified the opinion of General Clinton, with re&s;pect to the Americans de&s;ign on the baggage, and the propriety of his attacking the provincials at the time, and in the manner he did. Two brigades of the American light troops had pa&s;&s;ed our army, one on each flank, with that view, and had made the attempt, but were repul&s;ed by the fortieth regiment and the light hor&s;e. Matters, however, were like
<PB N="445" REF="454">to turn very &s;erious and critical, and Sir Henry Clin|ton began to perceive, &s;hould he per&s;i&s;t in the engage|ment, that the i&s;&s;ue would be very doubtful, as the coloni&s;ts were advancing, and &s;eemed eager in main|taining the di&s;pute; he therefore thought it prudent to pur&s;ue the baggage as fa&s;t as he was able. Our accounts of this affair &s;et it forth in this manner: "Sir Henry Clinton having now fully attained his object, for the Generals Knyphau&s;en and Grant, with the fir&s;t divi&s;ion and baggage, were arrived at Nut-Swamp near Middletown, could have no inducement for continuing in his pre&s;ent &s;ituation. The troops had already gained &s;ufficient honour, in forcing &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ively from two &s;trong po&s;itions, a corps of the enemy, which he was informed, amounted to near 12,000 men, and the merit of the &s;ervice was much enhanced by the unequalled circum&s;tances of heat and fatigue under which it was performed. The enemy were much &s;uperior in force to the divi&s;ion immedi|ately under his command; and if the equality had been even nearer, it would &s;till have &s;eemed imprudent to have hazarded an engagement, at &s;uch a di&s;tance from the re&s;t of his army, in a country not only ho&s;|tile, but which, from its nature, mu&s;t have been ruinous to &s;trangers, under any circum&s;tance of de|feat. And as the heat of the weather rendered marching by day intolerable, &s;o the moon light ad|ded to the elegibility of the night, for that purpo&s;e. Upon &s;ome or all of the&s;e accounts, the troops hav|ing repo&s;ed till ten o'clock, the army was again put in motion, and they marched forward to join their fellows."</P>

<P>When matters are faithfully compared, it does not appear that there were any &s;uch great numbers of American troops pre&s;ent at this engagement: That only the 5000 men that were &s;ent to harra&s;s the march of our troops, were all the force that had yet been engaged. That tho&s;e troops, by the order of Gen. Lee, had retreated, and were again rallied by the command of General Wa&s;hington, and made &s;uch an impre&s;&s;ion upon our forces, as gave the General rea&s;on to believe, that, provided he &s;hould adven|ture the i&s;&s;ue of the action, it would at lea&s;t be very doubtful. It was plain to the impartial part of our army, that the coloni&s;ts upon this occa&s;ion, with&s;tood, with much bravery, the very be&s;t of our troops, and &s;eemed to behave like veteran &s;oldiers. The grena|diers, the very cho&s;en troops from all the regiments, together with the guards, who generally claim the po&s;t of honour, found in experience, that they could &s;upport their honour with difficulty, again&s;t the at|tacks of men who fought for the rights of human nature, more than for the empty honours of war. The former boa&s;ting of our officers and men, and the contempt in which they held the Americans, began now more to decrea&s;e, and our officers began to find that caution was now a very nece&s;&s;ary part of practice in carrying on the American war.</P>
<P>The lo&s;s on our &s;ide is repre&s;ented as very incon|&s;iderable in point of the number of the &s;lain, but particularly grievous by the lo&s;s of the brave Colo|nel Monkton, who had behaved with much military bravery in &s;everal former actions, and had been grievou&s;ly wounded, both in the la&s;t war and the pre&s;ent. After &s;everal narrow e&s;capes in the field,
<PB N="447" REF="456">he was re&s;erved to be killed on this day, at the head of the &s;econd battalion of grenadiers. A very parti|cular circum&s;tance rendered this day and action re|markable, and unparallelled in the Hi&s;tory of Ame|rica. Fifty-nine &s;oldiers peri&s;hed, without receiving a wound, merely through exce&s;&s;ive heat and fatigue. Some of the Americans are &s;aid to have &s;uffered in the &s;ame manner, though bred in the country and inured to the climate. Of all the actions &s;ince the commencement of the war, our troops were in this expo&s;ed to the greate&s;t hard&s;hips, though they &s;u&s;|tained greater lo&s;s of men in &s;ome others. A good part of the management of this retreat, and conduct|ing of our troops out of danger, depended upon Ge|neral Grey, whom our accounts do not mention in the whole of this affair: He had &s;ome narrow e&s;capes, having his hor&s;e killed under him, and the heads of &s;ome &s;oldiers, which had been taken off by cannon|balls, lying be&s;ide him, when he recovered from the entanglement of his hor&s;e. And there is much rea|&s;on to conclude that the lo&s;s of this day has not as yet been fully a&s;certained. The account which the Americans give of the lo&s;s on our &s;ide is different from ours, and has &s;ome internal marks of authen|ticity in them, not &s;o clearly to be perceived in our official repre&s;entations. From the plaine&s;t and be&s;t accounts it appears, that though our men behaved with much bravery, yet they were hard pre&s;&s;ed, and with difficulty &s;upported their march, which they were obliged to do in the night, when they e&s;caped by the favour of darkne&s;s.</P>
<P>The Americans claimed great honour to that de|tachment of their troops, which was engaged in the
<PB N="448" REF="457">action; they al&s;o claimed the advantage in the engage|ment, though our people affirm that they did this without any ground. However it mu&s;t be allowed to have been a con&s;iderable advantage to the Ame|ricans, to know that they could engage the be&s;t troops in Britain in the open field, and with equal, if not inferior numbers, with&s;tand them, and even in the conclu&s;ion make them glad to retreat with con&s;idera|ble lo&s;s. It had often been &s;aid that our officers and men, de&s;ired nothing &s;o much as to have an opportu|nity of engaging the provincials in the open field, when they were fully a&s;&s;ured that they could fight them at any odds what&s;oever. The time was now ar|rived when they might ea&s;ily have made the experi|ment, and verified this declaration to the world. The Americans, in&s;tead of being much more numerous than our men, do not appear to have had equal num|bers engaged in this action; and yet they not only &s;tood their ground, but obliged their enemies to re|treat with &s;uch precipitation, as had all the ex|ternal marks of a flight. From all accounts that can be depended upon, it cannot as yet be made appear, that General Wa&s;hington had more troops in his whole army, than Sir Henry Clinton had in his; it mu&s;t therefore proceed from other cau&s;es than &s;upe|riority of numbers, that the coloni&s;ts had any advan|tage in this action. There were &s;ome particular things, that were much again&s;t them. The behaviour of one of their own generals appears to have been much to blame, and tended much to have interrupted their march: From what principle he acted, is be&s;t known to him&s;elf, but it is &s;ufficiently evident that he di&s;obeyed the orders of his commander in chief, by
<PB N="449" REF="458">ordering his detachment to retreat, when there was vi&s;ibly no occa&s;ion; for that &s;ame corps under another commander, recovered their &s;tation, and &s;upported it till their enemies fled in the night, and got out of their reach. The Americans them&s;elves affirm, that they would have obtained a complete and deci&s;ive victory, if it had not been from the conduct and di&s;|obedience of General Lee. That officer had, &s;ome time before, by an exchange, obtained a relea&s;e from his long confinement at New York; and we have already ob&s;erved that he was appointed to take the command of that detachment, which was ordered to harra&s;s the Briti&s;h army, and to interrupt its march.</P>
<P>It appears from General Wa&s;hington's account of the action, that had General Lee obeyed his orders, and not retired after the fir&s;t fire, that the Briti&s;h troops would have been more &s;everely handled; for as the&s;e very &s;ame troops rallied and &s;upported their &s;tation after they had retreated, provided they had &s;tood their ground at fir&s;t, the action would have been more &s;harp and bloody. General Wa&s;hington &s;ays, that being informed, that if once the Briti&s;h army gained the high and &s;trong country of Middle-Town, no attempt could afterwards be made upon them, with the &s;malle&s;t pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s, he ac|cordingly determined to fall upon their rear, immedi|ately upon their departure from the &s;trong grounds in the neighbourhood of Freehold, on which they had encamped during the night of the twenty-&s;eventh. He communicated the intention to General Lee, with orders to make his di&s;po&s;ition for the attack, and to keep the troops lying upon their arms in con&s;tant pre|paration;
<PB N="450" REF="459">which he al&s;o practi&s;ed him&s;elf in the main body. Having received an expre&s;s at five in the morning, that the Briti&s;h army had begun their march, he immediately di&s;patched an order to General Lee to attack them, acquainting him at the &s;ame time, that he was marching directly to &s;upport him, and that for the greater expedition, he &s;hould cau&s;e his men to di&s;encumber them&s;elves of that part of the baggage which they carried upon their backs. To his great &s;urprize and mortification however, when he had marched about five miles, he met the whole advanced corps retreating, which they informed him was by the order of General Lee, without their making the &s;malle&s;t oppo&s;ition, excepting the &s;ingle fire of one detachment, to repul&s;e the Briti&s;h Light Hor&s;e. General Wa&s;hington found the rear of the retreating troops hard pre&s;&s;ed by our forces; but by forming them anew, under the brave and &s;pirited ex|ertion of their officers, he &s;oon checked the advance of the Briti&s;h forces; and having by this means gain|ed time to plant &s;ome batteries of cannon, and to bring up fre&s;h forces, the engagement hung in an equal poize for &s;ome time. In this this &s;ituation (he continues) the enemy finding them&s;elves warmly op|po&s;ed in front, made an attempt to turn his left flank; but were bravely repul&s;ed by &s;ome detached parties of infantry. A &s;imilar attempt upon the right was made, and they were repul&s;ed by General Green, who afterwards, in conjunction with General Waine, took &s;uch po&s;ts, and kept up &s;o &s;evere and well-directed a fire, as compelled the Briti&s;h forces to retire behind a defile, where the fir&s;t &s;tand had been made, in the beginning of the action. In that &s;itua|tion
<PB N="451" REF="460">in which their flanks were &s;ecured by thick woods and mora&s;&s;es, and their front only a&s;&s;ailable through a narrow defile, he notwith&s;tanding made di&s;po&s;itions for attacking; but the darkne&s;s came on &s;o fa&s;t, as not to afford time for &s;urmounting the im|pediments in their way. The main body, however, lay all night upon their arms, in the place of action, as the detached parties did in their &s;everal po&s;ts which they had been ordered to take, under a full determination of attacking the Briti&s;h army when the day appeared; but the Briti&s;h forces retreated in &s;uch profound &s;ilence in the night, that the mo&s;t advanced po&s;ts, and tho&s;e very near them, knew nothing of their departure until the morning.</P>
<P>Our account of this action is not only imperfect, but contrary to that which General Wa&s;hington has given; but we may gather from the circum&s;tances of both, that the Briti&s;h troops were far from being vic|torious on this occa&s;ion. It would have been much to their intere&s;t as well as their honour, now, that they had the Americans in the open field, where they had long profe&s;&s;ed to wi&s;h to have them, to have &s;hewn their ab&s;olute &s;uperiority, by defeating this army, which would have tended much to have brought the coloni&s;ts to the terms of the Commi&s;&s;ioners, who were now waiting to bring the Americans to &s;ome temper, with regard to their ideas of reconciliation. Nothing could be more unfortunate than this affair, to the de&s;igns of the Commi&s;&s;ioners: Their threaten|ings were now de&s;pi&s;ed, and the boa&s;ted valour of the Briti&s;h forces con&s;idered only in a common point of light. The be&s;t troops in the Engli&s;h army had now been made to retreat, before men, to whom they had
<PB N="452" REF="461">long given the names of a rabble, cowards, and pol|troons. This was not likely to operate favourably in behalf of the wi&s;hes of the Commi&s;&s;ioners. It is plain from all circum&s;tances, that our troops had a fair opportunity to exert all their valour, &s;eeing the very guards and the invincible grenadiers had ju&s;t as much duty in this action as they were able to perform; and yet &s;o far were the coloni&s;ts from giving ground or running away, that they lay all night upon their arms waiting to renew the action in the morning, when our brave men &s;lipt away &s;ilently in the night, and got beyond the reach of danger.</P>
<P>It was undoubtedly wi&s;e and prudent in Sir Henry Clinton to take the mea&s;ures which he adopted to &s;ave his army; for it does not appear that, &s;uppo&s;e he had engaged with all his forces, and &s;tood a ge|neral action to the end, he would have had any hopes of any other &s;ort of victory, than would have ruined him. The Americans were determined to have &s;tood to the utmo&s;t, and from what happened during the time of this action, it appears, what might have been the i&s;&s;ue, provided it had been general. Ge|neral Clinton had for&s;een this from the beginning, and endeavoured to guard again&s;t the fatal con&s;e|quences he perceived would follow a ra&s;h and general engagement. Both he and Sir William Howe had perceived, &s;ince the affair of German Town, that without greater reinforcements than they had rea&s;on to expect from Britain, that a general action would be very dangerous. They found they had to encoun|ter a General, who was not ea&s;ily to be circumvent|ed, and who&s;e troops had now by experience, both learned the art of war, and had acquired that mecha|nical
<PB N="453" REF="462">courage which proceeds from frequent action; and what was more, were animated with ideas of li|berty, a thing for which tho&s;e, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of great minds, will rather die than live without. The &s;laves of arbitrary power, when under &s;trict di&s;cipline, and the command of good officers, will occa&s;ionally fight bravely, but when the action is over, they cool and turn languid for want of animating principles; but the &s;pirit of liberty is a natural and perpetual fire, that never cea&s;es to animate the heart till all virtue is gone, and then there is nothing worthy of &s;triving about. The &s;peculations of &s;ome &s;elfi&s;h men con|cerning duty and obedience to government, may plea&s;e them&s;elves and their party, either for a cham|ber meditation, or a blinding apology for unju&s;tifiable actions, but will never &s;atisfy any rational enquirer, who has nothing except truth for the object of his enquiry. To &s;uppo&s;e that there are not limits &s;et to power, as well as known rules of obedience, beyond which neither governors nor &s;ubjects ought to pro|ceed, is to introduce a &s;ceptici&s;m in government, that will &s;oon put an end to all order, right, and pro|perty. The claims of rulers will always encrea&s;e, unle&s;s circum&s;cribed by laws, till they leave nothing for others to enjoy except what depends upon their grace and favour; and provided that they were ab|&s;olutely perfect, and full of grace and truth, there would be no danger from their encroachments: But as the world affords &s;o many in&s;tances of gracele&s;s rulers, it is nece&s;&s;ary we &s;hould have &s;ome better &s;e|curity for our privileges, than their favour. Men that carry their views no further than the immediate gratification of their appetites, or their own private
<PB N="454" REF="463">worldly intere&s;t, will proceed according to the feel|ings which the&s;e produce; but remove the&s;e and they have no &s;prings of action. Generous and liberal minds extend their good wi&s;hed to all men, and con|&s;ider their own private intere&s;t in&s;eparably connected with the common weal. Hence they are influenced to oppo&s;e every power that encroaches upon the common rights of mankind, and find them&s;elves obliged to re&s;i&s;t it as the common enemy of &s;ociety.</P>
<P>The number of killed and wounded in the action of this day has never been exactly a&s;certained; for the Americans declared that they buried four times as many of the Briti&s;h troops, as our accounts &s;ay were killed. How many of the coloni&s;ts were killed in this action, it was impo&s;&s;ible for the Briti&s;h army to know, as they left the field to their enemy, and retreated as fa&s;t as they could. Our Gazette could with no pro|priety give a li&s;t of any more killed on the &s;ide of the Americans, than they acknowledge in their accounts, becau&s;e our mini&s;try could have no certainty with re|gard to the matter of fact. General Wa&s;hington &s;ays that our men carried off their wounded, except four officers and about forty &s;oldiers: This he could not know except by one of the&s;e two ways, ei|ther by being informed by the wounded which were left in the field, or by computing the proportion of the wounded to the &s;lain they had buried; and if it be true what our accounts have con&s;tantly a&s;&s;erted, that the proportion of wounded on our &s;ide was al|ways much greater than the &s;lain, there mu&s;t have been a great number of wounded carried off the field by the army. It is highly probable that the accounts on both &s;ides may not be exactly according to truth;
<PB N="455" REF="464">but it may rea&s;onably be &s;uppo&s;ed, that as the Ame|rican cannon were for a time well &s;erved, and played with great fury upon our be&s;t troops, that more were wounded than four officers and forty &s;oldiers. Ever &s;ince the action of Bunker's Hill, we have rea&s;on to be &s;u&s;picious of our Gazette account of the killed and wounded, in the &s;everal actions which happened in America.</P>
<P>After this action, both the commanders in chief highly commended the behaviour of their officers and men; and there were undoubtedly good rea&s;on for &s;uch commendation on both &s;ides, &s;o far as the prai&s;e extended to courage and bravery; but in point of morality there mu&s;t have been a great difference on the one &s;ide or the other. Many lives were lo&s;t, and much blood &s;pilt, which might have been &s;pared, had not that unhappy di&s;pute commenced. One can|not read the hi&s;tory of &s;uch fatal tran&s;actions, without reflecting upon the rea&s;ons and cau&s;es of them; for it always implies &s;ome great error on one &s;ide, or perhaps on both, when &s;uch ho&s;tile proceedings are pur&s;ued. In all civil wars recorded in hi&s;tory, their cau&s;es and &s;prings have been derived from bad go|vernment, or from bad admini&s;tration of the laws and police of nations: The people have never been un|rea&s;onable when governments have been virtuous, nor has it been found that &s;ubjects thought of revolt|ing or rebelling till they were evidently oppre&s;&s;ed. It is an ea&s;y matter for tho&s;e that are &s;upported by the &s;poils of others, to cry out again&s;t them as factious and rebellious, but were they to change places and circum&s;tances, it would make a great alteration. All governments recorded in hi&s;tory have, when they de|parted
<PB N="456" REF="465">from the principles of the con&s;titutions of na|tions, been ready to call out again&s;t rebellion in their &s;ubjects, when they oppo&s;ed their oppre&s;&s;ive and ab&s;urd mea&s;ures; the force of rea&s;on and ju&s;tice bears but little weight with men who are determined upon &s;upporting their own mea&s;ures, for the &s;ake of gratifying their lu&s;t of power, or the cravings of ap|petite.</P>
<P>General Wa&s;hington gave high and unu&s;ual prai&s;e to his officers and men, and expre&s;&s;ed his obligations to their zeal and bravery: He &s;aid the behaviour of the troops in general, after they had recovered from the &s;urprize occa&s;ioned by the retreat of the advanced party, was &s;uch as could not be &s;urpa&s;&s;ed; and he repre&s;ented them to the Congre&s;s in &s;uch a light as made that body expre&s;s their mo&s;t zealous acknow|ledgment of their &s;ervice, in the mo&s;t public manner. Such a public approbation from the Congre&s;s was very nattering to the army, but particularly to the com|mander in chief and his officers; in which they con|&s;idered this action as a battle, and the re&s;ult as a great and important victory, obtained over the grand Briti&s;h army, under the immediate command of their general. In this they were not altogether wrong, for though the trophies of victory were &s;mall, yet they kept the field, and the Briti&s;h troops retreated, which had all the u&s;ual appearances of a victory: and this victory was &s;o compleat as to clear both the Jer&s;ies and Phi|ladelphia, of an enemy that had done them much injury.</P>
<P>The evacuation of the city of Philadelphia, and the night of the Briti&s;h army through the Jer&s;ies to New-York, was equal to a victory in the view of the Ame|ricans.
<PB N="457" REF="466">It &s;hewed them that our army did not con|&s;ider them&s;elves of &s;ufficient force to adventure &s;outh|ward to Virginia, or Maryland, without the a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance of the fleet; and that, without the aid of the navy, they were at pre&s;ent able to make no import|ant conque&s;ts. The conjectures concerning this pre|cipitate flight among parties at home was various, and there were few that could determine certainly, what were the real cau&s;es thereof. The friends of the court and the mini&s;try repre&s;ented this retreat of Sir Henry Clinton, as a military exploit, almo&s;t equal to that of Xenophon and the ten thou&s;and Greeks, &s;o much famed in antient hi&s;tory; and it was &s;aid that nothing &s;o great and glorious had been performed &s;ince the beginning of this war: That General Clin|ton would now &s;oon bring the Americans to a &s;en&s;e of their duty, and the war to a happy and glorious conclu&s;ion. Such was the infatuation of the party, that our greate&s;t lo&s;&s;es were interpreted advantages; and what all the world con&s;idered as our di&s;grace, was con&s;idered by tho&s;e commentators as our glory and honour. There were others who con&s;idered the flight from Philadelphia in another point of view, and probably in its true light: They &s;aid that our troops could not keep po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Philadelphia without ri&s;k|ing an engagement, and that the danger from &s;uch a proceeding would have been exceedingly great. That as they had now no expectations of any rein|forcement from Britain for a &s;ea&s;on, and were uncer|tain when any might be &s;ent, they were under a nece&s;|&s;ity to &s;ecure them&s;elves in the be&s;t manner they could, and always keep near to the &s;ea, where they might have free acce&s;s to their &s;hips, in ca&s;e of imminent danger. There had been no force &s;ent to America.
<PB N="458" REF="467">&s;ince the beginning of the war, that was competent to make a conque&s;t of that continent by land; the troops dur&s;t never proceed far into the country, for when they advanced any di&s;tance from their &s;hips, they were &s;ure to meet with &s;uch vigorous attacks, as taught them the danger of the enterprize by re|ducing their numbers. Nothing could be more ro|mantic than to imagine that men would give up their liberties, and become &s;laves, when they had health and &s;trength, and arms in their hands; or that they would tamely give up all that is dear to men without making all the re&s;i&s;tance they could. Three millions of people, upon their own ground, and in a country which they know and are acquainted with, will defend them&s;elves again&s;t any quantity that can be &s;ent out of &s;even millions, at the di&s;tance of three thou&s;and miles, acro&s;s a tempe&s;tuous ocean, through the va|rious chances of winds, tides, and &s;torms. It is an ea&s;y matter to form plans and make up e&s;timates upon paper, to draw charts and de&s;cribe voyages in a ca|binet; but it is quite a different matter to mu&s;ter troops, man fleets, and conduct them acro&s;s the At|lantic to America. What all wi&s;e impartial people fore&s;aw, from the beginning of this unhappy and unnatural war, the mini&s;try at la&s;t in experience found and could tell, provided their pride and ambition would permit them, how difficult it is to carry on war in America. The war with France and Spain, while we had the coloni&s;ts to a&s;&s;i&s;t us, was but play to this new, impolitic, and unrighteous enterprize.</P>
<P>The Briti&s;h troops having made the be&s;t of their way during the night after this engagement, had ad|vanced &s;o far, as rendered the pur&s;uit impracticable, and all attempts to interrupt their embarkation at
<PB N="459" REF="468">Sandy-Hook, fruitle&s;s. For this rea&s;on General Wa&s;hington detached &s;ome light troops to ob&s;erve the motions of the enemy, and drew off the main body of his army to the borders of the North River. The lo&s;s of the coloni&s;ts, in point of killed and wounded, was not great, but they lo&s;t two good officers, who were much lamented: Colonel Bonner of Penn&s;yl|vania, and Major Dicken&s;on of Virginia, the lo&s;s of whom was &s;everely felt.</P>
<P>There was a circum&s;tance which happened in this engagement, which occa&s;ioned &s;ome &s;peculation both in America and at home, and produced different ef|fects in the minds of different parties. The behaviour of General Lee was &s;everely cen&s;ured by General Wa&s;hington, who is al&s;o &s;aid to have u&s;ed &s;ome very har&s;h and &s;evere expre&s;&s;ions, in the face of the army, when he met General Lee, on the retreat of his corps from the place of action, amounting to a direct charge of di&s;obedience of orders, want of conduct, or want of courage. This produced two pa&s;&s;ionate letters from General Lee, who was now put under arre&s;t, with an an&s;wer from General Wa&s;hington on the &s;ame day or night of the action. A court-martial was in&s;tantly demanded, and as in&s;tantly appointed, and &s;o &s;peedily carried into execution, as to be open|ed at Brun&s;wick on the fourth of July. The charges brought again&s;t General Lee were: Fir&s;t, di&s;obedi|ence of orders, in not attacking the enemy upon the 28th of June, agreeable to repeated in&s;tructions: For mi&s;behaviour before the enemy on the &s;ame day, by making an unnece&s;&s;ary, di&s;orderly, and &s;hameful re|treat: And la&s;tly, for di&s;re&s;pect to the commander in thief, by the two letters that have been mentioned. The re&s;ult of the court, after a trial which la&s;ted until
<PB N="460" REF="469">the 12th of Augu&s;t, was, the finding of General Lee guilty of the fir&s;t charge; the finding him in part guilty of the &s;econd, of mi&s;behaviour before the ene|my, by making an unnece&s;&s;ary, and in &s;ome few in|&s;tances, a di&s;orderly retreat. They al&s;o found him guilty of di&s;re&s;pect to the commander in chief; and &s;entenced him to be &s;u&s;pended from any command in the armies of the United Sates, for the term of 12 months. To form a ju&s;t and true opinion of the ju&s;tice of this &s;entence, it would be nece&s;&s;ary to know the &s;everal particulars of the charges, with their cir|cum&s;tances as they really &s;tood. According to what appears from General Lee's own letter, and the Ame|rican account of the action, it would appear that Ge|neral Lee either failed in obedience to command, or was deficient in his u&s;ual courage and intrepidity. This might probably ari&s;e from certain mechanical rea&s;ons which will upon occa&s;ions affect the mo&s;t brave and courageous. He had been long under &s;evere confinement, and had been very hardly u&s;ed; the man|ner of his confinement, and the want of nece&s;&s;ary fre&s;h air, and whole&s;ome food, might reduce his con|&s;titution and affect his nerves, whereby he might per|ceive objects of danger in a different light, from what he would have done in his ordinary &s;tate of vigour. It is not improbable that he might have a real want of nece&s;&s;ary courage for &s;uch an important command at this time, and for fear of mi&s;managing through ra&s;hne&s;s, might through that apprehen&s;ion be defi|cient in what otherwi&s;e was his duty. Though in all this he could not be criminal, yet the operation was the &s;ame in the action, as if it bad been done with de|&s;ign; and as the court were only to proceed upon common rea&s;ons, according to the evidence before
<PB N="461" REF="470">them, they were not likely to find any apology for an action that had a tendency to produce &s;uch fatal con&s;equences. It does not appear that there was any partiality in the behaviour of the court martial, nor did General Lee afterwards complain of their &s;en|tence; the nece&s;&s;ity of the time required that every &s;tep of mi&s;conduct in officers &s;hould be marked with di&s;plea&s;ure, that others might take warning, and pay proper regard to their duty. The di&s;cipline of free &s;tates, in all ages, when there were virtue and vigour in their con&s;titution, has been repre&s;ented by hi&s;tory, as exact and &s;evere; and though they have been zealous for liberty, and jealous of the rights of man|kind; yet they con&s;idered a man's engaging to per|form a duty, which he either could not, or would not perform, a crime puni&s;hable by the laws: and that it is not incon&s;i&s;tent with liberty, to mark with di&s;ap|probation, manife&s;t neglect of duty, or betraying of tru&s;t. The freedom of the people, in all free na|tions, can only be &s;upported by a &s;trict adherence to the laws that are in&s;tituted for the &s;upport thereof. To be remi&s;s in executing the&s;e laws, is the ready way to lo&s;e liberty. If men, in forming of States, were &s;o wi&s;e as to make no more articles than are ne|ce&s;&s;ary to &s;upport that freedom they want to main|tain, and never to turn remi&s;s in the admini&s;tration of them, it would be the only thing to continue liber|ty and national felicity. Partiality in admini&s;tering ju&s;tice, is a &s;ure way to de&s;troy freedom; this has been the bane of nations, and the ruin of empires. Strict and exact di&s;cipline in armies, upon principles of ju&s;tice, is nece&s;&s;ary to keep every one to their duty; but it ought at the &s;ame time to be con&s;idered, that no more duties ought to be impo&s;ed, than rea&s;on and ju&s;tice
<PB N="462" REF="471"><GAP DESC="MISSING">requires every man, in his &s;tation or rank, to fulfil. To multiply duties beyond the limits of nece&s;&s;ity or ju&s;tice, is to create tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions by law. What is ju&s;t and rea&s;onable is ea&s;ily perceived, and men can have no di&s;pute concerning this point, if they will only judge concerning others, as they would wi&s;h them to judge if the ca&s;e was their own. But this can only happen when virtue is predominant, and when the common weal takes place of all private intere&s;t.</P>
<P>The Briti&s;h army, after much fatigue and wearine&s;s, through the heat of the weather and the labour in the late action, arrived at the heights of Nave&s;ink in the neighbourhood of Sandy-hook, on the la&s;t day of June; where they were met by the fleet under Lord Howe, from the Delaware, where they had been de|tained by calms in the river for &s;ome time, but had mo&s;t fortunately arrived the day before the approach of the army. It was a very fortunate circum&s;tance for our army, that the fleet was &s;o ready to receive them, otherwi&s;e they might have been in great jeo|pardy, had the Americans pur&s;ued them clo&s;e. In the preceding winter, the penin&s;ula of Sandy hook had been cut off from the continent, and converted into an ab&s;olute i&s;land by a violent breach of the &s;ea; a circum&s;tance then of little con&s;equence, but which might now have been fatal to our army. By the for|tunate arrival of the fleet, at the in&s;tant when its a&s;|&s;i&s;tance was &s;o critically nece&s;&s;ary, by the ability of the noble commander, and the extraordinary efforts of the &s;eamen, this impediment was &s;peedily removed. A bridge of boats was compleated with great expedi|tion, and the whole army pa&s;&s;ed over this new channel on the 5th of July, and were afterwards conveyed to New-York. Neither the army nor navy as yet, knew
<PB N="463" REF="472">the circum&s;tances of danger and ruin, in which they had been &s;o nearly involved.</P>
<P>A French fleet of great force had now arrived on the coa&s;t, of which neither the army nor navy had till this time received the &s;malle&s;t notice. This un|expected event filled the minds of all the officers with new apprehen&s;ions, and the dangers which they had lately e&s;caped, appeared &s;mall to tho&s;e which they now apprehended. They had as yet been ma&s;ters of the &s;eas in that quarter, and could move where they plea&s;ed, whenever they were in danger by land; but now two evils &s;tared them in the face, they were obli|ged to change their po&s;ition on the continent for the &s;ake of having free acce&s;s to their &s;hips, but now the fleet it&s;elf was in danger, which greatly increa&s;ed their apprehen&s;ions.</P>
<P>The danger to which our fleet and army were now expo&s;ed, had been fore&s;een and foretold by tho&s;e who were in the oppo&s;ition in parliament, and the &s;ailing of the French fleet under the command of the Count D'E&s;taing had been publi&s;hed long before our mini&s;try had made any provi&s;ion again&s;t its opera|tions. Some warm repre&s;entations had been made concerning the &s;upinene&s;s and negligence of our ad|miralty, in &s;everal &s;peeches in parliament, to which the mini&s;try were unable to reply with any degree of &s;atisfaction to either their friends or enemies. The incapacity of our mini&s;try had as bad an effect upon public affairs, as if they had proceeded with a real intention to ruin the nation, and there were not wanting &s;ome, who both &s;aid as well as thought, that they really intended the events which happened. This latter does not appear to have been the ca&s;e, but the effects of their incapacity were equally fatal
<PB N="464" REF="473">to the public intere&s;t. It was little benefit to the pub|lic to be informed, that they did not act wrong through treachery and de&s;ign, when they did the &s;ame things through incapacity; and would not give up employments and offices, which they could not di&s;|charge with honour to them&s;elves, nor &s;afety to their country.</P>
<P>Information had been received a long time before the &s;ailing of the Toulon fleet, that it was preparing and would be ready to &s;ail in a &s;hort time, yet our ad|miralty di&s;regarded the&s;e notices, and &s;uffered the French &s;quadron, under the Count D'E&s;taing, to pa&s;s the limits of the Mediterranean, and to carry de&s;truc|tion to our fleet and army in North America, and afterwards fire and &s;word to our We&s;t India i&s;lands. It was of &s;mall advantage to the the nation to know, whether the pre&s;ent misfortunes had happened through the treachery or incapacity of the mini&s;try, or from that fatality that had con&s;tantly attended all their mea&s;ures. They had bani&s;hed, by their coun|&s;els, all wi&s;e and hone&s;t men from the pre&s;ence of their &s;overeign, and were now employing him in ho|liday pageants at Spithead, to divert the attention of the people from their immediate danger, whil&s;t our colonies and foreign dependencies were neglected,&mdash; our glory &s;tained,&mdash;and the Briti&s;h flag di&s;graced. The oppo&s;ition in parliament a&s;ked the mini&s;try, and with great propriety, whether it le&s;&s;ened the calami|ties of the nation to know, that the pillaging of their coa&s;ts during the &s;ummer, the alarm and terror into which different parts of the kingdom had been thrown, under the apprehen&s;ion of inva&s;ion, together with the de&s;truction of their commerce, and the lo&s;s of public credit, proceeded merely from the incapa|city
<PB N="465" REF="474">city of the mini&s;ters? Or that the calling out of a mi|litia without arms, and &s;ending them to be encamped without tents or field equipage, &s;prung from the &s;ame cau&s;e? But to which ever cau&s;e the foregoing in|&s;tances may be attributed, no doubt, &s;aid they, can be entertained, that it was the mo&s;t thorough convic|tion of their incapacity, which produced the French re&s;cript, the dangerous mea&s;ure on which it was founded, and the in&s;ult and contumely which the Bri|ti&s;h flag has undergone in the ports of Spain. No|thing le&s;s than &s;uch conviction, could have embolden|ed tho&s;e nations to venture upon &s;uch a conduct, nor could any other po&s;&s;ible direction of the affairs of Great Britain, have drawn upon it &s;uch in&s;ult and in|jury.</P>
<P>They a&s;ked, if any man in his &s;en&s;es could give a vote of credit to a mini&s;try, who were always la&s;t to learn what they &s;hould be fir&s;t to know? Who could be &s;o in&s;en&s;ible of the &s;udden emergencies to which &s;uch a &s;ea&s;on as the pre&s;ent was liable, that when the account arrived of a tran&s;action, which every body expected, and which they &s;hould have long &s;ince guarded again&s;t, only one of them was to be found, and the re&s;t were &s;o di&s;per&s;ed in the cour&s;e of their plea&s;ures, that a &s;ufficient number of them could not be procured, for holding a council, until the hour of debate and determination was lo&s;t. Thus had we lo&s;t that advantage of the wind, which its known and natural cour&s;e in the month of April af|forded; and now &s;ee our fleet embayed at Port&s;|mouth, and likely to continue there, from its having as naturally and regularly taken the oppo&s;ite di|rection.</P>
<PB N="466" REF="475">
<P>Who then, they &s;aid, could tru&s;t &s;uch mini&s;ters! or was it even po&s;&s;ible to e&s;timate their guilt? Was there any thing more wanting, to &s;eal that fatal cha|racter of their admini&s;tration, which carried no other di&s;tinction, than the regular and &s;ucce&s;&s;ive circum|&s;tances of ruin, in which they had involved their country? But it &s;eemed, that the di&s;grace of a Bur|goyne was to be atoned by the de&s;truction of a Howe; and the want of information relative to the union of France and America, to be compen&s;ated by the ignorance of D'E&s;taing's &s;ailing and de&s;tination. A gentleman of di&s;tinction, on that &s;ide, ended his &s;peech with eager exclamation: Whither is the &s;pirit of England fled! Where is the wi&s;dom that u&s;ed to pervade her councils! Where are the terrors gone, with which &s;he was wont to fill the bo&s;oms of tho&s;e who dared to in&s;ult her! Britain, he feared, was be|trayed; treachery and corruption vied with each other, to &s;ee which &s;hould fir&s;t effect her downfall and di&s;grace. The mini&s;ters &s;aid they were confident, that if the gentlemen on the other &s;ide were acquaint|ed with the preparations that had been made, and the effectual care taken to protect this country from inva&s;ion, they would not &s;o ra&s;hly condemn them for treachery; nor charge them &s;o ha&s;tily with incapa|city. The utmo&s;t exertions had been u&s;ed, as well with re&s;pect to the navy, as to every other mode of preparation and defence. And though no fleet had yet &s;ailed to oppo&s;e the Toulon &s;quadron, that was properly to be attributed to the advantage of &s;upply which the French derived from their regi&s;ter, and which at all times enabled them to man out a fleet &s;ooner than we could; but it by no means afforded
<PB N="467" REF="476">any ju&s;t ground for the repeated charges of incapa|city made again&s;t the mini&s;ters. They be&s;ides in&s;i&s;t|ed, that in the pre&s;ent circum&s;tances of danger to which the nation was expo&s;ed, under the immediate threat and apprehen&s;ion of an inva&s;ion, it would have been highly imprudent and unwi&s;e to have weakened the home defence, by any detachment from the Grand Fleet, until &s;uch a force was provided, as would have been adequate to the different &s;ervices. And if it had been otherwi&s;e, and that detachments could have been &s;pared, &s;till they contended, that it would not have been fitting to &s;end out a &s;qua|dron to oppo&s;e D'E&s;taing, without &s;ome clue for its guidance in meeting him, which could not be obtain|ed, until &s;ome light was thrown on his de&s;tination or object. It was hoped, that if D'E&s;taing was bound to North America, Lord Howe would be able to u&s;e &s;uch means of defence, as would prevent any imme|diate con&s;equence of moment; but in the wor&s;t that could happen, Admiral Byron, with the fleet now under his orders at Port&s;mouth, would arrive in time on the coa&s;t, to take full vengeance for any in&s;ult that was offered.</P>
<P>The American mini&s;ter acknowledges, that appear|ances were again&s;t the mini&s;try; but appearances were not to ju&s;tify a condemnation; a full enquiry into the circum&s;tances might place their ca&s;e in a very different light. For his part he was ready to meet every &s;crutiny, and wi&s;hed puni&s;hment to fall where it was de&s;erved. When the di&s;patches arrived, he took the &s;peedie&s;t means to convene the mini&s;ters from the country, where &s;ome of them then were. That from the time of their arrival, the greate&s;t ex|pedition
<PB N="468" REF="477">had been u&s;ed by him, in &s;ending the orders of council to the proper officers at Spithead; but mi&s;|fortunes were not always to be avoided. He hoped, &mdash;he wi&s;hed heartily that our affairs might have a happier turn. The painful pre-eminence of office he &s;aid, was at &s;uch a time, little to be envied: and for his part, if any gentleman of talents, and inclination to &s;erve his country, wi&s;hed to come into his place, he was ready to re&s;ign it. This &s;peech of the mini&s;ter agreed but ill with what had been confidently a&s;&s;ert|ed &s;ome &s;hort time before, concerning the &s;tate of the navy; for if they dur&s;t not venture to &s;end as many &s;hips as were &s;ufficient to prevent the Toulon &s;qua|dron from &s;ailing to America, for fear of an attack upon our own coa&s;t, it was plain that our navy, in the e&s;teem of the mini&s;try them&s;elves, was not fit to combat the fleets of France and Spain. This was an ob&s;ervation that could not e&s;cape the notice of tho&s;e in the minority.</P>
<P>Whatever were the cau&s;es of the mi&s;management at this time, it is manife&s;t that wor&s;e mea&s;ures could not have been pur&s;ued; for had the French fleet not been prevented by &s;torms, more than by the wi&s;dom of the mini&s;try, both our fleet and army had been expo&s;ed to the greate&s;t danger, if not totally de&s;troy|ed. Though the mini&s;try were informed in the month of February, of the number of &s;hips that compo&s;ed the Toulon &s;quadron, of the arrival of Count D'E&s;|taing, and of the day on which he intended to &s;ail; and al&s;o knew that he did &s;ail on the 13th of April, yet our fleet continued lying at Spithead till the latter end of May; nor was a &s;ingle mea&s;ure taken to pre|vent the dreadful effects which were to be expected
<PB N="469" REF="478">from this formidable &s;quadron. The fir&s;t Lord of the Admiralty had, upon the 20th of November, la&s;t year, informed the public, that there were forty two &s;hips of the line fit for &s;ervice, of which thirty-five might put to &s;ea at an hour's warning, and the remaining &s;even would be ready in a fortnight; yet when the &s;ervice of the&s;e &s;hips was required, the fir&s;t Lord of the Admiralty was found not worthy to be depended upon. Though va&s;t &s;ums of money had been grant|ed beyond all example in any former war, yet when there was occa&s;ion for action, our fleets were always in want of &s;ome one thing or other. Sometimes they wanted men, &s;ometimes rigging, at other times &s;mall beer; &s;o that one delay always &s;ucceeded another, when their &s;ervice was required.</P>
<P>Our army had not well arrived at Sandy Hook, when they received the intelligence, from &s;ome of Lord Howe's cruizers, that a new enemy had ap|peared on the coa&s;t of America. Lord Howe had received information on which he could depend, that Count D'E&s;taing was &s;een off the coa&s;t of Virginia, with a fleet of twelve or thirteen &s;ail of the line of battle &s;hips. It was fortunate for our fleet and army that this fleet did not come &s;o far as the Delaware, before our fleet was &s;ailed to New York, otherwi&s;e it might have been in the power of D'E&s;taing to have de&s;troyed the whole; or had he met the tran&s;ports in their pa&s;&s;age as they were encumbred, and only under the convoy of two &s;hips of he line and &s;ome frigates, the con&s;equence is obvious. The &s;tate of the army, as well as that of the fleet, would have been deplorable, and the lo&s;s of the latter would have i&s;&s;ued in the lo&s;s of the former; for as the army
<PB N="470" REF="479">could not then, by any po&s;&s;ible means, have pur|&s;ued its way to New York, and would have been enclo&s;ed on the one &s;ide by the American army, and on the other by the French fleet, cut off from all &s;up|ply and provi&s;ion, and de&s;titute of every re&s;ource, the con&s;equence mu&s;t have been, that they mu&s;t have either all peri&s;hed, or have &s;urrendered as General Burgoyne did at Saratoga. The badne&s;s of the wea|ther, more than the wi&s;dom of our mini&s;try, &s;aved our army and fleet; for by various &s;torms Count D'E&s;taing was &s;o interrupted in his voyage, that he did not ar|rive &s;o &s;oon as he might have done, provided the weather had continued favourable and the wind fair. And after all his interruptions, had he directed his cour&s;e directly to New York in&s;tead of Che&s;apeak Bay, the con&s;equence to our fleet and army would have been much the &s;ame; for he would have come upon both in a &s;hattered condition, entangled with laying, or pa&s;&s;ing the bridge at Sandy Hook. In either of which circum&s;tances, de&s;truction mu&s;t have been the con&s;equence, and the event of &s;uch a na|ture and magnitude, as had not been experienced in any late ages. To Britain it mu&s;t have been fatal, as her army, upon which &s;he had &s;pent immen&s;e &s;ums, and her fleet, upon which &s;he depended for the pre|&s;ervation of her we&s;tern dominion, would have been no more. But the principal object D'E&s;taing had in view, was to &s;urprize our fleet in the Delaware, and to enclo&s;e our army in Philadelphia; whereby he ima|gined he would gain the &s;ame point, which, if he had known, and pur&s;ued his cour&s;e, he might have more effectually gained by &s;ailing to New York. A more
<PB N="471" REF="480">remarkable and &s;ignal e&s;cape and deliverance is not ea&s;y to be pointed out.</P>
<P>Though the degree of the danger was le&s;&s;ened by the favour of providence, it was not immediately al|together removed. A heavy cloud as yet hung over both the fleet and army, and how it would bur&s;t and di&s;pel, was as yet altogether uncertain. It required great foreca&s;t to perceive in what manner the French would proceed, or to under&s;tand whether it was po&s;|&s;ible for them to effect with their great &s;hips, what only could be ruinous to our fleet. Upon the fourth day after the account was received of his arrival on the coa&s;t, and &s;ub&s;equent advice of his having anchor|ed at the Delaware, D'E&s;taing appeared &s;uddenly and unexpectedly in &s;ight of the Briti&s;h fleet at Sandy-Hook. He had a great force, and as yet in good condition, con&s;i&s;ting of twelve &s;hips of the line and three frigates of &s;uperior &s;ize. Among the fir&s;t there were &s;ome &s;hips of great force and weight of metal; one carrying 90, another 80, and &s;ix carrying 74 guns each; and the &s;puadron was &s;aid to have eleven i|&s;and men on board. On the other &s;ide the Briti&s;h fleet under Lord Howe, con&s;i&s;ted of &s;ix 64 gun &s;hips, three of 50, and two of forty guns, with &s;ome fri|gates and &s;loops. Mo&s;t of the line of battle &s;hips be|longing to Lord Howe had been long at &s;ea, and were on that account in a very indifferent condition, and were wretchedly manned. The principal ba|lance to the&s;e di&s;advantages, and which was the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential remedy for the &s;everal other evils that were attendant on our fleet, was the &s;uperior abilities of their commander, and the excellency of their other officers. It would be difficult to find in all Europe, either &s;uch another &s;ea-officer as Lord Howe, or &s;uch
<PB N="472" REF="481">a&s;&s;istants as tho&s;e inferior officers that were under him. He had a con&s;ummate knowledge in naval atchieve|ments, and under&s;tood almo&s;t every po&s;&s;ible circum|&s;tance that might happen in &s;uch a critical &s;ituation. He provided again&s;t all the evils that might happen, as much as his circum&s;tances and the force under his command would permit. His preparations were ma&s;terly and judicious, and his &s;ucce&s;s in the end, an&s;werable to the wi&s;dom of his conduct. There was one thing much in favour of Lord Howe: He was in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Sandy Hook and the harbour, the en|trance of which is covered by a bar, and from whence the inlet pa&s;&s;es to New-York. To force this pa&s;&s;age was not an ea&s;y ta&s;k, though it is believed that D'Estaing intended to make the grand attack at this point, force the pa&s;&s;age, and attack the Engli&s;h fleet in the harbour. Had this been &s;peedily executed, the ruin of our fleet would have been inevitable; for tho' Lord Howe had made every po&s;&s;ible preparation for defence that the time would admit of, yet from the wind's blowing contrary, and many other unavoid|able accidents, the &s;hips were not arrived in their re&s;pective &s;tations, and &s;ituations of defence; nor had there as yet been time to choo&s;e tho&s;e &s;ituations with that judgment, which was afterwards exerci&s;ed when the French fleet appeared without Sandy Hook. In the&s;e circum&s;tances, had D'E&s;taing pu&s;hed the ad|vantages ari&s;ing from the &s;urprize, and pa&s;&s;ed the bar directly, and made his attack, neither the advantages of &s;ituation nor any eminence of ability or valour on the one &s;ide, could have been &s;ufficient to have coun|teracted the va&s;t &s;uperiority of force on the other. The engagement would have undoubtedly been dreadful, and probably in that re&s;pect, might have
<PB N="473" REF="482">been a &s;ingular phaenomenon, unknown in naval hi&s;|tory; but the greate&s;t degree of human valour mu&s;t require a proportional degree of &s;trength, to render its operations of effectual.</P>
<P>It has been di&s;puted, whether or not it was prac|ticable for the large ve&s;&s;els, under the command of D'E&s;taing to pa&s;s through the &s;traits and over the bar. Some are of opinion that this might have been done, and performed with prudence. Others affirm that it was altogether impracticable, and could not be done without expo&s;ing the large &s;hips to certain ruin and de&s;truction. If this latter was the ca&s;e, it would ap|pear that our fleet, after it came within the Hook, was not in &s;o great a danger as has been repre&s;ented. But if the other opinion be true, it mu&s;t be allowed, that the irre&s;olution or want of knowledge of the French admiral, were the principal things that &s;aved the fleet and army. Had this French commander been po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;uch a &s;pirit of enterprize as to have made this attempt, and &s;ucceeded, Great Britain would have received &s;uch a blow as &s;he had not expe|rienced for &s;ome ages pa&s;t. Lord Howe had no force &s;ufficient to combat &s;uch &s;uperiority of men and metal, and no timely provi&s;ion had been made for his a&s;&s;i&s;tance by the government at home. It was for this rea&s;on, affirmed by &s;ome, that the mini&s;try in|tended to make a &s;acrifice of this noble commander, to their party pique and political revenge. What|ever may have been the real cau&s;e of their conduct, there was &s;ufficient rea&s;ons to draw &s;uch inferences there from.</P>
<P>There was a wonderful zeal prevailed at this time in the fleet and army, to give the French a warm re|ception.
<PB N="474" REF="483">All ranks and degrees endeavoured to excel one another in readine&s;s to a&s;&s;i&s;t in all enter|prizes nece&s;&s;ary for making a noble re&s;i&s;tance. A thou&s;and volunteers were immediately di&s;patched from the tran&s;ports to the fleet. The remainder of the crews could not re&s;train their indignation, at be|ing left behind, and u&s;ed every po&s;&s;ible mean, by hi|ding them&s;elves in the boats, to e&s;cape aboard the men of war; &s;o that the agents could, it is &s;aid, &s;carcely keep by force as many hands as were &s;uffi|cient to keep watch in their re&s;pective &s;hips. The ma&s;ters and mates of the merchantmen and traders at New York, &s;olicited employment with great earne&s;t|ne&s;s, and took their &s;tations at the guns, with the common &s;ailors. Others hazarded every thing, by putting to &s;ea in light ve&s;&s;els, to watch the motions of the enemy, and perform other nece&s;&s;ary &s;ervices.</P>
<P>One man in particular, with an uncommon di&s;inter|e&s;tedne&s;s and gallantry, went beyond any thing almo&s;t recorded in hi&s;tory; he offered to convert his ve&s;&s;el, in which his whole hope and fortune lay, into a fire-&s;hip, to be conducted by him&s;elf, and refu&s;ed with &s;corn, every propo&s;al of indemnification or reward. It is a great pity to employ Briti&s;h &s;ailors in any cause except what has a true moral ba&s;is, and which may be vindicated upon the pure&s;t principles of truth; for as they are not ready to enquire into the rea&s;ons or cau&s;es for which they are led on to action, it is cruel to mi&s;lead them. When danger is in view they di&s;regard it, and court enterprize with an uncommon zeal, without ever enquiring concerning either the principles or end of their proceeding. Tho' many of them are pre&s;&s;ed into the &s;ervice again&s;t their will,
<PB N="475" REF="484">yet when once they are under command, they will fight as they are ordered without &s;o much as thinking about the cau&s;es or rea&s;ons of the war.</P>
<P>This fit of military enthu&s;ia&s;m &s;pread through all branches of the war department, and the &s;oldiers emulated the &s;ailors in de&s;ire to be led on to action. The light infantry and grenadiers, who were not well recovered from their wounds and fatigue, con|tended with &s;uch eagerne&s;s to &s;erve on board the men of war as marines, that the point of honour was obliged to be decided by lots. The bravery and magnanimity di&s;played on this occa&s;ion, de&s;cribed the national character of both men and officers, and does great honour to their country. Two things at this time contributed much to this readine&s;s for enter|prize in both the navy and army: The fir&s;t was, the popularity of the noble commander, and the confi|dence founded on his great abilities; and the &s;econd was, that antipathy which generally prevails in the minds of Briti&s;h &s;oldiers and &s;ailors, again&s;t the French, who now, as they thought, had unju&s;tly in|terfered in the pre&s;ent war. As to the principles or rea&s;ons of the war, the greate&s;t part, as is always the ca&s;e, had never in the lea&s;t con&s;idered them: the go|vernment had &s;ettled that point, and they accounted it their bu&s;ine&s;s to obey. The officers in general, like other &s;oldiers of fortune, were only fighting for them&s;elves, with a view to preferment; and their eagerne&s;s for action proceeded more from a de&s;ire of &s;ignalizing them&s;elves as &s;oldiers of the mini&s;try, to obtain in their turn an exaltation of place and emo|lument, than from any ideas they had of the morality of the war, or its political utility,</P>
<PB N="476" REF="485">
<P>The French fleet continued at anchor, in the &s;itua|tion already mentioned, taking in water and provi&s;ion for eleven days. D'E&s;taing knew well that as he had not profited of the fir&s;t opportunity that was pre|&s;ented to him, that any attempt made by his fleet, after all the preparations on the other &s;ide had been compleated, and the judicious po&s;itions of the Briti&s;h admiral were fully fini&s;hed, would have been ineffec|tual and hazardous, and perhaps ruinous to his fleet; he therefore de&s;i&s;ted from the attempt. The Briti&s;h &s;eamen were now under great agitations: the mixed pa&s;&s;ions of grief and indignation wrought wonderfully in their minds, and appeared manife&s;tly in their coun|tenances. They now &s;aw them&s;elves &s;hut up by a French fleet, and endured the mortification of &s;eeing a Briti&s;h &s;quadron in&s;ulted in their own harbour, and the French flag flying in triumph without. What greatly added to their chagrin was, that they beheld every day ve&s;&s;els under Engli&s;h colours, who were ignorant of the &s;ituation of affairs at Sandy Hook, taken under their eye by the enemy. They looked out every hour with the utmo&s;t anxiety, and in the mo&s;t eager expectation for the arrival of Byron's &s;quadron. This was an unu&s;ual &s;ituation to a Briti&s;h &s;quadron, and not ea&s;ily endured by officers and men, who had been accu&s;tomed to triumph &s;o frequently, over the French fleets, wherever they met them. We may ea&s;ily conceive that it would rai&s;e &s;evere &s;en&s;ations in the brea&s;ts of the Briti&s;h &s;eamen, to be cooped up in a harbour, only to be witne&s;&s;es of the capture of the &s;hips of their own nation, and to bear the in&s;ults of the French fleet, riding triumphant be|fore
<PB N="477" REF="486">their port, without daring to go out to attack them.</P>
<P>On the 22d of July D'E&s;taing's fleet appeared under way, and as the wind was favourable and the &s;pring tides at the highe&s;t, the water having ri&s;en that afternoon thirty feet on the bar, it was expected that he intended to carry his threatening into execution, and to try the experiment of pa&s;&s;ing the bar to attack our fleet in the harbour; and that, that day would have afforded one of the hotte&s;t engagements, and the mo&s;t de&s;perate action that had ever been fought between the two rival nations. Every thing was at &s;take on the &s;ide of Britain. If the naval force was de&s;troyed, the va&s;t fleets of tran&s;ports and victuallers, with the army, mu&s;t have fallen along with it; for the conflict could not have ended without victory or ruin. The French admiral con&s;idered the attempt to be too dangerous, and de&s;i&s;ted from this undertaking. He directed his cour&s;e another way, and was out of &s;ight in a few hours.</P>
<P>It was a happy circum&s;tance for Britain, that the French admiral went off at this time: His &s;tay at Sandy Hook was extremely critical, and nothing could have been more fortunate than his departure at the very time he went away. For if Admiral Byron's fleet had arrived in the &s;hattered condition in which it at la&s;t arrived at New York, it mu&s;t have fallen a defenceless prey into the hands of D'E&s;taing's &s;qua|dron, which would have been a lo&s;s mo&s;t &s;everely felt. Byron's &s;quadron is &s;aid to have been in many re&s;pects badly equipped and provided; and in this feeble &s;ituation it had the misfortune of meeting with unu&s;ual &s;tormy weather for the &s;ea&s;on; and being &s;e|parated
<PB N="478" REF="487">in different &s;torms, and lingering through a tedious pa&s;&s;age, arrived &s;cattered, broken, &s;ickly, di&s;ma&s;ted, or otherwi&s;e damaged, in various degrees of di&s;tre&s;s, upon different and remote parts of the coa&s;t of America. Providence, though it had not favoured our &s;quadron with an agreeable pa&s;&s;age, had compen&s;ated the danger it was in, by pre&s;erving it from the hands of our enemies; and though the lo&s;s by the &s;torm was con&s;iderable, yet none of the fleet had as yet fallen into the hands of the French, which afforded this &s;atisfaction, that the enemy had not been &s;trengthened by our lo&s;s on this occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>Lord Howe was &s;till in an unea&s;y &s;ituation: His fleet was not &s;ufficiently powerful to re&s;i&s;t that of D'E&s;taing in the open &s;ea, and he had the mortifica|tion to find him&s;elf &s;till in jeopardy, &s;hould the French fleet return, before he was favoured with a reinforce|ment. It was, however, a fortunate circum&s;tance, that on the 30th of July, the Renown of 50 guns from the We&s;t Indies, the Raisonable and Centurion of 64 and 50, from Halifax, and the Cornwall, a 74 gun &s;hip, of Admiral Byron's &s;quadron, all arrived &s;ingly at Sandy Hook. It is ea&s;y to conceive what an agreeable &s;ight this was, both to the army and navy, who were in an unea&s;y &s;u&s;pence, both with regard to the intentions of the French &s;quadron, and what was be&s;t to be done on that occa&s;ion. Though our fleet was &s;till inferior to that of the French, yet it was a for|tunate circum&s;tance that the Cornwall was in better condition than any of the re&s;t of the fleet, becau&s;e Lord Howe had no &s;hips of equal force, to combat the large ve&s;&s;els of the fleet of D'E&s;taing. This cir|cum&s;tance of the arrival of &s;o many &s;hips, rai&s;ed the
<PB N="479" REF="488">&s;pirits of our men, and rendered them all eager for fighting; but the project of the French Admiral was as yet a &s;ecret, and our force was &s;till too much in|ferior to ri&s;que a battle in the open &s;ea. By what means this &s;cheme of the French failed is as yet a &s;e|cret: It would appear that the mini&s;try of France, in concert with the commi&s;&s;ioners from the colonies, had formed a very rational plan of operation, which could not have mi&s;&s;ed of its intended effect, under the ma|nagement of a &s;kilful and intrepid commander. D'E&s;taing appears to have mi&s;managed the execution of this plan, for want of judgment, and not for want of courage. The &s;everal &s;teps which he took upon this occa&s;ion were erroneous, and his conduct was fraught with folly and incapacity. Had he pu&s;hed on his mea&s;ures with vigour, as &s;oon as he approached, he could not have failed of &s;ucce&s;s, but his lingering without the bar for &s;o long a time, was exceedingly imprudent, and void of wi&s;dom.</P>
<P>The failure of this excellently contrived &s;cheme, which had been founded in great wi&s;dom, by the French mini&s;try, and the American deputies, at Paris, for the &s;urprize of the Briti&s;h fleet and army, either on the Delaware or its borders, obliged the com|mander to take new mea&s;ures. He now fixed upon Rhode I&s;land, as a place that would admit the mutual and joint operation of his new allies by &s;ea and land. This &s;eems to have been the motive which determined D'E&s;taing to depart from Sandy Hook; and for this purpo&s;e General Sullivan a&s;&s;embled a number of troops in the neighbourhood of Providence, for an inva&s;ion of the i&s;land on its north end, from the con|tinent; whil&s;t D'E&s;taing was to enter the harbour of
<PB N="480" REF="489">Newport near its &s;outhern extremity, and after de|&s;troying the &s;hipping, by a powerful a&s;&s;ault on the works facing the &s;ea, to place the Briti&s;h forces be|tween two fires. On the 25th of July the French fleet blocked up, or entered the &s;everal inlets, between which Rhode I&s;land, and its adjoining le&s;&s;er i&s;lands, are enclo&s;ed, and which form a communication, more or le&s;s navigable in the different branches, between the open &s;ea and the back continent. The main body ca&s;t anchor without Brenton's Lodge, about five miles from Newport; two of their line of battle &s;hips ran up to the Naragan&s;et pa&s;&s;age and anchored off the north end of the i&s;land of Conanicut, where they were &s;hut up &s;everal days from rejoining the fleet, by contrary winds; while &s;ome of their frigates, entering the Seconnet pa&s;&s;age, occa&s;ioned the blow|ing up the King-Fi&s;her &s;loop and two armed gallies, which could not otherwi&s;e avoid falling into the hands of their enemy.</P>
<P>Major-General Sir Robert Pigot, who commanded the Briti&s;h forces, took every mea&s;ure in the power of a brave and experienced officer, that could tend to vigorous and mo&s;t ob&s;tinate defence. The troops, artillery, and cattle, were immediately conveyed from the i&s;land of Conanicut; the troops at the out-po&s;ts of Rhode-I&s;land were in con&s;tant readine&s;s, at the fir&s;t &s;ignal, to join the main body; the works to the &s;ea were &s;trengthened by every po&s;&s;ible mean, and the &s;eamen belonging to the ve&s;&s;els that were de&s;troy|ed, as well as tho&s;e that could be &s;pared from others, were called to their favourite occupation, by &s;erving the artillery.</P>

<P>The tran&s;ports (which mu&s;t otherwi&s;e have fallen into the enemy's hands) were &s;unk in different parts of tho&s;e channels and pa&s;&s;ages, which might have afforded them an opportunity of attacking the works with advantage. The royal frigates were removed as far from danger as po&s;&s;ible; but as their lo&s;s and de&s;truction were inevitable, in the pro&s;ecution of the enemy's de&s;ign, they were di&s;mantled of their artil|lery and &s;tores, and the nece&s;&s;ary mea&s;ures taken for &s;ecuring the latter part of the alternative. Two op|po&s;ite bays, in the inlets on the ea&s;tern and we&s;tern &s;ides of the i&s;land, compre&s;s it &s;o much, as to form a kind of i&s;thmus, by which the &s;outhern end, that &s;preads into the ocean, is connected with the main body. The town of Newport is ju&s;t within this penin&s;ula, and facing the i&s;land of Conanicut; the &s;pace between both forming a bay, which includes or forms the harbour. The inlet to the harbour from the &s;ea, called the Middle Channel, is narrow, and enclo&s;ed by Brenton's Point, and the oppo&s;ite point of Conanicut, which forms the &s;outhern extremities of both i&s;lands. A bar of high grounds, which cro&s;|&s;es the i&s;thmus from channel to channel above New|port, was &s;trongly covered with lines, redoubts, and artillery; &s;o that the penin&s;ula might be con&s;idered as a garri&s;on, di&s;tinct from the re&s;t of the i&s;land, and under the protection of a &s;uperior naval force, might in a great mea&s;ure defy any attempts from the north|ern &s;ide, &s;uppo&s;ing that an enemy had made good its landing in &s;uch circum&s;tances. But the enemy being ma&s;ters of the &s;ea, rendered the ta&s;k of defence, under the apprehen&s;ion of an attack on both &s;ides at the &s;ame time, exceedingly arduous. The commander had however, ju&s;t before, received a reinforcement
<PB N="482" REF="492">of five battalions; the troops were in excellent con|dition and &s;pirit; and the body of &s;eamen, both with re&s;pect to labour and danger, were no &s;mall addition to their means of re&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>The force de&s;tined again&s;t them by land, was not &s;o con&s;iderable as their information had led them to apprehend. The bu&s;ine&s;s on that &s;ide, &s;eems to have been committed mo&s;tly, if not entirely, to the north|ern colonies, who were tho&s;e immediately concerned in the event. General Sullivan is, however, &s;aid to have a&s;&s;embled about 10,000 men, of whom, at lea&s;t, half were compo&s;ed of volunteers from New England and Connecticut. As the operations of the French fleet were regulated by tho&s;e of the army on the land, they continued inactive, until Sullivan was in condi|tion to pa&s;s over from the continent to the north end of the i&s;land. On the 8th of Augu&s;t, finding that mea&s;ure in forwardne&s;s, and the wind being favour|able, they entered the harbour under an ea&s;y &s;ail, cannonading the town and batteries as they pa&s;&s;ed, receiving their fire without any material effect on either &s;ide. They anchored above the town, be|tween Goat-I&s;land and Conanicut, but rather nearer to the latter, on which both the French and Ame|ricans had parties for &s;ome days. When it was di&s;|covered that the enemy intended to enter the har|bour, our commanders were thrown into the utmo&s;t confu&s;ion: They found it out of their power to pre|&s;erve his maje&s;ty's &s;hips that were in that &s;tation, and it was a great mortification to &s;et fire to ve&s;&s;els that were &s;o nece&s;&s;ary in tho&s;e parts, and of which they were likely to be in &s;o much need, for the purpo&s;es of war, and &s;afety to them&s;elves and the land forces. They were, however, obliged to make a virtue of
<PB N="483" REF="493">nece&s;&s;ity, and to burn the Orpheus, Lark, Juno, and Cerberus frigates, and &s;oon after to &s;ink the Flora and Falcon. Our people were now obliged to pur|&s;ue the mea&s;ures which they had boa&s;ted they had driven the coloni&s;ts to ob&s;erve, and they found at this time the poignant influence of that reflection, do as you would be done by. Some of the&s;e officers and their crews had been engaged in burning expeditions in &s;everal parts of the coa&s;ts of America; but the &s;weetne&s;s of the application was now brought home to them&s;elves, and they began to feel the full force of their own practice, turned again&s;t them, aggrava|ted with the grievous reflection, that they now &s;uf|fered no more than they well de&s;erved. The lo&s;s of the&s;e frigates were at home con&s;idered as only a tri|fling matter, and the mini&s;try and their friends, affect|ed to bear it in a very &s;toical manner. It was at the &s;ame time &s;ufficiently manife&s;t that they felt &s;everely the pre&s;ent di&s;a&s;ter, though they &s;poke lightly there|of, and wanted to have it otherwi&s;e believed. When Lord Howe received the news of the danger Rhode-I&s;land was in, from the French fleet and the Ame|rican troops, he was much perplexed what mea&s;ures to take. His &s;quadron, notwith&s;tanding the late re|inforcements, was in many re&s;pects inferior to that of D'E&s;taing. The difference in point of number of &s;hips was little, but there was a great difference with re&s;pect to the number of men and the weight of me|tal. It was dangerous to hazard an engagement in the&s;e circum&s;tances, and without doing it, there was no hope of &s;aving the i&s;land. The admiral was, how|ever, determined to attempt every thing which re|&s;olution, under the government of rea&s;on and wi&s;e conduct, could effect; and though the ca&s;e was dif|ficult
<PB N="484" REF="494">and hazardous, he did not de&s;pair of giving &s;uch relief to the i&s;land, as would at lea&s;t, render it an ar|duous enterprize for the French to carry their de&s;igns into execution. He &s;tudied all the collateral advan|tages that might be obtained to render his &s;ucce&s;s probable, and endeavoured to balance the &s;uperio|rity of the enemy with &s;uperior &s;kill and activity. He was indeed &s;uperior, in point of number of &s;hips, to the French admiral, for his &s;quadron now con&s;i&s;ted of one 74, &s;even 64, and five 50 gun &s;hips, be&s;ides &s;eve|ral frigates; but the difference, in other re&s;pects, was manife&s;t from the rates of the &s;hips, the number of men, and the weight of metal. But every experiment that had the &s;malle&s;t degree of probability of &s;ucce&s;s on its &s;ide, was now to be tried, and he was deter|mined that nothing &s;hould be neglected that was in his power to perform. The narrows, in which the French &s;quadron was now involved, gave &s;ome turns of advantage, and the ignorance of the French ma|riners, with regard to the inlets and pa&s;&s;ages, afford|ed &s;till a &s;tronger evpectation that the large &s;hips might be entangled in &s;uch a manner as not to be of greater &s;ervice than lighter ve&s;&s;els. Lord Howe had received advice that the French &s;quadron were &s;epa|rated, and &s;ome of them involved in the channel, and the bulk of them lying without, afforded &s;ome rea&s;on to hope that he might bring on an engagement upon more equal terms than could have been expected.</P>
<P>In the mid&s;t of all the preparations and eagerne&s;s for action, there were &s;everal unavoidable interrup|tions which came in the way, that he could not reach Rhode I&s;land till the month of Augu&s;t, the day after the French fleet had entered the harbour. From the &s;ituation in which the French fleet now lay, he was
<PB N="485" REF="495">enabled to keep a communication with General Pigot; but this was but indifferent con&s;olation, as the re&s;ult was, that under the pre&s;ent circum&s;tance, the afford|ing him any e&s;&s;ential relief was wholly impracticable. Information of this &s;ort was really wor&s;e than none at all, for it was ready to di&s;pirit the men upon land, and gave them rea&s;on to conjecture that matters were really wor&s;e than they were. It mu&s;t be allowed that the &s;ituation of both our fleet and army was &s;till ex|ceedingly critical, and the wi&s;e&s;t officers among&s;t them could but promi&s;e little upon the head of any effort that they &s;hould make on this occa&s;ion. The circum&s;tances of both parties were &s;uddenly altered by the change of the wind to the north ea&s;t, upon the following day, when the French admiral &s;tood out to &s;ea with his whole fleet, tho&s;e in the pa&s;&s;age of Naragan&s;et as well as tho&s;e in the port. Lord Howe very ju&s;tly con&s;idered the weather gage too great an advantage to be added to the &s;uperior force of the enemy, and contended for that object with all the &s;kill and judgment worthy of an able and experienced &s;ea officer. The French admiral, not with&s;tanding the &s;uperiority of his force, was as earne&s;t to pre&s;erve this advantage, as the Engli&s;h was to gain it. This trial of &s;kill in &s;ea operations prevented an engage|ment for all that day, but the wind on the following day continuing adver&s;e to the de&s;igns of Lord Howe, he determined to make the be&s;t of the pre&s;ent cir|cum&s;tances, and to engage the enemy; forming the line in &s;uch a manner as to be joined by three fire-&s;hips, which were under the tow of as many frigates. All the preparations for this re&s;o|lute engagement, and the whole de&s;ign, were fru&s;trated by a violent &s;torm that now aro&s;e: which
<PB N="486" REF="496">made the warriors glad to lay a&s;ide the thoughts of a battle for the pre&s;ent, and apply their utmo&s;t care and diligence to pre&s;erve them&s;elves and their &s;hips from being &s;wallowed up in the mid&s;t of the tempe&s;tuous billows. A &s;trong gale of wind, which gradually in|crea&s;ed to a tempe&s;t, and continued for forty-eight hours, not only put off the engagement by &s;eparating the fleets, for the pre&s;ent, but &s;hattered them in &s;uch a manner, and cau&s;ed &s;o much damage on both &s;ides, as rendered an engagement, for &s;ome time, imprac|ticable. Some people of a particular way of thinking, were ready to ob&s;erve, that the providence which rai&s;ed this &s;torm, was more favourable to our fleet, than the merits of the cau&s;e it was engaged in de&s;erv|ed, and that Lord Howe, who in his own heart did not approve of the war, but was merely influenced by a point of honour, ought to have acknowledged the hand of providence, and given up the pur&s;uit of a cau&s;e which his con&s;cience di&s;approved. It is mo&s;t probable, had an engagement happened. that our fleet mu&s;t have &s;uffered a defeat, which would have been of direful con&s;equence to the army, and al&s;o to the whole nation. The &s;torm was one of tho&s;e acci|dents, that was violent in the operation, but &s;alutary in its effects, and in all appearance was the in&s;trument of &s;aving our fleet.</P>
<P>Both fleets &s;uffered greatly in this tempe&s;t; the French felt it &s;everely, having two of their capital &s;hips di&s;ma&s;ted, and others much &s;hattered. We are informed, by our accounts of this tempe&s;t, that &s;ome untoward &s;ituations, and unu&s;ual circum&s;tances were produced by this conflict of the elements. That the Languedoc of 90 guns, the French admiral's own &s;hip, had lo&s;t her ma&s;ts, and was met in that condition
<PB N="487" REF="497">by the Renown, Captain Daw&s;on, on the evening of the 13th, who attacked her with &s;uch fury, as well as judgment and advantage, that no doubt could have been entertained of the event if the day-light had continued: But the darkne&s;s of the night, and fre&s;h|ne&s;s of the gale, who&s;e violence was not yet cea&s;ed, compelled Capt. Daw&s;on to give over the attack, after he had poured &s;everal broad&s;ides into her, and had, be&s;ides other apparent damage, &s;hot away her rudder. He is, however, &s;aid to have laid to, all the night, as clo&s;ely as po&s;&s;ible, with an intention to renew the attack in the morning; but the appearance of &s;ix French men of war, by whom he was chaced at day-light, and who were &s;uppo&s;ed to be led that way by the noi&s;e of the firing, put an end to Daw&s;on's hope, and relieved the French admiral from his urgent di&s;tre&s;s. This matter is differently related by &s;ome who pretend to know this affair. The Renown was &s;everely handled by this di&s;ma&s;ted French ve&s;&s;el, and received &s;o much damage from her heavy metal, that it was with difficulty &s;he made her e&s;cape; and that, though &s;he had continued her operation, it would have been doubtful whether &s;he might not have been &s;ent to the bottom. That the re&s;olution to make her e&s;|cape, proceeded as much from her pre&s;ent di&s;tre&s;s, as from the fear of the approaching &s;hips. She howe|ver fortunately got clear, without her prize, and with &s;ome degree of gladne&s;s that &s;he was not made a prize her&s;elf. It is very remarkable that the &s;ame good and evil fortune happened to the Pre&s;ton, Com|modore Hotham, another 50 gun &s;hip, which fell in with the Tonnant, a French 80 gun &s;hip, which &s;he would have taken, provided fortune and power had favoured her de&s;ign. The French &s;hip had only her
<PB N="488" REF="498">main-ma&s;t &s;tanding, and the Commodore attacked her bri&s;kly, with the &s;ame &s;pirit and effect with which Capt. Daw&s;on had engaged the Languedoc. But the night again came on, and the next morning brought the French fleet to a&s;&s;i&s;t the Tonnant, and di&s;appoint the Commodore, as had happened to the Renown before. That two &s;uch remarkable ca&s;es might happen, &s;o exactly like one another, is not im|po&s;&s;ible, though the probability thereof is not &s;o very manife&s;t; and con&s;idering how ready our Engli&s;h &s;ea|men are to magnify their own valour, and di&s;credit that of the French, it affords rather, ground to be|lieve that there is &s;omewhat of hyperbole in the hi&s;|tory of this affair. Not only the French, but &s;ome of our own men who were concerned in the action, have &s;aid that it was neither in the power of the Re|nown nor the Pre&s;ton, to have taken the &s;hips they were engaged with, and that, after the engage|ment, they were glad to get off with the lo&s;s they them&s;elves had &s;u&s;tained. It was certainly brave in Captain Daw&s;on and Commodore Hotham, to give &s;ome broad&s;ides to two large &s;hips in di&s;tre&s;s; but as they them&s;elves had &s;hared of the &s;torm, and met with their own misfortunes, it is not very probable that they were able to take two &s;uch great &s;hips, with &s;o large a number of men on board, and carrying &s;uch &s;uperior metal. It was happy that they e&s;caped, after having &s;hewn their intrepidity for the honour of the Briti&s;h flag.</P>
<P>The &s;tories that are told concerning the acts of prowe&s;s on this occa&s;ion, which were introduced by means of this tempe&s;t, have much the appearance of &s;ome of the epi&s;odes which Homer introduces concern|ing the Trojan war, where &s;ome mo&s;t de&s;perate en|gagements
<PB N="489" REF="499">wore fought between particular heroes, where|in both e&s;caped, after having done all that brave men could do, by the favour of &s;ome interpo&s;ition of providence, which &s;natched the victory out of the hands of tho&s;e who were ju&s;t upon the point of con|quering.</P>
<P>Advantages did not wholly attend one &s;ide during this tempe&s;t; both &s;ides had their turns of pro&s;pect of advantage with &s;imilar di&s;appointments. The I&s;is of 50 guns, Capt. Raynor, was eagerly chaced by a French 74 gun &s;hip, &s;uppo&s;ed either to have been the Zele or Cae&s;ar. The French &s;hip was much the bet|ter &s;ailor, and the &s;ituation, with re&s;pect to the &s;torm, was the &s;ame, they having both e&s;caped the effects of its fury. In this unequal conte&s;t, in which the great|e&s;t re&s;olution and &s;kill is &s;aid to have been di&s;played, a clo&s;e and de&s;perate engagement was maintained with the greate&s;t ob&s;tinacy on both &s;ides, for an hour and a half, and within the di&s;tance of pi&s;tol-&s;hot. At the end of that time the I&s;is had obtained &s;o ma|nife&s;t a &s;uperiority in the action, that the French &s;hip was glad to put before the wind, and call in the aid of all her &s;ails to e&s;cape from &s;o determined an enemy. The I&s;is had &s;uffered &s;o much in her ma&s;ts and rigging as to be incapable of attempting a pur|&s;uit. The hi&s;tory of this action given in our papers, has more the appearance of <HI>a novel,</HI> than of an im|partial account of matters of fact. The &s;tories are &s;o ingeniou&s;ly introduced, the valour of par|ties di&s;played in a certain light, and after each &s;ide has acted the part a&s;&s;igned them, either &s;ome fre&s;h gale of wind, or &s;ails, are called in to the &s;ave the one and di&s;appoint the other of victory. The
<PB N="490" REF="500">accounts of this &s;torm, and the &s;everal incidental en|gagements which happened on this occa&s;ion, may in &s;ome di&s;tant period afford a foundation for a tolerable epic poem, which may equal, if not exceed, the wars of Troy, and hand own the atchievements of the Engli&s;h and the French at Rhode-I&s;land, to future ge|nerations.</P>
<P>Our hi&s;torians affirm that it is not ea&s;y to deter|mine whether to admire more the gallantry exhibited in this &s;ingular action, or the mode&s;ty of the brave commander, in his account of it. This was indeed &s;o extreme, that his admiral was obliged in &s;ome degree to &s;upply the defect, by acquainting the admiralty, that the honour of the day was not more owing to the re&s;olution of the captain, or the intrepidity of his officers and crew, than to the profe&s;&s;ional &s;kill and ability of the former. Without derogating from the &s;kill or intrepidity of Capt. Raynor, it is plain that there was more of nece&s;&s;ity than choice, in this en|gagement with this French &s;hip; and that whatever advantage he had gained, it did not amount to any more than &s;aving his own &s;hip, as the French ve&s;&s;el continued to have the u&s;e of ma&s;ts and rigging, of which the I&s;is was deprived. Neither does it appear, whether it was the &s;torm that &s;eparated them, or that it was a matter of choice in the Frenchman to get off.</P>
<P>There is no manner of doubt but that the Engli&s;h fleet behaved well, and the honour and bravery of the Briti&s;h commanders and &s;ailors might have been fully repre&s;ented, without warping in &s;o much of the marvelous, as to give impartial enquirers rea&s;on to call in que&s;tion the truth of the hi&s;tory. There was
<PB N="491" REF="501">nothing which happened, but what might have been expected from the abilities of Lord. Howe and the officers that were under his command; but tho&s;e cir|cum&s;tantial accounts of the battle in the &s;torm, appear rather &s;omewhat romantic to be admitted into hi&s;tory without &s;ome grains of allowance. Our partiality for our countrymen ought not to lead us to embelli&s;h matters &s;o much, as to exceed tho&s;e rules of proba|bility which the nature of things admits of; for in exaggerating too much, particular circum&s;tances, the truth of hi&s;tory is liable to be &s;u&s;pected. There are &s;ome things that, by great exertions of &s;kill and in|trepedity, are in the power of brave men to effect; and on &s;ome particular occa&s;ions do happen, and can be well atte&s;ted; but a connected chain of marvelous exploits, where &s;torms and tempe&s;ts throw all into confusion, has not a &s;ufficient degree of probability.</P>
<P>The lo&s;s of men was con&s;iderable on both &s;ides, though according to our accounts, the French lo&s;t a great deal more than we did. Mr Bougainville, the famous and philo&s;ophical navigator, who was com|mander of the &s;hip that engaged Capt. Raynor, is &s;aid to have lo&s;t his arm in the action. The lo&s;s in the I&s;is is &s;aid to have been very trifling; but this is according to the ordinary reckoning of all exploits in this American war. The concealment of our lo&s;s has been one of the con&s;tant &s;chemes of the mini&s;try to keep up the &s;pirits of the people, and to hide the malignity of their own mi&s;management from the eye of the public. The young Duke of Anca&s;ter is &s;aid to have acquired great honour in this action. He acted as a volunteer, and behaved nobly. Had he lived and been employed in the &s;ervice of his country,
<PB N="492" REF="502">he promi&s;ed to have been an ornament to the Briti&s;h nation; but by a premature death, his country was deprived of one of its ornaments, and from whom &s;he had rea&s;on to expect the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential &s;ervices.</P>
<P>The Briti&s;h &s;quadron &s;uffered con&s;iderably in the &s;torm, and though, according to the be&s;t accounts, it was not &s;o much damaged as that of the French, yet the damages were &s;o con&s;iderable, as to keep the &s;hips at Sandy-Hook and New York &s;ome time, to repair their lo&s;s, which hindered them from pur&s;uing tho&s;e advantages which they are &s;aid to have gained. On the 20th of Augu&s;t the French fleet returned to Rhode-I&s;land, where they anchored without the har|bour, and &s;ailed from thence to Bo&s;ton en the 22d, in order to repair their &s;hattered &s;hips. Lord Howe, with great expedition, got his fleet repaired, and pur&s;ued with great earne&s;tne&s;s, hoping to overtake them before they reaehed Bo&s;ton, but in this he was di&s;appointed. Our expectations at home were great|ly rai&s;ed by the extravagant accounts which the mi|ni&s;terial agents had publi&s;hed concerning the advan|tages which Admiral Howe had gained over D'E&s;taing, and we were given to expect that not only the whole French fleet would be de&s;troyed, but that Bo&s;ton would &s;oon be reduced by the Engli&s;h admiral.</P>
<P>Tidings of this atchievement were for &s;ome time expected, and people were impatient to hear of the total ruin of the French fleet and the recovery of Bo&s;|ton; when, in&s;tead of this, they received the news of an American army landed on Long-I&s;land. Gen. Sullivan had landed on the north end of that i&s;land, in the month of Augu&s;t, with a de&s;ign to co-operate with D'E&s;taing and the French troops which he had
<PB N="493" REF="503">on board his &s;hips. On the very day that D'E&s;taing went out of the harbour to meet Lord Howe, Gen. Sullivan landed off Howland-Ferry, and had the French fleet &s;ucceeded in their enterprize, the ruin of our army had been inevitable. The weather was extremely bad, and prevented his getting up his &s;tores for &s;ome days, and of cour&s;e retarded the progre&s;s of his army. On the 17th they however broke ground on Honeyman's hill near the Briti&s;h works, and began to con&s;truct batteries and form lines, of approach. This alarmed our forces much, becau&s;e though they did not much dread an attack upon their front, they were yet afraid, that, while they were en|gaged with Sullivan in front, they &s;hould be attacked in the rear, or in the flanks, by the French land forces, which they heard were aboard the fleet. Our troops were however as active as po&s;&s;ible, and prepared to make the be&s;t defence they could. This was a &s;ad change of &s;ituation to the Briti&s;h troops, which they had now experienced ever &s;ince they left Philadel|phia. On other occa&s;ions they had been accu&s;tomed to attack and pur&s;ue, but now they were obliged to &s;tand upon the defen&s;ive. It has been ob&s;erved that General Pigot was under no great apprehen&s;ion from the force upon his front; the general object of ap|prehen&s;ion was the concurrent a&s;&s;ault of D'E&s;taing on the town and works towards the water, but the great point of danger was his landing a body of troops on the &s;outhern penin&s;ula, which would have laid the garri&s;on open in the rear, whil&s;t they were de&s;perately engaged in the front and flank, in defence of their works.</P>
<PB N="494" REF="504">
<P>Lord Howe's arrival in this critical in&s;tant, happily removed the&s;e apprehen&s;ions of danger, in a great mea&s;ure, and D'E&s;taing's departure to Bo&s;ton re|moved them entirely. The French admiral did not act wi&s;ely in &s;ailing out of the harbour to meet Lord Howe. He was &s;ecure in that &s;tation, again&s;t a much &s;uperior force than what Lord Howe commanded, and might have continued in the harbour, in &s;pite of all that the Engli&s;h admiral could have done. The nature of the port, the narrowne&s;s of the pa&s;&s;age from the &s;ea, with the means of defence afforded by the i&s;land of Conanicut, which was occupied by him|&s;elf and his allies, formed altogether &s;uch a &s;trong &s;e|curity to his fleet, that &s;carcely any naval &s;uperiority could have ju&s;tified any attempt upon it. He ought in the fir&s;t place to have &s;ecured his main object, which was now in his power, before he put to &s;ea, to engage or &s;eek for Lord Howe. In this ca&s;e he would have fulfilled the de&s;ign of his commi&s;&s;ion, and given effectual aid to his allies, whom he came to a&s;|&s;i&s;t. It mu&s;t have been either vanity or &s;tupidity that governed him on this occa&s;ion, for he lo&s;t the be&s;t op|portunity he po&s;&s;ibly could have wi&s;hed for, to have given an effectual blow to Great Britain. It was thought that his vanity was the principal cau&s;e of this fal&s;e &s;tep which he took. The glory of conquering an Engli&s;h admiral of &s;o great a name, and vanqui&s;h|ing a &s;quadron of Engli&s;h men of war, was thought to be the temptation that &s;educed the Count D'E&s;taing into that error into which he now fell. It is exceedingly amazing that vanity &s;hould have &s;o far bewildered his imagination, as to make him&s;elf a fool to the world, by giving up a certainty in hopes of
<PB N="495" REF="505">what was very uncertain. But it appears &s;till more &s;trange that he &s;hould have neglected to retrieve his error when he had it again in his power, when he re|turned to anchor the &s;econd time before Rhode-I&s;land. For if he had entered the harbour, and co-operated with the Americans, after he came back, in conform|ity with their earne&s;t expectations, the &s;tate of the garri&s;on would have been very perilous, and he would have had a fair opportunity of regaining, by one &s;troke, the failure of &s;ucce&s;s in his grand &s;cheme. He would have now had an opportunity of concilia|ting the affections of his new allies, who were not a little di&s;gu&s;ted at his former un&s;ucce&s;sful proceedings, by giving them an idea, which they were not very ready to entertain, of the vigour and efficacy of the French councils and arms. It has been ob&s;erved, with a great degree of truth, that his two di&s;ma&s;ted &s;hips could not have been repaired, nor the re&s;t of his &s;quadron refitted, at Rhode-I&s;land; but as they might have continued &s;afe there for any length of time, if he had &s;ucceeded in his object, this objection does not appear to be of &s;ufficient weight for its being abandoned. But it is probable that there were other rea&s;ons for his abandoning that &s;ituation, and the pro|ject which he had fir&s;t in view. He probably had heard of Admiral Byron's &s;quadron being near at hand, and was afraid of being blocked up in Rhode-I&s;land harbour, where he could not repair nor refit his &s;hattered fleet, and could not tell by what means be might get out of that &s;tation, and his whole fleet might have been lo&s;t for want of reparation, or fallen a prey to the enemy that was watching an opportu|nity to de&s;troy it. It is, upon the whole, manife&s;t that the Count D'E&s;taing was not &s;ufficiently qualified
<PB N="496" REF="506">for executing that project which &s;eems intended, by &s;ending that fleet to America. The whole of his conduct appears irrational and prepo&s;terous, fraught with folly and incon&s;i&s;tency. Both his conduct at Sandy-Hook, and his going out to &s;ea to meet Lord Howe, were actions, rather of a man that was not en|dowed with rea&s;on, than of an admiral entru&s;ted with &s;uch an important command. He &s;eems to have paid no regard to the nece&s;&s;ity of his new allies, who had been &s;educed through hopes of his a&s;&s;i&s;tance, to land their troops on Rhode-I&s;land, with a de&s;ign of drawing hence the Briti&s;h forces. The Americans complain loudly of his conduct; both the army on the i&s;land and the northern colonies exclaimed, That they had been, led into an expedition of prodigious ex|pence, labour, trouble, and danger, under the assu|rance of the mo&s;t effective operations of the French fleet. That under this &s;anction they had committed their lives and liberties on the inva&s;ion of an i&s;land, where, without a naval force and protection, they were likely to be enclo&s;ed like wild bea&s;ts, in a toil: and, That in this &s;ituation they were fir&s;t de&s;erted for a vain and fruitle&s;s pur&s;uit, and then totally abandon|ed, at the very time that they had brought the bu&s;i|ne&s;s, on their &s;ide, to the point of accompli&s;hment.</P>
<P>The coloni&s;ts &s;aw plainly through the mi&s;conduct of the French admiral, and judged of it in its true light: They perceived his vanity, pride, and want of conduct, and &s;poke freely of both, though they ob|&s;erved decency in their expre&s;&s;ions. By this fooli&s;h proceeding the Americans upon the i&s;land were brought into great danger, both by the de&s;ertion of the New-England and the Connecticut volunteers, and
<PB N="497" REF="507"><GAP DESC="MISSING">&s;ome divi&s;ion of tho&s;e that remained with him. It is &s;aid that tho&s;e that remained were &s;carcely equal in number to the garri&s;on of Engli&s;h troops that were upon the i&s;land. Sullivan, on this pre&s;&s;ing occa&s;ion, acted the part of a wi&s;e and prudent commander, and extricated him&s;elf out of this difficulty in a manner that would have done honour to the greate&s;t of ge|nerals; and his troops behaved like veterans of the fir&s;t rank. His management, in the whole, was di|rected with the mo&s;t con&s;ummate wi&s;dom.</P>
<P>General Sullivan having begun to &s;end off his hea|vy artillery and baggage on the 26th of Augu&s;t, he retreated from his lines on the 29th; and though he was clo&s;ely pur&s;ued and attacked vigorou&s;ly and re|peatedly in every quarter where there was an open|ing made, yet the Briti&s;h forces could make no im|pre&s;&s;ion upon his troops, &s;o as to interrupt their march, till they had reached the north end of the i&s;land, which they did with very little lo&s;s. So well had he taken his mea&s;ures, and &s;o judiciou&s;ly had he cho&s;en his po&s;ts, that the utmo&s;t vigour of the Briti&s;h troops could not make any impre&s;&s;ion upon his forces, &s;o as to gain any advantage of any con&s;e|quence. It was the cau&s;e of no &s;mall chagrin to the Briti&s;h troops that they could not gain any advantage over a number of militia, not &s;uperior to them&s;elves in any thing except a general, who had planned his march in &s;uch a manner, that it was impo&s;&s;ible for the Briti&s;h troops to attack them with any hope of &s;uc|ce&s;s. When Sullivan reached the north end of the i&s;land, he was, from the nature of the ground, and the &s;ituation of his po&s;ts, in a &s;tate of &s;ecurity. He had now time to pa&s;s his army over by way of Bri&s;tol
<PB N="498" REF="508">and Hoyland Ferries, on the night of the 30th, to the continent without interruption. It was a fortunate circum&s;tance for General Sullivan, that he was gone from the i&s;land at the time when General Clinton ar|rived, which was &s;oon after he had reached the con|tinent; for the united force of Clinton and Pigot would have been much more than a match for Sulli|van's troops. Time and experience produces &s;trange effects, and removes differences that &s;ome people ac|count impo&s;&s;ible. The Americans, who had in the beginning of the war, been the &s;port of Great Britain, and the object of the ridicule of her officers and &s;ol|diers, were now become the mo&s;t re&s;pectable anta|goni&s;ts, and in &s;ome in&s;tances, &s;uperior to her be&s;t troops.</P>
<P>Lord Howe, after having refitted his fleet with all the expedition he could, &s;ailed for the Bay of Bo&s;ton on the &s;ame day that General Sullivan abandoned Rhode-I&s;land, but upon his arrival found, to his great mortification, that D'E&s;taing had got there be|fore him. His vexation was increa&s;ed, when he &s;ound by a clo&s;e in&s;pection, that he was effectually covered in Nanta&s;ket Road, by the batteries erected, and the means of defence taken by the Americans and the French on the adjacent points and i&s;lands, that an attack upon him was utterly impracticable, with any pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s or advantage. It was expected at home, from the mini&s;terial accounts that were publi&s;hed, that both Bo&s;ton and the French fleet would &s;oon fall into the hands of our navy, as the French were &s;aid to be in want of all things ne|ce&s;&s;ary, and Bo&s;ton was in a very wretched &s;ituation, in want of nece&s;&s;ary provi&s;ion, and in no &s;tate of de|fence.
<PB N="499" REF="509">To enforce the&s;e &s;ugge&s;tions, it was report|ed that an irreconcileable variance had ari&s;en between the French troops and &s;ailors, and the town&s;men, on account of the former &s;aying ma&s;s, and performing other &s;ervices of the Church of Rome, in the city of Bo&s;ton: That the coloni&s;ts had refu&s;ed to &s;upply D'E&s;taing's fleet with nece&s;&s;ary provi&s;ion; and that all things tended to an open rupture between the coloni&s;ts and the French. The a&s;&s;urance and plau|&s;ibility with which the&s;e reports were publi&s;hed, made them gain credit for a time, among tho&s;e who did not enter deeply into an enquiry concerning their authenticity; but in a &s;hort time they were found to be mere contrivances of court paragraph writers, intended to keep up the &s;pirits of the people at home, and to prevent the &s;tocks from falling below the &s;tandard of national credit.</P>
<P>When the hopes of the nation &s;ub&s;ided, with re|gard to the &s;ucce&s;s of our fleets in America, for no account was as yet received concerning Admiral By|ron, the merchants concerned in the We&s;t India trade began to be greatly alarmed for the fate of the i&s;lands, in which the greate&s;t part of their fortunes was contained. They waited in a body, upon Lord Sandwich, and Lord George Germain, acquainting them, That &s;ince the la&s;t remon&s;trance relative to the protection of their properties in the Leeward I&s;lands, they had been rouzed to a more immediate &s;en&s;e of their danger, by the capture of Dominica; a capture, the &s;uddenne&s;s of which, and the ea&s;y manner in which it was effected, that could but give them the &s;tronge&s;t fears about many more of the i&s;lands, where they had a property (including Jamaica) of no le&s;s
<PB N="500" REF="510">than fifty millions of money: They therefore prayed their lord&s;hips, particularly the Fir&s;t Lord of the Ad|miralty, that they would take &s;uch mea&s;ures as to them&s;elves &s;eemed mo&s;t fitting, for the further &s;ecu|rity and protection of tho&s;e i&s;lands. They received for an&s;wer from Lord Sandwich, "That the Board of admiralty, no doubt, had the general protection of commerce at heart, but that the Count D'E&s;taing's fleet had &s;o much di&s;arranged all the purpo&s;es of that board, that a home defence was to be the fir&s;t ob|ject." Upon this they a&s;ked his lord&s;hip whether he had any po&s;itive information, that the Count D'E&s;taing had gone again to the We&s;t Indies. To which he an&s;wered, he did not at pre&s;ent po&s;itively know, but that if he had, Admiral Byron had orders to pur&s;ue him wherever he went, and he hoped would be &s;oon able to give a good account of him. The &s;ame Body renewed their application three days after, for the protection of their property, with greater earne&s;tne&s;s, on account of &s;ome fre&s;h advices they had received, but received the &s;ame an&s;wer. They then called upon his lord&s;hip to take notice that they had di&s;charged the duty they owed to them&s;elves and the public, and retired. Some time the year before the Fir&s;t Lord of the admiralty had publicly declared, that he had a fleet ready, &s;ufficient to combat the whole force of the Hou&s;e of Bourbon, but now he &s;ufficiently hinted that there was nece&s;&s;ity of home defence, and that he was nor able to keep the French from our own coa&s;ts. Though money had been granted for building and manning a fleet according to the de&s;ire of the mini|&s;try, yet now we were become the &s;port of the Hou&s;e of Bourbon, and forced to defend our own
<PB N="501" REF="511">coa&s;ts again&s;t a French inva&s;ion. This made the Fir&s;t Lord of the Admiralty appear exceedingly mean in the eyes of the public, and made Britain look little in the view of all the powers of Europe; &mdash;which in the la&s;t reign, under the influence of a mini&s;ter of true capacity, had made France and Spain yield in all quarters of the world, and all the nations of Europe pay her proper re&s;pect. Meanne&s;s and treachery to the public, had marked every foot&s;tep of the pre&s;ent mini&s;try, and falshood and folly had di&s;graced their coun&s;els ever &s;ince they came into office.</P>
<P>It was not for want of information that the admi|ralty &s;uffered the French fleet to get the &s;tart of them in going to America; for upon the 11th of April they were informed that D'E&s;taing was to &s;ail from Toulon between the 12th and 15th of that month, with ten &s;hips of the line and five frigates; but it was &s;aid the de&s;tination of that fleet was not known. Upon the 13th of April the Admiralty al&s;o received advice, that D'E&s;taing had arrived at Toulon the 27th of March with unlimited powers, and had added two &s;hips to his &s;quadron; and on the 21&s;t of April, they were informed that after the arrival of D'E&s;|taing at Toulon, the work was doubled to compleat that armament. A li&s;t of his whole fleet, with the number of guns and the names of the commanders, was received on the 27th of April, with an account of his intention of &s;ailing the next morning, and on the &s;ame day advice was received by expre&s;s, of Count D'E&s;taing's &s;quadron having &s;et &s;ail the 13th, at four in the afternoon, with a fair wind. Yet not|with&s;tanding this information, the French fleet was &s;uffered to pa&s;s the Straits without oppo&s;ition, and

This negligence or incapacity of the Fir&s;t Lord of the Admiralty, was much blamed by the nation, and even by &s;ome of the be&s;t friends of the mini&s;try, who were now a&s;hamed of his conduct, be|cau&s;e he had boa&s;ted &s;o much and done nothing.</P>
<P>The alarm which D'E&s;taing's fleet created among the traders to the We&s;t Indies, produced a petition to the king, from the planters and merchants, trading to tho&s;e parts, wherein they repre&s;ent, "That on the commencement of the unhappy divi&s;ions between this kingdom and the colonies in North America, being impre&s;&s;ed with a proper &s;en&s;e of duty to his Maje&s;ty, and of the circum&s;tances of their &s;ituation, they repre&s;ented to his mini&s;ters their apprehen&s;ions of the dangers and di&s;tre&s;&s;es to which the Sugar I&s;lands were nece&s;&s;arily expo&s;ed: That the fatal con|&s;equences thus apprehended, had in a great mea&s;ure been unhappily experienced, during the la&s;t three years, by a general &s;carcity of provi&s;ions in all the i&s;lands, (in &s;ome of them nearly approaching to a fa|mine) and by want of almo&s;t every article, e&s;&s;ential to the culture of their plantations; &s;o that their e&s;tates and property had been con&s;iderably impaired in value, and continued expo&s;ed to future diminution; whil&s;t their effects were captured on the high &s;eas, to a very great amount: That although they had early and anxiou&s;ly repre&s;ented to his maje&s;ty's mini&s;ters, the nece&s;&s;ity of an adequate protection for the i&s;lands, they had now to lament, from the lo&s;s of Dominica, and the imminent danger of other i&s;lands, that the frequent applications which they had made for pro|tection, had not had the de&s;ired effect: That they
<PB N="503" REF="513">were now in the mo&s;t anxious &s;tate of &s;u&s;pence, from the delay of the &s;uccours from New York to the Leeward i&s;lands, which had been &s;o un&s;ea&s;onably afforded, as to leave all tho&s;e i&s;lands expo&s;ed to the further ho&s;tile attempts of the enemy. And though the a&s;&s;urances of protection given to them by his ma|je&s;ty's mini&s;ters, had tended to remove their immedi|ate apprehen&s;ions, yet they appeared too general and precarious to quiet their minds, as to the &s;afety of the Leeward I&s;lands; whil&s;t the important i&s;land of Ja|maica had been left almo&s;t to its own efforts; which, from the comparatively &s;mall number of white Inha|bitants, were become peculiarly &s;evere, and, joined to the &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of culture nece&s;&s;arily con&s;equent on military duty, mu&s;t in time prove ruinous; a naval force being the principal &s;ecurity of the i&s;lands in general. Labouring under the weight of the&s;e ca|lamities, they &s;aid they could not avoid further humbly expre&s;&s;ing to his maje&s;ty, their melancholy apprehen|&s;ions, le&s;t the de&s;olating &s;y&s;tem, which appeared to them to have been lately denounced by his maje&s;ty's commi&s;&s;ioners in North America, might be produc|tive of con&s;equences, to them, at pre&s;ent, not fully fore&s;een, nor &s;ufficiently fore&s;een by his maje&s;ty's &s;er|vants. What mo&s;tly alarmed the merchants, who&s;e property was chiefly in tho&s;e i&s;lands, was, that the French and Americans &s;hould practice, according to the &s;y&s;tem publicly avowed by the commi&s;&s;ioners, and lay wa&s;te and de&s;troy all the i&s;lands as far as they could. The merchants were not &s;ingular in their ap|prehen&s;ions on this head; for thirty-one lords in par|liament expre&s;&s;ed the &s;ame fears and apprehen&s;ions, in their di&s;&s;ent from a vote of the higher hou&s;e, De|cember
<PB N="504" REF="514">7, this year, upon an addre&s;s to his maje&s;ty, to expre&s;s the di&s;plea&s;ure of that hou&s;e, again&s;t the manife&s;to of the commi&s;&s;ioners, concerning the cruel mea&s;ures that were threatened in that manife&s;to. When the que&s;tion was put upon the motion, it was, by a great majority, rejected, and the following rea|&s;ons of di&s;&s;ent from the vote, were given by 31 lords, which &s;hew their minds on the &s;ubect.</P>
<P N="1">I. Becau&s;e the public law of nations, in affirmance of the dictates of nature and the precepts of revealed religion, forbids us to re&s;ort to the extremes of war upon our own opinion of their experience, or in any ca&s;e to carry on war for the purpo&s;e of de&s;olation. We know that the rights of war are odious, and, in|&s;tead of being extended upon loo&s;e con&s;tructions and &s;peculations of danger, ought to be bound up and limited by all the re&s;traints of the mo&s;t rigorous con|&s;truction. We are &s;hocked to &s;ee the fir&s;t law of na|ture, &s;elf-pre&s;ervation, perverted and abu&s;ed into a principle de&s;tructive of all other laws; and a rule laid down, by which our own &s;afety is rendered incompa|tible with the pro&s;perity of mankind. Tho&s;e objects of war, which cannot be compa&s;&s;ed by fair and ho|nourable ho&s;tility, ought not to be compa&s;&s;ed at all. An end that has no means, but &s;uch as are unlaw|ful, is an unlawful end. The Manife&s;to expre&s;sly founds the change it announces, from a qualified and mitigated war to a war of extremity and de&s;olation, on the certainty that the provinces mu&s;t be indepen|dent, and mu&s;t become an acce&s;&s;ion to the &s;trength of an enemy. In the mid&s;t of the calamities, by which our lo&s;s of empire has been preceded and accompa|nied; in the mid&s;t of our apprehen&s;ions for the far|ther calamities which impend over us, it is a matter
<PB N="505" REF="515">of fre&s;h grief and accumulated &s;hame, to &s;ee, from a commi&s;&s;ion under the great &s;eal of this kingdom, a declaration for de&s;olating a va&s;t continent, &s;olely be|cau&s;e we had not the rea&s;on to retain, or the power to &s;ubdue it.</P>
<P N="2">II. Becau&s;e the avowal of a deliberate purpo&s;e of violating the law of nations mu&s;t give an alarm to every &s;tate in Europe; all commonwealths have a concern in the law, and are its natural avengers. At this time, &s;urrounded by enemies and de&s;titute of all allies, it is not nece&s;&s;ary to &s;harpen and embitter the ho&s;tility of declared foes, or to provoke to enmi|mity neutral &s;tates. We tru&s;t, that by the natural &s;trength of this kingdom we are &s;ecured from a fo|reign conque&s;t, but no nation is &s;ecured from the in|va&s;ion and incur&s;ions of enemies. And it &s;eems to us the height of phren&s;y, as well as wickedne&s;s to expo&s;e this country to cruel depredations, and other outrages too &s;hocking to mention (but which are all contained in the idea of the extremes of war and de|&s;olation) by e&s;tabli&s;hing a fal&s;e, &s;hameful, and per|nicious maxim, that, where we have no intere&s;t to pre&s;erve, we are called upon by nece&s;&s;ity to de&s;troy. This kingdom has long enjoyed a profound internal peace, and has flouri&s;hed above all others in its arts and enjoyments in that happy &s;tate. It has been the admiration of the world for its cultivation and its plenty for the comforts of the poor, the &s;plendor of the rich, and the content and pro&s;perity of all. This &s;ituation of &s;afety may be attributed to the greatne&s;s of our power. It is more becoming, and more true, that we ought to attribute that &s;afety, and the power which procured it, to the antient ju&s;tice, honour, humanity, and genero&s;ity of the kingdom, which
<PB N="506" REF="516">brought down the ble&s;&s;ing of providence on a people who made their pro&s;perity a benefit to the world, and intere&s;ted all nations in their fortune, who&s;e ex|ample of mildne&s;s and benignity at once humanized others, and rendered it&s;elf inviolable. In departing from tho&s;e &s;olid principles, and vainly tru&s;ting to the fragility of human force, and to the efficacy of arms, rendered impotent by their perver&s;ion, we lay down principles, and furni&s;h examples of the mo&s;t atrocious barbarity. We are to dread that all our power, peace, and opulence, &s;hould vani&s;h like a dream, and that the cruelties which we think &s;afe to exerci&s;e, becau&s;e their immediate object is remote, may be brought to the coa&s;ts, perhaps to the bo&s;om, of this kingdom.</P>
<P N="3">III. Becau&s;e, if the explanation, given in debate, be expre&s;&s;ive of the true &s;en&s;e of the article in the manife&s;to, &s;uch explanation ought to be made, and by as high authority as that under which the excep|tionable article was originally publi&s;hed. The natu|ral and obvious &s;en&s;e vindicates, that the extremes of war had hitherto been checked: That his maje&s;ty's generals had hitherto forborne (upon principles of benignity and policy) to de&s;olate the country; but that the whole nature and future conduct of the war mu&s;t be changed, in order to render the American acce&s;&s;ion of as little avail, to France, as po&s;&s;ible. This, in our apprehen&s;ions, conveys a menace of carrying the war to extremes, and to de&s;olate, or it means nothing. And, as &s;ome &s;peeches in the Hou&s;e (how|ever palliated), and as &s;ome acts of &s;ingular cruelty, and perfectly conformable to the apparent ideas in the manife&s;to, have lately been exerci&s;ed, it becomes the more nece&s;&s;ary, for the honour and &s;afety of this
<PB N="507" REF="517">nation, that this explanation &s;hould be made. As it is refu&s;ed, we have only to clear our&s;elves to our con|&s;ciences, to our country, to our neighbours, and to every individual who may &s;uffer in con&s;equence of this atrocious menace, of all part in the guilt, or in the evils that may become its puni&s;hment. And we chu&s;e to draw our&s;elves out, and to di&s;tingui&s;h our&s;elves to po&s;terity, as not being the fir&s;t to renew, to approve, or to tolerate the return of that ferocity and barbari&s;m in war, which a beneficent religion, enlightened manners, and true military honour, had for a long time bani&s;hed from the Chri&s;tian world.</P>
<P>Amid&s;t all the horrors of war, and the expectations of battles, our officers and army, on occa&s;ions, re|laxed into the mo&s;t childi&s;h and trifling diver&s;ions. When Sir William Howe was about to come away to England, and leave the army, out of re&s;pect to him, the following mi&s;cellaneous entertainment was exhi|bited, which I &s;hall give in the words of a letter from an officer to his corre&s;pondent in London.</P>
<P>"For the fir&s;t time in my life I write to you with unwillingne&s;s. The &s;hip that carries Sir William Howe will convey this letter to you; and not even the plea&s;ure of conver&s;ing with my friend, can &s;ecure me from the general dejection I &s;ee around me, or re|move the &s;hare I mu&s;t take in the univer&s;al regret and di&s;appointment which his approaching departure hath &s;pread throughout the whole army. We &s;ee him taken from us at a time when we mo&s;t &s;tand in need of &s;o &s;kilful and popular a commander. When the experience of three years, and the knowledge he hath acquired of the country and people, have added to the confidence we always placed in his conduct and
<PB N="508" REF="518">abilities. You know he was ever a favourite with the military; but the affection and attachment all ranks of officers in his army bear him, can only be known by tho&s;e who have at this time &s;een them in their ef|fects. I do not believe there is upon record an in|&s;tance of a commander in chief having &s;o univer&s;ally endeared him&s;elf to tho&s;e under his command; or of one who received &s;uch &s;ignal and flattering proofs of their love. That our &s;entiments might be the more univer&s;ally and unequivocally known, it was re&s;olved among&s;t us, that we &s;hould give him a &s;plendid an entertainment as the &s;hortne&s;s of the time, and our pre&s;ent &s;ituation, would allow us. For the expences the whole army would have contributed; but it was requi&s;ite to draw the line &s;omewhere, and twenty-four field officers joined in a &s;ub&s;cription adequate to the plan they meant to adopt. I know your curio&s;ity will be rai&s;ed on this occa&s;ion; I &s;hall therefore give you as particular an account of our mi&s;chianza as I have been able to collect. From the name you will perceive that it was made up of a variety of enter|tainments. Four of the gentlemen &s;ub&s;cribers were appointed managers, Sir John Wrotte&s;ly, Col. O' Hara, Major Gardiner, and Montre&s;or, the chief engineer. On the tickets of admi&s;&s;ion, which they gave out for Monday the 18th, was engraved, in a &s;hield, a view of the &s;ea, with the &s;etting &s;un, and on the wreath, the words <HI>Luceo di&s;udens, aucto &s;plendore re&s;urgam.</HI> At the top was the general's cre&s;t, with <HI>vive vale.</HI> All round the &s;hield ran a vignette, and various military trophies filled up the ground. A grand regatta began the entertainment. It con&s;i&s;ted of three divi&s;ions. In the fir&s;t was the Ferret galley,
<PB N="509" REF="519">having on board &s;everal general officers, and a num|ber of ladies. In the centre was the Hu&s;&s;ar galley, with Sir William and Lord Howe, Sir Henry Clinton, the officers of their &s;uite, and &s;ome ladies. The Cornwallis galley brought up the rear, having on board General Knyphau&s;en and his &s;uite, three Bri|ti&s;h generals, and a party of ladies. On each quar|ter of the&s;e gallies, and forming their divi&s;ion, were, five flat boats, lined with green cloth, and filled with ladies and gentlemen. In front of the whole were three flat boats, with a band of mu&s;ic in each; &s;ix barges rowed about each flank, to keep off the &s;warm of boats that covered the river from &s;ide to &s;ide. The gallies were dre&s;&s;ed out in a variety of colours and &s;treamers, and in each flat boat was di&s;|played the flag of its own divi&s;ion. In the &s;tream oppo&s;ite the centre of the city, the Fanny armed &s;hip, magnificently decorated, was placed at anchor, and at &s;ome di&s;tance a-head lay his Maje&s;ty's &s;hip the Roebuck, with the admiral's flag hoi&s;ted at the fore-top-ma&s;t head. The tran&s;port &s;hips, extending in a line the whole length of the town, appeared with colours flying, and crowded with &s;pectators, as were al&s;o the openings of the &s;everal wharfs on &s;hore, ex|hibiting a mo&s;t picture&s;que enlivening &s;cene. The rendezvous was at Knight's Wharf, at the north end of the city. By half after four the whole com|pany were embarked. And the &s;ignal being made by Vigilant's manning &s;hip, the three divi&s;ions rowed &s;lowly down, pre&s;erving their proper intervals, and keeping time to the mu&s;ic that led the fleet. Arrived between the Fanny and the Market-Wharf, a &s;ignal was made for one of the boats a-head, and the whole
<PB N="510" REF="520">lay upon their cars, while the mu&s;ic played, <HI>God &s;ave the King,</HI> and three cheers given from the ve&s;&s;els were returned from the multitude on &s;hore. By this time the flood tide became too rapid for the gallies to advance; they were therefore quitted, and the company di&s;po&s;ed of the different barges.</P>
<P>This alteration broke in upon the order of the proce&s;&s;ion, but was nece&s;&s;ary to give &s;ufficient time for di&s;playing the entertainment that was prepared on &s;hore.</P>
<P>The landing-place was at the old fort, a little to the &s;outhward of the town, fronting the building pre|pared for the reception of the company, about four bundred yards from the water, by a gentle a&s;cent. As &s;oon as the general's barge was &s;een to pu&s;h for the &s;hore, a &s;alute of 17 guns was fired from the Roebuck, and, after &s;ome interval, by the &s;ame number from the Vigilant. The company, as they di&s;embarked, arranged them&s;elves into a line of pro|ce&s;&s;ion, and advanced through an avenue formed by two files of grenadiers, and a line of light hor&s;e, &s;upporting each file.</P>
<P>This avenue led to a &s;quare lawn of 150 yards on each &s;ide, lined with troops, and properly prepared for the exhibition of a tilt and tournament, according to the cu&s;toms and ordinances of antient chivalry. We proceeded through the centre of the &s;quare. The mu&s;ic, con&s;i&s;ting of all the bands of the army, moved in the front. The managers, with favours of blue and white ribbands in their brea&s;t, followed next in order. The general, admiral, and re&s;t of the company &s;ucceeded promi&s;cuou&s;ly. In the front appeared the building, bounding the view through a
<PB N="511" REF="521">vi&s;ta, formed by two triumphal arches, erected at proper intervals, in a line with the landing-place. Two pavilions, with rows of benches, ri&s;ing one above the other, and &s;erving as the advanced wings of the triumphal arch, received the ladies while the gentlemen ranged them&s;elves in convenient order on each &s;ide. On the front &s;eat of each pavilion were placed &s;even of the principal young ladies of the country, dre&s;&s;ed in Turki&s;h habits, and wearing in their turbans, the favours with which they meant to reward the &s;everal knights who were to contend in their honour.</P>
<P>The&s;e arrangements were &s;carce made, when the &s;ound of trumpets were heard at a di&s;tance; and a band of knights dre&s;&s;ed in antient habits of white and red &s;ilk, and mounted on grey hor&s;es, richly capari|&s;oned in trappings of the &s;ame colours, entered the li&s;t, attended by their e&s;quires on foot, in &s;uitable apparel, in the following order: Four trumpeters, properly habited, their trumpets decorated with pen|dant &s;mall banners;&mdash;a herald in his robes of cere|mony; on his tunic was the device of his band, two ro&s;es intertwined with the motto, <HI>We droop when &s;e|parated.</HI> Lord Cathcart, &s;uperbly mounted on a managed hor&s;e, appeared as chief of the&s;e knights; two young black &s;laves, with &s;a&s;hes and drawers of blue and white &s;ilk, wearing large &s;ilver cla&s;ps round their necks and arms, their brea&s;ts and &s;houlders bare, held his &s;tirrups. On his right hand walked Capt. Hazard, and on his left Capt. Brownlow, his two e&s;quires, one bearing the lance the other the &s;hield. His device was Cupid riding on a Lion, the motto, <HI>Surmounted by Love.</HI> His lord&s;hip appeared in honour
<PB N="512" REF="522">of Mi&s;s Auchmuty. Then came in order the knights of his band, each attended by his e&s;quire, having his lance and &s;hield. Fir&s;t knight, the Hon. Capt. Cathcart, in honour of Mi&s;s Ann White, e&s;quire, Capt. Peters, the device a heart and &s;word, the motto, <HI>Love and Honour.</HI> The &s;econd knight, Lieu|tenant Bygrove, in honour of Mi&s;s Craig, his e&s;quire Lieutenant Nichols, the device, Cupid tracing a circle, the motto, <HI>Without End.</HI> The third knight, Capt Andre, in honour of Mi&s;s M'Chew, his e&s;quire Lieutenant Andre, the device, two game cocks fighting, the motto, <HI>No Rival.</HI> The fourth knight, Capt. Horneck, in honour of Mi&s;s N. Redman, the e&s;quire Lieutenant Talbot, the device, a burning heart, and the motto <HI>Ab&s;ence cannot extingui&s;h.</HI> The fifth knight, Capt. Matthews, in honour of Mi&s;s Bond, e&s;quire, Lieutenant Hamilton, device, a wing|ed heart, the motto, <HI>Each Fair by Turn.</HI> The &s;ixth knight, Lieutenant Sloper, in honour of Mi&s;s Shipen, e&s;quire, Lieutenant Brown, device, a heart and &s;word, motto, <HI>Honour and the Fair.</HI></P>
<P>After they had made the circuit of the &s;quare and &s;aluted the ladies, as they pa&s;&s;ed the pavilions, they ranged them&s;elves in a line, each that in which were the ladies of their device; and the herald (Mr Beau|mont) advancing into the centre of the &s;quare, after a flouri&s;h of trumpets, proclaimed the following challenge: The knights of the blended ro&s;e, by me, their herald, proclaim and a&s;&s;ert, that the ladies of the blended ro&s;e, excel in wit, beauty, and every accompli&s;hment, tho&s;e of the whole world; and &s;hould any knight or knights, be &s;o hardy as to di&s;|pute or deny it, they are ready to enter the li&s;ts
<PB N="513" REF="523">with them, and maintain their a&s;&s;ertions, by deeds of arms, according to the laws of antient chivalry. On the third repetition of the challenge, the &s;ound of the trumpets was heard from the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the &s;quare; and another herald with four trumpeters, dre&s;&s;ed in black and orange, gallopped into the li&s;ts. He was met by the herald of the blended ro&s;e, and after a &s;hort parley, they both advanced in front of the pavilions, when the black herald (Lieutenant More) ordered his trumpets to &s;ound, and then pro|claimed defiance to the challenge in the following words:</P>
<P>The knights of the burning mountains pre&s;ent them&s;elves here, not to conte&s;t by words, but to di&s;approve by deeds, the vain-glorious a&s;&s;ertions of the knights of the blended ro&s;e, and enter the&s;e li&s;ts to maintain, that the ladies of the burning mountains are not excelled in beauty, virtue, or accompli&s;h|ments, by any of the univer&s;e. He then returned to the part of the barrier through which he had en|tered; and &s;hortly after, the black knights, attend|ed by their e&s;quires, rode into the li&s;ts in the fol|lowing order: Four trumpeters preceding the he|rald, on who&s;e tunic was repre&s;ented, a mountain &s;ending forth flames, with this motto, <HI>I burn for ever.</HI> Captain Wat&s;on, of the guards, as chief, dre&s;&s;ed in a magnificent &s;uit of black &s;ilk and orange, and mounted on a black managed hor&s;e with trappings of the &s;ame colour with his own dre&s;s, appeared in honour of Mi&s;s Franks. He was attended in the &s;ame manner as Lord Cathcart. Captain Scot bore his lance, and Lieutenant Littleton his &s;hield. The device, a heart with a wreath of flowers, and the motto <HI>Love and
<PB N="514" REF="524">Glory.</HI> Six other knights, with e&s;quires, devices, and mottos, &s;uitable to the occa&s;ion, at la&s;t advan|ced, and after they had rode round the li&s;ts and made their obei&s;ance to the ladies, drew up fronting the black knights, and the chief of the&s;e having thrown down his gauntlet, the chief of the black knights directed his e&s;quire to take it up. The knights then received their lances from their e&s;quires, fixed their &s;hields on their left arms, and making a general &s;alute to each other, by a very graceful move|ment of their lances, turned round to take their ca|reer, and encountering in full gallop, &s;hivered their &s;pears. In the &s;econd and third encounters they di&s;charged their pi&s;tols. In the fourth they fought with their &s;words. At length the two chiefs &s;purring into the centre, engaged furiou&s;ly in &s;ingle combat, till the mar&s;hal of the field, Major Groyne, ru&s;hed in between the chiefs, and declared that the fair dam&s;els of the blended ro&s;e and the burning mountain, were perfectly &s;atisfied with the proofs of love, and the &s;ignal feats of valour given by their re&s;pective knights; and commanded them, as they prized the future fa|vour of their mi&s;tre&s;&s;es, that they would in&s;tantly de|&s;i&s;t from further combat. Obedience being paid, by the chiefs, to this order, they joined their re&s;pective bands. The white knights and their attendants filed off to the left, the black knights to the right, and, after pa&s;&s;ing each other at the lower &s;ide of the quadrangle, moved up alternately till they approach|ed the pavilions of the ladies, when they gave a ge|neral &s;alute.</P>
<P>A pa&s;&s;age being opened between the two pavilions, the knights preceded by the e&s;quires, and the band
<PB N="515" REF="525">of mu&s;ic, rode through the fir&s;t triumphal arch, and arranged them&s;elves on the right and left. The arch in honour of Lord Howe, pre&s;ented two fronts in the Tu&s;can order, the pediment was adorned with various naval trophies, and at the top was the figure of Neptune, with a trident in his right hand. In a neck on each &s;ide &s;tood a &s;ailor with a drawn cutla&s;s. Three plumes of feathers were placed on the &s;ummit of each wing, and in the entablature was this in&s;crip|tion, <HI>Laus illi debitur et alme gratia major.</HI> The in|terval between the two arches was an avenue 300 feet long and 34 broad; it was lined on each &s;ide by a file of troops, and the colours of all the army plant|ed at proper di&s;tances, had a beautiful effect in di|ver&s;ifying the &s;cene. Between the&s;e colours the knights and e&s;quires took their &s;tations. The bands continued to play &s;everal pieces of mu&s;ic. The com|pany moved forward in proce&s;&s;ion with the ladies in the Turki&s;h habits in front; as the&s;e pa&s;&s;ed they were &s;aluted by their knights, who then di&s;mounted and joined them, and in this order we were all con|ducted into a garden that fronted the hou&s;e, through the &s;econd triumphal arch dedicated to the general. This arch was al&s;o built in the Tu&s;can order. On the interior part of the pediment was planted a plume of feathers and various military trophies. At the top &s;tood the figure of Fame, and in the entablature this device, <HI>I bone quo virtus tua te vocet pede fau&s;to.</HI> On the right hand pillar was placed a bomb &s;hell, and on the left a flaming heart. The front next the hou&s;e was adorned with preparations for the fire-work. From the garden we a&s;cended a flight of &s;teps, covered with carpets, which led into a &s;pacious
<PB N="516" REF="526">hall; the panels painted in imitation of Sienna mar|ble, enclo&s;ing fe&s;toons of white marble: The &s;urba&s;e and all below was black. In this hall and in the ad|joining apartments, were prepared, tea, lemonade, and other cooling liquors, to which the company &s;eated them&s;elves; during which time the knights came in, and on the knee received their favours from their re&s;pective ladies. One of the&s;e rooms was af|terwards appropriated for the u&s;e of the Pharoah table; as you entered it you &s;aw, on a panel over the chimney, a <HI>cornu-copiae</HI> exuberently filled with flowers of the riche&s;t colours; over the door as you went out, another pre&s;ented it&s;elf, &s;hrunk, rever&s;ed, and emptied.</P>
<P>From the&s;e apartments we were conducted up to a ball-room, decorated in a light elegant &s;tile of paint|ing. The ground was a pale blue, pannelled with a &s;mall gold head, and the interior filled with dropping fe&s;toons of flowers in their natural colours. Below the &s;urba&s;e the ground was of ro&s;e pink, with dra|pery fe&s;tooned in blue. The&s;e decorations were heightened by eighty-five mirrors, decked with ro&s;e-pink &s;ilk ribbands, and artificial flowers; and in the intermediate &s;paces were 34 branches with wax lights, ornamented in a &s;imilar manner. On the &s;ame floor were four drawing-rooms, with &s;ide-boards of re|fre&s;hments, decorated and lighted in the &s;ame &s;tile and ta&s;te as the ball-room. The ball was opened with the knights and their ladies; and the dances continued till ten o'clock, when the windows were thrown open, and a magnificent bouquet of rockets began the fire-works. The&s;e were planned by Capt. Mount Tre&s;or, the chief engineer, and con&s;i&s;ted of
<PB N="517" REF="527">twenty different exhibitions di&s;played under his di|rection, with the happie&s;t &s;ucce&s;s, and in the highe&s;t &s;tile of beauty. Towards the conclu&s;ion the interior part of the triumphal arch was illuminated amid&s;t an uninterrupted flight of rockets and bur&s;ting of ba|loons. The military trophies on each &s;ide a&s;&s;umed a variety of tran&s;parent colours. The &s;hell and the flaming heart on the wings, &s;ent forth Chine&s;e foun|tains &s;ucceeded by fire-pots. Fame appeared on the top &s;pangled with &s;tars, and from her trumpet blow|ing the following device, <HI>Tes Lauriers, &s;ont immortels;</HI> a &s;auter of rockets, bur&s;ting from the pediment, the <HI>feu d' artifice.</HI> At twelve &s;upper was announced, and large folding doors, hitherto artfully concealed, being &s;uddenly thrown open, di&s;covered a magnifi|cent &s;aloon of 210 feet by 40, and 22 feet in height, with three alcoves on each &s;ide, which &s;erved for &s;ide|boards. The ceiling was the &s;egment of a circle, and the &s;ides were painted a light &s;traw colour, with vine leaves and fe&s;toon flowers, &s;ome in a bright and &s;ome in a darki&s;h green. Fifty-&s;ix large pier gla&s;&s;es, ornamented with green &s;ilk, artificial flowers, and ribbands, and a hundred branches with three lights in each, trimmed in the fame manner as the mirrors; eighteen lu&s;tres, each with twenty-four lights, &s;u&s;|pended from the ceiling, and ornamented as the branches; 300 wax tapers di&s;po&s;ed along the &s;upper tables; 430 covers, 1,200 di&s;hes; 24 black &s;laves, in oriental dre&s;&s;es, with &s;ilver collars and bracelets, ranged in two lines, and bending to the ground as the general and admiral approached the &s;aloon; all the&s;e forming together the mo&s;t brilliant a&s;&s;emblage of gay objects, and appearing at once as we entered
<PB N="518" REF="528">by an ea&s;y de&s;cent, exhibited a <HI>coup d' oeil,</HI> beyond de&s;cription magnificent. Towards the end of &s;upper the herald of the blended ro&s;e, in his habit of cere|mony, attended by his trumpets, entered the &s;aloon, and proclaimed the king's health, the queen and royal family, the army and navy with their re&s;pective commanders, the knights and their ladies, and the ladies in general; each of the&s;e toa&s;ts was followed by a flouri&s;h of mu&s;ic. After &s;upper we returned to the ball-room, and continued to dance till four o'clock.</P>
<P>Such is the de&s;cription, though a very faint one, of the mo&s;t &s;plendid entertainment, I believe, ever given by an army to their general; but what mu&s;t be mo&s;t grateful to Sir William Howe, is the &s;pirit and motives from whence it was given. He goes from this place to-morrow; but as I under&s;tand he means to &s;tay a day or two, with his brother, on board the the Eagle at Billing&s;port, I &s;hall not &s;eal this letter till I &s;ee him depart from Philadelphia.</P>
<P>I am ju&s;t returned, Sunday the 24th, from conduct|ing our beloved general to the water &s;ide, and have &s;een him receive a more flattering te&s;timony of the love and attachment of the army, than all the pomp and &s;plendor of the mi&s;chianza could convey to him. I have &s;een the mo&s;t gallant of of our officers, whom I lea&s;t &s;u&s;pected of giving &s;uch in&s;tances of their af|fection, &s;hed tears while they bid him fare well. The gallant and affectionate general of the He&s;&s;ians, Knyphau&s;en, was &s;o moved that he could not fini&s;h a compliment he began to pay him, in his own name and that of his officers who attended him. Sir Henry Clinton attended him to the wharf, where Lord
<PB N="519" REF="529">Howe received him into his barge, and they are both gone down to Billing&s;port. On my return I &s;aw nothing but dejected countenances."</P>
<P>This new exhibition of chivalry, which appears to have been founded upon the plan of the renowned Knight of La Mancha, can &s;carcely be con&s;idered as worthy either of the expence that was be&s;towed upon it, or of the characters of the Briti&s;h officers who devi&s;ed it and put it in execution. The whole of this unfortunate and baneful war, has, &s;ince the be|ginning of it, through all its &s;tages, been a very &s;trange mi&s;chianza; a mi&s;cellany of expence, inju&s;tice, and di&s;appointment. Don Quixote, and his renowned e&s;quire, in all their adventures, &s;carcely ever en|gaged in one more ab&s;urd and ridiculous, than the American war; and in &s;ome future period, the inha|bitants of the world will be ready to conclude that the &s;tory concerning this war has been founded upon the&s;e principles of knight errantry, which naturally lead men to very &s;trange and wonderful adventures. In the mid&s;t of &s;o dangerous and unfortunate a war, it might have been expected the Briti&s;h officers would have been otherwi&s;e employed than in expend|ing their money in empty &s;hews and regattas, or in daffling with the ladies of the ruined colonies. What|ever regard might be expre&s;&s;ed in this pompous <HI>&s;hew</HI> to Sir William Howe, yet it mu&s;t be accounted a very &s;trange method of expre&s;&s;ing it; and the &s;ilent grief of General Knyphau&s;en expre&s;&s;ed his regard more fully than the whole expence of the <HI>mi&s;chianza.</HI> This mi&s;cellaneous entertainment was a prologue to that adventure which was &s;oon after made by our army, in pa&s;&s;ing through the Jer&s;ies, to Sandy-Hook,
<PB N="520" REF="530">where the knights of the blended ro&s;e, and tho&s;e of the burning mountain, were under the nece&s;&s;ity of performing a real turnament for their own pre&s;erva|tion, where the honour of their ladies was but indif|ferently &s;upported. Had they fore&s;een what was &s;o &s;oon to happen, it would have, in a great mea&s;ure, &s;uppre&s;&s;ed &s;ome of that wanton folly which appeared in the exhibition of the mi&s;chianza. It was truly a very fooli&s;h re&s;olution to tran&s;mit this piece of mad|ne&s;s over the Atlantic, to Great Britain, with &s;o much approbation.</P>
<P>This &s;eems to have been the only &s;ummer &s;ince the beginning of the American war when the parties had lei&s;ure to perform trifles, and relax from the &s;everi|ties of military di&s;cipline. The Americans, on their &s;ide, but for a different rea&s;on, had al&s;o a &s;ort of mi&s;|chianza in their congre&s;s. Mon&s;ieur Gerard had ar|rived at Philadelphia &s;ome time in the &s;ummer, as plenipotentiary from the French King, and had an au|dience of the congre&s;s. This happened in le&s;s than three months after General Howe's mi&s;chianza; &s;o that Philadelphia, that had been, during the winter, the &s;eat of arms, and the rendezvous of war, was, du|ring the summer, turned into a city of plea&s;ure, filled with all the gaiety of knight errantry, and the &s;plen|dour of a court. As &s;ome account has been given of the &s;plendid entertainment which was made to Sir. William Howe, by the officers of the army, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to &s;hew the reception which Mon&s;ieur Ge|rard received from the congre&s;s at his fir&s;t audience, as mini&s;ter and plenipotentiary of the French King. This will help to relieve the minds of the readers from the fatigue of an uniform contemplation of de|&s;truction
<PB N="521" REF="531">and &s;laughter, and prepare them for a view of tho&s;e barbarities that will be laid open in the fu|ture part of this hi&s;tory. The manner in which Mon&s;ieur Gerard was introduced, the letter from the French King, which he delivered, his &s;peech to the Congre&s;s, and the pre&s;ident's an&s;wer, &s;hall be given in their own words.</P>
<P>La&s;t Thur&s;day, Augu&s;t 11th, being the day ap|pointed by Congre&s;s for the audience of the Sieur Gerard, mini&s;ter and plenipotentiary from his Mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ty, that mini&s;ter received audience ac|cordingly. In pur&s;uance of the ceremonial e&s;tabli&s;h|ed by Congre&s;s, the Hon. Richard Henry Lee, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> one of the delegates from Virginia, and the Hon. Sa|muel Adams, one of the delegates from Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ett's Bay, in a coach and &s;ix provided by Congre&s;s, waited upon the mini&s;ter at his hou&s;e. In a few minutes the two delegates entered the coach, Mr Lee placing him&s;elf at the mini&s;ter's left hand, on the back &s;eat, Mr Adams occupying the front &s;eat; the mini&s;ter's chariot being behind, received his &s;ecretary. The carriages being arrived at the State Hou&s;e in the city, the two members of Congre&s;s, placing them&s;elves at the mini&s;ter's left hand, a little before one o'clock, introduced to his chair in the Congre&s;s Chamber.</P>
<P>The pre&s;ident and Congre&s;s &s;itting, the mini&s;ter being &s;eated, he gave his credentials into the hands of the &s;ecretary, who advanced and delivered them to the pre&s;ident. The &s;ecretary of Congre&s;s then read and tran&s;lated them; which being done, Mr Lee announced the mini&s;ter to the pre&s;ident and Con|gre&s;s: at nine the pre&s;ident, the Congre&s;s, and the mini&s;ter ro&s;e together; he bowed to the pre&s;ident and the Congre&s;s; they bowed to him; whereupon
<PB N="522" REF="532">the whole &s;eated them&s;elves. In a moment the mini|&s;ter ro&s;e and made a &s;peech to Congre&s;s, while they were all &s;itting. The &s;peech being fini&s;hed, the mi|ni&s;ter &s;at down, and giving a copy of his &s;peech to his &s;ecretary, he pre&s;ented it to the pre&s;ident. The pre&s;ident and the Congre&s;s then ro&s;e, and the pre&s;i|dent pronounced their an&s;wer to the &s;peech, the mi|ni&s;ter &s;tanding all the time. The an&s;wer being end|ed, the whole were again &s;eated, and the pre&s;ident giving a copy of the an&s;wer to the &s;ecretary of Con|gre&s;s, he pre&s;ented it to the mini&s;ter. The pre&s;ident, the Congre&s;s, and the mini&s;ter then ro&s;e together; the mini&s;ter bowed to the pre&s;ident, who returned the &s;alute, and then to the Congre&s;s, who al&s;o bowed in their turn; and the mini&s;ter having bowed to the pre&s;ident, and received his bow, he withdrew, and was attended home in the &s;ame manner in which he had been conducted to the audience.</P>
<P>Within the bar of the hou&s;e the Congre&s;s formed a &s;emi-circle on each &s;ide of the pre&s;ident and the mini&s;ter; the pre&s;ident &s;itting at one extremity of the circle, at a table upon a platform elevated two &s;teps; the mini&s;ter &s;itting at the oppo&s;ite extremity of the circle, in an arm chair, upon the &s;ame level with the Congre&s;s. The door of the Congre&s;s Chamber be|ing thrown open, below the bar, about 200 gentle|men were admitted to the audience, among whom were the vice-pre&s;ident of the Supreme Executive Council of Penn&s;ylvania, the Supreme Executive Coun|cil, the &s;peaker, and members of the Hou&s;e of A&s;|&s;embly, &s;everal foreigners of di&s;tinction and officers of the army. The audience being over, the Con|gre&s;s and the mini&s;ter, at a proper hour, repaired to an entertainment, given by the Congre&s;s to the mini|&s;ter;
<PB N="523" REF="533">at which were pre&s;ent, by invitation, &s;everal foreigners of di&s;tinction, and gentlemen of public character. The entertainment was conducted with a decorum &s;uited to the occa&s;ion, and gave great &s;atis|faction to the whole company.</P>

<P>According to order, the Hon.

<P>Very dear great Friends and Allies.</P>
<P>The treaties which we have &s;igned with you, in con|&s;equence of the propo&s;als your commi&s;&s;ioners made to us in your behalf, are a certain a&s;&s;urance of our af|fection for the United States in general, and for each of them in particular, as well as of the intere&s;t we take, and con&s;tantly &s;hall take, in their happine&s;s and pro&s;perity. It is to convince you more particularly of this, that we have nominated the Sieur Gerard, &s;ecretary of our Council of State, to re&s;ide among you in the quality of our mini&s;ter and plenipotentiary: he is the better acquainted with our &s;entiments to|wards you, and the more capable of te&s;tifying the &s;ame to you, as he was entru&s;ted on our part to negotiate with your commi&s;&s;ioners, and &s;igned with them the treaties which cement our union. We pray you to give credit to all he &s;hall communicate to you from us, more e&s;pecially when he &s;hall a&s;&s;ure you of our affection and con&s;tant friend&s;hip for you. We pray
<PB N="524" REF="534">God, very great Friends and Allies, to have you in his holy keeping.</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>Your good Friend and Ally, (Signed) LOUIS.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>The mini&s;ter was then announced to the pre&s;ident and the Hou&s;e, whereupon he aro&s;e and addre&s;&s;ed Congre&s;s, in the &s;peech, which, when he had fini&s;h|ed, his &s;ecretary delivered the &s;ame in writing to the Pre&s;ident as follows:</P>
<P>Gentlemen,</P>
<P>The connection formed by the King my Ma&s;ter, with the United States of America is &s;o agreeable to him, that he could no longer delay &s;ending me to re|&s;ide among you, for the purpo&s;e of executing it. It will give his Maje&s;ty great &s;atisfaction to learn, that the &s;entiments which have &s;hone forth on this occa|&s;ion, ju&s;tify that confidence with which he hath been in&s;pired by the zeal and character of the United States, in France, the wi&s;dom and fortitude which have directed the re&s;olutions of Congre&s;s, and the courage and per&s;everance of the people they repre|&s;ent; a confidence which you know, Gentlemen, has been the ba&s;is of that truly amicable, and di&s;|intere&s;ted &s;y&s;tem, on which he hath treated with the United States.</P>
<P>It is not his Maje&s;ty's fault that the engagements he hath entered into, did not e&s;tabli&s;h your indepen|dency and repo&s;e, without the further effu&s;ion of blood, and without aggravating the calamities of mankind, who&s;e happine&s;s it is his highe&s;t ambition to promote and &s;ecure. But &s;ince the ho&s;tile mea&s;ures and de&s;igns of the common enemy have given to en|gagements, purely eventual, an immediate, per&s;ua&s;ive, permanent, and indi&s;&s;oluble force, it is the opinion of
<PB N="525" REF="535">the King my ma&s;ter, that the allies &s;hould turn their whole attention to fulfil tho&s;e engagements in the manner mo&s;t u&s;eful to the common cau&s;e, and be&s;t calculated to obtain that peace which is the object of the alliance.</P>
<P>It is upon this principle his maje&s;ty has ha&s;tened to &s;end you a powerful a&s;&s;i&s;tance, which you owe only to his friend&s;hip, to the &s;acred regard he has for every thing which relates to the advantage of the United States, and to his de&s;ire of contributing, with efficacy, to e&s;tabli&s;h your repo&s;e and pro&s;perity, upon an ho|nourable and &s;olid foundation. And farther, it is his expectation, that principles, which may be adopted by the re&s;pective governments, will tend to &s;trengthen tho&s;e bonds of union, which have originated in the mutual intere&s;t of the two nations.</P>
<P>The principal object of my in&s;tructions is to connect the intere&s;ts of France with tho&s;e of the United States. I flatter my&s;elf, gentlemen, that my pa&s;t con|duct in the affairs which concern them, hath already convinced you of the determination I feel to endea|vour to obey my in&s;tructions, in &s;uch manner as to de&s;erve the confidence of Congre&s;s, the friend&s;hip of its members, and the e&s;teem of the citizens of America.</P>
<P>To this Speech the pre&s;ident was plea&s;ed to re|turn the following an&s;wer:</P>
<P>SIR,</P>
<P>The treaties between his Mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ty and the United States, &s;o fully demon&s;trates his wi&s;|dom and magnanimity, as to command the reverence of all nations. The virtuous citizens of America in particular, can never forget his beneficent attention to their violated rights; nor cea&s;e to acknowledge the hand of a gracious providence, in rai&s;ing them up &s;o
<PB N="526" REF="536">powerful and illu&s;trious a friend. It is the hope and opinion of Congre&s;s, that the confidence his maje&s;ty repo&s;es, in the firmne&s;s of the&s;e States, will receive additional &s;trength from every day's experience. The A&s;&s;embly are convinced, Sir, that had it re&s;ted &s;olely with the Mo&s;t Chri&s;tian King, not only the indepen|dence of the&s;e States would have been univer&s;ally ac|knowledged, but their tranquillity fully e&s;tabli&s;hed. We lament the lu&s;t of domination which gave birth to the pre&s;ent war, and hath prolonged and extended the mi&s;eries of mankind. We ardently wi&s;h to &s;heath the &s;word, and &s;pare the further effu&s;ion of blood; but we are determined, by every means in our power, to fulfil tho&s;e eventual engagements, which have ac|quired po&s;itive and permanent force from the ho&s;tile de&s;igns and mea&s;ures of the common enemy. Con|gre&s;s have rea&s;on to believe, that the a&s;&s;i&s;tance &s;o wi&s;ely and generou&s;ly &s;ent, will bring Great Britain to a &s;en&s;e of ju&s;tice and moderation, promote the com|mon intere&s;t of France and America, and &s;ecure peace and tranquility on the mo&s;t firm and honour|able foundation. Neither can it be doubted, that tho&s;e who admini&s;ter the powers of government within the &s;everal States of this union, will cement that connection with the &s;ubjects of France, the beneficial effects of which have already been &s;o &s;en&s;ibly felt. Sir, from the experience we had, of your exertions to promote the true intere&s;ts of our country, as well as your own, it is with the highe&s;t &s;atisfaction, Congre&s;s receive, as the fir&s;t mini&s;ter from his Mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ty, a gentleman, who&s;e pa&s;t conduct affords a happy pre&s;age, that he will merit the confidence of this body, the friend&s;hip of its members, and the e&s;|teem of the citizens of America. The &s;ecretary of
<PB N="527" REF="537">the Congre&s;s then delivered to the mini&s;ter a copy of this reply: whereupon the mini&s;ter withdrew, and was conducted in the manner in which he was brought to the hou&s;e.</P>
<P>The whole management in this affair plainly &s;hew|ed that the Congre&s;s under&s;tood their bu&s;ine&s;s, and had &s;ufficient addre&s;s to receive a French mini&s;ter, as well as to flatter the vanity of his ma&s;ter; they &s;aid nothing mean or what was beneath their character, or that of the Mo&s;t Independent States, and expre&s;&s;ed a greatne&s;s of mind in mid&s;t of calamities, which would have done honour to the antient Romans. It will be proper here to give &s;ome account of the eventual alli|ance which was the foundation of this formal intro|duction of a French mini&s;ter into the American Con|gre&s;s. Our mini&s;try were fully warned that this treaty was going on before it was concluded, and had it in their power to have prevented it, to the advan|tage of their &s;overeign and the intere&s;t of the nation. But the fooli&s;h idea of etiquette and a fal&s;e notion of honour, prevented them from &s;aving thou&s;ands of in|nocent lives, and millions of trea&s;ure to Great Bri|tain. To yield to the colonies, whom they had &s;o un|ju&s;tly injured, and give up the golden dream they had been indulging for &s;o long a time, was an idea they could not at all reli&s;h. They knew that any perma|nent agreement with America, could not be made while they continued in office, becau&s;e America could never tru&s;t them who had &s;o wantonly and cruelly &s;pilt her be&s;t blood, and ravaged her towns in the mo&s;t barbarous manner. To give up their offices was to give up the emoluments that attended them, which was much dearer unto men of their character, than ei|ther the honour of their &s;overeign or the happine&s;s
<PB N="528" REF="538">of the empire. Though they knew of the French treaty, they &s;uffered it to go on without acquainting parliament till it was fini&s;hed, and then they propo&s;ed a plan of reconciliation which the renowned knight of La Mancha would have been a&s;hamed of. They propo&s;ed to the coloni&s;ts to break their faith with France in the fir&s;t public treaty that ever they made, and expo&s;e them&s;elves to all the world as the mo&s;t faithle&s;s of mortals. This, the knew, could not be complied with, and of con&s;equence they would keep their places and continue the war. They had al&s;o &s;ome friends to &s;erve, and the office of commi&s;&s;ioner was a lucrative employment. Even this commi&s;&s;ion was put into the hands of men the mo&s;t unlikely to gain credit in America: A young nobleman of little experience, who was never remarkable in managing his own affairs with honour to him&s;elf, was placed fir&s;t in a commi&s;&s;ion to &s;ettle the difference between Britain and her colonies. To this beau of a noble|man, was joined, an apo&s;tate patriot, a general of the army, and a pettifogging lawyer, who was remarkable for nothing but in being a pen&s;ioner and a pliant voter on the &s;ide of the mini&s;try. To all the&s;e was added, as a &s;ecretary, a Scotch profe&s;&s;or of moral philo&s;ophy, who left his &s;chool, and his &s;cholars, to the care of another, to cro&s;s the Atlantic under the pretence of procuring peace, but in reality to glean &s;ome of tho&s;e benefits which the bounty of government was now &s;o ready to be&s;tow. Among the whole, it is doubtful, though their characters had been more re&s;pectable, whether there was as much judgment as was nece&s;|&s;ary to execute a commi&s;&s;ion of &s;o great importance. It was certainly an affront to the nation, and a di&s;credit to the commi&s;&s;ion, that it was left to the ma|nagement

<PB N="529" REF="540">of the <HI>needy,</HI> the <HI>covetous,</HI> and the <HI>vain.</HI> It was certainly believed by the contrivers of this plan of reconciliation, that it could not &s;ucceed, and was ne|ver meant as a &s;cheme to an&s;wer the o&s;ten&s;ible pur|po&s;e. It even did not an&s;wer that de&s;ign for which it &s;eems to have been principally intended, namely, of fixing upon the coloni&s;ts the charge of being, from the beginning, determined upon independency on Great Britain. The nature of the commi&s;&s;ion, as well as the method in which it was managed, plainly &s;hewed, that dominion and not public utility was the great &s;pring of all our public actions. The de&s;perate principles contained in the manife&s;to publi&s;hed by the commi&s;&s;ioners, fully declared, that the dominion of Britain was of more con&s;equence than all the revenue of America and the lives of near three millions of &s;ubjects. It is almo&s;t the ca&s;e with all men, that tho&s;e who commit an injury, can never forgive tho&s;e they injure: for the principle of wickedne&s;s which determines them to behave injuriou&s;ly, pu&s;hes them on to proceed, and they can find no end but in the total ruin of tho&s;e who re&s;i&s;t their malevolence. Had not our mini&s;try been infatuated in their mea&s;ures with their own folly, and re&s;olutely bent, at all events, upon pur&s;uing their fatal &s;cheme, they would have propo&s;ed their reconciliation before the French treaty; and there is good rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e that, provided the faith of the nation had been properly given for the fulfillment of the &s;cheme, it would have been li&s;tened to, and put an end to the war. The French court improved the opportunity and we lo&s;t it, it is to be feared, for ever. For it does not appear very probable that Great Britain, in her pre&s;ent re|duced
<PB N="530" REF="541">&s;tate of finance, will ever be able to force A|merica into dependence, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by both France and Spain. A view of the treaty, which the colonies have entered into with France, will &s;hew how hope|le&s;s an opinion it is to imagine that Britain can regain her &s;upremacy over America. This treaty is called A Treaty of Alliance, eventual and defen&s;ive, between his Mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ty Louis the Sixteenth, King of France and Navarre, and the Thirteen United States of America; and con&s;i&s;ts of twelve articles. The introduction mentions the &s;everal States particu|larly, which enter into this alliance, and the &s;everal rea&s;ons for &s;o doing, and is perhaps as well expre&s;&s;ed as any deed of the &s;ame nature that has appeared con|cerning any public tran&s;action for &s;ome ages pa&s;t. The tenor of it follows:</P>
<P>The mo&s;t Chri&s;tian King, and the United States of North America, to wit, New Hamp&s;hire, Ma&s;&s;achu|&s;etts Bay, Rhode-I&s;land, Connecticut, New Jer&s;ey, Penn&s;ylvania, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia, having this day concluded a treaty of amity and commerce, for the reciprocal advantage of their &s;ubjects and citizens, have thought it nece&s;&s;ary to take into con&s;ideration the means of &s;trengthening tho&s;e engagements, and of rendering them u&s;eful to the &s;afety and tranquillity of the two parties; particularly in ca&s;e Great Britain in re&s;entment of that connection, which is the object of the &s;aid treaty, &s;hould break the peace with France, either by direct ho&s;tilities, or by hindering her commerce and navigation, in a manner contrary to the rights of nations, and the peace &s;ub&s;i&s;ting be|tween the two crowns.&mdash;And his Maje&s;ty and the
<PB N="531" REF="542">&s;aid United States having re&s;olved, in that ca&s;e, to join their councils and efforts again&s;t the enterprizes of their common enemy, the re&s;pective plenipoten|tiaries, empowered to concert the clau&s;es and condi|tions proper to fulfil the &s;aid intentions, have, after the mo&s;t mature deliberation, concluded and deter|mined on the following articles:</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM><LABEL>ART. I.</LABEL> If war &s;hould break out between France and Great Britain, during the continuance of the pre&s;ent war between the United States and England, his Maje&s;ty and the &s;aid United States, &s;hall make it a common cau&s;e, and aid each other mutually with their good offices, their councils, and their forces, accord|ing to the exigency of conjunctures, as becomes good and faithful allies.</ITEM>
<ITEM><LABEL>ART. II.</LABEL> The e&s;&s;ential and direct end of the pre&s;ent defen|&s;ive alliance is, to maintain effectually the liberty, &s;o|vereignty, and independence, ab&s;olute and unlimited, of the &s;aid United States, as well in matters of go|vernment as of commerce.</ITEM>
<ITEM><LABEL>ART. III.</LABEL> The two contracting parties &s;hall, each on its own part, and in the manner it may judge mo&s;t proper, make all the efforts in its power again&s;t its common enemy, in order to attain the end propo&s;ed.</ITEM>
<ITEM><LABEL>ART. IV.</LABEL> The contracting parties agree, that in ca&s;e either of them &s;hould form a particular enterprize, in which the concurrence of the other may be be de&s;ired, the party who&s;e concurrence is de&s;ired, &s;hall readily and with faith, join to act in concert for that purpo&s;e, as
<PB N="532" REF="543">far as circum&s;tances and its own particular &s;ituation will permit, and in that ca&s;e, they &s;hall regulate, by a par|ticular convention, the quantity and kind of &s;uccour to be furni&s;hed, and the time and manner of its being brought into action, as well as the advantages which are to be its compen&s;ation.</ITEM>
<ITEM><LABEL>ART. V.</LABEL> If the United States &s;hould think fit to attempt the reduction of the Briti&s;h power remaining in the Northern parts of America, or the i&s;lands of Bermu|das, tho&s;e countries or i&s;lands, in ca&s;e of &s;ucce&s;s, &s;hall be confederated with, and dependent upon, the &s;aid United States.</ITEM>
<ITEM><LABEL>ART. VI.</LABEL> The Mo&s;t Chri&s;tian King renounces, for ever, the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the i&s;lands of Bermudas, as well as of any part of the continent of America, which, before the treaty of Paris, 1763, or in virtue of that treaty, were acknowledged to belong to the Crown of Great Britain, or to the United States, heretofore called Briti&s;h colonies, or which are at this time, or have lately been, under the power of the King of Great Britain.</ITEM>
<ITEM><LABEL>ART. VII.</LABEL> If his Mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ty &s;hall think proper to attack any of the i&s;lands &s;ituated in the Gulph of Mexico, or near that Gulph, which are at pre&s;ent under the power of Great Britain, all the &s;aid i&s;les, in ca&s;e of &s;ucce&s;s, &s;hall appertain to the Court of France.</ITEM>
<ITEM><LABEL>ART. VIII.</LABEL> Neither of the two parties &s;hall conclude either truce or peace with Great Britain, without the
<PB N="533" REF="544">formal con&s;ent of the other fir&s;t obtained, and they mutually engage not to lay down their arms, until the independence of the United States &s;hall have been formally and tacitly a&s;&s;ured by treaty or treaties that &s;hall terminate the war.</ITEM>
<ITEM><LABEL>ART. IX.</LABEL> The contracting parties declare, that being re&s;ol|ved to fulfil, each on its own part, the clau&s;es and conditions of the pre&s;ent treaty of alliance, according to its own power and circum&s;tances; there &s;hall be no after claims or compen&s;ation, on one &s;ide or the other, whatever may be the event of the war.</ITEM>
<ITEM><LABEL>ART. X.</LABEL> The Mo&s;t Chri&s;tian King and the United States agree to invite or admit other powers, who may have received injuries from England, to make a common cau&s;e with them, and to accede to the pre&s;ent alliance, under &s;uch conditions as &s;hall be fully agreed to and &s;ettled between all parties.</ITEM>
<ITEM><LABEL>ART. XI.</LABEL> The two parties guarantee mutually, from the pre|&s;ent and for ever, again&s;t all other powers, to wit, the United States to his Mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ty the pre|&s;ent po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of the Crown of France in America, as well as tho&s;e &s;he may acquire, by the future treaty of peace; and his Mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ty guarantees, on his part, to the United States, their liberty, &s;o|vereignty, and independence, ab&s;olute and unlimited, as well matters of government as of commerce, and al&s;o their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, and the additions or conque&s;ts their confederations may obtain during the war, from any of the dominions now or hereafter po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by Great Britain in North America; conformable to the

<ITEM><LABEL>ART. XII.</LABEL> In order to fix more preci&s;ely, the &s;en&s;e and ap|plication of the preceding article, the contracting par|ties declare, that in ca&s;e of a rupture between France and England, the reciprocal guarantee declared in the &s;aid article, &s;hall have its full force and effect the moment the &s;aid war &s;hall break out; and if &s;uch rupture &s;hall not take place, the mutual obligations of the &s;aid guarantees &s;hall not commence until the moment of the ce&s;&s;ation of the pre&s;ent war between the United States and England, &s;hall have a&s;certained their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions.</ITEM>
<ITEM><LABEL>ART. XIII.</LABEL> The pre&s;ent treaty &s;hall be ratified on both &s;ides, and the ratification &s;hall be exchanged within the &s;pace of &s;ix months, or &s;ooner if po&s;&s;ible.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>This is the famous treaty between France and the Coloni&s;ts, to which the latter were driven by the per|ver&s;e pride and &s;tupidity of men who, in&s;tead of being qualified for governing an empire, appear not fit to be tru&s;ted with the charge of a herd of the vile&s;t ani|mals. It might ea&s;ily have been perceived that a mea&s;ure of this kind would be the i&s;&s;ue of the vio|lence and tyranny of Great Britain towards the Co|lonies.</P>
<P>Though this alliance appears unnatural, as being an union of papi&s;ts and prote&s;tants again&s;t a govern|ment which bears the name of prote&s;tant, yet the urgent nece&s;&s;ity of the ca&s;e, and the palpable tyranny
<PB N="535" REF="546">of the Briti&s;h mini&s;try, ju&s;tify the expedient on the part of the coloni&s;ts. It was certainly incon&s;i&s;tent in any prote&s;tant power to employ &s;uch a tyranny again&s;t its own &s;ubjects, as that which the Engli&s;h employed again&s;t America. The hi&s;tory of &s;avage nations does not furni&s;h us with examples more bruti&s;h and barbarous than &s;ome that are &s;aid to have been made on the coa&s;ts of America. It is a matter of the mo&s;t &s;erious con&s;ideration to all Chri&s;tian nations, whether a government, that is &s;aid to be from God, can ever be exerci&s;ed and applied to the de&s;truction of the governed, except when their crimes are &s;uch as ad|mit of no di&s;pute, but are &s;elf-evident. The human under&s;tanding cannot well conceive, that men's lives &s;hould be take away by interpretations of laws which have always been, in the eye of rea&s;on, of a doubtful nature. The American war, and all the blood&s;hed and lo&s;s that has attended it, have had no other foundation than certain inferences of &s;tate, drawn from modern in&s;titutes, not con&s;i&s;tent with the e&s;&s;ential laws of the empire.</P>
<P>Such as pur&s;ue political quarrels for the &s;ake of do|minion &s;o far as to &s;hed blood, it is of &s;mall con&s;e|quence whether they are papi&s;ts or prote&s;tants; for it is certain that they, in that ca&s;e, not only act incon|&s;i&s;tent with the Chri&s;tian religion, but with the fir&s;t principles of all moral laws. The coloni&s;ts have no good rea&s;on, from the known principles of the French, to put much confidence in them, and if they be wi&s;e they will be upon their guard, and watch them care|fully. But in their pre&s;ent &s;ituation it could be no criminal action to emancipate them&s;elves from tyranny, by any lawful means, though the in&s;truments might
<PB N="536" REF="547">not be &s;uch as they altogether approved. The treaty is altogether political, and depends upon certain mu|tual good offices, which whoever fails in are guilty of a breach of faith. With regard to the French being papi&s;ts our government can have no handle, &s;eeing they them&s;elves have e&s;tabli&s;hed popery in one part of their dominions, and have &s;hewn a good inclination to have it introduced into all the re&s;t. The Americans have been reproached for entering into a treaty with the French, again&s;t their king and coun|try; but this reproach falls doubly upon the heads of tho&s;e who rendered their king and their country aliens to them, by denying them the common rights of &s;ubjects, and pro&s;ecuting them with fire and &s;word, becau&s;e they claimed tho&s;e common rights which all Briti&s;h &s;ubjects claim, and to which they have a con|&s;titutional title. In &s;ome after time men will judge more impartially of the nature of this di&s;pute, and will perhaps conclude that the French nation, in&s;tead of doing an unju&s;t action in a&s;&s;i&s;ting America, have done a righteous and humane deed in a&s;&s;i&s;ting the oppre&s;&s;ed. We may call them our enemies on that account, but provided they do us no more injury, we will have no ju&s;t rea&s;on to complain. There is &s;ome|thing ab&s;urd in the opinion of tho&s;e who wi&s;h well to America, and at the &s;ame time are for doing all the mi&s;chief po&s;&s;ible to the French; for unle&s;s the a&s;&s;i&s;tance which France has given America, &s;he has done no manner of injury to us. There is not much rea&s;on to put confidence in the French nation, more than in any other papi&s;ts, but there is truly no rea|&s;on to put confidence in any princes at all, or nations where policy is the only rule of duty. Hi&s;tory has
<PB N="537" REF="548">undoubtedly a right to &s;et forth the &s;tate of facts, that future times may know the ju&s;tice or inju&s;tice, as well as the rea&s;ons, of the war.</P>
<P>While this war was &s;till going on, the nation in general felt the baneful effects of it, and complaints were uttered throughout all the empire, from the effects it had upon all ranks of people. Even tho&s;e who were mo&s;t violent for carrying it on complained of its effects, and confe&s;&s;ed the na|tion would be ruined; while either the wickedne&s;s of their own hearts, or a fal&s;e notion of etiquette and honour, made them rather de&s;ire to ruin them&s;elves and the nation, than not obtain the ruin of the Ame|ricans, whom they &s;o mortally hated. Their con|&s;tant language was, the colonies mu&s;t be &s;ubdued; we have pa&s;&s;ed the rubicon, and cannot go back with|out &s;hame and di&s;grace. Thus, under the &s;evere&s;t apprehen&s;ion of de&s;truction in proceeding, the con|ductors of the war, without hope, &s;till went, till all the corners of the empire, cried out of oppre&s;&s;ion, from one end to the other. Except tho&s;e who were daily living upon the ruins of the public, all parties were loudly complaining of di&s;tre&s;s, with regard to trade, commerce, and every article of bu&s;ine&s;s. Tho&s;e who were the be&s;t judges of the di&s;tre&s;&s;es concerning trade and commerce, and who expre&s;&s;ed their &s;entiments in the warme&s;t, and at the &s;ame time, in the mo&s;t decent manner, were but little re|garded by the highe&s;t authority of the nation, who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s it was to have more e&s;pecially con&s;idered the rea&s;ons of tho&s;e complaints. The &s;en&s;e of the whole nation was this year well expre&s;&s;ed in the addre&s;s and petition of the commons of the city of London
<PB N="538" REF="549">a&s;&s;embled in common council, which was pre&s;ented to his Maje&s;ty upon March 13, this year. The ad|dre&s;s and his maje&s;ty's an&s;wer, will better expre&s;s the temper of the nation and the di&s;po&s;ition of the government than any that might be &s;ub&s;tituted in their place.</P>
<P>We, your maje&s;ty's mo&s;t dutiful and loyal &s;ubjects, the lord mayor, aldermen, and commons of the city of London, in common council a&s;&s;embled, attached to your maje&s;ty's royal hou&s;e by principle, to your per|&s;on by the true&s;t affection, and to the honour and pro&s;perity of your government, by every intere&s;t that can be dear to the heart of man; in this pre&s;ent de|plorable &s;tate of the affairs of this once great and flouri&s;hing country, with mo&s;t profound humility, implore leave to lay our&s;elves at your maje&s;ty's feet, to repre&s;ent to your maje&s;ty the &s;entiments and wi&s;hes of a faithful and afflicted people.</P>
<P>When this civil war was fir&s;t threatened, your loyal city of London, in concurrence with the &s;en&s;e of many other re&s;pectable bodies of your kingdom, and many of the wi&s;e&s;t and be&s;t of your &s;ubjects, did mo&s;t hum|bly deprecate this evil, forboding, but too truly, the charges, calamities, and di&s;graces, of which it has hi|therto been productive, and the great di&s;tre&s;&s;es to which it is &s;till likely to &s;ubject this kingdom: Your faithful people, on that occa&s;ion, had the misfortune to receive from your maje&s;ty, an an&s;wer, more &s;uit|able to the imperfect manner in which (they fear) they expre&s;&s;ed &s;entiments full of duty, than your ma|je&s;ty's own mo&s;t gracious di&s;po&s;ition, their inviolable reverence to their &s;overeign, and their un&s;haken zeal for his glory. They retired in a mournful and re&s;pect|ful
<PB N="539" REF="550">&s;ilence, patiently waiting the di&s;po&s;ition of provi|dence, and the return of your maje&s;ty's favour and countenance, whenever experience &s;hould fully di&s;|clo&s;e, in its true light, the well-founded nature of their apprehen&s;ions and the fatal tendency of tho&s;e councils by which the nation has been mi&s;led.</P>
<P>For, mi&s;led and deceived, your maje&s;ty, and many of your &s;ubjects, have been. No pains have been omitted, to hide from both the true nature of the bu|&s;ine&s;s in which we were engaged; no arts have been left untried, to &s;timulate the pa&s;&s;ions of your &s;ubjects in this kingdom; and we are confident that infi|nitely more &s;kill and attention have been u&s;ed to en|gage us in this war, than have been employed to conduct it to honour or advantage, if honour or ad|vantage could be obtained by any conduct in &s;uch a war.</P>
<P>We have been indu&s;triou&s;ly taught to &s;u&s;pect the profe&s;&s;ions, and to de&s;pi&s;e the re&s;i&s;tance, of our bre|thren, (Engli&s;hmen like our&s;elves) whom we had no &s;ort of rea&s;on to think deficient in the &s;incerity and courage which have ever di&s;tingui&s;hed that name and race. Their inclinations have been mi&s;repre&s;ented, their natural faculties depreciated, their re&s;ources mi&s;-calculated, their feelings in&s;ulted, until fury and de&s;pair &s;upplied whatever might be defective in force. We have &s;een a whole army, the flower of the train|ed military &s;trength of Great Britain and her allies, fami&s;hed in the wilderne&s;s of America, lay down their arms, and owing their immediate re&s;cue from death to tho&s;e very men whom the murders and rapines of the &s;avages, (unhappily employed) had forced from hu&s;bandmen into &s;oldiers, and who had been painted
<PB N="540" REF="551">in &s;uch colours of contempt as to take away all con&s;o|lation from our calamity. We have &s;een another army, equally brave, and equally well commanded, for two years in an almo&s;t continued cour&s;e of victory, by which they have only wa&s;ted their own numbers, without decrea&s;ing the &s;trength of the re&s;i&s;ting power, without leading to any &s;ort of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, or bringing to your maje&s;ty's obedience, even the &s;malle&s;t and weake&s;t of thirteen revolted colonies. The union of tho&s;e provinces among&s;t them&s;elves, and their animo|&s;ity to your maje&s;ty's admini&s;tration, have only been encrea&s;ed, by the injudicious methods taken, to break the one and &s;ubdue the other. Fleets and armies are maintained, in numbers almo&s;t equal, and at an ex|pence comparatively far &s;uperior, to what ever has been employed in the mo&s;t glorious, and mo&s;t &s;ucce&s;s|ful &s;truggles of this country, again&s;t a combination of the mo&s;t formidable monarchies of Europe. A few incon&s;iderable detached i&s;lands, and one de&s;erted town on the continent, where your maje&s;ty's combined army has a perilous and in&s;ecure footing, are the only fruits of an expence exceeding twenty millions, of ninety-three &s;hips of war, and &s;ixty thou&s;and of the be&s;t &s;oldiers which could be procured either at home or abroad, and appointed for that &s;pecial &s;ervice. Your maje&s;ty's forces, both by &s;ea and land, have, we are told, done all that could be expected from the mo&s;t accompli&s;hed di&s;cipline, and the mo&s;t determined courage; and yet the total defeat of &s;ome of the&s;e forces, and the ineffectual victories of others, have al|mo&s;t equally con&s;pired to the de&s;truction of your power, and the di&s;memberment of your empire. We &s;hould be unpardonably negligent of our duty to your
<PB N="541" REF="552">maje&s;ty, to our&s;elves, and to our country, if we did not thus &s;olemnly expre&s;s our feelings upon this dreadful and deci&s;ive proof of the madne&s;s with which this attempt was originally made, and which faithfully following it through every &s;tep of its progre&s;s, and every mea&s;ure for its execution, has completed, by uniform mi&s;conduct, the mi&s;chiefs which were com|menced in total ignorance. We are convinced that, not the delu&s;ions of artful and de&s;igning men, (which, like every thing fal&s;e, cannot be permanent) but the general &s;en&s;e of the whole American people, is &s;et and determined again&s;t the plans of coertion, civil and mi|litary, which have been hitherto employed again&s;t them. A whole, united, and irritated people cannot be conquered. If the force now employed cannot do it, no force within our abilities will do it.</P>
<P>The wealth of this nation is great, and our di&s;po&s;i|tion would be to pour it out with the mo&s;t unre&s;erved and cheerful liberality, for the &s;upport of the honour and dignity of your crown: but dome&s;tic peace and dome&s;tic oeconomy are the only means of &s;upplying expence for war abroad. In this conte&s;t our re&s;our|ces are exhau&s;ted, whil&s;t tho&s;e of our rivals are &s;pared, and we are, every year of the continuance of this war, altering the balance of our public &s;trength and riches in their favour.</P>
<P>We think our&s;elves bound, mo&s;t dread Sovereign, to expre&s;s our fears and apprehen&s;ions to your maje&s;|ty, that, at a time when your maje&s;ty's gracious &s;peech from the throne has hinted, and your va&s;t naval preparations in a &s;tyle much more explicit, an|nounced to us and the world, the critical &s;tate in which we &s;tand with regard to the great neighbouring
<PB N="542" REF="553">powers, we have not the comfort to learn, from that &s;peech, from any a&s;&s;urance of your maje&s;ty's &s;er|vants, or even from common fame, that any alliance whatever has been made with the other great &s;tates of Europe, in order to cover us from the complicated perils &s;o manife&s;tly imminent over this nation. We have as little rea&s;on to be certain that alliances of the mo&s;t dangerous kind are not formed again&s;t us.</P>
<P>In this &s;tate of anxious doubt and danger, we have recour&s;e to the clemency and wi&s;dom of your ma|je&s;ty, the tender parent and valiant guardian of your people, that you will graciou&s;ly take &s;uch mea&s;ures as may re&s;tore internal peace, and (as far as the mi&s;erable circum&s;tances into which the late de&s;tructive cour&s;es have brought us will permit) re-unite the Briti&s;h na|tion, in &s;ome happy, honourable, and permanent con|junction, le&s;t the colonies, exa&s;perated by rigours of continuance of war, &s;hould become totally alienated from their parent country; le&s;t every remaining &s;park of their affection &s;hould be extingui&s;hed, in ha|bits of mutual &s;laughter and rapine; and le&s;t in &s;ome evil hour, they who have been the great &s;upport of the Briti&s;h &s;trength, &s;hould become the mo&s;t formida|ble and la&s;ting acce&s;&s;ion to the con&s;tant enemies of the power and pro&s;perity of your kingdoms.</P>
<P>We humbly hope and tru&s;t, that your maje&s;ty will give all due efficacy to the conce&s;&s;ions, (we wi&s;h the&s;e conce&s;&s;ions may not have come too late) which have been propo&s;ed in parliament; and we have that un|doubted reliance on the magnanimity of your maje&s;ty's enlarged and kingly affection, that we are under no apprehen&s;ions of your maje&s;ty being bia&s;&s;ed by pri|vate
<PB N="543" REF="554">partiality to any &s;et of men, in the ca&s;e where the good, where the very being of your people is at &s;take; and with an humble confidence we implore and &s;upplicate your maje&s;ty, that nothing may &s;tand in the way of tho&s;e arrangements, in your councils and executive offices, which may be&s;t forward the great, nece&s;&s;ary, and ble&s;&s;ed work of peace, and which may tend to re&s;cue your affairs from unwi&s;e and improvident management, and which may obtain, improve, and &s;ecure the returning confidence of all your people. In &s;uch mea&s;ures and &s;uch arrange|ments, and for &s;uch ends your citizens of London will never fail to give your maje&s;ty their mo&s;t affectionate and &s;teady &s;upport.</P>
<P>His maje&s;ty's opinion of this war appears to have been very different from that of the citizens of Lon|don, as is evident from his an&s;wer to this Addre&s;s and Petition, which he returned in the following words:</P>
<P>I can never think that the zeal of my &s;ubjects, the re&s;ources of my kingdom, and the bravery of my fleets and armies, can have been unwi&s;ely and impro|vidently employed, when the object was to maintain the con&s;titutional &s;ubordination which ought to pre|vail through the &s;everal parts of my dominions, and is e&s;&s;ential to the pro&s;perity of the whole; but I have always lamented the calamities in&s;eperable from a &s;tate of war; and &s;hall mo&s;t earne&s;tly give all the effi|cacy in my power, to tho&s;e mea&s;ures which the le|gi&s;lature has adopted for the purpo&s;e of re&s;toring, by &s;ome happy, honourable, and permanent conciliation, the ble&s;&s;ing of peace, commerce, affection, and con|fidence, between the mother country and the colo|nies.</P>
<PB N="544" REF="555">
<P>This an&s;wer, though one of the mo&s;t &s;oft and plau&s;ible that had been given for &s;ome time, expre&s;|&s;ed &s;entiments of a very different &s;ignification from tho&s;e in the petition. The idea of con&s;titutional &s;ub|ordination, in the royal dialect, has a different mean|ing from what the citizens of London under&s;tood by &s;ubordination. The &s;ubduing the coloni&s;ts to the will of parliament, which was the &s;ame with the will of the mini&s;ter, was the royal idea of con&s;titutional &s;ubordination; but the citizens &s;uppo&s;ed that there were &s;ome things which had received the authority of the legi&s;lature, that were directly contrary to the con&s;titution, and that &s;ome modern &s;tatutes were di|rectly &s;ubver&s;ive of the antient laws of the land, and contrary to the great charter of the nation. They imagined, as was natural for &s;ober men to do, that ju&s;tice, which is a thing &s;elf-evident, could never cla&s;h with the con&s;titution, but in &s;uch parts as the con&s;titution was either imperfect or erroneous, and that in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e the ju&s;tice of the con&s;titution and the modern acts of the legi&s;lature, were greatly at variance. The coloni&s;ts were pro&s;ecuted with a cruel war for claiming, as their right, what they were entitled to by the con&s;titution, and what Engli&s;hmen at home both claimed and enjoyed: This they thought both unju&s;t and impolitic; and, provided the plain principles of ju&s;tice were ob&s;erved, nothing could ap|pear more unrighteous than the American war. But it is chiefly owing to a &s;y&s;tem of morals which now &s;eems to be publicly profe&s;&s;ed that ju&s;tice and civil po|licy are &s;et at variance; for &s;ome political writers have of late maintained it as a fir&s;t truth, that the puni&s;hment of &s;ins mentioned in the decalogue do not extend to politics,&mdash;which is the &s;ame thing as to &s;ay
<PB N="545" REF="556">that under the colour of politics men may do what they plea&s;e without being accountable for their ac|tions. Upon this principle our mini&s;try will fairly clear them&s;elves of the guilt of inju&s;tice and blood-&s;hedding in all this cruel and wicked war. But upon this principle it mu&s;t be al&s;o maintained that there is as little crime on one &s;ide as on the other, and that the coloni&s;ts, upon the &s;ame principles of policy, are guiltle&s;s in the whole of their re&s;i&s;tance; &s;o that the pre&s;ent and all other wars, are innocent, harmle&s;s, and political plays, for which no man &s;hall be account|able hereafter. This is a doctrine, &s;o de&s;tructive of all morality, that it is no wonder that its friends pro|ceed from evil to wor&s;e. And truly this principle is the &s;ole ba&s;is of this dreadful and pernicious war. Tho&s;e who think in the old-fa&s;hioned manner, and con&s;ider that all policy ought to be e&s;tabli&s;hed in ho|ne&s;ty, will not &s;oon become pro&s;elytes to &s;uch dan|gerous doctrine. The amount of principles of this fort is, that there is no danger in the world to come, ari&s;ing from any thing that politicians do in this, or rather that there is no after reckoning to be dreaded. If this is the ca&s;e, there is as little good to be hoped for, and therefore tho&s;e who &s;hall think proper, for their own humour or any other rea&s;on, may, with all &s;afety, for any thing that will happen hereafter, pro|vided they can &s;ecure them&s;elves from puni&s;hment in this life, or are willing to &s;uffer it, carry off &s;uch po|liticians in the mo&s;t decent manner they can. In this ca&s;e his maje&s;ty's crown is in a tottering &s;ituation, and his &s;afety very precarious. Tho&s;e pretended friends of the con&s;titution are not even to be tru&s;ted in matters of the &s;malle&s;t con&s;ideration; for it is impo&s;&s;ible they can be faithful beyond the idea of their pre&s;ent pri|vate
<PB N="546" REF="557">intere&s;t. It is impo&s;&s;ible for any good man, but to pity his maje&s;ty, when he is &s;erved by &s;uch unprin|cipled per&s;ons, who, under pretence of being friends, teach his &s;ubjects that there neither is nor can be duty belonging either to God or their lawful &s;ove|reign, beyond the limits of their own private intere&s;t.</P>
<P>When &s;uch doctrines are publicly &s;ent through the country in government new&s;papers, it ought to alarm every lover of his country and king; and the friends of the glorious revolution, ought to watch, with care, every motion of men who give up the fir&s;t principles of all laws and government, to the lu&s;ts of the ambi|tious or the will of the proud. The&s;e tools of wick|edne&s;s and de&s;poti&s;m, think no &s;hame to &s;candalize the be&s;t friends of the Briti&s;h government, and the con&s;titution, and to affirm that there is no more in their profe&s;&s;ions of patrioti&s;m, than to worm them|&s;elves into places of preferment and emolument; but in this they only judge from their own principles and feelings, which di&s;po&s;e them to think that all men are like them&s;elves, and not from any certain lineaments of character in tho&s;e they &s;candalize. From men of &s;uch abandoned principles, has this ungenerous, un|gracious, and baneful war proceeded, and is by them &s;till carried on, which has abridged his maje&s;ty's do|minions, retrenched his revenues, and is likely to en|danger the honour of his family, and that glory with which the Brun&s;wick line might have reigned over one of the large&s;t empires of the world, in peace and &s;afety, for ages to come.</P>
<P>The Americans had now for &s;ome time pa&s;t been meditating to act upon the offen&s;ive as well as upon the defen&s;ive: the notion of the Briti&s;h forces being invincible, was no longer a predominant idea, and the
<PB N="547" REF="558">provincials were now convinced that they could at|tack them in their turn, with great probability of &s;ucce&s;s. Accordingly they attacked and took Fort Independence, which was in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of our army, with very incon&s;iderable lo&s;s. A full account of this tran&s;action has never fully tran&s;pired to Bri|tain, and we are as yet uncertain of the particulars. Many of the accounts received about the end of this year, are very uncertain. The greate&s;t part of them are taken from Rivington's Gazette, which is a paper of no credit, and which cannot be depended upon. The &s;kirmi&s;h near White Mar&s;h, in December this year, was a pretty &s;mart one, and the lo&s;s on both &s;ides is variou&s;ly reported. Our accounts &s;ay that the Americans lo&s;t two hundred men, and their ac|counts do not make ours any le&s;s; by comparing both accounts there appears to have been little ad|vantage gained on either &s;ide, but much blood &s;pilt to little purpo&s;e. As our army could not bring the provincials to any general engagement, nor was it judged prudent to proceed beyond the reach of their &s;hips and armed ve&s;&s;els, they carried on a &s;ort of pre|datory excur&s;ions in certain parts, where they could, by &s;urprize, attack any village where they &s;u&s;pected there were any &s;tores or provi&s;ions fit for carrying on the war. This, by means of the &s;hipping, was not difficult to effect. In the&s;e plundering excur&s;ions they often behaved with &s;uch rigour as was incon&s;i&s;t|ent with that modern profe&s;&s;ion of humanity of car|rying on war among civilized nations. The dwel|lings of inoffen&s;ive pea&s;ants, the hou&s;es of women and children, with churches and places devoted to the wor&s;hip of the Mo&s;t High, fell victims to the fury of the&s;e plundering expeditions. An expedition to
<PB N="548" REF="559">the town of Warren, which was undertaken in the month of May, by Lieutenant Colonel Campbell, may &s;erve as a &s;pecimen of what was to be expected in this late &s;ea&s;on of the year, when winter was coming on and dwellings were now &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to the inha|bitants of that and all other cold countries. This expedition, which was omitted on account of giving place to the &s;ucce&s;&s;ive progre&s;s of the main army, &s;hall be now given in the words of General Pigot, in his letter to Sir Henry Clinton, where the account is particularly accurate in mo&s;t particulars, except in the lo&s;s which our troops &s;u&s;tained in the expedi|tion.</P>
<P>"IN a former letter I had the honour to acquaint you with the arrival of General Sullivan at Provi|dence, to take the command of the troops of this State. You was likewi&s;e informed, that it was the prevailing opinion he was &s;ent there on purpo&s;e to make an attack upon this i&s;land, whenever a conve|nient opportunity offered. Every day &s;ince has af|forded new and &s;ufficient cau&s;e to confirm this &s;u&s;pi|cion; and having procured intelligence that a number of large boats and gallies were a&s;hore on the We&s;t &s;ide of the river, and below Hickamuct bridge, all un|der repair, with a number of cannon and &s;tores, Com|modore Griffith and my&s;elf were of opinion that no time &s;hould be lo&s;t to take advantage of this unguard|ed &s;ituation of the rebels, having certain information that there was only a guard of ten men upon the boats, and not more than 250 men on the whole pen|in&s;ula, from Warren to Bri&s;tol Ferry, and that it was not po&s;&s;ible any con&s;iderable force could be a&s;&s;embled and come to their a&s;&s;i&s;tance before the boats were de&s;troyed, the whole bu&s;ine&s;s fini&s;hed, and the troops
<PB N="549" REF="560">&s;afely re-imbarked. Lieutenant-Colonel Campbell of the 22d regiment, being ordered for this command, with eight battalion companies of the 22d regiment. the flank companies of the 54th regiment, and Capt. Noltenius's company of He&s;&s;ian Cha&s;&s;eurs, the whole making about 500 men, marched the evening of the 24th in&s;t. from Newport to Arnold's Point, where they embarked about 12 o'clock on board the flat-bottom boats, under the direction of Captain Clayton and Lieut. Knowles of the navy; and it is with plea&s;ure I &s;end you the following agreeable report of Col. Campbell's &s;ucce&s;s and proceedings while on this expedition. He has acquainted me that the boats proceeded up the harbour towards Warren River. His Maje&s;ty's &s;hip the Flora moving up the Papa&s;qua&s;h point to cover the operation of the troops, and the other &s;hips changing their &s;tation, &s;o as to give every a&s;&s;i&s;tance in their power. Son after day-break the troops landed undi&s;covered a mile above Bri&s;tol, and three miles below Warren, and Col. Campbell de|tached Capt. Seix, of the 22d regiment, with 30 men, to Papa&s;qua&s;h Point to take and de&s;troy the rebel battery of one 18 pounder, which was ea&s;ily effected, and a captain of artillery and &s;even privates made pri|&s;oners. The main body moved on towards the town of Warren, and, after taking the precaution of e&s;ta|bli&s;hing po&s;ts to &s;ecure the pa&s;&s;es, proceeded to Hick|amuct River, where they found the boats without a guard, or any one to mole&s;t them. They were imme|diately collected in &s;everal heaps, and the whole &s;et fire to, amounting to 125 boats, many of them fifty feet in length. A galley of &s;ix twelve pounders, two &s;loops, one of them loaded with &s;tores, with a quanti|ty of materials for building and repairing, were like|wi&s;e
<PB N="550" REF="561">burnt, as was a mill and a bridge acro&s;s the ri|ver. The guns of the galley, together with three eighteen-pounders, mounted on travelling-carriages, were &s;piked, the trunnions knocked off, and the car|riages burnt. This &s;ervice being effectually perform|ed, the troops returned to Warren. They party of Cha&s;&s;eurs left there had de&s;troyed a park of artillery, con&s;i&s;ting of two 24-pounders, two 18-pounders, and two nine-pounders, mounted on traveling carriages, with &s;ide boxes, ammunition, and &s;ide-arms complete, by &s;piking up the guns, burning the carriages, lim|bers, &amp;c. In the town of Warren they di&s;covered a hou&s;e full of ammunition, combu&s;tibles, and other warlike &s;tores, and &s;ome ca&s;ks of rum, rice, and &s;ugar, which was blown up, and the whole de&s;troyed. A new privateer &s;loop, mounting &s;ixteen four-pounders, and fit for &s;ea, was burnt in Warren River. The town-hou&s;e, church, and &s;everal hou&s;es, were likewi&s;e burnt to the ground. The objects of this enterprize being thus far effected, the troops returned by the way of Bri&s;tol. On the march near Warren, two field-pieces were &s;piked up, and a light three-pound|er, abandoned by the rebels, was rendered u&s;ele&s;s by being &s;piked, and the carriage broken to pieces. Two three-pounders in a redoubt on the road were de&s;troy|ed in the &s;ame manner. In marching through the town of Bri&s;tol, one 18-pounder was &s;piked, and a military &s;tore was blown up, and the church and &s;ome hou&s;es burnt. By this time a party of the re|bels had a&s;&s;embled, and kept up a con&s;tant fire upon our rear from two field-pieces and a number of &s;mall arms, till the troops gained the height above Bri&s;tol Ferry, where they &s;piked up two 18-pounders in the
<PB N="551" REF="562">rebel battery, and then made the &s;ignal for the flat-bottom boats to advance from Papa&s;qua&s;h river. Upon their arrival, the whole detachment embarked with regularity and good order, under cover of our fort on the oppo&s;ite &s;hore, and the Flora man of war and two galleys, (the Pigot and Spitfire) the latter having been taken from the rebels the &s;ame morning by Lieut, Kempthorn, of the Non&s;uch. The rebels ventured to a&s;cend the hill with one field-piece, but not before the troops were all embarked, and the boats at a great di&s;tance from the &s;hore. This e&s;&s;en|tial &s;ervice was performed with very incon&s;iderable lo&s;s; Lieut, Hamilton, of the 22d regiment, four He&s;&s;ian &s;oldiers, and eight Briti&s;h, were wounded, and two drummers mi&s;&s;ing. It is impo&s;&s;ible to a&s;certain the lo&s;s the enemy &s;u&s;tained, but believe it to be of no great moment, for tho' they kept up a heavy fire upon our rear at times, it was always at a great di&s;|tance, under cover of their field pieces, and from be|hind walls, which rendered the fire of our men very uncertain. The following is the number of pri&s;oners taken: one colonel, three field-officers, two captains, two lieutenants, and fifty-eight per&s;ons, mo&s;t of them &s;oldiers, or belonging to the militia.</P>
<P>"The&s;e &s;ucce&s;&s;es of the navy and army, in their &s;everal operations, I hope will convince the rebels that it is in the power of this garri&s;on to annoy, lay wa&s;te, and di&s;tre&s;s their per&s;ons and property, when|ever they are inclined to do &s;o."</P>
<P>In this account there is no rea&s;on a&s;&s;igned for burn|ing the church and the town hou&s;e, and it would ap|pear that it was done through mere wantonne&s;s, or &s;ome particular plea&s;ure that our officers and &s;oldiers
<PB N="552" REF="563">had in de&s;troying places of religious wor&s;hip; for in all the wars that are recorded for the&s;e hundred years pa&s;t, we do not find as many places of wor&s;hip de&s;troyed by armies with de&s;ign, without any &s;uffi|cient rea&s;on, as have been de&s;troyed in this American war.</P>
<P>In another letter from General Pigot there is an account of his burning &s;ome &s;aw-mills, with all the circum&s;tances minutely particularized, which will give &s;ome in&s;ight of the method of carrying on this war. It is dated from Newport, May 31, and is as follows:</P>
<P>"A FEW days ago I had the plea&s;ure of ac|quainting you with Lieut Col. Campbell's &s;ucce&s;s in de&s;troying the rebels &s;hipping, boats, cannon, ma|gazines, &amp;c. and having information that there was a large quantity of boards and planks at Fall River, and the only Saw Mills that are in this part of the country, the commodore and I were of opinion it would be doing great &s;ervice if the whole could be de&s;troyed. To effect which, 100 men of the 54th regiment, com|manded by Major Eyre, embarked la&s;t night in flat-bottom boats at Arnold's Point, having the Pigot gal|ley and &s;ome armed boats for their protection and con|voy; unfortunately the galley got a-ground in pa&s;&s;ing Bri&s;tol Ferry, but the boats proceeded, and arrived a little after day break at the propo&s;ed place for land|ing. They were di&s;covered &s;ome time before they reached the &s;hore, and the &s;ignal alarm was given by the di&s;charge of cannon and &s;mall arms. When the troops-attempted to land, they were fired upon by a &s;trong guard; however the gun-boat &s;oon di&s;per&s;ed them, and they landed and pu&s;hed forwards to two
<PB N="553" REF="564">mills, the one for &s;awing, the other for grain, which were &s;et fire to and entirely con&s;umed, together with a very con&s;iderable quantity of boards and planks for building boats or privateers. The major finding a greater number of men in arms than he expected, and being apprehen&s;ive the oppo&s;ition would increa&s;e, thought in more prudent to retire than advance farther to the other mill, as the chief object of the expedi|tion was an&s;wered, by de&s;troying the principal &s;aw mill, and all the boards and planks. In returning to the boats they &s;et fire to the rebel guard-room, a provi&s;ion &s;tore, and nine cedar-boats; many &s;acks of corn were de&s;troyed in the mills. His lo&s;s was two men killed, and Lieut. Gold&s;mith and four men wound|ed. The rebels lo&s;s is thought to be more con&s;ider|able. When the tide made, the galley got afloat; but in towing her off, Lieutenant Congleton, of the Flora man of war, was much wounded, and two men unfortunately killed. I have great plea&s;ure in ac|quainting you, that on this expedition the navy and army behaved with their u&s;ual &s;pirit and firmne&s;s."</P>
<P>As we have already given a &s;hort account of Gen. Sullivan's retreat from Rhode I&s;land, it may be ne|ce&s;&s;ary, for the &s;ake of comparing accounts, to give the reader a view of the antecedent circum&s;tances there|of, in the language of our own generals. General Pigot, in his letter to General Clinton, gives the fol|lowing detail of circum&s;tances:</P>
<P>"THOUGH by &s;everal letters &s;ince the 29th of July la&s;t, more e&s;pecially by that I had the honour of writing by Lieutenant Colonel Stuart, and the accu|racy of his intelligence, your excellency will have been informed of the &s;tate of affairs here to the 28th
<PB N="554" REF="565">in&s;tant; yet, as many of tho&s;e letters, from the uncer|tainty of the communication, may not have reached you, a &s;ummary of the tran&s;actions &s;ince the 29th of July, when the French fleet arrived, to the la&s;t pe|riod, will not be unnece&s;&s;ary, and may help to ex|plain &s;ub&s;equent events.</P>
<P>"From the fir&s;t appearance of the fleet to the 8th in&s;t. our utmo&s;t exertions were directed to removing to places of &s;ecurity the provi&s;ions, ammunition, mili|tary and naval &s;tores, which were either on board &s;hip or on the wharf, preparing a fortified camp, and di&s;|po&s;ing every thing for re&s;i&s;ting the combined attacks of the French and rebels upon us; I immediately withdrew from Conanicut, Brown's provincial corps, and two regiments of An&s;pach, which had been &s;ta|tioned there. The next morning the guns on the Beaver Tail and Dumplin batteries, the former of which was directed with &s;ome effect again&s;t two line of battle &s;hips that entered the Narragan&s;et pa&s;&s;age, were rendered un&s;erviceable, as the fleet entering the harbour would cut off al communication with that i&s;land; of which the French admiral &s;oon took a tem|porary po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and landed the marines of his &s;qua|dron. During this period, from the movements of the French &s;hips in the Beconet on the 30th, the King's Fi&s;her and two gallies were obliged to be &s;et on fire; and afterwards on the 5th in&s;tant, the four advanced frigates, from the approach of two of the enemy's line of battle &s;hips from the Narragan&s;et, were likewi&s;e de&s;troyed, after &s;aving &s;ome of their &s;tores, and &s;ecuring the landing of the &s;eamen.</P>
<P>"When it was evident the French fleet were com|ing into the harbour, it became nece&s;&s;ary to collect our
<PB N="555" REF="566">forces, and withdraw the troops from the north parts of the i&s;land, which was accordingly done that even|ing. I likewi&s;e ordered all the cattle on the i&s;land to be driven within our lines, leaving only one cow with each family, and every carriage and intrenching tool to be &s;ecured, as the only mea&s;ures that could be devi&s;ed to di&s;tre&s;s the rebels, and impede their pro|gre&s;s.</P>
<P>"On the 8th in&s;tant at noon, the French fleet (which, from its appearance, had continued, with lit|tle variation, at anchor about three miles from the mouth of the harbour) got under way, and &s;tanding in under a light &s;ail, kept up a warm fire on Brenton's Point, Goat I&s;land, and the North Batteries, which were manned by &s;eamen of the de&s;troyed frigates, and commanded by Capt. Chri&s;tian, and Lieutenants Forre&s;t and Otway of the navy, who returned the fire with great &s;pirit and in good direction. The la&s;t of the&s;e works had been previou&s;ly &s;trengthened, and &s;ome tran&s;ports &s;unk in its front, as an effectual mea|&s;ure to block up the pa&s;&s;age between it and Ro&s;e-i&s;land.</P>
<P>"The next morning we had the plea&s;ure to &s;ee the Engli&s;h fleet, and I immediately &s;ent on board to communicate to Lord Howe our &s;ituation and that of the enemy. By nine o'clock the following day the French fleet re-pa&s;&s;ed our batteries, and &s;ailed out of the harbour, firing on them as before, and having it returned with equal &s;pirit on our &s;ide. By this can|nonade from the &s;hips on both days, very fortunately not one man was hurt, or any injury done, except to &s;ome hou&s;es in town.</P>
<PB N="556" REF="567">
<P>"I &s;hall now proceed to inform your excellency of the movements of the enemy from the 9th in&s;tant, when they landed at Howland's Ferry.</P>
<P>"The badne&s;s of the weather for &s;ome days mu&s;t have prevented their tran&s;porting of &s;tores, or being in readine&s;s to approach us, as they did not make their appearance near us until the 14th, when a large body took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Honyman's-Hill.</P>
<P>"To repel any attempts from that quarter, a brea&s;t|work was directed to be made along the heights from Green-End to Iri&s;h's Redoubt, which was &s;trengthen|ed by an abbatis.</P>
<P>"On the 17th the enemy was di&s;covered breaking ground on Honyman's Hill, on the &s;ummit of which and on the right of the Green End-Road, they were con&s;tructing a battery. The next day another was commenced by them for five guns to their left, and in a direct line with the former, which was prepared for four. On this day a line of approach was likewi&s;e begun by them from the battery on the right to Green-End-Road, which works we endeavoured to ob&s;truct by keeping a continual fire on them. The 19th the enemy opened their left battery, which obliged our encampment to be removed farther in the rear. This day we began another line, for the greater &s;ecurity of our left, from Iri&s;h's Redoubt to Fomini-Hill; and I directed a battery of one 24 and two 18-pounders to be rai&s;ed on our right brea&s;twork to counteract tho&s;e of the enemy, which was opened the following day, when they were ob&s;erved bu&s;ied in forming a &s;econd approach from the fir&s;t, to a nearer di&s;tance on the road</P>
<PB N="557" REF="568">
<P>"At noon the French fleet again came in view, much di&s;abled and anchored off the port, where it continued till the 22d, when it finally di&s;appeared.</P>
<P>"This day the rebels were con&s;tructing two other batteries, much lower down the hill than the former, one on the right for five, the other on the left of Green-Hill-Road for &s;even guns, both which were opened the next day, when I found it nece&s;&s;ary to attempt &s;ilencing them, and therefore ordered a bat|tery for &s;even heavy guns on commanding ground, near Green-End, which, from the ob&s;tructions given by the enemy's fire, could not be completed till the 25th, when the rebels thought proper to clo&s;e the embra&s;ures of their lower batteries, and make u&s;e of them for mortars. During this time they had been con&s;tructing, on the Height of the Ea&s;t Road, ano|ther for one of 13 inches, and this day began a third approach in front, and to the right of the lower bat|teries.</P>
<P>"The 26th, ob&s;erving the enemy to di&s;continue their works, and learning from de&s;erters they were removing the officers baggage and heavy artillery, I detached Lieut. Col. Bruce, with 100 men of the 54th regiment, in the night, over Eaton's Beach in que&s;t of intelligence, who with great addre&s;s, &s;ur|pri&s;ed and brought off a picquet of two officers and 25 men, without any lo&s;s. Some of Col. Fanning's corps, at different times, exerted them&s;elves in taking off people from the enemy's advanced po&s;ts; but lit|tle intelligence to be depended upon was ever obtain|ed from them; nor were other attempts to procure it, more efficacious, as from all that could be learned, it was doubtful whether their intentions were to attack our lines or retreat</P>

<P>"On the 27th the Sphynx and two other &s;hips of war arrived; and I had the hounour of being informed by Colonel Stuart of your excellency's intention to reinforce this po&s;t.</P>
<P>"On the following day the Vigilant galley took a &s;tation to cover the left flank of our army; and at ten o'clock that night the rebels made an attempt to &s;urpri&s;e a &s;ubaltern's picquet from the An&s;pach corps, but were repul&s;ed, after killing one man and wounding two others.</P>
<P>"The 29th at break of day, it was perceived that the enemy had retreated during the night, upon which Major-General Pre&s;cot was ordered to detach a regiment from the &s;econd line under his command, over Ea&s;ton's Beach, towards the left flank of the enemy's encampment, and a part of Brown's Corps was directed to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their works. At the &s;ame time Brigadier-General Smith was detached with the 22d and 43d regiments, and the flank com|panies of the 38th and 54th, by the Ea&s;t road, Ma|jor-General Lo&s;sberg marching by the We&s;t Road, with the He&s;&s;ian cha&s;&s;eurs and the An&s;pach regiments of Voit and Seaboth, in order, if po&s;&s;ible, to annoy them in their retreat; and upon receiving a report from General Smith, that the rebels made a &s;tand, and were in force upon Quaker's Hill, I ordered the 54th and He&s;&s;ian regiment of Huyn, with part of Brown's corps, to &s;u&s;tain him; but before they could arrive, the per&s;everance of General Smith, and the &s;pirited behaviour of the troops, had gained po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion of the &s;trong po&s;t on Quaker's Hill, and obliged the enemy to retire to their works at the North end of the i&s;land. On hearing a &s;mart fire from the
<PB N="559" REF="570">cha&s;&s;eurs engaged on the We&s;t road, I di&s;patched Col. Fanning's corps of provincials to join Gen. Lo&s;|berg, who obliged the rebels to quit two redoubts made to cover their retreat, drove them before him, and took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Turkey-Hill. Towards even|ing, an attempt being made by the rebels to &s;urround and cut off the cha&s;&s;eurs, who were advanced on the left, the regiments of Fanning and Huin were order|ed up to their &s;upport, and, after a &s;mart engagement with the enemy, obliged them to retreat to their main body on Windmill Hill.</P>
<P>After the&s;e actions the enemy took po&s;t in great numbers on Windmill-Hill, and employed them&s;elves in &s;trengthening that advantageous &s;ituation.</P>
<P>"This night the troops lay on their arms on the ground they had gained, and directions were given for bringing up the camp equipage. Artillery was likewi&s;e &s;ent for, and preparations made to remove the rebels from the redoubts; but by means of the great number of boats, they retreated in the night of the 30th over Bri&s;tol and Howland's Ferry; thus re|linqui&s;hing every hold on the i&s;land, and re&s;igning to us its entire po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion."</P>
<P>The expedition of General Grey again&s;t Martha's Vineyard, to wage war with &s;heep and oxen, &s;hews that our generals were at a great lo&s;s how to proceed, and that they could now carry on no enterprize which had the lea&s;t pro&s;pect of being deci&s;ive, or was worthy of the expence that was now be&s;towed in carrying it on. Notwith&s;tanding the bravery of Gen. Grey, and the conduct with which he managed his expedition, yet it is plain from his own account, that it was only a temporary excur&s;ion, which could not
<PB N="560" REF="571">be &s;upported much longer than the moment of the execution. The General's account of his expedition is dared on board the Carysfort. White&s;tone, Sept. 18, 1778, and is a follows:</P>
<P>"IN the evening of the 4th in&s;tant the fleet, with the detachment under my command, &s;ailed from New London, and &s;tood to the Ea&s;tward with a favourable wind. We were only retarded in the run from thence to Buzzard's Bay, by the altering our cour&s;e for &s;ome hours in the night, in con&s;equence of the di&s;|covery of a &s;trange fleet, which was not known to be Lord Howe's until morning. By five o'clock in the afternoon of the 5th, the &s;hips were at anchor in Clark's Cove, and the boats having been previou&s;ly hoi&s;ted out, the debarkation of the troops took place immediately. I proceeded without lo&s;s of time to de&s;troy the ve&s;&s;els and &s;tores, in the whole extent of Accu&s;hnet River, (about &s;ix miles) particularly at Bedford and Fair-Haven, and having di&s;mantled and burnt a fort on the Ea&s;t-&s;ide of the river, mounting 11 pieces of heavy cannon, with a magazine and bar|racks, completed the re-embarkation before noon the next day. I refer your Excellency to the next return for the enemy's lo&s;&s;es, as far as we are able to a&s;cer|tain them, and for our own ca&s;ualties.</P>
<P>"The wind did not admit of any further move|ment of the fleet the 6th and 7th, than hauling a little di&s;tance from the &s;hore. Advantage was taken of this circum&s;tance to burn a large privateer &s;hip on the Stocks, and to &s;end a &s;mall armament of boats, with two gallies, to de&s;troy two or three ve&s;&s;els, which being in the &s;tream, the troops had not been able to &s;et fire to.</P>
<PB N="561" REF="572">
<P>"From the difficulties in pa&s;&s;ing out of Buzzard's Bay into the Vineyard Sound, through Quick&s;et's Hole, and from Headwinds, the fleet did not reach Holmes's Hole harbour, in the i&s;land of Martha's Vineyard, until the 10th. The tran&s;ports, with the light infantry, grenadiers, and 33d regiment, were an|chored without the harbour, as I had at that time a &s;ervice in view for tho&s;e corps, whil&s;t the bu&s;ine&s;s for collecting cattle &s;hould be carried on upon the i&s;land. I was obliged by contrary winds to relinqui&s;h my de|&s;igns.</P>
<P>"On our arrival off the harbour, the inhabitants &s;ent per&s;ons on board to a&s;k my intentions with re&s;pect to them, to whom a requi&s;ition was made of the arms of the militia, the public money, 300 oxen, and 10,000 &s;heep. They promi&s;ed each of the&s;e articles &s;hould be delivered without delay. I afterwards &s;ound it nece&s;&s;ary to &s;end &s;mall detachments into the i&s;land, and detain the deputed inhabitants for a time, in order to accelerate their compliance with the de|mand.</P>
<P>"The 12th was able to embark on board the ve&s;&s;els, which arrived that day from Rhode-I&s;land, 6000 &s;heep, and 130 oxen.</P>
<P>"The 13th and 14th were employed in embarking cattle and &s;heep on board our own fleet; in de&s;troy|ing &s;ome &s;alt-works; in burning or taking in the in|lets what ve&s;&s;els and boats could be &s;ound, and in re|ceiving the arms of the militia. I here again refer your Excellency to returns.</P>
<P>"On the 15th the fleet left Martha's Vineyard; and after &s;u&s;taining the next day a &s;evere gale of wind, arrived the 17th at White&s;tone, without any material damage.</P>

<P>"I hold my&s;elf much obliged to the commanding officers of corps, and to the troops in general, for the alacrity with which every &s;ervice was performed."</P>
<P>The whole progre&s;s of our army in America began to be exceedingly &s;low, and the &s;everal exertions in the various excur&s;ions and expeditions, were carried on with a degree of timidity, which plainly indicated an apprehen&s;ion that they had to deal with an ene|my who&s;e importance was rather to be dreaded than de&s;pi&s;ed. In all motions for &s;upplies of forage, the principal care was fir&s;t to ob&s;erve the motions of the enemy, and to guard again&s;t an attack of the militia or provincial forces, who generally made &s;uch furious attacks upon the foraging parties, as made them pur|cha&s;e dearly the &s;mall &s;upplies they obtained. The lo&s;&s;es on the&s;e occa&s;ions were generally as much con|cealed as po&s;&s;ible, to keep up the &s;pirits of the troops, and to deceive the public at home; but in &s;pite of all &s;ecre&s;y, as much tran&s;pired, as fully declared that our power, influence, and hopes were very much upon the decline.</P>
<P>It has been one of the misfortunes of this war, that it began in inju&s;tice, and has been carried on with lies and di&s;&s;imulation. The expedition to Egg-harbour, the attack of the village of Taapan, are repre&s;ented as &s;ucce&s;sful expeditions, where only one or two are &s;aid to be killed; whereas, &s;ome who were engaged in the&s;e excur&s;ions, and have come home &s;ince, give a very different account of them.</P>
<P>Gen. Cornwallis's expedition referred to in Sir Henry Clinton's letter of October 8, is &s;et forth as a mo&s;t &s;ucce&s;sful one, though it was attended with both lo&s;s and danger. The only &s;ucce&s;sful part of it was that which was conduced by General Grey,
<PB N="563" REF="574">who, indeed, was the &s;oul of every action where he was pre&s;ent, yet that general is far from giving &s;uch windy accounts of the &s;ucce&s;s of our army, as our Gazettes have done after manufacturing the letters, which the mini&s;try received from the Briti&s;h com|manders. The mini&s;try have indeed been &s;ometimes deceived by ignorant &s;elf intere&s;ted per&s;ons, who, de&s;titute of all knowledge of what was tran&s;acted, have affirmed the gro&s;&s;e&s;t fal&s;ehoods, through the in|fluence of corrupt prejudices. Even &s;ome who never were ten miles from New York, and who were un|acquainted with the whole tran&s;actions on either &s;ide, have had the vain effrontery to affirm that the Ame|ricans never &s;ought, never could fight, and never would fight. The te&s;timony of General Grey, a character of the fir&s;t rank in every view, whether as a gentleman, a citizen, or officer, is contradicted, with regard to the very objects of his own &s;en&s;es, by per&s;ons that were never acquainted in the &s;malle&s;t degree, with any tran&s;actions of the American war.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A pe$$$ $$e &s;chool-ma&s;ter, who, like the good Mr Galloway, was obliged to leave Ameri$$$ for con|&s;cience-&s;ake, has lately publi&s;hed a pamphlet, wherein be po&s;itively affirms, That the Americans never fought, nor could fight; and that all tho&s;e that have been $illed on our &s;ide, have killed them&s;elves or one another: for it is certain that many thou&s;ands have been &s;lain, and if the Americans never fought, it is manife&s;t they could never kill our men. This Mr Robin&s;on confe&s;&s;es that he was never twelve miles out of New York, &s;o of con&s;equence, as he had nothing to do but receive in|telligence, he mu&s;t be undoubtedy the be&s;t authority to depend upon.
<P>He ought, however, out of good manner$ to his Engli&s;h render, before he had &s;at down to write a pam|phlet, fir&s;t con&s;idered whether he could write Engli&s;h, and not have expo&s;ed him&s;elf and wearied his reader with illiterate and ungram|matical fal&s;ehoods. If he intended to write a romance, he ought to have done it genteelly, and not di&s;|graced his order, by murdering his own language, of which he is &s;aid to be a teacher. If is &s;omewhat &s;ur|pri&s;ing that men, &s;hould pay &s;o little regard to truth and con&s;i&s;tency, as to affirm what thou&s;ands can, from the fulle&s;t certainty, contradict. With a de&s;ign of throwing the mi&s;car|riages of the mini&s;try, upon the of|ficers and generals who have com|manded in America, &s;ome who, a few years ago, affirmed publicly that the coloni&s;ts were the mo&s;t con&s;um|mate cowards in the world, have now exalted them above the great|e&s;t heroes of antiquity. They have made General Wa&s;hington, with 3000 men, oppo&s;e General Howe with 16,000, chace Sir Henry Clin|ton out of Philadelphia, pur&s;ue him through the Jer&s;eys, and make him take refuge in New-York; they have made 17 American &s;mall ve&s;|&s;els re&s;i&s;t 50 Engli&s;h men of war, which American &s;hips, three years ago, dur&s;t not peep out of the har|bour: And, what is &s;trange&s;t of all, the&s;e things happened all at the &s;ame time; for when General Howe was neglecting his duty he was victori|ous; when Sir Henry Clinton was retreating he was conquering; and when Lord Howe was betraying his king, he, at the &s;ame time, by the&s;e authors own account, was ta|king and de&s;troying all the American &s;hips.</P></NOTE></P>

<P>The expedition to Egg harbour was perhaps as well conducted as the nature of the thing would ad|mit of, and there was neither want of bravery in the men nor conduct in the officers, but the greate&s;t hu|man wi&s;dom and courage. No officers can do more than what is competent to them. A whole continent rouzed with jealou&s;y of their liberties, and fired with an enthu&s;ia&s;m for all that is dear to men, were likely to make efforts and exertions, that tho&s;e that are lukewarm in the cau&s;e of freedom, or &s;laves to de&s;po|ti&s;m, have no ideas of. It is no way &s;trange, that tho&s;e at home, who either do not love true liberty, or are under the influence of ba&s;er pa&s;&s;ions, &s;hould think it incredible for others to ri&s;que their lives for what they &s;et no value upon. It mu&s;t appear a thing incredible to them: and it is on this account that they have, through the influence of their incredulity, determined that our officers have not done their duty. They cannot per&s;uade them&s;elves that men, not &s;oldiers by profe&s;&s;ion, and &s;erving with|out hire, would venture their lives for what <HI>they</HI> reckon a phantom, or a mere creature of the imagina|tion. They therefore infer that the generals have not done their duty, but lengthened out the war for the &s;ake of emolument.</P>

<P>Our gains and advantages in America were far from being equal to our wa&s;te of trea&s;ure and lo&s;s of men: In every expedition the lo&s;s was double; for we both de&s;troyed our own colonies, and lo&s;t a great number of our army, without any hope of &s;ubduing the one or &s;peedily recruiting the other. To all this was added the lo&s;s of the i&s;land of Dominica, in the month of September this year, which was taken by the French on the 17th of that month, an account of which was given by Lieutenant Governor Stuart, in the following words.</P>
<P>"I AM exceedingly &s;orry, that &s;o &s;oon after clo&s;ing my di&s;patches, I have the mortification to acquaint your lord&s;hip that this i&s;land is in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the French King.</P>
<P>"In the morning of the 17th in&s;t. at half pa&s;t four, upon hearing a gun from our battery and &s;ignal po&s;t at Ca&s;hacron, or Scott's Head, and ob&s;erving the &s;ig|nal for an enemy, I ordered Young's battery of Ro|&s;eau, being near me, to repeat it, in conformity to in&s;tructions for taking up &s;ignals; about a quarter of an hour afterwards a &s;econd gun was fired, and the &s;ignal &s;till continued; and day-light &s;hortly after ap|pearing, I di&s;covered &s;ome ve&s;&s;els coming round the point, and &s;oon perceived, in&s;tead of ours, a white flag flying on the battery. The&s;e ob&s;ervations, and the increa&s;ing number of ve&s;&s;els which came in &s;ight, &s;oon convinced me that they were enemies, who had forced the battery, and were coming to attack the i&s;land. I in&s;tantly ordered the alarm to be given for a&s;&s;embling our forces: In the mean time the &s;hips and ve&s;&s;els &s;tood for a place named Point Michel, two miles &s;outh of Ro&s;eau, and, as they approached, I di&s;covered that they con&s;i&s;ted of four frigates, ten
<PB N="566" REF="577">armed &s;loops and &s;chooners, with about 20 others, being tran&s;ports with troops. About 6 o'clock boats were &s;een going on &s;hore at Point Michel, and men landing from them in great numbers. As they were beyond the read of our guns, they effected their lan$ing without oppo&s;ition.</P>
<P>"I had at this time made the be&s;t di&s;po&s;ition I could to impede their approach to the town. I had detached Lieutenant Ro&s;s, the only officer of artillery we had in garri&s;on, with &s;ix matro&s;&s;es, and Lieutenant Jones, of the 48th regiment, an officer of militia, and a volunteer of the 48th regiment, Mr Warner, with 24 men, half regulars of the 48th and half militia, to defend the battery at Loubiere, which was about half way between Ro&s;eau and the place where the enemy were landing. Capt. Grove, commanding the detachment of the 48th regiment, was po&s;ted in Young's battery in the town of Ro&s;eau, our mo&s;t im|portant po&s;t, with Lieut. Fenton, and 29 men of the 48th regiment, and 40 militia; 30 militia, with &s;ome matro&s;&s;es, were thrown into Melville's battery: A detachment of artillery, militia, with others, were placed with two field-pieces on Jolly's Hill, to oppo&s;e their march towards Charlotte-Town, and Capt. Man, the chief engineer, commanded the remainder of the militia, a few volunteer troopers and others, on the new battery at Guey's Hill.</P>
<P>"The landing of the enemy, amounting at lea&s;t to 2000 men, was in three divi&s;ions; the fir&s;t of which we could pretty nearly di&s;tingui&s;h on their way to be about 600, marching towards us, as &s;oon as they were landed, under a very bri&s;k fire from all our bat|teries on that &s;ide; and on their being within 200 yards of Loubiere battery, all the artillery ammuni|tion
<PB N="567" REF="578">being expended, which had been carried there, as it was unfini&s;hed and had no magazine, Lieutenants Ro&s;s and Jones, with their parties, retired, the fir&s;t joining the party at Melville's battery, and the other that on Jolly's Hill, according to directions I had given: the enemy in the mean time took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Loubiere battery; but our heavy fire from our others &s;oon obliged them to quit it, and to &s;helter them&s;elves under cover of the highlands on the Ro|&s;eau &s;ide of Loubiere river, where they took po&s;t, waiting for the other two divi&s;ions, which we could fee in full march from Point Michel to join them.</P>
<P>"We &s;oon di&s;covered they had &s;ent a con&s;iderable detachment, amounting, as we have been informed, to 300 men, being grenadiers and cha&s;&s;eurs, to the heights of Dumoulin's Hill; &s;ome of them were al|ready on the ridge, ready to attack us on the rear of Guey's Hill and Melville's battery.</P>
<P>"The main body, now reinforced by the arrival of the other divi&s;ions, had begun to form, in order to advance to the town. A large body of the enemy was then di&s;covered to be landing, under cover of a frigate, on the north &s;ide of the town, con&s;i&s;ting, ac|cording to the information we have &s;ince received, of about five hundred privateers men and people of co|lour. The&s;e &s;everal attacks, it &s;eems, were to have been made at the &s;ame time, for which, we have been informed, &s;ignals were to have been given from the heights.</P>
<P>"Three of the frigates at the &s;ame time ap|proached us in different directions, to cannonade Young's battery and the town.</P>
<P>"It was now about twelve o'clock, when I re|ceived a me&s;&s;age on Jolly's Hill, on the point of which
<PB N="568" REF="579">I was reconnoitring the di&s;po&s;ition of the forces of the enemy, from the council of the i&s;land and others of the principal inhabitants, reque&s;ting, that, on ac|count of the mo&s;t critical and dangerous &s;ituation of the colony, I would call a council of war. My zeal for his maje&s;ty's &s;ervice, my affection for his &s;ubjects, and my own honour, were inducements for me to comply with their reque&s;ts, and to a&s;&s;emble the mili|tary officers as &s;oon as it was po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>"The opinion of the council, on con&s;ideration of the force of the enemy and our own, I &s;end your lord&s;hip enclo&s;ed. I accordingly &s;ent a flag of truce to the enemy, to know what terms would be granted to us if we &s;hould be inclined to capitulate; re&s;olving at the &s;ame time to accept of none but &s;uch as would be honourable to his maje&s;ty, and beneficial to his &s;ubjects, or to re&s;i&s;t to the la&s;t extremity. A parley for an hour was con&s;ented to by the Marquis de Bou|ille, who commanded the French troops; and the ar|ticles of capitulation which I now &s;end to your lord|&s;hip were agreed to on his part and mine. During the time of the parley, one of the French &s;hips called the Tourterelle fired two broad&s;ides upon Young's Battery and the town, which had very nearly broken it off, and brought us into immediate action.</P>
<P>"The enemy in the attack mu&s;t have lo&s;t con&s;i|derably, but they at pre&s;ent conceal the number; the lo&s;s to his maje&s;ty was only two privates of the 48th regiment. The different attacks of the enemy were commanded by the Marquis de Bouille, gover|nor-general of Martinico, the Marquis Duchelleau, now governor of Dominica, Count de Tilly. Vi&s;count Damas, and Chevalier Jeffrey, a lieutenant-general and engineer.</P>

<P>The military tran&s;actions of this year ended neither with honour nor advantage to Great Britain: All things in every quarter of the Globe, except the Ea&s;t Indies, wore a frowning a&s;pect. In that quarter the Company's forces were &s;ucce&s;sful, and the French intere&s;t almo&s;t totally reduced. This an&s;wered one purpo&s;e for the mini&s;try, which, though it was of no real &s;ervice in the general cau&s;e, yet helped them to cover over their weakne&s;s and infirmity by a confi|dent boa&s;ting of the weakne&s;s of the French, and what they would do in another campaign to that per|fidious enemy, in other parts of the world. The nation would have probably &s;uffered the&s;e de|ceptions to have pa&s;&s;ed without much notice, had the people been hearty in the American war; but as they generally abhorred its principles, they were much averfe to rai&s;ing money for carrying it on, and generally interpreted the want of &s;ucce&s;s to the want of ju&s;tice in the cau&s;e in which the nation was en|gaged. They moreover con&s;idered this was as a conflict between the ambition of the government and the rights of the people, and were di&s;po&s;ed to con|&s;ider the ca&s;e of the Americans as what would be their own, provided they &s;hould refu&s;e &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to new &s;tatutes, which were incon&s;i&s;tent with the old laws of the con&s;titution. Neither the hearts nor
<PB N="570" REF="581">prayers of the people went along with this unnatural war, which made all mea&s;ures concerning it both heavy and offen&s;ive. The &s;elf-intere&s;ted, who were waiting for favour and preferment, were zealous enough in the cau&s;e, though they were not even willing to ri&s;que much in &s;upport of it, except when they found their immediate intere&s;t concerned.</P>
<P>It is a thing that appeared extraordinary to many, that the &s;upplies &s;hould have been granted with &s;o lit|tle oppo&s;ition, when no account had been given of the manner of their application, nor the &s;malle&s;t hopes that the nation would ever, by any future advantage, recover the lo&s;s which it had already &s;u&s;tained by the war. Many of the fir&s;t characters in the nation had been in the oppo&s;ition from the commencement of this conte&s;t, and from principle had oppo&s;ed all the mea&s;ures of the mini&s;try, becau&s;e they con&s;idered them unju&s;t and erroneous; while others were &s;ome|times on one &s;ide and &s;ometimes on the other, accor|ding as their hopes of intere&s;t or preferment prevailed. At the conclu&s;ion of this campaign the hopes of the mo&s;t &s;anguine in favour of the American war were become exceedingly feeble, while their de&s;ires and inclinations were as &s;trong as ever. One party, though they perceived the project of &s;ubduing the Americans impracticable, were, by their intere&s;ts and &s;ituation, unwilling to give it up; the&s;e &s;till flattered the nation, that another effort would certainly prove &s;ucce&s;sful; another party, though not &s;o immediately intere&s;ted, from an apprehen&s;ion that it was di&s;ho|nourable to yield in any particular to our own colo|nies, were for ruining both, rather than tarni&s;h the dignity of Britain by the &s;malle&s;t conde&s;cen&s;ion.
<PB N="571" REF="582">Without enquiring into the ju&s;tice or equity of the war, they con&s;idered that Britain, when once en|gaged, &s;hould never yield upon any con&s;ideration. The&s;e latter proved but weak politicians, and were &s;ufficiently di&s;po&s;ed to be dupes to others, who had much deeper de&s;igns.</P>
<P>While both the nation at home, and the colonies abroad, were groaning under the weight and burden of the war, and every year new taxes were added to the former oppre&s;&s;ions, the nation did not in the lea&s;t remit in its luxury, vices, and di&s;&s;ipation. All the u&s;ual extravagances were pur&s;ued, and diver&s;ions carried on, as if the nation had been in the mo&s;t flouri&s;hing condition, and wealth had been teeming in from all points of the compa&s;s. The expences of public &s;hews, and court entertainments, rather encrea&s;ed than dimi|ni&s;hed with the burdens of the nation, and even at the time that we were threatened with a foreign inva&s;ion, not one fa&s;hionable plea&s;ure was re&s;trained. Even the time appointed for religious humiliation and devotion, was made the occa&s;ion of idlene&s;s and di&s;&s;ipation, by tho&s;e who profe&s;&s;ed to be mo&s;t deeply intere&s;ted in the fate of the nation. The more &s;ober and thoughtful al&s;o turned li&s;tle&s;s, and began to be carele&s;s about the alarming events that &s;eemed to be approaching, that nothing could rou&s;e them to a &s;en&s;e of their danger, at the &s;ame time that they were murmuring and com|plaining of the badne&s;s of the times. Religion was turned into a mere form of godline&s;s, and true zeal was departed from all ranks; ardor, in the practice of religion, was deemed enthu&s;ia&s;m, and laughed out of countenance by tho&s;e who had formerly &s;hewn &s;ome examples thereof. The mo&s;t &s;olemn and &s;acred
<PB N="572" REF="583">things were made &s;ervants to men's appetites, inter|e&s;ts, and plea&s;ure, and the fear of &s;in and tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, except where immediate puni&s;hment was vi&s;ible, &s;eemed to have taken wing to &s;ome other climate. Animo&s;ity, ari&s;ing from the &s;pirit of party, came to &s;o great a height, that friends who formerly had &s;upport|ed the &s;ocial character, became aliens to one another; mutual affection, the true bond of &s;ociety, declined to an amazing degree, and rancor and malignity raged with unbounded violence. The friends of the mini|&s;try, and of the American war, were &s;hewing their re&s;entment, by declaring what they thought tho&s;e in oppo&s;ition de&s;erved, and &s;carcely would allow them a right to live in this world.</P>
<P>The Jacobites and Tories, who, a little more than thirty years ago, had been in actual rebellion again&s;t the King and the laws, were now broke loo&s;e in abu|&s;ing all who were again&s;t the American war, with the opprobrious names of rebels. The meane&s;t and mo&s;t unju&s;t per&s;onal abu&s;e was publi&s;hed in Jacobite News-papers, managed by Papi&s;ts and Tories, again&s;t men who had nothing to defend them except their own innocence. This produced a general irritation of parties, and &s;ometimes made the oppo&s;ition expo&s;e matters of fact, which otherwi&s;e would have pa&s;&s;ed in oblivion. But on &s;ome occa&s;ions the publi&s;hing of the mo&s;t notorious facts became dangerous, and were con&s;tructed by judges and court lawyers to be libels puni&s;hable by law, when the unhappy publi&s;hers were &s;everely fined or impri&s;oned for an example to others.</P>
<P>The Papi&s;ts, who had, ever &s;ince the pa&s;&s;ing of the Quebec Bill, con&s;idered the mini&s;try as their friends, employed their pens and intere&s;t in &s;upport|ing
<PB N="573" REF="584">this unnatural war, and their prie&s;ts began to &s;hew an in&s;olence unknown for many years pa&s;t. This produced &s;ome reflections upon their characters and religion, which had lain dormant for a great while. It was alledged that it did not become men, who had all &s;worn allegiance to the Chevalier de St. George, to give the epithets of rebel or traitor to men who were the true&s;t friends of his pre&s;ent maje&s;ty, and the revolution &s;ettlement. As all the popi&s;h clergy, who take orders abroad, in the Engli&s;h colleges, are, by the authority of the Pope, obliged to &s;wear allegiance to the Pretender when they enter upon holy orders, it gave them no &s;mall offence to hear this &s;ecret pub|li&s;hed over all Great Britain. Whether our mini|&s;try actually knew this &s;ecret or not, may probably be di&s;puted, but it is what the papi&s;ts cannot deny, and what &s;ome of the fir&s;t character openly confe&s;s. This was con&s;idered by the friends of the con&s;titu|tion as trea&s;on again&s;t our King and the laws, and and was animadverted upon with &s;ome warmth and zeal. The tempers of men being more and more agi|tated by this controver&s;y, produced many acrimoni|ous reflections on both &s;ides, &s;o that frequently that decency which is even due to an enemy, was tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ed. Tho&s;e reflections which proceeded from zeal and want of temper, were imputed to malevolence and ill-nature; and the friends of the mini&s;try, on their part, were careful to make it believed, that the argu|ments of the oppo&s;ition proceeded from di&s;loyalty and di&s;affection to government; for though they knew in their hearts, that the King had not more loyal &s;ubjects, yet becau&s;e they were in oppo&s;ition to their mea&s;ures, they wanted every one to believe they were traitors.
<PB N="574" REF="585">But what &s;eemed the mo&s;t unfea&s;ible conjecture in the heat of this di&s;putation, was, that the oppo&s;ition were the cau&s;e of protracting the war, when it was well known, that every &s;upply which the mini&s;try judged nece&s;&s;ary, was granted according to their de|&s;ire. The whole management was in their own hands, and they rai&s;ed as many men, and as large &s;ums of money as ever they had a mind. Had the nation been ever &s;o unanimous, they could not have done more than was done, and provided wi&s;dom and ju&s;tice had been the principles of action, the &s;upplies were abundantly &s;ufficient. But the want of judgment and ju&s;tice in planning and executing this unnatural war, was the &s;ole cau&s;e of all our mi&s;carriages, from the beginning hitherto. Tho&s;e who are engaged in a party, through intere&s;t, ambition, or &s;ome other ba&s;e pa&s;&s;ion, may throw the blame of want of &s;ucce&s;s in this war, on whom they plea&s;e; but &s;uppo&s;e it had been ever &s;o &s;ucce&s;sful, no wi&s;e or good man could, in his con&s;cience, have determined it to be ju&s;t. The crimes for which the coloni&s;ts have been &s;o violently pro&s;ecuted by war, have never been proved, by the mo&s;t zealous advocates for carrying it on, de&s;erving thereof, unle&s;s the laws of the con&s;titution are ambu|latory, and are always to be determined by the will and plea&s;ure of the ruling powers. Rea&s;on and com|mon &s;en&s;e will readily teach every impartial enquirer that the cau&s;es of this war, were ambition in govern|ment and a de&s;ire to extend dominion beyond the ancient &s;tatutes. Whatever may be the i&s;&s;ue and event of this unhappy conte&s;t, po&s;terity will conclude that the coloni&s;ts have made a noble &s;truggle for what nature and rea&s;on teach all men to revere and pur&s;ue,
<PB N="575" REF="586">as far as they have power and ability. The wealth and power of Britain may enable her to maintain the conflict, and probably in the end make her victorious, but impartial po&s;terity, removed far from both parties, will judge of the principles of the war, and not determine by its &s;ucce&s;s. Julius Cae&s;ar, though he was &s;ucce&s;sful in de&s;troying the Roman liberty, and e&s;tabli&s;hed the power of the emperor above the &s;enate and the laws, is far from being con&s;idered by po&s;te|rity as having done an honourable and a ju&s;t thing. It was his &s;ucce&s;s that laid the foundation of &s;lavery in Rome, and though the government had more of the &s;hining tin&s;el of external maje&s;ty, yet it lo&s;t its an|tient glory and &s;trength, which was for 800 years &s;upported by liberty, and the virtue of its citizens. The laws e&s;tabli&s;hed at the glorious revolution in Bri|tain, have for ninety years made the nation flouri&s;h in peace and abundance; the ju&s;tice and liberty im|plied in their character, and practi&s;ed by all ranks, has made her flouri&s;h, the envy and a&s;toni&s;hment of all Europe: But if &s;he depart from the&s;e glorious prin|ciples, and &s;uffer the&s;e &s;tatutes to be violated, which have &s;o long upheld her peace and &s;upported her glory, &s;he will &s;oon become the &s;corn of the nations, and a reproach over all the world. It will be unwi&s;e, from a pretence of more wi&s;dom and improvement, to remove land marks and fir&s;t principles, which have been known in experience to have been &s;o beneficial and &s;alutary to all ranks. Our &s;ound and whol&s;ome laws, made at the revolution, have exalted our &s;ove|reign to a pitch of true glory, and the nation to dig|nity it never knew before: Under their influence the empire has been extended, the &s;ubjects enriched
<PB N="576" REF="587">beyond the limits of former periods, and both the crown and the legi&s;lature arrived at a dignity unknown in former times. To lo&s;e all the&s;e advantages, and &s;acrifice them at the &s;hrine of dominion and de&s;poti&s;m, will &s;ink us below all degrees of compari&s;on, and make us in reality, le&s;s than the lea&s;t of the nations. The American war, if continued, will either be the aera of liberty to them, or the aera of &s;lavery to both them and us: this is what all good &s;ubjects will un|doubtedly deprecate, and &s;trive again&s;t, let intere&s;ted men &s;ay what they plea&s;e. This conte&s;t with Ame|rica will be a period in hi&s;tory, which po&s;terity will mark with an empha&s;is of admiration and a&s;toni&s;h|ment; and ages to come will declare that there lived a race of men beyond the Atlantic that made a noble &s;truggle to be free.</P>
