<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE favourable reception this tragedy has
met with from an indulgent publick, at a
period when the &s;hafts of undi&s;tingui&s;hing ridicule
have been (I think, injudiciou&s;ly) pointed at this
noble and affecting &s;pecies of the drama, calls for
my warme&s;t acknowledgments.</P>
<P>Nor mu&s;t my acknowledgments &s;top here. To
Mr. HARRIS my obligations are great: his good
&s;en&s;e and ta&s;te called my attention to more than
one impropriety in the conduct of the piece; when
fir&s;t offered; his liberal turn of mind gave it every
advantage of decoration; whil&s;t his candour and
politene&s;s removed the dragons which have been
&s;uppo&s;ed to guard the avenues to the theatre, and
which have too long deterred many of our greate&s;t
writers from taking this road to the Temple of
Fame.</P>
<P>A conduct like his cannot fail of having the
happie&s;t effects on the world of literature; of
pluming once more the eagle wing of genius, till
it &s;oars to that great &s;ublime which characterized
the writers of ancient Greece; and, in later times,
our immortal father of the drama.</P>
<P>To the performers in general I am obliged for
their attention and propriety in their different cha|racters.</P>
<P>Mr. HENDERSON, by his excellent and animated
performance, places in the &s;tronge&s;t point of light
the amiable virtues, unaffected grandeur of &s;oul,
and heroic ardour, which it was my aim to picture
in PHARNACES.</P>
<P>Mr. AICKIN fills with equal propriety and &s;pirit
the vindictive part of ATHRIDATES; and Mr.
CLARK, by the ju&s;tne&s;s of his action, and re&s;pec|tablene&s;s
of his deportment, gives an authority to
<PB N="iv" REF="3">
the character of ORONTES, which adds very greatly
to its effect.</P>
<P>I am now to &s;peak of Mrs. YATES. My friend|&s;hip
for her, a friend&s;hip founded not more on my
admiration of her uncommon talents, than on the
worthy qualities of her heart, with which a &s;eries
of years have made me perfectly acquainted, ren|der
it as hard a ta&s;k for me to &s;peak of her as of
my&s;elf. I feel a diffidence which impedes my
wi&s;h to do her ju&s;tice, even at the moment when
I am mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible how much my feeble attempts
to touch the nobler pa&s;&s;ions of the &s;oul owe to
her a&s;toni&s;hing exertion in the character of THA|MYRIS.</P>
<P>But the publick have &s;poken for me; have
given ju&s;t applau&s;e to that &s;ublime &s;en&s;ibility, that
enthu&s;ia&s;tic fire, tho&s;e exqui&s;ite graces of action,
which compel even FRANCE it&s;elf, however tena|cious
of native merit, to rank her with a DU|MESNIL,
a CLAIRON.</P>
<P>It remains only to return my thanks to tho&s;e
gentlemen who favoured me with the Prologue
and Epilogue: the good &s;en&s;e, poetic &s;pirit, and
flowing numbers, of the former, were finely ex|pre&s;&s;ed
by Mr. HENDERSON; whil&s;t the good-humoured
and lively raillery of the latter, which
&s;o happily (and I have authority to &s;ay, without
an idea of per&s;onality) catches the reigning follies
of the hour, gave full &s;cope to the comic powers
of Mrs. YATES.</P>
<P>I &s;hould here have fini&s;hed this addre&s;s, had not
the mi&s;take of a Critic, who has read the Engli&s;h
opera of PHARNACES, in&s;tead of the Italian one,
from whence I had the fir&s;t idea of my &s;able, led
him, though otherwi&s;e favourable in his &s;trictures,
to accu&s;e me of an illiberality, of which I &s;hould
dete&s;t my&s;elf if I was capable, that of &s;acri$icing
the other characters to my friend&s;hip for Mrs.
YATES. She wants no &s;uch unworthy &s;acri$ice;
<PB N="v" REF="4">
her native powers will ever &s;upport them&s;elves:
if &s;he appears more on the &s;cene, 'tis from the
nature of the fable, which rendered it impo&s;&s;ible
to make a different arrangement.</P>
<P>Comparatively &s;hort as the character of PHAR|NACES
nece&s;&s;arily is, I flatter my&s;elf it is not void of
intere&s;t; in&s;tead of humbling him at the feet of a
foreign general (for POMPEY is the real hero of the
Opera) I have endeavoured to re&s;tore him to the
dignity of royalty; have aimed at repre&s;enting him
a patriot, hero, king, the defender and father of his
people; not an abject dependent on the haughty
caprice, the tyrannic in&s;olence, of the ROMANS.</P>
<P>As to the child, the Italian author has judged as
I have done; and not hazarded introducing him
as a &s;peaker in the drama; therefore I cannot with
any ju&s;tice be accu&s;ed of withdrawing, in compli|ment
to my friend, a &s;ituation which never exi&s;ted
in the author from whom I borrowed the fir&s;t idea
of my &s;ubject.</P>
<P>What effect the contrary conduct in the Engli&s;h
Opera might have had, it is impo&s;&s;ible for me to
judge, as I was abroad at the time when it was
repre&s;ented; but I own I &s;hould have trembled at
hazarding, in the character of an infant, an effort
of heroi&s;m, which only reflection on the relative
duties of child and parent, at a much more ad|vanced
age, could have rendered probable.</P>
<P>I mean not by this to condemn the author of the
Engli&s;h Opera, but to exculpate my&s;elf. I have
too good an opinion of his judgment not to &s;uppo&s;e
the circum&s;tance might have effect; and an opera
is exempt from that &s;everity of critici&s;m to which
a tragedy mu&s;t ever be &s;ubject.</P>
<P>It is perhaps right to ob&s;erve, that &s;ome lines
which were judiciou&s;ly omitted in the repre&s;en|tation
are re&s;tored; but &s;o few that I thought it
unnece&s;&s;ary to mark them.</P>

<L>As if, attach'd to di&s;&s;ipation's wheel,</L>

<BYLINE>Written by a FRIEND,

<LG>
<L>IN all this bu&s;tle, rage, and tragic roar,</L>
<L>Which &s;ome wits here politely call a <HI>bore,</HI></L>
<L>Have I not wept, and rav'd, and tore my hair,</L>
<L>Till &s;ome I forc'd to weep, and &s;ome to &s;tare?</L>
<L>Yet now I mu&s;t, by cu&s;tom, to divert you,</L>
<L>Tell what I think of this heroic virtue.</L>
<L>Mirth has <HI>increas'd,</HI> when tragedies are fini&s;h'd,</L>
<L>Increa&s;es <HI>&s;till, and mu&s;t not be</HI> dimini&s;h'd.</L>
<L>Alive your pa&s;&s;ion tho' our play may keep,</L>
<L>Behind the curtain you mu&s;t have a peep.</L>
<L>Tho' bright the tragic character appear,</L>
<L>Our private foibles you delight to hear.</L>
<L>In life's great drama the &s;ame rule we find:</L>
<L>When on that &s;tage the patron of mankind</L>
<L>Performs his part&mdash;the public virtues &s;trike,</L>
<L>But 'tis the &s;ecret anecdote we like.</L>
<L>If there a Patriot rave with furious might,</L>
<L>And love his country&mdash;out of downright &s;pite;</L>
<L>It pa&s;&s;es for a copy of his face;</L>
<L>Has he not been to Court to beg a Place?</L>
<L>When &s;ome bright Orator his country's cau&s;e</L>
<L>Su&s;tains, and talks of Liberty and Laws,</L>
<L><HI>Hear, hear,</HI> all cry; in attitude he &s;tands,</L>
