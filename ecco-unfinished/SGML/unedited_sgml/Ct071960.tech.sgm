<HEAD>THE
PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>_THE Title of this Work is
an Index of the Perform|ance.
It is a collection of
u&s;eful in&s;tructions for a
young Trade&s;man. The
world is grown &s;o wi&s;e of late, or (if
you will) fancy them&s;elves &s;o, are &s;o
<PB N="iv" REF="4">
<HI>opiniatre,</HI> as the <HI>French</HI> well expre&s;s it,
&s;o &s;elf-wi&s;e, that I expect &s;ome will
tell us beforehand they know every
thing already, and want none of my
in&s;tructions; and to &s;uch indeed the&s;e in|&s;tructions
are not written.</P>
<P>HAD I not &s;een in a few years ex|perience
many young Trade&s;men mi&s;|carry
for want of tho&s;e very cautions
which are here given, I &s;hould have
thought this Work needle&s;s, and I am
&s;ure had never gone about to write it;
but as the contrary is manife&s;t, I thought,
and think &s;till, the world greatly want|ed
it.</P>
<P>AND be it that tho&s;e unfortunate
creatures that have thus blown them&s;elves
up in trade have mi&s;carried for want of
knowing, or for want of practi&s;ing what
is here offered for their Direction, whe|ther
for want of wit, or by too much
wit, the thing is the &s;ame, and the di|rection
is equally needful to both.</P>
<P><PB N="v" REF="5">
AN old experienc'd pilot &s;ometimes
lo&s;es a &s;hip by his a&s;&s;urance and over|confidence
of his knowledge, as effec|tually
as a young pilot does by his ig|norance
and want of experience; this
very thing, as I have been inform'd,
was the occa&s;ion of the fatal di&s;a&s;ter in
which Sir <HI>Cloude&s;ly Shovel,</HI> and &s;o many
hundred brave fellows, lo&s;t their lives in
a moment upon the Rocks of <HI>Scilly.</HI></P>
<P>HE that is above informing him&s;elf
when he is in danger, is above pity
when he mi&s;carries: a young Trade&s;|man
who &s;ets up thus full of him&s;elf,
and &s;corning advice from tho&s;e who
have gone before him, like a hor&s;e
that ru&s;hes into the battle, is only fear|le&s;s
of danger becau&s;e he does not un|der&s;tand
it.</P>
<P>IF there is not &s;omething extraordi|nary
in the temper and genius of the
Trade&s;men of this age, if there is not
&s;omething very &s;ingular in their, cu&s;|toms
<PB N="vi" REF="6">
and methods, their conduct and
behaviour in bu&s;ine&s;s; al&s;o if there is
not &s;omething different and more dan|gerous
and fatal in the common road
of trading, and Trade&s;mens management
now, than ever was before, what is the
rea&s;on that there are &s;o many Bankrupts
and broken Trade&s;men now among us,
more than ever were known before?</P>
<P>I make no doubt but there is as
much trade now, and as much gotten
by trading, as there ever was in this
nation, at lea&s;t in our memory; and
if we will allow other people to judge,
they will tell us there is much more
trade, and trade is much more gainful;
what then mu&s;t be the rea&s;on that the
Trade&s;men cannot live on their trades,
cannot keep open their &s;hops, cannot
maintain them&s;elves and families as well
now as they could before? Something
extraordinary mu&s;t be the ca&s;e.</P>
<P>THERE mu&s;t be &s;ome failure in the
<HI>Trade&s;man,</HI> it can be no where el&s;e;
<PB N="vii" REF="7">
<HI>either</HI> he is le&s;s &s;ober and le&s;s frugal,
le&s;s cautious of what he does, who he
tru&s;ts, how he lives, and how he be|haves,
than Trade&s;men u&s;e to be, <HI>or</HI> he
is le&s;s indu&s;trious, le&s;s diligent, and
takes le&s;s care and pains in his bu&s;ine&s;s,
or &s;omething is the matter; it cannot
be but if he had the &s;ame gain, and
but the &s;ame expence which the former
ages &s;uffered trade&s;men to thrive with,
he would certainly thrive as they did:
There mu&s;t be &s;omething out of or|der
in the foundation, he mu&s;t fail in
the e&s;&s;ential part, or he would not fail
in his trade: The &s;ame cau&s;es would
have the &s;ame effects in all ages; the
&s;ame gain, and but the &s;ame expence,
would ju&s;t leave him in the &s;ame place
as it would have left his predece&s;&s;or in
the &s;ame &s;hop; and yet we &s;ee one grow
rich, and the other &s;tarve under the very
&s;ame circum&s;tances.</P>
<P>THE temper of the times explains
the ca&s;e to every body that plea&s;es but
to look into it. The expences of a
<PB N="viii" REF="8">
family are quite different now from
what they have been; Trade&s;men can|not
live as Trade&s;men in the &s;ame cla&s;s
u&s;ed to live; cu&s;tom, and the manner
of all the Trade&s;men round them com|mand
a difference, and he that will
not do as others do, is e&s;teemed as no
body among them, and the Trade&s;man
is doom'd to ruin by the fate of the
times.</P>
<P>IN &s;hort, there is a fate upon a Trade&s;|man,
either he mu&s;t yield to the &s;nare
of the times, or be the je&s;t of the
times; the young Trade&s;man cannot re|&s;i&s;t
it; he mu&s;t live as others do, or
lo&s;e the credit of living, and be run
down as if he was broke: In a word,
he mu&s;t &s;pend more than he can afford
to &s;pend, and &s;o be undone, or not
&s;pend it, and &s;o be undone.</P>
<P>IF he lives as others do he breaks,
becau&s;e he &s;pends more than he gets; if
he does not, he breaks too, becau&s;e he lo&s;es
his credit, and that is to lo&s;e his trade;
what mu&s;t he do?</P>
<P><PB N="ix" REF="9">
THE following directions are cal|culated
for this exigency, and to pre|pare
the young Trade&s;man to &s;tem the
attacks of tho&s;e fatal cu&s;toms, which
otherwi&s;e, if he yields to them, will
inevitably &s;end him the way of all the
thoughtle&s;s Trade&s;men, that have gone
before him.</P>
<P>HERE he will be <HI>effectually, we hope,</HI>
encourag'd to &s;et out well, to begin
wi&s;ely and prudently, and to avoid all
tho&s;e rocks which the gay race of
trade&s;men &s;o frequently &s;uffer &s;hip|wrack
upon; and here he will have
a true plan of his own pro&s;perity
drawn out for him, by which, if it
be not his own fault, he may &s;quare
his conduct in an unerring manner,
and fear neither bad fortune nor bad
friends.</P>
<P>I had purpo&s;ed to give a great many
other cautions and directions in this work,
but it would have &s;pun it out too
<PB N="x" REF="10">
far, and have made it tedious: I would
indeed have di&s;cour&s;ed of &s;ome branches
of <HI>home trade,</HI> which nece&s;&s;arily em|barks
the Inland Trade&s;man in &s;ome
parts of foreign bu&s;ine&s;s, and &s;o makes
a merchant of the &s;hop-keeper almo&s;t
whether he will or no, <HI>for example:</HI></P>
<P>ALMOST all the &s;hop-keepers and
Inland Traders in &s;ea-port towns, or
even in the water-&s;ide-part of <HI>London</HI>
it &s;elf, are nece&s;&s;arily brought in to be
owners of &s;hips, and concerned at
lea&s;t in the ve&s;&s;el, if not in the voy|age;
&s;ome of their trades, perhaps,
relate to, or are employed in the
building, or fitting, or furni&s;hing out
&s;hips, as is the ca&s;e at <HI>Shoreham,</HI>
at <HI>Ip&s;wich, Yarmouth, Hull, Whitby,
Newca&s;tle,</HI> and the like: Others are
concern'd in the cargoes, as in the <HI>Her|ring
Fi&s;hery</HI> at <HI>Yarmouth</HI> and the adja|cent
Ports, the <HI>Colliery</HI> at <HI>Newca&s;tle,
Sunderland, &amp;c.</HI> and the like in ma|ny
other ca&s;es.</P>
<P><PB N="xi" REF="11">
IN this ca&s;e the &s;hop-keeper is &s;ome|times
a merchant adventurer, whether
he will or not, and &s;ome of his bu&s;i|ne&s;s
runs into &s;ea-adventures, as in the
<HI>Salt</HI> trade at <HI>Sheffield,</HI> in <HI>Northum|berland,</HI>
and <HI>Durham,</HI> and again at
<HI>Limington;</HI> and again in the Coal trade,
from <HI>Whitehaven</HI> in <HI>Cumberland</HI> to
<HI>Ireland,</HI> and the like.</P>
<P>THESE con&s;iderations urg'd me to
direct due cautions to &s;uch Trade&s;men,
and &s;uch as would be particular to
them, e&s;pecially not to launch put in
adventures beyond the compa&s;s of their
&s;tocks; and withal to manage tho&s;e
things with due warine&s;s: But this
work had not room for tho&s;e things;
and as that fort of amphibious Trade&s;|men,
<HI>for &s;uch they are,</HI> trading both
by water and by land, are not of the
kind with tho&s;e particularly aimed at in
the&s;e &s;heets, I thought it was better to
leave them quite out, than to touch
but lightly upon them.</P>
<P><PB N="xii" REF="12">
I had al&s;o de&s;igned one Chapter or
Letter to my <HI>Inland Trade&s;men,</HI> upon
the mo&s;t important &s;ubject: of <HI>borrow|ing
money upon intere&s;t,</HI> which is one
of the mo&s;t dangerous things a Trade&s;|man
is expo&s;ed to: It is a plea&s;ant
thing to a Trade&s;man to &s;ee his credit
ri&s;e, and men offer him money to
trade with, upon &s;o &s;lender a con&s;ide|ration
as 5 <HI>per cent.</HI> intere&s;t, when he
gets 10 <HI>per cent.</HI> perhaps twice in the
year; but it is a &s;nare of the mo&s;t
dangerous kind in the event, and has
been the ruin of &s;o many Trade&s;men,
that tho' I had not room for it in the
Work, I cou'd not let it pa&s;s without
this notice, <HI>in the Preface.</HI></P>
<Q><LIST>
<ITEM>1. INTEREST money eats deep in|to
the Trade&s;man's profits, becau&s;e
it is a payment certain, whether
the Trade&s;man gets or lo&s;es; and
as he may often get double, &s;o
&s;ometimes he lo&s;es, and then his
intere&s;t is a double payment; 'tis
<PB N="xiii" REF="13">
a Partner with him, under this un|happy
circum&s;tance, <HI>viz.</HI> that it
goes halves when he <HI>gains,</HI> but not
when he <HI>lo&s;es.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>2. THE Lender calls for his money
when he plea&s;es, and often comes
for it when the Borrower can ill
&s;pare it; and then, having launch'd
out in Trade on the &s;uppo&s;ition
of <HI>&s;o much in &s;tock,</HI> he is left to
&s;truggle with the enlarged trade
with a contracted &s;tock; and thus
he &s;inks under the weight of it,
cannot repay the money, is di&s;|honoured,
pro&s;ecuted, and at la&s;t
undone by the very loan which he
took in to help him.</ITEM>
</LIST></Q>
<P>INTEREST of money is a dead
weight upon the Trade&s;man, and as the
intere&s;t always keeps him low, the prin|cipal
&s;inks him quite down, when that
comes to be paid out again. Payment
of intere&s;t, to a Trade&s;man, is like
<HI>Cicero</HI> bleeding to death in a warm
<PB N="xiv" REF="14">
Bath, the plea&s;ing warmth of the Bath
makes him die in a kind of dream,
and not feel him&s;elf decay, till at la&s;t
he is exhau&s;ted, falls into convul&s;ions,
and expires.</P>
<P>A Trade&s;man held up by <HI>money at
intere&s;t,</HI> is &s;ure to &s;ink at la&s;t by the
weight of it, like a man thrown into
the &s;ea with a &s;tone tied about his
neck, who tho' he could &s;wim if he was
loo&s;e, he drowns in &s;pite of all his
&s;truggle.</P>
<P>INDEED this article would require
not a letter, but a book by it &s;elf, and
the tragical &s;tories of Trade&s;men un|done
by u&s;ury are &s;o many, and the
variety &s;o great, that they would make
a hi&s;tory by them&s;elves: But it mu&s;t
&s;uffice to treat it here only in general,
and give the Trade&s;men a warning of
it, as the <HI>Trinity-hou&s;e</HI> pilots warn &s;ail|ors
of a &s;and, by hanging a buoy up|on
it; or as the <HI>Edy</HI> &s;tone light-hou&s;e
upon a &s;unk rock, which, as the Poet &s;ays,
<PB N="xv" REF="15">
<HI>Bids men &s;tand off, and live; come near, and die.</HI></P>
<P>FOR a Trade&s;man to borrow money
upon intere&s;t, I take to be like a man
going into a hou&s;e infected with the
plague; 'tis not only likely that he may
be infected and die, but next to a mi|racle
if he e&s;capes.</P>
<P>THIS part being thus hinted at, I
think I may &s;ay of the following &s;heets,
That they contain all the directions
needful to make the Trade&s;man thrive;
and if he plea&s;es to li&s;ten to it with a
temper of mind willing to be directed,
he mu&s;t have &s;ome uncommon ill luck
if he mi&s;carries.</P>

<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>_BEING to direct this di&s;cour&s;e to
the <HI>trade&s;men</HI> of this nation, 'tis
needful, in order to make the &s;ub|&s;tance
of this work and the &s;ub|ject
of it agree together, that I
&s;hould in a few words explain the terms, and
tell the reader who it is we under&s;tand by the
word <HI>trade&s;man,</HI> and how he is to be qualified
in order to merit the title of <HI>complete.</HI></P>
<P>THIS is nece&s;&s;ary becau&s;e the &s;aid term <HI>trade&s;|man</HI>
is under&s;tood by &s;everal people, and in &s;e|veral
<PB N="2" REF="19">
places, in a different manner: <HI>for example,</HI>
In the North of <HI>Britain,</HI> and likewi&s;e in <HI>Ire|land,</HI>
when you &s;ay a <HI>trade&s;man,</HI> you are un|der&s;tood
to mean a mechanick, &s;uch as a <HI>&s;mith,</HI>
a <HI>carpenter,</HI> a <HI>&s;hoemaker,</HI> and the like, &s;uch as
here we call a <HI>handicraft&s;man.</HI> In like man|ner,
abroad they call a <HI>trade&s;man</HI> &s;uch only as
carry goods about from town to town, and
from market to market, or from hou&s;e to
hou&s;e to &s;ell; the&s;e in <HI>England</HI> we call <HI>petty
chapmen,</HI> in the North <HI>pethers,</HI> and in our or|dinary
&s;peech <HI>pedlars.</HI></P>
<P>BUT in <HI>England,</HI> and e&s;pecially in <HI>London,</HI>
and the South part of <HI>Britain,</HI> we take it in
another &s;en&s;e, and in general, all &s;orts of ware|hou&s;ekeepers,
&s;hopkeepers, whether whole&s;ale
dealers, or retailers of goods, are called <HI>trade&s;|men;</HI>
or to explain it by another word <HI>trading
men:</HI> &s;uch are, whether whole&s;ale or retale,
our <HI>grocers, mercers, linen</HI> and <HI>woollen drapers,</HI>
Blackwell-hall <HI>factors, tobacconi&s;ts, haberda&s;h|ers,</HI>
whether of hats or &s;mall wares, <HI>glovers,
ho&s;iers, milleners, book&s;ellers, &s;tationers,</HI> and
all other &s;hopkeepers, who do not actually
work upon, make, or manufacture the goods
they fell.</P>
<P>ON the other hand, tho&s;e who make the
goods they &s;ell, tho' they do keep &s;hops to
$ell them, are not called <HI>trade&s;men,</HI> but <HI>handi|crafts,</HI>
&s;uch as <HI>&s;miths, &s;hoemakers, founders,
joiners, carpenters, carvers, turners,</HI> and the
like; others, who only make, or cau&s;e to be
made, goods for other people to &s;ell, are cal|led
<HI>manufacturers</HI> and <HI>arti&s;ts, &amp;c.</HI> Thus di|&s;tingui&s;hed,
<PB N="3" REF="20">
I &s;hall &s;peak of them all as occa&s;ion
requires, raking this general explication to be
&s;ufficient; and I thus mention it to prevent be|ing
obliged to frequent and further particular
de&s;criptions as I go on.</P>

of traders above them, which we call <HI>mer|chants;</HI>
where 'tis needful to ob&s;erve, that in

greater than <HI>England,</HI> and more popu|lous
al&s;o, as <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Germany</HI> in particular.</P>
<P>I in&s;i&s;t that the trade of <HI>England</HI> is greater
and more con&s;iderable than that of any other
nation, for the&s;e rea&s;ons: (1.) Becau&s;e <HI>Eng|land</HI>
produces more goods as well for home
con&s;umption as for foreign exportation, (and
tho&s;e goods all made of its own produce or
manufactured by its own inhabitants) than any
other nation in the world. (2.) Becau&s;e <HI>Eng|land</HI>
con&s;umes within it &s;elf more goods of
foreign growth, imported from the &s;everal coun|tries
where they are produc'd or wrought, than
any other nation in the world. And, (3.) Be|cau&s;e
for the doing this <HI>England</HI> employs more
&s;hipping and more &s;eamen, than any other
nation (and &s;ome think than all the other na|tions)
of <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>HENCE, be&s;ides the great number of weal|thy
<HI>merchants</HI> who carry on this great foreign
negoce, and who by their corre&s;ponding with
all parts of the world, import the growth of
all countries hither; <HI>I &s;ay,</HI> be&s;ides the&s;e, we
have a very great number of con&s;iderable
dealers, whom we call <HI>trade&s;men,</HI> who are pro|perly
call'd warehou&s;ekeepers, who &s;upply the
merchants with all the &s;everal kinds of manu|factures,
and other goods of the produce of
<HI>England,</HI> for exportation; and al&s;o others who
are called <HI>whole&s;alemen,</HI> who buy and take off
from the <HI>merchants</HI> all the foreign goods
which they import; the&s;e, by their corre&s;pond|ing
<PB N="5" REF="22">
with a like &s;ort of <HI>trade&s;men</HI> in the country,

own al&s;o, among tho&s;e country <HI>trade&s;men,</HI> in|to
every corner of the kingdom, however re|mote;
and by them to the retailers; and by
the retailer to the la&s;t con&s;umer, which is the
la&s;t article of all trade. The&s;e are the <HI>trade&s;|men</HI>
under&s;tood in this work, and for who&s;e
&s;ervice the&s;e &s;heets are made publick.</P>
<P>HAVING thus de&s;crib'd the per&s;on, who I
under&s;tand by the <HI>Engli&s;h trade&s;man,</HI> 'tis then
needful to enquire into his qualifications, and
what it is that renders him a fini&s;h'd or <HI>complete</HI>
man in his bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. THAT he has a general knowledge of not
his own particular trade and bu&s;ine&s;s only;
that part indeed well denominates a handi|craft&s;man
to be a <HI>complete arti&s;t;</HI> but our <HI>com|plete
trade&s;man</HI> ought to under&s;tand all the in|land
trade of <HI>England,</HI> &s;o as to be able to
turn his hand to any thing, or deal in any
thing, or every thing, of the growth and pro|duct
of his own country, or the manufacture
of the people, as his circum&s;tances in trade or
other occa&s;ions may require; and may, if he &s;ees
occa&s;ion, lay down one trade, and take up ano|ther,
when he plea&s;es, without &s;erving a new
apprentice&s;hip to learn it.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. THAT he not only has a knowledge of
the &s;pecies or kinds of goods, but of the places
and peculiar countries where tho&s;e goods,
whether product or manufacture, are to be
found; that is to &s;ay, where produc'd, or where
made, and how to come at them, or deal in
<PB N="6" REF="23">
them, at the fir&s;t hand, and to his be&s;t advan|tage.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. THAT he under&s;tands perfectly well all the
methods of corre&s;pondence, returning money
or goods for goods, to and from every coun|ty
in <HI>England;</HI> in what manner to be done,
and in what manner mo&s;t to advantage; what
goods are generally bought by barter and ex|change,
and what by payment of money; what
for pre&s;ent money, and what for time; what
are &s;old by commi&s;&s;ion from the makers, what
bought by factors, and by giving commi&s;&s;ion
to buyers in the country, and what bought by
orders to the maker, and the like; what mar|kets
are the mo&s;t proper to buy every thing
at, and where and when; and what fairs are
proper to go to, in order to buy or &s;ell, or
meet the country dealer at; &s;uch as <HI>Sturbridge,
Bri&s;tol, Che&s;ter, Exeter;</HI> or what marts, &s;uch
as <HI>Beverly, Lyn, Bo&s;ton, Gainsborough,</HI> and
the like.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>IN order to complete the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> trade&s;|man
in this manner, the fir&s;t thing to be done
is to lay down &s;uch general maxims of trade
as are fit for his instruction, and then to de|&s;cribe
the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> or <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> product, being
the fund of its inland trade, whether we mean
its <HI>produce</HI> as the growth of the country, or
its <HI>manufactures,</HI> as the labour of her people;
then to acquaint the trade&s;man with the
manner of the circulation where tho&s;e things
are found, how and by what methods all tho&s;e
goods are brought to <HI>London,</HI> and from <HI>Lon|don</HI>
again convey'd into the country; where
<PB N="7" REF="24">
they are principally bought at be&s;t hand, and
mo&s;t to the advantage of the buyer, and where
the proper markets are to di&s;po&s;e of them again
when bought.</P>
<P>THESE are the degrees by which the <HI>complete
trade&s;man</HI> is brought up, and by which he is
in&s;tructed in the principles and methods of his
commerce, by which he is made, acquainted
with bu&s;ine&s;s, and is capable of carrying it
on with &s;ucce&s;s, after which there is not a
man in the univer&s;e de&s;erves the title of a
<HI>complete trade&s;man,</HI> like, the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> &s;hop|keeper.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER I.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the TRADESMAN in his Preparations
while an Apprentice.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_AS you reque&s;t me to write my
thoughts to you (as lei&s;ure permits)
by way of in&s;truction to young
<HI>trade&s;men,</HI> I have, in the be&s;t man|ner
I could, obey'd your orders in
the following &s;heers, which I hope will an&s;wer
your end, and be u&s;eful to tho&s;e young begin|ners
in trade, who are yet to launch out into
that &s;ea, where &s;o many, for want of good pi|lots,
have mi&s;carried.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t part of a trader's beginning is ordi|narily
very young, I mean, when he goes ap|prentice,
and the notions of trade are &s;carce
got into his head; for boys go apprentices while
they are but boys; to talk to them in their fir&s;t
three or four years &s;ignifies nothing; they are
rather then to be taught &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to families,
<PB N="9" REF="26">
and &s;ubjection to their ma&s;ters, and dutiful at|tendance
in their &s;hops or warehou&s;es; and this
is not our pre&s;ent bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>BUT after they have entred the fifth or &s;ixth
year, they may then be entertain'd with di&s;|cour&s;es
of another nature; and as they begin
then to look forward beyond the time of their
&s;ervitude, and think of &s;etting up and being for
them&s;elves, I think then is the time to put them
upon u&s;eful preparations for the work, and to
in&s;truct them in &s;uch things as may qualify them
be&s;t to enter upon the world, and act for them|&s;elves
when they are &s;o enter'd.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t thing a youth in the latter part of
his time is to do, is to endeavour to gain a good
judgment in the wares of all kinds that he
is like to deal in: The fir&s;t years of his time he
of cour&s;e learns, to weigh and mea&s;ure either
liquids or &s;olids, to pack up and make bales,
tru&s;&s;es, packs, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and to do the cour&s;er and
laborious part of bu&s;ine&s;s; but all that, gives
him little knowledge in the &s;pecies of the goods,
much le&s;s a nice judgment in their value and
&s;orts, which however is one of the principal
things that belongs to trade.</P>
<P>IT is &s;uppos'd that by this time, if his ma&s;ter
is a man of con&s;iderable bu&s;ine&s;s, his man is
become the elde&s;t apprentice, and is taken from
the counter, and from &s;weeping the warehou&s;e
into the compting-hou&s;e, where he among other
things &s;ees the bills of parcels of goods bought,
and thereby knows what every thing co&s;ts at fir&s;t
hand, what gain, is made of them, and if a mi&s;|carriage
happens, he knows what lo&s;s too; by
<PB N="10" REF="27">
which he is led of cour&s;e to look into the good|ne&s;s
of the goods, and &s;ee the rea&s;on of things:
If the goods are not to expectation, and con&s;e|quently
do not an&s;wer the price, he &s;ees the
rea&s;on of that lo&s;s, and he looks into the goods,
and &s;ees where and how far they are deficient,
and in what; this, if he be careful to make his
ob&s;ervations, brings him naturally to have a good
judgment in the goods.</P>
<P>IF a young man neglects this part, and pa&s;&s;es
over the &s;ea&s;on for &s;uch improvement, he very
rarely ever recovers it; for this part has its &s;ea|&s;on,
and that more remarkable than in many o|ther
ca&s;es, and that &s;ea&s;on lo&s;t never comes
again; a judgment in goods taken in early, is
never lo&s;t, and a judgment taken in late is &s;el|dom
good.</P>
<P>IF the youth &s;lips this occa&s;ion, and not mind|ing
what is before him goes out of his time, with|out
obtaining &s;uch a skill as this in the goods
he is to deal in, he enters into trade without
his mo&s;t u&s;eful tools, and mu&s;t u&s;e &s;pectacles be|fore
his time.</P>
<P>FOR want of this knowledge of the goods he
is at a lo&s;s in the buying part, and is liable to
be cheated and impos'd upon in the mo&s;t noto|rious
manner by the &s;harp-&s;ighted world; for
his want of judgment is a thing that cannot be
hid; the merchants or manufacturers who he
buys of pre&s;ently di&s;cover him; the very boys
in the whole&s;ale mens warehou&s;es and in mer|chants
warehou&s;es will play upon him, &s;ell him
one thing for another, &s;hew him a wor&s;e &s;ort
when he calls for a better, and asking a higher
<PB N="11" REF="28">
price for it, per&s;uade him it is better, and when
they have thus bubbled him, they triumph over
his ignorance when he is gone, and expo&s;e him
to the la&s;t degree.</P>
<P>BESIDES, for want of judgment in the goods
he is to buy, he often runs a hazard of being
cheated to a very great degree, and perhaps &s;ome
time or other a trade&s;man, may be ruin'd by it,
or at lea&s;t ruin his reputation.</P>
<P>WHEN I liv'd abroad, I had once a commi&s;&s;ion
&s;ent me from a merchant in <HI>London</HI> to buy a
large parcel of brandy: The goods were &s;ome|thing
out of my way, having never bought any
in that country before. However, it happen'd
that I had frequently bought and imported bran|dies
in <HI>England,</HI> and had &s;ome judgment in
them, &s;o much that I ventur'd to buy without
taking a cooper with me, which was not u&s;ual
in that place. The fir&s;t parcel of brandy I &s;aw
was very good, and I bought freely to the value of
about 600 <HI>l.</HI> and &s;hip'd them for <HI>England,</HI> where
they gave very good &s;atisfaction to my employer.
But I could not compleat my commi&s;&s;ion to my
mind in that parcel: Some days after &s;ome mer|chants,
who had &s;een me buy the other, and
thought me a novice in the bu&s;ine&s;s, and that
I took no cooper to ta&s;te the brandy, laid a
plot for me, which indeed was &s;uch a plot as I
was not in the lea&s;t aware of, and had not the
little judgment which I had in the commodity
prevented, I had been notoriou&s;ly abus'd. The
ca&s;e was thus: They gave me notice by the &s;ame
per&s;on who help'd me to the &s;ight of the fir&s;t
brandy, that there was a cellar of extraordinary
<PB N="12" REF="29">
good brandy at &s;uch a place, and invited me to
&s;ee it. Accordingly I went in an afternoon,
and ta&s;ted the brandy, being a large parcel, a|mounting
to about 460 <HI>l.</HI> &s;terling.</P>
<P>I liked the goods very well, but the merchant
as they call'd him, that is to &s;ay, the knave ap|pointed
to cheat the poor &s;tranger, was cun|ningly
out of the way; &s;o that no bargain was
to be made that night. But as I had &s;aid that I
lik'd the brandy, the &s;ame per&s;on who brought
me an account of them comes to my lodgings,
to treat with me about the price. We did not
make many words: I bad him the current price
which I had bought for &s;ome days before, and
after a few &s;truggles for five crowns a ton more,
he came to my price, and his next word was to
let me know the gage of the cask, and as I had
&s;een the goods already, he thought there was no|thing
to do but to make a bargain, and order the
goods to be deliver'd.</P>
<P>BUT as young as I was I was too old for that
too, but told him, I could not tell po&s;itively
how many I &s;hould take, but that I would come
in the afternoon, and ta&s;te them over again, and
mark out what I wanted. He &s;eem'd unea$ie at
that, and pretended he had two merchants wait|ed
to &s;ee them, and he could &s;ell them imme|diately,
and I might do him a prejudice, if I
made him wait, and put them off who perhaps
might buy in the mean time.</P>
<P>I an&s;wer'd him coldly, I would not hinder
him &s;elling them by any means if he could have
a better chapman, that I could not come &s;oon|er,
and that I would not be obliged to take the
<PB N="13" REF="30">
whole parcel, nor would I buy any of them with|out
ta&s;ting them again: he argued much to have
me buy them, &s;eeing as he &s;aid I had ta&s;ted them
before, and lik'd them very well.</P>
<P>I did &s;o, <HI>&s;aid I,</HI> but I love to have my palate
confirm one day what it approv'd the day be|fore.
Perhaps, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> you would have &s;ome
other per&s;on's judgment of them, and you are
welcome to do &s;o, Sir, with all my heart, &s;end
any body you plea&s;e; but &s;till he urg'd for a
bargain, when the per&s;on &s;ent &s;hould make his
report; and then he had his agents ready, as I
under&s;tood afterwards, to manage the per&s;ons I
&s;hould &s;end.</P>
<P>I an&s;wer'd him frankly I had no great judg|ment,
but that &s;uch as it was I ventur'd to tru&s;t
to it; I thought I had hone&s;t men to deal with,
and that I &s;hould bring no body to ta&s;te them
for me but my&s;elf.</P>
<P>THIS pleas'd him, and was what he &s;ecretly
wi&s;h'd; and now, in&s;tead of de&s;iring me to come
immediately, he told me, that &s;eeing I would
not buy without &s;eeing the goods again, and
would not go ju&s;t then, he could not be in the
way in the afternoon, and &s;o de&s;ir'd I would
defer it 'till next morning, which I readily a|greed
to.</P>
<P>IN the morning I went, but not &s;o &s;oon as I
had appointed; upon which, when I came, he
&s;eem'd offended, and &s;aid I had hinder'd him;
that he could have &s;old the whole parcel, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> I
told him 1 could not have hinder'd him, for that I
had told him he &s;hould not wait for me, but &s;ell
them to the fir&s;t good cu&s;tomer he found. He
<PB N="14" REF="31">
told me, he had indeed &s;old two or three casks,
but he would not di&s;oblige me &s;o much as to &s;ell
the whole parcel before I came. This I mention
becau&s;e he made it a kind of a bite upon me,
that I &s;hould not be alarm'd at &s;eeing the casks
di&s;plac'd in the cellar.</P>
<P>WHEN I came to ta&s;te the brandy, I began to
be &s;urpri&s;ed. I &s;aw the very &s;ame casks which
I had touch'd with the marking-iron when I was
there before, but I did not like the brandy by
any means, but did not yet &s;u&s;pect the lea&s;t foul
play.</P>
<P>I went round the whole cellar, and I could
not mark above three casks which I dur&s;t ven|ture
to buy; the re&s;t apparently &s;hew'd them|&s;elves
to be mix'd, at lea&s;t I thought &s;o. I mark|ed
out the three casks, and told him my palate
had deceived me, that the re&s;t of the brandy
was not for my turn.</P>
<P>I &s;aw the man &s;urpri&s;ed, and turn pale, and
at fir&s;t &s;eem'd to be very angry, that I &s;hould, as
he call'd it, di&s;parage the goods; that &s;ure I did
not under&s;tand brandy, and the like; and that
I &s;hould have brought &s;omebody with me that did
under&s;tand it: I an&s;wer'd coldly, that if I ventur'd
my money upon my own judgment, the hazard
was not to the &s;eller, but to the buyer, and no
body had to do with that; if I did not like his
goods, another, who&s;e judgment was better, might
like them, and &s;o there was no harm done: in
a word, he would not let me have the three
casks I had mark'd, unle&s;s I took more, and I
would take no more, &s;o we parted, but with no
&s;atisfaction on his &s;ide; and I afterwards came
<PB N="15" REF="32">
to hear that he had &s;ate up all the night with his
coopers mixing &s;pirits in every cask, whence
he drew off a quantity of the right brandy and
corrupted it, concluding, that as I had no judg|ment
to chu&s;e by but my own, I could not di&s;|cover
it; and it came out by his quarrelling
with the per&s;on who brought me to him, for
telling him I did not underder&s;tand the goods,
upon which pre&s;umption he ventur'd to &s;poil
the whole parcel.</P>
<P>I give you this &s;tory as a ju&s;t caution to a
young trade&s;man, and to &s;hew how nece&s;&s;ary
it is that a trade&s;man &s;hould have judgment in
the goods he buys, and how ea&s;ily he may be
impos'd upon and abus'd, if he offers to buy
upon his own judgment, when really it is de|fective.
I could enlarge this article with many
like examples, but I think this may &s;uffice.</P>
<P>2. THE next thing I recommend to an ap|prentice
at the conclu&s;ion of his time, is to ac|quaint
him&s;elf with his ma&s;ter's chapmen; I
mean of both kinds, as well tho&s;e he &s;ells to,
as tho&s;e he buys of; and, <HI>if he is a factor,</HI> with
his ma&s;ter's employers. But what I aim at
now is the chapmen, and cu&s;tomers whom his
ma&s;ter chiefly &s;ells to. I need not explain my
&s;elf not to mean by this the chance cu&s;tomers
of a retailer's &s;hop, for there can be no ac|quaintance,
or very little, made with them:
but, I mean the country &s;hopkeepers, or o|thers
who buy in parcels, and who buy to &s;ell
again, or export as merchandize. If the young
man comes from his ma&s;ter, and has form'd no
acquaintance or intere&s;t among the cu&s;tomers
<PB N="16" REF="33">
whom his ma&s;ter dealt with, he has in &s;hort, &s;lipt
or lo&s;t one of the principal ends and rea&s;ons of
his being an apprentice, in which he has &s;pent
&s;even years, and perhaps his friends given a
con&s;iderable &s;um of money.</P>
<P>FOR a young man coming out of his time to
have his &s;hop or warehou&s;e &s;tock'd with goods,
and his cu&s;tomers all to &s;eek, will make his
beginning infinitely more difficult to him, than
it would otherwi&s;e be; and he not only has
new cu&s;tomers to &s;eek, but has their charac|ters
to &s;eek al&s;o, and knows not who is good,
and who not, till he buys that knowledge by
his experience, and perhaps &s;ometimes pays too
dear for it.</P>
<P>IT was an odd circum&s;tance of a trade&s;man in
this city a few years ago, who being out of his
time, and going to &s;olicit one of his ma&s;ter's
cu&s;tomers to trade with him, the chapman
did not &s;o much as know him, or remember
that he had ever heard of his name, except as
he had heard his ma&s;ter call his apprentice <HI>Ja|cob.</HI>
I know &s;ome ma&s;ters diligently watch to
prevent their apprentices &s;peaking to their cu&s;|tomers,
and to keep them from acquainting
them&s;elves with the buyers, that when they
come out of their times they may not carry the
trade away with them. This method has more
cunning than hone&s;ty in it, and the ma&s;ter can
ill an&s;wer &s;uch a practice to his con&s;cience:
But as the ma&s;ter is, <HI>to be &s;ure,</HI> no fool that
does &s;o, the apprentice mu&s;t be no witch, that
does not countermine it, and prevent him.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="34">
TO hinder an apprentice from an acquaint|ance
with the dealers of both &s;orts, is &s;ome|what
like <HI>Laban</HI>'s u&s;age of <HI>Jacob, viz.</HI> keep|ing
back the beloved <HI>Rachel,</HI> whom he &s;erved
his &s;even years time for, and putting him off
with a blear-ey'd <HI>Leah</HI> in her &s;tead; it is indeed
a kind of robbing him, taking from him the ad|vantage
which he &s;erv'd his time for, and &s;end|ing
him into the world like a man out of a
&s;hip &s;et on more among &s;avages, who in&s;tead
of feeding him, are indeed more ready to eat
him up and devour him.</P>
<P>AN apprentice who has &s;erv'd out his time
faithfully and diligently, ought to claim it
as a debt to his indentures, that his ma&s;ter
&s;hould let him into an open, acquaintance with
his cu&s;tomers; he does not el&s;e perform his
promi&s;e to teach him the art and my&s;tery of his
trade; he does not make him ma&s;ter of his
bu&s;ine&s;s, or enable him as he ought to &s;et up
in the world; for as buying is indeed the fir&s;t,
&s;o &s;elling is the la&s;t end of trade, and the
faithful apprentice ought to be fully made ac|quainted
with them both.</P>
<P>3. NEXT to being acquainted with his ma&s;ter's
cu&s;tomers and chapmen, the apprentice, when
his time is near expiring, ought to acquaint
him&s;elf with the books; that is to &s;ay, to &s;ee
and learn his ma&s;ter's method of book-keeping,
that he may follow it, if the method is good,
and may learn a better method <HI>in time</HI> if it is
not.</P>
<P>THE trade&s;man &s;hould not be at a lo&s;s how
to keep his books, when he is to begin his trade;
<PB N="18" REF="35">
that would be to put him to &s;chool when he is
ju&s;t come from &s;chool; his apprentice&s;hip is, <HI>and
ought in inju&s;tice to be,</HI> a &s;chool to him, where
he ought to learn every thing that &s;hould qua|lify
him for his bu&s;ine&s;s, at lea&s;t every thing
that his ma&s;ter can teach him; and if he finds
his ma&s;ter either backward or unwilling to
reach him, he &s;hould complain in time to his
own friends, that they may &s;ome how or other
&s;upply the defect.</P>
<P>A trade&s;man's books are his repeating clook;
which upon all occa&s;ions are to tell him how
he goes on, and how things &s;tand with him in
the world; there he will know when 'tis time
to go on, or when 'tis time to give over: and
upon his regular keeping, and fully acquainting
him&s;elf with his books, depends at lea&s;t the com|fort
of his trade, if not the very trade it &s;elf.
If they are not duly po&s;ted, and if every thing
is not carefully entred in them, the debtors ac|counts
kept even, the ca&s;h con&s;tantly balanc'd,
and the credits all &s;tated, the trade&s;man is like
a &s;hip at &s;ea, &s;teer'd without a helm; he is all
in confu&s;ion, and knows not what he does, or
where he is; he may be a rich man, or a bank|rupt,
for in a word, he can give no account of
him&s;elf to him&s;elf, much le&s;s to any body el&s;e.</P>
<P>HIS books being &s;o e&s;&s;ential to his trade, he
that comes out of his time without a perfect
knowledge of the method of book-keeping,
<HI>like a bride undre&s;t,</HI> is not fit to be married;
he knows not what to do, or what &s;tep to take;
he may indeed have &s;erv'd his time, but he has
not learn'd his trade, nor is he fit to &s;et up;
<PB N="19" REF="36">
and be the fault in him&s;elf for not learning, or
in his ma&s;ter for not reaching him, he ought
not to &s;et up till he has gotten &s;ome skilful
per&s;on to put him in a way to do it, and make
him fully to under&s;tand it.</P>
<P>It is true, there is not a great deal of diffi|culty
in keeping a trade&s;man's books, e&s;pecially
if he be a retailer only; but yet even in the
meane&s;t trades, they ought to know how to
keep books: But the advice is directed to tho&s;e
who are above the retailer, as well as to them;
if the book-keeping be &s;mall, 'tis the &s;ooner
learned, and the apprentice is the more to blame
if he neglects it: Be&s;ides, the objection is much
more trifling than the advice: The trade&s;man
cannot carry on any con&s;iderable trade without
books; and he mu&s;t, during his apprentice&s;hip,
prepare him&s;elf for bu&s;ine&s;s by acquainting him|&s;elf
with every thing needful for his going on
with his trade, among which that of book|keeping
is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>4. THE la&s;t article, and in its &s;elf e&s;&s;ential
to a young trade&s;man, is to know how to buy;
if his ma&s;ter is kind and generous, he will con|&s;ider
the ju&s;tice of this part, and let him into the
&s;ecret of it of his own free will, and that before
his time is fully expir'd; but if that &s;hould not
happen, as often it does not, let the apprentice
know, that it is one of the mo&s;t needful things
to him that can belong to his apprentice&s;hip,
and that he ought not to let his time run over
his head, without getting as much in&s;ight into
it as po&s;&s;ible; that therefore he ought to lo&s;e
no opportunity to get into it, even whether
<PB N="20" REF="37">
his ma&s;ter approves of it or no; for as it is a
debt due to him from his ma&s;ter to in&s;truct him
in it, 'tis highly ju&s;t he &s;hould u&s;e all proper
means to come at it.</P>
<P>INDEED the affair in this age between ma&s;|ters
and their apprentices, &s;tands in a different
view from what the &s;ame thing was a few years
pa&s;t; the &s;tate of our apprentice&s;hip is not a
&s;tate of &s;ervitude now, and hardly of &s;ubjection,
and their behaviour is accordingly, more like
gentlemen than trade&s;men; more like compa|nions
to their ma&s;ters, than like &s;ervants. On
the other hand, the ma&s;ters &s;eem to have made
over their authority to their apprentices for a
&s;um of money; the money taken now with ap|prentices
being mo&s;t exorbitantly grear, com|pair'd
to what it was in former times.</P>
<P>NOW tho' this does not at all exempt the &s;er|vant
or apprentice from taking care of him&s;elf,
and to qualify him&s;elf for bu&s;ine&s;s while he is
an apprentice, yet it is evident that it is no
furtherance to apprentices; the liberties they take
towards the conclu&s;ion of their time, are &s;o
much employ'd to wor&s;e purpo&s;es, that appren|tices
do not come out of their times better
fini&s;h'd for bu&s;ine&s;s and trade than they did for|merly,
but much the wor&s;e: and tho' it is not
the proper bu&s;ine&s;s and de&s;ign of this work to
enlarge on the inju&s;tice done both to ma&s;ter and
&s;ervant by this change of cu&s;tom, yet to bring
it to my pre&s;ent purpo&s;e, it carries this force
with it, namely, that the advice to apprentices
to endeavour to fini&s;h them&s;elves for bu&s;ine&s;s
during the time of the indenture, is &s;o much
the more needful and &s;ea&s;onable.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="38">
NOR is this advice for the &s;ervice of the ma&s;ter, but of the apprentice; for if the apprentice neglects this advice, if he omits to qualify
him&s;elf for bu&s;ine&s;s as above; if he neither will ac|quaint
him&s;elf with the cu&s;tomers, or the books,
or with the buying part, or gain judgment in
the wares he is to deal in, the lo&s;s is his own,
not his ma&s;ter's; and indeed he may be &s;aid to
have &s;erv'd not him&s;elf, but his ma&s;ter; and both
his money and his &s;even years are all thrown away.</P>
<P>NAY, one way 'tis the ma&s;ter's advantage to
have his &s;ervant be good for nothing, the le&s;s
injury he does his ma&s;ter at his going away;
tho' an hone&s;t ma&s;ter will not de&s;ire an advan|tage
at &s;uch a price to his apprentice: But if
this was really always the ca&s;e, it would &s;till
&s;trengthen the argument; for &s;o much more
ought the apprentice to take care of him&s;elf,
and qualify him&s;elf while he is with his ma&s;ter,
that at his coming away he may do him all the
lawful mi&s;chief he can.</P>

<P>_I HAVE the favour of your letter of the
fifth in&s;tant, wherein you acquaint me
with your de&s;ign of publi&s;hing &s;ome ob|&s;ervations,
rules, and in&s;tructions for the benefit
<PB N="22" REF="39">
of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> trade&s;man, and in order to in|form
young trade&s;men in the mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary parts
of bu&s;ine&s;s, and the manner and method of our
<HI>Engli&s;h</HI> inland-trade, de&s;iring me to give you
my thoughts on the &s;ubject, and to add any
thing, which in my opinion may be u&s;eful in
the &s;aid work you are upon.</P>
<P>AS I perfectly well under&s;tand your meaning,
approve the de&s;ign, and believe it to be both u&s;e|ful
in it&s;elf, and very much wanted in this age,
when there are &s;o many raw untaught wretches,
who thru&s;t them&s;elves into bu&s;ine&s;s, and know
little or nothing of it; &s;o I &s;hall not fail to con|tribute
every thing to your a&s;&s;i&s;tance in &s;o good
a de&s;ign, that m$ capacity and experience fur|ni&s;hes
me with, and that I think may promote
the work.</P>
<P>IN order to oblige you in every part of your
reque&s;t, I &s;hall de&s;ire you to take notice, that as
one great defect of our trade&s;men is their not
knowing how to write their letters of corre|&s;pondence
in a free, plain, and trade&s;man-like
&s;tile, and to give or receive orders in terms &s;uit|able
to the nature of the thing they write about,
I &s;hall, as near as I can, put all my letters into
&s;uch a form, and choo&s;e &s;uch a &s;tile, even in
the&s;e letters to you, as &s;hall? <HI>mutatis mutandis</HI>

this &s;hould take up &s;ome of my fir&s;t letters to
you, I hope you will not think them mi&s;plac'd,
&s;eeing it is one of the fir&s;t things a trade&s;man
ought to be ma&s;ter of.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="40">
AS plainne&s;s and a free uncon&s;train'd way of
&s;peaking is the beauty and excellence of &s;peech,
&s;o an ea&s;ie free conci&s;e way of writing is the
be&s;t &s;tile for a trade&s;man. He that affects a
rumbling and bomba&s;t &s;tile, and fills his letters
with long harangues, compliments, and flou|rishes,
&s;hould turn poet in&s;tead of trade&s;man,
and &s;et up for a wit, not a &s;hopkeeper. Hark
how &s;uch a young trade&s;man writes out of
the country to his whole&s;ale man at <HI>London</HI> upon
his fir&s;t &s;etting up.</P>
<P>&startq;SIR, The de&s;tinies having &s;o appointed it,
and my dark &s;tars concurring, that I, who by
nature was fram'd for better things, &s;hould be
put out to a trade, and the gods having been
&s;o propitious to me in the time of my &s;ervi|tude,
that at length the days are expir'd, and
I am launch'd forth into the great ocean of
bu&s;ine&s;s, I thought fit to acquaint you, that
la&s;t month I receiv'd my fortune, which by
my father's will had been my due two years
pa&s;t, at which time I arriv'd to man's e&s;tate,
and became major; whereupon I have taken
a hou&s;e in one of the principal &s;treets of the
town of&mdash;where I am entred upon
my bu&s;ine&s;s, and hereby let you know that
I &s;hall have occa&s;ion for the goods hereafter
mention'd, which you may &s;end to me by the
carrier.&endq;</P>
<P>THIS fine flouri&s;h, and which no doubt the
young fellow dre&s;t up with much application,
and thought was very well done, put his cor|re&s;pondent
<PB N="24" REF="41">
in <HI>London</HI> into a fit of laughter, and
in&s;tead of &s;ending him the goods he wrote for,
put him either fir&s;t upon writing down into the
country to enquire after his character, and whe|ther
he was worth dealing with, or el&s;e it ob|tain'd
to be fil'd up among &s;uch letters as de&s;erv'd

you will think your&s;elf obliged to u&s;e me
well, and particularly that the goods may be

I repeat my de&s;ire, that you will

<P>THE &s;um of the matter is this; a trade&s;man's

no means approve of &s;tudied abbreviations, and
leaving out the needful copulatives of &s;peech
in trading letters, they are <HI>to an extreme</HI> affect|ed,
no beauty to the &s;tile, but on the contrary
a deformity of the gro&s;&s;e&s;t nature. They are
affected to the la&s;t degree, and with this aggra|vation,
that it is an affectation of the gro&s;&s;e&s;t
nature; for in a word 'tis affecting to be thought
a man of more than ordinary &s;en&s;e, by writing
extraordinary non&s;en&s;e; and affecting to be a
man of bu&s;ine&s;s by giving orders and expre&s;&s;ing
your meaning in terms which a man of bu&s;ine&s;s
may not think him&s;elf bound by: for example,

The <HI>Hambro'</HI> factor may be a &s;hip, or a hor&s;e,

&s;ea together. The roads may be <HI>Yarmouth</HI> roads
or <HI>Grimsby,</HI> or indeed any where.</P>
<P>BY &s;uch a way of writing no orders can be

explicit, and he ought to have a&s;&s;ur'd him, that
on his drawing on him his bills &s;hould be ho|nour'd,
that is, accepted and paid.</P>
<P>I know this affectation of &s;tile is accounted
very grand, looks modi&s;h, and has a kind of
maje&s;tick greatne&s;s in it; but the be&s;t merchants
in the world are come off from it, and now
choo&s;e to write plain and intelligibly; much
le&s;s &s;hould country-trade&s;men, citizens and &s;hop|keepers,
who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s is plainne&s;s and meer
trade, make u&s;e of it.</P>
<P>I have mentioned this in the beginning of this
work, becau&s;e indeed it is the beginning of a
trade&s;man's bu&s;ine&s;s. When a trade&s;man takes
an apprentice, the fir&s;t thing he does for him,
after he takes him from behind his counter, af|ter
he lets him into his compting-hou&s;e and
<PB N="28" REF="45">
his books, and after tru&s;ting him with his more
private bu&s;ine&s;s, I &s;ay the fir&s;t thing is to let
him write letters to his dealers, and corre&s;pond
with his friends; and this he does in his ma&s;|ter's
name, &s;ub&s;cribing his letters thus:</P>
<CLOSER><HI>I am,

<HI>your humble &s;ervant,</HI>
<SIGNED>C. D.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</DIV1>
<DIV1>
<Q>And beginning thus:</Q>
<P>SIR, I am order'd by my ma&s;ter <HI>A. B.</HI> to
advi&s;e you that&mdash;
Or thus:</P>
<P>SIR, By my ma&s;ter's order, I am to &s;ignify
to you that&mdash;
Or thus:</P>
<P>SIR, The&s;e are by my ma&s;ter's order to give
you notice&mdash;</P>
<P>ORDERS for goods ought to be very explicit
and particular, that the dealer may not mi&s;take,
e&s;pecially if it be orders from a trade&s;man to
a manufacturer, to make goods, or to buy goods,
either of &s;uch a quality, or to &s;uch a pattern;
in which if the goods are made to the colours,
and of a marketable goodne&s;s, and within the
time limited, the per&s;on ordering them can|not
refu&s;e to receive them, and make him&s;elf
debtor to the maker. On the contrary, if the
goods are not of a marketable goodne&s;s, or
not to the patterns, or are not &s;ent within the
time, the maker ought not to expect they &s;hould
be receiv'd. For example:</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="46">
The trade&s;man, or warehou&s;eman, or what
el&s;e we may call him, writes to his corre&s;pon|dent

<P>&startq;SIR, The goods you &s;ent me la&s;t week

&s;ort which I am at pre&s;ent full of: however,
if you are willing they &s;hould lie here, I
will take all opportunities to &s;ell them for
your account; otherwi&s;e, on your fir&s;t orders
they &s;hall be deliver'd to whoever you &s;hall
direct: and as you had no orders from me
for &s;uch &s;orts of goods, you cannot take
this ill. But I have here enclo&s;ed &s;ent you
five patterns as under markt, 1 to 5, if you
think fit to make me fifty pieces of druggets

THE clothier accordingly gives him an an&s;wer
the next po&s;t, as follows:</P>
<P>&startq;SIR, I have the favour of yours of the
22^d pa&s;t, with your order for fifty fine drug|gets,
to be made of the like weight and
goodne&s;s with the two packs, N^o A. B. which
I made for you and &s;ent la&s;t <HI>October,</HI> as al&s;o
the five patterns enclo&s;ed, marked 1 to 5, for
my direction in the mixture: I give you this
trouble, according to your order, to let you
know, I have already put the &s;aid fifty pieces
in hand, and as I am always willing to &s;erve
you to the be&s;t of my power, and am thank|ful
for your favours, you may depend upon
them within the time, that is to &s;ay, &s;ome
time in <HI>February</HI> next, and that they &s;hall be
of the like finene&s;s and &s;ub&s;tance with the
other, and as near to the patterns as po&s;&s;ible:
But in regard our poor are very craving, and
money at this time very &s;carce, I beg you
will give me leave, (twenty or thirty pieces
of them being fini&s;h'd and deliver'd to you
at any time before the remainder,) to draw
fifty pounds on you for pre&s;ent occa&s;ion; for
which I &s;hall think my &s;elf greatly oblig'd,

<P>HERE is a harmony of bu&s;ine&s;s, and every
thing exact; the order is given plain and expre&s;s;
the clothier an&s;wers directly to every point:
here can be no defect in the corre&s;pondence;
the diligent clothier applies immediately to the
work, &s;orts and dies his wool, mixes his colours
to the patterns, puts the wool to the &s;pinners, &s;ends
his yarn to the weavers, has the pieces brought
home, then has them to the thicking or fulling|mill,
dre&s;&s;es them in his own workhou&s;e, and
&s;ends them up punctually by the time; perhaps
by the middle of the month: Having &s;ent up
twenty pieces five weeks before, the ware|hou&s;ekeeper
to oblige him, pays his bill of 50 <HI>l.</HI>
and a month after the re&s;t are &s;ent in, he draws
for the re&s;t of the money, and his bills are
punctually paid. The con&s;equence of this ex|act
writing and an&s;wering is this.</P>
<P>The warehou&s;ekeeper having the order from
his merchant, is furni&s;ht in time, and obliges
his cu&s;tomer; then &s;ays he to his &s;ervant, Well,
&startq;this <HI>H. G.</HI> of the <HI>Devize</HI> is a clever work|man,
under&s;tands his bu&s;ine&s;s, and may be
depended on: I &s;ee if I have an order to
give that requires any exactne&s;s and hone&s;t
u&s;age, he is my man; he under&s;tands orders
when they are &s;ent, goes to work immedi|ately,
and an&s;wers them punctually.&endq;</P>
<P>Again, the clothier at <HI>Devize</HI> &s;ays to his head
man, or perhaps his &s;on, &startq;This Mr. <HI>H.</HI> is a very
good employer, he is worth obliging; his orders
are &s;o plain and &s;o direct a man cannot mi&s;|take,
and if the goods are made hone&s;tly
and to his time, there's one's money; bills
<PB N="32" REF="49">
are chearfully accepted, and punctually paid;
I'll never di&s;appoint him, whoever goes with|out
goods he &s;hall not.&endq;</P>
<P>On the contrary, when orders are darkly
given, they are doubtfully ob&s;erved; and when
the goods come to town, the merchant di&s;likes
them, the warehou&s;eman &s;huffles 'em back up|on
the clothier, to lie for his account, pretend|ing,
they are not made to his order; the clothier is
di&s;couraged, and for want of his money di&s;cre|dited,
and all their corre&s;pondence is confu&s;ion,
and ends in lo&s;s both of money and credit.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER III.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Trading Stile.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_IN my la&s;t I gave you my thoughts for
the in&s;truction of young trade&s;men in
writing letters with orders, and an&s;wer|ing
orders, and e&s;pecially about the proper &s;tile
of a trade&s;man's letters, which I hinted &s;hould
be plain and ea&s;y, free in language, and direct
to the purpo&s;e intended; give me leave to go
on with the &s;ubject a little farther, as I think
'tis u&s;eful in another part of the trade&s;man's cor|re&s;pondence.</P>
<P>I might have made &s;ome apology to you for
urging trade&s;men to write a plain and ea&s;y
&s;tile; let me add to you, that the trade&s;men
need not be offended at my condemning them.
<PB N="33" REF="50">
<HI>as it were</HI> to a plain and homely &s;tile; ea&s;y,
plain, and familiar language is the beauty of
&s;peech in general, and is the excellency of all
writing, on whatever &s;ubject, or to whatever
per&s;ons they are we write or &s;peak. The end of
&s;peech is that men might under&s;tand one ano|ther's
meaning; certainly that &s;peech, or that
way of &s;peaking which is mo&s;t ea&s;ily under|&s;tood,
is the be&s;t way of &s;peaking. If any man
was to ask me, which would be &s;uppo&s;ed to be
a perfect &s;tile, or language, I would an&s;wer,
that in which a man &s;peaking to five hundred
people, of all common and various capacities,
idiots or lunaticks excepted, &s;hould be under|&s;tood
by them all in the &s;ame manner with
one another, and in the &s;ame &s;en&s;e which the
&s;peaker intended to be under&s;tood, this would
certainly be a mo&s;t perfect &s;tile.</P>
<P>ALL exotic &s;ayings, dark and ambiguous &s;peak|ings,
affected words, and as I &s;aid in my la&s;t,
abridgment, or words cut off, as they are fool|i&s;h
and improper in bu&s;ine&s;s, &s;o indeed are
they in any other things; hard words and af|fectation
of &s;tile in bu&s;ine&s;s, is like bomba&s;t in
poetry, a kind of rumbling non&s;en&s;e, and no|thing
of the kind can be more ridiculous.</P>
<P>THE nicety of writing in bu&s;ine&s;s, con&s;i&s;ts
chiefly, in giving every &s;pecies of goods their
trading names; for there are certain peculiari|ties
in the trading language, which are to be
ob&s;erv'd as the greate&s;t proprieties, and without
which the language your letters are written in
would be ob&s;cure, and the trade&s;men you wrire
to would not under&s;tand you; for example, if
<PB N="34" REF="51">
you write to your factor at <HI>Lisbon,</HI> or at <HI>Cadiz,</HI>
to make your returns in <HI>hard ware,</HI> he under|&s;tands
you, and &s;ends you &s;o many bags of
pieces of eight. So if a merchant comes to
me to hire a &s;mall &s;hip of me, and tells me
'tis for the pipin trade; or to buy a ve&s;&s;el, and
tells me he intends to make a <HI>pipiner</HI> of her,
the meaning is, that &s;he is to run to <HI>Seville</HI>
for oranges, or to <HI>Malaga</HI> for lemons. If
he &s;ays he intends to &s;end her for a lading
of fruit, the meaning is, &s;he is to go to <HI>Ali|cant,
Denia,</HI> or <HI>Xevia,</HI> on the coa&s;t of <HI>Spain,</HI>
for rai&s;ins of the &s;un, or to <HI>Malaga</HI> for <HI>Mala|ga</HI>
rai&s;ins. Thus in the home trade in <HI>England,</HI>
if in <HI>Kent</HI> a man tells me he is to go among
the <HI>night riders,</HI> his meaning is he is to go a
carrying wool to the &s;ea-&s;hore; the people that
u&s;ually run the wool off in boats, are called
<HI>owlers;</HI> tho&s;e that &s;teal cu&s;toms, &s;mugglers;
and the like. In a word, there is a kind of
a cant in trade, which a trade&s;man ought to
know, as the beggars and &s;trollers know the
gyp&s;y cant, which none can &s;peak but them|&s;elves;
and this in letters of bu&s;ine&s;s is allow|able,
and indeed they cannot under&s;tand one
another without it.</P>
<P>A brickmaker being hired by a brewer to
make &s;ome bricks for him at his country-hou&s;e,
wrote to the brewer that he could not go for|ward
unle&s;s he had two or three load of <HI>&s;pa|ni&s;h;</HI>
and that otherwi&s;e his bricks would co&s;t
him &s;ix or &s;even chaldron of coals extraordi|nary,
and the bricks would not be &s;o good and
hard neither by a great deal, when, they were
burnt.</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="52">
THE brewer &s;ends him an an&s;wer, that he
&s;hould go on as well as he could for three or
four days, and then the <HI>&s;pani&s;h</HI> &s;hould be &s;ent
him: accordingly, the following week the
brewer &s;ends him down, two carts loaded with
about twelve hog&s;heads or casks of <HI>mola&s;&s;es;</HI>
which frighted the brickmaker almo&s;t out of
his &s;en&s;es. The ca&s;e was this, the brewers for|merly
mixt <HI>mola&s;&s;es</HI> with their ale, to &s;weeten
it, and abate the quantity of malt, <HI>mola&s;&s;es</HI> be|ing
at that time much cheaper, in proportion;
and this they call'd <HI>&s;pani&s;h,</HI> not being willing
that people &s;hould know it. Again, the brick|makers
all about <HI>London,</HI> do mix &s;ea-coal|a&s;hes,
or lay&s;tal-&s;tuff, as we call it, with their
clay of which they make brick, and by that
&s;hift &s;ave eight chaldron of coals out of ele|ven,
in proportion to what other people u&s;e
to burn them with; and the&s;e a&s;hes they call
<HI>&s;pani&s;h.</HI></P>
<P>Thus the receiv'd terms of art in every par|ticular
bu&s;ine&s;s are to be ob&s;erved; of which I
&s;hall &s;peak to you in its turn: I name them
here to intimate, that when I am &s;peaking of
plain writing in matters of bu&s;ine&s;s, it mu&s;t be
under&s;tood with an allowance for all the&s;e
things: and a trade&s;man mu&s;t be not only al|lowed
to u&s;e them in his &s;tile, but cannot
write proper without them; it is a particular
excellence in a trade&s;man to be able to know
all the terms of art in every &s;eparate bu&s;ine&s;s,
&s;o as to be able to &s;peak or write to any par|ticular
handicraft or manufacturer in his own
dialect; and it is as necc&s;&s;ary as it is for a &s;ea|man
<PB N="36" REF="53">
to under&s;tand the names of all the &s;everal
things belonging to a &s;hip.</P>
<P>THIS therefore is not to be under&s;tood when
I &s;ay that a trade&s;man &s;hould write plain and
explicit, for the&s;e things belong to, and are part
of the language of trade.</P>
<P>BUT even the&s;e terms of art, or cu&s;tomary
expre&s;&s;ions, are not to be u&s;ed with affectation,
and with a needle&s;s repetition, where they are
not called for.</P>
<P>NOR &s;hould a trade&s;man write tho&s;e <HI>out of
the way</HI> words, tho' 'tis in the way of the bu&s;i|ne&s;s
he writes about, to any other per&s;on, who
he knows, or has rea&s;on to believe, does not
under&s;tand them; I &s;ay, he ought not to write
in tho&s;e terms to &s;uch, becau&s;e it &s;hews a kind
of o&s;tentation, and a triumph over the ignorance
of the per&s;on they are written to, unle&s;s at the
very &s;ame time you add an explanation of the
terms, &s;o as to make them a&s;&s;uredly intelligible
at the place, and to the per&s;on to whom they
are &s;ent.</P>
<P>A trade&s;man, in &s;uch ca&s;es, like a par&s;on,
&s;hould &s;uit his language to his auditory; and it
would be as ridiculous for a trade&s;man to write
a letter fill'd with the peculiarities of this or
that particular trade, which trade he knows the
per&s;on he writes to is ignorant of, and the
terms whereof he is unacquainted with, as it
would be for a mini&s;ter to quote <HI>Chry&s;o&s;tome</HI>
and St. <HI>Au&s;tin,</HI> and repeat at large all their
&s;ayings in the <HI>Greek</HI> and the <HI>Latin,</HI> in a coun|try
church among a parcel of plowmen and far|mers.
Thus a &s;ailor writing a letter to a &s;ur|geon,
<PB N="37" REF="54">
told him he had a &s;welling on the North|Ea&s;t
&s;ide of his face, that his windward leg be|ing
hurt by a brui&s;e, it &s;o put him out of trim
that he always heel'd to &s;tarboard when he made
fre&s;h way, and &s;o run to leeward till he was
often, forced aground; then he de&s;ired him to
give him &s;ome directions how to put him&s;elf
into a &s;ailing po&s;ture again. Of all which the
&s;urgeon under&s;tood little more than that he
had a &s;welling on his face, and a brui&s;e in his
leg.</P>
<P>IT would be a very happy thing, if trade&s;men
had all their <HI>lexicon technicum</HI> at their fingers
ends; I mean, (for pray remember that <HI>I ob|&s;erve
my own rule,</HI> not to u&s;e <HI>a hard word with|out
explaining it,</HI>) that every trade&s;man would
&s;tudy &s;o the terms of art of other trades, that
he might be able to &s;peak to every manufacturer
or arti&s;t in his own language, and under&s;tand
them when they talk'd one to another; this
would make trade be a kind of univer&s;al lan|guage,
and the particular marks they are oblig'd
to, would be like the notes of mu&s;ic, an uni|ver&s;al
character, in which all the trade&s;men in
<HI>England</HI> might write to one another in the
language and characters of their &s;everal trades,
and be as intelligible to one another as the
mini&s;ter is to his people, <HI>and perhaps much
more.</HI></P>
<P>I therefore recommend it to every young
trade&s;man to take all occa&s;ions to conver&s;e with
mechanicks of every kind, and to learn the
particular language of their bu&s;ine&s;s; not the
names of their tools only, and the way of
<PB N="38" REF="55">
working with their in&s;truments as well as hands;
but the very cant of their trade, for every trade
has its <HI>no&s;trums,</HI> and its little made words,
which they often pride them&s;elves in, and
which yet are u&s;eful to them on &s;ome occa&s;ion
or other.</P>
<P>THERE are many advantages to a trade&s;man
in thus having a general knowledge of the
terms of art, and the cant, as I call it, of every
bu&s;ine&s;s; and particularly this, that they could
not be impo&s;ed upon to ea&s;ily by other trade&s;|men,
when they came to deal with them.</P>
<P>IF you come to deal with a trade&s;man or
handicraft&s;man, and talk his own language to
him, he pre&s;ently &s;uppo&s;es you under&s;tand his
bu&s;ine&s;s; that you know what you come about;
that you have judgment in his goods, or in his
art, and cannot ea&s;ily be impos'd upon; accord|ingly
he treats you like a man that is not to
be cheated, comes clo&s;e to the point, and does
not croud you with words, and rattling talk to
&s;et out his wares, and to cover their defects;
he finds you know where to look or feel for
the defect of things, and how to judge of their
worth. For example:</P>
<P>What trade has more hard words and pecu|liar
ways attending it, than that of a jockey, or
hor&s;e-cour&s;er, as we call them? have they all the
parts of the hor&s;e, and all the di&s;ea&s;es attend|ing
him, necc&s;&s;ary to be mentioned in the mar|ket
upon every occa&s;ion of buying or bargain|ing:
A jockey will know you at fir&s;t &s;ight, when
you do but go round a hor&s;e, or at the fir&s;t
word you &s;ay about him, whether you are a
<PB N="39" REF="56">
dealer, as they call them&s;elves, or a &s;tranger. If
you begin well, if you take up the hor&s;e's foot
right, if you handle him in the proper places,
if you bid his &s;ervant open his mouth, or go
about it your &s;elf like a workman, if you &s;peak
of his &s;hapes or goings in the proper words;
O, &s;ays the jockey to his fellow, he under&s;tands
a hor&s;e, he &s;peaks the language; then he knows
you are not to be cheated, or at lea&s;t not &s;o ea|&s;ily:
but if you go aukwardly to work, whi&s;per
to your man you bring with you, to ask every
thing for you, cannot handle the hor&s;e your
&s;elf, or &s;peak the language of the trade, he falls
upon you with his flouri&s;hes, and with a flux
of hor&s;e-rhetorick impo&s;es upon you with oaths
and a&s;&s;everations, and, in a word, conquers you
with the meer clamour of his trade.</P>
<P>THUS if you go to a garden to buy flowers,
plants, trees and greens, if you know what you
go about, know the names of flowers, or &s;im|ples,
or greens; know the particular beauties
of them, when they are fit to remove, and
when to &s;lip and draw, and when not; what
colour is ordinary, and what rare; when a
flower is rare, and when ordinary; the gardener
pre&s;ently talks to you as to a man of art, tells
you that you are a lover of art, a friend to a
flori&s;t, &s;hews you his exoticks, his green-hou&s;e,
and his &s;tores; what he has &s;et out, and what
he has budded or inarch'd, and the like: but if
he finds you have none of the terms of art,
know little or nothing of the names of plants,
or the nature of planting, he picks your pocket
in&s;tantly, &s;hews you a fine trimm'd fuz-bu&s;h for a
<PB N="40" REF="57">
juniper, &s;ells you common pinks for painted
ladies, an ordinary tulip for a rarity, and the
like: Thus I &s;aw a gardener &s;ell a gentleman
a large yellow auriculas, that is to &s;ay, <HI>a run|ning
away,</HI> for a curious flower, and take a great
price; it &s;eems the gentleman was a lover of a
good yellow, and 'tis known that when nature
in the auricula is exhau&s;ted, and has &s;pent her
&s;trength in &s;hewing a fine flower, perhaps &s;ome
years upon the &s;ame root, &s;he faints at la&s;t, and
then turns into a yellow, which yellow &s;hall be
bright and plea&s;ant the fir&s;t year, and look ve|ry
well to one that knows nothing of it, tho'
another year it turns pale, and at length almo&s;t
white: This the gardeners call a run flower,
and this they put upon the gentleman for a
rarity, only becau&s;e he di&s;cover'd at his coming
that he knew nothing of the matter. The &s;ame
gardener &s;old another per&s;on a root of white
painted thyme for the right <HI>Marum Syriacum,</HI>
and thus they do every day.</P>
<P>A per&s;on goes into a brickmaker's field to
view his clamp, and buy a load of bricks; he
re&s;olves to &s;ee them loaded becau&s;e he would
have good ones; but not under&s;tanding the
goods, and &s;eeing the workmen loading them
where they were hard and well burnt, but look'd
white and grey, which to be &s;ure were the be&s;t
of the bricks, and which perhaps they would
not have done if he had not been there to look
on them, they &s;uppo&s;ing he under&s;tood which
were the be&s;t; but he in the abundance of his
ignorance finds fault with them, becau&s;e they
were not a good colour, and did not look red,
<PB N="41" REF="58">
the brickmaker's men took the hint immediately,
and telling the buyer they would give him red
bricks to oblige him, turn'd their hands from
the grey hard well-burnt bricks to the &s;oft<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Sammell</HI> is a term of art the brick-makers u&s;e for tho&s;e bricks which are not well-burnt, and which generally look of a pale red colour, and as fair as the other, but are &s;oft.</NOTE> <HI>&s;am|mell</HI>
half-burnt bricks, which they were glad to
di&s;po&s;e of, and which no body that had under|&s;tood
them, would have taken off their hands.</P>
<P>I mention the&s;e lower things, becau&s;e I would
&s;uit my writing to the understanding of the
meane&s;t people, and &s;peak of frauds u&s;ed in the
mo&s;t ordinary trades; but it is the like in al|mo&s;t
all the goods a trade&s;man can deal in. If
you go to <HI>Warwick&s;hire</HI> to buy chee&s;e, you de|mand
the chee&s;e of the fir&s;t make, becau&s;e that
is the be&s;t. If you go to <HI>Suffolk</HI> to buy butter,
you refu&s;e the butter of the fir&s;t make, becau&s;e
that is not the be&s;t, but you bargain for the right
rowing butter, which is the butter that is made
when the cows are turn'd into the grounds where
the gra&s;s has been mow'd, and the hay carried
off, and grown again, and &s;o in many other
ca&s;es; The&s;e things demon&s;trate the advantages
there are to a trade&s;man, in his being thoroughly
inform'd of the terms of art, and the peculiari|ties
belonging to every particular bu&s;ine&s;s, which
therefore I call the language of trade.</P>
<P>AS a merchant &s;hould under&s;tand all langua|ges,
at lea&s;t, the languages of tho&s;e countries
which he trades to, or corre&s;ponds with, and
<PB N="42" REF="59">
the cu&s;toms and u&s;ages of tho&s;e countries as to
their commerce; &s;o an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> trade&s;man ought
to under&s;tand all the languages of trade, within
the circumference of his own country at lea&s;t,
and particularly of &s;uch, as he may by any of
the con&s;equences of his commerce, come to be
any way concern'd with.</P>
<P>ESPECIALLY it is his bu&s;ine&s;s to acquaint him|&s;elf

<HEAD>LETTER IV.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Trade&s;man acquainting him&s;elf with
all bu&s;ine&s;s in general.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_I AM very glad that what I have written
you in my former letters, for the in&s;tru|ction
of young trade&s;men, &s;uits your de|&s;ign.
I have, according to your reque&s;t, per&s;ued
the &s;ubject in another letter, which I hope will
be equally to your &s;ati&s;faction.</P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="60">
IT is the judgment of &s;ome experienced trade&s;|men,
that no man ought to go from one bu&s;i|ne&s;s
to another, and launch out of the trade or
employment he was bred to; <HI>Tractent fabrilia
fabri,</HI> Every man to his own bu&s;ine&s;s: and they
tell us men never thrive when they do &s;o.</P>
<P>I will not enter into that di&s;pute here. I
know &s;ome very good and encouraging exam|ples
of the contrary, and which &s;tand as re|markable
in&s;tances, or as exceptions to the ge|neral
rule: But let that be as it will; &s;ometimes
providence eminently calls men out of one em|ploy
into another, out of a &s;hop into a ware|hou&s;e,
out of a warehouse into a &s;hop, out of
a &s;ingle hand into a partner&s;hip, and the like;
and they trade one time here, another time
there, and with very good &s;ucce&s;s too. But I
&s;ay, be that as it will, a trade&s;man ought &s;o
far to acquaint him&s;elf with bui&s;ine&s;s, that he
&s;hould not be at a lo&s;s to turn his hand to this
or that trade, as occa&s;ion pre&s;ents, whether in
or out of the way of his ordinary dealing, as we
have often &s;een done in <HI>London</HI> and other pla|ces,
and &s;ometimes with good &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>THIS acquainting him&s;elf with bu&s;ine&s;s does
not intimate that he &s;hould learn every trade, or
enter into the my&s;tery of every employment;
that cannot well be; but that he &s;hould have a
true notion of bu&s;ine&s;s in general, and a know|ledge
how and in what manner it is carried on;
that he &s;hould know where every manufacture
is made, and how bought at fir&s;t hand; that he
&s;hould know which are the proper markets, and
what the particular kinds of goods to exchange
<PB N="44" REF="61">
at tho&s;e markets; that he &s;hould know the man|ner
how every manufacture is managed, and the
method of their &s;ale.</P>
<P>IT cannot be expected that he &s;hould have
judgment in the choice of all kinds of goods,
though in a great many he may have judgment
too; but there is a general under&s;tanding in
trade, which every trade&s;man both may and
ought to arrive to; and this perfectly qualifies
him to engage in any new undertaking, and
to embark with other per&s;ons better qualified
than him&s;elf, in any new trade which he was not
in before; in which, tho' he may not have a
particular knowledge and judgment in the goods
they are to deal in, or to make; yet having the
benefit of the knowledge his new partner is
ma&s;ter of, and being him&s;elf apt to take in all
additional lights, he &s;oon becomes experienc'd,
and the knowledge of all the other parts of bu|&s;ine&s;s
qualifies him to be a &s;ufficient partner; for
example, <HI>A. B.</HI> was bred a dry-&s;alter, and he
goes in partner with <HI>C. D.</HI> a &s;carlet-dyer, cal|led
a bow-dyer, at <HI>Wand&s;worth.</HI></P>
<P>AS a &s;alter, <HI>A. B.</HI> has had experience enough
in the materials for dying, as well &s;carlets as all
other colours, and under&s;tands very well the buy|ing
of cocheneal, indigo, gauls, &s;humach, log|wood,
fu&s;tick, madder, and the like; &s;o that he
does his part very well. <HI>C. D.</HI> is an experien|ced
&s;carlet-dyer, but now doubling their &s;tock,
they fall into a larger work, and they dye bays
and &s;tuffs and other goods into differing colours,
as occa&s;ion requires; and this brings them to
an equality in the bu&s;ine&s;s, and by hiring good
<PB N="45" REF="62">
experienced &s;ervants, they go on very well to|gether.</P>
<P>THE like happens often when a trade&s;man
turns his hand from one trade to another; and
when he embarks, either in partner&s;hip or out
of it, in any new bu&s;ine&s;s, 'tis &s;uppos'd he &s;el|dom
changes hands in &s;uch a manner without
&s;ome &s;uch &s;uitable per&s;on to join with, or that
he has &s;ome experienced head work-man to di|rect
him, which, if that work-man proves hone&s;t,
is as well as a partner. On the other hand, his
own application and indefatigable indu&s;try &s;up|plies
the want of judgment: Thus I have known
&s;everal trade&s;men turn their hands from one bu|&s;ine&s;s
to another, or from one trade entirely to
another, and very often with good &s;ucce&s;s; for
example, I have &s;een a confectioner turn a &s;ugar|baker,
another a di&s;tiller; an apothecary turn
chymi&s;t, and not a few turn phy&s;icians, and prove
very good phy&s;icians too, but that is a &s;tep be|yond
what I am &s;peaking of.</P>
<P>BUT my argument turns upon this (<HI>viz.</HI>) that
a trade&s;man ought to be able to turn his hand
to any thing; that is to &s;ay, to lay down one trade,
and take up another, if occa&s;ion leads him to it,
and if he &s;ees an evident view of profit and ad|vantage
in it; and this is only done by his hav|ing
a general knowledge of trade, &s;o as to have a
capacity of judging, and by but ju&s;t looking upon
what is offer'd or propo&s;ed, he &s;ees as much at
fir&s;t view as others do by long enquiry, and with
the judgment of many advi&s;ers.</P>
<P>WHEN I am thus &s;peaking of the trade&s;man's
being capable of making a judgment of things,
<PB N="46" REF="63">
it occurs with a force not to be re&s;i&s;ted, that I
&s;hould add, he is hereby &s;enced again&s;t bubbles
and projects, and again&s;t tho&s;e fatal people call'd
projectors, who are indeed among trade&s;men as
birds of prey are among the innocent fowls, (<HI>viz.</HI>)
devourers and de&s;troyers: A trade&s;man cannot
be too well arm'd, nor too much caution'd a|gain&s;t
tho&s;e &s;ort of people; they are con&s;tantly
&s;urrounded with them, and are as much in jeo|pardy
from them, as a man in a croud is of
having his pocket pick'd, nay almo&s;t as a man
is when in a croud of pick-pockets.</P>
<P>NOTHING &s;ecures the trade&s;man again&s;t tho&s;e
men &s;o well, as his being throughly knowing in
bu&s;ine&s;s, having a judgment to weigh all the
delu&s;ive &s;chemes and the fine promi&s;es of the
wheedling projector, and to &s;ee which are like|ly
to an&s;wer, or which not; to examine all his
&s;pecious pretences, his calculations and figures,
and &s;ee whether they are as likely to an&s;wer the
end, as he takes upon him to &s;ay they will; to
make allowances for all his fine flouri&s;hes and
out&s;ides, and then to judge for him&s;elf: A pro|jector,
is to a trade&s;man a kind of incendiary;
he is in a con&s;tant plot to blow him up, or &s;et
fire to him; for projects are generally as fatal to
a trade&s;man, as fire in a magazine of gun-pow|der.</P>
<P>THE hone&s;t trade&s;man is always in danger,
and cannot be too wary; and therefore to for|tify
his judgment, that he may be able to guard
again&s;t &s;uch people as the&s;e, is one of the mo&s;t
nece&s;&s;ary things I can do for him.</P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="64">
IN order then to direct the trade&s;man how to
furni&s;h him&s;elf thus with a needful &s;tock of tra|ding
knowledge, fir&s;t, I &s;hall propo&s;e to him
to conver&s;e with trade&s;men chiefly: he that will
be a trade&s;man &s;hould confine him&s;elf within
his own &s;phere: never was the gazette &s;o full of
the adverti&s;ements of commi&s;&s;ions of bankrupt
as &s;ince our &s;hop-keepers are &s;o much engaged
in parties, form'd into clubs to hear news, and
read journals and politicks; in &s;hort, when
trade&s;men turn &s;tate&s;men, they &s;hould either
&s;hut up their &s;hops, or hire &s;omebody el&s;e to
look after them.</P>
<P>THE known &s;tory of the uphol&s;terer is very
in&s;tructive, who, in his abundant concern for the
publick, run him&s;elf out of his bu&s;ine&s;s into a
jayl; and even when he was in pri&s;on, could
not &s;leep for the concern he had for the liber|ties
of his dear country: the man was a good
patriot, but a bad &s;hop-keeper; and indeed &s;hould
rather have &s;hut up his &s;hop, and got a commi&s;|&s;ion
in the army, and then he had &s;erved his
country in the way of his calling. But I may
&s;peak to this more in its turn.</P>
<P>MY pre&s;ent &s;ubject is not the negative, what he
&s;hould not do, but the affirmative, what he &s;hould
do: <HI>I &s;ay,</HI> he &s;hould take all occa&s;ions to con|ver&s;e
within the circuit of his own &s;phere, that
is, dwell upon the &s;ubect of trade in his con|ver&s;ation,
and &s;ort with and conver&s;e among
trade&s;men as much as he can; as writing teach|es
to write, <HI>&s;cribendo di&s;cis &s;cribere,</HI> &s;o conver|ging
among trade&s;men will make him a trade&s;|man.
I need not explain this &s;o critically as to
<PB N="48" REF="65">
tell you I do not mean he &s;hould confine or re|&s;train
him&s;elf entirely from ail manner of con|ver&s;ation
but among his own cla&s;s: I &s;hall &s;peak
to that in its place al&s;o. A trade&s;man may on
occa&s;ion keep company with gentlemen as well
as other people; nor is a trading man, if he is a
man of &s;en&s;e, un&s;uitable or unprofitable for a
gentleman to conver&s;e with, as occa&s;ion requires;
and you will often find, that not private gentle|men
only, but even, mini&s;ters of &s;tate, privy|coun&s;ellors,
members of parliament, and per|&s;ons
of all ranks in the government, find it for
their purpo&s;e to conver&s;e with trade&s;men, and
are not a&s;ham'd to acknowledge, that a trade&s;|man
is &s;ometimes qualified to inform them in
the mo&s;t difficult and intricate, as well as the
mo&s;t urgent affairs of government; and this has
been the rea&s;on, why &s;o marry trade&s;men have
been advanc'd to honours and dignities above
their ordinary rank, as Sir <HI>Charles Duncombe,</HI>
a gold&s;mith; Sir <HI>Henry Furne&s;e,</HI> who was ori|ginally
a retail <HI>ho&s;ier;</HI> Sir <HI>Charles Cook,</HI> late one
of the board of trade, a <HI>merchant;</HI> Sir <HI>Jo&s;iah
Child,</HI> originally a very mean trade&s;man; the
late Mr. <HI>Lowndes,</HI> bred a <HI>&s;crivener;</HI> and many
others too many to name.</P>
<P>BUT the&s;e are in&s;tances of men call'd out of
their lower &s;phere for their eminent u&s;efulne&s;s,
and their known capacities, being fir&s;t known
to be diligent and indu&s;trious men in their
private and lower &s;pheres; &s;uch advancements
make good the words of the wi&s;e man, <HI>See&s;t
$word$ a man diligent in bu&s;ine&s;s, he &s;hall &s;tand
$word$, he &s;hall not &s;tand before mean men.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="49" REF="66">
IN the mean time the trade&s;man's proper bu|&s;ine&s;s
is in his &s;hop or warehou&s;e, and among
his own cla&s;s or rank of people; there he &s;ees
how other men go on, and there he learns how
to go on him&s;elf; there he &s;ees how other men
thrive, and learns to thrive him&s;elf; there he
hears all the trading news, as for &s;tate news and
politicks, 'tis none of his bu&s;ine&s;s; there he
learns how to buy, and there he gets oftentimes
opportunities to &s;ell; there he hears of all the
di&s;a&s;ters in trade, who breaks, and why; what
brought &s;uch, and &s;uch a man to mi&s;fortunes and
di&s;a&s;ters; and &s;ees the various ways how men
go down in the world, as well as the arts and
management, by which others from nothing ri&s;e
to wealth and e&s;tates.</P>
<P>HERE he &s;ees the &s;cripture it&s;elf thwarted,
and his neighbour trade&s;man, a whole&s;ale ha|berda&s;her,
in &s;pight of a good under&s;tanding,
in &s;pight of a good beginning, and in &s;pight
of the mo&s;t indefatigable indu&s;try, &s;ink in his
circum&s;tances, lo&s;e his credit, then his &s;tock, and
then break and become bankrupt, while the
man takes more pains to be poor, than others
do to grow rich.</P>
<P>THERE on the other hand he &s;ees <HI>G. D.</HI>
a plodding weak-headed, but laborious wretch,
of a confin'd genius, and that can't look a quar|ter
of a mile from his &s;hop-door into the world,
and beginning with little or nothing, yet ri&s;es
apace in the meer road of bu&s;ine&s;s, in which he
goes on like the miller's hor&s;e, who being tied
to the po&s;t is turn'd round by the very wheel,
which he turns round him&s;elf; and this fellow
<PB N="52" REF="67">
&s;hall get money in&s;en&s;ibly, and grow rich even
he knows not how, and no body el&s;e knows
why.</P>
<P>HERE he &s;ees <HI>F. M.</HI> ruin'd by too much
trade, and there he &s;ees <HI>M. F.</HI> &s;tarv'd for want
of trade, and from all the&s;e ob&s;ervations he may
learn &s;omething u&s;eful to him&s;elf, and fit to
guide his own mea&s;ures, that he may not fall
into the &s;ame mi&s;chiefs which he &s;ees others &s;ink
under, and that he may take the advantage of
that prudence which others ri&s;e by.</P>
<P>ALL the&s;e things will naturally occur to him
in his conver&s;ing among his fellow-trade&s;men;
a &s;ettled little &s;ociety of trading people, who
under&s;tand bu&s;ine&s;s, and are carrying on trade
in the &s;ame manner with him&s;elf, no matter
whether they are of the very &s;ame trades, or no,
and perhaps better not of the &s;ame, &s;uch a &s;o|ciety,
I &s;ay, &s;hall, if due ob&s;ervations are made
from it, teach the trade&s;man more, than his ap|prentice&s;hip;
for there he learnt the operation,
here he learns the progre&s;&s;ion; his apprentice|&s;hip
is his grammar-&s;chool, this is his univer|&s;ity;
behind his ma&s;ter's counter, or in his ware|hou&s;e,
he learnt the fir&s;t rudiments of trade, but
here he learns the trading &s;ciences; here he comes
to learn the <HI>arcana,</HI> &s;peak the language, under&s;tand
the meaning of every thing, of which before he
only learnt the beginning: the apprentice&s;hip
inducts him, and leads him as the nur&s;e the child;
this fini&s;hes him; there he learnt the beginning
of trade, here he &s;ees it in its full extent; in a
word, there he learnt to trade, here he is made a
<HI>complete trade&s;man.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="49" REF="68">
LET no young trade&s;man object, that in the
conver&s;ation I &s;peak of, there is &s;o many gro&s;s
things &s;aid, and &s;o many ridiculous things ar|gued
upon, there being always a great many weak
empty heads among the &s;hop-keeping trading
world: this may be granted without any im|peachment
of what I have advanced; for where
&s;hall a man conver&s;e, and find no fools in the
&s;ociety? and where &s;hall he hear the weightie&s;t
things debated, and not a great many empty weak
things offer'd, out of which nothing can be learn|ed,
and from which nothing can be deduced,
for <HI>ex nihil nihilo fit?</HI></P>
<P>BUT notwith&s;tanding let me &s;till in&s;i&s;t upon
it to the trade&s;man to keep company with trade&s;|men;
let the fool run on in his own way; let
the talkative green-apron rattle in his own way;
let the manufacturer and his factor &s;quabble and
brangle; the grave &s;elf-conceited puppy, who
was born a boy, and will die before he is a man,
chatter and &s;ay a great deal of nothing, and talk
his neighbours to death; out of every one you
will learn &s;omething; they are all trade&s;men,
and there is always &s;omething for a young trade&s;|man
to learn from them.</P>
<P>IF under&s;tanding but a little <HI>French,</HI> you were
to conver&s;e every day a little among &s;ome
<HI>Frenchmen</HI> in your neighbourhood, and &s;uppo&s;e
tho&s;e <HI>Frenchmen,</HI> you thus kept company with,
were every one of them fools, meer, ignorant,
empty, fooli&s;h fellows; there might be nothing
learnt from their &s;en&s;e, but you'd &s;till learn <HI>French</HI>
from 'em, if it was no more than the tone and
accent, and the ordinary words u&s;ual in conver|&s;ation.</P>
<P><PB N="52" REF="69">
THUS among your &s;illy empty trade&s;men, let
them be as fooli&s;h and empty other ways as you
can &s;ugge&s;t, tho' you can learn no philo&s;ophy
from them, you may learn many things in trade
from them, and &s;omething from every one;
for tho' it is not ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary that every
trade&s;man &s;hould be a philo&s;opher, yet every
trade&s;man in his way knows &s;omething that e|ven
a philo&s;opher may learn from.</P>
<P>I knew a philo&s;opher that was excellently
skill'd in the noble &s;cience or &s;tudy of a&s;trono|my,
who told me he had &s;ome years &s;tudied for
&s;ome &s;imily, or proper allu&s;ion, to explain to
his &s;cholars the phenomena of the &s;un's motion
round its own axis, and could never happen up|on
one to his mind, 'till by accident he &s;aw his
maid <HI>Betty</HI> trundling her mop: &s;urpris'd with
the exactne&s;s of the motion to de&s;cribe the thing
he wanted, he goes into his &s;tudy, calls his pu|pils
about him, and tells them that <HI>Betty,</HI> who
her&s;elf knew nothing of the matter, could &s;hew
them the &s;un revolving about it&s;elf in a more
lively manner than ever he could. According|ly
<HI>Betty</HI> was call'd, and bad bring out her mop,
when placing his &s;cholars in a due po&s;ition, op|po&s;ite
not to the face of the maid, but to her
left &s;ide, &s;o that they could &s;ee the end of the
mop, when it wh$rl'd round upon her arm; they
took it immediately; there was the broad headed
nail in the center, which was as the body of the
&s;un, and the thrums whisking round, flinging
the water about every way by innumerable little
&s;treams, de&s;cribing exactly the rays of the &s;un
darting light from the center no the whole &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P><PB N="53" REF="70">
IF ignorant <HI>Betty,</HI> by the natural con&s;equence
of her operation in&s;tructed the a&s;tronomer, why
may not the meane&s;t &s;hoemaker or pedlar, by
the ordinary &s;agacity of his trading wit, tho' it
may be indeed very ordinary, coar&s;e and un|look'd
for, communicate &s;omething, give &s;ome
u&s;eful hint, dart &s;ome &s;udden thought into the
mind of the ob&s;erving trade&s;man, which he
&s;hall make his u&s;e of, and apply to his own ad|vantage
in trade, when at the &s;ame time he that
gives &s;uch hint &s;hall him&s;elf, like <HI>Betty</HI> and her
mop, know nothing of the matter?</P>
<P>EVERY trade&s;man is &s;uppo&s;ed to manage his
bu&s;ine&s;s his own way; and generally &s;peaking
mo&s;t trade&s;men have &s;ome ways peculiar and
particular to them&s;elves; which they either de|rived
from the ma&s;ters who taught them, or
from the experience of things, or from &s;ome|thing
in the cour&s;e of their bu&s;ine&s;s, which had
not happen'd to them before.</P>
<P>AND tho&s;e little <HI>no&s;trums</HI> are oftentime very
properly, and with advantage communicated
from one to another; one trade&s;man finds out
a nearer way of buying than another, another
finds a vent for what is bought beyond what
his neighbour knows of, and the&s;e in time
come to be learned of them by their ordinary
conver&s;ation.</P>
<P>I am not for confining the trade&s;man from
keeping better company, as occa&s;ion and lei&s;ure
requires; I allow the trade&s;man to act the gen|tleman
&s;ometimes, and that even for conver&s;a|tion,
at lea&s;t if his under&s;tanding and capaci|ty
make him &s;uitable company to them; but
<PB N="56" REF="71">
&s;till his bu&s;ine&s;s is among tho&s;e of his own
rank. The conver&s;ation of gentlemen, and
what they call keeping good company, may be
u&s;ed as a diver&s;ion, or as an excur&s;ion, but his
&s;tated &s;ociety mu&s;t be with his neighbours, and
people in trade; men of bu&s;ine&s;s are compa|nions
for men of bu&s;ine&s;s; with gentlemen he
may conver&s;e plea&s;antly, but here he conver&s;es
profitably; trade&s;men are always profitable to
one another; as they always gain by trading
together, &s;o they never lo&s;e by conver&s;ing to|gether;
if they do not get money, they gain
knowledge in bu&s;ine&s;s, improve their experi|ence,
and &s;ee farther and farther into the world.</P>
<P>A man of but an ordinary penetration will
improve him&s;elf by conver&s;ing in matters of
trade with men of trade; by the experience of
the old trade&s;men they learn caution and pru|dence,
and by the ra&s;hne&s;s and the mi&s;carriages
of the young, they learn what are the mi&s;chiefs
that them&s;elves may be expo&s;ed to.</P>
<P>AGAIN, in conver&s;ing with men of trade,
they get trade; men fir&s;t talk together, then
deal together; many a good bargain is made,
and many a pound gained, where nothing was
expected, by mere ca&s;ual coming to talk toge|ther,
without knowing any thing of the matter
before they met: The trade&s;mens meetings are
like the merchants exchange, where they ma|nage,
negotiate, and indeed beget bu&s;ine&s;s with

<P>LET no trade&s;man mi&s;take me in this part,
I am not encouraging them to leave their &s;hops
and warehou&s;es, to go to taverns and ale-hou&s;es,
<PB N="53" REF="72">
and &s;pend their time there in unnecc&s;&s;ary prat|tle,
which indeed is nothing but &s;otting and
drinking; this is not meeting to do bu&s;ine&s;s;
but to neglect bu&s;ine&s;s. Of which I &s;hall &s;peak
fully to you in a letter by it &s;elf.</P>
<P>BUT the trade&s;men conver&s;ing with one an|other
which I mean, is the taking &s;uitable oc|ca&s;ions
to di&s;cour&s;e with their fellow trade&s;men,
meeting them in the way of their bu&s;ine&s;s, and
improving their &s;pare hours together; to leave
their &s;hops, and quit their counters in the pro|per
&s;ea&s;ons for their attendance there, would
be a prepo&s;terous negligence, would be going
out of bu&s;ine&s;s to gain bu&s;ine&s;s, and would be
cheating them&s;elves in&s;tead of improving them|&s;elves;
the proper hours of bu&s;ine&s;s are &s;acred
to the &s;hop and the warehou&s;e; he that goes
out of the order of trade, let the pretence of
bu&s;ine&s;s be what it will, lo&s;es his bu&s;ine&s;s, not
encrea&s;es it; and will, if continued, lo&s;e the
credit of his conduct in bu&s;ine&s;s al&s;o.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of Diligence and Application in Bu&s;ine&s;s.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_SOLOMON was certainly a friend to men
of bu&s;ine&s;s, as it appears by his frequent
good advice to them, <HI>Prov.</HI> xviii. 9. he
&s;ays, <HI>He that is &s;lothful in bu&s;ine&s;s, is brother
<PB N="56" REF="73">
to him that is a great wa&s;ter:</HI> and in another
place, <HI>The &s;luggard &s;hall be clothed in rags,</HI>
Prov. xxiii. 1. or to that purpo&s;e. On the con|trary,
the &s;ame wi&s;e man, by way of encou|ragement,
tells them, <HI>The diligent hand maketh
rich,</HI> Prov. x. 4. and, <HI>The diligent &s;hall bear
rule, but the &s;lothful &s;hall be under tribute.</HI></P>
<P>NOTHING can give a greater pro&s;pect of
thriving to a young trade&s;man, than his own
diligence; it fills him&s;elf with hope, and gives
him credit to all that know him; without ap|plication
nothing in this world goes forward as
it &s;hould do: let the man have the mo&s;t per|fect
knowledge of his trade, and the be&s;t &s;itua|tion
for his &s;hop, yet without application no|thing
will go on. What is the &s;hop without
the ma&s;ter? what the books without the book-keeper,
the ca&s;h without the ca&s;h-keeper, what
the credit without the man? Hark how the
people talk of &s;uch conduct as the &s;lothful neg|ligent
trader di&s;covers in his way.</P>
<P>&startq;Such a &s;hop, &s;ays the cu&s;tomer, &s;tands well,
and there is a good &s;tock of goods in it,
but there's no body to &s;erve, but a prentice|boy
or two, and an idle journeyman; one
finds them always at play together rather than
looking out for cu&s;tomers; and when you
come to buy, they look as if they did not
care whether they &s;hew'd you any thing or
no. One never &s;ees a ma&s;ter in the &s;hop if
we go twenty times, nor any thing that bears
the face of authority. Then 'tis a &s;hop al|ways
expos'd, 'tis perfectly haunted with thieves
and &s;hop-lifters; they &s;ee no body but raw
<PB N="57" REF="74">
boys in it, that mind nothing, and the diligent
devils never fail to haunt them; &s;o that there's
more out-cries of <HI>&s;top thief</HI> at their door,
and more con&s;tables fetch'd to that &s;hop, than
to all the &s;hops in the row. There was a
brave trade at that &s;hop in Mr.&mdash;'s time;
he was a true &s;hopkeeper; like the quack doctor,
you never mi&s;t him from &s;even in the morn|ing
to twelve, and from two till nine at
night; and he throve accordingly, he left a
good e&s;tate behind him; but I don't know
what the&s;e people are, they &s;ay there are two
partners of them, but there had as good be
none, for they are never at home, nor in
their &s;hop; one wears a long wig and a &s;word,
I hear, and you &s;ee him often in the <HI>Mall</HI>
and at court, but very &s;eldom in his &s;hop, or
waiting on his cu&s;tomers; and the other,
they &s;ay, lies a bed till eleven a clock every
day, ju&s;t comes into the &s;hop and &s;hews him|&s;elf,
then &s;talks about to the tavern to take a
whet, then to <HI>Child</HI>'s coffee-hou&s;e to hear
the news, comes home to dinner at onc,
takes a long &s;leep in his chair after it, and
about four a clock comes into the &s;hop for
half an hour, or thereabouts, then to the ta|vern,
where he &s;tays till two in the morning,
gets drunk, and is led home by the watch,
and &s;o lies till eleven again; and thus he
walks round like the hand of a dial; and
what will it all come to? they'll certainly
break, that you may be &s;ure of, they can't
hold it long.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="75">
THIS is the town's way of talking, where
they &s;ee an example of it in the manner as is
de&s;crib'd; nor are the inferences unju&s;t, any
more than the de&s;cription is unlike, for &s;uch
certainly is the end of &s;uch management, and
no &s;hop thus neglected ever made a trade&s;man
rich.</P>
<P>ON the contrary, cu&s;tomers love to &s;ee the
ma&s;ter's face in the &s;hop, and to go to a &s;hop
where they are &s;ure to find him at home
when he don't &s;ell, or cannot take the price
offer'd, yet the cu&s;tomers are not di&s;oblig'd,
and if they do not deal now, they may another
time; if they do deal, the ma&s;ter generally gets
a better price for his goods than a &s;ervant can,
be&s;ides that he gives better content; and yet
the cu&s;tomers always think they buy cheaper of
the ma&s;ter too.</P>
<P>I &s;eem to be talking now of the mercer or
draper, as if my di&s;cour&s;e was wholly bent and
directed to them; but it is quite contrary, for
it concerns every trade&s;man, the advice is ge|neral,
and every trade&s;man claims a &s;hare in it;
the nature of trade requires it. 'Tis an old an|glici&s;m,
<HI>&s;uch a man drives a trade;</HI> the allu&s;ion
is to a carter, that with his voice, his hands,
his whip, and his con&s;tant attendance, keeps the
team always going, helps him&s;elf, lifts at the
wheel in every &s;lough, doubles his application
upon every difficulty, and in a word, to com|pleat
the &s;imily, if he is not always with his
hor&s;es, either the waggon is &s;et in a hole, or
the team &s;tands &s;till, or, which is wor&s;t of all,
the loading is &s;poil'd by the waggon overthrow|ing</P>
<P><PB N="57" REF="76">
'Tis therefore no improper &s;peech to &s;ay,
&s;uch a man <HI>drives</HI> his trade; for in &s;hort, if
trade is not driven, it will not go.</P>
<P>TRADE is like a hand-mill, it mu&s;t always be
turned about by the diligent hand of the ma&s;|ter;
or if you will, like the pump-hou&s;e at <HI>Am|&s;terdam,</HI>
where they put offenders in for petty
matters, e&s;pecially beggars; if they will work and
keep pumping, they &s;it well, and dry and &s;afe,
and if they work very hard one hour or two,
they may re&s;t, perhaps, a quarter of an hour af|terwards;
but if they over&s;leep them&s;elves, or
grow lazy, the water comes in upon them and
wets them, and they have no dry place to &s;tand
in, much le&s;s to &s;it down in; and in &s;hort, if
they continue ob&s;tinately idle, they mu&s;t &s;ink;
&s;o that it is nothing but <HI>pump</HI> or <HI>drown,</HI> and
they may chu&s;e which they like be&s;t.</P>
<P>HE that engages in trade, and does not re|&s;olve
to work at it, is <HI>felo de &s;e;</HI> 'tis downright
murthering him&s;elf; that is to &s;ay, in his trading
capacity, he murthers his credit, he murthers
his &s;tock, and he &s;tarves, <HI>which is as bad as
murthering</HI> his family.</P>
<P>TRADE mu&s;t not be entred into as a thing of
light concern; it is called <HI>bu&s;ine&s;s</HI> very properly,
for it is a bu&s;ine&s;s <HI>for</HI> life, and ought to be fol|low'd
as one of the great bu&s;ine&s;&s;es <HI>of</HI> life; I do
not &s;ay the chief, but one of the great bu&s;ine&s;&s;es
of life it certainly is: trade mu&s;t, I &s;ay, be
work'd at, not play'd with; he that trades in
je&s;t, will certainly break in earne&s;t; and this is
one rea&s;on indeed why &s;o many trade&s;men
come to &s;o ha&s;ty a conclu&s;ion of their affairs.</P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="77">
THERE was another old <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> &s;aying to
this purpo&s;e, which &s;hews how much our old
fathers were &s;en&s;ible of the duty of a &s;hop|keeper:
&s;peaking of the trade&s;man as ju&s;t open|ing
his &s;hop, and beginning a dialogue with it;
the re&s;ult of which is, that the &s;hop replies to
the trade&s;man thus, <HI>Keep me, and I will keep
thee.</HI> 'Tis the &s;ame with driving the trade; if
the &s;hopkeeper will not keep, that is, diligently
attend his &s;hop, the &s;hop will not keep, that is,
maintain him: and in the other &s;en&s;e 'tis har&s;her
to him, if he will not drive his trade, the trade
will drive him; that is, drive him out of the
&s;hop, drive him away.</P>
<P>ALL the&s;e old &s;ayings have this monitory
&s;ub&s;tance in them; namely, they all concur to
fill a young trade&s;man with true notions of
what he is going about; and that the under|taking
of a trade is not a &s;port or game, in
which he is to meet with diver&s;ions only, and
entertainment, and not to be in the lea&s;t troubled
or di&s;turb'd: trade is a daily employment, and
mu&s;t be follow'd as &s;uch, with the full atten|tion
of the mind, and full attendance of the
per&s;on; nothing but what are to be called the
nece&s;&s;ary duties of life, are to intervene; and
even tho&s;e are to be limited &s;o, as not to be
prejudicial to bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>AND now I am &s;peaking of the nece&s;&s;ary
things which may intervene, and which may
divide the time with our bu&s;ine&s;s or trade, I
&s;hall &s;tate the manner in a few words, that the
trade&s;man may neither give too much, or take
away too much, to or from any re&s;pective part
<PB N="61" REF="78">
of what may be call'd his proper employment,
but keep as due a balance of his time, as he &s;hould
of his books, or ca&s;h.</P>
<P>THE life of man is or &s;hould be a mea&s;ure
of allotted time; as his time is mea&s;ured out to
him, &s;o the mea&s;ure is limited, mu&s;t end, and
the end of it is appointed.</P>
<P>THE purpo&s;es, for which time is given, and
life be&s;tow'd, are very momentous; no time is
given u&s;ele&s;s, and for nothing; time is no more
to be unemploy'd, than it is to be ill employ'd.
Three things are chiefly before us in the appoint|ment
of our time; 1. Nece&s;&s;aries of nature. 2.
Duties of religion, or things relating to a future
life. 3. Duties of the pre&s;ent life, <HI>viz.</HI> bu&s;ine&s;s
and calling.</P>
<P>I. NECESSITIES of nature, &s;uch as eating and
drinking; re&s;t, or &s;leep; and in ca&s;e of di&s;ea&s;e,
a rece&s;s from bu&s;ine&s;s; all which have two limita|tions
on them, and no more; namely, that they be
<Q><LIST>
<ITEM>1. Referr'd to their proper &s;ea&s;ons:</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Us'd with moderation.</ITEM>
</LIST></Q></P>
<P>BOTH the&s;e might give me &s;ubject to write
many letters upon, but I &s;tudy brevity, and de|&s;ire
rather to hint than dwell upon things which
are &s;erious and grave, becau&s;e I would not tire
you.</P>
<P>II. DUTIES of religion: the&s;e may be call'd
nece&s;&s;ities too in their kind, and that of the &s;ub|lime&s;t
nature; and they ought not to be thru&s;t
at all out of their place, and yet they ought to
be kept in their place too,</P>
<P><PB N="64" REF="79">
III. DUTIES of life, that is to &s;ay, bu&s;ine&s;s,
or employment, or calling, which are divided
into three kinds;
<Q><LIST>
<ITEM>1. Labour, or &s;ervitude.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Employment.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. Trade.</ITEM>
</LIST></Q></P>
<P>BY labour, I mean the poor manuali&s;t, whom
we properly call the labouring man, who works
for him&s;elf indeed in one re&s;pect, but &s;ome|times
&s;erves and works for wages, as a &s;ervant,
or workman.</P>
<P>BY employment I mean men in bu&s;ine&s;s,
which yet is not properly call'd trade, &s;uch as
lawyers, phy&s;icians, &s;urgeons, &s;eriveners, clerks,
&s;ecretaries, and &s;uch like: and</P>
<P>BY trade I mean merchants and inland-traders,
&s;uch as are already de&s;crib'd in the introduction
to this work.</P>
<P>TO &s;peak of time, it is divided among the&s;e;
even in them all there is a ju&s;t equality of
circum&s;tances to be pre&s;erv'd, and as diligence is
requir'd in one, and nece&s;&s;ity to be obeyed in
another, &s;o duty is to be ob&s;erved in the third;
and yet all the&s;e with &s;uch a due regard to one
another, as that one duty may not jo&s;tle out
another; and every thing going on with an e|quality
and ju&s;t regard to the nature of the thing,
the trade&s;man may go on with a glad heart, and
a quiet con&s;cience.</P>
<P>THIS article is very nice, as I intend to &s;peak
to it; and 'tis a dangerous thing indeed to &s;peak
to, le&s;t young trade&s;men, treading on the
<PB N="61" REF="80">
brink of duty on one &s;ide, and duty on the
other &s;ide, &s;hould pretend to neglect their duty
to heaven, on pretence that I &s;ay they mu&s;t
not neglect their &s;hops: But let them do me
ju&s;tice, and they will do them&s;elves no injury;
nor do I fear that my arguing on this point
&s;hould give them any ju&s;t cau&s;e to go wrong; if
they will go wrong, and plead my argument for
their excu&s;e, it mu&s;t be by their abu&s;ing my di|rections,
and taking them in pieces, mi&s;placing
the words, and disjointing the &s;en&s;e, and by
the &s;ame method they may make bla&s;phemy of
the &s;cripture.</P>
<P>THE duties of life, I &s;ay, mu&s;t not interfere
with one another, mu&s;t not jo&s;tle one another
out of the place, or &s;o break in as to be preju|dicial
to one another. It is certainly the duty
of every chri&s;tian to wor&s;hip God, to pay his
homage morning and evening to his Maker, and
at all other proper &s;ea&s;ons to behave as becomes
a &s;incere wor&s;hiper of God; nor mu&s;t any avo|cation,
either of bu&s;ine&s;s or nature, however
nece&s;&s;ary, interfere with this duty, either in pub|lick
or in private. This is plainly a&s;&s;erting the
nece&s;&s;ity of the duty, &s;o no man can pretend to
evade that.</P>
<P>BUT the duties of nature and religion al&s;o
have &s;uch particular &s;ea&s;ons, and tho&s;e &s;ea&s;ons
&s;o proper to them&s;elves, and &s;o &s;tated, as not
to break in or intrench upon one another, that
we are really without excu&s;e, if we let any one
be pleaded for the neglect of the other. Food,
&s;leep, re&s;t, and the nece&s;&s;ities of nature, are ei|ther
re&s;erved for the night, which is appointed
<PB N="64" REF="81">
for man to re&s;t, or take up &s;o little room in the
day, that they can never be pleaded in bar of
either religion, or employment.</P>
<P>HE indeed, who will &s;leep when he &s;hould
work, and perhaps drink when he &s;hould &s;leep,
turns nature bottom upwards, inverts the ap|pointment
of providence, and mu&s;t account to
him&s;elf, and afterwards to a higher judge for
the neglect.</P>
<P>THE devil, if it be the devil that tempts, for
I would not wrong Satan him&s;elf, plays our du|ties
often one again&s;t another; and to bring us,
if po&s;&s;ible, into confu&s;ion in our conduct, &s;ubtly
throws religion out of its place, to put it in
our way, and to urge us to a breach of what
we ought to do: be&s;ides this &s;ubtle tempter, for
as above I wont charge it all upon the devil,
we have a great hand in it our&s;elves; but let it be
who it will, I &s;ay, this &s;ubtle tempter hurries the
well-meaning trade&s;man, to act in all manner of
irregularity, that he may confound religion and
bu&s;ine&s;s, and in the end may de&s;troy both.</P>
<P>WHEN the trade&s;man well-inclin'd ri&s;es early
in the morning, and is mov'd, as in duty to
his Maker he ought, to pay his morning vows
to him either in his clo&s;et, or at the church,
where he hears the &s;ix o'clock bell ring to call
his neighbours to the &s;ame duty; then the &s;e|cret
hint comes cro&s;s his happy intention, that
he mu&s;t go to &s;uch or &s;uch a place, that he may
be back time enough for &s;uch other bu&s;ine&s;s as
has been appointed over night, and both per|haps
may be both lawful and ncce&s;&s;ary; &s;o his
diligence oppre&s;&s;es his religion, and away he
<PB N="65" REF="82">
runs to do his bu&s;ine&s;s, and neglects his morn|ing
&s;acrifice to his Maker.</P>
<P>ON the other hand, and at another time, be|ing
in his &s;hop or his compting-hou&s;e, or ware|hou&s;e,
a va&s;t throng of bu&s;ine&s;s upon his hands,
and the world in his head, when it is highly
his duty to attend it, and &s;hall be to his preju|dice
to ab&s;ent him&s;elf; then the &s;ame deceiver
pre&s;&s;es him earne&s;tly to go to his clo&s;et, or to
the church to prayers, during which time his
cu&s;tomer goes to another place, the neighbours
mi&s;s him in his &s;hop, his bu&s;ine&s;s is lo&s;t, his re|putation
&s;uffers, and by this <HI>turn'd into a pra|ctice,</HI>
the man may &s;ay his prayers &s;o long and
&s;o un&s;ea&s;onably 'till he is undone, and not a
creditor he has (I may give it him from experi|ence)
will u&s;e him the better, or &s;hew him the
more favour, when a commi&s;&s;ion of bankrupt
comes out again&s;t him.</P>
<P>THUS I knew once a zealous, pious, religious
trade&s;man, who would almo&s;t &s;hut up his &s;hop e|very
day about nine or ten o'clock to call all his
family together to prayers; and yet he was no
presbyterian I a&s;&s;ure you; I &s;ay, he would almo&s;t
&s;hut up his &s;hop, for he would &s;uffer none of his
&s;ervants to be ab&s;ent from his family-wor&s;hip.</P>
<P>THIS man had certainly been right, had he
made all his family get up by &s;ix o'clock in the
morning, and call'd them to prayers before he
had open'd his &s;hop; but in&s;tead of that, he
fir&s;t &s;uffer'd &s;leep to interfere with religion, and
lying a bed to po&s;tpone and jo&s;tle out his pray|ers,
and then to make God almighty amends
upon him&s;elf, wounds his family by making his
<PB N="66" REF="83">
prayers interfere with his trade, and &s;hut his
cu&s;tomers out of his &s;hop; the end of which
was, the poor good man deceiv'd him&s;elf, and
lo&s;t his bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>ANOTHER trade&s;man, whom I knew per&s;o|nally
well, was rais'd in the morning very early,
by the outcries of his wife, to go and fetch
a midwife; It was nece&s;&s;ary in his way to go by
a church, where there was always on that day
of the week a morning-&s;ermon early, for the
&s;upplying the devotion of &s;uch early chri&s;tains
as he; &s;o the hone&s;t man &s;eeing the door o|pen,
&s;teps in, and &s;eeing the mini&s;ter ju&s;t gone up
into the pulpit, &s;its down, joins in the prayers,
hears the &s;ermon, and goes very gravely home
again; in &s;hort, his earne&s;tne&s;s in the wor&s;hip,
and attention to what he had heard, quite put
the errand he was &s;ent about out of his head;
and the poor woman in travail, after having wait|ed
long for the return of her husband with the
midwife, was obliged, (having run an extreme
hazard by depending on his expedition,) to di&s;|patch
other me&s;&s;engers, who fetch'd the midwife,
and &s;he was come and the work over, long be|fore
the &s;ermon was done, or that any body
heard of the husband: at la&s;t he was met coming
gravely home from the church, when being up|braided
with his negligence, in a dreadful &s;ur|pri&s;e
he &s;truck his hands together, and cried out,
<HI>How is my wife! I profe&s;s I forgot it.</HI></P>
<P>WHAT &s;hall we &s;ay now to this ill-tim'd devo|tion,
and who mu&s;t tempt the poor man to this
neglect? certainly had he gone for the midwife,
it had been much more his duty, than to go to
hear a &s;ermon at that time.</P>
<P><PB N="67" REF="84">
I knew al&s;o another trade&s;man, who was &s;uch
a &s;ermon-hunter, and, as there are lectures and
&s;ermons preach'd in <HI>London,</HI> either in the church|es,
or meeting-hou&s;es, almo&s;t every day in the
week, us'd &s;o affiduou&s;ly to hunt out the&s;e oc|ca&s;ions,
that whether it was in a church or
meeting-hou&s;e, or both, he was always abroad
to hear a &s;ermon, at lea&s;t once every day, and
&s;ometimes more; and the con&s;equence was, that
the man lo&s;t his trade, his &s;hop was entire|ly
neglected, the time which was proper for
him to apply to his bu&s;ine&s;s was mi&s;apply'd, his
trade fell off, and the man broke.</P>
<P>NOW it is true, and I ought to take notice
of it al&s;o, that tho' the&s;e things happen, and may
wrong a trade&s;man, yet 'tis oftner ten times for
once, that trade&s;men neglect their &s;hop and bu|&s;ine&s;s
to follow the track of their vices and ex|travagance;
&s;ome by taverns, others to the
gaming-hou&s;es; others to balls and ma&s;querades,
plays, harlequins, and opera's; very few by too
much religion.</P>
<P>BUT my inference is &s;till &s;ound, and the more
effectually &s;o as to that part; for if our bu&s;ine&s;s
and trades are not to be neglected, no not for
the extraordinary excur&s;ions of religion and re|ligious
duties, much le&s;s are they to be neglected
for vices and extravagances.</P>
<P>THIS is an age of gallantry and gaiety, and
never was the city tran&s;pos'd to the court as it
is now: the play-hou&s;es and balls are now fil|led
with citizens and young trade&s;men, in&s;tead
of gentlemen and families of di&s;tinction; the
&s;hop-keepers were a differing garb now and are
<PB N="68" REF="85">
&s;een with their long wigs and &s;words, rather
than with aprons on, as was formely the figure
they made.</P>
<P>BUT what is the difference in the con&s;equen|ces?
you did not &s;ee in tho&s;e days acts of grace
for the relief of in&s;olvent debtors almo&s;t every
&s;e&s;&s;ions of parliament, and yet the jails fill'd with
in&s;olvents before the next year, though ten or
twelve thou&s;and have been releas'd at a time by
tho&s;e acts.</P>
<P>NOR did you hear of &s;o many commi&s;&s;ions
of bankrupt every week in the gazette, as is now
the ca&s;e; in a word, whether you take the low|er
&s;ort of trade&s;men, or the higher, where there
was twenty that fail'd in tho&s;e days, I believe I
&s;peak within compa&s;s, if I &s;ay that five hundred
turn in&s;olvent now; it is, as I &s;aid above, an
age of plea&s;ure, and as the wi&s;e man &s;aid long
ago, <HI>he that loves plea&s;ure &s;hall be a poor man.</HI>
So it is now: 'tis an age of drunkenne&s;s and ex|travagance,
and thou&s;ands ruin them&s;elves by
that; 'tis an age of luxurious and expen&s;ive liv|ing,
and thou&s;ands more undo them&s;elves by
that; but among all our vices nothing ruins a
trade&s;man &s;o effectually, as the neglect of his
bu&s;ine&s;s: it is true, all tho&s;e things prompt men
to neglect their bu&s;ine&s;s, but the more &s;ea&s;on|able
is the advice; either enter upon no trade,
undertake no bu&s;ine&s;s, or having undertaken it,
per&s;ue it diligently; DRIVE your trade, that the
world may not drive you out of trade, and ru|in
and undo you.</P>
<P>WITHOUT diligence a man can never through|ly
under&s;tand his bu&s;ine&s;s; and how &s;hould a
<PB N="69" REF="86">
man thrive, when he does not perfectly know
what he is doing, or how to do it? application
to his trade teaches him how to carry it on, as
much as his going apprentice taught him how
to &s;et it up. Certainly that man &s;hall never im|prove
in his trading knowledge, that does not
know his bu&s;ine&s;s, or how to carry it on: the
diligent trade&s;man is always the knowing and
complete trade&s;man.</P>
<P>NOW in order to have a man apply heartily,
and per&s;ue earne&s;tly the bu&s;ine&s;s he is engag'd in,
there is yet another thing nece&s;&s;ary, namely, that
he &s;hould delight in it: to follow a trade, and
not to love and delight in it, is a &s;lavery, a bon|dage,
not a bu&s;ine&s;s: the &s;hop is a <HI>Bridewell,</HI>
and the warehou&s;e a hou&s;e of correction to the
trade&s;man, if he does not delight in his trade;
while he is bound, as we &s;ay, to keep his &s;hop,
he is like the galley-&s;lave chain'd down to the
oar; he tuggs and labours indeed, and exerts
the utmo&s;t of his &s;trength for fear of the &s;trap|pado,
and becau&s;e he is obliged to do it; but when
he is on &s;hore, and is out from the bank, he ab|hors
the labour, and hates to come to it again.</P>
<P>TO delight in bu&s;ine&s;s is making bu&s;ine&s;s
plea&s;ant and agreeable; and &s;uch a trade&s;man
cannot but be diligent in it, which according to
<HI>Solomon</HI> makes him certainly rich, and in time
rai&s;es him above the world, and able to in&s;truct
and encourage tho&s;e who come after him.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER VI.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of Over-trading.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_IT is an ob&s;ervation indeed of my own,
but I believe it will hold true almo&s;t in
all the chief trading towns in <HI>England,</HI>
That there are more trade&s;men undone by hav|ing
too much trade, than for want of trade.
Over-trading is among trade&s;men as over-lifting
is among &s;trong men; &s;uch people vain of
their &s;trength, and their pride prompting them
to put it to the utmo&s;t trial, at la&s;t lift at
&s;omething too heavy for them, over-&s;train their
&s;inews, break &s;ome of nature's bands, and are
cripples ever after.</P>
<P>I take over-trading to be to a &s;hop-keeper, as
ambition is to a prince. The late king of <HI>France,</HI>
the great king <HI>Lewis,</HI> ambition led him to in|vade
the dominions of his neighbours; and
while upon the Empire here, or the States Ge|neral
there, or the <HI>Spani&s;h Netherlands</HI> on an|other
quarter, he was an over-match for every
one, and in their &s;ingle capacity he gain'd from
them all: but at la&s;t pride made him think him|&s;elf
a match for them all together, and he enter'd
into a declar'd war again&s;t the Emperor and the
Empire, the kings of <HI>Spain</HI> and <HI>Great-Britain,</HI>
<PB N="71" REF="88">
and the States of <HI>Holland</HI> all at once: and what
was the con&s;equence? they reduc'd him to the
utmo&s;t di&s;tre&s;s, he lo&s;t all his conque&s;ts, was
oblig'd by a di&s;honourable peace to quit what
he had got by encroachment, to demoli&s;h his
invincible towns, &s;uch as <HI>Pignerol, Dunkirk, &amp;c.</HI>
the two &s;tronge&s;t fortre&s;&s;es in <HI>Europe;</HI> and in a
word, like a bankrupt monarch, he may in ma|ny
ca&s;es be &s;aid to have died a beggar.</P>
<P>THUS the &s;trong man in the fable, who by
main &s;trength us'd to rive a tree, undertook one
at la&s;t which was too &s;trong for him, and it clos'd
upon his fingers and held him till the wild
bea&s;ts came and devour'd him. Tho' the &s;tory
is a fable, the moral is good to my pre&s;ent pur|po&s;e,
and is not at all above my &s;ubject; I
mean, that of a trade&s;man, who &s;hould be
warn'd again&s;t over-trading, as earne&s;tly, and
with as much pa&s;&s;ion, as I would warn a dealer
in gunpowder to be wary of fire, or a di&s;tiller
or rectifier of &s;pirits to moderate his furnace, le&s;t
the heads of his &s;tills fly off, and he &s;hould be
&s;calded to death.</P>
<P>FOR a young trade&s;man to over-trade him|&s;elf,
is like a young &s;wimmer going out of his
depth; when if help does not come immediate|ly,
'tis a thou&s;and to one but he &s;inks, and is
drown'd.</P>
<P>ALL ra&s;h adventures are condemn'd by the
prudent part of mankind; but 'tis as hard to re|&s;train
youth in trade, as 'tis in any other thing,
where the advantage &s;tands in view, and the
danger out of &s;ight: the profits of trade are
baits to the avaritious &s;hop-keeper, and he is
<PB N="72" REF="89">
forward to reckon them up to him&s;elf; but
does not perhaps ca&s;t up the difficulty which there
may be to compa&s;s it, or the unhappy con&s;e|quences
of a mi&s;carriage.</P>
<P>FOR want of this con&s;ideration, the trade&s;|man
oftentimes drowns, as I may call it, even
within his depth; that is, he &s;inks when he has
really the &s;ub&s;tance at bottom to keep him up;
and this is all owing to an adventurous bold
&s;pirit in trade, join'd with too great a gu&s;t of
gain. Avarice is the ruin of many people be|&s;ides
trade&s;men; and I might give the late South-&s;ea
calamity for an example, in which the longe&s;t
heads were mo&s;t over-reach'd, not &s;o much by the
wit or cunning of tho&s;e they had to deal with,
as by the &s;ecret promptings of their own avarice;
wherein they abundantly verified an old prover|bial
&s;peech or &s;aying, (<HI>viz.</HI>) <HI>All covet all lo&s;e;</HI>
&s;o it was there indeed, and the cunninge&s;t, wi&s;e&s;t,
&s;harpe&s;t men lo&s;t the mo&s;t money.</P>
<P>THERE are two things which may be proper|ly
call'd <HI>over-trading,</HI> in a young beginner;
and by both which trade&s;men are often over|thrown.</P>
<Q><LIST>
<ITEM>1. TRADING beyond their &s;tock.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. GIVING too large credit.</ITEM>
</LIST></Q>
<P>A trade&s;man ought to con&s;ider and mea&s;ure
well the extent of his own &s;trength; his &s;tock
of money and credit is properly his beginning;
for credit is a &s;tock as well as money: he that
takes too much credit is really in as much dan|ger,
as he that gives too much credit; and the
danger lies particularly in this, if the trade&s;man
over-buys him&s;elf, that is, buys fa&s;ter than he
<PB N="73" REF="90">
can &s;ell, buying upon credit, the payments per|haps
come due too &s;oon for him; the goods
not being &s;old, he mu&s;t an&s;wer the bills upon
the &s;trength of his proper &s;tock; that is, pay
for them out of his own ca&s;h: if that &s;hould
not hold out, he is oblig'd to put off his bills
after they are due, or &s;uffer the impertinence
of being dunn'd by the creditor, <HI>and perhaps by
&s;ervants and apprentices,</HI> and that with the u&s;ual
indecencies of &s;uch kind of people.</P>
<P>THIS impairs his credit, and if he comes to
deal with the &s;ame merchant, or clothier, or o|ther
trade&s;man again, he is treated like one that
is but an indifferent payma&s;ter; and tho' they may
give him credit as before, yet depending that if
he bargains for &s;ix months, he will take eight
or nine in the payment, they con&s;ider it in the
price, and u&s;e him accordingly; and this im|pairs
his gain: &s;o that lo&s;s of credit is indeed
lo&s;s of money, and this weakens him both ways.</P>
<P>A trade&s;man therefore, e&s;pecially at his be|ginning,
ought to be very wary of taking too
much credit; he had much better &s;lip the occa|&s;ion
of buying now and then a bargain to his
advantage, (for that is u&s;ually the temptation,)
than buying a greater quantity of goods than he
can pay for, run into debt, and be in&s;ulted, and
at la&s;t ruin'd. Merchants and whole&s;ale deal|ers,
<HI>to put off their goods,</HI> are very apt to
prompt young &s;hopkeepers and young trade&s;men
to buy great quantities of goods, and take large
credit at fir&s;t: but 'tis a &s;nare that many a young
beginner has fallen into, and been ruin'd in the
very bud; for if the young beginner does not
<PB N="74" REF="91">
find a vent for the quantity, he is undone,
for at the time of payment the merchant ex|pects
his money, whether the goods are &s;old or
not; and if he cannot pay he is gone at once.</P>
<P>THE trade&s;man that buys warily, always pays
&s;urely, and every young beginner ought to buy
cautiou&s;ly: if he has money to pay, he need
never fear goods to be had; the merchants
warehou&s;es are always open, and they may &s;up|ply
them&s;elves upon all occa&s;ions, as they want,
and as their cu&s;tomers call.</P>
<P>IT may pa&s;s for a kind of an objection here,
that there are &s;ome goods which a trade&s;man
may deal in, which are to be bought at &s;uch
and &s;uch markets only, and at &s;uch and &s;uch
fairs only, that is to &s;ay, are chiefly bought
there; as the chee&s;emongers buy their &s;tocks of
chee&s;e and of butter, the chee&s;e at &s;everal fairs
in <HI>Warwick&s;hire,</HI> as at <HI>Ather&s;ton</HI> fair in parti|cular,
or at&mdash;fair in <HI>Glouce&s;ter&s;hire,</HI>
and at <HI>Sturbridge</HI> fair near <HI>Cambridge;</HI> and their
butter at <HI>Ip&s;wich</HI> fair in <HI>Suffolk;</HI> and &s;o of
many other things; but the an&s;wer is plain,
tho&s;e things which are generally bought thus,
are ready money goods, and the trade&s;man has a
&s;ure rule for buying, namely, his ca&s;h: but as
I am &s;peaking of taking credit, &s;o I mu&s;t be
nece&s;&s;arily &s;uppos'd to &s;peak of &s;uch goods as are
bought upon credit, as the linen-draper buys of
the <HI>Hambro'</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI> merchants; the woollen|draper
of the <HI>Blackwell-hall</HI> men; the haber|da&s;$er
of the thread merchants; the mercer
of the weavers and <HI>Italian</HI> merchants; the &s;ilk|man
of the <HI>Turkey</HI> merchants; and the like:
<PB N="75" REF="92">
here they are under no nece&s;&s;ity of running
deep into debt, but may buy &s;paringly, and re|cruit
again as they &s;ell off.</P>
<P>I know &s;ome trade&s;men are very fond of
&s;eeing their &s;hops well &s;tockt, and their ware|hou&s;es
full of goods, and this is a &s;nare to
them, and brings them to buy in more goods
than they want; but this is a great error, either
in their judgment or their vanity; for except in
retailers &s;hops, and that in &s;ome trades where
they mu&s;t have a great choice of goods or el&s;e
may want a trade; otherwi&s;e a well-experienc'd
trade&s;man had rather &s;ee his warehou&s;e too
empty than too full: if it be too empty, he
can fill it when he plea&s;es, if his credit be
good, or his ca&s;h &s;trong; but a throng'd ware|hou&s;e
is a &s;ign of the want of cu&s;tomers, and of
a bad market; whereas an empty warehou&s;e is a
&s;ign of a nimble demand.</P>
<P>LET no young trade&s;man value him&s;elf upon
having a very great throng of goods in hand;
having ju&s;t a nece&s;&s;ary &s;upply to produce a
choice of new and fa&s;hionable goods, nay, tho'
he be a mercer, for they are the mo&s;t under the
nece&s;&s;ity of a large &s;tock of goods; but I &s;ay,
&s;uppo&s;ing even the mercer, to have a tolerable
&s;hew and choice of fa&s;hionable goods, that gives
his &s;hop a reputation, he derives no credit at all
from a throng of old <HI>&s;hop-keepers,</HI> as they call them,
<HI>(viz.)</HI> out-of-fa&s;hion things: but in other trades
'tis much more a needful caution; a few goods,
and a quick &s;ale, is the beauty of a trade&s;man's
warehou&s;e, <HI>or &s;hop either;</HI> and 'tis his wi&s;dom
to keep him&s;elf in that po&s;ture that his pay|ments
<PB N="76" REF="93">
may come in on his front, as fa&s;t as they
go out in his rear; that he may be able to an|&s;wer
the demands of his merchants or dealers,
and, if po&s;&s;ible, let no man come twice for his
money.</P>
<P>THE rea&s;on of this is plain, and leads me
back to where I began; credit is &s;tock, and if
well &s;upported is as good as a &s;tock, and will
be as durable. A trade&s;man who&s;e credit is
good, untoucht, un&s;potted, and who, as above,
has maintain'd it with care, &s;hall in many ca&s;es
buy his goods as cheap at three or four months
time of payment, as another man &s;hall with
ready money; I &s;ay in &s;ome ca&s;es, and in goods
which are ordinarily &s;old for time, as all our
manufactures, <HI>the Bay trade excepted,</HI> generally
are.</P>
<P>HE then that keeps his credit un&s;haken, has
a double &s;tock; I mean, 'tis an addition to his
real &s;tock, and often &s;uperior to it: nay, I have
known &s;everal con&s;iderable trade&s;men in this
city who have traded with great &s;ucce&s;s, and
to a very con&s;iderable degree, and yet have not
had at bottom one &s;hilling real &s;tock; but by
the &s;trength of their reputation, being &s;ober
and diligent, and having with care pre&s;erv'd the
character of hone&s;t men, and the credit of their
bu&s;ine&s;s, by cautious dealing, and punctual pay|ments,
they have gone on till the gain of their
trade has effectually e&s;tabli&s;h'd them, and they
have rais'd e&s;tates out of nothing.</P>
<P>BUT to return to the dark &s;ide, <HI>viz. over-trading;</HI>
the &s;econd danger is the giving too
much credit. He that takes credit may give
<PB N="77" REF="94">
credit, but he mu&s;t be exceeding watchful; for
'tis the mo&s;t dangerous &s;tate of life that a trade&s;|man
can live in, for he is in as much jeopardy
as a &s;eaman upon a lee-&s;hore.</P>
<P>IF the people he tru&s;ts fail, or fail but of a
punctual compliance with him, he can never
&s;upport his own credit, unle&s;s by the caution I
am now giving; that is, to be very &s;ure not to
give &s;o much credit as he takes.</P>
<P>BY the word <HI>&s;o much,</HI> I mu&s;t be under&s;tood
thus, either he mu&s;t fell for &s;horter time than
he takes, or in le&s;s quantity; the la&s;t is the
&s;afe&s;t, namely, that he &s;hould be &s;ure not to
tru&s;t out &s;o much as he is tru&s;ted with. If he
has a real &s;tock indeed, be&s;ides the credit he
takes, that indeed makes the ca&s;e differ; and
a man that can pay his own debts, whether
other people pay him or no, that man is out of
the que&s;tion; he is pa&s;t danger, and cannot be
hurt: But if he tru&s;ts beyond the extent of his
&s;tock and credit, even HE may be overthrown
too.</P>
<P>THERE were many &s;ad examples of this in the
time of the late war, and in the days when the
publick credit was in a more precarious condition
than it has been &s;ince; I &s;ay, &s;ad examples, <HI>viz.</HI>
when trade&s;men in flour&s;hing circum&s;tances, and
who had indeed good e&s;tates at bottom, and were
in full credit them&s;elves, tru&s;ted the publick
with too great &s;ums; which not coming in at
the time expected, either by the deficiency of
the funds given by parliament, and the parlia|ment
them&s;elves not &s;oon making good tho&s;e
deficiencies, or by other di&s;a&s;ters of tho&s;e times;
<PB N="78" REF="95">
I &s;ay, their money not coming in to an&s;wer
their demands, they were ruin'd; at lea&s;t, their
credit wounded, and &s;ome quite undone, who
yet, had they been paid, could have paid all
their own debts, and had good &s;ums of money
left.</P>
<P>OTHERS, who had ability to afford it, were
oblig'd to &s;ell their tallies and orders at 40 or 50
<HI>per cent.</HI> lo&s;s; from whence proceeded that
black trade of buying and &s;elling navy and
victualling bills, and tran&s;port debts, by which
the brokers and u&s;urers got e&s;tates, and many
thou&s;ands of trade&s;men were brought to no|thing;
even tho&s;e that &s;tood it, lo&s;t great &s;ums
of money by &s;elling their tallies: but credit
cannot be bought too dear; and the throwing
away one half to &s;ave the other, was much
better than &s;inking under the burthen; like a
&s;ailor in a &s;torm, who to lighten the &s;hip wal|lowing
in the trough of the &s;ea, will throw
the choice&s;t goods over-board, even to half the
cargo, in order to keep the &s;hip above water,
and &s;ave their lives.</P>
<P>THESE were terrible examples of <HI>over-trading</HI>
indeed; the men were tempted by the high
price which the government gave for their
goods, and which they were oblig'd to give, be|cau&s;e
of the badne&s;s of the publick credit at
that time; But this was not &s;ufficient to make
good the lo&s;s &s;u&s;tain'd in the &s;ale of the tallies,
&s;o that even they that &s;old and were able to
&s;tand without ruin, were yet great &s;ufferers, and
had enough to do to keep up their credit.</P>
<P><PB N="79" REF="96">
THIS was the effect of giving over much cre|dit;
for tho' it was the government it&s;elf which
they tru&s;ted, yet neither could the government
it&s;elf keep up the &s;inking credit of tho&s;e whom
it was indebted to; and indeed, how &s;hould it,
when it was not able to &s;upport its own credit?
But that by the way. I return to the young
trade&s;man, whom we are now &s;peaking about.</P>
<P>IT is his greate&s;t prudence therefore, after he
has con&s;ider'd his own fund, and the &s;tock he
has to re&s;t upon; I &s;ay, his next bu&s;ine&s;s is to
take care of his credit, and next to limiting
his buying-liberty, let him be &s;ure to limit his
&s;elling; could the trade&s;man buy all upon cre|dit,
and &s;ell all for ready money, he might
turn u&s;urer, and put his own &s;tock out to in|tere&s;t,
or buy land with it, for he would have
no occa&s;ion for one &s;hilling of it: but &s;ince
that is not expected, nor can be done, it is his
bu&s;ine&s;s to act with prudence in both parts, I
mean, of taking and giving credit; and the be&s;t
rule to be given him for it is, never to give &s;o
much credit as he takes, by at lea&s;t one third
part.</P>
<P>BY giving credit I do not mean, that even all
the goods which he buys upon credit may not
be &s;old upon credit; perhaps they are goods
which are u&s;ually &s;old &s;o, and no otherwi&s;e:
but the alternative is before him thus; either he
mu&s;t not give &s;o much credit in quantity of
goods, or not &s;o long credit in relation to time:
for example,</P>
<P>SUPPOSE the young trade&s;man buys ten thou|&s;and
pounds value of goods on credit, and this
<PB N="80" REF="97">
ten thou&s;and pounds are &s;old for eleven thou&s;and
pounds likewi&s;e on credit; if the time given
be the &s;ame, the man is in a &s;tate of apparent
de&s;truction, and 'tis a hundred to one but he is
blown up; perhaps he owes the ten thou&s;and
pound to twenty men, perhaps the eleven thou|&s;and
pound is owing to him by two hundred
men: it is &s;carce po&s;&s;ible that the&s;e two hun|dred
petty cu&s;tomers of his, &s;hould all &s;o punctu|ally
comply with their payments, as to enable
him to comply with his; and if two or three
thou&s;and pounds fall &s;hort, the poor trade&s;man,
unle&s;s he has a fund to &s;upport the deficiency,
mu&s;t be undone.</P>
<P>BUT if the man had bought ten thou&s;and
pounds at &s;ix or eight months credit, and had
&s;old them all again as above to his two hundred
cu&s;tomers, at three months and four months
credit, then it might be &s;uppo&s;ed all, or the
greate&s;t part of them, would have paid time e|nough
to make his payments good; if not, all
would be lo&s;t &s;till.</P>
<P>BUT on the other hand, &s;uppo&s;e he had &s;old
but three thou&s;and pounds worth of the ten for
ready money, and had &s;old the re&s;t for &s;ix months
credit; it might be &s;uppos'd that the three thou|&s;and
pounds in ca&s;h, and what el&s;e the two
hundred debtors might pay in time, might &s;top
the mouths of the trade&s;man's creditors, 'till the
difference might be made good.</P>
<P>SO ea&s;y a thing is it for a trade&s;man to lo&s;e
his credit in trade, and &s;o hard is it once upon
&s;uch a blow to retrieve it again: what need then
is there for the trade&s;man to guard him&s;elf a|gain&s;t
<PB N="81" REF="98">
running too far into debt, or letting o|ther
people run too far into debt to him; for
if they do not pay him, he cannot pay others,
and the next thing is a commi&s;&s;ion of bank|rupt,
and &s;o the trade&s;man may be undone,
tho' he has eleven thou&s;and pound to pay ten
with.</P>
<P>IT is true, it is not po&s;&s;ible in a country
where there is &s;uch an infinite extent of trade
as we &s;ee manag'd in this kingdom, that ei|ther
on one hand or another it can be carried
on, without a reciprocal credit both taken and
given; but it is &s;o nice an article, that I am
of opinion, as many trade&s;men break with giving
too much credit, as break with taking it. The
danger indeed is mutual, and very great: what|ever
then the young trade&s;man omits, let him
guard again&s;t both his giving and taking too much
credit.</P>
<P>BUT there are divers ways of over-trading,
be&s;ides this of taking and giving too much credit;
and one of the&s;e is the running out into projects
and heavy undertakings, either out of the com|mon
road which the trade&s;man is already engaged
in, or gra&s;ping at too many undertakings at
once, and having, as it is vulgarly expre&s;s'd, too
many irons in the fire at a time; in both which
ca&s;es the trade&s;man is often wounded, and that
deeply, &s;ometimes too deep to recover.</P>
<P>THE con&s;equences of tho&s;e adventures are
generally &s;uch as the&s;e; fir&s;t, that they &s;tock-&s;tarve
the trade&s;man, and impoveri&s;h him in his
ordinary bu&s;ine&s;s, which is the main &s;upport of
his family; they le&s;&s;en his &s;trength, and while
<PB N="82" REF="99">
his trade is not le&s;&s;en'd, yet his &s;tock is le&s;&s;en'd;
and as they very rarely add to his credit, &s;o if they
le&s;&s;en the man's &s;tock, they weaken him in the
main, and he mu&s;t at la&s;t faint under it.</P>
<P>SECONDLY, as they le&s;&s;en his &s;tock, &s;o they
draw from it in the mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible part; they
wound him in the tendere&s;t and mo&s;t nervous
part; for they always draw away his ready mo|ney:
and what follows? The money, which was
before the &s;inews of his bu&s;ine&s;s, the life of his
trade, maintain'd his &s;hop, and kept up his cre|dit
in the full extent of it, being drawn off, like
the blood let out of the veins, his trade lan|gui&s;hes,
his credit by degrees flags and goes off,
and the trade&s;man falls under the weight.</P>
<P>THUS have I &s;een many a flouri&s;hing trade&s;|man
&s;en&s;ibly decay; his credit has fir&s;t a little
&s;uffer'd, then for want of that credit trade has
declin'd; that is to &s;ay, he has been obliged to
trade for le&s;s and le&s;s, 'till at la&s;t he is wa&s;ted and
reduc'd: if he has been wi&s;e enough and wary e|nough
to draw out betimes, and avoid breaking,
he has yet come out of trade, like an old <HI>inva|lid</HI>
&s;oldier out of the wars, maim'd, bruis'd, &s;ick
reduc'd, and fitter for an ho&s;pital than a &s;hop;
&s;uch mi&s;erable havock has launching out into
projects and remote undertakings made among
trade&s;men.</P>
<P>BUT the &s;afe trade&s;man is he, that avoiding
all &s;uch remote excur&s;ions, keeps clo&s;e within
the verge of his own affairs; minds his &s;hop or
warehou&s;e, and confining him&s;elf to what be|longs
to him there, goes on in the road of his
bu&s;ine&s;s without launching into unknown oce|ans;
<PB N="83" REF="100">
and content with the gain of his own trade,
is neither led by ambition, or avarice; and nei|ther
covets to be greater or richer by &s;uch un|certain
and hazardous attempts.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Trade&s;man in di&s;tre&s;s, and becom|ing
Bankrupt.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_IN former times it was a di&s;mal and cala|mitous
thing for a trade&s;man <HI>to break:</HI>
where it befell a family, it put all into
confu&s;ion and di&s;traction; the man in the utmo&s;t
terror, fright, and di&s;tre&s;s, ran away with what
goods he could get off, as if the hou&s;e was on
fire, to get into the <HI>Fryars,</HI> or the <HI>Mint;</HI> the
family fled <HI>one</HI> one way, and <HI>one</HI> another, like
people in de&s;peration; the wife to her father
and mother, <HI>if &s;he had any,</HI> and the children
&s;ome to one relation, &s;ome to another; a &s;ta|tute
(&s;o they vulgarly call a commi&s;&s;ion of bank|rupt)
came and &s;wept away all, and oftentimes
con&s;um'd it too, and left little or nothing, ei|ther
to pay the creditors, or relieve the bank|rupt.
This made the bankrupt de&s;perate, and
made him fly to tho&s;e places of &s;helter with his
<PB N="84" REF="101">
goods, where, harden'd by the cruelty of the
creditors, he cho&s;e to &s;pend all the effects which
&s;hould have paid the creditors, and at la&s;t peri&s;h'd
in mi&s;ery.</P>
<P>But now the ca&s;e is alter'd: men make &s;o
little of breaking, that many times the family
&s;carce removes for it; a commi&s;&s;ion of bank|rupt
is &s;o familiar a thing, that the debtor often|times
cau&s;es it to be taken out in his favour,
that he may the &s;ooner be effectually deliver'd
from all his creditors at once, the law obliging
him only to give a full account of him&s;elf up|on
oath to the commi&s;&s;ioners, who, when they
&s;ee his integrity, may effectually deliver him
from all farther mole&s;tation, give him a part e|ven
of the creditor's e&s;tate, and &s;o he may pu&s;h
into the world again, and try whether he can|not
retrieve his fortunes by a better management,
or with better &s;ucce&s;s for the future.</P>
<P>SOME have &s;aid, this law is too favourable to
the bankrupt; that it makes trade&s;men care|le&s;s;
that they value not breaking at all, but run
on at all hazards, venturing without foreca&s;t and
without con&s;ideration, knowing they may come
off again &s;o cheap and &s;o ea&s;ie, if they mi&s;car|ry:
but though I cannot enter here into a long
debate upon that &s;ubject, yet I may have room
to &s;ay, that I differ from tho&s;e people very much;
for though the terror of the commi&s;&s;ion is in
&s;ome mea&s;ure abated, as indeed it ought to be,
becau&s;e it was before exorbitant and unrea&s;ona|ble;
yet the terror of ruining a man's family,
&s;inking his fortunes, bla&s;ting his credit, and
throwing him out of bu&s;ine&s;s, and into the wor&s;t
<PB N="85" REF="102">
of di&s;grace that a trade&s;man can fall into, this
is not taken away, or abated at all; and this
to an hone&s;t trading man is as bad as all the
re&s;t ever was or could be.</P>
<P>NOR can a man be &s;uppos'd in the rupture of
his affairs, to receive any comfort, or to &s;ee thro'
his di&s;a&s;ters into the little relief which he may,
and at the &s;ame time cannot be &s;ure he &s;hall,
receive at the end of his troubles, from the
mercy of the commi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>THESE are poor things and very trifling, for
a trade&s;man to entertain thoughts of a breach
from, e&s;pecially with any pro&s;pect of &s;atisfacti|on;
nor can any trade&s;man with the lea&s;t &s;ha|dow;
of principle entertain any thought of break|ing,
but with the utmo&s;t aver&s;ion, and even
abhorrence; for the circum&s;tances of it are at|tended
with &s;o many mortifications, and &s;o ma|ny
&s;hocking things, contrary to all the views
and expectations that a trade&s;man can begin the
world with, that he cannot think of it, but as
we do of the grave, with a chilne&s;s upon the
blood, and a tremor in the &s;pirits. Breaking is
the death of a trade&s;man; he is mortally &s;tabb'd,
or, as we may &s;ay, &s;hot thro' the head in his
trading capacity; his &s;hop is &s;hut up, as it is
when a man is buried; his credit, the life
and blood of his trade, is &s;tagnated; and his at|tendance,
which was the pul&s;e of his bu&s;ine&s;s,
is &s;topt, and beats no more; in a word, his
fame, and even name as to trade, is buried,
and the commi&s;&s;ioners, that act upon him, and all
their proceedings, are but like the executors of the
defunct, dividing the ruins of his fortune, and
<PB N="86" REF="103">
at la&s;t, his certificate is a kind of performing
the ob&s;equies for the dead, and praying him out
of purgatory.</P>
<P>DID ever trade&s;man &s;et up on purpo&s;e to
break? Did ever a man build him&s;elf a hou&s;e
on purpo&s;e to have it burnt down? I can by
no means grant that any trade&s;man, at lea&s;t in
his &s;en&s;es, can entertain the lea&s;t &s;atisfaction in
his trading, or abate any thing of his diligence
in trade, from the ea&s;ine&s;s of breaking, or the
abated &s;everities of the bankrupt act.</P>
<P>I cou'd argue it from the nature of the act it
&s;elf, which indeed was made, and is effectual,
chiefly for the relief of creditors, not debtors;
to &s;ecure the bankrupt's effects for the u&s;e of
tho&s;e to whom it of right belongs, and to pre|vent
the extravagant expences of the commi&s;|&s;ion,
which before was &s;uch as often devour'd
all, ruining both the bankrupt and his creditors
too. This the pre&s;ent law has providently
put a &s;top to, and the creditors now are &s;ecure
in this point, that what is to be had, what the
poor trade&s;man has left, they are &s;ure to have
pre&s;erv'd for, and divided among them, which
indeed before they were not: The ca&s;e is &s;o
well known, and &s;o recent in every trade&s;man's
memory, that I need not take up any more of
your time about it.</P>
<P>AS to the encouragements in the act for the
bankrupt, they are only the&s;e, namely, that
upon his hone&s;t and faithful &s;urrender of his
affairs, he &s;hall be &s;et at liberty; and if they &s;ee
cau&s;e, they, the creditors, may give him back a
&s;mall gratification for his di&s;covering his effects,
<PB N="87" REF="104">
and a&s;&s;i&s;ting to the recovery of them; and all
this, which amounts to very little, is upon his
being, as I have &s;aid, entirely hone&s;t, and hav|ing
run thro' all po&s;&s;ible examinations and pur|gations,
and that it is at the peril of his life if he
prevaricates.</P>
<P>ARE the&s;e encouragements to trade&s;men to
be negligent and carele&s;s of the event of things?
Will any man in his wits fail in his trade,
break his credit, and &s;hut up his &s;hop for the&s;e
pro&s;pects? Or will he comfort him&s;elf in ca&s;e
he is forced to fail, I &s;ay, will he comfort him|&s;elf
with the&s;e little benefits, and make the
matter ea&s;y to him&s;elf on that account? He
mu&s;t have a very mean &s;pirit that can do this,
and mu&s;t act upon very mean principles in life,
who can fall with &s;atisfaction, on purpo&s;e to
ri&s;e no higher than this; 'tis like a man going
to bed on purpo&s;e to ri&s;e naked, plea&s;ing him|&s;elf
with the thoughts that tho' he &s;hall have no
cloaths to put on, yet he &s;hall have the liberty
to get out of bed and &s;hift for him&s;elf.</P>
<P>ON the&s;e accounts, and &s;ome others, too long
to mention here, I think 'tis out of doubt that
the ea&s;ine&s;s of the proceedings on commi&s;&s;ions
of bankrupt, can be no encouragement to any
trade&s;man to break, or &s;o much as to entertain
the thoughts of it, with le&s;s horror and aver|&s;ion
than he would have done before this law
was made.</P>
<P>BUT I mu&s;t come now to &s;peak of the trade&s;|man
in his real &s;tate of mortification, and un|der
the inevitable nece&s;&s;ity of a blow upon his
affairs: He has had lo&s;&s;es in his bu&s;ine&s;s, &s;uch
<PB N="88" REF="105">
as are too heavy for his &s;tock to &s;upport; he
has perhaps launch'd out in trade beyond his
reach; either he has &s;o many bad debts that he
cannot find by his books he has enough left to
pay his creditors; or his debts lie out of his
reach, and he can't get them in, <HI>which in one
re&s;pect is as bad;</HI> he has more bills running a|gain&s;t
him than he knows how to pay; and cre|ditors
dunning him who it is hard for him to
comply with; and this by degrees &s;inks his
credit.</P>
<P>Now could the poor unhappy trade&s;man take
good advice, now would be his time to pre|vent
his utter ruin, and let his ca&s;e be better or
wor&s;e, his way is clear.</P>
<P>IF it be only that he has over-&s;hot him&s;elf in
trade, taken too much credit, and is loaded
with goods; or given too much credit, and can|not
get his debts in; but that upon ca&s;ting up
his books he finds his circum&s;tances good at bot|tom,
tho' his credit has &s;uffer'd by his effects
being out of his hands; let him endeavour to
retrench, let him check his carrier in trade;
immediately take &s;ome extraordinary mea&s;ures
to get in his debts, or &s;ome extraordinary mea|&s;ures,
if he can, to rai&s;e money in the mean
time, till tho&s;e debts come in, that he may &s;top
the crowd of pre&s;ent demands; if this will not
do, let him treat with &s;ome of his principal cre|ditors,
&s;hewing them a true and faithful &s;tate of
his affairs, and giving them the be&s;t a&s;&s;urances
he can of payment, that they may be ea&s;y with
him till he can get in his debts; and then with
the utmo&s;t care draw in his trade within the
<PB N="89" REF="106">
due compa&s;s of his &s;tock, and be &s;ure never to
run out again farther than he is able to an&s;wer,
let the pro&s;pect of advantage be what it will;
and by this method he may perhaps recover his
credit again; at lea&s;t he may prevent his ruin:
But this is always &s;uppo&s;ing the man has a firm
bottom, that he is &s;ound in the main, and that
his &s;tock is at lea&s;t &s;ufficient to pay all his
debts.</P>
<P>BUT the difficulty which I am propo&s;ing to
&s;peak of, is when the poor trade&s;man, di&s;tre&s;s'd
<HI>as above</HI> in point of credit, looking into his
affairs, finds that his &s;tock is dimini&s;hed, or
perhaps entirely &s;unk; that in &s;hort he has
&s;uch lo&s;&s;es, and &s;uch di&s;appointments in his bu|&s;ine&s;s,
that he is not &s;ound at bottom; that he
has run too far, and that his own &s;tock being
wa&s;ted or &s;unk, he has not really &s;ufficient to
pay his debts; what is this man's bu&s;ine&s;s? and
what cour&s;e &s;hall he take?</P>
<P>I know the ordinary cour&s;e with &s;uch trade&s;|men
is this; it is true, &s;ays the poor man, I am
running down, and I have lo&s;t &s;o much in &s;uch
a place, and &s;o much by &s;uch a chapman that
broke, and in &s;hort, &s;o much that I am wor&s;e
than nothing; <HI>but come,</HI> I have &s;uch a thing
before me, or I have undertaken &s;uch a project,
or I have &s;uch an adventure abroad, if it &s;uc|ceeds
I may recover again; I'll try my utmo&s;t
I'll never drown while I can &s;wim; I'll never
fall while I can &s;tand; who knows but I may
get over it? In a word, the poor man is loth to
come to the fatal day; loth to have his name
in the gazette$ and &s;ee his wife and family turn'd
<PB N="90" REF="107">
out of doors, and the like; who can blame
him? or who is not, in the like ca&s;e, apt to
take the like mea&s;ures? for 'tis natural to us all
to put the evil day far from us; at lea&s;t, to put
it as far off as we can: tho' the criminal believes
he &s;hall be executed at la&s;t, yet he accepts of
every reprieve, as it puts him within the po&s;&s;i|bility
of an e&s;cape, and that as long as there is
life there is hopes; but at la&s;t, the dead warrant
comes down, then he &s;ees death unavoidable,
and gives him&s;elf up to de&s;pair.</P>
<P>INDEED the malefactor was in the right to ac|cept,
as I &s;ay, of every reprieve; but it is quite
otherwi&s;e in the trade&s;man's ca&s;e; and if I may
give him a rule, &s;afe, and in its end comfortable,
in proportion to his circum&s;tances, but to be
&s;ure, out of que&s;tion ju&s;t, hone&s;t and prudent, it
is this:</P>
<P>WHEN he perceives his ca&s;e as above, and
knows that if his new adventures or projects
&s;hould fail, he cannot by any means &s;tand or
&s;upport him&s;elf, I not only give it as my advice
to all trade&s;men, as their intere&s;t, but in&s;i&s;t upon
it, as they are hone&s;t men they &s;hould break; that
is, &s;top in time; Fear not to do that which ne|ce&s;&s;ity
obliges you to do; but above all, fear
not to do that early, which if omitted, nece&s;&s;ity
will oblige you to do late.</P>
<P>FIRST, let me argue upon the hone&s;ty of it,
and next upon the prudence of it. Certainly
hone&s;ty obliges every man, when he &s;ees that
his &s;tock is gone, that he is below the level,
and eating into the e&s;tates of other men, to put a
&s;top to it; and to do it in time, while &s;omething
<PB N="91" REF="108">
is left. It has been a fault, without doubt, to
break in upon other mens e&s;tates at all; but per|haps
a plea may be made that it was ignorantly
done, and they did not think they were run &s;o
far, as to be wor&s;e than nothing; or &s;ome &s;ud|den
di&s;a&s;ter may have occa&s;ion'd it, which they
did not expect, and it may be cou'd not fore&s;ee;
both which may indeed happen to a trade&s;man,
tho' <HI>the former</HI> can hardly happen without his
fault, becau&s;e he ought to be always acquaint|ing
him&s;elf with his books, &s;tating his expences
and his profits, and ca&s;ting things up frequently,
at lea&s;t in his head, &s;o as always to know whe|ther
he goes backward or forward. <HI>The latter,</HI>
namely, &s;udden di&s;a&s;ter, may happen &s;o to any
trade&s;man as that he may be undone, and it
may not be his fault; for ruin &s;ometimes falls as
&s;uddenly as unavoidably upon a trade&s;man, tho'
there are but very few incidents of that kind,
which may not be accounted for in &s;uch a man|ner
as to charge it upon his prudence.</P>
<P>SOME ca&s;es may indeed happen, &s;ome di&s;a&s;|ters
may befall a trade&s;man, which it was not
po&s;&s;ible he &s;hould fore&s;ee; as fire, floods of
water, thieves, and many &s;uch; and in tho&s;e
ca&s;es the di&s;a&s;ter is vi&s;ible, the plea is open, eve|ry
body allows it, the man can have no blame.
A prodigious tide from the &s;ea, join'd with a
great fre&s;h or flood in the river <HI>Dee,</HI> de&s;troy'd
the new wharf below the <HI>Roodee</HI> at <HI>We&s;t Che&s;|ter,</HI>
and tore down the merchants warehou&s;es
there, and drove away not only all the goods,
but even the buildings and all together, into
the &s;ea; Now, if a poor &s;hop-keeper in <HI>Che&s;ter</HI>
<PB N="92" REF="109">
had a large parcel of goods lying there, perhaps
newly landed in order to be brought up to the
city, but were all &s;wept away, if, <HI>I &s;ay,</HI> the poor
trade&s;man was ruin'd by the lo&s;s of tho&s;e goods
on that occa&s;ion, the creditors would &s;ee rea&s;on
in it that they &s;hould every one take a &s;hare in
the lo&s;s; the trade&s;man was not to blame.</P>
<P>LIKEWISE in the di&s;tre&s;s of the late fire which
began in <HI>Thames-&s;treet,</HI> near <HI>Bear-key,</HI> a grocer
might have had a quantity of goods in a ware|hou&s;e
thereabouts, or his &s;hop might be there,
and the goods perhaps might be &s;ugars, or cur|rants,
or tobacco, or any other goods in his way,
which cou'd not be ea&s;ily remov'd; this fire
was a &s;urprize, it was a bla&s;t of powder, it was
at noon-day, when no per&s;on cou'd for&s;ee it;
the man may have been undone and be in no
fault him&s;elf, one way or other; no man can
rea&s;onably &s;ay to him, why did you keep &s;o
many goods upon your hands, or in &s;uch a
place? for it was his proper bu&s;ine&s;s both to
have a &s;tock of goods, and to have them in
&s;uch a place; every thing was in the right po|&s;ition,
and in the order which the nature of his
rade requir'd.</P>
<P>ON the other hand, if it was the breaking of
a particular chapman, or an adventure by &s;ea,
the creditors would perhaps reflect on his pru|dence,
why &s;hould any man tru&s;t a &s;ingle chap|man
&s;o much, or adventure &s;o much in one &s;in|gle
bottom, and unin&s;ur'd, as that the lo&s;s of it
would be his undoing?</P>
<P>BUT there are other (however) ca&s;es which may
happen to a trade&s;man; and by which he may be at
<PB N="93" REF="110">
once reduc'd below his proper &s;tock, and have
nothing le&s;t to trade on but his credit, that is to
&s;ay, the e&s;tates of his creditors; In &s;uch a ca&s;e,
I que&s;tion whether it can be hone&s;t for any man
to continue trading; for fir&s;t, it is making his
creditors run an unju&s;t hazard without their con|fent;
indeed, if he di&s;covers his condition to
one or two of them, who are men of capital
&s;tocks, and will &s;upport him, they giving him leave
to pay others off, and go on at their ri&s;ques, that
alters the ca&s;e; or if he has a ready money trade,
that will apparently rai&s;e him again, and he runs
no more hazards, but is &s;ure he &s;hall at lea&s;t
run out no farther; in the&s;e two ca&s;es (and I
do not know another) he may with hone&s;ty
continue.</P>
<P>ON the contrary, when he &s;ees him&s;elf evi|dently
running out, and declining, and has on|ly
a &s;hift here, and a &s;hift there; to lay hold on,
as &s;inking men generally do; and knows, that
unle&s;s &s;omething extraordinary happen, which
perhaps al&s;o is not probable, he mu&s;t fall; for
&s;uch a man to go on, and trade in the ordinary
way, notwith&s;tanding lo&s;&s;es, and hazards, in &s;uch
a ca&s;e I affirm he cannot act the hone&s;t man, he
cannot go on with ju&s;tice to his creditors or his
family; he ought to call his creditors together,
lay his circum&s;tances hone&s;tly before them, and
pay as far as it will go; if his creditors will do
any thing generou&s;ly for him, to enable him to
go on again, well and good, but he cannot ho|ne&s;tly
oblige them to run the ri&s;que of his un|fortunate
progre&s;s, and to venture their e&s;tates
on his bottom, after his bottom is really no|thing
at all but their money.</P>
<P><PB N="94" REF="111">
BUT I pa&s;s from the hone&s;ty to the prudence
of it; from what regards his creditors, to what
regards him&s;elf; and I affirm, nothing can be
more imprudent and impolitick, as it regards
him&s;elf and his family, than to go on after he
&s;ees his circum&s;tances irrecoverable. If he has
any con&s;ideration for him&s;elf, or his future hap|pine&s;s,
he will &s;top in time, and not be afraid
of meeting the mi&s;chief which he &s;ees follows
too fa&s;t for him to e&s;cape: be not &s;o afraid of
breaking, as not to break 'till nece&s;&s;ity forces
you, and that you have nothing left; in a word,
I &s;peak it to every declining trade&s;man, if you
love your&s;elf, your family, or your reputation,
and would ever hope to look the world in the
face again, <HI>break</HI> in time.</P>
<P>BY breaking in time you will fir&s;t obtain the
character of an hone&s;t, tho' unfortunate man;
'tis owing to the contrary cour&s;e, which is in|deed
the ordinary practice of trade&s;men, name|ly,
not to break 'till they run the bottom quite
out, and have little or nothing left to pay; I
&s;ay, 'tis owing to this, that &s;ome people think
all men that break are knaves; the cen&s;ure 'tis
true is unju&s;t; but the cau&s;e is owing to the
indi&s;cretion,
to call it no wor&s;e, of the poor
trade&s;men, who putting the mi&s;chief as far from
them as they can, trade on to the la&s;t ga&s;p; 'till
a throng of creditors coming on them together,
or being arre&s;ted, and not able to get bail,
or by &s;ome &s;uch publick blow to their credit, they
are brought to a &s;top or breach of cour&s;e; like a
man fighting to the la&s;t ga&s;p who is knock'd down,
and laid on the ground, and then his re&s;i&s;tance
<PB N="95" REF="112">
is at an end; for indeed a trade&s;man pu&s;hing on
under irre&s;i&s;tible misfortunes is but fighting with
the world to the la&s;t drop, and with &s;uch une|qual
odds, that like the &s;oldier &s;urrounded with
enemies, he mu&s;t be kill'd; &s;o the debtor mu&s;t
&s;ink, it cannot be prevented.</P>
<P>IT is true al&s;o, the man that thus &s;truggles to the
la&s;t, brings upon him an univer&s;al reproach, and
a cen&s;ure, that is not only unavoidable, but
ju&s;t, which is wor&s;e; but when a man breaks
in time, he may hold up his face to his credit|ors,
and tell them, that he could have gone on
a con&s;iderable while longer, but that he &s;hould
have had le&s;s left to pay them with, and that
he has cho&s;en to &s;top while he may be able to
give them &s;o con&s;iderable a &s;um, as may con|vince
them of his integrity.</P>
<P>WE have a great clamour among us of the
cruelty of creditors; and it is a popular cla|mour,
that goes a great way with &s;ome people;
but let them tell us when ever creditors were
cruel, when the debtor came thus to them with
15 <HI>s.</HI> in the pound in his offer; perhaps when
the debtor has run to the utmo&s;t, and there ap|pears
to be little or nothing left, he has been
us'd roughly, and 'tis enough to provoke a cre|ditor
indeed to be offer'd a &s;hilling or half a
crown in the pound for a large debt, when had
the debtor been hone&s;t, and broke in time, they
might have receiv'd perhaps two thirds of their
debt, and the debtor been in better condition
too.</P>
<P>BREAK then in time, young trade&s;man! if
you &s;ee you are going down, and that the ha|zard
<PB N="96" REF="113">
of going on is doubtful; you will certain|ly
be receiv'd by your creditors with compa&s;&s;i|on,
and with a generous treatment; and whatever
happens, you will be able to begin the world
again with the title of an hone&s;t man; even
the &s;ame creditors will embark with you again,
and be more forward to give you credit than
before.</P>
<P>IT is true, mo&s;t trade&s;men that break merit the
name of knave or di&s;hone&s;t man, but 'tis not &s;o
with all; the rea&s;on of the difference lies chiefly
in the manner of their breaking, <HI>viz.</HI> whether
&s;ooner or later: It is po&s;&s;ible, he may be an hone&s;t
man who <HI>cannot,</HI> but he can never be hone&s;t
that can, and <HI>will not</HI> pay his debts. Now he,
that being able to pay fifteen &s;hillings in the pound,
will &s;truggle on 'till he &s;ees he &s;hall not be able to
pay half a crown in the pound, this man was
able to pay, but would not; and therefore, as
above, cannot be an hone&s;t man.</P>
<P>IN the next place, what &s;hall we &s;ay to the
peace and &s;atisfaction of mind in breaking, which
the trade&s;man will always have when he acts
the hone&s;t part, and breaks betimes; compared
to that guilt and chagrin of the mind, occa&s;i|oned
by a running on, as I &s;aid, to the la&s;t
ga&s;p, when they have little to pay? Then indeed
the trade&s;man can expect no quarter from his cre|ditors,
and will have no quiet in him&s;elf.</P>
<P>I might in&s;tance here the mi&s;erable, anxious,
perplexed life, which the poor trade&s;man lives
under; the di&s;tre&s;&s;es and extremities of his de|clining
&s;tate; how hara&s;s'd and tormented for
money; what &s;hifts he is driven to for &s;upport|ing
<PB N="97" REF="114">
him&s;elf; how many little, mean, and even
wicked things will even the religous trade&s;man
&s;toop to in his di&s;tre&s;s, to deliver him&s;elf, even
&s;uch things, as his very &s;oul would abhor at
another time; and for which he goes perhaps
with a wounded con&s;cience all his life after?</P>
<P>BY giving up early, all this, which is the mo&s;t
dreadful part of all the re&s;t, would be prevent|ed.
I have heard many an hone&s;t unfortunate
man confe&s;s this, and repent, even with tears,
that they had not learn'd to de&s;pair in trade
&s;ome years &s;ooner than they did, by which they
had avoided falling into many foul and fooli&s;h
actions, which they afterwards had been driven
to by the extremity of their affairs.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER VIII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the ordinary Occa&s;ions of the Ruin of Trade&s;men.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_WHEN I have, as in my la&s;t, given
advice to trade&s;men, when they fall
into difficulties, and find they are run
behind-hand, to break in time, be|fore
they run on too far, and thereby prevent
the con&s;equences of a fatal running on to ex|tremity,
'tis but ju&s;t I &s;hould give them &s;ome
<PB N="98" REF="115">
needful directions, to avoid, if po&s;&s;ible, break|ing
at all.</P>
<P>IN order to this, I will briefly enquire what
are the ordinary originals of a trade&s;man's ruin
in bu&s;ine&s;s: to &s;ay 'tis <HI>negligence,</HI> when I have
<HI>already</HI> pre&s;s'd to a clo&s;e application and <HI>dili|gence;</HI>
that 'tis launching into, and gra&s;ping at,
more bu&s;ine&s;s than their &s;tock, or perhaps their
under&s;tandings are able to manage: when I
have <HI>already</HI> &s;poken of the fatal con&s;equences
of over-trading; to &s;ay 'tis tru&s;ting carele&s;ly
people unable to pay, and running too ra&s;hly
into debt: when I have <HI>already &s;poken</HI> of tak|ing
and giving too much credit; this would all
be but &s;aying the &s;ame thing over again; and I
am too full of particulars, in this important
ca&s;e, to have any need of tautologies and repe|titions:
but there are a great many ways by
which trade&s;men precipitate them&s;elves into
ruin, be&s;ides tho&s;e, and &s;ome that need explain|ing
and enlarging upon.</P>
<P>1. SOME, <HI>e&s;pecially retailers,</HI> ruin them&s;elves
by fixing their &s;hops in &s;uch places as are im|proper
for their bu&s;ine&s;s. In mo&s;t towns, but
particularly in the city of <HI>London,</HI> there are
places as it were appropriated to particular trades,
and where the trades which are plac'd there
&s;ucceed very well, but would do very ill any
where el&s;e, or any other trades in the &s;ame
places; as the orange-merchants and wet-&s;alters
about <HI>Billing&s;gate,</HI> and in <HI>Thames-&s;ttreet;</HI> the
co&s;termongers at the <HI>Three Cranes;</HI> the whole|&s;ale
chee&s;emongers in <HI>Thames-&s;treet;</HI> the mer|cers
and drapers in the high &s;treets, &s;uch as
<PB N="99" REF="116">
<HI>Cheap&s;ide, Ludgate-&s;treet, Cornhill, Round-court,</HI>
and <HI>Gracechurch-&s;treet, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>PRAY what would a book&s;eller make of his
bu&s;ine&s;s at <HI>Billing&s;gate,</HI> or a mercer in <HI>Tower|&s;treet,</HI>
or near the <HI>Cu&s;tom-hou&s;e;</HI> or a draper in
<HI>Thames-&s;reet,</HI> or about <HI>Queen-hithe?</HI> Many
trades have their peculiar &s;treets, and proper
places for the &s;ale of their goods, where people
expect to find &s;uch &s;hops; and con&s;equently,
when they want &s;uch goods, they go thither for
them; as the book&s;ellers in <HI>St. Paul</HI>'s church|yard,
about the <HI>Exchange, Temple</HI> and: the
<HI>Strand, &amp;c.</HI> the mercers on both &s;ides <HI>Ludgate,</HI>
in <HI>Round-court,</HI> and <HI>Gracechurch</HI> and <HI>Lombard-&s;treets;</HI>
the &s;hoemakers in <HI>St. Martins le grand,</HI>
and <HI>Shoemaker-row;</HI> the coachmakers in <HI>Long|acre,
Queen-&s;treet,</HI> and <HI>Bi&s;hop&s;gate;</HI> butchers in
<HI>Ea&s;tcheap,</HI> and &s;uch like.</P>
<P>FOR a trade&s;man to open his &s;hop in a place
unre&s;orted-to, or in a place where his trade is
not agreeable, and where 'tis not expected, 'tis
no wonder if he has no trade. What retale
trade would a milliner have among the fi&s;h|mongers
&s;hops on <HI>Fi&s;h&s;treet-hill;</HI> or a toy-man
about <HI>Queen-hithe?</HI> When a &s;hop is ill cho&s;en,
the trade&s;man &s;tarves, he is out of the way,
and bu&s;ine&s;s will not follow him that runs away
from it: &s;uppo&s;e a &s;hip-chandler &s;hould &s;et up
in <HI>Holbourn,</HI> or a block-maker in <HI>Whitecro&s;s-&s;treet,</HI>
an anchor-&s;mith at <HI>Moorgate,</HI> or a coach|maker
in <HI>Redriff,</HI> and the like?</P>
<P>IT is true, we have &s;een a kind of fate at|tend
the very &s;treets and rows where &s;uch trades
have been gather'd together; and a &s;treet famous
<PB N="100" REF="117">
&s;ome years ago, &s;hall, in a few years after, be
quite for&s;aken; as <HI>Pater-no&s;ter-row</HI> for mercers,
<HI>St. Paul</HI>'s church yard for woollen-drapers, both
the <HI>Ea&s;tcheaps</HI> for butchers; and now you &s;ee
hardly any of tho&s;e trades le&s;t in tho&s;e places.</P>
<P>I mention it for this rea&s;on, and this makes
it to my purpo&s;e in an extraordinary manner,
that whenever the principal &s;hop-keepers re|move
from &s;uch a &s;treet, or &s;ettled place where
the principal trade u&s;ed to be, the re&s;t &s;oon
follow; knowing, that if the fame of the trade
is not there, the cu&s;tomers will not re&s;ort thi|ther:
and that a trade&s;man's bu&s;ine&s;s is to fol|low
wherever the trade leads. For a mercer to
&s;et up now in <HI>Pater-no&s;ter-row,</HI> or a woollen
draper in <HI>St. Paul</HI>'s church-yard; the one among
the &s;em&s;tre&s;&s;es, and the other among the chair|makers;
would be the &s;ame thing as for a count|ry
&s;hop-keeper not to &s;et up in or near the
market-place.</P>
<P>THE place therefore is to be prudently cho&s;en
by the retailer, when he fir&s;t begins his bu&s;ine&s;s,
that he may put him&s;elf in the way of bu&s;ine&s;s;
and then, with God's ble&s;&s;ing, and his own care,
he may expect his &s;hare of trade with his neigh|bours.</P>
<P>2. HE mu&s;t take an e&s;pecial care to have his
&s;hop not &s;o much crouded with a large bulk of
goods, as with a well-&s;orted, and well-cho&s;en
quantity, proper for his bu&s;ine&s;s, and to give
credit to his beginning; in order to this, his
buying part requires not only a good judgment
in the wares he is to deal in, but a perfect go|vernment
of his judgment by his under&s;tanding
<PB N="101" REF="118">
to &s;uit and &s;ort his quantities and proportions,
as well to his &s;hop, as to the particular place
where his &s;hop is &s;ituate; for example, a parti|cular
trade is not only proper for &s;uch or &s;uch
a part of the town, but a particular &s;ortment
of goods, even in the &s;ame way, &s;uits one part
of the town, or one town and not another; as
he that &s;ets up in the <HI>Strand,</HI> or near the <HI>Ex|change,</HI>
is likely to &s;ell more rich &s;ilks, more
fine hollands, more fine broad-cloths, more fine
toys and trinkets, than one of the &s;ame trade,
&s;etting up in the skirts of the town, or at <HI>Rat|cliff,</HI>
or <HI>Wapping,</HI> or <HI>Redriff;</HI> and he that &s;ets
up in the capital city of a county, than he that
is plac'd in a private market-town, in the &s;ame
county; and he that is placed in a market-town,
than he that is plac'd in a country village.
A trade&s;man in a &s;ea-port town &s;orts him&s;elf
different from one of the &s;ame trade in an in|land
town, tho' larger and more populous; and
this the trade&s;man mu&s;t weigh very maturely
before he lays out his &s;tock.</P>
<P>SOMETIMES it happens a trade&s;man &s;erves his
apprentice&s;hip in one town, and &s;ets up in an|other;
and &s;ometimes circum&s;tances altering, he
removes from one town to another; the change
is very important to him, for the goods which
he is to &s;ell in the town he removes to, are
&s;ometimes &s;o differing from the &s;orts of goods
which he &s;old in the place he removed from,
tho' in the &s;ame way of trade, that he is at a
great lo&s;s both in changing his hand, and in the
judgment of buying. This made me in&s;i&s;t, in
one of my letters, that a trade&s;man &s;hould take
<PB N="102" REF="119">
all occa&s;ions to extend his knowledge in every
kind of goods, that which way &s;oever he may
turn his hand, he may have judgment in every
thing.</P>
<P>IN thus changing his circum&s;tances of trade, he
mu&s;t learn, as well as he 'can, how to furni&s;h his
&s;hop &s;uitable to the place he is to trade in, and
to &s;ort his goods to the demand which he is
like to have there; otherwi&s;e he will not only
lo&s;e the cu&s;tomers for want of proper goods,
but will very much lo&s;e by the goods which he
lays in for &s;ale, there being no demand for
them where he is going.</P>
<P>WHEN merchants &s;end adventures to our <HI>Bri|ti&s;h</HI>
colonies, 'tis u&s;ual with them to make up
to each factor what they call a <HI>&s;ortable cargoe;</HI>
that is to &s;ay, they want &s;omething of every
thing that may furni&s;h the trade&s;men there with
parcels fit to fill their &s;hops, and invite their
cu&s;tomers; and if they fail, and do not thus
&s;ort their cargoes, the factors there not only
complain, as being ill-&s;orted, but the cargoe
lies by un&s;old, becau&s;e there is not a &s;ufficient
quantity of &s;orts to an&s;wer the demand, and
make them all marketable together.</P>
<P>IT is the &s;ame thing here; if the trade&s;man's
&s;hop is not well &s;orted, it is not &s;uitably fur|ni&s;hed,
or fitted to &s;upply his cu&s;tomers; and
nothing di&s;honours him more than to have
people come to buy things u&s;ual to be had in
&s;uch &s;hops, and go away without them. The
next thing they &s;ay to one another is, I went to
that &s;hop, but I could not be furni&s;h'd; they are
not &s;tock'd there for a trade; one &s;eldom finds
<PB N="103" REF="120">
any thing there that is new or fa&s;hionable:
and &s;o they go away to another &s;hop; and not
only go away them&s;elves, but carry others away
with them, for it is ob&s;ervable, that the buyers,
or retale cu&s;tomers, e&s;pecially the Ladies, follow
one another as &s;heep follow the flock; and if one
buys a beautiful &s;ilk, or a cheap piece of <HI>Holland,</HI>
or a new-fa&s;hioned thing of any kind, the next en|quiry
is, where it was bought? and the &s;hop is pre|&s;ently
recommended for a &s;hop well &s;orted, and
for a place where things are to be had not only
cheap and good, but of the newe&s;t fa&s;hion,
and where they have always great choice to
plea&s;e the curious, and to &s;upply whatever is
call'd for. And thus the trade runs way in&s;en|&s;ibly
to the &s;hops which are be&s;t &s;orted.</P>
<P>3. THE retale trade&s;man in e&s;pecial, but even
every trade&s;man in his &s;tation, mu&s;t furni&s;h him|&s;elf
with a competent &s;tock of patience; I mean
that patience which is needful to bear with all
&s;orts of impertinence, and the mo&s;t provoking
curio&s;ity that it is po&s;&s;ible to imagin the buyers,
even the wor&s;t of them, are or can be guilty
of. A trade&s;man behind his counter mu&s;t have
no fle&s;h and blood about him, no pa&s;&s;ions, no
re&s;entment; he mu&s;t never be angry, no not &s;o
much as &s;eem to be &s;o: if a cu&s;tomer tumbles
him five hundred pounds worth of goods, and
&s;carce bids money for any thing; nay, tho'
they really come to his &s;hop with no intent to
buy, as many do, only to &s;ee what is to be
&s;old, and if they cannot be better pleas'd than
they are at &s;ome other &s;hop where they intend
to buy, 'tis all one, the trade&s;man mu&s;t take it,
<PB N="104" REF="121">
and place it to the account of his calling, that
'tis his bu&s;ine&s;s to be ill u&s;ed and re&s;ent no|thing;
and &s;o mu&s;t an&s;wer as obligingly to
tho&s;e that give him an hour or two's trouble
and buy nothing, as he does to tho&s;e who in
half the time lay out ten or twenty pounds.
The ca&s;e is plain, 'tis his bu&s;ine&s;s to get money,
to &s;ell and plea&s;e, and if &s;ome do give him
trouble and do not buy, others make him a|mends,
and do buy; and as for the trouble, 'tis
the bu&s;ine&s;s of his &s;hop.</P>
<P>I have heard that &s;ome Ladies, and tho&s;e too
per&s;ons of good note, have taken their coaches
and &s;pent a whole afternoon in <HI>Ludgate&s;treet,</HI>
or <HI>Covent Garden,</HI> only to divert them&s;elves in
going from one mercer's &s;hop to another, to
look upon their fine &s;ilks, and to rattle and
banter the journeymen and &s;hopkeepers, and
have not &s;o much as the lea&s;t occa&s;ion, much
le&s;s intention to buy any thing; nay, not &s;o
much as carrying any money out with them to
buy any thing if they fancied it: yet this the
mercers who under&s;tand them&s;elves know their
bu&s;ine&s;s too well to re&s;ent, nor if they really
knew it, would they take the lea&s;t notice of it,
but perhaps tell the ladies they were welcome
to look upon their goods; that it was their bu|&s;ine&s;s
to &s;hew them, and that if they did not
come to buy now, they might perhaps &s;ee they
were furni&s;h'd to plea&s;e them when they might
have occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>ON the other hand, I have been told that
&s;ometimes tho&s;e &s;orts of ladies have been catch'd
in their own &s;hare; that is to &s;ay, have been &s;o
<PB N="105" REF="122">
engaged by the good u&s;age of the &s;hop-keeper,
and &s;o unexpectedly &s;urpriz'd with &s;ome fine
thing or other, that has been &s;hewn them, that
they have been drawn in by their fancy, again&s;t
their de&s;ign, to lay out money, whether they
had it or no; that is to &s;ay, to buy, and &s;end
home for money to pay for it.</P>
<P>BUT let it be how and which way it will,
whether mercer or draper, or what trade you
plea&s;e, the man that &s;tands behind the counter
mu&s;t be all courte&s;y, civility and good man|ners;
he mu&s;t not be affronted, or any way

to ca&s;ualty or de&s;ign; if he &s;ees him&s;elf ill u&s;ed,

not appear to &s;ee it, nor any way &s;hew di&s;like
or di&s;ta&s;te; if he does, he reproaches not only
him&s;elf, but his &s;hop, and puts an ill name up|on
the general u&s;age of cu&s;tomers in it; and 'tis
not to be imagined how, in this go&s;&s;iping Tea-drinking
age, the &s;candal will run, even among
people who have had no knowledge of the per|&s;on
fir&s;t complaining. Such a &s;hop! (&s;ays a cer|tain
Lady to a citizen's wife, in conver&s;ation as
they were going to buy clothes) I am re&s;olv'd I
won't go to it, the fellow that keeps it is &s;aucy

be well u&s;ed; if I don't lay it out, I expect to
be well treated.</P>

<P>I don't know, really, I have forgot

<P>O! Madam, I remember now who
told me; it was my Lady <HI>Tattle,</HI> when I was
at Mrs. <HI>Whym&s;y</HI>'s on a vi&s;iting day; it was the
talk of the whole circle, and all the Ladies took
notice of it, and &s;aid they would take care to
&s;hun that &s;hop.</P>

<P>SURE, Madam, the Lady was &s;trangely

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, I did not under&s;tand that &s;he told
the particulars, for it &s;eems it was not to her,
but to &s;ome other Lady, a friend of hers; but it
was all one, the company took as much notice
of it as if it had been to her, and re&s;ented it
as much, I a&s;&s;ure you.</P>

when they came there the Lady was &s;urpriz'd,
the &s;hop was &s;hut up, and no body to be &s;een.
The next door was a laceman's, and the jour|neyman
<PB N="109" REF="126">
being at the door, the Lady &s;ent her
&s;ervant to de&s;ire him to &s;peak a word or two
to her; and when he came, &s;ays the Lady to

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lacem.</SPEAKER>
<P>SOMETHING wor&s;e, Madam, he has
had &s;ome misfortunes.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am very &s;orry to hear it, indeed&mdash;
So her Ladi&s;hip made her bow, and her coach|man
drove away.</P>
</SP>
<P>THE &s;hort of the &s;tory was, her mercer was
broke; upon which the city Lady prevail'd up|on
her Ladi&s;hip to go to the other &s;hop;
which &s;he did, but declar'd beforehand &s;he
would buy nothing, but give the mercer all
the trouble &s;he could; and &s;o &s;aid the other.
And to make the thing more &s;ure, &s;he would
have them go into the &s;hop &s;ingle, becau&s;e &s;he
fancy'd the mercer knew the city Lady, and
therefore would behave more civilly to them
both on that account, the other having laid out
her money there &s;everal times. Well, they
went in, and the Lady ask'd for &s;uch and &s;uch rich
things, and had them &s;hew'd her, to a variety
that &s;he was &s;urpriz'd at; but not the be&s;t or
riche&s;t things they could &s;hew her gave her any
&s;atisfaction; either &s;he did not like the pattern,
or the colours did not &s;uit her fancy, or they
<PB N="110" REF="127">
were too dear; and &s;o &s;he prepares to leave
the &s;hop, her coach &s;tanding at a di&s;tance, which
&s;he order'd, that they might not gue&s;s at her
quality.</P>
<P>BUT &s;he was quite deceiv'd in her expecta|tion;
for the mercer, far from treating her
in the manner as &s;he had heard, u&s;ed her with
the utmo&s;t civility and good manners. She
treated him, on the contrary, as &s;he &s;aid her
&s;elf, even with a forced rudene&s;s; &s;he gave him
all the impertinent trouble &s;he was able, as a|bove;
and, pretending to like nothing he &s;hew'd,
turn'd away with an air of contempt, intimat|ing
that his &s;hop was ill furni&s;h'd, and that &s;he
&s;hould be ea&s;ily &s;erved, &s;he doubted not, at an|other.</P>
<P>HE told her he was very unhappy in not hav|ing
any thing that &s;uited her fancy; that if &s;he
knew what particular things would plea&s;e her,
he would have them in two hours time for her
if all the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Italian</HI> merchants ware|hou&s;es
in <HI>London,</HI> or all the weavers looms in
<HI>Spittlefields</HI> could furni&s;h them. But when that
would not do, &s;he comes forward from his
back-&s;hop, where &s;he had plagued him about an
hour and half, and makes him the &s;light com|pliment
of, (in a kind of a &s;cornful tone too,)
<HI>I am &s;orry I have given you &s;o much trouble.</HI></P>
<P>THE trouble, Madam, is nothing, 'tis my
misfortune not to plea&s;e you; but as to trouble,
my bu&s;ine&s;s is to oblige the Ladies my cu&s;tomers;
if I &s;hew my goods, I may &s;ell them; if I do
not &s;hew them, I cannot: if it is not a trouble
to you, I'll &s;hew you ever piece of goods in
<PB N="111" REF="128">
my &s;hop; if you do not buy now, you may
perhaps buy another time. And thus, in &s;hort,
he pur&s;ued her with all the good words in the
world, and waited on her towards the door.</P>
<P>As &s;he comes forward, there &s;he &s;py'd the
city Lady, who had ju&s;t us'd the partner as the
Lady had us'd the chief ma&s;ter; and there, as
if it had been by mere chance, &s;he &s;alutes her
with, Your &s;ervant, cou&s;in, pray what brought
you here? The cou&s;in an&s;wers, Madam, I am
mighty glad to &s;ee your Ladi&s;hip here; I have
been haggling here a good while, but this gen|tleman
and I can't bargain, and I was ju&s;t a go|ing
away.</P>
<P>WHY then, &s;ays the Lady, you have been
ju&s;t &s;uch another cu&s;tomer as I, for I have troub|led
the gentleman mercer this two hours, and I
can't meet with any thing to my mind. So a|way
they go together to the door, and the La|dy
gets the mercer to &s;end one of his &s;ervants
to bid her coachman drive to the door, &s;hewing
him where the fellow &s;tood.</P>
<P>WHILE the boy was gone, &s;he takes the city
Lady a&s;ide, and talking &s;oftly, the mercer and
his partner, &s;eeing them talk together, with|drew;
but waited at a di&s;tance to be ready to
hand them to the coach. So they began a new
di&s;cour&s;e, as follows:</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>WELL, &s;ays &s;he to the city Lady, I
am &s;atisfy'd this man has been ill u&s;ed in the

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>

goods to a &s;urpri&s;ing quantity and value, I con|fe&s;s.</P>

I have perfectly abu&s;ed him for having nothing
to plea&s;e me; I did as good as tell him I believ'd
he was going to break, and that he had no

<P>WELL, Madam, if you re&s;olve to buy,
let us go and look again.</P>

<P>Come then&mdash;and upon that the La|dy
turning to the mercer, Come, Sir, &s;ays &s;he,
I think I'll look upon that piece of brocade a|gain,
I can't find in my heart to give you all
this trouble for nothing.</P>
</SP>
<P>MADAM, &s;ays the mercer, I &s;hall be very
glad if I can be &s;o happy as to plea&s;e you; but I
be&s;ecch your Ladi&s;hip don't &s;peak of the trouble,
<PB N="114" REF="131">
for that is the duty of our trade; we mu&s;t ne|ver
think our bu&s;ine&s;s a trouble.</P>
<P>UPON this the Ladies went back with him
into his inner-&s;hop, and laid out between &s;ix|ty
and &s;eventy pounds, for they both bought
rich &s;uits of cloths, and u&s;ed his &s;hop for many
years after.</P>
<P>THE &s;hort inference from this long di&s;cour&s;e
is this, That here you &s;ee, and I could give
many examples very like this, how, and in what
manner, a &s;hop-keeper is to behave him&s;elf in
the way of his bu&s;ine&s;s; what impertinences,
what taunts, flouts, and ridiculous things, he
mu&s;t bear in his bu&s;ine&s;s, and mu&s;t not &s;hew the,
lea&s;t return, or the lea&s;t &s;ignal of di&s;gu&s;t: he
mu&s;t have no pa&s;&s;ions, no fire in his temper;
he mu&s;t be all &s;oft and &s;mooth; nay, if his real
temper be naturally fiery and hot, he mu&s;t &s;hew
none of it in his &s;hop; he mu&s;t be a perfect
<HI>complete hypocrite,</HI> if he will be a <HI>complete
trade&s;man.</HI></P>
<P>IT is true, natural tempers are not to be al|ways
counterfeited, the man cannot ea&s;ily be
a lamb in his &s;hop, and a lion in him&s;elf; but
let it be ea&s;y or hard, it mu&s;t be done, and it is
done: there are men who have by cu&s;tom and
u&s;age brought them&s;elves to it, that nothing
could be meeker and milder than they, when
behind the counter, and yet nothing be more fu|rious
and racing in every other parr of life; nay,
the provocations they have met with in their
&s;hops have &s;o irritated their rage, that they
would go up &s;tairs from their &s;hop, and fall
into frenzies, and a kind of madne&s;s, and beat
<PB N="115" REF="132">
their heads again&s;t the wall, and mi&s;chief them|&s;elves,
if not prevented, till the violence of it
had gotten vent, and the pa&s;&s;ions abate and
cool. Nay, I heard once of a &s;hop-keeper that
behav'd him&s;elf thus to &s;uch an extreme, that
when he was provok'd by the impertinence of
the cu&s;tomers, beyond what his temper could
bear, he would go up &s;tairs and beat his
wife, kick his children about like dogs, and be
as furious for two or three minutes, as a man
chain'd down in <HI>Bedlam,</HI> and when the heat
was over, would &s;it down and cry fa&s;ter than
the children he had abu&s;ed; and after the fit
was over he would go down into his &s;hop again,
and be as humble, as courteous, and as calm
as any man whatever; &s;o ab&s;olute a government
of his pa&s;&s;ions had he in the &s;hop, and &s;o little
out of it; in the &s;hop a &s;oul-le&s;s animal that can
re&s;ent nothing, and in the family a madman;
in the &s;hop meek like the lamb, but in the fa|mily
outrageous like a <HI>Lybean</HI> lion.</P>
<P>THE &s;um of the matter is this, it is nece&s;&s;ary
for a trade&s;man to &s;ubject him&s;elf, by all the ways
po&s;&s;ible, to his bui&s;ne&s;s; his cu&s;tomers are to be
his idols: &s;o far as he may wor&s;hip idols by al|lowance,
he is to bow down to them, and
wor&s;hip them; at lea&s;t, he is not any way to
di&s;plea&s;e them, or &s;hew any di&s;gu&s;t: or di&s;ta&s;te at
any thing they &s;ay or do; the bottom of it all
is, that he is intending to get money by them;
and it is not for him that gets money by them
to offer the lea&s;t inconvenience to them by
whom he gets it; but he is to con&s;ider, that as
<PB N="116" REF="133">
<HI>Solomon</HI> &s;ays, <HI>The borrower is &s;ervant to the lender,</HI> &s;o the <HI>&s;eller</HI> is &s;ervant to the <HI>buyer.</HI></P>
<P>WHEN a trade&s;man has thus conquered all
his pa&s;&s;ions, and can &s;tand before the &s;torm
of impertinence, he is &s;aid to be fitted up for
the main atticle, namely, the in&s;ide of the
counter.</P>
<P>ON the other hand, we &s;ee that the contra|ry
temper, nay, but the very &s;ugge&s;tion of it,
hurries people on to ruin their trade, to di&s;|oblige
the cu&s;tomers, to quarrel with them, and
drive them away: we &s;ee by the Lady above,
after having &s;een the ways &s;he had taken to put
this man out of temper; I &s;ay, you &s;ee it con|quer'd
her temper, and brought her to lay out
her money chearfully, and be his cu&s;tomer ever
after.</P>
<P>A &s;owre, moro&s;e, dogmatick temper would
have &s;ent the&s;e Ladies both away with their
money in their pockets; but the man's patience

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Other Rea&s;ons for the trade&s;man's Di&s;a&s;|ters:
and fir&s;t of innocent Diver&s;ions.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_A FEW directions &s;ea&s;onably given, and
wi&s;ely received, will be &s;ufficient to
guide a trade&s;man in a right manage|ment
of his bu&s;ine&s;s, &s;o as that, if he
ob&s;erves them, he may &s;ecure his pro&s;perity
and &s;ucce&s;s: but it requires a long and &s;erious
caveat to warn him of the dangers he meets
with in his way. Trade is a &s;trait and direct
way, if they will but keep in it with a &s;teady
foot, and not wander, and launch out here and
there, as a loo&s;e head and giddy fancy will
prompt them to do.</P>
<P>THE road, I &s;ay, is &s;trait and direct; but there
are many turnings and openings in it, both to
the right hand and to the left, in which if a
trade&s;man, but once ventures to &s;tep awry, it is
ten thou&s;and to one but he lo&s;es him&s;elf, and
very rarely finds his way back again; at lea&s;t if
he does, 'tis like a man that has been lo&s;t in a
wood, he comes out with a &s;cratch'd face, and
torn cloaths, tired and &s;pent, and does not re|cover
him&s;elf in a long while after.</P>
<P><PB N="118" REF="135">
IN a word, one &s;teady motion carries him up,
but many things a&s;&s;i&s;t to pull him down; there
are many ways open, to his ruin, but few to his
ri&s;ing; and tho' employment is &s;aid to be the
be&s;t fence again&s;t temptations, and he that is
bu&s;y heartily in his bu&s;ine&s;s, temptations to
idlene&s;s and negligence will not be &s;o bu&s;y a|bout
him; yet trade&s;men are as often, drawn
from their bu&s;ine&s;s as other men, and when
they are &s;o, it is more fatal to them a great
deal, than it is to gentlemen, and per&s;ons who&s;e
employments do not call for their per&s;onal at|tendance
&s;o much as a &s;hop does.</P>
<P>AMONG the many turnings and by-lanes
which, as I &s;ay, are to be met with in the &s;trait
road of trade, there are two as dangerous and
fatal to their pro&s;perity as the wor&s;t, tho' they
both carry an appearance of good, and promi&s;e
contrary to what they perform; the&s;e are,</P>
<P>I. PLEASURES and DIVERSIONS, e&s;pecially
&s;uch as they will have us call <HI>innocent Diver|&s;ions.</HI></P>
<P>II. PROJECTS and ADVENTURES, and efpeci|ally
&s;uch as promi&s;e mountains of profit <HI>in nu|bibus,</HI>
and are therefore the more likely to en|&s;nare
the poor eager avaritious trade&s;man.</P>
<P>1. I am now to &s;peak of the fir&s;t, <HI>viz.</HI> plea|&s;ures
and diver&s;ions. I cannot allow any plea|&s;ures
to be innocent, when they turn away
either the body or rhe mind of a trade&s;man
from the one needful thing which his calling
<PB N="119" REF="136">
makes nece&s;&s;ary, and that nece&s;&s;ity makes his
duty; I mean, the application both of his
hands and head to his bu&s;ine&s;s; tho&s;e plea&s;ures
and diver&s;ions may he innocent in them&s;elves,
which are not &s;o to him: there are very few
things in the world that are &s;imply evil, but
things are made circumstantially evil when they
are not &s;o in them&s;elves: killing a man is not
&s;imply &s;inful; on the contrary, 'tis not lawful
only, but a duty, when ju&s;tice and the laws of
God or man require it; but when done mali|ciou&s;ly,
from any corrupt principle, or to any
corrupted end, is murther, and the wor&s;t of
crimes.</P>
<P>PLEASURES and diver&s;ions are thus made
criminal, when a man is engaged in duty
to a full attendance upon &s;uch bu&s;ine&s;s as
tho&s;e plea&s;ures and diver&s;ions nece&s;&s;arily in|terfere
with, and interrupt; tho&s;e pleasures,
tho' innocent in them&s;elves, become a fault in
him, becau&s;e his legal avocations demand his
attendance in another place. Thus tho&s;e plea|&s;ures
may be lawful to another man, which
are not &s;o to him, becau&s;e another man has
not the &s;ame obligation to a calling, the &s;ame
nece&s;&s;ity to apply to it, the &s;ame cry of a fa|mily,
who&s;e bread may depend upon his dili|gence,
as a trade&s;man has.</P>
<P><HI>SOLOMON,</HI> the royal patron of indu&s;try,
tells us, <HI>He that is a lover of plea&s;ure, &s;hall
be a poor man;</HI> I mu&s;t not doubt but <HI>Solomon</HI>
is to be under&s;tood of <HI>trade&s;men</HI> and <HI>working
men,</HI> &s;uch as I am writing of, who&s;e time and
application is due to their bu&s;ine&s;s, and who in
<PB N="120" REF="137">
per&s;uit of their <HI>plea&s;ures,</HI> are &s;ure to neglect
their &s;hops, or employments, and I therefore
render the words thus, to the pre&s;ent purpo&s;e,
<HI>The trade&s;man that is a lover of plea&s;ure, &s;hall
be a poor man.</HI> I hope I do not wre&s;t the
&s;cripture in my interpretation of it, I am &s;ure
it agrees with the whole <HI>tenor</HI> of the wi&s;eman's
other di&s;cour&s;es.</P>
<P>WHEN I &s;ee young &s;hop-keepers keep
hor&s;es ride a hunting, learn dog-language, and
keep the &s;port&s;mens brogue upon their tongues,
I will not &s;ay I read their de&s;tiny, for I am no
<HI>fortune-teller;</HI> but I do &s;ay, I am always afraid
for them; e&s;pecially when I know that either
their fortunes and beginnings are below it, or
that their trades are &s;uch as in a particular man|ner
require their con&s;tant attendance; as to &s;ee
a barber abroad on a <HI>Saturday,</HI> a corn-factor
abroad on a <HI>Wedne&s;day</HI> and <HI>Friday,</HI> or a <HI>Black|well-hall</HI>
man on a <HI>Thur&s;day,</HI> you may as well
&s;ay a country &s;hop-keeper &s;hould go a hunting
on a market-day, or go a fea&s;ting at the fair-day
of the town where he lives; and yet riding and
hunting are otherwi&s;e lawful diver&s;ions, and in
their kind very good for exerci&s;e and health.</P>
<P>I am not for making a galley-&s;lave of a &s;hop-keeper,
and have him chain'd down to the oar;
but if he be a wi&s;e, a prudent and a diligent
trrade&s;man, he will allow him&s;elf as few excur|&s;ions
as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>BUSINESS neglected is bu&s;ine&s;s lo&s;t; 'tis true,
there are &s;ome bu&s;ine&s;&s;es which require le&s;s at|tendance
than others, and give a man le&s;s occa|&s;ion
of application; but in general, that <HI>trade&s;|man</HI>
<PB N="121" REF="138">
who can &s;atisfy him&s;elf to be ab&s;ent from
his bu&s;ine&s;s, mu&s;t not expert &s;ucce&s;s; if he is
above the character of a diligent trade&s;man, he
mu&s;t then be above the bu&s;ine&s;s too, and &s;hould
leave it to &s;omebody that having more need of
it will think it worth his while to mind it bet|ter.</P>
<P>NOR indeed is it po&s;&s;ible a trade&s;man &s;hould
be ma&s;ter of any of the qualifications which I
have &s;et down to denominate him <HI>complete,</HI> if
he neglects his &s;hop and his time, following his
plea&s;ures and diver&s;ions.</P>
<P>I'LL allow that the man is not vicious and
wicked, that he is not addicted to drunkenne&s;s,
to women, to gaming, or any &s;uch things as
tho&s;e, for tho&s;e are not woundings, but mur|ther,
downright killing; a man may wound
and hurt him&s;elf &s;ometimes, in the rage of an
ungovern'd pa&s;&s;ion, or in a frenzy or fever, and
intend no more; but if he &s;hoots him&s;elf thro'
the head, or hangs him&s;elf, we are &s;ure then he
intended to kill and de&s;troy him&s;elf, and he dies
inevitably.</P>
<P>For a trade&s;man to follow his plea&s;ures,
which indeed is generally attended with a &s;light|ing
his bu&s;ine&s;s, leaving his &s;hop to &s;ervants or
others, 'tis evident to me that he is indifferent
whether it thrives or no, and above all, 'tis
evident, that his heart is not in his bu&s;ine&s;s;
that he does not delight in it, or look on it
with plea&s;ure. To a complete trade&s;man there
is no plea&s;ure equal to that of being in his bu&s;i|ne&s;s,
no delight equal to that of &s;eeing him&s;elf
thrive, to &s;ee trade flow in upon him, and
<PB N="122" REF="139">
to be &s;atisfied that he goes on pro&s;perou&s;ly: He
will never thrive, that cares not whether he
thrives or no: As trade is the chief employment
of his life, and is therefore called, by way of
eminence, <HI>his bu&s;ine&s;s;</HI> &s;o it &s;hould be made
the chief delight of his life: The trade&s;man that
does not love his bu&s;ine&s;s, will never give it
due attendance.</P>
<P>PLEASURE is a bait to the mind, and the mind
will attract the body; where the heart is, the
object &s;hall always have the body's company.
The great objection I meet with from young
tradesmen again&s;t this argument, is, they fol|low
no unlawful plea&s;ures; they do not &s;pend
their time in taverns, and drinking to exce&s;s;
they do not &s;pend their money in gaming, and
&s;o &s;tock-&s;tarve their bu&s;ine&s;s, and rob the &s;hop
to &s;upply the extravagant lo&s;&s;s of play; or they
do not &s;pend their hours in ill company, de|baucheries
and whoring; all they do, is a little
innocent diver&s;ion in riding abroad now and
then for the air, and for their health, and to ea&s;e
their thoughts of the throneg of other affairs
which are heavy upon them, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>THESE, I &s;ay, are the excu&s;es of young trade&s;men,
and indeed they are young excu&s;es; and I
may &s;ay truly, have nothing in them. It is
perhaps true, or I may grant it &s;o for the pre|&s;ent
purpo&s;e, that the plea&s;ure the trade&s;man
takes is, as he &s;ays, not unlawful, and that he
follows only a little innocent diver&s;ion; but let
me tell him, the words are ill put together,
and the diver&s;ion is rather recommended from
the word <HI>little,</HI> than from the word <HI>innocent:</HI>
<PB N="123" REF="140">
if it be indeed but little, it may be innocent;
but the ca&s;e is quite altered by the extent of the
thing; and the innocence lies here, not in the
nature of the thing, not in the diver&s;ion or
plea&s;ure that is taken, but in the time it takes;
for if the man &s;pends the time in it which
&s;hould be &s;pent in his &s;hop or warchou&s;e, and
his bu&s;ine&s;s &s;uffers by his ab&s;ence, as it mu&s;t do,
if the ab&s;ence is long at a time, or often prac|ti&s;ed;
the diver&s;ion &s;o taken becomes criminal
to him, tho' the &s;ame diver&s;ion might be inno|cent
in another.</P>
<P>THUS I have heard a young trade&s;man, who
lov'd his bottle, excu&s;e him&s;elf, and &s;ay, 'tis
true, I have been at the tavern, but I was treat|ed,
it co&s;t me nothing. And this, he thinks,
clears him of all blame; not considering that
when he &s;pends no money, yet he &s;pends five
times the value of the money in time. Another
&s;ays, Why indeed I was at the tavern ye&s;terday
all the afternoon, but I could not help it, and
I &s;pent but &s;ixpence. But at the &s;ame time per|haps
it might be &s;aid he &s;pent five pounds
worth of time, his bu&s;ine&s;s being neglected, his
&s;hop unattended, his books not po&s;ted, his let|ters
not written, and the like; for all thofe
things are works nece&s;&s;ary to a trade&s;man, as
well as the attendance on his &s;hop, and infinitely
above the plea&s;ure of being treated at the ex|pence
of his time. All manner of plea&s;ures
&s;hould buckle and be &s;ub&s;ervient to bu&s;ine&s;s;
he that makes his plea&s;ure be his bu&s;ine&s;s, will
never make his bu&s;ine&s;s be a plea&s;ure: Innocent
plea&s;ures become &s;inful, when they are u&s;ed to
<PB N="124" REF="141">
exce&s;s, and c&s;o it is here; the mo&s;t innocent di|ver&s;ion
becomes criminal, when it breaks in
upon that which is the due and ju&s;t employ|ment
of the man's life. Plea&s;ures rob the
trade&s;man, and how then can he call them in|nocent
diver&s;ions? they are downright thieves,
they rob his &s;hop of his attendance, and of the
time which he ought to be&s;tow there; they
rob his family of their due &s;upport, by the man's
neglecting that bu&s;ine&s;s by which they are to
be &s;upported and maintained; and they often|times
rob the creditors of their ju&s;t debts, the
trade&s;man &s;inking by the inordinate u&s;e of tho&s;e
innocent diver&s;ions, as he calls them, as well
by the expence attending them, as the lo&s;s of
his time, and neglect of his bu&s;ine&s;s, by which
he is at la&s;t reduced to the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;hut|ing
up &s;hop in earne&s;t, which was indeed as good as
&s;hut before. A &s;hop without a ma&s;ter,
is like the &s;ame &s;hop on a middling holiday,
half &s;hut up; and he that keeps it long &s;o, need
not doubt but he may in a little time more,
&s;hut it quite up.</P>
<P>IN &s;hort, plea&s;ure is <HI>a thief</HI> to bu&s;ine&s;s; how
any man can call it innocent, let him an&s;wer
that does &s;o; it robs him every way, as I have
&s;aid above; and if the trade&s;man be a chri&s;tian,
and has any regard to religion and his duty, I
mu&s;t tell him, that when, upon his di&s;a&s;ters, he
&s;hall reflect, and &s;ee that he has ruin'd him&s;elf
and his family, by following too much tho&s;e
diver&s;ions and plea&s;ures which he thought in|nocent,
and which perhaps in them&s;elves were
really &s;o, he will find great cau&s;e to repent of
<PB N="125" REF="142">
that which he in&s;i&s;ted on as innocent; he will
find him&s;elf lo&s;t, by doing lawful things, and that
he made tho&s;e innocent things &s;inful, and tho&s;e
lawful things unlawful to him. Thus, as they
robb'd his family and creditors before of their ju&s;t
debts, (for maintenance is a trade&s;man's ju&s;t debt to
his family, and a wife and children are as much
a trade&s;man's real creditors, as tho&s;e who tru&s;ted
him with their goods;) I &s;ay, as his innocent plea|&s;ures
robb'd his family and creditors before, they
will rob him now of his peace, and of all that
calm of &s;oul which an hone&s;t, indu&s;trious, tho' un|fortunate
trade&s;man meets with under his di&s;a&s;ters.</P>
<P>I am ask'd here, perhaps, how much plea&s;ure
an hone&s;t-meaning trade&s;man may be allow'd
to take? for it cannot be &s;uppos'd I &s;hould in|&s;i&s;t
that all plea&s;ure is forbidden him, that he
mu&s;t have no diver&s;ion, no &s;pare hours, no in|tervals
from hurry and fatigue; that would be
to pin him down to the very floor of his &s;hop,
as <HI>John Sheppard</HI> was lock'd down to the floor
of his pri&s;on.</P>
<P>THE an&s;wer to this que&s;tion every prudent
trade&s;man may make for him&s;elf; if his plea|&s;ure
is in his &s;hop, and in his bu&s;ine&s;s, there is
no danger of him; but if he has an itch after
exotick diver&s;ions, I mean &s;uch as are foreign
to his &s;hop, and to his bu&s;ine&s;s, and which I
therefore call <HI>exotick,</HI> let him hone&s;tly and
fairly &s;tate the ca&s;e between his &s;hop and his di|ver&s;ions,
and judge impartially for him&s;elf; &s;o
much plea&s;ure, and no more, may be inno|cently
taken, as does not interfere with, or do
the lea&s;t damage to his bu&s;ine&s;s, by taking him
away fiom it.</P>
<P><PB N="126" REF="143">
EVERY moment that his trade wants him in
his &s;hop, or ware-hou&s;e, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> 'tis his duty to be
there; 'tis not enough to &s;ay, I believe I &s;hall
not be wanted; or, I believe I &s;hall &s;uffer no
lo&s;s by my ab&s;ence; he mu&s;t come to a point,
and not deceive him&s;elf, if he does, the cheat
is all his own: if he will not judge &s;incerely at
fir&s;t, he will reproach him&s;elf &s;incerely at la&s;t;
for there is no fraud again&s;t his own reflections,
a man is very rarely an hypocrite to him&s;elf.</P>
<P>THE rule may be, in a few words thus:
Tho&s;e plea&s;ures or diver&s;ions, and tho&s;e only,
can be innocent, which the man may or does
u&s;e, or allow him&s;elf to u&s;e, without hindrance
of, or injury to, his bu&s;i&s;ne&s;s and reputation.</P>
<P>LET the diver&s;ions or plea:&s;ures in que&s;tion
be what they will, and how innocent &s;oever
they are in them&s;elves, they are not &s;o to him;
becau&s;e they interrupt or interfere with his bu|&s;ine&s;s,
which is his immediate duty. I have
mention'd the circum&s;tance which touches this
part too, namely, that there may be a time
when even the needful duties of religion may
become faults, and un&s;ea&s;onable, when another
more needful attendance calls for us to apply
to it; much more then tho&s;e things which are
only barely lawful. There is a vi&s;ible difference
between the things which we may do, and
the things which we mu&s;t do. plea&s;ures at cer|tain
&s;ea&s;ons are allow'd, and we may give our
&s;elves &s;ome loo&s;e to them; but bu&s;ine&s;s, I mean,
to the man of bu&s;ine&s;s, is that needful thing, of
which it is not to be &s;aid it <HI>may,</HI> but it <HI>mu&s;t</HI> be
done.</P>
<P><PB N="127" REF="144">
AGAIN, tho&s;e plea&s;ures which may not only
be lawful in them&s;elves, but which may be law|ful
to other men, yet are criminal and unlaw|ful
to him. To gentlemen of fortunes and e|&s;tates,
who being born to large po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, and
have no avocations of this kind, 'tis certainly
lawful to &s;pend their &s;pare hours on hor&s;eback,
with their hounds or hawks, pur&s;uing their
game; or on foot, with their gun and their
net, and their dogs to kill the hares or birds? <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
all which we call &s;port. The&s;e are the men
that can, with a particular &s;atis&s;faction, when
they come home, &s;ay they have only taken an
innocent diver&s;ion; and yet even in the&s;e, there
are not wanting &s;ome exce&s;&s;es, which take away
the innocence of them, and con&s;equently the
&s;atisfaction in their reflection; and therefore it
was, I &s;aid it was lawful to them to &s;pend their
<HI>&s;pare hours:</HI> by which I am to be under&s;tood,
tho&s;e hours which are not due to more &s;olemn
and weighty occa&s;ions, &s;uch as the duties of re|ligion,
in particular. But as this is not my
pre&s;ent &s;ubject, I proceed; for I am not talking
to gentlemen now, but to trade&s;men.</P>
<P>THE prudent trade&s;man will in time con&s;ider
what he ought, or ought not to do, in his own
particular ca&s;e, as to his plea&s;ures; not what
another man may or may not do: In &s;hort,
nothing of plea&s;ure or diver&s;ion can be inno|cent
to him, whatever it may be to another,
if it injures his bu&s;ine&s;s, if it takes either his
time, or his mind, or his delight, or his at|tendance,
from his bu&s;ine&s;s; nor can all the
little excu&s;es, of its being for his health, and
<PB N="128" REF="145">
for the needful unbending the bow of the
mind, from the con&s;tant application of bu&s;ine&s;s;
for all the&s;e mu&s;t &s;toop to the great article of
his &s;hop and bu&s;ine&s;s; tho' I might add, that the
bare taking the air for health, and for a rece&s;s
to the mind, is not the thing I am talking of;
'tis the taking an immoderate liberty, and &s;pend|ing
an Immoderate length of time, and that at
un&s;ea&s;onable and improper hours, &s;o as to make
his plea&s;ures and diver&s;ions be prejudicial to his
bu&s;ine&s;s: this is the evil I object to, and this is too
much the ruin of the trade&s;men of this age;
and thus any man who calmly reads the&s;e pa|pers
will &s;ee I ought to be under&s;tood.</P>
<P>NOR do I confine this di&s;cour&s;e to the inno|cent
diver&s;ions of a hor&s;e and riding abroad to
take the air; things which, as above;, are made
hurtful and unlawful to him, only as they are
hindrances to his bu&s;ine&s;s, and are more or le&s;s
&s;o, as they rob his &s;hop or warehou&s;e, or bu&s;i|ne&s;s,
of his attendance and time, and cau&s;e him
to draw his affections off from his calling.</P>
<P>BUT we &s;ee other and new plea&s;ures daily
crowding in upon the trade&s;man, and &s;ome
which no age before this have been in danger
of; I mean, not to &s;uch an exce&s;s as is now the
ca&s;e, and con&s;equently there were fewer trade&s;|men
drawn Into the practice.</P>
<P>THE pre&s;ent age is a time of gallantry and
gaiety; nothing of the pre&s;ent pride and vanity
was known, or but very little of it, in former
times: the baits which are every where laid
for the corruption of youth, and for the ruin
of their fortunes, were never &s;o many and &s;o
mi&s;chievous as they are now.</P>
<P><PB N="129" REF="146">
WE &s;carce now &s;ee a trade&s;man's apprentice
come to his fifth year, but he gets a long wig
and a &s;word, and a &s;et of companions &s;uitable
and this wig and &s;word being left at proper and
convenient places are put on at night after the
&s;hop is &s;hut, or when they can make a &s;lip out
to go a raking in, and when they never fail of
company ready to lead them into all manner of
wickedne&s;s and debauchery; and from this
cau&s;e it is principally, that &s;o many apprentices
are ruin'd, and run away from their ma&s;ters be|fore
they come out of their times: more I am
per&s;uaded now, than ever were to be found
before.</P>
<P>NOR, as I &s;aid before, will I charge the de|vil
with having any hand in the ruin of the&s;e
young fellows; indeed lie needs not trouble
him&s;elf about them; they are his own by ear|ly
choice; they anticipate temptation, and are as
forward as the devil can de&s;ire them to be.
The&s;e may be truly &s;aid to be drawn a&s;ide of
their own lu&s;ts, and enticed; they need no
tempter.</P>
<P>BUT of the&s;e I may al&s;o &s;ay, they &s;eldom
trouble the trade&s;mens cla&s;s; they get ruin'd
early, and fini&s;h the trade&s;man before they be|gin;
&s;o my di&s;cour&s;e is not at pre&s;ent directed
much to them; indeed they are pa&s;t advice
before they come in my way.</P>
<P>INDEED I knew one of the&s;e &s;ort of gentle|men-apprentices
make an attempt to begin, and
&s;et up his trade: he was a dealer in what they
call <HI>Crooked-lane</HI> wares: he got about 300 <HI>l.</HI>
from his father, an hone&s;t plain countryman, to
<PB N="130" REF="147">
&s;et him up, and his &s;aid hone&s;t father exerted
him&s;elf to the utmo&s;t to &s;end him up &s;o much
money.</P>
<P>WHEN He had gotten the money, he took a
&s;hop near the place where he had &s;erved his
time, and entring upon the &s;hop, he had it
painted, and fitted up, and &s;ome goods he bought
in order to furni&s;h it; but before that, he was
obliged to pay about 70 <HI>l.</HI> of the money to li|ttle
debts which he had contracted in his appren|tice&s;hip
at two or three ale-hou&s;es for drink and
eatables, treats and junkettings; and at the
barber's for long perukes, at the &s;em&s;tre&s;&s;es for
fine holland-&s;hirts, turn-overs, white gloves, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
to make a beau of him, and at &s;everal other
places.</P>
<P>WHEN he came to dip into this, and found that it
wanted &s;till 30 or 40 <HI>l.</HI> to equip him for the com|pany
which he had learn'd to keep, he took
care to do this fir&s;t; and being delighted with
his new dre&s;s, and how like a gentleman he
look'd, he was re&s;olv'd, before he open'd &s;hop,
to take his &s;wing a little in the town; &s;o away
he went with two of his neighbour's apprentices
to the play-hou&s;e, thence to the tavern, not far
from his dwelling, and there they fell to cards,
and &s;at up all night, and thus they &s;pent about
a fortnight; the re&s;t ju&s;t creeping into their ma|&s;ter's
hou&s;es, by the connivance of their fellow-&s;ervants,
and he getting a bed in the tavern,
where what he &s;pent to be &s;ure made them wil|ling
enough to oblige him, that is to &s;ay, to
encourage him to ruin him&s;elf.</P>
<P><PB N="131" REF="148">
THEY then chang'd their cour&s;e indeed, and
went to the ball, and that nece&s;&s;arily kept them
but the mo&s;t part of the night, always having
their &s;upper dre&s;s'd at the tavern at their return;
and thus, in a few words, he went on 'till he
made way thro' all the remaining money he had
left, and was obliged to call his creditors toge|ther,
and break before he &s;o much as open'd
his &s;hop; I &s;ay, his creditors, for great part of
the goods which he had furni&s;h'd his &s;hop with
were unpaid for; perhaps &s;ome few might be
bought with ready money.</P>
<P>THIS man indeed is the only trade&s;man that
ever I met with, that &s;et up and broke before
his &s;hop was open; others I have indeed known
make very quick work of it.</P>
<P>BUT this part rather belongs to another
head. I am at pre&s;ent not talking of madmen,
as I hope indeed I am not writing to madmen,
but I am talking of trade&s;men undone by law|ful
things, by what they call innocent and harm|le&s;s
things; &s;uch as riding abroad, or walking a|broad
to take the air, and to divert them&s;elves,
dogs, gun, country-&s;port, and city-recreation;
the&s;e things are certainly lawful, and in them|&s;elves
very innocent; nay, they may be needful
for health, and to give &s;ome relaxation to the
mind hurried with too much bu&s;ine&s;s; but the
needfulne&s;s of them is &s;o much made an excu&s;e,
and the exce&s;s of them is &s;o injurious to the
trade&s;man's bu&s;ine&s;s and to his time, which
&s;hould be &s;et apart for his &s;hop and his trade,
that there are not a few trade&s;men thus lawfully
ruin'd, as I may call it; in a word, lawful or
<PB N="132" REF="149">
unlawful, their &s;hop is neglected, their bu&s;ine&s;s goes
behind hand, and 'tis all one to the &s;ubject of
breaking, and to die creditor, whether the man
was undone by being a knave, of by being a fool;
'tis all one, whether he lo&s;t his trade by &s;canda|lous
immoral negligence, or by &s;ober or religi|ous
negligence.</P>
<P>IN a word, bu&s;ine&s;s langui&s;hes, while the
trade&s;man is ab&s;ent, and neglects it, be it for his
health or for his plea&s;ure, be it in good com|pany
or in bad, be it from a good or an ill de|sign;
and if the bu&s;ine&s;s langui&s;hes, the trade&s;|man
will not be long before he langui&s;hes too;
for nothing can &s;upport the trade&s;man but his
&s;upporting his trade by a due attendance and ap|plication.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of Extravagant and Expen&s;ive Living;
another &s;tep to a Trade&s;man's di&s;a&s;ter.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_HITHERTO I have written to you
of trade&s;men ruin'd by lawful and in|nocent
diver&s;ions; and indeed the&s;e
are &s;ome of the mo&s;t dangerous pits
for a trade&s;man to fall into, becau&s;e men are
&s;o apt to be in&s;en&s;ible of the danger; a &s;hip
may as well be lo&s;t in a calm &s;mooth &s;ea, and
an ea&s;y fair gale of wind, as in a &s;torm, if
they have no pilot, or the pilot be ignorant or
unwary; and di&s;a&s;ters of that nature happen as
frequently as any others, and are as fatal; when
rocks are apparent, and the pilot bold and wil|ful
runs directly upon, them, without fear or
wit, we know the fate of the &s;hip, it mu&s;t pe|ri&s;h,
and all that are in it will inevitably be
lo&s;t; but in a &s;mooth &s;ea, a bold &s;hoar, an ea&s;y
gale, the un&s;een rocks or &s;hoals are the only
dangers, and nothing can hazard them, but the
skilfulne&s;s of the pilot: and thus it is in trade;
open debaucheries and extravagances, and a pro|fu&s;ion
of expence, as well as a general contempt
of bu&s;ine&s;s, the&s;e are open and current roads
to a trade&s;man's de&s;truction; but a &s;ilent going
<PB N="134" REF="151">
on, in per&s;uit of innocent plea&s;ures, a &s;mooth
and calm, but &s;ure neglect of his &s;hop, and
time, and bu&s;ine&s;s, will as effectually and as
&s;urely ruin the trade&s;man as the other; and tho'
the means are not &s;o &s;candalous, the effect is
as certain. But I proceed to the other.</P>
<P>NEXT to immoderate plea&s;ures, the trade&s;man
ought to be warn'd again&s;t immoderate expence.
This is a terrible article, and more particularly
&s;o to the trade&s;man, as cu&s;tom has now, as it
were on purpo&s;e for their undoing, introduc'd
a general habit of, and as it were a general in|clination
among all &s;orts of people to, an ex|pensive
way of living; to which might be ad|ded
a kind of nece&s;&s;ity of it; for that even with
the greate&s;t prudence and frugality a man can|not
now &s;upport a family with the ordinary ex|pence,
which the &s;ame family might have been
maintained with &s;ome few years ago: there is
now 1. a weight of taxes upon, almo&s;t all the
nece&s;&s;aries of life, bread and fle&s;h excepted,
as coals, &s;alt, malt, candles, &s;oap, leather, hops,
wine, fruit, and all foreign con&s;umptions. 2.
A load of pride upon the temper of the nation,
which in &s;pight of taxes and the unu&s;ual dear|ne&s;s
of every thing, yet prompts people to a pro|fu&s;ion
in their expences.</P>
<P>THIS is not &s;o properly called <HI>a tax</HI> upon
the trade&s;men; I think rather, it may be called
<HI>a plague</HI> upon them; for there is fir&s;t the dear|ne&s;s
of every nece&s;&s;ary thing to make living ex|pen&s;ive;
and &s;econdly, an unconquerable aver|&s;ion
to any re&s;traint: &s;o that the poor will be
like the rich, and the rich like the great, and
<PB N="135" REF="152">
the great like the greate&s;t; and thus the world
runs on to a kind of di&s;traction at this time;
<HI>where it will end, time mu&s;t di&s;cover.</HI></P>
<P>NOW the trade&s;man I &s;peak of, if he will
thrive, he mu&s;t re&s;olve to begin, as he can go
on; and if he does &s;o, in a word he mu&s;t re|&s;olve
to live more under re&s;traint than ever
trade&s;men of his cla&s;s u&s;ed to do; for every
nece&s;&s;ary thing being, as I have &s;aid, grown
dearer than before, he mu&s;t entirely omit all
the enjoyment of the unnece&s;&s;aries which he
might have allow'd him&s;elf before, or perhaps
be obliged to an expence beyond the income of
his trade; and in either of the&s;e ca&s;es he has
a great hard&s;hip upon him.</P>
<P>WHEN I talk of immoderate expences, I mu&s;t
be under&s;tood not yet to mean the extravagan|ces
of wickedne&s;s and debaucheries; there are
&s;o many &s;ober extravagances, and &s;o many grave
&s;edate ways for a trade&s;man's ruin, and they
are &s;o much more dangerous than tho&s;e hair|brain'd
de&s;perate ways of gaming and whoring,
that I think 'tis the be&s;t &s;ervice I can do the
trade&s;man to lay before them tho&s;e <HI>&s;unk rocks</HI>
(as the &s;eamen call them) tho&s;e &s;ecret dangers
in the fir&s;t place, that they may know how to
avoid them; and as for the other common ways,
common di&s;cretion will &s;upply them with cau|tion
for tho&s;e, and their &s;en&s;es will be their
protection.</P>
<P>The dangers to the trade&s;men, who I am di|recting
my&s;elf to, are from lawful things, and
&s;uch as before are call'd innocent,; for I am &s;peak|ing
to the &s;ober part of trade&s;men, who yet
<PB N="136" REF="153">
are often ruin'd and overthrown in trade; and
perhaps as many &s;uch mi&s;carry, as of the mad
and extravagant, particularly becau&s;e their num|ber
far exceeds them. Expen&s;ive living is a kind
of &s;low fever; it is not &s;o open, &s;o threat'ning
and dangerous, as the ordinary di&s;temper which
goes by that name, but it preys upon the &s;pi|rits,
and, when its degrees are encreas'd to an
height, is as fatal and as &s;ure ro kill as the o|ther;
'tis a &s;ecret enemy, that feeds upon the
vitals; and when it has gone its full length, and
the langui&s;hing trade&s;man is weakened ill his &s;o|lid
part, I mean his &s;tock, then it overwhelms
him at once.</P>
<P>EXPENSIVE living feeds upon the life and blood
of the trade&s;man; for it eats into the two mo&s;t
e&s;&s;ential branches of his trade, namely, his cre|dit,
and his ca&s;h; the fir&s;t is its triumph, and
the la&s;t is its food: nothing goes out to cheri&s;h
the exorbitance, but the immediate money;
expences &s;eldom go on tru&s;t, they are generally
&s;upplied and &s;upported urith ready money, what|ever
are not.</P>
<P>THIS expen&s;ive way of living con&s;i&s;ts in &s;e|veral
things, which are all indeed in their de|gree
ruinous to the trade&s;man; &s;uch as
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. EXPENSIVE hou&s;e-keeping, or family ex|travagance.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. EXPENSIVE dre&s;&s;ing, or the extravagance
of fine cloaths.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. EXPENSIVE company, or keeping company
above him&s;elf.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. EXPENSIVE equipages, making a &s;hew and
o&s;tentation of figure in the world.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P><PB N="137" REF="154">
I might take them all in bulk, and &s;ay, what
has a young trade&s;man to do with the&s;e? and
yet where is there a trade&s;man now to be found,
who is not more or le&s;s guilty? it is, as I have
&s;aid, the general vice of the times; the whole
nation are more or le&s;s in the crime; what with
nece&s;&s;ity and inclination, where is the man or
the family that lives as &s;uch families u&s;ed to
live?</P>
<P>IN &s;hort, good husbandry and frugality is
quite out of fa&s;hion, and he that goes about to
&s;et up for the practice of it, mu&s;t mortify every
thing about him that has the lea&s;t tincture of
frugality; 'tis the mode to live high, to &s;pend
more than we get, to neglect trade, contemn
care and concern, and go on without foreca&s;t,
or without con&s;ideration; and in con&s;equence
'tis the mode to go on to extremity, to break,
become bankrupt and beggars, and &s;o going off
of the trading &s;tage, leave it open for others to
come after us, and do the &s;ame.</P>
<P>TO begin with hou&s;e-kecping. I have alrea|dy
hinted, that every thing belonging to the fa|mily
-&s;ub&s;i&s;tence bears a higher price than u&s;ual,
I may &s;ay, than ever: at the &s;ame time I can
neither undertake to prove that there is more
got by &s;elling, or more ways to get it, I mean
to a trade&s;man, than there was formerly; the
con&s;equence then mu&s;t be, that the trade&s;men
do not grow rich fa&s;ter than formerly; at lea&s;t
we may venture to &s;ay this of trade&s;men and
their families, comparing them with former
times, namely, that there is not more got, and
I am &s;atisfied there is le&s;s laid up, than was
<PB N="138" REF="155">
then; or if you will have it, that trade&s;men get
le&s;s and &s;pend more than they ever did, how
they &s;hould be richer than they were in tho&s;e
times, is very hard to &s;ay.</P>
<P>THAT all things are dearer than formerly to
a hou&s;e-keeper, needs little demon&s;tration; the
taxes nece&s;&s;arily infer it from the weight of
them, and the number of the things charged;
for be&s;ides the things enumerated above, we
find all articles of foreign importation are in|crea&s;ed
by the high duties laid on them; &s;uch
as linen, <HI>e&s;pecially fine linen;</HI> &s;ilk, e&s;pecially
foreign wrought &s;ilk: every thing eatable,
drinkable and wearable, are made heavy to us
by high and exorbitant cu&s;toms and exci&s;es, as
brandies, tobacco, &s;ugar; deals and timber for
building; oil, wine, &s;pice, raw &s;ilks, callicoe,
chocolate, coffee, tea; on &s;ome of the&s;e the
duties are more than doubled: and yet that
which is mo&s;t ob&s;ervable is, that &s;uch is the
expen&s;ive humour of the times, that not a fa|mily,
no, hardly of the meane&s;t trade&s;men, but
treat their friends with wine, or punch, or fine
ale; and have their parlours let off with the
tea-table and the chocolate-pot; treats and li|quors
all exotick, foreign and new among trade&s;men,
and terrible articles in their modern ex|pences;
which have nothing to be &s;aid for
them, either as to the expence of them, or the
helps to health which they boa&s;t of: on the
contrary, they procure us rheumatick bodies, and
con&s;umptive pur&s;es, and can no way pa&s;s with
me for nece&s;&s;aries; but being needle&s;s, they add
to the expence, by &s;ending us to the doctors
<PB N="139" REF="156">
and apothecaries to cure the breaches which
they make in our health, and are them&s;elves
the very wor&s;t &s;ort of &s;uperfluities.</P>
<P>BUT I come back to nece&s;&s;aries; and e|ven
in them, family-expences are extremely
ri&s;en; provi&s;ions are higher rated; nothing of
provi&s;ions, <HI>that I know of,</HI> except only bread,
mutton, and fi&s;h, but which are made dearer
than ever? hou&s;e-rent, in almo&s;t all the cities
and towns of note in <HI>England,</HI> is exce&s;&s;ively
and extremely dearer; and that in &s;pite of &s;uch
innumerable buildings as we &s;ee almo&s;t every
where rais'd up, as well in the country as at
<HI>London,</HI> and the parts adjacent.</P>
<P>ADD to the rents of hou&s;es, the wages of
&s;ervants. A trade&s;man, be he ever &s;o much
inclin'd to good husbandry, cannot always do
his kitchin-work him&s;elf, <HI>&s;uppo&s;e him a batche|lor;</HI>
or can his wife, <HI>&s;uppo&s;e him married,</HI> and
&s;uppo&s;e her to have brought him any portion,
be his bedfellow and his cook too: the&s;e maid-&s;ervants
then are to be con&s;ider'd, and are an
exceeding tax upon hou&s;e-keepers; tho&s;e who
were formerly hired at three pounds to four
pounds a year wages, now demand five, &s;ix, and
eight pounds a year; nor do they double any
thing upon us but their wages and their pride;
for in&s;tead of doing more work for their ad|vance
of wages, <HI>they do le&s;s:</HI> and the ordinary
work of families cannot now be performed by
the &s;ame number of maids, which in &s;hort is a
tax upon the upper &s;ort of trade&s;men, and con|tributes
very often to their di&s;a&s;ters, by the ex|travagant
keeping three pr four maid-&s;ervants
<PB N="140" REF="157">
in a hou&s;e, nay, &s;ometimes five, where two
formerly were thought &s;ufficient. This very
extravagance is &s;uch, that talking, lately with a
man very well experienced in this matter, he
told me he had been making his calculations
on that very particular; and he found by com|putation,
that the number of &s;ervants kept by
all &s;orts of people, trade&s;men as well as others,
was &s;o much encrea&s;ed, that there are in <HI>Lon|don,</HI>
and the towns within ten miles of it,
take it every way, above an hundred thou&s;and
more maid-&s;ervants and footmen, at this time
in place, than u&s;ed to be in the &s;ame compa&s;s
of ground thirty years ago; and that their wages
amounted to above forty &s;hillings a head <HI>per
annum,</HI> more than the wages of the like num|ber
of &s;ervants did amount to at the &s;ame
length of time pa&s;t; the advance to the whole
body amounting to no le&s;s than two hundred
thou&s;and pounds a year.</P>
<P>INDEED it is not ea&s;y to gue&s;s what the ex|pence
of wages to &s;ervants amounts to in a
year, in this nation; and con&s;equently we can|nor
ea&s;ily determine what the encrea&s;e of that
expence amounts to in <HI>England,</HI> but certainly
it mu&s;t ri&s;e to many hundred thou&s;and pounds
a year in the whole.</P>
<P>THE trade&s;men bear their &s;hare of this ex|pence,
and indeed too great a &s;hare, very or|dinary
trade&s;men in <HI>London</HI> keeping at lea&s;t
two maids, and &s;ome more, and &s;ome a foot|man
or two be&s;ides; for 'tis an ordinary thing
to &s;ee the trade&s;men and &s;hop-keepers of <HI>Lon|don</HI>
keep footmen, as well as the gentlemen;
<PB N="141" REF="158">
witne&s;s the infinite number of blue liveries,
which are &s;o common now, that they are cal|led
<HI>the trade&s;mens liveries;</HI> and few gentlemen
care to give blue to their &s;ervants for that very
rea&s;on.</P>
<P>IN proportion to their &s;ervants, the trade&s;men
now keep their tables; which are al&s;o advanced
in their proportion of expence to other things;
indeed the citizens and trade&s;mens tables are
now the emblems, not of plenty, but of luxu|ry,
not of good hou&s;e-keeping, but of profu|&s;ion,
and that of the highe&s;t kind of extrava|gancies;
in&s;omuch, that it was the opinion of
a gentleman who had been not a traveller on|ly,
but a nice ob&s;erver of &s;uch things abroad,
that there is at this time more wa&s;te of provi|&s;ions
in <HI>England,</HI> than in any other nation in
the world, of equal extent of ground; and that
<HI>England con&s;umes</HI> for their whole &s;ub&s;i&s;tence
more fle&s;h than half <HI>Europe</HI> be&s;ides; that the
beggars of <HI>London,</HI> and within ten miles round
it, eat more white bread than the whole king|dom
of <HI>Scotland;</HI> and the like.</P>
<P>BUT this is an ob&s;ervation only, tho' I believe
'tis very ju&s;t; I am bringing it in here only as
an example of the dreadful profu&s;ion of this
age; and how an extravagant way of expen&s;ive
living, perfectly negligent of all degrees of
frugality or good husbandry, is the reigning
vice of the people: I could enlarge upon it, and
very much to the purpo&s;e here, but I &s;hall have
occa&s;ion to &s;peak of it again.</P>
<P>THE trade&s;man, who I am &s;peaking to by
way of direction, will not, I hope, think this
<PB N="142" REF="159">
the way for him to thrive, or find it for his
convenience to fall in with this common
height of living pre&s;ently, in his beginning; if
he comes gradually into it after he has gotten
&s;omething con&s;iderable to lay by, <HI>I &s;ay,</HI> if he
does it then, 'tis early enough, and he may be
&s;aid to be in&s;en&s;ibly drawn into it by the ne|ce&s;&s;ity
of the times; becau&s;e, <HI>for&s;ooth,</HI> 'tis a
receive'd notion, <HI>We mu&s;t be like other folks:</HI> I
&s;ay, if he does fall into it then, when he will
pretend he cannot help it, 'tis better than wor&s;e;
and if he can afford it, well and good; but to
begin thus, to &s;et up at this rate, when he fir&s;t
looks into the world, I can only &s;ay this, he
that begins in &s;uch a manner, 'twill not be
difficult to gue&s;s where he will end: for a
trade&s;man's pride certainly <HI>precedes his de&s;truc|tion,</HI>
and an expen&s;ive living goes <HI>before his
fall.</HI></P>
<P>WE are &s;peaking now to a trade&s;man, who,
'tis &s;uppos'd, mu&s;t live by his bu&s;ine&s;s; a young
man who &s;ets up a &s;hop, or warehou&s;e, and
expects to get money; one that would be a
rich trade&s;man, rather than a poor, fine, gay
man; a grave citizen, not a peacock's feather:
for he that &s;ets up for a <HI>Sir Fopling Flutter,</HI> in|&s;tead
of a <HI>compleat trade&s;man,</HI> is not to be
thought capable of reli&s;hing this di&s;cour&s;e;
neither does this di&s;cour&s;e reli&s;h him; for &s;uch
men &s;eem to be amons; the incurables, and are

<P><PB N="143" REF="160">
TRADE is not a ball, where people appear in
ma&s;que, and act a part to make &s;port; where
they &s;trive to &s;eem what they really are not,
and to think them&s;elves be&s;t dre&s;t when they
are lea&s;t known: but 'tis a plain vi&s;ible &s;cene
of hone&s;t life, &s;hewn be&s;t in its native appear|ance,
without di&s;gui&s;e; &s;upported by prudence
and frugality; and like &s;trong, &s;tiff, clay land, grows
fruitful only by good husbandry, culture and
manuring.</P>
<P>A trade&s;man dre&s;t up fine, with his long wig
and &s;word, may go to the ball when he plea&s;es,
for he is already dre&s;t up in the habit; like a
piece of counterfeit money, he is bra&s;s wa&s;h'd
over with &s;ilver, and no trade&s;man will take
him for current; with: money in his hand, in|deed,
he may go to the merchant's warehou&s;e
and buy any thing, but no body will deal with
him without it: he may write upon his edg'd|hat,
as a certain trade&s;man, after having been
once broke and &s;et up again, <HI>I neither give nor
take credit:</HI> and as others &s;et up in their &s;hops,
<HI>No tru&s;t by retale,</HI> &s;o he may &s;ay, <HI>No tru&s;t by
whole&s;ale.</HI> In &s;hort, thus equip'd, he is truly a
trade&s;man <HI>in ma&s;querade,</HI> and mu&s;t pa&s;s for
&s;uch wherever he is known. How long it may
be before his dre&s;s and he may &s;uit, is not hard
to gue&s;s.</P>
<P>SOME will have it that this expen&s;ive way of
living began among the trade&s;men fir&s;t; <HI>that is
to &s;ay,</HI> among the citizens of <HI>London;</HI> and that
their eager re&s;olv'd per&s;uit of that empty and
meane&s;t kind of pride, call'd imitation, <HI>viz.</HI>
to look like the gentry, and appear above them|&s;elves,
<PB N="144" REF="161">
drew them into it. It has indeed been
a fatal cu&s;tom, but it has been too long a city
vanity; if men of quality; liv'd like them&s;elves,
men of no quality would &s;trive to live, not like
them&s;elves: if tho&s;e had plenty, the&s;e would
have profu&s;ion; if tho&s;e had enough, the&s;e
would have exce&s;s; if tho&s;e had what was good,
the&s;e would have what was rare and exotick;
I mean as to &s;ea&s;on, and con&s;equently dear.
And this is one of the ways that has worn out
&s;o many trade&s;men before their time.</P>
<P>THIS extravagance, where-e're it began, had
its fir&s;t ri&s;e among tho&s;e &s;orts of trade&s;men,
who &s;corning the &s;ociety of their &s;hops and
cu&s;tomers, applyed them&s;elves to rambling to
courts and plays; kept company above them|&s;elves,
and &s;pent their hours in &s;uch company
as lives always above them; this could not but
bring great expence along with it; and that ex|pence
would not be confined to the bare keep|ing
&s;uch company abroad, but &s;oon &s;hew'd it
&s;elf in a living <HI>like them</HI> at home, whether the
trade&s;men could &s;upport it or no.</P>
<P>KEEPING high company <HI>abroad,</HI> certainly
brings on vi&s;itings and high treatings <HI>at home;</HI>
and the&s;e are attended with co&s;tly furniture,
rich clothes, and dainty tables: how the&s;e things
agree with a trade&s;man's income, 'tis ea&s;y to
&s;ugge&s;t; and that in &s;hort, the&s;e mea&s;ures have
&s;ent &s;o many trade&s;men to the <HI>Mint,</HI> and to
the <HI>Fleet,</HI> where I am witne&s;s to it that they
have &s;tll carried on their expen&s;ive living till
they have come at la&s;t to &s;tarving and mi&s;ery;
but have been &s;o u&s;ed to it, they could not a|bate
<PB N="145" REF="162">
it, or at lea&s;t not quite leave it off, though
they wanted the money to pay for it.</P>
<P>NOR is the expen&s;ive dre&s;&s;ing a little tax
upon trade&s;men, as it is now come up to an
exce&s;s not formerly known to trade&s;men; and
tho' it is true that this particularly re&s;pects the
ladies, (for the trade&s;mens wives now claim
that title, as they do by their dre&s;s claim
the appearance,) yet to do ju&s;tice to them,
and not to load the women with the reproach,
as if it was wholly theirs, it mu&s;t be acknow|ledged
the men have their &s;hare in dre&s;s, as
the times go now, tho' <HI>it is true,</HI> not &s;o an|tick
and gay as in former days; but do we not
&s;ee fine wigs, fine holland &s;hirts of &s;ix to &s;even
&s;hillings an ell, and perhaps lac'd al&s;o, all late|ly
brought down to the level of the apron,
and become the common wear of trade&s;men;
nay, I may &s;ay of trade&s;mens apprentices, and
that in &s;uch a manner as was never known in
<HI>England</HI> before.</P>
<P>IF the trade&s;man is thriven, and can &s;upport
this and his credit too, that makes the ca&s;e dif|fer,
tho' even then it cannot be &s;aid to be &s;uit|able;
but for a trade&s;man <HI>to begin thus,</HI> is very
imprudent, becau&s;e the expence of this, as <HI>I
&s;aid before,</HI> dreins the very life-blood of his
trade, taking away his ready money only, and
making no return, but the wor&s;t of return, po|verty
and reproach; and in ca&s;e of mi&s;carriage,
infinite &s;candal and offence.</P>
<P>I am loth to make any part of my writing
a &s;atyr upon the women; nor indeed does the
extravagance either of dre&s;s or hou&s;e-keeping,
<PB N="146" REF="163">
lie all, or always, at the door of the trade&s;|mens
wives; the husband is often the prompter
of it; at lea&s;t he does not let his wife into the
detail of his circum&s;tances, he does not make
her mi&s;tre&s;s of her own condition; but either
flatters her with notions of his wealth, his pro|fits,
and his flouri&s;hing circum&s;tances, and &s;o the
innocent woman &s;pends high and lives great,
believing that &s;he is in a condition to afford it,
and that her husband approves of it; at lea&s;t he
does not offer to retrench or re&s;train her, but
lets her go on, and indeed goes on with her,
to the ruin of both.</P>
<P>I cannot but mention one thing here (tho' I
purpo&s;e to give you one di&s;cour&s;e on that &s;ub|ject
by it &s;elf,) namely, the great and indi&s;pen|&s;ible
obligation there is upon a trade&s;man al|ways
to acquaint his wife with the truth of
his circum&s;tances, and not to let her run on in
ignorance, till &s;he falls with him down the pre|cipice
of an unavoidable ruin; a thing no pru|dent
woman would do, and therefore will ne|ver
take ami&s;s a husband's plainne&s;s in that par|ticular
ca&s;e. But I re&s;erve this to another place,
becau&s;e I am rather directing my di&s;cour&s;e at
this time to the trade&s;man at his beginning,
and, as it may be &s;uppo&s;ed, unmarried.</P>
<P>NEXT to the expen&s;ive dre&s;&s;ing, I place the
expen&s;ive keeping company, as one thing fatal
to a trade&s;man, and which, if he would be a
complete trade&s;man, he &s;hould avoid with the
utmo&s;t diligence. 'Tis an agreeable thing to be
&s;een in good company; for a man to &s;ee him&s;elf
courted and valued, and his company de&s;ired by
<PB N="147" REF="164">
men of fa&s;hion and di&s;tinction, is very plea&s;ing
to any young trade&s;man, and it is really a &s;nare
which a young trade&s;man; if he be a man of
&s;en&s;e, can very hardly re&s;i&s;t: There is in it &s;elf
indeed nothing that can be objected again&s;t, or
is not very agreeable to the nature of man, and
that not to his vicious part merely, but even to
his be&s;t faculties; for who would not value
him&s;elf upon being, <HI>as above,</HI> rendred accepta|ble
to men both in &s;tation and figure above
them&s;elves? and it is really a piece of excellent
advice, which a learned man gave to his &s;on,
always to keep company with men above him|&s;elf,
not with men below him&s;elf.</P>
<P>BUT take me now to be talking, as I really
am, not to the man merely, but to his circum|&s;tances;
if he were a man of fortune, and had
the view of great things before him, it would
hold good; but if he is a young trade&s;man,
&s;uch as I am now &s;peaking of, who is newly
entred into bu&s;ine&s;s, and mu&s;t depend upon his
&s;aid bu&s;ine&s;s for his &s;ub&s;i&s;tence and &s;upport,
and hopes to rai&s;e him&s;elf by it; I &s;ay, if I am
talking to &s;uch an one, I mu&s;t &s;ay to him, that
keeping company as above, with men &s;uperior
to him&s;elf in knowledge, in figure, and e&s;tate,
is not his bu&s;ine&s;s; for <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> as &s;uch conver&s;a|tion
mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily take up a great, deal of
his time, &s;o it ordinarily mu&s;t occa&s;ion a great
expence of money, and both de&s;tructive of his
pro&s;perity; nay, &s;ometimes the fir&s;t may be as
fatal to him as the la&s;t; and 'tis oftentimes true
in that &s;en&s;e, of trade, that while by keeping
company he is drawn out of his bu&s;ine&s;s, his
<PB N="148" REF="165">
ab&s;ence from his &s;hop or warehou&s;e is the mo&s;t
fatal to him; and while he &s;pends one crown
in the tavern, he &s;pends forty crowns worth of
his time; and with this difference too, which ren|ders
it the wor&s;e to the trade&s;man, <HI>viz.</HI> that the
money may be recovered, and gotten up again,
but the time cannot. <HI>For example,</HI></P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. PERHAPS in that very juncture a per&s;on
comes to his warehou&s;e, &s;uuppo&s;e the trade&s;man
to be a warehou&s;ekeeper, who trades by com|mi&s;&s;ion,
and this per&s;on, being a clothier in the
country, comes to offer him his bu&s;ine&s;s, the
commi&s;&s;ion of which might have been worth
to him 30 to 40 or 50 <HI>l. per annum,</HI> but finding
him abroad, or rather, not finding him at home
and in his bu&s;ine&s;s, goes to another, and fixes
with him at once. I once knew a dealer lo&s;e
&s;uch an occa&s;ion as this for an afternoon's plea|&s;ure,
he being gone a fi&s;hing into <HI>Hackney|mar&s;h.</HI>
This lo&s;s can never be re&s;tor'd; this
expence of time was a fatal expence of money;
and no trade&s;men will deny but they find ma|ny
&s;uch things as this happen in the cour&s;e of
trade, either to them&s;elves, or others.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. ANOTHER trade&s;man is invited to dinner <HI>by
his great friend;</HI> for I am now &s;peaking chiefly
upon the &s;ubject of keeping high company, and
what the trade&s;man &s;ometimes &s;uffers by it; it
is true, that there he finds a mo&s;t noble enter|tainment,
the per&s;on of quality, and that pro|fe&s;&s;es
a friend&s;hip for him, treats him with infi|nite
re&s;pect, is fond of him, makes him wel|come
as a prince; for I am &s;peaking of the
acquaintance as really valuable and good in it
<PB N="149" REF="166">
&s;elf; but then, &s;ee it in its con&s;equences; the
trade&s;man on this occa&s;ion <HI>mi&s;&s;es his Change;</HI>
that is, omits going to the <HI>Exchange</HI> for that
one day only, and not being found there, a
merchant with whom he was in treaty for a large
parcel of foreign goods, which would have
been to his advantage to have bought, &s;ells
them to another <HI>more diligent</HI> man in the &s;ame
way; and when he comes home, he finds to
his great mortification, that he has lo&s;t a bar|gain
that would have been worth an 100 <HI>l.</HI> buy|ing;
and now being in want of the goods, he
is forced to entreat his neighbour who bought
them to part with &s;ome of them at a con&s;ide|rable
advance of price, and e&s;teem it a favour
too. Who now paid deare&s;t for the vi&s;it to a
per&s;on of figure? the gentleman, who perhaps
&s;pent twenty &s;hillings extraordinary to give him
a hand&s;ome dinner, or the trade&s;man who lo&s;t
a bargain worth a hundred pound buying to go
to eat it?</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. ANOTHER trade&s;man goes to <HI>Change</HI> in
the ordinary cour&s;e of his bu&s;ine&s;s, intending to
&s;peak with &s;ome of the merchants his cu&s;tomers,
as is u&s;ual, and get orders for goods, or per|haps
an appointment to come to his warehouse
to buy; but a &s;nare of the like kind falls in
his way, and a couple of friends, who perhaps
have little or no bu&s;ine&s;s, <HI>at lea&s;t with him,</HI>
lay hold of him, and they agree to go off
<HI>Change</HI> to the tavern together. By complying
with this invitation, he omits &s;peaking to &s;ome
of tho&s;e merchants, as above, who though he
knew nothing of their minds, yet it had been
<PB N="150" REF="167">
his bu&s;ine&s;s to have &s;hewn him&s;elf to them, and
have put him&s;elf in the way of their call; but
omitting this, he goes and drinks a bottle of
wine, <HI>as above,</HI> and tho' he &s;tays but an hour,
or, as we &s;ay, but a little while, yet unluckily
in that interim, the merchant, not &s;eeing him
on the <HI>Exchange,</HI> calls at his warehou&s;e as he
goes from the <HI>Exchange,</HI> but not finding him
there neither, he goes to another warehou&s;e,
and gives his orders to the value of three or
four hundred pounds, to a more diligent neigh|bour
of the &s;ame bu&s;ine&s;s; by which he (the
warehou&s;e-keeper) not only lo&s;es the profit of
&s;elling that parcel, or &s;erving that order, but the
merchant is &s;hew'd the way to his neigh|bour's
warehou&s;e, who being more diligent than
him&s;elf, fails not to cultivate his intere&s;t, ob|liges
him with &s;elling low, even to little or no
gain, for the fir&s;t parcel; and &s;o the unhappy
trade&s;man lo&s;es not his &s;elling that parcel on|ly,
but lo&s;es the very cu&s;tomer, which was as
it were his peculiar property before.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>ALL the&s;e things, and many more &s;uch, are
the con&s;equences of a trade&s;man's ab&s;ence from
his bu&s;ine&s;s; and I therefore &s;ay, the expence
of time on &s;uch light occa&s;ions as the&s;e, is one
of the wor&s;t &s;orts of extravagance, and the mo&s;t
fatal to the trade&s;man, becau&s;e really he knows
not what he lo&s;es.</P>
<P>ABOVE all things, the trade&s;man &s;hould take
care not to be ab&s;ent in the &s;ea&s;on of bu&s;ine&s;s,
as I have mention'd above; for the warehou&s;e-keeper
to be ab&s;ent from <HI>Change,</HI> which is his
market, or from his warehou&s;e, at the times
<PB N="151" REF="168">
when the merchants generally go about to buy,
he had better be ab&s;ent all the re&s;t of the day.</P>
<P>I know nothing is more frequent, than for
the trade&s;man, when company invites, or an
excur&s;ion from bu&s;ine&s;s pre&s;&s;es, to &s;ay, Well,
come, I have nothing to do, here's no bu&s;ine&s;s
to hinder, there's nothing neglected, I have no
letters to write, and the like; and away he
goes to take the air for the afternoon, or to
&s;it and enjoy him&s;elf with a friend, all of them
things innocent and lawful in them&s;elves; but
here is the cri&s;is of a trade&s;man's prosperity, in
that very moment bu&s;ine&s;s pre&s;ents, a valuable
cu&s;tomer comes to buy, an unexpected bargain
offers to be &s;old, another calls to pay money,
<HI>and the like;</HI> nay, I would almo&s;t &s;ay, but that
I am loth to concern the <HI>devil</HI> in more evils
than he is guilty of, that <HI>the devil</HI> frequently
draws a man out of his bu&s;ine&s;s when &s;ome|thing
extraordinary, is ju&s;t at hand for his ad|vantage.</P>
<P>BUT not, <HI>as I have &s;aid,</HI> to charge the <HI>de|vil</HI>
with what he is not guilty of, the trade&s;|man
is generally his own tempter; his head
runs off from his bu&s;ine&s;s by a &s;ecret indolence;
company, and the plea&s;ure of being well receiv'd
among gentlemen, is a cur&s;ed &s;nare to a young
trade&s;man, and carries him away from his bu|&s;ine&s;s,
for the mere vanity of being care&s;s'd
and complimented by men who mean no
ill, and perhaps know not the mi&s;chief they
do to the man they &s;hew re&s;pect to; and this
the young trade&s;man cannot re&s;i&s;t, and that is
in time his undoing.</P>
<P><PB N="152" REF="169">
THE trade&s;man's plea&s;ure &s;hould be in his
bu&s;ine&s;s, his companions &s;hould be his books,
and if he has a family, <HI>he makes his excur&s;ions
up &s;tairs, and no farther;</HI> when he is there, a
bell or a call brings him down; and while he is
in his parlour, his &s;hop or his warehou&s;e never
mi&s;&s;es him; his cu&s;tomers never go away un|&s;erv'd,
his letters never come in and are unan|&s;wer'd.
None of my cautions aim at re&s;train|ing
a trade&s;man from diverting him&s;elf, as we
call it, with his fire-&s;ide, or keeping company
with his wife and children: there are &s;o few
trade&s;men ruin them&s;elves that way, and &s;o few
ill consequences happen upon an uxorious temper,
that I will not &s;o much as rank it with
the re&s;t; nor can it be, ju&s;tly call'd one of the
occa&s;ions of a trade&s;man's di&s;a&s;ters; on the con|trary,
'tis too often that the want of a due com|placency
there, the want of taking delight there,
e&s;tranges the man from not his parlour on|ly,
but his warehou&s;e and &s;hop, and every part
of bu&s;ine&s;s, that ought to engro&s;s both his mind
and his time. That trade&s;man who does not
delight in his family, will never long delight in
his bu&s;ine&s;s; for as one great end of an hone&s;t
trade&s;man's diligence is the &s;upport of his fa|mily,
and the providing for the comfortable &s;ub|&s;i&s;tence
of his wife and children; &s;o the very
&s;ight of, and above all, his tender and affec|tionate
care for his wife and children, is the
&s;pur of his diligence; this is it puts an edge
upon his mind, and makes him hunt the world
for bui&s;ne&s;s, as hounds hunt the woods for their
game: when he is di&s;pirited, or di&s;couraged
<PB N="153" REF="170">
by cro&s;&s;es and di&s;appointments, and ready to lie
down and de&s;pair, the very &s;ight of his family
rouzes him again, and he flies to his bu&s;ine&s;s
with a new vigour; I mu&s;t follow my bu&s;ine&s;s,
&s;ays he, or we mu&s;t all &s;tarve, my poor child|ren
mu&s;t peri&s;h; in a word, he that is not ani|mated
to diligence by the very &s;ight and thought
of his wife and children being brought to mi|sery
and di&s;tre&s;s, is a kind of a deaf adder that
no mu&s;ic will charm, or a <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> mute that no
pity can move: in a word, he is a creature not
to be call'd human, a wretch harden'd again&s;t all
the pa&s;&s;ions and affections that nature has fur|ni&s;h'd
to other animals; and as there is no rhe|torick
of u&s;e to &s;uch a kind of man as that, &s;o
I am not talking to &s;uch an one, he mu&s;t go

would bring with it, and the care he ought to
take to be able to &s;upport the expence before
he brought it upon him&s;elf.</P>
<P><PB N="155" REF="172">
On this account it is, I &s;ay, our ance&s;tors took
more care of their youth than we now do, at|lea&s;t,
I think, they &s;tudied well the be&s;t methods
of thriving and were better acquainted with
the &s;teps by which a young trade&s;man ought to
be introduc'd into the world than we are, and
of the difficulties which tho&s;e people would ne|ce&s;&s;arily
involve them&s;elves in, who de&s;pi&s;ing;
tho&s;e rules and methods of frugality, involv'd
them&s;elves in the expence of a family before
they were in a way of gaining &s;ufficient to &s;up|port
it.</P>
<P>A married apprentice will always make a re|penting
trade&s;man, and tho&s;e &s;tolen matches,
<HI>a very few excepted,</HI> are generally attended with
infinite broils and troubles, difficulties, and cro&s;s
events to carry them on at fir&s;t by way of in|triegue,
to conceal them afterward under fear
of &s;uperiours, to manage after that to keep off
&s;candal, and pre&s;erve the character as well of
the wi&s;e as of the husband; and all this nece&s;|&s;arily
attended with a heavy expence, even be|fore
the young man is out of his time; before
he has &s;et a foot forward, or gotten a &s;hilling
in the world; &s;o that all this expence is out of
his original &s;tock, even before he gets it, and is
a &s;ad draw-back upon him when it comes.</P>
<P>Nay, this unhappy and dirty part is often at|tended
with wor&s;e consequences &s;till; for this
expence coming upon him while he is but a &s;er|vant,
and While his portion, <HI>or whatever it is
to be called,</HI> is not yet come into his hand, he
is driven to terrible exigences to &s;upply this ex|pence;
If his circum&s;tances are mean, and his
<PB N="156" REF="173">
trade mean, he is frequently driven to wrong
his ma&s;ter, and rob his &s;hop, or his TILL for
money, if he can come at it; and this, as it
begins in madne&s;s, generally ends in de&s;tructi|on;
for often he is di&s;cover'd, expos'd, and per|haps
puni&s;h'd, and &s;o the man is undone be|fore
he begins: if his circum&s;tances are good,
and he has friends that are able, and expecta|tions
that are con&s;iderable, then his expence is
&s;till the greater; and ways and means are found
out, or at lea&s;t look'd for to &s;upply the expence,
and conceal the fact, that his friends may not
know of it, 'till he has gotten the ble&s;&s;ing he
expects into his hands, and is put in a way to
&s;tand upon his own legs; and then it comes
out with a great many grieving aggravations to
a parent to find him&s;elf trick'd and defeated in
the expectations of his &s;on's marrying hand&s;omly,
and to his advantage; in&s;tead of which he is
obliged, to receive a di&s;hclout for a daughter in
law, and &s;ee his family propagated by a race of
beggars, and yet perhaps as haughty, as in&s;olent,
and as expen&s;ive, as if &s;he had ble&s;s'd the family
with a lady of fortune, and brought a fund
with her to have &s;upported the charge of her
po&s;terity.</P>
<P>WHEN this happens, the poor young man's
ca&s;e is really deplorable: before he is out of his
time, and while he nouri&s;hes his new &s;pou&s;e in
the dark, he is obliged to borrow of friends, <HI>if
he has any,</HI> on pretence his father does not
make him a &s;ufficient allowance, or he entrench|es
upon his ma&s;ter's ca&s;h, which perhaps, <HI>he
being the elde&s;t apprentice,</HI> is in his hands; and
<PB N="157" REF="174">
this he does, depending that when he is out of his time,
and his father gives him wherewith to
&s;et up, he will make good the deficiency, and
all this happens accordingly; &s;o that his repu|tation
as to his ma&s;ter is pre&s;erv'd, and he comes
off clear as to di&s;hone&s;ty in his tru&s;t.</P>
<P>BUT what a &s;ad cha&s;m does it make in his
fortune! I knew a certain young trade&s;man,
who&s;e father knowing nothing of his &s;on's mea|&s;ures,
gave him 2000 <HI>l.</HI> to &s;et up with, &s;train|ing
him&s;elf to the utmo&s;t for the well intro|ducing
his &s;on into the world; but who, when
he came to &s;et up, having near a year before
married the &s;ervant-maid of the hou&s;e, and kept
her privately at a great expence, had above &s;ix
hundred pounds of his &s;tock already wa&s;ted and
&s;unk, before he began, for him&s;elf; the con&s;e|quence
of which was, that going in partner with
another young man, who had likewi&s;e
2000 <HI>l.</HI> to begin with, he was, in&s;tead of a half
of the profits, obliged to make a private article
to accept of a third of the trade; and the beg|gar
wife proving more expen&s;ive by far than the
partner's wife (who married afterwards, and dou|bled
his fortune) the fir&s;t young man was obliged
to quit the trade, and with his remaining &s;tock
&s;et up by him&s;elf; in which ca&s;e his expences
continuing, and his &s;tock being in&s;ufficient, he
&s;unk gradually, and then broke, and died poor:
in a word, he broke the heart of his father,
wa&s;ted what he had, and could never recover it,
and at la&s;t it broke his own heart too.</P>
<P>BUT I &s;hall bring it a little farther. Suppo&s;e
the youth not to act &s;o gro&s;ly neither; not to
<PB N="158" REF="175">
marry in his apprentice&s;hip, not to be forced to
keep a wife in the dark, and eat the bread he
never got; but &s;uppo&s;e him to be entred upon
the world, that he has &s;et up, open'd &s;hop, or
fitted up his warehouse, and he is ready to trade;
the next thing in the ordinary cour&s;e of the
world at this time is <HI>a wi&s;e;</HI> nay, I have met
with &s;ome parents, who have been indi&s;creet
enough them&s;elves to prompt their &s;ons to mar|ry
as &s;oon as they are &s;et up; and the rea&s;on
they give for it is, the wickedne&s;s of the age,
that youth are drawn in a hundred ways to ru|inous
matches or debaucheries, and are &s;o ea&s;ily
ruin'd by the meer loo&s;ene&s;s of their circum|&s;tances,
that 'tis needful to marry them to
keep them at home, and to pre&s;erve them dili|gent,
and bind them clo&s;e to their bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>THIS, be it ju&s;t or not, is a bad cure of an
ill di&s;ea&s;e; it is ruining the young man to make
him &s;ober, and making him a &s;lave for life to
make him diligent; be it that the wife he &s;hall
marry is a &s;ober, frugal, hou&s;ewifely woman,
and that nothing is to be laid to her charge but
the meer nece&s;&s;ary addition of a family expence,
and that with the utmo&s;t moderation; yet at
the be&s;t he cripples his fortune, <HI>&s;tock-&s;tarves his
bu&s;ine&s;s,</HI> and brings a great expence upon him|&s;elf
at fir&s;t, before by his &s;ucce&s;s in trade he had
laid up &s;tock enough to &s;upport the charge.</P>
<P>FIRST, it is rea&s;onable to &s;uppo&s;e that that at his
beginning in the world he cannot expect to get
&s;o good a portion with a wife, as he might af|ter
he had been &s;et up a few years, and by his
diligence and frugality join'd to a &s;mall expence
<PB N="159" REF="176">
in hou&s;e-keeping had increas'd both his &s;tock in
trade, and the trade it&s;elf; then he would be
able ro look forward boldly, and would have
&s;ome pretence for in&s;i&s;ting on a fortune, when
he could make out his improvements in trade,
and &s;hew, that he was both able to maintain a
wife, and able to live without her: when a
young trade&s;man in <HI>Holland</HI> or <HI>Germany</HI> goes
a courting, I am told, the fir&s;t que&s;tion the
young woman asks of him, or perhaps her friends
for her is, <HI>Are you able to pay the charges?</HI>
that is to &s;ay in <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> Are you able to keep
a wife when you have got her? the que&s;tion is
a little <HI>Gothick</HI> indeed, and would be but a
kind of gro&s;s way of receiving a lover here, ac|cording
to our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> good breeding; but
there is a great deal of rea&s;on in the enquiry,
<HI>that mu&s;t he confe&s;s'd;</HI> and he that is not able
to <HI>pay the charges,</HI> &s;hould never begin the jour|ney;
for be the wife what &s;he will, the very &s;tate
of life, that naturally attends the marrying a
woman, brings with it an expence &s;o very con|&s;iderable,
that a trade&s;man ought, to con&s;ider
very well of it before he engages.</P>
<P>BUT it is to be ob&s;erv'd too, that abundance
of young trade&s;men, e&s;pecially in <HI>England,</HI>
not only marry early, but by the &s;o marrying
they are obliged to take up with much le&s;s for|tunes
in their ha&s;te, than when they allow them|&s;elves
longer time of con&s;ideration; as it &s;tands
now, generally &s;peaking, the wife and the &s;hop
make their fir&s;t &s;hew together; but how
few of the&s;e early marriages &s;ucceed? how hard
&s;uch a trade&s;man finds it to &s;tand, and &s;upport
<PB N="160" REF="177">
the weight that attends it, I appeal to the expe|rience
of tho&s;e, who having taken this wrong
&s;tep, and being with difficulty got over it, are
yet good judges of that particular circum&s;tance
in others that come after them.</P>
<P>I know 'tis a common cry that is rais'd a|gain&s;t
the woman, when her husband mi&s;carries,
namely, that 'tis the wife has ruin'd him: it is
true, in &s;ome particular ca&s;es it may be &s;o, but
in general 'tis wrong placed; they may &s;ay mar|rying
has ruin'd the man, when they cannot
&s;ay his wife has done it; for the woman was
not in fault, but her husband.</P>
<P>WHEN a trade&s;man marries, there are nece&s;|&s;ary
con&s;equences, I mean of expences, which
the wife ought not be charg'd with, and cannot
be made accountable for; &s;uch as, <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> furni&s;h|ing
the hou&s;e; and let this be done with the
utmo&s;t plainne&s;s, &s;o as to be decent, yet it mu&s;t
be done; and this calls for ready money, and
that ready money by &s;o much dimini&s;hes his &s;tock
in trade; nor is the wife at all to be charg'd in
this ca&s;e, unle&s;s &s;he either put him to more
charge than was needful, or &s;hew'd her&s;elf di&s;|&s;atisfy'd
with things needful, and requir'd extra|vagant
gaiety and expence: <HI>&s;econdly, &s;ervants;</HI>
if the man was frugal before, it may be he &s;hift|ed
with a &s;hop, and a &s;ervant in it, an appren|tice,
or journeyman, or perhaps without one at
fir&s;t, and a lodging for him&s;elf, where he kept
no other &s;ervant, and &s;o his expences went on
&s;mall and ea&s;y; or, if he was obliged to take
a hou&s;e becau&s;e of his bu&s;ine&s;s and the &s;ituation
of his &s;hop, he then either let part of the hou&s;e
<PB N="161" REF="178">
out to lodgers, keeping him&s;elf a chamber in it
or at the wor&s;t le&s;t it unfurni&s;h'd, and without
any one but a maid-&s;ervant to dre&s;s his victuals,
and keep the hou&s;e clean; and thus he goes on
when a batchelor, with a middling expence at
mo&s;t.</P>
<P>BUT when he brings home a wife, be&s;ides the
furni&s;hing his hou&s;e, he mu&s;t have a formal
hou&s;e-keeping, even, at the very fir&s;t; and,
as children come on, more &s;ervants, that is, maids or
nur&s;es, that are as nece&s;&s;ary as the bread he eats;
e&s;pecially if he multiplies apace, as he ought
to &s;uppo&s;e he may; in this ca&s;e let the wife be
frugal and managing, let her be unexceptionable
in her expence, yet the man finds his charge
mount high, and perhaps too high for his get|tings,
notwith&s;tanding the additional &s;tock ob|tain'd
by her portion; and what is the end of
this but inevitable decay, and at la&s;t poverty and
ruin?</P>
<P>NAY the more the woman is blamele&s;s, the
more certain is his overthrow; for if it was an
expence that was extravagant and unnece&s;&s;ary,
and that his wife ran him out by her high liv|ing
and gaiety, he might find ways to retrench,
to take up in time, and prevent the mi&s;chiet
that is in view; a woman may with kindne&s;s
and ju&s;t rea&s;oning be ea&s;ily convinced, that her
husband cannot maintain &s;uch an expence, as
&s;he now lives at; and let trade&s;men &s;ay what
they will, and endeavour to excu&s;e them&s;elves
as much as they will, by loading their wives
with the blame of their mi&s;carriage, as I have
known &s;ome do, and as old father ADAM,
<PB N="162" REF="179">
<HI>tho' in another ca&s;e,</HI> did before them, I mu&s;t
&s;ay &s;o much in the woman's behalf at a ven|ture;
it will be very hard to make me believe
that any woman, that was not fit for <HI>Bedlam,</HI>
if her husband truly and timely repre&s;ented his
ca&s;e to her, and how far he was or was not a|ble
to maintain the expence of their way of
living, would not comply with her husband's
circum&s;tances, and retrench her expences, ra|ther
than go on for a while, and come to po|verty
and mi&s;ery: Let then the trade&s;man lay
it early and &s;eriou&s;ly before his wife and with
kindne&s;s and plainne&s;s tell her his circum&s;tan|ces,
or never let him pretend to charge her with
being the cau&s;e of his ruin; let him tell her
how great his annual expence is; for a woman
who receives what &s;he wants as &s;he wants it, that
only takes it with one hand, and lays it out with
another, does not, and perhaps cannot, always
keep an account, or ca&s;t up how much it comes
to by the year; let her husband therefore, I &s;ay,
tell her hone&s;tly how much his expence for her
and him&s;elf amounts to yearly; and tell her as
hone&s;tly, that it is too much for him, that his
income in trade will not an&s;wer it; that he
goes backward, and the la&s;t year his family ex|pences
amounted to &s;o much, &s;ay 400 <HI>l.</HI> (for
that is but an ordinary &s;um now for a trade&s;man
to &s;pend, whatever it has been e&s;teem'd former|ly)
and that his whole trade, tho' he made no
bad debts, and had no lo&s;&s;es, brought him in
but 320 <HI>l.</HI> the whole year, &s;o that he was 80 <HI>l.</HI>
that year a wor&s;e man than he was before; that
this coming year he had met with a heavy lo&s;s
<PB N="163" REF="180">
already, having had a &s;hop-keeper in the coun|try
broke in his debt 200 <HI>l.</HI> and that he offer'd
but eight &s;hillings in the pound, &s;o that he &s;hould
lo&s;e 120 <HI>l.</HI> by him, and that this added to the
80 <HI>l.</HI> run out la&s;t year came to 200 <HI>l.</HI> and that
if they went on thus, they &s;hould be &s;oon re|duc'd.</P>
<P>WHAT could the woman &s;ay to &s;o rea&s;onable
a di&s;cour&s;e, if &s;he was a woman of any &s;en&s;e,
<HI>but to reply,</HI> &s;he would do any thing that lay in
her to a&s;&s;i&s;t him, and if her way of living was
too great for him to &s;upport, &s;he would le&s;&s;en
it as he &s;hould direct, or as much as he thought
was rea&s;onable? and thus going hand in hand,
&s;he and he together abating what rea&s;on requir'd,
they might bring their expences within the com|pa&s;
of their gettings, and be able to go on a|gain
comfortably.</P>
<P>BUT now, when the man finding his expences
greater than his income, and yet when he looks
into tho&s;e expences finds that his wife is frugal
too, and indu&s;trious, and applies diligently to
the managing her family, and bringing up her
children, &s;pends nothing idly, &s;aves every thing
that can be &s;av'd, that in&s;tead of keeping too
many &s;ervants is a &s;ervant to every body her
&s;elf; and that in &s;hort, when he makes the &s;trict|e&s;t
examination, finds &s;he lays out nothing but
what is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, what now mu&s;t this
man do? he is ruin'd inevitably; for all his ex|pence
is nece&s;&s;ary, there is no retrenching, no
abating any thing.</P>
<P>THIS I &s;ay is the wor&s;t ca&s;e of the two in|deed;
and this man, tho' he may &s;ay he is un|done
<PB N="164" REF="181">
done by marrying, yet cannot blame the wo|man,
and &s;ay he is undone by his wife: This is
the very ca&s;e I am &s;peaking of; the man &s;hould
not have married &s;o &s;oon, he &s;hould have &s;taid
'till he had, by pu&s;hing on his trade and living
clo&s;e in his expence, encrea&s;ed his &s;tock, and
been what we call before-hand in the world;
and had he done thus, he had not been undone
by marrying.</P>
<P>IT is a little hard to &s;ay it, but in this re&s;pect
it is very true, there is many a young trade&s;man
ruined by marrying a good wife: in which pray
take notice that I ob&s;erve my own ju&s;t di&s;tincti|on;
I do not &s;ay they are ruin'd or undone by
a good wife, or by their wives being good, but
by their marrying, their un&s;ea&s;onable, early, and
ha&s;ty marrying, before they had ca&s;t up the co&s;t
of one, or the income of the other; before they
had enquir'd into the nece&s;&s;ary charge of a wife
and a family, or &s;een the profits of their bu&s;i|ne&s;s,
whether it would maintain them, or no;
and whether, as above, they could pay the
charges, the encrea&s;ing nece&s;&s;ary charge of a
large and growing family. How to per&s;uade
young men to con&s;ider this in time, and beware
and avoid the mi&s;chief of it, that is a que&s;tion
by itfelf.</P>
<P>LET no man then, when he is brought to di|&s;tre&s;s
by this early ra&s;hne&s;s, turn &s;hort upon his
wife, and reproach her with being the cau&s;e of
his ruin; unle&s;s at the &s;ame time he can charge
her with extravagant living, needle&s;s expence,
&s;quandring away his money, &s;pending it in tri|fles
and toys, and running him out 'till the &s;hop
<PB N="165" REF="182">
could not maintain, the kitchen, much le&s;s the
parlour; nor even then, unle&s;s he had given
her timely notice of it, and warn'd her that he
was not able to maintain &s;o large a family, or
&s;o great an expence; and that therefore &s;he
would do well to con&s;ider of it, and manage
with a &s;traighter hand, and the like; If indeed
he had done &s;o, and &s;he had not comply'd with
him, then &s;he had been guilty, and without ex|cu&s;e
too; but as the woman cannot judge of his
affairs, and he &s;ees and bears a &s;hare in the riot|ous
way of their living, and does not either &s;hew
his di&s;like of it, or let her know by &s;ome means
or other that he cannot &s;upport it, the woman
cannot be charg'd with being his ruin, no tho'
her way of extravagant expen&s;ive living were re|ally
the cau&s;e of it: I met with a &s;hort dialogue
the other day between a trade&s;man and his wife
upon &s;uch a &s;ubject as this, &s;ome part of which
may be in&s;tructing in the ca&s;e before us.</P>
<P>THE trade&s;man was very melancholy for two
or three days, and had appear'd all that time to
be pen&s;ive and &s;ad, and his wife with all her
arts, entreaties, anger, tears, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> could not get
it out of him; only now and then &s;he heard
him fetch a deep &s;igh, and at another time &s;ay
<HI>he wi&s;h'd he was dead,</HI> and the like expre&s;&s;ions:
At la&s;t &s;he began the di&s;cour&s;e with him in a
re&s;pectful, obliging manner, but with the utmo&s;t
importunity to get it out of him thus:</P>

a &s;udden he was arre&s;ted in an action for a great

the next day an execution on another action
was &s;erv'd in the hou&s;e, and &s;wept away the

would break his heart, and the like; and now
he has broke her heart.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wife.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>But!</HI> but what? was there really a
true kindne&s;s and affection, as is the pretence,
it would be quite otherwi&s;e; he would not break
his own heart for&s;ooth, but cho&s;e rather to break
his wife's heart! he could not be &s;o cruel to
tell her of it, and therefore left her to be cru|elly
and villainou&s;ly in&s;ulted, as &s;he was, by
the bailiffs and creditors; was that his kindne&s;s

<SP>

<P>Yes, yes, there's no body knows what
they can do 'till they are tried: two maids may
do all my hou&s;e-bu&s;ine&s;s, and I'll look after my

a little bigger, I'll make them help one another,

make it &s;o.</P>

would not have you &s;treighten your&s;elf too much
neither.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>NAY, this will not be &s;o much a mor|tification,
as the natural con&s;equence of other
things, for in order to abate the expence of
our living, I re&s;olve to keep le&s;s company; I
a&s;&s;ure you I will lay down all the &s;tate of liv|ing;

as well as the expence of it; and fir&s;t, I
will keep no vi&s;iting days; &s;econdly, I'll drop
the greate&s;t part of the acquaintance I have;
thirdly, I will lay down our treats, and enter|tainments,
and the like needle&s;s occa&s;ions of
expence, and then I &s;hall have no occa&s;ion for &s;o
many maids.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Husb.</SPEAKER>
<P>BUT this, <HI>my Dear,</HI> I &s;ay, will make

<SP>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Husb.</SPEAKER>

<P>IT is &s;ad work to come down hill
thus.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wife.</SPEAKER>
<P>'TWOULD be wor&s;e to fall down at one
blow from the top; better &s;lide gently and vo|luntarily
down the &s;mooth part, than to be pu&s;h'd
down the precipice, and be da&s;h'd all in pieces.</P>
</SP>
<P><HI>THERE</HI> was more of this dialogue, but I
give you the part which I think mo&s;t to the
pre&s;ent purpo&s;es; and as I &s;trive to &s;horten the
doctrine, &s;o I will abridge the application al&s;o;
the &s;ub&s;tance of the ca&s;e lies in a few particu|lars
thus;</P>
<P>I. THE man was melancholy, and oppre&s;s'd
with the thoughts of his declining circum&s;tan|ces,
and yet had not any thought of letting
<PB N="175" REF="194">
his wife know it, who&s;e way of living was high
and expen&s;ive, and more than he could &s;upport;
but tho` it mu&s;t have ended in ruin, he would
rather let it have gone on 'till &s;he was &s;urpri&s;ed
in it, than to tell her the danger that was before
her.</P>
<Q>HIS wife very well argues the inju&s;tice and
unkindne&s;s of &s;uch u&s;age, and how hard
it was to a wife, who being of nece&s;&s;ity
to &s;uffer in the fall, ought certainly to have
the mo&s;t early notice of it; that if po&s;&s;ible
&s;he might prevent it, or at lea&s;t that &s;he
might not be overwhelmed with the &s;ud|denne&s;s
and the terror of it.</Q>
<P>II. UPON di&s;covering it to his wife, or ra|ther
her drawing the di&s;covery from him by
her importunity, the immediately, and mo&s;t rea|dily
and chearfully, enters into mea&s;ures to re|trench
her expences, and, as far as &s;he was able,
to prevent the blow, which was otherwi&s;e ap|parent
and unavoidable.</P>
<Q>HENCE 'tis apparent, that the expen&s;ive living
of mo&s;t trade&s;men in their families, is for
want of a &s;erious acquainting their wives
with their circum&s;tances, and acquainting
them al&s;o <HI>in time;</HI> for there are very few
of the ladies &s;o unrea&s;onable, who, if their
husbands &s;eriou&s;ly inform'd them how
things &s;tood with them, and that they could
not &s;upport their way of living, would not
<PB N="176" REF="195">
willingly come into mea&s;ures to prevent
their own de&s;truction.</Q>
<P>III. THAT 'tis in vain, as well as unequal, for a
trade&s;man to preach frugality to his wife, and
to bring his wife to a retrenching of her expen|ces,
and not at the &s;ame time to retrench his
own; &s;eeing that keeping hor&s;es and high com|pany
is every way as great and expen&s;ive, and
as nece&s;&s;ary to be abated as any of the family
extravagances, let them be which they will.</P>
<P>ALL, this relates to the duty of a trade&s;man
in preventing his family-expences being ruinous
to his bu&s;ine&s;s; but the true method to prevent
all this, and never to let it come &s;o far, is &s;till,
as I &s;aid before, not to marry too &s;oon; not to
marry, 'till by a frugal indu&s;trious management
of his trade in the beginning, he has laid a foun|dation
for maintaining a wife, and bringing up
a family, and has made an e&s;&s;ay by which he
knows what he can, and cannot do; and al&s;o
before he has laid up and encrea&s;ed his &s;tock,
that he may not cripple his fortune at fir&s;t, and
be ruin'd before he has begun to thrive.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_IT is the ordinary excu&s;e of the gentlemen
trade&s;men of our times, that they have
good &s;ervants; and that therefore they take
more liberty - to be out of their bu&s;ine&s;s,
than they would otherwi&s;e do: <HI>O! &s;ays the
&s;hopkeeper,</HI> I have an apprentice, 'tis an e&s;tate
to have: &s;uch a &s;ervant; I am as &s;afe in him as
if I had my eye upon the bu&s;ine&s;s from morn|ing
to night; let me be where I will, I am al|ways
&s;atisfied he is at home; if I am at the tavern,
I am &s;ure he is in the compting-hou&s;e, or be|hind
the counter; he is never out of his po&s;t.</P>

apprentices, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> 'tis all one as if I were
there my&s;elf; they would be idle it may be,
but he won't let them I a&s;&s;ure you; they mu&s;t
&s;tick clo&s;e to it, or he will make them do it; he
tells them, boys do not come apprentices to play,
but to work; not to &s;it idle, and be doing no|thing,
but to mind their ma&s;ter's bu&s;ine&s;s, that
they may learn how to do their own.</P>
<P>VERY well; and <HI>you think, Sir,</HI> this young
man being &s;o much in the &s;hop, and &s;o diligent

pleas'd with him, as they would be, if you were
there your&s;elf.</P>
<P>YES, they are, &s;ays the &s;hop-keeper; nay, abun|dance
of the cu&s;tomers take him for the ma&s;ter
of the &s;hop, and don't know any other; and
he is &s;o very obliging, and plea&s;es &s;o well, giv|ing
content to every body, that if I am at any
other part of the &s;hop, and &s;ee him &s;erving a
cu&s;tomer, I never interrupt them, unle&s;s &s;ome|times
he is &s;o mode&s;t he will call me, and turn|ing
to the ladies &s;ay, <HI>There's my ma&s;ter, Madam,</HI>
if you think he will abate you any thing I`ll call
him; and &s;ometimes they will look a little &s;ur|pri&s;ed,
and &s;ay, is that your ma&s;ter? indeed we
thought you had been the ma&s;ter of the &s;hop
your&s;elf.</P>
<P>WELL, <HI>&s;aid I,</HI> and you think your&s;elf very
happy in all this, don't you? pray how long
has this young gentleman to &s;erve? how long is
it before his time will be out? O, he has al|mo&s;t
a year and half to &s;erve, &s;ays the &s;hop-keeper.
I hope then, <HI>&s;ay I,</HI> you will take care
to have him knock'd on the head, as &s;oon as
his time is out. God forbid, &s;ays <HI>the hone&s;t
man,</HI> what do you mean by that? mean! <HI>&s;ay
I,</HI> why if you don't, he will certainly knock
your trade on the head as &s;oon as the year and
half comes to be up; either you mu&s;t di&s;po&s;e
of him, as I &s;ay, or take care that he does not
&s;et up near you, no, not in the &s;ame &s;treet;
if you do, your cu&s;tomers will all run thither;
<PB N="179" REF="198">
when they mi&s;s him in the &s;hop, they will pre|&s;ently
enquire for him; and as, you &s;ay, they
generally take him for the ma&s;ter, they will ask
whether the gentleman, is remov'd that kept the
&s;hop before.</P>
<P>ALL <HI>my &s;hop-keeper</HI> could &s;ay, was, that he
had got a &s;alve for that &s;tore; and that was, that
when <HI>Timothy</HI> was out of his time, <HI>that was
his name,</HI> he re&s;olv'd to take him in partner.</P>
<P>A very good thing indeed! &s;o you mu&s;t take
<HI>Timothy</HI> into half the trade when he is out of
his time, for fear he &s;hould run away with three
quarters of it, when he &s;ets up for him&s;elf.
But had not the ma&s;ter much better have been
<HI>Timothy</HI> him&s;elf? then he had been &s;ure never
to have the cu&s;tomers take <HI>Timothy</HI> for the ma|&s;ter,
and when he went away, and &s;et up per|haps
at next door, leave the &s;hop, and run after
him.</P>
<P>'Tis certain, a good &s;ervant, a faithful, in|du&s;trious,
obliging &s;ervant is a ble&s;&s;ing to a
trade&s;man, and, <HI>as he &s;aid,</HI> is an e&s;tate to his
ma&s;ter: but the ma&s;ter, by laying the &s;tre&s;s of
his bu&s;ine&s;s upon him, dive&s;ts him&s;elf of all the
advantages of &s;uch a &s;ervant, and turns the ble&s;|&s;ing
into a bla&s;t; for by giving up the &s;hop, as
it were, to him, and indulging him&s;elf in be|ing
abroad, and ab&s;ent from his bu&s;ine&s;s, the
apprentice gets the ma&s;tery of the bu&s;ine&s;s, the
&s;ame of the &s;hop depends upon him, and when
he &s;ets up, certainly follows him; &s;uch a &s;er|vant
would with the ma&s;ter's attendance too, be
very helpful, and yet not be dangerous; &s;uch a &s;ervant is well, when he is vi&s;ibly an a&s;&s;i&s;tant
<PB N="180" REF="199">
to the ma&s;ter, but is ruinous when he is taken
for the ma&s;ter. There is a great deal of diffe|rence
between a &s;ervant's being <HI>the &s;tay</HI> of his
ma&s;ter, and his being <HI>the &s;tay</HI> of his trade;
when he is <HI>the fir&s;t,</HI> the ma&s;ter is &s;erv'd by him,
and when he is gone he breeds up another to
follow his &s;teps; but when he is <HI>the la&s;t,</HI> he
carries the trade with him, and does his ma&s;ter
infinitely more hurt than good.</P>
<P>A trade&s;man has a great deal of trouble with
a bad &s;ervant, but mu&s;t take heed he is not
wounded by a good one: the extravagant idle
vagrant &s;ervant hurts him&s;elf, but the diligent
&s;ervant endangers his ma&s;ter; the greater repu|tation
the &s;ervant gets in his bu&s;ine&s;s, the more
care the ma&s;ter has upon him, le&s;t he gets
within him, and worms him out of his bu&s;i|ne&s;s.</P>
<P>THE only way to prevent this, and yet not
injure a diligent &s;ervant, is, that the ma&s;ter be
as diligent as the &s;ervant, that the ma&s;ter be as
much at the &s;hop as the man: he that will
keep in his bu&s;ine&s;s, need never fear keeping
his bu&s;ine&s;s, let his &s;ervant be as diligent as
he will. 'Tis a hard thing that a trade&s;man
&s;hould have the ble&s;&s;ing of a good &s;ervant, and
make it a cur&s;e to him by his appearing le&s;s ca|pable
than his man.</P>
<P>LET your apprentice be in the bu&s;ine&s;s, but
let the ma&s;ter be at the head of the bu&s;ine&s;s
at all times: there is a great deal of difference
between being diligent in the bu&s;ine&s;s <HI>in the
&s;hop,</HI> and leading the whole bu&s;ine&s;s <HI>of the &s;hop;</HI>
an apprentice who is diligent may be ma&s;ter of
<PB N="181" REF="200">
his bu&s;ine&s;s, but &s;hould never be ma&s;ter of the
&s;hop; the one is to be u&s;eful to his ma&s;ter, the
other is to be ma&s;ter of his ma&s;ter; and indeed
this &s;hews the ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity of diligence
and application in a trade&s;man, and how, for
want of it, that very thing which is the ble&s;|&s;ing
of another tradesman's bu&s;ine&s;s, is the ruin
of his.</P>
<P>SERVANTS, e&s;pecially apprentices, ought to
be con&s;idered, as they really are, in their move|able
&s;tation, that they are here with you but
&s;even years, and that then they act or move in a
&s;phere or &s;tation of their own; their dili|gence
is now for you, but ever after it is for
them&s;elves; that the better &s;ervants they have
been while they were with you, the more dan|gerous
they will be to you when you part;
that therefore, tho' you are bound in ju&s;tice to
them to let them into your bu&s;ine&s;s in every
branch of it, yet you are not bound to give
your bu&s;ine&s;s away to them; the diligence
therefore of a good &s;ervant in the ma&s;ter's bu&s;i|ne&s;s
&s;hould be a &s;pur to the ma&s;ter's diligence
to take care of him&s;elf.</P>
<P>THERE is a great deal of difference al&s;o be|tween
tru&s;ting a &s;ervant in your bu&s;ine&s;s, and
tru&s;ting him with your bu&s;ine&s;s: the fir&s;t is leav|ing
your bu&s;ine&s;s with him, the other is leaving
your bu&s;ine&s;s to him; he that tru&s;ts a &s;ervant in
his bu&s;ine&s;s, leaves his &s;hop only to him; but
he that leaves his bu&s;ine&s;s to his &s;ervant, leaves
his wife and children at his di&s;po&s;e: <HI>in a word,</HI>
&s;uch a tru&s;ting or leaving the bu&s;ine&s;s to the
&s;ervant is no le&s;s than a giving up all to him,
<PB N="182" REF="201">
abandoning the care of his &s;hop and all his af|fairs
to him; and when &s;uch a &s;ervant is out
of his time the ma&s;ter runs a terrible ri&s;que,
&s;uch as indeed it is not fit any trade&s;man &s;hould
run, namely, of lo&s;ing the be&s;t of his bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>WHAT I have been now &s;aying, is of the
trade&s;man leaving his bu&s;ine&s;s to his apprentices
and &s;ervants, when they prove good, when
they are hone&s;t and diligent, faithful and in|du&s;trious;
and if there are dangers even in
tru&s;ting good &s;ervants, and &s;uch as do their du|ty
perfectly well, what then mu&s;t it be when
the bu&s;ine&s;s is left to idle, negligent and ex|travagant
&s;ervants, who both neglect their ma&s;|ter's
bu&s;ine&s;s and their own, who neither learn
their trade for them&s;elves, or regard it for the
intere&s;t of their ma&s;ters? if the fir&s;t are a ble&s;|&s;ing
to their ma&s;ters, and may only be made
dangerous by their carrying away the trade
with them when they go, the&s;e are made
cur&s;es to their ma&s;ters early, for they lo&s;e the
trade for them&s;elves and their ma&s;ters too.
The fir&s;t carry the cu&s;tomers away with them,
the la&s;t drive the cu&s;tomers away before they
go. What &s;ignifies going to &s;uch a &s;hop, <HI>&s;ay
the Ladies,</HI> either &s;peaking of a mercer or dra|per,
or any other trade? there's nothing to be
met with there but a crew of &s;aucy boys
that are always at play when you come in, and can
hardly refrain it when you are there; one hard|ly
ever &s;ees a ma&s;ter in the &s;hop, and the young
rude boys hardly mind you when you are look|ing
on their goods; they talk to you as if they
cared not whether you laid out your money or
<PB N="183" REF="202">
no, and as if they had rather you were gone,
that they might go to play again; <HI>I'll go there
no mores, not I.</HI></P>
<P>IF this be not the ca&s;e, then you are in dan|ger
of wor&s;e &s;till, and that is, that they are of|ten
thieves; <HI>idle ones</HI> are &s;eldom <HI>hone&s;t ones;</HI>
nay, they cannot indeed be hone&s;t in a &s;trict
&s;en&s;e if they are idle: but by di&s;hone&s;t, I mean
downright thieves; and what is more dangerous
than for an apprentice, to whom the whole bu|&s;ine&s;s,
the ca&s;h, the books, and all is commit|ted,
to be a thief?</P>
<P>FOR a trade&s;man therefore to commit his bu|&s;ine&s;s
thus into the hand of a fal&s;e, a negligent
and a thievi&s;h &s;ervant, is like a man that travels
a journey, and takes a highway man into the
coach with him; &s;uch a man is &s;ure to be rob|bed,
and to be fully and effectually plundered,
becau&s;e he di&s;covers where he hides his trea&s;ure.
Thus the trade&s;man places his confidence in the
thief, and how &s;hould he avoid being robb'd?</P>
<P>IT is an&s;wered, that generally trade&s;men, who
have any con&s;iderable tru&s;t to put into the hands
of an apprentice, take &s;ecurity of them for their
hone&s;ty by their friends, when their indentures
are &s;ign'd, and 'tis their fault then, if they are
not &s;ecure. It is true, 'tis often &s;o; but in a
retail bu&s;ine&s;s, if the &s;ervant be unfaithful, there
are &s;o many ways to defraud a ma&s;ter, be&s;ides
that of merely not ballancing the ca&s;h, that 'tis
impo&s;&s;ible to detect them; and unle&s;s provi|dence,
<HI>as &s;ometimes it does,</HI> makes the di&s;co|very
by wonder and miracle, 'tis never found
out at all; till the trade&s;man declining in&s;en&s;ibly
<PB N="184" REF="203">
by the weight of the lo&s;s is ruin'd and un|done.</P>
<P>WHAT need then has the trade&s;man to give
a clo&s;e attendance, and pre&s;erve him&s;elf from
plunder, by acquainting him&s;elf in and with
his bu&s;ine&s;s and &s;ervants, by which he makes it
very difficult for them to deceive him, and
much ea&s;ier to him to di&s;cover it if he &s;u&s;pects
them: but if the trade&s;man lives abroad, keeps
at his country-hou&s;e or lodgings, and leaves his
bu&s;ine&s;s thus in the hands of his &s;ervants, com|mitting
his affairs to them, as is often the ca&s;e,
if they prove thieves, negligent, carele&s;s and
idle, what is the con&s;equence? he is in&s;en&s;ibly
wrong'd, his &s;ub&s;tance wa&s;ted, his bu&s;ine&s;s neglected;
and how &s;hall a trade&s;man thrive un|der
&s;uch circum&s;tances? Nay, how is it po&s;&s;ible
he &s;hould avoid ruin and de&s;truction? I mean,
as to his bu&s;ine&s;s; for in &s;hort, every &s;uch &s;er|vant
has his hand in his ma&s;ter's pocket, and
may u&s;e him as he plea&s;es.</P>
<P>AGAIN, if they are not thieves, yet if they
are idle and negligent, 'tis in &s;ome ca&s;es the
&s;ame thing; and I wi&s;h it were well recom|mended
to all &s;uch &s;ervants as call them&s;elves
hone&s;t, that it is as criminal to neglect their
ma&s;ter's bu&s;ine&s;s, as to rob him; and he is as
really a thief who robs him of his time, as he
that robs him of his money.</P>
<P>I know, <HI>as &s;ervants are now,</HI> this is a prin|ciple
they will not allow, neither does one &s;er|vant
in fifty act by it; but if the ma&s;ter be
ab&s;ent, the &s;ervant is at his heels; that is to
&s;ay, is as &s;oon out of doors as his ma&s;ter, and
<PB N="185" REF="204">
having none but his con&s;cience to an&s;wer to,
he makes &s;hift to compound with him&s;elf, like
a bankrupt with his creditor, to pay half the
debt; that is to &s;ay, half the time to his ma&s;ter,
and half to him&s;elf, and think it good pay
too.</P>
<P>THE point of con&s;cience indeed &s;eems to be
out of the que&s;tion now, between ma&s;ter and
&s;ervant; and as few ma&s;ters concern them&s;elves
with the &s;ouls, nay, &s;carce with the morals of
their &s;ervants, either to in&s;truct them, or inform
them of their duty either to GOD or <HI>man,</HI> much
le&s;s to re&s;train them by force, or correct them,
as was antiently practi&s;ed; &s;o, few &s;ervants con|cern
them&s;elves in a con&s;cientious di&s;charge of
their duty to their ma&s;ters: &s;o that the great
law of &s;ubordination is de&s;troy'd, and the rela|tive
duties on both &s;ides are neglected; all
which, as I take it, is owing to the exorbitant
&s;ums of money which are now given with &s;er|vants
to the ma&s;ters, as the pre&s;ent or condition
of their apprentice&s;hip; which as it is extrava|gant
in it &s;elf, &s;o it gives the &s;ervant a kind of
a different figure in the family, places him above
the ordinary cla&s;s of &s;ervants hired for wages,
and exempts him from all the laws of family-government;
&s;o that a ma&s;ter &s;eems now to
have nothing to do with his apprentice, any
other than in what relates to his bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>AND as the &s;ervant knows this, &s;o he fails
not to take the advantage of it, and to pay no
more &s;ervice than he thinks is due; and the
hours of his &s;hop bu&s;ine&s;s being run out, he
claims all the re&s;t for him&s;elf, without <HI>the a|bove</HI>
<PB N="186" REF="205">
re&s;traint. Nor will the &s;ervants in the&s;e
times bear any examinations with re&s;pect to the
di&s;po&s;ing of their wa&s;te time, or with re&s;pect
to the company they keep, or the hou&s;es or
places they go to.</P>
<P>THE u&s;e I make of it is this, and herein it is
ju&s;tly applicable to the ca&s;e in hand; by how
much the apprentices and &s;ervants in this age
are loo&s;e, wild, and ungovernable, by &s;o much
the more &s;hould a ma&s;ter think him&s;elf ob|liged
not to depend upon them, much le&s;s to
leave his bu&s;ine&s;s to them, and di&s;pen&s;e with his
own attendance in it; if he does, he mu&s;t have
much better luck than his neighbours if he
does not find him&s;elf very much wrong'd and
abu&s;ed, &s;eeing, <HI>as I &s;aid above,</HI> the &s;ervants
and apprentices of this age do very rarely act
from a principle of con&s;cience in &s;erving their
ma&s;ters intere&s;t; which however I do not &s;ee
they can be good chri&s;tians without.</P>
<P>I knew one very con&s;iderable trade&s;man in
this city, and who had always five or &s;ix &s;er|vants
in his bu&s;ine&s;s, apprentices and journey|men
who lodged in his hou&s;e, and having a
little more the &s;pirit of government in him
than mo&s;t ma&s;ters I now meet with, he took
this method with them; when he took an ap|prentice
he told them beforehand the orders of
his family, and which he &s;hould oblige them to;
particularly, that they &s;hould none of them be
ab&s;ent from his bu&s;ine&s;s without leave, nor out
of the hou&s;e after nine a clock at night; and
that he would not have it thought hard, if he
exacted three things of them:</P>
<P><PB N="187" REF="206">
1. THAT if they had been out he &s;hould ask
them where they had been, and in what com|pany?
and that they &s;hould give him a true and
direct an&s;wer.</P>
<P>2. THAT if he found rea&s;on to forbid them
keeping company with any particular per&s;on,
or in any particular hou&s;e or family, they &s;hould
be obliged to refrain from &s;uch company.</P>
<P>3. THAT in breach of any of tho&s;e two, af|ter
being po&s;itively charg'd with it, he would
on their promi&s;ing to amend it, forgive them,
only acquainting their friends of it; but the
&s;econd time he would di&s;mi&s;s them his &s;ervice,
and not be oblig'd to return any of the money
he had with them. And to the&s;e he made
their parents con&s;ent when they were bound;
and yet he had large &s;ums of money with them
too; not le&s;s than two hundred pounds each,
and &s;ometimes more.</P>
<P>As to his journeymen, he conditioned with
them <HI>as follows:</HI></P>
<P>1. THEY &s;hould never dine from home with|out
leave asked and obtained, and telling where,
<HI>if required.</HI></P>
<P>2. AFTER the &s;hutting in of the &s;hop, they
were at liberty to go where they plea&s;ed, only
not to be out of the hou&s;e after nine a clock
at night.</P>
<P>3. NEVER to be in drink, or to &s;wear, on
pain of being immediately di&s;mi&s;s'd without the
courte&s;y u&s;ual with &s;uch &s;ervants, <HI>viz.</HI> of a
month's warning.</P>
<P>THESE were excellent hou&s;hold laws, but the
que&s;tion is, how &s;hall a ma&s;ter &s;ee them
<PB N="188" REF="207">
punctually obey'd; for the life of all laws de|pends
upon their being well executed; and we
are famous in <HI>England</HI> for being remi&s;s in that
very point; and that <HI>we have the be&s;t laws the
wor&s;t executed</HI> of any nation in the world.</P>
<P>BUT my friend was a man who knew as well
how to make his laws be well executed, as he
did how to make the laws them&s;elves. His
ca&s;e was thus, he kept a country hou&s;e about
two miles from <HI>London,</HI> in the &s;ummer-time,
for the air for his wife and children, and there
he maintained them very comfortably: but it
was a rule with him, that he who expects his
&s;ervants to obey his orders, mu&s;t be always up|on
the &s;pot with them to &s;ee it done; to this
purpo&s;e he confined him&s;elf to lie always at
home, tho' his family was in the country; and
every afternoon he walk'd out to &s;ee them, and
to give him&s;elf the air too; but always &s;o or|dered
his diver&s;ions, that he was &s;ure to be at
home before nine at night, that he might call
over his family, and &s;ee that they ob&s;erv'd or|ders;
that is, that they were all at home at
their time, and all &s;ober.</P>
<P>AS this was indeed the only way to have good
&s;ervants, and an orderly family, &s;o he had
both; but it was owing much, if not all, to
the exactne&s;s of his government; and would all
ma&s;ters take the &s;ame method, I doubt not
they would have the like &s;ucce&s;s; but what &s;er|vants
can a man expect when he leaves them
to their own government, not regarding whe|ther
they &s;erve GOD or the <HI>Devil?</HI>
<PB N="189" REF="208">
Now though this man had a very regular fa|mily,
and very good &s;ervants, yet he had this
particular qualification too for a good trade&s;|man,
<HI>viz.</HI> that he never left his bu&s;ine&s;s entire|ly
to them, nor could any of them boa&s;t, that
they were tru&s;ted to, more than another.</P>
<P>THIS is certainly the way to have regular &s;er|vants,
and to have bu&s;ine&s;s thrive; but this is
not practi&s;ed by one ma&s;ter to a thou&s;and at
this time; if it were, we &s;hould &s;oon &s;ee a
change in the families of trade&s;men, and that
very much for the better: nor indeed would
this family-government be good for the trade&s;|men
only, but it would be the &s;ervant's advan|tage
too: and &s;uch a practice we may &s;ay would
in time reform all the next age, and make them
a&s;ham'd of us that went before them.</P>
<P>IF then the morals of &s;ervants are thus loo&s;e
and debauched, and that it is a general and epi|demick
evil, how much le&s;s ought trade&s;men of
this age to tru&s;t them, and &s;till le&s;s to venture
their all upon them, leave their great de&s;ign,
the event of all their bu&s;ine&s;s with them, and
go in the country in per&s;uit of their plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>THE ca&s;e of trade&s;men differs extremely in
this age from tho&s;e in the la&s;t, with re&s;pect to
their apprentices and &s;ervants; and the difference
in all to the di&s;advantge of the pre&s;ent age, <HI>viz.</HI>
in the la&s;t age, <HI>that is to &s;ay,</HI> fifty or &s;ixty years
ago, <HI>for it is not le&s;s,</HI> &s;ervants were infinitely
more under &s;ubjection than they are now, and
the &s;ubordination of mankind extended effectu|ally
to them; they were content to &s;ubmit to
family-governtment; and the ju&s;t regulations,

which ma&s;ters made in their hou&s;es, were
not &s;corn'd and contemn'd as they are now;
family-religion al&s;o had &s;ome &s;way upon them,

pre&s;erve the wor&s;hip of God in their hou&s;es, the

at the u&s;ual hours for &s;uch &s;ervices; nay,
it has been known, where &s;uch orders have

has been &s;ick, or indi&s;po&s;ed, or out of town,
the elde&s;t apprentice has read prayers to the fa|mily
in his place.</P>
<P>HOW ridiculous, to &s;peak in the language of
the pre&s;ent times, would it be for any ma&s;ter
to expect this of a &s;ervant in our days? and
where is the &s;ervant that would comply with
it? nay, 'tis but very rare now, that ma&s;ters
them&s;elves do it; 'tis rather thought now to
be a low &s;tep, and beneath the character of a
man in bu&s;ine&s;s, as if wor&s;hipping God was a
di&s;grace, and not an honour to a family, or to
the ma&s;ter of a family; and I doubt not but in
a little while more, either the wor&s;hip of God
will be quite bani&s;h'd out of families, or the
better &s;ort of trade&s;men, and &s;uch as have any
regard to it, will keep Chaplains, <HI>as other per|&s;ons
of quality do.</HI> It is confe&s;s'd, the fir&s;t is
mo&s;t probable, tho' the la&s;t, as I am inform'd,
is already begun in the city, in &s;ome hou&s;es,
where the reader of the pari&s;h is allow'd a &s;mall
additional &s;alary to come once a day, <HI>viz.</HI> eve|ry
evening, to read prayers in the hou&s;e.</P>
<P>BUT I am not talking on this &s;ubject; I am
not directing my&s;elf to citizens or town&s;men,
<PB N="191" REF="210">
as ma&s;ters of families, but as heads of trade,
and ma&s;ters in their bu&s;ine&s;s; the other part
would indeed require a whole book by it&s;elf,
and would in&s;en&s;ibly run me into a long &s;aty|rical
di&s;cour&s;e upon the lo&s;s of all family-go|vernment
among us; in which indeed the pra|ctice
of hou&s;e-keepers and heads of families is
grown not remi&s;s only in all &s;erious things, but
even &s;candalous in their own morals, and in the
per&s;onal examples they &s;hew to their &s;ervants,
and all about them.</P>
<P>BUT to come back to my &s;ubject, <HI>viz.</HI> that
the ca&s;e of trade&s;men differs extremely from
what it was formerly: the &s;econd head of dif|ference
is this; that whereas in former times
the &s;ervants were better and humbler than they
are now, &s;ubmitted more to family-government,
and to the regulations made by their ma&s;ters,
and ma&s;ters were more moral, &s;et better exam|ples,
and kept better order in their hou&s;es, and
by con&s;equence of it all &s;ervants were &s;oberer,
and fitter to be tru&s;ted than they are now; yet
on the other hand, notwith&s;tanding all their &s;o|bri$ty,
matters did not then &s;o much depend
upon them, leave bu&s;ine&s;s to them, and com|mit
the management of their affairs &s;o entirely
to their &s;ervants, as they do now.</P>
<P>ALL <HI>that I meet with,</HI> which ma&s;ters have
to &s;ay to this, is contain'd in two heads, and
tho&s;e in my opinion amount to very little.</P>
<P>I. THAT they have &s;ecurity for their &s;ervants
hone&s;ty, which in former times they had not.</P>
<P><PB N="192" REF="211">
II. THAT they receive greater proemio's, or
pre&s;ent-money, now with their apprentices, than
they did formerly.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t of the&s;e is of no moment; for <HI>fir&s;t,</HI>
it does not appear, that apprentices in tho&s;e
former days gave no &s;ecurity to their ma&s;ters for
their integrity, which, tho' perhaps not &s;o ge|nerally
as now, yet I have good rea&s;on to know
was then practi&s;ed among trade&s;men of note,
and is not now among inferior trade&s;men:
but, <HI>&s;econdly,</HI> this &s;ecurity extends to nothing,
but to make the ma&s;ter &s;atisfaction for any mi&s;|applications,
or embezzlements, which are di&s;|cover'd,
and can be prov'd, but extend to no
&s;ecret conceal'd mi&s;chiefs: neither, <HI>thirdly,</HI> do
tho&s;e &s;ecurities reach to the negligence, idle|ne&s;s,
or debaucheries of &s;ervants; but, <HI>which
is &s;till more than all the re&s;t,</HI> they do not reach
to the wor&s;t &s;ort of robbery between the &s;er|vant
and his ma&s;ter, I mean <HI>the lo&s;s of his time;</HI>
&s;o that &s;till there is as much rea&s;on for the ma|&s;ter's
in&s;pection, both into his &s;ervants and their
bu&s;ine&s;s, as ever.</P>
<P>BUT lea&s;t of all does this &s;ecurity reach to
make the ma&s;ter any &s;atisfaction for the lo&s;s of
his bu&s;ine&s;s, the ill management of his &s;hop,
the di&s;reputation brought upon it by being com|mitted
to &s;ervants, and tho&s;e &s;ervants behaving
ill, &s;lighting, neglecting, or di&s;obliging cu&s;tom|ers;
this does not relate to &s;ecurities given or
taken, nor can the ma&s;ter make him&s;elf any a|mends
upon his &s;ervant, or upon his &s;ecurities,
for this irrecoverable damage. He therefore, that
<PB N="193" REF="212">
will keep up the reputation of his &s;hop, or of
his bu&s;ine&s;s, and pre&s;erve his trade to his own
advantage, mu&s;t re&s;olve to attend it him&s;elf,
and not leave it to &s;ervants, whether good or
bad; if he leaves it to good &s;ervants, they improve
it for them&s;elves, and carry the trade away with
them when they go; if to bad &s;ervants, they
drive his cu&s;tomers away, bring a &s;candal upon
his &s;hop, and de&s;troy both their ma&s;ter and them|&s;elves.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> As to the receiving great proemia's
with their apprentices, which indeed is grown
up to a &s;trange height in this age, beyond what|ever
it was before; it is an unaccountable ex|ce&s;s,
which is the ruin of more &s;ervants at this
time, than all the other exce&s;&s;es they are &s;ub|ject
to; nay, in &s;ome re&s;pect it is the cau&s;e of it
all; and, on the contrary, is far from being an
equivalent to their ma&s;ters for the defect of their
&s;ervice, but is an unan&s;werable rea&s;on why the
ma&s;ter &s;hould not leave his bu&s;ine&s;s to their ma|nagement.</P>
<P>THIS proemium was originally not a condi|tion
of indenture, but was a kind of u&s;ual or
cu&s;tomary pre&s;ent to the trade&s;man's wife to en|gage
her to be kind to the youth, and take a
motherly care of him, being &s;uppos'd to be
young when fir&s;t put out.</P>
<P>BY length of time this compliment or pre|&s;ent
became &s;o cu&s;tomary, as to be made a debt,
and to be conditioned for as a demand; but
&s;till was kept within bounds, and thirty or
forty pounds was &s;ufficient to a very good mer|chant,
which now is run up to five hundred,
<PB N="194" REF="213">
nay, to a thou&s;and pounds with an apprentice;
a thing which formerly would have been thought
mon&s;trous, and not to be nam'd.</P>
<P>THE ill con&s;equences of giving the&s;e large
proemio's are &s;uch and &s;o many, that it is not
to be enter'd upon in &s;uch a &s;mall tract as this;
nor is it the de&s;ign of this work: but it is thus
far to the purpo&s;e here, <HI>namely,</HI> as it &s;hews,
that this &s;ets up &s;ervants into a cla&s;s of gentle|men
above their ma&s;ters, and above their bu|&s;ine&s;s,
and they neither have a &s;ufficient regard
to one or other; and con&s;equently are the le&s;s
fit to be tru&s;ted by the ma&s;ter in the e&s;&s;ential
parts of his bu&s;ine&s;s, and this brings it down
to the ca&s;e in hand.</P>
<P>UPON the whole, the pre&s;ent &s;tate of things
between ma&s;ters and &s;ervants is &s;uch, that now
more than ever the caution is needful and ju&s;t,
that he that leaves his bu&s;ine&s;s to the manage|ment
of his &s;ervants, 'tis ten to one but he ru|ins
his bu&s;ine&s;s, and his &s;ervants too.</P>
<P>RUINING his bu&s;ine&s;s is indeed my pre&s;ent
&s;ubject; but ruining his &s;ervants al&s;o is a con|&s;ideration
that an hone&s;t con&s;cientious ma&s;ter
ought to think is of weight with him, and will
concern him&s;elf about. Servants out of govern|ment
are like &s;oldiers without an officer, fit for
nothing but to rob and plunder; without order,
and without orders; they neither know what to
do, or are directed how to do it.</P>
<P>BESIDES 'tis letting loo&s;e his apprentices to
levity and liberty in that particular critical time
of life, when they have the mo&s;t need of go|vernment
and re&s;traint: when &s;hould laws and
<PB N="195" REF="214">
limits be u&s;eful to mankind but in their youth,
when unlimited liberty is mo&s;t fatal to them,
and when they are lea&s;t capable of governing
them&s;elves? to have youth left without govern|ment
is leaving fire in a magazine of powder,
which will certainly blow it all up at la&s;t, and
ruin all the hou&s;es that are near it.</P>
<P>IF there is any duty on the &s;ide of a ma&s;ter
to his &s;ervant, any obligation on him as a chri|&s;tian,
and as a tru&s;tee for his parents, it lies
here; to limit and re&s;train them, if po&s;&s;ible,
in the liberty of doing evil; and this is certain|ly
a debt due to the tru&s;t repos'd in ma&s;ters by
the parents of the youth committed to them; if
he is let loo&s;e here, he is undone of cour&s;e,
and it may be &s;aid indeed, he was ruin'd by
his ma&s;ter; and if the ma&s;ter is afterwards ru|in'd
by &s;uch a &s;ervant, what can be &s;aid for it
but this? <HI>He could expect no other.</HI></P>
<P>TO leave a youth without government is in|deed
unworthy of any hone&s;t ma&s;ter; he can|not
di&s;charge him&s;elf <HI>as a ma&s;ter;</HI> for in&s;tead
of taking care of him he indeed ca&s;ts him off,
abandons him, and, to put it into &s;cripture
words, he <HI>leads him into temptation;</HI> nay, he
goes farther, to u&s;e another &s;cripture expre&s;&s;ion,
<HI>he delivers him over to Satan.</HI></P>
<P>IT is confe&s;s'd, and 'tis fatal both to ma&s;ters
and &s;ervants at this time, that not only &s;er|vants
are made haughty, and above the govern|ment
of their ma&s;ters, and think it below them
to &s;ubmit to any family-government, or any re|&s;traints
of their ma&s;ters, as to their morals and
religion; but ma&s;ters al&s;o &s;eem to have given
<PB N="196" REF="215">
up all family-government, and all care or con|cern
for the morals and manners, as well as for
the religion of their &s;ervants, thinking them|&s;elves
under no obligation to meddle with tho&s;e
things, or to think any thing about them, &s;o
that their bu&s;ine&s;s be but done, and their &s;hop
or warehou&s;e duly look'd after.</P>
<P>BUT to bring it all home to the point in hand,
if it is &s;o with the ma&s;ter and &s;ervant, there is
the le&s;s room &s;till for the ma&s;ter of &s;uch &s;ervants
to leave any con&s;iderable tru&s;t in the hands of
&s;uch apprentices, or to expect much from them;
to leave the weight of their affairs with them,
and living at their country-lodgings, and taking
their own diver&s;ions, depend upon &s;uch &s;er|vants
for the &s;ucce&s;s of their bu&s;ine&s;s; this is
indeed abandoning their bu&s;ine&s;s, throwing it
away, and committing them&s;elves, families, and
fortunes, to the conduct of tho&s;e, who they have
all the rea&s;on in the world to believe have no
concern upon them for their good, or care one
farthing what becomes of them.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_THERE is an alternative in the &s;ubject
of this letter, which places the di&s;|cour&s;e
in the two extremes of a trade&s;|man's
fortunes.</P>
<P>I. THE <HI>fortunate trade&s;man,</HI> call'd upon by

debtor, and is become in&s;olvent, to have com|pa&s;&s;ion
on him, and to compound with him

di&s;charge of the whole.</P>
<P>II. THE <HI>unfortunate trade&s;man</HI> become in|&s;olvent
and bankrupt him&s;elf, and applying
him&s;elf to his creditor to accept of a compo|&s;ition,
in di&s;charge of his debt.</P>
<P>I. THE <HI>fortunate trade&s;man,</HI> call'd upon by
his poor unfortunate neighbour, who is his debt|or,
and is become in&s;olvent, to have compa&s;&s;ion
on him, and to compound with him for part
of his debt, and accept his offer in di&s;charge of
the whole.</P>
<P><PB N="198" REF="217">
I mu&s;t confe&s;s a trade&s;man, let his circum|&s;tances
be what they will, has the mo&s;t rea&s;on
to con&s;ider the di&s;a&s;ters of the unfortunate, and
be compa&s;&s;ionate to them under their pre&s;&s;ures
and di&s;a&s;ters, of any other men; becau&s;e they
know not, no not the mo&s;t pro&s;perous of them,
what may be their own fate in the world. There
is a &s;cripture proverb, <HI>if I may call it &s;o,</HI> very
nece&s;&s;ary to a trade&s;man in this ca&s;e, <HI>Let him
that thinketh he &s;tandeth, take heed left he fall.</HI></P>
<Q><HI>N. B.</HI> It is not &s;aid, let him that &s;tandeth
take heed, but him <HI>that thinketh</HI> he &s;tand|eth:
men in trade <HI>can but think</HI> they &s;tand;
and there are &s;o many incidents in a trade&s;|man's
circum&s;tances, that &s;ometimes when
he thinks him&s;elf mo&s;t &s;ecure of &s;tanding,
he is in mo&s;t danger of falling.</Q>
<P>IF then the contingent nature of trade ren|ders
every man liable to di&s;a&s;ter that is engag'd
in it, it &s;eems &s;trange that trade&s;men &s;hould
be outrageous and unmerciful to one another,
when they fall; and yet <HI>&s;o it is,</HI> that no cre|ditor
is &s;o furious upon an unhappy in&s;olvent
trade&s;man, as a brother trade&s;man of his own
cla&s;s, and who is at lea&s;t liable to the &s;ame di&s;|a&s;ter
in the common event of his bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>NAY, I have liv'd to &s;ee, <HI>&s;uch is the uncer|tainty
of human affairs,</HI> and e&s;pecially in trade,
the furious and outrageous creditor become bank|rupt
him&s;elf in a few years, or perhaps months
after, and begging the &s;ame mercy of others,
which he but ju&s;t before denied to his <HI>not more</HI>
<PB N="199" REF="218">
unfortunate fellow trade&s;man, and making the
&s;ame exclamations at the cruelty and hard hearted|ne&s;s
of his creditors in refu&s;ing to comply with
him; when at the &s;ame time his own heart mu&s;t
reproach him with his former conduct, how in|exorable
he was to all the entreaties and tears
of his mi&s;erable neighbour and his di&s;tre&s;&s;ed fa|mily,
who begg'd his compa&s;&s;ion with the low|e&s;t
&s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, who employ'd friends to &s;olicit
and entreat for them, laying forth their mi&s;cry
in the mo&s;t lively expre&s;&s;ions, and u&s;ing all the
arguments which the mo&s;t moving di&s;tre&s;s could
dictate, but in vain.</P>
<P>THE trade&s;man is certainly wrong in this, as
compa&s;&s;ion to the mi&s;erable is a debt of charity
due from all mankind to their fellow-creatures;
and tho' the pur&s;e-proud trade&s;man may be able
to &s;ay, he is above the fear of being in the like
circum&s;tances, as &s;ome may be; yet even then
he might reflect, that perhaps there was a time
when he was not &s;o, and he ought to pay that
debt of charity, in acknowledgment of the mer|cy
that has &s;et him above the danger.</P>
<P>AND yet &s;peaking in the ordinary language
of men, who are &s;ubject to vici&s;&s;itudes of for|tune,
where is the man that is &s;ure he &s;hall
meet with no &s;hock? and how have we &s;een
men, who have <HI>to day</HI> been immen&s;ely rich,
be <HI>to morrow,</HI> as it were, reduc'd to nothing?
what examples were made in this city of &s;uch
precipitations within the memory of &s;ome liv|ing,
when the Exchequer &s;hutting up ruin'd the
great Bankers of <HI>Lombard-&s;treet?</HI> to what fell
Sir <HI>Robert Viner,</HI> the great alderman <HI>Backwell,</HI>
<PB N="200" REF="219">
the three brothers of the name of <HI>Forth,</HI> of
whom King <HI>Charles</HI> II. made that &s;evere <HI>pun,</HI>
that <HI>three fourths of the city were broke?</HI></P>
<P>TO what have we &s;een men of prodigious bulk
in trade reduc'd, as Sir <HI>Thomas Cook,</HI> Sir <HI>Ba&s;il
Firebra&s;s, Sheppard, Coggs,</HI> and innumerable
bankers, money-&s;criveners, and merchants, who
thought them&s;elves as &s;ecure again&s;t the &s;hocks
of trade, as any men in the world could be?
not to in&s;tance in our late <HI>South-&s;ea Directors,</HI>
and others, reduc'd by the terrible fate of bub|bles,
whole names I omit, becau&s;e they yet live,
tho' &s;inking &s;till under the oppre&s;&s;ion of their
fortunes, and who&s;e weight I would be far from
endeavouring to make heavier.</P>
<P>WHY then &s;hould any trade&s;man, pre&s;uming
on his own &s;ecurity, and of his being out of
the reach of di&s;a&s;ter, harden his heart again&s;t
the mi&s;eries and di&s;tre&s;&s;es of a fellow trade&s;man,
who &s;inks as it were by his &s;ide, and refu&s;e to
accept his offer of compo&s;ition; at lea&s;t, if he
cannot object again&s;t the integrity of his repre|&s;entations,
and cannot charge him with fraud
and deceit, breaking with a wicked de&s;ign to
cheat and delude his creditors, and to get mo|ney
by a pretended breach? I &s;ay, why &s;hould
any trade&s;man harden his heart in &s;uch a ca&s;e,
and not with a generous pity comply with a
rea&s;onable and fair propo&s;al, while it is to be
had?</P>
<P>I do acknowledge, if there's an evident fraud,
if he can detect the bankrupt in any wicked de|&s;ign,
if he can prove he has effects &s;ufficient to
pay his debts, and that he only breaks with a
<PB N="201" REF="220">
purpo&s;e to cheat his creditors, and he conceals
a part of his e&s;tate, when he &s;eems to offer a
&s;incere &s;urrender; if this be the ca&s;e, <HI>and it
can be made appear to be &s;o,</HI> for in &s;uch a ca&s;e too,
we ought to be very &s;ure of the fact, then in|deed
no favour is due, and really none ought
to be &s;hewed.</P>
<P>AND therefore it was a very righteous clau&s;e,
which was inflicted on the fraudulent bankrupt,
in a late Act of Parliament, namely, that in ca&s;e
he conceal'd his effects, and that it appear'd he
had, <HI>tho' upon his oath,</HI> not given in a full ac|count
of his e&s;tate, but willingly and knowingly
conceal'd it, or any part of it, with de&s;ign to
defraud his creditors, he &s;hould be put to death
<HI>as a felon:</HI> the rea&s;on, and ju&s;tice of which clau&s;e
was this, and it was given as the rea&s;on of it
when the Act was pa&s;s'd in the Hou&s;e of Com|mons,
namely, that the Act was made for the
relief of the debtor, as well as of the creditor,
and to procure for him a deliverance on a &s;ur|render
of his effects; but then it was made al|&s;o
for the relief of the creditor too, that he
might have as much of his debt &s;ecur'd to him
as po&s;&s;ible, and that he &s;hould not di&s;charge the
debtor with his e&s;tate in his pocket, &s;uffering
him to run away with his (the creditor's) mo|ney
before his face.</P>
<P>ALSO it was objected, that the act without
a penalty would be only an act to encourage
perjury, and would deliver the hard-mouth'd
knave that could &s;wear what he pleas'd and
ruin and reject the mode&s;t con&s;cientious trade&s;|man,
that was willing and ready to give up the
<PB N="202" REF="221">
utmo&s;t farthing to his creditors. On this ac|count
the clau&s;e was accepted, and the act
pa&s;s'd, which otherwi&s;e had been thrown out.</P>
<P>NOW when the poor in&s;olvent has thus &s;ur|rendred
his all, &s;tript him&s;elf entirely upon
oath, and that oath taken on the penalty of
death if it be fal&s;e; there &s;eems to be a kind of
ju&s;tice due to the bankrupt, he has &s;atisfy'd the
law, and ought to have his liberty given him
<HI>as a prey,</HI> as the text calls it, <HI>Jer.</HI> xxxix. 18.
that he may try the world once again, and &s;ee
if po&s;&s;ible to recover his di&s;a&s;ters, and get his
bread; and it is to be &s;poken in honour of
the ju&s;tice as well as humanity of that law for
delivering bankrupts, that there are more trade&s;|men
recover them&s;elves in this age upon their
&s;econd endeavours, and by &s;etting up again af|ter
they have thus fail'd, and been deliver'd,
than ever were known to do &s;o in ten times
the number of years before.</P>
<P>TO break, or turn bankrupt, before this, was
like a man being taken by the <HI>Turks,</HI> he &s;el|dom
recover'd liberty to try his fortune again,
but frequently langui&s;hed under the tyranny of
the commi&s;&s;ioners of bankrupt, or in the <HI>Mint,</HI>
or <HI>Fryers,</HI> or <HI>rules of the Fleet,</HI> till he wa&s;ted
the whole e&s;tate, and at length his life, and &s;o
his debts were all paid at once.</P>
<P>NOR was the ca&s;e of the creditor much bet|ter;
I mean as far as re&s;pected his debt, for it
was very &s;eldom that any con&s;iderable dividend
was made, on the other hand, large contribu|tions
were call'd for before people knew whe|ther
it was likely any thing would be made of
<PB N="203" REF="222">
the debtor's effects or no; and oftentimes the
creditor lo&s;t his whole debt, contribution-money
and all; &s;o that while the debtor was kept on
the rack, <HI>as above,</HI> being held in &s;u&s;pence by
the creditors, or by the commi&s;&s;ioners, or both,
he &s;pent the creditors effects, and &s;ub&s;i&s;ted at
their expence, till the e&s;tate being wa&s;ted, the
lo&s;s fell heavy on every &s;ide, and generally mo&s;t
on tho&s;e who were lea&s;t able to bear it.</P>
<P>BY the pre&s;ent &s;tate of things, this cvil is in|deed
altered, and the ruin of the creditors ef|fects
is better prevented; the bankrupt can no
more skulk behind the door of the <HI>Mint</HI> and
<HI>Rules,</HI> and prevent the commi&s;&s;ioners in&s;pecti|on;
he mu&s;t come forth, be examined, give in
an account, and &s;urrender him&s;elf and effects
too, or fly his country, and be &s;een here no
more; and if he does come in, he mu&s;t give a
full account upon oath, on the penalty of his
neck.</P>
<P>WHEN the effects are thus &s;urrendred, the
commi&s;&s;ioners proceedings are &s;hort and &s;um|mary;
the <HI>a&s;&s;ignees</HI> are obliged to make dividends,
and not detain the e&s;tate in their own hands, as
was the ca&s;e in former days, till &s;ometimes they
became bankrupts them&s;elves; &s;o that the cre|ditors
are &s;ure now what is put into the hands
of <HI>the a&s;&s;ignees,</HI> &s;hall in due time, and without
the u&s;ual delay, be fairly divided: on the other
hand, the poor debtor having hone&s;tly di&s;charg'd
his part, and no objection lying again&s;t the &s;in|cerity
of the di&s;covery, has a certificate granted
him, which being allowed by the Lord Chan|cellor,
he is a clear man, and may begin the
world again, as I have &s;aid above.</P>
<P><PB N="204" REF="223">
THE creditor being thus &s;atisfied that the
debtor has been faithful, does not an&s;wer the
end of the Act of Parliament, if he declines to
a&s;&s;ent to the debtor's certificate; nor can any
creditor decline it, but on principles which no
man cares to own; namely, that of malice, and
the highe&s;t re&s;entment; which are things a
chri&s;tian trade&s;man will not ea&s;ily act upon.</P>
<P>BUT I come now to the other part of the
ca&s;e; and this is &s;uppo&s;ing a debtor fails, and
the creditors do not think fit to take out a com|mi&s;&s;ion
of bankrupt again&s;t him, as &s;ometimes
is the ca&s;e, at lea&s;t, where they &s;ee the offers
of the debtor are any thing rea&s;onable: my ad|vice
in &s;uch ca&s;e is, (and I &s;peak it from long
experience in &s;uch things,) that they &s;hould always
accept the fir&s;t rea&s;onable propo&s;al of the
debtor; and I am not in this talking on the
foot of charity and mercy to the debtor, but
of the real and undoubted intere&s;t of the cre|ditor;
nor could I urge it, by &s;uch arguments
as I &s;hall bring, upon any other foundation;
for if I &s;peak in behalf of the debtor, I mu&s;t
argue commi&s;eration to the mi&s;erable, compa&s;|&s;ion
and pity of his family, and a reflection up|on
the &s;ad changes which human life expo&s;es
us all to, and &s;o per&s;uade the creditor to have
pity upon not him only, but upon all families in
di&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>BUT I &s;ay I argue now upon a different
foundation, and in&s;i&s;t that it is the creditor's
true intere&s;t, <HI>as I hinted before,</HI> that if he finds
the debtor inclin'd to be hone&s;t, and he &s;ees
rea&s;on to believe he makes the be&s;t offer he
<PB N="205" REF="224">
can; he &s;hould accept the fir&s;t offer, as being
generally the be&s;t the debtor can make; and in|deed,
if the debtor be wi&s;e as well as hone&s;t,
he will make it &s;o, and generally it is found
to be &s;o: and there are indeed many rea&s;ons
why the fir&s;t offers of the debtor are generally
the be&s;t, and why no commi&s;&s;ion of bankrupt
ordinarily rai&s;es &s;o much, not with&s;tanding all
its &s;everities, as the bankrupt offers before it is
&s;ued out; not reckoning the time and expence
which, <HI>notwith&s;tanding all the new methods,</HI>
attend &s;uch things, and are inevitable. <HI>For
example,</HI></P>
<P>WHEN the debtor fir&s;t <HI>looking into his affairs</HI>
&s;ees the nece&s;&s;ity coming upon him of making
a &s;top in trade, and calling his creditors toge|ther,
the fir&s;t thought which by the con&s;equene
of the thing comes to be con&s;idered, is, what
offers he can make to them to avoid the having
a commi&s;&s;ion &s;ued out again&s;t him, and to
which end common prudence, as well as hone&s;t
principles, moves him to make the be&s;t offers
he can. If he be a man of &s;en&s;e, and, accord|ing
to what I mentioned in my other letter,
has prudently come to a &s;top in time, before
things are run to extremities, and while he has
&s;omething left to make an offer of that may
be con&s;iderable, he will &s;eldom meet with cre|ditors
&s;o weak or &s;o blind to their own inte|re&s;t,
not to be willing to end it amicably, ra|ther
than to proceed to a commi&s;&s;ion. And as
this is certainly be&s;t both for the debtor and
the creditor; &s;o, as I argued with the debtor,
that he &s;hould be wi&s;e enough, as well as ho|ne&s;t
<PB N="206" REF="225">
enough to break betimes, and that it was
infinitely be&s;t for his own intere&s;t; &s;o I mu&s;t
add, on the other hand, to the creditor, that
'tis always his intere&s;t to accept the fir&s;t offer:
and I never knew a commi&s;&s;ion make more of
an e&s;tate where the debtor has been hone&s;t,
than he (the debtor) propo&s;ed to give them
without it.</P>
<P>IT is true, there are ca&s;es where the i&s;&s;uing
out a commi&s;&s;ion may be ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary.
<HI>For example,</HI></P>
<P>1. WHERE the debtor is evidently knavi&s;h,
and di&s;covers him&s;elf to be &s;o, by endeavours
to carry off his effects, or alter the property of
the e&s;tate confe&s;&s;ing judgments, or any the u|&s;ual
ways of fraud, which in &s;uch ca&s;es are or|dinarily
practi&s;ed. Or,</P>
<P>2. WHERE &s;ome creditors, by &s;uch judgments,
or by attachments of debts, goods delivered, ef|fects
made over, or any other way, have gotten
&s;ome of the e&s;tate into their hands, or &s;ecuri|ties
belonging to it, whereby they are in a bet|ter
&s;tate, as to payment, than the re&s;t. Or,</P>
<P>3. WHERE &s;ome people are brought in as
creditors, who&s;e debts there is rea&s;on to believe
are not real; but who place them&s;elves in the
room of creditors, in order to receive a divi|dend
for the u&s;e of the bankrupt, or &s;ome of
his family.</P>
<P>IN the&s;e <HI>and &s;uch like</HI> ca&s;es, a commi&s;&s;ion is
inevitable, and mu&s;t be taken out; nor does
the man merit to be regarded upon the foot of
what I call compa&s;&s;ion and commi&s;eration at
all; but ought to be treated like a rapparee or
<PB N="207" REF="226">
plunderer, who breaks with a de&s;ign to make
him&s;elf whole by the compo&s;ition; and as ma|ny
did formerly, who were beggars when they
broke, be made rich by the breach: It was to
provide again&s;t &s;uch harpyes as the&s;e, that the
Act of Parliament was made; and the only re|medy
again&s;t them is a commi&s;&s;ion, in which
the be&s;t thing they can do for their creditors,
is to come in and be examined, give in a fal&s;e
account upon oath, be di&s;covered, convicted of
it, and &s;ent to the gallows, as they de&s;erve.</P>
<P>BUT I am &s;peaking of hone&s;t men, the rever&s;e
of &s;uch thieves as the&s;e, who being brought
into di&s;tre&s;s by the ordinary calamities of trade,
are willing to do the utmo&s;t to &s;atisfy their cre|ditors:
when &s;uch as the&s;e break in the trade&s;|man's
debt, let him con&s;ider &s;eriou&s;ly my ad|vice,
and he &s;hall find, I might &s;ay he &s;hall <HI>al|ways</HI>
find, but I do affirm, he &s;hall <HI>generally</HI>
find the fir&s;t offer is the be&s;t, and that he will
never lo&s;e by accepting it: to refu&s;e it, is but
pu&s;hing the debtor to extremities, and running
out &s;ome of the effects to &s;ecure the re&s;t.</P>
<P>FIRST, as to collecting in the debts: &s;uppo&s;ing
the man is hone&s;t, and they can tru&s;t him, 'tis
evident no man can make &s;o much of them as
the bankrupt. (1.) He knows the circum&s;tances
of the debtors, and how be&s;t to manage them;
he knows who he may be&s;t pu&s;h at, and who
be&s;t forbear. (2.) He can do it with the lea&s;t
charge; the commi&s;&s;ioners or a&s;&s;ignees mu&s;t
employ other people, &s;uch as attorneys, &s;olli|citors,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> and they are paid dear; the bank|rupt
&s;its at home, and by letters into the coun|try,
<PB N="208" REF="227">
or by vi&s;iting them, if in town, can
make up every account, an&s;wer every objection,
judge of every &s;cruple, and, in a word, with
ea&s;e, <HI>compared to what others mu&s;t do,</HI> brings
them to comply.</P>
<P>NEXT, as to &s;elling off a &s;tock of goods;
the bankrupt keeps open the &s;hop, di&s;per&s;es or
di&s;po&s;es of the goods with advantage; whereas
the commi&s;&s;ion brings all to a &s;ale, or an out|cry,
or an apprai&s;ement, and all finks the value
of the &s;tock; &s;o that the bankrupt can certain|ly
make more of the &s;tock than any other per|&s;on,
(always provided he is hone&s;t, as I &s;aid be|fore,)
and much more than the creditors can
do.</P>
<P>FOR the&s;e rea&s;ons, and many others, the bank|rupt
is able to make a better offer upon his e|&s;tate
than the creditors can expect to rai&s;e any
other way; and therefore 'tis their intere&s;t al|ways
to take the fir&s;t offer, if they are &s;atisfied
there is no fraud in it, and that the man has
offered any thing near the extent of what he
has left in the world to offer from.</P>
<P>IF then it be the trade&s;man's intere&s;t to ac|cept
of the offer made, there needs no &s;tronger
argument to be u&s;ed with him for the doing it;
and nothing is more &s;urpri&s;ing <HI>to me</HI> than to
&s;ee trade&s;men the harde&s;t to come into &s;uch
compo&s;itions, and to pu&s;h on &s;everities again&s;t
other trade&s;men, as if they were out of the
reach of the &s;hocks of fortune them&s;elves, or
that it was impo&s;&s;ible for them ever to &s;tand in
need of the &s;ame mercy; the contrary to which
I have often &s;een.</P>
<P><PB N="209" REF="228">
TO what purpo&s;e &s;hould trade&s;men pu&s;h things
to extremities again&s;t trade&s;men, if nothing is
to be gotten by it, and if the in&s;olvent trade&s;|man
will take proper mea&s;ures to convince the
creditor that his intentions are hone&s;t? The law
was made for offenders; there needs no law for
innocent men: commi&s;&s;ions are granted to ma|nage
knaves, and hamper and entangle cunning
de&s;igning Rogues, who &s;eek to rai&s;e fortunes out
of their creditors e&s;tates, and exalt them&s;elves
by their own downfal; they are not de&s;ign'd
again&s;t hone&s;t men, neither indeed is there any
need of them for &s;uch.</P>
<P>LET no man mi&s;take this part therefore, and
think that I am moving trade&s;men to be ea&s;y
and compa&s;&s;ionate to Rogues and cheats; I am
far from it, and have given &s;ufficient te&s;timony
of the contrary; having, I a&s;&s;ure you, been the
only per&s;on who actually form'd, drew up, and
fir&s;t propo&s;ed that very clau&s;e to the Hou&s;e of
Commons, which made it felony to the bank|rupt
to give in a fal&s;e account. It cannot
therefore be &s;ugge&s;ted without manife&s;t inju&s;tice,
that I would with one breath prompt creditors
to be ea&s;y to Rogues, and to cheating fraudu|lent
bankrupts, and with another make a pro|po&s;al
to have them hang'd.</P>
<P>BUT I move the creditor on account of his
own intere&s;t, always to take the fir&s;t offer, if he
&s;ees no palpable fraud in it, or &s;ees no rea&s;on
to &s;u&s;pect &s;uch fraud; and my rea&s;on is good,
<HI>viz.</HI> becau&s;e I believe, <HI>as I &s;aid before,</HI> 'tis ge|nerally
the be&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="210" REF="229">
I know there is a new method of putting an
end to a trade&s;man's troubles, by that which
was formerly thought the greate&s;t of all trou|bles;
I mean, a fraudulent method, or what they
call taking our friendly &s;tatutes; that is, when
trade&s;men get &s;tatutes taken out again&s;t them|&s;elves,
mov'd fir&s;t by &s;ome per&s;on in kindne&s;s
to them, and done at the reque&s;t of the bank|rupt
him&s;elf; this is generally done when the
circum&s;tances of the debtor are very low, and
he has little or nothing to &s;urrender; and the
end is, that the creditors may be obliged to take
what there is, and the man may get a full di&s;|charge.</P>
<P>THIS is indeed a vile corruption of a good
law, and turning the edge of the act again&s;t the
creditor, not again&s;t the debtor; and as he has
nothing to &s;urrender, they get little or nothing,
and the man is as effectually di&s;charged as if he
had paid twenty &s;hillings in the pound; and
&s;o he is in a condition to &s;et up again, take
fre&s;h credit, break again, and have another com|mi&s;&s;ion
again&s;t him; and &s;o round, as often as
he thinks fit. This indeed is a fraud upon the
act, and &s;hews that all human wi&s;dom is im|perfect,
that the law wants &s;ome repairs, and
that it will in time come into con&s;ideration a|gain,
to be made capable of di&s;appointing the
people that intend to make &s;uch u&s;e of it.</P>
<P>I think there is al&s;o wanting a law again&s;t
twice breaking, and that all &s;econd commi&s;&s;ions
&s;hould have &s;ome penalty upon the bankrupt,
and a third a farther penalty, and if the fourth
brought the man to the gallows, it could not
<PB N="211" REF="230">
be thought hard; for he that has &s;et up and
broke, and &s;et up again, and broke again, and
the like, a third time, I think merits to be hang'd,
if he pretends to venture any more.</P>
<P>MOST of tho&s;e crimes again&s;t which any
laws are publi&s;h'd in particular, and which are
not capital, have generally an addition of pu|ni&s;hment
upon a repetition of the crime; and
&s;o on, a farther puni&s;hment to a farther repe|tition;
I do not &s;ee why it &s;hould not be &s;o
here; and I doubt not but it would have a
good effect upon trade&s;men, to make them cau|tious,
and to warn them to avoid &s;uch &s;can|dalous
doings as we &s;ee daily practi&s;ed, breaking
three or four, or five times over; and we &s;ee
in&s;tances of &s;ome &s;uch while I am writing this
very letter.</P>
<P>TO &s;uch therefore I am &s;o far from moving
for any favour, either from the law, or from
their creditors, that I think the only deficiency
of the law at this time is, that it does not reach
to inflict a corporal puni&s;hment in &s;uch a ca&s;e;
but leaves &s;uch in&s;olvents to fare well in com|mon
with tho&s;e who&s;e di&s;a&s;ters are greater, and
who being hone&s;t and con&s;cientious, merit more
favour, but do not often find it.</P>

he <HI>mu&s;t break;</HI> that he does but go backward
more and more, and that the longer he holds
out, he &s;hall have the le&s;s to offer, and be the
harder thought of, as well as the harder dealt
with; re&s;olves to call his creditors together in
time, while there is &s;omething con&s;iderable to
offer them, and while he may have &s;ome ju&s;t

<P><PB N="213" REF="232">
<HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> HE a&s;&s;ures them that he has not wa&s;ted

hone&s;t, and allowing that the &s;tate of
his account comes out &s;o well as to pay fifteen
&s;hillings in the pound, what and who but a par|cel

&s;uch a man? what would they be call'd, nay,
what would they &s;ay of them&s;elves, if they
&s;hould reject &s;uch a compo&s;ition, and &s;hould go
and take out a commi&s;&s;ion of bankrupt again&s;t
&s;uch a man? I never knew but one of the like
circum&s;tances, that was refus'd by his creditors;

<P>THIS account is drawn out to &s;atisfy him|&s;elf
how his condition &s;tands, and what it is
he ought to do: upon the &s;tating which account
he &s;ees to his affliction that he has &s;unk all
his own fortune and his wife's, and is a thou|sand
pound wor&s;e than nothing in the world;
<PB N="217" REF="236">
and that being obliged to live in the &s;ame hou&s;e,
for the &s;ake of his bu&s;ine&s;s and warehou&s;e, tho'
the rent is too great for him, his trade being
declin'd, his credit &s;unk, and his family be|ing
large, he &s;ees evidently he cannot go on,
and that it will only be bringing things from
bad to wor&s;e; and above all the re&s;t being great|ly
perplexed in his mind, that he is &s;pending o|ther
peoples e&s;tates, and that the bread he eats
is not his own, he re&s;olves to call his creditors
all together, lay before them the true &s;tate of
his ca&s;e, and lie at their mercy for the re&s;t.</P>
<P>THE account of his pre&s;ent and pa&s;t fortune
&s;tanding as it did, and <HI>as appears above,</HI> the
re&s;ult is as follows, namely, That he has not
&s;ufficient to pay all his creditors, tho' his debts
&s;hould prove to be all good, and the goods in
his warehou&s;e &s;hould be fully worth the price
they co&s;t, which being liable to daily contin|gencies,
add to the rea&s;ons which pre&s;s'd him
before to make an offer of &s;urrender to his cre|ditors
both of his goods and debts, and to give
up all into their hands.</P>

<P>THIS amounts to fifteen &s;hillings in the pound
upon all his debts; which if the creditors plea&s;e
to appoint an a&s;&s;ignee, or tru&s;tee to &s;ell the
goods, and collect the debts, he is willing to
&s;urrender wholly into their hands, hoping they
will as a favour give him his hou&s;hold-goods,
as in the account, for his family-u&s;e, and his-li|berty,
that he may &s;eek out for &s;ome employ|ment
to get his bread.</P>
<P>THE account being thus clear, the books ex|actly
agreeing, and the man appearing to have
acted openly and fairly, the creditors meet, and
after a few con&s;ultations agree to accept his pro|po&s;als,
and the man is a freeman immediately,
gets fre&s;h credit, opens his &s;hop again, and dou|bling
his vigilance and application in bu&s;ine&s;s,
he recovers in a few years, grows rich; then
like an hone&s;t man &s;till, he calls all his creditors
together again, tells them he does not call them
now to a &s;econd compo&s;ition, but to tell them,
that having with God's ble&s;&s;ing and his own in|du&s;try
gotten enough to enable him, he was
re&s;olv'd to pay them the remainder of his old
debt; and accordingly does &s;o, to the great
joy of his creditors, to his own very great ho|nour,
and to the encouragement of all hone&s;t
men to take the &s;ame mea&s;ures: It is true, this
does not often happen, but there have been in|&s;tances
<PB N="219" REF="238">
of it, and I could name &s;everal within
my own knowledge.</P>
<P>BUT here comes an objection in the way, <HI>as
follows:</HI> It is true, this man did very hone&s;tly,
and his creditors had a great deal of rea&s;on to
be &s;atisfied with his ju&s;t dealing with them; but
is every man bound thus to &s;trip him&s;elf naked?
perhaps this man at the &s;ame time had a family
to maintain, and had he no debt of ju&s;tice to
them, but to beg his hou&s;hold-goods back of
them for his poor family, and that as an alms?
and would he not have fared as well, if he had
offer'd his creditors ten &s;hillings in the pound,
and took all the re&s;t upon him&s;elf? and then he
had re&s;erv'd to him&s;elf &s;ufficient to have &s;upport|ed
him&s;elf in any new undertaking.</P>
<P>THE an&s;wer to this is &s;hort and plain, and
no debtor can be at a lo&s;s to know his way in
it; for otherwi&s;e people may make difficulties
where there are none; the ob&s;erving the &s;trict
rules of ju&s;tice and hone&s;ty will chalk out his
way for him.</P>
<P>THE man being deficient in &s;tock, and his e|&s;tate
run out to a thou&s;and pounds wor&s;e than
nothing, by his lo&s;&s;es, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> 'tis evident all he has
left is the proper e&s;tate of his creditors, and he
has no right to one &s;hilling of it; he owes it
them, 'tis a ju&s;t debt to them, and he ought to
di&s;charge it fairly, by giving up all into their
hands, or at lea&s;t to offer to do &s;o.</P>
<P>BUT to put the ca&s;e upon a new foot; as he
is obliged to make an offer, as above, to put
all his effects, books, and goods into their power,
&s;o he may add an alternative to them thus,
<PB N="220" REF="239">
<HI>viz.</HI> That if on the other hand they do not
think proper to take the trouble, or run the
ri&s;que of collecting the debts, and &s;elling the
goods, which may be difficult; if they will
leave it to him to do it, he will undertake to
pay them&mdash;&s;hillings in the pound, and &s;tand
to the hazard both of debts and goods.</P>
<P>HAVING thus offer'd the creditors their choice,
if they accept the propo&s;al of a certain &s;um, as
&s;ometimes I know they have cho&s;en to do, ra|ther
than to have the trouble of making a&s;&s;ignees,
and run the hazard of the debts, when put in $o
lawyer's hands to collect, and of the goods, to
fell them by apprai&s;ement; if I &s;ay they choo&s;e
this, and offer to di&s;charge the debtor upon
payment, &s;uppo&s;e it be of ten or twelve &s;hil|lings
in the pound in money, within a certain
time, or on giving &s;ecurity for the payment:
then indeed the debtor is di&s;charged in con&s;ci|ence,
and may lawfully and hone&s;tly take the
remainder, as a gift given him by his creditors
for undertaking their bu&s;ine&s;s, or &s;ecuring the
remainder of their debt to them; I &s;ay, the
debtor may do this with the utmo&s;t &s;atisfaction
to his con&s;cience.</P>
<P>BUT without thus putting it into the credit|ors
choice, 'tis a force upon them to offer them
any thing le&s;s than the utmo&s;t farthing that he
is able to pay; and particularly to pretend to
make an offer, as if it was his utmo&s;t, and, as is
u&s;ual, make prote&s;tations that it is the mo&s;t he
is able to pay; (indeed every offer of$ a compo|&s;ition
is a kind of prote&s;tation that the debtor
is not able to pay any more) I &s;ay to offer thus,
<PB N="221" REF="240">
and declare he offers as much as po&s;&s;ible, and
as much as the effects he has left will produce,
if his effects are able to produce more, he is then
a cheat; for he acts then like one that &s;tands
at Bay with his creditors, makes an offer, and if
the creditors do not think fit to accept of it,
they mu&s;t take what methods they think they
can take to get more: that is to &s;ay, he bids
open defiance to their &s;tatutes and commi&s;&s;ions
of bankrupt, and any other proceedings; like a
town be&s;ieged, which offers to capitulate and
to yield upon &s;uch and &s;uch articles; which im|plies,
that if tho&s;e articles are not accepted, the
garri&s;on will defend them&s;lves to the la&s;t ex|tremity,
and do all the mi&s;chief to the a&s;&s;ail|ants
that they can.</P>
<P>NOW this in a garri&s;on-town, <HI>I &s;ay,</HI> may be
lawful and fair, but in a debtor to his creditor
it is quite another thing: for, <HI>as I have &s;aid
above,</HI> the debtor has no property in the effects
which he has in his hands; they are the goods
and e&s;tate of the creditor; and to hold out a|gain&s;t
the creditor, keep his e&s;tate by violence,
and make him accept of a &s;mall part of it, when
the debtor has a larger part in his power, and
is able to give it; this is not fair, much le&s;s is
it hone&s;t and con&s;cientious: but 'tis &s;till wor&s;e
to do this, and at the &s;ame time to declare that
it is the utmo&s;t the debtor can do; this, I &s;ay,
is &s;till more di&s;hone&s;t, becau&s;e it is not true,
and is adding fal&s;hood to the other inju&s;tice.</P>
<P>THUS I think I have &s;tated the ca&s;e clearly
for the conduct of the debtor; and indeed, this
way of laying all before the creditors, and put|ting
<PB N="222" REF="241">
it into their choice &s;eems a very happy me|thod
for the comfort of the debtor, ca&s;t down
and dejected with the weight of his circum&s;tan|ces;
and, <HI>it may be,</HI> with the reproaches of his
own con&s;cience <HI>too,</HI> that he has not done ho|ne&s;tly
in running out the effects of his creditors,
and making other families &s;uffer by him, and
<HI>perhaps poor families too;</HI> I &s;ay, this way of giv|ing
up all with an hone&s;t and &s;ingle de&s;ire to
make all the &s;atisfaction he is able to his cre|ditors,
greatly heals the breach in his peace,
which his circum&s;tances had made before; for
by now doing all that is in his power, he makes
all po&s;&s;ible amends for what is pa&s;t, I mean as
to men; and they are induc'd by this open frank
u&s;age to give him the reward of his hone&s;ty,
and freely forgive him the re&s;t of the debt.</P>
<P>THERE is a manife&s;t difference to the debtor
in point of con&s;cience, between &s;urrendring his
whole effects, or e&s;tate, to his creditors for &s;a|tisfaction
of their debts, and offering them a
compo&s;ition; unle&s;s, as I have &s;aid, the compo|&s;ition
is offer'd, as above, to the choice of the
creditor: By &s;urrendring the whole e&s;tate, the
debtor acknowledges the creditors right to all
he has in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and gives it up to them
as their own, putting it in their full power to
di&s;po&s;e of it as they plea&s;e.</P>
<P>BUT by a compo&s;ition the debtor, as <HI>I have
&s;aid above,</HI> &s;tands at Bay with the creditors, and
keeping their e&s;tates in his hands, capitulates
with them, as it were, &s;word in hand, telling
them he can give them no more; when perhaps,
<HI>and too often it is the ca&s;e,</HI> 'tis apparent that he
<PB N="223" REF="242">
is in condition to offer more. Now let the cre|ditors
confent to the&s;e propo&s;als, be what it
will, and however voluntary it may be pretend|ed
to be, 'tis evident, that a force is the occa|&s;ion
of it, and the creditor complies, and ac|cepts
the propo&s;al, upon the &s;uppo&s;ition that no
better conditions can be had; 'tis the plain lan|guage
of the thing; for no man accepts of le&s;s
than he thinks he can get; if he believ'd he
could have more, he would certainly get it if
he could.</P>
<P>AND if the debtor is able to pay one &s;hilling
more than he offers, 'tis a cheat, a palpable
fraud, and of &s;o much he actually robs his cre|ditor;
but in a &s;urrender the ca&s;e is alter'd in
all its parts; the debtor &s;ays to his creditors,
Gentlemen, there is a full and faithful account
of all I have left; 'tis your own, <HI>and there it
is;</HI> I am ready to put it into your hands, or in|to
the hands of whom&s;oever you &s;hall appoint
to receive it, and to lie at your mercy: this is
all the man is able to do, and therefore is &s;o
far hone&s;t, whether the methods that reduc'd
him were hone&s;t, or no; that's a que&s;tion by
it&s;elf. If on this &s;urrender he finds the credit|ors
de&s;irous, rather to have it dige&s;ted into a
compo&s;ition, and that they will voluntarily come
into &s;uch a propo&s;al; then, as above, they be|ing
judges of the equity of the compo&s;ition, and
of what ability the debtor is to perform it; and
<HI>above all,</HI> of what he may or may not gain by
it; if they accept of &s;uch a compo&s;ition, in|&s;tead
of the &s;urrender of his effects, then the
ca&s;e alters entirely, and the debtor is acquitted
<PB N="224" REF="243">
in con&s;cience, becau&s;e the creditor had a fair
choice, and the compo&s;ition is rather their pro|po&s;al
to the debtor, than the debtor's propo&s;al
to them.</P>
<P>THUS I think I have &s;tated the ca&s;e of ju&s;tice
and con&s;cience on the debtor's behalf, and clear'd
up his way, in ca&s;e of a nece&s;&s;ity, to &s;top tra|ding,
that he may break without wounding his
con&s;cience, as well as his fortunes; and he that
thinks fit to act thus, will come off with the
reputation of an hone&s;t man, and will have the
favour of his creditors to begin again, with
whatever he may have as to &s;tock; and &s;ome|times
that favour is better to him than a &s;tock,
and has been the rai&s;ing of many a broken trade&s;|man,
&s;o that his latter end has been better than
his beginning.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of Trade&s;men ruining one another by
Rumour and Clamour, by Scandal and
Reproach.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_I Have dwelt long upon the trade&s;man's
management of him&s;elf, in order to
his due pre&s;erving both his bu&s;ine&s;s
and his reputation: let me be&s;tow
one letter upon the trade&s;man for his conduct
among his neighbours and fellow-trade&s;men.</P>
<P>CREDIT is &s;o much a trade&s;man's ble&s;&s;ing, that
'tis the choice&s;t ware he deals in, and he cannot
be too chary of it when he has it, or buy it
too dear when he wants it; 'tis a &s;tock to his
warehou&s;e; 'tis current money in his ca&s;h-che&s;t;
it accepts all his bills; for 'tis on the fund of
his credit that he has any bills to accept; de|mands
would el&s;e be all made upon the &s;pot,
and he mu&s;t pay for his goods before he has
them; therefore I &s;ay it accepts all his bills, and
oftentimes pays them too: in a word, 'tis the
life and &s;oul of his trade, and it requires his
utmo&s;t vigilance to pre&s;erve it.</P>
<P>IF then his own credit &s;hould be of &s;o much
value to him, and he &s;hould be &s;o nice in his
<PB N="226" REF="245">
concern about it, he ought in &s;ome degree to
have the &s;ame care of his neighbour's: Religion
teaches us not to &s;lander and de&s;ame our neigh|bour,
that is to &s;ay, not to rai&s;e or promote
any &s;lander or &s;candal upon his good name: As
a good name is to another man, and which,
the Wi&s;eman &s;ays, <HI>is better than life,</HI> the &s;ame
is credit to a trade&s;man; it is the life of his
trade; and he that wounds a trade&s;man's credit,
without cau&s;e, is as much a murtherer in trade,
as he that kills a man in the dark is a murtherer
in matters of blood.</P>
<P>BESIDES, there is a particular nicety in the
credit of a trade&s;man, which does not reach
in other ca&s;es: a man is &s;lander'd in his chara|cter,
or reputation, and 'tis injurious; and if it
comes in the way of a marriage, or of a pre|ferment,
or po&s;t, it may di&s;appoint and ruin
him; but if this happens to a trade&s;man, he is
immediately and unavoidably bla&s;ted, and un|done:
a trade&s;man has but two &s;orts of enemies
to encounter with, <HI>viz.</HI> Thieves breaking open
his &s;hop, and ill neighbours blackning and bla&s;t|ing
his reputation; and the latter are the wor&s;t
Thieves of the two, by a great deal; and there|fore
people &s;hould indeed be more chary of
their di&s;cour&s;e of trade&s;men, than of other men,
and that as they would not be guilty of mur|ther.</P>
<P>I knew an author of a book, who was drawn
in unwarily, and without de&s;ign, to publi&s;h a
&s;candalous &s;tory of a trade&s;man in <HI>London:</HI> He
(the author) was impos'd upon in it by a &s;et of
men, who did it maliciou&s;ly, and he was ut|terly
<PB N="227" REF="246">
ignorant of the wicked de&s;ign; nor did he
know the per&s;on, but ra&s;hly publi&s;h'd the thing,
being him&s;elf too fond of a piece of news,
which he thought would be grateful to his read|ers:
nor yet did he publi&s;h the per&s;on's name,
&s;o cautious he was; tho' that was not enough
as it prov'd; for the per&s;on was pre&s;ently pub|li&s;h'd
by tho&s;e who had maliciou&s;ly done it.</P>
<P>THE &s;candal &s;pread; the trade&s;man, a flou|ri&s;hing
man, and a con&s;iderable dealer, was run
upon by it with a torrent of malice; a match
which he was about with a con&s;iderable fortune
was bla&s;ted and prevented, and that indeed was
the malicious end of the people that did it; nor
did it &s;top there; it brought his creditors upon
him, it ruin'd him, it brought out a commi&s;&s;i|on
of bankrupt again&s;t him, it broke his heart,
and kill'd him; and after his death his debts and
effects coming in, there appear'd to be &s;even
&s;hillings in the pound e&s;tate, clear and good over
and above all demands, all his debts di&s;charg'd,
and all the expences of the &s;tatute paid.</P>
<P>IT was to no purpo&s;e that the man purg'd
him&s;elf of the crime laid to his charge; that
the author, who had ignorantly and ra&s;hly pub|li&s;h'd
the &s;candal, declar'd him&s;elf ignorant; the
man was run down by a torrent of reproach;
&s;candal oppre&s;s'd him; he was buried alive in
the noi&s;e and du&s;t rais'd both again&s;t his morals
and his credit, and yet his character was prov'd
good, and his bottom in trade was &s;o too, as I
have &s;aid above.</P>
<P>IT is not the lea&s;t rea&s;on of my publi&s;hing
this to add, that even the per&s;on who was igno|rantly
<PB N="228" REF="247">
made the in&s;trument of publi&s;hing the
&s;candal, was not able to retrieve it, or to pre|vent
the man's ruin by all the publick repara|tion
he could make in print, and by all the ac|knowledgment
he could make of his having
been ignorantly drawn in to do it. And this
I mention for the hone&s;t trade&s;man's caution,
and to put him in mind, that when he has un|warily
let &s;lip any thing to the wounding the
reputation of his neighbour trade&s;man, whether
in his trading credit, or the credit of his morals,
it may not be in his power to un&s;ay it again;
<HI>that is,</HI> &s;o as to prevent the ruin of the per&s;on;
and tho' it may grieve him as long as he lives,
as the like did the author I mention, yet 'tis
not in his power to recall it, or to heal the
wound he has given; and that he &s;hould con&s;i|der
very well of beforehand.</P>
<P>A trade&s;man's credit and a virgin's virtue, ought
to be equally &s;acred from the tongues of men;
and 'tis a very unhappy truth, that as times now

<P>THE Tea-table among the Ladies, and the Cof|fee-hou&s;e
among the men, &s;eem to be places
of new invention for a depravation of our
manners and morals; places devoted to &s;can|dal,
and where the characters of all kinds of
per&s;ons and profe&s;&s;ions are handled in the mo&s;t
mercile&s;s manner; where reproach triumphs,
and we &s;eem to give our &s;elves a loo&s;e to $all
upon one another in the mo&s;t unchri&s;tian and
unfriendly manner in the world.</P>
<P><PB N="229" REF="248">
IT &s;eems a little hard that the reputation of
a young Lady, or of a new-married couple, or
of people in the mo&s;t critical &s;ea&s;on of e&s;tabli&s;h|ing
the characters of their per&s;ons and families,
&s;hould lie at the mercy of the Tea-table: nor is
it le&s;s hard, that the credit of a trade&s;man,
which is the &s;ame thing in its nature as the
virtue of a Lady, &s;hould be to&s;&s;ed about, &s;huttle|cock
like, from one table to another in the
coffee-hou&s;e, till they &s;hall talk all his creditors
about his ears, and bring him to the very mi&s;|fortune
which they reported him to be near;
when at the &s;ame time he ow'd them nothing
who rais'd the clamour, and ow'd nothing to all
the world, but what he was able to pay.</P>
<P>AND yet how many trade&s;men have been thus
undone, and how many more have been put
to the full trial of their &s;trength in trade, and
have &s;tood by the mere force of their good cir|cum&s;tances?
whereas had they been unfurni&s;h'd
with ca&s;h to have an&s;wered their whole debts,
they mu&s;t have fallen with the re&s;t.</P>
<P>WE need go no farther than <HI>Lombard-&s;treet</HI>
for an exemplification of this truth; there was
a time when <HI>Lombard-&s;treet</HI> was the only <HI>Bank,</HI>
and the gold&s;mith's there were all called Bankers;
the credit of their bu&s;ine&s;s was &s;uch, that the
like has not been &s;een in <HI>England</HI> &s;ince, in
private hands; &s;ome of tho&s;e Bankers, as I have
had from their own mouths, have had near two
millions of paper credit upon them at a time;
that is to &s;ay, have had bills under their hands
running abroad for &s;o much at a time.</P>
<P><PB N="230" REF="249">
ON a &s;udden, like a clap of thunder, King
<HI>Charles</HI> II. &s;hut up the <HI>Exchequer,</HI> which was
the common center of the overplus ca&s;h the&s;e
great Bankers had in their hands; what was the
con&s;equence? Not only the Bankers who had
the bulk of their ca&s;h there, but all <HI>Lombard-&s;treet</HI>
&s;tood &s;till; the very report of having mo|ney
in the <HI>Exchequer</HI> brought a run upon the
gold&s;miths that had no money there, as well as
upon tho&s;e that had; and not only Sir <HI>Robert
Viner,</HI> Alderman <HI>Backwell, Farringdon, Forth</HI>
and others, broke and fail'd, but &s;everal were
ruin'd who had not a penny of money in the
<HI>Exchequer,</HI> and only &s;unk by the rumour of it;
that rumour bringing a run upon the whole &s;treet,
and giving a check to the paper credit that was
run up to &s;uch an exorbitant height.</P>
<P>I remember a &s;hop-keeper who one time took
the liberty (<HI>fooli&s;h liberty!</HI>) with him&s;elf, in pub|lick
company in a coffee-hou&s;e, to &s;ay that <HI>he
was broke;</HI> I a&s;&s;ure you, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> that I am broke,
and to morrow I re&s;olve to &s;hut up my &s;hop,
and call my creditors together. His meaning
was, that he had a brother ju&s;t dead in his hou&s;e,
and the next day was to be buried, when in
civility to the decea&s;ed, he kept his &s;hop &s;hut,
and &s;everal people whom he dealt with, and
ow'd money to, were the next day invited to
the funeral; &s;o that he did actually &s;hut up his
&s;hop, and call &s;ome of his creditors together.</P>
<P>BUT he &s;orely repented the je&s;t which he put
upon him&s;elf. Are you broke? &s;ays one of his
friends to him, that was in the coffee-hou&s;e,
then I wi&s;h I had the little money you owe me;
<PB N="231" REF="250">
(which however, it &s;eems, was not much;) &s;ays
the other, &s;till carrying on his je&s;t, I &s;hall pay
no body, till, as I told you, I have called my
people together. The other did not reach his
je&s;t, which at be&s;t was but a dull one, but he
reach'd that part of it that concern'd him&s;elf,
and &s;eeing him continue carele&s;ly &s;itting in the
&s;hop, &s;lipt out and fetch'd a couple of &s;ergeants,
and arre&s;ted him. The other was a little &s;ur|priz'd;
but however, the debt being no great
&s;um, he paid it, and when he found his mi&s;|take
told his friends what he meant by his be|ing
broke.</P>
<P>BUT it did not end there; for other people
of his neighbours who were then in the coffee-hou&s;e,
and heard his di&s;cour&s;e, and had thought
nothing more of it, yet in the morning &s;eeing
his &s;hop &s;hut, concluded the thing was &s;o in|deed;
and immediately it went over the whole
&s;treet, that &s;uch a one was broke; from thence
it went to the <HI>Exchange,</HI> and from thence in|to
the country, among all his dealers, who came
up in a throng and a fright to look after him;
In a word, he had as much to do to prevent
his breaking, as any man need to de&s;ire; and if
he had not had very good friends, as well as a
very good bottom, he had inevitably been ruin'd
and undone.</P>
<P>SO &s;mall a rumour will over-&s;et a trade&s;man,
if he is not very careful of him&s;elf; and if a
word in je&s;t from him&s;elf, which tho' indeed
no man that had con&s;idered things, or thought
before he &s;poke, would have &s;aid; (and on the
other hand, no man who had been wi&s;e and
<PB N="232" REF="251">
thinking would have taken as it was taken); I
&s;ay, if a word taken from the trade&s;man's own
mouth cou'd be &s;o fatal, and run &s;uch a dan|gerous
length, what may not words &s;poken &s;ly|ly,
and &s;ecretly, and maliciou&s;ly, be made to
do?</P>
<P>A trade&s;man's reputation is of the nice&s;t na|ture
imaginable, like a blite upon a fine flower,
if it is but toucht, the beauty of it, or the fla|vour
of it, or the &s;eed of it is lo&s;t, tho' the
noxious breath which toucht it might not reach
to bla&s;t the leaf, or hurt the root; the credit of
a trade&s;man, at lea&s;t in his beginning, is too
much at the mercy of every enemy he has, till
it has taken root, and is e&s;tabli&s;hed on a &s;olid
foundation of good conduct and &s;ucce&s;s. 'Tis
a &s;ad truth, that every idle tongue can bla&s;t a
young &s;hop-keeper; and therefore, tho' I wou'd
not di&s;courage any young beginner, yet it is
highly beneficial to alarm them, and to let them
know that they mu&s;t expect a &s;torm of &s;candal
and reproach upon the lea&s;t &s;lip they make: if
they but &s;tumble, &s;ame will throw them down;
'tis true, if they recover, &s;he will &s;et them up
as fa&s;t; but malice generally runs before, and
bears down all with it; and there are ten trade&s;|men
who fall under the weight of &s;lander and
an ill tongue, to one that is lifted up again by
the common hurry of report.</P>
<P>TO &s;ay I am broke, or in danger of break|ing,
is to break me: and tho' &s;ometimes the
malicious occa&s;ion is di&s;covered, and the author
detected and expo&s;ed; yet how &s;eldom is it &s;o?
and how much oftner are ill reports rais'd to
<PB N="233" REF="252">
ruin and run down a trade&s;man, and the credit
of a &s;hop? and like an arrow that flies in the
dark, it wounds un&s;een. The authors, no nor
the occa&s;ion of the&s;e reports, are never di&s;co|ver'd
perhaps, or &s;o much as rightly gue&s;s'd at;
and the poor trade&s;man feels the wound, re|ceives
the deadly blow, and is perhaps mortally
&s;tabb'd in the vitals of his trade, I mean his
trading credit, and never knows who hurt him.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t &s;ay, in the trade&s;man's behalf, that he
is in &s;uch a ca&s;e to be e&s;teemed a &s;acrifice to the
wor&s;t and mo&s;t helli&s;h of all &s;ecret crimes, I
mean envy; which is of the Devil, was born of
Hell, and is made up of every hateful vice, a
complication of crimes which nothing but the
wor&s;t of God's rea&s;onable world can be guilty
of; and he will indeed merit and call for every
hone&s;t man's pity and concern; But what relief
is this to him? for in the mean time, tho' the
Devil him&s;elf were the rai&s;er of the &s;candal,
nay, tho' a vi&s;ible apparition from Hell it &s;elf
openly and avowedly carried the report about,
yet it &s;hall go about; the blow &s;hall take, and
every man, tho' at the &s;ame time expre&s;&s;ing
their horror and aver&s;ion at the thing, &s;hall yet
not be able, no not them&s;elves, to &s;ay they re|ceive
no impre&s;&s;ion from it.</P>
<P>THO' I know the clamour or rumour was rai&s;|ed
maliciou&s;ly, and from a &s;ecret envy at the
pro&s;perity of the man; yet if I deal with him,
it will in &s;pite of all my abhorrence of the
thing, in &s;pite of all my willingne&s;s to do ju&s;|tice,
I &s;ay it will have &s;ome little impre&s;&s;ion
upon me, it will be &s;ome &s;hock to my confi|dence
<PB N="234" REF="253">
in the man; and tho' I know the Devil is
a Liar, a Slanderer, a Calumniator, and that his
name <HI>Devil</HI> is derived from it; and that I knew,
<HI>if that,</HI> as I &s;aid, <HI>were po&s;&s;ible,</HI> that the Devil in
his proper per&s;on rais'd and begun, and carried
on this &s;candal upon the trade&s;man, yet there
is a &s;ecret lurking doubt (about him), which
hangs about me concerning him; the Devil is a
Liar, but he may happen to &s;peak truth ju&s;t
then, he may chance to be right, and I know
not what there may be in it, and whether there
may be any thing or no, but I will have a little
care, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>THUS in&s;en&s;ibly and involuntarily, nay, in
&s;pite of friend&s;hip, good wi&s;hes, and even re|&s;olution
to the contrary, 'tis almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible
to prevent our being &s;hockt by rumour, and we
receive an impre&s;&s;ion whether we will or not,
and that from the wor&s;t enemy; there is &s;uch a
powerful &s;ympathy between our thoughts and
our intere&s;t, that the fir&s;t being but toucht, and
that in the lighte&s;t manner imaginable, we can|not
help it, caution &s;teps on in behalf of the
la&s;t, and the man is jealous and afraid, in &s;pite
of all the kinde&s;t and be&s;t intentions in the
world.</P>
<P>NOR is it only dangerous in ca&s;e of fal&s;e ac|cu&s;ations,
and fal&s;e charges, for tho&s;e indeed are
to be expected fatal; but even ju&s;t and true
things may be as fatal as fal&s;e, for the truth is
not always nece&s;&s;ary to be &s;aid of a trade&s;man:
many things a trade&s;man may perhaps allow
him&s;elf to do, and may be lawfully done, but
if they &s;hould be known to be part of his cha|racter,
<PB N="235" REF="254">
it would &s;ink deep into his trading &s;ame,
his credit would &s;uffer by it, and in the end it
might be his ruin; &s;o that he that would not
&s;et his hand to his neighbour's ruin, &s;hould as
carefully avoid &s;peaking &s;ome truths, as rai&s;ing
&s;ome forgeries upon him.</P>
<P>OF what fatal con&s;equence then is the rai&s;ing
rumours and &s;u&s;picions upon the credit and
characters of young trade&s;men? and how little
do tho&s;e who are forward to rai&s;e &s;uch &s;u&s;pi|cions,
and &s;pread &s;uch rumours, con&s;ult con|&s;cience,
or principle, or honour, in what they
do? how little do they con&s;ider that they are
committing a trading murther, and that, in re|&s;pect
to the ju&s;tice of it, they may with much
more equity break open the trade&s;man's hou&s;e,
and rob his ca&s;h-che&s;t, or his &s;hop? and what
they can carry away thence will not do him
half the injury that robbing his character of
what is due to it from an upright and diligent
conduct, would do: the lo&s;s of his money or
goods is ea&s;ily made up, and may be &s;ometimes
repaired with advantage; but the lo&s;s of credit
is never repair'd; the one is breaking open his
hou&s;e, but the other is burning it down; the
one carries away &s;ome goods, but the other
&s;huts goods out from coming in; one is hurt|ing
the trade&s;man, but the other is undoing
him.</P>
<P>CREDIT is the trade&s;man's life, 'tis, as the
Wi&s;eman &s;ays, <HI>marrow to his bones;</HI> 'tis by this
that all his affairs go on pro&s;perou&s;ly and plea|&s;antly;
if this be hurt, wounded or weakened,
the trade&s;man is &s;ick, hangs his head, is dejected
<PB N="236" REF="255">
and di&s;couraged; and if he does go on, it is
heavily and with difficulty, as well as with di&s;|advantage;
he is beholding to his fund of ca&s;h,
not his friends; and he may be truly &s;aid to
&s;tand upon his own legs, for nothing el&s;e can
do it.</P>
<P>AND therefore, on the other hand, if &s;uch a
man is any way beholding to his credit, if he
&s;tood before upon the foundation of his credit,
if he owes any thing con&s;iderable, 'tis a thou|&s;and
to one but he &s;inks under the oppre&s;&s;ion
of it; that is to &s;ay, it brings every body upon
him; I mean, every one that has any demand
upon him; for in pu&s;hing for their own, e&s;pe|cially
in &s;uch ca&s;es, men have &s;o little mercy,
and are &s;o univer&s;ally per&s;uaded that he that
comes fir&s;t is fir&s;t &s;erved, that I did not at all
wonder, that in the &s;tory of the trade&s;man who
&s;o fooli&s;hly expo&s;ed him&s;elf in the coffee-hou&s;e,
<HI>as above,</HI> his friend whom he &s;aid the words to,
began with him that very night, and before he
went out of the coffee-hou&s;e; it was rather
a wonder to me he did not go out and bring
in half a dozen more upon him the &s;ame even|ing.</P>
<P>IT is very rarely that men are wanting to
their own intere&s;t; and the jealou&s;y of its be|ing
but in danger, is enough to make men for|get,
not friend&s;hip only, and genero&s;ity, but good
manners, civility, and even ju&s;tice it &s;elf,
and fall upon the be&s;t friends they have in the
world, if they think they are in the lea&s;t dan|ger
of &s;uffering by them.</P>
<P><PB N="237" REF="256">
ON the&s;e accounts it is, and many more, that
a trade&s;man walks in continual jeopardy, from
the loo&s;ne&s;s and inadvertency of mens tongues,
ay, and womens too; for tho' I am all along
very tender of the Ladies, and would do ju&s;tice
to the &s;ex, by telling you, they were not the
dangerous people whom I had in view in my fir&s;t
writing upon this &s;ubject; yet I mu&s;t be allow'd
to &s;ay, that they are &s;ometimes fully even with
the men, for ill u&s;age, when they plea&s;e to fall
upon them in this nice article, in revenge for
any &s;light, or but pretended &s;light, put upon
them.</P>
<P>IT was a terrible revenge a certain Lady, who
was affronted by a trade&s;man in <HI>London,</HI> in a
matter of love, took upon him in this very ar|ticle.
It &s;eems a trade&s;man had courted her
&s;ome time, and it was become publick, as a
thing in a manner concluded, when the trade&s;man
left the Lady a little abruptly, without
giving a good rea&s;on for it; and indeed &s;he af|terwards
di&s;covered that he had left her for the
offer of another with a little more money, and
that when he had done &s;o, he reported that it
was for another rea&s;on, which reflected a little
on the per&s;on of the Lady: and in this the
trade&s;man did very unworthily indeed, and de|&s;erv'd
her re&s;entment; but, as I &s;aid, it was a
terrible revenge &s;he took, and what &s;he ought
not to have done.</P>
<P>FIRST &s;he found out who it was that her for|mer
pretended lover had been recommended
to, and &s;he found means to have it in&s;inuated
to her by a woman-friend, that is to &s;ay, a &s;he-Devil,
<PB N="238" REF="257">
that he was not only raki&s;h and wicked,
but in &s;hort, that he had the Foul di&s;ea&s;e, and
went &s;o far as to produce letters from him to
a Quack-Doctor, for directions to him how to
take his medicines, and afterwards a receipt for
money for the cure; tho' both the letters and
receipt al&s;o, as afterwards appear'd, were forg'd,
in which &s;he went a di&s;mal length in her re|venge,
as you may &s;ee.</P>
<P>THEN &s;he &s;et two or three female in&s;truments
to di&s;cour&s;e her ca&s;e in all their go&s;&s;ips com|panies,
and at the Tea-tables where-ever they
came, and to magnify the Lady's prudence in
refu&s;ing &s;uch a man, and what an e&s;cape &s;he had
had in being clear of him.</P>
<P>WHY, &s;ays a Lady to one of the&s;e emi&s;&s;aries,
what was the matter? I thought &s;he was like to
be very well married.</P>
<P>O! no, Madam, by no means, <HI>&s;ays the Emi&s;|&s;ary.</HI></P>
<P>WHY, Madam, <HI>&s;ays another Lady,</HI> we all

he's no beauty, no rarity that way; but I mean
a clever good &s;ort of a man in his bu&s;ine&s;s,
&s;uch as we call a pretty trade&s;man.</P>
<P>AY, <HI>&s;ays the Lady employ'd,</HI> but that is not
all neither.</P>
<P>WHY, <HI>&s;ays the other Lady,</HI> he has a very
good trade too, and lives in good credit.</P>
<P><PB N="239" REF="258">

been very good.</P>
<P>IF it had, I &s;uppo&s;e, <HI>&s;ays the fir&s;t,</HI> the match
had not been broke off.</P>
<P>WHY, <HI>&s;ays the Lady,</HI> I under&s;tood it was
broken off on his &s;ide.</P>

<P>NO, Madam, good! alas he has no

<SP>
<SPEAKER>2. La.</SPEAKER>
<P>NO bottom! why you &s;urpri&s;e me;
we always look'd upon him to be a man of

world.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>It's all a cheat, Madam, there's nothing

<P>ALAS, Madam! how could &s;he know,
poor Lady, 'till her friends enquir'd into things;

<SP>
<SPEAKER>1. La.</SPEAKER>
<P>IT mu&s;t be formerly then; for they

for a greater fortune, he wants it enough.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>2. La.</SPEAKER>

<SP>

<P>ESPECIALLY, Madam, when they know
them&s;elves to be gone &s;o far, that even with the

mu&s;t inevitably bring the Lady to de&s;truction with

<P>NAY, Madam, I do not tell this part
of my own knowledge; I only heard &s;o, but I
am afraid there is too much in it.</P>
</SP>
<P>THUS ended this piece of helli&s;h wildfire, up|on
the character and credit of a trade&s;man; the
truth of all which was no more than this, that
the trade&s;man di&s;liking his fir&s;t Lady left her,
and &s;oon after, tho' not pre&s;ently, courted an|other
of a &s;uperior fortune indeed, <HI>tho' not
for that rea&s;on;</HI> and the fir&s;t Lady, provok'd at
being ca&s;t off, and, as &s;he call'd it, &s;lighted,
rais'd all this clamour upon him, and per&s;ecuted
him with it, wherever &s;he was able.</P>
<P>SUCH a di&s;cour&s;e as this at a <HI>Tea-table,</HI> it
could not be expected, would be long a &s;ecret;
it ran from one tittle-tattle &s;ociety to another;
and in every company, <HI>&s;now-ball like,</HI> it was far
from le&s;&s;ening, and it went on 'till at length it
began to meet with &s;ome contradiction, and the
trade&s;man found him&s;elf obliged to trace it as
far and as well as he could.</P>
<P>BUT it was to no purpo&s;e to confront it;
when one was ask'd, and another was ask'd,
<PB N="244" REF="263">
they only an&s;wer'd they heard &s;o, and they heard
it in company in &s;uch a place, and in &s;uch a
place, and &s;ome could remember where they
had it, and &s;ome could not; and the poor trade&s;|man,
though he was really a man of &s;ub&s;tance,
&s;unk under it prodigiou&s;ly: his new mi&s;tre&s;s,
whom he courted, refus'd him, and would ne|ver
hear any thing in his favour, or trouble her|&s;elf
to examine whether it was true, or no; it
was enough, &s;he &s;aid, to her, that he was load|en
with &s;uch a report; and if it was unju&s;t &s;he
was &s;orry for it, but the misfortune mu&s;t be his,
and he mu&s;t place it to the account of his hav|ing
made &s;ome enemies, which &s;he could not
help.</P>
<P>AS to his credit, the &s;lander of the fir&s;t La|dy's
rai&s;ing was &s;pread indu&s;triou&s;ly, and with
the utmo&s;t malice and bitterne&s;s, and did him
an inexpre&s;&s;ible prejudice; every man he dealt
with was &s;hy of him; every man he ow'd any
thing to, came for it; and, as he &s;aid, he was
&s;ure he &s;hould &s;ee the la&s;t penny demanded;
It was his happine&s;s that he had wherewith to
pay, for had his circum&s;tances been in the lea&s;t
perplexed, the man had been undone; nay, as
I have ob&s;erv'd in another ca&s;e, as his affairs might
have lain, he might have been able to have paid
forty &s;hillings in the pound, and yet have been
undone, and been obliged to break, and &s;hut up
his &s;hop.</P>
<P>IT is true, he work'd thro' it, and he car|ried
it &s;o far, as to fix the malice of all the re|ports
pretty much upon the fir&s;t Lady; and par|ticularly
&s;o far, as to di&s;cover that &s;he was the
<PB N="245" REF="264">
great rea&s;on of his being &s;o po&s;itively rejected
by the other; but he could never fix it &s;o upon
her, as to recover any damages of her, only to
expo&s;e her a little; and that &s;he did not value,
having, <HI>as &s;he &s;aid wickedly,</HI> had her full revenge
of him, and &s;o indeed &s;he had.</P>
<P>THE &s;um of the matter is, and it is for this
rea&s;on I tell you the &s;tory, that the reputation
of a trade&s;man is too much at the mercy of
mens tongues, <HI>or womens either;</HI> and a &s;tory rai|&s;ed
upon a trade&s;man, however malicious, how|ever
fal&s;e, and however friclous the occa&s;ion,
is not ea&s;ily &s;uppre&s;s'd, but if it touches his
credit, as a fla&s;h of fire it &s;preads over the whole
air like a &s;heet, there is no &s;topping it.</P>
<P>MY inference from all this &s;hall be very brief;
if the tongues of every ill di&s;po&s;ed envious go&s;|&s;ip,
whether man-go&s;&s;ip, or woman-go&s;&s;ip, for
there are of both &s;orts, may be thus mi&s;chiev|ous
to the trade&s;man, and he is &s;o much at the
mercy of the tattling &s;landering part of the
world; how much more &s;hould trade&s;men be
cautious and wary, how they touch or wound the
credit and character of one another? there are
but a very few trade&s;men who can &s;ay they are
out of the reach of &s;lander, and that the malice
of enemies cannot hurt them with the tongue:
here and there one, and tho&s;e antient and well-e&s;tabli&s;h'd,
may be able to defy the world; but
there are &s;o many others, that I think I may
warn all trade&s;men again&s;t making havock of
one another's reputation, as they would be ten|derly
us'd in the &s;ame ca&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="246" REF="265">
AND yet I cannot but &s;ay it is too much a
trade&s;man's crime, I mean, to &s;peak &s;lightly and
contemptibly of other trade&s;men, their neigh|bours,
or perhaps rivals in trade, and to run them
down in the characters they give of them, when
inquiry may be made of them, as often is the
ca&s;e: The reputation of trade&s;men is too often
put into the hands of their fellow-trade&s;men,
when ignorant people think to inform them|&s;elves
of their circum&s;tances, by going to tho&s;e
who&s;e intere&s;t it is to defame and run them
down.</P>
<P>I know no ca&s;e in the world, in which there
is more occa&s;ion for the golden rule, <HI>quod tibi
fieri non vis, alteri ne feceris,</HI> do as you would
be done unto; and tho' you may be e&s;tabli&s;h'd
as you may think, and be above the reach of
the tongues of others, yet the obligation of the
rule is the &s;ame, for you are to do as you would
be done unto, &s;uppo&s;ing that you were in the
&s;ame condition, or on a level with the per&s;on.</P>
<P>IT is confe&s;s'd, that trade&s;men do not &s;tudy
this rule in the particular ca&s;e I am now &s;peak|ing
of: no men are apter to &s;peak &s;lightly and
coldly of a fellow-trade&s;man, than his fellow-trade&s;men,
and to &s;peak unju&s;tly &s;o too; the
rea&s;ons for which cannot be good, unle&s;s it
can be pleaded for upon the foundation of a
ju&s;t and impartial concern in the intere&s;t of the
inquirer; and even then nothing mu&s;t be &s;aid,
but what is con&s;i&s;tent with &s;trict ju&s;tice and
truth; all that is more than that, is meer &s;lander
and envy, and has nothing of the chri&s;tian in
it, much le&s;s of the neighbour, or friend. It
<PB N="247" REF="266">
is true, that friend&s;hip may be due to the in|quirer,
but &s;till &s;o much ju&s;tice is due to the
per&s;on enquir'd of, that 'tis very hard to &s;peak
in &s;uch ca&s;es, and not be guilty of rai&s;ing du&s;t,
as they call it, upon your neighbour, and at
lea&s;t hurting, if not injuring him.</P>
<P>IT is indeed &s;o difficult a thing, that I &s;carce
know what &s;tated rule to lay down for the con|duct
of a trade&s;man in this ca&s;e; a trade&s;man
at a di&s;tance is going to deal with another
trade&s;man, my neighbour; and before he comes
to bargain, or before he cares to tru&s;t him, he
goes, <HI>weakly enough</HI> perhaps, to enquire of
him, and of his circum&s;tances among his neigh|bours
and fellow trade&s;men, perhaps of the &s;ame
profe&s;&s;ion, or employment, and who among o|ther
things, it may be, are concerned by their
intere&s;t, that this trade&s;man's credit &s;hould not
ri&s;e too fa&s;t: What mu&s;t be done in this ca&s;e?</P>
<P>IF I am the per&s;on enquir'd of, what mu&s;t I
do? if I would have this man &s;ink in his repu|tation,
or be di&s;credited, and if it is for my in|tere&s;t
to have him cried down in the world, it
is a &s;ore temptation to me to put in a few
words to his di&s;advantage; and yet if I do it
in gratification of my private views or intere&s;t,
o$ upon the foot of re&s;entment of any kind
whatever, and let it be from what occa&s;ion it
will, nay, however ju&s;t and rea&s;onable the re|&s;entment
is, or may be, it is utterly unju&s;t and
unlawful, and is not only unfair as a man, but
unchri&s;tian, and is neither le&s;s or more than a
&s;ecret revenge, which is forbidden by the laws
of God and man.</P>
<P><PB N="248" REF="267">
IF on the other hand I give a good character
of the man, or of his reputation, I mean, of
his credit in bu&s;ine&s;s, in order to have the en|quirer
tru&s;t him, and at the &s;ame time know
or believe that he is not a &s;ound and good man,
(that is, as to trade, for it is his character in
trade that I am &s;peaking of) what am I doing
then? 'tis plain I lay a &s;nare for the enquirer,
and am at lea&s;t in&s;trumental to his lo&s;s, without
having really any de&s;ign to hurt him; for 'tis
to be &s;uppos'd, before he came to me to en|quire,
I had no view of acting any thing to his
prejudice.</P>
<P>AGAIN, there's no medium; for to refu&s;e or
decline giving a character of the man is down|right
giving him the wor&s;t character I can; 'tis
in &s;hort &s;hooting him thro' the head in his trade:
a man comes to me for a character of my neigh|bouring
trade&s;man; I an&s;wer him with a re|pul&s;e
to his enquiry thus,</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>A.</SPEAKER>

my neighbours; I re&s;olve to meddle with no

<P>I tell you, Sir, I meddle with no man's

</SP>
<P>HE us'd a great many more words with him
to convince him, that he did not mean any
di&s;credit to his neighbour trade&s;man; but it was
all one, he would have it be, that his declining
to give his &s;aid neighbour a good character was
giving him an ill character, which the other told
him was a wrong inference: however he found
that the man &s;tood by his own notion of it,
and declin'd tru&s;ting the trade&s;man with the
goods, tho' he was &s;atisfied he (the trade&s;man) was
a &s;ufficient man.</P>
<P>UPON this he was a little unea&s;y, imagining
that he had been the cau&s;e of it, as indeed he
had, next to the po&s;itive humour of the enqui|rer,
tho' it was not really his fault, neither was
the con&s;truction the other made of it ju&s;t to his
intention; for he aim'd at freeing him&s;elf from
all enquiries of that nature, but found there was
no prevailing with him to under&s;tand it any o|ther
way than he did; &s;o to require the man a
little in his own way, he contriv'd the follow|ing
method; he met with him two or three
days after, and ask'd him if he had &s;old his goods
to the per&s;on his neighbour.</P>
<P>NO, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> you know I would not.</P>
<P>NAY, <HI>&s;ays the other,</HI> I only knew you &s;aid
&s;o; I did not think you would have acted &s;o
from what I &s;aid, nor do I think I gave you any
rea&s;on.</P>
<P><PB N="252" REF="271">
WHY, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> I knew you would have given
him a good character if you could, and I knew
you were too hone&s;t to do it, if you were not
&s;ure it was ju&s;t.</P>
<P>THE la&s;t part I hope is true, but you might
have believ'd me hone&s;t too in what I did &s;ay,
that I had re&s;olv'd to give no characters of any
body.</P>
<P>AS to that I took it, as any body would, to
be the be&s;t and mode&s;te&s;t way of covering what
you would not have be di&s;clos'd, namely, that
you could not &s;peak as you would; and I al&s;o
judg'd, that you therefore cho&s;e to &s;ay no|thing.</P>
<P>WELL, I can &s;ay no more but this; you are
not ju&s;t to me in it, and I think you are not
ju&s;t to your&s;elf neither.</P>
<P>THEY parted again upon this, and the next
day the fir&s;t trade&s;man, who had been &s;o pre&s;s'd
to give a character of his neighbour, &s;ent a man
to buy the parcel of goods of the other trade&s;|man,
and offering him ready money, bought
them con&s;iderably cheaper than the neighbour-trade&s;man
was to have given for them, be&s;ides
reckoning a rea&s;onable di&s;count for the time,
which was four months, that the fir&s;t trade&s;man
was to have given to his neighbour.</P>
<P>AS &s;oon as he had done, he went and told
the neighbour trade&s;man what he had done, and
the rea&s;on of it, and &s;old the whole parcel to
him again, giving the &s;ame four months credit
for them, as the fir&s;t man was to have given,
and taking the di&s;count for time only to him|&s;elf,
gave him all the advantage of the buying,
<PB N="253" REF="272">
and gave the fir&s;t man the mortification of know|ing
it all, and that the goods were not only for
the &s;ame man, but that the very trade&s;man,
whom he would not believe when he declin'd
giving a character of any man in general, had
tru&s;ted him with them.</P>
<P>HE pretended to be very angry, and to take
it very ill; but the other told him, that when
he came to him for a character of the man, and
he told him hone&s;tly, that he would give no
characters at all; that it was not for any ill to
his neighbour that he declin'd it; he ought to
have believ'd him; and that he hop'd when he
wanted a character of any of his neighbours a|gain,
he would not come to him for it.</P>
<P>THIS &s;tory is to my purpo&s;e in this particu|lar,
which is indeed very &s;ignificant; that it
is the mo&s;t difficult thing of its kind in the world
to avoid giving characters of our neighbouring
trade&s;men; and that let your rea&s;ons for it be
what they will, to refu&s;e giving a character is
giving a bad character, and is generally &s;o tak|en,
whatever caution or arguments you u&s;e to
the contrary.</P>
<P>IN the next place 'tis hard indeed, if an ho|ne&s;t
neighbour be in danger of &s;elling a large
parcel of goods to a fellow, who I may know
it is not likely &s;hould be able to pay for them,
tho' his credit may in the common appearance
be pretty good at that time; and what mu&s;t I
do? if I di&s;cover the man's circum&s;tances, which
perhaps I am let into by &s;ome accident, I &s;ay,
if I di&s;cover them, the man is undone; and if
I do not, the trade&s;man, who is in danger of
tru&s;ting him, is undone.</P>
<P><PB N="254" REF="273">
I confe&s;s the way is clear, if I am obliged to
&s;peak at all in the ca&s;e; the man un&s;ound is
already a Bankrupt at bottom, and mu&s;t fail;
but the other man is &s;ound and firm, if this
di&s;a&s;ter does not befall him; the fir&s;t has no
wound given him, but negatively; he &s;tands
where he &s;tood before; whereas the other is
drawn in perhaps to his own ruin; in the next
place the fir&s;t is a knave, or rather thief, for he
offers to buy, and knows he cannot pay; in a
word, he offers to cheat his neighbour; and if
I know it, I am &s;o far confederate with him in
the cheat.</P>
<P>IN this ca&s;e I think I am obliged to give the
hone&s;t man a due caution for his &s;afety, if he
de&s;ires my advice; I cannot &s;ay I am obliged
officiou&s;ly to go out of my way to do it, unle&s;s
I am any way intere&s;ted in the per&s;on; for that
would be to dip into other mens affairs, which
is not my proper work; and if I &s;hould any
way be mi&s;inform'd of the circum&s;tances of the
trade&s;man I am to &s;peak of, and wrong him, I
may be in&s;trumental to bring ruin cau&s;ele&s;ly
upon him.</P>
<P>IN a word, it is a very nice and critical ca&s;e,
and a trade&s;man ought to be very &s;ure of what
he &s;ays or does in &s;uch a ca&s;e, the good or evil
fate of his neighbour lying much at &s;take, and
depending too much upon the breath of his
mouth: every part of this di&s;cour&s;e &s;hews how
much a trade&s;man's welfare depends upon the
ju&s;tice and courte&s;y of his neighbours, and how
nice and critical a thing his reputation is.</P>
<P><PB N="255" REF="274">
THIS well con&s;ider'd would always keep a
trade&s;man humble, and &s;hew him what need
he has to behave courteou&s;ly and obligingly a|mong
his neighbours; for one malicious word
from a man much meaner than him&s;elf, may
overthrow him in &s;uch a manner, as all the
friends he has may not be able to recover him;
a trade&s;man if po&s;&s;ible &s;hould never make him|&s;elf
any enemies.</P>
<P>BUT if it is &s;o fatal a thing to trade&s;men to
give characters of one another, and that a trade&s;|man
&s;hould be &s;o backward in it for fear of
hurting his neighbour, and that, notwith&s;tanding
the character given &s;hould be ju&s;t, and the parti|cular
reported of him &s;hould be true; with how
much greater caution &s;hould we act in like ca&s;es,
where what is &s;ugge&s;ted is really fal&s;e in fact,
and the trade&s;man is innocent, as was the ca&s;e
in the trade&s;man mentioned before about court|ing
the Lady? if a trade&s;man may be ruin'd
and undone by a true report, much more may
he be &s;o by a fal&s;e report, by a malicious, &s;lan|dering,
defaming tongue: There is an artful
way of talking of other peoples reputation, which
really, however &s;ome people &s;alve the matter, is
equal, if not &s;uperior, in malice to the wor&s;t
thing they can &s;ay; this is, by rendring them &s;u&s;|pected,
talking doubtfully of their characters,
and of their conduct, and rendring them fir&s;t
doubtful, and then &s;trongly &s;u&s;pected, I don't
know what to &s;ay to &s;uch a man. A Gentleman
came to me the other day, but I knew not what
to &s;ay, I dare not &s;ay he is a good man, or that
I would tru&s;t him with five hundred pound my
<PB N="256" REF="275">
&s;elf; if I &s;hould &s;ay &s;o, I &s;hould bely my own
opinion; I do not know indeed, he may be a
good man at bottom, but I cannot &s;ay he minds
his bu&s;ine&s;s, if I &s;hould, I mu&s;t lie, I think he
keeps a great deal of company, <HI>and the like.</HI></P>
<P>ANOTHER, he is ask'd of the currency of his
payments, and he an&s;wers &s;u&s;piciou&s;ly on that
&s;ide too; I know not what to &s;ay, he may pay
them at la&s;t, but he does not pay them the mo&s;t
currently of any man in the &s;treet, and I have
heard &s;aucy boys huff him at his door for bills on
his endeavouring to put them off; indeed I mu&s;t
needs &s;ay I had a bill on him a few weeks ago
for an hundred pounds, and he paid me very
currently, and without any dunning, or often
calling upon, but it was I believe becau&s;e I of|fer'd
him a bargain at that time, and I &s;uppos'd
he was re&s;olv'd to put a good face upon his
credit.</P>
<P>A trade&s;man, <HI>that would do as he would be
done by,</HI> &s;hould carefully avoid the&s;e people who
come always about, enquiring after other trade&s;|mens
characters: There are men who make it
their bu&s;ine&s;s to do thus; and as they are there|by
as ready to ruin and blow up good fair deal|ing
trade&s;men as others, &s;o they do actually &s;ur|pri&s;e
many, and come at their characters earlier
and nearer than they expect they would.</P>
<P>TRADESMEN, <HI>I &s;ay,</HI> that will thus behave to
one another, cannot be &s;uppos'd to be men of
much principle, but will be apt to lay hold of
any other advantage, how unju&s;t &s;oever, and
indeed will wait for an occa&s;ion of &s;uch advan|tages;
and where is there a trade&s;man, but who,
<PB N="257" REF="276">
if he be never &s;o circum&s;pect, may &s;ome time
or other give his neighbour, who watches for
his halting, advantage enough again&s;t him: when
&s;uch a malicious trade&s;man appears in any place,
all the hone&s;t trade&s;men about him ought to join
to expo&s;e him, whether they are afraid of him,
or no; they &s;hould <HI>blow him</HI> among the neigh|bourhood,
as a publick nu&s;ance, as a common
Barrettor, or rai&s;er of &s;candal; by &s;uch a gene|ral
aver&s;ion to him they would depreciate him,
and bring him into &s;o ju&s;t a contempt, that no
body would keep him company, much le&s;s cre|dit
any thing he &s;aid; and then his tongue would
be no &s;lander, and his breath would be no bla&s;t;
and no body would either tell him any thing,
or hear any thing from him; and this kind of
u&s;age, I think, is the only way to put a &s;top
to a defamer; for when he has no credit of
his own left, he would be unable to hurt any
of his neighbours.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XVI.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Trade&s;man's entring into Partner|&s;hip
in Trade, and the many dangers
attending it.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_THERE are &s;ome bu&s;ine&s;&s;es which are
more particularly accu&s;tomed to part|ner&s;hips
than others, and &s;ome that are
very &s;eldom managed without two,
three, or four partners, and others that cannot
be at all carried on without partner&s;hip; and
there are others again, in which they &s;eldom join
partners together.</P>
<P><HI>Mercers, Linen - Drapers; Banking Gold|&s;miths,</HI>
and &s;uch con&s;iderable trades, are often,
and indeed generally carried on in partner|&s;hip,
but other meaner trades, and of le&s;s bu|&s;ine&s;s,
are carried on, generally &s;peaking, &s;ingle
handed.</P>
<P>SOME <HI>Merchants,</HI> who carry on great bu&s;i|ne&s;s
in foreign ports, have what they call Hou&s;es
in tho&s;e ports, where they plant and breed up
their &s;ons and apprentices; and the&s;e are &s;uch
as I hinted could not carry on their bu&s;ine&s;s
without partner&s;hip.</P>
<P><PB N="259" REF="278">
THE trading in partner&s;hip is not only liable
to more hazards and difficulties, but it expo&s;es
the trade&s;man to more &s;nares and di&s;advantages
by a great deal, than the trading with a &s;ingle
hand does; and &s;ome of tho&s;e &s;nares are the&s;e.</P>
<P>1. IF the partner is a &s;tirring, diligent, ca|pable
man, there is danger of his &s;lipping into
the whole trade, and getting in between you
and home, by his application, thru&s;ting you at
la&s;t quite out; &s;o that you bring in a &s;nake into
your chimney-corner, which, when it is warm'd
and grown vigorous, turns about at you, and
hi&s;&s;es you out of the hou&s;e: It is with the trade&s;|man,
in the ca&s;e of a diligent and active partner,
as I have already ob&s;erv'd it was in the ca&s;e of a
tru&s;ty and diligent apprentice; namely, that if
the ma&s;ter does not appear con&s;tantly at the
head of the bu&s;ine&s;s, and make him&s;elf be known
by his own application and diligence to be what
<HI>he is;</HI> he &s;hall &s;oon look to be what <HI>he is not,</HI>
that is to &s;ay, one not concern'd in the bu&s;i|ne&s;s.</P>
<P>HE will never fail to be e&s;teem'd the princi|pal
per&s;on concern'd in the &s;hop, and in the
trade, who is principally and mo&s;t con&s;tantly
found there, acting at the head of every bu&s;i|ne&s;s;
and be it a &s;ervant or a partner, the ma|&s;ter
or chief lo&s;es him&s;elf extremely by the ad|vances
the other makes of that kind; for when|ever
they part again, either the apprentice by
being out of his time, or the partner by the ex|piration
of the articles of partner&s;hip, or by any
other determination of their agreement, the
cu&s;tomers mo&s;t certainly de&s;ire to deal with the
<PB N="260" REF="279">
man whom they have &s;o often been obliged by;
and if they mi&s;s him, enquire after and follow
him.</P>
<P>IT is true, the apprentice is the more danger|ous
of the two, becau&s;e his &s;eparation is &s;up|po&s;ed
to be more certain, and generally &s;oon|er
than the partner; the apprentice is not known,
and cannot have made his intere&s;t among the
buyers, but for perhaps a year, or a year and a
half before his time expir'd; &s;ooner than that
he could not put him&s;elf in the way of being
known and ob&s;erv'd; and then, when his time
is out, he certainly removes, unle&s;s he is taken
into the &s;hop as a Partner, and that indeed pro|longs
the time, and places the injury at a
greater di&s;tance, but &s;till it makes it the more
influencing when it comes; and unle&s;s he is
brought &s;ome how or other into the family,
and becomes one of the hou&s;e, perhaps by mar|riage,
or &s;ome other &s;ettled union with the ma|&s;ter,
he never goes off without making a great
cha&s;m in the ma&s;ter's affairs, and the more, by
how much he has been more diligent and u&s;e|ful
in the trade, the wounds of which the ma|&s;ter
&s;eldom if ever recovers.</P>
<P>IF the partner was not an apprentice, but that
they either came out of their times together,
or near it, or had a &s;hop and bu&s;ine&s;s before,
but quitted it to come in, it may then be &s;aid
that he brought part of the trade with him,
and &s;o encreas'd the trade when he join'd with
the other in proportion to what he may be &s;aid
to carry away when he went off; this is the be&s;t
thing that can be &s;aid of a partner&s;hip; and
<PB N="261" REF="280">
then I have this to add, fir&s;t, that the trade&s;man
who took the Partner in, has a fair field indeed
to act in with his Partner, and mu&s;t take care,
by his con&s;tant attendance, due acquaintance
with the cu&s;tomers, and appearing in every part
of the bu&s;ine&s;s, to maintain not his intere&s;t
only, but the appearance of his intere&s;t in the
&s;hop or warehou&s;e, that he may on every oc|ca&s;ion,
and to every cu&s;tomer, not only be, but
be known to be, the ma&s;ter and head of the
bu&s;ine&s;s; and that the other is at be&s;t but a
Partner, and not a chief Partner, as in ca&s;e of
his ab&s;ence and negligence will pre&s;ently be
&s;ugge&s;ted; for he that chiefly appears will be al|ways
chief Partner in the eye of the cu&s;tomers,
whatever he is in the &s;ub&s;tance of the thing.</P>
<P>THIS indeed is much the &s;ame ca&s;e with what
is &s;aid before of a diligent &s;ervant, and a neg|ligent
ma&s;ter, and therefore I forbear to enlarge
upon it; but it is &s;o important in both ca&s;es,
that indeed it cannot well be mentioned too
often: the ma&s;ter's full application, in his own
per&s;on, is the only an&s;wer to both. He that
takes a partner only to ea&s;e him of the toil of
his bu&s;ine&s;s, that he may take his plea&s;ure, and
leave the drudgery, as they call it, to the Part|ner,
&s;hould take care not to do it till about
&s;even years before he re&s;olves to leave off trade;
that at the end of the partner&s;hip he may be
&s;atisfied to give up the trade to his Partner, or
&s;ee him run away with it, and not trouble him|&s;elf
about it.</P>
<P>BUT if he takes a partner at his beginning,
with an intent, by their joint enlarged &s;tock,
<PB N="262" REF="281">
to enlarge their bu&s;ine&s;s, and &s;o carry on a ca|pital
trade, which perhaps neither of them were
able to do by them&s;elves, and which is the on|ly
ju&s;tifiable rea&s;on for taking a partner at all,
he mu&s;t re&s;olve then to join with his Partner,
not only in &s;tock, but in mutual diligence and
application, that the trade may flouri&s;h by their
joint a&s;&s;i&s;tance and con&s;tant labour, as two oxen
yoak'd together in the &s;ame draught, by their
joint a&s;&s;i&s;tance, draw much more than double
what they could either of them draw by their
&s;ingle &s;trength; and this indeed is the only &s;afe
circum&s;tance of a partner&s;hip; then indeed they
are properly partners when they are a&s;&s;i&s;tants to
one another; whereas otherwi&s;e they are like
two game&s;ters &s;triving to worm one another
out, and to get the ma&s;tery in the play they
are engaged in.</P>
<P>THE very word <HI>Partner,</HI> imports the &s;ub&s;tance
of the thing, and they are as &s;uch engaged to a
mutual application, or they are no more <HI>Part|ners,</HI>
but rather one is the trading gentleman,
and the other is the trading drudge; but even
then let them depend, the drudge will carry a|way
the trade and the profit too at la&s;t; and
this is the way how one partner may hone&s;tly
ruin another, and for ought I know 'tis the on|ly
one; for it cannot be &s;aid but that the dili|gent
Partner acts hone&s;tly in acting diligently,
and if the other did the &s;ame they would both
thrive alike; but if one is negligent and the
other diligent, one extravagant and expen&s;ive,
the other frugal and prudent, it cannot be &s;aid
to be his fault, that one is rich, and the other
<PB N="263" REF="282">
poor; that one encrea&s;es in the &s;tock, and the
other is le&s;&s;en'd, and at la&s;t work'd quite out
of it.</P>
<P>AS a Partner then is taken in only for ca&s;e,
to abate the fir&s;t trade&s;man's diligence, and take
off the edge of his application, &s;o far a Partner,
let him be as hone&s;t and diligent as he will, is
dangerous to the trade&s;man; nay, the more ho|ne&s;t
and the more diligent he is, the more dan|gerous
he is, and the more a &s;nare to the trade&s;|man
that takes him in: and a trade&s;man ought
to be very cautious in the adventure, for indeed
it is an adventure, That he be not brought
in time to relax his diligence, by having a part|ner,
even contrary to his fir&s;t intention; for
lazine&s;s is a &s;ubtle in&s;inuating thing, and 'tis a
&s;ore temptation to a man of ea&s;e and indolence,
to &s;ee his work done for him, and le&s;s need of
him in the bu&s;ine&s;s than u&s;ed to be, and yet
the bu&s;ine&s;s to go on well too; and this danger
is dormant, and lies un&s;een, till after &s;everal
years, it ri&s;es as it were out of its ambu&s;cade,
and &s;urprizes the trade&s;man, letting him &s;ee by
his lo&s;s what his neglect has co&s;t him.</P>
<P>2. BUT there are other dangers in partner|&s;hip,
and tho&s;e not a few; for you may not
only be remi&s;s and negligent, remitting the
weight of the bu&s;ine&s;s upon him, and depend|ing
upon him for its being carried on, by which
he makes him&s;elf ma&s;ter, and brings you to be
forgot in the bu&s;ine&s;s: But he may be crafty
too, and de&s;igning in all this, and when he has
thus brought you to be as it were <HI>no body,</HI> he
&s;hall make him&s;elf be all <HI>&s;ome body</HI> in the trade,
<PB N="264" REF="283">
and in that particular he by degrees gets the
capital intere&s;t, as well as &s;tock in the trade,
while the true original of the &s;hop, who laid
the foundation of the whole bu&s;ine&s;s, brought
a trade to the &s;hop, or brought commi&s;&s;ions to
the hou&s;e, and who&s;e the bu&s;ine&s;s more parti|cularly
is, is &s;ecretly &s;upplanted, and with the
concurrence of his own negligence, for without
that it cannot be, is as it were laid a&s;ide, and at
la&s;t quite thru&s;t out.</P>
<P>THUS whether hone&s;t or di&s;hone&s;t, the trade&s;man
is circumvented, and the partner&s;hip is
made fatal to him; for it was all owing to the
partner&s;hip, the trade&s;man was diligent before,
under&s;tood his bu&s;ine&s;s, and kept clo&s;e to it,
gave up his time to it, and by employing him|&s;elf,
prevented the indolence which he finds
breaking in&s;en&s;ibly upon him afterwards, by
being made ea&s;y, as <HI>they call it,</HI> in the a&s;&s;i&s;tance
of a partner.</P>
<P>5. BUT there are abundance of other ca&s;es
which make a partner&s;hip dangerous; for if it
be &s;o where the partner is hone&s;t and diligent,
and where he works into the heart of the bu|&s;ine&s;s
by his indu&s;try and application, or by his
craft and in&s;inuation, what may it not be if he
proves idle and extravagant; and if in&s;tead of
working him out, he may be &s;aid to play him
out of the bu&s;ine&s;s; that is to &s;ay, prove wild,
expen&s;ive, and run him&s;elf and his partner out
by his extravagance?</P>
<P>THERE are but too many examples of this
kind; and here the hone&s;t trade&s;man has the
labouring oar indeed! for in&s;tead of being a&s;|&s;i&s;ted
<PB N="265" REF="284">
by a diligent indu&s;trious Partner, who on
that account he took into the trade; he proves
a loo&s;e, extravagant, wild fellow, runs abroad
into company, and leaves him (for who&s;e relief
he was taken) in to bear the burden of the
whole trade, which perhaps was too heavy for
him before, and if it had not been &s;o, he had
not been prevail'd with to have taken in a Part|ner
at all.</P>
<P>THIS is indeed a terrible di&s;appointment, and
is very di&s;couraging; and the more &s;o, becau&s;e
it cannot be recall'd; for a partner&s;hip is like
matrimony, it is almo&s;t engaged in for better
for wor&s;e, till the years expire; there is no
breaking it off, at lea&s;t not ea&s;ily nor fairly,
but all the inconveniences which are to be fear'd
will follow and &s;tare in your face: as fir&s;t, the
partner in the fir&s;t place draws out all his &s;tock;
and this &s;ometimes is a blow fatal enough, for
perhaps the partner cannot take the whole trade
upon him&s;elf, and cannot carry on the trade
upon his own &s;tock, if he could, he would not
have taken in a partner at all; this withdrawing
the &s;tock has &s;ometimes been very dangerous
to a partner; nay, has many times been the o|verthrow
and undoing of him and of the fami|ly
that is left.</P>
<P>HE that takes a Partner into his trade on this
account, namely, for the &s;upport of his &s;tock, to
enjoy the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of &s;o much ca&s;h to carry on
the trade, ought &s;eriou&s;ly to con&s;ider what he
&s;hall be able to do when the partner breaking
off the partner&s;hip &s;hall carry all his &s;tock, and
the improvement of it too, with him; perhaps
<PB N="266" REF="285">
the trade&s;man's &s;tock is not much increa&s;ed,
perhaps not at all; nay, perhaps the &s;tock is
le&s;&s;ened, in&s;tead of being increa&s;ed, and they
have rather gone backward than forward; what
&s;hall the trade&s;man do in &s;uch a ca&s;e? and how
&s;hall he bear the breach in his &s;tock which that
&s;eparation would make?</P>
<P>THUS he is either tied down to the Partner,
or the partner is pin'd down to him, for he
cannot &s;eparate without a breach. It is a &s;ad
truth to many a partner, that when the part|ner&s;hip
comes to be fini&s;hed and expired, the
man would let his partner go, but the other
cannot go without tearing him all to pieces
whom he leaves behind him; and yet the part|ner
being loo&s;e, idle, and extravagant, in a word,
will ruin both if he &s;tays.</P>
<P>THIS is the danger of partner&s;hip in &s;ome of
the be&s;t circum&s;tances of it; but how hazard|ous
and how fatal is it in other ca&s;es? and how
many an hone&s;t and indu&s;trious trade&s;man has
been prevail'd with to take in a partner to ea&s;e
him&s;elf in the weight of the bu&s;ine&s;s, or on &s;e|veral
other accounts, &s;ome perhaps rea&s;onable
and prudent enough, but has found him&s;elf
immediately involv'd in a &s;ea of trouble, is
brought into innumerable difficulties, conceal'd
debts, and unknown incumbrances, &s;uch as he
could no ways extricate him&s;elf out of, and &s;o
both have been unavoidably ruin'd together?</P>
<P>THESE ca&s;es are &s;o various and &s;o uncertain,
that it is not ea&s;y to enumerate them; but we
may include the particulars in a general or two.</P>
<P><PB N="267" REF="286">
1. ONE partner may contract debts, even in
the partner&s;hip it &s;elf, &s;o far unknown to the
other, as that the other may be involv'd in the
danger of them, tho' he was not at all concern'd
in, or acquainted with them at the time they
were contracted.</P>
<P>2. ONE partner may di&s;charge debts for both
partners, and &s;o having a de&s;ign to be knavi&s;h,
may go and receive money and give receipts
for it, and not bringing it to account, or not
bringing the money into ca&s;h, may wrong the
&s;tock to &s;o con&s;iderable a &s;um, as may be to the
ruin of the other partner.</P>
<P>3. ONE partner may confe&s;s judgment, or
give bonds, or current notes in the name, and
as for the account of the company, and yet con|vert
the effects to his own private u&s;e, leaving
the &s;tock to be an&s;werable for the value.</P>
<P>4. ONE partner may &s;ell and give credit, and
deliver parcels of goods to what &s;um, or what
quantity he thinks fit, and to whom, and &s;o by
his indi&s;cretion, or perhaps by connivance and
knavery, lo&s;e to the &s;tock what parcel of goods
he plea&s;es, to the ruin of the other partner,
and bring them&s;elves to be both bankrupt to|gether.</P>
<P>5. NAY, to &s;um up all, one partner may com|mit
acts of bankrupcy without the knowledge
of the other, and thereby &s;ubject the united
&s;tock, and both or all the partners to the dan|ger
of a commi&s;&s;ion, when they may them&s;elves
know nothing of it till the blow is given, and
given &s;o, as to be too late to be retrieved.</P>
<P><PB N="268" REF="287">
ALL the&s;e and many more being the ill con|&s;equences
and dangers of partner&s;hip in trade,
I cannot but &s;eriou&s;ly warn the hone&s;t indu&s;tri|ous
trade&s;man, if po&s;&s;ible, to &s;tand upon his
own legs, and go on upon his own bottom;
to pur&s;ue his bu&s;ine&s;s diligently, but cautiou&s;ly,
and what we call fair and &s;oftly; not eagerly
pu&s;hing to drive a va&s;t trade, and enjoy but
half of it, rather carry on a middling bu&s;ine&s;s,
and let it be his own.</P>
<P>THERE may be ca&s;es indeed which may have
their exceptions to this general head of advice;
partner&s;hips may &s;ometimes prove &s;ucce&s;sful, and
in &s;ome particular bu&s;ine&s;s they are more ne|ce&s;&s;ary
than in others, and in &s;ome they tell us
that they are ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary; tho' the la&s;t
I can by no means grant; but <HI>be that as it will,</HI>
there are &s;o many ca&s;es more in number, and
of great con&s;equence too, which mi&s;carry by
the &s;everal perplex'd circum&s;tances, differing
tempers, and open knavery of partners, that I
cannot but give it as a friendly advice to all
trade&s;men, if po&s;&s;ible to avoid partner&s;hips of
all kinds.</P>
<P>BUT if the circum&s;tances of trade require part|ner&s;hips,
and the ri&s;que mu&s;t be run, I would
recommend to the trade&s;man not to enter into
partner&s;hips, but under the following circum|&s;tances.</P>
<P>1. NOT to take in any partner who &s;hould
be allowed to carry on any &s;eparate bu&s;ine&s;s,
in which the partner&s;hip is not concerned; de|pend
upon it, whatever other bu&s;ine&s;s your
partner carries on, you run the ri&s;que of it as
<PB N="269" REF="288">
much as you do of your own; and you run the
ri&s;que with this particular circum&s;tance too, that
you have the hazard without the profit or &s;uc|ce&s;s;
that is, without a &s;hare in the profit and
&s;ucce&s;s, which is very unequal and unfair. I
know cunning men will tell you that there may
be provi&s;ion made &s;o effectually in the articles
of partner&s;hip, that the &s;tock in partner&s;hip
&s;hould be concerned in no other intere&s;t or
engagements but its own; but let &s;uch cunning
gentlemen tell me, if the partner meets with a
di&s;appointment in his other undertakings, which
wounds him &s;o deep as to break him, will it
not affect the partner&s;hip thus far? 1. That it
may cau&s;e his &s;tock to be drawn ha&s;tily out, and
perhaps violently too. 2. That it touches and
taints the credit of the partner to be concern'd
with &s;uch a man; and tho' a man's bottom may
&s;upport him, if it be very good, yet 'tis a blow
to him, touches his credit, and makes the world
&s;tand a little at a &s;tay about him, if it be no
more, for a while, till they &s;ee that he &s;hews
him&s;elf upon the <HI>Exchange,</HI> or at his &s;hop-door
again, in &s;pight of all the apprehen&s;ions and
doubts that have been handed about concerning
him. Either of the&s;e are &s;o e&s;&s;ential to the
trade&s;man who&s;e partner thus &s;inks by his own
private breaches, in which the partner&s;hip is
not concern'd, that it is worth while to caution
the trade&s;man again&s;t venturing. And I mu&s;t
add too, that many a trade&s;man has fallen un|der
the di&s;a&s;ter by the partner's affairs thus af|fecting
him, tho' the immediate lo&s;&s;es which
the partner hath &s;uffer'd have not been charg'd
<PB N="270" REF="289">
upon him; and yet I believe 'tis not &s;o ea&s;y to
avoid being fallen upon for tho&s;e debts al&s;o.</P>
<P>IT is certain, as I formerly noted, rumour
will break a trade&s;man almo&s;t at any time; it
matters not at fir&s;t, whether the rumour be true,
or fal&s;e; what rumour can &s;it clo&s;er to a man
in bu&s;ine&s;s, his own per&s;onal misfortunes ex|cepted,
than &s;uch as this, <HI>That his Partner is
broke?</HI> That his Partner has met with a lo&s;s,
&s;uppo&s;e an En&s;urance, &s;uppo&s;e a fall of &s;tocks,
&s;uppo&s;e a bubble or a cheat, or we know not
what, the partner is &s;unk, no man knows whe|ther
the partner&s;hip be concern'd in it, or no;
and while it is not known, every man will &s;up|po&s;e
it, for mankind always think the wor&s;t of
every thing.</P>
<P>WHAT can be a clo&s;er &s;troke at the poor
trade&s;man? He knows not what his partner has
done; he has rea&s;on to fear the wor&s;t; he even
knows not him&s;elf for a while, whether he
can &s;teer clear of the rocks, or no; but &s;oon
recovers, knows his own circum&s;tances, and
&s;truggles hard with the world; pays out his part|ner's
&s;tock, and gets happily over it; and 'tis well
he does &s;o, for that he is at the brink of ruin
mu&s;t be granted; and where one &s;tands and
keeps up his reputation and his bu&s;ine&s;s, there
are twenty would be undone in the &s;ame cir|cum&s;tances.</P>
<P>WHO then would run the venture of a Part|ner,
if it were po&s;&s;ible to avoid it? and who,
if they mu&s;t have a Partner, would have one
that was concern'd in &s;eparate bu&s;ine&s;s, in which
the partner&s;hip was not engaged?</P>
<P><PB N="271" REF="290">
2. IF you mu&s;t have a Partner, always choo&s;e
to have the partner rather under than over
you; by this I mean, take him in for a fifth,
a fourth, or at mo&s;t a third; never for a half:
there are many rea&s;ons to be given for this, be|&s;ides
that of having the greater &s;hare of profits,
<HI>for that I do not give as a rea&s;on here at all;</HI>
but the principal rea&s;ons are the&s;e; fir&s;t, in ca&s;e
of any di&s;a&s;ter in any of the particular &s;uppo&s;ed
accidents, which I have mention'd, and that you
&s;hould be obliged to pay out your partner's &s;tock,
it will not be &s;o heavy, or be &s;o much a blow
to you; and &s;econdly, you pre&s;erve to your&s;elf
the governing influence in your own bu&s;ine&s;s;
you cannot be over-rul'd, over-aw'd, or dogma|tically
told, it &s;hall, or &s;hall not be thus, or thus:
He that takes in a partner for a third has a <HI>part|ner
Servant;</HI> he that takes him in for a half
has a <HI>partner Ma&s;ter;</HI> that is to &s;ay, a Director,
or Preceptor: let your Partner have always a
le&s;&s;er intere&s;t in the bu&s;ine&s;s than your&s;elf, and
be rather le&s;s acquainted with the bu&s;ine&s;s than
your&s;elf, at lea&s;t not better; you &s;hould rather
have a partner to be in&s;tructed, than a partner
to in&s;truct you; for he that teaches you will
always taunt you.</P>
<P>3. IF you mu&s;t have a partner, let him al|ways
be your <HI>junior</HI> rather than your &s;enior;
by this I mean, your junior in the bu&s;ine&s;s, whe|ther
he is &s;o in years, or not: There are many
rea&s;ons why the trade&s;man &s;hould choo&s;e this,
and particularly the &s;ame as the other of taking
him in for a junior or inferior part of the trade;
<HI>that is to &s;ay,</HI> to maintain the &s;uperiority of
<PB N="272" REF="291">
the bu&s;ine&s;s in his own hands; and this I men|tion,
not at all upon account of the pride or
vanity of the &s;uperiority, for that is a trifle com|par'd
to the re&s;t; but that he may have the more
authority to in&s;pect the conduct of his Partner,
in which he is &s;o much and &s;o e&s;&s;entially con|cerned;
and to enquire whether he is doing any
thing, or taking any mea&s;ures dangerous or pre|judicial
to the &s;tock, or to the credit of the
partnership, that &s;o if he finds any thing, he
may re&s;train him, and prevent in time the mi&s;|chief
which would otherwise be inevitable to them both.</P>
<P>THERE are many other advantages to a trade&s;|man,
who is oblig'd to take a partner, by keep|ing
in his own hands the major part of the
trade, which are too long to repeat here; &s;uch
as his being always able to put a check to any
ra&s;h adventure, any launching out into Bubbles
and Projects, and things dangerous to the bu&s;i|ne&s;s;
and this is a very needful thing in a part|ner&s;hip,
that one partner &s;hould be able to cor|rect
the ra&s;h re&s;olves of another in hazardous
ca&s;es.</P>
<P>BY this correcting of ra&s;h mea&s;ures, I mean
over-ruling them with moderation and temper,
for the good of the whole, and for their mu|tual
advantage: The <HI>Romans</HI> frequently had two
Generals, <HI>or Con&s;uls,</HI> to command their armies
in the field; one of which was to be a young
man, that by his vigour and &s;prightly forward|ne&s;s
he might keep up the &s;pirits and courage
of the &s;oldiers, encourage them to fight, and
lead them on by his example; the other an old
<PB N="273" REF="292">
&s;oldier, that by his experience in the military
affairs, age and councils, he might a little abate
the fire of his collegue, and might not only
know how to fight, but know when to fight;
that is to &s;ay, when to avoid fighting; and the
want of this lo&s;t them many a victory, and the
great battle of <HI>Cannae</HI> in particular, in which
80000 <HI>Romans</HI> were killed in one day.</P>
<P>TO compare &s;mall things with great, I may
&s;ay it is ju&s;t &s;o in the affair of trade; you
&s;hould always join a &s;ober grave head, weighed
to bu&s;ine&s;s, and acquainted with trade, to the
young trader, who having been young in the
work will the ea&s;ier give up his judgment to
the other, and who is governed with the &s;olid
experience of the other; and &s;o you join their
ways together, the ra&s;h and the &s;edate, the
grave and the giddy.</P>
<P>AGAIN, if you mu&s;t go into partner&s;hip, be
&s;ure, if po&s;&s;ible, you take no body into partner|ship
but &s;uch as who&s;e circum&s;tances in trade
you are fully acquainted with; &s;uch there are
frequently to be had among relations and neigh|bours,
and &s;uch, if po&s;&s;ible, &s;hould be the man
that is taken into partner&s;hip, that the hazard
of un&s;ound circum&s;tances may be avoided; a
man may el&s;e be taken into partner&s;hip who
may be really Bankrupt even before you take
him in; and &s;uch things have been done, to the
ruin of many an hone&s;t trade&s;man.</P>
<P>IF po&s;&s;ible, let your Partner be a beginner,
that his &s;tock may be rea&s;onably &s;uppos'd to be
free and unentangled; and let him be one that
you know per&s;onally, and his circum&s;tances,
<PB N="274" REF="293">
and did know even before you had any thoughts
of engaging together.</P>
<P>ALL the&s;e cautions are with a &s;uppo&s;ition
that the Partner <HI>mu&s;t</HI> be had; but I mu&s;t &s;till
give it as my opinion, in the ca&s;e of &s;uch trade&s;|men
as I have all along directed my &s;elf to,
that if po&s;&s;ible they &s;hould go on &s;ingle handed
in trade; and I clo&s;e it with this brief note,
re&s;pecting the qualifications of a Partner, <HI>as a|bove,</HI>
that</P>
<P>Next to <HI>no</HI> Partner, <HI>&s;uch a</HI> Partner is be&s;t.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of Hone&s;ty in Dealing; and (1.) Of tel|ling
unavoidable Trading Lies.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_THERE is &s;ome difference between an
<HI>hone&s;t man,</HI> and an <HI>hone&s;t trade&s;man;</HI>
and tho' the di&s;tinction is very nice, yet
I mu&s;t &s;ay it is to be &s;upported: Trade cannot
make a knave an hone&s;t man, for there is a
&s;pecifick difference between hone&s;ty and knave|ry,
which can never be altered by trade or any
other thing; nor can that integrity of mind
which de&s;cribes and is peculiar to a man of ho|ne&s;ty
<PB N="275" REF="294">
be ever abated to a trade&s;man; the recti|tude
of his &s;oul mu&s;t be the &s;ame, and he mu&s;t
not only intend or mean hone&s;tly and ju&s;tly,
but he mu&s;t do &s;o; he mu&s;t act hone&s;tly and
ju&s;tly, and that in all his dealings; he mu&s;t nei|ther
cheat or defraud, over-reach or circumvent
his neighbour, or indeed any body he deals with;
nor mu&s;t he de&s;ign to do &s;o, or lay any plots
or &s;nares to that purpo&s;e in his dealing, as is
frequent in the general conduct of too many,
who yet call them&s;elves <HI>hone&s;t</HI> trade&s;men, and
would take it very ill to have any one tax their
integrity.</P>
<P>BUT after all this is premis'd, there are &s;ome
latitudes, like poetical licences in other ca&s;es,
which a trade&s;man is and mail be allow'd, and
which by the cu&s;tom and u&s;age of trade he may
give him&s;elf a liberty in, which cannot be al|low'd
in other ca&s;es to any man, no, nor to
the trade&s;man him&s;elf out of his bu&s;ine&s;s; I
&s;ay, he may take &s;ome liberties, <HI>but within
bounds;</HI> and whatever &s;ome pretenders to &s;trict
living may &s;ay, yet <HI>that trade&s;man</HI> &s;hall pa&s;s
with me for a very hone&s;t man, notwith&s;tand|ing
the liberty which he gives him&s;elf of this
kind, if he does not take tho&s;e liberties in an
exorbitant manner; and tho&s;e liberties are &s;uch
as the&s;e.</P>
<P>1. THE liberty of asking more than he will
take. I know &s;ome people have condemned
this practice as di&s;hone&s;t, and the <HI>Quakers</HI> for
a time, &s;tood to their point in the contrary pra|ctice,
re&s;olving to ask no more than they would
take, upon any occa&s;ion what&s;oever, and choo&s;ing
<PB N="276" REF="295">
rather to lo&s;e the &s;elling, of their goods, <HI>though
they could afford &s;ometimes to take what was
offer'd,</HI> rather than abate a farthing of the price
they had ask'd; but time and the nece&s;&s;ities of
trade made them wi&s;er, and brought them off
of that &s;everity, and they by degrees came to
ask, and abate, and abate again, ju&s;t as other
hone&s;t trade&s;men do, though not perhaps as
&s;ome do, who give them&s;elves a fuller liberty
that way.</P>
<P>INDEED it is the buyers that make this cu&s;tom
nece&s;&s;ary; for they, <HI>e&s;pecially tho&s;e who buy for
immediate u&s;e,</HI> will <HI>fir&s;t</HI> pretend po&s;itively to tie
them&s;elves up to a limited price, and bid them
a little and a little more, 'till they come &s;o near
the &s;ellers price, that they, <HI>the &s;ellers,</HI> cannot
find in their hearts to refu&s;e it, and then they
are tempted to take it, notwith&s;tanding their
fir&s;t words to the contrary: It is common in|deed
for the trade&s;man to &s;ay, <HI>I cannot abate
any thing,</HI> when yet they do and can afford it;
but the trade&s;man &s;hould indeed not be under|&s;tood
&s;trictly and literally to his words, but as
he means it, <HI>viz.</HI> that he cannot rea&s;onably a|bate,
and that he cannot afford to abate; and
there he may be in earne&s;t, <HI>viz.</HI> that he cannot make
a rea&s;onable profit of his goods, if he is obliged
to abate, and &s;o the meaning is hone&s;t, that
he cannot abate; and yet rather than not take
your money, he may at la&s;t re&s;olve to do it, in
hopes of getting a better price for the remain|der,
or being willing to abate his ordinary gain,
rather than di&s;obligc, the cu&s;tomeer; or being
perhaps afraid he &s;hould not &s;ell off the quan|tity;
<PB N="277" REF="296">
and many &s;uch rea&s;ons may be given, why
he &s;ubmits to fell at a lower price than he re|ally
intended, or can afford to do; and yet he
cannot be &s;aid to be di&s;hone&s;t, or to lie, in
&s;aying at fir&s;t he cannot, or could not abate.</P>
<P>A man in trade is properly to be &s;aid not to
be able to do, what he cannot do to his profit
and advantage; the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> cannot trade to
<HI>Hungary,</HI> and into <HI>Sclavonia;</HI> that is to &s;ay,
they cannot do it to advantage; but 'tis better
for them to trade to <HI>Venice</HI> with their goods,
and let the <HI>Venetians</HI> carry on a trade into <HI>Hun|gary</HI>
thro' <HI>Dalmatia, Croatia, &amp;c.</HI> and the like in
other places.</P>
<P>TO bring it down to particular ca&s;es; one
certain merchant cannot deal in one &s;ort of
goods, which another merchant is eminent for;
the other merchant is as free to the trade as he,
but he cannot do it to profit; for he is unac|quainted
with the trade, and 'tis out of his way,
and therefore he cannot do it.</P>
<P>THUS to the ca&s;e in hand; the trade&s;man
&s;ays, he cannot &s;ell his goods under &s;uch a price,
which in the &s;en&s;e of his bu&s;ine&s;s is true; that
is to &s;ay, he cannot do if to carry on his trade
with the u&s;ual and rea&s;onable advantage which
he ought to expect, and which others make in
the &s;ame way of bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>OR he cannot without under&s;elling the mar|ket,
and undervaluing the goods, and &s;eeming
to under&s;ell his neighbour &s;hop-keepers, to
whom there is a ju&s;tice due in trade, which re|&s;pects
the price of &s;ale; and to under&s;ell is look'd
upon as an unfair kind of trading.</P>
<P><PB N="278" REF="297">
ALL the&s;e and many more are the rea&s;ons,
why a trade&s;man may be &s;aid not to lie, tho'
he &s;hould &s;ay he <HI>cannot</HI> abate, or <HI>cannot</HI> &s;ell
his goods under &s;uch a price, and yet may af|ter
think fit to &s;ell you his goods &s;omething
lower than he &s;o intended, or can afford to do,
rather than lo&s;e your cu&s;tom, or rather than lo&s;e
the &s;elling of his goods, and taking your rea|dy
money, which at that time he may have oc|ca&s;ion
for.</P>
<P>IN the&s;e ca&s;es I cannot &s;ay a &s;hop - keeper
&s;hould be tied down to the literal meaning of
his words in the price he asks, or that he is
guilty of lying in not adhering &s;tiffly to the let|ter
of his fir&s;t demand; tho' at the &s;ame time
I would have every trade&s;man take as little li|berty
that way as may be; and if the buyer
would expect the trade&s;man &s;hould keep &s;trictly
to his demand, they &s;hould not &s;tand and hag|gle,
and skrew the &s;hop-keeper down, bidding
from one penny to another, to a trifle within
his price, &s;o as it were to pu&s;h him to the ex|tremity,
either to turn away his cu&s;tomer for a
&s;ix pence, or &s;ome &s;uch trifle, or to break his
word; as if he would &s;ay, I will force you to
&s;peak fal&s;ly, or turn me away for a trifle.</P>
<P>IN &s;uch ca&s;es, if indeed there is a breach, the
&s;in is the buyer's; at lea&s;t he puts him&s;elf in the
Devil's &s;tead, and makes him&s;elf both tempter
and accu&s;er; nor can I &s;ay that the &s;eller is in that
ca&s;e &s;o much to blame as the buyer: how|ever,
it were to be wi&s;h'd, that on both &s;ides
buying and &s;elling might be carried on without
it; for the buyer as often &s;ays, I won't give a
<PB N="279" REF="298">
farthing more, and yet advances; as the &s;eller
&s;ays, I can't abate a farthing, and yet complies.
The&s;e are, as I call them, <HI>trading lies;</HI> and it
were to be wi&s;h'd, they could be avoided on both
&s;ides; and the hone&s;t trade&s;man does avoid them
as much as po&s;&s;ible, but yet mu&s;t not, <HI>I &s;ay,</HI>
in all ca&s;es be tied up to the &s;trict, literal &s;en&s;e
of that expre&s;&s;ion, <HI>I cannot abate,</HI> as above.</P>
<P>2. ANOTHER trading licence is that of ap|pointings
and promi&s;ing payments of money,
which men in bu&s;ine&s;s are oftentimes forced to
make, and forced to break, without any &s;cruple;
nay, and without any reproach upon their in|tegrity.
Let us &s;tate this ca&s;e as clearly as we
can, and &s;ee how it &s;tands as to the morality of
it, for that is the point in debate.</P>
<P>THE credit n&s;ually given by one trade&s;man to
another, as particularly by the merchant to the
whole&s;ale-man, and by the whole&s;ale-man to
the retailer, is &s;uch, that without tying the buy|er
up to a particular day of payment, they go
on buying and &s;elling, and the buyer pays mo|ney
upon account, as his convenience admits,
and as the &s;eller is content to take it: This oc|ca&s;ions
the merchant, or the whole&s;ale-men, to
go about, as they call it, <HI>a dunning;</HI> among their
dealers, and which is generally the work of e|very
<HI>Saturday.</HI> when the merchant comes to
his cu&s;tomer the whole&s;ale-man, or warehou&s;e-keeper,
for money, he tells him, I have no
money, Sir, I cannot pay you now; if you
call next week, I will pay you: Next week
comes, and the merchant calls again, but 'tis
the &s;ame thing, only the warehou&s;e-man adds,
<PB N="280" REF="299">
Well, I will pay you next week <HI>without fail;</HI>
when the week comes, he tells him he has met
with great di&s;appointments, and he knows not
what to do, but de&s;ires his patience another
week; and when the other week comes, per|haps
he pays him, and &s;o they go on.</P>
<P>NOW what is to be &s;aid for this? In the fir&s;t
place, let us look back to the occa&s;ion: This
warehou&s;e-keeper, or whole&s;ale-man, &s;ells the
goods which he buys of the merchant, I &s;ay, he
&s;ells them to the retailers, <HI>and 'tis for that rea|&s;on
I place it fir&s;t there;</HI> now as they buy in
&s;maller quantities than he did of the merchant,
&s;o he deals with more of them in number, and
he goes about among them the &s;ame <HI>Saturday,</HI>
to get in money that he may pay his merchant,
and he receives his bag full of promi&s;es too e|very
where in&s;tead of money, and is put off from
week to week, perhaps by fifty &s;hop-keepers in
a day; and their &s;erving him thus obliges him
to do the &s;ame to the merchant.</P>
<P>AGAIN, come to the merchant; except &s;ome,
who&s;e circum&s;tances are above it, they are by
this very u&s;age obliged to put off the <HI>Blackwell-hall</HI>
Factor, or the Packer, or the Clothier, or
whoever they deal with, in proportion; and thus
promi&s;es go round for payment, and tho&s;e pro|mi&s;es
are kept or broken as money comes in,
or as di&s;appointments happen; and all this while
here is no breach of hone&s;ty, or parol, no lying,
or &s;uppo&s;ition of it among the trade&s;men, ei|ther
on one &s;ide or other.</P>
<P>BUT let us come, I &s;ay, to the morality of
it. To break a &s;olemn promi&s;e is a kind of
<PB N="281" REF="300">
prevarication, that is certain; there is no com|ing
off of it; and I might enlarge here upon
the fir&s;t fault, <HI>viz.</HI> of making the promi&s;e, which,
&s;ay the &s;trict objectors, they &s;hould not do: But
the trade&s;man's an&s;wer is this; all tho&s;e promi|&s;es
ought to be taken as they are made, namely,
with a contingent dependence upon the circum|&s;tances
of trade, &s;uch as promi&s;es made them by
others who owe them money, or the &s;uppo&s;i|tion
of a week's trade, bringing in money by
retail, as u&s;ual, both of which are liable to fail,
or at lea&s;t to fall &s;hort; and this the per&s;on
who calls for the money knows, and takes the
promi&s;e with tho&s;e attending ca&s;ualties; which
if they fail, he knows the &s;hop-keeper, or who|ever
he is, mu&s;t fail him too.</P>
<P>THE ca&s;e is plain, if the man had the money
in ca&s;h, he need not make a promi&s;e or appoint|ment
for a farther day; for that promi&s;e is no
more or le&s;s than a capitulation for a favour,
a de&s;ire or condition of a week's forbearance, on
his a&s;&s;urance, that if po&s;&s;ible he will not fail to
pay him at the time: It is objected, that the
words <HI>if po&s;&s;ible</HI> &s;hould then be mention'd;
which would &s;olve the morality of the ca&s;e: To
this I mu&s;t an&s;wer, that I own I think it need|le&s;s,
unle&s;s the man, to whom the promi&s;e was
made, could be &s;uppo&s;ed to believe the promi&s;e was
to be perform'd, whether it was po&s;&s;ible
or no; which no rea&s;onable man can be &s;uppo|&s;ed
to do.</P>
<P>THERE is a parallel ca&s;e to this in the ordina|ry
appointment of people to meet either at
<PB N="282" REF="301">
place or time, upon occa&s;ions of bu&s;ine&s;s; two
friends make an appointment to meet the next
day at &s;uch a hou&s;e, &s;uppo&s;e a Tavern at or near
the <HI>Exchange;</HI> one &s;ays to the other, <HI>Do not
fail me at</HI> that time, <HI>for I will certainly be
there;</HI> the other an&s;wers, <HI>I will not fail;</HI> &s;ome
people, who think them&s;elves more religious
than others, or at lea&s;t would be thought &s;o,
object again&s;t the&s;e po&s;itive appointments, and
tell us we ought to &s;ay, I will, if it plea&s;e God,
or I will, life and health permitting; and they
quote the text for it, where our Saviour ex|pre&s;&s;ly
commands to u&s;e &s;uch a caution; and
which I &s;hall &s;ay nothing to le&s;&s;en the force of.</P>
<P>BUT to &s;ay a word to our pre&s;ent cu&s;tom:
Since Christianity is the publick profe&s;&s;ion of the
country, and we are to &s;uppo&s;e we not only
are Chri&s;tians our&s;elves, but that all tho&s;e we
are talking to, or of, are al&s;o Chri&s;tians, we
mu&s;t add, that Chri&s;tianity &s;uppo&s;es we acknow|ledge
that life and all the contingencies of life
are &s;ubjected to the dominion of Providence, and
liable to all tho&s;e accidents which God permits to
befall us in the ordinary cour&s;e of our living
in the world, therefore we expect to be taken
in that &s;en&s;e in all &s;uch appointments; and 'tis
but ju&s;tice to us as Chri&s;tians, in the common
acceptation of our words, that when I &s;ay <HI>I will
certainly</HI> meet my friend at &s;uch a place, and
at &s;uch a time, he &s;hould under&s;tand me to mean,
if it plea&s;es GOD to give me life and health, or
that his Providence permits me to come; or as
the text &s;ays, <HI>if the</HI> Lord <HI>will;</HI> for we all know,
<PB N="283" REF="302">
that unle&s;s the Lord will, I cannot meet, or &s;o
much as live.</P>
<P>NOT to under&s;tand me thus, is as much as to
&s;ay, you do not under&s;tand me to be a Chri&s;ti|an,
or to act like a Chri&s;tian in any thing; and
on the other hand, they that under&s;tand it other|wi&s;e;,
I ought not to under&s;tand them to be
Chri&s;tians: Nor &s;hould I be &s;uppo&s;ed to put, any
neglect or di&s;honour upon the government of
Providence in the world, or to &s;ugge&s;t that I
did not think my&s;elf &s;ubjected to it, becau&s;e I
omitted the words in my appointment.</P>
<P>IN like manner, when a man comes to me
for money, I put him off; that in the fir&s;t place
&s;uppo&s;es I have not the money by me, or can|not
&s;pare it to pay him at that time; if it was
otherwi&s;e, it may be &s;uppos'd I would pay him
ju&s;t then: He is then perhaps impatient, and
asks me when I will pay him, and I tell him
at &s;uch a time; this naturally &s;uppo&s;es, that by
that time I expect to be &s;upplied, &s;o as to be a|ble
to pay; I have current bills, or promi&s;es of
money to be paid me, or I expect the ordinary
takings in my &s;hop or warehou&s;e will &s;upply me
to make good my promi&s;e; thus my promi&s;e is
hone&s;t in its foundation, becau&s;e I have rea&s;on
to expert money to come in to make me in a
condition to perform it; but &s;o it falls out,
contrary to my expectation, and contrary to the
rea&s;on of things, I am di&s;appointed, and can|not
do it; I am then indeed a tre&s;pa&s;&s;er upon my
creditor, whom I ought to have paid, and I am
under affliction enough on that account, and I
&s;uffer in my reputation for it al&s;o; but I can|not
<PB N="284" REF="303">
be &s;aid to be <HI>a liar, an immoral man,</HI> a
man that has <HI>no regard to my promi&s;e,</HI> and the
like; for at the &s;ame time I have perhaps us'd
my utmo&s;t endeavour to do it, but am prevent|ed
by many &s;everal men breaking promi&s;e with
me, and I am$$o way able to help my&s;elf.</P>
<P>IT is objected to this that then I &s;hould not
make-my promi&s;es ab&s;olute, but conditional:
To this I &s;ay, that the promi&s;es, <HI>as is above
ob&s;erv'd,</HI> are really not ab&s;olute, but condition|al
in the very nature of them, and are under|&s;tood
&s;o when they are made, or el&s;e they that
hear them do not understand them as all hu|man
appointments ought to be under&s;tood; I
do confe&s;s, it would be better not to make, an
ab&s;olute promi&s;e at all, but to expre&s;s the con|dition,
or re&s;erve with the promi&s;e, and &s;ay, <HI>I
will</HI> if I can, or I will if people are ju&s;t to me,
and perform their promi&s;es to me.</P>
<P>BUT to this I an&s;wer, the importunity of the
per&s;on, who demands the payment, will not
permit it; nothing &s;hort of a po&s;itive promi&s;e
will &s;atisfy; they never believe the per&s;on in|tends
to perform, if he makes the lea&s;t re&s;erve
or condition in his promi&s;e, tho' at the &s;ame
time they know, that even the nature of the
promi&s;e and the rea&s;on of the promise &s;trongly
implies the condition; I &s;ay, the importunity
of the creditor occa&s;ions the breach, which he
reproaches the debtor with the immorality of.</P>
<P>CUSTOM indeed has driven us beyond the li|mits
of our morals in many things, which trade
makes nece&s;&s;ary, and which we cannot now a|void;
&s;o that if we mu&s;t pretend to go back
<PB N="285" REF="304">
to the literal &s;en&s;e of the command, if our
yea mu&s;t be yea, and our nay nay; if no man
mu&s;t go beyond, or defraud his neighbour; if
our conver&s;ation mu&s;t be without covetou&s;ne&s;s,
and the like, why then it is impo&s;&s;ible for trade&s;|men
to be Chri&s;tians, and we mu&s;t unhinge all
bu&s;ine&s;s, act upon new principles in trade, and go
on by new rules: in &s;hort, we mu&s;t &s;hut up
&s;hop, and leave off trade, and &s;o in many things
we mu&s;t leave off living; for as conversation, is
call'd life, we mu&s;t leave off to conver&s;e; all
the ordinary communication of life is now full
of lying, and what with table-lies, &s;alutation|lies,
and trading-lies, there is no &s;uch thing as
every man &s;peaking truth with his neighbour.</P>
<P>BUT this is a &s;ubject would launch me out
beyond the bounds of a letter, and make a book:
by it&s;elf; I return to the cafe particularly in
hand, promi&s;es of payment of money; men in
trade, I &s;ay, are under this unhappy nece&s;&s;ity,
they are forced to make them, and they are
forced to break them; the violent pre&s;&s;ing and
dunning, and perhaps threatning too, of the cre|ditor,
when the poor &s;hop-keeper cannot com|ply
with his demand, forces him to promi&s;e;
in &s;hort, the importunate creditor will not be
otherwi&s;e put off, and the poor &s;hop-keeper al|mo&s;t
worried, and perhaps a little terrified too,
and afraid of him, is glad to do and &s;ay any
thing to pacify him, and this extorts a promi&s;e,
which when the time comes, he is no more able
to perform than he was before; and this multi|plies
promi&s;es, and con&s;equently breaches, &s;o
much of which are to be placed to the account
<PB N="286" REF="305">
of force, that I mu&s;t acknowledge though the
debtor is to blame, the creditor is too far con|cern'd
in the crime of it to be excus'd; and it
were to be wi&s;h'd, &s;ome other method could be
found out to prevent the evil, and that trade&s;|men
would re&s;olve with more courage to re&s;i&s;t
the importunities of the creditor, be the con&s;e|quence
what it would, rather than break in up|on
their morals, and load their con&s;ciences with
the reproaches of it for all their lives after.</P>
<P>I remember I knew a trade&s;man, who labour|ing
long under the ordinary difficulties of men
embara&s;s'd in trade, and pa&s;t the po&s;&s;ibility of
getting out, and being at la&s;t obliged to &s;top and
call his people together, told me, that after he
was broke, tho' it was a terrible thing to him
at fir&s;t too, as it is to mo&s;t trade&s;men, yet he
thought him&s;elf in a new world, when he was
at a full &s;top, and had no more the terrour up|on
him of bills coming for payment, and cre|ditors
knocking at his door to dun him, and he
without money to pay; he was no more obli|ged
to &s;tand in his &s;hop, and be bullied and
ruffled by his creditors, nay by their apprentices
and boys, and &s;ometimes by Porters and Foot|men,
to whom he was forced to give good
words, and &s;ometimes &s;train his patience to the
utmo&s;t limits; he was now no more obliged to
make promi&s;es, which he knew he could not
perform, and break promi&s;es as fa&s;t as he made
them, and &s;o lie continually both to God and
man; and he added, the ea&s;e of his mind which
he felt upon that occa&s;ion was &s;o great, that it
ballanced all the grief he was in at the general
<PB N="287" REF="306">
di&s;a&s;ter of his affairs; and farther, that even in
the lowe&s;t of his circum&s;tances which followed,
he would not go back to live as he had done,
in the exqui&s;ite torture of want of money to pay
his bills and his duns.</P>
<P>NOR was it any &s;atisfaction to him to &s;ay,
that it was owing to the like breach of promi&s;e
in the &s;hop-keepers, and gentlemen, and people
whom he dealt with, who ow'd him money,
and who made no con&s;cience of promi&s;ing and
di&s;appointing him, and thereby drove him to
the nece&s;&s;ity of breaking his own promi&s;es; for
this did not &s;atisfy his mind in the breaches of
his word, though they really drove him to the
nece&s;&s;ity of it; but that which lay heavie&s;t up|on
him was the violence and clamour of credit|ors,
who would not be &s;atisfied without &s;uch
promi&s;es, even when, he knew, or at lea&s;t be|lieved,
he &s;hould not be able to perform.</P>
<P>NAY, &s;uch was the importunity of one of his
merchants, that when he came for money, and
he was obliged to put him off, and to &s;et him
another day, the merchant would not be &s;atis|fied,
unle&s;s he would &s;wear that he would pay
him on that day without fail; and what &s;aid
you to him, <HI>&s;aid I?</HI> &s;ay to him, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> I
look'd him full in the face, and &s;at me down
without &s;peaking a word, being fill'd with rage
and indignation at him; but, <HI>&s;ays</HI> he, after a
little while he in&s;i&s;ted again, and ask'd me what
an&s;wer I would make him; at which <HI>I &s;mil'd,</HI>
and ask'd him, <HI>if he was in earne&s;t?</HI> he grew
angry then, and ask'd me if I laugh'd at him?
and if I thought to laugh him out of his money?
<PB N="288" REF="307">
ney; I then ask'd him, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> if he really di$
expect I &s;hould &s;wear that I would pay him the
next week, as I propos'd to promi&s;e? he tol$
me, yes he did, and I &s;hould &s;wear it, or pay
him before he went out of my warehou&s;e.</P>
<P>I wonder'd indeed at the di&s;cour&s;e, and a$
the folly of the merchant, who I under&s;tood a|terwards
was a foreigner, and though I thought
he had been in je&s;t at fir&s;t, when he a&s;&s;ur'd me
he was not, I was curious to hear the i&s;&s;ue,
which at fir&s;t he was loth to go on with, be$
cau&s;e he knew it would bring about all the re&s;t;
but I pre&s;sd him to know; &s;o he told me, that
the merchant carried it to &s;uch an height as put
him into a furious pa&s;&s;ion, and knowing he mu&s;t
break &s;ome time or other, he was re&s;olved to
put an end to his being in&s;ulted in that man|ner;
&s;o at la&s;t he ro&s;e up <HI>in a rage,</HI> told the
merchant, that as no hone&s;t man could take &s;uch
an oath, unle&s;s he had the money by him to
pay it, &s;o no hone&s;t man could ask &s;uch a thing
of him, and that &s;ince he mu&s;t have an an&s;wer,
his an&s;wer was, he would not &s;wear &s;uch an
oath for him, nor any man living; and if he
would not be &s;atisfied without it, he might do
his wor&s;t, and &s;o turn'd from him; and know|ing
the man was a con&s;iderable creditor, and
might do him a mi&s;chief, he re&s;olv'd to &s;hut up
that very night, and did &s;o, carrying all his va|luable
goods with him into the Mint; and the
next day he heard that his angry creditor way-laid
him the &s;ame afternoon to arre&s;t: him, but
he was too quick for him, and as he &s;aid, tho'
it almo&s;t broke his heart to &s;hut up his &s;hop,
<PB N="289" REF="308">
yet that being delivere'd from the in&s;ulting tem|per
of his creditor, and the perpetual perplexi|ties
of want of money to pay people when they
dunn'd him, and above all from the nece&s;&s;ity
of making &s;olemn promi&s;es for trifling &s;ums,
and then breaking them again, was to him like
a load taken off of his back when he was weary,
and could &s;tand under it no longer; it was a
terror to him he &s;aid to be continually Lying,
breaking faith with all mankind, and making
promi&s;es which he could not perform.</P>
<P>THIS nece&s;&s;arily brings me to ob&s;erve here, and
it is a little for the ea&s;e of the trade&s;man's mind
in &s;uch &s;evere ca&s;es, that there is a di&s;tinction
to be made in this cafe between wilful premedi|tated
lying, and the nece&s;&s;ity men may be dri|ven
to by their di&s;appointments, and other acci|dents
of their circum&s;tances, to break &s;uch pro|mi&s;es,
as they had made with an hone&s;t intention
of performing them.</P>
<P>HE that breaks a promi&s;e, however, &s;olemnly
made, may be an hone&s;t man; but he that makes
a promi&s;e with a de&s;ign to break it, or with no
re&s;olution of performing it, cannot be &s;o: nay,
to carry it farther, he that makes a promi&s;e,
and docs not do his endeavour to perform it,
or to put him&s;elf into a condition to perform it,
cannot be an hone&s;t man: a promi&s;e once made
&s;uppo&s;es the per&s;on willing to perform it, if it
were in his power, and has a binding influence
upon the per&s;on who made it, &s;o far as his
power extends, or that he can within the reach
of any rea&s;onable ability perform the conditi|ons;
but if it is not in his power to perform it,
<PB N="290" REF="309">
as in this affair of payment of money is often the
$a&s;e, the man cannot be condemn'd as di&s;hone&s;t,
unle&s;s it can be made appear, either,
<Q><LIST>
<ITEM>1. THAT when he made the promi&s;e, he
knew he &s;hould not be able to perform it;
or,</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. THAT he re&s;olv'd when he made the
promi&s;e not to perform it, tho' he &s;hould be
in a condition to do it; and in both the&s;e
ca&s;es the morality of promi&s;ing cannot be ju|&s;tified,
any more than the immorality of not
performing it.</ITEM>
</LIST></Q></P>
<P>BUT on the other hand the per&s;on promi&s;ing,
hone&s;tly intending when he made the appoint|ment
to perform it if po&s;&s;ible, and endeavour|ing
faithfully to be able, but being rendred un|able
by the di&s;appointment of tho&s;e on who&s;e
promi&s;es he depended for the performance of his
own; I cannot &s;ay, that &s;uch a trade&s;man can
be charg'd with Lying, or with any immorality
in promi&s;ing, for the breach was not properly
his own, but the peoples on whom he depended;
and this is justified from what I &s;aid before, <HI>viz.</HI>
that every promi&s;e of that kind &s;uppo&s;es the
po&s;&s;ibility of &s;uch a di&s;appointment, even in the
very nature of its making; for if the man was
not under a moral incapacity of payment, he
would not promi&s;e at all, but pay at the time
he promised: His promi&s;ing then implies, that
he has only &s;omething future to depend upon,
to capacitate him for the payment; that is to &s;ay,
appointments of payment, by other trade&s;men
<PB N="291" REF="310">
who owe him (<HI>that promi&s;es</HI>). the money,
or the daily &s;upply from the ordinary cour&s;e of
his trade, &s;uppo&s;e him a retailer in a &s;hop, and
the like; all which circum&s;tances are &s;ubject to
contingencies and di&s;appointments, and are
known to be &s;o by the per&s;on to whom the
promi&s;e is made; and it is with all tho&s;e con|tangencies
and po&s;&s;ibilities of di&s;appointment,
that he takes or accepts the trade&s;man's promi&s;e,
and forbears him, in hopes that he will be able to
perform; knowing that unle&s;s he receives mo|ney
as above, he cannot.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t however acknowledge, that it is a very
mortifying thing to a trade&s;man, whether we
&s;uppo&s;e him to be one that values his credit in
trade, or his principle as to hone&s;t dealing, to
be obliged to break his word; and therefore
where men are not too much under the hatches
to the creditor, and they can po&s;&s;ibly avoid it,
a trade&s;man &s;hould not make his promi&s;es of
payment &s;o po&s;itive, but rather conditional, and
thereby avoid both the immorality and the di&s;|credit
of breaking his word; nor will any trade&s;|man,
I hope, harden him&s;elf in a carele&s;s for|wardne&s;s
to promi&s;e, without endeavouring or
intending to perform, from any thing &s;aid in this
letter; for be the excu&s;e for it as good as it
will, as to the point of &s;trict hone&s;ty, he can
have but &s;mall regard to his own peace of mind,
or to his own credit in trade, who will not a|void
it as much as po&s;&s;ible.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the cu&s;tomary Frauds of Trade, which
hone&s;t Men allow them&s;lves to practi&s;e,
and pretend to ju&s;tify.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_AS there are trading lies which hone&s;t
men tell, &s;o there are frauds in trade,
which trade&s;men daily practi&s;e, and
which notwith&s;tanding they think are
con&s;i&s;tent with their being hone&s;t men.</P>
<P>IT is certainly true, that few things in na|ture
are &s;imply unlawful and di&s;hone&s;t, but that
all crime is made &s;o by the addition and con|currence
of circum&s;tances; and of the&s;e I am now
to &s;peak; and the fir&s;t I take notice of, is
that of taking and repa&s;&s;ing, or putting off coun|terfeit
or fal&s;e money.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be confe&s;s'd, that calling in the old
money in the time of the late King <HI>William</HI>
was an act particularly glorious to that reign, and
in nothing more than this, that it delivere'd trade
from a terrible load, and trade&s;men from a va&s;t
accumulated weight of daily crime: there was
&s;carce a &s;hopkeeper that had not a con&s;iderable
quantity or bag full of fal&s;e and unpa&s;&s;ble mo|ney
not an apprentice that kept his ma&s;ter's
<PB N="293" REF="312">
ca&s;h, but had an annual lo&s;s, which they &s;ome|times
were unable to &s;upport, and &s;ometimes
their parents and friends were call'd upon for
the deficiency.</P>
<P>THE con&s;equence was, that every raw youth
or unskilful body, that was &s;ent to receive mo|ney,
was put upon by the cunning trade&s;men,
and all the bad money they had was tendred in
payment among the good, that by ignorance or
over&s;ight &s;ome might po&s;&s;ibly be made to pa&s;s;
and as the&s;e took it, &s;o they were not wanting
again in all the artifice and &s;light of hand they
were ma&s;ters of, to put it off again; &s;o that in
&s;hort, people were made Bites and Cheats to one
another in all their bu&s;ine&s;s; and if you went
but to buy a pair of gloves, or &s;tockings, or
any tri&s;le, at a &s;hop, you went with bad money
in one hand, and good money in the other, pro|fering
fir&s;t the bad coin to get it off if po&s;&s;ible,
and then the good to make up the deficiency,
if the other was rejected.</P>
<P>THUS people were daily upon, the catch to
cheat and &s;urpri&s;e one another, if they could;
and in &s;hort, paid no good money for any thing,
if they could help it: And how did we triumph,
if meeting with &s;ome poor raw &s;ervant, or ig|norant
woman, behind a counter, we got off
a counterfeit half crown, or a bra&s;s &s;hilling, and
brought away their goods (which were worth the
&s;aid half crown or &s;hilling, if it had been good)
for a half crown that was perhaps not worth
&s;ixpence; or for a &s;hilling not worth a penny; as if
this was not all one with picking the &s;hop-keep|er's
pocket, or robbing his hou&s;e?</P>
<P><PB N="294" REF="313">
THE excu&s;e ordinarily given for this practice,
was this, <HI>Viz.</HI> that it came to us for good; we
took it, and it only went as it came, we did
not make it, and the like; as if becau&s;e we had
been ba&s;ely cheated by <HI>A.</HI> we were to be al|low'd
to cheat <HI>B;</HI> or that becau&s;e <HI>C.</HI> had rob|bed
our hou&s;e, that therefore we might go and rob <HI>D.</HI></P>
<P>AND yet this was con&s;tantly practi&s;ed at that
time over the whole nation, and by &s;ome of
the hone&s;te&s;t trade&s;men among us, if not by all
of them.</P>
<P>WHEN the old money was, as I have &s;aid,
called in, this cheating trade was put to an end,
and the morals of the nation in &s;ome mea&s;ure
re&s;tored; for in &s;hort, before that, it was almo&s;t
impo&s;&s;ible for a trade&s;man to be an hone&s;t man;
but now we begin to fall into it again, and
we &s;ee the current coin of the kingdom &s;trange|ly
crowded with counterfeit money again, both
gold and &s;ilver, and e&s;pecially we have found
a great deal of counterfeit foreign money, as
particularly <HI>Portugal</HI> and <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> gold, &s;uch as
<HI>Moydores</HI> and <HI>Spani&s;h Pi&s;toles,</HI> which when we
have the misfortune to be put upon with them,
the fraud runs high, and dips deep into our
pockets, the fir&s;t being twenty &s;even &s;hillings,
and the latter &s;eventeen &s;hillings; it is true,
the latter being payable only by weight, we are
not often troubled with them; but the former
going all by tale, great quantities of them, have
been put off among us. I find al&s;o there is a
great encrca&s;e of late of counterfeit money of
our own coin, e&s;pecially of &s;hillings, and the
<PB N="295" REF="314">
quantity encrea&s;ing, To that in a few years more,
if the wicked arti&s;ts are not detected, the griev|ance
may be in proportion as great as it was
formerly, and perhaps harder to be redre&s;s'd,
becau&s;e the coin is not likely to be any more
called in, as the old &s;mooth money was.</P>
<P>WHAT then mu&s;t be done? and how mu&s;t we
prevent the mi&s;chief to con&s;cience and princi|ple
which lay &s;o heavy upon the whole nation
before? The que&s;tion is &s;hort, and the an&s;wer
would be as &s;hort and to the purpo&s;e, if peo|ple
would but &s;ubmit to the little lo&s;s that
would fall upon them at fir&s;t, by which they
would le&s;&s;en the weight of it as they go on,
and it would never encrea&s;e to &s;uch a formi|dable
height as it was at before, nor would it
fall &s;o much upon the poor as it did then.</P>
<P>FIRST, I mu&s;t lay it down as a &s;tated rule or
maxim in the moral part of the que&s;tion, <HI>viz.</HI>
That to put off counterfeit ba&s;e money for
good money, knowing it to be counterfeit, is
di&s;hone&s;t and knavi&s;h.</P>
<P>NOR will it take off from the crime of it,
or le&s;&s;en the di&s;hone&s;ty, to &s;ay, <HI>I took it for
good and current money,</HI> and it goes as it comes;
for as before my having been cheated does not
authori&s;e me to cheat any other per&s;on, &s;o nei|ther
was it a ju&s;t or hone&s;t thing in that per|&s;on
who put the bad money upon me, if they
knew it to be bad; and if it was not hone&s;t in
them, how can it be &s;o in me? If then it came
by knavery, it &s;hould not go by knavery; that
would be indeed to &s;ay it goes as it comes, in
a literal &s;en&s;e that is to &s;ay, it came by inju&s;|tice
<PB N="296" REF="315">
and I &s;hall make it go &s;o: but that will
not do in matters of right and wrong.</P>
<P>THE laws of our country al&s;o arc directly a|gain&s;t
the practice; the law condemns the coin
as illegal; that is to &s;ay, it is not current mo|ney;
or, as the lawyers &s;tile it, it is not lawful
money of <HI>England.</HI> Now every bargain or a|greement
in trade, is in the common and ju&s;t
acceptation, and the language of trade, made
for &s;uch a price or rate, in the current money
of <HI>England;</HI> and tho' you may not exre&s;s it
in words at length, 'tis &s;o under&s;tood, as much
as if it was &s;et down in Writing: if I cheapen a|ny
thing at a &s;hop, &s;uppo&s;e it the lea&s;t toy or
trifle, I ask them, What mu&s;t you have for it?
The &s;hop-keeper an&s;wers, <HI>So much;</HI> &s;uppo&s;e it
were a &s;hilling, what is the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> but this,
<HI>One &s;hilling of lawful money of England?</HI> and
I agree to give that &s;hilling, but in&s;tead of it
give them, a counterfeit piece of lead or tin,
wa&s;h'd over, to make it look like a &s;hilling Do
I pay them what I bargain'd for? Do I give
them one &s;hilling of lawful money of <HI>Eng|land?</HI>
Do I not put a cheat upon them, and
act again&s;t ju&s;tice and mutual agreement?</P>
<P>To &s;ay I took this for the lawful money of
<HI>England?</HI> will not add at all, except it be to
the fraud; for my being deceiv'd does not at
all make it be lawful money: &s;o that in a word,
there can be nothing in that part but encrea&s;|ing
the criminal part, and adding one knave
more to the number of knaves which the na|tion
was encumbred with before.</P>
<P><PB N="297" REF="316">
THE ca&s;e to me is very clear, namely, that
neither by law, ju&s;tice or con&s;cience, can the
trade&s;man put off his bad money after he has
taken it, if he once' knows it to be fal&s;e and
counterfeit money; That it is again&s;t law, is
evident, becau&s;e it is not good and lawful mo|ney
of <HI>England:</HI> it cannot be hone&s;t, becau&s;e you do
not pay in the coin you agreed for, or
perform the bargain you made, or pay in the
coin expected of you; and it is not ju&s;t be|cau&s;e
you do not give a valuable con&s;ideration,
for the goods you, buy really take a trade&s;|man's
goods away, and return dro&s;s and dirt to
him in the room of it.</P>
<P>THE medium I have to propo&s;e in the room
of this, is, that every man who takes a coun|terfeit
piece of money, and knows it to be &s;uch,
&s;hould immediately, de&s;troy it; that is to &s;ay,
de&s;troy it as money, cut it in pieces, or, as I
have &s;een &s;ome hone&s;t trade&s;men do, nail it up
again&s;t a poll, &s;o that it &s;hould go no farther;
it is true, this is &s;inking &s;o much upon him&s;elf,
and &s;upporting the credit of the current coin at
his own expence, and he lo&s;es the whole piece,
and this trade&s;men are very loth to do; but my
an&s;wer is very clear, that thus they ought to
do, and that &s;undry publick rea&s;ons, and &s;eve|ral
publick benefits would follow to the pub|lick,
in &s;ome of which he might have his &s;hare
of benefit hereafter; and if he had not, yet
he ought to do it.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> BY doing thus, he puts a &s;top to the
fraud; that piece of money is no more made
<PB N="298" REF="317">
the in&s;trument to deceive others, which other|wi&s;e
it might do; and tho' it is true that the
lo&s;s is only to the la&s;t man, that is to &s;ay, in
the ordinary currency of the money; yet the
breach upon con&s;cience and principle is to eve|ry
owner thro' who&s;e hands that piece of mo|ney
has fraudulently pa&s;s'd, <HI>that is to &s;ay?</HI> who
have pa&s;s'd it away for good, knowing it to be
counterfeit; &s;o that it is a piece of good &s;er|vice
to the publick to take away the occa&s;ion
and in&s;trument of &s;o much knavery and deceit.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> He prevents a wor&s;e fraud, which
is, the buying and &s;elling &s;uch counterfeit mo|ney;
this was a very wicked, but open trade
in former days, and may in time come to be &s;o
again: fellows went about the &s;treets, crying
<HI>Bra&s;s money, broken or whole;</HI> that is to &s;ay,
they would give good money for bad. It was
at fir&s;t pretended, that they were obliged to cut
it in pieces, and if you in&s;i&s;ted upon it, they
would cut it in pieces before your face; but
they as often got it without that ceremony, and
&s;o made what wicked &s;hifts they could to get it
off again, and many times did put it off for
current money, after they had bought it for a
trifle.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> By this fraud perhaps the &s;ame piece
of money might, &s;everal years after, come into
your hands again, after you had &s;old it for a
trifle, and &s;o you might lo&s;e by the &s;ame &s;hil|ling
two or three times over; and the like of
other people: but if men were obliged to de|moli&s;h
<PB N="299" REF="318">
all the counterfeit money they take,
and let it go no farther, then they would be
&s;ure the fraud could go no farther, nor would
the quantity be ever great at a time; for what|ever
quantity the fal&s;e coiners &s;hould at any time
make, it would gradually le&s;&s;en and &s;ink away,
and not a ma&s;s of fal&s;e and counterfeit coin
appear together, as was formerly the ca&s;e, and
which lo&s;t the nation a va&s;t &s;um of money to
call in.</P>
<P>IT has been the opinion of &s;ome, that a pe|nalty
&s;hould be inflicted upon tho&s;e who offer'd
any counterfeit money in payment; but be&s;ides
that there is already a &s;tatute again&s;t uttering
fal&s;e money, knowing it to be &s;uch; if any o|ther
or farther law &s;hould be made, either to
enforce the &s;tatute, or to have new penalties
added, they would &s;till fall into the &s;ame diffi|culties
as in the act.</P>
<P>1. THAT innocent men would &s;uffer, &s;eeing
many trade&s;men may take a piece of counter|feit
money in tale with other money, and real|ly
and <HI>bona fide</HI> not know it, arid &s;o may offer
it again as innocently as they at fir&s;t took it
ignorantly; and to bring &s;uch into trouble for
every fal&s;e &s;hilling which they might offer to
pay away without knowing it, would be to
make the law be merely vexatious and torment|ing
to tho&s;e again&s;t whom it was not intended,
and at the &s;ame time not to meddle with the
&s;ubtle crafty offender whom it was intended to
puni&s;h, and who is really guilty.</P>
<P><PB N="300" REF="319">
2. SUCH an act would be difficultly executed,
becau&s;e it would &s;till be difficult to know who
did knowingly utter fal&s;e money, and who did
not; which is the difficulty indeed in the pre|&s;ent
law: &s;o that upon the whole, &s;uch a law
would no way an&s;wer the end, nor effectually
di&s;cover the offender; much le&s;s &s;uppre&s;s the
practice. But I am not upon projects and &s;chemes,
'tis not the bu&s;ine&s;s of this undertaking.</P>
<P>BUT a general act, obliging all trade&s;men to
&s;uppre&s;s counterfeit money, by refu&s;ing to put
it off again after they knew it to be counter|feit,
and a general con&s;ent of trade&s;men to do
&s;o; this would be the be&s;t way to put a &s;top
to the practice, the morality of which is &s;o ju&s;t|ly
call'd in que&s;tion, and the ill con&s;equences
of which to trade are &s;o very well known:
nor will any thing but an universal con&s;ent of
trade&s;men, in the hone&s;t &s;uppre&s;&s;ing of coun|terfeit
money, ever bring it to pa&s;s. In the
mean time, as to the di&s;hone&s;ty of the prac|tice,
however popular it is grown at this time,
I think it is out of que&s;tion; it can have nothing
but cu&s;tom to plead for it, which is &s;o far from
an argument, that I think the plea is criminal
in it &s;elf, and really adds to its being a griev|ance,
and calls loudly for a &s;peedy redre&s;s.</P>
<P>ANOTHER trading fraud, which, among ma|ny
others of the like nature, I think worth
&s;peaking of, is the various arts made u&s;e of by
trade&s;men to &s;et off their goods to the eye of
the ignorant buyer.</P>
<P>I bring this in here, becau&s;e I really think 'tis
&s;omething of kin to putting off counterfeit
<PB N="301" REF="320">
money; every fal&s;e glo&s;s put upon our woollen
manufactures, by hot-pre&s;&s;ing, folding, dre&s;&s;ing,
tucking, packing, bleeching, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> what are they
but wa&s;hing over a bra&s;s &s;hilling to make it pa&s;s
for &s;terling? every fal&s;e light, every artificial
&s;ide-window, skie-light, and trunk-light we &s;ee
made to &s;hew the fine Hollands, Lawns, Cam|bricks,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> to advantage, and to deceive the
buyers what is it but a counterfeit coin to cheat
the trade&s;man's cu&s;tomers? an <HI>ignis fatuus</HI> to
impo&s;e upon fools and ignorant people, and
make their goods look finer than they are?</P>
<P>BUT where in trade is there any bu&s;ine&s;s en|tirely
free from the&s;e frauds? and how &s;hall we
&s;peak of them, when we &s;ee them &s;o univer|&s;ally
made u&s;e of? Either they are hone&s;t, or
they are not; if they <HI>are not,</HI> why do we, <HI>I &s;ay,</HI>
univer&s;ally make u&s;e of them? <HI>if they are</HI> hone&s;t,
why &s;o much art, and &s;o much application
to manage them, and to make goods appear
fairer and finer to the eye than they really are?
which in its own nature is evidently a de&s;ign to
cheat, and that in it &s;elf is criminal, and can
be no other.</P>
<P>AND yet there is much to be &s;aid for &s;etting
goods out to the be&s;t advantage too; for in
&s;ome goods, if they are not well dre&s;s'd, well
prefs'd and pack'd, the' goods ate not really
&s;hew'd in a true light; many of our woolen
manufactures, if brought to market rough and
undre&s;s'd, like a piece of cloth not carried to
the fulling or thicking-mill, it does not &s;hew it
&s;elf to a ju&s;t advantage; nay, it does not &s;hew
what it really is? and therefore &s;uch works as
<PB N="202" REF="321">
may be proper for &s;o far letting it forth to the
eye may be nece&s;&s;ary. For example:</P>
<P>THE cloths, &s;tuffs, &s;erges, druggets, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which
are brought to market in the We&s;t: and Nor|thern,
parts of <HI>England,</HI> and in <HI>Norfolk,</HI> as they
are brought without the dre&s;&s;ing and making up,
it may be &s;aid of them that they are brought to
market unfini&s;hed, and they are bought there
again by the whole&s;ale dealers, or cloth-work|ers,
tuckers and merchants, and they carry them
to their ware-hou&s;es and work-hou&s;es, and there
they go thro' divers operations again, and are
fini&s;hed for the market; nor indeed are they
fit to be &s;hew'd till they are &s;o the &s;tuffs are in
the grea&s;e, the cloth is in the oil, they are rough
and foul, and are not dre&s;s'd, and con&s;equent|ly
not fini&s;hed; and as our buyers do not un|der&s;tand
them till they are &s;o dre&s;&s;ed, it is no
proper fini&s;hing the goods to bring them to mar|ket
before, they are not indeed properly &s;aid to
be made till that part is done.</P>
<P>THEREFORE I cannot call all tho&s;e &s;etting
out of goods to be knavi&s;h and fal&s;e; but when
the goods, like a fal&s;e &s;hilling, are to be &s;et out
with fraud and fal&s;e colours, and made &s;mooth
and &s;hining to delude the eye, there, where
they are &s;o, it is really a fraud; and tho' in
&s;ome ca&s;es it extremely differs, yet that does not
excu&s;e the re&s;t by any means.</P>
<P>THE packers and hot-pre&s;&s;ers, tuckers and
cloth-workers are very nece&s;&s;ary people in their
trades, and their bu&s;ine&s;s is to &s;et goods off to
the be&s;t advantage; but it may be &s;aid too, that
their true and proper bu&s;ine&s;s is to make the
<PB N="203" REF="322">
goods &s;hew what really they are, and nothing
el&s;e: it is true, as above, that in the original
dre&s;s, as a piece of cloth or drugget, or &s;tuff
comes out of the hand of the maker, it does
not &s;hew it &s;elf as it really is, nor what it
&s;hould and ought to &s;hew; thus far the&s;e peo|ple
are properly called fini&s;hers of the manu|factures,
and their work is not lawful only, but
it is a doing ju&s;tice to the manufacture.</P>
<P>BUT if by the exuberances of their art they
&s;et the goods in a fal&s;e light, give them a fal&s;e
glo&s;s, a finer and &s;moother &s;urface than really
they have; this is like a painted whore, who
puts on a fal&s;e colour upon her tawny skin to
deceive and delude her cu&s;tomers, and make
her &s;eem the beauty which &s;he has no ju&s;t claim
to the name of.</P>
<P>So far as art is thus u&s;ed to &s;hew the&s;e goods
to be what they really are not, and deceive the
buyer, &s;o far it is a trading fraud, which is an
unju&s;tifiable practice in bu&s;ine&s;s, and which, like
coining of counterfeit money, is making goods
to pa&s;s for what they really are not; and is done
for the advantage of the per&s;on who puts them
off, and to the lo&s;s of the buyer, who is cheat|ed
and deceived by the fraud.</P>
<P>THE making fal&s;e lights, skie-lights, trunks,
and other contrivances to make goods look to
be what they are not, and deceive the eye of
the buyer, the&s;e are all &s;o many bra&s;s &s;hillings
wa&s;h'd over, in order to deceive the per&s;on
who is to take them, and cheat him of his mo|ney;
and &s;o far the&s;e fal&s;e lights are really cri|minal,
they are cheats in trade, and made to
<PB N="304" REF="323">
deceive the world; to make deformity look like
beauty, and to varni&s;h over deficiencies; to make
goods which are ordinary in them&s;elves appear
fine; to make things which are ill made look
well; in a word, they are cheats in them&s;elves,
but being legitimated by cu&s;tom are become a
general practice; the hone&s;te&s;t trade&s;men have
them, and make u&s;e of them, the buyer knows
of it, and &s;uffers him&s;elf to be &s;o impo&s;ed up|on;
and in a word, if it be a cheat, as no doubt
it is, they tell us that yet it is an univer&s;al cheat,
and no body trades without it; &s;o cu&s;tom and
u&s;age makes it lawful, and there is little to be
&s;aid but this, <HI>Si populus vult decipi decipiatur,</HI>
if the people will be cheated, let them be cheat|ed,
or they &s;hall be cheated.</P>
<P>I come next to the &s;etting out their goods
to the buyer by the help of the tongue; and
here I mu&s;t confe&s;s our &s;hop-rhetorick is a &s;trange
kind of &s;peech; it is to be under&s;tood in a man|ner
by it &s;elf; it is to be taken, not in a lati|tude
only, but in &s;uch a latitude as indeed re|quires
as many flourishes to excu&s;e it, as it con|tains
flouri&s;hes in it &s;elf.</P>
<P>THE end of it indeed is corrupt, and it is al|&s;o
made up of a corrupt compo&s;ition, 'tis com|po&s;ed
of a ma&s;s of rattling flattery to the buy|er,
and that fill'd with hypocri&s;y, compliment,
&s;elf-prai&s;es, fal&s;hood, and in &s;hort, a complica|tion
of wickedne&s;s; it is a corrupt means to a
vicious end; and I cannot fee any thing in it
but what a wi&s;e man laughs at, a good man ab|hors
and any man of hone&s;ty avoids as much
as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P><PB N="305" REF="324">
The &s;hop-keeper ought indeed to have a good
tongue, but he &s;hould not make a common
whore of his tongue, and employ it to the
wicked purpo&s;e of abu&s;ing and impo&s;ing upon
all that come to deal with him: There is a
mode&s;t liberty, which trading licen&s;e, like the
poctick licen&s;e, allows to all the trade&s;men of
every kind; but trade&s;men ought no more to
Lie behind the counter, than the par&s;ons ought
to talk trea&s;on in the pulpit.</P>
<P>LET them confine them&s;elves to truth, and
&s;ay what they will: But it cannot be done; a
talking rattling mercer, or draper, or milliner,
behind his counter, would be worth nothing if
he &s;hould confine him&s;elf to that mean &s;illy
thing call'd <HI>Truth;</HI> they mu&s;t Lie, it is in &s;up|port
of their bu&s;ine&s;s, and &s;ome think they can|not
live without it: but I deny that part, and
recommend it, I mean, to the trade&s;men I am
&s;peaking of, to con&s;ider what a &s;candal it is up|on
trade, to pretend to &s;ay that a trade&s;man
cannot live without lying; the contrary to which
may be made appear in almo&s;t every article.</P>
<P>ON the other hand, I mu&s;t do ju&s;tice to the
trade&s;men, and mu&s;t &s;ay, that much of it is ow|ing
to the buyers; they begin the work, and
give the occa&s;ion. It was the &s;aying of a very
good &s;hop-man once upon this occa&s;ion, That
their cu&s;tomers would not be plea&s;ed without
Lying; and why, &s;aid he, did <HI>Solomon</HI> reprove
the buyer? he &s;aid nothing to the &s;hop-keeper;
<HI>It is naught, it is naught, &s;ays the buyer; but
when he goes away, then he boa&s;teth,</HI> Prov. xx.
14. The buyer telling us, adds he, that every
<PB N="306" REF="325">
thing is wor&s;e than it is, forces us, in ju&s;tifying
its true value, to tell them it is better than
it is.</P>
<P>IT mu&s;t be confe&s;s'd, this; verbo&s;e way of
trading is mo&s;t ridiculous, as well as offen&s;ive,
both in Buyer and Seller; and as it adds nothing
to the goodne&s;s or value of the goods; &s;o. I am
&s;ure it adds nothing to the hone&s;ty or good mo|rals
of the trade&s;man, on one &s;ide or other;
but multiplies trading lies on every &s;ide, and
brings a ju&s;t reproach on the integrity of the
dealer, whether he be the Buyer or Seller.</P>
<P>IT was a kind of a &s;tep to the cure of this
Vice in trade, <HI>for &s;uch</HI> it is, that there was an
old office erected in the city of <HI>London,</HI> for
&s;earching and viewing all the goods which were
&s;old in bulk, and could not be &s;earch'd into by
the Buyer; this was call'd <HI>Garbling</HI> and the
Garbler having view'd the goods, and cau&s;ed all
damaged or un&s;ound goods to be taken out,
&s;et his &s;eal upon the cask or bags which
held the re&s;t, and then they were vouch'd to be
marketable; &s;o that when the merchant and
the &s;hop-keeper met to deal, there was no room
for any words about the goodne&s;s of the ware,
there was the Garbler's &s;eal to vouch that they
were marketable and good; and if they were
otherwi&s;e the Garbler was an&s;werable.</P>
<P>THIS re&s;pected &s;ome particular &s;orts of goods
only, and chiefly &s;pices and drugs, and die|&s;tuffs,
and the like; it were well if &s;ome other
method than that of a rattling tongue could be
found out, to a&s;certain the goodne&s;s and value
of goods between, the &s;hop-keeper and the re|tail
<PB N="307" REF="326">
tail buyer, that &s;uch a flux of fal&s;hoods and
untruths might be avoided, as we &s;ee every day
made u&s;e of' to run tap and run down every
thing that is bought or &s;old, and that without
any effect too; for take it one time with ano|ther,
all the &s;hop-keepers lying does not make
the buyer like the goods at all the better;
nor does the buyer's lying make the &s;hop-keeper
&s;ell the cheaper.</P>
<P>IT would be worth while to con&s;ider a little
the language that pa&s;&s;es between the trade&s;man
and his cu&s;tomer over the counter, and put it
into plain home-&s;pun <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> as the meaning
of it really imports; we would not take that
u&s;age if it were put into plain words, it would
&s;et all the &s;hop-keepers and their cu&s;tomers to|gether
by the ears, and we &s;hould have fight|ing
and quarrelling, in&s;tead of bowing and
court &s;ing in every &s;hop; let us hark a little, and
hear how it would found between them; a La|dy
comes into a mercer's &s;hop to buy &s;ome &s;ilks,
or to the lace-man's to buy &s;ilver laces, or the
like, and when &s;he pitches upon a piece which,
&s;he likes, &s;he begins thus:</P>

<P>I might make this dialogue much longer, but
here is enough to &s;et the mercer and the Lady,
both in a flame, and to &s;et the &s;hop in an uproar,
if it were but &s;poken out in plain language, as
above; and yet what is all the &s;hop-dialect le&s;s
or more than this? The meaning is plain; 'tis
nothing but <HI>you lie,</HI> and <HI>you lie;</HI> downright Bil|ling&s;gate,
wrap'd up in &s;ilk and &s;attin, and de|liver'd
dre&s;s'd finely up in better cloaths, than
perhaps it might come dre&s;s'd in between a
Carman and a Porter.</P>
<P>How ridiculous is all the tongue-padding flut|ter
between Mi&s;s <HI>Tawdry</HI> the &s;em&s;tre&s;s, and
<HI>Tattle</HI> my Lady's woman at the <HI>Change</HI> - &s;hop,
when the latter comes to buy any trifle? and
<PB N="309" REF="328">
how many lies indeed creep into every part of
trade, e&s;pecially of retail trade, from the mean|ne&s;t
to the uppermo&s;t part of bu&s;ine&s;s? 'till in
&s;hort 'tis grown &s;o &s;candalous, that I much won|der
the &s;hop-keepers them&s;elves do not leave it
off, for the meer &s;hame of its Simplicity and u&s;e|le&s;ne&s;s.</P>
<P>BUT habits once gotten into u&s;e are very rare|ly
abated, however ridiculous they are; and the
age is come to &s;uch a degree of ob&s;tinate folly,
that nothing is too ridiculous for them, if they
plea&s;e but to make a cu&s;tom of it.</P>
<P>I am not for making my di&s;cour&s;e a &s;atyr up|on
the &s;hop-keepers, or upon their cu&s;tomers;
if I was, I could give a long detail of the arts
and tricks made u&s;e of behind the counter to
wheedle and per&s;uade the Buyer, and manage
the &s;elling part among &s;hop-keepers, and how
ea&s;ily and dextrou&s;ly they draw in their cu&s;tom|ers;
but this is rather work for a ballad and a
&s;ong; my bu&s;ine&s;s is to tell the complete trade&s;|man
how to act a wi&s;er part, to talk to his cu|&s;tomers
like a man of &s;en&s;e and bu&s;ine&s;s, and
not like a Mountebank and his <HI>Merry-Andrew;</HI>
to let him. &s;ee that there is a way of managing
behind a counter, that let the cu&s;tomer be what
or how it will, man or woman, impertinent or
not impertinent; for &s;ometimes, I mu&s;t &s;ay, the
men cu&s;tomers are every jot as impertinent as
the women; but I &s;ay, let them be what they
will, and how they will, let them make as ma|ny
words as they will, and urge the &s;hop-keeper
how they will, he may behave him&s;elf &s;o as to
avoid all tho&s;e impertinences, fal&s;hoods, fooli&s;h
<PB N="310" REF="329">
and wicked excur&s;ions which I complain of, if
he plea&s;es.</P>
<P>IT by no means follows, that becau&s;e the buyer
is fooli&s;h, the &s;eller mu&s;t be &s;o too; that be|cau&s;e
the buyer has a never-cea&s;ing tongue, the
&s;eller mu&s;t rattle as fa&s;t as &s;he; that becau&s;e &s;he
tells a hundred lies to run down his goods, he
mu&s;t tell another hundred no run them up, and
that becau&s;e &s;he belies the goods one way, he
mu&s;t do the &s;ame the other way.</P>
<P>THERE is a happy medium in the&s;e things;
the &s;hop-keeper, far from being rude to his
cu&s;tomers on one hand, or &s;ullen and &s;ilent on
the other, may &s;peak hand&s;omly and mode&s;tly'
of his goods what they de&s;erve, and no other,
may with truth (and good manners too) &s;et forth
his goods as they ought to be &s;et forth; and
neither be wanting to the commodity he &s;ells,
or run out into a ridiculous extravagance of
words, which have neither truth of fact or. Ho|ne&s;ty
of de&s;ign in them.</P>
<P>NOR is this middle way of management at all
le&s;s likely to &s;ucceed, if the cu&s;tomers have a|ny
&s;hare of &s;en&s;e in them, or the goods he
&s;hews any merit to recommend them; and I
mu&s;t &s;ay, I believe this grave middle way of
di&s;cour&s;ing to a cu&s;tomer, is generally more ef|fectual,
and more to the purpo&s;e, and more to
the reputation of the &s;hop-keeper, than a &s;torm
of words, and a mouthful of common &s;hop-language,
which makes a noi&s;e, but has little
in it to plead, except to here and there a fool
that can no otherwi&s;e be prevail'd with.</P>
<P><PB N="311" REF="330">
IT would be a terrible &s;atyr upon the Ladies,
to &s;ay that they will not be plea&s;ed or engaged
either with good wares, or good pennyworths,
with rea&s;onable good language, or good manners,
but they mu&s;t have the addition of long ha|rangues,
&s;imple, fawning and flattering language,
and a flux of fal&s;e and fooli&s;h words, to &s;et off
the goods, and wheedle them in to lay out
their money; and that without the&s;e they are
not to be plea&s;ed.</P>
<P>BUT let the trade&s;man try the hone&s;t part,
and &s;tand by that, keeping a &s;tock of fa&s;hion|able
and valuable goods in his &s;hop to &s;hew,
and I dare &s;ay he will run no venture, not
need he fear cu&s;tomers; if any thing calls for
the help of noi&s;e, and rattling words, it mu&s;t
be mean and &s;orry, unfa&s;hionable and ordinary
goods, together with weak and &s;illy buyers;
and let the buyers that chance to read this re|member,
that whenever they find the &s;hop-keeper
begins his noi&s;e, and makes his fine
&s;peeches, they ought to &s;uppo&s;e he (the &s;hop|keeper)

<HEAD>LETTER. XIX.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of Fine Shops, and Fine Shews.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_IT is a modern cu&s;tom, and wholly un|known
to our ance&s;tors, who yet un|der&s;tood
trade, in proportion to the
trade they carried on, as well as we
do, to have trade&s;men lay out two thirds
of their fortune in fitting up their &s;hops.</P>
<P>BY fitting up, I do not mean furni&s;hing their?
&s;hops with wares and goods to &s;ell; for in that
they came up to us in every particular, and per|haps
went beyond us too; but in painting and
gilding, fine &s;helves, &s;hutters, boxes, gla&s;s-doors,
&s;a&s;hes, and the like, in which they tell us now,
'tis a &s;mall matter to lay out two or three hun|dred
pounds, nay five hundred pounds to fit up
a Pa&s;try-Cook's, or a Toy-&s;hop.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t inference to be drawn from this
mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be, that this age mu&s;t have more
fools than the la&s;t; for certainly fools only are
mo&s;t taken with &s;hews and out&s;ides.</P>
<P>IT is true, that a fine &s;hew of goods will
bring cu&s;tomers; and it is not a new cu&s;tom,
but a very old one, that a new &s;hop very well
furni&s;hed goes a great way to bringing a trade;
for the proverb was, and &s;till is, very true, <HI>that
<PB N="313" REF="332">
every body has a penny for a new &s;hop?;</HI> but
that a fine &s;hew of &s;helves and gla&s;s windows
&s;hould bring cu&s;tomers, that was never made a
rule in trade 'till now.</P>
<P>AND yet even now I &s;hould not except &s;o
much again&s;t it, if it was not carried on to &s;uch
an exce&s;s, as is too much for a middling trade&s;|man
to bear the expence of; in this therefore
it is made not a grievance only, but really &s;can|dalous
to trade; for now a young beginner has
&s;uch a tax upon him before he begins, that he
mu&s;t &s;ink perhaps a third part, nay, a half part
of his &s;tock, in painting and gilding, wain&s;cot|ing
and glazing, before he begins to trade, nay,
before he can open his &s;hop; As they &s;ay of
building a water-mill, two thirds of the expence
lies under the water; and when the poor trade&s;|man
comes to furni&s;h his &s;hop, and lay in his
&s;tock of goods, he finds a great hole made in
his ca&s;h to the workmen, and his &s;hew of goods,
on which the life of his trade depends, is fain
to be le&s;&s;en'd to make up his &s;hew of boards,
and gla&s;s to lay them in.</P>
<P>NOR is this heavy article to be abated upon
any account; for if he does not make a good
&s;hew, he comes abroad like a mean ordinary fel|low,
and no body of fa&s;hion comes to his &s;hop;
the cu&s;tomers are drawn away by the pictures
and painted &s;helves, tho' when they come there,
they are not half &s;o well fill'd, as in other pla|ces,
with goods fit for a trade; and how in|deed
&s;hould it be otherwi&s;e? the Joiners and
Painters, Gla&s;iers and Carvers, mu&s;t have all
ready money; the Weavers and Merchants may
<PB N="314" REF="333">
give credit, their goods are of &s;o much le&s;s; mo|ment
to the &s;hop-keeper, that they mu&s;t tru&s;t;
but the more important &s;hew mu&s;t be fini&s;h'd
fir&s;t, and paid fir&s;t and when that has made a
deep hole in the trade&s;man's &s;tock, then the
remainder may be &s;par'd to furni&s;h the &s;hop with
goods and the merchant mu&s;t tru&s;t for the re&s;t.</P>
<P>IT will hardly be believed in ages to come,
when our po&s;terity &s;hall be grown wi&s;er by our
lo&s;s, and, as I may truly lay, at our expence,
that a Pa&s;try-Cook's &s;hop, which twenty pounds
would effectually furni&s;h at a time. with all need|ful
things for &s;ale; nay, except on an extraordi|nary
&s;hew, as on Twelfth-day at night for cakes,
or upon &s;ome great Fea&s;t, twenty, pounds can
hardly be laid out at one time in goods for &s;ale,
yet that fitting up one of the&s;e &s;hops &s;hould

<ITEM>2. Twenty pounds in &s;tock for pies, and

300 l. expence to fit up the &s;hop, and

extravagance in fitting up a Cutler's &s;hop, <HI>An|glic&egrave;</HI>
a Toy-man, which arc now come up to

<P><PB N="316" REF="335">
As to the &s;hops of the more con&s;iderable
trades, they all bear a proportion of the humour
of the times, but do not call for &s;o loud a re|mark;
leaving therefore the ju&s;t reflection which
&s;uch things call for, let me bring it home to
the young Trade&s;man, to whom I am directing
this di&s;cour&s;e, and to whom I am de&s;irous to
give &s;olid and u&s;eful hints for his in&s;truction; I
would recommend it to him to avoid all &s;uch
needle&s;s expences, and rather endeavour to fur|ni&s;h
his &s;hop with goods, than to paint and gild
it over, to make it fine and gay; let it invite
cu&s;tomers rather by the well-fill'd pre&s;&s;es and
&s;helves, and the great choice of rich and fa&s;hi|onable
goods, that one cu&s;tomer being well
&s;erv'd may bring another; and let him &s;tudy to
bring his &s;hop into reputation for good choice
of wares, and good attendance on his cu&s;tom|ers?
and this &s;hall bring a throng to him much
better, and of much better people, than tho&s;e
that go in merely for a gay &s;hop.</P>
<P>LET the &s;hop be decent and hand&s;ome, &s;pa|cious
as the place will allow, and let &s;ome|thing
like the face of a ma&s;ter be always to be
&s;een in it; and, if po&s;&s;ible, be always bu&s;y, and
doing &s;omething in it, that may look like be|ing
employ'd; this takes as much with the wi|&s;er
ob&s;ervers of &s;uch things, as any other ap|pearance
can do.</P>
<P>I have heard of a young Apothecary, who
&s;etting up in a part of the Town, where he had
not much acquaintance, and fearing much, whe|ther
he &s;hould get into bu&s;ine&s;s, hir'd a man
acquainted with &s;uch bu&s;ine&s;s and made him
<PB N="317" REF="336">
be every morning between five and &s;ix, and of|ten
late in the evenings, working very hard at the
great mortar; pounding and beating, tho' he had
nothing to do with it, but beating &s;ome very
needle&s;s thing, that all his neighbours might hear
it, and find that he was in full employ, being at
work, early and late, and that consequently he
mu&s;t be a man of va&s;t bu&s;ine&s;s, and have a great
practice; and the thing was well laid, and took
accordingly; for the neighbours believing he
had bu&s;ine&s;s, brought bu&s;ine&s;s to him; and the
reputation of having a trade, made a trade for
him.</P>
<P>THE ob&s;ervation is ju&s;t; a &s;hew may bring
&s;ome people to a &s;hop, but 'tis the &s;ame of bu|&s;ine&s;s
that brings bu&s;ine&s;s; and nothing rai&s;es
the &s;ame of a &s;hop like its being a &s;hop of good
trade already; then people go to it, becau&s;e they
think other people go to it, and becau&s;e they
think there is good choice of goods; their gild|ing
and painting may go a little way, but 'tis the
having a &s;hop well fill'd with goods, having
good choice to fell, and &s;elling rea&s;onable, the&s;e
are the things that bring a trade, and a trade
thus brought will &s;tand by you, and la&s;t; for
fame of trade brings trade any where.</P>
<P>IT is a &s;ign of the barrenne&s;s of the peoples
fancy, when they are &s;o ea&s;ily taken with &s;hews
and out&s;ides of things: Never was &s;uch paint|ing
and gilding, &s;uch &s;a&s;nings and looking-gla&s;|&s;es
among the &s;hop-keepers, as there is now; and
yet trade flouri&s;h'd more in former times by a
great deal than it does now, if we may believe
the report of very hone&s;t and under&s;tanding
<PB N="318" REF="337">
men; the rea&s;on; I think, cannot be to the
credit of the pre&s;ent age, nor is it to the di&s;|credit
of the former; for they carried on their
trade with le&s;s gaiety, and with le&s;s expence
than we do now.</P>
<P>MY advice to a young trade&s;man is to keep
the &s;afe middle between the&s;e extremes; &s;ome|thing
the times mu&s;t be humour'd in, becau&s;e
fa&s;hion and cu&s;tom mu&s;t be followed; but let
him con&s;ider the depth of his &s;tock, and not
lay out half his e&s;tate upon fitting up his &s;hop,
and then leave but the other half to furni&s;h it;
'tis much better to have a Full &s;hop, than a Fine
&s;hop; and a hundred pounds in goods will make
a much better &s;hew than a hundred pounds worth
of painting and carv'd work; 'tis good to make
a &s;hew, but not to be All &s;hew.</P>
<P>IT is true, that painting and adorning a &s;hop
&s;eems to intimate, that the trade&s;man has a large
&s;tock to begin with, or el&s;e they &s;ugge&s;t he
would not make &s;uch a &s;hew; hence the young
&s;hop-keepers are willing to make a great &s;hew,
and beautify, and paint, and gild, and carve, becau&s;e
they would be thought to have a great &s;tock
to begin with; but let me tell you, the reputa|tion
of having a great &s;tock is ill purchas'd, when
Half your &s;tock is laid out to make the world be|lieve
it; that is, <HI>in &s;hort,</HI> reducing your&s;elf to a
&s;mall &s;tock to have the world believe you have
a great one; in which by the way, you do no le&s;s
than barter the real &s;tock for the imaginary, and
give away your &s;tock to keep the name of it
only.</P>
<P><PB N="319" REF="338">
I take this indeed to be a <HI>French</HI> humour,
or a &s;pice of it turn'd <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and indeed we
are famous for this, that when' we do mimick
the <HI>French,</HI> we generally do it to our hurt, and
over-do the <HI>French</HI> them&s;elves.</P>
<P>THE French nation are eminent for making
a fine out&s;ide, when perhaps within they want
nece&s;&s;aries; and indeed a gay &s;hop and a mean
&s;tock is &s;omething like the <HI>Frenchman</HI> with his
laced ruffles, without a &s;hirt: I cannot but
think a well furni&s;h'd &s;hop with, a moderate out|&s;ide
is much better to a trade&s;man, than a fine
&s;hop and few goods; I am &s;ure it will be much
more to his &s;atisfaction, when he ca&s;ts up his
year's account, for his fine &s;hop will weigh but
&s;orrily in his account of profit and lo&s;s; 'tis all
a dead article, 'tis funk out of his fir&s;t money,
before he makes a &s;hilling profit, and may be
&s;ome years a recovering, as trade may go with
him.</P>
<P>IT is true that all the&s;e notions of mine in
trade are founded upon the principle of fruga|lity
and good husbandry; and this is a principle
&s;o di&s;agreeable to the times, and &s;o contrary to
the general practice, that we &s;hall find very few
people to whom it is agreeable: But let me tell
my young trade&s;men, that if they mu&s;t bani&s;h
frugality and good husbandry, they mu&s;t at the
&s;ame time bani&s;h all expectation of growing
rich by their trade: It is a maxim in commerce,
that money gets money, and they that will not
frugally lay up their gain, in order to encrea&s;e
their gain, mu&s;t not expect to gain as they might
orherwi&s;e do; frugality may be out of fa&s;hion
<PB N="320" REF="339">
among the gentry, but if It coined to be &s;o a|mong
trade&s;men, we &s;hall &s;oon &s;ee that weal|thy
trade&s;men will be hard to find; for they
who will not &s;ave as well as gain mu&s;t expect
to go out of trade as lean as they began.</P>
<P>SOME people tell us indeed in many ca&s;es,
e&s;pecially in trade, that putting a good face up|on
things goes as far as the real merit of the
things them&s;elves; and that a fine, painted, gild|ed
&s;hop, among the re&s;t, has a great influence
upon the people, draws cu&s;tomers, and brings
trade; and they run a great length in this di&s;|cour&s;e
by &s;atyri&s;ing on the blindne&s;s and folly
of mankind, and how the world are to be ta|ken
in their own way; and &s;eeing they are to
be deluded and impo&s;ed upon in &s;uch ail inno|cent
way, they ought to be &s;o far deluded and
impo&s;ed upon, alluding to the old proverbial,
&s;aying, <HI>Si populus vult decipi, decipiatur;</HI> that
'tis no fraud, no crime, and can neither be a|gain&s;t
con&s;icience or prudence; for if they are
pleas'd with a &s;hew, why &s;hould they not have,
it? <HI>and the like.</HI></P>
<P>THIS way of talking is indeed plau&s;ible; and
were the fact true, there might be more in it,
than I think there is: But I do not grant that
the world is thus to be deluded; and that the
people do follow this rule in general, I mean,
to go always to a fine &s;hop to lay out their mo|ney;
perhaps in &s;ome ca&s;es it may be &s;o, where
the women, and the weake&s;t of the &s;ex too, are
chiefly concern'd; or where the fops and fools
of the age re&s;ort; and as to tho&s;e few, they
that are willing to be &s;o impos'd upon, let them
have it.</P>
<P><PB N="321" REF="340">
BUT I do not &s;ee, that even this extends any
farther than to a few Toy-&s;hops, and Pa&s;try-Cooks;
and the cu&s;tomers of both the&s;e are
not of credit &s;ufficient, I think, to weigh in
this ca&s;e; we may as well argue for the fine
habits at a <HI>Puppet-&s;hew</HI> and a <HI>Rope-dan|cing,</HI>
becau&s;e they draw the Mob about them;
but I cannot think, after you go but one de|gree
above the&s;e, the thing is of any weight,
much le&s;s does it bring credit to the trade&s;man,
whatever it may do to the &s;hop.</P>
<P>THE credit of a trade&s;man re&s;pects two &s;orts
of people, <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> the merchants, or whole&s;ale
men, or <HI>makers,</HI> who &s;ell him his goods, or
the cu&s;tomers, who come to his &s;hop to buy.</P>
<P><HI>The fir&s;t</HI> of the&s;e are &s;o far from valuing him
upon the gay appearance of his &s;hop, that they
are often the fir&s;t that take an offence at it,
and &s;u&s;pect his credit upon that account; their
opinion upon, a trade&s;man, and his credit with
them, is rais'd quite another way, namely, by
his current pay, diligent attendance, and hone&s;t
figure; <HI>the gay &s;hop</HI> does not help him at all
there, but rather the contrary.</P>
<P>AS to <HI>the latter,</HI> though &s;ome cu&s;tomers may
<HI>at fir&s;t</HI> be drawn by the gay appearance and
fine gilding and painting of a &s;hop, yet it is
the well &s;orting a &s;hop with goods, and the
&s;elling good pennyworths that will bring trade,
e&s;pecially after the &s;hop has been open &s;ome
time; this, and this only, e&s;tabli&s;hes the man
and the credit of the &s;hop.</P>
<P>TO conclude; the credit rais'd by the fine
&s;hew of things is al&s;o of a differing kind from
<PB N="322" REF="341">
the &s;ub&s;tantial reputation of a trade&s;man; 'Tis
rather the credit of the &s;hop, than of the man;
and in a word, it is no more or le&s;s than a net
&s;pread to catch fools; 'tis a bait to allure and
deceive, and the trade&s;man generally intends it
&s;o; He intends that the ca&s;tomers &s;hall pay for
the gilding and painting his &s;hop, and 'tis the
u&s;e he really makes of it, <HI>viz.</HI> that his &s;hop
looking like &s;omething eminent, he may fell
dearer than his neighbours: who, and what
kind of fools can &s;o be drawn in, it is ea&s;y
to de&s;cribe; but &s;atyr is none of our bu&s;ine&s;s
here.</P>
<P>ON the contrary, the cu&s;tomers, who are the
&s;ub&s;tan&s;tial dependence of a trade&s;man's &s;hop,
are &s;uch as are gain'd and pre&s;erv'd by good
u&s;age, good pennyworths, good wares, and good
choice; and a &s;hop that has the reputation of
the&s;e four, like good wine that needs no bu&s;h,
needs no painting and gilding, no carv'd works
and ornaments; it requires only a diligent ma|&s;ter
and a faithful &s;ervant, and it will never want
a trade.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XX.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Trade&s;man's keeping his Book,
and ca&s;ting up his Shop.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_IT Was an antient and laudable cu&s;tom
with trade&s;men in <HI>England</HI> always to
ballance their accounts of &s;tock, and
of profit and lo&s;s, at lea&s;t once every
year; and generally it was done at <HI>Chri&s;tmas,</HI>
or New year's tide, when they could always
tell whether they went backward or forward,
and how their affairs &s;tood in the world; and
tho' this good cu&s;tom is very much lo&s;t among
trade&s;men at this time, yet there are a great ma|ny
that do &s;o &s;till, and they generally call it,
<HI>ca&s;ting up &s;hop;</HI> to &s;peak the truth, the great
occa&s;ion of omitting it has been from the ma|ny
trade&s;men, who do not care to look into
things, and who fearing their affairs are not
right, care not to know how they go at all,
<HI>good</HI> or <HI>bad;</HI> and when I &s;ee a trade&s;man that
does not ca&s;t up once a year, I conclude that
trade&s;man to be in very bad circum&s;tances, that
at lea&s;t he fears he is &s;o, and by con&s;equence
cares not to enquire.</P>
<P><PB N="324" REF="343">
As ca&s;ting up. the &s;hop is the way to know
every year whether he goes backward, or for|ward,
and is the trade&s;man's particular &s;atisfacti|on,
&s;o he mu&s;t ca&s;t up his books too, or el&s;e
it will be very ominous to the trade&s;man's cre|dit.</P>
<P>NOW, in order to doing this effectually once
a year, 'tis needful the trade&s;man &s;hould keep
his books always in order; his day-book duly
po&s;ted, his ca&s;h duly ballanced, and all peoples
accounts always fit for a view; he that delights
in his trade will delight in his books; and, as
I &s;aid, that he that will thrive mu&s;t diligently
attend, his &s;hop, or warehou&s;e, and take up his
delight there, &s;o, I &s;ay now, he mu&s;t al&s;o dili|gently
keep his books, or el&s;e he will never
know whether he thrives, or no.</P>
<P>EXACT keeping his books is one e&s;&s;ential part
of a trade&s;man's pro&s;perity; the books are the
regi&s;ter of his e&s;tate, the index of his &s;tock; all
the trade&s;man has in the world mu&s;t be found
in the&s;e three articles, or &s;ome of them.</P>
<Q><L>Goods in the &s;hop;</L>
<L>Money in ca&s;h;</L>
<L>Debts abroad.</L></Q>
<P>The &s;hop will at any time &s;hew <HI>the fir&s;t</HI> of
the&s;e upon a &s;mall &s;top to ca&s;t it up; the ca&s;h-che&s;t
and Bill-box will &s;hew <HI>the &s;econd at demand;</HI>
and the Ledger when polled will &s;hew <HI>the la&s;t;</HI>
&s;o that a trade&s;man can at any time, at a week's
notice, ca&s;t up all the&s;e three; and then, exa|mining
his accounts, to take the ballance, which
is a real trying what he is worth in the world.</P>
<P><PB N="325" REF="344">
IT cannot be &s;atisfactory to any trade&s;man to
let his books go un&s;ettled, and unca&s;t up; for
then he knows nothing of him&s;elf, or of his
circum&s;tances in the world; the books can tell
him at any time what his condition is, and will
&s;atisfy him what is the condition of his debts
abroad.</P>
<P>IN order to his regular keeping his books,
&s;everal things might be &s;aid very u&s;eful for the
trade&s;man to con&s;ider;</P>
<Q><LIST>
<ITEM>I. EVERY thing done in the whole circumfer|ence
of his trade mu&s;t be &s;et down in a
book, except the retail-trade; and this is
clear, if the goods are not in bulk, then,
the money is in ca&s;h, and &s;o the &s;ub&s;tance
will be always found either there, or &s;ome|where
el&s;e; for if it is neither in the &s;hop,
nor in the ca&s;h, nor in the books, it mu&s;t he
&s;tolen and lo&s;t.</ITEM>
<ITEM>II. As every thing done mu&s;t be &s;et down
in the Books, &s;o it &s;hould be done at the
very time of it; all goods &s;old mu&s;t be en|tred
in the books before they are &s;ent out
of the hou&s;e; goods &s;ent away and not
entred are goods lo&s;t; and he that does
not keep an exact account of what goes
out and comes in, can never &s;wear to his
books, or prove his debts, if occa&s;ion calls
for it.</ITEM>
</LIST></Q>
<P>I am not going to &s;et down rules here for
Book-keeping, or to teach the trade&s;man how
<PB N="326" REF="345">
to do it, but I am &s;hewing the nece&s;&s;ity and
u&s;efulne&s;s of doing it at all: That trade&s;man,
who keeps no books, may depend upon it, he
will e're long keep no trade, unle&s;s he re&s;olves
al&s;o to give no credit: He that gives no tru&s;t,
and takes no tru&s;t, either by whole&s;ale or by
retail, and keeps his ca&s;h all him&s;elf, may in|deed
go on without keeping any books at all,
and has nothing to do, when he would know
his e&s;tate, but to ca&s;t up his &s;hop and his ca&s;h,
and &s;ee how much they amount to, and that
is his whole and neat e&s;tate; for as he owes
nothing, &s;o no body is in debt to him, and
all his e&s;tate is in his &s;hop; but I &s;uppo&s;e, the
trade&s;man that trades wholly thus, is not yet
born, or if there ever was any &s;uch, they are all
dead.</P>
<P>A Trade&s;man's books, like a Chri&s;tian's con|&s;cience,
&s;hould always be kept clean and clear;
and he that is not careful of both will give but
a &s;ad account of him&s;elf either to GOD or <HI>Man.</HI>
It is true that a great many trade&s;men, and e&s;pe|cially
&s;hop-keepers, under&s;tand but little of book-keeping,
but 'tis as true that they all under&s;tand
&s;omething of it, or el&s;e they will make but
poor work of &s;hop-keeping.</P>
<P>I knew a trade&s;man that could not write,
and yet he &s;upplied the defeat with &s;o many
ingenious knacks of his own, to &s;ecure the account
of what people ow'd him, and was &s;o exact in
doing it, and then took &s;uch care to have but
very &s;hort accounts with any body, that he
brought up his method to be every way an equi|valent
to writing; and, as I often told him,
<PB N="327" REF="346">
with half the &s;tudy and application that tho&s;e
things co&s;t him, he might have learn'd to write,
and keep books too: He made notches upon
&s;ticks for all the middling &s;ums, and &s;cor'd
with chalk for le&s;&s;er things; he had drawers
for every particular cu&s;tomer's name, which his
memory &s;upplied for he knew every particular
drawer, tho' he had a great many, as well as if
their faces had been painted upon them; he
had innumerable figures to &s;ignify what he would
have written, if he could s and his &s;helves and
boxes always put me in mind of the <HI>Eg yptian</HI>
Hieroglyphicks, and no body under&s;tood them,
or any thing of them but him&s;elf.</P>
<P>IT was an odd thing to &s;ee him, when a
country-chap, came up to &s;ettle accounts with,
him; he would go to a drawer directly, among
&s;uch a number as was amazing; in that draw|er
was nothing but little pieces of &s;plit &s;ticks,
like laths, with chalk-marks on them, all as un|intelligible
as the &s;igns of the Zodiack are to
an old School-mi&s;tre&s;s that teaches the Horn|book
and Primmer, or as <HI>Arabick</HI> or <HI>Greek</HI> is
to a Plowman; every &s;tick had notches on one
&s;ide for &s;ingle pounds, on the other &s;ide for tens
of pounds, and &s;o higher; and the length and
breadth al&s;o had its &s;ignification, and the colour
too; for they were painted in &s;ome places with
one colour, and in &s;ome places with, another; by
which he knew what goods had been deliver'd
for the money: and his way of ca&s;ting up was
very remarkable, for he knew nothing of fi|gures;
but he kept &s;ix &s;poons in a place on
purpo&s;e, near his counter, which he took out
<PB N="328" REF="347">
when he had occa&s;ion to ca&s;t up any &s;um, and
laying the &s;poons on a row before him, he
counted upon them thus:
<Q>One, two, three, and another; one odd &s;poon, and t'other.</Q></P>
<P>BY this he told up to &s;ix; if he had any occa|&s;ion
to tell any farther, he began again, as we
do after the number ten in our ordinary nu|meration;
and by this method, and running
them up very quick, he would count any num|ber
under 36, which was &s;ix &s;poons of &s;ix &s;poons,
and then by the &s;trength of his head he coa'd
number as many more as he plea&s;ed, multiply|ing
them always by &s;ix's, but never higher.</P>
<P>I give this in&s;tance to &s;hew how far the ap|plication
of a man's head might go to &s;upply
the defect; but principally to &s;hew (and it does
abundantly &s;hew it) what an ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity
there is for a trade&s;man to be very diligent and
exact in keeping his books; and what pains
tho&s;e who understand their bu&s;ine&s;s will always
take to do it.</P>
<P>THIS trade&s;man was indeed a country &s;hop-keeper,
but he was &s;o con&s;iderable a dealer, that
he became Mayor of the city which he lived in,
(for it was a city, and that a con&s;iderable city
too,) and his po&s;terity-have been very con&s;idera|ble
traders in the &s;ame city ever &s;ince, and they
&s;hew their great grandfather's &s;ix counting &s;poons
and his hieroglyphicks to this day.</P>
<P>AFTER &s;ome time, the old <HI>trade&s;man</HI> bred up
two of his &s;ons to his bu&s;ine&s;s, and the young
<PB N="329" REF="348">
men having learned to write, brought books in|to
the compting-hou&s;e, things their father had
never u&s;ed before; but the old man kept to
his old method for all that, and would ca&s;t up
a &s;um, and make up an account with his &s;poons
and his drawers,, as &s;oon as they could with
their pen and ink, if it was not too full of &s;mall
articles, and that he had always avoided
in his bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>HOWEVER, as I have &s;aid above, this evident|ly
&s;hews the nece&s;&s;ity of book-keeping to a
trade&s;man, and the very nature of the thing
evidences al&s;o that it mu&s;t be done with the
greate&s;t exactne&s;s. He that does not keep his
books exactly, and &s;o as that he may depend
upon them for charging his debtors, had better
keep no books at all, but, like my &s;hop-keeper,
&s;core and notch every things for as books well
kept makes bu&s;ine&s;s regular, ea&s;y and certain,
&s;o books neglected turn all into confu&s;ion, and
leave the trade&s;man in a wood, which he can
never get out of without damage and lo&s;s; if
ever his dealers know that his books are ill kept
they play upon him, and impo&s;e horrid forge|ries
and fal&s;ities upon him; whatever he omits
they catch at, and leave it out; whatever they
put upon him, he is bound to yield to; &s;o that
in &s;hort, as books well kept are the &s;ecurity of
the trade&s;man's e&s;tate, and the a&s;certaining of
his debts, &s;o books ill kept will a&s;&s;i&s;t every
knavi&s;h cu&s;tomer or chapman to cheat and de|ceive
him.</P>
<P>SOME men keep a due and exact entry or
journal of all they &s;ell, or perhaps of all they
<PB N="330" REF="349">
buy or &s;ell, but are utterly remi&s;s in po&s;ting it
forward to a Ledger; that is to &s;ay, to another
Book, where every parcel is carried to the
debtor's particular account; likewi&s;e they keep
another book, where they enter all the money
they receive, but, as above, never keeping any
account for the man, there it &s;tands in the ca&s;h|book,
and both the&s;e books mu&s;t be ran&s;ack'd
over for the particulars, as well of goods &s;old,
as of the money received, when this cu&s;tomer
comes to have his account made up; and as the
goods are certainly entred when &s;old or &s;ent
away, and the money is certainly entred when
'tis receiv'd, this they think is &s;ufficient, and all
the re&s;t &s;uperfluous.</P>
<P>I doubt not &s;uch trade&s;men often &s;uffer as
much by their &s;lothfulne&s;s and neglect of book-keeping,
as might, e&s;pecially if their bu&s;ine&s;s is
con&s;iderable, pay for a Book-keeper; for what
is &s;uch a man's ca&s;e, when his cu&s;tomer, &s;uppo&s;e
a country-dealer, comes to town, which perhaps
the does once a year, (as is the cu&s;tom of other
trade&s;men) and de&s;ires to have his account made
up? The <HI>London</HI> trade&s;man goes to his books,
and fir&s;t he rumages his Day - book back for
the whole year, and takes out the foot of all
the parcels &s;ent to his chapman, and they make
the debtor &s;ide of the account; then he takes
his ca&s;h-book, if it de&s;erves that name, and
there he rakes out all the &s;ums of money which
the chapman has &s;ent up, or bills which he has
recciv'd, and the&s;e make the creditor &s;ide of
the account; and &s;o the ballance is drawn out;
and this man thinks him&s;elf a mighty good ac|comptant,
<PB N="331" REF="350">
comptant, that he keeps his books exactly; and
&s;o perhaps he does, as far as he keeps them at
all; that is to &s;ay, he never &s;ends a parcel away
to his cu&s;tomer, but he enters it down; and
never receives a bill from him, but he &s;ets it
down when the money is paid; but now take
this man and his chap together, as they are
making up this account; The chapman, a &s;harp
clever trade&s;man, tho' a countryman, has his
pocket-book with him, and in it a copy of his
po&s;ting-book, &s;o the countrymen call <HI>a Ledger,</HI>
where the <HI>London</HI> trade&s;man's accounts are co|pied
out, and when the city trade&s;man has drawn
out his account he takes it to his Inn and ex|amines
it by his little book; and what is the
con&s;equence?</P>
<P>IF the city trade&s;man has omitted any of the
bills which the country trade&s;man has &s;ent him
up, he finds it out, and is &s;ure to put him in
mind of it; Sir, &s;ays he, you had a bill from.
me upon Mr. <HI>A&mdash;G&mdash;,</HI> at &s;uch' a time,
for 30 l. and I have your letter that you receiv'd
the money, but you have omitted it in the ac|count;
&s;o that I am not &s;o much in your debt
by 30 l. as you thought I was.</P>
<P>SAY you &s;o! &s;ays the city trade&s;man, I can|not
think but you mu&s;t be mi&s;taken.</P>
<P>NO, no, <HI>&s;ays the other,</HI> I am &s;ure I can't be
mi&s;taken, for I have it in my book; be&s;ides I
can go to Mr. <HI>A</HI> - - - - - <HI>G</HI> - - - - -, whom the bill
was drawn upon, and there is to be &s;ure your
own endor&s;ement upon it, and a receipt for the
money.</P>
<P><PB N="332" REF="351">
WELL, <HI>&s;ays the citizen,</HI> I keep my books as
exact as any body, I'll look gain, and if it be
there I &s;hall find it, for I am &s;ure if I had it 'tis
in my ca&s;h-book.</P>
<P>PRAY do then, &s;ays the countryman, for I am
&s;ure I &s;ent it you, and I am &s;ure I can produce
the bill if there be occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>AWAY goes the trade&s;man to his books, which
lie pretends he keeps &s;o exact, and examining
them over again, he finds the bill for 30 <HI>l.</HI> en|tred
fairly, but in his running the whole year
over together, as well he might, he had over|look'd
it; whereas if his ca&s;h-book had been
duly po&s;ted every week, as it ought to have
been, this bill had been regularly placed to ac|count.</P>
<P>BUT now ob&s;erve the difference; the bill for
30 l. being omitted was no damage to the coun|try
trade&s;man, becau&s;e he has an account of it
in his book of memorandums, and had it re|gularly
po&s;ted in his books at home, whatever
the other had, and al&s;o was able to bring &s;uffi|cient
proof of the payment; &s;o the <HI>London</HI>
trade&s;man's omi&s;&s;ion was no hurt to him.</P>
<P>BUT the ca&s;e differs exceedingly in the debtor
&s;ide of the account; for here the trade&s;man,
who with all his boa&s;ts of keeping his books
exactly, has yet no Ledger, which being, as I
have &s;aid, duly po&s;ted, &s;hould &s;hew every man's
account at one view, and being done every
week, left it &s;carce po&s;&s;ible to omit any parcel
that was once entred in the day-book or jour|nal;
I &s;ay, the trade&s;man keeping no Ledger,
<PB N="333" REF="352">
he looks over his day-book for the whole year
pa&s;t, to draw up the debtor &s;ide of his cu&s;to|mer's
account, and there being a great many
parcels, truly he overlooks one or two of them;
or &s;uppo&s;e but one of them, and gives the chap|man
the account, in which he Turns up his
debtor &s;ide &s;o much, &s;uppo&s;e 136 <HI>l. 10 s.</HI> the
chapman examining this by his book, as he did
the ca&s;h, finds two parcels, one 7 l. 15 s. and
the other 9 l. 13. omitted; &s;o that by his own
book his debtor &s;ide was 153 <HI>l. 18 s.</HI> but being
a cunning &s;harp trade&s;man, and withal not ex|ceding
hone&s;t, Well, well, &s;ays he to him&s;elf,
if Mr. <HI>G</HI>&mdash;&s;ays 'tis no more than 136 <HI>l.</HI>
10 <HI>s.</HI> what have I to do to contradict him? 'tis
none of my bu&s;ine&s;s to keep his books for him;
'tis time enough for me to reckon for it when,
he charges me. So he goes back to him the
next day, and &s;ettles accounts with him, pays
him the ballancc in good bills which he brought
up with him for that purpo&s;e, takes a receipt in
full of all accounts and demands to &s;uch a day
of the month, and the next day comes and
looks out another parcel of goods, and &s;o be|gins
an account for the next year, like a cur|rent
chapman, and has the credit of an extra|ordinary
cu&s;tomer that pays well, and clears his
accounts every year; which he had not done
had he not &s;een the advantage, and &s;o &s;trained
him&s;elf to pay, that he might get a receipt in
full of all accounts.</P>
<P>IT happens &s;ome years after that this city
trade&s;man dies, and his executors finding his
accounts difficult to make up, there being no
<PB N="334" REF="353">
books to be &s;ound but a Day-book and Ca&s;h|book,
they get &s;ome skilful book-keeper, to
look into, them, who immediately &s;ees; that the
only way to bring the accounts to a head, is to
form a ledger put of the other two, and po&s;t
every body's account into it from the begin|ning
for tho' it were a long way back, there
is no other remedy.</P>
<P>IN doing this they come to this mi&s;take, a|mong
a great many others of the like kind in
other chapmens accounts; upon this-they write
to the chapman, and tell him they find him
debtor to the e&s;tate of the decea&s;ed in &s;uch a
&s;um of money, and de&s;ire him to make pay|ment.</P>
<P>THE country &s;hop-keeper huffs them, tells
them he always made up accounts with Mr. <HI>G&mdash;</HI>
the decea&s;ed, once a year, as he did with all
his other chapmen; and that he took his receipt
in full of all accounts and demands, upon pay|ing
the ballance to him at &s;uch a time; which
receipt he has to &s;hew; and that he owes him
nothing, or but &s;uch a &s;um, being the account
of goods bought &s;ince.</P>
<P>THE Executors finding the mi&s;take, and how
it happened, endeavour to convince him of it;
but 'tis all one, he wants no convincing, for he
knows at bottom how it is; but being a little
of a knave him&s;elf, or if you plea&s;e, <HI>not a little,</HI>
he tells them he cannot enter into the accounts
&s;o far back, Mr. <HI>G&mdash;</HI> always told him he
kept his books very exactly, and he tru&s;ted to
him; and as he has his receipt in full, and it is
&s;o long ago, he can &s;ay nothing to it.</P>
<P><PB N="335" REF="354">
FROM hence they come to quarrel, and the
Executors threaten him with going to law; but
he bids them defiance, and in&s;i&s;ts upon his re|ceipt
in full; and be&s;ides that, 'tis perhaps &s;ix
year? ago, and &s;o he tells them he will plead
the &s;tatute of limitations upon them; and then
adds, that he does not do it to avoid a ju&s;t
debt, but to avoid being impo&s;ed upon, he not
under&s;tanding books &s;o well as Mr. <HI>G&mdash;</HI> pre|tended
to do, and having ballanced accounts &s;o
long ago with him, he &s;tands by the Ballance,
and has nothing to &s;ay to their mi&s;takes, not
he. So that in &s;hort, not finding any remedy,
they are forc'd to &s;it down by the lo&s;s; And
perhaps in the cour&s;e of twenty years trade,
Mr. <HI>G&mdash;</HI> might lo&s;e a great many &s;uch par|cels
in the whole; and had much better have
kept a Ledger; or if he did not know how to
keep a Ledger him&s;elf, had better have hired a
Book-keeper to have come once a week, or
once a month, to have po&s;ted his day-book for
him.</P>
<P>THE like misfortune attends the not ballanc|ing
his ca&s;h, a thing which &s;uch book-keepers
as Mr. <HI>G&mdash;</HI> do not think worth their trou|ble;
nor do they under&s;tand the benefit of it;
the particulars indeed of this article are tedious,
and would be too long for a letter, but certain|ly
they that know any thing of the u&s;e of
keeping-an exact ca&s;h-book, know that without
it, a trade&s;man can never be thoroughly &s;atisfied
either of his own not committing mi&s;takes, or
of any people cheating him, I mean &s;ervants,
or &s;ons, or whoever is the fir&s;t about him.</P>
<P><PB N="336" REF="355">
WHAT I call ballancing his ca&s;h-book, is,
fir&s;t, the ca&s;ting up, daily, or weekly, or month|ly
his receipts and payments, and then &s;eeing
what money is left in hand, or, as the u&s;ual ex|pre&s;&s;ion
of the trade&s;man is, what money is in
ca&s;h; &s;econdly, the, examining his money, tel|ling
it over, and &s;eeing how much he has in
his che&s;t or bags and then &s;eeing if it agrees
with the ballance of his book, that what <HI>is,</HI>
and: what <HI>&s;hould be,</HI> corre&s;pond.</P>
<P>AND here let me give Trade&s;men a caution
or two.</P>
<P>1. NEVER &s;it down &s;atisfied with an error in
the ca&s;h; that; is to &s;ay, with a difference be|tween
the money really in the ca&s;h, and the
ballance in the book; for if they do not agree,
there mu&s;t be a mi&s;take &s;omewhere, and while
there is a mi&s;take in the ca&s;h;, the trade&s;man
cannot, at lea&s;t he ought not, to be ea&s;y; He
that can be ea&s;y with a mi&s;take in his ca&s;h,
may be ea&s;y with a gang of Thieves in his hou&s;e;
for if his money does not come right, he mu&s;t
have paid &s;omething that is not &s;et down, and
that is to be &s;uppo&s;ed as bad as if it were lo&s;t;
or he mu&s;t have &s;omebody about him that can
find the way to his money be&s;ides him&s;elf; that
is to &s;ay, &s;omebody that &s;hould not come to it;
and if &s;o, what is the difference between that
and having a gang of thieves about him? for
every one that takes money out of his ca&s;h with|out
his leave, and without letting him know it,
is &s;o far a thief to him: and he can never pre|tend
to ballance his ca&s;h, or indeed know any
thing of his affairs, that does not know which
his money goes.</P>
<P><PB N="337" REF="356">
2. A trade&s;man endeavouring to ballance his
ca&s;h, &s;hould no more be &s;atisfied if he finds a
mi&s;take in his ca&s;h one way, than another; that
is to &s;ay, if he finds more in ca&s;h than by the
ballance of his ca&s;h-book ought to be there, than
if he finds le&s;s, or wanting in ca&s;h: I know ma|ny,
who when they find it thus, &s;it down &s;ati&s;|fied,
and &s;ay, Well, there is an error, and I
don't know where it lies; but come, 'tis an
error on the right hand, I have more ca&s;h in
hand thari I &s;hould have, that's all, &s;o I am well
enough, let it go, I &s;hall find it &s;ome time or
other. But the trade&s;man ought to con&s;ider,
that he is quite in the dark, and as he, does not
really know where it lies, &s;o for ought he knows
the error may really be to his lo&s;s very con&s;I|derably;
and the ca&s;e, is very plain that it is as
dangerous to be over, as it would be to be un|der;
he &s;hould therefore never give it over till
he has found it out, and brought it to rights
<HI>For example:</HI></P>
<P>IF there appears to be more money in the
ca&s;h than there is by the ballance in the ca&s;h|book,
this mu&s;t follow, <HI>viz.</HI> That &s;ome parcel
of money mu&s;t have been receiv'd, which is not
entred in the book; now till the trade&s;man
knows what &s;um of money this is, that is thus
not entred, how can he tell but the mi&s;take
may be quite the other way, and the ca&s;h be
really wrong to his lo&s;s? <HI>Thus,</HI></P>
<P>MY ca&s;h-book being ca&s;t up for the la&s;t month,
I find by the foot of the leaf there is ca&s;h re|maining
in hand to ballance 176<HI>l, 10 s. 6 d.</HI>

To &s;ee if all things are right, I go and tell
my money over, and there, to my &s;urpri&s;e, I
find 194<HI>l.</HI> 10<HI>s. 6 d.</HI> in ca&s;h; &s;o that I have 18 <HI>l.</HI>
there more than I &s;hould have: now, far from
being plea&s;ed that I have more money by me
than I &s;hould have, my enquiry is plain, How
comes this to pa&s;s?</P>
<P>PERHAPS I puzzle my head a great while a|bout
it, but not being able to find it out, I &s;it
down ea&s;y and &s;atisfied, and &s;ay, <HI>Well,</HI> I don't
much concern my &s;elf about it, 'tis better to be
&s;o than 18 <HI>l.</HI> mi&s;&s;ing; I cannot tell where it
lies, but let it lie where it will; here's the mo|ney
to make up the mi&s;take when it appears.</P>
<P>BUT how fooli&s;h is this? how ill-grounded
the &s;atisfaction? and how weak am I to argue
thus, and plea&s;e my &s;elf with the delu&s;ion?
for &s;ome months after it appears, perhaps, that
whereas there was 38 <HI>l.</HI> entred, receiv'd of Mr.
<HI>B</HI>&mdash;<HI>K</HI>&mdash;the figure 3 was mi&s;taken,
and &s;et down for a figure of 5, for the &s;um re|ceiv'd
was 58 <HI>l.</HI> &s;o that in&s;tead of having 18 <HI>l.</HI>
more in ca&s;h than there ought to be, I have
40 <HI>s.</HI> wanting in my ca&s;h; which my &s;on or my
apprentice &s;tole from me when they put in the
money, and made the mi&s;take of the figures to
puzzle the book, that it might be &s;ome time
before it &s;hould be di&s;covered.</P>
<P>UPON the whole, take it as a rule, the
trade&s;man ought to be as un&s;atisfied when he
finds a mi&s;take to his gain in his ca&s;h, as when
he finds it to his lo&s;s; and it is every whit as
dangerous, nay, it is the more &s;u&s;picious, be|cau&s;e
it &s;eems to be laid as a bait for him to
<PB N="339" REF="360">
&s;top his mouth, and to prevent farther enqui|ries;
and 'tis on that account that I leave this
caution upon record, that the trade&s;man may be
duly alarm'd.</P>
<P>THE keeping a ca&s;h-book is one of the nice&s;t
parts of a trade&s;man's bu&s;ine&s;s, becau&s;e there is
always the bag and the book to be brought to|gether,
and if they do not exactly &s;peak the
&s;ame language, even to a farthing, there mu&s;t
be &s;ome omi&s;&s;ion; and how big or how little
that omi&s;&s;ion may be, who knows? or how
&s;hall it be known, but by ca&s;ting and re-ca&s;ting
up, telling, and telling over and over again the
money?</P>
<P>IF there is but twenty &s;hillings over in the
money, the que&s;tion is, <HI>How came it there?</HI> It
mu&s;t be receiv'd &s;ome where, and of &s;ome bo|dy,
more than is entred; and how can the ca&s;h|keeper,
<HI>be he ma&s;ter or &s;ervant,</HI> know but more
was received with it, which is not, and &s;hould
have been, entred, and &s;o the lo&s;s may be, the
other way? It is true, in telling money there
may have been a mi&s;take, and he that received
a &s;um of money may have received twenty &s;hil|lings
too much, or five pounds too much; and
&s;uch a mi&s;take I have known to be made in the
paying and receiving of money; and a man's
ca&s;h has been more perplexed, and his mind
more di&s;tracted about it, than the five pound has
been worth, becau&s;e he could not find it out,
till &s;ome accident has di&s;covered it: and the
rea&s;on is, becau&s;e not knowing which, way it
could come there, he could not know but &s;ome
<PB N="340" REF="361">
omi&s;&s;ion might be made to his lo&s;s another way,
as in the cea&s;e above-mentioned.</P>
<P>I knew indeed a <HI>Strong-water man,</HI> who drove
a very con&s;iderable trade, but being an illiterate
trade&s;man, never ballanced his ca&s;h-book for
many years, nor &s;carce po&s;ted his other books,
and indeed hardly under&s;tood how to do it; but
knowing his trade was exceeding profitable, and
keeping his money all him&s;elf, he was ea&s;ie, and
grew rich apace, in &s;pight of the mo&s;t unju&s;ti|&s;ible,
and indeed the mo&s;t intolerable negli|gence;
but le&s;t this &s;hould be pleaded as an
exception to my general rule, and to invalidate
the argument, give me leave to add, that tho'
this man grew rich in &s;pight of indolence, and
a neglect of his book, yet when he died two
things appear'd, which no trade&s;men in his wits
would de&s;ire &s;hould be &s;aid of him.</P>
<P>I. THE &s;ervants falling out, and malice|ou&s;ly
accusing one another, had, as it appear|ed
by the affidavits of &s;everal of them, wrong|ed
him of &s;everal con&s;iderable &s;ums of mo|ney,
which they receiv'd, and never brought
into the books; and others, of &s;ums which
they brought into the books, but never brought
into the ca&s;h; and others, of &s;ums which
they took ready money in the &s;hop, and ne|ver
&s;et down, either the goods in the day-book,
or the money into the ca&s;h-book; and
it was thought, tho' he was &s;o rich, as not
to feel it, that is, not to his hurt, yet that
he lo&s;t three or four hundred pounds a year
<PB N="341" REF="362">
in that manner, for the two or three la&s;t years
of his life; but his widow and &s;on, who
came after him, having the di&s;covery made
to them, took better mea&s;ures afterwards.</P>
<P>II. HE never did, or could know what he
was worth; for the accounts in his books
were never made up, nor when he came to
die, could his executors make up any man's
account, &s;o as to be able to prove the particu|lars,
and make a ju&s;t demand of their debt;
but found a prodigious number of &s;mall &s;ums
of money paid by the debtors, as by receipts
in their books, and on their files, &s;ome by
him&s;elf, and &s;ome by his man, which were
never brought to account, or brought into
ca&s;h; and his man's an&s;wer being &s;till, that he
gave all to the ma&s;ter, they could not tell how
to charge him by the ma&s;ter's account, be|cau&s;e
&s;everal &s;ums, which the ma&s;ter him&s;elf
receiv'd, were omitted being entred in the
&s;ame manner; &s;o that all was confu&s;ion and
neglect; and tho' the man died rich, it was
in &s;pight of that management that would have
made any but him&s;elf have died poor.</P>
<P>EXACT book-keeping is to me the effect of a
man, who&s;e heart is in his bu&s;ine&s;s, and who
intends to Thrive; he that cares not whether
his books are kept well, or no, is in my opi|nion
one that does not much care whether he
thrives, or no; or el&s;e, being in de&s;perate cir|cum&s;tances,
knows it, and that he cannot, or
does not thrive, and &s;o matters not which way
it goes.</P>
<P><PB N="342" REF="363">

and &s;ecret, and is &s;eldom known to any body

how &s;hould he but break? why he kept
no books; you never &s;ee books kept in &s;uch a
&s;candalous manner in your life; why, he has
not po&s;ted his Ca&s;h-book, for I know not how
many months; nor po&s;ted his Day-book and Jour|nal
at all, except here and there, an account that
he perhaps wanted to know the ballance of;
and as for ballancing his ca&s;h, I don't &s;ee any
thing of that done, I know not how long;
why, this fellow could never tell how he went
on, or how things &s;tood with him, I wonder he
did nor break a long time ago.</P>
<P>Now the man's ca&s;e was this; he knew how
to keep his books well enough, perhaps, and
could write well enough; and if you look into
his five or &s;ix fir&s;t years of trade, you find all his
accounts well kept, the Journal duly po&s;ted,
the ca&s;h monthly ballanced; but the poor man
found after that, that things went wrong, that
he went backward, and that all went down hill,
and he hated to look into his books: As a pro|fligate
never looks into his con&s;cience, becau&s;e
he can &s;ee nothing there, but what terrifies and
affrights him, makes him unea&s;y and melancho|ly;
&s;o a &s;inking trade&s;man cares nor to look in|to
his books, becau&s;e the pro&s;pect there is dark
and melancholy; what &s;ignify the accounts to
me; &s;ays he, I can &s;ee nothing in the books
<PB N="343" REF="364">
but debts, that I cannot pay and debtors, that
will never pay me; I can &s;ee nothing there but
how I have tru&s;ted my e&s;tate away like a fool,
and how I am to be ruin'd for my ea&s;ine&s;s, and
being a Sot; and this makes him throw them
away, and hardly Po&s;t things enough to make
up when folks call to pay; or if he does Po&s;t
&s;uch accounts as he has money to receive from,
that's all, and the re&s;t lie at random, 'till, as I
&s;ay, the A&s;&s;ignees come to reproach him with
his negligence.</P>
<P>WHEREAS in truth, the man under&s;tood his
books well enough, but had no heart to look
in them, no courage to ballance them, becau&s;e
of the afflicting pro&s;pect of them.</P>
<P>BUT let me here advi&s;e trade&s;men to keep
a perfect acquaintance with their books, though
things arc bad and di&s;couraging; it keeps them
in full knowledge of what they are doing, and
how they really &s;tand; and it brings them &s;ome|times
to the ju&s;t reflections on their. circum&s;tan|ces
which they ought to make; &s;o to &s;top in
time, as I hinted before, and not let things run
too far before they arc &s;urpri&s;ed, and torn to
pieces by violence.</P>
<P>AND at the wor&s;t, even a declining trade&s;|man
&s;hould not let his books be neglected; if
his creditors find them punctually kept to the
la&s;t, it will be a credit to him, and they would
&s;ee he was a man fit for bu&s;ine&s;s; and I have
known when that very thing has recommended
a trade&s;man &s;o much to his creditors, that after
the ruin of his fortunes, &s;ome or other of them
have taken him into bu&s;ine&s;s, as into partner|&s;hips,
<PB N="344" REF="365">
or into employment, only becau&s;e they
knew him to be qualify'd for bu&s;ine&s;s, and for
keeping books in particular.</P>
<P>BUT if we &s;hould admioni&s;h the trade&s;man to
an exact and regular care of his books, even in
his declining fortunes; much more &s;hould it be
his care in his beginning, and before any di&s;a&s;ter
has befallen him: I doubt not, that many a
trade&s;man has mi&s;carried by the mi&s;takes and
neglect of his book; for the lo&s;&s;es that men
&s;uffer on that account are not ea&s;ily &s;et down;
but I recommend it to a trade&s;man to take ex|act
care of his books, as I would to every man
to take care of His diet and temperate living,
in order to their health; for tho' according to
&s;ome we cannot by all our care and caution
lengthen out life, but that every one mu&s;t and
&s;hall live their appointed time; yet by temper|ance
and regular conduct we may make that life
more comfortable, more agreeable, and plea&s;ant,
by its being more healthy and hearty; &s;o tho'
the exacte&s;t book-keeping cannot be &s;aid to make
a trade&s;man Thrive, or that he &s;hall &s;tand the
longer in his bu&s;ine&s;s, becau&s;e his profit and lo&s;s
does not depend upon his books, or the good|ne&s;s
of his debts depend upon the debtors ac|counts
being well po&s;ted; yet this mu&s;t be &s;aid,
that the well keeping of his books may be the
occa&s;ion of his trade being carried on with the
more ea&s;e and plea&s;ure, and the more &s;atisfacti|on,
by having numberle&s;s quarrels, and conten|tions,
and law-&s;uits, which are the plagues of
a trade&s;man's life, prevented and avoided; which
on the contrary often torment a trade&s;man, and
<PB N="345" REF="366">
make his whole bu&s;ine&s;s be unea&s;y to hurt for
want of being able to make a regular proof of
things by his books.</P>
<P>A trade&s;man without his books, in ca&s;e of a
law-&s;uit for a debt, is like a married, woman with|out
her certificate: How many times has a wo|man
been ca&s;t, and her cau&s;e not only lo&s;t, but
her reputation, and character expos'd, for want
of being able to prove her marriage, tho' &s;he
has been really and hone&s;tly married, and has
merited a good character all her days? and &s;o
in trade, many a debt has been lo&s;t, many an
account been perplexed by the debtor, many a
&s;um of money been recovered, and actually
paid over again, e&s;pecially after the trade&s;man
has been dead, for want of his keeping his books
carefully, and exactly when he was alive; by
which negligence, if he has not been ruin'd
when he was living, his widow and children
have been ruin'd after his decea&s;e; tho' he, had
ju&s;tice been, done, he had left them in good cir|cum&s;tances,
and with &s;ufficient to &s;upport them.</P>
<P>AND this brings me to another principal rea|&s;on,
why a trade&s;man &s;hould not only keep
books, but be very regular and exact in keep|ing
them in order; that is to &s;ay, duly po&s;ted,
and all his affairs exactly and duly enter'd in his
books; and this is, that if he &s;hould be &s;urpri|&s;ed
by &s;udden or unexpected, &s;ickne&s;s, or death,
as many are, and as all may be, his accounts
may not be left intricate and un&s;ettled, and his
affairs thereby be perplexed.</P>
<P>NEXT to being prepar'd for death, with re|&s;pect
to Heaven and his &s;oul, a trade&s;man &s;hould
<PB N="346" REF="367">
be always in a &s;tate of preparation for death, with
re&s;pect to his books; it is in vain that he
calls for a Scrivener or Lawyer, and makes a
will, when he finds a &s;udden &s;ummons &s;ent
him for the grave, and calls his friends about
him to divide, and &s;ettle his e&s;tate; if his
bu&s;ine&s;s is in confu&s;ion below &s;tairs, his books
out of order, and his accounts un&s;ettled, to
what purpo&s;e does he give his e&s;tate among his
relations, when no body knows where to find it?</P>
<P>AS then the mini&s;ter exhorts us to take care
of our &s;ouls, and make our peace with Heaven,
while we are in a &s;tate of health, and while
life has no threatening enemies about it, no di&s;|ea&s;s,
no feavers $span$ let me &s;econd
that advice to the trade&s;man always to keep his
books in &s;uch a po&s;ture, that it he &s;hould be
&s;natch'd away by death, his di&s;tre&s;&s;ed widow and
fatherle&s;s family, may know what is left for them,
and may know where to look for it: He may
depend upon it, that what he owes to any one
they will come fa&s;t enough for, and his widow
and executrix will be pull'd to pieces for it, if
&s;he cannot and does not &s;peedily pay it; why
then &s;hould he not put her in a condition to
have ju&s;tice done her and her children, and to
know how and of whom to &s;eek for his ju&s;t
debts, that &s;he may be able to pay others, and
&s;ecure the remainder for her&s;elf and her chil|dren?
I mu&s;t confe&s;s, a trade&s;man not to leave
his books in order when he dies, argues him
to be either,</P>
<Q><LIST>
<ITEM>1. A very bad Chri&s;tian, who had few or no
thoughts of death upon him, or that con|&s;ider'd
<PB N="347" REF="368">
nothing of its frequent coming unex|pected,
and &s;udden without warning; or,</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. A very unnatural relation, without the af|fections
of a father, or a husband, or even
of a friend; that &s;hould rather leave what
he had to be &s;wallow'd up by &s;trangers,
than leave his family and friends in a con|dition
to find, and to recover it.</ITEM>
</LIST></Q>
<P>AGAIN, 'tis the &s;ame ca&s;e as in matters reli|gious,
with re&s;pect to the doing this in time,
and while health and &s;trength remain: For as
we &s;ay very well, and with great rea&s;on, that
the work of eternity &s;hould not be left to the
la&s;t: moments; that a death-bed is no place, and
a &s;ick langui&s;hing body no condition, and the
la&s;t breath no time for repentance; &s;o I may add,
neither are the&s;e the place, the condition, or
the time to make up our accounts; there's no
po&s;ting the books on a death-bed, or ballancing
the Ca&s;h-book in a high feaver: Can the trade&s;|man
tell you where his effects lie, and to whom
he has lent or tru&s;ted &s;ums of money, or large
quantities of goods, when he is delirious and
light-headed? All the&s;e things mu&s;t be done in
time, and the tradesman &s;hould take care, that
his books &s;hould always do this for him, and
then he has nothing to do but make his will,
and di&s;po&s;e of what he has; and for the re&s;t
he refers them to his books, to know where e|very
thing is to be had.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXI.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Trade&s;man letting his. Wife be ac|quainted
with his Bu&s;ine&s;s.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_IT mu&s;t be acknowledg'd, that as this
letter &s;eems to be written in favour of
the women, it al&s;o &s;eems to be an of|ficious,
thankle&s;s benefaction to the wives; for
that, as the trade&s;mens Ladies now manage,
they are above the favour, and put no value up|on
it; on the contrary, the women, generally
&s;peaking, trouble not their heads about it, &s;corn
to be &s;een in the compting-hou&s;e, much le&s;s
behind the counter; de&s;pi&s;e the knowledge of
their husband's bu&s;ine&s;s, and act as if they were
a&s;ham'd of being trade&s;mens wives, and never
intended to be trade&s;mens widows.</P>
<P>IF this cho&s;en ignorance of theirs comes &s;ome
time or other to be their lo&s;s, and they find the
di&s;advantage of it too late, they may read their
fault in their puni&s;hment, and wi&s;h too late
they had acted the humbler part, and not thought
it below them to inform them&s;elves of what it
is &s;o much their intere&s;t to know: This pride
is indeed the great misfortune of trade&s;mens
wives; for as they liv'd as if they were above
being own'd for the trade&s;man's wife, &s;o when
<PB N="349" REF="370">
he dies, they live to be the &s;hame of the trade&s;|man's
widow: They knew nothing how he got
his e&s;tate when, he was alive, and they know
nothing where to find it when he is dead. This
drives them into the hands of Lawyers, Attor|neys,
and Sollicitors, to get in their effects;
who, when they have got it, often run away
with it, and leave the poor widow in a more
di&s;con&s;olate and perplex'd condition, than &s;he
was in before.</P>
<P>IT is true indeed, that this is the womens
fault in one re&s;pect, and too often, it is &s;o in
many, &s;ince the common &s;pirit is, <HI>as I ob&s;erv'd,</HI>
&s;o much above the trade&s;man's condition; but
&s;ince it is not &s;o with every body, let me &s;tate
the ca&s;e a little for the u&s;e of tho&s;e who &s;till
have their &s;en&s;es about them; and who&s;e pride
is not got &s;o much above their rea&s;on, as to let
them choo&s;e to be trade&s;mens beggars, rather
than trade&s;mens widows.</P>
<P>WHEN the Trade&s;man dies, it is to be expect|ed,
that what e&s;tate or effects he leaves is, ge|nerally
&s;peaking, di&s;pers'd about in many hands;
his widow, if &s;he is left executrix, has the trou|ble
of getting things together as well as &s;he
can; if &s;he is not left executrix, &s;he has not the
trouble indeed, but then it is look'd upon that
&s;he is di&s;honour'd in not having the tru&s;t; when
&s;he comes to look into her affairs, &s;he is more
or le&s;s perplex'd and embara&s;s'd, as &s;he <HI>has not</HI>
or <HI>has</HI> acquainted her&s;elf, or been made acquaint|ed
with her husband's affairs in his life-time.</P>
<P>IF &s;he has been one of tho&s;e gay delicate La|dies,
that valuing her&s;elf upon her being a gen|tlewoman,
<PB N="350" REF="371">
and that thought it a &s;tep below her|&s;elf,
when &s;he married this mechanick thing cal|led
a trade&s;man, and con&s;equently &s;corn'd to
come near his &s;hop, or warehou&s;e, and by con|&s;equence
acquainting her&s;elf with any of his af|fairs,
or &s;o much as where his effects lay, which
are to be her fortune for the future: <HI>I &s;ay,</HI> if
this has been her ca&s;e, her folly calls for pity
now, as her pride did for contempt before; for
as &s;he was fooli&s;h in the fir&s;t, &s;he may be mi|&s;erable
in the la&s;t part of it; for now &s;he falls
into a &s;ea of trouble, &s;he has the &s;atisfaction of
knowing that her husband has died, as the trade&s;|men
call it, well to pa&s;s, and that &s;he is left
well enough; but &s;he has at the &s;ame time the
mortification of knowing nothing how to get it
in, or in what hands it lies: The only relief
&s;he has is her husband's books, and &s;he is happy
in that, but ju&s;t in proportion to the care he
took in keeping them; even when &s;he finds the
names of debtors, &s;he knows not who they are,
or where they dwell, who are good, and who
are bad; the only remedy &s;he has here is, if
her husband had e'er a &s;ervant, or apprentice,
who was &s;o near out of his time as to be ac|quainted
with the cu&s;tomers, and with the books,
then &s;he is forced to be beholden to him to &s;et|tle
the accounts for her, and endeavour to get
in the debts; in return for which &s;he is forced
to give him his time and freedom, and let him
into the trade, make him ma&s;ter of all the bu|&s;ine&s;s
in the world, and it may be, at la&s;t, with
all her pride, lets the boy creep to bed to her;
and when her friends upbraid her with it, that
<PB N="351" REF="372">
&s;he &s;hould marry her 'prentice boy, when it may
be &s;he was old enough to be his mother: <HI>Her
an&s;wer is,</HI> &startq;Why, what could I do? I &s;ee I
mu&s;t have been ruin'd el&s;e; I had nothing but
what lay abroad in debts, &s;catter'd about the
world, and no body but he knew how to get
them in: <HI>What could I do?</HI> If I had not done
it, I mu&s;t have been a beggar.&endq; And &s;o it
may be <HI>&s;he is</HI> at la&s;t too, if the boy of a hu&s;|band
proves a brute to her, as many do, and as
in &s;uch unequal matches indeed mo&s;t &s;uch peo|ple
do.</P>
<P>THUS that pride, which once &s;et her above
a kind, diligent, tender husband, and made her
&s;corn to &s;toop to acquaint her &s;elf with his af|fairs,
by which, had &s;he done it, &s;he had been
tolerably qualified to get in her debts, di&s;po&s;e
of her &s;hop-goods, and bring her e&s;tate together;
the &s;ame pride &s;inks her into the nece&s;&s;ity of
cringing to a &s;coundrel, and taking her &s;ervant
to be her ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>THIS I mention for the caution of tho&s;e La|dies
who &s;toop to marry men of bu&s;ine&s;s, and
yet de&s;pi&s;e the bu&s;ine&s;s they are maintain'd by;
that marry the trade&s;man, but &s;corn the trade:
If Madam thinks fit to &s;toop to the man, &s;he
ought never to think her &s;elf above owning
his employment; and as &s;he may upon occa&s;I|on
of his death be left to value her &s;elf upon
it, and to have at lea&s;t her fortune and her chil|drens
to gather up out of it, &s;he ought not to
profe&s;s her &s;elf &s;o unacquainted with it as not
to be able to look into it when nece&s;&s;ity obliges
her.</P>
<P><PB N="352" REF="373">
IT is a terrible di&s;a&s;ter to any woman to be &s;o
far above her own circumstances, that &s;he &s;hould
not qualify her &s;elf to make the be&s;t of things
that are left her, or to pre&s;erve her &s;elf from
being cheated, and being impo&s;ed upon. In
former times trade&s;mens widows valued them|&s;elves
upon the &s;hop and trade, or the ware|hou&s;e
and trade that was left them; and at lea&s;t,
if they did not carry on the trade in their own
names, they would keep it up till they put it
off to advantage; and often I have known a
Widow get from 300 to 500 <HI>l.</HI> for the good-will,
as 'tis call'd, of the &s;hop and trade, if &s;he did not
think fit to carry on the trade; if &s;he did, the
ca&s;e turned the other way, namely, that if the
Widow did not put off the &s;hop, the &s;hop
would put off the Widow: And I may venture
to &s;ay, that where there is one Widow that
keeps on the trade now, after a husband's de|cea&s;e,
there were ten, if not twenty, that did
it then.</P>
<P>BUT now the Ladies are above it, and di&s;dain
it &s;o much, that they chu&s;e rather to go with|out
the pro&s;pect of a &s;econd marriage, in vir|tue
of the trade, than to &s;toop to the mechanick
low &s;tep of carrying on a trade; and they have
their reward, for they do go without it; and
whereas they might in former times match in|finitely
to their advantage by that method, now
they throw them&s;elves away, and the trade
too.</P>
<P>BUT this is not the ca&s;e which I particularly
aim at in this letter; if the women will act
weakly and foolishly, and throw away the ad|vantages
<PB N="353" REF="374">
that he puts into their hands, be that
to them, and it is their bu&s;ine&s;s to take care of
that; but I would have them have the opportu|nity
put into their hands, and that they may
make the be&s;t of it if they plea&s;e, if they will
not the fault is their own: But to this end, I
&s;ay, I would have every trade&s;man make his
wife &s;o much acquainted with his trade, and
&s;o much mi&s;tre&s;s of the managing part of it,
that &s;he might be able to carry it on if &s;he plea&s;|ed,
in ca&s;e of his death; if &s;he does not plea&s;e,
that is another ca&s;e; or if &s;he will not acquaint
her &s;elf with, it, that al&s;o is another ca&s;e, and
&s;he mu&s;t let it alone: But he &s;hould put it into
her power, or give her the offer of it.</P>
<P>FIRST, he &s;hould do it for her own &s;ake,
namely, as before, that &s;he may make her ad|vantage
of it, either for di&s;po&s;ing her &s;elf and
the &s;hop together, <HI>as is &s;aid above,</HI> or for the
more readily di&s;po&s;ing the goods, and getting
in the debts, without di&s;honouring her &s;elf, as
I have ob&s;erved, and marrying her 'prentice boy,
in order to take care of the effects; that is to
&s;ay, <HI>ruining</HI> her &s;elf to prevent her being <HI>ruin'd.</HI></P>
<P>SECONDLY, He &s;hould do it for his childrens
&s;ake, if he has any, that if the wife have any
knowledge of the bu&s;ine&s;s, and has a &s;on to
breed up to it, tho' he be not yet of age to
take it up, &s;he may keep the trade for him, and
introduce him into it, that &s;o he may take the
trouble off of her hands, and &s;he may have the
&s;atisfaction of pre&s;erving the father's trade for
the benefit of his &s;on, tho' left too young to
enter upon it at fir&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="354" REF="375">
THUS I have known many a widow that would
have thought it otherwise below her, has en|gaged
her &s;elf in her husband's bu&s;ine&s;s, and
carried it on, purely to bring her elde&s;t &s;on up
to it, and has pre&s;erved it for him, and which
has been an e&s;tate to him; whereas otherwi&s;e it
mu&s;t have been lo&s;t, and he would have had
the world to &s;eek for a new bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>THIS is a thing which every hone&s;t affectio|nate
mother would, or at lea&s;t &s;hould, be &s;o wil|ling
to do for a &s;on, that &s;he, I think, who
would not, ought not to marry a trade&s;man at
all; but if &s;he would think her &s;elf above &s;o
important a tru&s;t for her own children, &s;he
&s;hould likewi&s;e think her &s;elf above having chil|dren
by a trade&s;man, and marry &s;omebody
who&s;e children &s;he would act the mother for.</P>
<P>BUT every widow is not &s;o unnatural, and I
am willing; to &s;uppo&s;e the trade&s;man I am writ|ing
to, &s;hall be better married, and therefore I
give over &s;peaking to the woman's &s;ide, and
I will &s;uppo&s;e the trade&s;man's wife not to be
above her quality, and willing to be made ac|quainted
with her husband's affairs; as well to
be helpful to him, if &s;he can, as to be in a con|dition
to be helpful to her &s;elf and her family,
if &s;he comes to have occa&s;ion: Bat then the
difficulty often lies on the ether &s;ide the que&s;|tion,
and the trade&s;man cares not to lay open
his bu&s;ine&s;s to, or acquaint his wife with it;
and many circum&s;tances of the trade&s;man draw
him into this &s;nare; for I mu&s;t call it a &s;nare
both to him and to her,</P>
<P><PB N="355" REF="376">
I. THE trade&s;man is fooli&s;hly vain, of mak|ing
his wife a gentlewoman, and for&s;ooth he
will have her &s;it above in the parlour, and
receive vi&s;its, and drink Tea, and entertain her
neighbours, or take a coach and go abroad;
But as to the bu&s;ine&s;s, &s;he &s;hall not &s;toop to
touch it, he has Apprentices and journeymen,
and there is no need of it.</P>
<P>II. SOME trades indeed arc not proper for
the women to meddle in, or cu&s;tom has made
it &s;o, that it would be ridiculous for the wo|men
to appear in their &s;hops; that is, &s;uch as
linen and woollen drapers, mercers, book-&s;ellers,
gold&s;miths, and all &s;orts of dealers by
commi&s;&s;ion, and the like; cu&s;tom, I &s;ay, has made
the&s;e trades &s;o effectually &s;hut out the women,
that what with cu&s;tom, and the women's ge|nerally
thinking it below them, we never, or
rarely, &s;ee any women in tho&s;e &s;hops or ware|hou&s;es.</P>
<P>III. OR if the trade is proper, and the wife
willing, the husband declines it, and &s;huts
her out; and this is the thing I complain of
as an inju&s;tice upon the woman: But our
trade&s;men, for&s;ooth, think it an undervaluing
to them and to their bu&s;ine&s;s, to have their
wives &s;een in their &s;hops; that is to &s;ay, that
becau&s;e other trades do not admit them, there|fore
they will not have their trades or &s;hops
thought le&s;s ma&s;culine or le&s;s con&s;iderable
than others, and they will not have their
wives be &s;een in their &s;hops.</P>
<P><PB N="356" REF="377">
IV. BUT there are two &s;orts of husbands
more who decline acquainting their wives
with, their bu&s;ine&s;s; and tho&s;e are, (1.) Tho&s;e
who are unkind, haughty and imperious, who
will not tru&s;t their wives, becau&s;e they will not
make them u&s;eful, that they may not value
them&s;elves upon it, and make them&s;elves as it
were equal to their husbands: A weak, fooli&s;h
and ab&s;urd &s;ugge&s;tion! as if the wife were at all
exalted by it; which indeed is ju&s;t the con|trary,
for the woman is rather humbled and
made a &s;ervant by it: Or, (2.) The other
&s;ort are tho&s;e who are afraid their wives &s;hould
be let into the knowledge of their bu&s;ine&s;s,
left they &s;hould come into the grand &s;ecret
of all, namely, to know that they are bank|rupt,
and undone, and worth nothing.</P>
<P>ALL the&s;e con&s;iderations are fooli&s;h or frau|dulent,
and in every one of them the husband
is in the wrong; nay, they all argue very &s;trong|ly
for the wife's being, in a due degree, let in|to
the knowledge of their bu&s;ine&s;s; but the la&s;t
indeed e&s;pecially, that &s;he may be put into a
po&s;ture to &s;ave him from ruin, if it be po&s;&s;ible,
or to carry on &s;ome bu&s;ine&s;s without him, if he
is forc'd to fail, and fly; as many have been,
when the creditors have encourag'd the wife to
carry on a trade for the &s;upport of her family
and children, when he perhaps may never &s;hew
his head again.</P>
<P>BUT let the man's ca&s;e be what it will, I think
he can never call it a hard &s;hift, to let his wife into
an acquaintance with his bu&s;ine&s;s, if &s;he de&s;ires
<PB N="357" REF="378">
it, and is fit for it; and e&s;pecially in ca&s;e of
mortality, that &s;he may not be left helple&s;s and
friendless with her children, when, her husband
is gone, and when perhaps her circum&s;tances
may require it.</P>
<P>I am not for a man letting his wife at the
head of his bu&s;ine&s;s, and placing him&s;elf under
her, like a journeyman, like a certain China|&s;eller,
not far from the <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> hou&s;e, who
if any cu&s;tomers came into the &s;hop that made
a mean &s;orry figure, would leave them to her
husband to manage and attend them; but if
they look'd like Quality, and people of fa&s;hion,
would, come up to her husband, when he was
&s;hewing them his goods putting him by with
a <HI>Hold your tongue,</HI> Tom, <HI>and let me talk;</HI>
I &s;ay, 'tis not this kind, or part that I would
have the trade&s;man's wife let into, but &s;uch,
and &s;o much of the trade only as may be pro|per
for her, not ridiculous in the eye of the
worlds and may make her a&s;&s;i&s;ting and helpful,
nor governing to him, and <HI>which is the main
thing I aim at,</HI> &s;uch as &s;hould qualify her to
keep up the bu&s;ine&s;s for her &s;elf and children,
if her husband &s;hould be taken away, and &s;he
be left de&s;titute in the world, as many are.</P>
<P>THUS much, I think, 'tis hard a wife &s;hould
not know, and no hone&s;t trade&s;man ought to
refu&s;e it; and above all, 'tis great pity the wives
of trade&s;men, who &s;o often are reduced to great
inconveniencies for want of it, &s;hould &s;o far
with&s;tand their own felicity, as to refu&s;e to be
thus made acquainted with their bu&s;ine&s;s, by
which weak and fooli&s;h pride they expo&s;e them|&s;elves,
<PB N="358" REF="379">
as I have ob&s;erved, to the misfortune of
throwing the bu&s;ine&s;s away, when they may
come to want it; and when the keeping it up
might be the re&s;toring of their family, and
providing for their children.</P>
<P>FOR, not to compliment trade&s;men too much,
their wives are not all Ladies, nor are their
children all born to be Gentlemen; trade, on
the contrary, is &s;ubject to contingencies; &s;ome
begin poor, and end rich; others, and tho&s;e
very many, begin rich, and end poor: and there
are innumerable circum&s;tances which may attend
a trade&s;man's family, which may make it ab&s;o|lutely
nece&s;&s;ary to pre&s;erve the trade for his chil|dren,
if po&s;&s;ible; the doing which may keep
them from mi&s;ery, and rai&s;e them all in the
world; and the want of it, on the other hand,
&s;inks and &s;uppre&s;&s;es them. <HI>For example:</HI></P>
<P>A trade&s;man has begun the world about &s;ix
or &s;even years; he has, by his indu&s;try and good
under&s;tanding in bu&s;ine&s;s, ju&s;t got into a flou|ri&s;hing
trade, by which he clears five or &s;ix
hundred pounds a year; and if it &s;hould plea&s;e
God to &s;pare his life for twenty years or more,
he would certainly be a rich man, and get a
good e&s;tate; but on a &s;udden, and in the mid|dle
of all his pro&s;perity, he is &s;natch'd away by
a &s;udden fit of &s;ickne&s;s, and his widow is left
in a de&s;olate de&s;pairing condition, having five
children, and big with another, but the elde&s;t
of the&s;e is not above &s;ix years old; and tho' he
is a boy, yet he is utterly uncapable to be con|cerned
in the bu&s;ine&s;s; &s;o the trade which (had his
fa$her lived to bring him up in his &s;hop or ware|hou&s;e)
<PB N="359" REF="380">
would have been an e&s;tate to him, is
like to be lo&s;t, and perhaps go all away to the
elde&s;t Apprentice, who however wants two years
of his time: Now what is to be done for this
unhappy family?</P>
<P>Done! &s;ays the Widow, why I will never let
the trade fall &s;o, that &s;hould be the making of
my &s;on, and in the mean time be the mainte|nance
of all my children.</P>
<P>WHY what can you do, child, <HI>&s;ays her Father</HI>
or other Friends? you know nothing of it,
Mr.&mdash;did not acquaint you with his
bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>THAT'S true, &s;ays the Widow, he did not, be|cau&s;e
I was a fool, and did not care to look
much into it, and that was my fault; Mr.&mdash;
did not pre&s;s me to it, becau&s;e he was afraid I
might think he intended to put me upon it, but
he often u&s;ed to &s;ay, that if he &s;hould drop off
before his boys were fit to come into the &s;hop,
it would be a &s;ad lo&s;s to them; that the trade
would make gentlemen of a couple of them, and
it would be great pity it &s;hould go away from
them.</P>
<P>BUT what does that &s;ignify now, child, <HI>adds
the Father,</HI> you &s;ee it is &s;o; and how can it be
helped?</P>
<P>WHY, <HI>&s;ays the widow,</HI> I u&s;ed to ask him if
he thought I could carry it on for them, if
&s;uch a thing &s;hould happen?</P>
<P>AND what an&s;wer did he make? <HI>&s;ays the
Father?</HI></P>
<P>HE &s;hook his head, <HI>replied the Widow,</HI> and
an&s;wer'd, Yes, I might if I had good &s;ervants,
<PB N="360" REF="381">
and if I would look a little into it before|hand.</P>
<P>WHY, <HI>&s;ays the Father,</HI> he talked as if he had
fore&s;een his end.</P>
<P>I think he did fore&s;ee it, <HI>&s;ays &s;he,</HI> for he was
often talking thus.</P>
<P>AND why did you not take the hint then,
<HI>&s;ays her Father,</HI> and acquaint your &s;elf a little
with things, that you might have been prepar'd
for &s;uch an unhappy circum&s;tance, whatever
might happen?</P>
<P>WHY &s;o I did, <HI>&s;ays the Widow,</HI> and have
done for above two years pa&s;t, he u&s;ed to &s;hew
me his letters, and his books, and I know where
he bought every thing; and I know a little of
goods too, when they arc good, and when bad,
and the prices; al&s;o I know all the country-people
he dealt with, and have &s;een mo&s;t of
them, and talk'd with them; Mr.&mdash;u&s;ed
to bring them up to dinner &s;ometimes, and he
would prompt my being acquainted with them,
and would &s;ometimes talk of his bu&s;ine&s;s with
them at table, on purpo&s;e that I might hear it;
and I know a little how to &s;ell too, for I have
&s;tood by him &s;ometimes, and &s;een the cu&s;tom|ers
and he chaffer with one another.</P>
<P>AND did your husband like that you did &s;o?
<HI>&s;ays the Father.</HI></P>
<P><HI>YES, &s;ays &s;he,</HI> he loved to &s;ee me do it, and
often told me he did &s;o; and told me, that if
he was dead, he believed I might carry on the
trade as well as he.</P>
<P>BUT he did not believe &s;o, I doubt, <HI>&s;ays the
Father,</HI></P>
<P><PB N="361" REF="382">
I do not know as to that, <HI>&s;ays &s;he;</HI> but I &s;old
goods &s;everal times to &s;ome cu&s;tomers, when he
has been out of the way.</P>
<P>AND was he plea&s;ed with it, <HI>&s;ays her Father,</HI>
when he came home? Did you do it to his
mind?</P>
<P>NAY, <HI>&s;ays &s;he,</HI> I have &s;erved a cu&s;tomer &s;ome|times
when he has been in the warehou&s;e, and
he would go away to his counting-hou&s;e on
purpo&s;e, and &s;ay, I'll leave you and my wife to
make the bargain; and I have plea&s;ed the cu&s;|tomer
and him too.</P>
<P>WELL, <HI>&s;ays the Father,</HI> do you think you
could carry on the trade?</P>
<P>I believe I could, if I had but an hone&s;t fel|low
of a journeyman for a year or two, to
write in the books, and go abroad among cu&s;|tomers.</P>
<P>WELL, <HI>&s;ays the Father,</HI> you have two appren|tices,
one of them begins to under&s;tand things
very much, and &s;eems to be a diligent lad.</P>
<P>HE comes forward, indeed, and will be very
u&s;eful, <HI>&s;ays the Widow,</HI> if he does not grow
too forward, upon a &s;uppo&s;ition that I &s;hall
want him too much; but it will be nece&s;&s;ary to
have a man to be above him for a while.</P>
<P>WELL, <HI>&s;ays the Father,</HI> we will &s;ee to get
you &s;uch a one.</P>
<P>IN &s;hort, they got her a man to a&s;&s;i&s;t to keep
the books, go to <HI>Exchange,</HI> and do the bu&s;ine&s;s
abroad, and the Widow carried on the bu&s;ine&s;s
with great application and &s;ucce&s;s, till her elde&s;t
&s;on grew up, and was fir&s;t taken into the &s;hop
<PB N="362" REF="383">
as an apprentice to his mother; the elde&s;t ap|prentice
&s;erv'd her faithfully, and was her jour|neyman
four years after his time was out; then
&s;he took him in partner to one fourth part of
the trade, and when her &s;on came of age, &s;he
gave the apprentice one of her daughters, and
enlarged his &s;hare to a third, gave her own
&s;on another third, and kept a third for her &s;elf,
to &s;upport the family.</P>
<P>THUS the whole trade was pre&s;erved, and the
&s;on and &s;on-in-law grew rich in it, and the Wi|dow,
who grew as skilful, in the bu&s;ine&s;s as her
husband was before her, advanced the fortunes
of all the re&s;t of her children very con&s;iderably.</P>
<P>THIS was an example of the husband's mak|ing
the wife (but a little) acquainted with his bu|&s;ine&s;s,
and if this had not been the ca&s;e, the
trade had been lo&s;t, and the family left ju&s;t to
divide what the father left; which, as they were
&s;even of them, mother and all, would not have
been con&s;iderable enough to have rai&s;ed them
above ju&s;t the degree of having bread to eat,
and none to &s;pare.</P>
<P>I hardly need give any examples where trade&s;|men
die, leaving flouri&s;hing bu&s;ine&s;s, and good
trades, but leaving their wives ignorant and de|&s;titute,
neither under&s;tanding their bu&s;ine&s;s, or
knowing how to learn, having been too proud
to &s;toop to it when they had husbands, and not
courage or heart to do it when they have none;
the Town is &s;o full of &s;uch as the&s;e, that this
book can &s;carce fall into the hands of any readers
but who will be able to name them among their
own acquaintance.</P>
<P><PB N="363" REF="384">
THESE indolent lofty Ladies have generally
the mortification to &s;ee their husband's trades
catch'd up by apprentices or journeymen in the
&s;hop, or by other &s;hop-keepers in the neighbour|hood,
and of the &s;ame bu&s;ine&s;s, that might have
enrich'd them, and de&s;cended to their children;
&s;o &s;ee their bread carried away by &s;trangers, and
other families flouri&s;hing on the &s;poils of their
fortunes.</P>
<P>AND this brings me to &s;peak of tho&s;e Ladies,
who, though they do perhaps, <HI>for want of bet|ter
offers,</HI> &s;toop to wed a trade, <HI>as we call it,</HI>
and take up with a Mechanick, yet all the while
they are the trade&s;mens wives, they endeavour
to pre&s;erve the di&s;tinction of their fancied cha|racter;
carry them&s;elves as if they thought they
were &s;till above their &s;tation, and that tho' they
were unhappily yoked with a trade&s;man, they
would &s;till keep up the dignity of their Birth,
and be call'd Gentlewomen; and in order to
this would behave like &s;uch all the way, what|ever
rank they were levell'd with by the misfor|tune
of their circum&s;tances.</P>
<P>THIS is a very unhappy, and indeed a mo&s;t
un&s;ea&s;onable kind of pride; and, if I might pre|&s;ume
to add a word here by way of caution
to &s;uch Ladies, it &s;hould be to con&s;ider, before
they marry trade&s;men, the great di&s;advantages they
lay them&s;elves under, in &s;ubmitting to be a trade&s;|man's
wife, but not putting them&s;elves in a
condition to take the benefit, as well as the in|convenience
of it; for while they are above
the circum&s;tances of the trade&s;man's wife, they
are depriv'd of all the remedy again&s;t the mi&s;e|ries
<PB N="364" REF="385">
of a trade&s;man's widow; and if the man
dies, and leaves them little or nothing but the
trade to carry on, and maintain them, they be|ing
unacquainted with that, <HI>are undone.</HI></P>
<P>A Lady, that &s;toops to marry a trade&s;man,
&s;hould con&s;ider the u&s;age of <HI>England</HI> among
the Gentry and per&s;ons of di&s;tinction, where the
ca&s;e is thus; if a Lady, who has a title of ho|nour,
&s;uppo&s;e it be a Counte&s;s, or if &s;he were
a Duche&s;s, it is all one, if, <HI>I &s;ay,</HI> &s;he &s;toops to
marry a private Gentleman, &s;he cea&s;es to rank
for the future as a Counte&s;s, or Duche&s;s, but
mu&s;t be content to be, for the time to come,
what her husband can entitle her to, and no
other; and excepting the courte&s;y of the peo|ple,
calling her my Lady Duche&s;s, or the Coun|te&s;s,
&s;he is no more than plain mi&s;tre&s;s&mdash;
&s;uch a one, meaning the name of her husband,
and no other.</P>
<P>THUS if a Baronet's widow marries a trade&s;|man
in <HI>London,</HI> &s;he is no more <HI>my Lady,</HI> but
plain Mrs.&mdash;the Draper's wife, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The
application of the thing is thus; if the Lady
thinks fit to marry a mechanick, &s;ay a Glover,
or a Cutler, or whatever it is, &s;he &s;hould re|member
&s;he is a Glover's wife from that time,
and no more; and to keep up her dignity, when
fortune has levell'd her circum&s;tances, is but a
piece of un&s;ea&s;onable pageantry, and will do
her no &s;ervice at all: The thing &s;he is to en|quire
is, what &s;he mu&s;t do if Mr.&mdash;the
Glover, or Cutler, &s;hould die? whether &s;he can
carry on the trade afterward, or whether &s;he can
live without it? If &s;he finds &s;he cannot live with|out
<PB N="365" REF="386">
out it, 'tis her prudence to confider in time,
and &s;o to acquaint her&s;elf with the trade, that
&s;he may be able to do it when &s;he comes to it.</P>
<P>I do confe&s;s, there is nothing more ridicu|lous
than the double pride of the Ladies of this
age, with re&s;pect to marrying what they call be|low
their birth; &s;ome Ladies of good families,
tho' but of mean fortune, are &s;o &s;tiff upon the
point of honour, that they refu&s;e to marry trade&s;men;
nay? even merchants, tho' va&s;tly above
them in wealth and fortune, only becau&s;e they
are trade&s;men, or, as they are pleas'd to call
them, tho' improperly, <HI>Mechanicks;</HI> and tho'
perhaps they have not above 500 <HI>l.</HI> or 1000 <HI>l.</HI>
to their portion, &s;corn the man for his rank,
who does but turn round, and has his choice
of wives, perhaps, with 2, or 3, or 4000 <HI>l.</HI> be|fore
their faces.</P>
<P>THE Gentlemen of quality, we &s;ee, act upon
quite another foot, and, I may &s;ay, with much
more judgment, &s;eeing nothing is more fre|quent
than when any noble family are loaded
with titles and honour rather than fortune, they
come down into the city, and choo&s;e wives a|mong
the merchants and trade&s;mens daughters
to rai&s;e their families; and I am mi&s;taken, if at
this time we have not &s;everal Duche&s;&s;es, Coun|te&s;&s;es,
and Ladies of rank, who are the daugh|ters
of citizens and trade&s;men, as the Duche&s;s of
<HI>B</HI>&mdash;<HI>d,</HI> of <HI>A</HI>&mdash;<HI>e,</HI> of <HI>Wh</HI>&mdash;<HI>n</HI> and others;
the Counte&s;s of <HI>Ex</HI>&mdash;<HI>r,</HI> of <HI>On&s;low,</HI> and ma|ny
more too many to name; where it is thought
no di&s;honour at all for tho&s;e per&s;ons to have
match'd into rich families, tho' not ennobled;
<PB N="366" REF="387">
and we have &s;een many trading families lay the
foundation of nobility by their wealth and opu|lence;
as Mr. <HI>Child</HI> for example, afterwards
Sir <HI>Jo&s;iah Child,</HI> whole pofterity by his two
daughters are now Dukes of <HI>Beaufort</HI> and of
<HI>Bedford,</HI> and his Grand&s;on Lord Vi&s;count <HI>Ca&s;tle|main,</HI>
and yet he him&s;elf began a mean trade&s;|man,
and in circum&s;tances very mean.</P>
<P>BUT this &s;tiffne&s;s of the Ladies, in refu&s;ing
to marry trade&s;men, though it is weak in it&s;elf,
is not near &s;o weak as the folly of tho&s;e who
fir&s;t do &s;toop to marry thus, and yet think to
maintain the dignity of their birth, in &s;pight of
the meanne&s;s of their fortune; and &s;o carry|ing
them&s;elves above that &s;tation, in which Pro|vidence
has placed them, di&s;able them&s;elves from
receiving the benefit which their condition offers
them, upon any &s;ub&s;equent changes of their life.</P>
<P>THIS extraordinary &s;tiffne&s;s, I have known,
has brought many a well-bred Gentlewoman to
mi&s;ery and the utmo&s;t di&s;tre&s;s, whereas had they
been able to have &s;tooped to the &s;ub&s;equent cir|cum&s;tances
of life, which Providence al&s;o thought
fit to make their lot, they might have lived com|fortably
and plentifully all their days.</P>
<P>IT is certainly every Lady's prudence to bring
her &s;pirit down to her condition; and if &s;he
thinks fit, or it is any how her lot to marry a
trade&s;man, which many Ladies of good families
have found it for their advantage to do; I &s;ay,
If it be her lot, &s;he &s;hould take care &s;he does
not make that a cur&s;e to her, which would be
her ble&s;&s;ing, by de&s;pi&s;ing her own condition,
and putting her&s;elf into a po&s;ture not to en|joy
it.</P>
<P><PB N="367" REF="388">
IN all this I am to be under&s;tood to mean
that unhappy temper, which I find &s;o much a|mong
the trade&s;mens wives at this time, of be|ing
above taking any notice of their husbands
affairs; as if nothing was before them but a
con&s;tant &s;ettled &s;tate of pro&s;perity, and it was
impo&s;&s;ible for them to ta&s;t any other fortune;
whereas that very hour they embark with a trade&s;|man
they ought to remember, that they are en|tring
a &s;tate of life full of accidents and hazards,
and that innumerable families in as good cir|cum&s;tances

and has been forced to fly to the <HI>Ea&s;t</HI> or <HI>We&s;t-Indies,</HI>
and for&s;ake his family in &s;earch of

<P>WOMEN, when, once they give them&s;elves
leave to &s;toop to their own circum&s;tances, and
think fit to rouze up them&s;elves to their own

as &s;ome would make them appear in the world;
and we &s;ee whole families in trade frequently
recover'd by their indu&s;try; but then they are
&s;uch women as can &s;toop to it, and can lay
a&s;ide the particular pride of their fir&s;t years; and
who, without looking back to what they have
been, can be content to look into what Provi|dence
<PB N="368" REF="389">
has brought them to be, and what they mu&s;t
infallibly be, if they do not vigorou&s;ly apply
to the affairs which offer, and fall into the bu&s;i|ne&s;s
which their husbands leave them the intro|duction
to, and do not level their minds to their
condition: It may indeed be hard to do this at
fir&s;t, but nece&s;&s;ity is a &s;pur to indu&s;try, and will
make things ea&s;y, where they &s;eem difficult;
and this nece&s;&s;ity will humble the minds of tho&s;e
whom nothing el&s;e could make to &s;toop; and
where it does not, 'tis a defect of the under|&s;tanding,
as well as of prudence, and mu&s;t re|flect

<HEAD>LETTER XXII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Dignity of Trade in England more than
in other Countries.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_IT is &s;aid of <HI>England</HI> by way of di|&s;tinction,
and we all value our&s;elves
upon it, that it is a trading country;
and King <HI>Charles</HI> II. who was per|haps
that Prince of all the Kings that ever reign'd
in <HI>England,</HI> that be&s;t under&s;tood the country
<PB N="369" REF="390">
and the people that he govern'd, us'd to &s;ay,
<HI>That the Trade&s;men were the only Gentry in</HI> Eng|land:
His Maje&s;ty &s;poke it merrily, but it had, a
happy &s;ignification in it, &s;uch as was peculiar to
the bright genius of that Prince, who tho' he
was not the be&s;t governour, was the be&s;t ac|quainted
with the world, of all the Princes of his
age, if not of all the men in it; and tho' it be a
digre&s;&s;ion give me leave, after having quoted the
King, to add three &s;hort ob&s;ervations of my
own, in favour of <HI>England,</HI> and of the peo|ple
and trade of it, and yet without the lea&s;t
partiality to our own country.</P>
<P>I. WE are not only A trading country, but
the greate&s;t trading country in the world.</P>
<P>II. OUR climate is the mo&s;t agreeable climate
in the world to live in.</P>
<P>III. OUR <HI>Engli&s;hmen</HI> are the &s;toute&s;t and be&s;t
men (I mean what we call men of their
hands) in the world.</P>
<P>THESE are great things to advance in our own
favour, and yet to pretend not to be partial too;
and therefore I &s;hall give my rea&s;ons, which I
think &s;upport my opinion, and they &s;hall be as
&s;hort as the heads them&s;elves, that I may not
go too much off from my &s;ubject.</P>
<P>1. WE are the greate&s;t trading country in
the world, becau&s;e we have the greate&s;t ex|portation
of the growth and product of our
<PB N="370" REF="391">
land, and of the manufacture and labour of
our people; and the greate&s;t importation and
con&s;umption of the growth, product, and ma|nufactures
of other countries from abroad, of
any nation in the world.</P>
<P>2. OUR climate is the be&s;t and mo&s;t agree|able,
becau&s;e a man can be more out of doors
in <HI>England</HI> than in other countries. This
was King <HI>Charles</HI> the &s;econd's rea&s;on for it;
and I cannot name it, without doing ju&s;tice
to his Maje&s;ty in it.</P>
<P>3. OUR men are the <HI>&s;toute&s;t</HI> and <HI>be&s;t,</HI> be|cau&s;e
&s;trip them, naked from the wa&s;t upwards,
and give them no weapons at all but their
Hands and Heels, and turn them into a room,
or &s;tage, and lock them in with the like num|ber
of other men of any nation, man for
man, and they &s;hall beat the be&s;t men you
&s;hall find in the world.</P>
<P>FROM this digre&s;&s;ion, which I hope will not
be di&s;agreeable, as it is not very tedious, I come
back to my fir&s;t ob&s;ervration, that <HI>England</HI> is a
trading country; and two things I offer from
that head.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> OUR tradesmen are not, as in other
countries, the meane&s;t of our people.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> SOME of the greate&s;t and be&s;t,
and mo&s;t flouri&s;hing families among not the
gentry only, but even the nobility, have been
rais'd from trade, owe their beginning, their
wealth, and their e&s;tates to trade; and I may
<PB N="371" REF="392">
<HI>Thirdly,</HI> THOSE families are not at all a|&s;hamed
of their original, and indeed have no
occa&s;ion to be a&s;hamed of it.</P>
<P>IT is true, that in <HI>England</HI> we have a nume|rous
and an illu&s;trious Mobility and Gentry; and
it is true al&s;o, that not &s;o many of tho&s;e fami|lies
have rais'd them&s;elves by the &s;word as in o|ther
nations, though we have not been without
men of &s;ame in the field too.</P>
<P>BUT <HI>Trade</HI> and <HI>Learning</HI> has been the two
chief &s;teps, by which our gentlemen have rais'd
their relations, and have built their fortunes;
and from which, they have a&s;cended up to the
prodigious height, both in wealth and number,
which we &s;ee them now ri&s;en to.</P>
<P>AS &s;o many of our noble and wealthy fami|lies
are rais'd by, and derive from trade, &s;o it
is true, and indeed it cannot well be otherwi&s;e,
that many of the younger branches of our gen|try,
and even of the nobility it&s;elf, have de&s;cended
again into the &s;pring from whence they flow'd,
and have become trade&s;men; and thence it is,
that, as I faid above, our trade&s;men in <HI>England</HI>
are not, <HI>as it generally is in other countries,</HI> al|ways
of the meane&s;t of our people.</P>
<P>INDEED I might have added here, that trade
it&s;elf in <HI>England</HI> is not, as it generally is in o|ther
countries, the meane&s;t thing the men can
turn their hand to; but on the contrary trade
is the readie&s;t way for men to rai&s;e their for|tunes
and families; and therefore it is a field for
men of figure and of good families to enter
upon.</P>
<Q><PB N="372" REF="393">
<HI>N. B.</HI> By trade we mu&s;t be under&s;tood to
include Navigation, and foreign di&s;co|veries,
becau&s;e they are generally &s;peak|ing
all promoted and carried on by trade,
and even, by trade&s;men, as well as mer|chants;
and the trade&s;men are at this
time as much concern'd in &s;hipping (as
Owners) as the merchants, only the lat|ter
may be &s;aid to be the chief employ|ers
of the &s;hipping.</Q>
<P>HAVING thus done a particular piece of ju&s;t|ice
to our&s;elves, in the value we put upon trade
and trade&s;men in <HI>England,</HI> it reflects very much
upon the under&s;tandings of tho&s;e refin'd heads,
who <HI>pretend to</HI> depreciate that part of the na|tion,
which is &s;o infinitely &s;uperiour in number
and in wealth to the families who call them|&s;elves
gentry; or quality, and &s;o infinitely more
numerous.</P>
<P>AS to the wealth of the nation, that undoubt|edly
lies chiefly among the trading part of the
people; and tho' there are a great many famil|ies
rais'd within few years, in the late war by
great employments, and by great actions abroad,
to the honour of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> gentry; yet how
many more families among the trade&s;men have
been rais'd to immen&s;e e&s;tates, even during the
&s;ame time, by the attending circum&s;tances of
the war? &s;uch as the cloathing, the paying, the
victualling and furni&s;hing, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> both army and
navy? And by whom have the prodigious taxes
been paid, the loans &s;upplied, and money ad|vanced
<PB N="373" REF="394">
upon all occa&s;ions? By whom are the
Banks and Companies carried on? And on whom
are the Cu&s;toms and Exci&s;es levied? Has not
the trade and trade&s;men born the burthen of
the war? And do they not &s;till pay four millions
a year intere&s;t for the publick debts? On whom
are the funds levied, and by whom the publick
credit &s;upported? Is not trade the inexhau&s;ted
fund of all funds, and upon which all the re&s;t
depend?</P>
<P>AS is the trade, &s;o in proportion are the
trade&s;men; and how wealthy are trade&s;men in
almo&s;t all the &s;everal parts of <HI>England,</HI> as well
as in <HI>London?</HI> How ordinary is it to &s;ee a trade&s;|man
go off of the &s;tage, even but from mere
&s;hop-keeping, with, from ten to forty thou&s;and
pounds e&s;tate, to divide among his family? when,
on the contrary, take the gentry in <HI>England</HI>
from one end to the other, except a few here
and there, what with exce&s;&s;ive high living,
which is of late grown &s;o much into a di&s;|ea&s;e,
and the other ordinary circum&s;tances of
families, we find few families of the lower gen|try,
that is to &s;ay, from &s;ix or &s;even hundred
a year downwards, but they are in debt and in
nece&s;&s;itous circum&s;tances, and a great many of
greater e&s;tates al&s;o.</P>
<P>ON the other hand, let any one who is ac|quainted
with <HI>England,</HI> look but abroad into
the &s;everal counties, e&s;pecially near <HI>London,</HI> or
within fifty miles of it: How are the antient
families worn out by time and family misfor|tunes,
and the e&s;tates po&s;&s;e&s;s'd by a new race of
trade&s;men, grown up into families of gentry,
<PB N="374" REF="395">
and e&s;tabli&s;h'd by the immen&s;e wealth, gain'd,
as I may &s;ay, behind the counter; that is, in the
&s;hop, the warehou&s;e, and the compting-hou&s;e?
How are the &s;ons of trade&s;men rank'd among the
prime of the gentry? How are the daughters of
trade&s;men at this time adorn'd with the ducal
coronets, and &s;een riding in the coaches of the
be&s;t of our nobility? Nay, many of our trading
gentlemen at this time refu&s;e to be Ennobled,
&s;corn being knighted, and content them&s;elves with
being known to be rated among the riche&s;t
Commoners in the nation: And it mu&s;t be ac|knowledg'd,
that whatever they be as to court|breeding,
and to manners, they, generally &s;peak|ing,
come behind none of the gentry in know|ledge
of the world.</P>
<P>AT this very day we &s;ee the &s;on of Sir <HI>Tho|mas
Scawen</HI> match'd into the ducal family of
<HI>Bedford,</HI> and the &s;on of Sir <HI>James Bateman</HI>
into the princely hou&s;e of <HI>Marlborough,</HI> both
who&s;e ance&s;tors, within the memory of the wri|ters
of the&s;e &s;heets, were trade&s;men in <HI>London;</HI>
the fir&s;t Sir <HI>William Scawen's</HI> apprentice, and
the later's grandfather a <HI>P</HI>&mdash;upon, or near,
<HI>London-Bridge.</HI></P>
<P>HOW many noble &s;eats, &s;uperior to the pala|ces
of &s;overeign Princes (in &s;ome countries) do
we &s;ee erected within few miles of this city by
trade&s;men, or the &s;ons of trade&s;men, while the
&s;eats and ca&s;tles of the antient gentry, like their
families, look <HI>worn out,</HI> and fallen into <HI>decay;</HI>
witne&s;s the noble hou&s;e of Sir <HI>John Eyles,</HI>
him&s;elf a Merchant, at <HI>Giddy-hall</HI> near <HI>Rum|ford;</HI>
Sir <HI>Gregory Page</HI> on <HI>Black-heath,</HI> the
<PB N="375" REF="396">
&s;on of a <HI>Brewer;</HI> Sir <HI>Natthanael Mead</HI> near
<HI>Weal-green,</HI> his father a <HI>Linen-Draper,</HI> with
many others, too long to repeat; and to crown
all, the Lord <HI>Ca&s;tlemain</HI>'s at <HI>Wan&s;tead,</HI> his fa|ther
Sir <HI>Jo&s;iah Child</HI> originally a Trade&s;man.</P>
<P>IT was a &s;mart, but ju&s;t repartee of a <HI>Lon|don</HI>
trade&s;man, when a gentleman <HI>who had a
good e&s;tate too,</HI> rudely reproach'd him in com|pany,
and bad him hold his tongue, for he was
no Gentleman; <HI>No, Sir,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>but I can
buy a Gentleman,</HI> and therefore I claim a liber|ty
to &s;peak among Gentlemen.</P>
<P>AGAIN, in how &s;uperior a port or figure (as
we now call it) do our trade&s;men live, to what
the middling gentry either do or can &s;upport?
An ordinary trade&s;man now, not in the city
only, but in the country, &s;hall &s;pend more mo|ney
by the year, than a gentleman of four or
five hundred pounds a year can do; and &s;hall
encrea&s;e and lay up every year too; whereas
the gentleman, &s;hall at the be&s;t &s;tand &s;tock &s;till,
ju&s;t where he began, nay, perhaps decline; and
as for the lower gentry, from an hundred pounds
a year to three hundred, or thereabouts, <HI>though
they are often as proud and high in their ap|pearance
as the other;</HI> as to them, I &s;ay, a
<HI>Shoemaker</HI> in <HI>London</HI> &s;hall keep a better hou&s;e,
&s;pend more money, cloath his family better, and
yet grow rich too: It is evident where the dif|ference
lies, <HI>an E&s;tate's a pond,</HI> but <HI>a Trade's a
&s;pring;</HI> The fir&s;t, if it keeps full, and the wa|ter
whole&s;om, by the ordinary &s;upplies and dreins
from the neighbouring grounds, 'tis well, and 'tis
all that is expected; but the other is an inex|hau&s;ted
<PB N="376" REF="397">
current, which not only fills the pond,
and keeps it full, but is continually running o|ver,
and fills all the lower ponds and places a|bout
it.</P>
<P>THIS being the ca&s;e in <HI>England,</HI> and our
trade being &s;o va&s;tly great, it is no wonder that
the trade&s;men in <HI>England</HI> fill the li&s;ts of our no|bility
and gentry; no wonder that the gentle|men
of the be&s;t families marry trade&s;men's
daughters, and put their younger &s;ons appren|tices
to trade&s;men; and how often do the&s;e
younger &s;ons come to buy the elder &s;ons e&s;tates,
and re&s;tore the family, when, the elder, and head
of the hou&s;e, proving raki&s;h and extravagant,
has wa&s;ted his patrimony, and is obliged to
make out the ble&s;&s;ing of <HI>I&s;rael</HI>'s family, where
the younger &s;on bought the birth-right, and the
elder was doom'd to &s;erve him?</P>
<P>TRADE is &s;o far <HI>here</HI> from being incon&s;i&s;tent
with a Gentleman, that <HI>in &s;hort</HI> trade in <HI>Eng|land</HI>
makes Gentlemen, and has peopled this na|tion
with Gentlemen; for after a generation or
two the trade&s;men's children, or at lea&s;t their
grand-children, come to be as good Gentlemen,
State&s;men, Parliament-men, Privy-Coun&s;ellors,
Judges, Bi&s;hops, and Noblemen, as tho&s;e of the
highe&s;t birth and the mo&s;t antient families; and
nothing too high for them: Thus the late Earl
of <HI>Haver&s;ham</HI> was originally a Merchant, the
late Secretary <HI>Craggs</HI> was the &s;on of a <HI>Barber;</HI>
the pre&s;ent Lord <HI>Ca&s;tlemain's</HI> father was a Trade&s;|man;
the great grandfather of the pre&s;ent Duke
of <HI>Bedford</HI> the &s;ame, and &s;o of &s;everal others:
Nor do we find any defect either in the genius or
<PB N="377" REF="398">
capacities of the po&s;terity of trade&s;men, ari&s;ing
from any remains of mechanick blood, which
'tis pretended &s;hould influence them; but all
the gallantry of &s;pirit, greatne&s;s of &s;oul, and all the
generous principles, that can be found in any of
the antient families, who&s;e blood is the mo&s;t
untainted, as they call it, with the low mixtures
of a mechanick race, are found in the&s;e; and,
as is &s;aid before, they generally go beyond them
in knowledge of the world, which is the be&s;t
education.</P>
<P>WE &s;ee the trade&s;men of <HI>England,</HI> as they
grow wealthy, coming every day to the Herald's
office, to &s;earch for the Coats of Arms of their
ance&s;tors, in order to paint them upon their
coaches, and engrave them upon their plate, em|broider
them upon their furniture, or carve them
upon the pediments of their new hou&s;es; and
how often do we &s;ee them trace the regi&s;ters of
their families up to the prime nobility, or the
mo&s;t antient gentry of the kingdom?</P>
<P>IN this &s;earch we find them often qualified
to rai&s;e new families, if they do not de&s;cend
from old; as was &s;aid of a certain trade&s;man
of <HI>London,</HI> that if he could not find the anti|ent
race of Gentlemen, from which he came,
he would begin a new race, who &s;hould be as
good Gentlemen as any that went before them:
They tell us a &s;tory of the old Lord <HI>Craven,</HI>
who was afterwards created Earl of <HI>Craven</HI> by
King <HI>Charles</HI> II. that being upbraided with his
being of an up&s;tart nobility, by the famous <HI>Au|bery,</HI>
Earl of <HI>Oxford,</HI> who was him&s;elf of the
very antient family of the <HI>Veres,</HI> Earls of <HI>Ox|ford,</HI>
<PB N="378" REF="399">
the Lord <HI>Craven</HI> told him, he (<HI>Craven</HI>)
would Cap pedigrees with him (<HI>Oxford</HI>) for a
wager; the Earl of <HI>Oxford</HI> laugh'd at the chal|lenge,
and began, reckoning up his famous an|ce&s;tors,
who had been Earls of <HI>Oxford</HI> for an
hundred years pa&s;t, and Knights for &s;ome hun|dreds
of years more; but when my Lord <HI>Cra|ven</HI>
began, he read over his family thus; I am
<HI>William</HI> Lord <HI>Craven,</HI> my father was <HI>Lord</HI> May|or
of <HI>London,</HI> and my grandfather was the <HI>Lord
knows who;</HI> wherefore I think my pedigree as
good as yours, my Lord, (meaning the Earl of
<HI>Oxford:</HI>) The &s;tory was merry enough, but is
to my purpo&s;e exactly; for let the grandfa|ther
be who he would, his father Sir <HI>William
Craven,</HI> who was Lord-Mayor of <HI>London,</HI> was
a Whole&s;ale-<HI>Grocer,</HI> and rais'd the family by
trade, and yet no body doubts but that the fa|mily
of <HI>Craven</HI> is at this day, as truly noble in
all the beauties which adorn noble birth and
blood, as can be de&s;ir'd of any family, however
antient, or antiently noble.</P>
<P>IN <HI>Italy,</HI> and especially at <HI>Venice,</HI> we &s;ee e|very
day the &s;ons of merchants, and other trades,
who grow in wealth and e&s;tates, and can advance
for the &s;ervice of their country a con&s;iderable
&s;um of money, <HI>viz.</HI> 60000 to 100000 dollars,
are accepted to honour by the Senate, and tran&s;|lated
into the li&s;t of the nobility; without any
regard to the antiquities of their families, or the
nobility of blood; and in all ages the be&s;t Kings
and &s;overeign Princes have thought fit to re|ward
the extraordinary merit of their &s;ubjects
with titles of honour, and to rank men among
<PB N="379" REF="400">
their nobility, who have de&s;erv'd it by good
and great actions, whether their birth and the
antiquity of their families entituled them to it,
or not.</P>
<P>THUS in the late wars between <HI>England</HI> and
<HI>France,</HI> how was our army full of excellent
officers, who went from <HI>the &s;hop,</HI> and from be|hind
<HI>the counter,</HI> into the camp, and who di|&s;tingui&s;h'd
them&s;elves there by their merit and
gallant behaviour? And &s;everal &s;uch came to
command Regiments, and even to be General
Officers, and to gain as much reputation in the
&s;ervice as any; as Colonel <HI>Peirce, Wood, Rich|ards,</HI>
and &s;everal others, that might be nam'd.</P>
<P>ALL this confirms what I have &s;aid before,
<HI>viz.</HI> that trade in <HI>England</HI> neither is or ought
to be levell'd with what it is in other countries;
or the Trade&s;men depreciated as they are abroad,
and as &s;ome of our Gentry would pretend to do
in <HI>England;</HI> but that as many of our be&s;t fa|milies
ro&s;e from trade, &s;o many branches of the
be&s;t families in <HI>England,</HI> under the nobility,
have &s;toop'd &s;o low as to be put apprentices to
trade&s;men in <HI>London,</HI> and to &s;et up and follow
tho&s;e trades when they have come out of their
times, and have thought it no dishonour to their blood.</P>
<P>TO bring this once more home to the La|dies,
who are &s;o &s;candaliz'd at that mean &s;tep,
which they call it, of marrying a Trade&s;man; it
may be told them for their humiliation, that,
however they think fit to act, &s;ometimes tho&s;e
trade&s;men come of better families than their
own; and oftentimes, when they have refus'd
<PB N="380" REF="401">
them to their lo&s;s, tho&s;e very trade&s;men have
married Ladies of &s;uperior fortune to them,
and have rais'd families of their own, who in
one generation have been &s;uperiour to tho&s;e nice
Ladies both in dignity and e&s;tate, and have, to
their great mortification, been rank'd above them
upon all publick occa&s;ions.</P>
<P>THE word <HI>Trade&s;man</HI> in <HI>England</HI> does not
&s;ound &s;o har&s;h, as it does in other countries;
and to &s;ay a Gentleman-trade&s;man is not &s;o much
non&s;en&s;e, as &s;ome people would per&s;uade us to
reckon it; and indeed, as trade is now flou|rishing
in <HI>England,</HI> and encrea&s;ing, and the
wealth of our trade&s;men is already &s;o great; 'tis
very probable, a few years will &s;hew us &s;till a
greater race of trade-bred Gentlemen, than ever
<HI>England</HI> yet had.</P>
<P>THE very name of an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> trade&s;man will
and does already obtain in the world; and as
our &s;oldiers by the late war gain'd the reputation
of being &s;ome of the be&s;t troops in the world,
and our &s;eamen are at this day, and very ju&s;tly
too, e&s;teem'd the be&s;t Sailors in the world; &s;o
the <HI>Engli&s;h Trade&s;men</HI> may in a few years be
allow'd to rank with the be&s;t gentlemen in <HI>Eu|rope;</HI>
and as the Prophet <HI>I&s;aiah</HI> &s;aid of the
merchants of <HI>Tyre,</HI> that <HI>her traffickers were the
Honourable of the earth,</HI> I&s;ai. xxiii. 8.</P>
<P>IN the mean time, 'tis evident their wealth
at this time out-does that of the like rank of
any nation in <HI>Europe;</HI> and as their number is
prodigious, &s;o is their commerce; for the in|land
commerce of <HI>England</HI> (and 'tis of tho&s;e
<HI>trade&s;men,</HI> or <HI>traffickers,</HI> that I am now &s;peak|ing
<PB N="381" REF="402">
in particular) is certainly the greate&s;t of its
kind of any in the world; nor is it po&s;&s;ible
there &s;hould ever be any like it, the con&s;ump|tion
of all &s;orts of goods, both of our own
manufacture, and of foreign growth, being &s;o
exceeding great.</P>
<P>IF the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> nation was to be nearly en|quired
into, and its pre&s;ent opulence and great|ne&s;s
duly weigh'd, it would appear, that as the
figure it now makes in <HI>Europe</HI> is greater than
it ever made before, take it either in King <HI>Ed|ward</HI>
the Third's reign, or in Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI>'s,
which were the two chief points of time when
the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> &s;ame was in its highe&s;t extent; <HI>I &s;ay,</HI>
if its pre&s;ent greatne&s;s was to be duly weighed,
there is no compari&s;on in its wealth, The num|ber
of its people, the value of its lands, the
greatne&s;s of the e&s;tates of its private inhabi|tants,
and (in con&s;equence of all this) its real
&s;trength is infinitely beyond whatever it was be|fore;
and if it were needful, I could fill up this
work with a very agreeable and u&s;eful enquiry
into the particulars.</P>
<P>BUT I content my &s;elf with turning it to the
ca&s;e in hand, for the truth of fact is not to be
di&s;puted: <HI>I &s;ay,</HI> I turn it to the ca&s;e in hand
<HI>thus,</HI> Whence comes it to be &s;o? How is it pro|duced?
War has not done it; no, nor &s;o much
as helped or a&s;&s;i&s;ted to it; it is not by any mar|tial
exploits; we have made no conque&s;ts abroad,
added no new kingdoms to the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> empire,
reduced no neighbouring nations, or extended
the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of our monarchs into the proper|ties
of others; we have gain'd nothing by war
<PB N="382" REF="403">
and encroachment; we are Butted and Bounded
ju&s;t where we were in Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI>'s time;
the <HI>Dutch,</HI> the <HI>Flemings,</HI> the <HI>French,</HI> are in view
of us, ju&s;t as they were then; we have &s;ubjected
no new provinces or people to our govern|ment;
and with few or no exceptions, we are
almo&s;t for dominion where King <HI>Edward</HI> I.
left us; nay, we have lo&s;t all the dominions
which our antient Kings for &s;ome hundreds of
years held in <HI>France;</HI> &s;uch as the rich and pow|erful
provinces of <HI>Normandy, Poictou, Ga&s;|cogne,
Bretaign,</HI> and <HI>Acquitain;</HI> and in&s;tead of
being enrich'd by war and victory, on the con|trary
we have been torn in pieces by civil wars
and rebellions, as well in <HI>Ireland</HI> as in <HI>Eng|land;</HI>
and that &s;everal times; to the ruin of our
riche&s;t families, and the &s;laughter of our Nobi|lity
and Gentry; nay, to the de&s;truction even of
monarchy it &s;elf, and this many years at a time,
as in the long bloody wars between the hou&s;es
of <HI>Lanca&s;ter</HI> and <HI>York,</HI> the many rebellions of
the <HI>Iri&s;h,</HI> as well in Queen <HI>Elizabeth's</HI> time, as
in King <HI>Charles</HI> the Fir&s;t's time, and the fatal
ma&s;&s;acre, and almo&s;t extirpation of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>
name in that kingdom; and at la&s;t, the late re|bellion
in <HI>England,</HI> in which the Monarch fell
a &s;acrifice to the fury of the people, and Mo|narchy
it &s;elf gave way to tyranny and u&s;urpa|tion,
for almo&s;t twenty years.</P>
<P>THESE things prove abundantly that the ri|&s;ing
greatne&s;s of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> nation is not ow|ing
to war and conque&s;ts, to enlarging its do|minion
by the &s;word, or &s;ubjecting the people
of other countries to our power; but it is all
<PB N="383" REF="404">
owing to trade, to the encrea&s;e of our com|merce
at home, and the extending it abroad.</P>
<P>IT is owing to trade, that new di&s;coveries
have been made in lands unknown, and new
&s;ettlements and plantations made, new colonies
placed, and new governments formed in the
uninhabited i&s;lands, and the uncultivated conti|nent
of <HI>America;</HI> and tho&s;e plantings and &s;et|tlements
have again enlarged and encrea&s;ed the
trade, and thereby the wealth and power of the
nation, by whom they were di&s;covered and
planted: We have not encrea&s;ed our power, or
the number of our &s;ubjects, by &s;ubduing the
nations which po&s;&s;e&s;s'd tho&s;e countries, and en|corporating
them into our own; but have en|tirely
planted our colonies, and peopled the
countries with our own &s;ubjects, natives of this
i&s;land; and, excepting the negroes, which we
tran&s;port from <HI>Africa</HI> to <HI>America,</HI> as &s;laves to
work in the &s;ugar and tobacco plantations; all
our Colonies, as well in the i&s;lands as on the
continent of <HI>America,</HI> are entirely peopled from
<HI>Great Britain</HI> and <HI>Ireland,</HI> and chiefly the for|mer;
the natives having either removed farther
up into the country, or by their own folly and
treachery rai&s;ing war again&s;t us, been de&s;troy'd
and cut off.</P>
<P>As trade alone has peopled tho&s;e countries,
&s;o trading with them has rais'd them al&s;o to a
prodigy of wealth and Opulence; and we &s;ee
now the ordinary planters at <HI>Jamaica</HI> and <HI>Bar|badoes</HI>
ri&s;e to immen&s;e e&s;tates, riding in their
coaches and &s;ix, e&s;pecially at <HI>Jamaica,</HI> with
twenty or thirty negroes on foot running be|fore
<PB N="384" REF="405">
them whenever they plea&s;e to appear in
publick.</P>
<P>AS trade has thus extended our Colonies a|broad,
&s;o it has (except tho&s;e Colonies) kept
our people at home, where they are multiplied
to that prodigious degree, and do &s;till continue
to multiply in &s;uch a manner, that if it goes on
&s;o, time may come that all the lands in <HI>Eng|land</HI>
will do little more than &s;erve for gardens
for them, and to feed their cows; and their
corn and cattle be &s;upplied from <HI>Scotland</HI> and
<HI>Ireland.</HI></P>
<P>WHAT is the rea&s;on that we &s;ee numbers of
<HI>French,</HI> and of <HI>Scots,</HI> and of <HI>Germans,</HI> in all
the foreign nations in <HI>Europe;</HI> and e&s;pecially
filling up their armies and courts, and that you
&s;ee few or no <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> there?</P>
<P>WHAT is the rea&s;on, that when we want to
rai&s;e armies, or to man navies in <HI>England,</HI> we
are oblig'd to pre&s;s the &s;eamen, and to make
laws and empower the ju&s;tices of the peace,
and magi&s;trates of towns, to force men to go
for &s;oldiers, and enter into the &s;ervice, or al|lure
them by giving Bounty-money as an en|couragement
to men to li&s;t them&s;elves? where|as
the people of other nations, and even the
<HI>Scots</HI> and <HI>Iri&s;h,</HI> travel abroad (and run into all
the neighbour nations) to &s;eek &s;ervice, and to be
admitted into their pay.</P>
<P>WHAT is it but trade? the encrea&s;e of bu&s;i|ne&s;s
at home, and the employment of the poor
in the bu&s;ine&s;s and manufactures of this king|dom,
by which the poor get &s;o good wages, and
live &s;o well, that they will not li&s;t for &s;oldiers;
<PB N="385" REF="406">
and have &s;o good pay in the merchants &s;ervice,
that they will not &s;erve on board the &s;hips of
war, unle&s;s they are forced to do it?</P>
<P>What is the rea&s;on, that in order to &s;upply
our Colonies&punc; and Plantations with people, be|&s;ides
the encouragement given in tho&s;e Colo|nies
to all people that will come there to plant
and to &s;ettle, we are obliged to &s;end away thi|ther
all our petty offenders, and all the crimi|nals
that we think fit to &s;pare from the Gal|lows,
be&s;ides that we formerly call'd the Kid|napping
trade, that is to &s;ay, the arts made u&s;e
of to wheedle and draw away young vagrant
and indigent people; and people of de&s;perate
fortunes, to &s;ell them&s;elves, that is, bind them|&s;elves
for &s;ervants, the numbers of which are
very great.</P>
<P>IT is poverty fills armies, mans navies, and
peoples Colonies: In vain the drums beat for
&s;oldiers, and the King's captains invite &s;eamen to
&s;erve in the armies for 5 <HI>d.</HI> a day, and in the
royal navy for 23 <HI>s. per</HI> month, in a country
where the ordinary Labourer can have 9 <HI>s.</HI> a
week for his labour, and the manufacturers
earn from is to 16<HI>s.</HI> a week for their work;
and while trade gives 30 <HI>s. per</HI> month wages to
the &s;eamen on board merchant &s;hips: Men will
always &s;tay or go, as the pay gives them encou|ragement;
and this is the rea&s;on why it has
been &s;o much more difficult to rai&s;e and recruit
armies in <HI>England,</HI> than it has been in <HI>Scotland</HI>
and <HI>Ireland, France</HI> and <HI>Germany.</HI></P>
<P>THE &s;ame trade that keeps our people at
home, is the cau&s;e of the well living of the
<PB N="386" REF="407">
people here; for as frugality is not the national
virtue of <HI>England,</HI> &s;o the people that get much
&s;pend much; and as they work hard, &s;o they
live well, eat and drink well, cloath warm,
and lodge &s;oft; in a word, the working ma|nufacturing
people of <HI>England</HI> eat the fat, and
drink the &s;weet, live better, and fare better,
than the working poor of any other nation in
<HI>Europe;</HI> they make better wages of their work,
and &s;pend more of the money upon their Backs
and Bellies, than in any other country: This
expence of the Poor, as it cau&s;es a prodigious
con&s;umption both of the provi&s;ions and of the
manufactures of our country at home, &s;o two
things are undeniably the con&s;equence of that
part.</P>
<Q><LIST>
<ITEM>1. THE con&s;umption of provi&s;ions en|crea&s;es
the rent and value of the lands, and
this rai&s;es the Gentlemens e&s;tates, and that
again encrea&s;es the employment of people,
and con&s;equently the numbers of them, as
well tho&s;e who are employ'd in the husban|dry
of land, breeding and feeding of cattle, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
as of &s;ervants in the Gentlemens families, who
as their e&s;tates encrea&s;e in value, &s;o they en|crea&s;e
their families and equipages.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. As the people get greater wages, &s;o
they, I mean the &s;ame poorer part of the
people, clothe better, and furni&s;h better,
and this encrea&s;es the con&s;umption of the ve|ry
manufactures they make; then that con|&s;umption
encrea&s;es the quantity made, and this
creates what we call <HI>Inland trade,</HI> by which
<PB N="387" REF="408">
innumerable families are employ'd, and the
increa&s;e of the people maintain'd; and by
which encrea&s;e of trade and people the pre|&s;ent
growing pro&s;perity of this nation is pro|duced.</ITEM>
</LIST></Q>
<P>THE whole glory and greatne&s;s of <HI>England</HI>
then being thus rais'd by trade, it mu&s;t be un|accountable
folly and ignorance in us to le&s;&s;en
that one article in our own e&s;teem, which is
the only fountain from whence we all, <HI>take us
as a nation,</HI> are rai&s;ed, and by which we are
enriched and maintained. The Scripture &s;ays,
&s;peaking of the riches and glory of the city of
<HI>Tyre,</HI> which was indeed at that time the great
<HI>Port</HI> or <HI>Emporium</HI> of the world for foreign
commerce, from whence all the &s;ilks and fine
manufactures of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> and <HI>India</HI> were exported
all over the <HI>We&s;tern</HI> world, that <HI>her Merchants</HI>
were <HI>Princes;</HI> and in another place, <HI>By thy
traffick thou ha&s;t encrea&s;ed thy riches,</HI> Ezek.
xxviii. 5. Certain it is, that our traffick has
encrea&s;ed our riches; and 'tis al&s;o certain, that
the flouri&s;hing of our manufactures is the foun|dation
of all our traffick, as well our merchan|dize
as our inland trade.</P>
<P>THE Inland trade of <HI>England</HI> is a thing not
ea&s;ily de&s;cribed; it would, in a word, take up
a whole book by it &s;elf; it is the foundation of
all our wealth and greatne&s;s; it is the &s;upport
of all our foreign trade, and of our manufac|turing,
and, as I have hitherto written, of the
trade&s;men who carry it on; I &s;hall proceed with
a brief di&s;cour&s;e of the trade it &s;elf.</P>

Magnitude, and the great Advantage

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_I HAVE in a few words de&s;crib'd what I
mean by the Inland trade of <HI>England,</HI>
in the introduction to this work; It is
the circulation of commerce among our &s;elves.</P>
<Q><LIST>
<ITEM>I. FOR the carrying on our manufactures of
&s;everal kinds in the &s;everal counties where
they are made, and the employing the &s;eve|ral
&s;orts of people and trades needful for the
&s;aid manufactures.</ITEM>
<ITEM>II. FOR the rai&s;ing and vending provi&s;ions
of all kinds for the &s;upply of the va&s;t num|bers
of people who are employ'd every where
by the &s;aid manufactures.</ITEM>
<ITEM>III. FOR the importing and bringing in from
abroad all kinds of foreign growth and ma|nufactures
which we want.</ITEM>
<PB N="389" REF="410">
<ITEM>IV. FOR the carrying about and di&s;per&s;ing,
as well our own growth and manufactures as
the foreign imported growth and manufactures
of other nations to the retailer, and by them
to the la&s;t con&s;umer; which is the utmo&s;t end
of all Trade; and this in every part, to the ut|mo&s;t
corner of the i&s;land of <HI>Great Britain</HI>
and <HI>Ireland.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST></Q>
<P>THIS I call <HI>Inland Trade,</HI> and the&s;e Circula|tors
of goods, and Retailers of them to the la&s;t
con&s;umer, are tho&s;e whom we are to under&s;tand
by the word Trade&s;men, in all the parts of this
work; for, (as I ob&s;erved in the beginning) the
plowmen and farmers who labour at home,
and the merchant who imports our merchandize
from abroad, are nott all all meant or included;
and whatever I have been &s;aying, except where
they have been mentioned in particular and at
length.</P>
<P>THIS Inland trade is in it &s;elf at this time
the wonder of all the world of trade, nor is
there any thing like it now in the world, much
le&s;s that exceeds it, or perhaps ever will be, ex|cept
only what it &s;elf may grow up to in the
ages to come; for, as I have &s;aid on all occa&s;i|ons,
it is &s;till growing and encrea&s;ing.</P>
<P>BY this prodigy of a trade all the va&s;t impor|tation
from our own Colonies is circulated, and
di&s;per&s;t to the remote&s;t corner of the I&s;land,
whereby the con&s;umption is become &s;o great,
and by which tho&s;e Colonies are &s;o encrea&s;ed,
and are become &s;o populous and &s;o wealthy as
<PB N="390" REF="411">
I have already ob&s;erved of them: This impor|tation,
con&s;i&s;ts chiefly of Sugars and Tobacco;
of which the con&s;umption in <HI>Great Britain</HI> is
&s;carcely to be conceived of, be&s;ides the con|&s;umption
of Cotton, Indico, Rice, Ginger,
Piemento or <HI>Jamaica</HI> Pepper, Cocoa or Cho|colate,
Rum and Mela&s;&s;es; Train-Oil, Salt-Fi&s;h,
Whale-Fin, all &s;orts of Furs, abundance of va|luable
Drugs, Pitch, Tar, Turpentine, Deals,
Ma&s;ts and Timber, and many other things of
&s;maller value; all which, be&s;ides the employing
a very great number of &s;hips, and <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> &s;ea|men,
occa&s;ion again a very great exportation of
our own manufactures of all &s;orts, to tho&s;e Co|lonies;
which being circulated again for con|&s;umption
there, that circulation is to be account|ed
a branch of home or inland trade, as tho&s;e
Colonies are on all &s;uch occa&s;ions e&s;teemed as a
branch or part of our &s;elves, and of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI>
Government in the world.</P>
<P>THIS trade to our <HI>We&s;t Indies,</HI> and <HI>Ameri|can</HI>
Colonies, is very con&s;iderable, as it em|ploys
&s;o many &s;hips and &s;ailors, and &s;o much
of the growth of tho&s;e Colonies is again ex|ported
by us to other parts of the world, over
and above what is con&s;umed among us at home;
and al&s;o as all tho&s;e goods, and a great deal of
money in &s;pecie, is return'd hither for and in
ballance of our own manufactures and merchan|dizes
exported thither; on the&s;e accounts &s;ome
have in&s;i&s;ted that more real wealth is brought
into <HI>Great Britain</HI> every year from tho&s;e Co|lonies,
than is brought from the <HI>Spani&s;h We&s;t
Indies</HI> to <HI>Old Spain,</HI> notwith&s;tanding the extent
<PB N="391" REF="412">
of their dominion is above twenty times as
much; and notwith&s;tanding the va&s;t quantity
of gold and &s;ilver which they bring from the
mines of <HI>Mexico,</HI> and the mountains of <HI>Poto&s;i.</HI></P>
<P>WHETHER the&s;e people &s;ay true or no, is not
my bu&s;ine&s;s to enquire here; tho' if I may give
my opinion, I mu&s;t acknowledge that I believe
they do; but be it &s;o or not, 'tis certain that it
is an infinitely extended trade, and daily en|crea&s;ing;
and much of it, if not all, is and
ought to be e&s;teemed as an Inland trade, becau&s;e,
as above, it is a circulation among our &s;elves.</P>
<P>As the manufactures of <HI>England,</HI> particularly
tho&s;e of <HI>Wool,</HI> (Cotton Wool included} and of
<HI>Silk,</HI> are the greate&s;t, and amount to the great|e&s;t
value of any &s;ingle manufacture in <HI>Europe,</HI>
&s;o they not only employ more people, but
tho&s;e people gain the mo&s;t money, that is
to &s;ay, have the be&s;t wages for their work,
of any people in the world; and yet, which is
a peculiar to <HI>England,</HI> the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> manufactures
are, allowing for their goodne&s;s, the cheape&s;t
at market of any in the world too; even <HI>France</HI>
it&s;elf, after all the pains they are at to get our
<HI>Wool,</HI> and all the expence they have been at to
imitate our manufactures, by getting over our
workmen, and giving them even greater wages
than they had here, have yet made &s;o little
proficiency in it, and are &s;o far from out-&s;el|ling
us in foreign markets, that they &s;till, in
&s;pight of the &s;tricte&s;t prohibitions, &s;end hither,
and to <HI>Holland</HI> and <HI>Germany,</HI> for <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Broad-cloths,
Druggets, Duroys, Flannels, Sayes, and &s;eve|ral
other &s;orts of our goods, to &s;upply their own.
<PB N="392" REF="413">
Nor can they cloath them&s;elves to their &s;atisfac|tion
with their own goods; but if any <HI>French</HI>
Gentleman of quality comes over hither from
<HI>France,</HI> he is &s;ure to bring no more coats with
him than backs, but immediately to make him
new cloaths as &s;oon as he arrives, and to carry
as many new &s;uits home with him at his return,
as he can get leave to bring a&s;hore when he
comes there; a demon&s;tration that our manu|facture
exceeds theirs, after all their boa&s;ts of
it, both in goodne&s;s and in cheapne&s;s, even by
their own confe&s;&s;ion: but I am not now to en|ter
upon the particular manufactures, but the
general trade in the manufacture; this particular
being a trade of &s;uch a magnitude, it is to be
ob&s;erved for our purpo&s;e, that the greatne&s;s of
it con&s;i&s;ts of two parts:</P>
<Q><LIST>
<ITEM>1. THE con&s;umption of it at home, including
our own Plantations and Factories.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. THE exportation of it to foreign parts,
exclu&s;ive of the &s;aid Plantations and Fac|tories.</ITEM>
</LIST></Q>
<P>IT is the fir&s;t of the&s;e which is the &s;ubject of
my pre&s;ent di&s;cour&s;e, becau&s;e the Trade&s;men to
whom, and for who&s;e in&s;truction the&s;e letters
are de&s;ign'd, are the people principally concern|ed
in the making all the&s;e manufactures, and
wholly and &s;olely concerned in di&s;per&s;ing and
circulating them for the home con&s;umption;
and this, with &s;ome additions, as explained a|bove,
I call <HI>Inland Trade.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="393" REF="414">
THE home con&s;umption of our own goods,
as it is very great, &s;o it has one particular cir|cum&s;tance
attending it, which exceedingly en|crea&s;es
it as a trade, and that is, that be&s;ides
the numbers of people which it employs in the
rai&s;ing the materials, and making the goods
them&s;elves as a manufacture; I &s;ay, be&s;ides all
this, there are multitudes of people employ'd,
cattle maintain'd, with waggons and carts for
the &s;ervice on &s;hore, barges and boats for car|riage
in the rivers, and &s;hips and barks for car|rying
by &s;ea, and all for the circulating the&s;e
manufactures from one place to another, for the
con&s;umption of them among the people.</P>
<P>SO that in &s;hort, the circulation of the goods
is a bu&s;ine&s;s not equal indeed, but bearing a very
great proportion to the Trade it &s;elf.</P>
<P>THIS is owing to another particular circum|&s;tance
of our manufacture, and perhaps is not
&s;o remarkably the ca&s;e of any other manufac|ture
or country in <HI>Europe,</HI> namely, that tho' all
our manufactures are u&s;ed and called for by al|mo&s;t
all the people, and that in every part of
the whole <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> dominion; yet they are made

Counties in <HI>Britain,</HI> and &s;ome of them

any two manufactures being made in one

<P>THE <HI>Narrow Cloths</HI> in <HI>York&s;hire</HI> and <HI>Stafford|&s;hire.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="394" REF="415">
THE <HI>Ker&s;eys, Cottons, Half-Thicks, Duf|fields,

<P>THE <HI>Tammeys</HI> at <HI>Coventry,</HI> and the like.</P></Q>
<P>IT is the &s;ame, in &s;ome re&s;pects, with our
provi&s;ions, e&s;pecially for the &s;upply of the city
of <HI>London,</HI> and al&s;o of &s;everal other parts; for
example,</P>
<P>WHEN I &s;peak of provi&s;ions, I mean &s;uch as
is not made u&s;e of in the county where it is
made and produc'd; for example,</P>
<Q><P><HI>Butter</HI> in &s;irkins in <HI>Suffolk</HI> and <HI>York&s;hire.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Chee&s;e</HI> from <HI>Che&s;hire, Wilt&s;hire, Warwick|&s;hire,</HI>

<P><HI>Herrings</HI> cur'd Red from <HI>Yarmouth</HI> in <HI>Nor|folk.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Coals</HI> for fewel from <HI>Northumberland</HI> and
<HI>Durham.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Malt</HI> from the counties of <HI>Hertford, E&s;&s;ex,
Kent, Bucks, Oxford, Berks, &amp;c.</HI></P></Q>
<P>AND thus of many other things which are
the proper produce of one part of the country
only, but are from thence di&s;pers'd for the or|dinary
u&s;e of the people into many, or perhaps
<PB N="395" REF="416">
into all the other counties of <HI>England,</HI> to the
infinite advantage of our inland-commerce, and
employing a va&s;t number of people and cattle;
and con&s;equently tho&s;e people and cattle en|crea&s;ing
the con&s;umption of provi&s;ions and fo|rage,
and the improvement of lands; &s;o true it
is, and &s;o vi&s;ible, that trade encrea&s;es people,
and people encrea&s;e trade.</P>
<P>THIS carriage of goods in <HI>England</HI> from tho&s;e
places is chiefly manag'd by hor&s;es and waggons;
the number of which is not to be gue&s;s'd at,
nor is there any rule or art that can be thought
of, by which any ju&s;t calculation can be made
of it, and therefore I &s;hall not enter upon any
particular of it at this time; it is &s;ufficient to
&s;ay what I believe to be true, <HI>viz.</HI> that it is
equal to the whole trade of &s;ome nations, and
the rather, becau&s;e of the great improvement
of land, which proceeds from the employing &s;o
many thousands of hor&s;es, as are furni&s;h'd for
this part of bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>IN other countries, and indeed in mo&s;t coun|tries
in <HI>Europe,</HI> all their inland-trade, &s;uch as it
is, is carried on by the convenience of naviga|tion,
either by coa&s;tings on the &s;ea, or by river-navigation:
It is true, our coa&s;ting trade is ex|ceeding
great, and employs a prodigious num|ber
of &s;hips, as well from all the &s;hores of <HI>Eng|land</HI>
to <HI>London,</HI> as from one Port to another.</P>
<P>BUT as to our river-navigation, it is not e|qual
to it, tho' in &s;ome places it is very great
too; but we have but a very few navigable ri|vers
in <HI>England,</HI> compar'd with tho&s;e of other
countries; nor are many of tho&s;e rivers we have
<PB N="396" REF="417">
navigable to any con&s;iderable length from the
&s;ea; the mo&s;t con&s;iderable rivers in <HI>England</HI>
for navigation are as follow:
<LIST>
<ITEM>The <HI>Thames.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>The <HI>Trent.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>The <HI>Severn.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>The <HI>Wye.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>The <HI>Ou&s;e.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>The <HI>Humber.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>The <HI>Air,</HI> and</ITEM>
<ITEM>The <HI>Calder.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST>
<Q>[The&s;e are navigable a con&s;iderable way, and
receive &s;everal other navigable rivers into
them; but except the&s;e there are very few
rivers in <HI>England</HI> which are navigable much
above the fir&s;t town of note within their
mouth.]</Q></P>
<P>MOST of our other greate&s;t and mo&s;t naviga|ble
rivers are navigable but a very little way in;
as the Northern <HI>Ou&s;e</HI> but to <HI>York,</HI> the <HI>Orwell</HI>
but to <HI>Ip&s;wich,</HI> the <HI>Yare</HI> but to <HI>Norwich;</HI> the
<HI>Tyne</HI> it&s;elf but a very little above <HI>Newca&s;tle,</HI>
not in all above twelve miles; the <HI>Tweed</HI> not
at all above <HI>Berwick;</HI> the Great <HI>Avon</HI> but to
<HI>Bri&s;tol;</HI> the <HI>Exe</HI> but to <HI>Exce&s;ter;</HI> and the <HI>Dee</HI>
but to <HI>Che&s;ter;</HI> in a word, our river-navigation
is not to be nam'd for carriage, with the va&s;t
bulk of carriage by pack-hor&s;es and by wag|gons;
nor mu&s;t the carriage by Pedlars on their
backs be omitted.</P>
<P>THIS carriage is the medium of our inland
trade, and, as I &s;aid, is a branch of the trade
it&s;elf: This great carriage is occa&s;ion'd by the
&s;ituation of our produce and manufactures; for
example,</P>
<Q><PB N="397" REF="418">
<P>THE <HI>Taunton</HI> and <HI>Exce&s;ter</HI> Serges, Perpetuana's,
and Dueroys come chiefly by land.</P>
<P>THE Clothing, &s;uch as the Broad-Cloth and
Druggets from <HI>Wilts, Glouce&s;ter, Worce&s;ter,</HI>
and <HI>Shrop&s;hire,</HI> comes all by land-carriage
to <HI>London,</HI> and goes down again by land-carriages
to all parts of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>THE <HI>York&s;hire</HI> Clothing trade, the <HI>Manche&s;ter</HI>
and <HI>Coventry</HI> trades, all by land, not to
<HI>London</HI> only, but to all parts of <HI>England,</HI>
by Hor&s;e-packs, the <HI>Manche&s;ter</HI> men being,
&s;aving their wealth, a kind of <HI>Pedlars,</HI>
who carry their goods them&s;elves to the
country &s;hop-keepers every where, as do
now the <HI>York&s;hire</HI> and <HI>Coventry</HI> manufa|cturers
al&s;o.</P></Q>
<P>NOW in all the&s;e manufactures, however re|mote
from one another, every town in <HI>Eng|land</HI>
u&s;es &s;omething, not only of one, or other,
but of all the re&s;t; every &s;ort of goods is want|ed
every where; and where they make one &s;ort
of goods, and &s;ell them all over <HI>England,</HI> they
at the &s;ame time want other goods from almo&s;t
every other part; for example,</P>
<P><HI>Norwich</HI> makes chiefly Woollen Stuffs and
Camblets, and the&s;e are &s;old all over <HI>England;</HI>
but then <HI>Norwich</HI> buys Broad-cloth from <HI>Wilts</HI>
and <HI>Worce&s;ter&s;hire,</HI> Serges and Sagathies from
<HI>Devon</HI> and <HI>Somer&s;et&s;hire,</HI> Narrow Cloth from
<HI>York&s;hire,</HI> Flannel from <HI>Wales,</HI> Coals from
<HI>Newca&s;tle,</HI> and the like; and &s;o it is, <HI>mutatis
mutandis,</HI> of mo&s;t of the other parts.</P>
<P><PB N="398" REF="419">
THE circulating of the&s;e goods, in this man|ner,
is the life of our inland-trade, and encrea|&s;es
the numbers of our people, by keeping them
employ'd at home, and indeed of late they are
prodigiou&s;ly multiplied; and they again encrea&s;e
our trade, as &s;hall be mentioned in its place.</P>
<P>As the demand for all &s;orts of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> goods is
thus great, and they are thus extended in every
part of the i&s;land, &s;o the trade&s;men are di&s;per&s;t
and &s;pread over every part al&s;o; <HI>that is to &s;ay,</HI>
in every town, great or little, we find &s;hop-keep|ers
whole&s;ale or retale, who are concern'd in
this circulation, and hand forward the goods
to the la&s;t Con&s;umer: From <HI>London</HI> the goods
go chiefly to the great Towns, and from tho&s;e
again to the &s;maller markets, and from tho&s;e to
the meane&s;t villages; &s;o that all the manufactures
of <HI>England,</HI> and mo&s;t of them al&s;o of foreign
countries, are to be found in the meane&s;t vil|lage,
and in the remote&s;t corner of the whole
i&s;land of <HI>Britain,</HI> and are to be bought, as it
were, at every body's door.</P>
<P>THIS &s;hews not the extent of our manufa|ctures
only, but the u&s;efulne&s;s of them, and how
they are &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to mankind, that our own
people cannot be without them, and every &s;ort
of them, and cannot make one thing &s;erve for
another; but as they &s;ell their own, &s;o they
buy from others, and <HI>every body</HI> here trades
with <HI>every body;</HI> this it is that gives the whole
manufacture &s;o univer&s;al a circulation, and makes
it &s;o immen&s;ely great in <HI>England:</HI> What it
is abroad is not &s;o much to our pre&s;ent pur|po&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="399" REF="420">
AGAIN, the magnitude of the city of <HI>London</HI>
adds very con&s;iderably to the greatne&s;s of the
inland-trade; for as this city is the center of our
trade, &s;o all the manufactures are brought hither,
and from hence circulated again to all the coun|try,
as they are particularly called for; but that
is not all; the magnitude of the city influences
the whole nation al&s;o in the article of provi&s;ions,
and &s;omething is rais'd in every county in <HI>Eng|land,</HI>
however remote, for the &s;upply of <HI>Lon|don;</HI>
nay, all the be&s;t of every produce is brought
hither; &s;o that all the people, and all the lands
in <HI>England,</HI> &s;eem to be at work for, or em|ploy'd
by, or on the account of this over-grown
city.</P>
<P>THIS makes the trade encrea&s;e prodigiou&s;ly,
even as the city it&s;elf encrea&s;es; and we all
know the city is very greatly encrea&s;ed within
few years pa&s;t: Again, as the whole nation
is employ'd to feed and cloath this city, &s;o here
is the money, by which all the people in the
whole nation &s;eem to be &s;upported and main|tain'd.</P>
<P>I have endeavour'd to make &s;ome calculation
of the number of &s;hop-keepers in this kingdom,
but I find it is not to be done; we may as well
count the &s;tars; not that they are equal in num|ber
neither, but it is as impo&s;&s;ible, unle&s;s any
one per&s;on corre&s;ponded &s;o as to have them
numbred in every town, or pari&s;h, throughout
the kingdom; I doubt not they are &s;ome hun|dreds
of thou&s;ands, but there is no making an
e&s;timate; the number is in a manner infinite;
It is as impo&s;&s;ible likewi&s;e to make any gue&s;s
<PB N="400" REF="421">
at the bulk of their trade, and how much they
return yearly; nor, if we could, would it give
any foundation for any ju&s;t calculation of the
value of goods in general, becau&s;e all our goods
circulate &s;o much, and go &s;o often thro' &s;o ma|ny
hands before they come to the con&s;umer:
This &s;o often pa&s;&s;ing every &s;ort of goods thro'
&s;o many hands, before it comes into the hands
of the la&s;t con&s;umer, is that which makes our
trade be &s;o immen&s;ely great; for example, if
there is made in <HI>England</HI> for our home-con|&s;umption
the value of one hundred thou&s;and
pounds worth of any particular goods, <HI>&s;ay for
example</HI> that it be &s;o many pieces of Serge or
Cloth, and if this goes through ten trade&s;mens
hands, before it comes to the la&s;t con&s;umer,
then there is ten hundred thou&s;and pounds re|turn'd
in trade for that one hundred thou&s;and
pounds worth of goods; and &s;o of all the &s;orts
of goods we trade in.</P>
<P>AGAIN, as I &s;aid above, all our manufactures
are &s;o u&s;eful to, and depend on one another &s;o
much in trade, that the &s;ale of one nece&s;&s;arily
cau&s;es the demand of the other, in all parts;
for example, &s;uppo&s;e the poore&s;t Country-man
wants to be cloathed, or &s;uppo&s;e it be a Gen|tleman
wants to cloath one of his &s;ervants,
whether a footman in a livery, or &s;uppo&s;e it be
any &s;ervant in ordinary apparel, yet he &s;hall in
&s;ome part employ almo&s;t every one of the ma|nufacturing
counties of <HI>England,</HI> for making
up one ordinary &s;uit of cloaths; for example,</P>
<Q><P>IF his Coat be of Woollen Cloth, he has
that from <HI>York&s;hire.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="401" REF="422">
THE Lining is Shalloon from <HI>Berk&s;hire.</HI></P>
<P>THE Wa&s;tcoat is of Callamancoe from <HI>Nor|wich.</HI></P>
<P>THE Breeches of a &s;trong Drugget from the
<HI>Devizes, Wilt&s;hire.</HI></P>
<P>THE Stockings being of Yarn from <HI>We&s;tmore|land.</HI></P>
<P>THE Hat is a Felt from <HI>Leice&s;ter.</HI></P>
<P>THE Gloves of Leather from <HI>Somer&s;et&s;hie.</HI></P>
<P>THE Shoes from <HI>Northampton.</HI></P>
<P>THE Buttons from <HI>Macclesfield</HI> in <HI>Che&s;hire;</HI>

<P>HIS Garters from <HI>Manche&s;ter.</HI></P>
<P>HIS &s;hirt of home-made Linen of <HI>Lanca&s;hire,</HI>

<P>IF it be thus of every poor man's cloathing,
or of a &s;ervant, what mu&s;t it be of the ma&s;ter,
and of the re&s;t of the family? and in this par|ticular
the ca&s;e is the &s;ame, let the family live
where they will; &s;o that all the&s;e manufactures
mu&s;t be found in all the remote&s;t towns and
counties in <HI>England,</HI> be it where you will.</P>
<P>AGAIN, take the furni&s;hing of our hou&s;es, it
is the &s;ame in proportion, and according to
the figure and quality of the per&s;on; &s;uppo&s;e
then it be a middling trade&s;man, that is going
to live in &s;ome market-town, and to open his
&s;hop there; &s;uppo&s;e him not to deal in the ma|nufacture,
but in Grocery, and &s;uch &s;ort of wares
as the Country-Grocers &s;ell.</P>

<P>FOR his cloathing of him&s;elf, for we mu&s;t al|low

finer than the poor man above, and &s;o his

<P>I give this li&s;t to explain what I &s;aid before;
namely, that there is no particular place in <HI>Eng|land,</HI>
where all the manufactures are made, but
<PB N="405" REF="426">
every county or place has its peculiar &s;ort, or
particular manufacture, in which the people are
wholly employ'd; and for all the re&s;t that is
wanted, they fetch them from other parts.</P>
<P>BUT then, as what is thus wanted by every
particular per&s;on, or family, is but in &s;mall
quantities, and they would not be able to &s;end
for it to the country, or town, where it is to be
bought; there are &s;hop-keepers in every village,
or at lea&s;t in every con&s;iderable market-town,
where the particulars are to be bought; and
who find it worth their while to furni&s;h them|&s;elves
with Quantities of all the particular goods,
be they made where and as far off as they will;
and at the&s;e &s;hops the people, who want them,
are ea&s;ily &s;upplied.</P>
<P>NOR do even the&s;e &s;hop-keepers go or &s;end
to all the &s;everal countries, where tho&s;e goods
are made, that is to &s;ay, to this part for the
<HI>Cloth,</HI> or to that for the <HI>Lining;</HI> to another
for the <HI>Buttons,</HI> and to another for the <HI>Thread;</HI>
but they again corre&s;pond with the whole&s;ale-dealers
in <HI>London,</HI> where there are particular
&s;hops or warehou&s;es for all the&s;e; and they not
only furni&s;h the country &s;hop-keepers, but give
them large credit, and &s;ell them great quantities
of goods, by which they again are enabled to
tru&s;t the Taylors, who make the cloaths, or e|ven
their neighbours, who wear them; and the
Manufacturers in the &s;everal counties do the
like by tho&s;e Whole&s;ale dealers, who &s;upply the
country &s;hops.</P>
<P>THRO' &s;o many hands do all the nece&s;&s;ary
things pa&s;s for the cloathing a poor plain coun|try-man,
<PB N="406" REF="427">
tho' he liv'd as far as <HI>Berwick</HI> upon
<HI>Tweed;</HI> and this occa&s;ions, as I have &s;aid, a ge|neral
circulation of trade, both to and from
<HI>London,</HI> from and to all the parts of <HI>England,</HI>
&s;o that every manufacture is &s;old and remov'd
five or &s;ix times, and <HI>perhaps more,</HI> before it
comes to the la&s;t con&s;umer.</P>
<P>THIS method of trade brings another arti|cle
in, which al&s;o is the great foundation of
the encrea&s;e of Commerce; and the prodigious
magnitude of our Inland-trade is much owing
to it, and that is giving credit, by which every
trade&s;man is enabled to trade for a great deal
more than he otherwi&s;e could do. By this
method a &s;hop-keeper is able to &s;tock his &s;hop,
or warehou&s;es, with two or three times as much
goods in value, as he has &s;tock of his own to
begin the world with; and by that means is a|ble
to tru&s;t out his goods to others, and give
them time, and &s;o under one another; nay, I
may &s;ay, many a trade&s;man begins the world
with borrow'd &s;tocks, or with no &s;tock at all,
but that of Credit, and yet carries on a trade
for &s;everal hundreds, nay, for &s;everal thou&s;ands
of pounds a year.</P>
<P>BY this means the trade in general is infi|nitely
encrea&s;ed; nay, the &s;tock of the king|dom
in trade is doubled, or trebled, or more;
and there is infinitely more bu&s;ine&s;s carried
on, than the real &s;tock could be able to ma|nage,
if no credit was to be given; for cre|dit
in this particular is a &s;tock, and that not an
imaginary, but a real &s;tock; for the trade&s;man,
that perhaps begins but with five hundred, or one
<PB N="407" REF="428">
thou&s;and pounds &s;tock, &s;hall be able to furni&s;h
or &s;tock his &s;hop with four times the &s;um in
the value of goods; and as he gives credit a|gain,
and tru&s;ts other trade&s;men under him, &s;o
he launches out into a trade of a great magni|tude;
and yet if he is a prudent manager of
his bu&s;ine&s;s, he finds him&s;elf able to an&s;wer his
payments, and &s;o continually &s;upply him&s;elf
with goods, keeping up the reputation of his
dealings, and the credit of his &s;hop, tho' his
&s;tock be not a fifth, nay, &s;ometimes not a tenth
part, in proportion to the returns that he makes
by the year; &s;o that credit is the foundation,
on which the trade of <HI>England</HI> is made &s;o con|&s;iderable.</P>
<P>NOR is it enough to &s;ay, that people mu&s;t
and will have goods, and that the con&s;ump|tion
is the &s;ame; it is evident, that con&s;ump|tion
is not the &s;ame; and in tho&s;e nations
where they give no credit, or not &s;o much as
here, the trade is &s;mall in proportion, as I &s;hall
&s;hew in its place.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of Credit in Trade, and how a Trade&s;|man
ought to value and improve it:
How ea&s;ily lo&s;t, and how hard it is to
be recover'd.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_CREDIT is, or ought to be the trade&s;|man's
<HI>Mi&s;tre&s;s;</HI> but I mu&s;t tell him
too, he mu&s;t not think of ever ca&s;t|ing
her off; for if once he lo&s;es her,
&s;he hardly ever returns; and yet &s;he has one qua|lity,
in which &s;he differs from mo&s;t of the La|dies,
which go by that name; if you court her,
&s;he is gone, if you manage &s;o wi&s;ely, as to
make her believe you really do not want her,
&s;he follows and courts you: But by the way no
Trade&s;man can be in &s;o good circum&s;tances, as
to &s;ay he does not want, that is, does not &s;tand
in need of credit.</P>
<P>CREDIT, next to real &s;tock, is the foundation,
the life and &s;oul of bu&s;ine&s;s in a private trade&s;|man;
it is his pro&s;perity; 'tis his &s;upport in
the &s;ub&s;tance of his whole trade; even in pub|lick
matters 'tis the &s;trength and fund of a na|tion:
we felt in the late wars the con&s;equence
<PB N="409" REF="430">
of both the extremes, <HI>viz.</HI> of wanting and of
enjoying a compleat fund of credit.</P>
<P>CREDIT makes war, and makes peace; rai&s;es
armies, fits out navies, fights battles, be&s;ieges
towns; and, in a word, it is more ju&s;tly call'd
the &s;inews of war, than the money it&s;elf; be|cau&s;e
it can do all the&s;e things without money;
nay, it will bring in money to be &s;ub&s;ervient,
tho' it be independent.</P>
<P>CREDIT makes the &s;oldier fight without pay,
the armies march without provi&s;ions, and it
makes trade&s;men keep open &s;hop without &s;tock;
the force of credit is not to be de&s;crib'd by
words; it is an impregnable fortification, either
for a nation, or for a &s;ingle man in bu&s;ine&s;s;
and he that has credit is invulnerable, whether
he has money, or no: Nay, it will make mo|ney,
and, which is yet more, it will make mo|ney
without an intrin&s;ick, without the <HI>materia
medica,</HI> (as the Doctors have it;) it adds a va|lue,
and &s;upports whatever value it adds, to the
meane&s;t &s;ub&s;tance; it makes paper pa&s;s for mo|ney,
and fills the Exchequer and the Banks with
as many millions as it plea&s;es, upon demand.</P>
<P>AS I &s;aid in my la&s;t, it encrea&s;es commerce,
&s;o I may add, it makes trade and makes the
whole kingdom trade for many millions more,
than the national &s;pecies can amount to.</P>
<P>IT may be true, as &s;ome alledge, that we can|not
drive a trade for more goods than we have
to trade, with; but then 'tis as true, that it
is by the help of credit that we can encrea&s;e the
quantity, and that more goods are made to trade
with, than would otherwi&s;e be; more goods
<PB N="410" REF="431">
are brought to market, than they could otherwi&s;e
&s;ell; and even in the la&s;t con&s;umption how ma|ny
thou&s;ands of families wear out their cloaths
before they pay for them, and eat their dinner
upon tick with the Butcher? nay, how many thou|&s;ands,
who could not buy any cloaths, if they
were to pay for them in ready money, yet buy
them at a venture upon their credit, and pay
for them, as they can?</P>
<P>Trade is anticipated by Credit, and it grows by
the anticipation; for men often buy cloaths before
they pay for them, becau&s;e they want cloaths before
they can &s;pare the money; and the&s;e are
to many in number, that really they add a great
&s;troke to the bulk of our Inland trade: How
many families have we in <HI>England</HI> that live up|on
credit, even to the tune of two or three years
rent of their revenue, before it comes in? &s;o
that they may be &s;aid to <HI>eat the Calf in the
Cow's belly:</HI> This encroachment they make up|on
the &s;tock in trade; and even this very article
may &s;tate the ca&s;e: I doubt not but at this time
the land owes to the trade &s;ome millions &s;ter|ling;
that is to &s;ay, the Gentlemen owe to the
Trade&s;men &s;o much money, which at long run
the rents of their lands mu&s;t pay.</P>
<P>The Trade&s;men having then tru&s;ted the land|ed
men with &s;o much, where mu&s;t they have it
but by giving credit al&s;o to one another? tru&s;ting
their goods and money into trade, one launch|ing
out into the hands of another, and forbear|ing
payment 'till the lands make it good out of
their produce, that is to &s;ay, out of their Rents.</P>
<P><PB N="411" REF="432">
THE Trade is not limited; the produce of
lands may and is re&s;train'd; Trade cannot exceed
the bounds of the goods it can &s;ell; but while
trade can encrea&s;e its &s;tock of ca&s;h by credit, it
can encrea&s;e its &s;tock of goods for &s;ale, and
then it has nothing to do, but to find a market
to &s;ell at; and this we have done in all parts
of the world, &s;till by the force of our &s;tocks be|ing
&s;o encreas'd.</P>
<P>THUS Credit rai&s;ing &s;tock at home, that &s;tock
enables us to give credit abroad; and thus the
quantity of goods, which we make, and which
is infinitely encrea&s;ed at home, enables us to
find or force a vent abroad: This is apparent,
our home trade having &s;o far encreas'd our ma|nufacture,
that <HI>England</HI> may be &s;aid to be able
almo&s;t to clothe the whole world; and in our
carrying on the foreign trade wholly upon the
<HI>Engli&s;h</HI> &s;tocks, giving credit to almo&s;t all the
nations of the world; for 'tis evident, our &s;tocks
lie at this time upon credit in the warehou&s;es
of the merchants in <HI>Spain</HI> and <HI>Portugal, Hol|land</HI>
and <HI>Germany, Italy</HI> and <HI>Turky;</HI> nay, in
<HI>New Spain</HI> and <HI>Bra&s;il.</HI></P>
<P>THE exceeding quantity of goods thus rais'd
in <HI>England</HI> cannot be &s;uppos'd to be the mere
product of the &s;olid wealth and &s;tocks of the
<HI>Engli&s;h</HI> people; we do not pretend to it; the
joining tho&s;e &s;tocks to the value of goods always
appearing in <HI>England,</HI> in the hands of the manu|cturers,
trade&s;men, and merchants, and to the
wealth which appears in &s;hipping, in &s;tock upon
land, and in the current coin of the nation,
would amount to &s;uch a prodigy of &s;tock, as
not all <HI>Europe</HI> could pretend to.</P>
<P><PB N="412" REF="433">
BUT all this is owing to the prodigious thing
call'd Credit, the extent of which in the <HI>Bri|ti&s;h</HI>
trade is as hard to be valued, as the benefit
of it to <HI>England</HI> is really not to be de&s;cribed.
It mu&s;t be likewi&s;e &s;aid, to the honour of our
<HI>Engli&s;h</HI> trade&s;men, that they under&s;tand how to
manage the credit they both give and take, bet|ter
than any other trade&s;men in the world; in|deed
they have a greater opportunity to im|prove
it, and make u&s;e of it, and therefore may
be &s;uppo&s;ed to be more ready in making the
be&s;t of their credit, than any other Nations are.</P>
<P>HENCE it is that we frequently find Trade&s;men
carrying on a prodigious trade with but a mid|dling
&s;tock of their own, the re&s;t being all ma|naged
by the force of their credit, for example,
I have known a man in a private warehou&s;e in
<HI>London</HI> trade for forty thou&s;and pounds a year
&s;terling, and carry on &s;uch a return for many
years together, and not have one thou&s;and
pound &s;tock of his own, or not more; all the
re&s;t has been carried on upon credit, being the
&s;tocks of other men running continually thro'
his hands: And this is not practi&s;ed now and
then, as a great rarity, but is very frequent in
trade, and may be &s;een every day, as what in
its degree runs thro' the whole body of the
trade&s;men in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>EVERY trade&s;man both gives and takes credit,
and the new mode of &s;etting it up over their
&s;hop and warehou&s;e doors, in capital letters,
<HI>NO TRUST BY RETAIL,</HI> is a pre|&s;umption
in trade; and tho' it may have been
attempted in &s;ome trades, was never yet brought to
<PB N="413" REF="434">
any perfection; and mo&s;t of tho&s;e trades, who
were the forwarde&s;t to &s;et it up, have been ob|liged
to take it down again, or act contrary to
it in their bu&s;ine&s;s; Or &s;ee &s;ome very good cu&s;|tomers
go away from them to other &s;hops, who
tho' they have not brought money with them,
have yet good foundations to make any trade&s;|men
tru&s;t them, and who do at proper times
make payments punctual enough.</P>
<P>ON the contrary, in&s;tead of giving no tru&s;t
by retail, we &s;ee very con&s;iderable families who
buy nothing but on tru&s;t; even Bread, Beer,
Butter, Chee&s;e, Beef and Mutton, Wine, Gro|cery,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> being the things which even with the
meane&s;t families are generally &s;old for ready
money. Thus I have known a family, who&s;e re|venue
has been &s;ome thou&s;ands a year, pay
their Butcher, and Baker, and Grocer, and
Chee&s;emonger, by a hundred pounds at a time,
and be generally a hundred more in each of their
debts, and yet the Trade&s;men have thought
it well worth while to tru&s;t them, and their
pay has in the end been very hone&s;t and good.</P>
<P>THIS is what I &s;ay brings Land &s;o much in
debt to Trade, and obliges the trade&s;men to take
credit of one another; and yet they do not lo&s;e
by it neither, for the trade&s;men find it in the price,
and they take care to make &s;uch families pay
warmly for the credit, in the rate of their goods;
nor can it be expected it &s;hould be otherwi&s;e,
for unle&s;s the profit an&s;wered it, the trade&s;man
could not afford to be &s;o long without his
money.</P>
<P><PB N="414" REF="435">
THIS credit takes its beginning in our manu|factures,
even at the very fir&s;t of the opera|tion,
for the ma&s;ter manufacturer him&s;elf be|gins
it; Take a country Clothier, or Bay-maker,
or what other maker of goods you plea&s;e, pro|vided
he be one that puts out the goods to
the making; it is true that the poor &s;pinners
and weavers cannot tru&s;t; the fir&s;t &s;pin for their
Bread, and the la&s;t not only weave for their
Bread, but they have &s;everal workmen and
boys under them, who are very poor, and if
they &s;hould want their pay on <HI>Saturday</HI> night,
mu&s;t want their dinner a <HI>Sunday;</HI> and perhaps
would be in danger of &s;tarving, with their fa|milies,
by the next <HI>Saturday.</HI></P>
<P>BUT tho' the Clothier cannot have credit for
&s;pinning and weaving, he buys his Wooll at the
Staplers or Fellmongers, and he gets two or
three months credit for that; he buys his oil
and &s;oap of the country &s;hop-keeper, or has it
&s;ent down from his Factor at <HI>London,</HI> and he
gets longer credit for that, and the like of all
other things; &s;o that a Clothier of any con&s;i|derable
bu&s;ine&s;s, when he comes to die, &s;hall
appear to be four or five thou&s;and pounds in debt.</P>
<P>BUT then look into his books, and you &s;hall find
his Factor at <HI>Blackwel-hall,</HI> who &s;ells his Cloths,
or the Warehou&s;e-keeper who &s;ells his <HI>Dueroys</HI>
and <HI>Druggets,</HI> or both together, have two thou|&s;and
pounds worth of goods in hand left un|&s;old;
and has tru&s;ted out to Drapers and Mer|cers,
and Merchants, to the value of four thou|&s;and
pounds more; and look into his work|hou&s;e
at home, <HI>viz.</HI> his wool-lofts, his comb|ing-&s;hop,
<PB N="415" REF="436">
his yarn-chamber, and the like, and
there you will find it; in wooll un&s;pun, and in
yarn &s;pun, and in wooll at the &s;pinners, and in
yarn at and in the looms at the weavers; in
Rape-oil, <HI>Gallipoli</HI>-oil, and perhaps &s;oap, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> in
his ware-hou&s;es, and in cloths at the fulling-mill,
and in his rowing-&s;hops, fini&s;hed and unfini&s;h|ed,
four thou&s;and pounds worth of goods more;
&s;o that tho' this Clothier ow'd five thou&s;and
pounds at his death, he has neverthele&s;s died in
good circum&s;tances, and has five thou&s;and pounds
e&s;tate clear to go among his children, all his
debts paid and di&s;charged: However, 'tis evi|dent,
that at the very beginning of this ma|nufacturer's
trade, his five thou&s;and pounds &s;tock
is made ten thou&s;and, by the help of his Credit,
and he trades for three times as much in the
year; &s;o that five thou&s;and pound &s;tock makes
ten thou&s;and pound &s;tock and credit, and that
together makes thirty thou&s;and pounds a year
return'd in trade.</P>
<P>WHEN you come from him to the warehou&s;e-keeper
in <HI>London,</HI> there you double and treble
upon it; to an unknown degree; for the <HI>London</HI>
Whole&s;ale-man &s;hall at his death appear to have
credit among the country Clothiers, for ten or
fifteen thou&s;and, nay, to twenty thou&s;and pounds,
and yet have kept up an un&s;potted credit all his
days.</P>
<P>WHEN he is dead, and his Executors or Wi|dow
comes to look into things, they are fright|ed
with the very appearance of &s;uch a weight
of debts, and begin to doubt how his e&s;tate
will come out at the end of it: But when they
<PB N="416" REF="437">
come to ca&s;t up his books and his warehou&s;e,
they find
<Q><P>IN debts abroad perhaps thirty thou&s;and
pounds.</P>
<P>IN goods in his warehou&s;e, twelve thou&s;and
pounds;</P></Q>
So that in a word, the man has died immen&s;ly
rich; that is to &s;ay, worth between twenty and
thirty thou&s;and pounds, only that having been
a long &s;tandard in trade, and having a large
&s;tock, he drove a very great bu&s;ine&s;s, perhaps
to the tune of &s;ixty to &s;eventy thou&s;and pounds
a year; &s;o that of all the thirty thou&s;and
pounds owing, there may be very little of it
deliver'd above four to &s;ix months, and the
debtors being many of them con&s;iderable mer|chants,
and good payma&s;ters, there is no diffi|culty
in getting in money enough to clear all
his own debts; and the widow and children being
left well, are not in &s;uch ha&s;te for the re&s;t, but
that it comes in time enough to make them
ea&s;y; and at length it all comes in, or with but
a little lo&s;s.</P>
<P>As it is thus in great things, 'tis the &s;ame in
proportion with &s;mall; &s;o that in all the trade
of <HI>England,</HI> you may reckon two thirds of it
carried on upon credit; in which reckoning I
&s;uppo&s;e I &s;peak much within compa&s;s, for in
&s;ome trades there is four parts of five carried
on &s;o; and in &s;ome more.</P>
<P>ALL the&s;e things &s;erve to &s;hew the infinite
value of which credit is to the trade&s;man, as
well as to trade it &s;elf; and 'tis for this rea|&s;on
<PB N="417" REF="438">
I have clo&s;ed my in&s;tructions with this part
of the di&s;cour&s;e: Credit is the choice&s;t jewel the
trade&s;man is tru&s;ted with, 'tis better than money
many ways; if a man has ten thou&s;and pounds
in money, he may certainly trade for ten thou|&s;and
pounds, and if he has no credit he cannot
trade for a &s;hilling more.</P>
<P>But how often have we &s;een men, by the meer
&s;trength of their credit, trade for ten thou&s;and
pounds a year, and have not one groat of real
&s;tock of their own left in the world; nay, I
can &s;ay it of my own knowledge, that I have
known a trade&s;man trade for ten thou&s;and
pounds a year, and carry it on with full credit
to the la&s;t ga&s;p, then die and break both at
once; that is to &s;ay, die un&s;u&s;pected, and yet
when his e&s;tate has been ca&s;t up, appear to be
five thou&s;and pounds wor&s;e than nothing in the
world: how he kept up his credit, and made
good his payments &s;o long, is indeed the my&s;|tery,
and makes good what I &s;aid before, name|ly,
that as none trade &s;o much upon credit in
the world, &s;o none know &s;o well how to im|prove
and manage credit to their real advan|tage,
as the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> trade&s;men do; and we have
many examples of it, among our Bankers e&s;pe|cially,
of when I have not room to enter at
this time into the di&s;cour&s;e, tho' it would afford
a great many diverting particulars.</P>
<P>I have mentioned on &s;everal occa&s;ions in the&s;e
letters, how nice and how dainty a dame this
Credit is, how &s;oon &s;he is affronted and di&s;ob|liged,
and how hard to be recovered, when once
di&s;ta&s;ted and fled; particularly in the &s;tory
<PB N="418" REF="439">
of the trade&s;man who told his friends in a pub|lick
coffee-hou&s;e that he was broke, and &s;hould
&s;hut up his &s;hop the next day: I have hinted
how chary we ought to be of one another's
credit, and that we &s;hould take care as much
of our neighbour trade&s;man's credit as we would
of his life, or as we would of firing his hou&s;e;
and con&s;equently the whole &s;treet.</P>
<P>LET me clo&s;e all with a word to the trade&s;|man
him&s;elf, that if it be &s;o valuable to him,
and his friends &s;hould be all &s;o chary of in|juring
his reputation, certainly he &s;hould be ve|ry
chary of it him&s;elf: The trade&s;man that is
not as tender of his credit as he is of his eyes,
or of his wife and children, neither de&s;erves cre|dit,
or will long be ma&s;ter of it.</P>
<P>AS Credit is a coy mi&s;tre&s;s, and will not ea&s;ily
be courted, &s;o &s;he is a mighty nice touchy La|dy,
and is &s;oon affronted; if &s;he is ill u&s;ed &s;he
flies at once, and 'tis a very doubtful thing whe|ther
ever you gain her favour again.</P>
<P>SOME may ask me here, How comes it to
pa&s;s, &s;ince &s;he is &s;o nice and touchy a Lady,
that &s;o many clowns court and carry her, and
&s;o many fools keep her &s;o long? My an&s;wer is&punc;
that tho&s;e clowns have yet good breeding enough
to treat her civilly; he mu&s;t be a fool indeed
that will give way to have his credit injur'd,
and &s;it &s;till and be quiet; that will not bu&s;tle
and u&s;e his utmo&s;t indu&s;try to vindicate his
own reputation, and pre&s;erve his credit.</P>
<P>BUT the main que&s;tion for a trade&s;man in
this ca&s;e, and which I have not &s;poken of yet,
is, What is the man to do to pre&s;erve his cre|dit?
<PB N="419" REF="440">
What are the methods that a young trade&s;|man
is to take, to gain a good &s;hare of credit
in his beginning, and to pre&s;erve and maintain
it when it is gain'd?</P>
<P>EVERY trade&s;man's credit is &s;uppos'd to be
good at fir&s;t; he that begins without credit, is
an unhappy wretch of a trade&s;man indeed, and
may be &s;aid to be broke even before he &s;ets
up; for what can a man do, who by any mi&s;|fortune
in his conduct during his apprentice&s;hip,
or by &s;ome ill character upon him &s;o early, be|gins
with a bla&s;t upon his credit? my advice to
&s;uch a young man would be, not to &s;et up at
all; or if he did, to &s;tay for &s;ome time, till by
&s;ome better behaviour, either as a journeyman,
or as an a&s;&s;i&s;tant in &s;ome other man's &s;hop or
warehou&s;e, he had recover'd him&s;elf; or el&s;e to
go and let up in &s;ome other place or town re|mote
from that where he has been bred; for
he mu&s;t have a great a&s;&s;urance that can flatter
him&s;elf to &s;et up, and believe he &s;hall recover
a lo&s;t reputation.</P>
<P>BUT take a young trade&s;man as &s;etting up
with the ordinary &s;tock, that is to &s;ay, a nega|tive
character, <HI>viz.</HI> that he has done nothing
to hurt his character, nothing to prejudice his
behaviour, and to give people a &s;u&s;picion of
him; what then is the fir&s;t principle on which
to build a trade&s;man's reputation? and what is
it he is to do?</P>
<P>THE an&s;wer is &s;hort, two things rai&s;e credit
in trade, and I may &s;ay they are the only things
requir'd; there are &s;ome nece&s;&s;ary addenda, but
the&s;e are the fundamentals.</P>

<P>I have dwelt upon the fir&s;t; the la&s;t I have
but a few words to &s;ay to, but they will be
very &s;ignificant; indeed that head requires no
comment, no explanations or enlargements
nothing can &s;upport <HI>Credit,</HI> be it publick or
private, but Hone&s;ty; a punctual dealing, a ge|neral
probity in every tran&s;action; he that once
<HI>breaks thro'</HI> his hone&s;ty, violates his credit; once
denominate a man <HI>a knave,</HI> and you need not
forbid any man to tru&s;t him.</P>
<P>EVEN in the publick it appears to be the
&s;ame thing; let any man view the publick cre|dit
in its pre&s;ent flouri&s;hing circum&s;tances, and
compare it with the latter end of the years of
King <HI>Charles</HI> II. after the <HI>Exchequer</HI> had been
&s;hut up, parliamentary appropriations mi&s;applied,
and, in a word, the publick faith broken; who
would lend? &s;even or eight <HI>per cent.</HI> was given
for anticipations in King <HI>William</HI>'s time, tho'
no new fraud had been offered, only becau&s;e
the old debts were unpaid; and how hard was
it to get any one to lend money at all?</P>
<P>BUT, after by a long &s;eries of ju&s;t and punc|tual
dealing, the Parliament making good all
the deficient funds, and paying even tho&s;e debts
for which no provi&s;ion was made, and the like,
how is the credit re&s;tor'd, the publick faith
made &s;acred again, and now money flows into
the <HI>Exchequer</HI> without calling for, and that at
3 or 4 <HI>per cent.</HI> intere&s;t, even from foreign
<PB N="421" REF="442">
countries, as well as from our own people?
They that have credit can never want mo|ney;
and this credit is to be rais'd by no other
method, whether by private trade&s;men, or pub|lick
bodies of men, by nations and governments,
but by a general probity and an hone&s;t punctual
dealing.</P>
<P>THE rea&s;on of this ca&s;e is as plain as the a&s;|&s;ertion;
the cau&s;e is in it &s;elf; no man lends
his money but with an expectation of receiving
it again with the intere&s;t: If the borrower pays
it punctually without he&s;itations and defalcati|ons,
without difficulties, and above all, without
compul&s;ion, what is the con&s;equence? he is
call'd an hone&s;t man, he has the reputation of a
punctual fair dealer: And what then? Why
then he may borrow again whenever he will,
he may take up money and goods, or any thing,
upon his bare word, or note; when another
man mu&s;t give bond&s;men, or <HI>mainprize,</HI> that
is, a pawn or pledge for &s;ecurity, and hardly
be tru&s;ted &s;o neither. <HI>This is credit.</HI></P>
<P>IT is not the quality of the per&s;on would
give credit to his dealing; not Kings, Princes,
Emperors, 'tis all one; nay, a private &s;hop|keeper
&s;hall borrow money much ea&s;ier than a
Prince, if the credit of the trade&s;man has the
reputation of being an hone&s;t man: Not the
crown it &s;elf can give credit to the head that
wears it, if once he that wears it comes but to
mortgage his honour in the matter of payment
of money.</P>
<P>WHO would have lent King <HI>Charles</HI> II. fifty
pounds on the credit of his word or bond, af|ter
<PB N="422" REF="443">
the &s;hutting up the <HI>Exchequer?</HI> The royal
word was made a je&s;t of, and the character of
the King was e&s;teem'd a fluttering trifle, which
no man would venture upon, much le&s;s ven|ture
his money upon.</P>
<P>IN King <HI>William</HI>'s time the ca&s;e was much
the &s;ame at fir&s;t; tho' the King had not broken
his credit then with any man, yet how did they
break their faith with the whole world, by the
deficiency of the funds, the giving high and
ruinous intere&s;t to men almo&s;t as greedy as
vulturs, the cau&s;ing the government to pay
great and extravagant rates for what they bought,
and great premio's for what they borrowed,
the&s;e were the injuries to the publick for want
of credit; nor was it in the power of the whole
nation to remedy it; on the contrary, they
made it &s;till grow wor&s;e and wor&s;e, till, as a|bove,
the Parliament recover'd it. And how
was it done? Not but by the &s;ame method a pri|vate
per&s;on mu&s;t do the &s;ame, <HI>viz.</HI> by doing
ju&s;tly, and fairly, and hone&s;tly by every body.</P>
<P>THUS credit began to revive, and to enlarge
it &s;elf again; and u&s;ury, which had as it were
eaten up mankind in bu&s;ine&s;s, declin'd, and &s;o
things came to their right way again.</P>
<P>THE ca&s;e is the &s;ame with a trade&s;man, if he
&s;huffles in payment, bargains at one time, and
pays at another, breaks his word and his ho|nour
in the road of his bu&s;ine&s;s, he is gone;
no man will take his bills, no man will tru&s;t
him.</P>
<P>THE conclu&s;ion is open and clear, the trade&s;|man
cannot be too careful of his credit, he
<PB N="423" REF="444">
cannot buy it too dear, or be too careful to
pre&s;erve it: it is in vain to maintain it by fal&s;e

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_AS I &s;aid that credit is maintained by ju&s;t
and honourable dealing, &s;o that ju&s;t
dealing depends very much upon the
trade&s;man's punctual payment of mo|ney
in all the &s;everal demands that are upon
him. The ordinary demands of money upon
a trade&s;man are,</P>
<Q><PB N="424" REF="445">
<LIST>
<ITEM>I. PROMISES of money for goods bought at
time.</ITEM>
<ITEM>II. BILLS drawn upon him; which, generally
&s;peaking, are from the country, that is to
&s;ay, from &s;ome places remote from where
he lives. Or,</ITEM>
<ITEM>III. PROMISSORY NOTES under his hand,
which are pa&s;s'd oftentimes upon buying
goods: bought al&s;o at time, as in the fir&s;t
head.</ITEM>
<ITEM>IV. BONDS bearing intere&s;t, given chiefly for
money borrowed at running intere&s;t.</ITEM>
</LIST></Q>
<P>1. PROMISES of money for goods bought at
time. This indeed is the loo&s;e&s;t article in a
trade&s;man's payments; and it is true that a
trade&s;man's credit is maintain'd upon the ea&s;ie&s;t
terms in this ca&s;e of any other that belongs
to trade; for in this ca&s;e not one man in twen|ty
keeps to his time; and &s;o ea&s;y are trade&s;|men
to one another, that in general it is not
much expected, but he that pays tolerably well,
and without <HI>dunning,</HI> is a good man, and in
credit; &s;hall be tru&s;ted any where, and keeps
up a character in his bu&s;ine&s;s; &s;ometimes he
pays &s;ooner, &s;ometimes later, and is accounted
&s;o good a cu&s;tomer, that tho' he owes a great
deal, yet he &s;hall be tru&s;ted any where, and is
as lofty and touchy if his credit be call'd in
que&s;tion, as if he paid all ready money.</P>
<P><PB N="425" REF="446">
AND indeed the&s;e men &s;hall often buy their
goods as cheap upon the credit of their ordi|nary
pay, as another man &s;hall that brings his
money in his hand; and it is rea&s;onable it &s;hould
be &s;o, for the <HI>ready-money man</HI> comes and buys
a parcel here, and a parcel there, and comes
but &s;eldom, but the Other comes every day,
that is to &s;ay, as often as he wants goods, buys
con&s;iderably, perhaps deals for two or three
thou&s;and pounds a year with you, <HI>and the like,</HI>
and pays currently too. Such a cu&s;tomer ought
indeed to be &s;old as cheap to, as the other
chance cu&s;tomer for his ready money. In this
manner of trade, <HI>I &s;ay,</HI> credit is maintain'd up|on
the ea&s;ie&s;t terms of any other, and yet here
the trade&s;man mu&s;t have a great care to keep it
up too; for tho' it be the ea&s;ie&s;t article to keep
up credit in, yet even in this article the Trade&s;|man
may lo&s;e his credit, and then he is un|done
at once; and this is by growing (what in
the language of Trade is call'd) <HI>long-winded,</HI>
putting off and putting off continually, till he
will bear <HI>dunning;</HI> then his credit falls, his
dealer that tru&s;ted him perhaps a thou&s;and pound
thick before, that e&s;teemed him as good as rea|dy
money, now grows &s;ick of him, declines
him, cares not whether he deals with him or
no, and at la&s;t refu&s;es to tru&s;t him any longer;
Then his credit is quite &s;unk and gone, and in
a little after that his trade is ruin'd and the
Trade&s;man too; for he mu&s;t be the D&mdash;of a
trade&s;man that can open his &s;hop after he has
outliv'd his credit; let him look which way he
will all is lo&s;t, no body cares to deal with him;
<PB N="426" REF="447">
and which is &s;till wor&s;e, no body will tru&s;t
him.</P>
<P>1. BILLS drawn upon him from the country;
that is to &s;ay, from &s;ome places remote from
where he now dwells; it is but a little while
ago &s;ince tho&s;e bills were the loo&s;e&s;t things in
trade, for as they could not be prote&s;ted, &s;o
they would not (in all their heats) always &s;ue for
them, but rather return them to the per&s;on
from whom they receiv'd them.</P>
<P>IN the mean time, let the occa&s;ion be what
it will, the trade&s;man ought on all occa&s;ions to
pay the&s;e notes without a publick recalling and
returning them, and without he&s;itation of any
kind what&s;oever. He that lets his bills lie long
unpaid, mu&s;t not expect to keep his credit much
after them.</P>
<P>BESIDES, the late law for noting and prote&s;t|ing
Inland bills alters the ca&s;e very much; Bills
now accepted are prote&s;ted in form, and if not
punctually paid are either return'd immediately,
or the per&s;on on whom they are drawn is liable
to be &s;ued at law; either of which is at be&s;t a
blow to the credit of the acceptor.</P>
<P>A trade&s;man may, without hurt to his repu|tation,
refu&s;e to accept a bill, for then, when
the notary comes he gives his rea&s;ons, <HI>viz.</HI>
that he refu&s;es to accept the bill for want of
advice, or for want of effects in his hands for
account of the drawer, or that he has not given
orders to draw upon him; in all which ca&s;es
the non-acceptance touches the credit of the
drawer; for in trade it is always e&s;teemed a di&s;|honourable
thing to draw upon any man that
<PB N="427" REF="448">
has not effects in his hands to an&s;wer the bill;
or to draw without order, or to draw and not
give advice of it; becau&s;e it looks like a for|wardne&s;s
to take the remitter's money without
giving him a &s;ufficient demand for it, where he
expects and ought to have it.</P>
<P>A trade&s;man comes to me in <HI>London,</HI> and
de&s;ires me to give him a bill payable at <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI>
for he is going to the Fair there, and being to
buy goods there, he wants money at <HI>Bri&s;tol</HI> to
pay for them; if I give him a bill, he pays
me down the money upon receipt of it, de|pending
upon my credit for the acceptance of
the bill. If I draw this bill where I have no
rea&s;on to draw it, where I have no demand, or
no effects to an&s;wer it, or if I give my corre|&s;pondent
no advice of it, I abu&s;e the remitter,
that is, the man who&s;e money I take, and this
reflects upon my credit that am the drawer,
and the next time this trade&s;man wants money
at <HI>Bri&s;tol</HI> fair, he will not come to me; no,
&s;ays he, his la&s;t bills were not accepted: Or if
he does come to me, then he demands that he
&s;hould not pay his money till he has advice
that my bills are accepted.</P>
<P>BUT on the other hand, if bills are right
drawn, and advice duly given, and the per&s;on
has effects in his hands, then if he refu&s;es the
bill, he &s;ays to the notary he does not accept
the bill, but gives no rea&s;on for it, only that
he &s;ays ab&s;olutely, I will not accept it, you
may take that for an an&s;wer; or he adds, I re|fu&s;e
to accept it for rea&s;ons be&s;t known to my
&s;elf; this is &s;ometimes done, but this does not
<PB N="428" REF="449">
leave the per&s;on's credit who refu&s;es, &s;o clear as
the other, tho' perhaps it may not &s;o directly
reflect upon him; but it leaves the ca&s;e a little
dubious and uncertain, and men will be apt to
write back to the per&s;on who &s;ent the bill to
enquire what the drawer &s;ays to it, and what
account he gives, or what character he has up|on
his tongue for the per&s;on drawn upon.</P>
<P>As the punctual paying bills when accepted,
is a main article in the credit of the Acceptor,
&s;o a trade&s;man &s;hould be very cautious in per|mitting
men to draw upon him where he has
not effects, or does not give order; for tho', as
I &s;aid, it ought not to affect his reputation not
to accept a bill where it ought not to be drawn,
yet a trade&s;man that is nice of his own cha|racter
does not love to be always or often re|fu&s;ing
to accept bills, or to have bills drawn up|on
him where he has no rea&s;on no accept them,
and therefore he will be very po&s;itive in for|bidding
&s;uch drawing; and if notwith&s;tanding
that, the importunities of the country trade&s;|man
obliges him to draw, the per&s;on drawn
upon will give &s;mart and rough an&s;wers to &s;uch
bills; as particularly, I refu&s;e to accept this bill
becau&s;e I have no effects of the drawers to an|&s;wer
it: Or thus, I refu&s;e to accept this bill,
becau&s;e I not only gave no orders to draw, but
gave po&s;itive orders not to draw: Or thus, I
will accept this bill, nor any other this
man &s;hall draw, and the like. This thoroughly
clears the credit of the acceptor, and reflects
gro&s;ly on the drawer.</P>
<P><PB N="429" REF="450">
AND yet, I &s;ay, even in this ca&s;e, a trade&s;|man
does not care to be drawn upon, and be
oblig'd to &s;ee bills pre&s;ented for acceptance,
and for payment, where he has given orders
not to draw, and where he has no effects to an|&s;wer.</P>
<P>IT is the great error of our country manu|facturers,
in many, if not in mo&s;t parts of <HI>Eng|land</HI>
at this time; that as &s;oon as they can fi|ni&s;h
their goods they hurry them up to <HI>Lon|don</HI>
to their Factor, and as &s;oon as the goods
are gone, immediately follow them with their
bills for the money, without waiting to hear
whether the goods are come to a market, are
&s;old, or in demand, and whether they are like|ly
to &s;ell quickly or not; thus they load the
factor's warehou&s;e with their goods before they
are wanted, and load the factor with their bills
before it is po&s;&s;ible that he can have gotten
ca&s;h in his hand to pay them.</P>
<P>THIS is, fir&s;t, a direct borrowing money of
their factor; and it is borrowing, as it were,
whether the factor will lend or no, and &s;ome|times
whether he can or no. The factor, if he
be a man of money, and an&s;wers their bills,
fails not to make them pay for advancing; or
&s;ells the goods to lo&s;s to an&s;wer the bills;
which is making them pay dear for the loan;
or refu&s;es their bills, and &s;o baulks both their
bu&s;ine&s;s and their credit.</P>
<P>BUT if the factor, willing to oblige his em|ployers,
and knowing he &s;hall otherwi&s;e lo&s;e
their commi&s;&s;ion, accepts the bills on the cre|dit
of the goods, and then not being able to
<PB N="430" REF="451">
&s;ell the goods in time, is al&s;o made unable to
pay the bills when due; this reflects upon his
credit, tho' the fault is indeed in the drawer
who&s;e effects are not come in; and this has
ruin'd many an hone&s;t factor.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> IT has hurt him by drawing large &s;ums
out of his ca&s;h, for the &s;upply of the needy
manufacturer, who is his employer, and has
thereby made him unable to pay his other bills
currently, even of &s;uch mens drafts who had
perhaps good rea&s;on to draw.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> IT keeps the factor always bare of
money, and wounds his reputation, &s;o that he
pays tho&s;e very bills with di&s;credit, which in
ju&s;tice to him&s;elf he ought not to pay at all,
and the borrower has the money at the expence
of the credit of the lender; whereas indeed the
reproach ought to be to him that borrows, not
to him that lends; to him that draws where
there are no effects to warrant his draft, not
to him that pays where he does not owe.</P>
<P>BUT the damage lies on the circum&s;tance of
accepting the bill, for the factor lends his em|ployer
the money the hour he accepts the bill,
and the blow to his credit is for not paying
when accepted; when the bill is accepted, the
acceptor is debtor to the per&s;on to whom the
bill is payable, or in his right to every endor&s;er;
for a Bill of Exchange is in this ca&s;e differing
from a bond, <HI>viz.</HI> that the right of action is
tran&s;ferrable by endor&s;ement, and every en|dor&s;er
has a right to &s;ue the acceptor in his own
name, and can transfer that right to another;
whereas in a bond, tho' it be given to me by
<PB N="431" REF="452">
a&s;&s;ignment, I mu&s;t &s;ue in the name of the fir&s;t
per&s;on to whom the bond is payable, and he
may at any time di&s;charge the bond, notwith|&s;tanding
my a&s;&s;ignment.</P>
<P>TRADESMEN then, <HI>e&s;pecially &s;uch as are fac|tors,</HI>
are unaccountably to blame to accept bills
for their employers before their goods are &s;old,
and the money receiv'd, or within reach: If
the employers cannot wait, the reproach &s;hould
lie <HI>on them,</HI> not on <HI>the factor;</HI> and indeed the
manufacturers all over <HI>England</HI> are greatly
wrong in that part of their bu&s;ine&s;s; for, not
con&s;idering the difference between a time of
demand and a time of glut, a quick or a dead
market, they go on in the &s;ame cour&s;e of mak|ing,
and without &s;lackning their hands as to
quantity, crowd up their goods, as if it was e|nough
to them that the factor had them, and
that they were to be reckoned as &s;old when
they were in his hands; but would the factor
truly repre&s;ent to them the &s;tate of the mar|ket;
that there are great quantities of goods in
hand un&s;old, and no pre&s;ent demand, de&s;iring
them, to &s;lack their hands a little in making;
and at the &s;ame time back their directions in a
plain and po&s;itive way, tho' with re&s;pect too,
by telling them they could accept no more
bills till the goods were &s;old: This would
bring the trade into a better regulation, and the
makers would &s;top their hands when the mar|ket
&s;top'd; and when the merchant ceas'd to
buy, the manufacturers would cea&s;e to make,
and con&s;equently would not crowd or clog the
marker with goods, or wrong their factors with
bills.</P>
<P><PB N="432" REF="453">
BUT this would require a large di&s;cour&s;e,
and the manufacturers objections &s;hould be an|&s;wered,
<HI>viz.</HI> That they cannot &s;top, that they
have their particular &s;ets of workmen and &s;pin|ners,
whom they are obliged to keep employed,
or if they &s;hould di&s;mi&s;s them they could not
have them again when a demand for goods
came, and the markets reviv'd, and that be&s;ides
the poor would &s;tarve.</P>
<P>THESE objections are ea&s;y to be an&s;wered,
tho' that is not my pre&s;ent bu&s;ine&s;s; but thus
far it is to my purpo&s;e, it is the factor's bu&s;ine&s;s
to keep him&s;elf within compa&s;s; if the goods
cannot be &s;old, the maker mu&s;t &s;tay till they
can; if the poor mu&s;t be employ'd, the manu|facturer
is right to keep them at work if he can;
but if he cannot without oppre&s;&s;ing the factor,
then he makes the factor employ them, not
him&s;elf; and I do not &s;ee the factor has any ob|ligation
upon him to con&s;ider the &s;pinners and
weavers, e&s;pecially not at the expence of his
own credit, and his family's &s;afety.</P>
<P>UPON the whole, all trade&s;men that trade
thus, whether by commi&s;&s;ion from the country,
or upon their own accounts, &s;hould make it
the &s;tanding order of their bu&s;ine&s;s not to &s;uffer
them&s;elves to be over-drawn by their employ|ers,
&s;o as to &s;traiten them&s;elves in their ca&s;h, and
make them unable to pay their bills when ac|cepted.</P>
<P>IT is al&s;o to be ob&s;erved, that when a trade&s;|man
once comes to &s;uffer him&s;elf to be thus
over-drawn, and &s;inks his credit in kindne&s;s to
his employer, he buys his employment &s;o dear
<PB N="433" REF="454">
as all his employer can do for him can never
repay the price.</P>
<P>AND even while he is thus &s;erving his em|ployer
he more and more wounds him&s;elf; for
&s;uppo&s;e he does (with difficulty) rai&s;e money,
and after &s;ome dunning does pay the bills, yet
he lo&s;es in the very doing it, for he never pays
them with credit, but &s;uffers in reputation by
every day's delay. In a word, a trade&s;man
that buys upon credit, that is to &s;ay, in a cour&s;e
of credit, &s;uch as I have de&s;crib'd before, may
let the merchant or the warehou&s;ekeeper call
two or three times, and may put him off with|out
much damage to his credit; and if he
makes them &s;tay one time, he makes it up a|gain
another, and recovers in one good pay|ment,
what he lo&s;t in two or three bad ones.</P>
<P>BUT in Bills of Exchange, or Promi&s;&s;ory
Notes, 'tis quite another thing; and he that va|lues
his reputation in trade &s;hould never let a
bill come twice for payment, or a note under
his hand &s;tay a day after it is due, that is to &s;ay,
after the three days of <HI>grace,</HI> as it is call'd;
Tho&s;e three days indeed are granted to all bills
of exchange, not by law, but by the cu&s;tom of
trade; 'tis hard to tell how this cu&s;tom prevail'd,
or when it began, but it is one of tho&s;e many
in&s;tances which may be given, where cu&s;tom
of trade is equal to an e&s;tabli&s;h'd law; and it
is &s;o much a law now in it &s;elf, that no bill is
prote&s;ted now till tho&s;e three days are expir'd;
nor is a bill of exchange e&s;teem'd due till the
third day; no man offers to demand it, nor
will any Gold&s;mith, or even the <HI>Bank</HI> it &s;elf,
<PB N="434" REF="455">
pay a foreign bill &s;ooner. But that by the
way.</P>
<P>BILLS of Exchange being thus &s;acred in trade,
and inland bills being, (by the late law for pro|te&s;ting
them, and giving intere&s;ts and damage
upon them) made as near as can be, equally &s;a|cred,
nothing can be of more moment to a
trade&s;man, than to pay them always punctually
and honourably.</P>
<P>LET no Critic cavil at the word <HI>honourably,</HI>
as it relates to Trade; punctual payment is the
honour of trade, and there is a word always
u&s;ed among merchants which ju&s;tifies my u&s;ing
it in this
place; and that is, when a merchant
draws a bill from abroad upon his friend at
<HI>London,</HI> his corre&s;pondent in <HI>London</HI> an&s;wering
his letter, and approving his drawing upon him,
adds, that he &s;hall be &s;ure to <HI>honour</HI> his bill
when it appears; that is to &s;ay, to accept it.</P>
<P>LIKEWISE when the drawer gives advice of
his having drawn &s;uch a bill upon him, he
gives an account of the &s;um drawn, the name
of the per&s;on it is payable to, the time it is
drawn at, <HI>that is,</HI> the time given for payment,
and he adds thus, I doubt not your giving my
bill due honour; that is, of accepting it, and
paying it when it is due.</P>
<P>THIS term is al&s;o u&s;ed in another ca&s;e in fo|reign
trade only, <HI>viz.</HI> A merchant abroad (&s;ay
it be at <HI>Lisbon,</HI> or at <HI>Bourdeaux</HI>) draws a bill
of 300 <HI>l.</HI> &s;terling upon his corre&s;pondent at
<HI>London:</HI> The corre&s;pondent happens to be dead,
or is broke, or by &s;ome other accident the bill
is not accepted; another merchant on the <HI>Ex|change</HI>
<PB N="435" REF="456">
hearing of it, and knowing, and perhaps
corre&s;ponding with the merchant abroad who
drew the bill, and loth his credit &s;hould &s;uffer
by the bill going back prote&s;ted, accepts it,
and pays it for him. This is call'd accepting it
for the honour of the drawer; and he writes &s;o
upon the bill when he accepts it, which entitles
him to re-draw the &s;ame &s;um with intere&s;t up|on
the drawer in <HI>Lisbon,</HI> or <HI>Bourdeaux,</HI> as a|bove.</P>
<P>THIS is indeed a ca&s;e peculiar to foreign com|merce,
and is not often practi&s;ed in home-trade,
and among &s;hop-keepers, tho' &s;ometimes I have
known it practi&s;ed here too: but I name it on
two accounts; fir&s;t, to legitimate the word <HI>ho|nourable,</HI>
which I had u&s;ed, and which has its
due propriety in matters of trade, tho' not in the
&s;ame acceptation as it generally receives in com|mon
affairs; and &s;econdly, to let the Trade&s;man
&s;ee how deeply the Honour, that is, the credit
of trade is concerned in the punctual payment
of Bills of Exchange; and the like of Promi&s;|&s;ory
Notes, for in point of credit there is no
difference, tho' in matter of form there is.</P>
<P>AND now I have mentioned the form of a
Bill, and the difference there is between a Bill
of Exchange and a Promi&s;&s;ory Note, I think
the trade&s;man will not take it ill that I give a
little direction about the form of both: a Trade&s;|man
in <HI>London</HI> may perhaps think him&s;elf ill
u&s;ed, in being dictated to in &s;uch a ca&s;e, and
think it is to &s;uppo&s;e he cannot read, and that he
&s;hould be &s;ent to &s;chool again to learn his horn-book;
but all in&s;truction is to the ignorant;
<PB N="436" REF="457">
they that know it may pa&s;s it over, it is not
written for them; and they that are ignorant
will not be angry if they find here what may
inform them, without putting them to the mor|tification
of expo&s;ing their ignorance by doing
a thing wrong, which they may &s;o ea&s;ily &s;ee
how to do right.</P>
<P>THERE are a great many variations in the
drawing bills from foreign countries, according
as the cu&s;toms and u&s;ages of merchants direct,
and according as the coins and rates of ex|change
differ, and according as the &s;ame terms
are differently under&s;tood in &s;everal places; as
the word <HI>U&s;ance</HI> and <HI>two U&s;ance,</HI> which is a
term for the number of days given for pay|ment,
after the date of the Bill; and tho' this
is a thing particularly relating to merchants,
and to foreign commerce, yet as the nature of
Bills of Exchange is pretty general, and that
&s;ometimes an inland trade&s;man, e&s;pecially in
&s;ea-port towns, may be obliged to take foreign
accepted Bills in payment for their goods; or if
they have money to &s;pare (as &s;ometimes it is
an inland trade&s;man's good luck to have) may
be asked to di&s;count &s;uch Bills; I &s;ay, on this
account, and that they may know the value of
a foreign Bill when they &s;ee it, and how far it
has to run, before it is to be demanded, I think
it not foreign to the ca&s;e before me, to give
them the following account.</P>
<P>1. As to the times of payment in foreign
Bills of Exchange, and the terms of art ordi|narily
u&s;ed by merchants in drawing, <HI>and ex|pre&s;s'd
in</HI> the &s;aid bills; the times of payment
<PB N="437" REF="458">
are, as above, either (1.) At &s;ight; which is to
be under&s;tood, not the day it is pre&s;ented, but
three days (call'd days of grace) after the bill is
accepted: (2.) U&s;ance: (3.) Two U&s;ance. There
are al&s;o u&s;ages of towns and places during great
fairs held in tho&s;e places; as a bill drawn on a
merchant at <HI>Madrid</HI> during the great fair there,
and accepted in the fair, is payable at four
months; at <HI>Lyons</HI> the like is three months, and
at <HI>Frankfort au main</HI> is &s;ix months. But to
&s;peak of the words U&s;ance, and Two U&s;ance
only, which are the terms generally us'd now,
in drawing Bills in foreign trade, they are un|der&s;tood
as fotlows:</P>
<Q><P>USANCE between <HI>London</HI> and all the towns
in the States General's Dominions, and al|&s;o
in the provinces now call'd the <HI>Au|&s;trian
Netherlands,</HI> is one month: And
Two U&s;ance is two months; reckoning
not from the acceptance of the bill, but
from the date of it.</P>
<P>USANCE between <HI>London</HI> and <HI>Hamburgh,</HI> is
two months, <HI>Venice</HI> is three months; and
Double U&s;ance, or Two U&s;ance, is double
that time.</P>
<P>USANCE payable at <HI>Florence</HI> or <HI>Leghorn,</HI> is
two months; but from thence payable at
<HI>London,</HI> U&s;ance is three months.</P>
<P>USANCE from <HI>London</HI> to <HI>Roan</HI> or <HI>Paris,</HI> is
one month; but they generally draw at a
certain number of days, u&s;ually twenty
one days &s;ight.</P>
<P><PB N="438" REF="459">
USANCE from <HI>London</HI> to <HI>Seville,</HI> is two
months; as likewi&s;e between <HI>London</HI> and
<HI>Lisbon,</HI> and <HI>Oporto,</HI> to or from.</P>
<P>USANCE from <HI>Genoa</HI> to <HI>Rome</HI> is payable at
<HI>Rome</HI> ten days after &s;ight.</P>
<P>USANCE between <HI>Antwerp</HI> and <HI>Genoa, Na|ples</HI>
or <HI>Me&s;&s;ina,</HI> is two months, whether to
or from.</P>
<P>USANCE from <HI>Antwerp</HI> or <HI>Am&s;terdam,</HI> pay|able
at <HI>Venice,</HI> is two months, payable in
Bank.</P></Q>
<P>THERE are abundance of niceties in the ac|cepting
and paying of Bills of Exchange, e&s;pe|cially
foreign Bills, which I think needle&s;s to
enter upon here; but this I think I &s;hould not
omit, namely,</P>
<P>THAT if a man pays a Bill of Exchange be|fore
it is due, tho' he had accepted it, If the
man to whom it was payable proves a bank|rupt
after he has received the money, and yet
before the Bill becomes due, the per&s;on who
voluntarily paid the money before it was due,
&s;hall be liable to pay it again to the remitter;
for as the remitter deliver'd his money to the
drawer, in order to have it paid again to &s;uch
per&s;on as he &s;hould order, it is, and ought to
be in his power to divert the payment by alter|ing
the Bill, and make it payable to any other
per&s;on whom he thinks fit, during all the time
between the acceptance and the day of pay|ment.</P>
<P><PB N="439" REF="460">
THIS has been controverted, I know, in &s;ome
ca&s;es, but I have always found that by the mo&s;t
experienced merchants, and e&s;pecially in places
of the greate&s;t bu&s;ine&s;s abroad, it was always
given in favour of the remitter; <HI>viz.</HI> that the right
of guiding the payment is in him, all the time
the bill is running; and no bill can or ought
to be paid before it is due, without the declared
a&s;&s;ent of the remitter, &s;ignify'd under his hand,
and atte&s;ted by a publick notary.</P>
<P>THERE are, I &s;ay, abundance of niceties in
the matter of foreign exchanges, and in the
manner of drawing, accepting and prote&s;ting
Bills; as al&s;o in the calculating the value of
the coins they are payable in, and payable for,
reducing them into a proportioned value to one
another, which if I &s;hould enter into an en|quiry
about here, it would be needful to de|&s;cribe
all the &s;everal coins, as well real as ima|ginary,
that are u&s;ually mentioned in ex|changes,
which would be too long for this
works; and as I am now &s;peaking with, and
have confin'd my di&s;cour&s;e in this work to the
Inland trade&s;men of <HI>England,</HI> I think it would
be as unprofitable to them to meddle with this,
as it would be difficult to them to under&s;tand it.</P>
<P>I return therefore to the &s;ubject in hand, as
well as to the people to whom I have all along
directed my di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<P>THO' the Inland trade&s;men do not, and need
not acquaint them&s;elves with the manner of
foreign Exchanges, yet there is a great deal of
bu&s;ine&s;s done by exchange among our &s;elves,
<PB N="440" REF="461">
and at home, and in which our inland trade
is chiefly concern'd; and as this is the rea&s;on
why I &s;peak &s;o much, and repeat it &s;o often
to the trade&s;man for who&s;e in&s;truction I am
writing, that he &s;hould maintain the credit of
his bills, &s;o it may not be ami&s;s to give the
trade&s;man &s;ome directions concerning &s;uch Bills.</P>
<P>1. A very great part of the bills drawn out
of the &s;everal counties in <HI>England</HI> upon the
trade&s;men in <HI>London,</HI> &s;uch as factors and ware|hou&s;e-keepers,
are made payable to the General
Receivers of the &s;everal taxes and duties, Cu&s;|toms
and exci&s;es which are levied in the coun|try
in &s;pecie, and the money is remitted by tho&s;e
collectors
and receivers on account of tho&s;e
duties; This generally appears by the bills or
the endor&s;ements, which often mention it in
the&s;e words, <HI>for his Maje&s;ty's u&s;e;</HI> In this ca&s;e
a default of payment of any of the&s;e bills, af|ter
being accepted, expo&s;es the trade&s;man to the
terror as well as the terrible operation of an
Extent; which would, <HI>at lea&s;t might</HI> be to his
utter ruin and undoing; not only his credit is
bla&s;ted, but his whole Fortune and figure is de|moli&s;hed
at once, for an Extent tears all to
pieces.</P>
<P>2. HE is to con&s;ider, that in other bills where
there is not the immediate hazard of an Ex|tent,
yet the bills them&s;elves pa&s;s frequently
from one hand to another by endor&s;ement, and
if the bill comes to be prote&s;ted afterwards
<PB N="441" REF="462">
and returned, it goes back again thro' all tho&s;e
hands with this mark of the Trade&s;man's di&s;|grace
upon it, namely, that it has been accept|ed,
but that the man who accepted it is not
able to pay it, than which nothing can expo&s;e
the Trade&s;man more.</P>
<P>3. HE is to con&s;ider that the grand charac|teri&s;tick
of a Trade&s;man, and by which his cre|dit
is rated, is this of paying his Bills <HI>well</HI> or
<HI>ill.</HI> If any man goes to the neighbours or deal|ers
of a trade&s;man to enquire of his credit, or
his fame in bu&s;ine&s;s, which is often done upon
almo&s;t every extraordinary occa&s;ion, the fir&s;t
que&s;tion is, How does he pay his Bills? As
when we go to a ma&s;ter or mi&s;tre&s;s to enquire
the character of a maid-&s;ervant, one of the fir&s;t
que&s;tions generally is of her probity, <HI>Is &s;he ho|ne&s;t?</HI>
&s;o here, if you would be able to judge of
the man, your fir&s;t que&s;tion is, What for a
payma&s;ter is he? How does he pay his bills?
Strongly intimating, and indeed very rea&s;on|ably,
that if he has any credit, or any regard
to his credit, he will be &s;ure to pay his bills
well; and if he does not pay his bills well, he
cannot be &s;ound at bottom, becau&s;e he would
never &s;uffer a &s;lur there, if it were po&s;&s;ible for
him to avoid it. On the other hand, if a
trade&s;man pays his bills punctually, let what|ever
other &s;lur be upon his reputation, his cre|dit
will hold good. I knew a man in the
city who upon all occa&s;ions of bu&s;ine&s;s i&s;&s;ued
promi&s;&s;ory notes, or notes under his hand, at
<GAP DESC="DUPLICATE" EXTENT="1 page">
<PB N="440" REF="463">
<GAP DESC="DUPLICATE" EXTENT="1 page">
<PB N="441" REF="464">

<PB N="442" REF="465">
&s;uch or &s;uch time, and it was for an immen&s;e
&s;um of money that he gave out &s;uch notes;
&s;o that they became frequent in trade, and at
length people began to carry them about to
di&s;count, which le&s;&s;ened the Gentleman &s;o
much, (tho' he was really a man of &s;ub&s;tance)
that his bills went at la&s;t at 20 <HI>per cent.</HI> di&s;|count,
or more; and yet this man maintain'd
his credit by this, that tho' he would always
take as much time as he could get in the&s;e
notes, yet when they came due they were al|ways
punctually paid to a day; no man came
twice for his money.</P>
<P>THIS was a trying ca&s;e, for tho' upon the
multitude of his notes that were out, and by
rea&s;on of the large di&s;count given upon them,
his credit at fir&s;t &s;uffered exceedingly, and men
began to talk very dubiou&s;ly of him; yet up|on
the punctual di&s;charge of them when due,
it began pre&s;ently to be taken notice of, and
&s;aid openly how well he paid his notes; upon
which pre&s;ently the rate of his di&s;count fell,
and in a &s;hort time all his notes were at <HI>par;</HI> &s;o
that punctual payment, in &s;pite of rumour (and
of a rumour not &s;o ill grounded as rumours
generally are) prevail'd, and e&s;tabli&s;h'd the cre|dit
of the per&s;on who was indeed rich at bot|tom,
but might have found it hard enough to
have &s;tood it, if as his bills had a high di&s;|count
upon them they had been ill paid too.
All which confirms what I have hitherto al|ledged,
namely, of how much concern it is for
a trade&s;man to pay his Bills, and Promi&s;&s;ory Notes
very punctually.</P>
<P><PB N="443" REF="466">
I might argue here how much it is his in|tere&s;t
to do &s;o, and how it enables him to coin
as many bills as he plea&s;es; <HI>in &s;hort,</HI> a man
who&s;e notes are currently paid, and the credit
of who&s;e Bills is e&s;tabli&s;h'd by their being
punctually paid, has an infinite advantage in
Trade; he is a Bank to him&s;elf, he can buy
what bargains he plea&s;es, no advantage in bu&s;i|ne&s;s
offers but he can gra&s;p at it, for his Notes
are current as another man's ca&s;h, if he buys
at Time in the country, he has nothing to do
but to order them to draw for the money
when it is due, and he gains all the time given
in the bills into the bargain.</P>
<P>IF he knows what he buys, and how to put
it off, he buys a thou&s;and pounds worth of
goods at once, &s;ells them for le&s;s time than
he buys at, and pays them with their own
money. I might &s;well this di&s;cour&s;e to a vo|lume
by it &s;elf, to &s;et out the particular profit
that &s;uch a man may make of his Credit, and
how he can rai&s;e what &s;ums he will, by buying
goods, and by ordering the people who he is to
pay in the country, to draw bills on him: Nor
is it any lo&s;s to tho&s;e he buys of, for as all the
Remitters of money know his Bills, and they
are currently paid, they never &s;cruple deliver|ing
their money upon his Bills, &s;o that the
countryman or manufacturer is effectually &s;up|plied,
and the Time given in the bill is the
property of the current dealer on whom they
are drawn.</P>
<P><PB N="444" REF="467">
BUT then let me add a caution here for
the be&s;t of trade&s;men not to neglect, <HI>viz.</HI>
As the Trade&s;man &s;hould take care to pay his
bills and notes currently, &s;o, that he may do
it, he mu&s;t be careful what notes he i&s;&s;ues out,
and how he &s;uffers others to draw on him.
He that is careful of his reputation in bu&s;ine&s;s,
will al&s;o be cautious not to let any man he
deals with over-draw him, or Draw upon him
before the Money Drawn for is due: And as
to Notes promi&s;&s;ory, or under his hand, he is
careful not to give out &s;uch Notes but on
good occa&s;ions, and where he has the effects
in his hand to an&s;wer them; this keeps his
ca&s;h whole, and pre&s;erves his ability of per|forming
and punctually paying when the Notes
become Due; and the want of this caution has
ruin'd the reputation of a Trade&s;man many
times, when he might otherwi&s;e have pre&s;erv'd
him&s;elf in as good credit and condition as o|ther
men.</P>
<P>ALL the&s;e cautions are made thus needful
on account of that one u&s;eful maxim, that the
Trade&s;man's ALL depends upon his punctual
complying with the payment of his Bills. I
conclude this work with ob&s;erving that many
Trade&s;men, in the country e&s;pecially, being
ignorant of the form of drawing bills, it may
be u&s;eful to give them &s;ome &s;uch forms as will
