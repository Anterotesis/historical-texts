<P>THE carriages were at the gates at an
early hour; the bu&s;tle of the dome&s;tics,
pa&s;&s;ing to and fro in the galleries, awakened
Emily from hara&s;&s;ing &s;lumbers: her un|quiet
mind had, during the night, pre&s;ented
her with terrific images and ob&s;cure circum|&s;tances,
concerning her affection and her
future life. She now endeavoured to cha&s;e
away the impre&s;&s;ions they had left on her
fancy; but from imaginary evils &s;he awoke
to the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of real ones. Recol|lecting
<PB N="2" REF="4">
that &s;he had parted with valancourt,
perhaps for ever, her heart &s;ickened as me|mory
revived. But &s;he tried to di&s;mi&s;s the
di&s;mal forebodings that crowded on her
mind, and to re&s;train the &s;orrow which &s;he
could not &s;ubdue; efforts which diffu&s;ed
over the &s;ettled melancholy of her counte|nance
an expre&s;&s;ion of tempered re&s;igna|tion,
as a thin veil, thrown over the fea|tures
of beauty, renders them more inte|re&s;ting
by a partial concealment. But
Madame Montoni ob&s;erved nothing in this
countenance except its unu&s;ual palene&s;s,
which attracted her cen&s;ure. She told her
niece, that &s;he had been indulging in fan|ciful
&s;orrows, and begged &s;he would have
more regard for decorum, than to let the
world &s;ee that &s;he could not renounce an
improper attachment; at which Emily's
pale cheek became flu&s;hed with crim&s;on,
but it was the blu&s;h of pride, and &s;he
made no an&s;wer. Soon after, Montoni
entered the breakfa&s;t room, &s;poke little,
and &s;eemed impatient to be gone.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="5">
The windows of this room opened upon
the garden. As Emily pa&s;&s;ed them, &s;he &s;aw
the &s;pot where &s;he had parted with Va|lancourt
on the preceding night: the re|membrance
pre&s;&s;ed heavily on her heart,
and &s;he turened ha&s;tily away from the ob|ject
that had awakened it.</P>
<P>The baggage being at length adju&s;ted,
the travellers entered their carriages, and
Emily would have left the chateau with|out
one &s;igh of regret, had it not been
&s;ituated in the neighbourhood of Valan|court's
re&s;idence.</P>
<P>From a little eminence &s;he looked back
upon Tholou&s;e, and the far-&s;een plains of
Ga&s;cony, beyond which the broken &s;um|mits
of the Pyrenées appeared on the di&s;|tant
horizon, lighted up by a morning &s;un.
&startq;Dear plea&s;ant mountains!&endq; &s;aid &s;he to her|&s;elt,
&startq;how long may it be ere I &s;ee ye again,
and how much may happen to make me
mi&s;erable in the interval! oh, could I now
be certain, that I &s;hould ever return to
ye, and find that Valancourt &s;till lived
<PB N="4" REF="6">
for me, I &s;hould go in peace! He will
&s;till gaze on ye, gaze when I am far
away!&endq;</P>
<P>The trees, that impended over the high
banks of the road and formed a line of
per&s;pective with the di&s;tant country, now
threatened to exclude the view of them;
but the bluei&s;h mountains &s;till appeared
beyond the dark foliage, and Emily con|tinued
to lean from the coach window,
till at length the clo&s;ing branches &s;hut them
from her &s;ight.</P>
<P>Another object &s;oon caught her atten|tion.
She had &s;carcely looked at a per&s;on
who walked along the bank, with his hat,
in which was the military feather, drawn
over his eyes, before, at the &s;ound of wheels,
he &s;uddenly truned, and &s;he perceived that
it was Valancourt him&s;elf, who waved his
hand, &s;prung into the road, and through
the window of the carriage put a letter into
her hand. He endeavoured to &s;mile through
the de&s;pair that over&s;pread his countenance
as &s;he pa&s;&s;ed on. The remembrance of
<PB N="5" REF="7">
that &s;mile &s;eemed impre&s;&s;ed on Emily's
mind for ever. She leaned from the win|dow,
and &s;aw him on a knoll of the broken
bank, leaning again&s;t the high trees that
waved over him, and pur&s;uing the carriage
with his eyes. He waved his hand, and &s;he
continued to gaze till di&s;tance confu&s;ed his
figure, and at length another turn of the
road entirely &s;eparated him from her
&s;ight.</P>
<P>Having &s;topped to take up Signor Ca|vigni
at a chateau on the road, the travel|lers,
of whom Emily was di&s;re&s;pectfully
&s;eated with Madame Montoni's woman in
a &s;econd carriage, pur&s;ued their way over
the plains of Languedoc. The per&s;ence
of this &s;ervant re&s;trained Emily from read|ing
Valancourt's letter, for the did not
choo&s;e to expo&s;e the emotions it might oc|ca&s;ion
to the ob&s;ervation of any per&s;on.
Yet &s;uch was her wi&s;h to read this his la&s;t
Communication, that her. trembling hand.
was every moment on the point of breaking
the &s;eal</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="8">
At length they reached the village,
where they &s;taid only to change hor&s;es,
without alighting, and it was not till they
&s;topped to dine, that Emily had an oppor|tunity
of reading the letter. Though &s;he
had never doubted the &s;incerity of Valan|court's
affection, the fre&s;h a&s;&s;urances &s;he
now received of it revived her &s;pirits; &s;he
wept over his letter in tenderne&s;s, laid it by
to be referred to when they &s;hould be par|ticularly
depre&s;&s;ed, and then thought of him
with much le&s;s angui&s;h then &s;he had done
&s;ince they parted. Among &s;ome other re|que&s;ts,
which were intere&s;ting to her, be|cau&s;e
expre&s;&s;ive of his tenderne&s;s, and be|cau&s;e
a compliance with them &s;eemed to
annihilate for a while the pain of ab&s;ence,
he entreated &s;he would always think of him
at &s;un-&s;et. &startq;you will then meet me in
thought,&endq; &s;aid he; &startq;I &s;hall con&s;tantly
watch the &s;un-&s;et, and I &s;hall be happy in
the belief, that your eyes are fixed upon the
&s;ame object with mine, and that our minds
are conver&s;ing. You Know not, Emily, the
<PB N="7" REF="9">
comfort I promi&s;e my&s;elf form the&s;e mo|ments;
but I tru&s;t you will experience
it.&endq;</P>
<P>It is unnece&s;&s;ary to &s;ay with what emotion
Emily, on this evening, watched the de|clining
&s;un, over a long extent of plains,
on wich. &s;he &s;aw it &s;et without interrup|tion,
and &s;ink towards the province which
Valancourt inhabited. After this hour her
mind became far more tranquil and re|&s;igned,
than it had been &s;ince the marriage
of Montoni and her aunt.</P>
<P>During &s;everal day the travellers jour|neyed
over the plains of Languedoc; and
then entering Dauphiny, and winding for
&s;ome time among the mountains of that ro|mantic
province, they quitted their car|riages
and began to a&s;cend the Alps. And
here &s;uch &s;cenes of &s;ublimity opened upon
them as no colours of language mu&s;t dare
to paint; Emily's mind was even &s;o much
engaged with new and wonderful images,
that they &s;ometimes bani&s;hed the idea of
Valancourt, though they more frequently
<PB N="8" REF="10">
revived it. The&s;e brought to her recol|lection
the pro&s;pects among the Pyrenées,
which they had admired together, and had
believed nothing could excel in grandeur.
How often did &s;he wi&s;h to expre&s;s to him
the new emotions which this a&s;toni&s;hing
&s;cenery awakened, and that he could par|take
of them! sometimes too &s;he endea|voured
to anticipate his remarks, and al|mo&s;t
imagined him pre&s;ent. She &s;eemed
to have ari&s;en to another world, and to
have left every trifiing thought, every trifling
&s;entiment, in that below; tho&s;e only of
grandeur and &s;ublimity now dilated her
mind, and elevated the affections of her
heart.</P>
<P>With what emotions of &s;ublimity, &s;oftened
by tenderne&s;s, did &s;he meet Valancourt in
thought, at the cu&s;tomary hour of &s;un-&s;et,
when, wandering among the Alps, &s;he
watched the glorious orb &s;ink amid their
&s;ummits, his la&s;t tints die away on their
&s;nowy points, and a &s;olemn ob&s;curity &s;teal
over the &s;cene! And when the la&s;t gleam
<PB N="9" REF="11">
had faded, &s;he turned her eyes from the
we&s;t with &s;omewhat of the melancholy re|gret
that is experienced after the departure
of a beloved friend; while the&s;e lonely feel|ings
were heightened by the &s;preading
gloom, and by the low &s;ounds, heard only
when darkne&s;s confines attention, which
make the gerneral &s;tillne&s;s more impre&s;&s;ive&mdash;
leaves &s;hook by the air, the la&s;t &s;igh of the
breeze that lingers after &s;un-&s;et, or the
murmur of di&s;tant &s;treams.</P>
<P>During the fir&s;t days of this journey
among the Alps, the &s;cenery exhibited a
wonderful mixture of &s;olitude and inhabi|tation,
of cultivation and barrenne&s;s. On
the edge of tremendous precipices, and
within the hollow of the cliffs, below which
the clouds often floated, were &s;een villages,
&s;pires, and convent towers; while green
pa&s;tures and vineyards &s;pread their hues at
the feet of perpendicular rocks of marble,
or of granite, who&s;e points, tufted with
alpine &s;hrubs, or exhibiting only ma&s;&s;y
crags, ro&s;e above each other, till they ter|minated
<PB N="10" REF="12">
in the &s;now-topt mountain, whence
the torrent fell, that thundered along the
valley.</P>
<P>The &s;now was not yet melted on the
&s;ummit of Mount Cenis, over which the
travellers pa&s;&s;ed; but Emily, as &s;he looked
upon its clear lake and extended plain,
&s;urrounded by broken cliffs, &s;aw, in ima|gination,
the verdant beauty it would exhi|bit
when the &s;nows &s;hould be gone, and
the &s;hepherds, leading up the mid&s;ummer
flocks from Piedmont, to pa&s;ture on its
flowery &s;ummit, &s;hould add Arcadian fi|gures
to Arcadian land&s;cape.</P>
<P>As &s;he de&s;cended on the Italian &s;ide, the
precipices became &s;till more tremendous,
and the pro&s;pects &s;till more wild and ma|je&s;tic,
over which the &s;hifting lights threw
all the pomp of colouring. Emily delight|ed
to ob&s;erve the &s;nowy tops of the moun|tains
under the pa&s;&s;ing influence of the day,
blu&s;hing with morning, glowing with the
brightne&s;s of noon, or ju&s;t tinted with the
purple evening. The haunt of man could
<PB N="11" REF="13">
now only be di&s;covered by the &s;imple hut
of the &s;hepherd and the hunter, or by the
rough pine bridge thrown acro&s;s the tor|rent,
to a&s;&s;i&s;t the latter in his cha&s;e of the
chamois over crags where, but for this
ve&s;tige of man, it would have been be|lieved
only the chamois or the wolf dared
to venture. As Emily gazed upon one of
the&s;e perilous bridges, with the cataract
foaming beneath it, &s;ome images came to
her mind, which &s;he afterwards combined
in the following</P>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>STORIED SONNET.</HEAD>
<L>The weary traveller, who, all night long,</L>
<L>Has climb'd among the Alps' tremendous &s;teeps,</L>
<L>Skirting the pathle&s;s precipice, where throng</L>
<L>Wild forms of danger; as he onward creeps</L>
<L>If, chance, his anxious eye at di&s;tance &s;ees</L>
<L>The mountain- &s;hepherd's &s;olitary home,</L>
<L>Peeping from forth the moon- illumin'd trees'</L>
<L>What &s;udden tran&s;ports to his bo&s;om come!</L>
<L>But, if between &s;ome hideous cha&s;m yawn,</L>
<L>Where the cleft pine a doubtful bridge di&s;plays,</L>
<L>In dreadful, &s;ilence, on the brink, forlorn</L>
<L>He &s;tands, and views in the faint rays</L>
<L><PB N="12" REF="14">
Far far below, the torrent's ri&s;ing &s;urge,</L>
<L>And li&s;tens to the wild impetuous roar;</L>
<L>Still eyes the depth, &s;till &s;hudders on the verge,</L>
<L>Fears to return, nor dares to venture o'er.</L>
<L>De&s;perate, at length the tottering plank he tries,</L>
<L>His weak &s;teps &s;lide, he &s;hrieks, he &s;inks-he dies!</L>
<P>Emily, often as &s;he travelled among the
clouds, watched in &s;ilent awe their billowy
&s;urges rolling below; &s;ometimes, wholly
clo&s;ing upon the &s;cene, they appeared like
a world of chaos, and, at others, &s;preading
thinly, they opened and admitted partial
catches of the land&s;cape&mdash;the torrent, who&s;e
a&s;tounding roar had never failed, tum|bling
down the rockey cha&s;m, huge cliffs
white with &s;now, or the dark &s;ummits of the
pine fore&s;ts, that &s;tretched mid-way down
the mountains. But who may de&s;cribe her
rapture, when, having pa&s;&s;ed through a &s;ea
of vapour, &s;he caught a fir&s;t view of Italy;
when, from the ridge of one of tho&s;e tre|mendous
precipices that hang upon Mount
Cenis and guard the entrance of that en|chanting
country, &s;he loked down through
<PB N="13" REF="15">
the lower clouds, and, as they floated away,
&s;aw the gra&s;&s;y vales of Piedmont at her
feet, and, beyond, the plains of Lombardy
extending to the farthe&s;t di&s;tance, at which
appeared, on the faint horizon, the doubt|ful
towers of Turin?</P>
<P>The &s;olitary grandeur of the objects that
immediately &s;urrounded her, the moun|tain-region
towering above, the deep preci|pices
that fell beneath, the waving black|ne&s;s
of the fore&s;ts of pine and oak, which
&s;kirted their feet, or hung within their re|ce&s;&s;es,
the headlong torrents that, da&s;hing
among their cliffs, &s;ometimes appeared like
a cloud of mi&s;t, at others like a &s;heet of ice&mdash;
the&s;e were features which received a higher
character of &s;ublimity from the repo&s;ing
beauty of the Italian land&s;cape below,
&s;tretching to the wide horizon, where the
&s;ame melting blue tint &s;eemed to unite earth
and &s;ky.</P>
<P>Madame Montoni only &s;huddered as &s;he
looked down precipices near who&s;e edge
the chairmen trotted lightly and &s;wiftly,
<PB N="14" REF="16">
almo&s;t, as the chamois bounded, and from
which Emily too recoiled; but with her
fears were mingled &s;uch various emotions
of delight, &s;uch admiration, a&s;toni&s;hment,
and awe, as &s;he had never experienced
before.</P>
<P>Meanwhile the carriers, having come to a
landing- place, &s;topped to re&s;t, and the tra|vellers
being &s;eated on the point of a cliff,
Montoni and Cavigni renewed a di&s;pute
concerning Hannibal's pa&s;&s;age over the
Alps, Montoni contending that he entered
Italy by way of Mount Cenis, and Cavigni,
That he pa&s;&s;ed over Mount St. Bernard. The
&s;ubject brought to Emily's imagination the
di&s;a&s;ters he had &s;uffered in this bold and
perilous adventure. She &s;aw his va&s;t armies
winding among the defiles, and over the
tremendous cliffs of the mountains, which
at night were lighted up by his fires, or by
the torches which he cau&s;ed to be carried
when he pur&s;ued his indefatigable march.
In the eye of fancy, &s;he perceived the gleam
of arms through the du&s;kine&s;s of night,
<PB N="15" REF="17">
the glitter of &s;pears and helmets, and the
banners floating dimly on the twilight;
while now and then the bla&s;t of a di&s;tant
trumpet echoed along the defile, and the
&s;ignal was an&s;wered by a momentary cla&s;h
of arms. She looked with horror upon the
mountaineers, perched on the higher cliffs,
a&s;&s;ailing the troops below with broken frag|ments
of the mountain; on &s;oldiers and
elephants tumbling headlong down the
lower precipices; and, as &s;he li&s;tened to the
rebounding rocks, that followed their fall,
the terrors of fancy yielded to tho&s;e of rea|lity,
and &s;he &s;huddered to behold her&s;elf on
the dizzy height, whence &s;he had pictured
the de&s;cent of others.</P>
<P>Madame Montoni, meantime, as &s;he look|ed
upon Italy, was contemplating in ima|gination
the &s;plendour of palaces and the
grandeur of ca&s;tles, &s;uch as &s;he belived &s;he
was going to be mi&s;tre&s;s of at Venice and
in the Apennine, and &s;he became, in idea,
little le&s;s then prince&s;s. Being no longer
under the alarms which had deterred her
<PB N="16" REF="18">
from giving entertainments to the beauties
of Tholou&s;e, whom Montoni had mentioned
with more <HI>eclat</HI> to his own vanity than
credit to their di&s;cretion, or regard to truth,
&s;he determined to give concerts, though &s;he
had neither ear nor ta&s;te for mu&s;ic; <HI>conver|&s;azioni,</HI>
though &s;he had no talents for con|ver&s;ation;
and to outvie, if po&s;&s;ible, in the
gaieties of her parties and the magnificence
of her liveries, all the noble&s;&s;e of Venice.
This bli&s;sful reverie was &s;omewhat ob&s;cured,
when &s;he recollected the signor, her hu&s;|band
who, though he was not aver&s;e to
the profit which &s;ometimes re&s;ults from &s;uch
parties, had always &s;hewn a contempt of
the frivolous parade that &s;ometimes attends
them; till &s;he con&s;idered that his pride
might be gratified by di&s;playing, among
his own friends, in his native city, the
wealth which he had neglected in France;
and &s;he courted again the &s;plendid illu&s;ions
that had charmed her before.</P>
<P>The travellers, as they de&s;cended, gradu|ally,
exchanged the region of winter for the
<PB N="17" REF="19">
genial warmth and beauty of &s;pring. The
&s;ky began to a&s;&s;ume that &s;erene and beauti|ful
tint peculiar to the climate of Italy;
patches of young verdure, fragrant &s;hrubsand
flowers looked gaily among the rocks, often
fringing their rugged brows, or hanging in
tufts from their broken &s;ides; and the buds
of the oak and mountain a&s;h were expand|ing
into foliage. De&s;cending lower, the
orange and the myrtle, every now and then,
appeared in &s;ome &s;unny nook, with their
yellow blo&s;&s;oms peeping from among the
dark green of their leaves, and mingling
with the &s;carlet flowers of the pomegranate
and the paler ones of that arbutus, that ran
mantling to the crags above; while, lower
&s;till, &s;pread the pa&s;tures of piedmont, where
early flocks were cropping the luxuriant
herbage of &s;pring.</P>
<P>The river Doria, which, ri&s;ing on the
&s;ummit of Mount Cenis, had da&s;hed for
many leagues over the precipices that bor|dered
the road, now began to a&s;&s;ume a le&s;s
impetuous, though &s;carcely le&s;s romantic
<PB N="18" REF="20">
character, as it approached the green vallies
of Piedmont, into which the travellers de|&s;cended
with the evening &s;un; and Emily
found her&s;elf once more amid the tranquil
beauty of pa&s;toral &s;cenery; among flocks
and herds, and &s;lopes tufted with woods of
lively verdure and with beautiful &s;hrubs,
&s;uch as &s;he had often &s;een waving luxuri|antly
over the alps above. The verdure of
the pa&s;turage, now varied with the hues of
early flowers, among which were yellow ra|nunculu&s;es
and pan&s;ey violets of delicious
fragrance, &s;he had never &s;een excelled.&mdash;
Emily almo&s;t wi&s;hed to become a pea&s;ant of
Piedmont, to inhabit one of the plea&s;ant of
embowered cottages which &s;he &s;aw peeping
beneath the cliffs, and to pa&s;s her carele&s;s
hours among the&s;e romantic land&s;capes.
To the hours, the months, &s;he was to pa&s;s
under the dominion of Montoni, &s;he looked
with apprehen&s;ion; while those which were
departed &s;he remembered with regret and
&s;orrow.</P>
<P>In the pre&s;ent &s;cenes her fancy often
<PB N="19" REF="21">
gave her the figure of Valancourt, whom
&s;he &s;aw on a point of the cliffs, gazing with
awe and admiration on the imagery around
him; or wandering pen&s;ively along the
vale below, frequently pau&s;ing to look
back upon the &s;cenery, and then his coun|tenance
glowing with the poet's fire, pur|suing
his way to &s;ome overhanging height.
When &s;he again con&s;idered the time and
the di&s;tance that were to &s;eparate them,
that every &s;tep &s;he now took lengthened
this di&s;tance, her heart &s;unk, and the &s;ur|rounding
land&s;cape charmed her no more.</P>
<P>The travellers, pa&s;&s;ing Novale&s;a, reached,
after the evening had clo&s;ed, the &s;mall and
antient town of Su&s;a, which had formerly
guarded this pa&s;s of the Alps into Pied|mont.
The heights which command it
had, &s;ince the invention of artillery, ren|dered
its fortifications u&s;ele&s;s; but the&s;e
romantic heights, &s;een by moon-light, with
the town below, &s;urrounded by its walls
and watch-towers, and partially illumined,
exhibited an intere&s;ting picture to Emily.
<PB N="20" REF="22">
Here they re&s;ted for the night at an inn,
which had little accommodation to boa&s;t
of; but the travellers brought with them
the hunger that gives delicious flavour to
the coar&s;e&s;t viands, and the wearine&s;s that
en&s;ures repo&s;e; and here Emily fir&s;t caught
a &s;train of Italian mu&s;ic, on Italian ground.
As &s;he &s;at after &s;upper at a little window,
that opened upon a country, ob&s;erving
an effect of the moon-light on the broken
&s;urface of the mountains, and remembering
that on &s;uch a night as this &s;he once had
&s;at with her father and Valancourt, re&s;ting
upon a cliff of the Pyren&eacute;es, &s;he heard
from below the long-drawn notes of a vio|lin,
of &s;uch tone and delicacy of expre&s;&s;ion,
as harmonized exactly with the tender
emotions &s;he was indulging, and both
charmed and &s;urprised her. Cavigni, who
approached the window, &s;miled at her
&s;urpri&s;e. &startq;This is nothing extraordinary,&endq;
&s;aid he, &startq;you will hear the &s;ame, perhaps,
at every inn on our way. It is one of our
landlord's family who plays, I doubt not.&endq;
<PB N="21" REF="23">
Emily, as &s;he li&s;tened, thought he could be
&s;carcely le&s;&s; than a profe&s;&s;or of mu&s;ic
whom &s;he heard; and the &s;weet and plain|tive
&s;trains &s;oon lulled her into a reverie,
from which &s;he was very unwillingly rou&s;ed
by the raillery of Cavigni, and by the voice
of Montoni, who gave orders to a &s;ervant to
have the carriages ready at an early hour
on the following morning; and added,
that he meant to dine at Turin.</P>
<P>Madame Montoni was exceedingly re|joiced
to be once more on level ground;
and, after giving a long detail of the vari|ous
terrors &s;he had &s;uffered, which &s;he for|got
that &s;he was de&s;cribing to the compa|nions
of her dangers, &s;he added a hope, that
&s;he &s;hould &amp; soon be beyond the view of the&s;e
horrid mountains, &startq;which all the world,&endq;
&s;aid &s;he, &startq;&s;hould not tempt me to cro&s;s
again.&endq; Complaining of fatigue &s;he &s;oon
retired to re&s;t, and Emily withdrew to her
own room, when &s;he understood from An|nette,
her aunt's woman, that Cavigni was
nearly right in his conjecture concerning
<PB N="22" REF="24">
the mu&s;ician, who had awakened the violin
with &s;o much ta&s;te, for that he was the &s;on
of a pea&s;ant, inhabiting the neighbouring
valley, &startq;He is going to the Carnival at
Venice,&endq; added Annette, &startq;for they &s;ay he
has a fine hand at playing, and will get a
world of money; and the Carnival is ju&s;t
going to begin: but for my part, I &s;hould
like to live among the&s;e plea&s;ant woods and
hills, better than in a town; and they &s;ay
Ma'moi&s;elle, we &s;hall &s;ee no woods, or hills,
or fields, at Venice, for that it is built in
the very middle of the &s;ea.&endq;</P>
<P>Emily agreed with the talkative Annette,
that this young man was making a change
for the wor&s;e, and could not for bear silently
lamenting, that he &s;hould be drawn from
the innocence and beauty of the&s;e &s;cenes,
to the corrupt ones of the voluptuous
city.</P>
<P>When &s;he was alone, unable to &s;leep, the
land&s;capes of her native home, with Valan|court,
and the circum&s;tances of her depar|ture,
haunted her fancy; &s;he drew pictures
<PB N="23" REF="25">
of &s;ocial happine&s;s amid&s;t the grand &s;impli|city
of nature, &s;uch as &s;he feared &s;he had
bade farewel to for ever; and then, the idea
of this young Piedmonte&s;e, thus ignorantly
&s;porting with his happine&s;s, returned to her
thoughts, and, glad to e&s;cape awhile from
the pre&s;&s;ure of nearer intere&s;ts, &s;he indulged
her fancy in composing the following lines.</P>

<P>EARLY on the following morning, the
travellers &s;et out for Turin. The luxu|riant
plain, that extends from the feet of
the Alps to that magnificent city, was not
then, as now, &s;haded by an avenue of trees
nine miles in length; but plantations of
olives, mulberry and palms, fe&s;tooned with
vines, mingled with the pastoral &s;cenery,
through which the rapid Po, after its de|&s;cent
from the mountains, wandered to meet
the humble Doria at Turin. As they ad|vanced
towards this city, the Alps, &s;een at
&s;ome di&s;tance, began to appear in all their
awful &s;ublimity; chain ri&s;ing over chain
<PB N="26" REF="28">
in long &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, their higher points dark|ened
by the hovering clouds, &s;ometimes
hid, and at others &s;een &s;hooting up far above
them; while their lower &s;teeps, broken into
fanta&s;tic forms, were touched with blue and
purpli&s;h tints, which, as they changed in
light and &s;hade, &s;eemed to open new &s;cenes
to the eye. To the ea&s;t &s;tretched the plains
of Lombardy, with the towers of Turin
ri&s;ing at a di&s;tance; and beyond, the Apen|nines,
bounding the horizon.</P>
<P>The general magnificence of that city,
with its vi&s;tas of churches and palaces,
branching from the grand &s;quare, each
opening to a land&s;cape of the di&s;tant Alps
or Apennines, was not only &s;uch as Emily
had never &s;een in France, but &s;uch as &s;he
had never imagined.</P>
<P>Montoni, who had been often at Turin,
and cared little about views of any kind,
did not comply with his wife's reque&s;t,
that they might &s;urvey &s;ome of the palaces;
but &s;taying only till the nece&s;&s;ary refre&s;h|ments
could be obtained, they &s;et forward
<PB N="27" REF="29">
for Venice with all po&s;sible rapidity. Mon|toni's
manner, during this journey, was
grave, and even haughty; and towards Ma|dame
Montoni he was more e&s;pecially re|&s;erved;
but it was not the re&s;erve of re&s;pec$
&s;o much as of pride and di&s;content. Of
Emily he took little notice. With Cavigni
his conver&s;ations were commonly on politi|cal
or military topics, &s;uch as the convul&s;ed
&s;tate of their country rendered at this time
particularly intere&s;ting. Emily ob&s;erved,
that, at the mention of any daring exploit,
Montoni's eyes lo&s;t their &s;ullenne&s;s, and
&s;eemed in&s;tantaneou&s;ly to gleam, with fire;
yet they &s;till retained &s;omewhat of a lurking
cunning, and &s;he &s;ometimes thought that
their fire partook more of the glare of malice
than the brightne&s;s of valour, though the
latter would well have harmonized with the
high chivalric air of his figure, in which
Cavigni, with all his gay and gallant man|ners,
was his inferi$r.</P>
<P>On entering the Milane&s;e, the gentle|men
exchanged their French hats for the
<PB N="28" REF="30">
Italian cap of &s;carlet cloth, embroidered;
and Emily was &s;omewhat &s;urpri&s;ed to ob|&s;erve,
that Montoni added to his the mili|tary
plume, while Cavigni retained only the
feather: which was u&s;ually worn with &s;uch
caps: but &s;he at length concluded, that
Montoni a&s;&s;umed this en&s;ign of a &s;oldier
for convenience, as a means of pa&s;&s;ing with
more &s;afety through a country over-run
with parties of the military.</P>
<P>Over the beautiful plains of this country
the deva&s;tations of war were frequently vi&s;i|ble.
Where the lands had not been &s;uffered
to lie uncultivated, they were often tracked
with the &s;teps of the &s;poiler; the vines were
torn down from the branches that had &s;up|ported
them, the olives trampled upon the
ground, and even the groves of mulberry
trees had been hewn by the enemy to light
fires that de&s;troyed the hamlets and villages
of their owners. Emily turned her eyes
with a &s;igh from the&s;e painful ve&s;tiges of
contention, to the Alps of the Gri&s;on,
that overlooked them to the north, who&s;e
<PB N="29" REF="31">
awful &s;olitudes &s;eemed to offer to per&s;ecuted
man a &s;ecure a&s;ylum.</P>
<P>The travellers frequently di&s;tingui&s;hed
troops of &s;oldiers moving at a di&s;tance;
and they experienced, at the little inns on
the road, the &s;carcity of provi&s;ion and
other inconveniencies, which are a part of
the con&s;equence of inte&s;tine war; but they
had never rea&s;on to be much alarmed for
their immediate &s;afety, and they pa&s;&s;ed on
to Milan with little interruption of any
kind, where they &s;taid not to &s;urvey the
grandeur of the city, or even to view its
va&s;t cathedral, which was then building.</P>
<P>Beyond Milan, the country wore the
a&s;pect of a ruder deva&s;tation; and though
every thing &s;eemed now quiet, the repo&s;e
was like that of death, &s;pread over features,
which retain the impre&s;&s;ion of the la&s;t con|vul&s;ions.</P>
<P>It was not till they had pa&s;&s;ed the ea&s;tern
limits of the Milane&s;e, that the travellers
&s;aw any troops &s;ince they had left Milan,
when, as the evening was drawing to a
<PB N="30" REF="32">
clo&s;e, they de&s;cried what appeared to be an
army winding onward along the di&s;tant
plains, who&s;e &s;pears and other arms caught
the la&s;t rays of the &s;un. As the column
advanced through a part of the road, con|tracted
between two hillocks, &s;ome of the
commanders, on hor&s;eback, were di&s;tin|gui&s;hed
on a &s;mall eminence, pointing and
making &s;ignals for the march; while &s;eve|ral
of the officers were riding along the
line directing its progre&s;s, according to the
&s;igns communicated by tho&s;e above; and
others, &s;eparating from the vanguard, which
had emerged from the pa&s;s, were riding
carele&s;&s;ly along the plains, at &s;ome di&s;tance
to the right of the army.</P>
<P>As they drew nearer, Montoni, di&s;tin|gui&s;hing
the feathers that waved in their
caps, and the banners and liveries of the
bands that followed them, thought he knew
this to be the &s;mall army commanded by
the famous captain Utaldo, with whom,
as well as with &s;ome of the other chiefs,
he was per&s;onally acquainted. He, there|fore
<PB N="31" REF="33">
gave orders that the carriages &s;hould
draw up by the &s;ide of the road, to await
their arrival, and give them the pa&s;s. A
faint &s;train of martial mu&s;ic now &s;tole by,
and, gradually &s;trengthening as the troops
approached, Emily di&s;tingui&s;hed the drums
and trumpets, with the cla&s;h of cymbals and
of arms, that were &s;truck by a &s;mall party,
in time to the march.</P>
<P>Montoni being now certain that the&s;e
were the bands of the victorious Utaldo,
leaned from the carriage window, and
hailed their general by waving his cap in
the air; which compliment the chief re|turned
by rai&s;ing his &s;pear, and then letting
it down again &s;uddenly, while &s;ome of his
officers, who were riding at a di&s;tance from
the troops, came up to the carriage, and
&s;aluted Montoni as an old acquaintance.
The captain him&s;elf &s;oon after arriving, his
bands halted while he conver&s;ed with
Montoni, whom he appeared much re|joiced
to &s;ee and from what he &s;aid, Emily
<PB N="32" REF="34">
under&s;tood that this was a victorious army,
r&eacute;turning into their own principality; while
the numerous waggons, that accompanied
them, contained the rich &s;poils of the ene|my,
their own wounded &s;oldiers, and the
pri&s;oners they had taken in battle, who were
to be ran&s;omed when the peace, then ne|gociating
between the neighbouring &s;tates,
&s;hould be ratified. The chiefs on the fol|lowing
day were to &s;eparate, and each,
taking his &s;hare of the &s;poil, was to return
with his own band to his ca&s;tle. This was
therefore to be an evening of uncommon
and general fe&s;tivity, in commemoration
of the victory they had accompli&s;hed
together, and of the farewell which the
commanders were about to take of each
other.</P>
<P>Emily, as the&s;e officers conver&s;ed with
Montoni, ob&s;erved with admiration, tinc|tured
with awe, their high martial air,
mingled with the haughtine&s;s of the no|ble&s;&s;e
of tho&s;e days, and heightened by the
<PB N="33" REF="35">
gallantry of their dre&s;s, by the plumes
towering on their caps, the armorial coat,
Per&s;ian &s;a&s;h, and ancient Spani&s;h cloak.
Utaldo telling Montoni that his army were
going to encamp for the night near a village
at only a few miles di&s;tance, invited him.
to turn back and partake of their fe&s;tivity,
a&s;&s;uring the ladies al&s;o, that they &s;hould be
plea&s;antly accommodated; but Montoni
excu&s;ed him&s;elf, adding, that it was his de|&s;ign
to reach Verona that evening; and, af|ter
&s;ome conver&s;ation concerning the &s;tate of
the country towards that city, they parted.</P>
<P>The travellers proceeded without any in|terruption;
but it was &s;ome hours after &s;un|&s;et
before they arrived at Verona, who&s;e
beautiful environs were therefore not &s;een
by Emily till the following morning; when,
leaving that plea&s;ant town at an early hour,
they &s;et off for Padua, where they em|barked
on the Brenta for Venice. Here
the &s;cene was entirely changed; no ve&s;tiges
of war, &s;uch as had deformed the plains of
the Milane&s;e, appeared; on the contrary,
<PB N="34" REF="36">
all was peace and elegance. The verdant
banks of the Brenta exhibited a continued
land&s;cape of beauty, gaiety, and &s;plendour.
Emily gazed with admiration on the villas
of the Venetian noble&s;&s;e, with their cool
porticos and colonnades, overhung with
poplars and cypre&s;&s;es of maje&s;tic height
and lively verdure; on their rich orangeries,
who&s;e blo&s;&s;oms perfumed the air, and on
the luxuriant willows, that dipped their
light leaves in the wave, and &s;heltered from
the fun the gay parties who&s;e mu&s;ic came
at intervals on the breeze. The Carnival
did, indeed, appear to extend from Venice
along the whole line of the&s;e enchanting
&s;hores; the river was gay with boats pa&s;&s;|ing
to that city, exhibiting the fanta&s;tic
diver&s;ity of a ma&s;querade in the dre&s;&s;es
of the people within them; and, towards
evening, groups of dancers frequently
were &s;een beneath the trees.</P>
<P>Cavigni, meanwhile, informed her of the
names of the noblemen to whom the &s;eve|ral
villas they pa&s;&s;ed belonged, adding light
<PB N="35" REF="37">
&s;ketches of their characters, &s;uch as &s;erved
to amu&s;e rather than to inform, exhibiting
his own wit in&s;tead of the delineation of
truth. Emily was &s;ometimes diverted by
his conver&s;ation; but his gaiety did not
entertain Madame Montoni, as it had for|merly
dOne; &s;he was frequently grave, and
Montoni retained his u&s;ual re&s;erve.</P>
<P>Nothing could exceed Emily's admira|tion,
on her fir&s;t view of Venice, with its
i&s;lets, palaces, and towers ri&s;ing out of the
&s;ea, who&s;e clear &s;urface reflected the tremu|lous
picture in all its colours. The fun,
&s;inking in the we&s;t, tinted the waves and
the lofty mountains of Friuli, which &s;kirt
the northern &s;hores of the Adriatic, with a
&s;affron glow, while on the marble porticos
and colonnades of St. Mark were thrown
the rich lights and &s;hades of evening. As
they glided on, the grander features of this
city appeared more di&s;tinctly: its terraces,
crowned with airy yet maje&s;tic fabrics,
touched, as they now were, with the &s;plen|dour
of the &s;etting &s;un, appeared as if they
<PB N="36" REF="38">
had been called up from the ocean by the
wand of an enchanter, rather than reared by
mortal hands.</P>
<P>The &s;un, &s;oon after, &s;inking to the lower
world, the &s;hadow of the earth &s;tole gradu|ally
over the waves, and then up the tower|ing
&s;ides of the mountains of Friuli, till it
extingui&s;hed even the la&s;t upward beams
that had lingered on their fummits, and
the melancholy purple of evening drew over
them, like a thin veil. How deep, how
beautiful was the tranquillity that wrapped
the &s;cene! All nature &s;eemed to repo&s;e; the
fine&s;t emotions of the foul were alone awake.
Emily's eyes filled with tears of admira|tion
and &s;ublime devotion, as &s;he rai&s;ed
them over the &s;leeping world to the va&s;t
heavens, and heard the notes of &s;olemn
mu&s;ic, that &s;tole over the waters from a
di&s;tance. She li&s;tened in &s;till rapture, and
no per&s;on of the party broke the charm by
an enquiry, The &s;ounds &s;eemed to grow
on the air; for &s;o &s;moothly did the barge
glide along, that its motion was not per|ceivable,
<PB N="37" REF="39">
and the fairy city appeared ap|proaching
to welcome the &s;trangers. They
now di&s;tingui&s;hed a female voice, accom|panied
by a few instruments, &s;inging a &s;oft
and mournful air; and its fine expre&s;&s;ion,
as &s;ometimes it &s;eemed pleading with the
impa&s;&s;ioned tenderne&s;s of love, and then
langui&s;hing into the cadence of hopele&s;s
grief, declared, that it flowed from no
feigned &s;en&s;ibility. Ah! thought Emily,
as &s;he &s;ighed and remembered Valancourt,
tho&s;e &s;trains come from the heart!</P>
<P>She looked round, with anxious enquiry;
the deep twilight, that had fallen over the
&s;cene, admitted only imperfect images to
the eye, but, at &s;ome di&s;tance on the &s;ea, &s;he
thought &s;he perceived a gondola: a chorus
of voices and in&s;truments now &s;welled on
the air&mdash;&s;o &s;weet, &s;o &s;olemn! it &s;eemed like
the hymn of angels de&s;cending through the
&s;ilence of night! Now it died away, and
fancy almo&s;t beheld the holy choir re|a&s;cending
towards heaven; then again it
&s;welled with the breeze, trembled awhile,
<PB N="38" REF="40">
and again died into &s;ilence. It brought to
Emily's recollection &s;ome lines of her late
father, and &s;he repeated in a low voice,
<Q><L>&mdash;Oft I hear,</L>
<L>Upon the &s;ilence of the midnight air,</L>
<L>Cele&s;tial voices &s;well in holy chorus</L>
<L>That bears the &s;oul to heaven!</L></Q></P>
<P>The deep &s;tillne&s;s, that &s;ucceeded, was as
expre&s;&s;ive as the &s;train that had ju&s;t cea&s;ed.
It was uninterrupted for &s;everal minutes, till
a general &s;igh &s;eemed to relea&s;e the company
from their enchantment. Emily, however,
long indulged the plea&s;ing &s;adne&s;s, that
had &s;tolen upon her &s;pirits; but the gay
and bu&s;y &s;cene that appeared, as the barge
approached St. Mark's Place, at length
rou&s;ed her attention. The ri&s;ing moon,
which threw a &s;hadowy light upon the ter|races,
and illumined the porticos and mag|nificent
arcades that crowned them, di&s;|covered
the various company, who&s;e light
&s;teps, &s;oft guitars, and &s;ofter voices, echoed
through the colonnades.</P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="41">
The mu&s;ic they heard before now pa&s;&s;ed
Montoni's barge, in one of the gondolas,
of which &s;everal were &s;een &s;kimming along
the moon-light &s;ea, full of gay parties
catching the cool breeze. Mo&s;t of the&s;e
had mu&s;ic, made &s;weeter by the waves over
which it floated, and by the mea&s;ured
&s;ound of oars, as they da&s;hed the &s;parkling
tide. Emily gazed, and li&s;tened, and
thought her&s;elf in a fairy &s;cene; even Ma|dame
Montoni was plea&s;ed; Montoni con|gratulated
him&s;elf on his return to Venice,
which he called the fir&s;t city in the world,
and Cavigni was more gay and animated
than ever.</P>
<P>The barge pa&s;&s;ed on to the grand canal,
where Montoni's man&s;ion was &s;ituated.
And here, other forms of beauty and of
grandeur, &s;uch as her imagination had ne|ver
painted, were unfolded to Emily in
the palaces of San&s;vino and Palladio,
as &s;he glided along the waves. The air
bore no &s;ounds, but tho&s;e of &s;weetne&s;s,
echoing along each margin of the canal,
<PB N="40" REF="42">
and from gondolas on its &s;urface, while
groups of ma&s;ks were &s;een dancing on
the moonlight terraces, and &s;eemed almo&s;t
to realize the romance of fairy-land.</P>
<P>The barge &s;topped before the portico of
a large hou&s;e, from whence a &s;ervant of
Montoni cro&s;&s;ed the terrace, and imme|diately
the party di&s;embarked. From the
portico they pa&s;&s;ed a noble hall to a &s;tair|ca&s;e
of marble, which led to a &s;aloon, fitted
Up in a &s;tyle of magnificence That &s;urpri&s;ed
Emily. The walls and ceiling were adorned
with hi&s;torical and allegorical paintings,
in <HI>fre&s;co;</HI> &s;ilver tripods, depending from
chains of the &s;ame metal, illumined the
apartment, the floor of which was covered
with Indian mats painted in a variety of
colours and devices; the couches and dra|pery
of the lattices were of pale green &s;ilk,
embroidered and fringed with green and
gold. Balcony lattices opened upon the
grand canal, whence ro&s;e a confu&s;ion of
voices and of mu&s;ical in&s;truments, and the
breeze that gave fre&s;hne&s;s to the apartment.
<PB N="41" REF="43">
Emily, con&s;idering the gloomy temper of
Montoni, looked upon the &s;plendid furni|ture
of his hou&s;e with &s;urpri&s;e, and
remembered the report of his being a man of
broken fortune, with a&s;toni&s;hment. &startq;Ah!&endq;
&s;aid &s;he to her&s;elf, &startq;if Valancourt could
but &s;ee this man&s;ion, what peace would it
give him! He would then be convinced
that the report was groundle&s;s.&endq;</P>
<P>Madame Montoni &s;eemed to a&s;&s;ume the
airs of a prince&s;s; but Montoni was re&s;t|le&s;s
and di&s;contented, and did not even ob|&s;erve
the civility of bidding her welcome
to her home.</P>
<P>Soon after his arrival, he ordered his gon|dola,
and, with Cavigni, went out to mingle
in the &s;cenes of the evening. Madame
then became &s;erious and thoughtful. Emily,
who was charmed with every thing &s;he &s;aw,
endeavoured to enliven her; but reflection
had not, with Madame Montoni, &s;ubdued
caprice and ill-humour, and her an&s;wers
di&s;covered &s;o much of both, that Emily
gave up the attempt of diverting her, and
<PB N="42" REF="44">
withdrew to a lattice, to amu&s;e her&s;elf
with the &s;cene without, &s;o new and &s;o en|chanting.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t object that attracted her notice
was a group of dancers on the terrace be|low,
led by a guitar, and &s;ome other in|&s;truments.
The girl, who &s;truck the gui|tar,
and another, who flouri&s;hed a tambo|rine,
pa&s;&s;ed on in a dancing &s;tep, and with
a light grace and gaiety of heart, that Would
have &s;ubdued the godde&s;s of &s;pleen in her
wor&s;t humour. After the&s;e came a group
of fanta&s;tic figures, &s;ome dre&s;&s;ed as gondo|lieri,
others as minstrels, while others &s;eemed
to defy all de&s;cription. They &s;ung in parts,
their voices accompanied by a few &s;oft in|&s;truments.
At a little di&s;tance from the
portico they &s;topped, and Emily di&s;tin|gui&s;hed
the ver&s;es of Ario&s;to. They &s;ung
of the wars of the Moors again&s;t Charle|magne,
and then of the woes of Orlando:
afterwards the mea&s;ure changed, and the
melancholy &s;weetne&s;s of Petrarch &s;ucceeded.
The magic of his grief was a&s;&s;i&s;ted by all
<PB N="43" REF="45">
that Italian mu&s;ic and Italian expre&s;&s;ion,
heightened by the enchantments of Vene|tian
moonlight, could give.</P>
<P>Emily, as &s;he li&s;tened, caught the pen&s;ive
enthu&s;ia&s;m; her tears flowed &s;ilently, while
her fancy bore her far away to France and
to Valancourt. Each &s;ucceeding &s;onnet,
more full of charming &s;adne&s;s than the la&s;t,
&s;eemed to bind the &s;pell of melancholy:
with extreme regret &s;he &s;aw the mu&s;icians
move on, and her attention followed the
&s;train till the la&s;t faint warble died in air.
She then remained &s;unk in that pen&s;ive
tranquillity which &s;oft mu&s;ic leaves on the
mind&mdash;a &s;tate like that produced by the
view of a beautiful land&s;cape by moon|light,
or by the recollection of &s;cenes
marked with the tenderne&s;s of friends lo&s;t
for ever, and with &s;orrows, which time has
mellowed into mild regret. Such &s;cenes
are indeed, to the mind, like &startq;tho&s;e faint
traces which the memory bears of mu&s;ic
that is pa&s;t.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="46">
Other &s;ounds &s;oon awakened her atten|tion:
it was the &s;olemn harmony of horns,
that &s;welled from a di&s;tance; and, ob&s;erving
the gondolas arrange them&s;elves along the
margin of the terraces, &s;he threw on her veil,
and, &s;tepping into the balcony, di&s;cerned,
in the di&s;tant per&s;pective of the canal,
&s;omething like a proce&s;&s;ion, floating on the
light &s;urface of the water: as it approached,
the horns and other in&s;truments mingled
&s;weetly, and &s;oon after the fabled deities of
the city &s;eemed to have ari&s;en from the
ocean; for Neptune, with Venice per&s;oni|fied
as his queen, came on the undulating
waves, &s;urrounded by tritons and &s;ea|nymphs.
The fanta&s;tic &s;plendour of this
&s;pectacle, together with the grandeur of the
&s;urrounding palaces, appeared like the vi|&s;ion
of a poet &s;uddenly embodied, and the
fanciful images, which it awakened in
Emily's mind, lingered there long after the
proce&s;&s;ion had pa&s;&s;ed away. She indulged
her&s;elf in imagining what might be the
<PB N="45" REF="47">
manners and delights of a &s;ea-nymph, till
&s;he almo&s;t wi&s;hed to throw off the habit of
mortality, and plunge into the green wave
to participate them.</P>
<P>&startq;How delightful,&endq; &s;aid &s;he, &startq;to live
amid&s;t the coral bowers and cry&s;tal caverns
of the ocean, with my &s;i&s;ter nymphs, and
li&s;ten to the &s;ounding waters above, and to
the &s;oft &s;hells of the tritons! and then,
after &s;un-&s;et, to &s;kim on the &s;urface of the
waves round wild rocks and along &s;eque&s;|tered
&s;hores, where, perhaps, &s;ome pen&s;ive
wanderer comes to weep! Then would I
&s;ooth his &s;orrows with my &s;weet mu&s;ic,
and offer him from a &s;hell &s;ome of the de|licious
fruit that hangs round Neptune's
palace.&endq;</P>
<P>She was recalled from her reverie to a
mere mortal &s;upper, and could not forbear
&s;miling at the fancies &s;he had been indulg|ing,
and at her conviction of the &s;erious
di&s;plea&s;ure, which Madame Montoni would
have expre&s;&s;ed, could &s;he have been made
acquainted with them.</P>
<P><PB N="46" REF="48">
After &s;upper, her aunt &s;at late but Montoni
did not return, and &s;he at length retired to
re&s;t. If Emily had admired the magnificence
of the &s;aloon, &s;he was not le&s;s &s;urpri&s;ed,
on ob&s;erving the half-furni&s;hed and forlorn
appearance of the apartments &s;he pa&s;&s;ed in
the way to her chamber, whither &s;he went
through long &s;uites of noble rooms, that
&s;eemed, from their de&s;olate a&s;pect, to have
been unoccupied for many years. On the
walls of &s;ome were the faded remains of ta|pe&s;try;
from others, painted in <HI>fre&s;co,</HI> the
damps had almo&s;t withdrawn both co|lours
and de&s;ign. At length &s;he reached
her own chamber, &s;pacious, de&s;olate, and
lofty, like the re&s;t, with high lattices that
opened towards the Adriatic. It brought
gloomy images to her mind, but the view of
the Adriatic &s;oon gave her others more airy,
among which was that of the &s;ea-nymph,
who&s;e delights &s;he had before amu&s;ed her|&s;elf
with picturing; and, anxious to e&s;cape
from &s;erious reflections, &s;he now endea|voured
to throw her fanciful ideas into a

<P>MONTONI and his companion did not
return home, till many hours after the dawn
had blu&s;hed upon the Adriatic. The airy
groups, which had danced all night along
the colonnade of St. Mark, di&s;per&s;ed before
the morning, like &s;o many &s;pirits. Mon|toni
had been otherwi&s;e engaged; his &s;oul
was little &s;u&s;ceptible of light plea&s;ures.
He delighted in the energies of the pa&s;&s;ions;
the difficulties and tempe&s;ts of life, which
<PB N="53" REF="55">
wreck the happine&s;s of others, rou&s;ed and
&s;trengthened all the powers of his mind,
and afforded him the highe&s;t enjoyments,
of which his nature was capable. With|out
&s;ome object of &s;trong intere&s;t, life
was to him little more than a &s;leep; and,
when pur&s;uits of real intere&s;t failed, he
&s;ub&s;tituted artificial ones, till habit chang|ed
their nature, and they cea&s;ed to be
unreal. Of this kind was the habit of
gaming, which he had adopted, fir&s;t,
for the purpo&s;e of relieving him from the
languor of inaction, but had &s;ince pur&s;ued
with the ardour of pa&s;&s;ion. In this occu|pation
he had pa&s;&s;ed the night with Ca|vigni
and a party of young men, who had
more money than rank, and more vice than
either. Montoni de&s;pi&s;ed the greater part
of the&s;e for the inferiority of their talents,
rather than for their vicious inclinations,
and a&s;&s;ociated with them only to make
them the in&s;truments of his purpo&s;es.
Among the&s;e, however, were &s;ome of &s;upe|rior
abilities, and a few whom Montoni
<PB N="54" REF="56">
admitted to his intimacy, but even towards
the&s;e he &s;till pre&s;erved a deci&s;ive and haughty
air, which, while it impo&s;ed &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion on
weak and timid minds, rou&s;ed the fierce
hatred of &s;trong ones. He had, of cour&s;e,
many and bitter enemies; but the rancour
of their hatred proved the degree of his
power; and, as power was his chief aim,
he gloried more in &s;uch hatred, than it was
po&s;&s;ible he could in being e&s;teemed. A
feeling &s;o tempered as that of e&s;teem, he
de&s;pi&s;ed, and would have de&s;pi&s;ed him&s;elf
al&s;o had he thought him&s;elf capable of be|ing
flattered by it.</P>
<P>Among the few whom he di&s;tingui&s;hed,
were the Signors Bertolini, Or&s;ino, and Ve|rezzi.
The fir&s;t was a man of a gay temper,
&s;trong pa&s;&s;ions, di&s;&s;ipated, and of unbound|ed
extravagance, but generous, brave, and
un&s;u&s;picious. Or&s;ino was re&s;erved, and
haughty; loving power more than o&s;tenta|tion;
of a cruel and &s;u&s;picious temper;
quick to feel an injury, and relentle&s;s in
avenging it; cunning and un&s;earchable in
<PB N="55" REF="57">
contrivance, patient and indefatigable in
the execution of his &s;chemes. He had a
perfect command of feature and of his
pa&s;&s;ion, of which he had &s;carcely any, but
pride, revenge and avarice; and, in the
gratification of the&s;e, few considerations had
power to re&s;train him, few ob&s;tacles to
with&s;tand the depth of his &s;tratagems. This
man was the chief favourite of Montoni.
Verezzi was a man of &s;ome talent, of fiery
imagination, and the &s;lave of alternate
pa&s;&s;ions. He was gay, voluptuous, and
daring; yet had neither per&s;everance or
true courage, and was meanly &s;elfi&s;h in all
his aims. Quick to form &s;chemes, and &s;an|guine
in his hope of &s;ucce&s;s, he was the fir&s;t
to undertake, and to ab&agrave;ndon, not only his
own plans, but tho&s;e adopted from other
per&s;ons. Proud and impetuous, he revolted
again&s;t all &s;ubordination; yet tho&s;e who
were acquainted with his character, and
watched the turn of his pa&s;&s;ions, could lead
him like a child.</P>
<P><PB N="56" REF="58">
Such were the friends whom Montoni in|troduced
to his family and his table, on the
day after his arrival at Venice. There were
al&s;o of the party a Venetian nobleman,
Count Morano, and a Signora Livona,
whom Montoni had introduced to his wife,
as a lady of di&s;tingui&s;hed merit, and who,
having called in the morning to welcome
her to Venice, had been reque&s;ted to be
of the dinner party.</P>
<P>Madame Montoni received, with a very
ill grace, the compliments of the Signors.
She di&s;liked them, becau&s;e they were the
friends of her hu&s;band; hated them, becau&s;e
&s;he believed they had contributed to detain
him abroad till &s;o late an hour of the
preceding morning; and envied them, &s;ince,
con&s;cious of her own want of influence, &s;he
was convinced, that he preferred their &s;ociety
to her own. The rank of Count Morano pro|cured
him that di&s;tinction which &s;he refu&s;|ed
to the re&s;t of the company. The haughty
sullenne&s;s of her countenance and manner,
<PB N="57" REF="59">
and the o&s;tentatious extravagance of her
dre&s;s, for &s;he had not yet adopted the Vene|tian
habit, were &s;trikingly contra&s;ted by the
beauty, mode&s;ty, &s;weetne&s;s and &s;implicity
of Emily, who ob&s;erved, with more atten|tion
than plea&s;ure, the party around her.
The beauty and fa&s;cinating manners of
Signora Livona, however, won her invo|luntary
regard; while the &s;weetne&s;s of her
accents and her air of gentle kindne&s;s
awakened with Emily tho&s;e plea&s;ing affec|tions,
which &s;o long had &s;lumbered.</P>
<P>In the cool of the evening the par$y em|barked
in Montoni's gondola, and rowed
out upon the &s;ea. The red glow of &s;un|&s;et
&s;till touched the waves, and lingered in
the we&s;t, where the melancholy gleam
&s;eemed &s;lowly expiring, while the dark blue
of the upper aether began to twinkle with
&s;tars. Emily &s;at, given up to pen&s;ive and
&s;weet emotions. The &s;moothne&s;s of
the water, over which &s;he glided, its reflected
images&mdash;a new heaven and trembling &s;tars
below the waves, with &s;hadowy outlines of
<PB N="58" REF="60">
towers and porticos, con&s;pired with the
&s;tillne&s;s of the hour, interrupted only by
the pa&s;&s;ing wave, or the notes of di&s;tant
mu&s;ic, to rai&s;e tho&s;e emotions to enthu&s;ia&s;m.
As &s;he li&s;tened to the mea&s;ured &s;ound of the
oars, and to the remote warblings that came
in the breeze, her &s;oftened mind returned
to the memory of St. Aubert and to Valan|court,
and tears &s;tole to her eyes.
The rays of the moon, &s;trengthening as the &s;ha|dows
deepened, &s;oon after threw a &s;ilvery
gleam upon her countenance, which was
partly &s;haded by a thin black veil, and
touched in with inimitable &s;oftne&s;s. Hers
was the <HI>contour</HI> of a Madona, with the
&s;en&s;ibility of a Magdalen; and the pen&s;ive
uplifted eye, with the tear that glittered on
her cheek, confirmed the expre&s;&s;ion of the
character.</P>
<P>The la&s;t &s;train of di&s;tant mu&s;ic now died
in air, for the gondola was far upon the
waves, and the party determined to have
mu&s;ic of their own. The Count Morano,
who &s;at next to Emily, and who had been

<P>The cadence with which he returned
from the la&s;t &s;tanza to a pepetition of the
fir&s;t; the fine modulation in which his
voice &s;tole upon the fir&s;t line, and the pa|thetic
enrgy with which it pronounced the
la&s;t, were &s;uch as only exqui&s;ite ta&s;te could
give. When he had concluded, he gave
the lute with a &s;igh to Emily, who, to avoid
any appearance of affectation, immediately
began to play. she &s;ung a melancholy
little air, one of the popular &s;ongs of her
native province, with a &s;implicity and pa|thos
that made it enchanting. But its
well-known melody brought &s;o forcibly to
her fancy the &s;cenes and the per&s;ons, among
<PB N="61" REF="63">
which &s;he had often heard it, that her &s;pi|rits
were overcome, her voice trembled and
cea&s;ed&mdash;and the &s;trings of the lute were
&s;truck with a di&s;ordered hand; till, a&s;hamed
of the emotion &s;he betrayed, &s;he &s;ud|denly
pa&s;&s;ed on to a &s;ong &s;o gay and ariy,
that the &s;teps of the dance &s;eemed almo&s;t
to echo to the notes. <HI>Bravi&s;&s;imo!</HI>
bur&s;t in&s;tantly from the lips of her delighted
auditors, and &s;he was compelled to repeat
the air. Among the compliments that fol|lowed,
tho&s;e of the Count were not the lea&s;t
audible, and they had not concluded,
when Emily gave the in&s;trument to Signora
Livona, who&s;e voice accompanied it with
true Italian ta&s;te.</P>
<P>Afterwards the Count, Emily, Cavigni,
and the Signora, &s;ung <HI>canzonettes,</HI> accom|panied
by a couple of lutes and a few other
in&s;truments. sometimes the in&s;truments
&s;uddenly cea&s;ed, and the voices dropped
from the full &s;well of harmony into a low
chant; then, after a deep pau&s;e, they ro&s;e
by degrees, the in&s;truments one by one
<PB N="62" REF="64">
&s;triking up, till the loud and full chorus
foared again to heaven!</P>
<P>Meanwhile, Montoni, who was weary of
this harmony, was con&s;idering how he
might di&s;engage him&s;elf from his party,
or withdraw with &s;uch of it as would be
willing to play, to a Ca&s;ino. In a pau&s;e of
the mu&s;ic, he propo&s;ed returning to &s;hore,
but which the Count and the other gentle|men
as warmly oppo&s;ed.</P>
<P>Montoni &s;till meditated how he might
excu&s;e him&s;elf from longer attendance upon
the Count, for to him only he thought ex|cu&s;e
nece&s;&s;ary, and how he might get to
land, till the gondolieri of an empty boat,
returning to Venice, hailed his people.
Without troubling him&s;elf logner about
an excu&s;e, he &s;eized this opportunity of
going thither, and, committing the ladies to
the care of his friends, departed with Or|&s;ino,
while Emily, for the fir&s;t time, &s;aw
him go with regret; for &s;he con&s;idered
his pre&s;ence a protection, though &s;he knew
<PB N="63" REF="65">
not what &s;he &s;hould fear. He landed at
St. Mark's and, hurrying to a Ca&s;ino, was
&s;oon lo&s;t amid&s;t a crowd of game&s;ters.</P>
<P>Meanwhile, the Count having &s;ecretly
di&s;patched a &s;ervant in Montoni's boat, for
his own gondola and mu&s;icians, Emily
heard, without knowing his project, the
gay &s;ong of gondolieri approaching, as
they &s;at on teh &s;tern of the boat, and &s;aw
the tremulous gleam of the moon light
wave, which their oars di&s;turbed. Pre&s;ently
&s;he heard the &s;ound of in&s;truments, and
then a full &s;ymphony &s;welled on the air,
and, the boats meeting, the gondolieri hail|ed
each other. The Count then explaining
him&s;elf, the party removed into his gondola,
which was embelli&s;hed with all that ta&s;te
could be&s;tow.</P>
<P>While they partook of a collation of
fruits and ice, the whole band, follow|ing
at a di&s;tance, in the other boat,
played the mo&s;t &s;weet and enchanting
&s;trains, and the Count, who had again &s;eated
him&s;elf by Emily, paid her unremitted at|tention,
<PB N="64" REF="66">
and &s;ometimes, in a low but im|pa&s;&s;ioned
voice, uttered compliments which
&s;he could not mi&s;under&s;tand. To avoid
them &s;he conver&s;ed with Signora Livona,
and her manner to the Count a&s;&s;umed a
mild re&s;erve, which, though dignified, was
too gentle to repre&s;s his a&s;&s;iduities: he
could &s;ee, hear, &s;peak to no per&s;on, but
Emily, while Cavigni ob&s;erved him now
and then, with a look of di&s;plea&s;ure, and
Emily, with one of unea&s;ine&s;s. She now
wi&s;hed for nothing &s;o much as to return to
Venice, but it was near midnight before the
gondolas approached St. Mark's Place,
where the voice of gaiety and &s;ong was
loud. The bu&s;y hum of mingling &s;ounds
was heard at a con&s;iderable di&s;tance on the
water, and, had not a bright moon-light
di&s;covered the city, with its terraces and
towers, a &s;tranger would almo&s;t have
credited the fabled wonders of Neptune's
court, and believed, that the tumult aro&s;e
from beneath the waves.</P>
<P>They landed at St. Mark's, where the
<PB N="65" REF="67">
gai$ty of the colonnades and the beauty of
the night, made Madame Montoni willing|ly
&s;ubmit to the Count's &s;olicitations to join
the promenade, and afterwards to take a &s;up|per
with the re&s;t of the party, at his Ca&s;ino.
If any thing could have di&s;&s;ipated Emily's
unea&s;ine&s;s, it would have been the gran|deur,
gaiety, and novelty of the &s;urrounding
&s;cene, adorned with Palladio's palaces,
and bu&s;y with parties of ma&s;queraders.</P>
<P>At length they withdrew to the Ca&s;ino,
which was fitted up with infinite ta&s;te, and
where a &s;plendid banquet was prepared;
but here Emily's re&s;erve made the Count
perceive, that it was nece&s;&s;ary for his intere&s;t
to win the favour of Madame Montoni,
which, from the conde&s;cen&s;ion &s;he had al|ready
&s;hewn to him, appeared to be an
achievement of no great difficulty. He
transferred, therefore, part of his attention
from Emily to her aunt, who felt too much
flattered by the di&s;tinction even to di&s;gui&s;e
her emotion; and, before the party broke
up, he had entirely engaged the e&s;teem of
<PB N="66" REF="68">
Madame Montoni. Whenever he addre&s;&s;ed
her, her ungracious countenance relaxed
into &s;miles, and to whatever he propo&s;ed
&s;he a&s;&s;ented. He invited her, with the re&s;t
of the party, to take coffee, in his box at the
opera,, on the following evening, and Emily
heard the invitation accepted, with &s;trong
anxiety, concerning the means of excu&s;ing
her&s;elf from attending Madame Montoni thither.</P>
<P>It was very late before their gondola was
ordered, and Emily's &s;urpri&s;e was extreme,
when, on quitting the Ca&s;ino, &s;he beheld
the broad &s;un ri&s;ing out of the Adriatic,
while St. Mark's Place was yet crowded
with company. Sleep had long weighed
heavily on her eyes, but now the fre&s;h &s;ea|breeze
revived her, and &s;he would have
quitted the &s;cene with regret, had not the
Count been pre&s;ent, performing the duty,
which he had impo&s;ed upon him&s;elf, of
e&s;corting them home. There they heard
that Montoni was not yet returned; and
his wife, retiring in di&s;plea&s;ure to her apart|ment,
<PB N="67" REF="69">
at length relea&s;ed. Emily from the
fatigue of further attendance.</P>
<P>Montoni came home late in the morn|ing,
in a very ill humour, having lo&s;t con|siderably
at play, and, before he withdrew
to re&s;t, had a private conference with Ca|vigni,
who&s;e manner, on the following day,
&s;eemed to tell, that the &s;ubject of it had not
bee$ lea&s;ing to him.</P>
<P>In the $word$, Madame Montoni, who,
during the day, had ob&s;erved a fullen &s;ilence
towards, her husband, received visits from
&s;ome Venetian ladies, with who&s;e &s;weet
manners Emily was particularly charmed.
They had an air of ea&s;e and kindne&s;s to|wards
the &s;trangers, as if they had been their
familiar friends for years; and their con|ver&s;ation
was by turns tender, &s;entimental
and gay. Madame, though &s;he had no
ta&s;te for &s;uch conver&s;ations and who&s;e
coar&s;ene&s;s and &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s &s;ometimes exhi|bited
a ludicrous contra&s;t to their exce&s;&s;ive
refinement, could not remain wholly infen|&s;ible
to the captivations of their manner.</P>
<P><PB N="68" REF="70">
In a pau&s;e of conver&s;ation, a lady who
was called Signora Herminia took up a
lute, and began to play and &s;ing, with as
much ea&s;y gaiety, as if &s;he had been alone.
Her voice was uncommonly rich in tone,
and various in expre&s;&s;ion; yet &s;he appeared
to be entirely uncon&s;cious of its powers,
and meant nothing le&s;s than to di&s;play
them. She &s;ung from the gaiety $word$
heart, as &s;he &s;at with her veil $word$
back, holding gracefully the lute, under
the &s;preading foliage and flowers of &s;ome
plants, that ro&s;e from ba&s;kets, and inter|laced
one of the lattices of the &s;aloon.
Emily, retiring a little from the company,
&s;ketched her figure, with the miniature
&s;cenery around her, and drew a very in|tere&s;ting
picture, which, though it would
not, perhaps, have borne critici&s;m, had &s;pi|rit
and ta&s;te enough to awaken both the
fancy and the heart. When &s;he had fini&s;h|ed
it, &s;he pre&s;ented it to the beautiful ori|ginal,
who was delighted with the offering,
<PB N="69" REF="71">
as well as the &s;entiment it conveyed, and
a&s;&s;ured Emily, with a &s;mile of captivating
&s;weetne&s;s, that &s;he &s;hould pre&s;erve ita as a
pledge of her friend&s;hip.</P>
<P>In the evening Cavigni joined the ladies,
but Montoni had other engagements; and
they embarked in the gondola for St.
Mark's, where the &s;ame gay company
&s;eemed to flutter as on the preceding night.
The cool breeze, the gla&s;&s;y &s;ea, the gentle
&s;ound of its waves, and the &s;weeter mur|mur
of di&s;tant mu&s;ic; the lofty porticos and
arcades, and the happy groups that &s;aun|tered
beneath them; the&s;e, with every fea|ture
and circum&s;tance of the &s;cene, united
to charm Emily, no longer tea&s;ed by the
officious attentions of Count Morano. But,
as &s;he looked upon the moon-light &s;ea, un|dulating
along the walls of St. Mark, and,
lingering for a moment over tho&s;e walls,
caught the &s;weet and melancholy &s;ong of
&s;ome gondolier as he &s;at in his boat below,
waiting for his ma&s;ter, her &s;oftened mind
<PB N="70" REF="72">
returned to the memory of her home, of
her friends, and of all that was dear in her
native country.</P>
<P>After wa$king &s;ome time, they &s;at down at
the door of a Ca&s;ino, and, while Cavigni was
accommodating them with coffee and ice,
were joined by Count Morano. He &s;ought
Emily with a look of impatient delight,
who, remembering all the attention he had
&s;hewn her on the preceding evening, was
compelled, as before, to &s;hrink from his
a&s;&s;iduities into a timid re&s;erve, except when
&s;he conver&s;ved with Signora Herminia and
the other ladies of her party.</P>
<P>It was near midnight before they with|drew
to the opera, where Emily was not &s;o
charmed but that, when &s;he remembered
the &s;cene &s;he had ju&s;t quitted, &s;he felt how
infinitely inferior all the &s;plendour of art is
to the &s;ublimity of nature. Her heart was
not now affected, tears of admiration did
not &s;tart to her eyes, as when &s;he viewed
the va&s;t expan&s;e of ocean, the grandeur
of the heavens, and li&s;tened to the rolling.
<PB N="71" REF="73">
waters, and to the faint mu&s;ic that, at in|tervals,
mingled with their roar. Remem|bering
the&s;e, the &s;cene before her faded
into in&s;ignificance.</P>
<P>Of the evening, which pa&s;&s;on without
any particular incident, &s;he wi&s;hed the conclu&s;ion,
that &s;he might e&s;cape from the at|tentions
of the Count; and, as oppo&s;ite
qualities frequently attract each other in our
thoughts, thus Emily, when &s;he looked on
Count Morano, remembered Valancourt,
and a &s;igh &s;ometime followed the recol|lection.</P>
<P>Several weeks pa&s;&s;ed in the cour&s;e of
cu&s;tomary vi&s;its, during which nothing re|markable
occurred. Emily was amu&s;ed
by the manners and &s;cenes that &s;urrounded
her, &s;o different from tho&s;e of France, but
where Count Morano, too frequently for
her comfort, contrived to introduce him|&s;elf.
His manner, figure and accompli&s;h|ment,
which were generally admired,
Emily would, perhaps, have admired al&s;o,
had her heart been di&s;engaged from Va|lancourt,
<PB N="72" REF="74">
and had the Count forborne to
per&s;ecute her with officious attentions, dur|ing
which &s;he ob&s;erved &s;ome traits in his
character, that prejudiced her again&s;t what|ever
might otherwi&s;e be good in it.</P>
<P>Soon after his arrival at Venice, Mon|toni
received a packet from M. Que&s;nel,
in which the latter mentioned the death of
his wife's uncle, at his villa on the Brenta;
and that, in con&s;equence of this event, he
&s;hould ha&s;ten to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of that
e&s;tate and of other effects bequeathed to
him. This uncle was the brother of
Madame Que&s;nel's late mother; Montoni
was related to her by the father's &s;ide, and
though he could have had neither claim
nor expectation concerning the&s;e po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions,
he could &s;carcely conceal the envy which
M. Que&s;nel's letter excited.</P>
<P>Emily had ob&s;erved with concern, that,
&s;ince they left France, Montoni had not
even affected kindne&s;s towards her aunt,
and that, after treating her, at fir&s;t, with
neglect, he now met her with uniform ill|humour
<PB N="73" REF="75">
and re&s;erve. She had never &s;up|po&s;ed,
that her aunt's foibles could have
e&s;caped the di&s;cernment of Montoni, or
that her mind or figure were of a kind to
de&s;erve his attention. Her &s;urpri&s;e, there|fore,
at this match, had been extreme; but
&s;ince he had made the choice, &s;he did not
&s;u&s;pect that he would &s;o openly have di&s;co|vered
his contempt of it. But Montoni,
who had been allured by the &s;eeming wealth
of Madame Cheron, was now &s;everely di&s;|appointed
by her comparative poverty, and
highly exa&s;perated by the deceit &s;he had
employed to conceal it, till concealment
was no longer nece&s;&s;ary. He had been
deceived in an affair, wherein he meant to
be the deceiver; out-witted by the &s;uperior
cunning of a woman, who&s;e under&s;tanding
he de&s;pi&s;ed, and to whom he had &s;acrificed
his pride and his liberty, without &s;aviang
him&s;elf from the ruin, which had impended
over his head. Madame Montoni had
contrived to have the greate&s;t part of what
&s;he really did po&s;&s;e&s;s, &s;ettled upon her&s;elf:
<PB N="74" REF="76">
what remained, though it was totally inade|quate
both to her hu&s;band's expectation,
and to his nece&s;&s;ities, he had converted into
money, and brought with him to Venice,
that he might a little longer delude &s;ociety,
and make a la&s;t effort to regain the fortunes
he had lo&s;t</P>
<P>The hints which had been thrown out to
Valancourt, concerning Montoni's charac|ter
and condition, were too true; but it
was now left to time and occa&s;ion, to un|fold
the circum&s;tances, both of what had,
and of what had not been hinted, and to
time and occa&s;ion we commit them.</P>
<P>Madame Montoni was not of a nature to
bear injuries with meekne&s;s, or to re&s;ent
them with dignity: her exa&s;perated pride
di&s;played it&s;elf in all the violence and
acrimony of a little, or at lea&s;t of an ill|regulated
mind. She would not acknow|ledge,
even to her&s;elf, that &s;he had in any
degree provoked contempt by her dupli|city,
but weakly per&s;i&s;ted in believing, that
&s;he alone was to be pitied, and Montoni
<PB N="75" REF="77">
alone to be cen&s;ure; for, as her mind had
naturally little perception of moral obliga|tion,
&s;he &s;eldom under&s;tood its force but
when it happened to be violated towards
her&s;elf: her vanity had already been &s;evere|ly
&s;hocked by a di&s;covery of Montoni's
contempt; it remained to be farther re|proved
by a di&s;covery of his circum&s;tances.
His man&s;ion at Venice, though its furniture
di&s;covered a part of the truth to unprejudiced
per&s;ons, told nothing to tho&s;e who were
blinded by a re&s;olution to believe whatever
they wi&s;hed. Madame Montoni &s;till thought
her&s;elf little le&s;s than a prince&s;s, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing
a palace at Venice, and a ca&s;tle among the
Apennines. To the ca&s;tle di Udolpho,
indeed, Montoni &s;ometimes talked of going
for a few weeks to examine into its condi|tion,
and to receive &s;ome rents; for it appeared
that he had not been there for two
years, and that, during this period, it had
been inhabited only by an old &s;ervant,
whom he called his &s;teward.</P>
<P><PB N="76" REF="78">
Emily li&s;tened to the mention of this
journey with plea&s;ure, for &s;he not only
expected from it new ideas, but a relea&s;e
from the per&s;evering a&s;&s;iduities of Count
Morano. In the country, too, &s;he would
have lei&s;ure to think of Valancourt, and to
indulge the melancholy, which his image,
and a recollection of the &s;cenes of La Val|lee,
always ble&s;&s;ed with the memory of her
parent, awakened. The ideal &s;cenes were
dearer, and more &s;oothing to her heart,
than all the &s;plendour of gay a&s;&s;emblies;
they were a kind of tali&s;man that expelled
the poi&s;on of temporary evils, and &s;upported
her hopes of happy days: they appeared
like a beautiful land&s;cape, lighted up by a
gleam of &s;un-&s;hine, and &s;een through a per
&s;pective of dark and rugged rocks.</P>
<P>But count Morano did not long confine
him&s;elf to &s;ilent a&s;&s;iduities; he declared
his pa&s;&s;ion to Emily, and made propo&s;als
to Montoni, who encouraged, though
Emily rejected him: with Montoni for his
<PB N="77" REF="79">
friend, and an abundance of vanity to de|lude
him, he did not de&s;pair of &s;ucce&s;s
Emily was a&s;toni&s;hed and highly di&s;gu&s;ted
at his per&s;everance, after &s;he had explained
her &s;entiments with a frankne&s;s that would
not allow him to mi&s;under&s;tand them.</P>
<P>He now pa&s;&s;ed the greater part of his
time at Montoni's, dining there almo&s;t
daily, and attending Madame and Emily
wherever they went; and all this, notwith|&s;tanding
the uniform re&s;erve of Emily,
who&s;e aunt &s;eemed as anxious as Montoni
to promote this marriage; and would never
di&s;pen&s;e with her attendance at any a&s;&s;embly
where the Count propo&s;ed to be pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>Montoni now &s;aid nothing of his intended
journey, of which Emily waited impatiently
to hear; and he was &s;eldom at home but
when the Count, or Signor Or&s;ino, was there,
fro between him&s;elf and Cavigni a coolne&s;s
&s;eemed to &s;ub&s;i&s;t, though the latter re|mained
in his hou&s;e. With Or&s;ino, Mon|toni
was frequently clo&s;eted for hours to|gether,
and, whatever might be the bu&s;i|ne&s;s,
<PB N="78" REF="80">
upon which they con&s;ulted, it ap|peared
to be of con&s;equence, &s;ince Mon|toni
often &s;acrifice to it his favourite
pa&s;&s;ion for play, and remained at home the
whole night. There was &s;omewhat of
privacy, too, in the manner of Or&s;ino's
vi&s;its, which had never before occurred,
and which excited not only &s;urpri&s;e, but
&s;ome degree of alarm in Emily's mind,
who had unwillingly di&s;covered much of
his character when he had mo&s;t endea|voured
to di&s;gui&s;e it. After the&s;e vi&s;its,
Montoni was often more thoughtful than
u&s;ual; &s;ometimes the deep workings of
his mind entirely ab&s;tracted him from &s;ur|rounding
objects, and threw a gloom over
his vi&s;age that rendered it terrible; at
others, his eyes &s;eemed almo&s;t to fla&s;h
fire, and all the energies of his &s;oul appear|ed
to be rou&s;ed for &s;ome great enterpri&s;e.
Emily ob&s;erved the&s;e written characters of
his thoughts with deep intere&s;t, and not
without &s;ome degree of awe, when &s;he con|&s;idered
that &s;he was entirely in his power; but
<PB N="79" REF="81">
forbore even to hint her fears, or her ob&s;er|vations,
to Madame Montoni, who di&s;|cerned
nothing in her hu&s;band, at the&s;e
times, but his u&s;ual &s;ternne&s;s.</P>
<P>A &s;econd letter from M. Que&s;nel annou|ced
the arrival of him&s;elf and his lady
at the villa Miarenti; &s;tated &s;everal cir|cum&s;tances
of his good fortune, re&s;pecting
the affair that had brought him into Italy;
and concluded with an earne&s;t reque&s;t to
&s;ee Montoni, his wife and niece, at his new
e&s;tate.</P>
<P>Emily received, about the &s;ame period,
a much more intere&s;ting letter, and which
foothed for a while every anxiety of her
heart. Valancourt, hoping &s;he might be
&s;till at Venice, had tru&s;ted a letter to the
ordinary po&s;t, that told her of his health,
and of his uncea&s;ing and anxious affection.
He had lingered at Tholou&s;e for &s;ome time
after her departure, that he might indulge
the melancholy plea&s;ure of wandering
through the &s;cenes where he had been ac|cu&s;tomed
to behold her, and had thence
<PB N="80" REF="82">
gone to his brother's chateau, which was in
the neighbourhood of La Vallée. Having
mentioned this, he added, &startq;If the duty
of attending may regiment did not require
my departure, I know not when I &s;hould
have re&s;olution enough to quit the neigh|bourhood
of a place which is endeared by
the remembrance of you. The vicinity to
La Vallée has alone detained me thus long
at E&s;tuviere: I frequently ride thither early
in the morning, that I may wander, at
lei&s;ure, through the day, among &s;cenes,
which were once your home, where I have
been accu&s;tomed to &s;ee you, and to hear
you conver&s;e. I have renewed my ac|quintance
with the good old There&s;a,
who rejoiced to &s;ee me, that &s;he might talk
of you: I need not &s;ay how much this
circum&s;tance attached me to her, or how
eagerly I li&s;tened to her upon her favourite
&s;ubject. You will gue&s;s the motive that
fir&s;t induced me to make my&s;elf known to
There&s;a: it was, indeed, no other than
that of gaining admittance into the chateau
<PB N="81" REF="83">
and gardens, which my Emily had &s;o late|ly
inhabited: here, then, I wander, and
meet your image under every &s;hade: but
chiefly I love to fit beneath the &s;preading
branches of your favourite plane, where
once, Emily, we &s;at together; where I fir&s;t
ventured to tell you, that I loved. O
Emily! the remembrance of tho&s;e moments
overcomes me&mdash;I &s;it lo&s;t in reverie&mdash;I
endeavour to &s;ee you dimly through my tears,
in all the heaven of peace and innocence,
&s;uch as you then appeared to me; to hear
again the accents of that voice, which then
thrilled my heart with tenderne&s;s and hope.
I lean on the wall of the terrace, where we
together watched the rapid current of the
Garonne below, while I de&s;cribed the wild
&s;cenery about its &s;ource, but thought only of
you. O Emily! are the&s;e moments pa&s;&s;ed
for ever&mdash;will they never more return?&endq;</P>
<P>In another part of his letter he wrote
thus. &startq;You &s;ee my letter in dated on many
different days, and, if you look back to
the fir&s;t, you will perceive, that I began to
<PB N="82" REF="84">
write &s;oon after your departure from France.
To write was, indeed, the only employment
that withdrew me from my own melancholy
and rendered your ab&s;ence &s;upportable, or
rather, it &s;eemed to de&s;troy ab&s;ence; for,
when I was conver&s;ing with you on paper,
and telling you every &s;entiment and affection
of my heart, you almo&s;t appeared to
be pre&s;ent. This employment has been
from time to time my chief con&s;olation,
and I have deferred &s;ending off my packet,
merely for the comfort of prolonging it,
though it was certain, that what I had
written, was written to no purpo&s;e till you
received it. Whenever my mind has been
more than u&s;ually depre&s;&s;ed I have come
to pour forth its &s;orrows to you, and have
always &s;ound con&s;olation; and, when any
little occurrence has intere&s;ted my heart,
and given a gleam of joy to may &s;pirits, I
have ha&s;tened to communicate it to you,
and have received reflected &s;atisfaction.
Thus, my letter is a kind of picture of my
life and of my thoughts for the la&s;t month,
<PB N="83" REF="85">
and thus, though it had been deeply intere&s;t|ing
to me, while I wrote it, and I dare hope
will, for the &s;ame rea&s;on, be not indifferent
to you, yet to other readers it would &s;eem
to abound only in Frivolities Thus it is
always, when we attempt to de&s;cribe the finer
movements of the heart, for they are too fine
to be di&s;cerned, they can only be experi
enced, and are therefore pa&s;&s;ed over by the
indifferent ob&s;erver, while the intere&s;ted one
feels, that all de&s;cription is imperfect and
unnece&s;&s;ary, except as it may prove the
&s;incerity of the writer, and &s;oothe his own
&s;ufferings. You will pardon all this
egoti&s;m&mdash;for I am a lover.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I have ju&s;t heard of a circum&s;tance,
which entirely de&s;troys all my fairy para
di&s;e of ideal delight, and which will recon
cile me to the nece&s;&s;ity of returning to my
regiment, for I mu&s;t no longer wander be|neath
the beloved &s;hades, where I have been
accu&s;tomed to meet you in thought&mdash;La
Vallée is let! I have rea&s;on to believe this
is without your knowledge, from what
<PB N="84" REF="86">
There&s;a told me this morning, and, there
fore, I mention the circum&s;tance. She &s;hed
tears, while &s;he related, that &s;he was going
to leave the &s;ervice of her dear mi&s;tre&s;s, and
the chateau where &s;he had lived &s;o many
happy years; and all this, added &s;he, with
out even a letter from Mademoi&s;elle to &s;often
the news; but it is all Mon&s;. Que&s;nel's do|ings,
and I dare &s;ay &s;he does not even know
what is going forward.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;There&s;a added, That &s;he had received a letter from him, informing her the chateau
was let, and that, as her &s;ervices would no
longer be required, &s;he mu&s;t quit the place,
on that day week, when the new tenant
would arrive.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;There&s;a had been &s;urpri&s;ed by a &amp; vi&s;it
from M. Que&s;nel, &s;ome time before the receipt
of this letter, who was accompanied
by a &s;tranger that viewed the premi&s;es with
much curio&s;ity.&endq;</P>
<P>Towards the conclu&s;ion of his letter,
which is dated a week after this &s;entence,
Valancourt adds, &startq;I have received a fum|mons
<PB N="85" REF="87">
from my regiment, and I join it
without regret, &s;ince I am &s;hut out from
the &s;cenes that are &s;o intere&s;ting to my heart.
I rode to La Vallée this morning, and heard
that the new tenant was arrived, and that
There&s;a was gone. I &s;hould not treat the
&s;ubject thus familiarly if I did not believe
you to be uninformed of this di&s;po&s;al of
your hou&s;e; for your &s;atisfaction I have
endeavoured to learn &s;omething of the cha|racter
and fortune of your tenant, but with|out
&s;ucce&s;s. He is a gentleman, they &s;ay,
and this is all I can hear. The place, as I
wandered round the boundaries, appeared
more melancholy to my imagination, than
I had ever &s;een it. I whi&s;hed earne&s;tly to
have got admittance, that I might have
taken another leave of your favourite plane|tree,
and thougth of you once more beneath
its &s;hade: but I forbore to tempt the cu|rio&s;ity
of &s;trangers: the fi&s;hing-hou&s;e in the
woods, however, was &s;till open to me; thither
I went, and pa&s;&s;ed an hour, which I
cannot even look back upon without emo|tion.
<PB N="86" REF="88">
O Emily! &s;urely we are not &s;epa|rated-for
ever&mdash;&s;urely we &s;hall live for each
other!"</P>
<P>This letter brought many tears to Emily's
eyes; tears of tenderne&s;s and &s;atisfaction
on learning that Valancourt was well, and
that time and ab&s;ence had in no degree
effaced her image from his heart. There
were pa&s;&s;ages in this letter which particu|larly
affected her, &s;uch as tho&s;e de&s;cribing
his vi&s;its to La Vallée, and the &s;en|timents
of delicate affection that its &s;cenes had
awakened. It was a con&s;iderable time before
her mind was &s;ufficiently ab&s;tracted from
Valancourt to feel the force of his intelligence
concerning La Vallée. That Mon&s;. Que&s;nel
&s;hould let it, without even con&s;ulting her
on the mea&s;ure, both &s;urpir&s;ed and &s;hocked
her, particularly as it proved the ab&s;olute
authority he thought him&s;elf entitled to
exerci&s;e in her affairrs. It is true, he had
propo&s;ed, before &s;he left France, that the
chateau &s;hould be let, during her ab&s;ence,
and to the oeonomical prudence of this
<PB N="87" REF="89">
&s;he had nothing to object; but the com|mitting
what had been her father's villa to
the power and caprice of &s;trangers, and the
depriving her&s;elf of a &s;ure home, &s;hould
any unhappy circum&s;tances make her look
back to her home as an a&s;ylum, were con|&s;iderations
that made her, even then,
&s;trongly oppo&s;e the mea&s;ure. Her father,
too, in his la&s;t hour, had received from her
a &s;olemn promi&s;e never to di&s;po&s;e of La
Vallée; and this &s;he con&s;idered as in
&s;ome degree violated if &s;he &s;uffered the
place to be let. But it was now evident
with how little re&s;pect M. Que&s;nel had
regarded the&s;e objections, and how in&s;ig|nificant
he con&s;idered every ob&s;tacle to pe|cuniary
advantage. It appeared, al&s;o, that
he had not even conde&s;cended to in|form
Montoni of the &s;tep he had taken,.
&s;ince no motive was evident for Montoni's
concealing the circum&s;tance from her, if it
had been made known to him: this both di&s;|plea&s;ed
and &s;urpri&s;ed her; but the chief &s;ubjects
of her unea&s;ine&s;s were&mdash;the temporary
<PB N="88" REF="90">
di&s;po&s;al of La Vallée, and the di&s;mi&s;&s;ion
of her father's old and faithful &s;ervant.
&startq;Poor There&s;a,&endq; &s;aid Emily, &startq;thou had&s;t
not &s;aved much in thy &s;ervitude, for thou
wa&s;t always tender towards the poor, and
believed'&s;t thou &s;hould&s;t die in the family,
where thy be&s;t years had been &s;pent.
Poor There&s;a!&mdash;now thou art turned out
in thy old age to &s;eek thy bread!&endq;</P>
<P>Emily wept bitterly as the&s;e thoughts
pa&s;&s;ed over her mind, and &s;he determined
to con&s;ider what could be done for There&s;a,
and to talk very explicitly to M. Que&s;nel
on the &s;ubject; but &s;he much feared that
his cold heart could feel only for it&s;elf. she
determined al&s;o to enquire whether he had
made any mention of her affairs, in his let|ters
to Montoni, who &s;oon gave her the
opportunity &s;he &s;ought, by de&s;iring that &s;he
would attend him in his &s;tudy. She had
little doubt, that the interview was intended
for the purpo&s;e of communicating to her a
part of M. Que&s;nel's letter concerning the
<PB N="89" REF="91">
tran&s;actions at La Vallée, and &s;he obeyed
him immediately. Montoni was alone.</P>
<P>&startq;I have ju&s;t been writing to Mon&s;.
Que&s;nel,&endq; &s;aid he when Emily appeared,
&startq;in reply to the letter I received from
him a few days ago, and I wi&s;hed to talk
to you upon a &s;ubject that occupied part
of it.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I al&s;o wi&s;hed to &s;peak with you on
this topic, &s;ir,&endq; &s;aid Emily.</P>
<P>&startq;It is a &s;ubject of &s;ome intere&s;t to you,
undoubtedly,&endq; rejoined Montoni, &startq;and I
think you mu&s;t &s;ee it in the light that I
do; indeed it will not bear any other. I
tru&s;t you will agree with me, that any ob|jection
founded on &s;entiment, as they call
it, ought to yield to circum&s;tances of &s;olid
advantage.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Granting this, &s;ir.&endq; replied Emily,
mode&s;tly, &startq;tho&s;e of humanity ought &s;urely
to be attended to. But I fear it is now too
late to deliberate upon this plan, and I Mu&s;t
regret, that it is no longer in my power to
reject it.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="90" REF="92">
&startq;It is too late,&endq; &s;aid Montoni, &startq;but
&s;ince it is &s;o, I am plea&s;ed to ob&s;erve, that
you &s;ubmit to rea&s;on and nece&s;&s;ity with|out
indulging u&s;ele&s;s complaint. I applaud
this conduct exceedingly, the more, per|haps,
&s;ince it di&s;covers a &s;trength of mind
&s;eldom ob&s;ervable in your &s;ex. When
you are older you will look back with gra|titude
to the friends who a&s;&s;i&s;ted in re&s;cuing
you from the romantic illu&s;ions of &s;entiment,
and will perceive, that they are only
the &s;nares of childhood, and &s;hould be
vanqui&s;hed the moment you e&s;cape from
the nur&s;ery. I have not clo&s;ed my letter,
and you may add a few lines to inform your
uncle of your acquie&s;cence. You will
&s;oon &s;ee him, for it is my intention to take
you, with Madame Montoni, in a few days
to Miarenti, and you can then talk over
the affair.&endq;</P>
<P>Emily wrote on the oppo&s;ite page of the
paper as follows:</P>
<P>&startq;It is now u&s;ele&s;s, &s;ir, for me to remon|&s;trate
upon the circum&s;tances of which
<PB N="91" REF="93">
Signor Montoni informs me that he has
written. I could have wi&s;hed, at lea&s;t, that
the affair had been concluded with le&s;s pr|cipitation,
that I might have taught my&s;elf
to &s;ubdue &s;ome prejudices, as the Signor
calls them, which &s;till linger in my heart.
As it is, I &s;ubmit. In point of prudence
nothing certainly can be objected; but,
though I &s;ubmit, I have yet much to &s;ay
on &s;ome other points of the &s;ubject, when
I &s;hall have the honour of &s;eeing you. In
the meantime I entreat you will take care
of There&s;a, for the &s;ake of,</P>

Your affectionate niece,

</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<P>Montoni &s;miled &s;atirically at what Emily
had written, but did not object to it, and
&s;he withdrew to her own apartment, where
&s;he &s;at down to begin a letter to Valancourt,
in which &s;he related the particulars of her
journey, and her arrival at Venice, de&s;cribed
&s;ome of the mo&s;t &s;triking &s;cenes in the pa&s;|&s;age
<PB N="92" REF="94">
over the Alps; her emotions on her
fir&s;t view of Italy; the manners and cha|racters
of the people around her, and &s;ome
few circum&s;tances of Montoni's conduct.
But &s;he avoided even naming Count Mo|rano,
much more the declaration he had
made, &s;ince &s;he well knew how tremblingly
alive to fear is real love, how jealou&s;ly
watchful of every circum&s;tance that may
affect its intere&s;t; and &s;he &s;crupulou&s;ly
avoided to give Valancourt even the &s;lighte&s;t
rea&s;on for believing he had a rival.</P>
<P>On the following day Count Morano
dined again at Montoni's. He was in an
uncommon flow of &s;pirits, and Emily
thought there was &s;omewhat of exultation
in his manner of addre&s;&s;ing her, which &s;he
had never ob&s;erved before. She endeavour|ed
to repre&s;s this by more than her u&s;ual re|&s;erve,
but the cold civility of her air now
&s;eemed rather to encourage than to depr&s;s
him. He appeared watchful of an oppor|tunity
of &s;peaking with her alone, and more
than once &s;olicited this; but Emily always
<PB N="93" REF="95">
replied, that &s;he could hear nothing from
him which he would be unwilling to repeat
before the whole company.</P>
<P>In the evening, Madame Montoni and
her party went out upon the &s;ea, and as
the Count led Emily to his <HI>zendaletto,</HI> he
carried her hand to his lips, and thanked
her for the conde&s;cension &s;he had &s;hewn
him,. Emily, in extreme &s;urpri&s;e and di&s;|pleas&s;ure,
ha&s;tily withdrew her hand, and
concluded that he had &s;poken ironically;
but, on reaching the &s;teps of the terrace,
and ob&s;erving by the livery, that it was
the Count's <HI>zendaletto,</HI> which waited below,
while the re&s;t of the party, having arranged
themselves in the gondolas, were moving
on, &s;he determined not to permit a &s;eparate
conver&s;ation, and, wi&s;hing him a good
evening, returned to the portico, The
Count followed to expo&s;tulate and entreat,
and Montoni, who then came out, re
dered &s;olicitation unnece&s;&s;ary, for, without
conde&s;cending to &s;peak, he took her hand,
and led her to the <HI>zendaletto.</HI> Emily was
<PB N="94" REF="96">
not &s;ilent; &s;he entreated Montoni, in a low
voice, to con&s;ider the impropriety of the&s;e
circum&s;tances, and that he would &s;pare her
the mortification of &s;ubmitting to them;
he, however, was inflexible.</P>
<P>&startq;This caprice is intolerable,&endq; &s;aid he,
&startq;and &s;hall not be indulged: here is no
impropriety in the ca&s;e.&endq;</P>
<P>At this moment, Emily's di&s;like of Count
Morano aro&s;e to abhorrence. That he
&s;hould, with undaunted a&s;&s;urance, thus
pur&s;ue her, notwith&s;tanding all &s;he had
expre&s;&s;ed on the &s;ubject of his addre&s;&s;es,
and think, as it was evident he did, that
her opinion of him was of no con&s;equence,
&s;o long as his preten&s;ions were &s;anctioned by
Montoni, added indignation to the di&s;gu&s;t
which &s;he had felt towards his. She was
&s;omewhat relieved by ob&s;erving that Mon|toni
was to be of the party, who &s;eated him|&s;elf
on one &s;ide of her, while Morano placed
him&s;elf on the other. There was a pau&s;e
of &s;ome moments as the gondolieri prepared
their oars, and Emily trembled from appre|hen&s;ion
<PB N="95" REF="97">
of the di&s;cour&s;e that might follow
this &s;ilence. At length &s;he collected cou|rage
to break it her&s;elf, in the hope of pre|venting
fine &s;peeches from Morano, and
reproof from Montoni. To &s;ome trivial
remark which &s;he made, the letter returned
a &s;hort and di&s;obliging reply; but Morano
immediately followed with a general ob|&s;ervation,
which he contrived to end with a
particular compliment, and, though Emily
pa&s;&s;ed it without even the notice of a &s;mile,
he was not di&s;couraged.</P>
<P>&startq;I have been impatient,&endq; &s;aid he, ad|dre&s;&s;ing
Emily, &startq;to expre&s;s my gratitude;
to thank you for your goodne&s;s; but I mu&s;t
al&s;o thank Signor Montoni, who has allow|ed
me this opportunity of doing &s;o.&endq;</P>
<P>Emily regarded the Count with a look
of mingled a&s;toni&s;hment and di&s;plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>&startq;Why.&endq; continued he, &startq;&s;hould you
wi&s;h to dimini&s;h the delight of this mo|ment
by that air of cruel re&s;erve?&mdash;Why
&s;eek to throw me again into the perplexities
of doubt, by teaching your eyes to contra|dict
<PB N="96" REF="98">
the kindne&s;s of your late declaration?
You cannot doubt the &s;incerity, the ardour
of my pa&s;&s;ion; it is therefore unnece&s;&s;ary,
charming Emily! &s;urely unnece&s;&s;ary, any
longer to attempt a di&s;gui&s;e of your &s;enti|ments.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;If ever had di&s;gui&s;ed them, &s;ir,&endq; &s;aid
Emily, with recollected &s;pirit, &startq;it would
certainly be unnece&s;&s;ary any longer to do
&s;o. I had hoped, &s;ir, that you would
have &s;pared me any farther nece&s;&s;ity of al|luding
to them; but, &s;ince you do not
grant this, hear me declare, and for the la&s;t
time, that your per&s;everance had deprived
you even of the e&s;teem, which I was in|clined
to believe you merited.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;A&s;toni&s;hing!&endq; exclaimed Montoni
&startq;this is beyond even my expectation, though
I have hitherto done ju&s;tice to the caprice
of the &s;ex! But you will ob&s;erve, Made|moi&s;elle
Emily, that I am no lover, though
Count Morano is, and that I will not be
made the amu&s;ement of your capricious
moments. Here is the offer of an alliance,
<PB N="97" REF="99">
which would do honour to any family;
yours, you will recollect, is not noble; you
long re&s;i&s;ted my remon&s;trances, but my
honour is now engaged, and it &s;hall not
be trifled with.&mdash;You &s;hall adhere to the
declaration, which you have made me an
agent to convey to the Count.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I mu&s;t certainly mi&s;take you, &s;ir,&endq; &s;aid
Emily; &startq;my an&s;wers on the &s;ubject have
been uniform; it is unworthy of you to
accu&s;e me of caprice. If you have con|de&s;cended
to be my agent, it is an honour
I did not folicit. I my&s;elf have con&s;tantly
a&s;&s;ured Count Morano, and you al&s;o, &s;ir,
that I never can accept the honour he offers
me, and I now repeat the declaration.&endq;</P>
<P>The Count looked with an air of &s;urpir&s;e
and enquiry at Montoni, who&s;e countenance
al&s;o was marked with &s;urpi&s;e, but it was
&s;urpi&s;e mingled with indignation.</P>
<P>&startq;Here is confidence, as well as caprice!&endq;
&s;aid the latter, &startq;Will you deny your own
words, Madam?</P>
<P>&startq;Such a que&s;tion is unworthy of an an|&s;wer,

&s;ir;&s;aid Emily blu&s;hing; you wil$
recollect your&s;elf, and be &s;orry that you
have a&s;ked it.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Speak to the point,&endq; rejoined Mon|toni,
in a voice of increa&s;ing vehemence.
&startq;Will you deny your own words; will
you deny, that you acknowledged, only
a few hours ago, that it was too late to
recede from your engagements, and that
you accepted the Count's hand?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I will deny all this, for no words of
mine ever imported it.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;A&s;toni&s;hing! Will you deny what you
wrote to Mon&s;. Que&s;nel, your uncle? If
you do, you own hand will bear te&s;timony
again&s;t you. What have you now to &s;ay?&endq;
continued Montoni, ob&s;erving the &s;ilence
and confu&s;ion of Emily.</P>
<P>&startq;I now perceive, &s;ir, that you are under
a very great error, and that I have been
equally mi&s;taken.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;No more duplicity, I entreat; be
open and candid, if it be po&s;&s;ible.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I have always been &s;o, &s;ir; and can
<PB N="99" REF="101">
claim no merit in &s;uch conduct, for I have
had nothing to conceal.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;How is this, Signor?&endq; cried Morano,
with trembliing emotion.</P>
<P>&startq;Su&s;pend your judgment, Count,&endq; re|plied
Montoni, &startq;the wiles of a female
heart are un&s;earchable. Now, Madam,
your <HI>explanation.</HI>&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Excu&s;e me, &s;ir, if I withhold my ex|planation
till you appear willing to give me
your confidence; a&s;&s;ertion at pre&s;ent can
only &s;ubject me to in&s;ult.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Your explanation, I entreat you!&endq;
&s;aid Morano.</P>
<P>&startq;Well, well,&endq; rejoined Montoni, &startq;I
give you my condidence; let us hear this
explanation.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Let me lead to it then, by a&s;king a
que&s;tion.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;As many as you plea&s;e,&endq; &s;aid Mon|toni,
contemptuou&s;ly.</P>
<P>&startq;What, then, was the &s;ubject of your
letter to Mon&s;. Que&s;nell?&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="100" REF="102">
&startq;The &s;ame that was the &s;ubject of your
note to him, certainly. You did well to
&s;tipulate for my confidence before you de|manded
that que&s;tion.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I mu&s;t beg you will be more explicit,
&s;ir; what was that &s;ubject?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;What could it be, but the noble offer
of Count Morano,&endq; &s;aid Montoni</P>
<P>&startq;Then &s;ir we entirely mi&s;under&s;tood
each other,&endq; replied Emily.</P>
<P>&startq;We entirely mi&s;under&s;tood each other
too, I &s;uppo&s;e,&endq; rejoined Montoni, &startq;in
the conver&s;ation which preceded the writ|ing
of that note? I mu&s;t do you the ju&s;tice
to own, that you are very ingenious at this
&s;ame art of mi&s;under&s;tanding.&endq;</P>
<P>Emily tried to re&s;train the tears that
came to her eyes, and to an&s;wer with be|coming
firmne&s;s. &startq;Allow me, &s;ir, to ex|plain
my&s;elf fully or to be wholly &s;ilent.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;The explanation may now be di&s;|pen&s;ed
with; it is anticipated. If Count
Morano &s;till thinks one nece&s;&s;ary, I will
<PB N="101" REF="103">
give him an hone&s;t one.&mdash;You have changed
your intention &s;ince our la&s;t conver&s;ation;
and, if he can have patience and humility
enough to wait till to-morrow, he will pro|bably
find it changed again: but as I have
neither the patience or the humility, which
you expect from a lover, I warn you of the
effect of my di&s;plea&s;ure!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Montoni, you are too precipitate,&endq; &s;aid
the Count, who had li&s;tened to this con|ver&s;ation
in extreme anxiety and impa|tience;
- Signora, I entreat you own ex|planation
of this affair!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Signor Montoni has &s;aid ju&s;tly,&endq; re|plied
Emily, &startq;that explanation may
now be di&s;pen&s;ed with; after what has
pa&s;&s;ed I cannot &s;uffer my&s;elf to give one.
It is &s;ufficient for me, and for you, &s;ir, that
I repeat my late declaration; let me hope
this is the la&s;t time it will be nece&s;&s;ary for
me to repeat it - I never can accept the ho|nour
of you alliance.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Charming Emily!&endq; exclaimed the
count in an impa&s;&s;ioned tone, &startq;let not
<PB N="102" REF="104">
re&s;entment make you unju&s;t; let me not
&s;uffer for the offence of Montoni!- Re|voke&mdash;&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Offence!&endq; interrupted Montoni&mdash;
&startq;Count, this language is ridiculous, this
&s;ubmi&s;&s;ion is childi&s;h!- &s;peak as becomes
a man, not as the &s;lave of a pretty tyrant.&endq;
&startq;You di&s;tract me, Signor; &s;uffer me to
plead my own cau&s;e; you have already
proved in&s;ufficient to it.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;All conver&s;ation on this &s;ubject, &s;ir,&endq;
&s;aid Emily, &startq;is wor&s;e than u&s;ele&s;s, &s;ince
it can bring only pain to each of us: if you
would oblige me, pur&s;ue it no farther.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;It is impo&s;&s;ible, Madam, that I can
thus ea&s;ily re&s;ign the object of my life.
Which the delight and torment of my life.
-I mu&s;t &s;till love- &s;till pur&s;ue you with
unremitting ardour;- when you &s;hall be
convinced of the &s;trength and con&s;tancy of
my pa&s;&s;ion, your heart mu&s;t &s;often into pity
and repentance.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Is this generous, &s;ir? is this manly?
Can it it either de&s;erve or obtain the e&s;teem
<PB N="103" REF="105">
you folicit, thus to continue a per&s;ecution
from which I have no pre&s;ent means of
e&s;caping?&endq;</P>
<P>A gleam of moonlight that fell upon
Morano's countenance, revealed the &s;trong
emotions of his &s;oul; and, glancing on
Montoni di&s;covered the dark re&s;entment,
which contra&s;ted his features.</P>
<P>&startq;By heaven this is too much!&endq; &s;ud|denly
exclaimed the Count; &startq;Sugnor
Montoni, you treat me ill; it is from you
that I &s;hall look for explanation.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;From me, &s;ir! you &s;hall have it;&endq;
muttered Montoni, &startq;if your di&s;cernment
is indeed &s;o far ob&s;cured by pa&s;&s;ion, as to
make explanation nece&s;&s;ary. And for you,
Madam, you &s;hould learn, that a man of
honour is not to be trifled with, though you
may perhaps, with impunity, treat a boy
like a puppet.</P>
<P>This &s;arca&s;m rou&s;ed the pride of Mo|rano,
and the re&s;entment which he had felt
at the indifference of Emily, being lo&s;t in
indignation of the un&s;olence of Montoni;
<PB N="104" REF="106">
he determined to mortify him, by defend|ing
her.</P>
<P>&startq;This al&s;o he, replying to Mon|toni's
la&s;t words,&endq; this al&s;o, &s;hall not pa&s;s
unnoticed. I bid you learn, &s;ir, that you
have a &s;tronger enemy than a woman to
contend with: I will protect Signora St.
Aubert from your threatened re&s;entment.
You have misled me, and would revenge
your di&s;appointed views upon the inno|cent.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Mi&s;led you!&endq; retorted Montoni with
quickne&s;s, &startq;is my conduct-my word&endq;|then
pau&s;ing, while he &s;eemed endeavouring
to re&s;train the re&s;ignment, that fla&s;hed in his eyes, in
next moment, he added, in a
&s;ubdued voice, &startq;Count Morano, this is a
a language, a &s;ort of conduct to which I
am not accu&s;tomed: it is the conduct of a
passionate boy-as &s;uch, I pa&s;s it over in
contempt.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;In contempt, Signor?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;The re&s;pect I owe my&s;elf,&endq; rejoined
Montoni, requires, that I &s;hould conver&s;e
<PB N="105" REF="107">
more largely with you upon &s;ome points of
the &s;ubject in di&s;pute. Return with me to
Venice, and I will conde&s;cend to convince
you of your error,&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Conde&s;cend, &s;ir but I will not con|de&s;cend
to be &s;o conver&s;ed with.&endq;</P>
<P>Montoni &s;miled contemptuou&s;ly; and
Emily, now terrified for the con&s;equences
of what &s;he &s;aw and heard, could no longer
be &s;ilent. She explained the whole &s;ubject
upon which &s;he had mi&s;taken Montoni in
the morning, declaring, that &s;he under|&s;tood
to have con&s;ulted her &s;olely con|erning
the di&s;po&s;al of La Vallée, and
concluding with entreating, that he would
write immediately to M. Que&s;nel, and rec|tify
the mi&s;take.</P>
<P>But Montoni either was, or affected to
be, &s;till incredulous; and Count Morano
was &s;till entangled in perplexity. While
&s;he was &s;peaking, however, the attention of
her auditors had been diverted from the
immediate occa&s;ion of their re&s;entment,
and their pa&s;&s;ion con&s;equently became le&s;s.
<PB N="106" REF="108">
Montoni de&s;ired the Count would order
his &s;ervants to row back to Venice, that he
might have &s;ome private conve&s;ation with
him; and Morano, &s;omewhat &s;oothed by
his &s;oftened voice and manner, and eager
to examine into the full extent of his diffi|culties,
complied.</P>
<P>Emily, comforted by this pro&s;pect of re|lea&s;e,
employed the pre&s;ent moment in
endeavouring, with conciliating care, to
prevent any fatal mi&s;chief between the per|&s;ons
who &s;o lately had per&s;ecuted and in|&s;ulted
her.</P>
<P>Her &s;pirits revived, when &s;he heard once
more the voice of &s;ong and laughter, re|&s;ounding
from the grand canal, and at
length entered again between its &s;tately
piazzas. The <HI>zendaletto</HI> &s;topped at Mon|toni's
man&s;ion and the Count ha&s;tily led
her into the hall, where Montoni took his
arm, and &s;aid &s;omething in a low voice, on
which Morano ki&s;&s;ed the hand he held,
not with &s;tanding Emily's effort to di&s;en|gage
it, and, wi&s;hing her a good evening,
<PB N="107" REF="109">
with an accent look &s;he could not mi&s;|under&s;tand,
returned to his <HI>zendaletto</HI> with
Montoni.</P>
<P>Emily, in her own apartmient, con&s;idered
with inten&s;e anxiety all the unju&s;t and ty|rannical
conduct of Montoni, the dauntle&s;s
per&s;everance of Morano, and her own de|de&s;olate
&s;ituation, removed in vain to Va|lancourt,
confined by his profe&s;&s;ion to a
di&s;tant kingdom, as her protector; but it
gave her comfort to know, that there was,
at lea&s;t, one per&s;on in the world, who would &s;ymphathize in her
afflictions, and
who&s;e wi&s;hes would fly eagerly to relea&s;e
her. Yet &s;he determined not to give him
unavailing pain by relating the rea&s;ons &s;he
had to regret the having rejected his better
judgment concerning Montoni; rea&s;ons,
however, which could not induce her to
lament the delicacy and di&s;intere&s;ted affec|tion
that had made her reject his propo&s;al
for a clande&s;tine marriage. The approach|ing
interview with her uncle &s;he regarded
<PB N="108" REF="110">
with &s;ome degree of hope, for &s;he deter|mined
to repre&s;ent to him the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of
her &s;ituation, and to entreat that he would
allow her to return to France with him and
Madame Que&s;nel. Then, &s;uddenly re|membering
that her beloved La Vallée,
her only home, was no longer at her com|mand,
her tears flowed anew, and &s;he feared
that &s;he had little pity to expect from a man
who, like M. Quel&s;nel, could di&s;po&s;e of it
without deigning to con&s;ult with her, and
could di&s;mi&s;s an aged and faithful &s;ervant,
de&s;titute of either &s;upport or a&s;ylum. But,
though it was certain, that &s;he had her&s;elf
no longer a home in France and few, very few
friends there, &s;he determined to return,
if po&s;&s;ible, that &s;he might be relea&s;ed from
the power of Montoni, who&s;e particularly
oppre&s;&s;ive conduct towards her&s;elf, and ge|neral
character as to others, were ju&s;tly ter|ribleto
her imagination. She had no wi&s;h
to re&s;ide with her uncle, M, Que&s;nel, &s;ince
his behaviour to her late father and to her|&s;elf,
had been uniformly &s;uch as to con|vince
<PB N="109" REF="111">
her, that in flying to him &s;he could only
obtain an exchange of oppre&s;&s;ors; neither
had &s;he the &s;lighte&s;t intention of con&s;enting
to the propo&s;al of Valancourt for an imme|diate
marriage, though this would give her
a lawful and a generous prospector, for the chief
rea&s;ons, which had formerly influ|enced
her conduct, &s;till exi&s;ted against it while other,
which &s;eemed to ju&s;tify the
&s;tep, would now be done away; and his
intere&s;t his fame were at all times too dear
to her, to &s;uffer her to co&s;ent to a union,
which, at this early period of their lives,
would probably defeat both. One &s;ure,
and proper a&s;ylum, however, would &s;till
be open to her in France. She knew that
&s;he could board in the convent, where &s;he
had formerly experienced &s;o much kindne&s;s,
and which had an affecting and &s;olemn
claim upon her heart, &s;ince it contained the
remains of ther late father. Here &s;he could
remain in &s;afety and tranquillilty, till the
term, for which La Vallée might be let,
<PB N="110" REF="112">
&s;hould expire; or, till the arrangement of
M. Motteville's affairs enabled her &s;o far to
judge whether it would be prudent for her
to re&s;ide there.</P>
<P>Concerning Montoni's conduct with re|&s;pect
to his letters to M. Que&s;nel, &s;he had
many doubts; however he might be at fir&s;t
mi&s;taken on the &s;ubjuct, &s;he much &s;u&s;pected
that he wilfully per&s;evered in his error, as
a means of intimidating her into a com|pliance
with his wi&s;hes of uniting her to
Count Morano. Whether this was or was
not the fact, &s;he was extremely anxious
to explain the affair to M. Que&s;nel, and
looked forward with a mixture of impa|tience,
hope and fear, to her approaching
vi&s;it.</P>
<P>On the following day, Madame Mon|toni,
being alone with Emily, introduced
the mention of Count Morano, by ex|pre&s;&s;ing
her &s;urpri&s;e, that &s;he had not
joined the party on the water the preceding
<PB N="111" REF="113">
evening, and at her abrupt departure to
Venice. Emily then related what had
pa&s;&s;ed, expre&s;&s;ed her concern for the mu|tual
mi&s;take that had occurred between
Montoni and her&s;elf, and &s;olicited her aunt's
kind offices in urging him to give a deci&s;ive
denial to the Count's further addre&s;&s;es; but
&s;he &s;oon perceived, that Madame Montoni
had not been ignorant of the late conver&s;a|tion,
when &s;he introduced the pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>&startq;You have no encouragement to expect
from me,&endq; &s;aid her aunt, &startq;in the&s;e no|tions.
I have already given my opinion on
the &s;ubject, and think Signor Montoni right
in enforcing, by any means, your con&s;ent.
If young per&s;ons will be blind to their in|tere&s;t,
and ob&s;tinately oppo&s;e it, why, the
greate&s;t ble&s;&s;ings they can have are friends,
who will oppo&s;e their folly. Pray what
preten&s;ions of any kind do you think you
have to &s;uch a match as is now offered
you?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Not any whatever, Madam,&endq; replied
<PB N="112" REF="114">
Emily, &startq;and, therefore, at lea&s;t, &s;uffer
me to be happy in my humility.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Nay, niece, it cannot be denied, that
you have pride enough; my poor brother,
your father, had his &s;hare of pride too;
tough, let me add, his fortune did not
ju&s;tify it.&endq;</P>
<P>Emily, &s;omewhat embarra&s;&s;ed by the in|dignation,
which this malevolent allu&s;ion to
her father excited, and by the difficulty of
rendering her an&s;wer as temperate as it
&s;hould be reprehen&s;ive, he&s;itated for &s;ome
moments, in a confu&s;ion, which highly gra|tified
her aunt. At length &s;he &s;aid, &startq;My
father's pride, Madam, had a noble ob|ject
-the happine&s;s which he knew could
be derived only from goodne&s;s, knowledge
and charity. As it never con&s;i&s;ted in his
&s;uperiority, in point of fortune, to &s;ome
per&s;ons, it was not humbled by his inferi|ority,
in that respect, to others. He never
di&s;dained tho&s;e, who were wretched by po|verty
and misfortune; he did &s;ometimes
<PB N="113" REF="115">
de&s;pi&s;e per&s;ons, who with many opportu|nities
of happine&s;s, rendered them&s;elves
mi&s;erable by vanity, ignorance and cruelty.
I &s;hall think it my highe&s;t glory to emu|late
&s;uch pride.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I do not pretend to under&s;tand any
thing of the&s;e high flown &s;entiments, niece;
you have all that glory to your&s;elf: I would
teach you a little plain &s;en&s;e, and not have
you &s;o wi&s;e as to de&s;pi&s;e happine&s;s.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;That would indeed not be wi&s;dom,
but folly,&endq; &s;aid Emily, &startq;for wi&s;dom can
boa&s;t no higher attainment than happine&s;s;
but you will allow, Madam, that our ideas
of happine&s;s may differ. I cannot doubt,
that you wi&s;h me to be happy, but I mu&s;t
fear you are mi&s;taken in the means of mak|ing
me &s;o.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I cannot boa&s;t of a learned education,
niece, &s;uch as your father thought proper
to give you, and, therefore, do not pre|tend
to under&s;tand all the&s;e fine &s;peeches
about happine&s;s. I mu&s;t be contented to
under&s;tand only common &s;en&s;e, and happy
<PB N="114" REF="116">
would it have been for you and your father,
if that had been included in his education.&endq;</P>
<P>Emily was too much &s;hocked by the&s;e
reflections on her father's memory, to de|&s;pi&s;e
this &s;peech as it de&s;erved.</P>
<P>Madame Montoni was about to &s;peak,
but Emily quitted the room, and retired to
her own, where the little &s;pirit &s;he had
lately exerted yielded to grief and vex|ation,
and left her only to her tears. From
every review of her &s;ituation &s;he could de|rive,
indeed, only new &s;orrow. To the
di&s;covery, which had ju&s;t been forced upon
her, of Montoni's unworthine&s;s &s;he had
now to add, that of the cruel vanity, for
the gratification of which her aunt was
about to &s;acrifice her; of the effrontery
and cunning, with which, at the time that
&s;he meditated the &s;acrifice, &s;he boa&s;ted of
her tenderne&s;s, or in&s;ulted her victim: and
of the venomous envy, which, as it did not
&s;cruple to attack her father's character,
could &s;carcely be expected to withhold
form her own.</P>
<P><PB N="115" REF="117">
During the few days, that intervened be|tween
this conver&s;ation and the departure
for Miarenti, Montoni did not once addre&s;s
him&s;elf to Emily. His looks &s;ufficiently
declared his re&s;entment; but that he &s;hould
forbear to renew a mention of the &s;ubject
of it, exceedingly &s;urpri&s;ed her, who was
no le&s;s a&s;toni&s;hed, that, during three days,
Count Morano neither vi&s;ited Montoni, or
was named by him. Several conjectures
aro&s;e in her mind. Sometimes &s;he feared
that the di&s;pute between them had been
revived, and had ended fatally to the Count.
Sometimes &s;he was inclined to hope, that
wearine&s;s, or di&s;gu&s;t at her firm rejuction of
his &s;uit had induced him to relinqui&s;h it;
and, at others, &s;he &s;u&s;pected that he had
now recour&s;e to &s;tratagem, and forbore his
vi&s;its, and prevailed with Montoni to for|bear
the repetition of his name, in the expec|tation
that gratitude and genero&s;ity would
prevail with her to give him the con&s;ent,
which he could not hope from love.</P>
<P>Thus pa&s;&s;ed the time in vain conjecture
<PB N="116" REF="118">
and alternate hopes and fears, till the day
arrived when Montoni was to &s;et out for
the villa of Miarenti, which, like the pre|ceding
ones, neither brought the Count, or
the mention of him.</P>
<P>Montoni having determined not to leave
Venice, till towards evening, that he might
avoid the heats, and catch the cool breezes
of night, embarked about an hour before
&s;un-&s;et, with his family, in a barge, for the
Brenta. Emily &s;at alone near the &s;tern of
the ve&s;&s;el, and, as it floated &s;lowly on,
watched the hay and lofty city le&s;&s;ening
from her view, till its places &s;eemed to
&s;ink in the di&s;tant waves, while its loftier
towers and domes, illumined by the declin|ing
&s;un, appeared on the horizon, like tho&s;e
far-&s;een clouds which, in more northern
climes, often linger on the we&s;tern verge,
and catch the la&s;t light of a &s;ummeer's even|ing.
Soon after, even the&s;e grew dim, and
faded in di&s;tance from her &s;ight; but &s;he
&s;till &s;at gazing on the va&s;t &s;cene of cloud|le&s;s
&s;ky, and mighty waters; and li&s;tening
<PB N="117" REF="119">
in plea&s;ing awe to the deep-&s;ounding waves,
while, as her eyes glanced over the Adriatic,
towards the oppo&s;ite &s;hores, which were,
however, far beyond the reach of &s;ight, &s;he

As Emily approached the &s;hores of Italy
&s;he began to di&s;criminate the rich fearures
and varied colouring of the land&s;cape|the
purple hills, groves of orange pine and
cypre&s;s, &s;hading magnificent villas, and
towns ri&s;ing among vineyards and plan|tations.
The noble Brenta, pouring its
broad waves in to the &s;ea, now appeared, and, when
&s;he reached its mouth, the barge
&s;topped, that the hor&s;es might be fa&s;tened
which were to tow it up the &s;tream. This
done, Emily gave a la&s;t look to the Adriatic,
and to the dim &s;ail,
<Q><L>&mdash;&startq;That from the &s;ky-mix'd wave</L>
<L>Dawns on the &s;ight,&endq;</L></Q>
and the barge &s;lowly glided between the
green and luxuriant &s;lopes of the river.
The grandeur of the Palladian villas, that
adorn the&s;e &s;hores, was con&s;iderably height|ened
by the &s;etting rays, which threw
&s;trong contra &s;its of light &s;hade upon the
porticos and long arcades, and beamed
a mellow lu&s;tre upon the orangeries and
<PB N="122" REF="124">
the tall groves of pine and cypre&s;s, that over|hung
the buildings. The &s;cent of oranges,
of flowering myrtles, and other odoriferous
plants was diffu&s;ed upon the air, and often,
from the&s;e embowered retreats, a &s;train of
mu&s;ic &s;tole on the calm, and &startq;&s;oftened
into &s;ilence.&endq;</P>
<P>The &s;un now &s;unk below the horizon,
twilight fell over the land&s;cape, and Emily,
wrapt in mu&s;ing &s;ilence, continued to
watch its features gradually vani&s;hing into
ob&s;curity. She remembered her many
happy evenings, when with St. Aubert &s;he
had ob&s;erved the &s;hades of twilight &s;teal
over a &s;cene as beautiful as this, from the
gardens of La Vallée, and a tear fell to the
memory of her father. Her &s;pirits were
&s;oftened into melancholy by the influence
of the hour, by the low murmur of the
wave pa&s;&s;ing under the ve&s;&s;el, and the &s;till|ne&s;s
of the air, that trembled only at inter|vals
with di&s;tant mu&s;ic:- why el&s;e &s;hould
&s;he, at the&s;e moments, have looked on her
attachment to Valancourt with pre&s;ages &s;o
<PB N="123" REF="125">
very afflicting, &s;ince she had but lately re|ceived
letters from him, that had foothed
for a while all her anxieties? It now &s;eemed
to her oppre&s;&s;ed mind, that &s;he had taken
leave of him for ever, and that the coun|tries,
which &s;eparated them, would never
more be re-traced by her. She looked upon
Count Morano with horror, as in &s;ome
degree the cau&s;e of this; but apart from him,
a conviction, if &s;uch that may be
called, which ari&s;es from no proof, and
which &s;he knew not how to account for,
&s;eized her mind-that &s;he &s;hould never &s;ee
Valancourt again. Though &s;he knew, that
neither Morano's &s;olicitations, nor Mon|toni's
commands had lawful power to en|&s;orce
her obedience, &s;he regarded both
with a &s;uper&s;titious dread, that they would
finally prevail.</P>
<P>Lo&s;t in this melancholy reverie, and
&s;hedding frequent tears, Emily was at length
rou&s;ed by Montoni, and &s;he followed him
to the cabin, where refre&s;hments were
&s;pread, and her aunt was &s;eated alone. The
<PB N="124" REF="126">
countenance of Madame Montoni was in|flamed
with re&s;entment, that appeared to
be the con&s;equence of &s;ome conver&s;ation
&s;he had held with her hu&s;band, who regard|ed
her with a kind of &s;ullen di&s;dain, and
both pre&s;erved, for &s;ome time, a haughty
&s;ilence. Montoni then &s;poke to Emily of
Mon&s;. Que&s;nel: &startq;You will not, I hope,
per&s;i&s;t in di&s;claiming your knowledge of
the &s;ubject of my letter to him?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;You had &s;ir, that it was no longer
nece&s;&s;ary for me to di&s;claim it,&endq; &s;aid Emily,
&startq;I had hoped, from your &s;illence, that you
was convinced of your error.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;You have hoped impo&s;&s;ibilities then,&endq;
replied Montoni; &startq;I might as rea&s;onably
have expected to find &s;incerity and uni|formity
of conduct in one of your &s;ex,
as you to convict me of error in this af|fair,&endq;</P>
<P>Emily bllu&s;hed, and was &s;ilent; &s;he now
perceived too clearly, that &s;he had hoped
an impo&s;&s;ibility, for, where no mi&s;take had
been committed no conviction could follow;
<PB N="125" REF="127">
and it was evident, that Montoni's conduct
had not been the con&s;equence of mi&s;take,
but of de&s;ign.</P>
<P>Anxious to e&s;cape from conver&s;ation,
which was both afflicting and humiliating to her, &s;he
&s;oon returned to the deck, and
re&s;umed her &s;tation near the &s;tern, without
apprehen&s;ion of cold, for no vapour ro&s;e
from the water, and the air was dry and
tranquil; here, at lea&s;t, the benevolence
of nature allowed her the quiet which Mon|toni
had denied her el&s;ewhere. It was
now pa&s;t midnight. The &s;tars &s;hed a kind
of twilight, that &s;erved to &s;hew the dark
outline of the &s;hores on either hand, and
the grey &s;urface of the river; till the moon
ro&s;e from behind a high palm grove, and
&s;hed her mellow lu&s;tre over the &s;cene. The
ve&s;&s;el glided &s;moothly on: amid the &s;till|ne&s;s
of the hour Emily heard, now and
then, the &s;olitary voice of the barge-men on
the bank, as they &s;poke to their hor&s;es;
while, from a remote part of the ve&s;&s;el,
with melancholy &s;ong,
<Q><PB N="126" REF="128">
<L>&mdash;&startq;The &s;ailor &s;ooth'd,</L>
<L>Beneath the trembling moon, the midnight wave,&endq;</L></Q></P>
<P>Emily, meanwhile,. anticipated her re|ception
by Mon&s; and Madame Que&s;nel,
con&s;idered what &s;he &s;hould &s;ay on the &s;ub|ject
of La Vallée; and then, to with-hold
her mind from more anxious topics, tried
to amu&s;e her&s;elf by discriminating the faint|drawn
features of the land&s;cape, repo&s;ing
in the moon-light. While her fancy thus
wandered, &s;he &s;aw, at a di&s;tance, a building
peeping between the moon-light trees, and,
as the barge approached, heard voices &s;peak|ing,
and &s;oon di&s;tingui&s;hed the lofty portico
of a villa, over&s;hadowed by groves of pine
and &s;ycamore, which &s;he recollected to be
the &s;ame. that had formerly been pointed
out to her, as belonging to Madame Que&s;|nel's
relative.</P>
<P>The barge &s;topped at a flight of marble
&s;teps, which led up the bank to a lawn.
Lights appeared between &s;ome pillars be|yond
the portico. Montoni &s;ent forward
his &s;ervant, and then di&s;embarked with his
<PB N="127" REF="129">
family. They found Mon&s;. and Madame
Que&s;nel, with a few friends, &s;eated on &s;ofas
in the portico, enjoying the cool breeze of
the night, and eating fruits and ices, while
&s;ome of their &s;ervants at a little di&s;tance, on
the river's bank., were performing a &s;imple
&s;erenade. Emily was now accu&s;tomed to
the way of living in this warm country, and
was not &s;urpri&s;ed to find Mon&s;. and Madame
Que&s;nel in their portico, two hours after
midnight.</P>
<P>The u&s;ual &s;alutations being over, the
company &s;eated them&s;elves in the portico,
and refre&s;hments were brought them from
the adjoining hall, where a banquet was
&s;pread, and &s;ervants attended. When
the bu&s;tle of this meeting had &s;ub&s;ided,
and Emily had recovered from the little
flutter into which it had &s;ingular beauty of
the hall, &s;o perfectly accommodated to the
luxuries of the &s;ea&s;on. It was of white
marble, and the roof, ri&s;ing into an open
cupola, was &s;upported by columns of the
<PB N="128" REF="130">
&s;ame material, Two oppo&s;ite &s;ides of the
appartment, terminating in open porticos ad|mitted
to the hall a full view of the gardens,
and of the river &s;cenery; in the centre a
fountain continually refre&s;hed the air, and
&s;eemed to heighten the fragrance, that
breathed from the &s;urrounding orangeries,
while its da&s;hing waters gave an agreeable
and &s;oothing &s;ound. Etru&s;can lamps, &s;u&s;|pended
from the pillars, diffu&s;ed a brilliant
light over the interior part of the hall,
leaving the remoter porticos to the &s;ofter
lu&s;tre of the moon.</P>
<P>Mon&s;. Que&s;nel talked apart to Montoni
of his own affairs, in his u&s;ual &s;train of
&s;elf-importance; boa&s;ted of his new ac|qui&s;itions,
and then affected to pity &s;ome
di&s;appoinments, which Montoni had lately
&s;u&s;tained. Meanwhile, the latter, who&s;e
pride at lea&s;t enabled him tode&s;pi&s;e &s;uch
vanity as this, and who&s;e de&s;cernment at
once detected under this a&s;&s;umed pity,
the frivolous malignity of Qui&s;nel's mind,
li&s;tened to him in contemptuous &s;ilence,
<PB N="129" REF="131">
till he named his niece, and then they
left the portico, and walked away into the
gardens.</P>
<P>Emily, however, &s;till attended to Madame
Que&s;nel, who &s;poke of France (for even
the name of her native country was dear
to her) and &s;he found &s;ome plea&s;ure in
looking at a per&s;on, who had lately been in
it. That country, too, was inhabited by
Valancourt, and &s;he li&s;tened to the men|tion
of it, with a faint hope, that he al&s;o
would be named. Madame Que&s;nel, who,
when &s;he was in France, had talked with
rapture of Italy, now, that &s;he was in Italy,
talked with equal prai&s;e of France, and en|deavoured
to excite the wonder and the envy
of her auditors by accounts of places, which
they had not been happy enough to &s;ee.
In the&s;e de&s;criptions &s;he not only impo&s;ed
upon them, but upon her&s;elf, for &s;he never
thought a pre&s;ent plea&s;ure equal to one, that
was pa&s;&s;ed; and thus the delicious climate,
the fragrant orangeries and all the luxuries,
which &s;urrounded her, &s;lept unnoticed, while
<PB N="130" REF="132">
her fancy wandered over the di&s;tant &s;cenes
of a northern country.</P>
<P>Emily li&s;tened in vain for the name of
Valancourt. Madame Montoni &s;poke in
her turn of the delights of Venice, and of
the plea&s;ure &s;he expected from vi&s;iting the
fine ca&s;tle of Montoni, on the Apennine;
which latter mention, at lea&s;t was merely a
retaliating boa&s;t, for Emily well knew, that
her aunt had no ta&s;te for &s;olitary grandeur,
and, particularly, for &s;uch as the ca&s;tle of
Udolpho promi&s;ed. Thus the party con|tinued
to conver&s;e, and, as far as civility
would permit, to torture each other by mu|tual
boa&s;ts, while they reclined on &s;ofas in
the portico, and were environed with de|lights
both from nature and art, by which
any hone&s;t minds would have been tempered
to benevolence, and happy imaginations
would have been &s;oothed into enchant|ment.</P>
<P>The dawn, &s;oon after, trembled in the
ea&s;tern horizon, and the light tints of morn|ing,
gradually expanding, &s;hewed the beau|tifully
<PB N="131" REF="133">
declining forms of the Italian moun|tains
and the gleaming land&s;capes, &s;tretched
at their feet. Then the &s;un-beams, &s;hooting
up from behind the hills, &s;pread over the
&s;cene that fine &s;affron tinge, which &s;eems
to impart repo&s;e to all it touches. The
land&s;cape no longer gleamed; all its
glowing colours were revealed, except
that its remoter features were &s;till &s;often|ed
and united in the mi&s;t of di&s;tance, who&s;e
&s;weet effect was heightened to Emily by the
dark verdure of the pines and cypre&s;&s;es,
that over-arched the fore-ground of the
river.</P>
<P>The market people, pa&s;&s;ing with their
boats to Venice, now formed a moving
picture on the Brenta. Mo&s;t of the&s;e had
little painted awnings, to &s;helter their owners
from the &s;un-beams, which, together with the
piles of fruit and flowers, di&s;played beneath,
and the ta&s;teful &s;implicity of the pea&s;ant
girls, who watched the rural trea&s;ures,
rendered them gay and &s;triking objects.
The &s;wift movement of the boats down the
<PB N="132" REF="134">
current, the quick glance of oars in the wa|ter,
and now and then the pa&s;&s;ing chorus of
pea&s;ants, who reclined under the &s;ail of their
little bark, or the tones of &s;ome ru&s;tic in|&s;trument,
played by a girl, as &s;he &s;at near
her &s;ylvan cargo, heightened the animation
and fe&s;tivity of the &s;cene.</P>
<P>When Montoni and M. Que&s;nel had
joined the ladies, the party left the portico
for the gardens, where the charming &s;cenery
&s;oon withdrew Emily's thoughts from pain|ful
&s;ubjects. The maje&s;tic forms and rich
verdure of cypre&s;&s;es &s;he had never &s;een
&s;o perfect before: groves of cedar, lemon,
and orange, the &s;piry clu&s;ters fo the pine
and poplar, the luxuriant che&s;nut and
oriental plane, threw all their pomp of &s;hade
over the&s;e gardens; while bowers of flower|ing
myrtle and other &s;picy &s;hrubs mingled
their fragrance with that of flowers, who&s;e
vivid and various colouring glowed with
increa&s;ed effect beneath the contra&s;ted um|brage
of the groves. The air al&s;o was con|tinually
refre&s;hed by rivulets, which, with
<PB N="133" REF="135">
more ta&s;te than fa&s;hion, had been &s;uffered
to wander among the green rece&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>Emily often lingered behind the party,
to contemplate the di&s;tant land&s;cape, that
clo&s;ed a vi&s;ta, or that gleamed beneath the
dark foliage of the foreground;- the &s;piral
&s;ummits of the mountains, touched with a
purple tint, broken and &s;teep above, but
&s;helving gradually to their ba&s;e; the open
valley, marked by no formal lines of art;
and the tall groves of cypre&s;s, pine and pop|lar,
&s;ometimes embelli&s;hed by a ruined villa,
who&s;e broken columns appeared between
the branches of a pine, that &s;eemed to
droop over their fall.</P>
<P>From other parts of the gardens, the
character of the view was entirely changed,
and the fine &s;olitary beauty of the land&s;cape
&s;hifted for the crowded features and varied
colouring of inhabitation.</P>
<P>The &s;un was now gaining fa&s;t upon the
&s;ky, and the party quitted the gardens, and
retired to repo&s;e.</P>

<P>EMILY &s;eized the fir&s;t opportunity of
conver&s;ing alone with Mon&s;. Que&s;nel, con|cerning
La Vallée. His an&s;wers to her
enquiries were conci&s;e, and delivered with
the air of a man, who is con&s;cious of po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ing
ab&s;olute power and impatient of
hearing it que&s;tioned. He declared, that
the di&s;po&s;al of the place was a nece&s;&s;ary

the purport of the note &s;he had inclo&s;ed in
montoni's letter, he appeared to have &s;ome
private rea&s;on for di&s;believing her a&s;&s;ertion,
and, for a con&s;iderable time, per&s;evered in
accu&s;ing her of capricious conduct. Being,
at length, however, convinced, that &s;he
really di&s;liked Morano and had po&s;itively
rejected his &s;uit, his re&s;entment was extra|vagant,

a nobleman, who&s;e title he had affected to
forget, he was incapable of feeling pity for
whatever &s;ufferings of his niece might &s;tand
in the way of his ambition.</P>
<P>Emily &s;aw at once in his manner all the
difficulties, that awaited her, and though no
oppre&s;&s;ion could have power to make her
renounce Valancourt for Morano, her for|titude
<PB N="136" REF="138">
now trembled at an encounter with
the violent pa&s;&s;ions of her uncle.</P>
<P>She oppo&s;ed his turbulence and indigna|tion
only by the mild dignity of a &s;upe|rior
mind; but the gentle firmne&s;s of her
conduct &s;erved to exa&s;perate &s;till more his
re&s;entment, &s;ince it compelled him to feel
his own inferiority, and, when he left her,
he declared, that if &s;he per&s;i&s;ted in her
folly, both him&s;elf and Montoni would
abandon her to the contempt of the world.</P>
<P>The calmne&s;,s &s;he had a&s;&s;umed in his
pre&s;ence failed Emily, when alone, and &s;he
wept bitterly, and called frequently upon
the name of her departed father, who&s;e
advice to her from his death-bed &s;he then
remembered. &startq;Alas!&endq; &s;aid &s;he,&startq;I do
indeed perceive how much more valuable
is the &s;trength of fortitude than the grace
of &s;en&s;ibility, and I will al&s;o endeavour to
fulfil the promi&s;e I then made; I will not
indulge in unavailing lamentaton, but will
try to endure, with firmne&s;s the oppre&s;ion
I cannot elude.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="137" REF="139">
Somewhat &s;oothed by the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s
of performing a part of St. Aubert's la&s;t re|que&s;t,
and of endeavouring to pur&s;ue the
conduct which he would have approved,
the overcame her tears, and when the com|pany
met at dinner, had recovered her u&s;ual
&s;erenity of countenance.</P>
<P>In the cool of the evening, the ladies
took the <HI>fersco</HI> along the bank of the Brenra
in Madame Que&s;nel's carriage. The &s;tate
of Emily's mind was in melancholy contra&s;t
with the gay groups a&s;&s;embled beneath the
&s;hades that overhung this enchanting &s;tream.
Some were dancing under the trees, and
others reclining on the gra&s;s, taking ices
and coffee and calmly enjoying the effect
of a beautiful evening, on a luxuriant land|&s;cape,
when &s;he looked at the &s;now-capt.
Apennines, a&s;cending in the di&s;|tance,
thought of Montoni's ca&s;tle' and
&s;uffered &s;ome terror, le&s;t he &s;hould convey
her thither, for the purpo&s;e of enforcing her
obedience; but the thought vani&s;hed, when
&s;he con&s;idered, that &s;e was as much in
<PB N="138" REF="140">
his power at Venice as &s;he could be èl&s;e|where.</P>
<P>It was moonlight before the party re|turned
to the villa, where &s;upper was &s;pread
in the airy hall, which had &s;o much enchant|ed
Emily's fancy, on the preceding night.
The ladies &s;eated them&s;elves in the portico,
till Mon&s;. Que&s;nel, Montoni and other gen|tlemen,
&s;hould join them at table, and Emily
endeavoured to re&s;ign her&s;elf to the tranquil|lity
of the hour. Per&s;ently, a barge &s;topped
at the &s;teps that led into the gardens, and
&s;oon after, &s;he di&s;tingui&s;hed, the voices of
Montoni and Que&s;nel, and then that of
Morano, who, in the next moment, appear|ed.
Hi&s; compliment&s; &s;he received in &s;i|lence,
and her cold air &s;eemed at fir&s;t to
di&s;compo&s; him; but he &s;oon recovered his
u&s;ual gaiety of manner, though the officious
kindne&s;s of M.and Madame Que&s;nel Emily
perceived di&s;gu&s;ted him. &s;uch a degree of
attention &s;he had &s;carcely believed could be
&s;hewn by M. Que&s;nel, for &s;he had never
before &s;een him otherwi&s;e than in the pre|&s;ence
of his inferiors or equals.</P>
<P><PB N="139" REF="141">
When &s;he could retire to her own apart|ment,
her mind almo&s;t
involuntarily dwelt
on the mo&s;t probable means of prevailing
with the Count to withdraw his &s;uit, and to
her liberal mind none appeared more pro|bable,
than that of acknowledging to him a
prior attachment and throwing her&s;elf upon
hi&s; genero&s;ity for a relea&s;e. When, how|ever,
on the following day, he renewed his
addre&s;&s;es, &s;he &s;hrunk from the adoption of
the plan &s;he had formed. There wa&s; &s;ome|thing
&s;o repugnant to her ju&s;t pride, in
laying open the &s;ecret of her heart to &s;uch
a man as Morano, and in &s;uing to him for
compa&s;&s;ion, that &s;he impatiently rejected thi&s;
de&s;ign and wondered, that &s;he could have
pau&s;ed upon it for a moment. The rejec|tion
of his &s;uit &s;he repeated in the mo&s;t
deci&s;ive terms &s;he could &s;elect, mingling
with it a &s;evere con&s;ure of his conduct;
but, though the Count appeared morti|fied
by this, he per&s;evered in the mo&s;t ar|dent
profe&s;&s;ions of admiration, till he
<PB N="140" REF="142">
was interrupted and Emily relea&s;ed by the
pre&s;ence of Madame Que&s;nel.</P>
<P>during her &s;tay at this plea&s;ant villa,
Emily wa&s; thus rendered mi&s;erable by the
a&s;&s;iduities of Morano, together with the
cruelly exerted authority of M. Que&s;nel
and Montoni, who with her aunt, &s;eemed
now more re&s;olutely determined upon this
marriage than they had even appeared to be
at Venice. M. Que&s;nel, finding, that both
argument and menace were ineffectual in
enforcing an immediate conclu&s;ion to it,
at length relinqui&s;hed his endeavours, and
tru&s;ted to the power of Montoni and to the
cour&s;e of events at Venice. Emily, indeed,
looked to Venice with hope, for there &s;he
would be relieved in &s;ome mea&s;ure from
the per&s;ecution of Morano, who would no
longer be an inhabitant of the &s;ame hou&s;e
with her&s;elf, and from that of Montoni,
who&s;e engagements would not permit him
to be continually at home. But amid&s;t the
pre&s;&s;ure of her own misfortunes, &s;he did
not forget tho&s;e of poor There&s;a, for whom
<PB N="141" REF="143">
&s;he pleaded with courageous tenderness to
Que&s;nel, who promi&s;ed, in &s;light and ge|neral
terms, that &s;he &s;hould not be for|gotten.</P>
<P>Montoni, in a long conver&s;ation with
M. Que&s;nel, arranged the plan to be pur|&s;ued
re&s;pecting Emily, and M. Que&s;nel
propo&s;ed to be at Venice, as &s;oon as he
&s;hould be informed, that the nuptials were
concluded.</P>
<P>It wa&s; new to Emily to part with any
per&s;on, with whom &s;he wa&s; connected, with|out
feelings of regret; the moment, how|ever,
in which &s;he took leave of M.and
Madame Que&s;nel, was, perhaps, the only
&s;ati&s;factory one &s;he had known in their
pre&s;ence.</P>
<P>Morano returned in Montoni's barge,
and Emily, as &s;he watched her gradual ap|proach
to that magic city, &s;aw at her &s;ide
the only per&s;on, who occa&s;ioned her to
view it with le&s;s than perfect delight. They
arrived there about midnight, when Emily
wa&s; relea&s;ed from the pre&s;ence of the Count,
<PB N="142" REF="144">
who, with Montoni, went to a Ca&s;ino, and
&s;he wa&s; &s;uffered to retire to her own apart|ment.</P>
<P>On the following day, Montoni, in a
&s;hort conver&s;ation, which he held with
Emily, informed her, that he would no
longer be <HI>trifled</HI> with, and that, &s;ince her
marriage with the Count would be &s;o highly
advantageous to her, that folly only could
object to it, and folly of &s;uch extent as wa&s;
incapable of conviction, it &s;hould be ce|lebrated
without further delay, and, if that
wa&s; nece&s;&s;ary, without her con&s;ent.</P>
<P>Emily, who had hitherto tried remon|&s;trance,
had now recour&s;e to &s;upplication,
for di&s;tre&s;s prevented her from fore&s;eeing,
that with a man of Montoni's di&s;po&s;ition,
&s;upplication would be equally u&s;ele&s;s. She
afterwards enquired by what right he ex|erted
this unlimited authority over her!
a que&s;tion, which her better judgment
would have with-held her, in a calmer mo|ment,
from making, &s;ince it could avail
her nothing, and would afford Montoni
<PB N="143" REF="145">
another opportunity of triumphing over her
defencele&s;s condition.</P>
<P>&startq;By what right!&endq; cried Montoni,
with a malicious &s;mile, &startq;by the right of
my will; if you can elude that, I will not
enquire by what right you do &s;o. I now
remind you, for the la&s;t time, that you are
a &s;tranger, in a foreign country, and that
it is your intere&s;t to make me your friend;
you know the means; if you compel me
to become your enemy- I will venture
to tell you, that the puni&s;hment &s;hall ex|ceed
your expectation. You may know
I am not to be trifled with.&endq;</P>
<P>Emily continued, for &s;ome time after
Montoni had left her, in a &s;tate of de&s;pair,
or rather of &s;tupefaction; a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s
of mi&s;ery wa&s; all that remained in her mind.
in this &s;ituation Madame Montoni found
her, at the &s;ound of who&s;e voice Emily
looked up, and her aunt, &s;omewhat &s;oftened
by the expre&s;&s;ion of de&s;pair, that fixed her
countenance, &s;poke in a manner more kind
than &s;he had ever yet done. Emily's heart
<PB N="144" REF="146">
was touched; &s;he &s;hed tears, and, after
weeping for &s;ome time, recovered &s;uffi|cient
compo&s;ure to &s;peak on the &s;ubject of
her di&s;tre&s;s, and to endeavour to intere&s;t
Madame Montoni in her behalf. But,
though the compa&s;&s;ion of her aunt had
been &s;urpri&s;ed, her ambition wa&s; not to be
overcome, and her pre&s;ent object wa&s; to be
the aunt of a Counte&s;s. Emily's efforts,
therefore, were as un&s;ucce&s;&s;ful as they had
been with Montoni, and &s;he withdrew to
her apartment to think and weep alone.
How often did &s;he remember the parting
&s;cence with Valancourt, Montoni's character
with le&s;s re&s;erve! When her mind, however,
had recovered from the fir&s;t &s;hock of this
behavior, &s;he con&s;idered, that it would be
impo&s;&s;ible for him to compel her alliance
with Morano, if &s;he per&s;i&s;ted in refu&s;ing
to repeat any part of the marriage cere|money;
and &s;he per&s;evered in her re&s;olu|tion
to await Montoni's threatened ven|geance
rather than give her&s;elf for life to a
<PB N="145" REF="147">
man, whom &s;he mu&s;t have de&s;pi&s;ed for his
pre&s;ent conduct, had &s;he never even loved
Valancourt: yet &s;he trembled at the re|venge
&s;he thus re&s;olved to brave.</P>
<P>An affair, however, &s;oon after occurred,
which &s;omewhat called off Montoni's at|tention
from Emily. The my&s;terious vi&s;its
of Or&s;ino were renewed with more fre|quency
&s;ince the return of the former to
Venice. There were others, al&s;o, be&s;ides
Or&s;ino, admitted to the&s;e midnight coun|cils,
and among them Cavigni and Verezzi|Montoni
became more re&s;erved and au&s;tere
in his manner than ever; and Emily, regard|le&s;s
of his, might have perceived, that &s;ome|thing
extraordinary wa&s; working in his
Mind.</P>
<P>One night, on which a council wa&s; not
held, Or&s;ino came in great agitation of
&s;pirits, and di&s;patched his con&s;idential &s;er|vant
to Montoni, who wa&s; at a Ca&s;ino,
de&s;iring; that he would return home imme|diately;
but charging the &s;ervant not to
<PB N="146" REF="148">
mention his name. Montoni obeyed the
&s;ummon, and, on meeting Or&s;ino, wa&s; in|formed
of the circum&s;tances, that occa&s;ioned
his vi&s;it and his vi&s;ible alarm, with a part
of which he wa&s; already acquainted.</P>
<P>A venetian nobleman, who had, on
&s;ome late occa&s;ion, provoked the hatred
of O&s;ino, had been way-laid and poniarded
by hired a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins: and, as the murdered
per&s;on wa&s; of the fir&s;t connections, the Se|nate
had taken up the affair. One of the
Sa&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins wa&s; now apprehended, who had
con&s;e&s;&s;ed, that Or&s;ino wa&s; his employer in
the atrocious deed; and the latter, informed
of his danger, had now come to montoni to
con&s;ult on the mea&s;ures nece&s;&s;ary to favour
his e&s;cape. He knew, that, at thi&s; time, the
officers of the police were upon the watch
for him, all over the city; to leave it, at
pre&s;ent, therefore wa&s; impracticable, and
Montoni con&s;ented to &s;ecrete him for a few
days till the vigilance of ju&s;tice &s;hould re|lax,
and then to a&s;&s;i&s;t him in quitting Ve|nice.
He knew the danger he him&s;elf in|curred
<PB N="147" REF="149">
by permitting Or&s;ino to remain in
his hou&s;e, but &s;uch wa&s; the nature of his
obligations to this man, that he did not
think it prudent to refu&s;e him an a&s;ylum.
&s;uch wa&s; the per&s;on whom Montoni had
admitted to his confidence, and for whom
he felt as much friend&s;hip as was compa|tible
with his character.</P>
<P>While Or&s;ino remained concealed in his
hou&s;e, Montoni was unwilling to attract pub|lic
ob&s;ervation by the nuptials of Count Mo|rano;
but this ob&s;tacle was, in a few days,
overcome by the departure of his criminal
vi&s;itor, and he then informed Emily, that her
marriage wa&s; to be celebrated on the follow|ing
morning. To her repeated a&s;&s;urances, that
it &s;hould not take place, he replied only by a
a malignant &s;mile; and,telling her, that the
<PB N="148" REF="150">
Count and a prie&s;t would be at his hou&s;e,
early in the morning, he advi&s;ed her no fur|ther
to dare hi&s; re&s;entment, by oppo&s;ition to
hi&s; will and to her own intere&s;t. &startq;I am now
going out for the evening,&endq; &s;aid he, &startq;re|member,
that I &s;hall give your hand to
Count Morano in the morning.&endq; Emily,
having, ever &s;ince hi&s; late threats, expected,
that her trails would at length arrive to
this cri&s;is, was le&s;s &s;hocked by the decla|ration,
than &s;he otherwi&s;e would have been,
and &s;he endeavoured to &s;upport her&s;elf by
the belief, that the marriage could not be
valid, &s;o long as &s;he refu&s;ed before the prie&s;t
to repeat any part of the ceremony. Yet,
as the moment of trail approached, her
long-hara&s;&s;ed &s;pirits &s;hrunk almo&s;t equally
from the encounter of hi&s; vengeance, and
from the hand of Count Morano. She was
not even perfectly certain of the con&s;equence
of her &s;teady refu&s;al at the altar, and &s;he
trembled, more than ever, at the power of
Montoni, which &s;eemed unlimited as his
will, for &s;he &s;aw, that he would not &s;cruple
to tran&s;gre&s;s any law, if, by &s;o doing, he
could accompli&s;h his project.</P>
<P>While her mind was thus &s;uffering and in
a &s;tate little &s;hort of di&s;traction, &s;he wa&s; in|formed
that Morano a&s;ked permi&s;&s;ion to fee
her, and the &s;ervant had &s;carcely departed
<PB N="149" REF="151">
with an excu&s;e, before &s;he repented that
&s;he had &s;ent one. In the next moment,
reverting to her former de&s;ign, and deter|mining
to try, whether expo&s;tulation and
entreaty would not &s;ucceed, where a refu&s;al
and a ju&s;t di&s;dain had failed, &s;he recalled
the &s;ervant, and, &s;ending a different me&s;&s;age,
prepared to go down to the Count.</P>
<P>The dignity and a&s;&s;umed compo&s;ure with
which &s;he met him, and the kind of pen&s;ive
re&s;ignation, that &s;oftened her countenance,
were circum&s;tances not likely to induce him
to relinqui&s;h her, &s;erving, as they did, to
heighten a pa&s;&s;ion, which had already in|toxicated
his judgment. He li&s;tened to
all &s;he &s;aid with an appearance of compla|cency
and of a wi&s;h to oblige her; but
his re&s;olution remained invariably the &s;ame,
and he endeavoured to win her admiration
by every in&s;inuating art he &s;o well knew
how to practi&s;e. Being, at length, a&s;&s;ured
that &s;he had nothing to hope from his
ju&s;tice, &s;he repeated, in a &s;olemn and im|pre&s;&s;ive
<PB N="150" REF="152">
manner, her ab&s;olute rejection of his
&s;uit, and quitted him with an a&s;&s;urance, that
her refu&s;al would be effectually maintained
again&s;t every circum&s;tance, that could be
imagined for &s;ubduing it. A ju&s;t pride had
re&s;rained her tears in his pre&s;ence, but now
they flowed from the fulne&s;s of her heart.
She often called upon the name of her late
father, and often dwelt with unutterable
angui&s;h on the idea of Valancourt.</P>
<P>She did not go down to &s;upper, but re|mained
alone in her apartment, &s;ometimes
yielding to the influence of grief and terror,
and, at others, endeavouring to fortify her
mind again&s;t them, and to prepare her&s;elf
to meet, with compo&s;ed courage, the &s;cene
of the following morning, when all the
&s;tratagem of Morano and the violence of
Montoni would be united again&s;t her.</P>
<P>The evening was far advanced, when
Madame Montoni came to her chamber
With from bridal ornaments, which the
Count had &s;ent to Emily. She had, this
<PB N="151" REF="153">
day, purpo&s;ely avoided her niece; perhaps,
becau&s;e her u&s;ual in&s;en&s;ibility failed her,
and &s;he feared to tru&s;t her&s;elf with a view of
Emily's di&s;tre&s;s; or po&s;&s;ibly, though her con|&s;cience
was &s;eldom audible, it now reproach|ed
her with her conduct to her brother's or|phan
child, who&s;e happine&s;s had been
entru&s;ted to her care by a dying father.</P>
<P>Emily could not look at the&s;e pre&s;ents,
and made a la&s;t, though almo&s;t hopele&s;s,
effort to intere&s;t the compa&s;&s;ion of Madame
Montoni, who, if &s;he did feel any degree
of pity, or remor&s;e, &s;ucce&s;sfully concealed
being mi&s;erable, concerning a marriage,
which ought only to make her happy,&endq;I
am &s;ure,&startq;&s;aid &s;he,&startq;if I was unmarried,
and the Count had propo&s;ed to me, I &s;hould
have been flattered by the di&s;tinction: and
if I &s;hould have been &s;o, I am &s;ure, niece,
you, who have no fortune, ought to feel
your&s;elf highly honoured, and &s;hew a pro|per
gratitude and humility towards the
<PB N="152" REF="154">
Count, for his conde&s;cen&s;ion. I am often
&s;urpri&s;ed, I mu&s;t own, to ob&s;erve how
humbly he deports him&s;elf to you, not|with&s;tanding
the haughty airs you give
your&s;elf; I wonder he has patience to hu|mour
you &s;o: if I was he, I know, I &s;hould
often be ready to reprehend you, and make
you know your&s;elf a little better. I would
not have flattered you, I can tell you, for
it is this ab&s;urd flattery that makes you
fancy your&s;elf of &s;o much con&s;equence, that
you think nobody can de&s;erve you, and I
often tell the Count &s;o, for I have no pa|tience
to hear him to pay you &s;uch extra|vagant
compliments, which you believe
every word of!&endq;</P>
<P>"Your patience, madam, cannot &s;uffer
more cruelly on &s;uch occa&s;ions, than my
own,&startq;&s;aid Emily.</P>
<P>&startq;o! that is all mere affectation,&endq;re|joined
her aunt.&startq;I know that his flattery
delights you' and makes you &s;o vain, that
you think you may have the whole world
at your feet. But you are very much mi&s;|taken;
<PB N="153" REF="155">
I can a&s;&s;ure you, niece, you will
not meet with many &s;uch &s;uitors as the
Count: every other per&s;on would have turned
upon his heel, and left you to repent at your
lie&s;ure, long ago.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;o that the Count had re&s;embled every
other per&s;on, then!&endq;&s;aid Emily, with a
heavy &s;igh.</P>
<P>&startq;It is happy for you, that he does not,&endq;
rejoined Madame Montoni;&startq;and what I
am now &s;aying is from pure kindne&s;s. I am
endeavouring to convince you of your good
fortune, and to per&s;uade you to &s;ubmit to
nece&s;&s;ity with a good grace. It is nothing
to me, you know, whether you like this
marriage or not, for it mu&s;t be; what I &s;ay,
therefore, is from pure kindne&s;s. I wi&s;h to
fee you happy, and it is your own &s;ault if
you are not &s;o. I would a&s;k you, now,
&s;eriou&s;ly and calmly, what kind of a match
you can expect, &s;ince a Count cannot con|tent
your ambition?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I have no ambition whatever, ma|dam,&endq;
<PB N="154" REF="156">
replied Emily,&startq;my only wi&s;h is
to remain in my pre&s;ent &s;tation.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;o! that is &s;peaking quite from the
purpo&s;e,&endq;&s;aid her aunt,&startq;I fee you are
&s;till thinking of Mon&s;. Valancourt. Pray
get rid of all tho&s;e fanta&s;tic notions about
love, and this ridiculous pride, and be
&s;omething like reasonable creature. But,
however, this is nothing to the purpo&s;e|for
your marriage with the Count takes
place to-morrow, you know, whether you
approve it or not. The Count will be tri&s;led
with no longer.&endq;</P>
<P>Emily maid no attempt to reply to this
curious &s;peech; &s;he felt it would be mean,
and &s;he knew it wold be u&s;ele&s;s. Ma|dame
Montoni laid down the Count's pre&s;ents
upon the table, on which Emily was lean|ing,
and, then, de&s;iring &s;he would be ready
early in the morning, bade her good-night.
&startq;Good-night madam,&endq;&s;aid Emily, with
a deep &s;igh, as the door clo&s;ed upon her
aunt, and &s;he was left once more to her

own fad reflections. For &s;ome time &s;he fat
&s;o lo&s;t in thought, as to be wholly uncon|&s;cious
where &s;he was; at length, rai&s;ing
her head, and looking round the room,
its gloom and profound &s;tillne&s;s awed her.
She fixed her eyes on the door, through
which her aunt had di&s;appeared, and li&s;t|ened
anxiou&s;ly for &s;ome found, that might
relieve the deep dejection of her &s;pirits; but
it was pa&s;t midnight, and all the family,
except the &s;ervant, who &s;at up for Montoni,
had retired to bed. Her mind, long ha|ra&s;&s;ed
by di&s;tre&s;s, now yielded to imaginary
terrors; &s;he trembled to look into the ob|&s;curity
of her &s;pacious chamber, and feared
&s;he knew not what; a &s;tate of mind, which
continued &s;o long, that &s;he would have
called up Annette, her aunt's woman, had
her fear permitted her to ri&s;e from her
chair, and to cro&s;s the apartment.</P>
<P>The&s;e melancholy at length be|gan
to di&s;per&s;e, and &s;he retired to her bed,
not to &s;leep, for that was &s;carcely po&s;&s;ible,
<PB N="156" REF="158">
but to try, at lea&s;t, to quiet her di&s;turbed
fancy, and to collect &s;trength of &s;pirits &s;uf|ficient
to bear her through the &s;cene of the
approaching morning.</P>

<P>EMILY was recalled from the kind of
&s;lumber, into which &s;he had, at length,
&s;unk, by a quick knocking at her chamber
door. She &s;tarted up in terror, for Mon|toni
and Count Morano in&s;tantly came to
her mind; but, having li&s;tened in &s;ilence
for &s;ome time, and recogni&s;ing the voice of
Annette, &s;he ro&s;e and opened the door.
&startq;What brings you hither &s;o early?&endq;&s;aid
Emily, trembling exce&s;&s;ively. She was un|able
to &s;upport her&s;elf, and &s;at down on
the bed.</P>
<P><PB N="158" REF="160">
&startq;Dear ma'am&s;elle!&endq;&s;aid Annette,&startq;do
not look for pale. I am quite frightened to
&s;ee you. Here is a fine bu&s;tle below &s;tairs,
all the &s;ervants running to and fro, and
none of them fa&s;t enough! Here is a bu&s;tle,
indeed, all of a &s;udden, and nobody knows
for what!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Who is below be&s;ides them?&endq;&s;aid
Emily,&startq;Annette, do not trifle with me!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Not for the world, ma'am&s;elle, I
would not trifle for the world; but one can|not
help making one's remarks, and there
is the signor in &s;uch a bu&s;tle, as I never &s;aw
ma'am, to get ready immediately.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Good God &s;upport me!&endq;cried Emily,
almo&s;t &s;ainting,&startq;Count Morano is below,
then!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;No, ma'am&s;elle, he is not below that
I know of,&endq;replied Annette,&startq;only his
Excellenza &s;ent me to de&s;ire you would get
ready directly to leave Venice, for that the
gondolas would be at the &s;teps of the canal
in a few minutes: but I must hurry back
<PB N="159" REF="161">
to my lady, who is just at her wits end,
and knows not which way to turn for
ha&s;te.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Explain, Annette, explain the mean|ing
of all this before you go,&endq;&s;aid Emily,
&s;o overcome with &s;urpri&s;e and timid hope,
that she had &s;carcely breath to &s;peak.</P>
<P>&startq;Nay. Ma'am&s;elle, that is more than
I can do. I only know that the Signor is
ju&s;t come home in a very ill humour, that
he has had us all called out of our beds,
and tells us we are all to leave Venice im|mediately.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Is Count Morano to go with the Sig|nor?&endq;
&s;aid Emily,&startq;and whither are we
going?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I know neither, ma'am for certain;
but I heard Ludovico &s;ay &s;omething about
going, after we got to Terra-firma, to the
Signor's ca&s;tle among &s;ome mountains, that
he talked of.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;The Apennines!&endq;&s;aid Emily, eagerly,
&startq;o! then I have little to hope!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;That is the very place, ma'am. But
<PB N="160" REF="162">
cheer up, and do not take it &s;o much to
heart, and think what a little time you
have to get ready in, and how impatient
the Signor is. Holy St. Mark! I hear
the oars of the canal; and now they come
nearer, and now they are da&s;hing at the &s;teps
below; it is gondola, &s;ure enough.&endq;</P>
<P>Aannette ha&s;tened from the room; and
Emily prepared for this unexpected flight
as fa&s;t as her trembling hands would per|mit,
not perceiving, that any change in her
&s;ituation could po&s;&s;ibly be for the wor&s;e.
She had &s;carcely thrown her books and
clothes into her travelling trunk, when, re|ceiving
a &s;econds &s;ummons, &s;he went down
to her aunt's dre&s;&s;ing room, where &s;he found
Montoni impatiently reproving his wife
for delay. He went out, &s;oon after, to give
&s;ome further orders to his people, and
Emily then enquired the occa&s;ion of this
ha&s;ty journey; but her aunt appeared to be
as ignorant as her&s;elf, and to undertake the
journey with more reluctance.</P>
<P>The family at length embarked, but nei|ther
<PB N="161" REF="163">
Count Morano, or Cavigni, was of
the party. Somewhat received by ob&s;erving
this, Emily, when the gondolieri da&s;hed
their oars in the water, and put of from the
&s;teps of the portico, felt like a criminal, who
receive a &s;hort reprieve. Her heart beat yet
lighter, when hey emerged from the canal
into the ocean, and lighter &s;till, when they
&s;kimmed pa&s;t the walls of St. Marks, with|out
having &s;topped to take up Count Mo|rano.</P>
<P>The dawn now began to tint the horizon,
and to break upon the &s;hores of the Adri|atic.
Emily did not venture to a&s;k any
que&s;tions of Montoni, who &s;at, for &s;ome
time, in gloomy &s;ilence, and then rolled
him&s;elf up in his cloak, as if to &s;leep, while
Madame Montoni did the fame; but Emily,
who could not &s;leep, undrew one of the little
curtains of the gandola, and looked out
upon the &s;ea. The ri&s;ing dawn now enlight|ened
the mountain-tops of Fruili, but their
lower &s;ides, and the di&s;tant waves, that
rolled at their feet, were &s;till in deep &s;hadow.
<PB N="162" REF="164">
Emily, &s;unk tranquil melancholy, watched
the &s;trengthening light &s;preading upon the
ocean, &s;hewing &s;ucce&s;&s;ively Venice and her
i&s;lets, and the &s;hores of Italy, along which
boats, with their pointed latin fails, began
to move.</P>
<P>The gondolieri were frequently hailed,
at this early hour, by the market people, as
they glided by towards Venice, and the
Lagune &s;oon di&s;played the gay &s;cene of innu|merable
little barks, paffing from Terra-firma
with provi&s;ions. Emily gave a last look
to that &s;plendid city, but her mind was
then occupied by con&s;idering the probable
events, that awaited her, in the &s;cenes, to
which &s;he was removing, and with conjec|tures,
concerning the motive of this &s;udden
journey. It appeared, upon calmer confide|ration,
that montoni was removing her to
his &s;ecluded ca&s;tle, becau&s;e he could there,
with more probability of &s;ucce&s;s, attempt to
terrify her into obedience; or that, &s;hould
its gloomy and &s;eque&s;tered &s;cenes fail of
this effect, her forced marriage with the
<PB N="163" REF="165">
Count could there be &s;olemnized with
the &s;ecrecy, which was nece&s;&s;ary to the ho|nour
of Montoni. The little &s;pirit, which
this reprieve had recalled, now began to
fail, and, when Emily reached the &s;hore,
her mind had &s;unk into all its former de|pre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Montoni did not embark on the Brenta,
but per&s;uad his way in carriages acro&s;s the
country, towards the Apennine; during
which journey, his manner to Emily was
&s;o particularly &s;evere, that this alone would
have confirmed her conjecture, had any
&s;uch confirmation been nece&s;&s;ary. Her
&s;en&s;es were now dead to the beautiful coun|try,
through which &s;he traveled. Sometimes
&s;he was compelled to &s;mile at the naivet
of Annette, in her remarks on what &s;he
&s;aw, and &s;ometimes to &s;igh, as a &s;cene of
peculiar beauty recalled Valancourt to her
thoughts, who was indeed &s;eldom ab&s;ent
from them, and of whom &s;he could never
hope to hear in the &s;olitude, to which &s;he
was ha&s;tening.</P>
<P><PB N="164" REF="166">
At length, the travellers began to a&s;cend
among the Apennines. The immen&s;e pine|fore&s;ts,
which, at the period, overhung
the&s;e mountains, and between which the
road wound, excluded all view but of the
cliffs a&s;piring above, except, that, now and
then an opening through the dark woods
allowed the eye a momentary glimp&s;e of
the country below. The gloom of the&s;e
&s;hades, their &s;olitary &s;ilence, except when
the breeze &s;wept over their &s;ummits, the
tremendous precipices of the mountains,
that came partially to the eye, each a&s;&s;i&s;ted
to rai&s;e the &s;olemnity of Emily's feelings
into awe; &s;he &s;aw only images of gloomy
grandeur, or of dreadful &s;ublimity, around
her; other images, equally gloomy and
equally terrible, gleamed on her imagina|tion.
She was going &s;carcely knew
whither, under the dominion of a per&s;on,
from who&s;e arbitrary di&s;po&s;ition &s;he had
already &s;uffered &s;o much, to marry, per|haps,
a man who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed neither her af|fection,
or e&s;teem; or to endure, beyond
<PB N="165" REF="167">
the hope of &s;uccour, whatever puni&s;hment re|venge,
and that Italian revenge, might dictate.
&mdash;The more &s;he con&s;idered what might be
the motive of the journey, the more &s;he
became convinced, that it was for the pur|po&s;e
of concluding her nuptials with Count
Morano, with that &s;ecrecy which her re&s;o|lute
re&s;i&s;tance had made nece&s;&s;ary to te
honour, if not to be &s;afety,&startq;of Montoni.
From the deep &s;olitudes, into which &s;he was
immerging, and from the gloomy ca&s;tle,
of which &s;he had heard &s;ome &s;ysterious
hints, her &s;ick heart recoiled de&s;pair,
and &s;he experienced, that, though her mind
was already occupied by peculiar di&s;tre&s;s,
it was &s;till alive to the influence of new and
local circum&s;tance; why el&s;e did &s;he &s;hud|der
at the idea of this de&s;olate ca&s;tle?</P>
<P>As the travelers &s;till a&s;cended among the
pine fore&s;ts, &s;teep ro&s;e over &s;teep, the moun|tains
&s;eemed to multiply, as they went, and
what was the &s;ummit of one eminence
proved to be only the ba&s;e of another, At
length, they reached a little plain, where
<PB N="166" REF="168">
the drivers &s;topped to re&s;t the mules, whence
a &s;cene of &s;uch extent and magnificence
opened below, as drew even from Madame
Montoni a note of admiration. Emily
lo&s;t, for a moments, her &s;orrows, in the im|men&s;ity
of nature. Beyond the amphi|theatre
of mountains, that &s;treched below,
whose tops appeared as numerous almo&s;t, as
the waves of the &s;ea, and who&s;e feet were
concealed by the fore&s;ts&mdash;extended the
Campagna of Italy, where cities and rivers,
and woods and all the glow of cultivation
were mingled in gay confu&s;ion. The Adri|atic
bounded the horizon, into which the
Po and the Brenta, after winding through
the whole extent of the land&s;cape, poured
their fruitful waves. Emily gazed long on
the &s;plendours of the world &s;he was quitting,
of which the whole magnificence &s;eemed
thus given to her sight only to increa&s;e her
regret on leaving it; for her, Valancourt
alone was in that world; to him alone her
heart turned, and for him alone fell her bit|ter
tears.</P>
<P><PB N="167" REF="169">
From this &s;ublime &s;cene the travellers
continued to a&s;cend among the pines, till they
entered a narrow pa&s;s of the mountains,
which &s;hut out every feature of the di&s;tant
country, and, in its &s;tead, exhibited only tre|mendous
crags, impending over the road,
where no ve&s;tige of humanity, or even of
vegetation, appeared, except here and there
the trunk and &s;cathed branches of an oak,
that hung nearly headlong from the rock,
into which its &s;trong roots had fa&s;tened.
This pa&s;s, which led into the heart of the
Apennine, at length opened to day, and
a &s;cene of mountains &s;tretched in long
per&s;pective, as wild as any the travelers
had yet pa&s;&s;ed. Still va&s;t pine-fore&s;ts
hung upon their ba&s;e, and crowned the
ridgy precipice, that ro&s;e perpendicularly
from the vale, while, above, the rolling
mi&s;ts caught the fun-beams, and touched
their cliffs with all the magical colouring
of light and &s;hade. The &s;cene &s;eemed
perpetually changing, and its features to
a&s;&s;ume new forms, as the winding road
<PB N="168" REF="170">
brought them to the eye in different atti|tudes;
while the &s;hifting vapours, now par|tially
concealing their minuter beauties and
now illuminating them with &s;plendid tints,
a&s;&s;i&s;ted the illu&s;ions of the fight.</P>
<P>Though the deep vallies between the&s;e
mountains were, for the mo&s;t part,
clothed with pines, &s;ometimes an abrupt
opening pre&s;ented a per&s;pective of only
barren rocks, with a cataract fla&s;hing
from their &s;ummit among broken cliffs,
till its waters, reaching the bottom,
foamed along with uncea&s;ing fury; and
&s;ometimes pa&s;toral &s;cenes exhibited their
&startq;green delights&endq;in the narrow vales,
&s;miling amid &s;urrounding horror. There
herds and flocks of gots and &s;heep, brow&s;|ing
under the &s;hade of hanging woods, and
the &s;hepherd's little cabin, reared on the
margin of a clear &s;tream, pre&s;ented a &s;weet
picture of repo&s;e.</P>
<P>Wild and romantic as were the&s;e &s;cenes,
their character had far le&s;s of the &s;ub|lime,
than had tho&s;e of the Alps, which
<PB N="169" REF="171">
guard the entrance of Italy. Emily was
often elevated, but &s;eldom felt tho&s;e emo|ions
of inde&s;cribable awe, which &s;he had &s;o
continually experienced, in her pa&s;'&s;age over
the Alps.</P>
<P>Towards the clo&s;e of day, the road
wound into a deep valley. Mountains,
who&s;e &s;haggy &s;teeps appeared to be inacce&s;&s;i|ble,
almo&s;t &s;rrounded it. To the ea&s;t, a
vi&s;ta opened, that exhibited the Apennines
in their darke&s;t horrors; and the long per|&s;pective
of retiring &s;ummits, ri&s;ing over each
other, their ridges clothed with pines, ex|habited
a &s;tronger image of grandeur, than
any that Emily had yet &s;een. The &s;un had
ju&s;t &s;unk below the top of the mountains &s;he
was de&s;cending, who&s;e long &s;hadow &s;tretch|ed
athwart the valley, but his &s;loping rays,
&s;hooting through an opening of the cliffs,
touched with a yellow gleam the &s;um|mits
of the fore&s;t, that hung upon the op|po&s;ite
&s;teeps, and &s;treamed in full &s;plendour
upon the towers and battlements of a
ca&s;tle, that &s;pred its exten&s;ive ramparts
<PB N="170" REF="172">
along the brow of a precipice above. The
&s;plendour of the&s;e illumined objects was
heightened by the contra&s;ted &s;hade, which
involved the valley below.</P>
<P>&startq;There,&endq;&s;aid Montoni, &s;peaking for
the fir&s; time in &s;everal hours, &startq;is Udol|pho.&endq;</P>
<P>Emily grazed with melancholy awe upon
the ca&s;tle, which &s;he under&s;tood to be
Montoni,s; for, thogh it was now lighted
up by the &s;etting &s;un, the gothic greane&s;s
of its fetures, and its mouldering walls of
dark grey &s;tone, rendered it a gloomy and
&s;ublime object. As &s;he gazed, the light
died away on its walls, leaving a melan|choly
purple tint, which &s;pread deeper and
deeper, as the thin vapour crept p the
mountain, wile the battlements above were
&s;till tipped with &s;plendour. From tho&s;e
too, the rays &s;oon faded, and the whole
edifice was inve&s;ted with he &s;olemn du&s;ki|ne&s;s
of evening. Silent, lonely and &s;ublime,
it &s;eemed to &s;tand the &s;overeign of the
&s;cene, and to frown defiance on all, who
<PB N="171" REF="173">
dared to invade its &s;olitary reig. As the
twilight deepened, its features became more
awful in ob&s;curity, and Emily continued to
gaze, till its clu&s;tering towers were alone
&s;een, ri&s;ing over the tops of the woods, be|neath
who&s;e thick &s;hade the carriages &s;oon
after began to a&s;cend.</P>
<P>The extent and darkrne&s;s of the&s;e tall
woods awakened terrific images in her
mind, and &s;he almo&s;t expected to &s;ee ban|ditti
&s;tart up from under the trees. At
length, the carriages emerged upon a heathy
rock, and, &s;oon after, reached the ca&s;tle
gates, where the deep tone of the portal
bell, which was &s;truck upon to give notice
of their arrival, increa &s;ed the fearful emo|tions,
that had a&s;&s;ailed Emily. While they
waited till the &s;ervant within &s;lould come
to open the gates, &s;he anxious&s;ly &s;urveyed the
edifice: but the gloom, that over&s;pread it,
allowed her to di&s;tingui&s;h little more than
a part of its outline, with the ma&s;&s;y walls
of the ramparts, and to know, that it
was va&s;, ancient and dreary. From the
<PB N="172" REF="174">
parts &s;he &s;aw, &s;he judged of the heavy
&s;trength and extent of the whole. The
gateway before her, leading into the courts,
was of gigantic &s;ize, nd was de&s;ended by
two round towers, crowned by overhang|ing
turrets, embattled, where, in&s;tead of
banners, now waved long gra&s;s and wild
plants, that had taken root among the
mouldering &s;tones, and which &s;eemed to
&s;igh, as the breeze rolled pa&s;t, over the de|&s;olation
around them. The towers were
united by a curtain, pierced and embattled
al&s;o, below which appeared the pointed
arch of an huge portcullis, &s;rmounting
the gates: from the&s;e, the walls of the
ramparts extended to other towers, over|looking
the precipice, who&s;e &s;hettered out|line,
appearing on a gleam, that lingered
in the we&s;t told of the ravages of war&mdash;
of evening.</P>
<P>While Emily gazed with awe upon the
&s;cence, foot&s;eps were heard within the gates,
and the undrawing of bolts; after which
<PB N="173" REF="175">
an ancient &s;ervant of the ca&s;tle appeared, for|cing
back he huge fold of the portal, to
admit his lord. As the carriage-wheels
rolled heavily under the portcullis, Emily's
heart &s;unk, and &s;he &s;eemed, as if &s;he was
going into her pri&s;on; the gloomy court,
into which &s;he pa&s;&s;ed, &s;erved to confirm the
idea, and her imagination, ever awake to
circum&s;tance, &s;uggefted even more terrors,
than her rea&s;on could juftify.</P>
<P>Another gate delivered them into the
&s;econd court, gra&s;s-grown, and more wild
than the fir&s;t, where, as &s;he &s;urveyed through
the twilight its de&s;olation-its lofty walls,
overtopt-with briony, mo&s;s and night|&s;hade,
and the embattled towers that ro&s;e
above,-long -&s;uffering and murder came
to her thoughts. One of tho&s;e in&s;tanta|neous
and unaccountable convictions, which
&s;ometimes conquer even &s;trong minds, im|pre&s;&s;ed
her with its horror. The &s;entiment
was not dimini&s;hed,when &s;he entered an
exten&s;ive gothic hall, ob&s;cured by the gloom
<PB N="174" REF="176">
of evening, which a light, glimmering at a
di&s;tance through a long per&s;pective of arches
only rendered more &s;triking. As a&s;ervant
brought the lamp nearer, partial gleams
fell upon the pillars and the pointed arches,
forming a &s;trong contra&s;t with their &s;ha|dows,
that &s;tretchd along the pavement
and the walls.</P>
<P>The &s;udden journey of Montony had
prevented his people from making any
other preparations for his reception, than
could be had in the &s;hort interval, &s;ince the
arrival of the &s;ervant, who had been &s;ent
forward from Venice; and this, in &s;ome
mea&s;ure, may account for the air of extreme
de&s;olation, that every where appeared.</P>
<P>The &s;ervent, who came to light Montoni,
bowed in &s;ilence, and the mu&s;cles of his coun|tenance
relaxed with no &s;ymptom of joy.&mdash;
Montoni noticed the &s;alutations by a &s;light
montion of his hand, and pa&s;&s;ed on, while
his lady, following, and looking round with
a degree of &s;urpri&s;e and di&s;content, which
<PB N="175" REF="177">
&s;he &s;eemed fearful of expre&s;&s;ing, and Emily,
&s;urveying the extent and grandeur of the
hall in timid wonder, approached a marble
&s;tair-ca&s;e. The arches here opened to a
lofty vault, from the center of which hung
a tripod lamp, which a &s;ervant was ha&s;tily
lighting; and the rich fret-work of the
roof, a corridor, leading into &s;everal upper
apartments, and a painted window, &s;tretch|ing
nearly from the pavement to the ceil|ing
of the hall, become gradually vi&s;ible.</P>
<P>Having cro&s;&s;ed the foot of the &s;tair-ca&s;e,
and pa&s;&s;ed through an anti-room, they en|tered
a &s;pacious apartment, who&s;e walls,
Wain&s;coted with black larch-wood, the
growth of the neighbouring mountains,
were &s;carcely di&s;tingui&s;hable from darkne&s;s
it&s;elt. &startq;Bring more light,&endq; &s;aid Montoni,
as he entered. The &s;ervant, &s;etting down
his lamp, was withdrawing to obey him,
when Madame Montoni ob&s;erving, that
the evening air of this mountainous re|gion
was cold, and that &s;he &s;hould like a
<PB N="176" REF="178">
fire, Montoni ordered that wood might
be brought.</P>
<P>While he paced the room with thoughtful
&s;teps, nd Madame Montoni &s;at &s;lently on
a couch, at the upper end of it, waiting
till the &s;ervant returned, Emily was ob|&s;erving
the &s;ngular &s;olemnity and de&s;ola|tion
of the apartment, viewed, as it now
was, by the glimmer of the &s;ingle lamp,
placed near a large Venetian mirror, that
du&s;kily reflected the &s;cene, with the tall
figure of Montoni pa&s;&s;ing &s;lowly along, his
arms folded, nd his countenance &s;haded
by the plume, that waved in his hat.</P>
<P>Form the contemplation of this &s;cene,
Emily's mind proceeded to the apprehen|&s;ion
of what &s;he might &s;uffer in it, till the
remembrance of valancourt, far, di&s;|tant!
came to her heart, and &s;oftened it
into &s;orrow. Aheavy &s;igh e&s;caped her:
but, trying to conceal her tears, &s;he walked
away to one of the high windows, that
opened upon the ramparts, below which,
<PB N="177" REF="179">
&s;pread the woods &s;he had pa&s;&s;ed in her ap|proach
to the ca&s;tle. But the night-&s;hade
&s;at deeply on the mountains beyond, and
their indented outline alone could be faintly
traced on the horizon, where a red &s;treak
yet glimmered in the we&s;t, The valley
between was &s;unk in darkne&s;s.</P>
<P>The &s;cene within, upon which Emily
turned on the opening of the door, was
&s;carcely le&s;s gloomy. The old &s;ervant.
who had received them at the gates, now
entered, bending under a load of pine|branches,
while two of Montoni,s Venetian
&s;ervants followed with lights.</P>
<P>&startq;Your Excellenza is welcome to the
c&s;tle,&endq; &s;aid the old man, as he rai&s;ed him|&s;elf
from the hearth, where he had laid the
wood: &startq;it has been a lonely place a long
while; but you will excu&s;e it, Signor,
knowing we had but &s;hort notice. It is
near two years, come next fea&s;t of St. Mark,
&s;ince your Excellenza was within the&s;e walls.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;You have a good memory, old Carlo,&endq;
<PB N="178" REF="180">
&s;aid Montoni: &startq;it is thereabout; and how
ha&s;t thou contrived to live &s;o long?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;A-well-a-day, &s;ir, with much ado;
the cold winds, that blow through the ca&s;tle
in winter, are almo&s;t too much for me; and
I thought &s;ometimes of a&s;king your Excel|lenza
to let me leave he mountains, and go
down into the lowlands. But I don't know
how it is&mdash;I am loth to quit the&s;e old walls
I have lived in &s;o long.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Well, how have you gone on in the
ca&s;tle, &s;ince I left it?&endq;&s;aid Montoni.</P>
<P>&startq;Why much as u&s;ual, Signor, only it
want a good deal of repairing. There is
the north tower-&s;ome of the battlements
have tumbled down, and had liked one
day to have knocked my poor wife (God
re&s;t her &s;oul!) on the head. Your Excellenza
mu&s;t know&endq;&mdash;</P>
<P>&startq;Well, but the repairs,&endq; interrupted
Montoni.</P>
<P>&startq;Aye, the repairs,&endq; &s;aid carlo:&startq;a part
of the roof of the great hall has fallen in,
<PB N="179" REF="181">
and all the winds from the mountains ru&s;hed
through it la&s;t winter, and whi&s;tled through
the whole ca&s;tle &s;o, that there was no
keeping one's &s;elf warm, be where one
would. There, my wife and I u&s;ed to &s;it
&s;hvering over a great fire in one corner
of the little hall, ready to die with cold,
and&endq;&mdash;</P>
<P>&startq;But there are no more repairs wanted,&endq;
&s;aid Montoni, impatiently.</P>
<P>&startq;o Lord! your Excellenza, yes-the wall
of the rampart has tumbled down in three
places; then, the &s;tairs, that lead to the
west gallery, have been a long time &s;o bad,
that it is dangerous to go up them; and the
pa&s;&s;age leading to the great oak chamber,
that overhangs the north rampart&mdash;one
night la&s;t winter I ventured to go there by
my&s;elf, and your Excellenza&endq;&mdash;</P>
<P>&startq;Well, well, enough of this,&endq; &s;aid Mon|toni,
with quickne&s;s: &startq;I will talk more
with thee to-morrow.&endq;</P>
<P>The fire was now lighted; Carlo &s;wept
the hearth, placed chairs, wiped the du&s;t
<PB N="180" REF="182">
from a large marble table that &s;tood near
it, and then left the room.</P>
<P>Montoni and his family drew round the
fire. Madame Montoni made &s;everal at|tempts
at conver&s;ation, but his &s;ullen an|&s;wers
repul&s;ed her, while Emily &s;at endea|vouring
to acquire courage enough to &s;peak
to him. At length, in a tremulous voice,
the &s;aid, &startq;May I a&s;k, &s;ir, the motive of
this &s;udden journey?&endq;&mdash;After a long pau&s;e,
the recovered &s;ufficient courage to repeat
the que&s;tion.</P>
<P>&startq;It does not &s;uit me to an&s;wer enqui|ries,&endq;
&s;aid Montoni, &startq;nor does it become
you to make them; time may unfold them
all: but I de&s;ire I may be no further ha|ra&s;&s;ed,
and I recommend it to you to re|tire
to your chamber, and to endeavour to
adopt a more rational conduct, than that of
yielding to fancies, and to a &s;en&s;ibility,
which, to call it by:the gentle&s;t name, is
only a weakne&s;s.&endq;</P>
<P>Emily ro&s;e to withdraw. &startq;Good night,
madam,&endq; &s;aid &s;he to her aunt, with an
<PB N="181" REF="183">
a&s;&s;umed compo&s;ure, that could not di&s;gui&s;e
her emotion.</P>
<P>&startq;Good night, my dear,&endq; &s;aid Madame
Montoni, in a tone of kindne&s;s, which her
niece had never before heard from her; and
the unexpected endearment brought tears
to Emily's eyes. She curt&s;ied to Montoni,
and was retiring; &startq;But you do not know
the way to your chamber,&endq; &s;aid her aunt.
Montoni called the servant, who waited
in the anti-room, and bade him &s;end Ma|dame
Montoni's woman, with whom, in
a few minutes, Emily withdrew.</P>
<P>&startq;Do you know which is my room?&endq;
&s;aid &s;he to Annette, as they cro&s;&s;ed the
hall.</P>
<P>&startq;Yes, I believe I do, ma'am&s;elle; but
this is &s;uch a &s;trange rambling place! I have
been lo&s;t in it already: they call it the
double chamber, over the &s;outh rampart,
and I went up this great &s;tair ca&s;e to it.
My lady's room is at the other end of the
castle.&endq;</P>
<P>Emily a&s;cended the marble flair-cafe,
<PB N="182" REF="184">
and came to the corridor, as they pa&s;&s;ed
through which, Annette re&s;umed her chat&mdash;
&startq;What a wild lonely place this is, ma'am!
I shall be quite frightened to live in it.
How often, and often I have wi&s;hed my|&s;elf
in France again! I little thought, when
I came with my lady to &s;ee the world, that
I &s;hould ever be &s;hut up in &s;uch a place as
this, or I would never have left my own
country! This way, ma'am&s;elle down this
turning. I can almo&s;t believe in giants
again, and &s;uch like, for this is ju&s;t like
one of their ca&s;tles; and, &s;ome night or
other; I &s;uppo&s;e I &s;hall &s;ee fairies too, hop|ping
about in that great old hall, that looks
more like a church, with its huge pillars,
than any thing el&s;e.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Yes,&endq; &s;aid Emily, &s;miling, and glad
to e&s;cape from, more &s;erious thought, &startq;if
we come to the corridor, about midnight,
and look down into the hall, we shall cer|tainly
&s;ee it illuminated with a thou&s;and
lamps, and the fairies tripping in gay circles
to the found of delicious mu&s;ic; for it is in
<PB N="183" REF="185">
&s;uch places as this, you know, that they
come to hold their revels. But I am afraid,
Annette, you will not be able to pay the
nece&s;&s;ary penance for &s;uch a &s;ight: and, if
once they hear your voice, the whole &s;cene
will vani&s;h in an in&s;tant.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;o! if you will bear me company,
me'am&s;elle, I will come to the corridor,
this very night, and I promi&s;e you I will
hold my tongue; it &s;hall not be my fault
if the &s;how vani&s;hes.&mdash;But do you think
they will come?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I cannot promise that with certainty,
but I will venture to &s;ay, it will not be your
fault if the enchantment &s;hould vani&s;h.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Well, ma'am&s;elle, that is &s;aying more
than I expected of you: but I am not &s;o
much afraid of fairies, as of gho&s;ts, and they
&s;ay there are a plentiful many of them
about the ca&s;tle: now I &s;hould be frightened
to death, if I &s;hould chance to &s;ee any of
them. But hu&s;h! ma'am&s;elle, that is walk &s;oftly!
I have thought, &s;everal times &s;omething
pa&s;&s;ed by me.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="184" REF="186">
&startq;Ridiculous!&endq; &s;aid Emily,&startq;you must
not indulge such fancies.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;o ma'am I they are not fancies, for
aught I know; Benedetto &s;ays the&s;e di&s;mal
galleries and halls are &s;ir for nothing but
gho&s;ts to live in; and I verily believe, if I
Iive long in them I &s;hall turn to one my|&s;elf!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I hope,&endq; &s;aid Emily, &startq;you will not
&s;uffer Signor Montoni to hear of the&s;e
weak fears; they would highly di&s;plea&s;e
him.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;What, you know then, ma'am&s;elle, all
about it!&endq;rejoined Annette. &startq;No, no,
I do know better than to do &s;o though,
if the Signor can &s;leep found, nobody el&s;e
in the ca&s;tle has any right to lie awake, I
am &s;ure.&endq;Emily did not appear to notice
this remark.</P>
<P>&startq;Down this pa&s;&s;age, ma'am&s;elle; this
leads to a back &s;tair-cafe. O! if I &s;ee any
thing, I &s;hall be frightened out of my wits!</P>
<P>&startq;That will &s;carcely be po&s;&s;ible,&endq; &s;aid
Emily, &s;miling, as &s;he followed the wind|ing
<PB N="185" REF="187">
of the pa&s;&s;age, which opened into ano|ther
gallery: and then Annette, perceiving
that &s;he had mi&s;&s;ed her way, while &s;he had
been &s;o eloquently haranguing on ghosts
and fairies, wandered about through other
pa&s;&s;ages and galleries, till, at length, fright|ened
by their intricacies, and de&s;olation,
&s;he called aloud for a&s;&s;i&s;tance; but they were
beyond the hearing. of the &s;ervants, who
were on the other &s;ide of the ca&s;tle, and
Emily now opened the door of a chamber
on die left.</P>
<P>&startq;O! do not go in there, ma'am&s;elle,&endq;
&s;aid Annette, &startq;you will only lo&s;e your&s;elf
further.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Bring the light forward,&endq; &s;aid Emily,
&startq;we may po&s;&s;ibly find our way through
the&s;e rooms.&endq;</P>
<P>Annette &s;tood at the door, in an at|titude
of he&s;itation, with the light held
up to &s;hew the chamber, but the &s;eeble
rays &s;pread through not half of it. &startq;Why
do you he&s;itate?&endq;&s;aid Emily,&startq;let me &s;ee
whither this room leads.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="186" REF="188">
Annette advanced reluctantly. It opened
into a &s;uite of &s;pacious and ancient apart|ments,
&s;ome of which were hung with ta|pe&s;try,
and others wain&s;coted with cedar
and black larch-wood. What furniture
there was, &s;eemed to be altmo&s;t as old as the
rooms, and retained an appearance of gran|deur,
though covered with dust, and drop|ping
to pieces with the damps, and with
age.</P>
<P>&startq;How cold the&s;e rooms are, ma'am&s;elle!&endq;
&s;aid Annette:&startq;nobody has lived in them
for many, many years, they &s;ay. Do let
us go.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;They may open upon the great &s;tair|cafe,
perhaps,&endq; &s;aid Emily, pa&s;&s;ing on till
&s;he came to a chamber, hung with pictures,
and took the light to examine that of a
&s;oldier on hor&s;eback in a field of battle.&mdash;
He was darting his &s;pear upon a man, who
lay under the feet of the hor&s;e, and who
held up one hand in a &s;upplicating attitude.
The &s;oldier, who&s;e beaver was up, regard|ed
him with a look of vengeance, and
<PB N="187" REF="189">
the countenance, with that expre&s;&s;ion,
&s;truck Emily as re&s;embling Montoni. She
&s;huddered, and turned from it. Pa&s;&s;ing
the light ha&s;tily over &s;everal other pictures,
&s;he came to one concealed by a veil of
black &s;ilk. The &s;ingularity of die circum|&s;tance
&s;truck her, and &s;he &s;topped before
it, wi&s;hing to remove the veil, and examine
what could thus carefully be concealed, but
&s;omewhat wanting courage. &startq;Holy Vir|gin!
what can this mean?&endq;exclaimed
Annette. &startq;This is &s;urely the picture they
told me of at Venice.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;What picture? &s;aid Emily.&endq; Why
a picture&mdash;a picture,&startq;replied Annette, he|&s;itatingly
&mdash;&startq;but I never could make out
exactly what it was about, either.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Remove the veil, Annette.&endq;</P>
<P>What! I ma'am&s;elle!&mdash;I! not for the
world!&startq;Emily, turning round, &s;aw An|nette's
countenance grow pale.&endq; And
pray, what have you heard of this picture,
to terrify you &s;o, my good girl?&endq;&s;aid &s;he
<PB N="188" REF="190">
&startq;Nothing, ma'am&s;elle: I have heard no|thing,
only let us find our way out.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Certainly: but I with fir&s;t to examine
the picture; take the light, Annette, while
I lift the veil.&endq; Annette took the light,
and immediately walked away with it, dif|regarding
Emily's calls to &s;tay, who, not
choo&s;ing to be left alone in the dark cham|ber,
at length followed her. &startq;What is the
rea&s;on of this, Annette?&endq;&s;aid Emily, when
&s;he overtook her, &startq;what have you heard
concerning that picture, which makes you
&s;o unwilling to &s;tay when I bid you?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I don't know what is the rea&s;on,
ma'am&s;elle, replied Annette,&endq;nor any
thing about the picture, only I have heard
there is &s;omething very dreadful belonging
to it&mdash;and that it has been covered up in
black ever &s;ince&mdash;and that nobody has looked
at it for a great many years&mdash;and it some|how
has to do with the owner of this ca&s;tle
before Signor Montoni came to the po&s;&s;ef|&s;ion
of it&mdash;and&endq;&mdash;</P>
<P>&startq;Well, Annette,&endq; &s;aid Emily, &s;miling,
<PB N="189" REF="191">
&startq;I perceive it is as you &s;ay&mdash;that you
know nothing about the picture.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;No, nothing, indeed, ma'am&s;elle, for
they made me promi&s;e never to tell;
but&endq;&mdash;</P>
<P>&startq;Well,&endq; rejoined Emily, who ob&s;erved
that &s;he was &s;truggling between her inclina|tion
to reveal a &s;ecret, and her apprehen&s;ion
for the con&s;equence,&endq; I will enquire no
further&endq;&mdash;</P>
<P>&startq;No' pray, ma'am, do not.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Left you &s;hould tell all,&endq; interrupted
Emily.</P>
<P>Annette blu&s;hed, and Emily &s;miled, and
they pa&s;&s;ed on to the extremity of this
&s;uite of apartments, and found them&s;elves,
after &s;ome farther perplexity, once more
at the top of the marble &s;tair-ca&s;e, where
Annette left Emily, while &s;he went to call
one of the &s;ervants of the ca&s;tle to &s;hew
them to the chamber, for which they had
been &s;eeking.</P>
<P>While &s;he was ab&s;ent, Emily's thoughts,
returned to the picture; an unwillingne&s;s
<PB N="190" REF="192">
to tamper with the integrity of a &s;ervant,
had checked her enquiries on this &s;ubject,
as well as concerning &s;ome alarming hints,
which Annette had dropped re&s;pecting
Montoni; though her curio&s;ity was entirely
awakened, and &s;he had perceived, that her
que&s;tions might ea&s;ily be an&s;wered. She
was now, however, inclined to go back to
the apartment and examine the picture;
but the loneline&s;s of the hour and of the
place, with the melancholy &s;ilence that
reigned around her, con&s;pired with a cer|tain
degree of awe, excited by the my&s;tery
attending this picture, to prevent her. She
determined, however, when day-light &s;hould
have re-animated her &s;pirits, to go thither
and remove the veil. As &s;he leaned from
the corridor, over the &s;tair-ca&s;e, and her
eyes wandered round, &s;he again ob&s;erved,
with wonder, the va&s;t &s;trength of the walls,
now &s;omewhat decayed, and the pillars of
&s;olid marble, that ro&s;e from the hall, and
&s;upported the roof.</P>
<P>A &s;ervant now appeared with Annette,
<PB N="191" REF="193">
and conducted. Emily to her chamber,
which was in a remote part of the ca&s;tle,
and at the end of the very corridor, from
whence the &s;uite of apartments open|ed,
through which, they had been wan|dering.
The lonely a&s;pect of her room
made Emily unwilling that Annette &s;hould
leave her immediately, and the dampne&s;s
of it chilled her with more than fear. She
begged Caterina, the &s;ervant of the ca&s;tle,
to bring &s;ome wood and light a fire.</P>
<P>&startq;Aye, lady, it's many a year &s;ince a fire
was lighted here,&endq; &s;aid Caterina.</P>
<P>&startq;You need not tell us that, good wo|man,&endq;
&s;aid Annette; &startq;every room in the
ca&s;tle feels, like a well. I wonder how you
contrive to live here; for my part, I wi&s;h
my&s;elf at Venice again.&endq; Emily waved her
hand for Caterina to fetch the wood.</P>
<P>&startq;I wonder, ma'am, why they call this
the double chamber?&endq;&s;aid Annette, while
Emily &s;urveyed it in &s;ilence and &s;aw that
it was lo&s;ty and &s;pacious, like the others
&s;he had &s;een, and, like many of them, too,
<PB N="192" REF="194">
had its walls lined with dark larch-wood.
The bed and other furniture was very an|cient,
and had an air of gloomy grandeur,
like all that &s;he had &s;een in the ca&s;tle. one
of the high ca&s;ements, which &s;he opened,
overlooked a rampart, but the view beyond
was hid in darkne&s;s.</P>
<P>In the pre&s;ence of Annette, Emily tried
to &s;upport her &s;pirits, and to re&s;train the
tears, which, every now and then, came to
her eyes. She wi&s;hed much to enquirer
when Count Morano was expected at the
ca&s;tle, but an unwillingne&s;s to a&s;k unne|ce&s;&s;ary
que&s;tions, and to mention family
concerns to a &s;ervant, withheld her. Mean|while,
Annette's thoughts were engaged
upon another &s;ubject: &s;he dearly loved the
marvellous, and had heard of a circum|&s;tance,
connected with the ca&s;tle, that
highly gratified this, ta&s;te. Having been
enjoined not to mention it, her inclination
to tell it was &s;o &s;trong, that &s;he was every
in&s;tant on the point of &s;peaking what &s;he
had heard. Such a &s;trange circum&s;tance,
<PB N="193" REF="195">
too, and to be obliged to conceal It, was a
&s;evere puni&s;hment; but &s;he knew, that
Montoni might impo&s;e one much &s;everer,
and &s;he feared to incur it by offending
him.</P>
<P>Caterina now brought the wood, and its
bright blaze di&s;pellod, for a while, the
gloom of the chamber. She told Annette,
that her lady had enquired for her, and
Emily was once again left to her own &s;ad
reflections. Her heart was not yet hardened
again&s;t the &s;tern manners of Montoni,
and &s;he was nearly as much &s;hocked now,
as &s;he had been when &s;he fir&s;t witne&s;&s;ed
them. The tenderne&s;s and affection, to
which &s;he had been accu&s;tomed, till &s;he
lo&s;t her patents, had made her particularly
&s;en&s;ible to any degree of unkindne&s;s, and
&s;uch a rever&s;e as this no apprehen&s;ion had
prepared her to &s;upport.</P>
<P>To call off her attention from &s;ubjects,
that pre&s;&s;ed heavily upon her &s;pirits, &s;he
ro&s;e and again examined her room and its
furniture. As &s;he walked round it, &s;he
<PB N="194" REF="196">
pa&s;&s;ed a door, that was not quite &s;hut, and,
perceiving, that it was not the one, through
which &s;he entered, &s;he brought the light
forward to di&s;cover whither it led. She
opened it, and, going forward, had nearly
fallen down a &s;teep, narrow &s;tair-ca&s;e, that
wound from it, between two &s;tone walls.
She wi&s;hed to know to what it led, and was
the more anxious, &s;ince it communicated &s;o
immediately with her apartment; but, in
the pre&s;ent &s;tate of her &s;piritns, &s;he wanted
courage to venture into the darkne&s;s alone.
Clo&s;ing the door, therefore, &s;he endeavoured
to fa&s;ten it, but, upon further examination,
perceived, that it had no bolts on the cham|ber
&s;ide, though it had two on the other.
By placing a heavy chair again&s;t it, &s;he
in &s;ome mea&s;ure remedied the defect; yet
&s;he was &s;till alarmed at the thought of
&s;leeping in this remote room alone, with
a door opening &s;he knew not whither, and
which could not be perfectly fa&s;tened on the
in&s;ide. Sometimes &s;he wi&s;hed to entreat of
Madame Montoni, that Annette might have
<PB N="195" REF="197">
leave to remain with her all night, but was
deterred by an apprehen&s;ion of betraying
what would be thought childi&s;h fears, and
by an unwillingne&s;s to increa&s;e the apt ter|rors
of Annette.</P>
<P>Her gloomy reflections were, &s;oon after,
interrupted by a foot&s;tep in the corridor, and
&s;he was glad to &s;ee Annette enter with &s;ome
&s;upper, &s;ent by Madame Montoni. Hav|ing
a table near the fire, &s;he made the good
girl &s;it down and &s;up with her; and, when
their little repa&s;t was over, Annette, encou|raged
by her kindne&s;s and &s;tirring the wood
into a blaze, drew her chair upon the hearth,
nearer to Emily, and &s;aid,-&startq;Did you ever
hear, ma'am&s;elle of the &s;trange accident,
that made the Signor lord of this ca&s;tle?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;What wonderful &s;tory have you now
to tell?&endq; &s;aid Emily, concealing the curio|&s;ity,
occa&s;ioned by the my&s;trerious hints &s;he
had formerly heard on that &s;ubject.</P>
<P>&startq;I have heard all about it, ma'am&s;elle,&endq;
&s;aid Annette, looking round the chamber
and drawing clo&s;er to Emily; &startq;Benedetto
<PB N="196" REF="198">
told it me as we travelled togetiier: &s;ays he,
Annette, you don't know about this ca&s;tle
here, that we are going to? No, &s;ays I,
Mr. Benedetto, pray what do you know?
But, ma'am&s;elle, you can keep a &s;ecret, or
I would not tell it you for the world; for
I promi&s;ed never to tell, and they &s;ay,
that the Signor does not like to have it
talked of.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;If you promi&s;ed to keep this &s;eeret,&endq;
&s;aid Emily, &startq;you do right not to men|tion
it.&endq;</P>
<P>Annette pau&s;ed a moment, and then
&s;aid, &startq;O, but to you, ma'am&s;elle, to you
I may tell it &s;afely, I know.&endq;</P>
<P>Emily &s;miled, &startq;I certainly &s;hall keep it
as faithfully as your&s;elf, Annette.&endq;</P>
<P>Annette replied very gravely, that would
do, and proceeded&mdash;&startq;This ca&s;tle, you mu&s;t
know, ma'am&s;elle, is very old, and very
&s;trong, and has &s;tood out many &s;ieges, as
they &s;ay. Now it was not Signor Montoni's
always, nor his father's; no; but, by &s;ome
<PB N="197" REF="199">
law or other, it was to come to the Signor,
if the lady died unmarried.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;What lady?&endq; &s;aid Emily.</P>
<P>&startq;I am not come to that yet,&endq; replied
Annette, &startq;it is the lady I am going to
tell you about, ma'am&s;elle; but, as I was
&s;aying, this lady lived in the ca&s;tle, and
had every thing very grand about her, as
you may &s;uppo&s;e, ma'am&s;elle. The Signor
u&s;ed often to come to &s;ee her, and was in
love with her, and offered to marry her;
for, though he was &s;omehow related, that did
not &s;ignify. But &s;he was in love with &s;ome|body
el&s;e, and would not have him, which
made him, very angry, as they &s;ay, and
you know, ma'am&s;elle, what an ill-looking
gentleman he is, when he is angry. Perhaps
&s;he &s;aw him in a pa&s;&s;ion, and therefore
would not have him. But, as I was &s;aying,
&s;he was very melancholy and unhappy,
and all that, for a long while, and&mdash;Holy
Virgin! what noi&s;e is that? did not you
hear a &s;ound, ma'am&s;elle?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;It was only the wind,&endq; &s;aid Emily,
<PB N="198" REF="200">
&startq;but do come to the end of your
&s;tory.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;As I was &s;aying&mdash;O, where was I?&mdash;
as I was &s;aying&mdash;&s;he was very melancholy
and unhappy a long while, and u&s;ed to
walk about upon the terrace, there, under
the windows, by her&s;elf, and cry &s;o! It
would have done your heart good to hear her.
That is&mdash;I don't mean good, but it would
have made you cry too, as they tell me,&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Well, but, Annette, do tell me the
&s;ub&s;tance of your tale.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;All in good time, ma'am; all this I
heard before at Venice, but what is to
come I never heard till to-day. This hap|pened
a great many years ago, when Signor
Montoni was quite a young man. The
lady-they called her Signora Laurentini,
was very hand&s;ome, but &s;he u&s;ed to be in
great pa&s;&s;ions, too, &s;ometimes, as well as the
Signor. Finding he could not make her
li&s;ten to him&mdash;what, does he do, but leave
the ca&s;tle, and never comes near it for a
long; time! but it was all one to her; &s;he
<PB N="199" REF="201">
was just as unhappy whe ther he was here
or not, till one evening, Holy St. Peter!
ma'am&s;elle,&startq;cried Annette,&startq;look at that
lamp, &s;ee how blue it burns!&endq; she looked
fearfully round the chamber.&startq;Ridicu|lous
girl!&endq; &s;aid Emily,&startq;why will you
indulge tho&s;e fancies? Pray let me hear the
end of your &s;tory, I am weary.&endq;</P>
<P>Annette &s;till kept her eyes on the lamp,
and proceeded in a lower voice.&startq;It
was one evening, they &s;ay, at the latter
end of the year, it might be about the
middle of september, I suppo&s;e, or the be|ginning
of October: nay, for that matter,
it might be November, for that, too, is the
latter end of the year, but that I connot
&s;ay for certain, becau&s;e they did not tell me
for certain them&s;elves. However, it was at
the latter end of the year, this grand lady
walked out of the ca&s;tle into the woods
below, as &s;he had often done before, all
alone, only her maid was with her. the
wind blew cold, and &s;trewed the leaves
about, and whi&s;tled di&s;mally among tho&s;e
<PB N="200" REF="202">
great old che&s;nut trees, that we pa&s;&s;ed,
ma'am&s;elle, as we came to the ca&s;tle&mdash;for
Benedetto &s;hewed me the trees as he was
talking&mdash;the wind blew cold, and her wo|man
would have per&s;uaded her to return:
but all would not do, for &s;he was fond of
walking in the woods, at evening time,
and, if the leaves were falling about her, &s;o
much the better.</P>
<P>&startq;Well, they &s;aw her go down among
the woods, but night came, and &s;he did not
return; ten o'clock, eleven o'clock, twelve
o'clock came, and not lady! Well, the &s;er|vants
thought to be &s;ure, &s;ome accident had
befallen her, and they went out to &s;eek
her. they &s;earched all night long, but
could not find her, or any trace of her;
and, from that day to this, ma'am&s;elle, &s;he
has never been heard of.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Is this true, Annette?&endq; &s;aid Emily, in
much &s;urpri&s;e.</P>
<P>&startq;True, ma'am!&endq; &s;aid Annette, with a
look of horror,&startq;yes, it is true, indeed.
But they do &s;ay,&endq; &s;he added, lowering her
<PB N="201" REF="203">
voice, &startq;they do &s;ay, that the signora has
been &s;een, &s;everal times &s;ince, walking in
the woods and about the ca&s;tle in the night:
&s;everal of the old &s;ervants, who remained
here &s;ome time after, deeclare they &s;aw her;
and, &s;ince then, &s;he has been &s;een by &s;ome
of the va&s;&s;als, who have happened to be in
the ca&s;tle, at night. Carlo, the old &s;teward,
could tell &s;uch things, they &s;ay, if he
would.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;How contradictory is this, Annette!&endq;
&s;aid Emily,&startq;you &s;ay nothing has been
&s;ince known of her, and yet &s;he has been
&s;een!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;But all this was told me for a great &s;e|cret&endq; rejoined Annette, without noticing
the remark,,&startq;and I am &s;ure, ma'am, you
would not hurt ei ther me or Benedetto, &s;o
much as to go and tell it again&endq; Emily
remained &s;ilent, and Annette repeated her
la&s;t &s;entence</P>
<P>&startq;You have nothing to fear from my
indi&s;cretion,&endq; replied Emily,&startq;and let me
advi&s;e you, my good Annette, be di&s;creet
<PB N="202" REF="204">
your&s;elf, and never mention what you have
j&s;ust told me to any o ther per&s;on. Signor
Montoni, as you &s;ay, may be angry if he
hears of it. But what enquiries were made
concerning the lady?</P>
<P>&startq;O! a great dea!, indeed, ma'am&s;elle,
for the Signor laid claim to the ca&s;tle di|rectly,
as being the next heir, and they
&s;aid, that is the judges, or the &s;enators, or
&s;omebody of that &s;ort, &s;aid, he could not
take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it till &s;o many years were
gone by, and then, if, after all, the lady
could not be found, why &s;he would be as
good as dead, and the ca&s;tle would be his
own; and &s;o it is his own. But the &s;tory
went round, and many &s;trange reports were
&s;pread, &s;o very &s;trange, ma'am&s;elle, that
I &s;hall not tell them.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;That is &s;tranger &s;till, Annette,&endq; &s;aid
Emily, &s;miling, and rou&s;ing her&s;elf from
her reverie.&startq;But, when Signora Lauren|tini
was afterwards &s;een in the ca&s;tle, did
nobody &s;peak to her?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;speak&mdash;&s;peak to her!&endq; cried An|nette,
<PB N="203" REF="205">
with a look of terror;&startq;on, to be
&s;ure.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;And why not?&endq; rejoined Emily, will|ing
to hear further.</P>
<P>&startq;Holy Mo ther! &s;peak to a &s;pirit!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;But what rea&s;on had they to conclude
it was a &s;pirit, unle&s;s they had approached,
and &s;poken to it?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;O ma'am&s;elle, I cannot tell. How
can you a&s;k &s;uch &s;hocking que&s;tions? But
nobody ever &s;aw it come in, or go out of
the ca&s;tle; and it was in one place now,
and then the next minute in quite ano ther
part of the ca&s;tle; and then it never &s;poke,
and, if it was alive, what &s;hould it do in
the ca&s;tle if it never &s;poke? Several parts
of the ca&s;tle have never been gone into &s;ince,
they &s;ay, for that very rea&s;on.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;What, becau&s;e it never &s;poke?&endq; &s;aid
Emily, trying to lough away the fears, that
began to &s;teal upon her&mdash;&startq;No, ma'am|&s;elle, no;&endq; replied Annette, ra ther angrily,
&startq;but becau&s;e &s;omething has been &s;een
there they &s;ay, too, there is an old cha|pel
<PB N="204" REF="206">
adjoining the we&s;t &s;ide of the ca&s;tle,
where, any time at midnight, you may hear
&s;uch groans!&mdash;it makes one &s;hudder to
think of them!&mdash;and &s;trange &s;ights have
been &s;een there&mdash;&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Pr'y thee, Annette, no more of the&s;e
&s;illy tales,&endq; &s;aid Emily.</P>
<P>&startq;&s;illy tales, ma'am&s;elle! O, but I will
tell you one &s;tory about this, if you plea&s;
that Caterina told me. It was one cold
winter's night that Caterina (&s;he often came
to the ca&s;tle then, &s;he &s;ays, to keep old
Carlo and his wife company, and &s;o he
recommended her afterwards to the Signor,
and &s;he lived here ever &s;ince) Caterina
was &s;itting with them in the little hall, &s;ays
Carlo, 'I wi&s;h we had &s;ome of tho&s;e figs
to roa&s;t, that lie in the &s;tore-clo&s;et, but it
is a long way off, and I am loth to fetch
them; do, Caterina, ' &s;ays he, 'for you are
young and nimble, do bring us &s;ome
the fire is in a nice trim for roa&s;ting them;
they lie, ' &s;ays he, ' in &s;uch a corner of the
&s;tore-room, at the end of the noth-gallery;
<PB N="205" REF="207">
here, take the lamp, ' &s;ays he, ' and mind,
as you go up the great &s;tair-café, that the
wind, through the roof, does not blow it
out.' So, with that, Caterina took the
lamp&mdash;Hu&s;h! ma'am&s;elle, I &s;urely heard
a noi&s;e!"</P>
<P>Emily, whom Annette had now infected
with her own terrors, liftened attentively;
but every thing was &s;till, and Annette pro|ceeded:</P>
<P>&startq;Caterina went to the north-gallery, that
is the wide gallery we pa&s;&s;ed, ma'am, before
we came to the corridor, here. As &s;he
went with the lamp in her hand, thinking
of nothing at all&mdash;there, again!&endq; cried
Annertte, &s;uddenly&mdash;&startq;I heard it again!&mdash;
it was not fancy, ma'am&s;elle!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Hu&s;h!&endq; &s;aid Emily, trembling. they
li&s;tened, and, continuing to fit quite &s;till,
Emily heard a low knocking again&s;t the
Wall. It came repeatedly. Annette then
&s;creamed loudly, and the chamber door
&s;lowly opened.&mdash;It was Caterina, come to
<PB N="206" REF="208">
tell Annette, that her lady wanted her.
Emily, though &s;he now perceived who it
was, could not immediately overcome her
terror; while Annette, half laughing, half
crying, &s;colded Caterina heartily for thus
alarming them; and was al&s;o terrified left
what &s;he had told had been overheard.&mdash;
Emily, who&s;e mind was deeply impre&s;&s;ed
by the chief circum&s;tance of Annette's rela|tion,
was unwilling to be left alone, in the
pre&s;ent &s;tate of her &s;pirits; but, to avoid
offending Madame Mantoni, and betray|ing
her own weakne&s;s, &s;he &s;truggled to
overcome the illu&s;ions of fear, and di&s;|mi&s;&s;ed
Annette for the night.</P>
<P>When &s;he was alone, her thoughts re|curred
to the &s;trange history of Signora Lau|rentini
and then to her own &s;trange &s;itua|tion,
in the wild and &s;olitary mountains of
a foreign country, in the ca&s;tle, and the
power of a man, to whom, only a few pre|ceding
months, &s;he was an entire &s;tranger;
who had already exerci&s;ed an u&s;urped au|thority
<PB N="207" REF="209">
over her, and who&s;e character &s;he
now regarded, with a degree of terror, appa|rently
ju&s;tified by the fears of o thers. &s;he
knew, that he had invention equal to the
conception and talents to the execution
of any project, and &s;he greatly feared he
had a heart too void of feeling to op|po&s;e
the perpetration of whatever his in|tere&s;t
might &s;ugge&s;t. &s;he had long ob|&s;erved
the unhappine&s; &s; of Madame Mon|toni,
and had often been witne&s; &s; to the
&s;tern and contemptuou&s; behaviour &s;he re|ceived
from her husband. To the&s;e cir|cum&s;tances,
which con&s;pired to give her
ju&s;t cau&s;e for alarm, were now added tho&s;e
thou&s;and namele&s;s terrors, which exi&s;t only
in active imaginations, and which &s;et rea&s;on
and examination equally at defiance.</P>
<P>Emily remembered all that Vlancourt
had told her, on the eve of her departure
from languedoc, re&s;pecting Montoni,
and all that he had &s;aid to di&s; &s;uade her
from venturing on the journey. His fears
had often &s;ince appeared to her prophetic
<PB N="208" REF="210">
now they &s;eemed confirmed. Hyer heart,
as it gave her back the image of Valancourt,
mourned in vain regret, but re&s;on &s;oon
came with a con&s;olation, which, though
feeble at &s;ir&s;t, acquired vigour from reflec|tion.
&s;he con&s;idered, that, whatever might
be her &s;ufferings, &s;he had withheld from in|volving
him in misfortune, and that what|ever
her future &s;orrows could be, &s;he was, at
lea&s;t, free from &s;elf-reproach.</P>
<P>Her melancholy was a&s; &s;i&s;ted by the hol|low
fighings of the wind along along the corridor
And round the ca&s;tle. the cheerful blaze
of the wood had long been exitingui&s;hed,
and &s;he fat with her eyes fixed on the dying
embers, till a loud gu&s;t, that &s;wept through
the corridor, and &s;hook the doors and ca&s;e|ments,
alarmed her, for its violence had
moved the chair &s;he had placed as a &s;fa&s;ten
ing, and the door, leading to the private
&s;tair-café, &s;tood half open. Her curio&s;ity
and her fears were again awakened. &s;he
took the lamp to the top of the &s; &s;teps, and
&s;tood he&s;itating ehe ther to go down; but
<PB N="209" REF="211">
again the profound &s;tillne&s;s and the gloom
of the place awed her, and, determining to
enquire fur ther, when day-light might a&s;&s;i&s;t
the &s;earch, &s;he clo&s;ed the door, and placed
again&s;t it a &s;toanger guard.</P>
<P>She now retired to her bed, leaving the
lamp burning on the table; but its gloomy
light, in&s;tead of di&s;pelling her fear, a&s;&s;i&s;ted
it; for, by its uncertain rays, &s;he almost
fancied &s;he &s;aw &s;hapes &s;lit pas&s;t her curtains
and glide into the remote ob&s;curity of her
chamber.&mdash;the ca&s;tle clock &s;truck one be|fore
&s;he clo&s;ed her eyes to &s;leep.</P>

<P>DAYLIGHT di&s;pelled from Emily's
midn the glooms of &s;uper&s;tition, but not
tho&s;e of apprehen&s;ion. the Count Morano
was the fir&s;t image, that occured to her
waking thoughts, and then came a train of
anticipated evils, which &s;he could nei ther
ocnquer, or avoid. She ro&s;e, and to re|lieve
her mind from the bu&s;y ideas, that tor|mented
it, compelled her&s;elf to notice ex|ternal
objects. From her ca&s;ement &s;he
looked out upon the wild grandeur of the
&s;cene, clo&s;ed nearly on all &s;ids by alpine &s;teeps, who&s;e tops, peeping over each o ther,
faded from the eye in mifty hues, while the
<PB N="211" REF="213">
promontories below were dark with woods,
that &s;wept down to their ba&s;e, and &s;tretched
along the narrow vallies. the rich pomp
of the&s;e woods was particularly delightful
to Emily; and &s;he viewed with a&s;toni&s;h|ment
the fortifications of the ca&s;tle &s;pread|ing
along a va&s;t extent of rock, and now
partly in decay, the grandeur of the ram
parts below, and the towers and battlements
and various features of the fabric above.
From the&s;e her sight wandered over
the cliffs and woods into the valley, along which
foamed a broad and rapid &s;tream, &s;een fall|ing
among the crags of an oppo&s;ite moun
tain, now fla&s;hing in the &s;un-beams, and
now &s;hadowed by over-arching pines,
till it was entirely concealed by their thick
foliage. Again it bur&s;t from beneath this
darkne&s;s in one broad &s;heet of foam, and
fell thundering into the vale. Nearer,
towards the we&s;t, opened the mountain|vi&s;ta,, which Emily had viewed with &s;uch
&s;ublime emotion, on her approach to the
ca&s;tle: a thin du&s;ky vapour, that ro&s;e from
<PB N="212" REF="214">
the valley, over&s;pread its features with a
&s;weet ob&s;curity. As this a&s;cended and
caught the &s;un-beams, it kindled into a
crim&s;on tint, and touched with exqui&s;ite
beauty the woods and cliffs, over which it
pa&s;&s;ed to the &s;ummit of the mountains;
then, as the veil drew up, it was delightful
to watch the gleaming objects, that pro|gre&s;&s;ively
di&s;clo&s;ed them&s;elves in the val
ley&mdash;the green turf&mdash;dark woods&mdash;little
rocky rece&s;&s;es&mdash;a few pea&s;ants' huts&mdash;the
foaming &s;tream-a herd of cattle, and va|rious
images of pa&s;toral beauty. then, the
pine-fore&s;ts brightened, and then the broad
brea&s;t of the mountains, till, at length, the
mi&s;t &s;ettled round their &s;ummit, touching
them with a ruddy glow. the feastures of
the vi&s;ta now appeared di&s;tinctly, and the
broad deep &s;hadows, that fell from the
lower cliffs, gave &s;trong effect to the &s;tream|ing
&s;plendour above; while the moun
tains, gradually &s;inking in the per&s;pec|tive,
appeared to &s;helve into the Adriatic
&s;ea, for &s;uch Emily imagined to be the
<PB N="213" REF="215">
gleam of bluei&s;h light, that terminated the
view.</P>
<P>Thus &s;he endeavoured to amu&s;e her fancy,
and was not un&s;ucce&s;sful. the breezy
fre&s;hne&s;s of the morning, too, revived her.
She rai&s;ed her thoughts in prayer, which
&s;he felt always mo&s;t di&s;po&s;ed to do, when
viewing the &s;ublimity of nature, and her
mind recovered its &s;trength.</P>
<P>When &s;he turned from the ca&s;ement,
her eyes glanced upon the door &s;he had &s;o
carefully guarded, on the preceding night,
and &s;he now determined to examine whe|ther
it led; but, on advancing to remove
the chairs, &s;he perceived, that they were
already moved a little way. Her &s;urpri&s;e
cannot ea&s;ily be imagined, when, in the
next minute, &s;he perceived that the door
was fa&s;tened.&mdash;She felt, as if &s;he had &s;een
an apparition. the door of the corridor
was locked as &s;he had left it, but this door,
which could be &s;ecured only on the
out&s;ide, mu&s;t have been bolted, during the
night. She became &s;eriou&s;ly unea&s;y at the
<PB N="214" REF="216">
thought of &s;leeping again in a chamber,
thus liable to intru&s;ion, &s;o remote, too, as it
was from the family, and &s;he determined
to mention the circum&s;tance to Madame
Montoni, and to reque&s;t a change.</P>
<P>After &s;ome perplexity &s;he found her way
into the great hall, and to the room, which
&s;he had left, on the preceding night, where
breakfa&s;t was &s;pread, and her aunt was
alone, for Montoni had been walking over
the environs of the ca&s;tle, examining the
condition of its fortifications, and talking
for &s;ome time with Carlo. Emily ob&s;erved,
that her aunt had been weeping, and her
heart &s;oftened towards her, with an affec|tion,
taht &s;hewed it&s;elf in her manner, ra ther
than in words, while &s;he carefully avoided
the appearance of having noticed, that &s;he
was unhappy. She &s;eized the opportunity
of Montoni's ab&s;ence to mention the cir|cum&s;tance
of the door, to reque&s;t that &s;he
might be allowed ano ther apartmetn, and
to enquire again, concerning the occa&s;ion
of their &s;udden journey. On the fir&s;t &s;ub|ject
<PB N="215" REF="217">
her aunt referred her to Montoni, po|&s;itively refu&s;ing to interfere in the affair; on
the la&s;t, &s;he profe&s;&s;ed utter ignorance.</P>
<P>Emily, then, with a wi&s;h of making her
aunt more reconciled to her &s;ituation, pri&s;ed
the grandeur of the ca&s;tle and the &s;urround|ing
&s;cenery, and endeavoured to &s;often
every unplea&s;ing circum&s;tance attending it.
But, though misfortune had &s;omewhat con|quered
the a&s;perities of Madme Montoni's
temper, and, by increa&s;ing her cares for
her&s;elf, had taught her to fell in &s;ome de|gree
for o thers, the capricious love of
rule, which nature had planted and habit
had nouri&s;hed in her heart, wa not &s;ub|dued.
She could not now deny her&s;elf the
grativication of tyrannizing over the innocent
and helple&s;s Emily, by attempting to ridi|cule
the ta&s;te &s;he could not feel.</P>
<P>Her &s;atirical di&s;cour&s;e was, however, in|terrupted
by the entrance of Montoni, and
her countenance immediately a&s;&s;umed a
mingled expre&s;&s;ion of fear and re&s;entment,
while he &s;eated him&s;elf at the breakfa&s;t|table,
<PB N="216" REF="218">
as if uncon&s;cious of there being any
per&s;on but him&s;elf in the room.</P>
<P>Emily, as &s;he ob&s;erved him in &s;ilence,
&s;aw, that his countenance was darker and
&s;terner than u&s;ual.&startq;O could I know,&endq;
&s;aid &s;he to her&s;elf,&startq;what pa&s;&s;es in that
mind; could I know that thoughts, that are
known there, I &s;hould no longer be con|demned
to this torturing &s;u&s;pen&s;e!&endq; their
breakfa&s;t pa&s;&s;ed in &s;ilence, till Emily ven|tured
to reque&s;t, that ano ther apartment
might be allotted to her, and related the
circum&s;tance which made her wi&s;h it.</P>
<P>&startq;I have no time to attend to the&s;e idle
whims,&endq; &s;aid Montomi,&startq;that chamber was
prepared for you, and you mu&s;t re&s;t con|tented
with it. It is not probable, that any
per&s;on would take the trouble of going to
that remote &s;tair-ca&s;e, for the purpo&s;e of
fa&s;tening a door, If it was not fa&s;tened,
when you entered the chamber, the wind,
perhaps, &s;hook the door and made the bolts
&s;lide. But I know not why I &s;hould under|take
to acccount for &s;o trifling an occurrence.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="217" REF="219">
This explanation was by no means &s;ati&s;|factory
to Emily, who had ob&s;erved, that
the bolts were ru&s;ted, and con&s;equently
could not be thsu ea&s;ily moved; but &s;he for|bore
to &s;ay &s;o, and repeated her reque&s;t.</P>
<P>&startq;If you will not relae&s;e your&s;elf from
the &s;lavery of the&s;e fears,&endq; &s;aid Montoni,
&s;ternly,&startq;at lea&s;t forbear to torment o thers
by the mention of them. Conquer &s;uch
whims, and endeavour to &s;treng then your
mind. No exi&s;tence is more contemptible
than that, which is embittered by fear.&endq; As
he &s;aid this, his eye glanced upon Ma|dame
Montoni, who coloured highly, but
was &s;till &s;ilent. Emily, wounded and di&s;|appointed,
thought her fears were, in this
in&s;tance, too rea&s;onable to de&s;erve ridicule;
but, perceiving, that, however they might op|pre&s;s
her, &s;he mu&s;t endure them, &s;he tried
to withraw her attention from the &s;ubject.
Carlo &s;oon after entered with &s;ome fruit:
&startq;Your <HI>Excellenza</HI> is tired after your long
ramble,&endq; &s;aid he, as he &s;et the fruit upon
the table;&startq;but you have more to &s;ee after
<PB N="218" REF="220">
breakfa&s;t. there is a place in the vaulted
pa&s;&s;age leading to&endq;&mdash;</P>
<P>Montoni frowned upon him, and waved
his hand fro him to leave the room. Carlo
&s;topped, looked down, and then added, as
he advanced to the breadfa&s;t-table, and took
up the basket of fruit,&startq;I made bold, your
<HI>Excellenza,</HI> to bring &s;ome cherries, here, for
my honoured lady and my young mi&s;tre&s;s.
Will your lady&s;hip ta&s;te them, madam?&endq;
&s;aid Carlo, pre&s;enting the ba&s;ket,&startq;they
are very fine ones, though I ga thered them
my&s;elf, and from an old tree, that catches
all the &s;outh &s;un; they are as big as plums
your lady&s;hip.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Very well, old Carlo,&endq;&s;aid Madame
Montoni;&startq;I am obliged to you.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;And the yound Signora, too, &s;he may
like &s;ome of them,&startq;rejoined Carlo, turnign
with the ba&s;ket to Emily,&startq;it will do me
good to &s;ee her eat &s;ome.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Thank you, Carlo,&endq; &s;aid Emily taking
&s;ome cherries, and &s;miling kindly.</P>
<P>&startq;Come, come,&endq; &s;aid Montoni, impa|tiently,
<PB N="219" REF="221">
&startq;enough of this. Leave the room,
but be in waiting. I &s;hall want you pre|&s;ently.&endq;</P>
<P>Carlos obeyed, and Montoni, &s;oon after,
went out to examine fur ther into the &s;tate
of the ca&s;tle; while Emily remained with
her aunt, patiently enduring her ill humour,
and endeavouring, with much &s;weetne&s;s, to
&s;ooth her affliction, in &s;tead of re&s;enting its
effect.</P>
<P>When Madame Montoni retired to her
dre&s;&s;ing-room, Emily endeavoured to amu&s;e
her&s;elf by a view of the ca&s;tle. Through a
folding door, vhe pa&s;&s;ed from the great hall
to the ramparts, which extended along the
brow of the precipice, round three &s;ides
of the edifice; the fourth was guarded by
the high walls of the courts, and by the gate|way,
through which &s;he had pa&s;&s;ed, on the
preceding evening. the grandeur of the
broad ramparts, and the changing &s;cenery
they opverlooked, excited her high admira|tion;
for the extent of the terraces allowed
<PB N="220" REF="222">
the features of the country to be &s;een in &s;uch
various points of view, that they appeared
to form new land&s;capes. She often pau&s;ed
to examine the gothic magnificence of
Udolpho, its proud irregularity, its lofty
towersand battlements, its high-arched
ca&s;ements, and its &s;lender watch-towers,
perched upon the corners of turrest. then
&s;he would lean on the wall of the terrace,
and, &s;huddering, mea&s;ure with her eye the
precipice below, till the dark &s;ummits of the
woods arre&s;ted it. Wherever &s;he turned,
appeared mountain-tops, fore&s;ts of pine and
narrow glens, openign among the Apennines
and retiring from the fight into inacce&s;&s;ible
regions.</P>
<P>While &s;he thus leaned, Montoni, follow|ed
by two men, appeared, a&s;cending a wind|ing
path, cut in the rock below. He &s;top|ped
upon a cliff, and, pointing to the ram|parts,
turned to his followers, and talked
with much eagerne&s;s of ge&s;ticulation.&mdash;
Emily perceived, that one of the&s;e men was
<PB N="221" REF="223">
Carlo; the o ther was in the dre&s;s of a pe|&s;ant,
and he alone &s;eemed to be receiving
the directions of Montoni.</P>
<P>She withdrew from the walls, and pur&s;ued
her walk, till &s;he heard at a di&s;tance the
&s;ound of carriage wheels, and then the loud
bell of the portal, when it in&s;tantly occur|ed
to her, that Count Morano was arrived.
As &s;he ha&s;tily pa&s;&s;ed the folding doors from
the terrace, towards her own apartment,
&s;everal per&s;ons entered the hall by an op|po&s;ite
door. She &s;aw them at the extre|mity
of the arcades, and immediately re|treated;
but the agitation of her &s;pirits, and
the extent and du&s;kine&s;s of the hall, had
prevented her from di&s;tingui&s;hing the per|&s;ons
of the &s;trangers. Her fears, however,.
had but one object, and they had called up
that object to her fancy;&mdash;&s;he believed that
&s;he had &s;een Count Morano.</P>
<P>When &s;he thought what they had pa&s;&s;ed
the hall, &s;he ventured again to the door, and
proceeded, unob&s;erved, to her room, where
&s;he remained, agitated with apprehen&s;ions,
<PB N="222" REF="224">
and li&s;tening to every di&s;tant &s;ound At
length, hearing voices on the rampart,
&s;he ha&s;tened to her window, and observed
Montoni, with Signor Cabigni, walking
below, conver&s;ing earne&s;tly, and often &s;top|pingand
turning towards each o ther, at
which times theri di&s;cour&s;e &s;eemed to be
uncommonly intere&s;ting.</P>
<P>Of the &s;everal per&s;ons who had appeared
in the hall, here wa Cavigni alone: but
Emily's alarm was &s;oon after heightened by
the &s;teps of &s;ome one in the corridor, who,
&s;he apprehended, borught a me&s;&s;age from
the Count. In the next moment, Annette
appeared.</P>
<P>&startq;Ah! ma'am&s;elle,&endq; &s;aid &s;he,&startq;here is the Signor Cavigni arrived! I am &s;ure I
rejoiced to &s;ee a chri&s;tian per&s;on in this
place; and then he is &s;o good nature too,
he always takes &s;o much notice of me!&mdash;
And here is al&s;o Signor Verezzi, and who
do you think be&s;ides, ma'am&s;elle?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I cannot gue&s;s, Annette; tell me
quickly.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="223" REF="225">
&startq;Nay, ma'am, do gue&s;s once.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Well, then,&endq; &s;aid Emily, with a&s;&s;um|ed
compo&s;ure,&startq;it is - Count Morano, I

thought you was dying, ju&s;t now.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;But the Count&mdash;you are &s;ure, is not come?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;O yes, quite &s;ure of that, ma'am&s;elle.
Why, I was looking out through the grate
<PB N="224" REF="226">
in the north turret, when the carriages drove
into the court-yard, and I never expected
to &s;ee &s;uch a goodly &s;ight in this di&s;mal
old ca&s;tle! but here are ma&s;ters and &s;ervants,
too, enough to make the place ring again.
O! I was ready to leap through the ru&s;ty
old bars, for yoi!- O! who would ever
have thought of &s;eeing a chri&s;tian face in
this huge dreary hou&s;e? I could have ki&s;&s;ed
the very hor&s;es that brought them.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Well, Annette, well, I am better now.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Yes, ma'am&s;elle, I &s;ee you are. O! all
the &s;ervants will lead merry lives here, now;

ma'am; yes, there is Ludovico, come with
them! You remember Ludovico, ma'am|a

Cavigni's lacquey&mdash;who always wears his

her loquacity.</P>
<P>&startq;What, ma'am&s;elle! don't you remem|ber
Ludovico&mdash;who rowed the Cavaliero's
gondola, at the la&s;t regatta, and won the
prizeand who u&s;ed to &s;ing &s;uch &s;weet
ver&s;es about Orlandosand about the black

<P>&startq;I fear, to they peril, my good Annettes,&endq;
&s;aid Emily;&startq;for it &s;eems his ver&s;es have

<P>&startq;Well Anneette, I am now &s;o much

<P>&startq;O, but, ma'am&s;elle, I forgot to a&s;k&mdash;

<P>&startq;O Lord! they &s;ay the room is haunted,
and has been so the&s;e many years.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;It is by a ghost, then, who can draw
bolts,&endq; &s;aid Emily, endeavouring to laugh
away her apprrehen&s;ions; &startq;for I left that
door open, la&s;t night, and found it fa&s;tenned
this mornig.&endq;</P>
<P>Annette turned pale, and &s;aid not a
word.</P>
<P>&startq;Do you know whe ther any of the &s;er|vants
fa&s;tened this door in the morning,
before I ro&s;e?'</P>
<P><PB N="227" REF="229">
&startq;No, ma'am that I will be bound they
did not: but I don't know: &s;hall I go and
a&s;k, ma'am&s;elle?&endq; &s;aid Annette, moving
ha&s;tily towards the corridor.</P>
<P>&startq;Stay, Annette, I have o ther que&s;tions

this room and whi ther that &s;tair

<P>&startq;I will go and a&s;k it all directly, ma'am;
be&s;ides, I am &s;ure my lady wants me. I
cannot &s;tay now, indeed, ma'am.&endq;</P>
<P>She hrried from the room; with|out
waiting Emily's reply, who&s;e heart,
lightened by the certainty, that Morano
was not arrived, allowed her to &s;mile at
the &s;uper&s;titious terror, which had &s;eiz
ed on Annette; for, though &s;he &s;one|times
felt its influence her&s;elf, &s;he could
&s;mile at it, when apparent in o ther per|&s;ons.</P>
<P>Montoni having refu&s;ed Emily ano ther
chamber, &s;he determiened tobear with pa|tience
the evil &s;he could not remove, and,
<PB N="228" REF="230">
in order to make the room as comfortable as
po&s;&s;ible, unpacked her books, her sweet de|light
in happier days, and her &s;oothing re|&s;ource
in the hours of moderate &s;rrow: but
there were hours when even the&s;e failed of
their effect; when the genius, the ta&s;te, the
enthu&s;ia&s;m of the &s;ublime&s;t writers were
felt no longer.</P>
<P>Her little library being arranged on a
high che&s;t, part of the furniture of the room,
&s;he took out her drawing uten&s;ils, and was
tranquil enough to be plea&s;ed with the
thought of &s;ketching the &s;ublime &s;cenes,
beheld from her windows; but &s;he &s;uddenly
checked this plea&s;ure, remembering how
often &s;he had &s;oo thed her&s;elf by the in|&s;tention
of obtaining amu&s;ement of this
kind, and had been prevented by &s;ome new
circum&s;tance of misfortune.</P>
<P>&startq;How can I &s;uffer my&s;elf to be deluded
by hope,&endq; &s;aid &s;he,&startq;and, becau&s;e Count
Morano is not yet arrived, feel a momen|tary
happine&s;s? Alas! what is it to me,
<PB N="229" REF="231">
whether he is here to-day, or to-morrow,
if he cornes at all?&mdash;and that he will come
&mdash;it were weakne&s;s to doubt.&endq;</P>
<P>To withdraw her thoughts, however,
from the &s;ubject of her misfortunes, &s;he
attempted to read, but her attention wan|dered
from the page, and, at length, &s;he
threw a&s;ide the book, and determined to
explore the adjoining chambers of the ca&s;tle.
Her imagination was plea&s;ed with the view
of ancient grandeur, and an emotion of
melancholy awe awakened all its powers,
as &s;he walked through rooms, ob&s;cure and
de&s;olate, where no foot&s;teps had pa&s; &s;ed pro|bably
for may years, and remembered the
&s;trange hi&s;tory of the former po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or of
the edifice. this brought to her recollec|tion
the veiled picture, which had attracted
her curio&s;ity, on the preceding night, and
&s;he re&s;olved to examine it. As &s;he pa&s;&s;ed
through the chambers, that led to this, &s;he
found her&s;elf &s;omewhat agitated; its con|nection
with the late lady of the ca&s;tle, and
the conver&s;ation of Annette, toge ther with
<PB N="230" REF="232">
the circum&s;tance of the veil, throwing a
my&s;tery over the &s;ubject, that excited a faint
degree of terror. But a terror of this na|ture,
as it occupies and expands the mind,
and elevates it to high expectation, is purely
&s;ublime, and leads us, by a kind of fa&s;ci|nation,
to &s;eek even the object, from which
we appear to &s;hrink.</P>
<P>Emily pa&s;&s;ed on with faltering &s;teps,
and having pau&s;ed a moment at the door,
before &s;he attempted to open it, &s;he then
ha&s;tily entered the chamber, and went to|wards
the picture, which appeared to be
enclo&s;ed in a frame of uncommon &s;ize, that
hung in a dark part of the room. She
pau&s;ed again, and then, with a timid hand,
lifted the veil; but in&s;tantly let it fall&mdash;
perceiving that what it had concealed was
no picture, and, before &s;he could leave the
chamber, &s;he dropped &s;en&s;ele&s; on the
floor.</P>
<P>when &s;he recovered her recollection, the
remembrance of what &s;he had &s;een had
nearly deprived her of it a &s;econd time.
<PB N="231" REF="233">
She had &s;earcely &s;trength to remove from
the room, and regain her own; and, when
arrived there, wanted courage to remain
alone. Horror occupied her mind, and
excluded, for a time, all &s;en&s;e of pa&s;t, and
dread of future misfortune: &s;he &s;eated
her&s;elf near the ca&s;ement, becau&s;e from
thence &s;he heard voice, though di&s;tant, on
the terrace, and might &s;ee people pa&s;s, and
the&s;e, tri&s;ling as they were, were reviving
circum&s;tances. When her &s;pirits had re|covered
their tone, &s;he con&s;idered, whe ther
&s;he &s;hould mention what &s;he had &s;een to
Madame montoni, and various and im|portant
motives urged her to do &s;o, among
which the lea&s;t was the hope of the relief,
which an overburdened mind finds in &s;peak|ing
of the &s;ubject of its intere&s;t. But &s;he
was aware of the terrible con&s;equences, which
&s;uch a communication might lead to; and,
dreading the indi&s;creation of her aunt, at
length, endeavoured to arm her&s;elf with
re&s;olution to ob&s;erve a profound &s;ilence, on
the &s;ubject. Montoni and Verezzi &s;oon
<PB N="232" REF="234">
after pa&s;&s;ed under the ca&s;ement, &s;peaking
cheerfully, and their voices revived her.
Pre&s;ently the signors Bertolini and Ca|vigni
joined the party on the terrace, and
emily, &s;uppo&s;ing that Madame Montoni
was then alone, went to &s;eek her; for the
&s;olitude of her chamber, and its proximity
to that where &s;he had received &s;o &s;evere a
&s;hock, again affected her &s;pirits.</P>
<P>She found her aunt in her dre&s;&s;ing|room,
preparing for dinner. Emily's pale
and affrighted countenance alarmed even
Madame Montoni; but &s;he had &s;ufficient
&s;trength of mind to be &s;ilent on the &s;ubject,
that &s;till made her &s;hudder, and which was
ready to burst from her lips. In her aunt's
apartment &s;he remained, till they both de|&s;cended
to dinner. there &s;he met the gen|tlemen
lately arrived, who had a kind of
bu&s;y &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s in their looks, which was
&s;omewhat unu&s;ual with them, while their
thoughts &s;eemed too much occupied by
&s;ome deep intere&s;t, to &s;uffer them to be|&s;tow
much attention ei ther on Emily, or
<PB N="233" REF="235">
Madame Montoni. they &s;poke little, and
Montoni le&s;s. Emily, as &s;he now looked
on him, &s;huddered. the horror of the
chamber ru&s;hed on her mind. several
times the colour faded from her cheeks,
and &s;he feared, that illne&s;s would betray
her emotions, and compel her to leave the
room; but the &s;trength of her re&s;solution
remedied the weakne&s;s of her frame; &s;he
obliged her&s;elf to conver&s;e, and even tried
to look cheerful.</P>
<P>Montoni evidently laboured under &s;ome
vexation, &s;uch as would probably have agi|tated
a weaker mind, or a more &s;u&s;ceptible
heart, but which appeared, from the &s;tern|ne&s;s of his countenance, only to bend up
his faculties to energy and fortitude.</P>
<P>It was a comfortle&s;s and &s;ilent meal. the
gloom of the ca&s;tle &s;eemed to have &s;pread
its contagion even over the gay countenance
of Cavigni, and with this gloom was min|gled
a fiercene&s;s, &s;uch as &s;he had &s;eldom
&s;een him indicate. Count MJorano was not
named, and what conver&s;ation there was,
<PB N="234" REF="236">
turned chiefly upon the wars, which at that
time agitated the Italian &s;tates, the &s;trength
of the Venetian armies, and the Characters
of their generals.</P>
<P>After dinner, when the &s;ervants had with|drawn,
emily learned, that the cavalier,
who had drawn upon him&s;elf the vengeance
of Orvino, had &s;ince died of his wounds,
and that &s;trict &s;earch was &s;till making for his
murderer. the intelligence &s;eemed to di&s;|turb
Montoni, who mu&s;ed, and then en|quired,
where Or&s;ino had concealed him|&s;elf.
His gue&s;ts, who all, except Ca|vigni,
were ignorant, that Montoni had
him&s;elf a&s;&s;i&s;ted him to e&s;cape from Venice,
replied, that he had fled in the night with
&s;uch precipitation and &s;ecrecy, that his
mo&s;t intimate companions knew not whe|ther.
Montoni blamed him&s;elf for having
a&s;ked the que&s;tion, for a &s;econd thought
convinced him, that a man of Or&s;ino's &s;u&s;|picious
temper was not likely to tru&s;t any of the
per&s;ons pre&s;ent with the knowledge of
his a&s;ylum. He considered him&s;elt, however,
<PB N="235" REF="237">
as entitled to his utmo&s;t confidence, and
did not doubt, that he &s;hould &s;oon hear of
him.</P>
<P>Emily retired with Madame Montoni,
&s;oon after the cloth was withdrawn, and
left the cavaliers to their &s;ecret councils,
but not before the &s;ignificant frowns of
Montoni had warned his wife to depart,
who pa&s;&s;ed from the hall to the ramparts,
and walked, for &s;ome time, in &s;ilence, which
Emily did not interrupt, for her mind was
al&s;o occupied by intere&s;ts of its own. It
required all her re&s;olution, to forbear com|municating
to Madame Montoni the ter|rible
&s;ubject, which &s;till thrilled her every
nerve with horror; and &s;ometimes &s;he was
on the point of doing &s;o, merely to obtain
the relief of a moment; but &s;he knew how
wholly &s;he was in the power of Montoni,
and, con&s;idering, that the indi&s;cretion of
her aunt might prove fatal to them both,
&s;he compelled her&s;elf to endure a pre&s;ent
and an inferior evil, ra ther than to tempt a
future and a heavier one. A &s;trange kind
<PB N="236" REF="238">
of pre&s;entiment frequently, on this day
occurred to her;&mdash;it &s;eemed as if her fate
re&s;ted here, and was by &s;ome invi&s;ble means
connected with this ca&s;tle.</P>
<P>&startq;Let me not accelerate it,&endq; &s;aid &s;he to
her&s;elf:&startq;for whatever I may be re&s;erved, let me, at lea&s;t,
avoid &s;elf-reproach.&endq;</P>
<P>As &s;he looked on the ma&s;&s;y walls of the
edifice, her melancholy &s;pirits repre&s;ented it
to be her pri&s;on and &s;he &s;tarted as at a
new &s;ugge&s;tion, when &s;he con&s;idered how
far di&s;tant &s;he was from her native country,
from her little peaceful home, and from her
only friend&mdash;how remote was her hope of
happine&s;s, how feeble the expectation of
again &s;eeing him! Yet the idea of Valan|court,
and her confidence in his faithful love,
had hi therto been her only &s;olace, and &s;he
&s;truggled hard to retain them. A few
tears of agony &s;tarted to her eyes, which &s;he
turned a&s;ide to conceal.</P>
<P>While &s;he afterwards leaned on the wall
of the rampart, &s;ome pea&s;ants, at a little di&s;|tance,
were &s;een examining a breach, before
<PB N="237" REF="239">
which lay a heap of &s;trones, as if to repair it,
and a ru&s;ty old cannon, that appeared to
have fallen from its &s;tation above. Madame
Montoni &s;topped to &s;peak to the men,
and enquired what they were going to
do.&startq;To repair the fortifications, your
lady&s;hip,&endq; &s;aid one of them; a labour
which &s;he was &s;omewhat &s;urpri&s;ed, that
Montoni &s;hould think necce&s;&s;ary, particu|larly
&s;ince he had never &s;poken of the Ca&s;tle,
as of a place, at which he meant to re&s;ide for
any con&s;iderable time; but &s;he pa&s;&s;ed on
towards a lofty arch, that led from the &s;outh
to the ea&s;t rampart, and which adjoined
the ca&s;tle, on one &s;ide, while, on the o ther,
it &s;upported a &s;mall watch-tower, that en|tirely
commanded the deep valley below.
As &s;he approached this arch, &s;he &s;aw, be|yond
it, winding along the woody de&s;cent
of a di&s;tant mountain, a long troop of
hor&s;e and foot, whom &s;he knew to be &s;ol|diers,
only by the glitter of their pikes and
o ther arms, for the di&s;tance did not allow
her to discover the colour of their liveries.
<PB N="238" REF="240">
As &s;he gazed, the vanguard i&s;&s;ued from the
woods into the valley, but the train &s;till
continued to pour over the remote &s;ummit
of the mountain, in endle&s;s &s;ucce&s;&s;ion;
while, in the front, the military uniform
became di&s;tingui&s;hable, and the command|ers,
riding fir&s;t, and &s;eeming, by their ge&s;|tures,
to direct the march of tho&s;e that fol|lowed,
at length, approached very near to
the ca&s;tle.</P>
<P>such a &s;pectacle, in the&s;e &s;olitary regions,
both &s;urpri&s;ed and alarmed madame Mon|toni,
and &s;he ha&s;tened towards &s;ome pea|&s;fants,
who were employed in rai&s;ing ba&s;tions
before the &s;outh rampart, where the rock
was le&s;es abrupt than el&s;ewhere. the&s;e men
could give no &s;atisfactory an&s;wers to her
enquiries, but, being rou&s;ed by them, gazed
in stupid a&s;toni&s;hment upon the long caval|cade.
Madame Montoni, then thinking
it nece&s;&s;ary to communicate far ther the
&s;ubject of her alarm, &s;ent Emily to &s;ay,
that &s;he wi&s;hed to &s;peak to Montoni; an
errand her niece die not approve, for &s;he
<PB N="239" REF="241">
dreaded his frowns, which &s;he knew this
me&s;&s;age would provoke; but &s;he obeyed in
&s;ilence.</P>
<P>As &s;he drew near the apartment, in which
he &s;at with his gue&s;ts, &s;he heard them in
earne&s;t and loud di&s;pute, and &s;he pau&s;ed a
moment, trembling at the di&s;plea&s;ure, which
her &s;udden interruption would occa&s;ion. In
the next, their voices &s;unk all toge ther; &s;he
then ventured to open the door, and, while
Montoni turned ha&s;tily and looked at her,
without &s;peaking, &s;he delivered her me&s;|&s;age.</P>
<P>&startq;Tell Madam Montoni I am engaged,&endq;
&s;aid he</P>
<P>Emily then throught
it proper to men|tion
the &s;ubject of her alarm. Montoni
and his companions ro&s;e in&s;tantly and went
to the windows, but, the&s;e not affording them
a view of the troops, they at length pro|ceeded
to the ramparts, where Cavigni con|jectured
it to be a legion of <HI>Condottieri,</HI> on
their march towards Modena.</P>
<P>One part of the cavalcade now extended
<PB N="240" REF="242">
along the valley, and ano ther wound among
the mountains towards the north, while
&s;ome troops &s;till lingered on the woody
precipices, where the fir&s;t had appeared,
&s;o that the great length of the proce&s;&s;ion
&s;eemed to include an whole army. While
Montoni and his family watched its pro|gre&s;s, they heard the found of trumpets and
the cla&s;h of cymbals in the vale, and then
o thers, an&s;wering from the heights. Emily
li&s;tened with emotion to the &s;hrill bla&s;t,
that woke the echoes of the mountains, and
Montoni explained the &s;ignals, with which
he appeared to be well acquainted, and
which meant nothing ho&s;tile. the uni|forms
of the troops, and the kind of arms
they bore, confirmed to him the conjecture
of Cavigni, and he had the &s;atisfaction to
&s;ee them pa&s;s by, wihtout even &s;topping
to gaze upon his ca&s;tle. He did not, how|ever,
leave the rampart, till the ba&s;es of the
mountains had &s;hut them from his view,
and the la&s;t murmur of the trumpet floated
away on the wind. Cavigni and Verezzi
<PB N="241" REF="243">
were in&s;pirited by this &s;pectacle, which
&s;eemed to have rou&s;ed all the fire of their
temper; Montoni turned into the ca&s;tle in
thoughtful &s;ilence.</P>
<P>Emily's mind had not yet &s;ufficiently
recovered from its late &s;hock, to endure the
loneline&s;s of her chamber, and &s;he re|mained
upon the ramparts; for Madame
Montoni had not invited her to her dre&s;&s;ing|room,
whi ther &s;he had gone evidently in
low &s;pirits, and Emily, from her late expe|rience,
had lo&s;t all wi&s;h to explore the
gloomy and my&s;terious rece&s;&s;es of the
ca&s;tle. The ramparts, therefore, were al|mo&s;t her only retreat, and here &s;he lingered,
till the gray laaze of evening was again
&s;pread over the &s;cene.</P>
<P>The cavaliers &s;upped by them&s;elves, and
Madame Montoni remained in her apart|ment,
whether Emily went, before &s;he re|tired
to her own. She found her aunt
weeping, and in much agitation. the ten|derne&s;s of Emily was naturally &s;o &s;oothing,
that it &s;eldom failed to give comfort to the
<PB N="242" REF="244">
drooping heart: but Madame Montoni's
was torn, and the &s;ofte&s;t accents of Emily's
voice were lo&s;t upon it. With her u&s;ual
delicacy, &s;he did not appear to ob&s;erve her
aunt's di&s;tre&s;s, but it gave an involuntary
gentlene&s;s to her manners, and an air of fo|licitude
to her countenance, which ma|dame
Montoni was vexed to perceive, who
&s;eemed to feel the pity of her niece to be an
in&s;ult to her pride, and di&s;mi&s;&s;ed her as
&s;oon as &s;he properly could. Emily did not
venture to mention again the reluctance
&s;he felt to her gloomy chamber, but &s;he
requeted that Annette might be permitted
to remain with her till &s;he retired to re&s;t;
and the reque&s;t was &s;omewhat reluctantly
granted. Annette, however, was now with
the &s;ervats, and Emily withdrew alone.</P>
<P>With light and ha&s;ty &s;teps &s;he feeble
glimmer of the lamp &s;he carried only &s;hew|ed
the gloom around her, and the pa&s;&s;ing
air threatened to extingui&s;h it. the lonely
&s;ilence, that reigned in this part of the ca&s;tle,
<PB N="243" REF="245">
awed her; now and then, indeed, &s;he heard
a faint peal of laughter ri&s;e from a remote
part of the edifice, where the &s;ervants were
a&s;&s;embled, but it was &s;oon lo&s;t, and a &s;kind
of breathle&s;s &s;tillne&s;s remained. As &s;he
pa&s;&s;ed the &s;uite of rooms which &s;he had vi|&s;ited
in the morning, her eyes glanced fear|fully
on the door, and &s;he almo&s;t fancied &s;he1
heard murmuring &s;ounds within, but &s;he
pau&s;ed not a moment to enquire.</P>
<P>Having reached her own apartment,
where no blazing wood on the hearth di&s;&s;i|pated
the gloom, &s;he &s;at down with a book,
to enliven her atention, till Annette &s;hould
come, and a fire could be kindled. she
continued to read till her light was nearly
expired, but Annette did not appear, and
the &s;olitude and ob&s;curity of her chamber
again affected her &s;pirits, the more, beacu&s;e
of its nearne&s;s to the &s;cene of horror, that
&s;he had witne&s;&s;ed in the morning. Gloomy
and fanta&s;tic images came to her mind.
She looked fearfully towards the door of
<PB N="244" REF="246">
the &s;tair- ca&s;e, and then, examining whe ther
it was &s;till fa&s;tened, found that it was &s;o.
Unable to conquer the unea&s;ine&s;s &s;he felt
at the pro&s;pect of &s;leeping again in this
remote and in&s;ecure apartment, which &s;ome
per&s;on &s;eemed to have entered during the pre|ceding
night her impatience to &s;ee Annette,
whom &s;he had bidden to enquire concerning
this circum&s;tance, became extremely painful.
She wi&s;hed al&s;o to que&s;tion her, as to the
object, which had excited &s;o much horror
in her own mind, and which Annette on
the preceding evening had appeared to be
in part acquainted with, though her words
were very remote from the truth, and it
appeared plainly to Emily, that the girl
had been purpo&s;ely mi&s;led by a fal&s;e re|port:
above all &s;he was &s;urpri&s;ed, that the
door of the chamber, which contained it,
&s;hould be left unguarded. Such an in|&s;tance
of negligence almost &s;urpa&s;&s;ed be|lief.
But her light was now expiring; the
faint fla&s;hes it threw upon the walls called
<PB N="245" REF="247">
up all the terrors of fancy, and &s;he ro&s;e to
find her way to the habitable part of the
ca&s;tle, before it was quite extingui&s;hed.</P>
<P>As &s;he opened the chamber door, &s;he
heard remote voices, and, &s;ocn after, &s;aw a
light i&s;&s;ue upon the fur ther end of the
corridor, which Annette and ano ther &s;er|vant
approached.&startq;I am glad you are
come,&endq; &s;aid Emily:&startq;what has detained
you &s;o long? Pray light me a fire imme|diately.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;My lady wanted me, ma'am&s;elle,&endq; re|plied
Annette in &s;ome confu&s;ion;&startq;I will
go and get the wood.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;No,&endq; &s;aid Caterina,&startq;that is my
bu&s;ine&s;s,&endq; and left the room in&s;tantly,
while Annette would have followed; but,
being called back, &s;he began to talk very
loud, and laugh, and &s;eemed afraid to tru&s;t
a pau&s;e of &s;ilence.</P>
<P>Caterina &s;oon returned with the wood,
and then, when the cheerful blaze once
more animated the room, and this &s;ervant
had withdrawn, Emily a&s;ked Annette, whe|ther
<PB N="246" REF="248">
&s;he had made the enquiry &s;he bade
her.&startq;Yes, ma'am&s;elle,&startq;&s;aid Annette,
&endq; but not a &s;oul knows any thing about
the matter: and old Carlo,&mdash;I watched him
well, for they &s;ay he knows &s;trange things&mdash;
old Carlo looked &s;o as I don't know how
to tell, and he a&s;ked me again and again,
if I was &s;ure the door was ever unfa&s;ten|ted.
Lord, &s;ays I&mdash;am I &s;ure I am alive?
And as for me, ma'am, I am all a&s;tounded,
as one may &s;ay, and would no more &s;leep
in this chamber, than I would on the great
cannon at the end of the east rampart.&endq;
&startq;And what objection have you to that
cannon, more than to any of the re&s;t?&endq;
&s;aid Emily &s;miling:&startq;the be&s;t would be
ra ther a hard bed.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Yes, ma'am&s;elle, any of them would
be hard enough for that matter; but they
do &s;ay, that &s;omething has been &s;een in the
dead of night, &s;tanding be&s;ide the great
cannon, as if to guard it.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Well! my good Annette, the people
who tell &s;uch &s;tories, are happy in having
<PB N="247" REF="249">
you for an auditor, for I perceive you be|lieve
them all.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Dear ma'am&s;elle! I will &s;hew you the
very cannon; You can &s;ee it from the&s;e
windows!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Well,&endq; &s;aid Emily,&startq;but that does
not prove, that an apparition guards it.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;What! not if I &s;hew you the very
cannon! Dear ma'am, you will believe
nothing.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Nothing probably upon this &s;ubject,
But what I &s;ee,&endq; &s;aid Emily.&mdash;&startq;Well,
ma'am, but you &s;hall &s;ee it, if you will on|ly
&s;tep this way to the ca&s;ement.&endq;&mdash;Emily
could not forbear laughing, and Annette
looked &s;urpri&s;ed. Perceiving her extreme
aptitude to credit the marvellous, Emily
forbore to mention the &s;ubject &s;he had in|tended,
le&s;t it &s;hould overcome her with
ideal terrrors, and &s;he began to &s;peak on a
lively topic&mdash;the regattas of Venice.</P>
<P>&startq;Aye, ma'am&s;elle, tho&s;e rowing matches,&endq;
&s;aid Annette,&startq;and the fine moon-light
nights, are all, that are worth &s;eeing in Ve|nice.
<PB N="248" REF="250">
To be &s;ure that moon is brighter
than any I ever &s;aw, and then to hear &s;uch
&s;weet mu&s;ic, too, as Ludovico has often
and often &s;ung under the lattice by the
we&s;t portico! Ma'am&s;elle, it was Ludovico,
that told me about that picture, which you
wanted &s;o to look at la&s;t night, and&mdash;&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;What picture?&endq; &s;aid Emily, wi&s;hing
Annette to explain her&s;eslf.</P>
<P>&startq;O! that terrible picture with the black
veil over it.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;You never &s;aw it, then?&endq; &s;aid Emily.</P>
<P>&startq;Who, I!&mdash;No, ma'am&s;elle, I never did,
But this morning,&endq; continued Annette, low|ering
her voice, and looking round the
room,&startq;this morning, as it was broad day|light,
do you know, ma'am, I took a
&s;trange fancy to &s;ee it, as I had heard &s;uch
odd hints about it, and I got as far as the
door, and &s;hould have opened it, if it had
not been locked!&endq;</P>
<P>Emily, endeavouring to conceal the
emotion this circum&s;tance occationed, en|quired
at what hour &s;he went to the cham|ber,
<PB N="249" REF="251">
and found, that it was &s;oon after her|&s;self
had been there. She al&s;o a&s;ked fur|ther
que&s;tions, and the an&s;wers convinced
her, that Annette, and probably her in|former,
were ignorant of the terrible
truth, though in Annette's account &s;ome|thing
very like the truth, now and then,
mingled with the fal&s;ehood. Emily now
began to fear, that her vi&s;it to the chamber
had been ob&s;erved, &s;ince the door had
been clo&s;ed, &s;o immediately after her de|parture;
and dreaded le&s;t this &s;hould draw
upon her the vengeance of Montoni. Her
anxiety, al&s;o, was excited to know whence
and for what purpo&s;e, the delu&s;ive report,
which had been impo&s;ed upon Annette,
had originated, &s;ince Montoni could only
have wi&s;hed for &s;ilence and &s;ecrecy; but
&s;he felt, that the &s;ubject was too terrible
for this lonely hour, and &s;he compelled
her&s;elf to leave it, to conver&s;e with Annette,
who&s;e chat, &s;imple as it was, &s;he prefer|red
to the &s;tillne&s;s of total &s;olitude.</P>
<P>Thus they &s;at, till near midnight, but
<PB N="250" REF="252">
not without many hints from Annette, that
&s;he wi&s;hed to go. The embers were now nearly
burnt out; and Emily heard, at a di&s;tance,
the thundering &s;ound of the hall doors, as
they were &s;hut for the night. She, therefore,
prepared for re&s;t, but was &s;till unwilling
that Annette &s;hould leave her. At this in|&s;tant,
the great bell of the portal &s;ounded.
They li&s;tened in fearful expectation, when,
after a long pau&s;e of &s;ilence, it &s;ounded
again. Soon after, they heard the noi&s;e of
carriage wheels in the court-yard. Emily
&s;unk almo&s;t lifele&s;s in her chair; &startq;It is the
Count,&endq; &s;aid &s;he.</P>
<P>&startq;What, at this time of night, ma'am!&endq;
&s;aid Annette; &startq;no, my dear lady. But, for
that matter, it is a &s;trange time of night for
any body to come!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Nay, pr'ythee, good Annette, &s;tay not
talking,&endq; &s;aid Emily in a voice of agnoy&mdash;
&startq;Go, pr'ythee, go, and &s;ee who it is.&endq;</P>
<P>Annette left the room, and carried with her the light, leaving Emily in darkne&s;s,
which a few moments before would have
<PB N="251" REF="253">
terrified her in this room, but was now
&s;carcely ob&s;erved by her. She li&s;tened and
waited, in breathle&s;s expectation, and heard
di&s;tant noi&s;es, but Annette did not return.
Her patience, at length, exhau&s;ted, &s;he tried
to find her way to the corridor, but it was
long before &s;he could touch the door of the
chamber, and, when &s;he had opened it, the
total darkne&s;s without made her fear to pro|ceed.
Voices were now heard, and Emily
even thought &s;he di&s;tingui&s;hed tho&s;e of
Count Morano, and Montoni. Soon after,
&s;he heard &s;teps approaching, and then a ray
of light &s;treamed through the darkne&s;s, and
Annette appeared, whom Emily went to
meet.</P>
<P>&startq;Yes, ma'am&s;elle,&endq; &s;aid &s;he,&startq;you was
right, it is the Count &s;ure enough.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;It is he!&endq; exclaimed Emily, lifting her
eyes towards heaven and &s;upporting her&s;elf
by Annette's arm.</P>
<P>&startq;Good Lord! My dear lady, don't be in
&s;uch a &s;lu&s;ter, and look &s;o pale, we &s;hall
&s;oon hear more.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="252" REF="254">
&startq;We &s;hall, indeed!&endq; &s;aid Emily, moving
as fa&s;t as &s;he was able towards her apart|ment.
&startq;I am not well; give me air.&endq;
Annette opened a ca&s;ement,and brought
water. The faintne&s;s &s;oon left Emily, but
&s;he de&s;ired Annette would not go till &s;he
heard from Montoni.</P>
<P>&startq;Dear ma'am&s;elle! he &s;urely will not
di&s;turb you at this time of night; why he
mu&s;t think you are a&s;leep.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Stay with me till I am &s;o, then,&endq; &s;aid
Emily, who felt temporary relief from this
&s;ugge&s;tion, which appeared probable enough,
though her fears had prevented its occurring
to her. Annette, with &s;ecret reluctance,
con&s;ented to &s;tay, and Emily was now com|po&s;ed
enough to a&s;k her &s;ome que&s;tions;
among others, whether &s;she had &s;een the
Count.</P>
<P>&startq;Yes, ma'am, I &s;aw him alight, for I
went from hence to the grate in the north
turret, that overlooks the inner court-yard,
you know. There I &s;aw the Count's car|rige,
and the Count in it, waiting at the
<PB N="253" REF="255">
great door,&mdash;for the porter was ju&s;t gone to
bed&mdash;with &s;everal men on hor&s;eback all by
the light of the torches they carried.&endq;&mdash;
Emily was compelled to &s;mile. &startq;When the
door was opened, the Count &s;aid &s;omething,
that I could not make out, and then got out,
and another gentleman with him. I thought,
to be &s;ure, the Signor was gone to bed, and
I ha&s;tened away to my lady's dre&s;&s;ing-room,
to &s;ee what I could hear. But in the way
I met Ludovico, and he told me that the
Signor was up, coun&s;elling with his ma&s;ter
and the other Signors, in the room at the
end of the north gallery; and Ludovico
held up his finger, and laid it on his lips, as
much as to &s;ay&mdash;There is more going on,
than you think of, Annette, but you mu&s;t
hold your tongue. And &s;o I did hold my
tongue, ma'am&s;elle, and came away to tell
you directly.&endq;</P>
<P>Emily enquired who the cavalier was,
that accompanied the Count, and how
Montoni received them;but Annette could
not inform her.</P>
<P><PB N="254" REF="256">
&startq;Ludovice,&endq; &s;he added,&endq; had ju&s;t been
to call Signor Montoni's valet, that he might
tell him they were arrived, when I met him.&endq;</P>
<P>Emily &s;at mu&s;ing, for &s;ome time, and then
her anxiety was &s;o much increa&s;ed, that &s;he
de&s;ired Annette would go to the &s;evants'
hall, where it was po&s;&s;ible &s;he might hear
&s;omething of the Count's intention, re&s;pect|ing
his &s;tay at the ca&s;tle.</P>
<P>&startq;Yes, ma'am,&endq; &s;aid Annette with readi|ne&s;s;
&startq;but how am I to find the way, if I
leave the lamp with you?&endq;</P>
<P>Emily &s;aid &s;he would light her, and they
immediately quitted the chamber. When
they had reached the top of the great &s;tair|ca&s;e,
Emily recollected, that &s;he might be
&s;een by the Count, and, to avoid the great
hall, Annette conducted her through &s;ome
private pa&s;&s;ages to a back &s;tair-ca&s;e, which
led directly to that of the &s;ervants.</P>
<P>As &s;he returned towards her chamber,
Emily began to fear, that &s;he might again
lo&s;e her&s;elf in the intricacies of the ca&s;tle,
and again be &s;hocked by &s;ome my&s;terious
<PB N="255" REF="257">
&s;pectacle; and, though &s;he was already per|plexed
by the numerous turnings, &s;he feared
to open one of the many doors, that offered.
While &s;he &s;tepped thoughtfully along, &s;he
fancied, that &s;he heard a low moaning at no
great di&s;tance, and, having pau&s;ed a mo|ment,
&s;he heard it again and di&s;tinctly. Se|veral
doors appeared on the right hand of
the pa&s;&s;age. She advanced, and li&s;tened.
When &s;he came to the &s;econd, &s;he heard a
voice, apparently in complaint, within, to
which she continued to li&s;ten, afraid to open
the door, and unwilling to leave it. Con|vul&s;ive
&s;obs followed, and then the piercing
accents of an agonizing &s;pirit bur&s;t forth.
Emily &s;tood appalled, and looked through
the gloom, that &s;urrounded her, in fearful
expectation. The lamentations continued.
Pity now began to &s;ubdue terror; it was
po&s;&s;ible &s;he might admini&s;ter comfort to
the &s;ufferer, at lea&s;t, by expre&s;&s;ing &s;ympathy,
and &s;he laid her hand on the door. While
&s;he he&s;itated &s;he thougth &s;he knew this voice,
di&s;gui&s;ed as it was by tones of grief. Having,
<PB N="256" REF="258">
therefore, &s;et down the lamp in the pa&s;&s;age,
&s;he gently opened the door, within which all
was dark, except that form an inner apart|ment
a partial light appeared; and &s;he &s;tep|ped
&s;oftly on. Before &s;he reached it, the
appearance of Madame Montoni, leaning on
her dre&s;&s;ing-table, weeping, and with a
handkerchief held to her eyes, &s;truck her,
and &s;he pau&s;ed.</P>
<P>Some per&s;on was &s;eated in a chair by the
fire, but who it was &s;he could not di&s;tingui&s;h.
He &s;poke, now and then, in a low voice,
that did not allow Emily to hear what was
uttered, but &s;he thought, that Madame
Montoni, at tho&s;e times, wept the more,
who was too much occupied by her own
di&s;tre&s;s, to ob&s;erve Emily, while the latter,
though anxious to know what occa&s;ioned
this, and who was the per&s;on admitted at &s;o
late an hour to her aunt's dre&s;&s;ing-room,
forbore to add to her &s;ufferings by &s;urpri&s;ing
her, or to take advantage of her &s;ituation,
by li&s;tening to a private di&s;cour&s;e. She,
therefore, &s;tepped &s;oftly back, and, after
<PB N="257" REF="259">
&s;ome further difficulty, found the way to
her own chamber, where nearer intere&s;ts, at
length, excluded the &s;urpri&s;e and concern
&s;he had felt, re&s;pecting Madame Montoni.</P>
<P>Annette, however, returned without &s;ati&s;|factory
intelligence, for the &s;ervants, among
whom &s;he had been, were either entirely ig|norant,
or affected to be &s;o, concerning the
Count's intended &s;tay at the ca&s;tle. They
could talk only of the &s;teep and broken road
they had ju&s;t pa&s;&s;ed, and of the numerous
dangers they had e&s;caped, and expre&s;s won|der
how their lord could choo&s;e to encoun|ter
all the&s;e, in the darkne&s;s of night; for
they &s;carcely allowed, that the torches had
&s;erved for any other purpo&s;e but that of
&s;hewing the drearine&s;s of the mountains.
Annette, finding &s;he could gain no infor|mation,
le&s;t them, making noi&s;y petitions,
for more wood on the fire and more &s;upper
on the table.</P>
<P>&startq;And now, ma'am&s;elle,&endq; added &s;he,&endq; I
am &s;o &s;leepy!&mdash;I am &s;ure, if you was &s;o
<PB N="258" REF="260">
&s;leepy, you would not de&s;ire me to &s;it up
with you.&endq;</P>
<P>Emily, indeed, began to think it was
cruel to wi&s;h it; &s;he had al&s;o waited &s;o
long, without receiving a &s;ummons from
Montoni, that it appeared he did not mean
to di&s;turb her, at this late hour, and &s;he de|termined
to di&s;mi&s;s Annette. But, when &s;he
again looked round her gloomy chamber,
and recollected certain circum&s;tances, fear
feized her &s;pirits, and &s;he he&s;itated.</P>
<P>&startq;And yet it were cruel of me to a&s;k you
to &s;tay, till I am a&s;leep, Annette,&endq; &s;aid &s;he,
&startq;for I fear it will be very long before I for|get
my&s;elf in &s;leep.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I dare &s;ay it will be very long, ma'am|&s;elle,&endq;
&s;aid Annette.</P>
<P>&startq;But, before you go,&endq; rejoined Emily,
&startq;let me a&s;k you&mdash;Had Signor Montoni
left Count Morano, when you quitted the
hall?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;O no, ma'am, they were alone to|gether.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="259" REF="261">
&startq;Have you been in my aunt's dre&s;&s;ing|room,
&s;ince you left me?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;No, ma'am&s;elle, I called at the door as
I pa&s;&s;ed, but it was fa&s;tened; &s;o I thought
my lady was gone to bed.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Who, then, was with your lady ju&s;t
now?&endq; &s;aid Emily,forgetting, in &s;urpri&s;e,
her u&s;ual prudence.</P>
<P>&startq;Nobody, I believe, ma'am,&endq; replied An|nette,
&startq;nobody had been with her, I be|lieve,
&s;ince I left you.&endq;</P>
<P>Emily took no further notice of the &s;ub|ject,
and, after &s;ome &s;truggle with imaginary
fears, her good nature prevailed over them
&s;o far, that &s;he di&s;mi&s;&s;ed Annette for the
night. She then &s;at, mu&s;ing upon her own
circum&s;tances and tho&s;e of Madame Mon|toni,
till her eye re&s;ted on the miniature
picture, which &s;he had found, after her fa|ther's
death, among the papers he had en|joined
her to de&s;tory. It was open upon
the table, before her, among &s;ome loo&s;e
drawings, having, with them, been taken
out of a little box by Emily, &s;ome hours
<PB N="260" REF="262">
before. The &s;ight of it called up many in|tere&s;ting
reflections, but the melancholy
&s;weetne&s; of the countenance foothed the
emotions, which the&s;e had occafioned. It
was the &s;ame &s;tyle of countenance as that of
her late father, and, while &s;he gazed on it
with fondne&s;s on this account, &s;he even
fancied a re&s;emblance in the features. But
this tranquillity was &s;uddenly interrupted,
when &s;he recollected the words in the ma|nu&s;cript,
that had been found with this pic|ture,
and which had formerly occa&s;ioned
her &s;o much doubt and horror. At length,
&s;he rou&s;ed her&s;elf from the deep reverie,
into which this remembrance had thrown
her; but, when &s;he ro&s;e to undre&s;s, the
&s;ilence and &s;olitude, to which &s;he was left,
at this midnight hour, for not even a di&s;tant
&s;ound was now heard, con&s;pired with the
impre&s;&s;ion the &s;ubject &s;he had been con&s;i|dering
had given to her mind, to appall
her. Annette's hints, too, concerning
this chamber, &s;imple as they were, had
not failed to affect her, &s;ince they fol|lowed
<PB N="261" REF="263">
a circum&s;tance of peculiar horror,
which &s;he her&s;elf had witne&s;&s;ed, and &s;ince
the &s;cene of this was a chamber nearly ad|joining
her own.</P>
<P>The door of the &s;tair-ca&s;e was, perhaps,
a &s;ubject of more rea&s;onable alarm, and &s;he
now began to apprehend, &s;uch was the ap|titude
of her fears, that this &s;tair-ca&s;e had
&s;ome private communication with the apart|ment,
which &s;he &s;huddered even to remem|ber.
Determined not to undre&s;s, &s;he lay
down to &s;leep in her clothes, with her late
father's dog, the faithful <HI>Manchon,</HI> at the
foot of the bed, whom &s;he con&s;idered as a
kind of guard.</P>
<P>Thus circum&s;tanced, &s;he tried to bani&s;h
reflection, but her bu&s;y fancy would &s;till
hover over the &s;ubjects of her intere&s;t, and
&s;he heard the clock of the ca&s;tle &s;trike two,
before &s;he clo&s;ed her eyes.</P>
<P>From the di&s;turbed &s;lumber, into which
&s;he then &s;unk, &s;he was &s;oon awakened by a
noi&s;e, which &s;eemed to ari&s;e within her cham|ber;
but the &s;ilence, that prevailed, as &s;he
<PB N="262" REF="264">
Fearfully li&s;tened, inclined her to believe,
that &s;he had been alarmed by &s;uch &s;ounds
as &s;ometimes occur in dreams, and &s;he laid
her head again upon the pillow.</P>
<P>A return of the noi&s;e again di&s;turbed
her; it &s;eemed to come from that part of
the room, which communicated with the
private &s;tair-ca&s;e, and &s;he in&s;tantly remem|bered
the odd circum&s;tance of the door
having been fa&s;tened, during the preceding
night, by &s;ome unknown hand. Her late
alarming &s;u&s;picion, concerning its com|munication,
al&s;o occurred to her. Her heart
became faint with terror. Half rai&s;ing her|&s;elf
from the bed, and gently drawing a&s;ide
the curtain, &s;he looked towards the door of
the &s;tair-ca&s;e, but the lamp, that burnt on the
hearth, &s;pread &s;o feeble a light through the
apartment, that the remote parts of it were
lost in &s;hadow. The noi&s;e, however, which,
&s;he was convinced, came from the door, con|tinued.
It &s;eemed like that made by the un|drawing
of ru&s;ty bolts, and often cea&s;ed,
and was then renewed more gently, as
<PB N="263" REF="265">
if the hand, that occa&s;ioned it, was re&s;trained
by a fear of di&s;covery.While Emily kept
her eyes fixed on the &s;pot, &s;he &s;aw the door
move, and then &s;lowly open, and perceived
&s;omething enter the room, but the extreme
du&s;kine&s;s prevented her di&s;tingui&s;hing what
it was. Almo&s;t fainting with terror, &s;he
had yet &s;ufficient command over her&s;elf, to
check the &s;hriek, that was e&s;caping from her
lips, and, letting the curtain drop from her
hand, continued to ob&s;erve in &s;ilence the mo|tions
of the my&s;terious form &s;he &s;aw. It &s;eem|ed
to glide along the remote ob&s;curity of the
apartment, then pau&s;ed, and, as it approach|ed
the hearth, &s;he perceived, in the &s;tronger
light, what appeared to be a human figure.
Certain remembrances now &s;truck upon her
heart, and almo&s;t &s;ubdued the feeble re|mains
of her &s;pirits; &s;he continued, how|ever,
to watch the figure, which remained
for &s;ome time motionle&s;s, but then, advan|cing
&s;lowly towards the bed, &s;tood &s;ilently at
the feet, where the curtains, being a little
open, allowed her &s;till to &s;ee it; terror,
<PB N="264" REF="266">
however, had now deprived her of the
power of di&s;crimination, as well as of that
of utterance.</P>
<P>Having continued there a moment, the
form retreated towards the hearth, when it
took the lamp, held it up, &s;urveyed the
chamber, for a few moments, and then
again advanced towards the bed. The
light at that in&s;tant awakening the dog,
that had &s;lept at Emily's feet, he barked
loudly and, jumping to the floor, flew at
the &s;tranger, who &s;truck the animal &s;martly
with a &s;heathed &s;word, and, &s;pringing towards
the bed, Emily di&s;covered&mdash;Count Morano!</P>
<P>She gazed at him for a moment in &s;peech|le&s;s
affright, while he, throwing him&s;elf on
his knee at the bed-&s;ide, be&s;ought her to
fear nothing, and, having thrown down his
&s;word, would have taken her hand, when
the faculties, that terror had &s;u&s;pended, &s;ud|denly
returned; and &s;he &s;prung from the
bed, in the dre&s;s, which &s;urely a kind of
prophetic apprehen&s;ion had prevented her,
on this night, from throwing a&s;ide.</P>
<P><PB N="265" REF="267">
Morano ro&s;e, followed her to the door,
through which he had entered, and caught
her hand, as &s;he reached the top of the &s;tair|ca&s;e,
but not before &s;he had di&s;covered, by
the gleam of a lamp, another man half-way
down the &s;teps. She now &s;creamed in de|&s;pair,
and, believing her&s;elf given up by
Montoni, &s;aw, indeed, no po&s;&s;ibility of
e&s;cape.</P>
<P>The Count, who &s;till held her hand, led
her back into the chamber.</P>
<P>&startq;Why all this terror?&endq; &s;aid he, in a tre|mulous
voice. &startq;Hear me, Emily: I come
not to alarm you; no, by Heaven! I love
you too well&mdash;too well for my own peace.&endq;</P>
<P>Emily looked at him for a moment, in
fearful doubt.</P>
<P>&startq;Then leave me, &s;ir,' &s;aid &s;he, &startq;leave
me in&s;tantly.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Hear me, Emily,&endq; re&s;umed Morano,
&startq;hear me! I love, and am in de&s;pair&mdash;yes
&mdash;in de&s;pair. How can I gaze upon you,
and know, that it is, perhaps, for the la&s;t
time, without &s;uffering all the phren&s;y of de|&s;pair?
<PB N="266" REF="268">
But it &s;hall not be &s;o; you &s;hall
be mine, in &s;pite of Montoni and all his
villany.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;In &s;pite of Montoni!&endq; cried Emily
eagerly: &startq;what is it I hear?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;You hear, that Montoni is a villain,&endq;
exclaimed Morano with vehemence,&mdash;&startq;a
villain who would have &s;old you to my
love!&mdash;Who&mdash;&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;And is he le&s;s, who would have bought
me?&endq; &s;aid Emily, fixing on the Count an
eye of calm contempt. &startq;Leave the room,
&s;ir, in&s;tantly,&endq; &s;he continued in a voice,
trembling between joy and fear, &startq;or I will
alarm the family, and you may receive that
from Signor Montoni's vengeance, which I
have vainly &s;upplicated from his pity.&endq;
But Emily knew, that &s;he was beyond the
hearing of tho&s;e, who might protect her.</P>
<P>&startq;You can never hope any thing from his
pity,&endq; &s;aid Morano, &startq;he has u&s;ed me in|famou&s;ly,
and my vengeance &s;hall pur&s;ue
him. And for you, Emily, for you, he has
new plans more profitable than the la&s;t, no
<PB N="267" REF="269">
doubt.&endq; The gleam of hope, which the
Count's former &s;peech had revived, was
now nearly extingui&s;hed by the latter; and,
while Emily's countenance betrayed the
emotions of her mind, he endeavoured to
take advantage of the di&s;covery.</P>
<P>&startq;I lo&s;e time,&endq; &s;aid he: &startq;I came not to
exclaim again&s;t Montoni; I came to &s;olicit,
to plead&mdash;to Emily; to tell her all I &s;uffer,
to entreat her to &s;ave me from de&s;pair, and
her&s;elf from de&s;truction. Emily! the &s;chemes
of montoni are in&s;earchable, but, I warn
you, they are terrible; he has no principle,
when intere&s;t, or ambition leads. Can I
love you, and abandon you to his power?
Fly, then, fly from this gloomy pri&s;on, with
a lover, who adores you! I have bribed a
&s;ervant of the ca&s;tle to open the gates, and,
before to-morrow's dawn, you &s;hall be far
on the way to Venice.&endq;</P>
<P>Emily, overcome by the &s;udden &s;hock
&s;he had received, at the moment, too, when
&s;he had begun to hope for better days, now
thought &s;he &s;aw de&s;truction &s;urround her on
<PB N="268" REF="270">
every &s;ide. Unable to reply, and almo&s;t to
think, &s;he threw her&s;elf into a chair, pale
and breathle&s;s. That Montoni had for|merly
&s;old her to Morano, was very proba|ble;
that he had now withdrawn his con|&s;ent
to the marriage, was evident from the
Count's pre&s;ent conduct; and it was nearly
certain, that a &s;cheme of &s;tronger intere&s;t
only could have induced the &s;elfi&s;h Mon|toni
to forego a plan, which he had hitherto
&s;o &s;trenuou&s;ly pur&s;sued. The&s;e reflections
made her tremble at the hints, which Mo|rono
had ju&s;t given, which &s;he no longer
he&s;itated to believe; and, while &s;he &s;hrunk
from the new &s;cenes of mi&s;ery and oppre&s;|&s;ion,
that might await her in the ca&s;tle of
Udolpho, &s;he was compelled to ob&s;erve,
that almo&s;t her only means of e&s;caping
them was by &s;ubmitting her&s;elf to the pro|tection
of this man, with whom evils more certain and not le&s;t terrible appeared,&mdash;evils,
upon which &s;he could not endure to pau&s;e
for an in&s;tant.</P>
<P>Her &s;ilence, though it was that of agony,
<PB N="269" REF="271">
encouraged the hopes of Morano, who
watched her countenance with impatience,
took again the re&s;i&s;ting hand &s;he had with|drawn,
and, as he pre&s;&s;ed it to his heart,
again conjured her to determine immediate|ly.
&startq;Every moment we lo&s;e, will make our
departure more dangerous,&endq; &s;aid he: &startq;the&s;e
few moments lo&s;t may enable Montoni to
overtake us.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I be&s;eech you, &s;ir, be &s;ilent,&endq; &s;aid
Emily faintly: &startq;I am indeed very wretch|ed,
and wretched I mu&s;t remain. Leave
me&mdash;I command you, leave me to my
fate.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Never!&endq; cried the Count vehemently:
&startq;let me peri&s;h fir&s;t! But forgive my vio|lence!
the thought of lo&s;ing you is madne&s;s.
You cannot be ignorant of Montoni's cha|racter,
you may be ignorant of his &s;chemes
&mdash;nay, you mu&s;t be &s;o, or you would not
he&s;itate between my love and his power.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Nor do I he&s;itate,&endq; &s;aid Emily.</P>
<P>&startq;Let us go, then,&endq; &s;aid Morano, eagerly
<PB N="270" REF="272">
ki&s;&s;ing her hand, and ri&s;ing, &startq;my carriage
waits, below the ca&s;tle walls.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;You mi&s;take me, &s;ir,&endq; &s;aid Emily.
&startq;Allow me to thank you for the intere&s;t
you expre&s;s in my welfare, and to decide by
my own choice. I &s;hall remain under the
protection of Signor Montoni.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Under his protection!&endq; exclaimed Mo|rano,
proudly, &startq;his <HI>protection!</HI> Emily,
why will you &s;uffer your&s;elf to be thus de|luded?
I have already told you what you
have to expect form his <HI>protection.&endq;</HI></P>
<P>&startq;And pardon me, &s;ir, if, in this in&s;tance,
I doubt mere a&s;&s;ertion, and, to be convinced,
require &s;omething approaching to proof.&endq;</P>
<P>I have now neither the time, or the'
means of adducing proof,&endq; replied the
Count.</P>
<P>&startq;Nor have I, &s;ir, the inclination to li&s;ten
to it, if you had.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;But you trifle with my patience and my di&s;tre&s;s,&endq; continued Morano. &startq;Is a
marriage with a man, who adores you, &s;o
<PB N="271" REF="273">
very terrible in your eyes, that you would
prefer to it all the mi&s;ery, to which Mon|toni
may condemn you in this remote pri|son?
Some wretch mu&s;t have &s;tolen tho&s;e
affections, which ought to be mine, or you
could not thus ob&s;tinately per&s;i&s;t in re|fu&s;ing
an offer, that would place you be|yond
the reach of oppre&s;&s;ion.&endq; Morano
walked about the room, with quick &s;teps,
and a di&s;turbed air.</P>
<P>&startq;Thus di&s;cour&s;e, Count Morano, &s;uffi|ciently
proves, that my affections ought not
to be yours,&endq; &s;aid Emily, mildly, &startq;and
this conduct, that I &s;hould not be placed
beyond the reach of oppre&s;&s;ion, &s;o long as I
remained in your power. If you wi&s;h me
to believe otherwi&s;e, cea&s;e to oppre&s;s me
any longer by your pre&s;ence. If you re|fu&s;e
this, you will compel me to expo&s;e you
to the re&s;entment of Signor Montoni.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Yes let him come,&endq; cried Morano furi|ou&s;ly,
&startq;and brave <HI>my</HI> re&s;entment! Let
him dare to face once more the man he has
&s;o courageou&s;ly injured; danger &s;hall teach
<PB N="272" REF="274">
him morality, and vengeance ju&s;tice&mdash;let
him come, and receive my &s;word in his
heart!&endq;</P>
<P>The vehemence, with which this was ut|tered,
gave Emily new cau&s;e of alarm, who
aro&s;e from her chair, but her trembling frame
refu&s;ed to &s;upport her, and &s;he re&s;umed
her &s;eat;&mdash;the words died on her lips, and,
when &s;he looked wi$t fully towards the door
of the corridor, which was locked, &s;he con|&s;idered
it was impo&s;&s;ible for her to leave
the apartment, before Morano would be ap|pri&s;ed
of, and able to counteract, her inten|tion.</P>
<P>Without ob&s;erving her agitation, he con|tinued
to pace the room in the utmo&s;t per|turbation
of &s;pirits. His darkened counte|nance
expre&s;&s;ed all the rage of jealou&s;y and
revenge; and a per&s;on, who had &s;een his fer|tures
under the &s;mile of ineffable tenderne&s;s,
which he &s;o lately a&s;&s;umed, would now
&s;carcely have believed them to be the &s;ame.</P>
<P>&startq;Count Morano,&endq; &s;aid Emily, at length
recovering her voice, &startq;calm, I entreat you,
<PB N="273" REF="275">
the&s;e tran&s;ports, and li&s;ten to rea&s;on, if you
will not to pity. You have equally mif|placed
your love and your hatred.&mdash;I never
could have returned the affection, with which
you honour me, and certainly have never en|couraged
it; neither has Signor Montoni
injured you, for you mu&s;t have known, that
he had no right to di&s;po&s;e of my hand, had
he even po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the power to do &s;o. Leave,
then, leave the ca&s;tle, while you may with
&s;afety. Spare your&s;elf the dreadful con&s;e|quences
of an unju&s;t revenge, and the re|mor&s;e
of having prolonged to me the&s;e mo|ments
of &s;uffering.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Is it for mine, or for Montoni's &s;afety,
that you are thus alarmed?&endq; &s;aid Morano,
coldly, and turning towards her with a look
of acrimony.</P>
<P>&startq;For both,&endq; replied Emily, in a trem|bling
voice.</P>
<P>&startq;Unju&s;t revenge!&endq; cried the Count, re|&s;uming
the abrupt tones of pa&s;&s;ion. &startq;Who,
that looks upon that face, can imagine a puni&s;hment adequate to the injury he would
<PB N="274" REF="276">
have done me? Yes, I will leave the ca&s;tle;
but it &s;hall not be alone. I have trifled too
long. Since my prayers and my &s;ufferings
cannot prevail, force &s;hall. I have people in
waiting, who &s;hall convey you to my carriages.
Your voice will bring no fuccour; it can|not
be heard from this remote part of
the ca&s;tle; &s;ubmit, therefore, in &s;ilence to
go with me.&endq;</P>
<P>This was an unnece&s;&s;ary injunction, at
pre&s;ent; for Emily was too certain, that her
call would avail her nothing; and terror
had &s;o entirely di&s;ordered her thoughts, that
&s;he knew not how to plead to Morano, but &s;at,
mute and trembling, in her chair, till he ad|vanced
to lift her from it, when &s;he &s;uddenly
rai&s;ed her&s;elf, and, with a repul&s;ive ge&s;ture,
and a countenance of forced ferenity, &s;aid,
&startq;Count Morano! I am now in your power;
but you will ob&s;erve, that this is not the
conduct which can win the e&s;teem you ap|pear
&s;o &s;olicitous to obtain, and that you
are preparing for your&s;elf a load of remor&s;e,
in the mi&s;eries of a friendle&s;s orphan, which
<PB N="275" REF="277">
can never leave you. Do you believe your
heart to be, indeed, &s;o hardened, that you
can look without emotion on the &s;uffering,
to which you would condemn me?&endq;&mdash;</P>
<P>Emily was interrupted by the growling
of the dog, who now came again from the
bed, and Morano looked towards the door
of the &s;tair-ca&s;e, where no per&s;on appear|ing,
he called aloud, &startq;Ce&s;ario!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Emily,&endq; &s;aid the Count, &startq;why will
you reduce me to adopt this conduct? How
much more willingly would I per&s;uade,
than compel you to become my wife! but,
by Heaven! I will not leave you to be &s;old
by Montoni. Yet a thought glances acro&s;s
my mind, that brings madne&s;s with it. I
know not how to name it. It is prepo&s;terous
&mdash;it cannot be.&mdash;Yet you tremble&mdash;you
grow pale! It is! it is &s;o;&mdash;you&mdash;you&mdash;love
Montoni!&endq; cried Morano, gra&s;ping Emily's
wri&s;t, and &s;tamping his foot on the floor.</P>
<P>An involuntary air of &s;urpri&s;e appeared
on her countenance. &startq;If you have indeed
believed &s;o,&endq; &s;aid &s;he, &startq;believe &s;o &s;till.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="276" REF="278">
&startq;That look, tho&s;e words confirm it,&endq;
exclaimed Morano, furiou&s;ly. &startq;No, no,
no, Montoni had a richer prize in view,
than gold. But he &s;hall not live to tri|umph
over me!&mdash;This very in&s;tant&mdash;&endq;</P>
<P>He was interrupted by the loud barking
of the dog.</P>
<P>&startq;Stay, Count Morano,&endq; &s;aid Emily,
terrified by his words, and by the fury ex|pre&s;&s;ed
in his eyes, &startq;I will &s;ave you from
this error.&mdash;Of all man, Signor Montoni is
not your rival; though, if I find all other
mean of &s;aving my&s;elf vain, I will try
whether my voice may not arou&s;e his &s;er|vants
to my &s;uccour.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;A&s;&s;ertion,&endq; replied Morano, &startq;at &s;uch
a moment, is not to be depended upon.
How could I &s;uffer my&s;elf to doubt, even
for an in&s;tant, that he could &s;ee you, and
not love?&mdash;But my fir&s;t care &s;hall be to
convey you from the ca&s;tle. Ce&s;ario! ho,
&mdash;Ce&s;ario!&endq;</P>
<P>A man now appeared at the door of the
&s;tair-ca&s;e, and other &s;teps were heard a&s;cend|ing
<PB N="277" REF="279">
Emily uttered a loud &s;hriek, as Mo|rano
hurried her acro&s;s the chamber, and,
at the &s;ame moment, &s;he heard a noi&s;e at the
door, that opened upon the corridor. The
Count pau&s;ed an in&s;tant, as if his mind was
&s;u&s;pended between love and the de&s;ire of
vengeance; and, in that in&s;tant, the door
gave way, and Montoni, followed by the
old &s;teward and &s;everal other per&s;ons, bur&s;t
into the room.</P>
<P>&startq;Draw!&endq; cried Montoni to the Count,
who did not pau&s;e for a &s;econd bidding,
but, giving Emily into the hand of the
people, that appeared from the &s;tair-ca&s;e,
turned fiercely round. &startq;This in thine
heart, villain!&endq; &s;aid he, as he made a thru&s;t
at Montoni with his &s;word, who parried
the blow, and aimed another, while &s;ome of
the per&s;ons who had followed him into the
room, endeavoured to part the combatants,
and others re&s;cued Emily from the hands of
Morano's &s;ervants.</P>
<P>&startq;War it for this, Count Morano,&endq; &s;aid
<PB N="278" REF="280">
Montoni, in a cool &s;arca&s;tic tone of voice,
&startq;that I received you under my roof, and
permitted you, though my declared enemy,
to remain under it for the night? Was it,
that you might repay my ho&s;pitality with
the treachery of a fiend, and rob me of my
niece?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Who talks of treachery?&endq; &s;aid Mo|rano,
in a tone of unre&s;trained vehemence.
&startq;Let him that does, &s;hew an unblu&s;hing face
of innocence. Montoni, you are a villain!
If there is treachery in this affair, look to
your&s;elf as the author of it. <HI>If</HI>&mdash;do I &s;ay?
<HI>I</HI>&mdash;whom you have wronged with unexam|pled
ba&s;ene&s;s, whom you have injured al|mo&s;t
beyond redre&s;s! But why do I u&s;e
words?&mdash;Come on, coward, and receive
ju&s;tice at my hands!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Coward!&endq; cried Montoni, bur&s;ting from
the people who held him, and ru&s;hing on the
Count, when they both retreated into the
corridor, where the fight continued &s;o de&s;pe|rately,
that none of the &s;pectators dared ap|proach
<PB N="279" REF="281">
them, Montoni &s;wearing, that the
fir&s;t, who interfered, &s;hould fall by his
&s;word.</P>
<P>Jealou&s;y and revenge lent all their fury
to Morano, while the &s;uperior &s;kill and the
temperance of Montoni enabled him to
wound his adver&s;ary, whom his &s;ervants now
attempted to &s;eize, but he would not be re|&s;trained,
and, regardle&s;s of his would con|tinued
to fight. He &s;eemed to be in&s;en&s;ible
both of pain and lo&s;s of blood, and alive
only to the energy of his pa&s;&s;ions. Mon|toni,
on the contrary, per&s;evered in the com|bat,
with a fierce, yet wary, valour; he re|ceived
the pint of Morano's &s;word on his
arm but, almo't in the &s;ame in&s;tant, &s;e|verily
wounded and di&s;armed him. The
Count then fell back into the arms of his
&s;ervant, while Montoni held his &s;word over
him, and bade him a&s;k his like. Morano,
&s;inking under the angui&s;h of his wound,
had &s;carcely replied by a ge&s;ture, and by a
few words, feebly articulated, that he would
not&mdash;when he fainted; and Montoni was
<PB N="280" REF="282">
then going to have plunged the &s;word into
his brea&s;t, as he lay &s;en&s;ele&s;s, but his arm
was arre&s;ted by Cavigni. To the inter|ruption
he yielded without much difficulty,
but his complexion changed almo&s;t to
blakne&s;s, as he looked upon his fallen ad|ver&s;ary,
and ordered, that he &s;hould be car|ried
in&s;tantly from the cattle.</P>
<P>In the mean time, Emily, who had been
with-held from leaving the chamber during
the affray, now came forward into the cor|ridor,
and pleaded a cau&s;e of common hu|manity,
with the feelings of the warme&s;t
benevolence, when &s;he entreated Montoni
to allow Morano the a&s;&s;i&s;tance in the ca&s;tle,
which his &s;ituation required. But Mon|toni,
who had &s;eldom li&s;tened to pity, now
&s;eemed rapacious of vengeance, and, with a
mon&s;ter's cruelty, again ordered his defeated
enemy to be taken from the ca&s;tle, in $$s
pre&s;ent &s;tate, though there were only the
woods, or a &s;olitary neighbouring cottage,
to &s;helter him form the night.</P>
<P>The Count's &s;ervants having declared,
<PB N="281" REF="283">
that they would not move him till he re|vived,
Montoni's &s;tood inactive, Cavigni re|mon&s;trating,
and Emily, &s;uperior to Mon|toni's
menaces, giving water to Morano,
and directing the attendants to bind up his
wound. At length, Montoni had lei&s;ure to
feel pain form his own hurt, and he with|drew
to examine it.</P>
<P>The Count, meanwhile, having &s;lowly re|coverd,
the fir&s;t object he &s;aw, on rai&s;ing
his eyes, was Emily, bending over him
with a countenance &s;trongly expre&s;&s;ive of
&s;olicitude. He &s;urveyed her with a look of
angui&s;h.</P>
<P>&startq;I have de&s;erved this,&endq; &s;aid he, &startq;but not
form Montoni. It is from you, Emily,
that I have de&s;erved puni&s;hment, yet I re|ceive
only pity!&endq; He pau&s;ed, for the had
&s;poken with difficulty. After a moment,
he proceeded. &startq;I mu&s;t re&s;ign you, but
not to Montoni. Forgive me the &s;uf|ferings
I have already occa&s;ioned you! But
for <HI>that</HI> villain&mdash;his infamy &s;hall not go
unpuni&s;hed. Carry me from this place,&endq;
<PB N="282" REF="284">
&s;aid he to his &s;ervants. &startq;I am in no con|dition
to travel: you mu&s;t, therefore, take
me to the neare&s;t cottage, for I will not pa&s;s
the night under his roof, although I may
expire on the way from it.&endq;</P>
<P>Ce&s;ario propo&s;ed to go out, and enquire
for a cottage, that might receive his ma&s;ter,
before he attempted to remove him&endq; but Marano was impatient to be gone; the an|gui&s;h
of his mind &s;eemed to be ever greater
than that of his wound, and he rejected, with
di&s;dain, the offer of Cavigni to entreat
Montoni, that he might be &s;uffered to pa&s;s
the night in the ca&s;tle. Ce&s;ario was now
going to call up the carriage to the great
gate, but the Count forbade him. &startq;I can|not
bear the motion of a carriage,&endq; &s;aid he:
&startq;call &s;ome others of my people, that they
may a&s;&s;i&s;t in bearing me in their arms.&endq;</P>
<P>At length, however, Morano &s;ubmitted
to reason, and con&s;ented, that Ce&s;ario &s;hould
fir&s;t prepare &s;ome cottage to receive him.
Emily, now that he had recovered his
&s;en&s;es, was about to withdraw from the cor|ridor,
<PB N="283" REF="285">
when a me&s;&s;age from Montoni com|manded
her to do &s;o, and al&s;o that the
Count, if he was not already gone, &s;hould
quit the ca&s;tle immediately. Indignation
fla&s;hed from Morano's eyes, and flu&s;hed
his cheeks</P>
<P>&startq;Tell Montoni&endq; &s;aid he,&endq; that I &s;hall
go when it &s;uits my own convenience; that I quit the ca&s;tle, he dares to call his, as I
would the ne&s;t of a &s;erpeht, and that this is
not the la&s;t he &s;hall hear from me. Tell
him, I will not leave <HI>another</HI> murder on his
con&s;cience, if I can help it.&endq;</P>
<P>"Count Morano! do you know what
you &s;ay?&endq; &s;aid Cavigni.</P>
<P>&startq;Yes, Signor, I know well what I &s;ay,
and he will under&s;tand well what I mean.
His con&s;cience will a&s;&s;i&s;t his under&s;tanding,
on this occa&s;ion.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Count Morano,&endq; &s;aid Verezzi, who had
hitherto &s;ilently ob&s;erved him, &startq;dare again
to in&s;ult my friend, and I will plunge this
&s;word in your body.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;It would be an action worthy the friend
<PB N="284" REF="286">
of a villain!&endq; &s;aid Morano, as the &s;trong
impul&s;e of his indignation enabled his to
rai&s;e him&s;elf from the arms of his &s;ervants;
but the energy was momentary, and he &s;unk
back, exhau&s;ted by the effort. Montoni's
people, meanwhile, held Verezzi, who &s;eem|ed
inclined, even in this in&s;tant, to execute
his threat; and Cavigni, who was not &s;o de|praved
as to abet the cowardly malignity of
Verezzi, endeavoured to withdraw him
from the corridor; and Emily whom a
compa&s;&s;ionate intere&s;t had thus long de|tained,
was now quitting it in new terror,
when the &s;upplication voice of Morano ar|re&s;ted
her, and, by a feeble ge&s;ture, he beck|oned
her to draw nearer. She advanced
with timid &s;teps, but the fainting languor of
his countenance again awakened her pity,
and overcome her terror.</P>
<P>&startq;I am going from hence for ever&endq; &s;aid
he: &startq;perhaps, I &s;hall never &s;ee you again.
I would carry with me your forgivene&s;s,
Emily; nay more&mdash;I would al&s;o carry your
good wi&s;hes.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="285" REF="287">
&startq;You have my forgivene&s;s, then,&endq; &s;aid
Emily, &startq;and my &s;incere wi&s;hes for your
recovery.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;And only for my recovery?&endq; &s;aid Mo|rano,
with a &s;igh. &startq;For your general
welfare,&endq; added Emily.</P>
<P>&startq;Perhaps I ought to be contented with
this,&endq; he re&s;umed; &startq;I certainly have not
de&s;erved more; but I would a&s;k you, Emily,
&s;ometimes to think of me, and, forgetting
my offence, to remember only the pa&s;&s;ion
which occa&s;ioned it. I would a&s;k, alas!
impo&s;&s;ibilities: I would a&s;k you to love me!
At this moment, when I am about to part
with you, and that, perhaps, for ever, I am
&s;carcely my&s;elf. Emily&mdash;may you never
know the torture of a pa&s;&s;ion like mine!
What do I &s;ay? O, that, for me, you
might be &s;en&s;ible of &s;uch a pa&s;&s;ion!&endq;</P>
<P>Emily looked impatient to be gone. &startq;I
&startq;entreat you, Count, to con&s;ult your own
&s;afety,&endq; &s;aid &s;he, &startq;and linger here no longer.
I tremble for the con&s;equences of Signor Ve|rezzi's
pa&s;&s;ion, and of Montoni's re&s;entment,
&s;hould he learn that you are &s;till here.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="286" REF="288">
Morano's face was over&s;pread with a
momentary crim&s;on, his eyes &s;parkled, but
he &s;eemed endeavouring to conquer his emo|tion,
and replied in a calm voice, &startq;since
you are interested for my &s;fety, I will re|gard
it, and be gone. But, before I go,
let me again hear you &s;ay, that you wi&s;h me
well,&endq; faid he, fixing on her an earne&s;t and
mournful look.</P>
<P>Emily repeated her a&s;&s;urances. He took
her hand, which &s;he &s;carcely attempted to
withdraw, and put it to his lips. &startq;Fare|wel,
Count Morano!&endq; &s;aid Emily; and &s;he
turned to go, when a &s;econd me&s;&s;age arriv|ed
from Montoni, and &s;he again conjured
Morano, as he valued his life, to quit the
ca&s;tle immediately. He regarded her in
&s;ilence, with a look of fixed de&s;pair. But
&s;he had no time to enforce her compa&s;|&s;ionate
entreaties, and, not daring to di&s;|obey
the &s;econd command of Montoni, &s;he
left the corridor, to attend him.</P>
<P>He was in the cedar parlour, that ad|joined
the great hall, laid upon a couch,
<PB N="287" REF="289">
and &s;uffering a degree of angui&s;h form his
wound, which few per&s;ons could have di&s;|gui&s;ed,
as he did. His countenance, which
was &s;tern, but calm, expre&s;&s;ed the dark pa&s;|&s;ion
of revenge, but no &s;ymptom of pain;
bodily pain, indeed, he had always de&s;pi&s;ed,
and had yielded only to the &s;trong and
terrible energies of the &s;oul. He was at|tended
by old Carlo and by Signor Berto|lini,
by Madame Montoni was not with him.</P>
<P>Emily trembled, as &s;he approached and
received his &s;evers rebuke, for not having
obeyed his fir&s;t &s;ummons; and perceived,
al&s;o, that he attributed her &s;tay in the cor|ridor
to a motive, that had not even occur|red
to her artle&s;s mind.</P>
<P>&startq;This is an in&s;tance of female caprice,&endq;
&s;aid he, &startq;which I ought to have fore&s;een.
Count Morano, who&s;e &s;uit you ob&s;tinately
rejected, &s;o long as it was countenanced by
me, you favour, it &s;eems, &s;ince you find I
have di&s;mi&s;&s;ed him.&endq;</P>
<P>Emily looked a&s;toni&s;hed. &startq;I do not
<PB N="288" REF="290">
comprehend you, &s;ir,&endq; &s;aid &s;he: &startq;You cer|tainly
do not mean to imply, that the de|&s;ign

mine.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;To that I reply nothing,&endq; &s;aid Mon|toni;
&startq;but it mu&s;t certainly be a more
than common intere&s;t, that made you plead
&s;o warmly in his cau&s;e, and that could de|tain
you thus long in his pre&s;ence, contrary
to my expre&s;s order&mdash;in the pre&s;ence of a

<P>&startq;I fear,&s;ir, it was a more than common
intere&s;t, that detained me,&endq; &s;aid Emily
calmly; &startq;for of late I have been inclined
to think, that of compa&s;&s;ion is an uncom|mon
one. But how could I, could <HI>you,</HI> &s;ir,
witne&s;s Count Morano's deplorable con|dition,
and not wi&s;h to relieve it?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;You add hypocri&s;y to caprice,&endq; &s;aid

<PB N="289" REF="291">
you &s;hould learn and practi&s;e the virtues,
which are indi&s;pen&s;able to a woman&mdash;&s;incerity,
uniformity of conduct and obe|dience.&endq;</P>
<P>Emily, who had always endeavoured to
regulate her conduct by the nice&s;t laws, and
who&s;e mind was finely &s;en&s;ible, not only of
what is ju&s;t in morals, but of whatever is
beautiful in the female character, was
&s;hocked by the&s;e words; yet, in the next
moment, her heart &s;welled with the con|&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s
of having de&s;erved prai&s;e, in|&s;tead
of cen&s;ure, and &s;he was proudly &s;ilent.
Montoni, acquainted with the delicacy of
her mind, knew how keenly &s;he would feel
his rebuke; but he was a &s;tranger to the
luxury of con&s;cious worth, and, therefore,
did not fore&s;ee the energy of that &s;entiment,
which now repelled his &s;atire. Turning to
a &s;ervant who had lately entered the room,
he a&s;ked whether Morano had quitted the
ca&s;tle. The man an&s;wered, that his &s;er|vants
were then removing him, on a couch,
to a neighbouring cottage. Montoni &s;eem|ed
<PB N="290" REF="292">
&s;omewhat appea&s;ed, on hearing this;
and, when Ludovico appeared, a few mo|ments
after,and &s;aid, that Morano was
gone, he told Emily &s;he might retire to
her apartment.</P>
<P>She withdrew willingly from his pre|&s;ence;
but the thought of pa&s;&s;ing the re|mainder
of the night in a chamber, which
the door from the &s;tair-ca&s;e made liable to
the intru&s;ion of any per&s;on, now alarmed
her more than ever, and &s;he determined to
call at Madam Montoni's room, and re|que&s;t,
that Annette might be permitted to
be with her.</P>
<P>On reaching the great gallery, &s;he heard
voices &s;eemingly in di&s;pute, and, her &s;pirits
now apt to take alarm, &s;he pau&s;ed, but
&s;oon di&s;tingui&s;hed &s;ome words of Cavigni
and Verezzi, and went towards them, in
the hope of conciliating their difference.
They were alone. Verezzi's face was &s;till
flu&s;hed with rage; and, as the fir&s;t object of
it was now removed from him, he appear|ed
willing to transfer his re&s;entment to Ca|vigni,
<PB N="291" REF="293">
who &s;eemed to be expo&s;tulating,
rather than di&s;puting, with him.</P>
<P>Verezzi was prote&s;ting, that he would
in&s;tantly inform Montoni of the in&s;ult,
which Morano had thrown out again&s;t him,
and above all, that, wherein he had accu&s;ed
him of murder.</P>
<P>&startq;There is no an&s;wering,&endq; &s;aid Cavigni,
&startq;for the words of a man in a pa&s;&s;ion; lit|tle
&s;erious regard ought to be paid to them.
If you per&s;i&s;t in your re&s;olution, the con|&s;equences
may be fatal to both. We have
now more &s;erious intere&s;ts to pur&s;ue, than
tho&s;e of a petty revenge.&endq;</P>
<P>Emily joined her entreaties to Cavigni's
arguments, and they, at length, prevailed
&s;o far, as that Verezzi con&s;ented to retire,
without &s;eeing Montoni.</P>
<P>On calling at her aunt's apartment, &s;he
found it fa&s;tened. In a few minutes, how|ever,
it was opened by Madame Montoni
her&s;elf.</P>
<P>It may be remembered, that it was by a
door leading into the bed-room from a
<PB N="292" REF="294">
back pa&s;&s;age, that Emily had &s;ecretly en|tered
a few hours preceding. She now
conjectured, by the calmne&s;s of Madame
Montoni's air, that &s;he was not appri&s;ed of
the accident, which had befallen her hu&s;band,
and was beginning to inform her of
it, in the tendere&s;t manner &s;he could, when
her aunt interrupted her, by &s;aying, &s;he was
acquainted with the whole affair.</P>
<P>Emily knew indeed, that &s;he had little
rea&s;on to love Montoni, but could &s;carcely
have believed her capable of &s;uch perfect
apathy, as &s;he now di&s;covered towards him;
having obtained permi&s;&s;ion, however, for
Annette to &s;leep ni her chamber, &s;he went
thither immediately.</P>
<P>A track of blood appeared along the
corridor, leading to it; and on the &s;pot,
where the Count and Montoni had fought,
the whole flor was &s;tained. Emily &s;hud|dered,
and leaned on Annette, as &s;he pa&s;&s;|ed.
When &s;he reached her apartment, &s;he
in&s;tantly determined, &s;ince the door of the
&s;tair-ca&s;e had been left open, and that An|nette
<PB N="293" REF="295">
was now with her, to explore whither
it led,&mdash;a circum&s;tance now materially con|nected
with her won &s;afety. Annette ac|cordingly,
half curious and half afraid,
propo&s;ed to de&s;cend the &s;tairs; but, on ap|proaching
the door, they perceived, that it
was already fa&s;tened without, and their care
was then directed to the &s;ecuring it on the
in&s;ide al&s;o, by placing again&s;t it as much
of the heavy furniture of the room, as they
could lift. Emily then retired to bed, and
Annette continued on a chair by the hearth,
where &s;ome feeble embers remained.</P>

<P>It is now nece&s;&s;ary to mention &s;ome cir|cum&s;tance,
which could not be related
amid&s;t the events of Emily's ha&s;ty departure
from Venice, or toghether with tho&s;e which
&s;o rapidly &s;ucceeded to her arrival in the
ca&s;tle.</P>
<P>On the morning of her journey, Count
Morano had gone at the appointed hour to
the man&s;ion of Montoni, to demand his
bride. When he reached it, he was &s;ome|what
&s;urpri&s;ed by the &s;ilenc and &s;olitary
air of the portico, where Montoni's lacqueys
u&s;ually loitered; but &s;urpri&s;e was &s;oon
changed to a&s;toni&s;hment, and a&s;toni&s;hment
to the rage of di&s;appointment, when the
door was opened by an old woman, who
told his &s;ervants, that her ma&s;ter and his
<PB N="295" REF="297">
family had left Venice, early in the morning,
for <HI>Terra-firma.</HI> Scarcely believing what
his &s;ercvant told, he left his gondola, and
ru&s;hed into the hall to enquire further. The
old woman, who was the only per&s;on left in
care of the man&s;ion, per&s;i&s;ted in her &s;tory,
which the &s;ilent and de&s;erted apartments
&s;oon convinced him was no fiction. He
then &s;eized her with a menacing air, as if he
meant to wreak all his vengeance upon her,
at the &s;ame time a&s;king her twenty que&s;tions
in a breath, and all the&s;e with a ge&s;ticula|tion
&s;o furious, that &s;he was deprived of the
power of an&s;wering them; then &s;uddenly
letting her go, her &s;tamped about the hall,
like a madman, cur&s;ing Montoni and his
own folly.</P>
<P>When the good woman was at liberty;
and had &s;omewhat recovered from her fright,
&s;he told him all &s;he knew of the affair, which
was, indeed, very little, but enough to en|able
Morano to di&s;cover, that Montoni was
gone to his ca&s;tle on the Apennine. Thither
he followed, as &s;oon as his &s;ervants could
<PB N="296" REF="298">
complete the nece&s;&s;ary preparation for the
journey, accompanied by a friend, and at|tended
by a number his people, deter|mined
to obtain Emily, or a full revenge
on Montoni. When his mind had reco|vered
from the fir&s;t efferve&s;cence of rage,
and his thoughts became le&s;s ob&s;cured, his
con&s;cience hinted to him certain circum|&s;tances,
which, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, explained
the conduct of Montoni: but how the latter
could have been led to &s;u&s;pect an inten|tion,
which, he had believed, was known only
to him&s;elf, he could not even gue&s;s. On
this occa&s;ion, however, he had been partly
betrayed by that &s;ympathetic intelligence,
which may be &s;aid to exi&s;t between bad minds,
and which reaches one man to judge what
another will do in the &s;ame circum&s;tances.
Thus it was with Montoni, who had now
received indi&s;putable proof of a truth, which
he had &s;ome time &s;u&s;pected&mdash;that Morano's
circum&s;tances, in&s;tead of being affluent, as
he had been bidden to believe, were greatly in|volved.
Montoni had been intere&s;ted in his
<PB N="297" REF="299">
fuit, by motives entirely &s;elfi&s;s, tho&s;e of ava|rice
and pride; the la&s;t of which would
have been gratified by an alliance with a
Venetian noblemen, the former by Emily's
e&s;tate in Ga&s;$ony, which he had &s;tipulated,
as the price of his favour, &s;hould be de|livered
up to him from the day of her
marriage. In the mean time, he had been
led to &s;u&s;pect the con&s;equence of the Count's
boundle&s;s extravagance; but it was not till
the evening, preceding the intended nuptials,
that he obtained certain information of his
di&s;tre&s;&s;ed circum&s;tances. He did not he&s;i|tate
then to infer, that Morano de&s;igned to
defraud him of Emily's e&s;tate; and in this
&s;uppo&s;ition he was confirmed, and with ap|parent
rea&s;on, by the &s;ub&s;equent conduct of
the Count, who, after having appointed to
meet him on that night, for the purpo&s;e of
&s;igning the in&s;trument, which was to &s;ecure
to him his reward, failed in his engagement.
Such a circum&s;tance, indeed, in a man of
Morano's gay and thoghtle&s;s character, and
at a time when his mind was engaged by
<PB N="298" REF="300">
the bu&s;tle of preparation for his nuptials,
might have been attributed to a cau&s;e le&s;s
deci&s;ive, than de&s;ign; but Montoni did not
he&s;itate an in&s;tant to interpret it his own way,
and, after vainly waiting the Count's arrival,
for &s;everal hours, he gave orders for his
people to be in readine&s;s to &s;et off at a mo|ment's
notice. By ha&s;tening to Udolpho
he intended to remove Emily from the
reach of Morano, as well as to break off
the affair, without &s;ubmitting him&s;elf to u&s;e|le&s;s
altercation: and, if the Count meant what
he called honourably, he would doubtle&s;s
follow Emily, and &s;ign the writings in que&s;|tion.
If this was done, &s;o little con&s;idera|tion
had Montoni for her welfare, that he
would not have &s;crupled to &s;acrifice her to
a man of ruined fortune, &s;ince by that means
he could enrich hime&s;elf; asnd he forbore to
mention to her the motive of his &s;udden
journey, left the hope it might revive &s;hould
render her more intractable, when &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion
would be required.</P>
<P>With the &s;e con&s;iderations, he had left Ve|nice;
<PB N="299" REF="301">
and, with others totally different, Mo|rano
had, &s;oon after, pur&s;ued his &s;teps acro&s;s
the rugged Apennines. When his arrival
was announced at the ca&s;tle, Montoni did
not believe, that he would have pre&s;umed
to &s;hew him&s;elf, unle&s;s he had meant to fulfil
his engagement, and he, therefore, readily
admitted him; but the enraged countenarice
and expre&s;&s;ions of Morano, as he entered
the apartment, in&s;tantly undeceived him;
and, when Montoni had explained, in part,
the motives of his abrupt departure from
Venice, the Count &s;till per&s;i&s;ted in demand|ing
Emily, and reproaching Montoni, with|out
even naming the former &s;tipulation.</P>
<P>Montoni, at length, weary of the di&s;pute,
deferred the &s;ettling of it till the morrow,
and Morano retired with &s;ome hope, &s;ug|ge&s;ted
by Montoni's apparent indeci&s;ion.
When, however, in the &s;ilence of his own
apartment, he began to con&s;ider the pa&s;t
conver&s;ation, the character of Montoni, and
&s;ome former in&s;tances of his duplicity, the
hope, which he had admitted, vani&s;hed, and
<PB N="300" REF="302">
he determined not to neglect the pre&s;ent po&s;|&s;ibility
of obtaining Emily by other means.
To his confidential valet he told his de&s;ign
of carrying away Emily, and &s;ent him back
to Montoni's &s;ervants to find out one among
$hem, who might enable him to execute it.
The choice of this per&s;on he entru&s;ted to
the fellow's own di&s;cernment, and not im|prudently;
for he di&s;covered a man, whom
Montoni had, on &s;ome former occa&s;ion,
treated har&s;hly, and who was now ready to
betray him. This man conducted ce&s;ario
round the ca&s;tle, through a private pa&s;&s;age,
to the &s;tair-ca&s;se, that led to Emily's cham|ber;
then &s;hewed him a &s;short way out of
the building, and af$erwards procured him
the keys, that would &s;ecure his retreat. The
man was well rewarded for his trouble; how
the Count was rewarded for his treachery,
has already appeared.</P>
<P>Meanwhile, old Carlo had overheard two
of Morano's &s;ervants, who had been ordered
to be in waiting with the carriage, beyond the
ca&s;tle walls, expre&s;&s;ing their &s;urpri&s;e at their
<PB N="301" REF="303">
ma&s;ter's &s;udden, and &s;ecrer departure, for the
valet had entru&s;ted them with no more of Mo|rano's
de&s;igns, than it was nece&s;&s;ary for them
to execute. They, however, indulged them|&s;elves
in &s;urmi&s;es, and in expre&s;&s;ing them to
each other; and from the&s;e Carlo had drawn a
ju&s;t conclu&s;ion. But, before he ventured to
di&s;clo&s;e his apprehen&s;ions to Montoni, he en|deavoured
to obtain further confirmation of
them, and, for this purpo&s;e, placed him&s;elf,
with one of his fellow &s;ervants, at the door
of Emily's apartment, that opened upon the
corridor. He did not watch long in vain,
though the growling of the dog had once
nearly betrayed him. When he was con|vinced,
that Morano was in the room, and
had li&s;tened long enough to his conver&s;ation,
to under&s;tand his &s;cheme, he immediately
alarmed Montoni, and thus re&s;cued Emily
from the de&s;igns of the count.</P>
<P>Montoni, on the following morning, ap|peared
as u&s;ual, except that he wore his
wounded arm in a &s;ting; he went out upon
the ramparts; overlooked the men employed
<PB N="302" REF="304">
in rep$ring them; gave orders for additional
workmen, and then came into the ca&s;tle to
give audience to &s;everal per&s;ons, who were
ju&s;t arrived, and who were &s;hewen into a pri|vate
apartment, where he communicated
with them, for near an hour. Carlo was then
&s;ummoned, and ordered to conduct the
&s;trangers to a part of the ca&s;tle, which, in
former times, had been occupied by the up|per
&s;ervants of the family, and to provide
them with every nece&s;&s;ary refre&s;hment.&mdash;
When he had done this, he was bidden to
return to his ma&s;ster.</P>
<P>Meanwhile, the Count remained in a cot|tage
in the &s;kirts of the woods below, &s;uffer|ing
under bodily and mental pain, and me|ditating
deep revenge again&s;t Montoni. His
&s;ervant, whom he had di&s;patched for a &s;urgeon
to the neare&s;t town, which was however, at
a con&s;iderable di&s;tance, did not return till
the following day, when, his wounds being
examined and dre&s;&s;ed, the plractitioner re|fu&s;ed
to deliver any po&s;itive opinion, con|cerning
the degree of danger attending them;
<PB N="303" REF="305">
but, giving his patient a compo&s;ing draught
and ordering him to be kept quiet, remained
at the cottage to watch the event.</P>
<P>Emily, for the remainder of the late
eventful night, had been &s;uffered to &s;leep,
undi&s;turbed; and, when her mind recovered
from the confu&s;ion of &s;lumber, and &s;he re|membered,
that &s;he was now relea&s;ed from
the addre&s;&s;es of Count Morano, her &s;pirits
were &s;uddenly relieved from a part of the
terrible anxiety, that had long oppre&s;&s;ed
them; that which remained, aro&s;e chief$y
from a recollection of Morano's a&s;&s;ertions,
concerning the &s;chemes of Montoni. He
had &s;aid, that plans of the latter, concerning
Emily, were in&s;earchable, yet that he knew
them to be terible. At the time he uttered
this, &s;he almo&s;t believed it to be designed
for the purpo&s;e of prevailing with her to
throw her&s;elf into his protection, and &s;he
&s;till thought it might be chiefly &s;o ac|counted
for; but his a&s;&s;ertions had left an
impre&s;&s;ion on her mind, which a con&s;dera|tion
<PB N="304" REF="306">
of the character and former conduct of
Montoni did not contribute to efface. She,
however, checked her propen&s;ity to antici|pate
evil; and, determined to enjoy this
re&s;pite from actual misfortune, tried to di&s;|mi&s;s
thought, took her in&s;truments for draw|ing,
and placed her&s;elf at a window, to &s;elect
into a land&s;cape &s;ome features of the &s;cenery
without.</P>
<P>As &s;he was thus employed, &s;he &s;aw, walk|ing
on the rampart below, the men, who
had &s;o lately arrived at the castle. The
&s;ight of &s;trangers &s;urpri&s;ed her, but &s;till
more, of &s;trangers &s;uch as the&s;e. There was
a &s;ingularity in their dre&s;s, and a certain
fiercene&s;s in their air, that fixed all her at|tention.
She withdrew from the ca&s;ement,
while they pa&s;&s;ed, but &s;oon returned to ob|&s;erve
them further. Their fugures &s;eemed
&s;o well &s;uited to the wildne&s;s of the &s;ur|rounding
objects, that, as they &s;tood &s;urvey|ing
the ca&s;tle, &s;he &s;ketched them for ban|ditti,
amid the mountain-view of her picture,
<PB N="305" REF="307">
when &s;the had fini&s;hed which, &s;he was &s;ur|pri&s;ed
to ob&s;erve the &s;pirit of her group.
But &s;he had copied from nature.</P>
<P>Carlo, when he had placed refre&s;hment be|fore
the&s;e men in the apartment a&s;&s;igned to
them, returened, as he was ordered, to Mon|toni,
who was anxious to di&s;cover by what
&s;ervant the keys of the ca&s;tle had been de|livered
to Morano, on the preceding night.
But this man, though he was too faithful to
his ma&s;ter quietly to &s;ee him injured, would
not betray a fellow-&s;ervant even to ju&s;tice;
he, therefore, pretended to be ignorant who
it was, that had con&s;pired with Count Mo|rano,
and related, as before, that he had only
overheard &s;ome of the &s;trangers de&s;cribing
the plot.</P>
<P>Montoni's &s;u&s;picions naturally fell upon
the porter, whom he ordered now to attend.
Carlo he&s;itated, and then with &s;low &s;teps
went to &s;eek him.</P>
<P>Barnardine, the porter, denied the accu|&s;ation
with a counteanance to &s;teady and un|daunted,
that Montoni could &s;carcely be|lieve
<PB N="306" REF="308">
him guilty, though he knew not how
to think him innocent. At lenght, the man
was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from his pre&s;ence, and,
though the real offender, e&s;caped detection.</P>
<P>Montoni then went to his wife's apart|ment,
whither Emily followed &s;oon after,
but, finding them in high di&s;pute, was in|&s;tantly
leaving the room, when her aunt
called her back, and de&s;ired her to &s;tay.&mdash;
&startq;You &s;hall be a witne&s;s,&endq; &s;aid &s;he,&endq; of my
oppo&s;tion. Now, &s;ir, repeat the command,
I have &s;o often refu&s;ed to obey.&endq;</P>
<P>Montoni turned, with a &s;tern countenance,
to Emily, and bade her quit the apartment,
while his wife per&s;i&s;ted in de&s;iring, that &s;he
would &s;taly. Emily was eager to e&s;cape
from this &s;cene of contention, and anxious,
al&s;o, to &s;erve her aunt, but &s;he de&s;paired of
conciliating Montoni, in who&s;e eyes the ri|&s;ing
mpe&s;t of his &s;oul fla&s;hed terribly.</P>
<P>"Leave the room,&endq; &s;aid he, in a voice of
thunder. Emily obeyed, and, walking
down to the rampart, which the &s;trangers
had now le&s;t, continued to meditate on the
<PB N="307" REF="309">
unhappy marriage of her father's &s;i&s;ter, and
on her own de&s;olate &s;ituation, occa&s;ioned
by the ridiculous imprudence of her, whom
&s;he had always wi&s;hed to re&s;pect and love.
Madame Montoni's conduct had, indeed,
rendered in impo&s;&s;ible for Emily to do ei|ther;
but her gently heart was touched by
her di&s;tre&s;s, and, in the pity thus awakened,
&s;he forgot the injurious treatment &s;he had
received from her.</P>
<P>As &s;he &s;auntered on the rampart, Annette
appeared at the hall door, looked cautiou&s;ly
round, and then advanced to meet her.</P>
<P>&startq;Dear m'am&s;elle, I have been looking
for you all over the caftle,&endq; &s;aid &s;he. &startq;If
you will &s;tep this way, I will &s;hew you a
picture.;</P>
<P>&startq;A picture!&endq; exclaimed Emily, and
&s;huddered.</P>
<P>&startq;Yes, ma'am, a picture of the late lady
of this place. Old Carlo Ju&s;t now told me
it was her, and I thought you would be
curious to &s;ee it. As to my lady, you
know, ma'am&s;elle, one cannot talk about
&s;uch things to her.&endq;&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="308" REF="310">
&startq;And &s;o,&endq; &s;aid Emily &s;milingly, &startq;as
you mu&s;t talk of them to &s;omebody&mdash;&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Why, yes, ma'am&s;elle; what can one
do in &s;uch a place as this, if one mu&s;t not
talk? If I was in a dungeon, if they would
let me talk&mdash;it would be &s;ome comfort;
nay, I would talk, if it was only to the
walls. But come, ma'am&s;elle, we lo&s;e
time&mdash;let me &s;hew you to the picture.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Is it veiled?&endq; &s;aid Emily, pau&s;ing.</P>
<P>&startq;Dear ma'am&s;elle!&endq; &s;aid Annette, fix|ing
her eyes on Emily's face, &startq;what makes
you look &s;o pale?&mdash;are you ill?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;No, Annette, I am well enough, but I
have no de&s;ire to &s;ee this picutre; return
into the hall.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;What! ma'am, not to &s;ee the lady of
this ca&s;tle?&endq; &s;aid the girl&mdash;&startq;the lady, who
di&s;appeared &s;o &s;trangely? Well! now, I
would have run to the furthe&s;t mountain
we can &s;ee, yonder, to have got a &s;ight of
&s;uch a picture; and, to &s;peak my mind, that
&s;trange &s;tory is all, that makes me care about
this old ca&s;tle, though it makes me thrill all
over, as it were, whenever I think of it.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="309" REF="311">
&startq;Yes, Annette, you love the wonderful;
but do you know, that, unle&s;sw you guard
again&s;t this inclination, it will lead you into
all the mi&s;ery of &s;uper&s;tition?&endq;</P>
<P>Annette might have &s;miled in her turn, at
this &s;age ob&s;ervation of Emily, who could
tremble with ideal terrors, as much as her|&s;elf,
and li&s;ten almo&s;t as eagerly to the re|cital
of a my&s;terious &s;tory. Annette urged
her reque&s;t.</P>
<P>&startq;Are you &s;ure it is a picture?&endq; &s;aid
Emily, &startq;Have you &s;een it?&mdash;Is it veiled?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Holy Maria! ma'am&s;elle, yes, no, yes.
I am &s;ure it is a picture&mdash;I have &s;een it,
and it is not veiled!&endq;</P>
<P>The tone and look of &s;urpri&s;e, with which
this was uttered, recalled Emily's prudence;
who concealed her emotion under a &s;mile;
and bade Annette lead her to the picture.
It was in an ob&s;cure chamber, adjoining
that part of the ca&s;tle, allotted to the &s;er|vants.
Several other portraits hung on the
walls, covered, like this, with du&s;t and
cobweb.</P>
<P><PB N="310" REF="312">
&startq;That is it, ma'am&s;elle,&endq; &s;aid Annette,
in a low voice, and pointing. Emily ad|vanced,
and &s;urveyed the picture. It re|pre&s;ented
a lady in teh flower of youth and
beauty; her features were hand&s;ome and
noble, full of &s;trong expre&s;&s;ion, but had
little of the captivating &s;weetne&s;s, that
Emily had looked for, and &s;till le&s;s of the
pen&s;ive mildne&s;s &s;he loved. It was a coun|tenance,
which &s;poke the language of pa&s;|&s;ion,
rather than that of &s;entiment; a
haughty impatience of misfortune&mdash;not the
placid melancholy of a &s;pirit injured, yet re&s;igned.</P>
<P>&startq;How many years have pa&s;&s;ed, &s;ince this
lady di&s;appeared, Annette?&endq; &s;aid Emily.</P>
<P>&startq;Twenty years, ma'am&s;elle, or there|about,
as they tell me; I know it is a long
while ago.&endq; Emily continued to gaze upon the portrait.</P>
<P>&startq;I think,&endq; re&s;umed Annette, &startq;the Signor
would do well to hang it in a better place,
than this old chamber. Now, in my mind,
he ought to place the picture of a lady, who
<PB N="311" REF="313">
gave him all the&s;e riches, in the hand&s;ome&s;t
room in the ca&s;tle. But he may have good
rea&s;ons for what he does: and &s;ome peo|ple
do &s;ay, that he has lo&s;t his riches, as
well as his gratitude. But hu&s;h, ma'am,
not a word!&endq; added Annette, laying her
finger on her lips. Emily was too much
ab&s;orbed in thought, to hear what &s;he &s;aid.</P>
<P>&startq;'T is a hand&s;ome lady, I am &s;ure,&endq; con|tinued
Annette: &startq;the Signor need not be
a&s;hamed to put her in the great apartment,
where the veiled picutre hangs.&endq; Emily
turned round. &startq;But for that matter, &s;he
would be as little &s;een there, as here, for
the door is always locked, I find.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Let us leave this chamber,&endq; &s;aid
Emily: &startq;and let me caution you again,
Annett#eA; be guarded in your conver&s;ation,
and never tell, that you know any thing of
that picture.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Holy mother!,, exclaimed Annette,
&startq;it is no &s;ecret; why all the &s;ervants have
&s;een it already!&endq;</P>
<P>Emily &s;tarted. &startq;How is this?&endq; &s;aid
&s;the&mdash;&startq;Have &s;een it! When?&mdash;how?&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="312" REF="314">
&startq;Dear, ma'am&s;elle, there is nothing &s;ur|pri&s;ing
in that: we had all a little more <HI>cu|rivn&s;ne&s;s</HI>
than you had.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I thought you told me, the door was
kept locked?&endq; &s;aid Emily.</P>
<P>&startq;If that was the ca&s;e, ma'am&s;elle,&endq; re|plied
Annette, looking about her, &startq;how
could we get here?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;O! you mean <HI>this</HI> picture,&endq; &s;aid Emily,
with returning calmne&s;s. &startq;Well, Annette,
here is nothing more to engage my atten|tion;
we will go.&endq;</P>
<P>Emily, as &s;he pa&s;&s;ed to her own apart|ment,
&s;aw Montoni go down to the hall,
and &s;he turned into her aunt's dre&s;&s;ing|room,
whom &s;he found weeping and alone,
grief and re&s;entment &s;truggling on her
countenance. Pride had hitherto re&s;trained
complaint. Judging of Emily's di&s;po&s;ition
from her own, and from a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s
of what her treatment of her de&s;erved, &s;he
had believed, that her griefs would be cau&s;e
of triumph to $er niece, rather than of
&s;ympathy; that &s;he would de&s;pi&s;e, not pity
<PB N="313" REF="315">
her. But the knew not knew not the tenderne&s;s and
benevolence of Emily's heart, that had al|ways
taught her to forget her own injuries
in the misfortunes of her enemy. The &s;uf|ferings
of others, whoever they might be,
called forth her ready compa&s;&s;ion, which
di&s;&s;ipated at once every ob&s;curing cloud to
goodne&s;s, that pa&s;&s;ion or prejudice might
have rai&s;ed in her mind.</P>
<P>Madame Montoni's &s;ufferings, at length,
ro&s;e above her pride, and, when Emily had
before entered the room, &s;he would have
told them all, had not her hu&s;band prevented
her; now that &s;he was no longer re&s;trained
by his pre&s;ence, &s;he poured forth all her
complaints to her niece.</P>
<P>&startq;O Emily!&endq; &s;he exclaimed, &startq;I am the
m$&s;t wretched of women&mdash;I am indeed
cruelly treated! Who, with my pro&s;pects
of happine&s;s, could have fore&s;een $$ch a
wretched fate as this?&mdash;who could have
thought, when I married &s;uch a man as the
Signor, I &s;hould ever have to bewail my lot?
But there is no judging what is for the
<PB N="314" REF="316">
be&s;t&mdash;there is no knowing what is for our
good! The mo&s;t flattering pro&s;pects often
change&mdash;the be&s;t judgments may be de|ceived
&mdash;who could have fore&s;een, when I
married the Signor, that I &s;hould ever re|pent
my <HI>genero&s;ity?&endq;</HI></P>
<P>Emily thought &s;he might have fore&s;een
it, but this was not a thought of triumph.
She placed her&s;elf in a chair near her aunt,
took her hand, and, with one of tho&s;e looks
of &s;ost compa&s;&s;ion, which might characterize
the countenance of a guardian angel, &s;poke
to her in the tendere&s;t accents. But the&s;e
did not &s;ooth Madame Montoni, whom im|patience
to talk made unwilling to li&s;ten.
She wanted to complain, not to be con&s;oled;
and it was by exclamations of complaint
only, that Emily learned the particular cir|cum&s;tances
of her affliction.</P>
<P>&startq;Ungrateful man!&endq; &s;aid Madame Mon|toni,
&startq;he has deceived me in every re&s;pect;
and now he has taken me from my country
and friends, to &s;hut me up in this old ca&s;tle;
and, here he thinks he can compel me to
<PB N="315" REF="317">
do whatever he de&s;igns! But he &s;hall find
him&s;elf mi&s;taken, he &s;hall find that no
threats can alter&mdash;But who would have
believed! who would have &s;uppo&s;ed, that a
man of his family and apparent wealth had
ab&s;olutely no fortune?&mdash;no, &s;carcely a &s;e|quin
of his own! I did all for the be&s;t; I
thought he was a man of con&s;equence, of
great property, or I am &s;ure I would never
have married him,&mdash;ungrateful, artful man!&endq;
She pau&s;ed to take breath.</P>
<P>&startq;Dear Madam, be compo&s;ed,&endq; &s;aid
Emily: &startq;the Signor may not be &s;o rich as
you had rea&s;on to expect, but &s;urely he
cannot be very poor, &s;ince this ca&s;tle and
the man&s;ion at Venice are his. May I a&s;k
what are the circum&s;tances, that particu|larly
affect you?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;What are the ciruc&s;tances!&endq; exclaim|ed
Madame Montoni with re&s;entment:
&startq;Why is it not &s;ufficient, that he had
long ago ruined his own fortune by play,
and that he has &s;ince lo&s;t what I brought
him&mdash;and that now he would compel me
<PB N="316" REF="318">
to &s;ign away my &s;ettlement (it was well I
had the chief of my property &s;ettled on my|felf!&#62;
that he may lo&s;e this al&s;o, or throw
it away in wild &s;chemes, which nobody can
under&s;tand but him&s;elf? And, and&mdash;is
not all this &s;ufficient?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;It is, indeed,&endq; &s;aid Emily, &startq;but you
mu&s;t recollect, dear madam, that I knew
nothing of all this.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Well, and is it not &s;ufficient,&endq; rejoined
her aunt, &startq;that he is al&s;o ab$olutely ruin|ed,
thathe is &s;unk deeply in debt, and that
neither this ca&s;tle, or the man&s;ion at Venice,
is his own, if all his debts, honourable
and di&s;honourable, were paid!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I am &s;hocked by what you tell me,
madam,&endq; &s;aid Emily.</P>
<P>&startq;And is it not enough,&endq; interrupted
Madame Montoni, &startq;that he has treated me
with neglect, with cruelty, becau&s;e I re|fu&s;ed
to relinqui&s;h my &s;ettlements, and, in|&s;tead
of being frightened by his menaces,
re&s;olutely defied him, and upbraided him
with his &s;hameful conduct? But $ bore
<PB N="317" REF="319">
all meekly,&mdash;you know, niece, I never ut|tered
a word of complaint, till now; no!
That &s;uch a di&s;po&s;ition as mine &s;hould be &s;o
impo&s;ed upon! That I, who&s;e only faul$s are
too much kindne&s;s, too much genero&s;ity,
&s;hould be chained for$ life to &s;uch a vile,
deceitful, cruel mon&s;ter!&endq;</P>
<P>Want of breath compelled Madame
Montoni to &s;top. If any thing could have
made Emily &s;mile in the&s;e moments, it
would have been this &s;peech of her aunt,
delivered in a voice very little below a
&s;cream;and with a vehemence of ge&s;ticula|tion
and of countenance, that turned the
whole into burle&s;que. Emily &s;aw, that
her misfortunes did not admit of real con|&s;olation,
and, contemning the common|place
terms of &s;uperficial com&s;ort, &s;he was
&s;ilent; while Madame Montoni, jealous of
her own con&s;equence, miftook this for the
&s;ilence of indifference, or of contempt, and
reproached her with want of duty and feel|ing.</P>
<P>&startq;O! I &s;u&s;pected what all this boa&s;ted
<PB N="318" REF="320">
&s;en&s;ibility would prove to be!&endq; rejoined
&s;he; &startq;I thought it would not teach
you to feel either duty, or affection, for
your relations, who have tgreated you like
their own daughter!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Pardon me, madam,&endq; &s;aid Emily,
mildly, &startq;it is not natural to me to boa&s;t,
and it it was, I am &s;ure I would not boa&s;t
of &s;en&s;ibility&mdash;a quality, perhaps, more to
be feared, than de&s;ired.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Well, well, niece, I will not di&s;pute
with you. But, as I &s;aid, Montoni threat|ens
me with violence, if I any longer refu&s;e
to &s;ign away my &s;ettlements, and this was
the &s;ubject our conte&s;t, when you came
into the room before. Now, I am deter|mined
no power on earth &s;hall make me do
this. Neither will I bear all this tamely.
He &s;hall hear his true character from me;
I will tell him all he de&s;erves, in &s;pite of
his threas and cruel treatment.&endq;</P>
<P>Emily &s;eized a pau&s;e of Madame Mon|oni's
voice, to &s;peak. &startq;Dear madam,&endq;
&s;aid &s;he, &startq;but will not this &s;erve to irri|tate
<PB N="319" REF="321">
the Signor unnece&s;&s;arily? will it not
provoke the har&s;h treatment you dread?&endq;</P>
<P>"I do not care,&endq; replied Madame Mon|toni,
&startq;it does not &s;ignify: I will not &s;ubmi$
to &s;uch u&s;age. You would have me give
up my &s;ettlements, too, I &s;uppo&s;e!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;No, madam, I do not exactly mean
that.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;What is it you do mena then?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;You &s;poke of reproaching the Signor,&endq;
&mdash;&s;aid Emily, with he&s;itation. &startq;Why, does
he not de&s;erve repraoaches?&endq; &s;aid her aunt.</P>
<P>&startq;Certainly he does; but will it be pru|dent
in you, madam, to make them?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Prudent!&endq; exclaimed Madame Montoni.
&startq;Is this a time to talk of prudence, when
one is threatened with all &s;orts of violence?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;It is to avoid that violence, that pru|dence
is nece&s;&s;ary,&endq; &s;aid Emily.</P>
<P>&startq;Of prudence!&endq; continued Madame
Montoni, without attending to her, &startq;of
prudence towards a man, who does not
&s;cruple to break all the common ties of
humanity in his conduct to me! And is it
<PB N="320" REF="322">
for me to con&s;ider prudence in my beha|viour
towards him! I am not &s;o mean.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;It is for your own &s;ake, not for the
Signor's, madam,&endq; &s;aid Emily mode&s;tly,
&startq;that you &s;hould con&s;ult prudence. Your
reproaches, however ju&s;t, cannot puni&s;h
him, but they may provoke him to further
violence again&s;t you.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;What! would you have me &s;ubmit,
then, to whatever he commands&mdash;would
you have me kneel down at his feet, and
thank him for his cruelties? Would you
have me give up my &s;ettlements?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;How much you mi&s;take me, ma|dam!&endq;
&s;aid Emily, &startq;I am unequal to ad|vi&s;e
you on a point &s;o important as the la&s;t:
but you will pardon me for &s;aying, that, if
you con&s;ult your own peace, you will try
to conciliate Signor Montoni, rather that
to irritate him by reproaches.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Conciliate indeed! I tell you, niece,
it is utterly impo&s;&s;ible; I di&s;dain to at|tempt
it.&endq;</P>
<P>Emily was &s;hocked to ob&s;erve the per|verted
<PB N="321" REF="323">
under&s;tanding and ob&s;tinate temper
of Madame Montoni; but, not le&s;s grieved
for her &s;ufferings, &s;he looked round for
&s;ome alleviating circum&s;tance to offer her.
&startq;Your &s;ituation is, perhaps, not &s;o de&s;pe|rate,
dear madam,&endq; &s;aid Emily, &startq;as you
may imagine. The Signor may repre&s;ent
his affairs to be wor&s;e than they are, for the
purpo&s;e of pleading a &s;tronger nece&s;&s;ity for
his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of your &s;ettlement. Be&s;ides,
&s;o long as you keep this, you may look
forward to it as a re&s;ource, at lea&s;t, that
will afford you a competence, &s;hould the
Signor's future conduct compel you to &s;ue for &s;eparation."</P>
<P>Madame Montoni impatiently interrupt|ed
her. &startq;Unfeeling, cruel girl!&endq; &s;aid &s;he,
&startq;and &s;o you would per&s;uade me, that I
have no rea&s;on to complain; that the Sig|nor
is in very flouri&s;hing circum&s;tances,
that my future pro&s;pects promi&s;e nothing
but comfort, and that my griefs are as fanci|ful
and romantic as your own! Is it the
way to con&s;ole me, to endeavour to per|&s;uade
<PB N="322" REF="324">
me out of my &s;en&s;es and my feelings,
becau&s;e you happen to have no feelings
your&s;ell? I thought I was opening my
heart to a per&s;on, who could &s;ympathize in
my di&s;tre&s;s, but I find, that your people of
&s;en&s;ibility can feel for nobody but them|&s;elves!
6ou may retire to your chamber."</P>
<P>Emily, without replying, immediately left
the room, with a mingled emotion of pity
and contempt, and ha&s;tened to her own,
where &s;he yielded to the mournful reflec|tions,
which a knowledge of her aunt's &s;itua|tion
had occa&s;ioned. The conver&s;ation
of the Italian with Varancourt, in France,
again occurred to her. His hints, re&s;pect|ing
the broken fortunes of Montoni, were
now completely ju&s;tified; tho&s;e, al&s;o, con|cerning
his character, appeared not le&s;s &s;o,
though the particular circum&s;tances, con|nected
with his fame, to which the &s;tranger
had ailuded, yet remained to be explained.
Notwith&s;tanding, that her own ob&s;erva|tions
and the words of Count Morano had
convinced her, that Montoni's &s;ituation was
<PB N="323" REF="325">
not what it formerly appeared to be, the
intelligence &s;he had ju&s;t received from her
aunt on this point, &s;truck her with all the
force of a&s;toni&s;hment, which was not weak|ened,
when &s;he con&s;idered the pre&s;ent &s;tlyle
of Montoni's living, the number of &s;ervants
he maintained, and the new expences he
was incurring, by repairing and fortifying
his ca&s;tle. Her anxiety for her aunt and
for her&s;elf increa&s;ed with reflection. Se|veral
a&s;&s;ertions of Morano, which, on the
preceding night, &s;he had believed were
prompted either by intere&s;t, or by re&s;ent|ment,
now returned to her mind with the
&s;trenght of truth. She could not doubt,
that Montoni had formerly agreed to give
her to the Count, for a pecuniary reward;&mdash;
his character, and his di&s;tre&s;&s;ed circum|&s;tances
ju&s;tified the belief; the&s;e, al&s;o,
&s;eemed to confirm Morano's a&s;&s;ertion, that
he now de&s;igned to di&s;po&s;e of her, more ad|vantageou&s;ly
for him&s;elf, to a richer &s;uitor.</P>
<P>Amid&s;t the reproaches, which Morano
had thrown our again&s;t Montoni, he had
<PB N="324" REF="326">
&s;aid&mdash;he would not quit the ca&s;tle <HI>be dared
to call his,</HI> nor wiilingly leave <HI>another</HI> mur|der
on his con&s;cience&mdash;hints, which might
have no other origin than the pa&s;&s;ion of the
moment: but Emily was now inclined to
account for them more &s;eriou&s;ly, and &s;he
&s;huddered to think, that &s;he was in the
hands of a man, to whom it was even po&s;|&s;ible
they could applly. At length, con&s;i|dering,
that reflection could neither relea&s;e
her from her melancholy &s;ituation, or ena|ble
her to bear it with greater fortitude,
&s;he tried to divert her anxiety, and took
down from her little library a volume of
her favourite Ario&s;to; but his wild imagery
and rich invention could not long enchant
her attention; his &s;pells did not reach her
heart, and over her &s;leeping fancy they
played, without awakening it.</P>
<P>She now put a&s;ide the book, and took
her lute, for it was &s;eldom that her &s;uffer|ings
refu&s;ed to yield to the magic of &s;weet
&s;ounds; when they did &s;o, &s;he was oppre&s;&s;ed
by &s;orrow, that came from exce&s;s of tender|ne&s;s
<PB N="325" REF="327">
and regret; and there were times,
when mu&s;ic had increa&s;ed &s;uch &s;orrow
to a degree, that was &s;carcely endura|ble;
when, if it had not &s;uddenly cea&s;ed,
&s;he might have lo&s;t her rea&s;on. Such
was the time, when &s;he mourned for her
father, and heard the midnight &s;trains,
that floated by her window near the convent
in Languedoc, on the night that followed
his death.</P>
<P>She continued to play, till Annette
brought dinner into her chamber, at which
Emily was &s;urpri&s;ed, and enquired who&s;e
order &s;he obeyed. &startq;My lady's ma'am|&s;elle,&endq;
replied Annette: &startq;the Signor or|dered
her dinner to be carried to her own
apartment, and &s;o &s;he has &s;ent you yours.
There have been &s;ad doings between them,
wor&s;e than ever, I think.&endq;</P>
<P>Emily, not appearing to notice what
&s;he &s;aid, &s;at down to the little table, that
was &s;pread for her. But Annette was not
to be &s;ilenced thus ea&s;ily. While &s;he waited,
&s;he told of the arrival of the men, whom
<PB N="326" REF="328">
Emily had ob&s;erved on the ramparts, and
expre&s;&s;ed much &s;urpri&s;e at their &s;trange ap|pearance,
as well as at the manner, in
which they had been attended by Montoni's
order. &startq;Do they dine with the Signor,
then?&endq; &s;aid Emily.</P>
<P>&startq;No, ma'am&s;elle, they dined long ago,
in an apartment at the north end of the ca&s;|tle,
but I know not when they are to go,
for the Signor told old Carlo to &s;ee them
provided with every thing nece&s;&s;ary. They
have been walking all about the ca&s;tle, and
a&s;king que&s;tions of the workmen on the
ramparts. I never &s;aw &s;uch &s;trange-look|ing
men in my life; I am frightened when|ever
I &s;ee them.&endq;</P>
<P>Emily enquired, if &s;he had heard of
Count Morano, and whether he was likely
to recover: but Annette only knew, that
he was lodged in a cottage in the wood
below, and that every body &s;aid he mu&s;t die.
Emily's countenance di&s;covered her emotion.</P>
<P>&startq;Dear ma'am&s;elle,&endq; &s;aid Annette," to
&s;ee how young ladies will di&s;gui&s;e them|&s;elves,
<PB N="327" REF="329">
when they are in love! I thought
you hated the Count, or I am &s;ure I would
not have told you; and I am &s;ure you have
cau&s;e enough to hate him.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I hope I hate nobody,&endq; replied Emily,
trying to &s;mile; &startq;but certainly I don not
love Count Morano. I &s;hould be &s;hocked to
hear of any per&s;on dying by violent means.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Yes, ma'am&s;elle, but it is his own
fault.&endq;</P>
<P>Emily looked di&s;plea&s;ed; and Annette,
mi&s;taking the cau&s;e of her di&s;splea&s;ure, im|mediately
began to excu&s;e the Count, in her
way. &startq;To be &s;ure, it was very ungenteel
behaviour,&endq; &s;aid &s;he, &startq;to break into a
lady's room, and then, when he found his
di&s;cour&s;ing was not agreeable to her, to re|fu&s;e
to go; and then, when the gentleman
of the ca&s;tle comes to de&s;ire him to walk
about his bu&s;ine&s;s&mdash;to turn round, and
draw his &s;word, and &s;wear he'll run him
though the body!&mdash;To be &s;ure it was very
ungenteel behaviour, but then he was di&s;|gui&s;ed
in love, and &s;o did not know what
he was about.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="328" REF="330">
&startq;Enough of this,&endq; &s;aid Emily, who now
&s;miled without an effort; and Annette re|turned
to a mention of the de&s;agreement be|tween
Montoni, and her lady. &startq;It is no|thing
new,&endq; &s;aid &s;he: &startq;we &s;aw and heard
enough of this at Venice, though I never
told you of it, ma'am&s;elle.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Well, Annette, it was very prudent of
you not to mention it then: be as prudent
now; the &s;ubject is an unplea&s;ant one.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Ah dear, ma'am&s;elle!&mdash;to &s;ee now how
con&s;iderate you can be about &s;ome folks,
who care &s;o little about you! I cannot
bear to &s;ee you &s;o deceived, and I mu&s;t tell
you. But it is all for your own good, and
not to &s;pite my lady, though, to &s;peak truth,
I have little rea&s;on to love her; but&mdash;&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;You are not &s;peaking thus of my aunt,
I hope, Annette?&endq; &s;aid Emily, gravely.</P>
<P>&startq;Yes ma'am&s;elle, but I am, though; and
if you knew as much as I do, you would
not look &s;o angry. I have often, and often,
heard the Signor and her talking over your
marriage with the Count, and &s;he always
<PB N="329" REF="331">
advi&s;ed him never to give up to your fooli&s;h
whims, as &s;he was plea&s;ed to call them, but
to be re&s;olute, and compel you to be obe|dient,
whether you would, or no. And I
am &s;ure, my heart has ached a thou&s;and
times, and I have thought, when &s;he was &s;o
unhappy her&s;elf, &s;he might have felt a little
for other people, and&mdash;&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I thank you for your pity, Annette,&endq;
&s;aid Emily, interrupting her: &startq;but my aunt
was unhappy then, and that di&s;turbed her
temper perhaps, or I think&mdash;I am &s;ure&mdash;
You may take away, Annette, I have done.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Dear, ma'am&s;elle, you have eat nothing
at all! Do try, and take a little bit more
Di&s;turbed her temper truly! why, her tem|per
is always di&s;turbed, I think. And at
Tholou&s;e too I have heard my lady talking
of you and Mon&s;. Valancourt to Madame
Merveille and Madame Vai&s;on, often and
often, in a very ill-natured way, as I thought,
telling them what a deal of trouble &s;he had
to keep you in order, and what a fatigue
and di&s;tre&s;s it was to her, and that &s;he be|lieved
<PB N="330" REF="332">
you would run away with Mon&s;. Va|lancourt,
if &s;he was not to watch you clo&s;ely;
and that you connived at his coming about
the hou&s;e at night, and&mdash;&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Good God!&endq; excalimed Emily, blu&s;h|ing
deeply, &startq;it is &s;urely impo&s;&s;ible my aunt
could thus have repre&s;ented me!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Indeed, ma'am, I &s;ay nothing more
than the truth, and not all of that. But I
thought, my&s;elf, &s;he might have found &s;ome|thing
better to di&s;cour&s;e about, than the
faults of her own niece, even if you had
been in fault, ma'am&s;elle; but I did not be|lieve
a word of what &s;he &s;aid. But my
lady does not care what &s;he &s;ays again&s;t any
body, for that matter.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;However that may be, Annette,&endq; inter|rupted
Emily, recovering her compo&s;ure,
&startq;it does not become you to &s;peak of the
faults of my aunt to me. I know you have
meant well, but&mdash;&s;ay no more.&mdash;I have
quite dined.&endq;</P>
<P>Annette blu&s;hed, looked down, and then
began &s;lowly to clear the table.</P>
<P><PB N="331" REF="333">
&startq;Is this, then, the reward of my ingenu|ou&s;ne&s;s?&endq;
&s;aid Emily, when &s;he was alone;
&startq;the treatment I am to receive from a re|lation
&mdash;an aunt&mdash;who ought to have been
the guardian, not the &s;landerer of my repu|tation,
&mdash;who, as a woman, ought to have
re&s;pected the delicacy of female honour,
and, as a relation, &s;hould have protected
mine! But, to utter fal&s;ehoods on &s;o nice
a &s;ubject&mdash;to repay the openne&s;s, and, I
may &s;ay with hone&s;t pride, the propriety of
my conduct, with &s;landers&mdash;required a de|pravity
of heart, &s;uch as I could &s;carcely
have believed exi&s;ted, &s;uch as I weep to
find in a relation. O! what a contra&s;t
does her character pre&s;ent to that of my be|loved
father; while envy and low cunning
form the chief traits of hers, his was di&s;|tingui&s;hed
by benevolence and philo&s;ophic
wi&s;dom! But now, let me only remember,
if po&s;&s;ible, that &s;he is unfortunate.&endq;</P>
<P>Emily threw her veil over her, and went
down to walk upon the ramparts, the only
walk, indeed, which was open to her,
<PB N="332" REF="334">
though &s;he often wi&s;hed, that &s;he might be
permitted to ramble among the woods be|low,
and &s;till more, that &s;he might &s;ome|times
explore the &s;ublime &s;cenes of the &s;ur|rounding
country. But, as Montoni would
not &s;uffer her to pa&s;s the gates of the ca&s;tle,
&s;he tried to be contented with the romantic
views &s;he beheld from the walls. The pea|&s;ants,
who had been employed on the forti|fications,
had left their work, and the ram|parts
were &s;ilent and &s;olitary. Their lonely
appearance, together with the gloom of a
lowering &s;ky, a&s;&s;i&s;ted the mu&s;ings of her mind,
and threw over it a kind of melancholy tranquillity,
&s;uch as &s;he often loved to indulge. She
turned to ob&s;erve a fine effect of the &s;un,
as his rays, &s;uddenly &s;traming from behind
a heavy cloud, loghted up the we&s;t towers
of the ca&s;tle, while the re&s;t of the edifice
was in deep &s;hade, except, that, though a
lofty gothic arch, adjoining the tower, which
led to another terrace, the beams darted in
full &s;plendour, and &s;hewed the three &s;trangers
&s;he had ob&s;erved in the morning. Perceiv|ing
<PB N="333" REF="335">
them, &s;he &s;tarted, and a momentary fear
came over her, as &s;he looked up the long
rampart, and &s;aw no other per&s;ons. While
&s;he he&s;itated, they apporoached. The gate at
the end of the terrace, whither they were
advancing, &s;he knew, was always locked,
and &s;he could not depart by the oppo&s;ite
extremity, without meeting them; but, be|fore
&s;he pa&s;&s;ed them, &s;he ba&s;tily drew a thin
veil over her face, which did, indeed, bu ill
conceal her beauty. They looked earne&s;tly
at her, and &s;poke to each other in bad Ita|lian,
of which &s;he caught only a few words;
but the fiercene&s;s of their contenances, now
that &s;he was near enough to di&s;criminate
them, &s;truck her yet more than the wild
&s;ingularity of their air and dre&s;s had for|merly
done. It was the countenance and
figure of him, who walked between the other
two, that chiefly &s;eized her attention, which
expre&s;&s;ed a &s;ullen haughtine&s;s and a kind of
dark watchful villany, that gave a thrill of
horror to her heart. All this was &s;o legibly
written on his features, as to be &s;een by a
<PB N="334" REF="336">
&s;single glance, for &s;he pa&s;&s;ed the group
&s;wiftly, and her timid eyes &s;carcely re&s;ted
on them a moment. Having reached the
terrace, &s;he &s;topped, and perceived the
&s;trangers &s;tanding in the &s;hadow of one of
the turrets, gazing after her, and &s;eemingly,
by their action, in earne&s;t conver&s;ation. She
immediately left the rampart, and retired to
her apartment.</P>
<P>In the evening, Montoni &s;at late, carou&s;|ing
with his gue&s;ts in the cedar chamber.
His recent triumph over Count Morano, or,
perhaps, &s;ome other circum&s;tance, contri|buted
to elevate his &s;pirits to an unu&s;ual
height. He filled the goblet often, and
gave a loo&s;e to merriment and talk. The
gaiety of Cavigni, on the contrary, was
&s;omewhat clouded by anxiety. He kept
a watchful eye upon Verezzi, whom, with
the utmo&s;t difficulty, he had hitherto re|&s;trained
from exa&s;perating Montoni further
again&s;t Morano, by a mention of his late
taunting words.</P>
<P>One of the company exultingly recurred
<PB N="335" REF="337">
to the event of the preceding evening. Ve|rezzi's
eyes &s;parkled. The mention of Mo|rano
led to that of Emily, of whom they
were all profu&s;e in teh prai&s;e, except Mon|toni,
who &s;at &s;ilent, and then interrupted the
&s;ubject.</P>
<P>When the &s;ervants had withdrawn, Mon|toni
and his friends entered into clo&s;e con|ver&s;ation,
which was &s;ometimes checked by
the ira&s;cible temper of Verezzi, but in
which Montoni di&s;played his con&s;cious &s;u|periority,
by that deci&s;ive look and manner,
which always accompanied the vigour of
his thought, and to which mo&s;t of his com|panions
&s;ubmitted, as to a power, that they
had no right to que&s;tion, though of each
other's &s;elf-importance they were jealou&s;ly
&s;erupulous. A mid&s;t this conver&s;ation, one of
them imprudently introduced again &s;he name
of Morano;and Verezzi, now more heated
by wine, di&s;regarded the expre&s;&s;ive looks of
Cavigni, and gave &s;ome dark hints of what
had pa&s;&s;ed on the preceding night. The&s;e,
however, Montoni did not appear to under|&s;tand,
<PB N="336" REF="338">
for he continued &s;ilent in his chair,
without di&s;covering any emotion, while, the
choier$ Verezzi increa&s;ing with the appa|rent
in&s;entibility Montoni, he at length
told the &s;ugge&s;tion of Morano, that this
ca&s;tle did not lawfully belong to him, and
that he would not wilingly leave another
murder on his con&s;ciences.</P>
<P>&startq;Am I to be in&s;ulted at my own table,
and by my own friends?&endq; &s;aid Montoni,
with a coutenance pale in anger. &startq;Why
are the words of that madman repeated to
me?&endq; Verezzi, who had expected to hear
Montoni's indignation poured forth again&s;t
Morano, and an&s;wered by thanks to him&s;elf,
looked with a&s;toni&s;hment at Cavigni, who
enjoyed his confu&s;ion. &startq;Can you be weak
enough to credit the a&s;&s;ertions of a mad|man?&endq;
rejoined Montoni, &startq;or what is the
&s;ame thing, a man po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the &s;p$rit
of vengeance? But he has &s;ucceeded too
well; you believe what he &s;aid.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Signor,&endq; &s;aid Verezzi, &startq;we believe
only what we know.&endq;&mdash;&startq;How!&endq; inter|rupted
<PB N="337" REF="339">
Montoni, &s;ternly: &startq;produce your
proof.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;We believe only what we know,&endq;
repeated Verezzi, &startq;and we know nothing
of what Morano afferts.&endq; Montoni &s;eem|ed
to recover him&s;elf. &startq;I am ha&s;$y,
my friends,&endq; &s;aid he, &startq;with re&s;pect to
my honour; no man &s;hall que&s;tion it
with impunity&mdash;you did not mean to
que&s;tion it. The&s;e fooli&s;h words are not
worth your remembrance, or my re&s;ent|ment.
Verezzi, here is to your fir&s;t ex|ploit.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Succe&s;s to your fir&s;t exploit,&endq; re echoed
the whole company.</P>
<P>&startq;Noble Signor,&endq; replied Verezzi, glad
to find he had e&s;eaped Montoni's re&s;ent|ment,
&startq;with my good will, you &s;hall build
your ramparts of gold.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Pa&s;s the goblet,&endq; cried Montoni. &startq;We
will drink to Signora St. Aubert,&endq; &s;aid
Cavigni. &startq;By your leave, we will &s;ir&s;t drink
to the lady of the ca&s;tle,&endq; &s;aid Ber$olini.&mdash;
Montoni was &s;ilent. &startq;To the lady of the
<PB N="338" REF="340">

head.</P>
<P>&startq;I much &s;urpri&s;es me, Signor,&endq; &s;aid
Bertoliei, &startq;that you have &s;o long neglected
this ca&s;tle;it is a noble edifice.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;It &s;uits our purpo&s;e,&endq; replied Montoni,
&startq;and <HI>is</HI> a noble edifice. You know not, it
&s;eems, by what mi&s;chance it came to me.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;It was a lucky mi&s;chance, be it what it
may, Signor,&endq; replied Bertolini, &s;miling.
&startq;I would, that one &s;o lucky had befallen
me.&endq;</P>
<P>Montoni looked gravely at him. &startq;If
you will attend to what I &s;ay,&endq; he re&s;umed,
&startq;you &s;hall hear the &s;tory.&endq;</P>
<P>The countenances of Bertolini and Ve|rezzi
expre&s;&s;ed &s;omething more than curio|&s;ity;
Cavigni, who &s;eemed to feel none, had
probably heard te relation before.</P>
<P>&startq;It is now near twenty years,&endq; &s;aid
Montoni, &startq;&s;ince this ca&s;tle came into my
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. I inherit it by the female line.
The lady, my predece&s;&s;or, was only di&s;tantly
related to me; I am the la&s;t of her family.
<PB N="339" REF="341">
She was beautiful and rich; I wooed her;
but her heart was fixed upon another, and
&s;he rejected me. It is probable, however,
that &s;he was her&s;elf rejected of the per|&s;on,
whoever he might be, on whom
&s;he be&s;towed her favour, for a deep and
&s;ettled melancholy took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of her;
and I have rea&s;on to believe &s;he put a pe|riod
to her own life. I was not at the ca&s;tle
at the time; but, as there are &s;ome &s;ingular
and my&s;terious circum&s;tances attending that
event, I &s;hall repeat them.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Repeat them.&endq; &s;aid a voice.</P>
<P>Montoni was &s;ilent; the que&s;ts looked
at each other, to know who fpoke; but
they perceived, that each was making the
&s;ame enquiry. Montoni at length, recover|ing
him&s;elf, &startq;We are overheard,&endq; &s;aid he:
&startq;we will fini&s;h this &s;ubject another time.
Pafs the goblet.&endq;</P>
<P>The cavaliers looked round the wide chamber.</P>
<P>&startq;Here is no per&s;on, but our&s;elves,;; &s;aid
Verezzi: &startq;pray, Signor, proceed.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="340" REF="342">
&startq;Did you hear any thing?&endq; &s;aid Mon|toni.</P>
<P>&startq;We did,&endq; &s;aid Bertolini.</P>
<P>&startq;It could be only fancy,&endq; &s;aid Verezzi,
looking round again. &startq;We &s;ee no per&s;on
be&s;ides our&s;elves; and the &s;ound I thought
I heard &s;eemed within the room. Pray, Sig|nor,
go on&endq;</P>
<P>Montoni pau&s;ed a moment, and then pro|ceeded
in a lowered voice, while the cava|liers
drew nearer to attend.</P>
<P>&startq;Ye are to know, Signors, that the Lady
Laurentini had for &s;ome months &s;hewn
&s;ymptoms of a dejected mind, nay, of a
di&s;trubed imagination. Her mood was very
unequal; &s;ometimes &s;he was &s;unk in calm
melancholy, and, at others, as I have been
told, &s;he betrayed all the &s;ymptoms of fran|tic
madne&s;s. It was one night in the month
of October, after &s;he had recovered from
one of tho&s;e fits of exce&s;s, and had &s;unk again
into her u&s;ual melancholy, that &s;he retired
alone to her chamber, and forbade all inter|ruption.
It was the chamber at the end of
<PB N="341" REF="343">
the corridor, Signors, where we had the
affray, la&s;t night. From that hour, &s;he was
&s;een no more.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;How! &s;een no more!&endq; &s;aid Bertolini,
&startq;was not her body found in the cham|ber?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Were her remains never found?&endq; cried
the re&s;t of the company all together.</P>
<P>&startq;Never!&endq; replied Montoni.</P>
<P>&startq;What rea&s;ons were there to &s;uppo&s;e
&s;he de&s;troyed her&s;elf, then?&endq; &s;aid Bertolini.
&mdash;&startq;Aye, what rea&s;ons?&endq; &s;aid Verezzi.&mdash;
&startq;How happened it, that her remains were
never found? Although &s;he killed her&s;elf,
&s;he could not bury her&s;elf.&endq; Montoni
looked indignantly at Verezzi, who began
to apologize. &startq;Your pardon, Signor,&endq;
&s;aid he: &startq;I did not con&s;ider, that the lady
was your relative, when I &s;poke of her &s;o
lightly.&endq;</P>
<P>Montoni accepted the apololgy.</P>
<P>&startq;But the Signor will oblige us with the
rea&s;ons, which urged him to believe, that
the lady committed &s;uicide.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="342" REF="344">
&startq;Tho&s;e I will explain herafter,&endq; &s;aid
Montoni: &startq;at pre&s;ent let me relate a mo&s;t
extraordinary circum&s;tance. This conver|&s;ation
goes no further, Signors. Li&s;ten,
then, to what I am going to &s;ay.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Li&s;ten!&endq; &s;aid a voice.</P>
<P>They were all again &s;ilent, and the coun|tenance
of Montoni changed. &startq;This is no
illu&s;ion of the fancy,&endq; &s;aid Cavigni, at
length breaking the profound &s;elence.&mdash;
&startq;No,&endq; &s;aid Bertolini; &startq;I heard it my&s;elf,
now. Yet here is no per&s;on in the room
but our&s;elves!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;This is very extraordinary,&endq; &s;aid Mon|toni,
&s;uddenly ri&s;ing. &startq;This is not to be
borne; here is &s;ome deception, &s;ome trick.
I will know what it means.&endq;</P>
<P>All the company ro&s;e from their chairs
in con&s;ution.</P>
<P>&startq;it is very odd!&endq; &s;aid Bertolini.
&startq;Here is really no &s;tranger in the room.
If it is a trick, Signor, you will do well to
puni&s;h the author of it &s;everely.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="343" REF="345">
&startq;A trick! what el&s;e can it be?&endq; &s;aid
Cavigni, affecting a laugh.</P>
<P>The &s;ervants were now &s;ummoned, and
the chamber was &s;earched, but no per|&s;on
was found. The &s;urpri&s;e and con&s;ter|nation

gue&s;ts were equally ready to quit the apart|ment;
but the &s;ubject had rou&s;ed their cu|rio&s;ity,
they entreated Montoni to with|draw
to another chamber, and fini&s;h it; no
entreaties could, however, prevail with him.
Notwith&s;tanding his efforts to appear at ea&s;e,
he was vi&s;ibly and greatly di&s;ordered.</P>
<P>&startq;Why, Signor, you are not &s;uper&s;ti|tious,&endq;
cried Verezzi, jeeringly; &startq;you,
who have &s;o o$ten laughed at the credulity
of others!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I am not &s;uper&s;titious,&endq; replied Mon|toni,

with Emily, or from the objects they had
viewed together, which appeared to him
memorials of her affection, as well as a
kind of &s;urety for its faithfulne&s;s; and, next
to the pain of bidding her adieu, was that
of leaving the &s;cenes, which &s;o powerfully
awakened her image. Sometimes he had
<PB N="346" REF="348">
bribed a &s;ervant, who had been left in the
care of Madame Montoni's chateau, to per|mit
him to vi&s;it the gardens, and there he
would wander, for hours together, rapt
in a melancholy, not unplea&s;ing. The ter|race,
and the pavilion at the end of it, where
he had taken leave of Emily, on the eve
of her departure from Tholou&s;e, were his
mo&s;t favourite haunts. There, as he walk|ed,
or leaned from the window of the build|ing,
he would endeavour to recollect all &s;he
had &s;aid, on that night; to catch the tones
of her voice, as they faintly vibrated on his
memory, and to remember the exact ex|pre&s;&s;ion
of her countenance, which &s;ome|times
came &s;uddenly to his fancy, like a
vi&s;ion; that beautiful countenance, which
awakened, as by in&s;tantaneous magic, all
the tenderne&s;s of his heart, and &s;eemed to
cell with irre&s;i&s;lible eloquence&mdash;that he had
loft her forever! At the&s;e moments, his
hurried &s;teps would have di&s;covered to a
&s;pectator the de&s;pair of his heart. The
character of Montoni, &s;uch as he had re|ceived
<PB N="347" REF="349">
from hints, and &s;uch as his fears re|pre&s;ented
it, would ri&s;e to his view, to|gether
with all the dangers it &s;eemed to
threaten to Emily and to his love. He
blamed him&s;elf, that he had not urged the&s;e
more forcibly to her, while it might have
been in his power to detain her, and that
he had &s;uffered an abu&s;urd and criminal de|licacy,
as he termed it, to conquer &s;o &s;oon
the rea&s;onable arguments he had oppo&s;ed
to this journey. Any evil, that might have
attended their marriage, &s;eemed &s;o inferior
to tho&s;e, which now threatened their love,
or even to the &s;ufferings, that ab&s;ence oc|ca&s;ioned,
that he wondered how he could
have cea&s;ed to urge his &s;uit, till he had
convinced her of its propriety; and he
would certainly now have followed her to
Italy, if he could have been &s;pared from
his regiment for &s;o long a journey. His
regiment, indeed, &s;oon reminded him, that
he had other duties to attend, than tho&s;e of
love.</P>
<P>A &s;hort time after his arrival at his bro|ther's
<PB N="348" REF="350">
hou&s;e, he was &s;ummoned to join his
brother officers, and he accompanied a bat|talion
to Paris; where a &s;cene of novelty
and ga$ety opened upon him, &s;uch as, till
then, he had only a faint idea of. But gai|ety
di&s;gu&s;ted, and company fatigued, his
&s;ick mind; and he became an object of un|cea&s;ing
raillery to his companions, from
whom, whenever he could &s;teal an oppor|tunity,
he e&s;caped, to think of Emily. The
&s;cenes around him, however, and the com|pany
with whom he was obliged to mingle,
engaged his attention, though they failed
to amu&s;e his fancy, and thus gradually
weakened the habit of yielding to lamen|tation,
till it appeared le&s;s a duty to his
love to indulge it. Among his brother|officers
were many, who added to the or|dinary
character of French &s;oldier's gai|ety
&s;ome of tho&s;e fa&s;cinating qualities,
which too frequently throw a veil over fol|ly,
and &s;ometimes even &s;often the features
of vice into &s;miles. To the&s;e men the re|&s;erved
and thoughtful manners of Valan|court
<PB N="349" REF="351">
were a kind of tacit cen&s;ure on their
own, for which they rallied him when pre|&s;ent,
and plotted again&s;t him when ab&s;ent;
they gloried in the thought of reducing him
to their own level, and, con&s;idering it to
be a &s;pirited frolic, determined to accom|pli&s;h
it.</P>
<P>Valancourt was a &s;tranger to the gradual
progre&s;s of &s;cheme and intrigue, again&s;t
which he could not be on his guard. He
had not been accu&s;tomed to receive ridi|cule,
and he could ill endure its &s;ting; he
re&s;ented it, and this only drew upon him a
louder laugh. To e&s;cape from such &s;cenes,
he fled into &s;olitude, and there the image
of Emily met him, and revived the pangs
of love and de&s;pair. He then &s;outht to
renew tho&s;e ta&s;teful &s;tudies, which had been
the delight of his early years; but his mind
had lo&s;t the tranquillity, which is nece&s;&s;ary
for their enjoyment. To forget him&s;elf
and the grief and anxiety, which the idea
of her recalled, he would quit his &s;olitude,
and again mingle in the crowd&mdash;glad of a
<PB N="350" REF="352">
temporary relief, and rejoicing to &s;natch
amu&s;ement for the moment.</P>
<P>Thus pa&s;&s;ed weeks after weeks, time
gradually &s;oftening his &s;orrow, and habit
&s;trengthening his de&s;ire of amu&s;ement till
the &s;cenes around him &s;eemed to awaken
into a new character, and Valancourt, to
have fallen among them from the clouds.</P>
<P>His figure and addre&s;s made him a wel|come
vi&s;itor, wherever he had been intro|duced,
and he &s;oon frequented the mo&s;t gay
and fa&s;hionable circles of Paris. Among
the&s;e, was the a&s;&s;embly of the Counte&s;s La|cleur,
a woman of eminent beauty and cap|tivating
manners. She had pa&s;&s;ed the &s;pring
of youth, but her wit prolonged the triumph
of its reign, and they mutually a&s;&s;i&s;ted the
&s;ame of each other; for tho&s;e, who were
charmed by her loveline&s;s, &s;poke with en|thu&s;ia&s;m
of her talents; and others, who
admired her playful imagination, declared,
that her per&s;onal graces were unrivalled.
But her imagination was merely playful,
and her wit, if &s;uch it could be called, was
<PB N="351" REF="353">
brilliant, rather than ju&s;t; it dazzled, and
its fallacy e&s;caped the detection of the mo|ment;
for the accents, in which &s;he pro|nounced
it, and the &s;mile, accompa|nied
them, were a &s;pell upon the judg|ment
of the auditors. Her petits &s;oupers
were the mo&s;t ta&s;teful of any in Paris, and
were frequented by many of the &s;econd cla&s;s
of literati. She was fond of mu&s;ic, was
her&s;elf a &s;cientific performer, and had fre|quently
concerts at her hou&s;e. Valancourt,
who pa&s;&s;ionately loved mu&s;ic, and who
&s;ometimes a&s;&s;i&s;ted at the&s;e concerts, ad|mired
her execution, but remembered with
a &s;igh the eloquent &s;implicity of Emily's
&s;ongs and the natural expre&s;&s;ion of her
manner, which waited not to be approved
by the judgment, but found their way at
once to the heart.</P>
<P>Madame La Comte&s;&s;e had often deep play
at her hou&s;e, which &s;he affected to re&s;train,
but &s;ecretly encouraged; and it was well
known among her friends, that the &s;plen|dour
of her e&s;tabli&s;hment was chiefly &s;up|plied
<PB N="352" REF="354">
from the profits of her tables. But
her petits &s;oupers were the mo&s;t charming
imaginable! Here were all the delicacies of
the four quarters of the world, all the wit and
the lighter efforts of genius, all the graces of
conver&s;ation&mdash;the &s;miles of beauty, and the
charms of mu&s;ic; and Valancou rt pa&s;&s;ed
his plea&s;ante&s;t, as well as mo&s;t dangerous
hours in the&s;e parties.</P>
<P>His brother, who remained with his fa|mily
in Ga&s;cony, had contented him&s;elf
with giving him letters of introduction to
&s;uch of his relations, re&s;iding at Paris, as
the latter was not already known to.
All the&s;e were per&s;ons of &s;ome di&s;tinction;
and, as neither the per&s;on, mind, or man|ners
of Valancourt the younger threatened
to di&s;grace their alliance, they received him
with as much kindne&s;s as their nature, har|dened
by uninterrupted pro&s;perity, would
admit of; but their attentions did not ex|tend
to acts of real friend&s;hip; for they were
too much occupied by their own pur&s;uits,
to feel any inter&s;t in his; and thus he was
<PB N="353" REF="355">
&s;et down in the mid&s;t of Paris, in the pride
of youth, with an open, un&s;u&s;picious tem|perand
ardent affections, without one
friend, to warn him of the dangers, to which
he was expo&s;ed. Emily, who, had &s;he
been pre&s;ent, would have &s;aved him from
the&s;e evils by awakening his heart, and en|gaging
him in worthy pur&s;uits, now only
increa&s;ed his danger;&mdash;it was to lo&s;e the
grief, which the remembrance of her occa|&s;ioned,
that he fir&s;t &s;ought amu&s;ement; and
for this end he pur&s;ued it, till habit made it
an object of ab&s;tract intere&s;t.</P>
<P>There was al&s;o a Marchione&s;s Champfort,
a young widow, at who&s;e a&s;&s;emblies he pa&s;&s;ed
much of his time. She was hand&s;ome, &s;till
more artful, gay and fond of intrigue. The
&s;ociety, which &s;he drew round her, was
le&s;s elegant and more vicious, than that
of the Counte&s;s Lacleur: but, as &s;he had
addre&s;s enough to throw a veil, though
but a &s;light one, over the wor&s;t parts of her
character, &s;he was &s;till vi&s;ited by many per|&s;ons
of what is called di&s;tinction. Valan|court
<PB N="354" REF="356">
was introduced to her parties by two
of his brother officers, who&s;e late ridicule
he had now forgiven &s;o far, that he could
&s;ometimes join in the laugh, which a men|tion
of his former manners would renew.</P>
<P>The gaiety of the mo&s;t &s;plendid court in
Europe, the magnificence of the palaces,
entertainments, and equipages, that &s;ur|rounded
him&mdash;all con&s;pired to dazzle his
imagination, and re-animate his &s;pirits, and
the example and maxims of his military a&s;|&s;ociates
to delude his mind. Emily's image,
indeed, &s;till lived there; but it was no longer
the friend. the monitor, that &s;aved him
from him&s;elf, and to which he retiredto
weep the &s;weet, yet melancholy, tears of
tenderne&s;s. When he had recour&s;e to it, it
a&s;&s;umed a countenance of mild reproach,
that wrung his &s;oul, and called forth tears
of unmixed mi&s;ery; his only e&s;cape from
which was to forget the object of it, and
he endeavoured, therefore, to think of
Emily as &s;eldom as he could.</P>
<P>Thus dangerou&s;ly circum&s;tanced was Va|lancourt,
<PB N="355" REF="357">
at the time, when Emily was &s;uf|fering
at Venice, from the per&s;ecuting ad|dre&s;&s;es
of Count Morano, and the unju&s;t
authority of Montoni; at which period we
leave him.</P>

<BIBL>KING JOHN.</BIBL></Q>
<P>LEAVING the gay &s;cenes of Paris, we
return to tho&s;e of the gloomy Apennine,
where Emily's thoughts were &s;till faithful
to Valancourt. Looking to him as to her
only hope, &s;he recollected with jealous ex|actne&s;s,
every a&s;&s;urance and every proof &s;he
had withne&s;&s;ed of his affection; read again
and again the letters &s;he had received from
him; weighed, with inten&s;e anxiety, the
force of every word, that &s;poke of his attach|ment;
and dried her tears, as &s;he tru&s;ted in
his truth.</P>
<P>Montoni, meanwhile, had made &s;trict en|quiry,
concerning the &s;tarange circum&s;tance
of his alarm, without obtaining information;
and was,d at length, obliged to account for
<PB N="357" REF="359">
it by the re&s;onable &s;uppo&s;ition, that it was
a mi&s;chievous trick played off by one of his
dome&s;tics. His di&s;greements with Ma|dame
Montoni, on the &s;ubject of her &s;et|tlements,
were now more frequent than ever;
he even confined her entirely to her own
apartment, and did not &s;cruple to threaten
her with much greater &s;everity, &s;hould &s;he
per&s;evere in a refu&s;al.</P>
<P>Rea&s;on, had &s;he con&s;ulted it, would now
have perplexed her in the choice of a con|duct
to be adopted. It would have pointed
out the danger of irritating by further op|position
a man, such as Montoni had proved
himself to be, and to who&s;e power &s;he had
&s;o entirely committed her&s;elf; and it would
al&s;o have told her, of what extreme import|ance
to her future comfort it was, to re&s;erve
for her&s;elf tho&s;e po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, which would
enable her to live independently of Mon|toni,
&s;hould &s;he ever e&s;cape from his imme|diate
controul. But &s;he was directed by a
more deci&s;ve guide than rea&s;on&mdash;the &s;pi|rit
of revenge, which urged her to oppo&s;e
<PB N="358" REF="360">
violence to violence, and ob&s;tinacy to ob&s;ti|nacy.</P>
<P>Wholly confined to the &s;olitude of her
apartment, &s;he was now reduced to &s;olicit the
&s;ociety &s;he &s;o lately rejected; for Emily
was the only per&s;on, except Annette, with
whom &s;he was permitted to conver&s;e.
Generou&s;ly anxious for her peace, Emily,
therefore, tried to per&s;uade, when &s;he could
not convince, and &s;ought by every gentle
means to induce her to forbear that a&s;pe|rity
of reply, which &s;o greatly irritated Mon|toni.
The pride of her aunt did &s;ometimes
&s;often to the &s;oothing voice of Emily, and
there even were moments, when &s;he re|graded
her affectionate attentions with good|will.</P>
<P>The &s;cenes of terrible contention, to
which Emily was frequently compelled to
be witne&s;s, exhau&s;ted her &s;pirits more than
any circum&s;tances, that had occurred &s;ince
her departure from Tholou&s;e. The gentle|ne&s;s
and goodne&s;s of her parents, together
with the &s;cenes of her early happine&s;s, often
<PB N="359" REF="361">
&s;tole on her mind, like the vi&s;ions of a
higher world; while the characters and cir|cum&s;tances,
now pa&s;&s;ing beneath her eye,
excited both terror and &s;urpri&s;e. She could
&s;carcely have imagined, that pa&s;&s;ions &s;o
fierce and &s;o various, as those which Mon|toni
exhibited, could have been concen|trated
in one individual; yet what more
&s;urpri&s;ed her, was, that, on great occa&s;ions,
he could bend the&s;e pa&s;&s;ions, wild as they
were, to the cau&s;e of his intere&s;t, and gene|rally
could di&s;gui&s;e in his countenance their
operation on his mind; but &s;he had &s;een
him too often, when he had thought it un|nece&s;&s;ary
to conceal his nature, to be de|ceived
on &s;uch occa&s;ions.</P>
<P>Her pre&s;ent life appeared like the dream
of a di&s;tempered imagination, or like one
of tho&s;e frightful fictions, in which the
wild genius of the poets &s;ometimes de|lighted.
Reflection brought only regret,
and anticipation terror. How often did &s;he
wi&s;h to &startq;&s;teal the lark's wing, and mount
le &s;wifte&s;t gale,&endq; that Languedoc and re|po&s;e
might once more be hers!</P>
<P><PB N="360" REF="362">
Of Count Morano's health &s;he made fre|quent
enquiry; but Annette heard only
vague reports of his danger, and that his
&s;urgeon had &s;aid he would never leave the
cottage alive; while Emily could not but be
&s;hocked to think, that &s;he, however inno|cently,
might be the means of his death;
and Annette, who did not fail to ob&s;erve
her emotion, interpreted it in her own way.</P>
<P>But a circum&s;tance &s;oon occurred which
entirely withdrew Annette's attention from
this &s;ubject, and awakened the &s;urpri&s;e and
curio&s;ity &s;o natural to her. Coming one
day to Emily's apartment, with a counte|nance
full of importance, &startq;What can all
this mean, ma'am&s;elle?&endq; &s;aid &s;he. &startq;Would
I was once &s;afe in Languedoc again, they
&s;hould never catch me going on my travels
any more! I mu&s;t think it a fine thing,
truly, to come abroad, and &s;ee foreign parts!
I little thought I was coming to be catched
up in an old ca&s;tle, among &s;uch dreary
mountains, with the chance of being mur|dered,
or, what is as good, having my
throat cut!&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="361" REF="363">
&startq;What can all this mean, indeed, An|nette?&endq;
&s;aid Emily, in a&s;toni&s;hment.</P>
<P>&startq;Aye, ma'am&s;elle, you may look &s;ur|pri&s;ed;
but you won't believe it, perhaps,
till they have murdered you, too. You
would not believe about the gho&s;t I told

where it u&s;ed to appear!&mdash;You will believe
nothing, ma'am&s;elle.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Not till you &s;peak more rea&s;onably,
Annette; for Heaven's &s;ake, explain your
meaning. You &s;poke of murder!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Aye, ma'am&s;elle, they are coming to
murder us all, perhaps; but what &s;ignifies
explaining?&mdash;you will not believe.&endq;
Emily again de&s;ired her to relate what
&s;he had &s;een, or heard.</P>
<P>&startq;O, I have &s;een enough, ma'am, and
heard too much, as Ludovico can prove.
poor &s;oul! they will murder him, too!
I little thought, when he &s;ung tho&s;e &s;weet
ver&s;es under my lattice, at Venice!&endq;&mdash;Emily
looked impatient and di&s;plea&s;ed. &startq;Well,
ma'am&s;elle, as I was &s;aying, the&s;e prepara|tions
<PB N="362" REF="364">
about the ca&s;tle, and the&s;e &s;trange|looking
people, that are calling here every
day, and the Signor's cruel u&s;age of my
lady, and his odd goings on&mdash;all the&s;e, as I
told Ludovico, can bode no good. And he
bid me hold my tongue. So, &s;ays I, the
Signor's &s;trangely altered, Ludovico, in this
gloomy ca&s;tle, to what he was in France;
there, all &s;o gay! Nobody &s;o gallant to
my lady, the; and he could &s;mile, too,
upon a poor &s;ervant, &s;ometimes, and jeer
her, too, good-naturedly enough. I re|member
once, when he &s;aid to me, as I was
going out of my lady's dre&s;&s;ing-room&mdash;An|nette,
&s;ays he&mdash;&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Never mind what the Signor &s;aid,&endq; in|terrupted
Emily; &startq;but tell me, at once, the
circum&s;tance, which has thus alarmed you.&endq;
"Aye, ma'am&s;elle," rejoined Annette,
"that is ju&s;t what Ludovico &s;aid: &s;ays he,
Never mind what the Signor &s;ays to you.
So I told him what I thought about the
Signor. He is &s;o &s;trangely altered, &s;aid I:
for now he is &s;o haughty, ans &s;o command|ing,
<PB N="363" REF="365">
and &s;o &s;harp with my lady; and, if he
meets one, he'll &s;carcely look at one, unle&s;s
it be to frown. So much the better, &s;ays
Ludovico, &s;o much the better. And to
tell you the truth, ma'am&s;elle, i thought
this was a very ill-natured &s;peech of Ludo|vico
but I went on. And then, &s;ays I,
he is always knitting his brows; and if one
&s;peaks to him, he does not hear; and then
he &s;its up coun&s;elling &s;o, of a nioght, with
the other signors&mdash;there they are, till long
pa&s;t midnight, discour&s;ing together! Aye,
but &s;ays Ludovico, you don't know what
they are coun&s;elling about. No, &s;aid I,
but I can gue&s;s&mdash;it is about my young
lady. Upon that, Ludovico bur&s;t out
a-laughing, quite loud; &s;o he put me
in a huff, for i did not like that either I, or
you, ma'am&s;elle, &s;hould be laughed at; and
I turned away quick, but he &s;topped me.
Don't be affronted, Annette,' said he,
but I cannot help laughing;' and with
that he laughed again. 'What!' &s;ays he,
do you think the Signors &s;it up, night
<PB N="364" REF="366">
after night, only to coun&s;el about thy you ng
lady! No, no, there is &s;omething more in
the wind than that. And the&s;e repairs
about the ca&s;tle, and the&s;e preparations
about the ramparts&mdash;they are not making
about young ladies. Why &s;urely, &s;aid I,
the Signor, my ma&s;ter, is not going to
make war? 'Make war!' &s;aid Ludovico,
'what, upon the mountains and the woods?
for here is no living &s;oul to make war upon,
that I &s;ee.'</P>
<P>"What are the&s;e preparations for, then?
&s;aid I; why &s;urely nobody is coming to
take away my ma&s;ter's ca&s;tle! 'Then there
are &s;o many ill-looking fellows coming to
the ca&s;tle every day,' &s;ays Ludovico, with|out
an&s;wering my que&s;tion, 'and the Sig|nor
&s;ees them allo, and talks with them all,
and they all &s;tay in the neighbourhood!
By holy st. Marco! &s;ome of them are the
mo&s;t cut-throat-looking dogs I ever &s;et my

<P>"I a&s;ked Ludovico again, if he thought
they were coming to take away my ma&s;ter's
<PB N="365" REF="367">
ca&s;tle; and he &s;aid, No, he did not think
they were, but he did not know for certain.
'Then, ye&s;terday,' &s;aid he, but you mu&s;t
not tell this, ma'am&s;elle, 'ye&s;terday, a party
of the&s;e men came, and left all their hor&s;es
in the ca&s;tle &s;tables, where, it &s;eems, they

<P>"So, ma'am&s;elle, I came to tell you all
this, for I never heard any ting &s;o &s;trange

us? And the Signor knows this, or why
&s;hould he be &s;o civil to them? And why
&s;hould he fortify the ca&s;tle, and coun&s;el &s;o
much with the other Signors, and be &s;o
thoughtful?"</P>
<P>"Is this all you have to tell, Annette?"
faid Emily. &startq;Have you heard nothing el&s;e,
that alarms you?"</P>
<P>&startq;Nothing el&s;e, ma'am&s;elle!" &s;aid An|nette;
"why, is not this enough?" &startq;Quite
<PB N="366" REF="368">
enough for my patience, Annette, but not
quite enough to convince me we are all to be
murdered, though I acknowledge here is
&s;ufficient food for curio&s;ity. She forbore
to &s;peak her apprehen&s;ions, becau&s;e &s;he
would not encourage Annette's wild terrors;
but the pre&s;ent circum&s;tances of the ca&s;tle
both &s;urpri&s;ed, and alarmed her. An|nette,
having told her tale, left the cham|ber,
on the wing for new wonders.</P>
<P>In the evening, Emily had pa&s;&s;ed &s;one
melancholy hours with Madame Montoni,
and was retiring to re&s;t, when &s;he was
alarmed by a &s;trange and loud knocking
at her chamber door, and then a heavy
weight fell again&s;t it, that almo&s;t bur&s;t it
open. She called to know who was there,
and receiving no an&s;wer, repeated the call;
but a chilling &s;ilence followed. It occur|red
to her&mdash;for, at this moment, &s;he could
not rea&s;on on the probability of circum|&s;tances
&mdash;that &s;ome one of the &s;trangers,
lately arrived at the ca&s;tle, had di&s;covered
her apartment, and was come with &s;uch
<PB N="367" REF="369">
intent, as their looks rendered too po&s;&s;ible&mdash;
to rob, perhaps to murder, her. The mo|ment
&s;he admitted this po&s;&s;ibility, terror
&s;upplied the place of conviction, and a
kind of in&s;tinctive remembrance of her re|mote
&s;ituation from the family heightened
it to a degree, that almo&s;t overcame her
&s;en&s;es. She looked at the door, which led
to the &s;tair-ca&s;e, expecting to &s;ee it open,
and li&s;tening, in fearful &s;ilence, for a re|turn
of the noi&s;e, till &s;he began to think it
had proceeded from this door, and a wi&s;h of
e&s;caping through the oppo&s;ite one ru&s;hed
upon her mind. She went to the galllery
door, and then, fearing to open it, le&s;t
&s;ome per&s;on might be &s;ilently lurking for
her without, &s;he &s;thopped, but with her eyes
fixed in expectation upon the oppo&s;ite door
of the &s;tair-ca&s;e. As thus &s;he &s;tood, &s;he heard
a faint breathing near her, and became con|vinced,
that &s;ome per&s;on was on the other
&s;ide of the door, which was already locked.
She &s;ought for other fa&s;tening, but there
was none.</P>
<P><PB N="368" REF="370">
While &s;he yet li&s;tened, the breathing was
di&s;tinctly heard, and her terror was not
&s;oothed, when, looking round her wide and
lonely chamber, &s;he again considered her
remote &s;ituation. As &s;he &s;tood he&s;itating
whether to call for a&s;&s;i&s;tance, the continu|ance
of the &s;tillne&s;s &s;urpri&s;ed her; and her
&s;piritrs would have revived, had &s;he not con|tinued
to hear the faint breathing, that con|vinced
her, the per&s;on, whoever it was, had
not quitted the door.</P>
<P>At length, worn out with anxiety, &s;he
determined to call loudly for a&s;&s;i&s;tance
from her ca&s;ement, and was advancing to
it, when, whether the terror of her mind
gave her idea &s;ounds, or that real ones did
come, &s;he thought foot&s;teps were a&s;cending
the private &s;tair ca&s;e; and, expecting to &s;ee
its door unclo&s;e &s;he forgot all other cau&s;e
of alarm, and retreated towards the corri|dor.
Here &s;he endeavoured to make her
e&s;cape, but, on opening the door, was very
near falling over a per&s;on, who lay on the
floor without. She &s;creamed, and would
<PB N="369" REF="371">
have pa&s;&s;ed, but her trembling frame re|fu&s;ed
to &s;upport her; and the moment, in
which &s;he leaned again&s;t the wall of the
gallery, allowed her lie&s;ure to ob&s;erve the
figure before her, and to recogni&s;e the fea|tures
of Annette. Fear in&s;tantly yielded to
&s;urpri&s;e. She &s;poke in vain to the poor
girl, who remained &s;en&s;ele&s;s on the floor,
and then, lo&s;ing all con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of ther own
weakne&s;s, hurried to her a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>When Annette recovered, &s;he was helped
by Emily into the chamber, but was &s;till
unable to &s;peak, and looked round her, as
if her eyes followed &s;ome per&s;on in the
room. Emily tried to &s;ooth her di&s;turbed
&s;pirits, and forbore, at pre&s;ent, to a&s;k her
any questions; but the faculty of &s;peech
was never long with-held from Annette,
and &s;he explained, in broken &s;entences, and
in her tedious way, the occa&s;ion of her di&s;|order.
She Affirmed, and with a &s;olem|nity
of conviction, that almo&s;t &s;taggered
the incredulity of Emily, that &s;he had &s;een
<PB N="370" REF="372">
an apparition, as &s;he was pa&s;&s;ing to her bed|room,
through the corridor.</P>
<P>&startq;I had heard &s;trange &s;tories of that
chamber before,&endq; &s;aid Annette: &startq;but as it
was &s;o near yours, ma'am&s;elle, I would not
tell them to you, becau&s;e they would fright|en
you. the &s;evants had told me, often
and often, that it was haunted, and that
was the rea&s;on why it was &s;hut up: nay, for
that matter, why the whole &s;tring of the&s;e
rooms, here, are &s;hut up. I quaked when|ever
I Went by, and I mu&s;t &s;ay, I did &s;ome|times
think I heard odd noi&s;es within it.
But, as I &s;aid, as I was pa&s;&s;ing along the
corridor, and not thinking a word about the
matter, or even of the &s;tranger voice that
the Signors heard the other night, all of a
&s;udden comes a great light, and, looking
behind me, there was a tall figure, (I &s;aw it
as plainly, ma'am&s;elle, as I &s;ee you at this
moment) a tall figure gliding along (Oh! I
cannot de&s;cribe how!) into the room that
is always &s;hut up, and nobody has the key
<PB N="371" REF="373">
of it but the Signor, and the door &s;hut di|rectly.</P>
<P>&startq;Then it doubtle&s;s was the Signor,&endq;
said Emily.</P>
<P>&startq;O no, ma'am,&s;elle, it could not be him,
for I left him bu&s;y a-quarrelling in my lady's
dre&s;&s;ing-room!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;You bring me &s;trange tales, Annette,&endq;
&s;aid Emily: &startq;it was but this morning,
that you would have terrified me with the
apprehen&s;ion of murder; and now you
would per&s;uade me, you have &s;een a gho&s;t!
The&s;e wonderful &s;tories come too quickly.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Nay, ma'am&s;elle, I will &s;ay no more,
only, if I had not ben frightened, I &s;holuld
not have fainted dead away, &s;o. I ran as fa&s;t
as I could, to get to your door; but, what
was wor&s;t of all, i could not call out; then
I thought &s;omething mu&s;t be &s;tarangely the
matter with me, and directly I dropt down.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Was it the chamber where the black
veil hangs?&endq; &s;aid Emily. &startq;O! no, ma'am|&s;elle,
it was one nearer to this. What &s;hall
I do, to get to my room? I would not go
<PB N="372" REF="374">
out into the corridor again, for the whole
world!&endq; Emily, who&s;e &s;pirits had been
&s;everely &s;hocked, and who, therefore, did
not like the thought of pa&s;&s;ing the night
alone, thold her &s;he might &s;leep where &s;he
was. &startq;O, no, ma'am&s;elle,&endq; replied An|nette,
&startq;I would not &s;liip in the room,
now, for a tho&s;and &s;equins!&endq;</P>
<P>Wearied and di&s;appointed, Emily fir&s;t
$idiculed, though &s;he &s;hared, her fears, and
then tried to &s;ooth them; but neither at|tempt
&s;ucceeded, and the girl per&s;i&s;ted in
believing and affirming, that what &s;he had
&s;een was nothing human. It was not till
&s;ome time after Emily had recovered her
compo&s;ure, that &s;he recollected the &s;teps &s;he
had heard on the &s;tair-ca&s;e&mdash;a remembrance,
however, which made her in&s;i&s;t that An|nette
&s;hould pa&s;s the night with her, and,
with much difficulty, &s;he, at length, pre|vailed,
a&s;&s;i&s;ted by that part of the girl's
fear, which concerned the corridor.</P>
<P>Early on the following morning, as
Emily cro&s;&s;ed the hall to the ramparts, &s;he
<PB N="373" REF="375">
heard a noi&s;y bu&s;tle in the court-yard, and
the clatter of hor&s;es' hoofs. such unu&s;ual
&s;ounds excited her curio&s;ity; and, in&s;tead of
going to the ramparts, &s;he went to an
upper ca&s;ement, from whence &s;he &s;aw, in
the court below, a large party of hor&s;e|men,
dre&s;&s;ed in a &s;ingular, but uniform,
habit, and completely, though variou&s;ly,
armed. They wore a kind of &s;hort jacket,
compo&s;ed of black and &s;carlet, and &s;everal
of them had a cloak, of plain black, which,
covering the per&s;on entirely, hung down to
the &s;tirrups. As one of the&s;e cloaks glanced
a&s;ide, &s;he &s;aw, beneath, daggers, apparently
of different &s;izes, tucked into the hor&s;e|man's
belt. She further ob&s;erved, that
the&s;e were carried, in the &s;ame manner, by
many of the hor&s;emen without cloaks, mo&s;t
of whom bore al&s;o pikes, or javelins. On
their heads, were the &s;mall Italian caps,
&s;ome of which were di&s;tingui&s;hed by black
feathers. Whether the&s;e caps gave a fierce
air to the countenance, or that the counte|nances
they &s;urmounted had naturally &s;uch
<PB N="374" REF="376">
an appearance, Emily thought &s;he had
never, till then, &s;een an a&s;&s;emblage of faces
so &s;avage and terrific. While &s;he gazed,
&s;he almo&s;t fancied her&s;elf &s;urrounded by
banditti; and a vague thought glanced
athwart her fancy&mdash;that Montoni was the
captain of the group before her, and that
this ca&s;tle was to be the place of rendez|vous.
The &s;trange and horrible &s;uppo&s;ition
was but momentary, though her rea&s;on
could &s;upply none more probable, and
though &s;he di&s;covered, among the band,
the &s;trangers &s;he had formerly noticed with
&s;o much alarm, who were now di&s;tingui&s;hed
by the black plume.</P>
<P>While &s;he continued gazing, Cavigni,
Verezzi, and Bertolini came forth from the
hall, habited like the re&s;t, except that they
wore hats, with a mixed plume of black and
&s;carlet, and that their arms differed from
tho&s;e of the re&s;t of the party. As they
mounted their hor&s;es, Emily was &s;truck
with the exulting joy, expre&s;&s;ed on the vi|&s;age
of Verezzi, while Cavigni was gay, yet
<PB N="375" REF="377">
with a &s;hade of thought on his countenance;
and, as he managed his hor&s;e with dexterity,
his graceful and commanding figure, which
exhibited the maje&s;ty of a hero, had never
appeared to more advantage. Emily, as
&s;he ob&s;erved him, thought he &s;omewhat re|&s;embled
Valancourt, in the &s;pirit and dignity
of his per&s;on; but &s;he looked in vain for the
noble, benevolent countenance&mdash;the &s;oul's
intelligence, which over&s;pread the features
of the latter.</P>
<P>As &s;he was hoping, &s;he &s;carcely knew
why, that Montoni would accompany the
party, he appeared at the hall door, but un|accoutred.
Having carefully ob&s;erved the
hor&s;emen, conver&s;ed awhile with the cava|liers,
and bidden them farewel, the band
wheeled round the court, and, led by Ve|rezzi,
i&s;&s;ued forth under the portcullis;
Montoni following to the portal, and gazing
after them for &s;ome time. Emily then
retired from the ca&s;ement, and, now certain
of being unmole&s;ted went to walk on the
ramparts, from whence &s;he &s;oon after &s;aw
<PB N="376" REF="378">
the party winding among the mountains to
the we&s;t, appearing and di&s;appearing be|tween
the woods, till di&s;tance confu&s;ed their
figures, con&s;olidated their numbers, and
only a dingy ma&s;s appeared moving along
the heights.</P>
<P>Emily ob&s;erved, that no workmen were
on the ramparts, and that the repairs of
the fortifications &s;eemed to be completed.
While &s;he &s;auntered thoughtfully on, &s;he
heard di&s;tant foot&s;teps, and, rai&s;ing her eyes,
&s;aw &s;everal men lurking under the ca&s;tle
walls, who were evidently not workmen,
but looked, as if they would have accorded
well with the party which was gone. Won|dering
where Annette had hid her&s;elf &s;o
long, who might have explained &s;ome of
the late circum&s;tances, and then con&s;idereing
that Madame Montoni was probably ri&s;en,
&s;he went to her dre&s;&s;ing-room, where &s;he
mentioned what had occurred; but Madame
Montoni either would not, or could not,
give any explanation of the evednt. The
Signor's re&s;erve to his wife, on this &s;ubject,
<PB N="377" REF="379">
was probably nothing more than u&s;ual; yet,
Emily, it gave an air of my&s;tery to the
whole affair, that &s;eerned to hint, there was
danger, if not villany, in his &s;chemes.</P>
<P>Annette pre&s;ently came, and, as u&s;ual,
was full of alarm; to her lady's eager
enquiries of what &s;he had heard among the
&s;ervants, &s;he replied:</P>
<P>&startq;Ah, Madam! nobody knows what it
is all about, but old Carlo; he knows well
enough, I dare &s;ay, but he is as clo&s;e as
his ma&s;ter. Some &s;ay the Signor is go|ing
out to frighten the enemy, as they
call it: but where is the enemy? Then
others &s;ay, he is going to take away &s;ome
body's c&s;tle: but I am &s;ure he has room
enouth in his own, without taking other
people's; and I am &s;ure i &s;hould like it a
great deal better, if there were more people
to fill it.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Ah! you will &s;oon have your wi&s;h, I
fear,' replied Madame Montoni.</P>
<P>&startq;No, madam, but &s;uch ill-looking fel|lows
are not worth having. I mean &s;uch
<PB N="378" REF="380">
gallant, &s;mart, merry fellows as Ludovico,
who is always telling droll &s;tories, to make
one laugh. It was but ye&s;terday, he told
me &s;uch a humour &s;ome tale! I can't help
laughing at it now.&mdash;Says he&mdash;&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Well, we can di&s;pen&s;e with the &s;tory,&endq;
&s;aid her lady. &startq;Ah!&endq; continued Annette,
'he &s;ees a great way, a great way further
than other people! Now he &s;ees into all
the Signor's meaning, without knowing a
word about the matter!</P>
<P>&startq;How is that?&endq; &s;aid madame Montoni.</P>
<P>&startq;Why he &s;ays&mdash;but he made me promi&s;e
not to telle, and i would not di&s;oblige him
for the world.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;What is it he made you promi&s;e not to
tell?&endq; &s;aid her lady, &s;ternly. &startq;I in&s;i&s;t upon
knowing immediately&mdash;what is it he made
you promise?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;O Madam,&endq; cried Annette, &startq;I would
not tell for the univer&s;e!&endq; &startq;I in&s;i&s;t upon
your telling this instant,&endq; &s;aid Madame
Montoni. &startq;O dear madam! I would not
tell for an hundred &s;equins! You would
<PB N="379" REF="381">
not have me for&s;wear my&s;elf, madam!&endq;
exclaimed Annette.</P>
<P>&startq;I will not wait another moment,&endq; &s;aid
Madame Montoni. Annette was &s;ilent.</P>
<P>&startq;The Signor &s;hall be informed of this
directly,&endq; rejoined her mi&s;tre&s;s: &startq;he will
make you di&s;cover all.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;It is Ludovico, who has di&s;covered,&endq;
&s;aid Annette: &startq;but for mercy's &s;ake, ma|dam,
don't tell the. Signor, and you &s;hall
know all directly.&endq; Madame Montoni
&s;aid, that &s;he would not.</P>
<P>&startq;Well then, madam, Ludovico &s;ays,
that the Signor, my ma&s;ter, is&mdash;is&mdash;that is,
he only thinks &s;o, and any body, you know,
madam, is free to think&mdash;that the Signor,
my ma&s;ter, is&mdash;is&mdash;</P>
<P>&startq;Is what?&endq; &s;aid her lady, impatiently.</P>
<P>&startq;That the Signor, my ma&s;ter, is going
to be&mdash;a great robber&mdash;that is&mdash;he is going
to rob on his own account;&mdash;to be, (but
I am &s;ure I don't under&s;tand what he means)
to be a&mdash;captain of&mdash;robbers.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Art thou in thy &s;en&s;es, Annette?&endq; &s;aid
<PB N="380" REF="382">
Madame Montoni; or is this a trick to de|ceive
me? Tell me, tis in&s;tant, what Lu|dovico
did &s;ay to thee;&mdash;no equivocation;
&mdash;this in&s;tant.</P>
<P>&startq;Nay, madam,&endq; cried Annette, &startq;if this
is all I am to get for having told the &s;e|cret&endq;
&mdash;Her mi&s;tre&s;s thus continued to in|&s;i&s;t,
and Annette to prote&s;t, till Montoni,
him&s;elf, appeared, who bade the latter leave
the room, and &s;he withdrew, trembling for
the fate of her &s;tory. Emily al&s;o was re|tiring,
but her aunt de&s;ired &s;he would &s;tay;
and Montoni had &s;o often made her a wit|ne&s;s
of their contention, that he no longer
had &s;cruples on that account.</P>
<P>&startq;I in&s;i&s;t upon knowing this in&s;tant,
Signor, what all this means:&endq; &s;aid his
wife&mdash;what are all the&s;e armed men,
whom they tell me of, gone out about?
Montoni an&s;wered her only with a look of
&s;corn; and Emily whi&s;pered &s;omething to
her. &startq;It does not &s;ignify,&endq; &s;aid her aunt:
&startq;I will know; and I will know, too, what
the ca&s;tle has been fortified for.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="381" REF="383">
&startq;Come, come, &s;aid Montoini,&endq; other
bu&s;ine&s;s brought me here. I mu&s;t be trifled
with no longer. I have immediate oc|ca&s;ion
for what I demand&mdash;tho&s;e e&s;tates
mu&s;t be given up, without further conten|tion;
or I may find a way&mdash;</P>
<P>&startq;They never &s;hall be given up,&endq; inter|rupted
madame Montoni: &startq;they never
&s;hall enable you to carry on your wild
&s;chemes;&mdash;but what are the&s;e? I will know.
Do you expect the ca&s;tle to be attacked?
Do you expect enemies? Am I to be &s;hut
up here, to be killed in a &s;iege?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Sign the writings,&endq; &s;aid Montoni,
&startq;and you &s;hall know more.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;What enemy can be coming?&endq; con|tinued
his wife. &startq;Have you entered into
the &s;ervice of the &s;tate? Am I to be block|ed
up here to die?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;That may po&s;&s;ibly happen," &s;aid Mon|toni,
&startq;unle&s;s you yield to my demand: for,
come what may, you &s;hall not quit the
ca&s;tle till then." Madame Montoni bur&s;t
<PB N="382" REF="384">
into loud lamentation, which &s;he as &s;ud|denly
checked, con&s;idering, that her hu&s;|band's
a&s;&s;ertions might be only artifices, em|ployed
to extort her con&s;ent. She hinted
this &s;u&s;picion, and, in the next moment, told
him al&s;o, that his de&s;igns were not &s;o ho|nourable
as to &s;erve the &s;tate, and that &s;he
believed he had only commenced a captain
of banditti, to join the enemies of Venice,
in plundering and laying wa&s;te the &s;ur|rounding
country.</P>
<P>Montoni looked at her for a moment
with a &s;teady and &s;tern countenance; while
Emily trembled, and his wife, for once,
thought &s;he had &s;aid too much. &startq;You
&s;hall be removed, this night," &s;aid he, &startq;to
the ea&s;t turrent: there, perhaps, you may
under&s;tand the danger of offending a man,
who has an unlimited power over you."</P>
<P>Emily now fell at his feet, and, with
tears of terror, &s;upplicated for her aunt,
who &s;at, trembling with fear, and indigna|tion;
now ready to pour forth execrations,
<PB N="383" REF="385">
and now to join the interce&s;&s;ions of Emily.
Montoni, however, &s;oon interrupted the&s;e
entreaties with an horrible oath; and, as he
bur&s;t from Emily, leaving his cloak in her
hand, &s;he fell to the floor, with a force, that
occa&s;ioned her a &s;evere blow on the fore|head.
But he quitted the room, without at|tempting
to rai&s;e her, who&s;e attention was
called from her&s;elf, by a deep groan from
Madame Montoni who continued other|wi&s;e
unmoved in her chair, and had not
fainted. Emily, ha&s;tening to her a&s;&s;i&s;tance,
&s;aw her eyes rolling, and her featres con|vul&s;ed.</P>
<P>Having &s;poken to her, without receiving
an an&s;wer, &s;he brought water, and &s;upport|ed
her head, while &s;he held it to her lips;
but the increa&s;ing convul&s;ions &s;oon com|pelled
Emily to call for a&s;&s;i&s;tance. On her
way through the hall, in &s;earch of Annette,
&s;he met Montoni, whom &s;he told what had
happened, and conjured to return and com|fort
her aunt; but he turned &s;ilently away;
with a look of indifference, and went out
<PB N="384" REF="386">
upon the ramparts. At length &s;he found
old Carlo and Annette, and they ha&s;tened
to the dre&s;&s;ing-room, where Madame Mon|toni
had fallen on the floor, and was lying
in &s;trong convul&s;ions. having lifted her
into the adjoining room, and laid her on
the bed, the force of her di&s;order &s;till made
all their &s;trength nece&s;&s;ary to hold her, while
Annette trembled and &s;obbed, and old Car|lo
looked &s;ilently and piteou&s;ly on, as his
feeble hands gra&s;ped tho&s;e of his mi&s;tre&s;s,
till, turning his eyes upon Emily, he ex|claimed,
&startq;God God! Signora, what is the
matter?"</P>
<P>Emily looked calmly at him, and &s;aw
his enquiring eyes fixed on her and An|nette,
looking up, &s;creamed loudly; for
Emily's face was &s;tained with blood, which
continued to fall &s;lowly from her forehead:
but her attention had been &s;o entirely oc|cupied
by the &s;cene before her, that &s;he had
felt no pain from the wound. She now
held an handkerchief to her face, and, not|with&s;tanding
her fantne&s;s, continued to
<PB N="385" REF="387">
watch Madame Montoni, the violence of
who&s;e convul&s;ions was abating, till at
length they cea&s;ed, and left her in a kind
of &s;tupor.</P>
<P>&startq;My aunt mu&s;t remain quiet," &s;aid
Emily. &startq;Go, good Carlo; if we &s;hould
want your a&s;&s;i&s;tance, i will &s;end for you.
In the mean time, if you have an opportu|nity,
&s;peak kindly of your mi&s;tre&s;s to your
ma&s;ter."</P>
<P>&startq;Alas!" &s;aid Carlo, &startq;I have &s;een too
much! i have little in&s;luence with the Sig|nor.
But do, dear young lady, take &s;ome
care of your&s;elf; that is an ugly wound,
and you look &s;adly."</P>
<P>&startq;Thank you, my friend, for your con&s;i|sideration,"
&s;aid Emily, &s;miling kindly:
&startq;the wound is trifling, it came by a fall."</P>
<P>Carlo &s;hook his head, and left the room;
and Emily, with Annette, continued to
watch by her aunt. 'Did my lady tell
the Signor what Ludovico &s;aid, ma'am|&s;elle?"
a&s;ked Annette in a whi&s;per; but
Emly quieted her fears on the &s;ubject.</P>
<P><PB N="386" REF="388">
&startq;I thought what this quarrelling would
come to," continued Annette; &startq;I &s;uppo&s;e
the Signor has been beating my lady."</P>
<P>&startq;No, no, Annette, you are totally mi&s;|taken,
nothing extraordinary has hap|pened."</P>
<P>&startq;Why, extraordinary thoings happen here
&s;o often, ma'am&s;elle, that there is nothing
in them. Here is another legion of tho&s;e
ill-looking fellows, come to the ca&s;tle, this
morning."</P>
<P>&startq;Hu&s;h! Annette, you will di&s;turb my
aunt; we will talk of that by and bye."</P>
<P>They continued watching &s;ilently, till
Madame Montoni uttered a low &s;igh, when
Emily took her had, and &s;poke &s;ooth|ingly
to her; but the former gazed with
uncon&s;cious eyes, and it was long before
&s;he knew her niece. Her fir&s;t words then
enquired for Montoni; to which Emily re|plied
by an entreaty, that &s;he would com|po&s;e
her &s;pirits, and con&s;ent to be kept
quiet, adding, that, if &s;he wi&s;hed any me&s;|&s;age
to be converyed to him, &s;he would her|&s;elf
<PB N="387" REF="389">
deliver it. 'No," &s;aid her aunt faintly
&startq;no&mdash;I have nothing new to tell him. Does
he per&s;i&s;t in &s;aying I &s;hall be removed from
my chamber?"</P>
<P>Emily replied, that he had not &s;poken,
on the pubject, &s;ince Madame Montoni
heard him; and then &s;he tried to divert
her attention to &s;ome other topic; but
her aunt &s;eemed to be inattentive to
what &s;he &s;aid, and lo&s;t in &s;ecret thoghts.
Emily, having brought her &s;ome refre&s;h|ment,
now left her to the care of Annette,
and went in &s;earch of Montoni, Whom &s;he
found on a remote part of the rampart, con|ver&s;ng
among a group of the men de&s;cribed
by Annette. They &s;tood round hom with
fierce, yey &s;ubjugated, looks, while he,
&s;peaking earne&s;tly, and pointing to the
walls, did not perceive Emily, who remained
at &s;moe di&s;tance, waiting till he &s;hould be at
lei&s;ure, and ob&s;erving involuntarily the ap|pearance
of one man, more &s;avage than his
fellow, who &s;tood re&s;ting on his pike, and
looking, over the &s;holders of a comrade,
<PB N="388" REF="390">
at Montoni, to whom he li&s;tened with un|common
earne&s;tne&s;s. This man was appa|rently
of low condition; yet his looks ap|peared
not to acknowledge the &s;uperiority
of Montoni, as did tho&s;e of his companions;
and &s;ometimes they even a&s;&s;umed an air
of authority, which the deci&s;ive manner of
the Signor could not repre&s;s. Some few
words of Montoni then pa&s;&s;ed in the wind;
and, as the men were &s;eparating, &s;he heard
him &s;ay, &startq;This evening, then, being the
watch at &s;un-&s;et."</P>
<P>'At &s;un-&s;et, signor," replied one or
two of them, and walked away; while
Emily approached Montoni, who appeared
de&s;irous of avoiding her: but, though &s;he
ob&s;erved this, &s;he had courage to proceed.
She endeavoured to interceded once more for
her aunt, repre&s;ented to him her &s;ufferings,
and urged the danger of expo&s;ing her to a
cold apartment in her pre&s;ent &s;tate. &startq;She
&s;uffers by her own folly," &s;aid Montoni,
&startq;and is not to be pitied;&mdash;&s;he knows how &s;he
may avoid the&s;e &s;ufferings in future&mdash;if &s;he
<PB N="389" REF="391">
is removed to the turret, it will be her own
fault. Let her be obedient, and &s;ign the
writings you heard of, and I will think no
more of it."</P>
<P>When Emily ventured &s;till to plead, he
&s;ternly &s;ilenced and rebuked her for inter|fering
in his dome&s;tic affairs, but, at length,
di&s;mi&s;&s;ed her with this conce&s;&s;ion&mdash;That he
would not remove Madame Montoni, on
the en&s;uing night, but allow her till the
next to con&s;ider, whether &s;he would re&s;ign
her &s;ettlements, or be impri&s;oned in the ea&s;t
turret of the ca&s;tle, &startq;where &s;he &s;hall find,"
he added, &startq;a puni&s;hment &s;he may not ex|pect."</P>
<P>Emily then ha&s;tened to inform her aunt
of this &s;hort re&s;pite and of the alternative,
that awaited her, to which the latter made
no reply, but appeared thoughtful, while
Emoly, in con&s;ideration of her extreme lan|guor,
wi&s;hed to &s;ooth her mind by leading it
to le&s;s intere&s;ting topics and, though the&s;e ef|forts
were un&s;ucce&s;sful, and Madame Monto|ni
became peevi&s;h, her re&s;olution, on the con|tended
<PB N="390" REF="392">
point, &s;eemed &s;omewhat ro relax, and
Emily recommended, as her only means of
&s;afety, that &s;he &s;hould &s;ubmit to Montoni's
demand. &startq;You know not what you ad|vi&s;e,
&s;aid her aunt. Do you under&s;tand,
that the&s;e e&s;tates will de&s;cend to you at my
death, if I per&s;i&s;t in a refu&s;al?"</P>
<P>&startq;I was ignorant of that circum&s;tance,
madam," replied Emily, 'but the know|ledge
of it cannot with-hold me from ad|vi&s;ing
you to adopt the conduct, which not
only your peace, but, I fear, your &s;afety re|quires,
and I entreat, that you will not &s;uffer
a con&s;ideration comparatively &s;o trifling,
to make you he&s;tate a moment in re&s;igning
them."</P>
<P>&startq;Are you &s;incere, niece?" &startq;Is it po&s;|&s;ible
yopu can doubt it, madam?" Her
aunt appeared to be affected. &startq;You are
not unworthy of the&s;e e&s;tates, niece," &s;aid
&s;he: &startq;I would wi&s;h to keep them for your
&s;ake&mdash;you &s;hiw a virtue I did not ecpect."</P>
<P>&startq;How have I de&s;erved this reproof,
madam?" &s;aid Emily &s;orrowfully.</P>
<P><PB N="391" REF="393">
&startq;Reproof!" replied Madame Montoni:
&startq;I meant to prai&s;e your virtue."</P>
<P>&startq;Alas! here is no exertion of virtue,"
rejoined Emily, &startq;for here is no temptation
to be overcome."</P>
<P>&startq;Yet Mon&s;ieur Valancourt"&mdash;&s;aid her
aunt. &startq;O madan!" interrupted Emily,
anticipating what &s;he would have &s;aid, 'do
not let me glance on that &s;ubject: do not
let my mind be &s;tained with a wi&s;h &s;o &s;hock|ingly
&s;elf-inter&s;ted." She immediately
changed the topic, and continued with Ma|dame
Montoni, till &s;he withdrew to her
apartment for the night.</P>
<P>At that hour, the ca&s;tle was perfectly
&s;till, and every inhabitant of it, except her|&s;elf,
&s;eemed to have retired to re&s;t. As &s;he
pa&s;&s;ed along the wide and lonely galleries,
du&s;ky and &s;ilent, &s;he felt forlorn and appre|hen&s;ive
of&mdash;&s;he &s;carcely knew what; but
when, entering the corridor, &s;he recollected
the incident of the preceding nignt, a dread
&s;eized her, le&s;t a &s;ubject of alarm, &s;imilar to
that, which had befallen Annette, &s;hould oc|cur
<PB N="392" REF="394">
to her, and which, whether reals or
ideal, would, &s;he felt, have an almo&s;t equal
effect upon her weakened &s;pirits. The
chamber, to which Annette had alluded,
&s;he did not exactly know, but under&s;tood
it to be one of tho&s;e &s;he mu&s;t pa&s;s in the
way to her own; and, &s;ending a fearful look
forward into the gloom, &s;he &s;tepped lightly
and cautiou&s;ly along, till, coming to a door,
from whence i&s;&s;ued a low &s;ound, &s;he he&s;i|tated
and pau&s;ed; and, during the delay of
that moment, her fears &s;o much increa&s;ed,
that &s;he had no power to move from the
&s;pot. Believing, that &s;he heard a human
voice within, &s;he was &s;omewhat revived; but,
in the next moment, the door was opened,
and a per&s;on, whom &s;he conceived to be
Montoni, appeared, who in&s;tantly &s;tarted
back, and clo&s;ed it, though not before &s;he
had &s;een, by the light that burrned in the
had &s;een, by the light that burned in the
chamber, another per&s;on, &s;itting in a melan|choly
attitude by the fire. Here terror va|ni&s;hed,
but her a&s;toni&s;hment only began,
which was now rou&s;ed by the my&s;terious
<PB N="393" REF="395">
&s;ecrecy of Montoni's mannr, and the di&s;|covery
of a per&s;on, whom he thus vi&s;ited at
midnight, in an apartment, which had long
been &s;hut up, and of which such extraordi|nary
reports were circulated.</P>
<P>While &s;he thus continued he&s;tating,
&s;trongly prompted to watch Montoni's mo|tions,
yet fearing to irritate him by appear|ing
to notice them, the door was again
opened cautiou&s;ly, and as in&s;tantly clo&s;ed as
before. She then &s;tepped &s;oftly to her
chamber, which was the next but one to
this, but, having put down her lamp, re|turned
to an ob&s;cure corner of the corridor,
$o ob&s;erve the proceedings of this half-&s;een
per&s;on, and to a&s;certain, whether it was in|deed
Montoni.</P>
<P>Having waited in &s;ilent expectation for a
few minutes, with her eyes fixed on the door,
it was again opened, and the same per&s;on ap|peared,
whom &s;he now knew to be Montoni.
He looked cautiou&s;ly round, wothout per|ceiving
her, then, &s;tepping forward, clo&s;ed
the door, and left the corridor. Soon after,
<PB N="394" REF="396">
Emily heard the door fa&s;tened on the in|&s;ide,
and &s;he withdrew to her chamber, won|dering
at what &s;he had witne&s;sed.</P>
<P>It was now twelve o'clock. As &s;he clo&s;ed
her casement, &s;he heard foot&s;teps on the ter|race
below, and &s;aw imperfectly, through
the gloom &s;everal per&s;ons advancing, who
Pa&s;&s;ed under the ca&s;ement. She then heard
the clink of arms, and, in the next moment,
the watch-word; when, recollecting the com|mand
&s;he had over heard from Montoni, and
the hour of the night, &s;he under&s;tood, that
the&s;e men were, for the fir&s;t time, relieving
guard in the ca&s;tle. Having li&s;tened till all
was again &s;till, &s;he retired to &s;leep.</P>

<P>ON the following morning, Emily went
early to the apartment of Madame Mon|toni,
who had &s;lept well, and was much re|covered.
Her &s;pirits al&s;o had returned with
her health, and her re&s;olution to oppo&s;e
Montoni's demands revived, though it yet
&s;truggled with her fears, which Emily, who
trembled for the con&s;equence of further op|po&s;ition,
endeavoured to confirm.</P>
<P>Her aunt, as has been already &s;hewn, had
a di&s;po&s;ition, which delighted in contradic|tion,
and which taught her, when unplea|&s;ant
circum&s;tances were offered to her un|der&s;tanding,
not to enquire into their truth,
<PB N="396" REF="398">
but to &s;eek for arguments, by which &s;he
might make them appear fal&s;e. Long habit
had &s;o entirely confirmed this natural pro|pen&s;ity,
that &s;he was not con&s;cious of po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ing
it. Emily's remon&s;trances and re|pre&s;entations,
therefore, rou&s;ed her pride,
in&s;tead of alarming, or convincing her judg|ment,
and &s;he &s;till relied upon the di&s;covery
of &s;ome means, by which &s;he could once
e&s;cape from his ca&s;tle, &s;he might defy his
power, and, obtaining a deci&s;ive &s;eparation,
live in com&s;ort on the e&s;tates, that yet re|mained
for her, &s;he mentioned this to her
niece, who accorded with her in the wi&s;h,
but differed from her, as to the probability
of its completion. She repre&s;entented the im|po&s;&s;ibility
of pa&s;&s;ing the gates, &s;ecured and
guarded as they were, and the extreme dan|ger
of committing her de&s;ign to the di&s;cre|tion
of a &s;ervant, who might either pur|po&s;ely
betray, or accidentaly di&s;clo&s;e it.&mdash;
Montoni's vengeance would also di&s;dain re|&s;traint,
<PB N="397" REF="399">
if her intention was detected: and,
though Emily dwi&s;hed, as fervently as &s;he
could do, to regain her freedom, and re|turn
to France, &s;he con&s;ulted only Madame
Montoni's &s;afety, and per&s;ervered in advi&s;ing
her to relinqui&s;h her &s;ettlement, without
braving further outrage.</P>
<P>The &s;truggtle of contrary emotions, how|ever,
continued to rage in her aunt's bo&s;om,
and &s;he &s;till brooded over the chance of ef|fecting
an e&s;cape. While &s;he thus &s;at,
Montoni entered the room, and, without
noticing his wife's indi&s;po&s;ition, &s;aid, that
he came to remind her of the impolicy of
trifling with him, and that he gave her only
till the evening to determine, whether &s;he
would con&s;ent to his demand, or compel
him, by a refu&s;al, to remove her to the ea&s;t
turret. He added, that a party of cavaliers
would dine with him, that day, and that he
expected &s;he would &s;it at the head of the
table, where Emily, al&s;o, mu&s;t be pre&s;ent.
Madame Montoni was now on the point of
uttering an ab&s;olute refu&s;al, but, &s;uddenly
<PB N="398" REF="400">
con&s;idering, that her liberty, during this en|tertainment,
though circum&s;cribed, might
favour her further plans, &s;he acquie&s;ced,
with &s;eeming reluctance, and Montoni, &s;oon
after, left the apartment. His command
&s;truck Emily with &s;urpri&s;e and apprehen|&s;ion,
who &s;hrunk from the thoght of being
expo&s;ed to the gaze of &s;trangers, &s;uch as her
fancy repre&s;ented the&s;e to be, and the words
of Count Morano, now again recollected,
did not &s;ooth her fears.</P>
<P>When &s;he withdrew to prepare for din|ner,
&s;he dre&s;&s;ed her&s;elf with even more &s;im|plicity
than u&s;ual, that &s;he might e&s;cape
ob&s;ervation&mdash;a policy, which did not avail
her, for, as &s;he was re-pa&s;&s;ed to her aunt's apart|ment,
&s;he was met by Montoni, who cen|&s;ured
what he called her prudi&s;h appearance,
and in&s;i&s;ted, that &s;he would wear the mo&s;t
&s;plendid dre&s;s &s;he had, even that, which had
been prepared for her intended nuptials
with Count Morano, and which, it now ap|peared,
her aunt had carefully brought with
her from Venice. This was made, not in
<PB N="399" REF="401">
the Venetian, but, in the Neapolitan fa&s;hion,
&s;o as &s;at off the
&s;hape and figure, to the
utmo&s;t afvantage. In it, her beautiful che&s;|nut
tre&s;&s;es were negligently bound up in
pearls, and &s;uffered to fall beck again on
her neck. The &s;implicity of a better tas&s;te,
than Madame Montoni's, was con&s;picuous
in thid dre&s;s, &s;lendid as it was, and Emily's
unaffected beauty never had appeared more
captivatingly. She had now o9nly to hope,
that Montoni's order was prompteed, not by
any extraordinary de&s;ign, but by an o&s;tenta|tion
to the eyes of &s;trangers; yet nothing le&s;s
than hi ab&s;olute command could have pre|vailed
with her to wear a dre&s;s, that had been
de&s;igned for &s;uch an offen&s;ive purpo&s;, much
le&s;s to have owrn it on this occa&s;ion. As
&s;he de&s;cended to dinner, the emotion of her
mind threw a faint blu&s;h over her counte|nace,
and heightened its intere&s;ting expre&s;|&s;ion;
for timidity had made her linger in
her apartment, till the utmo&s;t moment, and,
when &s;he entered the hall, in which a kind
<PB N="400" REF="402">
of &s;tate dinner was &s;pread, Montoni adn
his gue&s;ts were already &s;eated at the table.
She was then going to place her&s;elf by her
aunt; but Montoni waved his hand, and two
of the cavaliers ro&s;e, and &s;eated her between
them.</P>
<P>The eldes&s;t of the&s;e was a tall man, with
&s;rong Italian features, an quiline no&s;,
and dark penetrating eyes, that fla&s;hed with
fire, when his mind was agitated, and, even
in its &s;tate of re&s;, retained &s;omewhat of the
wildne&s;s of the pa&s;&s;ions. His vi&s;age was long
and narrow, and his complexion of a &s;ickly
yellow.</P>
<P>The other, who appeared to be about
forty, had features of a different ca&s;t, yet
Italian, and his look was &s;low, &s;ubtle adn
penetrating; his eyes, of a dark grey, were
&s;mall, and hollow; his complexion was a
&s;un-burnt brown, and the contour of his
face, though inclined to oval, was irregular
and ill-formed.</P>
<P>Eight other gue&s;ts &s;at round the table,
who were all dre&s;&s;ed in an uniform, and had
<PB N="401" REF="403">
all an expre&s;&s;ion, more or le&s;s, of wild fierce|ne&s;s,
of &s;ubtle de&s;ign, or of licentious pa&s;|&s;ions.
As Emily timidly &s;urveyed them,
&s;he remembered the &s;cene of the preceding
mornign, and again almo&s;t fanciedd her|se&s;
&s;urrounded by banditti; then, looking
back to the tranquillity of her early life,
&s;he felt &s;carcely le&s;s a&s;tibu&s;hment, than
grief, at her pre&s;ent &s;tuation. The &s;cene,
in which they &s;at, a&s;&s;i&s;ted the illu&s;ion; it
was an antient hall, gloomy from the &s;tyle
and becau&s;e almo&s;t the only light it re|ceived
was from one large gothic window,
and from a pair of folding doors, which,
being open, admitted likewi&s;e a view of the
we&s;t rampart, with the wild mountains of
the Apennine beyond.</P>
<P>The middle compartment of this hall
ro&s;e into a vaulted roof, enriched with fre$|work,
and &s;upported, on three &s;ides, by
pillars of marble; beyond the&s;e, long co|lonades
retired in gloomy grandeur, till
their extent was lo&s;t in twilight. The
<PB N="402" REF="404">
lighte&s;&s; foot&s;teps of the &s;ervznts, as
they advanced tghroguh the&s;e, were re|turned
in whi&s;pering echoes, and their
figures, &s;een at a di&s;tance imperfectly
Emily's imagination. She looked alter|natley
at Montoni, at his gue&s;ts and on the
her dear native province, her plea&s;ant home
friends, whom &s;he had lo&s;t, grief and &s;ur|pri&s;e
again occupied her mind.</P>
<P>When he thoughts could return form
the&s;e con&s;iderations, &s;he fancied &s;he ob&s;erved
an air of authority towards his gue&s;ts, &s;uch
as &s;he had never before &s;een him a&s;&s;ume,
though he had always been di&s;tingui&s;hed by
an haughty carriage; there was &s;omething
al&s;o in the manners of the &s;trangers, that
&s;eemed perfectly, though not &s;ervilely, to
acknowledge his &s;uperiority.</P>
<P>During dinner, the conver&s;ation was
chiefly on war and politics. They talked
with energy of the &s;tate of Venice,. its dan|gers,
<PB N="403" REF="405">
the character of the reigning Doge
and of the chief &s;enators; and then &s;poke
of the &s;tate of Rome. When the repa&s;t
was over, they ro&s;e, and, each filling his
goblet with wine from the gilded ewer, that
exploits!&endq; Montoni was lifting his gob|let
to his lips to drink this toa&s;t, when &s;ud|denly
teh wine hi&s;&s;ed, ro&s;e to the brim,
and, as he held the gla&s;s from him, it bur&s;t
into a thou&s;and pieces</P>
<P>To him, who con&s;tantly u&s;ed that fort of
Venice gla&s;e, which had the quality of
breaking, upon receiving poi&s;oned liquor,
a &s;u&s;picion, that &s;ome of his gue&s;ts had
endeavoured to betray him, in&s;tantly oc|curred,
and he ordered all the gates to be
clo&s;ed, drew his &s;word, and, lookign round
on them, who &s;tood in &s;ilent amazement,
exlaimed, &startq;Here is a traitor among us;
let tho&s;e, that are innocent, a&s;&s;i&s;t in di&s;|covering
the guilty.&endq;</P>
<P>Indignation fla&s;hed from the eyes of the
cavaliers, who all drew their &s;words; and
<PB N="404" REF="406">
Madame Montoni, terrified at what might
en&s;ue, was ha&s;tenign from the hall, when
her hu&s;band commanded her to &s;tay; but
his further woeds could not now be di&s;ting|ui&s;hed
fro the voice of every per&s;on ro&s;e
together. His order, that all the &s;ervants
&s;hould appear, was at length obeyed, and
they declared their ignoraance of any deceit
a prote&s;tation which could not be believed;
for it was evident, that, a sMontoni's
liquor, and his only, had been poi&s;oned, a
deliberate de&s;ign had been formed again&s;t
his life, which could not have been carried
&s;o fare towards its accompli&s;h;emtn, without
the connivance of the &s;ervatn, who had the
care of the wine ewers.</P>
<P>This man, with another, who&s;e face be|trayed
either the con&s;ciou&s;nes&s;s of guilt, or
the fear of puni&s;hemtn, Montoni ordered to
be chained in&s;tantly, and confined in a
&s;trong room, which had romerly been u&s;ed
as a pri&s;on. Thither, likewi&s;e, he would
have &s;ent all his gue&s;ts, had he not fore&s;een
the con&s;equence of &s;o bold and unju&s;ti&s;iable
<PB N="405" REF="407">
a proceeding. As to tho&s;e, therefore, he
contented him&s;elf with &s;wearing, that no
man &s;hould pa&s;s the gates, till this extraor|dinary
affair had been inve&s;tigated, and
then &s;ternly bade his wife retire to her
apartment, whither he &s;uffered Emily to
attend her.</P>
<P>In about half an hour, he followed to
the dre&s;&s;ing-room; and Emily ob&s;erved,
with horror, his dark countenance and qui|vering
lip, and heard him denounce ven|geance
on her aunt.</P>
<P>&startq;It will avail you nothing,&endq; &s;aid he to
his wife, &startq;to deny the fact; I have proof
of your guilt. Your only chance of mercy
re&s;ts on a full ocn&s;e&s;&s;ion;&mdash;there is nothing
to hope from &s;ullenne&s;s, or fal&s;ehood; your
accomplice has confe&s;&s;ed all.&endq;</P>
<P>Emily's fainting &s;pirits were rou&s;ed by
a&s;toni&s;hment, as &s;he heard her aunt accu&s;ed
of a crime &s;o atrocious, and &s;he could not,
for a moment, admit the po&s;&s;ibility of her
guilt. Meanwhile Madame Montoni's agi|tation
did not permit her to reply; alter|nately
<PB N="406" REF="408">
her complexion varied from livid
palene&s;s to a crim&s;on flu&s;h; adn &s;he trem|bled
but, whether with fear, or with in|dignation,
it were difficult to decide.</P>
<P>&startq;Spared your words,&endq; &s;aid Montoni, &s;eeing
her about to &s;peak, &startq;your countenance
makes full con&s;e&s;&s;ion of your crime.-You
&s;hall be in&s;tantly removed to the ea&s;t turret.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;This accu&s;ation,&endq; &s;aid Madme Mont|oni,
&s;peaking with difficulty, &startq;is u&s;ed on|ly
as an excu&s;e for your cruelty; I di&s;dain
to reply to it. You do not believe me
guilty.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Signor!&endq; &s;aid Emily &s;olemnly, &startq;this
dreadful cahrge, I would an&s;wer with my
life, is fal&s;e. Nay, Signor,&endq; &s;he added, ob|&s;erving
the &s;erity of his countenance,
&startq;this is no moment for re&s;traint, on my
part; I do not &s;cruple to tell you, that
by the &s;ugge&s;tion of &s;ome per&s;on, who aims
at the ruin of my aunt:-it is impo&s;&s;ible,
that you could your&s;elf hav eimagined a
crime &s;o hideous.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="407" REF="409">
Montoni, his lips trembling more than
before, replied only, &startq;If you value your
own &s;afety,&endq; addre&s;sing Emily, &startq;you will
be filent I shall know how to interpret
your remon&s;trances, &s;hould you per&s;erve
in them.&endq;</P>
<P>Emily rai&s;ed her eyes calmly to heaven
&startq;Here is, indeed, then, nothiong to hope!&endq;
said &s;he.</P>
<P>&startq;Peace!&endq; cried Montoni, &startq;or your &s;hall
find there is &s;omething to fear.&endq;</P>
<P>He turned tohis wife, who had now re|covered
her &s;pirits, and who vehemently
and widly remon&s;trated upon this my&s;te|rious
&s;u&s;picion: but Montoni's rage height|ened
with her indignation, and Emily,
dreading the event of it, threw her&s;elf be|tween
them, and cla&s;ped his knees in &s;ilence
looking up in his face with an expre&s;&s;ion,
that might have softened the heart of a
fiend. Whether his was hardened by a
conviction of Madame Montoni's guilt, or
that a bare &s;u&s;picion of it made him eager
to exercise vengeanace, he was totally and
<PB N="408" REF="410">
alike in&s;en&s;ible to the di&s;tre&s;s of his wife,
and to the pleading looks of Eamnily, whom
he made no attempt to rai&s;e, but was vehe|mently
menacing both, when he was called
out of the room by &s;ome per&s;on at the door.
As he &s;hut the door, Emily heard his turn
the lock and take out the key; so that
Madame Montoni and her&s;elf were now
pri&s;oners; and &s;he saw that his de&s;igns be|came
more and more terrible. Her endea|ours
to explain his motives for this circum&s;tance
were almo&s;t as ine&s;&s;ectual as
tho&s;e to &s;ooth the di&s;tre&s;s of her aunt,
whose innocence &s;he could not doubt;
but &s;he, at length, accounted for Montoni's
readine&s;s to &s;u&s;pect his hiw own con|&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s
of cruelty towards her, and for
the &s;udden violence of his pre&s;ent conduct
again&s;st both, before even his &s;u&s;picions
could be completely formed, by this general
eagerne&s;s to effect &s;uddenly whatever he
was led to de&s;ire and his carele&s;&s;ne&s;s of ju&s;tice,
or humanity, in accompli&s;hing it.</P>
<P>Madame Montoni, after &s;ome time, again
<PB N="409" REF="411">
looked round, in &s;earch of a po&s;&s;ibility of
e&s;cape from the ca&s;tle, and conver&s;ed with
Emily on the &s;ubject, who was now willing
to encounter any hazard, though &s;he forbore
to encourage a hope in her aunt, which
she her&s;elf did not admit. How &s;trongly
the edi&s;ice was &s;ecured, and how vigilantly
guarded, &s;he knew too well; and trembled
to commit their &s;afety t the caprice of the
&s;ervant, who&s;e a&s;&s;istance they mu&s;t solicit.
Old Carlo was compa&s;&s;ionate, but he &s;eemed
to be too much in his ma&s;ter's intere&s;t to
be tru&s;ted by them; Annette could of her
&s;elf do little, and Emily knew Ludovico
only from her report. At present, how|ever,
the&s;e con&s;iderations were u&s;ele&s;s, Ma|dame
Montoni and her niece being &s;hut up
from all intercour&s;e, even with the per&s;ons,
whom there might be the&s;e rea&s;ons to
reject.</P>
<P>In the hall, confu&s;sion and tumult &s;till
resigned. Emily, as &s;he li&s;tened anxiou&s;ly
to the murmur, that sounded along the
<PB N="410" REF="412">
gallery, &s;ometimes fancied &s;he heard the
cla&s;hing of &s;words, and, when &s;he con&s;idered
the nature of the provocation, given by
Montoni, and his impetuo&s;ity, it appeared
probable, that nothing le&s;s than arms would
terminate the contention. Madame Mon|toni,
having exhausted all her expre&s;&s;ions
of indignation, and Emily, hers of comfort,
they remained silent, in that kind of breath|less
&s;tillne&s;&s;, which, in nature, often &s;uc|ceeds
to the uproar of conflicting elements;
a &s;tillne&s;s, like the morning, that dawns
upon the ruins of an earthquake.</P>
<P>An uncertain kind of terror pervaded
Emily's mind; the circum&s;tances of the
pa&s;t hour &s;till came dimly and confu&s;edly
to her memory; and her thoughts were
various and rapid, though without tu|mult.</P>
<P>From this &s;tate of waking vi&s;ions &s;he was
recalled by a knocking at the chamber|door,
and, enquiring who was there, heard
the whi&s;pering voice of Annette.</P>
<P><PB N="411" REF="413">
&startq;Dear madam, let me come in, I have a
great deal to &s;ay,&endq; &s;aid the poor girl.</P>
<P>&startq;The door is locked,&endq; an&s;ered her lady.</P>
<P>&startq;Yes, ma'am, but do pray open it.&endq;
&startq;The Signor has the key,&endq; &s;aid Madame Montoni.</P>
<P>&startq;O ble&s;&s;ed Virgin! What will become of us?&endq; exclaimed Annette.</P>
<P>&startq;&s;&s;ift us to e&s;cape,&endq; &s;aid her mi&s;tre&s;s.
&startq;Where is Ludovico?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Below in the hall, ma'am among&s;t
them all, fighting with the be&s;t of them!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Fighting! Who are fighting? Cried
Madame Montoni.</P>
<P>&startq;Why the Signor, m'am, and all the
Signors, and a great many more.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Is any per&s;on much hurt?&endq; &s;aid Emily,
in tremulous voice.&startq;Hurt! Yes, ma'am&s;elle,
&mdash;there they lie bleeding, and the
&s;words are cla&s;hing, and&mdash;O holy &s;aints!
Do let me in, ma'am, they are coming this
Way&mdash;I &s;hall be murdered!&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="412" REF="414">
&startq;Fly!&endq; cried Emily, &startq;fly! We cannot
open the door.&endq;</P>
<P>Annette repeated, that they were coming,
And in the &s;ame moment &s;led.</P>
<P>&startq;Be clam madam,&endq; &s;aid Emily,turning
to her aunt, &startq;I entreat you be calm, I am
not frightened&mdash;not frightened in the lea&s;t,
do not you be alrmed.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;You can &s;carcely &s;upport your&s;elf,&endq; re|plied
her aunt; &startq;Merciful God! What is
it they mean to do with us?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;They come perhaps to liberate us,&endq;
&s;aid Emily, &startq;Signor Montoni perhaps is&mdash;
is conquered.&endq;</P>
<P>The belief of his death gave her &s;pirits a
&s;udden &s;hock, and &s;he grew &s;aint as &s;he &s;aw
him inimagination, expiring at her feet.</P>
<P>&startq;They are coming!&endq; cried Madame
Montoni&mdash;&startq;I hear their step&mdash;they are at
the door!&endq;</P>
<P>Emily turned her languid eyes to the
door, but terror deprived her of utterance.
The key &s;ounded in the lock; the door
<PB N="413" REF="415">
opened, and Montoni appeared, followed
by three ru&s;&s;ian like men. &startq;Execuse your
orders,&endq; &s;aid he, turning to them, and
pointing to his wife, who &s;hrieked, but was
immediately carried from the room; while
Emily &s;hunk, &s;en&s;ele&s;s, on a couch by which
&s;he had endeavoured to &s;upport her&s;elf.
When &s;he recovered, &s;he was alone, and re|collected
only, that Madame Montoni had
been there, together with &s;ome unconnected
particulars of the preceding tran&s;cation,
which were, however, &s;ufficient ot renew
all her terror She looked wildly round
the apartment, as if in &s;earch of &s;ome means
of intelligence, concerning her aunt, while
neither her own danger, of an idea of
e&s;caping from the room, immediately oc|curred.</P>
<P>When her recollection was more com|plete,
&s;he rai&s;ed her&s;elf and went, but with
only a faint hope, to examine whether the
door was unfa&s;tened. It was &s;o, and &s;he
then &s;tepped timidly our into the gallery,
but pau&s;ed there, uncertain which way &s;he
<PB N="414" REF="416">
&s;hould proceed. Her fir&s;t wi&s;h was to ga|ther
&s;ome information, as to her aunt, and
&s;he, at length, turned her &s;teps to go to the
li&s;&s;er hall, where Annette and the other &s;er|vants
u&s;ually waited.</P>
<P>Every where, as &s;he pa&s;&s;ed, &s;he heard,
from a di&s;tant, the uproar of contention,
and the figures and faces, which &s;he met,
hurrying along the pa&s;&s;age, &s;truck her mind
with di&s;may. Emily might now have ap|peared,
like an angel of light, encompa&s;&s;ed
by fiends. At length, &s;he reached the la&s;&s;er
hall, which was &s;ilent and de&s;erted, but,
panting for breath, &s;he &s;at down to recover
her&s;elf. The total &s;tillne&s;s of this place was
as awful as the tumult, from which &s;he had
e&s;caped; but &s;he had now time to recall
her &s;cattered thoughts, to remember her per|&s;onal
danger, and to con&s;ider of &s;ome means
of &s;afety. She perceived, that it was u&s;e|le&s;s
to &s;eek Madame Montoni, through the
wide extent and intricacies of the ca&s;tle,
not, too, when every avenue &s;eemed to be
be&s;et by ru&s;&s;ians; in this hall &s;he could not
<PB N="415" REF="417">
re&s;olve to &s;tay, for &s;he knew not how &s;oon
it might become their place of rendezvous;
and, though &s;he wi&s;hed to go to her cham|ber,
&s;he dreaded again to encounter them on
the way.</P>
<P>Thus &s;he fat, trembling and he&s;itating,
when a di&s;tant murmur broke on the &s;ilence,
and grew louder and louder, till &s;he di&s;tin|gui&s;hed
voices and &s;tep approaching. She
then ro&s;e to go, but the &s;ound came along
the only pa&s;&s;age, by which &s;he could de|part,
and &s;he was compelled to await in the
hall, the arrival of the per&s;on, who&s;e &s;teps
&s;he heard. As the&s;e advanced, &s;he di&s;tingui&s;hed
groans, and then &s;aw a man borne
&s;lowly along by four other. Her &s;pirits
faltered at the &s;ight, and &s;he leaned again&s;t
the wall for &s;upport. The bearers,mean|while,
entered the hall, and, being too bu|&s;ily
occupied to detain, or even notice
Emily, &s;he attempted to leave it, but her
&s;trength failed, and &s;he again &s;at down on
the bench. A damp chillne&s;s came over
her; her &s;ight became confu&s;ed; &s;he knew
<PB N="416" REF="418">
not what had pa&s;&s;ed, or where &s;he was, yet
the groans of the wounded per&s;on &s;till vi|brated
on her heart. In a few moments,
the tide of life &s;eemed again to flow; &s;he
began to breath more freely, and her &s;en&s;es
revived. She had not fainted, nor had ever
totally lo&s;t her con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s, but had con|trived
to &s;upport her&s;elf on the bench; &s;till
without courage to turn her eyes upon the
unfortunate object, which remained near
her, and about whom the men were yet too
much engaged to attend to her.</P>
<P>When her &s;trength returned, &s;he ro&s;e, and
was &s;uffered to leave the hall, though her
anxiety, having produced &s;ome vain en|quiries,
concerning Madame Montoni, had
thus made a di&s;covery of her&s;elf. Towards
her chamber &s;he now ha&s;tened, as fa&s;t as
her &s;teps would bear her, for &s;he &s;till per|ceived,
upon her pa&s;&s;age, the &s;ounds of
confu&s;ion at a di&s;tance, and &s;he endea|voured,
by taking her way through &s;ome
ob&s;cure rooms, to avoide encoutenring the
per&s;on, who&s;e looks had terrified her be|fore,
<PB N="417" REF="419">
as well as tho&s;e parts of the ca&s;tle,
where the tumult might &s;till rage.</P>
<P>At length, &s;he reached her chamber, and,
having &s;ecured the door of the corridor,
felt her&s;elf, for a moment, in &s;afety. A
profound &s;tillne&s;s reigned in this remote
apartment, which not even the faint mur|mur
of the mo&s;t di&s;tant &s;ounds now reached.
She &s;at down, near one of the ca&s;ements,
and, as &s;he gazed on the mountain-view
beyond, the deep repo&s;e of its beauty &s;truck
her with all the force of contra&s;t, and &s;he
could &s;carcely believe her&s;elf &s;o near a &s;cene
of &s;avage di&s;ord. The contending ele|ments
&s;eemed to have retired from their
natural &s;pheres, and to have collected them|&s;elves
into the minds of men, for there along
the tempe&s;t now reigned.</P>
<P>Emily tried to tranquillize her &s;pirits, but
anxiety made her con&s;tantly li&s;ten for &s;ome
found, and often look out upon the ram|parts,
where all, however, was lonely and
&s;till., As a &s;en&s;e of her own immediate
danger had decrea&s;ed, her apprehen&s;ion con|cerning
<PB N="418" REF="420">
Madme Montoni heightened, who
&s;he remembered, had been &s;iercely threat|ened
with con&s;inement in the ea&s;t turret,
and it was po&s;&s;ible, that her hu&s;band had
&s;atisfied his pre&s;ent vengeance with this
puni&s;hment. She, therefore, determined,
when night &s;hould return, and the inhabit|ants
of the ca&s;tle &s;hould be a&s;leep, to ex|plore
the way to the turret, which, as the
direction it &s;tood in was mentioned, ap|peared
not very difficult to be done. She
knew, indeed, that although her aunt might
be there, &s;he could afford her no effectual
a&s;&s;i&s;tance, but it might give her &s;ome com|fort
even to know, that &s;he was di&s;covered,
and to herar the &s;ound of her niece's voice;
for her&s;elf, any certainty, concerning Ma|dame
Montoni's fate, appeared more tole|rable,
than this exhau&s;ting &s;u&s;pen&s;e.</P>
<P>Meanwhile, Annette did not appear, and
Emily was &s;urpri&s;ed, and &s;omewhat alarmed
for her, whom, in the confu&s;ion of the late
&s;cene, various accidents might have befall|len
and it was improbable, that &s;he would
<PB N="419" REF="421">
have failed to come to her apartment, un|le&s;s
&s;omething unfortunate had happened.</P>
<P>Thus the hours pa&s;&s;ed in &s;olitude, in
&s;ilence, and in anxious conjecturing. Be|ing
not once di&s;turbed by a me&s;&s;age, or
a &s;ound, it appeared,that Montoni had
wholly forgotten her, and it gave her &s;ome
comfort to find, that &s;he could be &s;o unno|ticed.
She endeavoured to withdraw her
thoughts from the anxiety, that preyed upon
them, but they refu&s;ed contruoul; &s;he could
neither read, or draw, and the tones of her
lute were &s;o utterly di&s;cordant with the
pre&s;ent &s;tate of her feelings, that &s;he could
not endure them for a moment.</P>
<P>The &s;un, at length, &s;et behind the we&s;t|ern
mountains; his &s;iery beams faded from
the clouds, and then a dun melancholy
purple drew over them, and gradually in|volved
the features of the country below.
Soon after, the &s;entinels pa&s;&s;ed on the ram|part
to commence the watch.</P>
<P>Twilight had now &s;pread its gloom over
every object; the di&s;mal ob&s;curity of her
<PB N="420" REF="422">
chamber recalled fearful thoughts, but &s;he
remembered, that to procure a light &s;he
mu&s;t pa&s;s through a great extent of the
ca&s;tle, and above all, through the halls,
where &s;he had already experienced &s;o much
horror. Darken&s;s, indeed, in the pre|&s;ent
&s;tate of her &s;pirits,made &s;ilence and
&s;olitude terrible to her; it would al&s;o
prevent the po&s;&s;ibility of her finding her
way to the turret, and condemn her to
remain in &s;u&s;pen&s;e, concerning the fate of
her aunt; yet &s;he dared not to venture forth
for a lamp.</P>
<P>Continuing at the ca&s;ement, that &s;he
might catch the la&s;t lingering gleam of
evening, a thou&s;and vague images of fear
floated on her fancy. &startq;what if &s;ome of
the&s;e ru&s;&s;ians,&endq; &s;aid &s;he, &startq;&s;hould find out
the private &s;tair ca&s;e, and in the darken&s;s of
night &s;teal into my chamber!&endq; Then, re|collecting
the my&s;terious inhabitant of the
neighbouring apartment, her terror changed
its object &startq;He is not a pri&s;oner,&endq; &s;aid
&s;he, &startq;though he remains in one chamber
<PB N="421" REF="423">
for Montoni did not fa&s;ten the door, when
he left it; the unknown per&s;on him&s;elf did
this; it is certain, therefore,he can come
out when he plea&s;es.&endq;</P>
<P>She paused, for, notwith&s;tanding the ter|rors
of darken&s;s, &s;he con&s;idered it to be
very improbable, whoever he was, that he
could have any intere&s;t in intruding upon
her retirement; and again the &s;ubject of
her emotion changed, when, remembering
her nearne&s;sto the chamber, wher the veil
had formerly di&s;clo&s;ed a dreadful &s;pectacle,
&s;he doubted whether &s;ome pa&s;&s;age might
not communicate between it and the in&s;e|cure
door of the &s;taire ca&s;e.</P>
<P>It was now entirely dark, and &s;he left the
ca&s;ement. As &s;he fat with her eyes fixed
on the hearth, &s;he thought &s;he perceived
there a &s;park of light; it twinkled and di&s;|appeared,
and then again was vi&s;ible. At
length, with much care, &s;he fanned the
embers of a wood fire, that had been light|ed
in the morning, into flame, and having
communicated it to lamp, which always
<PB N="422" REF="424">
&s;tood in her room, felt a &s;ati&s;faction not to
be conceived, without a review of her &s;itua|tion.
Her fir&s;t care was to guard to the door
of the flaire-ca&s;e, for which purpo&s;e &s;he
placed again&s;t it all the furniture &s;he could
move, and &s;he was thus employed, for &s;ome
time, at the end of which &s;he had another
in&s;tance how much more oppre&s;&s;ive misfor|tune
is to the idle, than to the bu&s;y; for,
having then lei&s;ure to think over all the
circum&s;tances of her pre&s;ent afflictions, &s;he
imagined a thou&s;and evils for futurity, and
the&s;e real and ideal &s;ubjects of di&s;tre&s;s alike
wounded her mind.</P>
<P>Thus heavily moved the hours till mid|Night,
when &s;he counted the &s;ulled notes of
The great clock, as they rolled along the
rampart, unmmngled with any &s;ound, except
the di&s;tant foot-fall of a &s;entinel, who
came to relieve guard. She now thought
&s;he might venture towards the turret, and
having gently opened the chamber door to
examine the corridor, and to li&s;ten if any
per&s;on was &s;tirring in the ca&s;tle, found all
<PB N="423" REF="425">
around in perfect &s;tillne&s;s. Yet no &s;ooner
had &s;he left the room, than, &s;he perceived a
light fla&s;h on the walkls of the corridor,
and, without waiting to &s;ee by whom it was
carried, &s;he &s;hrunk back, and clo&s;ed her
door. No one approaching, &s;he conjectured,
that it was Montoni going to pay his mid|night
vi&s;it to her unknown neighbour, and
&s;he determined to wait, till he &s;hould have
retired to his own apartment.</P>
<P>When the chimes had tolled another half
hour, &s;he once more opened the door, and,
perceiving that no per&s;on was in the corri
dor,ha&s;tily cro&s;&s;ed into a pa&s;&s;age, that led
along the fouth &s;ide of the ca&s;tle towards
the &s;tair-ca&s;e, whence &s;he believed &s;he could
ea&s;ily find her way to the turret. Often
pau&s;ing on her way, li&s;tening apprehen|&s;ively
to the murmurs of the wind, and
looking fearfully onward into the gloom of
the long pa&s;&s;ages, &s;he, at length, reached
the &s;tair-ca&s;e; but there her perplexity be|gen.
Two pa&s;&s;ages appeared, of which &s;he
knew not how to prefer one, and was com|pelled,
<PB N="424" REF="426">
at la&s;t, to decide by chance, ra|ther
than by circum&s;tances. That &s;he en|tered,
opened fir&s;t into a wide gallery, along
which &s;he pa&s;&s;ed lightly and &s;wiftly; for
the lonely a&s;pect of the place awed her, and
&s;he &s;tarted at the echo of her own &s;teps.</P>
<P>On a &s;udden, &s;he thought &s;he heard a
voice, and, not di&s;tingui&s;hing from whence
it came, feared equally to proceed, or to
return. For &s;ome moments, &s;he &s;tood in an
attitude of li&s;tening expectation, &s;hriking
almo&s;t from her&s;elf and &s;carcely daring to
look round her. The voice came again, but,
thought it was now near her, terror did not al|low
her to judge exactly whence it proceeded.
She tought, however, that it was the voice
of complaint, and her belief was &s;oon con|firmed
by a low moaning &s;ound, that &s;eemed
to proceed from one of the chambers, open|ing
into the gallery. It in&s;tantly occurred
to her, that Madame Montoni might be
there confined, and &s;he advanced to the
door to &s;peak, but was checked by con&s;i
dering, that &s;he was, perhaps, going to com|mit
<PB N="425" REF="427">
her&s;elf to a &s;tranger, who might di&s;co|ver
her to Montoni; for, though this per|&s;on,
whoever it was, &s;eemed to be in afflic|tion,
it did not follow, that he was a pri|&s;oner.</P>
<P>While the&s;e thoughts pa&s;&s;ed over her mind,
and left her &s;till in her&s;itation, the voice
&s;poke again, and, calling &startq;Ludovico,&endq; &s;he
then perceived it to be that of Annette; on
which, no longer he&s;itating, &s;he went in joy
to an&s;wer her.</P>
<P>&startq;Ludovico!&endq; cried Annette, &s;obbing&mdash;
&startq;Ludovico!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;It is I,&endq; &s;aid Emily, trying to open the
door. &startq;How came you here? Who &s;hut
you up?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Ludovico!&endq; repeated Annette
&mdash;&startq;O Ludovico!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;It is not Ludovico, it is I&mdash;Mademoi|felle
Emily.&endq;</P>
<P>Annette cea&s;ed &s;obbing, and was &s;ilent.
&startq;If you can open the door, let me in,&endq;
&s;aid Emily, &startq;here is no per&s;on to hurt
you.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="426" REF="428">
&startq;Ludovico!&mdash;O, Ludovico!&endq; cried
Annette.</P>
<P>Emily now lo&s;t her patience, and, her
fear of being overheard increa&s;ing, &s;he was
even nearly about to leave the door, when
&s;he con&s;idered, that Annette might,po&s;&s;I|bly,
know &s;omething of the &s;ituation of
Madame Montoni, or direct her to the tur|ret.
At length, &s;he obtained a reply, though
little &s;atisfactory, to her que&s;tions, for An|nette
knew nothing of Madame Montoni,
and only conjured Emily to tell her what
was become of Ludovico. Of him &s;he had
no information to give, and &s;he again a&s;ked
who had &s;hut Annette up.</P>
<P>&startq;Ludovico,&endq; &s;aid the poor girl, &startq;Ludo|vico
&s;hut me up, when I ran away from
the dre&s;&s;ing -room door to-day, I went I
&s;carcely knew where, for &s;afety; and, in
this gallery, here, i met Ludovic, who
hurried me into this chamber, and locked
me up to keep me out of harm, as he &s;aid.
But he was in &s;uch a hurry him&s;elf, he
hardly;&s;poke ten words, but he told me he
<PB N="427" REF="429">
would come, and let me out, when all was
quiet, and he took away the key with him.
Now all the&s;e hours are pa&s;&s;ed, and I have
neither &s;een, or heard a word of him; they
have murdered him&mdash;I know they have!&startq;</P>
<P>Emily &s;uddenly remembered the wounded
per&s;on, whom &s;he had &s;een borne into the
&s;ervants' hall, and &s;he &s;carcely doubted, that
he was Ludovico, but &s;he concealed the
circum&s;tance from Annette, and endea|voured
to comfort her.Then, impatient
to learn &s;omething of her aunt, &s;he again
enquired the way to the turret.</P>
<P>&startq;O! you are not going, ma'am&s;elle,&endq;
&s;aid Annette, &startq;for Heaven's fake, do not
go, and leave me here by my&s;elf.&endq;
&startq;Nay, Annette, you do not think I can
wait in the gallery all night,&endq;replied Emily.
&startq;Direct me to the turret; in the morning
I will endeavour to relea&s;e you.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;O holy Mary!&endq; exclaimed Annette,
&startq;am I to &s;tay here by my&s;elf all night! I
&s;hall be frightened out of my &s;en&s;es, and I
&s;hall die of hunger; I have had nothing to
eat &s;ince dinner!&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="428" REF="430">
Emily could &s;carcely forbear &s;miling at
the heterogeneous di&s;tre&s;&s;es of Annette,
though &s;he &s;incerely pitied them, and &s;aid
what &s;he &s;incerely pitied them, and &s;aid
what &s;he could to &s;ooth her. At length,
&s;he obtained &s;omething like a direction to
the ea&s;t turret, and quitted the door, from
whence, after many intricacies and perplexi|ties,
&s;he reached the &s;teep and winding &s;tairs
of the turret, at the foot of which &s;he &s;topped
to re&s;st, and to re-animate her courage with a
&s;en&s;e of her duty. As &s;he furveyed this di&s;|mal
place, &s;he perceived a door on the oppo|&s;ite
&s;ide of the &s;tair-ca&s;e, and, anxious to know
whether it would lead her to Madame Mon|toni,
&s;tried to undrw the bolts, which
fa&s;tened it. Afre&s;her air came to her face, as
&s;he unclo&s;ed the door, which opened upon
the ea&s;st rampart, and the &s;udden current had
nearly extingui&s;hed her light, which &s;he now
removed to a di&s;tance; and again, looking out
upon the ob&s;cure terrace, &s;he perceived only
the faint outline of the walls and of &s;ome
towers, while, above, heavy clouds, borne
along the wind, &s;eemed to mingle with the
<PB N="429" REF="431">
&s;tars, and wrap the night in thicker dark|ne&s;s.
As &s;he gazed, now willing to defer
the moment of certainty, from which &s;he
expected only confirmation of evil, a di&s;tant
foot&s;tep reminded her, that &s;he might be
ob&s;erved by the men on watch, and ha&s;tily
clo&s;ing the door, &s;he took her lamp, and
pa&s;&s;ed up the &s;tair-ca&s;e. Termbling came
upon her, as &s;he a&s;cended through the
gloom. To her melancholy fancy this
&s;eemed to be a place of death, and the chill|ing
&s;ilence, that reigned, confirmed its cha|racter.
her &s;pirits faltered. &startq;Perhaps,&endq;
&s;aid &s;he, &startq;I am come hither only to
learn dreadful truth, or to witne&s;s &s;ome
horrible &s;pectacle; i feel that my &s;en&s;es
would not &s;uvive &s;uch and addition of
horror.&endq;</P>
<P>The image of her aunt murdered&mdash;mur|dered,
perhaps, by the had of Montoni,
ro&s;e to her mind; &s;he trembled, ga&s;ped for
breath&mdash;repented that &s;he had dared to ven|ture
hither, and checked her &s;teps. But, af|ter
&s;he had paufed a few minutes, the con&s;ci|ou&s;ne&s;s
<PB N="430" REF="432">
of her duty returned, and &s;he went
on. Still all was &s;ilent. At length a track
of blood, upon a &s;tair, cought her eye; and
in&s;tantly &s;he perceived, that he wall and &s;e|veral
other &s;teps were &s;tained. She pau&s;ed,
again &s;truggled to &s;upport her&s;elf, and the
lamp almo&s;t fell from her trembling hand.
Still no found was heard, no living being
&s;eemed to inhabit the turret; a thou&s;and
times &s;he wi&s;hed her&s;elf again in her cham|ber;
dreaded to enquire farther&mdash;dreaded to
encounter &s;ome horrible &s;pectacle, and yet
could not re&s;olve, now that &s;he was &s;o near
the termination of her efforts, to de&s;i&s;t from
them. Having again recollected courage
to proceed, after a&s;cending about half way
up the turret, &s;he came to another door,
but here again &s;he &s;topped in he&s;itation;
li&s;tened for &s;ounds within, and then, &s;um|moning
all her re&s;olution, unclo&s;ed it, and
entered a chamber, which, as her lamp &s;hot
its feeble rays through the darken&s;s, &s;eemed
to exhibit only dew-&s;tained and de&s;erted
walls. As &s;he &s;tood examining it, in fearful
<PB N="431" REF="433">
expectation of di&s;covering the remains of
her unfortunate aunt, &s;he perceived &s;ome|thing
lying in an ob&s;cure corner of the
room, and, &s;truck with an horribleconvic|tion,
&s;he became, for an in&s;tant, motionle&s;s
and nearly in&s;en&s;ible. Then, with a kind
of de&s;perate e&s;olution &s;he hurried towards
the object that excited her terror, when,
perceiving the clothes of &s;ome per&s;on, on
the floor, &s;he caught hold of them, and
found in her gra&s;p the old uniform of a
&s;oldier, beneath which appeared a heap of
pikes and other arms. scarcely daring to
tru&s;t her &s;ight, &s;he continued, for &s;ome mo|ments,
to gaze on the object of her late
alarm, and then left the chamber, &s;o much
comforted and occupied by the conviction,
that hjer aunt was not there, that &s;he was
going to de&s;cend the turret, without enquir|ing
farther; when, on turning to do &s;o,
&s;he ob&s;erved upon &s;ome &s;teps on the &s;econd
flight an appearance of blood, and remem|bering,
that there was yet another chamber
to be explored, &s;he again followed the
<PB N="432" REF="434">
windings of the a&s;cent. Still, as &s;he a&s;|cended,
the track of blood glared upon the
&s;tairs.</P>
<P>It led her to the door of a landing place,
that terminated them, but &s;he was unable
to follow it farther. Now that &s;he was &s;o
near the fought-for certainty, &s;he dreaded
to know it, even more than before, and had
not fortitude &s;ufficient to &s;peak, or to at|tempt
opening the door.</P>
<P>Having li&s;tened, in vain, for &s;ome &s;ound,
that might confirm, or de&s;troy her fears,
&s;he, at length, laid her hand on the lock,
and, finding it fa&s;tened, called on Madame
Montoni; but only a chilling &s;ilence en|&s;ued.</P>
<P>&startq;She is dead!&endq; &s;he cried,&mdash;&startq;murdered!
&mdash;her blood is on the &s;tairs!</P>
<P>Emily grew very faint; could &s;upport
her&s;elf no longer, and had &s;carcely pre&s;ence
of mind to &s;et down the lamp, and place
her&s;elf on a &s;tep</P>
<P>When her recollection returned, &s;he &s;poke
again at the door, and again attempted to
<PB N="433" REF="435">
open it, and, having lingered for &s;ome time,
without receiving any an&s;wer, or hearing a
&s;ound, &s;he de&s;cended the turret, and, with
all the &s;wiftne&s;s her feeblene&s;s would per|mit,
fought her own apartment.</P>
<P>As &s;he turned into the corridor, the door
of a chamber opened, form whence Mon|toni
came forth; but Emily, more terrified
than ever to behold him, &s;hrunk back into
the pa&s;&s;age &s;oon enough to e&s;cape being no|ticed,
and heard him clo&s;e the door, which
&s;he had perceived was the &s;ame &s;he formerly
ob&s;erved. Having here li&s;tened to his de|parting
&s;teps, till their faint found was lo&s;t
in di&s;tance, &s;he ventured to her apartment,
and, &s;ecuring it once again, retired to her
bed, leaving the lamp burning on the hearth.
But &s;leep was &s;led from her hara&s;&s;ed mind,
to which images of horror alone occurred.
She endeavoured to think it po&s;&s;ible, that
Madame Montoni had not been taken to
the turret; but, when &s;he recollected the
former meanaces of her hu&s;band and the
terrible &s;pirit of vengeance, which he had
<PB N="434" REF="436">
di&s;played on a late occa&s;ion; when &s;he re|membered
his general character, the looks
of the men, who had forced Madame Mon|toni
from her apartment, and the written
traces on the &s;tairs of the turret&mdash;&s;he could
not doubt, that her aunt had been carried
thither, and could &s;carcely hope, that &s;he
had not been carried to be murdered.
The grey of morning had long dawned
through her ca&s;ements, before Emily cio&s;ed
her eyes in &s;leep; when wearied nature,
at length, yielded her a re&s;pite from &s;uf|fering.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP.XI.</HEAD>
<Q>&startq;Who rears the bloody hand?&endq;
<BIBL>SAYER.</BIBL></Q>
<P>EMILY remained in her chamber, on
the following morning, without receiving
any notice from Montoni, or &s;eeing a hu|man
being, except the armed men, who
fometimes pa&s;&s;ed on the terrace below.
Having ta&s;ted no food &s;ince the dinner of
the preceding day, extreme faintne&s;s made
her feel the nece&s;&s;ity of quitting the a&s;ylum
of her apartment to obtain re&s;re&s;hment, and
&s;he was al&s;o very anxious to procure liberty
for Annette. Willing, however, to defer
venturing forth, as long as po&s;&s;ible, and
con&s;idering, whether &s;he &s;hould apply to
Montoni, or to the compa&s;&s;ion of &s;ome
other per&s;on, her exce&s;&s;ive anxiety concern|ing
<PB N="436" REF="438">
her aunt, at length, overcame her ab|horrence
of his pre&s;ence, and &s;he deter|mined
to go to him, and to entreat, that
he would &s;uffer her to &s;ee Madame Mon|toni.</P>
<P>Meanwhile, it was too certain, from the
ab&s;ence of Annette, that &s;ome accident had
befallen Ludovico, and that &s;he was &s;till in
confinement; Emily, therefore, re&s;olved
al&s;o to vi&s;it the chamber, where &s;he had
&s;poken to her, on the preceding night, and,
if the poor girl was yet there, to inform
Montoni of her &s;ituation.</P>
<P>It was near noon, before &s;he ventured
from her apartment, and went fir&s;t to the
&s;outh gallery, whither &s;he pa&s;&s;ed without
meeting a &s;ingle per&s;on, or hearing a &s;ound,
except, now and then, the echo of a di&s;tant
foot&s;tep.</P>
<P>It was unnece&s;&s;ary to call Annette, who&s;e
lamentations were audible upon the fir&s;t
approach to the gallery, and who, bewail|ing
her own and Ludovico's fate, told
Emily, that &s;he &s;hould certainly be &s;tarved
<PB N="437" REF="439">
to death, if &s;he was not let out immediately.
Emily replied, that &s;he was going to beg
her relea&s;e of Montoni; But the terrors of
hunger now yielded to tho&s;e of the Signor,
and, when Emily left her, &s;he was loudly
entreating, that her place of refuge might
be concealed from him.</P>
<P>As Emily drew near the great hall, the
&s;ounds &s;he heard and the people &s;he met
in the pa&s;&s;ages renewed her alarm. The
latter, however, were peaceable, and did not
interrup her, though they looked earne&s;tly
at her,as &s;he pa&s;&s;ed, and &s;ometimes &s;poke.
On cro&s;&s;ing the hall towards the cedar
room, where Montoni u&s;ually fat, &s;he per|ceived,
on the pavement, fragments of
&s;words, &s;ome tattered garments &s;tained with
blood, and almo&s;t expected to have &s;een
among them a dead body; but from &s;uch
a &s;pectacle &s;he was, at pre&s;ent, &s;pared. As
&s;he approached the room, the &s;ound of &s;e|veral
voices i&s;&s;ued from within, and a dread
of appearing before many &s;trangers, as
well as of irritating Montoni by &s;uch an in|tru&s;ion,
<PB N="438" REF="440">
made her pau&s;e and falter from
ber purpo&s;e. She looked up through the
long arcades of the hall, in &s;earch of a &s;er|vant,
who might bear a me&s;&s;age, but no
one appeared, and the urgency of what &s;he
had to reque&s;t made her &s;till linger near
the door. The voices within were not in
contention, though &s;he di&s;tingui&s;hed tho&s;e
of &s;everal of the gur&s;ts of the preceding
day; but &s;till her re&s;olution failed, when|ever
&s;the would have tapped at the door.
and &s;he had determined to walk in the hall,
till &s;ome per&s;on &s;hould appear, who might
call Montoni from the room, when as &s;he
turned from the door, it was &s;uddenly
opened by him&s;eflf. Emily trembled, and
was con&s;u&s;ed, while he almo&s;t &s;tarted with
&s;urpri&s;e, and all the terrors of his counte|nance
unfolded them&s;elves. She forgot all
&s;he would have &s;aid, and neither enquired
for her aunt, or entreated for Annette, but
&s;tood &s;ilent and embarra&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>After clo&s;ing the door he reproved her for a
meanne&s;s, of which &s;he had not been guilty.
<PB N="439" REF="441">
and &s;ternly que&s;tioned her what &s;he had
overheard; an accu&s;ation, which revived
her recollection &s;o far, that &s;he a&s;&s;ured him
&s;he had not come thither with an intention
to li&s;ten to his conver&s;ation, but to entreat
his compa&s;&s;ion for her aunt, and for An|netre.
Montoni &s;eemed to doubt this a&s;|&s;ertion,
for he regarded her with a &s;cruti|nizing
look; and the doubt evidently aro&s;e
from no trifling intere&s;t. Emily then fur|ther
explained her&s;elf, and concluded with
entreating him to inform her, where her
aunt was placed, and to permit, that &s;he
might vi&s;it her; but he looked upon her
only with a malignant &s;mile, which in&s;tan|taneou&s;ly
confirmed her wor&s;t fears for her
aunt, and, at that moment, &s;he had not
courage to renew her entreaties.</P>
<P>&startq;For Annette,&endq; &s;aid he,&mdash;&startq;if you go
to Carlo, he will relea&s;e the girl; the fooli&s;h
fellow, who &s;hut her up, died yesterday.&endq;
Emily &s;huddered.&mdash;&startq;But my aunt,
Signor&endq;&mdash;&s;aid &s;he, &startq;O tell me of my
aunt!&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="440" REF="442">
&startq;She is taken care of,&endq; replied Montoni
ha&s;tily, &startq;I have no time to an&s;wer idle
que&s;tions.&endq;</P>
<P>He would have pa&s;&s;ed on, but Emily, in
a voice of agony, that could not be wholly
re&s;i&s;ted, conjured him to tell her, where
Madame Montoni was; while he pau&s;ed,
and &s;he anxiou&s;ly watched his counte|nance,
a trumpet &s;ounded, and, in the
next moment, &s;h heard the heavy gates
of the portal open, and then the clattering
of hor&s;es' hoofs in the court, with the con|fu&s;ion
of many voices. She &s;tood for a mo|ment
he&s;tating whether &s;he &s;hould follow
Montoni, who, at the found of the trumpet,
had paffed through the hall, and, running
her eyes whence it came, &s;he &s;aw through
the door, that opened beyond a long per|&s;pective
of arched into the courts, a party
of hor&s;emen, whom &s;he judged,as well as
the di&s;tance and her embarra&s;&s;ment would
allow, to be the &s;ame &s;he had &s;een depart
a few days before. But &s;he &s;aid not to
&s;crutinize, for, when the trumpet &s;ounded
<PB N="441" REF="443">
again, the chevaliers ru&s;hed out of the cedar
room, and men came running into the hall
from every quarter of the ca&s;tle. Emily
once more hurried for &s;helter to her own
apartment. Thither &s;he was &s;till pur&s;ued
by images of horror. She re-con&s;idered
Montoni's manner and words, when he
had &s;poken of his wife, and they &s;erved
only to confirm her mo&s;t terrible &s;u&s;picions.
Tears refu&s;ed any longer to relieve her di&s;|tre&s;s,
and &s;he had &s;at for a con&s;iderrable time
ab&s;orbed in thought, when a knocking at the
chamber door arou&s;ed her, on opening
which &s;he found old Coarlo.</P>
<P>&startq;Dear young lady,&endq; &s;aid he, &startq;I have
been &s;o Hurried, I never once thought of
you till ju&s;t now. I have brought you
&s;ome fruit and wine, and I am &s;ure you
mu&s;t &s;tand in need of them by this
time.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Thank you, Carlo,&endq; &s;aid Emily, &startq;this
is very good of you. Did the Signor re|mind
you of me?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;No, Signora,&endq; replied Carlo, &startq;his
<PB N="442" REF="444">
Excellenza has bu&s;ine&s;s enough on his
hands. Emily then renewed her enqui|ries,
concerning madme Montoni, but
Carlo had been employed at the other end
of the ca&s;tle, during the time, that &s;he was
removed, and he had heard nothing &s;ince,
concerning her.</P>
<P>While he &s;poke, Emily looked &s;teadily at
him, for &s;he &s;carcely knew whether he was
really ignorant, or concealed his knowledge
of the truth from a fear of offending his
ma&s;ter. To &s;erval que&s;tions, concerning
the contentions of ye&s;terday, he gave very
limited an&s;wers; but told, that the di&s;putes
were now amicably &s;ettled, and that the
Signor believed him&s;elf to have been mi&s;|taken
in his &s;u&s;picions of his gue&s;ts. &startq;The
fighting was about that, Signora,&endq; &s;aid
Carlo; &startq;but I tru&s;t I &s;hall never &s;ee &s;uch
another day in this ca&s;tle, though &s;trange
things are about to be done.&endq;</P>
<P>On her enquiring his meaning, &startq;Ah,
Signora!&endq; added he, &startq;it is not for me to
betray &s;ecrets, or tell all I think, but time
will tell.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="443" REF="445">
She then de&s;ired him to relea&s;e Annette,
and, having de&s;cribbed the chamber in
which the poor girl was confined, he pro|mi&s;ed
to obey her immediately, and was
departing, when &s;he remembered to a&s;k
who were the per&s;ons ju&s;t arrived. Her
late conjecture was right; it was Verezzi,
with his party.</P>
<P>Her &s;pirits were &s;mewhat &s;oothed by
this &s;hort conver&s;ation with Carlo; for, in
her pre&s;ent circum&s;tances, it afforded &s;ome
comfort to hear the accents of compa&s;&s;on.
and to meet the look of &s;ympathy.
An hour paffed before Annette appear|ed,
who then came weeping and &s;obbing.
&startq;O Ludovico&mdash;Ludovico!&endq; cried &s;he.</P>
<P>&startq;My poor Annette!&endq; &s;aid Emily, and
made her &s;it down.</P>
<P>&startq;Who could have &s;ore&s;een this, ma'am|&s;elle?
O mi&s;erable, wretched, day&mdash;that
ever I &s;hould live to &s;ee it! and &s;he
continued to moan and lament, till Emily
thought it nece&s;&s;ary to check her exce&s;s
of grief.&endq; We are continually lo&s;ing
<PB N="444" REF="446">
dear friends by death,' &s;aid &s;he with a
&s;igh, that came from her heart. &startq;We mu&s;t
&s;ubmit to the will of Heaven&mdash;our tears,
alas! cannot recall the dead!&endq;</P>
<P>Annette took the handkerchief from her
face.</P>
<P>&startq;You will meet Ludovico in a better
world, I hope,&endq; added Emily.</P>
<P>&startq;yes&mdash;yes,&mdash;ma'am&s;elle,&endq; &s;obbed An|nette,
&startq;but I hope I shall meet him
again in this&mdash;though he is &s;o wounded!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Wounded!&endq; exclaimed Emily, &startq;does
he live?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Yes, ma'am, but&mdash;but he has a ter|rible
wound, and could not come to let
me out. They thought him dead, at fir&s;t,
and he has not been rightly him&s;elf, till
within this hour.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Well Annette, I rejoice to hear he
lives.&endq;</P>
<P>Lives! Holy Saints! why he will not
die, &s;urely!&endq;</P>
<P>Emily &s;aid &s;he hoped not, but this ex|pre&s;&s;on
of hope Annette thought implied
<PB N="445" REF="447">
fear and her own increa&s;ed in proportion,
as Emily endeavoured to encourage her.
To enquiries,concerning Madame Mon|toni,
&s;he could give no &s;atisfactory an|&s;wers.</P>
<P>&startq;I quite forgot to a&s;k among the &s;er|vants,
ma'am&s;elle,&endq; &s;aid &s;he, &startq;for I could
think of nobody but poor Ludovico.&endq;</P>
<P>Annette's grief was now &s;omewhat a&s;|&s;uaged,
and Emily &s;ent her to make en|quiries,
concerning her lady, of whom,
however, &s;he could obtain no intelligence,
&s;ome of the people &s;he &s;poke with being
really ignorant of her fate, and others
having probably received orders to con|ceal
it.</P>
<P>This day pa&s;&s;ed with Emily in con|tinued
grief and anxiety for her aunt; but
&s;he was unmole&s;ted by any notice from
Montoni; and, now that Annette was li|berated,
&s;he obntained food, without ex|po&s;ing
her&s;elf to danger, or impertinence.</P>
<P>Two following days pa&s;&s;ed in the &s;ame
manner, unmarked by any occurrence,
<PB N="446" REF="448">
during which &s;he obtained no information
of Madame Montoni. On the evening of
the &s;econd, having di&s;mi&s;&s;ed Annette, and
retired to bed, her mind became haunted
by the mo&s;t di&s;mal images, &s;uch as her
long anxiety, concerning her aunt, &s;ug|ge&s;ted;
and, unable to forget her&s;elf, for
a moment, or to vanqui&s;h the phantoms,
that tormented her, &s;he ro&s;e from her bed,
and went to one of the ca&s;ements of her
chamber, to breathe a freer air</P>
<P>All without was &s;ilent and dark, unle&s;s
that could be called light, which was only
the faint glimmer of the &s;tars, &s;hewing
imperfectly the outline of the mountains,
the we&s;tern towers of the ca&s;tle and the
ramparts below, where a &s;olitary &s;entinel
was pacing. What an image of repo&s;e
did this &s;cene pre&s;ent! The &s;ierce and
terrible pa&s;&s;ons, too, which &s;o often agi|tated
the inhabitants of this edifice, seemed
now hu&s;hed in &s;leep;&mdash;those my&s;terious
workings, that rou&s;e the elements of man's
nature into tempe&s;t&mdash;were calm. Emily's
<PB N="447" REF="449">
heart was not &s;o but her &s;ufferings, though
deep, partook of the gentle character of
her mind. Hers was a &s;ilent angui&s;h,
weeping, yet enduring; not the wild
energy of passion, inflaming imagination,
bearing down the barriers of rea&s;on and
living in a world of its own.</P>
<P>The air refre&s;hed her, and &s;he con|tinued
at the ca&s;ement, looking on the
&s;hadowy &s;cene, over which the planets
burned with a clear light, amid the deep
blue aether, as they &s;ilently moved in their
de&s;tined cour&s;e. She remembered how
often &s;he had gazed on them with her
dear father, how often he had pointed
out their way in the heavens, and ex|plained
their laws; and the&s;e reflections
led to others, which, in an almo&s;t equal
degree, awakened her grief and a&s;toni&s;h|ment.</P>
<P>They brought a retro&s;pect of all the
&s;trange and mournful events, which had
occurred &s;ince &s;he lived in peace wit her
parents. And to Emily, who had been &s;o
<PB N="448" REF="450">
tenderly educated, &s;o tenderly loved, who
once knew only goodne&s;s and happine&s;s&mdash;
to her, the late late events and her pre&s;ent
&s;ituation&mdash;in a foreign land&mdash;in a remote
ca&s;tle&mdash;&s;urrounded by vice and violence&mdash;
&s;eemed more like the vi&s;ions of a di&s;tem|pered
imagination, thean the circum&s;tances
of truth. She wept to think of what her
parents would have &s;uffered, could they
have fore&s;een the events of her future life.</P>
<P>While &s;he rai&s;ed her &s;treaming eyes to
heaven, &s;he ob&s;erved the &s;ame planet,
which &s;he had &s;een in Languedoc, on the
night, preceding her father's death, ri&s;e
above the ea&s;ten towers of the ca&s;tle,
while &s;he remembered the conver&s;ation,
which had pa&s;&s;ed, concerning the probable
&s;tate of departed &s;ouls; remembered, al&s;o
the &s;olemn mu&s;ic &s;he had heard, and to
which the tenderne&s;s of her &s;pirits had, in
&s;pite of her rea&s;on, given a &s;upper&s;titious
meaning. At the&s;e recollections &s;he wept
again, and continued mu&s;ing when &s;ud|denly
the notes of &s;weet mu&s;ic pa&s;&s;ed on
<PB N="449" REF="451">
the air. A &s;upper&s;titious dread &s;tole over
her; &s;he &s;tood li&s;tening, for &s;ome mo|ments,
in trembling expectation, and then
endeavoured to recollect her thoughts, and
to rea&s;on her&s;elf into compo&s;sure; but hu|man
rea&s;on cannot e&s;tabli&s;h her laws on
&s;ubjects, lo&s;t in the ob&s;curity of imagina|tion,
any more than the eye can a&s;certain
the form of objects, that only glimmer
through the dimne&s;s of night:</P>
<P>Her &s;urpri&s;e, on hearing &s;uch &s;oothing
and delicious &s;ounds, was, at lea&s;t, ju&s;ti&s;|able;
for it was long&mdash;very long, &s;ince &s;he
had liftened to any thing like melody. The fierce trumpet and the &s;hril fife were
the only in&s;truments &s;he had heard, &s;ince
her arrival, at Udolpho.</P>
<P>When her mind was &s;omewhat more
compo&s;ed, &s;he tried to a&s;certain form what
quarter the &s;ounds proceded, and thought
they came from below; but whether from
a room of the ca&s;tle, or from the terrace,
&s;he could not with certainty judge. Fear
and &s;urpri&s;e now yielded to the enhant|ment
<PB N="450" REF="452">
of a &s;train, that floated on the &s;ilent
night, with mo&s;t and melancholy
&s;weetne&s;s. Suddenly, it &s;eemed removed
to a di&s;tance, trembled &s;aintly, and then
entirely cea&s;ed.</P>
<P>She continued to li&s;ten, &s;unk in that
Plea&s;ing repo&s;e, which &s;oft mu&s;ic leaves on
the mind&mdash;but it came no more. Upon
this &s;trange, circumstance her thoughts were
long engaged, for &s;trange it certainly was
to hear mu&s;sic at midnight, when every
inhabitant of the ca&s;tle had long &s;ince re|tired
to re&s;t, and in a place, where nothing
like harmony had been heard before, pro|bably,
for many years. Long-&s;uffering
had made her &s;pirits peculiarly &s;en&s;ible to
terror, and liable to be afected by the il|lu&s;ions
of &s;uper&s;tition.&mdash;It now &s;eemed to
her, as if her dead father had &s;poken to
her that &s;train, to in&s;pire her with com|fort
and confidence, on the &s;ubject, which
had then occupied her mind. Yet rea&s;on
told her, that this was a wild conjecture,
and &s;he was inclined to di&s;mi&s;s it; but,
<PB N="451" REF="453">
with the incon&s;i&s;tency &s;o natural, when
imagination guided the thoughts, &s;he then
wavered towards a belief as wild. She
remembered the &s;ingular even, connected
with the castle, which had given it into
the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of its pre&s;ent owner; and,
when &s;he con&s;idered the my&s;terious man|ner,
in which its late po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or had di&s;ap|peared,
and that &s;he had never &s;ince been
heard of, her mind was impre&s;&s;ed with an
high degree of &s;olemn awe; &s;o that,
though there appeared no clue to connect
that event with the late mu&s;ic, &s;he was
inclined fancifully to think they had &s;ome
relation to each other. At this conjecture,
a &s;udden chillne&s;s ran through her frame;
&s;he looked fearfully upon the durkine&s;s of
her chamber, and the dead &s;ilence, that
prevailed there, heightened to her fancy
its gloomy a&s;pect.</P>
<P>At length, &s;he left the ca&s;ement, but
Her &s;teps faltered, as &s;he approached the
bed, and &s;he &s;topped and looked round.
The &s;ingle lamp, that burned in her &s;pa|cious
<PB N="452" REF="454">
chamebr, was expiring; for a mo|Ment,
&s;he &s;hrunk from the darkne&s;s be|yond;
and then, a&s;hamed of the weakne&s;s,
Which, however, &s;he could not wholly con|quer,
went forward to the bed, where her
mind did not &s;oon know the &s;oothings of
&s;leep. She &s;till mu&s;ed on the late occur|rence,
and looked with anxiety to the next
night, when, at the &s;ame hour, &s;he deter|mined
to watch whether the mu&s;ic re|turned.
&startq;If tho&s;e founds were human,&endq;
aid &s;he, &startq;I &s;hall probably hear them
again.&endq;</P>

<P>ANNETTE came almo&s;t breathle&s;s
To Emily's apartment in the morning. &startq;O
Ma'ame&s;elle!&endq; &s;aid &s;he, in broken &s;entences,
&startq;what news I have to tell! I have found
out who the pri&s;oner is&mdash;but he'was no
pri&s;oner, neither;&mdash;he that was &s;hut up in
the chamber I told you of. I mu&s;t think
him a gho&s;t, for&s;ooth!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Who was the pri&s;oner?&endq; enquired
Emily, while her thoughts glanced back
to the circum&s;tance of the preceeding night.</P>
<P>&startq;You mi&s;take, ma'am,&endq; &s;aid Annette;
&startq;he was not a pri&s;oner, after all.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Who is the per&s;on, then?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Holy Saints!&endq; rejoined Annette;
&startq;How I was &s;urpri&s;ed! Met him ju&s;t
<PB N="454" REF="456">
now, on the rempart below, there. I ne|ver
was &s;o &s;urprised in my life! Ah!
ma'am&s;elle! This is a &s;trange place! I
&s;hould never have done wondering, if I
was to live here an hundred years. But,
as I was &s;aying, I met him ju&s;t now on
the rampart, and I was thinking of nobody le&s;s than of him.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;This trifling is in&s;upportable,&endq; &s;aid
Emily; &startq;prythee, Annette, do nout torture
my patience any longer.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Nay, ma'ame&s;elle, gue&s;s&mdash;gue&s;s who
it was; it was &s;omebody you know very

<P>&startq;I cannot gue&s;s,&endq; &s;aid Emily impa|tiently.</P>
<P>&startq;Nay, ma'ame&s;elle, I'll tell you &s;ome|thing
to gue&s;s by&mdash;A tall Signor, with a
Jongi&s;h face, who walks &s;o &s;tately, and
u&s;ed to wear &s;uch a high feather in his hat;
and u&s;ed often to look down upon the
ground, when people &s;poke to him; and
to look at people from under his eye|brows,
as it were, all &s;o dark and frown|ing.
<PB N="455" REF="457">
You have &s;een him, often and often,
at Vinice, ma'am. Then he was &s;o inti|mate
with the Signor, too. And, now I
think of it, I wonder what he could be
afraid of in this lonely old ca&s;tle, that he
&s;hold &s;hut him&s;elf up for. But he is come
abroad now, for I met him on the rampart
ju&s;t, this minute. I trembled when I &s;aw
him for I always was afraid of him, &s;ome|how;
but I determined I would not let
him &s;ee it' &s;o I went up to him, and made
him a low curte&s;y, 'You are welcome to
the ca&s;tle, Signor Or&s;ino, ' &s;aid I.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;O, it was Signor Or&s;ino, then!.&endq; &s;aid
Emily.</P>
<P>&startq;Yes ma'am&s;elle, Signor Or&s;ino, him|&s;elf,
who cau&s;ed that Venetian gentleman
to be killed, and had been popping about
from place to place, ever &s;ince, as I hear.&endq;
&startq;Good God!&endq; exclaimed Emily, re|covering
from the &s;hock of this intelli|gnce;
&startq;and is be come to Udolpho!
He does well to endeavour to conceal
him&s;elf.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="456" REF="458">
&startq;Yes ma'am&s;elle, but if that was all,
this di&s;olate palce would conceal him,
without his &s;hutting him&s;elf up in one
room. Who would think of coming to
look for him here? I am &s;ure I &s;hould as
&s;oon think of going to look for any body
in the other world.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;There is &s;ome truth in that,&endq; &s;aid
Emily, who would now have concluded it
Was Or&s;ino's mu&s;ic, which &s;he had heard,
on the preceding night, had &s;he not
Known, that he had neither ta&s;te, or &s;kill
in the art. But, though &s;he was unwilling
to add to the bumber of Annette's &s;ur|pri&s;es,
by mentioning the &s;ubject of her
own &s;he enquired, whether any per&s;on in
the ca&s;tle played on a mu&s;ical in&s;trument?</P>
<P>&startq;O yes, ma'am&s;elle! there is Benedetto
plays the great drum to admiration; and
then, there is Launcelor the trumpeter;
nay, for that mater, Lundovico him&s;elf
can play on the trumpet;&mdash;but he is ill
now. I remember once&endq;&mdash;</P>
<P>Emily interrupted her; &startq;Have you
<PB N="457" REF="459">
heard no other mu&s;ic &s;ince you came to
the ca&s;tle&mdash;none la&s;t night?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Why, did you hear any la&s;t night,
ma'am&s;elle?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Emily evaded this que&s;tion, by repeat|ing
her own.</P>
<P>&startq;Why, no ma'am,&endq; replied Annette;
&startq;I never heard any mu&s;ic here, I mu&s;t
&s;ay, but the drums and the trumpert; and,
as for la&s;t night, I did nothing but dream
I &s;aw my late lady's gho&s;t.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Your late lady's,&endq; &s;aid Emily in a
tremulous voice; &startq;you have heard more,
then. Tell me&mdash;tell me all, Annette, I
entreat; tell me the wor&s;t at once.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Nay, ma'am&s;elle, you know the wor&s;t
already.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I know nothing,&endq; &s;aid Emily.</P>
<P>&startq;Yes, you do, ma'am&s;elle; you know,
that nobody knows any thing about her;
and it is plain, therefore, &s;he is gone, the
way of the fir&s;t lady of the ca&s;tle&mdash;nobody
ever knew any thing about her.&endq;</P>
<P>Emily leaned her head upon her hand,
<PB N="458" REF="460">
and was, for &s;ome time, &s;ilent; then, tell|ing
Annette &s;he wi&s;hed to be along, the
latter left the room.</P>
<P>The remark of Annette had revived
Emily's terrible &s;u&s;picion, concerning the
fate of Madame Montoni; and &s;he re|&s;olved
to make another effort to obtain
certainty on this &s;ubject, by applying to
Montoni once more.</P>
<P>When Annette returned, a few hours
After, &s;he told Emily, that the porter of
the ca&s;tle wi&s;hed very much to &s;peak with
her, for that he had &s;omething of import|ance
to &s;ay; her &s;pirits had, however, of
late been &s;o &s;ubject ot alarm, that any new
circum&s;tance excited it; and this ma&s;&s;age
from the porter, when her fir&s;t &s;urpri&s;e
was over, made her look round for &s;ome
lurking danger, the more &s;u&s;piciou&s;ly, per|haps,
becau&s;e &s;he had frequently remarked
the unplea&s;ant air and countenance of this
man. She now he&s;itated, whether to &s;peak
with him, doubting even, that this reque&s;t
was only a pretext to draw her into &s;ome
<PB N="459" REF="461">
danger; but a llittle reflection &s;hewed her
the improbabilty of this, and &s;he blu&s;hed
at her weak fears.</P>
<P>&startq;I will &s;peak to him, Annette,&endq; &s;aid
&s;he; &startq;de&s;ire him to come to the corridor immediately.&endq;</P>
<P>Annette deprted, and &s;oon after re|turned.</P>
<P>&startq;Barnardine, ma'am&s;elle,&endq; &s;aid &s;he,
&startq;dare not come to the corridor, left he
&s;hould be di&s;covered, it is &s;o far from his
po&s;t; and he dare not even leave the gates
for a moment now; but, if you will come
to him at the portl, through &s;ome round|about
pa&s;&s;ages he told me of, without
cro&s;&s;ing the courts, he has that to tell,
which will &s;urpri&s;e you. But you mu&s;t
not come through the courts, left the Sig|nor
&s;hould &s;ee you.&endq;</P>
<P>Emily, neither approving the&s;e &startq;round|about
pa&s;&s;ages,&endq; nor the other part of the
reque&s;t, now po&s;itively refu&s;ed to go.
&startq;Tell him,&endq; &s;aid &s;he, &startq;if he had any
thing of con&s;equence to impart, I will
<PB N="460" REF="462">
hear him in the corridor, whenever he has
an opportunity of coming thither.&startq;</P>
<P>Annette went to deliver this me&s;&s;age,
and was ab&s;ent a con&s;iderable time. When
&s;he returned,&endq; It won't do, ma'am&s;elle,'
&s;aid &s;he. &startq;Barnardine has been con&s;ider|ing
all this time what can be done, for it
is as much as his place is worth to leave
his po&s;t now. But, if you will come to
the ea&s;t rampart in the du&s;k of the even|ing,
he can, perhaps, &s;teal away, and tell
you all he has to &s;ay.&endq;</P>
<P>Emily was &s;urpri&s;ed and alarmed, at the
&s;ecrency which this man &s;eemed to think &s;o
nece&s;&s;ary, and he&s;itated whether to meet
him, till, con&s;idering, that he might mean
to warn her of &s;ome &s;erious danger, &s;he re|&s;olved
to go.</P>
<P>&startq;Soon after &s;un-&s;et,&endq; &s;aid &s;he, &startq;I will
be at the end of the ea&s;t rampart. But
then the watch will be &s;et,&endq; &s;he added,
recollecting her&s;elf, &startq;and how can Bar|nadine
pa&s;s unob&s;erved?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;That is ju&s;t what I &s;aid to him,
<PB N="461" REF="463">
ma'am, and he an&s;wered me, that he had
the key of the gate, at the end of the ram|part,
that leads towards the courts, and
could let him&s;elf through that way; and
as for the &s;entinels, there were none at this
end of the terrace, becau&s;e the place is
guraded enough by the high walls of the
ca&s;tle, and the ea&s;t turret; and he &s;aid
tho&s;se at the other end were too far off to
&s;ee him, if it was pretty du&s;kyi&s;h.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Well,&endq; &s;aid Emily, &startq;I mu&s;t hear
what he has to tell; and, therefore, de&s;ire
you will go with me to the terrace, this evening.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;He de&s;ired is might be pretty du&s;kyi&s;h,
ma'am&s;elle,&endq; repeated Annette, &startq;becau&s;e
of the watch."</P>
<P>Emily pau&s;ed, and then &s;aid &s;he would
Be on the terrace, an hour after &s;un-set;&mdash;
&startq;and tell Barnardin,&endq; &s;he added,&endq; to be
punctual to the time; for that I, al&s;o, may
be ob&s;erved by Signor Montoni. Where
is the Signor? I would &s;peak with him.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;He is in the cedar chamber,ma'am,
<PB N="462" REF="464">
councelling with the other Signors. He is
going to give them a &s;ort of a treat to-day,
to make up for what pa&s;&s;ed at the la&s;t, I
&s;uppo&s;e; the people are all very bu&s;y in the kitchen.&endq;</P>
<P>Emily now enquired, if Montoi ex|pected
any new gue&s;ts? and Annette be|lived
that he did not. &startq;Poor Ludo|vico!&endq;
added &s;he, &startq;would be as merry
as the be&s;t of them, if he was well; but
he may recover yet. Count Morano was
wounded as bad, as he, and he is got well
again, and is gone back to Venice.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Is he &s;o?&endq; &s;aid Emily, &startq;when did
you hear this?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I heard is, la&s;t night, ma'ame&s;elle, but I forgot to tell it.&endq;</P>
<P>Emily a&s;ked &s;ome further ue&s;tions, and
then, de&s;iring Annette would ob&s;erve and
Inform her, when Montoni was alone, the
girl went to deliver her me&s;&s;age to Barnardine.</P>
<P>Montoni was, however, &s;o much en|gaged,
during the whole day, that Emily
<PB N="463" REF="465">
had no opportunity of &s;eeking a relea&s;e
form her terrible &s;u&s;pen&s;e, concerning her
aunt. Annette was employed in watching
his &s;teps, and in attending upon Ludovico, whom &s;he, a&s;&s;it&s;ted by Caterina, nur&s;ed
with the utmo&s;t care; and Emily was, of
cour&s;e, left much alone. Her thoughts
dwelt often on the me&s;&s;age of the porter,
and were employed in conjecturing the
&s;ubject, that occa&s;ioned it, which &s;he &s;ome|times
imagined concerned the fate of Ma|dame
Montoni; at others, that it related
to &s;ome per&s;onal dange, which threatened
her&s;elf. The cautious &s;ecrecy which Bar|nardine
ob&s;erved in his conduct, inclined
her to believe the latter.</P>
<P>As the hour of appointment drew near,
Her impatience increa&s;ed. At length, the
Fun &s;et; &s;he heard the pa&s;&s;ing &s;teps of the
&s;entinels going to their po&s;ts; and waited
only for Annette to accompany her to th
terrace, who, &s;oon after, came, and they
de&s;cended together. When Emily ex|pre&s;&s;ed
apprehen&s;ions of meeting Montoni,
<PB N="464" REF="466">
or &s;ome of his gue&s;ts, &startq;O, there is no
fear of that, ma'am&s;elle,&endq; &s;aid Annette,
&startq;they are all &s;et in to &s;ea&s;ting yet, and
that Barnardne knows.&endq;</P>
<P>They reached the fir&s;t terrace, where the
&s;entinels demanded who pa&s;&s;ed; and
Emily, having an&s;wered, walked on to the
ea&s;t rampat, at the entrance of which
they were again &s;topped; and, having
again replied, were permitted to proceed.
But Emilydid not like to expo&s;e her&s;elf
to the di&s;cretion of the&s;e men, at &s;uch an
hour; and impatient ot withdraw from
the &s;ituatin, &s;he &s;tepped ha&s;tily on in
&s;earch of Barnardine. He was not yet come.
She leaned pen&s;ively on the wall of the
rampart, and waited for him. The gloom
of twilight &s;at deep on the &s;urrounding ob|Jects,
blending in &s;oft confu&s;ion the valley,
the mountains, and the woods, who&s;e tall
heads, &s;tirred by the evening breeze, gave
cept a faint, faint chorus of di&s;tant voices,
that aro&s;e from within the ca&s;tle.</P>
<P><PB N="465" REF="467">
&startq;What voices are tho&s;e?&endq; &s;aid Emily,
as &s;he fearfully li&s;tened.</P>
<P>&startq;It is only the Signor and his gue&s;ts,
carou&s;ing,&endq; replied Annette.</P>
<P>&startq;Good God!&endq; tought Emily, &startq;can
this man's heart be &s;o gay, when he has
made another being &s;o wretched; if, in|deed,
my aunt is yet &s;uffered to feel her
wretchedne&s;s? O! whatever are my own
&s;ufferings, may my heart never, never be
hardened again&s;t tho&s;e of other!"</P>
<P>She looked up with a &s;en&s;ation of horror,
to the ea&s;t turret, near which &s;he then
&s;tood; a light glimmered through the
grates of the lower chameber, but tho&s;e of the up|per
one were dark. Pre&s;ently, &s;he percieved
a per&s;on moving with a lampacro&s;s the lower
room; but this circum&s;tance revived no
hope, concerning Madame Montoni, whom
&s;he had vainly &s;ought in that apartment,
which had appeared to contain only &s;ol|diers'
accoutrements. Emily, however, de|termined
to attempt the outer door of the
turreet, as &s;oon as Barnardine &s;hould with|draw;
<PB N="466" REF="468">
and, if it was unfa&s;tened, to make
another effort to di&s;cover her aunt.</P>
<P>The moments pa&s;&s;ed, but &s;till Barnar|dine
did not appear; and Emily, becom|ing
unea&s;y, he&s;itated whether to wait any
longer. She would have &s;ent Annette to
the portal to ha&s;ten him, but feared to be
left alone, for it was now almo&s;t dark, and
a melancholy &s;treak of red, that &s;till lin|gered
in the we&s;t, was the only ve&s;tige of
departed day. The &s;trong intere&s;t, how|ever,
which Barnardine's me&s;&s;age had
awakened, overcame other apprehen&s;ions,
and &s;till detained her.</P>
<P>While &s;he was cnjecturing with Annette
What could thus occa&s;ion his ab&s;ence, they'
heard a key turn in the lock of the gate
near them, and pre&s;ently &s;aw man ad|vancing.
It was Barnardine, of whom
Emily ha&s;tily enquired what he had to
communicate, and de&s;ired, that he would
tell her quickly, &startq;for I am chilled with
this evening air,&endq; &s;aid &s;he.</P>
<P>&startq;You mu&s;t di&s;mi&s; you maid, lady,&endq;
<PB N="467" REF="469">
&s;aid the man in a voice, the deep tone of
which &s;hocked her, &startq;what I have to tell
is to you only.&endq;</P>
<P>Emily, after &s;ome he&s;itation, de&s;red
Annette to withdraw to a little di&s;tance.
&startq;Now, my friend, what would you &s;ay?&endq;
He was &s;ilent a moment, as if con&s;ider|ing,
and then &s;aid&mdash;</P>
<P>&startq;That which would co&s;t me my place,
at lea&s;t, if it came to the Signor's ears.
You mu&s;t promi&s;e, lady, that nothing
&s;hall ever make you tell a &s;yllable of the
matter; I have been tru&s;ted in this affair,
and, if it was known, that I betrayed
my tru&s;t, my life, perhaps, might an|&s;wer
it. But I was concerned for you,
lady, and I re&s;olved to tell you.&endq; He
pau&s;ed&mdash;</P>
<P>Emily thanked him, a&s;&s;ured him that
he might repo&s;e on her di&s;cretion, and en|treated
him to di&s;patch.</P>
<P>&startq;Annette told us in the hall how
unhappy you was about Signora Mon|toni,
<PB N="468" REF="470">
and how much you wi&s;hed to know
what was become of her.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Mo&s;t true,&endq; &s;aid Emily eagerly,&endq; and
you can inform me. I conjure you tell me
the wor&s;t, without he&s;itation.&endq; She re&s;ted
her trembling arm upon the wall.</P>
<P>&startq;I can tell you,&endq; &s;aid Barnardine, and
pau&s;ed.&mdash;</P>
<P>Emily had no power to enforce her en|treaties.</P>
<P>&startq;I <HI>can</HI> tell you,&endq; re&s;umed Barnardine,
&mdash;&startq;but&mdash;</P>
<P>&startq;But what?&endq; exclaimed Emily, reco|vering
her re&s;olution.</P>
<P>&startq;Here I am, ma'am&s;elle,&endq; &s;aid Annette,
who, having heard the eager tone, in which
Emily pronounced the&s;e words, came run|ning
towards her.</P>
<P>&startq;Retire!&endq; &s;aid Barnardine, &s;ternly;
&startq;you are not wanted;&endq; and, as Emily
&s;aid nothing, Annette obeyed.</P>
<P>&startq;I <HI>can</HI> tell you,&endq; repeated the porter,
&mdash;&startq;but I know not how&mdash;you was af|flicted
before.&endq;&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="469" REF="471">
&startq;I am prepared for the wor&s;t, my
friend,&endq; &s;aid Emily, in a firm and &s;olemn
voice. &startq;I can &s;upport any certainty bet|ter
than this &s;u&s;pen&s;e.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Well, Signora, if that is the ca&s;e
you &s;hall hear.&mdash;You know, I &s;uppo&s;e,
that the Signor and his lady u&s;ed &s;ome|times
to di&s;agree. It is none of my con|cernes
to enquire what it was about, but I
believe you know it was &s;o.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Well,&endq; &s;aid Emily, &startq;proceed.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;The Signor, it &s;eems, had lately been
very wrath again&s;t her. I &s;aw all, and
heard all,&mdash;a great deal more than people
thoght for; but it was none of my bu&s;I|ne&s;s,
&s;o I &s;aid nothing. A few days ago,
the Signor &s;ent for me. 'barnardine,' &s;ays
he, 'you are&mdash;an hone&s;t man, I think I
can tru&s;t you.' I a&s;&s;ured his Excellenza
that he could. 'Then,' &s;ays he, as near
as I can remmber, 'I have an affair in
hand, which I want you to a&s;&s;i&s;t me in.'&mdash;
Then he told me what I was to do; but
<PB N="470" REF="472">
that I &s;hall &s;ay nothing about&mdash;it con|cerned
only the Signora.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;O Heavens!&endq; exclaimed Emily&mdash;
&startq;what have you done?&endq;</P>
<P>Barnardine he&s;itated, and was &s;ilent.
&startq;What fiend could tempt him, or you,
to &s;uch an act!&endq; cried Emily, chilled with horror, and &s;carcely able to &s;upport her
fainting &s;pirits.</P>
<P>&startq;It was a fiend,&endq; &s;aid Barnardine in a
gloomy tone of voice. They were now both
&s;ilent;&mdash;Emily had not courage to enquire
further, and Barnardine &s;eemed to &s;hrink
from telling more. At length he &s;aid,
&startq;It is of no u&s;e to think of the pa&s;t; the
Signor was cruel enough, but he would
be obeyed. What &s;ignified my refu&s;ing?
He would have found others, who had no
&s;cruples.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;You have murdered her, then!&endq; &s;aid
Emily, in a hollow and inward voice&mdash;
&startq;I am talking with a murderer!&endq; barnar|dine
&s;tood &s;ilent; while Emily turned from
him, and attempted to leave the place.</P>
<P><PB N="471" REF="473">
&startq;Stay, lady!&endq; &s;aid he&endq; You de&s;erve
to think &s;o &s;till&mdash;&s;ince you can believe me
capable of &s;uch a deed.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;If you are innocent, tell me quickly,&endq;
&s;aid Emily, in &s;aint accents, &startq;for I feel
I &s;hall not be able to hear you long&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I will tell you no more,&endq; &s;aid he, and
walked away. Emily had ju&s;t &s;trength
enough to bid him &s;tay, and then to call
Annette, on who&s;e arm &s;he leaned, and
they walked &s;lowly up the rampart, till
they heard &s;teps behind them. It was
Barnardine again.</P>
<P>&startq;Send away the girl,&endq; &s;aid he, &startq;and
I will tell you more.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;She mu&s;t not go,&endq; &s;aid Emily; &startq;what
you have to &s;ay, &s;he may hear.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;May &s;he &s;o, lady? &s;aid he.&endq; You
&s;hall know no more, then,' and he was
going, though &s;lowly, when Emily's anxi|ety,
overcoming the re&s;entment and fear,
which the man's behaviour had rou&s;ed,
&s;he de&s;ired him to &s;tay, and bade Annette
retire.</P>
<P><PB N="472" REF="474">
&startq;The Signora is alive,&endq; &s;aid he, &startq;for
me. She is my pri&s;oner, though; his Ex|cellenza
has &s;hut her up in the chamber
over the great gates of the court, and I
have the charge of her. I was going to
have told you, you might &s;ee her&mdash;but
now&mdash;&endq;</P>
<P>Emily, relieved from an unutterable
load of angui&s;h by this &s;peech, had now
only to a&s;k Barnardine's forgivene&s;s, and
to conjure, that he would let her vi&s;it her
aunt.</P>
<P>He comlied with le&s;s reluctance, than
&s;he expected, and told her, that, if &s;he
would repair, on the following night, when
the Signor was retired to re&s;t, to the po&s;|tern-gate
of the ca&s;tle, &s;he &s;hould, perhaps,
&s;ee Madame Montoni.</P>
<P>Amid all the thankfulne&s;s, which Emily
Felt, for this conce&s;&s;ion, &s;he thought &s;he
Ob&s;erved a malicious triumph in his man|Ner,
when he pronounced the la&s;t words;
but, in the next moment, &s;he di&s;mi&s;&s;ed
the thought, and, having again thanked
<PB N="473" REF="475">
him, commended her aunt to his pity, and
a&s;&s;ured him, tha &s;he would her&s;elf reward
him, and would be punctual to her ap|pointment;
&s;he bade him good night, and
retired, unob&s;erved, to her chamber. It
was a con&s;iderable time, before the tumult
of joy, which Barnardine's unexpected in|tellignece
had occa&s;ioned, allowed Emily
to think with clearne&s;s, or to be on&s;cious
of the real dangers, that &s;till s;urrounded
Madame Montoni and her&s;elf. When
this agitation &s;ub&s;ided, &s;he perceived, that
her aunt was yet the pri&s;oner of a man, to
who&s;e vengeance, or avarice, &s;he might
fall a &s;acrifice; and, when &s;he further con|&s;idered
the &s;avage a&s;pect of the per&s;on,
who was appointed to guard Madame
Montoni, her doom appeared to be al|ready
&s;ealed, for the countenance of Bar|nardine
&s;eemed to bear the &s;tamp of a mur|derer;
and, when &s;he had looked upon it,
&s;he felt inclined to believe, that there was
no deed, however black, which he might
not be prevailed upon to execute. The&s;e
<PB N="474" REF="476">
reflections brought to her remembrance the
tone of voice, in which he had promi&s;ed
to grant her reque&s;t to &s;ee his pri&s;oner;
and &s;he mu&s;ed upon it long in unea&s;ine&s;s
and doubt. Sometimes, &s;he even he&s;itated,
whether to tru&s;t her&s;elf with him at the
lonely hour he had appointed; and once,
and only once, it &s;truck her, that Madame
Montoni, might be already murdered, and
that this re&s;&s;ian was appointed to decoy
her&s;elf to &s;ome &s;ecret place, where her life
al&s;o was to be &s;acrificed to the avarice of
Montoni, who then would claim &s;ecurely
the conte&s;ted e&s;tates in Languedoc. The
con&s;idertaion of the enormity of &s;uch guilt
did, at length, relieve her from the belief
of its probability, but not from all the
doubts and fears, which a recollection of
Barnardine's manner had occa&s;ioned. From
the&s;e &s;ubjects, her thoughts, at length,
pa&s;&s;ed to other; and,as the evening ad|vanced,
&s;he remembered, with &s;omewhat
more than &s;urpri&s;e, the mu&s;ic &s;he had
heared, on the preceding night, and now
<PB N="475" REF="477">
awaited its return, with more than curio|&s;ity.</P>
<P>She di&s;tingui&s;hed till a late hour, the
di&s;tant carou&s;als of Montoni and his com|panions
&mdash;the loud conte&s;t, the di&s;&s;olute
laugh and the choral &s;ong, that made the
halls re-echo. At length, &s;he heard the
heavy gates of the ca&s;tle &s;hut for the night
and tho&s;e &s;ounds in&s;tantly &s;unk into a
&s;ilence, which was di&s;turbed only by the
whi&s;pering &s;teps of per&s;ons, pa&s;&s;ing through
the galleries to their remote rooms. Emily
now judging it to be about the time, when
&s;he had heard the mu&s;ic, on the preceding
night, di&s;mi&s;&s;ed Annette, and gently open|ed
the ca&s;ement to watch for its return.
The planet &s;he had &s;o particularly noticed,
at the recurrence of the mu&s;ic, was not yet
ri&s;en; but, with &s;uper&s;titious weakne&s;s,
&s;he kept her eyes fixed on that part of the
hemi&s;phere, where it would ri&s;e, almo&s;t
expecting, that, when it appeared, the
&s;ounds would return. At length, it came,
&s;erenely bright, over the ea&s;tern towers of
<PB N="476" REF="478">
the ca&s;tle. Her heart trembled, when &s;he
perceived it, and &s;he had &s;carcely courage
to remain at the ca&s;ement, le&s;t the return|ing
mu&s;ic &s;hould confirm her terror, and
&s;ubdue the little &s;trength, &s;he yer retained.
The clock &s;oon after &s;truck one, and.,
knowing this to be about the time, when
the &s;ounds had occurred, &s;he &s;at down in
a chair, near the ca&s;ement,and endeavour|ed
to compo&s;e her &s;pirits; but the anxiety
of expectation yet di&s;turbed them. Every
thing, however, remained &s;till; &s;he heard
only the &s;olitary &s;tep of a &s;entinel, and the
lulling murmur of the woods below, and
&s;he again leaned from the ca&s;ement, and
again looked, as if for intelligence, to the
planet, which was now ri&s;en high above
the towers.</P>
<P>Emily continued to li&s;ten, but no mu&s;ic
came. &startq;Tho&s;e were &s;urely no mortal
&s;ounds!&endq; &s;aid &s;he recollecting their en|trancing
melody. &startq;No inhabitant of this
ca&s;tle could utter &s;uch; and, where is the
feeling, that could modulate &s;uch exqui&s;ite
<PB N="477" REF="479">
expre&s;&s;ion? We all know, that it has been
a&s;&s;irmed cele&s;tial &s;ounds have &s;ometimes
been heard on earth. Father Pierre and
father Antoine declared, that they had
&s;ometimes heard them in the &s;tillne&s;s of
night, when they along were waking to
offer their ori&s;ons to heaven. Nay, my
dear father him&s;elf, once &s;aid, that, &s;oon
after my mother's death,as he lay watch|ful
in grief, &s;ounds of uncommon &s;weet|ne&s;s
called him from his bed; and, on
opening his window, he heard lofty mu&s;ic
pa&s;s along the midnight air. It &s;oothed
him, he &s;aid; he looked up with confi|dence
to heaven, and re&s;igned her to his
God.&endq;</P>
<P>Emily pau&s;ed to weep at this recollec|tion.
&startq;Perhaps,&endq; re&s;umed &s;he, &startq;pehaps,
tho&s;e &s;trains I heard were &s;ent to comfort,
&mdash;to encourage me! Never &s;hall I forget
tho&s;e I heard, at this hour, in Langue|doc!
Perhaps, my father watched over
me, at this moment!&endq; She wept again in
<PB N="478" REF="480">
tenderne&s;s. Thus pa&s;&s;ed the hour in watch|fulne&s;s
and &s;olemn thought; but no &s;ounds
returned; and, after remaining at the ca&s;e|ment,
till the light tint of dawn began to
edge the mountain-tops and &s;teal upon
the night-&s;hade, &s;he concluded, that they
would not return, and retired reluctantly
to repo&s;e.</P>
