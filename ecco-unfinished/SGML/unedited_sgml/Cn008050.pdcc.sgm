<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THIS Hi&s;tory was original|ly intended to have been publi&s;hed la&s;t Summer, but on my &s;aying I de&s;igned in my Preface to give a &s;hort account of my Life; &s;everal Gentlemen and Ladies in&s;i&s;ted on my &s;welling my Narrative to a Volume, which in Compliance to their Reque&s;t I did; which was the Con&s;equence of retard|ing

the Publication of this. I have endeavoured to do Ju&s;tice to every Character according to their different Merits. And I dare &s;ay, there is not a young Lady in <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> that would not wi&s;h to be the wor|thy Imi$ator of Mi&s;s <HI>Evelyn</HI> in each Action of her Life. Nor is her Father le&s;s worthy, be|ing a general Example for the Male Part of the Creation; whatever Faults may be criti|cally ob&s;erved in the Diction, I hope will be in Part attoned for, by endeavouring to keep up the noble Sentiments of Virtue &s;o entirely con&s;i&s;tent with the true Character of an hone&s;t Soul, whether dignified with Title, or

<P>I &s;hall trouble my Reader no further, than to wi&s;h my Endeavour to entertain them may &s;ucceed, and by the Sale of my Book &s;hall be able to judge, whether I &s;hall ever dare to make any farther Attempt of this Nature.</P>

<HEAD>THE HISTORY OF Mr. <HI>Dumont</HI>, AND Mi&s;s <HI>Charlotte Evelyn</HI>.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. I. Some Account of Mr. <HI>Dumont's</HI> Family.</HEAD>
<P>MR. Henry Dumont, the &s;ub|ject of the following &s;heets, was a native of France, and only &s;on of Mr. Archi|bald Dumont, (a gentleman of immen&s;e fortune and good extraction) by his mo|ther's &s;ide de&s;cended from a noble family, &s;he being the daughter and &s;ole heire&s;s of the Count De&s;trades, who became a
<PB N="2" REF="12">
widower when this young lady was but four years of age: The extreme regard he had for the memory of her much la|mented mother, con&s;iderably added to his care of this tender pledge of their af|fections. Who in her infancy gave lively hopes of becoming what &s;he pro|ved, the wonder of the age, and a glo|rious example to po&s;terity.</P>
<P>She was early in&s;tructed in the &s;everal branches of polite literature, which with the nece&s;&s;ary accompli&s;hments of mu&s;ic, &s;inging, dancing, &amp;c. &s;he was ju&s;tly accounted the paragon of art and nature's workman&s;hip.</P>
<P>At the age of eighteen, her papa carried her to court, being the fir&s;t time of her appearance there; the reader may ea&s;ily conceive the magnificence of her dre&s;s on this occa&s;ion, but her &s;parkling jewels were totally eclip&s;ed by the bril|liancy of her angelic form, which natu|rally attracted the eyes of the whole circle.</P>
<P>When &s;he was pre&s;ented to the King, on offering to kneel to ki&s;s his hand, he &s;carce permitted her to bend her knee; a&s;&s;uring her he thought &s;o noble and a|miable
<PB N="3" REF="13">
a form, rather &s;eemed born to fill a throne than kneel to it: in &s;hort, his maje&s;ty was &s;o captivated with the tran|&s;cendency of her beauty, that he fell in|to a deep and &s;udden melancholly, which con&s;iderably increa&s;ed each time this fair one vi&s;ited the court.</P>
<P>This &s;urprizing change in the monarch univer&s;ally a&s;toni&s;hed every one who had the honour of paying their per&s;onal re|&s;pects, as he was naturally of a gay and cheerful di&s;po&s;ition; no one could con|ceive what could be the motive of &s;o melancholly an alteration; but the true cau&s;e was known to a particular favourite, who was privy to all his maje&s;ty's &s;ecrets in love affairs; and having liberty to &s;ay on tho&s;e occa&s;ions what he thought pro|per, advi&s;ed him to cure his malady, by loading the Count with &s;uch prefer|ments, that he &s;hould think him&s;elf o|bliged to yield him up his daughter in return.</P>
<P>Ala&s;s! &s;aid the King, his fortune is &s;o great, he never thought it worth his while to accept of any places, tho' con|&s;iderable ones have been offered him in my father's reign; therefore I have
<PB N="4" REF="14">
very little rea&s;on to hope for &s;ucce&s;s from a &s;cheme of that nature.</P>
<P>Why then, replied the evil councellor, you mu&s;t have recour&s;e to other &s;trata|gems; and not let a nation &s;uffer in the lo&s;s of a glorious monarch for a puny girl. And with your maje&s;ty's per|mi&s;&s;ion, I will u&s;e my be&s;t endeavours to procure this beauty for you.</P>
<P>The King overcome by love and im|patient de&s;ire, gave in to all his confi|dant propo&s;ed; who was di&s;patched to the Count with a me&s;&s;age to attend him in private.</P>
<P>His lord&s;hip directly obeyed the &s;um|mons, and after &s;ome di&s;cour&s;e upon in|different matters had pa&s;&s;ed between them; my lord, &s;aid the King, I mu&s;t thank you for the favour you did the court, in bringing to it one of the mo&s;t &s;hining ornaments it e'er was graced with. And to convince you how much I e&s;teem the lady, I beg you will permit me to make her an offer, of one of the highe&s;t po&s;ts of honour, that &s;he may be more frequent in her vi&s;its here; and that your lord&s;hip would make choice of any place on your part, that I might be com|pleatly
<PB N="5" REF="15">
happy, in having con&s;tantly near me two of the mo&s;t valuable per&s;ons in my kingdom.</P>
<P>The Count bowed, and thanking his maje&s;ty for the honour he did him, hoped he would not think he wanted a proper &s;en&s;e of his goodne&s;s, in excu&s;ing him|&s;elf from accepting his offer; adding, that he &s;hould ever find him a loyal &s;ubject, and a firm adherent to his intere&s;t; but he re&s;olved never to be a motive of envy by entering into any employment at court; and that his &s;word &s;hould be ready in his defence or his country's good, if occa&s;ion &s;hould require it; and that without any other reward, than the mere de&s;ire of manife&s;ting his duty and fidelity.</P>
<P>The King finding him po&s;itively bent again&s;t this propo&s;al, no longer detained him. The Count took leave, and ha&s;tened home, immediately ordering his travelling equipage to be got rea|dy to e&s;cort him and Lady Charlotte to his country &s;eat.</P>
<P>The family were under great con&s;ter|nation at this &s;udden and ha&s;ty removal, but the Count's quick apprehen&s;ion of
<PB N="6" REF="16">
the King's de&s;ign upon his daughter, would not permit him to &s;tay long enough to give any other rea&s;on for it than his will to have it &s;o.</P>
<P>Lady Charlotte, who was no le&s;s &s;ur|prized than the re&s;t, would not offer to enquire into the matter; judging her papa's commands a &s;ufficient motive for her obedience.</P>
<P>Orders were left to report to his ma|je&s;ty, that the Count was taken dange|rou&s;ly ill; to prevent any jealou&s;y that might ari&s;e from his non-appearance at the drawing-room; and to conceal his ab&s;ence for a few days, till he had ef|fected a de&s;ign, which would prevent a|ny future attacks upon the lady's virtue. And if any letters were &s;ent, they &s;hould be carefully conveyed to his lord&s;hip.</P>
<P>This charge was left with one Mr. Evelyn, an Engli&s;h gentleman, who had formerly been po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a very good e&s;tate, but repeated misfortunes had reduced him to &s;o low an ebb, he was obliged to take refuge in a foreign country, for the &s;ecurity of his per&s;on; and with a &s;mall remainder of his wreck'd fortune, he and his lady em|barked
<PB N="7" REF="17" MS="Y">
for France, where his great &s;en&s;e and learning &s;oon recommended him to the acquaintance of people of the highe&s;t di&s;tinction; who were conti|nually &s;olliciting him for his company. Among the re&s;t the noble Count De&s;trades was particularly charmed with his under|&s;tanding, and his wife's, who was e|qually coveted by the ladies.</P>
<P>The Count's approbation grew into a friend&s;hip for this unfortunate couple; in&s;omuch, that he took them entirely under his protection. And as Mr. Evelyn was remarkable for his &s;cholar|&s;hip, made him tutor, and his &s;pou&s;e governe&s;s to lady Charlotte, by which means, &s;he &s;oon became mi&s;tre&s;s of the Engli&s;h tongue; and tran&s;lated &s;everal Latin, French, and Italian authors. She was about five years of Age when Mr. Evelyn fir&s;t &s;aw her, from which time, the Count left her entirely to his, and Mrs. Evelyn's care; which charge they acquitted with great honour to them|&s;elves, and univer&s;al admiration of all who had the plea&s;ure of &s;eeing an in|&s;tance of their power, in making lady Charlotte one of the mo&s;t accompli&s;h'd
<PB N="8" REF="18">
of her &s;ex. Her governe&s;s who &s;ung, and play'd the harp&s;ichord finely, in|&s;tructed her in tho&s;e two excellent qua|lifications, in which &s;he was not inferior to the mo&s;t &s;kilfull ma&s;ters.</P>
<P>The Count and his lovely daughter's &s;weetne&s;s of di&s;po&s;ition, rendered Mr. Evelyn's life (tho' in a &s;tate of de|pendance) a continued &s;cene of ea&s;e and chearfulne&s;s; and he often declared him|&s;elf happier in this retreat, than when in the highe&s;t affluence of his fortune.</P>
<P>But to return to the Count and Lady Charlotte, whom we have left on the road; the kind father thinking his daugh|ter might be unea&s;y, from being igno|rant of the cau&s;e of this unexpected jour|ney, thought it proper to unfold the my&s;tery, and thus addre&s;&s;ed her.</P>
<P>I fear, my deare&s;t child, you are ap|prehen&s;ive of &s;ome mi&s;take at court, that may have cau&s;ed this extraordinary expedition; but to ea&s;e your mind in that re&s;pect, I mu&s;t inform you, it pro|ceeds from my tender regard for your per&s;on and honour; both which the King has formed a cruel de&s;ign again&s;t; 'tis needle&s;s to tell you what pa&s;&s;ed be|tween
<PB N="9" REF="19" MS="Y">
us; let it &s;uffice I have protected you from his utmo&s;t efforts to undo you. And &s;hould his re&s;entment and di&s;ap|pointment urge him to level at my head, I had rather lo&s;e that, than bear the more deadly $troke of &s;eeing thee become a &s;a|crifice to lawle&s;s love.</P>
<P>The &s;en&s;ible young lady was &s;o tender|ly affected with her fond parent's regard, that &s;he demon&s;trated her gratitude, by a &s;udden &s;hower of tears; and gra&s;ping his hand, ki&s;&s;ed it o'er and o'er, till &s;he found words to thank him; a&s;&s;uring him, at the &s;ame time, that &s;he was &s;o far from being vain of her conque&s;t, that it on|ly excited her contempt; as &s;he conceiv|ed, that a virtuous mind was preferable to all the glittering grandeur of a throne.</P>
<P>The Count who was not a little pleas'd at this virtuous acknowledgement from his daughter, proceeded to an enquiry into her heart. You are now, my Child, &s;aid he, &s;ecured from a probability of any danger from the King, and to make that happine&s;s more perfect, I de&s;ire you will candidly tell me if among the number of admirers, who have addre&s;s'd them&s;elves to you, there is any one in particular that
<PB N="10" REF="20">
has made an impre&s;&s;ion on your mind? a ri&s;ing blu&s;h diffus'd it &s;elf on her lovely face attended with a vi&s;ible confu&s;ion, and artle&s;s innocence.</P>
<P>The Count who was ever cautious of giving her a moment's di&s;quiet, beg'd her not to be unea&s;y at the que&s;tion, for he &s;tarted it to make her happy, not to give her the lea&s;t di&s;quiet; therefore my dear let me propo&s;e to you at once a valuable partner, one who I am certain loves you with a boundle&s;s pa&s;&s;ion, and who has long importun'd me as well as your &s;elf to make him happy; but as I believe both you and I have acted from one principle, I mean the fear of giving each other pain, we have protracted a joy which might po&s;&s;ibly have been diffu&s;ive thro' the family. Mr. Archibald Dumont is the per&s;on I'm going to offer to you, but if your choice prefers any other, I &s;hall wave the authority of the parent, and yield to your own inclination and di&s;cretion, as I am confident your good &s;en&s;e would not blindly &s;uffer you to fix on any one who&s;e merit did not &s;ufficiently recommend him.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="21">On the mentioning Mr. Dumont, a &s;e|cond blu&s;h &s;ucceeded the former; which the count perceiving, to prevent any further check to her mode&s;ty, told her he appre|hended he had touch'd the &s;tring that made mo&s;t harmony in her &s;oul; that &s;he &s;hould have not only his con&s;ent, but ap|probation; and that &s;he could not oblige him in a more eminent degree than to e&s;pou&s;e him with the utmo&s;t expedition, by which means &s;he would not only be made infinitely happy in a worthy hu&s;|band, but put an end to all future pre|ten&s;ions to her. Upon this declaration the lady was reliev'd from that re&s;traint, which an intire re&s;ignation to her father's will had laid upon her; and after &s;ome lit|tle pau&s;e, &s;he acknowledg'd Mr. Dumont had the greate&s;t intere&s;t with her of all the gentlemen who had paid their ad|dre&s;&s;es; but that &s;he &s;truggled very hard to &s;uppre&s;s a growing inclination, till &s;he could be fully a&s;&s;ur'd 'twas agreable to his lord&s;hip for her to entertain any thoughts of him that exceeded the bounds of friend&s;hip; but &s;ince the Count had gene|rou&s;ly given a &s;anction to her regard, &s;he confe&s;s'd &s;he was ready to receive Mr.
<PB N="12" REF="22">
Dumont for a hu&s;band whenever he thought proper to command it.</P>
<P>This affair being agreeably concluded, they pa&s;t on their journey very plea&s;ingly, di&s;cour&s;ing chiefly on the happine&s;s they propos'd in the intended alliance.</P>
<P>After near two days travelling, they arriv'd at his lord&s;hip's &s;eat, on which (as is cu&s;tomary on &s;uch occa&s;ions) the bells were &s;et a ringing. Mr. Dumont, who lived within half a mile, enquired the cau&s;e; when being inform'd the Count and lady Charlotte were come down, he flew with impatient fondne&s;s to the idol of his wi&s;hes, and was &s;oon made ac|quainted with the rea&s;on of their un|expected arrival. When he heard the de&s;ign that was form'd again&s;t the virtue of his adored mi&s;tre&s;s, he felt the mo&s;t ex|qui&s;ite pain that indignation and revenge could po&s;&s;ibly excite. And what aggra|vated the torture he &s;uffer'd on this ac|count, was being dive&s;ted of the power of &s;acrificing to his rage, the author of the intended villainy; he thought he could ne|ver &s;ufficiently applaud the prudent con|duct of the peer in withdrawing his daugh|ter from the &s;ight of him who would have
<PB N="13" REF="23">
done her &s;o irreparable an injury: and when Lady Charlotte had quitted the room, he took that opportunity to urge his &s;uit, and what encouraged him to pre&s;s it more &s;trongly than before, he ob&s;erved that Lady Charlotte received him with more freedom than u&s;ual, &s;till pre&s;erving the ne|ce&s;&s;ary dignity of her &s;ex. The Count who had a &s;incere re&s;pect for this young gen|tleman, would not keep him in &s;u&s;pence, but &s;oon declared all that was needful to convince him of his &s;ucce&s;s; the tran&s;port|ed lover was then as much di&s;tracted with joy, as he had been ju&s;t before with immoderate rage.</P>
<P>After &s;upper the Count related to his daughter, Mr. Dumont's reque&s;t; and as there had been a twelve months court&s;hip before, he thought, as all par|ties were agreed, there needed no farther ceremony than to fix the day for their nuptials, which was celebrated with great pomp in about ten days after.</P>
<P>Mr. Dumont was po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of a fortune almo&s;t equal to the Count's; but the trifling deficiency was more than made up in his excellent character, that we may &s;ay of
<PB N="14" REF="24">
him;
<Q>&startq;prai&s;e could not &s;peak his &endq;worth.</Q></P>
<P>During their ab&s;ence &s;everal enquiries were made after the Count's illne&s;s; and letters &s;ent to the young lady, with pro|mi&s;es of half the kingdom upon her grant|ing his maje&s;ty's reque&s;t.</P>
<P>Mr Evelyn pretended the Count's violent indi&s;po&s;ition obliged the young lady to give clo&s;e attendance; that &s;he would &s;ee no company t$ll her papa's recovery; but if the gentleman would plea&s;e to intru&s;t him with the letters, he would faithfully deliver them at a proper opportunity; which indeed he did to the Count, accord|ing to order; whether by bribery of one of the &s;ervants or by what means is unknown, but the count's fictitious ill|ne&s;s was di&s;cover'd, and his &s;udden journey reach'd the King's ear, who grew outragious, and &s;ent an order for his immediate return. A courier was ac|cordingly di&s;patch'd to his lord&s;hip, who &s;ignified his maje&s;ty's di&s;plea&s;ure for ha|ving giving out a fal&s;e report of his being ill, only to e&s;trange him&s;elf from court; and expected his appearance there with utmo&s;t expedition; the Count &s;ent his
<PB N="15" REF="25">
duty, with a promi&s;e to &s;et out next day, leaving behind him the happy pair, who waited with impatient concern for his return.</P>
<P>The news of Lady Charlotte's marriage drove the love &s;ick monarch almo&s;t di&s;tracted, and many more of her ad|mirers into a&s;toni&s;hment and de&s;pair. The &s;econd day's journey the Count was met upon the road by Mr. Evelyn, to inform him of the revenge the king had meditated again&s;t him, and would fain have per&s;waded him to go back again; to which the intrepid Count replied, to what end? When the king can convince me, that he has a better title to do me an injury, than I have to prevent it, I will begin to fear him; but as I know him to be the offender, I have no rea&s;on to dread or to avoid him. I own, &s;aid Mr. Evelyn, your lord&s;hip's cau&s;e is ju&s;t; and hope you will excu&s;e in me a zealous regard, which gratitude and duty equally compel. The Count a&s;&s;ur'd him, he received his caution as he meant it, but declar'd no earthly power &s;hould re&s;train him from &s;eeing the King, which he did the very night he got to Ver&s;ailles.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="26">When he entered the royal apartment, his maje&s;ty looking &s;ternly at him de|manded the cau&s;e of his ill treatment of him; to which the Count begged he would explain him&s;elf, for he declared that he was mo&s;t truly firm in his allegiance, which nothing ever could &s;hake or violate; and that he could not conceive in what point he had offended. Not offended! replied the king! when in contempt of all the offered honours which I courted you to receive, you ba&s;ely and meanly urged a fal&s;ehood to avoid me; did that wear a face of loyalty? The greate&s;t, replied the count, I po&s;&s;ibly could &s;how, in preventing your maje&s;ty from running into the mo&s;t apparent evils, which the utmo&s;t joys they could have afforded, would never compen&s;ate for the inexpre&s;&s;ible compunction you mu&s;t have felt upon cool reflection: Con&s;ider, royal Sir, your office here is &s;o nice a repre&s;entation of heavenly power, that one bad action would fully a thou&s;and virtues; and that you are not here as regulator only, but de&s;ign'd an exem|plary good to all mankind. I need not be more explicit on the theme which has
<PB N="17" REF="27" MS="Y">
thrown me under your maje&s;ty's di&s;plea|&s;ure, but &s;hall refer my&s;elf to your cooler judgment, whether I have not acted like a prudent father, and a true &s;ubject; which characters, I &s;hall ever think it my duty to &s;upport to a religious &s;trictne&s;s.</P>
<P>The King being &s;en&s;ible his friendly of|fers to the Count were only the effects of an ill grounded pa&s;&s;ion, could urge no|thing to enforce the ju&s;tice of his cau&s;e; and that what the Count had &s;aid to him, was a nece&s;&s;ary and tender reproach for the &s;tain he would have thrown upon his own honour and dignity, by a cruel abu&s;e of a lady of the mo&s;t exalted vir|tue. This reflection &s;oftned the fury of his temper, and reduced it to its native &s;weetne&s;s; then &s;miling on the Count, my Lord, &s;aid he, I mu&s;t ac|knowledge your noblene&s;s of &s;oul in regard to this affair gives you &s;uch a &s;uperiority over me, that I cannot think it le&s;&s;ens, but will rather be an addition to great|ne&s;s to confe&s;s my error, and implore your pardon, and al&s;o that of the beau|teous Lady Charlotte, whom I can never &s;ufficiently make amends, for the wrong my unruly pa&s;&s;ion would have done her;

but as an earne&s;t of my contrition, and &s;incere de&s;ire of a la&s;ting innocent friend|&s;hip, beg your lord&s;hip to prevail on her to wear this trifle for my &s;ake; taking a ring from his finger of immen&s;e value, which he gave to the Count, a&s;&s;uring him at the &s;ame time he had he feared an invincible foe to combat with; adding, that he never knew the de&s;potick power of love before. However, in re&s;pect to the lady as well as from a regard to his own quiet, he would u&s;e his utmo&s;t efforts to &s;ubdue, what at that time had ab&s;olutely conquered him.</P>
<P>The Count took leave of his Maje&s;ty, whom he never &s;aw after; the rea&s;on of which the reader will &s;oon be informed; the next day he &s;et out for his country &s;eat, where he had left the new married happy pair, who waited with impatience for his return to compleat their joy, and to be &s;atisfied of the re&s;ult of his expedi|tion to court.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II. The Count returns to his Country Seat. A Proof of the Uncertainty of earthly <HI>Happine&s;s</HI>.</HEAD>
<P>EARLY next morning, the count &s;et out to his &s;eat; his impatience to return, occa&s;ioned his going po&s;t, where being arrived, he was received by the happy Dumont and his lady with ineffable tran&s;port, to whom he impart|ed all that happened at court; pre&s;ent|ing Lady Charlotte with his maje&s;ty's to|ken of repentant friend&s;hip; which &s;he had no &s;ooner received, than &s;he de&s;ired her &s;pou&s;e to wear it in her &s;tead, it be|ing &s;o large a brilliant, &s;he thought it a more proper ornament for a gentleman's, than a lady's finger. At the &s;ame time, reque&s;ting both the Count and Mr. Du|mont never to in&s;i&s;t upon her appearance at court, and &s;ignified her fondne&s;s for retirement; alledging, that the mea&s;ure of her joys were full, in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of
<PB N="20" REF="30">
the be&s;t of fathers, and worthe&s;t hu&s;|band; and 'twas impo&s;&s;ible for her to receive any addition to her happine&s;s.</P>
<P>This boon was directly granted, and orders &s;ent to Ver&s;ailles, for Mr. and Mrs. Evelyn to join this happy family; and to leave one of the Count's &s;tewards with three or four tru&s;ty &s;ervants, to look after the e&s;tate.</P>
<P>Upon this &s;ummons they in&s;tantly removed, greatly pleas'd at Lady Char|lotte's choice of a retired life.</P>
<P>In about two months time, &s;he proved with child, which con&s;iderably aug|mented the joy of her father, and the fond Dumont; who&s;e conjugal love and tenderne&s;s was unprecedented, as were the valuable qualifications of the adored object of his wi&s;hes; 'tis nothing to &s;ay, they &s;tudied to make each other happy, nature having formed them with that unanimity, their thoughts and actions flowed from one con&s;tant &s;pring of ever during love.</P>
<P>When they had been about a twelve-month married, they were ble&s;&s;ed with the birth of a lovely boy, who is the &s;ubject of the following &s;heets.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="31" MS="Y">After the de&s;cription of their happine&s;s in each other, a detail of this additional tran&s;port, would be but an impertinent intru&s;ion on the reader's time and pa|tience. But alas! how uncertain are the joys of the mo&s;t happy, while in a &s;tate of mortality?</P>
<P>This lady had not lain in above a fort|night, before &s;he was &s;eized with the &s;mall-pox; which in a very few days, put a period to her life.</P>
<P>The new born babe receiv'd the infec|tion; tho', in &s;o favourable a manner, it &s;oon recovered; but the unhappy fa|ther, &s;ubdued by exce&s;&s;ive grief, with a broken heart expired; and that &s;o &s;ud|denly, they were in one day with great funeral pomp entombed together.</P>
<P>Now, gentle reader, I leave your own imagination to paint the perpetual gloom of &s;orrow, the &s;urviving father mu&s;t endure from &s;uch a lo&s;s; and which, but that of the tender offspring of this lamented pair, was &s;pared to alleviate his woe, might have been the fatal cau&s;e of his decea&s;e. But providence had otherwi&s;e ordained it, for the &s;ake
<PB N="22" REF="32">
of the little orphan, whom more than life he loved; and amply te&s;tified his affection in his paternal care.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the mournful ob&s;equies were ended, the count re&s;olved to quit the kingdom; not being able to bear the place where he had pa&s;&s;ed &s;o many happy years of &s;oft paternal dalliance, with his dear and only child; the lo&s;s of whom, and his worthy &s;on in law, render'd him incon&s;oleable.</P>
<P>Mr. Evelyn was di&s;patched to Ver|&s;ailles, with an addre&s;s to his maje&s;ty, in order to obtain leave for the Count's departure from France; having de&s;ign'd, with his royal permi&s;&s;ion, to pa&s;s the remaining part of his life in England.</P>
<P>The king bore no &s;mall &s;hare in his di&s;tre&s;s, and complimented the memory of the deceas'd lady, with an order for a court mourning; which continued for one month, &s;he being by her mother's &s;ide, a di&s;tant relation to the blood-royal.</P>
<P>His maje&s;ty expre&s;&s;ed a tender concern for his lord&s;hip's misfortune, and was &s;orry he had &s;o melancholy an occa&s;ion to te&s;tifie his readine&s;s to oblige him;
<PB N="23" REF="33" MS="Y">
and &s;ince his grief was un&s;urmountable, rather than run the hazard of &s;hortening his days, by &s;taying in France, he freely gave him leave to embark for England, in hopes that time and ab&s;ence might di&s;|&s;ipate his angui&s;h, and prolong his life.</P>
<P>Mr. Evelyn was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed with leave from the King, under his own hand; which with the utmo&s;t expedition he brought to the Count.</P>
<P>It happened Mrs. Evelyn was deliver|ed of a daughter, about a week after Lady Charlotte Dumont was brought to bed of her &s;on; which retarded their voyage to England, till &s;he was capable of being moved; in which time the Count &s;ettled his affairs, and being ap|prehen&s;ive he &s;hould not long &s;urvive his darling child; was careful in provi|ding for Mi&s;s Evelyn, who&s;e father's merit claimed the &s;tronge&s;t regard; for which rea&s;on, he pre&s;ented the in|fant with five thou&s;and pounds on their arrival; which when &s;he came to age, was doubled by a growing intere&s;t.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. III. The Count arrives in <HI>England;</HI> &s;ettles near <HI>London</HI>.</HEAD>
<P>MRS Evelyn's month being up, and the count's affairs fini&s;hed, he embarked for England; taking with him only Mr. and Mrs. Evelyn, the new born infants, and their nur&s;es; with Latour his gentleman, who attend|ed him when he was at &s;chool, in the quality of a footman; but from his good behaviour, was preferred, when his lord&s;hip came to age, to the foremen|tioned po&s;t.</P>
<P>By a favourable gale, they were &s;afely and &s;uddenly conducted to Dover; from thence they were e&s;corted to London. Mr. Evelyn directly hired a ready furni&s;hed hou&s;e for the family in Pall-Mall, till by the count's order he had found out an agreeable retreat in the country, which he &s;oon effected; and pur|chas'd an e&s;tate at a place called Iver,
<PB N="25" REF="35" MS="Y">
within three miles of Uxbridge, about twenty one from London.</P>
<P>In a &s;hort time the Count &s;ettled there with a determination to become an ab|&s;olute reclu&s;e; and as his grand&s;on grew up, who was his only care and comfort, made his wellfare the bu&s;ine&s;s of his life; which that he might effectually ac|compli&s;h, he delivered him up to Mr. Evelyn as &s;oon as he became of an age &s;ufficient to receive in&s;tructions.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Evelyn was no le&s;s regarded by this noble lord, who allowed a &s;alary to her parents to educate her, as his adopted daughter, by which means &s;he was qualified for a court, with the ne|ce&s;&s;ary accompli&s;hments that afterwards enabled her to govern a family; the plea|&s;ure the Count received from the daily and vi&s;ible improvement made in the&s;e tender blo&s;&s;oms, con&s;iderably alleviated his grief, and gave him early hopes of their &s;oon becoming the full blown flowers of perfection.</P>
<P>The young gentleman often &s;olicited his Grand papa, to con&s;ent to his taking a tour thro' France and Italy, but the Count would by no means li&s;ten to that
<PB N="26" REF="36">
propo&s;al; declaring that he would have him thoroughly acquainted with the coun|try he was bred in, before he went abroad; that when he had compleated his &s;tudies Mr. Evelyn &s;hould accompany him to all the remarkable places in England, that he might be able to give an account of them; for though, &s;aid the Count, you are not a native here, you'll have as much expected from you in regard to the knowledge of this kingdom as if you were; having, &s;ix weeks excepted, pa&s;&s;ed your life in it.</P>
<P>I have experienced the di&s;advantages young gentlemen have labour'd under, by being &s;ent abroad before they had re|ceived the nece&s;&s;ary qualifications for their travels; which not only rendred them&s;elves ridiculous, but throws an odium upon a glorious country, which is capable of producing as great genius's as any in Europe, were they &s;uffer'd to take a proper time for cultivation, before they launch into the world; the want of which regard, is the rea&s;on why &s;o many of the Engli&s;h youth &s;et out pert blockheads, and return accompli&s;h'd a&s;&s;es; which unhappy management has
<PB N="27" REF="37">
laid the foundation of ruin for many a fine woman, and fair e&s;tate, by falling into the hands of the&s;e unfini&s;h'd, mo|dern fine gentlemen; and that you, my dear Harry, may not &s;well the number of their account, I tenderly admoni&s;h you to lay a&s;ide all thoughts of vi&s;iting any foreign country, till your friends &s;hall judge it proper; and you are able to convince the people abroad, that your expedition was rather occa&s;ion'd by cu|rio&s;ity, than a want of improvement.</P>
<P>The good youth, who&s;e highe&s;t hap|pine&s;s con&s;i&s;ted in obeying his worthy grand&s;ire, from that time, without re|luctance, gave up all thoughts of travel|ling; and that his complacency of temper might meet both with reward and en|couragement, the Count gave him free liberty to enjoy all the innocent and po|lite plea&s;ures of life; and though his lord&s;hip &s;eldom went abroad him&s;elf, he permitted both the children to go to court, a&s;&s;emblies, balls, operas, and plays, as they lived &s;o near London, but con|&s;tantly attended by Mr. and Mrs. Evelyn; young Dumont and Mi&s;s were great Lo|vers of dramatick performances, and pre|vail'd
<PB N="28" REF="38">
upon his Lord&s;hip to let them have a compleat theatre built at the end of a green walk; where &s;everal young La|dies and Gentlemen formed a company of comedians, and exhibited many of Shake&s;pear's and Moliere's plays; nor was Terence excluded; who&s;e Comedies were generally acted by the male part of their &s;ociety, except &s;ometimes Mi&s;s Eve|lyn, who was perfect mi&s;tre&s;s of the Latin tongue, took an occa&s;ional part to fill up their number: between the acts &s;he fre|quently entertain'd the nobility and gen|try (who form'd their audience) with a &s;ong or a le&s;&s;on on the harp&s;ichord, in which &s;he equal'd the mo&s;t &s;killful pro|ficients of the age; their choice of this kind of amu&s;ement pleas'd the Count extremely, as it was both innocent and in&s;tructive, allowing the &s;tage to be a kind of &s;eminary in it&s;elf, and capable of refining the under&s;tandings, both of the performer and &s;pectators, and in &s;ome degree cultivate a natural genius, which might unfortunately want the ble&s;&s;ing and a&s;&s;i&s;tance of a regular education.</P>

<P>MR. Dumont having attain'd to the age of fifteen, gave daily and di|&s;tingui&s;hing proofs of his growing vir|tues; the precepts and examples of his tender parent, and careful governor, having formed his mind, and rai&s;ed it to &s;uch a glorious height of perfection, he was de&s;ervedly accounted and e&s;teem'd the mirror of the age; among the num|ber of his excellent qualities, that of hu|manity was not the lea&s;t, which this chapter will di&s;cover: he had the bravery of the Engli&s;h, the politene&s;s of the French, but in the foremention'd virtue he was con&s;iderably indebted to the Iri&s;h, who are remarkably beneficent to all who&s;e misfortunes have any claim to their pity or redre&s;s; the friendle&s;s &s;tranger on the fir&s;t application is di&s;charged from the burden of his affliction, by the gene|rous
<PB N="30" REF="40">
natives of that kingdom, the freedom and chearful ea&s;e with which they admi|ni&s;ter comfort to the wretched, redoubles the merit of their bounty. I beg pardon for this digre&s;&s;ion, which I hope will be excu&s;ed, &s;ince it is occa&s;ion'd by an ear|ne&s;t de&s;ire of doing ju&s;tice to a &s;et of worthy per&s;ons, who&s;e generous &s;ouls are ever &s;trongly affected with the mi&s;eries of their fellow creatures, and think them|&s;elves ble&s;s'd while they exert their power to a&s;&s;wage, or totally di&s;&s;ipate their &s;or|rows. I could wi&s;h this laudable exam|ple, &s;o truly great, was more general in this kingdom, I mean an exten&s;ion of it among the middling &s;ort of people, tho' in Ireland, even POVERTY lays no re|&s;traint upon the mind of the mo&s;t in|digent, who, far as their &s;mall pittance will allow, the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed are welcome to a friendly part. I hope the people of England won't conceive while I am gi|ving due prai&s;e to the Iri&s;h, that I would throw a general odium upon my own country; No! far be it from me to be guilty of &s;uch a calumny, I only &s;peak from the experience I have from many &s;trangers who have acknowledged the
<PB N="31" REF="41">
boundle&s;s favours they received from the Hibernians of high and low degree; nor have I been exempt from their bounty, as I have fully demon&s;trated in the &s;ub|ject of my narrative. I think a national gratitude incumbent on all who have the lea&s;t regard to humanity; and were the lower people here, more kind to &s;trangers, or their near acquaintance in di&s;tre&s;s, I am apt to believe two very great evils would be by that means avoided, the fir&s;t of which is an inhuman deprivation of that power to do good, which the great Ruler of the world has for our own ad|vantage be&s;tow'd upon us; the next is thro' pinching want and dire nece&s;&s;ity, reducing by our cruel par&s;imony a hap|le&s;s wretch to barter his hone&s;ty to &s;up|port a mi&s;erable life, which too often brings it to a &s;hameful period. As this reflection is not pointed at particulars, I hope I &s;han't incur any di&s;plea&s;ure, and that whoever may &s;tand in need of this hint, will make a proper u&s;e of it for their own &s;akes, as well as for the benefit of the NECESSITOUS part of the creation.</P>
<P>I &s;hall now proceed to give a &s;trong in&s;tance of this noble virtue in young Du|mont.

The young gentleman and his governor on their return from hunting one morning, being caught in a &s;udden and violent &s;hower of rain, rode up to a little hovel, built for the reception of cattle, upon Wind&s;or-fore&s;t; they di&s;|mounted and enter'd this friendly &s;helter, where to their mutual amazement, they found a beautiful boy about fourteen years of age, plainly, but genteely dre&s;s'd, wringing his little hands, and in all ap|pearance ready to expire thro' exce&s;s of grief; they immediately enquired into the cau&s;e of his lamentation, but the un|happy youth was entirely di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of the power to an&s;wer their demands, a flood of tears and bittere&s;t &s;obs broke in upon his &s;peech, which for &s;ome time he vainly attempted to recover; the gentle|men being anxious to know the meaning of this immoderate &s;orrow, patiently wai|ted till the child was capable of informing them of the cau&s;e; which he began by telling them, that he was, without excep|tion, the mo&s;t wretched of the whole creation. I la&s;t week, &s;aid he, buried a tender and indulgent mother, &s;he was a widow, left by my father but in indifferent

circum&s;tances, he was a gentleman of a moderate fortune, who from an exce&s;s of good nature impair'd his income, by being frequently bound for others debts, which reduced him to the nece&s;&s;ity of mortgaging the little e&s;tate we lived in to a younger brother of his, who had a legacy left him by a di&s;tant relation at the very time my father was drove to this misfortune: in &s;hort my uncle who is the very rever&s;e of the de&s;cription I have given you of my father, lent him three hundred pounds upon the hou&s;e and ground, with a &s;ordid view of becoming ab&s;olutely ma&s;ter of it, from the hopes of my father's never being able to redeem it, tho' the e&s;tate is valued at a thou&s;and pounds; in &s;hort my father died &s;oon after this affair happen'd, leaving my mo|ther in a di&s;tracted condition to contrive a means to &s;upport her&s;elf and me, who was then but two years of age; however providence put it in her power to get not only a livelihood by keeping a little &s;hop and a day &s;chool for young ladies to learn particular fine works, but &s;he was al&s;o enabled to give me an education beyond what might have been expected from

the melancholy &s;ituation &s;he was left in. Mr. Evelyn interrupted him with en|quiring what &s;ort of education his mother had be&s;towed on him; to which the youth replied, what I believe, Sir, you will allow to be a good one, and as much as is ne|ce&s;&s;ary for one in my &s;tation of life, ha|ving been in the Greek form for near a twelve-month before my mother died; here the haple&s;s child, again o'ercome by fre&s;h &s;treams of grief, and deep fetch'd &s;ighs paus'd a while. When his tears gave way proceeded in his &s;tory, with many tender expre&s;&s;ions of gratitude, for the great care his decea&s;ed mother had taken in the bringing of him up, and that he thought him&s;elf under treble obligations to her, as he was very &s;en&s;ible &s;he denied her&s;elf many nece&s;&s;aries of life to be&s;tow the larger &s;hare of her &s;mall pittance upon him. Now, gentlemen, I mu&s;t inform you that this uncle of mine is a man of neither principle nor humanity, as you will find by the &s;equel of my &s;tory, which con&s;train'd my dear mother to part from many things of value, to pay the intere&s;t of this mortgage; which &s;he did, till &s;ickne&s;s, in which &s;he lingered for near
<PB N="35" REF="45">
fifteen months, di&s;empowered her to con|tinue the payment; as &s;oon as it plea&s;ed heaven to deprive me of her, this cruel uncle came and took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of all I was worth in the world, and before my face, borrowed a &s;um of money on the e&s;tate, of a per&s;on he brought with him for that purpo&s;e; when I a&s;k'd the rea&s;on of this barbarous proceeding, and beg'd him to forgoe the wrong he was doing me, he was regardle&s;s of my &s;up|plication, and with brutal rage, cruelly in&s;ulted my di&s;tre&s;s; then with his hor&s;e|whip &s;everely drove me out of doors to beg or &s;tarve, threatning me with death if ever I pre&s;umed to come near the hou&s;e again. How, &s;aid Dumont, had you no friend to take your part in this extre|mity? None, Sir, replied the Lad, but my &s;chool-ma&s;ter, who endeavouring to defend me from the dreadful la&s;hes of his whip, received a fatal blow, which in&s;tantly &s;truck out his eye, and I fear the other is much endanger'd. I have &s;ecreted my&s;elf in this melancholly retreat the&s;e &s;ix and thirty hours, nor have I &s;een the face of a living &s;oul till now, and whither to go, or what cour&s;e to take,

I know not. Then the dread of meeting my uncle, &s;ometimes makes me re&s;olve not to quit it, but patiently re&s;ign my&s;elf to grief and want, till the friendly hand of death &s;hall end my wretched life.</P>
<P>Mr. Dumont was &s;o affected with the youth's di&s;tre&s;s, and &s;en&s;ible deportment, that he determin'd to be his friend, bidding him take comfort, and would have per|&s;waded him to have gone back with them to this inhuman wretch; which offer the boy would on no terms accept, but with a thankful mode&s;ty declined it; adding, that if they were doubtful of the truth of what he had a&s;&s;erted, if they plea&s;ed to have farther conviction of it, he would direct them where to go, and hear the melancholly tale retold by Mr. Williams, the unfortunate man who lo&s;t his eye in his defence. This was readily agreed to by Mr. Dumont and his governor, and taking directions from him they &s;et out, leaving one of his &s;ervants behind to get &s;omething at the next village to recruit the &s;pirits of the oppre&s;s'd infant, and accom|pany him till their return; they rode with full &s;peed, with an ab&s;olute deter|mination to bring the uncle to ju&s;tice for

his inhuman treatment of an innocent boy; but when they came they found the hou&s;e &s;hut up, and upon enquiry were told, the villain had &s;old off all the goods the day before, and went off the moment the &s;ale was over; they proceeded then to the &s;chool-ma&s;ter, whom they found in great agony from the lo&s;s of his eye, which was con&s;iderably augmented by the grief he &s;u&s;tain'd for the hard u&s;age and lo&s;s of the poor boy, who&s;e character was related to Dumont in a mo&s;t affectionate and tender manner, and be&s;poke that care and fond regard he afterwards met with in the Count's family; which was no &s;mall joy to the good tutor to hear his little pupil had fallen into &s;uch honoura|ble hands. Mr. Dumont took leave of the good man, and left him ten guineas that he might not want proper a&s;&s;i&s;tance in this unhappy exigence; the eager de|&s;ire this noble youth had to relieve the afflicted, redoubled his ha&s;te; when he return'd to the child, whom he &s;miling bid to be of comfort, ordering one of the &s;ervants to take him before him on hor&s;e-back, and conduct him &s;afely to the Count's. When they got home young

Dumont left the child with Mr. Evelyn below &s;tairs, while he went to his grand papa's apartment and gave him the hi&s;tory of the poor abandon'd orphan; not for|getting the fair character the ma&s;ter gave him, with which the good Count was no le&s;s delighted than his grand&s;on, and was plea&s;ed to find this early proof of his hu|manity to a worthy object of compa&s;&s;ion. Young Dumont &s;oon found that intrea|ties on the lad's behalf were needle&s;s, from the profound attention he gave to the re|cital of his &s;tory, and the tender effect it had upon his generous mind, which di&s;|covered it&s;elf by his involuntary &s;ighs; the child was &s;ent for up, who&s;e melan|cholly and &s;en&s;ible a&s;pect, mixed with a &s;weetne&s;s of behaviour, directly influenced the Count in his favour, who from that in&s;tant protected and bred him as his adopted &s;on; his education in which he had made a great progre&s;s when under Mr. Williams's tuition, was compleated by the &s;uperior judgment of Mr Evelyn, who was allow'd to be without exception one of the mo&s;t learned gentlemen the age produced.</P>

Five years pa&s;t on, in which time an uninterrupted cour&s;e of friend&s;hip was worthily and &s;olemnly con|tracted between the&s;e young gentlemen; one day as they were walking in the garden, Jennings appear'd &s;omewhat un|ea&s;y, which Dumont di&s;covering in&s;i&s;ted upon being acquainted with the cau&s;e; which the other for &s;ome time declined to &s;atisfy him of, till Dumont urged him by the &s;trict bonds of friend&s;hip, what|ever was his unea&s;ine&s;s, to impart it to his friend.

My honour'd and much valued friend, &s;aid he, when I think of &s;eperating from you, it is equally terrible as what I mu&s;t have conceived of an unexpected and untimely &s;troke of death; but I have one rea&s;on in particular, which &s;trength|ens my re&s;olution of undergoing the dreadful pangs of parting with you; and in my turn mu&s;t beg you by the &s;ame ties of friend&s;hip, not to enquire into it, or wi&s;h to know it till you have it under my own hand in my fir&s;t letter after my departure; which he faithfully promi&s;ing &s;hould be the ca&s;e, his generous friend would not per&s;i&s;t in endeavouring to find it out, though his curio&s;ity was rai&s;ed to the highe&s;t pitch; one motive he own'd for going, was a violent de&s;ire to con|vince his worthy friends that their kind indulgence had not buried in him the thoughts of indu&s;try, but rather prompt|ed him to exert him&s;elf in that re&s;pect, that they might &s;ee their tender care was not lo&s;t or thrown away upon him; and that he thought it his duty, and the only grateful in&s;tance he could give of his &s;en&s;e of all their favours to become no longer burthen&s;ome, &s;ince they had &s;o

<P>Dumont would fain have per&s;uaded him to &s;tay, affirming to him that fortune &s;hould never be wanting to continue him with them: that, Sir, I am well a&s;&s;ured on, replied young Jennings, and I am not to learn that your affluence is &s;uffici|ent to make many more &s;uch objects of compa&s;&s;ion truly happy; but notwith&s;tand|ing that, I cannot reconcile it to my&s;elf to remain an unnece&s;&s;ary burden to &s;uch valu|able friends, when I may employ my time in &s;ome indu&s;trious calling that may do honour to my noble benefactors, who em|powered me to make the laudable pur&s;uit; and to convince you farther, Sir, that I mu&s;t think my propo&s;ition ju&s;t, the Count con&s;ented to it, and gave Mr. Eve|lyn orders to agree with Mr. Bryan the We&s;t-India merchant that vi&s;its here, to take me as his clerk, and to furni&s;h me with every thing proper for my voyage, if I could prevail on you to approve of my de&s;ign. Mr. Dumont told him that was the la&s;t thing in the world he &s;hould have wi&s;h'd or expected; but as he found him &s;o intent upon the affair, he would

The affair being concluded, the young gentleman was equip'd with every thing not only nece&s;&s;ary, but perfectly genteel, and the generous Count gave into the hands of Mr. Bryan, who was a man of undoubted worth, the &s;um of five hun|dred pounds, to be di&s;po&s;ed of in mer|chandizing, as a little fortune for him when he had &s;erved his clerk&s;hip.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WERE it po&s;&s;ible for me more than in words to expre&s;s the &s;atis|faction and ineffable joy I po&s;&s;e&s;s in the honour of your unbounded friend&s;hip,
<PB N="44" REF="54">
I &s;hould be proud to do it, even at Life's expence, and e&s;teem it but as a trifling return, for the innumerable in&s;tances of your unprecedented ten|derne&s;s; the repeated obligations con|ferred on me by your noble grand|fire, and worthy &s;elf, are the plea&s;ing contemplations of my mind. Nor can I ever &s;ufficiently acknowledge the friendly care of my ever Honoured Ma&s;ter Mr. Evelyn, who&s;e con&s;tant a&s;&s;iduity in my education, &s;hall meet with a la&s;ting gratitude from his affectionate pupil.</P>
<P>I &s;hall now, dear &s;ir, keep my word in giving you the rea&s;on of my fir&s;t re|&s;olution to travel, but mu&s;t conjure you &s;ir, to forgive my encouraging a fond delu&s;ive pa&s;&s;ion, which was aimed at a lovely object, far above my hopes &mdash; in a word, the beautiful and incom|parable Mi&s;s Evelyn, &mdash; now the &s;e|cret is divulg'd &mdash; I tremble, left my noble friend might have de&s;ign'd him|&s;elf to be the happy partner of her heart; the dread of which obliged me to &s;mother up a flame, that had like to have given a period to my life. Then
<PB N="45" REF="55">
as I was con&s;cious, none could be &s;o worthy of her as your&s;elf; and that my haple&s;s fate, had ca&s;t me far beneath her, I thought my&s;elf doubly bound in re&s;pect to the Lady, and gratitude to a much valued friend, to try to &s;uppre&s;s my growing love, which I find even ab&s;ence can't effect; but re|&s;olved on that as the mo&s;t likely remedy to mitigate the &s;ufferings of a de&s;pairing, and I fear a broken heart.</P>
<P>Dear &s;ir, let this unhappy &s;troke of fate, be buried in your bo&s;om; and be a&s;&s;ured, nothing but the fears of being thought guilty of black ingratitude, and di&s;-regard of the be&s;t of friends, &s;hould have drawn the &s;ecret from</P>

</LETTER>
<P>The grateful motive for his &s;tifling his pa&s;&s;ion, and the noble re&s;olution of ma|king
<PB N="46" REF="56">
him&s;elf a &s;acrifice, rather than wrong his friend, wrought &s;uch an effect upon Dumont, that notwith&s;tanding the in|junction laid on him not to di&s;clo&s;e the &s;ecret, he directly &s;hew'd the letter to the Count and Mr. Evelyn; in hopes the faithful youth might by that means ob|tain the dear reward for all his pain and generous concealment.</P>
<P>On the peru&s;al of Jennings's epi&s;tle to Dumont, the Count and Mr. Evelyn expre&s;&s;ed the tendere&s;t concern, but were unable to decide in his favour, as his happine&s;s or mi&s;ery was entirely de|pendant on Mi&s;s Evelyn's determination; in &s;hort, the whole family intere&s;ted them&s;elves &s;o far in his behalf, that they urged daily the merit of her lover; nor could &s;he make the lea&s;t objection to his per&s;on, which was entirely agreeable; and con&s;iderably heightened by a noble|ne&s;s of mind, rarely to be found.</P>
<P>And that want of fortune, might be no ob&s;truction to the crowning his wi&s;hes, the Count offered Mi&s;s Evelyn to double the fortune he gave her, when an infant, to make him worthy her ac|ceptance. But ala&s;s! poor Jennings,
<PB N="47" REF="57" MS="Y">
notwith&s;tanding &s;o many powerful ad|vocates, was ca&s;t in his &s;uit. For Mi&s;s Evelyn po&s;itively declined all thoughts of marriage; and as her own heart was not equally engag'd, &s;he entreated both the Count and her papa not to in&s;i&s;t with her compliance to their reque&s;t; ac|knowledging her&s;elf extreamly honoured, and obliged for the trouble they had given them&s;elves on the account; al|lowing at the &s;ame time, that Mr. Jennings was a youth of many promi&s;ing virtues; that &s;he &s;hould ever retain a grateful friend&s;hip for him, and was truly concerned at her being the un|happy, tho' innocent cau&s;e of his di&s;|tre&s;s.</P>
<P>Upon this declaration, the &s;ubject was dropped, for both the Count and Mr. Evelyn, thought it would be but a ridiculous cruelty to in&s;i&s;t upon obe|dience in an affair, where her own hap|pine&s;s was &s;o principally concerned. And as &s;he was in every other point perfectly re&s;igned to their wills, gratitude and af|fection equally compelled them, not to lay any violent re&s;traint on hers.</P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="58" MS="Y">Young Jenning's pa&s;&s;ion for Mi&s;s Evelyn, had &s;o noble an effect on his mind, that it enlarged and brightened tho&s;e qualifications art and nature had endowed him with; in every action of his life, he demon&s;trated how much he &s;tudied to de&s;erve her; in &s;hort, he was the univer&s;al admiration of the i&s;land in which he lived, and be|haved &s;o much beyond his ma&s;ter's ex|pectation, that he conver&s;ed with him as a friend, even in his voyage, and when his time was out, paying him the five hundred pounds given by the Count, he added as much more, with an offer to make him partner with him in mer|chandize; which Jennings declined, as as he was not po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a fortune &s;ufficient to undertake an affair of &s;o much con&s;equence.</P>
<P>But providence &s;oon made him a|mends for his generous refu&s;al, by the death of his ma&s;ter, who was &s;eized with a malignant fever in about &s;ix months after he had made Jennings this offer; and having no relations, left him his &s;ole heir, and ma&s;ter of five and twenty thou&s;and pounds.</P>
<P><PB N="49" REF="59" MS="Y">This augmentation of fortune encou|raged the amorous youth immediately to &s;end a letter to young Dumont, with a propo&s;al of marriage to Mi&s;s Evelyn; and to di&s;clo&s;e, as he thought, his long &s;tifled fondne&s;s; as bu&s;ine&s;s would not permit him to go over directly, he en|treated Dumont if he had no intention of an alliance there, that he would urge his pa&s;&s;ion to the utmo&s;t of his power; that the fears of being thought only an intere&s;ted lover, and the danger of of|fending his deare&s;t friends, had almo&s;t wrought his di&s;&s;olution. But as he had it now in his power to convince Mi&s;s Evelyn of the contrary of the former, and had been a&s;certained by Dumont's letters, that he run no hazard of the lat|ter; he entertained from his friend's interce&s;&s;ion &s;ome hopes of &s;ucce&s;s. But he was &s;oon a&s;&s;ur'd of the uncertain|ty of human happine&s;s, let the pro&s;pect be e'er &s;o fair and probable, for Mi&s;s Evelyn, &s;o far from inclining to his wi&s;hes, continued quite inexorable; nor could his Fortune prevail; which made the family &s;u&s;pect there was a &s;ecret rea&s;on for &s;o ab&s;olute a refu&s;al; and as
<PB N="50" REF="60">
they could not di&s;cover it by her behavi|our, they were re&s;olved not to make the lea&s;t inquiry, till time &s;hould give it birth.</P>
<P>Young Jennings did not fail to reward his old tutor, and worthy friend Mr. Williams, to whom he &s;ent a bill for a hundred pounds, drawn upon a mer|chant in the city of London, with an offer to come over to the Indies, or accept of a yearly remittance for life; but the fond old man was &s;o tran&s;ported at the thoughts of &s;eeing him, he rather cho&s;e to go over to him (not knowing that Mi&s;s Evelyn might, in all probability, have brought him &s;oon to England; and the Letter young Dumont &s;ent prevented his co|ming as he intended) the good man ar|rived in the Indies, to the real joy of his worthy friend, who by his grateful re|membrance of him relieved him from a laborious pur&s;uit of &s;upport, for at be&s;t but an unea&s;y life, and by his tender care render'd him happy during the re|maining part. That the old gentleman thought him&s;elf more than amply re|warded for all his &s;ufferings pa&s;t, and after a few years of uninterrupted tran|quility,
<PB N="51" REF="61">
ended his life, with a grateful &s;en&s;e of his Creator's goodne&s;s, who not only ble&s;s'd his latter days, but gave him the inexpre&s;&s;ible delight to &s;ee his child (as he always called him) rai&s;ed to &s;uch a wondrous height of happine&s;s, and po&s;|&s;e&s;s'd of &s;uch virtues as might enable him to retain and to de&s;erve it.</P>
<P>Poor Mr. Jennings remained for &s;ome time very melancholly for the lo&s;s of his dear ma&s;ter, which he called him to the hour of his death; and his di&s;tre&s;s was, in a great mea&s;ure, aggravated in the want of a friend, to whom he could un|bo&s;om his mind. His love to Mi&s;s Evelyn having made &s;o deep an impre&s;|&s;ion on his heart, that life became a burden to him, nor could even riches make the lea&s;t amends for the &s;malle&s;t of his &s;ufferings.</P>
<P>One day a gentleman, in the cour&s;e of conver&s;ation, a&s;k'd him why he would not marry, and told him he was very &s;en&s;ible that he had met with the greate&s;t offers of any per&s;on in the whole i&s;land; upon which Mr. Jennings proceeded to give the rea&s;on why he had declined the acceptation of every propo&s;al of marriage
<PB N="52" REF="62" MS="Y">
that had been made to him. When after a profound attention given by the gen|tleman to what Jennings had recited, my dear friend, &s;aid he, I know a beau|tiful virgin in this i&s;land who &s;uffers as much for you as you endure from the lady's refu&s;al in England. She is a per&s;on of no great fortune, but her worth, as a girl of &s;en&s;e, and exemplary virtue, puts her upon an equality with the be&s;t e&s;tate in Europe; and &s;ince you are certain you cannot be happy with her you love, e'en make Her happy whom you may be a&s;|&s;ured wi&s;hes to make you &s;o.</P>
<P>Mr. Jennings could not &s;o &s;uddenly acquie&s;ce with his friend's reque&s;t, but de&s;ired a little con&s;ideration on the affair, and to be acquinted with the young lady which his friend entreated might be &s;oon, otherwi&s;e it was po&s;&s;ible a few days might end her life and mi&s;ery to|gether.</P>
<P>Young Jennings knew too well the power of love not to bear a part in the lady's affliction, and appointed a day for an interview with the enamour'd fair one; re&s;olving, if &s;he were but tolerably agree|able, to marry her, as being the mo&s;t
<PB N="53" REF="63" MS="Y">
likely means to overcome his violent pa&s;&s;ion for the other. According to ap|pointment, he went to pay his re&s;pects to his friend, where he &s;aw the lady, who&s;e beauty was rather heightned than impair'd in his opinion, by a melancholly &s;weetne&s;s in her countenance; and the &s;urprize and joy of &s;eeing Him &s;he &s;e|cretly loved, revived the faded ro&s;es in her cheeks. The gentleman of the hou&s;e (who was a di&s;tant relation, and guardian to this lady and a younger &s;i&s;ter) had drop'd a di&s;tant hint of Jennings's in|tended vi&s;it, but not a &s;yllable of the de|&s;ign of it, lea&s;t it &s;hould fail, and render the poor creature more wretched than before. However, her tran&s;port at the &s;ight of him was too &s;trong to permit her to &s;tay in the room, from which &s;he was &s;carce retired to another, but &s;he fainted in her cou&s;in's arms; who per|ceiving her unea&s;ine&s;s, had follow'd her out, when, after bringing her to her&s;elf, he return'd alone to Mr. Jennings, and told him by what means they became acquainted with her pa&s;&s;ion for him; you mu&s;t know, &s;aid he, &s;he has a pretty turn to poetry, and being in&s;pired by
<PB N="54" REF="64">
love, wrote a copy of ver&s;es upon your wor&s;hip, which &s;he accidentally drop|ping, her little &s;i&s;ter found and gave to me. I confe&s;s I could not blame her, as &s;he had &s;o luckily be&s;towed her heart on one, whom no woman need blu&s;h at ad|miring; but the uncertainty of being &s;ucce&s;sful in her love, made me endea|vour, by gentle means, to di&s;&s;wade her from the pur&s;uit of a hopele&s;s pa&s;&s;ion. But ala&s;s, in vain were my admonitions! I &s;oon found her fondne&s;s had taken &s;uch root, that it prey'd upon her mind, and I fear will end in her di&s;&s;olution. Not if I can prevent it, replied Mr. Jennings; perhaps fate has &s;teel'd Mi&s;s Evelyn's heart again&s;t me, as a means to make another happy who has a better claim to my regard than that cruel beauty; and &s;ince your kin&s;woman has honour'd me with &s;o tender an affection, gratitude compels me to endeavour to transfer my unbounded &s;tock of love for Mi&s;s Evelyn to her, who will meet it with a propor|tionable &s;hare on her &s;ide.</P>
<P>This re&s;olution gave the gentleman great &s;atisfaction, as he knew they were worthy of each other, and that it would
<PB N="55" REF="65" MS="Y">
happily put an end to a very trouble&s;ome and dangerous fit of love that might have co&s;t both their lives.</P>
<P>Mr. Jennings was &s;o cautious of giving her the lea&s;t &s;u&s;picion of his knowing what intere&s;t he had in her heart, that he addre&s;s'd her with all the &s;eeming dread of a denial; nor was his mind tainted with that vanity and pre&s;uming power the young fellows of this age are too naturally prone to on &s;uch occa&s;ions; &s;o far from it, tho' he was &s;ure of his con|que&s;t, he never by word or look di&s;co|ver'd, till the marriage was fix'd on, that he was con&s;cious of the &s;ecret joy &s;he received by the alliance.</P>
<P>In about &s;ix weeks time they were publickly married; and Mr. Jennings, on his wedding day, &s;ettled her fortune, which was a thou&s;and pounds, on her younger &s;i&s;ter, and a jointure of eight hundred a year on his bride: time, and Mrs. Jennings's prudent behaviour, re|moved all thoughts of Mi&s;s Evelyn from her hu&s;band's mind, and they lived the mo&s;t perfect examples of conjugal af|fection that ever enter'd into the holy bands of wedlock.</P>
<P><PB N="56" REF="66">The news of this match was &s;ent to young Dumont as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible, and was received with a general joy in the family, hoping that the de&s;ign of it might have the de&s;ired effect, in preventing the lo&s;s of their much valued friend.</P>

<P>YOung Dumont had by this time fini&s;hed his &s;tudies, which, with all other nece&s;&s;ary accompli&s;hments, com|pleated him a perfect fine gentleman; but not that &s;ort of fine gentlemen which Mr. Woodward &s;o inimitably repre&s;ents in Mr. Garrick's celebrated dramatick per|formance call'd Lethe, or Ae&s;op in the &s;hades; for which the town are much obliged to the author, and the player, for having largely contributed to their entertainment &s;o many &s;ucce&s;&s;ive years, and which has rather encreas'd, than

<P>But to return to Dumont, his grand|papa began to con&s;ider him now in a different light; as he, tho' not pa&s;t his minority, di&s;covered the Man in every thought and action: and that he might be better able to judge of his di&s;po|&s;ition, entirely took off that re&s;traint which lay upon him, during the time of his education. The fir&s;t &s;tep he took towards making him ma&s;ter of him|&s;elf, was allowing him a thou&s;and pounds a year; and by the management of that, he could the ea&s;ier di&s;cern what might be expected from him, when po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of many thou&s;ands more.</P>
<P>Nor were his hopes and expectations un|an&s;wer'd; for tho' he &s;uddenly launched into all the plea&s;ures of life without controulment, he u&s;ed them but as inno|cent amu&s;ements, without becoming their SLAVE; and in every circum&s;tance kept up that noble character, which the example of his grandfire had &s;et before him.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t grand publick appearance he made was at Tunbridge, accompanied

<P>The magnificent appearance they made, attracted every eye, and excited the curio&s;ity of all the company there; they being &s;trangers to all but Lord Worthland, and Sir John Generous, who joined their party.

mi&s;take in the direction, and that the letter mu&s;t be de&s;igned for Mi&s;s Evelyn, to whom he directly carried it; apologi|zing for his having opened it; which er|ror, he told her, &s;he mu&s;t attribute to the per&s;on, who had certainly made a mi&s;take in the &s;uper&s;cription, was the rea&s;on of its being delivered to him.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Evelyn read the amorous epi&s;|tle, laughing inwardly to a violent de|gree during the peru&s;al; then returning the paper, Mr. Dumont, &s;aid &s;he, I don't &s;uppo&s;e the per&s;on who wrote it, would ca&s;t his eyes upon an odious Female; and I am po&s;itive the letter was meant as directed.</P>
<P>Dear Madam, replied Dumont, 'tis impo&s;&s;ible; 'tis true I have heard there are a &s;et of unnatural wretches, who are &s;hamefully addicted to a vice, not proper to be mentioned to &s;o deli|cate an ear as yours; but my behaviour could not in any degree give the &s;mal|le&s;t hope to the unnatural pa&s;&s;ion of &s;uch a dete&s;table brute. I therefore think it highly incumbent on me, to make an example of the villain.</P>
<P><PB N="61" REF="71">Mi&s;s Evelyn would fain have di&s;|&s;uaded him from his purpo&s;e, but in vain; for young Dumont was apprehen|&s;ive, that the bare mention of his name from the mouth of &s;uch a wretch, might throw an imputation on his character, which he had rather &s;uffer death than de&s;erve.</P>
<P>Mrs Evelyn was of the young gentle|man's mind, and urged him to put his revenge in immediate execution; advi|&s;ing him. to con&s;ult with Lord Worth|land and Sir John Generous, and entreat them to be witne&s;&s;es; as an affair of that nature mu&s;t be nece&s;&s;ary to pre|vent any calumny the mon&s;ter might po&s;&s;ibly rai&s;e on account of the de&s;erved treatment and di&s;appointment he &s;hould meet from Mr. Dumont. And in order to perpetrate the de&s;ign, advi&s;ed him to &s;end only a verbal an&s;wer, to let the crea|ture know he would attend his &s;um|mons; and in the mean time, &s;end or go to Sir John Generous, and com|municate the affair to him.</P>
<P>Mr. Dumont's valet brought his ma|&s;ter word, that the &s;ervant who came with the letter, de&s;ired an immediate
<PB N="62" REF="72">
an&s;wer. The valet having a kind of re&s;trained laugh on his face, his ma&s;ter a&s;ked him the occa&s;ion? I beg your ho|nour's pardon, &s;ays he, but the &s;ight of the per&s;on who waits the an&s;wer, put me into &s;uch a fit of laughing, I had &s;carce power to compo&s;e my&s;elf &s;uffici|ently, to bring the me&s;&s;age to you Sir. I really take it to be a young wench in boy's cloaths, by the &s;oftne&s;s of the voice, and the effeminacy of his behaviour. For heaven's &s;ake, &s;ays Mi&s;s Evelyn, let the creature come up, 'twill divert us.</P>
<P>Mr. Dumont's &s;ervant went down, and brought up the moppit; who&s;e hair was curl'd in the form of a fine lady's, and &s;cented the room with per|fumes, it &s;et their heads aching from the violent &s;trength of it; his dre&s;s was a fine milk-white &s;u&s;tian-frock, with green &s;attin cape and facings, a white cambrick handkerchief carele&s;sly tied round his neck, and a pair of white gloves; one of which he pulled off, and di&s;covered a beautiful white hand, with a hand&s;ome diamond ring on the little finger.</P>
<P><PB N="63" REF="73">Upon Mr. Dumont's enquiry into what po&s;t he held under Mr. Loveman, he an&s;wered, Dear &s;ir, I'm a young decay'd geman, but think my&s;elf happy now &s;ince the lo&s;s of my for|tin, to be vale de chamber to my deer ma&s;ter &s;quire Loveman; and a deer in|dulgint &s;oul he is, for if my fingur do but ake, he's like a crazy cretor; t'other day one of the footmen trod up|pon my toe, and bru$s'd me in a mo&s;t bar|brus manner, I believe indeed the willing owed me a &s;pight, and my ma&s;ter turn'd him of at a minits varning, and &s;ent for two of the mo&s;t aminent &s;urgins in townd, to in&s;ult about the cure. And indeed a great cure it vas, for every body thought I &s;hould have lo&s;t my toe-nail, it looked &s;o black under it&mdash; then lifting up his eyes, thanked pro|vidence, and the care of the &s;urgins the nail was pre&s;erved, and he was per|fectly recovered of the unhippy icci|dent.</P>
<P>That's a happine&s;s indeed, &s;aid Mi&s;s Evelyn, who knows the con&s;equence of your lo&s;ing your toe-nail! you might not for ought I know, have been able
<PB N="64" REF="74">
to have run of an errand the&s;e &s;ix months. Very true, dear lady, an&s;wered Mr. Turtle, (for that was the &s;oft creature's name) but if that had been the ca&s;e, 'twould have been in all the news|papers. But vorthy Sir, I believe by this time, my ma&s;ter expects me to dre&s;s him, plea&s;e to give me your ho|nour's orders. My compliments, &s;ays Mr. Dumont, and I &s;hall wait on on him at the time and place ap|pointed.</P>
<P>The pretty creature had not been gone above a quarter of an hour, be|fore Lord Worthland and Sir John Generous came to pay a vi&s;it; who were immediately informed of the af|fair, and re&s;olved to join with Mr. Dumont in his revenge on the un|natural &s;coundrel, for daring to make &s;uch an attempt upon a very honourable and worthy young gen|tleman.</P>
<P>About the hour of five after dinner, they went to the fi&s;h-ponds, which was the place propo&s;ed. Lord Worth|land and Sir John went in a little be|fore, and called for a bottle of cham|paign
<PB N="65" REF="75">
by them&s;elves in a different room.</P>
<P>Mr. Dumont came in a few minutes after, and was conducted by Mr. Love|man's footman, up one pair of &s;tairs, to the enamoured &s;wain, who had been waiting impatiently for his arrival above an hour.</P>
<P>When he came in he &s;aw an ele|gant cold collation &s;et forth, the win|dow curtains clo&s;e drawn and pinn'd; but found no body in the room; when a&s;king for the gentleman, the &s;ervant &s;neered, and told him, his Lady would wait upon him directly; when immediately there appeared from the inner-chamber, this odious creature in a female rich di&s;habille; who running to Mr. Dumont, cried out,
<Q>&startq;I come, I fly, to my adored Ca&s;talio's arms! my &endq;wi&s;hes lord!</Q>
&mdash; &s;topping here, with a langui&s;hing air, &s;aid, Do my angel, call me your Monimia! then with a bea&s;tly tran&s;port, ki&s;&s;ed him with that ardour, which might be expected from a drunk|en fellow to a common pro&s;titute. Mr. Dumont being now fully convinced of his horrid de&s;ign, without farther
<PB N="66" REF="76">
ceremony knocked him down, and di&s;|ciplined him with his cane; till the mon&s;ter was almo&s;t immoveable.</P>
<P>The noi&s;e of his falling brought up Lord Worthland, Sir John, and the landlord, who were &s;urprized to &s;ee Mr. Loveman's odd transformation; but he recollected his footman carried up a large bundle, little conceiving what it contained, or to what end it was brought.</P>
<P>Lord Worthland and Sir John would have be&s;towed their favours on him; but Mr. Dumont de&s;ired they would not rob him of the lea&s;t part of his revenge, nor indeed was there any need; for Du|mont who never &s;uffered pa&s;&s;ion, with|out ju&s;t grounds to influence his mind, thought he had &s;o ju&s;tifiable an excu&s;e for it on this occa&s;ion, he gave it full &s;cope, and left the wretch ju&s;t life e|nough to confe&s;s his crime, and publick|ly beg pardon.</P>
<P>The hi&s;tory of this affair in a few mi|nutes got wind, &s;ufficient to blow a whole mob together. And when the male-madam was permitted to decamp as he was, leading between two to
<PB N="67" REF="77">
his chariot, they &s;natched him from his &s;upporters, and very hand&s;omely ducked him in the fi&s;h-pond; nor had he a friend on his &s;ide, for even his own coachman and footman, tho' they were not a&s;&s;i&s;tant in his puni&s;hment, were heartily glad to &s;ee him under|go it. Mr. Dumont having had &s;uffi|cient revenge, his anger began to &s;ub&s;ide, and as the wretch wore a human form, (tho' in principle below a bea&s;t) his pity and good nature re&s;umed their throne, and by dint of a handful of &s;ilver thrown to the populace, they &s;uffered the &s;hame|ful object of their contempt to be hur|ried as fa&s;t as po&s;&s;ible to his lodgings, where the news had got before him; and as a farther addition to his misfotune, poor Mr. Turtle, who was &s;ent with the letter, (not knowing the contents of it,) as injured wives are apt to &s;hew vio|lent re&s;entment, when they find their hu&s;|bands are engaged in intrigues, flew a|bout the hou&s;e, raving like a di&s;tracted thing, menacing bittere&s;t revenge on him and his filty creter; adding, cor&s;e me, if I forgive this willingy; this is the &s;econd time you have wronged me;
<PB N="68" REF="78">
if I bear it a third, the fault &s;hall be mine; I de&s;ire we may &s;aprate, ungrate|ful man; I have ever been true to you, and this is my reward.</P>
<P>Mr. Loveman, who was in too mi&s;era|ble a condition to expo&s;tulate with his offended fair; begged madam for that time to &s;et a&s;ide its anger, and give what a&s;&s;i&s;tance he cou'd towards his relief. Surgeons were &s;ent for, un|der who&s;e hands he remained for a|bove a month, before he could be mo|ved. At the expiration of which time, he was forced to go privately away from Tunbridge, for fear of a &s;econd en|counter; and the fracea between him and his lady was made up, (as one of the fervants informed us, who over|heard their di&s;cour&s;e) with a faithful pro|mi&s;e to retire from the world, and live <HI>&s;hepherde&s;&s;es together in &s;ome remote country</HI>.</P>
<P>Mr. Dumont &s;atisfied the poor land|lord, for the preparations made for him by the love-&s;ick &s;quire, and &s;ome da|mages done in the fray. Then the three friends returned home, and gave the hi&s;tory of their adventure to Mi&s;s
<PB N="69" REF="79" MS="Y">
Evelyn and her mama. Mrs. Evelyn tho' &s;he allowed the ju&s;tice of the thing, could not help pittying the unhappy creature; but Mi&s;s &s;aid, &s;he could not entertain the lea&s;t grain of compa&s;&s;ion, for that in her opinion, no puni&s;hment was &s;ufficiently &s;evere for &s;uch unna|tural mon&s;ters.</P>
<P>When they had fini&s;hed their narra|tion, the ladies propo&s;ed taking a turn in the Queen's Grove, which was readily accepted by all, particularly Sir John Generous; who was pa&s;&s;ionately, but at that time &s;ecretly in love with Mi&s;s Evelyn; nor was Lord Worthland totally free from the power of her beauty, but his being a married man, and con&s;cious that Mi&s;s Evelyn's virtue was invincible, prudently declined any opportunity of encouraging a pa&s;&s;ion he knew would only be a motive of grief, without the lea&s;t hope of redre&s;s; &s;o took his leave and went to the hazard table.</P>
<P>On their return they pa&s;s'd the re&s;t of the evening till &s;upper time at cards; Mr. Dumont took notice Sir John did not mind one tittle of his game, but kept his eyes fix'd on his lovely partner,
<PB N="70" REF="80" MS="Y">
who, from his remi&s;&s;ne&s;s in play, wa$ drawn in to lo&s;e &s;everal guineas; at la&s;t growing impatient at his carele&s;&s;ne&s;s and her ill &s;ucce&s;s, &s;he changed him for Mr. Dumont, and Sir John was turned over to Mrs. Evelyn, who partook of her daughter's ill fortune equally; at la&s;t &s;aid Dumont, I believe the only way to make Sir John mind his cards, will be to &s;t$ke Mi&s;s Evelyn. Upon which Sir John blu&s;h'd and trembled, and beg'd to give off playing; accordingly they did, and for about an hour Mr. Dumont and Mi&s;s Evelyn entertain'd the Baronet and her Mama with mu&s;ick and &s;inging; Mr. Dumont accompained Mi&s;s's hea|venly voice on the harp&s;ichord; the reader may be &s;ure the melody of her pipe, with her &s;kill conjoin'd, were not a little fatal to the lover's ear. Every charm this lady was po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of, threw in their darts by thou&s;ands, yet notwith|&s;tanding the violence of his pa&s;&s;ion, there was &s;uch a commanding awe in her countenance, he dur&s;t not give the lea&s;t hint of the conque&s;t &s;he had made, but re&s;olved within him&s;elf, to impart his di&s;tre&s;s to his friend Dumont, which he
<PB N="71" REF="81">
did, by &s;ending him a card next morning to meet him at the Glo'&s;ter tavern, then took his leave; how he re&s;ted I leave to the imagination of all contemplative lo|vers, and as night is far &s;pent, &s;hall, in compa&s;&s;ion to my readers, leave them to their repo&s;e.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VII. Mr. <HI>Dumont</HI> meets Sir <HI>John</HI>. Their Di&s;cour&s;e. Three &s;trange Figures make an unexpected Appearance at the Ball at Night. A De&s;cription of them.</HEAD>
<P>THE next morning Mr. Dumont ha&s;tened to Sir John upon re|ceiving the card, and found him repeating ver&s;es to him&s;elf, which were encomiums adapted to the fair idol of his &s;oul; he was &s;o lo&s;t in his rhap&s;odies that Mr. Dumont, who &s;tood &s;miling at him, had been in the room near five minutes be|fore he perceived him; at la&s;t &s;pying him out, beg'd ten thou&s;and pardons; but,
<PB N="72" REF="82">
&s;aid he, you mu&s;t forgive the fond rap|tures of a di&s;tracted lover, for, upon my &s;oul, dear Dumont, that's my ca&s;e. You might have &s;pared that information, reply'd the other; your behaviour at cards la&s;t night was a &s;ufficient te&s;ti|monial of your having lo&s;t your &s;en&s;es. I hope you don't mean that as a rough compliment to the lady, &s;aid the baronet, for no man can be in his wits, or indeed have any &s;en&s;e at all, that is incapable of feeling the efficacy of &s;uch a fund of beauty, under&s;tanding, and &s;weetne&s;s of di&s;po&s;ition. But perhaps, continued he, I am talking to a rival all this while. I a&s;&s;ure you no, &s;aid Dumont, my regard to Mi&s;s Evelyn is founded entirely upon a fraternal friend&s;hip, and that with the utmo&s;t tenderne&s;s for her per&s;on, and due regard to her honour. I would not hear of an injury offered to either, nay, but barely intended, without revenging it with my &s;word, tho' my life were to prove the forfeit for my integrity. I look on her as on a very beautiful picture, which all mu&s;t be allow'd to admire; and in conver&s;ing with her, I think of her under&s;tanding as of a well-wrote volume,
<PB N="73" REF="83">
where, the more I read, I continually find out new beauties, and con&s;equently never tire in the peru&s;al. Is it po&s;&s;ible, an&s;wered Sir John, you can have &s;uch elevated thoughts, and yet keep your heart &s;ecure? but perhaps you are engaged el&s;ewhere. Indeed, Sir, replied Dumont, I don't know that ever I was &s;eriou&s;ly in love in my life, though I promi&s;e you, I have a heart &s;u&s;ceptible of it, from &s;ome tender attacks in a few trifling gallantries with the fair &s;ex; but I have not yet met with the woman that is to make me her entire &s;lave; when I do, I don't doubt but I &s;hall appear as ri|diculous a figure as you do now; did you but &s;ee how harmle&s;s you look, you would laugh at your own &s;hadow; but come to the purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>I &s;uppo&s;e the de&s;ign of this interview is to engage me in your intere&s;t with Mi&s;s Evelyn, and from your want of a&s;&s;urance, I mu&s;t break the matter to her, is it not &s;o? Truly gue&s;s'd, &s;aid Sir John, if four thou&s;and a year clear e&s;tate can make her amends for the incum|brance of &s;uch an odd fellow as I am; I'm ready to throw both at her feet to
<PB N="74" REF="84" MS="Y">
morrow morning; and, between you and I, all raillery apart, my dear friend, &s;he or death mu&s;t be my portion. I have loved her to di&s;traction near a twelve-month, and find my&s;elf unable any longer to bear the torment of un|certainty; therefore depend on your friend&s;hip to urge my &s;uit with the mo&s;t per&s;ua&s;ive eloquence, which no one is more happily po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of than your&s;elf.</P>
<P>Dumont faithfully promis'd him all the a&s;&s;i&s;tance in his power, advi&s;ing him to wait patiently till their return from Tunbridge, in re&s;pect to the Count, who had adopted her as his own child; and however Mi&s;s might be inclined to his propo&s;al, he was certain without his Lord|&s;hip's approbation, it would be in vain to hope for &s;ucce&s;s; and farther urged, that he thought it a compliment due to his Grand-papa, to be fir&s;t acquainted with it, nor upon any other conditions would he undertake his cau&s;e. The impatient lover thought it hard, but rather than run the hazard of not obtaining his wi&s;h|es, acceded to the treaty, well knowing that all punctillio's of honour and re&s;pect to the Count, were &s;trictly kept up by
<PB N="75" REF="85" MS="Y">
the whole family; and as he had the &s;atisfaction of con&s;tantly vi&s;iting there, it greatly le&s;&s;en'd the pain he mu&s;t have otherwi&s;e endured from the protraction of his happine&s;s.</P>
<P>It growing near the u&s;ual time of dre&s;&s;ing, the gentlemen parted, but Sir John &s;oon ran through that ceremony, and in about an hour's time was at Mr. Dumont's lodgings; by way of a&s;king the Ladies if they went to the ball that night, which was given by a young Nobleman who was ju&s;t come of age, and to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a very great e&s;tate.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Evelyn told him they &s;hould all be there, for that his Lord&s;hip had ju&s;t &s;ent tickets before he come in; he then beg'd the favour of her hand as a part|ner in dancing, which &s;he readily con|&s;ented to, to the no &s;mall tran&s;port of the de&s;iring lover.</P>
<P>In the evening they all went together, where there was a mo&s;t &s;plendid appear|ance of people of the fir&s;t quality and di|&s;tinction; but to the great &s;urprize of this polite a&s;&s;embly, there &s;uddenly appear'd three of the mo&s;t droll and really gro|te&s;que figures that was ever repre&s;ented
<PB N="76" REF="86">
by way of burle&s;que upon either of the Engli&s;h Theatres, Sir Boi&s;trous Blunder, with his &s;on and daughter. Sir Boi|&s;trous was one of tho&s;e true hearted En|gli&s;h gentlemen, who gave the &s;tronge&s;t proof of the regard he paid to tho&s;e glori|ous &s;taples of his country, <HI>viz.</HI> a good fat ox, and the be&s;t brew'd malt, not for|getting that nece&s;&s;ary ingredient towards the compo&s;ition of a well-fed country &s;quire, call'd a pudding; the &s;on's wai&s;t was within a few inches arrived to the glori|ous circumference of the Sire, and &s;eem'd, by his bulk, to have been no le&s;s indu&s;|trious in that happy acqui&s;ition; nor did Mi&s;s fall &s;hort of either for &s;ize and &s;tature; her full blown ro&s;y cheeks, and &s;turdy &s;tructure, fully demon&s;trated, that like
<Q>&startq;Cato's daughter, &s;he inherited all &endq;her Father's virtues.</Q></P>
<P>They were no &s;ooner enter'd, than the eyes of the whole a&s;&s;embly were employ'd in an exact &s;urvey of them; nor could the antidiluvian figures they made, fail of fixing every beholder into an ab&s;olute a&s;toni&s;hment; their cloaths were of the fa&s;hion of the la&s;t century, the young Lady had a garden &s;attin gown and coat, which, undoubtedly, had been tran&s;|mitted
<PB N="77" REF="87" MS="Y">
to po&s;terity for at lea&s;t &s;ix gene|rations, with a hoop about the &s;ize of a milk pail, and a four-lappet head with a broad point lace, &s;o loaded with &s;tarch that a thump from one of the lappets might fairly have knocked down a por|ter; and &s;uch an inundation of broad ro&s;e-colour'd ribbands, a milliner might have &s;ub&s;i&s;ted a quarter of a year from the profits of them; which, with the addition of a red neck and face, &s;he appear'd like a moving fire.</P>
<P>The &s;on was as elegant in his dre&s;s, which con&s;i&s;ted of a yellowi&s;h looking camblet, with a narrow boot &s;leeve that was turn'd up very near his &s;houlder, adorn'd with a mighty narrow binding of half lace that looked like tape of a farthing a yard; his coat &s;hort wai&s;ted, and the &s;kirts reaching at lea&s;t three parts downwards on his legs; his long lank &s;orrel hair, to &s;how a di&s;tingui&s;hing ta&s;te, was tied back with a black ferret, about the length of an untam'd colt's tail; and the lovely bundle over his forehead, and each &s;ide his face, was a frequent impedi|ment to his eyes and mouth; and the &s;udorifick quality of his head render'd
<PB N="78" REF="88" MS="Y">
the u&s;e of pomatum entirely needle&s;s. In &s;hort, who&s;oever has had the plea&s;ure of &s;eeing Mr. Co&s;tollo's inimitable and droll performance of the character of 'Squire Timothy Gazette, in Mr. Foote's comedy of two acts, entitled the Knights, may have a true picture of him in that actor's lively repre&s;entation; whom, to do him a real piece of ju&s;tice, I don't know any of his cotemporaries can equal in that part; and what con&s;iderably adds to the &s;atisfaction he gives the Audience, he has &s;en&s;e enough to play the fool <HI>without laughing at his own jokes</HI>, but wi&s;ely leaves that for the &s;pectators to do; an error which, tho' he prudently avoids, mo&s;t of our comedy actors are apt to run into, by which means they very ju&s;tly acquire the character of buffoons.</P>
<P>I hope the unexperienced part of the &s;tage, will (as Mr. Vellum &s;ays) pardon me for being jocular, but it is really true; and hope, for their own &s;akes, they will have wit enough to take my hint, and follow Mr. Co&s;tollo's Example.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t a &s;econd time beg pardon for digre&s;&s;ing from my &s;ubject, but as it bore &s;ome &s;ort of connexion, hope to be for|given,
<PB N="79" REF="89" MS="Y">
and &s;hall now return to my &s;tory.</P>
<P>The old gentleman was as great a cu|rio&s;ity as his worthy offsprings; his appearance be&s;poke him a very old fa&s;hion'd country grazier; his extream broad face and fat jowls, gave the com|pany a perfect and lively idea of a Sara|cen's head; his bulk and &s;tature very little inferior to the giants in Guild-hall; his behaviour was concomitant with the de&s;cription given of his per&s;on. As for example, through the exce&s;&s;ive heat of the weather, and the multitude in the a&s;&s;embly, the knight very politely threw off his wig, turning the caul in&s;ide out to dry, and &s;lap'd it down by a well-dre&s;s'd young lady, who was obliged, from the &s;ickly &s;cent, to have recour&s;e to the other end of the room; then, after rubbing him&s;elf down like a cart hor&s;e, cover'd his reeking bald pate with a large &s;ilk handkerchief, &s;tripping his cloaths open with both hands, &s;hook his &s;udo|rifick &s;hirt, which had not a dry thread in it, till he had poi&s;on'd all the company, not only with the odious &s;mell, but the bea&s;tly &s;ight of his dirty colour'd hairy bo&s;om, that bore a &s;trong re&s;emblance
<PB N="80" REF="90" MS="Y">
of a leafle&s;s hedge in winter. Mi&s;s to mend the matter, undergoing the &s;ame inconveniencies of heat, began to rub Her&s;elf down as her well-bred papa had done ju&s;t before; and turning to a man of Quality, bawls out lauk, lauk, mea&s;ter, do but feel how I &s;wot. Upon this a general laugh &s;ucceeded, which Mi&s;s conceiving aro&s;e from her having &s;aid a comical thing, join'd very heartily in, as did the father, who was proud of his daughter's vivacity, thunders out his ri&s;ible applau&s;e, a&s;&s;uring the nobleman, that Ur&s;ula was a &s;tout wench, and if he would but talk to her he'd find her a match for him. I don't know but &s;he might, an&s;wer'd the young Lord, but I believe I &s;han't in a hurry be a match for her.</P>
<P>The young &s;quire began to expre&s;s his unea&s;ine&s;s to his father, at being &s;o long ab&s;ent from Ringwood and Jowler, de&s;iring 'em to go home; no, no, &s;ays the knight, let's &s;ee a little more jigging fir&s;t; pox on't, &s;ays the &s;on, I'm tired on't; drawing out a &s;hort empty bench, &s;tretch'd him&s;elf out like a corp&s;e, and in le&s;s than two minutes, fell into a mo&s;t pro|found
<PB N="81" REF="91" MS="Y">
fit of &s;noring; in which he con|tinued &s;ome time. The company re|que&s;ting a minuet and louvre from Mr. Dumont and Mi&s;s Evelyn; the old man was charmed with their uncommon and attractive air, as his brother bea&s;ts were by the &s;weetne&s;s of Orpheus' pipe, and jumbling his heir apparent forced him to wake to ob&s;erve them. With much difficulty the youth awoke; when he had &s;ufficiently yawn'd, and &s;tretch'd forth his arms and legs, to the infi|nite hazard of tho&s;e who &s;tood near him; he told his father, it might be very fine for ought he knew; but he had rather &s;ee his favourites Ringwood and Jowler in full career after a &s;tags. Hold your tongue, you fool, &s;ays the father, I under&s;tand they are rich folks, and if I can, I'll make up a match with 'em for you and Ur&s;ula; when Madam has done dancing, do you go and have a little jaw with her; you dog you can be comical enough when you have a mind to't; dang me, if I do, &s;aid the &s;quire, (&s;cratching his head) I don't under|&s;tand half their lingo; they have got &s;uch a pack of cramp words, the devil

him&s;elf don't know what to make of them. Pho! you blockhead, replied the knight, I'll talk to 'em my&s;elf, I warrant you I can find out their meaning, tho' your nump&s;cull can't.</P>
<P>When the dance was over, Sir Boi|&s;trous tying his handkerchief under his chin, with his hat in one hand, and his grea&s;y wig dangling in the other, marches boldly up to Mr. Dumont and his company; acco&s;ting him in the man|ner following:</P>
<P>Well done young folks, e'god you two be the feete&s;t of the &s;et, I minded that; then turning to Sir John Gene|rous, gave Him &s;ome degree of approba|tion; but a&s;&s;ured Him, he was nothing to compare to the young man in the broi|dered coat; but I like you all, an if &s;o be you come and foul a plate with me to-morrow, if you have got nothing bet|ter to do, you &s;hall be wellcome; for I have got &s;omething to &s;ay to you.</P>
<P>For heaven's &s;ake, &s;aid Sir John, in a whi&s;per to Dumont, accept the invita|tion; I would not for fifty guineas lo&s;e this &s;port. Mr. Dumont in compliance

to his friend's reque&s;t, promi&s;ed to wait on him.</P>
<P>The knight perceiving there were four of them, de&s;ired 'em all to come. I &s;ee you are all of one knot, and one &s;hall be wellcome as t'other; cried the hearty old man. Then calling to his daughter, with a hip ya ho, our Ur&s;ula! Mi&s;s came &s;tumping cro&s;s the room, with the air and gentility of a plowman, and curty&s;ing upon one leg to the com|pany; turned to her father, to know what he kept &s;uch a hooping for? Why lookee, d'ye &s;ee, &s;aid he, I have a&s;ked the&s;e gentlefolks to dinner to|morrow; now do take care, d'ye &s;ee and get &s;omething clever; now take notice, d'ye &s;ee, here's four of Them, and three of us, that makes &s;even; let there be plenty, that every one may have enough; full bellies, and empty platters, &s;ay I, Heh, young lady! ap|plying to Mi&s;s Evelyn, as to good liquor, that &s;hall be my care, and a hearty wellcome you may depend on; &s;o pray don't baulk me now, but be &s;ure to come; they faithfully promi&s;ed, and kept their words.</P>
<P><PB N="84" REF="94">The knight recollecting, that tea was a general u&s;e with the ladies in an after|noon, &s;trictly charged his daughter, to get an ounce of each &s;ort of the be&s;t; and a pound of the fine&s;t &s;ugar; that's an article, you mu&s;t know ladies, we're &s;eldom provided with; for my part, I don't know the ta&s;te on't. And for Ur&s;ula and her brother, they ge|nerally make a hearty meal with me, of what's left of the cold meat the day before, and a tankard of &s;tingo; but I have a good three thou&s;and a year, for all that; and lookee, d'ye &s;ee, adod I love to keep up the cu&s;tom of good Queen Be&s;&s;es days, when the maids of honour could make a hearty meal out of a rump of beef for breakfa&s;t; and I warrant they looked as fat and as fair as your fine ladies of the pre&s;ent age. A woman now that is bigger than a &s;ixpenny doll, is looked upon as a mon|&s;ter; but lookee, had that ancient cu&s;|tom been kept up, &s;o many good e&s;|tates would not have wanted heirs to 'em. A boy of ten years of age in tho&s;e days, was &s;touter than a man of five and twenty now; why there's my daughter,
<PB N="85" REF="95" MS="Y">
&s;hall wre&s;tle or box with e'er a two men within fifty miles of her, for a wager of as many pounds.</P>
<P>Sir John Generous, who was expiring with laughing inwardly, could not help allowing, that Mi&s;s gave very promi&s;ing hopes of a happy capacity for &s;o lively and nece&s;&s;ary a qualification in a young lady: acknowledging, that he &s;hould, tho' a well &s;et and full grown young gentleman, be fearful to encounter her in a boxing match. I own Mi&s;s is finely turn'd for that exerci&s;e; nor do I believe &s;he can po&s;&s;ibly be matched by any of her &s;i&s;ter-females thro' the three kingdoms.</P>
<P>Sir Boi&s;trous, who&s;e &s;tupidity took this &s;peech of Sir John's for a mark of approbation; an&s;wered, no truly I be|lieve not; you &s;ee what a &s;tout fellow her brother is, icod &s;he trip'd up his heels the other day, he could have no &s;hare with her, a rare girl, a rare girl, I faith.</P>
<P>The old gentleman having &s;ufficiently de&s;canted on the young lady's &s;trength and agility, thought it time to take leave for that night; repeating, from the far|ther end of the room, till he had reached
<PB N="86" REF="96">
the door, his injunctions on the compa|ny not to fail of their appointment; then &s;tuffed him&s;elf and un&s;izeable daughter into their jingling cha|riot, which &s;ounded like a &s;et of pri|&s;oners in chains, from the rattling it made when going along.</P>
<P>The young &s;quire to give proof of his exalted notions of life, mounted the box; ordering the coachman to get up behind with the footman; but the poor &s;quire, having more alacrity than judgment in driving, &s;uddenly whipping up the ambling and trotting bea&s;ts, took too &s;hort a turn, and unfortu|nately over&s;et the vehicle; upon which Mi&s;s roar'd out, odd roty what a plague bu&s;ine&s;s had you to pretend to drive, what does father keep Jonas for? Pox on your fine airs, you have broke every bone in my &s;kin.</P>
<P>The corpulent knight, who &s;uffered a few brui&s;es, was equally enrag'd; and having crawled out of the leathern conveniency, &s;at down at an ale-hou&s;e door, to &s;ave charges; while Mi&s;s, who had received no other hurt than the &s;urprize, was greatly in&s;trumental in help|ing

up the chariot; which when &s;he had accompli&s;hed, Sir Boi&s;terous and &s;he got in, and Jonas was rein&s;tated; who with a creeping care, conducted them home in about an hour's time to their lodgings, which was not much a|bove half a mile from the ball room.</P>
<P>The &s;quire walked by the &s;ide of them, deeply engaged in a &s;colding match with his &s;i&s;ter; which la&s;ted till they parted to go to bed.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VIII. A De&s;cription of their Entertainment. Sir <HI>Boi&s;trous</HI> not a little ab&s;urd at the Arrival of his Gue&s;ts. The Squire meets with a Di&s;a&s;ter. A drawn Battle between him and Mi&s;s. Mr. <HI>Dumont</HI> receives a Letter from Mr. <HI>Evelyn,</HI> by which a Di&s;covery is made.</HEAD>
<P>NEXT morning Mi&s;s and her maid Cicely ro&s;e before their u&s;ual hour, to prepare for the expected gue&s;ts; Jo|nas, and Jonathan, were equally employ|ed in their &s;pheres; after they had been bu&s;ied about a couple of hours, down comes the young &s;quire; on the &s;ight of whom, Mi&s;s rea&s;&s;umed her di&s;cour&s;e, beginning where &s;he left off the night before. After they had talked them|&s;elves into an ab&s;olute fighting-match, the &s;quire with his darling companions, the hounds, &s;et out; leaving Mi&s;s in the height of her pa&s;&s;ion, which
<PB N="89" REF="99" MS="Y">
frequently vented upon poor Cicely, ha|ving lo&s;t the real object of it for that morning.</P>
<P>About half an hour after one, the company came. Upon hearing the coach &s;top, Sir Boi&s;trous hobbled up to the gate, in order to conduct them in; but his fancy was &s;o taken with the grand appearance of Mr. Dumont's equipage, he entirely forgot to do the civilities of his hou&s;e, and left them to introduce them&s;elves.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t he &s;taid to admire the beau|tiful painting of Mr. Dumont's coach, and the extraordinary make of the &s;ix white Flanders mares that drew it: he told the coachman, he was afraid his ma&s;ter was an extravagant young gentleman, in be&s;towing &s;o much rich lace upon their liveries; which, in his opinion was &s;ufficient to dre&s;s out the &s;uperior officers of a whole regiment. But upon hearing that Mr. Dumont's fortune was an&s;werable to all that &s;plendor, he was not a little pleas'd. And beginning to recollect that he had been guilty of an error, went puffing
<PB N="90" REF="100">
and blowing after the company; where he ran into a &s;econd ab&s;urdity, by keep|ing 'em all &s;tanding near ten minutes, whil&s;t he was awkwardly apologizing for the commi&s;&s;ion of the former. At la&s;t Sir John and Mr. Dumont made bold each to reach a chair for Mi&s;s Evelyn and her mama, which put the Knight in mind of his inadvertency in omitting that piece of good-manners; which he excu&s;ed by bidding 'em not mind him, but make them&s;elves as free as if they were at home: that for his part he never &s;tood upon ceremonies, and hoped they would forgive him, for not being as <HI>pur|lite</HI> as they were; for in troth, &s;aid he, I never was bred to't, nor my father before me: I know I'm a home&s;pun old fellow, but, lookee d'ye &s;ee, you are all welcome, and that's as much as I can &s;ay.</P>
<P>His good-nature, notwith&s;tand|ing his ru&s;ticity, engaged 'em not to laugh at him: the old gentleman fix'd his eyes upon Mrs. Evelyn, who was really a very fine woman, and but a little more than forty; he imagined her to be a widow, and pre&s;ently at|tacked
<PB N="91" REF="101" MS="Y">
her with an offer of marriage, and not waiting her an&s;wer, propos'd an alliance for his &s;on and daughter with Mi&s;s Evelyn and Mr. Dumont, a&s;&s;uring them, that was the motive of his en|gaging 'em that day to dinner. How, how, Sir Boi&s;trous, &s;aid Sir John, wou'd you marry your &s;on to his &s;i&s;ter-in-law? Why not, &s;aid the Knight? our fore|fathers married their Own fle&s;h and blood, this is not &s;o near, or if it were, why may we not follow their examples? Be|cau&s;e, &s;aid Sir John, tho&s;e laws have been for ages aboli&s;hed, and they had a rea&s;on for it at the beginning of the world, in order to propagate their &s;pe|cies, and do honour to their Creator; but to cut off all fruitle&s;s expectation of an alliance with this lady, I mu&s;t inform you &s;he has a hu&s;band living, a gentle|man of great worth in regard to his per|&s;onal merits, and of &s;o refined an under|&s;tanding, that were &s;he to lo&s;e him, I am apt to think &s;he would never per|mit any other to &s;upply his place. You don't know, young gentleman, an&s;wered the Knight, I'cod if Madam were &s;ingle again I'd &s;trike up bri&s;kly to her, and
<PB N="92" REF="102">
who knows what we might do toge|ther?</P>
<P>Mrs. Evelyn de&s;ir'd the old gentle|man to drop the di&s;cour&s;e, as 'twas quite unplea&s;ing; a&s;&s;uring him, that a &s;uppo&s;ition of Mr. Evelyn's death, even in raillery, was a theme &s;he never &s;uf|fer'd in her hearing, much le&s;s to join in it. Well, well, Madam, &s;aid Sir Boi&s;terous, no harm done, I hope; and &s;ince we can't make a match, I hope you won't take it ami&s;s if I propo&s;e joining the young ones together. After dinner, Sir Boi&s;trous, an&s;wered Sir John. Be&s;ides, &s;aid he, you country gentlemen, I know, &s;eldom love to make bargains upon empty &s;tomachs, &s;o we'll e'en de|fer the propo&s;ition till the afternoon: Aye, aye, with all my heart, Sir, &s;ays the Knight; and &s;ee our mouths are &s;topp'd, for dinner is now coming cro&s;s the hall.</P>
<P>Jonathan led the van, with a buttock of beef of a mo&s;t enormous &s;ize, that the di&s;h appeared to walk in of it&s;elf, di&s;covering no part of the man but his legs, till he had &s;et it on the table. Jonas, who&s;e effluvia's of the &s;table were
<PB N="93" REF="103">
in&s;upportable, followed next, with a large di&s;h in each hand, laden with car|rots in the one, and cabbage in the other. Mrs. Cicely next made her appearance, with a roa&s;ted leg of veal; and Mi&s;s brought up the rear with a great ham of her own curing, which &s;erved her for a topick during their meal; which &s;eem'd rather calculated for the coming &s;tomachs of &s;o many plowmen at a harve&s;t-home, than for the entertainment of people of di&s;tinction and fa&s;hion.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s, with her accu&s;tomed elegance, de&s;ir'd every one to help them&s;elves, for in troth &s;he was &s;o whot &s;he cou'd not cut up the meyt, not &s;he; &s;o e'en help your &s;elves good folks, &s;ays &s;he, then all your friends will love you. Mr. Du|mont wou'd have helped Mi&s;s, but &s;he cho&s;e to &s;tay till they had all done, and &s;ignified to the company &s;he'd pick a bit by and by with Ci&s;s i'the kitchen. Then every now and then wiped her face with a grea&s;y napkin, bitterly complain|ing of her heat and fatigue; but then, &s;ays &s;he, it mu&s;t be &s;o if one would have things a little better than ordinary, for I fack there's no tru&s;ting to &s;ervants.</P>
<P><PB N="94" REF="104" MS="Y">After the removal of the fir&s;t cour&s;e, a prepo&s;terous hot butter'd apple-pye, and a thundering bak'd plumb pudding, attended by a huge Che&s;hire chee&s;e con|cluded the eatable part of the entertain|ment; and Jonathan &s;oon after intro|duced a boiling bowl which contained &s;ix quarts of rum punch, to clo&s;e this noble treat; the &s;cent of which, 'tis &s;uppo&s;ed, drew the young Squire home, who, with his two dogs, meet|ing the &s;ervant at the parlour door with the buttock of beef, had it again re|plac'd on the table, which di&s;order'd the whole oeconomy of it, and without &s;it|ting down, decently reach'd acro&s;s the ladies to cut a &s;lice of about four pounds weight, which he laid upon a mon&s;trous &s;lice of bread of the thickne&s;s of a large brick-bat; after having wa&s;h'd it down with near two quarts of &s;trong beer, he be|gan clapping his &s;ides, which &s;et Ring-wood and Jowler upon full cry; then ble&s;s'd his &s;tars that he &s;hould be able to hold out till &s;upper. And now, &s;aid he, puffing and blowing, I have time to a&s;k you how you all do? Then, by way of being extreme comical, told 'em he
<PB N="95" REF="105">
knew he &s;hould come in with 'em for all they &s;et out before him; 'twas not his cu&s;tom to &s;tay till the cour&s;e was over. I'cod I have a no&s;e as keen as a grey-hound, I knew I &s;hould come in by hedge or by ditch.</P>
<P>The Knight and Squire thundered out a barbarous loud laugh at the conclu&s;ion of this wittici&s;m, telling the company, that Joceline was the cute&s;t dog in all Devon&s;hire: Lord, to hear the witty things that rogue comes out with at club! There's Sir Arthur Addlepate, Mr. Francis Ful&s;ome, Sir Frederick Fatty, and Sir Simon Stupid, are never at re&s;t without him; they'll &s;it and &s;moak, and drink, and &s;ing for a week together, without ever &s;eeing their beds; and drive &s;uch a randy they make the whole pari&s;h ring again; I'cod, 'tis a chip of the old block; time was when I could have done as much, but 'tis over with me now.</P>
<P>The company were entertained 'till tea-time, with the noble exploits and merry conceits of Ma&s;ter Joceline; when they were happily reliev'd by Jonathan's bringing in the tea equipage, who&s;e
<PB N="96" REF="106">
careful countenance in the execution of that office, con&s;iderably added to the drollery of his figure: Mr. Jonathan wore his own black &s;hining hair, cut quite round his head and face, in the form and exactitude of a bowl-di&s;h; a full black eye, with a meagre face, which be&s;poke him to have been from his youth the &s;on of hard labour and in|du&s;try; when he had di&s;charged him&s;elf from this trouble&s;ome burden of care and china, which he had never been loaded with before, he quitted the room with the utmo&s;t expedition; and at the door met the landlady, who &s;tood trembling there with terrible apprehen|&s;ions of receiving back &s;ome &s;laughter'd cups; but Jonathan, who had counted his &s;teps from the time he took it in hand, ea&s;ed her of tho&s;e fears: But, <HI>alas! who can controul their fate!</HI> Mi&s;s Blunder was &s;o unhappy in the di&s;po|&s;ition of the cups and &s;aucers, that in planting, or rather plumping them one into the other, &s;he &s;oon demoli&s;hed four or five of 'em.</P>
<P>When Jonathan carried in the ma&s;&s;a|cred ware to the good woman of the
<PB N="97" REF="107">
hou&s;e, &s;he wrung her hands and wept bitterly for the misfortune, prote&s;ting that the &s;ett co&s;t her eight guineas, and were no where to be match'd.</P>
<P>The poor &s;oul brought in a fre&s;h par|cel, and without any regard to Mi&s;s Blunder, apply'd her&s;elf to Mi&s;s Evelyn, humbly intreating her to do the honours of the tea-table, as &s;he was well a&s;&s;ured from her appearance &s;he perfectly un|der&s;tood it. Mi&s;s Evelyn complied with her reque&s;t, in pity to the young lady, as well as in compa&s;&s;ion to the landlady, whom &s;he apprehended might po&s;&s;ibly meet with a &s;econd vexation, had Mi&s;s Blunder proceeded in the office; but Mi&s;s gladly re&s;igned it, and only undertook the attendance on the tea-kettle; but even in that &s;he was unfor|tunate, for as &s;he was ha&s;tily going to reach it her foot &s;lipp'd, and over&s;et that and the lamp, which unluckily fell on her brother's legs, and both burned and &s;calded him to a violent degree. This put the whole company in terrible con|fu&s;ion, and the Squire bellow'd &s;o loud the neighbours began to a&s;&s;emble about the door, being apprehen&s;ive murder

had been committed; but when they were told of the Occident, and by what means it happen'd, they di&s;per&s;ed them|&s;elves, laughing at the aukward young lady, who&s;e oddity they had been ac|quainted with before.</P>
<P>Mrs. Evelyn and her daughter kindly employed them&s;elves in admini&s;tring remedies to the poor Squire, who&s;e &s;uf|ferings were very great, as was his rage on the account. Mrs. Evelyn a&s;king for a bottle of oil, Mi&s;s brought it, and tho' the young gentleman had lo&s;t at that time the u&s;e of his legs, he had not that of his hands, but whipping up his cour&s;ing &s;taff that &s;tood at his elbow, he knock'd his &s;i&s;ter down flat on the floor, who ri&s;ing up was going to re|turn the blow, had not Sir John and Mr. Dumont interpo&s;ed; however, it was impo&s;&s;ible for 'em to &s;top their tongues, the obliging epithets of dog and bitch were to&s;&s;ed from one to t'other like a &s;huttlecock, and menaces of &s;evere&s;t revenge on poor Mi&s;s, as &s;oon as ever the Squire was able to crawl: don't tell me, &s;ays Mi&s;s, I am but even with you for trundling feyther
<PB N="99" REF="109" MS="Y">
and I out of the chariot: the Squire for|getting the re&s;pect and tenderne&s;s due to a parent, bawls out, Ah, damn you, I wi&s;h it had broke both your necks: the incen&s;ed Knight upon this came in for his &s;hare of the reckoning, and reward|ed the Squire with a barbarous blow with his oaken plant over his head, vowing he'd cut off the intail of the e&s;tate, and make Ur&s;y &s;ole heir; to which the youth replied, rot him, but he'd poi&s;on her if he did.</P>
<P>Mrs. Evelyn advis'd Sir Boi&s;trous to excu&s;e his &s;on's pa&s;&s;ion, as &s;he was &s;en|&s;ible he underwent an infinite deal of pain; and that to prevent a fever, which might very po&s;&s;ibly en&s;ue, he &s;hou'd be put to bed: this was accordingly done; and the company took leave, with an earne&s;t reque&s;t to Sir Boi&s;trous as &s;oon as Mr. Joce&s;line was able to come a|broad to have their vi&s;it returned, which he faithfully promi&s;ed, and very &s;oon after performed.</P>
<P>The ladies and gentlemen pa&s;s'd their evening together, &s;ometimes laughing at, but oftener pitying the unfortunate di&s;po&s;itions of the&s;e three melancholy
<PB N="100" REF="110">
objects, for &s;uch they deem'd 'em; and mo&s;t e&s;pecially &s;o, as their affluent for|tune was the unhappy means of power to make 'em expo&s;e their follies, and render them&s;elves more con&s;picuou&s;ly ridiculous to the world: truly, &s;aid Mi&s;s Evelyn, very innocently, I think 'twas very unlucky for Sir Boi&s;trous to be born to &s;uch an e&s;tate, upon which the re&s;t &s;miled, which &s;he perceiving, per&s;i&s;ted in her argument, alledging, that there was two good plowmen lo&s;t in the father and &s;on, and a &s;turdy dairy maid in the daughter. They could not but allow her argument to be ju&s;t, as what now appears gro&s;sly ab&s;urd in their behaviour, behind a plow, or in a chee&s;e-room, would have been received as the pure re&s;ult of natural &s;implicity: well poor &s;ouls, &s;aid &s;he, I pity 'em, and wi&s;h they were wi&s;er, or had no e&s;tate.</P>
<P>Here they were interrupted by the po&s;t &s;topping at the gate, with a letter from Mr. Evelyn to Mr. Dumont, the contents of which he directly communi|cated to the company:</P>

and being favour'd by the moon, reach'd down a pair of pi&s;tols, which were loaded with a brace of balls in each; while the ra&s;cal was a&s;cending the ladder, I had time to conceal my&s;elf on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the bed, behind the curtain; and as the villain approach'd, with what they call a &s;niggner-&s;ey, in order to cut my throat, I took the opportunity, e're he could be aware, to &s;hoot him, but it proved not to be mortal, the balls only breaking the main bone of his right arm, which was to have perpetrated the horrid murder.</P>
<P>The report of the pi&s;tol alarm'd the &s;ervants, who were in an in&s;tant a&s;&s;embled together, which put the re&s;t of the gang to the rout, and away they flew, leaving a bundle of cords, in their hurry, at the foot of the ladder.</P>
<P>When the &s;ervants had got po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the fellow, I ran to my lord to acquaint him with what had happen'd, who hear|tily thank'd heaven for our deliverance, and order'd a &s;urgeon to be &s;ent for, that the villain might be pre&s;erved for the hands of ju&s;tice; for fear of di&s;or|dering

The &s;ur|geon who &s;et his arm knew him, and di&s;cover'd to us his being the inhumane uncle of our dear friend Jennings; that having &s;pent the e&s;tate he feloniou&s;ly de|prived him of; he has &s;ince taken to robbery for &s;upport. He conceives young Jennings to be dead, in which I did not undeceive him, that he might not &s;hock the generous youth by an application to him in ca&s;e of danger, which, notwith|&s;tanding the injuries he has done him, I doubt not his a&s;&s;urance would prompt him to.</P>

<P>As &s;oon as Mr. Dumont had read the letter, he order'd po&s;t hor&s;es directly, for him&s;elf and one &s;ervant only, be&s;ide the po&s;t-boy; as &s;oon as he had equip'd him&s;elf for his journey, he &s;et out, re|&s;olving

<P>Mrs. Evelyn and her daughter would fain have order'd the coach, and have gone with Mr. Dumont, but he would not by any means permit them, till they could be at home in &s;afety.

<HEAD>CHAP. IX. Mr. <HI>Dumont</HI> arrives at <HI>Iver</HI>. By Accident another of the Gang is taken, by which Means the re&s;t are found. Young <HI>Boi&s;trous</HI> and his Si&s;ter make a Di&s;covery at <HI>Du|mont</HI>'s to the Father.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN Mr. Dumont got to his grand-papa's he &s;aw &s;everal men patroling round the hou&s;e, well arm'd, among which were &s;ome of the Count's own &s;ervants, who gently let him into the hou&s;e for fear of di&s;turbing his lord&s;hip, who had been very much indi&s;po&s;ed, from the &s;urprize, as well as from the afflicting pains of the gout. Mr. Dumont went directly to Mr. Eve|lyn's bedchamber, who was overjoy'd to &s;ee him, and highly applauded him for his filial tenderne&s;s and re&s;pect in ha&s;te|ning to the Count; he ro&s;e, and with much difficulty, per&s;waded Mr. Du|mont to go to bed till his lord&s;hip was

&s;tirring, then went to the &s;ervants, and order'd &s;ome wine to be mull'd, which threw him into a gentle repo&s;e till about ten o'clock; by that time he was pretty tolerably refre&s;h'd, then got up and went to pay his duty to his grand-papa who was highly plea&s;ed at the &s;ight of him; but a&s;ked him why he would run the ha|zard of the night to travel. The wor&s;t misfortune I could po&s;&s;ibly have met with on the road, my Lord, could not be half &s;o terrible as the agonizing pains my heart &s;u&s;tain'd, when I heard your life was in &s;uch imminent danger; nor would I, to have gain'd the empire of the world, have been ab&s;ent; from the moment I heard the news, my impatient duty and tendere&s;t affection, left no room for thought of any misfortune, but tho&s;e you were liable to from the hands of the&s;e profligate villains: and, now I am here, I am re&s;olved to have them pur|&s;ued throughout the globe, but I'll bring them to ju&s;tice. You may &s;pare your&s;elf that trouble child, &s;aid the Count, for there is a hue and cry after them already, there are &s;uch numbers in pu&s;uit of them it is impo&s;&s;ible but they mu&s;t be taken.

under&s;tand, &s;aid Dumont, your lord&s;hip has Jennings's uncle in cu&s;tody; why do you encumber your&s;elf with him here, let him be moved to jail? The Count told him the &s;urgeon had &s;trictly forbid it till the bone was knit; for that moving him would, very likely, throw him into a fever, which might carry him off; and he was di&s;empower'd from doing them any hurt, not only from a broken arm, but a &s;trong guard that was &s;et over him of &s;ix &s;turdy fellows, who attended him night and day.</P>
<P>This &s;atisfied Mr. Dumont, who waited with much impatience for his amend|ment, in order to get rid of him; Mr. Evelyn propo&s;ed &s;ending for the ladies from Tunbridge, which neither the Count or his grand&s;on would give into, judging it highly improper to alarm them by fears and dangers they might &s;o ea&s;ily avoid.</P>
<P>As villainy is ever watchful for its own undoing, &s;o it proved with this gang, who had &s;ecreted them&s;elves in a lone empty hou&s;e, upon Iver Heath, ta|king it by turns to go out and &s;teal fowls, or whatever el&s;e they could find for &s;upport, not daring to endeavour to

make off till the &s;earch begun to be a little cool. One of them going out in que&s;t of prey, rambled out about a mile and a half from their covert, and &s;pied a waggon which he knew by the people who were with it to be loaded with &s;mug|gled goods; he immediately ran and made information of it, and in a &s;hort time, the waggon was overtaken by &s;e|veral men on hor&s;eback, who &s;eized it, and the per&s;ons concerned with it.</P>
<P>It happened there was an old man, who being tired with travelling, got a ca&s;t in the waggon, to ea&s;e his aged legs for a few miles, who, when the waggon was &s;eized, was obliged to get out, and, to his great &s;urprize, &s;aw his own &s;on, which was this very villain whom he was in pur&s;uit of for the murder of his poor old mother, and intended to have done the &s;ame execution on the father, had he been in the way; but after having cut the good woman's throat from ear to ear, he had but ju&s;t time enough to make off with &s;eventy guineas, which was all the poor &s;ouls were worth in the world. The old man re&s;olving if po&s;&s;ible to find him out, &s;old off his goods, and had been two
<PB N="110" REF="120">
years in fruitle&s;s &s;earch of him, till that accident occa&s;ion'd their meeting; the pa|ricide was immediately &s;eized, and his villainous character was a means of e&s;cape for the poor &s;mugglers that time, who taking that advantage urged their inno|cence; and one of them who kept a &s;hop in London acknowledged the goods to be his, and all fairly purcha&s;ed; the officers who had made the &s;eizure, not being over wi&s;e, and a good deal &s;urpriz'd at the barbari&s;m of the informer, were ea&s;ily talked out of their &s;en&s;es, and believed all the &s;hopkeeper &s;aid in his defence. The old man was determined to make an example of his &s;on, who as he had di|ve&s;ted him&s;elf of the filial ties of nature and affection to the mother; the father thought the world could not reflect on him if he al&s;o laid a&s;ide the father in &s;o deplorable a circum&s;tance, to become the ju&s;tifiable pro&s;ecutor. Accordingly they went before a magi&s;trate, which very gentleman was &s;ent for to the Count's to receive the confe&s;&s;ion of old Jennings, he not being able to be carried to his hou&s;e at that time. When the villain found that the fact appear'd plain again&s;t
<PB N="111" REF="121" MS="Y">
him, and that the father had other evi|dences ready, on a proper &s;ummons, to corroborate what he had depo&s;ed; the mon&s;ter was determined not to die alone; and directly impeach'd the re&s;t of his accomplices, part of whom he &s;aid were his &s;educers to the perpetration of the horrid act. By his direction a &s;trong party was detached to &s;torm their ca&s;tle and take them all pri&s;oners; which news &s;oon reach'd the Count's ear who was greatly overjoy'd to hear it. But when Jennings was informed of it, he notwith|&s;tanding his misfortune, raved and &s;tor|med like a madman, &s;uppo&s;ing his date of life being almo&s;t at a period; but the generous Count in re&s;pect to his nephew, made great intere&s;t to have him tran&s;|ported for life; he would have gain'd him a pardon, but his crimes were &s;o heinous, that tran&s;portation was the ut|mo&s;t mercy he could obtain. The gang being all &s;ent to Newgate, many witne&s;&s;es appear'd again&s;t them, and they were tried and condemned the &s;e&s;&s;ions following. The wicked wretch who murdered his mother, was after his execution here, &s;ent down to be hung in chains where the
<PB N="112" REF="122" MS="Y">
fact was committed. The humane Count, who&s;e liberal heart and hand were ever ready to &s;uccour and com|fort the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, &s;ent the poor old fa|ther a hundred pounds to be put out to u&s;e for his &s;upport, during the few re|maining melancholy years he had to live. And that it might be laid out to the be&s;t advantage, Mr. Evelvn pur|chas'd for him an annuity for life, which brought him in a better revenue than he would have had from the common inte|re&s;t of Great Britain.</P>
<P>Mr. Dumont went &s;oon after this af|fair, back again to Tunbridge; not for|getting before he went, to mention Sir John's pa&s;&s;ion to his Grandpappa and Mr. Evelyn; both whom, were greatly pleas'd with the overture: and deter|mined, when Mi&s;s came to town, to u&s;e their utmo&s;t endeavours to bring the matter to bear.</P>
<P>Mr. Dumont at his return having told Sir John his &s;ucce&s;s with the Count and her Papa; encouraged him to make a de|claration of his affection to the young lady. But &s;he appeared very cold, and upon being acquainted with his pa&s;&s;ion,
<PB N="113" REF="123" MS="Y">
grew &s;hy of conver&s;ing with him, which gave her lover infinite pain.</P>
<P>However, he hoped that time might bring her to a more favourable thought of him, and greatly depended on the a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance of his friend Dumont in the affa$r, who was perfectly a&s;&s;iduous in his cau&s;e.</P>
<P>Sir Boi&s;trous Blunder having heard that Mr. Dumont was returned, &s;ent him word of his intention to wait on him next day; (which proved a very wet one) Mi&s;s arrived in the chariot, with her papa, in an old fa&s;hioned long riding-hood, with the head drawn over her face, as if &s;he had been chief mourner at a pari&s;h funeral; and that (accord|ing to her phra&s;e) &s;he might not whot her red morocco &s;hoes, which were gar|ni&s;hed with a yellow &s;ilk lace, to repre&s;ent a gold one; &s;he &s;tepped into her pattens, with which &s;he mo&s;t cruelly demoli&s;hed a very fine walk that led into the hou&s;e where Mr. Dumont lodged; by mo&s;t barbarou&s;ly indenting it with the rings, and throwing up the gravel before and behind &s;o vehemently, 'twas no &s;mall danger to the eyes of the company,
<PB N="114" REF="124">
who waited on her in, to walk near her.</P>
<P>When &s;he had got to the parlour-door, &s;he whipped off her pattens; in which, &s;he had thro' the moi&s;ture of the ground made a large collection; which &s;he civilly di&s;charged, by thumping 'em again&s;t the wain&s;coat in the entry; and to compleat her elegance, &s;et 'em down by the parlour-door. The rea&s;on that &s;he gave for &s;o doing was, her having lo&s;t a pair but the week before at a vi&s;it; but, &s;he &s;uppo&s;ed one of the maids of the hou&s;e had &s;tole 'em, an now the &s;teed's &s;tole, ecod! I'll lock the &s;table door, &s;afe bind, &s;afe find. After &s;he had taken this care, &s;he di&s;rob'd her|&s;elf of her wet cloak; which &s;he was going to hang upon a chair before the fire to dry; but Mr. Dumont, who promi&s;ed to be bound for its appearance, ordered one of the footmen to take it in|to the hall, till the lady call'd for it.</P>
<P>The Knight who was willing to guard again&s;t the chilly quality of the rain, had provided him&s;elf with a pipe; which he had pretty near &s;moaked out in the cha|riot; and being &s;eated in the parlour,
<PB N="115" REF="125" MS="Y">
decently da&s;hed it to pieces again&s;t the back of a chair, that &s;tood near him; they had not been there long, before the young &s;quire came hollowing along with Ringwood and Jowler; who &s;eemed to endeavour who &s;hould out do the other in noi&s;e; which being ob&s;erved by Sir John, he gave it in favour of the &s;quire, as being the loude&s;t proficient in this dogmatical concert.</P>
<P>Lord Worthland, who was one of the Knights of the Bath, unexpectedly dropt in, as he came from cour&s;ing; and was detained by Mr. Dumont to dinner, that he might partake of the felicity they promi&s;ed them&s;elves, from the com|pany of the other three vi&s;itants. As my Lord was but plainly dre&s;&s;ed for the morning, Mi&s;s conceived a very &s;trange notion of him; and after having gazed at him very attentively for about ten minutes, &s;he at la&s;t fixed her hands on each &s;ide, and bur&s;t into &s;uch a fit of laughing, the company began to think &s;he mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily expire. Her father who was plea&s;ed to &s;ee his daughter &s;o highly delighted; joined as heartily in the laugh, without knowing at what.

At la&s;t growing impatient to be inform|ed where the joke lay; prithee!

Oh!

<P>My Lord, to carry on the Joke, a&s;|&s;umed an awkward ba&s;hfulne&s;s, bowing and &s;craping in a thankful manner, for the notice Sir Boi&s;trous took of him; who promi&s;ed him the bu&s;ine&s;s of the whole pari&s;h, if ever he came his way.</P>
<P>His Lord&s;hip's &s;ucce&s;s with Sir Boi|&s;trous occa&s;ioned a violent laugh, which was &s;uddenly &s;unk into a profound &s;i|lence and re&s;pect, on the approach of Mi&s;s Evelyn; who&s;e lovely form natu|rally and unavoidably excited it.</P>

<P>Here their di&s;cour&s;e ended, by Mr. Joceline's enquiry about dinner, who being informed it would be a full hour before it was ready, a&s;&s;ured them his great guts were ready to eat up his little ones, that they had cried cupboard &s;ome time, I'cod the hounds and I &s;hall be fami&s;h'd; but how&s;omdever, &s;ays he, we'll be before-hand with you; and calling his two dear friends after him, he took a march into the kitchen, where he &s;tar'd at the variety of di&s;hes that were preparing, and except the fi&s;h, veni&s;on, and fowl, he could not con|ceive what the cooks were conjuring about, as he was plea&s;ed to term it; de|claring, he had never &s;een &s;uch me&s;&s;es in all his born days before; but that he
<PB N="120" REF="130">
might be &s;ure to eat &s;omething he had been u&s;ed to, he cut him&s;elf a thick piece of bread round a large loaf, and &s;lapp'd it into the dripping-pan, which when it had &s;oak'd up about a pound and half of fat, he returned to the com|pany with the &s;op dripping all the way, greas'd up to his eyes: Mi&s;s, who was as &s;harp &s;et as her brother, bounc'd from her chair and &s;eiz'd one half of it, &s;calding her mouth for fear he &s;hould &s;natch it back again. After they had maundered at each other and mu&s;led up the &s;op, the Squire whips up one of the nice pinch'd napkins that lay upon a plate, when, after having &s;ufficiently greas'd and towzell'd it about according to their politene&s;s, threw it on the mid|dle of the table. Mr. Dumont rung the bell for a &s;ervant to take it away, and place another in its &s;tead: but Mi&s;s Boi&s;trous in&s;i&s;ted upon having that, urging that wa&s;hing was very dear in that place, and that there was no need to be &s;o dainty, or &s;o wa&s;teful, that &s;he knew of. However, Mr. Dumont, in re&s;pect to the re&s;t of the company, had it taken away, for Mi&s;s and her bro|ther

had made it in &s;uch a filthy con|dition it turn'd their &s;tomachs; and the more &s;o, as they had both unfortunately made u&s;e of it in the capacity of a pocket handkerchief.</P>
<P>Dinner being at la&s;t brought in, the old gentleman thought there wou'd be no end of the proce&s;&s;ion of &s;ervants, there being &s;even, who brought in each a &s;eperate di&s;h, and cover'd the table very elegantly in two minutes time: among tho&s;e in the fir&s;t cour&s;e, there was a fine ragou, &s;ome of which being offered to Mi&s;s Ur&s;y, &s;he could not be per&s;waded to touch it, for that &s;he did not like the &s;ight of the rags and jags, it might poi&s;on her for what &s;he knew; but luckily for Mi&s;s, there was a young turkey pout; many of which &s;he had rear'd in her time; &s;o without ceremony, &s;he &s;lit it down the middle, and clapped it on her plate; turning the other half to her father, whom &s;he knew to be very fond of it. In &s;hort, not one of the three could be prevailed on to ta&s;te of any thing, but what they were perfectly ac|quainted with. When a very large haunch of veni&s;on was &s;et on the table,
<PB N="122" REF="132">
the knight and his two babes fairly picked the bone without any other per|&s;on partaking of it.</P>
<P>After a very elegant dinner con&s;i&s;ting of one and twenty di&s;hes, &s;even at a cour&s;e, the knight prote&s;ted had it not been for the fat haunch he &s;hould have ro&s;e hungry; and that for his part a gammon of bacon, or a round of beef was to him preferable to all the fine kick&s;haws that France or England could produce. In&s;tead of the variety of wines, of which there was abundance, he cho&s;e old Engli&s;h beer, of which he and the &s;quire and Mi&s;s drank &s;o plentifully, they were all three tolerably gay by that time dinner was ended.</P>
<P>When all was over and the &s;ervants withdrawn, Sir Boi&s;trous began to pro|po&s;e the matches he intended for his &s;on and daughter with Mr. Dumont and Mi&s;s Evelyn, addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to her mama, who in as civil a manner as &s;he po&s;&s;ibly could, at once gave him a po&s;itive denial, a&s;&s;uring him in a tender manner that notwith&s;tanding his having a good e&s;tare, there was &s;uch a di&s;proportion in their under&s;tandings, it would be impo&s;&s;ible

When the old gentleman heard this news, Mi&s;s was forced to fly, and the poor old man fairly fell into a convul&s;ion fit, occa&s;ion'd by the vio|lence of anger, and the prevention of his revenge on the objects of his fury.</P>

<P>IN a few days after the reconciliation, Sir Boi&s;trous went to his &s;eat in De|von&s;hire, and Mr. Dumont with the ladies, accompanied by Sir John Generous, &s;et out for Iver. Sir John did not fail to put his friend in mind of becoming his advo|cate in his love &s;uit; nor did he want the kind a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Count and Mr. and Mrs. Evelyn; but Mi&s;s, though &s;he
<PB N="130" REF="140">
would not pre&s;ume ab&s;olutely to refu&s;e, avoided all opportunities of being alone with her lover; and by a coldne&s;s and re&s;erve to him convinced the whole fa|mily of her aver&s;ion to the match. However the Count was re&s;olved to give his friend fair play for his life, which &s;eemed greatly to depend upon his &s;uc|ce&s;s with this inexorable fair; he gave him an invitation to pa&s;s the remaining part of the &s;ummer with them, that he might lo&s;e no ground in the pur&s;uit of his amour. Sir John's exce&s;&s;ive fond|ne&s;s was everla&s;tingly contriving &s;ome obliging means to recommend him to Mi&s;s's favour, but in vain! The utmo&s;t he could ever gain, was one day the confe&s;&s;ion of a friendly regard, a&s;&s;uring him he would not even pre&s;erve that long, &s;hould he per&s;i&s;t in endeavouring at any thing beyond it. Sir John thought him&s;elf ble&s;s'd in making that &s;mall progre&s;s towards her heart, and with infinite joy communicated it to the Count and her father; who &s;miling told him he mu&s;t have recour&s;e to patience; as he was obliged to go to London upon
<PB N="131" REF="141" MS="Y">
urgent bu&s;ine&s;s; but that at his return he would him&s;elf undertake his cau&s;e; at the &s;ame time giving him a&s;&s;ured hopes of &s;ucce&s;s. The fearful lover, though plea&s;ed with what Mr. Evelyn &s;aid, had not courage &s;ufficient to believe there was the lea&s;t probability of &s;ucceeding; however he promi&s;ed to remain as ea&s;y as po&s;&s;ible, and continued hourly to find new ways to make life agreeable to the young lady.</P>
<P>Mr. Evelyn's de&s;ign in going to London was to di&s;charge the debts which occa&s;ion'd his going abroad; as Providence had been bounteous in its di&s;pen&s;ations towards him, he thought the only in&s;tance he could give of a grateful &s;en&s;e of the Divine goodne&s;s, was to do ju&s;tice to his fellow creatures, whom he doubted not had &s;uffer'd many inconveniencies in being with-held from their rights, which his former indigence had for many years deprived them of. The Count though loth to lo&s;e &s;o much of his company, could not but applaud the piety of &s;o laudable a re&s;olution, and not only con&s;ented to his going, but
<PB N="132" REF="142">
generou&s;ly offer'd to give him any a&s;&s;i&s;tance he &s;hould require in the compleating his affairs. Mr. Evelyn in a mo&s;t re&s;pectful manner thank'd his lord&s;hip, but told him the honour and ble&s;&s;ing of his friend|&s;hip had empower'd him to make a perfect acquittance with intere&s;t to his creditors, and a thou&s;and pounds over and above what would &s;erve to that end; that he thought him&s;elf equally obliged to his lord&s;hip for the offer as if he had accepted it, but that he &s;hould e&s;teem it &s;uch an avaricious intru&s;ion on his friend|ly tenderne&s;s, which he never could forgive him&s;elf &s;hould he be guilty of it.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t inform the reader the worthy Count made Mr. Evelyn an offer of pay|ing his debts on his fir&s;t arrival into England, but as their acquaintance was then but of an early date, and Mr Eve|lyn's demands very con&s;iderable, on that account he cho&s;e rather to de&s;erve in &s;ome degree &s;o high an act of friend&s;hip, and give his noble patron leave to judge whether he might prove an object worthy of &s;uch infinite regard; therefore declined it till fortune had put it in his power to effect the bu&s;ine&s;s him&s;elf without being
<PB N="133" REF="143" MS="Y">
&s;o trouble&s;ome, as he deemed it, to a noble generous friend, and for no &s;ervice done to entitle him to a much le&s;s &s;hare of his tender concern.</P>
<P>The Count's retirement was a &s;uffici|ent &s;ecurity for Mr. Evelyn's per&s;on, whom his creditors concluded to be dead, till he advertized him&s;elf in order to con|vene them to receive their &s;everal dues. In about two days after he got to Lon|don they all a&s;&s;embled at the King's Arms the corner of St. Paul's Church-Yard; upon looking over his li&s;t of their names, he mi&s;&s;ed his chief creditor, which was one Mr. Powel a great linen-draper, whom they informed him had been dead &s;ome years; that his &s;on was living, but breaking in a &s;hort time after his father's death, was then in confinement in the Mar&s;hal&s;ea, where he had been upwards of two years very mi&s;erable, having no more than the groats allow'd him for his &s;upport; and as a farther addition to the weight of his misfortunes he had a wife and four chil|dren (the Elde&s;t of which was incapable of getting its living) and were frequently in want of bread. This &s;hocking relation
<PB N="134" REF="144">
gave &s;o violent an emotion to poor Mr. Evelyn's heart, he could not &s;uppre&s;s the tears from falling down his manly cheeks; then &s;triking his brea&s;t with vehemence, accu&s;ed him&s;elf as being, in part, an un|happy in&s;trument of the family's de|&s;truction! A chuck-headed ho&s;ier that had ju&s;t received his dividend, and had more money than humanity, per|ceiving the tender impre&s;&s;ion this me|lancholy tale had made on Mr. Evelyn, told him he wonder'd he &s;hould expre&s;s &s;o much concern for a &s;tranger; that any per|&s;on who was unacquainted with him, would imagine it to be his father by the agony he was in. No, Sir, replied the afflicted gen|tleman, I am not his father, but I have been unde&s;ignedly his enemy in keeping him from a ju&s;t demand, which had he been po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of might have been the happy means to have prevented the dreadful &s;cenes of wretchedne&s;s and &s;orrow he at pre&s;ent is immer&s;ed in; but &s;leep &s;hall never clo&s;e my eyes till I have made him the utmo&s;t reparation in my power. O lord, &s;aid the ho&s;ier! a trifle may do that, he's &s;o abominably poor you may get off that debt with a wet finger; two or three
<PB N="135" REF="145">
pieces will make the poor devils as happy as princes; fill their bellies and put a whole coat upon the poor fellow's back, for he is horrible ragged at pre&s;ent I can tell you.</P>
<P>Mr. Evelyn had not patience at the inhuman di&s;po&s;ition of this unchri&s;tian-like man, who could be &s;o in&s;en&s;ible of the misfortunes of his fellow-crea|ture; but with infinite indignation and contempt of his cruelty and grove|ling mind, he &s;tarted from his chair, wondring how it was po&s;&s;ible &s;uch wick|edne&s;s &s;hould infe&s;t the heart of man! Had my &s;entiments, Sir, &s;aid he, been concomitant with yours, you would never have received the trifling &s;um of ten pounds I ju&s;t now paid you with intere&s;t; and you mu&s;t naturally and rea&s;onably have branded me with the ju&s;t title of villain had I de|frauded you, when I had it &s;o amply in my power to do you ju&s;tice; then how much more &s;hould I de&s;erve that name &s;hould I withold the &s;um of near two hundred pounds from this unhappy man, who with his di&s;tre&s;&s;ed family are encompa&s;&s;ed with &s;orrows, and expo&s;ed to the pinching hand of bittere&s;t want. Nay, &s;aid the ho&s;ier
<PB N="136" REF="146">
with &s;ome confu&s;ion, I only &s;poke for your good, and to &s;ave your money. I &s;han't, &s;aid Mr. Evelyn, pay you the com|pliment of thanking you for that regard, nor do I ever de&s;ire to enrich my&s;elf at the expence of my humanity; and mo&s;t e&s;pecially &s;o when it is enforced by ju&s;tice. As a proof of my dete&s;tation of any action that is meanly, mercenary, or &s;ordidly ba&s;e, I &s;hall beg the favour of you all to leave me now, and de&s;ire your companies here to dinner to-morrow, that I may make the be&s;t advantage of time to fly to the immediate relief of this unhappy man.</P>
<P>The creditors (who were every one paid off) promi&s;ed to meet him next day ac|cording to appointment, expre&s;&s;ing many acknowledgments on Mr. Evelyn's good|ne&s;s in re&s;toring them their rights, when he had it &s;o greatly in his power (as they all conjectured him to have been dead) to have deprived them of them.</P>
<P>This worthy gentleman's impatience to ea&s;e Mr. Powel's tortured mind hur|ried him to Southwark, where he &s;top'd at a cloaths &s;hop and fitted him&s;elf with a compleat &s;uit of fine broad cloth, en|tirely

<P>Mr. Powel di&s;patch'd the porter with his letter to Mr. Evelyn; and the ma&s;ter of the jail &s;ent a tru&s;ty friend to Mrs. Powel with the money and glad tidings of her hu&s;band's better fortune; who poor woman was &s;carce able to &s;upport the tide of joy that flow'd round her heart at the recital.</P>
<P>Mr. Evelyn came on the receipt of Mr. Powel's Epi&s;tle, who waited in the yard to receive him. At the &s;ight of this worthy gentleman, Mr. Powel endea|vour'd to give utterance to his grateful joy; which rais'd &s;o &s;trong a conflict in his brea&s;t he was entirely dive&s;ted of the power of expre&s;&s;ion, but by his looks,
<PB N="142" REF="152" MS="Y">
which were certain indications of the tu|multuous tran&s;ports of his &s;oul. As &s;oon as he had collected him&s;elf, and was able to te&s;tify in words how much he thought him&s;elf obliged by Mr. Evelyn's huma|nity, he did it in &s;uch a manner, that convinced his benefactor his pre&s;ent and future regard to him were not, nor ever would be mi&s;employed.</P>
<P>Mr. Powel found relief from the grateful tribute of his tears, which affect|ed Mr. Evelyn &s;o tenderly, he made an equal retribution; and finding the other under confu&s;ion, gave him time to over|come it, by opening to him the cau&s;e of his care and concern for him. I believe, Sir, &s;aid he, the infancy of your days when I was acquainted with your father, and twenty years ab&s;ence have render'd it impo&s;&s;ible for you to remember your having ever &s;een me, you being but five years of age when I left England. I have, &s;aid Mr. Powel, Sir, but an imperfect know|ledge of you, and can ju&s;t remember that there was a gentleman of the name of Evelyn, who frequently did my father the honour of vi&s;iting him, which I &s;up|po&s;e, Sir, to be your worthy &s;elf. The

&s;ame, an&s;wered Mr. Evelyn, in the juvenile part of my life, I dealt very largely with your good father, till misfortunes fell thick upon me, from a con&s;iderable lo&s;s I had in venturing the be&s;t part of what I was worth at &s;ea, which was confounded in one fatal hour, by a dreadful &s;hipwreck.</P>
<P>Upon examination into my circum|&s;tances, I had &s;oon rea&s;on to believe I was not worth a &s;hilling I could call my own; for as &s;oon as I had embark'd my fortune, which I did in hopes of an improvement of it, I was reduced to live upon credit, till the return of the &s;hip; but it plea&s;ed Heaven to order it otherwi&s;e, and all the tidings I ever gained, was a confirmation of my ruin; by this time I was con&s;iderably involved.</P>
<P>Among the number of tho&s;e who gave me credit, was your generous fa|ther; to whom I was indebted a hun|dred and &s;eventy pounds, which now in right is yours. In &s;hort, when the re&s;t of my creditors pre&s;&s;ed me hard, in&s;omuch that I was not able to appear abroad, meeting your father one Sun|day unawares, I &s;trove to &s;hun him; but his good nature pur&s;ued me with
<PB N="144" REF="154">
a &s;mile, begging me to &s;top; which I was then in good manners com|pelled to; and in&s;tead of the har&s;h threats I had received from others, he went into a tavern; and upon hear|ing the melancholy &s;ituation of my affairs, bid me never apprehend any danger from him; adding, that he could not ea&s;ily forget the obliga|tions he was plea&s;ed to think him&s;elf under to me, when I was in the po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of an affluent fortune; having dealt with him for near two thou&s;and pounds at different times with ready money. Nor would he permit me to leave him, till he gave me a draught upon a merchant in the city for twenty guineas to &s;upply my pre&s;ent nece&s;&s;ities. I offered him a note or bond to be drawn up the next day, which he re&s;olutely refu&s;ed; a&s;&s;uring me, he de&s;ired no o|ther &s;ecurity, than my word of ho|nour, to repay it whenever it &s;hould be in my power; or if otherwi&s;e, to accept on it as a gratuity, for the favours he had formerly received of me.</P>
<P><PB N="145" REF="155">In &s;hort, my circum&s;tances grew wor&s;e and wor&s;e every day, without any pro&s;pect of amendment; and I was forced contrary to my inclination with a trifling remainder of my wife's fortune, to &s;et out for France, or to run the hazard of a jail in Eng|land.</P>
<P>In this retreat I met with a nobleman, with whom I have lived the&s;e twenty years; and in who&s;e &s;ervice I &s;till remain. And have happily ama&s;&s;ed a compe|tence to &s;atisfy all whom I was the lea&s;t indebted to; and have this very day to the la&s;t penny di&s;charged.</P>
<P>Upon enquiry after your father, I was informed of his decea&s;e, and your misfortunes; and think this the happie&s;t part of my life in having it in my power not only to give you relief, but pay the re&s;pect I owe to the memory of my wor|thy friend, in laying a foundation for the future happine&s;s of his &s;on. Then taking out Bank notes to the amount of five hundred pounds, de&s;ired Mr. Powel not to con&s;ider the overplus as a gift, but as a debt due to him in re&s;pect of the tender friend&s;hip he met with from
<PB N="146" REF="156" MS="Y">
his father, to prevent the calamities he mu&s;t but for his bounty been expo&s;ed to.</P>
<P>Mr. Powel was &s;o charmed with Mr. Evelyn's noblene&s;s of &s;oul, that he for a little time &s;at mute, and fixed in a plea|&s;ing a&s;toni&s;hment at his uncommon virtue. He begged he would excu&s;e him, &s;aying all his mind &s;ugge&s;ted, as 'twas impo&s;&s;ible to do ju&s;tice to his me|rit: that tho' it required an abler tongue than his, to &s;peak his prai&s;e, he a&s;&s;ured him, he was not wanting of a true and perfect &s;en&s;e of his ine&s;timable worth.</P>
<P>Mr. Evelyn &s;ent by Mr. Powel's di|rection, for the per&s;on who had put him in confinement, with an order to bring his lawyer directly; that Mr. Powel might be relea&s;ed without delay.</P>
<P>The me&s;&s;enger made as quick di&s;patch as po&s;&s;ible, and brought the lawyer and plaintiff; the latter was an exact and proper figure, to repre&s;ent Mr. Trap|land in the comedy of Love for Love. His diminutive figure and care-worn a&s;pect, gave a perfect idea of his pro|fe&s;&s;ion; u&s;ury &s;at triumphant on his &s;urrowed front, and his contracted brow &s;trongly de&s;cribed the &s;tern impatience
<PB N="147" REF="157">
and malicious revenge on many a haple&s;s per&s;on; who&s;e nece&s;&s;ity, oftener than inclination, expo&s;es them to the in&s;atiate cruelty, ari&s;ing from the power tho&s;e wretches have over the unfortunate.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding this avaricious mor|tal was going to receive all that was due to him, he di&s;cover'd &s;uch a rancourous di&s;po&s;ition, and unwillingne&s;s to &s;ee his fellow creature di&s;burthen'd of his af|fliction, that he endeavoured to puzzle the cau&s;e, and detain the poor gentle|man longer in that di&s;mal abode of mi&s;ery and grief; which Mr. Evelyn ob|&s;erving, reprimanded him &s;everely, and upon examining the account between them, found he had lent the principal upon &s;uch exorbitant intere&s;t, it amount|ed to double the &s;um of the debt; at la&s;t, after many di&s;putes, Mr. Evelyn obliged him to take no more than what was allowed by act of parliament; or &s;tand the proce&s;s of a law &s;uit, as an extortioner; by which means, he was not only liable to a puni&s;hment for the crime, but in danger of lo&s;ing the whole money. With many bitter invectives on his part, he was forced
<PB N="148" REF="158">
to a compliance, and Mr. Powel hap|pily delivered from his power.</P>
<P>Mr. Evelyn took his new acquain|tance to the tavern, and would have &s;ent for Mrs. Powel, but her hu&s;band excu&s;ed her appearance; telling his friend, that &s;he was &s;o terribly reduced, by having parted with all that was valu|able for their &s;upport, &s;he was now be|come the cruel &s;corn and contempt even of tho&s;e who once thought them&s;elves ble&s;t in her acquaintance; that as &s;oon as &s;he was in a condition to pay her re&s;pects, (which he promi&s;ed &s;hould be the next day) &s;he &s;hould not fail to join with him in her grateful acknow|ledgements. As to acknowledgements, replied Mr Evelyn, there are none due; what I have done this day, was but a duty incumbent on my&s;elf, and to my&s;elf; and think, that I am the only obliged per&s;on from the beginning to the end of this affair; as heaven has graciou&s;ly and providentially empow'red me to re&s;tore to every one, what was but their legal claim.</P>
<P>However, Sir, continued he, &s;ince 'tis inconvenient for Mrs. Powel to
<PB N="149" REF="159" MS="Y">
come to you, 'twill be cruelty longer to detain you from her. Giving him a direction to his lodgings in Southamp|ton &s;treet, Covent Garden, to come to him at nine next morning, they part|ed, and Mr. Powel took coach, or|dering the man to &s;et him down in Bloom&s;bury-&s;quare. His wife's lodg|ings being in one of the narrow &s;treets in Saint Giles's; and then making a genteel appearance, did not care the fel|low &s;hould be witne&s;s of the di&s;mal place he was going to.</P>
<P>Mrs. Powel on hearing his voice, coming down with eager joy to meet and bid him wellcome, was &s;o overcome with tran&s;port at &s;eeing him, &s;he fainted in his arms; and was no &s;ooner brought out of one fit, then it was &s;ucceeded by another, which continued for near half an hour. But by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of a good natur'd poor woman that lodged there, they at la&s;t brought her to her&s;elf.</P>
<P>The landlady, to whom Mrs. Powel was pretty deeply indebted, having no other &s;en&s;e but the joyful expectation of receiving her money, left the poor &s;oul in that fainting condition, to take a
<PB N="150" REF="160">
regular march through the neighbour|hood, to inform them, that long look'd for was come at la&s;t; adding, very &s;hrewdly, that if Mr. Powel did not pay to the la&s;t farthing &s;he wi&s;hed &s;he might be totally d&mdash;n'd, if &s;he would not &s;end him back to his old lodging. And for fear of di&s;appointment, was re&s;olving within her&s;elf to go directly to a lawyer, to take out a writ again&s;t him; till a per&s;on who &s;tood by, threatened to &s;et the mob upon her, if &s;he went a &s;tep farther than her own hou&s;e, till &s;he had &s;poke with Mr. Powel.</P>
<P>Such was the brutality and &s;avage temper of this wretch, who in&s;tead of commi&s;erating the long &s;cene of &s;or|row he had &s;uffered, and bearing a part in the extatic joy, all humane hearts mu&s;t naturally feel on &s;o unexpected a re|demption from the &s;harpe&s;t mi&s;ery: this mon&s;ter was immediately con|triving fre&s;h plagues to embitter and corrode his growing happine&s;s. But that was not in her power; for at her return, Mr. Powel demanded his bill, and in&s;tantly di&s;charged it. Upon which, the hypocritical jade's tone was turn'd,
<PB N="151" REF="161">
with many a&s;&s;urances of her regard for him and his family; that &s;he ne|ver in the lea&s;t doubted her money, whenever 'twas in their power; had it been ten times the &s;um, they &s;hould have been wellcome. She always thought Mr. Powel, tho' he was an unfortunate, yet he was an hone&s;t man. Pray Sir, what will you and madam be plea&s;ed to drink? Lord ble&s;s me! where are the little dear babies? out at play I warrant 'em. Lord, Sally, &s;peaking to her daughter) do you go and &s;ee for 'em, and tell them, Sir is come, I dare &s;ay they are hungry; here, reach me the pye out of the cupboard, plea&s;e God, they &s;hall have their bellies full. The di&s;&s;embling bea&s;t, (who had before u&s;ed Mrs. Powel and her infants with the ut|mo&s;t barbari&s;m, frequently in&s;ulting her on account of her hu&s;band's misfortunes) concluded that Mr. Powel would remain in her lodging; applying her&s;elf to his wife, plea&s;e the lord, &s;aid &s;he, we'll put up the blue curtains, and &s;et a chair or two, and a table in the room, you can't have a prettier nor a plea&s;anter room when I have furni&s;hed it. By the by, &s;he
<PB N="152" REF="162">
allowed Mrs. Powel neither chair nor &s;tool, but &s;he and her little ones were forced to &s;it and pa&s;s their melancholly hours on the floor.</P>
<P>Mr. Powel told her, &s;he need not give her&s;elf that unnece&s;&s;ary trouble, for that he &s;hould remove his fami|ly that evening.</P>
<P>The &s;lut ob&s;erving Mr. Powel to have a large quantity of gold, having changed a note of five and twenty pounds, as he drove home, at a friend's hou&s;e$; who gave him and his family an in|vitation till they could &s;ettle them|&s;elves. She had an hawk's eye at it, and &s;eem'd very much di&s;turbed at his leaving her; promi&s;ing to make eve|ry thing agreeable to him, if he would &s;tay; which he po&s;itively a&s;&s;ured her he would not. Then de&s;ired Mrs. Per|kins (who was always as friendly to Mrs. Powel, as her unhappy low circum|&s;tances would permit) to go and fetch as many nece&s;&s;aries out of pawn for his wife and children, as would furni&s;h 'em to go to their friend's hou&s;e.</P>
<P>While &s;he was gone, the little &s;ouls came home, and expre&s;t as much tran|&s;port
<PB N="153" REF="163" MS="Y">
at the &s;ight of their father, as could be po&s;&s;ibly expected from their tender a|ges. Mrs. Powel began to clean and pre|pare them to be dre&s;&s;ed, as &s;oon as Mrs. Perkins returned; which &s;he did with the utmo&s;t expedition. Mr. Powel pre&s;ented her with a crown piece for her trouble; which the landlady &s;eeing, forced the poor creature to pay her directly in part of what &s;he owed, threatning to turn her out of her lodging if &s;he did not let her have all the re&s;t, as &s;oon as the two coats &s;he had in hand were quilted. The poor creature, for the &s;ake of a quiet life, was obliged to comply; tho' &s;he prote&s;ted, &s;he had not another farthing in the world.</P>
<P>Mr. Powel, who had &s;o lately felt the bitter pains of poverty, bore &s;o large a part in the poor woman's affliction, he de&s;ired to know how much &s;he owed this greedy mortal? Which, &s;he &s;aid, was eight and thirty &s;hillings, but as &s;oon as it had mounted up to forty, &s;he'd have &s;ent her over the water, &s;he vow'd. Upon which Mrs. Perkins bur&s;t into tears: but Mr. Powel &s;oon turn'd her &s;orrow into joy, as &s;he was
<PB N="154" REF="164">
an hone&s;t, indu&s;trious, woman, paying her debt, and hiring her as a &s;ervant to wait on the children, and took her away with him that evening.</P>
<P>This made the wretch ten times more mad than &s;he was before, to have her lodgings &s;tripped of all her tenants at once; but to &s;ooth her grief, &s;he im|mediately had recour&s;e to her Anni&s;eed water bottle, which &s;he ply'd very clo&s;e|ly. And when the coach drove away with Mr. Powel and his family, attend|ed by Mrs. Perkins; &s;he was &s;o fortified with the &s;trength of the creature, and finding her&s;elf dive&s;ted of all future hopes of gain, in bitterne&s;s of rage, fell to clapping her hands, and ble&s;&s;ing her &s;tars, that &s;he had got rid of the noi&s;y crew, (meaning the poor children) damning them all for a parcel of jail birds; and bawling as loud as &s;he could, a&s;ked Mr. Powel, how long he thought he &s;hould keep out of the Mar&s;hal&s;ea? As the coach moved &s;lowly, on account of the young ones, he had the plea&s;ure of hearing her di&s;cour&s;e the length of a &s;treet; which &s;erved them to laugh at,
<PB N="155" REF="165">
and reflect on the mi&s;ery, the want of &s;en&s;e and humanity expo&s;ed any one to, who laboured under that misfortune.</P>
<P>Mr. Powel's friend had prepared an elegant &s;upper for him, and waited at the &s;treet-door to give him the earlie&s;t welcome po&s;&s;ible, expre&s;&s;ing an un|bounded plea&s;ure in &s;eeing him and fa|mily again re&s;tored to happine&s;s.</P>
<P>After &s;upper, Mr. Powel gave his friend an account of Mr. Evelyn, who was the occa&s;ion next to Heaven of that pro&s;pect of comfort that lay before him.</P>

A Di&s;covery of her Pa&s;&s;ion for another. A De&s;cription of his Per&s;on. Sir <HI>John</HI> dies.</HEAD>
<P>AT nine next morning, Mr. Powel and his wife went to pay their re|&s;pects to Mr. Evelyn, who was greatly plea&s;ed to &s;ee the transformation in Mrs. Powel, from what her hu&s;band had the day before de&s;cribed to him concerning her appearance.</P>
<P>Mr. Evelyn de&s;ired Mr. Powel to give him his hi&s;tory from the time of his father's death, which he did as follows.</P>
<P><PB N="157" REF="167">When my father died, Sir, &s;aid he, he left behind him two daughters, and my&s;elf; but as my &s;i&s;ters had five hun|dred pounds apiece left them by an uncle who was an old batchelor, he on|ly doubled their portions; leaving me a thou&s;and pounds and his &s;tock in trade; all which was free from any in|cumbrance, and amounted to about a thou&s;and pounds more.</P>
<P>I had then been married about two years, and was ble&s;&s;ed with two lovely boys which are &s;till living. Our family being but &s;mall, and our hou&s;e extreme|ly large; to lighten the burthen of a heavy rent, we concluded to take in boarders; which we &s;oon did, unhappily for me! as it laid the foundation for all the misfortunes I &s;ince have undergone.</P>
<P>A well dre&s;t gentleman, coming one day to my &s;hop, after having laid out a con&s;iderable &s;um of money; a&s;ked me, if I knew where he could be accommo|dated with a genteel apartment, for a couple of months; which was the time he propo&s;ed to &s;tay in town. That his bu&s;ine&s;s here was to attend a law|&s;uit, in which he was pretty certain of his
<PB N="158" REF="168">
carrying the day, as his cau&s;e was ju&s;t. That he had been above three years en|deavouring to recover an e&s;tate, which he had been wrongfully kept out of by a di&s;tant relation, who took the advan|tage of his being in the Indies to get po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it when his brother died, who left it him.</P>
<P>I being very young, and entirely un|&s;killed in the ba&s;e practices of the world, immediately propo&s;ed the &s;tranger's coming to live at our hou&s;e, as his ap|pearance and behaviour, I thought, was a &s;ufficient recommendation, without any farther enquiry.</P>
<P>Accordingly we agreed, and he came the next day, having bought as much Holland and Cambrick as was to make him three dozen of &s;hirts, be&s;ides a &s;uitable quantity of fine Mu&s;lin for cravats. He gave them to my wife's care, to be put them out to be made for him; all which was accompli&s;hed with the utmo&s;t ha&s;te, and he paid ready money for the making of them, as &s;oon as they were brought home; as indeed he did the fir&s;t five weeks con&s;tantly di&s;charge his lodging and board. His conver&s;ation was perfectly
<PB N="159" REF="169">
agreeable, and we grew mighty fond of his company. He pa&s;&s;ed all his lei|&s;ure hours with us, that he could &s;pare from his attendence on his law &s;uit. In &s;hort, he ingratiated him&s;elf &s;o much into both my wife's favour and mine, that we never thought our&s;elves compleatly happy without him.</P>
<P>About the &s;eventh week of his being with us, he came home from Lincolns-Inn Hall; where, he &s;aid, his cau&s;e was tried, and appeared very melancholly; which I ob&s;erving, a&s;ked him the rea&s;on? The rea&s;on, &s;aid he, Mr. Powel, 'tis e|nough to di&s;tract me, to think that I have &s;pent &s;uch immen&s;e &s;ums in defence of this cau&s;e, and mu&s;t lo&s;e it for want of four hundred pounds more to carry on; and tho' I have a pretty e&s;tate, yet I'm &s;o circum&s;tanced at pre&s;ent, I can't command &s;uch a &s;um as that the&s;e &s;ix months. Upon this, I a&s;ked him where his e&s;tate lay? he told me, by the lands end, in Cornwal; then proceeded again in his vexation, to think he &s;hould be liable to lo&s;e five hundred a year (to which he &s;aid he had an undoubted right) for want of four hundred pounds.</P>
<P><PB N="160" REF="170">I heartily commi&s;erated his misfor|tune, and a&s;&s;ured him, if I could by any means be &s;erviceable to him, I would. To which he directly replied, why, Mr. Powel, if you know any body that can furni&s;h me with &s;uch a parcel of money, for &s;ix months, I'll allow them twenty per Cent. and give them a bond for a payment at the expiration of that time.</P>
<P>I told him, I'd con&s;ider on't, and let him know the next day. When I went to bed, I con&s;ulted with my wife, who was equally concern'd for his di&s;tre&s;s. Upon the whole we concluded to let him have the money our&s;elves.</P>
<P>When I ro&s;e, being willing to put him out of his pain, informed him of my de&s;ign to draw upon the bank; he was extreamly overjoy'd, and &s;eem'd very thankful; de&s;iring me either to get a bond filled up my&s;elf, or his lawyer &s;hould do it, while I was gone for the money.</P>
<P>Not having the lea&s;t doubt of his doing any thing that was wrong, I left it to him; and in about two hours the matter was ended; and away he went, as he &s;aid to the lawyer. I having at
<PB N="161" REF="171">
that time a demand upon a per&s;on who had been in my books longer than I cho&s;e, de&s;ired this gentleman to take a line to him; &s;o only writing a couple of lines on the top, &s;ub&s;cribed my name at the very bottom of the paper, by which means a large vacancy was left, which this villain (&s;o I mu&s;t call him) tearing off the letter, fill'd up with a promi&s;&s;ary note on demand for two hundred pounds, with my own hand to witne&s;s again&s;t me at the bottom. Being &s;omewhat cha|grin'd with the per&s;on I wrote to, I made an abrupt conclu&s;ion only &s;igning my name. This cruel wretch ob&s;erving that I had laid his bond in my &s;crutore, beg'd the favour in a few days after that I would let him write a letter on it; I in|nocently, though &s;tupidly, giving him the key, he found an opportunity of &s;lipping the bond into his pocket; and the very next day while we were all at church, being Sunday, by help of his emi&s;&s;aries, convey'd his cloaths away and went be|yond &s;ea, leaving the note in a lawyer's hands to put it in force again&s;t me, and remit him the money as quick as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P><PB N="162" REF="172">In about a fortnight after his elope|ment I was arre&s;ted for the two hundred pounds; and going to my &s;crutore to &s;earch for the bond to prove how much he was in my debt, was &s;oon convinced of his knavi&s;h and barbarous de&s;ign in writing his pretended letter; in &s;hort, I put in bail, and &s;tood the te&s;t of a law|&s;uit, in which I was ca&s;t; the expences of which, and the lo&s;&s;es I had before &s;u&s;tain'd entirely ruin'd me, and brought on the dreadful &s;cenes of mi&s;ery my poor family and I have &s;ince endured, and mu&s;t have &s;till undergone, had not, by Heaven's permi&s;&s;ion, your timely &s;uccour, Sir, interpo&s;ed. My two &s;i&s;ters were luckily removed before this villain|ous wretch came acquainted with me; otherwi&s;e it is not impo&s;&s;ible, but they might have been al&s;o made a prey to his barbarity; but they being under age, and my father dead, their guardian took them intirely to his care; and he being a man that traded to different parts of the world took them with him, delivering them to his wife's charge, and it is many years &s;ince I heard from them; the la&s;t
<PB N="163" REF="173">
intelligence I had was, that they were in Holland, nor do I know if they are living.</P>
<P>Mr. Evelyn told him he was very &s;orry that his humanity &s;hould have been &s;o gro&s;ly impo&s;ed on, but de&s;ired to know what he propo&s;ed to do for a future maintenance? His an&s;wer was, that he had thoughts of endeavouring to im|prove the money Mr. Evelyn had &s;o ge|nerou&s;ly &s;urni&s;h'd him with, by going abroad; that as he under&s;tood merchan|dize tolerably well, he rather cho&s;e to &s;ettle among &s;trangers, conceiving he &s;hould have a better chance $word$ thriving, than among tho&s;e who had formerly pre|tended to be his friends.</P>
<P>Mr. Evelyn approved of his de&s;ign, and gave him a recommendatory letter to Mr. Jennings, advi&s;ing him to &s;ettle in that colony; as he was well a&s;&s;ured that gentleman would prove a worthy friend to him on his account. While Mr. Evelyn &s;taid in town Mr. Powel was continually with him; but before he left London he had the &s;atisfaction to &s;ee this late unfor|tunate man, with h$s family, take &s;hipping for the We&s;t-Indies, of which a farther account will be given hereafter.</P>
<P><PB N="164" REF="174">Mr. Evelyn met his trade&s;men as he had appointed, who one and all began to en|quire after poor Powel; and it was with infinite plea&s;ure he inform'd them that he had a very fair pro&s;pect before him of being a much happier man than ever; that he was relea&s;ed from pri&s;on, and freed from all incumbrances; he re|ceived an univer&s;al applau&s;e for &s;o ge|nerous an action, which they &s;aid mu&s;t perpetuate his memory, and &s;ecure to him eternal happine&s;s both in this world and the next.</P>
<P>Mr. Evelyn having entirely accom|pli&s;h'd his affairs, returned to Iver, where he found Sir John Generous in a lan|gui&s;hing condition, which Mi&s;s Evelyn's &s;corn had occa&s;ioned; the Count and her papa con&s;ulted together a con&s;iderable time what &s;hould be the cau&s;e of her ob&s;tinate refu&s;al; and as neither of them could a&s;&s;ign any, Mr. Evelyn was re&s;o|lutely determined not to let her blindly oppo&s;e her intere&s;t. As there was no &s;ort of objection that could po&s;&s;ibly be made to Sir John, he took her &s;everely to ta&s;k about him; but &s;he only an&s;wer'd him with tears; at la&s;t he told her it was the

So bidding her con&s;ider on what he had propo&s;ed, &s;he withdrew into her bedchamber; where her own maid who &s;et at work, perceiving her young lady to be under infinite confu&s;ion, took the liberty to intreat to know the rea&s;on; which Mi&s;s unable to re&s;olve her, throw|ing her&s;elf on the bed, bur&s;t into a tor|rent of &s;orrow, which la&s;ted for &s;ome time; her maid, who was extremely fond of her, could not bear to &s;ee her to greatly afflicted; and being a young woman of a tolerable &s;hare of &s;en&s;e, in the tendere&s;t manner importuned Mi&s;s ro ea&s;e her anxiety, by unburdening her mind to her, with a firm a&s;&s;urance, with|out her permi&s;&s;ion, never to di&s;clo&s;e the motive of her grief.</P>

The tender mother &s;oon obey'd the &s;ummons, and be&s;eech'd her daughter to unfold the my&s;tery which gave birth to this unutterable grief!</P>
<P>Oh! Madam, an&s;wer'd the young lady, there is a cau&s;e, and indeed a guiltle&s;s one; but I conjure you by all the fond maternal love you have ever &s;hewn me, do not in&s;i&s;t upon my making a di&s;covery of it. The count's unlimited bounty to my deare&s;t fa|ther, conjoin'd with his commands, are notwith&s;tanding my di&s;tre&s;s, too powerful motives for me to dare to di&s;obey them, and though my &s;oul abhors even the very mention of this alliance, I am re|&s;olved to &s;acrifice my peace to gratitude and duty; I both believe and wi&s;h my compliance may end a life I once thought happy; but from the hour I e&s;pou&s;e Sir John, I &s;hall date its mi&s;ery to the la&s;t moment of my exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>Her tender mother, though &s;he did not in&s;i&s;t on knowing who the per&s;on was, ea&s;ily conceived that her daughter's

<P>Poor Mrs. Evelyn's grief on this ac|count was inexpre&s;&s;ible from the fears of lo&s;ing her darling child, which &s;he ap|prehended would be the fatal con&s;equence of her marriage. As &s;he was fully con|vinced of her being violently in love in another place; what to do &s;he could not tell, as &s;he was with her daughter equally compell'd by a grateful &s;en&s;e of the Count's goodne&s;s (who was &s;trenuous for the match) and an implicit obedience to her hu&s;band. She left Mi&s;s with her maid, and went directly to Mr. Evelyn with the relation of all that had pa&s;&s;ed, not daring to in&s;inuate to him what &s;he
<PB N="168" REF="178">
conjectured in re&s;pect to her daughter's inclination to &s;ome other; however, &s;he u&s;ed many arguments to di&s;&s;wade him from the marriage, but in vain; he alledging that as Mi&s;s would give no other rea&s;on than merely not caring to marry, he &s;hould po&s;itively in&s;i&s;t upon it, being well a&s;&s;ured Sir John Generous was capable of making her one of the happie&s;t women in the univer&s;e; then charged his wife to let her know that in three days the nuptials were to be &s;olem|nized.</P>
<P>When Mi&s;s received the news &s;he fainted away, and continued doing &s;o for near the &s;pace of an hour; her afflicted mother would fain have return'd to Mr. Evelyn, but Mi&s;s would not &s;uffer her; telling her that the &s;ooner &s;he was mar|ried, &s;o much &s;ooner her life and mi&s;ery would end together. Accordingly the marriage was &s;olemnized, the Count gave her away, and Sir John thought him&s;elf the happie&s;t of mankind, while lady Ge|nerous (for &s;o we mu&s;t call her now) was exactly the rever&s;e. When the ceremony was ended &s;he fell into a &s;woon in the church, and it was with difficulty they
<PB N="169" REF="179">
brought her back to life; the bride|groom was like a di&s;tracted creature with the dreadful apprehen&s;ion of her lo&s;s, and with the tendere&s;t endearments try'd to &s;ooth her &s;orrow; he and Mr. Du|mont led her to Sir John's own coach, &s;upporting her all the way.</P>
<P>This violent grief was a terrible &s;hock to her new made hu&s;band, for whom her good nature, notwith&s;tanding her aver|&s;ion to the match, was not a little con|cern'd, at being the unhappy cau&s;e of the affliction &s;he perceived he underwent on her account.</P>
<P>The reader may &s;uppo&s;e there was no extraordinary rejoicing at this wedding, for poor Lady Generous's grief &s;welled up &s;o high, &s;he fell into a violent fever, in which &s;he continued near two months, and was given over by the phy&s;icians; but it plea&s;ed heaven to &s;pare her. Du|ring the time of her illne&s;s her fond hu&s;band, who doated on her to exce&s;s, never &s;tirred from her night or day, till by continual watching he was almo&s;t in as bad a condition as his lady; but Mr. Evelyn interpo&s;ed his authority, and in|&s;i&s;ted on his endeavouring to re&s;t, which

In one piece &s;he had drawn her&s;elf with Mr. Dumont in mi|niature, at full length, pre&s;enting him a bleeding heart, &s;hading her lovely eyes with a veil of cypre&s;s, which her other

<P>The fatal day being come that was to &s;eparate her from this much loved object, a fre&s;h &s;cene of woe appear'd; the only con&s;olation &s;he received was in having the plea&s;ure of her mama's company to her new &s;eat, which in her deplorable &s;tate of mind &s;he would have joyfully exchanged for her grave.</P>

When he approach'd
<PB N="173" REF="183" MS="Y">
tears filled his eyes at the thoughts of parting, which was only the re&s;ult of an innocent and &s;incere friend&s;hip, that grew between them from infancy, and &s;trengthened as their years encrea&s;ed: Happy had it been if Mr. Dumont's heart had received the &s;ame fond im|pre&s;&s;ion for the lady, as &s;he felt for him, but fate had otherwi&s;e decreed! When he gently took her hand, and pre&s;&s;ing forward to &s;alute her, &s;he drop'd in all appearance dead at his foot, which alarm'd the young gentleman extreamly, giving him a pain inconceivable to &s;ee her in that condition; he was going to call out for help, but her mama prevented him, and with their a&s;&s;i&s;tance &s;he was brought to her&s;elf again. After the ea&s;e of a &s;ad &s;hower of tears, &s;he began to be a little more compo&s;ed.</P>
<P>Mrs. Evelyn being a&s;&s;ured that the ceremony of a formal leave between them would only relap&s;e her into a &s;econd tor|rent of grief, beckon'd Mr. Dumont out of the room; and de&s;ired him not to &s;ee her any more, till he went to pay a vi&s;it in Northumberland, whither he would have gone at that time, but that he was

obliged to &s;tay with his Grand-papa. Mr. Dumont ob&s;erved Mrs. Evelyn's directions, and went out of the way till they were all &s;et forward on their journey.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding this young gentleman was in the eye of every beholder, the compleate&s;t and fine&s;t figure of a man that ever graced a court, or charm'd the heart of woman, he was the only in&s;en&s;ible per&s;on of tho&s;e happy attractions; there|fore had no other conception of Lady Generous's di&s;tre&s;s, but that it proceeded from her inviolable friend&s;hip, which was adequate with his, and equally wounded at their &s;eparation; and that the &s;hock was too violent for her tender nature to &s;upport. He little dream'd that Sir John had only carried off the outward frame, and that her whole &s;oul, with its deare&s;t be&s;t affections, were entirely left with him. I &s;hould have ob&s;erved that at the bot|tom of one of the pictures this lady drew of Dumont, her fond imagination had led her &s;o far as to in&s;ert tho&s;e lines with which Hamlet de&s;cribes the per&s;on of his father, <HI>viz.</HI></P>

<P>Many may be apt to think the Lady's partial fondne&s;s excited her to give this amiable de&s;cription of him without his having a real claim to it; but it is the gene|ral opinion of all who know him, to allow he does not in the lea&s;t fall &s;hort of it; nor has nature only outwardly adorn'd him, for his mind is beautiful as his per|&s;on; therefore we mu&s;t hope that all who read Mi&s;s Evelyn's &s;tory will rather pity than condemn her, as &s;he &s;o worthily be&s;tow'd her heart.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the new married pair were arrived at their &s;eat, Sir John and Mrs. Evelyn wrote to Iver, giving but a me|lancholy account of the poor lady who relap&s;ed into a &s;econd illne&s;s, which with much difficulty &s;he at la&s;t overcame.
<PB N="176" REF="186">
When &s;he was perfectly recover'd Mrs. Evelyn took her leave and return'd to Iver. The morning they came away Sir John gave his mother in law a paper &s;ealed up, which as it was the beginning of the year, he beg'd her to accept on as a New-year's gift; notwith&s;tanding the &s;mallne&s;s of the parcel, &s;he conceived it to be a valuable pre&s;ent, but never ex|amin'd the contents of it till &s;he got to Iver, which upon opening, &s;he found to be bank notes for two thou&s;and pounds; upon which &s;he wrote to her &s;on a letter of &s;incere&s;t acknowledgments; and in return he &s;ent her word he had received more than mines of wealth from her hand, for which his whole e&s;tate and life conjoin'd, could never make her a &s;uf|ficient amends.</P>
<P>Sir John and his lady, notwith&s;tanding her want of conjugal affection, lived as happy as could be po&s;&s;ibly expected; he was ever &s;tudying to ea&s;e the anxiety of mind he too plainly perceived &s;he la|bour'd under; nor was he ignorant of the cau&s;e of her melancholy; and though not po&s;itively a&s;&s;ured that Mr. Dumont was the object of her love, he &s;hrewdly
<PB N="177" REF="187" MS="Y">
&s;u&s;pected it; but as &s;he was di&s;creet enough never to mention his name, her hu&s;band was equally cautious to avoid it. He knew by him&s;elf that love was an involuntary pa&s;&s;ion, therefore could not blame her, e&s;pecially as he had in a man|ner robbed her of her&s;elf, was deter|mined to make the utmo&s;t amends within his power, by a con&s;tant endeavour to make her happy; and &s;he, on her part, &s;trove to conceal the love that labour'd in her brea&s;t by an exact complacency of temper, and a perpetual &s;pring of good nature; each thinking they had wrong'd the other, the one by forcibly marrying the Lady contrary to her will, and &s;he by allienating her heart from one, whom &s;he confe&s;&s;ed, had it not been for her love to Dumont, &s;he might have been truly happy with.</P>
<P>They lived together three years; Sir John's affection hourly encrea&s;ing was greatly augmented by the birth of a beautiful daughter, in the &s;econd year of their marriage; I mu&s;t ob&s;erve to the reader this child was the very image of Mr. Dumont, which might, in the opi|nion of the cen&s;orious, have drawn an
<PB N="178" REF="188">
imputation on the lady's character had they been together at that time; but they had not &s;een each other two years before the birth of this infant, or if they had, there was the &s;trong guard of the lady's impregnable virtue to take off an odium of that kind. But it is no wonder the child &s;hould bear &s;o &s;trong a re&s;em|blance of one who was the hourly image of the mother's thoughts. Nor did &s;he fail to indulge her eyes in often viewing the pictures &s;he had of him, which &s;he kept unknown to any one.</P>
<P>It happened one day, Sir John was obliged to attend at the a&s;&s;izes, being cho&s;e among the re&s;t of the gentlemen of the county to make up the number of the Grand jury. The county town was ten miles di&s;tant from his &s;eat, and the court &s;itting late, he would not be per|&s;waded to &s;tay all night, but excited by his fondne&s;s, re&s;olved to go home late as it was. When he came within half a mile of his own hou&s;e, his hor&s;e took fright and threw him &s;everal yards from him, which broke his arm, and brui&s;ed him inwardly in &s;o terrible a manner he
<PB N="179" REF="189" MS="Y">
was thrown into a violent fever, and ex|pired in a few days.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t tender attack he ever made on the heart of lady Generous, was at the &s;ight of him in his di&s;tre&s;s, when he was brought in by his &s;ervants; had it even been Mr. Dumont, &s;he could not have &s;hewn more tender concern; and her care of him the time he langui&s;h'd under his misfortune, greatly alleviated his pain, and convinced him of the dignity of her mind, that could &s;o patiently endure &s;uch a load of complicated woes with &s;o per|fect a re&s;ignation.</P>
<P>Some few moments before the death of this unfortunate gentleman, he de&s;ired his afflicted lady to lye by him on the bed, having &s;omething of con&s;equence to impart to her; then ordering the &s;er|vants and nur&s;e to withdraw; he thus addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf.
<Q>&startq;My heart's deare&s;t ble&s;&s;ing, I am now upon the ex|tream verge of life, therefore hope you won't be offended at what I am going to &s;ay; I know my un|bounded pa&s;&s;ion for you has been the motive of that continued melancholly and violent illne&s;s you have twice

Lady Generous intreated him to proceed no farther, unle&s;s he intended her immediate death. After having given her time to recover from the &s;urprize and agony he threw her into by the&s;e la&s;t words, he re&s;umed his di&s;|cour&s;e; a&s;&s;uring her that &s;o far from being angry, he thought him&s;elf more than much obliged to her for having &s;acrificed her own happine&s;s to e&s;tabli&s;h his.
<Q>&startq;When I am dead, which in a very &s;hort time, &s;aid he, I certainly &s;hall be; the only amends I can make you, is to intreat you to let your papa (who I am a&s;&s;ured is no &s;tranger to the tendere&s;t &s;ecrets of your &s;oul) contrive the means of a reward for all tho&s;e &s;ufferings my unhappy love has brought upon you, by a wi&s;h'd for &endq;union with his worthy friend.</Q>
His &s;peech was interrupted by a flood of tears; which when &s;he had gently wiped away with the &s;ofte&s;t tenderne&s;s, he
<PB N="181" REF="191">
beg'd her to love his little one for the &s;ake of him, who tho' in the agonizing pains of death, felt no pain equal to that of leaving her. Lady Generous had but ju&s;t life enough her&s;elf to ring the bell to order the phy&s;icians in, who were con|&s;tantly attending in the hou&s;e, but before they came up he had with a gentle &s;igh expired in her arms, fixing his fond eyes to their la&s;t beam of light upon the only object of his tend're&s;t wi&s;hes.</P>
<P>When the phy&s;icians came in and found Sir John dead, they immediately conducted the afflicted lady to another apartment; and &s;ure no per&s;on breathing ever labour'd under &s;uch accumulated griefs as poor Lady Generous! Con|&s;ider her dreadful circum&s;tance! Her poor heart long tormented with a hope|le&s;s pa&s;&s;ion for another; her grateful mind corroded with the &s;ight of her expiring hu&s;band, who doated on her even to madne&s;s; the reflection of all his &s;ufferings on her account, and his generous con&s;ignment of her even to his rival at their mournful parting, rai&s;ed &s;uch a conflict in her &s;oul, that had &s;he not been &s;trongly fortified with an un|common
<PB N="182" REF="192">
under&s;tanding, &s;he mu&s;t have con&s;equently fallen a victim to &s;uch an unrea&s;onable &s;hare of dire cala|mities.</P>
<P>The next day Sir John's will was read, which entitled his lady to the whole e&s;tate, paying out of it a fortune of ten thou&s;and pounds to little Mi&s;s when &s;he came of age; and in ca&s;e lady Generous died a widow, the whole e&s;tate to de|volve upon the child; but if otherwi&s;e, it was left to the lady and her heirs for ever. He left al&s;o two hundred a year during the lives of Mr. and Mrs. Eve|lyn, be&s;ides &s;ome trifling legacies to &s;ervants.</P>
<P>Lady Generous gave orders to her &s;teward to have Sir John interr'd with great funeral pomp, that nothing might be wanting to te&s;tify the high re&s;pect &s;he &s;hould ever pay to his memory. Accordingly he lay in &s;tate &s;ome days, and one of the fine&s;t marble monuments was erected, with his effigy at full length, and a beautiful epitaph de&s;cribing the noble character he ju&s;tly de&s;erved.</P>
<P>The &s;teward di&s;patch'd a &s;ervant with letters to the Count's family, who were

&s;en&s;ibly touched with the lo&s;s of this much valued gentleman. Mr. Evelyn went back with the me&s;&s;enger who bro't the fatal news, with a de&s;ign to have per&s;uaded the Lady to re&s;ide at Iver, in hopes of diverting her melancholly; and the rather as it might have been a means to have crown'd the end of all her wi&s;hes in Mr. Dumont.</P>
<P>When Mr. Evelyn arrived, he found his daughter, (who&s;e beauties even grief could not &s;hadow) &s;itting with her &s;weet babe, whom &s;he was alternately ki&s;&s;ing and weeping o'er: all the apartments were hung in mourning for a twelve|month, and every &s;oul in the hou&s;e, to the mo&s;t menial &s;ervant, bore an a&s;|pect of real &s;orrow for their worthy ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>Lady Generous was greatly plea&s;ed at this unexpected vi&s;it from her papa; who propo&s;ed her removing from her &s;eat, for the forementioned rea&s;ons; but, even in re&s;pect to that, &s;he di&s;covered a noblene&s;s of &s;oul, which I may venture to affirm is unprecedented; for when her father urged her probability of mar|rying Dumont, making then his know|ledge
<PB N="184" REF="194" MS="Y">
of her pa&s;&s;ion for him no longer a &s;ecret; &s;he ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed the offer, as &s;he was determined to pay the &s;tricte&s;t re&s;pect to the memory of her deceas'd hu&s;band; adding, that &s;he had been &s;o inur'd to &s;orrow, &s;he was re&s;olved to &s;ubmit to its utmo&s;t poignancy, rather than wound her fame, by flying to &s;uch a relief as mu&s;t put her in the eye of mode&s;ty, upon the level of a com|mon pro&s;titute.</P>
<P>I am apt to think, if the great exam|ple of this virtuous Lady, who&s;e love was of &s;o delicate a nature, and founded upon the mo&s;t exalted principles of truth and honour, was more univer&s;al: The Briti&s;h fair ones would &s;ecure to them|&s;elves a more la&s;ting tenderne&s;s, and high|er opinion of their under&s;tandings, than a too forward fondne&s;s can po&s;&s;ibly cre|ate in the mind of a lover or a hu&s;band.</P>
<P>Mr. Evelyn was &s;o charmed with her &s;uperiority of &s;en&s;e, he could not forbear taking her to his arms, expre&s;&s;ing his joy, by a va&s;t effu&s;ion from his eyes; after fondly embracing her, and ki&s;&s;ing with tendere&s;t affection her lovely off|&s;pring, who&s;e features bore the &s;trong

Why did you not reveal your pa&s;&s;ion to your mother, who would have &s;par'd your blu&s;hes in communicating the &s;ecret to me?

<P>No Sir, replied the Lady, notwith|&s;tanding Mr. Dumont's being dearer to me than life and its utmo&s;t happine&s;s, I re&s;olved never to make the lea&s;t di&s;co|very of my inclination, unle&s;s his heart had been equally &s;ubdued. I found a &s;ecret charm in his conver&s;ation, and the extreme&s;t plea&s;ure of my life was to behold him. As he was di&s;en|gaged, I thought it a &s;ufficient tran&s;port
<PB N="186" REF="196">
to know I had no rival to kill my hopes; therefore patiently endured the pains I &s;uffered from uncertainty, and thought it a &s;weet reward, to have hourly in view the dear delightful object of my love.</P>
<P>But, Sir, (continued &s;he) I entreat we may drop the &s;ubject, which now ill &s;uits the decency required in my pre&s;ent circum&s;tance. Sir John, whom I lament as a mo&s;t valuable friend, mu&s;t now en|gro&s;s my thoughts; and though my di&s;|tracted mind, and tortur'd heart, could not make him the &s;oft returns of love his fondne&s;s be&s;towed on me; I &s;hall, how|ever, even to a religious &s;en&s;e of ten|derne&s;s, pay that grateful tribute to his memory, his hone&s;t &s;oul de&s;erves, and ju&s;tly claims.</P>
<P>Her father could not but approve of her conduct, yet &s;till was anxious for her welfare, and feared her devoting her&s;elf to &s;uch continued melancholly would &s;oon deprive him of her; there|fore re&s;olved, in hopes to &s;often and a&s;|&s;wage her grief, to &s;tay with her the winter; but was prevented by an expre&s;s from Mr. Dumont, to inform him his

Grandpapa was taken dangerou&s;ly ill, and begged him to return with the ut|mo&s;t ha&s;te.</P>
<P>This was another cruel &s;troke of fate to poor Lady Generous; who upon hear|ing the news, &s;aid, &s;he began to imagine that Heaven had marked her out to bear ince&s;&s;ant and multiplied afflictions. Then &s;ighing, cried, be it &s;o! Who dare di&s;|pute the Power Omnipotent? and &s;ince I'm born to &s;truggle with misfortunes, let meeke&s;t patience guide me thro' the dreadful maze of never cea&s;ing woe!</P>
<P>Her father was in the utmo&s;t di&s;tre&s;s at leaving her, but &s;he knew he was compelled by the &s;tronge&s;t bonds of af|fection, gratitude, and honour; and ear|ly next morning he took a melancholly farewel of her and his beloved grand|child, to pay his la&s;t duty as it proved to his noble friend.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XII. The <HI>Count's</HI> Death. His Interment in <HI>France</HI>. Mr. <HI>Dumont</HI> meets with Mi&s;s <HI>Le Roy</HI> and her Bro|ther at <HI>Dover</HI>.

<P>MR. Evelyn's great regard, and high concern, gave wings to his eager expedition; and in le&s;s time than could be expected, he reached Iver, to the great &s;urprize of the whole family. When he &s;aw the terrible alteration which the death dealing hand of time had &s;tamp|ed in every feature of the Count, he was forced to withdraw to give vent to un|utterable grief.</P>
<P>Mr. Dumont and Mrs. Evelyn, who were con&s;tant in their attendance, per|ceiving by Mr. Evelyn's grief and con|fu&s;ion when he left the room, that he
<PB N="189" REF="199">
apprehended the Count's di&s;&s;olution was near at hand; they underwent an addi|tional weight of &s;orrow, having till then flattered them&s;elves with &s;ome hopes of his recovery.</P>
<P>The good Count mi&s;&s;ing his dear friend, lifting up his feeble eyes in &s;earch of him; told his grand&s;on, he appre|hended that his approaching fate was more than his hone&s;t tender heart could bear; therefore I won't recall him, till he finds him&s;elf capable of a voluntary return.</P>
<P>In the mean time, continued he, my deare&s;t Harry, let me employ my late&s;t moments in comforting thy grief|&s;woln heart; con&s;ider, my child, how wonderfully in thy favour, Providence has ble&s;t me with length of days to &s;ee thee, (at lea&s;t I fondly think &s;o) the wonder of the world! and of an age to guard thy&s;elf with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of thy virtues again&s;t any temptation that might lure thee to the mo&s;t trifling fall of honour. Think of my departure, but as being ap|pointed as thy careful purveyor on a journey thou mu&s;t hereafter take; where we &s;hall meet in joy never to be &s;eparated more.</P>
<P><PB N="190" REF="200" MS="Y">Mr. Dumont's filial &s;orrow grew al|mo&s;t in&s;upportable; which the Count tried to a&s;&s;wage, by telling him 'twas an offence to Heaven, to let contending grief o'er-&s;way his rea&s;on; that as it had &s;pared him to a good old age, he &s;hould reflect how much he was obliged to the Power Divine, which might have cut his thread of life e'er half tho&s;e years were fini&s;hed; that he was now kindly invited to everla&s;ting peace, and a ce&s;&s;a|tion from &s;uch pains his nature's &s;trength could no longer bear.</P>
<P>Mr. Evelyn by this time was returned, whom the worthy Count entreated with the re&s;t of his family, to join with him in prayer; which as often as his weak condition would permit, they did mo&s;t fervently. His &s;en&s;es continuing to the la&s;t; between the hours of one and two in the morning, with a &s;miling a&s;pect, and gentle &s;igh, he re&s;igned his noble &s;oul into the All Powerful Hand that gave it. Thus ended the life of the worthie&s;t gentle|man that e'er adorn'd a court, or graced the mo&s;t exalted titles of nobility.</P>
<P>The general grief that diffu&s;ed it&s;elf on this melancholly occa&s;ion is not dif|ficult
<PB N="191" REF="201">
to conceive, that I &s;hall not tire the reader's patience with a de&s;cription of it, as a lively imagination can &s;o ea&s;ily paint it in its utmo&s;t di&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>The Count ordered by his will to have his body depo&s;ited in France, and placed in the vault as near as po&s;&s;ible to the remains of Mr. Dumont and Lady Charlotte.</P>
<P>His fortune he bequeathed to his well beloved grand&s;on, and three hundred pound per Annum, to Mr. and Mrs. Evelyn, during their lives. Al&s;o lega|cies to &s;ervants.</P>
<P>His Lord&s;hip after his embalment, was conveyed to the &s;eat of eternal re&s;t with his ance&s;tors, attended by the fami|ly in general.</P>
<P>After &s;ome time, when Mr Dumont's &s;orrow was in &s;ome mea&s;ure allayed, by Mr. Evelyn's advice, he made a tour through France and Italy; then returned again to France, to &s;ettle &s;ome affairs re|lative to two va&s;t e&s;tates, which devolved to him on the death of his Grandpapa, and tho&s;e he was entitled to in the right of his father; all which, made him ma|&s;ter of full eighteen thou&s;and pounds a year.</P>

<P><PB N="192" REF="204" MS="Y">When his bu&s;ine&s;s was accompli&s;h'd he embark'd for England and landed at Dover, where he happened at the inn to fall into the company of Mi&s;s Le Roy, and her brother, who had been over to Paris to &s;ell an e&s;tate they had left them by an uncle, which was divided equally between them.</P>
<P>This lady and her brother were of French extraction, but Engli&s;h born, and had been each po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of very fine fortunes; but from an in&s;atiable fond|ne&s;s for gaming, they had reduced them|&s;elves to a nece&s;&s;ity of jointly con&s;enting to part from the foremention'd e&s;tate, not &s;o much for a needful &s;upport, as to &s;upply that avaricious folly, and I may &s;ay, ba&s;ene&s;s of mind, which had been the fatal cau&s;e of their undoing. Mi&s;s Le Roy was as &s;plendidly dre&s;s'd as a rich riding habit could po&s;&s;ibly ad|mit of. She was a tall graceful figure, and perfectly genteel; I can't &s;ay &s;he was to compare in beauty with Lady Generous, but there was an attractive je ne quoy in her a&s;pect that is equally &s;ure of captivating the heart; which &s;he fail'd not to do even to a di&s;tracted
<PB N="193" REF="205">
fondne&s;s, that of poor Mr. Dumont; nor was the young Lady unaffected with the noblene&s;s of his form; but the ha|zard and card tables, which were mo&s;t formidable rivals, would not give way to the &s;ofter pa&s;&s;ion of love, &s;o far as to &s;uffer her to know the terrible anxi|eties Lady Generous had felt on that account; yet notwith&s;tanding &s;he &s;oon found he had a very particular intere&s;t in her heart, and as he clo&s;ely pur&s;ued her, re&s;olved as &s;oon as they got to Lon|don, to give con&s;ent to marry him, which &s;he never promi&s;ed till then, ha|ving &s;en&s;e enough to &s;ecure her conque&s;t, by not being over forward.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Le Roy having an acquaintance who was newly married at Canterbury, &s;he &s;taid a week there to pay her re|&s;pects to her friend. Mr. Dumont went to the King's-Head with his whole family, nor was all the eloquence and rhetorick Mr. Evelyn was ma&s;ter of &s;uf|ficiently powerful to move him, till Mi&s;s Le Roy left the place.</P>
<P>This worthy gentleman fore&s;eeing that Mr. Dumont was unhappily $allen into a dreadful &s;nare, and from which he
<PB N="194" REF="206">
fear'd it was impo&s;&s;ible to redeem him, grew exce&s;&s;ively unea&s;y, &s;etting before him the terrible hazards a man ran who enter'd into an alliance with a woman &s;o devoted to gaming, that the be&s;t e&s;tate in the kingdom might be ruin'd from the re&s;ult of that dete&s;t|able vice, and in plain terms, told him, he &s;aw his ruin They prolong'd their &s;tay about ten days, during which time Mr. Dumont and Mr. Evelyn were equally a&s;&s;iduous, the one in pur&s;uit of his love, and the other no le&s;s &s;o in trying to di&s;&s;uade him from what he afterwards had very powerful rea&s;ons to repent.</P>
<P>This unfortunate affair occa&s;ion'd a great coldne&s;s between the&s;e two gen|tlemen; in &s;hort, the debate between them aro&s;e to &s;uch a height, that Mr. Dumont po&s;itively affirm'd to Mr. Eve|lyn, all arguments in oppo&s;ition to his de&s;ign of marrying Mi&s;s Le Roy were fruitle&s;s, and (as he through his impa|tience plea&s;ed to add) impertinent; this was a &s;tyle Mr. Evelyn never had been treated with from Mr. Dumont, and indeed a method of di&s;cour&s;e the young

gentleman had never been before u&s;ed to, even to the lowe&s;t of his dome&s;ticks; as his tutor was the fir&s;t in&s;tance of his deviating from that nice decorum he had bred him up to, it &s;truck deeply to his heart, as he regarded him not only as his pupil, but with the fond eye of a tender parent. In the heat of their debate Mr. Dumont told Mr. Eve|lyn he thought he was of an age capable to judge for him&s;elf without any inter|po&s;ition, and as he was his own ma&s;ter he &s;hould act agreeable to the dictates of his will. His good friend a&s;&s;ured him he would never more trouble him with his advice, &s;ince he found his fondne&s;s met with &s;uch ungrateful re|turns, and apparent contempt; but in|&s;i&s;ted upon his gro&s;ly mi&s;taking his being ma&s;ter of him&s;elf, while he &s;ubmitted to the &s;lavery of unrea&s;onable and ungo|vernable pa&s;&s;ions. Then left the room with a di&s;order'd ha&s;te, and flew for relief to his faithful &s;pou&s;e, who&s;e &s;weetne&s;s of temper, conjoin'd with her incomparable under&s;tanding, was ever ready to &s;often all his cares; and in order to mitigate the pain he &s;uf|fer'd

from Mr. Dumont's unexpected abruptne&s;s (being fully and &s;orrowfully convinced of his intention to undo him|&s;elf) per&s;waded him to avoid the pain of being witne&s;s of his ruin, by going down to Northumberland, and pa&s;&s;ing their remaining life with their much-valued and beloved child.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as they went to London Mr. Evelyn took a painful leave of his unhappy friend, for &s;uch he deem'd him; and &s;ettled with Lady Generous, who&s;e melancholly was in a great mea|&s;ure relieved by the tender and agree|able conver&s;ation of her fond parents, who made it their continual &s;tudy to &s;weeten that life which unprecedented woes had long embitter'd.</P>
<P>The &s;urprizing change of Mr. Du|mont's behaviour to Mr. Evelyn, which nothing but his fatal love could have oc|ca&s;ion'd, gave the worthy gentleman an unea&s;ine&s;s he never felt before, and &s;uch as he never truly overcame. When they parted it was but with a bare civility on both &s;ides; but on Mr. Evelyn's part with a &s;ecret grief, fore|&s;eeing the &s;ad con&s;equences attending

<P>This young Lady having &s;een a great deal of the world, had art enough to deal with it, as every one ought to do who have a de&s;ign to thrive in it; and had it not been for her fond|ne&s;s for play, the match would not have been altogether &s;o very unrea&s;o|nable, as &s;he was de&s;cended from very good families, her mother being daugh|ter to a peer of Great-Britain, and her father a gentleman employ'd in con&s;i|derable po&s;ts of honour under the go|vernment; by which he &s;aved hand&s;ome fortunes for his &s;on and daughter, which they were &s;oon &s;trip'd of from the foremention'd vice; that &s;o &s;hame|fully predominated over their hearts, from ten thou&s;and pounds a piece, in le&s;s than three years they were not worth a &s;hilling. They were then obliged to pur&s;ue this egregious folly as a bu&s;ine&s;s for their &s;upport; and before Mi&s;s was married, &s;he play'd away not only the trifling remains of fortune ari&s;ing from the little e&s;tate &s;he had &s;old, but her very watch and jewels, all which Mr.

Dumont was witne&s;s of; yet his un|limited pa&s;&s;ion could take no warning from the &s;ad &s;pecimen &s;he gave of what he was hereafter to expect, and too &s;urely &s;uffer'd: nor was that fond|ne&s;s for this dreadful motive of ruin confined alone to her; the infection caught poor Mr. Dumont, and as it is natural to imitate the actions of tho&s;e we love, he gave demon&s;trative proofs of his regard, by &s;uffering this con|tagion to poi&s;on the health of rea&s;on and reflection, which till then had ever been the happy ornaments of his well-conducted life.</P>
<P>When Mi&s;s was thoroughly convinced &s;he was undone, and perfectly a&s;&s;ured of her power over her thoughtle&s;s lover, &s;he thought it high time to look about her, as creditors began to grow pre&s;&s;ing; and &s;he and her brother being equally $igent, &s;he re&s;olved to make a me|$it of nece&s;&s;ity; and upon Mr. Du|mont's next entreaty, con&s;ented to name what he then thought the day of his happine&s;s; in pur&s;uance of which, new coach and liveries, with an additional train of &s;ervants, were immediately or|der'd;

a &s;et of dre&s;&s;ing plate for the lady of two thou&s;and pounds value; jewels innumerable, and rich cloaths to the amount of many thou&s;ands more, were provided for the bride; and the wedding &s;olemnized with extravagant and &s;uperfluous &s;plendour.</P>
<P>Poor Mr. Dumont, who was blinded by the violence of love, conceived him&s;elf the happie&s;t of mankind; in &s;hort, his boundle&s;s pa&s;&s;ion led him into a thou&s;and needle&s;s follies to plea&s;e and &s;upport his Lady's vanity. She &s;oon e&s;tabli&s;h'd a private a&s;&s;embly for play at her own hou&s;e, and was never mi&s;&s;ing at all publick diver&s;ions.</P>
<P>Her brother, who by the bye, was &s;wingingly in debt, and who had ra|ther more cunning than real &s;en&s;e, un|known to his &s;i&s;ter, contrived with his creditors to enter into a general de|&s;ign to arre&s;t him; which in about two months after the wedding was over, as he was &s;tepping into the coach, with his brother in law, according to his own appointment and expectation, he was laid hold on for two hundred pounds; upon which Mr. Dumont,
<PB N="200" REF="212">
with his accu&s;tom'd good nature, re|turned with him and the officers into the hou&s;e, and immediately di&s;charged the debt. The next day he had or|der'd another &s;et of bailiffs to look out for him at White's chocolate-hou&s;e, where he re&s;olved to go for that pur|po&s;e; &s;o only writing a line to his &s;i&s;ter, to excu&s;e his being &s;o &s;uddenly trouble&s;ome a &s;econd time, another debt of a hundred pound more was ac|quitted; in this manner he proceeded to get him&s;elf clear of all incumbrances, pre&s;uming upon his brother in law's uncommon fondne&s;s for his &s;i&s;ter, to make him the dupe to his villainous impo&s;itions.</P>
<P>Mrs. Dumont, who was too &s;en&s;ible of her brother's di&s;regard to any points of honour, &s;ecretly rebuked him for this mean artifice, which with all his contrivance he had not cunning enough to conceal; but that he might never more become burden&s;ome to her hu&s;band &s;he prevail'd on him to purcha&s;e him a commi&s;&s;ion, only propo&s;ing his ha|ving a pair of colours in the guards; but the too generous Dumont changed

<P>As &s;oon as this new officer was e&s;tabli&s;h'd, he went down into Wilt|&s;hire to a famous cloathing town, call'd Bradford, to join the troop, which then was under his command. What hap|pen'd to him afterwards we &s;hall here|after treat of, and return to Mr. Dumont and his Lady.</P>
<P>This unfortunate pair by that time they had been married two years, had through lo&s;&s;es at play, and unbounded extravagancies in living, reduced the eighteen thou&s;and per annum mo&s;t &s;hame|fully; nor was it to be wonder'd at, when neither of them ever &s;et le&s;s upon a card than a hundred guineas, half that &s;um they only call'd piddling with; and as if fate de&s;ign'd to puni&s;h them for their vice, they generally lo&s;t ten times to once winning.</P>

They &s;oon entered into a con|ver&s;ation, which confirm'd the report Mr. Evelyn had given Powel of the excellent character of Mr. Jennings, nor was he a little plea&s;ed to hear it, on his own cccount, as Mr. Jennings

<P>Mrs. Jennings &s;oon appear'd, con|ducted by her &s;on. Mr. Jennings in|troduced Mr. Powel to this agreeable lady; who going to &s;alute her, they &s;tarted, and fix'd in a&s;toni&s;hment, gazed at each other, expre&s;&s;ing by their looks an unu&s;ual joy at the interview.</P>

having once &s;een the lea&s;t familiarity from his wife to any man but him&s;elf, and very gravely a&s;k'd Mr. Powel how long he had been acquainted with Mrs. Jennings? Oh Sir, replied Mr. Powel, from infancy, and our loves increa&s;ed with our years. Ala&s;s I thought her dead, but how &s;hall I expre&s;s my over|flow of happine&s;s in &s;eeing her, after &s;o many baleful hours of angui&s;h I have felt on her account, lea&s;t fate might have inflicted mi&s;eries on her, as it has lately mo&s;t &s;everely done on me.</P>
<P>Mr. Jennings could not very well tell what to make of all this, till Mr. Powel call'd her &s;i&s;ter; upon which Mr. Jennings embraced him with a fraternal tenderne&s;s, and was overjoy'd that Providence had &s;o fortunately put it in his power to give fre&s;h proofs of his fondne&s;s to Mrs. Jennings, by paying all due regard to the per&s;on and intere&s;t of &s;o near a relation.</P>
<P>An apartment was immediately or|der'd for Mr. Powel and family in Mr. Jennings's own hou&s;e till a proper &s;ettlement could be found for him, which
<PB N="213" REF="221" MS="Y">
was &s;oon after accompli&s;h'd; it hap|pening that a factor died in a &s;hort time after, and he was &s;ettled by his brother in law in the hou&s;e of the de|cea&s;ed, and by a large pre&s;ent from him, enabled him to carry on the bu|&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>Mr. Powel was very de&s;irous to &s;ee his younge&s;t &s;i&s;ter, whom he under|&s;tood by Mr. Ledger was married the day before. Mr. Jennings, though he was but ju&s;t come from the new mar|ried pair, would not protract the bro|ther's joy of &s;eeing his other &s;i&s;ter, and made a journey for that purpo&s;e the next day, to vi&s;it Mrs. Leice&s;ter who had married an Engli&s;h gentleman, that had re&s;ided but a very few years in that country, but by an indu&s;trious improve|ment of a little fortune, and gaining by his behaviour an univer&s;al e&s;teem, made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of ten thou&s;and pounds.</P>
<P>Mrs. Leice&s;ter was no le&s;s plea&s;ed at the unexpected &s;ight of her brother, than Mrs. Jennings had been; but now rea|der judge the &s;trong confu&s;ion and &s;urprize both of Mr. Powel and Mr. Lei|ce&s;ter,
<PB N="214" REF="222">
who proved to be the very man that had defrauded him of the 400 <HI>l.</HI> and was the cruel author of all poor Powel's &s;ufferings; the money he rob|bed him of was the means of his ad|vancement in the Indies, whil&s;t the other was pining with famine and de|&s;pair in a loath&s;ome jail in England.</P>
<P>When the&s;e two per&s;ons met they both changed countenance, Powel with rage, redned and darted his eyes like an offended tyger, while the other turn|ed pale, from the re&s;ult of con&s;cious guilt, and who&s;e whole ma&s;s of blood retreated to his heart, both remain|ing &s;peechle&s;s and immoveable. This vi&s;ible confu&s;ion put all the company in a mo&s;t profound con&s;ternation. Mr. Jennings a&s;king Mrs. Powel if &s;he could explain this riddle, &s;he told him yes; by which time Mr. Powel who perceived her to be going to open the affair, prevented her, by winking at her, re&s;olving within him&s;elf to take different mea&s;ures in the conduct of this bu&s;ine&s;s than what Leice&s;ter expect|ed he would have done, who from the &s;trong impul&s;e of &s;hame, &s;urprize, and

angui&s;h of mind, fainted quite away, which gave a general concern to all, but mo&s;t e&s;pecially the bride, who threw her&s;elf pro&s;trate on her hu&s;band, con|cluding him to be gone for ever; but by proper a&s;&s;i&s;tance he recover'd, and de&s;ired for a few moments to be left alone with Mr. Powel.</P>
<P>Mr. Jennings at this reque&s;t took all the company into the garden, who remain'd in &s;trange confu&s;ion; the ladies mo&s;t e&s;pecially were curious to know, and began to que&s;tion Mrs. Powel, as they fear'd &s;omething wrong on Mr. Leice&s;ter's part; but her hu&s;band's hint was a &s;ufficient excu&s;e for her decli|ning to give the lea&s;t account; nor would Mr. Jennings permit them to make any farther enquiry.

I know my&s;elf in your power, nor &s;hall I intreat you to foregoe a proper and ju&s;tifiable u&s;e of it on my own ac|count, but to avoid the agonizing grief your &s;i&s;ter (whom more than life I love) mu&s;t con&s;equently feel on a publick proce&s;s again&s;t me.

And now Mr. Liece&s;ter let us embrace as friends and brothers, and when you are at lei&s;ure let me know (for I am certain you are a gentleman) what induced you to throw &s;o apparent a blemi&s;h on that character.

expo&s;ed to the bitterne&s;s of want in a pri&s;on, and that his wife and chil|dren had been in a peri&s;hing condi|tion; he was &s;o dreadfully &s;hock'd at the recital, he wanted power to expre&s;s the tender concern he felt on that ac|count, but &s;hew'd it by pre&s;&s;ing his brother clo&s;e to his bo&s;om, and vented his &s;orrow and contrition by a very hearty flood of penitential tears.</P>

<P>Mr. Powel, to &s;top any further en|quiry, told Mr. Jennings that Mr. Lei|ce&s;ter had formerly u&s;ed him ill in an affair of very great con&s;equence, by witholding from him a con&s;iderable &s;um, which had expo&s;ed him even to want

and a pri&s;on; and knowing Mr. Lei|ce&s;ter founded his fortune on his ruin, &s;eeing him &s;o unexpected and unpre|pared, threw him&s;elf into a rage, which he begg'd Mr. Jennings's pardon for, telling him the matter was entirely made up by an ample amends from his brother in law; and that all that was pa&s;t &s;hould be forgot on his &s;ide, expre&s;&s;ing an earne&s;t de&s;ire to live in a la&s;ting friend&s;hip with him, as a brother and a friend.</P>
<P>Mr. Jennings was highly plea&s;ed to find the matter was accommodated, and went to fetch the ladies, who were equally delighted on that account; when the two brothers in law were left alone the &s;econd time, Mr. Lie|ce&s;ter took that opportunity to expre&s;s how much he thought him&s;elf obliged to Mr. Powel's uncommon genero&s;ity, and promi&s;ed to give him every con|vincing proof by promoting his intere&s;t, and which he forwarded with the ut|mo&s;t expedition, making him, thro' his means, in two years time, a five thou&s;and pound man, clear of all in|cumbrances.

<P>MR. Jennings, and Mr. Leice&s;ter &s;pared neither pains nor co&s;t to effect Mr. Powel's bu&s;ine&s;s, in a very &s;hort time; the former excited to it from the recommendation of Mr. Eve|lyn, as well as from the regard he had to him from being his brother in law; and the other impell'd by a &s;trong de|&s;ire to make him the utmo&s;t amends within his power; for the foremention'd rea&s;ons, Mr. Powel very &s;oon became a man of note in the place, and in|&s;tructed by his brother Jennings, who was one of the greate&s;t and riche&s;t mer|chants there, he made &s;o con&s;iderable
<PB N="222" REF="230">
a progre&s;s, that he was worth &s;everal thou&s;and pounds in a few years.</P>
<P>One day, as Mr. Leice&s;ter and he were walking in a grove, that belonged to Powel's e&s;tate, he reminded him of the promi&s;e he made him of his hi&s;tory, which the other began as follows.</P>
<P>You may remember, &s;aid Leice&s;ter, that I told you I was at law for an e&s;tate of five hundred a year; 'tis true I was, but I was at that time defending a very bad cau&s;e, for I had taken po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of my mother's jointure, which fell to my elder brother by her death, while he was in the Ea&s;t Indies; and by an extravagant cour&s;e of life, had a great deal impair'd it, mortgaging &s;ome of the land belonging thereto; and had he not come over as he did, 'tis po&s;&s;ible from the riotous life I led, devoting my&s;elf too much to the ladies and the bottle, the whole might have been e|qually incumbred. I took care not to let him know my mother was dead, nor did he ever get the lea&s;t information of it, till he came to England; at which time, finding me ob&s;tinately, and I may &s;ay in&s;olently re&s;olved, to withold his
<PB N="223" REF="231">
right from him, he commenced a law-&s;uit in which I was &s;oon ca&s;t&punc; and having run thro' the fortune my father bequeath'd me five years before, I was drove to my wits end to know which way I was to &s;ub&s;i&s;t; never having been bred to any bu&s;ine&s;s, and acquiring an idle way of thinking from the ill examples of my a&s;&s;ociates, I ran very much in debt, and at the time I &s;o &s;hamefully and cruelly wrong'd your friend&s;hip, I was under an arre&s;t for two hundred and fifty pounds, but by virtue of the la&s;t five guineas I was ma&s;ter of, the officer &s;et me at large for two days; and knowing a pri&s;on for life, mu&s;t have been the con&s;equence of my &s;urrendring, I emboldened my &s;pirits with drinking, to perpetrate the horrid de&s;ign I put in force again&s;t you and your unhappy family; paid the debt, and went on board an India-man with the remaining part of the ca&s;h, without con&s;idering what I &s;hould do when I arrived here; till luckily fal|ling into the worthy acquaintance of Mr. Jennings, who&s;e powerful exam|ples of honour and virtue made &s;uch
<PB N="224" REF="232">
an impre&s;&s;ion on my mind, I was de|termined no longer to pur&s;ue the tract of villainy; and heartily repenting of my crime, I found the &s;uperior force of innocence hourly gaining ground; and what con&s;iderably added to my conver&s;ion, was the conception of the mo&s;t tender and honourable pa&s;&s;ion for my deare&s;t Harriot; whom more than life I love. Her amiable di&s;po|&s;ition &s;oftened me into every noble &s;en|timent of honour &s;upported with hu|manity; and &s;et my pa&s;t crimes before me in &s;o ju&s;t a light, as made me hate the reflection of my guilt, and fixed me everla&s;tingly a friend to virtue.</P>
<P>The only torment of my life, was the dreadful imagination of what you &s;uffered; but the terror of my guilt being di&s;clo&s;ed, by advertizing where I was, and the uncertainty of your not taking a ju&s;t revenge, made me foregoe any de&s;ign of enquiring after you. And had not providence &s;o happily ca&s;t you on our &s;hore, that circum|&s;tance mu&s;t &s;till have embittered the &s;weets of life; which through Hea|ven's and your forgivene&s;s, I hope
<PB N="225" REF="233">
we &s;hall ever enjoy. And be a&s;&s;ured, my dear friend and brother, I look upon no part of my e&s;tate my own, when ever your intere&s;t demands it.</P>
<P>Mr. Powel's good nature had long &s;ince forgiven the injury, and as a convincing proof that he de&s;ired al&s;o to forget it, he enjoined his brother never more to give the lea&s;t hint of what had pa&s;&s;ed; declaring, that he was made ample amends in the won|drous turns of providence on his &s;ide, and received an additional and un|&s;peakable happine&s;s in Mr. Leice&s;ter's conver&s;ion.</P>
<P>It happened that one of the riche&s;t black planters died, who leaving only a widow behind him, and &s;he being advanced in years, re&s;olved to &s;ell the plantation and a numerous &s;tock of &s;laves, and retire from bu&s;ine&s;s. Accordingly a &s;ale was adverti&s;ed, and among the re&s;t of the gentlemen, Mr. Jennings, Mr. Leice&s;ter, and Mr. Powel, went to make purcha&s;es of the goods; as to &s;laves, Mr. Jennings ne|ver would deal that way, being of too tender a di&s;po&s;ition to inflict the
<PB N="226" REF="234">
heavy grievances and burdens lie often &s;aw his fellow creatures un|dergoe. However, he went into the gardens with the re&s;t of the company, where the&s;e unhappy wretches were employed in dreadful ta&s;ks in the ex|tremity of the &s;ultry heat, frequently receiving cruel &s;tripes from the mer|cile&s;s hands of their over&s;eers.</P>
<P>But what mu&s;t be his confu&s;ion and &s;urprize, when among the number of the&s;e mi&s;erable objects, he &s;aw his own uncle, who had formerly abandon|ed him to the utmo&s;t wretchedne&s;s, had not Providence &s;ent young Du|mont to his relief. Yet notwith&s;tand|ing his barbarity, Mr. Jennings felt all the tender emotions of heart for his misfortune, as if he had never wronged him; and immediately en|quired into the cau&s;e of his arrival there, not owning him farther than one he had &s;een in England, and was &s;orry for his unhappy mi&s;-manage|ment, which had reduced the laws to a nece&s;&s;ity of expo&s;ing his age, (he being pretty elderly) to &s;uch hard|&s;hips.</P>
<P><PB N="227" REF="235">When he came to &s;peak to him, Mr. Jennings found he had entirely out|grown his knowledge; nor did he in|tend to reveal him&s;elf, till upon que|&s;tioning him, he found he was likely ever to be worthy of &s;uch a di&s;co|very.</P>
<P>When this worthy gentleman ac|co&s;ted him, his humanity was &s;o touched, he had &s;carce power to &s;peak; nor was his hone&s;t &s;oul le&s;s affected with inward &s;hame, to think that a|ny one &s;o nearly related to him, was capable of de&s;erving &s;uch a puni&s;h|ment. But when he was informed the cau&s;e proceeded from his attempt to rob the late noble and illu&s;trious Count De&s;trades; his grief and confu&s;ion was not to be de&s;cribed; nor could he bear the reflection of an injury intended from any part of his fami|ly to his worthy benefactor. And in a letter to Mr. Evelyn, which he &s;ent &s;oon after on that occa&s;ion, he &s;uffi|ciently te&s;tified the concern he felt on that account; however, he had the &s;atisfaction of letting him know at the &s;ame time, that upon his di&s;cover|ing

him&s;elf to his uncle; (whom he had purcha&s;ed from the widow) it had &s;o happy an effect on the old man, that he grew penitent; and from Mr. Jennings's generous u&s;age, (from whom he had no right to ex|pect the lea&s;t glimmering hope of mercy) he became the rever&s;e of what he had been; confe&s;&s;ing his crimes, with an utter abhorrence of the re|membrance of 'em, and in the hum|ble&s;t manner implored his nephew's pardon; who not only gave him his freedom, but &s;ettled him &s;ome few miles di&s;tant from him. He lived two years only, leading a life of contri|tion, and died a perfect convert to religion's truth and pure&s;t laws.</P>

<P>MR. Evelyn was extreamly pleas'd at the account Mr. Jennings gave of the happy i&s;&s;ue of his uncle's affair, and highly applauded his forgiving nature, and godlike di&s;po&s;ition; Lady Generous and Mrs. Evelyn were equally delighted with the virtues of this worthy gentle|man, nor could they refrain from tears, when they reflected on his &s;ufferings in regard to his pa&s;&s;ion for Lady Gene|rous; who &s;trongly &s;ympathized with him in the pains &s;he endured from her fondne&s;s of young Dumont.</P>
<P>Mr. Evelyn an&s;wer'd his letter, with fre&s;h a&s;&s;urances of the &s;incere&s;t friend&s;hip, and hearty congratulation for his &s;ucce&s;s in merchandize; he had &s;carce fini&s;h'd Mr. Jennings's epi&s;tle, before the po&s;t &s;topt at the gate, with one from Mr.

Allworth, who was the gentleman Mr. Evelyn enjoyn'd to have a watchful eye upon Mr. Dumont, and notwith&s;tanding the coldne&s;s ari&s;ing from Dumont's un|expected turn of behaviour, he could not help feeling the &s;ecret tenderne&s;s which offended parents often do, when head|&s;trong children precipitately ru&s;h into follies which not only de&s;troy their own happine&s;s, but terribly corrode that of the afflicted father and &s;uffering mo|ther.</P>
<P>Such was the ca&s;e with Mr. Evelyn, who having been acquainted in his youth with Mr. Allworth, and proved him to be a gentleman of honour and &s;tricte&s;t integrity, he depended on his friendly and &s;ecret corre&s;pondence to inform him of every unhappy &s;tep he fore&s;aw Mr. Dumont was going to take.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t beg leave to let the reader know, that Mr. Allworth was a Gentle|man of an ancient family, but being a younger brother, his father had it only in his power to leave him 2000l. which with difficulty he had &s;craped toge|ther for him; this gentleman had a libe|ral education, and nature having fur|ni&s;hed

him with &s;ound judgment and &s;prightly wit, he was univer&s;ally ad|mired and care&s;&s;ed, which led him into a general acquaintance with all the po|lite and &s;en&s;ible part of the town; and happy were they, who could fir&s;t &s;e|cure him for all parties of plea&s;ure. Being perfectly well bred, and ever|la&s;tingly good humour'd, he wi&s;ely con|&s;idered that the &s;mallne&s;s of his income, was inferior to the dignity of his edu|cation; and as he was above the mean|ne&s;s of being a fortune hunter, remain'd a batchelor, nor would he &s;toop to marry any one below him in birth, and help to people the world with genteel beg|gars.</P>
<P>This re&s;olution empowered him to live ea&s;y to him&s;elf, and ever agree|able to his friends; among whom was the Count De&s;trades, having been in|troduced by Mr. Evelyn there a few months before that nobleman's decea&s;e; in conformity to Mr. Evelyn's reque&s;t, he &s;ent the following account of Mr. Dumont.</P>

Believe me, dear &s;ir, 'tis with a&s;toni&s;h|ment I behold a daily concour&s;e of people a&s;&s;emble them&s;elves with a pre|meditated de&s;ign, like &s;o many Savages to prey upon one another; yet &s;hake hands, and embrace, call each other friend, when at the &s;ame time, they meet with a barbarous intent of robbing each other of the means of life; which I think falls but one &s;tep &s;hort of a deva&s;tation

<P>Mr. Allworth was highly delighted at the thoughts of &s;eeing his worthy friend again, and more e&s;pecially &s;o, as it was likely to be the happy means of pre|venting the total ruin of this unfor|tunate gentleman. But alas! his lady
<PB N="241" REF="249" MS="Y">
ran to &s;uch exce&s;&s;es, that before Mr. Evelyn could po&s;&s;ibly take his intend|ed journey, he was ab&s;olutely undone. At the very la&s;t a&s;&s;embly that was held at his hou&s;e, there came in two well dre&s;s'd &s;trangers, whom Mr. All|worth took but little notice of, and as Mr. Dumont, to oblige his lady, had made it a general rule to enter|tain any per&s;on who made a genteel appearance, they were permitted to play, and in le&s;s than three hours, made them&s;elves ma&s;ters of every &s;hil|ling he was worth in the world. Mrs. Dumont continued playing till &s;he had &s;trip'd her&s;elf of her watch and jewels, with the hopes of redeeming all again, but in vain! All was lo&s;t, and they were obliged next day to quit the hou&s;e, and by virtue of the writings of the e&s;tate deliver'd by Mr. Dumont, the&s;e two per&s;ons took immediate po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion. Mr. Allworth's humanity pro|vided Mr. Dumont an apartment, and &s;upplied him with ca&s;h, as far as his circum&s;tances would admit; but Mrs. Dumont, from the &s;hock of this dreadful cata&s;trophe, took &s;o immoderately to
<PB N="242" REF="250">
drinking, that in about three months time &s;he died raving mad.</P>
<P>Poor Mrs. Evelyn at that time fell into a violent fever, which retarded their journey till her death; which misfortune made her di&s;con&s;olate hu&s;band per&s;i&s;t more &s;trenuou&s;ly for his daughter's coming to London, not being able to bear the place where he had &s;u&s;tain'd &s;uch a real lo&s;s. Lady Generous was not le&s;s concern'd, and readily obey'd her father's will, &s;etting forward with the utmo&s;t expedition, after her dear mo|ther's interment.</P>
<P>Mr. Dumont, notwith&s;tanding he owed his ruin to his wife, was mo&s;t ten|derly affected at her decea&s;e; and for &s;ome time, from the reflection of the unhappy mi&s;conduct on both &s;ides, fell into a deep melancholy, and as a farther addi|tion to his di&s;tre&s;s, he received news of his brother-in-law (who was ever a di&s;affected per&s;on) having joined the rebels, &s;uf|fer'd a publick ignominious death, which every LOYAL HEART MUST THINK HIS TREASON JUSTLY DESERVED. Thus were, through the height of exce&s;&s;ive in|di&s;cretions, and the immoderate pur&s;uit
<PB N="243" REF="251">
of follies, two per&s;ons lo&s;t to the world and them&s;elves, and a noble youth terribly involved in their ruin, each of whom might otherwi&s;e have been &s;hining ornaments of the pre&s;ent age.</P>
<P>As I before hinted to the reader, Mr. Evelyn and Lady Generous in about three months &s;pace came to town, with a de&s;ign to &s;ettle in it for life.</P>
<P>Mr. Allworth joyfully received his friend, who de&s;ired Mr. Dumont might remain a &s;tranger to his arrival for &s;ome time; well knowing that a &s;udden &s;ur|prize to a melancholy mind, might po&s;&s;ibly be attended with dreadful con|&s;equences. And as Dumont was con|&s;cious that he had wrong'd Mr. Evelyn's friend&s;hip, which he often expre&s;s'd infinite concern for to Mr. Allworth; it was concluded, by &s;low degrees and gentle means, to make the di&s;covery.</P>
<P>Lady Generous and her papa re&s;ided at her lady&s;hip's town hou&s;e near St. James's; and though that amiable worthy creature's heart &s;till felt the ago|nizing pain of &s;eparation from the di|&s;tre&s;&s;ed object of her wi&s;hes; &s;he never once attempted at a propo&s;ition to h$r

father for an interview, po&s;itively re|&s;olving to be rather a &s;acrifice to the utmo&s;t dignity of virtue than betray a weakne&s;s that &s;hould put her on the common level of too many of her &s;ex.</P>
<P>Poor Mr. Dumont's misfortunes, had &s;o far deprived him of that noble &s;en&s;e he was once ma&s;ter of, that one day, taking a melancholly walk, without very well knowing where he &s;hould &s;teer his cour&s;e, he &s;tray'd (unknown to Mr. Allworth) as far as Brentford; and hearing a drum beat up for volun|teers, forgetful of him&s;elf, directly li&s;ted; his height, and beautiful per&s;on, attracted every eye with plea&s;ure and &s;urprize. The &s;erjeant that enli&s;ted him, found he had no common per&s;on in his power, and joyful at his &s;ucce&s;s, took coach, and went to Ken&s;ington, where his Colonel lodged; who was equally plea&s;ed at what the &s;erjeant had done, and went with him to the fir&s;t ju&s;tice of peace to have him imme|diately atte&s;ted; &s;trictly charging the &s;erjeant, to take him directly to the Savoy, and keep him clo&s;e confined,
<PB N="245" REF="253">
till they had orders to &s;ail; (the regiment being &s;oon to go abroad) but with this caution, to treat him with the utmo&s;t re&s;pect, as he was a gentleman, and in compa&s;&s;ion to his indi&s;po&s;ition, plainly perceiving he had a fever, attended with a terrible low|ne&s;s of &s;pirits, tho' ignorant from whence it proceeded, nor was it his bu&s;ine&s;s to enquire.</P>
<P>Mr. Dumont underwent a violent indi&s;po&s;ition in the Savoy, and as the Colonel was charmed with his appearance, took care to let him want for nothing but the u&s;e of a pen and ink, which was a dreadful motive of &s;orrow to poor Mr. Evelyn, and his friend Allworth; who not having heard of him for &s;ome weeks, con|cluded he had ra&s;hly de&s;troyed him|&s;elf; and tho' they adverti&s;ed him, no tidings could be gain'd. And both the&s;e gentlemen made it their daily bu&s;ine&s;s to go in que&s;t of him, but to no purpo&s;e. At length there came an order (a peace being concluded) to draught out &s;everal men, and place tho&s;e approved of in the guards, the
<PB N="246" REF="254">
others were di&s;charged accordingly.</P>
<P>Mr. Dumont was one of tho&s;e whom they were proud to keep; and di+rectly &s;tationed in the fir&s;t regiment. When he was at large, &s;hame would not permit him to let his friend All|worth know in what &s;ituation he was in; only directing a line to him, to &s;ignify that he was alive, and much better in health than he had been for &s;ome time; that if he could re|concile it to him&s;elf patiently, to en|dure his concealment a little longer, and forgive his abrupt departure, he &s;hould hear farther from him; but re|quired no an&s;wer, being re&s;olved (at that time) not to make any farther di&s;|covery.</P>
<P>This epi&s;tle reached Mr. Allworth by the penny po&s;t, which rendered it impo&s;&s;ible to make an enquiry concern|ing him. Mr. Evelyn was &s;oon ac|quainted with the contents, and tho' ex|ce&s;&s;ively unea&s;y, both he and Mr. Allworth were obliged to re&s;t &s;atisfied, till Mr. Dumont thought proper to give them farther information; not that he knew Mr. Evelyn was in town,
<PB N="247" REF="255">
nor did that worthy gentleman inform his daughter of what had befallen their lamented, unhappy friend.</P>
<P>Mr. Allworth being let into the &s;e|cret of Lady Generous's melancholly, advi&s;ed her papa, to per&s;uade her as much as po&s;&s;ible, to partake of all the polite and fa&s;hionable entertain|ment the town afforded; and with much difficulty they prevailed on her to go to the Opera; which as her lady|&s;hip was a very great proficient in mu|&s;ick, &s;he preferred to a play. Accord|ingly Mr. Allworth and her papa, with a young lady, accompanied her thither, and &s;at in one of the &s;tage boxes.</P>
<P>Lady Generous, notwith&s;tanding all the grief &s;he had for years &s;u&s;tained, &s;till pre&s;erved every native charm, and &s;truck the eye of each behold|er with a mo&s;t plea&s;ing a&s;toni&s;hment; but what was mo&s;t &s;urprizing, on her &s;eating her&s;elf in the box, the poor centinel, who was upon guard ju&s;t by it, &s;uddenly &s;tarting, dropped his piece on the &s;tage, and &s;tooping to recover it, was obliged to make a nearer approach; by which means,
<PB N="248" REF="256">
that company di&s;covered it was the un|happy Dumont; whom we may ea&s;ily conceive, to &s;uffer all the &s;hock and terror a great mind mu&s;t on &s;uch an oc|ca&s;ion be &s;u&s;ceptible of. Poor Lady Gene|rous was carried off for dead, whom as &s;oon as &s;he was conducted home, Mr. Allworth left, and returned to the opera, but found a fre&s;h guard to &s;upply Du|mont's place, who was render'd thro' his confu&s;ion, and &s;urprize, incapable of performing the duty of the night.</P>
<P>When Mr. Allworth mi&s;s'd him on the &s;tage, he a&s;k'd the &s;erjeant what was become of him, who inform'd him he was &s;ent to his quarters &s;peechle&s;s; and not knowing the cau&s;e, could give no other account than that he was thought to be taken with an apoplectick fit; upon which this worthy gentleman gave the hone&s;t &s;oldier a crown, to let him know where the poor fellow (as he thought proper to term him) was to be found; he was no &s;ooner informed, than with the mo&s;t friendly expedition, he &s;ought him out, and had him carefully placed in a hackney-chair, and convey'd to his own hou&s;e; it is true, he had re|cover'd
<PB N="249" REF="257" MS="Y">
his &s;en&s;es, but was &s;o extreamly ill, Mr. Allworth thought proper to have him put to bed, and &s;ent for one of the be&s;t phy&s;icians in town, who attended him all that night.</P>
<P>Next morning, Mr. Evelyn came to wait on him, when after having been properly prepair'd for the interview by Mr. Allworth, the&s;e long parted friends met, embrac'd, and with the moving eloquence of &s;ilent tears alone renew'd their former friend&s;hip. A farther de|&s;cription is needle&s;s on this occa&s;ion, as every generous mind mu&s;t naturally bear a part in the plea&s;ing angui&s;h, each mu&s;t feel on &s;o extraordinary an event.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as they were capable of con|ver&s;ing, Mr. Evelyn beg'd Mr. Dumont to be entirely conformable to the &s;kill and care of his phy&s;ician, in regard to his health: adding, that he was very certain providence had &s;till many ble&s;&s;ings in &s;tore for him; which if he made a pro|per u&s;e of, would compen&s;ate for all the &s;orrows he had undergone thro' his mi&s;|taken fondne&s;s for Mrs. Dumont. Here the afflicted gentleman &s;topt him, beg|ging him never to mention her again;
<PB N="250" REF="258">
adding, that he did not chu&s;e to expa|tiate on that &s;ubject, he could only con|fe&s;s his folly, and implore his pardon for the in&s;olent di&s;regard he paid his friend|&s;hip, which was &s;o anxiou&s;ly employ'd to have &s;aved him from de&s;truction.</P>
<P>He then changed the di&s;cour&s;e, by a friendly enquiry after Lady Generous; whom he &s;aw carried in a chair from the box to her coach; dreading an ac|count, lea&s;t it &s;hould end in an infor|mation of her being in danger: but her papa eas'd him of that fear, a&s;&s;uring him, that he had great hopes of her recovery; and that as &s;oon as &s;he could receive company, and he was able to go abroad, intreated him to favour her with a vi&s;it. What, &s;aid Dumont, favour a noble Lady with a vi&s;it from a poor &s;oldier? No! that honour&mdash;Here Mr. Evelyn in|terrupted his farther &s;peech, be&s;eeching him to con&s;ider him&s;elf the man he real|ly was, and to think of this &s;trange vici&s;|&s;itude of fortune, ordain'd by Heaven, as a gentle puni&s;hment for having de&s;ert|ed tho&s;e manifold virtues it endow'd him with; and which the &s;ame providen|tial care would give him power to re&s;ume,
<PB N="251" REF="259">
and overcome the torrent of di&s;tre&s;&s;es that had overwhelm'd him.</P>
<P>Mr. Allworth's friendly care was employ'd in attending Mr. Dumont till his recovery, while Mr. Evelyn was equally a&s;&s;iduous in gaining his di&s;charge; which, as he was cautious in expo&s;ing a noble family, by not confe&s;&s;ing who he was, he found impracticable, and was at la&s;t, reduced to a nece&s;&s;ity of doing it to effect his purpo&s;e. When that was ac|compli&s;h'd, Mr. Evelyn brought the di&s;charge, which Mr. Dumont thank|fully received; telling him, that if he had but prudently left him&s;elf as much as would have purchas'd a commi&s;&s;ion, he &s;hould have been both ready and willing to have employ'd the remaining part of life in the &s;ervice of his country: but now ala&s;s! I have nothing to depend on, but the hopes and certainty of dying, to rid my&s;elf of tho&s;e &s;orrows my follies have de&s;ervedly inflicted. That, &s;ir, can never be, an&s;wered Mr. Evelyn, while the&s;e writings are in force, which intitled me to a genteel revenue from your wor|thy Grand&s;ire, and are no longer mine, &s;ince your nece&s;&s;ity, and my own gra|titude,
<PB N="252" REF="260" MS="Y">
demand a re&s;toration, where they are &s;o amply due. Mr. Dumont re|ceived the generous and grateful de&s;ign with that noblene&s;s of &s;oul was ever natural to him; but on no terms could be prevail'd on to accept the writings; which notwith&s;tanding his po&s;itive refu|&s;al, Mr. Evelyn privately left in the hands of Mr. Allworth, and for that time took leave till next day; bringing with him, a friendly, and indeed a grateful invitation from his worthy daughter, in|&s;i&s;ting by their former friend&s;hip, that he would accept her father's offer; and al&s;o one from her&s;elf, which was &s;ent in bank notes, to the amount of ten thou&s;and pounds; entreating him, not to be offend|ed, as &s;he thought he had a more na|tural right to it than her&s;elf; it be|ing the happy effect of the generous Count's benevolence be&s;tow'd on her infancy.</P>
<P>It is impo&s;&s;ible to de&s;cribe the torrent of joy flowing round the heart of this late unfortunate gentleman, who not|with&s;tanding his poverty &s;till per&s;i&s;ted in a refu&s;al of their offers. Mr. Evelyn
<PB N="253" REF="261" MS="Y">
having re&s;olved within him&s;elf, with|out his daughter's knowledge, to make them both happy, propo&s;ed a treaty of marriage; which he al&s;o rejected, though in a mode&s;t &s;en&s;ible manner; an&s;wering Mr. Evelyn, that the only objection he had was, that as blind for|tune had &s;o cruelly mi&s;led him when in the height of affluence, he would not pay &s;o ill a compliment, to bring a beggar to her arms; adding, that could time and circum&s;tances be re|call'd, he &s;hould have been indeed a happy man, had Lady Generous and he conceived a tender pa&s;&s;ion for each other at the time Sir John paid his addre&s;&s;es to that valuable creature. Upon which Mr. Evelyn began to unfold the &s;ecret of his daughter's love, po&s;itively affirming, that her whole &s;oul had been entirely devoted to him from the age of fifteen, and was the &s;ad motive of that grief, &s;he even to the pre&s;ent mo|ment &s;uffer'd; and that her delicacy of di&s;po&s;ition had made her a virtuous &s;acrifice to the nice&s;t rules of mode&s;ty and honour, and that &s;he was entirely ignorant of the di&s;covery he had made;
<PB N="254" REF="262">
but was determined to let him know it, to prevent his &s;uffering the lo&s;s of &s;o de&s;erving a child.</P>
<P>This recital gave poor Dumont the tend're&s;t emotions of heart, and a tran|&s;port appear'd in his countenance, which great &s;ouls alone are capable of feeling, blended with a generous pity and &s;oft concern for the afflicted lady; yet &s;till he urged his want of fortune, which would, &s;hould he pay his addre&s;&s;es, make him appear rather a mercenary than a grateful lover.</P>
<P>Mr. Allworth &s;oon gave him proof of his not being that indigent per&s;on he conceived him&s;elf, re&s;toring to him the writings of his e&s;tate, which he in madne&s;s deliver'd to the two &s;trangers whom he thought had lawfully po&s;&s;e&s;s'd them&s;elves of it; but Sir, &s;aid he, as I perceived the danger of your ruin, I artfully prevented it, by procuring two worthy friends, whom I could entru&s;t for once, if I may be allow'd the phra&s;e, to be guilty of an hone&s;t fraud, with loaded dice, a whole fortune fell into their hands, from the re&s;ult of your di|&s;tracted mind; the writings which you

ha&s;tily gave to them were &s;ecretly de|liver'd to me, which with unbounded tran&s;port I now re&s;tore, and have ever &s;ince I had the honour, Sir, of being through my friend Evelyn's means, in your family, been &s;ecretly and indu&s;tri|ou&s;ly employ'd in taking care of your affairs, all which are retrievable. One thing I mu&s;t add, Sir, though Mr. Eve|lyn needs no addition to his character; this was a &s;ecret even to him, therefore you may be a&s;&s;ured his offer of his daugh|ter was entirely di&s;intere&s;ted. Oh Sir, replied Dumont, who had &s;carce power of utterance, Mr. Evelyn's merit can only be equal'd by my worthy grand&s;ire, who as far &s;urpa&s;&s;ed all others, as Heaven is &s;uperior to the earth; there is but one more who can vie with them, which is your worthy &s;elf, who&s;e meritorious act of friend&s;hip, I &s;hall think poorly rewarded in the acceptance of five hun|dred pounds a year during life, and a grateful donation to the friends he em|ploy'd. All matters being properly adju&s;ted, Mr. Evelyn went home and prepared Lady Generous to her ine$|pre&s;&s;ible &s;urprize and joy to receive Mr.

Dumont for a hu&s;band; in a few days their nuptials were publickly &s;olemnized at St. Paul's cathedral, and was the ble&s;s'd means of re&s;toration of peace and fortune to this worthy pair.</P>
<P>Not long after this happy union, Mr. Jennings came to England with his fa|mily, con&s;i&s;ting only of his lady and &s;on, exclu&s;ive of &s;ervants, among whom was Mr. Ledger, his clerk, who&s;e fidelity in that office entitled him to his ma&s;ter's friend&s;hip during life. Mr. and Mrs. Leice&s;ter were both dead, that gentle|man not being able to overcome the &s;hocking reflection of the wrongs Mr. Powel had &s;u&s;tain'd, fell into a decay which carried him off, and his wife &s;oon fol|low'd from the re&s;ult of a tender affection, which render'd it impo&s;&s;ible for her to &s;upport his lo&s;s; as they died without i&s;&s;ue, Mr. Powel was made his heir, which happy beque&s;t added many thou|&s;and pounds to his fortune; his two &s;ons were grown up, and as the father had more than a &s;ufficient competence, were jointly concern'd in the trade the father had &s;ucce&s;sfully carried on for &s;ome years, each marrying two of the greate&s;t for|tunes

<P>I need not tire the reader's patience in a de&s;cription of the interview of Mr. Dumont's and Mr. Jennings's family, that mu&s;t be naturally and ea&s;ily con|ceived: I &s;hall only beg leave to inform them that at fir&s;t &s;ight Ma&s;ter Jennings and Mi&s;s Generous mutually conceived a fond regard, which when they both came of age, was rewarded by a happy marriage; and they are now, without ex|ception, the greate&s;t examples of con|&s;tancy and virtue to all who enter into a connubial &s;tate; whil&s;t the parents on both &s;ides are ble&s;s'd with the injoyment of their little prattling offspring to com|fort them in age, and more than make amends for pa&s;t afflictions.</P>

has already been enlarged upon and di&s;|cu&s;&s;ed by &s;everal beyond Controver&s;y; and indeed the Thing it&s;elf (had a Word never been mentioned on the Subject) loudly proclaims the Nece&s;&s;ity of &s;ome|thing of that Nature; and the va&s;t Ad|vantage accruing to tho&s;e who make U&s;e of them, both in Re&s;pect to the Small|ne&s;s of Expence and Quickne&s;s of Di&s;|patch, tends not a little to prove the Be|nefit they are of to the Publick in gene|ral. It has been a Matter of Wonder to many, why &s;uch a Scheme &s;hould not long ago have been thought of: where by applying, every Member of Society may meet with an immediate Supply to their &s;everal Wants, without the va&s;t Expence and Inconveniences they are often put to. The Buyer is often at a Lo&s;s for a Seller; the Landlord, a Tenant; the Tutor, a Pupil; the Ma&s;ter, for an U&s;her and a Scholar; the Rector, a Curate; the Man of Ta&s;te, for an ingenious Ar|tificer; the Traveller, a Companion; the Merchant, Trade&s;man, &amp;c. for a Part|ner, Bookeeper, Apprentice, &amp;c. and <HI>vice ver&s;a</HI>; all which is the Bu&s;ine&s;s of
