<HEAD>TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE The EARL of BATH.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MY LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AFTER having written a Play entirely without your Knowledge; and after having frankly confe&s;&s;ed, that I only concealed my De&s;ign, becau&s;e I doubted of its meeting with your Approbation: Excu&s;e me, if I at|tempt to vindicate one Act of Pre&s;umption by another; and now the Piece is come abroad into the World, give me leave to hope that You will take it under your Protection.</P>
<P>When I addre&s;s my&s;elf to You on &s;o publick an Occa&s;ion, they, who know how much I owe to You, will undoubtedly expect that I &s;hall not let &s;lip &s;o fair an Opportunity of ex|pre&s;&s;ing my Gratitude. They will naturally imagine, that the Countenance You have ever &s;hewn me, the Kindne&s;s and Indulgence with which you have treated me, and your continued Acts of Benevolence and Genero&s;ity to me, will not be forgot; but that I &s;hall dwell with Plea&s;ure on a Subject, whereon I have nothing to &s;ay but what comes immediately from my Heart.</P>
<P><PB REF="3">
The World, however, is deceived. Your eminent Qualities are too well known, for me to expatiate on them: And as to your particular Goodne&s;s to me, That, I fear, becomes too incon&s;iderable for general Notice from the Ob|ject on which it has been exerted. I &s;hould chu&s;e, therefore, rather to fail into another Vein: To &s;hew that Scholars and Writers have a Title to your Patronage; and to prove, that You, of all Per&s;ons in the great World, are the very Man, with whom it is mo&s;t likely that an Adventurer in Letters &s;hould make free.</P>
<P>Let us only review your Life and Conver|&s;ation, the Company You have always kept, and the Methods by which You have &s;ignalized Your&s;elf in this Kingdom! Were not your earlie&s;t Connections formed with an Attention to Literature? Were not your intimate Ac|quaintance the mo&s;t eminent Men of their Time, remarkable not only for worldly Ta|lents, and what are called &s;olid Under&s;tandings, but di&s;tingui&s;hed by that Brilliancy and Vivacity, peculiar to the Lovers of the <HI>Belles Lettres?</HI> Did not You even conde&s;cend to a&s;&s;ociate with the profe&s;&s;ed Wits of the Age? It is well known, that You have pa&s;&s;ed many a &s;ocial Evening with <HI>Steele</HI> and <HI>Addi&s;on;</HI> You have joined in the rich Humour of <HI>Arbuthnot;</HI> You have read the Comedies of <HI>Congreve,</HI> (my Brother-Student of the Law) in Manu&s;cript; You have corre&s;ponded with <HI>Pope</HI> and <HI>Swift;</HI> and <HI>Gay</HI> lived and wrote in your Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>How You &s;pent your Time in this dangerous Company, it is too ea&s;y to conceive. The
<PB REF="4">
Turn and Spirit of your Compo&s;itions, not|with&s;tanding your Endeavours to be concealed, &s;oon betrayed You for their Author. Deep in the My&s;teries of Politicks, and acquainted with the Revolution of every Wheel of Govern|ment, You rendered your other Talents &s;ub|&s;ervient to the&s;e greater Purpo&s;es. You have been frequently known to &s;ea&s;on the Severity of Debate, by a &s;trong Leaven of Plea&s;antry and Humour: Nay more, if&punc; I may believe what I have heard, You have not been con|tented merely with di&s;playing your Eloquence in Parliament, but have exerci&s;ed your other Talents, for the &s;ame End, in Concert with other wicked Wits, without Doors.</P>
<P>This, my Lord, is the Character, which I am told, You have always borne in the World; and I mu&s;t confe&s;s, that, in my Opinion, You are not in the lea&s;t altered. Notwith&s;tanding You are &s;o much farther advanced in Life, You have as much Wit, and, for ought I &s;ee, as great a Love for Wit, and Tendency to be witty, as ever. If a Pamphlet appears, who&s;e Solidity of Argument, and Strength of Stile, gives an Alarm to the Publick, it is imme|diately attributed to the Earl of <HI>Bath.</HI> If a little <HI>Jeu d'E&s;prit,</HI> or a <HI>Bon Mot,</HI> goes about the Town, ten to one but it is &s;aid to be the Earl of <HI>Bath</HI>'s. I perhaps am que&s;tioned about it. I know nothing of the Matter: But from what I &s;ee of the Earl of <HI>Bath,</HI> I am always apt to think, that, if the Work is ma&s;terly, Nobody is more equal to the Execu|tion of it; or, if the Wit is excellent, Nobody
<PB REF="5">
is &s;o likely to have thrown it out in &s;uch a carele&s;s Manner, as to have forgot, almo&s;t im|mediately, what they who heard it, always mu&s;t remember.</P>
<P>Filled with this Idea of your Character, how can I bring my&s;elf to make a formal Apology for the pre&s;ent Undertaking? I do not find that your Wit has ever done You any Harm: That mine, if I had any, &s;hould, like Yours, be made conducive to greater Ends, might, I fear, rather be wi&s;hed than expected: And yet, whether "I &s;hall leave a Calling for this idle Trade," is a Point, which, I hope, the World will not too ha&s;tily decide, but candidly leave to Time alone to determine. If I am to blame in what I have done, You have been in Part the innocent Occa&s;ion of it, and mu&s;t give me Leave to quote You as a fre&s;h In&s;tance of the dangerous Quality of Wit, and in the Spirit of <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI>'s <HI>Dogberry,</HI> to de&s;ire You <Q>&startq;to cor|rect Your&s;elf for the Example of others.&endq;</Q></P>

<L>At Vice and Folly, each a lawful Game,</L>
<L>Our Author flies, but with no <HI>partial</HI> Aim.</L>

<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>THE U&s;e that has been made in this Comedy of <HI>Fielding</HI>'s admirable Novel of <HI>Tom Jones,</HI> mu&s;t be obvious to the mo&s;t ordinary Reader. Some Hints have al&s;o been taken from the Account of Mr. and Mrs. <HI>Freeman,</HI> in N^o. 212, and N^o. 216, of the <HI>Spectator;</HI> and the &s;hort Scene of <HI>Charles</HI>'s Intoxication, at the End of the Third Act, is partly an Imitation of the Behaviour of <HI>Syrus,</HI> much in the &s;ame Circum&s;tances, in the <HI>Adelphi</HI> of <HI>Terence.</HI> There are al&s;o &s;ome Traces of the Character of the Jealous Wife, in one of the latter Papers of the <HI>Connoi&s;&s;eur.</HI></P>
<P>It would be unju&s;t, indeed, to omit mentioning my Obligations to Mr. <HI>Garrick.</HI> To his In&s;pection the Comedy was &s;ubmitted in its fir&s;t rude State; and to my Care and Attention to follow his Advice in many Particulars, relating both to the Fable and Characters, I know that I am much indebted for the Reception which this Piece has met with from the Publick.</P>

<P>I can hold no longer. <STAGE>[Going to Her.]</STAGE> My Affection for You, Madam, is as warm as ever, Nothing can ever extingui&s;h it.

<P>O, Mr. <HI>Oakly,</HI> how have I expo&s;ed My&s;elf! What low Arts has my Jealou&s;y induced Me to practice! I &s;ee my Folly, and fear that You can never forgive Me.</P>

I beg Pardon, Si&s;ter, for taking the Liberty to pre&s;cribe for You. My Medicines have been &s;omewhat rough, I believe, but they have had an admirable Effect, and &s;o don't be an|gry with your Phy&s;ician.</P>
