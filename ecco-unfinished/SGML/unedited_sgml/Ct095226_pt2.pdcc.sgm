</ARGUMENT>
<P>AT length a reign ari&s;es, undi&s;turbed by the di&s;orders of a minority;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1488</NOTE> and forming a &s;trong contra&s;t to the preceding in &s;pirit, and ability. The young monarch was &s;oon to de|velope a character brightened with many illu&s;trious qualities, and darkened with few &s;hades. His &s;trict admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice, by which the realm was maintained in a tranquillity long unknown, his uniform concord with his nobles, his mag|nificence, his genero&s;ity, his patronage of u&s;eful arts and &s;ciences, particularly navigation, which had been &s;trangely
<PB N="2" REF="8">neglected by the Scoti&s;h monarchs, and even his &s;pirit of chi|valry, were to render his reign popular and glorious. Nor has it been unju&s;tly a&s;&s;erted that the period of his domination was that of the greate&s;t wealth, and power, of Scotland, while a &s;eparate kingdom. Yet &s;ome of his qualities were rather &s;pecious than &s;olid, and rather belonged to chivalrous romance than to real life: in the high regal duties of a politician, and of a general, he was extremely defective; his natural im|petuo&s;ity predominating alike in his &s;maller pur&s;uits, and in his mo&s;t important affairs. The avarice of the preceding reign he contra&s;ted by a profu&s;ion, which &s;ecured the attach|ment of the peers at the expence of the people. That &s;uper|&s;titious devotion, which, with a few exceptions, was inherent in his family from its fir&s;t elevation, till its final de&s;cent from the throne, was in the fourth James much increa&s;ed by his re|mor&s;e for the death of his father; and the ma&s;s formed one of his chief daily offices. The re&s;ources of his magnificence were not exempt from a charge of extortion: but his gentlene&s;s, and affability, won all hearts, and &s;tifled all murmurs. Ju&s;t in his decrees, the &s;everity of puni&s;hment was &s;oftened by his vi&s;ible reluctance to cha&s;ti&s;e. To admonition, or even re|proach, his ear was open; and his &s;en&s;e of an innocent con|&s;cience &s;uch that he li&s;tened without the &s;malle&s;t emotion. By a neglected education he was ignorant of letters; but his mind was acute; he excelled in mu&s;ic, in hor&s;eman&s;hip, and other exerci&s;es; and a firm con&s;titution enabled him to &s;upport every fatigue. His per&s;on was of the middle &s;ize, and ele|gant; his countenance maje&s;tic<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Compare Lind&s;ay, 159, 160; Le&s;ley 330; Buch. XIII, 42. In the new edition of Leland's Collectanea, Vol. IV, p. 258, &s;eq. may be found minute anecdotes of his manners, &amp;c. in 1503. One pa&s;&s;age mentions that "his beard was &s;omewhat long;" but beards were not then worn, and the meaning is &s;uch as would apply in our times, that he had neglected to &s;have, or to cut in clo&s;e with &s;eizzars, as, by the &s;ame account, was done on his wedding day.</NOTE>.</P>
<PB N="3" REF="9">
<P>The fate of James III being unknown to the con&s;piring lords, they withdrew their forces to Linlithgow,<NOTE PLACE="marg">June</NOTE> till certain information &s;hould be obtained. Tidings arrived that Sir An|drew Wood's two &s;hips, &s;ailing up and down the Forth, re|ceived in their boats &s;everal wounded men, among whom it was &s;u&s;pected that the king might have found his &s;afety. The lords upon this advanced to Leith, and &s;ent me&s;&s;engers to Wood, to enquire if James was aboard either of his ve&s;&s;els: the commander denied that he was; but the lords, un&s;atisfied, in&s;i&s;ted that he &s;hould appear before their council, to which he con&s;ented upon condition that the lords Seton and Fleming &s;hould be remitted, as pledges for his &s;afe return. Upon his appearance, he denied any knowledge concerning the king, and boldly reproached the peers for their trea&s;on; who&s;e ven|geance was only repre&s;&s;ed by the con&s;ideration of their pledges<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Lind&s;ay, 145&mdash;147. Buchan. XIII, 1. The former writer narrates the &s;tory with his u&s;ual circum&s;tantial &s;implicity. The names of Wood's two ve&s;&s;els were, the Flower and the Yellow Carvel, (<HI>carvel</HI> a galley, a &s;hip.) The pa&s;&s;age in which James mi&s;takes Wood for his father is pathetic, but can have no claim to truth, James being &s;ixteen years of age, and certainly knowing his father perfectly. No hint of previous e&s;trangement occurs: on the contrary the prince re&s;ided at Stirling, the cho&s;en abode of his father.</NOTE>. Seton and Fleming having returned, upon Wood's deliverance, it was re&s;olved to puni&s;h that brave officer for his in&s;ulting be|haviour; but the captains and mariners of Leith declined the hazardous &s;ervice, and informed the council that no ten &s;hips of Scotland would dare to a&s;&s;ault Wood's two ve&s;&s;els, &s;uch was his &s;trength in men and artillery, and &s;uch his maritime and military &s;kill<NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">Lind&s;ay, 147, who on this occa&s;ion mentious BARTON, a name famous in the naval annals of Scotland. Buch. XIII, 1.</NOTE>. Amid the &s;ignal fortuitous advantages of the
<PB N="4" REF="10">reign of James III may be placed the fir&s;t minute appearance of a warlike fleet in Scotland: and the warm loyalty of Wood &s;eems to indicate that this e&s;tabli&s;hment was indebted to royal patronage.</P>
<P>A &s;hort &s;pace of time certified the unhappy death of the late &s;overeign.<NOTE PLACE="marg">24 June</NOTE> The &s;olemn inauguration of James IV was no &s;ooner celebrated at Scone, than a revocation was publi&s;hed of all lands, dignities, and offices, granted by his father, &s;ince the &s;econd day of February la&s;t; for the a&s;&s;igned rea&s;on that &s;uch gifts had been be&s;towed in &s;upport of a council who op|po&s;ed the public good<NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">This revocation is mentioned in the Acts of Oct. this year, f. 83, c. 17.</NOTE>. The young monarch then proceeded to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the ca&s;tle of Edinburgh, which had been garri&s;oned by the late king: and to that of Stirling a new go|vernor was appointed<NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot">Lind&s;ay, 148. Buch. XIII, 2.</NOTE>. But neither the cares, nor the plea|&s;ures of royalty could &s;ave his mind from the keene&s;t remor&s;e, when he con&s;idered his con&s;trained &s;hare in the fate of his father. Re&s;iding for &s;ome time at Stirling the prie&s;ts of the royal chapel deplored, in his pre&s;ence, and even in their pray|ers, the death of their founder; and the &s;olemnity of religion increa&s;ed the mental gloom of his &s;on; who re&s;olved, with amiable &s;uper&s;tition, to wear con&s;tantly in penance an iron girdle, the weight of which he increa&s;ed with his years. The Roman pontiff &s;pared the youth and innocence of James; but darted the thunders of the Vatican at the rebellious barons, who&s;e arms had been pointed again&s;t their &s;overeign<NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot">Lind&s;ay, ib.

IV, App. Whit&s;untide 1488.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Of the parliament, which a&s;&s;embled at Edinburgh this year,<NOTE PLACE="marg">6 Oct.</NOTE> the mo&s;t remarkable act is that intituled, The Propo&s;ition of
<PB N="5" REF="11">the debate of the field of Stirling. By this &s;tatute it is de|clared that the late king's want of &s;idelity, in the ob&s;ervance of certain articles, affirmed to the peers by his own &s;ub&s;crip|tion; his confidence in perver&s;e councils; and his partiality to the Engli&s;h; are to be e&s;teemed the efficient cau&s;es of his fate: and that his &s;on, and the con&s;piring peers, were innocent of any blood &s;hed in that civil conflict<NOTE N="7" PLACE="foot">Acts, f. v. 82. The chief managers of this parliament, and &s;ome of its proceedings, may be traced in Carmichael's Tracts, 76&mdash;78. Argyle continues chancellor, Hales is ma&s;ter of the hou&s;hold, Lyle ju&s;ticiary, Home chamber|lain, Knowls of Torphichen trea&s;urer. The impri&s;onment of Angus by the late king, p. 77, &s;eems unknown. On the 15th Oct. p. 78, Patrick Hepburn lord Hales was created earl of Bothwell. Titles were now becoming vague, the lords Lyle, Carlyle, &amp;c. being &s;o &s;tyled from their names: but Bothwell had only the advantage of being a title already u&s;ed. The barony had been forfeited by Douglas, 1455; and was before 1528 to return to Angus.
<P>From Scot&s;tarvet's Calendars it appears that Largo was confirmed to Wood, 27 July 1488: that Hales or Bothwell was created "great Admiral of Scotland for life," in the &s;ame month: on the 10th Sept. an annuity of 300 marks was granted to James Douglas knight, (the degraded earl?) in Oct. the cu&s;tody of Dunbarton ca&s;tle, formerly held by Evandale, was given to Lennox and his &s;on; as that of Stirling was, in the en&s;uing January, a&s;&s;igned to James Shaw of Sauchy, and John Shaw of Alweth his &s;on. John Ellem was forfeited for de|fending Dunbar again&s;t James III.</P></NOTE>. It is unnece&s;&s;ary to enter into the warm political di&s;putes, which have originated from this in&s;titute of &s;ucce&s;sful rebellion, which partakes &s;o little of fundamental law, and &s;o much of temporary circum&s;tances. At pre&s;ent this ari&s;tocratic deed will be &s;ufficiently under&s;tood to infer no advantage to public freedom. But in con&s;equence of this parliamentary declaration, of the royal favour to the nobles during this reign, and of their increa&s;ing power under the &s;ucceeding minority; principles of government, far indeed from new, but unknown for many centuries, began to pre|vail in Scotland. Enlightened enough to perceive the defects, incidental to monarchical government, but not to de&s;cry its
<PB N="6" REF="12">la&s;ting advantages; and at the &s;ame time &s;o un&s;killed as to pre|fer many tyrants to one, and to confound the nation with the nobles, the intere&s;ts of a million and a half of people with tho&s;e of fifty chiefs; the Scoti&s;h hi&s;torians, Mair, Boyce, Bu|chanan, were to declaim again&s;t monarchy; and, under the name of the popular power, to &s;upport that of the ari&s;tocracy. As they have indicated no new organ, by which the national will was to be declared; and no reform in parliament, a body guided by the king, or by the nobles; it is evident that their views were either theoretical efferve&s;cences, caught from the cla&s;&s;ical writers, or tended &s;olely to increa&s;e the ari&s;tocratic preeminence.</P>
<P>This parliament al&s;o decreed that an emba&s;&s;y &s;hould be &s;ent to France, Bretagne, Spain, and other countries, to provide a bride for the king<NOTE N="8" PLACE="foot">Acts, f. 79. Of the 26th Dec. 1489, appears a grant to Elphin&s;ton bi&s;hop of Aberdeen, for his &s;ervices in his emba&s;&s;y to France, <HI>England,</HI> Bur|gundy, Au&s;tria. Scot&s;t. Cal. The main object &s;eems to have been, the vin|dication of James from the apparent murder of his father. The act of indem|nity bears that it was to be &s;hewn to foreign courts.</NOTE>. England being omitted, it is evident that the new reign had, as not unu&s;ual, rever&s;ed the political maxims of the former. The emba&s;&s;adors were likewi&s;e em|powered to renew the league between France and Scotland: but this emba&s;&s;y was not effected. Other &s;tatutes appear con|cerning the late civil commotions: all ju&s;tices, &s;heriffs, &s;tew|ards, and other officers who had joined the late king, were, if hereditary, &s;u&s;pended for three years; if not, utterly incapaci|tated: churchmen taken in arms were to be delivered to their ordinary, for legal puni&s;hment: tho&s;e heirs who had been di&s;|inherited by their loyal fathers, on account of their attachment to the prince, were re&s;tored to their claim: as a &s;mall act of grace, all goods, taken &s;ince the battle near Stirling, from
<PB N="7" REF="13">burge&s;&s;es, merchants and unlanded men, though the late king's partizans, are ordered to be re&s;tored; together with per&s;onal freedom, and compen&s;ation. Such ordinances rather be&s;peak the influence of a party, than the equity of a monarch; while an act of general indemnity would have been a mea&s;ure of ju&s;tice and prudence. Decrees of a wider import order that foreign ve&s;&s;els &s;hall only trade with the free burghs of the realm, and not purcha&s;e fi&s;h, nor enter into any commerce, at the i&s;le of Leuis, or other di&s;tant places. The u&s;ual regula|tions and privileges of the church are to be ob&s;erved. It is ordained that a new coinage of gold and &s;ilver be i&s;&s;ued; and that bullion be imported. The ca&s;tle of Dunbar is ordered to be demoli&s;hed; and the cu&s;tody of that of Edinburgh is com|mitted to lord Hales, with the care of the king's brother, James duke of Ro&s;s. The king is advi&s;ed to travel through his dominions, for the admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice, and the lords of the ju&s;ticiary are ordered to attend him, as he or his council &s;hall appoint. For the more effectual &s;ecurity of public order, certain noblemen and gentlemen are empowered to puni&s;h theft, &s;poil, and other outrages, committed within the limits of their own domains, and the lands adjacent, till the king &s;hall attain the age of twenty one years. It is remarkable that, in the &s;pecification of territory, the northern counties of Ro&s;s, Sutherland, and Caithne&s;s, are omitted; with the i&s;lands Hebudes, and the Orkneys; a proof, among many, of the &s;low progre&s;s of public juri&s;diction in Scotland<NOTE N="9" PLACE="foot">Acts. f. 79&mdash;84.

But this lenity was &s;oon di&s;covered to be premature.</P>
<P>Many of the nobles &s;till nouri&s;hed the memory of their loyalty to James III, and were much di&s;&s;atisfied with the pre&s;ent mea&s;ures. They affected to regard the king as a cap|tive in the hands of his father's murderers; and to execrate the fortunate rebels, who, not content with e&s;caping public vengeance them&s;elves, dared to hurl it again&s;t the loyal and the good; and being the authors of injury, never could pardon. Alexander lord Forbes di&s;played in Aberdeen, and other northern towns and regions, the bloody &s;hirt of the murdered &s;overeign, &s;u&s;pended from a &s;pear; and loudly &s;ummoned all good &s;ubjects to revenge. This &s;pectacle, like the robe of Cae&s;ar, arou&s;ed more than any power of eloquence: and the flame began to &s;pread to a great extent, and violence, when it was &s;uddenly extingui&s;hed. For the di&s;contented nobles, (among whom were &s;ome who had engaged in the prince's cau&s;e, but had now rea&s;ons of enmity again&s;t his coun&s;ellors,) having fixed, and communicated, their de&s;igns, the earl of Lennox led a con&s;iderable force towards the north, to join their &s;tandard. Finding it impracticable to march by the bridge of Stirling, he turned to the we&s;t, intending to pa&s;s the Forth by a ford; and encamped at a &s;pot called Tilly-mo&s;s. One of his followers, named Macalpin, de&s;erted; and gave intelligence to lord Drummond, then apparently with the
<PB N="9" REF="15">court at Stirling, that the camp of Lennox was void of watch or military di&s;cipline, and expo&s;ed to every danger of &s;ecurity. Drummond, a&s;&s;embling a few attendants of the court, and volunteers, ha&s;tily advanced, and attacked the &s;leep of Len|nox and his people. Confu&s;ion, death, flight, terminated the idle expedition. The captives were taken with indifference, and di&s;mi&s;&s;ed with contempt; except a few of tumultuous &s;pirit, who were di&s;tingui&s;hed by puni&s;hment. The fate of Lennox is unmentioned in our annals, and &s;tatutes; but he was apparently captured and pardoned. This in&s;urrection was the more remarkable, as Lennox had received his title, and the command of Dunbarton ca&s;tle, from the young monarch. Lord Lyle, another favourer of the prince again&s;t his father, and Matthew Stuart, apparently the heir of Lennox, defended Dunbarton ca&s;tle again&s;t the government; but that fortre&s;s was taken, and the &s;ucceeding parliament granted a remi&s;&s;ion to the captives<NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">Le&s;ley, 330, dates the in&s;urrection of Lennox in 1488; Buchanan's chro|nology XIII, 4, 5, inclines to 1489.

The king de&s;ires him to keep his &s;trong holds &s;trictly, for the royal behoof, as the earl Mar&s;hal, Alex|ander Ma&s;ter of Huntley, Alexander lord Forbes, &amp;c. are forming trea&s;onable leagues at Dunbarton ca&s;tle. The renewed forfeiture of Lennox, his &s;on, and Lyle, in the parliament of Feb. 1490, (Carm. 79); and the remi&s;&s;ion to &s;uch of their adherents as held Dunbarton ca&s;tle, in the &s;ame parliament, (Acts, f. 90,) concur in ju&s;tifying the date here a&s;&s;igned.</NOTE>.</P>

<P>Several important &s;tatutes were i&s;&s;ued by the parliament<NOTE N="7" PLACE="foot">Acts, f. 84&mdash;90.</NOTE> The king,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1490 15 Feb.</NOTE> and his council, were empowered to e&s;tabli&s;h uni|ver&s;al concord among the &s;ubjects; and to puni&s;h tho&s;e who rejected an equitable amity. The payment of the tax, ordered
<PB N="11" REF="17">by the la&s;t parliament, to defray the expences of the emba&s;&s;y, is enforced; and it is declared that the king's remi&s;&s;ion of any per&s;on's &s;hare is void, as the king could not di&s;charge a tax granted by the e&s;tates for an appointed purpo&s;e: an act leading to valuable con&s;equences. A new revocation appears of all grants, and gifts, made of the royal revenue, &s;ince the coro|nation of James. Auditors were appointed to in&s;pect the accompts of the trea&s;urer, and other officers employed in the management of the crown-rents both in this, and the pre|ceding reign. To collect the king's property, or the proceeds of the royal domains, certain noblemen and gentlemen are nominated for each county; and there is rea&s;on to infer, from the enumeration, that this revenue was large, but we unhap|pily find no e&s;timates: it appears that there were now regal lands of more or le&s;s extent, in every region of Scotland, even to the Orkneys; except Sutherland, Caithne&s;s, the Hebudes, and the oppo&s;ite coa&s;t from Knapdale northwards. The earls of Sutherland, and of Caithne&s;s, remote from the court, ap|pear never to have engaged in faction; while the ju&s;t forfeiture of the Hebudes had not been carried into complete effect from the want of a fleet, and of the means of &s;upporting garri&s;ons, nece&s;&s;ary to maintain the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a remote di&s;trict, and the obedience of a &s;avage people, to whom the Scoti&s;h juri&s;|diction was unknown<NOTE N="8" PLACE="foot">In 1475 John lord of the I&s;les was forfeited: in 1476 he was re&s;tored, on yielding Ro&s;s, &amp;c. to the crown.

Yet about 1490 he was forfeited, &s;ays Douglas, (Peerage 357 &s;eq.) as appears from many charters between 1490 and 1498. But in Scot&s;tarvet's Calendars the fir&s;t mention of his forfeiture occurs in a charter of Aug. 1493.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>This parliament al&s;o proceeded to appoint proper per&s;ons, as a &s;ecret council to the king; among whom the earl of Craw|ford,
<PB N="12" REF="18">who&s;e title of duke of Montro&s;e, had been recently confirmed for his life, appears to have been the &s;ole follower of the late monarch, who gained admi&s;&s;ion: and this peer was indeed the chief loyali&s;t who finally adhered to James III; the influence of the others being incon&s;iderable. No royal act was to be regarded as authentic, except it were &s;ub&s;cribed by at lea&s;t &s;ix of the &s;ecret council; and the chancellor's con&s;ent was indi&s;pen&s;able.</P>
<P>Emba&s;&s;ies of alliance were ordered to France, Spain, and Denmark. The truce, made with England, was enforced by regulations for the holding of &s;olemn march-days, in order to &s;ettle differences, &s;o long as the Engli&s;h te&s;tified the like de&s;ire. Many other &s;tatutes of public utility were pa&s;&s;ed, which reflect no &s;mall prai&s;e on the attention of the new government to the national advantage.</P>
<P>Amid the imperfections, and di&s;cordance, of the original accounts, it is difficult to adju&s;t, with chronological preci&s;ion, two events in the commencement of this reign; the trial of David Lind&s;ay of the Byres; and the maritime battles of Si$ Andrew Wood with the Engli&s;h. The partialities of Lind&s;ay the hi&s;torian appear to have amplified the&s;e incidents; while his circum&s;tantial narration confirms their general truth. The trial he a&s;cribes to a parliament, held on the tenth of May 1489, while no record exi&s;ts of any national council at that epoch: and he mentions that twenty eight lords, and as many great barons, were then &s;ummoned to an&s;wer for their adherence to James III; a circum&s;tance palbably romantic. It would &s;eem that David Lind&s;ay had engaged in the confederacy with Forbes and Lennox; and that he was tried this year, but acquitted by an imperfection in the indictment. For the particulars, which are detailed with native &s;implicity, the original work mentioned
<PB N="13" REF="19">may be con&s;ulted; as their minutene&s;s, connected with no great event, is unfit for hi&s;torical narration<NOTE N="9" PLACE="foot">Lind&s;ay, 150&mdash;155. The parliament of Jan. 1489 might have formed a &s;e&s;&s;ion of ju&s;tice in May: and it certainly deprived David Lind&s;ay, earl of Crawford, of two lord&s;hips, granted to him by James III. Carm. 75. Some &s;uch &s;evere proceedings may have &s;timulated the rebellion of 1489, which Craw|ford not joining, he was rewarded by the recognizance of his title of duke of Montro&s;e.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>It has already been ob&s;erved that, in the year 1486, a truce of three years had been concluded with England and the in|denture of the heralds, in 1487, for a la&s;ting peace, being annulled by the &s;ub&s;equent events, the expiration of the truce mu&s;t be a&s;&s;igned to the month of July 1489: nor does any further treaty appear till December 1491; though the Scoti&s;h act of parliament above adduced, implies that a truce exi&s;ted in February 1490<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Rymer, XII, 434, gives a permi&s;&s;ion by Henry to Knowles prior of St. John, to trade with one &s;hip, for one year, if the truce with Scotland la&s;t &s;o long: 21 Dec. 1490.

In &s;uch uncertainty it has appeared pre|ferable to abide by the po&s;itive date a&s;&s;igned by Buchanan, who places the chief action of Wood on the tenth of Augu&s;t, fourteen hundred and ninety<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Lind&s;ay, 155&mdash;159 dates both the actions in 1489. Buchanan, XIII, 2, 3, a&s;cribes the fir&s;t to 1488, and XIII, 6, the &s;econd to 1490. This di&s;crepance of the accounts, yet their general &s;imilarity, and the fixed epoch a&s;&s;igned by the latter hi&s;torian, concur to evince the veracity of the facts.
<P>Of the 14th May 1491 appears a charter, wherein James, con&s;idering the damage done to his &s;ubjects at &s;ea by the Engli&s;h and Dutch, grants the i&s;le of Inchgarvey, between the Queen's ferries, to John Dundas of Dundas, to build a <HI>fortalice</HI> thereon; with the con&s;tabulary thereof, and the duties on &s;hips pa&s;&s;ing. Scot&s;t. Cal. But Dundas neglected the affair; and it was not till about 1510, as will afterwards be &s;een, that James erected the fort.</P></NOTE>. The &s;ilence of the Engli&s;h annali&s;ts,
<PB N="14" REF="20">concerning the&s;e maritime affairs, will excite little he&s;itation with tho&s;e who know the lame and meagre information, pre|&s;ented by the original hi&s;torians of England at this period.</P>
<P>The barrenne&s;s of naval tran&s;actions in the Scoti&s;h hi&s;tory renders the deeds of Wood not a little &s;ingular, and intere&s;ting; for which rea&s;on the minute relation of Lind&s;ay &s;hall be fol|lowed. Five Engli&s;h ve&s;&s;els having entered the Forth, de|&s;poiled &s;ome mercantile &s;hips belonging to Scotland, and her allies. James and his council, irritated by the indignity, ea|gerly de&s;ired revenge, but could not prevail upon any ma&s;ters of ve&s;&s;els to proceed again&s;t the enemy, till they applied to Sir Andrew Wood of Largo, whom they incited by large offers of men and artillery, of royal favours and rewards. Being furni&s;hed with an ample provi&s;ion of men, cannon, and arms, Wood proceeded with his two &s;hips, the Flower, and the Yellow Carvel, again&s;t the Engli&s;h, who were al&s;o not defi|cient in artillery; and finding them oppo&s;ite to Dunbar, an ob&s;tinate and &s;anguinary conflict en&s;ued. Wood's extreme courage, and naval &s;kill, at length procured the victory: the five Engli&s;h ve&s;&s;els were taken, and brought to Leith; the commander pre&s;ented to the king and council. The &s;pirit and conduct of Wood were recompen&s;ed by honourable rewards, by the favour of James and the nobles, and by the loud voice of public fame.</P>
<P>Henry VII, concerned at the unu&s;ual di&s;grace of the Engli&s;h flag, inflicted by a power unknown in the annals of the &s;ea, offered a large yearly &s;um to any commander who &s;hould cap|ture Wood. But the &s;kill, valour, and fortune of the Scoti&s;h leader were now &s;o celebrated, that fear repre&s;&s;ed avarice. At length Stephen Bull, an Engli&s;h officer, engaged to &s;eize Wood dead or alive; and was provided with three &s;tout &s;hips com|pletely equipped for war. Bull pa&s;&s;ing to the Forth, anchored
<PB N="15" REF="21">behind the i&s;le of May; where he awaited the return of Wood, who had e&s;corted &s;ome merchant ve&s;&s;els to Flanders, expecting. that peace was e&s;tabli&s;hed. The Engli&s;h captain &s;eized &s;ome fi&s;hing boats, and retained the mariners, that by their informa|tion he might not mi&s;take his object. On a &s;ummer-morn,<NOTE PLACE="marg">10 Aug.</NOTE> a little after dawn, one of the Engli&s;h &s;hip-ma&s;ters de&s;cried two ve&s;&s;els coming under &s;ail, by St. Ebbs Head: the pri&s;oners were ordered to the tops, that they might declare whether the&s;e ve&s;&s;els were Wood's, or not; and, upon their he&s;itation, freedom being offered in ca&s;e this was the expected prey, they announced the Scoti&s;h admiral. Bull, with the exultation, of Engli&s;h courage, ordered the preparations for battle; and, after di&s;tributing wine and chearfulne&s;s, commanded all to their &s;tations. Wood advanced, uncon&s;cious of foes, till he perceived the three &s;hips under &s;ail, and attired for combat. He in&s;tantly prepared, and addre&s;&s;ed his men in the plain and boi&s;terous phra&s;e of the &s;ea: "The&s;e, my lads, are the foes, who expect to convey us in bonds to the Engli&s;h king: but by your courage, and the help of God, they &s;hall fail. Set your&s;elves in order, every man to his &s;tation. Charge gunners: let the cro&s;s-bows be ready: have the lime-pots, and fire-balls, to the tops: two handed &s;words to the fore-rooms. Be &s;tout, be diligent, for your own &s;akes, and for the honour of this realm." Wine was then dealed around; and the &s;hips re&s;ounded with acclamations.</P>
<P>The &s;un, now above the horizon, &s;hone full upon the Engli&s;h ve&s;&s;els, and di&s;played their magnitude and force to the eyes of the Scots, with a dazzling and enlarged appearance. Wood &s;kilfully attained the wind-ward of the foe; and engaged in a clo&s;e combat, which continued undecide from morning till night, while crowds of &s;pectators, a&s;&s;embling on the coa&s;t of Fife, expre&s;&s;ed by their ge&s;tures and voice, their alternate hopes and fears. During the night the combatants lay by to
<PB N="16" REF="22">refre&s;h and refit: at the dawn of day the trumpets again &s;um|moned them to arms. The battle continued &s;o ob&s;tinate, that the neglected ve&s;&s;els drove before an ebb-tide, and &s;outh wind, till they were oppo&s;ite to the mouth of the Tay. At length the valour and &s;eaman&s;hip of Wood prevailed: the three Eng|li&s;h &s;hips were captured, and brought to Dundee, where the wounded were properly tended. Wood pre&s;ented Bull to the Scoti&s;h monarch, and was rewarded as &s;uch eminent &s;ervices merited. James gave a &s;pecimen of his future regal &s;pirit by be&s;towing gifts upon the Engli&s;h commander, and his people; and &s;ending them and their &s;hips as a pre&s;ent to their &s;overeign; whom he at the &s;ame time informed that Scotland could al&s;o boa&s;t of warlike &s;ons both by &s;ea and land; and therefore de|&s;ired that Henry would no more in&s;ult the Scoti&s;h &s;eas, el&s;e a different fate &s;hould await the intruders. Henry murmured thanks, and di&s;&s;embled.</P>
<P>The Engli&s;h king,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1491</NOTE> who&s;e pacific policy was aware of the advantages to ari&s;e from a la&s;ting amity with Scotland, had already formed the de&s;ign, which by per&s;everance he accom|pli&s;hed, of uniting James with an Engli&s;h prince&s;s. It was apparently with a &s;ole view to the &s;ecurity of this &s;cheme that Henry now entered into a di&s;graceful negotiation. John lord Bothwell a favourite of James III, and Sir Thomas Tod of Sere&s;haw one of that king's &s;ervants, &s;ub&s;cribed an engage|ment at Greenwich,<NOTE PLACE="marg">16 April</NOTE> for them&s;elves, and James earl of Bu|chan uncle to the late Scoti&s;h king, importing that they &s;hould bring, and deliver into the hands of Henry, the king of Scots then reigning, and his &s;econd brother the duke of Ro&s;s: in expectation of which &s;ervice Henry's avarice advances a &s;mall &s;um of money<NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">Rymer, XII, 440. The &s;um was 266 <ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> 13 <ABBR><HI>s.</HI></ABBR> 4 <ABBR><HI>d.</HI></ABBR> which is mentioned to $$$iate the &s;trange inaccuracy of Abercromby and Guthrie. It amounts to Scol. Scoti&s;h, that money being then to the Engli&s;h as one to three.
<P>A curious original letter occurs in Cal. B. III, f. 19. of this or the pre|ceding year. It is from the <HI>Ma&s;ter</HI> of Huntley to Henry VII, and is dated 8th January. The writer reque&s;ts Henry to remember the &s;laughter of James, by a part of his fal&s;e and untrue lieges, as that monarch "&s;tood in near ten|derne&s;s of blood to your highne&s;s;" and to join and a&s;&s;i&s;t the lords in revenge.

<P>Another parliament having met,<NOTE PLACE="marg">18 May</NOTE> it was ordained that the alliance with France &s;hould be renewed<NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">Acts, f. 90. Du Tillet &s;tates a renewal by James on the 4th of March 1492: fol. 149, edit.

Within a month after, the Engli&s;h court granted a pa&s;sport for this emba&s;&s;y, which was al&s;o to proceed to Spain: but Henry pro|bably by pre&s;ents to Home, or others in the Scoti&s;h mini&s;try, per&s;i&s;ted to fru&s;trate the intentions of marriage. Some of our writers affect to con&s;ider a papal interdict again&s;t Scotland, as the cau&s;e that the emba&s;&s;ies repeatedly propo&s;ed had not been executed; but the pope's cen&s;ures did not extend to the king, or kingdom, as appears from the ab&s;olving re&s;cript of Inno|cent VIII, &s;oon to be noticed: the arts of Henry may there|fore be regarded as the cau&s;e of delay; and again&s;t them the Scoti&s;h parliament could not provide, though centainly too wi&s;e to order emba&s;&s;ies which could not be effected. A treaty
<PB N="18" REF="24">with Denmark was al&s;o again decreed. The days of truce, and warden courts, were ordered to be held in regular ob|&s;ervance: &s;o that a truce &s;till exi&s;ted with England; and it is to be &s;u&s;pected that the maritime actions of Wood were only exerted again&s;t pirates.</P>

The very conflicts of &s;ome writers again&s;t &s;uch ordinances prove their &s;pirit, and values; and a degree of bigotry mu&s;t be required, not to perceive the preeminence of the legi&s;lative power above the executive.</P>
<P>The Scoti&s;h parliaments are &s;oon to become more rare, and le&s;s worthy of hi&s;torical commemoration: a few further no|tices &s;hall therefore be extracted from the acts of the pre&s;ent national council. In the burghs, the objects of great attention to a friend of freedom, all leagues are prohibited, and no burge&s;s is allowed to ride in warlike attire, except with the king or the legal officers; regulations concerning the due ma|nagement of their revenues are al&s;o in&s;tituted. To provide a proper public force, it is decreed that regular <HI>weapon-&s;chawings,</HI> or di&s;plays of arms, be held four times in the year; and the different armour of each rank, and the penalties of failure are di&s;tinctly &s;pecified. The yeomen, from the age of &s;ixteen to that of &s;ixty, are among other weapons to bear the quiver and the bow; but the&s;e in&s;truments were to continue the pride of England, and the fatal neglect of Scotland.</P>

<P>The national council, with a laudable care, protected the privileges of the Scoti&s;h church, and endeavoured to pre&s;erve its independency from the encroachments of the Roman court. The foreign di&s;po&s;al of elective benefices was annulled; and the immunities of the &s;ees of St. Andrews, and of Gla&s;gow, which, a few years before, had been erected into an arch|bi&s;hopric<NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">As decreed in parliament Jan. 1489, Carm. 75, and ratified by Inno|cent VIII, 1491.

The rival archibi&s;hops had brought a plea before the pope concerning their juri&s;dictions; and it was apprehended that the one or the other party might renounce his immunities, to win the papal favour: the par|liament therefore de&s;ired the king to interfere, by &s;eizing the temporalities of the di&s;cordant prelates, in ca&s;e they refu&s;ed to &s;ubmit to an amicable dome&s;tic deci&s;ion: and a further pu|ni&s;hment
<PB N="21" REF="27">was held out, if they violated at Rome any &s;tatute of the realm, or privilege of the Scoti&s;h church. By &s;ome new and remarkable cu&s;tom, many proce&s;&s;es, even of laics, were dependent at Rome by appeals from the eccle&s;ia&s;tical courts: the three e&s;tates recommended to James to command the parties, by his emba&s;&s;adors, to return, and &s;ubmit their &s;uits to their ordinaries, or other competent judges. Benefices were guarded from papal exactions: and the former law was revived which prohibited any per&s;on from appearing as legate in Scotland, except he were a native, or had attained the rank of cardinal<NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">Many of the eccle&s;ia&s;tic immunities had been ordained by James I, "of mai&s;t noble mind," and emphatic expre&s;&s;ion, like the <HI>Menti Laudandae</HI> on the coins of Pertinax.

<P>The&s;e ordinances expre&s;s dignity and &s;pirit; nor was the prudence of tho&s;e concerning temporal affairs le&s;s con&s;picuous. Different &s;tatutes were enacted for the regulation of manu|factures and commerce: and a large and formal revocation was made of all alienations of royal property &s;ince the &s;econd day of September, in the year fourteen hundred, and eighty-&s;even; the king having now attained the complete age of twenty-one years. One of the mo&s;t memorable acts of this parliament regards that neglected mine of wealth, the fi&s;hery, an object &s;till in its infancy after an elap&s;e of three centuries: the importance of this decree may well excu&s;e its in&s;ertion in modern orthography, but with much of its antique &s;implicity. "Concerning the great innumerable riches, which are lo&s;t, for want of &s;hips, and <HI>bu&s;&s;es,</HI> to be employed in fi&s;hing, as other realms have, that border on the &s;ea; and for the advan|tages of <HI>police,</HI> and wealth, to be attained by this mean, and the employment of idlers and vagabonds, who might thus la|bour
<PB N="22" REF="28">for their livelihood, and for the common profit, and uni|ver&s;al good of the realm, it is thought expedient by the lords of the articles, and ordained in this parliament, that there be &s;hips and bu&s;&s;es made in, (or furni&s;hed by,) all burghs and towns, within this realm; and that the lea&s;t of the &s;aid &s;hips and bu&s;&s;es be of twenty tons. That the&s;e ve&s;&s;els be furni&s;hed according to the wealth of each town, in the number after mentioned<NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot">This number unhappily does not appear.</NOTE>; be well equipped with all nece&s;&s;aries, with ma|riners, nets, and proper in&s;truments for taking large fi&s;h and &s;mall; and be ready to pa&s;s to the fi&s;hery by &s;hrove-tue&s;day next.

Such is this remarkable &s;tatute; which, notwith&s;tanding its &s;trength, appears to have produced no effect.</P>
<P>Except &s;ome minute negotiations with England,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1494 13 June</NOTE> no inci|dent worth mention ari&s;es till the appearance of another par|liament<NOTE N="7" PLACE="foot">Ibid. f. v. 100. Granger, cont. of Maitland, II, 716, a&s;cribes the acts of this parliament to 1496; but the edition called the Black Acts is far from infallible in its dates. Murray of Glendook, f. 95, a&s;cribes this parliament to 1494. Carmichael's Tracts indicate no parliament of 1496: Abereromby, II, 500, abides by 1494. Le&s;ley, 333, a&s;&s;igns the famous &s;tatute of education to 1493.</NOTE>; after which, from whatever cau&s;e, none of the&s;e a&s;&s;emblies occur for the &s;pace of eight years. The laws concerning benefices were confirmed, and enlarged: and the exorbitant prices, charged by the craft&s;men, were ordered to be reduced upon a due con&s;ideration of the value of materials,
<PB N="23" REF="29">and the price of provi&s;ions. This parliament derives &s;ingular honour from the celebrated &s;tatute concerning education, which is of the following purport. "It is ordained through all the realm that all barons, and &s;ub&s;tantial freeholders, put their elde&s;t &s;ons and heirs, to the &s;chools, at the age of &s;ix, or at the utmo&s;t nine years; who are to remain at the grammar &s;chools, till they have a competent foundation, and good &s;kill in latin. After which they are to &s;tudy three years in the &s;chools of arts and laws: &s;o that they may have knowledge in the laws, and by this mean ju&s;tice be di&s;tributed through all the realm: tho&s;e who become &s;heriffs, or judges ordinary, having proper under&s;tanding, and the poor being under no nece&s;&s;ity of re|cour&s;e to high courts for every &s;mall injury. Any baron, or freeholder, failing without ju&s;t cau&s;e, is to incur a penalty of twenty pounds<NOTE N="8" PLACE="foot">Acts, f. 101.</NOTE>." This act appears to have contributed to|wards the advancement of learning in Scotland, which the invention of printing now di&s;&s;eminated quickly over Europe: the names of bi&s;hop Elphin&s;ton and Gawin Douglas honour this period; but any further con&s;ideration of the &s;ubject is re|&s;erved for a &s;ub&s;equent divi&s;ion of this work.</P>
<P>Meanwhile the &s;tate of Scotland was not a little pro&s;perous. Free from foreign war, and ble&s;&s;ed with a degree of internal tranquillity long unknown, the king, the nobles, the people, were united in mutual attachment and confidence. The libe|rality of James formed a plea&s;ing contra&s;t to the &s;ordid di&s;po|&s;ition of his father: and, in&s;tead of mean favourites the &s;courges of the people, his court was crouded with faithful peers, who&s;e hereditary wealth at lea&s;t exempted them from the ba&s;ene&s;s of avarice, and the atrocity of vulgar oppre&s;&s;ion. Their rank was founded upon honour; and honour may often &s;upply the
<PB N="24" REF="30">defect of virtue, while con&s;cious vilene&s;s &s;toops to every crime. The favour, and attention, of the &s;overeign, were equalled by the affection, and duty, of the nobles; who, from proud po|tentates, became loyal courtiers. To encourage this reforma|tion, now gradually advancing with the progre&s;s of refinement, the magnificence of James e&s;tabli&s;hed frequent tournaments; in which the arms of warlike peers, often in former times the terror of the monarch, were now exhibited for his amu&s;ement. The young king, him&s;elf eminent in arms, and inflamed with the &s;pirit of chivalry, and love of glory, delighted to behold and to reward martial &s;kill. He repeatedly invited by pro|clamation the earls, barons, and knights, to tournaments, and other warlike exerci&s;es; and at the appointed place, which was generally Edinburgh the capital city, &s;ome ran with &s;pears, others fought with the battle-ax, others with two handed &s;words; while &s;ome &s;hot at marks with the bow, cro&s;s-bow, or culverin. In whatever weapon each victor excelled, he received one of the &s;ame kind richly ornamented; and the heralds proclaimed his merit amid &s;houts of applau&s;e. The voice of chivarly refounded over Europe the fame of the Scoti&s;h court: and many an errant knight came from di&s;tant countries, to engage in this theatre of renown<NOTE N="9" PLACE="foot">Lindfay, 159, 160.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Nor was James le&s;s popular among the nation at large, who e&s;teemed his regal &s;pirit; and loved his amiable appearance, and qualities, and even his wildne&s;s of youth. Sometimes he would travel, di&s;gui&s;ed and unknown, through a great part of his kingdom, and lodge in the hovels of the poor; where he would provoke the voice of truth, &s;o odious to royal ears, by que&s;tions concerning his own character, and conduct, with|out any dread or anxiety at thus learning his reputation from
<PB N="25" REF="31">the univer&s;al voice. In the&s;e rambles he di&s;dained not to &s;hew his knowledge of medicine, and &s;urgery; in which arts the rudene&s;s of his kingdom afforded no &s;uperior.<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Lind&s;ay, 159, 162. Buch. XIII, 42.</NOTE> He had all that love of mu&s;ic, poetry, and the arts and &s;ciences in general, which was hereditary in the hou&s;e of Stuart. From a curio&s;ity, inherent to &s;uch a laudable di&s;po&s;ition, he cau&s;ed a human mon&s;ter, born in his dominions with a duplicate body above the wai&s;t, to be taught many languages, with mu&s;ic, and &s;ing|ing; &s;o that it could perform both treble and tenor at once. To make &s;ome dicovery on the origin of language, two in|fants under the charge of a dumb woman were &s;ent into the i&s;le of Inch Keith: but the &s;elf-taught &s;peech has not been explained; and it is needle&s;s to add that it mu&s;t have been orginal, and perhaps though there was &s;ome &s;ociety, little &s;uperior to the bruti&s;h babble of tho&s;e unfortunate beings, lo&s;t during their infancy in exten&s;ive fore&s;ts<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Id. 160, 162.

<P>The youthful and vague amours of James rendere him little de&s;irous of a &s;peedy marriage;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1495</NOTE> and his &s;pirit of chivalry was to plunge his kingdom into two impolitic, and unnece&s;&s;ary, wars with England; the latter of which received a dreadful expiation in his blood, and that of mo&s;t of his nobles. A ne|gotiation was apparently now at i&s;&s;ue between James, and the high-&s;pirited duche&s;s dowager of Burgundy, &s;i&s;ter of Edward IV, who, with the female arts afterwards &s;ucce&s;sfully practi&s;ed by the French queen, appealed to the knighthood of the Scoti&s;h &s;overeign, in defence of the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed. It is mo&s;t probable
<PB N="26" REF="32">that gold was al&s;o effectual, in exciting James to the romantic de&s;ign of rai&s;ing Perkin Warbec, or Richard duke of York &s;on of Edward IV, to the Engli&s;h throne. Anxious to prevent this treaty,<NOTE PLACE="marg">June</NOTE> Henry VII appointed commi&s;&s;ioners, not only to prolong the truce with James during their lives, but to offer his infant daughter Margaret, now only &s;ix years of age, in marriage to the king of Scotland<NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">Rymer, XII, 572. In March Henry had i&s;&s;ued a commi&s;&s;ion to SURREY, to array the northern counties again&s;t any attempt of his enemies <HI>from Scotland er other parts,</HI> ib. 568; but it appears not that Henry yet expected that James would a&s;&s;i&s;t Warbeck.</NOTE>. This propo&s;al was neg|lected: and it was little probable that James &s;hould wait for &s;o immature a bride; but, eight years afterwards, this event took place, to the &s;urprize and la&s;ting advantage of both kingdoms.</P>
<P>The &s;tory of Perkin Warbec,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1496</NOTE> or Richard duke of York, is &s;o well known that it is unnece&s;&s;ary to expatiate on a &s;ubject more properly belonging to Engli&s;h hi&s;tory; nor &s;hall any di&s;cu&s;&s;ion be here attempted of the arguments for, and again&s;t, his being the real &s;on of Edward IV. It is particularly un|nece&s;&s;ary to make an excur&s;ion from the hi&s;tory of Scotland, in &s;earch of difficulties; and it &s;hall &s;uffice to commence with the arrival of Perkin at the court of James, which happened this year. The pretender brought letters of powerful recom|mendation from Charles VIII of France, and from Maximi|lian king of the Romans. Attended by an opulent equipage, and honourable train of foreigners, his maje&s;tic elegance of per&s;on, and manners, con&s;pired to &s;ecure the favour of a youth|ful &s;overeign, warmly open to the impre&s;&s;ions of external &s;plendor. Perkin repre&s;ented him&s;elf as the &s;econd &s;on of Edward IV, whom the remor&s;e of a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins, &s;ated with the blood of his elder brother, had permitted, and a&s;&s;i&s;ted, to
<PB N="27" REF="33">e&s;cape to the continent. Sen&s;ible of the truth of his report, or mi&s;led by appearance, or de&s;irous to increa&s;e the importance and danger of a pretended rival to the Engli&s;h king, James a&s;&s;igned to Perkin in marriage the lady Catherine Gordon, daughter of the earl of Huntley; who united to her connection with the royal blood the prai&s;e of eminent merit, and beauty<NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">Le&s;l. 335.

<P>The mo&s;t curious, and authentic, intelligence concerning the preparations of James in &s;upport of Warbec, may be found in two original letters to Henry VII, from a &s;py whom he employed in the Scoti&s;h court.

James had required Perkin to deliver up Berwick, and the &s;even &s;heriffdoms<NOTE N="7" PLACE="foot">Their names are unmentioned.</NOTE>; and to pay, within five years after his e&s;tabli&s;hment on the throne, the &s;um of one hundred thou&s;and marks.

<P>Such are the&s;e &s;ingular letters, which it mu&s;t be remembered are written by a violent enemy of James.</P>
<P>Though the &s;ea&s;on was far advanced, James re&s;olved to avail him&s;elf of the fir&s;t impre&s;&s;ions; and to try the di&s;po&s;ition of the Engli&s;h in favour of the candidate for the crown. With this view he rai&s;ed a con&s;iderable force, and entered Northum|berland; where Perkin i&s;&s;ued a manife&s;to, offering deliverance from tyranny, and genral amne&s;ty, to his pre&s;umed &s;ubjects, with a high reward for the capture, or &s;laughter, of Henry Tudor. But the Engli&s;h were completely &s;atiated with civil wars; and refu&s;ed to join the dangerous &s;tandard of an antient foe, and of a dubious prince. The Scoti&s;h king, &s;atisfied with having &s;hewn the candidate to his people, and to fortune, was convinced that the &s;cheme was hopele&s;s; and became irritated by the failure of his de&s;ign. In revenge, he plundered the coutry, or laid it under contribution. Perkin, either from ju&s;t feelings, or ju&s;t di&s;&s;imulation, eagerly interfered, remon&s;trating that he would not de&s;ire even to &s;ecure the crown, at the expence of the blood, and wealth, of his people. James retorted with a &s;neer, "You are too careful of a nation, which acknowledges you neither for a king nor a &s;ubject; and which is wholly devoted to your chief enemy."

<P>Such was this remarkable treaty, which bears te&s;timony in &s;ome clau&s;es to the arts and avarice of Henry VII. In 1474, when money was perhaps more valuable, Edward IV had a&s;&s;igned twenty thou&s;and marks as the portion of his daughter, upon her marriage with the prince of Scotland; and Henry allows only fifteen thou&s;and marks, each angel-noble being worth but half a mark, upon a connubial alliance with the Scoti&s;h monarch. This will appear the more remarkable, when we con&s;ider that James is bound to renounce all claim to Berwick: and it mu&s;t be concluded that the gold of England influenced the Scoti&s;h mini&s;try and emba&s;&s;y. But the avarice of Henry, ab&s;urdly and impoliticly di&s;played in &s;uch a critical affair, defeated its own purpo&s;es. Had Berwick been re&s;tored to Scotland, to which country from its &s;ituation on the northern &s;hore of the Tweed, and from long po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion it properly be|longs; and had the portion of Margaret been more worthy of an Engli&s;h prince&s;s, wedded to a king; neither injured pride, nor penurious finances, might have &s;timulated James to violate the peace, and to return to the ruinous connection with France.</P>

<P>Thus was a pacification e&s;tabli&s;hed between England and Scotland, being the fir&s;t &s;ince the year 1332, when Edward III infringed that concluded with Robert I. The nations had &s;uffered one hundred and &s;eventy years of wars, and dubious truces. Untaught by experience, they were again, in the cour&s;e of then years, to re&s;ume their antient enmity. It was re&s;erved till the age of Elizabeth for the Engli&s;h monarchs to &s;ecure an influence in Scotland, &s;ufficient to counterbalance, and over|come, that of France; and this influence was greatly indebted to the prote&s;tant faith. Centuries of di&s;appointment had elap&s;ed before England di&s;covered how much the arts of policy are &s;uperior to force, and as in the&s;e France excelled, it is no wonder that her influence long preponderated. Nor need it
<PB N="44" REF="50">be di&s;gui&s;ed, in an age when patrioti&s;m is a &s;pecies of mer|chandize, that half the &s;ums expended by England in war might have &s;ecured a perpetual peace: for &s;uch are men, that they mu&s;t often be corrupted, before they will pur&s;ue their own political de&s;ires, their own intere&s;ts, and tho&s;e of their country.</P>

<P>At length, after a number of tedious formalities, the royal bride, now in her fourteenth year, proceeded to Scotland, and, by a &s;pecial favour, rather before the time affixed. Her father accompanied her from the palace of Richmond to Colliwe&s;ton, in Northampton&s;hire; where he delivered her to the care of the earl of Surrey, who, with a noble and magnificent retinue, attended her journey, and was to pre&s;ent a b$ooming bride to James, whom he afterwards defeated and &s;lew. In their pro|gre&s;s they were met by the archbi&s;hop of York, the bi&s;hop of Durham, Northumberland, Dacre, and other peers, who ac|companied the cavalcade to Lambertonkirk, a place a little to the north of Berwick.

Arthur, and his knights of the round table, &s;o familiar to the latter ages of chivalrous fable, al&s;o adorned the li&s;ts with their ideal per&s;onages. The &s;olemnity of this marriage had been appointed &s;o long before, that even foreigners attended the fe&s;tival: and among the&s;e was di&s;tingui&s;hed a French knight, Anthony D'arcy de la Ba&s;tie, who was afterwards warden of the marches of Scotland, till he met with a cruel fate<NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">Drummond, 133.

<P>Among the numerous &s;tatutes of this celebrated parliament,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1504</NOTE> the mo&s;t intere&s;ting are tho&s;e calculated to di&s;&s;ipate the bar|bari&s;m of the highlands and i&s;les. John, lord of the I&s;les, had been deprived of the earldom of Ro&s;s in the year 1476, as be|fore related, and that earldom was irrecoverably annexed to the crown: but, in 1480, that de&s;pot had entered into negotiations with England, and was fummoned by the Scoti&s;h parliament to an&s;wer for his conduct. The &s;ucceeding commotions of the weak reign of James III prevented any further procedure: but James IV was no &s;ooner arrived at complete majority, and capable of revoking any imprudent conce&s;&s;ion of his father, than a forfeiture of the I&s;les was i&s;&s;ued again&s;t John, as appears from many charters under the great &s;eal, between the years from many charters under the great &s;eal, between the years 1490 and 1498<NOTE N="7" PLACE="foot">Scot&s;t.

That the ju&s;tices and &s;heriffs of the northern i&s;les have their courts at Inverne&s;s, or at Dingwall, as the &s;ituation of the &s;uit, and parties, may demand: and that another ju&s;tice or &s;heriff be appointed for the &s;outhern i&s;les, and neighbouring region, who&s;e court &s;hall be held in the Tarbat of Loch Kinderan, upon every due occa&s;ion<NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">Campbell-town afterwards aro&s;e upon the &s;pot.</NOTE>." The next act decrees that tho&s;e parts of the highlands called Dowart and Glentowart, lying between Lorn and Badenoch, and the lord&s;hip of Lorn, all which had been unaccu&s;tomed to acknow|ledge any courts of ju&s;tice, &s;hould atten tho&s;e held at Perth: that, of the other parts, Argyle, Mawmor, and Lochaber, which were in the like predicament, the two latter &s;hould fol|low the courts of Inverne&s;s, the former tho&s;e of Perth, where ju&s;tice was to be admini&s;tered in &s;uits between highlanders and lowlanders, and where a &s;pecial judge for Argyle was to re|&s;ide. The inhabitants of part of Cowal, not comprehended in Argyle, were to attend at Dunbarton: and tho&s;e of Knapdale and Kintyre were to join the people of Bute, Arran, and Cumbra, in their attendance at Air or Roth&s;ay. By another &s;tatute<NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">Acts, f. 106, c. 114; c. 79 in Murray's edition.</NOTE> it is ordained that all the &s;ubjects, and e&s;pecially tho&s;e
<PB N="49" REF="55">of the i&s;les, be ruled by the ordinances and common law of the realm, and by no other legi&s;lation. As the &s;heriffdom of Inverne&s;s had hitherto extended its juri&s;diction over Ro&s;s and Caithne&s;s, an impotent amplitude ari&s;ing from the inattention of the two latter provinces to legal admini&s;tration, a &s;heriff is appointed for Ro&s;s, to hold his courts in Tain or Dingwall; and another for Caithne&s;s to admini&s;ter ju&s;tice at Dornock or Wich<NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot">But not courts appear for Sutherland and Strathnavern, the wild north-we&s;t extremity of Scotland.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Such were the &s;tatutes formed to introduce law and order into the i&s;les and highlands; godlike efforts, and before which the triumphs of war &s;ink into contempt! The fir&s;t real acqui|&s;ition of the we&s;tern i&s;les, effected by the reigning monarch, excited attention not only to their political &s;ituation, but to that of the highlands, a great part of which had been &s;ubject to the lords of the i&s;les; and other portions to chiefs, who either affected a &s;avage independence, or from con&s;anguinity, friend&s;hip, protection, intere&s;t, or language, were led to regard the powerful &s;ucce&s;&s;ors of the in&s;ular kings as their only &s;ove|reigns. By the ruin therefore of that de&s;potic family not only the we&s;tern i&s;les, but the highlands, became for the fir&s;t time really &s;ubject to the Scoti&s;h government, as the above acts plainly evince. The acqui&s;ition of the Hebudes by Alexan|der III was that of the nominal &s;uperiority; the conque&s;t of Argely by Robert I was fugitive and vain.

But the patriotic efforts of this parliament had little influence over a deeply rooted barbari&s;m.

<P>Notwith&s;tanding the particularity with which the tran&s;ac|tions of this parliament have been con&s;idered, and for which their intere&s;ting nature affords a &s;ufficient apology, there yet remain three &s;tatutes which mu&s;t not be pa&s;t in &s;ilence.

<P>The nuptial treaty, and perpetual pacification, with England, appear to have been pa&s;&s;ed with a &s;ingular negligence, on the part of France. Louis XII, occupied &s;ucce&s;&s;ively with the wars of Milan and Naples, could expect little a&s;&s;i&s;tance from Scotland in &s;uch di&s;tant campaigns: and the di&s;po&s;ition of Henry VII afforded no rea&s;on for France to expect any ne|ce&s;&s;ity of the u&s;ual Scoti&s;h interference in a war with England. The new &s;cene of politics opened to France in the Italian wars, and the &s;ettled peace between that kingdom and Eng|land, &s;eem to have induced &s;uch neglect of her Scoti&s;h ally, that the confederation had not been renewed; nor, as appears, even an emba&s;&s;y &s;ent &s;ince the acce&s;&s;ion of Louis XII. Per|haps the amicable di&s;po&s;ition of James III towards England, and the dubious politics of his youthful &s;ucce&s;&s;or, contributed to this indifference: but at length Louis, having lo&s;t the king|dom of Naples, became &s;en&s;ible of the value of allies; and, to compen&s;ate his negligence, in this, or perhaps the preceding, year, &s;ent an emba&s;&s;ador of high rank and fame, Bernard Stuart

<P>The power of Scotland,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1506</NOTE> and her influence in the general concerns of Europe, were carried to a great extent, during this reign of an able and beloved monarch.

<P>The affairs of Sweden pre&s;ented another &s;phere of exertion to James. That kingdom, excited by the admini&s;trator Suanto Sture, was in a &s;tate of open rebellion again&s;t its Dani&s;h &s;ove|reigns. To protect the cau&s;e of his ally, John king of Den|mark Norway and Sweden, the Scoti&s;h monarch di&s;patched let|ters of conciliation to the archbi&s;hop of Up&s;al, and the Swedi&s;h &s;enate; and to the people of Lubeck, who were about to a&s;&s;i&s;t

The&s;e letters breathe the u&s;ual regal &s;pirit, but at the &s;ame time are models of elegance and force: they abound with &s;alutary maxims, and even pre&s;ent rude features of a re&s;pect for liberty. James allows that an unju&s;t king may be oppo&s;ed by recour&s;e to arms, provided that he had fir&s;t been warned, in a national council, to reform his errors, and had rejected the advice of his people. To lend more effectual aid to John, a Scoti&s;h &s;quadron &s;ailed to the Baltic; but returned without any achievement, as the &s;ucce&s;s of the Dani&s;h arms rendered the a&s;&s;i&s;tance at that time unnece&s;&s;ary<NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">Epi&s;t.

To &s;ave the di&s;grace of a reduction in his di&s;|bur&s;ements, he now projected a pilgrimage to the Holy Land; a de&s;ign congenial to his natural &s;uper&s;tition, which was in|crea&s;ed by his apparent guilt in the death of his father<NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot">See the clo&s;e of the epi&s;tle to O Donnel p. 64.

The ridicule of Dunbar the poet, who was him&s;elf a debauched &s;aint, te&s;tifies that the age was not &s;o rude, as to be in&s;en&s;ible of this incon|&s;i&s;tency<NOTE N="7" PLACE="foot">Le&s;ley, 344, 345, narrates the royal pilgrimages to St. Ninian's in Gallo|way, and St. Duthac's in Ro&s;s.

<P>The war between John king of Denmark,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1510</NOTE> and his Swedi&s;h &s;ubjects, &s;till continuing, the Hans Towns, finding their advan|tageous commerce with Sweden interrupted by the Dani&s;h cor&s;airs, entered into the conte&s;t in &s;upport of the Swedes.

The character of James had been well &s;tudied by La Motte, and was completely known by Forman, &s;o that it was now touched with a ma&s;terly hand; for letters, written in an amorous &s;train, appeared from a high-born dam&s;el in di&s;tre&s;s, the queen of France, to this prince of chivalry, in which &s;he termed him her knight; and, a&s;&s;uring him that &s;he had &s;uffered much blame in the defence of his honour, be&s;eeched him to advance but three &s;teps into Engli&s;h ground with his army, for the &s;ake of his mi&s;tre&s;s. The artful queen, Anne of Bretagne, who died a few years after in her thirty &s;eventh year, at the &s;ame time &s;ent to James fourteen thou&s;and crowns; and, what ought to have been more valuable to an errant knight, a ring from her own finger<NOTE N="9" PLACE="foot">Lind&s;ay, 171, 172.

Hence the reproaches of Anne, which refer to the inactivity of James, after the league of la&s;t year, and perhaps to the intervening negotiations with England; and hence the in&s;olent remon&s;trance, con|tained in a letter of Forman's at this period, in which he a&s;&s;ured his king that his honour was for ever lo&s;t, if he did not a&s;&s;i&s;t France, as Forman had promi&s;ed in his name<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Iidem ib.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>But there was another point of honour to be con&s;idered; for a defect in which the Engli&s;h warmly accu&s;ed James, though with no great degree of ju&s;tice. This was the rupture of the perpetual peace; to the ob&s;ervance of which both kings had &s;olemnly &s;worn. Yet there was nothing in that treaty exclu&s;ive of an alliance between Scotland and France; and
<PB N="88" REF="94">it was e&s;pecially agreed that either party might a&s;&s;i&s;t an ally again&s;t the other, provided there was no inva&s;ion permitted of each other's dominions: in their &s;ub&s;equent letters, James, and Henry, betrayed improper warmth; but the power, which fir&s;t radically infringed the perpetual peace, was that which fir&s;t invaded the territories of the other; and in this it is &s;u&s;|pected that James was to blame: for if any petty Engli&s;h in|va&s;ion preceded that by Home, as our hi&s;torians pretend, it might, like other limitary in&s;ults, have been revenged by let|ters of reprizal, in conformity to the grand pacification<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Arran's inva&s;ion of Ireland in July was confe&s;&s;edly unauthorized.</NOTE>.

To a candid enquirer the caprice, and haughtine&s;s, of Henry will appear as immediate a cau&s;e of the war, as the prevalence of the French intere&s;t at the Scoti&s;h court: James may well be acquitted of any criminal infringement of a conditional oath; but he mu&s;t be charged with ra&s;hne&s;s, and want of prudence. The conduct of Henry VII to him&s;elf &s;hould have been the example for that of James to his youthful brother-in-law; but the character of the Scoti&s;h monarch was unhappily as impetuous as that of his antagoni&s;t.</P>

<P>The Engli&s;h monarch received this bold epi&s;tle, while be|fore Terouenne,<NOTE PLACE="marg">11 Aug.</NOTE> the emperor Maximilian was about to &s;ight under his banner; and his youth was flu&s;hed with pride, ambi|tion, and glory<NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot">Herbert, 37.</NOTE>.

This retort little contributed to appea&s;e Henry's wrath; who &s;ent a letter full of indignities, which never reached the eye or ear of James, as the herald was not able to procure a pa&s;&s;age from Flanders, till after the death of his ma&s;ter<NOTE N="7" PLACE="foot">Le&s;l. ib.</NOTE>. The chief topies of reproach were, that James, with the per&s;idy of his ance&s;tors, intended to break the peace &s;olemnly &s;worn; that he had awaited Henry's ab&s;ence, before his intentions were declared; that his want of faith being known, England was prepared to receive him; that he ex|pected the crown of that kingdom, but Henry &s;hould &s;o order, that neither he, nor his de&s;cendants, &s;hould wear it. The Engli&s;h king &s;olemnly denies that he refu&s;ed a &s;afe-conduct to the emba&s;&s;ador: and rejects with di&s;dain, to admit James as the judge of his quarrel with France, or at his de&s;ire to de&s;i&s;t from the war<NOTE N="8" PLACE="foot">Rymer, XIII, 382.

<P>Henry certainly regarded the letter of James, and not un|ju&s;tly, as a declaration of war: but it is impo&s;&s;ible that an incur&s;ion could be made into Scotland, in con&s;equence of this letter, before the 13th of Augu&s;t, as &s;ome of our hi&s;torians pretend; and that &s;uch an inroad was at all effected &s;eems more than dubious. However this be, lord Home, who had a few years before &s;ucceeded his father as chamberlain of Scot|land, and was moreover warden of all the marches, arrayed
<PB N="94" REF="100">his followers to the amount of three or four thou&s;and,<NOTE PLACE="marg">13 Aug.</NOTE> marched into England, rifled and burned &s;even villages, or hamlets, on the borders; and collected con&s;iderable &s;poil<NOTE N="9" PLACE="foot">Le&s;l. 361.

The &s;ucce&s;s of Home was &s;peedily rever&s;ed.

<P>James, in oppo&s;ition to the advice of his council, had al|ready &s;ummoned the whole array of his kingdom, embracing every province, and even the i&s;les, to meet him at the Burrow|moor,

<P>Meanwhile the defeat of Home, who &s;eems to have been permitted to make his excur&s;ion during the gradual a&s;&s;emblage of the ho&s;t, with an erroneous view perhaps of in&s;piriting its hopes, by the previous pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s and plunder, not a little clouded the mind of the king<NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">Lind&s;ay, 172, &s;ays James was "very &s;ad and dolorous."</NOTE>. Some of his wi&s;er courtiers, knowing him as prone to &s;uper&s;tition as to romantic adventure, availed them&s;elves of his melancholy, to introduce a mode of di&s;&s;ua&s;ion from his intended expedition, only adapted to the man, and to the age. As James was performing his devotions in the church of Linlithgow, a grave per&s;onage, with a bald fore-head, blue gown, linen girdle, and &s;andals, probably repre&s;enting Saint Andrew, the patron of Scotland, preceeded boldly to the royal &s;eat; and, with the awful voice of cele&s;tial authority, warned the king of the deplorable fate of his expedition: nay, if we believe an eye-witne&s;s, this pretended vi&s;ion added a &s;tern caution again&s;t the king's at|tachment to vague amours, as leading to his certain ruin; a

Returning up the banks of the Tweed, James took the ca&s;tle of Wark, or Carram, &s;ituated above Cold&s;tream, on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the river; then proceeding to the &s;outh-ea&s;t, he ventured a few miles further into Engli&s;h ground, and took the ca&s;tles of Etal, and Ford; names before unknown, and enterprizes worthy of a border-chieftain<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Ibid.

From the&s;e, and other cau&s;es, the Scoti&s;h ho&s;t gradually melted away, till there remained not above thirty thou&s;and; a di&s;proportionate number of whom con&s;i&s;ted of lords and gentlemen, prevented by con|&s;iderations of honour from following the vulgar example<NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot">Lind&s;ay, 176, &s;ays there only remained ten thou&s;and, be&s;ides "borderers and <HI>countrymen,</HI>" that is men of the &s;outhern counties.

<P>James had altogether forgotten his characters of monarch, and general; and ru&s;hed on with the illaudable valour of a
<PB N="104" REF="110">common &s;oldier. While the Engli&s;h leaders, con&s;cious of their duty and importance, pre&s;erved a &s;tation, from which they could di&s;cern, and direct, the actions of their bands, James, and his nobles, di&s;mounted; and &s;truggled in the front with the ma&s;s of Engli&s;h bill-men. In this vain, and inglorious, conte&s;t many Scoti&s;h peers fell; but Bothwell and his re&s;erve advancing, and valiantly &s;upporting the king's attack, the &s;tandard of Surrey was endangered. At this critical moment that part of the left wing, which was led by Crawford and Montro&s;e, being routed, Huntley having fled, and Home's battalion being thus &s;eparated, and apparently obliged to &s;tand on the defen&s;ive again&s;t the cavalry under Dacre, the admiral advanced his divi&s;ion, and a&s;&s;ailed in flank that of the Scoti&s;h king, and the re&s;erve under Bothwell, which had bravely ad|vanced in his &s;upport. James fell amid heaps of his warlike peers, and gentlemen; being pierced with an arrow, and mortally wounded on the head with a bill. Though Stanley, having di&s;per&s;ed the right wing, now pur&s;ued their tract, and came upon the rear of the Scoti&s;h centre, it &s;till maintained the &s;hock; and, arranged in the form of a circle, di&s;puted the victory with &s;urrounding enemies, till the approach of night terminated the conflict.</P>
<P>As Home's band had defeated a part of the Engli&s;h army, and the Scoti&s;h centre had not retired, Surrey was uncertain of the victory, till the returning dawn di&s;covered that the field was abandoned by the foe<NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">Compare Hall's intere&s;ting detail with the more &s;ummary accounts of Lind|&s;ay, 182, 183; Buch.

<P>Such was the celebrated battle of Flodden, the only one in which a Scoti&s;h king had fallen, &s;ince the time of Malcom III.
<PB N="105" REF="111">The generous and valiant peers di&s;dained their lives, in the defence and revenge of their &s;overeign; and perhaps no con|flict in hi&s;tory di&s;plays &s;uch an effu&s;ion of noble blood. The archbi&s;hop of St. Andrews, a natural &s;on of James, who&s;e promi&s;ing youth was honoured with the eulogy of Era&s;mus, was a victim on this occa&s;ion, along with other church-men of rank, George Hepburn bi&s;hop of the I&s;les, and the abbots of Kilwinning and Inchaffray. Of the nobles were twelve earls; Crawford, Montro&s;e, Lennox, Argyle, Errol, Athole, Mor|ton, Ca&s;&s;ils, Bothwell, Rothes, Caithne&s;s, Glencairn; be&s;ides thirteen lords; and five elde&s;t &s;ons of peers. The gentlemen of high rank, and chiefs of families, amounted to about fifty. Of the common &s;ort it may be computed, by a&s;&s;uming the middle between the diminutions of the Scots and exaggerations of the Engli&s;h, that about ten thou&s;and were left on the field<NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot">In a tablet on the monument of Surrey, afterwards Norfolk, (Weaver's Fun. Mon.) the number is computed at 17,000. Polydore Virgil more ju&s;tly puts 10,000 Scots, and 5000 Engli&s;h. He re&s;ided in England, 1510&mdash;1550.</NOTE>. On the Engli&s;h &s;ide hardly a gentleman fell, for the battle was as u&s;ual chiefly decided by the Engli&s;h archers: but the lo&s;s of the &s;oldiery might amount to four thou&s;and.</P>
<P>In the night of the battle, Home's followers, chiefly free|booting borderers, pillaged &s;ome of the &s;lain; and their leader has been much calumniated by &s;ome Scoti&s;h hi&s;torians, as if he had &s;tood aloof, while he might have lent effectual aid to his &s;overeign; nay &s;ome charge him with the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination of James, when he had pa&s;&s;ed the Tweed, in his flight from the field. But the reports are &s;o vague, and contradictory, that they de|&s;erve no credit. The impartiality of the old Engli&s;h writers allows that Home's divi&s;ion di&s;per&s;ed that of his opponents; a merit a&s;cribed by our hi&s;torians to Huntley, who was among

Yet Polydore Virgil blames Home.</NOTE>. The Engli&s;h cavalry appear to have &s;epa|rated Home's divi&s;ion, and forced it to &s;tand on the defen&s;ive, till the conflict was nearly decided: perhaps the followers of that peer, who had &s;uffered &s;o much in the late ambu&s;cade, might think they had done their duty, and refu&s;e to renew the charge. It is impo&s;&s;ible to perceive from the pa&s;t, or &s;ub&s;e|quent, conduct of Home, what advantage he could hope from the death of a king, who highly favoured him and his family: but it is ea&s;y to di&s;cern that Home's power excited great jealou&s;y during the en&s;uing regency, and that his enemies ex|erted every art to blacken his character, before the regent was in&s;tigated to put him to death.</P>
<P>Surrey, contented with his victory, did not advance into Scotland. The body of James was di&s;covered by Dacre, and was carried to Berwick, where it was recognized by Sir Wil|liam Scot, and Sir John Forman, his confidential &s;ervants, who had remained captives. It was afterwards interred at Shene or Richmond, by the &s;pecial permi&s;&s;ion of Leo X, as James had died under a recent &s;entence of excommunication, for infringing the &s;olemn pacification with England<NOTE N="7" PLACE="foot">Hall, ib.

The fables of our hi&s;torians concern|ing the fate of James are beneath all notice. A curious anecdote, concerning the di&s;po&s;al of the body, may be found in Stow's Survey of London, p. 539, extracted by Sir David Dalrymple in his Remarks on S$. Hi&s;t. p. 152.

</ARGUMENT>
<P>NO event more immediately calamitous than the defeat at Flodden darkens the Scoti&s;h annals. Shrieks of de&s;pair re&s;ounded through the kingdom. Wives, mothers, daughters,
<PB N="109" REF="115">ru&s;hed into the &s;treets, and highways; tearing their hair, in|dulging all the di&s;traction of &s;orrow, while each invoked &s;ome favourite name, a hu&s;band, a &s;on, a father, a brother, a lover, now blended in one bloody ma&s;s of de&s;truction. While the plea&s;ing labours of harve&s;t were abandoned, while an awful &s;ilence reigned in the former &s;cenes of rural mirth, the ca&s;tle and the tower echoed to the lamentations of noble matrons and virgins; the churches and chapels were filled with me|lancholy proce&s;&s;ions, to deprecate the divine vengeance, and to chaunt with funereal mu&s;ic the ma&s;&s;es of the &s;lain. Nor, amid the pangs of private di&s;tre&s;s, was the monarch forgotten: the valiant, the affable, the great, the good; who, in an evil hour, had &s;acrificed to precipitation a reign of virtues; who in the vigour of his life had fallen in a foreign land, and who&s;e mangled body was the prey of his enemies. The national &s;orrow was heightened by terror at the &s;cene which &s;eemed ready to open, of &s;ervitude, and of ruin. France, it&s;elf en|dangered, could afford no aid: the Engli&s;h monarch might little regard the ties of blood, but might wre&s;t from his infant nephew a kingdom left defencele&s;s by the lo&s;s of its peers and be&s;t warriors. Even now the philo&s;opher, and the hi&s;torian, may regard this cri&s;is as the mo&s;t fatal which ever attacked the pro&s;perity of Scotland. The reign of James IV is allowed to have been the period of the highe&s;t national &s;ucce&s;s, and a &s;ummit, from which the public fortune was gradually to de|cline, till, in the pre&s;ent century, it again began to a&s;cend. The defeat at Flodden, the death of the king, left the country a prey to foreign influence and intrigue, which continued till Scotland cea&s;ed to form a &s;eparate kingdom: her finances were exhau&s;ted; her leaders corrupted; her dignity degraded; her commerce and her agriculture neglected. Henceforth her hi&s;toric page a&s;pires little to glory; but &s;till continues deeply
<PB N="110" REF="116">to intere&s;t by the peculiarity, and variety, and even by the tragical nature, of its events.</P>
<P>The fifth James was not a year and a half old at the time of his father's death<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">He was born <HI>about</HI> the 16th of April, as appears from a letter of Magnus, Cal. B. VI, f. 333, mentioning that at Ea&s;ter 1525 James would attain the age of thirteen. In the Epi&s;t. R. S. I, 142, date <HI>du$d$cimo</HI> as the MS. not <HI>undecimo;</HI> Ea&s;ter happened on the 11th of April, &s;o that the birth of James is fixed to the 10th of April 1512, by that letter, p. 141.</NOTE>. The long minority, about to be deli|neated, is remarkable for internal intrigue; and particularly for the fixed e&s;tabli&s;hment of the French and Engli&s;h factions in Scotland, which were to continue more or le&s;s to di&s;tract that ill-fated kingdom, till the clo&s;e of its exi&s;tence as a &s;epa|rate &s;tate. For many reigns preceding the tyrannic interfe|rence of Edward I, Scotland had been devoted to the Engli&s;h intere&s;t; and her kings, ignorant of the fabulous alliance with France, had regarded tho&s;e of England as brothers and friends. When Edward's ra&s;h policy, and de&s;tructive actions, had ruined all confidence, the connexion with France commenced: and though David II, and James I, di&s;covered &s;ome attachment to England, the peers and the nation may be regarded as con|&s;tantly blending their intere&s;ts with tho&s;e of France, and as being even blindly zealous for that country. The impolitic conduct of the Engli&s;h &s;overeigns had not a little contributed to this effect, by continual exa&s;peration, and frequent war. But on the dawn of more refined policy in the northern king|doms of Europe, they were at length to perceive that per&s;ua|&s;ion is more powerful than force; and that the &s;ums expended in fruitle&s;s war might be u&s;ed to real advantage, by the regular pay of a party, &s;o as to a&s;&s;ume the government of Scotland without the envy attached to open conque&s;t; or at lea&s;t to balance the &s;imilar arts of France, and, by dividing the coun|cils
<PB N="111" REF="117">and &s;trength of that &s;mall &s;tate, render its force ineffectual. The ambition of the emperor Charles V, the &s;pirit of the monarchs of France and England, Francis I and Henry VIII, now about to produce &s;ome of the mo&s;t important events in modern hi&s;tory, contribute to render the factious intrigues prevalent in Scotland at this period intere&s;ting, as connected with the general hi&s;tory of Europe. The abilities, and fame, of the actors al&s;o con&s;pire to render the &s;pectacle illu&s;trious. This new &s;cene is about to open on the reader with &s;ingular advantage: the motives, councils, events, and characters, being now, for the fir&s;t time, to be pourtrayed from the letters of the principal per&s;ons concerned; which are very numerous<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">They fill nearly &s;ix large folio volumes, in the Cotton Library, Caligula, B.

It is &s;till to be regretted that the arrangement is completely un|chronological.

<P>In the fatal battle of Flodden mo&s;t of the Scoti&s;h nobility had peri&s;hed, and the council which urgent nece&s;&s;ity &s;ummoned to Perth, may be &s;uppo&s;ed to have con&s;i&s;ted chiefly of the emi|nent clergy.

The Engli&s;h faction was yet to form; and the French began to murmur, and to think of the duke of Albany, John the &s;on of Alexander ba|ni&s;hed by his brother James III, and who was undoubtedly next heir to the monarchy, if the progeny of his cou&s;in James IV &s;hould fail. But this prince remaining in France was di&s;tant from their vows; and the recent example of Ri|chard III of England occa&s;ioned &s;ome terror at the pro&s;pect of committing royal children to the charge of their uncle. Nor would it have been prudent further to have irritated Henry VIII, by manife&s;ting any di&s;re&s;pect to his &s;i&s;ter at this cri&s;is; not to mention that the queen intere&s;ted the wi&s;hes of the people by her &s;ituation, being in the third month of her pregnancy, and, as it proved, of a &s;on, Alexander duke of Ro&s;s<NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot">Not Roth&s;ay, as &s;ome of our hi&s;torians, a title &s;acred to the elde&s;t &s;on of the monarch: the coeval letters unanimou&s;ly &s;tyle him Ro&s;s.</NOTE>, who was born in the following April, but died in his &s;econd year.</P>

Margaret was now in her twenty-fourth year; and her youthful beauty and graces rather proclaimed the bride, than the widow. Her circular countenance di&s;playing gaiety, her vivacious eyes, her per&s;on rather ru&s;tic than delicate, were accompanied with a corre&s;ponding vigour of health<NOTE N="7" PLACE="foot">A good whole length portrait exi&s;ts at Hampton-court.</NOTE> Her amorous propen&s;ities were &s;trong; and were to be indulged at

Yet the times were difficult; and that wi&s;dom could not be mean which attracted the prai&s;e of the able Dacre, of the prudent and magnanimous Surrey, and of the cautious cardinal<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">In various letters which pa&s;&s;ed among tho&s;e three eminent per&s;ons, to be found in the above collection.</NOTE>, a prai&s;e not to be &s;u&s;pected of flattery, becau&s;e neither pronounced nor known to the object.</P>
<P>The ari&s;tocracy of Scotland was at this time &s;o much di|mini&s;hed, and weakened, that the queen's attempt to gain the regency was not &s;o arduous, as it might have proved at another period. The peers, who amounted to about forty at the clo&s;e of the late reign, were now reduced to nearly half the number, by extinction or by nonage. In a meeting of the &s;tates, &s;ome time after this period<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Rymer, XIII, 509: 15 May 1515.</NOTE>, we only find the names of Angus, Argyle, Arran, Errol, Morton, Eglinton, Home, Sempil, Ro&s;s, Er&s;kine, and Ye&s;ter.

<P>Meanwhile the war with England continued to de&s;olate the Scoti&s;h borders.

The friend&s;hip of Francis I is it&s;elf a recommendation: yet an intimate acquaintance with the actions and papers of Albany may authorize the following character of his government.

A &s;tranger to the arts of empire, Albany, whom ju&s;t policy ought to have transformed into a complete Scoti&s;hman, never forgot his French birth; and the haughty vanity of that nation, which he di&s;played without a veil, yet further di&s;gu&s;ted the
<PB N="135" REF="141">Scots, a people then from remote &s;ituation, and want of in|tercour&s;e, inimical to foreigners, when they beheld their re|gent &s;urrounded with French officers and confidents, and heard him &s;ubmit to term the king of France his ma&s;ter, an epithet he frequently u&s;ed even in his di&s;patches<NOTE N="7" PLACE="foot">Cal.

Even his private faults contributed to di&s;grace him. Surrey, in a letter to Wol&s;ey, mentions upon the authority of Dacre, that the regent was &s;o opiniative, that no coun&s;el but his own was followed even when among his familiar friends; and his wil|fulne&s;s was &s;uch that, upon the &s;lighte&s;t contradiction, he would throw his bonnet into the fire, in which mode of argu|ment he had con&s;umed near a dozen of tho&s;e mi&s;&s;ive &s;yllogi&s;ms.

<P>Haughty and &s;evere mea&s;ures marked the commencement of Albany's government; and he re&s;olved to impre&s;s his ene|mies with terror, in&s;tead of winning them by conciliation, a method which his caprice was obliged afterwards to adopt, when it was too late, his preceding rigour having &s;own &s;eeds of an enmity, too wide and deep ever to be eradicated.

In vain did the queen, to u&s;e her own words, pre&s;ent her&s;elf at Holyroodhou&s;e before Albany, "&s;ore weeping," and intreating mercy for her coun&s;ellors Drummond and Dunkeld: her tears and &s;upplications met with cold neglect, and &s;he returned to the ca&s;tle of Edinburgh, in which &s;he now re&s;ided, as being a part of her enfeoffment, amid &s;olitude and con&s;ternation.

<P>The regent directed that the &s;hires and towns &s;hould be ruled by the u&s;ual magi&s;trates, as in the reign of James IV; yet the Engli&s;h influence was excited even to di&s;tract this &s;a|lutary de&s;ign, and Henry exulted in di&s;turbing where he could not command<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Dacre to the Council, B.

The council of England had de&s;ired Dacre to procure, by the influence of Home or &s;ome other great lord, an emba&s;&s;y to be &s;ent to England concerning a la&s;ting peace; and at the &s;ame time to u&s;e every art in order to prolong the di&s;&s;entions be|tween Albany and Angus, and by inventions to rai&s;e jealou&s;y

Dacre not only &s;ucceeded in the&s;e mea|&s;ures, but began to win other Scoti&s;h nobles di&s;gu&s;ted with the regent's haughtine&s;s, or neglect; and the baton of Albany, entwi&s;ted with thorns, was &s;oon to torture his ra&s;h and un|&s;killful hand. In vain did he feign amity to England, in vain did he &s;toop, on the return of the Unicorn herald, even to proclaim the peace him&s;elf, to continue as long as France and England &s;hould maintain their treaty; while the people &s;miled to &s;ee their governor appear in this new character, at the cro&s;s of Edinburgh, and by the voice of trumpets announce his own neglect of his dignity<NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Though certain lords had long before been appointed by the council of &s;tate, as already mentioned, to who&s;e cu&s;tody the king was committed, yet the royal children remained in the queen's care, to whom the lords guardians were &s;ubordinate, as no mandate had been i&s;&s;ued by parliament to withdraw them from their mother, who&s;e tender attentions formed the be&s;t &s;ecurity of their infant health and welfare; nor had the power of the queen and Angus been &s;o enfeebled as to render &s;uch a mandate, if it had been given, of ea&s;y execution. It was not only a mo&s;t important object in it&s;elf for Albany to get po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of the king and his brother, as the &s;ure&s;t pledges of power, but the clande&s;tine negotiation for conveying them to England, which certainly did not wholly e&s;cape the regent's ear, authorized the attempt; and had they even been &s;ent to France, as it happened to the infant Mary in her &s;ub&s;equent reign, the long concord between that country and Scotland rendered &s;uch an event not illaudable; whereas between
<PB N="140" REF="146">England and Scotland there had been continued enmity; and a treaty, a ran&s;om, degrading conditions, mu&s;t at lea&s;t have been nece&s;&s;ary for their re&s;toration. Accordingly the regent induced the national council, &s;till a&s;&s;embled at Edinburgh, to name eight lords<NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">This natrative is wholly derived from the long and intere&s;ting letter of Dacre, la&s;t quoted.</NOTE> <NOTE PLACE="marg">about 22 July</NOTE> from whom Albany, or lots, &s;elected four; and from the&s;e four the queen was to chu&s;e three, having, in other words, the power of rejecting any one whom &s;he mo&s;t di&s;liked. The&s;e three peers were to have the cu&s;tody of the king and his brother, wholly independent of the queen; and under no appointment nor controul, except of the parliament, or rather of Albany. The four peers proceeded from the parliament hou&s;e to the ca&s;tle of Edinburgh in due &s;olemnity, amid a concour&s;e of people a&s;&s;embled to behold this new and grand &s;cene; a queen, a mother, &s;urrendering her children to the repre&s;entatives of the nation. On their approach the gates were thrown open; and the people beheld with &s;ympathy and admiration the young and beautiful queen, &s;tanding at the entrance with the infant king by her &s;ide, his hand locked in hers; behind was the nur&s;e with the other royal babe in her arms; around appeared Angus, and a few attendants. The &s;houts of acclamation having cea&s;ed, and the parliamentary delegates being near, Margaret, with infinite grace and maje&s;ty, exclaimed to them aloud, "Stand. Declare the cau&s;e of your coming." The peers, an&s;wering that they were &s;ent by the parliament to demand their king and his brother, were &s;truck with awe and confu&s;ion when the queen's command re&s;ounded, "Drop the portcullis!" This ma&s;&s;y grate of iron being in|&s;tantly let down, between Margaret and the a&s;toni&s;hed dele|gates, &s;he thus addre&s;&s;ed them: "This ca&s;tle is part of my enfeoffment, and of it by my late hu&s;band the king was I made
<PB N="141" REF="147">&s;ole governe&s;s; nor to any mortal &s;hall I yield the important command. But I re&s;pect the parliament, and nation; and reque&s;t &s;ix days to con&s;ider their mandate; for of infinite con|&s;equence is my charge; and my coun&s;ellors now, alas! are few." She then withdrew; and the peers retired, penetrated with amazement, when they beheld &s;uch youth and beauty attended with &s;uch &s;pirit and prudence.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as this grand &s;cene had pa&s;&s;ed, Angus, apprehen&s;ive le&s;t, by di&s;obeying an order of the regent in parliament, he might have forfeited his life and his lands, took notarial in|&s;truments, that he had de&s;ired that the children &s;hould be furrendered<NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>. On the fifth day thereafter the queen &s;ignified her reque&s;t, that the king and his brother might be left in her charge, on condition that &s;he maintained them on her dowry; or, if this might not be granted, &s;he de&s;ired that they might be committed to the cu&s;tody of Angus, Home, the Earl Mar|&s;hall, and Sir Robert Lawder of Ba&s;s<NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>. As &s;he ju&s;tly expected that neither of the&s;e demands would win compliance, &s;he had, in the mean time, withdrawn with her children from the ca&s;tle of Edinburgh, a city in which &s;he had no &s;trong influence, to that of Stirling her u&s;ual re&s;idence, and a town which in cour&s;e much favoured her cau&s;e. Albany &s;ecure of the &s;upport of the parliament, now by favours and French gold wholly at his devotion by a decided majority, while, as u&s;ual in Scoti&s;h par|liaments, the minority did not attend, re&s;olved at all events to accompli&s;h this important de&s;ign. He mu&s;tered all the men of Edinburgh, capable of arms, and de&s;ired them to be ready to follow him on the &s;horte&s;t notice: meantime he &s;ent the lords Borthwick and Ruthven, with their followers, to remain in the town of Stirling, and prevent any victuals from pa&s;&s;ing
<PB N="142" REF="148">into the ca&s;tle<NOTE N="7" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>. The di&s;&s;olution of the parliament only in|crea&s;ed his arbitrary proceedings again&s;t the queen's friends. Angus was now in the county whence his title was derived; and Archibald Douglas his uncle, who had wedded an opulent widow of Edinburgh, was at Douglas ca&s;tle; but Sir George Douglas, brother of Angus, remaining at Edinburgh, Albany maliciou&s;ly ordered Home, now provo&s;t of that city, to arre&s;t him; which that peer refu&s;ed, as not being decreed by parlia|ment, and &s;aid that the office belonged rather to a herald than to him. Sir George however fled to the Mer&s;e: and Home, the &s;ame night, retired, attended only by one &s;ervant, to a hou&s;e of his near the borders called Newark. The indecent &s;pleen of the regent prompted him even to command Angus, on his allegiance, to march his bands to Stirling, to blockade his own wife; an order, as being impo&s;&s;ible to obey, worthy of the mo&s;t wanton de&s;poti&s;m, not to add the extreme of cruelty, the queen being now far advanced in her pregnancy by this her &s;econd hu&s;band. At the &s;ame time a proclamation was fulminated, declaring all tho&s;e who continued to retain the ca&s;tle of Stir|ling again&s;t the regent and parliament, to be liable to the for|feiture of life and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions. All the&s;e preparations were worthy of laughter, when it is con&s;idered that they were le|velled again&s;t a &s;olitary fortre&s;s, unfurni&s;hed with ammunition and provi&s;ions; and again&s;t a defencele&s;s woman, only armed with her &s;pirit, and her tears: but they excited the malignity of the Engli&s;h faction, who pretended to gather uncommon con&s;equences from the&s;e uncommon means. Dacre even ad|vi&s;es the Engli&s;h council of &s;tate to interfere, for if James and his brother fell into Albany's hands they would certainly be murdered; and he remarks a dubiou&s;ne&s;s in the late comprehen|&s;ion

<P>At length every preparation being made, the regent, attended by mo&s;t of the Scoti&s;h peers, in order that they might warrant the mea&s;ure by their pre&s;ence, and leading not le&s;s than &s;even thou&s;and men, marched to Stirling<NOTE N="9" PLACE="foot">O.

Margaret &s;miled in di&s;dain, when &s;he beheld the army and artillery of Albany; and gave to her &s;on, the king, the keys of the fortre&s;s, which the infant, at her nod, put into the hands of the regent. She then conde&s;cended to reque&s;t Albany's favour to the king, and his brother, to her&s;elf, and to Angus; for her&s;elf and her &s;ons the an&s;wer was beneficent; but the duke declared that, regarding Angus and his family as traitors, he could &s;hew them no indulgence. The queen was then forced to return to the ca&s;tle of Edinburgh, where &s;he remained for a month, not without &s;ome appearance of captivity, being &s;trictly watched by &s;pies placed around her. The regent garri&s;oned the ca&s;tle of Stirling with &s;even hundred men; and gave the king and his brother, with the fortre&s;s, in charge to the Earl Mar&s;hall, and the lords Fleming and Borth|wick. About the &s;ame time Albany's &s;ervants pillaged Home's re&s;idence at Edinburgh; and the celebrated Patrick Panter the &s;ecretary was, on account of his attachment to that nobleman, arre&s;ted, and his goods de&s;poiled; he was then committed pri|&s;oner to Inch Garvey, a &s;mall i&s;le oppo&s;ite to Queen's ferry, where he was confined in a tower built by James IV, towards

<P>Meanwhile Angus had retired into Tividale, to concert with Home what mea&s;ures they &s;hould pur&s;ue. The regent re&s;olved at once to terminate their &s;chemes, and &s;ummoned a large array to meet him at Burrowmuir near Edinburgh before the end of Augu&s;t. Home, on his &s;ide, victualled Fa&s;tca&s;tle; and Dacre availed him&s;elf of his neighbourhood, to in&s;tigate him more and more again&s;t Albany, but Angus he regarded as too young to be entru&s;ted with a political conference<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>. Albany having returned to Edinburgh,<NOTE PLACE="marg">14 Aug.</NOTE> made an attempt to gain the queen and Angus, by offering them articles, importing that they &s;hould unite with his mea&s;ures in the government, and de&s;ire no aid from other realms e&s;pecially from England, with|out the &s;pecial leave of the regent, and the three e&s;tates; while he, on his &s;ide, engaged to help and defend them in all their ju&s;t and equitable actions, cau&s;es, and quarrels, and par|ticularly to put the queen in full po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of her enfeoffment, or jointure-lands, of which, in the di&s;orders of the times, &s;he had been in a great degree bereaved; a lo&s;s which reduced her to a poverty to be e&s;teemed great, when her &s;tation, and former means, were con&s;idered.

<P>The neglect of the French monarchs, Louis XII and Francis I, who, in contradiction of the terms of the alliance with Scot|land, had concluded their pacifications with Henry, without the previous con&s;ent of the Scoti&s;h government, had irritated the Scots; who accepted the comprehen&s;ion in the treaties with &s;uch neglect, and in &s;o equivocal a manner, that it re|mained doubtful whether England and Scotland were in a &s;tate of peace or war. At the &s;ame time the recent alliance between France and Scotland being under&s;tood to expire upon the death of the contracting monarchs, if not ratified anew, Du Planis had arrived to accompli&s;h this object, not without jealou&s;y on the part of England, again&s;t which that alliance had been directed. It was therefore an eager wi&s;h of Henry that an emba&s;&s;y &s;hould be &s;ent from Scotland, formally to conclude a peace, or at lea&s;t a truce; and Albany, to prevent the ob&s;truction of his de&s;igns, now amu&s;ed Dacre with the hope of that emba&s;&s;y. But the Engli&s;h warden, knowing the regent's art, continued neverthele&s;s to hold many conferences with Home, and to promi&s;e him Henry's effectual &s;upport<NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot">O.

<P>A mo&s;t unexpected &s;cene now took place: Home not only contriving a &s;peedy e&s;cape, but per&s;uading his keeper to ac|company him.

Certain it is that Home, after giving notice to his two brothers, whom he had &s;ent for as ho&s;tages, to flee to England, as he and Arran intended to e&s;cape from the ca&s;tle of Edinburgh that night, effectuated his purpo&s;e with &s;ecrecy and &s;ecurity.

<P>This delay was not granted; and the chief articles of treaty on both &s;ides being rejected, for the Engli&s;h the &s;ecurity of James from Albany's power, for the Scots the inclu&s;ion of France, the regent advanced his army to the Engli&s;h frontiers; and on the ninth of September it encamped at Annan<NOTE N="7" PLACE="foot">O.

Yet the cardinal was fortunately oppo&s;ed to Albany; who on this

But all their efforts could not prevent the pillage of Tividale, and the conflagration of the fair town of Jedburgh, containing at that time twice as many hou&s;es as Berwick, many of them of beautiful architecture; it was de|fended by &s;ix &s;trong towers, and was capable of receiving a garri&s;on of one thou&s;and cavalry. Sir William Bulmer and Sir Thomas Tempe&s;t conducted the &s;trong detachment, which captured the town,<NOTE PLACE="marg">24 Sept.</NOTE> and gave it completely to the flames, &s;o that a reedification was nece&s;&s;ary before it could be inhabited. But this achievement was followed by an unexpected and &s;trange di&s;a&s;ter, on the &s;ide of the Engli&s;h. Their camp was &s;urrounded with the provi&s;ion waggons, and a ditch: but while Surrey was engaged in the a&s;&s;ault of the abbey, which la&s;ted till two hours after night fell, Dacre had, for &s;ome unknown cau&s;e, &s;tationed his cavalry without the precinct of the camp. Next day Surrey &s;ent Dacre to attack the ca&s;tle of Ferniher&s;t,<NOTE PLACE="marg">25 Sep.</NOTE> along with Sir Arthur Darcy and Sir Marmaduke Con&s;table; but that hold being &s;urrounded with a wood was well defended, and before it yielded, many on both &s;ides were &s;lain and wounded. On his return Dacre re&s;umed his former &s;tation on the out&s;ide of the camp; and about eight o'clock, while he &s;at at &s;upper with Surrey, the hor&s;es of his cavalry broke loo&s;e; and, running around the camp, &s;pread an univer&s;al alarm, as it was &s;uppo&s;ed the Scots were a&s;&s;aulting the entrenchments;
<PB N="221" REF="227">and many guns, and not le&s;s than an hundred &s;heaves of ar|rows were di&s;charged at them. Of fifteen hundred hor&s;es, thus running wild, not &s;even hundred were &s;aved: about five hundred were &s;hot, or wandered in divers directions; two hundred and fifty ran into Jedburgh, &s;till in flames, where they were &s;eized and carried off by Scoti&s;h women; fifty plunged to death down a precipice. It is ri&s;ible to find Surrey an hone&s;t and credulous &s;oldier, &s;eriou&s;ly imputing this di&s;a&s;ter to daemons.

<PB N="273" REF="279">of July 1525<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">See it in Keith's Hi&s;t.

But Angus was al&s;o warden of the marches, an office attended with great authority: while on the other hand in the ab&s;ence of the queen, who could not venture to approach the capital, a chief &s;eat of the influence of Angus, the chancellor appears to have been perpetual pre&s;ident of the council of &s;tate; and Magnus ever mentions, and addre&s;&s;es, him as po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the highe&s;t power. During the affair of Linlithgow the earl of Arran ought to have been with the king in the capital; but as Angus had ha&s;tened to conclude the peace with England before his quarter expired, &s;o he feared that Arran would defeat that mea&s;ure during his period of power, and &s;eems to have u&s;ed &s;uch endeavours again&s;t that peer's a&s;&s;ertion of his right, that he was forced to an ineffectual recour&s;e to arms.

The council of &s;tate continued to exerci&s;e its full power, even again&s;t Angus him|&s;elf. Magnus addre&s;&s;ed the chancellor, and the council<NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">C. Cal. B.

<P>Angus, who appears to have retained his high honour of hu&s;band to the queen, &s;olely with a view to enjoy her revenues, finding that this u&s;urpation was not to be continued, without forfeiting Henry's favour; a clau&s;e of the late peace, and the deci&s;ion of the council al&s;o oppo&s;ing his avaricious views, at length con&s;ented to the divorce, which was pronounced by the chancellor at St. Andrew's, upon the vain ground of a previous

<P>At this epoch Angus was on the borders, whither he had marched to repre&s;s the di&s;orders of the Arm&s;trongs, then the mo&s;t powerful and ferocious of the clans on the frontiers; but being protected by the Kers of Tividale, and by lord Maxwell, the warden of the we&s;tern marches, the freebooters defied his power<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Ibid. The Scoti&s;h council had i&s;&s;ued a proclamation of &s;trict neutrality, towards the &s;hips of France, and tho&s;e of Spain and Flanders, &s;ubject to the emperor, then at war with their ancient ally: ib.</NOTE>.<NOTE PLACE="marg">April</NOTE> Magnus, the Engli&s;h emba&s;&s;ador, now left Scotland, after a re&s;idence of a year and a half; during which he had conducted the affairs entru&s;ted to his care with eminent mode|ration and ability.</P>
<P>The con&s;ideration of the &s;teps which led Angus to the &s;u|preme power mu&s;t now be re&s;umed. He had &s;edulou&s;ly cul|tivated the favour of the young king, by pre&s;ents, and by every attention and indulgence, which could &s;ecure his unexperienced affections; and the nece&s;&s;ary re&s;idence of the monarch in the
<PB N="276" REF="282">capital, where, as in all the &s;outh of Scotland, the influence of Angus was unrivalled, further promoted his de&s;ign. James regarded the marriage of his mother as an in&s;ult; and the variance was increa&s;ed by her rage at the impri&s;onment of her hu&s;band. Amid the&s;e di&s;po&s;itions, Angus was &s;ecure of his a&s;cendant over the king's mind; and the &s;ecret council formed the only ob&s;tacle to his ambition. By &s;ome precedents in France and Scotland the majority of a monarch was determined to commence at his fourteenth year, which James had attained in the preceding April; the object therefore was to &s;ummon a parliament, in which the majority of James &s;hould be declared, and the powers of the &s;ecret council in con&s;equence annulled. Nor could either the parliament, or council, oppo&s;e with de|cency a decree &s;trictly con&s;titutional, and agreeable to the wi&s;h of the nation, di&s;gu&s;ted with the con&s;tant &s;truggles, and with the di&s;cordant mea&s;ures, of &s;ucce&s;&s;ive juntos.</P>
<P>Angus having prepared his plan, a parliament met at Edin|burgh,<NOTE PLACE="marg">17 June</NOTE> on the thirteenth of June<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Carm.

In the letters of July 1528, (&s;ee that epoch,) and the act again&s;t Angus, July 1528, Crawf. 70, it is mentioned that he had retained his power for TWO YEARS; &s;o that the commencement of his authority is a&s;certained beyond doubt.</NOTE>, bearing that as the king had now attained his complete majority of fourteen years, the whole regal prerogatives re&s;ted in his own hands: and all other authority, formerly u&s;ed in his name, is declared to be ter|minated. This decree, for the cau&s;es above recited, in fact threw the &s;upreme power into the hands of Angus.</P>
<P>The precipitate marriage of Margaret ruined her influence; and Arran had abandoned her de&s;perate cau&s;e to join the chan|cellor, his relation, and Angus. This acce&s;&s;ion afforded a
<PB N="277" REF="283">great additional weight of power, and Angus carefully endea|voured to pre&s;erve the attachment of Arran. The chancellor was now le&s;s nece&s;&s;ary to the &s;upport of Angus, who began to manife&s;t his a&s;cendancy by heaping royal favours upon his own family, and by neglecting the chancellor, and &s;ome other members of the late council, who had expected to &s;hare the &s;poils. The impetuous nature of Sir George Douglas, brother to Angus, and by who&s;e councils he was wholly guided, changed his influence over the king into a kind of con&s;traint; and James &s;ighed when he beheld his former flatterers transformed into his goalers<NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">This previous information, nece&s;&s;ary to the clearne&s;s of the narrative, will be authenticated by &s;ub&s;equent letters.</NOTE>. The ancient power of the Dougla&s;es &s;eemed to have revived, and after a &s;lumber of near a century, again to threaten de&s;truction to the Scoti&s;h monarchy.</P>
<P>On his fir&s;t a&s;&s;umption of the authority, Angus had ex|cited di&s;content by a&s;&s;igning the opulent abbacy of Holyrood-hou&s;e to William, his brother, who already po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by intru|&s;ion that of Coldingham<NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot">Buch.

The faction, and even the name of the leader, were further &s;tained by the ba&s;e a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination of Patrick Blackader, archdeacon of Dumblane, cou&s;in of the prior of Coldingham, who&s;e murder by Home of Wedderburn is above narrated.

<P>Meanwhile the di&s;orders of the Arm&s;trongs, and other marauders on the frontiers, continuing, Angus re&s;olved to conduct the king in per&s;on to repre&s;s them. James, having advanced to Jedburgh, remained there three days without much effect: and, on the fourth day,<NOTE PLACE="marg">25 July</NOTE> was returning by Mel|ro&s;e, when on a &s;udden, Walter Scot of Buccleugh appeared,
<PB N="278" REF="284">with a thou&s;and armed followers. This powerful border chief|tain was a retainer of Lennox, a circum&s;tance which unites with &s;ucceeding events, to vindicate the opinion entertained by our hi&s;torians, that Buccleugh intended to re&s;cue the king from the inferior force of Angus. A me&s;&s;enger pa&s;&s;ed to Scot to enquire the rea&s;on of his appearance with &s;uch a company. The an&s;wer was, that he only de&s;igned to &s;hew his bands to the king, as not unu&s;ual among the border chief|tains, when that part of his dominions was graced with the royal pre&s;ence. He was then commanded, in the name of the monarch, to di&s;mi&s;s his followers: but he replied that he was better informed of the king's intentions. Angus, per|ceiving a conflict unavoidable, ordered his followers, (many of whom were gentlemen, who, by their armour and courage, &s;upplied the inferiority of number,) to alight, as u&s;ual with the Scots, who rarely fought on hor&s;eback, excepting the trained cavalry, who&s;e weapons were peculiar, and who&s;e &s;teeds were enured to the noi&s;e and tumult of battle. Lennox, Maxwell, and Sir George Douglas formed a guard around James, who retired to an eminence. Angus, Fleming, Home, Ker of Ce&s;sford, led on their bands again&s;t tho&s;e of Buccleugh, now al&s;o alighted from their &s;teeds. The conflict was brief: Buccleugh's borderers, after throwing their &s;pears, fled in confu&s;ion, and about eighty of them were flain: their chief, after a &s;trenuous conte&s;t, were forced to retire, but not without the flaughter of many of his enemies.

<P>An us triumphed in his victory: and Lennox, being &s;u&s;|pected, r$tired from the court. The chancellor meanwhile found his power dimini&s;hed by Angus, who had even con&s;trained

For, on pa&s;&s;ing Cor&s;tor|phin, the &s;ound of the artillery was heard announcing the commencement of the conflict; and &s;ir George having in vain intreated the king to u&s;e &s;peed, he at length bur&s;t into this ra&s;h expre&s;&s;ion, "Should our enemies vanqui&s;h, rather than &s;urrender your per&s;on, we &s;hould tear you in halves.<NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">Buch.

A groom of the late earl of Lennox, of heroic attachment to his ma&s;ter, who had fallen by the cruel hand of &s;ir James Hamilton after he had yielded, came to Edinburgh; where, meeting a fellow &s;ervant, he enquired if he had &s;een the ba&s;tard of Arran? being an&s;wered in the affirmative, he replied, "Ungrateful wretch! could&s;t thou behold the murderer of our ma&s;ter without &s;tabbing him to the heart? Begone; di&s;grace me not by thy ba&s;e company." He then proceeded to the palace of Holyroodhou&s;e, in the open area before which not le&s;s than two thou&s;and attendants of the hou&s;es of Douglas and Hamilton were, at that hour, mu&s;tered for the expedition. Piercing through the crowd, he

<P>Some events worthy of commemoration happened in the northern provinces. The hou&s;es of Le&s;ley and Forbes being at enmity, the counties of Mar, Gareoch, and Aberdeen, were expo&s;ed to con&s;tant ravages and reprizals; but by the interference of Angus the differences were compo&s;ed, and a la&s;ting friend&s;hip e&s;tabli&s;hed. While the lowlands frequently afforded &s;cenes of rapine and &s;laughter, the highlands were lo&s;t in all the outrage which di&s;tingui&s;hes a &s;avage &s;tate of &s;o|ciety. Lachlan Mackinto&s;h, chief of the noted clan Chattan, being a man of prudence, and attached to good order, re&s;tricted his people from the exce&s;&s;es u&s;ual to the other clans. James Malcom&s;on his relation, de&s;irous to terminate this re&s;traint; ba&s;ely a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated the worthy leader, and took refuge in an i&s;le of the lake of Rothemurky: but he, and his a&s;&s;ociates, were pur&s;ued by the clan, and put to an ignominious death. The &s;on of the late chief being very young, he was delivered to the care of the earl of Murray for his education: and Hector Mackinto&s;h, the ba&s;tard brother of Lachlan, was appointed leader of the clan till his nephew &s;hould be of age. The new chieftain in vain endeavoured to recover from Murray his young charge, either to lend more firmne&s;s to his power, or by his death to en&s;ure its duration. Irritated by the earl's oppo&s;ition he ravaged his lands, captured the town of Dyke, and ca&s;tle of Tarnaway; conflagration, &s;laughter, rapine, marking his ferocious progre&s;s. The ca&s;tle of Pettie, belong|ing to Ogilvy of Durne&s;s, was al&s;o taken; and twenty four of that name &s;lain, becau&s;e Murray had committed the young chief to the care of the Ogilvies, his relations on the mother's &s;ide. Emboldened by &s;ucce&s;s Hector proceeded to other out|rages,

In the knowledge of the laws and cu&s;toms of his kingdom he was &s;o completely ver&s;ed, that his deci&s;ions were as exact as they were expeditions; and from hor&s;eback he often pro|nounced decrees worthy of the &s;age&s;t &s;eat of ju&s;tice.

The dangers of the wilderne&s;s, the gloom of night, the tempe&s;ts of winter, could not prevent his patient exertions to protect the helple&s;s, to puni&s;h the guilty, to enforce the ob|&s;ervance of the laws.

<P>The faults of his government, though not minute, are more to be a&s;cribed to the times, than to the character of the mo|narch. His avarice naturally aro&s;e from the penury of his education, the di&s;&s;ipation of his finances, and even of the fur|niture of his palaces, by the unprincipled duke of Albany. But his ama&s;&s;ed trea&s;ure was employed in the con&s;truction of magnificent works of architecture, and of a navy; and in other plans of general utility and glory. His political de&s;igns were long &s;tudied; yet as he died in his thirtieth year he could not have acquired the experience of age: and the period of his reign pre&s;ented combinations too intricate for the mo&s;t &s;kilful
<PB N="294" REF="300">prudence to fore&s;ee, or define. The progre&s;s of the prote&s;tant religion was dubious; and dangerous it is for a prince to em|brace a new &s;y&s;tem before it be approved by a great majority of his &s;ubjects. Untaught by the glorious concord between his father and the nobles, James entertained a fixed enmity again&s;t the ari&s;tocracy, which had effected great u&s;urpations during his minority; and his attachment to the eminent clergy, who alone could balance their power, was unavoidable.</P>
<P>Of the per&s;on, and dome&s;tic life, of James V the features are well known. His frame was of the middle &s;ize, and ro|bu&s;t, capable of every exertion of agility, or fatigue. In ele|gance of form, and countenance, he equalled any prince of his time. His oval face, blue eyes of piercing &s;plendor, aqui|line no&s;e, yellow hair, and &s;mall beard forked in the fa&s;hion of that period, impre&s;&s;ed the beholders with ideas of &s;weet|ne&s;s joined with maje&s;ty. In dre&s;s he was rather elegant than magnificent: yet his palaces were replete with decoration. The repa&s;t of a pea&s;ant he would &s;hare; and, even from a &s;umptuous board, the royal meal was plain, and frugal; nor did he entru&s;t his dignity to the intemperance of wine. Emi|nently patient he was of labour, of hunger and thir&s;t, of heat and cold. His attachment to the arts was decided: he reared palaces of good architecture; and compo&s;ed &s;ome fugitive pieces of poetry, though it be doubtful if any have reached our times<NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">Sir D. Lind&s;ay, a contemporary, avouches the royal poetry, in his "An&s;wer to the king's flyting." Drummond, 228, &s;ays <HI>many</HI> of his ver&s;es were extant in his time.

He repleni&s;hed his country with artillery, and military weapons; and the beauty of his gold coins be&s;peaks his attention even to the minute&s;t improvements, to be gained by the employment of foreign arti&s;ts. The Scoti&s;h navy,

<P>Two important events di&s;tingui&s;h this year,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1532 17 May</NOTE> the in&s;titution of the college of ju&s;tice, and a war or rather an interruption of the peace with England. A parliament a&s;&s;embled, in which the various articles of the in&s;titution of a new court of law were con&s;idered and pa&s;&s;ed<NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot">Acts, f. 113. MS. Harl. 2363, f. 18, written by a contemporary, John Smyth monk of Kinlo&s;s. The inaccurate edition of our &s;tatutes by Murray of Glendook places this in&s;titution in 1537: yet the king's ratification, p. 121, bears, in the nineteenth year of his reign, that is 1532!</NOTE>. The plan, which was in imitation of the parliament of Paris, had been formerly pro|jected by the regent Albany. Before this in&s;titution civil cau&s;es were adjudged by &s;tanding committees, con&s;i&s;ting of members of each of the three parliamentary orders, who made an annual circuit into each of the quarters of the kingdom. The plan was attended with many inconveniencies; the ex|pence to which the members were expo&s;ed rendered them re|luctant in performing this duty, and precipitant in its accom|pli&s;hment. And the deputies of the commons being annually changed, if a &s;uit were prolonged, the change of judges, who
<PB N="314" REF="320">were again to be in&s;tructed in the whole procedure, rendered the embarra&s;&s;ment and protraction extreme; not to mention that perhaps none of the members, except the clergy, were conver&s;ant in the laws. The new in&s;titution has been attacked with rancour by Buchanan, who&s;e prote&s;tant enmity to James, (becau&s;e that monarch did not ra&s;hly exchange his faith for a new doctrine, not yet adopted by the majority of his people,) delights to mi&s;repre&s;ent the motives, and actions, of a prince, whom, in the conclu&s;ion of his reign, he is con&s;trained highly to applaud. That famous hi&s;torian &s;ays, "there being hardly any laws in Scotland, except the acts of parliament, which are mo&s;tly of the temporary cla&s;s; and tho&s;e judges preventing, as far as their power will permit, the enaction of new &s;tatutes; the properties of all the citizens are in fact committed to the arbitrement of fifteen men, who&s;e power is perpetual, and who&s;e controul is tyrannical, &s;ince their wills form their only laws<NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot">Buch. XIV, 43.</NOTE>." This &s;atire might have &s;ome ju&s;tice when Buchanan wrote; but the numerous acts of parliament, the codes of de|ci&s;ions, the power of appeal &s;ince the union of the kingdoms, the very attention of the judges to their own character, while &s;eated in the tribunal before a &s;agacious public in an en|lightened age, all con&s;pire to overturn its pre&s;ent force. That the Engli&s;h mode of deciding even civil cau&s;es by jury is far more favourable to freedom, than this plan of a &s;tanding jury, appointed and paid by the king, is mo&s;t evident; and truth will reluctantly confe&s;s that few and rare are tho&s;e judges, or even lawyers, in Scotland, who have twined the wreath of eloquence around the altar of freedom. Yet, on the other hand, the in&s;titution of the court of &s;e&s;&s;ion could flow from no arbitrary principle, as it was confe&s;&s;edly founded in imitation
<PB N="315" REF="321">of the parliament of Paris; and it is well known that the latter court alone nouri&s;hed the feeble flame of liberty, while the night of de&s;poti&s;m had enveloped France.</P>
<P>It is unnece&s;&s;ary to enter into the trivial detail of the various articles relating to this important in&s;titution.

<P>The brief interruption of the peace with England, by mu|tual inroads, demands the explanation of a cur&s;ory glance on the affairs of Europe. An alliance between Francis and Henry again&s;t the emperor had &s;ub&s;i&s;ted for &s;ix years; half of the &s;pace in war; the latter half in a peace, which was to continue for two years longer, though Francis now joined the league of Smalcald. Henry, eager in pro&s;ecuting his divorce from Catherine of Arragon, was about to liberate his kingdom
<PB N="316" REF="322">from the ignominious chains of Rome. The treaty between him and Francis was renewed, and a conference appointed, which took place in October this year: and was followed, in December, by a fruitle&s;s interview between the emperor and the pope<NOTE N="9" PLACE="foot">Herbert's Henry VIII, &s;ub anno.</NOTE>. The impul&s;e which Henry had given to the popular opinion, by his deci&s;ive conduct again&s;t Rome, agi|tated all Europe. The north of Germany, the kingdoms of Denmark and Sweden, had already embraced the prote&s;tant religion: England had abjured the Roman influence; France and Scotland abounded with the di&s;ciples of Luther: and the cri&s;is had &s;uddenly become &s;o new, and important, that the mo&s;t &s;killfull politicians could not decide on its infinite combi|nations and con&s;equences.</P>
<P>James, who li&s;tened with plea&s;ure and in&s;truction to the conver&s;ations of Lind&s;ay, and other learned prote&s;tants in his kingdom, was far from being decided in his re&s;olutions con|cerning the new &s;y&s;tem. A variance al&s;o appears to have pre|vailed between him and his clergy, on account of the expence of the new court of ju&s;tice; and they had appealed to the pope. Amid &s;uch di&s;po&s;itions it was remote from the intere&s;ts of James or Henry to proceed to ho&s;tilities; and the attempt to excite a war appears to have ari&s;en from di&s;affected &s;ubjects of one or both kingdoms; but mo&s;t probably from the ob&s;tinate catholics of the north of England, where ignorance as u&s;ual nur&s;ed &s;uper&s;tition. Certain it is that the Scoti&s;h hi&s;torians a&s;cribe the di&s;cord to the Engli&s;h, while the chronicles of the latter nation confute not the charge. Le&s;ley blames William lord Dacre, the warden of the we&s;tern marches, who&s;e friend|&s;hip to Angus induced him to interrupt the peace:<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Le&s;l. 435.</NOTE>: Bu|chanan he&s;itates not to doubt Henry's own intentions, who,

<P>One of the chief objects of the conference between the pope and the emperor, mentioned under the preceding year, was to oppo&s;e or puni&s;h the defection of Henry VIII from the Roman faith.

His progre&s;s de&s;erves &s;ome attention, as illu&s;trative of the manners of the times. Hunting was his favourite amu&s;ement; and great was the &s;laughter of deer, roes, foxes, and of wolves, an animal then, and long after, not unfrequent in the Scoti&s;h fore&s;ts. In Athole he was entertained, with &s;ingular magni|ficence, by the earl of that de&s;ignation. In the mid&s;t of a fair meadow a palace was con&s;tructed of green wood, entwined with the verdant boughs of birch: it was of a quadrangular form, and each corner was &s;trengthened by a ma&s;&s;y and lofty tower. The tur$etted gate was not wanting; nor the &s;ecurity of the ditch, drawbridge, and portcullis. The floors were &s;trewn with odoriferous herbs and blo&s;&s;oms; the walls were enlightened by numerous windows of fine gla&s;s, and adorned with &s;ilken tape&s;try. Nor did the enchantment of the genii of the fore&s;t fail to &s;upply all that could appea&s;e or pamper the appetite of the royal hunter, and his woodland train. Meat and game of every de&s;cription abounded; and the ditches were filled with the mo&s;t delicate fi&s;h. Wines, white, claret,
<PB N="323" REF="329">mu&s;cadel, and malm&s;ey, hyppocras, brandy, and the whole|&s;ome beverages from malt, gratified thir&s;t, or excited hilarity. The de&s;&s;ert was crowned with the choice&s;t fruits and confec|tions: and the ve&s;&s;els and linnen were worthy of a palace: nor were the luxuries of nocturnal repo&s;e, half of the life of man, unknown to the fairy man&s;ion. The officers of the hou&s;hold, and of the kitchen, were numerous, and &s;elected with care. Here Athole treated his royal gue&s;t for three days, and nights; and the expence of the entertainment, enormous for the time, was computed at three thou&s;and pounds. The wonder of the papal emba&s;&s;ador was yet further increa&s;ed, when, upon the departure of James, the whole edifice, pre|&s;ented one conflagration; and the monarch only ob&s;erved, with a &s;mile, "It is the cu&s;tom of our highlanders to burn their lodgings<NOTE N="8" PLACE="foot">Lind&s;ay, 226&mdash;228.</NOTE>."</P>

While the &s;ucce&s;s of the prote&s;tant religion in Scotland was to in&s;tigate the writers of that per&s;ua&s;ion to brand James as a tyrant, it is impo&s;&s;ible for a politician, or philo&s;o|pher, to cen&s;ure his conduct, as he was only hurried along in the nece&s;&s;ary &s;tream of public affairs. The executions on account of religion during his reign are few, nor do they equal tho&s;e of one year of Henry: the attachment of James to his clergy was far from being &s;ervile, as his demand of contributions from them, and his impri&s;onment of the archbi&s;hop of St. Andrew's, may declare: and there is rea&s;on to impute the per&s;ecutions of the reformed not to any &s;anguinary or &s;uper|&s;titious

<P>The Engli&s;h king,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1535</NOTE> having now completely broken the papal domination in his realm, and being about to &s;uppre&s;s the mo|na&s;teries, and appropriate to him&s;elf a part of the unwieldy and indecent wealth of the church, e&s;teemed it more and more expedient to &s;ecure the amity of James, as that monarch might be induced to avail him&s;elf of the di&s;affection of the Engli&s;h catholics, and by their help a&s;pire to the crown, or at lea&s;t embarra&s;s the procedures of Henry. So firmly had the con|nection between Je&s;us Chri&s;t and his vicar, the pope, been rooted in the mind of ignorance, that the Scots, in common with the other catholics, regarded Henry's conduct as an abju|ration of chri&s;tianity, or indeed of all religion; blind zeal being ever prompt to brand any &s;light deviation from its own tenets with the name of athei&s;m. To efface &s;uch impre&s;&s;ions, Henry di&s;patched as his envoy to Scotland Dr. William Barlow, his chaplain, and bi&s;hop elect of St. A&s;aph, an eloquent preacher, and a warm enemy to the papal u&s;urpations<NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot">Herbert, 405, 413.

He was in&s;tructed to pre&s;ent to James a book now publi&s;hed by Henry, called "The doctrine of a chri&s;tian man," in which the &s;uper&s;titions of Rome were expo&s;ed; and to examine the inclinations of the Scots on this &s;ubject, and even, if James &s;hould grant permi&s;&s;ion, to di&s;play his eloquence in the pulpit. But Barlow informed &s;ecretary Cromwell<NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot">O. B. III, 194.

<PB N="328" REF="334">the council of James con&s;i&s;ted only of clergy devoted to Rome, "the pope's pe&s;tilent creatures, and very limbs of the devil," as he charitably expre&s;&s;es him&s;elf; that it was rumoured by an officer belonging to Albany that France intended to declare in favour of the pope again&s;t England, and Scotland would as u&s;ual imitate her old ally; that James was him&s;elf of an ex|cellent and generous di&s;po&s;ition, but his &s;piritual council de|cidedly inimical to Henry; that it was &s;arca&s;tically &s;aid that he had only come to preach; and he would exert his elocution again&s;t the papal abu&s;es if James would permit. But the clergy, the mo&s;t opulent order in Scotland, had too much influence to leave any hope of &s;uch permi&s;&s;ion; and they forbad James to contaminate his eyes with the heretical production of the Engli&s;h king.</P>
<P>Henry, who was a complete &s;tranger to the arts of conci|liation, with his u&s;ual imprudence now &s;ent lord William Howard,<NOTE PLACE="marg">April</NOTE> a &s;econd time, as his envoy into Scotland; a man of haughty character, and unexperienced in affairs of delibe|ration; and who&s;e pre&s;ence, as being of the family who &s;lew his father, could only give pain to James. The meeting be|tween the Engli&s;h and Scoti&s;h monarchs, propo&s;ed in the pre|ceding year, was to have taken place in France, and in the pre&s;ence of its king. But Henry's pa&s;&s;age to that realm being po&s;tponed, in the pre&s;ent new and critical &s;tate of his own dominions, a conference with James at York was the object of Howard's mi&s;&s;ion; which, as was to have been ex|pected in &s;uch hands,<NOTE PLACE="marg">25 Apr.</NOTE> proved un&s;ucce&s;sful. In a letter from Edinburgh<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">O. Cal. B.

<PB N="329" REF="335">that he might &s;hew it to his council; Howard re|plied that &s;uch a procedure was never heard of before; and he imputes this &s;ingularity to the advice of the clergy, who&s;e ma|lice would even bind the tongues of princes: the envoy was then introduced to the council, who declared that, if James had given them information before he had promi&s;ed a confe|rence, they would not have granted their con&s;ent; but &s;ince the royal promi&s;e was procured the interview mu&s;t take place at Newca&s;tle, and not at York, nor before michaelmas, as James would not be prepared before that time. Howard ob|jected the difficulty of Henry's accommodation between York and Newca&s;tle; the delay he a&s;cribes to a letter of Ottirburn, in&s;inuating that Henry was him&s;elf inclined to procra&s;tinate. The queen-mother was mo&s;t eager for the conference between the kings; and even expre&s;&s;ed her&s;elf with &s;uch warmth, that her &s;on was di&s;plea&s;ed at her interference.<NOTE N="8" PLACE="foot">Howard adds that the marriage with Vendome's daughter was fru&s;trated, that James intended to marry lord Er&s;kine's daughter, by whom he had a child; and that though &s;he was married [to Douglas of Lochleven] a divorce was ready. He &s;u&s;piciou&s;ly mentions Sir James Hamilton, as the &s;ole ma&s;ter of this &s;ecret. All this was mere &s;candal; and it is no wonder that James blamed Howard for &s;uch infamous reports.

The Hamil|tons oppo&s;ed the conference, as dreading the marriage of James: the clergy, from apprehen&s;ions of Henry's influence in promoting the defection of their monarch from Rome.

<P>A parliament was held at Edinburgh,<NOTE PLACE="marg">7 June</NOTE> being the fir&s;t of this reign of which a multitude of &s;tatutes is pre&s;erved<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Acts, f. 118&mdash;126.

As we approach more modern times, and the &s;tate of manners and government becomes more known from other &s;ources, it is unnece&s;&s;ary to narrate with equal minutene&s;s the various ordi|nances of the national council. Yet a rapid idea of the mo&s;t important may not be improper. The progre&s;s of the prote&s;tant doctrine having in&s;tigated many to contemn eccle&s;ia&s;tical cen|&s;ures, they were ordered to be enforced by the civil power. Several &s;alutary &s;tatutes of the fir&s;t and &s;econd James are con|firmed, and &s;trengthened; as tho&s;e concerning the planting of wood, the herring fi&s;hery, and others, which while they evince the good intentions of this legi&s;lature, impre&s;s at the &s;ame time a melancholy truth, that the cour&s;e of a century had effected little or no progre&s;s in the civilization of the realm: and that, to adopt the terms of the pre&s;ent ordinances, "it was unpro|fitable and u&s;ele&s;s to make laws, and &s;tatutes for policy to be had, except they be kept." To improve the breed of hor&s;es it was ordered, in imitation of an Engli&s;h &s;tatute, that &s;tallions of a large &s;ize &s;hould be nurtured.

The revocation of 1537 is, in the fir&s;t edition, given at 1535. Both are &s;ometimes inaccurate.</NOTE>. But the mo&s;t important ordinance concerns the bur|roughs. As many peers and landed gentlemen had procured them&s;elves to be elected into the magi&s;tracy, and under colour of protecting the towns, had dilapidated their re&s;ources, it was ordained that the magi&s;trates &s;hould thenceforth be cho&s;en &s;olely from among the &s;ub&s;tantial burge&s;&s;es, and merchants; and that they &s;hould annually produce their accompts at the exchequer, after a public notice of fifteen days, that all the inhabitants might have an opportunity of examination and objection.</P>
<P>The repeated delays of the king's marriage excited the anxiety of an affectionate people. In ca&s;e of his decea&s;e Al|bany, the next heir to the monarchy, was now advanced in years, and had no i&s;&s;ue; and the hou&s;e of Hamilton indulged warm hopes of &s;ucceeding to the throne, though perhaps at the expence of a civil war. That family was &s;trong in wealth, and va&s;&s;alage; and the imprudent youth of James expo&s;ed him to every danger. An a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in might a&s;&s;ail his life, while, in fatal &s;ecurity, he was attended by only one or two friends, on his nocturnal vi&s;its to his mi&s;tre&s;&s;es. Chance might perform the office of crime, while his courage expo&s;ed him to every danger. Often did he intru&s;t his per&s;on to every vici&s;&s;itude of the climate, pa&s;&s;ing days and nights on hor&s;eback, and &s;natch|ing a &s;canty and fortuitous meal: often did he &s;uddenly ru&s;h among de&s;perate bands of freebooters, attended only by a few &s;ervants, and the terror of the royal name<NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot">Buch.

But the emba&s;&s;adors were to re|&s;ide in France, till James &s;hould &s;end a decided mandate on the &s;ubject. Their mi&s;&s;ion was indeed chiefly a matter of pomp; for David Beton, who had remained in France, was the active negotiator, and by his abilities and addre&s;s overcame the Engli&s;h influence in the French cabinet<NOTE N="7" PLACE="foot">Le&s;l. 440.

He adds that &s;ome &s;aid James would de|mand the daughter of France; others that his ultimate reque&s;t would be Dun|bar, a &s;hip, and two or three hor&s;es&mdash;that James had &s;ent love-tokens to Loch-leven's wife (his former mi&s;tre&s;s,) and, as &s;ome report, would marry her&mdash;that none dared to mention a Douglas to him&mdash;that he admitted coun&s;el from none&mdash; that the earl of Moray contemptuou&s;ly enquired for Sir James Hamilton his minion, who, as James &s;aid, had failed in his duty&mdash;and that Moray mu&s;t be an enemy to James, el&s;e he could not di&s;play &s;uch malice in his conver&s;ations with the friends of Angus.
<P>In the &s;econd letter Penman mentions that many accu&s;ed Sir James Hamilton, and James &s;wore he &s;hould feel his vengeance; and that if he, the king, only looked on Angus, Hamilton would droop, "for by God's wounds when he and Angus met, Hamilton always turned the back &s;eams of his ho&s;e."

<P>Sir James Hamilton was now overwhelmed with di&s;grace, and Oliver Sinclair was already di&s;tingui&s;hed by the favour of his &s;overeign, and accompanied him on this expedition.

<P>In narrating &s;ome events of this year, which have been thought to throw an indelible &s;tain on the memory of James, the te&s;timony of Buchanan, an ear if not an eye witne&s;s, &s;hall be often followed; and he has the credit, notwith&s;tanding his enmity to kings, and to this monarch in particular, of having given the mo&s;t favourable account of tho&s;e tran&s;actions, evi|dently &s;hewing that the country and times looked with the eye of candour, if not approbation, upon incidents which religious or party zeal was afterwards to magnify into acts of the mo&s;t &s;anguinary de&s;poti&s;m.</P>
<P>It has already been narrated, amid the events of the preceding year, that John Forbes, the elde&s;t &s;on of lord Forbes, had been accu&s;ed of trea&s;on by Huntley. Buchanan &s;ays that one Strahan was the chief witne&s;s, a per&s;on of dubious reputation,

Arnot, in his Criminal Trials, &s;uppo&s;es that Forbes incurred enmity by being a prote&s;tant, becau&s;e Buchanan &s;ays he was "et magnae familiae, <HI>et factionis,</HI> princeps;" but <HI>factio</HI> al&s;o implies a clan, or any band of followers; and is by the cla&s;&s;ical writers always u&s;ed in a bad &s;en&s;e, &s;o that Buchanan, a prote&s;tant, &s;hould u&s;e it to point out his own &s;ect is not cre|dible. On the contrary he would have dwelled on Forbes's principles, and ex|tolled him as a martyr.

How|ever this be, the latter was tried by Argyle, the chief ju&s;tice, with the u&s;ual Scoti&s;h jury of fifteen; and in addition to the former charge of a de&s;ign to a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate the king, it was alledged that he was attached to England, and had engaged in a mu|tiny excited at Jedburgh, while the Scoti&s;h army was on its march to defend the borders again&s;t the Engli&s;h arms. Forbes a&s;&s;erted his innocence to the la&s;t hour,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Saturday 14 July</NOTE> but was found guilty and &s;uffered at Edinburgh the death of a traitor<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">O.

That James had no en|mity to Forbes is granted by all writers; and he was at the &s;ame time &s;o con&s;cious of his own integrity, that he admitted the brothers of the traitor to his favour, and one of them even into an office in his family<NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">Buch.

<PB N="347" REF="353">and the e&s;tate was unforfeited; &s;o that no appeal could have been made to avarice.</P>
<P>The fate of Forbes, long protracted, excited little attention, when compared with a concomitant, but, as far as appears, a totally detached event. Within a week after the death of Magdalen, while James was lo&s;t in the retirement of &s;orrow, the nation was amazed with the di&s;covery and puni&s;hment of another con&s;piracy again&s;t the life of their &s;overeign. The accu&s;er was one Lyon, who&s;e character even Buchanan does not pretend to impeach<NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot">Ibid. 54.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The per&s;on accu&s;ed by Lyon attracted more commi&s;eration, from the &s;ex, from the rank, and even from the puni&s;hment. Jane Douglas, &s;i&s;ter of Angus, widow of John Lyon lord Gla|mis, and wife of Archibald Campbell of Kepneith, was the unhappy victim. This lady, her hu&s;band, her &s;on the young lord Glamis, John Lyon his relation, and an old prie&s;t, were indicted for de&s;igns again&s;t the life of James, by poi&s;on, or witchcraft, with the intention of re&s;toring the hou&s;e of Angus. Lady Glamis was condemned to the flames, the &s;avage puni&s;h|ment of the imaginary crime of witchcraft;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tue&s;day 17 July</NOTE> and &s;uffered her fate on the ca&s;tlehill of Edinburgh, amid&s;t a croud of &s;pectators, who cea&s;ed not to admire her mature, yet youthful, elegance of form, and the ma&s;culine firmne&s;s of her mind<NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot">Buch.

Her &s;on, yet in extreme youth, was relea&s;ed but his lands were unju&s;tly detained in forfeiture<NOTE N="7" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>. Lyon, in remor&s;e, real or pretended, for the ruin of the chief of his family, endeavoured in vain to redeem the e&s;tate by avowing his accu&s;ation fal&s;e, as Buchanan relates; though it be difficult
<PB N="348" REF="354">in that ca&s;e to perceive how he could have e&s;caped the iron hand of the law.</P>
<P>There were al&s;o impri&s;oned, on account of tho&s;e trea&s;onable de&s;igns, lord Forbes, William Forbes his cou&s;in, the <HI>lards</HI> of Wedderburn, Whytingham, and Glaybarve, an e&s;quire named Hugh Douglas, Robert Douglas, Peter Carmichael, Mr. Da|vid Strahan, and &s;everal other per&s;ons<NOTE N="8" PLACE="foot">O.

<P>Such were tho&s;e tran&s;actions, over which &s;ome ob&s;curity yet remains. Le&s;ley briefly pa&s;&s;es the affair; and our prote&s;tant hi&s;torians in their enmity to James concur in denying the cri|minality of the &s;ufferers. They however allow that the king was deceived by accu&s;ers inflamed with per&s;onal enmity: and that he did not pardon is not &s;urprizing, when it is reflected that the chief cau&s;e of the di&s;orders in his kingdom aro&s;e from the lenity &s;hewn to crimes by his predece&s;&s;ors, and the regents, with whom money was often equal to innocence; a con&s;idera|tion which appears to have induced a vow, or re&s;olution, of James, never to pardon tho&s;e found guilty by the common cour&s;e of law. The king was accu&s;ed of indulging his ju&s;t enmity to the hou&s;e of Douglas in the puni&s;hment of lady Glamis: but with more ju&s;tice may our hi&s;torians be arraigned, for partiality to that family, a mo&s;t potent and popular name in Scotland. Yet a friend of the laws, of the public tranquil|lity, of the welfare of his country, will prefer the pacific vir|tues of the royal hou&s;e of Stuart to the turbulent fame of that
<PB N="349" REF="355">of Douglas; in foreign war the object indeed of admiration, but in dome&s;tic tranquillity, of the mo&s;t &s;evere cen&s;ure. That the king, after forgetting that lady Glamis was the &s;i&s;ter of Angus for no le&s;s than nine years after that earl's bani&s;hment, &s;hould &s;uddenly, and in the very cri&s;is of dome&s;tic and national affliction, exchange &s;entiments of &s;orrow for tho&s;e of ven|geance, &s;eems neither probable in it&s;elf, nor agreeable to the laws of human nature. Even his enemies allow him to have been mi&s;led by fal&s;e accu&s;ations: but it appears highly probable that the accu&s;ations were not fal&s;e. The retired life of lady Glamis, alledged as a proof of her innocence, might only afford more room for &s;ecret guilt; and the ignorance of her friends and &s;ervants would only argue her prudence. Witch|craft was in that age, and long after, firmly believed, and puni&s;hed by fire, even in the mo&s;t civilized countries in Eu|rope: nor is it a crime in James that he was not a philo&s;opher before philo&s;ophy was revived: perhaps the very death of the queen, which again left the king in a &s;olitude deprived of po&s;|terity, might have been by &s;uper&s;tition imputed to magic, and regarded as a pledge of her hu&s;band's danger. The con&s;pirators impri&s;oned on account of this la&s;t de&s;ign appear to have been all adherents of the hou&s;e of Douglas; Hume of Wedderburn was, by the mother, the nephew of Angus. That the earl was innocent may be admitted; but he was coun&s;elled by his brother Sir George Douglas, who&s;e known violence was cer|tainly capable of &s;uch a crime. James repeatedly expre&s;&s;es his apprehen&s;ions for his life, when he was kept in con&s;traint by the Dougla&s;es<NOTE N="9" PLACE="foot">Letters to Henry, 1528.</NOTE>; and in proceeding to the conflict of Linlith|gow Sir George openly menaced his per&s;on. The interce&s;&s;ion of Francis, during the re&s;idence of James in his dominions,

But Henry's avarice only &s;ent a pre&s;ent of a few hor&s;es to conciliate James, though he mu&s;t have known that the gold of France, and of the church, abounded in the Scoti&s;h court, and that it ought to have been balanced by a profu&s;ion, more laudably &s;hewn in &s;ecuring peace, than in maintaining war; though this was a truth which all his pa&s;t experience was never to teach him.

To the article concerning a league again&s;t England, James firmly, and it is believed mo&s;t ju&s;tly, denied any &s;uch intention, with &s;olemn a&s;&s;everations, and even with oaths. And Sadler having propo&s;ed a conference with Henry, the Scoti&s;h king objected, expect that Francis were al&s;o to be pre&s;ent, as was indeed the original propo&s;ition &s;ix years before.

<P>Some other points of this memorable emba&s;&s;y de&s;erve atten|tion.

The emba&s;&s;ador found that the king was well inclined, but was forced to u&s;e the council of the clergy, as the nobles wanted capacity<NOTE N="7" PLACE="foot">Ib. 61. Yet the clergy were &s;o gro&s;sly ignorant as to mi&s;take a Greek de|vice for Latin, and ludicrou&s;ly mi&s;interpret it, p. 63, 64.</NOTE>. Yet the churchmen were unpopular, e&s;pecially Beton who had recently i&s;&s;ued a proclamation ordaining the death of a heretic to any per&s;on who &s;hould eat an egg on forbidden days<NOTE N="8" PLACE="foot">Ib. 62.</NOTE>; as it is indeed the infatuation of a falling &s;y&s;tem to con&s;ider tri&s;les as barriers, and defend them with in&s;ane ob&s;tinacy: and it is thus that the ve|hemence of party drives the many to oppo&s;ite extremities of the field, while the wi&s;e and moderate few are left in the mid|dle expo&s;ed to the weapons of either &s;ide. The nobles and
<PB N="360" REF="366">gentlemen di&s;po&s;ed to the reformation Sadler found numerous, but chiefly in the younger cla&s;s of men<NOTE N="9" PLACE="foot">Ib. p. 61.

A ridiculous and affronting pro|po&s;ition, but &s;uch were Henry's methods of conciliation! James, p. 38, denied the charge, and &s;aid the &s;heep were kept by his tenants on his lands.

Lind&s;ay 237. Nor can any thing be more odious than to hear vice blaming virtue. Sadler had his fir&s;t audience when James was at ma&s;s, p. 24, a common practice with our monarchs ever formal in religion.

<P>The &s;ituation of James had become extremely difficult; and it is no wonder that he was &s;oon to fall a victim to the em|barra&s;&s;ment, as it might have confounded the mo&s;t aged and &s;killful politician.

No &s;overeign was ever more zealous for the benefit of his realm than James V, and his con&s;ent to the de&s;ired change would have proved, in the i&s;&s;ue, highly fortunate to him&s;elf and his people.

<P>James finding a determined and ruinous war to have com|menced, perceived too late that his conduct to the nobles had been the rever&s;e of that of his father, and that their unanimous concurrence, experienced by James IV, was not to be expected by a prince, who had, on repeated occa&s;ions, &s;acrificed their intere&s;ts to tho&s;e of the clergy. Many of the Scoti&s;h chiefs had al&s;o embraced the reformed doctrines; and the pre&s;ent being not unju&s;tly regarded as a war incited by the papal clergy again&s;t the chief &s;upporter of the new faith, it became an object of pious zeal to counteract its progre&s;s. In vain did James endeavour to recover the affections of the ari&s;tocracy; for he now countenanced the prie&s;ts, who gave in a new roll of pro&s;cription, and confi&s;cation, again&s;t the numerous pow|erful and wealthy heretics<NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">Keith, 12, from Knox, p. 31.</NOTE>.

The di&s;content of the peers ripened into murmurs, or was yet more dreadful from the deep &s;ilence which precedes a tempe&s;t. Their power had been irri|tated, not cru&s;hed, as that of the Engli&s;h lords by Henry VII. Their numerous &s;ollowers con&s;idered them&s;elves as only bound to the obedience of their chieftains; the regal name had no

On the contrary, the Engli&s;h battalions were not uninitiated by foreign wars in military tactics, and di&s;cipline; and any local attachments had been &s;o broken by the fall of ancient families, and by the pro|gre&s;s of civilization, that they moved as one ma&s;s at the voice of their general; and knew no fear, &s;ave that of di&s;honour, and the frown of their monarch.</P>

A murmur aro&s;e among the di&s;affected that this minion was nominated commander in chief: and the array, like a troubled &s;ea, was in&s;tantly agitated by uproar, tumult, and di&s;order.

<P>In the &s;ame curious MS. there occurs a letter from James to Henry, 30 Nov. in the thirtieth year of his reign 1542, on occa&s;ion of the murder of Somer&s;et herald, in Scotland, by William Leth and John Prei&s;tman Engli&s;h &s;ugitives, and who were immediately impri&s;oned by the command of James. He &s;hews every &s;en&s;e of the enormity of the action, terms it "an unhappy and cruel enterprize," and an "odious crime;" is earne&s;t that it &s;hall be puni&s;hed; and de&s;ires a &s;afe conduct to Lermont and Sir John Campbell, envoys to be &s;ent to receive Henry's in&s;tructions on the bu&s;ine&s;s. Herbert, p. 548, glances at this tran&s;|action, known to Hall and Stow; but I cannot find it in Le&s;ley, whom he quotes; nor in Drummond, who is cited by Dr. Granger the continuator of Maitland, Vol. II, p. 834.</P>
<P>The next letter in the MS. is from the council of Scotland, 21 Dec. 1542, acknowledging the receipt of Henry's letter of the 10th directed to James, who was dead before it arrived: and &s;urrendering the murderers to the ju&s;t vengeance of the Engli&s;h king. They pathetically urge the tender age of their new &s;ove|reign, "a babe incapable of good or harm," as an argument for peace.</P></NOTE>.</P>

<P>THAT paradoxical philo&s;ophy which &s;uppo&s;es man more happy in a &s;avage,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1488&mdash;1542</NOTE> than in a civilized condition, will never find converts among the &s;ons of &s;cience. To &s;olid in|formation, to enlarged views, to candid di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, to genuine ratiocination, the idea will ever appear a dream of ignorant genius, a vi&s;ion of the golden age of the ancient poets:
<Q><L>Di latte</L>
<L>Se'n cor&s;e il fiume, et &s;till&ograve; mele il bo&s;co.</L></Q>
Whether we peru&s;e the imperfect records of barbaric ages, or the page of the modern traveller, which delineates nations yet
<PB N="387" REF="393">in infancy, and repre&s;ents antiquities coeval with our&s;elves, the comparative mi&s;ery of the &s;avage will ever appear predo|minant. Few and in&s;ipid are his enjoyments, the animal plea&s;ures merely animal, unheightened by anticipation, by memory, by imagination, by the thou&s;and namele&s;s elegancies of civic life. To &s;eize his prey in the romantic fore&s;t, or pa&s;toral &s;tream, is not his amu&s;ement, but his occupation, filled with cares le&s;t his want of &s;ucce&s;s &s;hould leave him&s;elf and his family to famine. From the delays, &s;u&s;pence, and anxieties, of judicature he is free, but he is expo&s;ed to lawle&s;s violence; he defrays no taxes, but he enjoys no &s;ecurity of per&s;on nor property; his merit is not &s;uppre&s;&s;ed by the malice of party, the in&s;olence of office, nor the frigid frown of drop|&s;ical wealth, but it expires un&s;een and uncelebrated, like the flowers of his fore&s;ts. A &s;tranger if not to the mi&s;eries, yet to the unfeeling ridicule, which in mercantile &s;tates attends penury, he is equally a &s;tranger to that ea&s;e which opens and enlarges the mind to plea&s;ures before unknown, and is it&s;elf one con&s;tant enjoyment. Free from &s;ome of the cares of ci|vilized life, his uncultivated mind is expo&s;ed to all the fury of the pa&s;&s;ions. The day of puny conflict, the tortures of the captives, are fea&s;ts to his &s;anguinary di&s;po&s;ition; and if he die bravely, it is becau&s;e he feels that his exi&s;tence is mi&s;erable. In his eyes there is no providence, life and nature are a form|le&s;s ma&s;s without intelligence or plan; and he dies a &s;tranger to all the enlightened virtues, utilities, and decorations of life. If he expo&s;e his children to the wild bea&s;ts, or &s;ell them as &s;laves; if he bury his father alive, when too aged to procure his own &s;ub&s;i&s;tence; if he offer human victims to grim idols, &s;tigmatize his forehead with their blood, perhaps devour their fle&s;h, can we prai&s;e his mercy? If he take every opportunity to rob the &s;tranger, can we prai&s;e his hone&s;ty? If he be falla|cious
<PB N="388" REF="394">as uneducated infancy, can we applaud his truth? If his fe&s;tival be riot, his love brutal lu&s;t, where is his temperance? If he prefer a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination to open combat, where is the generous courage of a man? If his &s;trength oppre&s;s the weak, if his &s;ly cunning circumvent the unwary, where is his ju&s;tice? Where are his virtues, except in the want of opportunities of vice? Where in &s;hort are all the vaunted morals and enjoyments of the &s;avage, except in the theoretic page of fanciful philo&s;ophy?</P>
<P>But whether the &s;um of the contentment of the poor, for happine&s;s is too bold a word for human exi&s;tence, be greater in barbaric or in civilized ages is a different que&s;tion. Among our German ance&s;tors, when the whole produce of agriculture was equally divided among the tribe<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Tacit. Germ.</NOTE>, there could be no po&s;i|tive poverty, except it de&s;ervedly fell on the gambler, who would pledge his property, and &s;ometimes even his per&s;on, as a &s;take<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>. The chiefs, originally cho&s;en for their courage, wi&s;dom, and &s;uperior per&s;onal appearance and &s;trength, having a larger &s;hare in any warlike prey, became opulent in hor&s;es, herds, and flocks, the &s;ole wealth of the country, and epoch. Inheritance may be termed an innate idea among all nations; the &s;ons of the chiefs became rich in the fortune of their fa|thers; and di&s;tingui&s;hed by their opulence, and in time by the deeds of many ance&s;tors, they became kings, or nobles, of the &s;mall community. A further progre&s;s erected one king over a wide territory; and the former petty princes &s;ometimes were eradicated, &s;ometimes became only the barons of a more pow|erful &s;tate. But the barbarians, nations of &s;oldiers, either acquired their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence by prey, or by la&s;ting conque&s;ts, or by &s;haring the bounty of their chiefs; and the &s;laves alone could be termed poor.</P>
<PB N="389" REF="395">
<P>The u&s;age of &s;lavery among ancient nations prevented any occa&s;ion of beggary. In di&s;tre&s;s to become &s;laves, was the la&s;t refuge of the mi&s;erable; and their ma&s;ter provided objects for their indu&s;try, and &s;ub&s;i&s;tence for their lives. The chri&s;|tian &s;y&s;tem did not oppo&s;e this practi&s;e: the early chri&s;tians had their &s;laves<NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">Among other authorities &s;ee an in&s;cription in the Recherches &s;ur les Anti|quit&eacute;s de Vienne of Nicolas Chorier, Lyon, 1658, 12mo, p. 221.</NOTE>; and though the popes, in the ninth century, prohibited the Venetians to &s;ell believers as &s;laves to the Ma|hometans<NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">Ana&s;ta&s;ius vita Zachariae Papae, an. 747; Danduli Chron.

But modern charity would &s;hrink from the advice of a great political writer<NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot">Fletcher of Salton, Di&s;c. 2, on Scoti&s;h affairs, p. 87, edit. 1749.</NOTE>, to re&s;tore the cu&s;tom of &s;lavery as the only mean of deliverance from the recent evils of beggary and poors'-rates: an opulent manufacturer never &s;upporting the &s;ick, aged, or helple&s;s; while a rich Roman would not only employ five thou&s;and &s;laves, but furni&s;h an a&s;ylum for all in every &s;tage of exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>In a more immediate view of the pre&s;ent topic, it appears that the condition of the poor, as well as of the rich, is greatly ameliorated by civilization. New di&s;advantages, it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, ari&s;e; the population becomes &s;o numerous that the &s;ub&s;i&s;tence is of cour&s;e more difficult: and hardly, except in civilized &s;ociety, can the poor man &s;hun marriage, or execrate the increa&s;e of his family. But this defect may often ari&s;e from the fault of the governors, occupied in futile wars, factious plans, and the mi&s;erable chicane of office, in&s;tead of attending
<PB N="390" REF="396">to their &s;ole duty, the general welfare of the community. The poor however, in&s;tead of being the &s;laves of their landlords, are free to carry their indu&s;try and &s;kill to the be&s;t market, and &s;hare in the &s;ocial opulence: the uncertain life of a &s;oldier is exchanged for &s;ecurity, and comparative ea&s;e: their little pro|perty is &s;acred from violence: and they exult when they &s;ee the evening &s;moke a&s;cend from their cottages, and welcome their return from labour to a peaceful meal, and chearful fa|mily; nor can the rich forbear to envy their night's repo&s;e.
<Q>Man wants but little, nor that little long.</Q>
As the wants and wi&s;hes of the poor are but few and moderate, they have far more numerous opportunities of gratifying them in civilized, than in barbaric, &s;ociety: opulence opens the hand of charity, and the &s;tores of foreign commerce contribute to the wealth or comfort of the pea&s;ant; while the very &s;cenes ri&s;ing around him, the attic man&s;ion, the improved town, the na|vigable canal, not only encourage his indu&s;try, but increa&s;e his enjoyments; as it has been ob&s;erved that a Neapolitan <HI>lazarone</HI> would not exchange conditions with a Ru&s;&s;ian noble; &s;o much of the plea&s;ure of exi&s;tence is derived from &s;urrounding objects. And &s;uch is the influence of indu&s;try in advanced &s;ociety, that the poor enjoy conveniencies which, in a barbaric &s;tate, the great would account luxuries. Granting all human conditions comparative, we may e&s;timate the advantages of civilization by the voice of the &s;avage, and of the barbarian: what Engli&s;h &s;ailor, though expo&s;ed to the rage of enemies, and fury of the ocean, ever envied the American &s;avage? what Engli&s;h men|dicant, the rude Siberian? But the &s;avage chief will be proud to &s;hare the habiliments, or little luxuries, of the mariner; the Siberian would envy the dainty provi&s;ions, and luxurious ea&s;e, of the mendicant. By the &s;ame plan of providence, in which man ari&s;es from infancy to youth and maturity, from
<PB N="391" REF="397">which he is &s;oon to decline, human &s;ociety has its progre&s;&s;ive &s;tages of amelioration, till it attain the highe&s;t &s;tate, after which it tends to declen&s;ion.</P>
<P>The progre&s;s of Scotland towards civilization, during the reigns of James IV and V, appears to have been &s;omewhat more rapid than at any preceding period, though the minority of the latter prince formed a con&s;iderable interruption. The &s;tatute alone, of the former monarch, concerning education is worthy of an ancient legi&s;lator. But it concerns the rich only; and this &s;ection is devoted to the &s;tate of the middle ranks, and of the poor. Among the ordinances chiefly intended for their advantage, may be enumerated tho&s;e for the pre&s;ervation of the public peace again&s;t the inroads of the great; tho&s;e pro|hibiting the levying of <HI>capies,</HI> or pretended benevolences of hor&s;es, cattle, or the like, accu&s;tomed to be wre&s;ted from the poor by the landlords in Galloway and Carric<NOTE N="7" PLACE="foot">Acts, 1490, c. 8, 18, 19.</NOTE>.

Lands falling in ward are not to be injured; and the tenants, labourers, and other inhabitants, are not li|able to be removed till the expiration of their yearly lea&s;e, at the en&s;uing whit&s;unday: and all are permitted to &s;ell grain all the days of the week, as well as on the market day.

<P>But from other authorities it appears that great oppre&s;&s;ion of the farmers, and cottagers, &s;till prevailed; and the landlords
<PB N="392" REF="398">continued to prefer their pride to their intere&s;t. "The lords, &s;ays queen Margaret in a letter of Sept. 1523, regard not the di&s;a&s;ters of the poor, but laugh at them."

<P>John Mair in his de&s;cription of Scotland, 1521, pre&s;ents &s;ome particulars worthy of commemoration. He mentions Leith as the chief port, and ob&s;erves that, between it and Edinburgh, there was a &s;mall but rich village, famous for the woolen manufacture, and from which the be&s;t cloths in Scot|land derived their name. Perth was the only fortified town, the Scots being little ver&s;ed either in fortification, or &s;iege; but
<PB N="393" REF="399">di&s;playing great promptitude in repelling an enemy. The eccle&s;ia&s;tic polity was far inferior to that of England, there being often thirty hamlets attached to one pari&s;h church, di&s;tant from &s;ome of them four, five, or even ten miles: but every laird had his chapel and chaplain, and &s;ome more. The cures were few, but rich; and generally admini&s;tred by depu|ties. The hou&s;es of the farmes were &s;mall, becau&s;e they only rented by the year, at the mo&s;t for four or five; &s;o that, though &s;tone were common, there was no de&s;ire to erect good hou&s;es, to plant trees or hedges, or to enrich the ground; and Mair ju&s;tly expre&s;&s;es his regret for the con&s;equent lo&s;s, and di&s;grace, to the kingdom at large. He adds that if perpetual lea&s;es were granted, the rent might be tripled, and yet the tenants become rich; and the homicides which followed their removal be avoided, for a tenant of &s;pirit would kill his &s;ucce&s;&s;or to de&s;pite the lord. Nor would the lords have cau&s;e to alledge that, in ca&s;e of long lea&s;es, the tenants being independent would not ari&s;e with them in arms, for a law might pa&s;s ordaining in &s;uch defaults the lo&s;s of the lea&s;e: and better it were that the &s;uperiors could not &s;o &s;peedily recur to force. Mair repeats an advice of Robert the great on his death-bed, that the Scoti&s;h kings &s;hould attempt to retain all the i&s;les in their own hands, as abounding with cattle and warriors; and the detached go|vernment being mo&s;t pernicious to the intere&s;ts of the mo|narchy: the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors to be recompen&s;ed by other lands. He blames the farmers for their contempt of manufactures, and of citizens, whom they regarded as effeminate: while they, leaving the agricultural operations to &s;ervants, affected to ride con&s;tantly with their lords, perhaps a re&s;pect nece&s;&s;ary to &s;e|cure their brief lea&s;es. The nobles he equally cen&s;ures for perpetual feuds with their neighbours; and a complete neglect of the education of their &s;ons. Mair clo&s;es his intere&s;ting
<PB N="394" REF="400">remarks by de&s;cribing the highlanders as partly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of cattle and hor&s;es, of which la&s;t two or three hundred, wild and unbroken, would be brought by one highlander to Perth or Dundee, and &s;old for two franes each: but the others more &s;avage only hunted, or followed their chiefs, in their con&s;tant expeditions and conflicts. They wore <HI>caligae,</HI> or trou&s;e, reach|ing only to the middle of the leg, a mantle, and a &s;hirt &s;tained with &s;affron, their weapons a bow and arrows, a broad &s;word, &s;mall halbert, large dagger of one edge; armour, mail of iron rings: but the common people wore in battle jackets of quilted linnen, waxed or pitched, and covered with deer's &s;kin; while the lowlanders like the Engli&s;h fought in &s;hort clokes<NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;t. lib.

<P>There being no manufactures, the poor were chiefly occu|pied in the numerous menial trains of the great; or in the more u&s;eful employments of agriculture, and pa&s;turage.

<P>When &s;uch was the &s;tate of the lowlands, that of the high|lands was far more barbarous.

<P>SO ample a de&s;cription has been given of the Scoti&s;h con|&s;titution, in the preceding retro&s;pect, that little information can be added. A &s;tatute of 1493 continues to brand the go|vernment of James III, by repre&s;enting him as not only by evil coun&s;els lavi&s;hing away the royal domains, but as receiving re&s;ignations, and granting enfeofments, in prejudice of the righteous heirs<NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot">Cap. 50.</NOTE>. In 1490 a tax having been impo&s;ed to de|fray the expence of an emba&s;&s;y, it is ordered that the prelates a&s;&s;e&s;s the clergy: but that the &s;heriffs and royal bailiffs, having been often charged before by the king's letters, &s;hall in a week produce the quotas of the barons: and the provo&s;ts and bailies of burghs &s;hall pre&s;ent their portions on a &s;hort warning, under pain of impri&s;onment. It is added that as the lords in parlia|ment learn that letters of di&s;charge from the tax have been granted by the king to &s;ome prelates and peers, they are an|nulled; "as the king could not remit the tax, it being granted by the e&s;tates to the emba&s;&s;ador for an appointed purpo&s;e<NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot">Cap. 9.</NOTE>."

<P>So &s;low was the progre&s;s of government in Scotland, that the valuable memoir above quoted, written about 1590, may be &s;afely u&s;ed. It is there ob&s;erved that the king had no nega|tive in parliament, but the memoiri&s;t forgets the dangerous negative before debate, &s;ecured by the in&s;titution of the lords of the articles: that mo&s;t offices were hereditary even tho&s;e of the &s;heriffs, who not only execute <HI>res judicatas</HI> as in England, but judge in civil and criminal ca&s;es: that the lords of &s;e&s;&s;ion elected
<PB N="402" REF="408">their own members, and the king's recommendation was de&s;pi&s;ed: that the pardon of crimes was not a peculiar prero|gative of the crown, many peers exerting it in their hereditary judicatures: that the king cannot make peace, or war, but with the con&s;ent of the three e&s;tates: that in war the &s;ubjects only follow the king thirty days on their own provi&s;ions, and di&s;mi&s;s if no further conditions be &s;tipulated; hence they pro|tract the operations, and the nobles often ri&s;e in mutiny, having no reward nor intere&s;t in a &s;evere and unwilling &s;ervice. The writer adds that James III tore the earl of Morton's charter, becau&s;e it bore a juri&s;diction without any appeal to the king; but he was forced to &s;ew it. "Among the highlanders he &s;eemeth to have no more authority, than he can get by intere&s;t or force<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">MS. ut &s;upra.</NOTE>."</P>
<P>In this memoir the crown lands remaining at the time, are only e&s;timated at the yearly value of five thou&s;and pounds &s;terling. The exports are &s;tated at two hundred thou&s;and pounds; and the cu&s;toms were of cour&s;e &s;mall, perhaps about twenty thou&s;and pounds, Scoti&s;h money, a year. The confi&s;ca|tions and ward&s;hips were boldly claimed by the nobles, as &s;oon as they fell: and while their own revenues were far too large, in proportion either to tho&s;e of the king or commons, they greedily gra&s;ped at the &s;canty royal income, which it ought to have been their duty and honour to enlarge.</P>
<P>Lind&s;ay in his play written about 1540, points out many reforms nece&s;&s;ary in the government: that all the temporal lands be let in feu-farm, after the French form, or a &s;occage tenure free from military &s;ervice: that the lords &s;hould not &s;upport robbers to oppre&s;s the poor: that a &s;enate of ju&s;tice be appointed at Elgin or Inverne&s;s, for the northern regions, as well as that at Edinburgh for the &s;outhern: that no temporal
<PB N="403" REF="409">&s;uit be brought before eccle&s;ia&s;tic courts: that no benefices be a&s;&s;igned, except to learned eccle&s;ia&s;tics who can preach: that none &s;hall purcha&s;e benefices either from the pope or the king: that the vicars be debarred from robbing the poor, on pretence of <HI>cor&s;e-pre&s;ents,</HI> and the like: that the clergy &s;hall re&s;ide: that except in the ca&s;es of the archbi&s;hoprics no money pa&s;s to Rome for bulls of confirmation, as neither Peter nor Paul ever drew money in that net: that prie&s;ts may marry: that no barons wed the ba&s;tard daughters of the rich clergy<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Scoti&s;h Poems, 1792, Vol. II, p. 254&mdash;259.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The magnificence of the court of James IV rather corre&s;|ponded with his mind, than with his revenue: and the new profe&s;&s;ion of courtier &s;eems fir&s;t to dawn in his reign.

On the acqui&s;ition of the Hebudes, as before &s;tated, that monarch gave a more appropriated title to his elde&s;t &s;on, than the diminutive &s;tyle of duke of Roth&s;ay, that of prince of Scotland and of the I&s;les<NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">Carta J.

<P>The ancient court of &s;e&s;&s;ion, con&s;i&s;ting of committees of parliament, if it rather &s;leeped during the reign of James III, was revived by his &s;on; for in 1504 the court of daily council was created, "becau&s;e there has been great confu&s;ion of &s;um|monds at every &s;e&s;&s;ion," &s;o that lei&s;ure or opportunity would not &s;erve to terminate them at one &s;itting in the year, and the poor thus wanted ju&s;tice; therefore a daily council is appointed
<PB N="404" REF="410">to &s;it continually at Edinburgh, at the royal re&s;idence, or where the king &s;hall chu&s;e, to decide all civil cau&s;es, "and have the &s;ame power as the lords of &s;e&s;&s;ion<NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">Cap. 58.</NOTE>."

The meaning of this &s;tatute &s;eems to have been to prevent contraband trade on the we&s;tern coa&s;t; the ea&s;tern being replete with free burghs here unmentioned. The prohibition of navigation between the days of All Saints, and Candlemas is reinforced. In 1493 it was enacted that, as foreign ve&s;&s;els often eluded the cu&s;toms, the ma&s;ters and mer|chants &s;hould lodge in the chief ports; and their landlords be an&s;werable for their conduct<NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">1490, c. 14, 1493, c. 41.</NOTE>.</P>

<P>The &s;tate of the Scoti&s;h coinage was greatly improved by James V; the gold in particular is of elegant form, and &s;upe|rior workman&s;hip, &s;o as to vie with mo&s;t coins in Europe of the time. His father had, in the parliament of 1488, ordered

<P>When Angus had the chief power, in the minority of James V, he i&s;&s;ued a large groat, called the Douglas groat, if we believe Lind&s;ay, which pa&s;&s;ed for eighteen pence Scoti&s;h, or four pence halfpenny Engli&s;h currency<NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;t. p. 206.</NOTE>.

<P>The progre&s;s of literature during this period was con&s;ider|able. Of the poems of &s;ir John Ro&s;s, probably a prie&s;t, Stobo, and Quintin Shaw, mentioned by their contemporary Dunbar, few reliques have yet appeared. Dunbar him&s;elf flouri&s;hed in the reign of James IV, and minority of his &s;ucce&s;&s;or; and is de&s;ervedly &s;tyled the chief of the ancient Scoti&s;h poets, his language and imagery being wonderful for the time. Nor is Gawin Douglas, bi&s;hop of Dunkeld, much inferior; the great merit of his tran&s;lation of Virgil yielding to the original pro|ductions of his genius. Kennedy flouri&s;hed about the year 1490; and Robert Henry&s;on compo&s;ed his apologues about the year 1500. James Inglis, denominated <HI>Sir,</HI> becau&s;e he was a dig|nified prie&s;t, &s;ecretary to queen Margaret, and afterwards abbot of Culros, was &s;lain in 1531, as mentioned in the hi&s;|torical department; and is celebrated by Lind&s;ay for his ballads, farces, and plays. Kyd, Stewart, and another Stewart of Lorn, Galbreth, and Kinloch, are more known by the prai&s;e of &s;ir David Lind&s;ay, than by the remains of their productions.

<P>PLEAS it your good lord&s;hips to haue in remembrance, that at Grenewiche, in the moneth of Decembre was two yeares, where as the King of Scotts, of his malicious and untrew purpo&s;&s;e, was aboutward to haif &s;tollen the Town of Berwyke, My Lord Darcy wold not be Wardain of the E&s;t and middell marchies, but upon unre&s;onable &s;ommes of money be hym de&s;yred. And for becau&s;e it was a momring tyme, not plainly determyned warr, but that they laye alwey in awayte of untrouthe, as is proved by the &s;aid King of Scotts, I toke upon haunde to be Wardain of the E&s;t and middill marchies, unto the ffea&s;t of E&s;tre then next en&s;ueing; and furthir of the pes continewed at our Soueraine Lords plea&s;ure, as in thendentes therupon made more largely doth appere. At whiche tyme, in the Kyngs Inner chambre, I maide reque&s;t unto your Lord&s;hips, that yf any &s;urmy&s;es were maide on me to the Kings grace, or you my lords of his mo&s;t honorable coun&s;aill, that noo credence &s;huld be taken therat, unto I had maide myn aun|&s;uer, whiche your Lord&s;hips did fully promy&s;e me.</P>
<P>Now I am enformed that mi&s;reporte is maide, and put in to the Kings grace, and.....me &s;pecifieing that, ina&s;muche as I am war|dainn of the Marchies, and has the hole authorite in my hands undre the Kings grace, the Scotts have and daily doth di&s;tres the Kings bordours, and &s;ubgietts, without any great hurte is done again unto them. And al&s;o that diuer&s;e metings has bene betwixt me and the Chamberlain, of which I have not adverti&s;ed the Kings grace, nor you. And over that I make not &s;o good e&s;piall in Scotland as I might.</P>
<P>My Lords, &s;ens my beyng with the King's highnes at Winde&s;ore, in Decembre la&s;t pa&s;&s;ed, I neyther try&s;ted ne mett the Chamberlain of Scotland, &s;ave oonys in ffebruary la&s;t, that I mett hym at Coklawe upon the middill marche, at the in&s;tant de&s;ire of &s;undry our Souveraine lords &s;ubgietts, for the ran&s;omyng and getting to liberte their kynne&s;|men and freynds, beyng pre&s;oners, lyke as I certified the Kings grace by......as apperes in oone article emongs other in my lettre, dated at Morpathe in the moneth of Marche; the copie wherof my fellowe Doctor Conyers, this berer, &s;hall &s;hewe unto you. A&s;&s;uring your Lord&s;hips that I had non othre meting with hym, ne with non othre Scot in Scotland, for non othre matier or cau&s;e, prevely or opinly, as I woll aun&s;were the Kings grace, and you upon my lyf, launds, and goods.

<PB N="460" REF="467">and you, my lords, when as ye woll commande me to com to your pre&s;ence.</P>
<P>My Lords, has for any intelligence, famuliarite, or kyndne&s;&s;e, that is betwyxt me and the Chamberlayn, truely I know non; for in the felde of Brank&s;ton it fortuned that I, and my freynds beyng in my hoo&s;e and companye, met the erle of Huntley, and the Chamberlain, and encountred to gidders. Where as Sir John Home, Sir Will^m. Cobkurne of Langton Knights, Cuthbert Home of Fa&s;tca&s;tell, the &s;on and heir of Sir John Home, the &s;on and heir of Sir William Cok|burn, the Son and Heir of Sir David Home, the larde of Blacater, William Carr, and thre brethren of the Bromfelds, Gentilmen, with many othur kynnesfolks, freynds, and &s;eruaunts, of the &s;aid Chamber|lain's, were &s;layne be me, and my folks; and my Broder Philip Dacre taken pre&s;oner, with many other my kynnesfolk, &s;eruants, and tennants, taken and &s;layne in the &s;aid battel, as is well knowen.</P>
<P>And has for any intelligence had with any Scot in Scotland, I a&s;&s;ure your Lord&s;hips of trouthe I haue non, as &s;halbe &s;ufficiently proved; for they love me wor&s;t of any Ingli&s;heman living, be rea&s;on that I fande the body of the King of Scotts, &s;layne in the felde, and therof aduerti&s;ed my lord of Norfolke be my writing; and therupon I brought the Corps to Berwyke, and deliuered it to my &s;aid lord: at which tyme as I was intreated in my &s;aid lord's pre&s;ence, be oone Langton of Berwyk, I reaporte me to his Lord&s;hip, and as yit it is nat punys&s;hed.</P>
<P>And where it is thought I make not &s;oo good e&s;piall in Scotland, as I might doo. My Lords I a&s;&s;ure your Lord&s;hips, that I maide the be&s;t e&s;piall at all tymes hiddertoward, and &s;hall maike in tyme to com, that I oder can or may unfenydly, and neithre &s;pare for co&s;t ne charge. And alway, as I gatt any certain matier worthy writing, I certified the Kings highne&s;&s;e, or you, by po&s;t in euery behalf at lienth, as apperes more largely by the copies of the &s;ame lettres, whiche my &s;aid fellowe has to &s;hewe your Lord&s;hips.</P>
<P>My lords, there is &s;oo great brutilne&s;&s;e, mutabilite, and in&s;tablene&s;s, in the coun&s;aill of Scotland, that truely noo man can or may tru&s;t them, or there &s;ayngs and devi&s;es, without it be of things concluded and determined at a parliament &s;ea&s;on, or generall coun&s;aill of the Lords &s;pirituall and temporall. Of whiche determined mynds and purpo&s;es, from tyme to tyme, as often as they have &s;ittin, and as fere as I couthe gitt knowlege be myn e&s;pies, or otherwi&s;e, I certified the Kings grace or you, as is aforewrittin.</P>
<P>To have daily acombred the Kings grace, or you, in &s;ending up writings be pooftis of tryffills, and flieng tailes of noo certanty, like as I &s;uppo&s;e other has done, to no litell co&s;t and charges of the Kings grace, I wold have bene loth to have done.</P>
<PB N="461" REF="468">
<P>And as unto the di&s;truccion of the King's bordours and &s;ubgietts, without any great hunte done again unto them, Right harde and im|po&s;&s;ible it is for &s;uche a poure Baron as I am, to make re&s;i&s;tence and kepe the Kings &s;ubgietts and there goods in &s;uretie, all along the E&s;t, middill, and We&s;t Marchies, again&s;t the hole power of the Realme of Scotland, without great help and a&s;&s;i&s;tance; where as in tymes pa&s;&s;ed the Duke of Glouce&s;tre, beyng a Kyngs Broder, and therll of Northumbrelond, with there great powers, couth not well kept them, but ever di&s;troyed. And as my Lord of Norfolk and my Lord of Winche&s;tre knowes that, in the la&s;t werr, when as they both laye upon the E&s;t bordours, with the ayde and a&s;&s;i&s;tence of the hole marchies; what bu&s;ines and payne they toke on them, and had, I doubt not they can reaporte. And over that I doubt not but your Lord&s;hips remembreth, that at my &s;aid beyng with you, I &s;hewed you that I had no &s;trienth ne help of men, freynds, ne tennants, within the &s;ame E&s;t Marchies, that wold ayde and a&s;&s;i&s;t me to &s;erue the Kings grace; ffora&s;miche as Berwyke, Bamburgh&s;hyre, and Dun&s;tanceburghe, with Sir Roger Grey power, is in my lord Darcy haunds and reull.

<P>And as to the de&s;truccion of the &s;ame E&s;t Marchies, &s;ens my &s;aid beyng with hys highnes la&s;t, I a&s;&s;ure your Lord&s;hips there is not iiii^x^x how&s;is, and cotags burnt, which by e&s;timacion exceds not the &s;ome and value of xl li. at the vttermo&s;t.

<P>And as unto the &s;tate of the We&s;t and Middill Marchies, beyng drye bordours from Bownes to Hanging&s;tane, conteignyng l. Myles in lienth, as the bordours goeth, where as euery per&s;on of hor&s;bak or foote may ryde and enter at there plea&s;ures.

And as the ca&s;e &s;tandeth, ther be many friends conformed with thair favors, and devocion to the &s;aid Erle of Anguis&s;he.

<P>IN the fir&s;te entres come in SOLAICE (who&s;e parte was but to make mery, &s;ing Balletts with his ffellowes, and drinke at the interluyds of the play,) whoe &s;hewede fir&s;te to all the Audiance the play to be played, whiche was a generall thing, meanying nothing in &s;peciall to di&s;pleas noe man, praying therfor no man to be angre with the &s;ame.
<PB N="496" REF="503">NEXTE come in a King, whoe pa&s;&s;ed to his throne, having noe &s;peche to thende of the play; and thene to ratifye and approve, as in playne parliament, all things doon by the re&s;te of the players whiche repre|&s;ented the three e&s;tates. With hym come his courtiers, PLACEBO, PIKTHANKE, and FLATERYE, and &s;uche alike garde: one &s;wering he was the lu&s;tie&s;te, &s;tarke&s;te, be&s;t proportionet, and mo&s;t valiaunte man, that ever was. An other &s;wear he was the be&s;te with longe bowe, Cro&s;ebowe and Culveren, in the world. An other &s;were he was the be&s;te Ju&s;ter, and man of armes in the world; and &s;oe furthe during thair partes. THER AFTER came a man, armed in harnes, withe a &s;werd drawen in his hande, A BUSSHOPE, A BURGES man, and EXPE|RIENCE, clede like a Doctor: whoe &s;ete thaym all down on the Deis, under the KING. After thayme come a POOR MAN, whoe did goe upe and downe the &s;caffald, making a hevie complaynte that he was heryed throughe the Courtiers taking his fewe in one place, and, after, his tacks in an other place; wher throughe he had &s;cayled his hou&s;e, his wife and childeren beggying thair brede; and &s;oe of many thou|&s;ound in Scotlande, whiche wolde make the KYNG's grace lo&s;e of men if his grace &s;tod neide. Saying thair was noe remedye to be gotten, for thoughe he wolde &s;uyte to the King's grace, he was naither ac|quaynted with Controuller not Trea&s;ourer; and withoute thaym myght noe man gete noe goodene&s;s of the King. And after he &s;pered for the King; and whene he was &s;hewed to the MAN that was KING in the playe, he aun&s;uered and &s;aid he was noe King, for ther is but one King, whiche made all and gouernethe all; whoe is eternall; to whome he and all ertheley Kings ar but officers; of the whiche thay mu&s;te make recknyng. And &s;o furthe much meere to that effecte. And thene he looked to the KING, and &s;aide he was not the King of Scotlande, for ther was an other King in Scotlande that hanged John Arme&s;trang with his fellowes, and Sym the Larde, and many other moe, which had pacified the countrey, and &s;tanched thi&s;te. But he had lefte one thing undon, whiche pertaynede a&s;well to his charge as thother. And whene he was a&s;ked what that was, he made a long narracion of the oppre&s;&s;ion of the poor, by the taking of the Cor&s;e pre&s;aunte bei&s;ts; and of the herying of poor men by the Con&s;i&s;torye lawe, and of many other abu&s;&s;ions of the Spiritualtie, and churche; with many long &s;tories and auctoraties.</P>
<P>And then the BUSSHOPE roi&s;e, and rebuked hym, &s;aying it effered not to hym to &s;peake &s;uch matiers; commaunding to hym &s;cilence, or ells to &s;uffer dethe for it, by thair lawe. Therafter roi&s;e the MAN OF ARMES, alledginge the contrarie, and commaunded the POOR MAN to &s;peake, &s;aying their abu&s;ion hade been over longe &s;uffered, withowte any lawe. Thene the POOR MAN &s;hewed the grete abu&s;ion of Bus&s;hopes, Preletts, Abbotts, reving mens Wi&s;s, and Doughters, and
<PB N="497" REF="504">holding thaym; and of the maynteynyng of thair Childer; and of thair over bying of lords and Barrons Elde&s;te &s;ones, to ther Doughters, wher throughe the nobilitie of the Blode of the Realme was degenerate. And of the greate &s;uperfluous Rents that pertayned to the churche, by rea&s;on of over muche temporall lands given to thaym; which thaye proved that the Kinge might take, boothe by the Canon Lawe, and Civile Lawe. And of the greate abomynable vices that Reiagne in clo&s;tures; and of the common bordelles that was keped in Clo&s;tures of Nunies. All this was prouit by EXPERIENCE. And al&s;oe was &s;hewed THOFFICE of a Bus&s;hope, and producit the Newe Te&s;tament, with the auctorities to that effecte. And thene roi&s;e the MAN OF ARMES, and the BURCES; and did &s;aye that all that was producit, by the POOR MAN and EXPERIENCE was rea&s;onable, of veritie, and of greate effecte; and very expedient to be reaformed withe the con&s;ent of parliament. And the BUSSHOPE &s;aid he wold not con&s;ent thereunto. The MAN OF ARMES and BURGES &s;aid they were twoe, and he but one, wherfor thair voice &s;huld have moo&s;te effecte.

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE KING has not a negative in making Laws, but mu&s;t ratifie what is agreed by the plurality of votes: his authority is &s;ummoning, and di&s;&s;olving, the parliament. And in publi&s;hing their Laws, they are content that the Prince u&s;e more &s;hew and flouri&s;h of authority, in the preface to their Laws, than indeed he has, as in the Laws of <HI>Re|giam maje&s;tatem.</HI> Many of the Magi&s;trates and publique officers are not of the King's creating, but hereditary; as the Con&s;table&s;hip, Mare&s;chal&s;hip, Admiraltie, Shereffship; the latter not only execute the <HI>res judicatas,</HI> as with us, but judge them&s;elves both in Civil and Criminal matters. Be&s;ides the Lords of Se&s;&s;ion at Edinburgh are ap|pointed by them&s;elves; and tho&s;e recommended to the King may be put off from the Bench. Pardon and Execution in matters Criminal, is not peculiar to the crown; for diver&s;e of the nobility have <HI>Jus Here|ditarium</HI> in matters criminal, to execute and pardon, within their precincts, as ab&s;olutely as the King. The Prince has not ab&s;olute authority in making Leagues or War, but mu&s;t have the con&s;ent of the E&s;tates; the &s;ubjects at fir&s;t are only obliged to follow their King 30 days upon their own provi&s;ion, unle&s;&s;e they agree it by a new Con|vention; this be&s;ides the le&s;&s;ening the Prince's authority, gives cau&s;e to mutinies between the Prince and his nobles, and advantage to the ...... by protracting the time ...... which lie not univer|&s;aly to the Prince for &s;everal of the nobility hold and execute ..... Ju&s;tice ab&s;olutely without appeal to the Prince, within their Juri&s;dictions by Charter ...... which the Prince cannot avoid nor take from them. As for example, in the Earl of Mortoun's Charter, which king James the 3d tare openly in Parliament, offended with the Clau&s;es of it, e&s;pecially with this point of no appellation to the Prince, adding that the Prince him&s;elf could have no more. But before he removed from the place where he tare it, he was forced by the nobility to &s;it down, and &s;ew it up again with his own hands; wherefore it is called <HI>the &s;ewed Charter.</HI> Be&s;ides &s;entence of the Lords of the Se&s;&s;ion is peremptory, and not remi&s;&s;able by the Prince, &s;aveing where it con|cerneth
<PB N="502" REF="509">his own private. The&s;e limitations doth he &s;uffer in the more Southerly parts; among the Highlanders he &s;eemeth to have no more authority than he can get by intere&s;t or force.</P>

<P><HI>Cu&s;tomes,</HI> which cannot be great, by rea&s;on of the &s;mall exportation which the country yieldeth, as Fi&s;h, Salt, Hides, which amounts in the whole but to &pound;. 200, 000, per ann. <HI>ex Relatione Con&s;ervatoris publici,</HI> the Cu&s;tom whereof cannot be ........<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Blank in original.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><HI>Impo&s;t,</HI> now a&s;&s;ayed of late to have a Scotti&s;h &s;hilling of each Tun, but was refu&s;ed with grudging and almo&s;t mutiny.</P>
<P><HI>Confi&s;cations and Ward&s;hips,</HI> which are claimed for the mo&s;t part im|periou&s;ly by the nobility when they fall. The confi&s;cations are anni|hilated, or returned, as the factions prevail; whereby litle cleaveth to the King's Exchequer in the End.</P>
<P><HI>Mines of Lead</HI> farmed to one Cu&s;tome, whereof no profit cometh yet to the King. Of Gold and Silver ther is great likelyhood, &amp;c.&mdash;Some doubt if the mines ...... to the King, becau&s;e of the word in the noblemens Charters viz. to have and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;e their Land, <HI>a &s;ummo Caelo u&s;que ad imos Inferos.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Church Lands,</HI> where little or nothing cometh to the Crown at the di&s;&s;olution of them, but were divided among&s;t their nobility by the authority of Parliament, holding their ..... that the King's Re|venue mu&s;t not be increa&s;ed.</P>
<P><HI>Tenths,</HI> in lieu thereof, the Prince has the 3d of &s;uch benefices as exceed &pound;. 300 per ann. Scotch money, which are few, except tho&s;e which appertain to Abbies, &amp;c. which re&s;erve their Immunities; whereby the commodity cannot be great, the number of all the Bene|fices in Scotland not exceeding 900.</P>
<P><HI>Tax and Impo&s;ition,</HI> in the Southern parts, where they have money, and the people acknowledge &s;ome more duty, is impo&s;ed &s;ometimes for the King's relief, but the Soum is very &s;mall. The State &s;eemeth &s;omething like the Lacedemonian Mula, but &s;omewhat wor&s;er &s;ett, for that the King and Ephori amongs the Lacedemonians had their autho|rity determined, and well agreed upon; here it is uncertain, and under continuall contentions, jealou&s;ies, and emulations, and their Parliament le&s;&s;e orderly than the Senate of the Ephori; whereby great inconveni|ence groweth to their Commonwealth, whil&s;t their Kings, who are commonly men of good &s;pirit, contend with the nobility about autho|rity, and would fain enlarge them&s;elves, which &s;eemeth to have co&s;t
<PB N="503" REF="510">many a King's life among them. And in the mean while Order and Di&s;cipline in their Commonwealth fadeth loo&s;e betwixt both the autho|rities of Prince and nobility, whil&s;t they follow factions and particu|larities. Be&s;ides this con&s;titution of their Commonwealth, the want of money and reverence cau&s;eth the want of authority in the Prince, both to keep that in Order which he hath, and to recover that which he hath not.</P>

<HEAD>Exce&s;s in proportion of the Nobility.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Number,</HI> which being more than &s;o &s;mall a kingdom can well <HI>bear, viz. more than in England, and their Country much le&s;&s;e</HI> and le&s;&s;e fertile, mu&s;t breed great inconvenience to their Commonwealth. And, fir&s;t, to eclip&s;e and over&s;hadow the Prince's authority. 2^d^$, To make the Government more heavy upon his hand, by rea&s;on &s;o many of the mightier &s;ort. Thirdly, to overcharge the Country, and make le&s;&s;e the proportion for the other E&s;tates in their Ranks and Degrees, viz. for the Prince and for the Commons, whil&s;t all the&s;e mu&s;t have to maintain their Degrees and Nobility. Fourthly, it layeth the State open to Divi&s;ion and faction, by means of Envies, Emulation, &amp;c. about particularities, for honor, and Commodities; which doth and mu&s;t fall out, where are &s;o many great ones in &s;o nar|row room.</P>
<P><HI>Authority of the Peers,</HI> fir&s;t they are all born Coun&s;ellours to the State. 2dly, in the Legi&s;lature, Leagues, Peace and War, making officers, determining in high Ju&s;tice, and other matters of State, their Authority is joint and nece&s;&s;ary with the Prince's, and more than can &s;tand in a ju&s;t Monarchy; the more becau&s;e mo&s;t Burrows are at the devotion of &s;ome Noblemen, as Cowper in Fiffe manag'd by the Earl of Rothes, Perth by Montro&s;e, Dundee by Crawfurd, all the North|ern Towns at the Earl of Huntley's command: whereby they have both their own and their Commons vote in Parliament, and &s;o nothing can pa&s;&s;e to prejudice the E&s;tate of the Nobility, or enlarge the Prince's. Their authority over their Tenents, Clients, and Va&s;&s;als, is &s;o great, that they regard more their Patron or Noblemen as their Prince. The rea&s;ons whereof are, fir&s;t, in publick matters their Autho|rity is &s;o great. Secondly, for that the whole Country hath few or no freeholders, but &s;uch as hold at the Lord's plea&s;ure from year to year; whereby they are made thralld and obnoxious to him, having their whole e&s;tate and living depending on their Lords, and &s;o are made &s;ervile, and at his commandment life and all.</P>
