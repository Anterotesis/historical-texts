<HEAD>A True and Faithful ACCOUNT OF THE <HI>CENTAUR,</HI> &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>_'TIS with the greate&s;t Satisfac|tion, that the Proprietors of Mr. <HI>Jehan-Paul-Erne&s;t-Chri|&s;tian-Lodowic Manpferdt,</HI> the wonderful Centaur, can at length inform the Publick, that, after all the Difficulties, Expences and Delays they have met with, in their At|tempts to oblige their Country with the Sight of &s;o great a Curio&s;ity, he is arriv'd &s;afe in Town, and will be ready to be exhi|bited to the Publick View, at the Sign of the <HI>Golden Cro&s;s</HI> at <HI>Charing-Cro&s;s,</HI> on the Day of next Month.</P>
<P>Such a Wonder as this (the like of which has not, in all Probability, been produc'd
<PB N="4" REF="4">
by Nature, for near Three Thou&s;and Years la&s;t pa&s;t, (at lea&s;t as to Two Thou&s;and, it may be affirm'd with pretty great Certainty, if there is any in Hi&s;tory) after having been for &s;ome time the Admiration of mo&s;t of the Courts in <HI>Europe,</HI> and for no little Time the Conver&s;ation of all the Learned in <HI>Great-Britain;</HI> cannot &s;ail rai&s;ing the Expectation of all the Cu|rious. As the Proprietors pre&s;ume &s;o uncommon a Sight will undoubtedly draw together as great a Concour&s;e of Nobility, Gentry and others, as any thing of this Sort that has been &s;hewn in the Memory of Man, they have thought it nece&s;&s;ary for them to take this Method of acquainting the Publick, beforehand, with &s;uch Particu|larities concerning it, as they imagine every one will be curious to enquire after, but &s;up|po&s;e to be impo&s;&s;ible for them to give any tolerable Satisfaction in, during the Hurry of Shewing; be&s;ides, they found it began to be time for them to contradict, in an authen|tic Manner, the many fabulous Accounts of the Centaur which have been, it &s;eems, indu&s;triou&s;ly &s;pread, by certain Per&s;ons, gifted with &s;o unaccountable a turn of Mind, as to find greater Satisfaction in their own idle Inventions than from any Information of Truth. We will not pretend po&s;itively to charge the&s;e fal&s;e Reports, however liable to Su&s;picion it may appear, upon the Own|ers
<PB N="5" REF="5" MS="Y">
of the Panopticon, Colo&s;&s;us, Sea-Lione&s;s, <HI>Chien Scavant,</HI> &amp;c. but be they who they will, if they could be guilty of &s;o much Malice, as to hope to deter the Propri$tors from producing to the World the greate&s;t Wonder perhaps in it, after acquiring it at &s;o great an Expence, they deceived them|&s;elves; for if Lies, Difficulties or Delays could have effected that, they mu&s;t have given over their Project, &s;o long ago as the la&s;t Year of the late War, when, after they had convey'd thro' <HI>Holland,</HI> as far as <HI>Wil|liam&s;tadt,</HI> and were actually weighing Mr. <HI>Manpferdt</HI> into the Ship, to their great Surpri&s;e and Mortification, an Embargo was laid upon them, under colour of their de&s;igning to act contrary to an Order of the States, in &s;hipping him without paying Duty for him, as a Hor&s;e; which tho' perhaps it might have bore a Di&s;pute, could never have been worth their while to have attempted; but when the real ca&s;e appear'd upon enquiry to be, that a certain potent Prince the <HI>Dutch</HI> are &s;uppos'd to &s;tand in &s;ome awe of, was determin'd to force Mr. <HI>Manpferdt</HI> to &s;erve in his Army as a Trooper, the Proprietors thought them&s;elves oblig'd to make U&s;e of the Means God had put into their Hands, of &s;ecuring his Per&s;on to them&s;elves for the Time he had made him|&s;elf their Property; for which Rea&s;on, they are not a&s;ham'd to own, they had Thoughts
<PB N="6" REF="6">
of getting him convey'd to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Coa&s;t aboard a Smuggler, but he telling them very hone&s;tly, he would not undertake to deliver him &s;afe, as the general Election was over, they thought it would be run|ning too great a Ri&s;que for &s;o valuable a Cargo. They next thought of embarking him aboard an <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Ve&s;&s;el that lay in the Road, but the Captain had no &s;ooner &s;een Mr. <HI>Manpferdt</HI> than he ab&s;olutely declared off the Bargain he had before made, &s;aying, with an unaffected Concern they could never learn the Motive of, his Nation would never forgive him if he a&s;&s;i&s;ted in it, and he wi&s;h'd none of his Countrymen might owe our Centaur a Spight, or do him a Mi&s;chief, if ever we came to make him publick. Upon this Second Baulk, they were forc'd to put the only remaining Scheme they could think of into Execution, which was to convey him aboard in a great Che&s;t, under the Name of Artillery for the <HI>French,</HI> in which they met with no Difficulty, the whole Peo|ple a&s;&s;i&s;ting them; but the Captain of the Ship, who was <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> as well as his Ship, outwitted them, for having actually a Lading of Artillery for the <HI>French</HI> on board (which they thought he had only pretended, in order to facilitate their De&s;ign) he delivered them all up together at <HI>St. Malo</HI>'s, from which Place it was with the greate&s;t Diffi|culty they ever redeemed him. After hav|ing
<PB N="7" REF="7">
&s;urmounted all this, and a great deal more, they little expected to have found their Con&s;ciences charg'd at home (as they have very lately done) by a Letter &s;igned <HI>Whit|field,</HI> be&s;eeching them by every thing they hold &s;acred, and as they will an&s;wer it in Ca&s;e of Failure, to forego the Advantage they may have propo&s;ed to them&s;elves, by expo&s;ing their Centaur as a Shew, which the Writer more than fears will be giving an Encouragement to the mo&s;t horrid Vices, among the fine Gentlemen of the Age, to which (he &s;ays) they are already only too much addicted; if not a Means of introducing new ones, to which they may be the proner, from an Appearance of Utility. He owns his Apprehen&s;ions are exceedingly heightened by the near Approach of <HI>Newmarket</HI> Meeting. In return to all which, the Proprietors only beg the Favour of Mr. <HI>Whitfield</HI> &s;eriou&s;ly to ask him&s;elf if he really thinks the pre&s;ent Mode of Vice can actually be encrea&s;ed? or, if any Kind of it can be introduc'd new? and, whether the <HI>Appearance of Utility,</HI> as he is plea&s;ed to call it (by which he mu&s;t mean, if he means any thing, the e&s;tabli&s;hing a Breed of Centaurs here, as of Mules abroad) would not of it&s;elf be enough to deter even a fine Gentleman from a Crime? So that they have all the Rea&s;on in the World to flatter them&s;elves, that if their Shew were of Con&s;equence enough to bring about any
<PB N="8" REF="8" MS="Y">
Change in the pre&s;ent Ta&s;te, it is impo&s;&s;ible it &s;hould not be for the better; and that &s;o far from being chargeable with giving a helping Hand to the Depravity of their Country, they &s;hould de&s;erve Thanks for having dimini&s;hed it, or at lea&s;t turn'd it to the publick Advantage. So much for Mr. <HI>Whitfield;</HI> notwith&s;tanding who&s;e Remon|&s;trance, the Proprietors would not have &s;o long deferr'd producing their Centaur to the Publick, (as is evident from the former Notice they gave, for the &s;eventh of the pre&s;ent Month) if they had not thought it incumbent upon them&s;elves to po&s;tpone it, out of Re&s;pect to a Troop of Per&s;ons of Di|&s;tinction, who thought proper to make a Shew of them&s;elves at that Time. They own be&s;ides, their own Intere&s;t directed them not to let any thing &s;o extraordinary inter|fere with what they had to produce, as the fir&s;t Run of Curio&s;ity and Surpri&s;e, is the only Harve&s;t they have to reckon upon from the Town, having con&s;tantly ob&s;erv'd that very little Time is requi&s;ite to familiari&s;e it to the greate&s;t Mon&s;ters in Nature.</P>
<P>As this is the Ca&s;e, it is hop'd it will not be taken ami&s;s that Mr. <HI>Manpferdt</HI> is no longer &s;hewn for Nothing, as he has been for this Fortnight pa&s;t, in private, to many of the Nobility and Virtuo&s;i, nor indeed has that Satisfaction been refus'd to any of either Denomination, except to Mr. <HI>Whi&s;ton,</HI>
<PB N="9" REF="9" MS="Y">
which was done by Mr. <HI>Manp$erdt</HI>'s own De&s;ire, not caring, as he &s;aid, to run the Ri&s;que of &s;eeing any thing that might hap|pen to fall from him in Conver&s;ation, make its Appearance in &s;ome future Memoir, where the Shape it &s;hould come forth in would depend (whatever his Opinion might be as to Mr. <HI>Whi&s;ton</HI>'s Hone&s;ty) &s;o much upon his Memory. Nor has any body been admitted to &s;ee him for Nothing, for &s;ome Days pa&s;t, except one Lady, who it cou'd not be refu&s;ed to, as &s;he had come on Pur|po&s;e as far as from be yond <HI>Red-Lion-Square,</HI> upon the Faith of &s;eeing him <HI>gratis,</HI> and gave her Word &s;he would not have come upon any other Con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>But we have been hurry'd away from our main Purpo&s;e, which was the giving a particular Account of the wonderful Centaur, by two the mo&s;t fooli&s;h and u&s;ele&s;s Motives imaginable, that of complaining to the World, and of ju&s;tifying one&s;elf to it; for to tell that one has been ill u&s;ed, is to encourage others to &s;erve you in the &s;ame Manner; and to ju&s;tify one&s;elf is de&s;troying the only Chance one can have for Favour, which is never be&s;tow'd, but upon the Sup|po&s;ition of one's being to blame.</P>
<P>We &s;hall therefore proceed a little more regularly for the future, if we can, and here we imagine it will be expected of us to give &s;ome Account of what the learned Profe&s;&s;or
<PB N="10" REF="10">

<P>From our Account of this Fir&s;t Book, we are willing to flatter our&s;elves the Reader will excu&s;e us the Detail of all the re&s;t; what follows we are glad to have the Authority of the learned <HI>Zeiglerus</HI> for, who,
<PB N="14" REF="14" MS="Y">
as he took the pains to convey him&s;elf upon the Spot, for his better Information, and as nothing material in his Account has been contradicted, by the many Letters, Certi|ficates, and Atte&s;tations, which the Proprietors have been at the pains of collecting from thence, we imagine it cannot fail of command|ing the Belief of every rea&s;onable Reader.</P>
<P>"MR. <HI>Jehan-Paul-Erne&s;t-Chri&s;tian-Lodowic Manpferdt,</HI> the wonderful Centaur, was foal'd the 19th of <HI>May,</HI> N.

Weight; afterwards be burnt together with the Filly-Centaur, and their A&s;hes thrown into the Air; that his Farm &s;hould be confi&s;cated to the U&s;es of the Society, as well as the Mare which had produced the Centaur, to whom in their Mercy they remitted the Penalty of burning &s;he had incurr'd, in Con&s;ideration of the great Ser|vices &s;he might be of to the Society, after &s;he &s;hould be duly exorcis'd; the Execution of the Filly to be re&s;pited for Six Days, as well in hopes <HI>Holtzbawer</HI> might be taken in the mean time, as to give the Country an Opportunity of a&s;&s;embling at &s;o uncommon a Sight.</P>
<P>During <HI>Holtzbawer</HI>'s Retreat in the Mountains, there happen'd to him an Accident &s;o uncommon and &s;o unparallel'd by any thing one &s;ees in the World, that the Author <HI>(Zeiglerus)</HI> can't help appealing to his own Character, and asking whether it is at all probable, that with the Reputa|tion he thanks Heaven he has e&s;tabli&s;hed of him&s;elf where he is known, for a Man of Veracity and Plain-dealing, he &s;hould ri&s;que it all for the Sake of giving an Air of Novel to a Hi&s;tory &s;o well known and atte&s;ted, as this he is compiling, if he did not actually believe what he is going to relate, and had not taken all human Means for di&s;covering the Truth: it is this: that notwith&s;tanding this Farmer was ab&s;olutely &s;tripp'd of every

thing he had po&s;&s;e&s;s'd, a Pea&s;ant (he had been remarkably kind to from his Infancy, edu|cating him in his Hou&s;e, and behaving to him in all Re&s;pects in the mo&s;t tender and affectionate Manner, even &s;o far as to give every body Rea&s;on to believe he de&s;igned to to make him his Heir) in&s;tead of either &s;eiz|ing upon <HI>Holtzbawer,</HI> as he might ea&s;ily have done, being a younger and &s;tronger Man, or getting a Reward, for di&s;covering his Hiding-place, as one would naturally have expected, not only faithfully kept his Secret, but was a means of pre&s;erving his Life, by the Advice he gave, which was, for them two to &s;teal down privately from the Mountains, the Night before the intend|ed Execution, and convey away the Mare and her Infant, by &s;hewing of whom it was propo&s;ed to &s;upport them&s;elves. This they happily effected, and by ea&s;y Journeys over tho&s;e wild and uncultivated Places arrived &s;afe with their Charge in <HI>Piedmont.</HI> It was thus the wonderful Mr. <HI>Manpferdt</HI> e&s;caped the Fate that had approached &s;o &s;o clo&s;e to him, while ignorant of what Sen|tence he lay under, he was trotting, and crying, with his Thumb in his Mouth after the Mare his Mother."</P>
<P>Thus far the accurate <HI>Zeiglerus,</HI> whom we don't think it nece&s;&s;ary for us to follow any farther in his Account of the Education of Mr. <HI>Manpferdt,</HI> nor what Courts he has

<P>There is one Thing however, we think we ought to warn all tho&s;e of, who de&s;ign us the Honour of coming to our wonderful Show, that notwith&s;tanding the &s;olid Sen&s;e Mr. <HI>Manpferdt</HI> &s;hews upon many Occa&s;ions, we never could by any Rea&s;oning, Per&s;ua&s;ion, or Terror, prevail upon him to forbear Dung|ing or Staling, before whatever Company happens to be pre&s;ent; but tho' we will not pretend to &s;ay, he is quite &s;o inoffen&s;ive at &s;uch Times as tho&s;e who are only Hor&s;es, yet as Per&s;ons always attend with Mops, Pails and Shovels of Sand, to remove in&s;tant|ly whatever may be trouble&s;ome to delicate No&s;es, and as there is always ready a Cha|fingdi&s;h with lighted Coals, to throw Frank|incen&s;e upon, if any Thing of that Nature &s;hould happen, we hope it will not deter any body from giving us the Honour of their Company. Nor has any body hitherto of that extraordinary Number that has already been to &s;ee Mr. <HI>Manpferdt,</HI> expre&s;&s;ed any remarkable Di&s;like at this Accident, ex|cept a <HI>Scotch</HI> Gentleman, and a <HI>Dutch</HI> Mer|chant from the City, the two People upon Earth, who, after having made Cleanline&s;s a Plague to them&s;elves and every body that comes nigh them, remain dirtier than their Neighbours.

<HI>Manpferdt</HI> is unaccountably liable to, (tho' very ea&s;ily prevented by the Pre&s;ence of any one of the Proprietors with a Whip in his Hand, without which Precaution he will never be &s;hewn in Public) is the Propen&s;ity he has to all kinds of Indecency and Lewdne&s;s in his Talk. This is what the Town will readily believe we &s;hould not have apprized it of, if we could not take it upon our&s;elves, to an&s;wer; that his Conver|&s;ation, while any of us is by, is nothing but what the nice&s;t Lady may hear without blu&s;hing, even tho' her Father or Husband were pre&s;ent. We thought it nece&s;&s;ary to mention this Article, as it is a Circum&s;tance that has been endeavoured to be made an ill U&s;e of by Per&s;ons hinted at above, who have aggravated it to &s;o great a Degree as to have given out, that he actually put a cer|tain Lady of Quality out of Countenance, by his Talk; which is a Reflection both upon her and him, that there is not the lea&s;t Foundation in Fact for.</P>
<P>The Proprietors have agreed upon con|fining the Time of Shewing, between the Hours of Ten in the Morning, and Four in the Afternoon, the re&s;t of the Day being requi&s;ite for Mr. <HI>Manpferdt</HI> to comb and curry him&s;elf, and &s;tir up his own Litter, and &s;tudy the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Hi&s;tory, which he begins to be tolerably expert in, tho' we will not pretend, but that he is apt to make
<PB N="20" REF="20" MS="Y">
&s;ome Blunders in it, and when that once happens (from a kind of Stupidity in him, whether owing to the Hor&s;e, or <HI>Swi&s;s</HI> Part of him we can't tell) it is impo&s;&s;ible to &s;et him right again, for he always reverts. Thus, tho' we have explained to him a hun|dred times the Nature of the Union, he &s;till per&s;i&s;ts in rea&s;oning upon it, as of the Union of <HI>France</HI> with <HI>Scotland.</HI> Be&s;ides, he requires a great deal of time for his Meals, as he eats very plentifully, and pretty lei&s;urely: His favou|rite Diet is an immen&s;e Quantity of Greens, with boil'd Beef, or a Peas-pudding as big as a Peck and &s;ome Pork; which he does not eat together, but the Greens or Pudding fir&s;t, and afterwards the Beef or Pork mo|derately: As in Drinking, he will fir&s;t pour down a couple of Gallons of Water, or, if he has a Cold, of warm Ma&s;h, and immediately after takes a Gla&s;s of Wine, or a Draught of Porter, in which he is tolerably tempe|rate; the immen&s;e Quantity of Claret re|ported to have been drank between a Right Honourable as well as Right Learned Per&s;on and him, being a downright Forgery; the more malicious, as it is partly founded upon Truth: For tho' Mr. <HI>Manpferdt</HI> was per|fectly fober at breaking up, yet People would not believe but he mu&s;t be drunk, as he &s;eemed to rely upon a Promi&s;e, the Right Honourable Per&s;on had &s;eriou&s;ly made him

before they began to drink, of getting him a Run at fre&s;h Gra&s;s this Spring.</P>
<P>The Proprietors will not trouble the Pub|lic, with any farther Detail of Mr. <HI>Manp|ferdt</HI> at pre&s;ent, as it will be, in &s;o &s;hort a Time, capable of making a Judgment of him for it&s;elf. If therefore we &s;uppre&s;s any other Particularities and Oddities of his, it is not from any De&s;ire of concealing them, knowing that they mu&s;t rather recommend than depreciate him to a FREE PEOPLE, who place the only Advantage they have by being &s;uch, in daring to indulge them|&s;elves in every Oddity that comes into their Heads; and we are willing to believe, that when the re&s;t come to be known, they will be of no more Prejudice to us, than we find one already mentioned, his Licentiou&s;|ne&s;s in Talk is likely to be of: For notwith|&s;tanding that has been &s;o maliciou&s;ly &s;pread, and univer&s;ally known, we hear that many Ladies are de&s;irous of a private Conver&s;ation with him; for which Rea&s;on it is thought proper to give this Notice, that one may be be&s;poke at any Time, after this pre&s;ent Month of <HI>March,</HI> upon only &s;ending Word the Evening before, and appointing the Hour, and leaving Five Guineas by the Me&s;&s;enger.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Manpferdt</HI> propo&s;es, as &s;oon as the Time of his Engagement to us, &s;hall be expired, to let him&s;elf out by the Morning
<PB N="22" REF="22">
to Ladies, who &s;hall be di&s;po&s;ed for an Airing in <HI>Hyde-park,</HI> the King's Roads, or any Jaunt within Five Miles of Town. He has all his Paces exceeding ea&s;y, and is not at all &s;ubject to trip: He will fix a certain Rate for his Carriage by the Hour, and leave to their Genero&s;ity to give him whatever they plea&s;e for his Trouble of At|tendance. He hopes this De&s;ign of his, will rai&s;e no new Objection in the City, to the Naturalization Act, of which tho' he pro|po&s;es to take the Benefit; yet he is willing to give any Secrity, which &s;hall be required, that he will not carry any Ladies from that Part of the Town, 'till they are become People of Quality.</P>
<P>The Proprietors flatter them&s;elves, that con&s;idering the va&s;t Charges they have been at, it will not be thought dear, if they fix the Price, of &s;eeing the <HI>Centaur</HI> at <HI>Five Shillings</HI> each, to the Nobility and Gentry; others will be admitted for <HI>One Shilling:</HI> and we tru&s;t to the Genero&s;ity of the former two, that they will not impo&s;e upon tho&s;e ap|pointed for Receivers at the Door, by being better dre&s;&s;ed than u&s;ually of Mornings.</P>
<P>All Per&s;ons are de&s;ired not to give them|&s;elves the Trouble of coming before the fir&s;t of next Month, as they can upon no Con&s;i|deration whatever be admitted.</P>
