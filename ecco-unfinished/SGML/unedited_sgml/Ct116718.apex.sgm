<P>WHEN Ari&s;tophanes fir&s;t heard of the late Sir F. B. Delaval's death, the &s;hock of lo|&s;ing &s;o intimate a friend had &s;uch an effect up|on him, that he bur&s;t into tears, retired to his room, and &s;aw no company for the whole day. Next day at noon coming down to his dinner, he a&s;ked his trea&s;urer, with &s;wollen eyes, when they intended burying him? "Not till next week," replied the other, "as the &s;urgeons are fir&s;t to examine his brea&s;t and <HI>head&punc;"</HI> This la&s;t word recovered the wit's fancy, and repeating it with &s;ome &s;urpri&s;e, a&s;ked, <Q>&startq;And what the De|vil will they get there? I'm &s;ure, &s;ays he, I've known poor Frank the&s;e five and twenty years, and I never could find <HI>any thing</HI> in it.&endq;</Q></P>
<P>The death of the late Mr. Holland of Drury|lane (who was the &s;on of a baker at Chi&s;wick) had likewi&s;e a very great effect on Ari&s;tophanes's
<PB N="4" REF="4">
&s;pirits when fir&s;t he heard of it. Being appoin|ted by the will of the decea&s;ed as one of his bearers, he attended the corp&s;e to the family vault at Chi&s;wick, and there very &s;incerely paid a plentiful tribute of tears to his memory. On his return to town he called at the Bedford cof|fee hou&s;e, when an acquaintance coming up to him, a&s;ked him, if he had not been paying the la&s;t compliment to his friend Holland? "Yes, poor boy," replies Foote, (&s;niveling at the &s;ame time) <Q>&startq;I've ju&s;t been &s;eeing him <HI>&s;hoved</HI> into the <HI>family even.</HI>&endq;</Q></P>
<P>Davies, one of Foote's familiars, was one day admiring his ma&s;ter's performance on the &s;tage, and exclaiming in the highe&s;t terms of his abi|lities: a plain, &s;ober man hearing his extrava|gant prai&s;es without emotion, turned to the per&s;on next to him, and a&s;ked him, what he thought of his acting, "for," &s;ays he, "I don't mind Da|vies, for Foote and he play into one another's hands."</P>
<P>A gentleman calling on Foote, at North-$nd, found him drinking coffee by the &s;ide of a piece of water in his ground; as he approached, he ob&s;erved a &s;mart, dapper man walking ha&s;tily a|way. Says Foote, "I have been at cards, and lo&s;t &s;ome ca&s;h with that youth; however, it is well for him, for he was in want of two things which I have &s;upplied him with&punc;" "What are they?" &s;ays the gentleman. <HI>"Money and wit."</HI></P>
<P>Foote travelling to the north once, put up at a bye inn on the road, where he was $ather di&s;|tre&s;&s;ed
<PB N="5" REF="5">
for want of accommodations. "What," &s;ays he, "have you no cold meat in the hou&s;e, landlord?" "No, Sir," &s;ays the ho&s;t, "we have not dre&s;&s;ed any for &s;ome days, as my poor wi&s;e lays dead up &s;tairs." "Zounds!" &s;ays Foote, "never complain again of your larder, for there is no cold meat equal to a dead wife."</P>
<P>When Foote brought out his puppet&punc;&s;how at the Hay-market, it was reported, that he had procured in wood the likene&s;&s;es of the principal performers at the theatres. A gentleman there|fore took an opportunity of calling&punc; at his play|hou&s;e, and &s;eeing a figure hang up, he &s;aid with &s;ome emotion, "Ble&s;s me! that is very like Woodward." "Yes," &s;ays Foote, "&s;o it is; and I expect Garrick's home from the turner's every minute." He afterwards compen&s;ated for this je&s;t, in a conver&s;ation with Punch, by &s;ay|ing, "We have got Garrick's head in the hou&s;e, but we want his brains."</P>
<P>Mr. Colman u&s;ed always to &s;ay of Foote's jokes, they were fuller's earth, and rubbed off when dry.</P>
<P>A certain comedian, who was formerly a cook, fought a duel with a gentleman of the theatre. This being mentioned to Foote, he an&s;wered, "Yes, damn him for an ungrateful fellow, 'twas I took the &s;pit from the fire, put it by his &s;ide, and made him a gentleman"</P>
<P>Mr. Foote dining one day with Lord Town|&s;hend, after his duel with Lord Bell$mont, the wine being bad, and the dinner ill-dre&s;&s;ed, made
<PB N="6" REF="6">
Foote ob&s;erve to his Lord&s;hip, that he could not di&s;cover what rea&s;on could compel his Lord&s;hip to take up arms, when he might have effected his purpo&s;e another way, and with much more $a&s;e to him&s;elf. "Why, how," replied his Lord|&s;hip, "could I have acted otherwi&s;e?" "How!" replied Foote, "you &s;hould have invited him to dine with your Lord&s;hip, as you have done me, and poi&s;oned him."</P>
<P>Di&s;$$u$&s;i$g one day with Lord Mansfield, he mentioned that his patent was confined, and that be wi&s;hed to have it extended for the perfor|mance of plays in the winter; for which pur|po&s;e, continued Foote, I drew up a petition to his Maje&s;ty&mdash;"Well," &s;ays my Lord, "and what an&s;wer did he give you, Mr Foote?" "My Lord," replied the wag, "he paid no more attention to it, than if all the people of England had petitioned him."</P>
<P>Foote dining at the Ca&s;tle at Richmond, when Lady Harrington had al&s;o a party at the &s;ame tavern, there was a di&s;pute about a room, when Foote meeting her Lady&s;hip, &s;aid, "I have &s;et|tled the di&s;pute, my Lady; I a&s;&s;ured them, that the room which my company had got, could not be your Lady&s;hip's, <HI>for there was no bed in it."</HI></P>
<P>Tom O&s;borne, the Book&s;eller, who was a man of a $$$rvy habit of body, and had i&s;&s;ues in his back and arms, di&s;charged his gardiner &s;ud|denly, whom Foote hired without a character. The$e oppo&s;ite beings meeting at a veni&s;on fea&s;t in Hamp&s;tead, Mr. O&s;borne attacked him for
<PB N="7" REF="7">
taking a man without enquiring his character. "Sir," &s;ays Foote, "the man told me, you put him to a wrong u&s;e, and not to the bu&s;ine&s;s of his profe&s;&s;ion, for you made him plant peas in your back, and not in your garden."</P>
<P>A lady being le$t a great fortune by her hu&s;|band, &s;he married immediately. On the day of the marriage, a gentleman meeting Lord Lyt|tleton, &s;aid, "Has your Lord&s;hip heard the news to-day?&mdash;Lady *** is married to Captain ***?" "No," replied his Lord&s;hip, "this is news to me, indeed; <HI>for I laid with her la&s;t night, and &s;he never mentioned a word about it."</HI></P>
<P>Mr. W&mdash;meeting with Mr. G&mdash;who had been reading his own works at court, W&mdash;a&s;ked him, if this was his idea of elegant retire|ment; to read his own works to the dulle&s;t man in the nation, a German woman, who knew not a word of the language, and a parcel of untutor|ed children out of the nur&s;ery&mdash;Oh, what a &s;al|ling off is here!</P>
<P>A certain gentleman of the &s;tage, celebrated for his conjugal &s;idelity, was often &s;aying in com|pany with Foote, that he had not laid from his wife once in twenty years. "May be not," &s;ays Foote, "nor with her."</P>
<P>Politicks being one day the topick of Foote's table, he humourou&s;ly pun'd on the reigns of the three Georges, thus; King George the fir&s;t had a turbulent, &s;tormy <HI>rain</HI>&mdash;King George the &s;econd had a fertile and refre&s;hing <HI>rain</HI>&mdash;but George the third has nothing more than a dull Scots mi&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="8">
Foote frequently u&s;ed to de&s;cribe the mi&s;er|able petit &s;tate of $trelitz, by &s;aying, that when a vi&s;itor came unexpectedly, they were obliged to lie three in a bed.</P>
<P>Foote $ining on a turtle, at the ca&s;tle at Rich|mond; when he had got into his chario$, and was goingaway, a tall, lank, &s;l$ek fellow of an ho&s;|tler came to the carriage, with a demure face, and &s;ays to Foote, "I hope, Sir, you will remem|ber the ho&s;tler." "I believe I &s;hall," &s;ays he, "when I &s;ee you again." The an&s;wer petrified the fellow, and he drove off, leaving him motion|le&s;s.</P>
<P>Lord K&mdash;, who had a remarkable large, round, red face, took lodgings next to Foote's, and the back window of his room looked into the wit's garden. Foote walking one cold morning in the &s;pring into his melon-ground, di&s;cover|ed his Lord&s;hip in the window. "Good morning to your Lord&s;hip." Says my Lord, "It is a very chill morning, Mr. Foote." Yes," &s;ays the wag, "it is, and I wi&s;h your Lord&s;hip would do me the honour to turn your counte|nance upon my cucumbers."</P>
<P>Foote coming down the Hay-market, a beg|gar a&s;ked him for a half-penny; he gave him a &s;h$l$ing, &s;aying&punc; "Whenever you &s;ee a gentle|man like my&s;elf never offend him, by a&s;king for a hal$-penny."</P>
<P>A gentleman a&s;ked Foote one day in a very formal manner, whether he had any i&s;&s;ue? "Yes," replied the wag, "I have two running, Sir, and you are welcome to 'em both."</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="9">
When Wilkes was lord-mayor, Foote attend|ed the Ea&s;ter dinner, and leaning on a friend's arm, he was greatly crouded, where he ob&s;erved a large woman very big with child&mdash;Zounds!" &s;ays the friend, "I wi&s;h we were out of this croud." "Ay," &s;ays Foote, turning to the wo|man, "and if this lady was delivered too, there would be no harm in it"</P>
<P>Dr Gold&s;mith was, without exception, the vaine&s;t man of his per&s;on, and a man of the plaine&s;t per&s;on you could &s;ee; when he dined with Foote, he u&s;ed to place him&s;elf at table op|po&s;ite a large pier-gla&s;s, in which the Doctor would be always admiring him&s;elf, and neglect his victuals; however, vanity led the Doctor to the thoughts of matrimony, and he believed a beautiful young lady where he vi&s;ited was much in love with him. The&s;e trifles got air, and &s;ome of the particulars were mentioned in a pa|per publi&s;hed by Evans, in Paterno&s;ter-row. The Doctor, incen&s;ed, flew to the &s;hop, and when he entered, the book&s;eller was &s;tooping for &s;omething behind the c$unter; Gold&s;mith, not regarding that, &s;truck him with his cane, and knocked him down; the man a&s;toni&s;hed and con$ounded got up, and beat the Doctor &s;o &s;e|verely, that he was confined for &s;ome time for the impetuo&s;ity of his temper.</P>
<P>Foote, who&s;e talent lay in lampooning and mi|micry, even in his early days, had once got the knack of imitating a late general officer, in the &s;hrug of his &s;houlders, the li&s;ping of his &s;peech, and &s;ome other things for which the General
<PB N="10" REF="10">
was remarkable, that it grew a common topic a|mong his acquaintance, who u&s;ed to &s;ay, "Come, Sam, let us have the General's company." A friend, at length, acquainted the officer of it, who &s;ent for Foote: "Sir," &s;ays the General, "I hear you have an excellent talent at mimick|ing characters, and among the re&s;t, I find I have been the &s;ubject of your ridicule." "Oh, Lord, Sir," &s;ays Foote, with great plea&s;antry, "I take all my acquaintance off at times, and what is more particular. I often take m$&s;elf off." "Gad &s;o&punc;" &s;ays the other, "pray let us have a &s;peci|men." Foote on this, puts on his hat and gloves, takes hold of his cane, and making a &s;hort bow, le$t the room. The officer waited &s;ome minutes for his return; but at length, on enquiry, found he had really taken him&s;elf off, by leaving the hou&s;e. The officer was Gen&punc; Blakene$, with whom he was afterwards in the &s;tricte&s;t friend|&s;hip</P>
<P>When Sir Thomas Robin&s;on's &s;hares of Rane|lagh were to be &s;old, a gentleman calling upon Foote, the wit a&s;ked him, if he had any money to $pare; "For if you have," &s;ay he, "you'll find a &s;hare of Ranelagh to be a good thing, for G.&punc;and all the Jews are after the pur|cha&s;e"</P>
<P>Mrs. Foote, mother of Ari&s;tophanes, was of a very whim&s;ical turn of mind, and experienced the caprice of fortune nearly as much as her &s;on. The day &s;he was &s;ent pri&s;oner to the King's-Bench, Foote was taken to a &s;punging-hou&s;e, when the following laconic letters pa&s;&s;ed between the mother
<PB N="11" REF="11">
and &s;on: "Dear Sam, I am in pri&s;on." "Dear mother, &s;o am I."</P>
<P>Foote attended the theatre one evening, when a new lady appeared with &s;ome gleam <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Churchill, in his Ro&s;ciad, thus &s;peaks of this lady.</P>
<Q><L>"Happy in this, behold amid&s;t the throng,</L>
<L>"With tran&s;ient gleams of grace, Hart &s;weeps a|long."</L></Q></NOTE>of grace. Foote a&s;ked a gentleman by him, what was the lady's name? "Reddi&s;h, Sir," &s;ays the &s;tranger. "It is Hor&s;e-Reddi&s;h then, by G&mdash;d," &s;ays he.</P>
<P>Foote's tallow chandler came to him one mor|ning, with a very long face, telling him a dole|ful tale, as how his &s;hop had been broken open, and a great quantity of candles &s;tolen out of it; "Well," &s;ays Foote, "never mind it, my dear Grea&s;y, they will all come to light again in time."</P>
<P>Mr. Foote, in his return from Bath, dined at the Ca&s;tle at Salt-hill; the bill being very ex|travagant, he &s;ent for the landlady&mdash;"Pray, Madam," &s;ays he, "is not your name Partridge?" "Yes, Sir." "I think it &s;hould have been Wood|cock, by the length of your bill."</P>
<P>Mr. Foote attending with Sir John St. Alban, Mr. Fielding's examination into the legality of the Harmonic Meeting, &s;aid, the$e were no want of amu&s;ements, there were the two play-hou&s;es, the opera&punc;hou&s;e in the Hay market, and oppo&s;ite, the facetious <HI>Ari&s;tophanes.</HI> "Who?" &s;ays Sir
<PB N="12" REF="12">
John&punc; <HI>"Harry Stephens, "replied Foote.</HI> "What," the man that reads lectures upon heads?" "The &s;ame." "I know him well," replied the knight.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Sherry playing a part at Drury-lane, a per&s;on a&s;ked Foote, what he thought of the Sher|ry? "Oh!" &s;ays the wag, "it is pricked."</P>
<P>A gentleman meeting Foote in his carriage, drawn by four duns, exclaimed, "I am glad to &s;ee, Sam, that you drive the duns." Foote an|&s;wered, "And &s;o am I, for they have driven me a long time."</P>
<P>In the manors of Ea&s;t and We&s;t-Enborne, in the county of Berks, and el&s;ewhere, the inhabi|tants have the following antient cu&s;tom. "If a cu$tomary tenant die, the widow &s;hall have what the law calls her Free-Bench in all his co|py-hold lands, <HI>dum &s;ola &amp; ca&s;ta &s;uerit,</HI> that is, while &s;he lives &s;ingle and cha&s;te; but if &s;he com|mits incontinency, &s;he forfeits her e&s;tate; yet if &s;he will come into the court riding upon a black ram, with his tail in her hand, and &s;ay the words following, the &s;teward is bound by the cu&s;tom to re admit her to her Free-Bench.</P>
<LG>
<L>Here I am,</L>
<L>Riding upon a black ram,</L>
<L>Like a whore as I am;</L>
<L>And $or my crin$um crancum,</L>
<L>Have lo&s;t my bincum bancum;</L>
<L>And, for my $a$l's game,</L>
<L>Have done this wordly &s;hame,</L>
<L>Therefore, I pray you, Mr. Steward, let me have my land again."</L>
</LG>
<P><PB N="13" REF="13">
"I have, according to my promi&s;e, been at great pains in &s;earching out the records of the black ram; and have at la&s;t met with the pro|ceedings of the court-baron, held in that behalf, for the &s;pace of a whole day. The record &s;aith, that a &s;trict inqui&s;ition having been made into the right of the tenants to their &s;everal e&s;tates, by a crafty old &s;teward, he found that many of the lands of the manor were, by default of the &s;everal widows, forfeited to the lord, and accor|dingly would have entered on the premi&s;es: up|on which the good women demanded the bene|fit of the ram. The &s;teward, after having peru|&s;ed their &s;everal pleas, adjourned the court to Barnaby-bright, that they might have day enough before them.</P>
<P>The court being &s;et, and filled with a great concour&s;e of people, who came from all parts to &s;ee the &s;olemnity, the fir&s;t who entered was the widow Frontly, who had made her appearance in the la&s;t year's cavalcade. The regi&s;ter ob&s;erves, that finding it an ea&s;y pad-ram, and fore&s;eeing &s;he might have further occa&s;ion for it, &s;he purcha&s;ed it of the &s;teward.</P>
<P>Mrs. Sarah Dainty, relict of Mr. John Dain|ty, (who was the greate&s;t prude in the pari&s;h) came next in the proce&s;&s;ion. She at fir&s;t made &s;ome difficulty of taking the tail in her hand; and was ob&s;erved in p onouncing the form of penance, to &s;often the two mo&s;t emphatical words into clincum clancum: But the &s;teward took care to make her &s;peak plain Engli&s;h, before he would let her have her land again.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="14">
The third widow that was brought to this worldly &s;hame, being mounted upon a vicious ram, had the misfortune to be thrown by him: upon which &s;he hoped to be excu&s;ed from going through the re&s;t of the ceremony: but the &s;te|ward being well ver&s;ed in the law, ob&s;erved ve|ry wi&s;ely upon this occa&s;ion, that the breaking of the rope does not hinder the execution of the criminal.</P>
<P>The fourth lady upon record was the widow Ogle, a famous coquette, who had kept half a &s;core young fellows off and on for the &s;pace of two years; but having been more kind to her carter John, &s;he was introduced with the huzzas of all her lovers about her.</P>
<P>Mrs Sable appearing in her weeds, which were very new and fre&s;h, and of the &s;ame colour with her whim&s;ical Palfrey, made a very decent figure in the &s;ole$$ity</P>
<P>Another, who had been &s;ummoned to make her appearance, was xcu&s;ed by the &s;teward&punc; as well knowing in his heart, that the good &s;quire him&s;elf had qualified her for the ram.</P>
<P>Mrs Quick having nothing to object again&s;t the indictment, pleaded her belly. But it was remembred that &s;he made the &s;ame excu&s;e the year before. Upon which the &s;teward ob&s;erved that &s;he might &s;o contrive it, as never to do the &s;ervice of the manor.</P>
<P>The widow Fidget being cited into court, in|&s;i&s;ted that &s;he had done no more &s;ince the death of her hu&s;band, than what &s;he u&s;ed to do in his life-time; and withal de&s;ired Mr. &s;teward to con|&s;ider
<PB N="15" REF="15">
his own wife's ca&s;e if he &s;hould chance to die before her.</P>
<P>The next in order was a Dowager of a very corpulent make, who would have been excu&s;ed, as not finding any ram that was able to carry her; upon which the &s;teward commuted her puni&s;h|ment, and ordered her to make her entry upon a black ox.</P>
<P>The widow Ma&s;kwell, a woman who had long lived with mo&s;t unblemi&s;hed character, having turned off her old chambermaid in a pet, was by that revengeful creature brought in upon the black ram nine times the &s;ame day.</P>
<P>Several widows of the neighbourhood, being brought upon their trial, &s;hewed that they did not hold of the manor, and were di&s;charged ac|cordingly.</P>
<P>A pretty young creature who clo&s;ed the pro|ce&s;&s;ion came ambling in, with &s;o bewitching an air, that the &s;teward was ob&s;erved to ca&s;t a &s;heep's eye upon her, and married her within a month after the death of his wife"</P>
<P>A clergyman (who was remarkable for his dirty hands) conver&s;ing with Foote, was explain|ing how much he had improved his living, "For," &s;ays he, "I have taken all the tythes in|to my own $ands." "Yes," &s;ays Foote, "I &s;ee you have, Doctor, <HI>and the glebe too."</HI></P>
<P>Mr. P&mdash;v&mdash;s, the old page, had frequently invited Mr. Foote to dine at St. James's; at la&s;t, Foote accepted the invitation. Being &s;eated at table, he was given to under&s;tand, that part of a German boar was ordered by his M&mdash;for their
